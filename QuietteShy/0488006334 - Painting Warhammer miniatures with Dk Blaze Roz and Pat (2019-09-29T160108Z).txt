[0:08:55] <%FromThe70s> MiloChristiansen That sounds like an issue with that channel's bot, not Twitch in general

[0:10:59] <MiloChristiansen> I really like how killing normal enemies keeps the circle large.
[0:11:03] <Realterminal> I'd rather we had something more interesting than simple invulnerability periods. I'd rather the entire fight be about engaging with mechanics that take down the health.
[0:11:17] <+PositiveJCurve> No it‚Äôs just kinda boring
[0:11:19] <%Zedimonx5> We need 20 more sergeants KappaRoss

[0:11:45] <Bulkycrow> How bout some scaling resistance on boss and more complex mechs? I like they implement fazes in fights, but in most mmorpg's u sometimes have to keep in mind 5 mechs that go at the same time at boss fights
[0:11:57] <toasatoshi> first time catching the stream! just dropping in to say hi
[0:12:00] <Kutakai666> yup
[0:12:08] <%heyello> There is also the Profit taker orb fight which is just difficulty by cc
[0:12:08] <%corrosivePaladin> Yes there is a damage cap
[0:12:09] <$FrostMass22> @sarahtsang My one regret is I didn't have enough to make the donation not look like spam
[0:12:09] <MiloChristiansen> There is.
[0:12:10] <alletse_avaratu> yep
[0:12:10] <DrMorphling> yes
[0:12:12] <%TheAngryChicken52> Def a damage cap
[0:12:13] <$Midashu> Always takes 5 lamps
[0:12:13] <$tonythetoad> yes there is a damage cap
[0:12:13] <%corrosivePaladin> You have to do 5 cycles
[0:12:14] <Nucleus_238> It's timed base
[0:12:15] <+TheSaintJohn> its like 25% total health
[0:12:16] <+Minegameboy> noice
[0:12:17] <Cobaltor_252> yup you can only do so much each time
[0:12:17] <$dirtyh4rr1> yeah, seems like it
[0:12:17] <Holy_Orders> seems to be
[0:12:18] <Starchildtw> Each phase seems to be dmg capped.
[0:12:20] <alletse_avaratu> there's a cap
[0:12:23] <$tonythetoad> You need three lamps
[0:12:24] <+alpharius88> yeah there is one
[0:12:26] <%Glitchesarecool> Yes
[0:12:33] <%Zedimonx5> There‚Äôs a cap DK
[0:12:37] <%TheAngryChicken52> lamp is still VERY charged before he destroys it because I deal a lot of damage
[0:12:42] <KTDelgado> it's a thyam fight with more steps

[0:13:31] <%jamesnathen2> im able to one shot everything with my plague kripath. the boss's health bar shows that this is sorta possible for a frame, but then just forces it to not after.

[0:13:58] <T3Benji> back in the day Warframe was dying
[0:14:02] <$FrostMass22> It's also great if you're coming into Warframe late because there is an OCEAN of content
[0:14:11] <alletse_avaratu> I haven't burnt out of it cause I've never really grinded anything hard like standing or MR or gear. ii just really started doing arbitrations this week
[0:14:12] <brrrn117> oh my bad, i never knew
[0:14:15] <KTDelgado> is it bad I got burned out with plains/venus open world
[0:14:17] <@SarahTsang> I was burnt out like years ago before Second Dream....
[0:14:37] <eanscrale> I honestly started because of pat.
[0:14:43] <%irisillych> pat's not the max? that's a shock
[0:14:43] <MiloChristiansen> "Warframe has content droughts!" Only if you are a multi-thousand hour vet who has done everything.
[0:14:56] <Naktibalda_> lol ye, i had a 4 year break and its great, just do that ez
[0:14:58] <$tonythetoad> I think it is now harder for them, because they need to do the step from infinite powerlevel with additional planets added as content vs. meaningfull large content drops
[0:14:58] <$FrostMass22> I also started Warframe because of Pat
[0:15:05] <@SarahTsang> My second burn out is slowly happening literally because of what happened with the lore with Khora
[0:15:10] <Tucker0603> I'm on and off since I already have my Oberon Prime, and my Silva and Aegis prime
[0:15:14] <+ExclusivelyPlastic> honestly I'm not really looking forward to the next nightwave because it means I'll have to play a lot again :/
[0:15:16] <Kutakai666> nah, @KTDelgado I haven't been to the open worlds much myself

[0:16:35] <Realterminal> Nah stuff that
[0:16:43] <%FromThe70s> It really is
[0:16:44] <Realterminal> I hate it when games tell me I can't equip what I want
[0:16:47] <$FrostMass22> Pat is used to saying stupid stuff
[0:16:50] <@SarahTsang> Yepppppp
[0:16:51] <Realterminal> I like being OP
[0:16:58] <%TWolfJaeger> Helping out friends who aren't very far into the game, completing the star map and doing the boss fights and unlocking Archwing stuff is what has been keeping me in the game.
[0:16:58] <Starchildtw> Who do I have to give a foot rub to, to get Shy's Glyph?
[0:16:58] <+TheSaintJohn> i don't think that's controversial
[0:17:01] <+legendfather_of_giants> just got here, which weapon
[0:17:08] <eanscrale> Part of me hope stalker mode is expanded into a more fleshed out invasion mode, but that would turn off a LOT of people.
[0:17:11] <@SarahTsang> @Starchildtw when giveaways happen
[0:17:11] <%irisillych> [crazy talk]
[0:17:12] <%KeynesianEconomist> Tigris Prime > everything else
[0:17:16] <@Roz_Lynd> win the glyph in a giveaway and no one's
[0:17:24] <icitoso> Why hello there
[0:17:25] <Realterminal> One thing I love about Warframe is that when I come back to it, all my hard work, hundreds of hours of effort is still there, and still relevant.
[0:17:25] <CrimsonGargoyle> that or you know, DE can actually balance the game. LUL
[0:17:27] <MiloChristiansen> Most of the time I carry a Dokram and a Rattleguts. Melee is my game, but I need something for nullifiers.
[0:17:30] <%heyello> Getting weapons in warframe seems almost trivial. Games like Borderlands seem to have "weight" (is that the right feeling) behind getting good weapons
[0:17:30] <zamzoph> I just got the Dark Imperium starter box set and wanna talk about painting Warhammer and protips....
[0:17:32] <@SarahTsang> @icitoso welcome!
[0:17:32] <Starchildtw> Ty Sarah.
[0:17:35] <~QuietteShy> as for the new boss thing and new weapon, i havent played warframe for like 4 days coz i was busy playing code vein and surge and other fun stuff, ill get to that new fucking melee next week
[0:17:41] <$tonythetoad> Doesn't matter. Then you go Valkyr get damage immunity and insane melee damage
[0:17:45] <%HEAVY_IS_REPLY> I suspect DE is well aware that Warframe's power indulgence is insane compared to other looter shooters.
[0:17:46] <%Glitchesarecool> Just rebalance them
[0:17:49] <%corrosivePaladin> Just nerf all the mods pogonaRool
[0:17:50] <$dirtyh4rr1> how about killing farming synergies as dialing down
[0:17:51] <Realterminal> Destiny meanwhile I'm always paranoid that everything I liked is gonna be nuked.
[0:17:57] <%FromThe70s> oops
[0:17:58] <+TheSaintJohn> surge 2 is really fun
[0:18:01] <$Midashu> Catchmoon is totally getting a nerf. Pablo said on his stream the other day out of all the secondary weapons, Catchmoon is the top 50% most used.
[0:18:04] <$dirtyh4rr1> skeleton died!
[0:18:06] <@SarahTsang> oh
[0:18:12] <$FrostMass22> New melee? did they rework how melee works?
[0:18:16] <Drk1Lucian> With rivens having been released a while ago, it's made a lot of other weapons more viable to use as well.
[0:18:16] <%norgthefish> Hello degenerates

[0:18:24] <+Manks> What reasoning could they add to only allow us to use 1 at a time that would make sense?
[0:18:25] <spartan_ermine> anime BLOOD souls it's so good
[0:18:26] <l058> I don‚Äôt have catchmoon am sad, but I‚Äôll have to make do with fulmin
[0:18:26] <CandideCamera> what they actually need is to rebalance the mod system like they hinted at for melee, but that's the most dangerous game when everyone's already done all the grinding
[0:18:29] <%KeynesianEconomist> isn't Code Vein just an anime Dark Souls?
[0:18:32] <Realterminal> Warframe is this outlier in my schedule of Destiny/Warframe/Flavor of the Month because it's the only thing that I can rely on to just be what it is.
[0:18:32] <zamzoph> Pat apatWhat
[0:18:34] <@SarahTsang> I've been busy bullying children with glasses as a goose
[0:18:41] <%heyello> And remnant is Gun Souls
[0:18:42] <Tucker0603> for me, I got my Oberon Prime, my Silva and Aegis prime and I was pretty much set for life.
[0:18:43] <DLUCKIEST> Do heavy weapons feel busted beyond reason in Code Vein?
[0:18:45] <BleedinActionMan> @FrostMass22 I think they're talking about the new Glaive
[0:18:51] <Dexord> melee is kinda busted in WF as it is since you can slap bloodrush and berserker on any weapon and just that makes is decent
[0:18:54] <Realterminal> And really, I don't think weapons are what matter in Warframe.
[0:18:55] <$tonythetoad> Dude, i played now a low level rescue mission and instead showing me the rescue target talking it was an empty pic with just the microphone stand
[0:18:57] <%irisillych> i started astral chain
[0:18:58] <%norgthefish> @SarahTsang I see you are a goose of culture
[0:18:59] <$FrostMass22> @bleedinactionman Ohhhh
[0:19:02] <%irisillych> got detailed by a good
[0:19:04] <%irisillych> *goose
[0:19:11] <Realterminal> More than anything, Warframes are what I love most about that game.
[0:19:15] <@SarahTsang> @norgthefish I finished it and i want more!!!!!!
[0:19:29] <@SarahTsang> I'm going to date Colonel Sanders next @irisillych
[0:19:30] <%norgthefish> Goose skin when
[0:19:43] <%FromThe70s> HONK
[0:19:43] <Realterminal> And I rotate between Atlas, Mesa, Chroma, Loki, Ember and Oberon constantly, and those are just my favorites.
[0:19:43] <%croxeye> Cheer100 twitch seems to have eaten my subscriber comment. so the gist is I feel that there needs to be a whole new Warframe game for them to fix the power creep. also DK how is weeb anor Londo?
[0:19:56] <%Hexagon_Angel> Hexagon_Angel subscribed with Twitch Prime. They've subscribed for 5 months! Little Misfortune is big gud
[0:20:03] <+Zxtole> Code Vein has way more customization for builds too, like the gift attacks are so sick
[0:20:11] <+TheSaintJohn> surge 1 has it's moments, but surge 2 def a step up
[0:20:16] <@SarahTsang> @croxeye thanks for the bits!!!
[0:20:16] <$FrostMass22> Is Surge any better than Lords of the Fallen?
[0:20:18] <%heyello> Are we gonna get Shy playing Untitled Goose Game? It seems like a great time to harass the locals
[0:20:19] <%Glitchesarecool> We will never get Warframe 2

[0:20:31] <%irisillych> @SarahTsang first you date the pigeons, now you're dating the guy who cooks the pigeons???
[0:20:33] <%Glitchesarecool> People would be too pissed that their progress would reset
[0:20:47] <DeadpanSoupcan> surge is faster than bloodborne
[0:20:48] <Realterminal> Thank fuck for that
[0:20:55] <+knitrogen> Loving shys nails
[0:21:02] <Realterminal> Sequels encourage devs to shake things up for no reason.
[0:21:09] <%heyello> There isn't a need to make sequels to a lot of games that have monetization as part of the game instead of the purchase. It increases longevity
[0:21:14] <$tonythetoad> What does quietteshy paint?
[0:21:17] <Realterminal> "Hey this works perfectly fine, FUCK THIS THING IN PARTICULAR!"
[0:21:25] <@SarahTsang> @irisillych it's important to date different people for choices.
[0:21:31] <Realterminal> Ala Destiny's weapon system in D2 vanilla
[0:21:36] <%norgthefish> hey @SarahTsang wanna do something fun?
[0:21:39] <Mathod> Its the Angriest Pat :o
[0:21:40] <$FrostMass22> @heyello Destiny should have been like that
[0:21:45] <@SarahTsang> @norgthefish depends!
[0:22:05] <%irisillych> @SarahTsang date the goose
[0:22:07] <%heyello> I totally agree, I don't think they needed a new game, more like an expansion like WOW
[0:22:13] <eanscrale> so it's like dragon tails.
[0:22:18] <@SarahTsang> @irisillych i wish >:(
[0:22:20] <Realterminal> Purple is the best color
[0:22:24] <zamzoph> IT'S BLUE
[0:22:24] <%BioKnight99> blue
[0:22:24] <DeadpanSoupcan> I think its opposite
[0:22:27] <Realterminal> And blue is my favorite color
[0:22:30] <eanscrale> Like eggplants.
[0:22:35] <DLUCKIEST> Purple is GOAT
[0:22:36] <$Cosmic_Warfighter> purple is my favorite color
[0:22:37] <%Razputin217> Blue Kappa
[0:22:38] <%norgthefish> @SarahTsang as for tradition of Norg day (my BD) I will do random stuff and drink cheap wine. also try to keep me out of hospital
[0:22:43] <+ExclusivelyPlastic> but that's not the point of sekiro
[0:22:43] <Fujiwara_92> it's blurple
[0:22:47] <l058> The color of space mom the betrayer
[0:22:51] <+Zxtole> Sekiro is way more tenchu than souls
[0:22:52] <%norgthefish> and I need to tie up Nightwave S2
[0:23:10] <Montiblanc> caught a livestream PogChamp BloodTrail
[0:23:16] <%KeynesianEconomist> On October first i have 1 of three games to play Destiny 2/ Farming Deathcube Prime/ or playing Endless Space 2 to crush Horatio again.
[0:23:34] <$FrostMass22> Sekiro is the James Cameron's Avatar of the Souls-like games
[0:23:37] <%irisillych> no cool hidden secrets like bloodborne?
[0:23:45] <@SarahTsang> @norgthefish take a shot for your age (i'm joking , don't do that)
[0:23:46] <+ExclusivelyPlastic> Every little bit of Sekiro's combat is based around using the one sword, the game would need to be completely redesigned to add more
[0:23:46] <%Zedimonx5> Man I hated the equip moves in Sekiro...
[0:23:50] <zamzoph> @QuietteShy Pat, do you not want to fight Tomoe?
[0:24:07] <%FromThe70s> Hoth
[0:24:08] <+Zxtole> Sekiro is sick, it's just a tenchu game so don't expect a souls game
[0:24:09] <smugjorgen> sekiro is more action/adventure while souls is RPG/adventure
[0:24:10] <%norgthefish> @SarahTsang I would have alot of wine left
[0:24:10] <Realterminal> Despite loving the Souls series I really sucked at Sekiro, and it made me feel as awful as DS1 did back when little babby Terminal played for the first time
[0:24:11] <Dexord> the hitboxes is DS3 is amazing compared to previous games
[0:24:15] <%KeynesianEconomist> Don't finish Dark Souls 3
[0:24:16] <$FrostMass22> Irythil
[0:24:17] <%irisillych> going from bloodborne to any souls game hurt, why aren't i FAST
[0:24:18] <jradmiral> Stranger Things fans: Go look at the shows Official Twitter page
[0:24:18] <%norgthefish> @SarahTsang 23 shots will not do it
[0:24:22] <%KeynesianEconomist> it is not worth it
[0:24:27] <%norgthefish> Hi @FromThe70s
[0:24:28] <$DreXKing_> what is this background music?

[0:24:49] <%heyello> Remnant was the first "souls-y" game I've played and I liked it
[0:25:01] <@SarahTsang> @norgthefish i get drunk after 1 shot of Jagerbombs/vodka shot.
[0:25:04] <+Dublinhawks> DS3 is mediocre, ashes of ariendel is meh, but the ringed city though.

[0:25:17] <Drk1Lucian> LUL I had to stop playing DS:PTDE cause hackers kept invading me with some dragon head and would just run after me breathing fire at me.

[0:27:03] <Realterminal> Oh yea SOuls is fucking ruined by twinks. My buddy and I tried playing through Remastered together and we couldn't get past Anor Londo because we'd just get insta gibbed
[0:27:23] <Dexord> @QuietteShy i heard that code vein has an infection of dragons dogma companions
[0:27:28] <zamzoph> thanks Kreygasm
[0:27:36] <+captainmakaveli> @SarahTsang what do you mean what xd
[0:27:39] <+ExclusivelyPlastic> is Pat still in the closet about liking anime?
[0:27:52] <DeathWatcher28> Holiday feast, too much food, I'm so full
[0:27:53] <%Hexagon_Angel> the assault and thorn veils are really cool but the combat just doesn't click with me
[0:27:54] <%HEAVY_IS_REPLY> They're having population problem. They need to solve it somehow.
[0:27:55] <SpookyBeef7> So very Japanese then?
[0:27:58] <+Nordguy> Speaking of anime, Has Patrick finished watching the kimetsu no yaiba?
[0:27:59] <Montiblanc> is it better than god eater 3 tho
[0:28:07] <%KeynesianEconomist> Dark Souls remaster went on sale a week ago i bought it for like $5
[0:28:08] <@SarahTsang> I really want to play Code Vein so i can do character customisation ><
[0:28:11] <%irisillych> water balloon booby
[0:28:11] <Realterminal> Anything that could be seen as lame he hate/loves ironically
[0:28:12] <%river0165> are you talking about Io?

[0:28:36] <l058> Even anthem?
[0:28:42] <Kutakai666> hi sarah
[0:28:47] <%irisillych> @SarahTsang i heard the char customization is DANK ugh.,.....
[0:29:07] <+bubbli97> don't tell me about the anime tiddies, i can see them, tell me about gameplay, boss design and levels
[0:29:14] <zamzoph> shame about the hair-clipping that gets in the way of making waifus, though
[0:29:17] <%Sealamancer> Sealamancer subscribed with Twitch Prime. 
[0:29:17] <Realterminal> Character customization reminds me of when I used to play THUG as a kid, and I'd make a skinny chick with the tiniest tube top ever. Because boobs.
[0:29:21] <@SarahTsang> @irisillych I played Code Vein in the Network Test, and customisation is greatttttttttttttttttt
[0:29:23] <$FrostMass22> Pat talks for a living
[0:29:24] <alpacnologia> i just tuned in and have *no* clue what that mini is supposed to be
[0:29:27] <Mathod> Character custimization?! It cant beeeee
[0:29:27] <@SarahTsang> it took me 2 hours @irisillych
[0:29:35] <%irisillych> i've never heard my name said so bad and i'm honored
[0:29:43] <@SarahTsang> Customer Customisation @Mathod
[0:30:12] <zamzoph> if you're not rocking heterochromia you're not doing anime right
[0:30:14] <@SarahTsang> Mish's character is literally just hats.

[0:30:47] <@SarahTsang> XD
[0:31:21] <%KeynesianEconomist> Oblivion is the best character creation ever
[0:31:28] <$FrostMass22> and in Dark Souls you're usually jerky
[0:31:28] <%irisillych> then ur dead
[0:31:34] <Partyvansama> yo everyone is code vein worth FULL PRICE in maple syrup bucks?

[0:35:32] <+wildfirexk1> The Dead Rising games kept your gear on during cutscenes. Nothing better than going through the game with a Servebot head.

[0:35:33] <%corrosivePaladin> I used to invade a lot in DS3 with just a loincloth and a heavy helmet. I got so much hatemail over it
[0:35:34] <sirelyphellyrian> boop ya noses

[0:36:25] <$FrostMass22> I was so proud when Sword finally beat Dark Souls
[0:36:26] <Ratmut> MyPancakeIsTheBestPancake!
[0:36:29] <@SarahTsang> @lolwatxdd what!
[0:36:42] <SpaceCatStation> for all the bad things that can be said about dark souls 2 I DID put a lot of time into the arena fights in that game
[0:36:51] <+Capta1n_H3nry> But DS2 has DUAL WIELDING
[0:36:56] <eanscrale> Tanimurush time!
[0:36:57] <+ASkeleton> Paige uses the biggest sword to compensate for her short sight
[0:36:59] <+Zxtole> Dark Souls 2 is great, it's just the worst souls game. It also has the best weapon system
[0:37:00] <zamzoph> DS2 DLC has the best AND worst parts!
[0:37:03] <+MrMirror> Dark souls 2 only DS I played
[0:37:07] <Tucker0603> it's good, but isn't fantastic
[0:37:18] <CandideCamera> people call it the worst despite playing it the most, hmmmm
[0:37:23] <Kutakai666> Monster Hunter World cutscenes are handled quite well. You can toggle off your characters head armor to show off their custom mug.
[0:37:23] <%KeynesianEconomist> Dark Souls 2 is just as good as Dark Souls 1
[0:37:24] <$FrostMass22> DS2 may have problems but at least you can cosplay as Kirito and dual wield
[0:37:26] <dukenux> sunken king?
[0:37:31] <+TheDoomedTraveler> I hear a lot of good things about DS2 pvp in comparison to the other games
[0:37:36] <Shimmying_skeleton> say what you will aboit DS2 BUT it has the best pvp in souls
[0:37:38] <@SarahTsang> I have DS2 coz it was on sale on Steam...but i haven't played it yet
[0:38:00] <zamzoph> The intentionally co-op areas of the DLC are TRASH
[0:38:11] <+legendfather_of_giants> YEAH
[0:38:12] <KTDelgado> I haven't played much of the ds series but the enemies are my favorite part
[0:38:14] <dukenux> LUL
[0:38:21] <%heyello> A shotgun to the face?
[0:38:23] <dukenux> same
[0:38:24] <@SarahTsang> (i got it)
[0:38:28] <+legendfather_of_giants> comin for ya Paige
[0:38:29] <%irisillych> kinda edgy
[0:38:32] <%irisillych> too esgy
[0:38:38] <Starchildtw> RIP Kurt
[0:38:48] <KTDelgado> I favorite was the queen who was so cursed that looking at paintings of her cursed you
[0:38:50] <jorniev> kurt kobain invaded pat so many times holy shit
[0:38:51] <dukenux> but the complete sandbag makes it funny
[0:39:08] <eanscrale> It had the most sluggish movement
[0:39:18] <larkaas254> my problem with dark souls 2 is the aggro range i swear enemies will follow you to the edge of the world
[0:39:34] <+ASkeleton> DS2 had the best PvP, I think we can all agree on that
[0:39:36] <+goose_attack_almanac> In Pat's DS 2 LP on the old channel, there was a guy who kept invading Pat and Woolie named Kurt Cobain.
[0:39:51] <$FrostMass22> Did Capra Demon have a delayed overhead?
[0:40:05] <+steampunksamsc> my opinion: DS1 is for people who like a great map DS2 is for people who like the time between bosses, and pvp, and DS3 is for people who love boss fights.
[0:40:12] <%irisillych> @goose_attack_almanac oooooh...I only remember lucky Ted and tarkus

[0:40:33] <dukenux> @goose_attack_almanac well then i dodnt get it
[0:40:40] <$FrostMass22> His thrust is still bad so long after release
[0:40:54] <@Lardcat> Starchildtw - You have won! Please speak up in chat!
[0:40:56] <Shimmying_skeleton> shock waves baby
[0:41:02] <@Roz_Lynd> @Starchildtw speak up in chat please!
[0:41:13] <%KeynesianEconomist> there was a stat that give people more I-frames
[0:41:14] <Starchildtw> I am so happy
[0:41:15] <jorniev> what was that horribly dificult boss from the dlc?
[0:41:24] <%KeynesianEconomist> invest in it
[0:41:24] <Starchildtw> That made my day!
[0:41:25] <+ASkeleton> DS2's main issue was that it was made by people who didn't really get why people enjoyed it so much
[0:41:40] <+MrMirror> Yeap D2 is my first ds game
[0:41:47] <zamzoph> The hardest game is the first
[0:41:48] <CandideCamera> I went out of my way to play DS1 first but 2 is still better
[0:41:50] <dukenux> Dont make eye contact with DS2 stans Kappa
[0:41:52] <Shimmying_skeleton> its the hardest cuz its thier first
[0:41:54] <Kutakai666> never played a souls game
[0:41:58] <%KeynesianEconomist> i the most difficulty with Dark souls 2 DLC bosses
[0:42:12] <+steampunksamsc> I feel like whatever dark souls game was your first is the hardest one
[0:42:18] <dukenux> yeah, but you also got better
[0:42:40] <SomeNEET> I beat dark souls once when it came out, is SotFS gonna slap my shit?
[0:42:46] <reedkage> HONK HONK HONK
[0:42:51] <eanscrale> The scrapping spear is something I never want to see return.
[0:42:51] <xeros720> world tendency is so silly
[0:42:52] <reedkage> also sup
[0:43:03] <zamzoph> I just ignored World Tendency in DeS and had a good time
[0:43:05] <xeros720> scrapping spear hype!
[0:43:06] <$FrostMass22> @someneet IMO, the areas are more difficult than the bosses
[0:43:09] <+ASkeleton> My first was DS1 and honestly I found DS2 to be the most bullshit
[0:43:34] <xeros720> the joke with demon souls is that the boss weapons are all the best
[0:43:38] <@SarahTsang> I watched playthroughs of Demon Souls
[0:43:49] <%Zedimonx5> Battle Tendency > World Tendency KappaRoss
[0:43:50] <$tonythetoad> Shy doesn't use "groundation/foundation" on her figurines?
[0:43:53] <eanscrale> sl1 really isn't that bad in vanilla.
[0:44:00] <reedkage> sarahhhhh
[0:44:33] <Kutakai666> yup
[0:44:35] <xeros720> THIS WAY ARISEN
[0:44:42] <dukenux> amazing that Dark Souls was so successful, it almost retroactively erased Demon's Souls from social consciousness.
[0:44:50] <+ASkeleton> I actually found Bloodborne to be the easiest souls game
[0:44:56] <$FrostMass22> Wolves hunt in packs, Arisen
[0:45:03] <ganzai> @tonythetoad People were painting minis for 50+ years without foundation so most people don't use those GW paints :)
[0:45:14] <xeros720> bloodborne probably has the easiest character builds
[0:45:16] <dukenux> same with RDR. what other games did that?

[0:45:37] <reedkage> 7 0 s
[0:45:43] <xeros720> oh yeah, no need to worry about armor really in bloodborne either
[0:45:45] <+ASkeleton> I couldn't parry for shit in DS but for some reason in bloodborne it just...clicked
[0:45:53] <dukenux> Bloodborne is faster afaik, so if you used to that tempo, you might find it easier.
[0:45:53] <Art_Nowhere> I recently got my friend into it and he keeps asking for help, but everytime i say no because i know how unfun it is if you don't do it yourself
[0:45:54] <%FromThe70s> reed dkdiaHey
[0:46:06] <$Cosmic_Warfighter> my friend let me play his dark souls 3, and wouldn't tell me shit as I struggled right next to him
[0:46:26] <+babyacid> Just do start chart
[0:46:42] <reedkage> did you un-rig the machine yet? people are starting to get suspicious f70sThink
[0:46:52] <+babyacid> thats it. plenty of stuff to do and things to get. just do star chart.
[0:47:17] <ginjais> first time I played DS3 we played 4-man co-op and I was just, booooored. We didn't go too far doing that tho, I'll go back and restart it whenever I finally play the earlier ones.
[0:47:30] <ginjais> the other 3 had all already beaten the game too lol
[0:47:38] <xeros720> "play games with blindfolds, it's the only way"
[0:48:01] <%croxeye> btw go play outer wilds
[0:48:22] <%KeynesianEconomist> still can't play bloodborne
[0:48:36] <+ChillTonic> "Time Stop"
[0:48:38] <+ASkeleton> I think the one boss that actually gave me grief in bloodborne was Laurence for some reason
[0:48:38] <%heyello> Service guarantees citizenship!
[0:48:43] <%TWolfJaeger> oh boy, Elite Dangerous with blindfolds, no reddit, no wiki
[0:48:45] <dukenux> [desire to know more intensifies]

[0:48:56] <+ASkeleton> No wait, it was the Shadows

[0:53:48] <Aruezi> total warhammer
[0:53:48] <zamzoph> straight up digital warhmmer will never happen
[0:53:50] <PretenTris> There's a game on Steam called Tabletop Simulator. It's a bit bootleg, but you can use it to play Warhammer.
[0:53:52] <SGrim> @zamzoph start with contrast paints. They teach super fast.
[0:53:57] <%FromThe70s> One more Prime sub and I'll match...
[0:54:09] <+babyacid> its the best
[0:54:10] <mtjrosa> the total war warhammer series is pretty baller
[0:54:11] <@SarahTsang> Listen to 70s, chat
[0:54:20] <%croxeye> get Tabletop simulator!
[0:54:22] <%FromThe70s> @samogon_ke5yn f70sK
[0:54:29] <Ratmut> 40k Space Marine was decent
[0:54:30] <Tucker0603> I WISH WE HAD A GOOD IMPERIAL KNIGHT GAME
[0:54:30] <%HammerOfWrath> I just prime subbed FeelsBadMan
[0:54:34] <%croxeye> you can play 40k in that
[0:54:36] <%SmugSamus> yo shy which warhammer is your favorite 40k or fantasy?
[0:54:42] <dukenux> i tried to get minifig painting once, it was cool, but didnt have time(nor money) to commit. still have a pack of painted miria giblins, tho!
[0:54:42] <+TaifuDragon> Tabletop Simulator has all the warhammer stuff loaded into it but customisation is low and systems are basic
[0:54:43] <zamzoph> @SGrim I don't think I really want contrast paints because I want more control. But one thing I'm stuck on is picking Citadel of Vallejo
[0:54:51] <dukenux> *get into
[0:54:52] <+CanasIsBack> total war is pretty good, space marine is ok, it is one of the biggest things they still haven't broken through is warhammer video games. dawn of war and 2 are oldies but good
[0:55:03] <@SarahTsang> I gifted DK all the Half Life games that was on sale on steam
[0:55:18] <SGrim> @Tucker0603 fuck it, go full Collegium Titanicus. Just huge mech war with Knights as ground troops.
[0:55:18] <%heyello> @zamzoph I can vouch for Vallejo, they're great

[1:03:20] <Mendin> do they (still?) make Hierophant biotitans?
[1:03:25] <%norgthefish> Have we talked about how DE kicked everyone into balls by saying "hey kiddos you will have an even harder time farming rare mods"
[1:03:33] <@SarahTsang> @worldend23 it's not shy, it's Roz talking
[1:03:35] <$That2D> jermaChomp

[1:03:37] <@Lardcat> Shy is *actually* physically mute. At one point she lost her voice and has chosen not to disclose the details. Please do not ask about or emphasize it further. Thank you. quiettLurks
[1:03:38] <+bakasheru> cake doogWhoa
[1:03:39] <+burnin8> the thing they're nerfing is damage boosting perks, which includes master of arms on recluse
[1:03:44] <+Aeoneth> It takes the highest Glory
[1:03:52] <worldend23> Ohhhh sorry guys~
[1:03:53] <+bakasheru> CAKE!
[1:04:00] <TarotNathers13th> It was worth it when it had ammo conservation but the quest is too fucking ballaching to do for it not it lost the one unique perk that was at all interesting.

[1:04:55] <KTDelgado> pat actively says cheat if you van
[1:05:01] <+Aeoneth> Yeah and adding glory loss cutoffs
[1:05:02] <Nope80808> What game is being disscussed?

[1:05:12] <zamzoph> oh gosh, Shy has such good handwriting
[1:05:13] <+masked_hero_lucky> That ain't toxic, toxic is screaming racial slurs in chat.
[1:05:14] <talisign> Its different when I cheat because I benefit from it
[1:05:16] <dukenux> lemon meringue?
[1:05:17] <@SarahTsang> Lemon...cheesecake?

[1:05:51] <%sshen> It looks like a candle
[1:05:51] <Mr_Strut> Most varieties of banana are extinct now.

[1:05:54] <BadassAlien> AVE DOMINUS NOX BROTHERS donutoPERATOR
[1:05:55] <dukenux> thats true
[1:05:57] <Mendin> nerfing chesa kubrow, nerfing the lootframes, but SMEETA STILL GETS IT'S BULLHOCKY
[1:05:58] <reedkage> one time I bit into a yellow cake thinking it was lemon but it was durian flavor
[1:05:59] <$FrostMass22> @masked_hero_lucky The most toxic is baiting people on the other team to put racial slurs in the chat, so they'll get banned
[1:06:01] <Nope80808> Bananas used to be like 90% seeds
[1:06:06] <%grandtour11> Artificial banana is based on an extinct breed of banana, and the Common banana we enjoy today is in danger of going extinct aswel
[1:06:12] <%irisillych> it was a fungus
[1:06:12] <Starchildtw> The seeds were bred out of bananas because they were unpalatable
[1:06:14] <PretenTris> You can still get that banana. It's just very expensive.
[1:06:20] <%heyello> Patented flavours
[1:06:23] <Mr_Strut> Because that is the only memory we have left of that banana!

[1:06:29] <Mr_Strut> Show some respect for the dead!
[1:06:32] <dukenux> to preserve the taste?
[1:06:34] <+TaifuDragon> @QuietteShy that wasn't a millenia ago, that was in the 1950s
[1:06:40] <zwhitekz> banana have many flavor ?
[1:06:43] <%heyello> Bananas are very GMO
[1:06:47] <+masked_hero_lucky> Did you know corn can't grow in the wild? It requires human interaction.
[1:06:53] <$FrostMass22> Bananas were genetically engineered via using artificial selection
[1:06:56] <+CanasIsBack> it's not extinct, it's just commercially unviable, we now use the cavendish which is also under attack by fungi
[1:06:57] <Kutakai666> go figure
[1:07:04] <Mendin> I refuse, the Chesa has been robbed for too long
[1:07:05] <zamzoph> agriculture is inherently GMO
[1:07:06] <hoplipop> that is selective breeding and have nothing to do with genetic enginiring
[1:07:13] <dukenux> You get like one, maybe two varietes of a banana in Europe.
[1:07:20] <%norgthefish> No
[1:07:20] <+burnin8> you have never eaten a "natural" food. every single food humanity has eaten for the last few centuries has been genetically engineered
[1:07:21] <+CanasIsBack> but they are duplicated by shoots
[1:07:21] <imnotLua> heyo @QuietteShy have a nice stream!
[1:07:22] <MiloChristiansen> Not true!
[1:07:24] <Mr_Strut> Corn was designed by humans
[1:07:24] <%TheAngryChicken52> Corn was made by the Native American
[1:07:28] <KTDelgado> the corn we eat is GMO
[1:07:30] <theSLiKbandit> oh nooo
[1:07:31] <talisign> Undomesticated corn is like the size of a pencil.
[1:07:34] <Mr_Strut> Originally it was just grass
[1:07:34] <%sourigoth> pat doing the good talking
[1:07:36] <%grandtour11> Pats having a sqwint
[1:07:40] <%Razputin217> Again?!
[1:07:41] <+Coyotebd> Why is there a channel with this many views that I've never seen.
[1:07:41] <ShichiNoBushi> Pat is in a persistent state of stroke.
[1:07:45] <+masked_hero_lucky> ***
[1:07:46] <MiloChristiansen> You can get "volunteer" corn all over the place if you spill some.
[1:07:46] <$FrostMass22> Pat has a stroke at least twice each time he streams
[1:07:47] <+masked_hero_lucky> Citation
[1:07:47] <KTDelgado> wild corn is the non gmo version
[1:07:49] <+bakasheru> yes, corn does not grow in the wild, wild corn looks like grain
[1:07:49] <%FromThe70s> fbzFail
[1:07:49] <xeros720> so baby corn is actually "real corn"
[1:07:50] <%TheAngryChicken52> Lemons also aren't natural, so when life doesn't give you lemons, you make them yourelf
[1:07:54] <+CanasIsBack> yeah undomesticated corn is not very large at all
[1:07:59] <%norgthefish> Some veggies and fruits are SOO selected to the point that they can no longer spread by themself
[1:08:07] <talisign> Cows actually are bred to be too stupid to survive
[1:08:15] <Mendin> turn off the gas leak Pat, or tell us about the bumblebees
[1:08:16] <+bakasheru> ... wild corn is uneatable
[1:08:26] <%heyello> They grow watermelons in a box to make them square
[1:08:28] <ShichiNoBushi> Just grow in a box.
[1:08:31] <%irisillych> get pat to remember.....the fat cow
[1:08:32] <$Midashu> melons take the shape of their container
[1:08:36] <%heyello> They can do tonnes of shapes
[1:08:41] <KTDelgado> you put them in a plastic mold and it shapes them
[1:08:42] <ShichiNoBushi> Also packing.
[1:08:43] <Kutakai666> yup
[1:08:43] <eanscrale> It's novelty, they don't taste good
[1:08:48] <$FrostMass22> Pat knows all about square watermelons because he loves cubes
[1:08:48] <DeadpanSoupcan> better for packing
[1:08:50] <%heyello> There's literally buddha shaped pears you can buy
[1:08:50] <talisign> Easier storage, too
[1:08:50] <xeros720> yeah, don't do that to organisms
[1:08:51] <MiloChristiansen> @talisign If you belive that you have never seen what real cows are like.

[1:10:44] <+bakasheru> watermelon with salt is pretty dope
[1:10:50] <talisign> Its like a pinata, but with fruit
[1:10:51] <lavatein00> no one do it in real life LUL
[1:10:52] <pectusumbra> it's a thing you see a lot, so it's an actual jp thing
[1:10:56] <eanscrale> It's not .
[1:10:57] <%RavenInRain> What is the name again?
[1:10:57] <theSLiKbandit> AMV Hell is a classic
[1:10:59] <%sourigoth> asumango dayo the originator of the waifu term
[1:11:00] <Pappajimbo> here is what wiki says:In domesticated wheat, grains are larger, and the seeds (inside the spikelets) remain attached to the ear by a toughened rachis during harvesting.[16] In wild strains, a more fragile rachis allows the ear to easily shatter and disperse the spikelets.[17]
[1:11:01] <JetpackMcQuack> osugondadayo
[1:11:01] <zamzoph> Fire Emblem Heroes references beach watermelons
[1:11:08] <+masked_hero_lucky> Go look up AMV Hell 0 Kappa
[1:11:10] <ShichiNoBushi> Mostly cringe.
[1:11:11] <xeros720> i'd watch amv hell, but then i'd remember all the other stuff i did in high school and i'm terrified of that

[1:24:07] <%Darkmega97> just jam cotton in your nose to emulate it
[1:24:26] <Kutakai666> eww?
[1:24:29] <Ratmut> DMC was a great game
[1:24:36] <Ratmut> and the story was trash-tier garbage
[1:24:42] <Nope80808> ds4? I don't think dark souls already breaking lore can take any more hits
[1:24:48] <NoctisxMog> I'd like dmC if was something else
[1:24:58] <dukenux> But demon baby sniper abortion? one of the peaks of the history of gaming?
[1:25:04] <%Darkmega97> How much of not a gay cowboy is Dante?
[1:25:06] <NoctisxMog> I hated the weapon switching
[1:25:11] <SomeNEET> dmc's gameplay was okay after they took the community mods and included them in the definitive edition
[1:25:23] <%sshen> Hit or miss doesnt really compare to sniper rifle abortions in DMC DMC
[1:25:24] <Ratmut> And PC never got that rooD
[1:25:26] <Bishesh> reboot is a good game but a bad dmc
[1:25:29] <ginjais> and also Vergil design changes

[1:25:43] <SomeNEET> wasn't the STYLE SYSTEM missing from the original version? LUL
[1:25:57] <dukenux> Vergil design change included: taking his fedora off

[1:28:22] <xeros720> ^
[1:28:28] <ginjais> mainline DMC may not put much weight on its story stuff but it maintains both thematic consistency and great characterisation in basically every single game
[1:28:34] <Fujiwara_92> Donte is great
[1:28:57] <CaptainFuzzkill> Has Shy dipped her paintbrush in her cappuccino yet?
[1:29:04] <Kutakai666> hah

[1:29:12] <Rixtah> I hope so
[1:29:13] <Mr_Strut> Donte was here. Mundus is a loser!
[1:29:25] <SomeNEET> In the end DMC will always be forgiven since it gave us Senor Donte and his amazing moustache
[1:29:28] <@SarahTsang> @CaptainFuzzkill no
[1:29:32] <Rixtah> Guess she's painting with cappuccino.
[1:29:36] <dukenux> shouldve write "dicce and balls*

[1:31:40] <Nope80808> all Capcom games have high sexual tension with characters that never have it.

[1:32:07] <%irisillych> only the cool rebel teens smoked
[1:32:10] <Rixtah> Constanine's smoking is kinda the story. LUL
[1:32:14] <%Them00n> Vaping never looked cool but people still do it.
[1:32:19] <CaptainFuzzkill> @SarahTsang One day....
[1:32:21] <dukenux> *points to Spike Spiegel*
[1:32:23] <ShichiNoBushi> *takes a long drag* COUGH-COUGH-SPUTTER-SPUTTER
[1:32:29] <%Mathod> my brain does tingle hapilly when I hold something ala a cigarett
[1:32:31] <samogon_ke5yn> smoking = impotence
[1:32:34] <%irisillych> 4 kinda is relaxing
[1:32:37] <%Mathod> never got smoking thankfullt
[1:32:41] <zamzoph> @Ixiah I bet Pat'll mention Ork WAAAGH! SMOrc
[1:32:41] <dukenux> thats true
[1:32:47] <ShichiNoBushi> It's all because of oral fixation.
[1:32:48] <+bakasheru> vaping is cheaper >_>
[1:32:50] <@SarahTsang> i used to smoke when i was drunk back in my uni days
[1:32:52] <zwhitekz> anything that not air doesnt go with human lung
[1:32:52] <SpookyBeef7> Vaping makes you look like a douchebag.
[1:33:12] <%Nikit0sBarb0s> Smoking nowadays is condiered to be edgy, cringeworthy edgy
[1:33:13] <+Ixiah> Pat wpuld workship Nurgel apatSmug
[1:33:15] <etalmeta> @TheDoomedTraveler capcom pushed for team ninja to make Dante as different as possible. I don't believe any specific instructions were given
[1:33:15] <@SarahTsang> but then i tried smoking when i was sober and it was disgusting...so haven't smoked since then
[1:33:18] <Morphjin74129> @SarahTsang I still do LUL
[1:33:20] <xeros720> vaping still stinks and it took too long for my local government to start ticketing people who did it indoors
[1:33:21] <$FrostMass22> The problem was bootleg vape cartridges
[1:33:21] <ShichiNoBushi> Just design a vape that looks like a classy pipe.
[1:33:22] <%FromThe70s> Vaping got me off regular cigs
[1:33:25] <dukenux> Adults?
[1:33:31] <samogon_ke5yn> but plump in moderation can
[1:33:35] <%irisillych> I think I read something about nicotine calming down people with ADHD, making it easier to focus. smoke breaks also helped with that too.
[1:33:45] <%irisillych> vapes were totally sold to kids because it's fuckin CANDY
[1:33:49] <roundaboutrevengeance> There is cotton candy vodka
[1:33:51] <$Midashu> the kids of yesterday are adults now
[1:33:59] <%Taverius> @Roz_Lynd smoking saved my grandpa's life, one day during wwii he felt like buying cigarettes on the way to a partisan meeting and in the meanwhile the nazi executed all his friends ...
[1:34:02] <theSLiKbandit> ooooh, I don't think I'd be able to handle Capn' Crunch today
[1:34:05] <%Darkmega97> captain crunch flavored vape
[1:34:06] <dukenux> Vaping is still moderately better than smoking, if only because it eliminates second hand
[1:34:08] <%irisillych> it's not harmful because it's not cigarettes!
[1:34:08] <Nope80808> the flavor of vape pens being diverse is what makes it popular.
[1:34:11] <%Sealamancer> Captain crunch is just glass in sugar form
[1:34:16] <%heyello> Part of the anger behind the vaping legislation is the fact that it proves legislation can be passed on issues but not on what matters most.
[1:34:18] <%Mathod> We are the grumpy old people of tommorow
[1:34:19] <ginjais> if someone vapes their bullshit on you it's what I iassume walking into a gummy bear factory smells like. Just, the most manufactured, kinda gross fruit-flavour smell imaginable.
[1:34:24] <PerSohn> @SarahTsang I used to do the same
[1:34:27] <zwhitekz> Safe rooKek sure keep telling urself that
[1:34:37] <Nope80808> people age when they get older
[1:34:41] <ShichiNoBushi> Safer, maybe. But that does not mean it's safe.
[1:34:44] <Tucker0603> it's actually worse
[1:34:44] <nejurnia> holy fuck its actually pat i love you
[1:34:55] <$Midashu> LUL
[1:34:55] <ginjais> damn it Pat
[1:34:59] <dukenux> LUL
[1:35:02] <$FrostMass22> the issue is that vaping is not as well understood as cigarettes I assume

[1:35:30] <Psyramics> it should feel like shit to smoke it
[1:35:31] <%irisillych> second hand smoke
[1:35:34] <+justin_cray> then black market cigs will rule

[1:35:52] <%Darkmega97> Pat no? Pat yes!
[1:35:58] <KosOrSomeSayKosm_> can't smoke if a single cigarette kills you *guy with the finger*
[1:36:08] <%irisillych> the secondhand smoke!!

[1:36:38] <+bakasheru> most studies for vaping are terrible from what I have seen.
[1:36:39] <+CanasIsBack> honestly all you would need to do is put the bitterants they put into compressed air, people would drop that shit a ton, but they won't do it because they make money off of it, the reason why they banned fruit flavors is because they are trying to shut out competition
[1:36:42] <starotter70> LUL
[1:36:43] <dukenux> you can take the some approach to fuel! instant elimination of non electric cars
[1:36:43] <Morphjin74129> 100% valid point LUL
[1:36:45] <ShichiNoBushi> Why hasn't anyone make a vape in the shape of a pipe?
[1:36:48] <reedkage> doesnt 70s use a vape pen? f70sThink
[1:36:50] <theSLiKbandit> Yup, let's make fun of all the folks looking to quit using these devices. They can handle it, right?
[1:36:51] <WackyXmand> I heard that if you smoke from a huge bong will kill you in a week of smoking cause of the amount of nicotine your ingesting
[1:36:51] <Tucker0603> PAT IS ACTUALLY RIGHT
[1:36:54] <$FrostMass22> Pat: Pro science, anti child

[1:37:10] <%irisillych> 70s is a dad. dads can vape.
[1:37:10] <%heyello> Black market fluids
[1:37:11] <%sshen> Vape pens also exploded too
[1:37:12] <%Taverius> Vitamin E contaminated juice
[1:37:15] <%FromThe70s> 6. vs how many millions of lung cancer
[1:37:16] <dukenux> someone mightve died from exploding vape pen
[1:37:17] <+justin_cray> vapes are like hotbeds for bacteria
[1:37:27] <%AncelDeLambert> this shit's on too early for a night owl on the west coast like me look at this I don't even have coffee yet
[1:37:28] <%irisillych> people recently died of vapes
[1:37:28] <%grandtour11> Freind of mine started vaping and said "i did all the research its harmless" a few years ago, I dont know how hes doing now but i bet hes Ill
[1:37:28] <+FlakeyJunk> Elon gonna start a vape company on Mars.
[1:37:28] <%Them00n> Those were skeevy chinese black market stuff.
[1:37:29] <Kutakai666> coughing up blood? yikes
[1:37:30] <$FrostMass22> It's probably bootleg stuff
[1:37:30] <%Mathod> Vaping OP, Plz nerf
[1:37:36] <Nope80808> nothing you smoke at all is healthy just varied levels of dangerous
[1:37:37] <%irisillych> like 9 so far
[1:37:40] <%heyello> @sshen That's just due to shitty batteries, same reason the S7 exploded
[1:37:44] <Caidezes> Don't huff any kind of fumes, kids. It'll kill you eventually.
[1:37:46] <%AncelDeLambert> 1111111111111
[1:37:48] <ShichiNoBushi> I've also heard of the vapes exploding when they get too hot.
[1:37:48] <SpookyBeef7> Six people have died from vaping this year in the US. Now the government is rushing to ban them and ignoring the mass murders from assault rifles that occur every day.
[1:37:49] <+justin_cray> no dude, its wet and always in your mouth and hand = bacteria
[1:37:55] <%FromThe70s> I cant even begin to explain how wrong that is
[1:37:56] <Cute_Arsonist> It was about oil based stuff, oil turns to vape and to oil inside the lungs
[1:37:57] <xeros720> so it was an overdose?
[1:38:05] <PauliusMaximus> people have also had issues with liquid pooling in their lungs
[1:38:07] <%FromThe70s> truth
[1:38:08] <$SushiMagician> the only thing I smoke is food
[1:38:10] <%irisillych> it was the chems in the vape
[1:38:13] <%grandtour11> Yes
[1:38:15] <Spydurman> but mah skittles flavored vape
[1:38:16] <+Nordguy> black market weed liquid is what was the big issue
[1:38:19] <%sshen> What if I smoke a fish or meat
[1:38:21] <+bakasheru> overdose on vaping is pretty hard
[1:38:24] <+oAlec687> It's stupid people using chinese knockoff shit
[1:38:31] <dukenux> smoke in your lungs is never good
[1:38:31] <%grandtour11> @SushiMagician Smoked fish
[1:38:34] <%Taverius> Blaze, it was Vitamin E contamination in illegal thc juice
[1:38:45] <+FlakeyJunk> it's almost like lungs are not designed for things spicier than air
[1:38:46] <%irisillych> the coal miner black lung
[1:38:46] <%FromThe70s> If you dont smoke, fucking dont start. Period. Vaping or otherwise.
[1:38:47] <%Them00n> That's why I butt chug all alcohol so it can't accidentally get in my lungs.
[1:38:48] <dukenux> it can be LESS BAD, but thats it
[1:38:48] <%heyello> Not paper ones, with filters!
[1:38:52] <$SushiMagician> what if I smoke a breathalyzer
[1:38:57] <Rixtah> Can I vape medicals? I got asthma. Is that okey?
[1:38:59] <%thematloch1> It was vitamin c vaporization in a thx pod from the black market in India
[1:38:59] <+jeancly> FUN FACT !!! ( not really ) do you know that what gives you cancer in cigarettes is the same thing that is on your BBQ when you burn the meat ? or in general on burned food. COOK YOUR STUFF NICELY PEOPLE !! do not eat burned stuff
[1:39:06] <CaptainFuzzkill> I should get one of those for when I spray models.
[1:39:12] <dukenux> ???
[1:39:23] <+bubbli97> !uptime
[1:39:25] <%Them00n> It was black market weed vape stuff.
[1:39:26] <%Taverius> I didnt even know vitamin e was an issue
[1:39:26] <%irisillych> don't be me and use Mr Super Clear on your minifigs with no care
[1:39:31] <amhaney1989> people speculating about things they have no actual experience or knowledge about isn't something that's worth anyone's time. spreading misinformation is unhelpful
[1:39:42] <%irisillych> Roz, bby....you might be too obscure with that.....
[1:39:43] <%Taverius> but hey, dont vape black market shite xD
[1:39:44] <%AncelDeLambert> Don't do drugs kids, unless you want to
[1:39:45] <+bakasheru> high concentrations of nicotine makes you throw up and get nauseous.
[1:39:47] <%Mathod> Hey kids, dont smoke, spend money on lootboxes instead
[1:39:47] <Rixtah> Was a joke. LUL
[1:39:52] <%irisillych> but I remember that
[1:39:54] <Spydurman> LUL
[1:39:56] <talisign> More important than your health, smoking and vaping is expensive as hell
[1:39:57] <%norgthefish> Only not cool kids smoke
[1:39:58] <+Trtickster> The vapor also condenses in your lungs, leading to horrible lung infections, and it's also possible to drown from excessive vaping
[1:39:59] <@SarahTsang> Smoke lootboxes @Mathod
[1:40:02] <Spydurman> joke's dead now Pat

[1:41:58] <rtvzr> Who are in the stream? MGL, DK, Pat, Shy, Roz?

[1:43:01] <PerSohn> For a long time, Redbull was forbiden in France
[1:43:36] <IndoorSitup> Energy drinks should be banned, imo

[1:45:20] <dukenux> i knew a guy in HS who chugged on energy drinks every break. he stopped when he got shits from it

[1:46:36] <aeonicvector> How many breads have i eated to get b12 tho
[1:46:39] <+skizzuto> You also have large stores of B12 in your body, so it takes years of not having any in your diet to become deficient
[1:46:40] <%travakh> yea
[1:46:41] <$FrostMass22> Woolie would love this stream
[1:46:43] <IndoorSitup> My intense hatred of energy drinks probably stems from that one time I had the GENIUS idea to mix coffee and Red Bull. Holy shit, never again.
[1:46:47] <+jeancly> unless you are a vegan. then you are stupid and you are killing yourself by not having an intake of b12
[1:46:51] <Rixtah> Is B12 not this Hip Hop group? Kappa

[1:47:17] <%Arturiafayth> Blaze, isn't that because B12 is best consumed from meat? :P
[1:47:18] <Starchildtw> The b12 found in non vegan food is fed ass supplements to the animals you know.

[1:50:56] <%KeynesianEconomist> have you heard of Machine guns when invading
[1:51:05] <KosOrSomeSayKosm_> it'll happen if you wait long enough
[1:51:14] <%Them00n> Crush your opponent but do so politely if possible.
[1:51:16] <dukenux> maybe she likes coffee with paint tinner, you dont know
[1:51:17] <%AncelDeLambert> I HATE pvp because my internet is ass and also fuck you for invading me
[1:51:18] <+CanasIsBack> drinking your paint is like a rite of passage
[1:51:18] <IndoorSitup> IS IT A SANIC REFERENCE?
[1:51:20] <Tucker0603> I got 4 in one burst
[1:51:28] <%sshen> Play to win unless you have bad connection then pat will beat your ass
[1:51:30] <+CanasIsBack> seriously

[1:52:32] <xxterminatorviixx> It‚Äôs for new light player
[1:52:34] <%AncelDeLambert> the problem I have with Dark Souls pvp is that there's no real skill tiers, so you can't actually get good practice in. You're either stomping some noob or getting stomped, no inbetween.
[1:52:44] <alrobot2014> you can preload it now
[1:52:45] <ginjais> it's also available for pre-load
[1:52:53] <Nope80808> Im glad they ditched activision
[1:52:54] <%sshen> Servers down all day tomorrow, scrap your sparrows and ships today for bright dust
[1:52:54] <xeros720> "free to start" like nintendo
[1:52:56] <%FromThe70s> Im gonna try to play free forever
[1:53:00] <%irisillych> I'd wanna play destiny more if the base wasn't 80g mN
[1:53:03] <xinexes> free to enter
[1:53:08] <%KeynesianEconomist> you only pay for forsaken and shadow keep
[1:53:08] <pepegakuchihig> i wanna kill myself

[1:53:33] <%irisillych> kids prefer the term "mini-buys"
[1:53:33] <IndoorSitup> Woolie is such a sweet summer child.
[1:53:38] <%croxeye> wars*
[1:53:42] <+TheRiceHatSamurai> Guild Wars 2 does do the same thing. Base game and first expansion is now free to play.
[1:53:42] <dukenux> Buy 2 Pay
[1:53:42] <%Darkmega97> Buy to play. What an innovative concept
[1:53:56] <%sshen> It went in the trash
[1:54:01] <talisign> @IndoorSitup He killed that guy, though
[1:54:07] <Tucker0603> it's ok, but the horizontal progression gets boring
[1:54:14] <IndoorSitup> God, the hype machine for Guild Wars 2 was so fucken ridiculous.
[1:54:26] <+Darknness60> uuuuh sexy nagash?
[1:54:38] <zamzoph> A Char?!
[1:54:46] <+Arragon5xpwm> Sometimes I forget that Shy is mute because I think "boah, you are talking too much" only then to realize that it's DK's voice I'm annoyed of
[1:54:49] <%sshen> DCUO is on 30+ xpacs
[1:54:52] <IndoorSitup> I do.
[1:54:57] <%croxeye> radiant quests from guild wars 2 is an amazing concept that more mmos need to steal
[1:54:58] <ginjais> I remember Angry Joe's, that's all tho
[1:55:05] <%FromThe70s> Knights of the Old Republic
[1:55:05] <@MGlBlaze> Charr; huge millitaristic cat people

[1:55:32] <+hheinrichh> flaming
[1:55:35] <+TheRiceHatSamurai> I mean, the game in its current state isn't terribad. Path of Fire is definitely a better expansion than Heart of Thorns.
[1:55:35] <+Grayhammatter> gottem
[1:55:35] <xeros720> ding dong bannu
[1:55:37] <%Darkmega97> DK the salty streamer man Kappa
[1:55:42] <%irisillych> dk's sleepy voice is nice. his awake voice is a lil....annoyin.
[1:55:44] <%FromThe70s> GW2 was good until the first expac
[1:55:51] <IndoorSitup> Guild Wars 2 was okay.
[1:55:54] <Whypper> he could whisper the cringiest things into my ear
[1:55:54] <Bagladder> DK I love you, but I think I might be the only one
[1:55:58] <+bakasheru> *scrub lord* doogLewd
[1:56:07] <Tucker0603> Firebrand, in path of fire is fucking awesome
[1:56:10] <%heyello> You know what I'm sad is dying? Planetside 2!
[1:56:13] <+TheRiceHatSamurai> They fixed all that tbh..
[1:56:21] <+TheRiceHatSamurai> New living world just came out last week.
[1:56:23] <%FromThe70s> Well and the expansion was all bouncy castle grinding, it was stupid
[1:56:28] <%norgthefish> They lived long enough to become a villan
[1:56:30] <IndoorSitup> The most fun I had with Guild Wars 2 was all the platforming sections.
[1:56:32] <%norgthefish> JUST LIKE WARFRAME
[1:56:35] <%irisillych> I'm sad ARMs is dying
[1:56:47] <%AceFireBlaze> AceFireBlaze subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 10 months! woo!
[1:56:50] <Zeynelse> Just like Bart ' u '
[1:56:54] <%irisillych> yes.........
[1:56:55] <dukenux> the Nintendo game?
[1:57:02] <%irisillych> it was pretty fun
[1:57:18] <Tucker0603> that girl with the booty is hot
[1:57:21] <%irisillych> could've had MORE
[1:57:28] <Bagladder> needed an Arms character in smash
[1:57:33] <IndoorSitup> ARMS was good but was way too slow paced for it to be fun in long bursts to watch and play
[1:57:35] <%irisillych> she is
[1:57:43] <dukenux> i... agree
[1:57:43] <%Darkmega97> Splatoon 2 is crap because it's not called Splatwoon
[1:57:52] <%Mathod> When's bayo3? :(
[1:57:53] <Rixtah> needed an Arms character TO smash
[1:57:57] <%heyello> Anyone remember EQ Next?
[1:57:58] <zamzoph> D:
[1:57:58] <Ratmut> One of them is an assist trophy as well
[1:58:00] <%grandtour11> Shlongtop is fine
[1:58:02] <%KeynesianEconomist> Today is the last day to play Destiny 2 until Tuesday.
[1:58:03] <+Grayhammatter> oof
[1:58:03] <%travakh> So who here is gonna watch the Jorker movie quiettSmug
[1:58:04] <+skizzuto> Spla2n
[1:58:08] <%sshen> I hope the digimon games sell well on switch and steam
[1:58:08] <+bakasheru> <3
[1:58:11] <Mr_Strut> How dare you flip the bird to lord zed?
[1:58:14] <Fujiwara_92> they need an Undertale character on smash Kappa
[1:58:20] <dukenux> 2platoon
[1:58:30] <CaptainFuzzkill> tppowerZedd tppowerZedd tppowerZedd
[1:58:31] <%KeynesianEconomist> everyone keeps saying my name wrong
[1:58:36] <bomi1995> lord zedd is so cool tho
[1:58:38] <IndoorSitup> That's weird.
[1:58:38] <%AncelDeLambert> is it because he's AWESOME, Shy?
[1:58:42] <%KeynesianEconomist> gotta hit up xur
[1:58:50] <KosOrSomeSayKosm_> talking about inaccessible...*cough* steam
[1:59:12] <%irisillych> 79.1 gigs.......
[1:59:17] <%croxeye> man I still love taken armaments for Gambit LOLOL
[1:59:20] <%Mathod> Tfw you want to play both Warframe and Destiny but you dont have time for both BibleThump
[1:59:22] <IndoorSitup> I would log back in but that would mean clearing up space on my console and waiting for that shit to download so fuck that
[1:59:25] <%norgthefish> oopsie
[1:59:25] <zwhitekz> but classic WoW though Kapp
[1:59:33] <dukenux> remember that you can refund some games on Epic store, and then still play them
[1:59:45] <%sshen> Dont forget dismantling your exotic ships and ghosts for bright dust and rebuy them with legendary shards instead
[1:59:53] <ginjais> I won't be jumping straight back in to D2 ASAP so idm the preload lol
[2:00:16] <rtvzr> The real problem is that you have to read the stream and write the stream to the same disk. It isn't usually the CPU anymore
[2:00:21] <%KeynesianEconomist> Have you enabled CROSS SAVE?
[2:00:24] <%croxeye> yes dismantle all your eververse shit

[2:00:34] <psychovaati721> What is the best Warhammer game? (In your opinion?
[2:00:39] <%Darkmega97> Pat will you do a 24h stream?
[2:00:51] <Tucker0603> I have an exam Thursday, so....yeah...
[2:00:59] <%FlakeyJunk> is Shy using those new "one-thick-coat" abomination paints?
[2:01:06] <%croxeye> I will be doing day1 raid with my clan
[2:01:10] <xeros720> hell yeah, anything but
[2:01:18] <%Darkmega97> best Warhammer game is Space Marine
[2:01:19] <pectusumbra> I approve!
[2:01:25] <Golem100> ShadowWeak LUL Some people are in for a big surprise that weren't around during D2 year 1 ;)
[2:01:30] <IndoorSitup> So guys, Titan, Hunter, or Warlock?
[2:01:43] <IndoorSitup> Titan main here.
[2:01:45] <%irisillych> hey guys how about anthem
[2:01:50] <Nope80808> Its a soft reboot
[2:01:50] <pectusumbra> okay, so now idiot question: what faction is Shy painting
[2:01:59] <dukenux> no
[2:01:59] <Nope80808> Ew
[2:02:08] <+kabuhiro> the moon is going to be super crowded
[2:02:09] <Rixtah> @Darkmega97 What about Warhammer 40K Fire Fighter? Kappa
[2:02:09] <%croxeye> I'm going to try and stream it if my PC wants too
[2:02:13] <%AncelDeLambert> correct answer
[2:02:15] <+Grayhammatter> owch
[2:02:15] <dukenux> Eldar?
[2:02:17] <%travakh> rattle me bones
[2:02:20] <xeros720> i'm sure gonna miss having a punching bag
[2:02:25] <+commanderclaw> She's painting Arkhan the Black
[2:02:25] <%Mathod> The Bone Lords
[2:02:26] <IndoorSitup> I feel so fucking bad for the devs working on Anthem.
[2:02:26] <%AncelDeLambert> HEY GUYS YOU READY FOR THE DEATH OF BIOWARE?
[2:02:28] <SGrim> Boner Lords?
[2:02:29] <rtvzr> Shy makes skelmo(?) proud!
[2:02:30] <Jusaboiii> Watching Warhammer painting just makes me more anxious to start painting my GSC... just arrive already dammit
[2:02:30] <xeros720> we seriously had fallout 76, then anthem
[2:02:32] <%Them00n> tbh I'll give Anthem props just for hanging on this long.
[2:02:33] <pectusumbra> ahhhh, got ya. I only know a bit of 40K, but I can always approve of undead
[2:02:33] <%irisillych> skeleton warriors
[2:02:34] <%Mathod> Perfect for the Spookening
[2:02:36] <%grandtour11> Stop DK
[2:02:39] <%Darkmega97> Anthem isn't dead, it's just comatose.. and not breathing... and without a pulse
[2:02:41] <%heyello> Sounds like Heresy to me
[2:02:44] <zk_nails> recently someone brought u[ Anthem and it took me an actual minute to recall what that even was
[2:02:44] <dukenux> F
[2:02:47] <Fujiwara_92> skeleton warriors
[2:02:54] <%sshen> They died years ago.
[2:02:55] <dukenux> no please cintinue Pat
[2:02:55] <Mr_Strut> Bioware was dead the day EA bought them.
[2:02:55] <SGrim> P.s. It's legions of sacrament. Subset of Nagash's death alliance. SeemsGood
[2:02:56] <IndoorSitup> S E C R E T S
[2:02:56] <xeros720> blessed pat
[2:02:57] <Nope80808> Dragons Age 4 is lookin to be disaterous
[2:03:03] <%AncelDeLambert> Looks like Power Rangers to me
[2:03:05] <dukenux> unless you save it for the podcast
[2:03:06] <%Mathod> Dragon Age will save them guys Kappa
[2:03:06] <$FrostMass22> I can't wait for the death of Bioware
[2:03:09] <psychovaati721> Overwatch comes to Switch in October, thoughts?
[2:03:09] <+Grayhammatter> bioware is done
[2:03:09] <xeros720> hey guys, pillars of eternity is real good
[2:03:12] <%AncelDeLambert> woot, podcast teaser
[2:03:19] <%FlakeyJunk> This is making me very anxious about the goblins I'm not currently painting.
[2:03:19] <%vectorless_peon> BEEN READY FOR BIOWARE TP DIE SINCE ME #
[2:03:21] <Fujiwara_92> man, I was waiting big for DA4BibleThump
[2:03:26] <Fujiwara_92> BibleThump
[2:03:28] <%croxeye> hey Pat talk about the Three B's
[2:03:29] <pectusumbra> I don't expect they will get the chance at this point
[2:03:31] <%irisillych> prediction: pat knows peeps and knows
[2:03:33] <$Midashu> Death of Bioware after Dragon Age 4.
[2:03:33] <%Mathod> *puts on cap*
[2:03:33] <$FrostMass22> Dragon Age 4 needs to be the Wild Hunt of Bioware
[2:03:34] <Deavorn> mitzFOIL
[2:03:34] <+didyouthinkofthis> TheIlluminati
[2:03:36] <zamzoph> I LOVE IT TheIlluminati TheIlluminati TheIlluminati
[2:03:38] <+Redbishop_> woopsCult
[2:03:42] <%sshen> Corpse of bioware is fucked but real bioware died after mass effect 2
[2:03:42] <+Engwithan_Elder_God> Who takes the tinfoil off?
[2:03:44] <+MikoNoPants> BIOWARE died when it let itself go down Frostbite street
[2:03:47] <dukenux> Jade Empire 2 never
[2:03:50] <Nope80808> Roz's kaspersky theory corner
[2:03:50] <JacktheSleeper42> I really hope the rumour DA4 is gonna be a live service game is not true.
[2:03:52] <IndoorSitup> Guys, play Greedfall. It's a good enough Bioware game replacement.
[2:03:53] <%FlakeyJunk> cease your investigations.
[2:03:55] <zamzoph> an inside job?!
[2:04:01] <dukenux> TheIlluminati TheIlluminati TheIlluminati
[2:04:02] <Kutakai666> oh boy
[2:04:03] <zwhitekz> EA = bad rooDerp
[2:04:05] <TREEMAN9999> TheIlluminati
[2:04:06] <+Turtle_Senpai> So is that faction just the undead cult of Santa?
[2:04:08] <bluebiscuit94> Man your painting station is way cleaner than mine, and better ordered too
[2:04:18] <Golem100> And yet Anthem still had better flying controls than Archwing, that the rest of the game was dogsh*t was unfortunate, if predictable. Still, rolll on Archwing 2.0 ;)
[2:04:21] <%KeynesianEconomist> Anthem was in development for 7 years
[2:04:21] <+MikoNoPants> because Frostbite is a horrible engine an doesn't optimize to lower hardware very well at all
[2:04:24] <dukenux> EA is bad tho
[2:04:28] <$Midashu> Anthem was in development hell without a clear vision for YEARS
[2:04:35] <dukenux> it has melded with bad by this point
[2:04:36] <Kutakai666> welp
[2:04:37] <%KeynesianEconomist> this was mostly Biowares fault
[2:04:42] <%AncelDeLambert> EA spent a lot of money on it, it's the one game I'm willing to give EA a pass on, Bioware fucked up
[2:04:44] <+MikoNoPants> Hold on
[2:04:48] <dukenux> it cant let go
[2:04:48] <zamzoph> LUL
[2:04:53] <+MikoNoPants> You mean BIOWARE is pulling an EALA?
[2:04:56] <psychovaati721> This brings up a quote from Miyamoto: "A delayed game is eventually good, but a rushed game is forever bad."
[2:04:59] <Spydurman> The Jason Schrier article has a great perspective on it
[2:05:00] <%Darkmega97> that is too much of a 4D chess move
[2:05:01] <xeros720> kind of like how Gearbox stole all that Aliens dev money?
[2:05:02] <PauliusMaximus> anthem was scrapped multiple times and the release versions was under development for 18 months
[2:05:09] <IndoorSitup> That sounds dumb. No offense
[2:05:11] <Kutakai666> *snicker*
[2:05:17] <startstoprepeat> ea was actually pretty good to bioware for anthem, it's bioware that totally fucked it
[2:05:18] <dukenux> 6 years!!!
[2:05:24] <Golem100> EA don't care. Money talks, everything else is noise for their PR department to take care of.
[2:05:26] <%AncelDeLambert> yo why Schrier have the writing level of an eighth grader?
[2:05:28] <zamzoph> It's like Konami and Kojima
[2:05:30] <@Lardcat> Everybody give up some love for our super special guest, the amazing and wonderful, @AngriestPat! > https://twitter.com/AngriestPat/ & https://twitch.tv/AngriestPat/
[2:05:30] <+MikoNoPants> Like EALA did when they were told they were going to be fired after they did Red Alert 3 uprising and Command and Conquer 4
[2:05:34] <%FromThe70s> o o f
[2:05:35] <dukenux> oof
[2:05:42] <Nope80808> Ehhh
[2:05:45] <+Grayhammatter> oof
[2:05:49] <%Them00n> Just pure incompentence
[2:05:54] <NoctisxMog> huh
[2:05:59] <%grandtour11> EA not being the badguy? Whats that taste like?
[2:06:00] <Psyramics> They were waiting on the "Bioware magic" to swoop in and save the day like it always has and it never did
[2:06:02] <%AncelDeLambert> BIG incompetence
[2:06:03] <Nope80808> Good guy by doing nothing
[2:06:05] <%Darkmega97> the one time EA doesn't fuck everything up the devs fuck everything up
[2:06:10] <dukenux> EA is cursed, one tome they were a good guy, it blew in their fave
[2:06:21] <%AncelDeLambert> Don't DO that! Do what Nintendo did, tell us!
[2:06:22] <zamzoph> people like to pin blame on the publisher, but there are bad, incompetent devs too
[2:06:25] <IndoorSitup> Also that E3 2017 "demo" was ALL lies. Smoke and mirrors shit.
[2:06:29] <%TWolfJaeger> I wouldn't go so far as to absolve EA in the Anthem deal. Cutting content to chuck out a minimum viable product much?
[2:06:37] <%FromThe70s> LUL
[2:06:39] <KosOrSomeSayKosm_> LUL
[2:06:45] <xeros720> IT WAS YOUR FAULT PAT
[2:06:47] <%Them00n> Bad but not bad enough to be funny.
[2:06:48] <Nope80808> Pat = ME:A
[2:06:50] <%AncelDeLambert> I'm STILL being patient about Metroid, because Nintendo was nice and TOLD me!
[2:06:53] <+MikoNoPants> Everyone remembers what happened to EALA right? Formerly what hosted Westwood Studios
[2:06:57] <%Darkmega97> Obsidian is closer to the bioware people like than the current bioware
[2:06:59] <%FlakeyJunk> Andromeda was supposed to be the chosen one
[2:07:01] <Golem100> The downfall was the phrase "BioWare Magic" Where last minute crunch was magically transformed into something that was always going to fix a game. Until it didn't.
[2:07:01] <xeros720> pat ruined mass effect
[2:07:10] <dukenux> well, the gist is, nowadays its just """""""Bioware"""""
[2:07:14] <%AncelDeLambert> @IndoorSitup dude, it was so obvious they had nothing, I'm still amazed people bought day one
[2:07:19] <$FrostMass22> The city's rampant corruption? Pat sleep. Mass Effect Andromeda? Pat WOKE
[2:07:22] <ginjais> Between 3 and Andromeda I think I maybe lucked out by putting that series on the infinte backburner for too long
[2:07:31] <xeros720> Survive was actually good
[2:07:41] <+Mectec> Io
[2:07:43] <%Mathod> Rip Marauder ;(

[2:09:37] <+MikoNoPants> Im just bringing up EALA who unfortunately got told they would all lose their jobs after Command and Conquer 4 and that a part of Bioware would become EA Victory to make Generals 2 which also never happened
[2:09:40] <%AncelDeLambert> Big spooks

[2:10:34] <SpaceCatStation> xur is a good guy. he's just here to sell us his goods and have no control over his actions.
[2:10:35] <+TheDoomedTraveler> God that ME3 ending. Thank God for PC version ending mods. They don't make it a good ending, but at least being an okay ending is better than what we got
[2:10:36] <kaznachan> Spooctober not the same without Shitstorm ;_;
[2:10:36] <PasinPrime> Shy's Glyph can only get from giveaway?
[2:10:37] <%Darkmega97> *Talks to Xor* Wha you buyin?
[2:10:41] <Tucker0603> helm of saint-14
[2:10:59] <%Arturiafayth> What is nazaricks sin?
[2:11:05] <%AncelDeLambert> @IndoorSitup LUL quiettKek apatWhat sipsipElmo
[2:11:07] <Kutakai666> odd
[2:11:13] <Nope80808> @IndoorSitup The fact that it already got scrapped and restarted once to make it more livew service friend isnt reflecting positively for it.
[2:11:15] <@MGlBlaze> Nezarec
[2:11:29] <%Arturiafayth> That one yes blaze
[2:11:42] <Golem100> THey are going back to the D1 armor system with multiple perks on armor and stats like Int Dis Str. The biggest difference is some of the perks are in mods and removeable.
[2:11:50] <%AncelDeLambert> the modded endings of ME3 doesn't change anything important, to me. It still fucks up the symbiosis of Geth and Quarian I worked so hard for so fuck it
[2:11:51] <rtvzr> Lucky Pants can fscking slay in PvP :)
[2:11:58] <%croxeye> you can pull armor 2.0 exotics from your vault in shadowkeep
[2:12:03] <%sshen> RIP warlocks infinite ammo boots
[2:12:15] <%Mathod> *listens to them talk while being Destiny 2 newb* quiettGendo
[2:12:27] <Golem100> Everything is getting nerfed. Everything. Base damage on ads crits is getting slahsed in half.
[2:12:33] <+rebb_87> hey hey
[2:12:34] <Golem100> *slashed
[2:12:38] <Spydurman> at this time of day?
[2:12:48] <%Darkmega97> mire like Boringalis
[2:12:52] <%FlakeyJunk> Dat Arkhan upskirt.
[2:12:53] <%corrosivePaladin> Boralis also gets a nice damage boost when it breaks a shield
[2:12:56] <+Mectec> Bore good for nightfalls
[2:13:03] <Golem100> Supers will be comically weak and slow to generate. D2 year levels of hilarity.
[2:13:08] <Golem100> Year1
[2:13:19] <%AncelDeLambert> hey hey hey, Warframe nerds, is anyone still running Rhino relics? Because I still need an extra gold drop to sell and I've been on sabbatical since the vaulting.
[2:13:40] <%croxeye> I have a triple tap box breathing scout rifle ready for Shadowkeep :D
[2:13:41] <Nope80808> God i hate 1st person platforming
[2:13:41] <xeros720> sounds like Half Life
[2:14:13] <Golem100> All damage based perks like Ramapge , Kill Clip (all the good perks basically) are getting nerfed into the ground too
[2:14:30] <Nope80808> Dying light and mirrors edge are execptions but in most other its painful
[2:14:32] <xeros720> metroid prime was really a mecha game in disguise
[2:14:33] <+Mectec> just hold a sword during jumps
[2:14:38] <COLDSNOWKILLER> just gotta channel your inner mountain goat
[2:14:41] <%AncelDeLambert> floaty jumps, yeah
[2:14:42] <vergil44> Just use a sword you filthy casuals DansGame
[2:14:47] <+MikoNoPants> Metroid Prime also had 100 percent air control when you were aiming
[2:15:07] <%AncelDeLambert> astral chain platforming SUCKS, so hey, it aint all first person problems
[2:15:07] <Golem100> Breakneck is getting slaughtered
[2:15:19] <%croxeye> breakneck got double nerfed
[2:15:21] <%AncelDeLambert> (I fucking hate the AC platforming, my god)
[2:15:24] <Golem100> damage of breakneck cut by 64%
[2:15:30] <@Lardcat> If you would like to donate directly to Shy, click the Bit button (looks like a pyramid) on the right side of the chat bar. quiettCash You'll need to purchase the bits, and then cheer# the amount you wish to give. All donations are helpful and appreciated, no matter how big or small! quiettAww
[2:15:52] <%Mathod> Mug revolvers tho BibleThump
[2:15:53] <KosOrSomeSayKosm_> I'm gonna start playing destiny 2 in a while when it becomes free to play, and BOY am I gonna regret not paying attention to all this destiny talk
[2:16:04] <+MikoNoPants> Then again i sequence broke Metroid Prime 1
[2:16:05] <+kabuhiro> yeah bungo is also nerfing pve head damage
[2:16:07] <%Arturiafayth> I rarely used handguns though
[2:16:13] <Tucker0603> hope lumina is still gonna be good
[2:16:15] <%AncelDeLambert> OMG LUL, I thought she said "Head Canon is getting nerfed across the board" haha
[2:16:20] <+Mectec> LW will still be useful, range isnt important for its power
[2:16:24] <xxterminatorviixx> TLW is still gonna kill apes
[2:16:32] <%AncelDeLambert> "omg what lore are they changing that's destroying head canon?"
[2:16:33] <CaptainFuzzkill> Looking good, Shy.
[2:16:43] <%heyello> I saw someone who got their Chiappa Rhino, an IRL revolver, made to look like the Ace of Spades, and it looks sexy AF
[2:16:47] <%AncelDeLambert> Big spoopy, Shy
[2:16:49] <COLDSNOWKILLER> It was not that hard, Jesus.
[2:16:53] <Golem100> PC has virtually no recoil. Handcannons and SMGs are completely different weps on PC. On console, they are dogsh*t compared to D1 and PC.
[2:16:57] <rtvzr> Destiny 2 PVP is odd. It is slow and the TTK is pretty low. In good old quake it is the opposite: movement is fast and TTK is high
[2:17:01] <%Mathod> Just
[2:17:01] <$Midashu> With all this D2 talk I wonder what they AREN'T nerfing
[2:17:03] <%Mathod> DO EEET
[2:17:12] <Golem100> To be fair though, console D2 is extremely rough in all aspects, not just the guns
[2:17:19] <%croxeye> tlw is very fun
[2:17:25] <%Darkmega97> Fun in video games? WutFace
[2:17:29] <+Grayhammatter> PogChamp
[2:17:33] <%norgthefish> What bout shotguns?
[2:17:35] <%AncelDeLambert> I've never played Destiny, so all of this means nothing and I'll get to try a brand new game on Tues
[2:17:36] <%Arturiafayth> Where are you reading those nerfs then?
[2:17:41] <+Grayhammatter> but actually though
[2:17:42] <Golem100> Yep, range of pulses is getting brought down to give scouts a place.
[2:17:42] <+Lambda_man> I've always fantasized about becoming a gunsmith specifically to make game guns real
[2:17:43] <%AncelDeLambert> so SUCK IT nerds
[2:17:48] <+DarlingDeer> Love the color of the nails, Shy!
[2:17:50] <Golem100> Nobody uses scouts
[2:17:51] <osterionmalfice> shy, you making a mod drop chance fiasco?
[2:18:08] <%Lambda_man> Lambda_man subscribed with Twitch Prime. 
[2:18:14] <Golem100> Polaris is cool
[2:18:15] <+Ascethetic> all this talk about D2 makes me wanna play again
[2:18:17] <$dirtyh4rr1> ackchually
[2:18:20] <%grandtour11> ROFL all these actualys
[2:18:23] <Tucker0603> wait what?
[2:18:33] <xxterminatorviixx> Jade rabbit is king
[2:18:34] <%croxeye> Desperado is getting a Nerf tho
[2:18:39] <%nasko5310> aCtUaLy
[2:18:39] <startstoprepeat> they listed desperado, redrix's perk, in amongst the damage increasing perks that are getting nerfed
[2:18:41] <%corrosivePaladin> Broadsword is just a long quest
[2:18:41] <Tucker0603> I thought it was getting a bit of a Nerf?
[2:18:46] <COLDSNOWKILLER> Redrix isn't hard it's just an ads drag of a quest
[2:18:55] <murasaur> Needs a biggah choppah
[2:19:01] <Golem100> Pinnacle weps are gone now incidently. THere will be no more super powerful pinnacle weps from now on
[2:19:03] <osterionmalfice> wait is this a d2 stream now?
[2:19:16] <murasaur> moar dakka
[2:19:17] <%corrosivePaladin> The 5 resets isnt hard. I got 7 resets purely off Iron Banner
[2:19:35] <%AncelDeLambert> Off topic question to Pat (and possible others): If I find myself with extra cash this week, what should I buy, Surge 2 or animoo vampires?
[2:19:48] <Rixtah> My drink gotta a huge nerf right now. LUL
[2:19:51] <%norgthefish> I kinda see a pattern
[2:19:53] <Golem100> yeh, you have to remember most of the pinnacle weps were basically a perk in a gun. A unique and strong perk for sure
[2:19:55] <%Arturiafayth> Where is that destiny baro now by the way?
[2:20:00] <%croxeye> just blast furnace man
[2:20:05] <%norgthefish> all OP SUPER GOD TIER guns in D2 are from PVP
[2:20:06] <$Midashu> PvP with friends is fun, PvP Solo is a trash fire
[2:20:07] <%heyello> IMO any game that forces people to do PVP to get stuff for PVE is poorly designed
[2:20:07] <+Mectec> valor resets rather easy, i think im at 14th-15th reset now for the season
[2:20:08] <+kabuhiro> the best part of the broadsword quest is 25 normal pvp, 25 rumble, and 25 comp
[2:20:09] <KosOrSomeSayKosm_> both code veing and surge 2 are pretty solid so...
[2:20:26] <%norgthefish> who could have guessed that something that is super good against player is good against everything else
[2:20:30] <@Lardcat> quiettBob Today, Shy is not drawing, but painting some more of her Warhammer miniatures! Enjoy~! quiettBob
[2:20:32] <Golem100> comp LUL
[2:20:42] <+Ascethetic> thats too much pvp
[2:20:45] <%Arturiafayth> @MGlBlaze Where is the destiny version of baro now? Never found him before
[2:20:50] <+DarlingDeer> in a D A Y?
[2:21:02] <%AncelDeLambert> @heyello I would be willing to replay Dark Souls 3 AGAIN if and only if someone were to give me a mod that let you buy pvp gear with regular souls
[2:21:03] <+Grayhammatter> oh good, i'm dog shit at PvP in general
[2:21:15] <Golem100> he's on IO selling sadness as usual Keepo
[2:21:21] <%FromThe70s> What kind of porn!?!
[2:21:27] <%Darkmega97> 25 normal, 25 rumble, 25 comp, 25 pornography
[2:21:34] <%AncelDeLambert> @KosOrSomeSayKosm_ that's the problem, I can't justify playing both, so I have to choose..
[2:21:37] <xeros720> i'm not even sure pat can bluff
[2:21:41] <%FromThe70s> cakefarts!! woot
[2:21:44] <%jimthebingle> jimthebingle subscribed with Twitch Prime. They've subscribed for 16 months, currently on a 16 month streak! Buy Skyrim
[2:21:46] <Golem100> runble is at least ususally quick
[2:21:49] <+DarlingDeer> caaaeeek fheirts
[2:22:05] <+Grayhammatter> LUL
[2:22:06] <xeros720> everytime pat says something, it's always true
[2:22:11] <xeros720> it's concerning
[2:22:12] <%sshen> Watch out Pat is a clim hazard
[2:22:13] <$Midashu> Go eat something!
[2:22:14] <+Ascethetic> Pat's bluff is so good, it just sounds terrible
[2:22:14] <%AncelDeLambert> lie to us, Pat
[2:22:15] <%Darkmega97> Pat not bluffing is the bluff
[2:22:16] <Tucker0603> so what is happening to redrix's cause it's my favorite
[2:22:17] <%AncelDeLambert> LIE
[2:22:18] <COLDSNOWKILLER> Not Forgotten is hardest to get because that requires teammates
[2:22:22] <%AncelDeLambert> see, can't do it
[2:22:30] <SlimeSlimeSlime> If Pat tried to bluff any harder, he'd be named Cliff.
[2:22:43] <Golem100> It's because they split all the nerfs into TWABs spanning over a couple of months
[2:22:44] <rtvzr> The patch notes for shadowkeep aren't fully live yet I think
[2:22:55] <+Grayhammatter> Cliffy Blezyinski
[2:22:57] <%AncelDeLambert> hee hee hee
[2:23:00] <Tucker0603> cause I heard Desperado was getting nerfed
[2:23:03] <%AncelDeLambert> Cliffy BINCH
[2:23:04] <%Darkmega97> Randy
[2:23:06] <+Ascethetic> RANDY NO
[2:23:06] <+MikoNoPants> Cliffy B. poor man
[2:23:08] <+Grayhammatter> GOTTEM
[2:23:11] <TREEMAN9999> gottem
[2:23:11] <+DarlingDeer> i thought it waw a geography joke, cliffs and bluffs and plateus and stuff
[2:23:12] <%AncelDeLambert> he is ALSO a binch
[2:23:12] <%sshen> RANDY NO
[2:23:17] <+MikoNoPants> Cliff was good in his day but went down hard
[2:23:18] <Rixtah> Ouch!
[2:23:19] <$dirtyh4rr1> ladies and gentlemen, we got'em
[2:23:20] <%heyello> A bluff is also the name for a sheer dropoff, AKA a cliff
[2:23:22] <Starchildtw> Bluffs are part of cliffs
[2:23:23] <%AncelDeLambert> Randy Pitch-a-fit
[2:23:24] <$Midashu> "Lawbreakers is the Dark Souls of First Person Shooters"
[2:23:25] <mayorrev> You couldn't see it but you could tell Pat hit the HARDEST dab in his life
[2:23:35] <KosOrSomeSayKosm_> @AncelDeLambert I guess it's a question of what you prefer then big LARGE mechanical armor and lots of loot OR animooo and lots of build variety
[2:23:38] <%Darkmega97> Cliffy like to think he paid his employees's severance pay
[2:23:43] <%sshen> Cliffy fired his whole company ON TWITTER
[2:23:50] <%FromThe70s> heh
[2:23:51] <+MikoNoPants> Cliffy B Should have just held on to Gears of War and he would have been fine
[2:23:56] <dukenux> Who is the biggest liar of them all? CliffyB, Randy, Todd, or good ol Peter Molineux?
[2:24:03] <Kutakai666> weird
[2:24:03] <zwhitekz> oof
[2:24:09] <%AncelDeLambert> @KosOrSomeSayKosm_ ... see I can't choooooooose!
[2:24:17] <dukenux> And then you double teamed him with Paige LUL
[2:24:20] <Golem100> Radical Heights, now there's a name I haven't heard in a long time. LUL
[2:24:20] <+MikoNoPants> Cliffy B at least wouldn't Lie as much as the others
[2:24:20] <%FromThe70s> But.. it is kinda his fault though
[2:24:24] <SlimeSlimeSlime> Pat dunked on Cliffy pretty damn hard, well done, Sir.
[2:24:27] <+MikoNoPants> but he did become a douche
[2:24:28] <%AncelDeLambert> Dammit, why'd I have to drop so much cash on a gym?
[2:24:34] <QT_pa2T_OnDuty> I think Peter Molineux is more delusional than a liar
[2:24:38] <%AncelDeLambert> I could be playing vidya
[2:24:47] <Kutakai666> ouch
[2:24:54] <dukenux> And yet he can't pay his employees fairly Kappa hmm
[2:24:55] <%sshen> Cliffy never told his employees they were fired until they saw it on twittee
[2:25:00] <COLDSNOWKILLER> Cliffy B used to look like a wannabe back street boy.
[2:25:03] <+MikoNoPants> Cliffy B used to be something
[2:25:11] <%TWolfJaeger> Randy Bitchfraud hands in the Fig pie is literally the only reason I'm on the fence about Homeworld 3
[2:25:13] <%AncelDeLambert> Cliffy is a late 90s early 2000s douche celeb
[2:25:18] <%FromThe70s> oh jesus christ
[2:25:18] <bomi1995> and then he tried to bring ice t into it
[2:25:18] <dukenux> ???
[2:25:26] <+senseman95> hallouuuuuw ungeH

[2:25:31] <eanscrale> That's messed up.
[2:25:32] <%AncelDeLambert> that's RIGHT
[2:25:36] <$FrostMass22> Because Bioshock Infinite killed Roger Ebery
[2:25:37] <%FromThe70s> Blaze has Anthem on the brain
[2:25:39] <dukenux> Woah, that's really deep Cliffy, very cool
[2:25:41] <+DarlingDeer> hewwo uwu
[2:25:44] <+Grayhammatter> it's a shame
[2:25:46] <Golem100> IT was no Bioshack 1
[2:25:46] <dukenux> Bioshock 2 best bioshock
[2:25:51] <Golem100> *Bioshock
[2:25:54] <zamzoph> I like Bioshock Infinite.... Except the DLC, fuck that
[2:25:57] <%FromThe70s> I liked it too, for like a day
[2:25:58] <+Ascethetic> FUCKING SAME
[2:26:01] <+MikoNoPants> Cliffy B was good for Unreal Tournament in the day, Good for Gears of War 1 and 2 and im not sure he had a hand in 3 when he handed things to Rod Ferguson
[2:26:02] <KosOrSomeSayKosm_> @AncelDeLambert in that case, believe in the tiddy, embrace it, caress it. Code Vein also has an incredible character creator so if you are into that...
[2:26:03] <%FromThe70s> LOL
[2:26:05] <dukenux> OOF
[2:26:07] <%AncelDeLambert> Bioshock Infinite has a up its own ass story trying to be deeper than it is
[2:26:07] <Fien111> Yikes
[2:26:09] <%sshen> Cliffy has some SA posts that would be awful to come back on him these days they were bad
[2:26:09] <xeros720> ahaha
[2:26:13] <zamzoph> Bioshock Infinite isn't about racism tho
[2:26:13] <IronGlorfindel> I liked it, and DID play it again. Biggest mistake.
[2:26:14] <+Grayhammatter> oof
[2:26:14] <QT_pa2T_OnDuty> So David Cage?
[2:26:15] <%norgthefish> oof
[2:26:21] <$FrostMass22> Bioshock Infinite should have gotten a sequel so there could be at least one good Infinite game
[2:26:22] <+Grayhammatter> Bioshock 2 is my favorite
[2:26:23] <xeros720> bioshock 2 lets you become the drill boy
[2:26:24] <Kutakai666> well, that's a summary
[2:26:39] <%heyello> Detroit: Become Sterotype
[2:26:44] <+Grayhammatter> but omikron though pat
[2:26:45] <+didyouthinkofthis> suffer in omikron
[2:26:51] <%sshen> OMIKRON PAT
[2:26:54] <Golem100> The BioShock games were never about the amazing combat. They were passable in that regard at least. Story was great in 1 though.
[2:26:55] <Fien111> Bioshock 1 is weird because it ends DEFINITIVELY and then keeps going
[2:27:00] <$FrostMass22> One David Cage game has a Chinese Secret Underwater Ghost Base
[2:27:02] <dukenux> It is... and it isn't. Its about racism, classism, religious fanatiscism, jingoism, alternate universe theory... all of it mashed into a colorful mess
[2:27:21] <%croxeye> Bioshock infinites "but both sides tho" is completely awful
[2:27:22] <~QuietteShy> ok i think thats where im gonna stop today
[2:27:24] <%AncelDeLambert> Bioshock 2 is one of those games that divides me with myself. YES, it absolutely is mechanically better to its prequel. But it's also written by a concussed rheesus monkey
[2:27:25] <CasualCoreK> remember, detroit: become human's message is OBVIOUSLY not about race
[2:27:27] <Kutakai666> yeesh
[2:27:33] <%heyello> Detroit: Become Heavy Handed Symbolism
[2:27:33] <dukenux> This game where a black android goes to the back of the bus is NOT ABOUT RACISM AT ALL
[2:27:39] <%FromThe70s> Noice
[2:27:42] <%FromThe70s> f70sNice
