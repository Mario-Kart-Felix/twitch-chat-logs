[0:21:24] <@SarahTsang> David Cage pls no

[0:22:05] <%MaxCrazyDude> Hi Sarah VoHiYo
[0:22:06] <+ConLin_Arts_> Kojima has ambition at least, and he finally did a new IP after 18 years!

[0:22:20] <Kurisuchan99> Kojima games are great in their ambitions, themes, stories and characters, but the tone is all over the place.
[0:22:24] <dukenux> hi chat and streamers
[0:22:32] <+ConLin_Arts_> yeh
[0:22:33] <dukenux> killing people is BADONG

[0:23:08] <%Razputin217> also here's Conan O'Brian in a funny hat
[0:23:11] <+sleepy_villain> You can do a lot with hands. Kill a man, hold a baby, peel an orange
[0:23:13] <$workingwater0> Hands? *yoshikage Kira wants to know your location*
[0:23:16] <%Varlinator> You have to love ohnKoji
[0:23:21] <$Kurudan> Was B.B. a metaphor for males giving birth or something? Haven't played DS yet.

[0:24:32] <+ConLin_Arts_> MGS 2 is amazing
[0:24:38] <@SarahTsang> bytvThink
[0:24:39] <dukenux> i havent seen Mother! but Aronofsky does give away strong hack vibes sometimes.
[0:24:41] <%Varlinator> That's accurate
[0:24:45] <alphonseisbest> yup that's in 2
[0:24:51] <flinch346> Wha!?
[0:24:51] <%MaxCrazyDude> Nope, MGS 2
[0:24:52] <CaptainPileDriver> mgs2 is fucking nuts
[0:24:52] <$Casardis> dkdiaHearts Beast Wars!
[0:24:55] <bomi1995> that does in fact happen

[0:25:17] <@Lardcat> quiettBob Today, Shy is drawing an old-time favorite, Beast Wars Optimus Primal! Enjoy~!
[0:25:18] <$workingwater0> Truly bizarre, a bizarre adventure perhaps?
[0:25:19] <Shishi1205> Fucking Policenauts lmao
[0:25:22] <Fujiwara_92> GENIUS KOJUMBO
[0:25:23] <+jeancly> it's just like one of my japanese anime !!!
[0:25:23] <dukenux> Naomi Campbell, the supermodel, is a MGS character?
[0:25:25] <+ConLin_Arts_> Vamp is weird, his name isn't for Vampire, its because he's Bisexual
[0:25:32] <+Ratmut> rooREE @Casardis
[0:25:33] <$Casardis> quiettSpinner
[0:25:39] <+goliath013> All i ever wanted was Zone of the Enders 3 from Kojima
[0:25:47] <+sleepy_villain> But he's also a vampire tho
[0:25:48] <$Casardis> @ratmut f70sSmug
[0:25:48] <0rond> kojoombo is the best
[0:25:56] <dukenux> but hes also a vampire, right?
[0:25:56] <@SarahTsang> Heavy Rain....man...
[0:25:59] <CaptainPileDriver> detroit isn't about anything, remember that
[0:26:01] <BicBoiChavo> Cage is so incompetent that it's entertaining
[0:26:03] <$workingwater0> Wait, bisexual and a vampire? He literally is just dio
[0:26:04] <0rond> heavy rain could have been great if it weren't so bad
[0:26:11] <AncelDeLambert> the game lies super hard
[0:26:14] <+ConLin_Arts_> Detroit lies the most though
[0:26:22] <%Varlinator> Why did he call the cops on himself?!
[0:26:23] <%xana0908> Shawn screaming simulator is ok
[0:26:23] <+ConLin_Arts_> it keeps a big plotpoint from you
[0:26:27] <dukenux> Detroit could be good if it was about anything
[0:26:38] <+ConLin_Arts_> I hate the Detroit plot twist
[0:26:41] <%Razputin217> Unreliable narrator
[0:26:42] <flinch346> Beyond two souls is better than heavy rain imo
[0:26:42] <+DocIrving> Something something SHADOW PUZZLES
[0:26:42] <CaptainPileDriver> man, fuck detroit
[0:26:44] <dukenux> or just a Connor/Hank buddy cop plot
[0:26:50] <CaptainPileDriver> detroit ISN'T ABOUT RACISM
[0:26:53] <@SarahTsang> David Cage....is a mess...
[0:26:53] <Cute_Arsonist> David Cage is the Tommy Wiseau of video games
[0:26:58] <AncelDeLambert> Detroit has shitty characters with terrible motivations
[0:27:03] <+Kavtech> Connor was great.
[0:27:06] <Fujiwara_92> the only good thing in detroid is Connor and Hank
[0:27:09] <+SethSkyberg> mokiron is the greatest game ever made
[0:27:09] <+ConLin_Arts_> because your character SEES the thing but it's only at the end they hammer it in what she saw
[0:27:11] <+Vermilingus> Detroit is David Cage's best game, but that's not a high bar.
[0:27:18] <%xana0908> Detroit isn‚Äôt about race it‚Äôs about ROBOTS
[0:27:18] <P1antsaMan> SHAWN
[0:27:24] <Huntercd> Don't insult Tommy like that
[0:27:30] <%Razputin217> Conner and Hank parts Good, everything else Bad
[0:27:36] <dukenux> "We put the black android on the back of the bus. It doesnt really mean anything."
[0:27:46] <+DocIrving> It won best editing: Star Wars, but not anything else at the time/
[0:27:47] <CaptainPileDriver> balloon, gotta get the balloon, balloon, gotta get the balloon
[0:27:47] <+inquisitor_ganamead> '"the problem with David Cage games, is David Cage'"
[0:27:48] <oberonkin> I got here as quick as i could and i have literally no idea who these guests are and why shy is drawing a monky
[0:27:51] <+ConLin_Arts_> Hank is Mr. Krabs
[0:27:54] <%xana0908> No would make David Cage games wayyyy better
[0:27:54] <PylonDogg> That erasering is giving me an aneurysm. One of the many reasons I've done digital almost exclusively for over a decade now.
[0:27:55] <jaaythianayala> s!
[0:27:58] <+sgtgeneralcog> Its a "don't let hank die" plot
[0:27:58] <P1antsaMan> Also, I gotta head out, enjoy the rest of the stream!
[0:28:03] <AncelDeLambert> ah, so it's terrible then
[0:28:04] <CaptainPileDriver> it's a corporate barbie doll
[0:28:05] <+SoarFlyer> I bet it's *opinion*
[0:28:06] <@SarahTsang> @P1antsaMan see you later :3
[0:28:08] <$Casardis> @inquisitor_ganamead accurate statement
[0:28:11] <$BallerSwagBro9k> It's all over the place
[0:28:12] <ephemeralMichael> what a lovely mess
[0:28:24] <ephemeralMichael> ive been waiting for this stream all day
[0:28:24] <+sleepy_villain> almost a million people have eyed this watchy-drawy. Is that a typical number?

[0:29:02] <ephemeralMichael> ive come at the perfect time
[0:29:06] <ephemeralMichael> i love this
[0:29:06] <CaptainPileDriver> dude, it's a riot
[0:29:13] <AncelDeLambert> it's almost like the corporate boardroom doesn't know how to make a film
[0:29:16] <CaptainPileDriver> it's not great.
[0:29:17] <$Kurudan> Seems like a 6/10 as a regular movie, but a 2/10 for hard core sw fans.
[0:29:28] <Essixian> I missed it, which movie are they talking about?
[0:29:29] <nvst4rk> ROS is trash
[0:29:31] <CaptainPileDriver> tHE MOVIE ENDS ON THE WORST LINE EVER
[0:29:32] <Fujiwara_92> it's fun for the hole family NotLikeThis
[0:29:37] <Essixian> Oh, the new SW, okay.
[0:29:39] <+ConLin_Arts_> ep. 1 had JarJar
[0:29:41] <+inquisitor_ganamead> RoS is ether amazing or the worst thing ever, there is no between
[0:29:41] <AncelDeLambert> it's almost like you can buy talent but you can't force the talent you buy to be consistent
[0:29:47] <dukenux> Mediocre!
[0:29:51] <$BallerSwagBro9k> Haven't laughed so much since Jurassic World 2
[0:29:53] <+DocIrving> So, wait, what would Ep 1 be, rating wise?
[0:30:00] <%Varlinator> quiettHypee quiettHypee quiettHypee quiettHypee I'M IN THE BOOK!
[0:30:00] <%MaxCrazyDude> From what I heard its en exposition overload.
[0:30:02] <@SarahTsang> i haven't seen Star Wars since... Force Awakens
[0:30:02] <dukenux> That sounds like TLJ to me, Pat

[0:30:10] <MY5T0G4N> thanks, Am I the only one that thinks the scenes on the ships are Warframe-esque?
[0:30:10] <@SarahTsang> @AtomQRabbit <3
[0:30:10] <$workingwater0> I haven‚Äôt seen it but is the character death palpateen (angry electrician) just getting ragdolled off something?

[0:30:25] <@SarahTsang> @Slap Hi Slapppppppp
[0:30:26] <ASkeleton> The only prop I can give it is that it didn't make me angry like TLJ did, it just left me feeling hollow
[0:30:27] <Kurisuchan99> I'd give it a 3. For context, a 5 for me is mediocre.
[0:30:29] <kylooooren> lol getting star wars ads 4Head
[0:30:29] <ephemeralMichael> oh my god this is a riot
[0:30:36] <AncelDeLambert> I've managed to avoid every Disney SW property and it's gonna stay that way
[0:30:38] <%Varlinator> @SarahTsang You're not missing out on much
[0:30:39] <+yoghi63> oh man i watched that final episode and oof
[0:30:41] <shrodingersdogg> J J Abrams is doing the warframe movie right?
[0:30:43] <+rider_megalon> Best ending ever
[0:30:48] <+Kavtech> Star Wars is a video game series and nothing will make me think otherwise.
[0:30:50] <Fujiwara_92> Inuyasha? DansGame

[0:30:56] <%Slap> Love you all
[0:31:01] <$Kurudan> I stopped watching Inu Yasha because he was boring. I just skipped through for Sesshoumaru shenanigans with the human girl
[0:31:04] <+ConLin_Arts_> the... the Warframe movie?? WHat???
[0:31:05] <@SarahTsang> @Varlinator i think i just ...stopped caring after all the new stuff...
[0:31:05] <+bubbli97> wait like killing a characterization or just straight up killing the character?
[0:31:08] <ephemeralMichael> whats she drawing today?
[0:31:14] <dukenux> wasnt JJ suppose to make the Portal movie
[0:31:16] <@Roz_Lynd> !drawing
[0:31:16] <@Lardcat> quiettBob Today, Shy is drawing an old-time favorite, Beast Wars Optimus Primal! Enjoy~!
[0:31:16] <%Bass1015> I just remember up to like the band of seven or whatever, but neat, Naraku dies finally I guess
[0:31:19] <Kutakai666> Casual SW fan here, I found TRoS to be a satisfying conclusion to the story. I loved it, flaws and all.
[0:31:24] <ASkeleton> There's more dumb stuff than good stuff
[0:31:36] <%Varlinator> @SarahTsang I'm right there with you
[0:31:36] <ephemeralMichael> oh my god this is my favorite stream now
[0:31:38] <+ConLin_Arts_> JJ makes Video Game the Movie
[0:31:41] <CaptainPileDriver> go see cats instead, its hilarious
[0:31:41] <MY5T0G4N> For me the ending ruined everything the movie was building to
[0:31:42] <shrodingersdogg> @conlin_arts_ not a movie movie but the new intro scene, its on yt
[0:31:46] <ephemeralMichael> all of my favorites colliding in a hot mess
[0:31:51] <$workingwater0> Remember a simple story told well will always be better than a complex story told poorly
[0:31:51] <+sgtgeneralcog> @ephemeralmichael Optimus Primal from beast wars
[0:31:55] <$Casardis> Mcguffin central
[0:31:55] <+inquisitor_ganamead> (spoiler) its just the plot of dark empire
[0:31:55] <%Mezuka> I've only been told that Rise of Skywalker was shit, but vast majority of my friends absolutely hated TLJ and current SW direction
[0:31:57] <+yoghi63> just yeeted all the characters into oblivion and then it looked like they went "k shit's over goodnight"
[0:32:01] <Krampl> ffs this face impression of monkey
[0:32:06] <+Aeogard> Looks like Jedi: Fallen Order is the better Star Wars release this year >:)
[0:32:07] <dredshift> If you only could go to the mediocrose RoS or the amazing disaster that is Cats, which would you choose?
[0:32:09] <Krampl> SMOrc
[0:32:09] <+l3sovikk> How'd you get Pat to wake up so early?
[0:32:15] <@Roz_Lynd> we asked him to
[0:32:18] <Shishi1205> The fact that Cats got patch notes for a fix lmao
[0:32:32] <+sleepy_villain> Yo real talk tho, that peach spinner is on point
[0:32:32] <AncelDeLambert> you mean they're in Night, Paige
[0:32:33] <$BallerSwagBro9k> @aeogard Hands down
[0:32:35] <Huntercd> Where are the Twi'leks?!
[0:32:37] <ephemeralMichael> no chocolate orange bribes? sure.
[0:32:39] <zeox91> Better go and look mandalorian
[0:32:41] <@SarahTsang> @Shishi1205 the reviews for cats were all hilarious
[0:32:41] <dukenux> I am for real pondering if i should go watch The Cats, instead TROS. As far as amusingly awful movies go.
[0:32:43] <$guinibir> what is this thing she's drawing?
[0:32:46] <flinch346> Has anyone watched the Cats movie?
[0:32:47] <@SarahTsang> !drawing

[0:32:52] <$Kurudan> Anyone watch the surreal experience that is CATS?
[0:32:59] <Essixian> They're aliens, they're SUPPOSED to look weird and stupid.
[0:33:17] <Shishi1205> Every last review mentions lovecraftian experiences
[0:33:18] <@SarahTsang> @Kurudan i'd rather stick with Cats The Musical ...coz it's my fave musical...
[0:33:20] <$BallerSwagBro9k> @flinch346 That film is creepy. It's a horny furry film.
[0:33:21] <+ConLin_Arts_> @shrodingersdogg the one by Dan Trachtenberg (the Uncharted movie)?
[0:33:25] <Shishi1205> Its a riot
[0:33:29] <simaris_united> snoke has the big gay
[0:33:46] <flinch346> @ballerswagbro9k LUL
[0:33:46] <LixFury> Cats is a god damn monstrosity
[0:33:51] <dukenux> Lotsa people who like TLJ are also on the front lines of hating on TROS
[0:33:53] <+Kavtech> @Kurudan I've heard the panicked ramblings of the maddened men who fled the theater.
[0:33:57] <ASkeleton> YEAH! RoS was _desperate_ to delete TLJ, it was actually hilarious
[0:33:57] <+Aeogard> Last Jedi had so much potential to shake up the formula and be so... intersting :(
[0:34:00] <AncelDeLambert> don't give Disney any room. TLJ was caused by Disney, they signed off on it, they were giving notes, they made the movie
[0:34:04] <$Kurudan> @SarahTsang Good choice. If you do watch it, expect.....um....something?
[0:34:05] <AncelDeLambert> TLJ is Disney's fault

[0:34:18] <ihate_avacados> Hi
[0:34:25] <$Kurudan> @Kavtech Yeah, I read the reviews. They were hilarious
[0:34:26] <%Varlinator> LUL
[0:34:26] <+Kavtech> The green side.
[0:34:30] <%xana0908> Last Jedi might as well be an AU

[0:42:54] <Essixian> So, Stargate SG-1 is good. What's the opinion on Atlantis? In my opinion it's not quite as good as SG-1, but still great.
[0:43:03] <$workingwater0> You know a really good show on Netflix? Violet evergarden, my god that show is a masterpiece

[1:01:24] <+RedDeadApple> @Varlinator to me he was such a comedic character and i loved him
[1:01:29] <$Wolfsheim126> HahaGingercat
[1:01:37] <ASkeleton> Oh noooooo Paige is a message board dweller
[1:01:38] <AncelDeLambert> the only thing I really remember from Beastwars is Optimal telling Ratrap to go out and shoot fuckers while he runs out and does something dangerous, and Ratrap bitches out
[1:01:42] <KitsuneManami> a big character was killed off in Beast Machines, who was it
[1:01:42] <+Underfiend> dang if that isn't an age check...
[1:01:45] <$BallerSwagBro9k> gOD IS DEAD AND PAIGE KILLED HIM LUL

[1:01:51] <%Pesuto> Paige is making me remember the Youtube Bionicle community and how all over the place it fucking was
[1:01:52] <$workingwater0> I feel like the drawing could use some more fluff on the legs, like what‚Äôs on the arms
[1:01:53] <Edgy_raven> I randomly logged into this stream and now I'm losing it
[1:02:00] <$Kurudan> I didn't care much for beast machines. I did like the overarching mystery, but I didn't care for the characters like I did before.
[1:02:04] <Sunstalker> Paige, do'nt lsiten to Pat. I was on a Bionicle message board as a kid and it was the best. vadeAYA
[1:02:05] <%Pesuto> RED SKIES PogChamp
[1:02:05] <KitsuneManami> LOL PAT-TRAP
[1:02:06] <hyperdrive404> ok this is a random question but is aksomatii prime better than akstiletto prime?
[1:02:07] <agadejobi> Well, the problem with Beast Machines, is that it's a radical change from Beast Wars
[1:02:08] <%Varlinator> @RedDeadApple Fair enough
[1:02:14] <$BallerSwagBro9k> @Pesuto Ayyyyyy i was there LUL
[1:02:17] <DotDusk> I know that voice! It smells like mustard! FeelsGoodMan

[1:02:25] <@Roz_Lynd> sure does
[1:02:31] <agadejobi> It has some decent ideas, but the problem is that nothing from Beast Wars remains
[1:02:31] <ASkeleton> Actually I can't talk because I was a frequent Bionicle message board dweller
[1:02:39] <KitsuneManami> Someone draw Pat-Trap
[1:02:47] <+komradedog> Yo how fucked up is noble/savage in beast machines?
[1:02:51] <agadejobi> Beast Machines could have worked if it was something stand alone
[1:02:57] <zeox91> Tecno organic
[1:02:59] <KitsuneManami> oooo Yes!....oh...yea...
[1:03:05] <KitsuneManami> god damn hasbro
[1:03:10] <agadejobi> But when you take the Beast Wars characters and throw them into that, then it kinda sucks
[1:03:10] <zeox91> That was the plot, the tecno organic thing
[1:03:11] <+sgtgeneralcog> Anybody remember beetleborgs
[1:03:11] <%Pesuto> Does Shy have a cake and coffee off-screen?

[1:06:02] <+goliath013> @Paige. When i met scott mcneil at the con i went to his fave line for rat trap was. "I know i know... shut up rat trap" heh
[1:06:03] <+FlipsVsTheWorld> Even though Shy isn't done drawing. It's weird seeing Optimus Primal with such detail and texture LUL
[1:06:07] <@SarahTsang> okay byeeeeeeeeeeeeee
[1:06:13] <%Pesuto> Considering that Pat spent a fuckton of money on Warframe, I think Paige paying a voice actor for creepy sexy acting is fair game
[1:06:18] <agadejobi> I'm always ready to admit when old shows that I loved are actually awful
[1:06:18] <+Underfiend> i've expended my flux energy

[1:06:39] <+tweedler92> Thats how I did Firefly
[1:06:39] <+Aeogard> i wanted to make an awful joke at pat's expense here but i felt instantly bad
[1:06:41] <Edgy_raven> boy I remember when I oculd still buy Beast wars toys in stores
[1:06:44] <$Essixian> Paige should do a dramatic reading of those Transformers comics that Fred Perry has done. Kappa
[1:06:44] <+LeoDrakoniX> @pesuto JFC LUL
[1:06:45] <KitsuneManami> Has anyone seen Hyper Police? super old anime with nekos n shit

[1:06:49] <%Varlinator> That happened for me with Firefly
[1:06:50] <hellhoundoom> that's my life with series
[1:06:54] <ASkeleton> @BallerSwagBro9k I had all the gen 1 Bohrok, two of the gen 1 Toa, all the gen 2 Toa and Bohrok, all the Rahkshi, all the gen 3 Toa, all the Vahki, most of the Hordika, best girl Roodaka and all of the Visorak
[1:06:59] <agadejobi> Back in the day, the Mario cartoons were my jam
[1:07:01] <nvst4rk> I like Transformers, but I could not care less about the concept of Beast Wars
[1:07:02] <+Bane_Kaikyo> I feel that DK
[1:07:06] <+Glitchesarecool> I miss beast wars
[1:07:13] <+Underfiend> omg, do not mention FireFly
[1:07:13] <AncelDeLambert> he's explaining the FF7 issue
[1:07:13] <surmarcodepolo> Dramatic transformer readings sounds dope
[1:07:15] <%xana0908> Facts
[1:07:20] <ASkeleton> @BallerSwagBro9k And that's not my entire collection
[1:07:24] <+Glitchesarecool> Dragon Megatron was one of the best models they ever made
[1:07:29] <agadejobi> CYBORGS DON'T FEEL PAIN. I DO. DON'T DO THAT AGAIN
[1:07:30] <+FlipsVsTheWorld> Some scenes i nt1 do not hold up at all LUL
[1:07:34] <AncelDeLambert> ie "we keep telling you it's good, Zoomer, shut up about the graphics and just PLAY IT"
[1:07:35] <+AnActualFrog> Well that's good, because Sarah would have wrecked his shit.
[1:07:36] <%irisillych> @Glitchesarecool if you start binging that i'll die
[1:07:38] <$Essixian> @surmarcodepolo Especially of those comics. They're quite the read. Kappa

[1:07:54] <+ChillTonic> Ya yoo yaa yoooooo
[1:07:59] <+JavaManJoJo> but the opening rap is a bop
[1:07:59] <Zebroneath> One Piece's anime pacing killed the enjoyment for me.
[1:08:17] <+Artemis_Scowl> "DREAMIN Dont give it up Luffy!"
[1:08:24] <+benija> Wow, havent thought about beast wars in a long time.
[1:08:27] <+Aeogard> pokemon gun
[1:08:30] <KitsuneManami> New Pokemon's Gou is trash, worst Pokemon character
[1:08:34] <%irisillych> 4Kids up until Fox Kids was DECENT
[1:08:34] <f2ai> All the episodes I caught of 4Kids One Piece looked like a flipbook
[1:08:35] <agadejobi> Charmeleon!
[1:08:36] <+Underfiend> ...then DK craps all over everyrthing
[1:08:36] <+ChillTonic> 4Kids did an AMAZING dub of Ultimate Muscle, but I can't forgive them for One Piece.
[1:08:40] <agadejobi> Wartortle!
[1:08:40] <$Kurudan> never gonna get over the "jelly donuts" thing. i believed them for yeeeears

[1:08:50] <KitsuneManami> Soo You wanna be a Pokemon master! UaHAhAhAh!
[1:08:51] <$Essixian> 4Kids are fucking villains for not airing that episode of Pokemon where everyone's in swimsuits and James has tits for some reason.
[1:08:52] <ASkeleton> The god damn pokemon rap
[1:08:54] <+Aeogard> 4k one piece opening though
[1:08:57] <%BobtheMongoose> The Pokemon Company International now handles the dubbing, and that's a good thing :)
[1:08:58] <agadejobi> AERO-DAC-TYAL
[1:09:00] <Kutakai666> oops

[1:09:23] <agadejobi> Paige's bagel madness coming in here too?
[1:09:24] <+benija> What if he just likes liking things? Nothing wrong with that.
[1:09:27] <KitsuneManami> DO YOU LIKE WAFFLES!?
[1:09:30] <KitsuneManami> YEA I LIKE WAFFLES
[1:09:31] <Kazuhira_Boat> Everyone knows that 4kids true masterpiece is the Eva intro
[1:09:31] <+tweedler92> Paige is super right
[1:09:31] <+Aeogard> pat is right yet again
[1:09:31] <$Midashu> Waffles are amazing
[1:09:32] <+typezn6> it's not about bagels. it's the cr√©ame cheese.
[1:09:32] <$BallerSwagBro9k> PANCAKES MASTER RACE LUL
[1:09:32] <%Varlinator> oh boy. here we go

[1:09:34] <DotDusk> üò°
[1:09:34] <+Glitchesarecool> waffles are vastly superior when done right
[1:09:36] <+RedDeadApple> Its a mood thing for waffles or pancakes
[1:09:37] <%BobtheMongoose> Waffles are better pattiiREE
[1:09:37] <$Essixian> THEY'RE BOTH GREAT IN DIFFERENT CONTEXTS
[1:09:38] <+around_40_jobbers> Pat! apatDab
[1:09:38] <%Bass1015> Pancakes are better
[1:09:43] <%FrenchGucho> pancake is just a soggy waffle
[1:09:43] <Edgy_raven> Crepes tho
[1:09:43] <vergil44> Everyone has the right to be wrong lets leave it at that
[1:09:47] <Lamourafox> best breakfast food is coffee
[1:09:48] <$BallerSwagBro9k> BREAKFAST RACE WAR BEGINS NOW

[1:09:52] <+sgtgeneralcog> belgium waffles
[1:09:54] <+around_40_jobbers> Waffles are vastly superior to Pancakes
[1:09:54] <+FightingFenghuang> i mean pancake does have cake in the name
[1:09:57] <Zebroneath> Pancakes are incredible
[1:09:57] <+FightingFenghuang> how do you top that?
[1:10:01] <ASkeleton> Pancakes all the way, not American ones though they're too small
[1:10:02] <Cute_Arsonist> Team PANCAKES!
[1:10:03] <agadejobi> I'm unsubscribing from Super Bunny Hop
[1:10:05] <$workingwater0> Pancakes are so much better and are fluffy
[1:10:08] <KitsuneManami> Doo Doo Dod do Just Wanna take a Mouth Full!
[1:10:10] <$BallerSwagBro9k> LUL
[1:10:10] <Kutakai666> Splatoon 2 had a splatfest on this. I think waffle won.
[1:10:10] <+Glitchesarecool> @ballerswagbro9k woolie doesn't believe in breakfast
[1:10:11] <AsterBodhran> I hate this
[1:10:14] <+AnActualFrog> OH OK
[1:10:15] <+LeoDrakoniX> FRENCH TOAST IS AWESOME
[1:10:15] <surmarcodepolo> waffle is better than pancakes end of discussion

[1:10:20] <booterdagg> Paige murdering fools
[1:10:23] <%irisillych> waffles are crispy and have flavor pockets
[1:10:27] <+FightingFenghuang> waffles did win
[1:10:29] <+Aeogard> man that background looks so nice @QuietteShy
[1:10:33] <$BallerSwagBro9k> @Glitchesarecool Woolie is insane
[1:10:33] <%Fox__Populi> american waffle is better then american pancake, however belgian or hungarian pancake is better then any kind of waffle
[1:10:34] <KitsuneManami> Sing the Song!
[1:10:37] <%croxeye> waffle House>>>>>>>>>>>>any pancake place
[1:10:42] <Fujiwara_92> so waffles
[1:10:44] <astickfarmer> "what it is is:" stream freezes
[1:10:47] <+Bane_Kaikyo> If a Waffle became a Paladin it would be a LAWFUL WAFFLE
[1:10:51] <%irisillych> pancakes are just cake you need to sweeten yourself
[1:10:52] <+around_40_jobbers> chocolate is cheating!
[1:10:52] <+Glitchesarecool> I like the crispy of the waffles more often than pancakes
[1:10:52] <+AnActualFrog> you have my attention
[1:10:53] <agadejobi> I have a gluten intolerance, so I can't even eat this crap anymore
[1:10:57] <jayswordsman> Bacon pancales
[1:10:58] <+ChillTonic> 1 cup flour, one cup milk, bit of salt, that's IT. Perfect Pancakes.
[1:11:01] <risenlp2> Thanks for the HahaTurtledove @croxeye
[1:11:04] <Lamourafox> choclate pancakes with peanut butter topping
[1:11:04] <%fistopher> put the toppings inside to cheat waffles LUL
[1:11:09] <Fujiwara_92> waffle bagel >>>>>>>>>>>>>> pancake
[1:11:10] <ECRead> eat a real Belgian waffle I beg you
[1:11:11] <zeox91> Third war started by a pancake argument
[1:11:16] <ASkeleton> Chunky or smooth?
[1:11:19] <$Essixian> Paige's favorite pancake is made by going away from pancakes as possible
[1:11:21] <AsterBodhran> Insane mustard goblin has other incorrect opinions as well
[1:11:22] <+benija> "I love pancakes" Proceeds to smother it in things to not taste the pancakes
[1:11:24] <Lamourafox> chicken and waffles
[1:11:25] <Wanted_Tiger> so uhh.....glyphs when Roz ?
[1:11:27] <KitsuneManami> STAB IT LIKE A UNBORN CHILD!
[1:11:29] <%Bass1015> Pancakes are better cause all you need is a pan, you need some weird waffle iron thing to make a waffle
[1:11:29] <agadejobi> I actually haven't had breakfast food in years
[1:11:32] <$Essixian> @ChillTonic No eggs, you savage?!
[1:11:32] <%BobtheMongoose> Because waffle is meant to be a Crispy delicious thing, Not a big poofy pancake thing.
[1:11:36] <@Roz_Lynd> when you redeem it @Wanted_Tiger
[1:11:36] <%irisillych> SYRUP TOO??
[1:11:39] <biollantelive> the only advantage pancakes have on waffles is that they can be sweet or savory. love me some ham and cheese pancakes.
[1:11:41] <%irisillych> jesus my teeth hurt
[1:11:41] <+AnActualFrog> This is some Iron Chef shit.
[1:11:43] <%Varlinator> She's gonna end this recipe with: "And then you drown it mustard!"
[1:11:43] <%fistopher> poor man's waffle LUL
[1:11:45] <KitsuneManami> Lewd
[1:11:45] <$Midashu> Soggy Pancakes
[1:11:46] <+around_40_jobbers> Make sure it has holes... like... yknow... a waffle
[1:11:47] <%actualramifications> To be fair, a lot of things become better when stabbing is involved
[1:11:47] <Shishi1205> stab it like paige would stab a woman
[1:11:48] <DotDusk> D:
[1:11:48] <%wattyven> "Like a slutty little sponge"
[1:11:48] <khornescabbages> LUL
[1:11:49] <$BallerSwagBro9k> @KitsuneManami Or another woman for paige LUL
[1:11:50] <simulationbard> So like a waffle
[1:11:52] <Fujiwara_92> sluty sponge?
[1:11:54] <ASkeleton> CHUNKY OR SMOOTH
[1:11:54] <%Varlinator> in mustard
[1:11:58] <Wanted_Tiger> @Roz_Lynd Bruh
[1:12:00] <+LeoDrakoniX> OH MY
[1:12:02] <%Typhaeon> So it's a fluffier waffle
[1:12:03] <KitsuneManami> @BallerSwagBro9k Thats the Joke
[1:12:03] <Kung_Fu_KaiTV> I'm late the stream, but has Pat said something stupid yet? Kappa
[1:12:04] <Zebroneath> Paige's Slutty Pancakes *TM
[1:12:04] <$Essixian> Slutty sponge ele5LEWD
[1:12:05] <vergil44> So get rid the pancake completely and eat e bunch of other sweet shit
[1:12:07] <electricpig408> fruity pebbles is the best breakfast
[1:12:11] <+rider_megalon> that's a sandwich at this point
[1:12:16] <ravik75> if you stab a pancake doesnt it technically make it a waffle?
[1:12:17] <PizzaGirlMaria> a pancake with holes is just a pancake trying to be a waffle!
[1:12:18] <%Pesuto> Does someone have a shutup DK? OpieOP
[1:12:19] <+AnActualFrog> At that point, it is indistinguishable from the wafffle.
[1:12:21] <+tweedler92> Waffle is too crunchy
[1:12:23] <sasparillatango> Paige just wants syrup and btter melted together and to drink that
[1:12:30] <+Glitchesarecool> that's too much topping
[1:12:32] <KitsuneManami> From Beast Wars to Waffles/Pancakes
[1:12:33] <+ChillTonic> @Essixian Dammit, I ALWAYS forget the egg.
[1:12:35] <KitsuneManami> XD
[1:12:38] <AncelDeLambert> a good pancake is a fluffy airy pillow on your plate
[1:12:38] <+around_40_jobbers> @Pesuto I'm working toward it PepeHands
[1:12:40] <+CryoCheese> she shouldnt have made the argument of base taste being overwhelmed by toppings LUL that is pretty void
[1:12:41] <+Glitchesarecool> just drink the syrup straight
[1:12:43] <Kutakai666> miasGasm
[1:12:55] <Fujiwara_92> just have a waffle, that way you don't need to put holes in pancakes
[1:12:56] <$Essixian> @ChillTonic You are forgiven for now.
[1:13:01] <xxterminatorviixx> Waffles for me
[1:13:04] <$workingwater0> But you can bake chocolate chips and M&Ms into pancakes
[1:13:17] <+around_40_jobbers> PogChamp
[1:13:17] <zeox91> Better than pancakes... empanadas of meat

[1:15:49] <biollantelive> warhammer 40k lore is what happens when a bunch of 70s UK punk rock and scifi nerds write a satire and after some writer turnovers eventually people lose track of the fact that it's a satire and try to take it seriously, at which point it becomes even more ridiculous.
[1:15:52] <+recklessone42> God of Excess
[1:15:58] <surmarcodepolo> didn't slaanesh get fucked?

[1:19:34] <+recklessone42> You don't need melee when you have the best guns in the game
[1:19:35] <%actualramifications> I think there is a lot of conceptual bleedover to warframe from w40k, not that it's bad
[1:19:36] <$Essixian> @dukenux They've got the Kroot for that, they know they strengths and weaknesses.
[1:19:38] <dukenux> Warframecraft
[1:19:41] <R3Roundabout> Railjack is way too grindy to get into now

[1:20:34] <+goliath013> You can solo it with only archwing actually.

[1:21:01] <%actualramifications> Team element is what makes railjack fun
[1:21:03] <TheFranss> Hosts in Railjack should have some level of veto on their hands

[1:22:09] <KitsuneManami> Warframe would Kill her...
[1:22:09] <+vapetrail> Blaze at high level you combine the Forward Artillery with the Apocs armour strip, lets you 1 or 2 shot the crewships
[1:22:10] <TheFranss> 4th guy is pretty much the maintenance / security role

[1:24:21] <Kutakai666> I've found myself being the berserker engineer. I keep the ship running then go and sabotage the enemy.
[1:24:21] <Zarozian> SENTIENTS!
[1:24:23] <$Essixian> @ASkeleton And Saryn, and Ivara, and Nova, and Valkyr, and Garuda...
[1:24:23] <+Aeogard> they are slightly above average at least
[1:24:31] <KitsuneManami> @Aeogard go watch Shy's Mesa Prime vids
[1:24:32] <%actualramifications> I fix all the stuff and forge all the revolite, then go back to forward artillery
[1:24:33] <Zarozian> We need 30 million damage for SENTIENTS!
[1:24:35] <Edgy_raven> wndurance weapons are more about status ticks than crit damage
[1:24:37] <AncelDeLambert> oh god seven hours

[1:26:00] <+Aeogard> warframe is minecraft? :OO
[1:26:03] <$Essixian> I've found that the journey is almost always more satisfying than the destination in most games, especially anything that has RPG-esque stat and ability progression.

[1:47:59] <$Essixian> @Nero9341 @chubbypencil That's actually a good non-shitpost idea.
[1:48:03] <LeftOverPizza13> fun fact alcohol was once used to fuel torpedos
[1:48:03] <AncelDeLambert> eww, Jack
[1:48:08] <wakito64> Oh no
[1:48:08] <$workingwater0> What type of markers are those @quietteshy ?
[1:48:10] <%actualramifications> nooooo
[1:48:11] <$Midashu> ugh
[1:48:12] <DrozZombie> gross
[1:48:12] <AncelDeLambert> so... whiskey and whiskey?
[1:48:13] <+Glitchesarecool> that sounds bad
[1:48:16] <ECRead> that sounds gross
[1:48:16] <+PenmanLupine> probably made before 9/11
[1:48:18] <%Varlinator> Bud Light? ohnPuke
[1:48:18] <dukenux> does that drink dates from before 9/11
[1:48:27] <fruit_pie_the_magician> You'd have to do two of those
[1:48:28] <ThirdPersonPhil> if you make your drink name controversial enough i guess people will talk about it eh
[1:48:31] <Fujiwara_92> a 9/11 would have some arabic drink in it Kappa
[1:48:46] <LeftOverPizza13> bud light DansGame
[1:48:53] <$Essixian> Are there actually any GOOD american beers?
[1:49:06] <ECRead> Tennessee fire and apple cider is good
[1:49:09] <ephemeralMichael> craft beers
[1:49:15] <%Razputin217> Sam Adams?
[1:49:15] <AncelDeLambert> I dunno, my beer tastes are weird
[1:49:16] <PylonDogg> All the yanks keep telling me their craft beers are good.
[1:49:19] <%irisillych> i shouldn't drink, so when i do it's in the daytime
[1:49:20] <Kutakai666> Vermont Heavy Topper?
[1:49:21] <AncelDeLambert> I like Steel Reserve
[1:49:21] <fruit_pie_the_magician> I don't always drink bee, but when I do, I put oranges in it
[1:49:22] <ephemeralMichael> depends on ur local brewer
[1:49:31] <$Midashu> Blue Moon is one of the better choices
[1:49:37] <+LeoDrakoniX> Redd's Apple Ale is good tbh
[1:49:37] <Kain5707> its so good
[1:49:40] <%actualramifications> pale ales turn unpleasant due to sunlight exposure - and sourness rescues them
[1:49:44] <+pee_foam> my favorite is ginger beer and rum
[1:49:45] <zercikato> I like Sake drinks
[1:49:45] <dukenux> Shandy, no
[1:49:46] <wsintai> Blue Moon is just nice and smooth
[1:49:47] <%BobtheMongoose> It's an insult to piss water to call Bud Light piss water

[1:51:22] <$workingwater0> If you ever want a sweet and fruity drink try mixing sprite and root beer together, sounds weird but trust me it‚Äôs really good
[1:51:31] <dukenux> "you see RLM crew drink this" Dan Aykroyd's Crystall Skull vodka?

[1:53:24] <%actualramifications> Lemon juice has sugar in it!
[1:53:27] <wsintai> Lemon Mustard Juice
[1:53:32] <+ZENmanANUBIS> sort of like how salad is great, just don't add salad dressing.
[1:53:33] <FromThe70s> No Mustard SAYS 0 Calories on it, but the serving size is measured in atomic weight
[1:53:33] <dukenux> it is
[1:53:34] <+mosseon> how do you get lemon juice and mustard mixed up?
[1:53:34] <PizzaFeline_> lemon mustard juice
[1:53:36] <Fujiwara_92> LEMON JUICE IS JUICE
[1:53:36] <+mosseon> HOW
[1:53:37] <$BallerSwagBro9k> @irisillych Well Pat probably transferred it to her by now LUL

[1:53:56] <TheFranss> both are yellow. Are we onto something here chat=?
[1:53:57] <$Essixian> Paige, if you like mustard you have to try swedish or danish christmas-style mustard. It's spicy yellow heaven. Johnny's Sk√•nsk is a good choice.
[1:53:57] <%irisillych> crazy talk has effected everyone in pat's radius
[1:54:00] <+BubbaRands> Lemon mustard paste
[1:54:01] <ThirdPersonPhil> a condiment to surpass Metal Gear
[1:54:01] <zeox91> Cherrys
[1:54:07] <Lenmutt> Pickle Juice is the best
[1:54:08] <+SweepTheLegoMyEggo> Paige loves mustard and lemon juice on her bagels
[1:54:11] <$Midashu> If a serving size ends up being somewhere below 1 calorie manufacturers are allowed to label a product as "zero calories".
[1:54:12] <PizzaFeline_> lemon pickle mustard juice?
[1:54:16] <%RavenTheXeno> pickle juice is good
[1:54:17] <$Essixian> Pickle juice zoeyEgg
[1:54:17] <+ZENmanANUBIS> milk is notoriously not good with lemons.
[1:54:23] <DrozZombie> o god
[1:54:25] <Kutakai666> Pickle juice is pretty all right.
[1:54:33] <%EyeInTheNight> yeah we have a good one in sweden
[1:54:46] <ShichiNoBushi> KiloCalorie
[1:54:53] <+xshyax> HahaBall
[1:54:55] <PizzaFeline_> bruh
[1:55:05] <Tactical_Fatty> Sugar is listed in grams because its considered a "Liquid" Ingredient
[1:55:11] <+JavaManJoJo> that's why things like tic tacs are allowed to say sugar free when they're basically only sugar, iirc
[1:55:15] <DagstarTV> if you're having more than a kilo of sugar a day, pretty sure you got dibeetus

[1:55:22] <+chiluzza> Pickle juice i use in my chili to give it a little extra kick
[1:55:23] <DagstarTV> or will do soon
[1:55:26] <Lenmutt> there is so much sugar in so many foods
[1:55:27] <AncelDeLambert> sure thing, Pat
[1:55:29] <Fujiwara_92> why is it confusing? grams to kilos... it's easy
[1:55:33] <ShichiNoBushi> We use ounces.
[1:55:36] <%sshen> Sugar good salt bad according to them

[1:58:07] <Fujiwara_92> the moon diet... eat until you're the size of the moon
[1:58:09] <$Essixian> @grandtour11 Preach! People need to stop thinking that eating more or less of one specific thing will solve all their problems.
[1:58:09] <+BubbaRands> Eat whatever you want, just not all of it.
[1:58:15] <fairore> @pylondogg cmonBruh
[1:58:27] <DrozZombie> ppl say fat is bad .........no your brain kinda runs on the good form of fat
[1:58:34] <PizzaFeline_> sun diet, eat until you're breathing fire
[1:58:36] <%Tactical_Fatty> Im on the "Eat whatever the feck you want cause I got too many weight gain problems to lose weight so fuck it"
[1:58:38] <ThirdPersonPhil> not a diet... so its a Cult?
[1:58:40] <%Tactical_Fatty> Diet
[1:58:42] <%wattyven> @grandtour11 water only diet uwu
[1:58:49] <%Pesuto> Balanced diet and be aware of how much you consume of just *one* thing. My uncle passed aware due to cancer, which he obtained from heavy drinking as a young man while working as a building constructor
[1:58:52] <ECRead> I just eat whatever. As long as I do something physical I'm good. but I'm also a big guy.

[1:59:31] <$Essixian> @TheFranss There's honey in it, but it's a LOT spicier than the kind of honey mustard you get in america. The mustard is also nowhere near as finely ground. Google "sk√•nsk senap" and you'll see examples.

[1:59:51] <$Billzhuang> Everyone's body are different. Gotta check with a doc to choose the right one for you. Even too much water can cause death. Just look up "Hold Your Wee for a Wii Challenge" You also gotta change your diet from time to time. Having the same diet forever causes the body to get used to it so workouts can become less effect. Again, check with a doc to see the best diet. Kappa1337
