[0:00:18] <%grandtour11> Hi everyone!
[0:00:20] <@Lardcat> quiettCry Hey folks, Shy's in a little bit of a pickle and needs some help. quiettCry She's lost the use of her art stream PC and is raising funds to cover its replacement. If you feel like contributing anything at all to this cause, every little bit helps. quiettCash Now don't feel compelled or obligated, that's not how this works. Don't spend into debt for Shy; if ya don't have spare munz, don't fret or worry about it.

[0:38:18] <+rdark_ksu> Southern Illinois aint south. Peach I grew up in southern Kansas and I aint south. You mean rural. We are VERY rural.
[0:38:21] <Zedimonx5> Illinois doesn‚Äôt exist Paige....
[0:38:22] <$Ella_Mental> I used to live in Edwardsville IL, near the St. Louis area. Considered it MID-Midwest. :p

[0:39:12] <@SarahTsang> I love mid western accents
[0:39:18] <war6425> she's mad moxxie
[0:39:20] <+Mistheart101> Paige you don't have a straight accent, you have a bi one
[0:39:20] <+meltdown547> That accent is just rural in general. Central/Upstate NY more or less also gets into that range.
[0:39:21] <%Heartnail> WARSH THE CORR
[0:39:24] <%irisillych> that's Midwest,

[0:45:07] <321Continue> Paige playing football sounds scary, because she'd 1 kick your ass because she's big n strong and 2 would fucking explode because Lupus
[0:45:08] <+storebrandcandy> What happens if a penguin waddles onto the ice and just steals the puck? I assume this is a real concern.
[0:45:08] <+Flamefish345> Did Portland have a ton of Nazi's?

[0:45:42] <lewdskeletor13> Of course you like football because of the dancing LUL
[0:45:46] <+Mittensbro> THE POINT IS THAT THEY'RE NOT SPORTSMANLIKE

[0:46:10] <+lode1> @Razputin217 UrinatingTree has a ongoing series called This Week in Sportsball.
[0:46:12] <+commanderclaw> Yeah, there's strict rules about what they're allowed to do
[0:46:17] <MachetePhD> Sports-fanaticism is part of why I was scared about the idea of England winning the world cup last year. On the one hand- Pride and support the team. On the other hand, people get rowdier and rowdier with each victory, if we won... There'd be riots of people overjoyed about it. London would be on fire... Again!
[0:46:18] <+lacronton> its all Delay Of Game
[0:46:20] <@SarahTsang> @Flamefish345 yeah let's not bring that in to chat !
[0:46:27] <+Mittensbro> THE FACT THAT THEY'RE NOT SPORTSMANLIKE IS THE BEST PART

[1:35:42] <@SarahTsang> ;O
[1:35:49] <%MachetePhD> @Kiyoske Yikes bo8S
[1:35:50] <+rdark_ksu> okay so I need to give up my hobby of having ppl sneeze in my face. Darn
[1:35:50] <Lenmutt> I love I enter this stream and this is what they are talking about, nice Paige.
[1:35:55] <+walternatorz> You're kissing air.
[1:35:59] <$321Continue> MonoSaliva?
[1:36:00] <%Heartnail> "You can catch it from the fucking" is a Pat line
[1:36:00] <+Mittensbro> perhaps some kind of peach saliva thing
[1:36:04] <Deekman> Lemme eat your liver when you‚Äôre done. I‚Äôm trying to get mono
[1:36:09] <+skizzuto> you make little saliva droplets whenever you cough/sneeze
[1:36:13] <Zedimonx5> Does Pat have mono?!
[1:36:15] <%theSLiKbandit> time to stay chaste lest I catch the mono Keepo
[1:36:40] <CyberneticSusurrus> Is 'cause coughing & sneezing expels droplets of saliva into the air.
[1:36:43] <Lenmutt> Sounds super kinky.
[1:36:45] <+rdark_ksu> for the god damn longest time I thought it was Peach Salvia and thought you were a druggie. Took a while
[1:36:46] <CrimsonViper_> sure you didnt Kappa
[1:36:48] <typo114> i wanted to be in first place so i am now mono y mano
[1:36:52] <$321Continue> PeachSaliva is sexual?
[1:36:58] <%Heartnail> I still remember when Paige got that one tweet and she was like "wait what?"
[1:37:00] <@SarahTsang> I just thought it was a cute name
[1:37:02] <AncelDeLambert> hey, Paige, at least your username is marketable. Mine can't be used for jack shit.
[1:37:06] <%Altomare3> Peach Salvia is the way to go
[1:37:17] <%KevinsLunchbox> PeachSaliva is better than the actual pornstar name she used to use
[1:37:18] <%rivenscry42> "I could eat a peach for hours"
[1:37:21] <+rdark_ksu> I'm not a big fan of peaches the fruit.
[1:37:22] <%theSLiKbandit> it might be a Cry thing
[1:37:22] <%Bass1015> Kryoz?

[1:39:51] <Solidus_113> proxy paige is the porn one IIRC
[1:39:55] <+skizzuto> it's fine, we just beat off to Pat instead
[1:40:00] <+MagicalGnome> That was the perfect description of everyone I have met from Montreal
[1:40:01] <$321Continue> "dumb hat" Paige you're wearing a McDonald's bag on your head

[1:40:21] <+rdark_ksu> Paige if it makes you feel better I, a totally straight man would be more likely to beat it to Pats stream than yours.
[1:40:29] <masterhall117> That‚Äôs cool
[1:40:43] <@SarahTsang> @rdark_ksu that's really romantic
[1:41:13] <$321Continue> @rdark_ksu I agree with that notion
[1:41:14] <%KevinsLunchbox> Better Paige is better than Paige just like how PlagueofGripes is better Pat
[1:41:24] <Fenrir_TSS> there is betterwoolie a betterpaige but is there a betterpat?
[1:41:26] <gsoto83> Its hard to say based on the sample size of time that shes been on the stream
[1:41:27] <CrimsonViper_> oh no san francisco
[1:41:42] <hsojson> the drawing looks sick af dawg
[1:41:44] <+commanderclaw> No, Rich Evans is better Pat

[1:43:00] <cosplaydemei> !giveaways
[1:43:00] <@Lardcat> We have multiple giveaways during each Art Stream as we are ready for them. Giveaways will open and announce an entry phrase which you then just type in chat once. The phrase is different each time so pay attention. You'll need to wait about 10 min before a winner is announced. If that's too much for you to handle, join the discord server and try there. Stay tuned and good luck.
[1:43:24] <+critfumble_> woolie has assumed the mantle of petter woolie, freeing brennen from the curse
[1:43:50] <KTDelgado> woolie has evolved tho
[1:43:55] <+critfumble_> better*
[1:43:57] <typo114> "identity theft is a serious crime Jim!"
[1:44:04] <%KevinsLunchbox> thats right, Woolie is proper Woolie now. I forgot. Now he just needs to defeat his Father, Original Woolie in combat to assume full power.
[1:44:08] <PipiKakaChuchu> Rich is taken, by Macaulay Culkin
[1:44:13] <gsoto83> Now brennen has become his rival, DIO MADDEN!
[1:44:25] <+rdark_ksu> he said something pretty apt "i wish I was always dead" and thats just my life
[1:44:26] <alrobot2014> and now woolie creates woolies and spreads them to the world through his power

[1:53:28] <mark_collins45> I saw Patton at a grocery store in Los Angeles yesterday. I told him how cool it was to meet him in person, but I didn‚Äôt want to be a douche and bother him and ask him for photos or anything. He said, ‚ÄúOh, like you‚Äôre doing now?‚Äù I was taken aback, and all I could say was ‚ÄúHuh?‚Äù but he kept cutting me off and going ‚Äúhuh? huh? huh?‚Äù and closing his hand shut in front of my face. I walked away and continued with my shopping, and I heard him chuckle as I walked off.

[2:09:06] <Lenmutt> You see Papyrus tomorrow right Paige? biggest tease.
[2:09:27] <$Varlinator> Deltarune is a solid 5 or so hours long
[2:09:33] <$Varlinator> It's a good time
[2:09:34] <%KevinsLunchbox> I'm terrible at dodging the enemy attacks so I got to Temmie village and didn't go passed it
[2:09:40] <%norgthefish> Game works fine but you can't delete it

[2:10:07] <$Varlinator> Also RUDE BUSTER is a banger!
[2:10:11] <+JavaManJoJo> iirc that only happened if you used the uninstaller that it came with. Plus I think that has been patched by now
[2:10:21] <@Lardcat> quiettBob If you wish to support Shy by purchasing one of her prints, you can find them here: https://redbubble.com/people/quietteshy/ .

[2:10:44] <+JavaManJoJo> Also I think you can play Deltarune on your Switch now?
[2:10:44] <Lenmutt> Paige emotionally manipulated Goat mom before killing her.... Shame.
[2:10:47] <%grandtour11> I killed tauriel at the start and had to restart and i felt so bad and flowey taunted me for it and i cried
