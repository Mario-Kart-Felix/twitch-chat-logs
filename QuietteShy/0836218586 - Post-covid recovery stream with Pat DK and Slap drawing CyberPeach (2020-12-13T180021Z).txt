[0:03:09] <Saltmeisterr> hello i am here for the pat
[0:03:22] <+Cheese_Moon> Sunsetting means the gear you got cannot be upgraded after a point

[0:03:50] <big_tittie_anime_gf> I was wondering why all my shit had turned to 1050 next season
[0:03:52] <+Cheese_Moon> so that you *must* grind the new stuff
[0:03:52] <AntiCaesar> sunsetting isn't inheritenly bad, but for destiny is not healthy

[0:05:50] <AntiCaesar> how bad was the plague
[0:05:51] <montecati> ok
[0:05:58] <sjost11> pvp needs to actually be balanced and stasis needs to be tweaked to not freeze my guts every 0.5 seconds

[0:06:24] <@Lardcat> quiettArtist Today, Shy is drawing, Paige aka PeachSaliva in the fashion of Cyberpunk! Please enjoy! quiettArtist
[0:06:32] <%green_daemon> any game that keeps PVE and PVP with the same balance and gear-set has always been super hamstrung
[0:06:34] <Saltmeisterr> just make pvp balance seperate from pve balance?
[0:06:35] <$travakh> They "cound" separate balancing of weapons in PVP/PVE in Destiny like Warframe does with its PVP having diff stats for weapons & frames
[0:06:39] <$travakh> *could

[0:06:40] <Saltmeisterr> that seems pretty eady
[0:06:47] <Stepmans22> should've just disabled ultimates in pvp
[0:06:49] <AntiCaesar> see in halo, bungie didnt care if a weapon was useless in pvp or pve (automatics)
[0:06:49] <@Rozalyndis> we got 3 hours to cover
[0:06:55] <%blistexthief> Thanks for the 2020SpeakUp @arcgeist
[0:07:03] <Archangel735> oooh we're going there
[0:07:04] <+jaydon2286> Hello
[0:07:08] <@Rozalyndis> my thoughts are easy: it's not impressive
[0:07:09] <BroMo15> YO IS THAT THE ONE AND ONLY SLAAAAAAP?! HERE!? WOAH!? saraht2AHH
[0:07:19] <BinaryBetrayer> If only half of CDPR hadn't left mid development of Witcher 3
[0:07:20] <+michingmallecho> On pc, I like it hasKapp
[0:07:26] <%toxic_waltzz> The bugs are just surprise features
[0:07:36] <weirdee> well nobody else wanted to hear my thoughts, and that's why i'm depressed rn
[0:07:40] <+JeanGardner99> enjoying cyberpunk but it definitely needed more time in the oven
[0:07:41] <+boxofmango> slapin here whaa
[0:07:42] <weirdee> lol
[0:07:43] <UserjokeBoy> well gello there
[0:07:44] <%TWolfJaeger> You're better? Huzzah!
[0:07:44] <aphrafen> Very glad you are feeling better, tiny Shyling
[0:08:07] <arvidonfire> This is giving me cozy Co-Optional Podcast vibes and that also gives me memories of TotalBiscuit :(
[0:08:08] <$reedkage> Hi Shy, just wanted to congratulate you on recovering from Covid. As someone who also caught it, I can sympathize what it's like and I'm happy you beat it
[0:08:08] <@Rozalyndis> i'm over here
[0:08:12] <AntiCaesar> I think I have the plague rn and it isnt pleasant but not miserable so far
[0:08:17] <+MayorRev> helllooooooo
[0:08:18] <@Rozalyndis> andyCry i'm invisible
[0:08:29] <~QuietteShy> im about 35 hours in
[0:08:31] <AntiCaesar> @reedkage how bad was it for you?
[0:08:37] <+MayorRev> how we all doing?
[0:08:38] <+UberWolfman> I see you Roz kmaCozy
[0:08:42] <fatalrfjl> Helloooo, happy for your recovery Shy 😊💕
[0:08:48] <MoonWatcher21> Yo
[0:08:48] <BroMo15> >.>
[0:08:51] <Archangel735> @reedkage how ya feeling?
[0:08:54] <%TWolfJaeger> I have 70 hours in, and just realized I made the wrong choice about 15 hours ago and I'm internally seething.
[0:09:02] <%r3dray88> I honestly don't care, I'm disappointed that all the bugs are there but I'm not there to be a "game journalist" or suggest it to the world but I like it for myself
[0:09:04] <%Arcgeist> Kinda wondered how she contracted Covid.
[0:09:08] <+MayorRev> So the customized dick thing is real?
[0:09:14] <%PretzelRocks> Now Playing: Rise by Occams Laser -> https://prtzl.io/oLHawoDwO5Yv9kFg
[0:09:18] <BinaryBetrayer> Apparently RUINER was made by former CDPR people who left because of the crunch and development hell. It really activates your almonds when you think about it.
[0:09:26] <+Promessa_EX> It’s actually Skyrim 2
[0:09:27] <montecati> I have covid 3 months ago, and it's a s***
[0:09:30] <@Rozalyndis> some idiot did a ritual sacrifice the wrong way and the energies made her sick @Arcgeist
[0:09:31] <weirdee> dick classic or dick 2
[0:09:32] <$reedkage> @AntiCaesar @Archangel735 like the worst case of the flu I ever had, I was bedridden for a week. I've recovered with no apparent lingering effects that I can tell
[0:09:34] <+MayorRev> RUINER is epic
[0:09:34] <fatalrfjl> @mayorrev yes, it's real LOL
[0:09:42] <Archangel735> RUINER was fucking awesome
[0:09:43] <+MayorRev> surprised that it was made by former devs wow
[0:09:44] <$BallerSwagBro9k> its not that bad lol

[0:10:26] <Garthunox> Hey Shy, glad to hear you beat Covid!
[0:10:29] <%xCaseZ> Thanks for the 2020Pajamas @billzhuang
[0:10:32] <weirdee> i think the game was forced out because the gamers were angry and the execs were angry that the gamers were angry
[0:10:48] <paristhemeow> NYOOM
[0:10:48] <+SomeOne2512> I got Covid right now Shy so if you can survive so can I lol
[0:10:51] <weirdee> but as we know, the corpos always have to have their way
[0:10:56] <alyssithe> @Billzhuang oh fuck hey thanks
[0:11:01] <+Promessa_EX> Why do bad games need 11 years of crunch
[0:11:02] <BinaryBetrayer> Cops teleporting behind you, people using your parked car as a soda vending machine, Quantum cars, brainless driving AI...
[0:11:07] <Archangel735> just goes to show how crunch doesnt help at all
[0:11:09] <+MayorRev> ahahahaha i saw that
[0:11:10] <+JeanGardner99> yeah figure they were forced to put something out or risk nothing coming out
[0:11:13] <big_tittie_anime_gf> I am going to wait for it to be fixed to get it and i wish everyone waited for the reviews to come in
[0:11:13] <TheSwordFish123> I feel like bugs will be well before that but finishing the content like the ai etc will most likely be then
[0:11:13] <fatalrfjl> @weirdee yeah, I think the same, the felt the pressure of realising it
[0:11:18] <+michingmallecho> Well the dick clipping is not a bug...it’s a feature
[0:11:21] <+MayorRev> There's a gltich that leaves your fly open
[0:11:28] <Archangel735> AI driving reminds me of Halo AI driving lol
[0:11:29] <+MayorRev> freeballing
[0:11:42] <%TWolfJaeger> CDPR straight up isn't handling working from home effectively.
[0:11:51] <bomi1995> peach looks extra cute
[0:11:52] <$Billzhuang> Games not as glitchy as a lot of people are making it out to be tbh. the PS4 and XbOne editions have the most for some reason, while PC and the new gen consoles do just fine (minues some engine glitches and level/ai design). Been at it for 50 hours. Game works pretty consistend for some reason. Stealth and melee is shit though Kappa1337
[0:11:54] <Billzhuang> Billzhuang's Cheer shared rewards to 25 others in Chat! 
[0:11:59] <+Promessa_EX> Yeah making ai not be able to drive is the classic “who gives a shit” game design
[0:12:00] <BinaryBetrayer> You wouldn't download a cop
[0:12:01] <+storebrandcandy> only cops have access to warp technology
[0:12:07] <$BallerSwagBro9k> YUP
[0:12:11] <+michingmallecho> Robot cops...always watching. Always
[0:12:14] <$BallerSwagBro9k> TELEPORT
[0:12:14] <Hoot_Patoots> how cool that i got a cyberpunk ad just before joining
[0:12:16] <%PretzelRocks> Now Playing: Loose Change by Zinc LeMone -> https://prtzl.io/oLHawo8LjBEkxKsg
[0:12:19] <+LOTUSESESESESESESESESESES> I feel bad for Cyberpunk because it's a great game and it's going to be just better and better. Let's be honest, after few months of hard work everyone's going to forget about it and enjoy the game
[0:12:22] <TheSwordFish123> it feels like elements of the ai are disabled or encountering some weird error
[0:12:26] <+Promessa_EX> Even though ai driving was solved many many years ago
[0:12:38] <%r3dray88> @archangel735 like Halo reach Kat or Halo 3 driving?
[0:12:42] <weirdee> the cops can't actually track you, all they can do is teleport towards you
[0:13:05] <+MayorRev> paige in the future gets her skeleton replaced with a metal one just so she can stare at her original bones
[0:13:11] <weirdee> and the way the AI is designed is that when they're in combat mode, they just automatically know where you are no matter what
[0:13:15] <+Dekaku> And now imagine how much it would be falling apart with all the delays.
[0:13:16] <Archangel735> @r3dray88 it totally looks like Halo Reach driving, I just saw DK's driver ram a car with no care
[0:13:18] <fatalrfjl> @lotuseseseseseseseseseses unfortunately a lot of people are very impatient, or the first impression they had with the game will stay
[0:13:21] <+Promessa_EX> Yeah every stream I ever see is dying at least a little
[0:13:23] <weirdee> so once you enter combat mode, you can't escape from it?
[0:13:24] <Dr_Angelic> imho the game is falling apart less but the bugs are masking the absolutely terrible AI design
[0:13:34] <suikudo> My game crashed repeatedly after character creation on pc
[0:13:37] <+Dekaku> *without
[0:13:38] <+Promessa_EX> Like enemies deciding to just take a nap mid fight

[0:13:40] <@Lardcat> quiettArtist Today, Shy is drawing, Paige aka PeachSaliva in the fashion of Cyberpunk! Please enjoy! quiettArtist
[0:13:44] <weirdee> it's like....warframe level AI lol
[0:13:47] <celerkiss> Yo
[0:13:48] <%r3dray88> pfft ok that's bad
[0:13:50] <random_guy_hg> are CDPR usually this broken on launch?
[0:13:52] <NoHoldsBarredProductions> @mayorrev When I saw that you could have a robot skeleton thats legit the first thing I thought of 🤣
[0:14:00] <Archangel735> the game in development during the PS4 runs this bad
[0:14:01] <MoonWatcher21> I don't know if counting Shy's experience is valid as real criticism since well... we all know what satanic hardware Shy has
[0:14:04] <weirdee> and a single player AAA game should not have warframe level AI lol
[0:14:06] <fatalrfjl> Yeah consoles have a extremely had time, it's sooooo bad WutFace
[0:14:07] <Archangel735> thats a real shame
[0:14:09] <BinaryBetrayer> Xbone
[0:14:09] <+LOTUSESESESESESESESESESES> @fatalrfjl that's why the best thing you can do right now is well.. wait half a year and then buy the game
[0:14:24] <Archangel735> it looks like the Xbox 360 era lmao
[0:14:28] <$scootermccummins> Console exclusive bugs!
[0:14:34] <BinaryBetrayer> The game is using the horrible lod models and textures for things straight in your face.
[0:14:46] <snekith> Buying it on last gen is genuinly throwing money to the trash
[0:14:46] <+Promessa_EX> PS4 viewing was just bad. 2008 level textures in that elevator
[0:14:48] <+azeramath> @random_guy_hg no all there witcher games were never broken
[0:14:55] <Cyphereous> I was expecting Peach from Mario, but this is also good.
[0:14:55] <@SarahTsang> I got the game on PS4 coz there's no way i can play it on PC...
[0:15:04] <fatalrfjl> @lotuseseseseseseseseseses that's what I'll do UwU, I really want to enjoy it, but I don't know if I will get it for console or PC ;p
[0:15:08] <@Rozalyndis> rozalySwet
[0:15:10] <recker28122001> ello
[0:15:17] <@Rozalyndis> BULL FUCKING SHIT

[0:15:23] <@SarahTsang> i won't be playing it until next year though so lol
[0:15:24] <weirdee> so, yeah, the way this game plays? it's like an alpha build. and i suspect this is what they were forced to release
[0:15:26] <+UberWolfman> @sarahtsang PridePog PridePog PridePog PridePog
[0:15:28] <Archangel735> @sarahtsang how bad does it run for you on ps4?
[0:15:34] <@Rozalyndis> next gen is supposed to be amazing. because *it's next gen!*
[0:15:47] <eidolonoffire> well, they really messed up the release. they delayed it a lot of times and it was already a sign that there were problems
[0:15:48] <Archangel735> Red Dead Redemption runs on the ps4
[0:15:48] <+MayorRev> So guys what're the chances of a Switch port Kappa
[0:15:50] <+Promessa_EX> That elevator in that first mission was a huge failure point from what I saw. Like what a joke. That had to be tested thousands of times
[0:15:50] <+michingmallecho> If You’re on base ps4/ecks Bawx. Just completely fucked, proper fucked
[0:15:52] <Archangel735> and like ????
[0:15:54] <@SarahTsang> @Archangel735 i haven't opened it coz it's a present. :P
[0:15:56] <Archangel735> theres no excuse
[0:15:58] <+LOTUSESESESESESESESESESES> There's one important thing about Cyberpunk tho. Storyline is great, cyberpunk vibe is strong and it's beautiful. The only problems remaining are bugs (mostly graphic that don't affect gameplay at all).
[0:16:02] <NoHoldsBarredProductions> @weirdee I fully agree. It feels like an alpha build.
[0:16:05] <+michingmallecho> It’s that ray tracing and dlss
[0:16:06] <@SarahTsang> @UberWolfman *waves*
[0:16:07] <TheSwordFish123> witcher 3 also runs 10000x better on litteraly anything
[0:16:09] <%TehMud> I have a low-end PC but it runs fine and still looks better than the console version. Granted I always take FPS over graphics and it took a lot of tweaking settings to get it going.
[0:16:11] <recker28122001> my asus fx505 giving 18 fps at low ........it gave 40 fps for rdr2
[0:16:18] <+NviVoiid> Wait, glyphs are out of stock?
[0:16:21] <%TehMud> I get plenty of car and people blobs
[0:16:25] <weirdee> the reason why it requires such high specs is because nothing was optimized
[0:16:26] <+Mrbaconator> i have been having fun playing it but ye the textures kinda vomit till you get close enough
[0:16:30] <@Rozalyndis> the glyphs restock ever 15 min
[0:16:31] <+azeramath> I won't be playing cyberpunk until this next year cause I need a new gpu
[0:16:35] <+Chettone> Hi Shy, have you lost weight in the past month? your arm looks skinny!
[0:16:37] <Archangel735> @sarahtsang ah ok
[0:16:40] <+Promessa_EX> Rdr2 is a much better looking game
[0:16:45] <@SarahTsang> @TehMud really? What graphics card do you have?
[0:16:48] <BinaryBetrayer> Between Development of Witcher 3 and release of Cyberpunk 2077 CDPR lost LOTS of their original people, though. They were forced to recruit droves of people from USA and Canada.
[0:16:53] <weirdee> you know the funniest shit, the pirated version has optimization fixes that the regular game doesn't have
[0:16:56] <%TehMud> Naw they just all have stealth tech.
[0:16:57] <Billzhuang> Not defending the devs or anything, but optimization has always been pretty crap when it comes to the studio. I had a worst time running Witcher 3 on the same PC rig I currently ahve compared to 2077 tbf. Sure it's personal experience, but it optimization wise it's just the way it is. Remember they ported the PC version of Saints Row 2 and that was absolute shit celrShrug Kappa666

[0:16:59] <Toffol> Teleporting Cops is the best part of the game PogChamp
[0:17:01] <@Rozalyndis> dude that reminds me of the original metal gear solid
[0:17:02] <BinaryBetrayer> That also happens to vehicles when you look away from them.
[0:17:13] <+Dekaku> Remember when Sony accidentally messaged everyone a "Here's how you can refund your preorder" - message, even to those who didnt preorder the game? Sony was on to something.
[0:17:23] <+TheCrispyBoi> ps5 backwards compatible version is fine
[0:17:26] <weirdee> i've had cars instant transmission behind me when i wasn't looking at them
[0:17:28] <%TehMud> @SarahTsang Don't laugh.... a GTX 970.
[0:17:30] <+michingmallecho> Sony knew PogChamp
[0:17:33] <+Promessa_EX> Like that awful Sherlock game
[0:17:34] <+MayorRev> Pat did you see the glitches Vinny encountered
[0:17:35] <Bricky> Oh man we talking 2077 bugs bo8Pog

[0:17:53] <@Lardcat> Hey everyone Shy, DK, and Bricky have created a podcast, Adeptus Rediculous! Where DK knows little about the WH40k universe, and Bricky knows way more, a light-hearted and comedic exposé about different topics is discussed and told. Check it out over at http://adeptusridiculous.com/ . It's available on almost every audio streaming platform there is; it's free; it's hilarious and yet witty. Check it out and enjoy it!
[0:17:54] <Solymr> how many 2077 bugs
[0:17:58] <%LuckiestStorm40> It has 2077 bugs.
[0:18:00] <weirdee> oh, yeah, the minimap doesn't zoom out when you're driving
[0:18:02] <+pectusumbra> It's super good do it!
[0:18:02] <Bricky> Also in the Twitch panels!
[0:18:05] <BinaryBetrayer> That Silent King episode was dope.
[0:18:09] <random_guy_hg> CDPR only made Witcher games before cyberpunk, right?
[0:18:09] <Cyphereous> I'm so angry that my game started melting after the 2 hour point so Steam won't give me a refund.
[0:18:11] <TheSwordFish123> It feels like a game made by a few passionate developers and a ton just kind of there
[0:18:12] <weirdee> which is a basic feature in most open world games with driving
[0:18:12] <%blistexthief> I painted a Necron while listening to the last podcast 10/10
[0:18:14] <@SarahTsang> @TehMud hmm...i have a 1060 ...and i know it would probably ..fuck up my pc
[0:18:14] <+rdark_ksu> seems a shame with all the time it took

[0:18:30] <$Ella_Mental> mizzLurk
[0:18:31] <+Mrbaconator> i had an amazing bug in a cutscene where the barrel of a gun was clipping entirely through someones skull horizontally

[0:18:59] <weirdee> @Cyphereous yeah that's why i bought it from GOG, because they have a 30 day refund period
[0:19:01] <+azeramath> Awesome art as always @quietteshy
[0:19:04] <weirdee> Thanks for the 2020Delivery @rozalyndis
[0:19:05] <+michingmallecho> How did that pass any quality check or just common sense
[0:19:09] <%CruciferousKale> Hi Sarah!
[0:19:20] <weirdee> and at the end of the 30 days i'm just gonna return it lol
[0:19:25] <Solymr> which part of everything
[0:19:30] <Archangel735> "cyberpunk is just about flashy lights right? so therefore there shouldn't be criticism about it" Kappa
[0:19:30] <%norgthefish> Segment that allows you to repeat and repeat the exact moment when girl gets slaped
[0:19:33] <%norgthefish> I regret nothing
[0:19:40] <+michingmallecho> It made me feel weird the first time before it was patched
[0:19:52] <fatalrfjl> Why do you think it took them 7 years of development? :o, it doesn't feel that the time was enough
[0:20:12] <@SarahTsang> Really hate how the "fans" did that to that girl.
[0:20:19] <@Lardcat> quiettAwww Everybody give some love to our wonderful, amazing, super special guest today! Hot take goblin lord and smol but loveable man, PatStaresAt > https://twitter.com/PatStaresAt/ & https://twitch.tv/PatStaresAt/ quiettVaporlove
[0:20:34] <Solymr> even if youre not epileptic you shouldnt watch that
[0:20:36] <Blackbladder> "Emerson"
[0:20:37] <weirdee> yeah there's still youtube vids with that clip
[0:20:39] <Solymr> you might actually be epileptic
[0:20:42] <weirdee> and they're just ticking time bombs
[0:20:42] <Archangel735> ugh that was so disgusting and there are still people saying she's playing the victim @sarahtsang
[0:20:52] <weirdee> and they haven't been edited out
[0:20:54] <Solymr> meanwhile i am gonna watch that
[0:20:59] <Jobi_okino> CyberPunk kinda seems like it'd cause epilepsy without the bugs
[0:21:01] <@SarahTsang> @Archangel735 that's stupid to think that.
[0:21:06] <weirdee> so people streaming, people clipping it
[0:21:10] <BinaryBetrayer> 7 years since announcement, but two years of nothing but sketch and concept work, and after two years of development they had to start scaling back because lots of people left the studio.
[0:21:15] <+LOTUSESESESESESESESESESES> Tbh on the other hand you guys should be glad that CDP made it, not Ubisoft or EA. CDP will fix it instead of abandoning it and announcing Cyerbpunk 2078 like Ubi or EA
[0:21:17] <weirdee> they're all endangering viewers lol
[0:21:22] <snow_found_a_gun> There's a point where the epilepsy warning isn't enough, epileptics are susceptible, but everyone can be harmed by flashing lights
[0:21:24] <MachetePhD> From what I've heard, I THINK they did a hotfix for it yesterday, I dunno how big of an improvement it is, but the way it was worded suggested that it doesn't flash as brightly, and the flashes aren't as rapid
[0:21:25] <Arbutus__unedo> Is knowing your turn bad, though? I think it works in favor of large-ish world maps, making it more memorable. I haven't played Morrowind for some time now, but I still remember a lot of the major roads and even shortcuts
[0:21:26] <+MayorRev> Pat i noticed you had "Seizure warning" when you did your sponsored stream. did your sponsor tell you to add that or did you feel the need to add that yourself?
[0:21:32] <Archangel735> @sarahtsang yea CPDR fans are crazy
[0:21:40] <PrimaryRavioli> have the seizures surpassed Electric Soldier Porygon yet?
[0:21:42] <spongeofmystery> Haven't reached that part, kinda glad it's gone now
[0:21:48] <%PretzelRocks> Now Playing: Monochrome by Scandroid -> https://prtzl.io/gzHZ5ojwyAlBk4TD
[0:21:53] <%norgthefish> The funniest thing about 2077 and Marketing is the fact they drafted Kurtz (The duck man) to make an educational vid about Brain simulation and made it into an AD for the game
[0:21:55] <+michingmallecho> Everyone streaming the game on day one had “seizure warning” in their titles
[0:21:56] <BinaryBetrayer> CDPR are just eastern europe Ubisoft now
[0:21:59] <+toastybites> I hate how discussions about Cyberpunk turned into it either being the worst game in the world or being immune to criticism
[0:22:02] <fatalrfjl> @lotuseseseseseseseseseses that's true, the time will improve the game for sure
[0:22:15] <@SarahTsang> That sucks.
[0:22:18] <weirdee> and i know, i know, "not all gamerz", but jesus christ, why some gamerz
[0:22:19] <$vincam2002> wow
[0:22:27] <PrimedBanshee> I quite enjoy how NPCs rarely seem to be properly synced with none weapon items. Phones just floating around... tarot cards not getting placed on the table.
[0:22:28] <Archangel735> crunch doesnt help
[0:22:29] <wibbwobbler> hopefully there is a lawsuit or 2 coming
[0:22:29] <AnneSQF> may pose risk -> low priority... wut
[0:22:32] <+NviVoiid> Nvoiid - PC <3
[0:22:34] <SpookyBeef7> How is an actual health risk considered low priority??
[0:22:39] <%CruciferousKale> @weirdee that is a perfect summary
[0:22:47] <Them00n> This game needs like 6 more months in oven anyway.
[0:22:53] <+MayorRev> "No time" they say, as they delayed the game multiple times
[0:22:58] <%hotshotfighter> so are we talking about Peach from the Mario Univerise?
[0:23:03] <eidolonoffire> CP77 is at open beta, just like warframe
[0:23:03] <fatalrfjl> in general the game needs time to improve, at least they developers still support the game
[0:23:05] <+MayorRev> the devs, i mean

[0:23:29] <@SarahTsang> @Billzhuang wait holy shit
[0:23:30] <$reedkage> well, I just got a clip of Rebb saying "shit!" my day is complete
[0:23:31] <BinaryBetrayer> Gee, I wonder why so many people left the Studio
[0:23:32] <Bricky> If I'm not wrong, isn't it illegal to work over 48 hours a week by Polish law?
[0:23:38] <eidolonoffire> not yet

[0:24:40] <@SarahTsang> Hi Luetinnnn
[0:24:49] <BinaryBetrayer> Amazing Implementation
[0:24:51] <$vincam2002> my rule with new games is that give it a few months to simmer then sink into it
[0:25:03] <%el_dir> you need to have a 11 hours pause between next work day but this doesn't count additional contracts @Bricky
[0:25:03] <weirdee> i got in a fight in my gf's chat earlier cause one of the users got upset that i was criticizing cp2077 and "those gamerz" so i'm just kinda dissociating rn for a whole week and really i'm gonna just blame cdpr's management for this whole thing lol
[0:25:07] <%hulkmania_jesus> anyone know what song is playing
[0:25:11] <+Cheese_Moon> The guy I was watching had 60fps all around and he was streaming, so I guess its slightly better now

[0:26:47] <%Molhana> Molhana subscribed with Prime. They've subscribed for 5 months! 
[0:27:04] <invalidarg56> Apparently AMD CPU's aren't using all their logical cores while the game is running (I.E. it's not using multi-threading)
[0:27:11] <%el_dir> @Bricky yup, like I worked for year the normal 8 hours and had additional contract that basically meant I was on a call and if it disturbed my sleep it didn't change I had to get to work early in the morning, ye I was a bit tired
[0:27:15] <Meirlerman> looks like shy is too powerful for corona. i guess we need to release something MORE powerful
[0:27:21] <weirdee> yeah the AMD issue is super jank lol
[0:27:30] <weirdee> like i said, it's an alpha build
[0:27:47] <+Mrbaconator> how thematically appropriate

[0:28:11] <@SarahTsang> lol thanks game.
[0:28:23] <weirdee> and these are all the issues that yall care about and not the other issues i can't even mention without flame wars lol

[0:28:39] <fusiondenny> Does this mean we can finally stop acting like CDPR is a saint a treat them like the rest of the AAA studios?
[0:28:45] <@Lardcat> Lardcat subscribed at Tier 3. They've subscribed for 40 months, currently on a 40 month streak! i help shy get better! quiettVaporlove
[0:28:46] <invalidarg56> To be fair tho I am having some fun with it
[0:28:46] <@MGlBlaze> Yeah copyright law is fucking broken
[0:28:46] <+Mrbaconator> man someones gotta get the DMCA looked at by like the supreme court cuz this is some bullshit
[0:28:48] <%Luetin> not to mention the huge amounts of TOS breaking sex stuff lol
[0:28:52] <weirdee> the relic malfunction visual glitch is also probably somewhat dangerous and it happens randomly lol
[0:28:54] <@MGlBlaze> Also hi there
[0:28:57] <+Cheese_Moon> Probably yes
[0:29:02] <weirdee> just saying
[0:29:14] <Archangel735> thank god some more people are realizing that CPDR isnt the best studio ever
[0:29:14] <SpookyBeef7> Twitch is so inconsistent on sexualized content.
[0:29:15] <fatalrfjl> And the amount of people that streamed the game and got hit by copyright
[0:29:16] <Billzhuang> The sex part is 100% TOS btw Kappa666
[0:29:16] <%norgthefish> Twitch has wierd Standards
[0:29:16] <%Luetin> I am sure they just would ignore it
[0:29:18] <Billzhuang> Billzhuang's Cheer shared rewards to 10 others in Chat! 
[0:29:20] <+Cheese_Moon> Hey there, blaze
[0:29:20] <%TWolfJaeger> I thought CDPR went out of their way to hire on a bunch of musicians to write stuff specifically for 2077. Did they not license the music?
[0:29:25] <Archangel735> they're the same as any other companies
[0:29:31] <%Luetin> but its pretty much 100% TOS
[0:29:33] <weirdee> does twitch allow the dildo bat lol
[0:29:40] <@SarahTsang> i always avoid that
[0:29:43] <%Bricky> Yeah, often just playing it normally doesn't cause problems. But If you're doing the "speedrun to 400 fucks" prob not okay lmao
[0:29:46] <+Cheese_Moon> It's not the time to experiement with what's TOS and what's not
[0:29:49] <+Mrbaconator> there do be many titties
[0:29:54] <+pythonxi> pythonxi subscribed with Prime. They've subscribed for 4 months, currently on a 1 month streak!

[0:30:04] <@MGlBlaze> pat lmao
[0:30:11] <Billzhuang> If you really want to see it outside of Twitch just look up a video on YouTube or something HahaShrugLeft HahaShrugMiddle HahaShrugRight
[0:30:15] <%norgthefish> Game awards 2020 are the good example. THEY GAVE PERMISSION EVEN BEGGED TO CO-STREAM. but the moment they play coppyrighted music Twitch goes "HAHA Copystrike go brrr"
[0:30:15] <weirdee> i think you can just skip past story based sex scenes but not sure
[0:30:19] <@Lardcat> If you would like to donate directly to Shy, click the Bit button (looks like a pyramid) on the right side of the chat bar. quiettCashmoney You'll need to purchase the bits, and then cheer# the amount you wish to give. quiettVerycool All donations are helpful and appreciated, no matter how big or small! quiettVaporlove
[0:30:22] <@MGlBlaze> The game was definitely a product of horrible crunch, aye
[0:30:23] <Archangel735> how deep is the game in terms of cyberpunk
[0:30:34] <Archangel735> like are there like commentaries
[0:30:34] <$vincam2002> it was in production for SEVEN FUKIN YEARS
[0:30:37] <%Bricky> YO WE GOT HADES THOUGH
[0:30:43] <HiImTiffers> 2020 aint over yet dont jinx it
[0:30:43] <~QuietteShy> is it gonna be moddable? can public fix their shit like its a bethseda game?
[0:30:44] <+Mrbaconator> i have had tons of fun playing it
[0:30:47] <@SarahTsang> LOU2 winning GOTY @norgthefish LOL
[0:30:48] <%Luetin> DK and people say my Cynicism is not justified lol :D
[0:30:48] <@MGlBlaze> Hopefully it gets patched up over time but right now the actual devs have been run ragged
[0:30:51] <%weissguard> Year's not over yet. NotLikeThis
[0:30:51] <%Firestorm49> 2020, the year of dissapointment
[0:30:54] <Archangel735> HADES IS THE GOAT
[0:30:55] <+Dekaku> tbh, I am looking forward to getting the game, just bdcausd I like character creators.
[0:30:57] <Them00n> Very excited to pick up the Goty edition for $40 in a few years.
[0:31:00] <+MayorRev> There goes your sponsorship pat
[0:31:00] <@MGlBlaze> Also good question, shy
[0:31:01] <%man_of_m00> @Rozalyndis is there a separate channel for when shy streams video games or the flying circus? i always miss them and never get alerts.
[0:31:01] <Billzhuang> Honestly. I went in with 0 expectations and completely blind. Wasn't disappointed celrShrug
[0:31:05] <invalidarg56> The shooting would be fun if the enemies weren't super bullet spongey
[0:31:07] <weirdee> there's moddability being built rn
[0:31:07] <%Luetin> I laugh at all the people who like 1 week ago were like LT YOURE so negative... whose laughing now :D lol
[0:31:09] <%norgthefish> @SarahTsang WHOMST WOULD THINK
[0:31:09] <fatalrfjl> @vincam2002 yeah seven years, maybe they needed more time?
[0:31:11] <+goliath013> I mean i say i have really been enjoying the game and honestly havent encountered too many issues
[0:31:15] <squiddy404> I heard the main story doesn't give you very much choice no matter what you do in the side quests
[0:31:15] <+TWolfJaeger> Well. Project Wingman got released so there's the bright light at the end of my 2020 tunnel.
[0:31:15] <@SarahTsang> @Luetin I have become super cynical over games and game companies over the years
[0:31:18] <weirdee> like i said, even the pirated version comes with fixes lol
[0:31:25] <@Rozalyndis> dude Luetin i'm the same way. i say this every time. hype culture is stupid
[0:31:25] <Arbutus__unedo> TLOU2 winning made 2020 for me. Drinking Gamer™ tears was perfect
[0:31:30] <@MGlBlaze> And people wonder why I'm a cynical bastard that never gets excited
[0:31:32] <+Ghost_MSL> people were cheering CDPR about as much as they were cheering for FO to get back to the studio that made NV - ignoring that NV was buggy AF and Witcher 3 was buggy on launch as well
[0:31:36] <%Luetin> yeah @SarahTsang 100%
[0:31:37] <eidolonoffire> sounds like warframe lol
[0:31:39] <+Cheese_Moon> I'm really happy it got delayed so hard, because if this was released in April, it's just tragic. But now, after the delays, it's a shitshow, and it's funny
[0:31:40] <eydislol> I'm actually wondering if I want to buy Cyberpunk or Crash 4 for XB1. I heard both games are good, but they have some flaws
[0:31:43] <+JBarkey> Deep rock went v1.0 this year.
[0:31:43] <edgemaster69420> It's The new vampire the masquerade bloodlines
[0:31:45] <%norgthefish> I am only salty about it because Hades lost. a campany that forced pepole to go on vacation to not overwork themselfs lost to crunch prime
[0:31:46] <@MGlBlaze> Same here @Rozalyndis
[0:31:49] <%toxic_waltzz> yeah hype definitely screwed them and rushed them over
[0:31:52] <seanbatz> I still can’t get over that 2077 was supposed to come out in APRIL and they attributed that big delay to the start of the pandemic
[0:31:53] <Archangel735> remember when they hyped it up as all choices matter
[0:31:55] <weirdee> NV was buggy for the same reasons lol
[0:31:57] <BettyMwwaahh> @QuietteShy i love your nails! PrideHeartL PrideHeartR
[0:31:58] <@Rozalyndis> @man_of_m00 no we don't have a different channel, this isn't strictly a gaming channel. it's an art show
[0:31:59] <+michingmallecho> Are there choices Jebaited
[0:32:00] <%Luetin> It is @Rozalyndis and yet always ppl come at being like - dont be sooo negative... if you dont like it, dont playyyyyy etc etc
[0:32:04] <+michingmallecho> Nothing matters
[0:32:05] <~QuietteShy> there are SOME choices, from time to time, but its very railroaded, especially during main quests
[0:32:09] <Archangel735> DK crucified a guy lmfao
[0:32:12] <Billzhuang> There are dialogues choices though. I got 2 or 3 yellow options for some of the main and "good" sidquests.
[0:32:14] <weirdee> people just need to stop flogging their devs while at the same time pretending to stan for them lol
[0:32:16] <%jimthebingle> jimthebingle subscribed with Prime. They've subscribed for 30 months! What makes you a criminal in 2077?
[0:32:21] <squiddy404> nah bc warframe never promises the updates are going to be the greatest game ever
[0:32:23] <@SarahTsang> @Arbutus__unedo I wish i wasn't cynical, i wish i was an optimist...but i knew LOU2 would win eugh.
[0:32:33] <Solymr> putting pineapple in pizza
[0:32:33] <%Bricky> oh hell yeah repenting
[0:32:33] <+michingmallecho> The illusion of choice...thanks a lot David Cagė, BioWare, and the rest
[0:32:34] <@SarahTsang> @jimthebingle <3
[0:32:36] <%Bricky> oh nevermind
[0:32:40] <@SarahTsang> That quest was disgusting
[0:32:42] <+TheCrispyBoi> ....
[0:32:42] <fruit_pie_the_magician> Yeah because serial killer NEVER find god
[0:32:43] <+Dekaku> arbutus, did you play the game? I did, and didnt like it, so of course it got goty.
[0:32:44] <MoonWatcher21> It's weird because the witcher 3 is arguably one of the best games ever made and suddenly Cyberpunk is horrible
[0:32:47] <@SarahTsang> i'm glad it was optional quest.
[0:32:47] <%norgthefish> OH NO
[0:32:48] <%PretzelRocks> Now Playing: Claret by Occams Laser -> https://prtzl.io/9GHWG6DD3Qayy7U9
[0:32:49] <weirdee> yeah the way the game is made looks like you have choices, but if you watch other people's playthrus you find out that it's fake
[0:32:54] <+Ghost_MSL> ...
[0:32:54] <%man_of_m00> @Rozalyndis alright thanks, so you all just stream games whenever then?
[0:32:54] <+LiquidDinosaur> is Braindance like a simstim?
[0:32:55] <BinaryBetrayer> Ow, the edge
[0:32:56] <+Cheese_Moon> What the hell
[0:32:56] <Archangel735> that was some quest
[0:32:58] <spongeofmystery> Fucking WHAT
[0:32:58] <%toxic_waltzz> very family friendly huh
[0:32:58] <%green_daemon> that's what I am most disappointed about. The bugs are whatever, I expected a lot more choices and different paths to go down
[0:33:00] <%TehMud> Oh THAT'S the mission I've been hearing about.
[0:33:01] <bomi1995> oh
[0:33:01] <khyldr> wtf
[0:33:01] <SpookyBeef7> I... don't know how to feel about that.
[0:33:02] <@MGlBlaze> Holy shit the edge
[0:33:02] <%norgthefish> Thats a big nono
[0:33:04] <+Cheese_Moon> Yeah I share your opinions, DK
[0:33:07] <Them00n> Sounds cool honestly.
[0:33:07] <weirdee> that quest was uh
[0:33:07] <@SarahTsang> that was a fucking terrible quest.
[0:33:09] <weirdee> something
[0:33:11] <%Luetin> Also can I say - they have ripped a LOT of stuff from Remember Me. Which is a very good Cyberpunk game. 2013.
[0:33:11] <+LastHazzerd> aight, i don't want to buy the game anymore
[0:33:12] <@Rozalyndis> once in a galactic equinox @man_of_m00
[0:33:15] <%Bricky> Man I just finished DMC5 and that game wasn't that edgy lmao
[0:33:18] <%el_dir> why not
[0:33:23] <Archangel735> yea dude cyberpunk was totally about crucifying a guy
[0:33:23] <Cyphereous> @LiquidDinosaur Sensory enabled recorded. Watch and feel sex simultaneously and such
[0:33:26] <+LiquidDinosaur> BIG THE CAT CROSSIFIED JESUS
[0:33:35] <+Mrbaconator> i like V, he's got fun dialogue
[0:33:39] <+FennecZephyr> I've been really happy with Fem V's voice acting so far
[0:33:41] <+michingmallecho> Female V is better
[0:33:41] <+JBarkey> @liquiddinosaur full immersion ‘real vr’ including emotion is what brain dance is.
[0:33:41] <SaxStreaming> imagine spending hours customizing your character just to see it on mirrors or your inventory screen
[0:33:42] <@Rozalyndis> right @Bricky ? it felt just... kinda underwhelming
[0:33:44] <Archangel735> the whole game just oozes with LOOK HOW EDGY AND CYVERPUNKY WE ARE
[0:33:44] <+Nandedame> Tbh you can't just tell them them you don't want to help them.
[0:33:48] <Cyphereous> Fake customizable character
[0:33:49] <+Nandedame> can*
[0:33:49] <weirdee> i bet people will complain more about that cross bit than the other bits tho
[0:33:51] <squiddy404> its also another game you play as a mercenary with no personalityTM
[0:33:55] <wibbwobbler> yea actually
[0:33:59] <+LiquidDinosaur> @JBarkey @Cyphereous are there BTLs? like, illegal ones that are realer tan real?
[0:34:06] <@SarahTsang> if you make a big dick, it will glitch lmao
[0:34:08] <%toxic_waltzz> I heard it was very limited, but penis 2 man
[0:34:08] <%norgthefish> peepee bug LUL
[0:34:08] <suikudo> Every V will be different!
[0:34:11] <%TehMud> @Bricky Well that's because DMC is about silly pizza man and so over the top ya can't take it seriously most of the time.
[0:34:12] <@MGlBlaze> Marketing people talking shit, big surprise there
[0:34:12] <Cyphereous> There are literally only 6 penis options. I cannot believe this.
[0:34:13] <weirdee> the character creation is also in alpha
[0:34:13] <+Mrbaconator> i wanted a pringles can for a dick! 😠
[0:34:16] <%Bricky> woah
[0:34:16] <snow_found_a_gun> I remember that quest was like a topic of some kind of praise when people who played Cyberpunk early found it, like "ooo so metal, so scandalous"
[0:34:17] <@Rozalyndis> DARK SOULS had better creator
[0:34:18] <weirdee> like there's no proper sliders
[0:34:18] <Archangel735> cant even customize midgame lmfao
[0:34:19] <%Bricky> that's sacrilage
[0:34:21] <+michingmallecho> I wish there were more penis options NotLikeThis
[0:34:23] <+logoth_> Penis 1 Penis 2
[0:34:28] <Dilettante> It's like how Sims 4 only has like 3 options for human-height fences but 3 dozen choices for toilets
[0:34:30] <Cyphereous> @LiquidDinosaur Yes, that's people getting murdered and such.
[0:34:32] <weirdee> it's like a preview of what the character creator could be
[0:34:35] <+RNGbob> Larian looks more like the RPG promised ones than CDPR
[0:34:36] <weirdee> an alpha build
[0:34:36] <+toastybites> It honestly should have been un-voiced like Fallout 3/NV
[0:34:37] <Archangel735> @rozalyndis TRUEEE
[0:34:43] <%Firestorm49> So Saints Row had better character customization?
[0:34:45] <+Mrbaconator> penis and the block buster sequel penis 2
[0:34:50] <%Luetin> I am just hopeful that people will finally learn from this - that bullshit hype - is a huge HUGE RED FLAG...
[0:34:52] <%TehMud> The character creator was pretty disappointing.
[0:34:56] <fruit_pie_the_magician> If i'm honest the character creator reminded me of Ark except less extensive
[0:34:58] <%Bricky> I started up an Outer Worlds playthrough yesterday and the character customization is absolutely top tier compared to 2077
[0:34:59] <+Explain_Edd> Demon Souls low-key had better customization too
[0:35:08] <@SarahTsang> Loads of people asked for a Barber shop in their tweet earlier asking waht they want in the game.
[0:35:08] <@MGlBlaze> @Luetin They never will.
[0:35:12] <%darklord_kris> Hairstyle is also linke to some headwear
[0:35:14] <+Mrbaconator> i ran into people who thought the char creator was good it was baffling
[0:35:16] <squiddy404> is the combat any good
[0:35:18] <weirdee> no, they just wanna make fun of girldick, that's what gamerz want
[0:35:19] <@Lardcat> quiettArtist Today, Shy is drawing, Paige aka PeachSaliva in the fashion of Cyberpunk! Please enjoy! quiettArtist
[0:35:25] <Cyphereous> I'd rather just go through Deus Ex than Cyberpunk honestly.
[0:35:28] <fusiondenny> People did not learn from No Man's Sky and they will not learn from 2077
[0:35:28] <Archangel735> just goes to show that if you jerk off the gamer community they'll do the advertising for you too
[0:35:31] <weirdee> gunplay is a bit sloppy
[0:35:34] <SaxStreaming> cyberpunk hype was so loud for what it ended up being
[0:35:34] <@Rozalyndis> on a related note let's talk about amazon prime
[0:35:35] <weirdee> melee is a bit sloppy
[0:35:39] <@Rozalyndis> rozalyLel
[0:35:42] <weirdee> it's all just pretty sloppy
[0:35:45] <+patel347> <3
[0:35:47] <%hotshotfighter> wait we are done already?
[0:35:51] <weirdee> it's more fun to be the hackerman god most of the time
[0:35:53] <fruit_pie_the_magician> To be fair there was only hype because Witcher 3 was way better than everything else they ever made, so everyone thought this would be better than Witcher 3
[0:35:55] <Cyphereous> What about it?
[0:35:55] <+Ghost_MSL> i saw a vid of SpiffingBrit - breaking the crafting system
[0:36:01] <Archangel735> we're done FeelsBadMan
[0:36:03] <Solymr> wew thats short
[0:36:06] <weirdee> the only fun part of the combat is hackerman
[0:36:08] <+Ghost_MSL> but they patched that
[0:36:11] <Solymr> feeling alright about that covid?
[0:36:14] <%norgthefish> That We're done. I though shy in spirit of 2077 would leave her art unfinished
[0:36:18] <+LiquidDinosaur> is Witcher canon
[0:36:18] <%GreatDane01> Cyberpunk 2077 at its current state should prove to everyone how bad crunch is
[0:36:19] <+Mrbaconator> it very much seems to me like crafted weapons have way better stats
[0:36:23] <+MayorRev> we all done?
[0:36:27] <%TehMud> Lord I'm still terrible at writing in cursive
[0:36:30] <@Rozalyndis> no not at all
[0:36:33] <logan_ow0> So Johnny Silverhand (AkA Keanu Reeves) was made to be a big deal. How was his character?
[0:36:33] <@Rozalyndis> !names
[0:36:34] <@Lardcat> "What are the names Shy's writing??" "Why does she write names?" quiettSellout Those are the names of all of today's subscribers and donors! quiettCashmoney Everyone who's subbed or given bits, this is how Shy thanks them--since she can't audibly thank them. quiettThinkin
[0:36:36] <@MGlBlaze> Spore, No Man's Sky (though that's actually good now), EA's Battlefronts, Mass Effect: Andromeda, Anthem, so many others I can't remember. People as a whole never learn to stop buying in to marketing hype, ever.
[0:36:38] <+Ghost_MSL> @QuietteShy hope you're doing well - heard you got sick
[0:36:39] <@SarahTsang> @MayorRev a while to go
[0:36:42] <weirdee> like the hackerman feature of the game is just incredible (even if the hackerman puzzle is kinda eh)
[0:36:48] <Toffol> You can farm infinite exp with the crafting tree, but it's pointless because you can just find better stuff
[0:36:49] <%PretzelRocks> Now Playing: Craft of the Untamed by Occams Laser -> https://prtzl.io/2AHMVLZ6engG2Ohk
[0:36:50] <darklord_kris> To be fair, right now CyberPunk 2077 feels like 60% of a game
[0:36:50] <weirdee> yeah the borderlands looting system
[0:36:54] <Cyphereous> Well I will say being able to craft the equivalent of Legendaries can work.
[0:36:54] <weirdee> it's funny as hell
[0:37:01] <+MayorRev> oh i saw the "we're done" and thought we were just doing a sketch
[0:37:02] <%Firestorm49> @LiquidDinosaur I think the first game is, 2 and 3rd aren't
[0:37:11] <weirdee> the crafting costs a lot of perk points tho
[0:37:13] <@Rozalyndis> oh haha that was last stream's
[0:37:17] <+Mrbaconator> the numbers on crafted DPS seems WAY higher than stuff i could fine i just can't craft those tiers yet
[0:37:18] <%norgthefish> Good experience and player experience would be better Marketing than any 1MIL ad can create
[0:37:24] <Cyphereous> The legendaries would need to work like Path of Exile though, where they can be super good but are not necessarily the best.
[0:37:27] <fruit_pie_the_magician> I feel like the is where Prey 2 was when they canceled it
[0:37:35] <%norgthefish> like you are more willing to check out the game if you watch it and see that someone has fun with it
[0:37:38] <+toastybites> It's a bit too meta
[0:37:39] <Billzhuang> There's photo mode for free cam btw... Kappa666
[0:37:41] <+Mrbaconator> like this legendary baseball bat i bought did 250 DPS but if i could craft it it does like 600
[0:37:41] <Billzhuang> Billzhuang's Cheer shared rewards to 10 others in Chat! 
[0:37:43] <%Bricky> Wait, does the game not have any non 1st person stuff? Like Destiny or something during gamepaly?
[0:37:46] <Solymr> Thanks for the 2020Rivalry @billzhuang
[0:37:46] <%TehMud> I also wish Cyberpunk had transmog
[0:37:48] <weirdee> you can use photo mode to see yourself
[0:37:53] <%Luetin> I will say - its a game thats very easy to be negative on - I have found that if I try to let myself be immersed in it, it has been more enjoyable.
[0:37:54] <@MGlBlaze> Thanks @Billzhuang !
[0:37:58] <%GreatDane01> At first I was thinking about buying Cyberpunk after finals, but now I might wait until iether the first big round of bug fixes/updates or whenever theres a sale on steam
[0:38:00] <%TWolfJaeger> Rest assured, the T-pose bug exists on bikes as well.
[0:38:01] <+michingmallecho> driving is completely fucked
[0:38:08] <%Luetin> Oh the driving. The driving is insane in first person
[0:38:09] <%norgthefish> jamesPENG huang plz
[0:38:10] <@SarahTsang> @Billzhuang the only reason why i wanna play Cyberpunk is for photo mode LOL
[0:38:12] <+michingmallecho> It’s floaty
[0:38:14] <Archangel735> when they took out wall running and customizable cars I knew it was gonna have a scuffed launch
[0:38:15] <+Ghost_MSL> driving has been described like driving a bar of soap
[0:38:17] <%TehMud> I basically ping pong from objects when I drive in the game. There may or may not be a trail of bodies in my wake.
[0:38:17] <%norgthefish> save some munne
[0:38:23] <fullyloaded47> Once you get mantis blades the game gets 10x easer
[0:38:24] <~QuietteShy> THERE ARE LIKE 200 CARS FOR SALE IN THIS GAME AND THEY ALL HANDLE THE SAME : LIKE A CLOCKWORK TURD ROLLING OFF A HILL INTO A WOODCHIPPER
[0:38:24] <Jobi_okino> First person driving being bad in any game indicates that the driving quality is bad, just look at payday2
[0:38:27] <+michingmallecho> I feel like I’m sliding across the roads
[0:38:29] <weirdee> first person driving sucks because the viewing angles of the car windows are too shallow
[0:38:30] <+MayorRev> i hope CDPR can pull a sean murray and turn this game around over time
[0:38:39] <+ArmoredDeath> the first time I drove and spuj the camera too fast so my character and Jackie t posed out of the car
[0:38:40] <weirdee> also the car doesn't have a rear view mirror
[0:38:43] <Toffol> I hate how car chasing sequences it doesn't really matter what you do, the game just completes it for you after a while
[0:38:43] <Jobi_okino> Like if the driving in first person sucks then the driving isn
[0:38:44] <+Mrbaconator> @Luetin im having fun running around frantically bonking people and sending them to horny jail
[0:38:44] <%green_daemon> lmao, true
[0:38:46] <Jobi_okino> well thought out
[0:38:49] <Solymr> "clockwork turd"
[0:38:49] <Billzhuang> @SarahTsang Photo Mode is the same as Shadow of Mordors. Funny as hell when timed just right LUL
[0:38:55] <BinaryBetrayer> They will crush their studio under their heel in order to pull a Sean Murray
[0:38:57] <Archangel735> CPDR never learned from horse gameplay
[0:38:58] <weirdee> yeah let's talk about
[0:39:02] <weirdee> there's no flashlight
[0:39:06] <@MGlBlaze> So basically, Cyberpunk 2077: Directed by J. J. Abrams
[0:39:07] <+toastybites> tbh I think Rockstar would have done a better job because they have the world AI down pretty well
[0:39:11] <%norgthefish> @QuietteShy that also means you can chose whatever you want instead of "this looks nice but stats are shit. time to buy Generic sport car"
[0:39:15] <weirdee> there's no nightvision eye mod????????????????????????????
[0:39:16] <%ragedbridge> ragedbridge subscribed with Prime. They've subscribed for 6 months! 
[0:39:16] <@Rozalyndis> before
[0:39:20] <@SarahTsang> @ragedbridge <3
[0:39:27] <%pythonxi> <3 <3 <3 <3
[0:39:28] <weirdee> my eyes can't be augmented to wear sunglasses at night!
[0:39:29] <%green_daemon> why does a motorcycle handle the same as a fucking sprinter van quiettRee
[0:39:33] <Billzhuang> Delamain's quests aren't as intrusive as Fixers constantly bugging you about a new gig/side mission available celrShrug
[0:39:34] <weirdee> like why?
[0:39:34] <Archangel735> nope no nightvision
[0:39:38] <@SarahTsang> Imagine a Cyberpunk online ...like GTA online
[0:39:48] <+LastHazzerd> limesAw
[0:39:50] <@MGlBlaze> wat
[0:39:51] <%TehMud> The pings can also be so confusing. "Go this way" "Game this is a wall"
[0:39:52] <+Ghost_MSL> the enemy AI is ... questionable
[0:39:54] <Solymr> NotLikeThis
[0:39:57] <@Rozalyndis> quiettWat

[0:40:06] <%toxic_waltzz> Wonderful
[0:40:09] <+MayorRev> CRIME TIME
[0:40:11] <Solymr> i already saw the tweet of cdpr forgetting about singleplayer
[0:40:12] <@MGlBlaze> Wow, that's super dumb
[0:40:14] <Solymr> forever
[0:40:15] <%Bricky> God bless the USA
[0:40:15] <+michingmallecho> LUL LUL LUL LUL
[0:40:17] <Cyphereous> @SarahTsang Aren't they supposed to be making a multiplayer mode?
[0:40:18] <Archangel735> that is some early 2000s AI

[0:40:22] <fruit_pie_the_magician> Okay actually i need to play this now
[0:40:22] <%toxic_waltzz> No wonder the trailer said the crime rates were high
[0:40:23] <+MayorRev> ahahahaha
[0:40:23] <weirdee> my bike sometimes spawns halfway into the ground
[0:40:25] <squiddy404> that's horrifying
[0:40:26] <@Rozalyndis> that's a Mythic Proportions there
[0:40:32] <%Firestorm49> That's even worse than GTA cops
[0:40:40] <fruit_pie_the_magician> Dystopia is fucking right
[0:40:40] <@SarahTsang> @Cyphereous haven't heard about that ;o
[0:40:41] <weirdee> btw, there's this weird bug i found
[0:40:42] <Solymr> multiplayer gonna be cyberpunk 76
[0:40:48] <squiddy404> i'm so glad i didnt buy it
[0:40:51] <SaxStreaming> Remember guys, Cyberpunk was delayed many times so it released with not many bugs
[0:40:56] <weirdee> if i flip my bike upside down i can use it to access my stash
[0:41:00] <Cyphereous> I could've sworn they talked about it.
[0:41:03] <weirdee> i don't know why that happens???
[0:41:15] <%CruciferousKale> So when are we getting our Johnny Mnemonic watch party?
[0:41:22] <%TehMud> Sounds like Metal Gear AI
[0:41:24] <+Grayhammatter> oh god
[0:41:29] <@MGlBlaze> LUL
[0:41:39] <+Grayhammatter> LUL
[0:41:51] <+MayorRev> sickkkkk

[0:42:12] <+Goteafish> geeez......
[0:42:15] <Toffol> Just waiting for Shy's eventual Cyberpunk is a bug-free game
[0:42:19] <%toxic_waltzz> oh man now that sounds horrible
[0:42:36] <weirdee> @SaxStreaming the truth was that a year ago cdpr execs knew that there wasn't enough time so they crunched them in the hopes of making up for it earlier but it didn't work
[0:42:38] <%PretzelRocks> Now Playing: Neon Towers by Cassetter -> https://prtzl.io/6DHJW2AK8bD3EoC9
[0:42:44] <Solymr> its gonna be a movie
[0:42:52] <Archangel735> lol
[0:42:55] <+Grayhammatter> jesus LUL
[0:42:59] <%TehMud> I've been playing as Goro Majima. Just running around like a lunatic and knifing everyone. Still need an eyepatch though.
[0:43:03] <Cyphereous> So you can kill all of Night City
[0:43:03] <%man_of_m00> The monowire can hit through walls
[0:43:10] <@SarahTsang> Nice
[0:43:14] <Jobi_okino> Okay but would you be more confused if you had a quest to go back and kill someone you already did
[0:43:17] <+Mrbaconator> i kind of prefer it that way personally
[0:43:18] <Solymr> that sounds like a challenge
[0:43:20] <fullyloaded47> I called someone then they spawned next to me
[0:43:30] <weirdee> yeah i've noticed that the game lets me enter quest areas early
[0:43:34] <+Ghost_MSL> @man_of_m00 like the old Atterax in WF?
[0:43:34] <weirdee> i don't get why
[0:43:37] <Billzhuang> The Kusanagi is a great bike, but Jackie's is still the best overall
[0:43:51] <Makiiras> IGN: Makiiras Platform: PC
[0:43:56] <+michingmallecho> Tetsuooooooo
[0:43:59] <%man_of_m00> @Ghost_MSL exactly like the atterax
[0:43:59] <wibbwobbler> hard 2 rp 4 me
[0:44:03] <Archangel735> how deep is the story since its a Cyberpunk game
[0:44:23] <%Luetin> Ive never used fast travel
[0:44:27] <%Luetin> This game is all about immersion
[0:44:35] <weirdee> the story is actually deep at times, but people might not jive with it long enough to enjoy it
[0:44:36] <+commanderclaw> I feel like every gameplay avenue is second best compared to other games. It's like someone took other games and put them in a blender
[0:44:36] <%TWolfJaeger> I'm disappointed that car stats don't exist.
[0:44:37] <+boxofmango> we talkin bout 2077
[0:44:39] <+boxofmango> ??
[0:44:47] <weirdee> and V's characterization can be a turnoff
[0:44:49] <%Luetin> If you really try hard to put yourself into the game and the dialogue, it helps to put some of the bad stuff to one side
[0:44:52] <+Mrbaconator> i mostly run around doing sidequests the fast travel is super useful for it @Luetin
[0:45:02] <@MGlBlaze> I need to go for a bit; have fun, all. And your work is amazing as always, Shy! quiettVaporlove
[0:45:06] <+Ghost_MSL> @man_of_m00 ... but a mono whip would have pretty much minimal wall pen... it have almost no mass
[0:45:08] <%norgthefish> PS4 Ver of Cyberpunk is the ART
[0:45:19] <Dilettante> Kirito level?

[0:45:21] <%Luetin> yup street
[0:45:25] <+Cheese_Moon> Oh nice, one of each
[0:45:31] <weirdee> street here
[0:45:39] <%commanderclaw> commanderclaw subscribed with Prime. 
[0:45:42] <+Mrbaconator> something ill say is fuck the corpo start. it's not all in on being a corporate sleeze bag enough
[0:45:52] <+Mrbaconator> "go do this horrific atrocity" and there is no YOU GOT IT BOSS option
[0:45:53] <@SarahTsang> @commanderclaw <3
[0:46:07] <+Grayhammatter> oh wow LUL
[0:46:07] <Archangel735> LUL just teleported
[0:46:11] <+goliath013> Have you guys ever crashed in a motorcycle at 180mph? Im surprised i didnt take any damage upon landing from being launched lol
[0:46:16] <~QuietteShy> i went with nomad, coz the only thing u can create in this character creator is weird ass floridian trailer dweller
[0:46:20] <%PretzelRocks> Now Playing: New York City Nights - Instrumental by Scandroid -> https://prtzl.io/4JHK7Zp5jXMx3PIO
[0:46:21] <+toastybites> I hate how they put you through a montage of you building your reputation in the beginning. It should have been playable
[0:46:22] <weirdee> cop car teleport
[0:46:22] <fatalrfjl> LUL LUL LUL
[0:46:23] <fluxaga> LUL LUL LUL
[0:46:36] <%hotshotfighter> so do you guys thing people should play Cyberpunk 2077?
[0:46:39] <+MayorRev> Vinny found it too
[0:46:58] <weirdee> yeah that montage, i bet they did it because they didn't have enough time to make *that part* the tutorial
[0:47:06] <weirdee> they were probably planning to
[0:47:07] <Archangel735> it got so overhyped
[0:47:11] <BettyMwwaahh> ive seen npcs T-Pose through the roof of the cars as their driving down roads
[0:47:13] <%man_of_m00> @Ghost_MSL if its what i think it is like a graphene knife then it makes sense, its one micron thick so it just cuts through things easily
[0:47:15] <+Cheese_Moon> Don't buy it yet
[0:47:23] <fluxaga> so after mods it'll be a decent game
[0:47:23] <+Cheese_Moon> wait for it to get fixed
[0:47:23] <weirdee> so they instead made the combat tutorial in a chip with no feature objects
[0:47:26] <@SarahTsang> Imagine if Cyberpunk had good character customisation like Black Desert Online
[0:47:28] <+Cheese_Moon> and then wait for a discount
[0:47:29] <condimellitus> Hi Shy, whatcha drawing?
[0:47:34] <@SarahTsang> !drawing
[0:47:34] <@Lardcat> quiettArtist Today, Shy is drawing, Paige aka PeachSaliva in the fashion of Cyberpunk! Please enjoy! quiettArtist
[0:47:38] <Arbutus__unedo> And I thought Skyrim's vanilla CC was underwhelming, in 2011
[0:47:38] <%TWolfJaeger> I do like that Johnny is basically what DE could do if the man in the wall actually had a purpose.
[0:47:48] <weirdee> like that whole mission to get revenge on the fixer sounded like it was fun but they don't let you play it lol
[0:47:50] <$vincam2002> @DK Dc universe only has more character creation options
[0:47:56] <%TehMud> I think my favorite character creator in recent memory was Nioh 2.
[0:48:00] <squiddy404> apparently people can fall from the sky and die but i don't know if that's a bug or CDPR being edgy
[0:48:00] <weirdee> so if you don't pay attention you don't understand what it was showing
[0:48:01] <+LiquidDinosaur> if that's Cyberpunk how come her boobs arent sticking out of her clothes
[0:48:01] <+storebrandcandy> I like the big hair
[0:48:02] <blindbean4> Ya know, you should be used to that considering you play warframe
[0:48:04] <%Luetin> I think the biggest problem with Cyberpunk though is not all of its problems - its the fact that all the stuff within it is not original at all - Its borrowed so much from other titles - Farcry, Remember Me etc.
[0:48:09] <aeravon> Where is the cyber-mustard bottle on a chain from her belt?
[0:48:13] <condimellitus> i thought for a sec it looked like a Operator lol
[0:48:14] <arvidonfire> spin the spinners?
[0:48:27] <+LiquidDinosaur> Does what happen? the boob thing?
[0:48:33] <%commanderclaw> I agree Luetin, everything is just like a second best version of another game
[0:48:37] <AnneSQF> link?
[0:48:43] <+Ghost_MSL> i saw AnneMunition play through that quest with the car theft - and the cops DIDN'T come screeching in... they fucking teleported in, cars and all
[0:48:45] <+Promessa_EX> They could have taken a peak at character creator mods in every game ever
[0:48:47] <blindbean4> oh god it's Anthem again isn't it
[0:49:03] <JaceSaurrows> shadowrun!
[0:49:06] <%Luetin> yup I really do think so @commanderclaw
[0:49:10] <Solymr> no need to be insulting
[0:49:10] <SaxStreaming> Anthem existed, right
[0:49:17] <weirdee> yeah cyberpunk 2077 kinda apes other games poorly lol
[0:49:18] <$R3Roundabout> 2077 is just Watchdogs 2 but broken
[0:49:22] <+Mrbaconator> gorilla arms are great
[0:49:22] <squiddy404> return to monke
[0:49:24] <Rygadune> Most "gameplay" trailers are built and coded separately by other teams
[0:49:30] <weirdee> yeah what stands out as weird and misplaced is the knives upgrades
[0:49:32] <JaceSaurrows> they "borrowed" a lot from shadowrun
[0:49:35] <+LiquidDinosaur> JUMP GOOD
[0:49:37] <weirdee> they're completely worthless
[0:49:37] <%TehMud> Yeah they're kinda meh. Deus Ex had such good upgrades
[0:49:38] <Archangel735> if you want a cyberpunk game just play Deus Ex chat
[0:49:43] <~QuietteShy> WHERES THE FUCKING CHAINSAW ARM PROJECTRED? IT WAS IN THE ORIGINAL TABLETOP YOU FUCKERS
[0:49:46] <wibbwobbler> no more rpgs i guess man
[0:49:50] <+Mrbaconator> or shadow run
[0:49:51] <%TehMud> I never asked for this.
[0:49:51] <Archangel735> also play RUINER
[0:49:52] <+Mr_Pylon> Shadowrun Dragonfall is great too
[0:49:53] <BettyMwwaahh> lame ass Cyberpunk enhancements
[0:49:54] <%norgthefish> "What a shame"
[0:49:55] <%Luetin> I was most disappointed with the lack of cyber upgrades - I also was disappointed that when you do upgrade, you dont actually have to go through the operation procedures.
[0:49:56] <arvidonfire> I never ended up playing Mankind Divided. Was it good?
[0:50:05] <Saltmeisterr> shadowrun i hear is pretty good
[0:50:13] <Archangel735> I cant be a fucking cat girl in cyberpunk 0/10
[0:50:19] <@Lardcat> Hey everyone Shy, DK, and Bricky have created a podcast, Adeptus Rediculous! Where DK knows little about the WH40k universe, and Bricky knows way more, a light-hearted and comedic exposé about different topics is discussed and told. Check it out over at http://adeptusridiculous.com/ . It's available on almost every audio streaming platform there is; it's free; it's hilarious and yet witty. Check it out and enjoy it!
[0:50:19] <+MayorRev> you wanna play an action packed cyberpunk game, play RUINER
[0:50:19] <fullyloaded47> Both the arm upgrades can just one shot almost if not all things
[0:50:20] <%hotshotfighter> who is Peach Saliva?
[0:50:21] <weirdee> yeah i think the implants were originally gonna have more features
[0:50:22] <squiddy404> no dick lasers :(
[0:50:23] <aljegu> Even Prey's upgrades felt better
[0:50:28] <weirdee> but they didn't have enough time for it
[0:50:30] <%norgthefish> I need to worry why most of Futuristic polish games are set in Cyber distopia hellhole
[0:50:39] <weirdee> like two thirds of the implants are missing
[0:50:39] <+toastybites> @arvidonfire it was good but it was too short
[0:50:40] <+Promessa_EX> Yeah customization should be the biggest thing
[0:50:41] <+Mrbaconator> i got one that just gave me 90 armor and that was pretty good
[0:50:43] <weirdee> that's what it feels like
[0:50:49] <+Mrbaconator> tho that dropped off someone
[0:50:50] <%norgthefish> also fuck you too Ruiner devs
[0:50:53] <bomi1995> peach is a twitch streamer and pat’s gf
[0:50:57] <%TehMud> @arvidonfire It's still good. Not as good as HR but still good.
[0:50:59] <@SarahTsang> Added Deus Ex Human Revolution to my steam wishlist
[0:51:00] <%commanderclaw> Yeah, the combat is super Rocket Tag
[0:51:03] <weirdee> you can't even get hair styling or tattoos????
[0:51:20] <weirdee> like you can get tats in the creator
[0:51:22] <weirdee> but only a few
[0:51:25] <%PretzelRocks> Now Playing: Mixer Effect by Harris Heller -> https://prtzl.io/jDH8M7lGaBkxjZs1
[0:51:33] <+Ghost_MSL> did anyone see SpiffingBrit break the damage system in CP2077?
[0:51:33] <Archangel735> feels so good to criticize this game without a CPDR fan shitting on this discussion
[0:51:35] <~QuietteShy> They aint had time to fix this game coz they been too busy adding fucking youtubers into this game like its motherfucking hunt down the freeman
[0:51:37] <weirdee> but you can't go to like, a mod shop and get other tattoos
[0:51:58] <weirdee> lol the youtubers
[0:52:00] <weirdee> god
[0:52:01] <Archangel735> so many fucking celebs
[0:52:04] <Solymr> theres youtubers in the game?
[0:52:06] <+Grayhammatter> how ya feeling shy?
[0:52:07] <Cyphereous> Fallout has some percentage increases but those are pretty early minor things.
[0:52:07] <squiddy404> cyberpunk without the punk
[0:52:07] <%StillStuff> It's an amazing game. But it is very much not what people expected.
[0:52:13] <%norgthefish> oh cox
[0:52:14] <+Mrbaconator> i loved jesses quest it was funny
[0:52:17] <+Promessa_EX> Oh man
[0:52:19] <weirdee> yeah the ones in the gigs
[0:52:21] <+MayorRev> wait what youtubers
[0:52:22] <+toastybites> they could have used that genital customization time to fix more bugs
[0:52:23] <Jobi_okino> GTA 5 had better character customization Kappa
[0:52:26] <arvidonfire> Jesse Cox is in??????
[0:52:31] <wibbwobbler> thnx 4 kojima
[0:52:31] <weirdee> they also put kojima in the main story as a cameo
[0:52:40] <%commanderclaw> It's kind of amazing to me that the Hacking I spec'd into is worse than Watch Dog's version of the same thing
[0:52:40] <$vincam2002> i was hoping for a ciri easter egg
[0:52:40] <weirdee> yeah that was jesse cox lol
[0:52:41] <+Mrbaconator> i didn't know he was in the game and recognized him by the voice
[0:52:41] <%Dmrfc> Dmrfc subscribed at Tier 1. 
[0:52:45] <@SarahTsang> @Dmrfc <3
[0:52:51] <Garthunox> where's pat in the game?
[0:52:56] <+MayorRev> who else is in this?
[0:53:05] <weirdee> the quest is kinda funny cause of the roadblocks
[0:53:06] <+LastHazzerd> brownie points
[0:53:07] <yesyesyes1232> is shy also in there?
[0:53:10] <BettyMwwaahh> Marketing
[0:53:11] <%flumblum23> To be relatable.
[0:53:11] <weirdee> but it's also boring yeah
[0:53:15] <+rdark_ksu> Jesse has been long time friends with CDPR peeps and been to Poland a number of times
[0:53:15] <Philslaya> I agree
[0:53:19] <Garthunox> TO INFLUENCE YOU DK!
[0:53:20] <%Luetin> Adding Influencers into games destroys any sense of immersion, I hate it 100%
[0:53:24] <arvidonfire> So is Keanu Reeves' character cool/interesting?
[0:53:24] <%norgthefish> Cox got the goodie bag @dkdiamantes
[0:53:24] <+LastHazzerd> to try and make folk clap when they see it
[0:53:26] <+Grayhammatter> marketing i guess?
[0:53:29] <Garthunox> Dont you feel influenced?!
[0:53:35] <$scootermccummins> Alanah Pierce and at least one other guy who’s name I forget at least
[0:53:38] <+MayorRev> i n f l u e n c e
[0:53:39] <aljegu> their communities now have more reason to buy the game, maybe?
[0:53:40] <fluxaga> does it just end up taking away from the depth of the game?
[0:53:43] <%commanderclaw> It ruins immersion is what it does
[0:53:44] <Philslaya> That walking game did it also and ad placements
[0:53:51] <@SarahTsang> i literally have no interest in those people
[0:53:52] <+Grayhammatter> doesn't really do anything honestly
[0:53:58] <%StillStuff> I literally don't know anyone except Keanu Reeves
[0:54:00] <Archangel735> they had too many cameos imo
[0:54:00] <Jobi_okino> I mean they used keanu as a big selling point, using youtuber cameos isn't surprising
[0:54:02] <+LastHazzerd> same reason they put the Akira bike in the game, dude
[0:54:03] <+Ghost_MSL> maybe CDPR just did it for fun?
[0:54:05] <weirdee> nah, it's not like, out of place
[0:54:12] <weirdee> it's just there
[0:54:12] <+LastHazzerd> just not appealing to you
[0:54:12] <Archangel735> maybe one or 2 is fine but theres so many
[0:54:14] <%Novalotus> The influence inclusion was right up there with the inclusion of jessica chobit in ME3.
[0:54:19] <+JBarkey> Ah, yes. Exposure. It can’t be used to buy food. But you can die of it.
[0:54:25] <JaceSaurrows> ...dukenukem forever level meh lol
[0:54:25] <+Promessa_EX> Pat says why aren’t I in this game I’m a bald redhead too
[0:54:29] <weirdee> i think i saw at least two other youtubers that i don't recognize
[0:54:29] <%norgthefish> @Luetin I would add cameo only by making it the sneakiest way. like one of the skaven grunts would be voiced by Criken
[0:54:30] <+Mrbaconator> i am having a lot of fun playing it
[0:54:32] <%Luetin> The world is lush to be in, thats why - the world carries the whole game
[0:54:36] <%weissguard> LUL
[0:54:37] <+toastybites> LUL
[0:54:43] <fullyloaded47> It's bad in a fun way
[0:54:49] <weirdee> i think it's jarring if you do recognize them
[0:54:51] <+uhjnlols> hi
[0:54:55] <weirdee> but if you don't, then you're gonna be okay
[0:54:59] <squiddy404> more bugs than railjack LUL
[0:54:59] <%Luetin> yeah I guess so @norgthefish Id probably be fine with that
[0:55:15] <+MoonbearXVII> It has the potential to be a 9/10 game if they fix and optimise it
[0:55:19] <@Lardcat> quiettSellout If you want to support and sport around awesome and amazing Shy merchandise, you can buy her items here: https://teespring.com/stores/qs-merch/ . Let the world know you wear awesome clothes! Additionally, Shy has some cool plates with her art on them at https://displate.com/shy/displates/ quiettCashmoney
[0:55:23] <%Firestorm49> Real question, is it fun enough to be Skyrim level where there's a ton of bugs but at least has fun aspects?
[0:55:28] <BeddoMakuramaru> I feel like cyberpunk is really good but the hype just leaves bad taste.
[0:55:28] <%PretzelRocks> Now Playing: Searching For a Lost Horizon by Scandroid -> https://prtzl.io/NaHQ43lXjd3Q5pfm
[0:55:36] <weirdee> like, i think the missions where you save people from the tyger clawz, at least two of them are youtubers
[0:55:46] <%StillStuff> I haven't put a single point in body. V is kinda an asshole regardless
[0:55:47] <Monkeyweed21> its like 15 minutes and 12 dialogue options
[0:55:48] <Archangel735> remember when they hyped up the background starts
[0:55:49] <+Cheese_Moon> I think its just the dialouge options
[0:55:53] <Solymr> so they did a me3 ending but at the start of the game?
[0:55:54] <weirdee> yeah i bet V doesn't change much
[0:56:09] <weirdee> you don't need body points unless you're gonna go full monke
[0:56:19] <+Mrbaconator> i don't think it's garbage, it fulfills it's function
[0:56:19] <Akuya4> wish driving was a bit better
[0:56:31] <%StillStuff> I run around for athletics
[0:56:36] <+Ghost_MSL> i still can't fathom why that epilepsy tester got put in the game?
[0:56:36] <weirdee> yeah the motorcycle is overall the best handling vehicle
[0:56:44] <Cyphereous> Jackie is a shaped like a friend, indeed.
[0:56:45] <weirdee> yeah i liked jackie and then they fucked it up lol
[0:56:50] <%StillStuff> Honeslty. He was the best character
[0:56:55] <%PretzelRocks> Now Playing: Nightfall by Fury Weekend -> https://prtzl.io/4JHK7Z7LayPDy8hO
[0:57:02] <%TehMud> Jackie was so good
[0:57:09] <Archangel735> idk why they decided to kill Jackie off in the beginning like wtf
[0:57:10] <weirdee> they blew that load too early
[0:57:17] <%GreatDane01> sounds like...when it works it works
[0:57:19] <%StillStuff> When Mama Wells called, I wanted to cry
[0:57:25] <%TehMud> I genuinely cared about Jackie
[0:57:34] <JaceSaurrows> V potato protagonist
[0:57:36] <%norgthefish> Grant theft auto with cyberpunk skin
[0:57:37] <weirdee> they were probably planning to have more characters later but then they didn't have time or VAs for it
[0:57:41] <weirdee> like way more
[0:57:45] <Archangel735> Jackie was great cause he wasnt edgy as fuck
[0:57:46] <Cyphereous> Didn't they try to say you could actually save Jackie too?
[0:57:53] <%Dmrfc> How's Cyberpunk on console?
[0:57:55] <%commanderclaw> Pretty isn't enough for me, I need to press a button and have it feel good
[0:58:01] <BettyMwwaahh> all the bugs arent pretty tho
[0:58:02] <weirdee> like i said
[0:58:12] <weirdee> they had plans that they didn't have dev time for
[0:58:22] <weirdee> also it's weird that you can't save him because
[0:58:26] <spongeofmystery> So it's Fallout 4 basically
[0:58:26] <AlbelDegurechaff> personally feel it should have been a wee bit smaller
[0:58:27] <Akuya4> Not even close
[0:58:28] <weirdee> the game doesn't confiscate your hypos
[0:58:31] <%TehMud> @Dmrfc A trainwreck
[0:58:33] <ZZaqwec> Gonna save up for a 3060ti before I get it
[0:58:36] <BinaryBetrayer> It's better to wait for february
[0:58:36] <+Grayhammatter> yikes
[0:58:38] <Archangel735> crunch doesnt work and only makes things worse
[0:58:41] <weirdee> you have like 98 hypos and you can't help him
[0:58:49] <squiddy404> i don't understand why the same people who hated TLOU2 worship cyberpunk bc it's worse in every way
[0:58:52] <@SarahTsang> i need to play Witcher 3 ...i have all the games....
[0:58:57] <%Luetin> Marketing Hype is one of the most damaging things in the gaming Industry - In fact I actually think this should act as a warning to other game devs - they would have been better off to not do all the crazy hype. Ppl would be far more forgiving
[0:59:02] <snow_found_a_gun> You have been alloted one(1) yike
[0:59:08] <HarmlessCrow> Pat's insane Witcher 1 is HORRIBLE to play
[0:59:08] <%Dmrfc> lmao, good thing im on pc
[0:59:13] <+Infernal_Dalek> What about Shadowrun? I've bought several of those games on sale but haven't touched any of them yet.
[0:59:14] <%StillStuff> I didn't like Witcher 3 tho.
[0:59:17] <%norgthefish> Difrence was that Wither 3 was not overhyped to the ground
[0:59:22] <+michingmallecho> Cyberpunk 2078 is going to be great though LUL
[0:59:28] <+moink1234> The story is so fucking confusing though. They introduce so many concepts with zero time to absorb the world
[0:59:36] <fullyloaded47> Hopefully they add some amazing dlcs
[0:59:39] <Archangel735> Cyberpunk 2076 poggers
[0:59:42] <+LastHazzerd> it didn't start until after Witcher 3 dlc
[0:59:44] <ratinox> Real production started when Mike Pondsmith was brought on board.
[0:59:46] <squiddy404> literally 2 consoles have been released since the start of developement
[0:59:49] <%commanderclaw> 2016
[0:59:54] <@SarahTsang> i love the hair in this , Shy
[0:59:55] <Toffol> Upgrades to the engine started on 2012
[0:59:57] <+The_iQue> I don't even understand why people worship TW3. I couldn't even make it 20 hours before stopping. That was in 2018.
[0:59:57] <%Dmrfc> Cheer100
[1:00:04] <+Cheese_Moon> Dk, you missed out
[1:00:07] <+HitchhikingThrough> Blood and Wine was absolutely incredible
[1:00:11] <+Cheese_Moon> The TW3 dlcs are amazing
[1:00:11] <@SarahTsang> @Dmrfc thanks for the bits !
[1:00:14] <%flumblum23> I remember the random CG trailer that was badass! Then when it all went silent, I lost all interest.
[1:00:16] <Monkeyweed21> 4 1/2 pat
[1:00:19] <@Lardcat> quiettCool If you like what you see, feel free to click the heart (♥) button up top on the right side of the stream to follow Shy here on Twitch! You can follow her on Twitter to stay up on updates about Shy at: https://twitter.com/quiteshallow . You can also follow her on YouTube at: https://youtube.com/quiteshallow/ quiettVerycool
[1:00:31] <weirdee> blame cdpr's marketers. they're the real scum lol
[1:00:36] <BettyMwwaahh> did anyone notice that all the early trailers where focused on those Super Cops? and then suddenly we only saw stuff on V and Keanu? wonder why that is lmao
[1:00:37] <%commanderclaw> I'm legit enjoying AC Valhalla more, cause at least that game is some fun junk food
[1:00:37] <~QuietteShy> hearts of stone was better than blood and wine, come at me assholes
[1:00:38] <Stepmans22> hyped up kinda like no man's sky
[1:00:40] <Solymr> now you can look forward to star citizen
[1:00:42] <+HitchhikingThrough> But Blood and Wine was the last DLC produced for what had become an incredibly polished and well recieved videogame
[1:00:43] <Toffol> DK, did you guys play around with stealth?
[1:00:45] <+HitchhikingThrough> O O F
[1:00:46] <%norgthefish> Could be worse DK. It could ended up like Duke Nukem Forever
[1:00:47] <Archangel735> CPDR fans still wont accept the game is scuffed
[1:00:48] <TheOgreKing> How do you not overhype something like Cyberpunk?
[1:00:50] <Monkeyweed21> is CDPR the new Bioware or the new Bethesda
[1:00:51] <%TehMud> Oh god
[1:00:53] <khyldr> most of the devs in leadership positions in Cyberpunk 2077 were working on TW3 and its DLCs.
[1:00:57] <%commanderclaw> Why would we come at you shy, you're right
[1:00:57] <@SarahTsang> people be like "this game isn't overhyped" ....m8 Keanu literally is in this game.
[1:00:58] <%dragonfooo> cheerwhal100
[1:00:59] <Cyphereous> @flumblum23 Very ironic because the whole song in that trailer was about "Personal Responsibility"
[1:00:59] <+dredgyboi> it's ok you can be wrong shy
[1:00:59] <Toffol> @QuietteShy Why tho? It's the truth
[1:01:10] <@SarahTsang> @dragonfooo thanks for the bits :3
[1:01:12] <%Luetin> quiettVaporlove quiettVaporlove quiettVaporlove
[1:01:13] <wibbwobbler> red spinner ftw
[1:01:14] <+HitchhikingThrough> @QuietteShy don't see how a packet of potato chips is better than a 3 course meal but you do you
[1:01:15] <+Ghost_MSL> for all the criticism about crunch if you want to see a game where you can tell how long and hard it was worked on - TLOU2
[1:01:16] <%Ilktheman> was mass effect good?
[1:01:19] <+MayorRev> I had to learn that lesson with Duke Nukem Forever
[1:01:23] <%TehMud> LUL
[1:01:26] <+HitchhikingThrough> WHO THOUGHT THAT?
[1:01:32] <+Grayhammatter> LUL
[1:01:33] <Akuya4> Andromeda is such a meme LUL
[1:01:33] <Toffol> The original trilogy is quite decent
[1:01:34] <MightyBran> Anything Bioware related, brace yourself
[1:01:35] <%TehMud> Silly DK
[1:01:35] <Solymr> speaking of mass effect
[1:01:43] <+HitchhikingThrough> Who actually thought Andromeda was going to be good after 3
[1:01:45] <%Firestorm49> I learned it with Mass Effect 3 ending as that disappointed the hell out of me
[1:01:46] <Bricky> I'm the only one I know who didn't hate that game lol
[1:01:49] <%PretzelRocks> Now Playing: Paranoid Empire by Doctor Vox -> https://prtzl.io/GjHAB1mZ2mEJ64UD
[1:01:51] <JimJamr> Any hype for the Mass Effect Remaster?
[1:01:54] <Solymr> is it worth playing or does it suffer from got ending effect
[1:01:55] <+HitchhikingThrough> And after learning it was part of a different studio
[1:01:59] <Archangel735> think critically
[1:01:59] <Toffol> 3 was a decent game still
[1:02:03] <Monkeyweed21> The 3 B's may soon be joined by 1 C
[1:02:04] <~QuietteShy> @HitchhikingThrough great fucking story told at a fast pace > shitload of open world drudgery
[1:02:04] <Toffol> Even with the shitty ending
[1:02:06] <Archangel735> dont let your emotions take over
[1:02:07] <%StillStuff> I didn't hate it.
[1:02:07] <+Cheese_Moon> The last thing i was hyped for was No Man's Sky, I learned my lesson back then
[1:02:08] <BeddoMakuramaru> Cyperpunk had no way of being as good as the expectations ppl had
[1:02:11] <%Luetin> Just be like me @DK - continually apathetic about all things - then everything is a net positive
[1:02:12] <Cyphereous> I bought Andromeda on sale recently for $10. It was worth $10.
[1:02:13] <%Bricky> Hey I give it like, a 5/10. Like, completely average lol
[1:02:16] <+MayorRev> By the way, Duke Nukem Forever's Director said that crunching devs is something that belongs in the industry, and he blocked everyone who mentioned that he directed Duke Nukem Forever.
[1:02:17] <+Katoma_115> another good example of overhype, Anthem
[1:02:18] <Dilettante> The multiplayer hurt in terms of actual fun
[1:02:19] <+rdark_ksu> expect nothing and you will never be disappointed
[1:02:20] <%TargetDummy_o7> TargetDummy_o7 subscribed with Prime. 
[1:02:21] <+MayorRev> pretty fuckin funny
[1:02:24] <Toffol> But after Anthem, how can you be hyped for a Bioware game nowadays?
[1:02:25] <weirdee> well, this is what i think: yall should fight for worker rights if you want your games done properly, but you won't, so
[1:02:26] <%Bricky> But nowadays anything under a 7 is considered the next ride to hell lmao
[1:02:26] <Dilettante> In comparison to ME3 Multi
[1:02:27] <+Cheese_Moon> Ever since I don't get hyped for any games, because I know it will end the same way
[1:02:27] <@SarahTsang> @TargetDummy_o7 <3
[1:02:28] <Arbutus__unedo> Andromeda was decent tbh; I think it would've gone WAY better with DLC
[1:02:33] <snow_found_a_gun> Honestly I'm glad CDPR delayed the game so *my* hype could die down
[1:02:33] <@SarahTsang> LOL VGA EUGH
[1:02:35] <+Ghost_MSL> the game I looked forward to the most in all my life was Master of Orion 3
[1:02:35] <+HitchhikingThrough> ITS THE CRUNCHIEST
[1:02:37] <spongeofmystery> @MayorRev holy shit
[1:02:38] <+Grayhammatter> the crunchiest
[1:02:38] <@SarahTsang> fuck the Last of us 2
[1:02:39] <Archangel735> SEPHIROTH THOOOOO
[1:02:40] <@SarahTsang> i hate that
[1:02:40] <%TehMud> I've learned to lower my expectations after many a Warframe update. Yes I'll dive in day one but I know full well there will be plenty of bugs.
[1:02:44] <BeddoMakuramaru> And probably no game will be as good as the expected cyberpunk2077 for the next 20 years
[1:02:46] <d3dm3n> game awards was a massive joke
[1:02:46] <+Ghost_MSL> and that was such a shit game
[1:02:46] <MightyBran> Nice to see Supergiant get a couple wins
[1:02:47] <Toffol> Tsushima was robbed
[1:02:48] <weirdee> THE CRUNCHIEST
[1:02:51] <%flumblum23> @Cyphereous Yup XD
[1:02:55] <squiddy404> best performance was poggers
[1:02:59] <%commanderclaw> The trailers and reveals were just okay this time too
[1:03:01] <Skeletonmanners> PERFECT DARK tho
[1:03:05] <Archangel735> Hades should've won
[1:03:07] <weirdee> hades was also robbed at every turn lol
[1:03:09] <+mMayrro> back 4 blood PogChamp
[1:03:12] <Cyphereous> Darktide is my big pick of the BGA
[1:03:14] <+Mr_Pylon> whatever that new Dead Space is
[1:03:14] <Cyphereous> VGA*
[1:03:14] <Monkeyweed21> they peaked with Sephiroth
[1:03:14] <Saltmeisterr> Season tho
[1:03:17] <@SarahTsang> Hades did win Best Indie Game though
[1:03:17] <%TehMud> Back4Blood is what interested me. I still love LEft 4 Dead.
[1:03:19] <%Ilktheman> DK how do you feel about the last of us 2
[1:03:21] <Toffol> The Horror game looked quite fun
[1:03:24] <+omegasis> MOTHERFUCKING MONSTER HUNTER THO
[1:03:24] <Archangel735> DARKTIDE LETS GOOOO
[1:03:26] <Solymr> singleplayer league of legends would be cool if only because hell is other people
[1:03:26] <+Promessa_EX> vin diesel corpse
[1:03:27] <Laecerelius> More Battle Chasers is always welcome
[1:03:27] <squiddy404> the elite dangerous odyssey reveal was so short :(((
[1:03:30] <weirdee> ruined king looks like a cross between two mobile games
[1:03:31] <%GreatDane01> Callisto thing looks cool
[1:03:33] <Cyphereous> Oh that reminds me. Get into the Alpha for Back4Blood if you guys haven't already. It's going up on the 17th
[1:03:33] <%irisillych> sephiroth killed mario quiettSuperdab
[1:03:35] <@SarahTsang> i'm down for Back 4 blood
[1:03:36] <BeddoMakuramaru> DK what about that sick Nier:replicant trailer?
[1:03:39] <Arbutus__unedo> @JimJamr I fear that the remaster will delete the charm Mass Effect 1 had for me; I even liked Mako and the combat (to some extent ofc)
[1:03:39] <bebemcgee696969> im liking CP2077 but i didn't jump on the hype train
[1:03:41] <AnneSQF> I hope B4B's characters are as fun as L4D's
[1:03:42] <Archangel735> @sarahtsang should've won best studio for not crunching tho
[1:03:45] <+rdark_ksu> Evil West seems fun cuz cowboy
[1:03:47] <%Razputin217> 13 Sentinels not winning best narrative is a crime
[1:03:48] <+Promessa_EX> mass effect pending title
[1:03:50] <%hotshotfighter> Wait are we talking about the Ruined King game? Like the one about league of legends?
[1:03:51] <+MayorRev> fuckin SEPHIROTH
[1:03:51] <Garthunox> The Left 4 Dead clones were strong
[1:03:52] <%StillStuff> Literally the only thing stopping me from playing league is league. Can't wait for ruined king
[1:03:53] <BettyMwwaahh> Turtle Rock also did Evolve tho
[1:03:58] <+Explain_Edd> Warhammer Darktide is looking pretty good
[1:03:59] <snekith> MH Rise?
[1:04:02] <Toffol> No papa nier tho FeelsBadMan
[1:04:03] <squiddy404> its cowboy DOOM
[1:04:03] <@SarahTsang> Last of us 2 winning best narrative LOL
[1:04:04] <+Cheese_Moon> I mean Replicant is out already, so
[1:04:04] <+Ghost_MSL> callisto scared me ngl
[1:04:05] <+MayorRev> Se-Phi-Roth~!
[1:04:08] <wibbwobbler> that's about it 4 me lol
[1:04:09] <%irisillych> needs Papa Nier over Brother Nier :c
[1:04:10] <Cyphereous> @AnneSQF Angry nerd pyromaniac is looking pretty funny. Supposedly there will be a bunch to pick from though.
[1:04:14] <weirdee> cp2077 has accidental enjoyment points but overall it's just a skeleton lol
[1:04:14] <Laecerelius> That Adromeda PREQUEL
[1:04:18] <Monkeyweed21> fake fan
[1:04:18] <%Kriss1827> they showed that gameplay at TGS this year
[1:04:27] <Cyphereous> Evil Dead looks better than it has any right to as well.
[1:04:28] <Archangel735> cant wait to finally play a fucking Imperial Guard
[1:04:31] <MightyBran> ^
[1:04:31] <%TehMud> Of course Sephiroth as well. Despite all the Ninty issues yeah I'm still gonna try Sephy in Smash.
[1:04:38] <+Grayhammatter> "best narrative" LUL
[1:04:40] <+Cheese_Moon> I'm hyped for Replicant, cuz i mean
[1:04:43] <+Cheese_Moon> its out already
[1:04:47] <%irisillych> I'm gonna rewatch mr.clemps for Nier lore
[1:04:47] <+Explain_Edd> the Dead Space clone... Project Calisto? I think, also looks pretty good
[1:04:50] <MightyBran> because FF7R probably
[1:04:57] <%irisillych> Disney owns Sora..........
[1:04:58] <+Promessa_EX> sora still meshes better
[1:04:58] <@SarahTsang> Sephy <3
[1:05:04] <AnneSQF> @cyphereous a big roster of survivors, huh? interesting!!!
[1:05:04] <Cyphereous> @Explain_Edd Set in the PUBG Universe.
[1:05:07] <+HitchhikingThrough> Have to mess with The Mouse
[1:05:10] <+LastHazzerd> it IS disney
[1:05:10] <$vincam2002> still hoping for dante in smash
[1:05:10] <BeddoMakuramaru> I feel like the FF7 remake was a part of that
[1:05:17] <HiImTiffers> you know what smash really needed? another swordsman xd
[1:05:19] <Solymr> sora is too op for smash obviously
[1:05:19] <%TehMud> Good luck negotiating with Disney

[1:05:19] <BettyMwwaahh> Sephiroth is the literal most recognizable bad guy for jrpgs
[1:05:19] <Cyphereous> Personally for Deadspace clones I'm looking at Negative Atmosphere more.
[1:05:22] <+MayorRev> BTW Disney did say No to sora
[1:05:26] <Archangel735> I feel like Disney would still want their products to be in a game
[1:05:29] <+LastHazzerd> and squeenix picked seph cuz Smash-vertisment
[1:05:29] <Monkeyweed21> Sora kinda needs Donald and Goofy with him at least a little
[1:05:31] <+HitchhikingThrough> 2B's Ass
[1:05:35] <BinaryBetrayer> Put Terra
[1:05:35] <@SarahTsang> @BettyMwwaahh he's my husbando
[1:05:42] <%PretzelRocks> Now Playing: Time Crime - Instrumental by Scandroid -> https://prtzl.io/lLHXbD4bLPvYXXIN
[1:05:42] <Garthunox> Square have the character rights for KH stuff but i bet its still Disney
[1:05:43] <Laecerelius> There's so many other Final Fantasies that you could put in as well
[1:05:47] <+HitchhikingThrough> Soraroph
[1:05:49] <Cyphereous> @AnneSQF Guy called Valve News Network had that rumor going around, it's a good channel for news.
[1:05:51] <+Promessa_EX> i don't disagree
[1:05:54] <fullyloaded47> Behemoth
[1:05:54] <MightyBran> Final Smash, Sue all characters on screen
[1:05:56] <Skeletonmanners> Sora was a dlc in world of final fantasy and he was time limited cuz Disney didnt let them have him for long
[1:05:58] <%flumblum23> ^
[1:06:03] <Cyphereous> 2B is not for good boys and girls.
[1:06:04] <+HitchhikingThrough> PUT HER MASSIVE ASS IN AS A CHARACTER
[1:06:04] <Archangel735> daily reminder that Donald Duck is the most OP mage in lore
[1:06:06] <+michingmallecho> I remember when Cloud and Squall were in kingdom hearts...feels like a 100 years ago

[1:07:13] <$vincam2002> I STILL WANTE DANTE
[1:07:13] <Cyphereous> @BettyMwwaahh Only if it's a Palico Prowler.
[1:07:20] <Solymr> add another fire emblem sword person
[1:07:21] <MightyBran> Shirtless Sephiroth LUL
[1:07:22] <%norgthefish> Sepheriah is THE ANIME MelleFIghter
[1:07:22] <+HitchhikingThrough> I live in pain
[1:07:25] <Darkmega97> @sarahtsang of course you do. You're a woman of culture

[1:07:28] <%irisillych> GIB DANTE
[1:07:31] <Zedimonx5> I want Vergil in because of marvel 3
[1:07:32] <Toffol> Another sword user tho D:
[1:07:40] <Monkeyweed21> Re4 Leon
[1:07:40] <MightyBran> Monster Hunter would make SO much sense
[1:07:44] <Cyphereous> Arthur would be pretty interesting.
[1:07:45] <%Ilktheman> backstab Zelda like he did to aerith
[1:07:46] <%TehMud> VIEWTIFUL JOE
[1:07:48] <+Promessa_EX> well ken was free
[1:07:49] <+HitchhikingThrough> WHERE'S PHOENIX WRIGHT
[1:07:49] <Cyphereous> Would play a lot like Mega Man I imagine.
[1:07:57] <SpookyBeef7> My problem is that Season 1 of Smash feels like it Sakurai's direct picks. Season 2 feels like the Corporate picks so far.
[1:07:57] <+LastHazzerd> the COMPANY has to care about the character too
[1:07:58] <Mechz71> DONTE IS GUD
[1:07:59] <+Promessa_EX> but ryu when we had megaman
[1:07:59] <+omegasis> WONDER RED CMON
[1:08:03] <fullyloaded47> They're adding monster hunter characters lmao
[1:08:06] <Sinderi> slapLurk
[1:08:11] <arvidonfire> Rayman
[1:08:14] <Cyphereous> We got Rise coming out and plenty more character slots to fill on the Pass. I bet it could happen.
[1:08:16] <Solymr> from the same game
[1:08:16] <Archangel735> Senator Armstrong for Smash when

[1:08:57] <fullyloaded47> Orange time
[1:08:59] <+LastHazzerd> oddly satisfying orange peeling
[1:09:02] <%StillStuff> As someone whose first ps3 game was Watch Dogs and still loves it, I like Cyberpunk and it's going in the list of games I like that other people hate. Along with Andromeda and Spiderman 3 on the ps2.
[1:09:02] <Zedimonx5> Why is Shy drinking paint?
[1:09:02] <%norgthefish> Shy's drinking coolaid.
[1:09:03] <+Caw_fee> Love your nails, got a color like that
[1:09:04] <Jobi_okino> I just bite the orange peel to form a tab to peel the rest
[1:09:05] <@SarahTsang> blue lipstick? :P @Thanatomy
[1:09:11] <big_tittie_anime_gf> my friend peels oranges/mandarins for me

[1:09:23] <MightyBran> Chew other peoples nails Kappa
[1:09:25] <+omegasis> how's the Genshin grind, DK
[1:09:27] <%TWolfJaeger> Shy's post-covid sense of taste is so blown she's to the point where she's dumping urinal cakes in her coffee.
[1:09:28] <Monkeyweed21> You can file down your nails by regularly giving a dog scritches
[1:09:31] <fullyloaded47> Mmmm crunch nails
[1:09:32] <spongeofmystery> Blue is a flavour

[1:11:23] <+Explain_Edd> Whatever is ij that coffee. I want 2
[1:11:28] <MightyBran> You'd incorporate it INTO a mixed drink
[1:11:28] <%norgthefish> Always wanted to try the "Finish breakfast"
[1:11:31] <BinaryBetrayer> Baileys in coffee is just Baileys
[1:11:35] <+Promessa_EX> star wars milik

[1:13:00] <Garthunox> SHE MUTES IT DURING CRITICAL ROLE!
[1:13:01] <Darkmega97> real question is, would you wear pants?
[1:13:04] <squiddy404> poor laura lol
[1:13:04] <+Promessa_EX> i can't wait for them to just call it mass effect
[1:13:05] <MightyBran> Mass Effect AND Dragon age. Definitely get yourself excited - it's gonna be greaaaaat...
[1:13:05] <BinaryBetrayer> I don't believe that Mass Effect thing will see the light of day
[1:13:09] <BettyMwwaahh> idk why anyone would have sound on their phone notifications
[1:13:11] <BinaryBetrayer> It's all a lie
[1:13:15] <+HitchhikingThrough> PLEASE DON'T SHUTTER OUR COMPANY EA PLEASSSSEEEE
[1:13:19] <@SarahTsang> I love Laura Bailey
[1:13:20] <%hotshotfighter> Jägermeister is my favorite whiskey
[1:13:22] <wibbwobbler> :(
[1:13:23] <Archangel735> where are they even gonna start off
[1:13:30] <snow_found_a_gun> Wild Turkey bourbon SeemsGood
[1:13:30] <+reagle_728> is bioware still behind it? is bioware still alive?
[1:13:34] <@SarahTsang> @hotshotfighter Jagermeister spice is great.
[1:13:36] <+HitchhikingThrough> I've never seen a more desperate cry for help
[1:13:39] <Cyphereous> Liara bad. Tali good.
[1:13:42] <BinaryBetrayer> Dk you should know better than to be excited for anything adjacent to Bioware
[1:13:44] <~QuietteShy> I FUCKING HATE LIARA
[1:13:44] <MightyBran> We're gonna bring Shephard back from the dead... again
[1:13:46] <squiddy404> Laura Bailey is amazing
[1:13:50] <ratinox> Maybe you love them DK. I... don't.
[1:13:55] <BettyMwwaahh> Liara got wrinkleys
[1:13:59] <+Grayhammatter> oh god
[1:14:00] <Archangel735> Tali >>>>>> Liara
[1:14:03] <BinaryBetrayer> NOBODY TRULY DIES
[1:14:05] <snow_found_a_gun> @cyphereous Reject Liara. Return to Tali
[1:14:06] <+Corvan> the search for shepard just like star wars
[1:14:07] <%Firestorm49> When all the writers that made it good left, that's a red flag
[1:14:07] <Toffol> Dragon Age with Varric narrating again FeelsBadMan
[1:14:10] <JimJamr> What ending is going to be canon?
[1:14:12] <Cyphereous> @MightyBran Control ending canon. Shepard possesses a Geth or Husk.
[1:14:12] <%irisillych> I'm glad I never got into mass effect
[1:14:13] <Laecerelius> I want to be a fucking alien this time
[1:14:14] <MightyBran> Big true
[1:14:15] <fullyloaded47> 2020Rivalry
[1:14:15] <arvidonfire> Liara made 16yo me very crush so hard
[1:14:21] <+TheCrispyBoi> """"""bioware""""""
[1:14:23] <Laecerelius> I'm tired of being human in this sci-fi game
[1:14:23] <GUDDAY12> liara best girl
[1:14:26] <BinaryBetrayer> Control Ending with time travel
[1:14:29] <+sonlascivious> It seems like it will be a prequel
[1:14:33] <MightyBran> @Cyphereous Let me play as a husk cowards! LUL
[1:14:34] <Zedimonx5> You gonna do that to my boy Joker?
[1:14:40] <+toastybites> imagine they bring back Ashley LUL
[1:14:40] <wibbwobbler> can't believe it's a direct sequel
[1:14:50] <spongeofmystery> They bring back Tali I'm throwing it in the fucking bin. Irritating genocide apologist
[1:14:51] <+HitchhikingThrough> I don't think development has started
[1:14:51] <Skeletonmanners> Mass Effect: Pls Rember
[1:14:52] <BinaryBetrayer> DK stop having faith
[1:14:57] <arvidonfire> STEVE
[1:14:57] <+RushUnplugged> it's gonna be 50years after, Liara is the only one alive because they live longer, calling it
[1:14:59] <squiddy404> what about the mobile just cause or whatever the fuck that was
[1:15:01] <~QuietteShy> liaras only lasting influence is futanari gifs on rule 34 websites
[1:15:02] <@SarahTsang> LOL
[1:15:02] <Archangel735> I just dont know how they're gonna do it
[1:15:06] <Solymr> ah, depression
[1:15:07] <+HitchhikingThrough> Like I ACTUALLY don't believe they have anything more than a whiteboard
[1:15:07] <+Grayhammatter> oh boy
[1:15:09] <@SarahTsang> Oh no
[1:15:14] <%PretzelRocks> Now Playing: Writing's On The Wall by Scandroid -> https://prtzl.io/wyHxGAWKGeb49MHV
[1:15:16] <+Promessa_EX> yes
[1:15:17] <+sonlascivious> the trailer talked a lot about the 1st contact war, so I think it won't entirely be the same crew
[1:15:18] <Archangel735> shy pls
[1:15:19] <@Lardcat> quiettAwww Everybody give some love to our wonderful, amazing, super special guest today! Hot take goblin lord and smol but loveable man, PatStaresAt > https://twitter.com/PatStaresAt/ & https://twitch.tv/PatStaresAt/ quiettVaporlove
[1:15:19] <weirdee> lol
[1:15:22] <Cyphereous> @RushUnplugged Except all the krogans should totally be alive too, lol
[1:15:24] <Laecerelius> Shy's not wrong
[1:15:25] <Ion_Laser> Skipping over ME: Andromeda is the correct response
[1:15:30] <MightyBran> Yeah, can you imagine getting both a Dragon Age AND Mass Effect trailer in one event and be worried instead of excited
[1:15:31] <ratinox> From the studio that ruined Mass Effect, Dragon Age and Anthem....
[1:15:37] <Darkmega97> Mass Effect 4 the Live Service MMO
[1:15:38] <Solymr> unfortunately
[1:15:45] <@SarahTsang> Andrameda
[1:15:48] <%Ilktheman> DK how do you feel about the last of us 2
[1:15:50] <Skeletonmanners> RETURN TO SHIT MOUNTAIN

[1:15:59] <wibbwobbler> shy giving me war flashbacks
[1:16:00] <+RushUnplugged> @Cyphereous they would, but Wrex is totally gonna bite it because krogans fight shit
[1:16:01] <Cyphereous> Kett killed everything. End of Andromahda.
[1:16:04] <%hotshotfighter> Mass Effect 4 the musical!!
[1:16:06] <MightyBran> lmao
[1:16:16] <%blistexthief> She's not wrong tho
[1:16:17] <Solymr> shy has gone places
[1:16:18] <JimJamr> Which is gonna be more fucked? Dragon Age or Mass Effect?
[1:16:22] <BinaryBetrayer> Everyone's Kinks
[1:16:22] <khyldr> lol
[1:16:22] <Garthunox> HELL YEAH
[1:16:23] <squiddy404> hmmmmm
[1:16:28] <+Promessa_EX> i mean, it's based
[1:16:29] <MightyBran> Is that why she's drinking blue milk?
[1:16:31] <Garthunox> Shy has great taste!
[1:16:35] <%TWolfJaeger> Mass Effect Remaster, but due to time constraints your only crewmates are Kaidan, Thane, Zaeed, Kasumi and EDI.
[1:16:35] <Monkeyweed21> oh please Futa is super common and vanilla
[1:16:36] <ratinox> @JimJamr "Yes".
[1:16:41] <Archangel735> she's trying to find that furry stuff
[1:16:41] <snow_found_a_gun> Love her or hate her, she spittin fax
[1:16:41] <arvidonfire> futa supremacy
[1:16:45] <weirdee> look, girlcock is a way of life okay
[1:16:45] <BinaryBetrayer> That's why she's drinking blue in her coffee
[1:16:49] <spongeofmystery> How the fuck did we start talking about this?
[1:16:53] <afronooch> tbf thats like 90% of the mass effect tag
[1:16:56] <MightyBran> A better ending?
[1:16:57] <wibbwobbler> LUL
[1:17:06] <+HitchhikingThrough> I feel like if she's seen it enough times to comment on it, that's too much to toss up to coincidence
[1:17:07] <+reagle_728> bro it aint a porn one up comp
[1:17:10] <fluxaga> ok chat bailey's is pretty awsome
[1:17:15] <MightyBran> They'll add a fourth colour
[1:17:17] <Arbutus__unedo> I fear more for Mass Effect; DAI was fine but MEA dropped in quality by a ton
[1:17:20] <+Halfsock> @TWolfJaeger yo i totally forgot kasumi was an actual character
[1:17:23] <Cyphereous> Hey, people like Thane though.
[1:17:36] <AnneSQF> Mass effect 4: time travel back and fix 3's ending
[1:17:37] <spongeofmystery> @MightyBran a yellow ending
[1:17:37] <Darkmega97> what percentage of Mass Effect's legacy is porn based?
[1:17:39] <Monkeyweed21> it was better than color edited CGI
[1:17:39] <%blistexthief> The new ending is Shepard taking a fully rendered poo for 20 minutes
[1:17:43] <+Dekaku> After Mass Effect: Androidmeda, prepare for the next installment - Mass Effect: iPhoneit in. Preorder now for USD 549
[1:17:43] <%Firestorm49> The fan made indoctrination ending was better
[1:17:49] <Archangel735> theres no way for them to move past the ending
[1:17:51] <Zedimonx5> More colors for the lasers!,
[1:17:51] <+arancet> forced cyberpunking
[1:17:58] <MightyBran> @spongeofmystery "Gonna do a piss run this time"
[1:17:59] <Cyphereous> Synthesis is just Indoctrinating everyone for the Reapers isn't it?
[1:18:04] <BinaryBetrayer> They can go back or around but never forward. Like a reverse minotaur maze.
[1:18:04] <+HitchhikingThrough> They aren't. They don't have a plan because this game doesn't exist
[1:18:27] <MightyBran> They'll have Shephard die, then pull a ME2 and rebuild him/her again maybe
[1:18:31] <Monkeyweed21> tell me about the Sheperd Grandpa
[1:18:35] <BettyMwwaahh> they already tried and fucked that up tho. Also i DONT wanna play as a human. give me an Asari or Turian mc option
[1:18:35] <BinaryBetrayer> No excitement allowed
[1:18:36] <Solymr> mass effect 3 good version
[1:18:38] <Zedimonx5> There’s always the first contact war
[1:18:38] <verlophia13> <3 <3 <3 <3 <3 <3 <3 <3 <3 <3 <3
[1:18:38] <%commanderclaw> Never be excited, only have cynicism
[1:18:43] <MightyBran> Oh god
[1:18:44] <Darkmega97> just trust in that "Bioware magic"
[1:18:45] <wibbwobbler> probably just pick an ending
[1:18:47] <Arbutus__unedo> Destroy will likely be canon because there are dead Reapers and destroyed relays in the trailer
[1:18:47] <spongeofmystery> Mass Effect 3's endings are exactly the same as the ending choices to Deus Ex 1
[1:18:48] <Archangel735> oh no
[1:18:58] <snow_found_a_gun> He right tho
[1:18:59] <+Grayhammatter> oh no LUL

[1:19:08] <%weissguard> Full of piss and vinegar, that there internet
[1:19:09] <+JavaManJoJo> Bunnyhop likes that gaem
[1:19:18] <Cyphereous> @MightyBran I would legitimately accept it if the Control ending was canon and Shepard just put himself in a robot body
[1:19:20] <%Ilktheman> everyone is entitled to their opinions
[1:19:22] <+Halfsock> mass effect 4 is gonna have a customizable mech suit component to make use of anthem assets

[1:19:36] <+Mrbaconator> it is a bit
[1:19:45] <BinaryBetrayer> @JavaManJoJo Bunnyhop likes Gone Home
[1:19:47] <Akuya4> V is also mostly cringe
[1:19:48] <+Dekaku> why not Synthesis?
[1:19:53] <Garthunox> you saved me 80 dollars pat, so thank you so much
[1:20:02] <MightyBran> @Cyphereous Some kind of shark jumping is needed, may as well have fun with it
[1:20:02] <+Grayhammatter> oh god
[1:20:08] <+Promessa_EX> yeah as someone with 300 hours in ac7, project wingman is my savior
[1:20:08] <%TWolfJaeger> @Halfsock Oh man wouldn't that be an awesome fakeout if the new Mass Effect is actually a reskinned Anthem 2.0
[1:20:09] <arvidonfire> millennial humor?

[1:20:21] <weirdee> well think about the title, it's also cringe
[1:20:21] <Laecerelius> It's way too constant
[1:20:25] <BettyMwwaahh> cringe is opinion. but they should just shut up
[1:20:27] <%hotshotfighter> this sounds great!!! quiettHA quiettHA quiettHA quiettHA

[1:21:10] <MightyBran> LUL
[1:21:15] <wibbwobbler> can't wait for ubisoft to get their crap together
[1:21:23] <$tenjenk> I would prefer Synthesis. Well actually I would prefer all endings to be incorperated based on our save game but that isnt happenning
[1:21:25] <bomi1995> oh...
[1:21:33] <spongeofmystery> But the word phoenix predates the Greeks so that's nonsense
[1:21:37] <Solymr> gimme another rayman game
[1:21:50] <BeddoMakuramaru> This is a perfect example of a game where it would be better if it had no narration
[1:21:52] <Solymr> a 3d game
[1:22:11] <+Promessa_EX> imagine if you jump in the lake and die from the velocity change
[1:22:18] <BettyMwwaahh> the gameplay is refined Breath of the Wild. dont know what pat is talking about. he just upset he spent $80
[1:22:32] <snow_found_a_gun> Ubisoft has been going down the shitter for years
[1:22:37] <%PretzelRocks> https://prtzl.io/KbHlJgpxeP7B99sW
[1:22:37] <weirdee> remember how the original game everybody was copying was shadow of the colossus and how that had almost no dialogue
[1:22:44] <weirdee> and how people enjoyed that game
[1:23:13] <weirdee> ubisoftman
[1:23:16] <Jobi_okino> So wait is this supposed to be peach? I thought I heard one of the lads say that
[1:23:16] <Solymr> can you blame asscreed for that?
[1:23:17] <Cyphereous> I wish the game that had gotten copied was Shadow of Mordor. We need more of that.
[1:23:28] <Monkeyweed21> the entire point of the BOTW towers is that they dont mark anything they just show you topography

[1:23:35] <Cyphereous> @Jobi_okino ye
[1:23:52] <Jobi_okino> Where's the pink then SwiftRage
[1:24:02] <MightyBran> Why are your dogs fighting?
[1:24:08] <+Grayhammatter> big snore
[1:24:10] <@SarahTsang> cutie
[1:24:29] <KeiganOfAstora> Just got here, what game?
[1:24:38] <%TWolfJaeger> Isn't that a documented aspect of game design, that players will automate the fun out of a game for maximum efficiency if able to?
[1:24:49] <+Promessa_EX> graphics wise... i gues the grass is nice
[1:25:04] <AnneSQF> lol that was me
[1:25:11] <%PretzelRocks> Now Playing: Future Frame by 3FORCE -> https://prtzl.io/X1HVdpdXYpxM3jCA
[1:25:14] <Jobi_okino> Low weapon durability means you get to try more things though
[1:25:19] <@Lardcat> If you would like to donate directly to Shy, click the Bit button (looks like a pyramid) on the right side of the chat bar. quiettCashmoney You'll need to purchase the bits, and then cheer# the amount you wish to give. quiettVerycool All donations are helpful and appreciated, no matter how big or small! quiettVaporlove
[1:25:19] <MightyBran> I think if they just toned it down a bit it wouldn't have been as big a deal
[1:25:36] <Cyphereous> I hate/love that island.
[1:25:37] <%Ilktheman> I find it upsetting in a sense that the master sword is optional
[1:25:46] <wibbwobbler> eventide
[1:25:50] <Saltmeisterr> eventide island
[1:25:54] <+Promessa_EX> it was kind of fun to break weapons on enemies and take their crap
[1:25:56] <+Dova573> Weapon durability was bad, but its not like getting more weapons that you couldnt even hold was an issue
[1:25:59] <+Pixel_Matt> I think Bunny Hop said it best that this game was made for kids
[1:26:11] <~QuietteShy> speaking of hate, i am one of the 3% players who collected all the tarot in cyberpunk, and guess what that does? NOTHING
[1:26:18] <+Promessa_EX> high end weapons would be nice to repair at least
[1:26:20] <Monkeyweed21> the 1 hit challenge on the Great Plateau was also great
[1:26:22] <squiddy404> ohhh that was super fun
[1:26:30] <Archangel735> wow sad
[1:26:32] <+Grayhammatter> wow
[1:27:02] <squiddy404> you have to kill a hinox but if you have the thunder champion power you can cheese it
[1:27:04] <Solymr> an achievement?
[1:27:10] <Cyphereous> Jacket made of out tarot cards.
[1:27:15] <+HitchhikingThrough> Collection for the sake of collection is a terrible idea
[1:27:21] <Archangel735> a shirt that just says I collected all the tarot cards
[1:27:22] <+Promessa_EX> how about a throwing cards weapon
[1:27:26] <+HitchhikingThrough> this has been known since assassin's creed 1
[1:27:35] <BinaryBetrayer> Achievements suck
[1:27:38] <Solymr> throwing dildos
[1:27:43] <@SarahTsang> @Solymr same, dude
[1:27:44] <Solymr> augh not the flags
[1:27:44] <+HitchhikingThrough> FUCK THAT THROW CARDS LIKE YOUR SETO KAIBA
[1:27:45] <weirdee> knives suck
[1:27:47] <Monkeyweed21> is there even 1 minigame in Cyperpunk?
[1:27:48] <+Promessa_EX> that's exactly what i'm talking about, gambit
[1:27:49] <khyldr> there's that in warframe, lmao
[1:27:52] <weirdee> cards? hmm
[1:27:54] <Archangel735> yugi yo arm card holder
[1:27:59] <+Grayhammatter> throwing cards like seto kaiba
[1:28:04] <Solymr> 400 fuckin flags
[1:28:10] <+Capta1n_H3nry> Need 2FA Mihoyo
[1:28:20] <%hotshotfighter> @SarahTsang who is this peach?

[1:28:28] <@Lardcat> quiettArtist Today, Shy is drawing, Paige aka PeachSaliva in the fashion of Cyberpunk! Please enjoy! quiettArtist
[1:28:31] <squiddy404> genshin looks nice but it's so unoriginal
[1:28:34] <Archangel735> cant even play the fucking arcade machines in cyberpunk smh
[1:28:34] <AnneSQF> LUL
[1:28:35] <Laecerelius> I gave up on it. It became a fucking chore to play.
[1:28:38] <Archangel735> you could in Yakuza
[1:28:44] <weirdee> it's not worth ranking up the final tiers because you need materials that take a week to farm lol
[1:28:44] <%TWolfJaeger> I would like Misty to read my tarot but she never actually pulls the cards from the deck, just plays the animation while gesturing to cards that clearly aren't there
[1:28:51] <BinaryBetrayer> Given Up on Genshin? More like Rehabilitated from.
[1:28:55] <Solymr> id have liked to try playing genshin but gacha stuff doesnt jive with me
[1:29:00] <Laecerelius> Genshin Impact is a fun game until it becomes a mobile game once you've explored everything.
[1:29:01] <+omegasis> did you see all the shit that went down with #ZhongliGate
[1:29:01] <Jobi_okino> I mean it's a chinese game that's free to play, how would you not expect that
[1:29:05] <%Ilktheman> DK is there anything that you would want/improved from genshin
[1:29:10] <Solymr> let me no life a game for whatever amount of time i want
[1:29:10] <+Promessa_EX> bruh
[1:29:15] <Archangel735> people mad that Zhong Li doesnt one shot people
[1:29:17] <+Cheese_Moon> absolute clowns
[1:29:20] <%norgthefish> Paimon is going to nickle and dime you because you couldn not stop saying that shes the emergency food
[1:29:24] <weirdee> wait what was zhongligate lol
[1:29:30] <Archangel735> fucking morons
[1:29:45] <+Promessa_EX> i'm glad as far as my play of that game, i'm like "amber is kind of cute that's nice" "cool, barabarra"
[1:29:53] <PretzelRocks> Now Playing: Future Bloodline - Instrumental by Scandroid -> https://prtzl.io/mLH9Zydjo7b4G3I3
[1:29:59] <Solymr> that happens in every gacha lul
[1:30:02] <%weissguard> people mad about zhongli not one shotting goons, cooking you food, AND doing your taxes!
[1:30:08] <Solymr> global shaft
[1:30:19] <@Lardcat> quiettArtist Today, Shy is drawing, Paige aka PeachSaliva in the fashion of Cyberpunk! Please enjoy! quiettArtist
[1:30:32] <Archangel735> the only thing I care about Genshin is the Beidou and Ningguang ship
[1:30:32] <weirdee> for the amount of money that it costs to unlock it
[1:30:33] <%toxic_waltzz> That's why you aim for waifus not stats
[1:30:44] <+Promessa_EX> das really dumbo
[1:30:46] <weirdee> that's probably why they're upset
[1:30:53] <Laecerelius> Yup
[1:30:59] <+Cheese_Moon> i got 2 zhonglis on my first pull
[1:31:07] <Cyphereous> Mad because he's not another waifu
[1:31:20] <Laecerelius> I'd imagine people saved their pity roll for him and then he wasn't as good as they thought
[1:31:22] <+Cheese_Moon> husbando*, excuse you
[1:31:34] <+Promessa_EX> yeah and very hillly kind of cool
[1:31:44] <+toastybites> I mean some Chinese gacha games like Arknights and GFL have great rates though
[1:31:47] <Archangel735> oh no
[1:31:50] <+eanscrale> Ohhhhh damn
[1:31:53] <@SarahTsang> what...
[1:31:55] <%norgthefish> HERESY
[1:31:56] <Nikmyth> Cyberpunk Paige ? Hell yeah
[1:31:56] <+Grayhammatter> wow
[1:32:00] <+Promessa_EX> that's stupid it's a video game
[1:32:01] <+HitchhikingThrough> LUL
[1:32:01] <Saltmeisterr> what?
[1:32:06] <AnneSQF> oh dear
[1:32:08] <%toxic_waltzz> china #1
[1:32:10] <Laecerelius> Sounds about right
[1:32:19] <+HitchhikingThrough> I love China. and by that I mean I hate China
[1:32:22] <Archangel735> oh jesus
[1:32:29] <weirdee> oh is that why wukong is OP in the chinese warframe lol
[1:32:29] <+toastybites> yeah its pretty fucked
[1:32:34] <%Ilktheman> why is everything political
[1:32:34] <BinaryBetrayer> You gotta love China
[1:32:36] <SpookyBeef7> Can we stop trying to cater to China?
[1:32:40] <+Promessa_EX> and isn't that character like an asshole and keqing is keeping him in check
[1:32:45] <weirdee> (granted he's OP in the main game now too but)
[1:32:46] <%Firestorm49> That sounds about right, you guys should know what happened to that Chinese MMA fighter showing up Kung fu fighters
[1:32:46] <Cyphereous> I feel like the Chinese always get uppity like that. "Why is our guy not the BEST guy?"
[1:32:54] <weirdee> lol get gud
[1:32:55] <+eanscrale> Ningguang is busted, and she's from Liyue.
[1:32:58] <MachetePhD> @SarahTsang So I finally managed to catch a sort-a summary-synopsis thing of your favourite game of 2020 Kappa
[1:32:58] <Saltmeisterr> i heard that his constellations are fucked up too
[1:32:59] <Archangel735> balls on Miyoho for standing their ground
[1:33:00] <+HitchhikingThrough> Hey congrats to them sticking to their guns
[1:33:01] <%weissguard> The Archons that are playable are literally not as strong as they were at their respective peaks though? Cause Zhongli and Venti gave up and lost their gnosis respectively?
[1:33:11] <+Grayhammatter> LUL
[1:33:16] <+Capta1n_H3nry> They might change him for 1.3
[1:33:20] <@SarahTsang> imagine spending £500
[1:33:31] <+Cheese_Moon> well venti didnt exactly "gave it up"
[1:33:37] <%norgthefish> Hey Pat. so what about peps that spend 15K on Spaceship in Star citymeme?
[1:33:41] <@MGlBlaze> Xu Xiaodong. Yeah it's pretty disgusting what they're doing to him. And he is self-admittedly only a mediocre MMA fighter
[1:33:42] <+omegasis> the community is absurd because the focus was so hard on Zhongli that there wasn't any focus on the account thefts/lack of 2fa
[1:33:42] <+eanscrale> c3 is optimistic
[1:33:50] <weirdee> i'm more mad that tortellini is like 1/10th of his actual power level and he's doing it on purpose
[1:33:51] <+Promessa_EX> venti got ganked
[1:33:56] <%weissguard> Yeah, hence why I included lost in there @Cheese_Moon
[1:34:03] <SaxStreaming> I think part of the Zhong hate is that both of his abilities don't work as good nor are reliable
[1:34:08] <%toxic_waltzz> WHAT
[1:34:09] <$vincam2002> wow
[1:34:15] <@SarahTsang> ....that sucks.
[1:34:16] <SaxStreaming> like the energy gain being RNG and stuff
[1:34:17] <Akuya4> lmfao
[1:34:17] <Saltmeisterr> what the fuck?
[1:34:18] <+Grayhammatter> oh god
[1:34:19] <+Promessa_EX> xu xiadong is super b ased
[1:34:19] <$vincam2002> that's scummy as fuck
[1:34:24] <BinaryBetrayer> You gotta love china
[1:34:24] <%toxic_waltzz> THAT is ridiculous
[1:34:25] <squiddy404> what the FUCK
[1:34:25] <Stepmans22> bruhh...
[1:34:25] <Akuya4> that is all levels of fucked
[1:34:28] <weirdee> damn, second class players
[1:34:32] <%CruciferousKale> LUL that is scummy but totally not surprising
[1:34:32] <Archangel735> jesus
[1:34:35] <+Capta1n_H3nry> The customer support messages can be rewritten by people with browser tools so idk how accurate that is
[1:34:36] <Cyphereous> Target free to play with 100 hours. Put $1 into it. Sell account for $20. Profit.
[1:34:37] <BinaryBetrayer> Only Whales Allowed
[1:34:37] <+HitchhikingThrough> wait, because they spent money, or because they spent MORE money?
[1:34:39] <%PretzelRocks> Now Playing: Transfusion by Occams Laser -> https://prtzl.io/a7HkDvjLOX27zWU7
[1:34:41] <AnneSQF> account security is a premium service
[1:34:43] <+KingGilbertIV> I mean there's a non-zero chance that guy bought that account
[1:34:43] <+Capta1n_H3nry> I only saw the one on Reddit though
[1:34:45] <+omegasis> naaah it was real
[1:34:45] <+Grayhammatter> bruh... that's awful
[1:34:46] <$vincam2002> yea fuck the devs on that
[1:34:59] <%CruciferousKale> What else would you expect from a developer whose business model is "gambling, but for kids too"
[1:35:04] <+omegasis> like, the whole subreddit in genshin became a game of telephone, where you couldn't tell waht was real and what wasn't
[1:35:06] <%toxic_waltzz> tbh it does sound like something those corporations might do
[1:35:15] <+Cheese_Moon> I mean, that's fucked, but they do make their money from gacha

[1:36:19] <Jobi_okino> Warframe LUL
[1:36:27] <+Cheese_Moon> Alright, chill dude
[1:36:29] <+Grayhammatter> me
[1:36:30] <SaxStreaming> Imagine thinking about Warframe
[1:36:34] <%Ilktheman> WARFRAME IS DEAD
[1:36:35] <$vincam2002> wats's a waframe
[1:36:36] <Cyphereous> Warframe isn't scummy or abusive generally. More just generally incompotent.
[1:36:40] <+Dova573> I beat Yakuza7 that was fun
[1:36:42] <Sinderi> waitframe
[1:36:44] <Mechz71> every Job excuse you Pat
[1:36:45] <Pappajimbo> even monk??
[1:36:47] <%Ba_ss> Pat's got a cool hat now
[1:36:50] <+HitchhikingThrough> I would like Warframe to go back to being OK/decent
[1:36:51] <$norgthefish> Lets speak about the other game. SYNTHETIK. a Labour of love game by 2 germans and it is about to recive Major Update in 3 days. game's good and I will not stop creaming over it.
[1:36:51] <@SarahTsang> I haven't played FF14 since 2018 ..
[1:36:56] <Monkeyweed21> and still refuses to do savage
[1:36:59] <+LiquidDinosaur> WHY ARE THESE FOOLS STILL BREATHING MY AIR
[1:36:59] <+skizzuto> Pat is the reason I got into FFXIV
[1:37:01] <%commanderclaw> I need to get back in and try the MNK changes
[1:37:04] <%norgthefish> it also has coop and teamkilling. so shy would have fun too
[1:37:04] <SaxStreaming> Operation will release, it'll be buggy, peeps gonna complain and DE is gonna take vacations right after it releases
[1:37:12] <%Dmrfc> Warframe community after the Khora LoS update LUL
[1:37:22] <weirdee> i suck at synthetik but i can appreciate it
[1:37:31] <~QuietteShy> i've been playing a lot of elite dangerous lately coz i got it free on epic and that game slaps
[1:37:33] <Huntercd> !uptime
[1:37:36] <Solymr> i havent followed any warframe stuff other than shy videos
[1:37:46] <%CruciferousKale> @SaxStreaming you got it
[1:37:48] <Yakobro> our crafter made hats for the whole static and now we all look like assholes LUL
[1:37:49] <Cyphereous> @weirdee And that's getting the big update too
[1:38:00] <Akuya4> @Solymr same lmao
[1:38:01] <Archangel735> space trucking
[1:38:03] <%PretzelRocks> Now Playing: Black To The Future by Fury Weekend -> https://prtzl.io/jDH8MeOLOpapBxI1
[1:38:08] <SaxStreaming> I got gifted Elite before it was free
[1:38:09] <weirdee> the channel has so much elite dangerous posting
[1:38:13] <Laecerelius> I watched German Spy play it a bit
[1:38:17] <weirdee> but there's no channels for it lol
[1:38:20] <+Cheese_Moon> Yeah, thats gonna be
[1:38:22] <+Cheese_Moon> A mess
[1:38:23] <@SarahTsang> I got it on Epic..but haven't played it
[1:38:23] <%TWolfJaeger> @QuietteShy I got back into Elite Dangerous since the bounty buff so now my murderboat's actually making money
[1:38:25] <Saltmeisterr> yes DK
[1:38:28] <+Grayhammatter> yes
[1:38:28] <Solymr> ive given up on playing warframe again
[1:38:28] <+HitchhikingThrough> God I fucking bought star citizen in 2014.
[1:38:29] <%hotshotfighter> warframe is not dead just in between big releases
[1:38:30] <+The_iQue> E:D is a bad game, fight me.
[1:38:30] <SaxStreaming> It ended up being too overwhelming for me so I stopped playing it
[1:38:32] <%Rancaliber_> @flumblum23 Didn't notice earlier, but thanks for the gift sub!
[1:38:34] <+Promessa_EX> with feet
[1:38:34] <+LiquidDinosaur> if they add actual walking around is the final nail in the Star Citizen coffin
[1:38:34] <Solymr> too depressed
[1:38:37] <~QuietteShy> yeah they are adding first person shooter stuff to it, it looks great
[1:38:45] <%Ba_ss> Gaming-general is the Elite Dangerous channel now
[1:38:47] <squiddy404> @QuietteShy join the alliance, we're pretty cool
[1:38:51] <+Promessa_EX> nah you've been able to land and drive a rover
[1:38:55] <+Cheese_Moon> You can land on planets with no atmosphere
[1:39:03] <%flumblum23> Gonna be doing better than Starcitizen
[1:39:03] <weirdee> shychat needs an elite dangerous channel :v
[1:39:05] <+Ghost_MSL> yup - ED had a showing of the fps at VGA
[1:39:07] <%commanderclaw> Boy is it, I backed it in 2012 and that shit is never coming out
[1:39:10] <+Cheese_Moon> Yeah the gunplay will split the fans up
[1:39:13] <squiddy404> shy has a discord?
[1:39:16] <@MGlBlaze> Elite Dangerous talk?
[1:39:18] <@SarahTsang> !discord

[1:39:19] <%CruciferousKale> Elite has a bit of fun but gets kind of repetitive
[1:39:30] <+Ghost_MSL> doing StarCitizen before StarCitizen
[1:39:35] <Archangel735> @mglblaze ye
[1:39:35] <+Promessa_EX> well it'd be nice to use a ship as close air support
[1:39:44] <squiddy404> I went to colonia and it almost ruined the game for me
[1:39:45] <+Cheese_Moon> Elite is not a game for everyone
[1:39:46] <squiddy404> don't do it
[1:39:47] <Cyphereous> Seems like a lot of people who were into Warframe are eying Outriders next. That sound about right?
[1:39:57] <weirdee> tbh the heat death of the universe could do star citizen before star citizen
[1:39:57] <@MGlBlaze> I like Elite. I dip in to it every now and then; I should get some of Saud Kruger's ships like Shy has done
[1:39:59] <@SarahTsang> @Cyphereous Outriders is fun
[1:40:06] <%norgthefish> I commited crime in Elite. could not pay it up on "where the fuck is that tab" and quited
[1:40:08] <Monkeyweed21> I still remember when players found alien life and immediately started harvesting it to extinction for money
[1:40:09] <+eanscrale> Well you need a house
[1:40:10] <%ShockzNDrawe> hey
[1:40:12] <Solymr> i can only play minecraft with other people now
[1:40:15] <wibbwobbler> back into ace combat rn
[1:40:15] <%Ilktheman> Minecraft is boring
[1:40:16] <squiddy404> i only have the tiny one
[1:40:16] <~QuietteShy> its eurotruck simulator IN SPAAACE
[1:40:17] <%toxic_waltzz> you gotta build the drilldo

[1:40:24] <weirdee> outriders also has a channel but not elite lol
[1:40:37] <Solymr> ive got no creativity for stuff on my own so
[1:40:39] <Monkeyweed21> no create only consoom
[1:40:43] <Archangel735> b i g
[1:40:50] <+The_iQue> Elite Dangerous has nothing to do past getting ships and seeing systems. It's really annoying that they don't add any actual content.
[1:40:51] <randorandy34> damn that looks good
[1:40:53] <+Promessa_EX> yeah best thing in elite dangerous was upgrading to my first freighter type and trading gold
[1:40:54] <Saltmeisterr> Pat lacks creativity and can't build for himself
[1:40:56] <@MGlBlaze> It's a 1:1 of the milky way galaxy

[1:41:36] <wibbwobbler> star citizen is waiting for technology to catch up
[1:41:42] <%TWolfJaeger> Elite Dangerous at the current rate of exploration would take about 450,000 years for the player base to explore every star system in the galaxy.
[1:41:43] <+Promessa_EX> back 5 blood

[1:41:56] <SaxStreaming> I loved how Elite just threw yourself into the deep space after the tutorial
[1:42:00] <beanslover> What's Y'all's opinion on Outriders?
[1:42:02] <+Promessa_EX> darktide looks so nice. i want to see shitty underhive

[1:42:20] <Jobi_okino> Wait so what about vermintide pvp that they promised, are they already working on a new game instead?
[1:42:20] <%Ilktheman> for a flying circus video y'all should play minecraft quiettHA
[1:42:26] <Cyphereous> Lady is probably Ecclisiarchy, not Mechanicus, Pat.
[1:42:35] <Saltmeisterr> wtf is adeptus machanicus?
[1:42:37] <Archangel735> whos the big guy though? I thought the Imperium didnt like mutants
[1:42:37] <MachetePhD> I HEAR ADMECH. PRAISE THE OMNISSIAH tacHyper
[1:42:39] <Cyphereous> She was praying to the God Emperor, not the Omnissiah
[1:42:41] <+LastHazzerd> of COURSE Pat is into mechanicus
[1:42:43] <Kitousha> Adeptus Mechanicus are the best. They don't need to poop.
[1:42:45] <+omegasis> whatcha tghink about that monster hunter trailer
[1:42:48] <Cyphereous> @Saltmeisterr Tech priests
[1:42:49] <Solymr> the machine fuckers
[1:42:56] <%PretzelRocks> Now Playing: Neon Road - Instrumental by PRIZM -> https://prtzl.io/OZH9VWo5adV3mDiv
[1:42:58] <+Promessa_EX> adeptus mechanicum and mechanicus
[1:42:59] <Cyphereous> Ecclisiarchy are the priests, not the toaster priests.
[1:43:00] <Saltmeisterr> ok
[1:43:00] <Laecerelius> Yeah the robed lady is Ecclesiarchy. They should have a skitarii, though.
[1:43:01] <~QuietteShy> add adeptus ridiculous to the game devs
[1:43:05] <+Cheese_Moon> that's an "ACKTHCUALLY" moment
[1:43:05] <squiddy404> you should play SCP: Secret Lab for a flying circus lol

[1:43:06] <$vincam2002> inquisitor
[1:43:09] <@MGlBlaze> DK was close
[1:43:16] <@SarahTsang> eclipse
[1:43:18] <+LastHazzerd> Pat "the flesh is weak" Toiletman
[1:43:23] <$vincam2002> bot fukers
[1:43:28] <Archangel735> best podcast ever
[1:43:35] <%ShockzNDrawe> Pat WOULD want to be a tech priest so he could replace his entire disgusting flesh body with a radiator and a roomba
[1:43:36] <Cyphereous> @Laecerelius Skitarii good.
[1:43:41] <MachetePhD> Speaking of AdRidic, I still like the fact that DK's little techpriest-character has giant metal cat-ears like the headset he's got LUL
[1:43:42] <$tenjenk> imagine having lucious the eternal as a boss monster
[1:43:43] <@MGlBlaze> The ecclesiarchy is basically the religeous branch of the human empire.
[1:43:53] <Cyphereous> @ShockzNDrawe No. Pat is a short Necron.
[1:43:58] <Pappajimbo> @Archangel735 Oygrns one of the "allowed" abhumans in the imperal guard
[1:44:01] <+Mrbaconator> ICHIBANS THE BEST
[1:44:01] <%norgthefish> I should Finish Yakuza-0 one day
[1:44:09] <weirdee> but hey, yakuza games on PC, it's coming :v
[1:44:13] <Stepmans22> can't w8 to play Y7
[1:44:18] <$tenjenk> I feel "hot mess" is a bit of an exageration tho
[1:44:20] <+Grayhammatter> jesus
[1:44:22] <+HitchhikingThrough> OK But they already had a functioning engine
[1:44:22] <Archangel735> @pappajimbo ooooh, thank you
[1:44:23] <weirdee> lol
[1:44:31] <Cyphereous> It'd be kind of cool to see footage from when Yakuza 7 was a beat em up
[1:44:36] <+HitchhikingThrough> And not just an engine, like proper systems and everything
[1:44:43] <$tenjenk> except if we look at the consoles which was predictable if you look at the min pc specs and look at last gen consoles
[1:44:46] <Akuya4> Yakuza 7 is amazing
[1:44:47] <+clouticus13> she had rona?
[1:44:49] <weirdee> "we were flying by the seat of our pants and it was glorious"
[1:44:58] <@SarahTsang> @clouticus13 yep
[1:44:59] <%norgthefish> so they changed into RPG. I think I am okay with that. since Beat them up was mostly "Mash button"
[1:45:00] <Dilettante> ... and they're cranking out 2-3 games a year
[1:45:12] <wibbwobbler> crunchamania
[1:45:14] <+clouticus13> ouuuff BibleThump <3
[1:45:17] <+toastybites> did they crunch it though is the question
[1:45:19] <@Lardcat> Hey everyone Shy, DK, and Bricky have created a podcast, Adeptus Rediculous! Where DK knows little about the WH40k universe, and Bricky knows way more, a light-hearted and comedic exposé about different topics is discussed and told. Check it out over at http://adeptusridiculous.com/ . It's available on almost every audio streaming platform there is; it's free; it's hilarious and yet witty. Check it out and enjoy it!
[1:45:20] <+Corvan> sega give that team the sonic license
[1:45:20] <Archangel735> I still gotta get Yakuza
[1:45:20] <weirdee> the yakuza games are like, the opposite of cp2077
[1:45:20] <+TheCrispyBoi> talk about a flex
[1:45:23] <%hotshotfighter> can get DK advertising Adeptus Ridiculous as a reward?
[1:45:27] <Cyphereous> Part of me hopes they continue trying new stuff other than Yakuza and make Binary Domain 2 or something.
[1:45:31] <+Orakan> whoever is talking he either has a very bad pc or he played cyberpunk on console cause he think cyberpunk is a technical mess
[1:45:33] <Zedimonx5> To be fair, Ichiban is a goof, he’s so damn good!!
[1:45:41] <SpookyBeef7> Is knowledge of the past Yakuza games necessary in order to comprehend what's going on in 7?
[1:45:42] <%asgard147> FailFish
[1:45:47] <Dilettante> klaigeChan
[1:45:49] <%CruciferousKale> Tater was playing that earlier - Lovecraft stuff
[1:45:57] <%Ilktheman> what is your favorite yakuza game dk
[1:46:03] <Cyphereous> Demo was good.
[1:46:04] <weirdee> cause like....the yakuza games actually give a shit about the neighborhoods they're inspired by
[1:46:05] <MachetePhD> Does Like A Dragon have the same absurdly ridiculous and comedic gold-mine of sidequests like the previous games?
[1:46:10] <%norgthefish> Nintendo big poopoo
[1:46:15] <weirdee> age of calamity is funzo
[1:46:17] <@SarahTsang> what's the yakuza game where the men are wearing diapers?
[1:46:22] <+Promessa_EX> it looks like fun and i think i love the sound
[1:46:25] <Cyphereous> @Ilktheman The correct answer is Dead Souls.
[1:46:30] <Archangel735> oh god
[1:46:34] <Cyphereous> @SarahTsang 7
[1:46:38] <Taryayel> adikdaHelo

[1:46:46] <+fxsonny> BibleThump
[1:46:47] <+RushUnplugged> @SpookyBeef7 there's references to older games but 0 knowledge required for the main plot
[1:46:49] <MachetePhD> Which game?
[1:46:51] <Saltmeisterr> it is not optimized
[1:46:52] <ryushifdh> BibleThump
[1:46:57] <+Promessa_EX> nintendo needs to get a mobile processor that isn't a joke tegra
[1:46:57] <Cyphereous> Though there was at least one guy in 0.
[1:47:06] <@MGlBlaze> oof
[1:47:08] <MachetePhD> Oh, the new Hyrule Warriors thing?
[1:47:09] <+Grayhammatter> oof
[1:47:11] <@MGlBlaze> Gross

[1:47:55] <+fxsonny> greetings from Argentina btw GlitchCat
[1:47:56] <Cyphereous> I still hope we get a Windows 10 gaming tablet thing that's basically just a ripoff Switch like the Alienware UFO. I love that setup and want a mobile Steam machine for indie/older games.
[1:47:59] <+Promessa_EX> sadly the tegra x1 sucked when switch was announced
[1:48:00] <ryushifdh> :)
[1:48:04] <AnneSQF> guess I shouldn't play it on my Lite then :P

[1:50:51] <+Grayhammatter> DQ11 is awesome

[1:51:55] <Monkeyweed21> also AoC is 100% getting DLC characters since Purah and Robbie have playable voice lines in the files

[1:52:04] <spongeofmystery> Just got back, oh man Shy that looks amazing!
[1:52:12] <+Grayhammatter> the 2D mode is nice
[1:52:22] <%r_xanadu> Wish I could say the same for Ni No Kuni 2. Such amazing art wasted on mediocre art and a forced mobile mechanic
[1:52:31] <weirdee> but the whole of japan plans a holiday on every release for a reason
[1:52:41] <BinaryBetrayer> I'm not even sure if Amplitude can be called Indie anymore.
[1:53:00] <+Promessa_EX> dragon ball big green dub
[1:53:03] <BinaryBetrayer> Do they have a deal with Sega or did Sega eat them?
[1:53:06] <Saltmeisterr> "such amazing art wasted on mediocre art" ?????
[1:53:07] <Laecerelius> It's amazing
[1:53:12] <%Ilktheman> @DKDiamantes what game do you want to see remastered
[1:53:14] <+Promessa_EX> super space warriors

[1:53:15] <@SarahTsang> oh no
[1:53:20] <squiddy404> bri ish voice acting
[1:53:20] <+Spr1ggs> moon2D
[1:53:25] <MachetePhD> @SarahTsang So I saw that sort of plot-synopsis thing about your favourite game of 2020, but it wasn't a full on playthrough so I obviously missed a lot of the scenes and details, but got the basic gist of the story...
[1:53:28] <weirdee> robust autobattle has been a feature in many jrpgs for a while
[1:53:30] <%NeedlesD> Yangus was the best
[1:53:40] <Laecerelius> Ark 2 with fucking Vin Diesel
[1:53:43] <@SarahTsang> @norgthefish Vin Diesel, dude

[1:53:53] <Laecerelius> Teh Fast and the Unga
[1:53:57] <@SarahTsang> @MachetePhD it 's stupid innit
[1:53:58] <weirdee> ah, DQ loves their incredibly bad accents

[1:54:04] <spongeofmystery> "I slept loik a baby"
[1:54:05] <+RNGbob> ME N MY BIGLEY WIGLEY BOYS ARE GONNA GETCHA
[1:54:05] <Archangel735> I cant wait to pull off sick drifts in Ark 2
[1:54:08] <ratinox> The Xenoblade games were dubbed in England.
[1:54:08] <%norgthefish> @SarahTsang Hell yea. now we need ROCK DWANE JOHNSON

[1:54:18] <Cyphereous> Past and the Furious
[1:54:19] <%asgard147> limesLUL
[1:54:32] <Laecerelius> The most surprising fucking reveal in the VGAs
[1:54:33] <BinaryBetrayer> Who gives a shit about ARK 2
[1:54:34] <@SarahTsang> Imagine spending all your money on those actors
[1:54:34] <+Promessa_EX> it's so bad. i'm glad coco is happy
[1:54:41] <@SarahTsang> but on Ark
[1:54:43] <MachetePhD> @SarahTsang As a GAME, I don't know if it's 100% bad because obviously I didn't see a PLAYthrough, I saw a summary. But the story... It is definitely not something that's enjoyable. It's... painful
[1:54:43] <%norgthefish> "We didn't finished ARK instead released DLC after DLC. TIME FOR ARK 2
[1:54:44] <Archangel735> WHERES ELDEN RING
[1:54:47] <Archangel735> OOOOOOOH
[1:55:01] <Saltmeisterr> WHY DO THEY HAVE SOME MUCH MONEY?
[1:55:02] <BinaryBetrayer> Imagine spending all your money on anything else but your game
[1:55:03] <JimJamr> But what if it's the Sequel to the Riddick games!
[1:55:15] <@SarahTsang> @MachetePhD exactly
[1:55:18] <Cyphereous> Aside from that. How about Arkvatar: The Last Expansion? Because that show looks like a horrible version of Korra.

[1:55:30] <MachetePhD> I forgot Elden Ring existed
[1:55:32] <Archangel735> OOOOOOOH ELDEN RING
[1:55:32] <+Promessa_EX> man
[1:55:37] <Cyphereous> Elden Ring descended into Wooper Watch.
[1:55:38] <BinaryBetrayer> And nothing was mentioned about Elden Ring again
[1:55:43] <Laecerelius> Oops! Revealed it waaay to early!
[1:55:46] <%norgthefish> what the fuck is Elden ring?
[1:55:50] <+fxsonny> where can I exchange my points for a quiteshy glyph ?
[1:55:50] <~QuietteShy> @DKDiamantes u saw lucas tweets? He was the voice actor for that thing and they replaced him with vin diesel
[1:55:52] <JimJamr> Open world Dark Souls
[1:55:52] <+Promessa_EX> it's an assasin's creed
[1:55:55] <MachetePhD> Elden Ring is... Nordic dark-souls written by George R R Martin?
[1:55:56] <Archangel735> its probably a viking version of Dark Souls
[1:55:59] <Cyphereous> @norgthefish Norse Souls
[1:56:06] <wibbwobbler> still waiting for deep down honestly
[1:56:10] <@SarahTsang> oh man that sucks
[1:56:17] <Archangel735> LOOK UP TO THE SKY
[1:56:21] <Archangel735> IT BUUURNS
[1:56:26] <+Promessa_EX> they decided to say it existed for some reason
[1:56:28] <BinaryBetrayer> Speculate away
[1:56:35] <Huntercd> I am glad they are having a bad time
[1:56:38] <Cyphereous> Well Dark Souls 3 was supposed to be kind of like that since it had the create a bonfire mechanic initially.
[1:56:38] <weirdee> i bet they saw keanu and were like "we gotta get our aging 90s movie star too!"
[1:56:40] <squiddy404> i'm mainly excited for Avowed because I loved the Pillars of Eternity games
[1:56:52] <%toxic_waltzz> wow what the fuck
[1:57:05] <+Promessa_EX> it makes sense since it looks like they just pasted vinn diesel face on a rigged animation
[1:57:10] <%norgthefish> @Cyphereous Do you have the slightests idea how little does this narrow it down?
[1:57:13] <@SarahTsang> David Tennant ...Elliot Page...
[1:57:15] <Laecerelius> WAAAAY too much talent for an Ark animated series
[1:57:15] <%weissguard> That's where the budget for that is going.
[1:57:22] <BinaryBetrayer> Imagine hiring all those voice actors instead of funding your own game
[1:57:24] <JimJamr> Gerard Butler and Russel Crow

[1:57:31] <+Grayhammatter> LUL

[1:57:41] <Skeletonmanners> remember fucking ATLAS
[1:57:42] <+eanscrale> ARK is really popular overseas
[1:57:44] <+Promessa_EX> arc people like it
[1:57:47] <%norgthefish> they will get bored and move on
[1:57:51] <%norgthefish> AS THEY USUALY DOO
[1:57:53] <Laecerelius> I always figured Ark was a game that was barely profitable
[1:57:58] <weirdee> @BinaryBetrayer cp2077 available at your local retalier!
[1:58:01] <squiddy404> there's no story for ARK how do you make an animated series

[1:59:10] <%norgthefish> Someone will mod the shit out of ark to add Vin disel oil
[1:59:13] <Laecerelius> Have you guys seen the videos of people showing off the real time shadow of your character showing how fucking janky their model is?
[1:59:13] <BinaryBetrayer> I'd say CP2077 had no problem with money, but it was a management and development shitstorm
[1:59:15] <weirdee> yeah the tiger claw bikes are nice
[1:59:24] <%norgthefish> ARK Modding community is the blessing in this shit of a game
[1:59:25] <@SarahTsang> I saw a lot of tweets about the Ark stuff and they were like "no one asked for this"
[1:59:39] <%norgthefish> they once made fully working Monster hunter mod. only for it to be soo good it got C&D
[1:59:47] <+Promessa_EX> guns are terrible
[1:59:49] <spongeofmystery> Wait wait wait say that gun crafting thing again
[1:59:52] <weirdee> uh, the only way to get high level crafting mats consistently

[2:00:23] <Zedimonx5> Yeah gorblins!!!
[2:00:23] <%norgthefish> jamesSEAL
[2:00:29] <weirdee> all the other crafting parts are useless *until* you get the material fusion perk
[2:00:35] <Saltmeisterr> YOU'RE BRAIN, RUN BY GOBLIN
[2:00:35] <Laecerelius> Pull it out and BEAT IT.
[2:00:55] <weirdee> and the only reason to take crafting is to make uniques
[2:01:04] <weirdee> and blueprint only weapons
[2:01:04] <%Firestorm49> God that goblin annoying in any bethesda game
[2:01:08] <spongeofmystery> What's the final boss of OCD
[2:01:15] <Laecerelius> Ugh
[2:01:26] <%asgard147> ...realy?
[2:01:26] <%weissguard> ah hell. That'd get me good.
[2:01:33] <weirdee> the final boss of OCD is gacha games
[2:01:36] <wibbwobbler> pain
[2:01:38] <spongeofmystery> So there's no point to upgrading stuff
[2:01:38] <Kitousha> auto-disassemble was a godsend for me.
[2:01:42] <%norgthefish> ARK Animated was also very unrealistic. I would loot the shit off that knight-man
[2:01:56] <$Ella_Mental> negaPride veiH
[2:01:57] <weirdee> doesn't autodisassemble only work with junk
[2:02:03] <weirdee> and not the guns
[2:02:04] <Huntercd> nyannBlush nyannHmm
[2:02:14] <+Grayhammatter> oof
[2:02:17] <+LastHazzerd> good bgm for the stream
[2:02:20] <%Midashu> 16 in tech
[2:02:28] <weirdee> for some reason mods get permanently attached unless you smash them with the perk
[2:02:30] <weirdee> it makes no sense
[2:02:36] <BinaryBetrayer> It's almost as if crafting was designed and conceived back when the game wasn't scalled back in 2017
[2:02:38] <%hotshotfighter> what game is this?
[2:02:41] <weirdee> and there's no real point to salvaging mods anyway????
[2:02:56] <Kitousha> @weirdee yeah. but i was going insane before it, because i didn't want to auto sell it and i'd spend minutes manually disassembling everything before that.
[2:03:04] <weirdee> like you'll get better mods too
[2:03:09] <+Promessa_EX> plus you become bald in mirrors
[2:03:21] <+ArmoredDeath> I got the Japanese helmet. it looks sick with a good mask
[2:03:21] <weirdee> the other thing about junk autodisassembly
[2:03:32] <weirdee> is that some junk is worth 700 eddies
[2:03:36] <weirdee> and it will crush those too!
[2:03:39] <myndstrip> @hotshotfighter Cyberpunk 2077 i assume
[2:03:50] <+Eaglestrike117> Man, you dont even HAVE to go back to the apartment to do that even. Cause you can just access your stash by going to the trunk of V's car. WHich means you can use the car as a literal storage wagon

[2:04:27] <weirdee> weapon mods are easy to get from vendors tho, they're not expensive until it's like
[2:04:31] <weirdee> epic/legendary
[2:04:32] <BinaryBetrayer> The game would melt the switch right off your hands
[2:04:33] <Huntercd> nyannBLEGH
[2:04:33] <$vincam2002> it would be 15FPS

[2:06:25] <+LastHazzerd> it's not an MMO, so why
[2:06:34] <+LastHazzerd> What??
[2:06:36] <Skeletonmanners> DS 3 had the server test
[2:06:45] <BettyMwwaahh> They did an Alpha for Bloodborne and DS3
[2:06:48] <Saltmeisterr> its not multiplayer?
[2:06:50] <Monkeyweed21> they do stress tests
[2:06:51] <+Promessa_EX> i like how i get the butcher knife in the dark soul and that's the end
[2:06:52] <Jobi_okino> Dark souls 3 servers LUL
[2:06:53] <+Onionchamp> they've done network tests in the past
[2:06:55] <sendart> did they ever announce it had multiplayer?
[2:07:12] <+LastHazzerd> ooooh they've done server tests, that makes sense
[2:07:13] <+ironkeroro> fromsoft did multiplayer tests for DS:remaster too
[2:07:13] <Jimmyla> why is shy still using Fidget Spinner in the end of 2020?
[2:07:15] <Jobi_okino> From software servers have always been terrible because of regional matchmaking and netcode or lag comp

[2:07:58] <+LastHazzerd> it feels like for a brief time game companies thought it was a good idea to drop title cards for game projects they've not actually started
[2:08:06] <wibbwobbler> spinners r cool
[2:08:06] <%hotshotfighter> Fidget Spinners are a tradition on this stream
[2:08:06] <BettyMwwaahh> the had previews for Bloodborne, Sekiro, and DS3 for content creators. they probably will for Elden Ring

[2:11:52] <+Promessa_EX> sounds like tarkov
[2:11:53] <myndstrip> @hotshotfighter saw it during the gameawards so the title of the game wasn't immediately obvious/announced

[2:15:31] <$tenjenk> there are certain crafting, etc lulls that people dont want to see on lulls
[2:15:33] <SpookyBeef7> Can't even do that, because Persona fans will throw a bitchfit because you're not playing a specific Persona game.

[2:15:42] <Akuya4> Agreed! Yakuza 7 is generally just awesome

[2:35:26] <+Promessa_EX> 1 inch you still see grass and most dog poops
[2:35:29] <@Rozalyndis> DK, -1C = 1 degree below freezing
[2:35:33] <@Rozalyndis> 0C = 32F
[2:35:36] <gluemanofficial> -1 is pretty bad, but if there's no wind it's managable
[2:35:39] <fluxaga> no snow sticking in Indiana so far
[2:35:41] <Dilettante> It depends on kind of snow
[2:35:49] <Dilettante> You can get slushy hardpack at 1 inch
[2:35:58] <+QuantumArthier> how much is 0F in C?

[2:37:54] <%ShockzNDrawe> winter tires with 4 wheel drive helps but it doesn't mitigate it completely

[2:37:57] <@Rozalyndis> are you kidding? people in cali can't drive up a gentle incline

[2:39:23] <%xAilinel> ign: xAilinel platform: pc
[2:39:26] <shurtal> Montreal drivers are bad, because there's not enough road taht isn't under construction for people to have a chance to learn
[2:39:46] <%ShockzNDrawe> See here, if you don't know how to drive, you will quickly lose your liscence
[2:39:49] <@Rozalyndis> montreallers LOVE jaywalking
[2:39:51] <@Rozalyndis> it's a problem
[2:40:03] <+Promessa_EX> it's hecking expensive to drive in japan
[2:40:05] <Jobi_okino> @NoHoldsBarredProductions no one likes quebec drivers here in ottawa
[2:40:11] <+JavaManJoJo> I'd always rather have that overly safe driver. My brother drives a little crazy and I usually get tense riding with him. He's totaled a car taking and off ramp too fast before and just a couple weeks ago he almost had us slide off a snowy mountain.

[2:43:12] <+Capta1n_H3nry> Holostars
[2:43:13] <@MGlBlaze> 70s has a vtuber avatar
[2:43:14] <jorniev> takahata
[2:43:18] <Archangel735> Nyanners is so cursed and I love it
[2:43:18] <Huntercd> nyannBlush nyannHmm
[2:43:22] <Mr_Bitterness> Hololive has a whole set of guys
[2:43:33] <%LeoDrakoniX> DK, BROZIME HAS A VTUBER AVATAR
[2:43:33] <+TechTurtle7> winning son roberu says hi
[2:43:36] <Tecion010> i have only seen two male vtubers Brozime and 70s
[2:43:39] <weirdee> "i look like an insane homeless person" - pat
[2:43:43] <@MGlBlaze> I'm not opposed to the concept of vtubers but for some reason I find a lot of the personalities of the ones I've seen grating.
[2:43:48] <+Promessa_EX> your favorite female vtube could be male and that's fun
[2:43:54] <Laecerelius> Pat looks like he's gonna attack me with a used needle
[2:44:00] <l0rd_love> he hasnt seen a male vtuber period, coz males dont have periods duhhh
[2:44:15] <+Promessa_EX> ^
[2:44:16] <@MGlBlaze> Humanity sucks.
[2:44:19] <+JavaManJoJo> they get the fun process of getting harassed for looking too good and not good enough!
[2:44:29] <weirdee> it is sad but everybody just lets it go!
[2:44:42] <%LeoDrakoniX> WTF LUK
[2:44:47] <%LeoDrakoniX> LUU
[2:44:49] <weirdee> because nobody ever tells them no
[2:45:00] <%LeoDrakoniX> FUCK...
[2:45:03] <@Rozalyndis> my issue is people would see me as the vtube girl but then if twitchcon rolls around and i have to make an appearance the magic is lost forever and they see how hideous i am
[2:45:04] <Laecerelius> Pat you'd have to use Remerai's model of you for your Vtubing
[2:45:07] <Huntercd> nyannNyan nyannNers toilet review
[2:45:10] <wibbwobbler> plenty of female streamers without anime avatars
[2:45:12] <+Dionide> is shy because she's shy? or shy is shy because she is shy?

[2:45:31] <+QuantumArthier> the story of CP2077 is bad?
[2:45:31] <Saltmeisterr> THE TRANSHUMANISM SUCKS TOO
[2:45:40] <Saltmeisterr> NO ROBO PENIS
[2:45:42] <elvespelves> Dont get aboard the hype train guys...
[2:45:43] <+Promessa_EX> it died
[2:45:43] <@Rozalyndis> deus ex did transhumanism better
[2:45:47] <Jobi_okino> It seems there's a bunch of Nyanners fans in this chat, with content like Shy's I guess that's no surprise
[2:45:49] <BinaryBetrayer> @rozalyndis the secret is that everyone is disgusting
[2:45:51] <weirdee> you know what transhumanist dream game would have, actual trans- (gets disconnected from internet)
[2:45:52] <Mr_Sparcler> not so far atleast
[2:45:54] <jorniev> at bare minimum it was supposed to be a good game
[2:45:58] <@MGlBlaze> Human Revolution was amazing aside from the boss fights
[2:45:59] <%TWolfJaeger> @Rozalyndis Amen
[2:46:21] <marc_of_age> Expectations are kinda hurting the hell out of the gaming community
[2:46:22] <%Dmrfc> No Man's Cyberpunk
[2:46:23] <MachetePhD> SOMA was a great game for transhumanism themes
[2:46:27] <Mr_Sparcler> it is a good game, best or lived up to the hype? no
[2:46:32] <+MoroseLoki> Deus Ex is pretty good. yeah
[2:46:36] <+HitchhikingThrough> Or New Vegas
[2:46:37] <Archangel735> rip Anthem
[2:46:39] <Laecerelius> Well Skyrim also has mods to fix it
[2:46:41] <BinaryBetrayer> is mankind divided good?
[2:46:44] <+HitchhikingThrough> LUL
[2:46:45] <+HitchhikingThrough> I DON'T
[2:46:49] <Tecion010> people still talk about anthem?
[2:46:52] <Bacon_Rage> it's like hyperscape :jer
[2:46:53] <jorniev> did it happen with fallout 76?
[2:46:54] <+GuiIded> Anthem NEXT is taking so long it is going to upset me like Cyberpunk did most people
[2:46:56] <+HitchhikingThrough> I HOPE ANTHEM CONTINUES TO SMOULDER
[2:46:58] <Saltmeisterr> What potential LUL
[2:46:59] <+Dionide> they made a Anthem 2.0 and it's still shit
[2:47:01] <Archangel735> I forgot about Anthem ngl
[2:47:02] <GarbageNirvana> I blame WB
[2:47:05] <%ninnokabin> ninnokabin subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 9 months! Dk, Pat, Poor Rebecca is not very good at Final Fantasy 14. bless her
[2:47:06] <+TechTurtle7> lets hope it reaches"ok"
[2:47:07] <+Promessa_EX> i have trouble remembering anthem
[2:47:10] <weirdee> SOMA feels like bush league tbh
[2:47:13] <Akuya4> potential to be worse is all I can see
[2:47:18] <@Rozalyndis> i want us to have living examples of shit
[2:47:18] <jorniev> WHAT HAPPEND WITH MAKIND DIVIDED?
[2:47:21] <+MoroseLoki> yeah never did part two of deus ex
[2:47:21] <+GuiIded> @Dionide They didn't make Anthem 2.0, its still being made wym
[2:47:21] <Mr_Sparcler> it is more fun than witcher 3 imho, and that counts for something
[2:47:23] <Saltmeisterr> @Bacon_Rage OH MAN hyperscape is something
[2:47:24] <TheWashoutXY> Bioware is dead. Sad since im a DA / ME fan
[2:47:27] <GarbageNirvana> oh wait Anthem
[2:47:28] <weirdee> like it's a tourist to out of body, uncanny valley
[2:47:30] <@Rozalyndis> we keep having this problem of trying to erase the past
[2:47:30] <Solymr> maybe if they release a game that was good from the get go
[2:47:42] <weirdee> nobody really digs into the themes
[2:47:50] <Laecerelius> We need WorfFrame, with real barrel combat action
[2:48:05] <BinaryBetrayer> I had already forgotten avengers existed
[2:48:12] <%PretzelRocks> Now Playing: 2517 by Scandroid -> https://prtzl.io/W1HgBPmG791jGMfw
[2:48:13] <Bacon_Rage> everyone forgot hyper scape jermaPluto
[2:48:16] <weirdee> destiny's "success"
[2:48:22] <@Rozalyndis> anthem's all "hold my beer"
[2:48:24] <snow_found_a_gun> That's a fair take. Anthem is a shit game and BioWare has gone on the decline, but the "looter shooter" category does need more competition for the games involved to actually improve.
[2:48:28] <bananax_bananax> cool
[2:48:37] <%ShockzNDrawe> It's just "Get biggest number" and that's literally it at it's simplest all to it
[2:48:51] <weirdee> destiny somehow went even lower than warframe lol
[2:48:53] <+Dionide> destiny is cool nowadays
[2:48:59] <BinaryBetrayer> Is there anyone left in the Anthem playerbase? Is there a community, or events, or roadmaps or any kind of organized?
[2:49:02] <+GuiIded> Anthem's concept is amazing, they just need to give it the content to go with it
[2:49:07] <+HitchhikingThrough> stop trying to be the next "X"
[2:49:11] <+HitchhikingThrough> No one has ever done it
[2:49:15] <+HitchhikingThrough> and it always ends badly
[2:49:18] <+Promessa_EX> Overwatch 2!
[2:49:18] <%blistexthief> Get hype for Dawngate y'all
[2:49:24] <Solymr> i completely dropped destiny for personal reasons
[2:49:32] <BinaryBetrayer> @HitchhikingThrough Making something new is scary to investors though!
[2:49:39] <squiddy404> there's usually one game that does it and the rest fail
[2:49:41] <snow_found_a_gun> Same.
[2:49:44] <weirdee> it's cool *now*, but destiny is still a burning ship like warframe
[2:49:45] <MoonWatcher21> Destiny wasn't even that good
[2:49:45] <%ShockzNDrawe> it's not hard to be better than destiny
[2:49:48] <wibbwobbler> i guess those games had subscription models for a reason lol
[2:49:48] <+Dionide> destiny has Beyond Light rn and it's really nice
[2:49:50] <%ShockzNDrawe> and yet here we are
[2:49:50] <weirdee> it's just to what degree it is on fire
[2:49:56] <+HitchhikingThrough> @BinaryBetrayer you think they'd be more scared of an option that has always failed
[2:49:59] <+Dionide> @weirdee damn right
[2:50:09] <%r_xanadu> Wanna be like WoW? Failed, LoL? Failed. GTA? Failed. Street Fighter? Failed? Destiny? Failed. Call of Duty? Failed.
[2:50:15] <+omegasis> just make monster hunter clones, all of those are p good to decent at worst

[2:50:29] <%r_xanadu> What about NOT chasing the Big Dollar in the sky?
[2:50:32] <+Dionide> but man i was hyped for anthem, i even thought about preordering it, but after it launched .... bruh
[2:50:33] <weirdee> and everybody trying to copy that success is a ship even more on fire and incomplete
[2:50:43] <retnab1> what is sunsetting?
[2:50:43] <BinaryBetrayer> @HitchhikingThrough Yeah, you'd imagine that enough sunken ships on the horizon would warn people not to sail through those waters, but here we are.
[2:50:48] <@MGlBlaze> Forsaken was pretty sweet, the first couple of seasons were good, then they decided to go full FOMO and I don't want to play any more.
[2:50:58] <@Rozalyndis> TO BE FAIR
[2:51:05] <COLDSNOWKILLER> Sun setting fucked up the game hard.
[2:51:06] <the_Zinith> The fact that all shadowkeep moon gear is UNUSABLE is idiotic
[2:51:10] <weirdee> they don't care if game succeed, they just want money
[2:51:15] <weirdee> that's our problem
[2:51:19] <+MayorRev> this is looking great so far!
[2:51:27] <+Dionide> @mglblaze get Beyond Light, it's lit, and you can use Darkness powers now
[2:51:29] <@Rozalyndis> 98% of ALL pve, not pvp, PVE loadouts. 98% of all loadouts were three things: mountaintop, recluse, anarchy
[2:51:37] <+MayorRev> is this a big surprise for paige or is she aware of it :o
[2:51:44] <@MGlBlaze> @Dionide How about... no.
[2:52:00] <+Dionide> BibleThump
[2:52:05] <@MGlBlaze> Destiny made me hate Destiny.
[2:52:08] <%r_xanadu> The best part of Destiny IMO is the first day a raid comes out. Otherwise, it's a very odd grind trying to find a better version of the gun you already have
[2:52:19] <BinaryBetrayer> Perhaps they removed it to make people try more content
[2:52:24] <+Dionide> lol yeah it does have that power
[2:52:29] <+GuiIded> I lost all motivation to play Destiny after they finally forced players to have to start tossing items
[2:52:41] <@MGlBlaze> I love how Shy is using chalks to make a glow for the lighting
[2:52:47] <@Rozalyndis> what i wanna know is how the hell we have gambit and pvp matches on titan and mars
[2:52:52] <Zakurn> @binarybetrayer they removed it to force people to grind more
[2:52:53] <%PretzelRocks> Now Playing: Quelle Suprise by Occams Laser -> https://prtzl.io/4JHK7oglkvGpAKTO
[2:53:01] <%r_xanadu> Funny enough: Destiny 2 launched with a system which was a bit similar to Warframe, where each gun had set rolls, but you could set up mods for each weapon.
[2:53:11] <weirdee> yeah that some good visual blur
[2:53:13] <BinaryBetrayer> Games as a service was a mistake.
[2:53:14] <+Zaagada> congrats on the recovery Shy!
[2:53:26] <@Rozalyndis> neither of which offer pinnacles anymore!
[2:53:28] <@Rozalyndis> by the way
[2:53:31] <Cyphereous> Heard that both DLCs you can STILL BUY do nothing now since their locations got locked.
[2:53:40] <wibbwobbler> cyberpeach
[2:54:15] <Solymr> games as a service is like internet of the things
[2:54:18] <weirdee> wow
[2:54:24] <%r_xanadu> The issue is with... everything else about the changed weapon slot system. 2 primaries, snipers and shotguns as Power weapons, consumable mods. It was a mess for 3 years
[2:54:25] <weirdee> so how about dem games
[2:54:29] <+HitchhikingThrough> what
[2:54:32] <%norgthefish> aka 'Fuck you everyone who bought Season pass"
[2:54:35] <+Dionide> @cyphereous those DLCs were removed since Shadowkeep, the game went free together with both first DLCs yknow
[2:54:35] <$Mr_Stabby_101> @Cyphereous Even better than that. The DLCs are REQUIRED to get the newest content, from what I understand. You need to have Shadowkeep and Forsaken to be able to get Beyond Light
[2:54:40] <%flumblum23> Well yea, to make way for the season pass and drip fed nostalgia weapons!
[2:54:51] <+QuantumArthier> why is there no good online game? XD
[2:54:56] <+Promessa_EX> dqXI has a demo so pat has now gotten me to try
[2:55:01] <+MayorRev> sunsetting means that good gear gets weakened and outdated over time yeah?
[2:55:17] <Mr_Bitterness> You also get mad XP for running old FF14 raids through the roulettes

[2:55:28] <%r_xanadu> The issue with Destiny's content is most of the content requires a lot of platforming, so most of the areas are very large
[2:55:31] <+Dionide> @mr_stabby_101 nah you can just buy Beyond Light
[2:55:47] <@Rozalyndis> FOMO
[2:55:49] <Monkeyweed21> Transmog will also cost silver/ bright dust
[2:56:03] <@MGlBlaze> I'm pretty much exactly in the same spot as Pat
[2:56:05] <@Rozalyndis> they wanted to get rid of it. but went harder into it than ever
[2:56:09] <weirdee> yeah fomo is shit
[2:56:17] <+Dionide> imagine playing looter shooters
[2:56:19] <+HitchhikingThrough> oh that's what fomo is
[2:56:27] <%flumblum23> They lost me for sure.
[2:56:29] <%PretzelRocks> Now Playing: No Longer Human by DEADLIFE -> https://prtzl.io/a7HkDLzLd9bGMzi7
[2:56:30] <COLDSNOWKILLER> Destiny is "I want to have fun with the game but the game wont let me have fun and punishes me for it."
[2:56:46] <$Mr_Stabby_101> @Dionide I remembered Bungie saying that, but then I heard a bunch of people complaining you needed the DLCs to get BL. I stopped playing at the beginning of the Season where Saint came back, so Idk
[2:56:51] <MoonWatcher21> Oh, I played destiny for a week but had to leave and now I don't even wanna go back
[2:56:51] <%r_xanadu> FOMO is the reason why I dropped Divisoin 2. I have the expansion, and I haven't touched it since before the second raid came out
[2:56:55] <wibbwobbler> less art more product on the sliding scale
[2:56:55] <@Rozalyndis> i hear snoring
[2:56:57] <Mr_Bitterness> Only thing you miss in FF14 is seasonal events
[2:56:58] <@Rozalyndis> quiettAwww
[2:57:03] <weirdee> so is the lesson that we should all just go to ffxiv
[2:57:07] <%norgthefish> SNORE
[2:57:08] <@Rozalyndis> ZANGIIIIEEFF
[2:57:09] <+MayorRev> giefy sleepy
[2:57:10] <%blistexthief> Is that the pig dog I hear?
[2:57:20] <@SarahTsang> cutie
[2:57:20] <+BuriasDempsey> that's a loud ass snore
[2:57:26] <%norgthefish> rbzSleeper rbzSleeper
[2:57:29] <+Grayhammatter> the biggest pig dog sleep
[2:57:38] <%r_xanadu> Meanwhile, Borderlands 2 came out years ago, and it's still better than most Destiny clones
[2:57:43] <+Dionide> warframe also doesn't know how to make new players stay
[2:57:52] <@MGlBlaze> FOMO has indeed made sure I've basically left Destiny forever, btw
[2:57:58] <@Rozalyndis> whisper has been neutered to shit
[2:57:59] <Ehrine> You can still get those weapons though via a terminal in the tower
[2:58:00] <Monkeyweed21> hey that was me
[2:58:14] <weirdee> fun fact: fo76 runs entirely on fomo and it literally has a fomo joke in the game
[2:58:15] <@MGlBlaze> And FOMO in general can very quickly turn in to "I don't even want to bother any more" for me.
[2:58:41] <%norgthefish> WE DONE
[2:58:46] <+Dionide> why is there an ahegao shy emote?..
[2:58:48] <weirdee> but it has fomo to the extent that they're actively shooting themselves in the foot with their clumsy attempt at monetization
[2:58:55] <@Rozalyndis> why not? quiettAh
[2:58:57] <+MayorRev> this looks great!!!
[2:59:00] <weirdee> because their model doesn't actually work
[2:59:02] <+MayorRev> show paige!
[2:59:03] <Archangel735> @dionide why not
[2:59:08] <+Dionide> filipeBota
[2:59:12] <%r_xanadu> Crap. Forgot about that. Also, some of the Exotics from the Season Pass are just gone. The Arrivals grenade launcher is just gone if you didn't grind up to rank 35, and it's been used in tons of raid speedruns as of late it's so good
[2:59:12] <%CruciferousKale> Great drawing

[3:03:15] <@Lardcat> Hey everyone Shy, DK, and Bricky have created a podcast, Adeptus Rediculous! Where DK knows little about the WH40k universe, and Bricky knows way more, a light-hearted and comedic exposé about different topics is discussed and told. Check it out over at http://adeptusridiculous.com/ . It's available on almost every audio streaming platform there is; it's free; it's hilarious and yet witty. Check it out and enjoy it!
