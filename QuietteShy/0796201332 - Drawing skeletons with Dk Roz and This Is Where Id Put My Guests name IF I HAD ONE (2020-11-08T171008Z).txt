[0:06:33] <@MGlBlaze> It had two! The second one was japan-only, though
[0:06:33] <+HaZineHan> I only remember peachsaliva from gripes' video XD
[0:06:33] <+WizoSavage> oh the e-card reader bs?
[0:06:36] <%Megamorphton> yes, there was an actual TCG videogame for pokemon
[0:06:39] <%Megamorphton> and it was in-depth
[0:07:06] <%spongeofmystery> What happened to our special guest star?
[0:07:09] <@MGlBlaze> There is also an online pokemon TCG client that is active right now if you wanna play it now, too.
[0:07:10] <%norgthefish> spooktime
[0:07:15] <%AzureZebraKZ> Thanks @Lardcat
[0:07:30] <Huntercd> Magic art is on point
[0:07:31] <+neo_slayer> HI SHY! Thank you for the entertaining content
[0:07:31] <%norgthefish> I am toom uch of a start so Shy wrote me off
[0:07:35] <@MGlBlaze> CRAW WURM
[0:07:36] <+BRC_Del> The online pokemon TCG was absolutely insane
[0:07:37] <%Eckos84> Choo Chooo HypeChimp
[0:07:39] <%Megamorphton> I heard chameleon, and immediately had Monster Hunter Chameleos PTSD
[0:07:45] <+neo_slayer> hope you have a nice day and stay safe
[0:07:48] <%A7roboBOT> I remember that one
[0:08:00] <%zurigasungama> I played the Pokemon TCG incorrectly because I couldn't fathom that energy was supposed to be in your deck.
[0:08:01] <MoonWatcher21> Yo
[0:08:02] <@MGlBlaze> Nah, Craw Wurm is pretty bad lol. But it was one of the earliest big creatures.
[0:08:05] <%StarchDornan> StarchDornan subscribed at Tier 2. They've subscribed for 14 months, currently on a 14 month streak! 
[0:08:14] <@MGlBlaze> 6 mana for a vanilla 6/4 is a bad deal.
[0:08:15] <toxic_waltzz> Sounds useful but why lol
[0:08:18] <%AzureZebraKZ> Spanish?
[0:08:26] <+BRC_Del> @zurigasungama That was literally everyone in my school so I understand
[0:08:34] <Archangel735> those cards are really pretty
[0:08:35] <Huntercd> Wurms and slivers freak me out
[0:08:38] <Ada_the_Mesa> Arro! :D
[0:08:40] <%norgthefish> We should send DUO to DK so he can finally learn
[0:08:43] <Kutakai666> heh.
[0:08:48] <%Bravokado> My wife and I just started playing Pokemon TCG together, we're having fun with themed decks at the moment ;)
[0:08:49] <aphrafen> Craw Giant ftw!
[0:08:50] <%blistexthief> Yo soy DK
[0:09:00] <%norgthefish> or get naynay'ed by green owl. either way a win
[0:09:02] <%Eckos84> Yu Gi Oh was at least a pretty solid card game in the early years, but then they just kept making so many new rules and metas that i just got burnt out of trying
[0:09:11] <@MGlBlaze> Yeah, craw wurm was in the original sets.
[0:09:27] <tharongale> I always struggle with the scapula region of the back.
[0:09:30] <%A7roboBOT> Yeah, the old creatures were kinda weak
[0:09:32] <%AzureZebraKZ> "That's alotta damage"
[0:09:36] <+theammostore> Best card ever printed: Brash Taunter
[0:09:38] <@MGlBlaze> Balance was much different; creatures all sucked and the designers didn't consider that having to spend a shitload of mana on something was already a downside on its own.
[0:09:43] <+BRC_Del> Yeah MTG has been power-creeped pretty hard, seven mana can get you a 6/4 flying trample doublestrike and that's on the bad side
[0:09:44] <%spongeofmystery> DRAG him later
[0:09:48] <+theammostore> Recent card, but it's the best ever
[0:09:52] <%PlagueOfGripes> how embarrassing
[0:09:56] <+WizoSavage> Pat was born to oversleep
[0:09:56] <%blistexthief> Commence shade throwing

[0:12:45] <+Sirsquizz> get this man a redbull
[0:12:46] <%r3dray88> @archangel735 nothin much, started up some personal writing and finished Mass Effect 1
[0:12:53] <%PlagueOfGripes> I was curious why you were streaming yesterday when you had this scheduled
[0:12:54] <darkshadow012049> @theammostore i have one
[0:12:54] <+BRC_Del> @darkshadow012049 You can use one to spin at like 450 rpm in osu! if that helps
[0:12:58] <%blistexthief> Is Pat having Disc Room withdrawals?
[0:13:02] <r_xanadu> How's everyone else here? Anyone else mess up baking something extremely easy to make like chocolate granola?

[0:13:27] <%AzureZebraKZ> Thanks Pat
[0:13:32] <mike2hands> pat should be dying wth
[0:13:33] <%PlagueOfGripes> You can mute individual things on discord, Pat
[0:13:37] <Ashidan> Imagine muting discords LUL
[0:13:39] <umbracatalyst> Where’s Pats Purple Heart
[0:13:46] <+WizoSavage> sometimes muting them doesnt work cause they still ping you
[0:13:47] <%PlagueOfGripes> ( Like the conversation I set between all three of us that he muted )
[0:13:56] <r_xanadu> @BRC_Del since I just did that myself. It tastes so bad, and I feel like filth now
[0:14:04] <%PlagueOfGripes> a great policy for responsible adults
[0:14:05] <%r3dray88> ye, gonna finish the original trilogy first
[0:14:06] <+BRC_Del> "I muted every single thing" DnD mode exists
[0:14:19] <%PlagueOfGripes> he's gotta mute discord so it won't wake him up
[0:14:23] <+BRC_Del> @r_xanadu That's fair, not every shot at cooking is a success
[0:14:27] <%PlagueOfGripes> because it would never wake him up
[0:14:30] <toxic_waltzz> Maybe it did but you missed it?
[0:14:31] <%AzureZebraKZ> Yeah you can mute servers individually, but what I don't get is how do you stop the mentions?
[0:14:35] <mike2hands> we're making something for peach saliva?
[0:14:36] <Archangel735> alarm also got muted
[0:14:46] <Dremora45> Oh wow. That's sexy

[0:21:55] <WEGEST1> my brain is bad right now
[0:22:04] <AncelDeLambert> there is video PROOF of Paige saying four years ago that she'd name this type of dog Zangief
[0:22:09] <sir_deadlock> So Shy's art has always been masterful. Is this her process? First she draws the bones, then the circulatory system, then the organs, then the muscles, then the skin, then the hair, then the clothes?

[0:29:00] <sir_deadlock> Scalpers, man. I wish scalpers were illegal.
[0:29:23] <MurphyGoodGuy> scalpers scare you?
[0:29:41] <%spongeofmystery> quiettNoice
[0:29:43] <hagbard_celine_5> dem bony hips are extra thicc
[0:29:48] <%ThePabe> misheard that and thought "skeletons are illegal" and got sad
[0:29:49] <%irisillych> ticket scalpers are one thing, but resellers are another :T
[0:29:52] <councilmechanica> After hearing that PS5 is bottlenecking almost every PS4 game, I'm not upset about not getting one at launch
[0:30:06] <$pedr0lx> nice skeleton 4ss
[0:30:15] <sir_deadlock> I heard that one guy who bought a ton of hand sanitizer for resale got in trouble. Not sure what happened to him.
[0:30:16] <sidthegato> Spooky sexy skeletooons send boners down your paaaants~~
[0:30:19] <councilmechanica> They clearly slapped in the backwards compatibility at the last second and it works like crap rather than boosting it so fuck that
[0:30:20] <+StefanUltr4> LUL
[0:30:29] <SirGO0SE> Roy was nuts
[0:30:54] <Archangel735> he got arrested right
[0:30:56] <SirGO0SE> there are compilations of just his goalie fights that are a dozen minutes long LUL

[0:31:14] <@MGlBlaze> It is very funny when the rare situation comes up that scalpers get screwed over, though. Doesn't happen much, though.
[0:31:17] <SpookyBeef7> Oh yeah, I remember hearing about that story. I imagine he verbally got his shit kicked in.
[0:31:18] <hagbard_celine_5> Wasn't it like $30k in sanitizer?
[0:31:22] <councilmechanica> No, he didn't get arrested. He also went and hit up every store in the tri-state area.
[0:31:24] <SirGO0SE> yeah not to be a downer but he has abuse problems @Archangel735
[0:31:24] <melluster> !glyphs

[0:31:32] <%iamnotjex> my experience with hockey is basically trolling my friends that enjoy it by telling them its not a real sport
[0:31:32] <%spongeofmystery> Like the guy who wrote a bot to push up the price of 3080 reseller auctions
[0:31:43] <@SarahTsang> Internet historian is one of my faves

[0:31:56] <%MaxCrazyDude> Hrllo all ^^
[0:32:02] <Archangel735> idk theres like a lot of stories of those people
[0:32:02] <@MGlBlaze> Like scalpers with the original PS2 launch having to deal with a lot of returns due to faulty hardware. Same for the 360. Or an announcement of additional runs of product making their stupid stockpile tank in value.
[0:32:04] <+jimthebingle> the ads on twitch are gettin bigger

[0:32:57] <iamnotjex> that skull on shy's table is a better guest than pat
[0:32:58] <@MGlBlaze> Price gouging involves a crisis situation
[0:33:00] <+thereisneverenoughdakka> HI PAT
[0:33:04] <TheDefectiveSp00n> It's like porn. You know it when you see it.
[0:33:08] <%PlagueOfGripes> I'd rather listen to the sharpie noises than Pat's wretched bellowing

[0:33:38] <@MGlBlaze> @Rozalyndis (see last message)
[0:34:00] <%PlagueOfGripes> "law enforcement is more of a feeling really" - judge
[0:34:01] <sidthegato> Pricw gouging is when you look at the price and say F uck this
[0:34:01] <melluster> when is a new glyph available?
[0:34:18] <Archangel735> W O W
[0:34:26] <mike2hands> @PlagueOfGripes LUL LUL LUL LUL
[0:34:43] <Omega_Guardian> price gouging. Like uh video card and cell phone prices for the last half decade?
[0:34:49] <+BubbaRands> Everyone be mean to Pat!
[0:34:59] <$AlteissenPrime> Can we just stuff Pat's coffee mug in his festering blowhole?
[0:35:10] <shinygiraffejesus> why be mean to pat
[0:35:19] <sidthegato> Lets all be mean to this Pat guy
[0:35:22] <shinygiraffejesus> wut did pat do
[0:35:30] <mike2hands> that nurse deserves heavem
[0:35:31] <claydog1831> This skeleton is smexy
[0:35:32] <$AlteissenPrime> Because @PlagueOfGripes ordered us to
[0:35:34] <mike2hands> heaven"
[0:35:38] <sir_deadlock> So apparently it's an uncharacteristic increase in price 10-15% suddenly, probably during a disaster, but the specifics vary from state to state.
[0:35:45] <+BubbaRands> What DIDNT Pat do...
[0:35:46] <shinygiraffejesus> oh
[0:35:46] <+Blankplode> Pat did nothing wrong PepeHands

[0:37:25] <%iamnotjex> what
[0:37:30] <toxic_waltzz> Whoah that sounds tough
[0:38:03] <melluster> why does it say "this reward is temporarily out of stock" yet other viewers can redeem it?

[0:39:45] <melluster> i additionally waited for 5 min and it still gave me the same message, and then other plaeer redeemed the glyph reward
[0:39:55] <melluster> kinda, because he didn't include his IGN and platform
[0:40:01] <+BubbaRands> Sounds like heaven tbh Kappa

[0:42:10] <dots4eyes> Has Woolie heard this story yet?
[0:42:11] <melluster> are there any special conditions to redeeming a glyph? like being a subscriber or somthing
[0:42:16] <theloganbrand> Picked a bad time to eat lunch

[0:42:25] <SirGO0SE> did you have that foam shower stuff Paige?
[0:42:27] <@MGlBlaze> God, this all sounds really harrowing
[0:42:27] <%ThePabe> "Pat has left the chat"
[0:42:41] <scrublord009> PISS BACK IS A WEAK POINT
[0:42:43] <+BubbaRands> The piss sack took damage!

[0:43:50] <+BubbaRands> Yeah that’s fucked tbh
[0:43:51] <MachetePhD> So I showed up to the stream like half-way through the conversation. Why was Paige in hospital, if she's mentioned?
[0:43:53] <toxic_waltzz> They're exposing you to an infection my god
[0:43:54] <+pectusumbra> Good to know that hospitals are shitty everywhere you go
[0:43:54] <@MGlBlaze> quiettUwot
[0:43:59] <%ThePabe> wait so, pee is stored in the bed?
[0:44:07] <Kutakai666> wow, that's really bad service from them.
[0:44:09] <%SpotPot> What the fuck.
[0:44:17] <@MGlBlaze> Hearing this story gives me a mix of very strong emotions and none of them are good.
[0:44:39] <$AlteissenPrime> Oh they put you in a MedSurg unit
[0:44:47] <+cyborgoctopus> parisian guys piss in the streets so >_>

[0:45:22] <$Firemane1279> I think it's different between private and public caregivers? At least my perspective anyways.
[0:45:26] <toxic_waltzz> You make it sound like pat is sick "Drink your medicine ffs"
[0:45:26] <dots4eyes> Pat sounds so dead

[0:59:30] <Garthunox> Did you guys hear about Alex Trebek?
[0:59:30] <CalderGaming> Get her out of there, tabarnak
[0:59:36] <@Rozalyndis> we did
[0:59:51] <+Vashiel> I live in Montreal. It's probably a hellzone right now in hospitals given that Montreal is literally the worst zone for Covid in the whole province. The language barrier probably made even worse. Doesn't excuse any of it though
[0:59:52] <Garthunox> ok, just found out and kinda shook
[0:59:57] <+Kevaster135> also most french people here are scummy against english
[0:59:58] <%Goteafish> What hospital was this?

[1:00:38] <Kutakai666> yup.
[1:00:45] <AncelDeLambert> I don't think this is an issue of free healthcare, I think this is an issue of subtle Quebecoi xenophobia
[1:00:50] <scrublord009> @Firemane1279 JOJOLION LET'S GOOOOO PogChamp
[1:00:56] <CamLewis> May not be free, but you don't go bankrupt the moment you get hit by a car.

[1:01:05] <%Goteafish> @AncelDeLambert 100%
[1:01:06] <sir_deadlock> There's also the argument to make that even bad coverage is better than none.
[1:01:16] <%Goteafish> Toronto hospital arent that bad
[1:01:22] <Archangel735> @anceldelambert definitely has to be
[1:01:35] <S33KER> No matter where you are, everyone complains about their healthcare anyway
[1:01:57] <+cyborgoctopus> canada's free healthcare is shit and americans need to stop comparing the idea of free healthcare to canada's bs

[1:02:46] <%spongeofmystery> American healthcare is barbaric
[1:02:58] <+superc37> i think
[1:02:59] <SpookyBeef7> The ambulance ride alone can bankrupt a low income family.
[1:03:02] <+A_Wet_Potato> How many people in chat have that personal experience of literally saying to someone 'don't call an ambulance" *raises hand*
[1:03:03] <WaterDragon68> I fell and broke my elbow last month and I'm still waiting on that bill to come in but hooooo boy
[1:03:05] <$AlteissenPrime> There's also a charge in American healthcare where you're charged $150 to hold your newborn baby after birth.
[1:03:05] <claydog1831> $5000 in California
[1:03:05] <Archangel735> das capitalism babyyyyy
[1:03:11] <@MGlBlaze> American healthcare is "If you get sick, you're going bankrupt"
[1:03:11] <%Razputin217> Oh you’re American? That’ll be $300,000
[1:03:13] <basspanik> Sandals or Jordans guy's
[1:03:18] <sir_deadlock> Is that blueberry and cherry cheesecake? That's pretty.

[1:05:26] <+Sagivaleon> I've sneezed and hit my head so hard on a rounded surface that it split skin and blood was running down my face
[1:05:28] <S33KER> Even if you go full private healthcare in EU it's still cheaper than US healthcare. It's honestly baffling to me why people didn't rebel against that system yet.
[1:05:30] <%AzureZebraKZ> But THe ANTI COUGH DROP THING

[1:09:19] <+mckraven> you'll get weird looks for sure but they probably won't yell at you
[1:09:21] <+Vashiel> In the province of Quebec, you pretty much only have Montreal where you'll "easily" find english-speaking people. The rest of the province is mostly french and they don't "hate" but there's always been tensions
[1:09:21] <%darklord_kris> nah, but the problem is that the agressive seperatist are very loud
[1:09:22] <arthur33344> super scary skeletons LUL

[1:10:18] <AncelDeLambert> IT'S NOT ANYTHING
[1:10:20] <chell_cake> after everything I've heard, that says a lot why (a couple of years ago) canada was asking for brazilians nurses/medics
[1:10:20] <hellfighter666> Latin x is that a music group
[1:10:23] <toxic_waltzz> What the hell

[1:10:27] <%AzureZebraKZ> Sounds like a Yugioh Summon
[1:10:31] <%spongeofmystery> Latin X sounds like ecclesiastic power metal
[1:10:32] <dots4eyes> Don't let Woolie know about a robotic upgrade or he'll betray the human race for this language jetpack

[1:12:09] <toxic_waltzz> There is literally no way to use neutral in spanish, the language itself is based on two genders
[1:12:12] <Garthunox> Roz its worse than being next to England, part of Ireland still belongs to England!

[1:31:12] <@MGlBlaze> I actually agree with pat here.
[1:31:16] <+Jamijji> the family you make is more important than the one you're born with
[1:31:17] <Archangel735> Kevin had a much better family
[1:31:20] <+BubbaRands> But what if the family I marry into sucks?
[1:31:22] <+A_Wet_Potato> that's what I'm doin. I'm marrying into the best family I've ever met with the most amazing person I could ask for
[1:31:22] <%AzureZebraKZ> Annnnnd it's gone :V

[1:31:58] <%AzureZebraKZ> Why does sht not have a custom shy fidget spinner yet
[1:31:59] <%norgthefish> They are Smart enough to earn such amount of money but they always forgot about their own flesh and blood
[1:32:01] <mike2hands> because they're rich assholes

[1:32:03] <%AzureZebraKZ> shy*
[1:32:03] <kaixxc> oh hello there
[1:32:07] <+goose_attack_almanac> Remember. Kevin Mcallisters parents got divorced after Home Alone 2

[1:32:28] <%AzureZebraKZ> @Nimnitz That's Healthy, No cap
[1:32:40] <Sinedos> ммм
[1:32:41] <%ThePabe> don't forget, in one of the later movies, they just replaced Kevin. that family was evil
[1:32:47] <Archangel735> oh thats sick the fidget spinner is right on top of the finger
[1:32:51] <the_Graboid> You fought all the time in school!
[1:32:53] <dots4eyes> Boy van LUL
[1:33:00] <MachetePhD> This whole topic reminded of the fact that people always say "Blood's thicker than water." To be like "oh family is more important." But that's not even the full quote. I think it actually comes from "The blood of the covenant is thicker than the water of the womb." which I think actually means that the relationships you make yourself are stronger than those by birth. ?
[1:33:04] <mike2hands> BOIVIN
[1:33:05] <scrublord009> THE FARGO ACCENT
[1:33:15] <mike2hands> so always?
[1:33:19] <+chiazam> Pat was a Perfect Child TM for like 10 years I SWEAR
[1:33:19] <@MGlBlaze> There is one part of the movie that is subtle but I actually like the touch. When Kevin is remembering the things his family said to him before when he's saying "I made my family disappear", the deliveries he remembers are actually more harsh than they actually were at the time.
[1:33:28] <lazerscraper> do you know the AURA of the MIDDLE NAME
[1:33:30] <+Kevaster135> Boivin?
[1:33:30] <Archangel735> @machetephd yea thats the real quote and meaning
[1:33:40] <+Kevaster135> i know some boivin
[1:33:42] <Archangel735> the comrades you fight with are stronger than family
[1:33:46] <%ThePabe> can't believe Pat blackmailed his mom like that
[1:33:46] <Tampaoster> Paige is pats mother? she wasnt just his sister?
[1:34:00] <@MGlBlaze> Like, the uncle just shouts out "Look what you did you little jerk!" but he remembers it "Look what you DID. You little JERK." with much more venom
[1:34:12] <+StefanUltr4> spin

[1:34:42] <@MGlBlaze> @Archangel735 The "blood is thicker than water" phrase gets flipped back and forth for whatever point the speaker is trying to make.

[1:49:12] <televisedrevolting> If it's green, you ate a sugar cereal.
[1:49:14] <LorcaNomad> It it's white you might be about to die
[1:49:18] <%AzureZebraKZ> WHITE?????
[1:49:19] <%weissguard> For Future Reference: Overly Sarcastic Productions has a video on the History of Wales.
[1:49:19] <toxic_waltzz> green is prolly you're under antibiotics
[1:49:20] <Archangel735> radiation???
[1:49:25] <%PlagueOfGripes> or tons of... bile? I think

[1:49:53] <Tampaoster> isnt bile yellowish?
[1:49:54] <fuji_92> yellow/yellowish white is bile or too much fat in your poo
[1:49:56] <Archangel735> NO
[1:49:56] <Agami23> it will ask you if you dropped a golden shit or a silver shit
