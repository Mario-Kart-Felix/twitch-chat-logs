[0:17:49] <%lewdskeletor13> Are you ok to stream?
[0:17:49] <$RubberFistFight> @Dakuu75 nah they prescribe aspirin because it's got anticoagulant properties - arterial dissection is a problem where the inner wall of your artery breaks down, causing it to kind of "bubble", which leads to clotting and occlusion. The aspirin takes care of the clotting problem.
[0:17:51] <marvel877> You went to Fargo?

[0:33:56] <Analogflame> PATS WEAK
[0:33:56] <+crimsonharvest> sounds like a normal dander allergy
[0:33:58] <derekwst3> @PeachSaliva Pat is just jealous that elmo can grow hair
[0:33:58] <%ThePuddingDead> dander is closer to the skin where the fur grows
[0:33:58] <+AngriestAngryArtist> that is weird as hell. so pat is allergic to the skin residue D:
[0:33:58] <laserbeaming> Probably the dander
[0:33:58] <%arcaderabbit48> Because Pat isnt allergic to the fut, he is allergic to the dander and dead skin cells Elmo flakes off like a mound of snow
[0:33:59] <+Flambage> @PeachSaliva Even Elmo's hair rejects Pat!
[0:34:01] <ScreamLord> Pat is some kind of Bizarro human
[0:34:04] <Trash_leviathan> @PeachSaliva i made a meme
[0:34:04] <%ChaosAethr> Is Elmo an SCP?
[0:34:07] <$RubberFistFight> @PeachSaliva That's because the thing that causes allergic reaction is the dander, not the hair. Cat saliva has an enzyme that is responsible for deodorising them - that's what sets off allergic folk.
[0:34:07] <ivansonic08> Pat why couldn't you have choseen better genes?
[0:34:08] <CrabSlacks> the hair acts as a heat sink for Elmos intense power
[0:34:08] <misterspotswood> skin makes allergies more than hair

[0:34:27] <%GeneralSCPatton> @el_phthalo PETA is against the entire concept of pets. They have literally been caught abducting pets off of porches and euthanizing them in a van.
[0:34:32] <+KabaBoBaba> my husband wanted our dog to sleep in bed with us once we bought our hose. I gave in finally and nearly died. He knows more so now why i don't like sleeping with pets

[0:35:02] <$RubberFistFight> Hypoallergenic cats only have shorter fur by coincidence - they're bred to have lower levels of the deodorising enzyme in their spit.

[1:19:49] <SunnyD_Solaire> drop your menu
[1:19:50] <%Mendin> ATTENTION ALL WANNABE INVADERS: DS2 Matchmaking for the red eye orb is same-SM-Tier or higher, so if your SM is more than... 50-60k, you're well past her still and will not invade her
[1:19:51] <VestigeOuroboros> Did they ever fix the complete tracking overheads on smelter or is it still bad in this game
[1:19:51] <%RafflesiaA> Pat how could she remember anything she's been in the hospital AND the sun is down
[1:19:55] <TwinBat> drop your menu woolie
[1:19:55] <haisho> if Paige gonna be a Woolie and get ALL the drops?

[1:22:41] <%Sphincter_Spelunker> Why did you tell her R2 exists
[1:22:46] <+badchoice5> @PeachSaliva You can just hug the shield guys bodies and walk left around them safely, it dodges the whole combo
[1:22:46] <%RafflesiaA> Those were indeed all fine
[1:22:48] <+arancet> the hypest hopsital gameplay on twitch

[1:23:33] <SixthSun2> Classic
[1:23:34] <Guntanks_in_Space> there's the wide swings
[1:23:34] <%skm742> it's probably easier and safer to try to fight them in the arena
[1:23:37] <+badchoice5> IMPOSSIBLE
[1:23:37] <Fujiwara_92> NEVER
[1:23:37] <tigerfang86> HOW can this BE
[1:23:37] <befreakinhappy> 33
[1:23:38] <coke_monster> First dodge was on point.
[1:23:39] <Brother_Coduss> how can this BE
[1:23:41] <SuspiciousEd> making things harder pulling him out. other two dont attack til he dies
[1:23:42] <EuropanLamprey> No it didn't

[1:23:48] <+gralho> SoonerLater
[1:23:49] <DrozZombie> so dodge opposite of how the swing. so front to back you dodge side to side
[1:23:49] <veldinmusic> No im offline too
[1:23:49] <%MaximumDaximum> Paige, if you fight the sword guy in the middle the other two won't attack you until he's dead

[1:26:21] <+Danofthetubes> Try blunt weapon tbh
[1:26:23] <+Urgoslav> You need a bigger sword and more muscles
[1:26:25] <+Danofthetubes> Use mace

[1:26:47] <%arcaderabbit48> This si the area where you are forced to learn to time your dodge rolls, because of the specific arcs the enemies use. Now, let's watch Paige not learn that lesson
[1:26:47] <$i_am_therydon> enemies will despawn as long as paige kills.
[1:26:48] <DrozZombie> use your mace there head to toe in plate

[1:35:21] <Shion963> literally the first fight after bonfire
[1:35:22] <tigerfang86> SUN IS SO DOWN
[1:35:23] <+XxBTExX> If youa re a good player, Lifegems are the way to go.
[1:35:23] <OwlLightningMage> That's what you told her to do
[1:35:25] <Louie_Salmon> Using lifegems works if you don't die every 10 seconds
[1:35:28] <+Hoisengineer> it's like free money

[1:35:39] <VJdarkworld> lifegems are for during combat
[1:35:41] <ShichiNoBushi> Estus is effectively limitless in the long-term while you have to find or buy Life Gems.
[1:35:42] <%linSP> shes SMART
[1:35:42] <Run44forrest> pat and paige block your way. one only tells lies and the other one forgets
[1:35:42] <%RafflesiaA> @WhackyChiraqi Shields are big but they are not strong so they are not Peach-certified

[1:37:10] <Coystick> You know everyone bitched when Dark2 added the eventual permanent despawn to enemies after you kill them enough, but that mechanic might actually SAVE Paige.
[1:37:11] <garbageheaphound> thatys actually different

[2:07:10] <+badchoice5> @PeachSaliva As someone who went deathless through this game, please use a small fast one hander and shield. It will HELP
[2:07:10] <+RevolverOcelot16> LUL

[2:07:18] <%QueequegTheater> CANT WAKE UP
[2:07:18] <ShichiNoBushi> I think it being too big would make it more prone to getting stuck (if fitting in in the first place).

[2:07:41] <$RubberFistFight> @tigerfang86 DS2 is nothing like bloodborne, not even remotely, besides being a fromsoft title
[2:07:42] <$shurtal> "put it in my mouth"

[2:31:12] <%Keyd00d> the lie ring
[2:31:13] <Gruhunchously> Will NOT make you human again
[2:31:13] <$RubberFistFight> @QueequegTheater Sekiro's problem is the engine's fucking shitty atrocious frame pacing issues and its inability to hold a stable 60fps unless you have an obscenely overpowered PC. The base PS4 version is unplayable if you've played it on PC - it straight up eats inputs in high-intensity fights due to aforementioned frame pacing/timing issues.
[2:31:15] <CheekyBirb> replace life

[2:31:24] <Zamorouskiwhich> Life is only 3% HP isn't it?
[2:31:24] <%arcaderabbit48> This is another one fo those Rings that are so good, it effectively limits your Ring count by 1. Because you will never want to take it off
[2:31:30] <Djinnazz> get rid of the life ring.\

[2:41:20] <+badchoice5> @PeachSaliva Just know, this game is built for shields, they are stupid good
[2:41:21] <Shion963> Fire Longsword should still be fine right
[2:41:24] <SulfurousAcid> where claymore?
[2:41:26] <Zeddsworth> If you want bigger weapons you must grow bigger balls
[2:41:26] <rumin56> Menu is the biggest enemy so far
[2:41:27] <%bevyrage> halberd is your biggest weapon
[2:41:30] <el_phthalo> Shoutout to Devotee Scarlet.

[2:41:33] <DesuDesuDokiDoki> dab
[2:41:34] <%bevyrage> is also super good against armor
[2:41:34] <Hydrapissed> SKA doosh
[2:41:35] <srkAres> too late girl
[2:41:35] <+Order_of_Mystery> the mace is great, who dares dunk on it?
[2:41:37] <TsunTsuchinoko> halberd doesn't have the best moveset in 2
[2:41:37] <%Gray_skies1993> ALWAYS THE 3RD ONE
[2:41:37] <+Sighden> How has she not learned the pimp hand roll by now D:
[2:41:37] <%Roasted_Pheasant> new wepon?
[2:41:38] <%arcaderabbit48> The halberd would be bad for her because it rewards precision with its hitboxes. She will miss all the time and be left wide open
[2:41:38] <Niney_Who> I think she needs the mace to reinforce her range
[2:41:39] <tacostarvedbeast> paige strikes me as a dagger girl
[2:41:39] <VERDAXY> BIG BALLS
[2:41:40] <%Mister_McDerp> Halberd is best weapon
[2:41:41] <DracaenaLeaf> not as bad as before don't worry
[2:41:42] <Jack_of_No_Trades> run through fog?
[2:41:43] <captwolfaroo> It's almost like blocking would help
[2:41:47] <oneterriblemistake> paige you could try just running to the fog door

[2:59:31] <el_phthalo> This is unironically one of my favorite bosses to fight once I learned his move set.
[2:59:33] <Dante_the_spooks_man> Solid attempt
[2:59:34] <+badchoice5> Pursuer is Big, Paige is Smol

[3:00:20] <+Kataguro> They were also really cool
[3:00:21] <%Ninestempest> also he is
[3:00:22] <%Ninestempest> not optional
[3:00:23] <%QueequegTheater> YOU BEAT ORPHAN
[3:00:23] <Fujiwara_92> NOTHING IS OPTIONAL
[3:00:24] <Run44forrest> dont get greedy and wait your turn to heal ant attack
[3:00:24] <%king_wragles> @PeachSaliva doesn't he drop a good sword?
[3:00:25] <%Ninestempest> not really
[3:00:25] <%Mister_McDerp> because pursuer is too cool to skip
[3:00:28] <sheevabestwaifu> She's not gonna do well in dark souls 3 because of the 3
[3:00:29] <Shion963> Drangleic Sword go

[3:00:33] <Debabruce> Don‚Äôt give up skeleton
[3:00:34] <%legendfather_of_giants> @PeachSaliva you can get there via firebombs
[3:00:35] <%Sphincter_Spelunker> Kill him for his sword
[3:00:35] <DrozZombie> thios sucks but play lame
[3:00:36] <Hydrapissed> because pursuer is a lame ass hole
[3:00:36] <+Blargimazombie> you're streaming it nothing is optional
[3:00:42] <EuropanLamprey> You need to beat him for Dull Ember
[3:00:44] <possumwalsh1221> I COULDNT EVEN BEAT ORPHAN
[3:00:44] <%Sasquatch_John> And you better get used to fighting him
[3:00:48] <VestigeOuroboros> "he unlocks areas you can't get to otherwise" Also known as Not optional.
[3:00:49] <DesuDesuDokiDoki> dee ell sea
[3:00:50] <rumin56> orphan is way harder kik
[3:00:52] <Cirnosonic> and one of the hardest ever!
[3:00:52] <%skm742> he is optional, he forms a weird triangle of 3 bosses, one can be optional
[3:00:54] <+Tyonidus> PAIGE BEAT ORPHAN IN LESS ATTEMPTS THAN IT TOOK ME
[3:00:54] <%The_Introspector> Orphan is harder than anything in this game
[3:00:55] <+AtlasMcCoy> Life experience is non-optional
[3:00:55] <%deviljhojho94> Orphan was asking for it
[3:00:56] <+badchoice5> Pursuer is not an Orphan, he is Big
[3:00:59] <Fujiwara_92> I STILL HAVE TO BEAT LUDWIG
[3:00:59] <rumin56> nothing is optional
[3:00:59] <weissguard> There's another way to get to that aforementioned area.
[3:01:00] <Dakuu75> she beat "orphan"? you mean Orphan of Koss?
[3:01:01] <%JenovasPuppet> Very true
[3:01:03] <Hydrapissed> also orphan is a parry bait boss how the fuck can people not beat it
[3:01:05] <Birdigalore> Orphan, arguably the most difficult boss in souls
[3:01:06] <+cbreezy122112> Dodge Duck Dip Dive and Dodge
[3:01:08] <%GabeSweetMan> Paige sure did abort that orphan.
[3:01:09] <thomassolorio> come on dude you got this biznach

[3:04:50] <TwinBat> Pat talked and it all went downhill
[3:04:50] <%Gray_skies1993> @PeachSaliva you did much better that time around, I think you could do it in maybe another 1-3 attempts
[3:04:50] <tigerfang86> [CRAZY TALK] HAS CHANGED THE TRUTH

[3:05:01] <Jack_of_No_Trades> traditional germanic legginbaul svet
[3:05:02] <%The_Introspector> If she uses the ballista she could get it.
[3:05:02] <fiiive> do u not wanna use the crossbow thing? am i allow to say that :/
[3:05:03] <asthanius> Paige is doing better life-wise than Pat and his ball-phone
[3:05:05] <+Blargimazombie> DOING GOOD
[3:05:05] <DrozZombie> Paige is in a bad mood
[3:05:06] <DesuDesuDokiDoki> the s c e n t
[3:05:06] <NicLoson> That was a good run tho
[3:05:09] <Gruhunchously> Ball sweat is not to be taking lightly
[3:05:11] <rumin56> Pat: Those are improvements CRAZYTALK: They won't be for long
[3:05:11] <RupanSen> gamer ballsweat
[3:05:13] <+SamleyTimes> unironically pretty good
[3:05:13] <Smaenus> She scream at own ass
[3:05:15] <+Tyonidus> Paige, you really shouldn't expect to beat these bosses on your first few tries.
[3:05:16] <DeathByPoke7> leggin ball sweat is the worst kind
[3:05:16] <+Tyonidus> NO
[3:05:17] <buerdo> Pursuer does more damage after curse stab
[3:05:17] <VestigeOuroboros> Reset the counter for days without pat talking about his ballsweat on stream
[3:05:18] <parkslady> I would be aw
[3:05:18] <tigerfang86> eh
[3:05:19] <possumwalsh1221> What if I did it tho
[3:05:19] <sheevabestwaifu> Pat balls were hot
[3:05:20] <Hydrapissed> nah not really
[3:05:21] <%panic_rabbit> wait, there are people who don't do that?
[3:05:21] <Shion963> playing dark souls gets you a lot of those screams

[3:05:30] <%legendfather_of_giants> @PeachSaliva I do way worse than that against Pursuer
[3:05:30] <possumwalsh1221> You almost killed him Paige
[3:05:30] <%Mendin> Peach you could reload again if you want human help
[3:05:30] <%Gray_skies1993> @PeachSaliva Paige, you did much better that time around, I think you could do it in maybe another 1-3 attempts
[3:05:31] <Gruhunchously> Gamer girl ballsweat
[3:05:31] <+luftraumm1> toy did a good thing
[3:05:32] <%CaptainKarite> Youre great!!
[3:05:33] <+badchoice5> I would be honored to be executed by the Pursuer's Bigness
[3:05:33] <tacostarvedbeast> @PeachSaliva im watching a great stream, im in a great mood!
[3:05:35] <%ssjklyco> I say stop now, the beat him at the start of the next stream just like in Bloodborne.
[3:05:35] <%ElenaManetta> hell no, when i fail at a video game i have to turn it off and stew. when you're mad at a video game, you can look at chat and go HA HA CHAT

[3:05:47] <%The_Introspector> Next try use ballista and it's a win.
[3:05:47] <Bloodninja15> Parry Pursuer like a god
[3:05:47] <tigerfang86> TRUE
[3:05:48] <sheevabestwaifu> Remember the 3
[3:05:49] <$connos_procrastination> just like gohan
[3:05:50] <parkslady> dad's right
[3:05:51] <Luesagna00> @peachsaliva you need to talk more during those moments. Literately tongue movement calms your lizard brain
[3:05:53] <DeathByPoke7> you gotta believe in the parry
[3:05:53] <ShichiNoBushi> So by the math, only 2 more attempts.
[3:05:53] <+luftraumm1> remember these games are a marathon not a sprint
[3:05:54] <+SamleyTimes> balls to the grindstone
[3:05:54] <rumin56> SeemsGood

[3:15:21] <%king_wragles> that... that's just moving
[3:15:22] <zamzoph> @PeachSaliva I found out a couple of days ago that I have a rare eye disease called Krotoconus and now I gotta get an eye procedure and my eye getting messed with really scares me BibleThump

[3:15:27] <+KillScottKill> LUL
[3:15:27] <+badchoice5> The inputs come out as quickly as Paige read them, cause of the lag
[3:15:31] <DesuDesuDokiDoki> its a movement combo
[3:15:32] <rumin56> Footsies pat
[3:15:32] <IntrepidEye> sounds like a fucking PS1 cheat code
[3:15:34] <+BomaZero> @PeachSaliva The latency hasn't caught up for the button at the end
[3:15:34] <calebhardman21> non gamers trying to game
[3:15:34] <+neojadan> Ah, the step backwards and crouch rapidly combo.
[3:15:36] <CherrieVelvet> maybe that is the combo
[3:15:36] <%ElenaManetta> this is the nerdiest joke on stream to date
[3:15:37] <$MapleLeafTengu> #PRAYFORDEATH
[3:15:37] <%XxBTExX> The real button is the friends we made along the way.
[3:15:38] <+SamleyTimes> stadia do new kombo
[3:15:38] <Nina96> is that gonna be on the podcast?
[3:15:38] <Run44forrest> thats FOOTSIES pat
[3:15:38] <TheArrow_> it could be a fatality
[3:15:39] <+Kataguro> Thanks, Google. You didn't use yourself to look up a command
[3:15:41] <artificiallynatural> stadia cheat codes
[3:15:41] <%ElenaManetta> you guys are fucking nerds
[3:15:43] <rumin56> FOOTSIES
[3:15:45] <eanscrale> This isn't tekken
[3:15:45] <Gruhunchously> That sounds like something out of a David Cage game
[3:15:46] <hntronium> fake samsho
[3:15:47] <sheevabestwaifu> ^<<>^>@.[@<
[3:15:49] <Fujiwara_92> FORTIES PAT
[3:15:51] <Paperware> That makes the pretzel sound reasonable
[3:15:52] <SGrim> @PeachSaliva tell Pat that in Monster Hunter 1, that's constitutes a full hammer combo. LuL
[3:15:53] <+HelveticaScenario> Grandma is in charge of the Stadia account
[3:15:53] <Hydrapissed> ab ab start
[3:15:54] <Debabruce> Also samurai shodown has little to no combos
[3:15:54] <MrDonTacos_> also combos in shodown LUL
[3:15:56] <Dakuu75> *face palms*
[3:15:56] <+Kataguro> It was also wrong
[3:15:57] <DeathByPoke7> move back tea bag jump and teabag again
[3:16:00] <Fujiwara_92> FOOTSIES PAT
[3:16:01] <worldbrand> almost the konami code
[3:16:03] <King_Wolf_Rigger> It's a secret move for Ryu's special in 3rd strike
[3:16:07] <absolute_cagemony> I mean that could be someone moving around in Teken...
[3:16:09] <%linSP> thats just mashing the stick randomly
[3:16:10] <+skylerpilot> @PeachSaliva Thats a command grab buffer into empty jump in SF4 Pat!
[3:16:10] <Luesagna00> @peachsaliva its doable when u use the directional pad
[3:16:12] <raven_frame> It‚Äôs an input with no actual button to initiate the move.
[3:16:13] <$Agami23> @PeachSaliva hey paige, a character in my game has a skill that makes them way stronger between 3pm to 9pm but weak all other times. is that what your problem is?
[3:16:13] <majindusto> FUCK SPAWN NOT COMING OUT UNTIL NEXT YEAR!!! BibleThump
[3:16:14] <Louie_Salmon> You could have literally googled ANY combo. On google
[3:16:15] <%RedMageRebel> fighting games hurt my head trying to read KOMBO
[3:16:17] <$PanDOTexe> even so how do you fail to put the konami code
[3:16:17] <%RafflesiaA> Corporate doesn't either
[3:16:18] <%ElenaManetta> you're just some corporate streamer
[3:16:18] <Roz_Lynd> i recognize failure marketing ploys
[3:16:18] <DesuDesuDokiDoki> ?
[3:16:18] <LifesNeverHumDrum> how ironic that google didnt look up the konami code
[3:16:19] <%Pakooboomi> crowd control
[3:16:19] <tacostarvedbeast> They are play footsies and spacing obviously
[3:16:23] <+Kataguro> It's the lack of a button that kills me
[3:16:25] <%Sphincter_Spelunker> LUL
[3:16:26] <+floralkami> that is cooperate
[3:16:26] <Hydrapissed> ITS A FAKE out
[3:16:29] <sheevabestwaifu> Asshole grab
[3:16:29] <Hydrapissed> its a pump fake
[3:16:29] <absolute_cagemony> move back, side step, move forward, side step left then right
[3:16:30] <Louie_Salmon> They're literally Google! They can literally Google it!
[3:16:32] <%starotter70> It's so stupid
[3:16:33] <ChineseNininga> it could be a movement thing in a 3d fighter
[3:16:37] <kasios> IT'S TRASH
[3:16:38] <+skylerpilot> lol
[3:16:38] <%bevyrage> it's one button off from a fatality input in mortal kombat

[3:16:53] <absolute_cagemony> ITS A MOTION IN TEKKEN YOU FRAUD
[3:16:56] <DesuDesuDokiDoki> its a dance
[3:16:56] <Fujiwara_92> it's nothing
[3:16:56] <%TheShal> Is it a Fatality/Brutality??

[3:17:22] <+floralkami> @rafflesiaa left down down right up down
