[0:05:29] <Mirkososa> hryBoggies
[0:05:54] <%GabeSweetMan> I also love that Mettaton's boss theme has 3 lietmotifs that hints at his relationship with other characters that (unless you grind) you're likely not going to learn until the post-game.
[0:07:06] <%BallerSwagBro9k> BallerSwagBro9k subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 11 months! Isn't Candy just the best character ever?!
[0:07:07] <MyNameIsRasus> Toby Fox continues to be a master at leitmotifs
[0:07:28] <Jetsfantasy> @GabeSweetMan That's become a thing over many characters now, especially with Deltarune. Very fun to dissect as a musician
[0:08:04] <WFN_Art> It also helps a (metta)ton that he uses the same library of sounds and synths across these games

[0:26:45] <MyNameIsRasus> I mean that's what you're kinda supposed to do
[0:26:47] <+BubbaRands> JUST GIVE IT
[0:26:48] <@Jekado> thats the poin
[0:26:49] <locobo98> you're just ment to be there as a witness
[0:26:49] <holyxgrale> You activate bullet time
[0:26:51] <%Ranryu692> yeah, that is what you're trained to do
[0:26:51] <DXLelouch24> "can i have some, im underpaid?"
[0:26:51] <+emperordread> I've worked security, that's literally what they tell you to do
[0:26:52] <churropoppa> nah you're just a glorified snitch
[0:26:54] <locobo98> and call the cops
[0:26:54] <ryderbootz> then youre not a guard pat
[0:26:54] <+MauriceFaurron> that's called a work ethic
[0:26:55] <@Jekado> if you are a guard
[0:26:55] <IceWorldMedia> Just say you tried
[0:26:55] <+Damie904> You just have to prove you made an effort
[0:26:55] <MyNameIsRasus> Implication
[0:26:55] <%cobalt_phoenix_> pretty sure most guards are there against non armed people
[0:26:55] <%g0atmeal> what if you have enough allies to win?
[0:26:56] <@Jekado> report
[0:26:57] <+Dirty_Dandere> Protect the people
[0:26:59] <Shadope342> a guards to stop a random guy or kids

[0:27:04] <@Jekado> Report and observe
[0:27:05] <%zhenthrim213> its for the unarmed dumbasses
[0:27:06] <i_chevalier> deterrence
[0:27:06] <%thejimjamz> If they a punk ass and you punk their ass but if they real shit then you shit real
[0:27:07] <%greasypete00> i think bank security is more for removing rowdy people who are causing problems that dont involve armed robbery
[0:27:09] <locobo98> you have to be there as a witness
[0:27:09] <+LucentHolic> For the problems that don't put your life on the line
[0:27:11] <%GabeSweetMan> Depends on your level of security. If not armed, GIVE UP.
[0:27:11] <+Dakuu75> guard is jsut there to kick the homeless out
[0:27:12] <MaesePC> they company probably blame you and think you are a thief too
[0:27:13] <OldManDeckardCain> so not only would pat be a terrible at his learned job, he would also be terrible as a guard LUL
[0:27:13] <@Jekado> guard duty is more like report duty
[0:27:16] <locobo98> you're not an armed guardian
[0:27:16] <%zhenthrim213> and a witness
[0:27:17] <ExpressNode> It depends if you are an armed guard or a non amred one
[0:27:17] <@MelBrooksKA> @PeachSaliva Take out annoying people
[0:27:19] <+McSoliace> punch the bullets i guess
[0:27:23] <vonmaultke> The law and the guard will not engage but the employer wants direct action. It sucks
[0:27:25] <%Garthunox> banks have insurance, fuck em
[0:27:26] <twistedj3ster> "Do I want to possibly add murder to the following charges?"
[0:27:26] <%TheWinged7> ooh, gl if its the top half
[0:27:27] <%JoshManVGH> Deterrent, and a level of theater for the customers.
[0:27:28] <$KeiganOfAstora> SOLDER
[0:27:28] <$Bt_Robot> Guards keep insurance low
[0:27:32] <$KeiganOfAstora> Pronounced sodder
[0:27:35] <marvel877> SOULDER
[0:27:36] <@Jekado> if you are on a armored car detail then yeah there is some shooting...
[0:27:38] <%cobalt_phoenix_> pat did you grab the hot part
[0:27:39] <holyxgrale> PogChamp
[0:27:42] <%Ranryu692> "accidentally"
[0:27:42] <$KeiganOfAstora> Can Paige use any power tools?
[0:27:43] <%GabeSweetMan> Solder is spelled wrong
[0:27:43] <$SvenHolgersson> I mean whats the common denominator there Patrick
[0:27:59] <$SvenHolgersson> It's like Island
[0:28:00] <%g0atmeal> is it more dangerous than frying stuff?
[0:28:01] <+Dirty_Dandere> Sodder
[0:28:02] <%MechArch> paige with a nail gun
[0:28:04] <+LucentHolic> like Salmon!
[0:28:05] <%TheWinged7> so flamethrower is the top of the list right pat?
[0:28:05] <%zhenthrim213> im litterly told if someone starts clearing sheleves in the gas station just let em
[0:28:07] <MyNameIsRasus> How the fuck is Solder supposed to be pronounced Sodder
[0:28:08] <%GabeSweetMan> THERE'S NO EL!
[0:28:08] <%spongeofmystery> Paige can't even be trusted with a laser rangefinder
[0:28:10] <s1rcuit> it's a detterent, but more importantly it's so there's someone there to document events
[0:28:11] <%GabeSweetMan> It's stupid
[0:28:11] <%cobalt_phoenix_> @MechArch NO
[0:28:12] <%greasypete00> like bow and bough
[0:28:14] <%JoshManVGH> like Lincoln
[0:28:18] <CanadianAnimatorGuy> Would you trust Paige with Cow Tools?
[0:28:18] <%dankjerri> Cheer1000 having to route theough new mexico to get to Denver since Colorado is FUCKED (why am i delivering water from Cali to Colorado), hope you guys are staying warm and staying messy
[0:28:29] <Ipsenscastle> i mean in the uk we literally pronounce it as it's written
[0:28:32] <shotgang86> Paige with a soldering iron running around the pool
[0:28:36] <+McSoliace> silent letters are such bs
[0:28:36] <$NitronStreams> like how Colonel is pronounced Cernel
[0:28:40] <Ipsenscastle> it's just sol-der
[0:28:44] <%MechArch> @cobalt_phoenix_ isn't that a B horror movie?
[0:28:44] <+cubbywolf> who gave her a laser pointer? elmo no doubt
[0:28:48] <@MelBrooksKA> Local woman blinds herself with laser pointer
[0:28:53] <theshillman> which power tool would you trust paige the least with? i vote lathe
[0:28:57] <%thejimjamz> @Ipsenscastle unrelated but i deeply appreciate your namesake, i love that song in ff9
[0:28:58] <CatRidder> nah
[0:28:58] <%Ranryu692> Solder comes from the Old French "soudure"
[0:29:00] <%GabeSweetMan> yeyeye
[0:29:02] <%dankjerri> you shooooould
[0:29:03] <holyxgrale> LUL
[0:29:07] <$KeiganOfAstora> It's gonna take her 6 years
[0:29:07] <@SoFarFetched> yeah thats gonna be WAY too long.
[0:29:10] <%TheWinged7> soooooo, 6 years of paige streams?
[0:29:11] <OldManDeckardCain> gonna bang all of the games by the end of winter Kappa
[0:29:13] <afronooch> 7 or 8 yeah

[0:29:14] <%GabeSweetMan> Well that was also 100%
[0:29:15] <$KeiganOfAstora> Gonna take too long
[0:29:15] <IceWorldMedia> They are big games
[0:29:15] <Ipsenscastle> @thejimjamz aw thanks! I appreciate you saying so :)
[0:29:20] <jacobknight13> it would take 5 years for you

I’d love to see you, Pat  Elmo and gaseous Zangief know that I know who you guys are!! So upset!! Also are you a fan of the bioshock games?
[0:29:20] <$KeiganOfAstora> And you don't so it'll be longer

[0:29:22] <DancesWitBalrog> enviWobble enviWobble enviWobble enviWobble enviWobble hi guys
[0:29:26] <%spongeofmystery> There's an L in solder in proper countries. It's just America and apparently Canada where you don't say it

[0:29:30] <DXLelouch24> just stop being a coward
[0:29:30] <%thejimjamz> But baba

[0:29:32] <Coystick> Babaaaaaa
[0:29:34] <DXLelouch24> simplw
[0:29:38] <+emperordread> I think GRRM will finish the Game of Thrones books before Paige would finish ME
[0:29:38] <@SoFarFetched> @KeiganOfAstora yeah she finished months ago
[0:29:43] <$KeiganOfAstora> Did she finish the DLC tho?
[0:29:43] <%GabeSweetMan> Do your dragon and bird man sidequests and skip everyone else.
[0:29:44] <IceWorldMedia> Just do bloodborne again
[0:29:46] <%zhenthrim213> the squint
[0:29:47] <%g0atmeal> you could totally beat ds3 dlc before elden ring comes out
[0:29:47] <$KeiganOfAstora> I don't remember her beating Gael or Midir
[0:29:51] <$SvenHolgersson> Beat Pat live on stream

[0:30:58] <%hewlettfan96> Big muppet mouth
[0:30:59] <Shaaark25> Thank you for birthday!
[0:30:59] <@SoFarFetched> @KeiganOfAstora And well technically you asked if she finished Dark Souls 3, she DID get the ending to Dark Souls 3. So it would count as finishing.
[0:31:00] <%g0atmeal> geck
[0:31:06] <%dankjerri> he likes to taste the pH level in the air
[0:31:06] <OldManDeckardCain> I would be pretty pissed if I was a gecko tbh
[0:31:16] <$shurtal> zangief is a yahg
[0:31:20] <$KeiganOfAstora> So DLC isn't part of the game?
[0:31:22] <Xenioplate> Don't mess with Gex
[0:31:23] <+Dakuu75> like an SCP
[0:31:29] <$KeiganOfAstora> I get your train of thought, just disagree
[0:31:29] <nomolomo> i cant believe paige and pat donated their DNA and got a dog that looks exactly like them out of it. science truly is amazing
[0:31:31] <%dankjerri> no
[0:31:32] <+CTMathiu> i love dark crystal
[0:31:33] <$SvenHolgersson> Wait I thought that was in Labyrinth too
[0:31:35] <%g0atmeal> that gecko looks just like PogChamp
[0:31:42] <%dankjerri> tums
[0:31:47] <%spongeofmystery> I want one of those geckos now
[0:31:48] <%hewlettfan96> KomodoHype KomodoHype KomodoHype
[0:31:50] <@SoFarFetched> @KeiganOfAstora I mean she never did the DS2 DLC so does that mean she never finished DS2?
[0:31:57] <$KeiganOfAstora> Yes?
[0:32:02] <%weapon000> She admitted it.  Zangeif is a muppet.  I knew it.
[0:32:06] <SulfurousAcid> KomodoHype PogChamp KomodoHype
[0:32:07] <%GabeSweetMan> That's.. probably fair.
[0:32:09] <$Bt_Robot> Wait, Tokay geckos are real? I thought they were just a race from Oracle of Ages
[0:32:12] <hearingthenseeing> wow thanks twitch for no notification! love it
[0:32:14] <Monkeyweed21> Little hope is by far the worst of these
[0:32:14] <+Ynkubus_> still mad at netflix for not renewing the dark crystal series
[0:32:15] <%dankjerri> eh

[0:32:20] <$KeiganOfAstora> She beat all of Dark Souls 1
[0:32:21] <IceWorldMedia> Eh not really
[0:32:23] <VritraReiRei> what about compared to Man of Medan? 🤔
[0:32:23] <Lancaster_H> i mean man of medan was also pretty shit
[0:32:24] <+ZephynM> I kind of want to play this game so I can watch all the characters die horribly.
[0:32:25] <DXLelouch24> how does the Pandemic force someone to make a bad story?!
[0:32:25] <MaesePC> @PeachSaliva didn't you see the eye doctor? i notice you are squinting your eyes to read
[0:32:26] <%GabeSweetMan> Maybe??

[0:36:56] <%cobalt_phoenix_> wait what happened
[0:37:00] <heartlesshealer> bang*
[0:37:02] <pennykettle_> That guy is doing a grande water heist
[0:37:04] <%SovPho> California has a shitton of water, it's just all privatized.
[0:37:05] <@SoFarFetched> Its why California is in a drought
[0:37:06] <%zhenthrim213> @Reanimator83 the new one almost gets to until dawn lvls
[0:37:06] <+ZephynM> California has water. Sometimes.
[0:37:07] <shotgang86> yes
[0:37:08] <%Sotetsu> Give us your water!
[0:37:10] <@SoFarFetched> companies want our water
[0:37:10] <CappuccinoGuil> It's the Great Water Heist
[0:37:12] <PlaidisTheNewPlaid> We gotta steal all the water from California
[0:37:18] <%ElkRiverDog> Capatalism!
[0:37:19] <+RenoDeGeneric> California like exclusively steals water for Colorado
[0:37:20] <$KeiganOfAstora> Is California still on fire?
[0:37:25] <+emperordread> Like season 2 iirc
[0:37:31] <shotgang86> when is california NOT on fire?
[0:37:33] <Pappajimbo> Delicious sea water
[0:37:35] <%cobalt_phoenix_> @KeiganOfAstora it always is
[0:37:38] <Monkeyweed21> @KeiganOfAstora we're finally getting rain this year
[0:37:39] <$KeiganOfAstora> Yea....
[0:37:40] <SulfurousAcid> I thought cali was always on fire
[0:37:40] <%JoshManVGH> California water is controlled by a few companies, so capitalism
[0:37:44] <%Sotetsu> California borders the ocean, they've got tons of water.
[0:37:46] <+Piemen99> Jake the dog?
[0:37:47] <$KeiganOfAstora> @Monkeyweed21 Stay safe goo dbuddy
[0:37:47] <heartlesshealer> Rich people are stealing our water by paying the exorbitant extra water fees that no one else can afford which are supposed to be a deterrant to avoid drought
[0:37:49] <$chance_h> Why do they call it oven when you of in the cold food and of out hot eat the food? Hmmmmm
[0:37:51] <%Ranryu692> he's better than any of the kids in TNG
[0:37:51] <%dankjerri> @peachsaliva its artisan weird as hell work out water
[0:37:54] <+Rofiarf> Jake is there to let Ben be a good dad
[0:37:55] <BackflipCharm> Jake is a solid child character. I liked him
[0:37:57] <Reanimator83> @zhenthrim213 that's surprising. might have to look it up than
[0:37:58] <BigYanno> He has a couple of good episodes later
[0:37:59] <graemecrackers2> Hey Paige :)
[0:38:15] <BigYanno> but Jake is more of a plot device than an actual character
[0:38:22] <Coystick> Bioshock 2 is bae
[0:38:25] <Monkeyweed21> @KeiganOfAstora we are literally going from wildfire warnings to flood and landslide warnings lol
[0:38:26] <%zhenthrim213> @Reanimator83 its defintley better than Medan
[0:38:28] <pennykettle_> The start of Bioshock Infinite really went for some GASPS
[0:38:36] <%Sotetsu> I liked BioShock 2.
[0:38:37] <%blaccbird914> 2 plays better imo
[0:38:45] <PlaidisTheNewPlaid> Bioshock 2: Bioshock again
[0:38:49] <+cvp5127> LUL
[0:38:49] <Psyramics> Bioshock is better as a game
[0:38:50] <+Dirty_Dandere> NO
[0:38:53] <%JoshManVGH> @heartlesshealer "When the punishment for a crime is a fine, that is a law that only exists for the poor!"
[0:38:55] <Coystick> Bioshock 2 is Bioshock 1 without the twist but with way better gameplay
[0:38:56] <DancesWitBalrog> enviSHAKE ma'am where are your corrective lenses
[0:38:58] <%Ranryu692> Elizabeth was really hot though
[0:38:59] <%dankjerri> im sorry guys, when i started this job i thought I'd be delivering things people needed
[0:39:00] <CappuccinoGuil> Bioshock 2 had a GREAT multiplayer, though
[0:39:01] <$lumporr> they never do
[0:39:01] <pennykettle_> No but you forgot, the black revolutionary was racist too
[0:39:02] <bob900000> probably not
[0:39:02] <%mighty_max_t> Bioshock 2 has a weaker story but better gameplay
[0:39:03] <Lancaster_H> infinite was a david cage game but decent-er
[0:39:04] <+kyh9> Bioshock Infinite was EMBARASSING with how it presented politics
[0:39:08] <Prevot> also mediocre gameplay
[0:39:10] <+cvp5127> elizabeth boobs are really big tho
[0:39:11] <Sunstalker> Bioshock 2 is actually the best of them all. Plus the best dlc
[0:39:11] <IceWorldMedia> It’s so baffling that everyone I know that’s into Star Trek always goes “like 75% of this show sucks I love it”
[0:39:15] <+Sullen_Walrus> bioshock 2 has the best combat by far out of the 3 games and playing as a big daddy is sick
[0:39:15] <heartlesshealer> @JoshManVGH Yup!
[0:39:16] <ChrisPlaysThing> Oops, all racist overtones!
[0:39:16] <+PrimalDweeb> The fuck?!
[0:39:17] <CanadianAnimatorGuy> I never played Infinite but WHAT
[0:39:18] <$SvenHolgersson> That would involve hirings POCS
[0:39:21] <+kyh9> And then the DLC of "NO WAIT, SHE WASNT GOING TO ACTUALLY STAB THE BABY"
[0:39:22] <$SvenHolgersson> And we can't have that
[0:39:22] <bob900000> really!?
[0:39:23] <%hewlettfan96> Bioshock is a fantastic game
[0:39:24] <+kyh9> Bioshock 2 is great too
[0:39:26] <+MauriceFaurron> I FORGOT ABOUT THAT
[0:39:28] <ergulor> nope
[0:39:29] <+ImExtremelyManly> there was a reason for that
[0:39:31] <+kyh9> INFINITE IS SHIT
[0:39:32] <PlaidisTheNewPlaid> Infinite is not great
[0:39:33] <%dankjerri> was there ANY black people
[0:39:33] <+kyh9> ABSOLUTE SHIT
[0:39:34] <SulfurousAcid> infinite is AWFUL lmaoooo PrideLaugh
[0:39:37] <Monkeyweed21> remember that this horrific racist town has zero racial slurs uttered
[0:39:37] <+ZephynM> The only infinite I want to play right now is Halo.
[0:39:38] <nomolomo> the first bioshock was also way more horror-like. cool spooks!
[0:39:40] <twistedj3ster> INFINITE IS THE WORST
[0:39:40] <%JoshManVGH> @dankjerri People need water, for sure, so take solace in that.
[0:39:41] <%g0atmeal> i only remember the aesthetic, maybe for the best
[0:39:41] <Mrbaconator> I DID and I don't remember that1
[0:39:41] <+HiroTSK5> On eof these days I'll play Bioshock
[0:39:42] <%Ranryu692> Infinite is the only Bioshock I have played LUL
[0:39:43] <$ErikFeral> Guys, Racism is Bad. Also, NONE OF YOUR CHOICES MATTER FREE WILL IS ALIE
[0:39:43] <pennykettle_> No you dont understand, the gingers MADE her do that!!!!
[0:39:43] <Vyskus> I feel old
[0:39:45] <+MauriceFaurron> it is literally what is happening
[0:39:47] <%waltzqueen> 10000% TRUE
[0:39:48] <%mighty_max_t> I remember that G4 put Bioshock as the 3rd best gaame ever (as of 2012)
[0:39:48] <%Kenzo2000> QUARK IS ANDREW RYAN
[0:39:50] <+cubbywolf> yeah because it was the same game 4x in a row
[0:39:51] <neroforte177> never name anything infinite ever
[0:39:51] <+Dirty_Dandere> It's soooo CRINGE
[0:39:52] <%hewlettfan96> INFINITÉ IS SHITE
[0:39:52] <Coystick> Bioshock Infinite is a waste of good concept art
[0:39:54] <Aleate> Infinite feels like a constant fever dream
[0:39:57] <Lancaster_H> not to mention the gameplayer was INFINITELY worse
[0:39:58] <DancesWitBalrog> I quit at THAT scene
[0:39:59] <$ErikFeral> More Like Bioshock FIN
[0:39:59] <$SvenHolgersson> So much wasted potential
[0:39:59] <boywunderkind> But also was like, “hey maybe the enslavers are victims too”
[0:40:01] <%baronblank> it's really funny cause I still remember only hearing how amazing infinite was when it came out and now everyone agrees it sucks lmao
[0:40:01] <CappuccinoGuil> The DLC for Infinite is GREAT because it lets you break the AI with an utterly OP invisibility ability LUL
[0:40:03] <twistedj3ster> I was screaming "THAT'S NOT HOW THAT WORKS!"
[0:40:03] <$SvenHolgersson> So muchhhhhhhhhh
[0:40:03] <@SoFarFetched> all I saw of Bioshock Infinite was the Crowbcat video
[0:40:03] <+kyh9> "HEY, I KNOW REAL LIFE RACISM EXISTS BUT IF YOU LET MINORITIES FIGHT BACK, YOULL GET COMMUNIST REVOLUTION AND THATS BAD TOO!"
[0:40:04] <%Saadi90> Infinite is terrible. I hated it
[0:40:05] <+ThomasOfTroy> I play infinite, it was fine. Not great, but fine enough
[0:40:11] <All_Salt> Crowbcat has a great video about what infinite could have been but wasn't.
[0:40:13] <%Genericho> what i remember everyone sucking infinite's dick when it came out
[0:40:16] <ChrisPlaysThing> Infinite is what killed Steampunk for a decade
[0:40:17] <@SoFarFetched> Armin,Arm Out?
[0:40:22] <%dankjerri> i liked infinite cause i got to use a c96
[0:40:22] <%JoshManVGH> The Lutece Twins are the ONLY good thing about Bioshock Infinite
[0:40:23] <Xenioplate> A MAN CHOOSES
[0:40:24] <nomolomo> on the mouth!
[0:40:25] <+kyh9> ITS SO FUCKING INTELLECTUALLY DISHONEST TO COMPARE A REAL LIFE FUCKED UP SITUATION TO A WHAT-IF
[0:40:31] <nomolomo> if your eyes could find it
[0:40:31] <DXLelouch24> Arise a FUCKING JRPG did slavery better than Infinite
[0:40:35] <$SvenHolgersson> Kiss him with or without the makeup
[0:40:36] <%Ranryu692> Quark would be disgusted LUL
[0:40:36] <%BallerSwagBro9k> Armin from Attack on Titan?
[0:40:38] <+kyh9> Bioshock 2 also did the Father-Daughter thing better than Infinite
[0:40:39] <%hewlettfan96> Infinité was such a bizarre detour for the series
[0:40:41] <pennykettle_> The Lutece twins are based and I guess trans idk
[0:40:42] <Maleicus> infinite possibilities but this one guy has to die in all of them smh
[0:40:44] <Piemono> Would you rub his lobes?
[0:40:44] <$ErikFeral> Armin is like a teen though
[0:40:44] <+kyh9> Eleanor Lamb >>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>> Elizabeth
[0:40:47] <%Ranryu692> a hyu-mon woman fully clothed? gross
[0:40:47] <nomolomo> time for the shitshow
[0:40:47] <$SvenHolgersson> Just grab those brows and go to town
[0:40:50] <PlaidisTheNewPlaid> All women love disgusting goblin men, who want to take their right to vote, this is a fact
[0:40:53] <+kyh9> Bioshock2-Bros, where we at?
[0:40:53] <Monkeyweed21> Remember when Booker saw that he was the fated pariah of Columbia and got warned what to not do and then did it anyway
[0:40:54] <%dankjerri> Wet ass lobes
[0:40:56] <boywunderkind> Infinite is literally “But both side are bad buhbuhbuh”
[0:41:03] <%Sotetsu> Woo, more incomprehensible nonsense language!
[0:41:08] <Monkeyweed21> OH GOD REMEMBER GHOST MOM
[0:41:09] <nomolomo> are we ready for a totally original story where you won't believe what will happen next??? neither am i

[0:41:43] <%Ranryu692> you mean best
[0:41:45] <$ErikFeral> Bioshock Infinite jumped the shark, only to go back in time before the shark was born and drown the shark's father
[0:41:49] <nomolomo> dw about it pat, your level of energy fits perfectly with this game
[0:41:53] <CappuccinoGuil> It's a no bones day for Pat
[0:41:55] <%JoshManVGH> Rom's got the lobes for workers rights, and that's great!
[0:41:55] <pennykettle_> oh dont worry the game is low energy mrmClown
[0:42:05] <Psyramics> Jak 3 and then Jak X
[0:42:05] <heartlesshealer> I SAW
[0:42:06] <DancesWitBalrog> Shitty Pat is godlike
[0:42:07] <Ipsenscastle> I watched that!
[0:42:09] <+qanonisadeathcult> every twitch streamer that goes full time creates two jobs.  The streamer and thejob they leave. Follow and subscribe to streamers!
[0:42:11] <@SoFarFetched> Paige needs you at your lowest energy so you don't sandbag her stream too hard,its all apart of her plan.
[0:42:12] <Psyramics> lmao no
[0:42:13] <PlaidisTheNewPlaid> You could do that
[0:42:14] <$SvenHolgersson> YEYYEYEYYEYE AND THEY CHEESED THE FINAL BOSS
[0:42:18] <+razielhex> jackbox dot tv fifty hour stream
[0:42:19] <Reveresao> Gigaboots do not sleep
[0:42:19] <Ipsenscastle> They actually enjoyed Jak X, which is bizarre to me
[0:42:19] <+dalmek> they're insane people though
[0:42:19] <+cvp5127> the racing one
[0:42:20] <PlaidisTheNewPlaid> Just buy some coke
[0:42:22] <%g0atmeal> jak x was ok but i'd love a modern remake
[0:42:28] <Ipsenscastle> It controls so horribly
[0:42:30] <+lordericter> they played Jak3 AND JakX
[0:42:31] <heartlesshealer> Jak III straight INTO a full Jak X play
[0:42:33] <+dalmek> KZ's Tak and the Power of Juju stream is powerful
[0:42:37] <bob900000> pat should do a 24 hour stream of ff13
[0:42:39] <$SvenHolgersson> I miss Jak and Daxter
[0:42:41] <professorbadvibes> they once streamed ratchet and clank for like 30 hours
[0:42:42] <CanadianAnimatorGuy> That was me with Metroid Dread
[0:42:43] <wolfen091> so nothing got it
[0:42:44] <professorbadvibes> the same game
[0:42:44] <$SvenHolgersson> lytCRYA

[0:42:54] <+Sullen_Walrus> elden ring?
[0:42:54] <thelonechris> Why does Pat look like he's trying his hardest to lean away from Paige?
[0:42:55] <%hewlettfan96> @g0atmeal aaaah Jak and daxter that’s a dead deader franchise if I ever heard of one
[0:42:56] <+lordericter> Bob was a corpse at the end of that shit
[0:42:57] <SaiyanShoto> Some people can stream for a loooong time, Max can stream for a long ass times. It’s nuts
[0:42:57] <ChrisPlaysThing> Devil May Cry 6, got it

[0:43:04] <$ErikFeral> The Villain of Jak X told Jak that he came out... of retirement to race. And Gigaboots thought he was coming out to the hero cause they were so tired

[0:43:23] <Aleate> we know
[0:43:28] <%hewlettfan96> To protect his gas
[0:43:29] <heartlesshealer> There was a hilarious moment in the middle of Jak X thanks to no sleep Dan
[0:43:30] <$ErikFeral> Pat is Kirby???
[0:43:32] <ChrisPlaysThing> His mouth is a portal to his butt
[0:43:35] <+Infernal_Dalek> Filling the couch with farts
[0:43:35] <+YourRedDog> What does it matter, Pat and Paige aren't real, they're all voices in Steve Buscemi's head.
[0:43:36] <DancesWitBalrog> Flesh and gas
[0:43:37] <DusK_The_Stray> What a gasbag
[0:43:40] <PlaidisTheNewPlaid> What if Pat laid across Paige, and then told her she was a good boi?

[1:03:04] <DancesWitBalrog> SAY NOTHING PLAYTHROUGH
[1:03:04] <pennykettle_> where are daniel and taylor?
[1:03:04] <All_Salt> This game seems like kojima scenes and nonsense jargon but without context or game
[1:03:04] <%GabeSweetMan> Fun Fact: The Selim Witch Trials are the reason for the 5th amendment because there were TONS of instances of silence being used as evidence of guilt!
[1:03:06] <nomolomo> it means... nothiiiiing
[1:03:06] <%SophiaAmoreaVeritas> @toastybites Because they don't. None of the motivations have been consistent during the ENTIRE game so far. It's great!
[1:03:06] <Essixian> Why's he so mad about the kid
[1:03:07] <HaroldDonchee> what could it meeann
[1:03:08] <theshillman> did paige take the meth or not?
[1:03:09] <shotgang86> more spools
[1:03:10] <MyNameIsRasus> "it means we should bang"
[1:03:11] <Delenay> why
[1:03:15] <+Forbidden_Karp> this dialogue feels so stilted sometimes
[1:03:19] <shotgang86> spooks
[1:03:21] <ohno778> your cursed as fuck
[1:03:21] <Delenay> and we didnt see the plaque

[1:03:22] <%JoshManVGH> Sleeping with your Non-traditional Students? How droll!
[1:03:24] <%greasypete00> why do they move their eyes like Thomas the Tank ENgine characters
[1:03:25] <SaiyanShoto> Jill and Chris got added to Fortnite LUL
[1:03:27] <+MarkoTolstov> how did they know?
[1:03:28] <+Bailey__Gaming> Did she say if they will do the new one too? After this one is done?
[1:03:29] <PlaidisTheNewPlaid> Even with the power of gentrified meth, this game makes no sense
[1:03:31] <+toastybites> its a ghost door
[1:03:31] <%g0atmeal> "they must be locked"
[1:03:33] <shotgang86> kick this door
[1:03:36] <%Ranryu692> what about how they got in?
[1:03:42] <shotgang86> mash woman

[1:03:46] <PlaidisTheNewPlaid> Gross
[1:03:48] <%Sotetsu> Good wark
[1:03:49] <dds333a> @plaidisthenewplaid it will make more sense later
[1:03:51] <%hrbeck_> but then we wouldn't have a qte
[1:03:59] <Delenay> really its kinda neat
[1:04:00] <dds333a> It may not be good, but it will make sense LUL
[1:04:01] <%Sotetsu> What was that?

[1:04:11] <MyNameIsRasus> UGHHHHHHHH
[1:04:11] <%Estuko> I'm laughing because I thought he was going to pull out a Pog, "I found this. It's pretty neat."
[1:04:11] <Monkeyweed21> UP
[1:04:13] <devanmuse> It will be SIGNIFICANT
[1:04:15] <%Ranryu692> did they let the interns make this game?
[1:04:16] <Deft_Thought> They look like they're lit in two different scenes
[1:04:17] <+Catpurnicus> were any of these games any good besides the first one?
[1:04:17] <%Keyd00d> it will be significant
[1:04:18] <PlaidisTheNewPlaid> @dds333a Oh, I know where this game goes
[1:04:21] <%g0atmeal> what a significant random keychain
[1:04:24] <BakiinPlaysStuff> These are the most cardboard people I've ever seen in a game
[1:04:25] <Xeno351> iTs SiGNiFicaNt

[1:04:27] <hearingthenseeing> what a cRaZy game
[1:04:34] <Mrbaconator> i think the villain is the devil
[1:04:39] <%hrbeck_> whaaaaaaat
[1:04:40] <%JoshManVGH> Ooooooooh
[1:04:43] <+Vampireinarm> feel like this could have been better with better actors/direction
[1:04:44] <dds333a> should you Kappa
[1:04:47] <%BallerSwagBro9k> @catpurnicus apparently the 3rd new one is really good
[1:04:47] <twistedj3ster> I think the villain is the game
[1:04:51] <Mrbaconator> in the heart of battle
[1:04:56] <%Sadira_snack_attack> Never help children
[1:04:56] <devanmuse> Maybe the answer lies... IN THE HEART OF BATTLE
[1:04:57] <%Estuko> I think the true villain is the friends we made along the way
[1:04:58] <%Estuko> wait
[1:05:02] <DancesWitBalrog> what is this writing
[1:05:06] <rustybuckethead21> I remember this. won't spoil how it ends, but is a wild ride.
[1:05:08] <%greasypete00> which path? the witch path?
[1:05:11] <%BallerSwagBro9k> @twistedj3ster no no the true villain is SOCIETY Kappa
[1:05:15] <%JoshManVGH> @estuko LUL
[1:05:16] <ohno778> are they gonna fuck?
[1:05:16] <+Vampireinarm> discoPride
[1:05:17] <%Garthunox> the answer lies in the heart of battle
[1:05:18] <nomolomo> just go lay down in the police station, sleep and wait for morning
[1:05:18] <+Gohyakuen> @Vampireinarm True, this could have been better if it was good
[1:05:19] <dds333a> pay attention Kappa
[1:05:19] <$sekoshi> I do gotta say  this game looks good at least but lord the writing/pacing
[1:05:21] <%Ranryu692> they're going to the witch trail. not to be confused with the recent with trial
[1:05:28] <tigerfang86> big teleports
[1:05:30] <DancesWitBalrog> Did the script fly out the window?
[1:05:36] <pennykettle_> I'm remembering so much about this game that led to nothing
[1:05:38] <@SoFarFetched> STOP WITH THE WEIRD CUTS geefDense
[1:05:44] <devanmuse> Has there been a monster or anything yet?
[1:05:45] <%Ranryu692> @DancesWitBalrog what script?
[1:05:45] <rustybuckethead21> teleporting dialogue, the finest
[1:05:46] <Deft_Thought> This game is just flying
[1:05:48] <+Mekhet09> I think her personality is just she likes guys.
[1:05:50] <DancesWitBalrog> S TIER EDITING
[1:05:52] <@SoFarFetched> no pee slow

[1:05:59] <%BallerSwagBro9k> THERE IS NO SCRIPT

[1:06:05] <PlaidisTheNewPlaid> Oh no, her butt exploded again!
[1:06:07] <ryderbootz> this game kinda not good huh
[1:06:08] <bob900000> wtf is happening
[1:06:10] <DancesWitBalrog> @ranryu692 wait, in the sky, is that the script?
[1:06:11] <graemecrackers2> go get some meth
[1:06:12] <Aleate> pat stream time
[1:06:17] <OvaltineDream> oh no not the hammy
[1:06:18] <Jaxnos> this is a spiral of pain cuz as no one likes the characters, even if the writing or plot was doing anything it would be impossible to follow because we're too busy being bleh'd to death by acting
[1:06:18] <Martinet111> Hey Pat you look hot
[1:06:18] <Dementedpenguin> Hey, Pat.
[1:06:20] <+athuramn> heyo

[1:06:30] <topendbuzza> whens until dawn Kappa
[1:06:30] <tigerfang86> RIP
[1:06:30] <PlaidisTheNewPlaid> Pat, tell us about your dreams!
[1:06:30] <%W1nterTitan> Hey Pat, why is healer a stressful nightmare?
[1:06:33] <twistedj3ster> sigh, I just got it
[1:06:33] <+AlteisenReiseZ> NMH3 FINISH WHEN
[1:06:33] <Deft_Thought> Nuthin. Neighbor's dog is barkin like crazy
[1:06:34] <+athuramn> LUL
[1:06:34] <Zeif00> Ay
[1:06:35] <+Mekhet09> What would?
[1:06:41] <DancesWitBalrog> this game isn't even funny bad
[1:06:43] <devanmuse> That's why you don't make a schedule 2 months in advance
[1:06:44] <afronooch> Honestly i'd be concerned if you didnt have a schedule change
[1:06:46] <PlaidisTheNewPlaid> Gloomhaven is a better boardgame
[1:06:49] <PartyFavors> I mean Gloomhaven is *good* I just don't think it's good *stream*
[1:06:49] <$chance_h> Just play connect 4
[1:06:51] <%BallerSwagBro9k> Pat u gonna finish NMH3?
[1:06:51] <+dalmek> team fixer
[1:06:53] <Martinet111> Hey hot stuff
[1:06:53] <%skm742> as someone who played the GH board game, I'm not surprised it's slow as hell.
[1:06:54] <+Rofiarf> healer is less stressful then tank imo
[1:06:56] <senfood> Playing healer is being a babysitter.
[1:06:57] <+Mekhet09> Healer is chiller then tank IMO.
[1:06:58] <heartlesshealer> Playing a healer means you have to play better than everyone else LUL
[1:07:00] <Deft_Thought> Did you play any Darkwood since the full release?
[1:07:03] <ohno778> And anything that goes wrong is always your fault
[1:07:04] <%cobalt_phoenix_> healer is chill idk
[1:07:06] <tigerfang86> I've played gloomhaven as a tabletop thing and it was fun but also long lol
[1:07:13] <dds333a> @shotgang86 DON'T WANT TO BE
[1:07:14] <$NitronStreams> Healer = human undo button
[1:07:15] <+CaptainPyron> I'm sure everyone told him, Jill and Chris are in Fortnite now. lol
[1:07:20] <OldManDeckardCain> no more heroes 3? more like no more streams
[1:07:23] <Vyskus> Tanking is easy imo
[1:07:23] <grotto_kein> Goats are like the goblin of farms
[1:07:24] <%g0atmeal> idk about 14 but in general healers get blamed instantly when anything goes wrong
[1:07:25] <cherrycottontail> tank is 0 stress
[1:07:29] <Jaxnos> the error thing + unavoidable damage, at least in 14
[1:07:30] <%Bluwizard21> guild wars healer was pretty fun
[1:07:31] <calzonewithextracheese> healers dying matter the most
[1:07:32] <SaiyanShoto> I played a controller in DCUO and that sucked cause that's the one who even the healers point to when things go bad LUL
[1:07:34] <bob900000> they put chris and jill in fortnite
[1:07:35] <Rumbutt> tank is so chill
[1:07:37] <%W1nterTitan> Likewise
[1:07:38] <+Rofiarf> i feel like the tank is the leader of the group
[1:07:38] <critiquequartz> Especially when the damage dealers don’t stop yelling at you for healing the@
[1:07:38] <ryderbootz> i am the tank, i get the bad guys mad at me, job is easy
[1:07:40] <Monkeyweed21> oops you cleaved the party while dodging mechanics
[1:07:41] <tigerfang86> tank seems pretty chill
[1:07:46] <%hrbeck_> tank stress leads to pain, healer stress leads to bitterness
[1:07:46] <%skm742> GH also works better when you have other people with objectives that may involve screwing you over.
[1:07:47] <+Catpurnicus> oh no
[1:07:48] <Martinet111> Pat watch the Sopranos
[1:07:49] <Qsmash_> I stress out when I don't know the dungeon
[1:07:53] <%BogBodyPositive> do you like back 4 blood?
[1:07:55] <illtima> That sound stressful as shit
[1:07:58] <%Ranryu692> Main Tanking isn't stressful. Off-Tank is stressful because they don't teach you how to do it
[1:08:01] <dds333a> @saiyanshoto I believe it LUL
[1:08:01] <sans86> healer starts stressful, then becomes jaded and cynical  as they get better
[1:08:06] <+CTMathiu> The thought of tanking was more stressful than when I actually just started playing tank
[1:08:08] <heartlesshealer> tanking is damage dancing basically, while healing is supervising
[1:08:10] <+Catpurnicus> Tank is + on OCD
[1:08:14] <tigerfang86> yeaaaaah
[1:08:16] <+Mekhet09> I guess I've gotten so used to healer so I find it less stressful then healer because a bad healer while I'm tanking is miserable. A bad tank can just be a DPS loss.
[1:08:16] <tigerfang86> yeaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaah
[1:08:18] <%SuckerPunchSyd> this is why i DPS
[1:08:21] <CatRidder> play with woolie
[1:08:23] <%BogBodyPositive> YAAAAY
[1:08:24] <+cubbywolf> god of war on PC? idk if I wanna play it again
[1:08:27] <SaiyanShoto> @dds333a It's was stressful LUL
[1:08:28] <tigerfang86> whoooooooooooo
[1:08:29] <%BallerSwagBro9k> YEYEYYEYEYE
[1:08:31] <thelonechris> I keep confusing Gloomhaven with Gloomwood
[1:08:34] <lethallylactic> LUL
[1:08:37] <MaybeFalco> LUL
[1:08:39] <DXLelouch24> Back 4 Blood bad so have fun
[1:08:39] <dds333a> Kappa
[1:08:39] <+JonathLP> FUCK YEAH BACK4BLOOD
[1:08:40] <%g0atmeal> i don't get toxic healers. help their team but be a jerk to them
[1:08:45] <+emperordread> Gloomhaven is cool fwiw
[1:08:49] <+athuramn> woolie in back 4 blood, I can't even imagine. he can't counter any of those zambambos
[1:08:51] <+JonathLP> Has Pat gotten too far in Inscryption?
[1:08:54] <tigerfang86> Back4RealBlood
[1:08:56] <%JoshManVGH> Tanks need to respond to the games actions, healers need to respond to the players. You can reliably predict one of these sets of actions.
[1:09:01] <%GabeSweetMan> Paige Borked
[1:09:01] <+JonathLP> Like did Pat get to spoilers in Inscryption?
[1:09:09] <DXLelouch24> Healers in ff14 decide who lives and who dies
[1:09:11] <nomolomo> playing a 'game'
[1:09:18] <+JonathLP> Sadge
[1:09:19] <%Bluwizard21> it goes from recruit which is baby mode to veteran which you will die in the first level for nothing
[1:09:20] <BakiinPlaysStuff> Oh hey if y'all play Back 4 Blood be aware that there's a mission where you have to protect a jukebox that is just blasting Motorhead songs
[1:09:34] <%GabeSweetMan> I'm a little sad Inscryption was a one off.
[1:09:37] <$cgreene64> I beat Inscryption and it rips
[1:09:37] <twistedj3ster> That game feels like the back of the truck fell off and the devs slapped some tape on it
[1:09:38] <dds333a> did I hear spoilers? don't mind if I do Kappa
[1:09:47] <scrumbotime> If you want to know what happens in Inscryption, Buy Inscryption. Buy it now. Buy it and play it, please, for your own good.
[1:09:49] <+ZephynM> Has Pat ever played Cross Code?
[1:09:52] <+JonathLP> @BakiinPlaysStuff Oh yeah, and you can't just shut off music, you need to shut off sounds
[1:09:54] <DaKnightWarrior> yay i made it.

[1:10:13] <%BallerSwagBro9k> Chat does it again
[1:10:14] <%octavian_wolf> card games do that to ppl, its rough
[1:10:14] <%cobalt_phoenix_> yea chat was awful that day lmao
[1:10:14] <cherrycottontail> Stoat says DO THIS, NOT THAT
[1:10:14] <dds333a> Allow me to continue Kappa
[1:10:16] <nomolomo> yay we're all together again
[1:10:16] <%g0atmeal> man chat sucks, i'd hate to be part of it
[1:10:17] <+Catpurnicus> the game has multiple characters that backseat for you anyway
[1:10:18] <nomolomo> in the fog
[1:10:19] <nomolomo> outside
[1:10:20] <%GabeSweetMan> Better or worse than Stoat tho
[1:10:20] <+Mr_Pylon> Every stream I've seen of Inscryption was just full of garbage chat
[1:10:21] <%Estuko> That really blows, I'm sorry about that Pat.
[1:10:23] <heartlesshealer> game is super spoiler vulnerable, so just play it yourselves
[1:10:26] <$cgreene64> I just played alongside Pat B)

[1:10:32] <+ThomasOfTroy> How bad was outer wilds? I don't remember
[1:10:35] <+JonathLP> @PeachSaliva Any plans to play House of Ashes after this?
[1:10:35] <devanmuse> Is that the same reason Great Ace Attorney was a one off?
[1:10:38] <PlaidisTheNewPlaid> Everyone wants to ruin everything for everyone else
[1:10:40] <+D00msDayDan> chat just can't help hinting at whatever the spoiler is
[1:10:44] <nomolomo> just wait somewhere inside until it's morning again I don't understand why they wouldn't do that
[1:10:47] <Monkeyweed21> SAY AAAAAAAHHH
[1:10:48] <dds333a> I AM YOUR DENTIST

[1:21:12] <dds333a> and he gets nothing LUL
[1:21:14] <+Ozwalldoe> Did you guys see that Jill and Chris are in fortnite now?
[1:21:14] <Sol_Install> LUL
[1:21:15] <%octavian_wolf> wow, you're right lol
[1:21:15] <%hrbeck_> hrmmmmm
[1:21:17] <Coystick> Neil Breen should do a video game
[1:21:17] <BigYanno> What a sexist heckin game
[1:21:19] <$cgreene64> :(
[1:21:22] <pennykettle_> I think thats just how it be
[1:21:22] <Rumbutt> so what your saying is you're killing off the characters he can play
[1:21:26] <Brother_Coduss> @PeachSaliva oh, so theres a chance they'll live then?
[1:21:27] <Jetsfantasy> You're killing all the vvomen
[1:21:29] <+ImExtremelyManly> it an andrew game
[1:21:30] <Teyaric> Oh, you mean this Not David Cage Game has SLIGHTLY mysogynist undertones in development?!
[1:21:30] <%GabeSweetMan> Y'know what would've been more interesting? If this Fatal Framed it and all these people were real and the ghosts were crowbarring them into the roles assigned to them for some fucked up ritual or some shit.
[1:21:32] <$Bt_Robot> What language is Pat speaking there? Is it even a language?
[1:21:32] <+MightyDuckShoes> Pat is feeling that glass ceiling
[1:21:35] <bob900000> paige is going to kill all the women
[1:21:36] <CanadianAnimatorGuy> Why didn't they burn her, it would make more sense thematically
[1:21:42] <%Ranryu692> @Brother_Coduss that's why he chose them
[1:21:44] <dds333a> so was i
[1:21:49] <nomolomo> witchtrails is a super interesting setting for horror
[1:21:51] <+gerngar> I heard the next game is a bit better about that
[1:21:53] <nomolomo> but not like this
[1:21:55] <%Sadira_snack_attack> House of Ashes is better
[1:21:59] <BigYanno> OK but why is Adam Warlock there?
[1:22:00] <$RealThiele> psyche!
[1:22:03] <Sol_Install> is house of ashes is better?
[1:22:04] <+ReallyBigRocks> Man of Medan was the one with the boat and the army mans right?
[1:22:06] <deviljhojho_> you had BIG hopes
[1:22:08] <$GarbageNirvana> The way these devs do stuff really doesn't lend itself to a whole lot of stories all that well
[1:22:10] <%Garthunox> not all of em can be hits
[1:22:13] <bob900000> the characters are really boring
[1:22:13] <%JoshManVGH> That seems to be the risk of these games in general, you could play with 5 people, but all 5 don't get equal play time.
[1:22:15] <%ceremight> yeah the dialogue is not great. like worse than average horror movie dialogue.
[1:22:16] <%Jamejarrs> The characters are all awful, I think that's my gripe.
[1:22:16] <DancesWitBalrog> the script is shit. let's be honest
[1:22:17] <dukenux> Hey it's that Midsommar guy
[1:22:22] <nomolomo> also all characters are super unlikable
[1:22:22] <%Garthunox> the one between until dawn and man of medan was shit
[1:22:22] <Monkeyweed21> Imagine being so lame that your stand is a Karen, a fat loser, an art student and a Ben Shapiro
[1:22:22] <%ceremight> House of Ashes thus far seems to be better!
[1:22:23] <bear_breaker20> like who but horror fans are going to play this
[1:22:23] <dds333a> @reallybigrocks yeah, big hallucination hours
[1:22:25] <Lancaster_H> its also very obvious that it's under budget
[1:22:26] <%hrbeck_> It's fucking confusing too
[1:22:32] <dukenux> aka "You guys gettin paid?" guy
[1:22:34] <+realm_forge> Wherever pat sits on that couch, he leaves behind a broken spirit
[1:22:34] <pennykettle_> I cared about the girl because short hair, but shes annoying
[1:22:35] <+Catpurnicus> the next game is going to be soldiers in iraq looking for chemical weapons, but instead they find a spooky ghost
[1:22:35] <stantheman_97> they really can recapture until dawn again, huh?
[1:22:37] <%ceremight> I mean I'm only like an hour and a half in but still
[1:22:38] <scrumbotime> no feel free to shit on them paige, just shit all over them
[1:22:38] <nomolomo> everyone is kind of a dick
[1:22:39] <%thejimjamz> Yeah it's not gripping me, but it's all good.
[1:22:39] <%weapon000> @BigYanno Wait you guys are getting solo origin movies.
[1:22:40] <%SovPho> almost time to repick the game?
[1:22:40] <draca23> The game would've been better if it was just 1 person puzzle game.
[1:22:42] <+xcompleasedad> Paige, the game is BAD.
[1:22:48] <$RealThiele> grandma church is  annoying so is daddy drinky
[1:22:49] <Sol_Install> No
[1:22:49] <deviljhojho_> A better twist woulda been to make a real devil that is trying to gaslight the progatonist into thinking its all fake
[1:22:50] <+Rofiarf> its bad
[1:22:53] <Zaphire_Saucypants> didn't this come out before that mess?
[1:22:53] <%GabeSweetMan> LUL
[1:22:54] <RagingLeo> WHAT LUL
[1:22:55] <+Bigchill___> I feel like there is very little reason to play the third installment with how much of it they've just shown with little to no mystique
[1:22:57] <Sol_Install> this came out way before this
[1:22:57] <Tracazoid> Isn't that just normal
[1:22:58] <JoshTheFace> LUL
[1:23:02] <SaiyanShoto> I mean if the the writers can write well then they should be shit one
[1:23:04] <stantheman_97> LUL
[1:23:04] <OldManDeckardCain> must be a huge issue in ireland
[1:23:05] <+nerdypanda> came out b4 covid

[1:23:05] <deviljhojho_> Eldritch language
[1:23:05] <nomolomo> a big man!
[1:23:07] <%g0atmeal> i don't think there's anything to defending the writers this time, it's just contrived
[1:23:07] <gooseonstilts> Theyre english you stupid fucking cunt
[1:23:07] <SulfurousAcid> I am NOT invested in these characters
[1:23:07] <+Rofiarf> i don't think the accent was irish pat
[1:23:08] <scrumbotime> pat is a big strong baby man
[1:23:08] <Aleate> It also doesn't help that 90% of the game so far has been "walk around in fog with nothing happening"
[1:23:09] <bear_breaker20> even the irish dont understand the irish
[1:23:14] <+Catpurnicus> I wish I was joking
[1:23:15] <ohno778> FEED PAIGE
[1:23:16] <%GabeSweetMan> psaBig BabyRage FamilyMan
[1:23:19] <critiquequartz> They’re try to tell two stories and they are radically different and both cheapen each other

[1:23:30] <Coystick> BRING HER THRESHED GRAIN
[1:23:31] <%cobalt_phoenix_> first just ham, now just bread

[1:24:08] <+realm_forge> I’m making keto waffles
[1:24:12] <%Saadi90> I had kebab and rice
[1:24:13] <+Catpurnicus> angela's reaction to hearing a british accent is going to be the highlight of this game isn't it
[1:24:13] <%JoshManVGH> Remember Emily in Until Dawn? She could have bern picked as someones controlling character, and she's fucking gone for 80% of the game
[1:24:13] <smoothwood07> just give her the bread

[1:31:41] <%GabeSweetMan> The terror of fleeing this INCREDIBLY slow-moving monster lady.
[1:31:43] <+ImExtremelyManly> dont kill da women
[1:31:43] <Sitromxe> Every time it dramatically zooms in on their faces the game gets a chuckle out of me.
[1:31:44] <MyNameIsRasus> QTEs, the highest form of gameplay
[1:31:46] <%Keyd00d> what if you like stomped on it
[1:31:47] <Frostydough1> its barely fucking movie LUL
[1:31:50] <CanadianAnimatorGuy> It's the most disarmed monster ever
[1:31:52] <+realm_forge> Why is this thing threatening?
[1:31:52] <%Genericho> How will we outrun this horrible monster that can only move by pulling itself with one arm.
[1:31:52] <Parapattern> It's VERY SLOW
[1:31:53] <rustybuckethead21> the highest skill gameplay
[1:31:53] <HaroldDonchee> oh wow good job john
[1:31:53] <ryderbootz> this sucks
[1:31:53] <%Sotetsu> It's really far away
[1:31:54] <augusta_wind> it's so slow
[1:31:54] <Dr_Mooose> I guess he just walked up?
[1:31:54] <dds333a> @g0atmeal he's got a lot of goo to share
[1:31:55] <$lumporr> about as threatening as ..like, what?
[1:31:57] <+ReallyBigRocks> "oh no they got away"
[1:31:58] <Maleicus> just does it himself
[1:31:58] <%Ranryu692> Angela probably can't get up on her own
[1:32:00] <Monkeyweed21> WAIT JOHN IS JUST FINE
[1:32:00] <%JoshManVGH> Why is it an angela qte for this dudes chapter
[1:32:01] <deviljhojho_> I-ITS MAGICAL

[1:32:03] <dds333a> *she
[1:32:06] <%thejimjamz> How can this be
[1:32:08] <Jaxnos> so it's the immortal snail
[1:32:08] <$lumporr> i'd be more afraid of a large spider
[1:32:08] <%Keyd00d> the goo
[1:32:10] <%Sotetsu> It's like the steamroller in Austin Powers.
[1:32:11] <+EyeFarted> CURB STOMP HER ASS
[1:32:12] <%SophiaAmoreaVeritas> There is NEGATIVE narrative tension. This is literally relaxing.
[1:32:13] <Sitromxe> Was it?
[1:32:14] <DancesWitBalrog> just do a body splash from the top ropes
[1:32:14] <%GabeSweetMan> LUL
[1:32:15] <Jetsfantasy> Angela would probably break her hip if she tripped
[1:32:16] <senfood> I wiss the one with random Peter Stormare.
[1:32:16] <shotgang86> it wasnt
[1:32:16] <MyNameIsRasus> IT WASN'T
[1:32:16] <%Keyd00d> Kappa
[1:32:20] <%greasypete00> does the goo make you bad
[1:32:20] <$GarbageNirvana> Fuckin
[1:32:20] <+ReallyBigRocks> by a hair
[1:32:21] <Coystick> That fucking haircut is the real horror
[1:32:22] <studleydoorite> iirc it wraps the victim up in one of th chains if it catches them
[1:32:23] <Junkles> I hope this guy is wasted by the end of the series
[1:32:24] <%JoshManVGH> Not really at all...
[1:32:28] <mike2hands> is this guy gaslighting us?

[1:32:57] <%g0atmeal> these "decision" cuts are really rough
[1:32:58] <%JoshManVGH> Why would ge need a gun against ghosts!
[1:32:58] <dds333a> these cuts LUL
[1:32:59] <HaroldDonchee> Angela threw the gun right
[1:33:02] <+ReallyBigRocks> now there's gonna be a monster with a gun
[1:33:02] <PlaidisTheNewPlaid> Why would you throw a gun?
[1:33:09] <ohno778> the game outright told you that you fucked up lol
[1:33:16] <Monkeyweed21> OH COME ON
[1:33:18] <theshillman> GUN good
[1:33:20] <Ipsenscastle> The whole 'curator' thing in these games undermines the story so badly
[1:33:20] <+cubbywolf> you showed an old lady a gun
[1:33:23] <%thejimjamz> Yo does gief have a heart shape fur pattern on his booty?
[1:33:26] <+cubbywolf> your actions doomed us all
[1:33:26] <tigerfang86> man this game sucks
[1:33:28] <%Ranryu692> @PlaidisTheNewPlaid out of bullets?
[1:33:35] <+realm_forge> This guy just brings the story to a hard stop
[1:33:36] <MyNameIsRasus> Not really
[1:33:38] <dds333a> @theshillman Zardoz knows all
[1:33:39] <PlaidisTheNewPlaid> @PlaidisTheNewPlaid Was it out of bullets?
[1:33:44] <tigerfang86> some BULLSHIT

[1:34:00] <+ReallyBigRocks> :O woah a hint!
[1:34:04] <dds333a> how generous
[1:34:05] <Teyaric> I don't know what this guys name is, but compared to the rest of the cast, he is ACTING THE HELL out of it.
[1:34:07] <Sitromxe> Ah yes, referencing better literary works as a crutch for your jank narrative. A classic.
[1:34:09] <critiquequartz> He should be a beginning and an end cap and that’s it
[1:34:12] <%thejimjamz> hint nyannPOG
[1:34:14] <+razielhex> I think I liked Peter Stormare in this role better.
[1:34:17] <shotgang86> "burp"
[1:34:21] <%GabeSweetMan> At least gas hallucinations meant that everyone was actually there, they were just seeing bullshit.
[1:34:25] <%g0atmeal> oh come on
[1:34:27] <+Catpurnicus> yeah this guy  is no stormare

[1:35:05] <Coystick> FEET
[1:35:07] <+razielhex> Pat is NO LIFE COACH
[1:35:11] <%JoshManVGH> He speaks in metaphor!!
[1:35:13] <theshillman> i dont remember that from 'arry po'ah
[1:35:13] <%Ranryu692> every time I try to picture Peter Stormare, I can only think of Stanley Tucci
[1:35:14] <BoxNavy> good job pat
[1:35:23] <%GabeSweetMan> Most Wandering
[1:35:23] <PlaidisTheNewPlaid> Truly Pat is a great life model
[1:35:28] <BoxNavy> nice :)
[1:35:29] <Zaphire_Saucypants> Everyone looks fucking high on this screen, whenever it pops up.
[1:35:33] <+razielhex> @Ranryu692 think of his role as Satan in COnstatine then
[1:35:34] <%thejimjamz> She looks like a boomer mom who disapproves of her daughters life choices
[1:35:36] <dds333a> @razielhex although Stormare was a figment that works as a counselor, whereas this guy is a legit narrator and curator "of stories".
[1:35:36] <PlaidisTheNewPlaid> Delicious succulent toast
[1:35:41] <$shurtal> Yeah Toast!
[1:35:43] <SaiyanShoto> Toast is mid, I prefer a tortilla

[1:35:44] <+MisterAvry> toast is important
[1:35:51] <NeroInfinite> my Door Dash dude forgot my drink. FeelsBadMan
[1:35:51] <Pappajimbo> is this implying the curator is the reaper?
[1:35:51] <+BubbaRands> Mmmmm toast
[1:35:57] <devanmuse> @PlaidisTheNewPlaid The snake prowls on the ground but cannot scratch its back, for as the Sioux people are aware: snakes have no arms with which to scratch their backs
[1:35:59] <KaitlynnHere> Pats also getting high

[1:37:44] <%JoshManVGH> Why is there electricity here?
[1:37:44] <KaitlynnHere> They need a character whose whole personality is that they’d lost their glasses and can’t see

[2:01:22] <teefpal> This is so absurd
[2:01:22] <HaroldDonchee> they think she's dead so I'm betting she's not dead
[2:01:24] <Zaphire_Saucypants> it's just a shitty "is she or isn't she?" kind of cut.
[2:01:25] <Aleate> When has a character in this series EVER died off screen and not on screen brutally?
[2:01:26] <MyNameIsRasus> THIS IS SO TRASH LUL
[2:01:26] <Heyestus> lemme just casually stroll away from this otherworldly apparition
[2:01:26] <zoogzin> you wait until it shows the button to press anything

[2:01:28] <+pleblu> Find a way out of the sewers, but nevermind tho lol
[2:01:28] <$GarbageNirvana> Off-screen deaths aren't a thing in these games
[2:01:28] <Jaxnos> i would fall apart in laughter if you can make choices earlier that just murders you offscreen
[2:01:30] <$FrostedZaibatsu> Eh, these games like to kill on screen
[2:01:32] <KaitlynnHere> Welp
[2:01:36] <+ReallyBigRocks> If they were gonna kill her off there why wouldn't it happen in gameplay?
[2:01:37] <sold515> video game
[2:01:38] <Sitromxe> It cut away before it got her, so the chance she's alive is probably approaching 100%.
[2:01:39] <Dead_Trickster> Oh no, the most toxic character is gone...anyways.
[2:01:40] <%Saadi90> I’m sure she is fine
[2:01:40] <%Ranryu692> soap opera rules: they're not dead unless you see a body
[2:01:41] <%g0atmeal> andrew she died like 2 minutes ago, you have to move on...

[2:08:52] <ohno778> Disturbing is that guy's favorite word
[2:08:56] <DancesWitBalrog> So, the plot of the game is little girl  is the Devil?
[2:09:07] <CanadianAnimatorGuy> TAKE a LOOK at THIS
[2:09:09] <+Catpurnicus> writers literally telling the player how they should feel in this scene because its so bland
[2:09:10] <shotgang86> the doll is the devil
[2:09:11] <+ReallyBigRocks> when's someone gonna make a game thats all in completely unreadable Old English
[2:09:13] <theshillman> little girl is well known devil
[2:09:15] <ChrisPlaysThing> It's also similar to the French word "Divers"
[2:09:17] <Aleate> It wasn't even the same doll...
[2:09:33] <AMajorTom> that bar was trying its best
[2:09:40] <holyxgrale> Are the mannequins turning their heads?
[2:09:43] <teefpal> Holy Divah
[2:09:43] <nomolomo> at least we're not at the point where characters don't believe each other. that's something
[2:09:47] <+MarkoTolstov> why do you think she wanted you to see THIS specifically?
[2:09:54] <Aleate> ???

[2:10:16] <DancesWitBalrog> why do i dont care about these characters LUL
[2:10:18] <Aleate> "Lets shoot it with a gun instead"
[2:10:19] <AMajorTom> most professors agree, burning things release spirits
[2:10:19] <pennykettle_> I hate character logic where they instantly jump to the most fantastical supernatural conclusions
[2:10:30] <+athuramn> why did he jam the spooky object into him
[2:10:32] <@SoFarFetched> Elmo is doing the best thing right now psaGib
[2:10:33] <KaitlynnHere> Oh…. It’s a child, nvm
[2:10:34] <+Catpurnicus> dolls telling people to set stuff on fire seems to be a theme

[2:11:56] <dan_g_v> no, not the patties
[2:11:58] <lol_red_ranger> People who startle easily have a guilty conscience about something usually :)
[2:11:58] <+athuramn> @misteravry very cuddly black cats
[2:12:01] <danknugglit> Let elmo play
[2:12:01] <KaitlynnHere> Gave pat a heart attack
[2:12:02] <PlaidisTheNewPlaid> Black cats are evil, because they are harder to see at night, so they can trip you easier
[2:12:03] <DancesWitBalrog> this game has FOV??
[2:12:04] <+Catpurnicus> "Hey, its that cat again"
[2:12:05] <holyxgrale> rustybuckethead21 A terrifying black cat walked in front of the window
[2:12:14] <MyNameIsRasus> Black cats ARE cuddly, there was a stray near the bus stop in my street that loved to cuddle
[2:12:17] <+ReallyBigRocks> I had a friend who I could literally walk around a corner 5 feet in front of her and scare her every single time
[2:12:19] <lol_red_ranger> classic
[2:12:21] <$GarbageNirvana> I have an anxiety disorder asshole
[2:12:21] <Davo46> That'll do it.

[2:12:32] <teefpal> That shit is awful, i feel for you pat
[2:12:32] <%g0atmeal> you can see the hd face textures load in every time they change shots
[2:12:34] <senfood> LUL
[2:12:40] <heartlesshealer> If you sink in the river you have a guilty conscience
[2:12:43] <nomolomo> the guilty conscience is such a stupid fucking argument for getting startled
[2:12:43] <MyNameIsRasus> It's Angela
[2:12:44] <NoHoldsBarredProductions> I jumped during Team America: World Police when the one puppet kicked the other puppet in the face from off screen unexpectedly. So I feel Pat's pain.
[2:12:45] <CatRidder> pat feels guilty for eating all the cheese
[2:12:45] <@MelBrooksKA> Pat feels guilty about Woolie killing that guy
[2:12:50] <KaitlynnHere> I’m feeling guilty about being exposed to bad things
[2:12:51] <pennykettle_> well I think factually, guilty people do get startled easier but being startled easy doesnt mean you feel guilty
[2:12:54] <Monkeyweed21> I startle pretty easily and I didnt get beat THAT hard
[2:12:55] <lol_red_ranger> @heartlesshealer correct
[2:12:57] <PlaidisTheNewPlaid> Pat feels guilty about all the money he makes being a dope-ass Gamer!
[2:12:57] <%Estuko> FeelsBadMan I am not guilty, just issues about being snuck up on

[2:13:14] <ExpressNode> I get that way when people touch me out of no where. Don't have any trauma but sensitive skin
[2:13:20] <cherrycottontail> people who go around thinking people have guilty conscience definitely have a guilty conscience

[2:16:15] <Aleate> D:

[2:16:39] <danknugglit> ???
[2:16:40] <teefpal> @ReallyBigRocks they leveled up their Tech tree
[2:16:41] <Sitromxe> They might look real in comparison to him, but that isn't exactly a very high bar.
[2:16:41] <nomolomo> every time there's one of those 'jumpscares' you should take a shot

[2:17:29] <%Bluwizard21> too bad andrew cant say the same
[2:17:31] <VritraReiRei> see the thing is, Until Dawn had some generally scary moments and that game didnt suffer from the problems this game is having 🤔

[2:17:41] <%greasypete00> are you guys planning on playing house of ashes in the future
[2:17:43] <NoHoldsBarredProductions> These mannequins about to turn into Fred from I Am Legend
[2:17:58] <$lumporr> @PlaidisTheNewPlaid no fun
[2:18:06] <PartyFavors> Why did they make the choice for the acting to be *so damn stilted* in a game that's entirely reliant on characterization and acting with no gameplay otherwise besides QTEs? Because this has to have been at least somewhat deliberate.
[2:18:07] <MyNameIsRasus> kick it dumbass
[2:18:07] <KaitlynnHere> See? She’s getting boinked

[2:20:52] <teefpal> Ah I love the FMA part of the Bibble
[2:20:54] <DancesWitBalrog> way too dank
[2:20:54] <%JoshManVGH> This always bothers me about horror media. "we are in a ramshakled rundown long abandoned building, and need to get out. there are 25 windows, without bars. Better find a door."
[2:20:56] <$lumporr> the eight deadly words: "I don't care what happens to these people."
[2:20:59] <$sekoshi> that's Catholic
[2:21:04] <+ReallyBigRocks> spirits are ghosts? souls are in people?
[2:21:08] <jkfd> what about the holy trinity?
[2:21:08] <PlaidisTheNewPlaid> A spirit is a soul without a body?
[2:21:09] <senfood> @AMajorTom Thank you for getting that reference.
[2:21:09] <$RealThiele> more ways to control the masses
[2:21:09] <+vaporousTippler> Some faiths argue the "soul" refers to an entire person.
[2:21:10] <+kyh9> Well you see, when you separate a body from its Soul, it becomes a Soulless
[2:21:10] <The_Legendairy> spirit as in the holy spirit maybe?
[2:21:11] <OneThousandTomatoes> ask the puritans
[2:21:13] <TTouchdown> We are having characters describe scenes that happened off-screen: bad. Said characters aren’t real, describing scenes to other characters who aren’t real: Terrible!
[2:21:14] <MyNameIsRasus> Kind of like Kingdom Hearts and "Heart, Body and Soul"
[2:21:14] <teefpal> @lumporr as a writer this is my One Fear

[2:22:55] <%JoshManVGH> Spinnet
[2:23:01] <Broand> Soul is like personality and consciousness, Spirit is like a divine connection or manifestation which is like your higher self. it's old hermetic shenanigans
[2:23:02] <KaitlynnHere> I want them to just start macking
[2:23:06] <+Catpurnicus> "we don't know why people even liked the first game"
[2:23:08] <+Kevlar_Caviar> DID YOU SEE HIS HAND WHEN HE OPENED THAT DOOR
[2:23:22] <+Kevlar_Caviar> WTF HAPPENED TO IT
[2:23:29] <holyxgrale> AngelThump
[2:23:33] <$lumporr> A spirit is extinguished, while A SOUL STILL BURNS
[2:23:41] <twistedj3ster> "Like mah dick"
[2:23:41] <Dead_Trickster> Curator, the spookiest thing about these short games.
[2:23:53] <OneThousandTomatoes> she's totally ok
[2:23:57] <teefpal> I wonder how much they had to pay this guy to keep coming back to these trashfires
[2:23:58] <+ReallyBigRocks> this mans posture is TOO good
[2:23:59] <DancesWitBalrog> the best character in the game!
[2:24:00] <KaitlynnHere> It’s her guilts manifestation
[2:24:00] <nomolomo> curator put on some fucking lights jeez
[2:24:00] <Sitromxe> But you just faked out her death. You aren't supposed to reveal she's fine yet.
[2:24:05] <+cvp5127> LUL

[2:24:19] <$lumporr> i'd hate to constantly be compared to peter stormare
[2:24:19] <DXLelouch24> Paige getting attacked
[2:24:21] <whycantipostasguest> these curator parts are really annoying and add nothing
[2:24:22] <SulfurousAcid> even the curator is roasting paige about letting the woman take her gun
[2:24:22] <+lordericter> They really blew their load on a good spooky narrator's with Peter Stormare huh
[2:24:26] <%JoshManVGH> Why is he so concerned about these assholes having weapons?
[2:24:28] <Dead_Trickster> Curator going "I STILL can't believe you threw away that gun!"
[2:24:29] <nomolomo> @BattlexQueen no same studio

[2:25:54] <Frostydough1> @PeachSaliva the knife has words on the hilt it says "FOR THE CHILD"
[2:25:56] <MyNameIsRasus> child stabbing is cool but reverend stabbing is even better
[2:26:03] <$lumporr> shivering with anticipation of child stabbing
[2:26:03] <%Ranryu692> Oscar Wilde was Irish and died in Paris
[2:26:04] <%greasypete00> john TITUS
[2:26:07] <Valentinius_Anodyne> If the child didn't want to be stabbed then maybe they shouldn't have been so small and vulnerable

[2:31:18] <nomolomo> stab the past!
[2:31:20] <%JoshManVGH> The reverend is the voice of the Lord so the Lord must be cool with it
[2:31:23] <teefpal> She died really quickly for that sort of hanging
[2:31:24] <cherrycottontail> implying this game has choices
[2:31:25] <%greasypete00> cut the rope with the knife you useless fucks
[2:31:32] <OneThousandTomatoes> make sure to nails to pin her body down so she cant be used for necromancy
[2:31:34] <+Logoth_> 1. Get the knife 2. Get the knife 3. Get the knife
[2:31:34] <HaroldDonchee> oops my hand slipped lol let's try again
[2:31:36] <+Undenizen> just joining! is the old lady alive?
[2:31:36] <PlaidisTheNewPlaid> But if they dropped her, she wouldn't get to hear him preach at her as she died
[2:31:39] <Aleate> Oh
[2:31:39] <pennykettle_> dont you usually drop someone in a hanging to snap their neck, not choke them out?
[2:31:43] <VritraReiRei> there is a reason why they drop people down from a high place. this is just wrong...
[2:31:43] <rustybuckethead21> "it's easy to keep control of a town if you hang one or two people every month" - Stronghold players
[2:31:47] <PlaidisTheNewPlaid> @Undenizen Maybe?
[2:31:48] <$lumporr> I promise You Will Never DIe
[2:31:50] <@MelBrooksKA> That seemed like a really blunt knife
[2:31:51] <Deft_Thought> These lines are so awkward
[2:31:53] <+polothegreatest> cops? crazy priest here is like god to them
[2:31:53] <ohno778> Carver better get it super hard
[2:31:54] <teefpal> This guy specifically has a horrible VA
[2:32:00] <+Undenizen> @pennykettle_ both work
[2:32:06] <teefpal> Like the girl at least is trying to emote
[2:32:07] <$silentblast93> so is this one basically final destination  pat and paige?
[2:32:13] <Zantetzuken> clever boy
[2:32:17] <+ReallyBigRocks> I mean I guess it's not that surprising that these pilgrim motherfuckers were extra cruel on purpose
[2:32:23] <teefpal> but the other guys putting in zero effort, its offputting
[2:32:25] <CanadianAnimatorGuy> I feel like they gave him a script and nothing else for context
[2:32:26] <PlaidisTheNewPlaid> @pennykettle_ But then she wouldn't hear them preach at her
[2:32:29] <+Undenizen> in a execution, a neck snap is preferable. a typical lynching uses strangulation

[2:33:36] <Deft_Thought> What the fuck was that even supposed to mean?
[2:33:38] <Sitromxe> Oh. This is the scene I think. The one where absolutely none of your inputs actually matter!
[2:33:41] <pennykettle_> women killer strikes again
[2:33:49] <%hrbeck_> it ok, pat wishes to be free of this game
[2:33:51] <danknugglit> How was that a good spot to hide

[2:34:17] <scrumbotime> because fuck you is why
[2:34:18] <PlaidisTheNewPlaid> Because it was badly made

[2:34:20] <%greasypete00> LUL
[2:34:21] <+Grayhammatter> this is awful
[2:34:22] <+Vampireinarm> because theres enough tim to pass in the slow mo parts
[2:34:22] <Dementedpenguin> Pass and play during a QTE, brilliant LUL
[2:34:23] <OneThousandTomatoes> they should have multiple controllers option
[2:34:24] <+Kevlar_Caviar> WHY DO THEY KEEP UPDATING THE TIMESTAMP THO
[2:34:25] <+ReallyBigRocks> its like a party game
[2:34:28] <danknugglit> ??? Why not walk around the car
[2:34:29] <holyxgrale> this is cooler
[2:34:30] <+Logoth_> Tension destroying
[2:34:33] <$lumporr> let's kill the pacing literally every ten seconds
[2:34:35] <%g0atmeal> so they can put you in QTEs where they don't tell you the controls
[2:34:39] <rustybuckethead21> light exercises while you play, I guess
[2:34:42] <%Ranryu692> this isn't as bad as some of those sequences in Detroit, but that wasn't designed for multiple players
[2:34:42] <+Sdeje> I guess it makes it more stressful
[2:34:45] <Aleate> Where did the car they just jumped over though...
[2:34:47] <%hrbeck_> WHERE DID THE CAR GO?
[2:34:48] <WeepProphet> stretch it bop it pass it
[2:34:49] <%greasypete00> she just teleported around the bus
[2:34:50] <%W1nterTitan> So it just teleports?
[2:34:50] <theshillman> honk honk gief
[2:34:53] <$silentblast93> whose the director of this game
[2:34:54] <Deft_Thought> These don't even look like people running
[2:34:55] <+Vampireinarm> theres totally enough time to pass without pausing
[2:34:57] <VritraReiRei> Time to play Hot Potato with the PS5 Controller BrokeBack
[2:34:58] <+polothegreatest> someone will die LUL
[2:35:00] <nomolomo> what do you mean threats
[2:35:01] <+ReallyBigRocks> gently hovering towards you
[2:35:02] <teefpal> You can literally outrun them
[2:35:04] <$Bt_Robot> did the ghost make the car disappear?
[2:35:06] <danknugglit> LUL
[2:35:06] <MightyOwl95> The car also wasn't real lol
[2:35:07] <+realm_forge> DUUUUUUUUH
[2:35:07] <+Sullen_Walrus> wasnt there an option to use 2 controllers
[2:35:08] <+toastybites> they catch up using slipstream
[2:35:08] <%greasypete00> you can outwalk them
[2:35:09] <$RealThiele> speed of plot monsters
[2:35:11] <nomolomo> they are literally just halloween decorations
[2:35:13] <pennykettle_> yeah but warp fog
[2:35:13] <+Logoth_> lol
[2:35:15] <$lumporr> she just wants to ask you something
[2:35:15] <BoxNavy> :)
[2:35:18] <OneThousandTomatoes> I think a pass and play option is required in case the players only own one controller, but still its bad design
[2:35:19] <MaybeFalco> LUL
[2:35:20] <cherrycottontail> the creature dragging it's toes like that makes me want to die
[2:35:21] <+ReallyBigRocks> thats a fucked up neck tho
[2:35:23] <whycantipostasguest> that guys face in the pause menu looks like he just shit his pants
[2:35:23] <+ReallyBigRocks> yuck
[2:35:24] <Deft_Thought> SHE'S NOT EVEN BEHIND YOU
[2:35:25] <PlaidisTheNewPlaid> Wasn't she in front of him though???
[2:35:25] <rustybuckethead21> wait until later on, I have high hopes for these monstars
[2:35:26] <Aleate> How difficult
[2:35:26] <$lumporr> like FUCK they could at least keep the music going or something
[2:35:30] <%SovPho> omg that face
[2:35:31] <holyxgrale> QUIT SCRAPING YOUR TOES LIKE THAT
[2:35:32] <Deft_Thought> I guess she is now
[2:35:32] <Zaphire_Saucypants> This is awful.
[2:35:32] <scrumbotime> They're fucked up spirit halloween decorations
[2:35:33] <BoxNavy> this owns
[2:35:34] <+realm_forge> DUUUUH
[2:35:35] <%JoshManVGH> This is a great bit
[2:35:36] <Deft_Thought> This is so weird
[2:35:36] <+pleblu> This isnt great
[2:35:40] <Qsmash_> this is awesome
[2:35:41] <%Ranryu692> is she naked?
[2:35:43] <Jetsfantasy> I do enjoy the aspect of them being chased by their killed alternate selves
[2:35:46] <tigerfang86> nutting REAL HARD
[2:35:47] <dukenux> i love how everytime you switch you have to look at Daniel's baked face
[2:35:47] <+Forbidden_Karp> this one is kinda creepy looking though
[2:35:48] <%hrbeck_> the toe scraping is the scariest part
[2:35:48] <%greasypete00> this is actually awful
[2:35:50] <%W1nterTitan> His face is great every time
[2:35:54] <KaitlynnHere> The QTEs from the first game were far more engaging because you had to stay still as the player
[2:35:57] <danknugglit> They can literally walk around half of these obstacles tho
[2:35:59] <$silentblast93> seriously this seems like a bad idea for pass and play
[2:36:03] <+realm_forge> His stupid face every 10 sec is great
[2:36:04] <Heyestus> is this section supposed to be silly? these faces abd sudden zooms on people are killing me LUL
[2:36:06] <+Grayhammatter> this is absolutely shit... wow
[2:36:07] <+RenoDeGeneric> That was the exact same set of animations as the first climb
[2:36:08] <youcanjustcallmejoe> my name jeff
[2:36:14] <+lethallunacyx> This is so bad I love it
[2:36:15] <Aleate> Zief desires violence
[2:36:16] <+Kevlar_Caviar> why do they refuse to actually show the monsters? it'd make sense if it was a closed space but this is a big open area
[2:36:17] <pennykettle_> Im glad the game reminds me of the time every time it switches
[2:36:18] <MaybeFalco> that whole segment is dumb
[2:36:18] <$lumporr> i think they expect you to be sitting right next to each other and passing the controller during the slowdown and not just be pausing it like a normal person
[2:36:20] <@SoFarFetched> WE'RE too beautiful? geefAww
[2:36:20] <shotgang86> gief is too beautiful
[2:36:20] <PlaidisTheNewPlaid> Handsome boy too pretty
[2:36:27] <VritraReiRei> what was wrong with just forcing people to use two different controllers NotLikeThis
[2:36:33] <KaitlynnHere> Handsome boy wants to slap
[2:36:36] <+polothegreatest> doodMash doodCrazy doodMash doodCrazy
[2:36:39] <holyxgrale> WHY DOESN'T SHE JUST FLOAT HIGH ENOUGH TO NOT SCRAPE HER TOES WTF
[2:36:41] <%Quigsies> It's like ATHF
[2:36:45] <dukenux> The floating guy meme
[2:36:46] <%Agami23> im pretty sure this game and the others are made with online multiplayer in mind. like to the point that you might have missed some scenes because your doing local coop
[2:36:48] <%doomunderthestairs> @SoFarFetched lunarLove  Happy to share!
[2:36:51] <+ReallyBigRocks> but they're really gross looking
[2:36:51] <Zaphire_Saucypants> I think it's supposed to be slow, like the purposeful crawl of death.
[2:36:52] <+G_Thunders> Pass-and-play is just a shoe horned co-op. All the effort for these games goes into making the online co op work
[2:36:53] <$silentblast93> power walk away from the threat
[2:36:55] <$lumporr> @holyxgrale she was running out of helium
[2:36:56] <+Logoth_> Nothing can defeat the quad laser
[2:36:56] <ohno778> dead bodies are gross
[2:36:59] <%Puhff> So Pat, what'sup?
[2:37:00] <twistedj3ster> what's weird is that this isn't the studio's first game, they shouldn't be making these mistakes
[2:37:01] <+Undenizen> they're GHOSTS pat! they're well known for their poor mobility!
[2:37:03] <KaitlynnHere> Just go
[2:37:05] <SulfurousAcid> look at zangeif!!!
[2:37:07] <%greasypete00> is this thing the snail that knows wehre you are at all times and is always moving towards you
[2:37:10] <holyxgrale> lumporr FeelsBadMan
[2:37:12] <critiquequartz> Just a pleasant jogging pace
[2:37:12] <%Agami23> yeah
[2:37:13] <KaitlynnHere> Zangeif save us
[2:37:13] <OneThousandTomatoes> that's silly
[2:37:14] <%JoshManVGH> Sakaguchi made it to the end of 4.0!
[2:37:16] <holyxgrale> Like dead space
[2:37:17] <%mighty_max_t> Dude, this game feels like it has no grasp on momentum
[2:37:20] <+ReallyBigRocks> wow thats garbo
[2:37:22] <@MelBrooksKA> That's stupid
[2:37:25] <KaitlynnHere> Nooooo
[2:37:28] <$Bt_Robot> Hey Pat, where did the items that they were climbing go at the end of that scene?
[2:37:29] <Sp3ctre48> Why would they do that though
[2:37:30] <%Agami23> its almost like this game is poorly designed and bad
[2:37:30] <$DEETRz> you guys planning to do house of ashes?
[2:37:32] <pennykettle_> I think you do miss scenes if it isnt online. like in man of medan they dont show you some scenes because youd see the twist
[2:37:32] <MyNameIsRasus> this is garbo
[2:37:34] <Aleate> Honestly I watched House of Ashes, and its MUCH better than this game
[2:37:35] <teefpal> Nah man of medan sucked too
[2:37:37] <DXLelouch24> Thankfully House of Ashes seems to be great
[2:37:38] <%greasypete00> are you guys gonna bother with house of ashes?
[2:37:38] <+realm_forge> A scary monster would be all of them fused together into one being with the ability to run
[2:37:39] <iamethanmars> love u pat!
[2:37:41] <Monkeyweed21> Man of medan was a fun B tier game
[2:37:41] <KaitlynnHere> It was a good game
[2:37:41] <danknugglit> Yea they dropped the ball
[2:37:42] <Zantetzuken> wait until you see part 3
[2:37:43] <%g0atmeal> this feels like a cash grab
[2:37:44] <nomolomo> it wants to be so much more than what it is
[2:37:44] <Heyestus> A Strong 3.5
[2:37:44] <+pleblu> Until Dawn was awesome
[2:37:44] <%Sadira_snack_attack> House of Ashes is pretty good
[2:37:44] <Parapattern> It's just straight up not scary
[2:37:45] <+silvery_cricket> This feels like it got rushed out
[2:37:45] <SaiyanShoto> It feels like it's made by different people
[2:37:47] <CanadianAnimatorGuy> Dark Souls 2 lol
[2:37:48] <Dr_Mooose> it dropped off hard
[2:37:49] <%Saadi90> House of Ashes is pretty good
[2:37:49] <+MightyDuckShoes> Noooo. You're going to make Andrew cry!
[2:37:50] <artoflec> god i thought man of medan was awful too
[2:37:50] <+Logoth_> Were they rushed?
[2:37:51] <Monkeyweed21> what did I miss?
[2:37:52] <+SimplyPandaz> Sony money
[2:37:52] <devanmuse> Do you remember Hidden Agenda, Pat?
[2:37:58] <theshillman> would you say the "Ball" has been "Dropped"?
[2:38:02] <+silvery_cricket> Like this feels like a first draft of a script
[2:38:02] <pennykettle_> I dont believe anyone who says the 3rd episode is good
[2:38:03] <MyNameIsRasus> Man of Medan was alright, not great but not terrible
[2:38:03] <+ReallyBigRocks> I bet the next one is gonna be REAL good
[2:38:05] <+G_Thunders> House of Ashes is worse than Until Dawn but still ends up really good by the end
[2:38:05] <SaiyanShoto> Also seems like there's barely any choice in this one
[2:38:06] <BattlexQueen> I really thought it was a bad ripoff
[2:38:09] <teefpal> It gets so much worse
[2:38:10] <$silentblast93> whose idea was it to do pass and play in this game
[2:38:12] <%JoshManVGH> Do they produce these in tandem with all the other parts?
[2:38:12] <+pleblu> This makes me wonder what happened with the company
[2:38:13] <mr_saturday93> house of ashes is much MUCH better trust me
[2:38:16] <rustybuckethead21> wait until later on
[2:38:20] <PlaidisTheNewPlaid> Man of Medan was ok, but got way worse when I saw the ending
[2:38:20] <Monkeyweed21> House of Ashes is WAY better than this game
[2:38:21] <Pappajimbo> There is a fire version of her with a huge stake on her back
[2:38:22] <Sp3ctre48> Would you say there is little hope for it to be better? Kappa

[2:38:31] <ExpressNode> Guess silent Hill will stay dead
[2:38:32] <%Quigsies> I've heard house of ashes is even worse
[2:38:32] <+tempestzephyr> pilgrims are boring pat
[2:38:34] <%Agami23> yeah its fucked up that the easiest one to do right is this fucked and bad
[2:38:34] <PlaidisTheNewPlaid> I wanted it to be supernatural, and the twist was just bad
[2:38:35] <BoxNavy> roo roo roo
[2:38:35] <$silentblast93> I mean on the dev team
[2:38:37] <+lordericter> they really just ran out of good scripts after Until Dawn
[2:38:38] <+Logoth_> bork
[2:38:39] <OneThousandTomatoes> had to much hope
[2:38:39] <bob900000> man of medan was like a 6

[2:38:58] <shotgang86> sipsipHellmo
[2:38:58] <%Agami23> people hated man of medan too, though i found that one ok
[2:39:02] <+pleblu> My dogs are barking with geif
[2:39:03] <%Garthunox> pat you should know better than to get excited about anything silent hill inspired

[2:39:14] <Ner234> LAMP SLAYER
[2:39:17] <Monkeyweed21> @PlaidisTheNewPlaid man of medan is at least saved by the fact that the stakes are real
[2:39:22] <OneThousandTomatoes> i feel like the not bad parts of this are draged down by stiff acting
[2:39:23] <KaitlynnHere> Lol

[2:39:26] <PlaidisTheNewPlaid> Paige hates lamps, as they allow others to see, and everyone should be as blind as her

[2:39:39] <teefpal> The worst thing is that it's BORING

[2:39:44] <BoxNavy> roo roo
[2:39:46] <@SoFarFetched> geefBlind
[2:39:47] <%g0atmeal> the only thing good is the graphics but that's just the engine, the art itself isn't great
[2:39:49] <%Agami23> paige, the anti-moth
[2:39:51] <KaitlynnHere> It’s big bore
[2:39:54] <theshillman> bork
[2:39:54] <%Ranryu692> Paige plays each day like a Hitman game where her objective is to kill lamps and doors and make it look like an accident
[2:39:54] <BoxNavy> autozone
[2:39:58] <PlaidisTheNewPlaid> @Monkeyweed21 True, but the ending drops it from a 7/8 to a 5/7 for me
[2:40:00] <stantheman_97> bark bark bark
[2:40:00] <teefpal> It's a perfect game to analyze for how Not to do horror

[2:40:42] <Monkeyweed21> @PlaidisTheNewPlaid yea thats fair,
[2:40:45] <%g0atmeal> did they lock him out???
[2:40:47] <+Grayhammatter> vince is like... wtf is happening

[2:40:49] <$Bt_Robot> Did you see the fence?

[2:41:00] <%g0atmeal> "that thing" his name is vince LUL

[2:41:03] <Coystick> Bitch ass ghosts
[2:41:05] <teefpal> Is he talking about the ghost... or the guy?
[2:41:10] <Monkeyweed21> @teefpal yea but it can still totally kill you, either from shock or from the armed pirates that are hallucinating to shit
[2:41:10] <bob900000> LUL
[2:41:12] <$lumporr> since when did doors stop supernatural threats
[2:41:14] <+Ilpala> it's a FLOATING CORPSE what is it gonna beat the door down?

[2:41:30] <+xcompleasedad> Did she kill da woman?
[2:41:32] <+silvery_cricket> WHO THE FUCK SAYS OLD FOOL
[2:41:33] <ohno778> lol
[2:41:33] <theshillman> WHY ARE THEY LIKE THIS THEY SAW HIM
[2:41:35] <Heyestus> why would a physical barrier work against teleporting evil?
[2:41:39] <%greasypete00> no shit
[2:41:44] <Aleate> I saw that
[2:41:45] <Zantetzuken> you fool! your form is poor

[2:42:22] <DXLelouch24> what did i say
[2:42:22] <%greasypete00> look at my head wound fucker
[2:42:25] <DXLelouch24> NOTHING IS REAL
[2:42:28] <VritraReiRei> so Until Dawn had a supernatural element and Man of Medan was explained that they were all hallucinating. Anyone want to take a guess if this is real or fake?
[2:42:29] <Sp3ctre48> what
[2:42:30] <$lumporr> isn't there a ghost chasing you, why are you holding the door open
[2:42:31] <Aleate> Oh. Thank you dude.
[2:42:31] <DXLelouch24> its all lies
[2:42:33] <danknugglit> LUL
[2:42:34] <@SoFarFetched> "you and me both man" geefThink
[2:42:35] <PlaidisTheNewPlaid> Well he came around real quick
[2:42:36] <%g0atmeal> help for what?
[2:42:39] <%Puhff> WTFFFF???????
[2:42:40] <$lumporr> woah that was a quick change of heart
[2:42:41] <teefpal> Hes literally just racist
[2:42:42] <stantheman_97> the cuts feel so weird
[2:42:46] <ohno778> sooo is vince dead like the rest of them?
[2:42:47] <holyxgrale> I agree with john
[2:42:51] <HaroldDonchee> what the fuck is he? he can't see it or just doesn't care?
[2:42:53] <scrumbotime> the ghost of the racist dad
[2:42:57] <KaitlynnHere> I took a huge hit man, I don’t think I’ll be sober for a week
[2:42:58] <Monkeyweed21> ITS THE GHOST OF YOUR RACIST DAD
[2:42:59] <Sp3ctre48> Those cuts made him look like two different people
[2:43:00] <%JamesCorck> This is starting to remind me of Season 4 of 13 Reasons Why, tone wise at least, and writing wise.
[2:43:01] <%greasypete00> how long has it been since the bus crash, it happened at lkike 3 am shouldnt the sun be nearly out
[2:43:03] <rustybuckethead21> this cuts together with the ways the models work in this game just really take me out of the mood. not only the dialogue.
[2:43:06] <%JamesCorck> The writing is really bad.
[2:43:10] <%JoshManVGH> No one is concerned that it just ignored the other guy?
[2:43:11] <@SoFarFetched> I feel like that abandoned option is still there if you said no
[2:43:17] <teefpal> @JamesCorck They made FOUR seasons?!
[2:43:19] <%Quigsies> ???
[2:43:22] <Sp3ctre48> @JamesCorck oh that's just mean LUL
[2:43:22] <+Grayhammatter> what?
[2:43:22] <$lumporr> all these people look like shit
[2:43:23] <%Puhff> ....what?!
[2:43:23] <rustybuckethead21> ??????????
[2:43:25] <Dr_Mooose> huh??
[2:43:27] <%JamesCorck> @teefpal Oh yeah they did.
[2:43:28] <OneThousandTomatoes> what
[2:43:28] <stantheman_97> huh?
[2:43:30] <%mighty_max_t> When??
[2:43:32] <KaitlynnHere> Orgy?
[2:43:33] <PlaidisTheNewPlaid> Ahh, yes
[2:43:34] <%g0atmeal> i don't remember that
[2:43:36] <+pleblu> Whats going on
[2:43:37] <thefranchise00> this editing is god awful
[2:43:37] <scrumbotime> off screen ghost zone
[2:43:37] <+xcompleasedad> The game is broken because you are playing it single player @PeachSaliva
[2:43:39] <@SoFarFetched> WHEN
[2:43:40] <PlaidisTheNewPlaid> Meh-Reah
[2:43:40] <Aleate> Oh god Chris and Jill got announced for Fortnite...
[2:43:43] <@MelBrooksKA> This is really bad
[2:43:43] <jett_eyes> this game is ass
[2:43:45] <%Garthunox> pat tell paige about the taylor thing in the museum
[2:43:47] <OneThousandTomatoes> oh my god
[2:43:47] <%Keyd00d> not this time
[2:43:49] <+Grayhammatter> what the fuck is happening?
[2:43:50] <fuji_n2> They saw she online
[2:43:53] <KenzBurp> Did Angela die while I was gone? gdi
[2:43:55] <pennykettle_> that chatter is 100% correct
[2:43:57] <+Vampireinarm> totally
[2:43:57] <+YPFrost> where did the old lady go i stepped away for a sec
[2:44:08] <Dementedpenguin> That's just garbage design if true.
[2:44:08] <MyNameIsRasus> Wow that suuuuucks
[2:44:11] <@SoFarFetched> "ONLINE ONLY"
[2:44:12] <%g0atmeal> so everyone gets half the story?
[2:44:12] <scrumbotime> because fuck you is why
[2:44:15] <pennykettle_> man of medan DID DO IT
[2:44:18] <Heyestus> I do love how every pause-screen mugshot looks super baked.
[2:44:23] <DXLelouch24> does Ashes do that?
[2:44:24] <%Piemen99> @YPFrost probably dead, we don't know
[2:44:25] <Aleate> They do it in House of Ashes too I think...
[2:44:26] <Monkeyweed21> Man of Medan did it with some of the hallucinations
[2:44:27] <$lumporr> maybe it's just bad!
[2:44:28] <DracaenaLeaf> dual stream when
[2:44:30] <ape_hawk> is that Adam Warlock?!?!??!!
[2:44:34] <DXLelouch24> maybe the games just bad
[2:44:37] <ExpressNode> Guess is was B movie night mode
[2:44:37] <jett_eyes> Bad game is Bad
[2:44:38] <+G_Thunders> Yep, playing single player or offline co-op means you miss 25% of the content, even in man of Medan
[2:44:39] <%Ranryu692> @ape_hawk yes
[2:44:40] <KaitlynnHere> @ape_hawk I think so
[2:44:40] <%Puhff> What an awful idea
[2:44:41] <hearingthenseeing> The real twist
[2:44:41] <MyNameIsRasus> That's just bad game design
[2:44:44] <bob900000> it did
[2:44:47] <+polothegreatest> LUL
[2:44:48] <DancesWitBalrog> RePlAyAbIlItY LUL
[2:44:49] <holyxgrale> Woohoo
[2:44:50] <teefpal> What.
[2:44:51] <devanmuse> i don't think it was AS obvious in Medan
[2:44:51] <Sp3ctre48> Why can't they just make Until Dawn again
[2:44:53] <Monkeyweed21> where two players would see different versions of the same scene because of the hallucinations
[2:44:59] <+pleblu> Spiderbite ball guy
[2:44:59] <%Puhff> Yay, I'm sure it will suck like the ladt one
[2:44:59] <+jK00215> why does this character look lik Sid from Toy Story?
[2:45:01] <DXLelouch24> well we know he can be an asshole so he passed
[2:45:01] <%JoshManVGH> Are these weird Bandai Namco decisions?
[2:45:03] <Mister_McDerp> game sux
[2:45:05] <+Chronobot> eyebrows kid, became eyebrow warlock
[2:45:06] <Qsmash_> kinda weird they're still making Marvel movies
[2:45:07] <%Garthunox> what happens if you play it solo?
[2:45:14] <critiquequartz> You can see the two player perspective if you play the other mode that’s what it is second player online prospective
[2:45:14] <TheHeroAppears> hopefully he doesn't piss on any sacred trees
[2:45:15] <Aleate> Gorl
[2:45:17] <Essixian> @jK00215 It's the mouth and forehead
[2:45:18] <$lumporr> did you guys not close all the doors
[2:45:25] <pennykettle_> Man of Medan did it because when the gas made you think a character was a monster, a player was on both sides of the encounter. One player thought there was a monster, the other player saw their friend acting crazy
[2:45:27] <shotgang86> heh, "tied up"
[2:45:28] <jett_eyes> the pacing is bad too
[2:45:28] <Sp3ctre48> @Garthunox You just don't see the scenes apparently
[2:45:29] <%cobalt_phoenix_> STAB
[2:45:32] <cherrycottontail> wasn't that actor also the joker
[2:45:36] <Pappajimbo> Thanos is behind it all
[2:45:44] <PlaidisTheNewPlaid> @cherrycottontail In Gotham right?
[2:45:46] <holyxgrale> KNIFE TIME?
[2:45:56] <%Puhff> This story makes absolutely no ense
[2:45:57] <%weapon000> stab the child
[2:45:59] <KaitlynnHere> Stabble time
[2:45:59] <%JoshManVGH> @pennykettle_ Ok that's pretty cool then
[2:45:59] <%Puhff> sense*
[2:46:01] <+Grayhammatter> these cuts are fucking wack
[2:46:18] <$Bt_Robot> remember that fence in front of the church?
[2:46:18] <ExpressNode> Just saw news that Fornite is adding Chris and Jill
[2:46:19] <+cubbywolf> there was one darts and one other one
[2:46:21] <whycantipostasguest> i keep trying to skip ahead but its live NotLikeThis
[2:46:22] <+cubbywolf> I think you did do it
[2:46:25] <%g0atmeal> this looks like a scene from until dawn
[2:46:25] <%greasypete00> check controls?
[2:46:26] <holyxgrale> There's many design problems
[2:46:31] <%SovPho> lol jump scares
[2:46:35] <rustybuckethead21> @Grayhammatter yes they are
[2:46:36] <%SovPho> the mcdonalds of horror
[2:46:36] <dukenux> DING
[2:46:37] <Reanimator83> @cherrycottontail that's the actor from Fallen Order
[2:46:38] <jett_eyes> Why not just have the ability to use two controllers?
[2:46:42] <%cobalt_phoenix_> BING BONG
[2:46:43] <pennykettle_> @JoshManVGH its definitely a good implementation but the streamers I watched play it were in a voice call so they accidentally spoiled it at the very start
[2:46:48] <%Ranryu692> they probably assume you're sitting next to the person who did get the tutorial
[2:46:51] <cherrycottontail> @cherrycottontail I think so? Is that the one with the penguin who kinda looks like toby mcguire
[2:46:58] <$lumporr> why is that dude so crazy
[2:47:02] <KaitlynnHere> That usually scares me, but it didn’t. And I have PTSD
[2:47:05] <danknugglit> This kid loves watching executions
[2:47:14] <%greasypete00> shouldnt they hang this one because its a high up place
[2:47:17] <%g0atmeal> why is she at the execution?
[2:47:19] <tanarath> Is it argon or mining gas doing this to them?
[2:47:21] <+shootbang_exe> the performances are super wooden
[2:47:26] <pennykettle_> @g0atmeal shes the accuser
[2:47:27] <rustybuckethead21> where is he looking at?
[2:47:28] <+JonathLP> I love making kids watch executions
[2:47:28] <$lumporr> all of these people look like someone made them out of clay and just didn't finish
[2:47:30] <%Piemen99> Man religion was a mistake
[2:47:30] <Sp3ctre48> Her voice acting is really not good
[2:47:31] <+SWFanatic> why are christians so mean
[2:47:31] <OneThousandTomatoes> eh breh hem
[2:47:37] <Heyestus> Everyone in the 1600s has a Yorkshire accent :)
[2:47:41] <dukenux> weird way of execution, but k
[2:47:45] <%greasypete00> what if its god tho
[2:47:47] <teefpal> This is the only interesting thing this game does
[2:47:49] <BoxNavy> D:
[2:47:52] <dukenux> yea why not just stab him
[2:47:53] <$lumporr> what an asshole
[2:47:53] <HaroldDonchee> that's kinda nuts
[2:47:55] <+cubbywolf> devil power saved him
[2:47:57] <+gitgouda> shoulda parried
[2:47:57] <%Ranryu692> that's the knife Taylor has in the future
[2:47:58] <+cubbywolf> oh wait
[2:48:00] <%W1nterTitan> Right??
[2:48:01] <%g0atmeal> now they have to clean it up
[2:48:02] <HazelnutBagel> he's fine..
[2:48:02] <dukenux> RIGHT?
[2:48:03] <$lumporr> why is this dude a serial killer
[2:48:03] <%Puhff> Wow these characters look awful
[2:48:04] <thefranchise00> who dat
[2:48:08] <CatRidder> he use the knife against you
[2:48:08] <@SoFarFetched> no of"fence" to them I guess Kappa
[2:48:08] <KaitlynnHere> This seems like a weird way to kill someone
[2:48:09] <+Ilpala> these sadists are just coming up with new ways to kill people for funsies now
[2:48:13] <%greasypete00> that seems so inefficient
[2:48:14] <%Ranryu692> or at least it's the same model
[2:48:15] <pennykettle_> yeah this aspect is totally cool. Future person trying to intervene is actually the ghostly presence
[2:48:16] <KaitlynnHere> RIGHT??
[2:48:16] <%SveriSageAdvice> at this point, i would shove the prosecutors off
[2:48:16] <VritraReiRei> Ooh, doesnt THAT death look familiar Kappa
[2:48:17] <AMajorTom> it's like poetry
[2:48:18] <+ReallyBigRocks> the dinosaur knife
[2:48:18] <ohno778> holloween decorations
[2:48:18] <$Bt_Robot> Oopsie Poopsie!
[2:48:18] <Parapattern> Just chop his head off with an axe or something
[2:48:23] <+SWFanatic> ghost knife future shank
[2:48:27] <dukenux> He's Pat
[2:48:28] <%SveriSageAdvice> like i would want to see if i could somehow mess with the past
[2:48:30] <studleydoorite> because it's metal, puritans love metal
[2:48:33] <Deft_Thought> Like they're gonna have to take his ass down
[2:48:34] <@MelBrooksKA> To make a point
[2:48:38] <HaroldDonchee> just wash it off. it'll be fine
[2:48:39] <Pappajimbo> Time noife
[2:48:43] <MyNameIsRasus> Just punch the priest
[2:48:43] <$lumporr> wait yeah
[2:48:49] <KaitlynnHere> @melbrookska -sigh-
[2:48:49] <danknugglit> That would SUCK to clean up
[2:48:49] <shotgang86> just punch the priest
[2:48:51] <BoxNavy> yeah pee on em
[2:48:51] <jett_eyes> The whole plot happened because of One Guy
[2:48:58] <shotgang86> style on his ass
[2:49:01] <MaybeFalco> piss all over their pants
[2:49:03] <%doomunderthestairs> jet stream pee on em
[2:49:07] <MyNameIsRasus> Kick him in his godfearing ass
[2:49:10] <shotgang86> you punch the priest - "BADASS!"
[2:49:14] <%g0atmeal> i just heard about witch trials... shit's fucked up man
[2:49:17] <dukenux> "Just learned about witch trials. Shit's fucked!"
[2:49:18] <$lumporr> it sounds like she was comforting him after a shitty day at work
[2:49:19] <PlaidisTheNewPlaid> So Angela is dead?
[2:49:20] <+pleblu> I know right? Fucking witch trials
[2:49:22] <%doomunderthestairs> owowowowoowow
[2:49:22] <+realm_forge> Stab the knife, take its ghost, then fight the ghosts with the ghost knife
[2:49:23] <+SWFanatic> so spoopy
[2:49:25] <scrumbotime> Angela was killed, except she wasn't
[2:49:25] <+polothegreatest> priest wants the gurl
[2:49:28] <studleydoorite> he JUST said "I'm next"
[2:49:30] <shotgang86> punch again - "SICK SKILLS!"
[2:49:31] <%greasypete00> hes telling you to keep an eye out you fuck
[2:49:32] <+Kevlar_Caviar> wait i thought the narrator guy said she was alive?
[2:49:36] <$lumporr> "isn't it better to accept your defeat"
[2:49:37] <HaroldDonchee> if you die in the past you die for real life
[2:49:37] <Srthunda> so it can float higher
[2:49:44] <%W1nterTitan> They fly now
[2:49:44] <KaitlynnHere> I. Don’t. Care.
[2:49:47] <+Forbidden_Karp> quick, let's speedwalk away from it!
[2:49:49] <MyNameIsRasus> This game is like trash in every sense imaginable wtf
[2:49:50] <%Ranryu692> @Kevlar_Caviar they don't know that
[2:49:53] <+polothegreatest> embrace hopelessness
[2:49:58] <danknugglit> Its just floating there MENACINGLY
[2:49:59] <+realm_forge> Ooooooooo careful I’ll drift at youuuuuuuu
[2:50:02] <%greasypete00> what happens if oyu get caught by it what can it actually do
[2:50:02] <%Puhff> Yeah better lock the doors to keep the ghost out.........
[2:50:05] <Parapattern> We run?
[2:50:08] <+SWFanatic> invite the ghost to a tea party
[2:50:09] <MaybeFalco> what is it even going to do?
[2:50:09] <$lumporr> like do you think it's just hanging out
[2:50:09] <+ReallyBigRocks> it won't be able to get it's rope through the door
[2:50:12] <jett_eyes> "Oh no! We have to lightly jog to get away!"
[2:50:14] <+pleblu> They can walk away at a brisk pace and escape
[2:50:16] <cherrycottontail> the next monster is just gonna be stationary, impaled on a fence
[2:50:19] <PlaidisTheNewPlaid> IS it though?
[2:50:19] <+SWFanatic> ghosts HATE solid buildings
[2:50:24] <+electric_bees> at least the monsters are kinda cool looking
[2:50:26] <OneThousandTomatoes> it'd be so much more interesting to me if the professor was a american history professor than a creative writing professor
[2:50:32] <%Garthunox> its the opposite of the wendigo
[2:50:34] <shotgang86> she would NOT say that
[2:50:34] <ohno778> so can you punch the ghosts?
[2:50:35] <Pappajimbo> When nyanners and ironmouse played the online had a bunch of bugs
[2:50:37] <$lumporr> yeah because clearly the CHURCH is the best location for all these RELIGION MURDERS
[2:50:45] <DancesWitBalrog> building is made with HOLY wood and iron so ghost HATE it
[2:50:47] <nomolomo> like a crawlspace
[2:50:48] <Deft_Thought> How fucking sanctified can this church be when a man got murdered out the window
[2:50:49] <ape_hawk> the best place to stay is wherever the most steaks is
[2:50:51] <HaroldDonchee> you'd be much safer out in the open in the dark
[2:50:52] <%Puhff> This is all very scary considering none of these people are real (probably)
[2:50:55] <%doomunderthestairs> kill child
[2:50:58] <Aleate> Stab the child
[2:50:59] <teefpal> I only know Phantom from Lindsey Ellis videos
[2:50:59] <AMajorTom> he will burn you with the heat of his eyes
[2:51:02] <holyxgrale> FeelsAmazingMan KNIFE TIME?
[2:51:02] <shotgang86> kill the child
[2:51:03] <+SWFanatic> i fell asleep during phantom of the opera
[2:51:03] <@MelBrooksKA> KILL CHILD!
[2:51:08] <%Ranryu692> as if they would let you do that
[2:51:10] <%g0atmeal> what if the ending is SO GOOD that we love the game instead
[2:51:10] <$Bt_Robot> Stab
[2:51:11] <DancesWitBalrog> CHILD THE KILL
[2:51:11] <BoxNavy> we always wanted to see that
[2:51:12] <dukenux> DESTROY THE CHILD
[2:51:14] <nomolomo> why would you move into the room with these huge windows
[2:51:15] <MyNameIsRasus> STAB THE PRIEST THO
[2:51:16] <ChrisPlaysThing> And the PROM is TOMORROW!
[2:51:17] <+MightyDuckShoes> What terrible direction. The camera sets on people with the facial equivalent  of a T-Pose and then they start over expressing like crazy.
[2:51:18] <+NiktenKing> Clipped
[2:51:18] <+Forbidden_Karp> reminds me of Midnight Mass
[2:51:21] <%BinaryFireball> once again Pat's fixation on child murder comes around
[2:51:22] <Zaphire_Saucypants> I love watching Pat stabbing children.
[2:51:22] <teefpal> @g0atmeal Oh its good at something
[2:51:23] <DancesWitBalrog> KID THE STABBY STAB
[2:51:23] <theshillman> Knife => Child
[2:51:23] <DXLelouch24> a kid thats not even real probably Paige its a victimless crime
[2:51:25] <Aleate> Lets stop and read this
[2:51:26] <KaitlynnHere> If it goes around your armpit it can still kill you, it’d just hurt your arm too
[2:51:28] <rustybuckethead21> you think a game will be brave enough to let you stab a kid in this day and age?
[2:51:28] <shotgang86> R2 Pat
[2:51:28] <+EyeFarted> 3 feet isn't far Pat...
[2:51:34] <+Schrodingers_Box> Pat hasnt used his one
[2:51:35] <holyxgrale> Pent up mass effect rage FeelsBadMan
[2:51:37] <%Garthunox> pats lifelong dream will be fulfilled paige, why would you deny him that?
[2:51:40] <Zaphire_Saucypants> I bet you could, Pat. I bet you could.
[2:51:42] <ape_hawk> pat, youre the same size as a child
[2:51:42] <SaiyanShoto> I bet a kid can throw you really far too
[2:51:44] <VritraReiRei> a lot (unreadable) people died 🤔
[2:51:44] <%Puhff> Could you even grab a kid with your baby hands?
[2:51:46] <+SWFanatic> lol
[2:51:46] <+ReallyBigRocks> :)
[2:51:47] <danknugglit> LUL
[2:51:48] <%g0atmeal> at least midnight mass had an interesting mystery for a while LUL

[2:52:23] <cherrycottontail> i don't like it, it's satan
[2:52:24] <+Ilpala> THESE KIDS ARE DOWN WITH THE DEVIL
[2:52:24] <%Puhff> Wait, is that document from the 1600's?!?!?!
[2:52:26] <+Forbidden_Karp> Could it be... Satan!?
[2:52:27] <Zaphire_Saucypants> I sure do love religious fearmongering.
[2:52:30] <Pappajimbo> Luigi boards oh no
[2:52:31] <nomolomo> you guys may have to finish this tonight tho. if you were to quit now, there'd be very little left for another stream
[2:52:32] <%JonnyFodder> That said 1971...
[2:52:35] <Zeif00> I dunno Satan seems kind of cool
[2:52:36] <%Ranryu692> @Puhff no, the 70s

[2:52:50] <teefpal> They hated Satan before it was cool

[2:56:42] <+Kevlar_Caviar> WHY ARE THEY STOPPING

[2:56:45] <%JoshManVGH> Who knew sticks where enchanted weapons
[2:56:47] <%hrbeck_> BUT WE RAN 10 YARDS!?
[2:56:49] <%skm742> I have liked the ghosts visually, but they keep giving them chase scenes, which don't work well with slow creepy vibes.
[2:56:50] <danknugglit> QUICK run 5 feet then hide behind a garbage can
[2:56:53] <$lumporr> either Run or Confront Ineffectually and then Run
[2:57:03] <Chaoko99> Is it me or is the size of this church really inconsistent and unclear?
[2:57:14] <HaroldDonchee> I think you had the option didn't you
[2:57:16] <MaybeFalco> they want you to twist and bop it while you play
[2:57:21] <$lumporr> oooohhh what a choice
[2:57:21] <jett_eyes> LEFT
[2:57:24] <%JoshManVGH> Whisper whisper whisper
[2:57:29] <$lumporr> i bet the next scene is just mirrored based on your option

[2:57:57] <%mighty_max_t> But the FOOOOG
[2:57:58] <OneThousandTomatoes> what if Angela's a ghost now
[2:58:00] <%hrbeck_> AGAIN
[2:58:03] <%JoshManVGH> It's the magic fog
[2:58:03] <DancesWitBalrog> that was litterally a 50/50 on that decision
[2:58:04] <thefranchise00> Good job Paige
[2:58:04] <hearingthenseeing> TAKE ME TO CHURCH
[2:58:04] <+SWFanatic> but walking is good for your heart

[2:58:34] <HaroldDonchee> is this like evil world where morning never comes or are they just horror movie dumb and don't want to wait
[2:58:34] <$lumporr> how about take off your jacket and keep running
[2:58:39] <HugelLewd> games like these are always fun to watch cus I'd never want to play them lmaoo
[2:58:42] <%Ranryu692> @dukenux implied but not confirmed

[3:01:23] <+CatastropheCorvid> @SoFarFetched Ah!
[3:01:24] <teefpal> They had to pad the script
[3:01:33] <+SWFanatic> @teefpal what script
[3:01:34] <ohno778> KNIFE THE BABY
[3:01:34] <%hrbeck_> more crouching
[3:01:35] <%JoshManVGH> It's that dude
[3:01:38] <%greasypete00> YOOO
[3:01:38] <%Ranryu692> I don't like how much we're talking about killing someone named Mary on the same day that we buried my great-aunt Mary LUL
[3:01:39] <%JoshManVGH> Ore angela
[3:01:43] <$lumporr> you four could probably take the ghosts honestly
[3:01:47] <twistedj3ster> phrasing
[3:01:47] <%Sadira_snack_attack> whoa...tiger
[3:01:48] <%JoshManVGH> STAB!
[3:01:48] <AMaidIndeed> Why does the old man look like Greg Proops?
[3:01:48] <+YPFrost> OLD LADY LIVES
[3:01:50] <shotgang86> its the most dangerous of them all, the black guy
[3:01:52] <%Piemen99> from sex from the ghost
[3:01:52] <jett_eyes> SHES A GHOST
[3:01:53] <ChrisPlaysThing> She looks extra crispy
[3:01:56] <nomolomo> so fun fact; if you have the gun, you can totally kill angela by accident
[3:01:58] <BoxNavy> hooray
[3:02:02] <Zaphire_Saucypants> omg he DOES look kinda like Grep Proops.
[3:02:04] <%hrbeck_> extra desaturated
[3:02:07] <teefpal> What was she screaming about
[3:02:08] <ohno778> stop being a bitch for two seconds angela
[3:02:08] <pennykettle_> Ive never seen Angela alive here
[3:02:12] <Deft_Thought> Daniel's neck was just spun around, what the fuck
[3:02:13] <dukenux> ayy she's alive
[3:02:15] <+MarkoTolstov> i don't know how Angela has become my favourite, but it must be because she's SO rude LUL
[3:02:19] <danknugglit> She walked away. And deathscreamed? for some reason
[3:02:26] <SaiyanShoto> time to start killing characters
[3:02:29] <%Sadira_snack_attack> kill all run?
[3:02:34] <%Puhff> Why does Angela look like she's been rolling in the mud?
[3:02:36] <+Kevlar_Caviar> @Zaphire_Saucypants quick come up with a whose line joke i'm too tired to think of one
[3:02:37] <teefpal> @MarkoTolstov She doesn't give a fuck, and I appreciate that in dogshit games
[3:02:38] <twistedj3ster> she lost her gwasses
[3:02:39] <@SoFarFetched> ANGELA IS NOW PAIGE
[3:02:41] <@SoFarFetched> geefBlind
[3:02:49] <%Ranryu692> @SoFarFetched brutal
[3:02:52] <hearingthenseeing> I have been half paying attention, did something cool happen yet
[3:02:52] <SaiyanShoto> Think of it this way Pat, the sooner you get them all killed the sooner you beat the game
[3:02:53] <pennykettle_> Angela can totally die in that encounter a while ago, that wasn't a fake decision
[3:02:53] <+SWFanatic> So to sum up, Ghosts are mean
[3:02:55] <dukenux> @MarkoTolstov she reached the age where you start running out of fucks
[3:02:56] <DancesWitBalrog> the squad is all here
[3:03:02] <+SWFanatic> Adam Warlock
[3:03:02] <CanadianAnimatorGuy> It's a lot more endearing when they aren't arguing about nothing
[3:03:03] <Aleate> Time to take a slow stroll
[3:03:07] <$lumporr> so what was the group reaction to that one dude beating that ghost's ass
[3:03:08] <teefpal> They're adventure game protagonists, they have to walk slowly
[3:03:11] <DancesWitBalrog> EVERYONE IS HERE
[3:03:11] <MyNameIsRasus> @hearingthenseeing there was 1 cool looking ghost
[3:03:12] <teefpal> everywhere
[3:03:12] <+CatastropheCorvid> I got here late. How's this been going?
[3:03:19] <%SveriSageAdvice> but what if the thing busts through the rotted floor boards to get you
[3:03:21] <%hrbeck_> bad
[3:03:22] <@SoFarFetched> @Ranryu692 look paige has a higher death count on her glasses at possibly 20 pairs Dead or MIA Kappa
[3:03:23] <+ReallyBigRocks> just walk to the next town over
[3:03:26] <+Vampireinarm> they have monster teleporting powers
[3:03:28] <+emperordread> A trifling ambulation would outpace those rascals
[3:03:28] <OneThousandTomatoes> in a ghost town with no outside communication?
[3:03:28] <Senselessvirus> poorly
[3:03:28] <%g0atmeal> if they split up one more time i swear
[3:03:29] <$lumporr> how come they don't all just grab a branch and get busy
[3:03:30] <+SWFanatic> Shambling Whore
[3:03:32] <VritraReiRei> Imagine that that is not Angela because the real Angela still has her glasses. Wouldnt that be an actual interesting development LUL
[3:03:32] <shotgang86> if a goddamn stick made all that damage
[3:03:37] <%Puhff> Yeah the ghosts seem to need to travel phsyically, which is baffling
[3:03:37] <+realm_forge> @peachsaliva I’m doing that right now!
[3:03:38] <kinkade_77> its SO dark
[3:03:39] <%Puhff> LUL
[3:03:43] <@SoFarFetched> SPEAR him the details
[3:03:43] <%Puhff> git rekt
[3:03:48] <shotgang86> all they need is to gang up on the monsters
[3:03:52] <+SWFanatic> wait stop don't go

[3:06:08] <+SWFanatic> BILL
[3:06:11] <$mckraven> why did the stab sound get all distorted
[3:06:13] <slix3431> FRANCIS!

[3:06:41] <DashXero> Duel 1 Let's Rock
[3:06:42] <Valentinius_Anodyne> Let's rock
[3:06:42] <neroforte177> LETS ROCK
[3:06:42] <OneThousandTomatoes> i turned off my blue light filter just to see it
[3:06:43] <%greasypete00> the reason they keep teleporting the monsters is probably because they have no way to animate them getting over the obstacles
[3:06:44] <%mighty_max_t> Duel 1, Let's ROCK
[3:06:45] <ohno778> DUAL 1 LETS ROCK
[3:06:47] <whycantipostasguest> who is zoe
[3:06:48] <teefpal> It's literally just AI Dungeon bullshit
[3:06:50] <$lumporr> they should just strap rocket boosters to all these ghosties, that would be awesome
[3:06:53] <dukenux> KQKQJ
[3:06:54] <SaiyanShoto> So can those ghost things only kill their counterparts?
[3:06:57] <DancesWitBalrog> LETSS ROCK
[3:06:58] <+Grayhammatter> what?
[3:06:59] <kinkade_77> yugioh
[3:07:02] <%waltzqueen> HEAVEN OR HELL LETS ROCK
[3:07:04] <%Estuko> PogChamp are we gonna play Yugioh
[3:07:05] <MyNameIsRasus> IS THIS AZIRELIA GODDAMNIT
[3:07:06] <danknugglit> UNO
[3:07:06] <%Ranryu692> @greasypete00 also they're probably not real
[3:07:07] <+NiktenKing> Solitarot
[3:07:10] <TheHeroAppears> those are playing cards paige
[3:07:13] <+YPFrost> we are all kings
[3:07:15] <+YPFrost> true
[3:07:15] <%g0atmeal> five kings of new londo
[3:07:15] <+Taisuru> Domon?
[3:07:16] <jett_eyes> what kinda fuckin deck is that
[3:07:16] <DashXero> Never play cards with that man!
[3:07:16] <OneThousandTomatoes> OH NO REALLY
[3:07:17] <+SWFanatic> its dumb, we get it
[3:07:17] <BoxNavy> yeah
[3:07:17] <%Puhff> You dont say Kappa
[3:07:17] <+Mekhet09> I feel like your ability to keep these characters alive is ruining the playthrough. It'd be so much more satisfying to see these characters die.
[3:07:18] <Aleate> No... no, we get it
[3:07:18] <ryderbootz> 52 card pickup aww yiiiis
[3:07:19] <Monkeyweed21> oh they're just spelling it out now
[3:07:22] <+Kevlar_Caviar> NICE CUT
[3:07:23] <BoxNavy> no :)
[3:07:24] <dukenux> gee thanks :)
[3:07:25] <%JoshManVGH> JUST spelling it out huh
[3:07:26] <stantheman_97> you're all kings
[3:07:30] <SaiyanShoto> kill them all
[3:07:31] <@SoFarFetched> "BUT YOU THREW THE GUN AWAY"-he brings up for the 20th time
[3:07:33] <MyNameIsRasus> Do they think we are braindead
[3:07:37] <DracaenaLeaf> Kappa :)
[3:07:45] <+BIumen> do they actually know the twist or is this a big guess
[3:07:46] <nomolomo> yeah this reeks of pretentious writer
[3:07:52] <+thesw1tch> wait whats the twist?
[3:07:52] <teefpal> So you guys know the twist already
[3:07:57] <DXLelouch24> sometimes i wonder if writers think people are stupid
[3:07:58] <pennykettle_> I didnt see the twist coming, to be honest. I was invested in it being something cool that I didn't think it would be shit
[3:07:59] <DXLelouch24> WERE NOW
[3:08:00] <CanadianAnimatorGuy> "No one's EVER seen the Sixth Sense!"
[3:08:01] <DXLelouch24> NOT*
[3:08:02] <ChrisPlaysThing> It's the exact same beats as Until Dawn
[3:08:03] <%Puhff> "guess"
[3:08:05] <jett_eyes> but whats the twist tho
[3:08:06] <+vaporousTippler> The twist is this game sucks.
[3:08:06] <+JonathLP> What is your guess though?
[3:08:06] <%ahomeschooldropout> what is the guess
[3:08:07] <Nekros4442> The Medan twist was decent at least
[3:08:07] <UndeadManatee> Whats there guess?
[3:08:10] <+JonathLP> I wasn't here for the beginning
[3:08:13] <teefpal> Ah well I guess we'll see!
[3:08:15] <+shootbang_exe> I wonder how they newest dark pictures game is
[3:08:18] <+SWFanatic> Ghosts hate solid buildings
[3:08:19] <+realm_forge> I’m calling it Kai Kang is the true villain
[3:08:19] <jett_eyes> @vaporousTippler yeah you right
[3:08:21] <MyNameIsRasus> I also like the Medan twist
[3:08:21] <teefpal> I hated it
[3:08:23] <+ALazo> they picked up on how the guy at the bar ignored everyone but the one person
[3:08:26] <+Forbidden_Karp> I don't remember what it was
[3:08:27] <+G_Thunders> You can’t predict the twist if you think “nah no one would do such a boring dumb twist”
[3:08:27] <$lumporr> @realm_forge kai leng?
[3:08:29] <TheHeroAppears> @shootbang_exe really good
[3:08:31] <+realm_forge> Lang
[3:08:31] <%Puhff> What was the Man of Medan twist?
[3:08:32] <+Kevlar_Caviar> @shootbang_exe apparently it's actually pretty alright
[3:08:33] <OneThousandTomatoes> what if it's actually a different twist though
[3:08:35] <artoflec> it was all poison gas is a really lame ass twist i dunno LUL
[3:08:37] <+faytthepally> @UndeadManatee 7th sense ending, they're already dead
[3:08:38] <teefpal> the gas was kai leng teir bad writing
[3:08:41] <studleydoorite> Medan tells you what it is in the opening sequence, it's super obvious there too
[3:08:44] <Aleate> O <- circle
[3:08:45] <ohno778> debatable
[3:08:45] <+SWFanatic> Orb = Tumothy
[3:08:46] <reginault> more of an oval realy
[3:08:48] <dukenux> Didn't Man of Medan have a Scooby Doo type of twist?
[3:08:48] <stantheman_97> i hate the "it's actually not supernatural" twists
[3:08:49] <UndeadManatee> @faytthepally ty
[3:08:51] <%JoshManVGH> @jonathlp That this is all in the bus drivers head, because trauma or guilt or something.
[3:08:52] <%g0atmeal> fireflies love doors
[3:08:54] <+JonathLP> Kai Leng is the true villain. That's why the monsters are so slow.
[3:08:59] <pennykettle_> Man of Medan twist was interesting but the entire last 2/3rds of the game took place in identical hallways for way too long
[3:09:03] <dukenux> It's a fly that's on fire. pretty dire
[3:09:03] <+realm_forge> @lumporr I have giant hands and a tiny phone
[3:09:04] <ChrisPlaysThing> It's a show that got cancelled
[3:09:05] <neroforte177> YOU WOULD NOT BELIEVE YOUR EYES
[3:09:10] <shotgang86> ooooh the priest
[3:09:12] <Heyestus> is he gonna explain what a fucking door is next?
[3:09:16] <$lumporr> @realm_forge why not giant phone and tiny hands
[3:09:17] <+SWFanatic> Hi Me
[3:09:17] <dukenux> Naw this cannaet be
[3:09:18] <%Puhff> 10000 fireflies?! :O
[3:09:23] <$mckraven> these jumpscares feel super random
[3:09:28] <+realm_forge> LUL
[3:09:33] <+CatastropheCorvid> What's the Medan twist?
[3:09:35] <$lumporr> this fuucking sucks
[3:09:35] <$cgreene64> mayrie
[3:09:39] <jett_eyes> oh... i mean AHHHHHHH
[3:09:44] <$Tredecian> my fiend whose wife i killed?
[3:09:45] <ohno778> KILL THE BABY
[3:09:45] <%g0atmeal> hey sorry about your wife, help me please
[3:09:48] <nomolomo> men of medan worked because besides the gas, there were also pirates, who were a very real threat among the hallucinations
[3:09:48] <%JoshManVGH> MairRee
[3:09:55] <nomolomo> meanwhile this game has NOTHING
[3:09:58] <+SWFanatic> Is this a bloodborne cross promotion?
[3:09:59] <danknugglit> Kids LOVE murder
[3:10:01] <%Sadira_snack_attack> kill her
[3:10:03] <$lumporr> "too laahte. she's right here"
[3:10:09] <pennykettle_> @CatastropheCorvid ship was carrying some crazy gas that made you go crazy. made you see other people as monsters
[3:10:10] <ChrisPlaysThing> "Stab the kid"
[3:10:11] <+allups> `he looks young and old
[3:10:11] <stantheman_97> mare ree
[3:10:12] <shotgang86> "dont kill my next wife!"
[3:10:14] <MyNameIsRasus> He wants to kill her because she knows of his pedo shit
[3:10:15] <%JoshManVGH> This strange alien tongue they are speaking
[3:10:16] <@SoFarFetched> SNITCH ON HER
[3:10:18] <+CatastropheCorvid> @pennykettle_ Neat!
[3:10:20] <Darkfire346> Maaaahhhhraaaay
[3:10:20] <teefpal> he JUST said that
[3:10:27] <+faytthepally> Woo! Execute the children!
[3:10:27] <+bread_assassin> Fuck dem kids
[3:10:29] <shotgang86> stab and style on the child
[3:10:31] <+MightyDuckShoes> This acting.
[3:10:33] <cherrycottontail> I am a robot
[3:10:37] <$lumporr> "she looked super hype when i pushed her sister into a tiger pit"
[3:10:38] <%GarbageNirvana> What about kill the priest
[3:10:39] <Maleicus> yeah kill the kid
[3:10:40] <cherrycottontail> Mary seems full of remorse
[3:10:41] <%Ranryu692> omg I forgot they were standing there and got scared LUL
[3:10:41] <jett_eyes> purify child
[3:10:41] <+SWFanatic> so when we roasting marshmellows
[3:10:44] <ape_hawk> pat, child-murder is your go-to solution for everything
[3:10:49] <pennykettle_> @CatastropheCorvid it worked well for multiplayer because both players would encounter eachother and see monsters but not realize they met up
[3:10:51] <$mckraven> They're both trying so hard to have their accents that there's literally 0 emotion happening
[3:10:53] <Darkfire346> Coonjurd
[3:10:55] <dukenux> wait how did he notice them just nowe
[3:11:02] <$lumporr> why are all of these people balls out crazy
[3:11:02] <DashXero> "Actually, no. We were gonna tell you to shank her ass."
[3:11:04] <%Keyd00d> behold my demons
[3:11:08] <+CatastropheCorvid> @pennykettle_ Oh that's cool.
[3:11:10] <HaroldDonchee> that voice coming out of him is kinda goofy
[3:11:10] <+Mekhet09> I think I hate this game.
[3:11:20] <Darkfire346> his lips show more emotion trying to recreate a scottish accent
[3:11:22] <+Taisuru> ??????????????
[3:11:26] <@SoFarFetched> BUT YO WANTED TO SNITCH
[3:11:26] <dukenux> ^
[3:11:26] <+Grayhammatter> ?????
[3:11:28] <teefpal> ???
[3:11:28] <%Ranryu692> yeah, that's why he's doubting himself now
[3:11:28] <jett_eyes> wait, isn't this the past?
[3:11:29] <Nordguy> troughma
[3:11:32] <OneThousandTomatoes> i feel like I wouldn't recognize if someone else looked like me, i barely know what I look like
[3:11:37] <Aleate> "She sent you to tell me not to do it" "No, she sent you to trick me into telling!"
[3:11:39] <+Grayhammatter> what the fuck is this bullshit?
[3:11:41] <WeepProphet> shut up devil
[3:11:41] <%Ranryu692> he thinks Mary wants him to do it so that she can turn it on him or something
[3:11:41] <%g0atmeal> mary summoned you to snitch on mary
[3:11:43] <+tempestzephyr> this is dumb
[3:11:43] <%JoshManVGH> Is Andrew the only one who's spoken directly with his double?
[3:11:44] <Zeif00> I am confusion
[3:11:46] <dukenux> He's trying so hard to keep up the accent, he just speaks in monotone
[3:11:49] <Darkfire346> Paige, kill the woman!
[3:11:49] <Dr_Mooose> fuck them kids
[3:11:50] <%cobalt_phoenix_> DO IT
[3:11:51] <%greasypete00> "im gonna tell the courts about mary" "how dare you tell me to tell the courts now i wont do it"
[3:11:55] <DashXero> Fuck this guy. He loves it, obviously.
[3:11:57] <+Sperbus> Where is Peach's glasses
[3:12:00] <$lumporr> how is this the reaction of the magical generation of your clone "oh yeah, this is the devil" and no further reaction
[3:12:02] <elevatorhazrd> elevatorhazrd subscribed at Tier 1. 
[3:12:04] <+ReallyBigRocks> yeah kill the fuckin kid
[3:12:11] <WeepProphet> gotta stab the kid god said so
[3:12:11] <HaroldDonchee> wonder what happens if you kill yourself in the past
[3:12:12] <$mckraven> @dukenux he's also dropping a whole octave
[3:12:13] <jett_eyes> CHURCH IS BAD, HOW ORIGINAL
[3:12:15] <%Piemen99> The kid cause like 3 deaths
[3:12:18] <WeepProphet> pat is right
[3:12:19] <%ItsRatman> Going against religion? In ye old times? Thats how you become the devil
[3:12:19] <neroforte177> what has the point in that conversation
[3:12:21] <$lumporr> jesus would probably doubt that
[3:12:23] <Heyestus> Yo if someonenwith my face just showed up and was like, "yeah bro go snitch on some kid" I'd  at least be weirded out.
[3:12:26] <+SWFanatic> Slow the plot down
[3:12:30] <MyNameIsRasus> THE PRIEST IS A PEDOPHILE WTF
[3:12:31] <@MelBrooksKA> I can't kill a person unless they are at least 14 years or older
[3:12:33] <+SWFanatic> Theres something about Mary
[3:12:33] <%cobalt_phoenix_> chat i left for like half an hour, did anyone die
[3:12:34] <cherrycottontail> @jett_eyes it's the one truth of the world
[3:12:39] <+faytthepally> You spoke against a priest to a colonial American?  Never a good move.
[3:12:42] <TTouchdown> Puritan church is indeed bad
[3:12:43] <Darkfire346> OH SHIT
[3:12:43] <+Grayhammatter> did he just pop into existence?
[3:12:46] <pennykettle_> @cobalt_phoenix_ no and angela came back to unlife
[3:12:47] <$lumporr> i bet it's aliums
[3:12:47] <OvaltineDream> meeeeeerie
[3:12:48] <cherrycottontail> death? taxes? nah, churge is bad.
[3:12:49] <$SiameseSneeze> If only we had the power of GUN

[3:12:52] <%Sadira_snack_attack> kill them both

[3:12:53] <shotgang86> not stab, style
[3:12:53] <ohno778> kill baby
[3:12:54] <+ALazo> pat is right kill everyone
[3:12:55] <%Ranryu692> @cobalt_phoenix_ no; in fact, Angela came back
[3:12:59] <+vaporousTippler> Sharpen the child into a point and stab the priest with her.
[3:13:01] <Darkfire346> mawwwwwrey
[3:13:01] <%cobalt_phoenix_> lmao thanks
[3:13:06] <$lumporr> punch through one and hit the other
[3:13:12] <$mckraven> @melbrookska gotta be tried as an adult by court before its ok to kill them
[3:13:15] <nomolomo> if not stab, then punch
[3:13:15] <%JoshManVGH> "So anyway, I just started blasting!"
[3:13:18] <Darkfire346> Press X to equip Child
[3:13:19] <+ReallyBigRocks> what
[3:13:19] <$lumporr> @vaporousTippler this is good
[3:13:20] <%g0atmeal> social link ranked up
[3:13:25] <%Quigsies> WHAT
[3:13:25] <nomolomo> punch the child, they are small and weak
[3:13:25] <jett_eyes> So did they just change the past??????
[3:13:28] <pennykettle_> Okay for what it is worth, this part seems very different from what happens if they all die. Ive never seen anyone survive
[3:13:31] <@SoFarFetched> we're missing the other dialogue I bet
[3:13:32] <+SWFanatic> Get that D
[3:13:32] <Zaphire_Saucypants> Ugh.

[3:20:53] <dukenux> MORE WEIGHT
[3:20:54] <vVAstrAVv> i dont mean that in a backseaty way you guys just dont seem to like it much
[3:20:54] <+JonathLP> Like a fucking badass
[3:20:55] <pennykettle_> Giles is a real person @PeachSaliva not just a character
[3:20:57] <stantheman_97> dude is a badass
[3:20:58] <+thesw1tch> he was a real person. More weight!

[3:21:04] <+bread_assassin> Such an odd way t o execute someone.
[3:21:05] <%waltzqueen> MORE WEIGHT
[3:21:05] <stantheman_97> also he was real
[3:21:09] <pennykettle_> he did
[3:21:11] <slix3431> He did
[3:21:11] <%greasypete00> supposedly he did
[3:21:11] <+Grave_Titan_D> based on a real dude
[3:21:12] <%ItsRatman> He did IIRC
[3:21:12] <hearingthenseeing> "just fuck me up"
[3:21:12] <+JonathLP> By not confessing his family got to keep everything
[3:21:15] <+thesw1tch> he did
[3:21:16] <studleydoorite> Giles Corey in smash??
[3:21:17] <stantheman_97> he did
[3:21:22] <%Keyd00d> MORE WEIGHT
[3:21:23] <+realm_forge> He was George Washington’s tooth butler
[3:21:25] <$rdark_ksu> He said more weight so his family could still inherit the land. Baddass to the very end!
[3:21:27] <OneThousandTomatoes> probably a masochist
[3:21:29] <Darkfire346> He went out with the largest chest muscles known to man
[3:21:47] <pennykettle_> I was just reading about the trials because of this stream. If you snitched on others you usually lived, but if you said "fuck you im innocent" you were killed
[3:21:50] <+NiktenKing> @studleydoorite he already is in smash... rock smash
[3:21:51] <@SoFarFetched> the flashlight started working abit better once you got near objects LUL wonder if it chose to brighten it noce you got close
[3:21:52] <+Kevlar_Caviar> JOE BIDEN???

[3:21:55] <%doomunderthestairs> boat controls
[3:21:58] <%cobalt_phoenix_> i feel like this game is falling apart quickly
[3:21:59] <+cubbywolf> eeeeeeeeevil
[3:21:59] <dukenux> He only died when the stones outweighted his balls
[3:21:59] <Zaphire_Saucypants> his descendant
[3:22:05] <$mckraven> I guess the idea of creating an until gone game every year was not the best idea for quality control
[3:22:08] <+ReallyBigRocks> the debul :O
[3:22:10] <KaitlynnHere> @pennykettle_ yup, pretty much
[3:22:13] <+RaziWraith> and bad numbers on his head! monkaS
[3:22:13] <bob900000> is that the ceo of blizzard?
[3:22:14] <pennykettle_> A lot of the names you were reading on the tourist plaques were real names from the trials
[3:22:16] <%weapon000> carver is down with the devil
[3:22:26] <dukenux> da debil D:

[3:22:51] <+cubbywolf> look out there's a spooky
[3:22:53] <%Saadi90> Old man is racist.
[3:22:54] <ape_hawk> because dudes talking to other dudes about their problems are gaaaaaaaay
[3:22:55] <%Estuko> because' he's a stinky man
[3:22:58] <%JoshManVGH> Insanely ripped Gilre Corey, what say you?
[3:23:02] <Darkfire346> the jooodge
[3:23:09] <+Taisuru> I am filled with Metroid Dread
[3:23:14] <dukenux> Kids love the Devil
[3:23:15] <$lumporr> INCLUDING YOU IDIOT
[3:23:23] <+RaziWraith> That voice does not sound right with that guy LUL
[3:23:24] <slix3431> Is the judge asian?
[3:23:26] <leaplearning> judge dread
[3:23:31] <Zaphire_Saucypants> hello asian man
[3:23:33] <teefpal> Giles Corey wife was sadly hanged a few days after he was crushed :|
[3:23:35] <%greasypete00> why would there be an asian guy in a british colony settlement
[3:23:37] <$lumporr> maybe stop killing people
[3:23:39] <DashXero> Would that have been allowed back then?
[3:23:40] <pennykettle_> Allegedly it took Giles 2 days to die with the rock crushing
[3:23:40] <Sitromxe> An east asian pilgrim?
[3:23:41] <VritraReiRei> wait the Judge is Asian? thats considered realistic? LUL
[3:23:43] <+TungstenViper> Asian judge... in the 1700s?
[3:23:43] <%weapon000> So Vince is the caretaker of the ghost town and He's like I better follow this crazy white guy.
[3:23:45] <+cvp5127> ?
[3:23:46] <+faytthepally> @CanadianAnimatorGuy Vince keeps ignoring him (probably because he's dead)
[3:23:49] <OneThousandTomatoes> why is there an asain man in Massachusetts?
[3:23:50] <$KnivesEve> asian pilgrim huh
[3:23:53] <$DEETRz> merwin?
[3:24:01] <HaroldDonchee> have to be inclusive guys lol
[3:24:02] <%greasypete00> its like the 1680s-90s
[3:24:03] <+bread_assassin> Don't worry about it guys.
[3:24:03] <pennykettle_> He's asian because hes not real, hes the guy from the intro of the game
[3:24:09] <stantheman_97> wait why is the pilgrim puritan asian
[3:24:11] <teefpal> Dont worry about it
[3:24:12] <%Garthunox> oh great we missed josephs death
[3:24:16] <%Keyd00d> shut up tho
[3:24:17] <+Rofiarf> yeah, hes the guy that witnessed the fire
[3:24:19] <$cgreene64> The asian guy is another double
[3:24:22] <%Saadi90> Very progressive
[3:24:22] <slix3431> Is he supposed to be an imposter involved with the EVIL?
[3:24:22] <Nekros4442> For people who werent here. The Asian guy was the same guy we saw walk up to Andrew/70's MC when the house burned down
[3:24:25] <%JoshManVGH> Asian man got shipped from Europe? Seems plausible.
[3:24:29] <+cubbywolf> not creepy at all
[3:24:31] <%cobalt_phoenix_> NOOOOOOOOOO
[3:24:31] <MyNameIsRasus> PEDO EVIL MAN
[3:24:32] <%greasypete00> pedo priest wants a private child
[3:24:36] <+NiktenKing> CREEPO
[3:24:37] <Sitromxe> @cgreene64 Oh who? I don't remember.
[3:24:37] <+JonathLP> STRONG PEDO VIBES
[3:24:39] <dukenux> it's not likely, but honestly, who cares
[3:24:41] <+JonathLP> VERY STRONG PEDO VIBES
[3:24:43] <mr_saturday93> We're there Asians in 1700s?
[3:24:43] <+cubbywolf> not like this guy has enough power over her already
[3:24:44] <dukenux> who cares at this point
[3:24:48] <+Kevlar_Caviar> @Nekros4442 so they reused his model then lmao
[3:24:48] <mr_saturday93> in America I mean
[3:24:50] <Mister_McDerp> giving a child to a priest monkaS
[3:24:52] <Nekros4442> @Sitromxe Asian guy who walked up to the MC after the house burned down at the start
[3:24:55] <%cobalt_phoenix_> YES
[3:24:56] <dukenux> @mr_saturday93
[3:24:57] <Darkfire346> well yeh
[3:24:57] <jett_eyes> Why does everything need to be decided by trial
[3:25:00] <ape_hawk> all kids are evil
[3:25:01] <+cubbywolf> hell yeah
[3:25:03] <theshillman> EVIL CHILD
[3:25:03] <$lumporr> why are you talking to these people, don't you think they're the devil
[3:25:03] <teefpal> @mr_saturday93 Nah they werent invented until the 60s
[3:25:03] <stantheman_97> yeah
[3:25:04] <%g0atmeal> "yes" or "this is tough huh"
[3:25:05] <+ALazo> Have you met children?
[3:25:10] <DancesWitBalrog> did all of this happen kuz the Reverand is a creppy pedo?
[3:25:10] <%greasypete00> ok bye then
[3:25:11] <dukenux> @mr_saturday93 possibly, but among british puritans?
[3:25:12] <+cubbywolf> kids are human essence in small form and humans suuuuck
[3:25:13] <+emperordread> Who ever heard of a messed up kid? Poppycock!
[3:25:13] <+faytthepally> @Mister_McDerp It's a girl, she's safe.
[3:25:14] <pennykettle_> @Kevlar_Caviar technically, but all the flashback people are meant to mirror the role of another event
[3:25:14] <@SoFarFetched> remember when he was angry earlier of NOT pointing at the kid
[3:25:15] <%Saadi90> All children are evil
[3:25:17] <+tempestzephyr> BUT
[3:25:17] <%Piemen99> kill the child
[3:25:18] <$lumporr> HE JUST WALKED AWAY?
[3:25:18] <dukenux> BOI
[3:25:22] <Darkfire346> The Catalyst from ME3, anyone? Evil child!
[3:25:23] <CanadianAnimatorGuy> "Mary is sus"

[3:25:25] <ohno778> kill baby
[3:25:28] <nomolomo> literally 'thats rough buddy' as an answer
[3:25:36] <+cubbywolf> boii
[3:25:43] <OneThousandTomatoes> @mr_saturday93 maybe a few, but definitely not on the east coast and probably not in positions of power
[3:25:46] <%JoshManVGH> Where the courts always one person in these small towns?
[3:25:48] <%g0atmeal> ok so he snitches regardless of your choices
[3:25:48] <dukenux> Oh the apparitions stole her innocense?
[3:25:51] <+Mekhet09> Doesn't this historical inaccuracy just mean that we know it's not real.
[3:25:56] <pennykettle_> monkaS
[3:25:59] <lethallylactic> Yes, idiot
[3:26:00] <+G_Thunders> Omfg people disputing the historical accuracy of psychic visions of ghosts... that’s not even really happening
[3:26:01] <Dr_Mooose> I mean
[3:26:02] <+pleblu> No one said that asshole
[3:26:02] <+cubbywolf> yeah you a bitch
[3:26:04] <$lumporr> I KNOW ALL CHILD'S MINDS! HOW DARE YOU!
[3:26:06] <+faytthepally> YES, DUMB DUMB
[3:26:07] <+cubbywolf> he hasent said anything
[3:26:08] <%greasypete00> youre on thin ice bro youre asian in a pioneer settlement
[3:26:09] <Heyestus> There certainly were asian immigrants/colonists in the 1700s America, though one having an english Yorkshire accent is very implausible
[3:26:10] <+cubbywolf> hasn't
[3:26:13] <+cubbywolf> LUL
[3:26:13] <lethallylactic> The judge is sus
[3:26:15] <Zaphire_Saucypants> corrupt
[3:26:17] <%cobalt_phoenix_> NotLikeThis
[3:26:21] <ohno778> you have to kill the baby yourself
[3:26:21] <thefranchise00> that escalated so quickly
[3:26:26] <pennykettle_> @JoshManVGH I was just reading about it, apparently it was often just a few judges, no jury or anything
[3:26:27] <reginault> that animation
[3:26:27] <neroforte177> "lets listen to them" "i dont wanna hear it"
[3:26:30] <+cubbywolf> good job boi you did nothing and made everything worse
[3:26:34] <mr_saturday93> That outfit looks like a baby's bip
[3:26:36] <theshillman> what in the god damn
[3:26:38] <+TungstenViper> SPLENDID animation
[3:26:39] <shotgang86> judge is the black guy double?!?!?!
[3:26:43] <+cubbywolf> judge plays hard ball with everyone
[3:26:43] <%JoshManVGH> Whelp, off to murder the priest I guess
[3:26:51] <teefpal> @Heyestus That's actually true, but they *were* extremely rare.
[3:26:51] <+ReallyBigRocks> very bad shit
[3:26:54] <Dr_Bearington_The_Second> ah yes the time knife
[3:27:03] <$NitronStreams> they mentioned it
[3:27:06] <shotgang86> Oh neat a time knife
[3:27:11] <Nekros4442> We skipped an execution?
[3:27:13] <TheHeroAppears> time to give up and start saying nothing
[3:27:15] <critiquequartz> Is it just me or did not enough happen in that scene to make that judge pissed?
[3:27:21] <shotgang86> Oh neat a time knife!
[3:27:21] <comicalmond> dio knife?
[3:27:32] <jett_eyes> YOU ARE LITERALLY TALKING TO YOUR DOUBLE
[3:27:34] <%Ranryu692> Would that this hoodie were a time hoodie
[3:27:35] <+realm_forge> Somehow Emperor Palpatine has returned
[3:27:36] <Darkfire346> awww shit, sumbody gun DIE tonight
[3:27:37] <%JoshManVGH> Aaaaah, change the past
[3:27:39] <+ReallyBigRocks> all that means is that this also already happened and you have no free will
[3:27:43] <OneThousandTomatoes> what if its all based on a story andrew was writing, hense the creative writing teacher or some bullshit like that idk
[3:27:45] <+xcompleasedad> @critiquequartz Gaem is da bayd
[3:27:45] <dukenux> It's scary noise
[3:27:47] <CanadianAnimatorGuy> @realm_forge LUL
[3:27:47] <dukenux> very spooky
[3:27:53] <pennykettle_> @PeachSaliva Did you guys watch The Witch? very good movie

[3:28:08] <dukenux> oh my gooood
[3:28:12] <$NitronStreams> Look at those goobers
[3:28:15] <scrumbotime> I like the clearly digital black man
[3:28:16] <jett_eyes> there are so many damn contradictions in this plot
[3:28:18] <%g0atmeal> shining reference #4
[3:28:22] <%AncelDeLambert> you guys are still going?
[3:28:33] <%JoshManVGH> And he was at the funeral
[3:28:34] <DashXero> In the 70's? Wow. That must have been tough.
[3:28:35] <Monkeyweed21> thats why Tanya's grave had flowers
[3:28:44] <teefpal> What if the twist is that its time travel and all the characters are the same person at different points in time, ala All You Zombies?
[3:28:47] <$cgreene64> Just because there's one Black guy doesn't mean they're the same guy Pat

[3:30:00] <Deft_Thought> More mircocuts
[3:30:03] <$cgreene64> ancient?
[3:30:06] <$lumporr> the truth is, you're all in the past and just hallucinating the future
[3:30:07] <+CaptainJax> "we went to the 1600's but this is a fuckin weird picture yo"
[3:30:08] <$RealThiele> without the intro this would be a better story
[3:30:12] <%JoshManVGH> Dutch angle starting...
[3:30:17] <+NiktenKing> That was his best line read so far
[3:30:19] <jett_eyes> You know, what if YOU guys are the weird ones
[3:30:22] <OvaltineDream> WHAT
[3:30:25] <Zaphire_Saucypants> man these characters sure do love to say "no clue" and "I dunno"
[3:30:30] <teefpal> Reincarnation?
[3:30:31] <Chaoko99> HOW DID THAT BREAK WITH SO LITTLE FORCE
[3:30:47] <thefranchise00> the glass went nutzz
[3:30:51] <%hrbeck_> Oh no, the Catgitl gas!
[3:30:52] <+silvery_cricket> Why does the 70's act like 1600's America?
[3:30:52] <$lumporr> @CaptainJax this picture reminds me of getting grabbed by that tongue monster, only it's more intense
[3:30:53] <cherrycottontail> @Chaoko99 ITS OLD
[3:30:53] <DancesWitBalrog> andrew is the safest among the group, right?
[3:30:54] <Darkfire346> some P.T. shit here
[3:30:58] <pennykettle_> what is a "family of the year"
[3:30:59] <shotgang86> look at this photograph
[3:31:01] <MyNameIsRasus> TIME IS CONVOLUTED IN LITTLE HOPE
[3:31:05] <%vehementvadr> and then the CUM DEVIL came for them
[3:31:07] <+shabop> time is fucked up in lordran
[3:31:17] <%Ranryu692> the way Paige plays this game makes it seem like it has Heavy Rain controls
[3:31:20] <+silvery_cricket> Also the 70's wasnt actually that long ago, a bunch of these people would probably still be alive
[3:31:25] <pennykettle_> LUL
[3:31:29] <%greasypete00> it just clicked for me
[3:31:30] <+JonathLP> LOL
[3:31:33] <olm46> They could only afford one
[3:31:35] <+ArmoredDeath> majinoBHM
[3:31:40] <+silvery_cricket> like someone in their 20s back in the 70's would probably still be alive
[3:31:41] <jett_eyes> Tanya and Vince
[3:31:41] <Heyestus> it do be like that
[3:31:42] <ChrisPlaysThing> The semen demon @vehementvadr
[3:31:43] <lethallylactic> The game's black person LUL
[3:31:45] <teefpal> Yeah the twist is annoying
[3:31:45] <Darkfire346> so hes basically Shaft?
[3:31:46] <$lumporr> hey at least they filled their quota
[3:31:48] <stantheman_97> the designated black man
[3:31:49] <bob900000> LUL
[3:31:50] <+CaptainJax> budget for one black guy
[3:31:50] <p3niletrauma> Why are you at Pat's house
[3:31:52] <%greasypete00> they tried to get woolie but he was too busy with the kites
[3:31:52] <SGrim> @silvery_cricket The 70's were 50 years ago
[3:31:55] <$mckraven> in the beginning they just called him "that guy"
[3:32:15] <Zaphire_Saucypants> Another Wymen
[3:32:17] <%valcheese> valcheese subscribed at Tier 2. They've subscribed for 12 months, currently on a 12 month streak! Yeh! One year sub baby!! Ready for spooky games and spookier candy
[3:32:19] <%mighty_max_t> Alright, I gotta squeeze in a quick nap before work. Hope you enjoy(?) the rest of the game
[3:32:23] <+NiktenKing> Little
[3:32:26] <%g0atmeal> VVyman
[3:32:30] <NeonBleu> squint harder
[3:32:35] <%greasypete00> thos
[3:32:40] <+SWFanatic> Paige used SQUINT its super effective
[3:32:44] <Darkfire346> i thought that said Thot Wyman....
[3:32:47] <MaybeFalco> 300 year piece of paper almost untouched by time btw
[3:32:50] <Zaphire_Saucypants> Why does he look so asian tho?
[3:32:51] <$lumporr> @NeonBleu she's actually closing her eyes and *feeling* the text
[3:32:51] <teefpal> I like how they're throwing out all this shit to confuse people so they dont guess the twist.
[3:32:53] <+CaptainJax> what kinda name is saml
[3:32:58] <+FattimusSlime> “Lieutenant Hope”
[3:33:04] <%Ranryu692> I thought that said Thomas Wayne
[3:33:08] <Monkeyweed21> @Zaphire_Saucypants good question, no answer
[3:33:11] <Maleicus> majn that judge sure is dumb
[3:33:12] <teefpal> That looked like a Poptart for a seond
[3:33:17] <+Grayhammatter> lieutenant hope
[3:33:19] <studleydoorite> he later regretted being so stupid
[3:33:20] <MrATheGreat> Lmao "WHY DID I LISTEN TO THIS DUMB KID"
[3:33:22] <+NiktenKing> So we have the answer
[3:33:24] <+ReallyBigRocks> he was like "lol oops"
[3:33:24] <$RealThiele> Thomas was a dumb bitch
[3:33:27] <+NiktenKing> OKAY
[3:33:28] <%waltzqueen> @teefpal which flavor though
[3:33:28] <@SoFarFetched> I mean he was literally like "DO YOU THINK IM STUPID!?!?" to the past  guy.
[3:33:38] <teefpal> @teefpal mint chocolate
[3:33:40] <%vVAstrAVv> vVAstrAVv subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 2 months! after pat read my message about wall hugging i thought "damn that sounded bossy" i just meant it like maybe youd want to end it sooner if you were wanting to. gave me a reason to sub for once tho so thanks for the streams <3
[3:33:41] <olm46> They were super inclusive
[3:33:42] <MrATheGreat> RIGHT?
[3:33:43] <lethallylactic> LUL
[3:33:45] <%Bluwizard21> but diversity
[3:33:46] <+CaptainJax> LUL
[3:33:48] <bob900000> LUL
[3:33:48] <BaeSoora> i was wondering whats up with the Asian lmao
[3:33:49] <Dr_Mooose> sounds legit
[3:33:49] <$RealThiele> divers LUL
[3:33:51] <BaeSoora> no racism but wtf
[3:33:54] <dukenux> English puritans - very inclusive folk
[3:34:00] <%Bluwizard21> just like vikings were primarily black with red hair
[3:34:02] <$SiameseSneeze> Say what you will about the witch hunts, but they were super progressive Kappa
[3:34:02] <jett_eyes> hall wuggin
[3:34:02] <+CaptainJax> Korean food was real big in 1600s Salem
[3:34:03] <+Mekhet09> They didn't even have asians in america until like 1880s.
[3:34:05] <+emperordread> Deadwood taught me that they would have been called "celestials"
[3:34:05] <DancesWitBalrog> they cared abt diversity, pat
[3:34:06] <teefpal> So inclusive they left Holland because they hated being around other faiths!
[3:34:10] <stantheman_97> the very well known progressive puritans
[3:34:11] <Sitromxe> The Puritans were widely known to be a highly progressive faction.
[3:34:18] <bob900000> they were a progressive group of pilgrims
[3:34:20] <%cobalt_phoenix_> @BaeSoora not to be racist, but asian peopl- BWAAAAGH
[3:34:22] <%JoshManVGH> 15th century puritans, the most inclusive of white folks!
[3:34:22] <sun312772> their game games are getting repetitive
[3:34:28] <HaroldDonchee> so they're not real doubles then?
[3:34:33] <pennykettle_> 1893 feels too recent
[3:34:37] <dukenux> @emperordread that sounds weirdly noble for a racial slur
[3:34:38] <teefpal> Puritans being described as progressives is hiliarous
[3:34:41] <Monkeyweed21> 1893?
[3:34:43] <$RealThiele> oriental demon
[3:34:44] <$lumporr> "he's the debil!"
[3:34:47] <dukenux> LUL
[3:34:47] <%Ranryu692> nice George Carlin joke
[3:34:48] <cherrycottontail> 1693
[3:34:50] <+Grayhammatter> LUL
[3:34:52] <%BinaryFireball> its almost like they're giving it away intentionally now
[3:34:54] <shotgang86> DOPE?
[3:34:54] <BoxNavy> fuck you england
[3:34:55] <teefpal> And Holland!
[3:34:56] <$SiameseSneeze> yeah fuck England
[3:34:58] <%Bluwizard21> they got kicked out of denmark
[3:35:00] <AMajorTom> They came here for freedom!
[3:35:02] <+emperordread> @dukenux I know right? I thought it sounded cool
[3:35:04] <+silvery_cricket> Even if they didn't kill him, there is zero chance he would have a position of authority.
[3:35:04] <DancesWitBalrog> PURITANS WERE A CULT
[3:35:05] <+ReallyBigRocks> DOPE?
[3:35:07] <ohno778> Maybe england was in the right actually
[3:35:08] <+Mekhet09> They left holland before going to america because it was too disgustingly open.
[3:35:08] <Ipsenscastle> I'm English, can confirm sucks
[3:35:10] <MrATheGreat> got kicked out of WHITE CENTRAL
[3:35:10] <AMajorTom> The freedom to opress
[3:35:14] <+Mekhet09> FUCKING HOLLAND.
[3:35:14] <Mister_McDerp> and the netherlands too
[3:35:15] <+cvp5127> breaking za law
[3:35:16] <laserbeaming> Breakin ze world
[3:35:16] <Essixian> Less kicked out and more "You won't let us make Christmas and dancing illegal so we're outta here"
[3:35:17] <Zaphire_Saucypants> Every religion is a cult
[3:35:18] <+Grayhammatter> Dope
[3:35:19] <+Mekhet09> THEY WERE ASSHOLLS.
[3:35:20] <+MightyDuckShoes> It's an anachronism that shows the story's hand as this has to be false or the people are placeholders for the actual people from the past.
[3:35:21] <Sitromxe> Then got tweaked out on paranoia and murdered a bunch of their own people for no reason.
[3:35:21] <dukenux> The guys for whom the Irish were too much diversity
[3:35:23] <pennykettle_> yo eat my fucking cereal and dont masturbate
[3:35:25] <$mckraven> @amajortom freedom to persecute anyone who believed different
[3:35:26] <+silvery_cricket> OH GOD DID THEY EAT BREAD AT THE START OF THE GAME, AND THIS IS ALL JUST A BREAD MOLD HALLUCINATION!!!
[3:35:29] <Zaphire_Saucypants> Religions are just more widely accepted cults
[3:35:36] <+CaptainJax> Pat putting the fucking pilgrims on blast
[3:35:39] <+realm_forge> They were then and still are
[3:35:42] <+G_Thunders> The game doesn’t reward the player at all for figuring the twist out early, so I don’t think the game’s giving it away on purpose
[3:35:43] <slix3431> Puritans hate everyone.
[3:35:43] <DancesWitBalrog> true, religion is a joke. Monsoon taught me that
[3:35:44] <Monkeyweed21> no they got kicked out because they were protestants and the king was down with the church at the time
[3:35:46] <AMajorTom> @mckraven Exactly
[3:35:46] <%JoshManVGH> It was also the poors the drunks, the political discenters. England shipped anyone they didn't like, anywhere else.
[3:35:47] <Maids4lyfe> Kellogg was obsessed with masturbation
[3:35:51] <stantheman_97> too puritanical for a religious europe
[3:35:52] <teefpal> Truth
[3:35:55] <+ReallyBigRocks> start pushin on doors
[3:35:58] <+CaptainJax> why not walk out the door
[3:36:05] <jett_eyes> It's gonna zoom out of a novel at the end and be like "And that's the end of the story"
[3:36:08] <scrumbotime> of course he can't push it by himself, he's not real
[3:36:09] <+silvery_cricket> Anyone who was here at the start of the stream did they the game begin with them eating something wheat based?
[3:36:12] <BoxNavy> help me oot
[3:36:13] <teefpal> USA was Australia 1.0
[3:36:15] <%Bluwizard21> oh yall are almost done i do believe
[3:36:16] <@SoFarFetched> Wait heres something I realized, if the twist is "we've been dead the whole time" whats the worry over making sure they're alive still if they're already dead? geefThink
[3:36:18] <Parapattern> What is this going to do?
[3:36:19] <DashXero> Why hasn't he passed out from blood loss yet?
[3:36:19] <+SWFanatic> hes moving that shoulder pretty well for something who was stabbed with an iron spike
[3:36:21] <+CaptainJax> push box
[3:36:22] <+silvery_cricket> because if this is a bread mold hallucination I will be pissed
[3:36:25] <+Taisuru> So gameplay can occur
[3:36:25] <%Estuko> Is he a secret Canadian
[3:36:26] <$RealThiele> to make a tonn of noise
[3:36:28] <+ReallyBigRocks> amazing
[3:36:29] <+realm_forge> Today we call them evangelicals
[3:36:30] <NeonBleu> THATS WHY
[3:36:30] <Zaphire_Saucypants> Yeah keep going Pat n Paige. You're nearly done.
[3:36:31] <+CaptainJax> so there can be a jumpscare
[3:36:31] <BoxNavy> why not :)
[3:36:32] <%JoshManVGH> So the idea that the best and brightest came to NA to settle the new world, is a wild fabrication.
[3:36:33] <%cobalt_phoenix_> HOW
[3:36:35] <Monkeyweed21> WHAT WAS THAT CAMERA CUT
[3:36:36] <MaybeFalco> because the game said they cant climb over shit
[3:36:38] <theshillman> what
[3:36:38] <+ReallyBigRocks> oh sick
[3:36:38] <Zaphire_Saucypants> You gettin into the finale
[3:36:39] <$Tredecian> so he could fall into a drama hle
[3:36:39] <Sitromxe> Try to make sense of that series of events I dare you.
[3:36:40] <$mckraven> so he could fall in the hole
[3:36:40] <CatRidder> so the plot could happen
[3:36:41] <TheHeroAppears> so the monster could show up
[3:36:41] <ohno778> stop falling daniel fuck
[3:36:44] <%ItsRatman> How did he fall in? The boix was in front of him?
[3:36:44] <$cgreene64> how did he fall in the hole
[3:36:46] <Aydarkzero> uhoh
[3:36:52] <MrATheGreat> What would be worse, the possible ending where the puritans aren't racist or the other possible ending where witches are real and the Salem Hunt was justified?
[3:36:52] <%greasypete00> just jump down onto the dpikeman
[3:36:53] <owazowski> !uptime
[3:36:54] <MrATheGreat> ATATCK
[3:36:55] <Srthunda> they looking at him getting murdered like prime time tv
[3:36:56] <%Piemen99> what happened to the boxes in front of them?
[3:36:57] <cherrycottontail> can't they just all gang up on this guy
[3:36:58] <%g0atmeal> look at his face LUL
[3:36:59] <+Grayhammatter> why...
[3:37:02] <jett_eyes> theres 5 of you and 1 of him, just gang tackle him
[3:37:05] <OneThousandTomatoes> attack
[3:37:06] <+G_Thunders> Cause Andrew’s mind goblins wanted to create this dramatic moment
[3:37:07] <NireFuster> Just jump down and help him like damn
[3:37:11] <%Estuko> If you think about it, two guys could take on that slow moving single striking monster
[3:37:11] <pennykettle_> ?
[3:37:14] <Ipsenscastle> this game is so much longer than its premise it able to support
[3:37:16] <teefpal> @MrATheGreat imo the second one
[3:37:20] <%JoshManVGH> @sofarfetched Probably some shadow stat tied to Andrew's mental state.
[3:37:22] <+NiktenKing> YEYEYE ACTUALLY FIGHT IT
[3:37:22] <%greasypete00> what the fuck is going on
[3:37:24] <Dr_Mooose> anybody gonna help?

[3:37:35] <%greasypete00> WHAT???
[3:37:35] <Heyestus> I really like that in all of the investigation segments, whenever you need to call someone else over they're ALWAYS staring off onto space like a 4 year old who's  out shopping with their parents
[3:37:36] <$lumporr> THAT'S CRAZY

[3:37:55] <%Keyd00d> butterfinges
[3:37:55] <OneThousandTomatoes> i don't understand what's happening
[3:37:56] <+Grayhammatter> PAIGE!
[3:37:56] <+silvery_cricket> For anyone that was here at the start of the stream, did the main characters start the game eating some type of wheat product. As I am curious if this is gonna just be some wheat mold hallucination?
[3:37:56] <Deft_Thought> But why would he tell them to go
[3:37:56] <olm46> Dodge roll
[3:37:56] <%greasypete00> PARRY
[3:37:58] <%AncelDeLambert> swing away

[3:38:14] <%cobalt_phoenix_> THIS IS JUST DARK SOULS NOW

[3:38:38] <shotgang86> those are the bitchest ass ghosts that I have ever seen
[3:38:39] <NireFuster> They could've all jumped down and helped him
[3:38:39] <$lumporr> thanks paige
[3:38:42] <afronooch> thought the exact same thing
[3:38:42] <+ReallyBigRocks> ok so this is the same thing that happened to angela so he's probably also fine
[3:38:44] <ohno778> dmca
[3:38:45] <jett_eyes> why didn't they all just jump down and start tag teaming the fuckin monster
[3:38:47] <Maids4lyfe> @tempestzephyr no one has any facial expressions is part of it
[3:38:47] <$RealThiele> LUL john already given up

[3:44:13] <%g0atmeal> she went to the store
[3:44:16] <NireFuster> Huge and strong
[3:44:18] <Zaphire_Saucypants> in the loading screen they were
[3:44:21] <rustybuckethead21> what's that? is that the script?
[3:44:22] <VritraReiRei> in the transition scene @PeachSaliva
[3:44:24] <%SveriSageAdvice> only in the selection screen
[3:44:28] <pennykettle_> if just loading screen thats fine
[3:44:29] <@SoFarFetched> I guess for the character portrait she always has glasses
[3:44:29] <VritraReiRei> it was a joke
[3:44:31] <NireFuster> Average piss, that's good
[3:44:31] <Will_The_Soulless> Did she kill anyone yet
[3:44:37] <MrATheGreat> She lost in when she was getting tentacled
[3:44:38] <Chaoko99> what's a 10/10 piss like?
[3:44:38] <$Bt_Robot> Damn you, Paw Patrol commercial!
[3:44:39] <+SwipperSwapper> eh 6/10 forme
[3:44:41] <twistedj3ster> I had to get a refund for mine
[3:44:46] <$NitronStreams> piss out of ten
[3:44:53] <MrATheGreat> Dad stoned a witch in the past
[3:44:53] <+vaporousTippler> 7/10 isn't average, it's good. This is what's wrong with piss reviews these days.
[3:44:53] <SaiyanShoto> piss shivers out of 10
[3:44:54] <NireFuster> 10/10 piss is like when you barely reach the toilet and it *actually* feels good to pee, that's a 10/10 pee
[3:44:59] <stantheman_97> 4/10 not enough pressure
[3:45:02] <+Grayhammatter> the most evil of fences
[3:45:04] <pennykettle_> piss is better than orgasm to me
[3:45:06] <%doomunderthestairs> evil fences yeah
[3:45:06] <+BIumen> it does
[3:45:13] <teefpal> No you can be killed
[3:45:14] <%SveriSageAdvice> they can super stab you super hard
[3:45:15] <Zaphire_Saucypants> it's happened
[3:45:20] <shotgang86> how the fuck they are not armed with everything in front of them
[3:45:20] <%waltzqueen> it happen
[3:45:21] <+SWFanatic> anything you fall on
[3:45:21] <Darkfire346> you would get deaded
[3:45:23] <+Taisuru> It's pointed metal paige
[3:45:25] <Sitromxe> Depends on how hard you fall on it I'd wager.
[3:45:26] <rustybuckethead21> gravity has enough force to pirce
[3:45:26] <bob900000> you would die
[3:45:29] <Chaoko99> that's how bullets work paige.
[3:45:30] <%BinaryFireball> I remember a girl who fell from the balcony during an earthquake
[3:45:30] <Zaphire_Saucypants> momentum counts for a lot\
[3:45:31] <shotgang86> and like, when the ghosts come
[3:45:32] <%BinaryFireball> yea you die
[3:45:33] <olm46> We're more fragile than you'd think
[3:45:33] <rustybuckethead21> *pierce
[3:45:34] <+pleblu> From that height
[3:45:37] <shotgang86> beat them
[3:45:37] <%GabeSweetMan> All you need is enough force to push something through.
[3:45:40] <DashXero> That's why 2x4's become dangerous in Tornadoes.
[3:45:47] <Chaoko99> CAR?
[3:45:47] <Parapattern> I don't think you could use it as a spear hard enough to impale someone
[3:45:49] <Chaoko99> CAR
[3:45:50] <stantheman_97> being dull won't matter if you fall from high enough
[3:45:51] <+TungstenViper> narrow thing goes through tender meat
[3:45:51] <VritraReiRei> especially falling off a 3 story building, thats enough to impale you
[3:45:51] <SaiyanShoto> me crawling out of bed in the morning
[3:45:52] <Monkeyweed21> yea those  fences got banned in a lot of places for a reason
[3:45:57] <%GabeSweetMan> Also there was a guy who became paralyzed after landing on a fence because it pierced his spine.
[3:45:59] <tanarath> It doesn't have to be that sharp, although they definitely were sharp
[3:45:59] <+SWFanatic> this series loves panning to a spook in the foreground
[3:45:59] <ohno778> fuck yeah kill baby
[3:46:00] <jett_eyes> again, 5 vs 1
[3:46:02] <+Taisuru> I love when a character just immediately hard rights off screen in front of the camera
[3:46:04] <+Grayhammatter> yeah
[3:46:04] <Zaphire_Saucypants> wow, so meaningful
[3:46:06] <+grilin18> Has pat seen Fortnite news?
[3:46:06] <%Bluwizard21> people have been impaled by flat ended tree trunks
[3:46:07] <+CaptainJax> Straw in tornadoes can fucking pierce trees
[3:46:07] <@MelBrooksKA> Granted, super blunt things can just push organs away rather than pierce them
[3:46:09] <MrATheGreat> ISSA CULT
[3:46:11] <%g0atmeal> does it add to the experience when it makes you do a QTE for every hand motion?
[3:46:15] <Chaoko99> MONSTER IN THE TRUNK
[3:46:17] <OneThousandTomatoes> that was totally a "the squads all here" moment
[3:46:18] <pennykettle_> have yall seen that video of a fence landing on a guy's neck, pinning him to a garbage can? snapped his neck
[3:46:20] <Gorgs7> @peachsaliva You are a skin sack around jello, and never forget that
[3:46:21] <BoxNavy> BURN IN HELL!
[3:46:23] <$mckraven> one thing that always bothers me about these kinds of stories is why is it now that the ghosts attack but not the 70s. they got all metaphorical deaths but for some reason now they're just sending ghosts out
[3:46:29] <%ItsRatman> BURN IN HELL! Nice.

[3:56:24] <%JoshManVGH> Paige is going to have a killswitch installed in herself
[3:56:27] <+FoolsArcade> I mean... he did say he'd live forever as a toliet if he could.
[3:56:30] <ryderbootz> sigma male mindset
[3:56:31] <%Bluwizard21> @PeachSaliva That's cause he'd piss himself and run
[3:56:31] <KaitlynnHere> “I love you” “oh thanks”
[3:56:31] <MrATheGreat> Tbf if you came to help him and you died together than it would be just that
[3:56:32] <+tempestzephyr> If I shit my pants, YOU have to SHIT your pants
[3:56:33] <Zaphire_Saucypants> He'll feel bad about it after tho, so it's all good.
[3:56:33] <DXLelouch24> Paige you could totally take these weak monsters
[3:56:35] <NephiStreams> LUL remember: You said yes <3 @PeachSaliva
[3:56:37] <+KngJester> id save my spouse but i would not die for my spouse lol
[3:56:37] <SaiyanShoto> Pat would transform into a ball and roll away
[3:56:38] <DXLelouch24> hell any of us could
[3:56:38] <twistedj3ster> @CanadianAnimatorGuy Prankster doesn't affect Dark nowadays
[3:56:39] <scrumbotime> To be fair, a ghoul or ghost, pat can't do SHIT to it
[3:56:40] <DancesWitBalrog> Paige, you are stronger than Pat. how would he protect you
[3:56:41] <DXLelouch24> their pathetic
[3:56:41] <Coystick> I'd save you and you're just a kooky internet person to me
[3:56:42] <Gorgs7> he'd save Gief
[3:56:45] <VritraReiRei> "If I die before you do, I will haunt you FOREVER." 👻
[3:56:45] <shotgang86> he would then totally kill himself with regret
[3:56:47] <teefpal> Wow that's honestly shitty
[3:56:47] <NireFuster> But Paige, you're super huge and strong! You can definitely handle it and he knows it!!
[3:56:49] <%Quigsies> based
[3:56:52] <Darkfire346> Pat would powerbomb you on TOP of the monster and then run away
[3:56:53] <KaitlynnHere> Remember paige, you can still get out
[3:56:54] <DianaTheAscian> Did they here about RE being in Fortnite already?
[3:56:54] <HaroldDonchee> tbf it's probably really hard to keep you alive paige

[3:57:01] <Heyestus> understandable, really
[3:57:01] <+HiroTSK5> CAn't live forever if you're dead
[3:57:02] <OneThousandTomatoes> he would probably save gief though
[3:57:04] <SaiyanShoto> Now would he shove you to save himself?
[3:57:04] <holyxgrale> I'm sure he's just lying so when it happens it'll be a huge twist
[3:57:04] <NeonBleu> Ask if he would save Gief LUL
[3:57:05] <Coystick> BACK TO VIDEO GAMES - Pat
[3:57:05] <mr_saturday93> Paige remember if you're every running away from a monster your legs are longer and you are probably faster
[3:57:05] <MrATheGreat> If Pat was holding the door, and you came to help him, he would run away once your grip was secure on the door
[3:57:07] <ChrisPlaysThing> Nah, Pat would honestly be destroyed if you died
[3:57:08] <AMajorTom> You have to assess the probability of saving vs both of you dying
[3:57:08] <%vVAstrAVv> oh come oooonnn pat would stay for the tongue lol
[3:57:08] <+CaptainJax> cowabummer
[3:57:11] <pennykettle_> but what if I NEED to use this sledgehammer later?
[3:57:11] <KaitlynnHere> The clock is ticking!
[3:57:12] <@SoFarFetched> "OH NO! .....Anyway"
[3:57:12] <+cubbywolf> he'd throw the sledgehammer but it would fall hilariously short and he'd book it
[3:57:15] <DXLelouch24> @PeachSaliva Paige these monsters are pathetic, you could take em, hell i could take em
[3:57:16] <%Genericho> what if he needed a dick transplant
[3:57:16] <Darkfire346> what if he needed a new ass?

[3:57:17] <UnImprest> if you cant outrun Pat..... its your fault
[3:57:18] <bob900000> time to find paige no 2
[3:57:21] <@MelBrooksKA> "Time to get remarried I guess"

[3:57:32] <+cubbywolf> pasta rat
[3:57:32] <+SWFanatic> you volunteered to murder centipede
[3:57:36] <%ItsRatman> Pats the type of guy to trip Paige, so he could get away faster
[3:57:37] <NireFuster> What's this about a centipede? LUL
[3:57:38] <+pleblu> Pat would rather be a toliet
[3:57:39] <ryderbootz> should a king die for only one of his subjects?
[3:57:39] <pennykettle_> id die for A wife CoolCat
[3:57:40] <$NitronStreams> Pat would do anything for love, but he wont do that.

[3:57:44] <tanarath> Man, sure is a shame that Paige died so I could play video games. -Pat

[3:57:46] <SaiyanShoto> That chat will die for you Paige
[3:57:46] <Zeemod155> i membe
[3:57:49] <holyxgrale> Does he at least yell if there is a spider behind you?
[3:57:49] <AngryAsian5> You could probably outrun him, so he needs the headstart LUL
[3:57:50] <Maleicus> or a fool
[3:57:57] <%hrbeck_> Would you jump on a spider for him?
[3:57:57] <AMajorTom> He might not die for you, but would he kill for you?
[3:57:59] <+bluguu> let's be real Paige healthwise you don't offer much
[3:57:59] <tanarath> You should
[3:58:00] <Darkfire346> gief has a heart on his ass

[3:58:03] <%g0atmeal> poor giefy
[3:58:04] <KaitlynnHere> I’d die for you, complete stranger
[3:58:04] <+YourRedDog> Let's not forget that in 12 Minutes Pat kept cutting his wife's throat with a knife repeatedly because he thought it was the logical solution.
[3:58:06] <+cubbywolf> not zangief?
[3:58:06] <DXLelouch24> wouldnt*

[3:58:11] <$mckraven> snore
[3:58:13] <pennykettle_> I thought that was a big Pat Fart
[3:58:13] <BoxNavy> moon2BED
[3:58:14] <scrumbotime> gief will play the game now
[3:58:14] <+cubbywolf> not the young pepper?

[3:58:15] <lethallylactic> Snort
[3:58:15] <All_Salt> Is this ham sandwhich 2.0?
[3:58:16] <SGrim> But Gief has longer to live!

[3:58:20] <comicalmond> why elmo
[3:58:20] <holyxgrale> But Pat would live for you peach
[3:58:22] <Deft_Thought> psaDogchamp
[3:58:23] <tanarath> Zangief stream
[3:58:23] <DashXero> Cats swim rather well.
[3:58:24] <ohno778> he snores while awake
[3:58:27] <vonmaultke> Pats 3rd on the list LUL
[3:58:29] <+HiroTSK5> He's a block, they don't float
[3:58:29] <%GabeSweetMan> They are too solid
[3:58:29] <Darkfire346> Zangief is a fuckin rock, Paige
[3:58:32] <VritraReiRei> "as long as i dont have to sacrifice one of my animals in return" Kappa
[3:58:32] <%vVAstrAVv> paige would die for pat... and kill him for elmo lol
[3:58:32] <KaitlynnHere> That dog needs a CPAP
[3:58:33] <+ReallyBigRocks> he just needs floaties
[3:58:33] <+cubbywolf> but in that situation they are drowning because they are exhausted
[3:58:39] <DancesWitBalrog> GIEF got denisty
[3:58:40] <comicalmond> he would sink
[3:58:40] <$mckraven> most bulldogs are made of rocks
[3:58:42] <+cubbywolf> LUL
[3:58:42] <Ner234> LARGE
[3:58:42] <twistedj3ster> Fat floats
[3:58:42] <coyotezappa> Zangeif probably swims like a minivan.
[3:58:45] <%GabeSweetMan> Zangief is muscle, Pat is fluff.
[3:58:47] <%lemon_rinds> THEY NEED TO L E A R N
[3:58:48] <teefpal> spherical lads
[3:58:48] <%JoshManVGH> She's offering herself for Pat's life, not the pets for Pat's life.
[3:58:52] <scrumbotime> oh yeah, having an orb makes you into a human buoy
[3:58:53] <Coystick> Pat wouldn't swim, he's bob
[3:58:53] <+Taisuru> Gief is not a swimming bulldog no way
[3:58:54] <%g0atmeal> if you can float on your back you are basically immune to drowning
[3:58:54] <NeonBleu> yall are some round mofos
[3:58:54] <%waltzqueen> .....moves
[3:58:54] <NeroInfinite> No bulldogs can't swim
[3:58:55] <tanarath> Put Zangief on Pat
[3:58:57] <OneThousandTomatoes> the cat would dog it's nails into you
[3:58:58] <SulfurousAcid> Paige's cool swim moves kaiG
[3:58:59] <+SWFanatic> zangief can be deployed as a flotation device
[3:59:01] <ohno778> moves like sinking
[3:59:02] <KaitlynnHere> Elmo would scratch you to the point of drowning
[3:59:02] <+Rofiarf> paige will get silver medal ptsd
[3:59:04] <MrATheGreat> Pat would look great in a bkini
[3:59:05] <KaitlynnHere> Because cat
[3:59:08] <+cubbywolf> no
[3:59:11] <BoxNavy> more like fartley
[3:59:11] <KaitlynnHere> Lol
[3:59:13] <%JoshManVGH> Just walks on the lake floor
[3:59:14] <tanarath> Put Elmo on Paige, everyone either survives or dies.
[3:59:16] <+cubbywolf> Farley is okay
[3:59:18] <DianaTheAscian> Do u Paige?
[3:59:19] <Zaphire_Saucypants> You're nearly done

[3:59:37] <Zaphire_Saucypants> You guys are on the homestretch
[3:59:38] <+pleblu> Elmo light Pat not
[3:59:38] <+ghostfaceninja_> cool streamer Will Neff's dog is named Farley after the comedian
[3:59:38] <+Rofiarf> elmo is a cat, can't he swim?
[3:59:38] <@SoFarFetched> Elmo is the elder
[3:59:41] <ChrisPlaysThing> Fun fact: Chris Farley was going to be the original voice of shrek before he died
[3:59:41] <MrATheGreat> Catculating Elmo
[3:59:42] <+cubbywolf> so you let pat and xangief die for strategy
[3:59:42] <teefpal> Lets be real here, animals dont know they're gonna die
[3:59:43] <%lemon_rinds> my sister got our bulldog to fall in a pool and he just sank to the bottom
[3:59:45] <ohno778> tactical Elmo
[3:59:48] <NireFuster> Damn nice one
[3:59:51] <+emperordread> Elmo gets seniority
[3:59:55] <KaitlynnHere> But he’d scratch you out of fear
[3:59:56] <teefpal> so if you sacrifice them its no biggie
[3:59:57] <+cubbywolf> age before beuty

[4:16:09] <Dementedpenguin> The real evil was the scrip.
[4:16:10] <MrATheGreat> The daring message seems to be "pedo preists are bad."

[4:18:35] <%JoshManVGH> Hwa?
[4:18:35] <RenniGlo> I was mad when I realized that was why
[4:18:35] <MrATheGreat> That's fucking stupid
[4:18:36] <teefpal> HOW does that make sense
[4:18:36] <%JamesCorck> I feel like this is a "Rocks fall they all die" sort of ending :/

[4:18:42] <%JoshManVGH> huh?
[4:18:42] <+ScrapKingKeita> That's absolutely stupid

[4:18:50] <+cubbywolf> but you didnt pick the right choices?
[4:18:50] <OvaltineDream> No uncertain fearful dismissive
[4:18:50] <scrumbotime> you didn't redeem them enough
[4:18:50] <Junkles> you didn't save them enough
[4:18:50] <+orochiblood> you didnt fix their S links you lose
[4:18:50] <heart_raid_> this seems dumb
[4:18:51] <AMajorTom> Wait, you have to do the opposite of what the character would do?
[4:18:52] <%greasypete00> you didn't do the right thing over the game so you just die
[4:18:53] <Zaphire_Saucypants> Your dialogue choices matter, the traits..
[4:18:53] <%GarbageNirvana> ARBITRARY DECISIONS GET FUCKED
[4:18:53] <jett_eyes> BAD GAME
[4:18:54] <%Bluwizard21> you lost them cause u didnt do the right actions to unlock their characters
[4:18:55] <generalve> @PeachSaliva because some choices were considered "cowardly" for example they can still get killed
[4:18:56] <critiquequartz> Idk if you guys got it or not but it’s implied Girl was being abused by priest and that’s why she was acting out, which is why Andy blamed her for the fire/ witch hunts and everyone’s deaths, by saving her you make him forgive her and come to peace with his family’s deaths. Also those deaths were based on personality traits they got based on the way Andy saw them in the past and since they didn’t over come them they die.
[4:18:57] <@SoFarFetched> YEAH
[4:18:57] <KaitlynnHere> Make yourself perfect the game
[4:18:58] <+thebeargoesHONK> Brave
[4:19:00] <+Grayhammatter> WHAT?
[4:19:02] <+cvp5127> yes
[4:19:02] <+JonathLP> Brave
[4:19:02] <owazowski> You were supposed embody their flaws which sucks
[4:19:03] <tanarath> So, the narrator said 'Act in their best natures'
[4:19:03] <@SoFarFetched> CAUSE YOU HAD TAYLOR AND JOHN BE FEAFUL
[4:19:04] <CurrySauseBandit> Fearful is typically a negative guys
[4:19:04] <mr_saturday93> It gets dumber
[4:19:05] <BaeSoora> welp
[4:19:06] <+thebeargoesHONK> is fearful be brave
[4:19:07] <%cobalt_phoenix_> this fuckin sucks
[4:19:08] <%GabeSweetMan> That is TERRIBLY explained.
[4:19:08] <@SoFarFetched> INSTEAD OF"I WILL HANDLE THIS"
[4:19:09] <%AncelDeLambert> why are we playing AGAINST type, when in the previous game playing to type was the answer?
[4:19:09] <jett_eyes> IT'S BAD
[4:19:11] <+cubbywolf> seems like a really gamification of the ending
[4:19:11] <tanarath> And you didn't
[4:19:12] <DashXero> This doesn't make any goddamn sense.
[4:19:13] <OneThousandTomatoes> idk
[4:19:14] <%Agami23> you didnt play the characters the way the game liked, so you get punished even though everything you did was right. so fuck you
[4:19:14] <%Keyd00d> 🤔
[4:19:17] <vonmaultke> you were supposed to work to correct their flaws
[4:19:17] <Zaphire_Saucypants> Gotta get over your character flaws
[4:19:19] <+SWFanatic> Feel bad these ghost assholes died
[4:19:20] <+G_Thunders> You were supposed to be altruistic and nice every step of the way

[4:19:22] <Monkeyweed21> WHY ARENT THEY DOING ANYTHING
[4:19:23] <+Taisuru> BOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO
[4:19:24] <+orochiblood> you didnt make the characters better people so you lose
[4:19:24] <Aleate> You obviously should have known somehow idk
[4:19:25] <rustybuckethead21> it doesn't matter now
[4:19:26] <+cubbywolf> your choices caused them to get stuck in a building and stand there
[4:19:26] <nomolomo> wasn't it clear that you had to overcome your flaws?
[4:19:26] <DianaTheAscian> wow this is terrible
[4:19:26] <%Keyd00d> how were you to know
[4:19:27] <MrATheGreat> They died because they were scurred

[4:19:32] <Zaphire_Saucypants> and yes, I know it's fucking stupid.
[4:19:32] <Jetsfantasy> Pat had John say "Help me" instead of sacrificing himself
[4:19:32] <KaitlynnHere> Gotta get over your human traits
[4:19:32] <$RealThiele> not strong and big
[4:19:33] <jett_eyes> THAT WAS THE END??????
[4:19:35] <sydowoodo> okay, but that's stupid

[4:24:22] <AtisutoCurry> "THATS IT YOU FUCKED UP HA GOODBYE"
[4:24:23] <+realm_forge> This just makes you feel bad
[4:24:23] <TheHeroAppears> lets do it again :)
[4:24:24] <ape_hawk> this is soooooooooo stupid
[4:24:24] <+CaptainJax> NOTHING HAPPENED
[4:24:24] <studleydoorite> imagine playing this twice
[4:24:24] <$cgreene64> If you shoot one of the monsters, Vince calls the cops on you
[4:24:25] <+A0N33> You can get him fucking arrested in one ending LUL
[4:24:26] <augusta_wind> the result wouldn't matter either way!!!
[4:24:26] <@SoFarFetched> WHAT IS GOING ON
[4:24:27] <+EyeFarted> I DEMAND A REFUND
[4:24:27] <%Keyd00d> but they didn't exist what different result
[4:24:28] <DXLelouch24> onto Ashes
[4:24:28] <lethallylactic> What different result?!
[4:24:29] <+JonathLP> Herr Starr is the best part of these games
[4:24:29] <HaroldDonchee> play our game again plz it's not that bad
[4:24:29] <bear_breaker20> narrator is mad his story sucked
[4:24:29] <+Ketronox> did you tell him your worst fear was a bad game?
[4:24:30] <%Gogogolem> what a twist.
[4:24:30] <KaitlynnHere> Wooooooow!
[4:24:30] <godzookylives> jesus fucking christ
[4:24:32] <+realm_forge> TRY AGAIN LOSER
[4:24:32] <Darkfire346> still think Peter Stormare was a better narrator
[4:24:34] <+cubbywolf> get fucked
[4:24:34] <Jetsfantasy> m6kwKromegalul
[4:24:35] <%lemon_rinds> Even HE is pissed at the ending
[4:24:35] <lethallylactic> No they didn't!
[4:24:35] <+TungstenViper> this is so badly written i can't even...
[4:24:36] <miniyuna> what wa s  the twist
[4:24:36] <AtisutoCurry> BURRRRRRRRRRRRRNED LOSER
[4:24:37] <shotgang86> So everyone were demons?
[4:24:37] <TehMud> HES TALKING ABOUT MIND GOBLINS
[4:24:38] <Mister_McDerp> some?
[4:24:39] <+ScrapKingKeita> Wow, this is stupidly pass aggressively pretentious
[4:24:39] <%Gogogolem> That M-night Shamlan esque
[4:24:40] <+cvp5127> who? the imaginary ppl
[4:24:40] <%ElkRiverDog> Yah, nah, I'm good man
[4:24:41] <teefpal> Get FUCKED
[4:24:41] <KaitlynnHere> No I’m fine
[4:24:41] <+withguac> The next game is better
[4:24:41] <Psyramics> what different result, none of them were real so none of them actually died
[4:24:43] <+Taisuru> NONE OF THEM EXISTED
[4:24:43] <MaybeFalco> what?
[4:24:43] <rustybuckethead21> none of them ever existed
[4:24:47] <+JonathLP> Vince found redemption. Anthony didn't
[4:24:47] <@SoFarFetched> Daniel and Angele I guess had redemption
[4:24:47] <MrATheGreat> LUL
[4:24:47] <%Bluwizard21> @PeachSaliva The other endings are no better
[4:24:49] <Zeif00> LUL
[4:24:49] <@SoFarFetched> angela*
[4:24:49] <+Rofiarf> the demons in his mind i guess
[4:24:52] <%Agami23> so this is very clearly a rip off of a specific movie
[4:24:53] <+cubbywolf> they existed once didnt they?
[4:24:53] <%ItsRatman> "Thats the problem with hallucinations... they dont matter!"
[4:24:53] <%Keyd00d> so smug about the bad game
[4:24:53] <owazowski> MIND GOBLINS
[4:24:54] <BoxNavy> you love it
[4:24:55] <miniyuna> WHU HAPUN
[4:24:57] <TTouchdown> Some? There was only one!?!?
[4:24:57] <Zeif00> lmao fuck this game
[4:24:58] <NireFuster> This is so dumb it's making me *physically* angry
[4:24:59] <%ForneusAtSeaWorld> if you shoot at the guy he calls the cops on you
[4:25:00] <%weapon000> I wanted the Curator to just be "  Well that was a shit show wasn't it?"
[4:25:00] <Sol_Install> mind gobbos
[4:25:01] <lethallylactic> At least the next one is better
[4:25:02] <ohno778> literal mind goblins
[4:25:02] <OmegaWeltall> it's all your falt Peach!!!
[4:25:02] <%g0atmeal> should we even play these anymore??
[4:25:02] <commanderapathy> this is aids
[4:25:03] <@MelBrooksKA> This is so fucking stupid
[4:25:05] <Chaoko99> literally all of this was caused by the state trooper not telling the bus driver he's crazy
[4:25:06] <$Niney_Who> You literally get arrested in one ending
[4:25:06] <+JonathLP> Vince made peace with Anthony, but Anthony still cray cray
[4:25:06] <+BIumen> they all end with the same thing of them being dead its pointless
[4:25:06] <nomolomo> the other endings have very little variation
[4:25:07] <teefpal> This is why expectations were so low for House of Ashes
[4:25:07] <%MarylandJutsu> @PeachSaliva at least the next episode is apparently beter?
[4:25:07] <Zaphire_Saucypants> it's actually a good thing you didn't have the gun
[4:25:09] <AtisutoCurry> MIND GOBLINS, WHAT A TWISSSST
[4:25:09] <+xcompleasedad> He kills himself in one, with Mary haunting his ass
[4:25:15] <holyxgrale> Being this smug with such a shit ending, he's pretty cool
[4:25:15] <+AmanisHouseOfNonsense> hoo boy, can't wait to see the vod
[4:25:15] <+Mekhet09> You know. I do have to ask what happened to mary? Did she die with them?
[4:25:17] <ape_hawk> I don't think the writers know what mental health problems are like
[4:25:18] <UnImprest> better than Until Dawn, amirite guys?
[4:25:19] <LVL1_Scumbag> Until Dawn was lightning in a bottle, wasn't it?
[4:25:21] <Sitromxe> Get excited for the next installment of Dark Pictures!
[4:25:21] <+NiktenKing> Redeemed them of the qualities he had last remembered because he wanted a good family.
[4:25:22] <%Dapper_Cactuar> the other endings are actually worse
[4:25:22] <+kyh9> House of Ashes is much better
[4:25:24] <%QueequegTheater> Or some third place
[4:25:25] <Sol_Install> Little hope and the ship were the WORST
[4:25:27] <NeroInfinite> yuh he tries to kill himself if you ahd the gun
[4:25:28] <%hrbeck_> He has schizophrenia, dude- you don’t just put that behind you
[4:25:29] <+BIumen> "at least one more game in our contract with sony"
[4:25:29] <+xcompleasedad> @LVL1_Scumbag Oh yeah
[4:25:30] <%MarylandJutsu> I've heard House of Ashes is good
[4:25:31] <MrATheGreat> BONUS FEATURE PogChamp
[4:25:32] <TheHeroAppears> house of ashes is really good
[4:25:34] <%Keyd00d> at least one more time... if we make enough money
[4:25:34] <BoxNavy> house of asses
[4:25:36] <%skm742> House of Ashes would be a better title for this game
[4:25:37] <%thetunnelhomer> House of Ashes hype?
[4:25:39] <DancesWitBalrog> this is the dumbest
[4:25:39] <%skm742> ... yeah that.
[4:25:40] <NireFuster> aaahh aaaah
[4:25:40] <+bread_assassin> IT doesn't matter how many people you kill. It all depends on how you treat Vince.
[4:25:40] <+EyeFarted> BOOOOO
[4:25:42] <+JonathLP> House of Ashes was actually really good.
[4:25:42] <augusta_wind> what a great game
[4:25:43] <+Grayhammatter> what a trash game
[4:25:43] <Sol_Install> House of ashes
[4:25:43] <Dr_Mooose> awful
[4:25:43] <SaiyanShoto> I  heard  house of ashes is much better
[4:25:44] <nomolomo> THAT WAS FUN
[4:25:44] <+Taisuru> BOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO
[4:25:45] <MaybeFalco> it was not great
[4:25:45] <NeroInfinite> It was SUPER trash
[4:25:45] <CanadianAnimatorGuy> BOOOOOOOOOO
[4:25:46] <Monkeyweed21> House of Ashes is WAY better than this
[4:25:46] <Sol_Install> NO
[4:25:47] <Senselessvirus> House of Ashes better blow our fucking minds or this anthology is gonna end up a trilogy.
[4:25:47] <SociallyAwkwardToaster> BOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO
[4:25:47] <%GabeSweetMan> I'm not terribly hopeful given the trajectory of the quality of these.
[4:25:47] <Zeif00> SourPls
[4:25:48] <%SveriSageAdvice> i bet this is DMCA upcoming lol
[4:25:48] <%cobalt_phoenix_> SO BAD

[4:25:50] <%AncelDeLambert> that t'aint good
[4:25:50] <KaitlynnHere> Arabian desert sounds like a cool location
[4:25:50] <Nekros4442> House of Ashes is apparently alot better at least
[4:25:50] <%thetunnelhomer> BOOO
[4:25:51] <Darkfire346> that was a game
[4:25:52] <Sol_Install> fuck she got a point

[4:25:57] <NeroInfinite> DMCA the music. LUL
[4:25:58] <%Dapper_Cactuar> House of Ashes is the only decent one of all 3
[4:25:58] <$Dutchpotato> Everything isn’t fake in house of ashes
[4:25:58] <MyNameIsRasus> Little Hope? More like Little to no Quality
[4:25:59] <+ReallyBigRocks> this is louder than everything else in the game
[4:25:59] <cherrycottontail> so what exactly was the story
[4:25:59] <+emperordread> <Jurrassic Park kazzoo . mp3>
[4:25:59] <+MegadBlitz> oh my god I missed it?
[4:25:59] <DracaenaLeaf> music is loud and bad
[4:26:00] <%Agami23> so this game is pretty much a rip off of a movie called "identity"
[4:26:00] <chocobodundee> I really like the monster designs?
[4:26:01] <MrATheGreat> FUCK IT
[4:26:01] <Sol_Install> IT was SHIT

[4:26:08] <Mister_McDerp> the worst game they've made
[4:26:09] <Monkeyweed21> @Senselessvirus its not as good as until dawn but its better than Man of Medan
[4:26:10] <mr_saturday93> The whole witch shit was pointless
[4:26:10] <Quiet__Viking> music is super loud
[4:26:11] <+Taisuru> LOUD
[4:26:11] <commanderapathy> @peachsaliva I hope you'll enjoy the next game, it's margins better than this crap

[4:26:24] <Darkfire346> this version of O death SUCKS
[4:26:24] <MrATheGreat> espcially now that TellTale's dead
[4:26:24] <NireFuster> THANK YOU
[4:26:26] <TehMud> LUL
[4:26:26] <+cubbywolf> now i can hear LUL
[4:26:28] <+SilverDevilfish> They're just Horror Telltale...
[4:26:29] <+MegadBlitz> what a shitty violin
[4:26:29] <shotgang86> thank you
[4:26:30] <%Keyd00d> How fast did Pat call that entire ending? Like 10 minutes in?
[4:26:31] <%MarylandJutsu> At least the next one is beetter?
[4:26:31] <%GabeSweetMan> Now we can hear
[4:26:31] <KaitlynnHere> I can barely hear you paige
[4:26:32] <tanarath> Paige, you've muted before
[4:26:33] <+realm_forge> PAIGE
[4:26:33] <critiquequartz> Oh death oh death
[4:26:33] <DianaTheAscian> THAT WAS TERRIBLE
[4:26:36] <Sol_Install> thank you
[4:26:37] <+cubbywolf> telltale still has worse ones... i think
[4:26:37] <KaitlynnHere> There we go
[4:26:41] <sun312772> They've done this already in the other games
[4:26:42] <nomolomo> that was shite
[4:26:43] <+CookieCutter007> it isn't until dawn
[4:26:44] <%g0atmeal> AMAZING
[4:26:45] <%cobalt_phoenix_> SHITE
[4:26:45] <%GabeSweetMan> That was god awful
[4:26:47] <+JonathLP> AWFUL
[4:26:47] <sydowoodo> disappointing
[4:26:47] <%AncelDeLambert> that wasn't interesting or good
[4:26:47] <+TungstenViper> this is CreepShow for idiots
[4:26:48] <+SimplyPandaz> Bad is the word
[4:26:48] <shotgang86> that was bad
[4:26:50] <MrATheGreat> Trainwreck ending
[4:26:50] <NireFuster> that was terrible
[4:26:51] <teefpal> @cubbywolf Worse than this?  No.
[4:26:51] <laserbeaming> that was terrible
[4:26:51] <+lordericter> this game was smelly
[4:26:52] <generalve> NOT GOOD
[4:26:52] <Monkeyweed21> BAD
[4:26:52] <+NiktenKing> POOR
[4:26:52] <KaitlynnHere> So good
[4:26:52] <%Garthunox> nothing is worse than season 3 of TWD
[4:26:52] <HaroldDonchee> shitty. just say it sucked
[4:26:52] <%BinaryFireball> its ok if you dont remember crap about the beginning
[4:26:53] <Ion_Laser> that was a hot mess
[4:26:53] <+Grayhammatter> amazingly shite
[4:26:53] <DXLelouch24> Trash
[4:26:53] <Jetsfantasy> That was D-movie tier
[4:26:56] <jacobknight13> just wow
[4:26:56] <KaitlynnHere> Lol
[4:26:57] <%weapon000> @Keyd00d As soon as they were in the bar.  The first scene
[4:26:57] <Sol_Install> they're a studio trying but man it was shit
[4:26:58] <+cubbywolf> being able to laugh at the game is also fun
[4:26:59] <+bread_assassin> I don't mind what they did with having the characters overcome their character flaws, but everyone being imaginary killed it for me/
[4:26:59] <+swesterly> solid concept but a terrible execution, Until Dawn was good but everything since is awful
[4:27:01] <DancesWitBalrog> what was the point
[4:27:01] <teefpal> This was Z-tier
[4:27:02] <+JonathLP> That was so bad it was horrible
[4:27:02] <Zeif00> I feel like I was slapped in the face several times
[4:27:02] <%vVAstrAVv> it sure was..... lol
[4:27:03] <DXLelouch24> what was F Tier
[4:27:03] <nomolomo> yeah but b horror usually is more self-aware
[4:27:04] <SulfurousAcid> that was C at best
[4:27:05] <RenniGlo> Until Dawn was the best
[4:27:05] <NireFuster> That wasn't even B movie, that was a strong F
[4:27:06] <+AmanisHouseOfNonsense> They went TOO B movie here. C even.
[4:27:08] <teefpal> It's not fun at all
[4:27:09] <generalve> House of Ashes > Man of medan " Little Hope
[4:27:09] <commanderapathy> this wasn't even b
[4:27:10] <%AncelDeLambert> LUL Pat's reaction
[4:27:10] <DXLelouch24> failing grade
[4:27:11] <SunsetJack> It feels pointless lol
[4:27:11] <%GabeSweetMan> Man of Medan at least HAD stakes.
[4:27:14] <%Ranryu692> garbage
[4:27:14] <RenniGlo> Everything else I've played after has made me sad
[4:27:14] <NeroInfinite> House Of Ashes is slightly better.
[4:27:16] <m1a_gunner> sipsipHellmo
[4:27:16] <+NiktenKing> High school project tier
[4:27:17] <DancesWitBalrog> trash tieer
[4:27:18] <+Mekhet09> Insufferable.
[4:27:18] <Monkeyweed21> this is C or D tier
[4:27:18] <laserbeaming> this was cringe
[4:27:21] <rustybuckethead21> this was like a movie that gave you tons of info about characters/places/stuff, only to come at the end and say all that you memorized was not important, because "it wasn't real".
[4:27:22] <+Mekhet09> It was up it's own as.
[4:27:22] <nomolomo> this tried SO HARD to be more than what it actually was
[4:27:23] <+MightyDuckShoes> oh no. I missed it. Were they ghosts?!
[4:27:25] <+ReallyBigRocks> It's a game about choice that relies on the characters doing dumb shit thats out of your control
[4:27:25] <+cubbywolf> the Witch stuff isn't interesting at all to me
[4:27:26] <+TungstenViper> Until Done was OK, this whole series is TRASH,
[4:27:27] <%AncelDeLambert> Man of Medan had the cardinal issue of "fucking hell I hate all of these people"
[4:27:28] <Sol_Install> man of medan was just fart gas
[4:27:28] <Darkfire346> Until Dawn was the shit, tho
[4:27:28] <+DJFakie> I saw a playthrough of House of Ashes that seemed alright
[4:27:32] <NireFuster> Until Dawn was so much better than this man
[4:27:34] <devanmuse> the twist invalidates the ENTIRE EXPERIENCE
[4:27:35] <sydowoodo> wait what
[4:27:35] <KaitlynnHere> This hurt me on a cellular level
[4:27:35] <DXLelouch24> @MightyDuckShoes it was all in his head
[4:27:36] <%GabeSweetMan> EEEEVIL
[4:27:36] <Zaphire_Saucypants> just the implication
[4:27:37] <teefpal> @NeroInfinite That's so fucking damming of a review.
[4:27:37] <%ItsRatman> The unreliable narrator trope is hard to do well... but like... fuck
[4:27:38] <%Dapper_Cactuar> the twists in Man of Medan and Little Hope ruin the story for me
[4:27:38] <hearingthenseeing> Good point
[4:27:39] <%GabeSweetMan> EVIL ONE
[4:27:42] <%Bluwizard21> @PeachSaliva He wasn't a pedo she saw in his bible
[4:27:43] <nomolomo> Tried so hard to be like silent hill
[4:27:43] <commanderapathy> @monkeyweed21 is there a tier lower than that
[4:27:44] <bob900000> like Bioshock infinite
[4:27:46] <$RealThiele> the prequel bit of LH was uneeded
[4:27:47] <+cubbywolf> they fucking whisper the evidence which is just hearsay but then he defiles a bibble? wtf
[4:27:52] <+MightyDuckShoes> @DXLelouch24 Of course.
[4:27:52] <$Kaiser_Loar> This is the movie The Village
[4:27:53] <BackflipCharm> According to the wiki he's not a pedo. He just is the one who got Mary into witchcraft
[4:27:55] <MrATheGreat> Step 1, there was no need for a twist
[4:27:55] <Sol_Install> little hope is just shite
[4:27:56] <Dementedpenguin> This just makes me want to revisit Until Dawn as a cleanser.
[4:27:56] <Darkfire346> Man of Medan was alright, House of aShes is apparently waaaay better
[4:27:56] <sailercartridge> Thanks for playing it so we don't have to
[4:27:57] <%MarylandJutsu> At least the next one is good??
[4:27:59] <+kyh9> HE WAS A PEDO
[4:28:01] <Aleate> No he was I am pretty sure
[4:28:01] <reginault> "she bewitched me first"
[4:28:01] <laserbeaming> yes, he was a pedo
[4:28:03] <Sol_Install> I'm hoping house of ashes
[4:28:04] <critiquequartz> Idk he was a ped
[4:28:04] <+cubbywolf> he was doing stuff to her
[4:28:05] <Heyestus> very milquetoast
[4:28:05] <Sol_Install> Is good
[4:28:07] <OneThousandTomatoes> i have no idea what happened
[4:28:09] <+BIumen> this game just lies to you i hate it
[4:28:10] <MyNameIsRasus> He seemed pretty pedo
[4:28:10] <scrumbotime> no, no the priest was a big pedo in the 70s and the past priest was just a trauma metaphor
[4:28:12] <teefpal> I didn't see a writers credit, I think the guy who wrote this tiook themselves out of the credits
[4:28:12] <nomolomo> but at least silent hill dared to tackle sensitive subject matters. here they just tiptoed around everything
[4:28:12] <+ScrapKingKeita> Like, there is an actual plot thing and a meta narrative thing, the latter being he was probably a pedo
[4:28:16] <%Agami23> but what about the devil in the 70's that was behind megan?
[4:28:17] <+TristonObv> This seems like it would have been great if it was just the reincarnation thing
[4:28:18] <+Mekhet09> @PeachSaliva he wasn't a pedo I just read the synopsis. His wife got enslaved and he practiced devil shit and he used mary to kill people he didn't like.
[4:28:18] <Mister_McDerp> the it was all inside your head twist is fucking terrible, even when it is written well
[4:28:19] <+BoboDaHobo> with every release since Until Dawn you can tell more and more that they didn't know why Until Dawn was beloved
[4:28:19] <Monkeyweed21> @commanderapathy no its a D because its so painfully boring it cant even be fun to mock
[4:28:19] <+tempestzephyr> this game BAD
[4:28:20] <MrATheGreat> Step 2) take away chars dying for innocous reasons
[4:28:23] <+cubbywolf> Priests are bad yes
[4:28:24] <twistedj3ster> David Cage snuck into the studio I guess
[4:28:25] <CrowbarFacelift> Was good for some unintentional laughs
[4:28:28] <Zaphire_Saucypants> When you doing House of Ashes? @PeachSaliva
[4:28:29] <nomolomo> its great when you play a game that makes you feel like nothing you did mattered
[4:28:30] <%lemon_rinds> Insultingly bad
[4:28:33] <%ForneusAtSeaWorld> I was trapped on a ship and played this gam. sshoulda read a book
[4:28:34] <DancesWitBalrog> hey everyone, lets go play a better game. like Bloodborne
[4:28:35] <+cubbywolf> the traits just seem so meaningless
[4:28:40] <Jetsfantasy> He might as well just have had "I ❤️ Satan" written in that bible
[4:28:42] <+kyh9> “It’s all a dream” continues to be the shittiest plot twist ever
[4:28:42] <MrATheGreat> Yeah, and that's cool
[4:28:42] <sun312772> How did you not get that Paige ??
[4:28:44] <Sol_Install> it was cool at the start and then it tumbleweed down a cliff
[4:28:50] <+SWFanatic> Instructions unclear: Ghost Zombie Magic
[4:28:51] <%GabeSweetMan> Nope
[4:28:55] <%g0atmeal> this entire experience literally wastes your time on things that never matter, and it even tells you it matters
[4:28:59] <nomolomo> no the characters literally felt just like different skins rather than actual people
[4:29:00] <+bread_assassin> Did the Curator hint at anything?
[4:29:04] <%GabeSweetMan> It was hyper unclear.
[4:29:11] <tanarath> The narrator gave a shitty hint
[4:29:12] <+BIumen> they arent real people theyre. dead.
[4:29:13] <teefpal> It's just stupid as fuck and is there to force multiple playthroughs
[4:29:14] <Angerest> NO, play by our arbitrary rules, got lost
[4:29:18] <@SoFarFetched> geefThink
[4:29:19] <Zaphire_Saucypants> There were a few times you weren't
[4:29:19] <+CaptainJax> you should have fail RP'd
[4:29:20] <%cobalt_phoenix_> HE WAS
[4:29:22] <BoxNavy> thats all ya had to do
[4:29:23] <+MegadBlitz> so they're all dead
[4:29:23] <%GabeSweetMan> WHAT?
[4:29:23] <vicar_anat> EVEN MORE
[4:29:24] <commanderapathy> but none of it mattered, because they were all him!
[4:29:25] <MrATheGreat> This has "replay value" written all over these bad decisions
[4:29:25] <%ItsRatman> John needed to be MORE of an asshole
[4:29:26] <$RealThiele> assertive coward
[4:29:26] <+shootbang_exe> ....but none of them are real?
[4:29:27] <bear_breaker20> he had big small pp energy
[4:29:27] <+cubbywolf> how did angela make it through? her last words were kill the child oh i guess kill the preist
[4:29:29] <Monkeyweed21> WAIT MORE ASSERTIVE
[4:29:30] <ohno778> absurdive
[4:29:30] <+TungstenViper> wtf LUL
[4:29:30] <ape_hawk> but all of that doesnt matter because the characters werent even real!!!
[4:29:30] <+shootbang_exe> why does that matter
[4:29:30] <+Rofiarf> no you kept picking non assertive choices
[4:29:32] <OneThousandTomatoes> he needs to be less an asshole
[4:29:35] <%GabeSweetMan> John was making TERRIBLE DECISIONS!
[4:29:36] <twistedj3ster> He was an ass!
[4:29:36] <AtisutoCurry> NO YOU MUST PLAY BY O U R RULES
[4:29:39] <MyNameIsRasus> It doesn't matter they're not real
[4:29:40] <Zaphire_Saucypants> You kept waffling with John
[4:29:40] <bob900000> it was probably the part with the door
[4:29:42] <Toolchest_> does it explain why it matter any if any of the fake people live?
[4:29:42] <+HiroTSK5> But the dad originally wasn't assertive I guess?
[4:29:44] <KaitlynnHere> Assertive of his dick
[4:29:45] <+Ilpala> you fucked him when you were like "Oh I dunno maybe we can consider all our options" when everyone volunteered him
[4:29:45] <%g0atmeal> are we supposed to accept that their personality made them not walk out the door at the end?
[4:29:45] <Jetsfantasy> Pat made him waver at the door bit as well
[4:29:46] <+cubbywolf> HE WASNT EVEN A BOYFRIEND
[4:29:47] <devanmuse> Literally why? they're figments of your imagination
[4:29:47] <VritraReiRei> @PeachSaliva you want to know the worst part: what you got is the BEST ENDING. The ending would not have changed much if you saved all the characters. You saved enough. The only differences are if you killed Mary or killed everyone
[4:29:47] <teefpal> How bad is House of Ashes compared to this?
[4:29:48] <+SWFanatic> Its fine
[4:29:50] <bakkatohri> I don't mind if narrative games force endings to get you to replay them. It's something that VN games like Zero Escape do well.
[4:29:52] <%BinaryFireball> i just made choices that I liked instead of trying to change the characters...because why???
[4:29:53] <HaroldDonchee> I thought the locks meant like that character was stuck that way. like locked in to be fearful
[4:29:58] <Monkeyweed21> @teefpal WAY better
[4:30:01] <%g0atmeal> they died for no reason
[4:30:02] <+EyeFarted> [X] to Skip
[4:30:03] <+Rofiarf> well you picked cowardly choices for john
[4:30:06] <commanderapathy> @g0atmeal apparently
[4:30:07] <+OrangeMDT> Needed anti-Pat stance at the door, probably
[4:30:10] <+Mekhet09> It doesn't even matter.
[4:30:10] <%SovPho> are they real if they all survive?
[4:30:12] <+cubbywolf> play that next!
[4:30:15] <MrATheGreat> Wait does that mean the "choices" don't  matter only the reasons behind why they were made?
[4:30:21] <%SovPho> i know that's a dumb question but it's a dumb game
[4:30:21] <+cubbywolf> i wanna see that through peach's eyes
[4:30:23] <+ZephynM> I see House of Ashes on Steam, actually. Was thinking about picking it up for something new and different.
[4:30:23] <+kyh9> House of Ashes is actually good
[4:30:24] <%Agami23> house of ashes is better but the local multiplayer might actually ruin it
[4:30:28] <teefpal> Does House of Ashes have the same pointless bullshit?
[4:30:29] <%GabeSweetMan> It would understand if they just made their final sequence way HARDER as a result, but just killing them off with ZERO player input is unbelievable.
[4:30:32] <%Saadi90> House of ashes is good
[4:30:33] <Jetsfantasy> Not only you, Paige. Pat's self-survival killed John I think LUL
[4:30:36] <%Bluwizard21> @PeachSaliva The scary game squad played this when it came out, they did way worse and got a better ending its garbage game
[4:30:36] <+NiktenKing> Dad let people step all over him. didnt want to speak out for his job or against his friends taking him out to drink
[4:30:38] <%cobalt_phoenix_> @cubbywolf it'll just be a big blur
[4:30:41] <%JoshManVGH> lol if they all die, he has the SAME conversation at the end, with not even the phantoms there!!
[4:30:41] <generalve> ALL IN THE HEAD
[4:30:43] <$NitronStreams> "Glass him"
[4:30:46] <Monkeyweed21> House of Ashes might be better than Man of Medan
[4:30:49] <sun312772> You dumb paige and  so is this game
[4:30:50] <critiquequartz> THE GAME GASLIT YOU
[4:30:51] <+cubbywolf> gun must be a red herring
[4:30:52] <+Rofiarf> yeah, doesn't make sense
[4:30:52] <%QueequegTheater> For Pat: were there any choices as unclear as "Conjure" from Detroit
[4:30:55] <%SovPho> lmao
[4:30:57] <+kyh9> The entire “DUDE ITS ALL A HALLUCINATION” is always the shittiest plot focus
[4:30:59] <Dr_Mooose> "best"
[4:31:05] <MrATheGreat> LUL
[4:31:05] <%GabeSweetMan> accidental best ending
[4:31:06] <+CaptainJax> THE PEOPLE WERENT REAL PAIGE
[4:31:08] <critiquequartz> Lol
[4:31:15] <MyNameIsRasus> You get over it, you get arrested or you kill yourself
[4:31:16] <%GabeSweetMan> DOESN'T MATTER
[4:31:17] <AMajorTom> They still just disappear
[4:31:27] <+cubbywolf> he should be arrested for sure
[4:31:29] <+realm_forge> Best = dumb and depressing apparently
[4:31:35] <+cubbywolf> this man needs help
[4:31:36] <twistedj3ster> At least we got the sham to move the rock....
[4:31:37] <%Ranryu692> except for when Bob Newhart did it
[4:31:41] <+MegadBlitz> what if they WERE real
[4:31:41] <+ZephynM> Does Pat have any interest in playing God of War again when it comes out on Steam in January?
[4:31:41] <%cobalt_phoenix_> so were the monsters real?
[4:31:42] <%ForneusAtSeaWorld> and then cop
[4:31:46] <Chaoko99> At very least the "he's crazy" plotline is somewhat consistent. It isn't like the ending recap adds any details we didn't see.
[4:31:47] <+cubbywolf> that cop sucked ass
[4:31:48] <%Garthunox> @PeachSaliva its emulating silent hill but poorly, another one on the pile
[4:31:49] <+CaptainJax> no monsters were not real eiither
[4:31:49] <Aleate> Yeyeye
[4:31:51] <%Dapper_Cactuar> it's such a cop out 90% of the times it's used
[4:31:52] <%g0atmeal> "it was all a dream" was probably good the first time someone ever did it, but never again
[4:31:54] <teefpal> there are few solitary exceptions that prove the rule, like The Fall
[4:31:55] <+Ilpala> Paige: Longest walker
[4:31:56] <TheHeroAppears> this one good
[4:31:57] <MyNameIsRasus> If the dreams actually happen then it can be good
[4:31:59] <$RealThiele> post deez nuts
[4:32:00] <%DJFakie> DJFakie subscribed with Prime. 
[4:32:01] <+cubbywolf> i might buy this game
[4:32:02] <ape_hawk> the real villain is SCHIZOPHRENIA!!
[4:32:10] <+SWFanatic> rat a tat tat
[4:32:12] <Pappajimbo> it was all a snow globe
[4:32:14] <%MarylandJutsu> this one seems kinda cool though
[4:32:19] <MrATheGreat> Oh yeah this showed at E3 Bandai Namco bought a slot JUST for this LMAO
[4:32:21] <%Agami23> bloodborne does the "its all fake, its a dream!" thing pretty well
[4:32:23] <lethallylactic> Oh so it's The Descent
[4:32:28] <+jinking79> oh yeah they made a statue of the monster for this
[4:32:28] <DancesWitBalrog> what was that genshin shit
[4:32:28] <hearingthenseeing> what is this devil language???
[4:32:29] <%thetunnelhomer> Oh hey it's a pazuzu
[4:32:32] <Jetsfantasy> Oh boy, more people are going to have access to guns?
[4:32:33] <Heyestus> black hawk down musou Pog
[4:32:34] <%MechArch> the exorcist demon>
[4:32:34] <Void_The_Dark> Exorcist looking statue
[4:32:34] <nomolomo> literally pazuzu from the exorsist
[4:32:36] <%DJFakie> I liked this one, the threats were actually real
[4:32:39] <+CaptainJax> Bloodborne isn't an its all a dream story because the dreams are fuckin real
[4:32:43] <MaybeFalco> LUL
[4:32:44] <Chaoko99> lmao
[4:32:45] <%Bluwizard21> @Agami23 Except that the dream was effecting reality to a severe degree, it was causing the paleblood

[4:33:18] <coyotezappa> LET'S GO TO THE HOUSE OF ASSES
[4:33:18] <ChrisPlaysThing> Liams least favorite game; House of asses
[4:33:19] <Ion_Laser> House of Asses aka THE BEST HOUSE
[4:33:21] <Ethel9727> The reason "It was all a dream." sucks is because it means it didn't matter. It can work in Silent Hill situations where the "dream" have enough of an impact on the real world that it still matters
[4:33:22] <+cubbywolf> LUL
[4:33:22] <Sol_Install> house of asses, house of acid, house of fun
[4:33:24] <UndeadManatee> house of asses!

[4:33:27] <Zaphire_Saucypants> ye?
[4:33:29] <MrATheGreat> LUL
[4:33:29] <%g0atmeal> Are you gonna play this again to try to get a different ending? :D

[4:33:31] <shotgang86> soonish
[4:33:33] <NireFuster> Looking forward to i! :)
[4:33:33] <Zaphire_Saucypants> I hope so
[4:33:33] <+Rofiarf> next october!
[4:33:40] <+Grayhammatter> i fucking hope so
[4:33:41] <TheHeroAppears> @g0atmeal LUL
[4:33:41] <teefpal> I dunno
[4:33:41] <Zaphire_Saucypants> When?
[4:33:41] <+cubbywolf> not worth replaying
[4:33:41] <+realm_forge> They need to stick to monsters and not “psychological” stories
[4:33:44] <Darkfire346> best one of the Dark pictures series
[4:33:46] <%Bluwizard21> I wanted to name my dog ashes, but the parents would let me because of that slip of the tongue
[4:33:46] <%MarylandJutsu> that was not super great
[4:33:48] <Heyestus> well it couldn't be much worse
[4:33:51] <Sol_Install> is it?
[4:33:52] <Pappajimbo> house of asses now on steam
[4:33:52] <BoxNavy> yea
[4:33:53] <Xeno351> yeah
[4:33:54] <Aleate> Yes
[4:33:54] <teefpal> Yes
[4:33:55] <%MarylandJutsu> yeah its out
[4:33:55] <+TungstenViper> that was horrible
[4:34:00] <+Grayhammatter> ash says
[4:34:00] <Ion_Laser> House of Ashes came out on Oct 22
[4:34:04] <Sol_Install> I'm getting a bit hype
[4:34:06] <Sol_Install> yea
[4:34:08] <+MarkoTolstov> the trailer for the NEXT one after House of Ashes looks kinda good, imo
[4:34:08] <+Grayhammatter> house of ash says
[4:34:08] <%vVAstrAVv> how soon is house of asses cus i was about to start jacksepticeyes lp
[4:34:14] <Darkfire346> play it for Halloween
[4:34:14] <%GabeSweetMan> It's another Twelve Minutes twist that NEGATES 90% of everything in the game by rug pulling the audience and rendering the development mute and void. It doesn't recontextualize anything other than to say "WE LIED TO YOU AUDIENCE. DON'T YOU FEEL DUMB?!"
[4:34:16] <Monkeyweed21> I liked it more than Man of Medan
[4:34:16] <%Ranryu692> so yesterday?
[4:34:24] <+G_Thunders> Takes itself a little too seriously until the plot becomes fucking bonkers and it’s the best
[4:34:29] <%Bluwizard21> the dallas effect
[4:34:30] <+Snaketsu> i wonder what the sick non supernatural twist will be
[4:34:30] <bravebravesrobin> house of pound town
[4:34:34] <%Ranryu692> the second of Bob Newhart's shows did it well
[4:34:34] <%AncelDeLambert> yes
[4:34:41] <chocobodundee> House of Ashes => HoA => Home Owners Association
[4:34:45] <%Agami23> bloodborne is the best "its all a dream" because the dream is real
[4:34:45] <%vVAstrAVv> it was a dream will always be the worst
[4:34:45] <%GabeSweetMan> Precisely
[4:34:47] <Xeno351> only game that's done it actually well is links awakening
[4:34:50] <%GabeSweetMan> BUT YOU COULD DIE
[4:34:53] <teefpal> A Christmas Carol is another example
[4:35:00] <DancesWitBalrog> Bloodborne did this waaay better
[4:35:04] <nomolomo> they tried to have the jacobs ladder character development arch, but it just fucked itself
[4:35:08] <Srthunda> why was he even driving a bus down the road
[4:35:11] <Zaphire_Saucypants> I mean...I think the bus driver grew to accept the past? But eh.
[4:35:13] <Darkfire346> a dude had a wreck and walked around an abandoned town all night doing nothing
[4:35:13] <$Tredecian> a man talk to himself in an abandoned town
[4:35:15] <$SiameseSneeze> Yeah, I like how Man of Medan wasn't supernatural, it was just gas/poison
[4:35:16] <+Ilpala> AND BLACK GUY. BLACK GUY WAS REAL
[4:35:17] <bakkatohri> It was all a dream is a really bad or babby writers write about when they're starting out.
[4:35:20] <bear_breaker20> the only thing thats real is psychosis
[4:35:23] <%g0atmeal> good job pat
[4:35:23] <Gorgs7> a man walked down a road, that's it
[4:35:25] <AMajorTom> Pat is great too
[4:35:26] <MrATheGreat> A  prime example of how NOT to do this shit
[4:35:26] <pennykettle_> the 70s was real, but then the modern day AND the witch trials were all literally nothing
[4:35:28] <susukouhai> "BUT MEEEE"
[4:35:30] <+TungstenViper> NO APT
[4:35:36] <Sol_Install> lul
[4:35:37] <MyNameIsRasus> Yeah it sucks
[4:35:39] <ape_hawk> also you dont "get over" schizophrenia
[4:35:41] <+balouie> there were no stakes
[4:35:43] <Darkfire346> a man walked fown the road tripping balls all night, The Game
[4:35:44] <+Taisuru> He's still totally nuts
[4:35:44] <OvaltineDream> Well that's that
[4:35:46] <+Grayhammatter> yeah, that sucked
[4:35:49] <@commanderclaw> You literally saw an old man's hallucinations for 8 hours
[4:35:50] <%GabeSweetMan> 12 Minutes did the same thing.
[4:35:51] <%ItsRatman> Dude at least needs to go to a hospital or something
[4:35:53] <%g0atmeal> yeah did he get over anything?
[4:35:54] <DracaenaLeaf> it's the goodest ending but not the best ending
[4:35:54] <+Ilpala> any actions whatsoever after the montage
[4:35:55] <$cgreene64> He is still stranded too lol
[4:35:57] <bob900000> finally after 10,000 years!
[4:35:58] <Paperware> How was he in two places at once in some parts of the story?
[4:35:59] <%Garthunox> @PeachSaliva little hope emulates silent hill but poorly, ye another one on the pile that keeps growing higher, dont trust things that look like silent hill
[4:36:00] <nomolomo> for a game with an ending that is so dependent on character improvement, the game had pretty shit characters
[4:36:00] <Dementedpenguin> Oh god, I was reminded of Agent Mulder's "I'm free." line.
[4:36:01] <Zaphire_Saucypants> There's one ending where he's arrested. Another where he kills himself.
[4:36:02] <scrumbotime> my 15 pound cat demands i hold him
[4:36:05] <MrATheGreat> And the person giving them coffee is HOT
[4:36:10] <Not_Paladin> Do we have a day for the House of Ashes stream?
[4:36:11] <nomolomo> make your characters at least somewhat likeable first
[4:36:12] <%ItsRatman> The bus wanst real duh
[4:36:12] <critiquequartz> He needs help like drs/ paramedics talking to him
[4:36:12] <Monkeyweed21> AT LEAST HAVE A CONVERSATION WITH VINCE
[4:36:14] <SulfurousAcid> you hold that cat scrumbo
[4:36:15] <+tempestzephyr> this game is like a gray wet fart
[4:36:15] <SaiyanShoto> He's gonna get fired
[4:36:18] <+emperordread> His bus(sy) is still wrecked
[4:36:20] <Will_The_Soulless> I feel like he just needed to talk to the characters you saved at the end to reconcile with what happened
[4:36:23] <%g0atmeal> i wanna know the details of his bus driving career...
[4:36:27] <$SiameseSneeze> stinker
[4:36:29] <laserbeaming> it didn't
[4:36:34] <jacobknight13> what was the fucking explanation for the witche stuff and going into the past??!??!
[4:36:35] <+Grayhammatter> it did not
[4:36:35] <%Ranryu692> It doesn't deserve the love and respect
[4:36:35] <critiquequartz> Ah yes the best character the bus
[4:36:36] <bob900000> it didn't
[4:36:37] <+ReallyBigRocks> I'm on Pats side here
[4:36:37] <%Ranryu692> it just doesn't
[4:36:38] <+BIumen> i mean they have like 2/3 failures as good as until dawn is
[4:36:39] <laserbeaming> too much respect
[4:36:39] <$NitronStreams> at the end he shoulda said "I've finally got a Little Hope"
[4:36:39] <sydowoodo> can you think of one good thing or nah????
[4:36:42] <Dementedpenguin> This one was bad and they should be told this was bad for their own good.
[4:36:44] <BackflipCharm> It's constructive criticism
[4:36:45] <%GabeSweetMan> Bus-chan didn't deserve this.
[4:36:45] <%doomunderthestairs> ruff ruff indeed lunarSmug
[4:36:47] <$SiameseSneeze> The trailer was cooler than the whole game
[4:36:51] <critiquequartz> No you don’t it’s okay
[4:36:51] <NireFuster> That was very pretentious writing
[4:36:53] <Ethel9727> IT TOOK YOU LIKE FIVE SECONDS
[4:36:55] <Ethel9727> It was amazing
[4:36:56] <cherrycottontail> did you know that 92% of users liked this game?
[4:36:59] <%AncelDeLambert> you can't expect me to care about things that happen in a story, writers, if you don't put the effort in to give me a REASON to care
[4:37:02] <%BinaryFireball> i didnt lol
[4:37:03] <%BinaryFireball> :D
[4:37:04] <+electric_bees> what was even the point of the puritan stuff?
[4:37:05] <+emperordread> I didn't call it at all, am I dumb?
[4:37:07] <+RaziWraith> This felt like a step down from Until Dawn which is saying something LUL
[4:37:12] <TheHeroAppears> no
[4:37:12] <%Bluwizard21> yeah you guessed it same time as anyone who watches horror mystery. The bus was fucking empty at the beginning
[4:37:13] <+Grayhammatter> LUL
[4:37:13] <%vVAstrAVv> you were so accurate it feels like cheating lol
[4:37:14] <@SoFarFetched> doesnt seem like it.

[4:37:16] <+Taisuru> Callouts time

[4:37:16] <%vVAstrAVv> YEP
[4:37:22] <+MightyDuckShoes> who's Astra?
[4:37:23] <Darkfire346> the fact neither the cop nor Vince talked to anyone but the PC, ever
[4:37:23] <%BinaryFireball> i turn off my brain for horror things because i know its always like this

[4:37:56] <Rumbutt> oroLUL
[4:37:57] <laserbeaming> was it thogh?
[4:37:57] <%g0atmeal> it was sort of a video game

[4:37:59] <%GabeSweetMan> Spite Power: MAXIMUM
[4:38:00] <+Rofiarf> pat spites at

[4:38:02] <+Grayhammatter> was it?
[4:38:03] <Heyestus> What's  weird is that Until Dawn has no credited Narrative director but little hope does
[4:38:03] <%SovPho> asses
[4:38:03] <+MegadBlitz> spite can make you do ANYTHING
[4:38:04] <Zaphire_Saucypants> I enjoyed watching you playing it

[4:38:07] <critiquequartz> They could have written the reincarnation story or they could have written the ghost in the head story and they chose to do both

[4:38:17] <%Ranryu692> LUL
[4:38:20] <+Tearonex> @PeachSaliva Well you did callout the entirety of Beyond 2 Souls
[4:38:20] <%GabeSweetMan> I wouldn't have been able to stomach this myself so I appreciated these streams.
[4:38:21] <Sitromxe> You're trying to predict the outcome of a year-old meme game. If you're right, even will think you have foreknowledge, if you're wrong your wrong.
[4:38:21] <%JoshManVGH> Halloweeen is fitting
[4:38:22] <scrumbotime> Yes
[4:38:22] <susukouhai> also they threw both u and woolie under the bus, only woolie gets that!

[4:38:34] <laserbeaming> The Trials didn't matter at all
[4:38:34] <Mister_McDerp> IT WAS ALL DELUSIONS
[4:38:35] <MyNameIsRasus> yeah the pilgrim subplot goes nowhere
[4:38:36] <%Bluwizard21> @PeachSaliva You should start playing it this week cause you don't know how long it will be and can end it on halloween if you play it right (i hope)
[4:38:38] <+ReallyBigRocks> sick
[4:38:39] <Zaphire_Saucypants> One of the books on the subject was in his bus
[4:38:41] <+Grayhammatter> he just tripped hard
[4:38:43] <$RealThiele> oops all delusions
[4:38:48] <chocobodundee> i iwsh it was just a curse
[4:38:48] <jacobknight13> that is beyond stupid
[4:38:49] <+Taisuru> You played a game where NOTHING MATTERED AT ALL
[4:38:53] <whycantipostasguest> the pilgrim shit was so damn boring

[4:41:19] <+Havictos> eh fine whatever
[4:41:21] <$RealThiele> RE:9 Fortnite
[4:41:25] <$shurtal> does Jill have the hat?
[4:41:28] <%weapon000> 10 kills on the board right now
[4:41:30] <%SovPho> Do companies see a significant uptick in game sales when they make a deal with Epic to put their characters in Fortnite?
[4:41:41] <NireFuster> Aaahhh man, they used RE3 remake design and not og RE3 design, bummer, at least the RE1 looks amazing
[4:41:45] <TheZearGuy> Good Jill or remake Jill?
[4:41:51] <Zeif00> oh it's re8 Chris FeelsBadMan
[4:41:54] <T_Sasquatch> At this point i truly wonder how many kids have tried franchises because of Fortnite

[4:41:56] <+Grayhammatter> he loves feet
[4:41:57] <Aleate> Good Jill

[4:42:03] <$RealThiele> show foot for $$$
[4:42:09] <+realm_forge> Paige likes bossy this has been confirmed
[4:42:13] <$SiameseSneeze> Burn the child
[4:42:21] <+SWFanatic> Squint
[4:42:21] <%GabeSweetMan> It wouldn't have mattered. She's dead now anyways.
[4:42:29] <generalve> Ooppps
[4:42:30] <%vVAstrAVv> attacking kids in games sadly remains taboo lol
[4:42:32] <generalve> sorry
[4:42:53] <%Garthunox> ok but why did the child fuck with people in the house at the start?
[4:43:07] <generalve> @PeachSaliva the revernaod was the patrol officer
[4:43:10] <+Mekhet09> The reverand appears once.
[4:43:15] <MrATheGreat> He was the one that
[4:43:17] <+Ilpala> Documents imply she was behind abuse of his sister in 70s
[4:43:22] <%Ranryu692> @vVAstrAVv Little Lamplight continues to mock us
[4:43:26] <cherrycottontail> The reverand was the one that abused his sister in the 70s
[4:43:26] <+Havictos> because shut up
[4:43:29] <BackflipCharm> The whole prologue is a dream
[4:43:32] <MostFrank> Bad writing?
[4:43:34] <$RealThiele> shutup tho
[4:43:35] <StrapStreams> Paige, Pat, thank you both for all the laughs and entertainment over the years! The content the both of you have put out have helped me through some rough times and you two never fail to make those times better. Thank you both so much.
[4:43:38] <MrATheGreat> He was the one that was molested by the priest
[4:43:38] <+SWFanatic> Zangief want
[4:43:42] <cherrycottontail> the entire story is about how reconciling his sister's abuse
[4:43:44] <+trackles_64> Doggo wants food
[4:43:44] <+tempestzephyr> So what about that demon in the begining?
[4:43:50] <All_Salt> @SovPho Relatively. Not a huge increase but obviously enough to make it well worth it.
[4:43:51] <+NiktenKing> He SAW her doll on the stove
[4:43:53] <+ThighsSupreme> Why did the demon not exist
[4:43:53] <%GabeSweetMan> "Don't think about it."
[4:44:03] <Profmcstevie> The...poppet?
[4:44:06] <%Ranryu692> yeah, through the window
[4:44:15] <%BinaryFireball> the whole point is that he didnt know and was left questioning it for years
[4:44:20] <%GabeSweetMan> Also demon that didn't reappear.
[4:44:26] <+tempestzephyr> Did that demon exist or not?
[4:44:32] <+NiktenKing> He was in the room immediately before it was on the stove
[4:44:36] <@SoFarFetched> none of the events mattered geefShrug
[4:44:38] <cherrycottontail> the 70s stuff was real
[4:44:42] <+Taisuru> @BinaryFireball The whole point was that it was pointless
[4:44:50] <%GabeSweetMan> Until Dawn has ALL OF THE TROPES, but ONE IS SUPER REAL AND HYPER DANGEROUS.
[4:44:52] <CanadianAnimatorGuy> Until Dawn's all 6 fake outs it's great
[4:44:55] <$RealThiele> a wendingo ate your baby
[4:44:58] <Ethel9727> Until Dawn is so greatt
[4:44:59] <NireFuster> Until Dawn is honestly not that bad, it's pretty good
[4:45:01] <%Ranryu692> plus it's a Canadian monster
[4:45:02] <Ethel9727> I might have to rewatch the LP
[4:45:10] <+YourRedDog> There were files you can find that suggest both Anthony and the little sister had mental problems, i.e. why she thought she was seeing a big shadow monster talking to her and why he was having giant hallucination episode the whole game.
[4:45:11] <%GabeSweetMan> And having the MOST dangerous one be the REAL one was great.
[4:45:15] <VritraReiRei> @PeachSaliva i think its a metaphor for him forgiving the girl for accidentally setting the fire
[4:45:16] <%ForneusAtSeaWorld> you can get a scene with vince at the funeral and the priest is there in the 70s
[4:45:34] <Tampaoster> Until done? LUL
[4:45:35] <NireFuster> Until Dawn just feels like it was purposefuly made to be like a b movie horror and they legitimately did a good job
[4:45:37] <critiquequartz> The actors were good!
[4:45:37] <+RaziWraith> Until Dawn was decent and the tropes were all of the funny tropes not just bad writing LUL
[4:45:39] <+TungstenViper> it's just that it was better written
[4:45:40] <generalve> @PeachSaliva UD has the advantage because the game is longer, DPA can only tell their stories in less than 5 hours
[4:45:43] <+Havictos> These games hit uncanny to much for me
[4:45:45] <+CatastropheCorvid> Until Dawn is Supermassive's The Wolf Among Us, or TWD season one.
[4:45:46] <Profmcstevie> Oh I saw that streamer mode, what a ride
[4:45:48] <NireFuster> It's full of tropes but they're put there for a purpose
[4:45:48] <ohno778> life is crunge
[4:45:49] <+tempestzephyr> the characters from until dawn are more charismatic
[4:45:59] <+TungstenViper> the writer left SuperMassive after Man of medan... i wonder why LUL
[4:46:04] <Aleate> DON'T look at chat
[4:46:05] <Frostydough1> I actually have a fuck about a character or 2 in until down, all the other ones have yet to achieve that
[4:46:08] <+trackles_64> look at us
[4:46:09] <sun312772> they need a real monster to do good
[4:46:10] <$RealThiele> these stories do better when they have room to breathe this short version stuff is not good
[4:46:15] <%GabeSweetMan> Life Is Strange's trajectory has been baffling. Each game's mechanics have been less interesting than the last.
[4:46:19] <+Havictos> I wish they looked less realistic.
[4:46:26] <%Ranryu692> I think someone spoiled it earlier, and I tried to get rid of it but then remembered I'm not a mod in this chat LUL
[4:46:28] <DracaenaLeaf> ??
[4:46:33] <ZComiX> House of ashes seems like it’s just Delta Green story
[4:46:35] <+emperordread> Can we raid IronMouse?
