[0:03:08] <+konekoryugamine> Wait, they were serious about teh Cage tatoo on their ass?
[0:03:09] <Wyrmsblood> Paige will either take forever to figure out the puzzle she was stuck on last stream, or she'll figure it out almost immediately. There is no middle ground.
[0:03:10] <+LuckyChocobo> Big Portal for big and strong girls.
[0:03:10] <megamonmon123> i wonder how many people who dont know paige would freak out that pat's hot girlfriend is on the podcast
[0:03:17] <+konekoryugamine> XD
[0:03:25] <@Moobot> Do you have a Fanfiction for Paige to read? Submit it to us here and it may get read on stream! http://bit.ly/2jsxJo9

[0:03:34] <%rustyarmor> Hello Today!
[0:03:40] <yosukecchi> i wonder how many times it's going to loop this time

[0:03:48] <+vinnysuperg123> Wait did Pat say he liked Detroit?
[0:03:50] <$GohanEgret> pat better not HORLP this time Kappa
[0:03:55] <cjsugar> Hello today o/
[0:03:56] <+vinnysuperg123> I haven’t kept up with the series
[0:03:56] <superbla25> im late but so are they so its all good
[0:04:06] <%ssjklyco> @megamonmon123 They will hear her talk and go "Yeah, that makes sense"
[0:04:23] <%rustyarmor> they said it has problems but it is the best quantic dream game
[0:04:30] <%rustyarmor> just as a pure mechanical game
[0:04:30] <+konekoryugamine> By far
[0:04:31] <+FrostMass22> They all said they liked it, for some reason. Detroit has good moments but it isn't good because it simply doesn't shit the bed as hard as Heavy Rain
[0:04:41] <@Moobot> YOU'RE BEING TOO LOUD! (kzkinthemorning) (warning)
[0:04:42] <+vinnysuperg123> Yeah cause from what I’ve seen
[0:04:43] <$GohanEgret> @konekoryugamine no, a viewer bet that they would get one if the best friends liked it
[0:04:44] <Bionicghost> what, omnikron?
[0:04:44] <admiral_of_crunch> Well, I'm gonna go watch the last VoD. See ya'll next stream!
[0:04:44] <+vinnysuperg123> It’s not good
[0:04:45] <blackbaron98> BEEP BEEP
[0:04:46] <+vinnysuperg123> But it’s gine
[0:04:48] <thebabycrepes> GayPride
[0:04:49] <+vinnysuperg123> Fine*
[0:04:49] <@Moobot> YOU'RE BEING TOO LOUD! (sosuke5) (warning)
[0:04:51] <yosukecchi> pat likes detroit because he played as the best character
[0:04:51] <megamonmon123> they didnt get the ending with Connor unfortunately
[0:04:55] <+konekoryugamine> @GohanEgret For real?! XD
[0:04:57] <On_Target> so i wasn't here the other day. Where did Peach leave off
[0:05:02] <@BigNaturalMan59> chuuurWdad thebetCas chuuurWdad
[0:05:06] <DFireCreations> We talking bout detroit
[0:05:09] <+konekoryugamine> Yep
[0:05:10] <megamonmon123> you know, the ending that ruins the concept of deviants
[0:05:11] <korsoup> whats good chat
[0:05:11] <cerberuscarmine> rest in popcorn detroit
[0:05:12] <hussdogrob> Can somebody be sure to ask Paige and Pat how much we are allowed to talk about Detroit cause I've got some Geoff Thew filled hate of that game to vent
[0:05:26] <%swordsman70> Oh Boy!
[0:05:31] <+konekoryugamine> @megamonmon123 How does it ruin the concept of deviants? Was Amanda a robot all along?
[0:05:36] <+TheGershon> @hussdogrob I
[0:05:38] <goronhead> I haven't watched the newest detroit episode yet D:
[0:05:38] <megamonmon123> @hussdogrob probably dont do that here. paige wants to be pure
[0:05:41] <+FrostMass22> Saying Detroit is the best Quantic Dream game is like saying there's a best kind of parasite you can have: they're all bad but some are much worse
[0:05:41] <KoyaMusa> is she stalling again
[0:05:43] <+JoeStillLife> LOOP
[0:05:48] <+vinnysuperg123> I just wanna see the tatoo now
[0:05:48] <+TheGershon> 'm pretty sure Paige wants to play it so probably not
[0:05:51] <$GohanEgret> pat and paige teased they would stream Detroit so probably want to keep spoilers to a minimum
[0:05:52] <@thenefftw> Big loop
[0:05:52] <hussdogrob> Thank you!
[0:05:53] <+TheGershon> Oops
[0:05:57] <Psyramics> literally everything we learn about deviants in that game ruins the concept of deviants
[0:06:00] <%ssjklyco> waiting on the Uber Eats driver i bet
[0:06:02] <bum_boi> Am I catching the start or ending to stream? Idk Im in Australia
[0:06:06] <+Toynota10> hallo tonite

[0:46:26] <%TheOnlyStrayCat> pride300 To be fair, I honestly have closer to 6 lives left. I was dark blue for 8 hours when I was born, I fell like 25 feet out of a tree, and got dragged on the concrete alongside my mother's car (which is a LONG story but rest assured it was a dumbass stunt that was everyone's fault), all shit that SHOULD have killed me. So, yeah. 6 lives. But! Still alive! Still Alive.

[1:27:11] <+TMulharin> Should have designed their game better if they didn't want you doing so much damage early
[1:27:11] <%AbnormalVoid> it's always so dumb when you can break the cap, because it's so over powered and removes all challenge
[1:27:11] <+SolidusRex> Certain abilities in FFVIII break the cap.

[1:28:53] <leinadtonu> What's better than mundane Plague?
[1:28:54] <sounata> it was not like this
[1:28:54] <Hal10k> For the record, HowLongToBeat says this game takes 3 hours.
[1:28:54] <Bionicghost> superbly easy
[1:28:54] <+ThatGuyfromMars> yo it wasn't a hard game paige

[1:29:00] <%Kataguro> I was literally 15 and it took me like an afternoon
[1:29:01] <%PatEarthGod> Because I have good spacial reasoning
[1:29:01] <megamonmon123> you are super bad at this for a newbie paige
[1:29:02] <+ruddyredbone> Final fantasy was always bad
[1:29:02] <Piyerus> Maybe a 1 on the frustration scale?
[1:29:02] <SubjectTea> It wasn’t that hard tbh
[1:29:02] <%fangedsniper2nd> Never this bad
[1:29:02] <%Keyd00d> Portal 2 was also easy
[1:29:02] <ProtoShawk> Portal's always been fairly easy
[1:29:02] <%galaxyswirl> CUP OF COFFEE
[1:29:02] <MyNameIsRasus> Never played it
[1:29:02] <+AncientToco> It wasn’t and I was like 10
[1:29:03] <Tooniearcade> It was never this bad
[1:29:03] <@corn_on_fire> it's like a 2-4 hour game
[1:29:04] <Mr_Strut> Cup of coffee in the big time
[1:29:04] <+Lillowh> it wasnt
[1:29:06] <+TheShal> I beat it in my first sitting

[1:29:06] <AlchemiBeast> ignore those boxes
[1:29:07] <PlumpPotatoRump> the goo puzzles were fuked
[1:29:07] <elementofloyalty> FEET
[1:29:09] <+zamatermort> Not frustrating at all Paige
[1:29:09] <emoonimoo> Portal 2 made me feel more stupid than usual
[1:29:09] <$rdark_ksu> portal 2 has some mind benders
[1:29:10] <jayordanny> I can't wait for Paige to play Portal 2
[1:29:12] <+xS1D3SW1P3x> PORTAL 2 COOP WHEN
[1:29:12] <eco419> I Speedrun this :)
[1:29:13] <SGrim> @PeachSaliva my first playthrough was 97 minutes... rooBlank
[1:29:13] <SubjectTea> Portal 2 is more difficult
[1:29:14] <JoshuaGLewis> Cuppp uh cawfee in the big time, yeahhh
[1:29:15] <TLPenn> At least tell her she can pick up turrets.
[1:29:15] <+demon1103> it was a 2 hour game when i was a small child
[1:29:16] <%GeneralSCPatton> It super wasnt!
[1:29:17] <tacostarvedbeast> No, not like this Paige, it was NEVER like this
[1:29:17] <medicaldeviant32> CUP OF COFFEE OHHH YEAH
[1:29:18] <gyrogogozeppeli> Its not LUL
[1:29:19] <VritraReiRei> @PeachSaliva ??? The age of the game has nothing to do with how hard you think the game is...
[1:29:20] <+Cyoctane> She has portals... walks long way
[1:29:20] <%LifesNeverHumDrum> your difficulty is increassed due to having to talk to people paige, so dont feel too bad
[1:29:20] <DigbyMayor> If it's stupid and it works, it's not stupid.
[1:29:21] <Hidashi13> i beat this game in literally 30 minutes
[1:29:21] <gyrogogozeppeli> Portal 2 will break you more
[1:29:22] <%disgracefulking> 300 IQ BOIS HERE
[1:29:22] <elementofloyalty> stop shooting
[1:29:23] <$SleepyMaribo> NO YOU ARENT
[1:29:23] <SwindlerOfProgress> It's OK, Paige, we love you all the same.
[1:29:24] <$KaiserRolled> 2 could get frustrating but not so much 1
[1:29:24] <Baron_von_Turkeyfish> no your not
[1:29:24] <+hoenhime344> yea portal 2 was a head scratcher...
[1:29:24] <+flying_hipp0> Spacial. Awareness.
[1:29:25] <StarSkullyman> Portal 2 took me a full day ngl
[1:29:26] <gandvin> late puzzels in 2 are hard
[1:29:26] <SatansDick1> portal 2 is way better tho
[1:29:27] <imbatman37> now dig down
[1:29:28] <+JoeKer12349> portal 1 is the tech demo for portal 2
[1:29:29] <+tigerfang86> I GUESS PAIGE
[1:29:29] <%HyperCharge_Sam> You can get stuck on one or two puzzles on your first playthrough
[1:29:30] <DiscountChicken> P2 is going to break her mind
[1:29:31] <+tigerfang86> I GUESS
[1:29:31] <mercado94> "good"
[1:29:33] <%supersugoisenpai1> The most frustrating thing about Portal is watching someone else play when you already know the solution
[1:29:33] <superbla25> she drinks radios
[1:29:33] <%Remery_> my dumb sister had problems with this game but she doesn't think alot
[1:29:34] <+JoeStillLife> LUL

[2:26:33] <3viltiki> @PeachSaliva hay is the unused stalk of the wheat plant
[2:26:35] <%konekoryugamine> Why do we always assume Plague can tell us about the goats? Maybe Plague can tell us something about the people who ride the goats. What say you, @PlagueOfGripes ?

[2:50:14] <Nightmarecast> Bloodborne isn't that hard though, it's no Portal.
[2:50:16] <%ssjklyco> @dabirSA That isnt going to mean she will play better
[2:50:16] <Zola390> Detroit is bad for different reasons.

[2:50:30] <+krawtch> i liked Detroit, because I found it hilarious how bad it is at coming across as serious or profound
[2:50:31] <+FrostMass22> I hate the androids so they technically got the best ending
[2:50:31] <%Baesel20xx> Detroit is a good game but a horrible story
[2:50:33] <wsintai> Detroit is bad, but I enjoyed it
[2:50:33] <@thenefftw> Detroit isn't the normal Cage bad
[2:50:34] <+almostcoolperson> Portal is the Dark Souls of videogames
[2:50:35] <elementofloyalty> Matt,Pat n Woolie are dummies for liking Cage game
[2:50:39] <+olliedelosa> Why would someone do that to themselves?

[2:51:43] <+Ssaik> @PeachSaliva Would you ever consider playing Furi? That game is great
[2:51:44] <@corn_on_fire> i'm sure they've blown past her several times by now
[2:51:44] <%Djinnazz> @peach beat the game twice since you started.
[2:51:46] <Zola390> Detroit is a competently told story that hits every single beat you expect it to without doing anything new.
[2:51:53] <elementofloyalty> Kiss you lobe birds
[2:51:54] <eco419> i finish the game
[2:51:55] <SatansDick1> this was scripted right....right

[2:52:19] <CrypticMochi> Godhand Paige
[2:52:22] <+TheArrow_> I was gonna be the father :)
[2:52:22] <+krawtch> the plot of God Hand holds itself together better than Detroit
[2:52:23] <dabirSA> @ssjklyco i honestly think the puzzle is going to be incredibly frustrating and tedious to execute even if she figures it out immediately
[2:52:26] <elementofloyalty> FULL

[3:04:40] <Da1TruPhoenix> she's does esports hosting and stuff now i think
[3:04:43] <+AncelDeLambert> Like all Telltale games, Puzzle agent is too short and the episodic format makes it weaker
[3:04:51] <elementofloyalty> that again
[3:04:56] <bryanmildew> hard to follow that
[3:04:57] <KTDelgado> shes one of the older content creators back then like ray william johnson
[3:04:57] <$NaotoKozuki> I could do taht
[3:05:01] <CurrySauseBandit> It's not actually that impressive. I can do it ._.
[3:05:07] <dabirSA> iirc at the time she was kind of pushed but didn't really seem like she deserved to be? idk been ages
