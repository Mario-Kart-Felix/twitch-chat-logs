[1:35:45] <+NecDW4> @PeachSaliva Does Pat know that lighting the torches/carrying a torch increases the agro range in here, because enemies can see you better?
[1:35:48] <@Jekado> they are seeing at a higher resolution then us because stream can only up at 1080p60fps
[1:35:48] <moonlitdream> JUMP ACROSS
[1:35:51] <maskedpirate28> a lot of variables at play here
[1:35:53] <@SoFarFetched> Careful of the black holes Paige.
[1:35:53] <+Mendin> Not only is this darkness, but this is DARKNESS MAZE
[1:35:55] <studleydoorite> that poison spitting statue will return more powerful than you could ever imagine

[1:36:19] <+badchoice5> @PeachSaliva Havel's Armor tho
[1:36:21] <+Chewygamer> missed legendary weapon PepeLaugh
[1:36:24] <lotharrio> Maybe a nice crossbow but that's about all that's left unless she decides to become a caster.
[1:36:32] <+patriotrenegade> @PeachSaliva I hate the heartbeat in this area
[1:36:34] <%optimasmaximas> sipsipElmo
[1:36:37] <%depressed_skeleton> that is a nice song
[1:36:45] <alvaroeltz> Doenst the gutter have havel's armor, or it changed in sotfs?
[1:36:48] <+Mendin> Still want her to use the Smelter Hammer for biggest and stronkest
[1:36:56] <%optimasmaximas> LUL
[1:37:01] <DamnGoodCake> PRO TIP: YOU CAN SWING YOUR TORCH AT THE POISON STATUES
[1:37:01] <%j0ustar> LUL
[1:37:05] <%maenos2> paige HOW MANY of this have you played?
[1:37:07] <%maenos2> its a GHOST
[1:37:12] <Jolly_Adventurer> @alvaroeltz I think it still does
[1:37:12] <%UvBenServed> Spooky ghost
[1:37:13] <Coystick> G-g-g-ghost!!
[1:37:15] <$YourBuddyBodhi> spooky ghost
[1:37:20] <@SoFarFetched> @alvaroeltz It's t here, it's behind a door that you get a key for later.
[1:37:24] <%walternatorz> are you able to see ghosts if you're not able to be invaded?
[1:37:25] <+cdrom321> @DamnGoodCake What's the advantage vs the sword?
[1:37:26] <$Sphincter_Spelunker> she is gonna die so much in the DLC
[1:37:26] <+patriotrenegade> Havel's armor is in the Gutter but you need the Forgotten Key
[1:37:27] <rosemon5001> OOOoooooOOOOooo spoooky ghosties
[1:37:30] <%depressed_skeleton> Boo!
[1:37:33] <serrishtar> i cant believe she realized its not a new bonfire
[1:37:35] <+Valask> what
[1:37:38] <Owkono> these naked men are dangerous
[1:37:43] <jimmytwofeet> RUNNING JUMP TIME
[1:37:43] <$YourBuddyBodhi> the ghost of Lincoln would be rad
[1:37:46] <@SoFarFetched> Yeah Key is like sometime later.
[1:37:47] <%Th3SmartAlec> oh no
[1:37:48] <@Calek> havels set is later
[1:37:48] <+badchoice5> Peach beat Orphan
[1:37:48] <$YourBuddyBodhi> that guy was ripped
[1:37:49] <%Remery_> did she call Lincoln sexy?
[1:37:51] <islandsunn> jump
[1:37:54] <studleydoorite> if the screen was darker she could pretend she has Havel's
[1:37:55] <%spiritofmojave> no dragon tooth yet? daww
[1:37:56] <DamnGoodCake> @cdrom321 swings faster, less likely to hit a wall and clank off, also if the statue is on her left side its easier to hit
[1:37:56] <%depressed_skeleton> falls
[1:37:58] <@Calek> the key is literally in the next area
[1:37:58] <$YourBuddyBodhi> fellas is Abraham Lincoln sexy
[1:38:00] <+Chewygamer> havels isnt even good in this game
[1:38:00] <@SoFarFetched> also she needs a shit ton of strength to wear it.
[1:38:04] <@Calek> so like 3 streams from now
[1:38:04] <%Lunarhawk> that was a risky angle
[1:38:04] <islandsunn> ayyy
[1:38:06] <%oda_flobunaga> If not Lincoln, then who, Old Godzilla?
[1:38:07] <+Chewygamer> monkaS

[1:52:38] <Admiral_PopnFresh> ALL THAT I SEE
[1:52:38] <MetalSlimeHunt> Because all of Bloodborne's actual difficulty is in psyching out traumatized Dark Souls players. If you just thrash wildly like Paige it's easy as it comes.
[1:52:40] <wannabemoogle> I want Paige to call her doctor crying about needing them to prescribe more adderal for the video game

[2:03:10] <$DesertPenguin> Yea, I did the same lol
[2:03:12] <%optimasmaximas> ds3 is so good
[2:03:13] <TechGamer> Honestly it's been too long not continuing this
[2:03:14] <$Hylian726> Majula theme kinda sucks tho tbh
[2:03:14] <Coystick> DS3=Souless
[2:03:14] <%Lunarhawk> No one cares about DS3
[2:03:15] <%arran_throttle> ELMO
[2:03:15] <+patriotrenegade> polay the DLC coward
[2:03:16] <@Calek> DS3 is ok
[2:03:16] <%darcfowler1995> I love the music really relaxing
[2:03:17] <$DesertPenguin> Went back to DS1 actually, then DS4
[2:03:18] <%Lunarhawk> All that Matters if Elden Ring
[2:03:18] <$DesertPenguin> DS3*
[2:03:19] <$YourBuddyBodhi> is ds3 really the shit
[2:03:19] <+Chewygamer> DS 3 is pretty good
[2:03:21] <ECRead> Jojo modded DS3
[2:03:21] <DatAsuna> Majula best hub
[2:03:23] <%SvenHolgersson> DS3 is great except for the FUCKING POISE LIE
[2:03:23] <+demon1103> Majula is my fav hub....too bad its in DS2
[2:03:25] <+SaphronBlackbourne> Don't ever play DS2 again it's not worth it
[2:03:25] <$DesertPenguin> Cuz it's boring
[2:03:26] <$Sphincter_Spelunker> It's boring in 1
[2:03:26] <%SvenHolgersson> I WILL DIE MAD
[2:03:27] <SpaceCatStation> I get an urge to play DS2 again but then remember how much I hated Scholar of the First Sin
[2:03:28] <DXLelouch24> DS3 has ANIME moves
[2:03:28] <Aydarkzero> cause sorcery is lame
[2:03:28] <zamzoph> Magic SUCKS
[2:03:28] <%spiritofmojave> DS3 is aiight
[2:03:28] <$DesertPenguin> Magic is so boring
[2:03:30] <%heartlesshealer> pat fucking up the build for real is the best joke 👏
[2:03:30] <+nekodelic> DS3 is the only good one
[2:03:31] <valriot> Sorcery is busted in DS1
[2:03:32] <+SaphronBlackbourne> I hate this game but I love watching it
[2:03:35] <spoiledbadger> Try the Cinder's Mod on DS3
[2:03:36] <coreyyotto> DS1 sorcery is super viable
[2:03:36] <+MeMillionthDollar> Magic is for losers
[2:03:37] <scrublord009> Sorcery is for chumps Kappa
[2:03:37] <%dashdodger> DS3 is great
[2:03:38] <+SarcFa> but DS1 is when sorcery was actually strong
[2:03:38] <Aydarkzero> Hex user WutFace
[2:03:39] <%AncelDeLambert> sorcery is GREAT at high levels
[2:03:39] <$DesertPenguin> Pyro is cool
[2:03:40] <%rdark_ksu> Ever do theif?
[2:03:40] <audrus> no spelling for pat
[2:03:41] <$Sphincter_Spelunker> Sorc build is just more projectiles
[2:03:41] <%JJCheeker> I like the character creator music in this game
[2:03:42] <%luftraumm1> I gave up on ds3 nameless king
[2:03:42] <+patriotrenegade> Hex is great
[2:03:42] <%AncelDeLambert> you get NUKE spells
[2:03:43] <+badchoice5> HEX IS SO GOOD
[2:03:44] <lotharrio> I normally do dex+faith. Can't get into Sorcery.
[2:03:44] <+Mendin> Daughters of Ash mod for DS1
[2:03:45] <+Yolikialiaco> sorcery in ds3 is garbage
[2:03:47] <Sunstalker> Pyromancy is basically sorcery
[2:03:47] <Will_The_Soulless> You ever think about doing a modded playthrough of that DS3 Cinders modpack Pat?
[2:03:48] <$TrashLeviathan> a hecks run
[2:03:48] <%UvBenServed> Remember when lightning spears were the shit in DS2?
[2:03:49] <$DesertPenguin> Quality is great in DS1
[2:03:49] <Baeltyr> ds3 is the only game ive done sorc faith or pyro runs in
[2:03:49] <+Chewygamer> hex is OP
[2:03:50] <audrus> not a single word socrcelled
[2:03:50] <Explodincatz> i leave for 10min and Pat stole the controller
[2:03:50] <Ashenik1> pat maybe try Sekiro
[2:03:51] <+Mitchellsocks> I've been trying to do a DS3 sorcery run, but it's ended up with me just crystal enhancing my Claymore and brawling it out anyway
[2:03:51] <jobbedbone> dirty hex users
[2:03:52] <SMuffinMan> DS3 has best bosses FREE
[2:03:52] <$YourBuddyBodhi> i didnt enjoy ds1 or 3 in the long run
[2:03:52] <Coystick> Sorcery is awesome in DS2 blue flame sword and Spellshield for ultimate GISH
[2:03:53] <cosmicgoatee> elden ring sorcery runs are gonna definately be a thing and I cant wait
[2:03:53] <%mrshazboto> Did they ever fix faith builds in DS2?
[2:03:54] <maskedpirate28> I did sorcery and then quality in DS3
[2:03:54] <$Hylian726> Faith was fun in DS2 before they accidentally nerfed it to oblivion and never fixed it
[2:03:54] <katocrimson> old ds1 speed runs were socery runs
[2:03:54] <chambatron> I always did a STR run with the first axe on Bloodborne like a fucking chad
[2:03:55] <legacy0117> Dark Souls II has a lot of depth, and DLC just adds to it in so many ways.
[2:03:55] <Valdorick> Dirty hex user
[2:03:55] <+Mendin> Daughters of Ash for DA1 is a really good rebuild
[2:03:56] <$Sphincter_Spelunker> against enemies who are resistant to magic
[2:03:56] <+comfyman12> DS3 is so annoying that I had to use sorcerer to make it bearable
[2:04:00] <+SaphronBlackbourne> I've been doing sorcery in all 3 games
[2:04:00] <$Sphincter_Spelunker> which is most
[2:04:00] <+blademaster247> Magic sucks until it doesn't. At which point it breaks the game. Not fun to play though
[2:04:01] <HumanGiant13> This makes me want to replay Demon’s souls
[2:04:02] <drewslo> sorcerery in ds2 is actually fun
[2:04:04] <Aydarkzero> @mrshazboto HA no
[2:04:05] <Valdorick> I was a faith build, I got nerfed to shit
[2:04:06] <Srthunda> There is alot of magic in this game that is really cool
[2:04:08] <YakumoYomi> DS3 has mods that give it some aspects of Bloodborne
[2:04:08] <@Calek> @Ashenik1 check his youtube channel
[2:04:08] <SMuffinMan> DS3 has the best bosses FREE
[2:04:10] <%heartlesshealer> Pat, tell Paige about cuffs if she puts on big sword again
[2:04:15] <Berendenn> Blue Flame sorcery is fucking great
[2:04:17] <scrublord009> CHAT WAR LUl
[2:04:19] <Admiral_PopnFresh> my dex/int in 2 and all magic in 3 were great fun
[2:04:20] <scrublord009> LUL
[2:04:20] <%AncelDeLambert> ... fair'nuff
[2:04:24] <jobbedbone> 3
[2:04:24] <%baronblank> maybe it's because I played it last, but ds3 was the only one I had no real interest in replaying after beating it
[2:04:24] <$YourBuddyBodhi> Bloodborne is the clear best
[2:04:24] <+badchoice5> I love playing the mage, except in DS1 and DS#
[2:04:26] <Aydarkzero> i love the MP bar man
[2:04:26] <%heartlesshealer> HEAVY
[2:04:27] <DamnGoodCake> DS3
[2:04:27] <%luftraumm1> best souls game is bloodborne
[2:04:27] <$DesertPenguin> Pat, Why don't you check out the popular mods for DS1 and DS3?
[2:04:28] <+Yolikialiaco> what is paige's soul level
[2:04:28] <%AncelDeLambert> DS3
[2:04:29] <Valdorick> The paper casting is great in 1 and 2
[2:04:31] <+SarcFa> magic is trash in DS3 period, unless you invest in it for 90% of the game with pay off in maybe the last 5% of the game
[2:04:32] <+D00msDayDan> same, i never used weapon arts because WHAT IF I NEED IT LATER
[2:04:32] <+Mr_Pylon> 3
[2:04:33] <%darcfowler1995> Yeah me neither the MP system sucks for this game type
[2:04:34] <+Mitchellsocks> Bloodborne best EZ
[2:04:34] <%heartlesshealer> CUFFS
[2:04:34] <+Caidezes> Try the Cinders mod for DS3 then.
[2:04:35] <CappuccinoGuil> INT IS JUST BLUE DEX LET'S GO
[2:04:35] <audrus> 3
[2:04:36] <jobbedbone> forget NUMBER
[2:04:36] <maskedpirate28> I liked it a lot more than the previous magic systems
[2:04:38] <+Chewygamer> demon souls MP system
[2:04:40] <+badchoice5> DS2 has an ok feeling magic system, if you are hexing
[2:04:41] <Will_The_Soulless> Cinders is fantastic
[2:04:42] <+SaphronBlackbourne> I was mage in 1 and had a grand old time
[2:04:42] <ECRead> remember when faith builds were viable for like 3 months? good times
[2:04:44] <+theobble> but i bet you fucking loved it in demon's souls
[2:04:44] <Zombrocom> I liked it
[2:04:45] <%dekkitout> God, Cinders is so good
[2:04:48] <Valdorick> DS3, the game where heavy soul arrow is the best spell, because its the most damage per MP
[2:04:48] <%AncelDeLambert> the quality builds in DS3 are great, tho
[2:04:49] <Aydarkzero> O P T I M I Z E D
[2:04:50] <spoiledbadger> There's a Mod called Cinder's that you can level up at the bonfire and adds fp regen'
[2:04:52] <malesin_01> because mind goblins say bar no full
[2:04:55] <$DesertPenguin> I wish we got mods on PS4
[2:04:56] <+patriotrenegade> Limited spell uses suck tho
[2:04:59] <audrus> equop
[2:05:00] <%ShichiNoBushi> Do you prefer the spell slots of the previous games? I thought you didn't like Vancian magic.
[2:05:03] <%heartlesshealer> Pat =T
[2:05:03] <Valdorick> never use ANY OTHER SPELL, because they prevent you from using Heavy Soul Arrow
[2:05:04] <%darcfowler1995> Having a limited number of spells is way better and actually makes you think
[2:05:09] <+RedMaskBandit> DS1 and DS3 wee really fun for spell and miracle builds until they get nerfed to oblivion
[2:05:10] <CappuccinoGuil> I once did a Magical Girl build in DS1. All sorceries, miracles, pyromancies and hexes.
[2:05:12] <$YourBuddyBodhi> Vancian Magic is fine yall are just babey
[2:05:14] <Baeltyr> @ECRead viable? you mean the most busted shit that exists? yea those were good times :P
[2:05:14] <EuropanLamprey> its actually way better since your not limited to two css
[2:05:16] <+cdrom321> Pat, are you leading toward Fume greatsword?
[2:05:18] <%mrshazboto> But paaaaat. What if she wants another weaaaapoooon
[2:05:19] <Valdorick> Vancian magic is the BEST
[2:05:21] <%Kirby_Sauce> Cheer200 hey there ginger twerks, I'm on the bus and I got some guy yelling at me here. My crime? Facing his general direction. I'm the one with a mask on. Not him though. WHY?
[2:05:24] <$DesertPenguin> With all the mods, does DS1 Izalith lava still look awful?
[2:05:26] <$YourBuddyBodhi> VANCIAN MAGIC GANG
[2:05:26] <$Agami23> get paige the greatclub
[2:05:28] <ECRead> yeah exactly
[2:05:30] <Aydarkzero> i dont mind either system i just like seeing a MP bar
[2:05:30] <NaturalGear> mp's are kind of necessary for pure magic builds though
[2:05:33] <$YourBuddyBodhi> SPELL SLOT GANG
[2:05:36] <$Hylian726> CappuccinoGuil hexes in ds1 Kappa
[2:05:36] <+Yolikialiaco> @valdorick real shit. stuff like that made homeward useless
[2:05:40] <@SoFarFetched> think that was my set f or most of the game too
[2:05:41] <%JJCheeker> Peach poop
[2:05:46] <DamnGoodCake> @PeachSaliva PAT GO TURN ON THE HERO STONE THINGY
[2:05:46] <katocrimson> wat is pyro girl wearing?
[2:05:47] <+badchoice5> and simple
[2:05:48] <+trustycoyote> Yeah but you look goofy
[2:05:48] <+waltzqueen> FASHION
[2:05:49] <%luftraumm1> kinda boring tho
[2:05:52] <zamzoph> @PeachSaliva has Paige EVER used the shield?
[2:05:52] <%dekkitout> @DesertPenguin No mod fixes Izalith's badness
[2:05:53] <@SoFarFetched> Until I started switching to HAvel
[2:05:53] <Monkeyweed21> Baby's first strength build
[2:05:54] <jimmytwofeet> WHERE IS PEACHU-SAMA
[2:05:54] <+badchoice5> it's an easy play style
[2:05:55] <legacy0117> The characters are a bunch of characteratures, but they develop a lot over time.
[2:05:59] <%oda_flobunaga> Sooo, Endless Space?
[2:06:00] <%Teintstein> I think peach fell in the terlet
[2:06:07] <$YourBuddyBodhi> Soul Greatsword and Farron Flashsword is lit
[2:06:08] <lotharrio> I think I wore the Alonne set with a miracle-hood. Gave me a pretty sweet paladin look.

[2:06:42] <Owkono> pat stares at list
[2:06:43] <$YourBuddyBodhi> bra=OFF
[2:06:44] <%heartlesshealer> it would be cool if brains worked well enough for people to make their master lists
[2:06:45] <zamzoph> Pat can beat the whole game in the time she's gone
[2:06:45] <maskedpirate28> that would be a super long list. Maybe just top 50 or something
[2:06:46] <+YseCrack> Dumps like a truck

[2:06:47] <%optimasmaximas> @PeachSaliva god of war?

[2:43:42] <codycurry52> Ah I see
[2:43:43] <+cdrom321> @SinisterBroccoli Early on, Pat said that they're skipping Dark Lurker.
[2:43:44] <%UvBenServed> Some sick armor
[2:43:46] <+AbnormalVoid> her brother, Cockatiel
[2:43:48] <Srthunda> we will only see darklurker if paige allows hand holding
[2:43:50] <the_vainglory> Lucatiel and Paige are both Sundowning.
[2:43:51] <$SinisterBroccoli> cdrom321 gotcha
[2:43:51] <+shinydemonguy> look at how fast i can hollow!
[2:43:51] <+tigerfang86> the SICKEST BROTHER EVER......

[2:44:02] <%Lunarhawk> i swear
[2:44:07] <PraiseHemra> BibleThump BibleThump
[2:44:10] <Admiral_PopnFresh> So DaS2 seems to be the only game in which people seem aware of their mental degredation
[2:44:12] <%RedMageRebel> shes my fave part of DS2 to be honest
[2:44:12] <freelancebabymaker> what are these jerking off noises in the background
[2:44:15] <Melchior_the_Wise> Did we get to Smelter demon yet?
[2:44:16] <%JenovasPuppet> Yeah, Lucatiel elevates DS2 single handedly.
[2:44:18] <Monkeyweed21> you get her hat and outfit if you do her quest @PeachSaliva
[2:44:19] <chancho4tierra> paige sundown ages ago
[2:44:22] <+Estuko> Now make out with her
[2:44:24] <%Lunarhawk> @Melchior_the_Wise nope
[2:44:26] <Garthunox> lucatiel is the most boring, flaccid character
[2:44:30] <$Sphincter_Spelunker> Paige, what did Lucatiel say? Repeat it back
[2:44:31] <%JenovasPuppet> "Leave the mask on..."
[2:44:34] <FacetiousAF> sun is down, adderall is gone, paige is strongbig
[2:44:35] <@PlagueOfGripes> Lucatiel's rationale is really flimsy
[2:44:44] <+Jasek7> paige needs a sundial...
[2:44:49] <Duskendawn> I can feel every death make pat hollow out instead
[2:44:50] <%JenovasPuppet> What souls?
[2:44:52] <+Chewygamer> she wants to find her brother whats so flimsy about that
[2:44:54] <DamnGoodCake> homeward bone, save the headache
[2:44:58] <@PlagueOfGripes> "No one saw my brother one day so I came to this magic land because he's probably here maybe I guess or not"
[2:44:58] <%Tucker0603> @peachsaliva her sign will be near the second bonfire
[2:45:06] <%TigerCatGo> WHAT ARE THOSE
[2:45:07] <@SoFarFetched> @Sphincter_Spelunker She pretty much tells you her memories are starting to fade more and wonders if her brother ended up here since she is looking for him.
[2:45:12] <ALTRNico> effigy first
[2:45:14] <Baconrath> wont that spike on her hat make it hard to go into enclosed spaces
[2:45:16] <%JenovasPuppet> Effigy tho

[2:45:32] <$Sphincter_Spelunker> @SoFarFetched I was more so asking for her comprehension as she retains little to nothing
[2:45:33] <TheGrimmHuntsman> Might want to beat the invader and statues first. Otherwise she might die before making it to the boss.
[2:45:34] <PraiseHemra> watch her die intsantly
[2:45:37] <@PlagueOfGripes> now use 75 effigies in an effort to keep summoning this lady

[2:45:47] <%Chichen> Ms Monopoly
[2:45:48] <Phob05> "I'm sure he walked into that big whirlpool too. All the cool kids are doing it!"

[2:48:21] <+Lizard0TM> The boss isn't even hard
[2:48:22] <+badchoice5> @PeachSaliva If you have Lucatiel to distract the Rotten, use your Greatsword 2 handed
[2:48:22] <$DesertPenguin> Someone will give you more eventually
[2:48:23] <DatAsuna> You have so many effigis anyway
[2:48:23] <codycurry52> YOU HAVE 60
[2:48:23] <+Jasek7> i love that chat just knows "body explosion"
[2:48:24] <supersparta12345> You can get more. They're not that important
[2:48:24] <+Mendin> Suggestion: Use Lucatiel to help fight Woodland Child Fuckboi while you're here?
[2:48:25] <%crowsloft77> She beat bloodborne
[2:48:26] <%arran_throttle> OH NOOO! SHE HAS ONLY 63
[2:48:26] <Sunstalker> SwindlerOfProgress they respawn. And the ones in the boss fight don't do anything
[2:48:27] <%juxtest> Oh thats an invader
[2:48:28] <DatAsuna> THIS IS ALL THEY ARE GOOD FOR
[2:48:28] <+xBolts4Lifex> how the hell do you have 62 effigies!?
[2:48:28] <peachy996> is it really worth for a d-tier waifus quest?

[2:48:29] <+TheFabledAble> why is your weapon so lame and does no damage :0
[2:48:29] <jobbedbone> DYING TO ROTWHEEL
[2:48:31] <%sharpington_> @PeachSaliva If Peach breaks the statues each time she won't have to start the fight poisoned
[2:48:31] <%JJCheeker> Got 60 left I hope that's enough
[2:48:32] <+cdrom321> She only has 60 of them.
[2:48:33] <%spiritofmojave> You'll hopefully do it in under 60 attempts
[2:48:34] <%TalisKanju> So Pat is going to take another week off?

[2:48:39] <cosmicgoatee> she. beat. BLOODBORNE.
[2:48:41] <DatAsuna> IT'S THE WHOLE POINT OF EFFIGIES
[2:48:42] <+tigerfang86> remember when she beat the bloodbornes guys
[2:48:43] <$Sphincter_Spelunker> but what if she needs effigies later
[2:48:43] <$DesertPenguin> Can you put fire on your weapon?
[2:48:44] <cellularmishap> Paige, it will NOT take you 61 attempts.
[2:48:45] <BeefyQueefer> If Paige uses 60 effigies on one boss I'm going to fucking puke
[2:48:45] <$DesertPenguin> Do that
[2:48:45] <Cory_the_Dinosaur> the greatsword is great
[2:48:46] <%twistedj3ster> noooo
[2:48:47] <thesickestzak> Just win 4Head
[2:48:47] <DamnGoodCake> @PeachSaliva use the greatsword, more dmg, and lucca can distract
[2:48:48] <coreyyotto> Hammer seems better right now
[2:48:48] <DatAsuna> No normal player would have 60
[2:48:49] <Garthunox> @plagueofgripes all effigies used
[2:48:49] <+Jasek7> you should use w/e if it makes you not terrible

[3:10:16] <SomeSageAdvice> Gavlan is the only person you can sell stuff to in the whole game
[3:10:18] <supersparta12345> Just use life gem, it basically counteracts poison
[3:10:19] <BionicPulga> Pat's happy now, lol.
[3:10:22] <Aydarkzero> Poison arrows though PogChamp
[3:10:23] <%QueequegTheater> @peachsaliva The bloodstains are from people stocking up with him and immediately dying to poison

[3:10:34] <%JenovasPuppet> It improves his inventory? FUCK I been doing it wrong...

[3:10:53] <WhitePantherZ> why not use life gems rather than estus? @peachsaliva
[3:10:55] <calamarvelous> Paige got a rock
[3:10:56] <+FrenchTact1cs> A rock
[3:10:58] <peachy996> Please don't ask why in Dark Souls
[3:10:58] <+Jaysky> Gavlan don't deal with chests, he only deal with wheel @Captain_Doomsday
[3:11:02] <Sunstalker> JenovasPuppet I don't remember but I think it did, just like the other merchant
[3:11:03] <+eggstyr0ne> has pat seen the new Total war Warhammer dlc?
[3:11:03] <canadadan55> I got a rock
[3:11:03] <DamnGoodCake> There is more to the cave, GO DOWN
[3:11:04] <+Grayhammatter> there may be a ring below
[3:11:06] <BeefyQueefer> Pat deserves that extra week off.
[3:11:06] <%QueequegTheater> No
[3:11:08] <+FxyDEV> poisonbite doesnt work on areas
[3:11:08] <lotharrio> Regen ring might be useful right now
[3:11:10] <+cdrom321> Poinson bite ring, and it's never that effective.
[3:11:11] <+FrenchTact1cs> Yes
[3:11:13] <canadadan55> yes
[3:11:13] <+ragingbrachy> gulp gulp gulp
[3:11:13] <karanoyoukai> yes if you wear the bleach ring the poison meter go down
[3:11:14] <THELava_lad> ITS FUKIN RAW
[3:11:15] <@SoFarFetched> @WhitePantherZ estus you can freely refill at bonfires,lifegems you either have to buy or get off enemies.
[3:11:24] <+patriotrenegade> Poisonbite ring, but its in the DLC
[3:11:25] <DKthundah> Oh I thought he had the giant ring
[3:11:27] <SnaKemuho> Gavlan sells grass for that I think
[3:11:33] <DKthundah> Or something like that
[3:11:35] <lotharrio> She's near full humanity, putting on the regen ring would help.
[3:11:36] <$Sphincter_Spelunker> drop your menu
[3:11:37] <%sharpington_> But scorpion guy isn't a foe at all
[3:11:39] <Captain_Doomsday> Paige got the ring from Gavlan, right?
[3:11:39] <+Jaysky> I hear if you injest fishtank water you can prevent the poison
[3:11:40] <cosmicgoatee> it's edibles paige

[3:42:10] <Zaphire_Saucypants> Hurt!
[3:42:11] <%SvenHolgersson> Logan was the only good X-Men movie outside of Deadpool (technically)
[3:42:16] <%Lunarhawk> 100% DS2
[3:42:16] <%Man_in_the_Red> He's dreaming of a better franchise
[3:42:17] <NiktenKing> It's alright
[3:42:19] <+RD_nx> 3
[3:42:20] <DamnGoodCake> DS3 = easiest
[3:42:21] <lotharrio> Bloodborne is super easy to get into.
[3:42:22] <$YourBuddyBodhi> One of the best movies of the last five years, legit study that shit for cinematography and screenwriting
[3:42:22] <$Sphincter_Spelunker> Bloodborne can be easy
[3:42:24] <%spiritofmojave> 3 for sure
[3:42:24] <+xBolts4Lifex> 3
[3:42:26] <connorussell> 3
[3:42:26] <Valdorick> 3 is honestly kinda easy
[3:42:27] <@Calek> easiest is Demon's Souls, they just get more complicated as the series goes on
[3:42:28] <zamzoph> the last one you played is always the easiest
[3:42:29] <+Grayhammatter> 3
[3:42:29] <Prevot> bloodborne is big easy
[3:42:30] <Neo_Kaiser> DS2 is the easiest to figure out
[3:42:31] <Balay123> 3 is easiest for sho
[3:42:32] <Melchior_the_Wise> 1 or 3
[3:42:33] <+Nikopol1717> 3
[3:42:33] <%Keyd00d> 3 no question
[3:42:34] <%Ynkubus18> ds2 is easy, ds2 dlc is hard
[3:42:34] <%worldbrand> 3's pretty damn easy even though you can STATS your way through 2
[3:42:35] <+conradical> 2
[3:42:35] <+Fatmanjoggin> does demon's count?
[3:42:36] <Bouerd> vanilla 3
[3:42:47] <%DrFaustMD> now is 3 only easy because you played 2 others
[3:42:48] <peyodogo> bloodborne is hard IF you've gotten your brain rotted into dark souls turtling
[3:42:50] <+WhereIsWill> 3
[3:42:50] <%Man_in_the_Red> @svenholgersson i dont know, First Class and DoFP are good and great
[3:42:50] <marsghoul> 3
[3:42:52] <DamnGoodCake> 3 you get so big so fast, so easy
[3:42:53] <Valdorick> 1 if you get SUPER lucky on the first Black Knight (or any black knight) can get stupid easy too
[3:42:57] <Captain_Doomsday> 3's the only one I finished, but I never played 1 and got tired of 2
[3:42:58] <TheArrow_> demon's has some BULLSHIT though
[3:43:00] <+RedMaskBandit> 3 is easy folliwed by bloodborne
[3:43:04] <Animorphimagi> Not demons
[3:43:04] <%Man_in_the_Red> X1-3 i understand despising
[3:43:07] <%mostundesired> WORKING AS INTENDED

[3:43:27] <$YourBuddyBodhi> feelsbad
[3:43:28] <Sunstalker> YOU HIT A BLACKSMITH? FUCK YOUR SAVE
[3:43:30] <%Skelegroove> 2 is super easy if you have beaten it before
[3:43:43] <Melchior_the_Wise> Consistently hardest is 2
[3:43:43] <$YourBuddyBodhi> 2 has some REAL STRATS
[3:43:50] <%spiritofmojave> 2 has some major artificial difficulty put into it
[3:43:50] <%RedMageRebel> 2s the only one I've beaten tbh
[3:43:51] <$Sphincter_Spelunker> 2 also has ADP, which I didn't know what it did

[3:44:42] <+TheFabledAble> Dark Souls 2 has the craziest difficulty discrepancies between build types in any of the games. If you play the game as a hex build you fucking WALK through content
[3:44:42] <squirtkitten> cant believe Otzdarva did it hitless KEKW
[3:44:43] <DamnGoodCake> Lud and Zallen...

[3:44:46] <+textandnumbers> just be lame and summon npcs
[3:44:46] <DatAsuna> but yeah the run is worse than the boss

[3:44:52] <SMuffinMan> I beat them!
[3:44:52] <Valdorick> @PeachSaliva Imagine Black Glutch, with its cliffs and shit, but a blizzard causing a white out
[3:44:52] <+thehollow89> turn up your brightness
[3:44:53] <Bouerd> i loved invading people there
[3:44:54] <Monkeyweed21> invasions in that are HILARIOUS
[3:44:54] <mdsmith> I did it once.
[3:44:55] <+demon1103> 2 is filled with artificial difficulty that makes you want to break things, 1 is difficult but "fair"...usually
[3:44:56] <alwayspronking> worse than BLIGHTTOWN?!
[3:44:57] <+conradical> yiff
[3:44:57] <Zeikier> yeah try it, then never speak of it again ol
[3:44:57] <karanoyoukai> hosefuck?
[3:44:59] <Djinnazz> possibly the worst boss run in jistory.
[3:45:00] <DatAsuna> Use summons on that one
[3:45:02] <%Man_in_the_Red> Shulva is the shit, but that winter Hellscape
[3:45:02] <+textandnumbers> they're pvp bosses so you can summon
[3:45:06] <DamnGoodCake> @Skelegroove really?? that's me w/ DS3
[3:45:06] <%Lunarhawk> kill that man
[3:45:07] <SMuffinMan> It sucks tho
[3:45:08] <a_mad_dragon> you kill the horses until they stop spawning, that's how
[3:45:09] <%Man_in_the_Red> OOF
[3:45:12] <%SaphronBlackbourne> I deleted my save after uninstalling DS2 so I'd never even think about returning to it
[3:45:12] <+Shacklebox> forget to block more, it only makes me HARDED
[3:45:12] <%Lunarhawk> rip his guts out and wrap it around his face so he has a mask
[3:45:13] <+cdrom321> Those bosses are all about the punishing runs to them.
[3:45:14] <EuropanLamprey> Pat, those two tigers are just Alva but two of them and one heals, you might as well say you beat them
[3:45:15] <karanoyoukai> nyc is a fucked up city,
[3:45:15] <+MrAtheGreat> Horse dick valley, where the dicks are big and your ass is small.
[3:45:18] <Neo_Kaiser> Just watch MauLers 14 hour video on Dark Souls 2. He explains why DS2 is the easiest.
[3:45:19] <%depressed_skeleton> At least you guys have masks, In australia they're like "nah fuck that shit"
[3:45:22] <$Sphincter_Spelunker> If you were dressed as a clown, maybe you looked at him funny
[3:45:26] <Melchior_the_Wise> @alwayspronking way worse than Blight town, Blight town is a joke compared to that spot
[3:45:28] <wsintai> It's New York, everyone is on hard drugs
[3:45:29] <$Agami23> people are boycotting costco because they are enforcing the rules of wear a god damn mask
[3:45:29] <Valdorick> Crazy people are crazy.
[3:45:30] <$YourBuddyBodhi> Sharp Chin + Sharp Eyes = Mean Muggin
[3:45:31] <%depressed_skeleton> did you stop staring @PeachSaliva ?
[3:45:31] <+RD_nx> go there anyways to get lucatil's hat, but fuck the twin tigers

[3:45:50] <%ssjklyco> Just wear sunglasses and say you're blind
[3:45:51] <+Shacklebox> it's because paige has an antagonistic soul
[3:45:51] <karanoyoukai> just do the ahegao, they'll stop complaining
[3:45:52] <%GohanHitsugaya> Maybe because you're a ginger?
[3:45:53] <+bear_breaker20> stop giving people fuck me eyes in public
[3:45:55] <Andrizzleton> she could sense your baby killing
[3:45:55] <DamnGoodCake> crazy attracts crazy
[3:45:56] <@SoFarFetched> I also attracted the creepos on the bus.
[3:45:58] <%ItsRatman> Maybe you just look really mean to other crazy people?
[3:46:00] <lotharrio> She felt your hatred and bloodlust for women.

[3:46:03] <%Th3SmartAlec> LUL
[3:46:04] <%SvenHolgersson> She saw the bloodlust in your eyes

[3:52:36] <Prevot> did you both try to purchase a pass at the same time?
[3:52:37] <%mostundesired> Woolie introduced everyone to everyone.

[3:54:59] <+logoth_> Sonic 3 and Knuckles
[3:55:01] <+KongolComet> amazing OST though
[3:55:02] <+Invlux> Paige should play Robo Blast 2
[3:55:02] <$Sphincter_Spelunker> She reads Sonic, not play it
[3:55:02] <%mighty_max_t> I've only played Sonic Colors....I think
[3:55:03] <Captain_Doomsday> Best Sonic game is Sonic CD because the opening is Sonic Boom.
[3:55:04] <+RealThiele> sonic adventure world 1, then shut game off
[3:55:04] <$YourBuddyBodhi> Sonic 2
[3:55:17] <MattoBii> Sonic 2 or Sonic Mania
[3:55:20] <+Grayhammatter> sonic mania
