[0:17:46] <DXLelouch24> To beat said goblin
[0:17:53] <whittacre> it's a combination of materia & the sphere grid
[0:17:55] <valriot> Its like when you open the bonus maps in Hyrule Warriors and just have a panic attack
[0:18:04] <%MarylandJutsu> does something support your spine?
[0:18:22] <ergulor> don't fortget to re equip your chest
[0:18:28] <DXLelouch24> Or when we all start ER and have no idea where to go as we panic from choice paralysis.

[0:27:33] <%MarylandJutsu> @cade_calrayn but only sometimes
[0:27:35] <%cade_calrayn> big and strong
[0:27:35] <DXLelouch24> Just take a pill a day easy peasy
[0:27:54] <%cade_calrayn> is it because of the skeletons?
[0:27:59] <3viltiki> so Paige is in love with Quark. When is she going to start stockpiling gold-pressed latinum?
[0:28:25] <%Dakuu75> Yes, you need dead-things for zombies
[0:28:27] <jeppeww> yes zombies require corpses
[0:28:31] <cartakus> necro?
[0:28:32] <%MarylandJutsu> its often because of the skeletons
[0:28:37] <%MarylandJutsu> its at least 80%
[0:28:46] <baka_sugoi> Necromancy is COOL
[0:28:55] <DXLelouch24> The answer is always yes
[0:28:58] <DXLelouch24> ALWAYS

[0:29:37] <Slimeking_Mike> Fuck Yes da FLAMING SKULL
[0:29:48] <@MelBrooksKA> Hello today people
[0:29:50] <%Dakuu75> what's this gold path line behind her, when she walks?
[0:29:54] <@MelBrooksKA> How is the stream going?
[0:30:03] <%Bloomingzonda> @Dakuu75 a cosmetic
[0:30:08] <%MarylandJutsu> hello on this day Mel
[0:30:11] <%MarylandJutsu> paiges died already
[0:30:19] <%Dakuu75> oh, gotchya @Bloomingzonda
[0:30:20] <+PrimalDweeb> Not melancholy! How could they!
[0:30:26] <%JoshManVGH> !uptime
[0:30:38] <+talldarkandintroverted> Im so happy ive caught the bi annual peach stream!
[0:30:39] <%BinaryFireball> path of exlie is such a great game
[0:30:43] <%JoshManVGH> Oh that command isn't real
[0:30:47] <%BinaryFireball> what build are you going for paige?
[0:30:49] <%cade_calrayn> it's actually pronounced like fetta, Paige
[0:30:53] <%cade_calrayn> fet-id
[0:31:06] <%JoshManVGH> Oh wow this is just Diablo, huh? Neat!
[0:31:21] <%blaccbird914> blaccbird914 subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 21 months! 
[0:31:27] <%JoshManVGH> Does anyone know how controller support is? Or of it is?
[0:31:28] <itsdasteve> feh-tid
[0:31:29] <%BinaryFireball> fetlife-id
[0:31:30] <+ArcanumArcanum> the second thing you said
[0:31:30] <tanarath> It's what Diablo 3 should have been.
[0:31:33] <+greasypete00> feh-tid
[0:31:33] <baka_sugoi> f e e t
[0:31:33] <%Ranryu692> the second one
[0:31:35] <SovPho> feetsied
[0:31:41] <$shurtal> it's puh-terodactyl
[0:31:42] <%Bloomingzonda> The way Paige says fetid just makes me think of a above ground pool walking around on little feet
[0:31:44] <@MelBrooksKA> I've heard both
[0:31:48] <%CappuccinoGuil> I keep coming back to this game every so often and then dropping it, then coming back again and just getting stuck on this loop. It's a good game, though
[0:31:55] <%MarylandJutsu> also heard both
[0:32:01] <%BinaryFireball> is this a necromancer build?
[0:32:03] <Slimeking_Mike> inthink both pronunciations are acceptable
[0:32:04] <%cade_calrayn> you'll always have fermunda though Paige
[0:32:05] <%BinaryFireball> didnt know you could do that
[0:32:08] <%JoshManVGH> Defeated the Fetid Abomination
[0:32:23] <@MelBrooksKA> It's a fancy word, no one actually knows how to say fancy words
[0:32:31] <%Dakuu75> if she gets a chaos orb. we gotta tell her to use it on the summon skeleton
[0:32:50] <@MelBrooksKA> That's why they're fancy
[0:32:56] <%CappuccinoGuil> Playing Path of Exile by yourself? Nah, she's WITH HER BOOOOOOOOYS
[0:32:57] <%JoshManVGH> @melbrookska Like Aegis? Anyone who knew how to pronounce that is dead, now is our time!
[0:33:07] <@SoFarFetched> the feeted
[0:33:22] <%BinaryFireball> the stank pit
[0:33:22] <$shurtal> "Show feet-id"
[0:33:26] <3viltiki> Paige and her Pap and Sans skelly bois
[0:33:27] <jeppeww> you can see where your quests are on the hotekey-'U' map
[0:33:29] <@SoFarFetched> "Go West towards the Stinky Doodoo Pool"
[0:33:31] <+ArsCaelia> not ~poetic~ enough
[0:33:33] <%Bloomingzonda> The Smell Pond
[0:33:33] <itsdasteve> it's pronounced sty-nky
[0:33:33] <@MelBrooksKA> @JoshManVGH It shall be a great melee
[0:33:36] <baka_sugoi> pool of F E E T
[0:33:47] <%JoshManVGH> Epic level enemy "Stinky Stonky Fleshmen"
[0:33:49] <DXLelouch24> Because that doesnt sound fancy enough
[0:34:02] <+Breaknoon> stank
[0:34:04] <%BinaryFireball> dip your toes in to the tarentino lagune
[0:34:08] <SovPho> There's a South Asian spice called asafoetida that Romans were obsessed with but it smells like corpse
[0:34:08] <%cade_calrayn> the fermunda pool
[0:34:10] <%BinaryFireball> lagoon?
[0:34:18] <+ArsCaelia> someone get those feet out of the pool, it's gonna scare off the tourists
[0:34:19] <%BinaryFireball> legume
[0:34:26] <baka_sugoi> lagoon of feet sweat
[0:34:30] <SovPho> Indians call it Hing I think
[0:34:40] <%JoshManVGH> @sovpho Neat! Is that spice still used in modern era?
[0:34:41] <DXLelouch24> Blight Town sounds more intimidating than Stink Town
[0:34:45] <DXLelouch24> Prove me wrong
[0:34:48] <+cryberries> Hi frens nyxiWave
[0:35:01] <ergulor> summon raving spirit
[0:35:14] <Broand> A cool thing is that Nessa in town will sell other skill gems if you don't know which one you want
[0:35:17] <%cade_calrayn> detonate the skeletons? on stream? :O
[0:35:20] <+witchcraftyasmr> Hi peach! Missed you!
[0:35:48] <SovPho> @JoshManVGH yeah it's pretty much the thing that American/Western cooks miss in their Indian food

[0:38:33] <%thatbrownguy64> thatbrownguy64 subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 9 months! 
[0:38:53] <Broand> So a neat feature about this game is that there's no such thing as "gold" or like a granular currency. All of trade is managed in items which change the stats of weapons and armor
[0:38:55] <%Dakuu75> majority of the time, having gem slots that connect or fit your play-style are more important.
[0:39:31] <Broand> I have an armor piece right now which has zero stats, but it has 6 connected slots
[0:39:41] <%JoshManVGH> @sovpho Interesting! That's a shame it's not used stateside.
[0:39:55] <DXLelouch24> Its like Materia, if rather have more options

[0:40:46] <%cade_calrayn> BRUTE SMARTS
[0:41:04] <%Dakuu75> is the new Atlas-stuf available all rdy or is she playing it early or wut?
[0:41:25] <itsdasteve> want to get really technical?  it's more accurately pronounced feh-did, no hard T sound
[0:41:25] <ashuckel> you can turn on the display of your minions hp bar above their head, that way you can recognize which are yours
[0:41:29] <+SWFanatic> #pathoftextile
[0:41:37] <3viltiki> don't worry Paige, no one will make fun of you for Feetid and no one  will totally tell Pat about it. And I bet no one will draw fanart about a feetid pool either

[0:42:06] <SovPho> @Dakuu75 Atlas stuff is available after you beat the game (act 10), so it probably won't be until after that. But this is a general-case expansion with more than just Atlas updates.

[0:44:54] <leinadtonu> Hi Paige and chat. Twitch didn't alert me you were on. Dumb Twitch.
[0:45:39] <fluffy_sauce> what dungeon crawlers have you played before?
[0:46:31] <+Derupiko> paige cam!

[0:48:29] <Zeif00> Hay Paige, hay chat, hope y'all are having a lovely day! <3
[0:49:10] <%JoshManVGH> Why not?
[0:49:37] <+OverzealousEuthanasiast> my uncle is actually called Bob too
[0:49:41] <graemecrackers2> are they gucci ?
[0:49:42] <@MelBrooksKA> I actually do have an uncle named bob
[0:49:46] <CorpulentToad> Yo, yo, yo! What's good Peach. :D
[0:50:03] <Broand> You can use an orb of augmentation on stuff which only give one bonus, and they'll give TWO bonuses
[0:50:06] <+Laycas49> Paige, What's your favorite fortnite dance
[0:50:18] <Shygster> Is this Diablo II

[0:50:30] <+OverzealousEuthanasiast> "how do clothe happun?"
[0:50:30] <%JoshManVGH> Complicated buckles I bet
[0:50:32] <graemecrackers2> how do i put on pants ?
[0:50:33] <+cvp5127> shirt holes are hard
[0:50:42] <+coward_man> just looking at the inventory is causing me to freak out. This is not the type of game I'd expect you to be in on
[0:50:45] <%BinaryFireball> its the zippers that wont zip
[0:50:57] <CorpulentToad> "Does the wrist go first or the fingers?..."
[0:50:59] <@SoFarFetched> just never wear pants
[0:51:02] <@SoFarFetched> always on the ground
[0:51:10] <%tizz86> Ban Pants!
[0:51:18] <peyodogo> fuck god damn this stream is succeeding in making me want to fire up poe again
[0:51:33] <graemecrackers2> i pefet a kilt it only has one hole so i know where things go
[0:51:47] <+OverzealousEuthanasiast> do you get pets in this as well as minions, or?
[0:52:11] <%BinaryFireball> if bob's my uncle... then who's my dan????
[0:52:17] <Broand> Belts
[0:52:21] <%JoshManVGH> Belt?
[0:52:29] <graemecrackers2> i couldnt find any big bags of peanutbutter m&ms at the zerhrs
[0:52:29] <%Dementedpenguin> @tizz86 Thanks for the gift sub!
[0:52:30] <%QueequegTheater> I need literally anything to distract me from IRL today
[0:52:32] <+other_badger> there are cosmetic pets you can microtransaction for
[0:52:40] <%JoshManVGH> MAGIC PANTS!
[0:52:41] <%Dakuu75> going commando
[0:52:48] <ergulor> poe is a pantless game
[0:52:55] <%JoshManVGH> There's a pets tab
[0:53:00] <ergulor> from your inventory iirc
[0:53:01] <+ArcanumArcanum> M for the shop N for your cosmetic tab
[0:53:08] <%BinaryFireball> poe is the last game to do dlc correctly
[0:53:12] <+OverzealousEuthanasiast> ooh, well, if they wanna bit of cash for it, it's more acceptable in a free-2-play
[0:53:13] <FassieFons> belts are strictly for holding flasks, not pants
[0:53:14] <%QueequegTheater> Look at Paige's adorable little cock
[0:53:31] <%cade_calrayn> oh you mean like a lot going on visually?
[0:53:31] <+BuckChuckman> I don't think you're allowed to show your peacock on stream
[0:53:38] <%JoshManVGH> Are their freemium paywalls to progress or anything?
[0:53:41] <3viltiki> chat when Paige pulls out her peacock
[0:53:51] <%cade_calrayn> I thought you were saying like it was too emotional to have the peacock out haha
[0:53:54] <Broand> Press tab to make map big
[0:53:54] <Daxalog> Dont you have to play monster Hunter later?
[0:53:55] <peyodogo> honestly poe is a really fair deal for f2p, the entire thing is available but quality of life starts suffering with your limited stash
[0:53:56] <ergulor> tab for map
[0:54:01] <segychan> this game slaps and owns
[0:54:17] <peyodogo> so when that starts bothering you you buy more tabs
[0:54:31] <peyodogo> thats it, the rest is free or cosmetic
[0:54:39] <%cade_calrayn> bloodborne
[0:54:48] <%JoshManVGH> @peyodogo How much do more stash tabs cost?
[0:54:57] <PlaidisTheNewPlaid> Why though?
[0:55:04] <peyodogo> yooooo return to undertale!
[0:55:13] <+coward_man> okay that sounds like a hilarious quirk for a necromancer to have
[0:55:21] <graemecrackers2> hide the chocolates in the top shelves
[0:55:33] <%JoshManVGH> Where skele friends being lazy last time?
[0:55:51] <%JoshManVGH> More hidden candy?
[0:55:55] <graemecrackers2> lol
[0:55:57] <baka_sugoi> Jebuss
[0:56:04] <%cade_calrayn> wait so this wans't the Peanut M&Ms story?
[0:56:06] <+zamatermort> Do tell
[0:56:10] <SovPho> why is pat so obsessed with candy
[0:56:12] <Zeif00> Is there another tale in the candy sneaking saga?
[0:56:16] <PlaidisTheNewPlaid> Was he snorting Monster Energy again?
[0:56:19] <graemecrackers2> it was prob the 2 bags
[0:56:19] <Parapattern> Any you find is just decoy hidden candy
[0:56:20] <Daxalog> Too Much Baggage!
[0:56:21] <%JoshManVGH> Candy is tasty
[0:56:26] <+coward_man> was he hiding it in Elmo's tower?
[0:56:42] <+coward_man> and if not, check the tower for candy
[0:56:56] <SovPho> just tp and sell your junk
[0:56:57] <+OrangeMDT> Feel like Pat just needs a smoothie. Way better than candy
[0:57:02] <ergulor> move the rings
[0:57:05] <graemecrackers2> nice
[0:57:08] <@PatStaresAt> wait what

[0:57:27] <peyodogo> @JoshManVGH it depends on the type and it's a bit obfuscated by the ingame currency, but the minimum you spend is $5 usd and that can get you another tab or two
[0:57:27] <+OrangeMDT> Oh no…
[0:57:36] <Daxalog> eyeussy
[0:57:37] <peyodogo> depending on whether they're on sale or not
[0:57:37] <%JoshManVGH> @patstaresat Paige aluded to some sort of candy shennanigans happening recently
[0:57:47] <@PatStaresAt> uhh i gotta go lol
[0:57:49] <+coward_man> we're just trying to figure out where you hid the candy this time
[0:57:53] <%BinaryFireball> its on the top shelf pat

[0:58:09] <ergulor> you didn't heal paige
[0:58:09] <%JoshManVGH> Aww

[0:58:38] <%JoshManVGH> @peyodogo That's not bad!
[0:58:49] <segychan> you can shift click or ctrl click or something to move items around faster @PeachSaliva
[0:58:49] <andimustmask> you can shift rightclick stuff to the inventory automatically
[0:59:03] <+mrcake_dragonman> Heya @PeachSaliva long time no see
[0:59:03] <andimustmask> also act 1 got a big difficulty overhaul last patch
[0:59:06] <%aslfrasle> aslfrasle subscribed with Prime. They've subscribed for 16 months! Hey Paige, you may recall about two months ago, I mentioned that one of my big goals 2022 was coming out as trans to family. Well, not only have I done that, but it went amazingly and they're all extremely supportive! Hoping to see my doc about HRT soon!
[0:59:45] <@PatStaresAt> @andimustmask harder or easier?
[0:59:48] <PocketBearIllustrator> Hey, Paige n chat. How's everyone this evening?
[0:59:56] <peyodogo> @JoshManVGH it's a very fair way to monetize for a f2p game, i think! the cosmetic stuff gets pretty expensive but that's not essential
[0:59:56] <PlaidisTheNewPlaid> Happy hour-long stream everyone!
[0:59:58] <butthurtdave> I always wanted to get into this game but the first time I did I apparently built my character all wrong so once I got to the endgame stuff I was just getting instantly gibbed by everything
[0:59:58] <segychan> act 1 felt harder yo
[0:59:59] <tanarath> Pretty good.
[1:00:06] <+triage0> oh hey it's the game with the skulls and gems and bits and bobs
[1:00:10] <%MrBorisMakarov> MrBorisMakarov subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 58 months! number go brrrrr
[1:00:23] <%JoshManVGH> Oh I like the little pathing trail you leave behind, that's neat
[1:00:31] <%BinaryFireball> the only thing I dont like about poe is all the different currencies
[1:00:38] <%BinaryFireball> everything else is amazing
[1:00:54] <peyodogo> @butthurtdave oh dude that's such a bummer, i wish it was easier to respec
[1:01:08] <%AncelDeLambert> that stash box is giving me an organizational shitfit

[1:05:53] <ergulor> oh god just 1 left
[1:06:02] <%cade_calrayn> finally living out that D&D desire
[1:06:07] <%MarylandJutsu> zomboes are baically skeelton and tahts enough for paige
[1:06:21] <%QueequegTheater> I remember D3 necromancer having some strong facefucking builds with the bone armor, maybe Witch has something similar
[1:06:29] <%AncelDeLambert> oh, he's doing it later, okay
[1:06:29] <urkleturtle> are we going in blind or following a build guide?
[1:06:36] <%MarylandJutsu> Man Pat keeps copying you paige
[1:06:37] <%AncelDeLambert> I thought you two would be playing together
[1:06:38] <%MarylandJutsu> smh
[1:07:06] <tanarath> He's going for minions, so probably witch?
[1:08:15] <ergulor> Having him go long neck pantless Templar would be fun
[1:08:23] <Broand> Even within the witch, there's plenty of ways you can build a minion build
[1:08:24] <%AncelDeLambert> AncelDeLambert subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 41 months! Favorite Freakazoid villain, go!
[1:08:27] <%JoshManVGH> Womp womp

[1:09:10] <%AncelDeLambert> how dare you scare these children who are having ze nice happy time
[1:10:06] <Broand> Quicksilver is rare and it's good to have
[1:10:33] <+RedBandolier> we love fast, 5 quicksilvers lets go

[1:13:50] <Coyote_Zappa> get beefed up
[1:13:53] <graemecrackers2> no skeleton minions ?
[1:14:27] <tanarath> @ergulor totem build templar was my first character, it was fun if jank af.
[1:15:17] <%skrewarrior> is the line that follows you to help with getting lost?
[1:15:30] <+ShinEllison> sup not-pat
[1:15:33] <+RedBandolier> more like rude princess
[1:15:41] <%CappuccinoGuil> @RedBandolier damn it, you beat me to it
[1:15:49] <MyNameIsRasus> hello today
[1:15:54] <%CappuccinoGuil> JUST LIKE PAIGE BEAT THAT PRINCESS AYYYY
[1:16:20] <graemecrackers2> aw another women paige must kill
[1:16:22] <Enn19> Just got here,Paige have a build or just havin fun with it?
[1:16:38] <reginault> can hold shift and use scrolls to repeatedly use (without clicking the scroll each time)
[1:16:46] <tanarath> @skrewarrior seems to be a neat accessibility thing GGG sent Paige, here's hoping it is available for all soon.
[1:16:51] <%CappuccinoGuil> Man I really like that effect on the shoes, it's perfect for not getting lost
[1:17:24] <SovPho> @PeachSaliva did they do something to make it easier to follow your own builds or is it still pretty punishing if you don't know what's up?
[1:18:05] <ergulor> @tanarath i did a fireball witch, dominus killed that poor girl so many times in normal difficulty back in 2011
[1:18:29] <Broand> General rule: More life is always good
[1:18:33] <+RedBandolier> @ergulor yo 2011 dominus was terrifying
[1:18:48] <ergulor> yeah, then it was malakai
[1:18:48] <@Moobot> Check out more about Path of Exile and the new Siege of the Atlas Expansion here! https://i.try.games/path-of-exile-3-17/a3174z
[1:19:06] <ergulor> god i remmeber when act 4 dropped that malakia was feared
[1:19:08] <graemecrackers2> I wonder if we'll get a Manhunt 3 from Rockstar games
[1:19:09] <tanarath> I just didn't really get that fight, so I died a few times, but Totem Templar is pretty strong.
[1:19:26] <Broand> You can branch off in any direction
[1:19:53] <+BigCoffee> what's peach playing
[1:19:54] <SovPho> What keystones are you looking to have?
[1:19:56] <reginault> that central node is pretty good afaik
[1:19:57] <+BigCoffee> necro?
[1:20:03] <%Dakuu75> "you go this way, i'll go home."
[1:20:29] <Broand> yeah necro
[1:20:48] <PirateMike_> i like yo hat
[1:22:03] <graemecrackers2> are those bose headphones ?
[1:22:13] <Broand> The minion nodes in the middle yeah, The thing to remember is that if it don't say minions, your minions don't get anything out of it
[1:23:46] <%tizz86> Have you seen the Sony XM4's?
[1:24:59] <%Dakuu75> is there an auto-sort hotkey? or something like that?
[1:25:23] <Broand> Fun fact: This game mainly uses various "orbs" as currency. As a result, Pat is the richest man in PoE
[1:26:45] <reginault> holding "Alt" displays all items on ground
[1:27:03] <Broand> Press Z for me? I think you've got your loot names hidden
[1:27:09] <+tennodoomtor> move the ring
[1:27:20] <+tennodoomtor> and slide the bo0ttom right
[1:28:41] <%rumtumtugnutz> @BigCoffee Path of Exile
[1:29:18] <+tennodoomtor> move boots over
[1:29:40] <Broand> You can talk to him again if you don't take it immediately
[1:29:40] <reginault> rewards can be left, and re-acquired later by talking to the NPC
[1:29:41] <%Dakuu75> even if you close the reward window. you can grab it anytime
[1:29:50] <+tennodoomtor> lol, does pat still get his mind goblins on loot layout?
[1:30:00] <+RedBandolier> strength is fine, it can help you equip gear that needs it
[1:30:08] <%cade_calrayn> Paige saying "I don't want strength" - is this the Ruby Weapon Hour or WHAT?
[1:30:09] <+RedBandolier> could get you some better armor later
[1:30:13] <dannyilhan> eeey buona sera Paige!
[1:30:15] <Daxalog> i thought you were about Big damage with object
[1:30:18] <Zourath> @Dakuu75 Sort of. You can set the various tabs in your stash so that specific kinds of items will be sorted into that tab if you ctrl-click the items in.
[1:30:35] <Broand> It's fine, strength gives you a little extra life
[1:30:52] <Coyote_Zappa> jesus christ what is this
[1:30:55] <%Bane_Kaikyo> HOLY MOTHER OF SPHERE GRIDS
[1:31:17] <dannyilhan> big grid energy
[1:31:39] <$cooldude69xx> Holy shit this menu is cray cray
[1:31:47] <yukichocomilk> this grid is a nightmare
[1:31:48] <reginault> generally wanna pick one of Fire or Minions
[1:31:59] <+sandrews> hello how are things going?
[1:31:59] <SovPho> Focusing on damage until like act 4 is pretty good so fuck it
[1:32:19] <+RedBandolier> not gonna lie i probably have spent as much time planning that skill tree as i have playing the game lmao
[1:32:46] <%Dakuu75> @RedBandolier that's just the way it goes mate~
[1:32:54] <+sixcubit> oh i've never seen peach's gamer swamp before
[1:33:03] <Zourath> @yukichocomilk You don't even know the half of it. There's socketable jewels that alter the passive tree, even adding additional branches.
[1:33:03] <%AncelDeLambert> WEEEEEEEELL! "I'm fucking warning you, Cartman!"
[1:33:08] <%Bane_Kaikyo> decisions are dumb
[1:33:27] <+OverzealousEuthanasiast> it's chill with your life choices
[1:34:05] <%CappuccinoGuil> MAKE GOOD CHOICES ALWAYS ALL THE TIME NEVER BE WRONG
[1:34:10] <$cooldude69xx> tell him Cartman would beat him in  a fight
[1:34:25] <%cade_calrayn> Paige's greatest enemies have teamed up to challenge her: numbers and making decisions
[1:34:26] <@Moobot> Check out more about Path of Exile and the new Siege of the Atlas Expansion here! https://i.try.games/path-of-exile-3-17/a3174z
[1:34:55] <%AncelDeLambert> give blue
[1:35:08] <%MarylandJutsu> you want yellow?
[1:35:17] <%CappuccinoGuil> I got some ramen and they gave me so much broth, it looks like I have a soup, everything's floating LUL
[1:35:23] <%Dakuu75> lol
[1:35:33] <@SoFarFetched> Its true,I love blue and I am a bitch.
[1:35:36] <+RedBandolier> swish swish
[1:35:42] <%bravebravesrobin> my eyes are blue
[1:35:42] <%cade_calrayn> Paige, you know of the Gay Triangle? We can only do two of three - Cook, Drive, and Do Math
[1:36:00] <%cade_calrayn> You can cook and drive. It's exceptionally rare for a gay to do all 3.
[1:36:05] <%MarylandJutsu> becky lemmee smash
[1:36:28] <%CappuccinoGuil> @cade_calrayn what... what if... what if I can't do any o-o-of thoooose??? ;-;
[1:36:35] <JobbedBone> everyone should have some blue and white porcelain
[1:36:40] <%cade_calrayn> then you're extra special and we still love you
[1:36:55] <Broand> Corrupted means you can't modify it, that's all
[1:36:58] <%CappuccinoGuil> @cade_calrayn thank you for accepting me, I sincerely appreciate it
[1:37:10] <%Bane_Kaikyo> @CappuccinoGuil then perhaps you are min/maxing to be super duper hot or something?
[1:37:13] <%CappuccinoGuil> It do be yellow tho
[1:37:25] <Broand> Those slippers are ok
[1:37:34] <Ell1ot> hi Paige!
[1:38:03] <%CappuccinoGuil> @Bane_Kaikyo I hope so, I'm betting on becoming a real hot silver fox in like 10-15 years
[1:38:20] <Ell1ot> big number
[1:38:26] <%Bane_Kaikyo> @CappuccinoGuil Good luck with that
[1:38:29] <+vivaldiva> Ctrl+click saves you dragging from boxes, just as a tiny effort saver
[1:38:33] <JobbedBone> angry gloves jermaSun
[1:39:07] <SomeStrangeBroad> hey I got peach live! how far in are we?
[1:39:19] <reginault> becky, i got you yellow
[1:39:24] <+triage0> do you need more life or smack things harder?
[1:39:26] <+RedBandolier> life, for sure
[1:39:26] <%tizz86> wicked sma
[1:39:28] <%MarylandJutsu> Smarter does more damage id imagine?
[1:39:31] <olaksi> smart and no life is bad combo imo
[1:39:31] <%Dakuu75> I'd say more life atm
[1:39:33] <%CappuccinoGuil> Is paige smarter or healthier?
[1:39:35] <+cherrycottontail> life is for cowards you have zombies
[1:39:38] <%Bane_Kaikyo> I wish I could wear jewelry that makes me smarter
[1:39:40] <whittacre> just flip a coin
[1:39:40] <+ArcanumArcanum> life > damage at this point for you
[1:39:44] <Ell1ot> i don't know what stats do in this game
[1:39:50] <+RedBandolier> smart doesn't do anything unless you care about having big energy shield or big mana
[1:39:58] <%a_mad_dragon_> better start making some mule characters
[1:40:07] <+RedBandolier> or gear requirements
[1:40:17] <%CappuccinoGuil> @Ell1ot well, you see *pulls out 20 spreadsheets*
[1:40:36] <%CappuccinoGuil> How viable is making a Big Shield build, chat?
[1:40:42] <+Fefe41> I have no reference to any of these stats except my D2 knowledge
[1:40:43] <SomeStrangeBroad> Tony is my uncle..and he's weird
[1:40:59] <Broand> As you can imagine chat, the game makes most of its money from sales of extra stash tabs
[1:41:11] <+RedBandolier> @CappuccinoGuil depends, do you mean Big (Energy) Shield or Big Shield (In my Hand)?
[1:41:30] <leole11> the instance resets if 10 minutes pass
[1:41:39] <%CappuccinoGuil> @RedBandolier I was thinking big energy shield, but honestly, I am now curious about Big shield in hand too
[1:41:42] <Broand> The way forward is through the submerged passage
[1:41:47] <%KeiganOfAstora> Damn I forgot about this. Good stream?
[1:41:47] <@Moobot> Check out more about Path of Exile and the new Siege of the Atlas Expansion here! https://i.try.games/path-of-exile-3-17/a3174z
[1:42:00] <SomeStrangeBroad> I should cram baulders gate into the ps4 soon
[1:42:09] <+RedBandolier> trick question they're both viable  csbeastSOB
[1:42:19] <%CappuccinoGuil> @RedBandolier lmao awesome
[1:42:25] <baka_sugoi> ppl with holes in there pockets
[1:42:39] <saltyblackyouth> !!pathofexile
[1:42:42] <%CappuccinoGuil> @baka_sugoi you're carrying chests in your pockets?
[1:42:53] <baka_sugoi> Magic pants
[1:43:08] <SomeStrangeBroad> paige looks super cute today
[1:43:28] <Broand> There's an exit you missed in the submerged passage which leads onward
[1:43:45] <Ell1ot> why does paige have a harem of naked men following her around?
[1:44:03] <%CappuccinoGuil> @Ell1ot because she's a witch
[1:44:06] <ergulor> pasage
[1:44:09] <Ell1ot> neat!
[1:44:30] <SomeStrangeBroad> *chews on circus peanuts*
[1:45:13] <+RedBandolier> hell yeah dried mangoes are lit
[1:45:23] <%CappuccinoGuil> open your map and go where you haven't been to yet?
[1:45:26] <Broand> Look for a thin staircase, should be on the map somewhere (it's randomly generated)
[1:45:37] <+Ches_Neckbeard> dried mango's are cringe
[1:45:55] <SomeStrangeBroad> I like dried apples
[1:45:59] <Broand> Not that way
[1:46:03] <ergulor> there are two exits here
[1:46:08] <ergulor> no
[1:46:08] <+cherrycottontail> dired mangos were my go to snack before covid and i could get them in the bulk bins
[1:46:11] <ergulor> find a bridge
[1:46:36] <SomeStrangeBroad> banana chips are pretty good to
[1:47:30] <%CappuccinoGuil> I remember being in a fight once and being unable to summon zombies because I ran out of corpses
[1:47:56] <Broand> You'll find it eventually, it's in that area somewhere
[1:47:59] <%CappuccinoGuil> I'll show YOU clutter, Witch! I have no idea what I mean by that, don't tell her
[1:48:22] <ergulor> extra zombie friend
[1:48:27] <Broand> now you can have a 4th boy
[1:48:29] <%CappuccinoGuil> What's gonna be the name of the 3rd zombie?
[1:48:36] <SomeStrangeBroad> I paused my game to be here
[1:49:10] <%CappuccinoGuil> @SomeStrangeBroad same, was doing a Scholar quest in FFXIV and now I'm watching this LUL
[1:49:17] <Broand> If it has 3 colors that are linked together (like that wand) you can sell it for a special orb
[1:49:49] <SomeStrangeBroad> yay us guil!
[1:49:50] <%CappuccinoGuil> Real glad the summons DON'T have a timer
[1:50:09] <iamnuff> ooh, level ups.
[1:50:18] <%CappuccinoGuil> Should she be leveling up the crystals on the right?
[1:50:45] <ergulor> yup
[1:50:46] <iamnuff> Nice wings Peach.
[1:50:51] <%CappuccinoGuil> Like, is there any reason not to level them up?
[1:51:13] <Ell1ot> this kinda looks like the Diablo2
[1:51:13] <Broand> You can summon a 4th zombo now by the way, thanks to that node on the passive tree
[1:51:21] <%CappuccinoGuil> Holy shit, last time I played this was 5 years ago damn
[1:51:26] <cpt_langosta> big spider, ok?
[1:51:26] <viciousgrim> her lv?
[1:51:29] <iamnuff> Dripping dead. They got that drip.
[1:51:41] <ergulor> @CappuccinoGuil usually for stuff like cast on damage taken set-ups or because you don't meet the requirements to level them up
[1:52:06] <SomeStrangeBroad> I made Hasbrouck casserole and fish for dinner...it was so gooooood
[1:52:15] <SomeStrangeBroad> hashbrown
[1:52:22] <$Batophobe> oh hey, favorite game
[1:52:23] <@Moobot> Check out more about Path of Exile and the new Siege of the Atlas Expansion here! https://i.try.games/path-of-exile-3-17/a3174z
[1:52:43] <Ell1ot> do you name your handsome zombie men?
[1:52:59] <iamnuff> I think pressing Shift shows all loot?
[1:53:08] <SomeStrangeBroad> paige wishes the zombie were skeleton
[1:53:40] <cpt_langosta> zombies are just wider skeletons
[1:53:43] <Broand> You can press Z to make all of those appear
[1:53:46] <iamnuff> press shift or control
[1:53:54] <%Dakuu75> it's still there on the floor
[1:53:55] <SomeStrangeBroad> fleshy skeletons
[1:53:56] <baka_sugoi> csbeastSetIn NotLikeThis csbeastSetIn
[1:53:58] <iamnuff> one of them highlights all loot on floor
[1:54:01] <reginault> its on the ground nakkiLaugh
[1:54:02] <%MarylandJutsu> do you want the answer to that question? >:3
[1:54:04] <jeppeww> you can turn on items always being visible in ui settings
[1:54:05] <ergulor> press z
[1:54:11] <%cade_calrayn> oh no, balls are exposed
[1:54:12] <reginault> press Z
[1:54:19] <iamnuff> There's a button that shows all loot on floor
[1:54:47] <%MarylandJutsu> eh its entertainig
[1:54:54] <SomeStrangeBroad> because it makes you awesome
[1:55:04] <SovPho> z toggles all items shown and i think alt does it during keydown
[1:55:29] <%CappuccinoGuil> You're a walking ice bomb"
[1:55:57] <Danitaras> not a complaint but curiosity, are you finished with the vtuber or just taking a break?
[1:56:17] <iamnuff> Seagulls!
[1:56:20] <+blastyoboots> @PeachSaliva does this have the Diablo thing where you hold down Alt and all pick-uppable items on the ground show their hovering names?
[1:56:45] <Danitaras> ah apologies I must of missed you saying this before
[1:56:48] <ergulor> @blastyoboots you can just press z to show all items or use a lootfilter
[1:56:52] <+blastyoboots> ahh
[1:56:57] <iamnuff> For a moment I thought you were saying that it's for when yo have lupus, and I was about to ask when you don't have lupus.
[1:57:01] <%Dakuu75> dafuq
[1:57:02] <+Bailey__Gaming> Hello Paige how you doing hope all is well please don't break your glasses
[1:57:14] <Mrbaconator> those people sound fucking cringe
[1:57:14] <%MarylandJutsu> Also, you paid for it, so i mean....whats their problem with it
[1:57:15] <%king_wragles> It's Paige's toy, but people wanna tell her how to use it
[1:57:15] <+coward_man> oh wow that sounds super sucky that Lupus does that
[1:57:22] <yukichocomilk> there's always weirdos
[1:57:24] <iamnuff> Vtuber fans are weird, news at 11
[1:57:41] <Coyote_Zappa> she is flesh paige
[1:57:42] <Zebroneath> Not every Vtuber has to be a "character."  Silly notion that it has to be.
[1:57:44] <yukichocomilk> nah most vtuber viewers are normal, but weirdos are everywhere
[1:57:45] <+WonderLandGhost> @iamnuff Every fandom has weirdos lmao
[1:57:47] <+Bailey__Gaming> @peachsaliva what kinda build are you hoping to do?
[1:57:53] <baka_sugoi> Hu Man Paige
[1:57:53] <Mrbaconator> are there any v tubers you are a fan of? @PeachSaliva
[1:57:56] <cpt_langosta> but why fox and not wolf?
[1:58:02] <SomeStrangeBroad> it's snowing like a lot right now
[1:58:16] <MaybeFalco> just have a floodlight pointed at your face at all times LUL
[1:58:21] <baka_sugoi> LUL weeeebs
[1:58:24] <%ssjklyco> Realtuber
[1:58:35] <+WonderLandGhost> Unfortunately people online take things too seriously in general haha
[1:58:38] <%cade_calrayn> do we hear a Gieferton?
[1:58:47] <%MarylandJutsu> gasp gief saying helklo?
[1:58:52] <baka_sugoi> psaBork
[1:58:54] <%CappuccinoGuil> "Gross, women being all 3D????" mindset is WILD
[1:58:55] <floralkami> @cpt_langosta asking the real questions. why FOX and not WOLF?
[1:59:03] <+Shockrates20XX> What's that little dotted trail being left behind the character?
[1:59:07] <+Bailey__Gaming> what's the pacman pellets that come out of the butt?
[1:59:13] <iamnuff> I wanted to see pat look at the skill tree to see if he just started crying.
[1:59:20] <Danitaras> yeah i get it, as i said was just curious, real, vtuber or elmo pic it's still you doing your thing
[1:59:32] <ergulor> just in time for our lord and savious kuduku
[1:59:32] <%CappuccinoGuil> @Shockrates20XX something the devs gave her, helps with keeping track of where you've walked
[1:59:32] <@Moobot> Check out more about Path of Exile and the new Siege of the Atlas Expansion here! https://i.try.games/path-of-exile-3-17/a3174z
[1:59:47] <+RedBandolier> @Bailey__Gaming think i saw someone say they're an accessibility thing to track where the character has been
[1:59:49] <floralkami> @cappuccinoguil is it even real, cause that sounds like an imported stereotype about otakus and their VNs
[2:00:00] <%MarylandJutsu> yeah you've done a big ood job
[2:00:16] <+Shockrates20XX> @CappuccinoGuil Neat. Seems like it fades too fast though.
[2:00:16] <gyrobasel> dont know if someone asked this before, but do you have a special setup to ease the strain on your wrsits? @PeachSaliva
[2:00:28] <Chester_goes_Berserk> those darn cursed ranks
[2:00:28] <%CappuccinoGuil> @floralkami oh ABSOLUTELY it's fucking nasty
[2:00:41] <SomeStrangeBroad> paige I think you should know I have a platonic girly crush on you
[2:00:47] <%CappuccinoGuil> @Shockrates20XX maybe a little bit, yeah, kinda wish it was just a feature on the mini-map
[2:00:49] <viciousgrim> so what is your highest level character @peachsaliva
[2:00:55] <+Bailey__Gaming> @redbandolier that's p cool I wonder if someone could, mod pac man eating the dots as they disappear
[2:01:03] <baka_sugoi> LOOT MORE
[2:01:21] <%CappuccinoGuil> @baka_sugoi no space my guy
[2:01:24] <+Shockrates20XX> @CappuccinoGuil It'd be cool if you could sorta pulse it, like a reverse of the quest tracking markers some games have.
[2:01:45] <iamnuff> Do you struggle with decision paralysis? I know pat fights it, and it mkaes me think that this game would be poison for him.
[2:01:45] <baka_sugoi> womp womp
[2:01:48] <SomeStrangeBroad> thats probably creepy lol
[2:01:57] <%Bloomingzonda> Use wonderwall
[2:02:12] <+Bailey__Gaming> I like your characters big fancy aztec hat kinda deal
[2:02:20] <Enn19> I CAN NOT wait until Pat sees the passive tree
[2:02:25] <%CappuccinoGuil> @Bloomingzonda maybe
[2:02:29] <+Shockrates20XX> @iamnuff I think he's commented about that on this game specifically, yeah, that he's afraid of "ruining" his character.
[2:02:42] <tanarath> Hopping over to Pat's stream, thanks for streaming!
[2:02:50] <Ell1ot> i want to play now. Do i have to download from steam?
[2:02:59] <%CappuccinoGuil> @Ell1ot yup, but it's Free.99
[2:03:00] <iamnuff> This game has the worst/best skilltree that i've ever seen. It's mental.
[2:03:10] <iamnuff> But you can just respec, so it's fine.
[2:03:18] <Broand> Oh by the way, if pat makes a character on the league instead of on standard (which you are on) then you can't co-op unless one of you makes a new character on the others league
[2:03:27] <baka_sugoi> noice
[2:03:38] <cpt_langosta> and then pat said "LOL. LMAO. time to steal all of paige's viewers."
[2:03:40] <+Bailey__Gaming> do u feel bad killing the Skeletons?
[2:03:40] <$ErikFeral> I just joined, is Paige finally the Skeleton Queen?
[2:04:15] <baka_sugoi> onto psaOrb
[2:04:16] <Chester_goes_Berserk> not the goat men :O
[2:04:22] <JobbedBone> I suffer from decision fatigue and grocery delivery services have allowed me to function normally, shielded from the maniacal aisle design to keep you in the store longer to impulse buy
[2:04:41] <+Bailey__Gaming> what is the flashy icon? Next to shop?
[2:05:15] <+RedBandolier> yee you get chromatic orbs from selling anything that have all 3 colors linked together
[2:05:18] <+Bailey__Gaming> @jobbedbone click n collect rules
[2:05:57] <Chester_goes_Berserk> man I love the health/mana orbs, wish non-Diablo games used them cuz cool
[2:07:37] <%cade_calrayn> he heard you talking about other orbs and got jealous of the attention, Paige
[2:07:41] <JobbedBone> yeah its great. All of them have the inventory systems to track this and it would be easy to expose it as an app that sorts your grocery list by aisle, but it would hurt their bottom line.
[2:08:52] <Ell1ot> i've discovered that you can download from their website. Is it better to download from there or Steam?
[2:09:00] <+Bailey__Gaming> Dat was me !
[2:09:01] <Ell1ot> naughty skeletons
[2:09:23] <K_0_T_A_H> What a wasteful blood donor
[2:09:24] <godlesscruelty> why so zoomed in ?
[2:09:37] <%Bane_Kaikyo> @godlesscruelty I too wonder
[2:09:59] <teefpal> hey no vtuber avatar
