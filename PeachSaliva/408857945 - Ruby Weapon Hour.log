[0:20:28] <%ThePuddingDead> its not you
[0:20:35] <Pookiedaexzile> This is not the angle Im used tgo....I dont like change

[0:20:47] <SGrim> @PeachSaliva that
[0:20:47] <%evaguy> You were not bad in all of that
[0:20:47] <%ElenaManetta> It doesn't help you call everyone a BITCH and LOSER and FREAK and STUPID also in your posts apatJpeg
[0:20:48] <%mercado94> people dont undertand sarcasm or jokes on twitter
[0:20:50] <%hawk_rush> That tweet was fine

[0:20:52] <%GabeSweetMan> Eye of the beholder and whatnot
[0:20:52] <leinadtonu> text is difficult
[0:20:53] <$KruelDestiny> I do it too, i call them bitch fingers FeelsGoodMan
[0:20:53] <Travian_Valoris> Tone is difficult through text
[0:20:54] <$jobbedbone> no don't I love it
[0:20:57] <%starotter70> Nah, it's more fun
[0:20:57] <%juhbathehutt> tone is hard online
[0:20:58] <%spiritofmojave> Typing doesn't have any of that, you good
[0:21:00] <$TeraMercier> When you talk straight to a camera it can make people feel like you're calling out them specifically, which can be seen as overbearing
[0:21:03] <PoisonKnuckle> What happened now?
[0:21:04] <Pookiedaexzile> Change is scary
[0:21:07] <$jaxondorfred> you are so amazingly loved by your fans... fucking wow
[0:21:07] <Vaardvark> resting bitch fingers Kappa
[0:21:08] <$jobbedbone> don't change for the wet blankets
[0:21:08] <%TheSniperJoe> People should maybe just mind their own damn business?

[0:21:10] <Pookiedaexzile> is this the side of a fridge
[0:21:10] <$TeraMercier> But that's a viewer issue not you
[0:21:16] <viviknight> Nah, people are dense
[0:21:17] <tacostarvedbeast> the difficulty is very hard
[0:21:18] <%Breakfast_Megapowers> Just don't talk about it if people are going to be shits about it
[0:21:19] <levyaraujoazevedo90> sorry, that's not what I wanted to talk about
[0:21:20] <SGrim> @PeachSaliva that's because noone can tell how small and fragile you are online. Thus enhancing your intimidation factor. rooKek
[0:21:23] <DesuDesuDokiDoki> LUL

[0:21:35] <TBFeric> Yeah sometimes you seem pretty venomous on Twitter, it gets a bit scary haha. But you didn't seem that way about the "Pat's Keeper" thing
[0:21:36] <Fujiwara_92> WHY U ENABLING LUL
[0:21:37] <%mercado94> if he wants to bathe in redbull let him be

[0:21:40] <%ThePuddingDead> i'd never do that shit...that's getting too...that's pushing it
[0:21:40] <%waltzqueen> who the fuck does that?!
[0:21:41] <$TeraMercier> Paige doesn't need to be routinely hassled about what someone else is doing in her life
[0:21:45] <Sethzpyre> oh yeah i forgot pat was a five year old
[0:21:45] <%evaguy> People be crazy
[0:21:47] <%GabeSweetMan> People don't want a conversation they just want to dogpile.

[0:21:55] <%QueequegTheater> @PeachSaliva So you're saying you DIDN'T get my selfies

[0:47:45] <worldbrand> Get an extroverted friend and latch onto them
[0:47:46] <%ThePuddingDead> ...what's the situation?
[0:47:46] <bryanmildew> dab on the haters
[0:47:46] <Ion_Laser> take deep breaths
[0:47:46] <%JEiddew> optimistic nihilism
[0:47:48] <emillionghost> desensitize
[0:47:49] <Youwereeatenbyalid> yeah pretty much
[0:47:49] <%Lets_frown> @PeachSaliva cocaine LUL
[0:47:49] <Intolerable> ALCOHOL
[0:47:49] <%ThePuddingDead> just...shy?
[0:47:50] <redsynod> just don't
[0:47:51] <$SiameseSneeze> If you're of age, maybe a little bit of alcohol Kappa
[0:47:51] <+plzdodge> dab
[0:47:51] <+Tyonidus> The OG Pokemon intro literally WRECKS me emotionally from nostalgia and I get so emotional from hearing it.
[0:47:52] <leinadtonu> don't be shy.
[0:47:52] <+mik255> i know that feel
[0:47:53] <+pkmamsters> raise your volume, it legit helps
[0:47:53] <%Bouldus> i wait for these stream then shit talk a lot Kappa
[0:47:53] <%dukenux> Alcohol, though that probably isn't a good advice
[0:47:53] <+blastazoid26> BREAKTHROUGH
[0:47:54] <TwinBat> drink
[0:47:56] <BourneWarrior> GIVE UP
[0:47:57] <$rdark_ksu> liquid courage
[0:47:57] <Darkfire346> bring out your MASSIVE BEPIS
[0:47:57] <%starotter70> Say to yourself, nah whatever just do it tho
[0:47:59] <Youwereeatenbyalid> Desensitization is the key
[0:47:59] <LodiFrostbeard> SHYNESS IS A SWITCH, JUST TURN IT OFF
[0:47:59] <Fujiwara_92> alcohol
[0:47:59] <Luesagna00> looooots of porn
[0:48:00] <Huntercd> Alcohol does help
[0:48:00] <missingangle> Get out of your comfort zone. Take baby steps, but comfort zone go bye bye
[0:48:01] <%JEiddew> disasociate like i do
[0:48:01] <zamzoph> it's true tho
[0:48:03] <%RoboXGP> Read up on interesting topics
[0:48:04] <Th1sisstan> DRUGS
[0:48:06] <Ion_Laser> breathe in through the nose, and out through the mouth
[0:48:07] <rednecknazgul> show feet and/or bobs
[0:48:07] <ECRead> my advice is bad.... but alcohol
[0:48:08] <DracaenaLeaf> only talk when you find something to say
[0:48:08] <%ElenaManetta> Everyone is so focused on themselves, you don't need to be shy because no one is paying attention to you as much as you think. apatBlep
[0:48:08] <+skizzuto> Get a job that forces you to socialize, like a waiter or something
[0:48:08] <+pkmamsters> force yourself to speak louder and then you feel bigger
[0:48:08] <DesuDesuDokiDoki> alcoholism
[0:48:09] <+fatal_penguin_> I force myself to Joke alot. It helps.
[0:48:09] <%ceaselessdiplomacy> just try talking once it feels so good when you do
[0:48:10] <$KruelDestiny> Flake it until you bake it
[0:48:10] <%mercado94> im still shy. the easy way is say "fuck it just roll with it"
[0:48:11] <TBFeric> It's okay to be shy. It might help to try to spend time with an outgoing person, so they can be unshy FOR you, if that makes sense.
[0:48:11] <%RedMageRebel> it literally is fake it till you make it though
[0:48:13] <%some_random_variable> D&D helps
[0:48:14] <$TeraMercier> People generally aren't looking for reasons to hate you. Mostly people want to like other people
[0:48:14] <Travian_Valoris> Depends on the situation
[0:48:16] <redsynod> drugs help me
[0:48:16] <ccdrchau> Get with friends who are more out going than you so that you can get those rare opinions or conversation pieces in and kill it
[0:48:17] <GohanEgret> apatBig DRUGS
[0:48:18] <%starotter70> BIG DRUG
[0:48:18] <foreverN2dust> Fake it till you naked.
[0:48:19] <%Keyd00d> I have no advice
[0:48:19] <%QueequegTheater> Fake it til you make it does not mean be fake. Fake your CONFIDENCE, not your personality
[0:48:20] <+mik255> LIE CHEAT STEAL
[0:48:21] <Inebriateddonut> Do EVERY drug
[0:48:23] <$rdark_ksu> Gin is healthy
[0:48:24] <%GeneralSCPatton> PERSEVERE TO CONQUER FEAR?
[0:48:24] <%lewdskeletor13> Fake it till it becomes real
[0:48:24] <%dukenux> Healthy Drugs
[0:48:25] <missingangle> DRUGS! DRUGS! DRUGS!
[0:48:25] <Angry_Ev1L> anti shy drungs LUL
[0:48:26] <bryanmildew> but paige the cauldron

[0:48:31] <%MightyMaxT> @PeachSaliva My New Year's resolution "Fuck It, Do It Anyway" has really helped me a lot.
[0:48:31] <%tizz86> its smitt
[0:48:32] <Intolerable> DRUGS AND ALCOHOL
[0:48:34] <$TeraMercier> And also, most people are thinking about themselves more than they are about you
[0:48:35] <TwinBat> ALCOHOL IS MANKIND'S OLDEST FRIEND
[0:48:36] <+AncientToco> Drugs PogChamp
[0:48:37] <%mercado94> im super shy and people at work think im serious
[0:48:37] <%Toynota10> @PeachSaliva Well on that note, how do you deal with pressure? Are you ever able to keep a cool head?
[0:48:37] <ccdrchau> If you don't have friends, well, the ultimate end result is that you just go and make friends
[0:48:39] <+pkmamsters> Realize that EVERYONE's nervous all the time
[0:48:39] <+Tyonidus> When you feel shy go back in your room with your computer and video games nerds, that's our home.
[0:48:43] <drippygg> uhh
[0:48:44] <%RedMageRebel> d&d does help! whoever said that was right
[0:48:45] <ccdrchau> So you really just "Do it?" I guess
[0:48:47] <Intolerable> IT'S THE LUPUS
[0:48:49] <+mik255> GO EDDIE GUERRERO
[0:48:49] <+McSoliace> either go in deep or retreat like a coward this is how i live my life

[0:48:58] <%psychodave1234> dude i just asked out a girl i had a massive crush on in high school. first time ive done that shit in nearly 5 years. there's not really advice for it. just fight that part of your brain and do it
[0:48:58] <digitaldenam> drugs till they stop working I guess
[0:48:59] <bryanmildew> BEES
[0:48:59] <%dukenux> ITS HIP
[0:48:59] <+pkmamsters> aahh yeah bee boiz
[0:48:59] <%SuichiTanaka> Role play a super version of yourself that you could never be. And then act it out even if it's uncomfortable.
[0:49:00] <%Breakfast_Megapowers> @PeachSaliva Never turn away someone who tries to interact with you. If you are shy, that is a recipe to be forever lonely.
[0:49:02] <DesuDesuDokiDoki> NOT THE BEES
[0:49:02] <%mercado94> BEES
[0:49:02] <$monkeyhous3> keep bees?

[0:49:09] <%JEiddew> where is this POSSIBLY going
[0:49:10] <MicrotonalMatt> Lock the doors and close the windows and pretend the outside world doesn't exist because your furniture knows the truth that the media is keeping the man down
[0:49:10] <%lewdskeletor13> NOT THE BEES
[0:49:11] <bryanmildew> their beekeepery
[0:49:15] <viviknight> Beads?
[0:49:15] <$TeraMercier> Someone who never tries to get themselves out there can never see themselves succeed, so give yourself the material
[0:49:16] <BourneWarrior> ITS HIP TO

[0:49:26] <$Weeabooninja> Bees
[0:49:29] <Smaenus> Refuse their sandwiches, don't fall for the bee trap again
[0:49:29] <$monkeyhous3> I'll give you $5 to eat this bowl of bees
[0:49:30] <%ThePuddingDead> @PeachSaliva Rationalize it in your mind, consider what would be that absolute WORST result for trying the thing you're about to try, and consider what you have to gain, be reasonable and consider how your emotions would react, essentially steel yourself from...."yourself" and give it a brief try and see the results
[0:49:30] <%dukenux> Beat that baby bitch that is your inner self and FORCE THEM TO OBEY
[0:49:33] <%Keyd00d> NOT THE BEES
[0:49:34] <emillionghost> put on the hat
[0:49:34] <rednecknazgul> beadkeeper seems like a chill gig

[0:49:41] <+Taglog7> You can't bring bees in here
[0:49:46] <viviknight> FREE HONEY
[0:49:48] <%TheSniperJoe> Getting into voice over really is just going out and doing it. Everyone started off at the same spot and you NEED to get yourself out there to get the experience to succeed.
[0:49:48] <jorgen57> I just got here whats the topic
[0:49:49] <%JEiddew> people are bees

[0:49:58] <%lewdskeletor13> UTERIN BEES?
[0:50:05] <$TeraMercier> Directly confronting whatever worries you is the best way to bring everything you have to the situation
[0:50:06] <drippygg> you're all misguided
[0:50:07] <leinadtonu> practicing accents with the bees
[0:50:09] <%RedMageRebel> anal bees WutFace
[0:50:10] <%AncelDeLambert> uterine defense hornets
[0:50:14] <rednecknazgul> have you tried scaring the bees away from you by yelling BOO BEES
[0:50:14] <%psychodave1234> ANAL BEES
[0:50:14] <%TheSniperJoe> Soooooo many are shy.
[0:50:14] <emillionghost> I smile and then stutter a bunch lol
[0:50:19] <Travian_Valoris> Voice acting is confidence, so if no confidence, fake confidence is just as good
[0:50:23] <$monkeyhous3> anal bees? thats kinda hot.
[0:50:24] <+Tyonidus> Your mom wasn't shy last night Kappa
[0:50:25] <%Lets_frown> @PeachSaliva Directors and casting agents want you to be in the room more than you think. You know that
[0:50:25] <DesuDesuDokiDoki> Anal Bees!
[0:50:26] <+fatal_penguin_> Anal Beads?
[0:50:27] <+hahaha1171> Bye, going to watch Pat's archive vampire of the masquerade
[0:50:27] <%Bouldus> about anal bees?
[0:50:29] <%starotter70> Don't be afraid of pauses or somewhat awkward moments, for social interaction
[0:50:30] <%tizz86> thank you paige, that really means allot
[0:50:31] <%AncelDeLambert> @PeachSaliva will the bees be in peanut butter sandwiches?
[0:50:37] <Inebriateddonut> I think it was about the anal bees
[0:50:38] <+cereal_box_conspiracy> Anal bees are the worst.
[0:50:38] <%Lets_frown> @PeachSaliva They want you to fill the role that they need
[0:50:39] <%juhbathehutt> damn
[0:50:40] <%starotter70> Damn
[0:50:40] <Dr_Mooose> damn
[0:50:40] <+McSoliace> try to find other shy people, in my experience it works pretty well
[0:50:42] <Plutt_bug> Just pretend everyone shit their pants
[0:50:43] <%ElenaManetta> If you're shy, you can TRANSFER the shy by making EYE CONTACT with random people in the audience.
[0:50:57] <%RedMageRebel> @peachsaliva Matt mercer actually is really open about his body dysmorphia so it's fairly normal among actors
[0:50:57] <mrdink91> !insta
[0:50:58] <%psychodave1234> watch that dude clam up immediately because you called him out
[0:50:59] <alrobot2014> anal bees vs sounding rod bees which would be worse 🤔
[0:51:03] <%juhbathehutt> thats why paige is in porn now
[0:51:05] <Youwereeatenbyalid> Lets frown is WOKE
[0:51:06] <%Lets_frown> lol

[0:51:13] <%dukenux> Voice porn?
[0:51:16] <+Tyonidus> I'm not shy, just realistic about myself. I know people (especially women) don't want to talk to some fat neckbeard about his super niche interests lol. Why would I bother?
[0:51:19] <%psychodave1234> sorry phrased thatwrong
[0:51:22] <Youwereeatenbyalid> Confirmed Matthew Mercer is IN THE CHAT

Audition for stuff, do WALLA, it helps, take classes if only to get you in front of casting directors.

[0:57:19] <Angry_Ev1L> That's cause you have a real job.
[0:57:19] <%TheSniperJoe> cheer500 The best advice I can give to anyone getting into voice over is to simply put yourself out there and do the work. Take classes, it gets you in front of casting directors, do Walla because that's going to give you time in the booth that you need to be more comfortable, and never pass on auditioning for something simply because you didn't feel good enough. When you're casting for something you have an idea of the thing you need and YOU could be it, so do it, have faith in yourself.

[0:59:51] <%TheSniperJoe> @Paradocks23 Walla is essentially the backing track for dubs, characters in the background of a scene that add ambience. I'll be real, it pays shit but it WILL put you in the booth with others and that kind of experience is invaluable.

[1:18:46] <%dukenux> @PeachSaliva BTW If you still want to play SR in the future: Many people recommend decker, but imho you can start with differenct class(like shaman for example, cause only your main can make use of that charisma stat in dialogues), since you can recruit a good decker for your team early in the game.
[1:18:48] <$TeraMercier> Yup, remember to change the game reminder
[1:18:49] <Youwereeatenbyalid> @PeachSaliva shadowrun one day though, right? Sorry for nagging on about it
[1:18:49] <+Archphronimos> It wouldn't be an authentic PeachSaliva stream if it wasn't a mess!

[1:38:59] <$ScrapSentinel> Vivvy is better
[1:39:00] <Mr_Jumbles> thief implies ITEM or PROPERTY (instead of kidnapper) ... so princess/woman = property? Kappa

[1:39:18] <%Keyd00d> You don't get FF like this no mo
[1:39:19] <SoFarFetched> This was a weird game to play after seeing the style in FF8
[1:39:19] <+fatal_penguin_> Final Fantasy 9: Garnet is 18, We Swear
[1:39:19] <%QueequegTheater> WoolieYe
[1:39:22] <koffeemancer> he may be an asshole thief, but skypirates though.
[1:39:24] <%RafflesiaA> @pkmamsters We took the 3rd option, FF9
[1:39:24] <CptBritches> THE GUCH
[1:39:27] <SoFarFetched> cause I had no idea each game was different styles
[1:39:27] <Travian_Valoris> @pkmamsters democracy doesn't matter

[1:52:51] <SoFarFetched> it's been years since I last played FF9
[1:52:53] <BourneWarrior> So is Vivi just a guy that never takes off his hat?

[1:53:39] <%JEiddew> hrrrnng i keep trying to protect the princess but i'm dummy thicc and the clap of my ass cheeks keeps alerting the thieves

[1:53:43] <%Ell1ot> oh no! he's upset
[1:53:44] <$lotharrio> Steiner! Secret hero of the game!
[1:53:47] <+KerNasia> God everything about this is just pure nostalgia
[1:53:52] <LiquidMathew> I was thinking Fuggins was a strong choice
[1:53:52] <Tampaoster> thicc evil
[1:53:53] <$jobbedbone> BARA IS PURE
[1:53:56] <HanPaul> Steiner best theme
[1:53:58] <+thesw1tch> this takes me back. these are terrible graphics
[1:53:58] <%MightyMaxT> Okay, so I haven't finished FF9, Is it a that lady really Garnet's mother? Or is that spoilers?
[1:54:00] <%mercado94> I remember this dissidia 012 stage
[1:54:00] <sdgundum990> Garnet needs a man
[1:54:01] <SoFarFetched> Paige will probably love Beatrix a lot KappaPride

[1:54:24] <%MightyMaxT> Gotcha. Thanks, chat
[1:54:27] <%Breakfast_Megapowers> PogChamp Violence
[1:54:30] <+KENTASHIRO> Did I miss the fencing bit?
[1:54:33] <%Ell1ot> is this play a foreshadow?
[1:54:35] <%mercado94> YES
[1:54:37] <+krispen_wa> GOOD SONG
[1:54:38] <LiquidMathew> Fencing in a minute
[1:54:41] <FatherGreyBeard> How is the fencing QTEs gonna work
[1:54:44] <+thesw1tch> I cant wait. at this rate, ffxvi is going to be vr
[1:54:52] <+KENTASHIRO> oh good I didn't, sweet. Fencing minigame is the best
[1:54:52] <$lotharrio> Additionally, that's a good name for a play.
[1:54:53] <TheCitizenStreamer> This OST is Uematsu in his prime
[1:54:54] <HanPaul> Blanc is a patchwork zombie
[1:54:56] <%mercado94> @Ell1ot naaaaaah dont worry about it Kappa
[1:54:58] <%MaximumDaximum> Oh, I really wonder how the fencing section is going to go
[1:55:00] <%spiritofmojave> This song is solid sipsipGasm
[1:55:04] <SomersaultJustice> OHHHH MARIAAAAAA
[1:55:04] <+SimplesRock> I may be going to sleep soon, but I am really enjoying this (and I never played any FF). Glad you’re back to streaming and voicing:)
[1:55:06] <+ItsRatman> 6 / 5 voice acting
[1:55:06] <cerberuscarmine> AYE
[1:55:07] <+thesw1tch> spoilers*
[1:55:08] <%Breakfast_Megapowers> This is so stupid having a company of thieves putting on a play
[1:55:08] <LiquidMathew> Place your bets for how many nobles impressed
[1:55:10] <Angry_Ev1L> poorly
[1:55:10] <TheCitizenStreamer> Probs his masterp
[1:55:12] <jorgen57> ff9 remake everyone
[1:55:13] <%StarkMaximum> Hot take: Zidane is one of the best Final Fantasy protagonists if only because he's a cute and cheerful boy
[1:55:17] <DracaenaLeaf> What ho
[1:55:22] <FatherGreyBeard> This music is amazing
[1:55:24] <%StarkMaximum> WILL BE CRUSH-ED
[1:55:26] <Luesagna00> so is the main char a super saiyan or sumthing?
[1:55:31] <%Keyd00d> yes
[1:55:32] <%QueequegTheater> This accents are causing physical pain
[1:55:37] <%RafflesiaA> Nah he just got a tail
[1:55:40] <%dukenux> maybe you can slow down dialogues in options
[1:55:40] <$lotharrio> START STEALING!
[1:55:41] <LiquidMathew> I love that they have sfx to use
[1:55:44] <%mercado94> oh boy
[1:55:46] <%Breakfast_Megapowers> We are all Saiyans
[1:55:50] <%MaximumDaximum> @Breakfast_Megapowers They're officially a theater troupe.
[1:55:54] <%Keyd00d> cinna already dead lol
[1:55:57] <%iwishthiswasicq> Oh man, I love the useless SFX.
[1:56:02] <+krispen_wa> Yeyeyeyeye good songs
[1:56:09] <%RoboXGP> this orchestra is pretty elaborate
[1:56:09] <suikudo> Its a show not a fight
[1:56:15] <%MightyMaxT> Man, FF sound effect. They NEVER get old.
[1:56:16] <sdgundum990> IT"S JOHN CINNA!!
[1:56:21] <+ItsRatman> You killed him. Hes dead
[1:56:23] <%StarkMaximum> I like how this is being billed as a play right down to your magic being "special effects" and yet you can legit just pick-pocket your manager and take his wallet
[1:56:24] <Ilsee16> I just woke up how long has Paige been streaming?
[1:56:24] <+KENTASHIRO> This is super jank
[1:56:28] <%Breakfast_Megapowers> I never knew Criminals could excel at being tremendous thespians
[1:56:33] <Laironx3> Magic is SFX for this one moment
[1:56:34] <%QueequegTheater> Why wouldn't you just make it fucking turn-based
[1:56:47] <jorgen57> start cheating
[1:56:50] <SoFarFetched> 3 hours ago
[1:56:55] <LiquidMathew> I wonder how successful they'd be if they just became full time traveling theater
[1:56:56] <jorgen57> chaet and accomplish nothing
[1:56:57] <%Breakfast_Megapowers> Because ATB rules
[1:56:59] <Travian_Valoris> I have no understanding of what is happening
[1:57:00] <Darthwaffler> I'm not gonna lie. I just turned on the 9999 damage option for this fight on the switch, because story.
[1:57:01] <SoFarFetched> at ;least according to my email
[1:57:05] <fiercefiresoul> You wouldn't make it turn-based because ATB was the shit back then.
[1:57:07] <%QueequegTheater> I have the same irrational hatred for ATB Pat has for most things
[1:57:08] <%mercado94> the kids love ATB!
[1:57:10] <Dr_Mooose> is that a union jack on his shirt?
[1:57:15] <%QueequegTheater> ATB SUCK
[1:57:16] <Tampaoster> wholesome stream XD
[1:57:19] <%StarkMaximum> @Travian_Valoris This is just a tutorial battle to get you used to the system tbh
[1:57:19] <%MaximumDaximum> I think the mouse and keyboard controls are somewhat based off the touch controls from the Android version
[1:57:20] <Intolerable> Who names their kid "BLANK"
[1:57:23] <%Breakfast_Megapowers> Chrono Trigger proves that ATB is the shit
[1:57:23] <%iwishthiswasicq> Can't you turn ATB off though?
[1:57:29] <+krispen_wa> ATB is for dumb fast-thinking people
[1:57:34] <%QueequegTheater> ATB is always shit
[1:57:37] <Yeajow> I mean you can just play in wait mode
[1:57:38] <grayjammer> ATB is the worst thing about this game
[1:57:38] <%mercado94> Princess Cornelia eh?
[1:57:40] <SomersaultJustice> THEME OF RANGED DPS Kappa
[1:57:44] <Xeno351> yeah patty you fuck
[1:57:45] <LiquidMathew> Of 100 nobles ? were impressed, place your bets
[1:57:46] <$lotharrio> OH SNAP!
[1:57:49] <%MaximumDaximum> I love this track
[1:57:51] <$lotharrio> I love this part.
[1:57:52] <+krispen_wa> yeyeyyeyeyeyeye sword fight
[1:57:53] <suikudo> I dont like FF9 but i lvoe this song
[1:57:54] <%Breakfast_Megapowers> Oh god not violence
[1:57:55] <HanPaul> ATB is suck. getting rid of it was the only thing FFX did right 4Head
[1:57:58] <FatherGreyBeard> Inititative style turn based is the best RPG system to be honest
[1:57:59] <Luesagna00> woah wat..its like ffx-2 and battles doesnt pause o.0
[1:57:59] <%StarkMaximum> "Queen Brahne was not impressed."
[1:58:01] <%RafflesiaA> I hate ATB and wish it was gone forever
[1:58:03] <%mercado94> @LiquidMathew 20
[1:58:03] <%dukenux> I beat entire CT with ATB on, cause i thought its how supposed to be played LUL
[1:58:05] <TheCitizenStreamer> 100 baby
[1:58:05] <Tummzer> I just got here, closed the tab, heard Page say Blank and assumed she was censoring herself.
[1:58:06] <+krispen_wa> 100 NOBLES PAIGE
[1:58:11] <+ItsRatman> good luck paige
[1:58:14] <%QueequegTheater> I like Lightning Farron's design a LOT

[1:58:19] <HanPaul> LUL
[1:58:19] <%Keyd00d> YEAH DO IT
[1:58:20] <%MaximumDaximum> That COULDN'T be more confusing!
[1:58:21] <%QueequegTheater> I have a weakness for pink hair
[1:58:21] <Tummzer> THE GEARS
[1:58:21] <%spiritofmojave> THAT'S TERRIBLE
[1:58:22] <Manly_BeardedOne> well shit

[1:59:38] <DracaenaLeaf> oof
[1:59:39] <+Deano8817> 56 chat members imprrdsed
[1:59:40] <Luesagna00> The sun has set!
[1:59:41] <%dukenux> DO OVER
[1:59:42] <%iwishthiswasicq> Do it until it's perfect.
[1:59:42] <Ricochet0> yes
[1:59:42] <changtasia> yes
[1:59:43] <%StarkMaximum> I think so tbh
[1:59:44] <%dukenux> RESET
[1:59:44] <+Nomicro4u> THIS SETUP IS STRANGE AND HAS ME CONFUSED
[1:59:46] <Ion_Laser> Yes
[1:59:47] <%mercado94> FOR REALSIES
[1:59:48] <Laironx3> 56 people in the chat were impressed
[1:59:50] <%ThePuddingDead> y tho
[1:59:50] <lesbianmimikyu> you got this!
[1:59:54] <LiquidMathew> I love the idea of "oh wait were gonna fight some more"
[1:59:56] <+turtlespence> you can do it!
[1:59:57] <%spiritofmojave> God these Spanish Castanets are so good
[1:59:57] <%Ell1ot> no one asked for an encore
[1:59:58] <%StarkMaximum> The only reason you really did poorly at all is because one or two times you messed up and it resulted in a domino effect
[1:59:59] <$lotharrio> You want good stuff... perfect is a rough goal, though.
[2:00:01] <%Bouldus> i was impressed Kappa
[2:00:01] <Dr_Mooose> run it back
[2:00:02] <Darthwaffler> Go for the money shower!
[2:00:02] <%MaximumDaximum> I think you have to do it perfectly to impress her, right?
[2:00:03] <+fatal_penguin_> I remember playing this on epsxe and this scene on slow speed to get 100 Impressed
[2:00:06] <Whiskey_T_Foxtrot> I like the idea that you're just redoing a scene in front of the same audience expecting them to eventually clap harder.
[2:00:11] <+krispen_wa> Imagine paying to see a live redo of theater
[2:00:20] <%StarkMaximum> I was about to say, imagine if a play happened and the actors came out going "hang on, no, let's do this scene again until you guys like it"
[2:00:23] <+thesw1tch> @abrahamlinlincoln "run that back"
[2:00:24] <%JEiddew> pay extra for the encore
[2:00:27] <%iwishthiswasicq> The time you have to do it is actually pretty lenient.
[2:00:28] <%QueequegTheater> I want my death to be 2B crushing my skull with her thighs while some other stuff is happening I'm not comfortable sharing. We can't have everything
[2:00:29] <Yeajow> sugoiBestgirl
[2:00:34] <%StarkMaximum> "we can't progress until the entire crowd likes it so we get the best items later"
[2:00:36] <%spiritofmojave> Paying for a rehearsal basically
[2:00:36] <%RafflesiaA> Those key choices are seriously awful though
[2:00:53] <%RoboXGP> why didn't they just make this the game??
[2:00:55] <FatherGreyBeard> At least we have a reason to keep listening to this great song
[2:00:58] <%ThePuddingDead> better
[2:01:02] <+Deano8817> Clap
[2:01:02] <%Bouldus> o//

[2:01:11] <%QueequegTheater> C'S GET DEGREES PAIGE

[2:01:11] <%mercado94> FUCKING BITCH
[2:01:11] <%StarkMaximum> Queen Brahne can suck a huge dick, imo!!!
[2:01:13] <Laironx3> screw that binch
[2:01:13] <FatherGreyBeard> FAT EVIL
[2:01:14] <Dr_Mooose> an even C

[2:01:15] <Tampaoster> thicc evil
[2:01:15] <%ThePuddingDead> queen brahne breaks the stream for half a second
[2:01:17] <foreverN2dust> 100% is impossible

[2:01:21] <Luesagna00> aagain!
[2:01:22] <%dukenux> UNGHAAA!
[2:01:31] <Luesagna00> must impress the queen!
[2:01:37] <%QueequegTheater> Patty is a girl's name
[2:01:42] <%iwishthiswasicq> 100% is definitely not impossible. The key choices are really bad though.

[2:01:46] <Xomsabra> dont tell me it froze
[2:01:48] <%Breakfast_Megapowers> Ew

[2:01:50] <fiercefiresoul> I managed to get full 100 on that only once in my life, and that was after attempting the fight five times.
[2:01:50] <FatherGreyBeard> ew
[2:01:51] <BunnyEmperor> MMMH FILTHY
[2:01:52] <Travian_Valoris> piss boots
[2:01:54] <Tummzer> ummm
[2:01:54] <Yeajow> 100 is really possible on the modern versions actually
[2:01:55] <+krispen_wa> Zidane knows that anime characters have to be distinctive
[2:01:56] <%JEiddew> how are your boots wet
[2:01:57] <%ThePuddingDead> so quit yer bitchin patty
[2:01:58] <energywarning> someone didn't powder their armor

[2:02:20] <changtasia> rohypnol
[2:02:20] <%StarkMaximum> Actually I think that's a real-ass thing, some actors refuse to wear helmets that cover their face because it makes them less distinctive
[2:02:21] <%Breakfast_Megapowers> No no no nono
[2:02:21] <+Deano8817> thats fucking illegal zidane

[2:04:46] <+fatal_penguin_> Did you wash your Hands with Mustard for Maximum Disinfecting
[2:04:55] <+krispen_wa> Did Paige pee mustard
[2:04:57] <+Deano8817> yeah
[2:04:58] <$RaikenTB> How did you do it without the noise?
[2:05:07] <%MaximumDaximum> If piss is stored in the balls, how do women hold it in?
[2:05:08] <bubgerboi> that;s canon
[2:05:09] <Tampaoster> Yay
[2:05:18] <Huntercd> Wash hands?
[2:05:19] <%JEiddew> remember that time paige got mustard in the shower and thought pat peed on the wall

[2:05:29] <+Pendragwn> damn that ass
[2:05:31] <%StarkMaximum> You guys, it's none of your business to know whether or not Paige pees mustard. Just assume it's the case like all the rest of us.

[2:05:47] <%QueequegTheater> Sleepy time for Queequeg. Night all. And if I offended you, keep it in your blackmail file. Also never talk to the cops without a lawyer. They can absolutely lie through their fucking teeth to you.
[2:05:48] <fiercefiresoul> The most ineffective armor ever.
[2:05:49] <SomersaultJustice> to be fair I would like an army dressed like cammy
[2:05:51] <+krispen_wa> Don't mess with that white mage
[2:05:52] <%JEiddew> i hate the character models
[2:05:56] <%spiritofmojave> armor is only effective with ass windows
[2:05:57] <+Pendragwn> check her out yeyeye

[2:06:54] <StaticSunrise> is this like when you met the real paddy?
[2:06:54] <+Deano8817> vineStank the hell zidane

[2:07:06] <$lotharrio> Zidane is the coolest womanizer, though!
[2:07:07] <+krispen_wa> Oh snap it's tje discount kefka duo
[2:07:10] <SomersaultJustice> Twincast Meteor
[2:07:11] <CarrotWhisky> @fiercefiresoul It isn't too unreasonable time wise; during the late medieval eras, full plate was ditched to less armor that allowed more movement, especially since fire arms and cannons rendered most armor useless.
[2:07:12] <%StarkMaximum> So
[2:07:15] <%AncelDeLambert> god I hate these two
[2:07:21] <%StarkMaximum> Are these two talking in unison, or do they echo each other?
[2:07:21] <%JEiddew> couldn't they have made zidane 18
[2:07:23] <SomersaultJustice> Jim and Sterling
[2:07:28] <Darthwaffler> How do these guy's go potty?
[2:07:31] <$Agami23> this game feels like everything modern day square enix hates
[2:07:32] <+Deano8817> kill jestah
[2:07:33] <LodiFrostbeard> man this stream is JANKY
[2:07:34] <$kinghats> Cant wait to see these two turn in to HORRIBLE ABOMINATIONS
[2:07:39] <$RaikenTB> The backgrounds look kinda washed out. What happened?
[2:07:50] <Tummzer> alright yoda
[2:07:50] <+krispen_wa> @agami23 you mean being a good game?
[2:08:02] <$jorgamund> this is one of the most annoying versions of this trope
[2:08:05] <$lotharrio> Speak honestly, how often do you translate Pat's speech into their patterns?
[2:08:12] <eldrich_horror> @kinghats shhh spoilers for those who dont know
[2:08:13] <Laironx3> Binch do you live like this?
[2:08:13] <%RoboXGP> this and 12 were the last i tried

[2:08:19] <$lotharrio> Court mages or jesters, yeah.
[2:08:30] <CarrotWhisky> @raikentb I don't think original full resolution background exists; sharper resolution is available with mods, but not fully.
[2:08:31] <%JEiddew> yuckin it up
[2:08:31] <Darthwaffler> Makes sense.
[2:08:33] <+Cheekynandos689> they probably stayed in the basement where they belong

[2:08:46] <$Agami23> @krispen_wa being a good game, being a fantasy style game with magic and castles, having a unique art style besides anime ass anime shit.
[2:08:49] <$RaikenTB> @CarrotWhisky Ah.
[2:08:49] <%RoboXGP> moguri mod cleans it up with neural network AI
[2:08:55] <SomersaultJustice> SQUARE TOO COWARDLY TO PUT HER IN DISSIDIA

[2:09:20] <+krispen_wa> JIGGLE
[2:09:20] <%MaximumDaximum> @RaikenTB Square never archived the original assets, so they had to use less than ideal methods to upscale them.
[2:09:21] <+Pendragwn> garnet

[2:12:02] <Intolerable> Alt+F4
[2:12:04] <%StarkMaximum> do you love how Steiner has shorts on and his boots are only ankle height so you get to see that little glimpse of his dumb legs
[2:12:07] <%Bouldus> huh
[2:12:13] <+Deano8817> V???
[2:12:14] <+ItsRatman> Steiner's giving me some Papyrus vibes, especially with that voice
[2:12:14] <Yeajow> remap it
[2:12:15] <foreverN2dust> @Intolerable you stop that now
[2:12:22] <%MegboyManuel> MegboyManuel subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 4 months, currently on a 4 month streak! oh snap remote stream! Happy you liked the DMC5 artwork btw. Got any fanart requests Paige? Been thinking of what to make you guys next
[2:12:23] <+Deano8817> excuse the fuck me, pc port
[2:12:26] <izaich> Just tuning in. Is this Peach's first time with FF9?
[2:12:27] <%Faustgesicht> Alright out Gnight Paige and chat
[2:12:32] <izaich> It's probably my favourite FF.
[2:12:32] <Laironx3> there's a Save Moogle to the right
[2:12:35] <$lotharrio> The other 6? Doesn't he mean the other five micro knights?
[2:12:40] <%JEiddew> no but her first time on keyboard @izaich
[2:12:42] <$jorgamund> @StarkMaximum they're cargo shorts... but metal
[2:12:42] <Mr_Loboto> Fuggins is looking quite dashing I must say
[2:12:44] <Laironx3> I think
[2:12:52] <BestTeaMaker> oh shit, just got back home
[2:12:58] <BestTeaMaker> ff9 yay
[2:13:10] <CarrotWhisky> I wouldn't mind if FFIX got a remaster with a VA cast like FFXIV's current VAs. Setting and writing seems similar enough.
[2:13:10] <izaich> I was almost done with the game when I realized you could point and click with the PC version.
[2:13:11] <%StarkMaximum> @jorgamund I can't imagine why Steiner would need cargo shorts when he's very clearly the kind of dude who's totally okay with wearing a fanny pack to carry all his stuff in
[2:13:12] <Darthwaffler> Steiner is showing so much ankle. What a scandalous bitch.
[2:13:12] <BestTeaMaker> best ff game, fite me
[2:13:15] <eldrich_horror> @izaich think she said she played it a long time ago
[2:13:24] <+Survivor_Seven> Was this music in ff8?
[2:13:27] <%iwishthiswasicq> Mosh is the pullout king kupo.
[2:13:29] <jo_vo> @bestteamaker Where ** is the muthafuckin ** tea?!
[2:13:31] <%StarkMaximum> Mognet is what you use to catch moogles
[2:13:38] <lloyddboy> wait why is paige out of the peach pit
[2:13:38] <BestTeaMaker> none for you
[2:13:48] <eldrich_horror> @BestTeaMaker i stand with you
[2:13:51] <Yeajow> @survivor_seven nope
[2:13:53] <jo_vo> So these are block chain emails?
[2:14:01] <%JEiddew> @lloyddboy NDA, but heavily implied to be Japan
[2:14:02] <$jorgamund> @StarkMaximum I dunno man, he's the one with baggy below-knee shorts.
[2:14:05] <+krispen_wa> Barbara fucks

[2:14:29] <%ThePuddingDead> notepad that shit
[2:14:29] <Intolerable> tyuvrykyvyur
[2:14:31] <Darthwaffler> Screenshot it.
[2:14:33] <Luesagna00> SCReenshot it!
[2:14:34] <+krispen_wa> Use the power of big cheats. Screenshot it
[2:14:34] <jorgen57> does zitanne fuck???
[2:14:35] <CarrotWhisky> That, and each guard's traits
[2:14:35] <Yeajow> there is yeah
[2:14:35] <%RoboXGP> one of thos does anal
[2:14:35] <$lotharrio> Open up a .txt and wrote it down... vaguely.
[2:14:39] <%JEiddew> also there are 9 of them not 8
[2:14:40] <%StarkMaximum> I mean, hell, you have us, too
[2:14:42] <$Agami23> take a picture on your phone
[2:14:45] <%StarkMaximum> We can go back and rewind the video for you
[2:14:52] <+ItsRatman> you have the internet, you'll be fine
[2:14:54] <+madhattergay> zidane physically cannot fuck
[2:15:02] <%iwishthiswasicq> I bet Vivi fucks.
[2:15:08] <+krispen_wa> Vivi canonically fucked
[2:15:09] <%JEiddew> zidane can fuck me once he's two years older
[2:15:15] <%mercado94> VIVI IS PURE
[2:15:16] <BestTeaMaker> freya fucks Kappa
[2:15:17] <Darthwaffler> Write the names in the note section of the booklet.
[2:15:17] <izaich> I don't think Vivi has any holes.
[2:15:18] <+Deano8817> dont you dare sully vivi's purity
[2:15:21] <+Blargimazombie> FUGGINS
[2:15:33] <+madhattergay> vivi can and will fuck
[2:15:35] <%StarkMaximum> There's nothing in the game that says black mages DON'T reproduce via budding
[2:15:35] <jo_vo> Not like there's this massive apparatus constructed from information and interconnected computers that provides answers at the speed of thought.
[2:15:39] <BestTeaMaker> when do we get burmecians in ff14
[2:15:39] <%RoboXGP> saturday is named after some pedo frog
[2:15:44] <Mr_Loboto> This music sounds like a fat symphony
[2:15:55] <%MegboyManuel> Why isnt Paige dungeon streaming?
[2:15:57] <$kinghats> controller?
[2:16:00] <fiercefiresoul> Best buy yo'self a cheap PC controller.
[2:16:04] <%iwishthiswasicq> I never could tell if Steiner was fat or buff.
[2:16:06] <Yeajow> just use a controller when you can
[2:16:06] <Laironx3> CLANG CLANG
[2:16:07] <%MaximumDaximum> Maybe check the settings to see if there's an auto run option?
[2:16:12] <+arfafax> @MegboyManuel She moved to Japan (?)
[2:16:13] <izaich> hes fat buff
[2:16:16] <+Deano8817> @megboymanuel tldr shes in japan for her job
[2:16:18] <BestTeaMaker> steiner is bara
[2:16:19] <$kinghats> Pat has like A MILLION controllers, I'm sure he could spare ONE
[2:16:23] <+krispen_wa> The tone and presentation of this game is so...Final Fantasy. It's something that's definitely been lost over time
[2:16:23] <CarrotWhisky> How sensitive are we with spoilers btw? Are we ok with discussing future characters and events of this game?
[2:16:27] <%JEiddew> only the gold controller
[2:16:28] <fiercefiresoul> No, Pat needs them all.
[2:16:33] <%MegboyManuel> Damn, that phat japanese stream
[2:16:35] <%iwishthiswasicq> Paige has beaten this game, so it's probably fine.
[2:16:37] <Travian_Valoris> @MegboyManuel in [REDACTED] for work
[2:16:43] <SomersaultJustice> Queen Beryl will be displeased
[2:16:50] <%iwishthiswasicq> I mean, I haven't beaten it, but it's fucking older than me, so who cares?
[2:16:51] <Intolerable> I'm wiped. Goodnight @PeachSaliva
[2:16:55] <%StarkMaximum> @krispen_wa Yeah this game was designed specifically to be as old school Final Fantasy as possible, since 7 and 8 had taken the series in such a wildly different direction
[2:16:56] <%JEiddew> @CarrotWhisky i mean i personally have no experience with the game but i imagine if people are watching they don't mind
[2:17:01] <Darthwaffler> She's in Liam for work?
[2:17:04] <+arfafax> @Intolerable Press Alt+F4 to sleep
[2:17:14] <izaich> wait

[2:17:54] <%iwishthiswasicq> YO, THAT'S COOL..
[2:17:54] <+madhattergay> the pluto knights are suck shit tier theyre lower than the basic guards of alexandria
[2:17:58] <%iwishthiswasicq> I never noticed that.

[2:31:47] <$RaikenTB> Stop stealing my shit WutFace
[2:31:49] <%StarkMaximum> Will no one stop this monster???
[2:31:50] <izaich> The reason Steiner never takes off his armour is because you stole all his street clothes.
[2:31:50] <Travian_Valoris> stole his trilbe
[2:31:52] <+Lokieda> What, you dont wear 2 hats?

[2:32:40] <%StarkMaximum> One of them just popped up on screen for a few frames and they kinda looked like a cricket or a beetle
[2:32:40] <Darthwaffler> The leather may just be the liner of his metal hat.

[2:36:09] <+arfafax> AngelThump
[2:36:11] <%MegboyManuel> who's talking?
[2:36:12] <+ItsRatman> oh no i cant grab the tiddies no more!
[2:36:14] <DracaenaLeaf> that jiggle
[2:36:14] <BestTeaMaker> setting up the entire game as a play is great
[2:36:15] <+pkmamsters> jiggle physics
[2:36:17] <@mothmandraws> cant believe pats moms in a game
[2:36:17] <changtasia> JIGGLE PHYSIC
[2:36:19] <Darthwaffler> Fat Evil.
[2:36:22] <Flare3500> Beatrix best girl don't @ me
[2:36:23] <%SaltyDongs> Wah wah
[2:36:24] <%MegboyManuel> LOL MOTHMAN
[2:36:26] <%ThePuddingDead> stop...shaking
[2:36:29] <%Ell1ot> shake it lady!
[2:36:30] <+arfafax> loreStab
[2:36:30] <%RoboXGP> I can't hear the tears over the sound of those thicc armors clanging
[2:36:38] <mayorrev> moth why
[2:36:42] <+captain_elsewhere> anyone think queen brahne looks like blue cartman ?
[2:36:43] <+Lokieda> Skrrrrrt
[2:36:44] <%JEiddew> NYOOM
[2:36:45] <RadSuit> Cheese it, it's the fuzz!
[2:36:48] <%salty_syd913> wow
[2:36:48] <+krispen_wa> I never really appreaciated ff9's charm until i got older. Now it feels like a gem in the rough with how whimsy it can get
[2:36:49] <+FloorBurger> jiggle physics
[2:36:50] <%Breakfast_Megapowers> FOOL
[2:36:52] <%ThePuddingDead> if it wasnt moth i'd have said it too...
[2:36:52] <izaich> FF9 was really refreshing after the darker themes from 7 and 8. It's far more whimsical.
[2:36:53] <Laironx3> Fuck you Puck
[2:37:00] <%ThePuddingDead> its too easy
[2:37:04] <%Ell1ot> he had time to run back and call Emlo an idiot!
[2:37:07] <+arfafax> loreHeal 🔥 loreStab
[2:37:08] <Yeajow> get em emlo
[2:37:11] <%ThePuddingDead> OH SHIT
[2:37:11] <BestTeaMaker> tbh, 7 was actually a lot more whimsical than people give it credit for
[2:37:13] <%salty_syd913> whelp
[2:37:14] <suikudo> Damnit Emlo
[2:37:16] <zamzoph> Kreygasm
[2:37:17] <+krispen_wa> I can't believe Cornelia just fucking burned to death
[2:37:20] <BestTeaMaker> but 9 definitely is a love letter to camp
[2:37:21] <%MegboyManuel> why is a blackmage walking around, and where are it's leylines
[2:37:26] <DracaenaLeaf> burn
[2:37:27] <fiercefiresoul> FF9 is whimsical until you start getting deeper into the game. Then it's both whimsical and strangely down-to-Earth with the kinf of crazy stuff that goes down.
[2:37:28] <izaich> 7 Did have some whimsical parts, absolutely.
[2:37:29] <Yeajow> @arfafax omg LUL
[2:37:29] <+pkmamsters> Unfollowed
[2:37:30] <%ThePuddingDead> you's a bitch
[2:37:30] <%iwishthiswasicq> Yeah Fugginz, go home!
[2:37:32] <Darthwaffler> Cheese it!
[2:37:35] <jorgen57> its about time we fuck out of here
[2:37:38] <CarrotWhisky> @bestteamaker Crossdress Cloud Kappa
[2:37:38] <Flare3500> FF7 was so whimsical remember the first 5 minutes of it was terrorist bombing
[2:37:39] <@mothmandraws> RIP
[2:37:41] <BestTeaMaker> down to earth and also existential af
[2:37:42] <Fuggins4U> BibleThump BibleThump
[2:37:47] <izaich> But then you have Sephiroth really bringing down the mood.
[2:37:48] <@mothmandraws> cant believe vivi killed garnet
[2:37:50] <Luesagna00> have no idea the atmosphere of this game is so different than other ff games i've seen
[2:37:52] <izaich> Also eco-terrorists.
[2:38:02] <%JEiddew> brah
[2:38:05] <BestTeaMaker> there's an entire theme around existentialism and identity crisis written throughout this game, and it's great
[2:38:08] <fiercefiresoul> True 'dat, BestTea.
[2:38:15] <%JEiddew> it's super cute so far
[2:38:16] <suikudo> I remember thinking that FF7 was very terrorist esque
[2:38:22] <+krispen_wa> this game is pretty similar in atmosphere to earlier games like FFV and FF3
[2:38:24] <suikudo> But then it went kind off the rails
[2:38:26] <Yeajow> @izaich kuja just brings up the mood haha
[2:38:28] <Darthwaffler> Fugginz with the heel turn.
[2:38:29] <%RoboXGP> just in case you liked load times they're back, just in case you liked load times they're back
[2:38:30] <+ItsRatman> this game says more about androids than detroit: become human
[2:38:31] <$RaikenTB> Was this the first FF to do four person parties?
[2:38:40] <+ItsRatman> kind of
[2:38:43] <Flare3500> FF1 had 4 person parties
[2:38:45] <$RaikenTB> No wait, the original FF totally did...
[2:38:47] <BestTeaMaker> no, 4-person parties were common in the series
[2:38:48] <izaich> @BestTeaMaker Every character in FF9 is trying to discover themselves in a different way. Even the villain!
[2:38:48] <+krispen_wa> Vivi: Become Black Mage
[2:38:59] <%MegboyManuel> Emlo use your leylines!
[2:39:04] <Flare3500> FF7 rolled back to 3 person party for no reason
[2:39:04] <$SiameseSneeze> Zidane: Become fuckboy
[2:39:09] <%RafflesiaA> 5 and 3 person parties are the outliers
[2:39:14] <BestTeaMaker> @izaich the best part is that you can see everyone's idealized identity in their Trance state, which look damn impressive with these new models
[2:39:17] <%RafflesiaA> 5 moreso I believe
[2:39:22] <+krispen_wa> I can't believe Vivi melted Steiner alive
[2:39:24] <%JEiddew> 'TIS BUT A FLESH WOUND
[2:39:29] <%MaximumDaximum> GET IT!?
[2:39:33] <izaich> That's right! I forgot that was what Trance was.
[2:39:39] <Travian_Valoris> What are you gonna do bleed on me?!
[2:39:40] <%iwishthiswasicq> So Zidane's ideal is him fully naked.
[2:39:48] <BestTeaMaker> pretty much Kappa
[2:39:51] <DracaenaLeaf> woooooooooooooow
[2:39:53] <+krispen_wa> Oh shit i never realized that about trance
[2:39:57] <%MegboyManuel> damn, cinematics hold up till today, art style i guess
[2:39:58] <@mothmandraws> his clothes are weighted training gear
[2:40:01] <Flare3500> This was fucking lit back in the day year 2000
[2:40:03] <%RafflesiaA> Zidane's ideal is super saiyan 4, like any good monkey
[2:40:04] <izaich> Vivi's is having a fully erect hat.
[2:40:05] <changtasia> how did Brahne have a daughter like Garney anyway
[2:40:09] <changtasia> genetics
[2:40:11] <+krispen_wa> Zidane became the SSj4 he always want to be until Toriyama retconned it
[2:40:12] <%JEiddew> why do they even have those dragonkillers on the castle
[2:40:12] <%SaltyDongs> oh shit
[2:40:13] <@mothmandraws> Brahne fucks
[2:40:17] <BestTeaMaker> @changtasia uh....you'll see
[2:40:19] <Ion_Laser> square knows how to do some good CGI
[2:40:20] <+DrunkenDice> facts
[2:40:24] <%RoboXGP> got dang
[2:40:27] <$RaikenTB> Pre-rendered Kreygasm
[2:40:29] <suikudo> Square and CG was the hotness
[2:40:29] <+krispen_wa> I can't believe they just killed all those people
[2:40:29] <%salty_syd913> all that property damage
[2:40:30] <%Breakfast_Megapowers> This is still awesome
[2:40:30] <%MegboyManuel> the cutscene still holds up due to the art style.
[2:40:32] <%salty_syd913> dang
[2:40:32] <%RoboXGP> is this astral chain?>
[2:40:37] <jorgen57> they are all dead they are all fucking dead
[2:40:38] <Ion_Laser> it holds up like Reboot
[2:40:39] <%mercado94> this is still the hypest shit
[2:40:43] <+arfafax> 💣
[2:40:44] <%Keyd00d> A BOMB
[2:40:46] <@mothmandraws> nostalgia
[2:40:46] <Laironx3> Bomb weaponized
[2:40:46] <%Ell1ot> Bomb!
[2:40:48] <+krispen_wa> Bomb omb motherfucker
[2:40:49] <@mothmandraws> I love this
[2:40:51] <%MegboyManuel> oh fuck a bomb?! Get the blue mages
[2:40:52] <suikudo> .... damn bombs
[2:40:53] <Flare3500> ff7 and ff8 aged like milk , while 9 aged like fine wine thanks to its artstyle
[2:40:56] <theshillman> Oh my god JC a bomb!
[2:40:57] <zamzoph> oh my god JC a bomb! D:
[2:41:00] <$SiameseSneeze> SourPls
[2:41:03] <BestTeaMaker> btw, if people are interested, you guys should go watch the FF9 Speedruns of this game
[2:41:06] <%JEiddew> GROW
[2:41:07] <DracaenaLeaf> Bomb didn't even get hit whoa
[2:41:12] <%mercado94> a JC Bomb!!!
[2:41:12] <BestTeaMaker> the one from the last AGDQ was fantastic
[2:41:16] <fiercefiresoul> FF7 is still good, but FF9 is still up there for me.
[2:41:24] <%RoboXGP> Megaman x 1-4 are on sale right now on greenman
[2:41:25] <%RafflesiaA> Fugginz stop hitting emlo
[2:41:26] <+krispen_wa> This is seriously making me want to replay this game
[2:41:27] <Fuggins4U> wut
[2:41:29] <+arfafax> @BestTeaMaker The blindfolded menuing lobosGasm
[2:41:34] <Fuggins4U> sorry i got my earpods on
[2:41:38] <suikudo> FF7 is to much of a chore Crisis core is great if you can get your hands on it
[2:41:46] <%JEiddew> 8 health
[2:41:46] <%MegboyManuel> this blackmage sucks, no leylines, no commend
[2:41:47] <BestTeaMaker> the most impressive part of the blindfold menuing was he fixed his mistakes at the same time
[2:41:47] <izaich> I like FFs 7-10. I've never tried the earlier ones, sue/fight me.
[2:41:48] <DracaenaLeaf> bomb gonna blow
[2:41:51] <@mothmandraws> heug
[2:41:53] <Darthwaffler> It's crazy how this castle is equipped with a dragonator.
[2:41:56] <+krispen_wa> Crisis Core has Genesis though, which automatically brings it down
[2:41:56] <changtasia> if you hack Garnet's MP to be max at the start, can she actually do the summons?
[2:42:01] <%iwishthiswasicq> I bet being a knight is real hard job to get through without music.
[2:42:03] <%MaximumDaximum> how do you make a spell hit all targets with keyboard and mouse?
[2:42:04] <zeif00> holy shit Paige is still going
[2:42:16] <%RoboXGP> still rep sets
[2:42:18] <+DrunkenDice> hit the deck lytGULP
[2:42:18] <%SomeBlackGui> GO TO BED PAIGE ITS 3 IN THE MORNING
[2:42:20] <%RoboXGP> bomb set
[2:42:24] <$SiameseSneeze> Goddammit Steiner
[2:42:26] <Yeajow> I really wish they didnt put gackt in crisis core
[2:42:26] <BestTeaMaker> here's a great moment of storytelling in ff9, where Garnet is unable to summon
[2:42:30] <%Keyd00d> STAY UP
[2:42:32] <+krispen_wa> THICC bomb
[2:42:35] <BestTeaMaker> no one really mentions it or outright points it out
[2:42:38] <%RoboXGP> who dat boi
[2:42:39] <+GenesisPatton> Oi Peach. Is this a blind run, or have you played this before?
[2:42:40] <%RafflesiaA> @izaich Should try them one day, 3-6 are all pretty good
[2:42:40] <BestTeaMaker> it's just there in her battle menu
[2:42:48] <%RoboXGP> boom like so thicc
[2:42:50] <+arfafax> @some_random_variable It's 4PM where she is
[2:42:51] <zamzoph> I can't believe they're all fucking dead
[2:42:54] <changtasia> yeah but if you hack it to be max MP can she do it?
[2:42:57] <%Clamydomonas> Clamydomonas subscribed with Twitch Prime. 
[2:42:57] <@mothmandraws> this song
[2:43:01] <BestTeaMaker> technically yes
[2:43:01] <%SaltyDongs> Princess slaughtered
[2:43:05] <$Agami23> what if that bomb just killed the princess?
[2:43:06] <Darthwaffler> Epic!
[2:43:09] <BestTeaMaker> because it's just an mp gate iirc
[2:43:09] <+krispen_wa> MILLIONS DEAD
[2:43:10] <%Ell1ot> what was her plan? the princess is on there too
[2:43:11] <%MegboyManuel> damn this is beautiful
[2:43:12] <Laironx3> I like the idea of a Theater airship
[2:43:13] <+ItsRatman> yikes that collateral damage
[2:43:17] <jorgen57> man of stell this bitch
[2:43:18] <$RaikenTB> The people in that house are dead LUL
[2:43:20] <Flare3500> The PC has an HD mod and makes Beatrix a permanent party member
[2:43:29] <%MegboyManuel> just an amazing art style
[2:43:29] <Luesagna00> is this game like 20 yrs old?
[2:43:30] <+krispen_wa> >permanent Beatrix
[2:43:30] <%RoboXGP> this looks like bravely default a lot
[2:43:31] <changtasia> @Ell1ot well it's a smart bomb
[2:43:32] <%ThePuddingDead> that is so creepy looking
[2:43:33] <%SomeBlackGui> holy, the setup is different than the dungeon usually, change of place?
[2:43:34] <@mothmandraws> this game has one of the highest civilian death counts in final fantasy for such a charming artstyle
[2:43:38] <Darthwaffler> All those missed cards...
[2:43:39] <+krispen_wa> Permanent BEatrix is NUT
[2:43:43] <izaich> Can't you go back to the house you destroyed?
[2:43:49] <BestTeaMaker> this game is about genocide Kappa
[2:43:49] <%RoboXGP> thought i was having a seizure
[2:43:52] <%RoboXGP> it just ended
[2:43:53] <%RafflesiaA> It's fine, tetra master is ass anyway
[2:43:55] <%iwishthiswasicq> "Queen Brahne, are you sure we should fire the bomb? Thousands of lives would be in danger." "FUCK EM"
[2:43:55] <%RoboXGP> so abruptly
[2:43:59] <+arfafax> @SomeBlackGui Japan apparently
[2:44:03] <%Clamydomonas> Paige with the sipsipDab EU STream Time sipsipDab
[2:44:05] <BestTeaMaker> tetra master is....alright.
[2:44:06] <%yet_another_brony> f
[2:44:09] <%SaltyDongs> f
[2:44:11] <+krispen_wa> FF8 is redeemed by triple triad, FF9 is brought down by tetra master
[2:44:14] <izaich> @BestTeaMaker no, no, no, its about sustainable de-population
[2:44:16] <$RubberFistFight> oh hey peach you're still streaming
[2:44:18] <%MegboyManuel> i love the airship design with the stupid lil helicopter towers
[2:44:20] <%ThePuddingDead> like, dont get me wrong, i think the cutscenes look phenomenal, but the character designs are just jarring and creepy
[2:44:20] <@mothmandraws> its time for the bois
[2:44:21] <%salty_syd913> she 100 percent tried to kill her daughter
[2:44:21] <BestTeaMaker> nah, you can ignore tetra master for most of the game
[2:44:22] <%MaximumDaximum> I really like that Garnet acknowledges how much the party's actions are harming other people and questions if it's worth it.
[2:44:22] <%JEiddew> she knew the risks when she installed the massive bomb cannon behind her throne
[2:44:23] <DracaenaLeaf> the fat eviiiiil
[2:44:28] <%mercado94> oh shit
[2:44:36] <%iwishthiswasicq> Tetra Master is awful because of it's randomized shit.
[2:44:43] <%Ell1ot> then why did she throw a bomb at her?!
[2:44:45] <%RafflesiaA> Don't you need to play tetra master for one of the zodiac things?
[2:44:45] <rubbishbinge> holy moly, one conference later and the stream is still going?
[2:44:45] <%MegboyManuel> she is absolutely fat evil, david cage why
[2:44:48] <$RubberFistFight> Paige stern face activate :|
[2:44:50] <%RoboXGP> not her real mom?
[2:45:01] <fiercefiresoul> Tetra Master would've been an absolute slam-dunk if it wasn't a randomized game.
[2:45:01] <BestTeaMaker> Garnet is a great female lead
[2:45:02] <+krispen_wa> Garnet is one of the better heroines in this series
[2:45:03] <%mercado94> garnet is great
[2:45:07] <Flare3500> I really like Zidane's crew
[2:45:08] <@mothmandraws> are there any bad characters in 9
[2:45:09] <fiercefiresoul> Like, actual RNG.
[2:45:13] <izaich> Almost every character undergoes development over the game, it's great.
[2:45:15] <%salty_syd913> the ships drunk
[2:45:20] <BestTeaMaker> Gilgamesh was sorely underused
[2:45:22] <+krispen_wa> Adamant is a meh character i guess
[2:45:25] <Ion_Laser> Prima Vista is BIG Drunk
[2:45:29] <%iwishthiswasicq> Funny enough, I like Zidane the least out of all the cast. I never beat the game though.
[2:45:31] <@mothmandraws> adamant suffers from showing up really late
[2:45:33] <@mothmandraws> but hes fine
[2:45:38] <zamzoph> @peachsaliva but how does Garnet compare to Lunafreya Kappa
[2:45:41] <BestTeaMaker> actually, I'd argue Amarant's role is fine
[2:45:49] <$SiameseSneeze> Zidane is too much of a fuckboy for me, but the rest of the cast I enjoy
[2:45:52] <Flare3500> Replace Adamant with Beatrix
[2:45:52] <+arfafax> Adamant? LUL Amarant
[2:45:53] <BestTeaMaker> he enters the story at a really good point actually
[2:45:54] <%yet_another_brony> freyas hot tho
[2:45:59] <Luesagna00> for a split second i read his name as "boku"
[2:45:59] <@mothmandraws> nah freya shows up earlier than you think
[2:46:01] <izaich> When I was a kid I loved Amarant.
[2:46:02] <@mothmandraws> when I replayed
[2:46:08] <%salty_syd913> just toss the bodies
[2:46:09] <%Keyd00d> Freya's cool but her role in the story ends really early
[2:46:11] <%salty_syd913> god
[2:46:11] <BestTeaMaker> Freya enters like in the next area
[2:46:16] <+krispen_wa> Freya suffers from having little endgame story
[2:46:19] <BestTeaMaker> well, next kingdom
[2:46:24] <%iwishthiswasicq> But she's cool tho
[2:46:30] <BestTeaMaker> well, her Engame story is helping Zidane cause what else does she have left
[2:46:31] <Darthwaffler> Adamant is going to be named Woolie right... right?
[2:46:38] <$RubberFistFight> that's either a whiteboard or a fridge behind you, i can't tell which LUL
[2:46:42] <%iwishthiswasicq> What else would he be called?
[2:46:43] <+krispen_wa> i mean she peaks early
[2:46:43] <+ItsRatman> we have to get there first
[2:46:47] <Flare3500> After Burmecia Freya doesnt really have much
[2:46:48] <@mothmandraws> quina should be plague, lives in a swamp
[2:46:54] <BestTeaMaker> yes
[2:46:55] <izaich> Name Amarant Virgil.
[2:46:55] <+Pendragwn> I keep thinking of Garnet from Steven Universe
[2:47:01] <Bailey__gaming> @peachsaliva Hey Paige really good to see you hope your doing well
[2:47:02] <%ThePuddingDead> weird
[2:47:05] <@mothmandraws> oh I forgot this system
[2:47:06] <BestTeaMaker> @Flare3500 literally she doesn't have much
[2:47:08] <BestTeaMaker> Kappa
[2:47:14] <%ThePuddingDead> god sakes
[2:47:17] <%MaximumDaximum> It's basically a "meanwhile..." button lol
[2:47:22] <$Agami23> emlo is just monsterkid
[2:47:23] <%RafflesiaA> The cutscene anywhere system
[2:47:28] <+krispen_wa> I've watched enough educational manga to know where that was going
[2:47:34] <%ThePuddingDead> save dat shit
[2:47:35] <Travian_Valoris> Well it's been a long stream and it's late, can't wait till the next HOLD ON xx
[2:47:36] <%iwishthiswasicq> Mosco's the pullout king kupo
[2:47:41] <Luesagna00> ...so u can choose to see whats happening or just skip it?
[2:47:42] <%RoboXGP> i liked this game i really did then just got to the world map and was so bored i quit in the next town
[2:47:46] <%Breakfast_Megapowers> Basically the Insect pit from the Peter Jackson King Kong movie
[2:47:52] <%RafflesiaA> Stream over?
[2:47:52] <$Greezey> peechu
[2:47:54] <Flare3500> I really like this system too , you get to know what the hell others are doing when you're not together
[2:48:02] <%JEiddew> i gotta drop out, gnight paige
[2:48:02] <$RubberFistFight> Ohno i arrived just in time for it to be over.
[2:48:03] <+krispen_wa> the game has an amazing story and atmosphere but i've always hated the combat
[2:48:03] <%ThePuddingDead> so whats the current time where u are paige?
[2:48:06] <BestTeaMaker> it's like a scene that cuts into the gameplay
[2:48:07] <$RubberFistFight> oh well.
[2:48:08] <@mothmandraws> I thought this wasa 100% marathon speed run
[2:48:08] <+arfafax> Get big
[2:48:09] <$Greezey> BIG PEECHU
[2:48:10] <ragasquid> I'm late. did she ever play shadowrun
[2:48:10] <BestTeaMaker> a....cutscene you could say
[2:48:12] <$RubberFistFight> Big paige is big.
[2:48:14] <Darthwaffler> Balloon Paige!
[2:48:15] <%Breakfast_Megapowers> Yeah gurl, blow yourself... up
[2:48:21] <%RafflesiaA> Hey you're on the back layer now
[2:48:22] <%SaltyDongs> sup
[2:48:25] <%MegboyManuel> seems pretty bright there to me
[2:48:36] <+bluemorning104> BUSTED
[2:48:36] <%SaltyDongs> 3 am is more morning bruv

[2:52:53] <%ThePuddingDead> its the lighting
[2:52:57] <Endocrom> She cries acid
[2:52:58] <%MegboyManuel> i've had to stare at your eyes A LOT for fanart, it was uncomfortable
[2:53:00] <$RubberFistFight> @TIME_PUNCHER blue/grey eyes are actually unpigmented - it's due to Rayleigh scattering that they look blue . Same mechanism that makes the sky blue.
[2:53:08] <+hotspur1235> how goes elmo?
[2:53:08] <Darthwaffler> My cousin has one brown and one blue eye like a huskie.
[2:53:13] <IgnusSTV> Eyes look blue.

[2:53:24] <%ThePuddingDead> thats fuckin awesme
[2:53:40] <Darthwaffler> My cousin is anime!
[2:53:48] <+dorthafiq> So er I'm sorry for being out of the lopp but why is she in Japan today?
[2:53:50] <Bailey__gaming> I love Paige as Carmen sandiego, different location every stream, we follow clues to find out
[2:53:54] <$RubberFistFight> Yeah if you look at a blue eyed persons iris under a microscope it's actually kind of yellowish. "Unpigmented" just means it doesn't have much melanin or associated compounds in it.
[2:53:59] <+krispen_wa> Have you realized that you're the supporting NPC to your cousin
[2:54:02] <%RoboXGP> Lady in devil may cry didn't have hetero chroma did she

[3:01:34] <koffeemancer> @peachsaliva Zydrate Anatomy!

[3:02:04] <sileo_patronus> Good morning Paige
[3:02:07] <$RubberFistFight> @TheUndeniableYes "no means no, unless you're a man, which means you can't say it." was basically the thrust of her argument. It was pretty fucked.
