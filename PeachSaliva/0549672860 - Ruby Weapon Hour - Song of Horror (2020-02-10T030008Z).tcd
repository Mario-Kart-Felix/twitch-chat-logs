[0:19:01] <+ArtoriasTheTrenchfighter> Is it cause of the Mascara?
[0:19:03] <RubberFistFight> Pat, eyeliner is for your eyelids to increase the contrast and make your irises stand out more, mascara is to make your eyelashes look plumper.
[0:19:03] <%depressed_skeleton> Whatss the deeeal with Makeuup?

[0:45:10] <%Chichen> SENTIENCE
[0:45:10] <honeyman18> was that a failure of a robot
[0:45:10] <%megabman> money

[0:45:10] <fairore> ah you scared me
[0:45:10] <%generalve> good damn matrix people

[0:45:19] <%ElenaManetta> Si

[0:45:23] <Valdorick> It either fucked up, or just use a code to download the computer AIDs right into us.
[0:45:29] <+OwlLightningMage> That robot wants dick
[0:45:30] <Zaphire_Saucypants> You gonna kill anymore women, @PeachSaliva?
[0:45:31] <%Brojira> One step closer to total control
[0:45:31] <%ElenaManetta> PC controllers suck
[0:45:32] <+Cheese_Whizard> Who's spamming
[0:45:34] <%Ninestempest> MHW does that shit
[0:45:34] <+Tyonidus> I hate that so much
[0:45:36] <%Ninestempest> I fucking hate it
[0:45:51] <%TheMattman1313> Fill it with Pat's head
[0:45:55] <%ElenaManetta> Paige is trying to ask Pat to slide over. Real sly, Paige.
[0:45:58] <%SoFarFetched> PAIGE SITS LIKE A BIG WOMAN
[0:45:59] <$Sphincter_Spelunker> wide boi pat
[0:46:01] <%ssjklyco> Pat takes up more screen
[0:46:01] <+Tyonidus> Or after the game's already started and you plug/unplug a headset or speakers and it doesn't recognize it
[0:46:03] <%NopeBadguy> Pat manspreads
[0:46:06] <trianglehat> Pat, fill out the space
[0:46:07] <+mh9s> knees out for his dick
[0:46:09] <ShichiNoBushi> I like sinking into a corner.
[0:46:10] <+OwlLightningMage> Paige sits like a queen
[0:46:12] <+el_of_house_wood> The question isn’t what the robot has to gain, it’s that it has nothing left to lose. @peachsaliva
[0:46:14] <person181> ewww nerd talk

[0:46:28] <%Brojira> Pat fill so fast tho
[0:46:29] <trianglehat> LUL
[0:46:30] <ShichiNoBushi> Paige uses the rule of thirds.
[0:46:31] <%TheMattman1313> Have Pat lie his down in your lap and use his head as a keyboard mat
[0:46:32] <cureneckbeard> patspread
[0:46:33] <%walternatorz> pat is a liquid
[0:46:34] <%ElenaManetta> this is a pat-centric camera
[0:46:35] <+Cheese_Whizard> Orbspread
[0:46:38] <%Kirby_Sauce> anti-manspreading chairs
[0:46:38] <duke0fspook> Pat is a decoration
[0:46:38] <%Chichen> Pat only fills up a certain height of space
[0:46:40] <Dragon_Batman> The orb brings Fung quiea or however you spell it
[0:46:44] <%hntronium> Pat has large balls and they must not be crushed
[0:46:45] <%SvenHolgersson> If we could suck it in we would
[0:46:47] <%SoFarFetched> Yeah Paige likes her corner
[0:46:51] <%Brojira> Contour To the pat
[0:46:51] <Jetsfantasy> aka not a circle
[0:46:51] <%megabman> the divot in the corner
[0:46:52] <$Sphincter_Spelunker> do you sink into pat's butt groove?
[0:46:53] <misterspotswood> dont kill all the women again
[0:46:53] <%hntronium> So he must spread
[0:46:56] <$SirGO0SE> and a much bigger peepee
[0:46:57] <$Weeabooninja> Vidya gams

[0:47:24] <LiquidMathew> Paige you should play Haunting Ground sometime
[0:47:24] <+logoth_> If you touch the wrong thing fart gas kills you
[0:47:25] <+BigBruthaThunda> the spookiest game
[0:47:25] <%ssjklyco> 20 minutes death timer starts when she takes control of the character.
[0:47:28] <%realm_forge> Paige’s lady murder simulator
[0:47:32] <$Sphincter_Spelunker> spoilers

[0:47:45] <%ElenaManetta> This game is very similar to Clocktower exploration even if not intended
[0:47:46] <%DandyMackeroos> Cock tower which is exactly the opposite of what Pat has.
[0:47:47] <%ElenaManetta> Alexander
[0:47:48] <+blastazoid26> Is this about monsters or ghosts?
[0:47:48] <duke0fspook> Sebastian the Crab?

[0:55:28] <zettig> Tom Cruise in that one movie
[0:55:29] <Hellarussian> there you go
[0:55:29] <Laironx3> Polnareff
[0:55:29] <$ItsRatman> Thats cause they dont poop in the shower
[0:55:30] <+WhereIsWill> no one lives LUL
[0:55:30] <Mister_McDerp> they always check the shower
[0:55:32] <cureneckbeard> pat
[0:55:32] <%Piemono> It's the easiest thing to tell if someone is in the showers
[0:55:32] <Psyramics> Shower is a dead end
[0:55:34] <+lethallylactic> LUL
[0:55:35] <+OwlLightningMage> Until Dawn
[0:55:35] <TheArrow_> i won hide and seek in the shower

[0:55:36] <johnsonbrowner> I usually survive in the shower
[0:55:36] <Dementedpenguin> Ninja Turtles?
[0:55:37] <johnnybelmont_95> Shower is always trap
[0:55:38] <%JackMillerTime> horror movie logic says that shower is a kill zone
[0:55:38] <madskull456> it happens in movies all the time
[0:55:38] <MetroidSlayerP7> lot of people are injured in the bathroom
[0:55:40] <RileyOMalley> Survival Shower
[0:55:41] <%Brojira> IRL no count
[0:55:42] <%BaronVonMagpie> possibly
[0:55:44] <Prevot> shower is only good if you're being chased by a mud monster
[0:55:44] <%JaydenSai> @PeachSaliva Erica seems the most story important, i'd do her first!
[0:55:44] <RubberFistFight> @PeachSaliva MILLA JOVOVICH IN THE FIRST RESIDENT EVIL MOVIE
[0:55:44] <Hellarussian> no
[0:55:45] <Mister_McDerp> closets are best hiding spots
[0:55:47] <trianglehat> because you were the murderer Paige
[0:55:47] <Dragon_Batman> Nah she was bathing
[0:55:48] <Void_The_Dark> @PeachSaliva The Fargo film
[0:55:48] <duke0fspook> I believe in the shower
[0:55:49] <%DesertPenguin> IT'S ALWAYS A REFERENCE TO PSYCHO
[0:55:49] <%rdark_ksu> you friend isn't a professional murderer
[0:55:50] <+JenovasPuppet> You don't know for sure that your friend isn't a murderer.
[0:55:50] <+OwlLightningMage> I don't know

[0:55:54] <honeyman18> The Wagging tail in Undertale
[0:55:56] <Will_The_Soulless> Stay away from Bathrooms since the Shower and the Bathtub killed you
[0:55:56] <Nomad_Scholar> @PeachSaliva every person in horror dies in a shower at some point
[0:55:57] <SilverFaustX> everyone should watch parasite
[0:55:58] <+klassikFrank> Closets are dry showers
[0:55:59] <%goose_attack_almanac> There is a shower joke
[0:56:00] <Zaphire_Saucypants> Under the bed
[0:56:00] <Hellarussian> trapped in the closet
[0:56:00] <LiquidMathew> you have to remember to also crouch while in the shower, killers aim high
[0:56:03] <%ElenaManetta> Daniel or Erica.
[0:56:03] <+necrocannibal2> showers only make the murder more sexy
[0:56:04] <Dragon_Batman> I say Rene
[0:56:04] <Void_The_Dark> Fargo had a shower survival.

[1:11:23] <buerdo> It is literally the games ambient noise
[1:11:24] <%sharpington_> @PeachSaliva I hear a very quiet, very high pitched ambient noise that I think is supposed to be a "spooky sound"
[1:11:24] <$ElkRiverDog> Well this is the woman who taught you to say turkwise
[1:11:25] <%DandyMackeroos> Maybe it’s the sanity being sucked out of our ears
[1:11:25] <goldengrolar> fromage
[1:11:25] <Dhurkst> like, diegetic
[1:11:26] <Broand> I think it's from one of the things ingame

[1:12:47] <zenith0111> Angriest Pat wouldn't have gotten Paige
[1:12:51] <johnsonbrowner> "Ugly old box"
[1:12:55] <leinadtonu> angriestpat chat was cool...
[1:12:57] <oniwahoo> "they just keep on cumming" lewd!
[1:12:58] <+necrocannibal2> is this game set in the 90s or is she just a hipster?
[1:12:59] <%sleepy_coffee> Daym

[1:13:09] <Zaphire_Saucypants> seems fine
[1:13:09] <%theshillman> de bääthroom
[1:13:12] <honeyman18> how much can they possibly have in one store?
[1:13:12] <ShichiNoBushi> FLUSH
[1:13:12] <FirearmsInstructor> @ElenaManetta What a slutty antique shop...
[1:13:16] <%Lunarhawk> mid level evil big pog
[1:13:19] <Hellarussian> somebody's pooping in there
[1:13:20] <Zaphire_Saucypants> iiiinteresting
[1:13:26] <%JaydenSai> Drink the danger @PeachSaliva
[1:13:29] <%Lizard0TM> Grab that gun to shoot the ghost!
[1:13:30] <misterspotswood> its really effective against living things
[1:13:31] <$Sphincter_Spelunker> @FirearmsInstructor no worries, guy SeemsGood
[1:13:31] <%DesertPenguin> Erica is gonna poison herself
[1:13:32] <%starotter70> Time to drink it
[1:13:33] <Mister_McDerp> just spritz the ghost with bleach
[1:13:34] <Zaphire_Saucypants> are we gonna fill that shit with acid?
[1:13:37] <+OwlLightningMage> This Ad is not a lady being murdered by Paige
[1:13:37] <%ElenaManetta> Cause of the box!
[1:13:37] <johnnybelmont_95> Check the toilet for a pig
[1:13:45] <Laecerelius> Don't need to worry about reflections if the mirrors are eerily shattered
[1:13:47] <+necrocannibal2> 'cause of uggos
[1:13:47] <Jetsfantasy> Vampires trying to stop you from finding them
[1:13:47] <%ElenaManetta> The box only shows up in reflections
[1:13:51] <johnsonbrowner> That bottle is how the coronavirus started
[1:13:55] <trianglehat> don't need to draw
[1:13:57] <FirearmsInstructor> @StridentSong Hey man, I hope you're well. notkohWave
[1:13:58] <%sleepy_coffee> I don’t like antique shops, all the things could be haunted
[1:13:59] <%Deadpal> 1. ghosts 2. physics.
[1:13:59] <Hellarussian> or both
[1:14:00] <$Sphincter_Spelunker> what about dead angels
[1:14:00] <Dragon_Batman> Reflections are hard
[1:14:01] <CrimsonCore90> Vampires
[1:14:01] <SkyPirateArcane> Why not both
[1:14:02] <+kujofire990> g
[1:14:04] <%ElenaManetta> In one of the diary entires: The mother specifically breaks all the mirrors because of the music box.
[1:14:05] <leinadtonu> Was angriestpat taller than patstaresat?
[1:14:05] <+OwlLightningMage> How long does a towel need to sit before it gets dusty?
[1:14:05] <%Lunarhawk> The hardest reflection is self reflection
[1:14:06] <%sleepy_coffee> Delicious poison
[1:14:07] <MetroidSlayerP7> mirrors reflect the evil within
[1:14:07] <Zaphire_Saucypants> I think it might be related to the music box being in the reflection
[1:14:07] <Mister_McDerp> lots of bad luck
[1:14:11] <mobiusnightshade> The music box kept appearing in the reflection, according to a note.
[1:14:11] <%jack_is_here> its 100% reflections
[1:14:12] <%SoFarFetched> THAT MEAN THE GHOST IS HERE
[1:14:13] <%Jekado> reflective ghosts
[1:14:18] <Valdorick> Clearly they just don't want to get pulled in Stand Battle.
[1:14:23] <%Lizard0TM> Grab the sword and gun!
[1:14:27] <Mister_McDerp> GUN
[1:14:29] <Dragon_Batman> I think it also might be something related to what they mentioned about the music box looking like it is in the mirror of the other house
[1:14:29] <%ElenaManetta> It's a clever work-a-round for a technical difficulty, HOWEVER, this game is so fucking polished I don't know if they would have problems with reflections.
[1:14:29] <Zaphire_Saucypants> shotgun!
[1:14:34] <+OwlLightningMage> Shoot the children
[1:14:34] <$Sphincter_Spelunker> The Winchester
[1:14:36] <Dhurkst> JACK BAKER
[1:14:39] <ShichiNoBushi> Did this gun belong to Checov at some point?
[1:14:39] <%walternatorz> there's going to be wolves running loose at some point
[1:14:40] <+nooseygoosey> checkov's?
[1:14:43] <honeyman18> I like the idea that whatever it is sees you through mirrors and you must smash them to live.
[1:14:44] <%DesertPenguin> GUN GUN GUN
[1:14:44] <CalderGaming> angriestpat was certainly YOUNGER than patstaresat

[1:16:07] <%sleepy_coffee> Who would buy or sell a cannon?
[1:16:10] <$Sphincter_Spelunker> Patstaresat is a binch. AngriestPat was a chad
[1:16:10] <goldengrolar> How is AngriestPat?
[1:16:14] <Mister_McDerp> on the map
[1:16:14] <+OwlLightningMage> Angriestpat died from the Red Bull.

[1:16:57] <SkyPirateArcane> Pat changed his brand to PatStaresAt
[1:17:01] <Dragon_Batman> Cuz angriest PAt has died and PAt Stares At has now taken his place
[1:17:03] <%Lunarhawk> Letter 1: A
[1:17:05] <Superdandy96> Angriest Pat is the heartless, Pat Stares at is the nobody Kappa
[1:17:05] <%starotter70> @FirearmsInstructor *Rebranding
[1:17:15] <%DandyMackeroos> Or more like AngriestPat faded into a puff of weed smoke
[1:17:21] <%GraceTBM> Pat Stares At is the clone that got back home from Mars
[1:17:27] <FirearmsInstructor> @starotter70 lmao I googled that because I was like "wtf is redbranding"???
[1:17:33] <$Sphincter_Spelunker> use weed to sleep
[1:17:35] <goldengrolar> it makes so much sense

[1:18:58] <+klassikFrank> Reach into the samurai's mouth and you can become the one true shogun of Japan
[1:19:01] <%jack_is_here> I mean she wants to sell herself as an ornament, shes probably not willing to sort documents
[1:19:03] <%sleepy_coffee> Pull some SH 3 katana attacks?
[1:19:07] <%Lunarhawk> we can go like a samurai
[1:19:12] <%starotter70> Ask the Samurai about his foot fetish

[1:21:07] <chhdez> You guys need to eat more fiber, that's all
[1:21:07] <mobiusnightshade> The pillars are what 40k nerds call 'impassable terrain'.
[1:21:08] <%ElenaManetta> Or maybe as a visual indcator to get your bearings
[1:21:08] <%jack_is_here> all the walls are marked
[1:21:13] <FirearmsInstructor> TAKE A LOOK AT THIS! What is this??
[1:21:13] <Lewdyhat> would you not mark structures of a building?
[1:21:16] <%realm_forge> WAMUUUUUUU!

[2:22:13] <+Punchasaur> sawnaek
[2:22:14] <+necrocannibal2> the Brazilian one is pretty good, I've heard it's decent in Europe too
[2:22:17] <Zaphire_Saucypants> depends on the establishment I think @necrocannibal2
[2:22:22] <MetroidSlayerP7> is there a game that has pause screen enemies? that's cheating, right?
[2:22:34] <%yet_another_brony> yet_another_brony subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 16 months! I've been on a pretty good streak of catching you guys live recently. Even if only towards the end, I still gotta watch the vods for what I missed. Still, its a joy to see you! Thanks for catering to my schedule by streaming so late. Mmmm, meeee
[2:22:34] <$Sphincter_Spelunker> The white rustic boots did not get replaced. She just showed of another pair of also hooker boots

[2:23:03] <%DandyMackeroos> @sphincter_spelunker Ah okay. Another pair is always good
[2:23:08] <%hntronium> Did she need pat to do the pee noise?
[2:23:13] <%peachy996> @MetroidSlayerP7 the only pause screen shenanigans I ever heard of was Deadpool talking if you paused his mission in Shattered Dimensions
[2:23:13] <+MoralCompassGaming> Here in Montreal it's sort of a toss up based on which store you go into if your order will get screwed up or not.

[2:39:53] <Zaphire_Saucypants> at least we get flashlight
[2:39:53] <%VashyronM> It should have said something like "You are about to kill Erica. Continue?" @PeachSaliva
[2:39:56] <Dragon_Batman> It showed the camera in 2 cutscenes, I think it's there way of doing it subtle
[2:39:56] <%FirearmsInstructor> Is this going to the same building? I came in SUPER late and only saw the previous lighter girl get murdered.
[2:39:59] <+PanicSwytch> Bless u

[2:51:18] <%SoFarFetched> Cheer100 Cheer100 It's okay, Paige you can blame me for Erica dying on this stream. For a good while I was like, "Those thick doors are gonna mess her up sooner or later" We probably cursed your chances with the women from talking about it earlier. Sophie and Erica forever in our Hearts...oh and Alina too. Let's try to make this playthrough have at least ONE woman survive. Then it will at least be successful in a way.
[2:51:20] <%FirearmsInstructor> GUN IS IMPORTANT
[2:51:21] <Valdorick> They're all alerady dead.
[2:51:21] <%TamsynRRD> HE is shirten
[2:51:22] <%VashyronM> Well, we didn't want Erica to die, but that's over now.
[2:51:24] <+el_of_house_wood> GUN
[2:51:28] <%walternatorz> he's already as good as dead

[2:52:08] <%ElenaManetta> oh you mean SH
[2:52:09] <cant_pick_a_name> it's the code Veronica of silent hill
[2:52:10] <TheArrow_> silent hill 4 is really good a couple of times and then the rest is shit
[2:52:13] <%ElenaManetta> I thought you meant it was a hint for this game's puzzle
[2:52:17] <%ElenaManetta> I was like that's obscure as shit

[3:09:22] <%SoFarFetched> @johnnybelmont_95 yeah this game has a couple of instant death stuff.
[3:09:22] <+yoshiunity> she dead. Some woman with a game controller killed her.
[3:09:23] <%DandyMackeroos> At most Silent Hill only ever did that with a boss
[3:09:24] <%GabeSweetMan> I wouldn't feel as upset about it if you could potentially rescue the previous playable character.
[3:09:27] <%goose_attack_almanac> shoulda double checked
[3:09:29] <Hellarussian> Paige is basically Itachi
[3:09:36] <Dragon_Batman> I wonder if it's there to get really good players
[3:09:37] <%ssjklyco> Is that just Pats shirt?

[3:10:10] <%topendmad> sipsipGasm
[3:10:12] <%ssjklyco> "But my anime tiddies"
[3:10:12] <MetroidSlayerP7> Game teaches you mechanic. Game changes mechanic without educating player. Game punishes player needlessly.

[3:50:17] <+MoralCompassGaming> @THATGUY_789 yeah, as long as you stay under what 45 minutes? Otherwise the meat becomes a mush
[3:50:19] <%maskofmichael> Why not both?
[3:50:20] <+ecolli37108> tart means sour
[3:50:21] <%Neo_Kaiser> Acidic but sweet, like Paige.
[3:50:22] <%SoFarFetched> THE ACIDIC
[3:50:22] <+Zereaux> ITS TART
[3:50:22] <%Niney_Who> Because of its ACIDITY PAT
[3:50:23] <%FirearmsInstructor> It's because of bromelain
[3:50:23] <@SSaryn> BUT THAT'S NOT SWEET THEN, IT'S TART

[3:50:31] <+MoralCompassGaming> Acidity
[3:50:33] <Bustahhwulf> not sour
[3:50:33] <%Niney_Who> I'm DEFENDING PAIGE ON THIS ONE
[3:50:34] <%try_it_sis_> THATS SO SWEET 🥰🥰🥰🥰
[3:50:34] <Dragon_Batman> Yea pretty much
[3:50:35] <$mckraven> tart is a form of sour @peachsaliva
[3:50:36] <%Jekado> its acidicness is why its a digestive!!!!
[3:50:38] <%Pandora_Prime> If Paige gets shot, her blood would burn her attacker
[3:50:40] <trianglehat> they're so sour they digest your innards
[3:50:41] <cureneckbeard> It is acidic, and it is sweeet, and it's nice to eat. Beep beep.
[3:50:41] <+el_of_house_wood> ACID IS LITERALLY WHAT SOUR IS
[3:50:42] <+Lioncock> pineapple is acidic but its not sour tasting
[3:50:42] <$darcfowler1995> Pineapples are acid and sweet
[3:50:43] <%SvenHolgersson> The Paigemaster
[3:50:44] <majindusto> NOT YAY
[3:50:44] <Monkeyweed21> HOW DOES THIS WORK IN JAPAN PAIGE
[3:50:45] <$Agami23> paige jism
[3:50:48] <$cherpii> Pat how are your tastebuds wired???
[3:50:48] <+koboldconsortium> My power went out for a couple minutes, and I come back to yelling about pineapples and lemons.
[3:50:48] <+MoralCompassGaming> Sour does not equal Acidic Pat
[3:50:48] <mobiusnightshade> Paigeism < Shadalooism
[3:50:53] <%DedlokPM> "Pineapple is naturally sour. Depending on the variety, when it ripes, it will become sweeter as the fruit will contain more sugar. Sour means it is not ripe enough. Pineapple that's gone bad will taste bland, very watery, and a bit bitter." @PeachSaliva
[3:50:54] <+Punchasaur> my doggo sleep
[3:50:55] <%GraceTBM> probably
[3:50:55] <RubberFistFight> @PeachSaliva Pineapple is considered to be tart. Tart is a subset of sour. You couldn't be more wrong if you tried. They ARE also sweet, but complementarily to its tartness. Also the digestion thing is due to the enzyme it has called Bromelain. If you've ever eaten too much fresh pineapple and your mouth has hurt, it's because the bromelain has macerated it.
[3:50:55] <vladhelsin> idk I kind of agree with her with most of them
[3:50:56] <%AbysmalWulf> They're not that sour. But I wish they were more so.
[3:50:56] <+lethallylactic> monkaS
[3:50:57] <ShichiNoBushi> Tart < Sour
[3:50:57] <%THATGUY_789> yes
[3:50:59] <%DandyMackeroos> The Paigemaster someone said
[3:51:01] <%ElenaManetta> Your taste preferences can also be determined by your blood type
[3:51:03] <%THATGUY_789> that can happen
[3:51:03] <+SwdVengeance> Avengers 28: Civil War Duex - The Foodening
[3:51:04] <%Jekado> but the acidity is why pineapple can super tenderize meat
[3:51:04] <worldbrand> your gut fauna change the way you perceive taste so it's probably irrelevant by now
[3:51:04] <Mister_McDerp> different people taste things differently
[3:51:06] <%Niney_Who> Paige Miracle Berried herself permanently @PeachSaliva
[3:51:07] <yodajr99> I desire the sour
[3:51:10] <%SvenHolgersson> IT WAS ME!
[3:51:10] <%Niney_Who> UH HUH
[3:51:14] <cureneckbeard> How is Paige going to watch Deep Space 9 if she doesn't believe in Space? nyannHmm
[3:51:15] <%SvenHolgersson> YAH HUH
[3:51:17] <%THATGUY_789> no
[3:51:17] <yodajr99> something fierce
[3:51:21] <mobiusnightshade> Pineapple literally tries to digest you.
[3:51:22] <RubberFistFight> @Jekado nope, it's because of the bromelain in it.
[3:51:22] <Srthunda> VAMPIRE KILL
[3:51:22] <%FirearmsInstructor> Yeah blood type and diet is a real thing.
[3:51:23] <Monkeyweed21> PAIGE HOW DOES THIS WORK IN JAPAN
[3:51:27] <+Flambage> @peachsaliva "Let me tell you about pineapples as I eat this poison and glass!" says Paige
[3:51:27] <JonKhan> Unable to perceive the sour thus she truly tastes the lemon/pineapple
[3:51:28] <+Xanezz> shes filled with mustard
[3:51:31] <%FirearmsInstructor> @mobiusnightshade It's the bromelain ;)
[3:51:33] <%maskofmichael> Pat's Foot
[3:51:35] <%Roasted_Pheasant> Is marrow just the blood of a skeleton?
[3:51:36] <+MoralCompassGaming> Oops, all out of Blood!

[3:51:44] <%FirearmsInstructor> What's that smell???????
[3:51:44] <%THATGUY_789> @firearmsinstructor no that's a lie
[3:51:46] <$Sphincter_Spelunker> Just save yourself trouble and buy citric acid
[3:51:48] <johnnybelmont_95> Fear the old lemon...
[3:51:49] <%D3rrtyD4n> LOL
[3:51:50] <RubberFistFight> @Jekado bromelain is an enzyme, and they extract it, dry it out and make powdered meat tenderiser out of it.
[3:51:50] <+doc_ock_rokc> @PeachSaliva Have you tried Miracle berrys? they change the chemestry of your toung for a short while making everything taste different.
[3:51:59] <Emperor_Machinus> Only calcium courses through Paige's veins
