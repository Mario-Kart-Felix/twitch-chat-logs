[0:03:06] <SGrim> @QueequegTheater you still were done a disservice by not being given access to new advisors when you switch degree focus. Some of it may be your fault, but the system should still take an active role in transferring degree candidates to prevent drop outs. Not saying your going to drop/fail out, just as an educator this irks me. rooREE

But more seriously, I just want to let you know that you're cool. I've mentioned before I use you guys as a substitute for social interaction, and that comes with the nonsensical worry that if we knew each other we might not be friends. But honestly, that doesn't matter and this donation is reaching critical cringe mass as it is. Just keep being the trash goblin we all adore

How is the weather in the uninhabited planet you found yourself secluded after your Mustard Mustang ran out of mustard gas? Drinking a Sakura Crystal Pepsi. Yum! Can’t stay for long cause I work early tomorrow. I don’t want to miss the possible Master Peach Theater, but maybe another time. Have fun and during your stay, be huge but not huge enough that if you trip and fall it ends up looking like a Megazord falling into buildings.
