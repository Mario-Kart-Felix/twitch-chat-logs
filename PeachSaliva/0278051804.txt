[0:15:24] <fattness132> Has paige never played portal before? oh this should be good.
[0:15:26] <GurrenPrime> thats it narbacular
[0:15:27] <+AncelDeLambert> Portal is just one of those games man. It'll teach you things about yourself
[0:15:27] <PlumpPotatoRump> pats wrong, btw.
[0:15:27] <Limes528> Portal is one of the best games ever made imo
[0:15:28] <MadTimeWizard> @PeachSaliva I went to the school where the game was made, Digipen, it was kinda shit :)
[0:15:28] <+FrostMass22> I just got here and it's been the worst it's ever been
[0:15:28] <$WorldSoup5> rip
[0:15:29] <SGrim> @PeachSaliva just to let you know, not all redheads have translucent eyebrows, just the majority, and they are indicators that you are more susceptible to lymph-node transfer of melanoma. Source, my cousin is currently going through having hers treated.
[0:15:30] <Firesparks> portal is older game
[0:15:30] <$dalmek> there's a bunch of stuff that I don't know because I was a big baby when I played it
[0:15:31] <tacostarvedbeast> being an adult is hard
[0:15:32] <marvel877> so was portal 2's gel stuff.
[0:15:32] <Mr_LupLup> @Wistelligence Psssssst, now might be the time to do the thing where I admit I'm a big fan
[0:15:33] <+wingblade7> you are filled with DETERMINATION
[0:15:33] <+intwilighteyes> oh God Paige is playing portal
[0:15:34] <TerraBranfordStrife> Portal ruins relationships

[0:23:46] <$KaiserRolled> Bioshock 1 is fucking great
[0:23:46] <+LogothX> Bioshock took place at night.
[0:23:47] <%furiousfurioso> PogChamp
[0:23:49] <TheIronBrass> Infinite is trash
[0:23:49] <Croetec> 2 is the patrician choice
[0:23:49] <%CerberusDriver> dont say infinite
[0:23:50] <Bouldus> 2 is fine
[0:23:50] <TheAkex> try subnautica, great underwater game
[0:23:51] <green_tall_trees> pat is the get a load of that dog guy but Elmo instead of doggo
[0:23:51] <+AncelDeLambert> That's because Bioshock is pure class
[0:23:52] <Tha_Mik> nice
[0:23:53] <%RaikenTB> 2 is the best one.
[0:23:54] <fattness132> I think 2 is ok, but its kind of hard to follow up 1
[0:23:54] <$GohanEgret> play infinite Kappa
[0:23:56] <%RonDewing> 2 is good
[0:23:56] <%Freelance7> Infinite is eh
[0:23:56] <+Tentacruelty_> Infinite's a trash fire
[0:23:56] <%guessingtwo> i liked 2
[0:23:57] <%commanderclaw> @PeachSaliva You should play Prey!
[0:23:57] <+ScrubingtonTheThird> What else is she supposed to answers
[0:23:57] <BourneWarrior> 2 is fine
[0:23:58] <jinkipng> i loved two a lot more
[0:23:58] <Mr_LupLup> Paige X Soma
[0:23:59] <Mr_Strut> I actually prefer 2.
[0:23:59] <SkinnyRite> PogChamp mfw Pat says 2 is great
[0:23:59] <Sapphire_Breeze> infinite is trash
[0:23:59] <rjj25> 2 was better
[0:23:59] <+krawtch> Rocking the hat & handlebars today? trukM
[0:24:00] <ProtoShawk> I feel like 2 gets shit on too much
[0:24:00] <$low_ver_zealous> Just tuned in and Anne of green gables is on main
[0:24:00] <prime_name> 2 Is the best to me.
[0:24:00] <mrjohncarlton> 2 is alright but has flaws
[0:24:02] <LiquidMathew> Infinite the smart game for smart gamers
[0:24:02] <lankaster88> 2 is fun
[0:24:02] <generalve> @PeachSaliva if you liked bioshock thneplay pREY
[0:24:02] <+micalica> Infinite is fun :(
[0:24:02] <Prevot> infinite DansGame
[0:24:03] <+Chimeraelite> 2 is a different feel. Decent but not mind blowing like the first
[0:24:03] <%RonDewing> infinate is good too
[0:24:03] <+TaliTenenbaum> @mtgtin definitely, most of OC is fine tho
[0:24:03] <kamen_advent> Infinite is an overrated mess
[0:24:03] <DesertPenguin09> I'm finishing the newest Detroit episode. Insane
[0:24:04] <uncleholly> but what about Infinite 2?
[0:24:04] <+Crimson_helm> fine
[0:24:05] <%guessingtwo> infinite bad
[0:24:06] <SkinnyRite> isn't*
[0:24:06] <+AncelDeLambert> it's super generic, is what it is
[0:24:06] <yautja_butts> Jaws Unleashed is the best water based game
[0:24:06] <mercado94> it was average
[0:24:07] <subjectg> Infinite is meh
[0:24:07] <+McSoliace> Read while doing squats Paige!
[0:24:07] <RogueDragonHunter> 50 pounds of pence
[0:24:09] <+Chimeraelite> yep
[0:24:09] <%Hybrid_Niji> 2 > 1 > i
[0:24:09] <generalve> YES
[0:24:10] <Mr_LupLup> Paige needs to play Soma
[0:24:10] <SkinnyRite> MUDDLED????
[0:24:11] <SwindlerOfProgress> Infinite is decent.
[0:24:11] <prettypatties97> Muddled is fitting
[0:24:12] <smargh1015> less than fine
[0:24:12] <+AmaniIsYourBoss> Infinite's alright I guess. Maybe.
[0:24:12] <AllYouCanYeet> Bio 1>Infinite>bio 2
[0:24:12] <$KaiserRolled> Agreed
[0:24:13] <+TheGershon> It was really not fine imo
[0:24:13] <$NaotoKozuki> its fine
[0:24:13] <Gerik1233> infinite the best
[0:24:13] <LiquidMathew> wait a minute that card
[0:24:13] <SC07TK> 1 > Infinite > 2
[0:24:14] <mtgtin> That's perfect
[0:24:14] <grayjammer> 2's better than people give it credit for. 2 basically did Infinite's story except Not Terrible
[0:24:14] <+MellowYellowFellow> yeah thats true
[0:24:15] <MadTimeWizard> i wouldve said "shit" buuuuuut
[0:24:15] <hypoid77> inifinite TRASH
[0:24:16] <+LogothX> At least the porn was good.
[0:24:16] <Shimmying_skeleton> Infinite is good fight ME
[0:24:16] <$TheWeenieZucchini> Every Bioshock after 1 is very okay
[0:24:16] <Fujiwara_92> M U D D L E D
[0:24:17] <+JoeStillLife> Infinite was good
[0:24:17] <SpookyBeef7> Infinite is fine but gets weird towards the end.
[0:24:17] <Laironx3> sandbag Infinite
[0:24:17] <TheIronBrass> 2 had my favorite combat
[0:24:18] <Mittensbro> infinite is one of the most controversial games i've heard people have opinions on
[0:24:19] <%guessingtwo> kill the one black person to end racism
[0:24:19] <Croetec> 1 is overrated especially near the end
[0:24:19] <$Piemono> It went through a lot of redos
[0:24:20] <Prism_Wing> I'm the only person on earth who loves Bioshock Infinite.
[0:24:21] <+Comrade_Vladof> Infinite was mediocre and forgettable
[0:24:21] <+Sonik2324> yea it was forgettable
[0:24:21] <Hidashi13> System Shock 1 was the best
[0:24:23] <Mr_LupLup> INfinite sucks
[0:24:23] <$ImasukyLomae> Some is perfect
[0:24:24] <RipSlamsteak> wait a minute that card
[0:24:24] <uncleholly> there was some...muddy aspects of that plot i think
[0:24:25] <+Bupkis7> infinite is good
[0:24:25] <+AncelDeLambert> remember when Infinite came out and everyone called it genius?
[0:24:25] <+drewg91> I liked Infinite. It was fun
[0:24:26] <+Dingus_Tickler> Yeah, atleast the SFM Elizabeth is great
[0:24:26] <yautja_butts> literally the only good thing out of Infinite was the Source Filmmaker porn
[0:24:26] <ShadowZiggy> There were a lot of things cut
[0:24:27] <+Buytoast> they kept redoing it yeah
[0:24:28] <$MonsterEnvy> System Shock is good
[0:24:29] <SC07TK> Portal though... ;)
[0:24:29] <%LifesNeverHumDrum> ppl can do whatever, i just wish oue neighbors didn't toke directly into our ventilation system lol
[0:24:29] <codussalpha> Prey 2017 was a better Bioshock game than Bioshock Infinite
[0:24:29] <SkinnyRite> @LogothX Real talk
[0:24:29] <%AnAsianToaster> infinite is a good game fight me
[0:24:31] <mrjohncarlton> What is with games with "Infinite" in the title and crushing disappointment?
[0:24:31] <Mr_LupLup> Infinite sucks
[0:24:31] <%Plutt_bug> Bioshock is dead just like God
[0:24:32] <Rigenstein> I loved Infinite
[0:24:32] <uncleholly> ...
[0:24:33] <BigRooster83> The world is changing...
[0:24:33] <+Dingus_Tickler> Safe for Me Elizabeth models
[0:24:34] <StandInMan> Portal when?
[0:24:34] <tacostarvedbeast> multiple restarts, always a good start
[0:24:35] <+ScrubingtonTheThird> They didnt really know what Infinite meant for story purposes
[0:24:36] <kamen_advent> There's a great Crowbcat video on Bioshock Infinite
[0:24:37] <Semiconductive> doesnt matter, elizabeth was a babe
[0:24:37] <PessimisticOptimism> Infinite was fun
[0:24:38] <uncleholly> is that actually lana del ray though
[0:24:40] <+JoeStillLife> Bioshock would be cool
[0:24:43] <generalve> ACE ATTOREY
[0:24:43] <SkinnyRite> So, Portal?
[0:24:43] <@Moobot> We're accepting fanfiction submissions, if you think you have a good one message a mod today!
[0:24:46] <Mr_LupLup> If you like Infinite you have shit taste
[0:24:47] <marvel877> Infinite was better the first time when it was MGS2...
[0:24:48] <$MonsterEnvy> Prey was systemshock not Bioshock
[0:24:49] <SpookyBeef7> Also because the PC version of Bioshock is FUCKED
[0:24:49] <CactusChef3> infinite was a pretty good game it was just garbage compared to expectations
[0:24:51] <lankaster88> Infinite is a goid game just not a great Bioshock sequel
[0:24:52] <KaiserMario> infinite was made by former Bioshock developers
[0:24:52] <Prevot> you have a short game right next to you
[0:24:52] <ELuscious> 5? more like 2
[0:24:54] <sponsoredviewer910> bioshock is basically a giant sewers level, think about it

[0:51:57] <$KaiserRolled> It looks like trash
[0:51:58] <+NiktenKing> DARLINGTON IN THE FRANXX
[0:51:58] <captainthunderwolf> Darling's more about ass than it is about being good
[0:51:59] <+MarshallLee67> darling in the franxx is boring as fuuuuck
[0:51:59] <DedlokPM> Darling in the Franxx is meh
[0:51:59] <Futurecity10> Darling in the franxx is fucking trash

[0:52:02] <EVA_Unit02> It's bad
[0:52:03] <chickendisasterx> Darling and the BAD
[0:52:04] <subjectg> Darling was good in the middle then Trigger had to meme hard
[0:52:05] <MyNameIsRasus> Preggo cucks
[0:52:06] <+YZYMANDIAS> It'd be nice if we could watch some Portal gameplay
[0:52:06] <Polarix64> Somebody's audio must be fucked because yeah it's great on my end and most other people in chat's end
[0:52:07] <%deadpalvgz> yep.
[0:52:07] <hazardkujacker> Darling in the Franxx is just FLCL
[0:52:07] <AlfredoCavatelli> tiddy mecha is shit
[0:52:07] <%KendallLitDinner> sounds like chat disagrees
[0:52:07] <$TheWeenieZucchini> Its very okay
[0:52:09] <urmomgaylooool> modern anime LUL
[0:52:09] <+cvp5127> its a trash fire. its great
[0:52:10] <Gregorhasjoined> Endless TRASH:D
[0:52:10] <Fujiwara_92> DARLINGTON IN THE FRANXXX
[0:52:10] <$MonsterEnvy> Darling in the Franxx is good
[0:52:10] <+ScrubingtonTheThird> Its just another average show, dont worry about it
[0:52:11] <TheIronBrass> It's fine but got worse
[0:52:12] <iamnotjex> fuck that i love the mechas
[0:52:14] <+NiktenKing> It closes bad
[0:52:16] <gyrogogozeppeli> TRASH
[0:52:20] <%deadpalvgz> Fuck darling in the franxx is fucking trash.
[0:52:20] <$MonsterEnvy> I like it a lot
[0:52:20] <DedlokPM> It has its good moments, but the good moments are way out numbered by bad
[0:52:21] <Gregorhasjoined> endless trash!
[0:52:21] <the_phantom_theif> The first half was mediocre. NotLikeThis
[0:52:24] <+jediwatchman11> it's baddddddd
[0:52:25] <Gary_Plays_Games> darling in the franxx is great, but it definitely steered away from being a mecha for a while
[0:52:25] <GUNxSPECTRE> Studio Trigger is TRASH now, like TellTale
[0:52:26] <+Chimeraelite> It is STUPID KIDS the show that's kinda cute sometimes
[0:52:26] <$gozzojt27> its not great...
[0:52:27] <+JenovasPuppet> Man that alien shit was and continues to be awful.
[0:52:27] <+NiktenKing> Guilty Crown 2.0?
[0:52:28] <twistedj3ster> sounds like one piece
[0:52:28] <Heartlander> No it's great though.

[0:52:30] <blackbaron98> its a bunch of filler
[0:52:31] <+TheShal> I'm loving it though
[0:52:32] <%CerberusDriver> Darling in the Franxx is just: I want to fuck the pink haired thing. Thats all i get from it
[0:52:33] <Mittensbro> the problem is that the most recent episode is excellent but it requires three episodes preceding it that suck
[0:52:34] <+jediwatchman11> also it's just about HEY KIDS GET MARRIED PLEASE
[0:52:34] <+Finaldragoon> fuck that video
[0:52:35] <YaiGameworks> I have liked Darling personally.
[0:52:35] <+guyalex> came for the mechs, stayed for the world building, left after like 8 episodes when it was obviously going nowhere
[0:52:36] <SpaceCaptainCrone> Darling in the Franxx doesn't know what it wants to be.
[0:52:39] <$TheWeenieZucchini> It started badly, then got really good, then got REALLY bad
[0:52:40] <%RonDewing> so it like gurren lagaan
[0:52:40] <$SvenHolgersson> Trigger anime usually end badly
[0:52:42] <+Dasbubba> The show opinion I’ve been seeing seems to go from this is bad, this is great, this is bad.
[0:52:42] <captainthunderwolf> Darling In the Franxx Writers: "ThE quEEn dINOsaur is a BLUe loLi! ! !"

[0:53:34] <$MonsterEnvy> I actully like Darling in the Franxx
[0:53:36] <Gehtingsberg> CBD oil?
[0:53:36] <+Dasbubba> The funniest is the protagonist unable to drive a real mech has to use a training mech that has a fake ass as the steering wheel. It’s so strange.
[0:53:39] <MyNameIsRasus> Show her the butt driving Pat

[0:55:09] <yautja_butts> I used to devour the McDonalds Tendies but I've moved onto Nuggies. Nuggies > Tendies
[0:55:10] <subjectg> They’re average, but 20 nuggets for $5 is a good deal
[0:55:10] <+DeathmanJones> I turned 20 on the 20th earlier this year
[0:55:12] <Overloard> does she hate mcnuggies because of that whole proceessed meat thing?
[0:55:12] <captainthunderwolf> @Heartlander But the relationships are just about selling waifus and all the commentary it makes is extremely shallow for anyone with experience in the matter
[0:55:12] <SiegeJay> PAT IS WRONG
[0:55:13] <ECRead> Darling in the Franxx is the bastard child of Gurren Lagann and Kiznaver but takes the best points of each and doesn't do them well and ends up just being fine

[0:57:15] <Hidashi13> my fastfood weakness is either A&W Canada or Wendy's Baconators
[0:57:18] <$GohanEgret> oh boy!
[0:57:18] <$SvenHolgersson> Streets are for whores
[0:57:21] <+YZYMANDIAS> deadass gonna be an hour of talking
[0:57:22] <EVA_Unit02> @Keith_The_Triangle They never did rentals
[0:57:22] <%LifesNeverHumDrum> streets are for the plebians
[0:57:24] <+TheGershon> I plan to go make food when you actually start the game
[0:57:24] <Snaketsu> can we shoot a portal to when the game starts
[0:57:25] <prettypatties97> Is it by the bank or the grocery store? No? Then fuck, just take me there
[0:57:26] <+Saggitori> @operator_san canada is a weird place. could happen there
[0:57:26] <%Tooniearcade> DUMBO VIDEO?
[0:57:27] <Brutal_Defeat> oh good i still made it for the podcast

[0:57:29] <operator_san> @Keith_The_Triangle circuit city is not a local store nor do they rent games or ever did lol
[0:57:33] <%GeneralSCPatton> Streets ARE for losers, but my parents don't get it.
[0:57:35] <twistedj3ster> Just take a squat
[0:57:39] <+Dasbubba> @hidashi13 A&W root beer is solid.
[0:57:39] <captainthunderwolf> @Polarix64 It's really just there as a conveyance mechanism for an okay-ish tasting barbecue sauce with a weird aftertaste. It's not really food but it tastes fine if eaten fresh and also you only eat one so the aftertaste doesn't set in.
[0:57:39] <prettypatties97> I don't got time to memorize street names
[0:57:40] <gyrogogozeppeli> LUL

[1:35:30] <elementofloyalty> shoot the burn mark
[1:35:32] <gotacoolname> When you're lost in the darkness, look for the light. Believe in the Fireflies.
[1:35:32] <+SchlomoGoldbergsteinowitz> Puzzles are the scariest monsters
[1:35:34] <bryanmildew> the only monster in this game is MAN
[1:35:35] <Man_F_Artwish> octo expansion is better than portal 2 fight me
[1:35:35] <%jalford31> @olliedelosa she has to train first
[1:35:41] <%breakfastmagepowers> It would've gone so much more poorly if she used a mouse since they are poo poo

[1:36:15] <A123yourdead> TheIlluminati
[1:36:16] <DeathByPoke7> for anyone that enjoies portal i would reccomend antichamber. its a similar fps puzzle game with an awsome aesthetic.
[1:36:20] <elementofloyalty> Go now
[1:36:25] <ObsidianDragon86> PAT! SHHHHHHHH!
[1:36:27] <Cheapheatmo> chet faliszek is a genius
[1:36:31] <sangi53> why would the game ask you pinpoint precision shooting when it's a puzzle game
[1:36:31] <Tisaric> Antichamber is a complete mindfuck
[1:36:32] <+jediwatchman11> I loved portal but antechamber made me hate life itself

[1:36:50] <@Calek> I played and beat Anitchamber in one sitting and it screwed me up mentally for an entire day

[2:15:47] <CandideCamera> Paige has basically not completed a single level Kappa
[2:15:48] <Mr_Strut> If anything, Pat should be sabotaging her.
[2:15:48] <Estuko> As said by the super best friends all at once to a challenge, "HOW DARE YOU CALL US SMART"
[2:15:50] <$joylent_blue> BE NICE TO THE PAT

[2:15:50] <tacostarvedbeast> great coaching pat, this is bloodborn all over again

[2:15:53] <ashenonec> LUL
[2:15:53] <%Keyd00d> paige is so dumb, the only way she gets anything is RIDIN' ON PAT'S COATTAILS
[2:15:53] <TheNeedlesD> For the most part, you get the harder ones knocked out quite easily Paige, but the easier ones you tend to get stuck on.
[2:15:55] <+Bupkis7> More like riding of Pat's DICK

[2:16:01] <SwindlerOfProgress> Paige, you're doing fine by yourself. Pat's "help" has been negligible or too late to matter.
[2:16:01] <mercado94> we dont need pat helping you for us to tell you that
[2:16:03] <$GohanEgret> IF SHE BREATHE SHE A PAT
[2:16:03] <+LuckyChocobo> I can't wait for "PAT HEEEELP" in the later test chambers

[2:16:08] <hypoid77> heh paige is so dumb she can only breathe because pat does it for her
[2:16:12] <YO_WHADUP> it's pats' controller, she couldn't even move without him!
[2:16:12] <$TheWeenieZucchini> Im sensing negativity
[2:16:13] <eldrich_horror> hasnt pat helped her with every game she streamed?
[2:16:13] <%urdumb4twitching> never a good idea to tell a group of people things that make you upset lol
[2:16:15] <+SomeSortOfMagic> well thats dark
[2:16:16] <+Dingus_Tickler> Those coat tails are just his balls dragging behind

[2:16:24] <$Agami23> pat, tell her to put a portal above and below her.

[2:16:29] <%RadicalWeegee> PAT stop being so caring, loving and Helpful CHAT HATES IT!

[2:16:54] <Heartlander> Portal go up. Glados go down.
[2:17:00] <+ConstipatedLlama> maybe chat should shut up and not complain whenever pat says any tiny thing
[2:17:03] <Estuko> @pleasenameyourcharacter can you imagine, just the ability to transfer the need to use the restroom from one person to another

[2:53:24] <Dragon_Batman> the frames
[2:53:25] <Hydrapissed> mega helps
[2:53:26] <Worldbrand> it's a super metroid thing
[2:53:26] <Everpresent_Overseer> I figured it out! you... use... Portals!
[2:53:26] <+Grayhammatter> they saved them
[2:53:27] <%NWR_James> @urdumb4twitching but it's not creating chaos by making her look for every camera there is
[2:53:27] <Fujiwara_92> SAVE THE FRAMS
[2:53:28] <Gary_Plays_Games> save the frames, kill the animals.
[2:53:28] <$Piemono> its a SDGQ thing
[2:53:28] <SchroedingersFerret> Super Metroid
[2:53:28] <+SoarFlyer> Pat ruined Portal
[2:53:30] <AlchemiBeast> its a reference to the super metroid speedrun
[2:53:31] <+ConstipatedLlama> how does pat not know about that
[2:53:32] <SwindlerOfProgress> It's a Metroid speedrun meme.
[2:53:32] <NemokillerV> speedrunning joke
[2:53:33] <+Camail> these guys murder all the frames
[2:53:33] <+TheGershon> framerate
[2:53:33] <%GeneralSCPatton> It's a Super Metroid AGDQ reference
[2:53:34] <Hydrapissed> Frames
[2:53:34] <Bionicghost> don't forget, we are here forever
[2:53:37] <+cereal_box_conspiracy> the running of the speds is on the twitter tv
[2:53:40] <imbatman37> its a GDQ meme

[2:53:49] <elementofloyalty> floor wall
[2:53:49] <ProtoShawk> The challenge version of this room sucks
[2:53:51] <+Grayhammatter> fell through ganon's ass and now he's dead LUL
[2:53:52] <+paladinstarbuster> LUL
[2:53:52] <+pleasenameyourcharacter> i guess the only way to "not help" is if Pat left the room, but then we'd likely see Paige die at some point
[2:53:52] <%GarbageNirvana> Wasn't there a very specific sequence of button inputs in Super Mario World that glitched you to the credits or something
[2:53:53] <DapperHatwell> Fell through ganon's ass
[2:53:53] <+ConstipatedLlama> I figured pat of all people would know it
[2:53:54] <vivecdidnothingwrong> Link to Ganon's ass?

[2:53:58] <jiin6> never save the animals
[2:54:08] <+JenovasPuppet> Reading Paige's donations is helping.
[2:54:08] <elementofloyalty> geting warmer
[2:54:09] <+NMEDom> save frames for better time or save animals that might be a horrible virus that the metroids were built specifically to destroy @PeachSaliva
[2:54:10] <Fujiwara_92> don't forget we are here forever
[2:54:11] <+PipIV> where do you think you? this is where speed goes to die

[2:54:19] <Junkles> ah the Ganon's ass warp
[2:54:22] <gyrogogozeppeli> what are you doing
[2:54:24] <+TheGershon> In Super Metroid you can save animals which isn't required and people donate to chose whether they'll do it or not
[2:54:26] <elementofloyalty> three shotrs
[2:54:28] <+PipIV> *think you are
[2:54:28] <+SWindleFeD> had the right idea

[2:54:38] <+KevinsLunchbox> she's fixated on the fucking camera and it's awful
[2:54:38] <%Yomandude> I don't think it's helping to say that the camera is an easter egg with no relevance
[2:54:38] <DapperHatwell> omg she's backtracking
[2:54:40] <OkamiDude15> @GarbageNirvana rewriting the ram to play a game of snake and see the credits in like a minute
[2:54:43] <AlchemiBeast> this is where controller is a real hindrance
[2:54:44] <Covil91> Oh god, she's fixating on the camera isn't she?
[2:54:46] <+JenovasPuppet> YASS STREAM!
[2:54:49] <elementofloyalty> Pat streams in the toilet bowl
