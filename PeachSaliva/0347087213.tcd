[0:18:27] <+pleasenameyourcharacter> which is more of a fighting game, smash, or detroit?
[0:18:30] <Worldbrand> audiences like it when they feel smart
[0:18:30] <%SuichiTanaka> It's like Power Rangers. They need to move extra for it to read to the audience.
[0:18:33] <%ssjklyco> That movie is almost 20 years old now.

[0:19:01] <+HypotheticalWalrus> I imagine the director tells them to do it so people who dont play games knows what they are doing
[0:19:02] <Endocrom> It's to show the elderly people that watch Law and Order what they think is the videogames

[0:21:15] <Liquid_Dio> VoteNay VoteNay VoteNay
[0:21:15] <%Garthunox> 2
[0:21:15] <+UncannyMatt> Homestuck is dead anyway
[0:21:15] <+CarlosEoM> OH NO
[0:21:15] <+DeadpanSoupcan> only read the midnight crew
[0:21:15] <zamzoph> PROBLEM SLEUTH
[0:21:15] <thelovingfool> y e s
[0:21:15] <+Hilleltaco> I think people are overly negative towards Homestuck. It's kinda neat
[0:21:15] <+Superkbrown95> can you read more sonic high school?
[0:21:15] <+TeachMe549> Paige, what's your hot take on Joker being added?
[0:21:17] <%mistymntns> sipsipHellmo
[0:21:17] <$Dotta5> borf
[0:21:18] <%legendfather_of_giants> THE HOMESTUCK ONE HASNT
[0:21:19] <+Bouerd> Paige BECAME the fanbase
[0:21:20] <quy33> i will subsribe then un sub
[0:21:22] <+zamatermort> Did you unlock everyone?
[0:21:22] <ShadeTheNovice> Whats wrong with Homestuck?
[0:21:23] <%Garthunox> NOOO
[0:21:24] <GarbageQueenEllie> Just don't coat yourself in grey goo
[0:21:26] <doofmaster> Homestuck had its moments but ended on a whimper
[0:21:27] <ryderbootz> i dont know what it is so YES do it
[0:21:29] <$ooblagis> No, Homestuck is just BAD for like thousands of pages
[0:21:29] <Bouldus> NO
[0:21:32] <+HiroTSK5> @PeachSaliva THe Homestuck fans jumped ship to Undertale
[0:21:32] <%The48thCrow> As a homestuck fan, it's not even really worth reading the whole way through
[0:21:32] <+filledusoleil> homestuck has the most toxic community ever
[0:21:34] <carlosmanriquez> @PeachSaliva hey pat, are reading jojo or just doing that weird shiet you do when you just read the wikipidea? 'cuz it's been on fire for a part and a half
[0:21:35] <Bailey__gaming> @peachsaliva any interest in Ashen? it looks kinda soulsys
[0:21:36] <Hydrapissed> JOTORO echo fighter
[0:21:37] <+HayabusaZeroZ> Don't worry, I didn't play through Undertale until like last month
[0:21:37] <@Calek> nothing wrong with Homestuck, just the fanbase is rabid
[0:21:38] <@SSaryn> Joker will be my main and I think Solidus shares this opinion.
[0:21:39] <Worldbrand> NO, the problem is the homestucks who HAVEN'T left
[0:21:39] <@commanderclaw> We never saw it coming
[0:21:39] <%salty_syd913> you never saw it coming
[0:21:40] <+comfyman12> PAT TALK ABOUT HOW SHIT V'S THEME IS
[0:21:42] <Bouldus> well done chat, saved it
[0:21:42] <jobbedbone> have you seen objectale where people draw the characters as everyday objects?
[0:21:46] <devanmuse> Homestuck is good, y'all just can't separate the fans from the thing they're fans of
[0:21:46] <+d00msdaydan> @PeachSaliva do problem sleuth instead, it comes before homestuck and is way more coherent
[0:21:49] <vexicbayn> is the homestuck fandumb even a thing anymore?
[0:21:50] <DonatelloJose> we all lost our collective shit. We truly did not see it coming.
[0:21:52] <joehawks122> homestuck is farrrr too much lore at this point. its not worthit
[0:21:55] <+badchoice5> Hey Pat, thank you/fuck you for introducing me to Monster Hunter World, I'm not getting anything done now
[0:21:57] <+filledusoleil> its more legit than cloud tbh
[0:21:57] <%Garthunox> No it's just PQ2
[0:21:57] <reiju_22> stream persona PogChamp
[0:21:58] <hntronium> PAT BESTFRIENDS
[0:22:02] <%AncelDeLambert> he's not gonna be in smash
[0:22:03] <hassanico> DOOMGUY FOR SMASH
[0:22:04] <%Aitch971> When's Line Kill Spirits?
[0:22:04] <%Zaver88> Kiryu counts since Yakuza is on the Wii U
[0:22:05] <%Wallabri> i thought it was a joke edit when my friend showed me the reveal clip
[0:22:06] <alrobot2014> @PeachSaliva is it more tangential than Cloud?
[0:22:06] <+JoeStillLife> Not gonna happen
[0:22:07] <%Shadowpint> I honestly really want Sans for Smash
[0:22:07] <ccrida> @PeachSaliva what if neither get in?
[0:22:07] <+Comrade_Vladof> If Joker can get in, literally anyone that has ever touched a Nintendo console ever can get it
[0:22:08] <arcaderabbit48> I would prefer Papyrus, or Metaton
[0:22:08] <@Calek> Cloud was in Kingdom Hearts on the GBA so whatever they got to work with I guess
[0:22:08] <hntronium> PAIGE PEACHSALIVA
[0:22:08] <%Garthunox> not p3q2
[0:22:08] <ECRead> You are going to lose
[0:22:09] <SentientHoodie> No Paige. It will be Travish Touchdown
[0:22:09] <+DopeyDragon> Persona 5 coming to switch soon I suspect
[0:22:09] <ShadeTheNovice> Sans Undertale in Smash PogChamp
[0:22:10] <%Djinnazz> NOPE
[0:22:11] <TheInkshow> @PeachSaliva All of them NEED TO BE JAPANESE
[0:22:11] <%NWR_James> "Mr. Undertale is my fathers name"
[0:22:11] <+JoeStillLife> Neither
[0:22:11] <KayThree> SAMS UNDRATABLE
[0:22:11] <AtlasMcCoy> I give paige a 0% chance of winning
[0:22:12] <%AncelDeLambert> not gonna happen
[0:22:12] <+blastazoid26> It will be subzero
[0:22:12] <%heckyell> you know that it doesn't matter if they're nintendo or not, right?
[0:22:12] <+LogothX> Is "Undertale" his last name
[0:22:13] <+patriotrenegade> @PeachSaliva You're such Undertale trash, Paige
[0:22:14] <DesuDesuDokiDoki> DOOM
[0:22:15] <+UncannyMatt> What about Sans Deltarune?
[0:22:16] <pectusumbra> Yeah, persona q2 man. And Honestly I think it's gonna be Undyne
[0:22:16] <%ssjklyco> Next character will be Monster Hunter.
[0:22:17] <hassanico> Bully people who like Undertale
[0:22:18] <ShadeTheNovice> Neither really
[0:22:18] <%AncelDeLambert> neither is gonna be in
[0:22:18] <ckangaroo15k> Sans is totally possible.
[0:22:19] <mercado94> @PeachSaliva You are going to lose so hard
[0:22:19] <EVA_Unit02> It will be Goku
[0:22:20] <TheInkshow> Ryu, cloud all japanese
[0:22:20] <DonatelloJose> @PeachSaliva Super eyepatchwolf mentioned on stream that he thinks Sans will be DLC.
[0:22:21] <Laironx3> No Bloodborne 2 will be in Smash
[0:22:22] <+TDotGoat> Mr. Doom
[0:22:23] <TranquilTurnip> Crash, Banjo, Kiryu, and Sans
[0:22:24] <VanLynx> it can't be Sans since we expect it more than Joker
[0:22:25] <%Rhinoprotoss> SANS IN SMASH WOULD JUST BE A HUGE SPOILER
[0:22:25] <+zamatermort> You will both lose
[0:22:25] <shurtal> What if PAPYRUS gets in instead of Sans?
[0:22:26] <Dragonfang1337> Pat has a slightly higher chance
[0:22:26] <+UnderpaidBob> I think they'll get Dante
[0:22:27] <$BioStormX> Chat's bet is Goku
[0:22:27] <+filledusoleil> shit might as well get goku
[0:22:28] <ShadyIMG> I just dream of Tifa and Sparkster in it.
[0:22:28] <+HiroTSK5> Why is Pat so hung up on Doom guy
[0:22:29] <+MaiHusbando9S> pat's got this one
[0:22:29] <themagic_conch> sub-zero could actually get in
[0:22:31] <bagheadlive> neither of those will be in smash playable
[0:22:32] <+pleasenameyourcharacter> no, Doomguy is his name-o
[0:22:32] <@SSaryn> Once again, more rumors pointing to Persona 5 being on Switch with an interview from Reggie.
[0:22:34] <GarbageQueenEllie> It's gonna be Rick
[0:22:36] <KayThree> we just want geno man ;-;
[0:22:36] <+TeachMe549> Sorry, Pat, I'm totally with Paige on this
[0:22:37] <DavidSanChan> corporal Flynn taggart
[0:22:37] <IntrepidEye> Dovahkiin will probably get in first
[0:22:37] <+dansinginthestreet> COMMANDER KEEN
[0:22:37] <AMajorTom> Doom regretably more likely
[0:22:37] <+Superkbrown95> you r both wrong, Sora from Kingdom Hearts is in PogChamp
[0:22:38] <Bouldus> Doom chan Kappa
[0:22:39] <+blastazoid26> KENNY IS RIGHT, IT'L BE SUBZERO
[0:22:40] <@PlagueOfGripes> the DLC ones are "from underrepresented third parties"
[0:22:43] <EASrake> Man but what about Quote
[0:22:45] <leadenstrides> This is actually possible. What times are we living in folks.
[0:22:45] <$Dotta5> The Messenger for smash
[0:22:46] <+filledusoleil> sans before doom guy, goku also before doom guy
[0:22:48] <vexicbayn> UNDYNE WOULD BE SO MUCH BETTER THAN SANS
[0:22:49] <+patriotrenegade> SUB-ZERO FOR SMASH
[0:22:50] <+Quigsies> Dante from the hit game DMC: Devil May Cry for Smash!
[0:22:51] <blackbookalpha> 2B for Smash
[0:22:52] <$GohanEgret> G O K U
[0:22:53] <DesuDesuDokiDoki> more fire emblem!!!
[0:22:54] <Lord_of_all_Edges> You haven't done the last bet things.
[0:22:54] <%skm742> Does Commander Keen count for Pat?
[0:22:57] <+Comrade_Vladof> MONSTER HUNTER FOR SMASH
[0:22:58] <DatAsuna> If she loses she should write an undertale fanfic of her own instead
[0:22:58] <poweredscoot> Raymoo for SmAsh
[0:22:58] <+UncannyMatt> He has to read erotic Undertale fanfiction with you
[0:22:59] <Lord_of_all_Edges> Makeup video!
[0:23:01] <ShadeTheNovice> 2B for Smash tho Kreygasm
[0:23:02] <jobbedbone> SORA FOR SMASH
[0:23:03] <AMajorTom> read in an Italian accent
[0:23:04] <kumokalt> And in reality we are going to get a fortnite character
[0:23:05] <+Hilleltaco> Honestly memes aside, an Undertale character isn't that unlikely to me
[0:23:05] <Shining_Armor> What of Monika from Doki Doki Literature Club shows up and neither of your characters do. What happens then?
[0:23:08] <Bouldus> there isnt enough to make up a minute Kappa
[0:23:08] <hassanico> saber for smush
[0:23:11] <+Sovspot> None of them will be in Smash. None of the characters currently in smash are non japanese properties. There are no western properties.
[0:23:11] <blackbookalpha> 2B in six games already
[0:23:11] <Mothmanendured> Caim for Sm5sh
[0:23:13] <Bouldus> youre too busted Kappa
[0:23:14] <Prevot> Sub-Zero, Agumon, Spider-Man and Goku. I'm calling it.
[0:23:14] <$Dotta5> Dead Cells or Messenger
[0:23:14] <+masta7> It’s going to be neither
[0:23:14] <+blastazoid26> Smash 2B?
[0:23:16] <Stab_master_ars0n> PROPOSAL ON STREAM
[0:23:17] <DesuDesuDokiDoki> ohh 2B
[0:23:18] <%waltzqueen> i hope monika doesnt show up
[0:23:19] <alrobot2014> Pat for Banjo Kazooie
[0:23:20] <%Shadowpint> I kinda want Minecraft Steve to be DLC just to piss people off
[0:23:20] <+filledusoleil> honestly i am super surprised no kingdom hearts yet
[0:23:21] <benjiFG> Solaire is basically guaranteed
[0:23:23] <+comfyman12> Kiryu in Smash, Majima for Tekken
[0:23:25] <@SSaryn> ~Tell me lies, tell me sweet little lies God Coward~
[0:23:26] <GarbageQueenEllie> @Shining_Armor JUST MONIKA
[0:23:27] <+badchoice5> Pat would bring a gun
[0:23:27] <%SuichiTanaka> Pat's really scrappy.
[0:23:28] <DonatelloJose> pat is scrappy.
[0:23:28] <EASrake> Rich came back from the dead
[0:23:30] <KitsuneManami> If Shantae can't get in Sans has NO CHANCE
[0:23:30] <%AncelDeLambert> Rich has that back
[0:23:30] <+JoeStillLife> Rich "Ellen Show" Evans
[0:23:31] <Bouldus> Pat has fat
[0:23:32] <%Gogogolem> Pat brought a gun
[0:23:32] <$BioStormX> Pat will pull out his gun
[0:23:32] <AMajorTom> Pat wins because of experiance
[0:23:32] <+TheMattman1313> It's gonna be 2B when they announce Nier Autotomato for Switch
[0:23:34] <Bouldus> and cheating
[0:23:36] <%Remery_> Pat will throw Pocket Sand
[0:23:36] <+UnderpaidBob> we already missed majima for negan
[0:23:37] <Laironx3> SAND IN YOUR EYES
[0:23:38] <shurtal> you cannot underestimate the power of GUN
[0:23:38] <Hydrapissed> lol
[0:23:39] <+UncannyMatt> Rich would run in close with a gun
[0:23:39] <blackbaron98> pat will stab rich
[0:23:40] <%Picabunny> god if 2B got into smash? nut instantly
[0:23:40] <%SuichiTanaka> Remember all those fights pre-school Pat got into
[0:23:41] <Socom01> rich has to survive mike daily
[0:23:42] <Gameslayer2> Pat would cheat
[0:23:42] <Laecerelius> It's gonna be Dovahkiin! Bethesda has fooled you into buying Skyrim AGAIN!
[0:23:43] <Shining_Armor> @GarbageQueenEllie A LITTLE BIT OF MONIKA IN MY LIFE
[0:23:43] <%Aitch971> cheer200 When's Line Kill Spirits?
[0:23:44] <doofmaster> If you can find Rich. He's a big star in LA now.
[0:23:44] <zagardal> rich, pat and danny devito
[0:23:46] <%AncelDeLambert> Pat Baby will screm
[0:23:48] <+FierceDeityGabriel> Mike would take a drink
[0:23:48] <poweredscoot> Dick the Birthday Boy vs Fuccboivin
[0:23:48] <mercado94> I cant believe Rich Evans appear in Ellen Show
[0:23:48] <%Typhaeon> Mikey Stokes
[0:23:50] <+FrostMass22> Rich has the power of precognition
[0:23:50] <+patriotrenegade> Man, you guys are gonna be so embarrassed when its Sub-Zero who gets announced for Smash DLC @PeachSaliva
[0:23:50] <jobbedbone> if we get solaire can you imagine the level? I want firelink shrine stage
[0:23:52] <Bouldus> Pat cant have a gun hes not allowed
[0:23:52] <grayjammer> Slow Start > Gets interesting > Hardcut to tedious bullshit > Gets Interesting > Hardcut to tedious bullshit > Seemingly Endless Cycle of Nothing Happening and Shocking Moments To Keep it "Fresh" > Disappointing ending. There. That's the entirety of Homestuck.
[0:23:53] <Logan_Jennings1> hhaha
[0:23:54] <Hydrapissed> Rich would win
[0:23:55] <reiju_22> negan in smash Kreygasm
[0:23:56] <ccrida> Rich could just laugh and Pat would be paralyzed from the laughter
[0:23:57] <+Validuntil2077> Rich has sonic-based attacks but Pat is a Stnad-user
[0:23:58] <PumaOfDarkness> Did the stream just start?
[0:23:58] <Bouldus> government said so
[0:24:01] <$GohanEgret> pat's mouse squeak after the furry woolie joke is my favorite shit of all time
[0:24:03] <+FrostMass22> Mike would be an assist
[0:24:04] <Logan_Jennings1> Jay: Look at this creepy sex thing
[0:24:06] <+pleasenameyourcharacter> and Rich was on Ellen. Pat wasn't. actually, that's more like a debuff...
[0:24:06] <NavigatorBR> Pat would be the guy who pulls a fucking weapon in a fist fight.
[0:24:07] <Edwardsjack> Homestuck is crazy long, has great moments and is funny most of the time. It doesn’t stick the landing for a lot of folks and certain parts don’t hold up well.
[0:24:10] <zagardal> @PeachSaliva Rich Evans, Pat and Danny DeVito on coke
[0:24:14] <mercado94> THATS RIGHT JAY

[1:38:59] <+trnzero> That's not MY Luigi Final Smash
[1:39:00] <+breakdancinghobo> I dont think Paige knows the difference between tilts and smashes. when pat said "Side B" she did it like a Smash
[1:39:03] <OkamiDude15> @KaiserMario metaknight's ship with his face on the front
[1:39:04] <%YourFavoriteShiba> cheer500 Paige gotta hit dat side B.

[1:39:16] <@PlagueOfGripes> bowser's best move is to run into a side B
[1:39:17] <$mandragoraroot> jermaVenus
[1:39:17] <+badchoice5> Was that "Wave Dashing"
[1:39:21] <ryderbootz> become GIANT giant giant
[1:39:28] <%AbnormalVoid> Bowser's smash is OP
[1:39:29] <+tigerfang86> Luigi's Depression Dance was funny but it was really weird and they wanted to normalize final smashes
[1:39:30] <miguelrod777> Anime
[1:39:31] <e_d__> luigi's grab is so bad now

[1:39:53] <Fatman2124> As someone who mains Bowser this hurts me
[1:39:55] <CashewZero> @PeachSaliva Is there anything as hype as seeing the smash invitation during a trailer??
[1:39:55] <%goose_attack_almanac> Bowser seems to be pretty fast and have good recovery
[1:39:57] <cherubsanonymous> G A Y
[1:39:58] <eggsnbakefest> @PeachSaliva Hey there Paige and Pat! One of you guys should play Dedede and shit on the other person

[1:40:56] <%SuperCasualBoom> FeelSmellsMan...?
[1:40:58] <%legendfather_of_giants> @king_wragles organized by order they joined the series
[1:40:58] <Mattmandx1> I prefer Simon because he looks like a viking with all that fur

[1:41:16] <+NopeBadguy> @PeachSaliva Richter has stronger subweapons and a stronger slide and uppercut, which leads me to believe Simon probably has stronger whip moves/tippers.

[2:32:32] <+TeethMuncher> Get 2 stupid dogs
[2:32:34] <OwlLightningMage> Elmo wants a dog too
[2:32:36] <+BorinCorran> World of Light's biggest problem is that it's pretty unfair a good chunk of the time. It cheats. Including the gimmicks with stage hazards and items can make things difficult.
[2:32:37] <AlasterAngelo> most dogs are actually smarter than Pat
[2:32:39] <%JackMillerTime> yeah but you call elmo dumb and you love him
[2:32:46] <studleydoorite> just put Elmo through strength training till he has a six pack under his bag and he can open the fridge
[2:32:47] <Mr_Strut> But you'll never find a dog as stupid as Elmo.

[3:26:21] <%maskedriderhero> Crocodile Rock!
[3:26:27] <zamzoph> you didn't know Ridley's a dude?!
[3:26:28] <+cvp5127> are lizards furries?
[3:26:29] <+ryujinran> ridley is female in woolie's canon
[3:26:30] <%Keyd00d> I thought he always was
[3:26:32] <Picobat> hot
[3:26:33] <%Remery_> There's alot of female Ridley fanart
[3:26:40] <%MaximumDaximum> You only turn to dust if you're at a high percent
[3:26:42] <@Calek> explode into dust? you know who also did that? Sans
[3:26:42] <%AncelDeLambert> @FancyHatMan Right? But, what it REALLY makes me think of, is that time Dunkey beat Sky in Smash.
[3:26:43] <Naho_Saenoki> Ridley has ALWAYS been male.
[3:26:47] <Dragonfang1337> Zelda's suck in range is ridiculous
[3:26:47] <foreverN2dust> wow
[3:26:47] <%brave_sj> I like that Ridley also has to kill Samus whenever he does a Final Smash, just to be a dick
[3:26:48] <@Calek> Sans confirmed for Smash
[3:26:48] <e_d__> LUL
[3:26:48] <+JenovasPuppet> Pinky confirmed better than Ssaryn.
