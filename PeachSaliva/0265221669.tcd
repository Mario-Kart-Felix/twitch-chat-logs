[0:48:02] <%Keyd00d> TB ;_;
[0:48:11] <KillerKarite> his cancer was a roller coaster
[0:48:14] <DonatelloJose> OH my heart
[0:48:19] <%lamplight_> The warframe developer stream had to shut down. They were literally crying.
[0:48:20] <sjcodan> His liver was literally too fucked to even try that procedure on
[0:48:20] <SGrim> @DonatelloJose according to his wife's twitter, yes. LUL RIP LUL
[0:48:25] <LewdPatrol> The Gout is fiiiine LUL
[0:48:28] <+PipIV> last I knew of him was when they announced on the subreddit that he's stop doing reviews
[0:48:29] <Twoiis> He was getting 'better' as in he was being relieved from certain pain.
[0:48:30] <%Wistelligence> @PeachSaliva That's literally how I felt and you put it into words.
[0:48:31] <Darren716> I thought he'd have a few more months after he retired
[0:48:32] <$TheSniperJoe> TB was at the point where there were no other options, cept helping his day to day pain managment...it's really messed up.

[0:48:36] <Solidus_113> the Warframe Community Managers cancelled their Prime Time stream when they heard about it

[0:48:53] <Klefth> @ravencloak13 Like a way to pay respects maybe?
[0:48:53] <Caidezes> The Warframe stream was cancelled due to his death.

[0:49:22] <ravencloak13> @klefth I meant what was happening to make them kneel but I read the chat and understand.
[0:49:25] <%Wistelligence> Words weren't made for scenarios such as these.
[0:49:28] <%ziriken> anyone other than my parents dying would be like, "dang. that sucks."
