[0:42:07] <%GarbageNirvana> Jebus
[0:42:07] <Prism_Wing> disgusting
[0:42:08] <%swordsman70> The day you punched it out of the womb?
[0:42:09] <A_d3adly_zambo> Elmo late nite dumpster diving
[0:42:09] <G_Lancaster> what the fuck is your life even
[0:42:11] <heatrashes> paige leads such an interesting and wild life
[0:42:12] <%bigdumbidiotguy> in CPR classes you have to learn how to do it on a baby
[0:42:12] <%superorangerobin> CPR actually can fuck people up
[0:42:14] <+Skatedeandre> how
[0:42:14] <%cairo_cat> how much game did i miss?
[0:42:14] <katocrimson> 2 finger cpr
[0:42:16] <+LogothX> It must be from him smelling the Mc Donalds.
[0:42:17] <%Coystick> Why would you revive your prey?
[0:42:18] <MookStyfawker> I used to know how to do CPR on a dog. Never have, though.
[0:42:19] <$ThePuddingDead> DAMN
[0:42:20] <+SleepyFranke> WHAT
[0:42:21] <DXLelouch24> mcdonalds smelled sooooo bad he threw up, GOOD JOB PAIGE
[0:42:21] <%chiluzza> oh i guess thats fine
[0:42:21] <%Toynota10> Has he ever puked a hairball?
[0:42:21] <%bigdumbidiotguy> did you break the babies ribs?
[0:42:22] <%redstonej> the smell of McDonald's made him puje
[0:42:23] <%TheOnlyStrayCat> @Kaitepaints Tumblr imploded trying to deal with porn-bots, because Apple booted them from the app store for it.
[0:42:23] <%krawtch> was this after you gave the baby the CROSSFACE PEACH
[0:42:25] <+Badgerconda_> Wait, Paige gave Pat CPR?
[0:42:26] <Twoiis> I have first aid/cpr training.
[0:42:26] <adamisfruit> That baby has lupus now
[0:42:29] <%Dakuu75> Question: (That I could google but...) Where is the spot to push ecactly for CPR is it directly below the Sternum, that little triangle bown
[0:42:30] <%YourFavoriteShiba> The McDonald's smell finally got to him
[0:42:30] <%chiluzza> if you do it right you beat them up
[0:42:31] <mercado94> Was the baby a 36 years old named PAt?
[0:42:31] <%NWR_James> "Break the ribs"
[0:42:33] <%bigdumbidiotguy> cause usually you break their ribs
[0:42:34] <%PonyBoyPlays> My cat over eats when I leave for like 12 hours.
[0:42:37] <$Zero_Awakening> life > ribs tbh
[0:42:39] <MrSyne> And then you punted it for an extra point
[0:42:40] <LiquidMathew> I remember the ribs thing from Day 1 of CPR training
[0:42:41] <%RaikenTB> Elmo barfs in disgust at your McDonald's consumption.
[0:42:41] <$HentaiSenpai9K> @coystick 😂😂😂😂 Good one
[0:42:41] <$ThePuddingDead> gotta crab those ribs like a lobster to get that heart a pumpin
[0:42:47] <+badchoice5> Paige didn't try to abort that baby, she just "performed CPR"
[0:42:47] <%chiluzza> THATS BEATING THEM UP
[0:42:48] <%swordsman70> Baby ribs are easy to break
[0:42:48] <Hydrapissed> I mean its true demolish that chest
[0:42:48] <$ThePuddingDead> crack*
[0:42:54] <RCtiger0> You puncture the lungs if you break the ribs
[0:42:56] <echodrone81> fun fact, success rate of CPR outside a hospital is 5%
[0:42:56] <IminyourBase> no pat you don't get to their lungs you idiot
[0:42:58] <%bigdumbidiotguy> yeah I learned that in CPR class
[0:43:02] <Kaitepaints> @theonlystraycat I never used tumblr, what are porn bots?
[0:43:05] <DavidSanChan> push on chest, not stomach
[0:43:06] <%SuperCasualBoom> Break the ribs so you can make McRibs out of them rib cages
[0:43:07] <%Kazuhira_Boat> Sometimes I think your whole life is just an orgy of weird traumatic bullshit forever
[0:43:07] <SwindlerOfProgress> The objective is to break their ribcage.
[0:43:08] <%NWR_James> That is not a fun fact :(
[0:43:08] <%Djinnazz> you're not supposed to break their ribs...
[0:43:08] <G_Lancaster> if you do it right you steal their life essence for yourself as their soul fades away
[0:43:10] <DXLelouch24> Paige there are other sources of calories than Mcdonalds
[0:43:14] <Logan_Jennings1> "I lived but ow."
[0:43:14] <DXLelouch24> like pizza or something
[0:43:14] <%bigdumbidiotguy> half the time people dom't want to do CPR because of the liability
[0:43:14] <%AncelDeLambert> Get Elmo a cat pacemaker, JUST TO BE SURE
[0:43:14] <Hydrapissed> hell yeah u are
[0:43:14] <+FackinCrazy> I use a gun when i do cpr
[0:43:16] <+LogothX> "Sometimes, ribs do fracture or break. Unfortunately, ribs can fracture as the result of CPR chest compressions. While it isn't the case all of the time, it can happen. According to the statistics, about 30% of those who survive CPR wake up with a cracked sternum and/or broken rib." - Google
[0:43:16] <Hydrapissed> BREAK EM
[0:43:17] <%SuichiTanaka> sipsipBaby sipsipBaby sipsipBaby
[0:43:17] <LiquidMathew> CPR is usually used to buy more time not to save them
[0:43:17] <+DrunkenDice> Praise be to Paige!
[0:43:20] <mayorrev> Paige is Mercy
[0:43:21] <$ThePuddingDead> its meant to keep them stable not save them
[0:43:21] <Twoiis> It's like 10% with an AED.
[0:43:23] <grayjammer> You have, but not lately
[0:43:23] <Prism_Wing> Yupp..
[0:43:26] <%boldandsaucywrongs> Periscope
[0:43:27] <adamisfruit> “I didn’t want to be saved”
[0:43:27] <$HentaiSenpai9K> MEdical lessons with Pat FUCKBOIVIN
[0:43:27] <%PonyBoyPlays> Gotta do what you gotta do to try and save someone
[0:43:29] <+smargh1015> you have
[0:43:29] <%Pandora_Prime> That 5% statistic is bull.
[0:43:32] <%YourFavoriteShiba> That baby fuckin' owes you!
[0:43:32] <mercado94> now the baby will grow up to become a shonen protagonist
[0:43:34] <echodrone81> yup they did a study, cpr is basically masturbation
[0:43:38] <DecoyOctopus9> I thought it was the heart
[0:43:38] <lsandoval2020> Paige the hero
[0:43:40] <%bigdumbidiotguy> people can sue you for breaking their shit
[0:43:42] <%Toynota10> You should write a book on the cool things you've done
[0:43:42] <MookStyfawker> Hey, someone once sued a person for property damage because they broke down their door to save them from a fire.
[0:43:43] <%krawtch> isnt it actually closer to 2%
[0:43:44] <+CaptainJax> CPR doesn't actually save them the vast majority of the time, it keeps them alive long enough for EMTs to get there
[0:43:47] <$GohanEgret> that baby is going to grow up and be your guardian hero
[0:43:48] <+badchoice5> Well, considering how many lives you've taken (unborn or otherwise)...
[0:43:48] <%SuperCasualBoom> CPR = The worse healing spell
[0:43:49] <+DeadpanSoupcan> yeah resuscitation doesnt work very well
[0:43:50] <%JenovasPuppet> You should tell that story every time someone accuses you of killing babies
[0:43:51] <%Divryne> @PeachSaliva One of my roommates had to do CPR for a guest visiting his house and he didn't make it. :(
[0:43:53] <%ssjklyco> She saved a baby to counteract the woman she made not pregnant.
[0:43:54] <laserbeaming> Don't save people's lives!
[0:43:55] <IminyourBase> with hands like those i can only assume you are very good at CPR
[0:44:00] <%Pandora_Prime> It's more like 15%
[0:44:01] <eisore> Have we seen a house tour yet?
[0:44:03] <%NWR_James> Break their femur doing CPR
[0:44:03] <%swordsman70> 0.5%
[0:44:13] <IminyourBase> it is a percent
[0:44:14] <Twitchypyro> 500%
[0:44:14] <californaya> "Don't help anyone ever" - Pat
[0:44:15] <%krawtch> sounds like its a made up statistic
[0:44:16] <%NigelSchnauzerpug> It's actuall 39%
[0:44:16] <mercado94> i said is 13%
[0:44:16] <+LogothX> Why would somebody on the internet lie
[0:44:17] <Logan_Jennings1> Statistics are bullshit.
[0:44:18] <Hydrapissed> its negative percent
[0:44:22] <%AncelDeLambert> isn't it low because most people do it wrong?
[0:44:22] <%cairo_cat> how long has the stream been going for?
[0:44:23] <Fujiwara_92> ITS 1998%
[0:44:24] <+FackinCrazy> 90%
[0:44:25] <$ThePuddingDead> i thought cpr was meant to keep people stable until help arrives right?
[0:44:27] <$Sphincter_Spelunker> 80% of all statistics are made up on the spot @PeachSaliva
[0:44:29] <CrimsonCore90> Don't do it if you're not certified?
[0:44:29] <%rdark_ksu> He was planning to eat that later
[0:44:30] <echodrone81> outside a medical setting
[0:44:30] <+CPMilkman> Elmo knows what he has done
[0:44:32] <%Dingalow> It's actually 700%
[0:44:32] <DatAsuna> Only 6% of these statistics aren't made up
[0:44:33] <%SuperCasualBoom> You thinking Milk or CPR?
[0:44:33] <%redstonej> he wanted to eat it
[0:44:36] <+languagelearning> It's not high, let's leave it at that.
[0:44:37] <%heatbugg> Did you know 63% of all statistics are made up on the spot?
[0:44:37] <Twoiis> I was told closer to 5%. I went into cpr training 2 weeks ago.
[0:44:37] <Kaitepaints> Don’t listen to chat Paige, look it up
[0:44:38] <+badchoice5> Is the success rate greater than your chances of surviving choking to death normally? Good enough for me
[0:44:40] <%bigdumbidiotguy> my cat looks like a less fluffy version of elmo
[0:44:41] <%mistymntns> I have a playlist on Spotify that has like 20 songs that is the right BPM for CPR
[0:44:42] <%RaikenTB> we need a barfing elmo emoji
[0:44:42] <adamisfruit> It’s not too great
[0:44:42] <mayorrev> "Oh you went backpacking in colorado? have i ever told you about the time i SURVIVED FALLING FROM 12,500 FEET"
[0:44:42] <%Pandora_Prime> EMTs only work outside of hospitals. Once they get to the hospital the ER nurses take over
[0:44:44] <IminyourBase> he vomited there, he knows he vomited there, but it's gone and he doesn't know how
[0:44:49] <%bigdumbidiotguy> carciOWO carciOWO carciOWO
[0:44:49] <MookStyfawker> 87% out of five statistics are just made up bullshit.
[0:44:53] <Prism_Wing> CPR actually casts an AOE that blocks other people's breathing.
[0:44:55] <$vectorcannonready> Seasonal candy time! I got me some peppermint bark Oreo's.
[0:44:58] <%NigelSchnauzerpug> 75% of the time CPR works 100% of the time
[0:44:59] <DXLelouch24> give him a breath treat or his breath will smell like death, if my Dogs any indication
[0:45:01] <G_Lancaster> whadda ya buying
[0:45:02] <TerraWraith> The overall rate of survival that leads to hospital discharge for someone who experiences cardiac arrest is about 10.6 percent, the study authors note. But most participants in the study estimated it at more than 75 percent.
[0:45:05] <valriot> Lebonese Nuts
[0:45:06] <%SuichiTanaka> It seems to fluxuate a lot depending on where the study is done. Anywhere from 5% to 15%
[0:45:10] <%TheOnlyStrayCat> @Kaitepaints Automated blogs trying to push their porn sites by following real blogs and/or adding adverts on posts unrelated to porn.
[0:45:11] <%AncelDeLambert> if you can keep their brains from dying long enough to get them to a hospital, you can save them nowadays
[0:45:12] <$ooblagis> Google says that just random mother fucker doing CPR in the street has an 8% success rate. Still better than 0% though
[0:45:15] <%cairo_cat> this is making me hungry
[0:45:18] <Sotetsu> Lebanoff
[0:45:19] <%Toynota10> Paige is part lebonese?
[0:45:21] <clonexsniperx> i also feel like people don't report that if they are saved by CPR and just try to walk it off
[0:45:24] <grayjammer> @valriot that wasnt funny but i still laughed
[0:45:24] <%Archer2150> Lebanon, Charlse de Gaulle, California baseball
[0:45:25] <%SuperCasualBoom> 9 out of 10 people agree 1 will disagree with other 9
[0:45:25] <el_phthalo> Elmo screm?
[0:45:26] <%AncelDeLambert> like, we're shockingly good at saving people nowadays
[0:45:27] <LiquidMathew> |90 percent of people who suffer cardiac arrest die prior to reaching a hospital or medical care facility. Effective CPR provided by a bystander in the first few minutes of cardiac arrest can increase the chances of survival by 2x or 3x."
[0:45:30] <katocrimson> Ginger lebanese?
[0:45:30] <$HentaiSenpai9K> Lebanese Kebab is the best
[0:45:32] <%NWR_James> Nobody would pay for this
[0:45:32] <%chiluzza> ill take 8% over being dead

[0:45:48] <Ayru_> was the tube lebanese?

[0:46:09] <Kaitepaints> Do you want to hear a depressing statistic? @peachsaliva
[0:46:10] <echodrone81> The initial success rate of cardiopulmonary resuscitation was equal to 15.3%, while the ultimate success rate (discharged alive from the hospital) was as 10.6%. The six-month success rate after resuscitation was 8.78% than those who were discharged alive. ***

[1:22:42] <echodrone81> where woolie stream?
[1:22:43] <%swordsman70> I want to see his FEET!
[1:22:44] <+badchoice5> Woolie doesn't interact with the chat, since he can't read
[1:22:44] <mrjohncarlton> We saw but didn't hear it Kappa
[1:22:44] <+Nomicro4u> ***
[1:22:45] <%castcode> WOOLSWORTH
[1:22:45] <@Calek> Woolie did a great stream, but he has to take it easy on himself
[1:22:45] <%Breakfast_Megapowers> I wasn't able to catch it :(
[1:22:45] <@akuda_bar> woolie streams muted for ten minutes
[1:22:47] <OwlLightningMage> Woolie streams Hunter X Hunter Kappa
[1:22:48] <%Dingalow> the Woolie Vs Show
[1:22:48] <+FrostMass22> You don't need to. he can be nice to you and he did donate money, but he's still such a dramawhoring liar.
[1:22:48] <katocrimson> FEET
[1:22:49] <$ThePuddingDead> imma follow
[1:22:50] <%TaifuDragon> WoolieVersus, the finest stream for your left ear alone
[1:22:50] <Sotetsu> Woolie's streams are adorable.
[1:22:51] <nepwar> i like woolie stream because hes all about A S T H E T I C
[1:22:51] <Kristoffers> that was his first?
[1:22:51] <mayorrev> woolies epic trashfire

[1:22:52] <BourneWarrior> It was Chill AF
[1:22:52] <DukeMoose> Woolies that guy that plays dnd on Up up down down right?
[1:22:52] <RCtiger0> So what did he stream?
[1:22:55] <%bigdumbidiotguy> is woolie going to magfest?
[1:22:56] <cj_art> i heard woolie streamed a VR game for an hour with his mic muted
[1:22:56] <Laironx3> Woolie's intro is godlike
[1:22:57] <%SuperCasualBoom> Muted Puzzles was fun
[1:22:57] <RoseeLocks> How do you get into streaming?
[1:22:58] <%SaltyDongs> is he streaming now
[1:23:00] <Twitchypyro> Tetris @RCtiger0
[1:23:00] <G_Lancaster> 30 minute muted mic tho
[1:23:00] <@akuda_bar> no it's just vs
[1:23:02] <+Dhrall> I was kind of amazed how interesting it was to watch Tetris

[1:23:05] <deviljhojho94> chill streams with my main man woolie crikChamp
[1:23:05] <%JenovasPuppet> @RCtiger0 Tetris Effect and Rez
[1:23:06] <+tweedler92> I'll watch when he streams talkies
[1:23:11] <ProRJHunter> Woolie streaming without audio for a little bit,made me laugh so hard
[1:23:13] <%swordsman70> Is scissor man what long haired girls see Woolie as?
[1:23:13] <ShadowZiggy> Just do it yo
[1:23:14] <$Sphincter_Spelunker> @PeachSaliva You were shit posting like cray on Woolie's stream. Proud of you
[1:23:14] <resenterna> will u cuck me with black male plsssssss
[1:23:15] <bingobangoboingobongo> where is pat BabyRage
[1:23:17] <adamisfruit> Killstream is eh imo. Primarily because they hang with 4chad, who’s a psycho who can’t stand that’s he gay.
[1:23:18] <Shiranui24> aww man i should go to magfest
[1:23:18] <NiftyNox> dewit
[1:23:20] <CatmanIX> is he posting the VOd to youtube? i missed that stream due to things
[1:23:20] <krymzen5> woolie talked about his schedule and he keeps himself very busy.
[1:23:20] <%chiluzza> its a gold standard for frienders to have muted mics
[1:23:20] <$ThePuddingDead> patience, gumption and drink lots of juice
[1:23:24] <grayjammer> Man Woolie needed to lighten up on himself. he was better at tetris than he wasa giving himself credit for
[1:23:24] <%Toynota10> Get some friends and stream!
[1:23:25] <IminyourBase> she clapped and turned her head really fast and said "what did i do wrong?" and i thought for a second pat hit her
[1:23:26] <%bigdumbidiotguy> I guess I get to meet most of the gang, then!
[1:23:26] <RoseeLocks> I'm wanting to do it, when I get back from vacation
[1:23:26] <+DeadpanSoupcan> woolie had a rough stream
[1:23:27] <Sotetsu> Woah! Slow down!
[1:23:27] <%ssjklyco> Get a cat before you stream
[1:23:28] <%SuichiTanaka> @krawtch it's not. If you looked into it, St. Jude's refused the donations because they didn't want anything to do with that element.
[1:23:31] <roboguy2k> how do you stream with 0 charisma and 0 audience to play off of?
[1:23:38] <%AncelDeLambert> ???
[1:23:40] <Prism_Wing> shit is humble, so you better like it lol.
[1:23:41] <Fujiwara_92> LUL
[1:23:44] <%AncelDeLambert> who was naughty?
[1:23:45] <%Picabunny> Now I need to know
[1:23:45] <+badchoice5> Hell, I have a friend who streams, just hops on and does whatever
[1:23:47] <%GarbageNirvana> It helps to be associated with someone who's already internet famous
[1:23:48] <$ThePuddingDead> just chill
[1:23:48] <%mostundesired> Ayoooooo
[1:23:50] <Kristoffers> hahah
[1:23:51] <heatrashes> what happened???
[1:23:51] <Worldbrand> Well it ain't for everyone, so the honest truth is that maybe you don't
[1:23:54] <%bigdumbidiotguy> you dont stream
[1:23:55] <DXLelouch24> get a Pet
[1:23:55] <%krawtch> @SuichiTanaka st. jude's never had the money to begin with. youtube refunded it about 60 days before they ever would have received it.
[1:23:56] <%colouroftheiris77> Yeah that was weird.
[1:23:57] <$ThePuddingDead> u dont even have to talk to anyone
[1:23:58] <DXLelouch24> bitches love pets
[1:23:58] <Kristoffers> no facecam I suppose
[1:23:59] <$HentaiSenpai9K> Have you ever thought of being a guest on the friend cast?
[1:23:59] <LeeOhX> I think it helps talking to yourself
[1:23:59] <DukeMoose> public speaking is a trip
[1:23:59] <%GarbageNirvana> Not that Paige doesn't carry these on her own of course
[1:24:01] <OwlLightningMage> Everyone needs their streaming safety skeleton
[1:24:01] <%CappuccinoGuil> Are you looking for performance or technical questions?
[1:24:03] <nepwar> fake a robbery
[1:24:06] <$ThePuddingDead> it helps to know someone to piggy back off os
[1:24:07] <$GohanEgret> there is a website that shows you twitch streams with 0 viewers
[1:24:08] <$ThePuddingDead> of*
[1:24:09] <+comb711> I have to wait until there's at least one person
[1:24:11] <G_Lancaster> get a skeleton and a steve buschemi photo
[1:24:13] <Sotetsu> That is what the cat is for.
[1:24:13] <%SuperCasualBoom> Ask Fortnite streamers *rimshot*
[1:24:13] <%mostundesired> I recommend playing a thing that nobody plays to develop an audience, first of all.
[1:24:16] <$ThePuddingDead> networking is a plus
[1:24:16] <mercado94> the trick is to eat trash with a cat on camera for easy money
[1:24:20] <Laironx3> Is Paige the anti-DIO?
[1:24:21] <%SuichiTanaka> @krawtch St. Jude's refused the funding, which is handled by YouTube
[1:24:23] <+DeadpanSoupcan> oof
[1:24:24] <IminyourBase> is it dedication or delusion?
[1:24:27] <katocrimson> Max has some equipment videos to help beginners get started but those vids are a bit old though, but still good advise from him
[1:24:29] <%swordsman70> The real champs
[1:24:35] <+vaporousTippler> Streaming the right game makes the difference.
[1:24:36] <$ThePuddingDead> dont you mean the ANIT-Donna!?

[1:24:59] <Worldbrand> @RCtiger0 Yeah, the haunting/curse clearly worked
[1:25:00] <$Sphincter_Spelunker> Yikes
[1:25:00] <+badchoice5> People, quick, keep donating, subscribing, and chatting, it's all that stands between us and the unholy ressurection of Yang!
[1:25:05] <Shiranui24> I've thought about trying to stream but i havent actually done anything to start
[1:25:05] <%SiameseSneeze> Yeah, BDO has great character customization, super mediocre game overall though
[1:25:06] <Fujiwara_92> 24 YEARS
[1:25:07] <$Sphincter_Spelunker> getting old
[1:25:12] <%krawtch> @SuichiTanaka youtube then refunded it to white supremacists and nazis, instead of giving it to charity like their ToS says
[1:25:13] <%AncelDeLambert> wait, hold on.... one..... twooo HOLY SHIT IT CHECKS OUT!

[1:25:30] <%CappuccinoGuil> Paige, you should sit down with Pat and give him fashion advice on his cowboy shooty bang bang simulator
[1:25:35] <deviljhojho94> that was fun 4Head
[1:25:40] <Worldbrand> 12 minutes or so

[1:25:53] <+Zairthos> They weren’t nazis though
[1:25:55] <%SuichiTanaka> @krawtch It doesn't matter, the post was completely misleading and untrue. It wasn't the WSJ stealing cancer kid money. It was StJude not wanting anything to do with that shitty element.
[1:25:57] <SGrim> Just over 12 minutes
[1:25:57] <+badchoice5> He couldn't read the people telling him he was muted
[1:25:57] <Laironx3> Feelsbad
[1:25:59] <+FrostMass22> Pat could have a whole stream of trying on clothes in Red Dead 2
[1:26:02] <%bigdumbidiotguy> that's so genuine of Woolie
[1:26:04] <%JenovasPuppet> Poor Billy was trying to call him

[1:26:08] <%bigdumbidiotguy> woolie is the man.
[1:26:11] <%JenovasPuppet> Woolie had his phone muted
[1:26:17] <%SuichiTanaka> @PeachSaliva it's cool. We'll drop it.
[1:26:21] <+badchoice5> The stream is about KEEPING YANG IN THE GROUND
[1:26:27] <+nanitchi> i guess i missed the stream? :{
[1:26:33] <%Dingalow> Is Woolie officially a boomer?
[1:26:34] <%NocturneNovember> cheer250 Pat brought up getting hit with a light tube earlier in the stream. I was curious if he had heard about David Arquette getting hit in the throat with a light tube during a deathmatch at a wrestling show this past weekend? If not, look it up, shit's nuts.
[1:26:34] <mercado94> someday Woolie will be as big and strong as Paige
[1:26:34] <$GohanEgret> @nanitchi nope
[1:26:36] <nepwar> Woolie also being a trailblazer by opting to sleep in trash instead of having a sick intro made for strem

[2:47:24] <vindaxxv> i learnt that dance move = kiss
[2:47:25] <LiquidMathew> Periscope is where we watched Pat do the weird bed tihng
[2:47:25] <Logan_Jennings1> That's not hard to do
[2:47:26] <nepwar> reading and fighting pat over ham sandwiches
[2:47:43] <+FrostMass22> Tumblr is so dumb
[2:47:45] <%JenovasPuppet> Eh?
[2:47:45] <%sevar435> This is beautiful sipsipElmo
[2:47:45] <bentface> @liquidmathew Legendary Lore
[2:47:45] <$awsomesaucekirby> cheer232 REMINDER: amy is canonically 11, who used a magic ring to wish for an adult body, BIG style
[2:47:50] <Logan_Jennings1> Wtf happened to Tumblr?
[2:47:51] <SGrim> @vindaxxv don't forget that ball problems = gay SeemsGood
[2:47:51] <+FrostMass22> Management, not the users
[2:47:53] <Snookasaurus> all my fav artists got deleted
[2:47:54] <Shiranui24> what happened to tumbler?
[2:47:55] <mayorrev> @PeachSaliva they're restoring accounts apparently
[2:47:56] <CatmanIX> wait, what happened to tumblr/
[2:47:57] <srkAres> tumblr is not dead. its just stupid for a while. its a retarded puppy, basically.
[2:47:59] <jeecay> no tumblr. but where will everyone post their SFM porn?
[2:48:02] <TheNeedlesD> did I miss it, is Yang still dead?
[2:48:04] <krymzen5> all the big media sires are kinda dying
[2:48:08] <%Toynota10> Dragon's Dogma is on sale for $10 on Fanatical if anyone else wants to buy it!
[2:48:09] <krymzen5> sites*
[2:48:12] <%SuperPixelRush> @awsomesaucekirby that's in the Archie comics tho
[2:48:12] <+FrostMass22> IT was a "glitch"
[2:48:13] <%Keyd00d> @TheNeedlesD He was alive the whole time
[2:48:15] <$SweetCheeksTrap> Oh that's nice
[2:48:17] <CatmanIX> @TheNeedlesD as it turns out, Yang wasn't dead all along
[2:48:19] <Liwyn> the smut was the only reason to go on tumblr
[2:48:20] <Zaphire_Saucypants> Yang was never dead
[2:48:22] <Liwyn> rip
[2:48:23] <SubjectTea> The porn bots are taking over
[2:48:27] <%king_wragles> He was just asleep
[2:48:28] <%furiousfurioso> the story I heard is they made a bot to remove all the NSFW stuff but it counted stuff that porn bots commented into totally safe normal accounts, so everyone's gettin falsly banned
[2:48:29] <Zaphire_Saucypants> but he still looks on anguish.
[2:48:31] <JJ92> like, who wrote these fanfics and why
[2:48:32] <nepwar> yang just needed a drink
[2:48:33] <C_S_N_G> Yang was healed by pot
[2:48:33] <Logan_Jennings1> Pot saves lives, you heard it here first folks
[2:48:34] <+Trekalone> yeah, this happens every now and then. Tmblr'll be back to normal in like a week
[2:48:34] <%clifin> why isn't Pat suffering with us?
[2:48:38] <$SweetCheeksTrap> @PeachSaliva That's good to hear, because my account is SUPER NSFW D:
[2:48:38] <Mordox> pot saves
[2:48:39] <%JenovasPuppet> Yang will continue to be dead in our hearts

[4:09:55] <Ayru_> elmo barfing was my favorite part of the stream
[4:09:55] <DestroyerDJ8> i learned too much about Amy Schumer
[4:09:56] <$SweetCheeksTrap> I learned too many things
[4:09:57] <SwindlerOfProgress> Not really.
[4:09:58] <%JenovasPuppet> I learned about Sonic's weird ball problem
[4:09:59] <%SuperCasualBoom> @peachsaliva I still had two more donations but don’t worry or be sorry Paige. Shitty technology sometimes
[4:10:01] <SaltBuster> I learned that you can't beat off cum.

[4:10:18] <%SuperPixelRush> @PeachSaliva the chat created new lore while you were on the phone with Elise, she's dating Tarkus
[4:10:24] <+Ryosuke91> It's you I like, It's not the things you wear, It's not the way you do your hair But it's you I like The way you are right now, The way down deep inside you Not the things that hide you, Not your toys They're just beside you. But it's you I like Every part of you. Your skin, your eyes, your feelings Whether old or new. I hope that you'll remember Even when you're feeling blue That it's you I like, It's you yourself It's you. It's you I like.
[4:10:27] <+cirilionaire> I learned I like gossip way too much.
[4:10:27] <Zaphire_Saucypants> You're the Bee's Knees.
[4:10:28] <nepwar> its not the lessons we learned but the friends me made along the way
