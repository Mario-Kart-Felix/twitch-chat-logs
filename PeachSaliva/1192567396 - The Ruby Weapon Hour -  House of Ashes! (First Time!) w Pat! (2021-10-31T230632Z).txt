[1:24:19] <%Sotetsu> I feel like metal bars would be incredibly expensive in 2100bc
[1:24:24] <+SilverDevilfish> That guy killed a lot of babies to make that necklace

[1:24:40] <GarbageQueenEllie> It's the FAT EVIL
[1:24:42] <MarsKarl> Oh man, could this be Assyria or Mesopotamia?
[1:24:42] <%ChrisPlaysThing> Poggers God
[1:24:42] <%justicecadet> let's hear PP guesses
[1:24:42] <dds333a> @sotetsu not as much as you'd think LUL
[1:24:42] <+DatAsuna> It's all a mortal kombat realm
[1:24:44] <%tempestzephyr> NO SPOIL
[1:24:46] <MrPandastic> King may be a little nutty.
[1:24:47] <+JonathLP> Our cups of lead make us strong!
[1:24:49] <MarsKarl> Darius?
[1:24:51] <+DatAsuna> shao khan comes in and breaks all their backs
[1:24:51] <stantheman_97> the Mesopotamians understood style
[1:24:51] <Martian571> bronze or just copper
[1:24:56] <$DEETRz> thats some sick glam tho
[1:24:56] <zephlink> Lead
[1:24:56] <LunarRemix> Also that would happen with every single king if that were the case in that era
[1:24:57] <+TimberWulfe> No Spoilers chat
[1:24:58] <drunken_lemur> I thought it was lead?
[1:24:58] <yetipotato> Wow palace that looks like a dude
[1:24:59] <$Tredecian> silver or mercury?
[1:25:00] <+sjay662> the king is high?
[1:25:00] <%UselessBathHouse> its the cum in the water
[1:25:01] <%greasypete00> people do just be crazy sometimes
[1:25:01] <%faintsmile> that temple looks SICK
[1:25:01] <dds333a> still not iron age though
[1:25:01] <Monkeyweed21> THE GOD HAND?
[1:25:02] <$dorgbork> Also that'd basically be Medan again "the weird chemical made everyone crazy"
[1:25:06] <matsu_me> gief said remove chat
[1:25:06] <T_Sasquatch> egypt kicks ass
[1:25:07] <+MrMcCrabby> it's all a dream, the king is the bus driver

[1:25:09] <SinnerEbru> wait silver makes u crazy???
[1:25:10] <%BogBodyPositive> silver makes you nuts??
[1:25:11] <+Grave_Titan_D> silver will turn your skin blue
[1:25:12] <hearingthenseeing> WAIT I WENT TO TAKE A DUMP AND SHE KILLED A WOMAN ALREADY??
[1:25:12] <churropoppa> silver drives you crazy?
[1:25:12] <+Ches_Neckbeard> arsnic comes out of the copper smelting process so yes it could be that
[1:25:12] <%JoshManVGH> Silver, really?
[1:25:14] <Ipsenscastle> silver makes you nuts? what?
[1:25:14] <+ReallyBigRocks> blinded
[1:25:15] <+NWR_James> I mean they used arsenic to make bronze so who knows
[1:25:15] <blue8moon> this would be solidly in the bronze age I believe
[1:25:15] <thelonechris> Don't look directly at it, moron
[1:25:16] <RickyRelucent> orther then the kings who gained an immunity trough exposure
[1:25:17] <%ChrisPlaysThing> Drink the Mercury, it gives us magic powers and visions!
[1:25:18] <$Tredecian> dont look at the eclipse idiot
[1:25:20] <%faintsmile> eclipse???
[1:25:21] <dds333a> silver poisoning LUL
[1:25:22] <+sjay662> Time to use the Behelit
[1:25:23] <%Sotetsu> Let's play the sun stare game.
[1:25:23] <AMajorTom> Only look during totality
[1:25:24] <yetipotato> His house is a dude
[1:25:24] <+Bailey__Gaming> eclipses always had these effects
[1:25:25] <GarbageQueenEllie> Oh no he read Twilight
[1:25:26] <RedaiRmex> silver won't make you crazy dpafuq pat?
[1:25:27] <%justicecadet> the setting, details are amazing
[1:25:27] <%THATGUY_789> perhaps Mercury
[1:25:29] <dds333a> it is somewhat real
[1:25:29] <Ipsenscastle> is Pat getting mixed up with Quicksilver?
[1:25:31] <MrPandastic> Immediately more interesting than Little Hope.
[1:25:33] <nomolomo> solar eclipses were the scariest thing back in the day
[1:25:33] <HotSauceFiend> are these manifestations of a subconcious?
[1:25:34] <%ennui_on_me> eh they probably didn't have the eclipse figured out back then
[1:25:35] <+geekjacob> is this the time where you drank mercury to cure everything
[1:25:35] <$cgreene64> Yeah this already looks better at least
[1:25:37] <Treasure_Vault> Are they killing themselves?
[1:25:37] <+SwipperSwapper> mole people??
[1:25:37] <@MelBrooksKA> Fun fact, ancient people did not like eclipses
[1:25:39] <Dr_Mooose> oh yeah
[1:25:41] <mikesapartment> remember when piccolo blew up the moon
[1:25:42] <Zaphire_Saucypants> yeah it is MUCH better
[1:25:42] <RedaiRmex> Mercury is silver colored and can among other things
[1:25:44] <%justicecadet> also way more interesting color palette
[1:25:45] <leonsnixon> Could be lead poisoning as well
[1:25:46] <Chaos_Aether> uh
[1:25:46] <%ChrisPlaysThing> Silver will jsut cause argyria
[1:25:51] <Treasure_Vault> Those bad guys weren't real, right?
[1:25:52] <%greasypete00> monstahs
[1:25:53] <%Sotetsu> The Moon Army blocked out the sun!
[1:25:55] <matsu_me> when?

[1:25:58] <ape_hawk> MOON GOD = WEREWOLVES
[1:26:00] <Valentinius_Anodyne> I've only seen the intro, but it is pretty cool from what I saw

[1:26:17] <%optimasmaximas> oh
[1:26:20] <blue8moon> he looks very dead
[1:26:21] <%ennui_on_me> the documentary Berserk makes it very clear that you should not trust an eclipse
[1:26:23] <stantheman_97> i saw an eclipse and yeah i can understand why they would think it's an apocalypse
[1:26:25] <SinnerEbru> oh
[1:26:25] <MarsKarl> he is now a red and gooey king

[1:27:36] <+bread_assassin> Impaling is just a REALLY good stab.
[1:27:39] <blue8moon> well, vampires don't like sun, and it's a solar eclipse, so that would make sene
[1:27:39] <%QueequegTheater> I'm still shocked Paige never murdered Lucatiel
[1:27:39] <+dalmek> no John, you are the demons

[1:28:12] <Zeif00> They've got great teeth

[1:56:30] <DXLelouch24> @PeachSaliva dont worry about the traits, they dont matter this time
[1:56:33] <UndeadManatee> unveil rug please
[1:56:36] <BoxNavy> this games not bad
[1:56:37] <Coystick> I'm impressed by the rug
[1:56:39] <skullneedles> this game looks awesome compared to the last two
[1:56:39] <$Sphincter_Spelunker> @KeiganOfAstora 1st inning Grand Slam by the Braves
[1:56:40] <+DatAsuna> man of medan sucked too
[1:56:41] <akitanito> Little Hope was there to lower your expectation
[1:56:41] <DXLelouch24> SHIT
[1:56:41] <@SoFarFetched> did you notice the reuse of characters Paige?
[1:56:44] <%KeiganOfAstora> DAMN
[1:56:46] <blue8moon> Little Hope was the worst one LUL
[1:56:46] <ape_hawk> little hope more like lotta nope
[1:56:46] <%king_wragles> Little Hope smells of B Team tbh
[1:56:47] <Ipsenscastle> little hope just sucked is all
[1:56:47] <+sjay662> IMO this is the best of the 3 by leaps and bounds
[1:56:48] <dds333a> the outlier?
[1:56:49] <Zaphire_Saucypants> It came out BEFORE covid
[1:56:51] <bob900000> I don't think so
[1:56:52] <drunken_lemur> ***
[1:56:57] <%KeiganOfAstora> Braves basically have this
[1:56:58] <twistedj3ster> there was a gas leak in the office, it's fine now
[1:57:00] <skullneedles> they're stretching themselves thin making these one every year
[1:57:01] <$SiameseSneeze> 2019
[1:57:02] <KaseKaizer> they matter for a couple of things
[1:57:02] <AdmiralButtloaf> it was written before covid tho
[1:57:02] <%KeiganOfAstora> But develpment tho
[1:57:03] <dds333a> I think it's just the outlier
[1:57:08] <NeroInfinite> 2019
[1:57:08] <Latija> some of the technical issues might be because of covid but little hope's writing is so bad there's no excuse
[1:57:08] <+CalderGaming> (chat, is this a break or the end)
[1:57:09] <afronooch> last october i wanna
[1:57:11] <afronooch> say
[1:57:11] <+sjay662> Covid was 2020
[1:57:12] <+DatAsuna> it came out 2020, but was clearly made before covoid yeah
[1:57:14] <DXLelouch24> @PeachSaliva Covid doesnt force you to make a bad story
[1:57:14] <generalve> @peachsaliva don't let pat cheat on his ass Kappa
[1:57:15] <skullneedles> @CalderGaming yes
[1:57:16] <mikesapartment> october 2020
[1:57:16] <%KeiganOfAstora> starting calder
[1:57:17] <$SiameseSneeze> no wait, it came out in 2020
[1:57:18] <BoxNavy> @CalderGaming break
[1:57:19] <+dalmek> @CalderGaming break
[1:57:22] <+TimberWulfe> Maybe Little Hope was the B team of Supermassive. maybe even C.
[1:57:23] <%Agami23> little hope was a rip off of a movie that was a cult classic that had a similar twist
[1:57:23] <+CalderGaming> thx all
[1:57:23] <cherrycottontail> it's almost assuredly a "different director/team/writer" issue
[1:57:24] <blue8moon> I think it's just whoever wrote it did a bad job LUL
[1:57:24] <AdmiralButtloaf> but the writing is still bad
[1:57:25] <Ipsenscastle> talented people can still make bad things, it was just a misfire conceptually
[1:57:26] <+AgniBrandt> Little Hope was 2020
[1:57:28] <+sjay662> Man of Medan was 2019
[1:57:29] <+RyanTheRecluse> little hope October 2020
[1:57:29] <bippityjones> Covid gave them more time to iron out the stupid (so far)

[1:58:07] <$SiameseSneeze> the cucking is better
[1:58:09] <HaroldDonchee> is farting against tsa
[1:58:12] <$Mothman742> IMHO this one is the best one since Until Dawn
[1:58:12] <DXLelouch24> atmosphere is great
[1:58:17] <+MarkoTolstov> and no locked camera angles!
[1:58:18] <Mattais88> Maybe it just had more time to cook
[1:58:20] <+xiccy> Oct 30 2020 was Little Hope's release date
[1:58:20] <+realm_forge> Pat is literally in danger of combustion at all times

[2:13:48] <VritraReiRei> @PeachSaliva the birds dont necessarily mean something bad, it just means you made an important decision with a CONSEQUENCE i.e. your choice had an influence on the story

[2:24:09] <Baljhet> is it really a war crime if you white phosphorize monsters?
[2:24:10] <LordMung> To be fair, I think being overbearing to help prevent WAR CRIMES is a-ok.

[2:24:34] <ape_hawk> yeah but willy pete is like, at least ten torches
[2:24:34] <HaroldDonchee> that dude needs to learn to whistle more than the same 4 notes

[3:26:13] <Aleate> I don't even know what that is
[3:26:14] <$evermoore_hex> what the fuck fuck is canadaforme

[3:26:18] <RetroCop87> the average world history colelge student, yeah
[3:26:18] <Jack964b> So Pat just wants to be playing Shadow's of the Damned so he can be a talking gun?
[3:26:19] <+eggmilk__> You'd know it's old, but not the term cuneiform
[3:26:19] <+athuramn> only if you were probing that area of knowledge
[3:26:20] <%lord_of_iron_kingdom> No I didn't know that's the name of it tbh
[3:26:20] <TheBigPutty> i'm not that well versed

[3:26:23] <+FelIian> never heard of it
[3:26:23] <Melchior_the_Wise> you think they'd know what cuneiform looks like
[3:26:24] <%BogBodyPositive> I wouldn't say average person but yea obviously ancient
[3:26:24] <+MidnightBurst12> people don't pay attention in school
[3:26:25] <tanarath> Pat, you're very well educated
[3:26:25] <LLCoolZJ> I learned about cuniform in grade school
[3:26:26] <DashXero> It's writing etched into tablets with a wedge. What else would it be?!
[3:26:27] <%theshillman> time for slip-n-slide
[3:26:28] <Zaphire_Saucypants> A triangle stick
[3:26:28] <friedsquidiot> I wasn’t taught that until college

[3:26:32] <%KeiganOfAstora> NERD
[3:26:33] <RedaiRmex> but you can touch something and get a read on how old it is honestly
[3:26:34] <Aussie_Manny> The knowledge of what cuneiform is, is not common.
[3:26:34] <+disgruntledgruntle> U should rewatch the last premonition @PeachSaliva
[3:26:37] <Gehtingsberg> people are ignorant
[3:26:38] <SGrim> They used a stylus, not a stick, Pat
[3:26:39] <Zaphire_Saucypants> yeah

[3:26:49] <Treasure_Vault> used to use a lead stick. that's why it's called lead in a pencil when it's graphite
[3:26:49] <deviljhojho_> watch it there brother
[3:26:50] <NeoCre> I would have had no idea others than “it’s old”
[3:26:51] <%TimberWulfe> most history classes skipped Mesopotamia and go straight for Egypt

[3:27:00] <+Anime_Flux> PUSH
[3:27:01] <HeroToxiko> you learn about it in social studies, they used sharpened reeds to carve

[3:27:33] <$Niney_Who> If you don't tie a rope to each other you're immortal
[3:27:35] <Aussie_Manny> They made that look WAY harder than it actually would be. LUL
[3:27:40] <sightlesspoem> fuckin just a dialogue choice comes on "woman youre heavier than a sack of bricks"
[3:27:43] <drifterdabs> Remember the premonition from Little Hope where you but the rope? CUT THE ROPE
[3:27:45] <+ReallyBigRocks> the rope is a metaphor for marraige

[3:44:36] <@SoFarFetched> AND not wearing contacts
[3:44:37] <Wynzler> By a pretty large margin
[3:44:38] <KaitlynnHere> @sofarfetched not surprised
[3:44:43] <Sitromxe> @cherrycottontail Maybe the link is incidental. They were looking to Alexander's tomb but ended up digging up Sumerian Dracula instead.
[3:44:44] <Mattais88> @cherrycottontail Doesn't mean he didn't stop by after the country was long  gone
[3:44:45] <Krisaeron> Pat and Paige currently  smashing

[3:54:11] <DashXero> @ape_hawk If they talk out their feelings, they can die at peace. It makes the meat taste better.

[4:11:25] <NeoCre> I need some of that copium
[4:11:26] <+G_Thunders> Supermassive doesn’t do off screen deaths
[4:11:27] <KaitlynnHere> He probably bled out though
[4:11:27] <Dunmarkh> THERE WAS A SQUELCHING NOISE
[4:11:28] <Zaphire_Saucypants> I mean...there IS one possibility...
[4:11:29] <ThereIsNoJustice> Merwin is alive and will go on to bother more women
[4:11:29] <KLouDraws> he strangely wasnt shown? even tho there was a futuresight to his visual death
[4:11:29] <Dehlome> is copium TOS?
[4:11:29] <+alternative_flu> if they take a nuclear blast to their entire body doesn't matter we gotta see that corpse
[4:11:29] <%ssjklyco> Basicaly a Yakuza character
[4:11:30] <$thefunkiestpunkiest> But the guy with the big ears and the bad haircut said he died!
[4:11:30] <+eggmilk__> if they'e not a candle, they're probably done-zo
[4:11:31] <+Mekhet09> You made the wrong choice.
[4:11:32] <RyuuAoi> I mean there are death screams. Like blood curdling and that was pretty bad
[4:11:33] <$Sphincter_Spelunker> gonna OD on that
[4:11:33] <NireFuster> We literally heard the vampire eat his stomach though
[4:11:35] <KaitlynnHere> In you eyes??
[4:11:36] <BlueBiscuitGT> But can you tell if he's black or not?
[4:11:37] <$evermoore_hex> merwin lives? PogChamp
[4:11:40] <DrunkenDice> ???
[4:11:42] <AngryAsian5> @SoFarFetched Well done Kappa Kappa Kappa

[4:11:48] <KaseKaizer> sarueiCopium sarueiCopium sarueiCopium
[4:11:49] <DashXero> Maybe he's eating the vampire.
[4:11:49] <%DrBunni> He could also have bitten the vampire
[4:11:50] <+Mekhet09> @evermoore_hex he can.
[4:11:50] <RedaiRmex> Oh just to flex on the creatures
[4:11:50] <HaroldDonchee> he was half dead before a monstrum punched him
[4:11:52] <DancesWitBalrog> @bluebiscuitgt she doesn't see color
[4:11:52] <%Ranryu692> @PeachSaliva Steve Buscemi recreated his "how do you do fellow kids" outfit for Halloween
[4:12:01] <Zaphire_Saucypants> @Jaller101514 You'd be surprised.
[4:12:02] <LoliKappa> he shot ropes at the vampire in self-defense
[4:12:11] <%Ranryu692> it
[4:12:18] <%Ranryu692> there are pictures on Twitter
[4:12:22] <+NWR_James> He is SUPER dead
[4:12:22] <DXLelouch24> @PeachSaliva Merwin was half dead anyways. Hes fucked regardless
[4:12:24] <%KeiganOfAstora> he won twitter
[4:12:26] <CappuccinoGuil> Didn't see it, don't count
[4:12:28] <$Sphincter_Spelunker> yeah cuz he's totally walking on his own
[4:12:29] <VentWilsn> shot ropes?
[4:12:29] <+Dirty_Dandere> What if he's fucking that Vampire????
[4:12:29] <RetroCop87> he is a guy, therefore paige did not kill him
[4:12:30] <CrowbarFacelift> How do you do fellow trick or treaters?
[4:12:32] <%Ranryu692> he's hanging out in front of his stoop handing out halloween candy
[4:12:33] <TheHeroAppears> I can't see you you can't see me
[4:12:34] <akitanito> is paige a vampire too
[4:12:35] <turboyabo> that was the vampire getting shot
[4:12:36] <+NWR_James> 12,000% dead
[4:12:43] <Latija> maybe the vampires just want a friend
[4:12:43] <HaroldDonchee> if he's still alive I'll gift 500 subs
[4:12:44] <+SWFanatic> Zangief stream
[4:12:45] <+RAWPowerStudios> Maybe if he turns into a vampire then it doesn't count as a death.
[4:12:56] <RetroCop87> @PeachSaliva did you hear that the Guardians of the Galaxy game is actually pretty good?
[4:12:57] <akitanito> ignored

[4:14:14] <tanarath> @anceldelambert It was better immediately

[4:15:09] <Aiutare47> yes
[4:15:09] <%ssjklyco> It's a metaphor for marriage
[4:15:12] <Monkeyweed21> The flare was going to attract the general
[4:15:13] <EynoStiles> cause both of them would die
[4:15:14] <%BogBodyPositive> to save himself
[4:15:14] <AngryAsian5> Save his ass
[4:15:15] <%Faustgesicht> He would've lost footing and fall
[4:15:15] <CappuccinoGuil> It's LITERALLY climbing protocol
[4:15:15] <%JoshManVGH> He would die if he didn't cut it
[4:15:16] <tjkillemup2> he coudln't pull her up
[4:15:16] <$Sphincter_Spelunker> heyo
[4:15:17] <%AncelDeLambert> I'm telling you, symbolic letting go of their marriage
[4:15:17] <Zaphire_Saucypants> You decided to cut it. You actually get presented that choice twice.
[4:15:17] <akitanito> because the guy was coming closer
[4:15:19] <CrowbarFacelift> the 'ol ball and chain
[4:15:19] <%tempestzephyr> he would've been pulled off the cliff

[4:17:34] <bevyrage> if you don't cut the rope then she still falls because the rope snaps on its own. this outcome does not change between which version you attempt

[4:31:31] <+EyeFarted> Pig and dog? Kinky...
[4:31:34] <LoliKappa> Lamashtu also worked for the CIA
[4:31:35] <%JoshManVGH> What Paige sees when looking at other women in video games.
[4:31:36] <leinadtonu> she also played smash bros melee
[4:31:37] <DXLelouch24> so multiple monster types great
[4:31:38] <HaroldDonchee> she plays dnd?
[4:31:40] <%Puhff> Lamashtu is also in Pathfinder as the Goddess of Monsters
[4:31:40] <Latija> Anu?
[4:31:43] <Aussie_Manny> So its weakness is BREAST-FEEDING! :O
[4:31:47] <+Anime_Flux> Now roll for initiative...
[4:31:48] <neroforte177> the big bads a woman paige you were born for this
[4:31:58] <+G_Thunders> Man these biocurse demon vampires are just too powerful
[4:32:13] <DSD24> Isn't that the Gordion Knot?
[4:32:19] <%g0atmeal> contradictory and consistent
[4:32:21] <LLCoolZJ> cut the horns
[4:32:22] <%cooldude69xx> Sounds like a Paige stream
[4:32:23] <+SWFanatic> Zangief: Fallible & Supreme
[4:32:33] <Uselesswhitenoise> Old gods were so much coler
[4:32:35] <+pectusumbra> @DSD24 that's a complicated problem with a simple solution
[4:32:36] <Uselesswhitenoise> we should bring them back
[4:32:39] <LLCoolZJ> fanny dooly
[4:32:41] <Zaphire_Saucypants> ...
[4:32:45] <Mister_McDerp> yeah Mesopotamian gods were even more dickish than Greek gods
[4:32:48] <Mattais88> All powerful pricks
[4:32:48] <EynoStiles> thats a clue. you will have to make tough choices
[4:32:52] <DSD24> @pectusumbra Ah my mistake
[4:32:53] <%JoshManVGH> "Infectios" slaiva!!
[4:32:59] <+BIumen> it's gonna be the until dawn thing where the monsters are the "miners"
[4:33:03] <Prevot> they said before they hibernate
[4:33:06] <+G_Thunders> Vampires are immortal though?
[4:33:07] <Pt_Kamen> Hibernation
[4:33:07] <Aussie_Manny> I assume the WW2 archaeologists are the vampires.
[4:33:08] <%bassoontyphoon> Vampires are immortal though
[4:33:11] <$Sphincter_Spelunker> just don't die 4Head
[4:33:14] <Zaphire_Saucypants> They hibernate
[4:33:14] <%g0atmeal> it would be cool to see someone turn imo
[4:33:23] <%AncelDeLambert> it's a Graboid
[4:33:31] <+Logoth_> GRENADE
[4:33:33] <%g0atmeal> he almost tripped! that would have been embarassing
[4:33:35] <rosemon5001> so does that mean if peaches saliva touches us we turn into the blind?
[4:33:38] <akitanito> should have made a double trap
[4:33:40] <Dehlome> lmao just walk directly into it
[4:33:40] <+Cafftac> I had to dip right after the guy almost got suffocated by Nick; what'd I miss?
[4:33:47] <@commanderclaw> I love how the tripwire is one of the oldest fucking traps but it still works
[4:33:49] <Aussie_Manny> These fucking lights.
[4:33:55] <$Sphincter_Spelunker> @Cafftac he's dead
[4:33:56] <Baljhet> the trap just pulled the pin, so...don't apply pressure and you're good
[4:33:58] <%tempestzephyr> they're manding..i mean...wendigos
[4:34:07] <%JoshManVGH> @g_thunders Might be a remix. They could be super long loved like Wendigos on Until Dawn, but get weaker without food.
[4:34:12] <HaroldDonchee> dropkick is a cool callsign
[4:34:15] <%Puhff> One of the theories as to why Christianity took off and became huge is that the Christian God is a nice person compared to the cruel and petty Pagan Gods who were basically just assholes with super powers.
[4:34:17] <CappuccinoGuil> @Cafftac Merwin got killed, Rachel was dropped in a hole, Eric knows she was cheating on him.
[4:34:22] <akitanito> is he called dropkick because of his peg leg
[4:34:24] <Aussie_Manny> "Dear Pesky Americans..."
[4:34:30] <+Dirtiest_Bag> you think Dar teamed up with the vampires tho?
[4:34:36] <+Cafftac> @cappuccinoguil OH DAMN
[4:34:47] <%Drewcromwell79> so is this vampires or not?
[4:34:48] <vonmaultke> his girlfriend that was that guys wife
[4:34:49] <LLCoolZJ> Dar would ride the vampires and shoot from their back
[4:35:02] <+Dirtiest_Bag> "but dar this would surely ruin our offensive?"
[4:35:08] <+DatAsuna> van houten
[4:35:11] <Zaphire_Saucypants> back?
[4:35:13] <pillowwasp> Dar is very strong
[4:35:14] <NireFuster> Hanhannan

[4:49:47] <Monkeyweed21> this isnt a 10/10 but its such a quantum leap from Little Hope that it feels like a 10
[4:49:48] <CrowbarFacelift> respect women, gief

[4:56:32] <JhinBappo> @PeachSaliva How are you guys enjoying the game so far?
[4:56:33] <+Artumoc> @dellakitty no one...yet

[4:56:53] <Melchior_the_Wise> I though stream was over
[4:56:59] <Chumblago13> how goes the adventure so far?
[4:57:00] <HaroldDonchee> usually those show the bad end part
[4:57:10] <Aussie_Manny> Joey is fuckin' dead, nah.
[4:57:12] <$Sphincter_Spelunker> Jason knows Salim spared, if he remembered what he looks like
[4:57:13] <+polothegreatest> Shoot first ask later
[4:57:15] <Aussie_Manny> Or, like, undead.
[4:57:15] <Sitromxe> Spooky hole looks like a trap.
[4:57:17] <akitanito> damnit pat
[4:57:18] <MyNameIsRasus> @HaroldDonchee they showed the vampire burning though
[4:57:20] <NireFuster> Lil' baby throwing tantrums
[4:57:20] <CrowbarFacelift> Yeah wouldn't a mimic actually be like "Please help"
[4:57:21] <Dunmarkh> lmao
[4:57:23] <OvaltineDream> funnel
[4:57:29] <lotharrio> Paige immediately imagines that there's a bunch of boys fighting over one boy. How suprising. Kappa
[4:57:29] <%AncelDeLambert> that blood coming out of his nose looked nasty, I dunno
[4:57:35] <Aussie_Manny> No way, surely that was the captain.
[4:57:40] <+Anime_Flux> bird bag

[4:57:59] <Aussie_Manny> "I'm Medy, the medical bag! Har har har!'
[4:58:02] <%AncelDeLambert> now, the real question of the night. Vampires of the game: natural or supernatural?
[4:58:04] <SixthShinx> He was a master of unhurting
[4:58:05] <akitanito> oh this is good after all, oh no
[4:58:14] <Prevot> @AncelDeLambert yes
[4:58:14] <Spydurman> not Joey from Friends!
[4:58:15] <MyNameIsRasus> @AncelDeLambert i'm betting natural
[4:58:17] <Melchior_the_Wise> Paige's penis too huge
[4:58:19] <twistedj3ster> this is what happens when you encourage him
[4:58:20] <Aussie_Manny> "I'M A GENIUS!" ... "OH NO!"

[4:58:38] <+KingKrampus> @melchior_the_wise Paige confirmed for Lady Hyena
[4:58:41] <%AncelDeLambert> cuz it's whether or not Joey IS walking around. If he's a thrall, they'd HAVE to be supernatural
[4:58:41] <+Anime_Flux> Slow and tight, eh?
[4:58:42] <ohno778> BARS
[4:58:43] <DancesWitBalrog> do they have trouble breathing?

[4:59:57] <Mythematical> @ReallyBigRocks congratulations
[4:59:58] <lotharrio> My experience with retrievers is that they are constantly making noises like, "Ruh, ruh, ruh, ruh, ruuuuh."
[4:59:58] <vonmaultke> attract the native boys with blood and explosions
[5:00:01] <Sitromxe> What a bloody madman. Throwing frags around in a slowly collapsing cavern.
[5:00:04] <@commanderclaw> Paige is very good at killing
[5:00:06] <%g0atmeal> they would be deaf
[5:00:08] <HaroldDonchee> mailman is pretty lame compared to divekick

[5:00:14] <Aussie_Manny> Zangief doesn't like this situation. It's FUBAR.
[5:00:16] <+realm_forge> They call him Nicky 2 feet cuz if his funny nose
[5:00:18] <+KINGBAST4RD> how many women has Paige killed with malicious intent so far?
[5:00:21] <+Anime_Flux> you are literally where the sun don't shine

[5:00:28] <%Drewcromwell79> it's that one cod blops scene where you shoot that guy's arm
[5:00:31] <+kewlmyc> @KINGBAST4RD Tonight, one so far.
[5:00:33] <lotharrio> Doing better than Johnny 1 foot.
[5:00:33] <$thefunkiestpunkiest> Why are they here again?
[5:00:34] <Prevot> man these tunnels are claustrophobic
[5:00:37] <NireFuster> Did Paige turn around at the beginning of the tunnel and go ''okay that's where I came from''???
[5:00:38] <Zaphire_Saucypants> Paige has TRIED to kill one woman so far.
[5:00:38] <Dr_Mooose> no sun, only gun
[5:00:39] <%Sotetsu> Caves are spooky enough without monsters in them
[5:00:45] <+KINGBAST4RD> that's pretty damn good for her actually

[5:10:06] <+shootbang_exe> sub par writing
[5:10:06] <%Drewcromwell79> because it's a supermassive game
[5:10:07] <+jinking79> Just following Orders Orders Orders
[5:10:08] <dantea1994> cus nick is an ass
[5:10:08] <Baljhet> nick didn't like him that much, I guess
[5:10:08] <%s_xylocalsingles> cause theyre American, stealing things from foreign countries is their instinct
[5:10:08] <Meltgar> Writting
[5:10:08] <Piemono> Cause bad writing
[5:10:09] <frequenchy> you didnt shoot the shepard, and salim is still an enemy combatant
[5:10:09] <Dehlome> fuck nick
[5:10:09] <stevenellis386> depends on your choices
[5:10:09] <generalve> "Research"
[5:10:09] <Sitromxe> Chain of command?
[5:10:10] <+CptBritches> Because writer bad
[5:10:10] <%AncelDeLambert> when was Nick supposed to die that they needed to remove him from that plot point?
[5:10:10] <zerointelligence000> Nick's an ass?
[5:10:10] <Gorgs7> Proof, and nick is a bitch, that's why
[5:10:10] <$RealThiele> trophy, and nicks a coward
[5:10:10] <Daxalog> Nick said what he could be hes not th eleader
[5:10:10] <+sjay662> Nick tied Salim up
[5:10:11] <+Ches_Neckbeard> because Nick is a shitty american
[5:10:11] <%Sadira_snack_attack> bad writing?
[5:10:11] <%CappuccinoGuil> @PeachSaliva because bad writing
[5:10:11] <The_Murray_Carp> hes probs outranked
[5:10:12] <Wanhangidyilinya> chain of comand
[5:10:12] <+MackFighters> He was following orders, they're his superior officers
[5:10:12] <RedaiRmex> i dont think he tied him up like they said to
[5:10:13] <+ReallyBigRocks> Nick is the one who cuffed him
[5:10:13] <%JoshManVGH> Following Orders or some shit
[5:10:13] <HeroToxiko> YEEEHAW
[5:10:14] <+polothegreatest> WMD of course
[5:10:14] <+Local16> shoulda told him to hide
[5:10:15] <Zaphire_Saucypants> taking the corpse cuz science research.
[5:10:15] <+furiousfurioso> because Dar just shot at them, and he said they have to talk about him
[5:10:15] <+Dirty_Dandere> CHAIN OF COMMAND
[5:10:16] <$cgreene64> science and bad writing
[5:10:16] <+RyanTheRecluse> because orders?

[5:10:17] <%tempestzephyr> yeah like that's dumb
[5:10:18] <Mister_McDerp> to prove it probably
[5:10:18] <bob900000> ploy reasons

[5:10:18] <+CptBritches> Because writing go bad
[5:10:18] <%linSP> coc
[5:10:20] <Pretqu> He did do something, he tied him up
[5:10:20] <+kungfauxboi> the other dont know wtf happened and they are in a shitty situation
[5:10:20] <%Sotetsu> Maybe the scene went weird because Eric is still alve
[5:10:21] <Monkeyweed21> @PeachSaliva Nick is the lowest rank guy there he has to obey orders from Eric
[5:10:21] <$Xevtes> shitty writing
[5:10:22] <+Dirtiest_Bag> scene designed for online c-op contrivances gang
[5:10:23] <%AncelDeLambert> Maybe Nick could die while fighting the vampire?
[5:10:24] <+Kyma1020> Chain of Command
[5:10:24] <DuoScratch> Nick's a limp dick prick
[5:10:24] <HalloweenHangover> Writing calls for it.
[5:10:24] <%Agami23> both jason and nick were on good terms with salim. there was no reason for that shit
[5:10:24] <%justicecadet> they still think their are more soldiers down there
[5:10:25] <lotharrio> Not dead yet. Got it.
[5:10:25] <Zaphire_Saucypants> He was ordered to
[5:10:26] <+sjay662> yep
[5:10:26] <lildaddybree99> good night
[5:10:26] <+payatanharkonnen> !uptime
[5:10:27] <turboyabo> they think they can do test on the monster
[5:10:27] <bob900000> plot reasons
[5:10:28] <%justicecadet> more enemy soldiers
[5:10:28] <HeroToxiko> He cuffed them so they wouldn't shoot him on sight i guess
[5:10:28] <The_Murray_Carp> he did say something
[5:10:29] <+Emperor_Machinus> cause Nick sucks
[5:10:29] <tank7013> @PeachSaliva During the part you guys looked away there was some weird dude in a suit in the background
[5:10:33] <Melchior_the_Wise> guess you guys never heard of military rank structure
[5:10:34] <generalve> @peachsaliva because Eric is Nick supior officer
[5:10:34] <RedaiRmex> i dont think he actually tied him.
[5:10:35] <%GaiaGreen> I mean he's also talking to his two direct superior officers so like
[5:10:43] <NeoCre> He’s an enemy combatant and they just got shot at
[5:10:46] <%justicecadet> he's tied up
[5:10:47] <%GaiaGreen> They could literally just pull rank on him and shut him up
[5:10:48] <RedaiRmex> @tank7013 its the "storyteller"
[5:10:56] <%Kevlar_Caviar> @PeachSaliva you missed the curator standing in the background like a creep earlier
[5:10:58] <lotharrio> Nick DID do something. He arrested that terror-eastern person.
[5:10:59] <+Ches_Neckbeard> WHERE ARE THE WMD'S!?
[5:11:02] <HaroldDonchee> thats polite tho
[5:11:03] <WzillNJ> I feel like rank goes out the window when you're dealing with vampires
[5:11:04] <+SWFanatic> how can he take the water if hes tied up
[5:11:09] <%Piemen99> HIS HANDS ARE TIED
[5:11:09] <PartyFavors> yeah it's a military hierarchy thing, it was the way to not get him shot. I think.
[5:11:11] <+CaptainJax> WHERES SADDAM
[5:11:11] <HeroToxiko> @WzillNJ nope LUL
[5:11:14] <%justicecadet> but nick should have said something earlier... weird writing moment
[5:11:17] <+Mekhet09> This writting just nose dipped.
[5:11:20] <missingangle> Military ranks, guys. Geez, chat sure just loves throwing out "Bad writing" as an excuse LUL
[5:11:24] <tank7013> @RedaiRmex That was my guess but I didn't wanna assume
[5:11:24] <$RealThiele> Saddam made an alliance with vampires you are screwed
[5:11:26] <stevenellis386> is this the playthrough where eric is the hero?
[5:11:26] <Melchior_the_Wise> Nick is a Sgt, and Jason is a Lieutentant and Nick is a Col. you basically you do what they say
[5:11:29] <+payatanharkonnen> This is painting soldiers like maroons
[5:11:30] <HeroToxiko> Inshalah
[5:11:34] <+shootbang_exe> eric is actually garbage when you aren't controlling him jesus
[5:11:35] <%KINGBAST4RD> "Salim, hypothetically, vamps vs wendigos?"
[5:11:38] <Aussie_Manny> I got my higher power right here. xzeroGun
[5:11:43] <Treasure_Vault> BROTHER
[5:11:44] <CatmanIX> how is this game better than little hope exactly? concept is more interesting I guess but writing and directing is just as garbage as ever
[5:11:45] <Dunmarkh> CHAIR FORCE
[5:11:50] <+polothegreatest> WHO MADE THIS? doodCrazy
[5:11:52] <%JoshManVGH> Fucking bitching vampire
[5:11:54] <frequenchy> CHAIR FORCE
[5:11:54] <+EyeFarted> eww, air force
[5:11:55] <Kenny_Riot> @Melchior_the_Wise Guess so. I've never seen this and I watched two different playthroughs already
[5:11:56] <$RealThiele> oh hes air force that explains all the extra racism
[5:11:57] <+terry_quest> is pat also playing?
[5:12:00] <%linSP> something SUS
[5:12:01] <HeroToxiko> @catit's not "all a dream"
[5:12:02] <Baljhet> good, leave behind logs for the next guy to find
[5:12:02] <%ssjklyco> Mad King maybe?
[5:12:03] <@JustinianKnight> that boi borkin
[5:12:03] <+CaptainJax> Hypothetically, would the vampires be considered WMDs?
[5:12:06] <NeroInfinite> He's aliens the fuck out of this
[5:12:08] <+G_Thunders> @missingangle no just team up with the enemy combatant and ignore your superiors tho
[5:12:08] <%Piemen99> @terry_quest yes
[5:12:08] <Aussie_Manny> WHY
[5:12:10] <%justicecadet> he's a scientist now
[5:12:10] <NawsCire> this seems like an awful idea
[5:12:11] <NireFuster> Qualified you mean
[5:12:11] <+Logoth_> THIS SOUNDS LIKE A REALLY BAD IDEA
[5:12:12] <Aussie_Manny> WE SHOULD BE GETTING OUT OF HERE
[5:12:13] <roz_en> oops, ALL VAMPIRES
[5:12:13] <+TheBitingIrish> Why is he doing this? Why isn't he sending this higher up?
[5:12:14] <akitanito> but he's not a biologist
[5:12:15] <xxshadowxx416> yes he is
[5:12:16] <Aussie_Manny> WHAT'RE WE GOING/???
[5:12:16] <+shootbang_exe> something is going to go horribly wrong I feel it in my bones
[5:12:16] <OvaltineDream> It's the fun thing to do
[5:12:16] <%Agami23> yeah, airforce makes alot of this make sense
[5:12:20] <+ReallyBigRocks> He Big Brain
[5:12:21] <LoliKappa> inb4 vampire facehuggers
[5:12:23] <generalve> Qualified Paige
[5:12:25] <eduwardovich> Better make extra extra sure that fucker is dead.
[5:12:26] <+ALazo> engineers actually do practical stuff, though
[5:12:26] <$cgreene64> that's not biology
[5:12:26] <MadMischief> Better than Jar Head i guess
[5:12:28] <%AncelDeLambert> Pat, a physicist can't do an autopsy
[5:12:28] <%g0atmeal> how close was he to that???
[5:12:29] <Profmcstevie> If you can make bomb you can dissect (?)
[5:12:29] <@commanderclaw> "You must be this far into med school to autopsy a vampire"
[5:12:30] <+Kyma1020> He's qualified
[5:12:30] <MyNameIsRasus> WHY ARE THEY MAKING BIG NOISES
[5:12:30] <HeroToxiko> engineers take things apart all the time
[5:12:31] <+CaptainJax> breach charge
[5:12:32] <Parapattern> Yeah, bring them all to you
[5:12:32] <Zaphire_Saucypants> He's still the most qualified person there.
[5:12:32] <+AmericanSkidd> i wouldnt do an autopsy of a dog
[5:12:32] <%JoshManVGH> Those skills aren't cross compatible!
[5:12:32] <Melchior_the_Wise> In another playthrough it said he was a physcists
[5:12:32] <+Mekhet09> I haven't turned on the game yet but this writting nose dipped for drama.
[5:12:35] <%AncelDeLambert> it is so INCREDIBLY out of our field
[5:12:36] <+pectusumbra> I feel like that thing is going to come back to life
[5:12:38] <%vVAstrAVv> he made a satelite paige
[5:12:38] <RickyRelucent> Pat, would you let an art major fix your car?
[5:12:39] <+mr_miyagucci> You gotta be mad smart to do nuclear anything, better him than anyone else there
[5:12:43] <%justicecadet> i wish the writers made use of clarice a bit more. she should have done the autopsy
[5:12:45] <HeroToxiko> muffler kidney whats the difference LUL
[5:12:46] <%CappuccinoGuil> @MyNameIsRasus destroying entry points
[5:12:47] <tank7013> This is some Aliens ass Aliens shit right now
[5:12:48] <%tempestzephyr> "unexpected" yeah let's be as vague as possible so the recording is useless
[5:12:50] <%Sadira_snack_attack> if he has a doctorate he has some biology
[5:12:51] <$StaceMcGate> dead
[5:12:51] <+CptBritches> He's the only person there basically even close to qualified
[5:12:54] <Dunmarkh> you killed her
[5:12:54] <Mister_McDerp> holy shit Paige who else would do it, the jarheads?
[5:12:55] <NireFuster> DEAD LUL
[5:12:55] <%Faustgesicht> She Fell in a pit
[5:12:56] <Spydurman> Zangief wants his gun back
[5:12:56] <+MrMcCrabby> physicists and engineers dont know how to do autopsies usually
[5:12:57] <akitanito> rachel is fake dead like Emily
[5:12:57] <NeroInfinite> Paige you don't to be a biologist to cut opena thing and go "this shit ain't right."
[5:12:57] <+Artumoc> having sex with sexy vampires
[5:12:58] <$Sphincter_Spelunker> it's already dead, how bad could he fuck it up
[5:12:58] <+CaptainJax> she fell down a bigass pit
[5:12:59] <DancesWitBalrog> you killed her
[5:12:59] <lotharrio> Yeah but it's just a bullshit monster.
[5:13:00] <MyNameIsRasus> @CappuccinoGuil oh makes sense

[5:13:02] <LLCoolZJ> Rachel is Matt and Jessica
[5:13:03] <thatshoujotoast> Unqualified maybe but it's better to attempt the skill check than nothing
[5:13:04] <+DatAsuna> she's gonna come back infected for sure
[5:13:04] <tank7013> Set up the smart guns guys
[5:13:05] <$RealThiele> she chilling at the end
[5:13:06] <Aussie_Manny> Rachel is ostensibly dead right now.
[5:13:11] <+realm_forge> Non doctors physically can’t perform dissections

[5:13:13] <LLCoolZJ> WHAT ABOUT SALIM
[5:13:15] <LoliKappa> now kiss

[5:13:30] <AngryAsian5> Really, what about Salim? You literally killed one with him. LUL
[5:13:32] <Zaphire_Saucypants> so remember that's there

[5:14:02] <$Xevtes> jason is a super jarhead jackass
[5:14:02] <Sitromxe> Contrary to popular belief the army doesn't consist entirely of minimally instructed grunts. There are plenty who are quite knowledgeable in their respective fields of expertise.
[5:14:05] <slybirdz> KKona ...
[5:14:06] <HaroldDonchee> he is supposed to be ignorant
[5:14:06] <$SiameseSneeze> eat shit
[5:14:07] <LoliKappa> these writers REALLY want to make you hate Jason
[5:14:07] <lotharrio> Watch them climb on the ceilings and avoid the wire.
[5:14:09] <tanarath> Jason: +Courageous -Bigot
[5:14:09] <Piemono> You want him to be better Paige
[5:14:11] <%AncelDeLambert> I swear to fuck if Jason was nowhere near New York and had no family there I'm gonna hamstring him myself

[5:14:43] <Zaphire_Saucypants> Jason is actually surprisingly cool. You just gotta give him the space to develop.
[5:14:49] <CruxAustralis> man Salim is the fucking best

[5:16:19] <Sitromxe> @LoliKappa How terrifying.
[5:16:19] <$RealThiele> it may be dumb but soldiers during the Iraq war had a lot of racist dum dums
[5:16:20] <Piiavc> @LoliKappa so says user "LoliKappa"
[5:16:20] <+KingKrampus> idk @bevyrage it's better written than most movies with plots like this

[5:19:18] <ergulor> those look a bit soggy
[5:19:22] <%Puhff> can I have a fry?
[5:19:23] <lotharrio> Is it because you are secretly a snake person, as I always suspected, Paige?
[5:19:23] <%doomunderthestairs> fries and dawgs are the best combo
[5:19:24] <%walternatorz> is that a pie tin of fries?
[5:19:29] <Dr_Mooose> pass a fry

[5:22:57] <Wynzler> @lotharrio they might as well be barbarians tbh
[5:23:09] <Zaphire_Saucypants> You've missed a few scenes.
[5:23:10] <+r4ndom_villan> a lot tbh
[5:23:12] <Spydurman> couple of weird moments that feel like it's geared towards online play
[5:23:14] <lotharrio> @Wynzler Basically monsters, yeah.
[5:23:15] <$thefunkiestpunkiest> Did I miss the donation readings
[5:23:23] <+realm_forge> Geif gets so desperate for nutrients he tries to suck them out of other local dogs
[5:23:27] <Spydurman> other version I've seen is Salim runs away

[5:23:39] <$thefunkiestpunkiest> Oh never mind
[5:23:42] <Kenny_Riot> Eric being here is ruining shit already
[5:23:42] <%Agami23> there are prompts that can happen at the same time for both players if you play online
[5:23:45] <+Dirtiest_Bag> the way scenes are recontextualized when you skip the multiplayer sequences makes this really weird
[5:23:48] <$Sphincter_Spelunker> I got here late, where are the glasses
[5:23:50] <frequenchy> you trusted the americans to treat salim like he wasnt an enemy combatant
[5:23:55] <NireFuster> Gief desires the food

[5:24:26] <VritraReiRei> @PeachSaliva i just noticed this but did you ever notice the white spot on Gief's Butt looks like a HEART? <3
[5:24:37] <%TimberWulfe> did Paige ever get the giant Home Depot skelly boi?

[5:25:33] <eyeobject> here is my butthole, here is my spout. *poop*
[5:25:33] <akitanito> wait what
[5:25:36] <%heyitsbrian> I guess I always thought the tea spout was where you poured the tea from
[5:25:37] <NeoCre> Keep in mind that Saleem is Iraqi Military, and they JUST got shot at by someone from said military. Makes sense that they tied him up while figuring out what’s going on
[5:25:38] <BoxNavy> EWWWWWWW!!!
[5:25:40] <+MisterAvry> I bet he shits like a grown ass man
[5:26:00] <%Saadi90> Eating and talking about buttholes. What a champion
[5:26:04] <Void_The_Dark> Man points at bird poop
[5:26:14] <VritraReiRei> How did my comment go from being wholesome to bringing up something icky LUL
[5:26:16] <BoxNavy> does pat poops everywhere haw haw
[5:26:17] <+Dirtiest_Bag> guess when you've eaten mold you can really just do anything and keep your appetite

[5:26:30] <+Arek_1> It was the guys poop. He was going for a power move. LUL
[5:26:34] <+c4llmesnuggles> when u want ice cream, but no ice cream
[5:26:34] <%walternatorz> literally.
[5:26:34] <%doomunderthestairs> it can be pretty bad in my area people are too lazy to pick up after their dogoos
[5:26:36] <bob900000> has no one complained to that owner?
[5:26:37] <+Taisuru> "I've eaten loads of buttholes"
[5:26:37] <NireFuster> "watching a bunch of shit" LITERALLY
[5:26:41] <tanarath> Paige, do you ever use chopsticks for chips or fries?
[5:26:55] <HaroldDonchee> ha
[5:26:55] <+realm_forge> Paige has eaten so many farm buttholes
[5:26:55] <%theshillman> rude
[5:26:56] <+Bogart4321> i thought you were gonna say  ate a bunch of butt holes
[5:26:56] <BoxNavy> i barely remember what the donation message was
[5:27:01] <$thefunkiestpunkiest> Maybe the owner says who cares
[5:27:09] <%walternatorz> of course he doesn't give a shit
[5:27:12] <%ssjklyco> The owners not american either, so no one will say anything to him
[5:27:19] <lotharrio> Eating hot dogs and talking about buttholes? Appropriate.
[5:27:22] <+alternative_flu> mood
[5:27:24] <+Ches_Neckbeard> my county has a leash law. all the cops let their dogs run loose.
[5:27:31] <eyeobject> How dare your dog not poop in french!
[5:27:33] <TTouchdown> The owner speaks French so he gets a pass
[5:27:34] <DrunkenDice> not my poop not my problem lacEZ

[5:30:27] <%ColdxRetro> ColdxRetro subscribed at Tier 3. They've subscribed for 7 months! Did you know that "coming soon to DVD and VHS" and Disney films and l Dr.Mindbender and Dr. Sokolov are all voiced by the same person
[5:30:29] <stevenellis386> man fuck retail
[5:30:31] <KodaKobayashi> is your stone wall real?
[5:30:32] <@commanderclaw> I always tip decently at food service places, I feel for those folks
[5:30:35] <+TEANTACLES> protip: don't do call center work either, you'll get ptsd
[5:30:37] <lotharrio> And he's right.
[5:30:40] <Melchior_the_Wise> Could be working in a coal or Salt mine
[5:30:40] <%heyitsbrian> I think everyone should work in food service for a little bit, just to know what it's like
[5:30:43] <%TimberWulfe> I vowed at a young age to NEVER work in food service
[5:30:44] <KodaKobayashi> like, the walls.
[5:30:44] <+LazinAsian> Food service does indeed suck
[5:30:44] <eyeobject> Worked in a prison and it was better than waiting tables
[5:30:47] <Melchior_the_Wise> or in a factory
[5:30:48] <+alternative_flu> I worked at one retail job for almost a decade. It was terrible.
[5:31:02] <eduwardovich> AKA the people that literally make civilization possible
[5:31:04] <NireFuster> My sister works at a call center and some customers made her actually cry, it's crazy
[5:31:04] <%JoshManVGH> Worked retail pharmacy for 6 years and I would take that over waiting tables. Yall saints.
[5:31:05] <%KINGBAST4RD> call centre, cold calling, selling gas and electricity, the ammount of broken people in that place was fucking staggering
[5:31:06] <%Ranryu692> didn't Pat used to work in a call center?
[5:31:15] <KodaKobayashi> oris that a fake stone wall in front of a normal wall?
[5:31:16] <+OniOniOniiii> call center is oof
[5:31:20] <+WeLucklessJacks> Hated working at a call center.
[5:31:21] <Monkeyweed21> food service sucks ass
[5:31:21] <Spydurman> my mom use to do airline customer service, switched to 911 dispatcher and said it was less stressful LUL
[5:31:34] <MyNameIsRasus> CALL CENTERS SUUUUUUCK
[5:31:34] <+TEANTACLES> @KINGBAST4RD the people don't go in broken, but we all come out broken
[5:31:36] <+Anime_Flux> Basically avoid interacting with people as much as possible. People are the worst.
[5:31:37] <Monkeyweed21> Data entry is also a terrible job
[5:31:44] <$RealThiele> call center complaint lines is like 8 hours of non-stop karens
[5:31:52] <stevenellis386> I thank the lord I never worked in a call centre

[5:32:08] <%Ranryu692> I remember you telling a story about one time they told everyone to go home and shower
[5:32:08] <%tempestzephyr> just lie
[5:32:08] <lotharrio> I worked food service for three years. It got my ass back in gear to get a proper job.
[5:32:10] <+OniOniOniiii> i basically am paid to be yelled at and hear the saddest stories ever
[5:32:10] <%Ell1ot> don't lie, just lie
[5:32:10] <+NotaryRotary> misdirect
[5:32:12] <$thefunkiestpunkiest> Lately Wendy's has been saying their fries are better than McDonald's' fries. Which is a bold faced LIE.
[5:32:13] <generalve> lie
[5:32:14] <+Dirtiest_Bag> that's the most ethical job I've ever heard of

[5:36:20] <eyeobject> Oh no it's Cobra Commander come to eat all our hotdogs!
[5:36:28] <%JoshManVGH> that's a radioactivly red flag
[5:36:30] <lotharrio> But think about the experience!
[5:36:33] <Yuroshi> they weren't going to pay you for waiting?
[5:36:34] <Melchior_the_Wise> idk, 0C isn't as bad as 0F
[5:36:35] <+NiktenKing> when you show up and there is no work
[5:36:38] <$RealThiele> centipede time
[5:36:44] <+InternetShis> Metric is better for measuring, not feeling the air
[5:36:46] <+RelikaNox> I remember having to wait an hour in the freezing snow next to a river cause my boss was late and didn't even let us know he was. And there was nowhere to warm up :(

[5:50:17] <$evermoore_hex> puppy dog is a fucked up thing to call the husband you cheated on
[5:50:17] <%Ell1ot> what's that smell?
[5:50:19] <+realm_forge> This game director definitely played Ravenloft
[5:50:21] <%JoshManVGH> Wouldn't they though?
[5:50:21] <%Sotetsu> R2! Shut off all the trash compactors!
[5:50:22] <+TEANTACLES> so the devs REALLY liked The Descent and Aliens
[5:50:24] <frequenchy> mhmmm tomato souup
[5:50:29] <%strakillias> Put that shit on
[5:50:35] <KaitlynnHere> That’d smell so bad I’d vomit
[5:50:41] <%Kevlar_Caviar> @TEANTACLES i'm getting more The Cave vibes, especially from the vampires' designs
[5:50:47] <DancesWitBalrog> Gascoigne would be high out of his mind in this pool
[5:50:49] <@commanderclaw> It was intended to be that way, they knew it would turn green

[5:50:54] <+EyeFarted> BLIGHTTOWN PART 2

[5:51:00] <miniyuna> reminds me of that one scene in tomb raider
[5:51:01] <KaitlynnHere> No it’s canon
[5:51:03] <+pectusumbra> she's been down here long enough she probably doesn't notice
[5:51:04] <Wynzler> Zach and Cody did it again!
[5:51:05] <eduwardovich> Yeah you'd be puking your guts out
[5:51:05] <LLCoolZJ> Blood is sticky
[5:51:06] <Mirrorcatch> i'd take a selfie for a sick metal album cover in case i survive
[5:51:07] <%Sotetsu> Maybe she got covid and lost her sense of smell.
[5:51:07] <%Ranryu692> weird fact: the Statue of Liberty technically belongs to New Jersey, not New York
[5:51:09] <%SharkMissile> Naw the fire burns away the stink tomatoSmile
[5:51:09] <+TEANTACLES> @TEANTACLES i mean this wading through a cave full of blood scene is LITERALLY from The Descent
[5:51:10] <+megaotter> wouldn't a pool of blood like that just coagulate?
[5:51:10] <%AncelDeLambert> this is not blood.
[5:51:10] <%tempestzephyr> this is the party cave
[5:51:11] <%ocelotshotfirst> Maybe it's not just blood
[5:51:11] <NireFuster> It's TOO much blood
[5:51:14] <%theshillman> you'd throw up so much
[5:51:14] <OvaltineDream> So much people goo
[5:51:15] <KaitlynnHere> Lol
[5:51:15] <+BigCoffee> it"s mixed with water

[5:51:29] <%AncelDeLambert> it's probably a subterrainian iron deposit
[5:51:30] <Mister_McDerp> is it actually blood though?
[5:51:32] <DancesWitBalrog> Did bloodborne have this much blood in one spot?
[5:51:34] <LLCoolZJ> blood and psiss
[5:51:36] <%bassoontyphoon> Did you know they scrub the roofs of parliament hill with pregnant horse urine to make them oxidize faster????
[5:51:37] <ThereIsNoJustice> I think it's a vidya gam
[5:51:37] <NireFuster> Ah shit it's the batman!
[5:51:38] <Aussie_Manny> Yeah, it can't be 100% blood.
[5:51:39] <KaitlynnHere> Unless it’s water and blood

[5:57:54] <DXLelouch24> @PeachSaliva Manchurian Gold
[5:57:54] <lotharrio> @KaitlynnHere I am old... I assume that was a compliment?
[5:57:55] <BlueSpartan119> Manchurian Gold
[5:57:58] <+AdumPlaze> It was better than the other dark pictures games except Until Dawn
[5:57:59] <%bassoontyphoon> But like is the vampire saliva Manchuria gold
[5:58:02] <+AdumPlaze> that's all I'm gonna say
[5:58:27] <KaitlynnHere> @lotharrio I’d meant that 28 weeks later wasn’t as good as 28 days later. So… no?
[5:58:27] <EntropyArcade> the manchurian gold was "expensive sulfur" that made people hallucinate i thinkk??
[5:58:32] <zerointelligence000> what if it was the bus driver?
[5:58:34] <thatdudenamedlogan> Does the Vampire's Bite make you trip out?
[5:58:36] <%tempestzephyr> y'all getting high on vampire cum

[5:58:48] <eyeobject> Vampire farts
[5:58:49] <missingangle> Don't apologize! it's fine!
[5:58:51] <Sikkab> OhMyDog
[5:58:52] <Piemono> I mean it'd be weird if they were all hallucinating the same type of monster
[5:58:53] <+Di0nin> @DatAsuna that cod zombies approach i see
[5:58:54] <+alternative_flu> Is coooooool
[5:58:56] <HeroToxiko> Weren't the wendigos ladies too?
[5:59:02] <+PrimalDweeb> It's all good
[5:59:04] <+Sir_Gawain_Lotsson> Salim is the best character in this game
[5:59:05] <%Sotetsu> It's a tough pill to swallow.
[5:59:08] <%ssjklyco> They were in the trailer when you watched one of the E3 stuff and you guys commented on it at the time.
[5:59:08] <+Nightwolf656> Salim is killin it
[5:59:13] <%bassoontyphoon> The monsters are real but what if they were harvested for their saliva to make spooky gas
[5:59:14] <KaitlynnHere> Just give him a one two
[5:59:16] <%s_xylocalsingles> @HeroToxiko Wendigos were just whoever ate human meat
[5:59:18] <%JoshManVGH> @herotoxiko Wendigos where both
[5:59:19] <+Sir_Gawain_Lotsson> @Nightwolf656 Salim IS killin'
[5:59:20] <%Kevlar_Caviar> nah some of the wendigos were men
[5:59:22] <isa_sensei96> I dipped out for a minute to do a full shave, are they almost finished?
[5:59:24] <KaitlynnHere> I’m kidding
[5:59:24] <lotharrio> @KaitlynnHere Ah, that's fair. I didn't recall a part of 28 Days later where saliva landed in an eye... but I haven't watched either movie for a while.
[5:59:24] <Aussie_Manny> Wendigos were not all women.
[5:59:26] <NireFuster> Remember that the dude also turns into a wendigo at the end
[5:59:29] <zerointelligence000> no the wendigos were if you comitted cannibalism
[5:59:32] <+Caidezes> This is just The Descent.
[5:59:33] <HeroToxiko> okay thanks chat
[5:59:33] <NireFuster> The one that brought you all into the cabin
[5:59:34] <+silvery_cricket> WHAT THAT SMELL!?
[5:59:34] <Mister_McDerp> might be spit
[5:59:36] <%Sotetsu> Is it okay to never cut your cat's nails? Or can that be bad for them?
[5:59:37] <Coystick> Bloody water
[5:59:37] <%Kevlar_Caviar> most of the wendigos were men actually
[5:59:37] <%Drewcromwell79> Unless it was all a dream
[5:59:39] <idyota> it's viscera
[5:59:40] <Aussie_Manny> IT'S BLOOOOOD
[5:59:41] <+Di0nin> Just put up a wall between gief and the food, he struggles hard with zoning
[5:59:42] <friedsquidiot> It’s probably blood and water
[5:59:45] <eduwardovich> @HeroToxiko Also there are different variations on wendigo legends.
[5:59:46] <+KingKrampus> this is some Resident Evil Village levels of blood
[5:59:47] <+Sir_Gawain_Lotsson> Vargheist
[5:59:52] <Piiavc> Super Massive seem to need a monster that is skinny and has teeth
[5:59:54] <NeoCre> Blood, poo, water, pee
[5:59:55] <Zeif00> Watch out Ashley Tisdale D:
[5:59:57] <ohno778> Somebody played tomb rader
[5:59:58] <+ReallyBigRocks> flammable bones
[6:00:03] <+pectusumbra> yeah they do that
[6:00:03] <%heyitsbrian> so it's not all blood
[6:00:05] <Aussie_Manny> Fire is loud.
[6:00:05] <%ssjklyco> There is a fungus that turns red and is same smell of blood when it turns.
[6:00:05] <%Sotetsu> That one looks sassy
[6:00:05] <%Agami23> its blood because it was cool in the movie "the descent"
[6:00:08] <SpellCatty> Is the blood not splashing at all
[6:00:10] <KaitlynnHere> @lotharrio no that happens in 28 days later, I think it came from a crow chewing on an eyeball or something
[6:00:14] <%Ell1ot> bones are hot
[6:00:15] <%AncelDeLambert> when covered in tar? Yes.
[6:00:16] <+Logoth_> Flammable means INFLAMMABLE? What a country!
[6:00:17] <eyeobject> Because skeletons are hot
[6:00:17] <%walternatorz> hard to move through water on all fours?
[6:00:18] <eduwardovich> The old Last Crusade
[6:00:18] <LLCoolZJ> bone burning juice
[6:00:21] <+shootbang_exe> wuh
[6:00:21] <Jetsfantasy> It's the stench of decay burning I guess
[6:00:22] <+CaptainJax> bones are NOT flammable
[6:00:23] <%optimasmaximas> um
[6:00:24] <KaitlynnHere> @lotharrio but it doesn’t really matter
[6:00:24] <%AncelDeLambert> ... WUT

[6:00:37] <+pectusumbra> ummmm
[6:00:37] <%THATGUY_789> I wonder if it's red algae
[6:00:39] <+Emperor_Machinus> Could it be oil?
[6:00:42] <%heyitsbrian> it won't HUNT women
[6:00:43] <fuji_n2> she got turned

[6:02:28] <+Anime_Flux> Eric, you bumbling oaf
[6:02:30] <lotharrio> @KaitlynnHere I guess I was confusing it for the sequel... where one character had a passive immunity, but they didn't pass that onto any of their family. Then they passed on the virus to  their... husband, and that got everything out of control.
[6:02:39] <%KINGBAST4RD> Wendigos still cooler
[6:02:41] <HeroToxiko> Wait a minute We had camera phones in 2003, they were just really shitty

[6:05:13] <Dunmarkh> He's be the cleric
[6:05:14] <+Di0nin> Eric is definitely a paladin's name

[6:05:15] <+justianxix> thta doesn't sound good

[6:05:42] <ohno778> that's a party down there
[6:05:43] <eyeobject> It's bluuuuuuud

[6:19:43] <+JavaManJoJo> I don't understand how these same people made Little Hope, lol
[6:19:45] <%optimasmaximas> thats GREAT to hear
[6:19:50] <%optimasmaximas> this was great so far
[6:19:51] <+Taisuru> Good to hear
[6:19:51] <AngryAsian5> This was re
[6:19:55] <critiquequartz> Third act goes places
[6:19:58] <critiquequartz> It’s good
[6:19:59] <NireFuster> SOOOO much better
[6:20:00] <+realm_forge> Damn zangeif is fuckin jacked
[6:20:01] <Dunmarkh> @JhinBappo It fucking nukes little hope
[6:20:02] <%AncelDeLambert> better
[6:20:02] <AngryAsian5> this was really fun
[6:20:09] <HeroToxiko> at a certain angle, gief looks like pat is a crouching satyr
[6:20:10] <Monkeyweed21> god i hope Salim does okaY
[6:20:12] <+RenoDeGeneric> And the threats are REAL
[6:20:14] <+Nightwolf656> Try not to get Spoiled online this week.
[6:20:14] <eyeobject> also many bones and blood
[6:20:16] <+silvery_cricket> Little Hope felt rushed out the door
[6:20:19] <+RustyCoyoteA> It has great pacing
[6:20:19] <blue8moon> I think this suffers from the way they're doing co-op
[6:20:24] <+Arek_1> KKona
[6:20:25] <NireFuster> It's a genuinely great game
[6:20:26] <NateyBeak> Salim is the main character
[6:20:27] <bob900000> I wonder who the director of the next game will be?
[6:20:29] <%AncelDeLambert> I give a shit, there's characters I actively like, the two I hate are MEANT to be hated, and the rest are at least interesting
[6:20:32] <NireFuster> Characters are archetypes but they're good
[6:20:40] <mattynezz> Baby is tired and cranky
[6:20:45] <+TEANTACLES> shush the pat
[6:20:47] <Uselesswhitenoise> slap the paige
[6:20:48] <+Taisuru> It okay
[6:20:49] <%Sotetsu> Rub his belly.
[6:20:49] <eyeobject> take a mental nap
[6:20:52] <JhinBappo> I love you guys so much.
[6:20:52] <NireFuster> LUL
[6:20:57] <%Ranryu692> haha we saw Paige's rug earlier
[6:21:07] <+realm_forge> Pat needs his binky
[6:21:17] <$Sphincter_Spelunker> phrasing
[6:21:19] <%optimasmaximas> LUL

[6:21:27] <%Sotetsu> You guys are great. And so is your rug.
[6:21:30] <Wynzler> OH okay

[6:21:32] <%BinaryFireball> whats wrong with the rug anyways?
[6:21:33] <%heyitsbrian> was going to say lol
[6:21:34] <$Sphincter_Spelunker> it's on the subreddit
[6:21:35] <+Bogart4321> ResidentSleeper ResidentSleeper ResidentSleeper
[6:21:38] <+EyeFarted> WHEN'S HOUSE TOUR?
[6:21:42] <%JoshManVGH> This much talked about and very emotional run
[6:21:44] <Dr_Mooose> rug exposed
[6:21:45] <+SWFanatic> Paige > Door
[6:21:46] <%JoshManVGH> rug
[6:21:50] <+PrimalDweeb> No more breaking doors Paige!
[6:21:57] <@SoFarFetched> Only Pat can see your rug geefPlz
[6:21:58] <%Sotetsu> Be proud of your ugly rug!
[6:21:59] <$StaceMcGate> please call it anything besides Rug lol
[6:21:59] <Dementedpenguin> >_>
[6:22:00] <$Sphincter_Spelunker> make more sound clips
[6:22:05] <+DatAsuna> and you wonder why people think peachsaliva is a porn thing
[6:22:10] <+SWFanatic> those doors had it comin
[6:22:10] <%TheWinged7> your fucking rug? why tall boning on the floor paige? Kappa
[6:22:13] <tanarath> Paige, it's fine
[6:22:13] <twistedj3ster> too strong for doors
[6:22:14] <+Mr_Pylon> those new doors better watch out
[6:22:20] <+PrimalDweeb> Do your best.
[6:22:21] <JhinBappo> Funny enough, another streamer I follow also occasionally breaks doors.
[6:22:23] <Prevot> sliding door suck ass
[6:22:24] <bob900000> not even guests?
[6:22:25] <mattynezz> They don't
[6:22:27] <+PrimalDweeb> LUL
[6:22:33] <$Sphincter_Spelunker> I ran into a sliding door twice in my life
[6:22:38] <$Sphincter_Spelunker> did not break
[6:22:39] <%JoshManVGH> I imagine Peach entering rooms like the Kool Aid Man
[6:22:45] <%Ranryu692> they break more easily than hinged doors, but "very easily" is inaccurate
[6:22:45] <Cobaltor_252> I keep doors wide open when I'm home alone
[6:22:47] <+realm_forge> Paige will destroy whole buildings but god HELP you if you fuck with the rug
[6:22:51] <+SWFanatic> Not enough asses
[6:23:23] <DracaenaLeaf> doggo

[6:24:30] <+realm_forge> Zangeif is locked, loaded and aimed right at pat
[6:24:31] <%ssjklyco> It sounds like two differnet topics
[6:24:45] <@SoFarFetched> Please dont mind them,they are old
