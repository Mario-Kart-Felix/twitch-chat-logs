[0:16:39] <@Moobot> Hey check out Guardians of the Galaxy here! Thanks! tinyurl.com/2sk6ru2c
[0:16:41] <eyeobject> wah wah wagief
[0:16:57] <twistedj3ster> Omikron was simply mentioned and it bugged the mixer out
[0:17:13] <%zeroarturia> Just so you know these Guardians are based more on the comics so no Ego the living planet
[0:17:13] <+trackles_64> its what Marvel Avengers hould of been
[0:17:13] <TonyBStreaming> The game is based off the comics
[0:17:18] <TonyBStreaming> for the most part at least
[0:17:28] <freelancebabymaker> honestly i almost prefer these guardians to the mcu guardians
[0:17:41] <+cvp5127> oh yea this is the apology game for avengers
[0:17:49] <%trekkie11041> so woolies the main antagonist?
[0:17:52] <%BallerSwagBro9k> @freelancebabymaker Same
[0:17:55] <+emperordread> The Universal Church of Truth? Isn't that Woolie's made up thing from the podcast a few years ago?
[0:18:04] <+trackles_64> Awww
[0:18:05] <$chance_h> Pats Church of Universal Truth psaCrazyhead psaLiz
[0:18:13] <%BallerSwagBro9k> Woolie is indeed the big bad
[0:18:22] <TonyBStreaming> He killed that one guy
[0:18:24] <%zeroarturia> DMCA sucks
[0:18:25] <+trackles_64> THe music is like 60% of the game
[0:18:31] <TonyBStreaming> And we should've paid attention to it
[0:18:34] <$KeiganOfAstora> Time for awkward silences. Copyright free awkward silences @PeachSaliva
[0:18:37] <eduwardovich> The real Woolie was the enemies we made along the way.
[0:18:42] <heartlesshealer> blaring from title to options until you get that streamer mode on
[0:18:54] <TurtlesAndTentacles> I hate streamer mode.
[0:19:07] <%BallerSwagBro9k> Beat it the week it dropped
[0:19:07] <freelancebabymaker> yeah the music thing is the most unfortunate part of the game
[0:19:11] <heartlesshealer> everyone hates that it's needed
[0:19:24] <TurtlesAndTentacles> paige where is the link?
[0:19:25] <%zeroarturia> Is it for just for PC paige?
[0:19:26] <heartlesshealer> but appreciate that they did the work for streamers
[0:19:31] <chai_wolf> Honestly when I watched Pat play it it looked really fun. I don't usually play super hero games but I kinda wanna play this
[0:19:45] <TonyBStreaming> @TurtlesAndTentacles use !guardians in the chat, it should bring it up
[0:19:45] <+trackles_64> @zeroarturia multi platform

[0:20:19] <heartlesshealer> bloodborne is a different type of action game
[0:20:19] <+Uulyaoth> this should be a relaxing game anywya tbh
[0:20:21] <%Spadoinkle> But Sensai, all the lessons.
[0:20:22] <%JoshManVGH> It's OK
[0:20:23] <+trackles_64> Baby pat mode as we call it

[0:21:06] <heartlesshealer> oh right, are subtitles on, or would that distract her from the voices because she'd read?
[0:21:15] <+trackles_64> jammies

[0:24:45] <MaesePC> between 5 and 32
[0:24:48] <Mattais88> Like a lumberjack?
[0:24:50] <SovPho> HE HAS A COUCH IN HIS ROOM
[0:24:51] <%Spadoinkle> I love it. I love her. I also want to where.
[0:24:52] <%king_wragles> In? If those mom jeans were any more mom they'd give birth
[0:24:53] <$zyberion626> the only thing that didn't come back was the hair
[0:24:54] <YakumoYomi> Big 80s hair
[0:24:56] <heartlesshealer> wait he got the eye make up?
[0:24:59] <+trackles_64> That hair tho

[0:25:11] <Spiralpower1620> I wonder of Paige will dig Goatee Rocket
[0:25:14] <+toastybites> NERD
[0:25:14] <eduwardovich> Ancient technology is very strange
[0:25:16] <shieldecho> NEEEEEEEERD
[0:25:19] <TonyBStreaming> LOOK AT THIS 80'S SHIT KID
[0:25:29] <freelancebabymaker> FLAYER?
[0:25:29] <YakumoYomi> A flying V!
[0:25:32] <+TMulharin> FLAAAAAYYYERRRRR
[0:25:32] <%cooldude69xx> What a loser, playing dungeons and dragons before it was cool
[0:25:35] <+valhallandoates> FLAINING BLOOD
[0:25:38] <eyeobject> Would have thought he would play Paladin or Warrior
[0:25:40] <samTUMZfestival> DINGERS
[0:25:50] <samTUMZfestival> YOOO
[0:26:03] <terrantom1990> yoo that book!
[0:26:03] <eduwardovich> I remember seeing ads for that in EGM like 25 years ago. Lol
[0:26:04] <samTUMZfestival> Deathtrap Dungeon
[0:26:06] <+trackles_64> choose your own adventure books were pog
[0:26:06] <heartlesshealer> god old choose your own adventure books
[0:26:10] <YakumoYomi> Actual Deathtrap Dungeon?!
[0:26:10] <Spiralpower1620> that's way more of a pain in the ass
[0:26:12] <$KeiganOfAstora> I hate this type of gameplay. Who realistically walks around their room and comments on random things?
[0:26:14] <TonyBStreaming> I still can't believe that book is real, I thought it was fake when I played
[0:26:22] <eyeobject> Paige, if you played dnd what class would you be?
[0:26:29] <+BlowFireThroatTotem> And now they're just somebody that you used to know
[0:26:29] <terrantom1990> My nostalgia is hitting hard on that, loved that book
[0:26:29] <Spiralpower1620> @keiganofastora yeah.... who does that? BuddhaBar
[0:26:31] <+trackles_64> @KeiganOfAstora i do that all the time wdym
[0:26:35] <TonyBStreaming> There was a trig class in my school that had everyone playing with Rubic's cubes
[0:26:40] <samTUMZfestival> For the skellingtons?
[0:26:42] <$KeiganOfAstora> LUL
[0:26:43] <%notsoy> smfh what answer did y'all expect
[0:26:44] <+trackles_64> its green man
[0:26:45] <shieldecho> barbarian necromancer
[0:26:46] <freelancebabymaker> @KeiganOfAstora its very "for the player"
[0:26:49] <%cade_calrayn> hence why no one will play DND with Paige
[0:26:50] <eduwardovich> Wake up pls
[0:26:53] <$KeiganOfAstora> And as a player I don't care LUL
[0:26:55] <%BallerSwagBro9k> Of course LUL
[0:26:56] <TonyBStreaming> Apparently there's an algorithm you can use to solve any cube
[0:27:02] <eyeobject> You just want to make your own harem of bone boys don't you?
[0:27:05] <Mattais88> I'd like to play a bard some time
[0:27:11] <freelancebabymaker> love this drax design
[0:27:16] <+BlowFireThroatTotem> Drax is pretty sexy in this
[0:27:21] <freelancebabymaker> cool tattoos
[0:27:25] <Spiralpower1620> whatever Bautista
[0:27:30] <+trackles_64> its a good voice for Drax as wekk
[0:27:37] <eduwardovich> Metal AF
[0:27:37] <maskedmook> the voice acting sounds strange to me
[0:27:37] <placeholder03> STREAMING MODE: ON
[0:27:44] <samTUMZfestival> Telltale opening was better....
[0:27:44] <%notsoy> michael jackson-ass jacket lmao
[0:27:49] <freelancebabymaker> crisp rat
[0:27:50] <+TMulharin> Crip Rat
[0:27:51] <TonyBStreaming> Mario?
[0:27:51] <+tempestzephyr> mario man
[0:27:52] <$GarbageNirvana> I like the canon in this game that he took his alias from his favorite band
[0:27:57] <eyeobject> How is Pratt not voicing him?
[0:27:57] <SovPho> Chris Pratt and his ***healthy*** child
[0:28:00] <DraxTD> RIGHT?!
[0:28:01] <MyNameIsRasus> I like that in my country's dub they got the MCU voice actors to repeat their roles
[0:28:01] <+Shaggnar> Mario
[0:28:03] <rustybuckethead21> the future Mario?
[0:28:04] <Mattais88> Dazzler poster
[0:28:05] <Reveresao> I suppose music is supposed to be playing right now
[0:28:08] <AoiRob> but is it on tho
[0:28:10] <+takotoots> Mario pratt
[0:28:12] <TonyBStreaming> The jump guy
[0:28:15] <heartlesshealer> comics version, doesn't have to be pratt
[0:28:22] <TonyBStreaming> FIND THE TRASH PANDA
[0:28:34] <redgraverr> Chris Pratt will voice every one in the near future
[0:28:38] <samTUMZfestival> PAIGE

[0:29:04] <%JimmyRuss> Talk to him with Triangle
[0:29:07] <freelancebabymaker> these designs feel more infromed by the movies
[0:29:07] <Spiralpower1620> iiiiiiiiiiiim hooked on a feeling
[0:29:17] <freelancebabymaker> the avengers design felt like por parodies
[0:29:40] <+trackles_64> Drax is easily the bes tone

[0:30:06] <heartlesshealer> adderall no exist, so dog distraction powerful
[0:30:20] <+BlowFireThroatTotem> Peter Quill used to be a Japanese delinquent
[0:30:21] <%hewlettfan96> It wouldn’t be a Peach stream without technical questions and incompetence lol
[0:30:33] <TonyBStreaming> Where did he get that sweet cut in space?

[0:36:23] <samTUMZfestival> Was that BETA RAY BILL?!
[0:36:35] <Daxalog> If Rocket called you "toots" would you still like him?

[0:37:30] <heartlesshealer> ?
[0:37:34] <$MikeTD81> Yeah turn off controller speaker
[0:37:35] <TonyBStreaming> We can't hear her
[0:37:36] <+BlowFireThroatTotem> What if he called you chopper-face?
[0:37:36] <+Taisuru> BORK
[0:37:38] <heartlesshealer> oh god the controller thing
[0:37:42] <AoiRob> you can turn off the speaker
[0:37:42] <@Moobot> Hey check out Guardians of the Galaxy here! Thanks! tinyurl.com/2sk6ru2c
[0:37:42] <heartlesshealer> I think you can turn that off
[0:37:46] <%MisterRockett> Oh Paige you gotta turn off the controller speaker option.
[0:37:48] <%zeroarturia> @hewlettfan96 Not based on MCU. this is own story
[0:37:50] <%MisterRockett> We can't hear that.
[0:37:51] <+trackles_64> So heroic
[0:37:51] <TonyBStreaming> Controller speakers don't get into the stream
[0:37:55] <samTUMZfestival> They always forget to show him putting his helmet on, I don't know why they always make that continuity error....
[0:38:04] <heartlesshealer> she'll speak normal in the game when you turn it off
[0:38:05] <+trackles_64> the immersion
[0:38:08] <%hewlettfan96> @freelancebabymaker Whaaat? You need to get on that son, they’re honestly worth the hype, endgame isn’t the highest grossing film for no reason
[0:38:15] <TonyBStreaming> Thank you
[0:38:16] <$MikeTD81> YOU DID IT
[0:38:23] <AoiRob> BIG DID IT
[0:38:34] <freelancebabymaker> @hewlettfan96 i like the few i have seen
[0:38:37] <%MisterRockett> I got SUPER confused when I started this game cause I had my controller speaker audio turned all the way down so they just weren't talking and characters were having half conversations with themselves lol.
[0:38:41] <+chiazam> There’s so much dialogue in this game
[0:38:45] <%hewlettfan96> @zeroarturia Hmmm what? Is it an OG story made by completely different writers?
[0:38:47] <samTUMZfestival> Smoke the resin
[0:39:00] <heartlesshealer> detritus is basically debris, yeah
[0:39:05] <freelancebabymaker> @hewlettfan96 original story
[0:39:23] <freelancebabymaker> @hewlettfan96 more based on the comics story wise at least
[0:39:34] <%zeroarturia> @hewlettfan96 Yep these guardians are based on the comics.

[0:40:18] <%hewlettfan96> @freelancebabymaker Ahh okay, canon is messy in MCU anyway considering reboots and multiple universes, which continuities should U generally accept in Marvel or DC
[0:40:19] <+trackles_64> Geef can use technology
[0:40:20] <%BallerSwagBro9k> HES LEARNING
[0:40:23] <eduwardovich> Gief is evolving
[0:40:25] <$shurtal> Gief is just cleaning up after himself
[0:40:26] <%hewlettfan96> What did Gief do??

[1:20:25] <@Moobot> Hey check out Guardians of the Galaxy here! Thanks! tinyurl.com/2sk6ru2c
[1:20:41] <QueequegTheater> Pat had the same problem in God of War, the game is terrified of downtime
[1:21:35] <juan_wu_tamad> star lord sounds like a stoner surfer
[1:21:48] <juan_wu_tamad> ...star lord would be a fitting name for a stoner surfer
[1:22:24] <+doc_ock_rokc> Groot is tougher then hell he is fine
[1:23:07] <$StephanieSadGirl> I love that he doesnt backpedal the 'I love you' or try and cover it or anything

[1:26:15] <ShinBojangles> His ass cheeks would clap too much in there
[1:26:18] <%king_wragles> It's the tutorial?
[1:26:32] <$StephanieSadGirl> @ShinBojangles It would alert the bug guards
[1:26:40] <freelancebabymaker> @eustine its still the very start
[1:26:51] <%king_wragles> passed some nests
[1:26:51] <ShinBojangles> @StephanieSadGirl LUL
[1:26:53] <SovPho> shoot the nest god why
[1:26:56] <eustine> Ah, just got here ty.

[1:27:54] <freelancebabymaker> paige run
[1:28:12] <SovPho> lol
[1:28:17] <%CubicPhantom> dab into infinity peter
[1:28:19] <Daxalog> 👀
[1:28:24] <+doc_ock_rokc> THIS IS VERY linear
[1:28:28] <$StephanieSadGirl> And Star lord fell to his death, clipping through the geometry as he went
[1:28:31] <freelancebabymaker> that was an alternate timeline
[1:28:41] <juan_wu_tamad> see what?  you fall into the abyss?  missed that entirely
[1:29:23] <+FlyingRamen> being linear is kind of what I llke about it.
[1:29:41] <%CubicPhantom> redisual? huh

[1:30:53] <tanarath> Would Paige be a good guardian of that stone?
[1:31:01] <%BallerSwagBro9k> no
[1:31:08] <+ThomasOfTroy> Of course not
[1:31:17] <+doc_ock_rokc> I AM GROOT
[1:31:29] <$StephanieSadGirl> Dear god no, and I say that with all respect
[1:31:47] <%king_wragles> Time?
[1:31:48] <freelancebabymaker> an infinity stone would turn paige into dust
[1:31:48] <%king_wragles> I think
[1:31:51] <%king_wragles> No wait... mind
[1:31:51] <+doc_ock_rokc> soul
[1:31:53] <TimetodiveLTX> bro!
[1:31:53] <freelancebabymaker> or soul?
[1:31:54] <$StephanieSadGirl> Soul
[1:31:54] <Mattais88> Soul
[1:31:57] <tanarath> Mind?
[1:32:02] <lotharrio> It would be Mind I believe?
[1:32:07] <%BallerSwagBro9k> Soul Stone
[1:32:08] <+RAGING_1NF3RNO> Looks like the Soul stone.
[1:32:18] <%king_wragles> Orange and yellow look so similar
[1:32:20] <tanarath> A, there are a few
[1:32:21] <+toastybites> Paige would eat an infinity stone and find out a week later
[1:32:22] <%BallerSwagBro9k> Soul is orange Mind is Yellow
[1:32:23] <$StephanieSadGirl> Could be soul or mind, both are a very similar color
[1:32:28] <+MooseIsGoose> there are some cool outfits
[1:32:28] <phantalime> Paige please don't eat the infinity stone
[1:32:35] <tanarath> So mind.
[1:32:38] <freelancebabymaker> infinity sand
[1:32:39] <SovPho> paige please DO eat the infinity stone
[1:32:40] <+doc_ock_rokc> HONESTLY the color changes on the stones constantly
[1:32:41] <%king_wragles> We know it's not Time... that's green
[1:32:46] <$StephanieSadGirl> Paige! Paige!  The infinty stone is the color of mustard, it might taste like mustard!  Eat it!
[1:32:52] <mr_saturday93> it's soul
[1:32:53] <%king_wragles> Reality is red, power is purple
[1:33:02] <+MooseIsGoose> And they give the info on their appearance
[1:33:05] <%king_wragles> I think it is soul, ya
[1:33:08] <Mattais88> Space is blue
[1:33:13] <TimetodiveLTX> it probably tastes like corn, i wouldn't eat it
[1:33:19] <tanarath> Infinninniy
[1:33:25] <lotharrio> In the MCU? You'd die. None of them are safe to handle directly.
[1:33:26] <$StephanieSadGirl> It COULD taste like mustard flavored hurty sand tho!
[1:33:27] <+doc_ock_rokc> Power used to be Yellow once
[1:33:36] <freelancebabymaker> the costumes in this are cool because they cite the issues they all come from
[1:33:45] <%BallerSwagBro9k> PAIGE NO! NO EATING TableHere
[1:33:46] <freelancebabymaker> and they also credit the artists and writers as well
[1:34:00] <$StephanieSadGirl> Yes, eat the stones, consume the stones
[1:34:14] <+RAGING_1NF3RNO> Is this gonna be a full playthrough?
[1:34:18] <$StephanieSadGirl> Real talk for a second, is Paige really quiet compared to the game for anyone else?
[1:34:31] <+ThomasOfTroy> A bit yeah
[1:34:32] <+SaphronBlackbourne> Yeah Paige is a bit low
[1:34:39] <+doc_ock_rokc> So we got beyonetta
[1:34:47] <+ThomasOfTroy> Yes
[1:34:50] <ergulor> yes
[1:34:53] <$StephanieSadGirl> Ah there is our mustard queen
[1:35:02] <%king_wragles> Paige is really getting into this game
[1:35:10] <+doc_ock_rokc> Sun is down
[1:35:22] <$StephanieSadGirl> Ah!  that makes sense!  If you eat the infinty stone it will wake you up!
[1:35:24] <freelancebabymaker> its a skill check
[1:35:27] <eustine> Mass effect perfect relead
[1:35:31] <+ThomasOfTroy> You must scream into the mic, like Elmo and Gief
[1:36:08] <TheTakkster> She says as she describes pat
[1:36:09] <Treasure_Vault> Is there different dialogue for Peter shooting it, Rocket shooting it, and you both shooting it?
[1:36:10] <freelancebabymaker> so pat then
[1:36:13] <QueequegTheater> That explains your engagement
[1:36:13] <$GarbageNirvana> Of course you do
[1:36:15] <$MikeTD81> Pat...?
[1:36:18] <$GarbageNirvana> You're engaged to Pat
[1:36:20] <$StephanieSadGirl> Oh no, that thing has tentacles and a sucker, that is a hentai monster!  RUN
[1:36:25] <eyeobject> Rocket isn't really cowardly though
[1:36:50] <$GarbageNirvana> Unlike Pat
[1:36:53] <eustine> Melee is so much damage
[1:36:57] <$GarbageNirvana> Who is a big coward
[1:37:46] <$StephanieSadGirl> Pat is a good orb
[1:37:46] <@Moobot> Hey check out Guardians of the Galaxy here! Thanks! tinyurl.com/2sk6ru2c
[1:38:01] <juan_wu_tamad> illusory wall
[1:38:12] <eyeobject> Does Drax pass the himbo test?
[1:38:13] <+Bailey__Gaming> some sort of craft in this mine
[1:38:22] <$StephanieSadGirl> Drax is not a himbo
[1:38:27] <dan_g_v> crafting?
[1:38:43] <dan_g_v> in the mines?
[1:38:47] <$StephanieSadGirl> Drax is not good natured and good meaning, he does good but I dont think he fits the himbo archetype
[1:38:58] <+PrimalDweeb> You'll be able to talk to rocket about it back on the ship.
[1:39:02] <eustine> tiny chestpiece?
[1:39:14] <lotharrio> Oh... it's the thing attached to Rocket's spine.
[1:39:43] <$StephanieSadGirl> Oh that is pretty
[1:40:03] <Mattais88> FF7R in here
[1:40:51] <eyeobject> Drax smash
[1:41:21] <$StephanieSadGirl> Wow paige, that was a sick ass kill, STYLISH
[1:41:40] <$StephanieSadGirl> Oh look, its Gamora and I am suddenly gayer
[1:42:40] <+LucentHolic> This might be the best licensed game ever, at least what I can think of.
[1:42:42] <+SWFanatic> psaBig
[1:43:06] <+PrimalDweeb> Move the thing to another platform behind you!
[1:43:08] <lotharrio> So Groot CCs enemies, Rocket does area damage, Drax staggers armored enemies, Gamora does high single target damage...
[1:43:10] <Treasure_Vault> @LucentHolic you are forgetting the unforgettable classic, Van Helsing (GBA)
[1:43:41] <mr_saturday93> huh figure it out faster than patq did
[1:44:01] <%JimmyRuss> pew pew pew
[1:44:22] <%JimmyRuss> Gamora do be kinda bad
[1:45:49] <eustine> lol
[1:45:54] <%king_wragles> I think AC/DC plays during this
[1:45:57] <%JimmyRuss> Every game needs a "hug your party" button
[1:46:04] <%king_wragles> well, when streamer mode is off
[1:46:26] <+SuichiTanaka> It's a shame that nothing plays when streamer mode is on
[1:46:34] <+juhbathehutt> the only advice I can give to people playing this is anytime someone talks STOP MOVING. there's so much good dialogue and boy is it easy to miss it by just taking a step lolol
[1:46:36] <TimetodiveLTX> this mechanic owns

[1:47:14] <D_J_ent> Peach, is it playing the music on your end in streaming mode?
[1:47:18] <+MooseIsGoose> the music really makes this part
[1:47:35] <%BallerSwagBro9k> I dont understand why the music created for the game doesn't play

[1:47:46] <eustine> DMCA problems
[1:47:50] <eyeobject> ENGORGED
[1:47:51] <+SuichiTanaka> Yeah, they made an entire custom album for this game, they could have played a StarLord song
[1:48:17] <%BallerSwagBro9k> @suichitanaka right? so weird
[1:48:21] <freelancebabymaker> @BallerSwagBro9k i thought that was a bug at first but the games been out for a while now
[1:48:22] <ohno778> murder mom
[1:48:25] <+juhbathehutt> @ballerswagbro9k Paige! seriously it should at least play a starlord song
[1:48:30] <D_J_ent> I highly recommend finding some time to play it off stream then
[1:48:38] <Mattais88> @BallerSwagBro9k What are you talking about? The volume on my mobile game I'm doing dailies on is a great OSt for Guardians!
[1:49:41] <+the_Punktuation> the_Punktuation subscribed with Prime. 
[1:50:08] <%JimmyRuss> I thought that was a streaming mode joke but it's a high frequency thing
[1:50:11] <+PrimalDweeb> They really never should have put the scanner in the game, it's useless for 98% of the game. But it always feels like you're missing something.

[2:17:36] <%BallerSwagBro9k> Youch
[2:17:49] <+TopTieramisu> bayo's mocapped actor is also short, which is humorous
[2:17:52] <+PrimalDweeb> Re activate
[2:17:53] <$StephanieSadGirl> @Sunstalker Bayo is meant to move like a dancer.  Facial mocap is difficult, its acting.  Dont discount the skill that goes into it
[2:18:02] <+MooseIsGoose> best one

[2:20:18] <$StephanieSadGirl> @troyMQN oh you shut up
[2:20:21] <+doc_ock_rokc> SHE ALMOST DIED
[2:20:21] <Sunstalker> You can't ground me, Mom. There's no ground in space
[2:20:22] <Djinnazz> she did almost die
[2:20:23] <Treasure_Vault> A space month could be three days or something
[2:20:23] <+doc_ock_rokc> TWICE
[2:20:28] <+Isa_Reynard> cycles = years?
[2:20:29] <+doc_ock_rokc> A month is nice

[2:21:26] <Run44forrest> Ignore the Math
[2:21:42] <$StephanieSadGirl> Whats up with me that when this point came up my thought was "Heck yeah, become a dad, make this a space dad simulator!"
[2:21:44] <+mecha_11> I am become the MATH
[2:21:45] <%BallerSwagBro9k> LUL LUL LUL

[2:22:01] <$StephanieSadGirl> @BallerSwagBro9k BABA IS MATH
[2:22:06] <Blank9> you did the math, 12 years ago

[2:22:22] <Sunstalker> Stealth llama
[2:22:27] <%BallerSwagBro9k> I for one am SUPER down for Dad Lord
[2:22:31] <%Ranryu692> because it's a bad idea lol
[2:22:36] <$StephanieSadGirl> @BallerSwagBro9k Heck yes
[2:22:43] <tanarath> I love how the game is everything the movies want to be.
[2:22:45] <pokefan9956> put another baby in her
[2:22:51] <%RealThiele> time for baby 2
[2:22:51] <$StephanieSadGirl> I want them to become space family
[2:22:51] <lotharrio> Kree are very susceptible to human charm.
[2:22:52] <%Ranryu692> probably
[2:22:52] <$troyMQN> one. two. five.
[2:22:52] <dmdyne99> Bribe the police with sexy time
[2:22:54] <$StephanieSadGirl> Yes they did a bang
[2:22:55] <+EdHeng> star-dad
[2:22:55] <%FingaLights> Maybe
[2:22:56] <Djinnazz> maybe
[2:22:58] <%BallerSwagBro9k> @tanarath right?
[2:23:00] <+doc_ock_rokc> Not yet
[2:23:01] <%JimmyRuss> She's just white-haired Undyne
[2:23:03] <%BallerSwagBro9k> yes
[2:23:05] <+PrimalDweeb> Saving the Llama gets you a $7000 fine. Saving the box gets you an $8000 fine, and not making a choice gets you a $9000 fine.
[2:23:07] <justicecadet> quickie
[2:23:08] <%JimmyRuss> Blue cop
[2:23:09] <+EdHeng> they did it in front of Chewie D:
[2:23:09] <eyeobject> Pay her back in bepis
[2:23:17] <OpenYourEels4TheNextFeels> IIRC yes, they only screw if you say you still have feeling for her
[2:23:39] <$Puhff> god i wish that were me
[2:23:50] <tanarath> @ballerswagbro9k I WANT to love the first movie, but they pad things & the writing is trash often. This game KILLED it, especially after that demo.
[2:23:51] <%FingaLights> I think Cycles are months
[2:23:54] <bear_breaker20> what
[2:24:00] <+manic_raven> cycles are days
[2:24:09] <bear_breaker20> why did peter call her mi6 wut
[2:24:12] <%FingaLights> I thought that was rotations
[2:24:22] <Sunstalker> rotation is a day, cycle is week
[2:24:22] <%BallerSwagBro9k> YOU ARE GROOT BibleThump
[2:24:23] <%Ranryu692> @bear_breaker20 James Bond was big in the 80s
[2:24:33] <+doc_ock_rokc> Yes
[2:24:34] <tanarath> YES
[2:24:35] <%kyh9> What, you never see Megas XLR?
[2:24:40] <+manic_raven> *SPOILERS* the game only lasts 3 days
[2:24:44] <bear_breaker20> eh that makes sense yeah @Ranryu692
[2:24:44] <+manic_raven> aka 3 cycles
[2:24:46] <+TopTieramisu> nuts
[2:24:46] <%kyh9> You may pilot a space ship or a giant robot but you're never too cool to be broke
[2:24:47] <eyeobject> I found a million credits in the couch
[2:24:48] <+doc_ock_rokc> James bond was big until realitively recently
[2:24:48] <freelancebabymaker> @peachsaliva shut the fridge
[2:24:49] <tanarath> Megas XLR was great
[2:25:16] <@PatStaresAt> penis penis penis penis penis lol
[2:25:25] <pokefan9956> lol pat
[2:25:30] <Sunstalker> Megas XLR can't ever come back because they wrote it off for taxes peepoSad
[2:25:32] <%Ranryu692> I still think about the time Megas XLR dunked on Hoboken to this day
[2:25:34] <freelancebabymaker> @PatStaresAt he cant keep getting away with this
[2:25:41] <eyeobject> Pat brings up a good point
[2:26:05] <+MooseIsGoose> Pat has brought forth some good points
[2:26:23] <+PrimalDweeb> Go to Rockets room, and find that thing you found earlier. You'll be able to talk to him about it.
[2:26:30] <freelancebabymaker> spaced his butt huh
[2:26:32] <%BallerSwagBro9k> Llama is in hangar
[2:26:38] <+doc_ock_rokc> Is pat speaking in groot language
[2:26:38] <$StephanieSadGirl> @PatStaresAt And you were shaming ME!  How dare?!
[2:26:51] <%Ranryu692> A'askavariians have tentacles for arms fyi
[2:27:23] <YakumoYomi> Gottem
[2:27:23] <@Moobot> Hey check out Guardians of the Galaxy here! Thanks! tinyurl.com/2sk6ru2c
[2:27:26] <%Ranryu692> I got a Dazzler statue just the other day

[2:27:34] <$vile_brand> wow he has a dazzler poster?
[2:27:38] <$StephanieSadGirl> @Ranryu692 Oh yeah?  is it good?
[2:27:42] <juan_wu_tamad> go talk to the looney toons ass llama pls
[2:27:45] <TimetodiveLTX> this is an interesting way to get people to appreciate the ship assets
[2:27:47] <$StephanieSadGirl> AFter seeing that Dazzler poster I want to get one for my room
[2:27:50] <+PrimalDweeb> Yep
[2:27:52] <%kyh9> It astounds me that the Sony Marvel stuff is in a different universe than the Square Enix one
[2:27:53] <eyeobject> Was that a space condom wrapper?
[2:27:53] <%cade_calrayn> 7 grand
[2:27:53] <freelancebabymaker> basically
[2:27:55] <+doc_ock_rokc> 7000 bucks
[2:27:55] <%JimmyRuss> Probably 7 million
[2:28:02] <+Isa_Reynard> didnt know Drax can do math
[2:28:05] <%JoshManVGH> Maybe.
[2:28:09] <+ThomasOfTroy> a $7000 fine should be THAT bad at all
[2:28:14] <+ThomasOfTroy> That'd be super doable
[2:28:15] <$StephanieSadGirl> DID HE SAY MOTHER FUCKING FIN FANG FOOM?!?!
[2:28:16] <D_J_ent> You had dialog with them
[2:28:23] <%RealThiele> 1 million spacebucks?!
[2:28:24] <%kyh9> There are some proper deep cuts in this game
[2:28:27] <freelancebabymaker> @StephanieSadGirl fuck yeah he did
[2:28:28] <%BallerSwagBro9k> @stephaniesadgirl HE SURE DID
[2:28:32] <+MooseIsGoose> Fin fang fang foom
[2:28:32] <$Puhff> prolly
[2:28:38] <+PrimalDweeb> You jumped the gun, always look around and talk before you do what you're supposed too.
[2:28:44] <%Ranryu692> @Ranryu692 Yeah. Diamond Select makes some solid statues
[2:28:45] <$StephanieSadGirl> Okay okay, WTF did they just ask the galaxy's deadlist assassin to sell her anime tiddy statues?!
[2:28:50] <$Puhff> PAAAAAIGE
[2:28:51] <justicecadet> she's not selling ghe waifu figures
[2:28:53] <eyeobject> Groot, we gotta COOK!
[2:29:06] <$StephanieSadGirl> @Ranryu692 Oh yeah they do, I have Captain Marvel and Jane Foster thor from them, I gotta check out the Dazzler one
[2:29:06] <%JoshManVGH> The amount of dialog in this game is INSANE!
[2:29:11] <+PrimalDweeb> LUL
[2:29:26] <%JoshManVGH> This scene is different in quite a few ways from mine
[2:29:27] <%BallerSwagBro9k> Muh anime figures
[2:29:33] <+Isa_Reynard> Gamora having a personality? i like this one already
[2:29:33] <+trackles_64> is groot still voice by vin diesel in this?
[2:29:34] <YakumoYomi> Very inspiring, Groot
[2:29:36] <freelancebabymaker> LMAO
[2:29:40] <%BallerSwagBro9k> Apes together strong
[2:29:44] <lotharrio> Fin Fang Foom is TOTALLY loaded.
[2:29:46] <%BallerSwagBro9k> LUL LUL LUL
[2:29:48] <$StephanieSadGirl> @Isa_Reynard Right?  Its like she is a person and not just someone to drive quill's story
[2:29:57] <JetpackMcQuack> WutFace
[2:30:07] <+Isa_Reynard> @StephanieSadGirl that was my gripe with the MCU one too
[2:30:08] <%Ranryu692> @Ranryu692 I have a diamond-form Emma Frost from them too that's fab
[2:30:18] <YakumoYomi> Rocket is super protective of his boy
[2:30:33] <Estwilde> True
[2:30:35] <+Zinri_Luck> pat
[2:30:39] <+Shaggnar> I mean yeah
[2:30:40] <JetpackMcQuack> maybe evena salary
[2:30:51] <+PrimalDweeb> You can change your mind later
[2:30:51] <Sunstalker> I feel like Rocket would have been voiced by Seth Green if the movies got made 10 years earlier
[2:30:52] <eyeobject> Awww they love each other
[2:30:53] <+MooseIsGoose> Choices
[2:30:54] <%zeroarturia> Groot is the last of his kind
[2:30:58] <ergulor> i vote for the raccon
[2:31:05] <eyeobject> Sell that trash panda
[2:31:07] <mr_saturday93> Both could actually
[2:31:08] <$StephanieSadGirl> @Ranryu692 I really shouldnt be buying statues when I'm between jobs...
[2:31:10] <%BallerSwagBro9k> Choose Drax woolieMIRIN
[2:31:16] <JetpackMcQuack> but it's a mean racoon
[2:31:35] <lotharrio> I feel like Rocket could sneak his way out... not sure she'd be paying too much for him.
[2:31:38] <+doc_ock_rokc> Rocket is scarry
[2:31:40] <+Shaggnar> Rocket is a monster on the inside
[2:31:41] <%Ranryu692> she kidnapped the Hulk to put him in her collection one time
[2:31:42] <D_J_ent> Yeah, Hellbender would pay more for Drax if it was an option lol
[2:31:42] <freelancebabymaker> they are both one of a kind tho
[2:31:44] <%king_wragles> Plus, you'll want Rocket to help plan the break out
[2:31:51] <%zeroarturia> A racoon isn't exactly rare
[2:31:54] <$Puhff> I don't think there's a "wrong" answer
[2:31:55] <xxshadowxx416> he a talk racoon
[2:31:55] <JetpackMcQuack> he'll call you some nasty things
[2:31:57] <+doc_ock_rokc> @king_wragles You got a point
[2:32:00] <$GarbageNirvana> Man I wanna play this but Lord knows how it runs on PS4
[2:32:01] <%king_wragles> @zeroarturia In space they are
[2:32:03] <%Ranryu692> last of his kind vs the only one of his kind to ever exist
[2:32:03] <%BallerSwagBro9k> I cant wait for Lady Hellbender Kreygasm
[2:32:09] <$Puhff> what a bout the llama?
[2:32:11] <fairore> a talking raccon is rare
[2:32:13] <lotharrio> Talking cyborg racoons from space are rare.
