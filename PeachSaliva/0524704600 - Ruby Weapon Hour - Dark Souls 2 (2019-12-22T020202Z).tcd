[0:16:33] <$Chatterbox1991> MrDestructoid500 Good evening you angels, if i could ask a favor of you two, could you commisserate with Woolie to decide on what day of Magfest you all intend to do the fan meet up? i might only be able to afford to go for one day and would prefer to go on the day where i meet you guys. PS; unpopular opinion apparently, i saw Skywalker yesterday and i thought it was a flawed but otherwise great movie and i think the people who say its the death of Star Wars are radically overexaggerating

[0:29:52] <+Darren716> Zereaux Its been out for 2 days
[0:29:53] <%emoonimoo> Paige, how dare you talk about movie??
[0:29:53] <+A_Jojo_Reference> The movie's called Rise of Skywalker? what a spoiler
[0:29:56] <Tressing> Spoilers began like a month before the movie was even out..
[0:29:57] <DatAsuna> nice

[0:30:02] <+Pookiedaexzile> Star Wars been Bad, and will always be bad. Cept for Kotor
[0:30:03] <$Trash_LOVELIVEathan> we're all assholes here
[0:30:03] <%skizzuto> perfect for sticking in bagels
[0:30:03] <artoflec> a dick is ideally cleaner and more respectable than an asshole
[0:30:04] <+AMagicalFlute> I think Elmo is the biggest asshole
[0:30:05] <%Alpha8087> Palpatine was invited to a Bocce Ball tourney
[0:30:05] <%CommanderSqueaks> Are Star Wars fans slowly becoming Fate fans...?
[0:30:07] <GarbageQueenEllie> Yea I'm not gonna watch the movie. I just want spoilers for giggles
[0:30:08] <nikoloas_> LUL
[0:30:12] <%Shadowpint> You're a well exfoliated lubed up dick
[0:30:17] <$shadylawyerman> People can go stuff it
[0:30:17] <@MelBrooksKA> Paige, please stop vaguely alluding to something that happened at some point
[0:30:18] <ExpressNode> What's the difference between an asshole or a dick?
[0:30:25] <%umbypokochan> taints > assholes
[0:30:26] <%Archer2150> Archer2150 subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 14 months! Paige im sorry that I made fun of you earlier, I still love you guys

[0:30:32] <+Zereaux> i dont care if you cared that much you would have watched it already
[0:30:34] <LokimenD> KEKW
[0:30:35] <%Jekado> @SoFarFetched more like Detective paige = Dick Paige
[0:30:36] <%QueequegTheater> So the same as TLJ
[0:30:38] <Sphincter_Spelunker> k
[0:30:38] <KoyFoster> SW died a long time ago.
[0:30:41] <%stagemage> I can't believe Revan shows up to address the fans and asks if they're having a good movie
[0:30:41] <Neo_Kaiser> Disney killed Star Wars
[0:30:43] <%SpamKingRathalos> Star Wars died a long time ago
[0:30:45] <+patriotrenegade> Star Wars alreadydied with TLJ
[0:30:46] <+MalekDracarus> @CommanderSqueaks stop this
[0:30:49] <$StaceMcGate> VoteNay
[0:30:51] <TurtlesAndTentacles> Yes
[0:30:52] <+VashyronM> People just need to chill the fuck out about SW.
[0:30:53] <BaronVonMagpie> well I mean it is the death of starwars, unless The Mouse defibs it again
[0:30:53] <FacetiousAF> i'd rather donate $20 so we can skip any other donations n shit with star wars talk in them
[0:30:54] <+eanscrale> Yo, you guys remember revenge of the sith?
[0:30:54] <lloyddboy> No one's really ever gone...
[0:30:54] <SilverFaustX> yes
[0:30:54] <Dragon_Batman> The prequels exist, there is no way those are better
[0:30:57] <+Darren716> I mean they could have made a good movie
[0:30:57] <+Promessa_EX> Star Wars has been dead
[0:30:57] <DrFacilier> George lucas was the death of star wars
[0:30:58] <+MurlinDurl> SeemsGood
[0:30:59] <TurtlesAndTentacles> Out of 5 stars it's a 3
[0:31:00] <%Gogogolem> You took shit and made a shit sandwich.
[0:31:00] <%THATGUY_789> can't wait for RLM breakdown
[0:31:00] <Fujiwara_92> Star Wars killed Star wars
[0:31:02] <$shadylawyerman> Agreed
[0:31:03] <lethallylactic> Ehhh, I think they made their own grave and then collapsed into it. LUL
[0:31:04] <fruit_pie_the_magician> Lucas killed star wars in like 99
[0:31:04] <xeros720> quite literally, they are doing their best
[0:31:04] <+dante_must_die_exe> No one is ever really gone
[0:31:07] <Tucker0603> fucking disney shouldnt have called the EU non-canon
[0:31:08] <GarbageQueenEllie> I think it sucks that the movies are boring now. I hope they try something different next time
[0:31:10] <artoflec> 5.6/10 - it was the best they could have done lobosKek
[0:31:11] <+Pookiedaexzile> STAR WARS WAS/IS/WILL BE BAD
[0:31:12] <Truinz25> And the best that comes out to is mediocre so that tells you what the previous moves is
[0:31:14] <Tressing> They made the best they could.. from the mess they made..
[0:31:14] <+MurlinDurl> was i the only one who liked solo? i feel insane sometimes
[0:31:15] <+Freelance7> Maybe they should've planned out the entire trilogy instead of flying by the seat of their pants
[0:31:16] <+cdrom321> @ExpressNode Dicks try to fuck everything without thinking in through. Assholes just shit all over everything.
[0:31:16] <Aydarkzero> like Final Fantasy 13
[0:31:17] <derekwst3> @PeachSaliva was there any sand
[0:31:17] <lycandruid> Starwars is a huge whale dw it not going away
[0:31:18] <Mister_McDerp> the mandalorian is fucking great
[0:31:18] <%Jekado> Did you see yong yeh reaction when walking out of the theater he looks defeated
[0:31:19] <+patriotrenegade> Damn Star Wars! It ruined Star Wars!
[0:31:19] <NaturalGear> same
[0:31:19] <Neo_Kaiser> The toys aren't selling
[0:31:19] <%kjsandwich> Yup
[0:31:19] <stripey_menace> people say every single sequel/prequel killed star wars when they came out
[0:31:22] <%starotter70> For better or worse, start wars is immortal
[0:31:22] <TurtlesAndTentacles> alot of people say that
[0:31:22] <$shadylawyerman> YAs exactly
[0:31:25] <Aydarkzero> guess what game is still going on fuckers
[0:31:27] <SilverFaustX> that was solo
[0:31:27] <%Ion_Laser> If Star Wars was gonna die, George Lucas would have done it if he did all of the Star Wars moviesunedited
[0:31:27] <%Bailey__gaming> Man do is pretty dope tbh
[0:31:27] <%juxtest> They did
[0:31:29] <%THATGUY_789> we need to go far. far away form the episode universe
[0:31:29] <+Darren716> They did
[0:31:29] <%DesertPenguin> Rogue One was a heist movie
[0:31:31] <Sp3ctre48> That was Solo
[0:31:31] <+Your_heals> woolieSMUG
[0:31:31] <+apocplz> so like Solo
[0:31:32] <+Mr_Pylon> They did
[0:31:32] <%abelincoln_catpuncher> @PeachSaliva Rise of Skywalker is the Dark Souls of Star Wars
[0:31:33] <KingKZ> I've lost almost all interest in mainline Star Wars.
[0:31:33] <+machshop> or perhaps a western
[0:31:33] <Neo_Kaiser> They tried that, it was called Solo
[0:31:34] <%maskofmichael> Predictions for episode 10?
[0:31:34] <+apocplz> barbLUL
[0:31:34] <+xmetalicdemonx> Rogue One
[0:31:35] <+MurlinDurl> SOLO WAS GOOD I DUN CARE
[0:31:35] <+Pookiedaexzile> You mean like they did
[0:31:36] <%DesertPenguin> Solo was shit
[0:31:36] <$NitronStreams> Remember when the Prequels killed star wars?
[0:31:37] <OvaltineDream> Scale it down, star wars
[0:31:37] <%QueequegTheater> @PeachSaliva They weren't "given" shit, they brought it on themselves. Giving all 3 films to either Johnson or Abrams instead of both would've made all three movies better
[0:31:37] <%thejimjamz> I would pay good money for a movie about Droids doing dumb shit
[0:31:37] <+Darren716> That was rouge one
[0:31:37] <%MyNameIsRasus> I think they had 0 plan as to where to end the trilogy and that fucking shows
[0:31:38] <%stagemage> look get back to me when Irek Ismaren and his LIGHTSABER SUIT gets into the movies
[0:31:40] <ShichiNoBushi> End of this saga, but there are going to be more Star Wars movies and series.
[0:31:41] <%Alpha8087> I had fun running a heist in Cloud City with the FFG Star Wars game
[0:31:42] <Tressing> Rogue One?
[0:31:42] <a_mad_dragon> a new hope was basically a heist movie
[0:31:43] <+Freelance7> Rogue One was bad though
[0:31:43] <Sp3ctre48> And it wasnt good LUL
[0:31:44] <SilverFaustX> rogue one was a war movie
[0:31:44] <FirearmsInstructor> WHO'S TALKING!? D:
[0:31:44] <Mister_McDerp> SOLO WAS A HEIST MOVIE
[0:31:45] <%SoFarFetched> Pat's a monster can Now.
[0:31:45] <%Bailey__gaming> GIVE ME KOTOR
[0:31:46] <%RNGbob> SUBTLE MONSTER LOGO IN FRAME
[0:31:46] <+theodolitejones> The first part of Jedi was essentially a heist movie
[0:31:47] <dredshift> They did do a heist movie Pat
[0:31:47] <%Ion_Laser> Rogue One was a Dark Forces movie
[0:31:48] <DatAsuna> LP kotor 2
[0:31:50] <SubliminaIMessages> Isn’t Solo the heist movie?
[0:31:50] <%Typhaeon> Rogue One had a man with a stick that somehow knocked around people in full armor
[0:31:52] <+Your_heals> KOTOR but game of thrones
[0:31:53] <%Jekado> Ewok Christmas special 2?
[0:31:53] <Sphincter_Spelunker> I just want Sith race
[0:31:54] <Dementedpenguin> That would be too easy, Pat.
[0:31:54] <ExpressNode> @cdrom321 I love that TeamAmerica anology
[0:31:55] <Neo_Kaiser> Disney would ruin Kreia!
[0:31:57] <XzileGaming> Keeping Up With The Skywalkers
[0:31:57] <+patriotrenegade> The middle of TLG was a heist
[0:31:58] <+flying_hipp0> just let it die
[0:31:58] <+MurlinDurl> rogue one was pretty good
[0:31:59] <+Kairi__> KOTOR series Kreygasm
[0:31:59] <peachy996> Solo sucked
[0:31:59] <waterstealer> solo sucked
[0:32:01] <xeros720> i want them to hold up a bank and shit hits the fan because there's a jedi in the lobby
[0:32:01] <KingKZ> I never want to hear "Force" again.
[0:32:01] <InugamiTheHound> bring back werewolf jedi from the clone wars cartoon
[0:32:02] <%starotter70> Solo exists?
[0:32:03] <%stagemage> a good Heist movie then
[0:32:03] <%maenos2> Revan was mentioned
[0:32:03] <SulfurousAcid> KOTOR isn't cannon anymore, right?
[0:32:04] <+dante_must_die_exe> BRING BACK STAR KILLER YOU COWARDS
[0:32:05] <TheWinged7> sipsipGasm
[0:32:05] <GarbageQueenEllie> Give us Ashoka's sexy gray Jedi adventures in spaaaace
[0:32:06] <+machshop> Mandalorian is a western
[0:32:08] <+D00msDayDan> i just want them to make good movies but they REFUSE
[0:32:08] <waterstealer> remember the leet robot?
[0:32:09] <+xmetalicdemonx> I want a Jaba the Hut porn movie.
[0:32:11] <%Jekado> they are making a obi wan movie right?
[0:32:11] <%THATGUY_789> Blame Lucas for starting at 4 instead of 1
[0:32:12] <kruggalo> A movie following the cantina band
[0:32:12] <+cdrom321> @ExpressNode It's the best.
[0:32:17] <$shadylawyerman> Rouge One was the best this decade
[0:32:18] <+patriotrenegade> BEEF MCLARGEHUGE
[0:32:18] <%arsonistdaria> Pat what if all the aliens spike like in Kotor
[0:32:19] <+SweepTheLegoMyEggo> star trek is better anyways
[0:32:19] <+logoth_> Solo was a DOCUMENTARY, and the events happened in real time
[0:32:19] <%ArtemisM822> This movie, which I did kind of like, was basically just borrowing from the expanded universe
[0:32:20] <Roz_Lynd> i name characters shit like "milk"
[0:32:21] <+Zereaux> @PeachSaliva you catch any of the witcher netflix series?
[0:32:21] <%starotter70> Hank Hill
[0:32:22] <Sphincter_Spelunker> @SulfurousAcid ummmm. well, about that..
[0:32:23] <peachy996> Just make a new star wars and stop connecting to the past
[0:32:24] <transporterthesequel> No you can't have force powers without being born from Palpatine juice tho.
[0:32:24] <lightsout177> did i miss any gameplay ? jk
[0:32:24] <%SoFarFetched> CLUMBO
[0:32:24] <%kjsandwich> Star Wars has the most back and forth fanbase. When they’re cool, they’re cool but shitty Star Wars fans really suck
[0:32:24] <ECRead> I haven't faith in the mouse to allow any meaningful expansion

[0:33:54] <derekwst3> I didn't like the first episode but liked the second, haven't watch the rest yet
[0:33:54] <GarbageQueenEllie> I think it's a hit-or-miss, it doesn't seem like it's for everyone
[0:33:54] <%superc37> it's really good
[0:34:00] <%rumtumtugnutz> Harley says the fuck word a lot.
[0:34:00] <%QueequegTheater> Giving all 3 films to either Johnson or Abrams instead of both would've made all three movies better

[0:34:04] <%stagemage> It would be better if venture brothers wasnt a better version
[0:34:04] <squirtkitten> chat hates everything part deux LUL
[0:34:06] <Aydarkzero> the jokes were pretty funny
[0:34:06] <Stab_master_ars0n> It’s trash
[0:34:06] <InugamiTheHound> kenpachi ramasama
[0:34:06] <+VashyronM> Joker is Robin
[0:34:07] <%Jekado> edgelord batman i would watch that
[0:34:07] <FacetiousAF> they let the DC people swear
[0:34:08] <%ForneusAtSeaWorld> ForneusAtSeaWorld subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 23 months! Hey Paige, glad i could catch the stream you both are great
[0:34:09] <@Calek> Harley Quinn is a fun show, scratches the Venture Bros itch but not completely
[0:34:10] <%THATGUY_789> I thought it was funny
[0:34:11] <peachy996> But edgelord Batamn is batman
[0:34:14] <FacetiousAF> its an R-rated cartoon
[0:34:15] <Mister_McDerp> it seemed okay to me
[0:34:17] <%Ion_Laser> Edgelord Batman. Isn't that just Batman?
[0:34:25] <Neo_Kaiser> Harley fights the patriarchy
[0:34:27] <+Wrashis> but is the take hot
[0:34:29] <%starotter70> @Ion_Laser Was about to say
[0:34:30] <@SSaryn> It's got some stuff at least but yeah, eh.
[0:34:30] <SilverFaustX> they should have made a 9 hour movie and cut it in 3
[0:34:30] <%Gogogolem> Episode 3 is bad
[0:34:32] <soraabora> im just kinda over crude adult cartoons
[0:34:33] <%ShaneWhite> ShaneWhite subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 12 months, currently on a 12 month streak! Paige 1 year and here is to many more, Its been fun along this journey between you, Pat and Elmo, it is a fun but also crazy journey to. Good luck on the stream and have fun
[0:34:33] <$NitronStreams> I thought it was okay just not for me
[0:34:33] <+Freelance7> Any clip I saw from that Harley show wasn't that funny
[0:34:35] <%Jekado> no like a series called "Edgelord Batman"
[0:34:38] <Aydarkzero> just b/c you like something doesn't mean you can't occasionally laugh at it
[0:34:39] <dredshift> We need more dry wit Batman. Edgelord Batman has always sucked.

[0:43:05] <+VashyronM> Okay. I heard 2 days and was fucking scared.
[0:43:06] <arcanemacrocosm> the show is based on the book, show is good
[0:43:08] <InugamiTheHound> I just bought a halo book.
[0:43:10] <%Jekado> CYBERPUNKKKK
[0:43:11] <+Doomtastic> the books are fantastic
[0:43:12] <%DesertPenguin> @PomegranateKing Good for you dude/dudette
[0:43:13] <%Jekado> i can't wait
[0:43:13] <ExpressNode> I do the same thing with my books
[0:43:13] <+Your_heals> Just play 3 imo
[0:43:13] <Fujiwara_92> the books are good, the series is good
[0:43:13] <%starotter70> That'd be neat
[0:43:14] <GarbageQueenEllie> I heard Geralt's not as much of a Chad in the books as in the games
[0:43:14] <DatAsuna> start on 2
[0:43:15] <%worldbrand> 1 might drive you insane
[0:43:15] <digaogrunge> 1 is insane
[0:43:16] <+Mr_Pylon> Start on 2
[0:43:16] <lloyddboy> DO ONE COWARD
[0:43:16] <TikanZK> Geralts parts in the books are amazing, Ciri's parts are.... weird
[0:43:16] <Dragon_Batman> I would say 2 more than 1
[0:43:17] <OldManDeckardCain> STREAM WITCHER
[0:43:18] <eiightbiitt> do 3
[0:43:19] <crystalmoonark> Start off on 1!
[0:43:19] <%QueequegTheater> Don't, 3 is self contained
[0:43:19] <Aydarkzero> should i watch the show if i never read or played the games>
[0:43:20] <BaronVonMagpie> play witcher one its weird as shit!
[0:43:20] <%Gogogolem> 9 outta 10 on the witcher series.
[0:43:21] <+ClaudeMcGarren> @Jekado very excited
[0:43:23] <+Zereaux> 3
[0:43:24] <+apocplz> sounds about right
[0:43:24] <%Deadmanslegacy> just do 3
[0:43:24] <Mr_Bop> 1 is good but Jank
[0:43:26] <+Dayube> just play 3
[0:43:29] <+BrogorkTheFork> I liked Witcher a lot
[0:43:29] <Reanimator83> It’s good
[0:43:29] <derekwst3> one sucks, start with 2 or 3
[0:43:30] <terribleusername> i love 1
[0:43:30] <dekkitout> Was it a heated Paige moment?
[0:43:30] <CriticKitten> Start on 2, 1 is bleh
[0:43:30] <%rumtumtugnutz> it's another excuse to crank one out to Henry Cavill
[0:43:32] <+Doomtastic> the first 2 witcher books are really fun
[0:43:32] <+Zereaux> 2 didnt age well
[0:43:32] <+Mekhet09> But you can't even play dragon's dogma.
[0:43:33] <Tucker0603> idk why but i couldnt care less about witcher, tried 2 and 3 and i didnt like it :/
[0:43:34] <Fujiwara_92> just do 3
[0:43:34] <garbageheaphound> 2 is good
[0:43:35] <+flying_hipp0> Witcher 1 good???
[0:43:35] <KingKZ> Knowing nothing about the Witcher, I found it to be pretty good.
[0:43:36] <MookStyfawker> Witcher 1 is the hyper jank.
[0:43:36] <Sphincter_Spelunker> 2's cool
[0:43:36] <%Deadmanslegacy> you can safely skip the others
[0:43:37] <@MelBrooksKA> 3
[0:43:37] <TwentyCXII> The first two are godawful
[0:43:38] <%rumtumtugnutz> so I'm in
[0:43:39] <Dragon_Batman> You have to be willing to be ok with the Jank
[0:43:40] <MrNoobMcSalt> just do three
[0:43:41] <%ShaneWhite> LUL
[0:43:41] <+VashyronM> Start with 2
[0:43:41] <%maskofmichael> I never heard of Witcher until 3 came out
[0:43:42] <%juxtest> Starting on 2 is fine
[0:43:42] <%skm742> Started on 3, but haven't played others, so I can't really speak for them. 3 was great though.
[0:43:43] <TheHeroAppears> you troglodyte
[0:43:44] <+KongolComet> Damn ritght it's a good game!
[0:43:46] <%Shadowpint> I'm probably gonna skip 1 and 2 and play 3
[0:43:50] <%Typhaeon> It's got a rhythm
[0:43:50] <%Gogogolem> witcher 2
[0:43:52] <%juxtest> Its old
[0:43:54] <+mh9s> VERY eurojank and fun
[0:43:55] <%Typhaeon> I personally enjoyed it
[0:43:55] <bigstupidjellyfish1337> start with 2
[0:43:55] <eiightbiitt> 3 is good to play
[0:43:56] <@Calek> doesn't matter what Witcher you play it's gonna be bad combat regardless
[0:43:56] <+Doomtastic> the controls aged poooorly
[0:43:57] <+VashyronM> It's a fucked up game for crazy people
[0:43:58] <takiyami> honestly, start with 2 and we can fill you in with the backstory as you go
[0:43:58] <GarbageQueenEllie> Doesn't matter, as long as you fuck ALL THE BABES
[0:43:58] <garbageheaphound> ITS OLD
[0:43:59] <TwinBat> you should atleast play 2
[0:43:59] <crystalmoonark> Great story bad controls
[0:43:59] <@MelBrooksKA> Eurojank^2
[0:43:59] <NaturalGear> it's very good
[0:43:59] <+KENTASHIRO> It's an eastern europe PCRPG, it's super fucked
[0:43:59] <+keyoray> @Aydarkzero I would, enjoy all medium.
[0:44:00] <+Mr_Pylon> 2 is cool and you don't need to care about 1
[0:44:00] <+flying_hipp0> i put question marks for a reason
[0:44:01] <Dakuu75> Geralts face is the most jank thing in 1
[0:44:02] <DatAsuna> it's good jank
[0:44:02] <Tressing> Play it on Stream.. rage Paige..
[0:44:04] <TikanZK> crazy euro jank for super crazy polish nerds
[0:44:04] <+ClaudeMcGarren> 1 is jank as hell
[0:44:04] <SulfurousAcid> what game?
[0:44:05] <icosahedralAPOI> the story is excellent but the gameplay is mediocre
[0:44:05] <+flying_hipp0> sarcasm gurl
[0:44:06] <Emperor_Machinus> I like it
[0:44:06] <SubliminaIMessages> I got all the games. Wanna play them in one sitting but oh boy I hear bad things about 1
[0:44:07] <Fujiwara_92> just do 3 for real
[0:44:07] <%Lion_kun> Combat is terrible
[0:44:08] <+emperordread> I totally bailed on Witcher 1
[0:44:09] <%tigerfang86> crazy people are pretty cool sometimes
[0:44:10] <LixFury> Old Euro PC jank
[0:44:12] <primaryfire> witcher 3 is extremely popular and borderline mainstream
[0:44:12] <%tigerfang86> Some times
[0:44:14] <+dante_must_die_exe> I finished The Witcher and I regret everything
[0:44:14] <derekwst3> 1 sucks, 2 is okay, 3 is awesome
[0:44:17] <%Lion_kun> Left click to attack, right click to defend lol
[0:44:19] <%skm742> @SulfurousAcid witcher 1
[0:44:19] <@MelBrooksKA> @SulfurousAcid Wither 1

[1:37:15] <+irvile> Paige is the type of person to press on the gas pedal when a pedestrian jump in front of her car
[1:37:15] <+Mitchellsocks> No.
[1:37:15] <EuropanLamprey> yes
[1:37:17] <%QueequegTheater> No, DS3 isn't particularly deep combat-wise
[1:37:17] <+cdrom321> I thought it did.
[1:37:17] <+NobleJedi> DS3 combat was fine tuned
[1:37:17] <BearSawed> Its a toggle
[1:37:17] <CalderGaming> no this was a special fuck you to ds2 players
[1:37:20] <$RC_S3kshun8> Yeah I could 360 noscope that thing
[1:37:24] <meermadon> yes, but it was optional
[1:37:26] <+patriotrenegade> jesus
[1:37:26] <Hydrapissed> u can set it as an option
[1:37:28] <$Punisher7771> gotta cheat
[1:37:29] <%QueequegTheater> @NobleJedi *Simplified for casuals
[1:37:29] <Hydrapissed> if u want
[1:37:30] <+MurlinDurl> notlikethis
[1:37:32] <Hellarussian> getting rocked by jobbers
[1:37:33] <FirearmsInstructor> @cureneckbeard That's a decent amount of souls...
[1:37:34] <spiritofmojave> GS are far better in DS3 for basically that difference imo
[1:37:36] <$RC_S3kshun8> I always would use lock on though
[1:37:37] <+guildmasterahnonay> It's super good in pvp, it just takes getting used to.
[1:37:39] <Coystick> But ark 3 didn't have power stancing so FUCK DARK 3, I hope Elden Ring brings it back

[1:37:52] <Hydrapissed> yep toggle in ds3 for the direction siwng
[1:37:53] <+patriotrenegade> Grand LAnce doesnt (thats a lie)
[1:37:53] <+NobleJedi> @QueequegTheater eh
[1:37:54] <primaryfire> you'd need to lock-off in ds3
[1:37:56] <TurtlesAndTentacles> why arent you swiping? Why slamming down? @PeachSaliva
[1:37:57] <+logoth_> Peach would really benefit from a weapon with a wider attack arc

[2:14:01] <@Calek> @jphengstler this is DS2 not 3 Kappa
[2:14:01] <SpaceGuntank> is this the one where more start showing up if you dont kill them fast enough?
[2:14:07] <LokimenD> Paige just hit them
[2:14:07] <Sphincter_Spelunker> I don't remember lightning
[2:14:12] <RetributionP> this is such a good boos fight theme

[2:14:21] <CurrySauseBandit> This boos fight is way easier without locking on imo.

[2:14:24] <+guildmasterahnonay> I think the Lightning attack is scholar only

[2:21:34] <Kalcom> it's good for facefucking

[2:21:36] <+Darren716> LUL

[2:21:42] <Sphincter_Spelunker> skeptic's lowers requirements, yes

[2:21:46] <+patriotrenegade> It decreases the faith requirement for a miracle
[2:21:46] <waterstealer> skeptic spice lowers requirement for miracles
[2:21:48] <%QueequegTheater> @PeachSaliva It's not a timer
[2:21:49] <Zarkith> That's not what Skeptic Spice does. It reduces the skill req. for casting a spell
[2:21:52] <Amardeux> you can summon helpers don't forget
[2:21:52] <LoliKappa> aren't we all?
[2:21:53] <%QueequegTheater> It's total damag
[2:21:57] <KoyaMusa> there is totally not a timer

[2:22:01] <$Trenr> 3 at a time
[2:22:03] <Tampaoster> maximum of 5
[2:22:06] <Sphincter_Spelunker> it's magic shit, Pat can be wrong about it
[2:22:09] <DedlokPM> @PeachSaliva It is culmative damage based
[2:22:11] <Finakala> Pretty sure it is a timer like Four Kings is
[2:22:12] <bag4l1fe> half health another is summoned
[2:22:15] <SulfurousAcid> focus on killing one at a time
[2:22:16] <+MurlinDurl> i swear its a timer no?
[2:22:16] <+Mitchellsocks> i think it's 90%, 80%, 60%
[2:22:16] <%imadoc91> I thought it was damage based
[2:22:28] <%imadoc91> so focus one at a time
