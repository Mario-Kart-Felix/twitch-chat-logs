[0:17:48] <GoldeNOVA> Paige is an international spy

[0:17:49] <%QueequegTheater> Paige are you ddoing a hentai voiceover
[0:17:49] <+badchoice5> That sounds like Tomorrow Paige's problem
[0:17:50] <+Cigwynn> I just got here, what's going on? Is Paige going on a trip???
[0:17:53] <RollCritFail> Pat and Paige were too powerful together and thus the UN had to separate them for a short period of time to let the earth heal

[0:18:18] <$ESP_ROOT> DansGame
[0:18:21] <Nina96> @King_Krimzon damn

[0:18:46] <%starotter70> @schroedingersferret I knew it
[0:18:47] <%QueequegTheater> It's not that I dislike change, it's that minor changes like this cause me to feel ants crawling inside my brain
[0:18:49] <+SolverCODO> Pat is the gross for both of you
[0:18:49] <Fujiwara_92> She's working on a JAV Kappa
[0:18:50] <zamzoph> @PeachSaliva How has the Japanese McDonald's been?
[0:18:52] <+GenesisPatton> Oi Peach. Was just gonna play some background music for Warframe, and I saw your face.
[0:18:54] <$ac262> Typing: the stream
[0:18:57] <%Ell1ot> the hypest noodle slurping on TwitchTube
[0:18:58] <%QueequegTheater> Pat is the ideal male body
[0:19:01] <Luesagna00> @peachsaliva wtf... r u eating CUP noodles? i recognize those noodles anywhere >:c
[0:19:02] <DracaenaLeaf> Pat is so gross have you seen him alone when woolie leaves the room
[0:19:02] <+badchoice5> Wonderful, but still gross
[0:19:04] <noheartnooil> one time I saw Pat do a kick flip so he's pretty rad
[0:19:04] <+Skittlesoul> apatOrange apatOrange apatOrange
[0:19:08] <%QueequegTheater> @Nina96 How dare
[0:19:08] <$nademonkey1100> LUL that is true love
[0:19:08] <$Arazien> But now who will keep Pat in line and check his cans for centipedes?
[0:19:09] <EASrake> It's that easy huh?
[0:19:10] <+SolverCODO> It must be nice to have someone who can inspire you to tell life to fuck off
[0:19:13] <lizard0tm> is there no McDonalds available? I'm surprised by the choice of ramen over Micky D's
[0:19:14] <PlainSimpleTailor> Have we established that Paige is actually in Panty Machine Land?
[0:19:17] <azure_end> Pat is the wonderfulest.
[0:19:18] <+arancet> i like how pats idea of comfort is "bitch its fine"
[0:19:19] <randomp141> @PeachSaliva Slap pat for thinking muffin's are the same as cakes, Cakes be they cupcakes ore real cakes use different ingredients.
[0:19:19] <lizard0tm> LUL
[0:19:19] <+badchoice5> That doesn't surprise me
[0:19:21] <%Ell1ot> did she turn you into a newt?
[0:19:23] <DesuDesuDokiDoki> yeyeye
[0:19:26] <RadSuit> And then LUPUS
[0:19:28] <dsauce999> Oh no, here we go again. LUL
[0:19:29] <$ESP_ROOT> FeelsBadMan shes keeping the japanese mcdonalds secrets to herself
[0:19:30] <%QueequegTheater> Is that where the shadow puzzles came from
[0:19:30] <+Cigwynn> Paige was cursed to love McDonalds octoSad
[0:19:30] <+AmaniIsYourBoss> *insert "Here we go again" meme here*
[0:19:32] <Nina96> @QueequegTheater i dare
[0:19:32] <%ElenaManetta> Is that before or after the Scrooge dream
[0:19:34] <+cafefunk> Pat is a big ol softie under all that bitter crust
[0:19:34] <+ronim93> Then pat appeared
[0:19:34] <DesuDesuDokiDoki> and then beyonetta
[0:19:34] <$ac262> Is that why you met pat?
[0:19:35] <ShichiNoBushi> Then she gave you lupus.
[0:19:36] <+Hilleltaco> Last stream's issues must have been the witch curse
[0:19:37] <InkyDraconian> become a witch and curse her back lol
[0:19:38] <Plutt_bug> You ever think of doing work as a zombie, you won't need much makeup.
[0:19:39] <+Skittlesoul> is that how you got lupus
[0:19:41] <azure_end> That's how she got Lupus.
[0:19:43] <StaticSunrise> "it's fine"
[0:19:44] <%Remery_> cursed with the Lupus
[0:19:46] <$ESP_ROOT> monkaS
[0:19:46] <+SolverCODO> The secret to curses is that they only work if the victim believes in it
[0:19:48] <M4eta> she was a w(B)itch
[0:19:49] <Nina96> like the red bulls?
[0:19:55] <druvirus> What, did the witch curse you with beauty and success? oh noooo
[0:19:56] <TheShockVox> That’s when her Rich Evans fetish came to be
[0:19:56] <EASrake> Is lupus more a hex or a curse?
[0:19:57] <fearhurst> DSP is married and you aren't :)
[0:19:57] <+badchoice5> That's when you know he's 5 Redbulls and half a bag of candy deep
[0:20:01] <%Ell1ot> if Pat is too nice does that mean he did something naughty?
[0:20:05] <%ElenaManetta> A witch cursed you and then two days later, you met Pat
[0:20:06] <PlainSimpleTailor> I met a cringey satanist in high school. Shit was weird
[0:20:08] <$Ranryu692> time traveling witch curses!
[0:20:14] <%stagemage> when someone that pessimistic says its fine the statement gains power
[0:20:21] <koffeemancer> Did she hide a straw doll in your car? I heard witches do that
[0:20:24] <%ElenaManetta> "I made sure to bring 5 iPads and no glasses"
[0:20:28] <+ronim93> Will we’re get a tour?
[0:20:29] <TheShockVox> Attraction to Rich Evans was the curse
[0:20:29] <Plutt_bug> Travel setups are always jank
[0:20:29] <+SolverCODO> I actually am a witch too ope. It's not as "magical" as it sounds
[0:20:30] <$ac262> Hewrow
[0:20:34] <EASrake> I knew a girl in Highschool that talked to a demon in a crystal
[0:20:40] <dsauce999> IT'S FIIIIINNNEEE
[0:20:41] <Nina96> @PeachSaliva u gonna play ff9 ever again?
[0:20:42] <$ESP_ROOT> monkaS ...
[0:20:42] <RollCritFail> But was it a BIO CURSE?
[0:20:46] <noheartnooil> I've heard if you set the witch themself on fire then the curse goes away
[0:21:00] <medjoe> How does one say "bon appétit" in Japanese, btw? :)
[0:21:01] <+badchoice5> Wait, this isn't even Paige's full (uncursed) power?
[0:21:01] <+cafefunk> Im glad youre streaming again <3
[0:21:01] <+SolverCODO> @PeachSaliva I'll do you a big style bless
[0:21:02] <%starotter70> no its too late
[0:21:02] <+PanicSwytch> Who's gonna confiscate Pat's candy and redbulls?
[0:21:02] <%Shiroizuna> seems a lot more stable now, also hello today
[0:21:03] <%shockzndrawe> Ah shit is this the Ruby Mukbang channel
[0:21:03] <Fujiwara_92> *sneeze* you cursed now, beatch
[0:21:06] <$ESP_ROOT> did the lupus come before the curse?
[0:21:07] <%ElenaManetta> It's a self fulfilling prophecy. You're cursed because you BELIEVE you're cursed.
[0:21:09] <Viperwing999> @Viperwing999 is new here. Say hello! VoHiYo
[0:21:12] <%Remery_> The walking apocalypse
[0:21:14] <+arancet> ask pat to mail you elmo's fur in care packages, so you can eventually remake him in japan
[0:21:15] <+MonsieurHedge> dsp is some manner of space alien so
[0:21:19] <@danzig2> dsp is also a lot of things
[0:21:19] <%JackMillerTime> find a curse breaker spell
[0:21:20] <Valentinius_Anodyne> I heard that a witch's curse ends if you kill the head witch, just like vampires
[0:21:20] <%ShaneWhite> Did go into a musical like in hocus pocus
[0:21:21] <Caidezes> Skeleton marriage, when?
[0:21:22] <druvirus> No worries. I can uncurse you. But we need a new target of the curse. WHO DO WE CURSE
[0:21:22] <+ronim93> Shit, woolie got haunted though. We can undo a curse if we can create a haunt
[0:21:24] <EASrake> marraige sadly does not indicate success
[0:21:26] <randomp141> @PeachSaliva if you're actually worried put some table salt in some warm water over night for a week.
[0:21:26] <Darren716> At least you didnt have to lie about needing tax money to pay for your wedding
[0:21:29] <%shockzndrawe> What's goin on Paige
[0:21:30] <Darren716> Like DSP did
[0:21:31] <$ac262> That the guy who jerked off on stream?
[0:21:36] <+Skittlesoul> on to the story time
[0:21:36] <$ESP_ROOT> yes
[0:21:38] <garrulousAuthority> We totally failed to curse Woolie though
[0:21:39] <+GenesisPatton> Drinking? Before midnight?
[0:21:39] <%shockzndrawe> How you guys tonight
[0:21:40] <fearhurst> Yeah
[0:21:42] <+InvdrZim13> curse woolie instead
[0:21:42] <Luesagna00> @peachsaliva those authentic japanese noodles?
[0:21:44] <Nina96> whos dsp?
[0:21:46] <garrulousAuthority> We only cursed ourselves
[0:21:46] <StaticSunrise> if woolie is haunted and paige is cursed then what affliction does pat have
[0:21:48] <Viperwing999> mmm cozy strem
[0:21:51] <druvirus> Ronim, no! The last time we haunted Woolie it backfired and ended SBFP
[0:21:52] <%Remery_> he finished on stream <3
[0:21:52] <%QueequegTheater> cheer500 Don't underestimate the power of "Bitch it's fine". I had a terrible experience hanging out with some people at a music fest and my little brother (who likes to spend most of his time bitching at me) used "Why the fuck do you care about them" and brought me from the brink of tears to busting a gut laughing instantly
[0:21:56] <+ThatGuyfromMars> He beat off on stream twice, didn’t he?
[0:21:57] <Valentinius_Anodyne> Nah, we cursed Woolie so much that we all suffered for it
[0:21:58] <azure_end> Sanic.
[0:21:59] <EASrake> that
[0:22:01] <garrulousAuthority> @staticsunrise Pat has the gremlins
[0:22:04] <dsauce999> We did curse Woolie, it was just the channel was the casualty
[0:22:07] <fearhurst> I make inflammatory statements to get people to read them. People are better st seeing negativity

[0:31:54] <$ozzyzak> pat is super fucking charasmatic
[0:31:55] <%QueequegTheater> Pat's charisma is directly proportional to his level of self-destructive anger

[0:32:20] <%ceaselessdiplomacy> also there's no much thing as too makeup. if your comfortable in that amount of make up its perfect

[0:38:10] <santafer> #TeamSimba
[0:38:11] <+TheCrispyBoi> no be prepared = no buy
[0:38:12] <JackalKing> It spawned a generation of furries
[0:38:13] <%Remery_> really no Nazi Hyenas?
[0:38:13] <fearhurst> Its plot relevant
[0:38:14] <$wolfofsound> Wait are kids gonna want to fuck a real lion now?! D:
[0:38:14] <%Divryne> Judge Eyes is now Fuck Eyes.
[0:38:15] <%starotter70> thing
[0:38:16] <damascussteele> new orleans pussy is aiight
[0:38:17] <%yet_another_brony> oh yeah theres no nazi hyenas either
[0:38:18] <%Remery_> that's disappointing
[0:38:18] <+arfafax> Furries kenketO
[0:38:19] <Laironx3> "Deadpan bedroom eyes"
[0:38:20] <%QueequegTheater> Reminder that they are either cousins or half-siblings
[0:38:26] <derap41> This movie isn't going to create millions of furries that's for sure
[0:38:26] <Luesagna00> @peachsaliva the scene of simba groing up its they try too hard making it look like a life action even when its cg. like they cut the scene to make it look like they replace a diff cat thats older. so blah
[0:38:26] <fearhurst> The fuck eyes are required in the plot
[0:38:27] <+fatal_penguin_> @fingalights I live in New Mexico, MO has to be better. haha
[0:38:34] <%QueequegTheater> But it doesn't look like SCAR
[0:38:34] <%ElenaManetta> Dude, I have a hard time telling Scar apart from any other adult male lion in that trailer
[0:38:35] <%manwithboxonhead> Just the tip.
[0:38:36] <%mercado94> @JackalKing Robin Hood did it way back first
[0:38:36] <%shockzndrawe> PAIGE IS AN ANIMAL DOCTOR CONFIRMED
[0:38:47] <conflict1914> Nobody's saying they don't look like Lions, they just don't look expressive enough
[0:38:48] <a_mad_dragon> as a furry, i liked robin hood more
[0:38:49] <lizard0tm> furries: Aw shit, here we go again
[0:38:50] <+nathandiel> Wtf is in Japan
[0:38:51] <dsauce999> SCAR Aznable
[0:38:53] <$ESP_ROOT> WutFace
[0:38:53] <$KnivesEve> @PeachSaliva scar doesnt look sexy anymore he looks like a sick ugo
[0:38:55] <+nathandiel> Suicide
[0:39:00] <%QueequegTheater> IT ISN'T EVEN JEREMY IRONS
[0:39:02] <+fatmanscreaming> very curious about the duck eyes lol

[0:39:15] <derap41> The Hyenas better still be Nazis
[0:39:18] <%ninjaassassin660> brutal...
[0:39:20] <%QueequegTheater> @fatmanscreaming Google "Nala fuck-me eyes"
[0:39:21] <%Emperor_Machinus> Wear a full suit of armor
[0:39:36] <+Gatzarlok> God I looked up a picture of the new scar... with the hyena's in the background it looks like a FF cutscene.
[0:39:37] <anAngryHamster> How did you hit it twice?
[0:39:40] <mr_slaide> WE LOVE YOU, EMLO!
[0:39:41] <$ESP_ROOT> FeelsBadMan a wrecked gundam...
[0:39:45] <%mercado94> hmm?
[0:39:47] <+nathandiel> Do they have handymen in japan
[0:39:48] <fearhurst> there are thumb covers or thimbles for hammer protection
[0:39:50] <%yet_another_brony> if theres no be prepared there's probably no nazi hyenas
[0:39:50] <heroicspiritavenger> Paige needs to invest in minions
[0:39:51] <%QueequegTheater> shake it harder

[0:52:02] <santafer> I learned things about myself I rather never have known.
[0:52:03] <Scales_Tipper> I learned to hate humanity
[0:52:04] <+SubparScrub> The only things I learned were of myself
[0:52:04] <InugamiTheHound> spicy sperm
[0:52:04] <Valentinius_Anodyne> I have gained much insight
[0:52:04] <Fujiwara_92> I learned that Metal has 15"
[0:52:06] <%mercado94> does Kirby sperm can copy the powers of others?
[0:52:08] <+Pillsbury_Doughboy> i didnt know kirby had such a horseneck johnson

[0:52:20] <randomp141> @PeachSaliva It's about on par with the Sonic and Zelda love one.

[0:52:32] <%ceaselessdiplomacy> i learned humanity is worse than i thought
[0:52:32] <LordLicoriceDerp> This is deep Kirb lore, turns out his whole eldritch horror backstory was more Slaanesh than Khorne
[0:52:32] <El_Desperad0> The image of that is now burned into my brain, yet I wish to know more
[0:52:37] <$ESP_ROOT> the what monkaS ?

If you're around Kansai - Himeji might seem like a tourist-y place with a castle, but it's also a charming town to spook elementary school kids practicing English by correcting them in Japanese

[1:03:02] <natebud> I've never learned less
[1:03:03] <Caidezes> This is basically a furry smut story without OCs.

[1:03:13] <+IDTheftVictim> I'm learning existance is pain
[1:03:13] <+Kise77> This is true lore
[1:03:15] <$Kefbar> ok so i just woke up and i think i should go back to sleep xD
[1:03:15] <Niney_Who> @PeachSaliva If you want a Less-clusterfucky fanfic you could try Garfield Effect. It's Mass Effect but with GArfield instead of Shepherd

[1:03:24] <PerrinIsDead> I’m 12 what does this mean
[1:03:24] <InkyDraconian> I have learnt that a blowtorch can be used for sex
[1:03:26] <Baiuhnixg> This is so much more informative than Woolie's lore videos.
[1:03:28] <%YaBoiShamoi> YaBoiShamoi subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 8 months! Whoo 8 months!
[1:03:29] <$ESP_ROOT> monkaS

[1:03:38] <PerrinIsDead> YES
[1:03:39] <JackalKing> We need to analyze the themes of this work like an over eager high school teacher
[1:03:40] <%king_wragles> That means you have to shout the entire chapter if it's bolded.
[1:03:40] <Tiewolf> where is elmo
[1:03:44] <%salty_syd913> god i hope not
[1:03:46] <xmetalicdemonx> I'm not feeling ch2. ch1 had a direction that I could respect.

[1:03:56] <@danzig2> have woolie read it
[1:03:57] <InkyDraconian> WHY DIDN'T YOU
[1:03:58] <PlainSimpleTailor> There is no light at the end of this dank ass tunnel.
[1:03:58] <+XzileGaming> but we already do think that
[1:03:59] <EASrake> tantamount to slander
[1:04:00] <%ceaselessdiplomacy> i guess i should stay for chapter 3
