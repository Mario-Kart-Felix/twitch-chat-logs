[0:28:49] <TehMud> F
[0:28:49] <%BinaryFireball> frame is rough, paige might need to set fps limit to 60
[0:28:52] <$GarbageNirvana> Is Paige streaming on the same PC as is running the game?
[0:28:53] <+tempestzephyr> Chunky
[0:28:55] <%BinaryFireball> or what ever pat did
[0:28:55] <@Jekado> yeah i dunno why OBS?
[0:28:56] <grumblybunnys> playing 30 seconds a frame i see

[0:29:47] <+Dakuu75> that's Paige's secret, she's ALWAYS anxious
[0:29:49] <LVL1_Scumbag> Good god that framerate
[0:29:51] <TheZearGuy> Are the colors in the game really this washed out? First time seeing it. Thought was more vibrant.

[0:30:15] <brachydios777> Colors washed out is a Paige thing going on
[0:30:17] <marvel877> I bailed on responsibilities to watch this. Worth it.
[0:30:21] <jowi_time> oooh someone playin John Halo
[0:30:28] <@Jekado> the game does seem washed out too yeah?
[0:30:29] <+Reverend_Roscoe> hdr doesn't stream to twitch
[0:30:31] <@MistyMntns> Ball. Gotta Get the Ball. Ball Gotta get the Ball.
[0:30:37] <$kinghats> is this the stream frame rate or the game?
[0:30:43] <person181> oh it looks super dull color wise
[0:30:49] <CanadianAnimatorGuy> Balloon. Gotta get the Balloon.
[0:30:52] <+PrimalDweeb> Pat should know better than to ask that by now. LUL
[0:30:57] <@Jekado> because i'm looking at Fetch's game and it looks way better
[0:30:57] <brachydios777> What does chat prefer, John Halo or John Spartan, cause John Spartan is underrated
[0:31:01] <SilverFaustX> this is paige a door could kill her
[0:31:02] <valriot> Paige has HDR on but not supported LUL LUL
[0:31:04] <+Reverend_Roscoe> pat only asked because he knows already
[0:31:07] <+SaphronBlackbourne> John Halo
[0:31:10] <%JoshManVGH> Its like Battlefield Halo

[0:32:02] <%JoshManVGH> Paige does not believe in "objectives"
[0:32:03] <grumblybunnys> we're here for the commentary not the gameplay
[0:32:06] <brachydios777> *odd
[0:32:10] <bevyrage> either a lot of people are having connection issues or paige has a bad frame rate
[0:32:13] <$shurtal> Paige is 50 Cent
[0:32:17] <@Jekado> @shurtal paige's end it will get fixed after this game.

[0:35:36] <MyNameIsRasus> @KeiganOfAstora burking? is that when a giant eyeball pops out of the bowling ball, which you can hit for massive damage?

[0:45:05] <otakon17> Generation Zero stream when?
[0:45:05] <brachydios777> I really hope game modes are separate by launch
[0:45:10] <KineticZen> Next slide please
[0:45:11] <missingangle> Does that mean WE'RE voices in Paige's head?
[0:45:17] <SilverFaustX> fps is still bad
[0:45:19] <otakon17> Paige dang it you died aGAIN
[0:45:24] <otakon17> the FPS is fine
[0:45:31] <SilverFaustX> it froze
[0:45:31] <otakon17> wait no it's dropping
[0:45:37] <%AncelDeLambert> oh, not just meL
[0:45:38] <otakon17> but that might be the connection
[0:45:39] <%Visorak6> Im unsure
[0:45:39] <$NitronStreams> fps is better but we getting drops
[0:45:40] <+cmdrmobium> paige you ran past the ball
[0:45:41] <brachydios777> Oh
[0:45:43] <eyeobject> I imagine paige has a fisher price toy keyboard while Pat does the complicated stuff
[0:45:46] <%AncelDeLambert> Twitch suuuuuuucks, dangit
[0:45:46] <%Ranryu692> nice 57 fps
[0:45:51] <%JoshManVGH> She walked right by it
[0:45:52] <%AncelDeLambert> she desires MURDER
[0:45:55] <+Freakin_Wolfy> have they considered only playing with a party of 3 so SOMEONE is competent?
[0:45:56] <MyNameIsRasus> Wow
[0:46:04] <SilverFaustX> could be twitch
[0:46:07] <otakon17> yeah the stream is apparently running a good 60fps
[0:46:13] <otakon17> so it's not twitch
[0:46:19] <brachydios777> AR is really good in this Halo
[0:46:21] <pokefan9956> @peachsaliva , switch to your pistol. it's really good
[0:46:28] <otakon17> they railroaded you Paige it happens
[0:46:29] <EynoStiles> Is friendly fire on?
[0:46:32] <AMajorTom> Whe shooting, aim at the enemy
[0:46:33] <nephets_stein> Can I play with you paige
[0:46:33] <%AncelDeLambert> it's amazng how much better that pistol is
[0:46:36] <%Visorak6> somewhat
[0:46:38] <MyNameIsRasus> kind of but not really
[0:46:39] <+Freakin_Wolfy> @pokefan9956 the pistol only has a slightly higher TTK if you hit your shots
[0:46:41] <+cmdrmobium> A little better but still choppy
[0:46:41] <SilverFaustX> its still laggy
[0:46:42] <marvel877> kinda.
[0:46:43] <%BinaryFireball> its a bit better
[0:46:45] <$NitronStreams> better but with big drops
[0:46:45] <otakon17> I think the game has issues being streamed?
[0:46:45] <Explodincatz> not really
[0:46:46] <%Ranryu692> "better" is sujective
[0:46:48] <brachydios777> Lil bit
[0:46:50] <%Ranryu692> *subjective
[0:46:53] <%JoshManVGH> Still a tad choppy but much better overall
[0:47:02] <%endyfilter> you might need to just turn down the quality of the game
[0:47:05] <otakon17> yeah with some BIG drops so far
[0:47:10] <%Visorak6> yeah wifi would do it
[0:47:10] <%jolene_orenji> peach the WIFI WARRIOR
[0:47:10] <@MistyMntns> It looks fine to me
[0:47:12] <%JoshManVGH> Wifi Warrior!?
[0:47:13] <SilverFaustX> on wifi ? DansGame
[0:47:18] <otakon17> that would do it
[0:47:19] <+OrangeMDT> It’s like 25 frames or something
[0:47:19] <otakon17> YOU'RE ON WIFI!?
[0:47:21] <ToneBacas> she's not on wifi is she?
[0:47:25] <eyeobject> Gotta adjust the orb
[0:47:25] <brachydios777> There is an option for performance perfered I think
[0:47:28] <+barrakuta371> capping the frame rate to 60 might help
[0:47:28] <nephets_stein> Oof
[0:47:32] <+Freakin_Wolfy> why would you stream on Wifi?
[0:47:33] <MyNameIsRasus> The framerate is worse than your kda
[0:47:34] <%JoshManVGH> LUL
[0:47:34] <otakon17> no wonder you're getting your butt kicked
[0:47:36] <ToneBacas> yeah that's the problem
[0:47:37] <otakon17> WiFi in MP is HORRID
[0:47:39] <valerios_> haHAA
[0:47:40] <EynoStiles> Paige, you have to cover when you are being shot at
[0:47:42] <+OrangeMDT> I can’t believe Pat is with a Wi-Fi warrior
[0:47:43] <otakon17> PLUG IT IN
[0:47:43] <$GarbageNirvana> Fuckin...pay me the plane ticket and I'll install it
[0:47:43] <+Freakin_Wolfy> "Installing" an ethernet cable hahahahahahahahahaha
[0:47:44] <+Whiskey_T_Foxtrot> he means, you keep putting off telling pat to install it
[0:47:45] <pokefan9956> WHY. IT TAKES TWO SECONDS
[0:47:46] <Explodincatz> jesus Paige
[0:47:50] <ToneBacas> i mean that could be a problem. i can see why it would look like that
[0:47:51] <otakon17> FOR THE LOVE OF GOD PLUG IT IN
[0:47:52] <brachydios777> Plug it in like an EVA
[0:47:59] <%AncelDeLambert> Paige "Han Solo" Saliva. "It's not my fault"
[0:47:59] <otakon17> LET THE GINGER MINIMAN INSTALL IT
[0:48:04] <$NitronStreams> I have a 1050ti and in order to capture halo I need to put it a low and limit the fps to 30
[0:48:05] <MyNameIsRasus> ethernet cables are blue now
[0:48:05] <+OfficioPrefectusCorgi> Clearly its the Cable fault
[0:48:07] <+CopperTucker> that sounds right
[0:48:07] <%JimmyRuss> JimmyRuss subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 21 months! aaaaaaaaaa
[0:48:07] <eyeobject> I'M the problem...YOU'RE the problem
[0:48:08] <otakon17> you are running on EMERGENCY POWER
[0:48:09] <cs0402196> paige is erasing her memories so she doesn't lie
[0:48:16] <CrimsonFox777> You see that? That's the power of a Wifi Warrior.
[0:48:21] <otakon17> I wish I had an Ethernet cable
[0:48:21] <EynoStiles> Paige always get shot when she reloads
[0:48:23] <%AncelDeLambert> does ANYONE like Oddball?
[0:48:34] <otakon17> Oddball sucks without good friends playing
[0:48:36] <person181> as if paige could remember her lies
[0:48:36] <graemecrackers2> so rude
[0:48:36] <pokefan9956> Paige. take a break and plug in the ethernet
[0:48:44] <%Ranryu692> I liked it in 3
[0:48:46] <+DrFacilier> Oddball is better than CTF
[0:48:48] <%JoshManVGH> I like oddball... but not every game
[0:48:49] <otakon17> Paiges phrase of the day: Oh tits!
[0:48:49] <$GarbageNirvana> I prefer Grifball
[0:48:49] <%polothegreatest> No juice for multitasking halo+stream LUL
[0:48:54] <TallYoda08> I do ):
[0:48:57] <+GinAndRoses> every 25 or so games it's a nice change of pace
[0:48:57] <%AncelDeLambert> untrue, CTF is tonsa fun
[0:48:59] <TallYoda08> :(
[0:49:02] <%JoshManVGH> @drfacilier Facts
[0:49:02] <%Aleate> oddball is better than 1 flag
[0:49:03] <MyNameIsRasus> Didn't know Halo released for the powerpoint
[0:49:06] <+Dakuu75> I felt like this game got WAY harder in ALL modes/aspects after I did my rank placement.
[0:49:09] <%BinaryFireball> am I weird that I think all modes feel the same?
[0:49:09] <otakon17> Griffball is the best ball
[0:49:12] <+badhaye> lets get griff ball back
[0:49:12] <+ImExtremelyManly> shes doing it
[0:49:13] <%SharkMissile> SharkMissile subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 15 months, currently on a 5 month streak! Jane Halo, sister of John Halo
[0:49:14] <brachydios777> Oddball has never been Halo fans’ favorite
[0:49:19] <%polothegreatest> het oddball is fun OSFrog
[0:49:22] <otakon17> >hide
[0:49:22] <+GinAndRoses> spooky man!
[0:49:23] <EynoStiles> she was jumping too.
[0:49:24] <person181> "i'm trying to HIDE" *keeps jumping*
[0:49:26] <otakon17> >running in a straight line
[0:49:35] <otakon17> zig zag!
[0:49:36] <%JoshManVGH> Griffball was good times
[0:49:39] <+BlowFireThroatTotem> is it true that emlo is essentially a baby with a gun?
[0:49:43] <otakon17> yes
[0:49:46] <MyNameIsRasus> Paige you said you were kinda good on twitter
[0:49:49] <otakon17> Elmo is a baby
[0:49:51] <%SharkMissile> Pure Joy
[0:49:51] <brachydios777> I can’t wait for griffball in this
[0:49:54] <AMajorTom> It’s called Hiding in plain sight, Pat-tuh
[0:49:54] <+Dakuu75> it sucks that getting shot kills your zoom. I've never played a game like that
[0:49:55] <otakon17> the gun is optional
[0:49:58] <+ImExtremelyManly> football
[0:49:58] <%jolene_orenji> griffball is basically soccer with gravity hammers and swords
[0:49:59] <%polothegreatest> Soccer with hammer
[0:49:59] <otakon17> Griffball!
[0:49:59] <+badhaye> griff ball was basically rugby with gravity hammers
[0:50:00] <$NitronStreams> Grifball is Halo Footbal
[0:50:01] <werewombatx> gravity hammer soccer
[0:50:02] <EscoSul> gief ball?
[0:50:04] <EynoStiles> Poor paige, she tries her best. lol
[0:50:05] <+gitgouda> i miss griff ball
[0:50:05] <otakon17> it's the best
[0:50:06] <+ImExtremelyManly> with hammer
[0:50:07] <bravebravesrobin> did he have a plan, this man?
[0:50:08] <+Ne1son> Grif ball is the best
[0:50:10] <%JoshManVGH> One person is the griff with super speed. the opposing team has hammers
[0:50:15] <marvel877> soccer or rugby but with grav hammers
[0:50:19] <%superc37> @peachsaliva and energy swords
[0:50:21] <otakon17> ...foxes don't go woof
[0:50:24] <brachydios777> Two side with hammers, deliver the bomb in the other team’s goal
[0:50:26] <+OrangeMDT> Your rooster overlords made griffball
[0:50:34] <%jolene_orenji> also the rugby ball explodes when you score with it (that is IMPORTANT)
[0:50:38] <CrimsonFox777> @otakon17 Then what does the fox say?
[0:50:40] <+BigCoffee> FarFetch is a girl?!
[0:50:41] <+Freakin_Wolfy> Can you imagine someone in real life being so discombobulated as paige is in game?
[0:50:49] <otakon17> @CrimsonFox777 yip usually
[0:50:50] <%SharkMissile> Shouldn't his name be...PatShootsAt? *smug*
[0:50:50] <notgarza> LMAO
[0:50:55] <%polothegreatest> shame RVB is ded
[0:50:55] <%superc37> oh and whoevers holding the ball turns into griff
[0:51:01] <brachydios777> Griffball is a blast
[0:51:03] <otakon17> @Freakin_Wolfy I have been there it's not fun
[0:51:03] <%JoshManVGH> @bigcoffee No, FarFetched is birb
[0:51:09] <MyNameIsRasus> @CrimsonFox777 i don't know, why don't you tell us, mr. fox?
[0:51:14] <+Freakin_Wolfy> @otakon17 it's a miracle you're alive
[0:51:14] <EynoStiles> Paige is clearly a melee fighter. get this lady a sword
[0:51:14] <%polothegreatest> sofarfIQ sofarfIQ
[0:51:15] <%AncelDeLambert> Fetch a tweetiebird
[0:51:17] <+BigCoffee> @JoshManVGH You're right
[0:51:30] <%SharkMissile> @notagoodname10 wtf
[0:51:31] <brachydios777> Griffball has been around since Halo 3
[0:51:44] <otakon17> @Freakin_Wolfy I said I KNOW, it's happened when I was sick out of my gourd and high on every cough medicine known to man

[0:52:00] <pokefan9956> can we get Ethernet BibleThump
[0:52:03] <brachydios777> Though I think it wasn’t an official playlist till Reach
[0:52:11] <%JoshManVGH> Pat is the world's biggest Halo fan not the worlds biggest Halo 3 fan.
[0:52:12] <otakon17> I'd quit playing after getting a mudhole that big stomped in me

[0:54:03] <+PrimalDweeb> You should be good to go now.
[0:54:05] <$SirGO0SE> 1080 good
[0:54:06] <$NitronStreams> 1440 is not 4k
[0:54:06] <@SoFarFetched> because 4K like 4K gold geefTux
[0:54:12] <ToneBacas> hey i have that GPU too
[0:54:13] <EynoStiles> I am just waiting for the day Paige expose her Payparus porn on the desktop.
[0:54:15] <WhereIsWill> ayy we got the same GPU
[0:54:15] <SilverFaustX> 1440 is 2k
[0:54:23] <+PrimalDweeb> Should help a lot. LUL
[0:54:24] <%SharkMissile> Nooooooooooooooo
[0:54:24] <otakon17> okay that's still too high for streaming
[0:54:27] <+Freakin_Wolfy> have they tried ranked yet?
[0:54:28] <RaizD> it's not 2k either
[0:54:29] <%AncelDeLambert> there is no way not to get it, that's why this game currently SUCKS
[0:54:31] <$RealThiele> rng be kind
[0:54:37] <otakon17> inb4 you get oddball again

[0:54:45] <otakon17> RNG modes are stupid
[0:54:48] <%AncelDeLambert> like, hardcore I don't want to play this right now because of being forced into modes I hate
[0:54:48] <$SirGO0SE> 1080 is standard should be good
[0:54:54] <brachydios777> I hope it’s just a beta thing
[0:55:00] <$RealThiele> 1-800 ABCDEFG
[0:55:02] <Samex_Comex> plagueWave
[0:55:04] <otakon17> no 1080p should be FINE for streaming
[0:55:05] <$NitronStreams> btb doesnt have oddball by the way
[0:55:07] <TallYoda08> Oddball is ok
[0:55:09] <%polothegreatest> Those Spartans are looking for cake LUL
[0:55:13] <otakon17> 1440 is too high for streaming

[0:55:34] <@MistyMntns> Boom
[0:55:37] <otakon17> has he been pondering it?
[0:55:38] <nocturnPhoenix> Same. Until mode-specific playlists are in (or at the very least we get a few more targeted playlists) I can
[0:55:38] <+demon1103> how dare you want to choose a mode!!! just for that...5 oddballs in a row for you!!!! MUAHAHAHA -343, probably
[0:55:41] <brachydios777> @polothegreatest If you want cake you look at Spartans in Reach
[0:55:41] <scrambledxeggz> Paige's computer = big bonkers
[0:55:42] <nocturnPhoenix> I can't get the motivation to play

[0:57:21] <%JoshManVGH> Give it many power
[0:57:22] <otakon17> no major drops now
[0:57:28] <$NitronStreams> wait what gpu does paiges computer have in it?
[0:57:28] <kektzalcoatl> will the 2080 even help if its a cpu bound game?
[0:57:28] <$SirGO0SE> looks better than Pats stream Kappa
[0:57:31] <otakon17> Oh tits count: 5
[0:57:33] <+Freakin_Wolfy> "Please protect me" while all three are dead on the flag
[0:57:35] <%AncelDeLambert> kill enemy and stand on flag to go back
[0:57:39] <churropoppa> @otakon17 you can zoom with pretty much all the weapons
[0:57:40] <RaizD> the 5700xt is good, but not great for streaming tho
[0:57:44] <otakon17> I have a 2060 Super myself
[0:57:49] <otakon17> I'm pretty happy with it

[0:58:14] <$RealThiele> $800 for a 2060 atm just makes me cringe
[0:58:22] <%jolene_orenji> since you're in a 4 player party you're gonna be matched against people who are actually like communicating and stuff
[0:58:26] <otakon17> like I said, lucky I got it when I did

[1:00:37] <TheHeroAppears> paige you are crazy
[1:00:39] <%Sotetsu> Pat is man-splaining the flag. sofarfBomb
[1:00:39] <otakon17> THAT IS WHERE YOUR FLAG IS
[1:00:40] <%superc37> no youre crazy
[1:00:42] <%AncelDeLambert> if the enemy isn't running and is crouching you can't see the flag
[1:00:53] <brachydios777> You are always blue team
[1:00:53] <Melchior_the_Wise> plague, Pat, Paige, and who else is playing?
[1:01:01] <+Freakin_Wolfy> @AncelDeLambert it actually only reveals them if they're sprinting
[1:01:05] <%JoshManVGH> They are behind their flag point
[1:01:05] <ToneBacas> this is like ADHD Requiem. no offense
[1:01:07] <bosssbatttle> why are they just hiding the flag lmao
[1:01:08] <EscoSul> if paige doesn't know what she's doing neither will the enemy!
[1:01:12] <Mattais88> both teams bunkering down with the others flag
[1:01:15] <%strakillias> I want to point out that they are fighting bots
[1:01:17] <$RealThiele> turtling the flag while you send out killers
[1:01:19] <otakon17> they're all at their spanw
[1:01:27] <%Sotetsu> You were trying to kill Pat with the flag, Paige
[1:01:31] <otakon17> @strakillias it's PAIGE what do you expect?
[1:01:37] <pokefan9956> wait. these are bots?

[1:02:01] <+JGardner03> You threw a grenade, are you hitting that button by mistake lol
[1:02:02] <+PrimalDweeb> Remember grenades!
[1:02:06] <+Freakin_Wolfy> @bosssbatttle because they can't score while their flag is away. What else would they do?
[1:02:13] <otakon17> you gotta stop jerking the thumbstick
[1:02:14] <$NitronStreams> yeah melee is not 100% in this one its wierd
[1:02:15] <BoxNavy> flagback
[1:02:18] <%SharkMissile> @pokefan9956 Any name that starts with 343 is a bot, when someone leaves a game they're usually replaced with a bot. :)
[1:02:19] <+cmdrmobium> 2 bots on their team
[1:02:33] <otakon17> they're losing to mostly bots
[1:02:33] <+PrimalDweeb> That's not... Never mind. LUL
[1:02:51] <otakon17> GO AFTER THE PERSON MARKED WITH KILL PAIGE!
[1:02:56] <%jolene_orenji> @SharkMissile gonna put 343 in front of my name to throw people off
[1:02:57] <Melchior_the_Wise> anime girls should be good with guns
[1:03:03] <%Shotgun_Hobo1> I like how Paige plays like a tank, she either stops or moves in one direction while shooting
[1:03:03] <BoxNavy> monkaS !
[1:03:09] <TourettesPlays> Paige n Pat give big hug to Gief I had to put my dog to sleep today

[1:03:56] <otakon17> I dunno, the AI for the campaign manages to kick your ass on higher difficulties
[1:03:58] <brachydios777> @anceldelambert It’s basically a shotgun
[1:04:04] <+Solid_Stro> c4sageLUL
[1:04:04] <%jolene_orenji> @otakon17 that's because they cheat
[1:04:05] <%SharkMissile> yeyey
[1:04:09] <$NitronStreams> You did it
[1:04:14] <%AncelDeLambert> except it isn't, it's a slug fire with drop-off
[1:04:18] <+Freakin_Wolfy> How the heck are they coming back????
[1:04:32] <%jolene_orenji> @brachydios777 nah it was a shotgun in the old games but in this one it's a higher damage projectile pistol
[1:04:42] <%SharkMissile> @Freakin_Wolfy I think the A.I. might have adaptive difficulty? I'm not sure yet.
[1:04:47] <Melchior_the_Wise> CAPTURE IT
[1:04:55] <%Sotetsu> You're doing it, Paiger!
[1:04:56] <%strakillias> We started talking shit about the bots and they IMMEDIATELY win
[1:04:56] <eyeobject> Paig is big and strong and she do good jorb
[1:04:58] <brachydios777> @anceldelambert I mean in terms of it’s useless unless your close
[1:05:01] <+Freakin_Wolfy> @SharkMissile I don't think the AI can do THAT badly

[1:05:41] <BoxNavy> moon2W
[1:05:43] <RaizD> yep
[1:05:46] <+Freakin_Wolfy> She tried to score by meleeing her own flag
[1:05:46] <brachydios777> Yes
[1:05:49] <+TheSlackaholic> @AncelDeLambert Halo aim is so simple though, especially since most people jump when fighitng up close like total morons making them even easier to track
[1:05:52] <tanarath> Run over the flag
[1:05:54] <missingangle> Thank you, Jesus
[1:05:56] <%jolene_orenji> GOD LIKED Y'ALL BETTER
[1:05:57] <Melchior_the_Wise> Prayer works
[1:05:57] <Gehtingsberg> jesus saves
[1:06:02] <%JoshManVGH> Teamwork makes the dreamwork
[1:06:03] <+GinAndRoses> bots can't pray
[1:06:10] <%Kurgash> Like doom guy, just punch it
[1:06:15] <%Sotetsu> Hooray!

[1:06:34] <eyeobject> Punch flag. Win game.
[1:06:36] <+Freakin_Wolfy> This game is the REAL dark souls for paige
[1:06:39] <brachydios777> @ginandroses Clearly you don’t know about our lord and savior the omniseiah
[1:06:50] <otakon17> ALL HAIL THE MANPEROR!
[1:06:51] <+TheSlackaholic> @PeachSaliva at least you picked one of the easier FPS games to learn with
[1:06:51] <TheHeroAppears> use a controller
[1:06:54] <BoxNavy> play game
[1:06:54] <otakon17> *STOMP STOMP*
[1:06:58] <%JoshManVGH> Punch flag to stick it to the noobs
[1:07:02] <%polothegreatest> HACKS
[1:07:05] <%AncelDeLambert> practice and booze
[1:07:11] <BoxNavy> you get better at game when you play game :)
[1:07:11] <cherrycottontail> you also have to set your sensitivity really low
[1:07:12] <%jolene_orenji> pro tip: to get good at fps games, just click on the enemies heads and don't let them click on yours :)
[1:07:12] <ToneBacas> and the lag comes back
[1:07:15] <otakon17> it's all practice
[1:07:16] <+cmdrmobium> rip fps
[1:07:21] <$NitronStreams> Stand in the glowy square until its blue
[1:07:23] <otakon17> FPS is dropping for some reason
[1:07:24] <Coystick> So when's Peach changing her name to Jane Halo?
[1:07:26] <%MrBorisMakarov> fps again

[1:07:42] <brachydios777> What happened with the frames?
[1:07:48] <otakon17> ACQUIRE IT
[1:07:51] <+TheSlackaholic> @jolene_orenji the most skilled FPS games don't have area damage though
[1:07:51] <%TheotherKristian> Oh I love me some 12 fps
[1:07:56] <ValkahRoctsteel> Ou yeah count them frames
[1:07:58] <%AncelDeLambert> spray and pray, the eternal tactic
[1:08:01] <marvel877> Is this an N64 game?
[1:08:02] <+TheSlackaholic> @jolene_orenji shot in the foot does same damage as shot in the face
[1:08:03] <%polothegreatest> so it wasnt just me huh
[1:08:05] <otakon17> man this is some Killzone action right now
[1:08:08] <%MrBorisMakarov> yes
[1:08:10] <%JoshManVGH> A tad
[1:08:13] <$RealThiele> big Kronch
[1:08:14] <Melchior_the_Wise> CRONCH
[1:08:17] <RaizD> is the stream cronchy for anyone else?
[1:08:17] <otakon17> it must be Twitch
[1:08:19] <brachydios777> Paige requires additional cables
[1:08:20] <TheTakkster> This a slideshow for everyone?
[1:08:22] <%AncelDeLambert> someone give this poor woman the hammer
[1:08:24] <otakon17> bc Paige is playing fine
[1:08:32] <marvel877> Its a slideshow, yeah.
[1:08:33] <%polothegreatest> Switch version halo LUL
[1:08:34] <%jolene_orenji> @TheSlackaholic I'm pretty sure halo has area damage and it has the whole "kill your opponents with a precision weapon headshot" thing
[1:08:35] <$RealThiele> aim assist
[1:08:36] <Melchior_the_Wise> BLess
[1:08:37] <+TheSlackaholic> @PeachSaliva use ESDF instead of WASD
[1:08:45] <otakon17> KEYBOARD?!
[1:08:45] <%JoshManVGH> Gasundtite
[1:08:49] <+TheSlackaholic> @RealThiele aim cheat, call it what it is
[1:08:52] <pokefan9956> somebody call woolie in for the Ethernet talk
[1:08:54] <$RealThiele> BIG cheat
[1:08:55] <otakon17> bless you
[1:08:55] <+ImExtremelyManly> try the woolie method
[1:08:56] <%AncelDeLambert> yep, there goes the framerate
[1:09:01] <%Kurgash> Who are these other strange voices? I recognize plague
[1:09:10] <Explodincatz> its like 1998 never left
[1:09:12] <%AncelDeLambert> that's Farfetched talking right now
[1:09:14] <otakon17> playback bitrate is like, 7mb
[1:09:15] <Reveresao> is the framerate a bad for anyone else?
[1:09:18] <otakon17> it's Twitch
[1:09:19] <%jolene_orenji> @Kurgash pat, plague, and farfetched
[1:09:21] <ToneBacas> kick stream framerate down to 30, and/or lower stream resolution down to 720p if you really need to
[1:09:26] <$cooldude69xx> @Kurgash I think the other guy is... Pet? Pot? Something like that
[1:09:26] <%Kurgash> Ahh ok.
[1:09:27] <+demon1103> woooh, slideshow stream time XD
[1:09:28] <@Jekado> @Kurgash SoFarfetched and PatStaresAt.

[1:09:42] <BoxNavy> who can say
[1:09:43] <brachydios777> Paige hasn’t been praying enough to her PC’s machine spirit
[1:09:46] <%TreeVoidYT> TreeVoidYT subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 42 months! 
[1:09:51] <pokefan9956> plug in the ethernet lol
[1:09:51] <marvel877> It might be both. I'm sorry, BOLTH, as Paige would say.
[1:09:55] <+Bailey__Gaming> hello today paige
[1:09:56] <otakon17> I think it's Twitch
[1:10:02] <otakon17> bc you seem to be playing just fiine
[1:10:08] <otakon17> you're not complaining it's choppy
[1:10:10] <%AncelDeLambert> Paige is dodging bullets just like she dodges DBD Killers. With lots of hope
[1:10:10] <+TheSlackaholic> @brachydios777 well, prayer is more or less one of the most useless concepts mankind has ever come up with
[1:10:20] <+demon1103> @brachydios777  she needs to do some hyms with incense burning around her PC
[1:10:24] <otakon17> Oh tits count: 8
[1:10:37] <otakon17> call the techpriests!
[1:10:38] <%hewlettfan96> Booobies

[1:14:13] <luftraumm1> is gamepad out of the question?
[1:14:13] <%JoshManVGH> That laser was powerful
[1:14:15] <%AncelDeLambert> this is why I always map melee and grenades to my mouse thumb buttons
[1:14:18] <+Bailey__Gaming> I always Bind melee to a side mouse button
[1:14:23] <+SergeEXE> @AncelDeLambert pjdNice
[1:14:28] <+cmdrmobium> This map has a bunch of fancy lighting that's killing the pc
[1:14:37] <%Sotetsu> Clearly the opposing team is cheating.
[1:14:41] <%Shotgun_Hobo1> Let Paige play controller so she can have the real John Halo experience
[1:14:45] <jetpack_rorschasch> SeemsGood
[1:14:55] <allgorerhythm> "we're doing really we-oh shit"

[1:15:47] <TheCrispyBoi> yes
[1:15:48] <+SaphronBlackbourne> Quite badde
[1:15:50] <+WeLucklessJacks> Dear lord yes.
[1:15:54] <sashagreenspiderqueen> its pretty bad yeah like 10 fps
[1:16:02] <allgorerhythm> how doggy are we talking?

[1:16:06] <Spydurman> ya
[1:16:14] <Spydurman> we're at like 10-15 fps
[1:16:19] <$NitronStreams> yeah this whole match is like 10 fps for some reason
[1:16:22] <%JoshManVGH> It's a nice picturebook framerate
[1:16:24] <brachydios777> @realthiele Frames:”so let me get this straight, the boss took some sort of risk, and I’m supposed to give a shit? Hey boys, we are going on a 5 hour lunch!”
[1:16:25] <Neri011> Sadly yeah, it's pretty chunky
[1:16:26] <+Bailey__Gaming> spookymans
[1:16:27] <sleepystardewfarmer> it's fun enough just getting to listen to you guys :)
[1:16:36] <$RealThiele> LUL
[1:16:39] <mr_saturday93> new  map out in dbd
[1:16:41] <%FingaLights> The human eye can only see 12fps
[1:16:47] <luftraumm1> plague would for sure have more fun
[1:16:51] <Ghufufin> clearly the stream drops a frame every time paige dies
[1:16:51] <%Nordguy> it would be for the best ;p
[1:16:53] <Azathotic> @PeachSaliva Halo Infinite is badly optimized for PC
[1:16:54] <+SergeEXE> 60fps is the highest fps there is
[1:16:58] <+spleekle> yeah now its back to fine
[1:17:21] <+spleekle> Halo and Anime dont mix apparently
[1:17:25] <%JoshManVGH> S'alright
[1:17:28] <%polothegreatest> you need a new computer for work LUL
[1:17:31] <valerios_> ooof
[1:17:32] <brachydios777> F to fox
[1:17:38] <+PrimalDweeb> F to Halo
[1:17:45] <$GarbageNirvana> This game does seem incredibly resource intensive
[1:17:50] <$NitronStreams> Halo wants ALL of your PC
[1:17:52] <$GarbageNirvana> Which tells me my laptop's not gonna be able to run it for jack
[1:17:58] <%strakillias> It's OK Paige, we didn't come here to watch Halo. We came to listen to you scream TITS and OH CHRST
[1:17:59] <%Nordguy> let's dead it up Babyyyyyyyyyyy
[1:18:05] <+PrimalDweeb> It's all good Paige, we're here for you!
[1:18:07] <%FingaLights> Its all the bit mining
[1:18:12] <brachydios777> Oh ok
[1:18:14] <Dannzzyy> Why is halo so demanding to run?
[1:18:19] <AyotoCorp> I just opened OBS and I ALSO have frames missed due to rendering lag, but I'm literally just running Chrome
[1:18:24] <+Sendrak70> Anyone elses hearing the music super distroted?

[1:26:16] <%QueequegTheater> @PeachSaliva I like the story. Skip 5 though.
[1:26:16] <brachydios777> Halo 4 is underrated
[1:26:20] <%JoshManVGH> The ton of lore came in a preorder bonus in reach.
[1:26:27] <person181> "i should play the bible"- thing i thought she'd say for some reason

[1:27:06] <KellBeII> the actual game is not very religous
[1:27:06] <jetpack_rorschasch> BECAUSE HE'S YOUR LORD AND SAVIOUR PAT!

[1:30:24] <%Shotgun_Hobo1> Optimus Prime is the best of the Jesuses
[1:30:28] <%Sotetsu> Maybe don't heal near the gen, because it is a bird target?
[1:30:40] <$TheNewZealandStory> @President_Pariah they hurt you if you take a direct hit within 20 meters
[1:30:45] <brachydios777> @thicc_or_treat_ John is more cyborg Jesus

[1:31:35] <$TheNewZealandStory> you cant loop her at all
[1:31:41] <%Aleate> If you run into the bird you get bird, if you already have bird and run into bird you get damage.
[1:32:08] <brachydios777> Is Ang a Jesus?
[1:32:10] <President_Pariah> if you get hit by the bird directly in close range you take damage too
[1:32:10] <+Felhad> Shes basically Nemesis with a lot more range
[1:32:21] <%Sotetsu> Pop!
[1:32:23] <MrMatternot> Aang no is Jesus.
[1:32:30] <%Shotgun_Hobo1> @brachydios777 He died for our sins and to sell new toys
[1:32:31] <%polothegreatest> Avatars are jesus, yes
[1:32:34] <%JoshManVGH> @brachydios777 No but he might be John Galt.
[1:32:39] <Luizabd> @Aleate Thats not how they work anymore you cant be damaged by an idle crow
[1:32:47] <%QueequegTheater> Aang is literally the savior of the world who came back from the dead, he's clearly a Jesus
[1:32:50] <%Aleate> @Luizabd Oh really? Thats nice at least.
[1:33:12] <MrMatternot> Aang is Salvador Dali Lamma
[1:33:25] <Make_me_mad> Shepard is clearly the space jesus.

[1:36:16] <Make_me_mad> Samus isn't a jesus. She's too cool for that.
