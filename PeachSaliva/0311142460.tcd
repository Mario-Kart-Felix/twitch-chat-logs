[1:06:55] <%konekoryugamine> @Admiral_PopnFresh They're pretty fun
[1:06:55] <+VideoVillain20> Theyre right but still wrong

[1:06:58] <rytisone> in Hell
[1:06:59] <%krawtch> @SGrim my strategy of gaining 45 lbs to go from a 32x38 to a 36x38 has worked, but also not
[1:06:59] <+moranprime> I remember
[1:07:00] <%generalve> pat keep reading
[1:07:01] <Prevot> "cause japan" it's a fuckin SNES game
[1:07:02] <crimsonharvest> I read the Nintendo Power with this on the cover like 200 times until it literally fell apart.
[1:07:04] <%konekoryugamine> @Admiral_PopnFresh Play Tactics
[1:07:04] <averagehero1> it's not emulated it's on its original system... Kappa
[1:07:07] <$sylphyyyy> Looks like the GBA version
[1:07:15] <+skizzuto> on your way to Baron, I think
[1:07:15] <+Punisher7771> blows cartrage
[1:07:15] <$sylphyyyy> So maybe better translation
[1:07:16] <$mister___doctor> Final Fantasy Four? More like Final Fantasy FOR Nerds!!! Yeah! Get fucked!
[1:07:16] <Cthulos> Okay, thanks for clarifying that this is the good FF4

[1:08:44] <SGrim> @haxxarator yes
[1:08:44] <Thirtine> @Bouldus oh yeah, pat's super short - its just funny to think about people i watch stream being shorter/taller than me.
[1:08:48] <pillowwasp> The concept of random encounters sure aged well...
[1:08:48] <treybivins> NOTHING WILL STAND IN MY WAY
[1:08:49] <$GohanEgret> SVU is the goat
[1:08:50] <Zantetzuken> sounds fine here
[1:08:50] <%konekoryugamine> Freakazoid is the BEST
[1:08:51] <Zansatsu0379> So Pat, you're making Matt play DMC2 right?
[1:08:51] <Huntercd> SVU got too dark for me
[1:08:51] <Firesparks> "sweet"
[1:08:53] <%Dingalow> Go home, gamer girl!
[1:08:55] <outis94> formulaic
[1:08:57] <treybivins> "Wanna go out for a mint?"
[1:08:58] <$OlCaptainRed> SVU is great
[1:08:58] <Endocrom> Formulaic is the word you are looking for
[1:08:58] <thelonechris> It's better than Brave New World expansion
[1:08:59] <+Punisher7771> ncsi is better
[1:09:00] <$OlCaptainRed> CI is bad
[1:09:00] <+Skatedeandre> SVU is timeless
[1:09:02] <Paralurx> Law & Order is bad
[1:09:02] <+mgskomododragon> Special victims units is Bad
[1:09:04] <%SulfurousAcid> Law & Order may be dumb but it isn't bad
[1:09:04] <topendbuzz> svu is quite dark
[1:09:05] <Dr_Donkey_Brains> SVU is the worst though
[1:09:08] <WisdomHat> I don't like flowers
[1:09:10] <TheyCallMeVawn> I dont like breathing air
[1:09:10] <denam_of_windscale> @thewisewolf that shit was fucking insane to watch
[1:09:12] <side_effect> Law & Order is good in some eras... SVU is both dumb and bad
[1:09:12] <$jorgamund> a Canadian watching a procedural about a foreign country's legal system?
[1:09:12] <ludwigvonholyblade> is that the one with "go home gamer girl"?
[1:09:16] <+Chimeraelite> brain fart
[1:09:16] <averagehero1> SVU was weird with the few epsidoe I saw.
[1:09:17] <%Mekhet09> The story lines are bad.
[1:09:17] <Admiral_PopnFresh> flowers are stinky
[1:09:17] <violetheart> You can do it, Pat.
[1:09:18] <Worldbrand> I dont like the smesh
[1:09:18] <Firesparks> "another murder, SWEET"

[1:09:22] <%swordsman70> Are you OK Pat?
[1:09:25] <topendbuzz> svu is the best and the worst

[1:09:29] <$GohanEgret> chris meloni
[1:09:29] <Firesparks> paige love svu
[1:09:33] <Zantetzuken> ice t is a national treasure
[1:09:33] <%krawtch> Law & Order is a content bingers nightmare because you could die of old age before you get through 2/3 of it
[1:09:34] <haxxarator> what about NCIS?
[1:09:36] <+oKentucky> lmfao elliot spitzer

[1:09:47] <mpm5585> SVU is my life
[1:09:48] <$thewhiterice92> I love Ice T but he's gotta stop being surprised at weird sex perverts
[1:09:48] <Zola390> SVU is just Rape of the week.

[1:10:08] <shadowgilgamesh> "This is better than civ 5 with the brave new world expansion"
[1:10:11] <+Jpdodds> Like when someone eats too much chocolate cake?
[1:10:11] <PakuV2> Ice Cube plays Civ 6
[1:10:13] <+JoeStillLife> LUL
[1:10:13] <%konekoryugamine> I live to serve XD
[1:10:14] <$OlCaptainRed> yeah but Ice T explains all the DRUGS
[1:10:15] <thelonechris> Pretty much it
[1:10:16] <SGrim> Ice T here to collect his pay check. rooKek
[1:10:17] <%theo_marks> I HEAR ITS BETTER THAN CIVILIZATION 6 WITH THE BRAVE NEW WORLD EXPANSION PACK
[1:10:20] <+JoeStillLife> Ice T is great
[1:10:25] <+AntithesisEK> LUL
[1:10:29] <+Bupkis7> Oh you mean like when someone eats too much cake

[1:10:38] <mercado94> "wats incest"
[1:10:39] <+SuperCoolieoGuy> He read about CIV 5 and the Brave New World expansion on Kotaku
[1:10:39] <Arclight2879> SVU isn't as good as it used to be. It went downhill after Belzer left.
[1:10:40] <%krawtch> a new designer drug made by mixing windex, chlorine and kitty litter. Kids are calling it "toilet sparkle"
[1:10:40] <Endocrom> Isn't Ice T's wife a porn star or something?
[1:10:44] <BaronVonProlix> BIG SQUEAL
[1:10:46] <%Dingalow> Cecil sleeps in the same bed as two kids an old man. What a sicko
[1:10:49] <thelonechris> What the fuck is happening off screen?
[1:10:51] <tUxUt> Ice T blacks out during the filming of every episode so that he doesnt learn of humanitys darkness
[1:10:53] <%SuperCasualBoom> cheer200 This is for two things: Pat being 5”2 makes me a little happy cause I’m 5”3. And, singing songs I once got drunk went to a Karaoke bar with friends and sang “All by myself” but replace it that line with “Go fuck yourself”. Good times.
[1:10:54] <%theo_marks> fu\\Ice T is the best part of that show
[1:10:55] <+AmaniIsYourBoss> "Ey yo, whats with this Mista Clemps? What's a foot fetish?"
[1:10:56] <+BoboDaHobo> so you're saying it's like when someone eats too much chocolate cake?
[1:11:01] <+Skatedeandre> The gaming episode on SVU
[1:11:01] <Zansatsu0379> Ice T was born before there was sex, so of course he is surprised.
[1:11:03] <Aleate> Play Warframe LUL
[1:11:06] <Arclight2879> They are supposed
[1:11:07] <%deacon1621> He might....
[1:11:07] <Huntercd> Sex addiction isn't a thing
[1:11:07] <Admiral_PopnFresh> Patty make squeeky hiccups like my tiny 4'10" lady coworker
[1:11:10] <+Bonerlord911> @peachsaliva hi paige
[1:11:11] <treybivins> Ice T follows the SBFP
[1:11:11] <$GohanEgret> pat lacks cred
[1:11:13] <%SuichiTanaka> Pat became *that* guy
[1:11:14] <%krawtch> destiny 2 is free on ps plus and i was still like fuck that
[1:11:14] <lemonadeicecold> loud gingers distO distO
[1:11:15] <+ArcLifth> He probably would
[1:11:15] <+Skatedeandre> I don’t like destiny
[1:11:16] <AMajorTom> Get IceT on the podcast
[1:11:18] <SGrim> @Skatedeandre "they leveled up." rooKek
[1:11:18] <%theo_marks> pat you have to tweet him now
[1:11:21] <misterspotswood> what if Ice T is watching the stream right now
[1:11:21] <Zola390> @arclight2879 I believe the line is "They leveled up."
[1:11:22] <%deacon1621> And then you would be friends with Ice-T
[1:11:22] <+ValenMorrow> It's funny how Ice-T's Twitter handle is now vidya related sorta
[1:11:30] <mrjohncarlton> Pat should tell Ice T he invented Warframe and that he should play it
[1:11:32] <Baron_von_Turkeyfish> because warframe is trash
[1:11:32] <Worldbrand> im playing warframe right now and that would bother me

[1:16:30] <deviljhojho94> WHAT
[1:16:31] <+RushUnplugged> apparently they lost the original files so they can't do a direct port
[1:16:33] <alrobot2014> is the ff13 trilogy coming to switch?
[1:16:33] <%swordsman70> All of them, except that one in particular
[1:16:34] <$skyguy777> An entire comfy stream of just drawing magic for 4 hours
[1:16:37] <Prevot> it's like when they re-released Resident Evil 6, then 5, then 4 LUL
[1:16:37] <deviljhojho94> JUST LOST THEM apatLiz
[1:16:37] <averagehero1> FF8 is a Nintendo online exclusive
[1:16:37] <topendbuzz> just*
[1:16:38] <Coystick> Bahahahaha
[1:16:39] <+Punisher7771> whenes octopaige?
[1:16:41] <$jorgamund> fuck you, FF8 was great
[1:16:41] <SailingSaturn> Ouch
[1:16:42] <FourthAve> ff8 roflgatorFeels roflgatorFeels
[1:16:43] <%Remery_> Don't make FF8 a Orphan
[1:16:43] <%Sinister_Aglet> they didn't archive 10 and remade it for HD
[1:16:44] <+Ilpala271> I don't think it's that. I bet it's licensing problems with Faye Wong for Eyes On Me
[1:16:45] <jiin6> they have a PC port
[1:16:45] <MarylandJutsu> NEVER FF8
[1:16:46] <+Blain_Cooper> @PeachSaliva 8 never got ported to PS4 either.
[1:16:47] <+Grayhammatter> that's so bad LUL
[1:16:47] <+Chimeraelite> oh jesus
[1:16:47] <Laironx3> FF8 erased from history.
[1:16:47] <bluescreen1988> the japanese dont do archiving
[1:16:50] <+FrostMass22> How did Konami lose the dialogue in Silent Hill 2?
[1:16:51] <AncelDeLambert> LUL LUL LUL of COURSE that's what happened
[1:16:52] <Admiral_PopnFresh> Wha Happa?
[1:16:52] <+xxviios> FF8 has the BEST soundtrack
[1:16:53] <+CaptainJax> just remake them like they did for silent hill 2 Kappa
[1:16:54] <%swordsman70> Ha
[1:16:54] <mistermastergreg> well, they lost KH 1
[1:16:55] <TerraWraith> I thought they lost the licence to one of the songs
[1:16:58] <valriot> also its FUCKING TRAAAAAASH
[1:16:58] <%Toynota10> riparooni
[1:17:00] <+badchoice5> The best part is that, if it weren't sandwiched between 6,7,9,and 10, it would probably be considered a decent game. But too bad Squall, you just couldn't live up to the hype.
[1:17:01] <Thirtine> i thought is was because of the copyright/lisensing on some of the songs? @PeachSaliva
[1:17:01] <Dr_Donkey_Brains> couldn't they port the PC version?
[1:17:11] <%Remery_> But Triple Triad :(
[1:17:16] <+Punisher7771> pat will you play hafl life 3 when the sun implodes
[1:17:17] <AncelDeLambert> Good job, Japan, throwing everything away the second you're done sure is a good idea, right?
[1:17:17] <crimsonharvest> It was pretty common up through the 90s for devs to literallly throw code in the dumpster after a project
[1:17:18] <Huntercd> Play FF 10-2
[1:17:19] <SailingSaturn> @valriot other people want to experiece that trash cirBaka
[1:17:21] <%SuperCasualBoom> Paige, just physical attack everything and magic for cure
[1:17:23] <Rellim80> TPK TPK TPK TPK
[1:17:23] <alrobot2014> triple triad will always be better than tetra master
[1:17:25] <ccrida> They lost KH1 source i'd believe they lost FF8 as well
[1:17:25] <%umbypokochan> you should just punch the body with Yang
[1:17:29] <Zansatsu0379> I mean, FF8 does have cool moments, like when Gilgamesh just shows up...but bad.
[1:17:31] <Eresus> I'm sure they dont have the original assets for FF7 or FF9 either, and that did not stop them
[1:17:34] <%swordsman70> That gif of Squall going into the fetal position is amazing
[1:17:35] <marsano168> Squall lived up to his hype its just the other flaccidly written party memebers sucked half the fun out
[1:17:35] <$FujiSyusuke808Live> what part of portal 2 is this
[1:17:36] <jiin6> its fine Swith online will be go hahaha
[1:17:36] <+RushUnplugged> porting from another port is never the ideal
[1:17:37] <+Schir> ARCHIVING YOUR OLD GAMES IS FOR SUCKERS. GAME PRESERVATION BLOWS Kappa
[1:17:40] <+Gorgen> Hey anyone want to go kill some Al-Bhed?

[1:17:46] <leole11> lit
[1:17:47] <+tigerfang86> THE WORST TASTE
[1:17:50] <CatmanIX> just release triple triad as an independant title, problem solved
[1:17:52] <+Grayhammatter> BAD taste
[1:17:55] <AncelDeLambert> TRIAD SUCKS
[1:17:55] <+blastazoid26> It's better than blitzball
[1:17:57] <+rei0> paige has bad taste confirmed
[1:17:57] <grayjammer> TETRA IS FUCKING ASSSSSSS
[1:17:58] <Dr_Donkey_Brains> I prefer tetra master. no bullshit rules that ruin the game
[1:18:01] <Coystick> Bad taste in Boots and Card games
[1:18:04] <AncelDeLambert> Card games are garbage!
[1:18:05] <Paradocks23> Filthy Al-Bhed!

[1:18:22] <SatansDick1> the best card game is caravan from fnv
[1:18:22] <+Hinasil> Tetra Master is the biggest piece of RNG garbage
[1:18:23] <pillowwasp> Pat probably likes caravan from new vegas
[1:18:25] <ludwigvonholyblade> What's a Tetra Master?
[1:18:27] <%Remery_> Cold and Windy
[1:18:29] <+badchoice5> The best minigame is still Chocobo breeding/racing, at least if you cheat
[1:18:31] <+blastazoid26> FUCK BLITZTBALL
[1:18:32] <buffmurffy> i like the rain
[1:18:34] <Zola390> Rain. hands down.

[1:19:26] <EMP_Ike_Turner> lööps
[1:19:26] <Admiral_PopnFresh> I like the sound of blowing wind or muffled pipes
[1:19:26] <+Bupkis7> I like to listen to music as I fall asleep
[1:19:29] <%Yomandude> Pat should go to the quietest room in the world where you can hear your intestines working
[1:19:33] <+TheShal> I listen to LPs before bed. Usually from this small group called the SuperBestFriends. They're super obscure though

[1:27:30] <SGrim> To chat: honey can denature if exposed to moving air. First it will crystalize, then crack apart. It doesn't technically spoil, it just turns into a horrible tasting solid.

[1:47:09] <%TamsynRRD> He doesn't need the wheels. He stands and walks on all fours.
[1:47:11] <+Mikatonic> @AncelDeLambert Tachanka is a meme pick, but there's no completely terrible operator. The headshot instakill and other quirks of the game make everyone usable.
[1:47:17] <alrobot2014> cid looks like the thief from escaflowne
[1:47:18] <crimsonharvest> Equipment has stat buffs in this game i hope you know
[1:47:30] <+Gorgen> Recruit is best operator

[1:48:13] <+tigerfang86> NO IT ISN'T

[1:48:55] <shinigami40297> it took them like 5 years to do the cell saga
[1:49:04] <%Yomandude> The "Abridged Series" lasting that long is as stupid as a series named Final Fantasy running for thirty years
[1:49:04] <%SuperCasualBoom> Nope

[1:50:12] <Graxe_> I feel like Paige would like Super Seducer.
[1:50:15] <%umbypokochan> @PeachSaliva it was good in that it's the best worst thing i've ever seen
[1:50:16] <PakuV2> Especially MAHMOUD
[1:50:18] <%Remery_> Mahmoud is boss
[1:50:25] <rytisone> Matt reached super seducer ranking
[1:50:28] <%theo_marks> oh it was over an hour
[1:50:34] <alrobot2014> Mahmoud the sugar daddy was the best
[1:50:37] <+jkobe34> the guy calls out projared specificly
[1:50:38] <aeonicvector> @PeachSaliva ff9 has inbuilt 2-Player co-op if you want to drag Pat in
[1:50:39] <%sectorclaus> @PeachSaliva You would love Super Seducer
[1:50:39] <%SuperCasualBoom> Paige there is no special monsters on this map
[1:50:53] <deviljhojho94> CHADMOUD
[1:50:59] <AncelDeLambert> much love to BABY
[1:51:04] <aeonicvector> PS1 version though
[1:51:11] <+PipIV> a boat you say?
[1:51:12] <alrobot2014> and there's a section where cuphead gets played
[1:51:12] <%SaltyDongs> Mahouds big mac will make you humble
[1:51:17] <+NekoNinja13> it gave me an actual headache with how stupid and petty it was, but it was kinda fun
[1:51:18] <%SuperCasualBoom> That’s Fabul
[1:51:20] <alrobot2014> to make fun of the reviewer
[1:51:24] <deviljhojho94> gobbos
[1:51:27] <%JaydenSai> @PeachSaliva There's an ending where the Seducer ends up bombing a convention where Boogie and Jim Sterling are attending. He's not bitter at all
[1:51:40] <+Schir> Pat HATES syringes guys
[1:51:45] <ReekPlaysGames> the PG-13 Strip Club was also a humdinger
[1:51:47] <+skizzuto> you should probably put Cid in the front row so he can attack
[1:51:49] <deviljhojho94> Terrorism is hot
[1:51:52] <+FrostMass22> Fuck Jim Sterling tho
[1:52:06] <+Gorgen> Jim Sterling is alright.
[1:52:08] <%SuperCasualBoom> That’s Fabullshit....*slaps knee*...I’ll go now. 😬
[1:52:22] <Semiconductive> I got bronchitis and laryngitis at the same time. My freshman year was me just being sick
[1:52:27] <+shawntk_> Freshman year for me was when I had my hardest classes for all 4 years
[1:52:28] <+Louie_Salmon> @jaydensai But was it a joe
[1:52:35] <%SuperCasualBoom> Paige can’t park
[1:52:37] <+PipIV> 1st year: "wait, that's it?"
[1:52:39] <AncelDeLambert> turns out learning is easy when the course isn't arranged incompetently
[1:52:44] <+Louie_Salmon> @jaydensai joke*
[1:52:53] <+AmaniIsYourBoss> First year of college was honestly the smoothest year. Met all of friends, easy ass classes
[1:52:54] <%umbypokochan> yay dancing aminals! talk to the dancing aminals!
[1:52:55] <alrobot2014> they're so adorable
[1:52:56] <+Gorgen> Step on them.
[1:52:56] <%Dingalow> don't_
[1:52:58] <AncelDeLambert> turns out when the lesson has a GOAL it's easier to learn
[1:52:59] <+PipIV> 2nd year: "wait, there's more!?!"
[1:53:00] <graemecrackers1> Shoot couch
[1:53:01] <+AmaniIsYourBoss> all of my*

[1:53:09] <%Remery_> Pat Village <3
[1:53:10] <grayjammer> Pwease No Steppy
[1:53:18] <+PipIV> 3rd: "are we done?"
[1:53:24] <@MelBrooksKA> Unless it was eggs
[1:53:27] <Bouldus> woolies a big boi, he wouldnt be here if he could cook
[1:53:30] <demonhunter790> People make friends at college ? I’ve been here for 2 years and I’m so alone
[1:53:31] <%rdark_ksu> no it is not
[1:53:32] <skeletonknifefight> NO
[1:53:32] <Volkrotia> NO IT IS NOT
[1:53:33] <rytisone> Cooks and Crafts with Woolie and Pat
[1:53:34] <mtgtin> no
[1:53:35] <deviljhojho94> savage paige
[1:53:37] <ProRJHunter> NO
[1:53:37] <+badchoice5> Only if you use "Special Miilk"
[1:53:40] <%Remery_> cereal is not cooking
[1:53:40] <Bouldus> couldnt*
[1:53:41] <$Mendin> Crymetina probably would destroy all of you in cooking
[1:53:42] <%SuperCasualBoom> That’s surreal....
[1:53:43] <Coystick> Cereal is cooking
[1:53:46] <%SulfurousAcid> you have to heat the liquid for ramen
[1:53:46] <+coolthulhuu> ironically, matt just got roasted
[1:53:47] <%rdark_ksu> You have to boil water to make ramen paige
[1:53:48] <TerraWraith> Cereal is not cooking, and instant raman is not cooking
[1:53:49] <cgmerryo> DO YOU BOIL YOUR MILK PAIGE
[1:53:52] <Bouldus> couldnt cook*
[1:53:52] <AlastorSlain> cereal is a soup
[1:53:53] <+HostilePoundcakes> its level 1 cooking
[1:53:53] <+PipIV> 4th: "fuck, what did I learn?"
[1:53:56] <Volkrotia> If cereal is cooking, then putting water in a glass is also cooking
[1:53:57] <grayjammer> I recall hearing that Matt’s done cooking before. Plus he did Foods n’ Dudes
[1:53:57] <$Agami23> cant liam cook really well? like, stuffed bellpeppers and stuff
[1:53:58] <AncelDeLambert> @coolthulhuu LUL LUL
[1:53:58] <+Louie_Salmon> If cereal is cooking, we're all fucked
[1:53:59] <@MelBrooksKA> Liam would be the winner
[1:53:59] <+Fairy_princess77> STeak is simple
[1:54:00] <demonhunter790> Foodz and Dudez with Liam and Matt
[1:54:01] <Bouldus> damn it fucked my sentence up :P
[1:54:02] <%umbypokochan> yay dance!
[1:54:07] <+OceanGovernor> But Food n Dudez?
[1:54:08] <Coystick> Cereal is A STEW
[1:54:08] <Bakefowl> Boiled cereal
[1:54:10] <+Fairy_princess77> Then again I've been a chef for 20 years.
[1:54:12] <SGrim> Making steak is just knowing how long to cook meat?
[1:54:17] <+PipIV> mold mereal
[1:54:23] <+Gorgen> i imagine Pat is like Homer Simpson when he poors milk into cereal and it bursts into flames
[1:54:28] <DedlokPM> @alrobot2014 Think that Cuphead part was more to make fun of streamers and stream chat because in that sequence he "reads" an insult from a stream chat, when he replies with an insult of his own followed by him being swatted and then one of the swat team people starts playing the game and he plays the game good
[1:54:31] <%swordsman70> Nah
[1:54:32] <+badchoice5> But then you'd have to play FF4
[1:54:32] <cgmerryo> cooking anything is knowing how long to cook anything
[1:54:36] <%SaltyDongs> respect your elders
[1:54:38] <miguelrod777> nah
[1:54:38] <%Remery_> 9?
[1:54:41] <+Gorgen> pours*
[1:54:42] <+shadowace2400> 9
[1:54:43] <Bouldus> didnt play 9, youre a shit bag
[1:54:43] <+TheGreatBamBe> V is really good
[1:54:43] <+future_famous_person> VI
[1:54:45] <+Schir> 12 rules
[1:54:45] <BestTeaMaker> 9 is great fuck you pat
[1:54:46] <cgmerryo> doesn't necessarily mean it's gonna be good
[1:54:47] <DracaenaLeaf> Iv on the psn and Ds are great though
[1:54:48] <+badchoice5> 9 is good but hard to get into
[1:54:48] <+ssulcer> Then you'll be able to relate to strange cursory referances
[1:54:49] <eyedazzler> 4 is pog
[1:54:49] <Coystick> Breath of Fire stream when?

[1:54:57] <cherubsanonymous> It's old and bad
[1:54:57] <Johker> 9 has the best system.
[1:54:58] <%sectorclaus> 9 is actually the best fuck you Pat
[1:54:58] <CptBritches> 10 is way worse than 9
[1:54:58] <+tigerfang86> 5 IS SO GOOD
[1:54:59] <grayjammer> Kuja’s Theme
[1:55:00] <ax0lote> PAT is WRONG as always
[1:55:00] <Bouldus> Vivi is bis
[1:55:01] <AncelDeLambert> 9 has a story worth experiencing
[1:55:02] <+tigerfang86> 5 IS LIKE THE BEST
[1:55:04] <Rhinoprotoss> Story is great?

[1:55:07] <+ssulcer> The best Final Fantasy Game is Chrono Trigger
[1:55:09] <%waltzqueen> Beatrix da best
[1:55:10] <+aversal_ammar> 9 has ass combat
[1:55:10] <%Keyd00d> why don't you LIKE what I LIKE

[1:55:13] <+tigerfang86> ^^^
[1:55:14] <+badchoice5> You have to get like 2 hours in before it gets good
[1:55:15] <aeonicvector> Vivi IS the star, and Freya

[1:55:24] <Graxe_> Amarant is actually nothing.
[1:55:25] <AncelDeLambert> The monk bores me
[1:55:33] <thepardack> 10 has good combat but everything else eats ass.
[1:55:33] <grayjammer> Zidane is team dad and he rules
[1:55:34] <AncelDeLambert> Freya's great

[1:55:39] <Mexrage> we need clemps to suddenly emerge from behind the couch
[1:55:40] <%sectorclaus> 9 IS the best Pat
[1:55:42] <alrobot2014> amarant didn't spend more time than required in my party
[1:55:43] <%rdark_ksu> how about we all just agree they are are worth ignoring
[1:55:45] <+Ilpala271> amarant is boba fett, except they also didn't give him a personality, like boba fett

[1:56:08] <Huntercd> Furries

[1:56:16] <Tearonex> this is the best ever
[1:56:16] <+Superstarsage> FF9 is such a shit show story-wise. They tried but damn you can see the infinite rewrites. The only thing going for it is the characters and if you don't like that well, i cna't blame pat
[1:56:17] <+oOZtkOo> SUCH ACROBATIC SKILL PogChamp
[1:56:17] <crimsonharvest> SLAPS

[1:59:45] <%umbypokochan> yeyeyeyeeyeyeye
[1:59:52] <Thirtine> vineGreed
[1:59:54] <rytisone> souls are overrated
[1:59:57] <%MightyMaxT> Pretty much
[1:59:57] <Cthulos> Kinda
[1:59:58] <SpookyBeef7> I think he almost did.
[1:59:59] <%SuichiTanaka> Yeah, pretty much.
[2:00:00] <ProRJHunter> Yeah
[2:00:02] <Cthulos> He is dying basically
[2:00:03] <+PipIV> who was in the hell in the cell?
[2:00:04] <+TheGreatBamBe> Yes
[2:00:04] <%JaydenSai> Yeah
[2:00:04] <eyedazzler> he did
[2:00:04] <+shawntk_> Jeff Hardy fucking died but not how to think
[2:00:06] <%Toynota10> I hope this is the dungeon I'm thinking of cause its been a LONG time since I've played this
[2:00:06] <Bouldus> he should have died a long time ago
[2:00:08] <Intolerable> Almost for real
[2:00:08] <%NWR_James> Jeff is going to die in the ring
[2:00:10] <%GeneralSCPatton> I vividly remember that TPK, because I thought being over-leveled would compensate for the metal equipment.
[2:00:13] <Bouldus> its crazt
[2:00:14] <%SuichiTanaka> You could say Jeff got screwed.
[2:00:21] <Cthulos> Inserted into his ear hole
[2:00:28] <Cthulos> His piercing hole
[2:00:29] <%SuperCasualBoom> Matt Hardy freaking spine is fused to the hip
[2:00:30] <%SaltyDongs> Big drugs
[2:00:30] <+thesw1tch> a screwdriver was in his ear? damn
[2:00:33] <%sectorclaus> WAIT Jeff Hardy ISNT dead???!?!
[2:00:34] <AlasterAngelo> yeah Jeff fucking died Orton killed him
[2:00:35] <+TheoShodi> But silver is not magnetic! how it is affected by the cave?
[2:00:35] <%NWR_James> and his whole thing is "Jump off shit"
[2:00:36] <%JackMillerTime> get that dude some cbd to replace it
[2:00:38] <+TheGreatBamBe> @PeachSaliva They put a screwdriver through his ear Pat
[2:00:41] <Volkrotia> Well yea, drugs give you super armour
[2:00:41] <+PipIV> poor sting

[2:00:55] <%MightyMaxT> He's (mostly) better now
[2:00:56] <deviljhojho94> Sting :8
[2:00:57] <%Toynota10> Well the game will go over what's not and not allowed before she explores further
[2:01:01] <ProRJHunter> It Stung
[2:01:03] <Cthulos> Orton fucked Hardy's ear with a screwdriver
[2:01:14] <%umbypokochan> go to Edge's castle and get killed by chest monsters
[2:01:15] <+PipIV> Brother NERO
[2:01:17] <%Remery_> I miss Lita :(
[2:01:20] <%NWR_James> But also Matt is way crazier
[2:01:23] <pillowwasp> Enterprise can move fast
[2:01:30] <+MaiHusbando9S> but it comes with a free froghurt!
[2:01:33] <%Toynota10> Its very exciting when you first get an airship and can go wherever you want in the world
[2:01:35] <Spydurman> that's bad
[2:01:36] <Cthulos> His piercing hole
[2:01:36] <RCtiger0> Hey kids drugs and knives are awesome
[2:01:42] <%MightyMaxT> Well, ear hole where his gauges were
[2:01:42] <%Dingalow> Orton Heard a Who
[2:01:43] <Cthulos> He likes fingering Jeff's ear hole
[2:01:50] <+shawntk_> @PeachSaliva No, Orton put the screwdriver through the hole in his ear from his gauge and twisted it like 2 or 3 times
[2:01:50] <%SuperCasualBoom> Orrin kills people watching his headlocks
[2:01:52] <%SaltyDongs> Ka Ra Te

[2:09:21] <%Keyd00d> *worse
[2:09:23] <+PipIV> read it
[2:09:23] <Jpthunder01> The game is great
[2:09:24] <Zereaux> mary elizabeth winstead is hot as hell
[2:09:28] <buffmurffy> comic is worse than the movie. Comic's way more hipstery
[2:09:29] <%Toynota10> and its better
[2:09:32] <Admiral_PopnFresh> alll good parodies come from a place of love
[2:09:42] <+SickWheelchairCombos> ff4 is among the top 3 ff games
[2:09:45] <Volkrotia> It is VERY Canadian
[2:09:56] <+SickWheelchairCombos> along with 6 and whichever one you like
[2:09:57] <+badchoice5> So he's basically Canadian Harry Potter?
[2:09:58] <RCtiger0> I have the game on my PS3 before they toke it down
[2:09:58] <+Jpdodds> The reason Nega-Scott is a nice guy is because regular Scott is a SHIT
[2:10:07] <Huntercd> Scott Pilgrim is an asshole
[2:10:07] <%Remery_> Very Maple Leaf
[2:10:08] <%umbypokochan> it's not as bad as Nick and Nora's Infinite Playlist
[2:10:12] <%Dingalow> I loved Scott Pilgrim the movie, but not interested in the comics at all
[2:10:17] <%SuperCasualBoom> “I was bicurious” “And I’m bi-furious!” That’s cringe
[2:10:18] <AlasterAngelo> was Woolie the super vegan
[2:10:22] <crimsonharvest> Have you ever fire a bow paige? You pull the string with your strong hand.
[2:10:24] <+Fairy_princess77> Remove shield
[2:10:27] <sponsoredviewer910> LUL
[2:10:29] <Rhinoprotoss> Scott Pilgrim doesn't make a single decision in the movie
[2:10:29] <%Toynota10> and he dated a high schooler named Knives?
[2:10:35] <%rdark_ksu> a bow takes 2 hands ya dip
[2:10:36] <$lutefiiisk> This is Portal 2 levels of Paige
[2:10:38] <%Keyd00d> that line is hilarious
[2:10:38] <Graxe_> Bows require both hands, Paige.
[2:10:39] <+SickWheelchairCombos> poison
[2:10:45] <Dr_Donkey_Brains> You can equip anything in either hand it doesn't matter
[2:10:48] <sponsoredviewer910> paladin with the honorable poison arrows
[2:10:50] <%Dingalow> @SuperCasualBoom Is that a real line from the comics? I don't remember that from the film
[2:10:53] <Bouldus> althought wit hthe bow in the right hand, he is left handing the bow
[2:10:55] <+Grayhammatter> yeah sure, just shoot your legend
[2:10:57] <%GarbageNirvana> The idea is that Scott is a shit and through the story he comes to realize how much of a shit he was and is
[2:10:59] <+SickWheelchairCombos> holy poison cowardice
[2:10:59] <%Toynota10> nice water
[2:11:05] <%umbypokochan> gotta change party order cuz yang in the back

[2:11:13] <Volkrotia> Pls make some cool RE shit
[2:11:14] <Paralurx> The comics are way better, but yea Scott is sort of a scumbag for most of the story. The exchange that summed it up perfectly is "Scott, I think you're the nicest guy I've ever dated." "Wow, that's kinda sad."
[2:11:16] <+SickWheelchairCombos> yang's gotta be up front
[2:11:16] <+TheoShodi> yes it is honarabl and noble kill monsters with poisoned arrows

[2:37:06] <%CastellanVon> NO DON'T GO DOWN THE HOLE
[2:37:06] <+skizzuto> it's literally the letter X

[2:37:11] <+Yeajow> It marks the spot
[2:37:12] <Zaphire_Saucypants> KH stream when?
[2:37:13] <PakuV2> It's a magic X-shaped GPS Tracker
[2:37:15] <RoughDraftVS> My favorite part of the stream, just pat trying to be.
[2:37:16] <arcaderabbit48> @badchoice5 Yeah, and the one for KH3 is about being determined to keep a relationship going despite her partner's misgivings, while the Japanese theme is basically a marriage proposal,
[2:37:18] <%umbypokochan> no don't i hate it
[2:37:18] <+SimplestJack> What's the longest time you've escaped FF14?
[2:37:20] <$thewhiterice92> Did you beat Octopath?
[2:37:20] <CatmanIX> X, some say kai

[2:37:23] <%BioHunter> i care
[2:37:27] <BeardedLuchador> Kappa people don't care but they're the top of the FF14 channel
[2:37:28] <nobleman1992> You two should stream KH
[2:37:29] <Xelhesia> I FUCKIN CARE
[2:37:29] <+SickWheelchairCombos> it's a matter of content vs grinding pat
[2:37:29] <VritraReiRei> I like them FeelsBadMan
[2:37:30] <Bouldus> ill watch them
[2:37:30] <DefaultSettiings> what is this creature
[2:37:31] <Jaller101514> yakuza 6 fits better to how you stream. its a very similar structure to spider man
[2:37:32] <%Sadira_snack_attack> I love your XIV streams
[2:37:34] <deviljhojho94> BUT SPIDERMAN THO
[2:37:35] <Worldbrand> Just play two games at once
[2:37:35] <%Remery_> i care i love looking at Lalfells
[2:37:35] <+Gorgen> play CK2 Pat Kappa
[2:37:36] <$BuoyantSoul> I burnt myself out on FFXIV accidentally

[2:37:39] <SGrim> Bullshit. I watch whatever you do.
[2:37:39] <$NocturneNovember> cheer200 I should add to that last message, I meant to say yesterday
[2:37:42] <+SickWheelchairCombos> content gets watched grinding doesn't
[2:37:42] <arcaderabbit48> Well, maybe if you didn't spend two hours getting Settings JUST RIGHT
[2:37:43] <Nexoosen> Pat there was a game speedrunning marathon and during a break they had majima doing the creepy sex dance, just thought you'd appreciate that knowledge
[2:37:45] <$Agami23> its hard to stream ff14 with competition like goldentot and max
[2:37:47] <+PipIV> what about Rainbow?
[2:37:49] <+Superstarsage> aren't most of your streams attempted during nightmare login times?
[2:37:50] <Farples> would you do it for a scooby snack?
[2:37:52] <bulletclubbenny> Patt show us your feet
[2:37:53] <+BaronEgo> 4.4 looks fun though

[2:38:22] <%SulfurousAcid> lalafel
[2:38:22] <+LogothX> With Battle for Azeroth shitting the bed hard I predict FF14 will get a surge
[2:38:22] <%Remery_> take those socks off
[2:38:26] <+SickWheelchairCombos> yakuza 5 though
[2:38:26] <+SimplestJack> you could do an FF update stream and gauge the audience?
[2:38:27] <Rhinoprotoss> SHIFT CECIL UP
[2:38:28] <CptBritches> Kingdom Hearts 3 playthrough on the channel better happen
[2:38:33] <%Hilleltaco> I remember watching Vinny's E3 stream, and hearing him describe his outsider perspective of the KH trailers as "first there's a dark edgelord but then Mickey's like "HOHO"'
[2:38:33] <+SickWheelchairCombos> that's important
[2:38:43] <lovelycoconut> Are you planning to play anything super spooky wooky for Halloween?
[2:38:46] <%Djinnazz> Now drop them sweat pants!
[2:38:47] <%rabiddragon2299> I tried so hard to get in to ff14 but just couldn't

[2:58:37] <+SickWheelchairCombos> you don't listen
[2:58:38] <Graxe_> @PeachSaliva You will know if claws will not work. The ATB will go really slow.

[2:59:09] <+ThatGuyfromMars> uh no
[2:59:10] <+SickWheelchairCombos> drinking eggs sucks
[2:59:10] <%rdark_ksu> its a texture not a taste thing
[2:59:10] <bulletclubbenny> Pat's feet are fine
[2:59:12] <Volkrotia> Its JUST for protein
[2:59:12] <ECRead> it feels weird
[2:59:14] <SatansDick1> its not great
[2:59:18] <%deacon1621> Not great, that's how they taste
[2:59:19] <%Remery_> Semen joke?
[2:59:19] <%Sadira_snack_attack> also the ecoli
[2:59:22] <JeedyJay> Hi Paige. I started playing along on the GBC "hard mode" version.
[2:59:22] <miguelrod777> tastes like salmonella
[2:59:24] <%SuperCasualBoom> You can get a stroke quick
[2:59:25] <Your_Friendly_Futa> Its great for you, if you can eat it
[2:59:26] <%Toynota10> Looks like some donations were skipped if they're already talking about eggs...
[2:59:27] <+badchoice5> That sounds like Paige's brand of awful
[2:59:29] <%Toast_Master_General> taste like snot
[2:59:33] <+FatBobNoHarley> cheer100 cheer100 we all know that it's not gonna matter how that bacon comes out because it's gonna drown in mustard anyway
[2:59:37] <+LogothX> you can only have raw eggs in japan
[2:59:39] <SatansDick1> the yolk is fine, its the white thats gross
[2:59:46] <%deacon1621> That's true
[2:59:47] <$BuoyantSoul> it does something for them
[2:59:50] <%Toast_Master_General> Ma dude
[2:59:50] <JeedyJay> We doing the Dark Elf quest?
[2:59:51] <+pkmamsters> gives them something to grab
[2:59:52] <+thesw1tch> @peachsaliva have you ever had a hard boiled egg? drinking eggs tastes exactly like that except raw and could have have salmonella
[2:59:52] <%SuperCasualBoom> Tellah magic will be a big help with fire spells except ogres
[2:59:52] <+Everpresent_Overseer> Baldingful?
[2:59:53] <rytisone> beautifull, just like Jason Statham
[2:59:56] <miguelrod777> get them hot
[2:59:56] <%rdark_ksu> Paige you are an anomaly
[2:59:57] <SuperFineButtHairs> like an angry little tomato
[2:59:57] <GarrisonArmory> And looks, and charm, and personality
[2:59:59] <gloriusUMU> Paige, how would Pat know?
[2:59:59] <+SickWheelchairCombos> nothing that the bacon dick doesn't make up for
[3:00:00] <%Remery_> something to pull on in the bedroom\
[3:00:10] <SuperFineButtHairs> some chicks may be into that
[3:00:12] <CptBritches> Paige likes that part
[3:00:13] <JeedyJay> Hope you brought non-metallic gear!
[3:00:17] <+TheImmortal70> Mah, gic

[3:00:34] <Fist_reborn> they dont like it when the dick is as big as the man itself
[3:00:37] <EMP_Ike_Turner> SMOrc
[3:00:37] <CrimsonGargoyle> @PeachSaliva pat if it reminds them of their dad, that means bald short dudes got hella laid LUL
[3:00:38] <Kenori> Can someone hellp me get their attention about my donations?
[3:00:39] <JeedyJay> Cool.
[3:00:39] <Kenori> Please?
[3:00:40] <+Nomicro4u> Pat waved at a blind kid
[3:00:46] <SatansDick1> hey look its some ONIONS
[3:00:48] <SuperFineButtHairs> "burn my steak daddy"
[3:00:49] <Graxe_> What does Peep do again?
[3:00:51] <CptBritches> Pat is making fun of blind children
[3:00:56] <%JaydenSai> @PeachSaliva You should swap Cecil for Cid, becuase he has a bow, and Cid is a melee attacker anyway
[3:01:01] <Your_Friendly_Futa> Put Mayo and Tomato sauce on your bacon
[3:01:02] <%Remery_> oh god
[3:01:02] <CatmanIX> @Kenori they'll get to your donations eventually
[3:01:03] <Your_Friendly_Futa> Its the best
[3:01:04] <%SuperCasualBoom> Yang should just attack. No kicks
[3:01:06] <$BuoyantSoul> Paige likes her meats salty and long and flat, got it
[3:01:08] <skeletonknifefight> "i like it nice and salty"
[3:01:09] <+pkmamsters> Bacon with a mustard glaze
[3:01:10] <Snaketsu> YEA JUST SALT THE BACON
[3:01:12] <Kenori> @CatmanIX It hasnt gone through
[3:01:12] <gloriusUMU> Mustard bacon is the worst thing I've ever heard
[3:01:20] <+thesw1tch> paige loves salty things. makes sense she dates pat
[3:01:22] <Kenori> @CatmanIX or it would have been read already
[3:01:23] <+badchoice5> Add a little salty something to the bacon
[3:01:23] <Your_Friendly_Futa> Mustard is the actual worst
[3:01:24] <JeedyJay> It's a good thing Cecil is pretty tough, naturally.
[3:01:27] <%SuperCasualBoom> Put Cid in fromt
[3:01:27] <%SaltyDongs> He do cook
[3:01:33] <Rhinoprotoss> Mustard is the worst thing I've ever heard
[3:01:36] <rytisone> Cooking gone wrong/sexual
[3:01:38] <%Toast_Master_General> IRL future steam?
[3:01:42] <CatmanIX> @Kenori ah, well, tweet at her i guess
[3:01:43] <Volkrotia> Cooking is just chemistry, tho. Totally quantifiable
[3:01:43] <+badchoice5> "Now, HEAT the water"
[3:01:44] <+thesw1tch> pat sounds salty as he speaks
[3:01:46] <SuperFineButtHairs> it bubbles pat
[3:01:46] <JeedyJay> And, yeah, put Cid in front. He's a bruiser.
[3:01:48] <SuperFineButtHairs> jesus
[3:01:49] <%SuperCasualBoom> Cid in front row is powerful.
[3:01:51] <+caffeine_beast> finally caught you live
[3:01:57] <+Rafferty3231> Pat, Pat, Pat...
[3:01:59] <ECRead> dear lord Pat
[3:02:02] <GoYaK> Bake a cake
[3:02:02] <+timblenaut> my mom divorced my dad because he was exactly like you trying to cook pat
[3:02:04] <%rdark_ksu> baking is being a giant anal weirdo
[3:02:06] <%JaydenSai> @PeachSaliva You should swap Cecil for Cid, becuase he has a bow, and Cid is a melee attacker anyway and should be in the Front regardless
[3:02:08] <ECRead> IT'S ALL SCIENCE
[3:02:09] <+cereal_box_conspiracy> molecular gastronomy is science
[3:02:10] <%SuperCasualBoom> Swoon!!!!!
[3:02:12] <SuperFineButtHairs> pat is a small red baby
[3:02:13] <+badchoice5> The best foods in life are baked
[3:02:16] <Thirtine> @PeachSaliva im literally a (pastry) chef, i can advise/answer questions LUL
[3:02:18] <$BuoyantSoul> If it's not specific, then put it on half hot.
[3:02:19] <GoYaK> Bake a Cake you Cake Lord
[3:02:19] <%bevyrage> both are an art and science
[3:02:21] <Laironx3> Just get a fire extinguisher just in case.
[3:02:22] <%Toast_Master_General> Cooking is just chemicals
[3:02:22] <%Remery_> It's all science besides microwaving
[3:02:30] <CrimsonGargoyle> @PeachSaliva you don't need to learn to cook pat, you need to learn to wing it LUL
[3:02:30] <Kenori> done
[3:02:31] <EMP_Ike_Turner> this is literally me and my wife, she hates to bake because its so specific
[3:02:34] <Mrbaconator> @PeachSaliva PAT I am VERY much like you. not to the point of how many bubbles in boiling water but i am very much a time guy. I am better at baking than cooking
[3:02:35] <+badchoice5> Pat should bake some muffin-cakes
[3:02:35] <srkAres> how the fuck is pat still alive. then again paige is too.
[3:02:36] <rathma301> you watched a video tutorial on how to boil water?
[3:02:50] <Graxe_> Cooking is actually just chemistry with food.
[3:02:50] <SuperFineButtHairs> they eat the souls of the non-ginger
[3:02:53] <rytisone> Pat is a baby and Paige is into them
[3:02:54] <%SuperCasualBoom> Yep
[3:02:54] <ECRead> i mean that's true
[3:02:56] <$BuoyantSoul> It's All Ogre
[3:02:57] <+Gorgen> How do you know if you burned your water?
[3:02:57] <%Djinnazz> she gonna die
[3:02:58] <%SulfurousAcid> Run
[3:03:03] <%rdark_ksu> Pat needs a crockpot. throw in the shit and turn it to 10 hrs then go play warframe
[3:03:04] <SuperFineButtHairs> thats why pat doesnt need to cook
[3:03:06] <MiareNoKo> frankenshrek
[3:03:06] <ECRead> gross
[3:03:07] <%SuperCasualBoom> You can run away Paige
[3:03:08] <%SulfurousAcid> you can run right?
[3:03:09] <SatansDick1> they haves layers like ONIONS
[3:03:10] <Kenori> I sent a tweet
[3:03:11] <+badchoice5> IT'S ALL OGRE NOW
[3:03:12] <%Saggitori> 赤ちゃん
[3:03:12] <+thedannydarko> How does he live such a lunatic life
[3:03:13] <EnlightenedKramer> if pat is a small baby, does that mean paige robbed the cradle?
[3:03:16] <ECRead> degenerates
[3:03:19] <%SchroedingersFerret> I consider water "boiling" when the bubbles form at the bottom and reach the surface without dissipating.
[3:03:20] <%Remery_> I once microwave a frozen burger patty, taste like nothingness
[3:03:20] <Kenori> But shes not checking twitter :(
[3:03:30] <SatansDick1> which one is shrek
[3:03:36] <themagic_conch> gross keep that in the bedroom
[3:03:41] <SuperFineButtHairs> incest is wrong
[3:03:41] <CurrySauseBandit> Why is she not just focus firing one Ogre at a time?
[3:03:47] <%Remery_> Banned in Japan
[3:03:53] <+FrostMass22> @enlightenedkramer With all of Paige's health problems, it's more accurate to say he's robbing the grave
[3:04:01] <%SulfurousAcid> run
[3:04:01] <+thesw1tch> @enlightenedkramer In no way could pat afford a cradle. paige robbed the dumpster
[3:04:02] <JeedyJay> It occurs to me that Galuf is just Muscle-Tellah.
[3:04:06] <CatmanIX> @Kenori she'll see it eventually, probably
[3:04:10] <Rhinoprotoss> How is that being attacked from behind?
[3:04:12] <%SuperCasualBoom> @remery_ You mean accepted
[3:04:17] <+Gorgen> does Elmo still have moldy cat penis?
[3:04:17] <+thesw1tch> Kappa

[3:04:27] <%leirazamzam> cheer200 Hi Paige (and Pat)! I've become a recent fan of you and your streams and am happy to finally tune in live and subscribe for the first time. It's also a total bonus that you're a fellow fan of the Final Fantasies, keep up these comfy/not-so-comfy FFIV sessions
[3:04:30] <Kenori> ugh

[3:04:47] <%Remery_> @SuperCasualBoom Hand Holding? I don't think Japan can hand that amount of sexual tension
[3:04:49] <GoYaK> Toilet-senpai
[3:04:52] <CptBritches> Is that why he loves Pat so much?
[3:04:55] <JeedyJay> You guys make me really glad I'm not a cat person.
[3:04:56] <Rhinoprotoss> They aren't behind if you're already facing them when battle starts
[3:05:01] <+heckyell> Toilet go up.
[3:05:08] <%BioHunter> hey pat any tips for tyranny?
[3:05:08] <%SuperCasualBoom> @remery_ In their anime, it’s all legal
[3:05:09] <Laironx3> He would be happy but I won't let him.
[3:05:13] <rytisone> Elmo likes toilet and Pat
[3:05:23] <+Grayhammatter> and paige
[3:05:23] <%leirazamzam> :D
[3:05:26] <%SulfurousAcid> because they are similar
[3:05:31] <StarlightGalactic> pat is inherently anti comfy
[3:05:34] <Your_Friendly_Futa> I am thoroughly comfy
[3:05:35] <JeedyJay> Tellah will slap your shit.
[3:05:36] <%Remery_> @SuperCasualBoom Anime is how they express themselves
[3:05:39] <CptBritches> Pat, toilet, what's the difference really
[3:05:42] <%rdark_ksu> cheer204 Maybe Pat needs a crockpot? Just toss in the shit, turn to 10 hours and go play warframe
[3:05:43] <+badchoice5> Confirmed, Pat was comfy after he came
[3:05:43] <+heckyell> Paige go down. Toilet go up. Pat go up.
[3:05:46] <+SickWheelchairCombos> pat is comfy, paige is not comfy
[3:05:51] <+SickWheelchairCombos> paige is aggro
[3:06:05] <Graxe_> So is the next Portal 2 stream gonna be in the afternoon instead of at night?
[3:06:06] <%SuperCasualBoom> Paige you can run away if needed
[3:06:20] <SatansDick1> is that a bloodborne
[3:06:24] <srkAres> paige is gonna be aggro when she forgets about the bacon
[3:06:32] <CatmanIX> lol, these guys are reskins from FF1
[3:06:33] <SuperFineButtHairs> dont forget the bacon
[3:06:40] <SatansDick1> its the bois who steal your insight

[3:07:21] <SuperFineButtHairs> thatsa big ass cat, or maybe pat is small in comparison
[3:07:31] <gloriusUMU> I pictured Paige as a bad tank. She's always drawing aggro from the universe and the healers can barely keep up.
[3:07:32] <+skizzuto> we have been blessed with his presence
[3:07:35] <%Remery_> Finally the star of the show

[3:08:37] <%SulfurousAcid> sipsipHellmo sipsipHellmo sipsipHellmo sipsipHellmo
[3:08:39] <%Remery_> Elmo is the main character and Pat and Paige are fanservice
[3:08:56] <SuperFineButtHairs> pat could ride him into battle
[3:09:00] <%SuperCasualBoom> Run away Paige!!! Run away!!!
[3:09:02] <JeedyJay> @gloriusUMU I ask, because one of the characters has a taunt, and she's a glass cannon.

[3:09:23] <%GarbageNirvana> Y'all aren't gonna The Omen off your balcony for Elmo are you
[3:09:31] <MrDrayko> cheer200 hey paige! i realised i've only given bits to the little red man despite watching both of you regularly and equally! i usually provide pat with some silly comic factoid along with the bits like the spider-man villain: the thousand, so i ask you peach, what area of comics would you like to hear a factoid from?
[3:09:33] <Kenori> okay its not going through
[3:09:33] <JeedyJay> @gloriusUMU Also, that character is a redheaded cat-person.
[3:09:33] <Prism_Wing> wtf is the purpose of a creature being black and white? lol
[3:09:36] <Volkrotia> some of the new Melee stuf in WF looks DOPE
[3:09:39] <%SulfurousAcid> run so you don't waste resources and die
[3:09:40] <+LogothX> my time on this earth is ogre...
[3:09:50] <%JaydenSai> @PeachSaliva I heard that big purr, he's so strong
[3:09:56] <$BuoyantSoul> he beep because he is very good
[3:09:58] <SuperFineButtHairs> mine did that too, theyre like birds
[3:10:01] <%SuperCasualBoom> If you want to conserve you can run away till you get a save point
[3:10:06] <gloriusUMU> @JeedyJay This information makes me happy and I can't not go do that now, thank you
[3:10:19] <CptBritches> Elmo is black and white because he believes in racial harmony
[3:10:23] <+Gorgen> i was freaking out cause i didnt know where my cat was but the asshole is on my lap
[3:10:26] <CptBritches> What a hero
[3:10:41] <+tigerfang86> elmo has prevented the race war
[3:10:48] <+tigerfang86> by taking both races into himself
[3:10:57] <SuperFineButtHairs> like michael jackson
[3:10:57] <+badchoice5> Paige conquers soldiers and elemental demons and all manner of monsters, then gets wrecked by stupid ogres in a cave because metal is heavy
[3:10:59] <Volkrotia> Hey, people w/ ear piercings. How do I wear headphones w/o feeling like my brain is being stabbed?
[3:11:02] <+FrostMass22> Talk about the clone saga

[3:23:04] <gloriusUMU> Ferengi huh? It's weird how you two wear socks just so that we can take them off with our eyes
[3:23:04] <EMP_Ike_Turner> because you don't have a heart for profit
[3:23:07] <Travian_Valoris> the fat is the expression of your love
[3:23:09] <+FrostMass22> Comparing anyone to the Ferengi may be the worst imaginable insult.

[3:30:59] <+Reevesypoo> ITS ABOUT STRONG BIG SEXY
[3:31:00] <%theo_marks> despacito is about fuckign a girl slowly
[3:31:00] <Volkrotia> Its just an overplayed song that became a meme
[3:31:01] <seniorwhiteface> Despacito is the saddest song
[3:31:01] <gloriusUMU> Ducimo
[3:31:02] <%bluetocho13> Its about Sex
[3:31:05] <%Remery_> its a fucky song
[3:31:05] <%SuperCasualBoom> No. The song suck
[3:31:05] <+king_wragles> despacito means that you are doing something slowly

[3:31:12] <%cervidaequus> Despacito = doucement
[3:31:13] <grayjammer> Doucement
[3:31:14] <$Fenlig> How goes the sundownining?
[3:31:15] <SatansDick1> its a bad song, thats the entire joke
[3:31:25] <%krawtch> i had a friend in elementary who pronounced Paladin like Aladdin so i stopped being friends with him
[3:31:26] <Ominnous> doucement
[3:31:29] <SuperFineButtHairs> despacito 2: electric boogaloo
[3:31:31] <Farples> Fun ff14 fact, the game will not allow you to play copyrighted songs till you hit at least lvl 50
[3:31:41] <+Reevesypoo> I prefer Despacito Second Gig more Kappa
[3:31:42] <Prevot> Despacito starts at Symphony of the Night
[3:31:46] <%JaydenSai> Cid in front @PeachSaliva
[3:31:49] <+badchoice5> Despacito 2: The Despaciting
[3:31:51] <SuperFineButtHairs> IM FUCKING INVINCIBLE
[3:31:51] <+MisterCrimson> the three smashy bois up front
[3:31:53] <%SuperCasualBoom> Cid our front

[3:31:57] <Farples> 100% truuth, no lies at all
[3:32:00] <%SulfurousAcid> put Cid in froooont
[3:32:02] <Laironx3> There's a local bar in my town in Mexico advertising: "100% Despacito-Free"
[3:32:06] <%Remery_> That's awful
[3:32:06] <%krawtch> fuck you Craig its PAL A DIN
[3:32:09] <Yum438> How do you guys feel about the non permanent party members in this game? I personally love that characters join and leave your party for various reasons
[3:32:22] <GoYaK> How's the sundowning...AT MIDNIGHT ?
[3:32:24] <+FrostMass22> Sundowning? That means Paige would be invincible for a whole month up in the arctic circle
[3:32:25] <CptBritches> It's PAY-LAY-DINE
[3:32:26] <+badchoice5> I knew people who said Paladin that way. I don't talk to them anymore
[3:32:30] <%SulfurousAcid> form on him twice in the same place
[3:32:36] <SuperFineButtHairs> kids are cruel, jack

[3:33:14] <CapOfAllFools> Man, this "3 characters in one row, 2 characters in the other" mechanic really has a steep learning curve.
[3:33:20] <+Superstarsage> tellah is so invulnerable
[3:33:33] <SuperFineButtHairs> paige is dead
[3:33:34] <+badchoice5> This battle is SLAP

[3:34:14] <arcaderabbit48> The True FF4 Starts Here!
[3:34:16] <TheMilhouseExperience> It's a dick monster
[3:34:22] <SuperFineButtHairs> its dick worm
[3:34:24] <%MightyMaxT> I thought it was pronounced SEH-KILL Kappa
[3:34:24] <%krawtch> D Breath hehehehehe
[3:34:29] <%SuperCasualBoom> It sucking its own dick

[3:34:35] <+badchoice5> NEVER TURN INTO A GIANT SNAKE IT NEVER EVER WORKS
[3:34:36] <SuperFineButtHairs> like the ones that live in the amazon
[3:34:43] <+Reevesypoo> Dick breath WutFace
[3:34:49] <+MisterCrimson> use Virus, it casts faster and isn't resisted

[3:35:04] <+SickWheelchairCombos> dark elf a bicth
[3:35:04] <arcaderabbit48> @badchoice5 It worked for Orochimaru, in a very roundabout long-term kinda way
[3:35:14] <+smargh1015> man i remember the ds version was way harder then this but i was a child
[3:35:20] <TerraWraith> Edward did his 1 and only useful
[3:35:26] <$Agami23> e learned where pat needs to go
[3:35:27] <SuperFineButtHairs> this music is so good
[3:35:32] <+king_wragles> late night bacon?
[3:35:35] <%MightyMaxT> Crunchy Bacon or Chewy Bacon?
[3:35:44] <+FrostMass22> We're getting porked up in here
[3:35:45] <%SulfurousAcid> late night, or early morning?
[3:35:45] <+king_wragles> Crunchy bacon, or a mistake?
[3:35:46] <+Superstarsage> @smargh1015 You remember correctly, ff2 us is basically super nerfed mode. The jp version was inherently harder etc. etc.
[3:35:50] <marsano168> The ds version actually does have increased difficulty
[3:35:56] <seniorwhiteface> Best bacon is Tofu Bacon
[3:35:59] <%SuperCasualBoom> Chewy Granola Bacon...?
[3:36:03] <KilroyGrin532> I DO
[3:36:03] <+Superstarsage> There's a ton of us rom hacks to either A) restore jp balance or B) hard mode it up
[3:36:07] <Zaphire_Saucypants> OH MY GOD I LOVE WATCHING THIS FUCK DICK AROUND ON TWITTER!
[3:36:08] <%SulfurousAcid> increased, or jp?
[3:36:11] <Eresus> yes
[3:36:12] <%MrDrayko> check your twitters , i sent you a pic of the canadian supers
[3:36:12] <+Reevesypoo> Twitter Stream PogChamp
[3:36:15] <rytisone> Bacon making with prelude in background
[3:36:16] <+badchoice5> I want to wtach that
[3:36:19] <SuperFineButtHairs> hey i want to watch pat DICK
[3:36:21] <%SvenHolgersson> It is like the easiest
[3:36:23] <SuperFineButtHairs> around
[3:36:27] <lilbreezy1155> I thought the DS version was pretty difficult
[3:36:29] <+smargh1015> didnt the guy who wrote requim do it minutes before he had to present it?
[3:36:34] <%SulfurousAcid> these boss fights are going by LIT fast
[3:36:34] <AncelDeLambert> Incorrect madam
[3:36:37] <+badchoice5> It is certainly for adults like Paige, I agree
[3:36:42] <Farples> Are you kidding me, we want to watch him to play ff14 and the majority of that between patches is him staring at the market board for hours
[3:36:43] <%SvenHolgersson> Real easy apatDab apatDab apatDab apatDab apatDab
[3:36:43] <Aleate> But not FF8 Kappa
[3:36:45] <%krawtch> which is weird because for games like Devil May Cry the US normal mode is JPN hard
[3:36:47] <%SuperCasualBoom> FFIV is for the Paiges
[3:36:50] <%MightyMaxT> I love 10 for it's battle system
[3:36:50] <Zola390> You know what would be hysterical? Paige playing Hitman: Blood Money.
[3:36:52] <TheBlankAce> There is literally a version of FF4 called FF4 Easy Type
[3:36:54] <+SickWheelchairCombos> I'm going to bed you dicks
[3:36:54] <JeedyJay> I mean - they did, but your characters also have fewer abilities.
[3:36:54] <lilbreezy1155> @smargh1015 yes I believe Uematsu hates prelude
[3:37:04] <+SickWheelchairCombos> you and your bacon
[3:37:06] <%JaydenSai> @PeachSaliva Can you imagine leaving the dungeon WITHOUT grabbing the Crystal?
[3:37:06] <%deacon1621> @seniorwhiteface Is it good? I would think the texture would be off.
[3:37:12] <%NWR_James> unequip Pat
[3:37:14] <Zaphire_Saucypants> Is it Pat and his phone of Twitters?
[3:37:18] <+badchoice5> Everyone is about to die
[3:37:19] <+king_wragles> welp, better just unequip everyone
[3:37:21] <%SuperCasualBoom> Nope
[3:37:23] <Prevot> fucking shitty old games where people leave and take your items NotLikeThis
[3:37:24] <Shinmaddrox> They removed several spells and worst of all they removed darkness from cecil

[3:38:13] <Aleate> Cecil, the Pa-Lay-Din
[3:38:14] <%deacon1621> Reward Bacons
[3:38:18] <seniorwhiteface> @deacon1621 Then probably not.
[3:38:21] <%SulfurousAcid> NO KICK
[3:38:21] <SuperFineButtHairs> that always bothered me
[3:38:26] <%rdark_ksu> bacon is not governed by time. Every time is acceptable bacon eating time
[3:38:27] <Shinmaddrox> Use exit
[3:38:27] <%Remery_> she deserves salty meat
[3:38:27] <+badchoice5> You DO deserve backon Paige
[3:38:31] <Aleate> LUL
[3:38:34] <%krawtch> i only know how to make an entire pack of bacon and only when it is not breakfast time
[3:38:35] <Farples> Holy fuck, that's the tam tara boss

[3:39:03] <%SuperCasualBoom> 🤣
[3:39:13] <Travian_Valoris> escape rope
[3:39:19] <rytisone> 2 am bacon is the best way to say "I dont care"
[3:39:20] <$BuoyantSoul> SourPls
[3:39:21] <%krawtch> does Cecil make the WEEOOO WEEEOO noise himself or
[3:39:34] <%SulfurousAcid> of course he does
[3:39:35] <Shinmaddrox> Exit in battle is just a better way to run
[3:39:38] <BestTeaMaker> Boko best Chocobo
[3:39:43] <%deacon1621> @seniorwhiteface Fair enough, I'll stick to the classic.

[3:39:59] <+badchoice5> For how much utility this game is missing, it's STUNNING that they included that switch your main character feature
[3:40:15] <%deacon1621> Paige you have said you big about eighteen times in the last hour.
[3:40:16] <seniorwhiteface> Elmo big strong boi
[3:40:17] <BestTeaMaker> not so much missing as it is not added yet
[3:40:26] <Your_Friendly_Futa> How long does this fucking bacon take?
[3:40:30] <CatmanIX> stingrat? isn't that just a porcupine?
[3:40:30] <seniorwhiteface> Elmo the main character
[3:40:32] <SuperFineButtHairs> yall canucks making me want bacon a 1 am
[3:40:39] <hntronium> Don't burn the bacon
[3:40:55] <%rdark_ksu> @PeachSaliva Paige if you have hard boiled eggs you can make a marinade and make them into shoyu eggs they are delicious. I have 15 in my fridge right now.
[3:40:56] <+badchoice5> Paige, you can't just stick thicc meat into your mouth live on Twitch
[3:41:00] <Eresus> @badchoice5 it also has 2 player coop, but unlike ff5 or ff6 it does not show it in the options
[3:41:01] <%krawtch> it eats other flowers
[3:41:04] <%SuperCasualBoom> The flower the cannibal
[3:41:07] <%krawtch> its vegan and also a cannibal
[3:41:18] <%Remery_> @badchoice5 don't stop her

[3:58:22] <$deadpalvgz> It's just third party kissing.
[3:58:22] <%MightyMaxT> Genuine Question: Is "yeet" a reference to the "yee" dinosaur meme?
[3:58:23] <+Reevesypoo> Pat is a fucking unit, alpha chad has no boundries

[3:58:35] <+greenhathero> apatWrong apatWrong apatWrong
[3:58:35] <%krawtch> he puts your thick ginger weiner in his mouth Paige, whats the big deal about a toothbrush
[3:58:37] <StarlightGalactic> absolutely disgusting
[3:58:37] <$deadpalvgz> He's right tho.
[3:58:37] <KitsuneSidhe> You were incest?!
[3:58:37] <TerraWraith> Pat, use your own brush, but Paige, you guys kiss.
[3:58:38] <Fruitywhompus> ITS DIFFERENT
[3:58:39] <hntronium> This is just like that anime with the brother and sister
[3:58:39] <%Breakfast_Megapowers> You had been Indirectly French Kissing? @PeachSaliva
[3:58:42] <%WingBuffet> Pat's right on this one

[3:58:46] <%SulfurousAcid> but you're siblings
[3:58:47] <SuperFineButtHairs> LOOK AT PATS SAD FACE
[3:58:48] <mayorrev> that's so sad, alexa play despacito
[3:58:49] <+fearmeyer35> ? what kind of a channel amd chat is this lol
[3:58:50] <+plasmapunch> EleGiggle that makes no sense wtf
[3:58:50] <Jslicerx> How?
[3:58:50] <VanLynx> paige... you're crazy
[3:58:52] <%bloodypurpledog> Siblings share tooth brushes all the time
[3:58:53] <knomad2b> that is nasty pat
[3:58:53] <SuperFineButtHairs> IM CRYING
[3:58:53] <marrymegundamzeta> what's pat's rebuttal?
[3:58:54] <%RaikenTB> oh it's fine.
[3:58:54] <CptBritches> "I don't give a fuck" isn't an argument
[3:58:55] <Xelhesia> i mean...ur basically married so it should be fine right?
[3:58:56] <$Agami23> this is extra weird because of pats hygiene ocd
[3:58:56] <ragasquid> pat you barbarian
[3:58:57] <StarlightGalactic> no
[3:58:57] <yendoria> What would Pat do if Paige used HIS toothbrush??
[3:58:58] <AncelDeLambert> Paige is completely right, this is wierd
[3:58:58] <Bouldus> its not that bad
[3:59:00] <DedlokPM> BUT YOU TWO KISS
[3:59:01] <%SuperCasualBoom> Cried those mustard tears
[3:59:02] <%Sadira_snack_attack> no its gross

[3:59:05] <tUxUt> no
[3:59:05] <ragasquid> no
[3:59:05] <graemecrackers1> No
[3:59:06] <%MightyMaxT> I"M ON YOUR TEAM PAIGE
[3:59:06] <%Ciphris> are they still making bacon
[3:59:06] <Fruitywhompus> THAT SHIT IS GROSS
[3:59:07] <Travian_Valoris> just clean it
[3:59:07] <Prevot> FUCK NO
[3:59:09] <%Remery_> you rense it
[3:59:09] <+badchoice5> Is it though?
[3:59:10] <DirtyDeedsDunDirtCheap> NO GOD NO
[3:59:11] <Zaphire_Saucypants> depends on how fresh the brush is
[3:59:12] <CapOfAllFools> When you kiss, you're not actively scrubbing plaque off of your partner's teeth.
[3:59:12] <%WingBuffet> put your tongues all over each other's tongues
[3:59:13] <%Shotgun_Hobo1> kissing is different from using toothbrushes
[3:59:14] <Bouldus> not care
[3:59:15] <lilbreezy1155> theres a lot of germ crossover with sharing tooth brushes, people
[3:59:15] <%SulfurousAcid> you rinse it
[3:59:15] <TerraWraith> just clean it tho
[3:59:16] <EMP_Ike_Turner> nah that's white people shit
[3:59:17] <knomad2b> paige is right
[3:59:17] <seniorwhiteface> You guys kiss. gay
[3:59:17] <%Breakfast_Megapowers> Im not fine, but get a brand new Toothbrush and hide it
[3:59:18] <+Fairy_princess77> YOU LICK EACH OTHERS ASSHOLES
[3:59:18] <srkAres> i mean its not great but its not a big deal either
[3:59:19] <Graxe_> Strawpoll this.
[3:59:19] <DirtyDeedsDunDirtCheap> ONE BRUSH A PERSON
[3:59:19] <Jslicerx> Paige, how is it different though?
[3:59:19] <x24sonic> IT IS TOTALLY DIFFERENT
[3:59:21] <+plasmapunch> Yes, you properly clean it NotLikeThis
[3:59:23] <%Sadira_snack_attack> use it to scrub the toilet
[3:59:23] <Worldbrand> you don't get to decide someone else's personal boundaries what the fuck guys
[3:59:26] <%WingBuffet> but you wash the scum off the brush
[3:59:27] <x24sonic> ONE BRUSH PER PERSON
[3:59:27] <%rdark_ksu> You want to share underwear too?
[3:59:29] <$Agami23> now something of yours is in the toilet.
[3:59:29] <SuperFineButtHairs> HOW IS IT DIFFERENT??
[3:59:31] <%bloodypurpledog> SCUM sipsipGasm
[3:59:32] <+zymbusted> you cover the brush with tooth soap before youy use it anyways
[3:59:32] <StarlightGalactic> nobody fcking rinses their brushes
[3:59:32] <RedMaskBandit> lewd
[3:59:32] <AncelDeLambert> Pat is super wierd about THE GOBLINS how did he do this?
[3:59:33] <+Ryosuke91> my tongue has been all over my GF's mouth.... then theres the toothpaste to clean so idk seems good
[3:59:33] <$thewhiterice92> You're crazy
[3:59:34] <%SulfurousAcid> you lick the scum on each others teeth when you kiss
[3:59:34] <+badchoice5> Ok, 1 to side with Paige, 2 to side with Pat
[3:59:36] <+badchoice5> 2
[3:59:36] <Fruitywhompus> water isnt enough to rinse off your sins
[3:59:37] <%krawtch> wait you dont lick the other persons teeth? whats wrong with you
[3:59:37] <+Nomicro4u> you guys must not share soap either
[3:59:37] <MainMan_Jonadiah> "I ran water over it, it's fine."
[3:59:38] <MasterDecoder> So long as it's rinsed/cleaned with scalding water
[3:59:38] <hntronium> 2
[3:59:39] <SuperFineButtHairs> WHAT THE FUCK IS WROGN WITH YOU ALL
[3:59:40] <%RaikenTB> did he swirl the toothpaste in a glass?
[3:59:40] <seniorwhiteface> Use his tooth brush Right Now
[3:59:41] <graemecrackers1> What if she used your anal beads
[3:59:41] <+lethallunacyx> you're not sucking the plaque off their teeth
[3:59:41] <Mrbaconator> it is so unbelievably different
[3:59:41] <TikanZK> ONE BRUSH ONE PERSON YOU FUCKING SAVAGES
[3:59:41] <Volkrotia> Its honestly not that different
[3:59:42] <reonome> i'm surprised pat isn't weirded out about it
[3:59:43] <terminusterminal> Do you honestly think rinsing something makes it perfectly clean?
[3:59:44] <%WingBuffet> you throw out tooth brushes eventually due to wear, not because they accumulate filth or something jeez
[3:59:46] <+Great_Matsby> paige is 100% right
[3:59:46] <+zymbusted> its the same as using the same bar of soap
[3:59:49] <Snaketsu> PAIGE IS ABSOLUTELY IN THE RIGHT
[3:59:49] <DracaenaLeaf> why would you use a toothbrush with scum on it?
[3:59:49] <AlasterAngelo> ONE IS LIKE THE SCUM ON YOUR TEETH AND THE OTHER IS USING MY TOOTHBRUSH
[3:59:49] <%Breakfast_Megapowers> Pat how can you believe rinsing a brush cleans it?

[4:08:19] <%Ciphris> he might need them later
[4:08:19] <Eresus> @seniorwhiteface it isnt.. it's just the snes version with worse loading times

[4:08:36] <StarlightGalactic> 2
[4:08:37] <CapOfAllFools> Mog was my boy. Turned him into a Dragoon with the Dragoon Boots and the Genji glove, watched him Sextupple Jump Kefka to death at the end of the game.
[4:08:37] <CptBritches> He doesn't know if he needs them if he hasn't seen everything before
[4:08:38] <Bouldus> temp buffs bad
[4:08:38] <TheRagingLeo> And you're at the final boss with the mega elixir too
[4:08:39] <+Gorgen> "Its the final battle!"
[4:08:39] <SophisticHades> the goblin hoader
[4:08:40] <VanLynx> can I switch to Paige's side now?
[4:08:43] <%iwishthiswasicq> But it's just a shuriken.
[4:08:48] <%iwishthiswasicq> You just throw them.
[4:08:51] <Alseid> PAT THE DMC ITEM POLICIY APPLIES ONLY TO CHARACTER ACTION GAMES
[4:08:53] <+Equipt> Mog da best
[4:09:00] <lilbreezy1155> MOG THO
[4:09:05] <%Ciphris> i love celes but terra GETS ALL THE ATTENTION
[4:09:05] <+bri8203> food is just a temporary buff
[4:09:06] <%WingBuffet> Celes is a sick badass general supersoldier
[4:09:07] <+king_wragles> if he throws a shuriken, he will have one less shuriken!!
[4:09:12] <Graxe_> But Gogo, though.
[4:09:19] <+Flambage> @PeachSaliva Candy and Redbull is just a temp buff Pat!
[4:09:19] <AlasterAngelo> wish i could meet my real dad
[4:09:21] <+FrostMass22> I was 3 when Pat played FFVI
[4:09:34] <seniorwhiteface> FF6 LP incoming
[4:09:34] <%SuperCasualBoom> I just checked Pat you guys only played SamSho4, Tenka, and 3D shit game.
[4:09:35] <%SulfurousAcid> what's bad about the ps1 version?
[4:09:36] <Laironx3> I just want to hoard my Megaelixirs and never used them
[4:09:44] <+Superstarsage> setzer
[4:09:49] <%Breakfast_Megapowers> PS1 Final Fantasy ports are a tragedy
[4:09:50] <TheBlankAce> Real talk Umaro is the shittiest character and the best at the same time
[4:09:59] <lilbreezy1155> SETZERRRRRRR
[4:10:01] <%MightyMaxT> Setzer? From Kingdom Hearts?
[4:10:01] <mercado94> Shadow
[4:10:02] <$Agami23> setzer is in KH2 and is still a badass
[4:10:07] <Fruitywhompus> SEEETTTZEEERRRR
[4:10:07] <Eresus> @SulfurousAcid they are just ports of the snes versions with bad loading times
[4:10:07] <IgnusSTV> Setzer throws money.
[4:10:11] <%GeneralSCPatton> cheer100 cheer100 cheer100 Isn't that span of time between birth and death just a temporary buff? sbfpSetIn sbfpSetIn sbfpSetIn
[4:10:15] <lilbreezy1155> no fuck Setzer in KH
[4:10:17] <SuperFineButtHairs> setzer is the alucard looking guy?
[4:10:17] <StarlightGalactic> I feel like they've already had this conversation
[4:10:19] <%SulfurousAcid> oh
[4:10:19] <%WingBuffet> he just looks a bit more drugged out
[4:10:22] <SuperFineButtHairs> right?
[4:10:23] <CptBritches> Because Kingdom Hearts needs to be max embarrassing
[4:10:25] <LordKain187> Kefka is best
[4:10:29] <MainMan_Jonadiah> Wasn't Setzer the kid in KH?
[4:10:30] <+Equipt> he has a maddox lost shirt
[4:10:31] <%WingBuffet> more like the Amano portrait from the menus
[4:10:31] <Bouldus> kefka yeyeyeyeye
[4:10:34] <AlasterAngelo> because Nomura hates characters he didn't design
[4:10:47] <%SulfurousAcid> Setzer was the adult who was the struggle tournament champ
[4:10:57] <$Agami23> no. he is like 24 what are you talking about?
[4:10:57] <StarlightGalactic> gunpla the best
[4:11:01] <$Agami23> your thinking of seifer
[4:11:02] <+FrostMass22> @generalscpatton That should be a podcast title: "Life is just a temporary buff"
[4:11:03] <%SulfurousAcid> and tried to bribe you to take the fall
[4:11:16] <MainMan_Jonadiah> The picture of Setzer wearing a "Maddox Lost" shirt is really cracking me up.
[4:11:24] <CopperTucker> I watched the archives this weekend, while doing gunpla
[4:11:26] <CopperTucker> like a huge nerd
[4:11:28] <%SuperCasualBoom> I just checked Pat you guys only played SamSho4, Tenka, and 3D shit game.
[4:11:32] <Volkrotia> Restaurants cook bacon poorly for some reason
[4:11:33] <%rdark_ksu> Bacon can be very hit or miss
[4:11:39] <%MightyMaxT> OOOooo, okay chat. Best Breakfast food: pancakes, waffles of French Toast?
[4:11:40] <mercado94> Stetzer was in a tournament beating children with a nerf sword in kh2
[4:11:40] <+Reevesypoo> Crispy bacon is meant for sandwichs
[4:11:40] <+Nomicro4u> You would love KBBQ thick cut pork belly
[4:11:41] <+badchoice5> You have to make bacon yourself
[4:11:44] <lilbreezy1155> @SulfurousAcid which is bullshit theres literally a line in FF6 he says he would never cheat in a game
[4:11:48] <ricksaintriot> don't want bacon at all
[4:11:50] <+badchoice5> Bacon is a high variance food
[4:11:51] <Bouldus> hey i liek my chip bacon
[4:11:51] <%rdark_ksu> crispy bacon is for crumbling into an omlet
[4:11:51] <SuperFineButtHairs> cripst bacon is the best yall wrong
[4:11:52] <ECRead> THAT'S BECAUSE YOU COOK IT IN A PAN
[4:11:52] <%SulfurousAcid> I know right
[4:11:54] <ricksaintriot> bacon is a spice. i stand bay that.
[4:11:56] <%Breakfast_Megapowers> Bacon is the bedrock of all Morning foods
[4:12:02] <+zymbusted> bacon without chew is just bad
[4:12:08] <Your_Friendly_Futa> YEAH
[4:12:09] <lilbreezy1155> I absolutely loath KH Setzer
[4:12:11] <Your_Friendly_Futa> PAN COOKED BACON
[4:12:14] <ricksaintriot> bacon should be a topping.
[4:12:15] <umm_idunno> all bacon is good
[4:12:17] <CptBritches> Life is just chemicals whooaaaa
[4:12:20] <MainMan_Jonadiah> I like your elbow, cuz it rhymes with ELMO
