[0:14:46] <%thejimjamz> A peach build that isn't pure BIG AND STRONG would be interesting

[0:16:19] <%MarylandJutsu> Tennessee should be the final boss area of every game
[0:16:22] <%thejimjamz> I feel bad for the rest of the horizon team. that one guy being an ass paints them in a negative light
[0:16:29] <X2Eliah> Oh yeah thats just rural america

[0:28:42] <+kknutson4> just roll into skulls
[0:28:46] <jamsbybetty> if you stand RIGHT NEXT to those skulls and jump, your little toesies will break them
[0:28:49] <%Puhff> I love those glowing skulls as an addition
[0:28:53] <+kewlmyc> I don't even recognize the area she's in
[0:28:57] <SubjectX07x> Nah, stun his buns
[0:28:59] <%cade_calrayn> @marylandjutsu today truly is a day of Elden RINGS if ya know what I mean
[0:29:01] <theghosttcatt> why these guys get up so fast?
[0:29:02] <SubjectX07x> Easy bun stun
[0:29:03] <%Ranryu692> yeyeye bleed
[0:29:04] <tanarath> creepy49Porpkek
[0:29:04] <%Puhff> imagine if DS just had 200 souls laying around as a pick up half the time
[0:29:05] <+Grayhammatter> eh, not so real
[0:29:06] <%cade_calrayn> I woke up and was like BUNS?!?
[0:29:11] <%MarylandJutsu> @cade_calrayn I KNOW RIGHT
[0:29:13] <ZenDragoon> I just did a dungeon full of these guys, hate them
[0:29:20] <%MarylandJutsu> @cade_calrayn i'm so happy for them

[0:29:21] <SubjectX07x> It's big in PVP.
[0:29:25] <+MooseIsGoose> elmo thinks your old so bed time is now
[0:29:27] <%Puhff> it's weapon art is cool
[0:29:30] <%cade_calrayn> I thought it was like a gift at first but like woah
[0:29:30] <lettersofsky> It's a good sword
[0:29:33] <%Puhff> and bleed is stronk
[0:29:34] <tanarath> sipsipElmo
[0:29:35] <Willowight> whats it called
[0:29:35] <%AncelDeLambert> I can't stay, I'm doing stuff with friends, but I'm swinging by to support the Peaches. Big and Strong, Paige.
[0:29:39] <vehementvadr> elmo is the senile infantile
[0:29:45] <+kewlmyc> If you build dex at all, then it's the best long range sword option by a long shot. Also the weapon art is busted
[0:29:46] <%cade_calrayn> You know Anya’s been planning that for a while hahaha
[0:29:48] <Kain5707> which one is it?
[0:29:53] <$SinisterBroccoli> you should try the berserk sword
[0:29:56] <+ViktorTalonRoe> My favorite so far is the nerd katana
[0:29:57] <+Grayhammatter> bleed is kinda busted right now
[0:29:59] <%Puhff> LUL
[0:30:18] <masterkazzugos> @PeachSaliva Back in Elmo's day, bedtime was at 5:30!
[0:30:21] <tanarath> Exactly, Paige
[0:30:22] <%CptCreampuff16> thats a good saying
[0:30:22] <Kain5707> bleed right now is what Faith was in vanilla DS2
[0:30:25] <+kewlmyc> I remember Bleed being busted at the beginning of DS3
[0:30:26] <%Ranryu692> I haven't been able to find any cool weapons yet that don't involve like 40 in a stat, and it sucks
[0:30:27] <ZenDragoon> @Grayhammatter That's what they get for having blood.
[0:30:29] <SubjectX07x> As the gents said on the podcast, "This is the game where a win is a win is a win."
[0:30:33] <%imthewisejanitor> LUL
[0:30:34] <theghosttcatt> bleed is all fun and games till you fight stuff that refuses to bleed
[0:30:36] <%cade_calrayn> Alright, back from the gym, now I’m off to the final(?) zone of the game
[0:30:38] <%thejimjamz> legit thought the ghost attacked you
[0:30:39] <%Puhff> right? you're fighting 20 foot tall dudes with dragons for arms; being busted is warranted against them
[0:30:49] <%rumtumtugnutz> Jesus dinksucking goldberg
[0:31:07] <Saltedoasis> WASHED
[0:31:16] <%Puhff> oh weird, he's wearing gold. didnt notice
[0:31:19] <SubjectX07x> Is paige on PC?
[0:31:30] <%Puhff> F
[0:31:39] <niffinbox> ''these guys arent that bad''
[0:31:43] <Bloomingzonda> DId you try any of the fixes paige
[0:31:46] <Kain5707> they patched it a couple days ago
[0:31:50] <%Puhff> your PC has more tubes than Pats
[0:31:51] <%VentWilsn> Paige's PC's Big and Strong CONFIRMED
[0:31:57] <SubjectX07x> The game works very well for me as well, a fix for stutters is to go into the Nvidia control panel and change the shader cache option to unlimited.
[0:32:00] <%rumtumtugnutz> I want to get this game so I can get the Fupa armor.
[0:32:01] <tanarath> May I ask what kind of pc you have?
[0:32:04] <%Puhff> LUL
[0:32:11] <%Puhff> THAT MF SAID ALLEY OOP
[0:32:25] <%VentWilsn> no it is, its Big and Strong
[0:32:28] <%VentWilsn> dont worry
[0:32:35] <%thejimjamz> @Puhff the elden ring tactic "One-two-buckle-my-shoe"
[0:32:37] <%Puhff> i love that sneaking works no matter what kind of armor you have one
[0:32:39] <Jetsfantasy> Performance isn't based on specs right now. I know someone on a 3080 with worse performance and that's a 1400 USD card
[0:32:44] <%cade_calrayn> "These guys aren't that bad" she says 30 seconds ago
[0:32:48] <Bloomingzonda> Yeah Shader cache unlimited and Windows 11 hardware scheduling fixed the stutters for me
[0:32:49] <SubjectX07x> My one friend bought the game, was getting super mad about his frame rate being trash. Turns out his graphics drivers were a year out of date.
[0:32:56] <%cade_calrayn> These guys kicked my ASS when I got up here at the intended level lol
[0:33:03] <SubjectX07x> He updated his drivers and was golden after.
[0:33:07] <derap41> DXdiag in search
[0:33:30] <Bloomingzonda> ^
[0:33:34] <SubjectX07x> I rightfully roasted him over that one lol.
[0:33:39] <+tnomads> turning SSAO down from high to mid helped my frames a lot
[0:33:40] <%cade_calrayn> summon the Pat-uh
[0:33:41] <theghosttcatt> the shader cache and hardware thing also worked for me
[0:33:45] <SubjectX07x> dxdiag in search as the fellow said.
[0:33:45] <%MarylandJutsu> PATUHHHHHHH
[0:33:48] <%Puhff> they're strong for a reason but i dont wanna spoil
[0:33:51] <+epide> PAGE BECOME GOD
[0:34:01] <Kain5707> DXDiag or System in search
[0:34:03] <Mister_McDerp> dxdiag
[0:34:18] <%Puhff> okay first thing you do is give us your credit card #
[0:34:40] <SubjectX07x> Hrmmm, I've always heard Alienware is rather overpriced for what you get but meh, if it works it works.
[0:34:41] <%MarylandJutsu> @Puhff dont forget the magic three numbers on the back
[0:34:43] <%thejimjamz> Instructions unclear, post social security number to continue
[0:34:44] <Kain5707> and those 3 wacky digits on the back
[0:34:47] <Bloomingzonda> @PeachSaliva put DXdiag in the windows bar
[0:34:53] <%Puhff> LUL
[0:34:55] <%Puhff> you tried
[0:35:01] <%king_wragles> Oh, did Paige dip into dex or did she change the scaling on that sword?
[0:35:14] <%Puhff> a for effort
[0:35:18] <%Puhff> bish just run
[0:35:32] <lettersofsky> that combo is so cool
[0:35:32] <+tnomads> I think a lot of people's performance issues are just unrealistic expectations for how hard it is for a game engine to render the amount of things at once that Elden ring does
[0:35:32] <+Grayhammatter> yeah, i think so
[0:35:38] <jamsbybetty> Omenkiller Paige
[0:35:52] <+Grayhammatter> they're chunky bois after all
[0:36:01] <%Puhff> lil over 1k

[0:36:10] <SubjectX07x> I hate to ask this in chat but.. has paige fought the major boss in the Caelid region?
[0:36:15] <Bloomingzonda> @tnomads No it has stutter issues do to how they deal with compiling shaders. People have gotten to run on integrated GPUs
[0:36:22] <SubjectX07x> There's a REALLY good farming spot after that dude.
[0:36:24] <+epide> there not hard ones ether
[0:36:37] <+tnomads> @bloomingzonda ahh I see

[0:46:46] <%CptCreampuff16> especially other wamen
[0:46:53] <vehementvadr> I like how the tents are different colors and have different sigils on them depending on the area
[0:47:03] <CrimsonContrast> How's the adventure going paige?
[0:47:05] <marvel877> Paige loves manslaughter
[0:47:05] <+Etherealizer> are these guys all gregernented?
[0:47:13] <%nip_nips> no but they could be pregante
[0:47:29] <%Puhff> preganant?

[0:48:21] <%AncelDeLambert> mmmm, delicious geography
[0:48:31] <%MarylandJutsu> Consume map to know geography
[0:48:39] <+storebrandcandy> I can't believe how big the map is
[0:48:53] <%nip_nips> fully zoomed out my map is about two full screens
[0:48:59] <%thejimjamz> bering strait
[0:49:01] <%MarylandJutsu> yep i've found some of the underground
[0:49:05] <%MarylandJutsu> its freaking WILD
[0:49:06] <+Grayhammatter> he's... somewhere
[0:49:13] <+mythcreant> this is legit the chonkiest game
[0:49:23] <%Jellly_> may i ask to see your playtime?
[0:49:25] <%cade_calrayn> I'm at 102 hours, level 111, and all but the final 1-2 zone(s)? left, I'm a little ahead of him
[0:49:33] <+epide> LOL PAGE HE HAS LIKE 1/4TH OF THE MAP LEFT
[0:49:36] <$GreenHerbWhiteSmoke> dont look at him ITS RUDE
[0:49:39] <%MarylandJutsu> cade....kindly......what the f****
[0:49:48] <%cade_calrayn> subtract about 10 hours from that 102 because I leave the game running while working lol
[0:49:53] <UnImprest> the fact this game is the same price as breath of the wild at this moment is insane
[0:50:16] <turtlebits64> I think the bottom map may be less big than people think but still real big
[0:50:24] <%nip_nips> @cade_calrayn im at 104 hours but level 145 or so, gotta do ternado zone next but im still hunting down dungeons
[0:50:25] <%cade_calrayn> SAME
[0:50:35] <+mythcreant> no that's valid
[0:50:39] <%MarylandJutsu> YEAH
[0:50:39] <+epide> now i wonder if its all real space
[0:50:42] <+FadingEmber> game good
[0:50:45] <+mythcreant> it's finally 60+ worth of game
[0:50:46] <californaya> you want to kill them???
[0:50:46] <+Grayhammatter> it's kinda wild how much stuff is in here
[0:50:47] <+FadingEmber> simple as
[0:50:49] <%thejimjamz> even GRRM?
[0:50:49] <+epide> oh and they got raises for making this game
[0:50:59] <%VictorVonLouche> Its stupid, you just keep finding more and more GIANT zones to explore
[0:51:10] <%cade_calrayn> I was groan-laughing at you and Pat figuring out the GRRM naming last night, Paige
[0:51:13] <+HaloIsA> And the fact there's supposedly gonna be DLC
[0:51:16] <%nip_nips> you find a hidden zone, then at the end of it is ANOTHER huge hidden zone, it just keeps going
[0:51:20] <%cade_calrayn> y'all are right, all the demigods are G, R, or M names
[0:51:23] <%kyh9> I just want the dismounter sword
[0:51:26] <+FadingEmber> I'm blind now because I thought Paige was be attacked by a horse
[0:51:39] <+FadingEmber> didn't see the knight
[0:51:42] <%kyh9> The Northern Mercs will NOT give it to me
[0:51:46] <%kyh9> I've slaughtered hundreds
[0:51:51] <%kyh9> And they just won't give me their sword
[0:51:57] <+leviting> just tuned in, that's a sexy sword
[0:51:58] <%kyh9> FIFTY SEVEN
[0:52:03] <%kyh9> AND STILL ONLY 11 IN ARCANE?!
[0:52:13] <$GreenHerbWhiteSmoke> NO more strength STRONGER
[0:52:28] <%nip_nips> im at 80 strength, and only now do i think ive hit the softcap
[0:52:31] <lettersofsky> that's real sexy
[0:52:33] <+leviting> NICE
[0:52:35] <%cade_calrayn> I'm at level 111, Paige, you have plenty of time to rebalance, even before you beat the boss that gives you respec :)
[0:52:36] <+Grayhammatter> all the strength, big and strong
[0:52:42] <%kyh9> Capcom is going to DMCA for that Judgement Cut
[0:52:49] <%kyh9> Or is it Dimension Slash?
[0:52:59] <+Grayhammatter> oh yeah, the bloodhound step
[0:53:12] <+FadingEmber> alot of the pure strength weapons are underwhelming
[0:53:23] <SubjectX07x> There is an invisibility spell I know of and a staff that buffs invis spells but thas bout it.
[0:53:29] <$trackles_64> your health is huge
[0:53:30] <%Puhff> i hate those things
[0:53:34] <%Puhff> their mouths are sooo wide
[0:53:43] <%nip_nips> @FadingEmber i dont find killing dungeon bosses in 3-4 hits underwhelming LUL
[0:53:56] <%Puhff> they are neither
[0:53:57] <$trackles_64> they look like the monkeys from wizard of oz
[0:53:58] <%cade_calrayn> They're called Misbegotten, they're cursed halfbreed things
[0:54:01] <+twdlrr> lil Cockatrice dudes
[0:54:04] <%Puhff> idk what they are other than slaves in game
[0:54:12] <%cade_calrayn> the boss from Castle Morne was a Leonine Misbegotten
[0:54:21] <%Puhff> oooooh I just noticed they look like the blacksmith!!!!
[0:54:22] <JobbedBone> demis
[0:54:39] <+Grayhammatter> demi-humans
[0:54:41] <+FadingEmber> @FadingEmber I meant design wise but whateves
[0:54:41] <%AncelDeLambert> Paige, JUMP
[0:55:01] <%Puhff> bruh me too
[0:55:07] <%nip_nips> whats the name of the big spider dude enemies who materialize out of the ground and teleport? thats the only enemy i really hate
[0:55:14] <SubjectX07x> Paige... I have 120 hours in this game, I am in NG+... I STILL forget there's a jump in combat.
[0:55:16] <$trackles_64> 50 hours in and iah avent used a jump attack once
[0:55:17] <TurtlesAndTentacles> So you just never press X lol?
[0:55:18] <sirrice77> you need some sort of ranged option
[0:55:20] <%CptCreampuff16> use the hand balista
[0:55:31] <%cade_calrayn> Just build up a little Faith and get a good attack spell, Paige, the Faith talismans are light-weight
[0:55:42] <adamant1333> hello what i mis
[0:55:45] <adamant1333> s
[0:55:47] <+FadingEmber> I think you can get lightening bolt instead of a bow
[0:55:54] <+FadingEmber> if you want
[0:55:56] <SubjectX07x> I explored quite a lot, I uhh... just have a lot of free time. And a terrible sleep schedule lol.
[0:55:59] <adamant1333> hello what i miss
[0:56:00] <%MarylandJutsu> People can be AT new game plus already?
[0:56:09] <%MarylandJutsu> thats new
[0:56:13] <sirrice77> you can get lightning bolt, get the beast talisman so it scales with str
[0:56:21] <+twdlrr> oh thats interesting
[0:56:26] <%cade_calrayn> Honestly, Paige, Faith or INT is a better investment to get ranged than a bow is, because ^ and because they're lightweight
[0:56:33] <%nip_nips> its the elevator you were MEANT to take to get up here
[0:56:35] <%cade_calrayn> you can get talismans that scale with strength
[0:56:39] <%MarylandJutsu> Those aren't nerds paige. they look nothing like pat
[0:56:45] <$trackles_64> these guys are pushovers
[0:56:53] <%CptCreampuff16> youre in the late are i think
[0:57:01] <+FadingEmber> I saw one of these temple things and have no idea what they are for
[0:57:01] <%cade_calrayn> this is the Grand Lift of Dectus, it's the elevator you need two medallions to activate
[0:57:07] <Sunstalker> Hot dang, Paige is already HERE? What a mad lass
[0:57:13] <ThatChainmecha> this whole building is the elevator
[0:57:14] <+Grayhammatter> yep, big late area
[0:57:16] <SubjectX07x> Ehh, this place is like mid game.
[0:57:21] <%MarylandJutsu> man this game is really all about keys and key items huh @cade_calrayn ?
[0:57:22] <%nip_nips> this is an early-mid area
[0:57:24] <$trackles_64> technmically there is no order as such
[0:57:26] <ThatChainmecha> this is how you get here normally
[0:57:31] <%thejimjamz> That guy has completed the huge quest
[0:57:33] <%CptCreampuff16> you need to medalions to use elvator
[0:57:35] <%thejimjamz> he is quite huge
[0:57:37] <+Grayhammatter> you can keep going, i guess
[0:57:38] <%CptCreampuff16> two*
[0:57:41] <ThatChainmecha> go to the big castle
[0:57:51] <%cade_calrayn> It takes you back down to Liurnia, this is the functioning-society route between Liurnia and the Plateau
[0:57:53] <$GreenHerbWhiteSmoke> check out one of the poison swamps :)
[0:58:00] <%cade_calrayn> not the climbing-caves method you took
[0:58:00] <%MarylandJutsu> MAXIMUM COWARD
[0:58:13] <TurtlesAndTentacles> If you beat bosses dont you get told whats next?
[0:58:17] <$trackles_64> iam guessing paige has missed a lot chat?
[0:58:30] <$trackles_64> i mean the game
[0:58:31] <%MarylandJutsu> nah its fine paige
[0:58:41] <+Grayhammatter> nah, you good
[0:58:44] <californaya> he meant content, lol
[0:58:44] <SubjectX07x> No no he asked if you missed a lot of the game, you're good.
[0:58:49] <%nip_nips> she hasnt done the academy yet, and used the back door to the plateau
[0:58:57] <%Ranryu692> no, they were addressing us in the chat, not that you missed chat
[0:59:02] <SubjectX07x> Oh, okay yeah she should PROBABLY do the academy before here.
[0:59:17] <%cade_calrayn> I have a small Faith talisman that weighs nothing and it lets me do the anti-Rot spell
[0:59:23] <%MarylandJutsu> @SubjectX07x the freaky deaky evil magic school?
[0:59:28] <TurtlesAndTentacles> chat is this the floor place?
[0:59:37] <$trackles_64> i mean u can do it if your bad ass enough
[0:59:49] <ThatChainmecha> i cant even find the academy, and i already beat rahdan
[0:59:57] <$GreenHerbWhiteSmoke> nice
[1:00:01] <Slimeking_Mike> I think she should do whatever area she wants in whatever order, because this game lets you do whatever the hell you want
[1:00:04] <SubjectX07x> Yeah, that place is before here in terms of progress. Though the "functioning society" method of getting up here as it was hilariously put requires exploring all over the first few open areas.
[1:00:15] <$GreenHerbWhiteSmoke> invaded?
[1:00:15] <ThatChainmecha> id appreciate that tbh
[1:00:18] <%Puhff> portip with demi humans- if you kill the leader first, the others stop fighting
[1:00:18] <+Grayhammatter> academy takes two coins, like the lift
[1:00:23] <Strigiform> if you picked someone who only did main quest and never explored it would be starting zone -> liurnia academy -> get told to find 2 medals or alternative way up here
[1:00:23] <SubjectX07x> Or ya know, cheeky wiki diving.
[1:00:43] <Sunstalker> Academy is the Anor Londo in the lake Kappa
[1:00:50] <$GreenHerbWhiteSmoke> TK LUL
[1:00:50] <%Ranryu692> LUL
[1:01:02] <%CptCreampuff16> dont forget to equip your great rune

[1:01:07] <%rumtumtugnutz> are you ready kids
[1:01:09] <ThatChainmecha> ah, i guess i have to find those medallions then
[1:01:17] <ShogunRaven> never found that Ash of war

[1:02:27] <dan_g_v> Paige is just that good
[1:02:30] <$GreenHerbWhiteSmoke> big strong WAMEN
[1:02:42] <Sunstalker> Demi-human queens are basically free bosses. They're like what Asylum Demon used to be.
[1:02:42] <$trackles_64> talisman
[1:02:46] <$GreenHerbWhiteSmoke> fake wall
[1:02:47] <$trackles_64> ?
[1:02:50] <AnthroMetal> weak foe but bloodstain is fantastically passive aggressive lol
[1:02:53] <$GreenHerbWhiteSmoke> that wall is fake
[1:02:54] <sirrice77> @ThatChainmecha theres several of them, also idk what that person was talking about saying the academy needs medals/coins. You need a key which you can find in the lake area near the dragon. Then walk through that town to the big blue seal on the gate
[1:03:00] <$trackles_64> Not trusting chests lol
[1:03:08] <CrimsonContrast> @thatchainmecha; in limgrave instead of going to stormveil castle go to the bridge and ride north you'll reach liurna of the lakes it's in that area
[1:03:13] <%MarylandJutsu> making you BIG AND TRONGER
[1:03:15] <$trackles_64> my hp is never at maximum

[1:03:45] <%cade_calrayn> heheheh
[1:03:48] <vehementvadr> good for no hit runners
[1:03:54] <JobbedBone> jermaChomp rattigan!
[1:03:57] <sirrice77> @ThatChainmecha right also by lake area i meant the lake/swamp in liurnia not in limgrave
[1:04:02] <%Puhff> yes
[1:04:06] <%MarylandJutsu> now thats some shade cade.....but true
[1:04:06] <+CTMathiu> My favorite disney villain
[1:04:11] <%Puhff> academy has da respec
[1:04:13] <$trackles_64> map navigation is such a apain
[1:04:21] <%cade_calrayn> wait, WHAT?
[1:04:23] <SubjectX07x> Academy is that whole big castle in the middle there.
[1:04:26] <%cade_calrayn> Paige you've found a Grace I've missed
[1:04:32] <%cade_calrayn> This goddam game

[1:04:57] <$trackles_64> @cade_calrayn theres also heaps of underground stuff
[1:04:58] <SubjectX07x> @cade_calrayn Man they are all over the place, just give up and accept that you're going to miss SO many of them lol.
[1:05:00] <+Grayhammatter> flipped up, turnt upside down
[1:05:00] <+Felhad> psaBig
[1:05:13] <%rumtumtugnutz> turn down por que
[1:05:16] <+Grayhammatter> did you beat the night boss here?
[1:05:17] <$trackles_64> you killed dragon?
[1:05:22] <%cade_calrayn> Did you run past the dragon? or kill it lol
[1:05:26] <ThatChainmecha> ah, thats what i need
[1:05:38] <%cade_calrayn> The coward's route. Acceptable
[1:05:42] <%Puhff> YUOR FINGAHS
[1:05:48] <%cade_calrayn> It's what I did lol, I came back and killed him later
[1:05:52] <%Puhff> what if she them in her mouth
[1:05:53] <$trackles_64> wish they asked for feet
[1:05:55] <%CptCreampuff16> theres a south entrance
[1:05:56] <%Puhff> thatd be fucked up
[1:06:02] <SubjectX07x> Tbh, Dragons aren't tooo tough in this, their moves are VERY choreographed and their wide sweeping flame attack is always aimed at their left side.
[1:06:03] <ThatChainmecha> ah
[1:06:03] <%Puhff> put them*
[1:06:05] <niffinbox> stick finger in her eyehole
[1:06:05] <%MarylandJutsu> ma'am you have too many arms
[1:06:10] <%Ranryu692> @Puhff I... for some reason assumed that was what she was doing
[1:06:23] <ThatChainmecha> she said something diff to me, i had the dectus medallion pieces
[1:06:25] <$GreenHerbWhiteSmoke> is she telling us to go die?
[1:06:27] <Sunstalker> Oh Paige, it doesn't matter. Both sealed gates put you in the same spot in the academy. Nothing to worry about except there is value in exploring the south approach for loot
[1:06:27] <$trackles_64> Has pat already beaten it?
[1:06:30] <%Puhff> @Puhff you would, ya nasty freak
[1:06:32] <%cade_calrayn> this lady wants to smell our feet
[1:06:32] <+ReallyBigRocks> yeyeye cowardice
[1:06:49] <SubjectX07x> There's a way on the south end.
[1:06:57] <%Puhff> LUL
[1:07:01] <SubjectX07x> Yeah.
[1:07:03] <Nkmucci> you dont have the right
[1:07:05] <%cade_calrayn> @PeachSaliva no, she's telling you how to get up to the Plateau - the Ravine is the way you took, and the Lift is the elevator
[1:07:11] <$trackles_64> Front
[1:07:12] <SubjectX07x> There's a biiit more coming in the south.
[1:07:16] <$GreenHerbWhiteSmoke> big dick mode
[1:07:18] <derap41> since you're not a coward
[1:07:20] <+Felhad> They lead to the same place
[1:07:21] <Sunstalker> Both are an approach but they both put you in the exact same spot inside.
[1:07:22] <%nip_nips> the south end just takes you up to the front
[1:07:24] <$GreenHerbWhiteSmoke> yes
[1:07:25] <%CptCreampuff16> they lead to the same area
[1:07:27] <+Grayhammatter> south is pretty big pp mode
[1:07:30] <$GreenHerbWhiteSmoke> big peepee mode
[1:07:34] <%Ranryu692> no, the one north of that
[1:07:44] <+FadingEmber> I have no strong opinion one way or the other
[1:07:45] <$trackles_64> OMEGALUL
[1:07:45] <%Puhff> god I havent heard "laides" in years
[1:07:46] <%imthewisejanitor> The Grand PP
[1:07:49] <Sunstalker> There is good loot on the south side though. Always worth having a look later
[1:07:50] <%cade_calrayn> They go to the exact same place, yeah, they teleport you across the bridges to the front entrance. The bridge is broken and the main road is all overgrown
[1:07:50] <%MarylandJutsu> going both ways, you should know all about that right @cade_calrayn ? kmaHehe kmaHehe
[1:07:51] <%Puhff> ladies*

[1:09:32] <+Felhad> Wah
[1:09:34] <$GreenHerbWhiteSmoke> fake grace monkaS
[1:09:35] <$trackles_64> lucaria sounds like a pokemon
[1:09:35] <%cade_calrayn> Raya Lucario, home of the Furries
[1:09:36] <TurtlesAndTentacles> Did Paige beat godrick?
[1:09:41] <%cade_calrayn> This is Plague's castle
[1:09:46] <%Puhff> Raya Luigi
[1:09:46] <%Ranryu692> @TurtlesAndTentacles yep
[1:09:46] <$GreenHerbWhiteSmoke> grace mimic monkaW
[1:09:50] <SubjectX07x> Nah nah, just saying there's items around the academy.
[1:09:52] <+Felhad> Rayquaza Lucario
[1:09:54] <%MarylandJutsu> @cade_calrayn its full of furries?
[1:09:58] <SubjectX07x> But nothing toooo serious if I recall?
[1:09:58] <Bloomingzonda> Paige did you do the weeping peninsula castle
[1:09:59] <Sunstalker> No here is good. But explore around a bit before uusing that elevator
[1:10:07] <$trackles_64> this sucks for mele builds
[1:10:09] <+FadingEmber> the enemies here are a trip
[1:10:09] <+ccwettr123> this place is fine and cool
[1:10:12] <%Ranryu692> this is fine
[1:10:16] <TurtlesAndTentacles> @Ranryu692 coolio
[1:10:18] <%imthewisejanitor> Elmo touched your controlled while you were away, we all saw it.
[1:10:19] <Sunstalker> that seal is a teleport btw, not a fence that blocks you
[1:10:19] <%Puhff> i suggest talking to candace
[1:10:24] <$trackles_64> big magic
[1:10:25] <%cade_calrayn> @PeachSaliva the entire lake is worth exploring, but everywhere is worth it. Give the Academy a try, and if you bounce off or get bored, do somewhere else
[1:10:26] <%cade_calrayn> BUT
[1:10:26] <%Ranryu692> wait
[1:10:26] <+FadingEmber> touch grace?
[1:10:28] <ThatChainmecha> did you meet Blaad(?) again yet?
[1:10:30] <derap41> Do you know how to find maps?
[1:10:32] <Bloomingzonda> Yeah there is a cool quest in the weeping penisnsula
[1:10:33] <%Ranryu692> you could have unlocked a grace
[1:10:34] <$trackles_64> touch the grace hole
[1:10:34] <ThatChainmecha> the wolf guy
[1:10:35] <+ReallyBigRocks> you'll demolish the peninsula at this point
[1:10:46] <SubjectX07x> @cade_calrayn Yeah that's a better way to say what I wanted to lol.
[1:10:50] <$trackles_64> on altars on the road
[1:10:55] <sirrice77> i think somewhere around that main academy gate grace theres a summon sign for samurai guy, maybe
[1:10:56] <%Puhff> they do
[1:11:07] <%Puhff> zoom bish
[1:11:08] <derap41> ah that makes sense
[1:11:10] <%cade_calrayn> @PeachSaliva ride down both roads from this grace before going inside (just walk past the teleport seal) - they both have something worth finding
[1:11:10] <+FadingEmber> Paige is so proud of being a game guide
[1:11:10] <%MarylandJutsu> oh tehy're landmarks
[1:11:26] <$trackles_64> Paige writing the wiki XD
[1:11:29] <+Grayhammatter> yura is gonna have a summon sign here on the bridge
[1:11:37] <MaybeFalco> school on people with your knowledge
[1:11:37] <+emperordread> Jolly cooperation PotFriend
[1:11:43] <SulfurousAcid> Paige likes to teach
[1:11:44] <sirrice77> paige theres also stuff on the bridges you teleported past
[1:11:45] <SubjectX07x> It took me the longest time to actually notice those in the grey areas, fun fact, in NG+ all of your map stuff, locations found and such, stays.
[1:11:49] <%Puhff> Can't wait for the PeachSaliva portion of the next Vaati video
[1:12:00] <%MarylandJutsu> EVIL hogwarts
[1:12:01] <$trackles_64> remind you of anything?
[1:12:03] <%imthewisejanitor> Paige, you're the video game boy. You're the one who wins.
[1:12:04] <+ReallyBigRocks> Welcome to Dogwarts
[1:12:09] <+RedMaskBandit> lil dildos
[1:12:11] <%Ranryu692> @MarylandJutsu isn't that just Hogwarts?
[1:12:13] <ThatChainmecha> this game's bosses have been good so far with my INT/DEX build but i feel like thats going to end soon
[1:12:16] <SubjectX07x> Wait WHAT!?
[1:12:16] <TurtlesAndTentacles> Yeah
[1:12:18] <ThatChainmecha> woah really
[1:12:18] <%Puhff> YEAH

[1:12:23] <SubjectX07x> That's lit.
[1:12:24] <Aussie_Manny> It's true. Fire is weaker in rain.
[1:12:27] <%MarylandJutsu> @Ranryu692 sorry extra evil hogwarts
[1:12:27] <%cade_calrayn> @PeachSaliva go back to the grace and run past the seals before you go in
[1:12:28] <BoneSkore> oh man that's hella rad
[1:12:28] <$GreenHerbWhiteSmoke> YEP
[1:12:30] <+emperordread> Do you have anything that increases your resistance to magic damage? There's a lot of magic damage in the magic school
[1:12:30] <dan_g_v> yeyeye
[1:12:31] <%cade_calrayn> there's something worth finding
[1:12:31] <%Puhff> well, it's a lil more damage
[1:12:34] <%Puhff> but YES
[1:12:37] <Jetsfantasy> Yup, the game loves to throw lightning at you in wet environments
[1:12:37] <$GreenHerbWhiteSmoke> JUST LIKE POKEMON :)
[1:12:40] <%Puhff> not a lot
[1:12:42] <Druss_M> TECHNOLOGY
[1:12:45] <$trackles_64> its immersion building
[1:12:47] <SubjectX07x> That's still cool as hell.
[1:12:53] <+Felhad> its like +/-10%
[1:12:54] <dan_g_v> it spreads too
[1:12:56] <%MarylandJutsu> If paige notices it, then its substantial
[1:13:08] <Sunstalker> Do gravity spells do more dmg when you're falling to your death? Kappa

[1:22:54] <Reanimator83> oh hi doggy
[1:23:09] <SubjectX07x> Dogs in all dark souls games, the bane of all existence.
[1:23:37] <+tumzfestival> You're on fire, Paige! (so clever)
[1:23:39] <%imthewisejanitor> Do not go into the dog park.
[1:23:44] <$GreenHerbWhiteSmoke> shadow puzzles mokyMadge
[1:23:45] <Sunstalker> Paige, there's a hidden Golden Seed back on the big bridge you were before the elevator. Can pick it up once you're feeling done with this zone

[1:24:10] <+emperordread> I would love it if you could throw bones at the dogs to pacify them
[1:24:15] <Aussie_Manny> that was a random frame drop spike
[1:24:16] <+vexion_smh> i thought it was on my end lul
[1:24:25] <+pectusumbra> until you sit and rip them from the afterlife anyway
[1:24:40] <%cade_calrayn> Yup!
[1:24:41] <Reanimator83> Only thing I haven't killed in this is the turtles
[1:24:42] <%Ranryu692> yep
[1:24:42] <Aussie_Manny> Okay, so it wasn't the game? Good.
[1:24:47] <$trackles_64> Do it, lets adventure
[1:24:50] <%imthewisejanitor> Is the item that makes dogs nice Sniper Wolf's handkerchief?
[1:24:53] <+Grayhammatter> adventure?

[1:25:04] <+tumzfestival> Berry Cool
[1:25:12] <%cade_calrayn> You wanna get that grace before going down there so you can skip the graveyard
[1:25:21] <+Felhad> Very cool, Patches is a bro
[1:25:31] <$trackles_64> graavity magic sucks
[1:25:36] <+FadingEmber> Paige is much stronger than I was when I came here
[1:25:43] <+eviiLJK> The moment she said "Patches told me...". So gullible Peach
[1:25:46] <DracaenaLeaf> nice
[1:25:50] <$GreenHerbWhiteSmoke> Pog so skilled
[1:25:50] <+emperordread> yeah ggez
[1:25:51] <SubjectX07x> There is a kinda weird teleport in this general area but it both goes to an endgame area and requires you to die to an enemy in a specific way..
[1:25:53] <ergulor> Cool
[1:25:56] <+tumzfestival> Paige gets stronger like Allen the Alien
[1:25:59] <+RedMaskBandit> it's way below u.
[1:26:01] <+tumzfestival> ....?
[1:26:19] <%cade_calrayn> Go to the top first though
[1:26:24] <+tumzfestival> I'm not finished reading Invincible but I think...
[1:26:24] <%cade_calrayn> For the Grace
[1:26:36] <%cade_calrayn> nah you want the waterwheel thingy
[1:26:40] <$trackles_64> you can ride the wheel
[1:26:49] <+tumzfestival> Skeleton Wheel?

[1:28:06] <+eviiLJK> 58 already? Jeesus lol
[1:28:08] <%cade_calrayn> I would bump Faith to 12, so you can use the Fire Cleanse spell at least
[1:28:15] <%cade_calrayn> It cures Rot and Poison
[1:28:17] <+FadingEmber> hearsay
[1:28:41] <%cade_calrayn> And then you can put a simple talisman in your left hand slot with your shield so you can use the spell when needed
[1:28:45] <$trackles_64> shes gonna love this
[1:28:47] <SubjectX07x> @cade_calrayn Who gives you that spell? I swapped from dex int to dex faith and that sounds... useful to say the least.

[1:36:23] <%cade_calrayn> If not, you can just sprint past all the enemies to the boss door
[1:36:26] <%king_wragles> The boss run isn't bad, but there is a short cut that makes it easier
[1:36:26] <+Felhad> Paige was No Maidens before it was cool
[1:36:27] <SubjectX07x> It's just a long run dodging magey boys.
[1:36:41] <+emperordread> You can see if there is a stake neaby because it will have a little icon of the statue under your health bar

[1:46:31] <%hereiam407> Concrete boots would be a funny addition
[1:46:32] <+Etherealizer> it lets you put magic ashes of war on normal weapons IIRC
[1:46:38] <%king_wragles> Vagabond armor is a bit better, but ya
[1:46:39] <%Cozy90> @Ranryu692 thank you :)
[1:46:41] <%cade_calrayn> There's a really cool-looking armor set back in the graveyard if you wanna go looking, Paige
[1:46:41] <%hereiam407> Spooky
[1:46:46] <+Felhad> I used that til a set I got in Raya
[1:46:46] <$trackles_64> it doesnt really effect anyothing other than weightm game is fashion souls.
[1:46:51] <+eviiLJK> i think most armour in this game is just cosmetic. The boosts you get are minimal
[1:46:53] <MaybeFalco> i hate those things
[1:46:57] <+eviiLJK> so you can just Elden Bling it up
[1:47:00] <%zamatermort> Thats one of them things Patches told you about

[1:58:21] <+Axellogic> Did paige ever go to the bottom of the elevator things>
[1:58:25] <coziestbank> It's weird how 80% of this area is a side path
[1:59:01] <$GreenHerbWhiteSmoke> EZ Clap
[1:59:09] <+Archphronimos> Paige you still have kukri equipped
[1:59:13] <%hereiam407> You got this
[1:59:16] <nomolomo> paige why do you always crouch?
[1:59:18] <$GreenHerbWhiteSmoke> EZ
[1:59:23] <%thejimjamz> They put Fall Guys into this game!?
[1:59:31] <+Grayhammatter> EZ Clap
[1:59:36] <+tumzfestival> That took... Courage?
[1:59:37] <SulfurousAcid> it makes her feel sneaky I think
[1:59:43] <penitentpendant> Leave portal for a little later
[1:59:45] <coziestbank> @nomolomo Crouch is where sprint used to be, also easy to click in L3 on accident.
[1:59:46] <+Grayhammatter> that guy
[1:59:46] <%imthewisejanitor> Clap them balls
[1:59:47] <$GreenHerbWhiteSmoke> mangoHmm fight
[1:59:47] <+bone_reaper69> later
[1:59:54] <+Teilwal> You should behold the dog
[1:59:54] <penitentpendant> There's a shortcut the guy's guarding
[1:59:55] <+vexion_smh> Dog! LUL
[1:59:58] <%king_wragles> Uh... that guy has a cool thing your current build doesn't need
[2:00:02] <+FadingEmber> jmikeD3
[2:00:03] <%king_wragles> But ya, this guy is for real
[2:00:08] <%zamatermort> Just a guy
[2:00:08] <%Dakuu75> he's... a stronger guy. I guess
[2:00:08] <Spydurman> fuck you up
[2:00:09] <$GreenHerbWhiteSmoke> its a dude with some drip @PeachSaliva
[2:00:10] <+ReallyBigRocks> he's a guy, but he's cool
[2:00:12] <coziestbank> He's a G, need jump attacks
[2:00:15] <%hereiam407> He's approaching
[2:00:20] <+tumzfestival> OH FUCK
[2:00:21] <coziestbank> he loves to parry
[2:00:25] <%Ranryu692> is that... Moon Knight?
[2:00:34] <$GreenHerbWhiteSmoke> RIP

[2:00:59] <coffeeabomination> psaBig WOW
[2:01:14] <+FadingEmber> not a boss
[2:01:21] <$GreenHerbWhiteSmoke> you tired ☠️☠️☠️
[2:01:21] <Jetsfantasy> Definitely a "Welcome to Dark Souls, bitch" moment
[2:01:22] <Ell1ot> big sword punch
[2:01:23] <%cade_calrayn> He's not a boss, I don't think the icon was there
[2:01:23] <coziestbank> It only lets you summon within certain distances of a type of statue
[2:01:26] <%king_wragles> but he's a boss, even though he's not a boss
[2:01:30] <dukenux> don't worry, you know who else's a bitch? Mads Mikkelsen (also me)
[2:01:40] <Kain5707> i think this game has some major balancing issues to be fair
[2:01:41] <CH3F015> what part is this?
[2:01:44] <SulfurousAcid> is this anor lando?
[2:01:48] <%hereiam407> Clap
[2:01:49] <$GreenHerbWhiteSmoke> free
[2:01:54] <%king_wragles> @Kain5707 Part of the charm at times, imo
[2:01:58] <%Ranryu692> @CH3F015 Raya Lucaria
[2:02:01] <$GreenHerbWhiteSmoke> jelly fish
[2:02:07] <%king_wragles> Cause everything this guy does, the player can do
[2:02:08] <%hereiam407> Oh my
[2:02:18] <+Kevlar_Caviar> just moved into my new place and spent way too long trying to get my computer working, how are you lads doing on this lovely night?
[2:02:21] <+vexion_smh> @vexion_smh LUL goes to show you really can't underestimate whatever shit this game throws at you
[2:02:32] <%hereiam407> You got this
[2:02:33] <dukenux> the hardest type of boss fight - regular guy
[2:02:37] <+Grayhammatter> nicely done
[2:02:38] <%king_wragles> YE YE YE, 2nd try!
[2:02:38] <+bone_reaper69> nicee
[2:02:38] <penitentpendant> G'job!
[2:02:39] <$GreenHerbWhiteSmoke> Pog first try
[2:02:42] <SulfurousAcid> "just some guy"
[2:02:45] <Kain5707> @Kain5707 i dont know not even BB was this punishing all the time
[2:02:51] <+FadingEmber> don't get excited
[2:02:51] <%king_wragles> @PeachSaliva that is a pretty shield with decent resists
[2:03:00] <dukenux> 2dumb2block
[2:03:00] <+FadingEmber> yup
[2:03:03] <%Ranryu692> LUL
[2:03:05] <SulfurousAcid> shield for brainlords
[2:03:08] <%king_wragles> It's main draw is that it has a low str requirement
[2:03:08] <$GreenHerbWhiteSmoke> LUL too dumb for holding some metal
[2:03:09] <+tumzfestival> Paige can't figure out how to holdit properly
[2:03:20] <+RedMaskBandit> I just barely beat him rn
[2:03:22] <%king_wragles> @tumzfestival she holds it backwards
[2:03:45] <dukenux> "no no, you aren't supposed to hold it with BOTH hands"
[2:03:49] <%ospreyworks> where exactly is Peach?
[2:03:53] <%king_wragles> Only thing I'll say for this is don't let your guard down
[2:03:59] <cartakus> I'm getting overwhelmed by the "side" content of this game
[2:04:00] <%cade_calrayn> @ospreyworks near the end of the Academy
[2:04:02] <signofzeta> librarby
[2:04:04] <SubjectX07x> First phase of this boss is a gimmick, also this intro is weird.
[2:04:07] <Bloomingzonda> @ospreyworks A lot of peaches are in georgia
[2:04:07] <+FadingEmber> jmikeD3
[2:04:09] <%Dakuu75> this is the real-shit
[2:04:10] <$GreenHerbWhiteSmoke> its two people if i recall correctly
[2:04:11] <%cade_calrayn> Just have fun, Paige
[2:04:19] <derap41> Give it a shot
[2:04:20] <%cade_calrayn> Don't spoil the fight though guys
[2:04:20] <%hereiam407> Lying berrys
[2:04:20] <coziestbank> 2nd phase is only hard because of adds
[2:04:23] <mikesapartment> be aggressive!
[2:04:27] <%nip_nips> no hints
[2:04:27] <%ospreyworks> oh wow, @cade_calrayn she's covered a lot of ground
[2:04:27] <vehementvadr> the easiest boss ever Kappa
[2:04:29] <Pookiedaexzile> Its your Favored Enemy
[2:04:31] <%king_wragles> Just don't be silly, and it's an easy first phase
[2:04:31] <signofzeta> i'd say medium difficulty
[2:04:33] <eduwardovich> gl dd

[2:05:56] <%vivaldiva> ~ Words that kill ~
[2:05:58] <%Puhff> no just gold ones
[2:05:58] <derap41> Who Throws books at people
[2:05:59] <%king_wragles> you had it right at first
[2:06:04] <%hereiam407> Creepy as hell
[2:06:06] <%imthewisejanitor> This is a fucking nightmare. I've never played a Souls game in my life and I'm so buying this now.
[2:06:16] <$trackles_64> big damage
[2:06:20] <+tumzfestival> TAKE IT
[2:06:21] <%hereiam407> Who thinks of this awesome shit when they work
[2:06:27] <+RedMaskBandit> reminds me of the amrita in Nioh.
[2:06:30] <+Grayhammatter> wow, that was cool
[2:06:38] <+tumzfestival> WHACK
[2:06:38] <%king_wragles> You think she noticed, chat?
[2:06:46] <SubjectX07x> You can find the glowy onces based off of them singing.
[2:06:52] <%cade_calrayn> and the books
[2:06:54] <%king_wragles> OH COME ON
[2:06:55] <$trackles_64> this is the prettiest boss battle
[2:07:03] <coffeeabomination> Are the adds going to the rapture now?
[2:07:09] <+FadingEmber> a lot of people in chat seem to be seeing this for the first time
[2:07:12] <%Cozy90> i love the setting for the next park of this fight
[2:07:16] <%king_wragles> @coffeeabomination they got turned into an attack that whiffed
[2:07:25] <%hereiam407> @FadingEmber I haven't played this game yet
[2:07:27] <megaman_sentinel> this Harry Potter movie sure looks different
[2:07:31] <dukenux> this feels eerie
[2:07:33] <derap41> Are they singing Ring around the Roses?
[2:07:34] <+pectusumbra> My first time seeing it. This is weird shit for sure
[2:08:17] <+FadingEmber> @hereiam407 LUL I hope you are okay with spoilers then
[2:08:19] <derap41> Why even use lockon
[2:08:20] <$trackles_64> curved swords lol
[2:08:22] <dukenux> there's a lot weird shit in Souls, but this legit feels like a dream
[2:08:24] <penitentpendant> First try!
[2:08:29] <%Cozy90> i love this phase. its so pretty
[2:08:31] <SubjectX07x> Alright, phase two, get ready to dodge BIG LASERS.
[2:08:32] <+ReallyBigRocks> congrats you win
[2:08:32] <%nip_nips> so easy Kappa
[2:08:34] <+FadingEmber> jmikeD3
[2:08:36] <%king_wragles> Even with spoilers, this game feels good to play
[2:08:38] <$GreenHerbWhiteSmoke> first try PogBones
[2:08:38] <%imthewisejanitor> EZ BB
[2:08:48] <$GreenHerbWhiteSmoke> look at her stupid hat
[2:08:48] <%hereiam407> @FadingEmber Absolutely, I've only caught streams here or there. I'll forget about this by the time I play in six months
[2:08:56] <%king_wragles> Btw, this fight is rad AF
[2:08:57] <+deathwatch308> Prepare for trouble
[2:08:57] <signofzeta> love her stupid hat
[2:08:59] <$GreenHerbWhiteSmoke> look at how stupid it is
[2:09:07] <+deathwatch308> AND MAKE IT DOUBLE
[2:09:12] <dukenux> The Strands
[2:09:14] <megaman_sentinel> special Bean Cannon
[2:09:15] <%king_wragles> YOU READY PEACH?
[2:09:15] <%imthewisejanitor> Take BB to the furnace!
[2:09:15] <$trackles_64> demon baby
[2:09:18] <SubjectX07x> Ah yes, and here comes best girl to try and help her mommy.
[2:09:20] <%king_wragles> ARE YOU FUKIN READY?
[2:09:21] <$GreenHerbWhiteSmoke> dead baby became the boss monkaS
[2:09:22] <%hereiam407> It's the goo
[2:09:23] <tanarath> :)
[2:09:42] <+eviiLJK> oh this stage is so cool
[2:09:42] <%cade_calrayn> @PeachSaliva Ranni the Witch is the blue doll lady who gave you torrent
[2:09:53] <SulfurousAcid> MOON
[2:09:53] <signofzeta> bayonetta 4 leaked
[2:09:54] <kirbykyodai> she's got a bugle for a hat
[2:09:55] <SubjectX07x> @cade_calrayn Aight that's.. a bit much on spoilers man.
[2:09:55] <%hereiam407> Cool
[2:09:55] <dukenux> FLYYY ME TO THE MOON
[2:09:56] <%nip_nips> ranni gives the summon bell, not torrent
[2:09:57] <$trackles_64> Prettiest scene
[2:09:57] <Jetsfantasy> Major bayonetta vibes
[2:09:59] <tanarath> YEAH
[2:09:59] <%imthewisejanitor> Far AND wide?
[2:10:00] <Firststrike_OW> sick stage
[2:10:02] <$GreenHerbWhiteSmoke> woah its a bayonetta stage
[2:10:07] <SubjectX07x> She lies about her name when she first meets you.
[2:10:07] <%cade_calrayn> @SubjectX07x pretty sure she's met Ranni already
[2:10:08] <+deathwatch308> best boss room in the game imo
[2:10:09] <eduwardovich> She seems super tall, but her head is tiny...
[2:10:11] <Pookiedaexzile> When your daughter starts talking shit in Your Boss fight
[2:10:13] <+vexion_smh> WOAH
[2:10:16] <%hereiam407> How very Killer is Dead of you
[2:10:17] <SulfurousAcid> big fuckoff lazer got it
[2:10:20] <%king_wragles> @SubjectX07x it's not spoilers if they're getting names wrong lol
[2:10:21] <%Cozy90> def the prettiest boss fight
[2:10:21] <%cade_calrayn> Bayonetta's mom energy
[2:10:22] <coziestbank> Boy I didn't even notice you are not fighting the Queen herself but a conjuration of Ranni here.
[2:10:26] <+Infernal_Dalek> I saw somebody cast that kamehameha
[2:10:26] <+FadingEmber> @cade_calrayn ...by a different name dude
[2:10:27] <coffeeabomination> So moonlight greatsword WHEN?
[2:10:29] <derap41> Keep rolling rolling rolling
[2:10:30] <tacostarvedbeast> Bayonetta if she was a huge nerd vibes
[2:10:32] <+pectusumbra> It's the Rom stage
[2:10:33] <%king_wragles> Imagine trying to do lore drops, but fucking up who has which names lmao
[2:10:35] <turtlebits64> I love how freakishly long everyone's arms are especially hers
[2:10:35] <$GreenHerbWhiteSmoke> gotta close the distance :)
[2:10:36] <penitentpendant> Good job on the first phase though
[2:10:36] <%cade_calrayn> also knowing Paige she won't even remember the name lol
[2:10:37] <$trackles_64> shall we start the timer?
[2:10:38] <+Rellim80> Um, mommy?
[2:10:45] <tanarath> This fight is great
[2:10:45] <SulfurousAcid> librarian bayonetta
[2:10:50] <olaksi> @cade_calrayn Not to be confused with Renna. I think the confusing naming of all the characters is a huge GRRM contribution
[2:10:52] <SubjectX07x> @cade_calrayn This... is a fair point.
[2:10:53] <%nip_nips> @coffeeabomination waaaay later
[2:10:59] <penitentpendant> Your runes are in the boss room
[2:11:01] <SubjectX07x> She's got pretty low HP.
[2:11:06] <moonmintparadise> you can do it
[2:11:06] <SubjectX07x> She just hits like a truck.
[2:11:06] <+RedMaskBandit> Bayonetta boss time
[2:11:07] <+ccwettr123> you can do it, its 90% dodgin
[2:11:10] <%king_wragles> She's a glass cannon
[2:11:11] <+FadingEmber> I beat it a lower level then you
[2:11:11] <%nip_nips> shes squishy
[2:11:13] <WebmanJax> Hurray! I'm not bad! I died to the NPC so many times but beat her first try.
[2:11:14] <jkips56> She’s not too tanky
[2:11:15] <+deathwatch308> @PeachSaliva youre gonna need as many heals as possible in the second phase
[2:11:17] <%Sotetsu> You're strong enough, you just need practice
[2:11:17] <$trackles_64> you need less armoor so u cn dodge
[2:11:18] <moonmintparadise> you could try summons
[2:11:19] <+pectusumbra> It's a gunfight
[2:11:20] <$GreenHerbWhiteSmoke> i think that she's talked enough shit about you
[2:11:21] <%king_wragles> There is a consumable you can MAKE that makes the fight a bit easier
[2:11:22] <+FadingEmber> summons will help @PeachSaliva
[2:11:22] <jkips56> You can take her
[2:11:23] <tanarath> Physic + Summon can be done just before she transitions to PHASE 2
[2:11:28] <megaman_sentinel> she's a glass Cannon
[2:11:28] <SulfurousAcid> she is tough, but you are BIG and STRONG
[2:11:30] <coziestbank> The repec feature is locked behind beating her if you care about that.
[2:11:31] <+CashewZero> You’re plenty qualified, just need to learn where to dodge
[2:11:31] <+ReallyBigRocks> it would make it easier, but there's no reason you can't do it now
[2:11:36] <juan_wu_tamad> just gotta schmoove paige
[2:11:40] <%cade_calrayn> target the gold auras in the first phase, Paige, if you didn't catch that
[2:11:40] <%thejimjamz> Peach! you gotta kill evil sailor moon!
[2:11:40] <SubjectX07x> By the way, you don't have to kill ALL of those small versions, just the ones that glow.
[2:11:42] <%king_wragles> Spellproof liver, increase magic resist
[2:11:54] <+shootbang_exe> I think you missed opening a shortcut by going a different direction after killing the knight
[2:11:55] <%king_wragles> AW FUCK
[2:11:58] <baronvonbirman> Atleast you're not a sorcerer, this sucked as astrologer.
[2:12:01] <+RedMaskBandit> there's still more to the zone.
[2:12:02] <%king_wragles> I'm sorry Peach, I think you missed it
[2:12:06] <coziestbank> You can also use a rune arc
[2:12:06] <+leviting> I think she has one of those
[2:12:12] <coziestbank> if you equip the great rune
[2:12:20] <+ccwettr123> there is a talisman that does it, but you dont have it
[2:12:24] <+ccwettr123> I think Pat does?
[2:12:26] <+bone_reaper69> there is 1 path here you missed, not sure if you mind
[2:12:28] <%cade_calrayn> Also yeah, equip a Great Rune at the Grace and use a Run Arc
[2:12:29] <+deathwatch308> it would be next to the fire talisman
[2:12:32] <DynzelWashington> If you go super aggressive is can semi stunlock her cause she has such low poise.
[2:12:49] <coziestbank> Great rune will raise all your stats
[2:12:50] <+FadingEmber> you got this just summon first
[2:12:56] <%Ranryu692> Paige did you ever awaken Godrick's rune?
[2:12:56] <SubjectX07x> She is hilariously stun lockable.
[2:12:59] <+ReallyBigRocks> it's fine, you're plenty strong enough to win as is
[2:13:00] <tanarath> but yeah, paige, what do you think of this boss's vibe & aesthetic?
[2:13:08] <coziestbank> oohhh
[2:13:16] <%king_wragles> Prettiest fight so far
[2:13:24] <coziestbank> It does help a lot
[2:13:29] <+deathwatch308> do it now then use the rune fragment to get as GOOD buff
[2:13:29] <+Grayhammatter> might be a good idea
[2:13:33] <%cade_calrayn> You should, yeah, but you can beat her as you are
[2:13:37] <jkips56> Yea awakening the rune helps
[2:13:42] <coziestbank> Also those rune effects last until you die, you can even teleport and keep them going.
[2:13:51] <%Dakuu75> I think you should. it gives you a big boost when you use the rune arc
[2:14:05] <+ccwettr123> as far as I can tell, runes do nothing unless you use a rune arc anyway
[2:14:08] <SubjectX07x> So do we know if Paige has met Ranni or no? And no, I don't mean if she's met Renna.
[2:14:10] <+deathwatch308> prayer time

[2:28:33] <+ccwettr123> that's why you dont sleep with dead people
[2:28:33] <+Grayhammatter> rip bozo
[2:28:35] <%imthewisejanitor> I'm not gonna remember all that, Fia. Send them an email.

[2:28:37] <dukenux> Peace.
[2:28:40] <coziestbank> She just wants people to be able to die again.
[2:28:41] <+Grayhammatter> she peaced

[2:28:55] <Aussie_Manny> khadSnap Later, nerd.
[2:28:57] <%nip_nips> no more booba in face?
[2:28:59] <oda_flobunaga> D didn't like undead, Fia likes undead
[2:28:59] <%Puhff> I've watched Pat do her whole quest and I looked up the ending. I still dont get what she's really doing.
[2:29:02] <%cade_calrayn> it's complicated
[2:29:02] <ThatChainmecha> no
[2:29:03] <SubjectX07x> Yeah she's not as crazy as she sounds..
[2:29:06] <ZenDragoon> the deathbed companion was one of the like... 5 bosses eluded to in the opening
[2:29:06] <penitentpendant> This is quest progression
[2:29:06] <%nip_nips> this is the way the quest works
[2:29:07] <greasypete00> this is part of Fia's quest
[2:29:07] <Oscarthemowerman> his name was D but it should have been F :(
[2:29:07] <oda_flobunaga> No, you good
[2:29:08] <sirrice77> okay she likes the skeleton people, D says no skeletons, so she killed him
[2:29:09] <ThatChainmecha> it opens a new possible path
[2:29:12] <%Puhff> Other than "helping" Godwyn
[2:29:18] <SubjectX07x> @Puhff I could explain it, it's not that complicated.
[2:29:18] <%cade_calrayn> she like... opposes the concept of "Destined Death", I believe
[2:29:23] <ThatChainmecha> Deez Nuts
[2:29:26] <dukenux> Double D
[2:29:29] <dukenux> Jawbreakers
[2:29:32] <coziestbank> His conjoined brother was dead.
[2:29:34] <+tumzfestival> Find the D Paige
[2:29:37] <%imthewisejanitor> Mama?? Lockne??
[2:29:39] <+Fetrigon> man she spittin KomodoHype KomodoHype KomodoHype
[2:29:44] <ThatChainmecha> its heavy thouhg
[2:29:46] <%thejimjamz> but you got that ring tho
[2:29:49] <ThatChainmecha> i cant use this armor
[2:29:52] <dukenux> yeah, but it looks COOL
[2:29:58] <+Rellim80> No more hugs? Bullshit.
[2:30:02] <greasypete00> do you have the arsenal charm or whatever that one talisman is?
[2:30:02] <+FadingEmber> gotta try it on
[2:30:05] <Oscarthemowerman> i love the helm, the rest is just ok
[2:30:10] <%Puhff> @SubjectX07x pls do
[2:30:13] <coziestbank> The funny thing is if you do this ineraction he'll kill her instead.
[2:30:14] <+Grayhammatter> incredibly overencumbered XD
[2:30:18] <coziestbank> *Don't do
[2:30:24] <greasypete00> wait check talismans
[2:30:31] <+OJHogger> wait huh how did you get Ds armour
[2:30:43] <+RedMaskBandit> Lil D if you would.
[2:30:46] <ThatChainmecha> Fia sidequest O
[2:30:48] <$FrostedZaibatsu> D stands for Dead
[2:30:53] <azure_dunes> equip load talisman is amazing tbh
[2:30:55] <+ccwettr123> @PeachSaliva not sure if you have any yet, but some armor has special abilities such as increasing stats or decreasing spell cost.  Worth reading the descriptions to see
[2:31:14] <ThatChainmecha> keep hugging Fia to start her sidequest @OJHogger
[2:31:33] <%CptCreampuff16> talisma
[2:31:38] <sirrice77> You were probably wearing something that increased dex
[2:31:42] <%CptCreampuff16> you gotta put your seal talisman back on
[2:31:46] <Kain5707> swap out the jump attack artifact
[2:31:49] <heartlesshealer> oh right the trinket
[2:32:04] <ThatChainmecha> top right
[2:32:06] <%king_wragles> @PeachSaliva go talk to finger lady real quick, sorry for the back seat
[2:32:12] <ThatChainmecha> you can get better ones of those
[2:32:17] <Kain5707> big and strong
[2:32:26] <%G_Thunders> It feels super jank that none of the people want to talk about the murder and crazy speech that happened like 20 feet away
[2:32:29] <%king_wragles> Ye
[2:32:32] <azure_dunes> try finger but hole
[2:32:36] <dukenux> "Finger lady"
[2:32:40] <%king_wragles> It's awful! But really cool!
[2:32:41] <+ccwettr123> tbh this game is SO big, not sure back seating outside of build/combat is really a problem
[2:32:42] <+pectusumbra> Let's be fair, it's a Soulsgame NPC sidequest bullshit
[2:32:58] <heartlesshealer> O' Finger!
[2:33:02] <+ccwettr123> unsure if those are needed for endings
[2:33:04] <%king_wragles> Wait, why isn't she giving the pouch?
[2:33:05] <Aussie_Manny> Remembrance of the Garfield.
[2:33:06] <+Fadedblank247> you can clone the boss souls pretty east
[2:33:07] <%cade_calrayn> Are you gonna use any of the items, Paige? If not, ignore those
[2:33:10] <+eviiLJK> BEAR WITNESS
[2:33:12] <+FadingEmber> you can copy this souls
[2:33:13] <+Axellogic> You can get extra remembrances
[2:33:15] <oda_flobunaga> No
[2:33:16] <cartakus> the dragon does not live to the hype tbh
[2:33:16] <%cade_calrayn> @king_wragles she hasn't beaten a second shardbearer
[2:33:17] <%zamatermort> It is just a boss soul
[2:33:21] <$GreenHerbWhiteSmoke> bye everyone have a good night
[2:33:22] <greasypete00> she hasnt beaten rennala yet I guess @king_wragles
[2:33:23] <+twenty112> Did you dupe the soul at a cathedral?
[2:33:24] <+Fadedblank247> gives u an extra one
[2:33:25] <oda_flobunaga> Gives you 2
[2:33:26] <+FadingEmber> you get both weapons
[2:33:26] <Sunstalker> Get all the weapons
[2:33:27] <+pectusumbra> Let's you get both things if you want them both
[2:33:29] <azure_dunes> then you could have TWO DRAGON ARMS
[2:33:32] <Strigiform> theres a system to replicate remembrances, even after using them
[2:33:32] <%CptCreampuff16> it dupes the item
[2:33:32] <+Grayhammatter> gives you an extra one
[2:33:32] <ergulor> allow you to create 2 boss weapons
[2:33:33] <%king_wragles> @greasypete00 DUH
[2:33:34] <ThatChainmecha> its just poopoo man
[2:33:35] <+ccwettr123> its if you want multiple weapons iwth the same soul at the same time
[2:33:36] <%cade_calrayn> it's so that you can get a second copy, so you can get both weapons/items
[2:33:40] <+Nekros4442> Cloning rememrance lets you create both the boss rewards
[2:33:41] <+twenty112> You can get both items or two souls to crush for big levels
[2:33:41] <godlesscruelty> dupe souls, double boss weapons, power stance them
[2:33:42] <heartlesshealer> I still love Behold! just placed at the foot of a turtle
[2:33:45] <+Felhad> @azure_dunes nope, cant pick the same option in 1 playthrough
[2:34:02] <+Felhad> You can get both but not double up
[2:34:05] <ZenDragoon> The game only lets you have 1 dragon until ng+ I think
[2:34:05] <%cade_calrayn> @PeachSaliva Remember how in DS3 how you could only choose one per boss soul? They basically said "hey let's give you the option to get both this time"
[2:34:06] <%king_wragles> I thought you beat Rennalia, my bad
[2:34:09] <azure_dunes> dang that's sad
[2:34:23] <+FadingEmber> LUL only Paige would think to get 2 dragon fists
[2:34:25] <sirrice77> okay the soul duping just makes a copy of the soul and uses up the place. Thats it, costs nothing except you cant  use the same place twice
[2:34:34] <%cade_calrayn> Like how Vordt had a hammer and something else, and you chose the hammer
[2:34:37] <sirrice77> So theres a limited amount of duping
[2:34:49] <ThatChainmecha> i havent seen a boss soul yet that doesnt cater to STR, sucks as a DEX and INT user
[2:34:52] <+Felhad> 8 remembrances, 6 dupes
[2:34:58] <%Puhff> dpesnt help that it all looks the same
[2:34:59] <ThatChainmecha> oh yeah did you talk to Rogier yet?
[2:35:01] <+Fadedblank247> yeah you can even dupe souls you've already spent
[2:35:09] <ThatChainmecha> balcony
[2:35:10] <%CptCreampuff16> balcony
[2:35:12] <greasypete00> balcony in here
[2:35:16] <+FadingEmber> balcony
[2:35:16] <ThatChainmecha> other way
[2:35:17] <+Felhad> yup
[2:35:17] <%cade_calrayn> Balcony opposite the Fingers
[2:35:19] <+pectusumbra> I think he was sleeping on the balcony
[2:35:26] <%Puhff> DA FINGAHS
[2:35:28] <%king_wragles> Yep, don't even need to make 2 fist weapons
[2:35:31] <+Fadedblank247> yeah you should be good
[2:35:34] <%Puhff> god i cant believe theyre just fingers
[2:35:35] <+Nekros4442> yes you can just take em
[2:35:35] <%cade_calrayn> Yeah, pick which one you want
[2:35:36] <+pectusumbra> I would still choose which one you want first anyway
[2:35:39] <heartlesshealer> eventually yes, but choose the one you want to have NOW
[2:35:41] <oda_flobunaga> This is going to get really bad in the dungeons designed with multiple floors with near identically floor plans
[2:35:41] <+FadingEmber> pick one now and one can be obtained later
[2:35:45] <+Grayhammatter> pick one
[2:35:46] <%Puhff> what tjhe absolute fuck
[2:35:48] <%king_wragles> You choose which one you get first
[2:35:49] <%cade_calrayn> Pick one, get the other later
[2:35:50] <+ccwettr123> not sure we even know all the ending requirements, so I'd say go ahead and don't worry
[2:35:50] <ThatChainmecha> choose
[2:35:51] <Sunstalker> For some reason I can't get the option to get godrick's second soul from any mausoleum
[2:35:52] <greasypete00> you can get both but not right now
[2:35:52] <+pectusumbra> Pick one now, get the other one later
[2:35:52] <oda_flobunaga> Choose
[2:35:52] <%zamatermort> You pick
[2:35:55] <%Puhff> you choose
[2:35:57] <oda_flobunaga> Choese
[2:35:58] <+Nekros4442> No you choose between them now, you can dupe it later
[2:35:59] <juan_wu_tamad> choese
[2:36:00] <heartlesshealer> pick one now, get other later
[2:36:01] <%cade_calrayn> You get the other one *later*
[2:36:03] <%Agami23> you pick one then later you cna make a copy of the soul to get the other
[2:36:04] <+FadingEmber> yes
[2:36:07] <%cade_calrayn> Yes
[2:36:09] <fumbles_tho> choose
[2:36:14] <greasypete00> the axe is cool
[2:36:16] <penitentpendant> You can retroactively clone God souls. Pat found it out on his stream.
[2:36:20] <%cade_calrayn> Pinky promise. Pat even saw it yesterday!
[2:36:22] <%king_wragles> Graft dragon is a fist weapon for fast punchy folk
[2:36:22] <+pectusumbra> the dragon head does need faith as well
[2:36:24] <%Puhff> yeah the dragon fist is more of a faith weapon
[2:36:28] <%FemmeAndroid> You’ll be able to get the other one.  It’s cool.
[2:36:29] <heartlesshealer> Pat found the dupe method on stream, you can find it for sure
[2:36:34] <%Puhff> READ AXE LORE PLS
[2:36:40] <Bloomingzonda> @PeachSaliva The dragon is also faith
[2:36:43] <%king_wragles> Add extra ham
[2:36:44] <+Felhad> hamtime
[2:36:47] <heartlesshealer> oooh sandwich
[2:36:52] <%Ranryu692> ham sandwich? nice reference
[2:36:54] <%Puhff> pat's the sandwich
[2:37:02] <%blaccbird914> Sammich PogChamp
[2:37:03] <+FadingEmber> don't drown it in mustard
[2:37:10] <%Puhff> drown it in mustard
[2:37:15] <MaybeFalco> especially drown it in mustard
[2:37:20] <%king_wragles> Soak the bread in that gross mustard water
[2:37:29] <MaybeFalco> no other condiments
[2:37:34] <%king_wragles> Add mustard seed to enhance texture and strengthen teeth
[2:37:36] <cartakus> sooooooo the end of hug lady's quest huh?
[2:37:47] <%king_wragles> Actually, forget the ham and the bread. Just eat mustard, it has protein!
[2:37:49] <%Puhff> have a little ham with your mustard hyuck hyuck
[2:38:05] <cartakus> It's really interesting what it set ups
[2:38:13] <%Puhff> SAHNIC
[2:39:21] <%Puhff> i hope in the DLC we go to the Land of Reeds and Elden Ring becomes Sekiro 2
[2:40:51] <SubjectX07x> @cartakus That's not the end of it, unless you mean the ACTUAL end.
[2:41:20] <Bloomingzonda> Is stream cursed for anyone else
[2:41:28] <SubjectX07x> Nah mine's good.

[2:43:35] <%CptCreampuff16> hello todat
[2:43:39] <heartlesshealer> hello ham sandwich
[2:43:43] <@MelBrooksKA> Wah
[2:43:46] <+Grayhammatter> hello today
[2:43:54] <%CptCreampuff16> just eat the ham
[2:43:58] <%imthewisejanitor> Wah
[2:44:04] <%zamatermort> Just the ham
[2:44:19] <SubjectX07x> His legs are all deathed up.
[2:44:20] <Bloomingzonda> You saw his blood stain
[2:44:21] <%nip_nips> because he stinky
[2:44:22] <%king_wragles> He's a bit fucked up
[2:44:23] <%cade_calrayn> he got stabbed through the spine
[2:44:24] <%hereiam407> Lt. Dan, you ain't got no legs
[2:44:25] <+vexion_smh> monkaS
[2:44:26] <%king_wragles> But he's a cool guy
[2:44:29] <+ReallyBigRocks> he shidded
[2:44:31] <%cade_calrayn> something attacked him and crippled him
[2:44:31] <sirrice77> I think he has like magic necrosis in his legs
[2:44:33] <SubjectX07x> Kinda like what happened to D back there.
[2:44:34] <+Felhad> His legs got fucked
[2:44:37] <+Grayhammatter> slowly dying
[2:44:41] <heartlesshealer> he has to sit on the toilet paige, there's no hand rails in medieval castle
[2:44:41] <SubjectX07x> But just in the legs.
[2:44:45] <%hermitdab> where that hand at
[2:44:48] <AnthroMetal> the rot
[2:44:50] <heartlesshealer> that or legs yeah
[2:44:52] <Bloomingzonda> @PeachSaliva remember the wierd bloodstain  in the alley at the castle by the dragon face
[2:44:55] <AnthroMetal> uhhh
[2:45:03] <AnthroMetal> lol
[2:45:05] <SubjectX07x> This dude kinda points you towards part of Fia's quest as well as another quest line.
[2:45:21] <+Rellim80> Biggest Diappy
[2:45:28] <SubjectX07x> The other quest line is probably the longest in the game.
[2:46:23] <heartlesshealer> hmm
[2:46:31] <SubjectX07x> I started this game as a dex build so getting that +8 rapier that early blew my mind.
[2:46:47] <SubjectX07x> Because I talked to him right after killing godrick.
[2:46:48] <+Maleicus> its a neat trick
[2:46:51] <SubjectX07x> It's magic.
[2:47:06] <+YabbaTroll> yo where tf do you find sorcerer rogier?
[2:47:09] <tanarath> You have to cheat once every 10-14 days to reset your metabolism, it's fine
[2:47:11] <%CptCreampuff16> yes
[2:47:15] <+YabbaTroll> i didnt know he was a merchant
[2:47:18] <Bloomingzonda> Glintstone is a good spell if you want to use magic instead of a bow for range
[2:47:18] <%SveriSageAdvice> @YabbaTroll church in the Stormveil Castle
[2:47:20] <SubjectX07x> I don't think you can change the ash of war on this weapon.
[2:47:33] <+ccwettr123> most unique/ boss weapons have unique ashes
[2:47:43] <+YabbaTroll> @SveriSageAdvice like the one all the way up top? I never found him there
[2:47:50] <ThatChainmecha> pass time
[2:47:55] <ThatChainmecha> keep talking to him
[2:48:13] <%SveriSageAdvice> @YabbaTroll from the Rampart Tower towards inward to the castle you should see the roof part of it that you can get to from there
[2:48:20] <%SveriSageAdvice> along the rampart
[2:48:24] <ThatChainmecha> oh dang
[2:48:26] <SubjectX07x> So rogier's quest leads to both Fia's quest and another quest, and in all reality you probably sequence broke a large portion of it meeting him this late.
[2:48:28] <ThatChainmecha> worked for me
[2:48:32] <%CptCreampuff16> talk to fia i think
[2:48:34] <ThatChainmecha> he fell asleep right after
[2:48:34] <+YabbaTroll> @SveriSageAdvice Alright ty ty
[2:48:37] <%SveriSageAdvice> np
[2:48:39] <SubjectX07x> Fia gone
[2:48:41] <heartlesshealer> guess there was another step
[2:48:43] <SubjectX07x> She gone gone.
[2:48:45] <ThatChainmecha> and then gave a letter after that
[2:48:48] <ThatChainmecha> Fia is gone
[2:48:57] <sirrice77> dont worry about it
[2:49:02] <SubjectX07x> And she's probably the only person who'd tell you this so... I can tell you where you need to go to continue his stuff..
[2:49:11] <+HaloIsA> Nah youre not
[2:49:11] <sirrice77> its just rogier points you towards fias quest but you aren't screwed
[2:49:17] <SubjectX07x> Black Knife Catacombs.
[2:49:23] <ThatChainmecha> he gives you a hat
[2:49:29] <SubjectX07x> Uhhh... hoo boy.
[2:49:32] <SubjectX07x> I'd need to see the map.
[2:49:41] <SubjectX07x> Northern part of Lirunia.
[2:49:46] <+Fetrigon> yea it's game over Paige. gonna have to restart from the beginning creepy49Porporu creepy49Porporu creepy49Porporu creepy49Porporu
[2:49:46] <SubjectX07x> In a small canyon.
[2:49:47] <%SveriSageAdvice> Black Knife Catacombs is towards the Lift, northern part along the cliffside
[2:49:49] <heartlesshealer> I'm only guessing about activating Rogier talk, I am not certain. I meant something other players naturally do that we overlook or something
[2:49:54] <%CptCreampuff16> north east part of liurna
[2:49:55] <sirrice77> north eastern cornor
[2:49:57] <SubjectX07x> By that tree.
[2:50:00] <%SveriSageAdvice> right next to that erdtree you pointed at
[2:50:03] <SubjectX07x> That canyon right by that tree.
[2:50:04] <Sunstalker> no east
[2:50:07] <ThatChainmecha> i haven't beaten a single catacomb yet lol
[2:50:11] <Sunstalker> Right of the tree
[2:50:13] <SubjectX07x> Yeahg
[2:50:14] <%SveriSageAdvice> yes there
[2:50:15] <AnthroMetal> roundabout? to be continued
[2:50:15] <%CptCreampuff16> nest to that tree u just went to
[2:50:19] <koffeemancer> its in the crevice next to erd tree
[2:50:44] <%CptCreampuff16> middle of lake
[2:51:05] <SubjectX07x> Yeah.
[2:51:12] <crackhead000111> Yuh
[2:51:24] <sirrice77> yeah debate parlor, dodge giant ball, take elevator
[2:51:25] <%king_wragles> Rennalia is just a tough fight if you aren't ready for it
[2:51:27] <%generalve> @peachsaliva  have oyh experienced crash's ? I'm at 14 now :(
[2:51:32] <%king_wragles> I'm pretty sure you have this
[2:51:34] <SubjectX07x> Thank GOD this isn't like DS3 where "Wuh oh that NPC's gone guess the quest is brokey." @PeachSaliva
[2:52:00] <%Agami23> there is a path to kill cannonball
[2:52:07] <%generalve> @peachsaliva were did you get that armor ?
[2:52:13] <%generalve> lol
[2:52:23] <SubjectX07x> Hell, even the ONE ending in this game that is a hard lock can be fixed if you go through the steps.
[2:52:24] <sirrice77> you can only screw up npc quests by either killing the npc or going too far into the story
[2:52:42] <crackhead000111> dont have to worry about broken quests if youre a degen like me a d slaughter every npc you come across without letting them speak 5Heae
[2:53:02] <SubjectX07x> Ah yes, the absolute monster playthrough.
[2:53:03] <SubjectX07x> A classic.
[2:53:20] <azure_dunes> if you go left before the rennala elevator there's a shortcut back to the grace that skips the ball btw
[2:53:27] <sirrice77> @generalve it's D's armor so he needs to die either by you killing him or from stuff happening
[2:53:30] <+YabbaTroll> @SveriSageAdvice oh damn since i never met him before I killed grafted guy he just shows up in the roundtable, I've been running past him to test my weapons this whole time lol
[2:53:33] <juan_wu_tamad> you got this paige, let;s go
[2:53:36] <+pectusumbra> wolves might be good
[2:53:39] <%generalve> @peachsaliva thanks for the chair recommendation by the way. I've had the embody for 3 days and my back is way more tolerable
[2:53:43] <tubit> I've had one quest break in this game
[2:53:52] <sirrice77> @tubit which one?
[2:53:53] <%CptCreampuff16> are your summons upgraded?
[2:53:53] <%SveriSageAdvice> @YabbaTroll hahah nice
[2:53:56] <heartlesshealer> oh yeah the puppets are here
[2:53:58] <oda_flobunaga> @PeachSaliva do you have the Blood Slash ash?
[2:54:02] <+Nekros4442> Marionnettes are pretty good
[2:54:04] <crackhead000111> im glad someone can respect the art @subjectx07x LUL
[2:54:11] <juan_wu_tamad> make sure u have enough FP to summon
[2:54:11] <+Dark_Ult> marionettes are really helpful
[2:54:14] <+pectusumbra> If she's someone with low poise then wolves might be able to chip her a lot
[2:54:15] <Therusher> I've had one quest break and one boss despawn permanently :(
[2:54:17] <+Fadedblank247> I used the demi human one for a long time
[2:54:22] <heartlesshealer> hmm
[2:54:43] <tanarath> jellyfish are great, everything else isn't as great
[2:54:45] <Sunstalker> @PeachSaliva Just like weapons, there's two tiers of summons, both use their own upgrade materials. Normal and legendary summons
[2:54:45] <+pectusumbra> it'd burn your bar but you can marios
[2:54:58] <SubjectX07x> Yeah, you'll benefit more from a summon you'll get far later down the line if you keep doing Rogier's stuff.
[2:55:06] <SubjectX07x> One that takes HP instead.
[2:55:07] <ThatChainmecha> there are sine ashes that use HP instead of FP
[2:55:09] <+FadingEmber> do you have any special summons?
[2:55:13] <ThatChainmecha> but i only found one so far
[2:55:29] <heartlesshealer> Jelly is a neat tank
[2:55:35] <+pectusumbra> I guess use puppets, drink your blue, then go in?
[2:55:35] <SubjectX07x> Well, I say rogier's but it's really rogier leading you into someone else.
[2:55:37] <tubit> @tubit the one where you're supposed to deliver a letter to a commander in a fortress
[2:55:43] <niffinbox> time to roll out
[2:56:05] <juan_wu_tamad> fight w ur heart paige
[2:56:05] <%hermitdab> summon may get stuck in fog door so be careful
[2:56:05] <SubjectX07x> Summon will be far more useful phase 2.
[2:56:06] <%SveriSageAdvice> i think i saw Pat try to use the summon before he went in and they broke?
[2:56:09] <%SveriSageAdvice> but im unsure
[2:56:10] <%king_wragles> You can summon before the last hit, and your summon comes with you
[2:56:11] <+FadingEmber> well as long as the jelly is reasonably leveled she will survive to the second phase
[2:56:13] <tanarath> use the summon right before you kill her in p1
[2:56:14] <+Nekros4442> oh you want to use it for the actual boss
[2:56:16] <+ccwettr123> 1st phase has very little damage, probably ok to summon at start
[2:56:18] <+Nekros4442> then just use wolves imo
[2:56:20] <+pectusumbra> oh yeah, right, I'm only thinking of phase 2
[2:56:23] <Rolandknight> @PeachSaliva use Oleg his tank power will make you through the whole fight
[2:56:27] <Beesnipe1> bedge time guys
[2:56:28] <SubjectX07x> Will it even bring the jelly into phase 2?
[2:56:45] <ThatChainmecha> what are these things anyway
[2:56:47] <sirrice77> yeah summons carry over
[2:56:52] <ThatChainmecha> her children? clones?
[2:57:01] <+polothegreatest> paige fighting bayo plaguePog
[2:57:01] <ThatChainmecha> or is that a spoiler?
[2:57:11] <sirrice77> spoiler but you can find out right after the boss
[2:57:17] <crackhead000111> no its heavily implied in the fight itself
[2:57:27] <SubjectX07x> @ThatChainmecha Honestly, no god damn clue.
[2:57:38] <ThatChainmecha> ah, I've been doing optional content, so i havent gotten this far in the main quest yet
[2:57:40] <SubjectX07x> They're her creepy baby clones.
[2:57:45] <SubjectX07x> Why not.
[2:57:50] <+ccwettr123> uh
[2:57:53] <+pectusumbra> Curious if that worked
[2:58:01] <+ccwettr123> ok, thought it crashed there for a sec
[2:58:08] <niffinbox> I dont think shes ready for this jelly
[2:58:10] <Beesnipe1> yeah shes a really cool fight
[2:58:10] <huskarl_zap> Cuck queen renela
[2:58:13] <+queaks> smol head
[2:58:17] <%hermitdab> makes me want bloodborne 2 that much more
[2:58:20] <%hermitdab> miss that fast combat
[2:58:23] <ThatChainmecha> damn a goddess stole her man
[2:58:27] <SubjectX07x> Also, remember the name of the one who comes in here... it's a surprise tool that will help us later.

[2:59:47] <MyNameIsRasus> DA MOON
[2:59:49] <Beesnipe1> pog full moon
[2:59:50] <huskarl_zap> is that different from when I played?
[2:59:50] <+vexion_smh> wow literally a moon
[2:59:55] <oda_flobunaga> MOON GANG
[2:59:56] <Beesnipe1> lol cya jelly fish
[2:59:57] <+pectusumbra> THat's no moon!
[3:00:01] <%SveriSageAdvice> damn, Jelly was annihilated
[3:00:01] <SulfurousAcid> throwing moons at you
[3:00:03] <SulfurousAcid> rude
[3:00:05] <ThatChainmecha> oh its like that sun spell i saw used in an evergaol
[3:00:06] <crackhead000111> jelly chan just got 1 tapped LUL
[3:00:10] <MyNameIsRasus> That's a spell station!
[3:00:12] <ThatChainmecha> except moon
[3:00:12] <SulfurousAcid> jelly did take an entire kamehameha
[3:00:22] <MyNameIsRasus> Got kamehameha'd
[3:00:25] <Bloomingzonda> Yeah wolves would probably be better harder to hit
[3:00:25] <+vexion_smh> hype beamed to death monkaS
[3:00:29] <heartlesshealer> the backstep on your technique helped a lot
[3:00:32] <%hermitdab> you can sprint away and roll but you gotta make sure to unlock
[3:00:32] <oda_flobunaga> If you have the Blood Slash Ash, it might help
[3:00:35] <+ccwettr123> if you can keep on her, you can interrupt all her spells
[3:00:36] <niffinbox> looks like she was ready for this jelly
[3:00:36] <gespenstkick> Peach using the sword's retreating slice to dodge wew
[3:00:36] <Beesnipe1> @ThatChainmecha yea you get it from the boss, their is also a dark moon version
[3:00:44] <SubjectX07x> Wolves will probably provide a better distract.
[3:00:45] <heartlesshealer> Your plan worked, but jelly was too slow to escape laser
[3:00:45] <crackhead000111> no. got kamehameeeeeeeeeeehaaaaaaaaaa'd
[3:00:50] <+Dark_Ult> Marionettes help stun
[3:00:51] <+FadingEmber> eh, the jelly did its job
[3:00:53] <oda_flobunaga> Ash of war
[3:00:54] <MyNameIsRasus> She really just said "imma fire my laser"
[3:01:00] <+FadingEmber> you just have to go in
[3:01:17] <tanarath> You can stop before killing her in p1, physic + summon, then kill her
[3:01:18] <SulfurousAcid> puppers kaiAww
[3:01:25] <SubjectX07x> Hmmm
[3:01:25] <+infeliciter> nice
[3:01:29] <%king_wragles> The marionettes will do more damage, but the wolves worked better for me
[3:01:31] <niffinbox> marionettes
[3:01:32] <+infeliciter> wolves
[3:01:32] <SubjectX07x> Hard to tell honestly,.
[3:01:39] <Khester824> Marionettes have machineguns
[3:01:47] <juan_wu_tamad> try whatever u like more
[3:01:49] <Beesnipe1> wolves, she is range herself
[3:01:51] <heartlesshealer> more wolves, might get harder for them to get taken out by the orb
[3:01:52] <SubjectX07x> Probably not.
[3:01:53] <Beesnipe1> yeah sheild re garbo
[3:01:55] <%king_wragles> Depends on the shield
[3:01:56] <SubjectX07x> It'll block very little.
[3:02:03] <%king_wragles> I don't think your's will be great to use on her
[3:02:04] <+FadingEmber> you take chip
[3:02:05] <+infeliciter> not with the dorito
[3:02:07] <+ccwettr123> unless your shield has REALLY high Magic resist
[3:02:08] <sirrice77> a magic blocking shield would work but i dont know if you have one
[3:02:18] <%hereiam407> bonk
[3:02:27] <Beesnipe1> block THIS
[3:02:30] <niffinbox> orb strikes again
[3:02:45] <+FadingEmber> Paige do you want to get rid of the boulder?
[3:02:46] <Sunstalker> I know a weapon art nearbye that capable of giving your shielf a magic parry
[3:02:48] <+infeliciter> the doritro is a good shield just not magic
[3:02:50] <sirrice77> no look at the numbers
[3:02:59] <sirrice77> They list the resistance of each element
[3:03:01] <%hereiam407> The power of blue ranch
[3:03:36] <+ccwettr123> not smart enough
[3:03:44] <Bloomingzonda> the tower shield and less armor

[3:04:03] <+leviting> probably better off just 2h+dodge: half a kamehameha still probably will mess you up
[3:04:11] <+ccwettr123> maybe take off shield and put on more armor?
[3:04:13] <%hereiam407> Promise you will never die

[3:09:00] <heartlesshealer> that a chest?
[3:09:06] <+pectusumbra> to your character's left
[3:09:13] <huskarl_zap> who said godrick is dead?
[3:09:15] <SubjectX07x> You need a special item to respec through her though.
[3:09:23] <SubjectX07x> It's a consumable item to respec.
[3:09:35] <+Infernal_Dalek> Are her proportions weird?
[3:09:36] <niffinbox> that looks like a big bread roll
[3:09:37] <+shootbang_exe> egg
[3:09:46] <SulfurousAcid> afeared
[3:09:47] <%nip_nips> @huskarl_zap the great rune cheevo is for restoring a rune, not getting one, if thats why you think godrick wasnt dead
[3:09:50] <heartlesshealer> she does stat rebirth and cosmetic rebirth
[3:09:55] <SubjectX07x> Lol it looks like she's holding a big chicky nuggy
[3:10:04] <huskarl_zap> her egg doesn't dry
[3:10:06] <ThatChainmecha> birth me mommy!
[3:10:09] <+vexion_smh> locked :(
[3:10:12] <+Rellim80> Breastfeed the Egg
[3:10:28] <%hereiam407> BB
[3:10:29] <%king_wragles> I'm back, did she do it?
[3:10:33] <%nip_nips> she did
[3:10:35] <signofzeta> she did
[3:10:36] <$shurtal> Egg is Second Place Orb
[3:10:37] <%king_wragles> HELL YA YOU BEAT HER ASS
[3:10:37] <Bloomingzonda> If you aint put your titty in an egg you aint living
[3:10:37] <tanarath> yes
[3:10:38] <ThatChainmecha> yes
[3:10:49] <oda_flobunaga> Magic
[3:10:52] <ThatChainmecha> could i offer you an egg in these trying times?
[3:10:53] <+Nekros4442> you didnt fight her in phase 2
[3:10:55] <ohno58> rebirth
[3:10:55] <%king_wragles> @PeachSaliva you fought her dream, it's weird
[3:10:58] <niffinbox> I always put my titty on my morning eggs
[3:11:02] <huskarl_zap> but can godrick die?
[3:11:04] <+ccwettr123> also, her rune is already awakened, so no need to do anything.  But you cant equip it either
[3:11:04] <+Nekros4442> You saw Ranni conjure an image of her for phase 2
[3:11:05] <signofzeta> it was a memory
[3:11:05] <%Puhff> she's not a demigod
[3:11:10] <%Puhff> just a badass lady
[3:11:12] <ThatChainmecha> i dont think Margit died either
[3:11:12] <heartlesshealer> you fought the idea of her
[3:11:18] <+infeliciter> did you beat godrick?
[3:11:19] <SulfurousAcid> she's just super smart
[3:11:19] <ThatChainmecha> he said he was coming back
[3:11:25] <%Puhff> her husband Radagon left her and she went insane
[3:11:25] <ExpressNode> What?
[3:11:25] <%king_wragles> And now with her egg being blank, you can use it to respec
[3:11:26] <Bloomingzonda> Yeah Margit talked after he was dead
[3:11:27] <+ViktorTalonRoe> If Paige has a baby it'll be the strongest. With being breastfed and being guarded by Spiderman nobody could defeat them.
[3:11:28] <SubjectX07x> @Nekros4442 She doesn't know who Ranni is quite yet, hasn't been through Carian.
[3:11:32] <%hereiam407> That's messed up
[3:11:33] <huskarl_zap> can they die with out the rune of death?
[3:11:37] <ExpressNode> This sounds like some kingdom hearts shit
[3:11:40] <%king_wragles> @PeachSaliva remember how you had to decide between some talismans? Go back and talk to finger lady again
[3:11:40] <+shootbang_exe> I'm waiting for vaati to explain
[3:11:49] <+ViktorTalonRoe> *breastfed as an egg
[3:11:52] <ThatChainmecha> she's seen Ranni if she can summon ashes though
[3:11:57] <+extantCadence> You were fighting the manifestation of her made by the unborn amber egg or something
[3:12:01] <SubjectX07x> @ThatChainmecha By another name...
[3:12:06] <Bloomingzonda> Mind would let you do your special move more
[3:12:06] <niffinbox> vaati's bedtime stories will tell all
[3:12:16] <%nip_nips> @ThatChainmecha that was "ranna"
[3:12:19] <crackhead000111> shes Rannis mothe4
[3:12:22] <oda_flobunaga> You mean Renna, *wink*
[3:12:23] <+Axellogic> I used that halberd for a long time
[3:12:25] <ThatChainmecha> okay now im confused
[3:12:26] <Bloomingzonda> No its worse in every way
[3:12:37] <ThatChainmecha> too many R name characters
[3:12:39] <SubjectX07x> @ThatChainmecha She introduces herself as Renna at the church.
[3:12:42] <sirrice77> halberds are good but like bloodhound blade is way stronger that most weapons
[3:12:43] <%nip_nips> the names are stupid confusing
[3:13:02] <ThatChainmecha> i also keep mixing up the names Godrick and Godwyn
[3:13:05] <huskarl_zap> Rahdon
[3:13:08] <+ccwettr123> welcome to George RR Martin world
[3:13:08] <Jetsfantasy> Probably GRRM because it never was a problem before
[3:13:18] <niffinbox> George r. r. r. r. r. r. r. martin
[3:13:20] <SubjectX07x> Rahdan, Radagon, Rykard
[3:13:34] <oda_flobunaga> How many Gwyns were there again?
[3:13:36] <$shurtal> i'm currently pumping endurance so i can wear pants while powerstancing colossal greatswords
[3:13:40] <+ccwettr123> at least they didnt go the Anglo-Saxon route or we'd have at least 16 Aethelfreds
[3:13:48] <ThatChainmecha> I dont look forward to fighting Rykard
[3:13:49] <+extantCadence> The Gwyn names were more distinct imo
[3:13:50] <+leviting> the names are as bad as they've always been
[3:14:00] <%nip_nips> @shurtal dual colossal swords is STUPID damage
[3:14:07] <huskarl_zap> Ranala, Ranni, Renna, Ranna, Radagon, Rahdon
[3:14:17] <%hereiam407> Mary has been consortin with devil at night
[3:14:20] <Bloomingzonda> I think part of it is this games has more npcs than normal
[3:14:21] <$shurtal> @nip_nips gotta hit bosses the minimum amount of times
[3:14:32] <%nip_nips> ive been doing cleanup and killing some dungeon bosses in 2 hits
[3:14:50] <ThatChainmecha> they can use more consanants, use a Z or V in name
[3:14:50] <crackhead000111> and here we thought george r was just a marketing tactic. turns out, they just needed him to make shit confusing
[3:14:54] <Bloomingzonda> fingers
[3:15:07] <ThatChainmecha> yeah
[3:15:08] <SubjectX07x> Remember there was still those catacombs up there.
[3:15:10] <+Grayhammatter> sure
[3:15:13] <heartlesshealer> sure
[3:15:14] <ThatChainmecha> theres some scary stuff there
[3:15:15] <signofzeta> ya, let's do it
[3:15:27] <+shootbang_exe> did you do the mansion?
[3:15:28] <juan_wu_tamad> splorin time
[3:15:36] <Bloomingzonda> You just got a boss soul paige
[3:15:43] <SubjectX07x> @shootbang_exe She'll end up doing the mansion anyway after catacombs.
[3:15:43] <%king_wragles> 100%
[3:15:45] <ThatChainmecha> mansion first
[3:15:47] <+ccwettr123> or awaken Godrick's rune
[3:15:47] <+Grayhammatter> yep
[3:15:53] <%king_wragles> That mansion has hands tho
[3:15:57] <niffinbox> look at what moon mommy dropped
[3:15:59] <ThatChainmecha> really cool sidequest ther
[3:16:00] <+pectusumbra> oh yeah, you might want to look at moon rememberance whatever
[3:16:04] <crackhead000111> YEP
[3:16:08] <SulfurousAcid> wow what a mansion
[3:16:12] <%nip_nips> @king_wragles thats good, it'll give her a hand
[3:16:12] <+shootbang_exe> how's rogier doing?
[3:16:14] <oda_flobunaga> The mansion, hands down...
[3:16:15] <heartlesshealer> oh yeah the remembrance and the unborn rune
[3:16:22] <SubjectX07x> @ThatChainmecha If she does the catacombs Rogier will point her in that direction anyway.
[3:16:30] <ThatChainmecha> check if Rogier is asleep
[3:16:34] <%king_wragles> Can the Fingers stop shuddering? Thanks
[3:16:48] <Bloomingzonda> The fingers have assumed DIDDLE MODE
[3:16:49] <%hereiam407> That's some Silent HIll shit
[3:16:50] <$shurtal> Try fingers, But Hole
[3:16:56] <+ccwettr123> I hate how the fingers have ahir
[3:16:59] <+ccwettr123> *hair
[3:16:59] <%nip_nips> if only i had a giant, but hole
[3:17:07] <+shootbang_exe> gonna sound weird but if rogier is asleep I'd say do the mansion
[3:17:13] <%king_wragles> You can now have up to 3 talismans
[3:17:24] <ThatChainmecha> i found a magic that implied, there was a three fingers
[3:17:25] <crackhead000111> fingers therefore rump
[3:17:28] <SGrim> Only need two
[3:17:32] <ThatChainmecha> yeah
[3:17:42] <ThatChainmecha> they told me to go to the capital after this
[3:17:44] <sirrice77> You need two to get into the capital and from there you don't need any more
[3:17:47] <tanarath> yes, but there's tons more
[3:17:58] <%nip_nips> like 90% of the game is optional
[3:17:59] <SubjectX07x> 4 total
[3:18:05] <%king_wragles> I hope 5, there are some really cool one
[3:18:07] <%king_wragles> ah dang
[3:18:10] <oda_flobunaga> 80% of the game is totally optional/hidden
[3:18:15] <+leviting> I imagine you might be underleveled though?
[3:18:15] <SGrim> @PeachSaliva telling you the reasoning behind just two would be a minor spoiler.
[3:18:16] <Bloomingzonda> Yeah the speedruns are already down to like 2 hours
[3:18:21] <ThatChainmecha> because Radahn and Malenia are hard
[3:18:31] <heartlesshealer> don't forget your moon stuff
[3:18:31] <SubjectX07x> It's kinda hilarious how much of this game is outright optional content.
[3:18:36] <%nip_nips> i beat malenia, that was suffering
[3:18:41] <ThatChainmecha> if all great runes were needed no one would beat this game
[3:18:42] <heartlesshealer> and that great unborn rune
[3:18:47] <SubjectX07x> THREE of the major overworld areas are entirely optional.
[3:18:48] <huskarl_zap> D's ball bearings
[3:18:58] <signofzeta> i beat a boss that apparently only 0.5% of pc players have beaten, VERY hidden
[3:19:08] <ThatChainmecha> where is it sign?
[3:19:11] <%nip_nips> is it the one in ternado land?
[3:19:19] <ThatChainmecha> if its after the capital i cant find it yet
[3:19:27] <oda_flobunaga> I just finished all of the capital today, oy vey.  It's legit too big.
[3:19:32] <SubjectX07x> @signofzeta I've got one that only .2% have beaten. LUL
[3:19:49] <crackhead000111> but as souls fans, literally nothing is optional, we must uncover every square inch
[3:19:49] <signofzeta> @SubjectX07x damn, gotta search for that one i guess!
[3:20:03] <SubjectX07x> It's in Farum Azula if you know where that is.
[3:20:04] <ThatChainmecha> Marika is stealing husbands
[3:20:17] <+RedMaskBandit> I made the mistake of fighting Radahn in the morning and now I've been combing through the areas I didn't fully explore
[3:20:23] <signofzeta> @SubjectX07x nah, haven't gotten there yet
[3:20:38] <ThatChainmecha> THREE HUSBANDS?
[3:20:39] <%nip_nips> yeah i know the boss you're talking about
[3:20:39] <SubjectX07x> Understandable, it's VERY late.
[3:20:53] <oda_flobunaga> Dat Ass
[3:20:55] <ExpressNode> 70 int! holy shit
[3:21:01] <%Puhff> scepter
[3:21:06] <SubjectX07x> 70 int spell, it's not very good lol.
[3:21:06] <ThatChainmecha> wtf
[3:21:07] <+pectusumbra> I mean 60 and 70 is WILD
[3:21:10] <+leviting> damn, just chuck the moon at them
[3:21:13] <crackhead000111> wut
[3:21:14] <+ccwettr123> gotta be big brained for those
[3:21:17] <%nip_nips> who need smorts when BIG AND STRONG
[3:21:21] <ThatChainmecha> I'll stick with my Vergil Sword
[3:21:21] <Jetsfantasy> I still can't believe we're taking orders from giant fingers
[3:21:22] <niffinbox> scepter looks pretty
[3:21:28] <tanarath> souls
[3:21:28] <SubjectX07x> It's main benefit is it weakens magic resist, but it takes like 10 whole ass seconds to cast.
[3:21:37] <crackhead000111> nom it
[3:21:39] <ExpressNode> Consume
[3:21:39] <+eanscrale> The scepter is pretty good but you need that INT for it to matter
[3:21:39] <sirrice77> scepter i guess but only if you'll respec into int
[3:21:40] <heartlesshealer> either save it for scepter or eat that moon
[3:21:42] <SubjectX07x> NEVER
[3:21:42] <+ccwettr123> scepter is cool, moon is bad unless the enemy is like, asleep
[3:21:43] <frankavich> You dont want to throw a moon at someone?
[3:21:46] <SubjectX07x> Consume.
[3:21:49] <+Nekros4442> consume
[3:21:51] <+pectusumbra> I mean if you have good enough summons
[3:21:56] <%Sotetsu> Keep just in case
[3:21:56] <+spacepiratezod> But what about the ACHIEVEMENTS
[3:21:57] <oda_flobunaga> suncume
[3:21:58] <tanarath> Never ever, you never have the time
[3:22:00] <SubjectX07x> Yep.
[3:22:02] <Jetsfantasy> I consumed it for the 20k
[3:22:04] <niffinbox> throw moon
[3:22:06] <+RedMaskBandit> both
[3:22:07] <oda_flobunaga> yarp
[3:22:08] <+FadingEmber> save for later you might respec
[3:22:08] <SubjectX07x> Can dupe.
[3:22:10] <heartlesshealer> you can dupe it later yes
[3:22:11] <%Sotetsu> 20k is nothing
[3:22:11] <niffinbox> ye you can
[3:22:19] <+eanscrale> wow really? that's nice
[3:22:24] <%nip_nips> @spacepiratezod those arent related to any achievements
[3:22:26] <%bevyrage> you can duplicate it without needing it in your inventory btw
[3:22:32] <Bloomingzonda> One of the best scorcery items for scaling is actually like 1000 runes from the guy by the swamp
[3:22:33] <SubjectX07x> Yeah probably.
[3:22:33] <Ell1ot> idk.
[3:22:35] <ThatChainmecha> souls are also easy to grind
[3:22:35] <heartlesshealer> yeah, it doesn't need to still in your bag to duplicate
[3:22:38] <ExpressNode> Become kirby full mouth mode on that soul
[3:22:42] <ThatChainmecha> so its up to you
[3:22:47] <%Sotetsu> I think duplication is limited, though
[3:22:47] <SubjectX07x> I mean, do you even expect to be respeccing into THAT MUCH int?
[3:22:51] <+pectusumbra> I mean I'd say just eat it when you need it
[3:22:53] <+spacepiratezod> @nip_nips Collect all Legendary Incants/ Sorceries?
[3:23:02] <%nip_nips> thats not one of the legendary ones
[3:23:04] <SubjectX07x> Rare item, but they are farmable.
[3:23:06] <ThatChainmecha> i have 7
[3:23:09] <tanarath> Rare drops
[3:23:10] <+pectusumbra> Rare but farmable later
[3:23:11] <SubjectX07x> Promise.
[3:23:12] <ThatChainmecha> i dont know how
[3:23:17] <tanarath> you won't
[3:23:19] <niffinbox> you wont
[3:23:20] <heartlesshealer> eat the moon
[3:23:25] <tanarath> no
[3:23:28] <Hydrapissed> its moon spell and some staff right?
[3:23:30] <niffinbox> eat moon cheese
[3:23:30] <Hydrapissed> who cares lol
[3:23:31] <SubjectX07x> Yeah no you can get em at a mausoleum even if you eat.

[3:23:44] <Jetsfantasy> I mean are you going 70 INT anytime on this char?
[3:23:45] <ThatChainmecha> check Rogier
[3:23:51] <%nip_nips> @spacepiratezod look up the list of the ones required for that, its way fewer than you'd think
[3:23:59] <signofzeta> wait, you can sit at the table?!
[3:24:03] <%CptCreampuff16> equip great rune?
[3:24:06] <ThatChainmecha> i realized i killed two great rune user before he fell asleep
[3:24:06] <+RedMaskBandit> yeah i just duped Godricks without it.
[3:24:19] <+RedMaskBandit> larval tears can be found or bought
[3:24:23] <signofzeta> good lord i never even checked to see if you could

[3:45:46] <+andrew_the_junkrat> First time catching a stream and you went the wrong way. You haven't changed a bit.
[3:45:52] <AdmiralButtloaf> is horse not available here?
[3:45:54] <+MattyNezz> I don't think you have the stats for the reward, but it's still neat
[3:45:59] <ThatChainmecha> i had no idea this path was here
[3:46:07] <ThatChainmecha> cant use horse in minidungeons
[3:46:08] <+coward_man> @MelBrooksKA good thing she's got the bloodhound sword then LUL
[3:46:17] <%nip_nips> consistently inconsistent
[3:46:25] <ThatChainmecha> OOOOOOOOOOOH
[3:46:26] <+vexion_smh> YOOOO
[3:46:27] <Jack_O_Valentino> OP sword get!
[3:46:28] <NaberiustheNefarious> this game is 90% getting lost for the moment

[3:46:32] <ThatChainmecha> shit the PVP weapon
[3:46:33] <+andrew_the_junkrat> vineTalianDX vineTalianDX
[3:46:33] <+Gregmeyer> most broken weapon in the game
[3:46:34] <+vexion_smh> *one
[3:46:36] <ThatChainmecha> im coming back here
[3:46:36] <@MelBrooksKA> That's a rad name
[3:46:38] <+leviting> the busted one
[3:46:39] <+kewlmyc> BEST SWORD INTHE GAME
[3:46:39] <+Nekros4442> Thats legit one of the best weapons in the game
[3:46:41] <captainm4d> STRONGEST OF BLADES
[3:46:42] <+MattyNezz> Most busted sword in Early/Mid game
[3:46:43] <+pectusumbra> apparently the best sword in the game at least righ tnow
[3:46:43] <%SuckerPunchSyd> YEYEYEYEYE
[3:46:43] <tanarath> bs op sword get
[3:46:47] <+Nekros4442> You could use that weapon for the rest o the game
[3:46:48] <cheapdoc> I feel like I could play this game forever
[3:46:51] <ThatChainmecha> wtf i dont have that faith
[3:46:52] <%imthewisejanitor> Fuckin' siiick.
[3:46:53] <%Ranryu692> oh that looks awesome
[3:46:56] <+pectusumbra> int AND faith
[3:46:57] <ThatChainmecha> what type of build is that
[3:47:00] <Therusher> This is the cheese weapon from the ymfah vid
[3:47:00] <ThatChainmecha> wtf
[3:47:06] <+vexion_smh> Absolutely god killer sword
[3:47:07] <gespenstkick> Hardly the best sword, but very good yes
[3:47:14] <crackhead000111> just equip it and look at the detail on it
[3:47:18] <+MattyNezz> Wall of Flame and LAZER BEAM
[3:47:21] <%rumtumtugnutz> Thats a Game of Thriongs
[3:47:24] <ThatChainmecha> first time as DEX/INT that i feel like I made a mistake
[3:47:32] <+kewlmyc> you do a Kamehameha as one of the skills
[3:47:34] <%zamatermort> Best sword, as always, is claymore
[3:47:35] <tanarath> @thatchainmecha caster
[3:47:40] <cheapdoc> I expected it to be bigger
[3:47:44] <ThatChainmecha> magic is rad bro
[3:47:51] <+FadingEmber> not smart enough
[3:48:01] <%imthewisejanitor> Big smart needed.
[3:48:03] <+pectusumbra> it's a wild sword for sure
[3:48:03] <crackhead000111> @cheapdoc never heard that before
[3:48:11] <+shootbang_exe> shortcut to entrance
[3:48:18] <+MattyNezz> Only downside is the busted stat requirements that suck for everything but literally itself
[3:48:21] <+kewlmyc> I'm not faithful enough to use it either.
[3:48:26] <+FadingEmber> I feel like mages get almost too many options in this game LUL
[3:48:42] <ThatChainmecha> not really
[3:48:43] <+andrew_the_junkrat> Love your gargoyle helmet
[3:48:50] <ThatChainmecha> most of the magic Ive gotten sucks
[3:48:57] <+MattyNezz> Mages have limited options, but everything they do get is amazing
[3:49:04] <ThatChainmecha> except for a few glintstone and gravity attacks
[3:49:15] <Ell1ot> it's a gargoyle? i've been calling it the goblin hat
[3:49:15] <+FadingEmber> I am just tried of seeing weapons I can't use lol
[3:49:16] <ThatChainmecha> i feel like Incantations are really busted though
[3:49:24] <+vexion_smh> I do love my flashy attacks LUL
[3:49:27] <$drabberfaun535> what did it drop from?
[3:49:34] <+MattyNezz> Magic spells kind of sucks until 2/3rds of the way through the game, then it starts getting rad
[3:49:35] <SubjectX07x> Some sorceries suck, some are god tier.
[3:49:39] <SubjectX07x> Go figure.
[3:49:46] <crackhead000111> im a dex/int power stancer and i absolutely love it. the hell you mean it was a mistake
[3:50:01] <ThatChainmecha> i feel like there no good midgame sorceries
[3:50:15] <+notsoy> didn't know there was a zangief helmet
[3:50:16] <tanarath> @thatchainmecha correct
[3:50:22] <SubjectX07x> Hmm.. I don't believe any drops are required.
[3:50:30] <+MattyNezz> Bow and Greatsword sorceries are good
[3:50:35] <ThatChainmecha> its like 15-25 INT sorceries and then a jump to 50-70 INT
[3:50:44] <ThatChainmecha> nothing useful in between
[3:51:19] <azure_dunes> idk what you mean, there's a good couple of int skills in the 30-40 range
[3:51:19] <ThatChainmecha> super wolf
[3:51:28] <+Grayhammatter> sneaky beaky
[3:51:49] <SubjectX07x> Not friend.
[3:51:50] <ThatChainmecha> its not
[3:51:55] <+Grayhammatter> not a friend
[3:51:55] <ThatChainmecha> theres tons of them here
[3:51:58] <+SpareKeese> Oh thank god
[3:52:02] <%imthewisejanitor> It sure ain't now.
[3:52:05] <AngryPumpkin1995> I legitimately love that you can't lock onto friendlies
[3:52:08] <+MattyNezz> Sorry, but you need that wolf to get the good ending
[3:52:10] <bassoontyphoon> Dog!
[3:52:23] <XzileGaming> good ending wolf
[3:52:25] <ThatChainmecha> Elden Wolf O Elden Wolf
[3:52:26] <+Fetrigon> it was paige. you just got the worst ending creepy49Porporu creepy49Porporu creepy49Porporu
[3:52:29] <Ell1ot> can you pet the dog?
[3:52:45] <+vexion_smh> LUL
[3:52:51] <ThatChainmecha> i mean you are in someone's house
[3:52:54] <SubjectX07x> Yeah sorry that wolf was actually the reincarnation of the main god of the game, bad ending achieved. Kappa
[3:52:56] <+vexion_smh> aww puppy
[3:52:59] <crackhead000111> holy fuck that stamina pool. you might as well be playing sekiro
[3:53:00] <ThatChainmecha> they probably want you to leave
[3:53:34] <ThatChainmecha> that guy drops a STR/INT weapon
[3:53:35] <SubjectX07x> A beefed up troll bro.
[3:53:38] <azure_dunes> le
[3:53:47] <azure_dunes> I legit ran past these guys
[3:53:51] <+coward_man> why would they want you to leave after giving such a hand on your way in
[3:53:53] <+Stormzcales_Lair> Wait is she an argonian
[3:54:00] <SubjectX07x> It's a pretty fancy sword tbh.
[3:54:01] <Bloomingzonda> The big difference with incantations and sorceries is that sorceries scale. An incatation does the same amount of damage no matter what. Sorceries scale with int and with you staff that can be upgraded to scale better
[3:54:06] <%blaccbird914> I cheesed him with posion through a door
[3:54:11] <SubjectX07x> But if we're looking for strength int, we can do better.
[3:54:21] <SubjectX07x> We can aim... for the moon.
[3:54:29] <ThatChainmecha> true

[3:55:33] <ThatChainmecha> bloodborne enemies

[3:55:38] <AdmiralButtloaf> Sneak King
[3:55:46] <SubjectX07x> I'd say.. maybe like one of those fire ankled giant dudes but without the weak point?
[3:55:49] <+soloshotfirst82> Oh god - you killed the dude's dogs, and now slayed his Burger Kings.  He's having a really bad day.
[3:56:33] <tanarath> :)
[3:56:36] <SubjectX07x> Wouldn't do this right now.

[4:07:30] <ThatChainmecha> maybe it depends on level?
[4:07:34] <+MattyNezz> There are three towers in the little area, that one is unlocked later
[4:07:41] <SubjectX07x> But in all reality this area is for a questline you don't quite have yet.

[4:09:22] <rudiciuscaesar> I thought dog in English was poochie?
[4:09:36] <SubjectX07x> Not a giant... worse.
[4:09:36] <%nip_nips> SO BLIND
[4:09:41] <greasypete00> kill bug
[4:09:42] <+badhaye> ...
[4:09:44] <heartlesshealer> bye beetle
[4:09:44] <%Fuggins4U> rock the dragon
[4:09:44] <SubjectX07x> Dwagon
[4:09:51] <rudiciuscaesar> WHIFF
[4:09:58] <ThatChainmecha> ice weapons
[4:10:03] <heartlesshealer> hello chilling mist
[4:10:14] <+badhaye> run past to just go to the tower
[4:10:14] <rudiciuscaesar> Paige, no dragon can threaten you
[4:10:17] <greasypete00> i dont know if you could rock this dragon right now
[4:10:24] <krin_x> those bugs give more than flask charges?
[4:10:26] <ThatChainmecha> i havent killed a single dragon that isnt a magma wyrm yet
[4:10:30] <rudiciuscaesar> nah fuck him up
[4:10:30] <SubjectX07x> She can, he's tough but not invincible.
[4:10:34] <SubjectX07x> I believe.
[4:10:34] <%nip_nips> give the dragon a taste of the ol fingers
[4:10:35] <%rumtumtugnutz> Dog in fronch is honh honh baguette
[4:10:37] <greasypete00> you can go past it tho
[4:10:39] <+za7az> @krin_x No, only up to your maximum
[4:10:50] <+badhaye> the tower you want is behind the dragon
[4:11:12] <rudiciuscaesar> I would sneak, Torrent may blow more than just your cover here
[4:11:14] <+MattyNezz> You can just ride past him if you don't waste timer
[4:11:17] <%nip_nips> @krin_x the white bugs give loot, red and blue give flask refills
[4:11:21] <ThatChainmecha> wow
[4:11:30] <ThatChainmecha> I wonder why they let me in
[4:11:31] <krin_x> oh nice
[4:11:41] <ThatChainmecha> I actually dont know what unlocks this
[4:11:41] <+za7az> Why not simply convince the dragon that you are a friend? Kappa
[4:11:43] <%nip_nips> only the one rise is open until you start the quest
[4:11:57] <rudiciuscaesar> if anyone's gonna befriend a dragon, it would be Paige.
[4:12:11] <ThatChainmecha> Rannis is closed @nip_nips
[4:12:17] <%nip_nips> that was rennas
[4:12:22] <ThatChainmecha> or renna
[4:12:26] <ThatChainmecha> too many r names
[4:12:26] <%nip_nips> its supposed to be closed
[4:12:31] <ThatChainmecha> no its not
[4:12:37] <ThatChainmecha> it was open when i came here
[4:12:42] <%nip_nips> rannis is the first one
[4:12:44] <ThatChainmecha> and i only killed godrick
[4:13:23] <+MattyNezz> You need to do the quest in Rennas to unlock Rannis
[4:13:39] <TrashManRising> you can take that dragon, bro. I believe in you.
[4:13:39] <%nip_nips> other way around
[4:13:59] <%nip_nips> ranni gives the quest that eventually opens rennas
[4:14:23] <Pylohn> horse up and cut his hinny
[4:14:24] <+za7az> Take it out on a date, maybe you'll have better odds if you don't fight it
[4:14:27] <Therusher> That's the dragon that perma-despawned for me :(
[4:14:28] <ThatChainmecha> oh yeah
[4:14:32] <ThatChainmecha> too many r names
[4:14:38] <ThatChainmecha> i swear to god
[4:14:42] <%zamatermort> You can take the dragon, they are way less tough than you think
[4:14:52] <+tumzfestival> oh Paige
[4:15:33] <ThatChainmecha> up
[4:15:37] <+tumzfestival> You got dis
[4:15:46] <+MattyNezz> Puzzle solved
[4:15:59] <ThatChainmecha> time for lots of side content
[4:16:01] <%nip_nips> this quest is quite involved too
[4:16:22] <yukichocomilk> waifu ahead, therefore waifu ahead
[4:16:26] <bassoontyphoon> You solved the elevator puzzle! Good job!
[4:16:29] <+vexion_smh> OH HEY
[4:16:37] <%TrashManRising> Renna is awesome
[4:16:50] <%BinaryFireball> oh yoouuu know
[4:16:54] <%BinaryFireball> just stoppin by
[4:16:56] <+storebrandcandy> just hangin' out
[4:16:59] <+badhaye> just finished this quest this morning. it's a doozy
[4:17:00] <%BinaryFireball> was in teh neighborhood
[4:17:03] <%Fuggins4U> i like her hat
[4:17:06] <SubjectX07x> Oooooooh.
[4:17:11] <SubjectX07x> Okay, interesting.
[4:17:13] <ThatChainmecha> it was her
[4:17:14] <%nip_nips> shes awesome
[4:17:15] <Charronia> "Then what art thou doing in my house"
[4:17:16] <+za7az> That's hot
[4:17:22] <yukichocomilk> Kreygasm hell yeah
[4:17:28] <+Nekros4442> Thats hot
[4:17:28] <+tumzfestival> That's rad.
[4:17:29] <ThatChainmecha> remember this war started when someone stole the death rune
[4:17:31] <SubjectX07x> So if you meet her OUTSIDE of rogiers questline she's both less of a bitch to you and starts her quest line.
[4:17:39] <+vexion_smh> She's cool
[4:17:51] <+tumzfestival> Oh no
[4:17:55] <ThatChainmecha> wait rogier tells you about her?
[4:17:56] <+MattyNezz> Her squad is rad
[4:18:03] <azure_dunes> BLAIDD IS THE BEST
[4:18:04] <tanarath> ooooo
[4:18:05] <yukichocomilk> rogier has a questline? LUL
[4:18:11] <ThatChainmecha> he was just sick in my playthrough
[4:18:16] <%nip_nips> rogiers quest is to sit around, be stinky, then die
[4:18:16] <tanarath> Eternal city, sounds neat.
[4:18:26] <+shootbang_exe> congrats you are now officially doing one of (in my opinion) the coolest quests in the game
[4:18:26] <+tumzfestival> wall canceller
[4:18:27] <SubjectX07x> @yukichocomilk His quest line is basically a combining of Fia and Ranni's.
[4:18:40] <+MattyNezz> "Peculiarities", she says
[4:18:53] <ThatChainmecha> welcome to the Cool Crew
[4:19:07] <SubjectX07x> Also @PeachSaliva If you recall, Ranni was the one who took over Rennala in her second phase.
[4:19:12] <ThatChainmecha> we got a Doll, a Furry, a Giant, and a Nerd
[4:19:30] <SubjectX07x> Renna is Ranni.
[4:19:35] <+Nekros4442> Renna is Rannj
[4:19:38] <tanarath> Yeah, the names...
[4:19:42] <%Puhff> renna and ranni are the same person
[4:19:45] <SubjectX07x> Renna is Ranni, she just lied about her name.
[4:19:50] <+za7az> Sounds like a regular DnD campaign to me
[4:19:51] <+extantCadence> Ranni introduced herself as Renna the first time you met
[4:19:54] <Jack_O_Valentino> You can get Blaidd's mask somewhere here too
[4:19:55] <+pectusumbra> Ranni's the witch. She just said her name was Ranna as a big lie
[4:20:13] <SubjectX07x> Yeh.
[4:20:16] <SubjectX07x> Daughter.
[4:20:17] <ThatChainmecha> huh
[4:20:22] <SubjectX07x> Not the egg baby, just her daughter.
[4:20:23] <%Puhff> just regular
[4:20:25] <%Puhff> daughter
[4:20:26] <+za7az> Probably because you tried to kill her mother
[4:20:27] <+pectusumbra> you were fucking with her crazy mom
[4:20:27] <+Nekros4442> Cus you were about to kill her mom
[4:20:28] <sirrice77> because you were bullying her mum
[4:20:29] <SubjectX07x> Dunno what the eggs deal is.
[4:20:32] <ThatChainmecha> so i did this questline before going to the academy
[4:20:32] <%Puhff> cuz you were fucking with her mom lol
[4:20:35] <yukichocomilk> isn't renna the raya lucaria lady?
[4:20:38] <+MattyNezz> Some people think it was just a projection, an autopilot security system sort of deal
[4:20:48] <ThatChainmecha> so if i fight the boss, will i not have a phase 2 for rennala
[4:20:50] <ThatChainmecha> ?
[4:20:55] <ThatChainmecha> actual question
[4:20:56] <+MattyNezz> There's lots of... splitting going on with some characters
[4:21:01] <+Fadedblank247> isn't the egg her great rune
[4:21:09] <azure_dunes> all the cool people simp for ranni
[4:21:11] <bassoontyphoon> I mean if someone was trying to kill my mommy bayonetta I’d probably fight back too
[4:21:15] <+deathwatch308> psaCrazyhead
[4:21:25] <+tumzfestival> Beta Ray Bill?
[4:21:33] <Hydrapissed> course the WOLF would like the moon girl
[4:21:33] <ThatChainmecha> his voice doesnt fit
[4:21:37] <+pectusumbra> He's wolf-Guts. They made him just the right amount of sexy
[4:21:44] <+RedMaskBandit> u beat the shit out of them
[4:21:44] <greasypete00> hes just radiating friendly energy
[4:21:48] <Hydrapissed> 🌔 🐺
[4:21:52] <+MattyNezz> It's where Patches telported you
[4:22:01] <%imthewisejanitor> I've came upon a few wells in my day.
[4:22:04] <+CTMathiu> I love him
[4:22:05] <greasypete00> his voice is pretty much perfect for him i think
[4:22:06] <ThatChainmecha> where the bears are
[4:22:11] <Hydrapissed> mistwood to the east of it
[4:22:12] <ThatChainmecha> near the big tree in limgrave
[4:22:13] <+MattyNezz> Near the minor Erdtree in the woods
[4:22:15] <azure_dunes> siofra river well specifically
[4:22:19] <+dmbender> Blaidd feels like a Robb Stark reference too
[4:22:21] <Hydrapissed> oh this dick head ...
[4:22:23] <+MattyNezz> This duuuude
[4:22:23] <ThatChainmecha> its the nerd man
[4:22:24] <Bloomingzonda> @PeachSaliva you know what they say. where there is a well there is a way
[4:22:24] <koffeemancer> I think if you climb around the outside of this tower you find a mask that makes look like Blaidd
[4:22:26] <yukichocomilk> f this guy
[4:22:28] <Hydrapissed> course the BIG HAT is a dick head
[4:22:39] <ThatChainmecha> i plan on taking his hat
[4:22:40] <+tumzfestival> Sick hat bruh
[4:22:40] <bassoontyphoon> @dmbender wow how did I not catch that
[4:22:45] <tanarath> This guy sounds like Plague
[4:22:47] <ThatChainmecha> if you catch my meaning
[4:22:48] <Hydrapissed> hes fight was annoying to lol
[4:22:50] <%TrashManRising> that guy has a real stab me face
[4:22:55] <%VideoGoblin> Fun Fact: Blaidd is Welsh for Wolf, which is why "dd" is pronounced like "th".
[4:22:58] <%rumtumtugnutz> PROVINCIAL?!
[4:22:58] <%imthewisejanitor> I bet if you look away, and then look back, his hat gets bigger.
[4:23:06] <NDenizen> All these welshies makes me proud
[4:23:06] <+dearghostss> he's such a dick sorcerer, i love it
[4:23:10] <+tumzfestival> ME AND MY HAT
[4:23:12] <Bloomingzonda> @dmbender Also Diallos is just Jon Snow

[4:23:34] <ThatChainmecha> you cant
[4:23:42] <ThatChainmecha> Ranni has you stuck here
[4:23:42] <+shootbang_exe> I think you need to talk to ranni again

[4:24:52] <%rumtumtugnutz> Peepee soked heck hole

[4:25:02] <Hydrapissed> and likes the moon
[4:25:04] <ThatChainmecha> was stuck for 10 minutes
[4:25:05] <+MattyNezz> You can see her "ghost" piloting her
[4:25:08] <+dmbender> have you noticed her two faces?
[4:25:17] <Hydrapissed> yah on the left lol
[4:25:27] <+pectusumbra> oh yeah!

[4:25:38] <+tumzfestival> Unspoken twin
[4:25:40] <SubjectX07x> She's... interesting.
[4:25:43] <tanarath> She's a doll, that's her ghost.
[4:25:44] <+deathwatch308> @ThatChainmecha ive cleared that area or so i thought, which area is that boss close to?
[4:25:50] <SubjectX07x> Her whole ideal is interesting to me as well.
[4:25:53] <ThatChainmecha> the main boss
[4:25:57] <SubjectX07x> But that's fat spoilers.
[4:25:58] <ThatChainmecha> dont want to spoil
[4:26:00] <+deathwatch308> ahhhhh yep
[4:26:03] <Hydrapissed> oh yah
[4:26:07] <SubjectX07x> The most involved in the game.
[4:26:09] <Hydrapissed> moon fuckery
[4:26:10] <+deathwatch308> i member
[4:26:11] <SubjectX07x> It's by far the largest.
[4:26:16] <+MattyNezz> Biggest quest in the game I'm fairly certain
[4:26:20] <%BinaryFireball> its also amazing
[4:26:26] <SubjectX07x> Also the absolute best.
[4:26:28] <+deathwatch308> But its damn good tbf
[4:26:45] <+tumzfestival> and THINK
[4:27:05] <%CptCreampuff16> black knife catacombs for rogier
[4:27:16] <+MattyNezz> There's a castle past Mistwood that doesn't take TOO long to do
[4:27:24] <SubjectX07x> It's the canyon by the minor erdtree.
[4:27:24] <+deathwatch308> what build are you running peach?
[4:27:35] <ThatChainmecha> its the symbol near the big tree
[4:27:37] <azure_dunes> siofra river well is to the right of the erdtree btw
[4:27:39] <ThatChainmecha> on your map
[4:28:20] <+ReallyBigRocks> I wanna say you also went down there and touched the grace already
[4:28:25] <Sunstalker> Click R3 on your map and you can select grace underground Paige
[4:28:29] <bassoontyphoon> What do the squiggles on the map near graces mean?
[4:28:30] <SubjectX07x> Black Knife Catacombs is that canyon we looked for earlier in Liurnia, if you're stopping soon may want to put a marker up there.
[4:28:43] <+tumzfestival> Touch grace + ratio
[4:28:50] <+pectusumbra> DEEP underground
[4:29:00] <+deathwatch308> kill the runebears
[4:29:02] <azure_dunes> the elevator trip down is cool anyways
[4:29:09] <Jack_O_Valentino> This place is great
[4:29:14] <NDenizen> This blew my mind
[4:29:22] <+pectusumbra> watching woolie and reggie's mind get blown seeing this was amazing
[4:29:25] <azure_dunes> yeah my jaw dropped at this
[4:29:30] <+deathwatch308> by far one of the best looking and most infuriating areas in the game
[4:29:33] <SubjectX07x> I accidentally stumbled into Siofra at like level 20 before even going into Stormveil.
[4:29:56] <ThatChainmecha> wait
[4:29:57] <%Fuggins4U> what a skybox
[4:29:58] <+pectusumbra> It really is beautiful. Always makes me think of Overlord
[4:30:02] <ThatChainmecha> patches is a normal npc
[4:30:09] <azure_dunes> I have yet to find patches still :(
[4:30:13] <NDenizen> The funniest part of this is you get all the way through and up in Caelid of all places
[4:30:14] <ThatChainmecha> he showed up as an invader in one boss
[4:30:19] <Bloomingzonda> @pectusumbra It really does look like that
[4:30:22] <+tumzfestival> PAIGE
[4:30:25] <ThatChainmecha> i had no idea that you could find him for real
[4:30:28] <+MattyNezz> You should sit at the grace
[4:30:29] <+flipsilog> lol
[4:30:33] <ThatChainmecha> grace
[4:30:33] <SubjectX07x> @azure_dunes He's in Limgrave in a cave.
[4:30:42] <+MattyNezz> No, like for when you die
[4:30:46] <+deathwatch308> @ThatChainmecha one of the caves in lingrave has him as a merchant
[4:30:46] <ThatChainmecha> use the horse
[4:30:48] <+SneakyBeaver102> You look so cool!
[4:30:48] <+pectusumbra> @pectusumbra It really has that kind of fantasy romance
[4:30:51] <+tumzfestival> Paige punches wildly at her breakfast every morning
[4:30:54] <+MattyNezz> PAtches
[4:30:55] <+deathwatch308> patches
[4:31:00] <SubjectX07x> Nah nah Patches.

[4:31:40] <ThatChainmecha> this place is big
[4:31:42] <NDenizen> mudlads throwing bubbles at you
[4:31:49] <ThatChainmecha> almost as big as limgrave
[4:31:52] <+storebrandcandy> this leads to crab
[4:31:53] <+pectusumbra> also this music is so weird and spooky
[4:31:53] <ThatChainmecha> youll need the horse
[4:31:56] <+pectusumbra> I dig it
[4:31:58] <+tumzfestival> Muck Men?
[4:32:00] <+emberemissary> Use torrent. Can avoid everything. Except laser arrows of death
[4:32:04] <+pectusumbra> claymen

[4:33:25] <Mikers29> I can see clearly now that crab is gone
[4:33:33] <+deathwatch308> @rudiciuscaesar bleed stronk
[4:34:09] <+shootbang_exe> look up
[4:34:12] <Bloomingzonda> Remember when Paige played DS3 and kept running and hiding from the crabs and then like one hitted them as soon as she stopped running
[4:34:28] <+deathwatch308> @Bloomingzonda fear is powerful
[4:34:36] <+MattyNezz> Welcome to the fuck-zone
[4:34:52] <rudiciuscaesar> @deathwatch308 good use of stronk, I like that.
