[1:08:31] <%kyh9> I jsut got booted
[1:08:39] <%kyh9> Game is fun when we actually get to play it
[1:08:39] <+jK00215> this is how the FFBR is gonna be huh?
[1:08:44] <%BinaryFireball> kubberrneetteesss gooooo
[1:08:47] <Krimxon> They're advertising *something* about this game, I don't think it's what Squeenix wanted though
[1:08:47] <Psyramics> Paige killed outriders, singlehandedly
[1:08:54] <+toficque> light my fire
[1:09:03] <%kyh9> It did WAY better than Avengers, ironically
[1:09:10] <hellboy61001> its doing the same thing to me
[1:09:48] <%BinaryFireball> yea because there is only one person in there so it scales difficulty
[1:09:53] <+RandyFistburgers> Oh im in!
[1:10:03] <+BigDumBeak> yea may try rebooting the entire game :C
[1:10:28] <%MarylandJutsu> square why you do this
[1:10:34] <%kyh9> Game is giving me some good ME3 Multiplayer feeling
[1:10:36] <+toficque> doesn't sound very tasty
[1:10:41] <+JobbedBone> fistburgers is a polite young man
[1:10:42] <udurbalanced> Praise be to Handy Wristburger
[1:10:55] <+archangel9889> Why are servers so bad?????
[1:11:00] <$DarkNerdShawny> @randyfistburgers great name
[1:11:25] <+RandyFistburgers> @DarkNerdShawny thx haha
[1:11:26] <%Campfire_Chronicles> @archangel9889 servers cost money, marketing was more successful than anticipated
[1:11:30] <$DarkNerdShawny> @archangel9889 because it's like day 2 of a multi-player game
[1:11:46] <hellboy61001> all game services are bad
[1:11:54] <LeiaSkynoober> Launch day probably
[1:12:19] <+toficque> pretty cool
[1:12:22] <@SoFarFetched> Weird thing is,they've had the demo has been out since late February geefThink which I would think they'd get enough feedback on fixing things.
[1:12:43] <+RealPT1> Sounds like God Hand
[1:12:44] <@Moobot> Check out Outriders here! https://i.try.games/outriders/chmxwn
[1:12:45] <@SoFarFetched> since they were doing twitter updates on fixing stuff.
[1:13:07] <+archangel9889> Avengers sure didn't have a too many people problem :)
[1:13:17] <%Campfire_Chronicles> I think they've been pretty good about transparency with their updates, though some of the stability issues seem like they might be a pain to fix
[1:13:22] <@commanderclaw> I really wanna like Pyromancer, but I feel like a DOT class in a game this fast needs to do more damage per tick
[1:13:28] <hellboy61001> probably everyone's logging in all at once
[1:13:48] <%kyh9> LEvel 30, but enemies can go up to 45 or something
[1:13:52] <@SoFarFetched> Well they just pushed a stability update 2 hours ago.
[1:13:56] <@SoFarFetched> according to their twitter.
[1:14:00] <@SoFarFetched> though thats for PC
[1:14:07] <+jK00215> !outriders
[1:14:07] <@Moobot> Check out Outriders here! https://i.try.games/outriders/chmxwn
[1:14:15] <%Campfire_Chronicles> I think pyromancer is the one thats most dependent on having a synergisitic build with items and abilities etc @commanderclaw
[1:14:37] <%Campfire_Chronicles> feels pretty bad at low levels but i saw some wild stuff with pyromancer late game
[1:14:45] <@commanderclaw> @Campfire_Chronicles I agree, it feels like feast or famine when it comes to having good gear synergy
[1:15:04] <SovPho> did servers shit themselves?
[1:15:16] <hellboy61001> no don't
[1:15:16] <+toficque> balanced for lean
[1:15:18] <%Campfire_Chronicles> you basically need a gun that has fire bullets or its unplayable
[1:15:28] <hellboy61001> i just got in
[1:15:38] <SovPho> yesterday it was... a lot worse
[1:15:44] <Ziegsy> Squares working on a fix for this. They recommend restarting.
[1:16:14] <DynzelWashington> In now.
[1:16:25] <SovPho> I've been in all day, but there are a lot of server farms near where I live :\
[1:16:48] <Psyramics> Can we play Dark Souls and have this open in a picture-in-picture?
[1:16:54] <+toficque> why even mention it?
[1:17:10] <sniffy77> I burnt out hard on destiny 2
[1:17:12] <%AncelDeLambert> they're both shlooters, c'mon Squeenix
[1:17:16] <@SoFarFetched> It does seem like the disconnection is a big problem right now since looking at their recent tweet,a couple of the replies are also people having trouble connecting.
[1:17:16] <%Campfire_Chronicles> cuz everyone looks at the magic gun game and ask "is it destiny"
[1:17:18] <$FoxInABeret> Come on over, come on over bay-bay~
[1:17:28] <+RandyFistburgers> Noice
[1:17:38] <Ziegsy> I spent money on destiny, then I got to the last expac and found... 2 new things to do
[1:17:54] <@SoFarFetched> Yeah its fine
[1:17:54] <SovPho> OPE I just got dc'd
[1:17:56] <%Campfire_Chronicles> yeaaa drop the dead weight
[1:17:58] <SovPho> gdang it
[1:18:04] <+MightyDuckShoes> reminds me more of ME3 multiplayer
[1:18:06] <@SoFarFetched> Just so you can at least do some gameplay.
[1:18:32] <TheWorldRefusedToChange> "that bastard called me deadweight"
[1:18:34] <%BinaryFireball> now it's a race between them all, who will progress the furthest?
[1:18:39] <Ziegsy> Devastator best class! meteor buddies!!
[1:18:50] <SovPho> I like freezing guns with the blue guy's round charge
[1:18:58] <%Campfire_Chronicles> So did Minh beat the game yet?
[1:19:07] <@commanderclaw> Huh, I don't think we can see Paige's HUD
[1:19:22] <%SpaghettiTime44> So this is a "number go up" game?
[1:19:38] <@SoFarFetched> thank you for number
[1:19:48] <Ziegsy> @SpaghettiTime44 Oh for sure. Diablo with guns
[1:19:56] <%Campfire_Chronicles> Number go up, enemies go splat, characters say fuck
[1:20:05] <%Campfire_Chronicles> is pretty much the mood of the game I'd say
[1:20:05] <@SoFarFetched> did you accidentally hide your HUD
[1:20:13] <+Artemis_Scowl> No its a bug
[1:20:15] <@Jekado> did it... not load?
[1:20:15] <@Moobot> Check out Outriders here! https://i.try.games/outriders/chmxwn
[1:20:16] <+Artemis_Scowl> it happens
[1:20:25] <@SoFarFetched> oh it's a bug D:
[1:20:26] <reddpop_> happened to me too, go to your inventory and back out
[1:20:26] <@Jekado> does respawning fix it?
[1:20:27] <%Campfire_Chronicles> Paige doesn't need a hud
[1:20:34] <+one_punman> ultra immersion mode
[1:20:39] <Arancet> @PeachSaliva go to menu to fix
[1:20:41] <@commanderclaw> Paige is too strong for mere information
[1:20:42] <%Campfire_Chronicles> life bars are a distraction when yours never runs out
[1:20:43] <+RandyFistburgers> Realism mode
[1:20:47] <SovPho> i like this game but i feel like it was undertested
[1:21:09] <Ziegsy> I love how shes not using her bullet sponge skills
[1:21:13] <SovPho> There're cutscenes to start loading screens lol
[1:21:19] <%Campfire_Chronicles> @SovPho I think they got a bit rushed to publish by the end of march due to demo popularity
[1:21:26] <@Jekado> it feels really made for console ported to PC from what i've played.
[1:21:44] <Arancet> pull up menu
[1:21:44] <%Campfire_Chronicles> Seem committed to supporting it with future patches though
[1:21:46] <reddpop_> bring up your inventory and back out
[1:21:48] <@Jekado> reticle
[1:22:01] <+Artemis_Scowl> Only way I've seen to fix this, is to go back to the lobby

[1:23:41] <SovPho> but this stream is #sponsored and i appreciate them just making the best of it, i was super frustrated the first time i experienced all this yesterday
[1:24:00] <+toficque> feels a bit undercooked
[1:24:15] <%Campfire_Chronicles> Yeah the way the release date was announced made it seem like "when can you have it ready?" "some time between late march and early may" "Great we'll announce it for March
[1:24:18] <Laioken13> stream sniping
[1:24:19] <Ziegsy> Ive been playing this on console and had no issues, I imagine its super frustrating on pc

[1:25:11] <@Jekado> there are some points where it game is fun but there are some moment to moment problems with it.
[1:25:12] <%SpaghettiTime44> your head asplode
[1:25:17] <@Jekado> its fun to shoot gun which is important.
[1:25:17] <Ziegsy> No money, only merch

[1:26:04] <+whyskeywolfe> You guys can't tell but Paige just winked at the camera as she said that.
[1:26:24] <Ziegsy> She saiys that and then goes to have hardcore puppet sexs.

[1:55:56] <@Moobot> Check out Outriders here! https://i.try.games/outriders/chmxwn
[1:56:01] <+hrudzie_1> is this just third person destiny?
[1:56:02] <X2Eliah> This game looks simultaneously pretty and bland
[1:56:05] <$QueequegTheater> Hit the tree's goopy sacs for a terrible bossfight
[1:56:24] <%radda343> radda343 subscribed with Prime. They've subscribed for 16 months! hello Paige please honk baby
[1:56:25] <+everydayeveryway> Splorch
[1:56:31] <+RedFox91xxx> who is that in the bottom right corner GlitchNRG
[1:56:33] <@SoFarFetched> @naoi0 she didn't wanna fenangle with camera for now since it's going to be a short stream. Cause there was issues with the battery
[1:56:38] <$QueequegTheater> @RedFox91xxx emlo
[1:56:41] <$mckraven> @RedFox91xxx Elmo
[1:56:48] <$WaitHowDidIGetHere> @redfox91xxx That‚Äôs a facecam.
[1:56:52] <%Campfire_Chronicles> ah shit its the gooblins
[1:56:54] <PulverKong> Is this like Fallout 4 with better guns?
[1:57:01] <yourliteraldog> mutants
[1:57:10] <+toficque> framerate goes pop
[1:57:16] <$QueequegTheater> @PulverKong not really, more like Destiny with worse animations
[1:57:23] <+RedFox91xxx> @waithowdidigethere peach is a talking car I knew it GlitchNRG
[1:57:25] <%Campfire_Chronicles> honestly with those hp bars they're basically health packs
[1:57:29] <$FoxInABeret> "Please, Mr. Perforo was my father's name. Call me Snagglefuck."
[1:57:30] <PulverKong> @QueequegTheater ah I just had a fallout/borderlands vibe
[1:57:46] <%Campfire_Chronicles> @PulverKong more like diablo with guns
[1:57:59] <$QueequegTheater> Wait til she looks at the gear screen again, it's blatantly ripped off from Destiny 1/2
[1:58:00] <$WaitHowDidIGetHere> @redfox91xxx A Talking Cat?!‚Ñ¢Ô∏è
[1:58:01] <X2Eliah> The setting is pretty close to berderlands
[1:58:02] <%Campfire_Chronicles> borderlands also a decent comparison but more magic
[1:58:05] <+athuramn> good day, Sir Snagglefuck
[1:58:07] <X2Eliah> borderlands*

[1:58:16] <+RedFox91xxx> GlitchNRG
[1:58:32] <X2Eliah> ... wait actually all these games (destiny, borderlands, anthem, outrides) have very similar setting
[1:58:35] <+toficque> good thing they do no damage
[1:58:49] <+RedFox91xxx> now that's a real gamer move GlitchNRG
[1:58:49] <+captain_thickthighs> you gotta get up the ass as a devistator
[1:58:50] <Puhff> glad to see Paige's Dark Souls strat of "stand there and let the enemy hit you" transferred well to Outriders!
[1:58:54] <PulverKong> I see. I'm currently playing Fallout 76 it has a very similar look
[1:58:55] <ChungusQuest> Eli's self-satisfied chuckle gives me spiritual nourishment.
[1:58:56] <+wah_ha_ha> this is world tier 3, so they are really weak
[1:58:59] <%rumtumtugnutz> @WaitHowDidIGetHere Some dude on the internet told me that movie sucked.
[1:59:15] <X2Eliah> So what is Tier 1 world meant for?
[1:59:17] <@Jekado> its very much her playstyle too
[1:59:18] <$QueequegTheater> So her class is just Krieg from BL2?
[1:59:34] <$WaitHowDidIGetHere> @rumtumtugnutz Judging by what little I‚Äôve seen of it, it does.
[1:59:43] <%rumtumtugnutz> @X2Eliah Tier 1 is basically tutorial
[1:59:46] <+wah_ha_ha> tier 1 is just starter tier, your tiering goes up the more you kill the difficulty of enemies at that level
[1:59:50] <%Campfire_Chronicles> A large group of low-hp melee enemies that deal physical damage. Paige is basically invincible in this area
[1:59:56] <+wah_ha_ha> then you unlock the next tier
[2:00:01] <Puhff> LORE
[2:00:28] <X2Eliah> Man I am getting bigShlooter energy from this game
[2:00:30] <+wah_ha_ha> tier5-7 is like normal mode, below that is easy, and above 7 is hard mode
[2:00:44] <%rumtumtugnutz> The lore of this game is that shit has been fucked because of magic storms for thirty years.
[2:00:45] <MartiusGW> what happened to pat?
[2:00:54] <+wah_ha_ha> difficulty scaling also increases your drop percentage of rarer loot
[2:00:57] <X2Eliah> Servers rejected Pat
[2:01:04] <$QueequegTheater> Pat is it worth grinding the Cronus Lux for the glam if I'm already halfway through getting the Bozja relic for my WAR
[2:01:07] <MartiusGW> oh, poor pat
[2:01:31] <Xelhesia> was that the flood?
[2:01:40] <$WaitHowDidIGetHere> @x2eliah Weird, you‚Äôd think Pat wouldn‚Äôt require much bandwidth.

[2:05:08] <Xelhesia> Outriders has ascended but it left us behind :(
[2:05:10] <+RandyFistburgers> I wonder how many of that is from it coming straight to gamepass
[2:05:11] <+rottingpastry> They planned for like 20k max lol
[2:05:14] <Tracazoid> Good for them at least, server troubles aside
[2:05:15] <+vivaldiva> everyone send your energy to the poor bastards spending their easter long weekend fixing this shit

[2:05:19] <%AncelDeLambert> how the FUCK is this that popular?!

[2:05:27] <$SirGO0SE> 100k + people agree apparently
[2:05:29] <maybefalco> servers just went down im pretty sure?
[2:05:30] <KineticZen> Maybe they shouldn't have hired Joe's Colo to host their gaming desktop from 2016 as a server
[2:05:31] <+cephalon_nyt> yes they could have, but it cost money
[2:05:31] <%blastyoboots> By pressing forward and Heavy Punch, Zangief steps forward and unleashes a monstrous headbutt.
[2:05:32] <reddpop_> Marvel's Avengers only peaked at 25k, and that's Marvel
[2:05:33] <+flechet> shows you what a demo for a half decent game will do
[2:05:33] <%kyh9> its a lot of fun tbh
[2:05:45] <%kyh9> This game has some cool post-campaign dungeons
[2:05:58] <+kknutson4> You guys should co-op in Remnant: From the Ashes
[2:05:59] <%Campfire_Chronicles> the demo basically got all the destiny and warframe crowd interested
[2:06:13] <X2Eliah> .... you have to say it's not Destiny?
[2:06:15] <%MarylandJutsu> you been enjjoying yourself thats good
[2:06:19] <NireFuster> LUL pat
[2:06:21] <SovPho> Pat will and then he'll talk mad shit about the game.
[2:06:22] <+Nekros4442> @PeachSaliva What if the mustard company gave you money though
[2:06:24] <$QueequegTheater> Pat is much more of a big whore, because money go up
[2:06:37] <$QueequegTheater> Despite paige's boots
[2:06:38] <Xelhesia> Outriders made #9 and Subverse made #2 on Steam. This been a good 2 vweekjs

[2:07:16] <bigfastkaratedealership> Space Titties! Subverse!
[2:07:20] <%kyh9> You can actually customize your guns more

[2:07:37] <NeroInfinite> both
[2:07:39] <%Campfire_Chronicles> @Psyramics borderlands
[2:07:40] <Xelhesia> borderlands
[2:07:41] <X2Eliah> it's kinda... both?
[2:07:43] <+captain_thickthighs> both
[2:07:52] <X2Eliah> it's taking like huge inspiration from a lot of these games
[2:07:57] <%kyh9> @Psyramics It's more Mass Effect x Diablo
[2:07:58] <$QueequegTheater> @captain_thickthighs 4 hours, fuck that.  If God wanted me to suffer that much he wouldn't have invented sugar
[2:08:18] <$QueequegTheater> 50 minutes on Sunday, 90 on Easter, that's the deal
[2:08:24] <X2Eliah> Man imagine if this was planned to be a 6 hour stream
[2:08:41] <SovPho> I've gotten two purples and even those are kinda quickly outpaced
[2:08:52] <SovPho> I think the idea is that you pick a gun you really like and you stick with it for a long time by upgrading it?

[2:11:37] <X2Eliah> It's a legit great game
[2:11:46] <@SoFarFetched> should've had Woolie play Kenshi
[2:11:56] <Ziegsy> Have you listening to rude tales of magic? Thats a fun time
[2:12:02] <$QueequegTheater> @PeachSaliva the plot synopsis is "work together to make the child cry by committing war crimes to save your marriage"
[2:12:14] <X2Eliah> spoilerz
[2:12:15] <$SirGO0SE> Woolie's LP is v good of it and the game is probably the best from JF

[2:12:21] <+Codeblue666> Teamviewer is garbage
[2:12:23] <KineticZen> TeamViewer isn't a great idea from a security standpoint
[2:12:34] <+Jiggisnipe> that guy is a scam artist Kappa
[2:12:36] <+keyoray> @QueequegTheater that sounds awesome
[2:12:40] <@SoFarFetched> not your fault paige,who knew 100k people would be playing today
[2:12:43] <%hewlettfan96> TeamViewer sounds awful
[2:12:47] <$QueequegTheater> @keyoray go watch Woolie's streams of it
[2:12:57] <%Campfire_Chronicles> Subverse stream instead?
[2:12:57] <AyotoCorp> I only say TeamViewer because the donation message couldn't fit "a remote desktop app"
[2:12:59] <%BoxNavy> Jebaited ?
[2:13:03] <peyodogo> oo?
[2:13:07] <SovPho> This would've worked out better with a WoW-style queueing system
[2:13:12] <$QueequegTheater> @PeachSaliva Switch to Subverse instead Kappa
[2:13:17] <ItsKrisGBeanie> 2020Snacking
[2:13:23] <+keyoray> <3
[2:13:29] <%TheLemuroid> @Campfire_Chronicles big thanks
[2:13:32] <SovPho> authenticate me daddy
[2:13:45] <$QueequegTheater> I love the idea of pyromancy classes but I love big armor tanking too much
[2:13:47] <+captain_thickthighs> who gonna play subverse? im just gonna wait for the videos to leak
[2:13:52] <bigfastkaratedealership> Peach play subverse to get that double space dick
[2:14:01] <GetGianni> Pyro threw everyone off because they thought it was an All Rounder but it's actually more like Midrange Caster. You gotta Do Combo
[2:14:18] <%kyh9> Pyro is the true glass cannon
[2:14:21] <SovPho> server from is on enoch
[2:14:23] <%kyh9> I'm trying to build for a tank pyromancer
[2:14:24] <$QueequegTheater> Does Paige mean Path of Exile or Pillars of Eternity?
[2:14:25] <SovPho> farm* fuck
[2:14:32] <+captain_thickthighs> it seems in this game its all about that health regen
[2:14:43] <X2Eliah> @QueequegTheater she means PoE
[2:14:48] <%Campfire_Chronicles> Pyro requires the most synergy with your items and abilities @PeachSaliva
[2:14:54] <$QueequegTheater> @X2Eliah >:(
[2:14:56] <SovPho> @captain_thickthighs it varies. Trickster is about kills -> shields -> maintain momentum
[2:14:56] <%SharkMissile> SharkMissile subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 7 months! It was only recently I realized 'glucose guardian' was a play on sugar daddy and not a weird shout out to diabetics.
[2:15:00] <$SirGO0SE> Signed in!
[2:15:04] <%kyh9> Yeah but Pyro seems to have the fewest outright defensive options
[2:15:13] <%kyh9> at least at level 10

[2:19:05] <X2Eliah> Authentiraiders
[2:19:26] <%Campfire_Chronicles> The MC is wild lol
[2:19:27] <+D00msDayDan> that sounds like what destiny's story should be
[2:19:28] <bigfastkaratedealership> Paige bully pat into playing doom 3 vr I‚Äôd ask you but I think you‚Äôd die
[2:19:38] <GetGianni> The story's a god damn blast. And BOTH Outrider VAs are EQUALLY GOOD somehow!
[2:19:43] <%kyh9> It feels like Borderlands honestly
[2:19:50] <+shootbang_exe> kinda wish there was less shaky cam in cutscenes
[2:19:52] <GarbageQueenEllie> Did someone say Detatched Psychopath?! psaDab
[2:19:57] <$QueequegTheater> Isn't that what Destiny's lore actually implies your character's personality is in those games
[2:19:59] <$DarkNerdShawny> only in the side quest really
[2:20:04] <Arancet> your char doesnt give a shit
[2:20:07] <X2Eliah> Oh. So it's inverse Mass Effect Andromeda.
[2:20:10] <Tracazoid> The main character is the funny man in a straight man universe, the opposite of Kiryu in Yakuza
[2:20:20] <Daxalog> Side Stories seem to be walking into the GTA dimension
[2:20:24] <%Campfire_Chronicles> your character is a hardcore gamer
[2:20:25] <SovPho> Main character is just like, "Aight. Whatever."
[2:20:27] <+b_aleph> So  Paige is ¬¥pl
[2:20:30] <AMDBR9S> the only one i can think of is like fallout where u just pick dumb answers
[2:20:33] <GetGianni> the tone of the Outrider is "Heh... Heuhh... Ehhh... Alright..."
[2:20:36] <%kyh9> It's like if you dropped an 80s action hero into the grimmest darkest future possible
[2:20:38] <+b_aleph> playing Leo from GUiilty Gear
[2:20:43] <GarbageQueenEllie> It IS
[2:20:48] <%kyh9> Yeah
[2:20:49] <+rottingpastry> pat with an "I understand that reference"
[2:20:51] <%kyh9> That's how I'm playing
[2:20:53] <$QueequegTheater> @PeachSaliva Pat there's actually a WH40K version of this, he's called Ciaphas Cain
[2:20:55] <+b_aleph> Goddamint I hate when i misclick enter
[2:20:57] <%BoxNavy> is it on pc gamepass? moon2WOW
[2:21:00] <+D00msDayDan> catch the outrider at a diaper brothel
[2:21:04] <+kknutson4> Only free on Xbox, which sucks :(
[2:21:05] <%kyh9> I bought a fucking Series X because of how much shit GamePass was getting.  Also to play with my Series S Girlfriend
[2:21:11] <$DarkNerdShawny> @tracazoid so Ichiban?
[2:21:18] <SovPho> plus the other 500k yeah
[2:21:19] <X2Eliah> It's pretty wild to dump a fresh new game on a gamepass
[2:21:32] <Xelhesia> that would explain alot
[2:21:33] <KineticZen> Thanks Microsoft
[2:21:35] <+captain_thickthighs> i mean they woke up to "so we just went full mad max immediately" I would be like really? as well
[2:21:35] <SovPho> fuck I should've gotten gamepass instead of paying 60 bucks
[2:21:45] <+toastybites> suffering from success
[2:21:48] <$QueequegTheater> The Gamepass Hegemony continues to consume the market
[2:21:50] <+TheotherKristian> Gamepass version is also fucked right now
[2:21:53] <%AncelDeLambert> that explains the numbers, so everyone is demoing it on launch
[2:21:56] <+athuramn> this is some halo ost
[2:22:00] <vonmaultke> 40k? I bet it sucks. They almost never make a good 40k game
[2:22:01] <Xelhesia> well at least people can fly got good sales from this
[2:22:06] <Tracazoid> Yeah kind of like Ichiban
[2:22:09] <%BoxNavy> thank you :)

[2:26:43] <%rumtumtugnutz> Psych is awesome, but I don't know if it would hit for Pat
[2:26:43] <$BlackMage66652> IT'S A JUNGLE OUT THERE
[2:26:44] <%Spydurman> Psych and Monk
[2:26:44] <heartlesshealer> Yeah we remember Monk
[2:26:45] <PinoProxie> pat HATES it
[2:26:45] <+Aleate> Monk was awesome
[2:26:46] <%Spydurman> yes
[2:26:46] <$QueequegTheater> @rottingpastry If Jesus didn't want me to watch porn he wouldn't create so many sexy ethnic ladies
[2:26:53] <%SharkMissile> He was Doc Ock
[2:26:53] <+Movemeister> monk is so good
[2:26:57] <KineticZen> It's Pat the Detective
[2:26:58] <OldManDeckardCain> monk is just Pat, but MUCH smarter
[2:26:59] <seycheles> monk ruled
[2:27:01] <bigfastkaratedealership> psaBig Phoney psaBig Psychic
[2:27:04] <+transporterthesequel> @peachsaliva this is like the best possible way to get Square Enix dosh.
[2:27:07] <GarbageQueenEllie> Remember the one with the poison ice cubes?!?!
[2:27:08] <+captain_thickthighs> super ocd sentai rangers
[2:27:09] <$cade_calrayn> Yeah in Psych, he had to say he was a psychic in order to not be arrested, and then ended up getting stuck with the lie
[2:27:11] <%Spydurman> Monk was one of the first "consultant with weird abilities for detectiveness"
[2:27:15] <%ssjklyco> They do reference Monk at one point in Psych. Won't say where
[2:27:16] <bigfastkaratedealership> Monk is just more ocd pat
[2:27:22] <$QueequegTheater> @PeachSaliva "Pat let's watch the show that's just a much smarter you"
[2:27:22] <%Campfire_Chronicles> psych and monk are basically the same structure, psych has some jokes written about it
[2:27:22] <Ziegsy> I love how on the MONK boxsets, one of the dvds spines doesnt match with the others. Just to annoy ocd
[2:27:31] <+RealThiele> auto-erotic kung fu
[2:27:38] <KineticZen> Nice David Carradine asphyxiation joke Plague
[2:27:39] <Xelhesia> Elementary and Castle were great too
[2:27:40] <%Spydurman> @PeachSaliva I rewatched a couple seasons of Monk recently. It holds up
[2:27:41] <+rottingpastry> kung fu the legend continues had way more autoerotic asphyxiation than I expectecx
[2:27:44] <+rottingpastry> expected
[2:27:45] <%YakumoYomi> Oh shit...that's a callback, Eli. RIP David Carradine.
