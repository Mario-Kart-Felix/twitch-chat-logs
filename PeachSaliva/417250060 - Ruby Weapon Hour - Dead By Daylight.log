[0:57:40] <+EmotionalFatGuy> i heard the escape hatch can't be stalemated either
[0:57:42] <$Corporate_Redeemer> Ash is great. Mettle of Man is the new meta perk
[0:57:43] <TURBOSUPLEX3000> does he actually get a chainsaw arm?
[0:57:45] <anAngryHamster> Is Brenda real ?
[0:57:45] <%AncelDeLambert> I only see Ash punching the killers into submission
[0:57:47] <+PipIV> it's old Ash?
[0:57:48] <televisedrevolting> So Katana Zero is solid. Trippy as hell too.
[0:58:01] <$RaikenTB> 4 slots Kreygasm
[0:58:07] <%AncelDeLambert> how does Ash not just use his gauntlet hand to pummel the killers?
[0:58:09] <@StridentSong> @PeachSaliva PTR has it as 3 minutes, Meter slowed when a survivor is downed, and Ash is great, but some of his perks are for advanced play (i,e, Mettle of Man)
[0:58:12] <+demon1103> wait...but is that Ash...or Ashley? there's a big difference
[0:58:14] <deviljhojho94> Katana looks good even if it is short

So after careful thinking I know which Infinity Gem would be mained by you guys. Paige would use the Mind Gem to be able to solve shadow puzzles faster by 2 seconds and Pat would use the Space Gem and no doubt it would give him ultimate armor in the form of his freaking cube. I wonder what Elmo’s would be...have fun Queen Peach Bee!! 🤣

[1:15:10] <%MrSuperCasualBoom> Singapore?
[1:15:11] <$RaikenTB> The servers don't exist yet.
[1:15:12] <TheGershon> Good morning to you too
[1:15:13] <nyghtmare42> Ptb is testing dedicated servers
[1:15:16] <Luesagna00> yellow like da masturd
[1:15:19] <@StridentSong> They want to do dedicated servers, but they havne't done them yet
[1:15:26] <Dhurkst> Ash! :D
[1:15:26] <DedlokPM> @StridentSong the pts has dedicated servers right now
[1:15:27] <$Mendin> Dedicated servers... in Ohio?
[1:15:30] <@StridentSong> Ahh
[1:15:33] <%Faustgesicht> Prestige Ash? Damn
[1:15:34] <%AncelDeLambert> dedicated servers might be a terrible idea depending how they do it
[1:15:37] <$Mendin> Chicago was too expensive?
[1:15:38] <The_Butterfly_Man> they did test them
[1:15:40] <%ElenaManetta> DbD never had company-dedicated servers?
[1:15:42] <@StridentSong> I didn't know the PTB had dedicated servers now
[1:15:45] <+mh9s> I'm only here for the mustard cube
[1:15:45] <$Corporate_Redeemer> They're rolling dedicated servers out with this ptb
[1:15:47] <%AncelDeLambert> hosting is just so much cheaper
[1:15:52] <DedlokPM> Oh. Thought that was the main reason for this PTB
[1:15:56] <The_Butterfly_Man> I think they are still on the ptb
[1:16:01] <%ElenaManetta> That sounds like the killer always has a latency advantage!
[1:16:03] <JumbleJams> why would you put anything ohio? don't they know hell is real here?
[1:16:03] <xTickLe> if I'm correct they are using amazon based Web servers
[1:16:07] <%MrSuperCasualBoom> Dedicated Servers would give Paige mustard on a fancy dish
[1:16:08] <The_Butterfly_Man> yea the killer host the game on the live version
[1:16:11] <fearhurst> Hosting is cheaper but its genuinely ass for most any game
[1:16:11] <+VidyaFranX> sad oinks
[1:16:14] <%AncelDeLambert> @ElenaManetta he needs it, I can assure you
[1:16:16] <%Remery_> Is piggy getting buffs?
[1:16:20] <%ElenaManetta> aw geeze!
[1:16:25] <@StridentSong> The original way it worked was the Killer acted as the host server. The Dedicated servers was something they've wanted to do for years. Didn't know they were testing it in the PTB
[1:16:25] <%ElenaManetta> RIP all killers
[1:16:27] <nyghtmare42> The Fog Whisperer I watch said PTB is testing dedicated.
[1:16:28] <$Corporate_Redeemer> Ohio? Why Ohio of all places?
[1:16:29] <+VidyaFranX> She getting nerfs, baby
[1:16:30] <fearhurst> Hosting killed mgo3
[1:16:31] <%AncelDeLambert> Honestly, the netcode for this game is pretty excellent, it balances latency very well
[1:16:33] <%RedMageRebel> how hard is this game to get into, cause I dig horror movies and this seems fun from paiges streams
[1:16:38] <illicitdonut> Good morning!
[1:16:45] <%MrSuperCasualBoom> Bong’s?
[1:16:50] <lionsignal> can't scape with an active be
[1:16:53] <%Remery_> @Corporate_Redeemer Because there's nothing there,
[1:16:53] <$Corporate_Redeemer> They nerfed Pig and NOBODY is happy
[1:17:05] <%AncelDeLambert> @RedMageRebel the difficulty curve isn't that bad
[1:17:05] <lionsignal> beartrap*
[1:17:11] <junkyardangel> this game is super easy to get into. The core mechanics are super Basic.
[1:17:14] <$RaikenTB> Nice shot PogChamp
[1:17:15] <$Polarix64> Huntress
[1:17:15] <+Ascethetic> im still big on doctor
[1:17:18] <+soundcloud_raptor> you should try hypnospace outlaw, its the best
[1:17:18] <%AncelDeLambert> depends on whether you decide to main survivor or killer
[1:17:19] <fearhurst> lit up
[1:17:23] <astrojunk13> ohayo
[1:17:26] <superbla25> I like playing trapper.
[1:17:30] <fearhurst> yatta
[1:17:31] <%Keyd00d> ohayou
[1:17:31] <$Mendin> Big Strong Slavic Woman coming to pick up Paige
[1:17:36] <deviljhojho94> just stab them 4Head
[1:17:40] <Ricochet0> @RedMageRebel Very easy. On Rank 20, where you start, everyone is a beginner. But you will learn quickly and it is mad fun :)
[1:17:40] <nyghtmare42> I heard that Legion is actually broken, not nerfed. Huh.
[1:17:44] <%AncelDeLambert> oooooh, Huntreess
[1:17:53] <Huntercd> Does Ashe have a shotgun?
[1:17:58] <%RedMageRebel> I just heard the community can be a bit much if you don't play perfectly
[1:18:00] <@StridentSong> What did they change with Legion?
[1:18:01] <%Remery_> God I love Huntress, tuck me in with your lullaby
[1:18:03] <kc703> thank you pat for turning me onto marijuana best thing ive done for myself
[1:18:06] <%AncelDeLambert> how on EARTH did she see you?!
[1:18:06] <fearhurst> Gatorade G2 Recover
[1:18:07] <+demon1103> only played a little of this game, but out of Base killers, Huntress was def favorite
[1:18:07] <aimlesshealer> I want Huntress to carry me on her shoulder
[1:18:09] <+VidyaFranX> @Huntercd No, but he has a hand puppet
[1:18:10] <%Keyd00d> LUL

[1:18:14] <%starotter70> ok
[1:18:14] <Ion_Laser> GET FUCKED
[1:18:14] <%RedMageRebel> but here it seems to be all good things! I'll check it out
[1:18:15] <+Tearonex> So very brave
[1:18:16] <+HostilePoundcakes> LUL
[1:18:17] <%AncelDeLambert> great team, good job
[1:18:20] <nmaten> smart killer
[1:18:22] <The_Butterfly_Man> @nyghtmare42 legion was never really good just annoying so now legion is not annoying
[1:18:23] <%Remery_> Punish her momm
[1:18:24] <nmaten> that was the right play
[1:18:29] <Ricochet0> @nyghtmare42 Actually, the opinions are quite split. Some think he is more shit than ever, others believe Legion is fun and good now.
[1:18:35] <$Mendin> She's probably running that hex that counts downed survivors
[1:18:44] <$Mendin> So she's rapidly approaching Maximum Power
[1:18:44] <%MrSuperCasualBoom> Claudumbass more like it
[1:18:45] <+risenchudjr> DEERSTALKER
[1:18:49] <%Remery_> might have deerstalker
[1:18:55] <%AncelDeLambert> oh, you know what? She has the Wraith ability for the blood
[1:18:59] <$Solidnick18> ight
[1:19:02] <DedlokPM> Lack of BBQ and Chili Confirmed. teenD
[1:19:03] <$Corporate_Redeemer> Legion was definitely nerfed. Huntress is bugged in that she can down all four survivors at once if she hits them all in the end with a collateral hatchet
[1:19:04] <nyghtmare42> @the_butterfly_man gotcha. Good to know
[1:19:09] <%Keyd00d> Dwight Must Hide mode
[1:19:24] <$Mendin> Nope, Wraith
[1:19:34] <%MrSuperCasualBoom> Paige doing the...Dwight thing.
[1:19:40] <$Mendin> You can cloak as Wraith and bloodhound everyone forever, it's crazy
[1:19:41] <+risenchudjr> Twice
[1:19:48] <vingadivo> what does dwight do gang?
[1:19:51] <MonstarGrrrl> wait i can see blood! am i a ghost ?

[1:20:08] <darwinyoshi> @darwinyoshi is new here. Say hello! VoHiYo
[1:20:08] <DedlokPM> @PeachSaliva Spirit's blood thing is she can't see survivors, but can see their blood and scratchmarks when she uses her power
[1:20:09] <fearhurst> put on some headchromes
[1:20:12] <Ricochet0> The Hanged one has Kindred
[1:20:13] <$joylent_blue> VoHiYo
[1:20:17] <+hobojo153> You can tell it's true love because Pat gave up his cube

[1:21:57] <aimlesshealer> Air Bud, but the dog is a JPEG
[1:22:03] <$connos_livereview> apatJpeg
[1:22:03] <The_Butterfly_Man> @vingadivo every survivor is really just a cosmetic choice the thing that affects survivors is their perks and all survivors can get the same perks
[1:22:04] <DedlokPM> apatJpeg
[1:22:05] <%Keyd00d> They'll do that Pat
[1:22:07] <+hobojo153> Say no to dog racism kids
[1:22:17] <+yeknomlive> like inferno cop but with airbud
[1:22:19] <%starotter70> How many times do we need to teach you this lesson!?
[1:22:21] <vingadivo> oh ok thanks chat
[1:22:21] <fearhurst> air bud but the dog is a pig and cant do anything
[1:22:21] <+ceaselessdiplomacy> airbud is a trash movie for trash people
[1:22:28] <%umbypokochan> of course it's stupid.. it's a movie for dogs
[1:22:30] <InugamiTheHound> what kind of dog should play as air bud in the air bud reboot? @PeachSaliva
[1:22:33] <fearhurst> I meant pug
[1:22:35] <tUxUt> why is pat talking about air bud
[1:22:35] <DedlokPM> But there is no rule that says a dog can't play basketball! mogsLoud
[1:22:43] <+river_city98> they slam dunked the dog?
[1:22:45] <kc703> throw the ball at the dogs face
[1:22:46] <weissguard> Ace Combat, but apatJpeg is the Pilot.
[1:22:47] <energywarning> air bud turned into air bruised
[1:22:51] <Laironx3> TTours OhMyDog
[1:22:52] <$OlCaptainRed> paige has entered [The Cube]
[1:22:52] <aimlesshealer> Science can fix this!
[1:22:55] <%rumtumtugnutz> I'm pretty sure they do, in fact, have rules that say a dog can't play basketball
[1:22:57] <$joylent_blue> he was a good dog
[1:23:02] <Iggeh0> dumb dog
[1:23:03] <%MrSuperCasualBoom> I hope no one tells Pat that did a Air Bud sequel where he was a pro wrestler.
[1:23:03] <TURBOSUPLEX3000> how does a dog dribble
[1:23:06] <$joylent_blue> didnt' get hazard pay though
[1:23:06] <Ricochet0> Does Paige have Self-Care?
[1:23:08] <DrkJP520> Also dogs can't look up
[1:23:12] <+hobojo153> At least it's not Milo and Otis
[1:23:14] <Huntercd> Dog don't have thumbs
[1:23:27] <fearhurst> How does my dog look up at me
[1:23:30] <+Grey_Frog> Is Pat high?
[1:23:36] <$joylent_blue> hobojo153 you, stop that, right now
[1:23:36] <DedlokPM> Pat doesn't have to look down to look at the boobies
[1:23:37] <+river_city98> prosthetic dog thumbs
[1:23:43] <Vohs_Bru> Wow a unicorn, Paige is streaming
[1:23:52] <kc703> haha
[1:23:55] <%Remery_> There's a weird bug on console where the wiggle prompt is below the player as soon as the match starts and because of that, the survivor can barely run.
[1:23:56] <copious_koopies> let paige finish first
[1:23:57] <lethallylactic> Kreygasm
[1:23:58] <Ricochet0> She isn't moving. Healing is a bit finicky at the moment
[1:23:58] <+griffball13> RUB RUB RUB
[1:23:59] <+hobojo153> @Grey_Frog She got smoked
[1:23:59] <$TootPirate> starM

[1:24:11] <+StooEsq> turn your head and cough
[1:24:12] <vingadivo> you're both going to die
[1:24:20] <lionsignal> reiki
[1:24:20] <juxtest> Dwight always finishes first
[1:24:26] <TwinBat> sexy dwight moans
[1:24:27] <SirSmudgey> You should heal before finishing a gen so the killer doesn't know your location while healing
[1:24:28] <vingadivo> just give it a little kiss
[1:24:30] <+Sighden> How is the cube for you Peach?
[1:24:34] <%MrSuperCasualBoom> That Dwight Ass mechanics
[1:24:37] <%Remery_> Just use firecrackers instead
[1:24:47] <%AncelDeLambert> @PeachSaliva Run through a window and use the flashlight in the killer's eyes when they climb through. A guy did it to me, it works really well.
[1:24:48] <+Tearonex> apatCrazyhand apatCrazyhead
[1:24:49] <InugamiTheHound> why is paige's arm to spread apart??
[1:24:50] <%starotter70> It's simple, just don't stare directly into the light
[1:24:52] <nmaten> pats gonna get more high
[1:24:53] <+griffball13> Big shit
[1:24:57] <aimlesshealer> Be sure to use your seatbelt, Pat
[1:25:00] <+hobojo153> Quick send him messages under the door
[1:25:01] <$joylent_blue> be cool about bathroom safety
[1:25:03] <Vohs_Bru> If you want to have these kind of tables why dont you just go back to school?
[1:25:05] <tUxUt> @PeachSaliva how are you feeling about the gamercube?
[1:25:07] <The_Butterfly_Man> yea the timing for flash light saves are tougher then they were before you kinda have to follow the killer and be right there to get a save
[1:25:08] <%Chichen> have you considered getting a CUBE for the toilet?
[1:25:09] <%ceaselessdiplomacy> ceaselessdiplomacy subscribed with Twitch Prime. They've subscribed for 4 months! 
[1:25:12] <%furiousfurioso> furiousfurioso subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 28 months! 
[1:25:14] <Ion_Laser> be better than Rich Evans at fire safety
[1:25:15] <%umbypokochan> i swear every time Paige streams my cat just won't leave me alone :(
[1:25:16] <%xx_killa_mila_xx> comence dropping the heat
[1:25:19] <+river_city98> Pat's off to break the toilet again - preemptively call the plumber

[1:26:12] <JumbleJams> the shadows of his eyes?

[1:26:22] <Dhurkst> Sudden thought: Jack Baker would be fantastic for this game.
[1:26:24] <ElemethSigma> Did Paige kill Pat and steal his cube?
[1:26:29] <ghostoctopus1602> Pats gotta feed the toilet

[1:41:31] <VRNK> or are there several fast food witches
[1:41:32] <Ion_Laser> Recharge with The Cube
[1:41:33] <Ricochet0> Do you have DS?
[1:41:37] <JumbleJams> pat at risk
[1:41:40] <+DukeMoose> Paige hasnt broken the GYPSY curse yet?
[1:41:43] <httpjessicae> feng min best girl
[1:41:44] <%stovetopism> Everyday a new curse
[1:41:45] <+VidyaFranX> Lithe is so much better
[1:41:45] <TheGershon> Pat should drink another RedBull(tm) to bring his energy up
[1:41:48] <$HentaiSenpai9K> I'm certain Paige is actually possesd by an Eldritch entity
[1:41:49] <httpjessicae> love alert
[1:41:50] <Ricochet0> Decisisve Strike
[1:41:53] <DedlokPM> Decisive Strike
[1:41:54] <$Polarix64> No she doesn't have DS
[1:41:54] <energywarning> dual screen
[1:41:55] <+maxamillion629> Just release the curse
[1:41:55] <DesuDesuDokiDoki> dark souls
[1:41:58] <%Keyd00d> dual screen
[1:42:00] <%SWFanatic> dick sucking
[1:42:00] <%rumtumtugnutz> must have been a hell of a handy.
[1:42:08] <MSN04_Sazabi> lmao paige just use DS, Dead Hard and Sprint Burst Kappa
[1:42:12] <$Polarix64> Only on Laurie
[1:42:12] <+DukeMoose> Completion Points?
[1:42:12] <Ricochet0> DS helps against tunneling
[1:42:14] <JumbleJams> paige needs to return the slab
[1:42:16] <lionsignal> premonition is best perk
[1:42:18] <$joylent_blue> double dwight
[1:42:22] <astrojunk13> topless beef again
[1:42:22] <%MrSuperCasualBoom> Does she have the GBA?
[1:42:27] <+Mekhet09> This grind looks awful.
[1:42:47] <+Mekhet09> You have like no perks and the bosses are running around in max. That's not fair.
[1:42:47] <$joylent_blue> fuck that, does she have a GBA SP?
[1:42:56] <%SWFanatic> apathy is death
[1:42:57] <$Polarix64> Having DS on anybody but Laurie in the test build is rare unless you grind which doesn't make sense in a PTB
[1:43:07] <+xenoriddley36> Paige, favorite Wii game, go
[1:43:12] <Ricochet0> @Mekhet09 It's tolerable. Perks like BBQ and We're gonna Live forever helps smoothen it alot
[1:43:14] <+JorgenTheElf> knowing is half the battle
[1:43:16] <DesuDesuDokiDoki> paiges build is built around sight LUL
[1:43:16] <%MrSuperCasualBoom> @joylent_blue Does this game have GB Micro...transactions? #dadjokes
[1:43:29] <TheGershon> The Saturn?
[1:43:30] <%NWR_James> Paige had a CDi
[1:43:30] <deviljhojho94> the wii and the wii u were mistakes
[1:43:33] <%SWFanatic> bonk's adventure
[1:43:34] <JoeStillLife> Ngage
[1:43:37] <energywarning> the only wee she likes is pat
[1:43:39] <nmaten> no
[1:43:43] <TheGershon> The wii was absolutely not a mistake
[1:43:45] <$RaikenTB> My aunt had an atari LUL
[1:43:45] <%NWR_James> Wii made million billion dollars.
[1:43:49] <+maxamillion629> @jorgentheelf the other half of the battle is gun
[1:43:49] <+river_city98> commodore 64?
[1:43:49] <$Corporate_Redeemer> A Dreamcast?
[1:43:51] <$joylent_blue> my favorite Wii games are games that were on other systems first monkaS
[1:43:52] <InugamiTheHound> @AngriestPat I got Mesa prime and Zephyr prime and Stradavar today.
[1:43:54] <Psyramics> you had a 3DO?
[1:43:54] <TwinBat> did you have an ouya?
[1:43:56] <+xenoriddley36> consolation then, 3DS?
[1:43:59] <DesuDesuDokiDoki> lewd
[1:44:06] <lionsignal> no more heroes!
[1:44:08] <$joylent_blue> okami, twilight princess
[1:44:08] <Ion_Laser> I loved the Dreamcast
[1:44:08] <deviljhojho94> The wii and its controller both were errors then Keepo
[1:44:10] <+cappyd33> paige had a virtual boy
[1:44:16] <Ricochet0> But it had Sonic Adventure 1 and 2 :(
[1:44:17] <TheGershon> I have a dreamcast right next to me
[1:44:22] <Mordox> wii is great
[1:44:25] <IminyourBase> yeh but the dreamcast was the best flop because you could get all the games for free
[1:44:25] <InugamiTheHound> the gamecube was the last Nintendo system I bought after that I fell out of in love with Nintendo.
[1:44:28] <$Polarix64> The Wii was fine but yeah considering practically every good Wii U got ported to the Switch the Wii U probably was a mistake
[1:44:29] <The_Butterfly_Man> I want my shirtless Myers dammit
[1:44:30] <+xenoriddley36> Blue Stinger is my favorite game on the Dreamcast
[1:44:35] <nmaten> did they fix the wraith? cause he was so bad
[1:44:36] <$Corporate_Redeemer> BING BONG
[1:44:40] <Dhurkst> The Wii was great, but it didn't have enough hardcore games.
[1:44:43] <InugamiTheHound> the dream cast has power stones 1 and that game is fucking amazing!
[1:44:44] <Ricochet0> Wraith is bugged at the moment. It is the old wraith from a loooooong time ago
[1:44:48] <abakkus> im back with food are we winning
[1:44:49] <DrkJP520> The Switch should've been called the Wii Wii
[1:44:50] <$Corporate_Redeemer> Wraithbis pretty good
[1:44:54] <%mayorrev> BibleThump
[1:44:57] <deviljhojho94> Wii: Revengeance

[1:45:07] <$joylent_blue> bye hot shirtless dude :(
[1:45:11] <DesuDesuDokiDoki> hummy mommy
[1:45:11] <%stovetopism> Still waiting on those wind waker and twilight princess hd ports to switch cuz i never owned a gamecube and wii u....
[1:45:18] <ElemethSigma> Wii suffered from developers not wanting to code their games for the wiimote so you had a ton of shitty shovelware on it
[1:45:19] <+Sighden> well at least we know she's played the gamecube, she's sitting in it even
[1:45:21] <%mayorrev> nice esports jersey nerd
[1:45:22] <$RaikenTB> she has no ass.
[1:45:26] <TheGershon> Anyone ever played Cosmic Smash on DC?
[1:45:30] <rosabellamelantha> she has no style
[1:45:32] <%nofestu2> that bitch cray
[1:45:34] <deviljhojho94> The wiimote is what fucked the wii over
[1:45:36] <InugamiTheHound> The wii the console everyone bought but bought no games for it. The wiiU the failure of console that had some good console.
[1:45:38] <+DukeMoose> why arnt you wearing a Gamer dress?1
[1:45:39] <+xenoriddley36> @ElemethSigma the amount of shovelware on the wii was staggering
[1:45:39] <%Keyd00d> bird up
[1:45:39] <$joylent_blue> she has no grace
[1:45:40] <VJdarkworld> paige is in reverse-gamer cube position
[1:45:40] <Ricochet0> @PeachSaliva You will meet a lot of Huntresses in the PTB. It is the most sensible Killers to test Frame stuttters
[1:45:44] <copious_koopies> bitches be crazay
[1:45:59] <$Polarix64> Huntress might have Huntress basement skill
[1:46:05] <%MrSuperCasualBoom> If Paige made a handheld system it be called the Little Unit Platform Universal System or LUPUS
[1:46:10] <InugamiTheHound> @PeachSaliva=Esports
[1:46:19] <%mayorrev> Is that the Lachine High Lasers? @PeachSaliva
[1:46:34] <MarylandJutsu> no its the laser bears
[1:46:42] <nmaten> bbq and chili
[1:46:42] <$joylent_blue> poor dwight, with his GET SMOKED hat
[1:46:42] <$Polarix64> I think that's the same Huntress you fought earlier
[1:46:48] <%Chichen> how was your big boy poop pat? Do you need a CUBE for the toilet?
[1:46:51] <Ricochet0> NO!
[1:46:51] <AccusedPheonix> The way Paige is resting her left cannot be comfy,surely?
[1:46:52] <ElemethSigma> like the WiiU, Xbox360, and PS3 generation I skipped, almost nothing from that time interested me outside of Dark Souls, which I have on the PC
[1:47:01] <%Bt_Robot> @PeachSaliva do you take Triptans? they're a new headache medication that works well against migraines.
[1:47:07] <AccusedPheonix> Wrist*

[1:49:11] <$Polarix64> @Ricochet0 I know that skill is garbage but since this is the PTB it might be possible that's shes using it probably not but you never know

[1:55:26] <$Corporate_Redeemer> @cappuccinoguil It's so low of a chance that it's a running joke that killers have to "Respect the 4%" if you ever manage to unhook yourself.
[1:55:28] <Ricochet0> @vingadivo Huntress is slower, but she throws Hatchets that she finds in Lockers. Also, the Humming she does is bigger than her Terror Radius, so Survivors have a bit aof auditory warning she's coming
[1:55:29] <DesuDesuDokiDoki> W I G G L E
[1:55:33] <+EmotionalFatGuy> is that a whoopie cushion the killer has on his belt
[1:55:34] <%stovetopism> Kaballin
[1:55:37] <lionsignal> the killer can close the hatch now its such bs
[1:55:43] <Prism_Wing> Sometimes you just gotta do an Ollie 360.

[2:05:02] <%stovetopism> I never watch monster musume but since i saw suu became a godzilla i have to go against my redhead bias and side with her
[2:05:05] <+xenoriddley36> The feel of vomiting in hair
[2:05:15] <agadejobi> Are we talking about lamia?
[2:05:17] <thegreenbenis> HEY PAIGE
[2:05:18] <SirSmudgey> disconnects are why you need to play with friends
[2:05:29] <%xx_killa_mila_xx> Hi, Dwight. I'm Chris Hansen. Why don't you have a seat??
[2:05:32] <$RaikenTB> Disconnects are great if you're playing killer LUL
[2:05:34] <%mayorrev> @PeachSaliva can you potentially break all the hooks?
[2:05:42] <Mnightshyamallama> does the killer get alerted when you dismantle a hook?
[2:05:42] <dsauce999> Suu is nice, i also like the chuuni Dullahan too.
[2:05:47] <pectusumbra> The answer to monster musume is Dopple
[2:05:56] <CappuccinoGuil> Did she win? I was away for like, 5 minutes
[2:05:59] <Anxietydecending> Does a disconnect replace the character with an AI of just get rid of them
[2:06:01] <+xenoriddley36> Tio is my fave because I love tal muscle women
[2:06:03] <Ricochet0> @mayorrev no. All broken hooks regenerate after one minute.
[2:06:03] <httpjessicae> a really good tip for sabotaging is to get it to 99% and then drop it just as they come so it starts the 3 minute timer later and you have more time to dance around it @PeachSaliva
[2:06:08] <%mayorrev> ohh ok
[2:06:10] <pectusumbra> aka pick all the girls in one
[2:06:10] <$joylent_blue> she died like a winner CappuccinoGuil
[2:06:11] <copious_koopies> the killer does get an alert
[2:06:11] <+xenoriddley36> Also, Zombina is just adorable
[2:06:17] <vingadivo> how does every single survivor know how to fix the generators
[2:06:21] <CaptainKarite> i think it's the same alert as if you fudged a generator
[2:06:36] <dsauce999> OH NO, I forgot Zombina NotLikeThis
[2:06:44] <%kiiiirsten> OMG
[2:06:49] <+xenoriddley36> shes just so cute

[2:12:32] <%Birdigalore> I love Taco Bell. All praise the meat tube!
[2:12:35] <%MrSuperCasualBoom> You put cheese on a taco = disqualified.
[2:12:36] <dsauce999> Acutally, as many Chalupas as humanely possible

[2:16:03] <DedlokPM> And the hag can teleport to triggered traps within a certain range of her. And she also gets alerted by the traps
[2:16:05] <$FrostMass22> Isn't Nurse slowest?
[2:16:07] <%SWFanatic> big and strong
[2:16:11] <deviljhojho94> Just kill her 4Head
[2:16:11] <$LocDogX86X> dats power damn
[2:16:12] <+VidyaFranX> You gotta hug those loops tighter
[2:16:13] <Ricochet0> @FrostMass22 It's an Design Thing. Killers are supposed to be these abominable beings that the Survivors call to each other by Titles
[2:16:16] <Ion_Laser> @MoulesFritz papa john's pizza has no taste to it compared to other pizza chains
[2:16:18] <%MrBorisMakarov> slugging everyone probably
[2:16:24] <dsauce999> Oh yeah, Baja Blast is best Dew Flavor
[2:16:28] <+InstiGaitan> hi momma peach
[2:16:28] <$Corporate_Redeemer> I always get bottles at Baja Blast at my local corner stores
[2:16:32] <flame_of_udun_> Lol you weren’t worth it apparently

[2:16:54] <AFlyingTaco1> Baja Blast is so fucking goddamn good jesus fuck
[2:16:56] <$FrostMass22> @Ricochet0 That makes sense. Assuming this universe doesn't have the horror movies the characters are from, the survivors wouldn't use their (TM) names
[2:16:57] <Ricochet0> @FrostMass22 Sry, they name them
[2:17:02] <deviljhojho94> ya rly

[2:17:28] <thegreenbenis> Heretic. @pariasa
[2:17:28] <DedlokPM> @PeachSaliva The fact that the hag found you/followed you to the basement was probably because you sabotaged the hook
[2:17:28] <Niney_Who> Why do you have Multiple
[2:17:29] <CriticKitten> Amazing
[2:17:30] <+InstiGaitan> @pariasa you're wrong
[2:17:33] <Ricochet0> @FrostMass22 Exactly. The Lore is well thought out and explains even small details
[2:17:33] <+VidyaFranX> Why don't you croutch

I agree with what chat's been saying, kira would be a great killer. He could lay an explosive trap, or send out sheer heart attack to track people. Josuke could be added as a survivor, and would be able to see kira's stand, and get better repair times. Maybe add koichi, who could slow down killers within a small radius, ala 3 freeze

[2:47:54] <%GarbageNirvana> Not the fucking black widows we get out here
[2:47:55] <$joylent_blue> i also had a spider roommate, but he was just a daddy long legs, he was cool
[2:47:58] <SkitsofRandom> I wish I had the mental strength to not kill all spiders on sight

[2:48:15] <thegreenbenis> A spider built a colony in a corner of my room, I gassed the fuck out of them.
[2:48:20] <%Chichen> @PeachSaliva I had a spider hang down from the ceiling in front of my face while I was playing Dark Souls and it nearly killed me both in game and real life

[2:48:48] <Vexed_Cassidy> The worst is when those massive gigantic ones run across my living room floor at 1am and I don’t know where they’ve gone, there’s no escape @peachsaliva
[2:48:48] <Rhinoprotoss> If it was small for Pat it must be really small
[2:48:53] <$joylent_blue> yo i AGREE
[2:48:57] <%Ell1ot> uh...

[2:49:24] <+DoctorWrenchcoat> The Cackling Knife Spider is actually a harmless species.
[2:49:24] <MSN04_Sazabi> There are no poisonous spiders in Canada
[2:49:24] <%Ell1ot> can we keep talking about crazy laughing knife Pat?

[2:50:04] <$Brother_Coduss> @PeachSaliva what would you do if you found one of those big ass huntsmen spiders they have in australia in your house? the ones that hide behind picture frames
[2:50:04] <medjoe> Nah, black widow is creeping up the south border
[2:50:05] <RileyOMalley> I had the cutest lil spider that would hang out on my computer tower. He also was a helpful lil dude eating the gnats that fluttered in my room. I fed them to him and he really didn't mind chilling there
[2:50:05] <$joylent_blue> the only venomous spiders we have around here are black widows, those are fun
[2:50:07] <a_mad_dragon> that's bullshit, there's black widows
[2:50:08] <+FloorBurger> its too cold
[2:50:10] <Prism_Wing> @vjdarkworld Then scorpions and crabs are next.
[2:50:11] <+timblenaut> most spiders die due to the ultra-cold

[2:53:42] <%ElenaManetta> There has never been a bigger lie in life than "I should read Homestuck just so I understand all the references and the hullabullo"

[2:54:15] <$RaikenTB> @Remery_ No that's Pluto.
[2:54:18] <televisedrevolting> I had a dream about Paige and Pat doing a Let's Read of Homestuck and it was alright.
[2:54:18] <%MrSuperCasualBoom> cheer200 Be real. You were cool with your roommate Spider until you try to catch it with a pokeball and it said “Screw you, Paige! Find a new small critter to annoy” and that’s how her and Pat eventually met. Thanks Spider roommate for bringing them two together.
[2:54:29] <$FrostMass22> It's snowing where I am right now
[2:54:29] <HeadsHeldHigh> Gamer cube protects against everything, even sex

[3:15:01] <+absolute_cagemony> The point of the game is to win and get cosmetics for big swagger.
[3:15:02] <%dukenux> >winning at games
[3:15:05] <%dukenux> what is this 2009
[3:15:07] <%starotter70> The point is to not get second place
[3:15:10] <copious_koopies> can't be wholesome without spilling some blood
[3:15:29] <MarylandJutsu> Trying to Win? GROSS
[3:15:38] <KungFuStarfish> Dwight looks like a vlogger lol
[3:15:43] <+FloorBurger> Im so sorry I murdered you. <3
[3:15:49] <DesuDesuDokiDoki> race war now?
[3:15:51] <Badgerconda_> It's like Peach has never been on the internet before.
[3:15:53] <$joylent_blue> who does that
[3:15:53] <LVDoomien> racial slurs are so trash
[3:15:54] <+BakedPretzels> i dont get what people get out of doing that limesGrump
[3:15:56] <%starotter70> Sounds about right
[3:15:58] <%Remery_> Yea most groups act like that
[3:16:01] <+MechaBaphomet> probably edgy kids
[3:16:03] <+butch_deadlift> is only game, why you heff to be mad
[3:16:11] <%dukenux> it kinds spoils fun for everyone else
[3:16:11] <+applemon198> having fun in an online game is unheard of to some people
[3:16:13] <%stovetopism> Racial slurs? What is this high school?
[3:16:14] <Rhinoprotoss> That's the internet
[3:16:17] <damienlunas> Paige expected better of people
[3:16:24] <copious_koopies> were they saying the pwediepie bridge word?
[3:16:24] <+Troispoint> Did Pat ever meet Dick Masterson? If not, it needs to happen
[3:16:25] <aimlesshealer> @stovetopism worse: it's the internet
[3:16:26] <SirSmudgey> People shit talk killers all the time, because they're the "bad guy"
[3:16:26] <%starotter70> Hive Mind
[3:16:28] <abakkus> is only game, why you haff to be racist piece of shit
[3:16:35] <damienlunas> Paige always expects the best of you so be your best peoples
[3:16:41] <$FrostMass22> @Troispoint Paige has been on the Dick Show several times
[3:16:45] <LVDoomien> the internet being the internet isn't an excuse for racial slurs boyos
[3:16:51] <+Troispoint> @FrostMass22 that's why I'm asking lol
[3:16:54] <DesuDesuDokiDoki> hum~ hum~ hum~
[3:16:55] <+absolute_cagemony> Women who play video games are all fermernists.
[3:16:59] <abakkus> amen 2 that @lvdoomien
[3:17:03] <+VidyaFranX> But Legion's the one with the (shitty) locker perk
[3:17:11] <Luesagna00> was it siege or something where it had auto bans so baiting was "hello fellow gamers i'm a proud african-american" .
[3:17:12] <$FrostMass22> @Troispoint Sorry, I saw a P and assumed you meant Paige
[3:17:13] <bleugh> Very Cool
[3:17:14] <seriessins> @Troispoint They're friends lol
[3:17:16] <%starotter70> SMRT
[3:17:16] <Vexed_Cassidy> Just randomly throwing racial slurs at someone in a casual game is still a shitty thing to do and I don’t even mind being in hyper-edgy communities
[3:17:19] <%Ell1ot> are you going to play this game on the switch?
[3:17:20] <+Troispoint> Dick and Pat would be too much energy at once
[3:17:22] <KungFuStarfish> Dark souls pvp lol
[3:17:22] <SGrim> Considering the talk of racial slurs, I seem to arrived at peak PeachSaliva streaming. woopsKek
[3:17:28] <$jobbedbone> its all just pixels bro just close your eyes Kappa
[3:17:29] <%Remery_> Yea the amount of times ive found players in closets when I only want to get more Hatchet is crazy because they would jumpscare me xD
[3:17:31] <seriessins> Oh fuck I'm dumb
[3:17:48] <aimlesshealer> @Remery_ EEK! A survivor!
[3:17:48] <LVDoomien> @Luesagna00 yeah they removed that feature b/c false positives so now if you say some shit it'll Not send the message and tell you you just got auto-reported
[3:17:50] <+applemon198> have you tried playing as ash from evil dead yet?
[3:18:03] <Dakuu75> Are they making a sequel to this game? or they still updating and adding content to this one?
[3:18:10] <%Remery_> @aimlesshealer :D
[3:18:18] <+KanjiTatsumi> PogChamp
[3:18:20] <$joylent_blue> paige is so apatBig and STRONK because she has to do all the carrying
[3:18:20] <%fattness132> This game seems like it would have a crazy amount of "bystander effect" with saving people
[3:18:24] <+EySoyCoco> bamboozled
[3:18:29] <+EySoyCoco> nope
[3:18:30] <+MrTurtleThief> monkaS
[3:18:31] <%ElenaManetta> If this game had a Pyramid Head killer, would that be cool or lame
[3:18:34] <copious_koopies> gotcha
[3:18:34] <conflict1914> snu snu time
[3:18:34] <%Ell1ot> oh noes!
[3:18:37] <$FrostMass22> @Dakuu75 Still adding to the original. I don't see a reason to do a sequel seeing as how they do "Games as a service" well
[3:18:38] <Fruitywhompus> aww she just hoists you up
[3:18:40] <+ROBOSAPION6499> @dakuu75 they just added ash from evil dead so they ate still updating it
[3:18:44] <vingadivo> SO CLOSE TO BAMBOOZLE
[3:18:49] <+KanjiTatsumi> vineHard
[3:18:49] <aimlesshealer> The ugly sweater was +10 to stealth
[3:18:51] <$joylent_blue> ElenaManetta it would be both cool and lame
[3:18:56] <%galaxyswirl> that was weird
[3:18:57] <%IAmAkiva> I don't think those two are gonna help.
[3:18:58] <DesuDesuDokiDoki> hmm hmm hmmm hmm hmmmmm
[3:19:01] <$FrostMass22> @ElenaManetta That could be super cool if done right. It would be hard since Pyramid Head is super slow
[3:19:01] <KungFuStarfish> He smelled your good perfume
[3:19:12] <$joylent_blue> but lame in kind of a cool way
[3:19:16] <%Remery_> Milk her!
[3:19:23] <Mr_Strut> Pyramid Head's attack would be an AOE that forces players to use tank controls.
[3:19:23] <%Ell1ot> back to the locker?
[3:19:28] <$FrostMass22> Imagine a Silent Hill map in Dead by Daylight

[3:20:07] <%starotter70> Ma'm, Ma'm please
[3:20:16] <$RaikenTB> But just think of all the women you could kill.
[3:20:20] <%Ell1ot> who's escaping?!
[3:20:20] <$LocDogX86X> they have too have pyramid head super slow though
[3:20:30] <kingbaconcrispy> Play killer. It fits your nature.
[3:20:31] <Dakuu75> huntress is the one that throws axes right?
[3:20:40] <pabloelenano2> huh...crazy thats what i like of playing killer, the pressuer the trill and the mind games
[3:20:41] <$FrostMass22> Maybe Pyramid Head could be faster if he doesn't use the great knife
[3:20:43] <+VidyaFranX> Killer's easier for farming bloodpoints, I feel
[3:20:50] <%IAmAkiva> You didn't like the Lupus killer?
[3:20:51] <LVDoomien> Her throwing axes have to be aimed so there's a bit of skill to it @Mnightshyamallama
[3:20:51] <damienlunas> The killer feels so powerful when you're against them, but then when you're playing the Killer you feel so slow and clumsy
[3:20:52] <%Remery_> All these good Huntress players are making me want to play right now.
[3:20:59] <%starotter70> But Paige loves to kill
[3:21:02] <%CitrusDrink> Have you tried all of them? I didn't like killer at first but then I figured hag out and had a lot of fun with it
[3:21:06] <aimlesshealer> Paige is not a predator, she is a very buff bunny rabbit
[3:21:07] <TwinBat> noice
[3:21:09] <+absolute_cagemony> STRONG AND CAPABLE
[3:21:10] <nmaten> you gotta point it at her face
[3:21:12] <$rdark_ksu> Not. Even. Close
[3:21:14] <+FloorBurger> big dick. lets go...
[3:21:14] <%IAmAkiva> Paige you didn't like the lupus killer after all?
[3:21:15] <+butch_deadlift> what does the flashlight do?
[3:21:18] <+VietcongSamurai> LUL
[3:21:19] <count_bob> *insert cube comments here*
[3:21:19] <%CitrusDrink> Well she tried
[3:21:19] <LVDoomien> LUL LUL LUL LUL
[3:21:21] <+applemon198> paige cant play as killer because she doesnt thirst for the blood of virgins
[3:21:22] <%Remery_> Sick Flip
[3:21:22] <Ion_Laser> :D :D
[3:21:22] <$jobbedbone> but she does predator clicks
[3:21:22] <copious_koopies> ahahaa
[3:21:23] <%ceaselessdiplomacy> F
[3:21:25] <+VidyaFranX> It gets you tunneled
[3:21:27] <conflict1914> flashlight doesn't seem like it does much
[3:21:28] <Ion_Laser> F
[3:21:31] <SGrim> @PeachSaliva have you tried troll-hag? Seems like something you'd enjoy. woopsOwo
[3:21:31] <%starotter70> Back on you go
[3:21:31] <Dakuu75> isn't the flashlight suppose to stun or something? looks like it was doing nothing
[3:21:32] <LVDoomien> that Jane got her fucking block knocked off
[3:21:33] <+MrTurtleThief> F
[3:21:37] <%Ell1ot> she was not phased by that flashlight
[3:21:39] <$joylent_blue> apatGib sacrificed to the blood god apatGib
[3:21:41] <Luesagna00> @peachsaliva on the stairs? ya used the flash at the worst angle XD
[3:21:48] <%CitrusDrink> It can stun but you've gotta keep it on them a while
[3:21:50] <$FrostMass22> How can someone blind blind another?
[3:21:54] <KungFuStarfish> This is like my drunken family Christmas
[3:22:14] <$Sphincter_Spelunker> bleedpurple100 bleedpurple100 bonus20 Hey Paige. Nice cube. K bye Paige
[3:22:24] <anar_bael> I didn't realize you were streaming, man this is really early
[3:22:26] <simulationbard> "Sucking at something is the first step to being sort of good at it" - Jake the dog
[3:22:34] <%Ell1ot> it's the blind blinding the blind
[3:22:39] <SirSmudgey> You should only flashlight a killer when they're stuck in an animation and can't look away
[3:22:42] <$joylent_blue> the P O W E R cube
[3:22:45] <Dakuu75> @simulationbard lol yes. love that quote
[3:22:50] <+jjgamez64> Most people dont get good with flashlight till they practice with friends
[3:23:00] <+KanjiTatsumi> This game is so fascinating, you'd think something like this wouldn't have all of this pre-game stuff
[3:23:00] <count_bob> It's okay Peach!
[3:23:15] <anar_bael> the cube is like a power pack for phones
[3:23:16] <count_bob> We love you and your weird cube based body!
[3:23:18] <%Remery_> better off using Firecrackers if they are still in the game

[3:24:04] <%Ell1ot> take Pat's pants back to your other place and hang it on your fridge

[3:25:37] <conflict1914> what a clod
[3:25:39] <$RaikenTB> Not as hot as Apex's Wraith.
[3:25:40] <aimlesshealer> Claudette you betch
[3:25:42] <%CitrusDrink> At least you didn't end up in the basement
[3:25:47] <+mrshazboto> Paige you seem to have this issue with women in games
[3:25:51] <+StooEsq> Fraudette
[3:25:54] <KungFuStarfish> Cladette the judas
[3:25:55] <%Remery_> Claudette never gets caught because she phases into the backgroundn
[3:25:58] <%dukenux> Claudick
[3:25:59] <seriessins> can confirm, i main claudette and suck at skill checks
[3:26:04] <%CitrusDrink> He has a predator shimmer
[3:26:04] <%nofestu2> You just said it's always 3 separate people
[3:26:12] <$jobbedbone> because its cool
[3:26:15] <Vexed_Cassidy> Blessed with it, invisablessed if you will
[3:26:21] <%galaxyswirl> he isnt technically invisible
[3:26:23] <Mr_Strut> What if you can only stay invisible by ringing the bell?
[3:26:28] <stretch_marx> Nothing Wrong With Bing Bong
[3:26:29] <$RaikenTB> He would be way too good otherwise.

[3:27:00] <%Remery_> Do a Barrel Roll
[3:27:02] <$FrostMass22> I'll try spinning, that's a good trick
[3:27:04] <%galaxyswirl> he is in between realms or something like that
[3:27:04] <+FloorBurger> use the spin, johnny
[3:27:05] <+MechaBaphomet> is there a limit to how many times you can get downed?
[3:27:06] <%dukenux> the rave the had and the old wardrobe/
[3:27:07] <anar_bael> what about the nurse?
[3:27:14] <%dukenux> *hag
[3:27:15] <depressedpepega> F
[3:27:20] <%Ell1ot> phasing between dimensions is like walking into a liquor store. you hear the bing-bong when you walk through thet door
[3:27:26] <seriessins> @MechaBaphomet instant death the third time you get hooked
[3:27:28] <$LocDogX86X> Hows Freddy in this as a killer??
[3:27:28] <$joylent_blue> paige must learn to recognize the golden ratio
[3:27:30] <Mr_Strut> The bell is what makes him invisible.
[3:27:31] <sirrice77> but the bing bong is what makes his power work
[3:27:33] <%CitrusDrink> You can be downed as many times as you want, but you can only be in the downed status for a certain amount of time before you bleed out
[3:27:39] <DesuDesuDokiDoki> LUL
[3:27:39] <depressedpepega> Oh no, now you are also part of the cube
[3:27:40] <Vvvzzzlllvvvzzzlllvvv> "realistically speaking about this magic man"
[3:27:41] <conflict1914> maybe its like, he can't touch things while invisible so he needs to turn it off first
[3:27:42] <nmaten> stream snipe
[3:27:43] <%fattness132> Stream sniping?
[3:27:46] <%Ell1ot> that guy really doesn't like you

[3:27:46] <+KanjiTatsumi> this dude is on your dick
[3:27:49] <KungFuStarfish> He sure is
[3:27:49] <$jobbedbone> Big Ben no BibleThump

[3:27:55] <+mrshazboto> Stream Sniping
[3:27:57] <%Remery_> there's a perk that allows him to see you healing
[3:27:59] <$LocDogX86X> that sucks
[3:27:59] <%galaxyswirl> i find it funny how wraith and nurse have the same power technically @PeachSaliva
[3:28:00] <%Remery_> maybe thats it

[3:28:05] <+ThatOneGameTester> felt like a stream snipe to me
[3:28:10] <+jjgamez64> @PeachSaliva It might be better to get used to running away than spinning in place to dodge
[3:28:15] <sirrice77> binga banga bong he dont wanna leave the jungle no no no no no

[3:28:55] <$joylent_blue> allegedly
[3:29:01] <MarylandJutsu> Pat HEARS then he SEES
[3:29:06] <Dakuu75> can't the killers all track your blood trails or something?
[3:29:14] <aimlesshealer> Time for a training montage!
[3:29:20] <+absolute_cagemony> some good old fashioned whatever-the-fuck...
[3:29:22] <+mrshazboto> "If he would like to join me for some good old fashion fuck, I'd be super down" ~ PeachSaliva
[3:29:22] <LVDoomien> yeh they can follow the trail if you run
[3:29:31] <nmaten> you need to look at them and see when they swing
[3:29:32] <+jjgamez64> No not the spinning, just getting good at using the environment to keep the killer at bay and running away effectively
[3:29:34] <%CitrusDrink> Yeah you leave a blood trail, and also if you sprint it leaves an orange trail for them
[3:29:39] <+jjgamez64> Also using the flashlight
[3:29:48] <@StridentSong> @PeachSaliva We can talk later, but let's talk about your palette tactics
[3:30:20] <$joylent_blue> palette strats
[3:30:24] <Dhurkst> MLG pro tech
[3:30:43] <MarylandJutsu> Worse memeory than a goldfish

[4:02:15] <+jjgamez64> He's sniping
[4:02:17] <Tawbah_> We are doing sooo well - Hard CUT to woolie laughing on stream
[4:02:29] <lemon_lore> 9maybe
[4:02:41] <thecrispyones> LUL
[4:02:41] <GohanEgret> the gauntlet is thrown
[4:02:42] <JumbleJams> it's a standoff
[4:02:48] <%Keyd00d> STREAM FOREVER Clappy
[4:02:50] <Mr_Strut> ALL NIGHT STREAM
[4:02:52] <%kiiiirsten> Just like the donation said you're here foreeeeevur
[4:02:54] <%dukenux> Woolie the killer: attacks with body slam, dread tentacles and drags you to his hole
[4:02:55] <%starotter70> This is the fucking weirdest cold war ever
[4:02:57] <blackbeaking> you'd become the new skelmo
[4:02:57] <$joylent_blue> STREAM FOR-EVER *clap clap clap* STREAM FOR-EVER
[4:03:03] <%Remery_> 24 hour stream?
[4:03:08] <+tuesti> woolie is stream sniping
[4:03:16] <%starotter70> We seent it
[4:03:17] <+FloorBurger> Paige waiting forever for Fry to come back.
[4:03:20] <AccusedPheonix> That how strem works
[4:03:22] <$BioStormX> 24 hour stream
[4:03:23] <+Bane_Kaikyo> yo hattup?
[4:03:24] <%ShaneWhite> What if you misheard Woolie and he said 9 not 8
[4:03:28] <MarylandJutsu> STream FOR EVERRR
[4:03:29] <aimlesshealer> I need to go help cook dinner, Woolie c'mon!
[4:03:36] <blackbeaking> woolie the liar strikes again
[4:03:40] <%dukenux> The cube won't left you leave until there's another streamer
[4:03:42] <TwinBat> BibleThump
[4:03:48] <%starotter70> Woolie, I need to pay my taxes!
[4:03:48] <damienlunas> Just have big sloppy makeouts with Pat until Woolie's stream starts
[4:03:50] <Ion_Laser> so Woolie starts his stream via time travel
[4:03:50] <%Archer2150> You all deserve to die!
[4:03:53] <$Stevennapalm> !uptime
[4:03:54] <simulationbard> Woolie switched to deltarune but he's still not live
[4:03:57] <%Keyd00d> LUL
[4:03:57] <Dhurkst> @FloorBurger Why!? BibleThump
[4:03:58] <energywarning> heal juked
[4:04:00] <%NWR_James> SO MANY POINTS
[4:04:05] <outlawmap> The cube requires a host
[4:04:11] <%dukenux> We could it have it allllllllll
[4:04:12] <+jjgamez64> lol what if its haunted ground
[4:04:13] <shiny_prinny> you were the chosen one!
[4:04:14] <$Dutchpotato> “If it takes forever” BibleThump
[4:04:16] <stabbityrabbit> Why does she have to wait for Woolie to start streaming?
[4:04:17] <Ion_Laser> The Cube requires power
[4:04:19] <%dukenux> *have
[4:04:24] <leprechameleon> he goes to a locker to hide from BBQ n chili
[4:04:27] <GohanEgret> s u c c

[4:04:46] <Dakuu75> "suck my butt" that's some Dean Winchester level of insults lol
[4:04:47] <aimlesshealer> @stabbityrabbit Because the Gamer Cube will consume reality if a streamer is not there to quiet its psychic screams
[4:04:50] <+jjgamez64> Mustve been devorer hope
