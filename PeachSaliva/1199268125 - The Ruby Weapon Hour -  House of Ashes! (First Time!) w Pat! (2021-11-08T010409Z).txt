[1:54:09] <%Sotetsu> Salim has an rpg back, where the weapon just  magnetically sticks to it.
[1:54:20] <RedaiRmex> so much for sword AND shield
[1:54:30] <XenoDandelion> use your big american rifle and shoot your way to a solution
[1:54:31] <dalmek> that piece of rebar has become magnetized thanks to vampire blood
[1:54:31] <+Dakuu75> so, if you failed to lift that, would they stay together?
[1:54:34] <bippityjones> Oh he's got a loop on his backpack belt
[1:54:36] <samTUMZfestival> House of Ash? More like OUNCE OF HASH!Yeeeeeeeee
[1:54:45] <twistedj3ster> they could even be sleeping with Rachel
[1:54:45] <+captain_thickthighs> so wait couldn't they just lift it again then he slides into both on the other side

[1:59:58] <senfood> @GarbageNirvana It's just because he's that very raw, post 9/11 kind of American that doesn't look the best in retrospect.

[2:12:53] <CrowbarFacelift> Sonic
[2:12:54] <+FingaLights> PoroSad
[2:12:54] <PlaidisTheNewPlaid> I can't believe that the stream is over
[2:12:56] <%KingKrampus> only instead of 13 I turned 34 on the 5th
[2:12:59] <%BogBodyPositive> I hope Salim lives
[2:13:13] <%BogBodyPositive> other than that IDC who lives honestly
[2:13:20] <KaitlynnHere> Elmo is big :,( and he is -sniff- strrrroooonnnnggg
[2:13:37] <+pleblu> Jason is meh
[2:13:52] <%BogBodyPositive> Jason is an interesting character choice
[2:14:18] <+FingaLights> Jason is great cause he is easy to hate
[2:14:18] <%CptCreampuff16> gotta give jason respect for still being racist while surrounded by vamps
[2:14:32] <GarbageQueenEllie> I'm okay w Jason living as long as he and Salim become a wacky buddycop team. But only then.
[2:14:35] <%BogBodyPositive> @cptcreampuff16 xD
[2:14:41] <+pleblu> He would do good in true blood
[2:14:51] <+pleblu> damn vampers
[2:14:54] <tank7013> Eric probably has the wildest swings from being cool to a total dickhead
[2:14:58] <%maenos2> sonic he can really move
[2:15:07] <%justicecadet> are all playable chara still alive?
[2:15:09] <SinnerEbru> i still want 500k slow burn enemies to loversjason/salim fanfiction
[2:15:14] <%Ranryu692> I want to take advantage of this break, but I like this cover of the Sonic theme too much LUL
[2:15:19] <%ocelotshotfirst> At least Dar is dead
[2:15:19] <%maenos2> @justicecadet we saw 5 lit candles so maybe
[2:15:20] <tank7013> @justicecadet Possibly?
[2:15:26] <GarbageQueenEllie> @SinnerEbru Yessss bitch
[2:15:28] <%justicecadet> 5 candles, all good
[2:15:28] <%BogBodyPositive> I've met so many people like Jason and I just wonder if they can get better ya knoe
[2:15:48] <Jetsfantasy> I think the whole parasite thing might affect candles. Just a guess though
[2:15:49] <%BogBodyPositive> like, learn every person is the same
[2:15:57] <brachydios777> what's your fav vampire?
[2:16:04] <%CptCreampuff16> i just like asshole characters
[2:16:10] <%BogBodyPositive> no same
[2:16:14] <KaitlynnHere> @brachydios777 sprinkles
[2:16:17] <%CptCreampuff16> more trustworthy
[2:16:24] <+pleblu> Lestat. Hes such an asshole
[2:16:25] <%CappuccinoGuil> God, that scene with Eric and Nick fighting is the fucking best
[2:16:28] <%weapon000> Laszo cravensworth
[2:16:29] <%justicecadet> I'm not sure there is a good ending in which Jason actually reflects or changes as a person
[2:16:30] <+FingaLights> @brachydios777 the 8 foot vampy mommies
[2:16:41] <%BogBodyPositive> but I wonder if people in real life can rehabilitate
[2:16:50] <brachydios777> Do bloodborne hunters count as vamps?
[2:16:51] <%CappuccinoGuil> Casually: "Is that the best you got?" as he gets socked by the weakest punch in history
[2:16:52] <%justicecadet> Eric and Nick is like my least favorite trope. bruh, Nick is clean, your beef is with your wife
[2:16:53] <+pleblu> Only if they want to
[2:16:55] <GarbageQueenEllie> @BogBodyPositive They totally can, but it's a lot of work, and it's ultimately their decision to change that does it.
[2:17:11] <nmaten> of course people can rehabilitate
[2:17:23] <SinnerEbru> @BogBodyPositive it hits people at different points in their life, if at all. you cant make a horse drink yknow
[2:17:26] <tank7013> @CappuccinoGuil That part where Nick said something in a totally normal indoor tone of voice while fistfighting really hit different
[2:17:29] <GarbageQueenEllie> @BogBodyPositive And granted, not a lot of people end up making that choice
[2:17:34] <%maenos2> it has been 5 minutes now
[2:17:35] <nmaten> even questioning human preserverence is taking a discouraging stance
[2:17:44] <+FingaLights> @BogBodyPositive the problem is people are surrounded with liked minded people, so it's kinda though
[2:17:53] <nmaten> be supportive dont take people down,  especially when therye at their most vulnerable
[2:17:57] <%strakillias> strakillias subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 8 months! A couple of things I want to point out about our heroes. 1) Adultery in the military is a subject to dishonorable discharge and up to 1 year in prison. Nick is a criminal. 2) Jason is a Lt. so he had to go to college for 4 yrs and is still this ignorant.
[2:17:59] <%CappuccinoGuil> @tank7013 When I saw it on another channel, I kept looping it over and over, just crying with laughter. The whole scene is gold.
[2:18:01] <%BogBodyPositive> @garbagequeenellie I'm trying to be hopeful
[2:18:12] <Sp3ctre48> That Nick and Eric scene felt like a fever dream
[2:18:12] <%NeoCre> I hope they can unlock the bromance between Jason and Salim
[2:18:13] <%weapon000> empathy is the key.  If they can stop seeing people from them as the other it's possible
[2:18:27] <%W1nterTitan> Did Pat shit his pants?
[2:18:28] <%weapon000> people different from them
[2:18:34] <SinnerEbru> @weapon000 youre fully on the money
[2:18:35] <%MyNameIsRasus> @strakillias you say that as if being college educated is any guarantee of not being stupid
[2:18:45] <GarbageQueenEllie> @BogBodyPositive I prefer to be hopeful too. Which might be why I'm a bit slower to roasting certain shitty character types-- bc I WANT them to change.
[2:18:52] <TheHeroAppears> @W1nterTitan it was the gangstalkers
[2:19:03] <tank7013> @CappuccinoGuil I wouldn't believe the scene was unedited if I hadn't seen it live LUL
[2:19:04] <%BogBodyPositive> @nmaten I wasn't trying to tear down, I just get tired of people being so full of hate towards ultimately what are just other people
[2:19:08] <+mechslayer71> is this the start or the end?
[2:19:14] <+mechslayer71> oh it's a break
[2:19:15] <TheHeroAppears> neither
[2:19:16] <%maenos2> @mechslayer71 neither
[2:19:20] <SinnerEbru> im actually gonna check ao3 if there's a jason/salim fanfic LUL
[2:19:26] <+mechslayer71> yeah just saw the BRB, thanks
[2:19:29] <%superc37> @MyNameIsRasus no it does guarantee that he's old enough to know right from wrong.
[2:19:30] <+A_Real_American_Trash_Can> @SinnerEbru Man that's not even a question probably

[2:22:15] <drunken_lemur> Don't have such Fuckable wives!
[2:22:16] <%AncelDeLambert> I think that depends on HOW you become an officer
[2:22:17] <PlaidisTheNewPlaid> Every officer has to go to college
[2:22:19] <$cgreene64> heck yeah it's a dishonorable discharge
[2:22:20] <TheHeroAppears> The military is all ntr
[2:22:21] <ape_hawk> depends on where he went to college
[2:22:21] <+StrawberryPantsu> MOST Officers are Jackasses.

[2:25:31] <%CappuccinoGuil> @GarbageQueenEllie Military doesn't deserve to get laid
[2:25:31] <%MyNameIsRasus> 1 a day is bad
[2:25:32] <CryoByjorne> Deal\
[2:25:33] <%Explodincatz> no one will
[2:25:34] <%maenos2> I quit monster entirely after the stroke
[2:25:35] <Buttku> it totally is bad
[2:25:36] <LVL1_Scumbag> Like I need your permission
[2:25:36] <hairtoday> volume by weight, pat's probably fine
[2:25:36] <NeonBleu> Is that a promise to all of us?
[2:25:38] <NeroInfinite> 2 isn't recommended.
[2:25:38] <%Gouf_Troop> its pretty bad
[2:25:40] <akitanito> just embalm pat's body in monster
[2:25:41] <samTUMZfestival> Speaking of booba, I'ma check my tinder...
[2:25:41] <%Monkeyweed21> its bad if you do it every day
[2:25:41] <%Ranryu692> coffee sucks
[2:25:41] <%justicecadet> no one controls pat
[2:25:42] <%KeiganOfAstora> That's fair
[2:25:42] <%doomunderthestairs> coffee is betta
[2:25:43] <%Faustgesicht> 5 bangs is rough
[2:25:44] <+CatastropheCorvid> It's terrible for your heart. I know a girl that drank one daily and suffered a heart attack at 22.
[2:25:47] <%KeiganOfAstora> Can't have a toxic relationship
[2:25:49] <%doomunderthestairs> but meh to each their own
[2:25:49] <%king_wragles> More coffee for you
[2:25:50] <ape_hawk> coffee is horrible for you
[2:25:50] <+A_Real_American_Trash_Can> Pat uses Tank controls, not Paige controls.
[2:25:51] <%MyNameIsRasus> it's "you're gonna die at 50" bad
[2:25:51] <eyeobject> The orb demands it
[2:25:51] <%CappuccinoGuil> What if coffee, but brewed with Monster?
[2:25:52] <Blackleafx> pat drinks the smol ones
[2:25:53] <floornine> @ranryu692 NO YOU
[2:25:54] <%NeoCre> It’s a deal
[2:25:55] <%weapon000> what about monster coffee?
[2:25:56] <+The_Protagonist> at least it's not 5 hour energy
[2:25:57] <SinnerEbru> i smoke weed instead of drink caffine
[2:25:57] <%KeiganOfAstora> Milk is gonna make him fall asleep
[2:25:57] <+realm_forge> Introduce espresso
[2:25:59] <%Ranryu692> Pat is so susceptible to Kojima's marketing
[2:25:59] <akitanito> coffee is both bad and good
[2:26:00] <%GarbageNirvana> I mean he probably shouldn't be drinking that much coffee either
[2:26:02] <+FingaLights> Can't handle the orb
[2:26:02] <+mechslayer71> he needs to be big and strong so sit around and play the vidya
[2:26:03] <%ssjklyco> hey he's grump, and you're not so grump
[2:26:04] <MegalomaniacalMegalodon> I've mostly switched to black teas, but I still add a ton of sugar lmao
[2:26:04] <Shwepie> Sounds like you should start controlling Pat.
[2:26:06] <+CandideCamera> I did 4 a day in college and that's why I can literally never have energy drinks anymore
[2:26:09] <+BardicFalanx> Could be worse. He could be drinking BANG
[2:26:11] <floornine> Kinky
[2:26:11] <+Taisuru> ANGRIESTPAT RETURNS
[2:26:12] <%JoshManVGH> I drink DoubleShots, so it's coffee AND Tauriene.
[2:26:14] <akitanito> then just eat caffeine pills
[2:26:15] <+xcompleasedad> So, Pat. How's that house range on the market? Enough to cover a heart bypass?
[2:26:16] <%CappuccinoGuil> Espresso has LESS caffeine than drip coffee
[2:26:17] <%MyNameIsRasus> just don't use drugs 4Head
[2:26:18] <%RayReborne> COMPARED TO MONSTER YEAH JACKASS Kappa

[2:26:40] <%KeiganOfAstora> Espresso is overrated? I never had it
[2:26:42] <+The_Protagonist> YOUR MOVES ARE WEAK, ESPRESSO
[2:26:47] <%SovPho> red bull has 50mg more caffeine than a shot of espresso
[2:26:48] <%Monkeyweed21> you could also stop caffeine

[2:28:13] <%vVAstrAVv> youre mad at his milk and not 2 monsters a day?!?!!!
[2:28:13] <+StrawberryPantsu> @PeachSaliva If Pat loves Milk why is he so Smol?
[2:28:14] <stealthfart> Food wasting in this house
[2:28:15] <%cgreene64> Pat drinks 12 gallons a week
[2:28:16] <Zaphire_Saucypants> milk better for him than Monster
[2:28:16] <$evermoore_hex> Pat will consume the milk with his Bussy
[2:28:18] <floornine> Gief agrees that is too much milk
[2:28:20] <doodledumps> Just chug it all right now
[2:28:21] <SinnerEbru> Paige good housewife

[2:28:22] <GarbageQueenEllie> Paige feed da fam good
[2:28:23] <Khester824> Can you show us the fabled bag of milk?
[2:28:24] <%BlackMage66652> MILK IS HOW HE GREW TO HIT THE BACK
[2:28:24] <+Logoth_> remember when pat went to the gym
[2:28:25] <%cooldude69xx> Paige is the only reason Pat is alive
[2:28:27] <mr_saturday93> gotta keep the orb in shape
[2:28:27] <+Violentbootys> He needs it to grow big and strong
[2:28:28] <Buttku> he's dying tho
[2:28:29] <+realm_forge> BABY PAT NEEDS HIS MILKIES
[2:28:30] <Blank9> milk sucks because it gives me the shits and has a lot of calories for a drink
[2:28:32] <$SvenHolgersson> Pat enables himself
[2:28:34] <%Reaped_Psyche> He's just trying to die and become the skeleton he knows you want him to be.
[2:28:34] <DXLelouch24> @PeachSaliva you dumpster dive you dont get top tell ANYONE whats healthy
[2:28:34] <+TEANTACLES> HEY PAT WHERE'S YOUR CHOCOLATE
[2:28:34] <+dethsenvoy01> I almost got court marshaled over keys in okinawa
[2:28:34] <$SvenHolgersson> How dare
[2:28:38] <+TEANTACLES> WHERE'S YOUR CANDY PAT
[2:28:40] <senfood> Paige, steal the Cum Chalice and the Orb, like Indiana Jones.
[2:28:42] <Mister_McDerp> Paige should get a leash for Pat
[2:28:43] <%SveriSageAdvice> lmfao, its their fault for thinking a significant other is supposed to control what someone is supposed to do
[2:28:43] <%MyNameIsRasus> Does milk in Canada also have sugar like weird American milk?
[2:28:45] <akitanito> it's all relative
[2:28:50] <+The_Protagonist> a little salami
[2:28:50] <PlaidisTheNewPlaid> I can't believe that Paige allows Pat to make decisions.
[2:28:51] <HaroldDonchee> one spoonful
[2:28:51] <%JoshManVGH> Couch Candy
[2:28:52] <+Rofiarf> paige offended at the prospect she doesnt enable pat
[2:28:54] <AXL808> milk is like the least offensive habit/addiction Pat can have
[2:28:54] <N0N0TTHEBEES> Pat shakes the milk bag
[2:28:54] <samTUMZfestival> Little = giant Bunny
[2:28:56] <%SilverJakler> I need to cut back on soda
[2:28:57] <%CappuccinoGuil> A whole cake for Pat, as a treat
[2:28:59] <@Jekado> a bag is a "Little" candy
[2:28:59] <floornine> Pat drinks his milk to try in vain to grow taller
[2:28:59] <%ssjklyco> Paige, you're sitting on the candy hiding spot now
[2:29:00] <NeonBleu> little candy = half the jar
[2:29:00] <%c4llmesnuggles> hows it going
[2:29:02] <+The_Protagonist> Pat can have a little salami, as a treat
[2:29:02] <%SilverJakler> I have a glass a day usually
[2:29:02] <+Sadira_snack_attack> just beat him
[2:29:03] <tank7013> "No I'm a cool mom I swear"
[2:29:04] <%RayReborne> say "ok you have candy" but give him gum
[2:29:05] <CatRidder> woolieis the one who enables pat
[2:29:06] <Broand> Becareful paige he may have hidden milk in the couch
[2:29:10] <%Bigchill___> 1 jumbo bar is still just 1 piece of candy.
[2:29:10] <NeroInfinite> His idea of alittle candy is hiding full bars in the couch. LUL

[2:45:18] <valentinostand> Peach Pro NTR
[2:45:18] <%c4llmesnuggles> simp
[2:45:19] <%NeoCre> You kept boosting their relationship Paige
[2:45:19] <bob900000> it's a video game
[2:45:20] <AXL808> you told her you love her still!
[2:45:22] <+JusTTheGuyYouNeed> At least this has open the way for the Salim rout
[2:45:22] <ohno778> Paige wanted the gay end
[2:45:22] <%polothegreatest> She s confused too
[2:45:22] <%CptCreampuff16> you kept saying you loved her
[2:45:23] <$chance_h> The game cucked us of a normal dialogue
[2:45:23] <tigerfang86> SHE MADE OUT WITH NICK
[2:45:24] <DracaenaLeaf> video games
[2:45:25] <jorniev> CUTTING THE ROPE DOESNT COUNT I GUESS
[2:45:25] <%doomunderthestairs> damn I thought she was dead in the first plave
[2:45:25] <%justicecadet> that made no sense
[2:45:26] <LVL1_Scumbag> In another month she'll switch back over again
[2:45:26] <+Mr_Pylon> It's super not enough, but it is for a game!
[2:45:27] <Zaphire_Saucypants> I agree
[2:45:27] <%JoshManVGH> @peachsaliva She thought cutting the rope was super hot
[2:45:28] <deviljhojho_> the romance is most def the weakest part
[2:45:28] <%doomunderthestairs> place
[2:45:29] <jfp4life> Eric said "I Love you", it's the ultimate power move toward the women
[2:45:30] <%G_Thunders> Pat raised it too much
[2:45:30] <%CptCreampuff16> shoulda sent her to the streets
[2:45:31] <koffeemancer> Pat made eric go up too much
[2:45:31] <%FingaLights> Swing Queen
[2:45:31] <+captain_thickthighs> This just proves women shouldn't be in the army

[2:45:32] <Profmcstevie> YOU GIVE EM ENOUGH OF THE EYEBROWS, THEY WANNA TRY AGAIN
[2:45:33] <sendart> vidya game logic
[2:45:33] <matsu_me> you did this
[2:45:33] <%ssjklyco> Eric gets a free cheat now
[2:45:33] <%generalve> you kept making romantic dialogue choices as Eric
[2:45:34] <%Puhff> these4 game mechanics suck shit
[2:45:34] <Daxalog> You raised the relationship REALLY High
[2:45:34] <%Agami23> it feels like they forced romance in just for the drama
[2:45:34] <+RustyCoyoteA> this feels shoehorned in
[2:45:34] <$Dutchpotato> She was just smooching the other guy
[2:45:35] <+Taisuru> SHOW DOG
[2:45:35] <+Whiskey_T_Foxtrot> maybe they're just bad people
[2:45:37] <HalloweenHangover> Pat is too good at relationship counseling.
[2:45:38] <Srthunda> she made out with nick then told him to fuck off
[2:45:38] <%ClericOfSparda> The uncuckening
[2:45:38] <Mister_McDerp> ERIC AND NICK SHOULD GET TOGETHER
[2:45:40] <%AncelDeLambert> Salim is the only reason this game is good
[2:45:40] <%c4llmesnuggles> men dont show emotions
[2:45:43] <%CappuccinoGuil> @PeachSaliva You guys chose positive, flirting options when they were together. In your defense, this is REALLY not written well.

[2:45:47] <%justicecadet> she needs to self reflect
[2:45:48] <eyeobject> You cut that rope super hot babe
[2:45:49] <%Monkeyweed21> @PeachSaliva YOU PICKED ALL THE CHOICES THAT WERE MAKE UP AND KISS
[2:45:50] <Prevot> Pat is too good at fixing relationships
[2:45:50] <+chiazam> @PeachSaliva If you pick all the nice options between the two she auto goes back to him
[2:45:50] <+jinking79> Love is Cocaine u find a way back to it
[2:45:51] <%strakillias> She need to be dumped hard

[2:45:58] <AXL808> she's infected she's a goner anyway!
[2:46:00] <%Ranryu692> so she should sleep with a therapist?
[2:46:00] <senfood> She needs to be single. And they need to get better lovers.
[2:46:00] <Aleate> And fuck the therapist
[2:46:01] <%Sotetsu> Just keep drinking your laundry detergent, Paige.
[2:46:01] <valentinostand> Peach is NTR Goddess
[2:46:01] <ergulor> and a veterinarain
[2:46:01] <+CatastropheCorvid> THE UNCUCKENING
[2:46:01] <leinadtonu> She was kissing the other dude 5 minutes before.
[2:46:02] <Badgerconda_> she needs to fuck a therapist behind Eric's back
[2:46:03] <stantheman_97> fuck
[2:46:04] <%SilvaChariot0133> so she can fuck the therapist?
[2:46:04] <+Whiskey_T_Foxtrot> literally all of them do, you see the shit they're dealing with?

[2:46:10] <+Lizard0TM> Paige angry she didn't get to kill Rachel
[2:46:10] <susukouhai> those 2 need better standards
[2:46:10] <The_Murray_Carp> shouldn't have chosen the fuck options
[2:46:11] <%MyNameIsRasus> The hobby being having gay sex together
[2:46:11] <Phorathic> There is a possibility that she dumps both of them there. It's great
[2:46:12] <zettig> then she can start boinking the therapist
[2:46:14] <%Dumple_Roe> everyone but Salem
[2:46:14] <tigerfang86> Press 1 in chat if you support NICKxERIC
[2:46:14] <+lowquality1234> Now time for Eric to die.
[2:46:16] <Senselessvirus> Paige you literally kept choosing the nice guy options because you didn't want to be mean. you basically strung Nick along.
[2:46:17] <SinnerEbru> geifey?

[3:00:34] <HalloweenHangover> Salim opened up to you and you had a chance to open up to him about accidentally killing a woman in a checkpoint with Nick.
[3:00:35] <+Lizard0TM> The Checkpoint is where they shot an innocent woman
[3:00:35] <TheHeroAppears> they referenced earlier that him and nick shot a lady
[3:00:35] <Nekros4442> The Checkpoint is where Jason and the other soldier shot the woman
[3:00:35] <Aleate> They've said it so many times
[3:00:35] <+wynnewake> The two options were either for Jason to admit he has regrets about the checkpoint incident where Nick shot somebody at his command, or change the subject
[3:00:36] <KaitlynnHere> keep looking at me! I felt that
[3:00:36] <Lorsagne> The checkpoint where he and Nick shot an innocent woman.

[3:02:04] <%BlackMage66652> BABA IS THE HOUSE OF ASHES

[3:02:13] <+TEANTACLES> @PeachSaliva paige you need to go into the accessibility settings and turn on longer timers for dialogue
[3:02:14] <%Sotetsu> Maybe they are starving and crazy.
[3:02:14] <%justicecadet> wtf indeed
[3:02:15] <%ocelotshotfirst> This is what we're here for Paige
[3:02:17] <%Faustgesicht> :)
[3:02:18] <Mister_McDerp> OR ARE THEY?
[3:02:18] <$Niney_Who> Either they're an alien Sickness or an alien's *pet*
[3:02:19] <akitanito> maybe the original aliens all died out
[3:02:19] <Arweynn> House of BABA
[3:02:20] <VritraReiRei> Wait, wait, wait, everyone one of these games has a plot twist. Until Dawn, Man of Medan, Little Hope... what kind of plot twist left could there be!? we already have Vampire Aliens!!
[3:02:20] <toyforus235> distinct 9
[3:02:20] <%slimmixrp> All will be revealed
[3:02:21] <%weapon000> Alien zoo
[3:02:21] <+MidnightBurst12> they got the brain rot?
[3:02:21] <SinnerEbru> @KeiganOfAstora prolly a 70/30 deal
[3:02:21] <Zaphire_Saucypants> There's more to it
[3:02:22] <%justicecadet> yeah Giger!!!
[3:02:22] <%AncelDeLambert> maybe they're pets. Or shocktroops
[3:02:23] <Parapattern> That woman queen was
[3:02:25] <KLouDraws> maybe thats what regular human ghoul is for?
[3:02:25] <AngryAsian5> Look at this Aliens shit
[3:02:25] <scrambledxeggz> I'm big proud of Paige today lol
[3:02:26] <%polothegreatest> Workers pat
[3:02:26] <%ssjklyco> how long until we see a lab
[3:02:27] <%greasypete00> it seems like maybe a falmer/dwemer situation?
[3:02:27] <brachydios777> Seems like a temple
[3:02:28] <$Dutchpotato> That’s what I said, how do these mindless creatures pilot a space ship
[3:02:29] <Admiral_PopnFresh> this is just fucking Aliens
[3:02:30] <+BoboDaHobo> maybe don't play with your dog during emotional scenes
[3:02:30] <Daebunz> yeah you can adjust a lot of stuff
[3:02:31] <Baljhet> check out that bootleg Geiger architecture
[3:02:32] <tjkillemup2> maybe they are a alien bioweapon
[3:02:33] <Dunmarkh> Try?
[3:02:33] <DXLelouch24> Paige your ADHD is someone worse than mine was and thats impressive.Hopefully one day you too can conquer yours.
[3:02:34] <%Garthunox> cant wait to see paige to eventually get to Sastasha
[3:02:34] <zerointelligence000> are the vampires alien wmd's?
[3:02:34] <iswearimjustdandy> Adhd is feeling physically your brain jettisoning information out your ears
[3:02:35] <+TEANTACLES> iirc yes it's an option
[3:02:36] <Daebunz> for the time sensitive gameplay
[3:02:36] <$SvenHolgersson> PROMETHEUS
[3:02:36] <TheBigPutty> maybe the women vampires are
[3:02:37] <+ReallyBigRocks> :O
[3:02:37] <Prevot> maybe aliens were killed by vampires and brought vampire mold here
[3:02:37] <%AncelDeLambert> WATCH YOUR STEP, JACKASS
[3:02:37] <+DakotaMacDoodle> Bio Weapons!
[3:02:38] <%strakillias> Oh my god this is the beginning of Alien
[3:02:38] <tigerfang86> oh no DEATH SPORES

[3:02:38] <eyeobject> But then if Baba...then Salim ceases to be!
[3:02:39] <+Lizard0TM> pretty
[3:02:39] <StebTheVee> aliens are extinct/ these are infected
[3:02:39] <akitanito> pop crackers
[3:02:40] <%FingaLights> Oh no
[3:02:43] <RedaiRmex> these creatures ate the aliens i bet
[3:02:44] <senfood> IT'S YELLOW CAKE
[3:02:46] <+Rellim80> Yup
[3:02:47] <Daebunz> you can also toggle hold instead of mash
[3:02:48] <afronooch> oh no
[3:02:48] <%BlackMage66652> BABA IS YOU, PAIGE
[3:02:48] <$evermoore_hex> those 4000 year old dudes dont seem like they can operate machinery now either
[3:02:49] <+Bogart4321> paige goes bbgbbrrrppp

[3:02:51] <%Agami23> i hope they are run by a mindflayer
[3:02:55] <deviljhojho_> stay frosty crikCool
[3:02:57] <Zaphire_Saucypants> You should definitely focus
[3:02:58] <Coystick> Dass cool
[3:02:59] <%Ranryu692> is this just Prometheus
[3:02:59] <$Dutchpotato> Just pause if you need the extra time
[3:02:59] <StebTheVee> there's the WMDs
[3:03:01] <samTUMZfestival> You just FORGET
[3:03:02] <%BogBodyPositive> were here to watch you play however you play, don't worry!
[3:03:03] <TheHeroAppears> @Daebunz they had it for little hope and it did not work
[3:03:06] <%doomunderthestairs> it happens no biggie
[3:03:07] <%MyNameIsRasus> That makes sense
[3:03:07] <SGrim> Sometimes you just forget
[3:03:07] <RedaiRmex> thats why humans look different than the ones that are swarminh
[3:03:11] <$evermoore_hex> sometimes her adhd says no adderall
[3:03:12] <%c4llmesnuggles> take half pill
[3:03:12] <deviljhojho_> i mean i guess it counts as a WMD
[3:03:12] <JetpackMcQuack> <3 the stream is good
[3:03:13] <Baljhet> people saying "just focus" cannot understand how this shit works
[3:03:14] <+MidnightBurst12> don't worry about it
[3:03:14] <+lowquality1234> I think you can turn the timer off
[3:03:15] <Treasure_Vault> Just take a tic tac and pretend it's an adderall
[3:03:15] <afronooch> Dubya was right
[3:03:15] <%KeiganOfAstora> No I don't understand that but ok
[3:03:16] <Daebunz> @TheHeroAppears oh really, thats a bummer if its still broken
[3:03:16] <+DatAsuna> being in chat is basically being a doctor
[3:03:17] <%justicecadet> i just want this as a movie
[3:03:17] <KaseKaizer> KKona
[3:03:18] <Jaxnos> i would count this as a WMD, yes
[3:03:18] <matsu_me> MISSION ACCOMPLISHED
[3:03:19] <%doomunderthestairs> we will get through the struggle together
[3:03:20] <samTUMZfestival> WE LOVE YOU PAIGE

[3:03:25] <samTUMZfestival> WE LOVE YOOU
[3:03:26] <%MechArch> wappy
[3:03:26] <deviljhojho_> we cant ask streamers to fuck themselves up to create content
[3:03:28] <Mister_McDerp> the aliens were the WMDS all along
[3:03:28] <%c4llmesnuggles> ahhhhhhh
[3:03:29] <$SvenHolgersson> We love you Paige never doubt it
[3:03:30] <+RabbiKing> More than just focus, you'll have to be able to recall information from hours ago (specifically last session for you) to maintain context
[3:03:30] <%c4llmesnuggles> ok
[3:03:31] <Aleate> This has been a good stream. Just no one in chat bring up the Rug Kappa
[3:03:32] <Zeif00> The ones with the balls?
[3:03:32] <tjkillemup2> don't worry it's just more content lol
[3:03:32] <$RealThiele> oh long release
[3:03:34] <HaroldDonchee> aw fuck. what if these are wmds that escaped
[3:03:39] <KaironFortressKnight> Salim is the WMD
[3:03:41] <Admiral_PopnFresh> like fucking Necrons
[3:03:41] <%Nkbzodiac> WMDeez nutz
[3:03:41] <%Sotetsu> If you do get distracted or confused, it's cool if you pause it. fmgNICE
[3:03:42] <floornine> Take a 1/4 of it
[3:03:46] <%FingaLights> Sometimes I just forget to take it in the morning, then I'm like, welp, not today
[3:03:46] <+DatAsuna> Fucking stop trying to give her medical advice over twitch lol
[3:03:51] <+TEANTACLES> paige does adderall work better than ritalin in your opinion? I'm on ritalin and it's not great
[3:03:51] <+ThomasOfTroy> You don't get some lower dose IR to take as needed?
[3:03:52] <%c4llmesnuggles> its good for content though lol\
[3:03:54] <%Bane_Kaikyo> How is paige perscribed something that's NOT take daily?
[3:03:54] <+Emperor_Machinus> then they find the Marker
[3:03:55] <Dunmarkh> yes
[3:03:57] <%KeiganOfAstora> I'm not used to medications, if you know you have to take it a certain way why not just do that then? You knew you were gonna stram days in advance. Take care of yourself Paige >3
[3:03:57] <%BlackMage66652> @PeachSaliva I'm here for the scuff, I just feel bad you got so worried about it.
[3:03:58] <%MyNameIsRasus> I think you played Jason as not a racist enough so that you're in the clear
[3:03:59] <jorniev> WE WENT FULL ETERNAL DARKNESS
[3:03:59] <%KeiganOfAstora> <3
[3:04:00] <scrambledxeggz> It's ok paige!!!! <3
[3:04:03] <+storebrandcandy> Reverse the polarity
[3:04:08] <iswearimjustdandy> Who said take half a pill, thats the dumest shit ever to say to someone who regularly takes meds
[3:04:08] <%BinaryFireball> you good paige, chat was being ass
[3:04:09] <+CatastropheCorvid> Can we just make chat emote only to keep the people who don't understand ADHD from whining?
[3:04:10] <%justicecadet> no worries
[3:04:11] <+JustToWatch> @PeachSaliva remember the longer dialogue option
[3:04:13] <KaseKaizer> D:
[3:04:13] <Jaxnos> we're about to go full blown independence day, please tell me we're about to get full independence day
[3:04:13] <LLCoolZJ> jesus fish
[3:04:13] <emoonimoo> <3
[3:04:14] <samTUMZfestival> Don't worry about it, Paige.
[3:04:14] <deviljhojho_> This is your brain. This is your brain on (no) drugs
[3:04:14] <%MyNameIsRasus> <3
[3:04:15] <%c4llmesnuggles> snowballs away from ya
[3:04:18] <+gitgouda> it was fun
[3:04:20] <%Sotetsu> This area is so cool.
[3:04:20] <Stevie0g> Only take 99/100 of the pill, should be good :)
[3:04:24] <%BogBodyPositive> @CatastropheCorvid agreed
[3:04:25] <%Agami23> the man typing the typewriter that is paiges thoughts is just mashing all the keys
[3:04:29] <RedaiRmex> aaaaaaaaaalien

[3:04:36] <+chiazam> Oh fuck are they aliens
[3:04:36] <eduwardovich> There was an attempt to Paige
[3:04:39] <%justicecadet> those chairs are rad
[3:04:42] <deviljhojho_> you can watch that scene after the LP is done anyways
[3:04:42] <%FingaLights> She becomes a ... "Blank Paige"
[3:04:43] <%BlackMage66652> BABA is vampire
[3:04:45] <+Rofiarf> was it a statue?
[3:04:56] <+Rellim80> Yup
[3:04:58] <senfood> @PeachSaliva What you described is exactly how I feel when more than one person talks to me at the same time.
[3:04:59] <%Sotetsu> Can you get a good look at the chairs?
[3:05:01] <%maenos2> people being all "it wasn't clear," guys it's Iraq, what else could checkpoint POSSIBLY refer to?
[3:05:01] <jerree66> Don't think those are statues
[3:05:04] <Baljhet> mmhmm, unfortunately we remember Prometheus
[3:05:05] <PlaidisTheNewPlaid> It was a fossil I thought?
[3:05:08] <samTUMZfestival> SPAWKLE
[3:05:09] <%LeiaSkynoober> @KeiganOfAstora Forgetfulness happens, it's apart of ADHD. Plus if I wake up after say, 10am, I can't take my adderall otherwise I'll be anxious for a while
[3:05:10] <Aleate> "Statue" Kappa
[3:05:11] <akitanito> long hauler
[3:05:12] <%Agami23> dont forget you can aim your flashlight
[3:05:14] <+TEANTACLES> @senfood as someone with adhd: you might have adhd
[3:05:14] <%BlackMage66652> Wait, are these things actually aliens?
[3:05:15] <vonmaultke> it could just be in status Pat
[3:05:20] <+other_badger> he doesn't know that
[3:05:20] <%generalve> GO LEFT
[3:05:20] <%cobalt_phoenix_> MOSS
[3:05:24] <Coystick> The Alien eggs in the Derelict were either cargo or ammo, and it's GREAT they never tell you exactly
[3:05:27] <Mister_McDerp> GO LEFT
[3:05:29] <%Sotetsu> Do you see the dead vampires in the chairs?
[3:05:31] <kingbaconcrispy> Didnt know about the adhd. Missed some of the lore. I trained someone in boxing who had that.  Quite the challenge
[3:05:34] <%c4llmesnuggles> left
[3:05:34] <+zarkazeon> isn't it impossible to go more than like 2000 ft underground?
[3:05:36] <samTUMZfestival> How tight is your hat?

[3:17:13] <%Sotetsu> Maybe turning into a vampire is the alien equivilent of the common cold.
[3:17:14] <samTUMZfestival> Use it like a puppet.

[3:33:34] <+TEANTACLES> for no reason whatsoever, reminder than you can do nothing in more than just dialogue...

[3:47:08] <%Kevlar_Caviar> @strakillias well these things will certainly cause mass destruction if they get out lmao
[3:47:09] <Baljhet> paige stop peeling back the curtain
[3:47:10] <Aussie_Manny> NICK, NO! WE LIKE YOU! D:
[3:47:11] <$RC_S3kshun8> Jason & Salim as bash brothers was absolutely my favourite aspect of this game.
[3:47:12] <%CptCreampuff16> the dynamite is a dud!!!!!
[3:47:12] <Zaphire_Saucypants> No man left behind.
[3:47:12] <%SveriSageAdvice> oh, this is totally where the fire scene is going to come up isnt it
[3:47:16] <AXL808> that 2nd group of soldiers got wrecked easily. i don't think air support matters
[3:47:17] <tigerfang86> No nick you're cool
[3:47:18] <tanarath> @pendragwn paige forced them to not bring it
[3:47:19] <+Lizard0TM> military is going in if they don't respond in 24 hours, so rescuers will arrive no matter what
[3:47:20] <+xcompleasedad> @SveriSageAdvice YES
[3:47:22] <%CptCreampuff16> it said so in the document
[3:47:24] <Dementedpenguin> Not gonna lie, this is the weirdest fucking "War on Terror" game I've ever seen.
[3:47:26] <%TimberWulfe> So in order thus far: Chemical induced hallucinations; Demons manifested from horrific trauma; Alien Parasites
[3:47:29] <LLCoolZJ> nick got cukced might as well not care about blowing up
[3:47:33] <+xcompleasedad> @PeachSaliva This QTE will ACTUALLY kill him

[3:53:10] <Zaphire_Saucypants> still a shame about that checkpoint.
[3:53:13] <%weapon000> Zangief charged up his super the piss cannon
[3:53:14] <%CryoByjorne> Cross the streams!

[3:53:24] <%CappuccinoGuil> Shake those fingers, loosen up
[3:53:24] <%Sotetsu> You're doing great :D
[3:53:24] <DuoScratch> @PeachSaliva you're doing really well, if it helps. I've watched a couple of streams of this now, and by now other streamers have fucked up them heartbeats.
[3:53:27] <sirrice77> alright do i just misunderstand how echolocation works? I thought the way it works is they make noise and use the reverb of the noises bouncing off of objects to know where things are. So you don't actually need to make noise to be seen by echolocation, though i suppose if you arent moving they might mistake you for an object?
[3:53:29] <+A_Real_American_Trash_Can> You're doing good though!
[3:53:30] <DashXero> You got this.
[3:53:30] <+NiktenKing> TENSION IS KILLING ME
[3:53:32] <hotglocklate> people talk about how spoilers ruin games but watching you guys play it has made me want to buy this like, now
[3:53:32] <+meattube1> watch out for button switches @PeachSaliva
[3:53:32] <+TEANTACLES> i'm not sure but i think if there's another, it might be 2 at a time, be ready
[3:53:35] <$evermoore_hex> SO much better than little hope
[3:53:35] <%Monkeyweed21> @PeachSaliva remember, Nick died to the vampire in a place surrounded by fire
[3:53:36] <+Taisuru> Don't give up skeleton
[3:53:38] <EntropyArcade> im pretty sure on this next check it changes from X to 'Triangle' abruptly @PeachSaliva
[3:53:38] <Aussie_Manny> uuuuuuuughhhhhhhh
[3:53:42] <KingKZ> DBD skill checks are assumes.
[3:53:43] <scrambledxeggz> YOURE DOING SO WELL!!!
[3:53:45] <%Sotetsu> Really glad baby mode is a thing.
[3:53:50] <EntropyArcade> idk about difficulty difference
[3:53:51] <Sol_Install> it's fine
[3:53:51] <%NeoCre> Be prepared for the Y variant just in case
[3:53:53] <+storebrandcandy> Check out how hard gief can pee
[3:53:54] <brachydios777> That's fine
[3:53:55] <Sol_Install> still fine
[3:53:55] <Baljhet> @sirrice77 I assume they have no recent knowledge of the terrain since they were sleeping, so...that one.
[3:53:56] <+RojanBo> Make sure you only press X once when you hit continue so you don't accidentally trigger it
[3:53:56] <Mnemonic_Mission> you guys have done a great job still
[3:53:57] <%evbites> @sirrice77 yeah it's just reguler hearing at that point
[3:53:57] <+Whiskey_T_Foxtrot> ain't nothing wrong with that
[3:53:58] <Aussie_Manny> BabyRage
[3:53:59] <Admiral_PopnFresh> She's baby LUL
[3:53:59] <+bread_assassin> Paige, you beat Bloodborne. You can press buttons with very generous timing.
[3:54:06] <%CappuccinoGuil> If it helps, you already helped Nick
[3:54:11] <Gloppie> @sirrice77 You are correct, but movie echolocation works on "can only hear sound" rules
[3:54:12] <RedaiRmex> truuuuu
[3:54:13] <Aussie_Manny> be prepared for the Delta variant
[3:54:14] <%Reaped_Psyche> Who wants to bet that the human vampire is going to save him.
[3:54:20] <emil_hunter1> I think QTE difficulty was a good idea
[3:54:20] <GrizzMango> aren't you so hyped that it turned out to be aliens?
[3:54:20] <Aleate> Bloodborne was amazing
[3:54:20] <hotglocklate> man this game looks fucking awesome
[3:54:23] <+A_Real_American_Trash_Can> I believe Paige!

[4:31:55] <Blackleafx> @PeachSaliva No that was a mistake, I miswrote
[4:31:55] <%Agami23> little hope was just a dude having a hallucinations. not much to write in
[4:31:55] <%G_Thunders> Winterhold wouldve been the miners from Until Dawn, since this takes place in 2003

[4:34:21] <iswearimjustdandy> Salim got out scot free, like he deserved
[4:34:22] <Blackleafx> Hey Paige I miswrote earlier, Winterfold isn't where Until Dawn takes place

[4:34:23] <+TopTieramisu> D U N E
[4:34:24] <+Taisuru> NOW IT IS TIME FOR PAT ASS REVEAL
[4:34:24] <+MidnightBurst12> good job
[4:34:25] <%Monkeyweed21> the best ending where only 4 out of 5 characters get Epstein'd
[4:34:29] <Sol_Install> This was the BEST of the 3 tbh right now
[4:34:29] <%Sotetsu> Thanks for streaming that. fmgLOVE
[4:34:31] <%polothegreatest> sipsipElmo sipsipElmo
[4:34:31] <BurdRightsActivist> PAT ASS REVEAL??
[4:34:31] <+zamatermort> emlo
[4:34:31] <Dapper_Cactuar> so much better than little hope huh
[4:34:33] <tanarath> baby
[4:34:34] <%cgreene64> 1st try!
[4:34:37] <DashXero> But were the rest of them executed?
[4:34:37] <SinnerEbru> he with his son UwU
[4:34:38] <%CptCreampuff16> Jason and Salim roomates ending confirmed?
[4:34:39] <%c4llmesnuggles> go back to his boy
[4:34:42] <missingangle> Salim's okay, that's all that matters
[4:34:42] <%FingaLights> Best boi got away
[4:34:42] <scrambledxeggz> That was so good!
[4:34:45] <Baljhet> also now Salim is a rogue element who knows what happened and isn't owned by the US government
[4:34:46] <KaitlynnHere> It’s also a dune reference
[4:34:47] <CanadianAnimatorGuy> Little Hope a shit
[4:34:47] <$RealThiele> Selim needs to be pulled into SCP foundation
[4:34:47] <AngryAsian5> When's Salim's sequel? I wanna see that dude tear more shit up.
[4:34:48] <bear_breaker20> his sons in britain tho...
[4:34:48] <deviljhojho_> this was straight up solid
[4:34:49] <drunken_lemur> You know, after Little Hope, I was hoping that Dark Pictures would end with the next game, but fuck it, I hope Season 2 is as good as this.
[4:34:51] <Sol_Install> yea
[4:34:52] <+pupil31> LUL
[4:34:55] <%evbites> wtf were they thinking with little hope
[4:34:57] <+MidnightBurst12> rip everyone else tho
[4:34:57] <deviljhojho_> yeah i'd probably agree
[4:34:58] <Zaphire_Saucypants> Really good, yeah.
[4:34:59] <StebTheVee> 2nd place
[4:35:00] <Profmcstevie> The quality of the dark pictures thus far is a fucking rollercoaster
[4:35:00] <senfood> Really close second.
[4:35:01] <+Taisuru> Salim needs his own game
[4:35:01] <%KingKrampus> thank you guys so much for streaming this, I loved this
[4:35:03] <+sjay662> Until Dawn is more polished and had more Money behind it
[4:35:03] <%ssjklyco> They literally had to hold out Until Dawn
[4:35:04] <luftraumm1> @toptieramisu ya boy leto II knows about a golden path
[4:35:04] <$thomassolorio> p.p
[4:35:04] <evermoore_hex> so canonically vampires AND wendigoes are real
[4:35:05] <%BlackMage66652> @PeachSaliva Is this series worth playing?
[4:35:05] <+Cafftac> Winterfold is a location on the map in Zain's room WAAAAAY in the beginning
[4:35:05] <Sol_Install> until dawn, house of ashes, then whatever the fuck after that
[4:35:07] <missingangle> easy second place
[4:35:11] <$Dutchpotato> There was some dumb stuff but overall good
[4:35:11] <%Monkeyweed21> That finale was just the end of Tower of Conviction from Berserk
[4:35:11] <%RayReborne> until dawn waa what, 15-20 hours?
[4:35:13] <Hilljoy> I liked it
[4:35:14] <+Mr_Pylon> Salim best character
[4:35:18] <Shwepie> What were the vampires?
[4:35:19] <%RayReborne> idfk
[4:35:20] <%Reaped_Psyche> @Blackleafx Confirmed.  I posted a link in the Discord that explains a bit of it as well.
[4:35:20] <SchroedingersFerret> Until Dawn had Rami and Peter Stormare
[4:35:24] <tigerfang86> They made an amazing action movie
[4:35:24] <Aussie_Manny> This was GREAT
[4:35:28] <Mister_McDerp> I love the twist thats its 2 aliens instead of one
[4:35:30] <bob900000> didn't sony publish until dawn?
[4:35:32] <%FingaLights> the big good
[4:35:33] <$thomassolorio> ply back 4 blood next
[4:35:36] <deviljhojho_> you guys really showed clarice tho
[4:35:37] <%G_Thunders> @shwepie Aliens infected with some parasite that got on their ship
[4:35:38] <%hrbeck_> There’s still questions but they are interesting
[4:35:39] <$StaceMcGate> PET ELMO
[4:35:39] <Aussie_Manny> Good job, Supermassive! Good job, Elmo!
[4:35:41] <+furiousfurioso> there was some weird writing and parts where they clearly ran out of money, but the overall adventure was FUN
[4:35:42] <+TEANTACLES> i hope until dawn gets a pc port
[4:35:43] <AvroEltz> i mean, they couldve taken the money from little hope and put on this one
[4:35:45] <+Taisuru> PET GRANDPA
[4:35:46] <tigerfang86> the relationship stuff is weird but that's how story games go tbh
[4:35:47] <Zaphire_Saucypants> Yeah, video games bein video games.
[4:35:49] <%FingaLights> Elmo demands pets
[4:35:49] <djgrouphug> oh he reach
[4:35:50] <+DatAsuna> the online play kinda fucks up the characterisation witht he weird bipolar scenes
[4:35:51] <+sjay662> Until Dawn was made using Decima (Horizon and Death Stranding engine) DPA uses Unreal
[4:35:52] <tigerfang86> ehhhh
[4:35:52] <$Dutchpotato> @bob900000 yes, hence why until dawn had the most money
[4:35:52] <Jetsfantasy> I love that cat
[4:35:53] <+Taisuru> THE REACH
[4:35:53] <%weapon000> @Shwepie Aliens possessed by parasites
[4:35:53] <$thomassolorio> hes so sweet
[4:35:55] <DuoScratch> Awwww, him paw at you, him wants the pets!
[4:35:56] <%Kevlar_Caviar> clarice dies no matter what you're good
[4:35:57] <%CappuccinoGuil> @PeachSaliva I love that they pitched this as The Mummy at first, but it turns out it was Aliens.
[4:36:00] <$chance_h> psaBlep
[4:36:00] <sharpened_hammer> C A T R E A C H
[4:36:00] <evermoore_hex> in the multiplayer, theres an option for rachel to dump them both
[4:36:01] <%Sotetsu> Geeze, Until Dawn still isn't on stream.
[4:36:01] <chocobodundee> rachel and eric were the least interesting characters but were made to be the main 2
[4:36:02] <Baljhet> pretty fucking good
[4:36:04] <%Faustgesicht> CLarice can fucking ruin your ending
[4:36:05] <Eldalu> peepee grammar psaGib psaGib
[4:36:05] <%weapon000> nicoHype nicoHype nicoHype nicoHype
[4:36:05] <deviljhojho_> i thought it was pretty good!
[4:36:07] <%Sotetsu> I had a great time, thank you!
[4:36:08] <tjkillemup2> Really good
[4:36:08] <%misdirectedwoo> Salime
[4:36:08] <Sol_Install> I love this one
[4:36:08] <%evbites> Great
[4:36:09] <sun312772> LUL LUL LUL LUL LUL LUL LUL
[4:36:09] <%Kevlar_Caviar> they botched the romance shit but the rest was cool
[4:36:09] <armadaofghosts> That was SICK
[4:36:09] <%KingKrampus> WE LOVED IT
[4:36:09] <OvaltineDream> that was rad
[4:36:10] <+DatAsuna> better than until dawn
[4:36:10] <+sjay662> it's easily the best DPA game
[4:36:11] <%c4llmesnuggles> good game
[4:36:11] <%Explodincatz> very fun to watch
[4:36:11] <+DrGhostJelly> That' was great!
[4:36:11] <Zaphire_Saucypants> I enjoyed seeing you play!
[4:36:12] <+TEANTACLES> i like it a lot, almost as much as until dawn
[4:36:13] <$thomassolorio> o he luv it
[4:36:14] <Aussie_Manny> @PeachSaliva Apparently when Eric was staring at the waterfall, Clarice was supposed to be there.
[4:36:14] <+Taisuru> Pretty cool, relationship stuff was dumb
[4:36:14] <%G_Thunders> Clarice killed Eric in my playthrough
[4:36:15] <missingangle> Overally it was good!
[4:36:16] <+HiroTSK5> Better than Little Hope
[4:36:16] <+TEANTACLES> they finally made a good one again
[4:36:16] <%c4llmesnuggles> fun story good characters
[4:36:17] <+MisterAvry> I thought it was good and with vampires
[4:36:17] <Dunmarkh> It was amazing after little hope
[4:36:17] <iswearimjustdandy> Loved it actually
[4:36:18] <whoisbobx> That was actually the best way to handle Clarice.
[4:36:19] <KLouDraws> alot more engaging
[4:36:19] <$Dutchpotato> It was good, and I enjoyed laughing at some of the dumb stuff
[4:36:19] <SinnerEbru> it was really good!! the first good until dawn followup
[4:36:22] <deviljhojho_> yeah she can kill eric at the last second
[4:36:25] <$goblincat__> @PeachSaliva Clarice kills Eric if you keep her around
[4:36:25] <%evbites> she infected
[4:36:26] <+xcompleasedad> It was about 75% as good as Until Dawn, which makes this a very good game
[4:36:26] <Zaphire_Saucypants> If you let her live, she attack.
[4:36:26] <KingKZ> They should have led with this.
[4:36:29] <%CappuccinoGuil> Clarice kills Eric and she also appears in the waterfall
[4:36:30] <+Kingtut9009> That was like a masterpiece in comparison to Little Hope or whatever it was called
[4:36:37] <Valkryna> your hair looks great btw, Paige sweeth19Hello
[4:36:37] <ZComiX> Makes we want to play Delta Green OP
[4:36:37] <%Monkeyweed21> @chocobodundee and then the writers realized that and made Jason and Salim the heroes in the final act
[4:36:42] <tigerfang86> Nice job MURDERING THAT PERSON
[4:36:42] <deviljhojho_> crikGood
[4:36:43] <+TEANTACLES> if clarice pops out of the waterfall, you can still kill her but the qte is fast i think
[4:36:43] <$thomassolorio> your hair is getting so long it looks lik a water fall of fire
[4:36:44] <%Sotetsu> fmgNICE
[4:36:44] <Tooniearcade> good job icing her!
[4:36:46] <%CappuccinoGuil> Clarice kills Eric in the "Survival" part, 100%
[4:36:48] <%Faustgesicht> She can kill so many characters
[4:36:48] <+furiousfurioso> no she doesnt kill him for sure, you just have to QTE it
[4:36:49] <+sjay662> good job killing that woman Pay
[4:36:50] <Profmcstevie> NO MISTAKES, KILL WOMAN
[4:36:50] <$RealThiele> shoot the infected party member
[4:36:51] <brachydios777> Up there with Untill Dawn
[4:36:51] <+sjay662> Pat
[4:36:52] <Aussie_Manny> Great job killing that girl, Patrick!
[4:36:54] <StebTheVee> Thumbs up for killing woman
[4:36:56] <@MelBrooksKA> Kill the waman
[4:36:57] <eduwardovich> So does the gov't just disappear all of them or something to shut them up?
[4:36:59] <BreakerDS> lol Eric and Ashley Tisdale, I mean Rachel
[4:37:01] <sun312772> pat totally kill that bitch
[4:37:04] <%Monkeyweed21> if you abandoned her as Rachel you wouldn't have been able to shoot her in the head
[4:37:04] <%Sotetsu> Did Zangeif get another knife?
[4:37:06] <+jinking79> phone in the bathroom
[4:37:06] <%ssjklyco> I thought Paige pulled the trigger though
[4:37:07] <WeepProphet> shoot herrr
[4:37:07] <+nicoleymcquack> That fucking eclipse twist threw me for a LOOP
[4:37:10] <critiquequartz> killing the women was the right choice
[4:37:11] <+TEANTACLES> so there were muiltiple ways for Rachel to survive: you could do what you did, you could goo her
[4:37:13] <%CappuccinoGuil> Killing Clarice skipped the waterfall QTEs.
[4:37:14] <$thomassolorio> big and stronk
[4:37:15] <Baljhet> the liquid wasn't on the floor tho
[4:37:16] <%Monkeyweed21> @eduwardovich probably lol
[4:37:16] <+RetroGiinthir> Why Paige dressed like Mista?
[4:37:16] <%cobalt_phoenix_> @eduwardovich probably
[4:37:21] <%Sotetsu> Pet Elmo more.
[4:37:21] <Shwepie> @G_Thunders @weapon000 I guess that's better than them not being real or some other weird explination.
[4:37:21] <bob900000> I'm surprised paige didn't kill any woman
[4:37:25] <$goblincat__> @PeachSaliva Also if Rachel doesn't throw up the parasite, you keep her in that vat of goo and the feds like take her around in a stretcher while she's screaming. It's genuinely horrorfying.
[4:37:27] <%TimberWulfe> also let's mention how Paige sparing Dar led to him getting a much more gruesome and well deserved death.
[4:37:29] <%FingaLights> Don't shit on me Pat
[4:37:32] <+bread_assassin> So does calling Air Support do ANYTHING but screw over Salim?
[4:37:32] <senfood> Choosing the cross on the Old One was the right decision. The cross confuses him. Shooting him just pisses him off.
[4:37:33] <deviljhojho_> first time pat steals paige's gimick and it turns out to be the right choice
[4:37:38] <iswearimjustdandy> Holy shit she is dressed like mista
[4:37:39] <Lorsagne> You missed out on some pretty interesting context for Jason's character with that checkpoint confusion. Not sure if you want to spoil it or leave it for a future playthrough.
[4:37:42] <tigerfang86> ewwwwwwwwwww
[4:37:43] <$StaceMcGate> Elmo is politely asking for pets, he is a good boy
[4:37:43] <%optimasmaximas> WOWWWWWWW
[4:37:45] <deviljhojho_> and if everyoen dies she stays there FOREVER
[4:37:48] <Aussie_Manny> good lord
[4:37:48] <$thomassolorio> fuk
[4:37:49] <KLouDraws> I like how all choices that we thought messed up something ended up giving you the best outcome lol
[4:37:50] <brachydios777> Woooow
[4:37:50] <Coystick> Elmo is crazy cute
[4:37:52] <+TEANTACLES> also if you had white phosphorous, rachel would have had a qte where you can stab a wp grenade and she burns to death
[4:37:56] <%optimasmaximas> @deviljhojho_ wooooooooof
[4:37:56] <+jinking79> and transformation
[4:37:57] <%BlackMage66652> @PeachSaliva Should I buy all three of these games on Steam? I'm not into horror but this looked interesting.
[4:37:59] <+realm_forge> I have photo evidence of dumpster cryptid Paige
[4:38:05] <deviljhojho_> @optimasmaximas REAL bad
[4:38:06] <Coystick> Elmo is precccccious
[4:38:09] <missingangle> @deviljhojho_ Oh that's horrifying
[4:38:16] <%Aleate> The burn is horrifying
[4:38:16] <tigerfang86> DEFINITELY
[4:38:19] <%optimasmaximas> first and last
[4:38:19] <tigerfang86> no little hope
[4:38:23] <deviljhojho_> @missingangle straight up nightmare fuel
[4:38:25] <+MattoBii> Man of Medan is neat
[4:38:25] <$chance_h> psaBig psaBlep
[4:38:25] <Treasure_Vault> Wait for a bundle?
[4:38:26] <Profmcstevie> Until Dawn and House of Ashes for sure
[4:38:26] <%kyh9> I can't believe you goofballs got the best ending on the first run
[4:38:27] <NeroInfinite> Littlehope is fucking nothing for sure.
[4:38:27] <Aussie_Manny> Little Hope no good?
[4:38:27] <+TEANTACLES> rachel has the highest possible number of ways to die out of any of the three games, she can die like 12 times
[4:38:29] <missingangle> Man of Medan is... alright.
[4:38:29] <%FingaLights> unless it's a bundle
[4:38:32] <%generalve> LITTLE HOPE almost killed this series
[4:38:33] <tigerfang86> Man of Medan has some cool parts
[4:38:34] <%Explodincatz> god the cat is so soft
[4:38:36] <+NiktenKing> the only thing that connects to Little Hope was the flashback cutscene that's it
[4:38:38] <Jetsfantasy> Only get all 3 if they pay YOU for Little Hope
[4:38:39] <+DatAsuna> I would honestly ONLY play this
[4:38:40] <Sol_Install> MoM is alright
[4:38:41] <brachydios777> skip the fuck out of little hope
[4:38:41] <%BlackMage66652> They have a bundle for 60 right now
[4:38:41] <KingKZ> Man of Medan has Iceman.
[4:38:42] <%evbites> Also, Eric Could be a shitty bitch and leave nate to die
[4:38:44] <+DatAsuna> man of medan sucks too
[4:38:46] <+Emperor_Machinus> when there is actual monsters it good
[4:38:46] <tigerfang86> wow
[4:38:47] <%Aleate> I really hope this keeps going forward. This one is awesome.
[4:38:50] <bear_breaker20> elmo's leaving so i guess the streams over now
[4:38:52] <%FingaLights> He glows
[4:38:55] <LLCoolZJ> game kill women
[4:38:56] <deviljhojho_> nick?
[4:38:56] <%RayReborne> Nick
[4:38:57] <Zaphire_Saucypants> Nick?
[4:38:58] <+TEANTACLES> nick
[4:38:58] <%generalve> Nick ?
[4:38:58] <%ssjklyco> Nick
[4:38:59] <MaybeFalco> nick
[4:38:59] <Sol_Install> Nick
[4:39:00] <NeroInfinite> nick
[4:39:01] <bob900000> nick?
[4:39:02] <Aussie_Manny> A $120 bundle of all games.
[4:39:04] <%evbites> Nick
[4:39:04] <Dapper_Cactuar> House of Ashes is the first one in the anthology worth playing more than once
[4:39:04] <chocobodundee> i actually like little hope more than medan, but god that ending
[4:39:04] <whoisbobx> Nick
[4:39:07] <%TimberWulfe> right now they are bundled in a way that Little Hope is basically free.
[4:39:07] <%deadmetaphors> I wanna know if the traits had any direct bearing on the ending like they did in Little Hope. Like how people got mordered at the last second if you didn’t unlock all their personality traits
[4:39:09] <%g0atmeal> nickelodeon
[4:39:09] <missingangle> I had very little hope (hue hue) for House of Ashes after Little Hope, to be honest. It was that bad. Glad it proved me wrong
[4:39:10] <%ssjklyco> She left him in the Nick of time
[4:39:12] <%KingKrampus> I still can't believe they pulled off Ancient Sumerian vampires that are ACTUALLY Aliens who are controlled by Animorphs Yeerks, I LOVE THIS
[4:39:13] <%Sotetsu> I bet if Rachel chooses Nick, Eric leaves him to die.
[4:39:14] <%tempestzephyr> gotta kill ashley tisdale
[4:39:19] <%evbites> Nick nate same thing
[4:39:21] <Aussie_Manny> gg ez first try
[4:39:25] <%BlackMage66652> @Aussie_Manny It's 60 for all three right now
[4:39:28] <+DatAsuna> I think man of medan is a waste of time
[4:39:31] <tigerfang86> oooooooooooh
[4:39:31] <Profmcstevie> The lesson of house of ashes.....bro fuck bugs
[4:39:38] <deviljhojho_> its probably until dawn, house of ashes, powergap man of medan, and another powergap little hope
[4:39:39] <$chance_h> Until Dawn > House of Asses> man of Medan >> little hope
[4:39:42] <+jinking79> all Little Hopes endings sucks
[4:39:48] <%Monkeyweed21> I think you can put Rachel in the goo and then get everyone killed and it results in a REAL BAD ENDING @PeachSaliva
[4:39:49] <Aussie_Manny> I was NOT expecting the eclipse.
[4:39:49] <SinnerEbru> yeah it was TOO bright
[4:39:52] <%Sotetsu> That last bit was sooooo stressfull.
[4:39:54] <%Faustgesicht> Shot like the ending
[4:40:00] <AngryAsian5> Yeah, the eclipse twist was fuckin GREAT
[4:40:01] <+NiktenKing> they were like... fuck yeah... OH SHIT
[4:40:05] <%FingaLights> Good fake out. With a callback
[4:40:06] <%optimasmaximas> @PeachSaliva you can save merwin apparently
[4:40:07] <$goblincat__> @PeachSaliva Also there's slight references to aliens throughout the game. In the very beginning Dar says the invaders are coming, and later on Salim says "I come in peace"
[4:40:10] <%RayReborne> Someone said they announced in the briefing room at the start there would be an eclipse
[4:40:11] <%Sotetsu> Every jump scare from Gief.
[4:40:15] <theredfox930000> little hope was the best atpDance atpDance atpDance spookyRain
[4:40:17] <Aussie_Manny> oooooohhh
[4:40:18] <%CappuccinoGuil> @PeachSaliva In the convo with Salim, Jason would've opened his heart up about the war and the checkpoint. He admits he's not really patriotic, just a stoner kid who had nothing to do and decided to join the army. It's all a front.
[4:40:18] <+TEANTACLES> so Jason, if you have the moment with him and Salim, he opens up that he was a high stoner when 9/11 happened and didn't hear about it for like a week, he signed up not because he actually believed in the war
[4:40:20] <deviljhojho_> no he fuckin dies
[4:40:22] <OvaltineDream> hey we never saw him die
[4:40:23] <+TEANTACLES> his racism is kind of a cop out
[4:40:23] <DracaenaLeaf> but he dies later
[4:40:25] <StebTheVee> temporarily
[4:40:26] <+CaptainJax> i dont believe that for a second
[4:40:29] <MaybeFalco> you cant
[4:40:30] <Zombrocom> He can live a bit longer but he always dies
[4:40:32] <chocobodundee> it was very aliens with a slight pitch black
[4:40:33] <+Mr_Pylon> There's quite a lot more content playing online coop
[4:40:33] <bob900000> temporary
[4:40:35] <%generalve> Merwin can last a little.longer but still dies
[4:40:35] <tjkillemup2> merwin always dies it just happens sooner or later
[4:40:36] <drunken_lemur> Dar caps him
[4:40:38] <%strakillias> He can make it all the way to camp but gets shot by Dar
[4:40:39] <sirrice77> Merwin always dies but he can live long enough to fix the radio
[4:40:41] <+TEANTACLES> you can save merwin up until the point where they fix the radio, he can fix the radio
[4:40:42] <+chiazam> @PeachSaliva If you choose to carry Merwin he bleeds out later
[4:40:42] <HalloweenHangover> He's destined to die in a shootout with the Iraqi captain
[4:40:44] <$RC_S3kshun8> You can save Merwin long enough to fix the generator but he still dies long term @PeachSaliva
[4:40:44] <%BlackMage66652> Saving Merwen leads to him catching a bullet from Dar later
[4:40:44] <+NiktenKing> nah he dies for sure but it still plot relevant
[4:40:45] <deviljhojho_> but they are right in that you can save him for a whiel
[4:40:47] <stealthfart> He can last for awhile
[4:40:47] <%TimberWulfe> I read that Supermassive did their homework because a Solar Eclipse actually did occur on that date in 2003
[4:40:50] <%FingaLights> is it outside?
[4:40:54] <whoisbobx> If you keep Merwin alive he can fix the radio but Dar shoots him I believe.
[4:40:54] <%CappuccinoGuil> Merwin dies every time. You can save him, but he lives long enough to repair the radio and gets shot by Dar.
[4:40:55] <deviljhojho_> if you save merwin Salim gets screwed tho
[4:40:57] <mike2hands> He super died
[4:41:03] <%RayReborne> Hey chat you got the ass reveal you wanted
[4:41:06] <%optimasmaximas> NO WAY
[4:41:08] <+NiktenKing> that's rad
[4:41:09] <Zaphire_Saucypants> Someone tell her Jason's backstory?
[4:41:09] <%Faustgesicht> Dar domes Merwin
[4:41:11] <%NeoCre> He just dies later after fixing the radio (and therefore getting Salim caught)
[4:41:12] <%Reaped_Psyche> HA!
[4:41:13] <+TEANTACLES> pat showed us his orbs
[4:41:14] <Aussie_Manny> wow 🧠
[4:41:15] <%FingaLights> That's wild

[4:41:25] <mike2hands> Datum pat got that dumpy@indeed
[4:41:28] <bob900000> I hope they got a good director for the next game
[4:41:32] <%Monkeyweed21> @PeachSaliva I think you can put Rachel in the goo and then get everyone else killed for a real bad ending
[4:41:33] <afronooch> D U M P Y
[4:41:33] <%generalve> Ginger Bussy
[4:41:34] <%CappuccinoGuil> Paige, you want to know Jason's backstory?

[4:41:44] <+realm_forge> SHOW ASS YOU COWARD
[4:41:44] <drunken_lemur> @deviljhojho_ I can't believe this game REQUIRES you to get some characters killed for the best ending.
[4:41:44] <evermoore_hex> dumpy bussy
[4:41:45] <ExpressNode> I did hear the reverse beeping earlier
[4:41:46] <%generalve> Dumpy Bussy Kappa

[4:42:10] <evermoore_hex> give big thank
[4:42:10] <drunken_lemur> This playthrough is up there with Pat's Until Dawn LP
[4:42:15] <+athuramn> take a breather goblins
[4:42:16] <%CappuccinoGuil> @PeachSaliva In the convo with Salim, Jason would've opened his heart up about the war and the checkpoint. He admits he's not really patriotic, just a stoner kid who had nothing to do and decided to join the army. It's all a front.
[4:42:18] <+jinking79> lock your accounts Pat
[4:42:20] <$chance_h> By the door or counter?
[4:42:22] <deviljhojho_> dont worry about it you still got the GOLDEN PATH
[4:42:25] <%NeoCre> Need to get a Tile to buzz phone
[4:42:30] <Sol_Install> it's fine
[4:42:31] <Zaphire_Saucypants> There's actually a point, and I THINK you get it cuz of the Checkpoint reveal, where Jason reveals he was actually high as fuck when the towers fell, and he just joined cuz his life was going nowhere.
[4:42:39] <%CappuccinoGuil> He was high AF when the planes hit
[4:42:39] <%optimasmaximas> OH  shit
[4:42:39] <StebTheVee> like real life
[4:42:44] <Profmcstevie> Weeeeed lmao
[4:42:45] <%greasypete00> so it wasnt even real racism
[4:42:46] <Admiral_PopnFresh> SECRET FAKE RACIST
[4:42:48] <+chiazam> like in real life
[4:42:48] <deviljhojho_> yeah he wasnt aware 9/!1 happened for like a week
[4:42:49] <%optimasmaximas> daaaaamn
[4:42:49] <sun312772> good job
[4:42:50] <%AncelDeLambert> wow I hate him, then
[4:42:50] <%Sotetsu> Dang
[4:42:52] <Prevot> oof
[4:42:53] <tigerfang86> REAL FAKE RACISM
[4:42:53] <+TEANTACLES> he didn't hear about 9/11 until like 2 weeks later
[4:42:53] <SinnerEbru> damn so like a lot of guys
[4:42:53] <$goblincat__> @PeachSaliva I personally think this game handled the backdrop of the Iraq war SO tactfully
[4:42:56] <Lorsagne> The twist with Jason is that he admits the patriotism is overcompensating because he was literally too stoned to realize 9/11 happened until like a week later
[4:42:57] <+Kyma1020> what a poser XD
[4:42:59] <%g0atmeal> undercover racist
[4:42:59] <Dunmarkh> Instead you denied your based warcrimes at the checkpoint
[4:43:02] <ExpressNode> Fakecist?
[4:43:02] <TheHeroAppears> no the racism is real
[4:43:05] <Baljhet> i mean, learned social racism isn't all that unusual
[4:43:05] <StebTheVee> most people enlisted are school dropouts
[4:43:05] <%RayReborne> Fake it till you make it
[4:43:06] <%generalve> he never cared about 9/11
[4:43:07] <Jetsfantasy> Propaganda got to him
[4:43:07] <+TEANTACLES> i mean he's a racist but he's like... less dedicated to it than you'd expect
[4:43:07] <%ssjklyco> is the accent fake
[4:43:10] <eyeobject> real racist fake patriot
[4:43:11] <+DatAsuna> Have you ever talked to a marine?
[4:43:13] <%optimasmaximas> LUL
[4:43:13] <LLCoolZJ> Jason is a stoner like Salim's son makes you think
[4:43:14] <MaybeFalco> indoctrination
[4:43:15] <%Sotetsu> I was confused by the Checkpoint option, too.
[4:43:16] <bob900000> LUL
[4:43:16] <%SonofMelonHead> tbf, america as a whole kinda went crazy around 9/11
[4:43:17] <Zaphire_Saucypants> He's a grower, not a shower.
[4:43:18] <%CappuccinoGuil> LUL
[4:43:19] <%evbites> Join the mob mentality
[4:43:20] <%Monkeyweed21> He's just a stoner that watched too much Fox News and Rush Limbaugh
[4:43:20] <+TEANTACLES> his accent is REAL BAD
[4:43:21] <Profmcstevie> I was based....accidentally
[4:43:21] <Dunmarkh> LUL
[4:43:21] <deviljhojho_> LUL
[4:43:22] <+TEANTACLES> as a texan
[4:43:27] <+TEANTACLES> what the fuck is jason's accent
[4:43:28] <evermoore_hex> how can it be a warcrime if i had so much fun doing it?
[4:43:30] <%Sotetsu> I forgot what Checkpoint meant.
[4:43:31] <%CappuccinoGuil> My uncle is a Marine, the attitude checks out LUL
[4:43:34] <%vehementvadr> he also makes out with Salim if you step on all the mosd
[4:43:35] <deviljhojho_> He is actually from maine
[4:43:37] <$chance_h> Casual racism rather than ranked competitive racism
[4:43:39] <%NeoCre> He overcompensated due to guilt of being stoned throughout the attack
[4:43:41] <churropoppa> @TEANTACLES Georgia
[4:43:41] <sun312772> Peach is big DUMB DUMB
[4:43:43] <tanarath> Paige a-ok with warcrimes hard confirmed.
[4:43:44] <%CappuccinoGuil> Yeah, for sure.
[4:43:45] <%evbites> WARcrems
[4:43:46] <%superc37> also he killed a woman who he thought was a suicide bomberbut rly she was holing groceries
[4:43:55] <Zaphire_Saucypants> he ordered Nick tto kill a lady with a bag, thinking she had a bomb. It was groceries actually.
[4:43:56] <SinnerEbru> it happens paige, its no damage 💝💝
[4:44:01] <deviljhojho_> braing lag
[4:44:03] <%evbites> ARE THEY?
[4:44:04] <RetroCop87> "Paige, they killed a girl!" "Eh, it was a week ago, whatevs"
[4:44:07] <Treasure_Vault> That's dumb, I'm stoned during most disasters
[4:44:08] <%optimasmaximas> LUL
[4:44:08] <eyeobject> Sun just go down
[4:44:08] <%generalve> Paige your like my dad drinking giant bottles
[4:44:10] <+TEANTACLES> @TEANTACLES is that a georgian accent??? damn we get too much shit in texas when yall got that goin on
[4:44:15] <%FingaLights> She just wants to stop and look at flowers

[4:47:16] <%Ranryu692> I remember literally nothing about Man of Medan LUL
[4:47:20] <eduwardovich> This needed like 70% less relationship drama
[4:47:21] <Profmcstevie> They gave her bug eyes, it's the way of the mocap

[4:47:40] <SinnerEbru> goddd giefy is so muscular and sleek
[4:47:40] <%Monkeyweed21> @TEANTACLES the vampires take their time killing because they feed off the adrenaline in the blood
[4:47:41] <Dementedpenguin> Lighters DansGame
[4:47:41] <%AncelDeLambert> it had zero actual impact on the plot
[4:47:43] <+Ironbuttz> Does Zangief ever not want you to pet him?  I have a dog a few months younger and he rarely lets me pet him.
[4:47:44] <Zaphire_Saucypants> Were they crashed into by the same bus driver? Also yes, the relationship shit detracted a smidge.
[4:47:46] <$goblincat__> @PeachSaliva I think about this vs a David Cage came, and with the brackdrop of the Iraq war being so delicate, it could've gone SO bad

[4:48:04] <Zombrocom> You can have her break up with both of em
[4:48:06] <whoisbobx> Rachel broke up with both of them in my playthrough.
[4:48:07] <%NeoCre> @kayamek Considering the premise of Little Hope, the only connection it’ll get is being the shithole that Eric lost his leg at
[4:48:09] <tjkillemup2> Eric might leave nick to die if he hates Nick
[4:48:09] <$chance_h> David Cage comes
[4:48:15] <evermoore_hex> she can choose to be with nick or be single
[4:48:17] <%Monkeyweed21> @TEANTACLES the vampires got discovered by the archeaologists in like the 30s

[4:54:26] <$TIME_PUNCHER> switch black sounds like Trudeu's new election campaign
[4:54:35] <%BlackMage66652> @PeachSaliva 60 on Steam for all three games
[4:54:37] <%TimberWulfe> it's $60, basically Little Hope is free
[4:54:38] <%evbites> And it made no sense

[4:54:49] <+Mr_Pylon> unless the whole universe is a fever dream of that man
[4:54:57] <+Taisuru> Literally the reference to it in this game was "Little Hope exists"
[4:55:00] <$goblincat__> Little Hope sounds like the shitty version of Shattered Memories
[4:55:04] <+jinking79> little hope is for some ppl not all
