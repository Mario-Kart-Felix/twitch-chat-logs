[0:19:36] <%TheOnlyStrayCat> pride1500 I get that sort of life. I have like half of that myself. Like the incident with my brother and a gun he shouldn't have had. Or my legitimately crazy ex who crawled back to me EVERY year to try and get me to move back down with her in Tennessee and be part of her multi-baby-daddy harem or whatever the fuck. Mind, I made up a REALLY fucked up lie to tell her that finally stopped her from trying that. I mean FUCKED UP.

I like being told what to do." And not 5 minutes later I run into a trainer, who's a red headed maid, and the game verbatim says "'I have low self-esteem, so I like having someone else give me orders.' You are challenged by Maid Paige." Trippy, man.

[0:50:55] <$wolfofsound> YES read it
[0:50:56] <%TheOnlyStrayCat> cheer500 Pat was close, but it was not her household, and was in fact my father's household, as I was living with him and his wive and kids, and 3 dogs. And that is hint #2.
[0:50:57] <viviknight> Christopher Robin gave my husband PTSD
[0:50:59] <+Menitta> Hello there
[0:51:00] <+rabidclone> the anime's pacing and animation SUCKS
[0:51:00] <+Chimeraelite> facts
[0:51:02] <seniorwhiteface> Winnie the Pooh vs Hitler is best anime
[0:51:04] <Zeemod155> 0
[0:51:04] <+shawntk_> The anime pacing really is bad
[0:51:04] <OwlLightningMage> Hunter x Hunter is better than One Piece.
[0:51:04] <Colorband> 22-episode episode
[0:51:05] <$GoogleyGareth> New Railith Comic @PeachSaliva
[0:51:06] <twistedj3ster> 4 minutes
[0:51:07] <$Agami23> every ball is the meteor from FLCL
[0:51:08] <+Semievil77> True for once
[0:51:08] <%swordsman70> I just started today
[0:51:09] <$happyface699> Clair bbbbbbbbbb
[0:51:09] <%Solidnick18> not much
[0:51:10] <bambowl> true
[0:51:12] <+NightOwlSam> 2minutes
[0:51:12] <$mandragoraroot> NotLikeThis oh god
[0:51:12] <TheGershon> WATCH ONE PACE IT'S LIKE KAI
[0:51:15] <Graxe_> And then a new video on the channel appears: Super Best Friends Beat Christopher Robin
[0:51:15] <%SuichiTanaka> 16 minutes
[0:51:15] <%Lion_kun> He is correct
[0:51:18] <$happyface699> clair bbbbbbbbbb
[0:51:18] <Flyrant> When can we expect sick guard fly combos in DMC 4 Pat?
[0:51:25] <$happyface699> clair bbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbb
[0:51:26] <+hawk_rush> yeah, the anime is shit
[0:51:26] <MrSyne> Yeah the pacing killed that series for me.
[0:51:27] <Worldbrand> bnha didnt quite have that problem but it sure felt like it in s1
[0:51:27] <RipSlamsteak> the one piece anime is garbage, please read the manga instead
[0:51:30] <%Freelance7> munny
[0:51:30] <%2Metronomes> Shonen jump loves to stretch shit out. Naruto is real bad too
[0:51:31] <$Sphincter_Spelunker> Past Fishman Island is really bad
[0:51:31] <%SuperCasualBoom> More like Shit Piece...üëå
[0:51:31] <+hawk_rush> manga is still good tho
[0:51:31] <+ShoHayabusa> Editing at its best.
[0:51:33] <NopeBadguy> READ THE MANGA
[0:51:36] <%swordsman70> Like almost 20
[0:51:36] <%Klefth> And then they have whole fights that consist of panning still images
[0:51:36] <+pact_gg> I think Oda is an insane man
[0:51:36] <%ssjklyco> They've made the opening 2 and a half minutes
[0:51:37] <$happyface699> Like attack on titan
[0:51:37] <%Lion_kun> Doing the manga is the smarter choice.
[0:51:38] <+absolutenc> wow that's insane
[0:51:39] <JGardner88> Agreed I prefer to read that over than watch it
[0:51:41] <turf_wind_and_fire> Tier Pee?
[0:51:44] <Coystick> Read the Peach
[0:51:44] <Karhax> Look upon my my pitch ye mighty and despair
[0:51:45] <$wolfofsound> @PeachSaliva good things going on in the manga now
[0:51:45] <%Klefth> Entire episodes of a narrator blabbing on
[0:51:47] <+PipIV> money money money money money money motherfucker
[0:51:47] <Coystick> I mean the Mango
[0:51:47] <+HeyBoston> don't read the manga, just bury your head in the sand
[0:51:47] <devanmuse> See, this is why the Seasonal system is better. It worked/works for My Hero
[0:51:49] <+wydamn> Wait, is One Piece still going? Are they at episode 1200 now?
[0:51:49] <vampireinarm> have you seen the GOBLIN SLAYERT
[0:51:50] <$GoogleyGareth> apatDab apatDab apatDab
[0:51:52] <Sol_Install> yeah read the manga its just good
[0:51:53] <Parkerthomas> I couldnt watch Naruto because they recap the last 15 minutes of the previous episode
[0:51:54] <Futurecity10> One piece is 19 years old
[0:51:54] <Laironx3> Readin One Piece is better than watching it

[0:51:58] <arcaderabbit48> Naruto was the same way, where every new episode was basically one chapter worth of content. It was fucking awful.
[0:51:59] <+badchoice5> I don't think the dab emote actually exists, it's a myth
[0:51:59] <@Calek> reading One Piece got rough at some point, fifty million side characters all have something to say per page

[1:22:33] <Mr_Strut> Humans like when machines work properly
[1:22:33] <viviknight> Connor can make it through though
[1:22:34] <gyrogogozeppeli> All Connor's death was Pat;s fault
[1:22:34] <doofmaster> third time, you died in the opening
[1:22:34] <crimsonharvest> No paige, because he's starting to treat you like a peer
[1:22:35] <@Calek> hostage situation, interrogation room, highway
[1:22:35] <%RaikenTB> Hank hates it Connor dies.
[1:22:38] <dybia> Hank likes you because you value your own life
[1:22:39] <VritraReiRei> WRONG. THIRD!
[1:22:40] <OwlLightningMage> Hank's motivations are dumb and inconsistent
[1:22:40] <Bouldus> yea you followed your superior officers orders
[1:22:41] <SuperNotSuspiciousMan> it's because you don't die like a chump
[1:22:42] <%Typhaeon> Pat's going all Plague on us
[1:22:42] <Flurbleman44> hank's legit
[1:22:43] <%AncelDeLambert> no, he likes you because you're not a SUICIDAL FREAK
[1:22:45] <DedlokPM> @PeachSaliva Connor can chase and survive
[1:22:45] <ArcticAsylum> BE GOOD TO HANK
[1:22:45] <vybben> D:
[1:22:45] <Zeikier> THEM DIRTY TIN CAN

[1:22:47] <%GohanEgret> @Zzross_the_savagezz no deaths tonight
[1:22:48] <+Williamld> @gyrogogozeppeli It was obviously matt, dude
[1:22:49] <TezarroEX> its because you're being a rational human being and not a robot
[1:22:51] <rararasputino> Listening to law enforcement superiors? what a cunt
[1:22:52] <frozenottsel> Because Hank doesn't want you to die
[1:22:52] <+skizzuto> Pat way to almost spoil there
[1:22:54] <Zeikier> always bet on black
[1:22:55] <mboeblay> Hank can pull you out before you find them pat
[1:22:55] <dybia> You didn't act like a machine with no self preservation
[1:22:56] <PumaOfDarkness> Pat, you fucked up there.
[1:22:58] <Coystick> Because you listen
[1:22:58] <+khalcipher> Hanks see you as a human he does not want you dead
[1:22:58] <rararasputino> David cage stacks the black hair odds
[1:22:58] <gyrogogozeppeli> @Williamld nah Pat's just slow
[1:22:59] <twistedj3ster> PAT LET IT SLIP
[1:23:00] <%Sinister_Aglet> so did pat just confirm to paige about alice

[1:23:00] <%Freelance7> Jesus Pat
[1:23:01] <fireking900> ok pat shut up for real
[1:23:01] <VritraReiRei> @PeachSaliva you died in the opening, during the interogation, and during this chase scene
[1:23:04] <benjiFG> does anyone remember during the Beyond Two Souls playthrough when Pat saw a ghost but convinced himself it was someone he already saw
[1:23:04] <ancrest_tant> Humans hate it when things that look like humans die
[1:23:08] <frozenottsel> how vanilla...
[1:23:10] <blackwolf4567> @theonlystraycat What even was it?
[1:23:12] <vybben> he said it,,,
[1:23:12] <%Sinister_Aglet> This is the second time he called them both androids
[1:23:17] <ArcticAsylum> Hank is the best person in this game, please be good to him
[1:23:17] <+ShoHayabusa> Or peeing pat.
[1:23:19] <+HeyBoston> analyze pat andoid
[1:23:20] <+Quigsies> It's a pat-droid
[1:23:20] <kambamdamn> Pat!!!!
[1:23:21] <Coystick> Listen to your friends and value their council
[1:23:22] <+AntithesisEK> analyze patron 3000
[1:23:23] <+chetasaur> patdriod
[1:23:23] <%deacon1621> Squat Pat
[1:23:25] <filialpails> the squat android is patron
[1:23:26] <Zeikier> pat stop self inserting yourself into this game lol
[1:23:33] <+nolifegamin> Wait I'm pretty sure you can miss Kara, that's why it branches off
[1:23:33] <%Typhaeon> Warhammer 40K dorf android
[1:23:35] <%caliginouscalico> man the translation on this game has some problems
[1:23:36] <+Ssaik> God I hate this game
[1:23:40] <$ScallyCapt> check fire, read magazine
[1:23:43] <+FrostMass22> Hank is a fuck, I wish he would hate androids more if Markus is a genocidal maniac
[1:23:45] <TezarroEX> oh did pat let it slip out, thats funny she didn't notice
[1:23:45] <+NightOwlSam> one of those is miss seeing kara, and hank gets you to leave
[1:23:47] <+twohitgood> squatter is the term they wanted to use, not squat.
[1:23:49] <%ssjklyco> Is Squat android actually not named Ralph?
[1:23:50] <SailingSaturn> Found out LUL
[1:23:51] <Coystick> Analyze Pat
[1:23:55] <Prism_Wing> Squat Android sounds like a Megaman X character.
[1:24:00] <+NightOwlSam> @ssjklyco it is Ralph
[1:24:01] <%caliginouscalico> anyone remember hurricanes in the midwest? or conjure?
[1:24:12] <gyrogogozeppeli> Squat Android sounds like a Stand
[1:24:16] <OwlLightningMage> Hank is fuck that hates and loves androids for some reason
[1:24:16] <Zeikier> he's prolly named Ralph but that's not how Connor sees them, cuz Kara is called AX400
[1:24:27] <%ssjklyco> @NightOwlSam but why not say ralph then.

[1:25:37] <@Calek> literally tonight they're going to snitch
[1:25:38] <PhantomMaskJr> Hi Pat ammoFlexL sbfpRed ammoFlexR
[1:25:39] <pede2011> TECHNICALLY NOW IS LATER THAN BEFORE
[1:25:39] <%ssjklyco> she'll forget anyway
[1:25:40] <PumaOfDarkness> He said "Androids." Plural.
[1:25:41] <Coystick> !! Alice at Risk !!
[1:25:41] <Bouldus> well snitching would mean you guys spoiling it, which youve been specifically asked not too
[1:25:42] <MasterDecoder> Oh, OH
[1:25:46] <heatrashes> PAT TYPE OUT THE SPOILER was it the alice thing?
[1:25:47] <Klarrann3> WE ARE A HOSTAGE TO PAT
[1:25:48] <%MaximumDaximum> Pat, have you been playing MHGen or MHWorld?
[1:25:50] <gyrogogozeppeli> The fact that Alice cant die sucks
[1:25:50] <mboeblay> it's possible to run out of time investigating the house
[1:25:53] <PinkSocks> Oh shit he actually spoiled it
[1:25:57] <SailingSaturn> @PeachSaliva just play it off as deviants and Humans = Devimans
[1:25:57] <umbracatalyst> SNITCHING GO UP
[1:25:58] <Coystick> Snitch=Ban
[1:25:58] <%iwishthiswasicq> Where'd Paige go? Did she spill another cup of piss?
[1:25:59] <%Sinister_Aglet> Story would have improved
[1:25:59] <Xel_Gel> @PeachSaliva yo Pat you see the easteregg on the game DISC
[1:26:01] <+patriotrenegade> that wouldve been great
[1:26:02] <+pleasenameyourcharacter> A Little, Idiot Child Emulator. A.L.I.C.E
[1:26:02] <turf_wind_and_fire> I got it now
[1:26:03] <bambowl> same
[1:26:03] <+NightOwlSam> if they die here, you never find out about Alice
[1:26:04] <fireking900> He said "them androids" guys
[1:26:04] <+FrostMass22> It would make the game better
[1:26:05] <dking0000> Pat you‚Äôre the one who tells us all snitch super hard all the time
[1:26:07] <SuperNotSuspiciousMan> I wanted it to happen so bad
[1:26:07] <%heyitsbrian> what happened?
[1:26:07] <%Picabunny> DO I HOLD IT?
[1:26:07] <Davifflaelan> Pat get Peach to drag the dead robot at the camp to the truck and get Kara to climb onto the truck leaving Alice behind
[1:26:08] <gyrogogozeppeli> Story would be better without fake child
[1:26:09] <+khalcipher> What did he spoil?
[1:26:10] <%zal_silverfang> @PeachSaliva so pat, does the whole [ Timestop ] little girl thing make you even more pissed with the house scene?
[1:26:10] <+nolifegamin> I really wish there was a Kara solo storyline, BUT NO CAGE NEEDS THE ROBO CHILD
[1:26:10] <RichAnvils> snitches get stitches...in their sides from laughing so much. snitch
[1:26:11] <Mr_Strut> Paige loves murdering women. It'll happen eventually.
[1:26:12] <$mandragoraroot> i wouldnt be surprised if they couldnt die there
[1:26:12] <Ninjagregory98> I also wanted that
[1:26:13] <+shawntk_> @gyrogogozeppeli No, she can, she did when I played it
[1:26:13] <$joylent_blue> what exactly did he say
[1:26:14] <mercado94> theres other oportunities to death kara and child dont worry
[1:26:15] <leinadtonu> Ptricio you are a cool man.

[1:26:20] <OwlLightningMage> I wouldn't dare spoil how fucking stupid that twist is. I want Paige's raw pain at the stupid
[1:26:21] <+G_Thunders> The pacing works a lot better if they die in that scene imo
[1:26:23] <KilljoyHexx> no snitch NOW
[1:26:23] <DedlokPM> @PeachSaliva You should make the pee sound. Just in case. teenJOY
[1:26:23] <+Xeno351> so you could tell her that ze child is ze robot
[1:26:24] <gyrogogozeppeli> @shawntk_ wheres the time she can die

[1:26:25] <+AntithesisEK> delayed snitch mechanics
[1:26:25] <%comb711> I kind of thought Paige might have stood still during the todd murder part
[1:26:28] <Lazaruz95> No but snitching now would be more fun
[1:26:28] <JGardner88> I kinda realised how early Paige could've killed Kara and it was terrible
[1:26:29] <%SuperCasualBoom> She kills the women but not the children.
[1:26:31] <turf_wind_and_fire> Chat, Pat said AndroidSSSSSSS *HINT HINT HINT*

[1:27:45] <%caliginouscalico> cheer200 so I dont know if you caught this, but "conjure" has an alternate meaning, where it can be used to mean beg. it was commonly used this way in the 18th century. this game has some large translation mistakes, which is weird, because beyond and heavy rain didn't. hurricanes in the midwest still gets me, because it might be a mistake or it might not be.
[1:27:46] <Bouldus> goblin slayer is fantastic
[1:27:46] <+coolthulhuu> its big on rape

[2:16:42] <gyrogogozeppeli> Adventure Time with Paige and Pat
[2:16:43] <+pleasenameyourcharacter> SPOILER ALERT: since it's called "Jericho," and Cage has no subtlety, does that mean that the correct route is Connor knocking down that sumbitche's walls and killing all the deviants?
[2:16:50] <+FrostMass22> Cage is an idiot confirmed
[2:16:51] <@Calek> play for another five minutes you'll hit a good break

[2:18:53] <$ooblagis> cheer400 Since apparently donation notes tonight are about shitty illnesses, I have a fun one. A few months ago I caught bronchitis on a trip to Vegas, then had to go work at my long haul trucking job. I was pretty woozy so I was drifting over the white line a bit and got pulled over by the cops since some old lady thought I was drunk and called 911 and complaine. I pulled over to the shoulder, then the shoulder gave way and my truck and trailer flipped into the steep ditch. Then I got fired.
[2:18:55] <+PipIV> street tacos
[2:18:57] <%rdark_ksu> chicken place. and hank wants to say he has taste

[2:19:18] <PiGreat> @nolifegamin oh shit i forgot about that. jericho is the third most cagey, zlatko is the second most cagey and the first is the reveal

[2:27:08] <Ropcord> i mean he did just point the gun at connor for a second there so i'd say no
[2:27:09] <devanmuse> I think Pat said in the LP that Connor being able to die and be rebooted later on actually solved the "no game overs" problem of Beyond. You can still fuck up and die, but the story can still reach a satisfying conclusion regardless
[2:27:09] <Nobrev> well he does plan on shooting

[2:27:28] <%Picabunny> One of my biggest pet peeves about this game is that NOBODY has ANY trigger discipline. .....You know, below the racism and hamfisted metaphors.

[2:27:48] <$jorgamund> @Ropcord yeah, except he doesn't consider it a problem to shoot Connor, so it's fine (for Hank)
[2:27:49] <Zzross_the_savagezz> John Woo was called in to direct this one scene.
[2:27:53] <Colorband> very slightly though
[2:27:54] <+G_Thunders> The maze is just an encryption key. It‚Äôs in concept art from like 2015 so it‚Äôs not like they took the imagery from West world

[2:28:16] <$ScallyCapt> doesnt look like anything to me
[2:28:18] <$joylent_blue> Hank and Connor feel much more like father/son to me, so the romantic shipping really creeps me out
[2:28:19] <twistedj3ster> @Bupkis7 No the fuck you don't
[2:28:19] <sykehm> I WONDER IF DAVID CAGE LIKES THE MOVIE PRISONERS

[2:30:37] <element_of_loyalty> KISS
[2:30:43] <twistedj3ster> "Your LED is in the sink."
[2:30:52] <+NightOwlSam> LEDs were a new addition, so older models had them added, so I guess they're easy to remove once deviancy kicks in
[2:30:54] <+patriotrenegade> Rack
[2:30:54] <+FrostMass22> Ra9 means literally nothing

[2:31:22] <axelcezar> westorld reference! shame it is a shit show
[2:31:25] <Graxe_> @Flyrant It's assumed that the LED was added to androids only to meet regulations.
[2:31:34] <%Freelance7> Westworld S2 fucking sucks
[2:31:35] <element_of_loyalty> why
[2:31:37] <+NightOwlSam> floor

[2:31:39] <doofmaster> it is shocking that there are only traces
[2:31:43] <ccrida> @Flyrant It's basically just a sticker they aren't attached to anything besides the HDD or equivalent to denote stress in an android
[2:31:45] <VikingEagle> Actually, would you guys say that this game is better than Season 2 of West World?
[2:31:46] <Colorband> "it's westworld reference" "no it isn't" - chat

[2:59:22] <SGrim> Don't drive tired. End of that story. No offense, but you're operating a vehicle that can kill with one mistake.
[2:59:22] <$ooblagis> The shoulder was new and very steep. They since widened it considerably
[2:59:23] <Wyrmsblood> Look at all these losers getting sick all the time
[2:59:35] <suikudo> in 3 hours it will be my b-day but because its Monday ill be spending it alone
[2:59:39] <%LordMoonIV> The viewers of this stream has an odd tendency to either be fired or are in interviews for new jobs
[2:59:41] <element_of_loyalty> house
[2:59:43] <Zinectrik> Dr. House PogChamp
[2:59:44] <CrystalDiglett> you guys still get sick? Pathetic Kappa
[2:59:48] <+FrostMass22> The test gives you lupus
[2:59:59] <+cereal_box_conspiracy> The soda thing is probably satire.
[3:00:00] <element_of_loyalty> Relly?
[3:00:01] <+PipIV> @suikudo early HAPPY BIRTHDAY! apatDab
[3:00:02] <CrystalDiglett> NYEH
[3:00:02] <+chetasaur> its never lupus unless it is
[3:00:05] <element_of_loyalty> MYEA
[3:00:07] <+pleasenameyourcharacter> that reminds me of when i had a total breakdown at a catscan since they had to try 3 times to find a vein. the 3rd try worked, but that spot wasn't numb.
[3:00:08] <doofmaster> it's about as much as a 2L soda
[3:00:11] <suikudo> @PipIV ty
[3:00:13] <%AncelDeLambert> that calorie count wasn't a fucking typo

[3:00:43] <element_of_loyalty> YOU'RE MY FAVORITE ELMO PARENT
[3:00:44] <+badchoice5> You're my favorite streamer that I'm currently watching!
[3:00:44] <+skizzuto> what about better paige?
[3:00:44] <gyrogogozeppeli> its filler
[3:00:45] <mr_slaide> What about Diamond Dallas Page?
[3:00:48] <gyrogogozeppeli> Yakuza 3 is filler
[3:00:51] <+nolifegamin> I thought it was ok
[3:00:55] <+NightOwlSam> LUL
[3:00:58] <KaliasTV> What about Beyond Good and Evil Pey'j
[3:01:00] <energywarning> the premise and framework is interesting, but execution was awful
[3:01:00] <AlasterAngelo> Yakuza 3's story is not very good by any metric
[3:01:01] <%AncelDeLambert> I'mma about to buy Zero, what with it only being twenty bucks
[3:01:02] <mistermastergreg> FIGHT THE TIGERS OLD MAN
[3:01:02] <deviljhojho94> Yakuza 4 is so goodd tho

[3:01:20] <$Sphincter_Spelunker> @suikudo Never worry about day of celcration stuff. There is always the weekend. Unless you're in a relationship. Then consult your SO, duh SeemsGood
[3:01:24] <deviljhojho94> its a steal

[3:02:35] <%thisisnotNR> INI FILE
[3:02:36] <$Sphincter_Spelunker> @pleasenameyourcharacter Don't be weird and it'll be fine. Be cool, my man CoolCat
[3:02:36] <$ooblagis> Yeah, but SOMA arguments
[3:02:37] <%SuperCasualBoom> It‚Äôs not delivery, it the Lupus.
[3:02:40] <Mr_Strut> Just take the hard drive out
[3:02:40] <SiegeJay> @flyrant What is Yakuza zero?
[3:02:40] <Zinectrik> One of the main characters literally does that LUL
[3:02:44] <doofmaster> but why do people not care about them when they seem so perfectly human
[3:02:45] <hntronium> I BET THAT WOOLIE CALLING PAT OUT FOR HIS BULLSHIT
[3:02:46] <%AncelDeLambert> literally just copies
[3:02:48] <$Fenlig> Humans will eventually be the same though :D
[3:02:48] <Mr_Strut> PFFFFFT
[3:02:50] <arcaderabbit48> NO
[3:02:52] <+NightOwlSam> Only Connor, he's a prototype
[3:02:53] <CrystalDiglett> NO
[3:02:53] <element_of_loyalty> Pat is getting MUGGED
[3:02:54] <twistedj3ster> They don't have non-viotile memory because PHUCK
[3:02:55] <$Agami23> that is what htey do with connor
[3:02:56] <gyrogogozeppeli> Because racism tho
[3:02:58] <+PipIV> @pleasenameyourcharacter .... don't let it set in and relax
[3:02:58] <bambowl> @flyrant but isn't everything just tropes and cliches
[3:02:58] <+Xeno351> see then we're going into the whole SOMA thing
[3:02:59] <Graxe_> It is the best David Cage game.
[3:03:01] <Flyrant> @SiegeJay no, sorry I meant detroit
[3:03:01] <ccrida> @MelBrooksKA no it was Markus getting to know Jericho
[3:03:02] <Zinectrik> YEYEYYEYEYEYEYEYEYE
[3:03:02] <bsmusic> Pretty much
[3:03:04] <Graxe_> So that's something.
[3:03:05] <element_of_loyalty> SAVE PAT
[3:03:07] <PiGreat> OH BOY
[3:03:08] <+pleasenameyourcharacter> IT'S SETTING IN!
[3:03:11] <Wyrmsblood> Paige probably shouldn't be reading donations
[3:03:11] <mistermastergreg> Pat is dead
[3:03:12] <viviknight> 'Cause David Cage had less influence than previous games
[3:03:13] <mr_slaide> Pretty much...
[3:03:14] <chris_the_wiz_> WOULD THEY?
[3:03:15] <TezarroEX> oh god LUL
[3:03:15] <missingangle> The Kara and Alice stuff is good until the end and then you're like "oh fuck you Cage"
[3:03:16] <+cvp5127> f
[3:03:17] <dybia> They make the point that the programming errors that make up a consciousness are affected whenever Connor changes bodies
[3:03:17] <katocrimson> Good she's not invested in kara and alice
[3:03:17] <$ooblagis> Reminder that Connor's actor ad libbed most of his lines
[3:03:18] <+PipIV> @pleasenameyourcharacter apatSkelmo
[3:03:18] <CrystalDiglett> the whole game should be Connar
[3:03:19] <Ropcord> F

[3:03:33] <+Sp3ctre48> Markus starts boring, and becomes really stupid if you dont go the violence route
[3:03:33] <+nolifegamin> You're enjoying it cuz Quantic Dream did the super good job at making everything else not shit
[3:03:33] <Zinectrik> Did the old man die or did his son? didn't get to catch the vod

[3:06:17] <%ssjklyco> cheer200 The idea that robots are as strong as the average human seems like bad writing, considering they are made of stronger and better material compared to a human body which is fragile and prone to fatigue. They should be at least twice as strong as an above average person by default.

[3:12:03] <+G_Thunders> Yeah, but Kara‚Äôs an idiot.
[3:12:04] <RickSaintRiot> it would be a Slave-Catching Law or something
[3:12:05] <+FrostMass22> There are no androids in Canada, meaning they'll die the second they need parts
[3:12:05] <AlasterAngelo> how does canada elect new moose kings?
[3:12:05] <%HyperCharge_Sam> Androids aren't in Canada because they HATE ANDROIDS
[3:12:06] <element_of_loyalty> PAT SABOTAGE
[3:12:07] <%AncelDeLambert> the idea that canucks would be okay is ridiculous
[3:12:09] <HyperBomb21> But Canada is open borders! They would welcome androids
[3:12:09] <%comb711> I think the idea is that they can lay low easier

[4:03:49] <+chetasaur> thats why those are flood lights not spotlights
[4:03:50] <Kokoro_Breaker> mabey cough AN ALARM WILL GO OFF lol
[4:03:51] <Rellim80> !uptime
[4:03:53] <element_of_loyalty> JUMP
[4:03:54] <Wyrmsblood> Those lights are there because OSHA demands it
[4:03:55] <AtlasMcCoy> DONT TELL HER
[4:03:55] <dking0000> If this game was just Connor and Hank it‚Äôd be so much better
[4:03:55] <RickSaintRiot> flood lights, yeah
[4:03:55] <theobble> they need metal gear spotlights at cyberlife
[4:03:57] <IminyourBase> DO A BIG WOOLIE
[4:03:58] <%theo_marks> NO DO A WOOLIE
[4:03:58] <element_of_loyalty> KILL
[4:03:59] <DracaenaLeaf> Pat shush
[4:04:00] <CrystalDiglett> WOOLIE IS BAD
[4:04:01] <DesuDesuDokiDoki> DO IT THO
[4:04:01] <Zyquux> RUN
[4:04:01] <%SiameseSneeze> DO IT Pog
[4:04:03] <%theo_marks> BIG WOOLIE
[4:04:04] <$Sphincter_Spelunker> LUL
[4:04:04] <nekodelic> DO A WOOLIE
[4:04:04] <gyrogogozeppeli> DO A WOOLIE
[4:04:04] <TezarroEX> hehehe
[4:04:05] <Gruhunchously> Think about what Woolie would do and don't do that.
[4:04:06] <%SuichiTanaka> Woolie couldn't have known
[4:04:07] <dagreenpillow> THE COWARD ROUTE
[4:04:08] <dking0000> Kara is so nothing it‚Äôs awful
[4:04:08] <+tigerfang86> DO THE WOLLIE
[4:04:08] <+badchoice5> I honestly think this game is tailored towards Paige more than the guys
[4:04:09] <Tooniearcade> INTO THE WOOLIE HOLE
[4:04:09] <%chiluzza> Woolie smashed that button so hard
[4:04:09] <element_of_loyalty> :D
[4:04:10] <%Sinister_Aglet> good advice
[4:04:10] <+dumemoto> Dont follow any of carls
[4:04:11] <bsmusic> Do it!
[4:04:12] <+Nomicro4u> That might be a bad thing to say because Woolie failing is synonymous with him shooting people
[4:04:13] <DXLelouch24> DONT BE A COWARD
[4:04:14] <IminyourBase> BIG TIME WOOLIE GO GO GO
[4:04:15] <+Superstarsage> HAHAH
[4:04:15] <side_effect> oh man I had forgotten about that LuL
[4:04:15] <Kemmybelle> tell her after
[4:04:16] <%RaikenTB> I did too. I didn't care though cause Markus' scenario is boring.
[4:04:17] <+TheBigO75> NEVER BACK DOWN
[4:04:17] <gyrogogozeppeli> SHELL WOOLIE
[4:04:17] <%Sinister_Aglet> LUL
[4:04:18] <Kiari13> it was 100% woolie's fault
[4:04:18] <b1gboss007> Time to coward
[4:04:19] <TezarroEX> no she doesn't
[4:04:19] <element_of_loyalty> PEACH WILL KILL
[4:04:20] <%LordMoonIV> WHAT, NO SHE DOESN"T
[4:04:21] <reonome> its not like it matters LUL
[4:04:22] <+MechaBaphomet> she will run
[4:04:22] <%SaltyDongs> She's better then woolie
[4:04:22] <+CaptainJax> well know she's gonna do the woolie thinking she won't be doing the woolie
[4:04:24] <bsmusic> BE THE BIGGEST COWARD
[4:04:24] <RickSaintRiot> yeah NORMALLY, workplaces don't have spotlights
[4:04:24] <%AmericanaRed> crazy talku
[4:04:25] <+Sp3ctre48> thats a big lie
[4:04:25] <nekodelic> DON'T TELL HER
[4:04:26] <$DocMadfox> Be a BIG COWARD Paige
[4:04:28] <RickSaintRiot> unless they're prisons or something
[4:04:28] <element_of_loyalty> DRONE
[4:04:29] <+Nomicro4u> Woolie failing is akin to aggressive killing not running away
[4:04:30] <$DocMadfox> Or do a BIG MURDER
[4:04:30] <Wyrmsblood> She almost got hit by three cars
[4:04:32] <Fazziles> CRAZY TALK ACTIIVATE
[4:04:32] <$DocMadfox> Either's good
[4:04:32] <%graffitisamurai> CRAZY TALK NOOOOOOO
[4:04:33] <%AncelDeLambert> will she Woolie?
[4:04:33] <Zeikier> THEME of BACKDOWN
[4:04:34] <alrobot2014> she does better than woolie in time limited situations
[4:04:37] <theobble> simon should have been the chosen one
[4:04:38] <%LordMoonIV> SO YOU SHOULD BE WORRIED PAT
[4:04:39] <b1gboss007> DO COWARD
[4:04:39] <element_of_loyalty> CLEAVAGE
[4:04:39] <Zyquux> SEDUCE THE DRONE
[4:04:42] <Gruhunchously> Kara was the original inspiration for this game, and she ended up getting the weakest storyline.
[4:04:46] <missingangle> I honestly only care about Hank and Connor, and for Paige to see the Alice twist. By all means pull a Woolie and fuck it up bad
[4:04:47] <californaya> throw a javelin at it
[4:04:49] <+tigerfang86> I CAN SEE
[4:04:49] <Flyrant> show the drone your robo dong
[4:04:49] <$SweetCheeksTrap> How does that drone not see them?
