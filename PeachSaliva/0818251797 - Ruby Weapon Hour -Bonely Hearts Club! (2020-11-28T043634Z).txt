[0:16:56] <ghostmcfly6> Castration is chopping off balls, Spaying is taking out Ovaries. Neutering is gender neutral term. Worked at vet for much time.

[0:30:43] <+LadySaga_> that almost happened to me as well with my own new dalmatian when I was a child, he was adopted as an adult... and was a bit aggressive. It tried to bite my nose off but the chain stopped him. My parents sent him away soon after.
[0:30:43] <%Captainahab_37> Gief is cultivating so much mass
[0:30:43] <Dhurkst> Roches are god's mistake, fuck them
