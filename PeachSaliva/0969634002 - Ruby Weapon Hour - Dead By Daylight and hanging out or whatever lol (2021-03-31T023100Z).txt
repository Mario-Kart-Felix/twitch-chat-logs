[0:04:09] <Gehtingsberg> Drop gief off with pat like he’s a child LUL
[0:04:26] <$Agami23> more like light bars going up and down. cant tell if thats me
[0:04:30] <%walternatorz> it's just the spirits creeping through dimensions
[0:04:30] <+mrshazboto> Stream haunted - it's ~cinematic~
[0:04:37] <$Agami23> im seeing shadows and lights in waves
[0:04:39] <@SoFarFetched> yeah we can mess around with your camera set up when you get back home.
[0:04:45] <%SpaghettiTime44> There's something about english bulldogs' silhouette that's intimidating despite their size

[0:06:16] <%walternatorz> I can't make out the expiration date on that mustard.
[0:06:18] <%JoshManVGH> I like that it's specifically the Spooky Ghost, cause it could imply that there is like a Reasonable Ghost of Abe Lincoln.
[0:06:19] <+garagon31> Did she just pull up her coveralls?
[0:06:19] <+Fooguwu> Crate training is a great way to make a dog think "if I chew on this, that is the signal to go to my crate". It's not a punishment, they just learn it as "oh don't signal things i don't necessarily want"
[0:06:20] <boomstickery> my little JRT loved her crate btu outgrew the need for it
[0:06:23] <dagreenpillow> Do u call Zangief Pee pee too? o;

[0:14:32] <scott_greatest> as far as I can tell
[0:14:33] <@SoFarFetched> Thats okay for now. We just won't see your perks.
[0:14:38] <Calek> 500% too small
[0:14:38] <LanHikari64> wheres elbo
[0:14:39] <Zeif00> SeemsGood
[0:14:45] <@SoFarFetched> Cause Perks are bottom right.
[0:14:50] <%PrincessAlex23> Paige you're not too large, you're perfect JUST THE WAY YOU ARE lol
[0:14:52] <$DarkNerdShawny> Buy a green screen
[0:14:59] <%sonlascivious> hard game to avoid covering anything tho
[0:15:04] <%sumrand0> @vexicbayn ah yes the perennial "kpop knife" the thing all kpop stars carry..
[0:15:04] <freelancebabymaker> this game doesnt really seem to have a good corner for the camera honestly
[0:15:07] <$Weeabooninja> You must become GIANT
[0:15:07] <+MooseIsGoose> your good
[0:15:17] <%sumrand0> @vexicbayn lol thats a little silly
[0:15:18] <@SoFarFetched> Only other possibility is if you just lay your camera above your perks,but with your layout it might be awkward.
[0:15:30] <%sumrand0> @vexicbayn but thanks for the info
[0:15:42] <@SoFarFetched> So that Way its not only above your perks,you can block after game chat if they say swear words.
[0:15:42] <mike2hands> damm that girl is thicc
[0:15:52] <%bassoontyphoon> I love Elodie's character design
[0:15:53] <+EyeFarted> Place yourself center screen
[0:15:56] <+oddodongh> like, a kitty kat?
[0:15:56] <$DarkNerdShawny> This game isnt even about killers anymore, its about the FASION!
[0:15:57] <@SoFarFetched> UnBreakable?
[0:16:00] <@SoFarFetched> They alive damnit
[0:16:08] <%sumrand0> Salty Tongues those were a thing at one point right?
[0:16:10] <+Noahccountingfortaste> @PeachSaliva premonition?
[0:16:12] <@SoFarFetched> oh I think I know which one
[0:16:32] <%bassoontyphoon> no inventory??
[0:16:33] <@SoFarFetched> You mean Feng Min's Alert when a killer br eaks a pallet and stuff?
[0:16:34] <$Trenr> When the killer breaks stuff, he's revealed? Alert I think
[0:16:36] <CrimsonFox777> Those are called ears. Kappa
[0:16:41] <+oddodongh> "yay, I'm scared" is not a sentece you hear often
[0:16:47] <%SpaghettiTime44> I found out someone I went to Middle and High school with used to work at Tree House Animal Foundation! I thought the name sounded familiar when you mentioned it before
[0:16:51] <%Shinpoki> Pffft spine chill is for pros sipsipHellmo
[0:17:04] <@SoFarFetched> Yeah there is
[0:17:06] <%sumrand0> usually
[0:17:12] <%Nox_Ludicro> First few times, yeah
[0:17:12] <@SoFarFetched> Spine Chill and Kindred are my favorite
[0:17:15] <+oddodongh> WIth urban evasion I think it's pretty fantastic
[0:17:16] <+Noahccountingfortaste> spine chill IS for pros
[0:17:21] <@SoFarFetched> Kindred lets me judge others for leaving me on the hook geefBruh
[0:17:31] <+chiazam> Oh my god it feels like forever since I've seen Paige on camera
[0:17:34] <@SoFarFetched> HOIVES
[0:17:40] <%sonlascivious> nothing new lmao
[0:17:41] <%sumrand0> Of course you are Temmy
[0:17:41] <@SoFarFetched> @SpaghettiTime44 oh shit thats neat to find out!
[0:17:42] <Ell1ot> i got a sun rash today
[0:17:46] <Ell1ot> it sucks
[0:17:46] <%Nox_Ludicro> I had to wean myself off spine chill, since I was too dependent on it.
[0:17:47] <scott_greatest> Is the mustard for treating the hives?
[0:17:47] <rosencruez> oh no, hives!
[0:17:48] <freelancebabymaker> were used to it worm girl
[0:17:53] <%SpaghettiTime44> @SoFarFetched I thought so!
[0:17:53] <Gehtingsberg> oh no I hate that, stress hives or?
[0:18:01] <LanHikari64> oh no i hate bees
[0:18:01] <$Sphincter_Spelunker> no wonder you hate bees
[0:18:08] <%sumrand0> Paige is allegic to herself
[0:18:11] <Coystick> Peach "Bee Hive" Saliva
[0:18:16] <%bassoontyphoon> detergent hives??
[0:18:27] <%sonlascivious> I remember watching your bloodborne streams and you always having hives or a fever
[0:18:40] <$Weeabooninja> These the Uterus defense bee hives?
[0:18:42] <+chiazam> Master Survivor Paige is on the case
[0:18:50] <%Nox_Ludicro> Paige is the most immersed survivor I've ever seen and It's entertaining AF
[0:18:52] <%SpaghettiTime44> Man, I remember EARLY Paige streams, I think I caught her second Sonic High School stream on Periscope
[0:18:54] <%sumrand0> @sonlascivious those were her "powered up state"
[0:19:11] <%sumrand0> Thats WHY we watch u hahahahaha
[0:19:24] <LanHikari64> do you make that disclaimer before every game
[0:19:25] <%Nox_Ludicro> "immersed" is the nice way of saying "bad" <3 <3 <3
[0:19:27] <+Noahccountingfortaste> oh, trapper
[0:19:28] <+Noahccountingfortaste> cool
[0:19:31] <@SoFarFetched> fuck LUL
[0:19:33] <+chiazam> I think you're very "experienced" Paige, which is pretty good honestly
[0:19:34] <@SoFarFetched> that was a yell
[0:19:43] <%bassoontyphoon> damn girl what kind of scream???
[0:19:44] <+oddodongh> lol i thought it was the killer for a second
[0:19:48] <+oddodongh> i haven't played in awhile
[0:19:53] <@SoFarFetched> Elodie's scream is SUPER screamy for some reason
[0:19:58] <@SoFarFetched> like it startles me at times
[0:20:08] <@Jekado> i miss the car noises the generators make
[0:20:08] <Ell1ot> no
[0:20:11] <$Sphincter_Spelunker> the OG?
[0:20:13] <@Jekado> which version paige?
[0:20:14] <%SpaghettiTime44> I think Jenna missed every Skill Check she did when she played
[0:20:15] <@Jekado> i saw both
[0:20:20] <@Jekado> well both movie versions
[0:20:23] <Gehtingsberg> I did live in San DIego
[0:20:34] <marvel877> just the remake, not the original.
[0:20:38] <@SoFarFetched> @SpaghettiTime44 I missed most of the gameplay for that and only joined in the later second game LUL
[0:20:45] <%SpaghettiTime44> I saw the newer film version of the Producers
[0:20:59] <@Jekado> the original is pretty good too i would say watch both
[0:21:04] <+Jonny_Worldbeater> Not the musical, but saw the movie based on the musical
[0:21:05] <%sumrand0> Didn't know the name of it but I thought "The Producers" was the same as "The Aristocrats" joke.....BOY THEY ARE NOT THE SAME
[0:21:12] <+STFUDruid> dear lord peach in HD
[0:21:25] <%sonlascivious> thats new
[0:21:30] <%SpaghettiTime44> I saw the matthew broderick one

[0:21:38] <scott_greatest> good hiding
[0:21:40] <+Noahccountingfortaste> this trapper is giving me serious NOED vibes
[0:21:43] <+chiazam> Good one
[0:21:54] <CrimsonFox777> Oh it's the Trapper. Thought I heard Clown coughing earlier.
[0:21:55] <@SoFarFetched> I leveled up the trickster to at least 35 with my mil of blood points.
[0:22:01] <+Soliloquy123> Elodie is not having a good time
[0:22:05] <$Sphincter_Spelunker> it ain't a PeachSaliva stream without tits and balls
[0:22:09] <%Nox_Ludicro> NOED almost guaranteed with a killer this bad.
[0:22:35] <@SoFarFetched> was half expecting paige to stab elodie by accident LUL

[0:27:48] <%SpaghettiTime44> BIG AND STRONG
[0:27:51] <WanderingYoren> feel like I would never want to play anyone else
[0:27:51] <@SoFarFetched> yeah rank 19
[0:27:54] <comicalmond9135> doodSurvive doodSurvive
[0:27:55] <%sonlascivious> you can't help it you were good lmao
[0:27:56] <%maskofmichael> you killed them
[0:27:58] <%Carquar> What is NOED?
[0:28:03] <%EyeFarted> STREAM OVER
[0:28:06] <+Noahccountingfortaste> against NOED? You did the right thing
[0:28:06] <+mrshazboto> But you won though. Climb on their bodies for success
[0:28:12] <+oddodongh> No one escapes death. When gates are avaliable, attacks down in 1 hit.
[0:28:13] <@SoFarFetched> check your killers paige to see
[0:28:14] <%bassoontyphoon> yes
[0:28:20] <emper0rner0> These are low rank players that don't have new stuff prob
[0:28:21] <hananafell> You wouldnt be able to play if you didnt
[0:28:21] <mike2hands> i use my friends as steppingstones to victory HOORAY
[0:28:31] <%bluetocho13> its fine to leave your friends when the killer has noed
[0:28:38] <%Nox_Ludicro> @Carquar No One Escapes Death, it's a killer perk that makes people go down in one hit once all the generators are done.
[0:28:41] <+Noahccountingfortaste> the background implies you have the new patch
[0:28:41] <CrimsonFox777> @Carquar No One Escapes Death. It's a perk that activates once the last generator is done. It gives the killer a speed buff and let's them one-hit survivors.
[0:28:43] <%Shinpoki> Strong start! You avoided him so damn well :O
[0:28:50] <%bluetocho13> i would be more mad at you if you tried to save me with noed in play
[0:29:13] <%Carquar> @Nox_ludicro @CrimsonFox777 Oh that sounds super lame. Thanks for the explanation!
[0:29:20] <deathygz> i hope that lobby background is a map soon
[0:29:31] <@SoFarFetched> @Carquar yeah some people in the DbD use is as a Crutch perk and rely on it to get their kills instead of getting better.
[0:29:36] <%Nox_Ludicro> @Carquar It's a hex perk, meaning it's tied to a little skull totem when active.  Cleansing the totem removes the perk from the game entireley
[0:29:37] <@SoFarFetched> no new map yet
[0:29:39] <emper0rner0> He doesnt have one
[0:29:40] <%sonlascivious> he didnt get one
[0:29:41] <@SoFarFetched> they said they want to focus on remaking old maps first.
[0:29:42] <%Nox_Ludicro> No map for the new killer
[0:29:43] <+Soliloquy123> There isn't one
[0:29:43] <@SoFarFetched> then do new maps
[0:29:50] <hananafell> The only reason to stay when NOED pops is if you SEE the totem it's on
[0:29:53] <%Nox_Ludicro> They've been focused on redoing old maps first
[0:29:53] <@SoFarFetched> So probably down the line we will get his map
[0:29:57] <@SoFarFetched> when they finish doing the old ones
[0:30:01] <Sogeki_Dan> they ever add ultra wide monitor support yet? can't play the game unless I hook up an old monitor
[0:30:14] <emper0rner0> The devs said they are open to making a map based on this background
[0:30:15] <WanderingYoren> I think Henry Winkler should be the next killer
[0:30:26] <Kaleidoscope_Misfortune> they added color blind mode tho
[0:30:31] <@SoFarFetched> dont think they added ultrawide  yet
[0:30:34] <%Chichen> do it
[0:30:34] <%Ranryu692> help I ate too much McDonald's and now I want to die
[0:30:39] <%SpaghettiTime44> I was literally thinking "I'm so hungry" right when you said that

[0:30:43] <+alternative_flu> Mood
[0:30:43] <deathygz> i crave a sausage egg mcmuffin every morning
[0:30:45] <@SoFarFetched> Paige don't stress out too much.
[0:30:46] <%Carquar> @Nox_ludicro Interesting, okay. I've played DBD but not enough to be really familiar. My friends and I were terrible.
[0:30:53] <LanHikari64> @wanderingyoren wilford brimley would be better
[0:30:53] <@SoFarFetched> TITTIES
[0:30:55] <@SoFarFetched> oh

[0:35:49] <scott_greatest> father time
[0:35:50] <+Shockrates20XX> I think your teammate has Inner Strength. Looked like she healed in the locker. Might leave those dull totems for her.

[1:13:09] <%SpaghettiTime44> who doesn't love a good hamburger?
[1:13:11] <+BigCoffee> I see Paige is now a food streamer!
[1:13:15] <+BigCoffee> Canadian mukbang
[1:13:15] <+theenigmaticdude> so now its a mukbang
[1:13:15] <%sumrand0> u also eat every stream and have associated streaming with eating
[1:13:24] <%SveriSageAdvice> oh so thats what the door was on Pat's stream, the doordash
[1:13:27] <@SoFarFetched> Yeah you can probably enter them when you're done eating.
[1:13:30] <graemecrackers2> No worms?
[1:13:33] <TurtlesAndTentacles> Paige use to swim? But you seem...uncoordinated. Are you like Hancock?
[1:13:36] <+Caboose2492> I want McDonald's now....
[1:13:36] <%sumrand0> no judgements but thats how behaviors form
[1:13:38] <+BigCoffee> Be strong other coffee
[1:13:42] <+infeliciter> @PeachSaliva Do you not like cheeburg?
[1:13:43] <+chiazam> Is that WcDonalds?
[1:13:45] <$Sphincter_Spelunker> @TurtlesAndTentacles it's the lupus that did that
[1:13:45] <%sumrand0> MOST
[1:13:50] <@SoFarFetched> Paige forgets to eat during streams at times.
[1:13:54] <%sumrand0> No judgements
[1:13:56] <MarylandJutsu> nah its all good
[1:13:58] <%sleepy_coffee> I survived but the dang lady does no shows and it borked my sleep schedule\
[1:14:02] <%the_super_suit> pat just posted balls on stream
[1:14:09] <%Nox_Ludicro> Also I cannot DM you, Twitter says "no".
[1:14:09] <+BigCoffee> What's your take on A&W ? And have you tried DicAnns here?
[1:14:13] <MarylandJutsu> american cheese on a hamburger is an atrocity
[1:14:14] <%sleepy_coffee> sleepy_coffee gifted a Tier 1 sub to BigCoffee! They have given 4 Gift Subs in the channel! 
[1:14:16] <%SpaghettiTime44> Oh my god, making streamers eat can be so frustrating, as someone who mods a few channels
[1:14:16] <+garagon31> I used to get those 4 inch round kids' subs from the Subway after swimming lessons
[1:14:17] <PleaseCallMeSugar> american cheese is nasty
[1:14:22] <@SoFarFetched> @Nox_ludicro I messaged her the codes SeemsGood
[1:14:23] <+Jolnir> ewww gross
[1:14:25] <%BigCoffee> @sleepy_coffee Thanks friendly coffee
[1:14:34] <%BigCoffee> <3
[1:14:35] <+callmeflippy> forget dbd, order more mcdanks
[1:14:36] <%sleepy_coffee> ye, enjoy
[1:14:36] <PleaseCallMeSugar> mcdonald's had better cheese with their fancy burgers for a while, a big mac with cheddar fucking slaps
[1:14:37] <BaronVonProlix> american cheese is a crime
[1:14:37] <nipplestheenchilada96> american cheese is doodoo in all applications
[1:14:39] <%Nox_Ludicro> @SoFarFetched Thank you! eyyohbHeart
[1:14:41] <+SoySocks> kraft is gross, but even real american cheese isn't very good
[1:14:41] <madilynboyd> American cheese is a lie
[1:14:41] <MarylandJutsu> any other cheese on a burger is fine, american is a no
[1:14:42] <%sumrand0> But Ive been binging your VODs so maybe I'm overly familiar with old streams cant wait for Delta Rune Chapt 2!!!!
[1:14:43] <TurtlesAndTentacles> i do....
[1:14:43] <+Caboose2492> the shitty American cheese makes a McDonald's cheeseburger
[1:14:44] <+realm_forge> Question: Is a ketogenic diet good for lupus?
[1:14:48] <+chiazam> American cheese is the best cheese for burgers
[1:14:50] <%BigCoffee> I too love myself
[1:14:54] <%walternatorz> the only thing you can do with american cheese is put it on burgers, everything else is a sin
[1:14:54] <%CantWalkGood> Have you seen the Burger Scholar on First We Feast?
[1:15:01] <%BinaryFireball> american cheese is ok, never good
[1:15:06] <MarylandJutsu> 5 years at least
[1:15:09] <PleaseCallMeSugar> good ol government cheese
[1:15:10] <%SpaghettiTime44> has anything been said about it?
[1:15:11] <%BigCoffee> How many years was it since he said 7 years%
[1:15:11] <$Agami23> im not a big burger lady myself.
[1:15:12] <DedlokPM> Oh. So THIS is why Pat had to answer the door. rooVV
[1:15:12] <%BigCoffee> 2?
[1:15:14] <+GTsunamii> i miss papyrus i love him
[1:15:15] <+maffewsus> what's up Peach? haven't tuned in for a while, loving the new set up
[1:15:17] <+SoySocks> muenster is my favorite melty sandwich cheese
[1:15:24] <Piemono> Which will come first, the next GoT book, or Delta RUne
[1:15:24] <%sumrand0> You know your favorite boi will be there and Toby has stated chapt 2 is 80% done now
[1:15:26] <PleaseCallMeSugar> muenster is sex
[1:15:26] <+chiazam> I hope Toby's okay in his work-hole
[1:15:27] <graemecrackers2> Do you have a fav strain of weed Paige  ?
[1:15:28] <$Chatterbox1991> Paige i sent you a couple of recommends for podcast earlier, you catch them?
[1:15:29] <%sumrand0> 1 year maybe
[1:15:31] <+MayorRev> how's your day going?
[1:15:31] <MarylandJutsu> Paige kicks down the door: WHERE IS PAPYRUS?!?! GIVE HIM TO ME
[1:15:32] <$Chatterbox1991> on Twitter?
[1:15:36] <phantomsleeves> i like your shirt paige!
[1:15:42] <%SpaghettiTime44> muenster is a great sandwich cheese! @SoySocks
[1:15:42] <%cactus_gato> I haven't had mcdonald's in forever, I just had dinner now I want burger,,,,
[1:15:44] <%Wiiplayah43> American cheese is good if you're eating a greaseball burger.
[1:15:46] <%bassoontyphoon> If you like Deltarune/Undertale, have you considered playing OMORI???
[1:15:52] <%maskofmichael> 1000 years
[1:15:54] <%sumrand0> Paige should try CBD if you havnt
[1:15:54] <+toastybites> Pink is a good strain
[1:16:02] <Ell1ot> same!
[1:16:03] <%BigCoffee> It's kinda wild now that you have a fancy close up cam, vs pat's crummy cam, but you are extremely expressive with your hands Peach
[1:16:05] <MarylandJutsu> smoking?
[1:16:06] <+Noahccountingfortaste> partaking?
[1:16:06] <PleaseCallMeSugar> partaking? consuming?
[1:16:07] <%alternative_flu> We should make a new strain based off you and call it Peach Sativa
[1:16:07] <TurtlesAndTentacles> Get that PURP
[1:16:12] <%ospreyworks> partaking?
[1:16:14] <DedlokPM> partake
[1:16:17] <%sumrand0> CBD oil The non high THC
[1:16:19] <bradley1990> that burger looks awful
[1:16:20] <graemecrackers2> Sure
[1:16:24] <$Sphincter_Spelunker> PeachSaliva, not Peach Salvia
[1:16:25] <%superc37> omoris a p long game tho, so i doubt she'll have time to play it
[1:16:36] <+GTsunamii> also paige ur overalls are super cute!
[1:16:46] <ofmiceandmenn> So now it's not illegal and you can use crack anytime you want ?
[1:16:46] <@SoFarFetched> look some of us have our favorite garbage food.
[1:16:47] <%alternative_flu> Some garbage is ok
[1:16:47] <Ell1ot> i used it twice to get rid of my annual migraine
[1:16:48] <+egalitarian696969> looks like someone made it at 11:30
[1:16:50] <@SoFarFetched> its our guilty pleasure
[1:16:50] <%sumrand0> helps with physical pain in persistent ailments for a lot of stuff
[1:16:54] <%walternatorz> I believe imbibing is specific to drinks
[1:16:55] <%BinaryFireball> is mcd's your favorite buger place?
[1:16:55] <+infeliciter> @PeachSaliva You seem like a sativa person
[1:16:59] <WanderingYoren> the shittier it looks the better it tastes
[1:17:00] <+mrshazboto> Has MacRowlands offered a sponsorship yet?
[1:17:00] <PleaseCallMeSugar> let us partake in communion, and feast upon the stank weed
[1:17:00] <%Nox_Ludicro> When has McDonald's ever been about aesthetics, though?
[1:17:01] <%BinaryFireball> or just the most conveniant?
[1:17:03] <%SpaghettiTime44> I managed a dispensary for 2 years, I feel like I know TOO much
[1:17:05] <%sumrand0> CBD wont get you "High"
[1:17:17] <+egalitarian696969> sleep paralysis demon?
[1:17:23] <+Kinoskae> Sounds like Gorilla Glue
[1:17:24] <%BigCoffee> sleep paralysis angel
[1:17:25] <+toastybites> love that shit
[1:17:30] <%walternatorz> gravity training chamber
[1:17:33] <+infeliciter> @PeachSaliva Thats is indica that does couch lock
[1:17:33] <nipplestheenchilada96> is that subscribe banner supposed to look like a sonic outfit or a onesie or something? because it looks like you are literally inside sonic wearing him as a suit
[1:17:34] <%BigCoffee> SQDC
[1:17:36] <%SpaghettiTime44> See, I can't NOT have the body high, I don't notice it otherwise
[1:17:43] <PleaseCallMeSugar> ah, narc weed
[1:17:44] <madilynboyd> CBD doesnt do enough for me, though I dont like the high
[1:17:46] <Ell1ot> don't you only fall asleep with a pillow on your head because of the weight?
[1:17:49] <+Desperado_Dave> Wow! I've never seen your set up. looks good so far :D
[1:17:58] <%VexicBayn> good ol gobberment weeds
[1:18:08] <%sumrand0> Pats weed is my kinda weed Im in Massachusetts so we have recreational/med dispensaries everywhere now its awesome and really well run
[1:18:13] <%VexicBayn> the devils lettuce but it's got a tax stamp
[1:18:13] <rearedlogarithm> Is it because it feels like Abraham Lincoln is getting you high?
[1:18:21] <emper0rner0> Getting too high is more anxious than relaxing
[1:18:31] <%BinaryFireball> weed store people are so nice
[1:18:44] <+Kinoskae> I get the munchies so bad when I'm high
[1:18:56] <ofmiceandmenn> So a psychopath drug that turns you to joker.
[1:19:04] <WanderingYoren> I want to try cocaine but I hear that's a bad idea
[1:19:06] <%walternatorz> aurora or mcdonald's ? what do you enjoy more?
[1:19:08] <%SpaghettiTime44> I love helping people find strains that work for them, it's always super rewarding to see them come back and say how much they liked what you recommended
[1:19:09] <graemecrackers2> That's nice for you Paige
[1:19:12] <%Marg0Pol0> There is a dispensary I go to that gave me some stuff for me to sleep, and it was like I sunk into the bed so hard it felt like the mattress and I were one.
[1:19:15] <%alternative_flu> How would you feel if there a strain named after you? It would be called PeachSativa
[1:19:17] <PleaseCallMeSugar> imagine... aurora AND mcdonald's
[1:19:19] <%sumrand0> The trick is to slowly increase dosage otherwise you risk accidentally taking more than you're used to
[1:19:22] <%BigCoffee> I need to find 1 to relax and 1 for the comedy high. I have weed oil and chocolate right now, and they both do a third effect, last like 5 hours, and I can't use them with others
[1:19:26] <$Sphincter_Spelunker> @WanderingYoren cmonBruh we ain't talking about hard drugs, dude
[1:19:35] <fearhurst> mcdonalds BAD
[1:19:37] <%AncelDeLambert> How is Pat still going
[1:19:38] <+BusterRepukken> whens the mcdonalds sponsorship
[1:19:39] <WanderingYoren> it turns you into BANE
[1:19:42] <%sumrand0> Weedonalds
[1:19:42] <%Marg0Pol0> Why not both
[1:19:42] <HoldBtoRun> weed WITH mcdonalds
[1:19:45] <%AncelDeLambert> also hey gorl wattup
[1:19:46] <+infeliciter> @PeachSaliva I feel you
[1:19:48] <%BigCoffee> giggling like a hyena is LCD psaDogchamp
[1:19:48] <%bassoontyphoon> hweed*
[1:19:49] <Ivyna_J_Spyder> Man I wish I had a job where I could try weed at least once legally lol
[1:19:51] <+alternative_flu> Munchies tho
[1:19:53] <+Kinoskae> WeeDonalds
[1:19:53] <SaphronBlackbourne> Paige do we live in a society
[1:19:55] <%Nox_Ludicro> Fry your fries in WEED OIL
[1:19:55] <Oxybe> for me the strain that helps me relax after work or a stressful day is Sensei Star.

[1:20:13] <%maskofmichael> Weed Donalds
[1:20:13] <%sumrand0> Potdonalds or McMarijuana
[1:20:17] <%SpaghettiTime44> food is important

[1:20:32] <%AncelDeLambert> Taco Bell sucks, tho
[1:20:36] <MarylandJutsu> Paige can't have balls in her ass if she doesn't have dinner first
[1:20:37] <+Noahccountingfortaste> Get any good recommendations for your long road trip?

[1:20:44] <$Sphincter_Spelunker> I can make better than Taco Bell, and that upsets me
[1:20:48] <HoldBtoRun> Taco Bell hits when you're fucked up
[1:20:50] <%SpaghettiTime44> It's below F, I think
[1:20:52] <%AncelDeLambert> yeah, but Quebec is insane
[1:20:55] <+toastybites> Taco Bell is for 3am sadness
[1:20:55] <%walternatorz> I enjoy saw dust meat.
[1:20:56] <madilynboyd> Taco Bell is pretty gross
[1:21:00] <+Kinoskae> horse meat
[1:21:01] <%BigCoffee> As a fan of the borglars, have you tried our burgers unique to montreal/canada? Like A&W, DicAnns and Belle Province?
[1:21:01] <%sumrand0> Is clapping after a plane lands an international sort of "ritual"
[1:21:02] <ofmiceandmenn> What are you hiding under all that ?
[1:21:04] <%Nox_Ludicro> Taco Bell took away my quesaritos and I've not been back since
[1:21:04] <%cactus_gato> I want that cheddar cheese chalupa
[1:21:04] <%the_super_suit> what's your opinion on panda express
[1:21:05] <%bassoontyphoon> Dont you mean a "Chez Taco Bell"
[1:21:05] <PleaseCallMeSugar> their meat and cheese quality is just. terrifyingly low
[1:21:11] <+fromnibelheim> I  waited years for the quesalupa to come back. that's the only thing I need from taco bell but I do need it
[1:21:14] <%BigCoffee> taco bell isnt food
[1:21:15] <%AncelDeLambert> LUL
[1:21:16] <+realm_forge> It’s lower than dog food
[1:21:17] <%BigCoffee> I'm sorry americans
[1:21:21] <+Desperado_Dave> Yooooo we just ordered Taco Bell, too!
[1:21:21] <@SoFarFetched> Theres a couple of Taco Bells in canada
[1:21:22] <PleaseCallMeSugar> iirc taco bell meat is some shit like 60% gluten filler
[1:21:24] <@SoFarFetched> but not a lot
[1:21:25] <%JoshManVGH> Yeah, but taco bell has or had sand meat
[1:21:27] <nipplestheenchilada96> australia got taco bell not long ago, its actually so good

[1:21:51] <MarylandJutsu> Quebec has...some standards
[1:21:53] <%AncelDeLambert> I believe what it had was SILICON at a certain level, which was to prevent clumping or something
[1:21:54] <+mrshazboto> I thought subway was cake
[1:21:56] <TurtlesAndTentacles> I wanna be high right now...

[1:22:22] <+theenigmaticdude> pat screaming in the background
[1:22:23] <%bassoontyphoon> Instead of formaldehyde, be embalmed with mustard and big mac sauce
[1:22:23] <@SoFarFetched> Paige will NEVER become the skeleton.
[1:22:23] <+chiazam> I prefer the Double Quarter Pounder myself, its the biggest one
[1:22:28] <PleaseCallMeSugar> god mcdoubles are so fucking good
[1:22:29] <+realm_forge> I haven’t eaten fast food in about 8 years
[1:22:29] <HoldBtoRun> wrappers might bond to your skeleton and bring you back to life
[1:22:31] <emper0rner0> Watching you eat has made me so hungry
[1:22:31] <%walternatorz> Paige will be perfectly preserved for science.
[1:22:33] <+Noahccountingfortaste> So you want to rest in the Mcmausoleum?
[1:22:34] <@SoFarFetched> "butt fuck it" got it
[1:22:36] <%BigCoffee> You know the saying right? Good people leave early, meaning bad people live forever
[1:22:38] <+BusterRepukken> theyll crack open your coffin and marvel at the preservation because your cells are Mcdonalds infused
[1:22:42] <%bassoontyphoon> Why are fat asses a negative though??

[1:28:00] <antimatter_man> Delicious
[1:28:06] <+realm_forge> That was seamless. Good job peach!
[1:28:06] <aiutare47> Not to sound impolite but I'm kinda curious, why overlap the streams? Wouldn't it be most efficient to stagger so you and Pat both maximize viewers? @PeachSaliva
[1:28:07] <%sumrand0> Elmo Spores
[1:28:07] <MarylandJutsu> Elmo INFECTS ALL
[1:28:08] <+apocplz> cat spores
[1:28:11] <%SpaghettiTime44> he's a mushroom now?
[1:28:12] <theshillman> what if you vacuumed him?
[1:28:14] <%linSP> the elmo virus..
[1:28:17] <%bassoontyphoon> Toxiplasmosis yum
[1:28:17] <Psyramics> that's the toxoplasmosis
[1:28:19] <blackbookalpha> Toxoplasmosis in effect
[1:28:20] <%walternatorz> how else is he going to repopulate his species?
[1:28:20] <%sumrand0> Always Heads been
[1:28:21] <TheBensonator_> Elmo Brain is a new medical condition confirmed
[1:28:21] <Ell1ot> when is elmo haircut?
[1:28:22] <@PlagueOfGripes> the queue times in the morning are super fast
[1:28:23] <karovus> that would explain a lot
[1:28:25] <+RealThiele> so thats how he reproduces
[1:28:26] <%SpaghettiTime44> first he's the reason you do badly in DBD, but now he's a mushroom
[1:28:31] <+Ynkubus_> Ohno, an Elmothid
[1:28:32] <blaggablag> toxoelmosis
[1:28:34] <Lodestarrobot> the statistics
[1:28:34] <+RealThiele> paige wants to be her own person
[1:28:35] <%firewhiskeys> cordycelmo
[1:28:36] <MarylandJutsu> halloooo eliiiiii
[1:28:38] <+red_cuppa> like a Coward, as paige had said
[1:28:39] <TheBensonator_> psaBig VIEW COUNT
[1:28:39] <SaphronBlackbourne> Welcome to the family nya
[1:28:42] <Visorak6> If paige wanted to maximize viewers itd be very obvious LUL
[1:28:43] <WanderingYoren> Elmo is the heart of the swarm
[1:28:46] <+realm_forge> BECAUSE FUCK PAT
[1:28:49] <PleaseCallMeSugar> it's more satisfying if everyone chose her over pat obviously
[1:28:51] <theshillman> The Elm Of Us
[1:28:56] <$QuesoFM> paige vs pat! paige vs pat! paige vs pat!
[1:29:00] <%skyentombment> Hey Peaches, I got a question: With the change in scenery, will the beatoffability of the stream change?
[1:29:01] <%ospreyworks> sometimes, I'm in more of a peachstream mode
[1:29:03] <%sumrand0> Paige is streaming 4 her peopo while she CAN we'll be excited when you're back too
[1:29:05] <+realm_forge> PAIGE IS WAY MORE ENTERTAINING
[1:29:07] <+Jiggisnipe> Paige rarely streams, I doubt she cares about metrics
[1:29:08] <nipplestheenchilada96> its out of absolute spite to steal pats views
[1:29:13] <antimatter_man> Eh, you gotta start at some point and hes taking most of the day?
[1:29:16] <@SoFarFetched> You can watch either OR watch both
[1:29:18] <WanderingYoren> Paige plays Starcraft when
[1:29:20] <theshillman> separate the simps from the gamers
[1:29:20] <+whyskeywolfe> Hey you're taking viewers away from Markiplier too, so you know; nice work!
[1:29:20] <+RealThiele> its all the same color money
[1:29:21] <%SpaghettiTime44> Paige streams are rarer
[1:29:21] <%maskofmichael> as long as we give you money lol
[1:29:21] <$thomassolorio> pat got thar donk
[1:29:23] <Khester824> i was watching both!
[1:29:24] <antimatter_man> Its gotta happen this way
[1:29:28] <%sumrand0> I LOVE IT
[1:29:31] <aiutare47> Damn, what an oddly wholesome answer.
[1:29:34] <%sumrand0> Hahahaha
[1:29:36] <+riderstrike152> Serious question? Can Pat roll into a ball like Sonic? I feel like he could do it.
[1:29:41] <%Pilzkun> The trick is multiple monitors
[1:29:41] <MarylandJutsu> interrupt his stream with an elmo only stream
[1:29:42] <critiquequartz> i feel like your streams are so rare getting 2 back to back is a treat
[1:29:45] <%Wiiplayah43> Paige streams for fun, not for a living.
[1:29:47] <PleaseCallMeSugar> he can but chooses not to
[1:29:49] <%SpaghettiTime44> Paige streams are rarer, and therefore more precious
[1:29:49] <%Pilzkun> we can watch both of you at once
[1:29:50] <dynamitedoki> U and pat our my wife and Is favorite online couple. U guys are adorable and congrats again on your Engagement
[1:29:51] <%Pilzkun> pro strats
[1:29:52] <%sumrand0> Who gets chat in the custody battle?
[1:29:57] <%Nox_Ludicro> Should channel category be updated?
[1:30:03] <$QuesoFM> this is what marriage is Paige, a constant struggle for more viewers. strike him down
[1:30:07] <%walternatorz> paige isn't mean to chat
[1:30:11] <Daxalog> Does this game hurt your wrists?
[1:30:11] <+slickrick1121> lol wait where are you streaming? is that a pelaton? cool!
[1:30:11] <themightypuffs> So umm when did McDonald's stop serving breakfast all day?

[1:30:20] <rekinom> Yoooo, camera is nice and smooth!
[1:30:21] <emper0rner0> Since COVID
[1:30:22] <%sumrand0> I dont wanna go to dads he plays fortnite nowwww
[1:30:23] <SaphronBlackbourne> Oh i feel like I should tell you you are the reason I did a reading of all of Sonic High School to my friends
[1:30:25] <PleaseCallMeSugar> the judge would award custody of chat to paige because she treats us better
[1:30:28] <$Sphincter_Spelunker> @rekinom when it works
[1:30:31] <$thomassolorio> in bare assing
[1:30:43] <silverira> hey Paige how are you doing? and where are you streaming from?
[1:30:49] <DreTPK> She's asserting her dominance ass the sigma fuckboivan
[1:30:49] <nipplestheenchilada96> when does this just become a mcdonalds mukbang stream
[1:31:06] <TheBensonator_> What camera are you using @PeachSaliva ? Looks GREAT!
[1:31:21] <MarylandJutsu> Allright Chat whcih killer we thinkking/
[1:31:24] <MarylandJutsu> thinking?
[1:31:28] <%the_super_suit> doctor
[1:31:33] <MarylandJutsu> Huntress is my guess
[1:31:38] <SaphronBlackbourne> Huntress
[1:31:39] <TheBensonator_> A FINE choice!
[1:31:50] <%bassoontyphoon> knifey kpop man
[1:31:52] <%SpaghettiTime44> I believe that's what Jenna uses
[1:31:59] <augusta_wind> what lip color?
[1:31:59] <%TheWinged7> @PeachSaliva those sony cams are still notorious for overheating even once you fix the battery problem
[1:32:03] <%sumrand0> Label these streams "Performance Art" and they'd win awards IDK y but thats how art works
[1:32:12] <WanderingYoren> so do you only play survivors ms Paige?
[1:32:16] <PleaseCallMeSugar> time to watercool it
[1:32:23] <MarylandJutsu> yeah she plays surviovrs while Pat likes killers
[1:32:27] <%alternative_flu> Try covering it in bags of ice
[1:32:29] <theshillman> bye bye
[1:32:32] <critiquequartz> maybe its a voltage problem
[1:32:46] <TheBensonator_> @PleaseCallMeSugar *Linus intensifies*
[1:32:49] <@PlagueOfGripes> Paige why don't you brush this explosively shedding cat
[1:32:51] <Ell1ot> i finally see the light thing everyone's been talking about. it looks like a CRT thing
[1:33:08] <MarylandJutsu> one does not simply brush elmo
[1:33:18] <MarylandJutsu> i think thats billy?
[1:33:18] <%skyentombment> @alternative_flu and because it's Peaches camera, it's gonna say "Why is this ice bag so cold?"
[1:33:22] <MarylandJutsu> or is it leatherface?
[1:33:27] <%ShockzNDrawe> paige more like

[1:37:02] <@SoFarFetched> D:
[1:37:07] <MarylandJutsu> yeah paige ya gotta come out of the closet
[1:37:10] <%AncelDeLambert> just stay there
[1:37:10] <@SoFarFetched> no borrowed time
[1:37:11] <%AncelDeLambert> don't move
[1:37:15] <%AncelDeLambert> do NOT move
[1:37:17] <emper0rner0> Yeah this is how it always goes with high level bubbas
[1:37:19] <+mrshazboto> I don't understand the moral issue with camping in dbd.
[1:37:22] <inorwise> i hate bubba, he can just camp like that whenever he wants
[1:37:29] <$thomassolorio> sneeky sneeky
[1:37:32] <+IAmAkiva> HAAAAAY PAIIIIGE. Love the new setup.
[1:37:32] <MarylandJutsu> PHEW
[1:37:33] <%AncelDeLambert> nope
[1:37:33] <@SoFarFetched> he cant see you that close with BBQ and  chili
[1:37:37] <blind_bearyt> you dont see me becuse im a pro gamer
[1:37:40] <@SoFarFetched> but he's being a bad bubba
[1:37:40] <+Noahccountingfortaste> this is a rude Bubba
[1:37:47] <%AncelDeLambert> oh fuck this guy
[1:37:48] <emper0rner0> Wow what a piece of shit
[1:37:55] <%AncelDeLambert> what a douche
[1:37:56] <MarylandJutsu> WOW RUUUUUUDE
[1:37:59] <%TheWinged7> nothing could be done
[1:38:02] <$thomassolorio> guttsy
[1:38:03] <$Trenr> I mean, you could have let her die
[1:38:03] <%AncelDeLambert> @PeachSaliva girl you really gotta focus gens when they camp
[1:38:04] <inorwise> you need borrowed for that kind of play
[1:38:05] <$AzureGale> AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA
[1:38:06] <@SoFarFetched> Yeah nothings worse than killers who just do that.
[1:38:12] <@SoFarFetched> face camp and just smack
[1:38:17] <%ShockzNDrawe> see I don't get how any of this works but like
[1:38:21] <+mrshazboto> Why does the stronger killer not simply eat the smaller, weaker survivors
[1:38:28] <+Noahccountingfortaste> if the Meg is smart, she's waiting for hatch
[1:38:30] <MarylandJutsu> petition to tell this leatherface that he smells
[1:38:30] <emper0rner0> This bubba is tripled prestiged, he has no excuse for this behavior
[1:38:31] <%ShockzNDrawe> this just seems to ber playing kind of like an asshole
[1:38:45] <+Noahccountingfortaste> yes
[1:38:47] <inorwise> n o
[1:38:49] <+Noahccountingfortaste> when you die hatch spawns
[1:38:51] <inorwise> you need to die
[1:38:53] <inorwise> oop
[1:39:02] <@SoFarFetched> Hatch spawns when gens are done by how many survivors are still alive plus 1.
[1:39:07] <@SoFarFetched> or if you're the sole survivor hatch is there.
[1:39:11] <%AncelDeLambert> call him a noob in chat
[1:39:19] <MarylandJutsu> call him smelly
[1:39:22] <@SoFarFetched> a 9 rank? DansGame
[1:39:30] <+mrshazboto> So yeah i have no idea how this works and don't understand why camping is wrong
[1:39:33] <MarylandJutsu> sigh fiiiiinnnnne
[1:39:36] <%Ward_Walker> Cat's at the vet, hoping for good vibes tonight.
[1:39:36] <%AncelDeLambert> no but you should it'll be fun
[1:39:37] <%SpaghettiTime44> But what if he is smelly?
[1:39:38] <emper0rner0> People like that are why beginners stop playing
[1:39:46] <TurtlesAndTentacles> AND HE IS SMELLY FOR THAT
[1:39:49] <%AncelDeLambert> I've had MANY bad games, but I've never camped
[1:39:51] <%ShockzNDrawe> it's just bad sportsmanship
[1:39:52] <%skyentombment> @AncelDeLambert Call him a big doodoo man, and then appear on scrubquotes
[1:39:54] <%AncelDeLambert> I just swing at them on the post
[1:39:54] <%alternative_flu> its cheap?
[1:39:55] <$Agami23> doesent give much points
[1:39:56] <+NeonLight> Camping is specifically anti-fun
[1:39:57] <%SveriSageAdvice> camping doesnt give the killer as many points
[1:39:58] <$thomassolorio> its a bitch move
[1:39:59] <mustachegolem> god page looks like such a gamer in this setup.
[1:39:59] <@SoFarFetched> @mrshazboto camping gives you less points. The point of the killer is to get more hooks but just staying there while on first hook doesn't give you a lot of points. They do that JUST to secure kills.
[1:39:59] <%king_wragles> @PeachSaliva you nailed it actually
[1:40:01] <inorwise> @mrshazboto camping is really not fun for most of the people playing
[1:40:03] <%SaiyanShoto> It's bitch energy
[1:40:03] <+Noahccountingfortaste> it's just not fun to be camped
[1:40:04] <%BentArcher> intentionally removing the game form a player
[1:40:06] <augusta_wind> it makes the game less interesting and fun
[1:40:06] <%sumrand0> Breaking Intended Design
[1:40:06] <Discount_CJ> cause its easy?
[1:40:06] <%VexicBayn> yeah but play to win
[1:40:09] <+Shockrates20XX> It's generally poor sportsmanship and a losing strategy if the survivors just slam gens.
[1:40:11] <emper0rner0> Camping makes the game no fun at all for the person who is getting camped
[1:40:13] <$thomassolorio> its wack
[1:40:13] <madilynboyd> it makes things less fun for other players, for one thing
[1:40:14] <%ShockzNDrawe> like it seems like it's just a really borring stupid way to play
[1:40:17] <%aishman> No it takes points away
[1:40:17] <MarylandJutsu> the best part of the game is going for everyone
[1:40:18] <%AncelDeLambert> It's bad because it allows survivors free reign to finish generators and escape
[1:40:20] <COLEZILLA> you actually lose points when you camp
[1:40:22] <+Noahccountingfortaste> you DO tend to lose a lot of BP
[1:40:23] <@SoFarFetched> They only do that to secure the kills is why.
[1:40:23] <$Sphincter_Spelunker> Isn't the point to win? That seems like an unspoken rule
[1:40:24] <MarylandJutsu> @VexicBayn booooo
[1:40:24] <+lethallunacyx> It's just shitty, and you get less points doing that
[1:40:25] <%VexicBayn> not when I'm getting bullied by smurfs honestly
[1:40:25] <TurtlesAndTentacles> Winning is fun to some
[1:40:26] <$Agami23> theres really no point to it. less points, just sitting around and staring at someone
[1:40:26] <T_Sasquatch> No. I wanna win
[1:40:27] <%SveriSageAdvice> you need to be like an actual killer in horror films, where you're not going out of your way to *actually* kill all of the survivors
[1:40:32] <@SoFarFetched> Yeah if you're within a certain radius.
[1:40:33] <+mrshazboto> So dbd is more of an immersive thing and not a competitive thing. Dope
[1:40:36] <+MayorRev> fun??? eww
[1:40:37] <inorwise> also chases are the most fun part of the game, so camping is just like why do it?
[1:40:41] <MarylandJutsu> @T_Sasquatch shame you got bad taste
[1:40:44] <+lethallunacyx> That's not really winning anyway
[1:40:47] <@SoFarFetched> Dont oust yourself as a bad sportsmanship person in here LUL
[1:40:49] <%AncelDeLambert> camping is a great way to LOSE
[1:40:53] <%SveriSageAdvice> you'll win, but you'll lose out on a lot of EXP
[1:40:55] <+allups> yeah camping sucks f off with that
[1:40:58] <%VexicBayn> @lethallunacyx that's not what the scoreboard says
[1:41:00] <%sumrand0> Not Every game needs to be played like its going to EVO
[1:41:04] <+allups> least in this game
[1:41:04] <T_Sasquatch> @marylandjutsu still winning tho :)
[1:41:10] <phantomsleeves> you make the game sucky for that one person you camp, not fun
[1:41:17] <%SpaghettiTime44> This doesn't seem like the kind of game where people NEED to care about winning
[1:41:18] <MarylandJutsu> @T_Sasquatch still bad taste
[1:41:19] <%JoshManVGH> Do killers get awarded more points the more they act like a horror movie killer?
[1:41:23] <$AzureGale> Why not both
[1:41:33] <%sumrand0> ITS A CONSPIRACY
[1:41:34] <%SveriSageAdvice> @JoshManVGH ye
[1:41:34] <Dementedpenguin> I.... didn't see it as a big deal o_O
[1:41:36] <%ShockzNDrawe> people aren't usde to you being able to do that
[1:41:38] <+lethallunacyx> @VexicBayn You get more points by playing the game a certain way
[1:41:38] <TurtlesAndTentacles> No cause I think Disco is boring
[1:41:38] <LeiaSkynoober> Nooo, you're fine tbh
[1:41:38] <+gr8typhoon> Why not BOTH
[1:41:40] <$Sphincter_Spelunker> Pat smells
[1:41:42] <%YakumoYomi> Nah, people are just making a funny
[1:41:42] <%ShockzNDrawe> cuz youa lways use dthe same set up
[1:41:43] <%SaiyanShoto> Nah you're good
[1:41:43] <+allups> well we really cant watch both actually
[1:41:44] <+Noahccountingfortaste> no, you're fine
[1:41:45] <$thomassolorio> no regerts
[1:41:47] <%TheWinged7> nah, the overlap was only ~90mins
[1:41:51] <T_Sasquatch> All I do is win , win , win. No matter what
[1:41:52] <+Noahccountingfortaste> stream when you want to
[1:41:54] <TurtlesAndTentacles> You gave me a HEALTHY alternative
[1:41:54] <maskedmook> no you're cool

[2:01:43] <KaiserMario> ooo... time for some dungeon grampas
[2:01:43] <%sumrand0> DBD is missing an opportunity to do a "Spring Forward" and "Fall back" event
[2:01:58] <@SoFarFetched> Chinese New Year
[2:02:01] <%sumrand0> Dead by Daylight Savings time
[2:02:06] <@SoFarFetched> Anniversary is coming up.
[2:02:15] <+Kinoskae> @peachsaliva You better hope Elmo never teaches Gief to angry poop in the tub
[2:02:16] <@SoFarFetched> which should be May geefThink
[2:02:22] <Rozalyndis> because quebec doesn't believe in that shit?
[2:02:23] <%Nox_Ludicro> The anxiety when your child or pet hasn't pooped all day is true fear.
[2:02:25] <Rozalyndis> just a guess
[2:02:27] <%maskofmichael> gief poo on stream?
[2:02:35] <%sumrand0> hahaha
[2:02:35] <@MelBrooksKA> Because DST is dumb\
[2:02:38] <+allups> also before i leave DBD should add the scooby gang to the game
[2:02:40] <@SoFarFetched> wow they left you
[2:02:41] <@SoFarFetched> D:
[2:02:42] <%VexicBayn> @heartlesshealer but it makes a much better cleaning solution
[2:02:42] <emper0rner0> When is the anniversary? I want XP cakes lol
[2:02:45] <$AzureGale> Eeeeeeep
[2:02:51] <%sumrand0> but DST is also evil so its on theme

[2:03:03] <inorwise> they dont like your breath girl
[2:03:12] <@SoFarFetched> yeah they probably will.
[2:03:15] <@SoFarFetched> I feel you Felix.
[2:03:17] <@MelBrooksKA> DST isn't evil, it's just dumb
[2:03:21] <@SoFarFetched> with that name
[2:03:35] <%TheWinged7> we have now learnt, WcDoogals is a Geif repellant
[2:03:36] <%Nox_Ludicro> Should be 105% BP bonus this year, assuming their pattern continues.
[2:03:43] <%VexicBayn> @melbrookska even dumber when you consider that Arizona and Hawaii just chose to ignore it
[2:03:48] <%sumrand0> @melbrookska the two aren't mutually exclusive
[2:03:49] <%alternative_flu> cover your camera in bags of ice bro
[2:03:54] <@SoFarFetched> Jekado will DM you stuff about it after the stream,he's been checking more things for you Paige.

[2:04:41] <@MelBrooksKA> @VexicBayn That's why I like living in AZ
[2:04:43] <MarylandJutsu> emlooooo
[2:04:45] <heartlesshealer> psaGib
[2:04:47] <SaphronBlackbourne> Oh now Eli is streaming too
[2:04:47] <@Jekado> It seems to "maybe" an over heating issue
[2:04:51] <%king_wragles> Wait, if we can't see Paige then how are we hearing her?
[2:04:52] <@SoFarFetched> he screm
[2:04:54] <%sumrand0> Aren't product supposed to work when they're new?
[2:04:59] <SaphronBlackbourne> I hope Paige deos Danganronpa eventually
[2:05:03] <@SoFarFetched> psaPorgmo psaPorgmo psaPorgmo psaPorgmo psaPorgmo psaPorgmo psaPorgmo psaPorgmo
[2:05:05] <@Jekado> the sony cameras have a system of Auto Temp that make them turn off at a certain heat level.
[2:05:06] <@SoFarFetched> he screm more
[2:05:07] <$AzureGale> Paige is a ghost now
[2:05:25] <$thomassolorio> darkness empresoning me all that i see
[2:05:26] <@Jekado> the battery wouldn't generate as much heat as say using a wire since the wire would be "live" always
[2:05:33] <%sumrand0> y no product recall? is this acceptable?
[2:05:45] <@SoFarFetched> apparently sony cameras have this issue in general.
[2:05:56] <$Sphincter_Spelunker> xbox wins again
[2:06:00] <@SoFarFetched> There's also no A/C or fan in her room so it might be overheating a lot more easier.
[2:06:02] <%the_super_suit> money is on nurse
[2:06:13] <@SoFarFetched> ESpecially in a corner set up
[2:06:18] <@MelBrooksKA> Put a fan on it?
[2:06:18] <%king_wragles> Nope
[2:06:25] <@SoFarFetched> Deathslinger I think?
[2:06:29] <%king_wragles> Deathslinger
[2:06:34] <@Jekado> @sumrand0 recalls are for if the issue is a huge amount of the products this seems like a rare issue for the cameras.  she might be able to RMA it.
[2:06:36] <@SoFarFetched> cause I heard the crack
[2:06:38] <@SoFarFetched> of his gun
[2:06:40] <%king_wragles> He got new music
[2:06:43] <%SveriSageAdvice> problem is Paige mentioned it doesnt feel hot when it does this, so could it really be overheating?
[2:06:43] <%Nox_Ludicro> Sounds like Mr. Gun
[2:06:52] <@SoFarFetched> Depending how close you are to his radius,the music changes for the killer
[2:06:57] <%king_wragles> No no, his MAP has a bunch of pianos just making noise
[2:07:11] <@Jekado> There are options to mitigate the turning of but i don't know how well the fixes are
[2:07:22] <@SoFarFetched> and yeah the his map with the Saloon does all the piano noises LUL
[2:07:23] <%sumrand0> I just got an RMA on a Vape actually so Paige have you considered getting an RMA from Sony?
[2:07:46] <inorwise> hill billy maybe he got a new chase song
[2:07:57] <%sumrand0> My process was really simple and straightforward with 3 weeks turnaround time
[2:07:58] <@SoFarFetched> wit did that meg try to kobe? DansGame on first hook
[2:08:19] <inorwise> look out for chainsaw
[2:08:26] <+mrshazboto> Reloaded the stream and got a godzilla vs kong ad lying to me telling me the movie was up. Can confirm movie is NOT up on HBO Max and am sad now
[2:08:27] <%the_super_suit> damn that was fsat
[2:08:31] <@Jekado> @SveriSageAdvice Yes the issue is the camera has a low temp setting to turn of at a certain temperature. she can set it to a higher threshold.   I think the Standard temp mode is if you are using it more as a handheld camera.
[2:08:35] <inorwise> billy
[2:08:37] <@SoFarFetched> OH Billy
[2:08:38] <@SoFarFetched> D:
[2:08:47] <%the_super_suit> billyyyyyyyyyy
[2:09:06] <@SoFarFetched> wonder if that was him barely doing his chainsaw then earlier geefThink
[2:09:10] <Zeif00> I forget his chase music changed after his rework
[2:09:11] <%Nox_Ludicro> Oh yeah, billy got new music recently
[2:09:17] <@Jekado> M1 billy?
[2:09:17] <inorwise> the new song came with his big update, the update was a nerf basically
[2:09:26] <%sumrand0> @jekado that's why I'd suggest getting an RMA from sony now since she'll be gone for a month that should be enough time to send it in and get a new one sent back
[2:09:30] <%the_super_suit> does the new killer have kpop chase music?
[2:09:46] <SaphronBlackbourne> Nerfed Billy
[2:09:47] <@SoFarFetched> yeah they trying to give all the killers special chase music
[2:09:52] <+thegostofjon> i dont know if they ALL do but a lot do
[2:10:00] <inorwise> the nerf was for billy, his chainsaw has a overheat now
[2:10:09] <@SoFarFetched> @the_super_suit Tricksters music is on the creepy end with how it sounds when you get closer.
[2:10:09] <+mrshazboto> @sumrand0 woah woah - gone for a month?
[2:10:23] <@Jekado> @sumrand0 yeah no RMA might be the best option at this point.  thats the issue with electronics in general sometimes you are unlucky and get a bad device.
[2:10:24] <rcand9> why are you streaming from the void paige? plagueGripes
[2:10:29] <@SoFarFetched> @mrshazboto she has some business to do in the states and may be gone for a long while.
[2:10:32] <%the_super_suit> i've never actually played this game lol i just really enjoy the lore
