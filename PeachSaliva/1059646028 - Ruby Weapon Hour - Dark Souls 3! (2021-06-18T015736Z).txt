When I first started watching your Bloodborne streams, I had just dropped out of college due to health issues that effectively left me disabled and housebound for a few years. Your shenanigans gave me some joy while I waited to find an effective treatment and go back to school, then you kept me going for 2 years while I finished my degree. So thank you for keeping me sane and helping me graduate last month, you honestly made a difference

[0:59:46] <Ner234> Gief is a chad
[0:59:47] <Prevot> it's because you named him Zangief
[0:59:47] <+Chimeraelite> He grew into his STRONG status

[1:01:44] <%Pandybun> Zangief is angry at Sony too
[1:01:46] <@SoFarFetched> I still love that onion article where it's sony going "OKAY WE'RE DONE MAKING PS5s"
[1:01:46] <%FacetiousAF> gief hear's "dub" and goes all psaDogchamp
[1:01:52] <DrkJP520> I thought PS5 was a myth.
[1:01:52] <$Sphincter_Spelunker> What games are there even to play on a PS5
[1:01:54] <+Freelance7> It's not really Sony's fault
[1:01:58] <generalve> ITS BEEN 9 MONTHS
[1:01:59] <%KeiganOfAstora> Man fuck this
[1:02:02] <%sick_kickflips> I got lucky and nabbed one at target first try
[1:02:08] <marvel877> I'm still waiting for a disc PS5 from Walmart to go on sale.
[1:02:11] <+LonePlus_> i got a digital today

[1:02:14] <Aydarkzero> got mine from the sony site
[1:02:14] <@SoFarFetched> I mean a shit ton of stuff use semiconductors is the problem
[1:02:18] <Wiiplayah43> @Sphincter_Spelunker plenty, but not many exclusives yet
[1:02:19] <$Sphincter_Spelunker> @generalve it'll be years before the stock evens out with demand
[1:02:22] <+LonePlus_> because i havent bought physical games in like 8 years
[1:02:24] <@SoFarFetched> so we got that semiconductor shortage for a long while
[1:02:27] <udurbalanced> Is that DeadwingDork?
[1:02:29] <VritraReiRei> Also Metroid Dread Special Edition sold out in 5 seconds along with the amiibos... :(
[1:02:29] <Soulsbjorne> Yeah ive had one since launch. suck it nerds
[1:02:32] <theremedialclass> whats up gaymers, we at the end?
[1:02:32] <+jerkhov> Demon's Souls is getting a PS4 port apparently, so PS5 literally has no games
[1:02:36] <%walternatorz> I was watching it before this
[1:02:41] <%Ranryu692> I got a new mattress recently and one of the delivery guys offered me $700 for my PS5 LUL
[1:02:42] <peachy996> Mike cries laughing
[1:02:42] <Monkeyweed21> Pat is ambivalent about CBT
[1:02:47] <+Freelance7> @jerkhov It's got Ratchet and Clank
[1:02:48] <%ComfortableStranger> yes, but Pat, how many dicks did you suck to get those ps5s?
[1:02:57] <+wizard_of_diamonds> I will never not be salty about how brands handled the shortage. They'd make the same amount of money selling legit, they just don't care
[1:02:59] <%ElkRiverDog> Sorry about the spider shower story on Tuesday. As penance, I offer you the tidbit that spiders, wasp, hornets, and the like HATE the smell of peppermint oil. Hope this helps and have a great stream.
[1:03:01] <+patriotrenegade> I miss Bowsette

[1:03:08] <Aydarkzero> yeah that was dumb
[1:03:10] <+jerkhov> a 3D platformer in 2021 isn't really a system seller
[1:03:10] <TurtlesAndTentacles> My heroes eat pussy
[1:03:15] <+SaiyanShoto> Batman is DJ Khalid now

[1:03:25] <ncr7wms3r22b7n3> Batman forgot his bat-dental dam
[1:03:28] <Ner234> Are you really a hero if you don't eat ass?
[1:03:28] <DracaenaLeaf> Harley Quinn isn't a kids show tho is it?

[1:03:36] <@SoFarFetched> @thefakeh geefNLT 12 months
[1:03:36] <peachy996> It's totally from the people at the top saying that
[1:03:38] <abakkus> heroes are CELIBATE and do not know what """"sex"""" is
[1:03:40] <+FackinCrazy> Batman only eats ass

[1:03:50] <+barristerofthebar> Does Superman Munch the Coochie?
[1:03:51] <%Ranryu692> They were talking about it being done on-screen, not about him doing it at all
[1:03:55] <marvel877> Batman has to practice because what if he had to eat his way out of a situation? What then?!
[1:03:59] <+whiskywolfe> Zack Snyder literally just posted a picture of Batman going down on Catwoman on his Twitter.
[1:03:59] <+jerkhov> joker eats ass, chaotic
[1:04:05] <Wiiplayah43> @jerkhov The idea that no exclusives = no games is one of the most obnoxious & false ideas in the gaming community.
[1:04:12] <+SaiyanShoto> @feralspidey A playboy that doesn't give

[1:21:41] <Wiiplayah43> @GalacticaPhanto Well, not everyone gets all news all the time. I haven't followed Jim Sterling for years, my following of CSB is spotty, and I don't follow gaming news outside of Youtube.

[1:25:18] <$JoshManVGH> "They come here, they all come here... how... do they find me!" has been an office mantra for years.

[1:25:30] <otakon17> I mean, you HAVE the hyper armor but not the health and defense
[1:25:32] <crimeagentalpha> You know Paige is frustrated when she does the Nancy Reagan voice.
[1:25:34] <+patriotrenegade> you can skip this
[1:25:36] <Dfreddy8> He's just like SANIC
[1:25:37] <DraxTD> Whas that smell?!
[1:25:37] <+Freakin_Wolfy> So wait, do they just watch the Abyss and that's it? Shouldn't they be called the Abyss Do Something About It'ers?

[1:25:39] <Dunmarkh> @MrTaylorPony she's been playing for maybe 10 minutes

[1:25:41] <Monkeyweed21> @HotSauceFiend the shield empowers her and she never uses it
[1:25:42] <Dova573> Paige would be a May player
[1:25:42] <@SoFarFetched> she forgets to use it
[1:25:42] <Doomstar16> This cutscene is always so fun to watch and the music is perfect with it.
[1:25:44] <@SoFarFetched> geefLul
[1:25:44] <%sharpened_hammer> She rolls when using shields.
[1:25:46] <BigFingerRo> Place your bets guys, are we gonna get through this time or nah?
[1:25:46] <leinadtonu> Master the Bunga
[1:25:47] <rekinom> Adolf ELIZABETH Hitler?

[1:36:48] <Aydarkzero> and i mean a LOT of souls
[1:36:51] <Lancaster_H> i mean I'd be cool with being within her bosom

[1:36:56] <+patriotrenegade> Which is bullshit imo

[1:37:38] <+Lunarhawk> all endings suck cause then its over
[1:37:39] <%Ranryu692> did Pat just tell Paige to fuck a bone?
[1:37:41] <DianaTheAscian> @Faustgesicht more like 3.5
[1:37:41] <%heartlesshealer> I wish the options would gray out in games when you don't have the items
[1:37:42] <+tigerfang86> NONE of the endings are really great
[1:37:43] <%ComfortableStranger> having humanity is bad???

[1:37:59] <Djinnazz> They‚Äôre not that bad,
[1:38:00] <+Undenizen> the moral of Dark Souls is ENTROPY ALWAYS WINS.
[1:38:00] <DianaTheAscian> ITS TIME
[1:38:02] <wantedsafe471> It's time face the SKELETON WARRIORS!
[1:38:02] <TonberryLives> End of Fire is my favorite
[1:38:03] <+DrTribal> the best ending is letting the fire fade with the fire keeper. It allows the world to be reborn
[1:38:12] <%superc37> dark souls is about eath and moving the fuck on already

[2:16:38] <Zakaraz> why even have pineapple juice in the house if 1/2 the occupants would die? its good but not good enough to potentially poison someone as helpless as paige
[2:16:40] <razethetek> that way
