[0:02:37] <@PlagueOfGripes> game audio can go down a couple pips
[0:02:37] <%ThirdWelles> Game music is just a tad louder than you guys. Like maybe 10-15%
[0:02:38] <dan_g_v> so professional
[0:02:42] <%Agami23> i hope you guys playing this will make me understand why people like it
[0:02:46] <@PlagueOfGripes> music overtakes you sometimes

[0:03:11] <@MelBrooksKA> Man, I sure would like to try that, but my computer is now in the shop because my upgrade went poop
[0:03:11] <+whyskeywolfe> Yeah the audio could stand to go down a little bit.

[0:03:35] <+zamatermort> dont turn him up, turn game down
[0:03:35] <@PlagueOfGripes> his audio is fine, it's mostly the game audio
[0:03:40] <@MelBrooksKA> You can probably turn game down a notch
[0:03:42] <%ThirdWelles> Paige I think you turned up the game audio too
[0:03:46] <%ThirdWelles> Like along with Pat
[0:03:49] <Huntercd> Why does Elmo sound like Paige?

[0:13:58] <Huntercd> Is the mustard energy around Paige intentional?
[0:13:59] <KaiserMario> Is the reason why Paige seldom wears glasses is because she's scared she might break and devour the glass again?
[0:14:00] <+chuckyswiss> Rip and tear Paige!!
[0:14:01] <+polypolipauli> Sprint + melee = HULK SMASH
[0:14:06] <NireFuster> Oh yeah it totally reminds me of warframe

Here's some bits to contribute to Paige's inevitable increasingly weird cravings when Pat's orb starts kicking. Also also it seems like love is in the air cuz I met my girlfriend's family for the first time the other day! Y'all are an absolute power couple and the ultimate OTP!!
[0:28:14] <%MisterRockett> This is so fucking shlocky.

[0:29:32] <$Sphincter_Spelunker> @LifesNeverHumDrum Oddly specific. And yet I completely get it
[0:29:32] <%TakingLifesL> so are they both going to upload to youtube? I got here late and missed the start.
[0:29:35] <@SoFarFetched> I still feel like they were trying to make another Gears game
[0:29:50] <LifesNeverHumDrum> oh fuck yeah ground pound
[0:29:53] <@SoFarFetched> @TakingLifesL yes both will be uploaded
[0:29:56] <+storebrandcandy> gears of bioshock?
[0:30:00] <%TakingLifesL> cool
[0:30:05] <@SoFarFetched> since it's seperate streams and not everyone watches both streams.
[0:30:27] <Pookiedaexzile> More like Gears of Destiny : A Modern Divsion

[0:34:25] <silverira> thx @SoFarFetched
[0:34:26] <LifesNeverHumDrum> gun magician and rock wizard
[0:34:34] <%ygtidal> gun mage
[0:34:43] <xbb1024> so this is like a pve multiplayer
[0:34:51] <@Jekado> green means more damage
[0:35:24] <mr_saturday93> that's awesome
[0:35:43] <NireFuster> he LOVES it
[0:35:59] <+alternative_flu> noice
[0:36:09] <%OswaldTheDog> the music is giving big halo vibes
[0:36:16] <LifesNeverHumDrum> paige said "fuck cover who needs it"
[0:36:29] <@SoFarFetched> Cover doesn't actually do anything in this game.
[0:36:37] <@SoFarFetched> since the developers said cover isn't really a thing.
[0:36:51] <PinoProxie> paige must kill
[0:36:51] <@SoFarFetched> you're supposed to be more out shooting.
[0:36:52] <+alternative_flu> cover kinda helps but you're meant to move around during combat
[0:37:02] <LifesNeverHumDrum> oh snap ok. it's still funny to see someone stand in the middle of the battlefield but ok good to know
[0:37:13] <@SoFarFetched> yeah I think it only "slightly" lets you take less damage.
[0:37:22] <+coward_man> @SoFarFetched I find cover useful for Trickster cause quite low HP and armour
[0:37:24] <LifesNeverHumDrum> mmmm ok. stay dancing
[0:37:27] <@Jekado> yeah they throw grenades and they can kinda shoot through cover
[0:37:37] <+alternative_flu> boss fights in this game are tuff
[0:38:12] <@Jekado> very bullet spongey
[0:38:28] <@Jekado> and they get super armor if you do to much damage to them
[0:38:28] <Arth__> looks really code vein
[0:38:43] <+MisterTylerrr> DOES HE LOOK LIKE A BITCH?
[0:39:17] <darklurker_dumahiem> he looks like a beach
[0:39:55] <darklurker_dumahiem> laid out sandy and full of crabs
[0:40:39] <xbb1024> is it possible to solo?

[0:42:28] <$Sphincter_Spelunker> Paige is allergic to cover

[1:00:59] <Meltgar> @Yosepmeist There's a feeling of it being an old game
[1:01:13] <darklurker_dumahiem> So.....Farfetch tell me one(joke) that doesnt get me banned....i gave you a gewd one
[1:01:20] <Meltgar> Stadia version will come until Pat decides to buy a stadia Kappa

[1:02:58] <@SoFarFetched> @darklurker_dumahiem for the record,you were not banned.  You were timed out for a week on Pat's channel because you refused to listen to your first time out when I told you not to spam a message.
[1:03:14] <N8strength> Mass  Effect as fuck
[1:03:15] <@Jekado> the shotgun fall of is really high
[1:03:20] <@SoFarFetched> Please do not make that same mistake here.
[1:03:41] <%king_wragles> Auto shottys don't seem to have that problem, but they're overall damage ain't awesome
[1:03:44] <%king_wragles> They SOUND great tho
[1:04:04] <darklurker_dumahiem> i've been watching for years.....ive seen spam.....a week? how much did the racist guy get?
[1:04:28] <@SoFarFetched> A complete Ban.

[1:06:23] <darklurker_dumahiem> also....hard ball...for all the objectionable stuff on the net....an unfunny running gag.....
[1:06:30] <@StridentSong> @darklurker_dumahiem Just let it go. It's a week timeout. The racist dude got flat out banned permanently. Don't drag drama from Pat's stream in here

[1:07:21] <Meltgar> Damn, gibbed
[1:07:39] <xbb1024> I think I like Peach's build more
[1:07:53] <Profmcstevie> Peachs Build runs forward and clicks, it fits
[1:07:53] <@Jekado> pats build is way more ability dependant
[1:08:08] <@Jekado> yeah peach is suppose to be ungabunga so it works for her
[1:08:11] <+Yosepmeist> This game has good gibs, feels great
[1:08:17] <NireFuster> BLUE
[1:08:17] <ChungusQuest> It's one of them time-based throwing mines!
[1:08:18] <%Promessa_EX> mines aren't necessarily trip mines
[1:08:44] <Meltgar> Lol, pat's armor looks more for an engi/tank, and Peach's stuff look more for a scout/range

[1:08:52] <%Promessa_EX> that rifle with 132 power is basically a bolter

[1:46:13] <+Rolandknight> Good game?
[1:46:35] <+coward_man> I had no interest in this game until like a week ago and it's pretty fun
[1:46:36] <@PlagueOfGripes> I'm not getting paid to say it is, but so far, yeah
[1:46:36] <bettysharkface> This lady looks like she's a young person wearing old people makeup
[1:46:59] <%tizz86> Cool, may have to check it out.
[1:47:26] <+coward_man> there's a handy free demo you can play

[1:47:37] <TheZearGuy> Something Anthem about this
[1:47:39] <+theMrRoboto> Either that helmet isnt hers or she took it off and put her shawl back on for the cool points

[1:48:02] <InugamiTheHound> I get a mix the division, borderlands and destiny from this game

[1:48:20] <%tizz86> I just have so little free time to actually pay anything recently
[1:48:26] <TheZearGuy> @coward_man Yeah, that sounds about right. Weird
[1:49:40] <+coward_man> it's honestly more fun than I expected even solo and the classes do actually play differently. I'm playing a class that can teleport behind enemies and cause timestop
[1:49:52] <bettysharkface> I like watching their materials flip wildly when they cut the camera between them
[1:50:06] <%tizz86> @coward_man that's pretty interesting
[1:50:20] <+loukemia83> Why is the camera so shaky during cutscenes, it is disconcerting
[1:50:20] <@SoFarFetched> WITH YOUR BEASTIE BOYS AND BON JON JOVIES
[1:50:26] <InugamiTheHound> beastie boys? is cannon in this game storyline?

[1:52:51] <LifesNeverHumDrum> yeah show that door
[1:52:58] <@Jekado> there are a lot of graphical things that are annoying but fixable,  i don't like the UI on PC and boy that cover mechanic is annoying.
[1:53:14] <@Jekado> guns feel good to shoot and those powers are pretty dope
[1:53:24] <+Houndemise> why this game doesn't have cross saves?

[1:54:56] <@SoFarFetched> Paige got that sweet sponsor from Square Enix
[1:55:07] <@Jekado> the devastator leap will lock you into place sometimes.  it happened to strident when he used it.
[1:55:10] <+doomunderthestairs> yeaaaaahhhhh
[1:55:14] <@MelBrooksKA> Whitest, non-toasted bread I've ever seen
[1:55:23] <%king_wragles> This is the hardest choice for Devastator
[1:55:30] <@Jekado> thats a dope ability
[1:55:32] <%king_wragles> What to get rid of for reflect
[1:55:38] <$Sphincter_Spelunker> sounds like Pat
[1:55:59] <%king_wragles> Cause jump is awesome, Golem is like your signature move. Quake just does work etc etc
[1:56:11] <+theMrRoboto> Paige stop holding E and just tap to pick up
[1:56:21] <@Jekado> i feel like reflect is a good for tank build
[1:56:29] <@Jekado> so keep the ironskin and jump?
[1:56:33] <@PlagueOfGripes> I'm level 6 and big
[1:56:37] <SiameseSneeze> It's probably been said a hundred times, but congrats on the engagement PeachSaliva and Pat
[1:56:56] <@Jekado> Plague what did you pick for class?
[1:57:07] <%king_wragles> I mean I want to be okay with not having quake, but I'm real slow on the jump. I start it on time but I keep taking time with the targeting
[1:57:08] <InugamiTheHound> @SiameseSneeze is that true? They are getting married?
[1:57:17] <%king_wragles> Uh, I think Plague said Devastator earlier in chat?
[1:57:22] <@SoFarFetched> Yeah they announced their engagement on the podcast earlier this week.
[1:57:25] <$Sphincter_Spelunker> @InugamiTheHound you're about a weeks late. yea
[1:57:30] <$Sphincter_Spelunker> a week*
[1:57:31] <SiameseSneeze> yeh Inugami
[1:57:41] <@PlagueOfGripes> I went with Trickster
[1:57:55] <@Jekado> ah thats the up close "ninja" class right?
[1:58:02] <%king_wragles> I wasn't even close lol
[1:58:08] <InugamiTheHound> @Sphincter_Spelunker I haven't been any fo their streams or listened to the podcast in over a year
[1:58:36] <$Sphincter_Spelunker> @InugamiTheHound then you have good timing. They also got a bull dog last July
[1:58:45] <Pookiedaexzile> Maybe use the shot gun
[1:58:51] <@PlagueOfGripes> it's actually not really a ninja class at all. It's more of an off-tank class
[1:58:52] <InugamiTheHound> @Sphincter_Spelunker I knew about the bull dog via twitter
[1:58:54] <Pookiedaexzile> then again, she did just save pat
[1:59:01] <$Sphincter_Spelunker> he fat, and big
[1:59:05] <@PlagueOfGripes> coincidentally the sort of style I prefer in games but you rarely see
[1:59:07] <darklurker_dumahiem> Cid Cesar once said to me" So your friends worked on the cheap?" So I RepIied Was Standing next to Gene Wilder "You've only got two inches to work with ....So Can you work to Scale?"
[1:59:14] <@SoFarFetched> @InugamiTheHound they also announced the engagement on twitter too.
[1:59:14] <%king_wragles> I feel like Trickster is really versatile, since it can be: tanky, high mobility, or burst damage
[1:59:32] <InugamiTheHound> @SoFarFetched I must have missed that one
[2:00:02] <@SoFarFetched> yeah I think its currently their pinned tweets.
[2:00:10] <@Jekado> i mean don't all the classes have decent versatility?
[2:00:10] <darklurker_dumahiem> Madeline Kahn said"i can fit in ther"
[2:00:52] <darklurker_dumahiem> she said it exactly like that with no "E" on the end
[2:00:53] <@Moobot> Outriders is neato burrito! Click here to try it! https://i.try.games/outriders/5pl14h
[2:01:01] <darklurker_dumahiem> excuse me th Nd
[2:01:39] <LifesNeverHumDrum> this is how paige hifives irl yeah?
[2:01:41] <darklurker_dumahiem> what would a nito burrito taste like? bones and cheese?...marrow....and curds?
[2:01:56] <%king_wragles> More or less @Jekado , but I feel like Tricster's choices are a bit wider. Then again I haven't played pyro/trickster yet. Liking Devastator and Techno a ton
[2:02:14] <@Jekado> are you planning on playing it when it comes out king?
[2:02:19] <%king_wragles> Ye
[2:02:23] <InugamiTheHound> LOL
[2:02:25] <+doomunderthestairs> like Knack
[2:02:25] <LifesNeverHumDrum> nailed it
[2:02:26] <Meltgar> JUST LIKE KNACK LUL
[2:02:33] <%king_wragles> It's probably still not going to appeal to everyone, but I've pre-ordered it
[2:02:34] <@Jekado> i'm probably gonna pass on this until later
[2:02:42] <@SoFarFetched> wragles is gonna be poor
[2:02:55] <%king_wragles> If SE is watching, that was totally because of PatStares at and PeachSaliva's streams
[2:02:55] <@Jekado> i'm gonna stick with DRG as my shooty game for now even though its different.
[2:03:01] <%king_wragles> Give them more money
[2:03:09] <TurtlesAndTentacles> Careful guardian
[2:03:11] <SiameseSneeze> I fucking love DRG
[2:03:28] <%thotbane> DRG is fucking ra
[2:03:30] <$Sphincter_Spelunker> Stasis + Sniper was the tits in Mass Effect
[2:03:30] <@Jekado> new guns might be in a future update
[2:03:49] <@Jekado> but yeah Outriders has a market at least
[2:03:52] <InugamiTheHound> what is DRG?
[2:03:57] <@Jekado> deep rock galactic
[2:03:59] <%thotbane> deep rock galactic
[2:04:10] <darklurker_dumahiem> DQP
[2:04:14] <@SoFarFetched> is good game,can be repetitive to some.
[2:04:22] <%juxtest> Dragoon
[2:04:22] <%thotbane> the gameplay loop is so tight
[2:04:23] <@SoFarFetched> Since it's dwarves
[2:04:24] <Meltgar> Dwarfs Round' Garfing
[2:04:25] <%FacetiousAF> we talkin abotu the DRG free weekend?
[2:04:32] <Meltgar> DRG is recommended
[2:04:37] <%FacetiousAF> I AM A DWARF AND I'M DIGGING A HOLE
[2:04:43] <Meltgar> @FacetiousAF Is it?
[2:04:45] <@SoFarFetched> Paige was a flamin' hot cheeto geefBlank
[2:04:55] <$Sphincter_Spelunker> that's called a DOT, Paige
[2:05:07] <invalid_robin> DRG is rad
[2:05:17] <%FacetiousAF> @Meltgar over on steam ye
[2:05:29] <$Sphincter_Spelunker> so is the Trickers the air bender
[2:05:36] <InugamiTheHound> her class reminds me of vanguard class from mass effect 2 and 3
[2:05:38] <$Sphincter_Spelunker> Trickster*
[2:06:10] <darklurker_dumahiem> jalapeno cheeseburger
[2:06:30] <InugamiTheHound> reflect the bullets
[2:06:34] <Pookiedaexzile> Shot gun is good for close
[2:06:47] <LifesNeverHumDrum> i was going to compliment Paige doing a good job earlier, but she rolled into fire as I was typing so
[2:07:06] <@Jekado> should of typed faster...
[2:07:25] <@MelBrooksKA> psaCrazyhand  psaCrazyhead
[2:07:28] <floralkami> ayyye
[2:07:29] <LifesNeverHumDrum> ....can Crazy Talk spread through ginger cuz uhhh
[2:07:34] <Pookiedaexzile> SNiper is bad for face fucking
[2:07:38] <darklurker_dumahiem> Woolie on "Hot ones"
[2:08:02] <$Sphincter_Spelunker> Hot Pepper Gaming walked so Hot Ones could run
[2:08:02] <@Moobot> Outriders is neato burrito! Click here to try it! https://i.try.games/outriders/5pl14h
[2:08:10] <Pookiedaexzile> Gun is Baba
[2:08:14] <%tizz86> @darklurker_dumahiem have you tried their sauces?
[2:08:24] <LifesNeverHumDrum> Gun doesn't like that, Gun ceases to be
[2:08:38] <darklurker_dumahiem> no i do not do spicy
[2:08:47] <cherrycottontail> crazy talk duplicates on marriage
[2:08:58] <@SoFarFetched> I sometimes miss hot pepper  gaming,but realizing it was just a pure side thing of theirs. It makes sense why it had to end.
[2:09:03] <InugamiTheHound> use a bolt action rifle that close may not be the best thing to do
[2:09:07] <darklurker_dumahiem> my stomach is permanently agitated....from alcoholism
[2:09:26] <%thotbane> @cherrycottontail I mean its like in the RPG Exalted, where the god of lies, The Ebon Dragon, LOVES the concept of marriage and think its hilarious
[2:09:40] <%thotbane> Exalted is very bad btw
[2:09:44] <Pookiedaexzile> Hey Paige, the Sniper rifle is bad for you
[2:09:49] <%tizz86> that's too bad.  both versions of the Original are good.  Both Los Calientes are good.  I have a bottle of Last Dab XXX and even tho it's ridiculously hot, it's delicious
[2:09:59] <Pookiedaexzile> She now has two of them
[2:10:33] <%king_wragles> There are also only so many reviews you can watch where the whole thing is they ate a pepper
[2:10:34] <@Jekado> @tizz86 whats the flavor is it like a vinegary spice or something else?
[2:10:34] <@SoFarFetched> "two of them"
[2:10:48] <%thotbane> Shai'hulud
[2:10:49] <LifesNeverHumDrum> oooooh land whale
[2:10:51] <%tizz86> @jekado of which one?
[2:10:54] <@SoFarFetched> @king_wragles you should watch the robot unicorn one if you haven't
[2:11:14] <%thotbane> thats an aaaaaaaaaalien
[2:11:17] <darklurker_dumahiem> its pats mom from the future
[2:11:34] <@Jekado> @tizz86 both? i just use hot drops to make things spicy.
[2:11:49] <LifesNeverHumDrum> this scene looks like a Death Stranding
[2:11:56] <$Sphincter_Spelunker> what a bitch
[2:11:57] <@SoFarFetched> LUL
[2:11:58] <rosencruez> ...really?
[2:12:01] <@SoFarFetched> just like that
[2:12:05] <Meltgar> EDGE
[2:12:05] <%thotbane> LUL
[2:12:07] <LifesNeverHumDrum> oh he teleported into bullet
[2:12:09] <rosencruez> KARMA
[2:12:09] <@Jekado> Shy did a clip of this scene
[2:12:10] <$Sphincter_Spelunker> good
[2:12:11] <NireFuster> INSTANT KARMA COMPILATION LUL
[2:12:12] <%thotbane> DOES THIS HAPPEN EVERY CUTSCENE
[2:12:13] <+traximus_s> Everybody's gonna die
[2:12:15] <Meltgar> GET FKED LUL
[2:12:15] <Pookiedaexzile> I love this game
[2:12:19] <TurtlesAndTentacles> I laughed so loud LUL
[2:12:27] <Pesuto> Okay, that was actually funny
[2:12:29] <EuropanLamprey> "Why did we even come out here?"
[2:12:42] <Pookiedaexzile> War is war and I'm a bad ass and now I'm a dead
[2:13:08] <%thotbane> what's the general conceit of the game
[2:13:26] <%thotbane> like the "plot" regardless of whether the plot matters
[2:13:34] <%tizz86> the "original" is your typical hot sauce, little vinegar. they have a garlic version.  Both versions of Los Calientes taste like the "southwest" in a bottle.  The last dab XXX  is slightly sweet, hearty and smoky, then intense heat kicks you in the face
[2:13:45] <LifesNeverHumDrum> colorblind moments
[2:13:58] <Pookiedaexzile> Tank with two sniper rifles build video when
[2:13:59] <$Sphincter_Spelunker> glasses do not help the blind
[2:14:02] <goblinpuppy> is the fiancé thing real? Congratulations!!!!!!!!!!!
[2:14:42] <%FacetiousAF> thank you for sponsor
[2:14:43] <@Jekado> hmm i like sweet i might actually try last dab.  i eat too much spicy and its a problem

[2:15:19] <@Moobot> Outriders is neato burrito! Click here to try it! https://i.try.games/outriders/5pl14h
[2:15:33] <Pookiedaexzile> Dabs are usually a bit more fruity for me, but it comes down to strain really
[2:15:49] <@SoFarFetched> do you mean Elmo? D:
[2:15:57] <%tizz86> @jekado don't try it raw, I did on first try and it was a mistake! just a little on food enhances everything and adds great flavor
[2:16:02] <%thotbane> @goblinpuppy ***
[2:16:13] <$Sphincter_Spelunker> I think Moobot should be linking the podcast clip of Pat announcing the engagment
[2:16:20] <@Jekado> oh i know i've tried the hot drops raw that was a mistake...
[2:16:24] <+traximus_s> Paige can you ask plague to stream plz
[2:16:42] <@SoFarFetched> plague tends to be busy with real life things, so he streams when he feels up for it.
[2:17:04] <@SoFarFetched> he's gotta tend to his animals
[2:17:12] <+traximus_s> @sofarfetched yeah but it was worth a shot
[2:17:13] <%king_wragles> Licensed music at the end I thought?
[2:17:18] <%tizz86> I tried last dab xxx with a teaspoon and was holding my mouth under the faucet for 5 min LUL
[2:17:18] <%FacetiousAF> fuckin DMCA
[2:17:39] <LifesNeverHumDrum> game looks cool enough, if it feels good to play then that's what matters

[2:20:22] <%OswaldTheDog> Adorable
[2:20:22] <Pesuto> It was okay
[2:20:23] <%thotbane> In the end we truly were the outriders
[2:20:24] <darklurker_dumahiem> Are you behind the grrove Eli?
[2:20:27] <%tizz86> LOUD NOISES
[2:20:31] <Khester824> i likes the shootbangs
[2:20:31] <bettysharkface> It's fiiiine. Not really my kinda jam.
[2:20:32] <peyodogo> very funky game, not super into the tone but the gameplay looks tight
[2:20:33] <Ozavic> It looks alright, we'll see how it goes in the long game
[2:20:33] <@MelBrooksKA> Get a room, get a hose, get the tax breaks
[2:20:33] <Clundy> The outriders of the storm
[2:20:34] <dagreenpillow> Paige has her own streaming room? o;
[2:20:39] <LifesNeverHumDrum> i enjoyed watching you get swarmed by dudes and make no attempt to escape, very cool
[2:20:39] <dan_g_v> it was a joy ride :3
[2:20:39] <$Sphincter_Spelunker> audio mixing needs work. Pat's ice sound effects were loud
[2:20:40] <Pookiedaexzile> I enjoyed watching you play tank with two sniper rifles, Its the fresh content I wake up to see
[2:20:42] <TheZearGuy> Pretty cool. If only I had someone to play with lol
[2:20:42] <Pesuto> I'm worried it'll try to be a Destiny clone with all the issues Destiny has, rather than fix them
[2:20:42] <%juxtest> Im feeling influenced
[2:20:44] <$ZeOrbling> yes very competent
[2:20:47] <@MelBrooksKA> HOUSE
[2:20:49] <+coward_man> this game is pretty cool, I played the demo earlier and I had a load of fun with the Trickster class
[2:20:49] <LifesNeverHumDrum> jk for real tho you did fine lol
[2:20:50] <Sunstalker> Can Eli even play with you two on his net?
[2:20:52] <@MelBrooksKA> house*

[2:21:04] <+toastybites> go on a foam adventure
[2:21:05] <dagreenpillow> Wowy~
[2:21:07] <%TheWinged7> Gameplay looks good, but writing is extra edgy and dumb
[2:21:10] <+coward_man> yeah a bit of sound dampening will help the echo but you sound good
[2:21:12] <%tizz86> just stick skelmo in there to absorb reverb
[2:21:31] <$Sphincter_Spelunker> lower game pls
[2:21:31] <darklurker_dumahiem> coward man....hows the back down?
[2:21:44] <$Sphincter_Spelunker> that works too

[2:21:51] <%OswaldTheDog> I’m grabbing it now, this looks mad fun
[2:21:52] <@MelBrooksKA> Music loud, might wanna switch to big elmo/no sound
[2:21:54] <%tizz86> @sphincter_spelunker LUL
[2:22:08] <@SoFarFetched> yeah probably better to be big elmo mode.
[2:22:09] <afronooch> its a lot better than I'd thought it'd be
[2:22:28] <%tizz86> Paige, BGM overbearing

[2:22:41] <LifesNeverHumDrum> yeah this seems like something you'd pass up seeing at E3 but....it seems fun so
[2:22:43] <$Sphincter_Spelunker> saying Mass Effect is not an RPG huh
[2:22:58] <@PlagueOfGripes> she's been addicted to this
[2:23:16] <@SoFarFetched> yeah I was seeing her discord showing her on outriders for a long while
[2:23:16] <thefunkiestpunkiest> Wait, her NEW fiance? What happened to the old fiance?
[2:23:17] <LifesNeverHumDrum> that's why i like Destiny lol i can do magic if i dont wanna shoot
[2:23:20] <%tizz86> Plague beepboop her for sound?
[2:23:29] <thefunkiestpunkiest> Did she kill the old fiance?

[2:46:34] <%Lion_kun> Balls up my ass was a challenge.
[2:46:34] <$QueequegTheater> @PeachSaliva I mean, it's less weird than beating off to your stream, right?
[2:46:37] <+cvp5127> beating of inside
[2:46:39] <Pookiedaexzile> Fucking and beating off are two different things
[2:46:42] <Hydrapissed> it was the sonic it getts people going
[2:46:44] <%ThomasOfTroy> The sonic only makes it better
[2:46:46] <SiameseSneeze> sonic high school gets people rock hard

[2:59:25] <%SMuffinMan> PURRRRRR
[2:59:26] <%king_wragles> I feel like the reason Gief is on Pat's stream so often is that's where the food lives
[2:59:27] <LifesNeverHumDrum> elmo's stream now
[2:59:27] <%ShockzNDrawe> even I think it's good
[2:59:30] <@MelBrooksKA> I heard purr
[2:59:31] <Thepothero> Yep new raids tend to have content from other games
[2:59:32] <dirtesox> ur dad is the count of st germain
[2:59:34] <+kyh9> main story quest stuff is ez
[2:59:48] <%coward_man> there's A LOT to get through, I've been playing regulrly for a year and just got to the current expansion
[2:59:58] <%king_wragles> Oh ya, one of my friends saw a robot or something in there and yelled at me about Gundams

[3:00:15] <+kyh9> PISS
[3:00:16] <@SoFarFetched> Yeah I barely started in december and barely on heavensward but that's because I played a lot.
[3:00:17] <Zeif00> D:

[3:00:45] <%ShockzNDrawe> actually a) had a dedicated friendgroup to play on like a scheduel
[3:00:45] <Hydrapissed> ah kk
[3:00:46] <+whyskeywolfe> Is there even still a Discord thing for 14?
[3:00:47] <%tizz86> @sofarfetched honestly,  with my profession. Seclusion is required and I'm happy that even tho it may be parasocial, my friends are happy.  I want to support that.
[3:00:51] <+kyh9> I'd definitely watch a Paige FFXIV story stream with Pat in for aid and commentary
[3:00:51] <Hydrapissed> gana say that cat is going ape shit in that office
[3:00:52] <%thejimjamz> peepeepoopoo cat, good cat
[3:00:56] <Thepothero> It’s a grind for sure but it gets fun once you start talking to people I find in FF14
[3:01:03] <peyodogo> thing with 14 is that often the difference between a new person loving or hating it is what class they pick, and that's not exactly an informed decision at the start
[3:01:04] <%ShockzNDrawe> and b) if I had enough motivation to play any other time outside of those times
[3:01:10] <Saltmeisterr> wait is paige still playing?
[3:01:18] <%king_wragles> I think Zombino and SoFar were starting FF14 not that long ago, Shockz

[3:10:27] <%ShockzNDrawe> fill out a form
[3:10:34] <%KeiganOfAstora> Damn, I mean you got time. You're not goin' anywhere :-)
[3:10:40] <%ShockzNDrawe> and then you sit in a room
[3:10:43] <KingKrampus> paige isn't marrying a Canadian, she's marrying a displaced Frenchman
[3:10:44] <Shion963> Whoa echoey
[3:10:45] <@Jekado> @ShockzNDrawe you can just become a naturalized citizen also if you live in the states for 7 years.
[3:10:47] <%ShockzNDrawe> and they stamp yout forehead
[3:10:50] <%ShockzNDrawe> and you become canadian
[3:10:58] <%king_wragles> I guess it's like using mail as proof of residence "ya I live here, I'm married to one of you!"
[3:11:06] <HissingCats> i know in america it helps 70% of the time to get citizenship
[3:11:14] <+whyskeywolfe> Speaking as a dude who works for the feds on this; marriage makes the process more sure but not faster.
[3:11:17] <@MelBrooksKA> MelBrooksKA gifted a Tier 1 sub to KingKrampus! They have given 12 Gift Subs in the channel! 
[3:11:17] <%ShockzNDrawe> Did Elmo break it?
[3:11:22] <coyotezappa> and all the shit that elmo knocked over
[3:11:24] <%tizz86> what about asylum since the US is a shitshow?
[3:11:25] <@Jekado> yeah sound reverb because nothing is absorbing the sound
[3:11:32] <peyodogo> it's really not that echo-y when you're talking straight into the mic
[3:11:33] <Sunstalker> They inject some maple syrup into your spine and then you become a canadian, right?
[3:11:40] <HissingCats> but its still fucky as to what happened with my mom
[3:11:40] <@Moobot> Outriders is neato burrito! Click here to try it! https://i.try.games/outriders/5pl14h
[3:11:43] <LifesNeverHumDrum> yah there's still work to do after marriage, but in the US that does get you pretty far in citizenship
[3:11:47] <%KingKrampus> Holy Crack thank you @melbrookska
[3:11:49] <@Jekado> you can put up drapes and tapestry to absorb the sound reflections.
[3:11:51] <%coward_man> yeah once some furniture is in the room it'll sound better
[3:11:51] <Shion963> or mecha-toilet posthumanity
[3:12:04] <%ShockzNDrawe> So someone asked pat if you legally got his skeleton on his stream and he said you talked about it, and then immedietly switched topics

[3:12:51] <%ShockzNDrawe> Just wear a tablecloth and napkin fuck it
[3:12:52] <%CopperTucker> 100% things are marked up for weddings
[3:12:53] <Shion963> they're super expensive for something you wear once

[3:12:54] <LifesNeverHumDrum> WISH wedding stuf time
[3:12:56] <peyodogo> gotta go, good night and congratulations on the engagement! very happy to see my favorite gingers gettin hitched
[3:12:56] <%Mrbaconator> having stuff specifically called "Wedding XYZ product" is ABSOLUTELY marked up TO SHIT
[3:13:07] <theshillman> i suspect the price on anything with "Wedding" in the mane is jacked to hell
[3:13:09] <@Jekado> Pro Tip wear comfortable sneakers for the wedding
[3:13:10] <%OswaldTheDog> wedding things are mad marked up too.

[3:14:51] <LifesNeverHumDrum> gotta look into some vintage places maybe
[3:15:14] <%OswaldTheDog> you could get a long one and have it hemed?
[3:15:37] <Shion963> jokingly I guess
[3:15:38] <Bigyanno> According to Pat he said "look over there" then got down on one knee when she looked away
[3:15:43] <%KingKrampus> pat should get a wedding right with a gemstone too
[3:15:50] <%CopperTucker> You talked about getting married to Dark Souls music! And a "huge dress that is hard to move in" it is cute
[3:15:52] <LifesNeverHumDrum> he proposed with a gottem
[3:15:54] <@SoFarFetched> "oooh fucking"
[3:16:08] <@MelBrooksKA> It's the middle age aesthetic spyCappa
[3:16:10] <Shion963> like y'all talk about it a lot but not in any specific pointed way
[3:16:14] <bettysharkface> I remember you talking about Australia for the honeymoon and Pat being like nooooooooope.
[3:16:20] <@PlagueOfGripes> ( fibs )
[3:16:25] <%KingKrampus> Pat's wedding ring gemstone could be his madoka or Steven universe gem
[3:16:35] <Pappajimbo> you going to have the ff6 theme to talk down the isle
[3:16:56] <LifesNeverHumDrum> oh don't worry, we know
[3:17:01] <+barrakuta371> awwwwwww
[3:17:01] <%tizz86> it's the camera
[3:17:05] <Shion963> that side is in the orb
[3:17:12] <@MelBrooksKA> It's every now and again
[3:17:16] <%shurtal> he must dunk, to avoid feeling emotional vulnerability in front of us assholes
[3:17:28] <DestroyerPhoenix> tfuLUL we can still see that side of him, don't worry
[3:17:28] <@MelBrooksKA> He puts up a front but we know
[3:17:28] <@SoFarFetched> Pat definitely lets his soft side show.
[3:17:31] <Shion963> yeah yeah comforting pat
[3:17:49] <PleaseCallMeSugar> oh god I remember it
[3:17:56] <@MelBrooksKA> No?
[3:17:57] <@SoFarFetched> oh the Falling Rocks joke?
[3:17:57] <hairtoday> when you make a noise, he snaps to make sure you're okay, it's like a switch flips
[3:18:02] <%ShockzNDrawe> Pat is very soft
[3:18:10] <%coward_man> Pat is super comforting and wholesome but he likes to act like an asshole
[3:18:24] <@SoFarFetched> "I saw a sign saying "falling Rocks" it doesnt"
[3:18:31] <SomersaultJustice> like batman
[3:18:31] <@Jekado> "falling rocks, so the guy started head banging"
[3:18:36] <LifesNeverHumDrum> he's like my dad, when he thinks ur not looking he turns to mush
