[0:22:44] <%Birdigalore> @PeachSaliva Can't you just do sub mode, then make a Room where everyone can speak freely if they dont care for spoilers
[0:22:45] <+terminallyCapriciousz> Paige has become stronger with the GAMER cube
[0:22:46] <MarylandJutsu> From 0-Paige how blind are you
[0:22:47] <laserbeaming> Bans for everybody!
[0:22:48] <BayowolfTerra> had that guy spoiling leaks for GoT in the podcast earlier. that was cool.
[0:22:49] <SGrim> @PeachSaliva you could enable mod chat where posts are reviewed first woopsThink
[0:22:52] <abakkus> get a shitton of mods to go in hard on spoiler protection
[0:22:53] <QaizerArt> oh yeah paige, what @DonatelloJose said, you can actually make a spoiler room @PeachSaliva
[0:22:54] <televisedrevolting> Just Snap and ban 50% of the chat.

[0:23:08] <Frostydough> read the ending so no spoils 5head
[0:23:08] <lightgunfantasic> People who spoil things are people who get their pubic hair braided
[0:23:11] <zamzoph> Danganronpa is also like 30 hours though. For just one game
[0:23:11] <KeiPrime> the smart way to do it would be to record teh whole thing off stream and then show the recording

However, if you do go with English bulldog, please try to find a good breeder who focuses on breeding for the dogs' health rather than just aesthetics. As a lifelong bully owner, they can make any day better but they do come with potentially expensive baggage.

[0:32:23] <%Birdigalore> Urban Dictionary: A term celebrating the removal of one's balls from an anus. Made popular by the infamous 'Booya' video where a man pulls his penis out of his partner's vagina only to reveal that his balls are engulfed inside her brown eye. As he pulls them out, he exclaims 'booya!'

[0:51:35] <blackbeaking> the third one is helping people right?
[0:51:36] <emillionghost> altruism
[0:51:49] <ryome> @QueequegTheater it’s cosmic horror, it has no goal or it is incomprehensible to us
[0:51:55] <+frugglemeister> SLIPPERY MEAT
[0:52:03] <%krawtch> or dont sprint around randomly when someone else triggers a visual indicator
[0:52:04] <%flanchefx> why does he roll his sleeves
[0:52:09] <blackbeaking> does anyone even use slippery meat?
[0:52:10] <%QueequegTheater> look elsewhere

[0:53:04] <GarbageQueenEllie> The Meg
[0:53:04] <%krawtch> probably shouldnt be taking notes from someone squinting at the screen
[0:53:07] <ANoNameIs> Hey Look the game I totally abandoned due to it returning me to my childhood of playing tag and everyone just outpacing me and lying that i didn't tag them when i did!
[0:53:09] <BayowolfTerra> I will say I'm a of ller main, so take any survivors advice I say with a big grain of salt.
[0:53:20] <BayowolfTerra> I'm killer main*
[0:53:28] <prophetdisharmonious> wait a minute, is that why your stream was right after Cahlaflours?
[0:53:30] <erzabet11> does work on freddy
[0:53:30] <SuperFineButtHairs> no one plays freddy
[0:53:33] <SuperFineButtHairs> :(

[0:53:39] <%nameless_majin> sipsipDab sipsipDab sipsipDab sipsipDab sipsipDab
[0:53:40] <krewl123> i play freddy and kill lots
[0:53:41] <%krawtch> legion is like a default killer now
[0:53:42] <+ChaosVulpes> Freddy got fingered...
[0:53:46] <ANoNameIs> is this a leak discussing stream or...?
[0:53:49] <%krawtch> frenzy is fucking worthless
[0:53:49] <krewl123> and then sur complain
[0:53:50] <%TheHylianWolfo> Legion is pretty good
[0:53:51] <+frugglemeister> FeelsBadMan Freddy
[0:53:54] <SuperFineButtHairs> Freddy needs a rework
[0:53:54] <%nameless_majin> Hi Paige!
[0:53:55] <MarylandJutsu> We ARE THE ELMO LEGION
[0:53:59] <erzabet11> spine chill only fails on scratched mirror myers, in my experience
[0:54:00] <%TheHylianWolfo> I win constantly as Legion
[0:54:00] <VJdarkworld> paige in the gamer cube looks like a commander
[0:54:01] <prophetdisharmonious> Legion is for NERDS
[0:54:09] <prophetdisharmonious> Don't be a square
[0:54:09] <blackbeaking> wait what happened to legion? i thought he was good
[0:54:18] <+SWFanatic> apatCrazy
[0:54:20] <%THATGUY_789> is there a Chad surviver?
[0:54:21] <dakuman13> @VJdarkworld lol she does look like a fleet commander
[0:54:25] <%krawtch> i still do well as legion but frenzy is only good for vaulting
[0:54:28] <$HarraceHarrison> Its red because multiple people are working on it, slowing it down
[0:54:34] <BayowolfTerra> there will be an icon on the right side if there's euin after a skill check
[0:54:40] <spectralpants> Ruin just slows the game down..... just a lil bit
[0:54:41] <BayowolfTerra> also this guys gonna lose hard.
[0:54:43] <+VidyaFranX> Pat, the red bar means progress is slowed. That's happening because multiple survivors on one gen
[0:54:46] <+frugglemeister> Pat's minmaxing murder again
[0:54:49] <CeeDee__> just a lil bit
[0:54:51] <%ElenaManetta> i really wish hook screams didn't break the sound barrier
[0:54:56] <$Brother_Coduss> you.........did it
[0:54:59] <%QueequegTheater> Pat doesn't understand how to interact with people unless they're in a skill tree
[0:55:05] <SuperFineButtHairs> mikey
[0:55:07] <%ThePuddingDead> ThePuddingDead subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 6 months! Hey Peach! 6 Months and I'm happy to keep at it. Please hug Elmo, cuz I will be moving soon and I'll have to say goodbye to my Russian Blue, Nero, when he goes with my dad to his new home. I'm gonna miss him, I hope he doesn't forget about me.
[0:55:11] <dakuman13> koopy kills
[0:55:13] <rosemon5001> paige your extremely good only if your enemy is a preggo
[0:55:17] <%JJCheeker> Pat has a cube Fetish
[0:55:18] <%lewdskeletor13> Koopy sandwich?
[0:55:26] <spectralpants> Hag
[0:55:30] <RollCritFail> David Cage!? tomatoFear
[0:55:40] <$UmoLoco> would it be too distracting for Paige if Pat read donations?
[0:55:46] <%krawtch> you'd have heard humming by now
[0:55:47] <%THATGUY_789> when's the greatest of all monsters being added????? Commitment
[0:55:50] <SirSmudgey> Heard a Hag trap
[0:55:50] <BayowolfTerra> it usually is, huh?
[0:55:51] <$HarraceHarrison> Not a passive killer, like time or heart disease
[0:55:55] <@StridentSong> @peachsaliva Red bar means you're not performing the action at 100% efficiency. In the case of multiple survivors working on a generator, your efficiency goes down by 9% per person on the generator. Hence why the bar is red.
[0:55:55] <krewl123> you would have heard her hums
[0:55:58] <%QueequegTheater> You know Cage makes people pronounce it da-VEED like the asshole he is
[0:56:11] <dakuman13> yeet
[0:56:12] <erzabet11> crouch for your life!
[0:56:18] <%QueequegTheater> Play the matchup Paige
[0:56:19] <MarylandJutsu> paige BIG LOVE THE HAAAG
[0:56:19] <BayowolfTerra> just gotta not run when near objectives
[0:56:22] <%starotter70> No
[0:56:25] <%mayorrev> TURN IT UP
[0:56:25] <%krawtch> paige is bad against hag because she sprints places for no reason
[0:56:30] <+SWFanatic> balls in ass?

[0:56:59] <BayowolfTerra> find a gen, quick!
[0:57:00] <%krawtch> THATS A BAD IDEA said the person sprinting to no place in particular
[0:57:07] <blackbeaking> paige fears all woman
[0:57:10] <ANoNameIs> Patrick "I know how to kill" Salvia.
[0:57:11] <%flanchefx> stick em with the pointy end
[0:57:11] <krewl123> i hear hag traps sound
[0:57:13] <BayowolfTerra> I don't think hag, they have ruin to start with.
[0:57:15] <%Gogogolem> The pip system sucks
[0:57:15] <+ChaosVulpes> "You know nothing of survivors!" I know how to kill them...
[0:57:21] <+Diabetic> about to get lit up
[0:57:21] <+frugglemeister> Paige hates the hag because it's a woman she can't kill

[0:59:25] <el_phthalo> RIP big puss, truly the best among us
[0:59:28] <%krawtch> theres nothing in the rules that says a dog cant play football
[0:59:37] <%mayorrev> @PeachSaliva i assume theres perfect skill checks?
[0:59:38] <blackbeaking> these are some great skill checks for a blind woman
[0:59:39] <%Gogogolem> Shes free blood points
[0:59:44] <lupus_man> Airbud as survivor when
[0:59:44] <BayowolfTerra> note: hag has ruin to start with, so either they're new or they are really experienced. probably the former
[0:59:46] <%QueequegTheater> I like how skill checks are literally Gears of War active reloads
[0:59:50] <%ElenaManetta> 15 minutes for a match and two of our teammates disconnected after 1 minute. i blame peachsaliva
[0:59:51] <+frugglemeister> @QueequegTheater That's terrible. Thank you, I'll be using it.
[1:00:10] <%krawtch> @QueequegTheater it would be sick if Bender shouted NICE when you did one tho
[1:00:11] <blackbeaking> @mayorrev there are great skill cheeks which is the little box
[1:00:12] <ANoNameIs> Ruin used to be the main reason to pick up the Hag until the Shrine System came about
[1:00:17] <%mayorrev> ah ok
[1:00:18] <BayowolfTerra> especially since she's not trapping gens.
[1:00:23] <%THATGUY_789> luckily all these survivors have mechanical engineering training
[1:00:24] <%mayorrev> i asssume they speed up things
[1:00:31] <blackbeaking> yeah they do
[1:00:35] <%QueequegTheater> I miss Dom
[1:00:38] <%mayorrev> cool
[1:00:41] <blackbeaking> it repairs faster
[1:00:43] <+VidyaFranX> She can also remove her teleport
[1:00:50] <+frugglemeister> Adrenaline can compensate for an engineering degree
[1:00:50] <Mrman617> Watch out for the spooky triangles
[1:00:56] <krewl123> hag has 2 slowest walking speed
[1:00:57] <+VidyaFranX> Dat bodyblock hag is the hypest
[1:01:13] <SuperFineButtHairs> dis bitch
[1:01:13] <%mayorrev> TOXIC
[1:01:15] <Ion_Laser> Are you fo real?
[1:01:16] <%QueequegTheater> Pat maybe you just suck at Hag
[1:01:19] <blackbeaking> hag is the slowest killer in the game
[1:01:21] <ANoNameIs> @mayorrev Skill checks when succeeded avoid you losing progress, but when Critically succeeded by hitting the crit zone will boost your progress by a bit, but failing pulls it back
[1:01:22] <%krawtch> @QueequegTheater i liked Dom a lot more until almost all his dialogue turned into WARE MAH WIEF
[1:01:27] <+nooseygoosey> blackbeaking nurse
[1:01:29] <Mrman617> Shes not the slowest, Nurse is
[1:01:33] <dakuman13> sneaky sneaks
[1:01:34] <%mayorrev> ohh ok
[1:01:35] <thetruenicster> Be the idiot you want to see

[1:01:48] <%mayorrev> plus failing causes noise as i can tell

[1:08:12] <$jobbedbone> Self care is a destructive concept that encourages you to infantilize yourself.
[1:08:13] <+manwithboxonhead> You know
[1:08:13] <%ElenaManetta> PAiGE NEED SELF CARE BADLY
[1:08:17] <SirSmudgey> We'll Make it is extremely good at tier3
[1:08:23] <BayowolfTerra> same
[1:08:28] <$Zero_Awakening> self care is too strong
[1:08:29] <%QueequegTheater> @krispen_wa I saw somebody put the Packers at #9 in post-draft power rankings this week. That's absurd, right?
[1:08:30] <insaneintentionsyo> silence, liberal
[1:08:31] <+VidyaFranX> Self Care is not that great

[1:08:35] <%MrSuperCasualBoom> cheer200 Evening, Peach Megami Tensei and Patsona. Just want to tell you a nice clean story. Was having Mother’s day lunch with my mom and my two sisters, also mothers, had a silly argument of who the best mom and ended up them playing Mario Kart on the Switch for pride. Then I gave them their gifts which they all wanted. A bag of Japanese Sakura flavored Starbucks coffee for each. Hope you enjoy that story. Now time to watch - Paige “Attempt to” Stares At - cause you need glasses.
[1:08:40] <BayowolfTerra> well, it's not that, but it's sure annoying.
[1:08:40] <%krawtch> nurse's calling is the way to counter that
[1:08:41] <+manwithboxonhead> Paige and your apatBig Gamer Cube.
[1:08:51] <+frugglemeister> Oh shit a dodge button
[1:08:53] <blackbeaking> self care should just be replaced with the jane perk
[1:09:07] <ANoNameIs> Any Ability in the game that actively removes choices for killers/ reduces downtime is a top tier perk
[1:09:12] <+VidyaFranX> You can just use it as a dash towards pallets/windows
[1:09:13] <MarylandJutsu> @MrSuperCasualBoom who won the mario kart?
[1:09:16] <Tasetsu> w h o l e s o m e

[1:09:40] <Mrman617> I use the locker perk and its fun
[1:09:42] <BayowolfTerra> balanced landing is the big vet oerk since it allows near infinite loops on some maps (apparently)
[1:09:50] <%ElenaManetta> Because you skipped gym class, Pat
[1:09:53] <%starotter70> Masturbation is a Sport

[1:09:55] <MarylandJutsu> @mayorrev its only when you come out of the locker

[1:11:05] <CrimsonCore90> @kirby_sauce I cut your face with my knife!
[1:11:07] <%krawtch> maybe its a Colonial Marines xeno
[1:11:07] <$Brother_Coduss> xenomorph would warp between vents
[1:11:08] <%QueequegTheater> It's way too strong and fast at the same time
[1:11:10] <BayowolfTerra> new skeleton, they'll never do it.
[1:11:13] <blackbeaking> xenomorph too strong
[1:11:14] <%krawtch> runs into walls and shit
[1:11:15] <%MrSuperCasualBoom> You know who needs a dodge button...ProJared. 🤣
[1:11:19] <televisedrevolting> Xenomorph: Fast as FUCK BOYE
[1:11:21] <+Shonen_hero> and it can spit acid that can melt through plated metal and plastic
[1:11:22] <%mayorrev> fat
[1:11:22] <@StridentSong> That would be more like Ju-On girl then the xenomorph
[1:11:22] <worldbrand> A xenomorph, but it's already missing two limbs
[1:11:23] <+Diabetic> Make Pinhead and make his hooks be a long range ability
[1:11:23] <VJdarkworld> make it the xenomorph queen
[1:11:26] <Ion_Laser> @MrSuperCasualBoom :D :D
[1:11:27] <+TombstoneTTromboners> add a raptor from jurassic park
[1:11:30] <+MagickBurritoh> It has a walk speed of like 10 mph
[1:11:31] <%rumtumtugnutz> Predator would be better than the Xenomorph.
[1:11:33] <qo_op> damage up the model so it's injured
[1:11:33] <%mayorrev> have a thicc alien
[1:11:37] <ANoNameIs> I actually figured Ghostface would be perfect for that. Like, technically multiple dudes working together
[1:11:39] <%THATGUY_789> they'd have to have a space ship level
[1:11:39] <+TDotGoat> make it a xenomorph with a broken leg
[1:11:42] <%snow_bush> We obviously need a MIMIC killer
[1:11:43] <+SWFanatic> Death waits for the slightest lapse in concentration.
[1:11:45] <%rumtumtugnutz> or easier to work, anyway
[1:11:46] <%krawtch> red light on you, wonder if she sees you
[1:11:46] <%AncelDeLambert> Paige WHY
[1:11:46] <%mayorrev> RUN BILL
[1:11:47] <$thewhiterice92> More speed but require more hits to down
[1:11:48] <$Brother_Coduss> @PeachSaliva isnt the xenomorph too animalistic to be considered a killer?
[1:11:48] <%Kirby_Sauce> @CrimsonCore90 I am here and everywhere at once!
[1:11:52] <%THATGUY_789> top teir
[1:11:52] <%QueequegTheater> @PeachSaliva Paige the xenomorph runs like 40mph

[1:11:58] <+IchBinMiller> @PeachSaliva What if they just say the xenomorph is hurt?
[1:11:58] <3xgilly> how would he hook lmao
[1:11:59] <blackbeaking> love that huntress hum
[1:12:00] <Mrman617> @joneworldbeater Nah. Valve likes to hand their characters to other people sometimes
[1:12:00] <BayowolfTerra> the thing with predator though is that wraith makes him redundant.
[1:12:02] <+unclekulikov> For the alien you should play as the facehugger, and then an NPC Alien grabs the body and takes it to a hook
[1:12:09] <WorldFapRevealed> paige look like dr claw
[1:12:09] <%Remery_> Humming Waifu <3
[1:12:09] <+krispen_wa> Is that Professor Pyg?
[1:12:13] <+VidyaFranX> THERE'S RUIN
[1:12:14] <ANoNameIs> @Brother_Coduss The lore doesn't look for humans, it looks for what can cause and create emotions.
[1:12:14] <NiftyNox> What about the chimpanzees from Congo
[1:12:16] <Mrman617> Oh she got a hex
[1:12:17] <%Kirby_Sauce> Add the bye bye man
[1:12:18] <+Blargimazombie> Raptor is also way faster than human
[1:12:18] <dakuman13> It would run faster if it naruto ran
[1:12:22] <+SWFanatic> Festering fear consumes the mind!
[1:12:23] <BayowolfTerra> Hough you could say that for hillbilly and hey, there's leatherface.
[1:12:25] <+Diabetic> get a predator
[1:12:29] <3xgilly> maybe im just thinking too hard

[1:12:52] <BayowolfTerra> this is turning into a real shitshow
[1:12:52] <%MrSuperCasualBoom> Or get picked up by a flying thing and then dunked into a pool like a donut and eaten by hybrid Dino cause that’s not elaborate.
[1:12:53] <Laecerelius> Wow you guys are just dropping
[1:12:57] <$Brother_Coduss> @PeachSaliva hey pat, have you heard of the new Predator game? it's like this but with predator vs marines
[1:12:59] <ANoNameIs> @Brother_Coduss That's the reason why The entity gives people hope by allowing avenues of escape and items to use, to create more hope for when they get sacced to the spidergod
[1:12:59] <joneworldbeater> @Mrman617 Ok, 'cuz I was like "The fuck is Bill from L4D in this game?"

[1:13:49] <NiftyNox> Leprechaun
[1:13:50] <%AncelDeLambert> this is the greatest example of Barbeque and Chili at work ever
[1:13:52] <joneworldbeater> Naked Patrick Boivon would be very scary
[1:13:52] <%krawtch> that guy is hatch camping probably lol
[1:13:53] <%MrSuperCasualBoom> A naked Pat would be the Dr Seuss Norax thing
[1:13:53] <+Diabetic> anything would be better than Ghostface
[1:13:53] <Ion_Laser> A ghost of Ghostface Killah. Like The Boondocks
[1:13:53] <+frugglemeister> DMX and his killer music is just him barking
[1:13:54] <%snow_bush> ICP Killers when?
[1:13:54] <$Brother_Coduss> @PeachSaliva hey pat, have you heard of the new Predator game? it's like this but with predator vs marines
[1:13:57] <+flying_hipp0> Ghostface Killah got good raps
[1:13:57] <%starotter70> Is there a Vampire Killer yet!?
[1:13:57] <+Estuko> @PeachSaliva you know who'd be great? Suge Knight
[1:14:00] <+miguelrod777> rip this game
[1:14:02] <+ChaosVulpes> Wow, this killer fucked everyone up in record time
[1:14:06] <SulfurousAcid> gg
[1:14:07] <%Gogogolem> @PeachSaliva Its like that person whose super confident was really good at the agme
[1:14:07] <ANoNameIs> Put Mr. X in the game. sbfpPatschwitz
[1:14:08] <dakuman13> Suge Knight would be so good!
[1:14:08] <Madbearv> dracula killer when
[1:14:10] <dadeaner> what about The Blob?
[1:14:14] <insaneintentionsyo> y'all got wrecked
[1:14:14] <ryome> Slug Knight for DBD
[1:14:15] <mistersups> What about the Santa dude from Silent Night Deadly Night?
[1:14:16] <%ElenaManetta> So this is the point of the game where I start to check out, because it's obvious with FIVE GENERATORS TO GO and everyone is injured, you're not gonna make it. But you have to keep playing until it's over or just be an asshole and disconnected
[1:14:16] <DevilDeus13> What about the Ghostface killer from Scary movie instead
[1:14:20] <VJdarkworld> A New Record !
[1:14:20] <%AncelDeLambert> ooooh, a big clanky black knight in this game would be cool
[1:14:22] <%krawtch> camping hatch
[1:14:24] <+SWFanatic> More blood soaks the soil, feeding the evil therein.
[1:14:24] <+LowLatency_> We need ODB as a killer just so we can get a map called Brooklyn Zoo
[1:14:25] <%CantWalkGood> I started playing DBD because of Paige and the survivors keep teabagging me!
[1:14:26] <Dementedpenguin> Rank Reset LUL
[1:14:26] <%ElenaManetta> And that time of just waiting to lose is not fun
[1:14:26] <Laecerelius> Wouldn't the ICP just be a reskin of this killer, throwing axes at people? Maybe add in the clown's bottle throw and reskin it as Faygo
[1:14:31] <%Remery_> Proud to be a Huntress main :)
[1:14:32] <Nina96> no its more like evolve by the looks of it
[1:14:33] <@StridentSong> They can't see the hatch yet
[1:14:34] <%THATGUY_789> what are U doing Paige huh?
[1:14:36] <+DeaconBluesClues> sacrifice your friends to get more time on the clock
[1:14:36] <emillionghost> what do u think of the new killer?
[1:14:36] <+MagickBurritoh> what genre of music is this?
[1:14:39] <ryome> Sug Knight for DBD
[1:14:39] <dakuman13> This music is oppressive.
[1:14:39] <+ArcLifth> Is no generators started so no natch anyways?
[1:14:39] <%MrSuperCasualBoom> Metal Slug + Suge Knight = Metal Slug Knight
[1:14:40] <ANoNameIs> Fucking magnets how do they work?
[1:14:40] <@StridentSong> It doesn't spawn until all 5 generators are done
[1:14:41] <%iwishthiswasicq> I wish that Predator game had a single player focus.
[1:14:43] <%AncelDeLambert> @PeachSaliva Barbeque and Chili won this game HARD
[1:14:43] <BayowolfTerra> no hatch hasn't spawned yet.
[1:14:43] <+nooseygoosey> cobaltCaw cobaltCaw cobaltCaw

[1:15:09] <%QueequegTheater> @PeachSaliva Pat could the Witch of Hemwick from Bloodborne work as a killer
[1:15:09] <Ion_Laser> That crow tried to fuck on me!
[1:15:16] <%THATGUY_789> piss off Brandon Lee

[1:15:53] <%peppertimelady> da bird

[1:16:04] <blackbeaking> spectate
[1:16:11] <GarbageQueenEllie> Why are they running if they're dead?
[1:16:11] <ANoNameIs> Survivors are outragously toxic. I can't count how many times Survivors have gone "YOU DIDN'T WIN" to me after I won a match.
[1:16:11] <CobbySquared> Need 3 gens for hatch as well

[1:20:05] <%starotter70> NICE
[1:20:07] <BayowolfTerra> HELPING
[1:20:09] <%krawtch> should be a killer that is just a Spanish mother of 8 who hits you with a slipper
[1:20:10] <$Solidnick18> bumbled
[1:20:12] <%ElenaManetta> Those skill checks are hard
[1:20:13] <%ElenaManetta> Be nice

[1:20:28] <%mayorrev> arra
[1:20:28] <%SlugNut> SlugNut subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 6 months! Looking good in the cube Peach
[1:20:30] <DraxTD> hide her R-ah
[1:20:30] <BayowolfTerra> yeah, spirits one of the best killers
[1:20:35] <worldbrand> Was that a hatchet in the locker? are those always there?
[1:20:36] <VJdarkworld> ara ara
[1:20:37] <+LowLatency_> Add the Majima Everywhere system in the next update
[1:20:40] <%ElenaManetta> The skill checks are especially hard when your computer lags
[1:20:49] <flyingsnakes3> Majima should be a killer.
[1:20:50] <Madbearv> so when's this punisher looking mother fucker gonna shoot someone
[1:20:50] <%MrSuperCasualBoom> Instead of crows around you, it’s your older sibling tell on you!!! 🤣
[1:20:59] <blackbeaking> @worldbrand yeah hatchets are always in the lockers
[1:20:59] <Mrman617> You open a locker and its Majima
[1:21:15] <$Solidnick18> touch her
[1:21:18] <$Solidnick18> yee
[1:21:18] <worldbrand> @blackbeaking i see, thank ya
[1:21:18] <+LowLatency_> Majima helps you fix the gen and then dropkicks you
[1:21:22] <%krawtch> instead of terror radius heartbeat you just hear Majima giggling
[1:21:22] <+skizzuto> why not use medkit tho
[1:21:23] <%mayorrev> keep crying baby
[1:21:23] <%QueequegTheater> Majima could take Jason on in a fight right
[1:21:24] <+SWFanatic> kiryu-chan!
[1:21:26] <%THATGUY_789> Medicare
[1:21:27] <dakuman13> You get hooked and Majima hails from the skies and takes you up
[1:21:31] <%ElenaManetta> Paige forces drugs down patient's throats because it's faster
[1:21:36] <%QueequegTheater> Like, non-meme Majima
[1:21:37] <%Kirby_Sauce> cheer500 you can totally balance xenomorph. Have it start out as a facehugger, then when you catch a survivor, you evolve to xenomorph, on hook, you revert to facehugger. That and make xeno super light, so those environmental blocks can PIN the xenomorph, so you have to do your own little button mash to get out. Also, there should be a JoJo team shooter. You could even just port over mei's engine into DIO. It totally works. And white album would be like a genji.
[1:21:40] <flyingsnakes3> Majima puts you on a hook and then disco dances.
[1:21:49] <%umbypokochan> they should add Betty White as a killer
[1:21:53] <%QueequegTheater> Kirby that's a good idea
[1:21:57] <$HarraceHarrison> "Gotta get some gens done, BUT FIRST"
[1:21:58] <GarbageQueenEllie> If you pan the camera away during healing, you can pretend naughty things are happening
[1:22:00] <%Kirby_Sauce> Are we allowed to talk about pikachu here?
[1:22:05] <joneworldbeater> They should add Mimics to this game.
[1:22:10] <mattdel92> Paige pink eye confirmed
[1:22:12] <+LowLatency_> Majima is always in break dance style just spinning around the map
[1:22:14] <%ThePuddingDead> DONT U DARE PEACH

[1:22:38] <%krawtch> by using no items, you are wasting them more than by using them up

[1:29:41] <%Kirby_Sauce> cheer500 NO SPOILERS but I saw Pikachu last night. Gotta say, it starts as a pokemon movie, but ends as a smash bros movie. That and I was made the fool when a joke I made revealed I didn't know there was a difference between ryan Reynolds and the guy who plays antman. They're just the same guy in my mind. I CLEARED THIS WITH STRIDENT.

[1:30:34] <Zamorouskiwhich> LUL
[1:30:35] <$Solidnick18> UM
[1:30:37] <%ElenaManetta> This map needs to be deleted from the game
[1:30:38] <ANoNameIs> So fuck Ghostface, seriously, That's the reason I wanted thelocker teleport ability

[1:31:09] <%mayorrev> I NEED HEALING
[1:31:10] <SirSmudgey> How did paige not get poisoned at pointblank range?
[1:31:14] <%QueequegTheater> I NEED HEALING
[1:31:14] <Doofmaster> If paige gets any madder she'll burn a whole city full of innocents
[1:31:16] <%Remery_> This map has the most bugs on console
[1:31:17] <TheZacSuperShow> HEEEEEEAAAAL MEEEE
[1:31:20] <ANoNameIs> Because that actually makes sense for ghostface, and actually means interesting choices and gameplay instead of another jumpscare killer that doesn;t really help with the games issues
[1:31:24] <%ElenaManetta> the POWER OF THREE
[1:31:27] <+aslfrasle> PAIGE NEEDS FOOD BADLY!
[1:31:28] <%krawtch> yeah and all you have to do is repress the button
[1:31:28] <%ThePuddingDead> you were already crouched at the generator hon
[1:31:30] <+Shonen_hero> no
[1:31:34] <%ElenaManetta> You guys are being REALLY exclusion-y to that fourth guy
[1:31:36] <@StridentSong> Ghostface is apparently going to be sometime like Michael Meyers and Amanda's abilities combined
[1:31:42] <%mayorrev> are skill checks random in intervals?
[1:31:43] <%rumtumtugnutz> the surest way to avoid death in a scary movie is to avoid doing the humpty dance.
[1:31:47] <%MrSuperCasualBoom> @rumtumtugnutz I know, I’m just making random fun talk. 🤣
[1:31:51] <%QueequegTheater> Therre's barely any furry porn
[1:31:52] <Mrman617> yeah he can lean around corners too
[1:31:55] <%Reaped_Psyche> Holy crap, Paige is streaming before my next sub came. Is it the holidays already!?
[1:31:56] <$Solidnick18> shit
[1:31:56] <Ion_Laser> Welp...
[1:31:58] <blackbeaking> @StridentSong how is he gonna be like amanda?
[1:31:59] <%starotter70> No space for fences
[1:32:00] <%rumtumtugnutz> @MrSuperCasualBoom Fair.
[1:32:02] <flyingsnakes3> Maybe there's a ham sandwich to eat. hur hur original joke.
[1:32:02] <%SaltyDongs> SaltyDongs subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 13 months! sup
[1:32:03] <ANoNameIs> That's just so boring and not related to his franchise at all
[1:32:04] <GarbageQueenEllie> Because it's not THE FARM
[1:32:07] <%Kirby_Sauce> @dakuman13 settle for kyogre's urethra then
[1:32:08] <joneworldbeater> PlagueOfGripes is a killer in this game too?
[1:32:17] <dakuman13> nooooo
[1:32:18] <%krawtch> @StridentSong well mikey is brutal to play against and amanda is cool so thats good i guess
[1:32:19] <BayowolfTerra> so I barely know plague.
[1:32:21] <$SleepyMaribo> what does the killer puking on you do?
[1:32:24] <%mayorrev> Is this whole map indoors? I like it a lot
[1:32:27] <+Diabetic> Plague is the entity
[1:32:27] <%rumtumtugnutz> Next killer is the TV from Poltergeist.
[1:32:28] <insaneintentionsyo> bwaaa
[1:32:29] <Laecerelius> Aggressive tuba!
[1:32:30] <ANoNameIs> The whole reason Ghostface was cool was the idea of the two killers working in tandem is really threatening
[1:32:31] <marvel877> This makes me want to play The Suffering for some reason.
[1:32:33] <televisedrevolting> Incompetence is a fast and incredibly nefarious killer.
[1:32:40] <%MrSuperCasualBoom> @joneworldbeater he kills you by making sexy beast female drawings of you
[1:32:45] <%starotter70> What's new
[1:32:50] <%mayorrev> eww
[1:32:59] <$HarraceHarrison> schlorp schlorp
[1:33:00] <@StridentSong> He can stalk to reduce his terror radius to near zero, similar to when amanda is crouching
[1:33:00] <%mayorrev> there's vomit tech?
[1:33:03] <%THATGUY_789> gewwww
[1:33:06] <%ElenaManetta> Holy shit the cure sickness goes by so fast
[1:33:06] <Ion_Laser> Eww
[1:33:06] <$Solidnick18> oh no
[1:33:09] <joneworldbeater> @MrSuperCasualBoom Not a furry
[1:33:13] <@StridentSong> So he peeks around corners, then sneaks up on people
[1:33:13] <%ElenaManetta> It went by really slow when I had to do that cleansing shit
[1:33:14] <%QueequegTheater> Poor newblet
[1:33:20] <$SleepyMaribo> how long does it make you puke?

[1:33:30] <worldbrand> pro strats
[1:33:38] <Mrman617> I was hoping Ghostface could hide and teleport/ use the fact that in the first movie he is 2 people
[1:33:38] <$Solidnick18> lol
[1:33:40] <+Diabetic> I hate this map
[1:33:42] <%THATGUY_789> and the threat leaves
[1:33:43] <%krawtch> she will now puke BLUD
[1:33:44] <%MrSuperCasualBoom> @joneworldbeater So it’s not very effective

[1:34:00] <alwayspronking> this game is nothing but monkaS huh?
[1:34:01] <+skizzuto> PLAGUE GUN
[1:34:03] <@StridentSong> Teleporting between lockers would be great for a Ju-On/Grudge killer
[1:34:03] <%Reaped_Psyche> You're the sweetest damn person Paige. Anyone else would have shit all over that sick man.
[1:34:04] <$Solidnick18> GUN
[1:34:04] <%SaltyDongs> Big gun
[1:34:05] <+manwithboxonhead> Anxiety Intensifies
[1:34:06] <+BorinCorran> G U N
[1:34:06] <$SleepyMaribo> wait a GUN?
[1:34:07] <%starotter70> The scariest killer, A GUN
[1:34:08] <$HarraceHarrison> And you gave her that gun! You're the water schlorper!
[1:34:08] <CandideCamera> what if a new killer who just had a gun
[1:34:09] <+SWFanatic> Just like David Cage predicted
[1:34:10] <+miguelrod777> GUN
[1:34:11] <insaneintentionsyo> blat blat
[1:34:12] <%QueequegTheater> GUN GUN GUN GUN
[1:34:15] <NovaKnightmare> GUN MODE
[1:34:16] <a_mad_dragon> plague gun
[1:34:18] <Ion_Laser> GUN GUN
[1:34:21] <Laecerelius> The greatest killer in the game, Guy With Gun! He can insta-down you from infinite range, sometimes through walls and cover!
[1:34:25] <dakuman13> incidental gun tuba music
[1:34:27] <%THATGUY_789> is this the Riot office
[1:34:27] <%ElenaManetta> But a big tall thing IS HARD TO SEE INSIDE A BUILDING
[1:34:28] <+luketrapwalker> how did you see that LUL
[1:34:30] <qo_op> if only there were proactive measures to make you less blind Kappa
[1:34:31] <%krawtch> a gun that shoots GERMS
[1:34:34] <%QueequegTheater> WHO'S GENNING
[1:34:35] <televisedrevolting> @candidecamera It's just a normal guy who has a gun.
[1:34:38] <ANoNameIs> @Laecerelius The Hillybilly is already in the game
[1:34:41] <BayowolfTerra> gens in walls of the map for the most part, just run. perimeter
[1:34:41] <Mrman617> @ANoNameIs Yeah. It would also make it to where you faze out as Billy you then faze in as Stu and your movement would look different or something
[1:34:44] <+Diabetic> the nice thing about Plague is you can heal from injured state on her maps cause you get to bathe in the water.
[1:34:51] <%ElenaManetta> NICE
[1:34:52] <%mayorrev> qq
[1:34:53] <%ElenaManetta> What a hero
[1:34:55] <%krawtch> if only vision had a way of being corrected
[1:34:55] <+manwithboxonhead> Super Power: Gun
[1:34:55] <%starotter70> Great
[1:34:56] <Mrman617> But unfortunately he isn't from the movies and is almost an OC
[1:34:57] <joneworldbeater> @MrSuperCasualBoom super effective on Plague, who is definitely not a furry, despite all evidence to the contrary
[1:35:06] <+ChaosVulpes> Isn't it nice that the plague is inside a hospital?
[1:35:08] <%MrSuperCasualBoom> Gun don’t kill people. Making life changing story where you said you don’t need to kill people in game then install choice to kill people in game kill people.
[1:35:16] <%Remery_> I mean there's a lot of projectile killers a gun killer doesn't sound too far fetched
[1:35:16] <RollCritFail> Okay Worf
[1:35:19] <%krawtch> disconnecting survs is why i main killer
[1:35:20] <insaneintentionsyo> death before dishonor
[1:35:22] <%ElenaManetta> Just do what I do instead and uninstall the game
[1:35:26] <flyingsnakes3> rage quitting is alive and well.
[1:35:28] <benjiFG> again with the balls
[1:35:28] <%ElenaManetta> And then re-install it when you calm down
[1:35:29] <%mayorrev> Paige is awful at the game but at least she can take the L Kappa
[1:35:31] <ANoNameIs> @Mrman617 ... ACtually, holy shit, two killers with different statlines (Billy has a dash, Stu can juke pallets) and the teleport thing would be really rewarding
[1:35:32] <+SWFanatic> present the pepis
[1:35:34] <%snow_bush> You can't stop my ISP Pat! It'll disconnect me if it wants!
[1:35:37] <%krawtch> if survivors are gonna bitch out, i might as well get points for it
[1:35:38] <%THATGUY_789> you never know. loss of power or shitty net
[1:35:40] <+luketrapwalker> best hiding spot
[1:35:42] <%mayorrev> ohh noooooo!
[1:35:43] <BayowolfTerra> noted
[1:35:46] <dakuman13> that's some woolie tech
[1:35:52] <$SleepyMaribo> what does the puke do???
[1:35:56] <%ElenaManetta> I can't tell if Pat was being sarcastic, BECAUSE PAIGE IS STILL ALIVE
[1:35:57] <%krawtch> the best hiding spot is the place they dont look
[1:35:59] <%MrSuperCasualBoom> Woooww no - Paige 2019
[1:36:01] <Cptn_Turtle> How does she find such amazing hiding spots
[1:36:01] <+manwithboxonhead> Stay there forever
[1:36:06] <ANoNameIs> @SleepyMaribo Over time will hurt you, and makes you vomit and make noise
[1:36:09] <NovaKnightmare> just crouch its the easiest way to hide
[1:36:12] <TheTakkster> @SleepyMaribo It makes you thin and pretty
[1:36:21] <Mrman617> @ANoNameIs But then he might be too similar to legion which is ironic because he is just Shape and Pig
[1:36:28] <42nfl19> My power up is A GUN
[1:36:30] <thebestestkevin> oh god look at paige sinking into the cube
[1:36:30] <+VidyaFranX> They also become BROKEN
[1:36:32] <%krawtch> they also cant be healed until they clean up
[1:36:35] <%MrSuperCasualBoom> So Bo Rai Cho tech
[1:36:37] <%THATGUY_789> they need a monster nurse that chases people with a syringe
[1:36:40] <ANoNameIs> I just mean the idea of two different abilities on the same killer across two bodies
[1:36:41] <DracaenaLeaf> two people disconnected rip
[1:36:43] <NovaKnightmare> I just realized Paige is in the cube, thats adorable and hilarious
[1:36:44] <%mayorrev> AAHAHAHA
[1:36:45] <%THATGUY_789> just for pat

[1:37:18] <%THATGUY_789> that's a shitty
[1:37:18] <42nfl19> So dots?
[1:37:18] <+enickma11> What the hell is wrong with these people
[1:37:21] <Dementedpenguin> What a wonderful team Kappa
[1:37:21] <%QueequegTheater> DO IT SHANE
[1:37:22] <42nfl19> THROW MORE DOTS?
[1:37:23] <Mrman617> Does anyone know if Iron Will makes your puking silent
[1:37:28] <+manwithboxonhead> LUL LUL LUL
[1:37:28] <Ion_Laser> SHANE
[1:37:29] <%MrSuperCasualBoom> Is Pat telling a calculus problem?
[1:37:29] <$Solidnick18> people are babies
[1:37:30] <ANoNameIs> So maybe instead it's something like Stu can nab someone at full damage at close range with the restriction of it being a really damn quick struggle meter, and then Billy can do another thing

[1:43:31] <Mrman617> Nurse has a really high skill ceiling
[1:43:32] <+luketrapwalker> same pat
[1:43:33] <%CantWalkGood> Myers is fun, but I can't play him well.
[1:43:38] <BayowolfTerra> he's got the best add-ons for variety
[1:43:39] <%Fuggins4U> play more survivor, you pizza pocket full of fart
[1:43:41] <$FrustratedAF> the pat boivin survivor would only stay in the first house he enters
[1:43:42] <Demerson13> I love when it's free weekend, I play Myers and people just let me stare at them and get lvl 3 off the start of the game
[1:43:42] <%krawtch> i was maining legion and pig, but now apparently im maining survivor because now they both suck
[1:43:45] <%MrSuperCasualBoom> @angriestpat feelings of remake FF7 in “parts”
[1:43:46] <Mrman617> Yes Monitor is the best
[1:43:48] <+king_of_beggars> A Pat Survivor would have a map with Gamer Cubes instead of lockers.
[1:43:49] <chambatron> Are u looking forward to Inocence?
[1:43:53] <televisedrevolting> @elenamanetta That's a kickstarter idea if I've ever heard one.
[1:44:05] <BayowolfTerra> something I like doing is tombstone piece plus dying light, and then killing the obsession.
[1:44:07] <Mrman617> You can kind of reverse that and put on Distressing to confuse people, especially on the smaller maps
[1:44:08] <dakuman13> pat plays survivor when hes playing killer
[1:44:15] <%QueequegTheater> @PeachSaliva Pat if you could go back in time would you change the difficulty of the XCOM 2 LP in either direction?

[2:13:21] <thedepreshun> I love chihuahuas!
[2:13:23] <majindusto> It all depends on the type of dog...Some are just the biggest Assholes
[2:13:23] <+logoth_> My first dog with a chihuahua. He used to lay on my stomach
[2:13:25] <%ThePuddingDead> they were just assholes
[2:13:28] <%QueequegTheater> @ExpendableComicRelief They literally stopped gathering it because it was so inaccurate
[2:13:28] <thedepreshun> I want one so bad!
[2:13:31] <deviljhojho94> Yeah they love biting the little assholes
[2:13:32] <Sloavon> Unfun Fact: Dogs like chew toys because it appeals to their instinct of enjoying the whimpering of dying animals.
[2:13:33] <Danger_douglas> chiluauahs are rats
[2:13:34] <Alseid> yes because they're chihuahuas
[2:13:37] <El_Desperad0> I fucking hate chihuahuas. Tiny little shits are aggressive for no reason
[2:13:37] <MarylandJutsu> JUST LIKE PAT
[2:13:39] <+logoth_> Chihuahua's get attached to a single person really well
[2:13:42] <$Corporate_Redeemer> Paige are you using DED ARD
[2:13:42] <thedepreshun> Just an ugly little fucking goblin
[2:13:43] <%ElenaManetta> Why do you always get the fast matches
[2:13:47] <zamzoph> Paige is like that Azumanga character
[2:13:47] <+linSP> the smaller the being, the more concentrated the anger
[2:13:48] <carlosmanriquez> this is just the way of the chihuahua
[2:13:48] <+linSP> just like pat
[2:13:49] <frozenottsel> I love my chihuahua
[2:13:50] <+redstonej> why do you keep getting bit by dogs
[2:13:50] <el_phthalo> Russian blues are the happy cat meme breeds.
[2:13:51] <Alseid> @El_Desperad0 look at pat and you'll know why
[2:13:53] <BaronVonMagpie> non-mutant chihuahua are cool. they have less rage in them
[2:13:53] <HumanGiant13> Chihuahuas are often mean
[2:13:58] <ExpendableComicRelief> @QueequegTheater you sure?
[2:14:06] <Jayschroo> Chihuahuas are the worst lmao
[2:14:08] <+dukenux> my neighbor had an incredible annoying miniature pinscher
[2:14:13] <fearhurst> I had shih tzu, and now I have 5 cats and an American Bulldog
[2:14:15] <%ThePuddingDead> apparently Corgis are fuckin loud and obnoxious since they are based on hunting dogs
[2:14:16] <%krawtch> small dogs are shit
[2:14:16] <%starotter70> The only Chihuahua I've met was super skiddish
[2:14:19] <PraiseHemra> muh lieage
[2:14:20] <$KnivesEve> i personally like german sheperds
[2:14:21] <rosemon5001> literally cant
[2:14:21] <%waltzqueen> ......dog racism?
[2:14:22] <deviljhojho94> Pure Mexican chihuahuas are nicer, your californian goblins are fucked
[2:14:26] <%ThePuddingDead> a corgi would be cool, but out doors only
[2:14:27] <%MightyMaxT> Would you say some lineages are destined to go Mad?
[2:14:28] <$Totally_not_toby> corgis are assholes too lmao
[2:14:28] <%mrberserker97> mrberserker97 subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 13 months! 
[2:14:31] <%Djinnazz> Chiwawa's are awuful, never get one.
[2:14:34] <insaneintentionsyo> dogey
[2:14:35] <+dukenux> on the other hand, my other neighbors had a mutt and a border collie, and they're sweet doggos
[2:14:35] <%king_wragles> Dogs are diverse as people, breed determines a fair bit but does not mean they'll meet expectations
[2:14:36] <$Totally_not_toby> fighting dogs be fighting dogs
[2:14:37] <Sloavon> fuck chihuahuas
[2:14:40] <%krawtch> they act like fucking pricks and if you punt one 50 yards, suddenly you're the asshole
[2:14:40] <%MaximumDaximum> You know which dogs are amazing? Basset Hounds. They're loud as fuck though, lol.
[2:14:44] <SchroedingersFerret> Paige wants one of those bourgie Ventrue dogs.
[2:14:46] <thedepreshun> Chihuahuas are fucking dumbasses they need to be protected
[2:14:51] <%Kirby_Sauce> Noodle was a DOG
[2:14:54] <majindusto> BIOMUTANT
[2:14:58] <GarbageQueenEllie> Doggo racism
[2:14:58] <%QueequegTheater> @ExpendableComicRelief Yes. Victims of trauma are notoriously susceptible to cognitive bias and poor short term memory. Thus, because they're told pitbulls are violent, they would overreport pit breeds
[2:14:58] <El_Desperad0> Get a nanny doggo, like a Pitbull. Sneak one over the border
[2:15:00] <nooblord_derpington> Omg Pat Lat you use his Cube?!
[2:15:01] <+DuskSymphony01> all the shi tzus i've met have been super sweet
[2:15:02] <%Kirby_Sauce> A PROPER DOG
[2:15:02] <ExpendableComicRelief> i met a really sweet old chihuahua and then two very annoying chihuahuas and one pomeranian
[2:15:02] <%Kavtech> I had a Jack Russel/Chihuahua that never bit, sure as fuck barked it's head off though.
[2:15:03] <+camodikk> chihuahua x Pug is great
[2:15:06] <rosemon5001> animal breeders are the second worst kind of people
[2:15:16] <insaneintentionsyo> too many animals put down :(
[2:15:16] <MarylandJutsu> BIG SCREAM
[2:15:21] <thedepreshun> Never get a pug
[2:15:23] <Yuntalenko> I do wonder if it'd be easier to be certain a dog's chill by adopting an old boy from a reputable shelter who's pre-trained, there's a bunch of those. that said, yeah, phobias are phobias
[2:15:23] <%king_wragles> Hey, HEY
[2:15:23] <fearhurst> CAW
[2:15:23] <Dakuu75> this game has loot to pick up? never noticed
[2:15:28] <Dio_TR> @angriestpat Yo Ralith is streaming shout him out
[2:15:28] <$RC_S3kshun8> whoa wait is @PeachSaliva 's character the Punisher?!
[2:15:28] <%ThePuddingDead> I once was friends with this neighborhood dog who was I think a golden retriever/spitz mix and I named him McCloud, that dog liked me even though he wasn't mine
[2:15:30] <+MechaBaphomet> Puppy mills are the worst
[2:15:33] <%krawtch> might have gotten grabbed thru a window
[2:15:35] <dakuman13> monkaS
[2:15:39] <dakuman13> TUBA
[2:15:41] <$Corporate_Redeemer> Huntress with insta-hatchets
[2:15:46] <juxtest> Brittany Spaniels are the goodest dogs ever
[2:15:47] <%king_wragles> Dean NEEDS to be a survivor
[2:15:50] <%king_wragles> or Cass
[2:15:52] <+StooEsq> majinoCaw
[2:15:53] <suikudo> what the fuck is a puppy mill?
[2:15:53] <BaronVonMagpie> my dad used to breed Afgans
[2:15:54] <GarbageQueenEllie> Big doggos look so cool, I want to chill with them in a pile
[2:15:54] <%QueequegTheater> DO NOT GET DOGS FROM PET SHOPS
[2:15:57] <BaronVonMagpie> it was weird
[2:15:59] <%krawtch> that was a vault i think
[2:16:04] <%QueequegTheater> PET SHOPS GET THEM FROM MILLS
[2:16:04] <BaronVonMagpie> running rug dogs
[2:16:09] <Laecerelius> Eli is comin for ya!
[2:16:12] <%ThePuddingDead> Mills?
[2:16:14] <%CantWalkGood> Is killer really harder than survivor?
[2:16:15] <SirSmudgey> You can't grab windows unless they're injured
[2:16:21] <El_Desperad0> Pet shops also feed them horrible and unhealthy shit
[2:16:25] <%QueequegTheater> @CantWalkGood Depends on the survivors
[2:16:25] <frozenwaifu> but we're not on a farm!
[2:16:26] <CandideCamera> p i g
[2:16:32] <a_mad_dragon> it's a man, duh
[2:16:37] <%QueequegTheater> @ThePuddingDead Puppy mills
[2:16:37] <insaneintentionsyo> I want a maincoon kitten
[2:16:37] <%krawtch> you can interrupt grab any time
[2:16:39] <SpaceGuntank> its the pig, cladette had the headgear
[2:16:41] <hntronium> !uptime
[2:16:41] <$Kataguro> Paige should play Killer more to learn this
[2:16:43] <+BakedPretzels> wait are they not talking about plague of gripes when they've been saying plague
[2:16:48] <%QueequegTheater> Don't look it up if you're having a good day
[2:16:49] <dakuman13> she cant see them pat shes blind
[2:16:49] <%king_wragles> @CantWalkGood I think it's more map dependent as killer
[2:17:02] <$Corporate_Redeemer> Amanda has cosmetics now and it's great
[2:17:08] <Nina96> trying to figure out who the killer is is always my fav part
[2:17:08] <%king_wragles> I really need to play this more to tell
[2:17:09] <ExpendableComicRelief> @QueequegTheater Not how it works. Pitbulls are notoriously bought and trained by people who are generally violent or with ill intentions and all it took was one quick google search for me to find out it was discontinued because they just decided to stop. Pitbulls are an aggressive breed and commit a shit tone of violence against people, both because of their genetics and their socialization. They have a place in society and can be trained to be lovely dogs, but don't deny they are violent.
[2:17:12] <hntronium> Boys how long has paige been playing?
[2:17:17] <ExpendableComicRelief> shit i shoulda sent that in pms
[2:17:17] <SirSmudgey> Pat you can go in lockers to avoid BBQ
[2:17:21] <BayowolfTerra> ah fuck it I'll donate.
[2:17:26] <+TamaskaLem> Nothing too Ignant
[2:17:30] <afronooch> !uptime
[2:17:33] <BayowolfTerra> ...how do I donate?
[2:17:35] <$Kataguro> All these fucking crows
[2:17:41] <+TamaskaLem> Or ignatt
[2:17:42] <inderf> breeders said that breeders are the best way? shocker
[2:17:45] <Jayschroo> You excited for Ghostface?
[2:17:47] <+redstonej> get some fish they wont bite
[2:17:59] <+Shonen_hero> Trainers
[2:18:01] <carlosmanriquez> @PeachSaliva dogs are good, a dog will be petted and that will be good, this is all the knowledge that is needed
[2:18:02] <+Shonen_hero> not breeders
[2:18:04] <CandideCamera> professional piggie
[2:18:06] <fearhurst> Pitbulls have to strong a jaw to not be violent, popping car tires with ease
[2:18:11] <Sloavon> who knew that teeth could be used to bite people?
[2:18:13] <nooblord_derpington> Can you give Elmo a pet for me? CoolCat
[2:18:14] <Dakuu75> @Jayschroo pat and woolie were talking about ghostface on the podcast a few hours ago. dunno how paige feels
[2:18:17] <goddamndavid> damn this killer is dumping dick
[2:18:18] <BaronVonMagpie> I wouldnt say you said anything terribly ignorant, im just of the opinion that dogs aggressiveness is shaped much more by how theyre raised than what their parents pedigree is
[2:18:19] <ExpendableComicRelief> @Shonen_hero but pat is preganto so they're breeders Kappa
[2:18:20] <%starotter70> wow
[2:18:22] <%Gogogolem> @PeachSaliva If you want a sweet baby who will need lots of attention and love get a Labrador.
[2:18:24] <El_Desperad0> @fearhurst that's a lie
[2:18:30] <BayowolfTerra> had a juicer target
[2:18:31] <suikudo> Wow!
[2:18:31] <$Totally_not_toby> chat be like "he's done eating children he's good now"
[2:18:37] <%QueequegTheater> @ExpendableComicRelief Correlation does not equal causation. it bulls bought from a fucking cartel are going to be violent. 50% of homicides in the U.S. are committed by 7% of the population (black males). Does that make black men inherently violent? No, because it ignores basic statistical content
[2:18:45] <Jayschroo> @Dakuu75 thanks I dont watch em live I listen to em while grinding in games
[2:18:46] <DrBeanie> get a samoyed
[2:18:55] <ExpendableComicRelief> @QueequegTheater I'll PM you.
[2:18:55] <$Totally_not_toby> D E S P I T E
[2:18:55] <NumbusPlays> her WHOLE face?
[2:19:00] <+redstonej> FACE/OFF
[2:19:05] <$Corporate_Redeemer> Get a Deustchaud or whatever they're called. They're the "wiener dogs" and they're adorable and extremely loyal. My gramps had one that recently passed away but wherever my grandpa would go, he would follow no matter what.
[2:19:07] <BayowolfTerra> man, real lucky on this game
[2:19:11] <Sloavon> did they kill it?
[2:19:12] <+tigerfang86> FACE OFF
[2:19:13] <suikudo> People who like dogs like dogs to godamn much
[2:19:15] <Zereaux> also pits have not build it up or like indicator they just snap
[2:19:15] <%king_wragles> @PeachSaliva sometimes dogs go nuts. That actually happens
[2:19:20] <Dakuu75> Paige putting that white mage work in
[2:19:23] <fearhurst> How is it a lie when there are videos of some guy with a tire swing making them cling onto the tire
[2:19:30] <Badgerconda_> individual dogs can sometimes just be assholes, sadly. I don't really subscribe to the... 'bad breed' belief, but once in a while you have a dog that's just kind of a dick, like people.
[2:19:31] <%krawtch> that run again.
[2:19:31] <+unclekulikov> It kind of looked like you were dousing the other survivor with gasoline
[2:19:36] <BayowolfTerra> you hesitated
[2:19:42] <%CantWalkGood> how does the pig work?
[2:19:43] <+tigerfang86> well
[2:19:46] <+tigerfang86> it didn't work
[2:19:48] <+Shonen_hero> @suikudo I could say the same about cat people
[2:19:48] <%flanchefx> backseat
[2:19:48] <Sloavon> well you were wrong paige
[2:20:02] <+redstonej> working breeds have a lot of energy way more than people expect
[2:20:15] <+mugwugsampoo> It's not a coincidence that any site advocating for Pitbulls list dog bite fatalities and not numbers of dog bites
[2:20:15] <BaronVonMagpie> course sometimes you get dogs with neurological problems that can cause violence
[2:20:15] <Niney_Who> Samoyeds are instagram dogs
[2:20:17] <BayowolfTerra> they do a little bit, not near as much I think
[2:20:17] <$Totally_not_toby> we have a dachshund she's great
[2:20:17] <dakuman13> did the game audio die
[2:20:19] <$RC_S3kshun8> @PeachSaliva Keeshond's are like mini husky floofer babies too
[2:20:20] <gorillahandz> hey chat, hey Paige, hows it hangin
[2:20:22] <Nina96> is trying to escape the hook bad?
[2:20:23] <fearhurst> a dingo
[2:20:24] <suikudo> @Shonen_hero Sure but all this horse shit about breeds and the way they act
[2:20:27] <a_mad_dragon> sled dog breeds are usually nuts though
[2:20:32] <%starotter70> @gorillahandz Hey
[2:20:34] <Dalaigh> rooHi
[2:20:36] <+El_Tacobandito> yeah game audio died for me while she was on hook
[2:20:39] <Pallion_> gen jockey time
[2:20:41] <suikudo> animals are animals they bite shit and piss
[2:20:41] <$Brother_Coduss> had to step away, what's paige's character wearing on his head?
[2:20:47] <%krawtch> trying to escape is usually bad, because you have a 4% base chance to succeed and a max of 3 attempts at it before you put yourself in phase 2
[2:20:52] <+tigerfang86> EYES SUNDOWNING
[2:20:57] <Dakuu75> is the trap cutting him while he's doing that?
[2:20:57] <suikudo> you got bit by a beast and expect anyone to be shocked?
[2:21:04] <blackbeaking> @brother_coduss it’s a reverse bear trap
[2:21:05] <OldOnyx> meh, I haven't really seen or heard of pits just snapping for reason. They need exercise and can't be treated as a lap dog
[2:21:08] <BayowolfTerra> @nina96 for the most part yes. it's a 4% chance if success and takes a big chunk outta the guage if it fails
[2:21:09] <dakuman13> need more eyes on the inside
[2:21:10] <suikudo> the fuck do people think dogs come from anyway
[2:21:13] <$ClockUp> ddvgMagikarp ddvgMagikarp ddvgMagikarp
[2:21:14] <carlosmanriquez> @PeachSaliva i had a labrador for 14 years up to last year and she was the most loyal, sweet and kind dog i've ever known, get a labrador
[2:21:14] <$Corporate_Redeemer> Literally OMEGALULS you
[2:21:15] <OldOnyx> *for no reason
[2:21:20] <+Shonen_hero> I mean, that's incredibly ignorant of how breeding works suik but sure
[2:21:22] <%MaximumDaximum> @blackbeaking So it frees bears?
[2:21:24] <+FoolsArcade> you passed one
[2:21:24] <$Kataguro> Blind
[2:21:32] <SirSmudgey> Blind
[2:21:34] <+reddpop_> it's harder to see as the sun go down
[2:21:35] <%waltzqueen> sipsipSipsipblind sipsipSipsipblind
[2:21:35] <GarbageQueenEllie> You should get a dire wolf
[2:21:37] <+Binary_Fireball> the bigger the doggo the better
[2:21:37] <rosemon5001> that laugh spooked me because i thought someone was behind me and pushed my funny button
[2:21:39] <hntronium> Did she pass the one on person?
[2:21:43] <gorillahandz> oof
[2:21:45] <+Binary_Fireball> I want a giant fucking woofer
[2:21:45] <%mayorrev> oh wait this game has SAW stuff?
[2:21:47] <%umbypokochan> get a dumpster dog
[2:21:49] <Ion_Laser> Finished? :D :D :D :D
[2:21:50] <suikudo> it doesnt matter how they are bred they are still animals they do what they do
[2:21:50] <King_Krimzon> He totally did.
[2:21:51] <$RC_S3kshun8> Pat he's not writing shit anymore he is DONE
[2:21:52] <dakuman13> he's too busy playing idolmaster
[2:21:52] <BayowolfTerra> nah, he just not doing it.
[2:21:52] <rosemon5001> MASSIVE lies
[2:21:56] <majindusto> CALLED IT
[2:22:00] <%Reaped_Psyche> Tibetan Mastif
[2:22:02] <$Kataguro> Rip Hookman
[2:22:02] <blackbeaking> @maximumdaximum yes it allows bears to become even more powerful
[2:22:04] <BayowolfTerra> real talk, that man's gonna die before the series is over.
[2:22:04] <$RC_S3kshun8> He made his money "seeya on the spin-offs fuckers!"
[2:22:07] <Nina96> he totally has and hes just waiting on the show
[2:22:07] <BaronVonMagpie> solution: get shelter dog the size of elmo
[2:22:09] <CandideCamera> pig is cute
[2:22:11] <$Corporate_Redeemer> Third one is guaranteed methinks
[2:22:13] <ExpendableComicRelief> lma queequeg is seething so hard
[2:22:14] <zamzoph> SourPls She's a demon on wheels SourPls
[2:22:14] <$Totally_not_toby> george r r martin is just sitting on a pile of money while saying like "ooooh im soooo disappointed in the way hbo is treating my characters"
[2:22:14] <gorillahandz> he's gonna drop em the second the last episode comes out to immensely negative reviews
[2:22:16] <$FrostMass22> GRRM's legacy will be a shit tv show and that's pathetic
[2:22:19] <%mayorrev> Which killer is this? and does everyone have a head brace? @PeachSaliva
[2:22:22] <+heliosvaporizer> rooBooli hurry
[2:22:22] <ExpendableComicRelief> @QueequegTheater cant handle facts mate?
[2:22:31] <gorillahandz> be all like "ayy guys hate that shit? check this out"
[2:22:32] <%ElenaManetta> I thought that was Paige doing the Tim Allen grunts the whole time
[2:22:35] <blackbeaking> @mayorrev it’s Amanda from saw
[2:22:38] <$Totally_not_toby> meanwhile he's flossing with 100 dollar bills. I don't know how that works but he's doing it
[2:22:42] <%emoonimoo> I hope he does finish them, because I have so many mixed feelings on season 8
[2:22:42] <Ion_Laser> Even if Martin was done, he has a bunch of tales of dunk and egg short stories to work on
[2:22:44] <%krawtch> the box cuts you with razors that were washed but then left out to dry on a dishrack
[2:22:45] <BayowolfTerra> @mayorrev the pig (from saw) she's got sneak attack crouches and can put a timed trap on your head

[2:31:18] <dakuman13> yeah this is definitely BM
[2:31:25] <El_Desperad0> @Brother_Coduss they shed a lot throughout the year, and unlike other breeds you HAVE to keep a very balanced diet for it. You also have to exercise it a lot and play with it, otherwise they'll be destructive. It's like owning a baby, or a shorter Pat
[2:31:28] <Pallion_> they're farming blood points
[2:31:29] <BayowolfTerra> it's technically against the rules, yes.
[2:31:33] <televisedrevolting> @dakuman13 BM?
[2:31:33] <Nina96> @mayorrev it will only appear when everyone else is dead or esc and they get 1 shot
[2:31:33] <%emoonimoo> What is happening?
[2:31:34] <gorillahandz> he's gotta jerk off
[2:31:36] <%MrSuperCasualBoom> cheer200 Back when I was a 10 year old, my friend’s dog at a BBQ playfully jump on me and suddenly out of nowhere bit me in the face and cause a minor scar on my nose. It took me the next several years to get over it, I couldn’t even pet any dog and that finally came to pass because my family got our lovely dog jack terrier chihuahua Lola. Anyway, I can’t wait for you to play Ace Attorney. I can picture every “Objection!” be you pointing randomly at something and saying whose talking!?! 😁
[2:31:36] <$Corporate_Redeemer> She's either farming and/or trying to go up in ranks since the ranking system was fucked in that both Killers and Survivors have to throw the game for each other and still win in order to go up in ranks. It's dumb.
[2:31:46] <%krawtch> this is code for dumping mega ass
[2:31:48] <dakuman13> Pat is going to go eat candy in the closet dont trust him

[2:32:04] <%ElenaManetta> NOBODY is going for that last generator
[2:32:07] <%Reaped_Psyche> I have a kings size bed that was essentially a twin because of how much laundry was on it.
[2:32:08] <majindusto> PAT IS ABANDONING US BibleThump
[2:32:13] <%krawtch> when it gets cold in the winter i put the clean laundry on top of my bed and sleep under it
[2:32:15] <gorillahandz> than god he's gone. alrght elmo get on the mic
[2:32:16] <suikudo> Make the clothes and fold the bed
[2:32:23] <shurtal> Fold clothes on stream. Hypest clothes folding on Twitch
[2:32:26] <CharlesRobinJr> is she using the CUBE
[2:32:33] <$RC_S3kshun8> The killer is high on mustard.
[2:32:37] <%iwishthiswasicq> Clearly they're RPing.
[2:32:37] <BayowolfTerra> nah, she just farming.
[2:32:39] <+yoshkosh20> play with your friends. stab them in the back
[2:32:39] <$Totally_not_toby> paige how are you enjoying the cube
[2:32:39] <stranger59> Once the bed has enough clothes on it, just abandon it and buy a new bed.
[2:32:51] <%mayorrev> @Nina96 that could work, i'm thinking like 3 - 5 shots total and the fire rate rate is slow
[2:32:59] <dakuman13> @televisedrevolting you know: when an opposing player is beast-styling on you super hard because they know they're going to win
[2:33:03] <gorillahandz> is this super prevalent cuz i've been thinkin of trying this game out but not if people just. won't play
[2:33:05] <majindusto> Paige is in the Judgement Free Zone, Yes!
[2:33:07] <%mayorrev> so the killer has a chance to attacc\
[2:33:19] <%ThePuddingDead> uh buh WUH!?
[2:33:21] <$Kataguro> This is really boring
[2:33:25] <$SleepyMaribo> wtf is this killer doing?
[2:33:25] <shurtal> wtf?
[2:33:27] <CharlesRobinJr> wait what
[2:33:30] <joneworldbeater> clip
[2:33:30] <Jayschroo> farming time
[2:33:32] <$Totally_not_toby> we can all be friends everyone
[2:33:34] <Laecerelius> Fix this shit, peasants!
[2:33:35] <$Totally_not_toby> love wins
[2:33:36] <EMP_SaltyMan> Wack
[2:33:38] <NumbusPlays> point farming
[2:33:41] <Pallion_> not kindness really, blood point farming
[2:33:43] <%MrSuperCasualBoom> Pat: “I’m leaving” *Pat runs away like the Dead by Daylight results screen* 🤣
[2:33:43] <%rumtumtugnutz> Killer and white pants are friiends I bet
[2:33:44] <%ThePuddingDead> lol
[2:33:45] <BayowolfTerra> it's cuz they can teabag back, it relives the tension.
[2:33:45] <+yoshkosh20> I knew an amanda once. she threw a bucket at me.
[2:33:46] <Laecerelius> She was chosen!
[2:33:51] <+DihyDroxy1> lol
[2:33:52] <%iwishthiswasicq> She just likes to hold her.
[2:33:53] <Sloavon> "this is my woman now"
[2:33:55] <+Nobrev> just go for the win
[2:33:56] <stranger59> I like to kill everyone except the last, who gets dropped at the hatch.
[2:33:57] <Dakuu75> anytime I watch these streams, it makes me think "I hope to find girlfriend that's cool with us calling each other a 'dumbass' and 'stupid bitch' lol"
[2:33:58] <dakuman13> she's just a walking troll face
[2:33:59] <$RC_S3kshun8> @PeachSaliva Maybe they were rekking survivors too hard and decided to just buff everyone's XP
[2:34:00] <%ThePuddingDead> wow thats.....really nice
[2:34:03] <%king_wragles> @PeachSaliva ya, she got most of you guys to 2 hooks really quick and then started point farming with yous
[2:34:05] <fairore> paige
[2:34:07] <%AncelDeLambert> what is even happening
[2:34:13] <Sloavon> paige being sniped
[2:34:17] <$Corporate_Redeemer> Farming. Killers grab and let survivors wiggle off so that survivors get extra points.
[2:34:18] <frozenwaifu> what in the goddamn
[2:34:19] <$Kataguro> Collusion
[2:34:19] <OldOnyx> I don't understand the things that are happening on my screen
[2:34:19] <+windsoc> reminds me of the ol mw2 boosting days
[2:34:20] <BayowolfTerra> it's turned into a farm match
[2:34:20] <Nina96> farming is happening
[2:34:21] <suikudo> Big point farm
[2:34:24] <joneworldbeater> this is the big dumb
[2:34:28] <$SweetCheeksTrap> hey!
[2:34:32] <gorillahandz> no they're just grinding for nukes
[2:34:40] <dakuman13> killer maybe sniper or just big beefy farm
[2:34:43] <%AncelDeLambert> and now for the DEATH
[2:34:49] <Scorian> LUL
[2:34:50] <$Totally_not_toby> come on dude
[2:34:52] <deviljhojho94> Oh noooooo
[2:34:52] <Ion_Laser> :D
[2:34:53] <Jayschroo> LMAO
[2:34:53] <Quigsies> LUL
[2:34:53] <MrDonTacos_> F
[2:34:53] <$Kataguro> Hahahahahaha
[2:34:54] <joneworldbeater> YEYEYEYEYEYE
[2:34:54] <Pallion_> NOED
[2:34:55] <BayowolfTerra> she opened the door
[2:34:57] <+cheeseburgerprince> atpSpiner atpSpiner atpSpiner
[2:34:59] <thetruenicster> Cucked
[2:35:01] <$Corporate_Redeemer> GAME OVER
[2:35:01] <juxtest> Now shes gonna go ham
[2:35:06] <suikudo> Almost got away with it
[2:35:06] <$Kataguro> Should've smashed those totems
[2:35:07] <dakuman13> granted, they gave you plenty-o-chances
[2:35:07] <%krawtch> HEEL TURN
[2:35:07] <%MaximumDaximum> Is it not kind of bad that the point system in this game motivates people to play this way?
[2:35:09] <$Totally_not_toby> bitchass
[2:35:10] <Sloavon> WutFace
[2:35:12] <BayowolfTerra> yeah, can't complain
[2:35:16] <frozenwaifu> HEEL TURN
[2:35:20] <%QueequegTheater> yes
[2:35:22] <EMP_SaltyMan> This games community is weird
[2:35:23] <gorillahandz> absolutely
[2:35:24] <%ElenaManetta> It wasn't a FUN match though
[2:35:27] <%galaxyswirl> YES
[2:35:33] <gorillahandz> that looks dull as fuckin shit
[2:35:33] <+mugwugsampoo> Kappa
[2:35:37] <+DihyDroxy1> it is
[2:35:37] <dakuman13> this is just players breaking the game, not the game's fault tbh
[2:35:47] <%MrSuperCasualBoom> The points do not matter.
[2:35:57] <Dakuu75> @dakuman13 yep, sounds right
[2:36:01] <inderf> generally the animosity between killers + survivors means they dont do it
[2:36:05] <BayowolfTerra> blood points matter, they get you upgrades
[2:36:07] <coke_monster> Ganes can be made to be less likely to he broken @dakuman13
[2:36:09] <%king_wragles> You can farm like this, and it's good points
[2:36:14] <$Corporate_Redeemer> The ranking system was nerfed super hard. If a killer has a flawless game they actually get deranked.
[2:36:16] <Dakuu75> not entertaining for US-chat but, it was fun for paige I imagine
[2:36:29] <%starotter70> It's a waste of good suffering
[2:36:31] <Nina96> i still liked it
[2:36:38] <gorillahandz> I mean Dead by Daylight looks fun when people play the game but if people have to point grind like that then woof
[2:36:42] <%galaxyswirl> @Corporate_Redeemer Thats fukin dumb
[2:36:45] <insaneintentionsyo> was world breaking, but funny
[2:36:52] <+Blargimazombie> I only see maybe one and a half per stream
[2:36:54] <BayowolfTerra> its not fun for killers, but sometimes I'll do it if there's multiple DC's as a consolation prize.
[2:36:54] <dakuman13> @coke_monster yeah, but player ingenuity usually finds a way
[2:36:55] <$Corporate_Redeemer> It was a farming match. It's not much but it's honest work.
[2:36:59] <$Kataguro> Now you don't have to play David ever again
[2:37:20] <+patriotrenegade> U win yet
[2:37:23] <Jayschroo> Have you considered playing with viewers in Kill Your Friends matches?
[2:37:26] <Nina96> dont have a exp system if u dont want players to grind
[2:37:29] <$serpenttucker> Seems like there is an inherent problem with a game where players are more inclined to make numbers go up instead of properly engaging in the intended gameplay.
[2:37:31] <Sloavon> smash that like button
[2:37:38] <gorillahandz> are ya winnin paige
[2:37:39] <%krawtch> i unlocked self care and got tier 1 but tier 2 wont fucking appear
[2:37:48] <+VidyaFranX> Paige, you could just use Dead Hard as a dash towards windows/pallets if you're worried about timing
[2:37:53] <TotallyAHacker> sub sundays?
[2:37:57] <%QueequegTheater> So self care is a perk what about after care for healsluts
[2:37:59] <+patriotrenegade> ARE YA WINNIN’ SON??
[2:38:00] <%king_wragles> Can't you set up a password protected party?
[2:38:02] <Dakuu75> don't let the chat into your games, it's like a parasite, it'll kill you from the inside out, lmao
[2:38:04] <dakuman13> yeah you could do a sub sundays
[2:38:11] <%QueequegTheater> YEYEYEYE
[2:38:15] <%king_wragles> LUL
[2:38:16] <DXLelouch24> why dont you try Killer? At worst youll kill all the women easy?
[2:38:19] <$Totally_not_toby> don't you say healslut
[2:38:20] <$SweetCheeksTrap> I WANNA PLAY
[2:38:21] <$Corporate_Redeemer> @galaxyswirl Yeah well, welcome to Dead By Daylight. Dumb decisions and extreme/unnecessary nerfs is kinda the name here in DBD. It's why Freddy got nerfed so hard.
[2:38:21] <$Totally_not_toby> just do not
[2:38:24] <coke_monster> LUL
[2:38:28] <%QueequegTheater> SAY IT LOUD
[2:38:29] <$Kataguro> No, just Best Perk
[2:38:41] <Dakuu75> who is big-beard-man, lol
[2:38:42] <$Corporate_Redeemer> Get Ash for his Mettle of Man
[2:38:50] <Prism_Wing> Now when you say "sub"... Kappa
[2:38:57] <nooblord_derpington> Elmo CoolCat
[2:39:07] <+VidyaFranX> Adrenaline is so much better
[2:39:10] <stabbityrabbit> You know, if they really wanted this to be a multi-player horror game wouldn't it make more sense to switch the perspective of the killer and the survivor? I.E. Survivors in first person, and killers in 3rd person. That seems scarier to me.
[2:39:16] <SpaceGuntank> what does "haste" do?
[2:39:17] <Prism_Wing> Shining Elmo
[2:39:33] <+skizzuto> seems like it's only good if you can survive into the endgame
[2:39:43] <BayowolfTerra> @stabbityrabbit it's a balance thing.
[2:39:57] <blackbeaking> Isn’t hope just budget adrenaline though?
[2:39:58] <$Corporate_Redeemer> Leader and Prove Thyself is for genrushing. It makes doing anything insanely fast.
[2:40:01] <%Gogogolem> @PeachSaliva That perk is aoe by the way.
[2:40:12] <BaronVonMagpie> I am consistently baffled but what I hear about this game
[2:40:33] <BaronVonMagpie> but thats cool, im just here to hang
[2:40:36] <Jayschroo> try Bond + Open Handed from Ace to make it better
[2:40:39] <%Gogogolem> @PeachSaliva Leader
[2:40:52] <Nina96> @PeachSaliva how does pat not get mind goblins from this game?
[2:41:04] <%QueequegTheater> @PeachSaliva You take a look at MK11? Do you like any of the new designs?
[2:41:18] <+windsoc> i like to see the big horror but am similarly confused by the actual mechanics
[2:41:22] <%QueequegTheater> >"Nea but toxic" LUL
[2:41:24] <dakuman13> I think the perks make the game super engaging and encounters scarier
[2:41:39] <$Corporate_Redeemer> It's not complicated. Unless you want to be a Nurse main though.
[2:41:45] <ArtThouBored> I'm telling you Paige, grow yourself a Stream Brain. It's a million dollar idea
[2:41:57] <Jayschroo> the game has a tutorial to ease in new players
[2:41:57] <blackbeaking> Dead by daylight is a perfect relaxation game
[2:41:58] <+windsoc> oh no its not you! its the perks that are the confusing part lol
[2:42:06] <+windsoc> i haven't played at all lol
[2:42:10] <BaronVonMagpie> I might try it at some point, my mindless game is warframe and its destroying my pinkie finger
[2:42:12] <$Corporate_Redeemer> IT'S A MORI
[2:42:18] <Jayschroo> MORI TIME ardethaWoke

[2:43:27] <%QueequegTheater> Paige is so good at this game
[2:43:33] <BayowolfTerra> you should get balanced landing, you'll like it

[2:43:47] <deviljhojho94> Brother tomatoCool
[2:43:58] <stabbityrabbit> @BayowolfTerra That doesn't really seem like a great defense to me. They could balance around a switched perspective. Not saying the game is bad or anything. It just seems like an odd choice.
[2:43:58] <dakuman13> @BaronVonMagpie Yo, what do you think of Warframe currently? I've been taking a break from it because I kinda don't have time to grind all day.
[2:44:05] <%QueequegTheater> LUL
[2:44:08] <a_mad_dragon> you mean chunneled? Kappa
[2:44:11] <deviljhojho94> OOF

[2:44:58] <Jayschroo> ardethaWoke
[2:45:05] <%mayorrev> @PeachSaliva does leatherface get less points for just chainsawing you or does he not have to worry about that
[2:45:11] <%QueequegTheater> It's like she's invisible
[2:45:11] <+VidyaFranX> Killers need either a rare item or certain perks to kill people like that
[2:45:13] <Pallion_> Killers should need to do more to be able to mori
[2:45:15] <$Kataguro> @deviljhojho94 You have to use a special item in your loadout to be able to kill people outright
[2:45:18] <CrimsonGargoyle> oh no is jane hanging out with tom cruise
[2:45:29] <$Kataguro> Leatherface gets a special burst of points for Chainsaw hits
[2:45:30] <+VidyaFranX> And killing people straight up gives you less points than hooking them
[2:45:31] <deviljhojho94> @Kataguro Ah that makes more sense
[2:45:35] <BayowolfTerra> yep
[2:45:37] <%QueequegTheater> @PeachSaliva Hey can you not read my most recent donation? It was a kneejerk reaction to caht

[2:54:28] <%QueequegTheater> WHO'S TALKING
[2:54:29] <Jayschroo> I hate legion so much
[2:54:32] <%mayorrev> I hear Legion gets a lot of hate, why's that?
[2:54:36] <%Gogogolem> Thumbtacks on the door
[2:54:40] <Ion_Laser> WHO SCREAMED THAT
[2:54:43] <$Kataguro> Is Legion still the low tier other than Freddie Tier?
[2:54:52] <%Gogogolem> legion is dead now.
[2:54:53] <SulfurousAcid> no locker dwighting
[2:54:58] <%Ell1ot> you can't hide in the coward closet?
[2:55:01] <%krawtch> ah, legion. the default killer with no power.
[2:55:05] <Crimsonaether96> who scream for da iced cream
[2:55:12] <Pallion_> lot of hate came from the infinite heal glitch
[2:55:13] <qo_op> 🦇🦇
[2:55:14] <%shockzndrawe> @PeachSaliva yo how do I get these signatures to you guys? Asked Pat but he never responded.
[2:55:17] <MarylandJutsu> Balls in the ASS
[2:55:24] <$Kataguro> Slow the game down just a little bit
[2:55:27] <dakuman13> legion is literally "IT WAS ME ALL ALONG"
[2:55:30] <%MaximumDaximum> The Thing?
[2:55:35] <mistersups> Ghostface
[2:55:38] <+mercado94> !uptime
[2:55:39] <hntronium> You thought it was Survivor BUT IT WAS I LEGION
[2:55:41] <%QueequegTheater> "Hey Freddy is garbage tier, how do we fix that?" "NERF HIM" "...Sure, why not"
[2:55:52] <tri3dgE027> Basically "The Thing" then, since he can transform to another Survivor?
[2:55:57] <NumbusPlays> I feel like Legion was *meant* to have a power that lets them disguise as a survivor but then they couldn't make that work for some reason.
[2:55:58] <%krawtch> legion used to be slow but had a power to make him faster
[2:55:58] <VJdarkworld> ditto from pokemon
[2:56:00] <%Gogogolem> @PeachSaliva He can ignore pallets and windows and survivors are babies.
[2:56:03] <Zamorouskiwhich> So because of the rank reset, i literally can't play because every killer I go up against in my rank has full builds and maxed perks. Yaaaaay~
[2:56:08] <dakuman13> I think legion is less scary and more annoying
[2:56:09] <%krawtch> now legion is faster but the power is worthless
[2:56:20] <%mayorrev> I dont get it cause the concept is awesome, mistaking a survivor for the killer sounds awesome
[2:56:21] <Crimsonaether96> henlo Pat Rick boi
[2:56:23] <%krawtch> survivors are absolutely bitches
[2:56:26] <%MegboyManuel> Pat Which killer you wanna be 4 fanart???
[2:56:27] <+mercado94> Is that Pat from Pat Stares At????!
[2:56:46] <zamzoph> ENTIRE TEAM IS BABIES BabyRage
[2:56:46] <Jayschroo> no it's because mending is super not fun
[2:56:52] <%ThePuddingDead> @PeachSaliva would u say this game is fun to play in the first 2 hours, in case I want my refund?
[2:57:04] <$Kataguro> I hope they rework Freddy soon
[2:57:07] <+VidyaFranX> Leatherface is wrose than Legion
[2:57:10] <+risenchudjr> Legion used to have a broken build where he would stab you, turn around, moonwalk backwards to cancel out his frenzy and hit you again
[2:57:11] <%QueequegTheater> Didn't Freddy get fucking nerfed
[2:57:15] <SirSmudgey> The bleed timer is infinite while you're in terror radius now in the new patch
[2:57:17] <deviljhojho94> freedy looks like shit
[2:57:22] <%MegboyManuel> Paaaaatt, which killer you be 4 fanart, augh
[2:57:25] <$Kataguro> She forgot about Maiden
[2:57:31] <%king_wragles> @PeachSaliva iron maiden
[2:57:32] <Valdorick> Paige, why would you do that when Iron Madian?
[2:57:34] <Nina96> paige no
[2:57:35] <%QueequegTheater> Freddy is by far the most interesting of the old slasher villains
[2:57:43] <NumbusPlays> LUL

[2:57:54] <SulfurousAcid> LUL
[2:58:07] <Jayschroo> YES
[2:58:22] <$RC_S3kshun8> real talk though, why the fuck would the character scream upon exiting a hiding spot? bullshit balance or is the character mental?
[2:58:41] <%Ell1ot> Plague is in this game?
[2:58:42] <$Kataguro> @RC_S3kshun8 The hiding spots have sharp things in them is the idea
[2:58:46] <%QueequegTheater> @RC_S3kshun8 The idea is Legion made the inside full of spikes
[2:58:48] <%krawtch> you can do it by missing any skill check i read. gen, heal, hook sabotage. anything.
[2:58:49] <Valdorick> There's a mind spike on the door... yeah yeah, let's go with that.
[2:58:59] <dakuman13> @RC_S3kshun8 it's because they're playing against legion who has closet bullshit
[2:59:03] <Dr_Trankenstein> exhaustion while in the dream world scorpioSmug
[2:59:08] <+risenchudjr> well, fucking a gen does keeo the game going a bit longer
[2:59:11] <%Gogogolem> @PeachSaliva It slows you actions.
[2:59:13] <$Kataguro> It makes your shit a little slower
[2:59:14] <%krawtch> you perform actions slower in the dream world i think
[2:59:23] <dakuman13> plague is really well done
[2:59:25] <+VidyaFranX> Freddy can see you in the Dream World and your actions progress slower
[2:59:30] <$RC_S3kshun8> @Kataguro @QueequegTheater @dakuman13 Thank you for explaining
[2:59:32] <%Gogogolem> @PeachSaliva By 10%
[2:59:33] <$Corporate_Redeemer> Legion gets a lot of hate because of how they can ignore basic game mechanics (like pallets and windows), he can get free hits on you by just sprinting after you and slowing down to hit you right after he hit you the first time which makes chases pointless. He also had two extremely broken bugged add-ons which were the Frank's Mixtape that cut down drastically on bleedout time and so Legions could either look at the ground or move backwards to run out the timer while still chasing you, which was
[2:59:41] <%ThePuddingDead> why not make it to where the survivors just start IN the dream world, and make freddy make traps with the environment like he does in the movies? @PeachSaliva
[2:59:43] <%MegboyManuel> Patrick, which killer you wanna be for 4 fanart :C ?
[2:59:56] <dakuman13> just make pat nurse
[2:59:57] <%mayorrev> RUN BILL

[3:01:00] <%wizkid50000> wizkid50000 subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 18 months, currently on a 18 month streak! 18 months is a long time! Been very stressed with work, but hope you two are okay! thanks for giving me something to look forward too!
[3:01:11] <%QueequegTheater> Which is why he sucks
[3:01:19] <Jayschroo> his dream world ACTIVELY hinders him
[3:01:22] <$Kataguro> Hex Ruin is really fucking this game up
[3:01:32] <$serpenttucker> What if freddy also had built in teleports, like to hooks when not holding a surivor?
[3:01:35] <Niney_Who> What if Dreamworld had Vaulting points get blocked after a single vault
[3:01:38] <dakuman13> could've just qualified it and made a dream stage for him who cares
[3:01:53] <Darkrenai> Yeah like just make the dream world an aesthetic thing and give him a teleport or something
[3:01:57] <$Kataguro> Jukes
[3:01:57] <Ion_Laser> YE YE YE
[3:01:57] <%galaxyswirl> @PeachSaliva make it so that if you are asleep you cant perform any actions until you wake back up
[3:01:57] <BayowolfTerra> Well I wanted to donate but streamlab says no.
[3:01:57] <MasterDecoder> WOW
[3:02:01] <Jayschroo> EZ JUKES
[3:02:03] <%krawtch> what if his gimmick was that putting you to sleep made you randomly fall asleep while crouched and need to perform a skill check to move again. failing the check results in you alerting him.
[3:02:03] <Ion_Laser> BiG JUKES
[3:02:06] <%MegboyManuel> JUKED
[3:02:10] <+miyoles> It would be cool if the dream world would teleport you to another map and you have to find a exit to get out into the main map
[3:02:10] <%mayorrev> 200 IQ
[3:02:11] <frozenwaifu> wot
[3:02:12] <dakuman13> oh
[3:02:13] <$Corporate_Redeemer> Legion's two Blade add-ons would increase the Mending time per hit. So he would only hit you with his ability to build up infinite stacks, let you heal, hit you again some more, and then you would have 30-minute Mending situations that would put the game on hold forever.
[3:02:15] <+korth367> MIND GAMES
[3:02:15] <$Kataguro> Less juke
[3:02:17] <%MegboyManuel> STALL TACTICS
[3:02:19] <$SleepyMaribo> GOTCHA!
[3:02:22] <%AncelDeLambert> LUL
[3:02:23] <%QueequegTheater> GoT Season 8 is proof that TLJ could have been SOOOOO much worse
[3:02:23] <worldbrand> wow
[3:02:24] <+DihyDroxy1> lol
[3:02:24] <$Kataguro> Smart Legion
[3:02:26] <Ion_Laser> Well...
[3:02:28] <%AncelDeLambert> got GOT
[3:02:29] <%MegboyManuel> Antijuked!
[3:02:31] <reonome> OUTPLAYED
[3:02:35] <%SaltyDongs> out moved
[3:02:35] <SGrim> He pulled a sneaky on ya woopsYes
[3:02:36] <Jayschroo> always gotta keep your camera on the killer
[3:02:36] <$RC_S3kshun8> What is Legion based on?
[3:02:38] <hntronium> bitch u thought you could outsmart the legion boi
[3:02:39] <BeeNoons> sfhHITORMISS
[3:02:39] <%MegboyManuel> He juked your juke
[3:02:44] <%mayorrev> I still enjoy the idea of a killer mimicking a survivor
[3:02:49] <%AncelDeLambert> @RC_S3kshun8 The Purge
[3:02:51] <dakuman13> got bazinga'd
[3:02:54] <$Kataguro> It's supposed to be coming this year...I hope
[3:02:56] <%mayorrev> i also enjoy his hoodie
[3:02:56] <Darkrenai> What other gimmick could you give freddy
[3:02:58] <$Corporate_Redeemer> 2 years actually
[3:03:02] <+Jacobblast> Leigon is based on the purge kids i think
[3:03:02] <%AncelDeLambert> basically he's literally just a bunch of asshole teenagers
[3:03:08] <$RC_S3kshun8> @AncelDeLambert Thanks brotato
[3:03:12] <%QueequegTheater> REWORK VAUBAN
[3:03:17] <+MonsieurHedge> warframe is 100000x worse
[3:03:20] <%AncelDeLambert> oh are they?
[3:03:21] <%galaxyswirl> league of legends is the same way
[3:03:25] <blackbeaking> Freddy’s rework is making new killers so people stop playing him
[3:03:25] <AllyBeeBoo> tomorrow?!
[3:03:26] <%mayorrev> buff ember UwU
[3:03:27] <dakuman13> warframe is so garbage, but i love it
[3:03:30] <$RC_S3kshun8> Did everyone see the Freddy vs Wolverine ERB?
[3:03:31] <%AncelDeLambert> iiiiiiinteresting
[3:03:34] <BayowolfTerra> Bare with me, I don't know what I'm doing
[3:03:41] <%krawtch> Warframe can fix its UI but apparently Skyrim still has a dogshit health bar 10 years later.
[3:03:43] <copyritetm> oh they wouldnt care
[3:03:48] <Ion_Laser> the exposure
[3:03:51] <worldbrand> DE's phrasing on the update was "hopefully this week" which means they don't even have a release candidate
[3:03:51] <Valdorick> "We gave you Freddy and you made him bitch tier."
[3:03:53] <%AncelDeLambert> "We gave you this character, and he's the worst one in the game, wtf?"
[3:03:54] <Sikelh> Too bad warframe destroyed it's controls
[3:03:54] <+MonsieurHedge> warframe literally doesnt have difficulty because you can oneshot entire levels with a single button. DBD is FINE in comparison
[3:03:56] <%mayorrev> F
[3:03:57] <reonome> F
[3:03:58] <mistersups> A bunch of killers are based off of icons that have been introduced later on. How do they differ? IE Hillbilly and Leatherface.
[3:03:59] <+VidyaFranX> Freddy's only garbage because they used the reboot Freddy and not OG Freddy
[3:04:03] <dakuman13> that would be hilarious if they did care
[3:04:04] <%QueequegTheater> @PeachSaliva Yes they are. Brand value gets decreased
[3:04:08] <%StencilOST> Gigantic pretty much died cus they focused on new champions rather than a reporting and DC system
[3:04:10] <%bevyrage> to be fair, bethesda is perfectly fine with their games being modded into acceptability
[3:04:16] <Nina96> but players will tell new people ge sucks and so on
[3:04:19] <$Kataguro> It's weird they used a Survivor from the remake too
[3:04:22] <Darkrenai> Worst tier is just Freddy Tier
[3:04:25] <OldOnyx> so roll tier
[3:04:26] <Nina96> he*
[3:04:32] <%QueequegTheater> @VidyaFranX Hey, the actor was great, it's just the movie he is in that sucked
[3:04:36] <+logoth_> the caustic of dbd
[3:04:37] <%krawtch> just running around as legion and never using frenzy is still better than freddy
[3:04:41] <All_Salt> How much and what brand is that couch desk?
[3:04:48] <xmetalicdemonx> the people that own freddy probably don't know what video games even are.
[3:04:51] <dakuman13> that's the WORST thing you could say about a character: that they're in their very own shit tier
[3:04:56] <%wizkid50000> NO YUO DONT
[3:05:00] <+its_x23> the devs are survivor mains
[3:05:02] <Darkrenai> Oh my god i just noticed paige is in the gamer cube
[3:05:03] <$Corporate_Redeemer> Legion had two gamebreaking exploits that made him horrible to play against. We're talking SERIOUSLY GAMEBREAKING
[3:05:03] <dakuman13> thats just sad
[3:05:03] <$Kataguro> Get that perk, girl
[3:05:03] <Darkrenai> YESSSS
[3:05:05] <$BayowolfTerra> cheer500 Hey Pat and Paige, thanks for getting me into Dead By Daylight, I love this game despite it's toxic community. Michael Myers is so damn fun and I'm looking forward to the next killer!
[3:05:06] <%king_wragles> @All_Salt it's a "couch master"
[3:05:14] <%Gogogolem> Just don't let people know they are in the dream state.
[3:05:21] <%QueequegTheater> Jackie Earle Haley was a great Freddy but the rest of the reboot sucked
[3:05:23] <$serpenttucker> OwO
[3:05:32] <$Kataguro> I like DBD streams
[3:05:32] <%shockzndrawe> Hey Pat Paige how are you guys tonight?

[3:06:13] <$thewhiterice92> I really like playing killer, but every time I chase a person I lean in as if that gets me closer
[3:06:20] <%shockzndrawe> Paige and her competetive DBD streams
[3:06:20] <juxtest> What if you replaced Freddie with a tank
[3:06:21] <+SolverCODO> legit sound effects there Paige
[3:06:21] <televisedrevolting> @nina96 Neither am I
[3:06:22] <Firesparks> pat, paige, you guys should play mordhau

[3:07:14] <%krawtch> paige flips the normie switch to hang with her RL friends
[3:07:15] <qo_op> i wonder if they have ideas for an alternate mode and if some character reworks would go better along with that

[3:10:04] <%MrSuperCasualBoom> @aflyingtaco1 Square Enix can’t do 18 player party’s. It’s only 4-8 member cast that look like J pop Fantasy games

[3:12:29] <Valdorick> Hue hue hue
[3:12:31] <%shockzndrawe> Paige's stand is that she tends to stockpile her luck into one massive huge lucky instance, but at the cost of her suffering at minimal and trival things
[3:12:32] <%krawtch> she ran at him like she was the one with the chainsaw and hammer.

[3:14:53] <%MrSuperCasualBoom> cheer200 The PaigeStation 5 is fully backward compatible back to the PaigeStation 2 cause 2 means it’s her fault. But rather play the PaigeStation than Pat’s Gamecube. However, both would be overthrown by the NeoGeoElmo Pocket Color.

[3:25:17] <seycheles> paige did nothing wrong
[3:25:18] <+windsoc> best robin hood musical was the cameo in shrek
[3:25:21] <+miyoles> a old funny movie
[3:25:23] <$Corporate_Redeemer> Pat, Paige is rambling again
[3:25:23] <$RC_S3kshun8> FROM NOW ON. ALL TOILETS IN THE LAND.
[3:25:24] <Zaphire_Saucypants> ah yes...Dave Chapelle
[3:25:24] <%Kirby_Sauce> Saints Row Gat out of Hell was my favorite musical

[3:25:46] <MarylandJutsu> 20th CENTURY FOX
[3:25:48] <Ion_Laser> Shit Bawls
[3:25:49] <rosemon5001> the true question is does paige has an medival chastity belt under combo
[3:25:49] <eldragon_1> I love that movie
[3:25:54] <+SWFanatic> i love the braile playboy in that movie
[3:25:56] <+RushUnplugged> literally the best Robin Hood movie
[3:26:00] <dakuman13> naw but nurse tho
[3:26:01] <%MegboyManuel> got it Billy
[3:26:03] <%QueequegTheater> Billy is way too tall Pat
[3:26:04] <Valdorick> Pat Billy makes sense
[3:26:09] <%MegboyManuel> Big dumb eye on your face
[3:26:12] <%shockzndrawe> Whats got billy so spooked
[3:26:13] <DedlokPM> @PeachSaliva But you would make a perfect The Clown
[3:26:20] <%MegboyManuel> Ill make a short Billy
[3:26:26] <Valdorick> Its fan art, Billy Pat can be as short as it needs to be, maybe even shorter! IF such a thing a thing is possible!
[3:26:34] <%krawtch> give Pat a face like someone spilled scrambled eggs on the stove
[3:26:36] <dakuman13> @MegboyManuel bonus for nurse tho
[3:26:37] <%QueequegTheater> Pat needs to be a nurse
[3:26:44] <%MegboyManuel> Chibi Pat Billy
[3:26:44] <%shockzndrawe> I still need to so some of the stupid fan art I was supposed to
[3:26:56] <%QueequegTheater> There are a lot of ways we can interpret that, pat
[3:26:57] <%MegboyManuel> Holy shit riding the chainsaw is a great idea
[3:27:00] <ScreamingMeat> Like a unicycle
[3:27:07] <+mercado94> i wish i had the money for a tablet
[3:27:08] <%shockzndrawe> like MODOK pat in his gamer cube
[3:27:11] <$SiameseSneeze> I can't get over this gamer cube
[3:27:11] <$Kataguro> Big Coward
[3:27:15] <televisedrevolting> Like a rocket?
[3:27:25] <%MrSuperCasualBoom> I was gonna super impose Pat face on Jim Carrey face saying “I just want to see one of your titties, girl”
[3:27:32] <$BayowolfTerra> oh you're right.
[3:27:33] <dakuman13> just draw him in his gamer cube holding the chainsaw
[3:27:36] <blackbeaking> When is this game gonna get a Baba Yaga killer? That would be so cool
[3:27:51] <$BayowolfTerra> one shot killers always are
[3:28:01] <%Kirby_Sauce> Christopher Walken has some lungs on him
[3:28:30] <+VidyaFranX> GhostFace still has the phone though
[3:28:44] <mistersups> He's kinda like Legion when you think about it
[3:28:44] <+VidyaFranX> It's probably the best Mori in the game
[3:28:45] <Valdorick> Knife, Phone, and having terrible teen comedies made after him.
[3:28:47] <%Gogogolem> @PeachSaliva Make it so fast its hard to control
[3:28:56] <$Kataguro> Hooks become cocoons and the Entity chestbursts you
[3:28:57] <kerotuyu> I think Silent Hill monsters would work
[3:28:58] <hntronium> Xenomorph would ignore pallets
[3:29:01] <dakuman13> didnt kirby explain how the xenomorph could work
[3:29:06] <DXLelouch24> how about Predator Pat would he work?
[3:29:26] <$BayowolfTerra> yeah, he's just a dude
[3:29:27] <+tigerfang86> LMAO
[3:29:27] <+mercado94> no paige. This is serious we are talking about a movie monster in a videogame
[3:29:31] <KitsuneSidhe> Make the Xenomorph have to start as a facehugger
[3:29:34] <+tigerfang86> most of these people are just people sized
[3:29:37] <Dakuu75> random question: does playing game son borderless window, cause your pc to work harder than full screen?
[3:29:40] <+tigerfang86> it's HUGE
[3:29:42] <DracaenaLeaf> fire
[3:29:43] <$Piemono> Just have the pallet get set on fire
[3:29:44] <$BayowolfTerra> Michael Myers or Freddy? no, probably not.
[3:29:47] <LtThunderbolt> yall are funny
[3:29:49] <%shockzndrawe> Paige should play Alien Isolation
[3:29:50] <+tigerfang86> WHAT
[3:29:52] <+tigerfang86> HUH
[3:29:53] <MrGreenToS> The xeno own blood would melt the pallet
[3:29:54] <dakuman13> do flamethrowers count
[3:29:54] <%krawtch> 2
[3:29:57] <%AncelDeLambert> the xenomorph in the original Alien used subterfuge to kill, it wasn't that strong
[3:30:02] <DracaenaLeaf> flamethrowers count
[3:30:10] <+tigerfang86> THE MUSICAL
[3:30:11] <%krawtch> TWOOOO
[3:30:13] <+SWFanatic> 2
[3:30:13] <+mercado94> wat
[3:30:14] <otkbrybry> elephants are top tier though
[3:30:15] <ScreamingMeat> There's a muscial?
[3:30:16] <hntronium> paige?
[3:30:16] <Lord_of_all_Edges> musical... aliens?
[3:30:18] <+RushUnplugged> if they put in a xenomorph might as well throw away any pretense of realism and put Pinhead in it
[3:30:18] <+tigerfang86> 2
[3:30:18] <DXLelouch24> what?
[3:30:19] <roflwaffleauthoritah> 2
[3:30:19] <mistersups> Did you see the Highschool play
[3:30:20] <emillionghost> LUL
[3:30:20] <frozenwaifu> IF YOU THREW A PALETTE AT A FUCKIN ELEPHANT
[3:30:21] <Valdorick> Pat, its a magic eldritch location wooden pallet, its magic and eldritch, it can stun an Alien.
[3:30:22] <DXLelouch24> TWO
[3:30:23] <CaramelTaffy> aliens
[3:30:23] <person181> paige is just trying to make her words true
[3:30:23] <dakuman13> that's some 2 ass shit right thur
[3:30:23] <%QueequegTheater> Scout Trooper MkVenner from Gaunt's Ghosts is a Welsh, quarterstaff-wielding, kung-fu Navy Seal ninja. WH40K is so dumb I love it
[3:30:25] <joneworldbeater> You mean that thing where elephants are legit shook by mice?
[3:30:25] <DXLelouch24> BIG 2
[3:30:25] <televisedrevolting> Pyramid Head would be cool as hell. Could have James Sutherland or however you spell his last name as the survivor.
[3:30:25] <CrypticMochi> 2
[3:30:28] <Rngiddion> the yellow?
[3:30:31] <$Kataguro> She's looping to buy you time, girl
[3:30:31] <+TheShal> Why would you ruin a great movie like Alien by making it a musical?
[3:30:32] <bloodypurpledog> But what if the pallet shoots a flamethrower
[3:30:33] <%reandgaf> reandgaf subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 21 months, currently on a 21 month streak! Popped in here to say hello and to say WOWIE 21 months I mainly watch the VODs but I'm going to sleep watching this. Love you 3 pet Elmo and night
[3:30:35] <+tigerfang86> big 2
[3:30:35] <%AncelDeLambert> Looping at work, folks, the most annoying thing possible
[3:30:36] <%Kirby_Sauce> Monsters can totes be stunned, I thought you played MHW? Pat's a fake gamer girl everyone!
[3:30:37] <juxtest> The Yellow
[3:30:37] <%MrSuperCasualBoom> Alien the Musical sounds hilarious
[3:30:38] <a_mad_dragon> "Alien is a movie where nobody listens to the smart lady, and everybody dies except for the smart lady and her cat."
[3:30:40] <%Gogogolem> @PeachSaliva Theres a scene in aliens where someone hits an Alien with a hammer and they get sprayed with acid from the head wound they made then the xenomorph tears them apart.
[3:30:40] <+Blargimazombie> Loader = yellow?
[3:30:40] <%starotter70> Gotta get the power to the purple dude
[3:30:41] <%AncelDeLambert> @PeachSaliva that pig was getting LOOPED
[3:30:59] <$BayowolfTerra> Freddy's definitely the most questionable in this game, what with the whole dream demon thing.
[3:31:01] <+RushUnplugged> put ROBOCOP in the game, you cowards!
[3:31:02] <joneworldbeater> @a_mad_dragon that's correct
[3:31:04] <ShipmanSinkingShip> asylum1Beard asylum1Beard asylum1Beard asylum1Beard
[3:31:04] <$Kataguro> Find a gen and do it

[3:31:06] <%Kirby_Sauce> How about the scorpion king?
[3:31:07] <DXLelouch24> would Chuckie work or is he too small?
[3:31:10] <+tigerfang86> BIG all paige
[3:31:20] <blackbeaking> Chuckle would be great
[3:31:22] <%krawtch> get away from her you BITCH, but bitch is sung
[3:31:24] <bloodypurpledog> They should add Alvin and the Chipmunks
[3:31:27] <+LethalLanderr> Hey everyone hop on dead by daylight on ps4 we’re trynna play
[3:31:28] <%MegboyManuel> Terminator was originally horror
[3:31:28] <%shockzndrawe> put skellmo in the game
[3:31:35] <%MegboyManuel> Terminator 1 killer pls
[3:31:35] <%QueequegTheater> Reminder that Mkoll took out a chaos dreadnought singlehandedly, in a minefield, without anti-armor weapons
[3:31:36] <%MrSuperCasualBoom> Candyman should be in it
[3:31:41] <Cobaltor_252> oh my god Paige is in the cube
[3:31:44] <dakuman13> xenomorph would look stupid in this environment anyway
[3:31:45] <%QueequegTheater> WHERE'S MY GAUNTS GHOSTS GAME

[3:31:46] <+RushUnplugged> T1 is literally a slasher film
[3:31:53] <$BayowolfTerra> i doubt will get Chuckie, killer sizes are important for balance.
[3:31:56] <Valdorick> Put Lu Bu in the game as a killer, make him always know the location of someone if they're following him Kappa
[3:31:56] <nooblord_derpington> I think Chuckie could work if he could put down dublicate toys
[3:31:57] <Zamorouskiwhich> Alien 2: The Musical sounds like a Family Guy sketch >_>
[3:32:01] <%krawtch> hold sprint to dash out of a locker
[3:32:07] <DXLelouch24> shes trollin
[3:32:07] <%AncelDeLambert> ????
[3:32:10] <%MegboyManuel> Imagine naked killer Arnold, that'd be dope shit
[3:32:11] <blackbeaking> Chuckle would be the same size as a crouching pig though

[3:53:45] <%audrus> @PeachSaliva you can grow your own tobacco
[3:53:48] <%rumtumtugnutz> I smoke pot several times a day so I don't judge.
[3:53:48] <%QueequegTheater> Weed is actively much less dangerous
[3:53:51] <leinadtonu> It's worse if you don't do it daily...
[3:53:52] <frozenwaifu> i eat weed
[3:53:54] <Valdorick> Is it Cuban?
[3:53:59] <+Nomicro4u> Eat a whole Marijuana
[3:54:00] <%MrSuperCasualBoom> You sure you that was a cigar?
[3:54:04] <$rdark_ksu> weed makes brownies
[3:54:05] <+ChillyEctomorph> Weed makes you anxious.
[3:54:06] <a_mad_dragon> enjoy your ORAL CANCER

[4:05:41] <%Kirby_Sauce> cheer500 paige, you say you like starfox, but have you played adventures or assault? Those were my favorites. The multiplayer in assault was rad. Me and my brothers would recreate those fights where you fire from an arwing's wing while someone else flies. Shit was the best.
