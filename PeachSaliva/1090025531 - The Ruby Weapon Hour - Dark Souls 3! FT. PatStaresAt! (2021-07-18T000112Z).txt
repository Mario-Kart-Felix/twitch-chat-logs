[1:17:43] <rekinom> I don't think Paige even knows where she is right now
[1:17:43] <%KeiganOfAstora> It's still gross to eat just ham but you're not destroying a sandwich
[1:17:43] <freelancebabymaker> oh god thats so true
[1:17:44] <+SenorCounter> Cause he's not panicky
[1:17:44] <@Jekado> because she over thinks
[1:17:45] <%Ranryu692> ADHD works in mysterious ways
[1:17:46] <+coward_man> it's cause she's not overthinking it
[1:17:46] <+Ultimate_Edge> Because she stresses easily
[1:17:46] <therealtacopancakes> ye, keep talking about ham
[1:17:47] <%SilvaChariot0133> Fueled by spite maybe?
[1:17:48] <+badchoice5> because she never learned, and her instincts are better than her brain
[1:17:49] <$Bizarre_Devil> Yeah it's wild
[1:17:49] <MileenaTheOni> Neanderthal? More like Ne-ham-derthal.
[1:17:50] <bleugh> nyannUguu
[1:17:51] <Hydrapissed> SHES DED
[1:17:51] <+Jonny_Worldbeater> NOT THE SAME AT ALL
[1:17:51] <bevyrage> that's been the case every stream where she performs better the less she pays attention to the game
[1:17:51] <$AzureGale> You just broke her concentration, Pat
[1:17:52] <Laecerelius> Her brain betrays her!
[1:17:53] <digaogrunge> ENGAGE HER PAT
[1:17:54] <scrumbotime> pat, keep paige from thinking so no brain paige can do it
[1:17:56] <djblue_shift> oh boy

[1:18:09] <%ShockzNDrawe> it hurts to think
[1:18:10] <Prevot> ruh roh
[1:18:11] <porkued> going to a butcher and getting ham is different than going to a sandwich shop and taking the ham out of the sandwich they gave you
[1:18:12] <+Mechanized82> its a party we all love it here, nice drinks, food, etc
[1:18:13] <reasonance> oh no she got the woolies

[1:18:28] <Skatedeandre> Herman Miller
[1:18:28] <+RealThiele> those huge honkers need support
[1:18:28] <BoxNavy> monkaS
[1:18:29] <$AzureGale> NEEDLE'D
[1:18:29] <Hydrapissed> shes dying LIVE
[1:18:32] <%ShockzNDrawe> it's your ears
[1:18:34] <%Birdigalore> Paige has tapped into Ultra Instint. You need to think less, and feel more
[1:18:39] <happy_void> that sounds frightening
[1:18:42] <+fetrigon> no johns
[1:18:46] <Profmcstevie> When the ham stops the skills stop, clearly she needs meat based motivation
[1:18:50] <Skatedeandre> She’s dying live on stream
[1:18:53] <digaogrunge> the game is breaking her
[1:18:54] <+JenovasPuppet> LUL
[1:18:56] <Laecerelius> It's the guy vomming ghosts
[1:18:58] <faintsmile> very upset
[1:18:59] <BigFingerRo> wait, did one of the enemies despawn?
[1:19:00] <+Mechanized82> use the secret arts of the old ways to defeat them
[1:19:02] <bevyrage> paige is likely to collect the entire armor set before she clears the first quarter of this zone
[1:19:05] <BigFingerRo> Oh, there he is
[1:19:05] <%nichos7> Those dudes drink a potion or something to spit out those skulls
[1:19:07] <Laecerelius> like they've been vomming ghosts this entire time
[1:19:10] <dinnydanny777> Why IS everybody in Dark Souls so mad
[1:19:11] <+Lunarhawk> damn he baited you
[1:19:21] <Maids4lyfe> they don't want to be skeletons Paige
[1:19:22] <+Jonny_Worldbeater> The gooey noise is Paige's brain dissolving into gamer goo
[1:19:23] <Zerenis> Cause being a skeleton sucks
[1:19:25] <+necrocannibal2> everyone in Dark Souls is a hateful ghost
[1:19:26] <%Estuko> Love the vtuber model Paige! Super super cute
[1:19:27] <bevyrage> psaBlind

[1:19:45] <%KeiganOfAstora> She started in 2020, not 2019
[1:19:46] <Samurai_Jake> It’s gonna be interesting seeing the new vtuber fans filter into this cesspool stream. It’ll be great
[1:19:46] <bevyrage> farewell item
[1:19:47] <BigFingerRo> HOW DID THAT NOT HIT
[1:19:48] <djblue_shift> how did that miss

[1:20:21] <+Etherealizer> that noise was it reaching down its throat to pull out the Gnaw miracle
[1:20:21] <peachy996> The fall of Human Civilization is which fall she meant
[1:20:26] <MileenaTheOni> The fox can have a little respect, as a treat.
[1:20:30] <Maids4lyfe> lol
[1:20:34] <+realm_forge> Fire is still hot Paige
[1:20:37] <+SiameseDuck> Paige's constant look of surprise is great

[1:22:39] <%Lion_kun> STAMINA MANAGEMENT
[1:22:40] <%Ranryu692> Paige started the fight by dodging when they were still turning around to look at her
[1:22:40] <+tempestzephyr> she only know unga
[1:22:41] <+QueequegTheater> and then instead of running away she kept swinging a third time

[1:22:49] <+TechnicolorNinja> doodLUL
[1:22:52] <%nichos7> You must bunga
[1:22:53] <NireFuster> Pat you need to keep her occupied and talk to her so she plays good
[1:22:53] <bevyrage> i've got you on the tv and i can hear your button crunching
[1:22:56] <+QueequegTheater> Sulyvahn andys malding
[1:22:56] <Jetsfantasy> Pat, what if you swapped her dodge and swing buttons? She'd be invincible
[1:22:58] <+saiko2208> Pat talk about ham again
[1:22:59] <Mr_JustinJones> Sounds like a Honda player
[1:23:00] <+SenorCounter> Give her more Salami. Salami soothes her.
[1:23:00] <postmortempc> Paige is a vtuber now? Is this to hide the pregnancy
[1:23:01] <faintsmile> its the constant panic fucking her up LUL
[1:23:01] <bevyrage> it's almost as loud as pat

[1:23:09] <+Lunarhawk> @PeachSaliva If this area is too stressful we can go back to the hell cave demon
[1:23:10] <peachy996> Give her a baby weapon to force her to relax
[1:23:13] <+realm_forge> PAIGE SMASH! PAIGE DESTROY PUNY ARMOR MEN
[1:23:15] <+SiameseDuck> :0
[1:23:20] <Gorshum> You got this!
[1:23:21] <+RealThiele> hot gameplay
[1:23:22] <Spudnacious_Dynasty> Her going left around the fountain is like Reggie taking the same stairs in Demon's Souls every time
[1:23:22] <%ThomasOfTroy> This IS the most viewed DS3 stream on twitch right now
[1:23:23] <boomstickery> most of us have seen her do much worse
[1:23:24] <Hydrapissed> souls down
[1:23:25] <+badchoice5> Well hey, she beat some of the mobs, that is something
[1:23:26] <@PlagueOfGripes> my advice is to slow down and stop listening to Pat
[1:23:26] <%misteroutdated> More than 5
[1:23:27] <+AbnormalVoid> LUL
[1:23:27] <notsoy> LOLLLLLLL
[1:23:27] <vinceshamwowslap> vtubler
[1:23:29] <Laecerelius> Yeah those guys like to just keep swinging
[1:23:30] <blackbaron98> REKD
[1:23:32] <%Lion_kun> that third swing
[1:23:32] <Hydrapissed> ZERO prog SO FAR
[1:23:39] <Monkeyweed21> Paige needs to panic up, not calm down
[1:23:40] <tomdwarf> I mean, Paige got a shield. She COULD use it.
[1:23:44] <faintsmile> go back to arguing abt ham, that seemed to work
[1:23:44] <Phob05> To be fair this area sucks
[1:23:46] <%nichos7> She could
[1:23:46] <CanadianAnimatorGuy> Paige should play Cuphead
[1:23:48] <%nichos7> But she won't
[1:23:50] <+RealThiele> yea angry paige was spite winning
[1:23:52] <%doomunderthestairs> how long has she been at it game play wise?
[1:23:57] <Quilltaz> What if we gave peach this big salami to carry in her mouth like nezuko, would she get a powerup ingame with her ultra instinct?
[1:23:57] <%KeiganOfAstora> @PeachSaliva You have more options such as blocking with L1 or using weapon arts with L2
[1:23:57] <%tsubakiparadox> seeing Paige is kinda why I hate big and slow builds lol. I prefer coward dodge and stab
[1:24:00] <+badchoice5> Paige is too honorable to avoid enemy attacks
[1:24:01] <+Lunarhawk> Like an hour
[1:24:02] <%ospreyworks> big blind
[1:24:04] <bleugh> try rolling thats a good trick?
[1:24:06] <+QueequegTheater> I'm really happy the whole "wholesome" vtuber persona thing from the first stream was just immediately discarded
[1:24:06] <RedChrisfield> nah the shield is Aesthetically pleasing only
[1:24:07] <Monkeyweed21> @Hydrapissed she made 1 progress from the bridge to here
[1:24:08] <+Ultimate_Edge> She needs that Monster Hunter food buff
[1:24:09] <+RandyFistburgers> give her the ham pat
[1:24:12] <+IDTheftVictim> Problem with v-tuber model is now we can't see pat judging in the background

[1:29:25] <+MooseIsGoose> Can you get a trash can that has the top flap up and down for when pat talks
[1:29:25] <+TechnicolorNinja> doodMash
[1:29:26] <tomdwarf> Yes. Very distracting.

[1:29:29] <Gorshum> LUL
[1:29:30] <Kobi_Robi_Tobi> That's where all the poise is
[1:29:30] <$SkeletAlpha> THE BOOBS ARE BLOCKING THE SOUL COUNTER, UBSUBSCRIBE
[1:29:31] <CptHarlok> Nice
[1:29:31] <Prevot> THAT'S why you feel so heavy
[1:29:31] <@commanderclaw> "I'm just too hot to be good at videogames"

[1:29:36] <+IDTheftVictim> The breasts are crushing the lungs, wasting precious stamina
[1:29:37] <+badchoice5> The V-tuber's breasts made the child uncomfortable
[1:29:38] <cyb3r_demon> the anime tiddy too strong
[1:29:40] <%GabeSweetMan> To whoever with an issue with big tiddo, follow Paige's lead and squint REALLY HARD so you can't see them anymore.
[1:29:40] <afronooch> :( if only no boobs, she'd be better at bideo game
[1:29:41] <MetroidSlayerP7> woah woah woah. Paige is a fox now?! since when?!
[1:29:41] <$AzureGale> I gotta come straight
[1:29:41] <faintsmile> i cant believe it theyre TOO HUGE
[1:29:42] <CanadianAnimatorGuy> Continue the thought lol
[1:29:42] <Tedd_Zero> Brains are clearly stored in the boobs guys, c'mon.
[1:29:44] <freelancebabymaker> the tits would like to play too paige
[1:29:45] <theloganbrand> just crop the tits out
[1:29:45] <DracaenaLeaf> your boobs are in the way of the souls :^(((
[1:29:46] <+probably_facetious> You can't win fights if you don't attack, so why do anything else?
[1:29:47] <+SiameseDuck> She doesn't want to press the button but her enormous boobs press the button for her
[1:29:47] <+FoolsArcade> WAIT, I got the Boob DM too
[1:29:47] <%maenos2> also like what did complainer idiot even expect to happen
[1:29:50] <%KeiganOfAstora> @PeachSaliva Try running past everything until you find a bonfire
[1:29:50] <SivShele> close your eyes and picture... even bigger boobs
[1:29:50] <leinadtonu> chewing air, swinging at the air... those boobs sure get in the way
[1:29:52] <$Draylle> maybe an incel
[1:29:52] <%Ranryu692> what if they're your mom's breasts?
[1:29:53] <TysonSirius> Animated tiddy bad
[1:29:53] <shieldecho> I mean...dysphoria...
[1:29:54] <$SkeletAlpha> rofl
[1:29:54] <Coystick> I'm angry about boobs
[1:29:54] <theshillman> my breasts ruin my day
[1:29:54] <$KnivesEve> Tell the boobs to stop
[1:29:55] <Hydrapissed> hes got some huge incel rage
[1:29:56] <@PlagueOfGripes> I can't hear you over the tits
[1:29:57] <lemonade21icecold> peach vtuber hahahaaaaaa
[1:29:58] <Hydrapissed> to be mad at breast
[1:29:59] <Prevot> hey one dude, just cover the bottom right of the screen with a post-it note
[1:30:00] <TheYellowcouch> YEAH PAT IMAGINE SOMEONE'S BREAST RUINING SOMEONES DAY
[1:30:01] <%samTUMZfestival> They only ever made my day better in the past.
[1:30:01] <%Estuko> They probably don't go outside at all
[1:30:02] <MileenaTheOni> Do you guys think the boobs could play better?
[1:30:02] <Spudnacious_Dynasty> Maybe some fucked up plastic surgery
[1:30:03] <swansong118> I mean my breasts ruin my day but thats cause im a man
[1:30:03] <SGrim> @PeachSaliva getting in the way of what? Is that why you can't dodge properly? Are they in the way of your view of the circle button?
[1:30:04] <+RealThiele> never, breasts can only enchance my day, hitting me with tits included
[1:30:05] <peachy996> It's possible for Breasts to ruin someone's day
[1:30:05] <cyb3r_demon> said noone ever
[1:30:05] <%AncelDeLambert> everyone put your hands up and give Paige your energy
[1:30:05] <digaogrunge> EVEN THEN
[1:30:07] <boomstickery> being hit by a girls huge tits is a baed thing~?
[1:30:07] <Jetsfantasy> There was a V-tuber who got in trouble on the premier for having huge titties iirc LUL
[1:30:07] <TheYellowcouch> WHAT A CRAZY THING
[1:30:07] <%ElkRiverDog> So does this require a ban hammer or the hentai paddle?
[1:30:10] <afronooch> going outside would probably help them tbh
[1:30:11] <+chase959> what if knockers knocked out his teeth and now they leave a sour taste
[1:30:13] <+badchoice5> OH GOD THE TITTIES ARE HERE!?!?
[1:30:15] <NireFuster> Imagine a world where you're walking around the street and your day is RUINED by a woman's big gigantic tits
[1:30:17] <+3d_pbandj> The boobs are upsetting the child!
[1:30:18] <+Lunarhawk> paige your breasts are not anime big in flesh form i think he'll only be like mildly bothered by them
[1:30:19] <%KeiganOfAstora> Dude who's DMing about breasts: Just go somewhere else man....
[1:30:20] <peachy996> What if they're saggy granny breasts
[1:30:21] <+Ne1son> Listen Booba are very dangerous Paige. Waving around like bags of san and whatnot
[1:30:23] <MarylandJutsu> tits killed m family
[1:30:23] <CanadianAnimatorGuy> They were upset that it wasn't "Accurate"
[1:30:23] <%geekjacob> imagine having such small pp energy
[1:30:25] <postmortempc> Knew a dude who was on set of about Schmidt as a kid…. Tities ruined his day then
[1:30:26] <$AzureGale> And if you close your eyes, does it feel like nothing's changed at all?
[1:30:27] <%AncelDeLambert> \o/ praise the sun
[1:30:28] <Dementedpenguin> LUL
[1:30:31] <%doomunderthestairs> now it all makes sense
[1:30:31] <balthazar758> tits tactics
[1:30:31] <+RealThiele> one guy: "oh tits why"
[1:30:32] <+realm_forge> ….Paige needs to play RE8 ASAP
[1:30:32] <cyb3r_demon> that must be it
[1:30:32] <%GabeSweetMan> LUL
[1:30:34] <%maenos2> hell boobs make my day BETTER
[1:30:35] <$SkeletAlpha> They are blockign the soul counter lol
[1:30:36] <%tsubakiparadox> Best part is, he can totally change and learn from this massive fuck up. but probably won't Kappa
[1:30:36] <mike2hands> LUL LUL LUL LUL
[1:30:38] <%nichos7> Ah, it all makes sense now
[1:30:39] <Tedd_Zero> quiettHA
[1:30:39] <Quilltaz> Paige is trying to sneak around castle superbeast but her anime breasts clapping together keeps alerting all the followers of woolie and their swampy ways
[1:30:39] <%ShockzNDrawe> Everytime she says tits, her chest grows in size
[1:30:40] <leinadtonu> boobs cover the stamina bar
[1:30:40] <cyb3r_demon> we solved the mystery guys good work
[1:30:41] <theloganbrand> She mistook her right tit for the circle button
[1:30:42] <mike2hands> tit nerfs
[1:30:44] <Coystick> Underperforming underhanf
[1:30:44] <Laecerelius> Paige needs smaller boobs to play better, it's just science
[1:30:50] <mike2hands> Tits debuffs
[1:30:52] <%doomunderthestairs> go big hammer go
[1:30:54] <Kristoffers> "I got a breast reduction to beat dark souls 3"
[1:30:55] <ArtyMcDaniels> I missed the start, did they go over the masterpiece Space Jam 2?
[1:30:55] <$Bizarre_Devil> Is the problem her tibby or no glasses?
[1:30:56] <+RealThiele> dual analog LUL
[1:30:58] <+badchoice5> perhaps if the boobs were even larger they could play the game for her?
[1:31:01] <SGrim> This just in, breast reduction is a performance enhancing surgery for female gamers!
[1:31:01] <Monkeyweed21> underperforming booba
[1:31:01] <%vVAstrAVv> her boobs keep hitting r1 too lol
[1:31:02] <NireFuster> Paige's boobs are weighing her character down
[1:31:02] <MileenaTheOni> Paige has increased booba, but lost aerodynamics.
[1:31:05] <$SkeletAlpha> Good weapon choice for here too
[1:31:05] <danteftw20> the only way titties ruin my day is if they're sad stripper boobs, like dimes in a gymsock sad
[1:31:07] <rusho> Would they even be entertained if you performed perfectly though?
[1:31:09] <scht3v3> To be fair, you gotta be big and strong to have big booba
[1:31:10] <TheYellowcouch> maybe if her boobs got bigger they might accidentally hit the dodge button when she needs it
[1:31:10] <leinadtonu> Just get smaller boobs like that tennis player.
[1:31:11] <%hewlettfan96> Her tits need a reduction so it’s more feasible
[1:31:13] <+MooseIsGoose> Smaller boobs make you more arrow dynamic so you play better
[1:31:13] <%AncelDeLambert> what's the weapon art on the Vordt hammer?
[1:31:15] <rosemon5001> soo has anyone checked rule34 if someone allready made lewd art of her vtuber avatar?
[1:31:18] <BigYanno> I went to take a shower, are we talking about how Paige's avatar's boobs have stolen her brainmass
[1:31:20] <+Jonny_Worldbeater> Booba too big, keeping blood from flowing to brain.
[1:31:21] <rekinom> Oh, these? My boobies? My massive fucking titties? My super stuffed milkies? My honker bonker doinky boinkies? My fucking fabric stretching wind flapping gravity welling sex mounds? You mean these super duper ultra hyper god damn motherfucking tits?
[1:31:22] <Hydrapissed> shes already lost her souls many a time
[1:31:26] <Kobi_Robi_Tobi> Just were spiked armour and let the boots shank fools for you
[1:31:27] <Laecerelius> Yeah just gotta get up in those guts
[1:31:28] <+realm_forge> What if Paige put down the mace and hit the enemies with her boobs instead
[1:31:32] <+RealThiele> get in that pussy
[1:31:32] <MileenaTheOni> The weapon art on the Vordt hammer is Stance, as memory serves.
[1:31:34] <%doomunderthestairs> so when are we getting the toiletvtuber for pat?
[1:31:35] <thisisfine_94> They add too much weight to roll!
[1:31:35] <%GabeSweetMan> If Pat ever gets that toilet avatar made, it should have big porcelain man-tiddos.
[1:31:37] <orpleborple> the zoners of dark souls three
[1:31:38] <%maenos2> @rosemon5001 artist posted the design to a certain site. I heard, I mean.
[1:31:39] <+AbnormalVoid> like clockwork
[1:31:40] <%nichos7> Excellent model-touching
[1:31:41] <djblue_shift> I MUST SWING
[1:31:45] <+sourbubblz> literal backpedalling
[1:31:46] <SGrim> @rekinom "sex mounds?"
[1:31:47] <MarylandJutsu> So the definiton of madness pat
[1:31:47] <NireFuster> Why did she try to swing and not dodge
[1:31:49] <Phob05> Paige where you mashing the attack button there?
[1:31:50] <Monkeyweed21> EVERY TIME
[1:31:51] <%samTUMZfestival> I lucked out in High School when I dated my crush with big boobs.
[1:31:51] <BigFingerRo> HEE HEE HEEE HEE
[1:31:52] <mike2hands> you can do it peach
[1:31:57] <swansong118> Dont listen paige, just keep swinging!
[1:31:59] <rosemon5001> @maenos2 you mean scientists
[1:31:59] <djblue_shift> there is no dodge
[1:32:00] <%samTUMZfestival> Totally peaked
[1:32:02] <yuggie_the_shark> you could sprint past all of them to the next bonfire
[1:32:03] <djblue_shift> only swing
[1:32:03] <MileenaTheOni> 'I Have No Dodge, But I Must Swing'
[1:32:05] <%Lion_kun> Why run up to them

[1:32:09] <+RealThiele> keep going pat it only makes her more skilled
[1:32:11] <+badchoice5> Are the boobs eclipsing the sun, causing sundowning?
[1:32:12] <+SiameseDuck> I don't want to be rude though but your breasts are getting in the way of me enjoying dark souls
[1:32:14] <%Lion_kun> or get them when their back is to you
[1:32:16] <faintsmile> do it for the boobs paige
[1:32:17] <+BlueHolli> all this Unga bunga
[1:32:21] <MetroidSlayerP7> the ears wiggle! *cute noises*
[1:32:22] <%vVAstrAVv> AND INCAPABLE
[1:32:23] <$Quack_of_Dawn> What did I miss so far today?
[1:32:24] <Finakala> I love the fact that she MUST kill those guys, even though they walk calmly miles away from you
[1:32:25] <+BlueHolli> let this girl play Sol

[1:34:09] <Prism_Wing> triStare
[1:34:12] <+RealThiele> fuck no tits guy, tits are great
[1:34:18] <%hewlettfan96> Paige pees out her breasticles
[1:34:23] <KaitlynnHere> That mustard is a weird shade of green
[1:34:25] <MileenaTheOni> Maybe no tits guy is more of an ass man.
[1:34:26] <cyb3r_demon> ppl who hate booba prob just jealous of booba
[1:34:27] <Mattais88> Wow, it's been 20 years and I can still pick that tune out.
[1:34:31] <devanmuse> I wonder if Paige is going to update her BRB screen and other stream stuff to reflect her new Vtuber persona
[1:34:32] <Laecerelius> I mean milk is just tit pee if you think about it
[1:34:35] <Finakala> It's Paige brand green mustard
[1:34:36] <Prism_Wing> who the fuck said no tits?
[1:34:38] <MarylandJutsu> i'm just happy zangief is sleeping and not trying to sleep on paige
[1:34:38] <+Lunarhawk> still thinking bout that guy calling paige a hot woman and then quee a beta male after he told her that
[1:34:39] <leinadtonu> Paige's boobs have got to go if she wants to be a pro gamer
[1:34:44] <dinnydanny777> Milk is tit vomit
[1:34:45] <+necrocannibal2> isn't it more like tit sweat?
[1:34:45] <$zyberion626> @kaitlynnhere clearly the bottle she stores under the bed
[1:34:49] <@SoFarFetched> I always assume people "get off" to complaining about things cause they tend to just stay the entire stream and just complain geefShrug
[1:34:53] <cyb3r_demon> milk is boob pee
[1:34:54] <%Ranryu692> remember everyone, pee is stored as a gas until it mixes with air and becomes a liquid
[1:34:58] <@SoFarFetched> and its like "you know you're free to leave whenever"
[1:35:08] <+RealThiele> ah, contrarian fuckers
[1:35:09] <MileenaTheOni> Milk is just... peach saliva? I don;t fuckin' know.
[1:35:16] <%samTUMZfestival> I bet there's some chemical released that makes it feel right, FarFetched
[1:35:18] <$zyberion626> @sofarfetched I'm annoyed but also very lazy
[1:35:20] <%tuesti> tuesti subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 2 months! anime girls can't pee nooooooooo
[1:35:21] <dekkitout> @Ranryu692 I do not believe you. Furthermore, they are stored in the balls.
[1:35:23] <balthazar758> @sofarfetched that must be the reason. until they get call out.
[1:35:24] <KaitlynnHere> @zyberion626 it could also be that shrek themed mustard. Member that shit?
[1:35:37] <%Ranryu692> @Ranryu692 yes, in gaseous form
[1:35:39] <Finakala> It's Monster Energy Mayonnaise, spoilers
[1:35:40] <%maenos2> @kaitlynnhere n-no? sheep mustard?
[1:35:41] <dinnydanny777> if pee is stored in the balls, is poop stored in the boobs
[1:35:41] <+RealThiele> maybe she just put poison in a mustard bottle
[1:35:43] <+QueequegTheater> @SoFarFetched I wish those people would leave. Look at the top post on the 2bfp sub right now, and know that people are bitching about it
[1:35:48] <%maenos2> shrek
[1:35:52] <Dementedpenguin> WAIT, there was shrek themed mustard?
[1:35:53] <%maenos2> stupid autocorrect
[1:35:55] <Dementedpenguin> WTF
[1:35:58] <$zyberion626> @kaitlynnhere I remember the crazy ketchup too
[1:36:03] <%KeiganOfAstora> @SoFarFetched Ugh...
[1:36:07] <MileenaTheOni> There was also that weird purple ketchup.
[1:36:09] <+ChaosVulpes> Wait, is this the Sonic SatAM theme song? IT IS!
[1:36:11] <%samTUMZfestival> Why can't people be happy it didn't implode? Why can't people be hapy for the creators?
[1:36:14] <KaitlynnHere> @maenos2 there was shrek themed mustard and ketchup
[1:36:16] <BigFingerRo> @Dementedpenguin And hulk themed hershey's syrup, that was DARK green
[1:36:22] <%maenos2> @kaitlynnhere that sounds vile
[1:36:26] <Laecerelius> Oh yeah, the cursed purple ketchup
[1:36:30] <KaitlynnHere> To promote the first movie

[1:36:49] <dinnydanny777> m6kwShradow
[1:36:53] <%samTUMZfestival> @SoFarFetched It's almost as bad "THIS IS NOT WHAT I'M USED TO I HATE IT."
[1:36:53] <KaitlynnHere> It was basically mustard and ketchup with a lot of food coloring
[1:36:59] <MileenaTheOni> You know what else is cursed? There's fuckin cotton candy mac and cheese now.
[1:37:05] <%Ranryu692> the green ketchup wasn't too bad, but my mind just couldn't accept the purple ketchup. it looked too gross on the plate
[1:37:20] <%maenos2> @mileenatheoni saw someone eat it say it isn't as sweet as y oud think
[1:37:25] <+RealThiele> theres too much sugar in shit
[1:37:26] <$JoshManVGH> @mileenatheoni I refuse the notion that this is a thing
[1:37:35] <CanadianAnimatorGuy> They weren't actually angry it seemed, just being like "how come her vtuber is bigger, it's not accurate lol"
[1:37:43] <CanadianAnimatorGuy> But now they deleted their Twitch account sooo

[1:38:54] <faintsmile> @SoFarFetched you'd think the fox ears would be a bigger problem if we're going for "accuracy" LUL
[1:38:56] <+Jonny_Worldbeater> BABA HAS CEASED TO BE
[1:39:00] <Prism_Wing> @sofarfetched You had it right the first time
[1:39:03] <MayorRev> he ceases to be
[1:39:07] <+MooseIsGoose> Did you shove salami and then ham and then bread in your mouth. Why did you not just make a sandwich.
[1:39:08] <$RetroCop87> this does not look like bloodborne, because this looks like 60fps
[1:39:10] <%IAmAkiva> WALL.
[1:39:17] <postmortempc> So paige is pregnant confirmed I hear it in her voice
[1:39:23] <%samTUMZfestival> She made it in her mouth, that's not weird.

[1:40:30] <faintsmile> corpseshaming smh
[1:40:32] <%samTUMZfestival> They shame themselves.
[1:40:34] <MileenaTheOni> Paige playing Dark Souls is fitting, given the morals about hubris. XD
[1:40:37] <+badchoice5> slut shaming, with THAT avatar, gasp
[1:40:39] <$JoshManVGH> Don't kink shame the almost skeletons!
[1:40:41] <$zyberion626> or unlife

[1:40:52] <+dalmek> I forreal thought you were gonna call the fireball slutty
[1:40:56] <Zerenis> Except for Pat’s choices. Paige never supports those. No matter how right they are

[1:41:05] <Prevot> stupid sexy ice mummies
[1:41:09] <%AncelDeLambert> skelesluts
[1:41:10] <leinadtonu> skeletons can't be slutty, can they?
[1:41:11] <KevinJevinKevinThe4th> How much is it for Paige to read a donation
[1:41:11] <Monkeyweed21> does Paige prefer guy or girl skeletons?
[1:41:14] <Prism_Wing> icing all these hos
[1:41:18] <+necrocannibal2> HOLY SHIT YOU WERE LUCKY
[1:41:19] <CanadianAnimatorGuy> Why ISN'T Paige a skeleton vtuber?
[1:41:19] <+realm_forge> @rumtumtugnutz The Boondocks was right. White people are easily swayed by fancy cheese
[1:41:20] <%Lion_kun> WHY DID SHE SWING AGAIN
[1:41:26] <KaitlynnHere> @leinadtonu it depends on who you ask…
[1:41:26] <%AncelDeLambert> time to remember that weapon arts exist

[1:41:36] <MayorRev> paige do you have your gamer fuel
[1:41:37] <MileenaTheOni> These skeletons take after their mother, Mettaton, not their father, Papyrus.
[1:41:38] <$zyberion626> alright taking all bets, how many times does she die here
[1:41:39] <%ElkRiverDog> Not even a little

[1:42:03] <Quigsies> Nioh 2 is also amazing
[1:42:03] <%tsubakiparadox> but Nioh 2 is so damn good tho
[1:42:07] <%Lion_kun> Nioh 2 is super easy when you use tonfas and make a tank regen build
[1:42:13] <%Agami23> just play with magic.
[1:42:14] <UlriktheSlayer1> i fucking loved nioh 2
[1:42:16] <%Lion_kun> I walked over every boss.
[1:42:16] <+necrocannibal2> NICE DODGE
[1:42:16] <+QueequegTheater> BUT I JUST WANNA KILL THE BIG GOAT MONSTER
[1:42:22] <+MooseIsGoose> Nioh 2 is on the back burner for me it is freaking hard
[1:42:23] <KaitlynnHere> I never got past the tutorial…. I don’t you I was 8 at the time
[1:42:25] <%tsubakiparadox> I had so much fun with Nioh 2

[1:42:33] <KaitlynnHere> Mind you

[1:42:35] <Hydrapissed> wait wtf?
[1:42:36] <%KeiganOfAstora> WHAT?!
[1:42:36] <+tempestzephyr> I don't think max even finished nioh 2
[1:42:37] <MileenaTheOni> @Lion_kun That's because it's not FromSoft, and they're not scared of miracle builds. XD

[1:42:49] <+necrocannibal2> HOW DO YOU NOT LIKE PIZZA
[1:42:50] <theshillman> pat explain
[1:42:50] <+MooseIsGoose> Why
[1:42:50] <Laecerelius> The tank regen build falls apart once you get to the higher difficulties but yeah it rocks for the first like three difficulties
[1:42:51] <$JoshManVGH> Pizza is ambrosia.
[1:42:52] <SivShele> I'm with you Pat pizza sucks
[1:42:52] <%IAmAkiva> PATRICK.
[1:42:52] <+badchoice5> I'm eating pizza right now!
[1:42:52] <+necrocannibal2> PAAAAAAAAT
[1:42:52] <Monkeyweed21> ITS A UNIVERSAL FOOD
[1:42:52] <+Mr_Pylon> Oh I had forgotten this Pat lore
[1:42:52] <+QueequegTheater> @PeachSaliva Pat what the fuck is wrong with you, you weird cube
[1:42:52] <Void_The_Dark> Send him to jail
[1:42:55] <mr_saturday93> IS PAT BROKEN
[1:42:55] <andresisant> PAT WTF dude
[1:42:56] <+TheMadeMember> Wtf unsubbing rn
[1:42:56] <theloganbrand> Pizza? Pizza shit
[1:42:56] <+Lunarhawk> Pizza is a medium pat, its like saying you dont like movies or music
[1:42:57] <%KeiganOfAstora> New lore holy shit
[1:42:58] <ItsMisterJason> Everybody does like Pizza, but Pat isn't everybody
[1:42:59] <TheYellowcouch> I get you Pat. Pizza is kinda mid
[1:43:01] <BigFingerRo> THE HARDEST PUSH UNDER THE BUS EVER
[1:43:01] <$zyberion626> respect for Pat go down
[1:43:01] <andresisant> He broken
[1:43:01] <shabop> how does nioh 2 compare to 1 difficulty wise? I found 1 harder than DS
[1:43:02] <Kristoffers> Have you tried a pizza
[1:43:02] <+dalmek> chat, Pat doesn't like music either
[1:43:02] <yuggie_the_shark> this is the worst take pat has ever had
[1:43:03] <Profmcstevie> He not eata da pizza?
[1:43:03] <primaryfire> ???
[1:43:05] <+WildFyrre> Pat? more like RAT for not liking pizza. got im
[1:43:06] <%hewlettfan96> WTF do you have a spirit Pat??
[1:43:06] <rekinom> My grandpa HATES pizza and he ate it every Friday for 30 years because it was the one day a week my grandma didn't have to cook
[1:43:07] <+Keaton_x> I'm with Pat, pizza is overrated
[1:43:07] <theshillman> pat you posted cringe, you will lose subscribers
[1:43:10] <mr_saturday93> Pat has someone wron with him
[1:43:11] <Monkeyweed21> ITS POPULAR IN LITERALLY EVERY CONTINENT
[1:43:12] <+emperordread> Is it an OCD thing or a taste thing?
[1:43:12] <Luna_Selenic> Seriously Pat, that is actually the worst thing you've ever said
[1:43:13] <%SveriSageAdvice> i thought Pat only hated pepperoni because of the spoiled rotten kids who wouldnt eat anything else
[1:43:13] <notsoy> pizza is a pretty high-floor food
[1:43:13] <+necrocannibal2> I lost all my respect for Pat
[1:43:14] <KaitlynnHere> You need to sneak pizza into his mouth while he’s asleep
[1:43:14] <$Quack_of_Dawn> Met someone in a discord that doesn't like sauce or liquids on their food. Like no spaghetti sauce, no cereal with milk, no dipping...
[1:43:15] <andresisant> teriible things I just discovered
[1:43:15] <brisk_dacat> what about a nice Calzone
[1:43:15] <%AncelDeLambert> well straight back at ya, no
[1:43:17] <postmortempc> Pizza is just rose flavored bread
[1:43:17] <%BlackStarAura> NOOOO Pat why not pizza
[1:43:17] <%Estuko> sorry if this was answered, is the VTuber a permanent decision? It's super cute
[1:43:17] <bob900000> what food does pat like
[1:43:19] <%AncelDeLambert> No, Pat, wrong
[1:43:19] <%rumtumtugnutz> Pat said on a stream like two years ago that he particularly doesn;t like Pepperoni pizza and he was ambivalent about other pizza
[1:43:20] <happy_void> that is pretty weird
[1:43:23] <digaogrunge> Is Canadian pizza bad?
[1:43:24] <notsoy> and bad pizza is like bad sex - it's still pretty good
[1:43:24] <WakeUpThrow> Why don't you like it?
[1:43:25] <%Lion_kun> 2 is easier because of the counter system
[1:43:25] <peachy996> I knew a guy who hated Pizza, He was an asshole
[1:43:26] <%hewlettfan96> Why do you hate Pizza So?
[1:43:27] <Profmcstevie> You have posted cringe, you are going to lose Vods
[1:43:27] <MileenaTheOni> I wonder how he feels about other flatbreads.
[1:43:27] <rosemon5001> @Hydrapissed you know we will get the pro versions before she finishes this game another giant game like that? thats like 2 console gens in the future content
[1:43:27] <Mirrorcatch> pizza is the foundational foodstuff upon which all others are built
[1:43:28] <%AncelDeLambert> NO IT ISNT!!!
[1:43:31] <%doomunderthestairs> basically
[1:43:31] <%tsubakiparadox> what about flatbread with tomato sauce, cheese, and pepperoni? Kappa
[1:43:32] <+StevorenoElcamino> i don’t get that either cuz there’s like so many types of pizza.
[1:43:33] <freelancebabymaker> NO ITS NOT
[1:43:34] <KaitlynnHere> What is the logic?
[1:43:35] <andresisant> That´s just wrong my dude I´m sorry
[1:43:36] <freelancebabymaker> STOP THIS
[1:43:37] <+QueequegTheater> I sometimes eat pizzas like whole calzones
[1:43:37] <+SiameseDuck> Crunchyoli
[1:43:37] <%rumtumtugnutz> A calzone is a ravioli
[1:43:37] <glass_marcus> I know someone who hates any kind of bread
[1:43:40] <$Draylle> it's a pizza turnover
[1:43:40] <%maenos2> YEAH CALZONSZ RULE
[1:43:42] <+SenorCounter> It's basically an Empanada
[1:43:43] <%Birdigalore> Calzone with sauce in or sauce out?
[1:43:43] <+Mr_Pylon> Since Pat loves eating cheese like an apple maybe he only likes raw cheese?
[1:43:46] <brisk_dacat> dont ruin calzone paige
[1:43:47] <$RetroCop87> crunchy ravioli is undercooked pasta
[1:43:49] <+WildFyrre> CRUNCY RAVIOLI PAT
[1:43:49] <MileenaTheOni> UGH
[1:43:49] <andresisant> Yep a big ass Empanada
[1:43:50] <KaitlynnHere> Duuude!
[1:43:51] <+Tornix> I'll take a calzone over a pizza any day
[1:43:53] <+MooseIsGoose> You can have crunchy ravioli you just deep fry them
[1:43:53] <%AncelDeLambert> Chrunchyoli Crunchyoli give me the formuloli
[1:43:54] <+badchoice5> calzones are just pizza for bread lovers
[1:43:55] <%ElkRiverDog> Hey! Crunchy ravioli is the shit!
[1:43:55] <%rumtumtugnutz> What is the difference between a calzone and a stromboli
[1:43:57] <%SveriSageAdvice> Paige you just reminded me that fried ravioli exists and now i want it again
[1:43:57] <CzeekyTV> @Birdigalore both
[1:44:02] <+sn0rlaxxxx> is this a no hit no death run?
[1:44:03] <TheYellowcouch> When you're gluten intolerant you just have to make do with whatever the pizzeria dragged out of the dumpster to put on your plate
[1:44:05] <MetroidSlayerP7> ravioli is pasta, though
[1:44:05] <$JoshManVGH> i can respect that. Some shit, every part of it can be delicious, but put them in the wrong configuration and people bounce right off of it. Like meatloaf.
[1:44:06] <+QueequegTheater> @PeachSaliva I want Pat to know that I will occasionally microwave a pizza and eat it warm like a calzone
[1:44:13] <BigFingerRo> So, 2 hrs in and we've beaten one mini boss
[1:44:18] <MileenaTheOni> I have a friend who puts ravioli on pizza. It's weird.
[1:44:21] <%AncelDeLambert> I mean, cauliflower crust exists and it's pretty good
[1:44:28] <+QueequegTheater> Don't you blame Jesus, he knows how to dodge
[1:44:31] <$GarbageNirvana> So when is Pat getting his vtuber avatar
[1:44:37] <Dementedpenguin> Well
[1:44:40] <%rumtumtugnutz> Cauliflower crust pizza isn't pizza. It's a baked salad.
[1:44:40] <%SophiaAmoreaVeritas> You're a bit more warmed up.
[1:44:44] <tomdwarf> Oh my god. She did it
[1:44:44] <Hydrapissed> is it over?
[1:44:45] <%AncelDeLambert> about dang time
[1:44:45] <MetroidSlayerP7> I'd put ravioli on pizza, not gonna lie
[1:44:46] <%GalacticaPhanto> @rumtumtugnutz Calzone is folded and usually have more sauce and Stromboli is rolled and has more toppings

[1:44:54] <%ospreyworks> Pizza is overrated
[1:44:54] <+onemoresunday> She did what?
[1:44:55] <MileenaTheOni> @QueequegTheater Jesus doesn't dodge. 'Turn the other cheek' implies that he parries.
[1:44:55] <digaogrunge> wowowowow
[1:45:00] <KaitlynnHere> @queequegtheater true, when he was on the cross he was dodging the big pointy stick like it was no problem
[1:45:02] <+Tornix> clutch
[1:45:05] <BigFingerRo> @Jetsfantasy Goddamnit ain't that the truth
[1:45:10] <rosemon5001> every thin pizza is a waste of food same whit deep dish medium homemade is the way to go

[1:45:57] <KaitlynnHere> @necrocannibal2 compared to what? Italian pizza?
[1:46:00] <%Ranryu692> this feels like unused assets town
[1:46:00] <$JoshManVGH> @necrocannibal2 Which version?
[1:46:01] <%rumtumtugnutz> Since Quebec isn't a real place, they probably just have worse pizza than real places.
[1:46:01] <%SophiaAmoreaVeritas> The joke is that the Dark Souls game has a bunch of Bloodborne DNA.
[1:46:02] <djblue_shift> goddamn how much did that bitch have to drink
[1:46:03] <Kristoffers> these guys sure can gargle

[2:12:49] <Hydrapissed> THERE IS LOOT WORTH IT down there
[2:12:49] <+CarnivorousBrain> FRC chalices are the best part of Bloodborne. free roaming bosses, vileblood hunters, powerful gems
[2:12:50] <%SophiaAmoreaVeritas> You're okay.
[2:12:50] <+MooseIsGoose> This is a tough spot in the game

[2:13:18] <Wiiplayah43> The chalice dungeons have better level design, they're not actually bad. The Demon Ruins and Carthus Catacombs are *bad* chalice dungeons.
[2:13:19] <JDRizzle316> oh shit Peach is a vtuber now?
[2:13:27] <BoxNavy> elmow
[2:13:31] <NireFuster> Hey Paige quick question have you been enjoying DS3 more than DS2 thus far?
[2:13:32] <Monkeyweed21> there were DS2 streams where Paige made literally zero progress
[2:13:34] <Finakala> Horsefuck Valley is the worst zone in the franchise

[2:15:27] <Finakala> Sully is gonna be tough but the staircase leading up to him is gonna be the real obstacle today I think. That particular staircase sucks
[2:15:28] <+JenovasPuppet> If you wait, they'll walk away and you can kill the ambush one by himself
[2:15:31] <@SoFarFetched> it does
[2:15:31] <MayorRev> hi peepeeeeeeee

[2:15:40] <%Ranryu692> and it looks like she's glaring at chat, too
[2:15:41] <+bustahwuulf> That was a good
[2:15:42] <+JenovasPuppet> OOOOOOOOOOF
[2:15:45] <%nichos7> And yet there it was
[2:15:49] <+Mr_Pylon> this is some big good, big strong, run head into monster
[2:15:49] <Foopoof> she rolls at exactly the wrong times LUL
[2:15:51] <$zyberion626> no block, no dodge, panic, die
[2:15:52] <mr_saturday93> Paige dont drink when they are about to hit you
[2:15:52] <freelancebabymaker> ugh i need to do my dishes
[2:15:57] <Hydrapissed> she only moves in 4 directions
[2:16:08] <rustybuckethead21> @rustybuckethead21 is new here. Say hello! SeemsGood
[2:16:08] <+Taisuru> Is paige eating more salami?
[2:16:09] <+Flapjack_Boi> Oh wow peach did you do something with your hair?

[2:16:15] <TheYellowcouch> Plump, sweet and begging for cream
[2:16:16] <Hydrapissed> ^
[2:16:20] <%geekjacob> she beat bloodborne
[2:16:27] <+JenovasPuppet> I'd say the avatar is blocking the soul counter, but we all know it's 0
[2:16:28] <%geekjacob> have faith
[2:16:30] <MileenaTheOni> Rolling into the swings instead of through them, mind you.
[2:16:36] <Hydrapissed> Murder boner
[2:16:38] <Laecerelius> She beat the fuck outta Bloodborne
[2:16:41] <%nichos7> Don't get excited
[2:16:44] <$zyberion626> @geekjacob bloodborne rewards aggressive button mashing though
[2:16:45] <+MisterAvry> good
[2:16:45] <mr_saturday93> Always remember the hyper armor you get when you swing your hammar paige
[2:16:48] <postmortempc> So I showed a friend your shadow puzzle attempt recently
[2:16:49] <TournamentArc> Paige dodges INTO the bad times instead of AWAY from them, like a coward would
[2:16:50] <Zerenis> Lack of any coherent strategy is definitely the issue
[2:16:51] <+MisterAvry> bad
[2:16:52] <PwnyB> Can we get a Southpark style Canadian VTuber version of patt to sit next to Paige so we can see those side glances connect? lol
[2:16:53] <Foopoof> rolled
[2:16:53] <MileenaTheOni> ...Think she'd roll better with the Kirk set? XD
[2:16:55] <Hydrapissed> maybe try the weapon art then swing paige
[2:16:55] <@SoFarFetched> she's getting TOO distracted by skeleton
[2:16:56] <+JusTTheGuyYouNeed> Almost progress
[2:16:59] <rosemon5001> thats how BOOBA mafia works
[2:17:01] <%SophiaAmoreaVeritas> @TournamentArc This is true.
[2:17:06] <$zyberion626> no
[2:17:12] <+MisterAvry> that was a good try
[2:17:25] <@SoFarFetched> Paige is forgetting she's playing the game and just thinking about sexy skeletons smashing her literally and figuratively geefPlz
[2:17:27] <+polothegreatest> psaCrazyhand psaCrazyhead psaBlep

[2:18:18] <Prism_Wing> :)
[2:18:20] <BigFingerRo> HOW DID SHE MAKE IT PAST ABYSS?
[2:18:20] <mr_saturday93> Demon king was old and brittle like paige so it was a even match
[2:18:21] <BigYanno> One day paige will learn she can roll away from the danger and heal
[2:18:23] <%Estuko> @Hydrapissed I mean, I beat demon king while I was falling asleep lol
[2:18:32] <RagnarokAM> Jesus, all the shit talking in chat. Do you people even like her?
[2:18:35] <$zyberion626> Paige gets progressively better but never retains information learned
[2:18:39] <%Ranryu692> that item's still sitting there, huh?

[2:19:30] <BigFingerRo> Man, I can't imagine what it would be like to be Paige's teacher in school
[2:19:31] <+JenovasPuppet> If Paige ever remotely indicated that she had a problem with the shit talking, you'd better believe it'd dry up in an instant.
[2:19:35] <+bustahwuulf> its our job
[2:19:35] <+Ne1son> @RagnarokAM And they'd be so right
[2:19:43] <+s_xylocalsingles> chat LOVES being smarmy to Paige

[2:24:02] <+Mr_Pylon> maybe you should thank Abraham Lincoln then
[2:24:04] <Laecerelius> The ghosts jumped from the moon to the town
[2:24:05] <snow_bush> Is that why honest Abe is haunting you?
[2:24:05] <BoxNavy> is that real? monkaS
