[0:05:12] <%TheOnlyStrayCat> cheer500 This is where the fun begins. Watching the inevitable spousal abuse as Pat says he knows the solution but waits for Paige to get it, and Paige ultimately doesn't, until the midget throttling begins. I now realize ''midget throttling'' could be a euphemism for handjob, and chuckled at it. I will shut up now.

[0:44:14] <deviljhojho94> Is the kingmaker game good?
[0:44:19] <deviljhojho94> Pathfinder is a dumb setting

[0:44:26] <element_of_loyalty> @PeachSaliva rub mustard in your eyes to heal them.
[0:44:27] <morat2255> Pathfinder is basically just 3.5e
[0:44:29] <%AncelDeLambert> it fucks up magic
[0:44:31] <OldOnyx> hell you can get forma from the plague star thing going on now pre-built
[0:44:35] <%jerree66> Man the whole porn thing is that some girl used to call herself RedHeadRedemption Which is Peach's old Twitter handle

[0:44:47] <Huntercd> Is there a way to get plat without paying for it?
[0:44:47] <%CyborgAV> Yeah, Pathfinder as a setting is pretty dumb
[0:44:49] <%zal_silverfang> @OldOnyx it was insane back in the day when it was keys. endless defense and survival for so much good stuff. less prime junk. massive forma drops
