[0:36:33] <$DesertPenguin> Put another song on the juke box baby
[0:36:33] <@Jekado> The guy who wrote cherry pie hated that song
[0:36:34] <karl_rex> When Dark Souls?
[0:36:34] <Aleate> boo
[0:36:35] <+OwlLightningMage> Pie is disgusting
[0:36:36] <Spydurman> Paige would be pie batter LUL

[0:36:53] <+Prism_Wing> LUL
[0:36:53] <+emperordread> Sing Dancing queen and replace every "ooooh" with "UwwwwwU"
[0:36:55] <DandyMackeroos> All of this is worth it
[0:36:56] <orpleborple> 🎂
[0:36:56] <+meatmaaan> but is a muffin just a small cake or it's own thing?
[0:36:57] <$Solidnick18> is that the gimmick
[0:36:58] <%Lunarhawk> Who cares about Dark Souls whens Dragons Dogma??? Netflix just announced the anime for september
[0:36:59] <Vaardvark> I would be fine with a 100% shitpost stream
[0:36:59] <+patriotrenegade> When's Dark Souls III
[0:36:59] <audrus> when stalling with plague?
[0:37:00] <Kalcom> then let's stall forever
[0:37:01] <+generalve> SHES FINALLY LEARNING THE WAYS OF PAT
[0:37:07] <Spydurman> ask more, this is better than Dark Souls
[0:37:07] <+CJett92> There was a Dark Souls stream here, it's a cake conversation now
[0:37:08] <TheLemuroid> Cheese cake is actually a pie
[0:37:09] <+RyTYoung> @commandersqueaks you've got to look it up, basically a biscuit base with caramel on top with bananas normally on top or whipped cream
[0:37:11] <Baeltyr> :O
[0:37:11] <@SoFarFetched> @peachy996 he unfortunately commited suicide too I believe.
[0:37:11] <srkAres> a really blown-out asshole
[0:37:13] <patrickvezinat> WHEN DARK SOULS
[0:37:13] <%AncelDeLambert> they only hated that song because they had to play it CONSTANTLY because it was a mistake to make it a single
[0:37:13] <%walternatorz> two best professional time wasters
[0:37:15] <$Solidnick18> yes i just saw
[0:37:15] <%Draylle> really?
[0:37:16] <Whiskey_T_Foxtrot> wot
[0:37:16] <Baeltyr> DRAGON DOGMA
[0:37:17] <Owkono> this could be the whole stream and I'd be happy
[0:37:19] <%depressed_skeleton> are skeletons cake too?!
[0:37:19] <@StridentSong> The delay between Paige's streams is because people keep asking
[0:37:19] <%Starotter70> AND IT'S CG
[0:37:20] <%PigGuy800> i hate coconut, not the taste the consistency
[0:37:22] <DandyMackeroos> Pat’s really rubbing off on her
[0:37:23] <+OwlLightningMage> Why?
[0:37:23] <%BallerSwagBro9k> OK THEN WHEN DONATION READING?
[0:37:24] <+primax104> we are a generation of procrastinators
[0:37:28] <wantedsafe471> hmm, might be good. look at castlevania
[0:37:30] <%CommanderSqueaks> What studio?
[0:37:31] <KingKZ> Why tho
[0:37:31] <+marsantas> Yeah, it'll finish before you get tot he first city in dragons dogma
[0:37:32] <$Solidnick18> if into free ain't the intro this anime trash
[0:37:36] <dalmek> CG! Coconut Gun
[0:37:42] <Vaardvark> Did you know wolves hunt in packs?
[0:37:42] <Kalcom> I mean it fits
[0:37:42] <+CptCreampuff16> only good cg show is Dragon Prince
[0:37:44] <+evbites> netflix making all the videogame anime
[0:37:45] <+Prism_Wing> Sure hope we're all alive at that time :)
[0:37:47] <theobble> I've never played Dragons Dogma :)
[0:37:48] <Broand> See that slice, watch it be, Topped by some whipping cream Ooohoooo
[0:37:48] <+OwlLightningMage> Dragon's Dogma does not have a good enough story for that
[0:37:54] <+ragingbrachy> monkaS
[0:37:59] <zamzoph> monkaS cvHazmat
[0:38:07] <DandyMackeroos> Never ask and you shall receives
[0:38:12] <$TrashLeviathan> therevare some good cg shows so maybe itll be good
[0:38:16] <%CommanderSqueaks> @OwlLightningMage It DOES mean the writers can do anything they want, so it MIGHT be good?
[0:38:28] <+meatmaaan> dragons dog mother?
[0:38:35] <+ragingbrachy> back to work monkaS
[0:38:42] <Senselessvirus> Just got here, did I miss the stream?
[0:38:42] <+OwlLightningMage> I guess.
[0:38:43] <+patriotrenegade> and some people have to live on a ventilator for the rest of their lives
[0:38:43] <%Joustar_> The after story of Dragon's Dogma would fall apart if the Arisen uttered at least 1 word.
[0:38:44] <+worldbrand> it can fuck you up for life even if you recover
[0:38:46] <+ragingbrachy> you better not leave the house
[0:38:46] <GraceTBM> My roommate got it, but I never got symptoms, I assume I did get it
[0:38:47] <KingKZ> Netflix needs to grow some balls and make a Stardew Valley anime.
[0:38:50] <+generalve> THATS NOT GOOD
[0:38:51] <+jessedouglas> hope you feel better!
[0:38:55] <+ragingbrachy> monkaS
[0:39:00] <DandyMackeroos> Please never leave
[0:39:03] <Dapper_Cactuar> haven't they learned CG in anime is usually a bad idea after the CG Berserk and Fist of the North Star animes and the fiasco with the CG in Overlord?
[0:39:09] <VirtuaRailith> I go for walks a lot. It's nice because no one else does it
[0:39:09] <soraabora> oh my god paige same

[0:39:40] <Dhurkst> @dapper_cactuar BUT MONEY THO

[0:40:01] <$SweetCheeksTVR> eyyyy
[0:40:02] <@SoFarFetched> you gotta scroll back before our big talk of "shits fucked"
[0:40:06] <+Invlux> They're only letting me stay out of work until the end of the month, and if I catch covid I will very much die :/
[0:40:08] <%ssjklyco> I've had a cough due to allergies for a few months, but I was more worried the first few weeks.
[0:40:08] <DandyMackeroos> Being scured of Rona makes sense
[0:40:17] <@SoFarFetched> or I can just resend them again.
[0:40:22] <jeffishype> im experiencing that for a friend who also has lupus, they've currently got like a super fucked up not cornona sickness and im just super worried about them, but im glad me giving them crazy person advice for staying safe
[0:40:23] <JonEWorldbeater> It begins again

[0:40:45] <r0termond> Is Pat sleeping?
[0:40:46] <+OwlLightningMage> Living isn't great either. Living is pretty overrated

[0:40:47] <$TrashLeviathan> is pat cake?
[0:40:49] <+ragingbrachy> i like it :)
[0:40:50] <@SoFarFetched> That's Pats?
[0:40:52] <devanmuse> I never got tested, but I'm all but certain that I had it back in February. Alternating between being asleep and fighting the worst fever of my life for a week. Somehow, though, neither of my parents, who I live with, got infected.
[0:40:55] <$DesertPenguin> Did you guys know that Snapple makes a Mango Tea now? It's fucking delicious
[0:41:11] <+ragingbrachy> plague drew korone? when? monkaS

[0:41:37] <%BLK_HRLQN_13> To answer how I feel, I feel soooo much better, I felt like shit for 2 weeks of being sick, but now I feel way better.
[0:41:37] <$NitronStreams> the struggle is real
[0:41:43] <$DesertPenguin> I'm good at sketches

[0:42:01] <Tucker0603> I'm friends with an artist, she's amazing but hates her work
[0:42:03] <+BubbaRands> "This is Shit" - Every Artist. EVER.
[0:42:03] <%ElkRiverDog> Picasso
[0:42:05] <%TheWinged7> @PeachSaliva my shit is trash, so i stopped drawing ~5 years ago and picked up coding sintead
[0:42:07] <JonEWorldbeater> Does the finished art ever look like you want it?
[0:42:08] <DandyMackeroos> If I eat an artist will I gain their powers?
[0:42:08] <+logoth_> You can't be the Low Tier God of the art world
[0:42:08] <+tweedler92> Cant stop
[0:42:12] <+OwlLightningMage> DON'T STOP HATING YOUR WORK IT MAKES YOU STRONGER
[0:42:13] <VirtuaRailith> I draw straight for the trashcan
[0:42:13] <Kalcom> the artist that costs 100000 dollars

[0:53:35] <+Meltdown547> I do expect Paige to get further, because Pat will offer her to go to another area when she gets frustrated, but Plague is gonna just go all in until it's done. Chariot's been on the backburner for awhile.

[0:56:59] <DandyMackeroos> @audrus A hard soul is a sign of humanity
[0:57:02] <koolkatdq> I thought people said this game looks ugly this is really pretty!!!
[0:57:03] <theobble> No
[0:57:07] <yeetdabsenpai69> no
[0:57:08] <+blastazoid26> @peachsaliva are you playing the dlc too?
[0:57:13] <$Solidnick18> you got dust
[0:57:15] <yeetdabsenpai69> why wouldnt you?
[0:57:18] <+necrocannibal2> Majula looks fine
[0:57:18] <Kalcom> dust
[0:57:21] <+bread_assassin> Jebaited Jebaited Jebaited Jebaited
[0:57:24] <DandyMackeroos> Peach will get blowed by the dlc
[0:57:27] <+ragingbrachy> :)
[0:57:27] <+necrocannibal2> rest of the game looks bad tho
[0:57:27] <audrus> in theory would you like to give a shard?
[0:57:31] <sourigoth> dont you have sublime bone dust ? to reinforce estus ?
[0:57:34] <%CommanderSqueaks> But WAIFU tho
[0:57:35] <srkAres> you mean like in Des?
[0:57:36] <%Lunarhawk> Didnt you need the lady in Demons
[0:57:37] <%OctaivianRex> But lady is pretty Eli.
[0:57:37] <e_maginary> its pleague i love that grumby guy
[0:57:38] <+patriotrenegade> yes
[0:57:39] <+meatmaaan> flask update 10.0
[0:57:43] <+RyTYoung> @peachsaliva did you play Sekiro when it came out?
[0:57:43] <Maids4lyfe> people wanted Demon's Souls again
[0:57:44] <filialpails> what's this anti-lady rhetoric
[0:57:46] <+NiceWizard> Plague hates using the ladies.
[0:57:46] <+encrouched> MORE LIKE ELIES!
[0:57:47] <+OwlLightningMage> Lady is pretty though.
[0:57:47] <+SilverDevilfish> But Plague you're not allowed to complain or the DeS players call you a noob Kappa
[0:57:48] <DandyMackeroos> The waifu is okay
[0:57:48] <Vaardvark> miyazaki loves level up waifus, his influence cannot be escaped
[0:57:52] <Ipsenscastle> I like the ladies, they give the game more personality
[0:57:54] <$TrashLeviathan> but waifus plague
[0:57:54] <+trekkie11041> maiden in black is the only level up lady thats not bad
[0:57:55] <DatAsuna> The waifus are better but maiden in black was the right way
[0:57:56] <$Solidnick18> also paige has the tooth but she did not good with it
[0:57:56] <wantedsafe471> bonfire-chan best waifu
[0:57:57] <DandyMackeroos> Even though she a board
[0:57:57] <Taarin> I forget how LONG this game is sometimes
[0:57:57] <VritraReiRei> Is Eli connected on an Ethernet cable? I'm surprised the audio drops occasionally
[0:57:57] <Phob05> Priscilla was going to be level up waifu in DS1
[0:57:58] <Ianrazz> But waifu is laifu @PlagueOfGripes
[0:57:59] <+patriotrenegade> no go back
[0:58:00] <%optimasmaximas> i really dont give a shit about needing to upgrade at the firekeeper
[0:58:01] <%barkon345> barkon345 subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 10 months, currently on a 9 month streak! damn so close to my 1 year subsiversery. as always thank you for the great content Paige, Im always happy to support
[0:58:02] <+zamatermort> Plague, the only game that you didn't need a person was DS1, it is the outlier, shhh
[0:58:03] <+OwlLightningMage> Plague's advice is bad. Lady is pretty
[0:58:04] <+jiggy_snipe> you can have a level up lady, she can't be character like the Maiden in Black
[0:58:06] <sosuke5> A LAY-DEE
[0:58:15] <+Arkfyre> here we go

[1:58:33] <%SirGO0SE> sonic da heehaw
[1:58:37] <+tigerfang86> SHE IS THE ONE NAMED SAILOR PEACH
[1:58:44] <%Conyst> so I've been listening to this is the background while exercising how far is she?
[1:58:46] <+FlameLoneWolf> He's the fastest thing ALIVE
[1:58:48] <+xeros720> the lyrics are even funnier given the knowledge can't really move
[1:58:50] <%CommanderSqueaks> So Pat is totally gonna flip when he sees Peach hasn't allocated her stats according to the MATH, right?
[1:58:51] <SweetCheeksTVR> Chibi Pat is great
[1:58:52] <%FacetiousAF> Kreygasm
[1:58:52] <+xeros720> that paige*
[1:58:56] <$Solidnick18> sonic he can realllllly move
[1:58:58] <Darkfire346> is this the Sonic theme or the Sailor Moon theme, they sound alike
[1:58:59] <$DesertPenguin> Did Paige have a breakdown?
[1:59:01] <@Calek> @Conyst killed the double dragonriders
[1:59:02] <SomersaultJustice> do a stream where you watch old sonic cartoons
[1:59:03] <Royvald> Never noticed the slime(?) on the donut
[1:59:03] <+TDotGoat> Sanic the heehaw

[1:59:09] <+keyoray> @tigerfang86 thank you, did not catch that rhythm before
[1:59:19] <LooneyToons8895> I love the mini angry pat... such a cute lil goblin
[1:59:27] <Buttku> i wish we could hear uncle eli
[1:59:32] <%CommanderSqueaks> @DesertPenguin She had a bladder breakdown
[1:59:34] <SweetCheeksTVR> tiny fucked up elmo
[1:59:37] <SweetCheeksTVR> is the best
[2:00:22] <Darkfire346> I prefer irl tiny emlo
[2:00:22] <%CommanderSqueaks> Pat stirs resetlessly in his slumber, but he does not know why, he only feels a... disturbance in reality as Plague convinces Peach to respect all of her points into Attunement and Lucky.
[2:00:36] <%CommanderSqueaks> **Luck
[2:00:42] <%BinaryFireball> luck builds are best builds
[2:00:49] <%Lordkeyblade> Lordkeyblade subscribed with Twitch Prime. They've subscribed for 2 months! 
[2:00:50] <+NWR_James> Lucky Paige is an oxymoron.
[2:00:58] <+NWR_James> DS2 would crash
[2:01:01] <%CommanderSqueaks> Peach is extremely lucky except when she's not.
[2:01:07] <%CommanderSqueaks> She either has great luck or terrible luck
[2:01:11] <Run44forrest> What happened ? Were balls exposed
[2:01:14] <Shotgun_Hobo1> Paige is Lucky Ted 2
[2:01:17] <+NWR_James> perpetually
[2:01:31] <$shurtal> Orange Blur, she is blind, Paige is Immobile. Ass Broke and Super High, Paige is Immobile. Peaches, she's really strong! Peaches, and SUPER WRONG! Peaches, She'll laugh until she Crii-ee-ii-ee-ies!
[2:01:34] <+AmanisHouseOfNonsense> Lucky Paige's only perk is that there's only 1 worm in her burger. There are no other buffs.
[2:01:48] <%BLK_HRLQN_13> I wsih Pat was here to get frustrated at Paige so that I can go LOL
[2:01:58] <+OwlLightningMage> Plague fought with Paige and they both died
[2:01:58] <+NWR_James> Lucky Paige eats glass. It misses
[2:02:26] <Shotgun_Hobo1> Lucky Paige eats poison in order to gain xp
[2:02:30] <+xeros720> max poison resist
[2:02:31] <%CommanderSqueaks> @BLK_HRLQN_13 It is fun, but with Plague copiloting Peach might beat DS2 before the end of 2022.
[2:02:39] <MyNameIsRasus> @Shotgun_Hobo1 that's just Paige
[2:02:42] <Darkfire346> lucky paige could perfect dodge old age and restart at age 21
[2:02:45] <aimlesshealer> Did she actually eat the glass, or did she just think she did?
[2:02:52] <+AcrutaLao> Hullo
[2:02:52] <%CommanderSqueaks> She absolutely ate glass
[2:02:54] <SweetCheeksTVR> Hullo

[2:03:29] <+jiggy_snipe> the mustard is the main course, the meat is her sides
[2:03:31] <aimlesshealer> That salami better not be on any bread
[2:03:32] <+ragingbrachy> is paige gonna eat a shitton of salami like that time she ate all the bacon?

[2:09:16] <$DocMadfox> Arin apparently had to say N****r 30ish times after picking up a black dude for uber to "get it out of his system" according to one of his art streams. So 'good guy' is stretching it.

[2:10:11] <%BinaryFireball> the twist: the lysol is covered in ball sweat
[2:10:13] <+jiggy_snipe> for many reasons
[2:10:14] <SomersaultJustice> if you had balls you would do it too

[2:10:28] <srkAres> why are you always touching your boobs
[2:10:29] <dustworthmain> it's important
[2:10:29] <freelancebabymaker> the answer is that balls are horrible things
[2:10:29] <Darkfire346> get back at him by smashing your box on stuff
[2:10:30] <Spydurman> they itch
[2:10:30] <%adolphinwizard> You have to keep the wrinkles out
[2:10:31] <+AngriestAngryArtist> testicular cancer check
[2:10:31] <$wolfofsound> @PeachSaliva now that I work from home I'm often holding my balls on a service call
[2:10:32] <CrypticMochi> The wrinkles itch
[2:10:32] <nibble_nuts> feels good
[2:10:33] <%dekkitout> They get off axis sometimes....
[2:10:34] <+patriotrenegade> not like that!
[2:10:34] <$shurtal> Sticky
[2:10:35] <+xeros720> you spend too much time around hairy ball people
[2:10:35] <RunningNGunning> So Paige what you're telling us is that by using the controller you're touching Pat's balls with your salami
[2:10:36] <%walternatorz> imagine if your vagina was on the outside of the body flopping around and getting stuck on itself
[2:10:37] <$DocMadfox> THey. Itch
[2:10:37] <+BubbaRands> Why scratch your head?
[2:10:37] <%thejimjamz> DON'T TELL HER SHE CAN'T KNOW THE SECRETS
[2:10:39] <+Captain_Doomsday> Well, I wash my hands after they're oozing nut-sweat.
[2:10:39] <ha2ken> Eli is a good boi...non-ball-toucher
[2:10:41] <xxshadowxx416> they itchy and there in wrong place
[2:10:41] <cosmicgoatee> they're attached
[2:10:42] <ECRead> They itch sometimes?
[2:10:42] <+JenovasPuppet> Wait she's already been up here? How much stream did I miss?
[2:10:42] <+Metballs> Sometimes they need to be shuffled
[2:10:42] <SwindlerOfProgress> I typically don't go around just touching my balls, no
[2:10:43] <DandyMackeroos> Hair collects sweat and sweat create irritant.
[2:10:45] <$alex_id> Cause they're there
[2:10:47] <+PaladinDupre> Im touchin my balls RIGHT NOW
[2:10:47] <freelancebabymaker> just imagine you had a shopping bag in your pants at all times
[2:10:47] <$DocMadfox> Imagine if you vagina flaps itched
[2:10:48] <BoneSkore> pat is genius for keeping cleaning whipes by the controllers
[2:10:48] <KingKZ> They either itch or cling to the thigh.
[2:10:49] <Monkeyweed21> BALLS ITCH BAD
[2:10:49] <Darkfire346> SHE CANT KNOW OUR SECRETS
[2:10:50] <+CptCreampuff16> itch or stuck to thigh
[2:10:50] <steph_the_doll> my dad does the same thing and his ass
[2:10:51] <+StreamStopA> Nuts are itchy 24 7
[2:10:52] <$Solidnick18> they stick like those stick hand slappers
[2:10:53] <Sunstalker> They get in a fold or start sticking lto your legs like those rubber hands you sling at the wall as a kid
[2:10:53] <%Joustar_> not in goddamn public NotLikeThis
[2:10:53] <+xeros720> does pat even wear underwear at home?
[2:10:54] <Zaphire_Saucypants> that and readjusting
[2:10:57] <%studleydoorite> women adjust their boobs all the time, you don't see us complaining
[2:10:58] <filialpails> sometimes our balls get lost and we have to find them again
[2:10:58] <Kalcom> it's just balls
[2:10:59] <$arcielardor> Eli can't see his balls
[2:11:00] <TheZearGuy> So you touch your boobs? There you go.
[2:11:01] <BoneSkore> cuz they itch
[2:11:01] <Zaphire_Saucypants> gotta adjust yo balls
[2:11:05] <coreyyotto> They legit just never feel comfortable. Like, they're always getting pinched somewhere and shit. Just all around really bad anatomical design.
[2:11:06] <+Captain_Doomsday> What underwear are you people wearing to be in PERPETUAL ITCH?
[2:11:07] <%optimasmaximas> @PeachSaliva why would you ever scratch a part of your body, the same reason
[2:11:08] <AlphaTauri> the safest way is a straight line
[2:11:17] <seniormeatbox> Paige, does your gooch NOT itch?
[2:11:25] <+ragingbrachy> welp
[2:11:26] <+Remery_> sometimes it itch but it's whatever

[2:11:30] <+MoonObscure> <......<
[2:11:31] <%ultimatetotoro> so to break guy code as it were. guys scratch their balls because they are sticky and uncomfortable. kinda of like when one boob is sagging over another, but worse because it's damp.
[2:11:31] <Laecerelius> WHOOPS! All doom!
[2:11:31] <+zamatermort> LUL
[2:11:31] <+xeros720> should've started with that, plague

[2:11:52] <%optimasmaximas> yes @PeachSaliva
[2:11:55] <coreyyotto> yes
[2:11:55] <Coystick> The real progress was the deaths we made along the way
[2:11:55] <+Jaysky> Ye

[2:11:56] <$Solidnick18> yes
[2:11:57] <%maenos2> yes paige

[2:11:57] <satyr_king> yes
[2:11:58] <%dekkitout> Sometimes
[2:11:58] <+ChestMimik> Big sweaty balls
[2:11:58] <%SirGO0SE> you ever feel your bazongers?
[2:11:58] <floralkami> @peachsaliva do you know how you/women adjust their boobs? it's that
[2:11:59] <cosmicgoatee> sometimes
[2:11:59] <SomersaultJustice> balls are on a separate cooldown
[2:12:01] <DFireCreations> yes
[2:12:02] <+ragingbrachy> what is wrong with your balls chat
[2:12:04] <+lethallunacyx> It's in the fold zone
[2:12:04] <moosemonkey397> like armpits
[2:12:05] <$wolfofsound> LUL
[2:12:05] <Zaphire_Saucypants> think boob sweat but with balls
[2:12:05] <%FacetiousAF> yes paige there's a lot of sweat down there
[2:12:06] <+JenovasPuppet> Balls stick
[2:12:08] <hussdogrob> yes they are damp af when warm
[2:12:09] <$wolfofsound> THEY DO
[2:12:09] <%studleydoorite> they're the 2nd thing to get sweaty after armpits
[2:12:11] <+Remery_> sometimes
[2:12:11] <%maenos2> yes they can stick to your leg
[2:12:12] <%Joustar_> ya'll need to invest in some better damn underwear
[2:12:13] <DuoScratch> @PeachSaliva it's like an underboob, just replace boob with ball, and they sweat.
[2:12:16] <Monkeyweed21> They are a focal point for sweat and itchy
[2:12:17] <aimlesshealer> The boob comparison makes sense to me
[2:12:19] <DandyMackeroos> Sweat happens sometimes
[2:12:20] <+GuildmasterAhnonay> They do
[2:12:21] <cosmicgoatee> doesnt wear briefs
[2:12:22] <%Brother_Coduss> In the Southern US theres a constant condition called swamp sack where it's hot, damp, and sticky down there due to the humidity
[2:12:24] <$Solidnick18> i hate it
[2:12:24] <ha2ken> They need to be aired out sometimes
[2:12:25] <coreyyotto> I don't have a choice I live in florida.
[2:12:26] <+worldbrand> LUL
[2:12:27] <+ragingbrachy> balls are just smaller boobs
[2:12:28] <+Remery_> boxer briefs
[2:12:29] <Hydrapissed> LOL
[2:12:31] <$DocMadfox> ... Balls don't stick to your leg normally, Paige
[2:12:33] <$wolfofsound> @Brother_Coduss it's legit

[2:12:37] <Hydrapissed> HAVEL yellign oh no bad man gets me everytime
[2:12:41] <DandyMackeroos> @brother_coduss Yeh, sounds right
[2:12:41] <%Joustar_> Boxer briefs > everything else
[2:12:42] <Dakuu75> If your balls are STICKING to you, then you have a hygiene problem
[2:12:43] <+worldbrand> boxer briefs are truly wonderful
[2:12:47] <+lethallunacyx> There should be ball washing stations everywhere
[2:12:48] <AlphaTauri> jump it
[2:12:49] <+ragingbrachy> hmmm
[2:12:50] <+xeros720> plague, as he sits in position waiting for them to sculpt his imagine in marble, " no i'm pretty good"
[2:12:50] <MyNameIsRasus> boxer briefs master race
[2:12:54] <%ultimatetotoro> @coreyyotto sucks. swamp sack is full to brime in Florida
[2:12:54] <wantedsafe471> Ladder close, Paige
[2:12:58] <+CptCreampuff16> @Joustar_ its not the underwear its thigh hair rubbing your balls or sweaty balls sticking to thighs
[2:12:58] <$wolfofsound> boxer briefs make me feel too confined, my balls need to wander
[2:13:00] <%Lunarhawk> wow!
[2:13:03] <floralkami> @peachsaliva we have to readjust our balls the same way women readjust their boobs
[2:13:03] <heartlesshealer> Balls get even sweatier than other parts because they have to be constantly suffocated for politeness regardless of how hot it is.
[2:13:03] <+Remery_> ex stole my favorite boxer breifs :(
[2:13:06] <LoneFonte> it gets especially worse in hot climates
[2:13:06] <$Solidnick18> oh wow

[2:31:43] <Laecerelius> They succeed at least once and then they fail once you know how to find one
[2:31:44] <+jiggy_snipe> needs more mimic types
[2:31:45] <srkAres> yeah, paige proves you worng, eli
[2:31:47] <%walternatorz> Paige let's her guard down too much with Eli. Her bullshit radar is overactive with Pat.
[2:31:52] <+patriotrenegade> not Paige tho
[2:31:52] <%adolphinwizard> Myth Busted
[2:31:54] <zamzoph> The first mimic in DS! isn't until SEN'S FORTRESS!
[2:31:54] <%CommanderSqueaks> Plague, like Peach JUST did, right?
[2:31:56] <NaturalGear> not Paige LUL
[2:31:57] <+Jaysky> Oh no! not the box ouwchie oof that weawwy huwwt
[2:31:59] <+FlameLoneWolf> Unless you're Paige
[2:32:12] <%CommanderSqueaks> Plague, Peach completely destroys your hypothesis.
[2:32:17] <%SMuffinMan> FF9 did Mimics better
[2:32:17] <+WutangchickeN> psaCrazyhand psaCrazyhead psaCrazyhand psaCrazyhead psaCrazyhand psaCrazyhead
[2:32:26] <2fcd_twitch> If they remember to do that
[2:32:28] <@Calek> Mimics suck in every game they're in
[2:32:30] <coreyyotto> Bonfire mimics tho
[2:32:30] <+someyounguy1> plague its another thing to punish greed and haste
[2:32:33] <+JenovasPuppet> LUL
[2:32:34] <$DesertPenguin> Some people play fast and don't pay attention
[2:32:36] <+Jaysky> I wost my dawk souwws how am i going to go on pwaying now? UwU
[2:32:39] <Dakuu75> could make them immune to friendly-fire from other monsters?
[2:32:45] <$DesertPenguin> It's just there to punish people that rush through

[2:32:57] <+Invlux> what about hitting the mimic doesn't activate it until about e our r
[2:33:01] <aimlesshealer> They work if you have to rely on sight to identify them. If you can just smack them all it's pointless, I agree
[2:33:01] <LuLz_Emissary> I forget about them because they're so spaced out
[2:33:01] <%Brother_Coduss> Paige: "it aint my fault"
[2:33:01] <DandyMackeroos> Mimics are only in the game because they were in D&D
[2:33:02] <+jiggy_snipe> it just punishes people who aren't cautious
[2:33:03] <MetalSlimeHunt> Mimics would be more successful if From had made the Bondfire and Ladder mimics that they conceptualized
[2:33:04] <%CommanderSqueaks> Mimics are meant to catch you sleeping.
[2:33:04] <@Calek> half the chests in DS3 are mimics
[2:33:05] <JonEWorldbeater> Ok, but here's the thing: people are stupid
[2:33:08] <Monkeyweed21> There are more mimics than chests in DS3
[2:33:08] <%SMuffinMan> Wait until DS3 LUL
[2:33:09] <Coystick> 3's is the best Mimic
[2:33:09] <+Chewygamer> yea it is hahahah
[2:33:10] <+Metballs> They're not a good design in Dark Souls, but the concept is good
[2:33:16] <+patriotrenegade> every chest in the Profaned Capital is a mimic
[2:33:17] <+jiggy_snipe> in other games its just another random battle
[2:33:18] <Sedrelic> 3 its oops all mimics
[2:33:19] <Hydrapissed> 3 is all mimics awww yeh
[2:33:21] <Coystick> Paige Souls
[2:33:22] <+cdrom321> 3's first chest is a mimic.
[2:33:24] <jorniev> mimics should turn into things other than chests, like pots and shelves
[2:33:25] <+marsantas> And it's also the trap building
[2:33:25] <TheEndlessRiver1> ds3 profaned capital and irithyll dungeon are just mimic cities
[2:33:28] <+ChestMimik> I'd put five and they're all next to each other
[2:33:29] <%dekkitout> Get a tatsumaki to the chest- at the first chest
[2:33:30] <+LensWander> randomize mimics
[2:33:30] <Melchior_the_Wise> I'd make every chest a mimic
[2:33:32] <JonEWorldbeater> 3
[2:33:33] <+FlameLoneWolf> Oops! All Mimics!
[2:33:36] <Melchior_the_Wise> except for 1
[2:33:38] <Sunstalker> Oh no, will she remember that tidbit when she plays dark souls 3 in 2024? vadeD
[2:33:38] <Jrockoni> mimics learn to tatsumaki its amazing
[2:33:46] <+cdrom321> Randomize mimics.
[2:33:47] <KaiserMario> Make them Mini-bosses
[2:33:48] <2fcd_twitch> Cause there's so much greed around
[2:33:48] <%CommanderSqueaks> Plague continues to piss on D&D.
[2:33:48] <LuLz_Emissary> I love them
[2:33:49] <+chiazamformerlymankeyfigh> The first chest in DS3 is a Mimic right?
[2:33:50] <RetributionP> mimics are good because Paige brain forgets they exist
[2:33:50] <shiny_prinny> just make mimics not 1 shot you and it's fair
[2:33:52] <$DesertPenguin> They're fun
[2:33:53] <$ODSTEvan147> Hey guys!
[2:33:56] <Melchior_the_Wise> Mimic Doors?
[2:33:57] <Mr_Mushie> make them fights rather than instant kills
[2:33:59] <+jiggy_snipe> randomize them and they further randomize on death
[2:33:59] <%SMuffinMan> @sunstalker nope lol
[2:33:59] <freelancebabymaker> plague wANTS to be bored
[2:34:00] <%xanerts> i feel every chest in 3 is a mimic
[2:34:02] <Tucker0603> no, put the first one early and the second super late
[2:34:04] <$DesertPenguin> If the piss you fof then they served their purpose
[2:34:06] <pilllowofbees> id just have one as a secret boss encounter
[2:34:09] <+FlameLoneWolf> They're pretty pointless and punishing for no real reason though.
[2:34:11] <LuLz_Emissary> Its such a goofy gacha that it works for me
[2:34:11] <+marsantas> They are great in dark souls because the gameplay theme is PAY ATTENTION
[2:34:13] <%Brother_Coduss> it's cause it's hard to slap tits on a box and think it's sexy, isnt it?
[2:34:14] <+Dayube> now talk about ladder mimics or door mimics
[2:34:16] <+deathman00789> what about mimics that run away with the loot inside it?
[2:34:16] <UltimateDomon> yeah that one got pat in the DS3 LP it was hilarious
[2:34:16] <+cdrom321> Mimic ladder. You climb into its mouth.
[2:34:16] <+StreamStopA> NOO
[2:34:17] <AlphaTauri> amazing
[2:34:17] <jorniev> dungeon meshi had a mimic in a shelf that was a giant crab
[2:34:20] <%EyeFarted> WHAT THE FUCK WOMAN
[2:34:21] <+luftraumm1> prey mimics are great
[2:34:21] <Jrockoni> did plague ever check out mortal shell?
[2:34:22] <Melchior_the_Wise> now we wait
[2:34:23] <+temporaryplaceholder> Oh shit I made a peach stream yaaayyyy
[2:34:28] <Luizabd> Dungeon Meshi's mimic are just crustacians and I like that a loot
[2:34:30] <%CommanderSqueaks> @FlameLoneWolf They're meant to catch people being careless, and in a game like Dark Souls, that's all about being careful and deliberate, it works fine.

[2:42:54] <+LiquidDinosaur> @TheYharnamTheorem Also the fact that the only reason the plot of this game is happening is "this guy right here is too tough for the Final Boss to handle so you need to do it for her"

[3:03:51] <+MoonObscure> YAY
[3:03:52] <+GabeSweetMan> I think my incredibly negative opinion of 2 is based on my only having experienced the base game and never trying Scholar's rebalance.

[3:04:17] <$NitronStreams> Paige beat ds2 without pat
[3:04:18] <lotharrio> It's why I always drop a sign at the entrance to an area and try to explore while helping a person.
[3:04:18] <%waltzqueen> YAY
[3:04:20] <%Jack_of_No_Trades> Oh cool a raid
[3:04:20] <+OwlLightningMage> No debate. Plague is right
[3:04:21] <+TopTieramisu> they should give souls combat quartercircle motions
[3:04:28] <MyNameIsRasus> A raid
[3:04:28] <%SMuffinMan> yay!
[3:04:30] <Kally_D> Perfect Dark - Counter Operative
[3:04:32] <wantedsafe471> Dark Souls 2 Banished
[3:04:33] <%CommanderSqueaks> That'd require so much extra work.
[3:04:36] <heartlesshealer> You can tell Pat that you beat Dark Souls Two
[3:04:37] <+yargne> i would like seperate severs, for for people fine with invasions and one for people who dont want them
[3:04:38] <%SMuffinMan> Thanks for the raid, miabyte!
[3:04:38] <+GabeSweetMan> The enemies have their attacks MAPPED to buttons.
[3:04:39] <LoneFonte> now I get the joke name LUL
[3:04:40] <+OwlLightningMage> Dark Souls PvP sucks. It needs to be something else
[3:04:40] <+Invlux> Oh so like Crawl
[3:04:42] <Kalcom> so like resident evil
[3:04:47] <+GabeSweetMan> So it would definitely work.
[3:04:49] <miabyte> :D
[3:04:50] <Pookiedaexzile> Plague is wrong, and that would ruin the fighting game that is invasion
[3:04:51] <Carnadan> isn't that basically mindjack?
[3:04:51] <zamzoph> Dark Souls 4 Dead
[3:04:55] <+JenovasPuppet> @heartlesshealer lol
[3:04:56] <+LiquidDinosaur> @GabeSweetMan is there a mod tht lets you just play as enemies, like all the time
[3:04:57] <BinaryBetrayer> Cinders has items that let invaders take the form of monsters but that's about it.
[3:05:01] <Phob05> Dead 4 Souls
[3:05:03] <%CommanderSqueaks> Sparkle is FINE
[3:05:06] <+NWR_James> Pat wont rewatch the stream so he wont check that she beat Dark Souls Two
[3:05:06] <%CommanderSqueaks> Go say hi to sparkle
[3:05:07] <Melchior_the_Wise> Go find out PAIGE
[3:05:07] <Mr_Mushie> just look
[3:05:10] <%EyeFarted> ENEMIES
[3:05:11] <%Lunarhawk> funzone here we are
[3:05:13] <%Lunarhawk> the easy zone
[3:05:13] <Monkeyweed21> Use a torch to see what they are
[3:05:13] <+TopTieramisu> souls pvp is fine. but pvp etiquette is dumb and should be disrespected
[3:05:15] <+Invlux> Plague have you played Crawl?
[3:05:16] <indigo_automaton> Or just have balanced pvp? lol
[3:05:21] <+OwlLightningMage> DS PvP as it stands now is just a shitty fighting game
[3:05:24] <Owkono> Avoid the noid
[3:05:26] <%velemi> sparkles mean they won't aggro until you get really close
[3:05:30] <@SoFarFetched> Yeah the NPC coming up explains it I believe.
[3:05:32] <%CommanderSqueaks> DS PVP would be so much better if it just didn't have shit netcode
[3:05:33] <Aleate> Actual nice reaction there Paige!
[3:05:34] <%xanerts> sparkle keeps the enemys calm
[3:05:34] <TheArrow_> i remember getting invaded a shitload amount of times trying to get through this area
[3:05:37] <%studleydoorite> there are bad men lurking in chat
[3:05:37] <+GabeSweetMan> @LiquidDinosaur I dunno about all the time but I know modders have done it and found that the way they created the AI was assigning specific attacks to button inputs.
[3:05:38] <%SMuffinMan> SPARKLES
[3:05:38] <+TopTieramisu> souls pvp will forever be janked when the combat is designed as is
[3:05:39] <+StreamStopA> well if you talked to the lady in the cage she would have told you.

[3:08:19] <Zombrocom> It's not really important

[3:25:46] <%CommanderSqueaks> Well, not made.
[3:25:52] <+GabeSweetMan> 80% of your brain power is going to conversation leaving only 20% of your attention span to autopilot the game.
