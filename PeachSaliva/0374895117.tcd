[0:08:10] <+connos_livereview> this track is kinda jojo ish
[0:08:10] <sykehm> Are we going to have Truck Fight tonight?
[0:08:15] <$FrostMass22> Muffins that have frosting are called cupcakes
[0:08:18] <%theslippybrit> lets lynchthat short bitch to show that violence and prejudice is wrong
[0:08:20] <Parapattern> A girl!? And she leaks gamer goo from her feet?!
[0:08:20] <%rumtumtugnutz> Like it got super out of hand.
[0:08:21] <$bootysteve> Everyday I shoot my goo, every day I shoot my goo, every day I every day I every day I shoot my goo

[0:08:24] <%rumtumtugnutz> But holy shit
[0:08:25] <$ozzyzak> this track kind of reminds me of seltzers theme in FF3
[0:08:27] <DauntlessBran> Guys cakes are muffins!
[0:08:27] <@mothmandraws> I made it
[0:08:28] <sykehm> I was only half paying attention to it, I was out today and saw a bit on twitter
[0:08:33] <%theslippybrit> everyone expects paige goo
[0:08:33] <Thirtine> muffins are quckbreads actually, THEYRE BOTH WRONG

[0:08:44] <+Blargimazombie> Muffins are Trucks guy I know what cars are
[0:08:44] <sykehm> What's the argument? What kind of cars are trucks?
[0:08:44] <$waltzqueen> @Thirtine is right
[0:08:45] <%MightyMaxT> Waffles are better than Jeeps but not as good as Trucks, which are cakes
[0:08:47] <$bootysteve> This is an undertale track right?
[0:08:47] <lewdskeletor13> Abort Chat NotLikeThis
[0:08:48] <Tevvy> you have to be on the tracks in the first place to derail
[0:08:48] <%rumtumtugnutz> Muffins are jerks.

[0:09:14] <$bootysteve> I heard they're adding goo as a mechanic
[0:09:15] <Thirtine> @waltzqueen its funnier that everyone is wrong here
[0:09:20] <$nademonkey1100> @GohanEgret thank you :D
[0:09:21] <%MightyMaxT> Its the Dummy and Napstablook
[0:09:21] <ArcticAsylum> Jeeps are a sandwich
[0:09:22] <$Mendin> 3
[0:09:24] <+Blargimazombie> It's Dummy
[0:09:24] <GohanEgret> :)
[0:09:25] <%2Metronomes> Its the dummy fight, not spider dance
[0:09:25] <Ya_boi_wally > if it has 4 wheels and STANKY suspension, then it's a truck
[0:09:28] <+ceaselessdiplomacy> WOW I CAUGHT A STREAM ON TIME
[0:09:29] <VRNK> oh wait im dumb
[0:09:30] <astrojunk13> BegWan BegWan BegWan
[0:09:34] <%rumtumtugnutz> What kind of sandwich?
[0:09:37] <%theslippybrit> paige needs goo badly
[0:09:38] <+polysyllabist> Paige can be a big and strong Master Facts shooter too though
[0:09:38] <%GeneralSCPatton> @tridentberryburst Oh yeah? What about that time Rikido Sato baked a chiffon cake but hadn't iced it yet? What was it at that point in time? A non-cake?
[0:09:38] <GohanEgret> I can't believe a toyota corolla is a truck Kappa
[0:09:40] <%rumtumtugnutz> I like grinders.
[0:09:42] <$FrostMass22> Is an occupied car technically a sandwich?
[0:09:49] <$samuraifriend> yes
[0:09:49] <$Brother_Coduss> In all fairness, Jeep HAS made trucks before, but not ALL jeeps are trucks
[0:09:51] <$ozzyzak> does Paige still wait like 45 minutes into the stream to play the game?
[0:09:52] <$bootysteve> You gotta get the right perks to remove your goo buff faster
[0:09:54] <lewdskeletor13> Is ketchup a shake?
[0:09:59] <Liwyn> SourPls
[0:10:00] <+Blargimazombie> I can't believe Pat kicked Trucks out of the FC
[0:10:00] <saint_george> WHO's TALKING?!?!
[0:10:01] <%rumtumtugnutz> I think it might be a ravioli
[0:10:01] <sectorclaus> @FrostMass22 Its more like a burrito
[0:10:02] <%MightyMaxT> An occupied car is more like a twinkie
[0:10:02] <%AncelDeLambert> loops
[0:10:05] <VRNK> is a jeep a convertible?
[0:10:06] <%galaxyswirl> YEYEYEYEYEYYE
[0:10:06] <+TridentBerryBurst> @GeneralSCPatton It was an incomplete cake

[0:57:22] <Fruitywhompus> not with that attitude
[0:57:25] <corybantic> u can go thru the hatch if youre last alive
[0:57:26] <Knijnen66> swish swish bish
[0:57:30] <$TIME_PUNCHER> @commanderclaw Bikini sweaters tho
[0:57:31] <+PeaceCentennial> so the best strategy in this game is "get two generators and then wait for literally everyone else to die so you can escape out the hatch"
[0:57:32] <+MisterTylerrr> what sense does it make that she can't heal herself while hidden in the closet?
[0:57:33] <+SulfurousAcid> don't give up bitch feenSmug
[0:57:34] <+Sir_Gawain_Lotsson> Super Bowl was a DISASTER, cutting to a "LITERALLY WHO" Mumble Rapper after teasing a tribute "Sweet Sweet Victory" for Stephen Hillenburg
[0:57:34] <%king_wragles> @PeachSaliva mid your blood pool
[0:57:36] <$ooblagis> Hide, and don't leave
[0:57:37] <ebonifragaria> Scary D:
[0:57:38] <+MagickBurritoh> she's doing better than I'd imagine
[0:57:42] <%theslippybrit> level up TOXIC SWISH
[0:57:43] <%Remery_> what is this closet gameplay?
[0:57:43] <$connos_livereview> MUSIC
[0:57:44] <thelonechris> Just live in the closet
[0:57:46] <Poop_Feast> in, out, in, out
[0:57:49] <GeneralHysterics> Can you hide indefinitely?
[0:57:49] <tacostarvedbeast> shes above u
[0:57:49] <+ahegotrigger> shes above you
[0:57:50] <Geno4344> is this outlast
[0:57:50] <Krovopiytsa> HIDE FOREVER
[0:57:52] <%RafflesiaA> Maybe right above you
[0:57:52] <GeneralHysterics> Is there a timer?
[0:57:56] <AFlyingTaco1> Is Amanda the killer's name?
[0:58:01] <CerberusDriver> Can someone tell me if this is reportable or not?
[0:58:02] <+IronPickle> try not to die
[0:58:03] <+GlewmanIII> yeah
[0:58:06] <Krovopiytsa> The Pig I think
[0:58:08] <%ElenaManetta> You can just run up to her!
[0:58:10] <%Terrabyte_The_Terrible> its super reportable
[0:58:10] <+ahegotrigger> Amanda is the pigs name
[0:58:10] <+GlewmanIII> it's amanda from saw @AFlyingTaco1
[0:58:11] <+SpamKingRathalos> Isn't there like a third guy?
[0:58:13] <$Corporate_Redeemer> Paige should play as Dwight with how much she's hiding in closets
[0:58:14] <$waltzqueen> @AFlyingTaco1 yes it's the Pig aka Amanda from Saw
[0:58:15] <%theslippybrit> shes above you, like youre on this level, and amandas totally up on this level
[0:58:16] <Pinesolbb> it says Swish because it's a joke in the community that if you pull yourself off a hook it looks like you're taking a basketball shot
[0:58:17] <%king_wragles> @CerberusDriver it should be, but I dunno
[0:58:21] <%Remery_> @GeneralHysterics nah hide, for too long and crows circle above your head
[0:58:23] <+SulfurousAcid> get da generator
[0:58:26] <$connos_livereview> just post GG EZ and leave the game
[0:58:26] <+BorinCorran> @AFlyingTaco1 Yeah, that's who she is. Amanda from Saw. She used to be a drug addict.
[0:58:27] <Pinesolbb> many people scream KOBE when they do it
[0:58:30] <CerberusDriver> I mean if you're helping the killer, thats bullshit
[0:58:35] <benjiFG> When are they gonna add Micolash, Host of the Nightmare?
[0:58:36] <%king_wragles> it is
[0:58:38] <GeneralHysterics> Dank
[0:58:39] <CerberusDriver> theyre probably in discord or something
[0:58:41] <Hanbei1708> there's no time(r)
[0:58:43] <+PeaceCentennial> oh is Paige the obsession too?
[0:58:44] <BakedPretzels> oh rad its paige
[0:58:47] <+PeaceCentennial> wait no
[0:58:49] <+PeaceCentennial> that guy is
[0:58:49] <AFlyingTaco1> Cool, thanks guys. It's been a LONG time since I watched any of those movies.
[0:58:50] <@mothmandraws> the survivors must have great leg muscles if they can squat walk that much
[0:58:50] <+Sir_Gawain_Lotsson> Micolash would be a legit good addition to this game
[0:58:51] <$ooblagis> Hide in a closet and read donations, they want to ruin the game, then let it be ruined
[0:58:55] <mercado94> is she?
[0:58:56] <PSI_Guy95> WE DO IT
[0:58:57] <LVDoomien> This is Freddys map yeah?
[0:59:03] <$FrostMass22> Who could they add? the killer from Scream?
[0:59:04] <+ahegotrigger> nice
[0:59:04] <Geno4344> how would Micolash work? He runs around and NPC skeletons kill the survivors for you?
[0:59:06] <ScreamingMeat> What does lanturn do?
[0:59:07] <takokasa> humanity restored rooHappy
[0:59:09] <+SulfurousAcid> the JESUS?
[0:59:10] <+Roundelay11> All I want for christmas is to see paige get big spooked
[0:59:10] <WanderingFlame7> WHATS HAPPENING
[0:59:10] <%theslippybrit> boo! where's the evil dead?
[0:59:10] <+SpamKingRathalos> Back in the asshoole you go
[0:59:11] <Smaenus> The power of god and anime
[0:59:12] <+runegod20> this is the freddy map, yeah
[0:59:13] <hntronium> BEES
[0:59:13] <+skizzuto> lanterns are the heart's true essence
[0:59:13] <$connos_livereview> the afterGLOW

[0:59:13] <thelonechris> Sora, Donald, Goofy
[0:59:14] <foreverN2dust> what does the "kingdom hearts" do?
[0:59:14] <mercado94> KINGDOM HEARTS IS LIGHT
[0:59:14] <%Remery_> Now she has mustard fairies
[0:59:15] <GeneralHysterics> SURROUNDED BY DARKNESS, BUT YOU HAVE THE LIGHT WITHIN YOU
[0:59:16] <%Keyd00d> kingdom hearts FeelsBadMan

[0:59:17] <studleydoorite> when are they gonna add Nyarlathotep the crawling Chaos
[0:59:18] <$Corporate_Redeemer> FILL YOUR DARK SOUL WITH LIGHT
[0:59:20] <LiquidMathew> not dying a bunch?
[0:59:20] <tacostarvedbeast> i always figured paige would serve the darkness, shes def norted
[0:59:20] <RantingRavager> Fuck that, Killer from Scary Movie
[0:59:20] <+UnderpaidBob> you're the biggest nobody of them all
[0:59:21] <Mr_Strut> You gotta fight the darkness Paige
[0:59:21] <CerberusDriver> paige probably understands kingdom hearts better than pat and woolie combined
[0:59:21] <devanmuse> Something about phones
[0:59:21] <%RafflesiaA> Gimmick FONE
[0:59:22] <+badchoice5> Kingdom Hearts 3 is pretty good
[0:59:22] <GeneralHysterics> ROXASSSSSS
[0:59:23] <notyouraveragevulva> More than one player is the killer
[0:59:23] <+SulfurousAcid> DARKNESS SUBMIT
[0:59:23] <WanderingFlame7> WHOS TALKING
[0:59:24] <arcaderabbit48> Phone calls

[0:59:25] <$waltzqueen> WEREWOLF KILLER WHEN
[0:59:25] <lewdskeletor13> GAWRSH SORA
[0:59:26] <%theslippybrit> there's too of him, one hides in a closet
[0:59:26] <AlchemiBeast> hs gimmick is that there is 2 killers
[0:59:26] <+maxamillion629> I won’t
[0:59:28] <Clammy_chan> the scream killer would be bad twists
[0:59:28] <@PinkieTheEerie> we already TALKED about what it would be
[0:59:28] <Hanbei1708> he's two players
[0:59:30] <+FoolsArcade> his gimmick would be desguised as survivor
[0:59:30] <Fluxraw> going "WHAZZUUUUUUP"
[0:59:30] <TikanZK> hot
[0:59:31] <%GarbageNirvana> He'd copy other killers
[0:59:31] <%theslippybrit> *two
[0:59:32] <alrobot2014> all ya gotta do is let your heart be your guiding kye
[0:59:32] <+PenmanLupine> it would have to be 2 players
[0:59:32] <Knijnen66> creepy phone calls?
[0:59:32] <+SulfurousAcid> DARKNESS SUBMIT DARKNESS SUBMIT
[0:59:32] <$nademonkey1100> calls people and makes a phone ring on the players
[0:59:33] <+idioteque___> so is legion
[0:59:34] <$spire6> Simple and clean is the way that Peach is
[0:59:34] <%Remery_> And muscular :)
[0:59:34] <$Corporate_Redeemer> He would call your phone and show your location
[0:59:35] <Aydarkzero> his power would be the GUN Kappa
[0:59:35] <+SpamKingRathalos> MR.X for dead by daylight
[0:59:35] <ArtThouBored> Bad references
[0:59:35] <%ElenaManetta> The killer from Scary Movie.
[0:59:36] <+maxamillion629> He’s actually a survivor
[0:59:36] <Vakojin> The Candyman would be cool.
[0:59:37] <Krovopiytsa> LIGHT ON THE INSIDE
[0:59:38] <rytisone> "I'm gonna gut you like a fish"
[0:59:38] <PSI_Guy95> WHAZUUUP
[0:59:39] <@mothmandraws> Im still sad that the latest one couldnt pretend to be one of the survivors like the trailer suggested
[0:59:39] <+PeaceCentennial> @ooblagis nah you can't stay in the closet for too long. Crows start flying around you if you hide in one spot
[0:59:40] <$Punisher7771> @PlagueOfGripes heres my question why is amanda in this game amanda although she was one of cramers aprintices she failed also a crackhead why dose she have these ability
[0:59:41] <LVDoomien> @PeachSaliva the killer from Scream was a fake leak a while ago that everyone believed
[0:59:41] <%Djinnazz> Pinhead would be nice.
[0:59:41] <+runegod20> the trapper is a normal person too, most of them are too
[0:59:41] <+Blargimazombie> Phones
[0:59:42] <%LupaTheWolf> indeed, when are they gonna add Nyaruko-san
[0:59:43] <$connos_livereview> KINGDOM HEARTS 3 SUCKS CHEESE OFF THE FLOOR
[0:59:45] <+IronPickle> he could like scream real loud and shit
[0:59:46] <King_Krimzon> Summon Shaggy
[0:59:48] <@PlagueOfGripes> I would marry Huntress
[0:59:48] <+rootdootmcscoot> pig is just a normal person
[0:59:48] <AFlyingTaco1> Hey Pat are you reading chat you fuck? If so, how excited are you about KH3, since you love that series so much?
[0:59:49] <$ooblagis> Ah, fug
[0:59:49] <+LeroyOctopus> maybe ghostface could break the fourth wall somehow
[0:59:49] <anar_bael> THE DARKNESS SORA
[0:59:50] <+donpatrondx> chucky
[0:59:51] <@mothmandraws> put mothman in
[0:59:51] <+SpamKingRathalos> SHAGGY
[0:59:52] <%superc37> fuck scream, I want the killer from scary movie
[0:59:52] <$daveronald> same guy who played shaggy
[0:59:52] <suikudo> Mr X for dead by daylight!
[0:59:52] <Pinesolbb> well in every scream movie the twist is that it's two people dressed as ghost face so it looks like they both have an alibi
[0:59:53] <studleydoorite> when Slaanesh?
[0:59:53] <+UnderpaidBob> what about the bye bye man
[0:59:53] <$Punisher7771> pat amanda is human'
[0:59:53] <%theslippybrit> NOT THE BEEES!
[0:59:54] <$FrostMass22> Pinhead?
[0:59:55] <Louie_Salmon> Are you gonna talk about Sully's Door combo on the podcast?
[0:59:55] <+MagickBurritoh> they can find you when traitor is on the hook
[0:59:56] <+lethallunacyx> how about candy man
[0:59:59] <+DK_Rance> shaggy blanco
[1:00:00] <+Story_Ark> MR X
[1:00:00] <CrypticMochi> Those Pixar worlds are great
[1:00:00] <LiquidMathew> Mr X new Killer
[1:00:01] <terminallyCapriciousz> PENNYWISE ISN'T ONLY A CLOWN
[1:00:01] <Coystick> MR X's gimmick is he Punches Y O U
[1:00:02] <Knijnen66> actual pennywise might be cool
[1:00:02] <%mothmanfanboy> Remember the time this one guy held a hatch standoff with a Claudette for FOUR STRAIGHT HOURS, because I remember that
[1:00:02] <tealwolf26> beeeeeeees
[1:00:02] <$ooblagis> Have IT, just never have the clown form
[1:00:03] <EASrake> What about It Follows
[1:00:03] <AMajorTom> Spoilers for Scream the movie --- thanks guys
[1:00:06] <$Corporate_Redeemer> He would show your location by calling survivor's phones
[1:00:06] <+king_of_beggars> @PeachSaliva Maniac Cop
[1:00:06] <DannyMcgee> So this is just like horror smash bros?
[1:00:07] <%GarbageNirvana> Still wanna see what they'd do with Chucky
[1:00:09] <+PeaceCentennial> Mr.X punches the fuck out of you
[1:00:10] <+ahegotrigger> I hope they get a big fucking spider
[1:00:10] <+SpamKingRathalos> MR.X would be legit though
[1:00:10] <%ElenaManetta> They could just do an IT skin.
[1:00:11] <%theslippybrit> OH GOD! the beeeeez
[1:00:11] <%Remery_> put a mothman in some creature, tired of humanoid killers
[1:00:12] <Vakojin> Since a new Candyman movie is in the making, perhaps ?
[1:00:13] <thelonechris> We need an alien
[1:00:14] <$connos_livereview> shaggy verde transformed
[1:00:15] <+VicWright> He calls survivors and can track them by the ringing
[1:00:15] <+GlewmanIII> Negan as a new killer?
[1:00:19] <%Terrabyte_The_Terrible> Like if they went for actual monsters, the Thing would be a great one too but I think it'd work like Legion
[1:00:20] <foreverN2dust> just add It as an echo killer
[1:00:20] <+SulfurousAcid> having an orgy
[1:00:21] <+PeaceCentennial> THE ROCK
[1:00:22] <PhantomMaskJr> Tall women klinkGasm
[1:00:23] <%ElenaManetta> Unless people would hate that, I don't know how the DbD community reacts to stuff like that.
[1:00:25] <Tucker0603> I'll admit...the Hunteress kinda gives me an erection....
[1:00:25] <$Corporate_Redeemer> SHAGGY AS A KILLER
[1:00:25] <tealwolf26> @dannymcgee absolutely
[1:00:26] <$TIME_PUNCHER> What about Leprechaun
[1:00:26] <+PeaceCentennial> THAT ROCK IS MADE FOR JUKING
[1:00:27] <Talyndemon> Tim Curry "IT"? With that one laugh?
[1:00:28] <Thirtine> Babadook killer?
[1:00:29] <+idioteque___> pyramid head would be sick, but idk what they'd do with him.
[1:00:30] <+king_of_beggars> Maniac Cop!
[1:00:31] <arcaderabbit48> I feel like IT wouldn't be a playable character, msotly because IT would be too busy sexing up the Entity. Like a spidery match made in hell
[1:00:31] <$FrostMass22> Could they do Chucky when he's Pat-height?
[1:00:31] <$Punisher7771> christene?
[1:00:32] <+UnderpaidBob> Kazuya as the next killer
[1:00:32] <zerocruz> Put Goku
[1:00:33] <+ABadIdea> I actually mentioned having Negan as a killer in one of my videos doodBenny
[1:00:33] <%Skeletorexplains> What about Jeepers Creepers?
[1:00:34] <Krovopiytsa> The Thing pretends to be a survivor?
[1:00:36] <+BorinCorran> @AMajorTom Don't worry, it's only one guy in Scream 3. But Scream 3 is shit so...
[1:00:38] <%Terrabyte_The_Terrible> Yeah
[1:00:40] <GeneralHysterics> Shaggy as a killer wouldn't be fair
[1:00:40] <%Gogogolem> Does that sweater say Jewish?
[1:00:40] <lewdskeletor13> Pennywise The Dancing Clown
[1:00:41] <%DesertPenguin09> @peachsaliva did you hear about the Scary Stories To Tell In The Dark movie this summer?
[1:00:42] <+mechslayer71> Been playing RE 1 remake while I wait to get money for 2. Really liking it, camera angles were jank at first but I got used to it @peachsaliva
[1:00:42] <Geno4344> Is Paige the Ashen One?
[1:00:43] <tacostarvedbeast> your super saiyan aura wont betray you
[1:00:46] <GeneralHysterics> no one would get away
[1:00:47] <Knijnen66> anything with shape shifting would make an interesting killer
[1:00:49] <+ThatGuyfromMars> no, swish @Gogogolem
[1:00:49] <iamnolionheart> do Ghostface like I thought Legion was going to do, start out with 5 survivors and one is the killer
[1:00:49] <arcaderabbit48> @Punisher7771 The Steven King car?
[1:00:51] <Mikers29> Missingno should be the Creepypasta killer
[1:00:51] <GeneralHysterics> HE'D KILL THE PLAYERS OF THE GAME
[1:00:51] <%ElenaManetta> Paige is doing good for being the only one alive vs. a killer siding with a traitor.
[1:00:54] <$spire6> Humanity restored
[1:00:56] <AFlyingTaco1> Maybe that guy saw the other two were being assholes and just quit?
[1:00:57] <Clammy_chan> give me my mothman killer who flies
[1:01:00] <tealwolf26> christine would be great! ghost cars dude!
[1:01:01] <$connos_livereview> shaggy cant be in any of these games realistically becuase he is too powerfull
[1:01:02] <+ABadIdea> @PeachSaliva Mr. X as a Killer doodSprinkle
[1:01:05] <+SpamKingRathalos> FUCK
[1:01:05] <$Punisher7771> @arcaderabbit48 yes
[1:01:06] <$TIME_PUNCHER> @PeachSaliva Leprechaun, Critters and Tremors would be reeeeeal interesting

[1:01:15] <%ElenaManetta> You can FEEL it
[1:01:16] <LiquidMathew> I hope she betrays you again
[1:01:16] <%theslippybrit> if a survivor dies leatherface should wear their face on his face

[1:01:28] <+PeaceCentennial> LEAVE EM
[1:01:29] <arcaderabbit48> @connos_livereview Shaggy being put in would end the game entirely, The Entity would not be able to handle him
[1:01:29] <tealwolf26> leave them for bread
[1:01:29] <Geno4344> oh lawd she comin
[1:01:30] <+SpamKingRathalos> FLEE

[1:01:36] <Krovopiytsa> TRAITOR
[1:01:36] <+PeaceCentennial> THEY DON'T DESERVE YOUR KINDNESS
[1:01:36] <AFlyingTaco1> NO BAD PAIGE
[1:01:37] <Fruitywhompus> paige is a better person than me
[1:01:43] <ArtThouBored> Its a trap
[1:01:43] <%king_wragles> She got points for it tho
[1:01:43] <+maxamillion629> collusion
[1:01:44] <+PeaceCentennial> oh she's gonna be skulking by the entrance
[1:01:47] <Krovopiytsa> ITS A TRAP
[1:01:49] <+PeaceCentennial> easily
[1:01:50] <Thirtine> NO QUARTER FOR TRAITORS
[1:01:51] <$Punisher7771> huh what about anyone from the hills have eyes?
[1:01:52] <%theslippybrit> just kill the pig just do it
[1:01:53] <%SuichiTanaka> Paige may as well get as many points as she can
[1:01:53] <alexandrecau> KILL EM ALL PAIGE
[1:01:54] <@mothmandraws> your allies are the true killers
[1:01:58] <+SpamKingRathalos> TURN THE OTHER CHEEK
[1:02:02] <+ahegotrigger> lol
[1:02:04] <$connos_livereview> claudette a pussy bitch
[1:02:08] <sileo_patronus> rip
[1:02:10] <%ElenaManetta> I'm on the edge of my seat for this match... I want Paige to beat these two fuckers
[1:02:10] <iamnolionheart> Chucky might be neat too
[1:02:12] <%Remery_> Scavenge for food, trash panda
[1:02:13] <%theslippybrit> leave claudette to jiren
[1:02:13] <tacostarvedbeast> paige is the brave and the bold
[1:02:13] <zerocruz> I don’t understand whats going on
[1:02:17] <GeneralHysterics> What if claudette is playing the long con? Pretending to be on the killer's side and then making it out alive?
[1:02:18] <arcaderabbit48> I feel like some sort of fishman or swamp creature would be good, but The Hag arguably fills that roll already
[1:02:19] <+GlewmanIII> you get bold just for being in the basement
[1:02:22] <+ahegotrigger> run out the exit now
[1:02:23] <iamnolionheart> YO OR THE THING

[1:39:34] <@commanderclaw> Paige, you might be haunted
[1:39:34] <lewdskeletor13> That’s spooky
[1:39:34] <RileyOMalley> its an infectious tune
[1:39:35] <nutimik> what do you actually hear?
[1:39:35] <$Dutchpotato> Paige is insane
[1:39:35] <%mercado94> ???
[1:39:36] <$connos_livereview> puntress
[1:39:36] <+D2_Synua> What does Paige even do for "work"?
[1:39:36] <Jontman42> No that's a crazy
[1:39:37] <%ElenaManetta> Anima's humming from Evil Within 2 was nice
[1:39:38] <+HostilePoundcakes> NotLikeThis NotLikeThis
[1:39:39] <Firesparks> paige is turning into the huntress
[1:39:41] <+PeaceCentennial> It's not actually hearing it
[1:39:42] <DrMoose7> she's going crazy
[1:39:43] <%nils_nilsson> That sounds like paranoid schizophrenia
[1:39:43] <+ThatGuyfromMars> is this like the tetris effect
[1:39:44] <Liwyn> oh no shes crazy
[1:39:46] <+CarlosEoM> you know what she means
[1:39:46] <%LupaTheWolf> you are being Hunted
[1:39:48] <suikudo> hmm
[1:39:49] <Prism_Wing> You think about the music?
[1:39:49] <%bloodypurpledog> That's called thinking Paige
[1:39:50] <%LupaTheWolf> RIP Paige
[1:39:50] <Tucker0603> @coppertucker changed it to Tucker? cool
[1:39:50] <AstroFalcon09> like a song you can't get out of your head
[1:39:50] <%Remery_> Can't wait until they introduce a killer who makes chewing noises the closer he gets to you xD
[1:39:54] <Zola390> paige, that is insanity talking. don't listen.
[1:39:54] <%ThePuddingDead> i get that whenever i have days off work and I wont stop hearing end credit themes from movies
[1:39:56] <ECRead> Paige is huntress. run Pat
[1:39:56] <lewdskeletor13> @elenamanetta Man Evil Within 3 when?
[1:39:57] <%king_wragles> Oh cool, you can reload hatchts
[1:39:59] <Prism_Wing> That's not crazy lol.
[1:40:01] <%ElenaManetta> YEAH WHEN
[1:40:05] <+ThatGuyfromMars> @Remery_ that would be the worst
[1:40:05] <%theslippybrit> drop the axe coward!
[1:40:07] <+PeaceCentennial> it's just your brain going "oh did that sorta sound like the thing that releases the scared pheromone ok do it now"
[1:40:09] <MrLittleSam> Just say it's stuck in your head.
[1:40:10] <+UnderpaidBob> @Remery_ The ASMR killer
[1:40:12] <tealwolf26> Mine are telling me to burn them all :)
[1:40:16] <ebonifragaria> Kill them all, Pat!
[1:40:18] <$DocMadfox> Playing this right now, forgot how fun playing Trapper was
[1:40:18] <+icy_swagmuffins> After I’m done playing huntress the lullaby is always stuck in my head
[1:40:21] <%AncelDeLambert> Huntress gets axes, yeah
[1:40:34] <+lethallunacyx> what else do you "hear"?
[1:40:37] <DoubleAgentSmith> Did Freddy ever get a buff?
[1:40:38] <%Remery_> @ThatGuyfromMars That's what I want though, I want to be annoyed not turned on
[1:40:39] <Tucker0603> @coppertucker @foolsarcade I've met maybe 5 Tucker's, and 3 were dogs
[1:40:43] <%nils_nilsson> that sounds kinda unfair
[1:40:47] <%theslippybrit> drop the axe and beat their shit
[1:40:47] <+SpamKingRathalos> Oh?
[1:40:50] <lewdskeletor13> What do the voices tell you to do Paige?
[1:40:52] <+PeaceCentennial> freddie is probably hard to buff
[1:41:00] <CopperTucker> @Tucker0603 @FoolsArcade I've never met another Tucker except online
[1:41:04] <%ThePuddingDead> yeah theyre fuckin with ya
[1:41:04] <InugamiTheHound> so who is the worst hunter now??
[1:41:04] <Fruitywhompus> yeah that probably needs some time
[1:41:06] <tj_timbs> oh boy the devs for this game
[1:41:06] <+FoolsArcade> @Tucker0603 @CopperTucker hahah I have met a couple different dogs taht were Tucker.
[1:41:07] <@mothmandraws> is katana ghost good
[1:41:09] <Rhinoprotoss> Is there a Peach Saliva bingo card?
[1:41:13] <@mothmandraws> I heard she had issues after launch
[1:41:17] <+SulfurousAcid> check da basement
[1:41:17] <$connos_livereview> freddy got fingered
[1:41:17] <%shinsaryn> To kill women.
[1:41:18] <%king_wragles> From what I've been seeing/reading, the only way to buff Freddy is to make him a different character lol
[1:41:20] <+FoolsArcade> and yeah I've only met one Tucker off-line @CopperTucker
[1:41:25] <%ThePuddingDead> there should be
[1:41:25] <%theslippybrit> give skelmo fries
[1:41:29] <hntronium> Yes there is
[1:41:30] <eco419> Oink
[1:41:30] <%krawtch> FREE SPACE - MCDONDOLS
[1:41:31] <+PeaceCentennial> Spirit is really good for this kind of situation
[1:41:32] <%JEiddew> @Rhinoprotoss Yes but it's kinda outdated
[1:41:34] <AmericanaRed> slammed
[1:41:36] <hntronium> ***
[1:41:36] <$ItsRatman> FREE SPACE: Mcdonalds
[1:41:39] <+SpamKingRathalos> JUKIN PAT
[1:41:41] <redsynod> madonols
[1:41:41] <tealwolf26> I just ordered WcDonals
[1:41:41] <+PeaceCentennial> because you can literally just teleport to the next generator
[1:41:42] <lewdskeletor13> There should be
[1:41:46] <AlexTheTree> all spaces are elmo
[1:41:46] <Prism_Wing> insert Randy Orton theme.
[1:41:50] <jebushermo> so ghost pepper burger when?
[1:41:51] <%theslippybrit> someone feed skelmo hes all bony
[1:41:53] <AmericanaRed> counter clock
[1:41:57] <ebonifragaria> Go backawards?
[1:42:01] <+Tokanova> free points
[1:42:01] <$ooblagis> DDouble back on one
[1:42:02] <$Corporate_Redeemer> The devs are actually super bias against killers. It took getting humiliated at a Korean interview for them to nerd flashlights and pallets from being right next to each other.
[1:42:03] <%Remery_> Especially when she's wearing that schoolgirl outfit
[1:42:05] <+SpamKingRathalos> CAUGHT
[1:42:05] <%theslippybrit> get eem
[1:42:05] <tj_timbs> the devs were asked what would be done about frustrating killer experiences, and one of them straight up said to try playing something else
[1:42:09] <hntronium> @InfamousPlanet has posted the Ruby Weapon Hour bingo card on twitter
[1:42:11] <tealwolf26> feed the baby! gotta love him!
[1:42:22] <%AncelDeLambert> LUL
[1:42:24] <CrimsonFox777> Civ 6
[1:42:24] <Ion_LaserX> Really?
[1:42:26] <+PeaceCentennial> I mean they aren't wrong????
[1:42:27] <%Remery_> HAHAHA
[1:42:27] <DesuDesuDokiDoki> LU
[1:42:31] <$DocMadfox> I mean, yeah
[1:42:31] <cerberuscarmine> yep
[1:42:32] <%ssjklyco> Yeah.
[1:42:32] <@mothmandraws> iirc the devs want the killers to be there to scare vs win
[1:42:33] <+SpamKingRathalos> Okay somethin else
[1:42:33] <$connos_livereview> works for me
[1:42:34] <lewdskeletor13> Jake from RE6
[1:42:36] <$Corporate_Redeemer> The devs are also SUPER BAD at playing killers
[1:42:36] <$DocMadfox> "git gud"
[1:42:37] <DoubleAgentSmith> The Devs said to go play Civ 6 LUL
[1:42:37] <SirSmudgey> The devs said "take a break, play civ 5 or something"
[1:42:39] <AmericanaRed> PLAY TO WIN
[1:42:39] <+PeaceCentennial> A lot of killer experiences mean the kit aint working for you
[1:42:40] <NiftyNox> 'just play a top tier character' Kappa
[1:42:41] <DesuDesuDokiDoki> ok ill play a different game LUL
[1:42:41] <%theslippybrit> just like pat the huntress must stop wat shes doing to clean
[1:42:42] <$connos_livereview> id jus play RE2
[1:42:43] <cerberuscarmine> "dont like it dont play"
[1:42:43] <%TheFilth> Lawbringer is S-tier
[1:42:44] <%AncelDeLambert> if it's "frustrating" you may be playing it wrong
[1:42:44] <CrimsonFox777> He meant to take a break every now and then and play Civ 6.
[1:42:46] <+SpamKingRathalos> TWO
[1:42:48] <takokasa> Jeff Jakerson
[1:42:49] <+Tormehnt> Hey Peach, Do you and Pat use any software for video editing for youtube, or do you just export straight from Twitch?
[1:42:54] <%AncelDeLambert> that's actually quite good advice
[1:42:54] <Liwyn> yall got phones dont you
[1:43:00] <+jjgamez64> It was the literal Game Director
[1:43:03] <%krawtch> but what about the victory i was guaranteed when i spent money
[1:43:04] <+Maids4lyfe> LUL
[1:43:04] <+jjgamez64> The big man
[1:43:08] <+jjgamez64> who said that
[1:43:12] <DoubleAgentSmith> The problem is the game is meant to be played with no communication between the survivors.
[1:43:14] <tealwolf26> "It just works" Kappa
[1:43:20] <+PeaceCentennial> Legion is my favorite so far.
[1:43:22] <%theslippybrit> going out raw
[1:43:23] <+PenmanLupine> sometimes devs really gotta just be code monkeys and not go anywhere near a mic/audience.
[1:43:25] <%JEiddew> RAW
[1:43:25] <$Corporate_Redeemer> The devs are also all Survivor Mains so that says a lot
[1:43:27] <+SpamKingRathalos> R A W
[1:43:27] <%ElenaManetta> Raw doggin' it
[1:43:27] <mayorrev> Do YuGuYs NoT hAvE PhOnEs??
[1:43:29] <Coystick> "It just works on your phones"
[1:43:29] <Tucker0603> @coppertucker @foolsarcade the other 2 tuckers were at my high school
[1:43:29] <@mothmandraws> I think they were trying to move rewards for killers more to playing the role vs killing
[1:43:31] <ninja777fanboy> love the spirit
[1:43:33] <+PeaceCentennial> just man, never have a chase with Legion
[1:43:34] <lewdskeletor13> What is that quote from?
[1:43:35] <%The_Lady_Alustriel> That Metro Dev's statement of "just install software" is pretty bad too
[1:43:37] <tj_timbs> it's apparently impossible to be a good killer at the higher levels
[1:43:37] <Dr00_PhD> you never finished the girl scout story
[1:43:41] <@mothmandraws> so killers scare vs kill
[1:43:41] <+Order_of_Mystery> Okay, so Anthem's Colossus is awful
[1:43:42] <jebushermo> @PeachSaliva is RE2 remake on the table of games to stream?
[1:43:51] <RantingRavager> @PeachSaliva have you considered hiring a video editor to cut up your videos into 30 min segments?
[1:43:51] <ebonifragaria> That sucks, 'cause if you try to balance for that the people who don't collude in discord get fucked
[1:43:51] <%JEiddew> are all killer games this boring
[1:43:57] <%theslippybrit> my colour is dumb i want blue name
[1:43:58] <%ElenaManetta> If this is one of those games where it's VERY easy to assume players will be in Discord groups, why not just include in-game chat?
[1:44:04] <@mothmandraws> nah they are just running him around
[1:44:05] <+FoolsArcade> @Tucker0603 @CopperTucker The only other Tucker I've met was one of my former customers Sons lol
[1:44:11] <+R0bobot> Where is ELMO
[1:44:16] <%theslippybrit> totally dead
[1:44:16] <thebiggestsharkdrake> Yay, I managed to actually catch one of these streams live!
[1:44:18] <The_Blumper> Did you watch the superb owl?
[1:44:19] <$Corporate_Redeemer> Jake used to be able to permanently break hooks at one point
[1:44:20] <%AncelDeLambert> they're going slow and methodical
[1:44:24] <+SpamKingRathalos> This one is being conducted by Black op survivors
[1:44:26] <+PeaceCentennial> no they're down to 1
[1:44:27] <DoubleAgentSmith> Rank Reset is also a pain because you'll have newbs with no perks going against stacked veterans PJSalt
[1:44:34] <%AncelDeLambert> NOW YA FUCKED UP
[1:44:34] <@StridentSong> @PeachSaliva We played a few games as survivor together. I think we only did like 2 games where I was the killer
[1:44:35] <%nils_nilsson> @elenamanetta that'd be too easy to include
[1:44:35] <$ooblagis> And Pat literally follows a pattern
[1:44:36] <+SpamKingRathalos> CAUGHT
[1:44:40] <ninja777fanboy> BloodTrail BibleThump
[1:44:47] <Cobalt_Bluesy> Can someone explain Legion’s gimmick? I’ve been hearing a lot of them.
[1:44:48] <%TheFilth> yeah I ran that strat back in the day, I was an asshole
[1:44:48] <%theslippybrit> but then they got him off
[1:44:54] <%king_wragles> I forget who was asking, but you can change your name color by clicking settings (the gear icon) and choose a different color by clicking your name
[1:44:56] <+PeaceCentennial> that generator is really close
[1:45:02] <%theslippybrit> thank you
[1:45:03] <lewdskeletor13> THE HOOKS IS OUT
[1:45:04] <+trnzero> guru
[1:45:09] <+SulfurousAcid> good boi strident
[1:45:10] <Bendawiz> he still can I think

[1:45:17] <Tomiko0> Stri-Sama~
[1:45:19] <%JEiddew> strident still keeps eos on sic though
[1:45:29] <Leodude> @PeachSaliva I may be late to this but have either of you tried Deathgarden? like this but with parkour.
[1:45:32] <smashthatboipucci> Someone just called me "pay to win killer" for playing leatherface
[1:45:33] <hntronium> senpaisei
[1:45:33] <redsynod> strident-dono
[1:45:34] <@commanderclaw> Also Shishou
[1:45:34] <+ThatGuyfromMars> couldn't get away
[1:45:40] <+Order_of_Mystery> hey Pat and Paige, what do you guys think about that Jade Empire thing? Think Bioware will live long enough to fuck it up again?
[1:45:40] <+Elky3> senpai chariOWO
[1:45:43] <Tucker0603> @coppertucker @foolsarcade Wait! I stand corrected, I met a little kid named Tucker when he and his parents came into the Army/Navy surplus store I work at over the summer.
[1:45:44] <+Freemsyy> uwu
[1:45:49] <%LupaTheWolf> senpai gives me flashbacks
[1:45:50] <cerberuscarmine> uwu
[1:45:51] <%Remery_> @smashthatboipucci oh he's pretty facerolly
[1:45:52] <+SpamKingRathalos> NO
[1:45:54] <+SpamKingRathalos> KILL THEM
[1:45:55] <eco419> Uwu
[1:46:00] <MONSTR_UwU> uwu
[1:46:01] <HalloweenHangover> Deathgarden died within two months of launch.
[1:46:01] <%superbabyjoker> cheer1000 How can I donate all my real money to Elmo?
[1:46:02] <tacostarvedbeast> Your sensepai
[1:46:05] <%ElenaManetta> Just like in real horror movies.
[1:46:05] <+PeaceCentennial> SNIPE EM
[1:46:06] <DoubleAgentSmith> Leatherface is so trolly with the stealth perk LUL
[1:46:12] <+SpamKingRathalos> LET NONE SURVIVOR
[1:46:14] <$Corporate_Redeemer> Deathgarden has only 1 person playing and it's literally a dev
[1:46:22] <oponomo2> hi Ruby! tell Pat i sent him a kiss. just watched his whole RE5 content with much joy!
[1:46:24] <Fruitywhompus> it really does seem like theyre in discord together
[1:46:28] <+AltunRes> Death Garden is made by the DBD devs. It sucked pretty badly.
[1:46:30] <$SweetCheeksTrap> Eyyyy!
[1:46:30] <Gwyndellyn> are you running NOED?
[1:46:33] <Pinesolbb> yeah Dead By Daylight has some of the most bizarre toxicity of any game I've ever played
[1:46:34] <cerberuscarmine> :D
[1:46:34] <Lupus_Fide> I love you pagie

[1:46:47] <%SergeantSov> I may have missed it in other streams but have y'all ever looked at Last Year: The nightmare?
[1:46:49] <thebiggestsharkdrake> Hi Peach, I'm the dude from the UK that mentioned all the stuff about heart attacks and massive hospital delays, I'm finally catching one of these live like I said I was hoping to do!
[1:46:49] <foreverN2dust> lockers
[1:46:55] <$renegadehatter> Pat should be on screen for this

[1:47:08] <+mrpsycho666> just Y E E T the ax at them
[1:47:11] <MONSTR_UwU> you guys recommend RE2 for big babies like myself?
[1:47:12] <+PeaceCentennial> the other one escaped
[1:47:19] <%JEiddew> cleverly wasting his axe, pat has lured them in to a false sense of security
[1:47:20] <Cobalt_Bluesy> Who is Pat playing and what do they do?
[1:47:25] <+SpamKingRathalos> run her down

[1:47:36] <$Corporate_Redeemer> Paige have you seen the screenshot of a Claudette hiding? It's literally impossible to see her and it sucks because the devs can't change her outfits because nobody would use them and can't change her skin tone for obvious reasons
[1:47:37] <DesuDesuDokiDoki> honey go down

[1:51:29] <@PinkieTheEerie> Wow
[1:51:30] <+PeaceCentennial> the best way to play survivor is fucking sacrifice the other 3 members of your team and get the hatch
[1:51:32] <@PinkieTheEerie> Thats legit
[1:51:35] <%AbnormalVoid> if you have a fire pit, and some marshallows, then you're campiing

[2:00:48] <AmericanaRed> I mean Woolie EVA 1 was nice
[2:00:51] <%mercado94> @PeachSaliva I tried to play Anthem and it almost broke my computer
[2:00:51] <%bbHighvalor> if ur an ea appologist, ur literally hitler
[2:00:52] <%TheFilth> Fallout 76 poisoned me
[2:00:52] <Cobaltor_252> no pat you just don't UNDERSTAND the game is supposed to feel clunky
[2:00:52] <$Corporate_Redeemer> ANTHEM is fine but also not fine.
[2:00:53] <$Fenrirlives> Pat why must you frustrate me like this
[2:00:53] <%alliedmastercompy> I got this game and most of the DLC for PS4 because my PC sucks, did I make a mistake?
[2:00:53] <+PeaceCentennial> GET YOUR FORTUNA STUFF NOW BECAUSE IT'LL BE DEAD NEXT MONTH
[2:00:53] <mannywatcha> EA can suck my dick
[2:00:53] <+UnderpaidBob> Woolie tried to play it too LUL
[2:00:56] <DesuDesuDokiDoki> >anthem
[2:00:57] <+BurncoatRapscallion> After being hyped for Anthem and downplaying the concerns during the VIP demo, I'm super disappointed after playing it
[2:00:58] <Laironx3> "I will drink Red Bull tomorrow to stay awake"
[2:00:58] <%The_Lady_Alustriel> Yeah Woolie knows he's gonna have to go in and defend his opinions tomorrow
[2:01:02] <%ThePuddingDead> EA doesnt NEED help when making stupid decisions
[2:01:02] <%Divryne> NEW FFXIV STUFF THOUGH.
[2:01:02] <Ion_LaserX> Why stan for EA?
[2:01:03] <$Fenlig> Bioware needs all the defence it can get
[2:01:06] <+MisterCrimson> I was kind of digging anthem until I found out the demo is a months old build that was the most recent stable build they had...the game comes out in 2 weeks, wtf
[2:01:09] <%salty_syd913> those crashes were the worst
[2:01:09] <CeeDee__> I wonder if Pat saw Woolie's clip of Anthem yet
[2:01:11] <Tucker0603> Pat, I'm actually like it, it ain't the best, but I find Collossus fun
[2:01:11] <%krawtch> some people also like getting farted on
[2:01:12] <%JEiddew> male viera
[2:01:13] <AmericanaRed> ANTHEM = LOADING SCREENS
[2:01:17] <%theslippybrit> get max level for mileena costume
[2:01:20] <Ion_LaserX> Bioware needs to cut the crap and make ME5
[2:01:22] <StooEsq> ig multimillion dollar EA
[2:01:24] <+PeaceCentennial> he was trying to escape
[2:01:31] <%krawtch> make Mass Effect 3
[2:01:33] <jimhalla> woah woah, did someone just say male viera?
[2:01:34] <+Order_of_Mystery> mass effect is dead
[2:01:35] <%krawtch> but like, good
[2:01:39] <@mothmandraws> the wierdest thing for me with anthem, was there was like no music
[2:01:40] <%theslippybrit> wheres my jade empire port for the future kids to learn
[2:01:40] <ebonifragaria> @Ion_LaserX If it's made by current Bioware, I'd rather have nothing

[2:01:46] <StooEsq> Big Multimillion Dollar EA needs their brands defended
[2:01:46] <+PeaceCentennial> Huntress is a solid character
[2:01:47] <lewdskeletor13> Mass Effect is dead, let it rest
[2:01:48] <DesuDesuDokiDoki> huntress is waifu
[2:01:53] <$AgentTexes> @PeachSaliva I don't know if you know this but you can also use lockers to avoid BBQ now.
[2:01:54] <$connos_livereview> Anthem is bad and if you like it you are bad
[2:02:00] <+MisterCrimson> @jimhalla yep, they'll be talking about males at Japan fanfest
[2:02:00] <Tucker0603> HUNTRESS is best girl
[2:02:03] <%theslippybrit> and also smell

[2:02:12] <+brickwall35> Huntress Lullaby is very good
[2:02:17] <+PeaceCentennial> my waifu is Susie from the Legion
[2:02:17] <+Demerson13> Huntress is super broken with a specific loadout

[2:02:34] <%theslippybrit> here
[2:02:38] <$Corporate_Redeemer> ANTHEM will be good in a year, just you watch
[2:02:38] <%Remery_> top tier killer waifu
[2:02:39] <+Order_of_Mystery> @connos_livereview I wanted to like playing as Colossus so much, but god its aggresively unfun
[2:02:40] <mannywatcha> Those guys get fucked propper
[2:02:42] <$connos_livereview> @AmericanaRed word for real
[2:02:42] <lewdskeletor13> A DMC 1 remake would be lit
[2:02:45] <DesuDesuDokiDoki> LUL
[2:02:49] <%MrBorisMakarov> LUL
[2:02:50] <+MisterCrimson> @jimhalla personally, I would be fine if they scrapped male Viera and just had male Bangaa playable
[2:02:51] <LifesNeverHumDrum> chinese new year generator

[2:02:54] <SGrim> Back in 5. Don't die.
[2:02:54] <+SpamKingRathalos> damn
[2:02:56] <+PeaceCentennial> I love how Legion is 4 different killers but it kinda sucks 2 of them are locked behind cash shop
[2:02:56] <%theslippybrit> paige go wait in the corner thats all your good for
[2:02:57] <%krawtch> they already remade DMC1 and it was bad
[2:02:58] <californaya> little spook became big spook
[2:03:01] <californaya> WHO'S SCREAMING
[2:03:02] <mannywatcha> Don't come up behind me like that boy!
[2:03:05] <+AmaniIsYourBoss> Oh hey Paige, glad your not Doritos anymore
[2:03:06] <+brickwall35> don't fuck up the gen then leave Paige, that's not nice
[2:03:07] <$connos_livereview> @lewdskeletor13 also word
[2:03:08] <AFlyingTaco1> HOnestly completely forgot that the Anthem beta was this weekend
[2:03:12] <mannywatcha> That scared me!
[2:03:12] <@mothmandraws> I think they should add Gremlins as a killer
[2:03:14] <Mr_Strut> COLLUSION
[2:03:14] <%theslippybrit> do you rike it?
[2:03:18] <+brickwall35> Beast of Pray is god awful
[2:03:18] <Parapattern> I'm reading the Wiki for The Huntress and that is some BADASS SHIT
[2:03:18] <$connos_livereview> and dino crisis 1 and 2
[2:03:26] <$Corporate_Redeemer> FIRE UP IS OP
[2:03:28] <BakedPretzels> i just watched a parrakeet sing another one bites the duat hily shit
[2:03:29] <jimhalla> @MisterCrimson I hear that, Bangaa are underutilised, but I'm still weirdly interested to see what male viera are like
[2:03:38] <%theslippybrit> bitch cant sing
[2:03:43] <Tucker0603> no, it's good
[2:03:44] <+brickwall35> Huntress Lullaby is very good, especially at low levels
[2:03:47] <SirSmudgey> all of huntresses perks suck
[2:03:48] <Pinesolbb> @PeachSaliva the only huntress perk that's any good is Huntress' Lullaby, and that's only because you can stack it with Overcharge to make the last 3 generators practically impossible to do
[2:03:52] <+king_of_beggars> I can't wait to see what Bethesda fucks up between now and the podcast.
[2:03:56] <mannywatcha> Bitch can sing, jut not the best.
[2:03:56] <$FrostMass22> Could a non-human like Shakma be a killer?
[2:03:58] <+XzileGaming> @mothmandraws which gremlin, maybe the female gremlin, or perhaps scientist gremlin
[2:04:01] <arcaderabbit48> I really hope if we do get male Viera, they're actual people. And not just Bunny Potatos

[2:13:56] <lewdskeletor13> “My OC is the strongest”-Pat
[2:13:57] <%krawtch> make it work for lockers too then
[2:13:58] <Parapattern> Pat's killer could be called Pitter-Patter
[2:14:00] <ebonifragaria> Pat the killer would jump and bite your face off

[2:31:22] <DuoScratch> he slows down while you rev
[2:31:22] <Arclight2879> Lol get hera pair of ugly boots like yours.
[2:31:25] <%Ell1ot> you should write a fanfic and do fan art of the fanfic
[2:31:26] <%SuichiTanaka> These survivors are such ASSHOLES
[2:31:27] <+d00msdaydan> sounds like a lot of stuff wouldn't work so you should just get her a bad dragon dildo
[2:31:29] <%theslippybrit> send her a turd
[2:31:31] <%ceaselessdiplomacy> get her a bralette. I love it when my friends get me bralettes
[2:31:32] <%sleepy_coffee> @PeachSaliva why not go do a shoping with her?

[2:32:06] <RileyOMalley> everybody could use some boob art
[2:32:07] <%ElenaManetta> Why is a hammer so much more brutal than an axe
[2:32:07] <+PeaceCentennial> NO
