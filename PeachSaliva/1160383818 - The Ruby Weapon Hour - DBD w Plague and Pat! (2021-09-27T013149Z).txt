[0:44:26] <%TeepPhoenix> If you know his kit
[0:44:32] <biglomix> Why are there lgbt flags, this feels like a hate crime
[0:44:40] <spamspaz> i've only seen Elm Street 1 and 2, are the others worth checking?
[0:44:40] <@SoFarFetched> because it was for pride month
[0:44:45] <GeoGio3> is pat and palgues volume kinda low for anyone else?
[0:44:47] <%TeepPhoenix> Espeically when you learn to spook survivors with the teleport
[0:44:51] <%MiguelNewMexico> Freddy says gay rights
[0:44:51] <@SoFarFetched> killers and survivors were given pride flag keychains
[0:45:00] <%TeepPhoenix> Uh, all the elm Street movies are worth it
[0:45:10] <%TeepPhoenix> But 3 is probably the best sequel
[0:45:19] <%MiguelNewMexico> 3 is Dream Warriors right? def best

[0:53:28] <whoguru5> BUT IT'S SO SHINY PLAUGE
[0:53:33] <carnivoroux> why are they mad
[0:53:54] <%UmoLoco> Oro perk
[0:53:59] <lynlyn_ow> alert is great
[0:54:10] <%MarsKarl> Dead Hard is an enormous advantage if you can time it correctly
[0:54:13] <%nip_nips> i wanna ride bumper cars
[0:54:13] <%MiguelNewMexico> do donuts in the parking lot
[0:54:21] <+Undenizen> you don't think that's a bit fatalistic, Plague?
[0:54:35] <%king_wragles> Alert is getting used so much these days, I'm running Surge on everyone
[0:54:42] <whoguru5> I'm playing Dwight mostly and bond helps a bit because I can tell from some survivor movements they are being chased
[0:54:45] <+logoth_> dead hard
[0:55:00] <+logoth_> when you die you get hard
[0:55:01] <Valdorick> Oh wow, the uh...
[0:55:10] <Valdorick> ... Pub just got rekt
[0:55:13] <%RayReborne> oh no, the best player got downed!
[0:55:18] <lynlyn_ow> i feel like balanced landing is the better exhaustion perk
[0:55:20] <%MiguelNewMexico> when i die i hope i shit all over my boner
[0:55:34] <%MarsKarl> DS and DH can be vital for high level play, timing them precisely can win you the game
[0:55:41] <Valdorick> BOLD
[0:56:04] <$TheNewZealandStory> @lynlyn_ow balanced landing is situational that its basically useless in most chases
[0:56:13] <$TheNewZealandStory> the trapper buff isnt live yet
[0:56:15] <nightmaremoons_0v0> I know you won't notice me but it will be a dream for my idol to notice me
[0:56:19] <markdreizehn> Plague tells people not to just walk crouch everywhere, Paige proceeds to walk crouch everywhere. We lvoe to see it
[0:56:23] <%DocMadfox> Trapper got buffed? Might have to come back then.
[0:56:58] <+The_Protagonist> ***what is happening***
[0:57:04] <@SoFarFetched> Sounds like a farming match
[0:57:05] <Valdorick> This is... very strange.
[0:57:11] <californaya> This is top tier DBD
[0:57:11] <+polothegreatest> its a trap LUL
[0:57:12] <eyeobject> now give him a kiss
[0:57:14] <%RayReborne> yeah FARM
[0:57:17] <+MidnightBurst12> friend :D
[0:57:19] <%MiguelNewMexico> he's lulling you into a false sense of security!
[0:57:19] <@SoFarFetched> everyone get your hoes out
[0:57:21] <@SoFarFetched> its time to farm
[0:57:21] <%king_wragles> so the music is freaking the fuck out
[0:57:26] <%GalacticaPhanto> who gives a shit if he's friendly I'm still gonna run my shit
[0:57:29] <@Jekado> Farrrrmmmmm
[0:57:32] <+The_Protagonist> so basically it's killers and the survivors letting each other get points?
[0:57:37] <californaya> yep
[0:57:38] <theemotionalacehearts> woah sound is fucked
[0:57:38] <whoguru5> It's like a sandvich heavy in tf2
[0:57:41] <@SoFarFetched> yeah pretty much
[0:57:44] <whoguru5> how cute
[0:57:48] <@SoFarFetched> its "hey I give you some hits,now give me some hits"
[0:58:00] <lynlyn_ow> @TheNewZealandStory most maps have hills, tractors, second floor etc to set off BL. Also if you fall onto basement stairs it also goes off so it always works. Lithe and DH have huge delays so they may not kick off before you get hit
[0:58:14] <@SoFarFetched> also might as well look for totems in worst case scenario surprise NOED
[0:58:55] <@Jekado> pat doesn't want points
[0:59:06] <%RayReborne> big scared of friend man
[0:59:23] <@SoFarFetched> wow plague just FARTED on that trapper
[0:59:23] <+The_Protagonist> bonk
[0:59:33] <Valdorick> Its gonna be great when he turns around and hooks all 4 of you.
[0:59:44] <%itsBIPBIP> oh shank
[0:59:51] <@SoFarFetched> Plague and Paige get ALLL the points except for Pat.
[1:00:01] <%LucidZig> LucidZig subscribed with Prime. 
[1:00:41] <%MiguelNewMexico> take off every zig!
[1:00:42] <%Spydurman> dude imagine playing like this and then killing everyone at the last second
[1:00:48] <eyeobject> No point for pat
[1:00:58] <%GalacticaPhanto> I hate this. this is would be boring as hell for me
[1:01:12] <Valdorick> Yeah, give him all 4 hooks Kappa
[1:01:14] <+chiazam> STEALTH
[1:01:15] <$FrostedZaibatsu> Is this collusion?
[1:01:22] <%MiguelNewMexico> stinky boosters
[1:01:31] <%AncelDeLambert> I swear this happens to you at least once a stream
[1:01:33] <Make_me_mad> I want them to hit that last generator, NOED triggers, and he just fucks you all up.
[1:01:39] <+chiazam> Wait is the Killer not killing what
[1:01:46] <@SoFarFetched> yeah its farming match
[1:01:47] <Dunmarkh> I've seen this happen every dead by daylight stream of yours I've watched.
[1:01:49] <%RayReborne> SUCK YA DICK FOR SOME POINTS
[1:01:54] <@SoFarFetched> and yeah its pretty much if you dont want a farming match you just disconnect.
[1:01:55] <Valdorick> amazing
[1:01:58] <%king_wragles> he's probably doing that 50 gen kick archive
[1:01:59] <%itsBIPBIP> tHATS A THREAT
[1:02:01] <%Faustgesicht> Yeah, most farming parties I run into make sure killer never gets a hook
[1:02:02] <eyeobject> Just tell me what you want me to suck!
[1:02:04] <$NitronStreams> I thought the gen exploded
[1:02:37] <+chiazam> Can you get more points from a farming match than kiiling?
[1:02:52] <slix3431> DayZ is a better murderer game than this
[1:02:59] <%BigFingerRo> @chiazam A LOT more
[1:03:04] <%RayReborne> backflip!
[1:03:10] <+chiazam> @chiazam LMFAO
[1:03:48] <Explodincatz> yea kill Pat
[1:03:54] <%RayReborne> JOIN US ORBMAN
[1:03:57] <%AncelDeLambert> points are pointless
[1:04:09] <RadAtVideoGames> Is it supposed to sound like someone is rapidly turning the sound effect volume up and down?
[1:04:20] <%jetstreamlove_R> wait what's up whit the heartbeat?
[1:04:29] <%AncelDeLambert> yeah, the audio around the Killer is really weird
[1:04:33] <+goose_attack_almanac> heartbeat signifies how close the Killer is
[1:04:43] <+goose_attack_almanac> wait
[1:04:43] <%RayReborne> stop is for forever
[1:04:45] <%BigFingerRo> When the anniversary was going on, we had someone here getting real pissy at farming matches and how not doing that in the anniversary was kinda shitty
[1:04:52] <%RayReborne> need to hear go Kappa
[1:04:55] <RadAtVideoGames> Couldn't tell it was a heartbeat
[1:05:08] <%BigFingerRo> because "I WANNA WIN! I PLAY THIS GAME TO WIN"
[1:05:09] <@SoFarFetched> @BigFingerRo god I remember that guy,he just stayed here to complain the entire time instead of JUST LEAVING LUL
[1:05:27] <%BigFingerRo> he HAD to win the argument
[1:05:29] <%asthanius> He's shy
[1:05:32] <@SoFarFetched> "give us uppies trapper!"
[1:05:36] <%RayReborne> catch these Camp councillor CHEEKS Kappa
[1:05:38] <%BigFingerRo> arguments are all about winning you see
[1:05:38] <%jetstreamlove_R> isn't the heartbeat sensor defeat the porpose of the killer getting the jump on ya?
[1:05:39] <BoxNavy> EleGiggle
[1:05:41] <%Faustgesicht> LUL
[1:05:43] <Valdorick> LUL
[1:05:59] <%BigFingerRo> all arguments have a clear winner
[1:06:07] <%asthanius> maybe he gets off on this
[1:06:17] <%BigFingerRo> and you wanna win by any means necessary because losing feels bad :(
[1:06:22] <%GalacticaPhanto> Pat was like Im finna leave
[1:06:24] <@SoFarFetched> ive definitely done that where I do a farming match if I Need to do specific challenges as killer.
[1:06:51] <@SoFarFetched> give him your lunchbox

[1:07:57] <californaya> like that Da Share Zone image of JUST LEAVE
[1:07:58] <%BigFingerRo> Hey @PeachSaliva could you ask plague what he thinks about the borg queen, the one that has that cool slick texture on her skin?
[1:07:59] <@SoFarFetched> Ive had some killers where its like "yeah I accidentally queued up and not realize" and the match was very quick
[1:08:02] <californaya> HIT THE BRICKS
[1:08:06] <%jetstreamlove_R> it be funny if the dev adds a handicap if people teabag too mcuh
[1:08:11] <%king_wragles> 'Count to 3, then leave them be' is what I go by for survivors games
[1:08:16] <$Niney_Who> Unless it's a 4-person SWF who all have keys

[1:09:10] <burnerbabe> I mean, dbd has basically turned into 4 survivors bullying a poor innocent killer LUL
[1:09:22] <slix3431> lol
[1:09:24] <%BigFingerRo> This session has been sorely lacking on the NERD ALERRRRRTs
[1:09:28] <$Niney_Who> I can't play Ghostface anymore I just get bullied

[1:30:22] <%ssjklyco> Famous cause you may choke from a leaf

[1:30:33] <Prism_Wing> lytCLAP chili dog!
[1:30:42] <%Seethrin> Was it because he was about to eat a hotdog?
[1:30:46] <%BigFingerRo> Peaches will make the chilli and when it's all done and ready, she'll spill all of the pot over
[1:30:46] <%GalacticaPhanto> I think this is the legit first time I've actually seen this map in action
[1:30:52] <eyeobject> Pat cries over many things
[1:31:04] <+PenmanLupine> yeesh that music sounds awful
[1:31:05] <Visorak6> Is the music supposed to be doing that?
[1:31:14] <whoguru5> I mean the map looks nice as a recreation it's just not great as a map overall
[1:31:16] <IssaBoneman> This map should be big ol fun jaeeGiggle jaeeGiggle
[1:31:17] <$shurtal> it's is like a drunk roomate, trying to stealth her way into the house at 3am, yet still putting out 100 decibels
[1:31:24] <$Niney_Who> That hurts my ears, jeeze
[1:31:28] <Valdorick> Birb
[1:31:28] <%AncelDeLambert> the terror radius is screwing up the music something awful
[1:31:32] <%JoshManVGH> @sofarfetched That's how we make beeeees
[1:31:34] <twistedj3ster> i'm glad I'm not the only person to think that music is a sin against audio creation
[1:31:35] <+Mekhet09> That sound is awful.
[1:31:40] <+SorakuFett> This is actually mentally aggravating.
[1:31:43] <%AncelDeLambert> I don't think the chase music is supposed to sound like that
[1:31:58] <sydowoodo> didn't she walk right by a gen????
[1:32:05] <%AncelDeLambert> man, that heartbeat is loud
[1:32:06] <IssaBoneman> @sorakufett That‚Äôs the general effect this map has lol
[1:32:09] <Mahrota> Legion wants a big terror radius, they use it to track survivors in Frenzy
[1:32:13] <+SorakuFett> I can like feel the music fucking with my heartbeat, and not in a suspenseful way.
[1:32:50] <IssaBoneman> Goddamn VHS can‚Äôt come out soon enough
[1:32:52] <%JoshManVGH> "Oh yeah baby life goes on, long after the thrill of living is gone" is a hell of a mood though
[1:33:12] <%AncelDeLambert> yeah, the audio is DEFINITELY not supposed to be doing this during a chase
[1:33:23] <+FadingEmber> This bgm sounds like they put a mic to wet gorilla cheeks during a brap session
[1:33:30] <KetsuoTaberu> that taxidermy wolf scared me lol
[1:33:59] <%AncelDeLambert> why is the wolf just sitting all the way out there?
[1:34:02] <$TheNewZealandStory> why is the audio so blown out sounding
[1:34:09] <%AncelDeLambert> it's in front of a cabinet, tf for?
[1:34:16] <+KingpinLarry> how'd they miss you twice?
[1:34:18] <%GalacticaPhanto> And to think, taxidermy used to be my hobby
[1:34:23] <@SoFarFetched> PAIGE SENT YOU GUYS HERE
[1:34:30] <Geeeff123> can you make plague louder?
[1:34:36] <IssaBoneman> ‚ÄúLaughs of actually pain‚Äù

[1:36:28] <californaya> what map is this, is this the new RE map?
[1:36:35] <@SoFarFetched> yeah its the RPD map
[1:36:37] <%Seethrin> I think so
[1:36:41] <californaya> I've never actually seen it played before

[1:36:49] <IssaBoneman> @californaya Yeaaa unfortunately it sucks booty hole
[1:37:04] <@SoFarFetched> yeah people get lost on this map easily.
[1:37:05] <californaya> seems tighter than the Stranger Things map, lol
[1:37:09] <@SoFarFetched> even the killer
[1:37:23] <%InuOblivion> this map is so unfair to survivors
[1:37:25] <$TheNewZealandStory> i love this map and find it very easy to navigate and loop on
[1:37:27] <@SoFarFetched> goodbye stranger things map in a few months
[1:37:39] <%RayReborne> uh i drank a whole canadian bag of milk is that bad?
[1:37:42] <whoguru5> @SoFarFetched it's just dunzo?
[1:37:43] <$TheNewZealandStory> the hawkins map is awful, i'm glad its leaving
[1:37:53] <californaya> oh, is the licensing rights running out for Stranger Things stuff?
[1:37:55] <BoxNavy> its bad to do
[1:37:56] <%RayReborne> not old at all
[1:37:58] <IssaBoneman> Yea Behavior doesn‚Äôt know how to make indoor maps unfortunately
[1:38:00] <whoguru5> how old IS milk rooThink
[1:38:02] <%nip_nips> old enough to vote

[1:38:13] <BoxNavy> yeah its a boobies...
[1:38:15] <Mythematical> hey i'm here for my regular prescribed "you're great have a good one" and leaving event
[1:38:19] <@SoFarFetched> @whoguru5 they dont have the licensing anymore  for stranger things so the survivors/killers and map will be removed in november
[1:38:30] <tanarath> marriage titty
[1:38:34] <lloyddboy> we had bagged milk in grade school and idiots would just stomp on them
[1:38:40] <lloyddboy> i'm idiots btw
[1:38:43] <%RayReborne> i said canadian cuz i knew Paige would know and also idk how much is in one lol
[1:38:47] <@SoFarFetched> But if you purchased the survivors/killers you keep them
[1:38:48] <+MackFighters> the map doesn't change the music Plague
[1:38:49] <KuriKurikoCH> 8 raiders from KuriKurikoCH have joined! 
[1:38:54] <KetsuoTaberu> 1 bag is 1 liter IIRC
[1:39:00] <%JoshManVGH> Someone posted that "Cheese is just a loaf of milk" and I've been thinking about that a lot lately.
[1:39:00] <$AmanDotZip> assasinate pat
[1:39:03] <hearingthenseeing> It doesn't taste different lol
[1:39:07] <whoguru5> @SoFarFetched can't you at least get the killer / survivors by owning the dlc right now?
[1:39:08] <KetsuoTaberu> or 1.33 liters?
[1:39:08] <@SoFarFetched> @KuriKurikoCH thanks for the raid geefAww
[1:39:12] <hearingthenseeing> It's just milk
[1:39:16] <BoxNavy> and ontario
[1:39:16] <Mythematical> @MackFighters that's not what he said
[1:39:21] <@MelBrooksKA> No, it is not just Canada
[1:39:22] <Zombrocom> Nah, west coast doesn't have bagged milk
[1:39:23] <Void_The_Dark> In Pat's giant hamster bottle.
[1:39:24] <a_mad_dragon_> bagged milk is NASTY
[1:39:25] <Zombrocom> It's an east coast thing
[1:39:29] <eyeobject> It's a milk thing
[1:39:29] <IssaBoneman> It‚Äôs very sus
[1:39:30] <@SoFarFetched> @whoguru5 yes if you purchase them you keep them.
[1:39:31] <@MelBrooksKA> It's mostly Quebec
[1:39:32] <%Faustgesicht> We had bagged milked in WI during grade school
[1:39:34] <%JoshManVGH> We do NOT have bagged milk in Maine. At least my part of Maine.
[1:39:37] <tanarath> Cheese IS a loaf of milk
[1:39:37] <Tracazoid> Yeah we have bagged milk here in Ontario
[1:39:49] <%JoshManVGH> Maybe in Calis or Fort Kent
[1:39:51] <Mister_McDerp> we had bagged milk in high school
[1:39:53] <KetsuoTaberu> can confirm Ontario is bagged milk land
[1:39:58] <%SinisterBroccoli> They don't do it in Vancouver for the most part
[1:39:58] <%asthanius> Why did bagged milk do this to you
[1:39:59] <KetsuoTaberu> but also cartons
[1:39:59] <%Dapper_Cactuar> oh god that clipping with the hook and the ceiling
[1:40:00] <@MelBrooksKA> You can mention this to other Canadians and they will think you are insane
[1:40:07] <$AmanDotZip> in MY ass/????
[1:40:11] <whoguru5> @SoFarFetched but i'm assuming the map is just leaving forever then?
[1:40:13] <hearingthenseeing> It's egg time
[1:40:15] <%RayReborne> see i ask because my stomach feels like its gonna explode and im a little concerned haha ha.... ha.......
[1:40:19] <IssaBoneman> Yes plague escape this hell lol
[1:40:20] <@SoFarFetched> @whoguru5 yes gone forever
[1:40:21] <Zombrocom> No bagged milk in west coast canada
[1:40:36] <@SoFarFetched> Unless Behavior makes a "similiar" map or something.
[1:40:45] <BoxNavy> yeah good
[1:40:48] <BoxNavy> thats good to have
[1:40:49] <%MarsKarl> yeah that's about it
[1:40:49] <Explodincatz> thats all Diablo is yes
[1:40:53] <$TheNewZealandStory> the music is so unbelievably loud
[1:41:05] <whoguru5> why in the fuck would you allow a game to have your licence and then go "nope fuck you buddy"
[1:41:06] <@SoFarFetched> I think he has the iridescent perk where it just triggers on the ENTIRE Map.
[1:41:12] <eyeobject> His "ara ara"
[1:41:13] <IssaBoneman> @sofarfetched Hopefully not I don‚Äôt think they‚Äôre good at all making indoor maps
[1:41:19] <$TheNewZealandStory> is this a new audio glitch
[1:41:33] <@SoFarFetched> yeah sounds like he has that add-on.
[1:41:51] <%Dapper_Cactuar> the problem is the heartbeat sound mess with the music so much here it's an audio mess
[1:41:58] <@SoFarFetched> if its the add-on where it makes the terror radius happen on the ENTIRE map its probably that.
[1:41:59] <twistedj3ster> last time I heard that kind of audio bug was the Shadows of Mordor PS3 version
[1:42:00] <ashenfrenzy> legion has an add-on that makes their terror radius the whole map when theyre using their ability
[1:42:09] <+MackFighters> Legion has a iridescent add on where he has terror on the whole map when in frenzy
[1:42:16] <$TheNewZealandStory> i bet the hatch is upstairs library
[1:42:30] <@SoFarFetched> Yeah its to confuse you to think he's nearby when he's not.
[1:42:33] <%RayReborne> well it makes the music sound godawful whatever it is
[1:42:39] <eyeobject> at least eli gets to live
[1:42:41] <%Scarnehu> paige and plague? think of that value!!

[1:48:01] <%Bigchill___> @PeachSaliva ask Eli about the beginning of the screaming skull warning

[1:50:30] <%asthanius> picard-o
[1:50:32] <yahir_the_boy22> BloodTrail
[1:50:34] <@SoFarFetched> the twitch one was buried already
[1:50:35] <yahir_the_boy22> BloodTrail BloodTrail
[1:50:39] <eyeobject> We have to keep Eli in a state of mild torture so he can keep arting
[1:50:41] <@Jekado> Fetch link the twitch earlier yeah
[1:50:47] <%Bigchill___> ahh
[1:50:48] <whoguru5> oh lordy it's bubb
[1:50:50] <%VritraReiRei> !so @PlagueOfGripes
[1:50:54] <Prism_Wing> Is it called picarto because it's made for star trek?
[1:50:54] <@SoFarFetched> Thats not set up yet
[1:50:55] <@SoFarFetched> LUL
[1:51:00] <Prism_Wing> Kappa
[1:51:01] <%MarsKarl> Bubba sipsipDab
[1:51:17] <BoxNavy> surely paige will set up nightbot Copium
[1:51:25] <lilachysteria> BOOBA
[1:51:31] <@SoFarFetched> yeah I need to find a day to help her set it up.
[1:51:42] <BoxNavy> baba...
[1:51:54] <@MelBrooksKA> @SoFarFetched I think I remember Strident has access and could set that up if Paige wants it
[1:52:12] <eyeobject> Baaaaabaaaa
[1:52:21] <@SoFarFetched> well adding nightbot to the twitch is only the streamer I believe.
[1:52:28] <whoguru5> buba is fucking busted
[1:52:35] <%VritraReiRei> didnt know it still had to be set up (thought it was default). looks like at least its not too difficult to set up
[1:52:36] <+LammasuRex> Rick and Morty ruined Hellraiser for me.
[1:52:38] <@SoFarFetched> But also Paige needs to work on a couple things too.
[1:52:41] <%Sotetsu> Universally despised... by Plague
[1:52:44] <%MarsKarl> it's unfortunate, because controlling Bubba can definitely be unwieldy and rough to handle
[1:52:58] <@SoFarFetched> yeah Im free tonight
[1:53:01] <BoxNavy> fetch maybe get her to add some bttv emotes too ;)
[1:53:02] <@SoFarFetched> after the stream
[1:53:05] <@SoFarFetched> I'll call you
[1:53:13] <hearingthenseeing> Paige you like eggs?
[1:53:21] <@MelBrooksKA> @SoFarFetched Pretty sure you can give people admin powers or something, don't remember off my head, not like I'm a big streamer
[1:53:26] <%BinaryFireball> old diablo?
[1:53:29] <%Scarnehu> I just had my wife watch through TNG onward and we just finished Voyager. I completely forgot Future Janeway blows up the borg so she can get their ship home. we were howling with laughter at how fucking stupid it was
[1:53:30] <BoxNavy> diabolo.....
[1:53:31] <%BinaryFireball> or ...new diablo?
[1:53:33] <JobbedBone> d3 console
[1:53:35] <%Spydurman> Resurrected or?
[1:53:42] <+FingaLights> De bablo
[1:54:00] <%grapplingwithdepression> haha message highlight
[1:54:14] <@SoFarFetched> @MelBrooksKA you can give "editor" status to mods so they can change the game title/category and run ads for you. As for bots I believe its mainly streamer.
[1:54:29] <@SoFarFetched> But we'll be discussing after the stream anyway.
[1:54:36] <%MarsKarl> survivors farming each other is agonizing
[1:54:53] <+chiazam> plague is getting tunneled
[1:55:06] <@SoFarFetched> LUL
[1:55:06] <%AncelDeLambert> yeah, that'd be cool
[1:55:09] <lloyddboy> LMAOOOOO
[1:55:09] <%Scarnehu> perfect timing
[1:55:09] <BoxNavy> bubba jumpscare
[1:55:10] <eyeobject> you had paige at skeleton
[1:55:14] <Valdorick> Load of horsecock
[1:55:17] <+FingaLights> That was a baller move
[1:55:19] <whoguru5> This fucking bubba tunneling like a mother fucker
[1:55:20] <%AncelDeLambert> Paige necromancer should be dope to watch
[1:55:23] <@SoFarFetched> The big tip with Bubba is  you REALLY need to be hugging the terrain
[1:55:25] <SovPho> YA GOTTA BE SLAPPIN MY TIDDIES
[1:55:25] <@SoFarFetched> so he f ucks up
[1:55:27] <%grapplingwithdepression> what does getting tunneled mean? ive owned this game for years and never once launchjed it
[1:55:27] <%MarsKarl> pallet LUL
[1:55:39] <%AncelDeLambert> now, what'll Pat play as
[1:55:42] <@SoFarFetched> cause if bubba's chainsaw hits an object he goes into a tantrum
[1:55:42] <tanarath> You can also launch bones & spirit skeletons at people @
[1:55:47] <%tweedler92> tweedler92 subscribed with Prime. They've subscribed for 8 months! 
[1:55:50] <+thotbane> @grapplingwithdepression A killer focusing on killing 1 player at the expense of letting gens pop
[1:55:51] <%MarsKarl> @grapplingwithdepression when the killer focuses on getting you out of the game even when given opportunity to hunt somebody else
[1:55:52] <whoguru5> @grapplingwithdepression i'm new but pretty much focusing one survivor so they die
[1:55:55] <+mrfriendlybro> @grapplingwithdepression means being repeatedly targeted, to the exclusion of other players
[1:55:55] <%AncelDeLambert> Sorceress is always a good choice, but I wonder if he'll play Barb
[1:55:58] <%Dakuu75> tunnel vision
[1:56:02] <Gambit_Gamble> same here
[1:56:05] <+chiazam> @grapplingwithdepression it means the killer tries to hook the same person multiple times
[1:56:09] <JobbedBone> railroaded into failure
[1:56:19] <%Faustgesicht> Hyperfocusing one player
[1:56:23] <$GarbageNirvana> Getting tunneled means git gud scrub
[1:56:41] <Ozavic> That's camping, not tunnel as far as I know
[1:56:41] <%Bigchill___> I hate puppy dogging
[1:56:51] <Ozavic> THAT's tunneling
[1:56:54] <%grapplingwithdepression> Dang that sounds like a dick move
[1:57:02] <@SoFarFetched> Camping is when you put them on hook and never leave the area and just WATCH them die.
[1:57:13] <+mrfriendlybro> @grapplingwithdepression yeah, the problem is it also can be quite effective
[1:57:13] <Ozavic> Yup
[1:57:18] <@SoFarFetched> Which there's been people who are REALLY bad at camping and if you got a good pincer attack,you can get the person off hook.
[1:57:19] <%MarsKarl> Can tunneling be determined by intent? If I literally can't find somebody else, I'm not gonna just let them go
[1:57:29] <lilachysteria> that‚Äôs ‚Äúproxy camping‚Äù
[1:57:34] <BackflipCharm> Isn't that exactly what Pat does?
[1:57:34] <JobbedBone> tunneling might involve camping, but can entail other behaviors
[1:57:36] <%grapplingwithdepression> @mrfriendlybro yeah i can see that
[1:57:39] <SovPho> to be fahr
[1:57:40] <@SoFarFetched> @MarsKarl it does happen when you unintentionally find the same person again even when you go for someone else.
[1:57:54] <@SoFarFetched> Ive had survivors somehow come back to me when I go in the opposite direction geefDense
[1:58:02] <lilachysteria> @marskarl that‚Äôs fair, i think eli‚Äôs mostly referring to killers who will only target one survivor at a time to injure/kill
[1:58:14] <%grapplingwithdepression> man i should play this game fr
[1:58:28] <@SoFarFetched> DbD now ACTUALLY has a tutorial too to help
[1:58:37] <@SoFarFetched> instead of pretty much "hey goodluck"
[1:58:49] <anAngryHamster> I think this Bubba just got a 4k
[1:58:54] <%Bigchill___> Aight guys, its late for me. Have a good evening.
[1:59:38] <%MarsKarl> Ugh can't believe they changed the ranked system to this
