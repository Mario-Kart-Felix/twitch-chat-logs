You're not as weak as I thought. But never forget that your best wasn't good enough to stop it. Now an entire fandom is crying because you lacked the strength to wait in line. The legend of Undertale needs to be re-written. I hope I'm there for the last chapter. It ends with your death.

[1:24:17] <DusK_The_Stray> Auto-run is on
[1:24:23] <+Kemmybelle> If she’s having back issues, would it be possible to bring Paiges streaming chair downstairs for her to use? You’d have to finagle the camera, but it might save her back for a longer stream.
[1:24:25] <+cvp5127> cube her up
[1:24:26] <tusk102> @Origamist1 no one knows how long the game is yet
[1:24:28] <+Genericho> @Origamist1 That was the plan but in the early goings here it doesn't seem like that's gonna be possible.
[1:24:28] <%JenovasPuppet> Z is X, X is B,  Space is Jump
[1:24:30] <MyNameIsRasus> check item guy

[4:50:56] <@SoFarFetched> Paige can't split her eyes
[4:50:58] <jerree66> That Noelle isn't acknowledgeing him at all
[4:50:58] <NateyBeak> Noelle did notice him once
[4:51:00] <$Sphincter_Spelunker> @Teyaric yeah she did
[4:51:01] <MyNameIsRasus> Noelle isn't acknowledging him
[4:51:01] <+senfood> Ralsei is a sweet boy. Leave him alone.
[4:51:02] <%Mr_Pylon> She did ask to be in front of him?
[4:51:03] <+MonsieurHedge> also, Noelle perfectly replaces ralsei, in case he kicks it or something
[4:51:06] <Hydrapissed> 🐁 F u get more eyes
[4:51:08] <$GeneralSCPatton> @jerree66 Noelle technically acknowledged Ralsei when she wanted to be right behind Susie
[4:51:08] <+gunderboy> The ralsei is sus
[4:51:08] <%RayReborne> Noelle commented on Ralsei when they saw him and Susie at the carnival
[4:51:10] <%AncelDeLambert> Noelle noticed him enough to ask to move up next to Susan
[4:51:12] <Them00n> Noelle mentioned him once.
[4:51:14] <@MelBrooksKA> Noelle mentioned Ralsei earlier when you ran away
[4:51:18] <$raziel391> She wonder who he was
[4:51:19] <%RayReborne> but was about to call him Asriel
[4:51:24] <@SoFarFetched> "Then I'll let you do ME next geefTux "
[4:51:25] <reonome> noelle asked ralsei to move
[4:51:26] <televisedrevolting> She noticed him at first. She was like "Why does that dude look like-"
[4:51:31] <%Treasure_Vault> Noelle mentioned she had to stand behind suzie, not Rai
[4:51:31] <Lancaster_H> "They look like fluffy boys to you?"
[4:51:32] <Ner234> She notices him
[4:51:32] <+zarkazeon> yes she does
[4:51:32] <Valkryna> she's in deep
[4:51:32] <Spydurman> Noelle kinda mentioned him when wanting to be behind Susie
[4:51:33] <scrawnydutchman> NOELLE SIMPING FOR SUSIE
[4:51:36] <$Sphincter_Spelunker> when they were eating cotton candy, Noelle said Suzie was next to someone
[4:51:37] <+SilentEric> Noelle noticed Ralsie when you see them eating cotton candy.
[4:51:39] <17sevens> noelle got it BAD
[4:51:40] <+senfood> Noelle is DOWN BAD.
[4:51:40] <+blastyoboots> @PatStaresAt Noelle acknowledged his existence but only so she could move behind Suzie instead of him
[4:51:40] <peachy996> I think Berdly acknowledged him once
[4:51:42] <%AncelDeLambert> She noticed him when Susan and Ralsei were hanging out at the fair
[4:51:42] <Sokumotanaka> Paige he did aknowledge him she said "I should stand behind susie"
[4:51:43] <$Polarix64> She's way too horny for Susie
[4:51:43] <%dukenux> Noelle is too focused on Sus
[4:51:46] <tusk102> noelle asked him to let her stand in front of him so she could be behind susie @PeachSaliva
[4:51:47] <NateyBeak> Noelle said "he looks like someone i know" earlier but ey idk
[4:51:48] <+NiktenKing> Noelle wanted to be behind Susie
[4:51:48] <MyNameIsRasus> Noelle saw Ralsei with Susie in the stalls earlier
[4:51:52] <+Walopoh> He doesn't have to be non-existent to still be acting sus
[4:51:53] <DusK_The_Stray> Yeah, when she wanted to be behind Susie

[5:54:12] <%MiguelNewMexico> man, we've come a long way since AOL days
[5:54:12] <bakkatohri> Approx 4 hours if you're spamming B button to make text faster.
[5:54:13] <$Puhff> dont tell them!
[5:54:14] <@SoFarFetched> I havent played it my self
[5:54:17] <%Treasure_Vault> Well I mean, it came out when it came out
[5:54:20] <%Treasure_Vault> soooo
[5:54:24] <Edible_Enthusiasm> its been out since 8
[5:54:26] <shieldecho> Uh, downloaded it at 8 and it's 1:24 now...someone do math, brain tired
[5:54:27] <kingra> I know what that is but I won't say
[5:54:31] <DusK_The_Stray> Talk to Hackerman?
[5:54:34] <mikeriffic> I only play mobile games myself
[5:54:36] <@SoFarFetched> so about 5 hours ish
[5:54:38] <RealThiele> 5:24 timer
[5:54:39] <sporeian94> talk to hackerman
[5:54:41] <@SoFarFetched> so for paige next two hours maybe
[5:54:44] <%MiguelNewMexico> how do i know if i have a brain tumor
[5:54:45] <$Puhff> make them suffer Keepo
[5:54:46] <@MelBrooksKA> !uptime
[5:54:50] <$Sphincter_Spelunker> 5 and half
[5:54:50] <17sevens> took me 4ish hours all up, but i play games rather fast
[5:54:53] <@SoFarFetched> we dont have the uptime anymore.
[5:54:54] <wujak> it was as long as you have been playing now
[5:54:56] <@Jekado> 6 and a half hours?
[5:54:58] <+JGardner03> 5.5 hours if you do everything
[5:55:09] <@SoFarFetched> Im still guessing this will take paige 7 hours like the last stream.
[5:55:10] <bakkatohri> These shortcuts are just like D A R K S O U L S
[5:55:13] <sporeian94> BUTT SAUCE

[5:55:45] <%RayReborne> ehy did yoy say bottom then Pat Kappa
[5:55:46] <tusk102> @PeachSaliva seems to be about 5-7 hours depending on if you spam through text. so yall have like less an an hour most likely
[5:55:47] <@SoFarFetched> Yeah there was still something on the right
[5:55:50] <%Cozy90> ye
[5:55:52] <DatZigga> Sun is down
[5:55:57] <shieldecho> NOT A SPOILER - I sucked at the final boss so that probably added a half hour of playtime
[5:56:01] <%MiguelNewMexico> i mean, i have PLENTY of butt juice. but you can never have too much. unless you eat at Taco Bell first. hoho gotem
[5:56:02] <$Sphincter_Spelunker> probably like 2 hours left
[5:56:03] <+Genericho> oh god
[5:56:05] <+Walopoh> I'm assuming IF there's extra content to talk to everybody at the end, that'll be an extra hour or so. Honestly it makes sense if you need to finish later and enjoy it
[5:56:08] <@SoFarFetched> Its not your fault all the characters are hot and make you not think straight,Paige kappa
[5:56:09] <ZComiX> You need to tell the hacker about the lock
[5:56:10] <@SoFarFetched> Kappa *
[5:56:11] <$raziel391> no paige you are just tired
[5:56:38] <tusk102> @PeachSaliva yall have about an hour or so left seems to be general consensus?
[5:56:41] <shieldecho> Also not reading every line of dialogue out loud probably made my playtime shorter
[5:56:51] <%MiguelNewMexico> so like, Ralsei's a boy right? he just likes wearing a dress? because that's totally my fetish
[5:56:52] <$Puhff> @PeachSaliva have you found the Candace secret yet?

[6:41:08] <heartlesshealer> I didn't realize that was a spoiler, I'll shut up
[6:41:21] <@SoFarFetched> Please remember if you come in here after beating the game, no spoilers please.
[6:41:25] <@SoFarFetched> no I think that wasn't towards you.
[6:41:28] <+Deekman> All you have to do it keep toasting her. When the walls down throw
[6:41:34] <@SoFarFetched> a couple people have come in here saying they beat the game.
[6:41:40] <%MiguelNewMexico> anybody got a beater for like 500 bucks in the New England area?
[6:41:46] <%AncelDeLambert> offensive toast LUL

[6:43:05] <@Jekado> i mean it is... acid
[6:43:08] <%RayReborne> maybe red buster when the shield is down wont outright kill her, and she'll waste turns healing instead of putting up her shield???? maybe?
