[0:16:50] <$cade_calrayn> "I'm pure" - Paige, on many occasions
[0:16:51] <skyentombment> Paige hears the Yanky Doodle Donkey and goes catatonic
[0:16:53] <SirCold_> Abe Lincoln's ghost should be a dbd killer

[0:17:59] <@Jekado> Paige must hate that episode of venture brothers with the Ghost of Abraham Lincoln
[0:18:02] <CyborgAV> If you talk enough shit about Abraham Lincoln, he'll come back and suspend Habeas Corpus again

[0:21:11] <%Chichen> the ocean is just wet space
[0:21:13] <+LonePlus_> fruit pop tarts gros
[0:21:18] <Madovir> fuck the sea and everything in it
[0:21:19] <hearingthenseeing> Fuck the ocean
[0:21:21] <YakumoYomi> @benjiFG Dude, the ocean is way scarier to me than space. There might be actual sea monsters down there.
[0:21:22] <+Taisuru> The ocean reflects space
[0:21:23] <%zamatermort> Why are you like this
[0:21:24] <KazairLux> the ocean is big scary
[0:21:28] <$TrashLeviathan> the ocean is just blue nighttime
[0:21:30] <$rdark_ksu> Ocean is also super rad
[0:21:32] <TheFramedWarlock> The ocean is just boneless earth
[0:21:34] <+colouroftheiris77> Stay out them oceans!
[0:21:35] <@commanderclaw> The Loch Ness monster is just a whale dick actually
[0:21:36] <$AzureGale> Hey Paige have you ever heard of the Mr. Paranoid of the Ocean Guy ad for Real Men of Genius
[0:21:40] <+Taisuru> THE LOCH NESS MONSTER
[0:21:42] <Parapattern> What freaks me out about space is the possibility of ocean worlds full of giant fish monsters
[0:21:46] <Jodoxk1> The Ocean is just Space with more liquid
[0:21:46] <+Mekhet09> Why are you so ruled by your dreams?
[0:21:46] <%Chichen> WHAT IF
[0:21:47] <CaptainPileDriver> there was a time when I went into the ocean and I got hit by a big wave and the ocean ripped my swim trunks off
[0:21:49] <thebalticguy1> I imagine Pat telling you Lovecraftian tales, and you sleep like a baby
[0:21:51] <TonberryLives> I like the unknowable horror of the deep LUL
[0:21:53] <CaptainPileDriver> NO
[0:21:53] <Valdorick> I mean, the ocean is SUPER haunted, so swimming fast is good
[0:21:53] <kasteni> Whale penis?
[0:21:53] <YakumoYomi> He'll ask you for tree-fiddy
[0:21:55] <+LonePlus_> DUD I HAD A DREAM IN PRE K WHERE THE BIG SCUBA GUY FROM FINDING NEMO TRIED TO STUFF ME IN A BAG
[0:21:57] <%holydeviant1> but what if the loch ness monster was whale dick
[0:21:57] <KazairLux> small chug
[0:21:59] <%Shotgun_Hobo1> Paige is scared of fish, H.P. Lovecraft confirmed
[0:21:59] <CaptainPileDriver> THATS WORSE THE LINCOLN
[0:21:59] <hearingthenseeing> You think it won't swim faster?
[0:22:00] <mnightshyamallama2> oh shit a paige stream havent seen one of these in a while. now my night is better
[0:22:01] <%Ranryu692> What if a whale dick is trying to get you
[0:22:03] <+LonePlus_> IT FUCKED ME UP FOR LIFE
[0:22:03] <+prodeuce13> why is u in middle of the west?
[0:22:05] <skyentombment> yes, the monster from scotland will come getcha
[0:22:07] <UrsaMinor222> what the duck paige
[0:22:08] <$TrashLeviathan> what if the loch ness monster was the friends you made along the way
[0:22:09] <+Taisuru> Paige playing Dignity Chicken with herself
[0:22:09] <$JoshManVGH> Are Cryptids real?
[0:22:11] <+Rolandknight> Their called Deep Ones @PeachSaliva
[0:22:11] <ragasquid> who is the guest
[0:22:12] <lildaddybree99> everyone knows nessy is friendly
[0:22:14] <Valdorick> Do you know how many people have died in the ocean!? Ocean is MEGA haunted
[0:22:14] <person181> that's  just like getting mad at someone for what they did in a dream
[0:22:15] <%Ranryu692> wait, why is there a whale in a Scottish lake?
[0:22:16] <koffeemancer> i totally get you about the ocean tho. imagining being in the ocean where its to dark to see anything is hella scary
[0:22:16] <%walternatorz> is the mood the result of not having mcdonalds?
[0:22:16] <@MelBrooksKA> Paige's fears seem to be strongly connected by sleep
[0:22:17] <skyentombment> NOT
[0:22:17] <$rdark_ksu> @commanderclaw I saw that too and I feel it’s fitting that’s what Nessie is
[0:22:18] <+YoSoyConando89> Nessiejust wants 3.50
[0:22:19] <skyentombment> BUT
[0:22:20] <%eampora> eampora subscribed with Prime.
[0:22:20] <thebalticguy1> LINCOLN WAS THE LOCK NESS MONSTER THEY BOTH START WITH L
[0:22:25] <%FacetiousAF> fuckin "swim team" branches to so much lore
[0:22:28] <%SilverJakler> Are you a Dream Warrior?
[0:22:29] <olwe123> BUT
[0:22:29] <+Order_of_Mystery> you should play subnautica then, Paige! not only is the loch ness monster there, but so are several of it's increasingly larger, terrifying siblings!
[0:22:32] <wdmmgbtmvevo> Abraham Lincoln riding the lockness monster
[0:22:33] <Ziegsy> Lincon was a whale dick?
[0:22:39] <Zeif00> Have you attempted to lucid dream to control the demons?
[0:22:42] <Neo_Kaiser> Paige fears the D.
[0:22:43] <TheFramedWarlock> I'm not superstitious, but I'm being haunted by the ghost of Abraham Lincoln LUL
[0:22:46] <person181> teach yourself to not dream
[0:22:51] <thebalticguy1> Lincoln was AHAB THE WHOLE TIME
[0:22:52] <remainprofane> The problem with having an open mind is closing it again
[0:22:53] <hearingthenseeing> If Paige lucid dreamed it might kill you
[0:22:57] <+Taisuru> @thebalticguy1 Abraham L. Monster
[0:23:03] <r0termond> Does anyone knows if she is done with ds3?
[0:23:10] <augusta_wind> spiritual enemies...
[0:23:10] <Neo_Kaiser> If you die in a dream you die for real!
[0:23:10] <+strakillias> PSA to chat: The Abe Lincoln thing has been mentioned in passing at least as far back as 2018. We (chat) just didn't dig deeper into it until recently.
[0:23:14] <%CommanderSqueaks> CommanderSqueaks subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 21 months! Dreams are just Space inside of your brain. Vast, infinite, unknowable. Of course it makes you anxious. By the way, happy second stream baby.
[0:23:14] <@commanderclaw> You know you can learn to fight the monsters in your dream. I sometimes wake up and punch my mattress
[0:23:15] <Djinnazz> nothing, it means nothing
[0:23:17] <Valdorick> You are cursed, so enemy would work too
[0:23:17] <%Ranryu692> is it the curse?
[0:23:18] <%RedPanda25> I was scared of the the wolves in The Lady in the Water that pop out of the little hills. I had 2 hills outside my bedroom window.
[0:23:19] <$TrashLeviathan> what if the witches curse was the loch ness monster
[0:23:19] <jetpack_rorschasch> SHE HAS A STAND!
[0:23:22] <+Ynkubus_> Nessie isnt whale dick, but some other lake monster like ogopogo might be
[0:23:24] <TurtlesAndTentacles> FUCKING DEMON
[0:23:25] <+Mekhet09> How much do you dream? I don't talk to people about this but it's almost zero.
[0:23:25] <Srthunda> I adore horifiying dreams, they are alot of fun and the only type of dreams I can remain lucid in
[0:23:26] <Oxybe> Abe Lincoln is Paige's spiritual enemy
[0:23:28] <freelancebabymaker> its the lupus
[0:23:28] <mustachegolem> it means she likes you
[0:23:30] <olwe123> its from the CURSE!
[0:23:32] <Fefe41> It means you need to buy this talisman for $50,000
[0:23:32] <Zeif00> Paige can fire Ki blasts confirmed
[0:23:32] <%SilverJakler> (That was a reference to that one Nightmare on Elm Street movie lol)
[0:23:34] <TonberryLives> CHARISMA
[0:23:35] <person181> sounds  like ESP to me
[0:23:35] <dizimous> High CHA score
[0:23:38] <thebalticguy1> Its your ability to get stream followers
[0:23:39] <$cade_calrayn> Of course you have a lot of spiritual enemy, it's the witch's curse
[0:23:40] <hearingthenseeing> Us women are connected to the Spiritual Energy
[0:23:44] <+FingaLights> Spiritual Enema?
[0:23:46] <+Taisuru> psaGoblin
[0:23:48] <@commanderclaw> It could just be the Monopoly man in a top hat
[0:23:50] <fritz_dacat> Maybe your a large medium
[0:23:56] <%FaultyJawa> I get deja vu from dreams too
[0:24:01] <remainprofane> Charisma and supernaturality have so much overlap even if it the latter doesn’t exist
[0:24:02] <Valdorick> Time is a River, and you're hydrophobic.
[0:24:07] <thebalticguy1> THE PROPHET PAIGE PREDICTTS THE RESURECTION OF LINCOLN
[0:24:09] <%FaultyJawa> Literally bits of time that I see years later
[0:24:14] <$TrashLeviathan> i also get deja vu from dreams of mundane things
[0:24:20] <+patriotrenegade> BEHOLD THE MESSIAH
[0:24:25] <$TrashLeviathan> but like incredibly specific mundane things
[0:24:29] <filialpails> small medium at large
[0:24:31] <+Taisuru> And Pat is a Small Medium at Large
[0:24:32] <RatherUninteresting> yah I get the same thing its the CRUSHING deja vu
[0:24:35] <%FaultyJawa> Exactly leviathan
[0:24:40] <Oxybe> IN ALL HER MUSTARD GLORY
[0:24:45] <thebalticguy1> Oh I do the same
[0:24:46] <SirCold_> small town large medium
[0:24:48] <@commanderclaw> Paige's gamer laptop with all the RGB and gamer peripherals
[0:24:50] <%walternatorz> you say that like it was the keyboard's fault
[0:24:53] <$feralspidey> I had a few reoccurring fights with Slendy back the summer of 2012, until I was watching Toonami with my brother and his military friends when the Slender Man game review popped on. They all laughed, confused as to that being what people were afraid of when war and disaster are ever present.
[0:24:54] <Zeif00> Reading your dream journal would be interesting
[0:25:02] <$feralspidey> *reoccuring fights in dream
[0:25:06] <thebalticguy1> Have you gotten Jamais Vu?
[0:25:08] <+Mekhet09> I once dreamt I was playing a video game I've never head about. until I played it. Sometimes I think things are predestined and I'm fucked because it's always deja vu about boring shit.
[0:25:08] <GrizzMango> Hi peaches! How are you today? I hope you're well
[0:25:09] <%holydeviant1> My mom calls it "Dreaming around corners"
[0:25:19] <CallMeTheBaus> Oh shit i get that too! Hyper-specific, pointless recall
[0:25:23] <Valdorick> I once had a dream a friend who had left town visited me, then woke up to them knocking at the door.
[0:25:30] <@commanderclaw> Really? To me, dreams are hyper personal.
[0:25:31] <+logoth_> How can anything be weirder than Scrooge McDuck giving you a bee spiked sandwich
[0:25:34] <%Chichen> Pat is the incarnation of your dreams
[0:25:35] <remainprofane> Yeah have a spooky stream
[0:25:36] <KazairLux> yes please with Pat and Plague
[0:25:37] <%walternatorz> he's already your dream guy
[0:25:37] <VritraReiRei> D:
[0:25:39] <+Taisuru> That's because Pat doesn't exist sweety
[0:25:40] <lildaddybree99> Keep what you want to yourself. you deserve personal stuff away from us
[0:25:41] <%CommanderSqueaks> You don't have dreams because you live the dream with him every day. barrShy
[0:25:41] <Pookiedaexzile> Because you're living it
[0:25:41] <+prodeuce13> i've never had a dream about pat too
[0:25:42] <+SwdVengeance> IS PAT EVEN REAL!?!?!?
[0:25:43] <+cereal_box_conspiracy> That would make me feel sad if I were Pat.
[0:25:45] <thebalticguy1> Dream about elmo or zangeif?
[0:25:45] <$feralspidey> dreams with flight, or other powers are cool.
[0:25:45] <+Ynkubus_> Its cause you're living the dream!
[0:25:45] <$cade_calrayn> I remember VODs where you mention having dreams about him
[0:25:45] <%holydeviant1> He is so grounded in reality he doesn't show up in dreams
[0:25:45] <+Kindan55> Maybe he's the fake one, and not Woolie
[0:25:45] <@commanderclaw> That's cause every day living with Pat is like being in a dream
[0:25:46] <$TrashLeviathan> pat isnt real
[0:25:47] <%Chichen> IS PAT REAL
[0:25:47] <+medusasghost> oh god hes a ghost
[0:25:47] <Valdorick> The absolutely worst thing is part of the deja vu being the feeling of deja vu
[0:25:48] <GrizzMango> I rarely dream about my wife
[0:25:49] <person181> i mean some of my dreams have their own cannon and take place  in the same city, so far i've been there for a weeks worth of time
[0:25:51] <CallMeTheBaus> Pat is dream-proof
[0:25:51] <+logoth_> Living da dream
[0:25:52] <mustachegolem> I never though aboutit but I alse never had a dream with my boyfriend of 4 years
[0:25:53] <+kewlmyc> Pat isn't real
[0:25:53] <%SilverJakler> Because Pat's already your dream come true UwU
[0:25:53] <RatherUninteresting> nah that Deja vu puts me in a mood all day
[0:25:55] <lKaleidoscopel> what if pat never existed?
[0:25:56] <Parapattern> I haven't remembered a single dream in nearly 8 years or so
[0:25:56] <RGBgamesinc> pat is the dream
[0:25:57] <remainprofane> I’ve never had a dream about a friend but always an S/O
[0:25:57] <dizimous> PAT IS A VAMPIRE?!?!?!
[0:25:59] <$feralspidey> What does Pat dream of?
[0:25:59] <+strakillias> Well do you even have non-nightmare dreams?
[0:26:02] <Jaysky> Pat is a skeleton on the inside
[0:26:03] <%SilverJakler> damn it someone beat me to it
[0:26:03] <Vakojin> Pat is skeletton

[0:26:08] <+CptnCampy61> Are we sure Pat even exists?
[0:26:09] <SirCold_> Your brain needs a break from him
[0:26:10] <Zeif00> Can't dream all that ASS
[0:26:10] <Ziegsy> Pat is abe lincon
[0:26:10] <%Ranryu692> Guys, stop telling her Pat isn't real. We don't want her to relapse again
[0:26:10] <@commanderclaw> Pat is the ghost of thicc bois
[0:26:13] <+SciFiBrony> You don't dream about him because he IS already your dream man
[0:26:14] <mike2hands> Even dream pat is line fuck this
[0:26:14] <%TigerCatGo> OR A SPOOKY SKELETON GHOST
[0:26:15] <dynamitedoki> one time I had a dream about spinning objects in a bowl. and the next day someone brought battle tops to school that looked exactly the same and I had an actual panic attack

[0:26:22] <JoeStillLife> Pat is just a cloud of gas
[0:26:22] <%JaydenSai> Is Pat a Muppet? @PeachSaliva
[0:26:23] <+MayorRev> where's our guest of the evening?
[0:26:23] <+Taisuru> If Pat showed up in your dream he'd just call it bullshit and you'd wake up LUL
[0:26:27] <+Fooguwu> nightmares, for babies!

[0:28:00] <Zeif00> The bees can't be mad if you eat them all Kappa
[0:28:00] <Valdorick> Dream Facts - You can hit the bottom, you can feel pain in dreams, and dying in the dream does not kill you in real life.
[0:28:00] <jetpack_rorschasch> SeemsGood
[0:28:01] <%SilverJakler> A BeeLT
[0:28:01] <$cade_calrayn> So I'm guessing the Bee Movie is traumatic to you
[0:28:01] <%MisterRockett> Do you think if you had another dream where Scrooge McDuck offered you another sandwhich dream you would trust it?
[0:28:01] <NeroInfinite> -2
[0:28:02] <$feralspidey> Bee Nut Butter... you mean honey?
[0:28:05] <%ThomasOfTroy> God, at least the hamburger worms were because of your mom and not dreams
[0:28:05] <Oxybe> Beenut Butter! LUL
[0:28:05] <kasteni> But mold is A-ok
[0:28:06] <$TrashLeviathan> bee nut LUL
[0:28:07] <+YoSoyConando89> You should have KNOWN Scrooge doesn't do hand outs!
[0:28:09] <%SilverJakler> the L and T are also bees
[0:28:11] <skyentombment> BEE SANDWICH EATING STREAM WHEN?
[0:28:11] <%Chichen> ?????
[0:28:13] <DrkJP520> I recently dreamed I was observing a torture. It was awful and I couldn't do anything. felt like shit the whole day
[0:28:14] <lildaddybree99> you should be scared
[0:28:16] <$AzureGale> All my nightmares are just of me being late to class
[0:28:16] <$JoshManVGH> Why was Scrooge McDuck so cruel?
[0:28:17] <%CommanderSqueaks> Peach, do you get mad at people for things they do in your dreams?
[0:28:18] <@MelBrooksKA> Why crunchy peanut butter and not Scroug?
[0:28:19] <Jaysky> I ate a cheese stick in a dream where all the stringy cheese I was eating turned to someones hair
[0:28:20] <Ziegsy> I just got WILD deja vu
[0:28:20] <%Ranryu692> What
[0:28:24] <GrizzMango> What sorts of "other things"
[0:28:26] <+fromnibelheim> I saw another version of myself in a dream once and she turned and looked me dead in the eye and I was so freaked out I woke up in a cold sweat
[0:28:26] <hearingthenseeing> Paige the bee sandwich isn't real, it can't hurt you
[0:28:29] <$feralspidey> that's oddly specific
[0:28:30] <%Ranryu692> He's offered you "other things?"
[0:28:31] <Madovir> how do you manage to simultaneously be the most interesting AND most boring person with these weird ass non-nightmares
[0:28:32] <person181> maybe it's a metaphore
[0:28:32] <+Fooguwu> Paige has wet dreams where she eats the mold
[0:28:32] <thebalticguy1> Paige's fursona is SCROOGE MCDUCK
[0:28:33] <seycheles> D:
[0:28:33] <augusta_wind> no dreams about pat, but plenty about scrooge mcduck
[0:28:33] <Valdorick> Because Pat = Scrooge?
[0:28:34] <$JoshManVGH> Are you sure it wasn't Glomgold in disguise?
[0:28:37] <Case_Ah_Dia> isn't beenut just honey
[0:28:38] <Oxybe> Scrooge is a capitalist duck. of course one should be wary of him!
[0:28:43] <lildaddybree99> he is obviously out to ruin your life
[0:28:44] <+patriotrenegade> its the money
[0:28:47] <$TrashLeviathan> why does scrouge mcduck offer you things ,but not me

[0:45:34] <$shurtal> Garrus has reach if you have flexibility
[0:45:35] <@commanderclaw> IIRC there's one in the DLC, they look similar but not the same

[0:47:18] <AlFredo_Taken> NotLikeThis NotLikeThis

[0:47:36] <PinoProxie> @SilverJakler get out nomura
[0:47:40] <ChaosedStar> they feel like a crusty dry heel.
[0:47:43] <NeroInfinite> This is a corsed stream.
[0:47:48] <anAngryHamster> I stepped out for a bit, who's mandible are they talking about?
[0:47:50] <JanusII> Please do not go in space towards the sun.
[0:47:52] <NeroInfinite> cursed too.

[0:48:57] <%CopperTucker> This is on you Paige
[0:49:03] <augusta_wind> you're right eli
[0:49:04] <Jodoxk1> This is Plague's house you go away :P
[0:49:05] <%walternatorz> Plague is so right on this.
[0:49:05] <%CommanderSqueaks> PLAGUE IS THE MOST RIGHT
[0:49:06] <Madovir> Plague is right
[0:49:08] <+goose_attack_almanac> Paige am wrong
[0:49:08] <zerointelligence000> plague is based
[0:49:09] <%Ranryu692> Eli is super right
[0:49:11] <YakumoYomi> Eli is so right
[0:49:11] <+Kindan55> he is obviously right
[0:49:14] <kazadog> ok paige we wont tell him youre right
[0:49:18] <+Nymphonomicon> Mr. The Plague.
[0:49:18] <Valdorick> They're REALLY bad
[0:49:20] <DeltaPangaea> I just got here and have no context but Plague is probably right.
[0:49:24] <ChaosedStar> they are messy
[0:49:27] <+McSoliace> he's unshockingly right
[0:49:32] <Valdorick> Yes
[0:49:33] <+Nymphonomicon> It's all the Macksauce.
[0:49:35] <@commanderclaw> We hear your jaw unhinge as you consume the live gerbil
[0:49:36] <%walternatorz> Paige, are you attempting to remove the patties from a Big Mac?
[0:49:36] <Antioch_Aldo> big macs like 90% bread lol
[0:49:36] <%zamatermort> Eli is the most right
[0:49:38] <crimeagentalpha> It’s impossible to see how Plague is wrong here.
[0:49:42] <VentWilsn> Plague MVP
[0:49:43] <+NickNackProductions> nooooooo staph
[0:49:44] <$rdark_ksu> Never got the hype for big mac
[0:49:44] <+SciFiBrony> Eli is correct. Plus it's his house!!!
[0:49:45] <$NitronStreams> big macs are 50% sauce and lettuce
[0:49:49] <fritz_dacat> Nah
[0:49:52] <$hrbeck_> I can hear you talking with food in your mouth
[0:49:54] <$Puhff> I still don't know who the guest is
[0:49:55] <lildaddybree99> thank god i csnt hear it
[0:49:55] <VentWilsn> the m in mac stands for mess
[0:49:55] <+Nymphonomicon> I didn't hear no clicks.
[0:49:57] <Laecerelius> Paige is like that guy in the snake burger ad
[0:50:03] <Laioken13> i hate eating soudns too
[0:50:03] <Valdorick> That's right
[0:50:05] <%Ranryu692> we'll stop when he stops being rihgt
[0:50:05] <Rionxgarland> eli is right
[0:50:09] <Kiraklene> Eli is SUPER right
[0:50:09] <PinoProxie> ELI IS RIGHT
[0:50:13] <anAngryHamster> McDonald's may be garbage but it gave us Mac n Me so all is forgiven
[0:50:13] <$cade_calrayn> I don't know what Eli's right about but he's right
[0:50:15] <lildaddybree99> eli isnt welcome
[0:50:15] <CzeekyTV> @NitronStreams and 80% bread
[0:50:18] <+Nymphonomicon> The Right of Eli.
[0:50:18] <ChaosedStar> Eli is right AND you are wrong
[0:50:21] <JanusII> Paige was very polite.
[0:50:23] <+Taisuru> Eli grows .5% every time he's told he's right
[0:50:24] <%CommanderSqueaks> Eli is the rightest he's ever been.
[0:50:40] <VentWilsn> didnt realize i tuned in to the book of Eli Kappa
[0:50:53] <ChaosedStar> big macs are mainly about the sauce lettuce
[0:50:53] <$Puhff> it has one extra piece of bread and suddenly it's 80%
[0:51:00] <+MrAtheGreat> I like bread!
[0:51:00] <CzeekyTV> yes
[0:51:05] <%CommanderSqueaks> The answer lies in the heart of battle
[0:51:06] <lildaddybree99> Mcdouble. McDouble! MCDOUBLE
[0:51:06] <CzeekyTV> but it's bad bread :(
[0:51:06] <Antioch_Aldo> just get a double quarter pounder with cheese
[0:51:14] <%walternatorz> THINK, PAIGE. THINK.
[0:51:30] <+SciFiBrony> Paige doesn't like to eat bread. Only ham!
[0:51:30] <+Nymphonomicon> If a Big Mac is 80% bread because it has an extra slice, how much percentage is a normal sandwich, Paige? 60%?
[0:51:38] <+ThatGuyfromMars> i will eat bread until the day i die
[0:51:40] <sosuke5> scandalous
[0:51:41] <lildaddybree99> No spoily pls
[0:51:43] <zerointelligence000> It's "No, luke" all over again
[0:51:55] <freelancebabymaker> no spoil
[0:52:14] <%CommanderSqueaks> Peach why do you know what Plague's butthole smells like?
[0:52:15] <DeltaPangaea> It's not a stink, it's a MUSK
[0:52:15] <+Taisuru> Does his butthole stink good?
[0:52:17] <$cade_calrayn> Paige... how do you know how his butthole smells
[0:52:17] <lildaddybree99> we all smelled him come in
[0:52:19] <+Kindan55> now Paige is right
[0:52:21] <%zamatermort> Stinky Eli
[0:52:24] <Psyramics> also its like midnight here, good night paige
[0:52:27] <%CopperTucker> It's how Eli attracts a mate
[0:52:28] <CzeekyTV> look up a picture of a big mac and tell me "this burger is nowhere near 80% bread"
[0:52:36] <+D00msDayDan> i just got back, they haven't played a single match yet have they?

[0:54:17] <+Kindan55> from the office???
[0:54:17] <Valdorick> Peach "Removes everything from the meat" Salvia says she's too lazy to remove the middle of a bigmac.
[0:54:30] <+Nymphonomicon> I forget, is 11 a ginger or am I mistaking her for Bev?
[0:54:41] <$hrbeck_> She checked for worms, right?
[0:54:45] <bevyrage> bev?
[0:54:47] <+necrocannibal2> this game loads a lot
[0:54:47] <Dakuu75> Jinxed
[0:54:52] <bevyrage> someone say my name?
[0:54:59] <%Chichen> did you check for them on the fish filet sandwich?
[0:55:04] <%Ranryu692> @D00msDayDan she was in queue for most of it tbf
[0:55:04] <%CommanderSqueaks> And checking for mold.
[0:55:13] <%CommanderSqueaks> PLAGUE STOP
[0:55:15] <ChaosedStar> Bees are good proteins tho
[0:55:17] <%CommanderSqueaks> PLAGUE WHAT ARE YOU DOING

[0:55:18] <%Chichen> monkaS
[0:55:20] <lKaleidoscopel> spite
[0:55:20] <Sol_Install> WHAT
[0:55:21] <+colouroftheiris77> DBD being slowwwwwwwww
[0:55:22] <+Nymphonomicon> I was asking if 11 or Beverly from It Remake are gingers. @bevyrage
[0:55:23] <Sol_Install> NO
[0:55:24] <Valdorick> "it happens"
[0:55:24] <Madovir> his parents tried to kill him
[0:55:29] <lildaddybree99> at school
[0:55:30] <Sol_Install> "It happens' DOESN'T PASS
[0:55:32] <Oxybe> I know Paige is talking about the DbD Dwight, but my monke brain defaults to The Office's Dwight and i kinda want to see a crossover in the properties
[0:55:33] <Samex_Comex> That's one crazy happy meal toy
[0:55:33] <%CommanderSqueaks> Oh great, Peach has a new phobia now.
[0:55:34] <PartyFavors> bathroom time
[0:55:34] <wolfen091> hey plague found internet somewhere in his corn field
[0:55:35] <+Kindan55> In Australia there were people putting razors into strawberries in supermarkets
[0:55:36] <$hrbeck_> Why would there be worms?
[0:55:37] <$NitronStreams> human being are fuck up paige you know this
[0:55:42] <+Nymphonomicon> The bees that shoot out razos when they bark.
[0:55:43] <Dunmarkh> based lunchlady
[0:55:43] <$Puhff> pls turn plague up
[0:55:46] <VentWilsn> WHAT ABOUT BEE-WORMS
[0:55:46] <NeroInfinite> How the fu-
[0:55:46] <bevyrage> @Nymphonomicon yeah she's ginger in the remake
[0:55:49] <%Ranryu692> just don't eat school cafeteria mashed potatoes and you'll be fine
[0:55:51] <Dakuu75> Mashed tates are ruined now
[0:55:53] <Jetsfantasy> Oh boy, another fear to add to her food checklist
[0:56:07] <Shion963> This is why you stir first
[0:56:10] <+SteamyLinguini64> Very sharp cheddar maybe?
[0:56:14] <NeroInfinite> At least it'll stop her from eating mould
[0:56:24] <+Nymphonomicon> @bevyrage It occurred to me that I might be mixing up the characters because I'm pretty sure both characters are the same actress...
[0:56:25] <SirCold_> Now combine them into worm noodles topped with bees and razor blades
[0:56:33] <+sc0rezer0> Is eli downloading porn on the wifi? Kappa.
[0:56:35] <+Nymphonomicon> Stop all the downloading! I'm a computer!
[0:56:39] <$hrbeck_> Always check for worm, never look for mold
[0:56:40] <+MrAtheGreat> That's bravery right there jumping onto stairs from that height
[0:57:04] <+MrAtheGreat> Pre-Johns are strong johns indeed
[0:57:08] <$Puhff> @PeachSaliva since you can't romance Garrus in ME1, who will you be spilling paint with instead?
[0:57:19] <bevyrage> y'know what i'll look into it
[0:57:28] <+necrocannibal2> is Paige going to play ME?
[0:57:46] <+pabloelenano2> or wraith
[0:57:46] <+Nymphonomicon> The killer brought you a Big Mac Paige. Eat up and die.
[0:57:58] <$NitronStreams> I have to say Background Heckler Plague is one of my favorite forms of Plague
[0:58:02] <Dakuu75> did the hud change? I don't remember seeing all the player's portraits
[0:58:15] <Samex_Comex> Plague became a ghost after the Game Grumps animation
[0:58:39] <$TrashLeviathan> plague was always a ghost
[0:58:50] <$TrashLeviathan> plague was born a ghost
[0:58:51] <Rionxgarland> plauge is ghost?
[0:58:55] <+Nymphonomicon> I need the Plague theme song back in my life. I am still mad about it being taken down.
[0:59:02] <Dakuu75> a six dimensional ghost
[0:59:07] <%CommanderSqueaks> I like how Peach is just effortlessly singing amazingly while trying not to get stabified.
[0:59:13] <$TrashLeviathan> plague is the ghost of abraham lincoln
[0:59:15] <Samex_Comex> The one from the RPG?
[0:59:19] <bevyrage> @Nymphonomicon alright so 11 is Maddie Bobby Brown, and Beverly is Sophia Lillis
[0:59:20] <Rionxgarland> and baba is you
[0:59:35] <$AzureGale> LUL
[0:59:36] <CzeekyTV> @CommanderSqueaks the fear really brings out the dulcet tones
[0:59:54] <%CommanderSqueaks> Fear singing is the worst debuff to have in a horror game.
[0:59:59] <BurningLlama777> This game is so fun.
[1:00:00] <CzeekyTV> LUL
[1:00:09] <+necrocannibal2> wait, this is a Silent Hill map
[1:00:10] <$AzureGale> If the killer is John Cena you will never see him
[1:00:13] <+necrocannibal2> only realized it now
[1:00:22] <weissguard> LUL
[1:00:22] <Oxybe> but ur wearing jeans...
[1:00:24] <Dunmarkh> LUL
[1:00:24] <Truinz25> LUL
[1:00:25] <+Taisuru> He was charging up lol
[1:00:27] <CzeekyTV> Must have been the keyboard
[1:00:28] <Valdorick> Paige why?
[1:00:29] <+MrAtheGreat> LUL that dude looked to you for  help and got nah'd
[1:00:29] <%CommanderSqueaks> That neutral game from Mike though.
[1:00:31] <+Nymphonomicon> @bevyrage I guess that's my fault, I haven't actually seen Stranger Things. I just heard someone say the It Remake was a Stranger Things reunion.
[1:00:31] <%zamatermort> LUL
[1:00:39] <Rionxgarland> is plauge myers
[1:00:42] <+colouroftheiris77> He juked you out of your shorts
[1:00:43] <%CommanderSqueaks> HYUCK
[1:00:46] <$sekoshi> BANNED
[1:00:47] <$AzureGale> ew
[1:00:50] <bevyrage> it sorta is
[1:00:54] <Dunmarkh> @Rionxgarland not in the game
[1:00:57] <+Nymphonomicon> Michael, what are you doing in Silent Hill?
[1:01:03] <BurningLlama777> This Silent Hill map is clearly non-canon, everyone knows Michael Myers is James Sunderfield's monster.
[1:01:03] <%CommanderSqueaks> barrHyuck barrHyuck barrHyuck barrHyuck barrHyuck barrHyuck
[1:01:06] <bevyrage> though it came out while stranger things was running alongside the it remakes
[1:01:08] <+MrAtheGreat> okay Kappa
[1:01:09] <anAngryHamster> That whole album is a banger
[1:01:16] <$AzureGale> euphamisms
[1:01:17] <%AncelDeLambert> the Patton bit, yeah
[1:01:18] <%CommanderSqueaks> barrHyuck barrHyuck barrHyuck
[1:01:20] <+skoolie> clean swears
[1:01:27] <%Ranryu692> yeah that's a good one
[1:01:38] <Valdorick> Wait, is she saying goop or goof? Is this Goofy fucking?
[1:01:41] <Dakuu75> take a chance to escape?
[1:01:41] <atgithursdays> patton oswalt voices Happy!
[1:01:45] <$AzureGale> ded
[1:01:50] <%AncelDeLambert> fill your hoo-hah with goof juice
[1:01:56] <Rionxgarland> my fav patton bit is the vanilla sky one with his brother
[1:02:02] <$hrbeck_> Patton oswalt is getting some great projects rn
[1:02:05] <%RedPanda25> this looks like its gonna be a 1 hook game
[1:02:06] <%Chichen> Paige is playing Hooky
[1:02:17] <+Nymphonomicon> I like Hook by Blues Traveler more than Patton Oswalt... and I don't like Hook by Blues Traveler.
[1:02:25] <$AzureGale> I thought you folks were talking about the Hook film
[1:02:26] <%AncelDeLambert> "You go up into heaven and they serve pie." "FUCK YOU IT'S CAKE!!"
[1:02:40] <boatzndhoez> isnt plague playing with her :O ?
[1:02:40] <%RedPanda25> you ran to the same dead end @peachsaliva
[1:02:44] <%CommanderSqueaks> Plague, I made a Powershell script that does that automatically, had to for work.
[1:02:53] <$AzureGale> WELP
[1:03:18] <sosuke5> Just do a Woolie and NEVER update until the computer shits itself because you never update it
[1:03:25] <BurningLlama777> Huh.  This is kind of an exponential Michael Myers.  Started slow but now, hoo boy.
[1:03:27] <+MrAtheGreat> HERO PAIGE
[1:03:28] <TonberryLives> HESITATION IS DEFEAT
[1:03:30] <CzeekyTV> Isn't a killer supposed to... kill? Everyone?
[1:03:32] <Valdorick> What a hook camping bitch
[1:03:44] <Dunmarkh> play to win gamer
[1:03:50] <BurningLlama777> What a Crystal Lake camper
[1:03:50] <+NickNackProductions> should've had bt Kappa
[1:03:53] <+Nymphonomicon> Campers are the bane of online games.
[1:03:57] <%CommanderSqueaks> Oh god now I remembered why I stopped playing multiplayer games, people get upset at you for winning.
[1:03:59] <Valdorick> Shit that's good, Burning.
[1:03:59] <%SveriSageAdvice> this dude's score at the end of the match is gonna suck ass lol
[1:04:04] <carlosmanriquez> Eli's a bit low isn't  he?
[1:04:12] <ChaosedStar> sorry if i am wrong i havent layed this, but would that not be the ideal way to play as a killer?
[1:04:17] <Dunmarkh> @carlosmanriquez he doesn't have a mic
[1:04:20] <CalderGaming> yes but this game is poorly designed so he's ~unsportsmanlike~
[1:04:22] <TonberryLives> LUL
[1:04:24] <%CommanderSqueaks> @ChaosedStar It is, but it's not 'exciting' so people get mad.
[1:04:29] <CzeekyTV> @CommanderSqueaks all I ever see of DBD streams are people shitting on the killer for winning, or they are steamrolling the killer
[1:04:37] <Dakuu75> YOUR IN THE SAME ROOM?!
[1:04:39] <+Nymphonomicon> If anyone says camping is a legitimate strategy, they deserve to banished to the Shadow Realm... by a firing squad.
[1:04:45] <carlosmanriquez> ohhhh you're together? that's so nice!
[1:04:45] <%SveriSageAdvice> @ChaosedStar actually no, you get way more points for being a typical horror movie killer and giving the victims a chance to get away
[1:04:47] <%CommanderSqueaks> @CommanderSqueaks Exactly, which is why if I DID play DBD, I'd never enable voice chat.
[1:04:50] <$TheNewZealandStory> @ChaosedStar it's a good strategy when you're not keeping up, people just like to whine
[1:04:51] <Dakuu75> (does it smell like farm?)
[1:04:55] <+necrocannibal2> it needs some rebalancing
[1:05:14] <ChaosedStar> ahhhh okay thanks guys
[1:05:21] <CzeekyTV> Playing to win should always be fun in a competitive game, this sounds like DBD is kinda failing
[1:05:35] <ChaosedStar> so its kinda like how people call zoning in fighting games "Spamming"
[1:05:42] <$TheNewZealandStory> the last killer they released is built entirely around camping for some reason
[1:05:54] <%CommanderSqueaks> @ChaosedStar Exactly.
[1:06:06] <%DooWopShaBop> HOW CAN THAT BE?
[1:06:10] <Zeif00> What rank is Eli?
[1:06:15] <BurningLlama777> I like Big Macs...
[1:06:16] <+necrocannibal2> Big Macs are awesome
[1:06:21] <%CommanderSqueaks> Zoners are grapplers are the eternal punching bag from internet scrublords.
[1:06:23] <carlosmanriquez> the echo would be pretty wild i think
[1:06:26] <%CommanderSqueaks> **Zoners and grapplers
[1:06:28] <BurningLlama777> @necrocannibal2 *high fives*
[1:06:34] <+Kindan55> Is Eli better at the game then you?
[1:06:42] <%superc37> what? no hes not
[1:06:42] <@PatStaresAt> oh check it out
[1:06:44] <+Taisuru> No, he's not
[1:06:44] <+NickNackProductions> i think they're referrring to the twins
[1:06:45] <@PatStaresAt> its the smelly crew
[1:06:45] <+pabloelenano2> trickster... not really his power sucks
[1:06:46] <$AzureGale> Like game camping or actual camping
[1:06:46] <@PatStaresAt> stinky
[1:06:48] <sosuke5> Or like you constantly take 'damage' when you're in the room. Get sent to the room too many times and you die permenantly
[1:06:50] <$TheNewZealandStory> sorry i meant the twins, i forgot about the trickster
[1:06:52] <ashenfrenzy> think they meant the twins
[1:06:53] <$ChubbyPencil> they are thinking about the twins and still no
[1:06:55] <%superc37> hes too dogshit to be built around camping lol
[1:06:56] <%CommanderSqueaks> Hey, it's the final member of the stunky crew
[1:06:58] <TonberryLives> PSA PSA PSA
[1:07:02] <Dakuu75> Pat, 1-Orb Raid
[1:07:03] <%SveriSageAdvice> i guess the best fighting game analogy for a killer camping the hooks is a Guilty Gear player spamming block and not actually fighting because they're waiting for an opportunity to just use an Instant Kill @ChaosedStar
[1:07:06] <$NitronStreams> Hey like its Pasta man
[1:07:08] <%CommanderSqueaks> The P in their name stands for "P'yeeeew"
[1:07:09] <ChaosedStar> @CommanderSqueaks mhm 100% its a very easy way to tell if someone doesn't have much exp or has a poor attitude.
[1:07:09] <Zeif00> Ok, those opinions make sense then
[1:07:12] <$TheNewZealandStory> the twins are built around camping, not the trickster. the trickster is built around being really weak and useless
[1:07:16] <+necrocannibal2> who
[1:07:20] <@PatStaresAt> hey stinkobabe
[1:07:23] <@PatStaresAt> and Paige
[1:07:25] <%AncelDeLambert> hello orb
[1:07:25] <RileyOMalley> Heyyy Pat
[1:07:28] <%CopperTucker> Hi Pat!

[1:07:36] <Valdorick> Pasta Aera
[1:07:37] <%superc37> i mean even then its not rly tru since camping with the twins is difficult
[1:07:37] <CzeekyTV> @SveriSageAdvice isn't that super counterable in fighting games though? and is camping counterable here?
[1:07:37] <+Wade_Willson> psaUp psaUp psaUp psaUp
[1:07:38] <Valdorick> s
[1:07:38] <$cade_calrayn> PastaRaid
[1:07:39] <+MrAtheGreat> YEAH PASTA!!!!
[1:07:39] <SirCold_> G'day Pat
[1:07:40] <%s_xylocalsingles> the man with only two pieces of merch :)
[1:07:41] <chron121> man I've watched like, 3 episodes of yuyu hakusho on my other monitor and she
[1:07:41] <%CommanderSqueaks> Pizza pasta.
[1:07:42] <hairtoday> pasta rat!
[1:07:42] <Srthunda> does pat even like pasta
[1:07:42] <JanusII> Pasta@
[1:07:43] <@PatStaresAt> Paste Areolasa
[1:07:46] <+Nymphonomicon> Arms Spaghetti.
[1:07:52] <ChaosedStar> what can a killer do other than like kill the survivors tho
[1:07:52] <danknugglit> LUL
[1:07:52] <$ChubbyPencil> twins are more built about dead zoning loops than camping but ok go off
[1:07:55] <Arancet> orby and his amazing garbage eating dog
[1:07:57] <$AzureGale> LUL
[1:07:59] <$Scarnehu> knees weak
[1:07:59] <$Puhff> oh hey patricia
[1:07:59] <akarchives> Is Plague actually allowed to play DbD today
[1:08:00] <+MrAtheGreat> YEAH PASTE
[1:08:04] <aiutare47> Really?
[1:08:13] <$Puhff> enjoying my money?
[1:08:16] <BurningLlama777> napaste
[1:08:16] <chron121> still in the pre-game, huh?
[1:08:17] <%CommanderSqueaks> Man, Plague is so stinky Pat can smell him from Canada?
[1:08:19] <+Taisuru> It's just that stinky
[1:08:22] <%SveriSageAdvice> @czeekytv there is a counterable way, and its to not interact with the hooks if you can tell the killer is camping the hooks
[1:08:28] <jetpack_rorschasch> StinkyGlitch StinkyGlitch StinkyGlitch
[1:08:29] <$Scarnehu> what's with the frame rate on the camp fire?
[1:08:29] <%TheWinged7> and yet he can still smell your butt all the way from Quebec
[1:08:33] <ChaosedStar> they'd totally make out
[1:08:34] <$TheNewZealandStory> @SveriSageAdvice camping is counterable by just finishing gens and leaving, but if the killer has two hooked survivors right next to each other, they dont have much reason to leave
[1:08:35] <danknugglit> You can smell it for miles
[1:08:38] <@PatStaresAt> Im gunna go take a huge dump and take a big shower, I just got my butt kicked by the gang in Project Winter
[1:08:39] <@PatStaresAt> you two have fun'
[1:08:41] <carlosmanriquez> it would be too hot if they were together in the same room
[1:08:42] <Case_Ah_Dia> Eli stinky CONFIRMED???
[1:08:46] <lildaddybree99> eli gonna be baffled by how short that man is at the wedding
[1:09:03] <$AzureGale> 15 FPS
[1:09:12] <@PatStaresAt> luv u bb big times
[1:09:13] <$AzureGale> Pat plays Project Winter?
[1:09:16] <%CommanderSqueaks> Awwwwwwwww
[1:09:17] <BurningLlama777> Have a nice movement Pat.
[1:09:29] <%zamatermort> Bye Pat, have a good shit
[1:09:36] <%SveriSageAdvice> @TheNewZealandStory wait, the game doesnt punish the killer for just hooking two survivors and just standing there the whole time??
[1:09:40] <RileyOMalley> the man is shorter than even ME
[1:09:49] <Kon_zetsu> Man, what did i come in on XD
[1:09:51] <akarchives> @SveriSageAdvice You get a penalty for "Proximity to Hooked Survivors"
[1:09:55] <%CommanderSqueaks> Critical dumpage.
[1:09:56] <+necrocannibal2> I'm just glad there are people shorter than me out there
[1:09:58] <SaphronBlackbourne> I think I'm an inch shorter than Pat
[1:10:02] <$ChubbyPencil> @sverisageadvice it does by killing any points they would be earning
[1:10:04] <+pabloelenano2> @SveriSageAdvice  yes and not.. in high ranks you depip wich means you go ranks down
[1:10:05] <Oxybe> as a shot French Canadian myself i dout i would be surprised
[1:10:08] <amused_platypus> is that plaguesama
[1:10:11] <%SveriSageAdvice> @akarchives thank you
[1:10:14] <@SoFarFetched> yeah people play WAY more survivor
[1:10:15] <$TheNewZealandStory> @SveriSageAdvice No, not really. there's not reason to punish the killer for survivors making a bad play
[1:10:22] <+Nymphonomicon> Why does Kate look like that one Until Dawn character?
[1:10:32] <%CommanderSqueaks> @SoFarFetched Which is baffling for an outsider, I'd think everyone would want to play killer.
[1:10:33] <BurningLlama777> @amused_platypus They're actually showing off an AI they trained on Plague's audio.
[1:10:46] <RileyOMalley> I'm 5'3", I'm between ya'll
[1:10:53] <+necrocannibal2> how much is that in units that make sense
[1:10:55] <$TheNewZealandStory> @SoFarFetched killer is a lot more stressful to play
[1:10:55] <%CommanderSqueaks> 5'8" crew represent.
[1:10:56] <akarchives> how the fuck am I taller than most of the Zaibatsu
[1:10:57] <sosuke5> King of manlet height
[1:10:58] <%SveriSageAdvice> @ChubbyPencil i knew about it, but was not sure if that had changed for any reason
[1:11:00] <akarchives> That feels weird
[1:11:02] <Oxybe> 58 on a good day
[1:11:03] <lildaddybree99> my aunt is 4'11"
[1:11:03] <Samex_Comex> Haha I'm taller then Plague
[1:11:05] <SaphronBlackbourne> I'm 5'1"
[1:11:08] <+pabloelenano2> @commanderclaw  not really cuz killers tend to play vs a lot of groups in coms which is pretty hard
[1:11:09] <@SoFarFetched> @CommanderSqueaks People dont like the stress of playing Killers because of how people can be
[1:11:14] <augusta_wind> 5'10 is the only valid height
[1:11:14] <wolfen091> spider eli drawing when
[1:11:15] <anAngryHamster> Inverse Pat
[1:11:15] <aiutare47> I keep forgetting that Paige isn’t actually tall it’s just in comparison to Pat who’s abnormally tiny. It’s like living in a dollhouse.
[1:11:18] <+Kindan55> I just think of him as another pat
[1:11:21] <@SoFarFetched> @TheNewZealandStory yeah it sucks that killer is a stressful job because of how people can act like.
[1:11:24] <%CommanderSqueaks> @SoFarFetched As in how they behave in chat or how they play?
[1:11:26] <amused_platypus> @BurningLlama777 the wonders of technology
[1:11:31] <$NitronStreams> Taller than Pat Gang aka most people on the planet
[1:11:31] <$TheNewZealandStory> @SoFarFetched both
[1:11:39] <+pabloelenano2> @commanderclaw  how they play
[1:11:40] <akarchives> @SoFarFetched I enjoy the gameplay but I can only ever play two or three games at a time before I'm too stressed to continue
[1:11:44] <%CommanderSqueaks> I think I know exactly one person who is shorter than Pat.
[1:11:45] <@SoFarFetched> @CommanderSqueaks Survivors will berate you for being a shit killer and will berate you for killing them.
[1:11:49] <karovus> wow i cant believe im taller than both the gingers
[1:11:54] <atgithursdays> @peachsaliva have you done the us weed yet?
[1:11:59] <lildaddybree99> i remember i thought paige was tall for a long time until my fiance explained its just becausw pat is tiny
[1:12:01] <@SoFarFetched> Survivors get weird geefShrug
[1:12:08] <@SoFarFetched> as someone who plays both Killer and Survivor
[1:12:11] <%CommanderSqueaks> @SoFarFetched So if you just completely ignore chat, Killer is kinda fun? I wonder if you can get a mod or somehow disable chat completely.
[1:12:28] <+Nymphonomicon> I'm pretty sure if polled, 80% of chat is taller than Pat and Paige?
[1:12:32] <RileyOMalley> I suggest Purple Punch
[1:12:33] <maharielves> paige we missed you!
[1:12:41] <@SoFarFetched> @CommanderSqueaks well also how they can play in game,they can loop you,teabag and what not. But yeah you can skip aftergame chat.
[1:12:43] <+pabloelenano2> @commanderclaw  nah in game people try the hardest to makethe game unplayable for you
[1:12:50] <+Kindan55> Plague probably grows it himself
[1:12:54] <%TheWinged7> didn't know Eli was immune to the we'd e
[1:12:55] <+Axellogic> Who are you
[1:13:04] <akarchives> @Kindan55 what do you think The Fence is for
[1:13:06] <%CommanderSqueaks> @SoFarFetched Yup, yeah okay. Everything that pretty much got me to stop playing multiplayer games with random people.
[1:13:14] <%Ranryu692> She never said she was GOOD at hustlin
[1:13:41] <+pabloelenano2> @commanderclaw
[1:13:42] <BurningLlama777> @CommanderSqueaks I genuinely don't see the appeal of online multiplayer for this reason.
[1:13:51] <%DooWopShaBop> Try moon rocks then. weed covered in has and kief
[1:14:02] <Rionxgarland> is that plauge next to paige in the game
[1:14:05] <+pabloelenano2> @CommanderSqueaks  there are good games online with randoms
[1:14:05] <%CommanderSqueaks> @BurningLlama777 Online play with people you KNOW is great, PUGs are completely useless and are nothing, but stress.
[1:14:06] <Dakuu75> sstream pausing for other ppl too?
[1:14:07] <Kon_zetsu> That lag hitting i see
[1:14:08] <lildaddybree99> this stream is keeping me sane while I struggle not to have anxiety bout my final grades before becoming a ChemE
[1:14:18] <BurningLlama777> @CommanderSqueaks Agreed.
[1:14:20] <Kon_zetsu> konF
[1:14:31] <Rionxgarland> yeah dak
[1:14:31] <%DooWopShaBop> frames
[1:14:32] <$NitronStreams> Im enjoying the slideshow
[1:14:32] <akarchives> @lildaddybree99 one STEM major to another best of luck to you
[1:14:36] <%CommanderSqueaks> Wait, crouch can't be set as a toggle in DBD?!
[1:14:37] <Dunmarkh> @Dakuu75 yeah, farm internet bad probably
[1:14:39] <+necrocannibal2> king crimson
[1:14:45] <VentWilsn> the stream cant handle plague's truths
[1:14:45] <+Kindan55> Steam is useful for that
[1:14:48] <$hrbeck_> PS1
[1:14:58] <$NitronStreams> 5fps stream lets go!
[1:15:00] <Dementedpenguin> As long as I can hear Paige and Eli, I'm fine.
[1:15:11] <deathygz> is this DBD mobile?
[1:15:12] <%Ranryu692> was that the Real Man's World?
[1:15:19] <clockworkidiot> this is like my internet
[1:15:21] <%CommanderSqueaks> Man, I didn't know DBD had a mobile version
[1:15:24] <lildaddybree99> @akarchives thanks. im ready to get out of college.
[1:15:30] <%DooWopShaBop> I thought ELi had terrible internet
[1:15:32] <+necrocannibal2> Switch version
[1:15:35] <deathygz> @CommanderSqueaks its rough
[1:15:35] <amused_platypus> scrooge mcduck as a skin nice
[1:15:45] <%barkon345> @PeachSaliva how long are you in the states for?
[1:15:56] <@SoFarFetched> @CommanderSqueaks mobile version has more handicaps on things and the system is different on getting perks
[1:16:04] <%CommanderSqueaks> Diablo 2 on Dial Up let's fucking goo.
[1:16:06] <+Nymphonomicon> Kinda like how my wireless drops periodically, it just had a drop a minute ago.
[1:16:13] <%DooWopShaBop> I played RuneScape on dial-up
[1:16:17] <+MrAtheGreat> We all thought Eli had bad internety, but it turns out Eli makes internet bad with his space beliefs\
[1:16:18] <Dakuu75> Plague uses wifi? where's the ethernet cables, bruh
[1:16:18] <%CommanderSqueaks> @SoFarFetched Wait I was joking about the bad framerate, there really is a mobile version?
[1:16:22] <akarchives> @lildaddybree99 4 more years to finish my PhD :pepeHands:
[1:16:28] <%Ranryu692> @DooWopShaBop he does, that's why he's using Paige's internet
[1:16:30] <remainprofane> @dakuu75 F
[1:16:32] <deathygz> i played mobile for a bit and the killer locks on to the survivor but its not helpful at all
[1:16:33] <@SoFarFetched> @CommanderSqueaks yeah there is a mobile version you can check out trailers for it.
[1:16:34] <%CommanderSqueaks> @Dakuu75 Ethernet cables only work for 100 meters, too far to reach the barn.
[1:16:36] <@SoFarFetched> and oh no the stream
[1:16:47] <$TheNewZealandStory> stream is farting and shitting
[1:16:59] <$NitronStreams> oof stream really dying now
[1:17:11] <deathygz> the stream got infected with weird farm internet
[1:17:12] <Zantetzuken> stream at risk
[1:17:12] <lildaddybree99> @akarchives I pursued chemical engineering specifically to only have to get a Bachelors
[1:17:14] <+colouroftheiris77> Stream struggling big time
[1:17:16] <deathygz> thanks gripes
[1:17:18] <Dunmarkh> the stream is shidding and cummin
[1:17:25] <+necrocannibal2> lag is psychological
[1:17:29] <%CommanderSqueaks> Peach is spoiled by the good internet.
[1:17:30] <TonberryLives> We'll just have to bear with it
[1:17:34] <+necrocannibal2> just ignore it and it will be fine
[1:17:36] <+MrAtheGreat> tell Eli to stop downloadingthose torrents
[1:17:42] <wolfen091> ah good ol 10fps
[1:17:44] <%Ranryu692> lag is an insanity effect
[1:17:45] <+SciFiBrony> To be fair she's playing a game AND streaming
[1:17:46] <VentWilsn> just think of it like the killer's hidden passive.... to kill ur connection
[1:17:51] <akarchives> tell Eli to stop *uploading* those torrents
[1:17:54] <deathygz> yeah if you close your eyes the lag goes away
[1:17:55] <TonberryLives> L

[1:23:11] <Dunmarkh> no.
[1:23:13] <@SoFarFetched> he saw your balls exposed
[1:23:13] <Arancet> no one thinks youre cool
[1:23:14] <BurningLlama777> Cone Seltzer, Peach is really cool.
[1:23:15] <$NitronStreams> You see Paige merely adapted to the lag. Eli was Born in it, Molded by it. He didnt see fiber until he was a man and by then it was nothing but blinding.
[1:23:15] <@SoFarFetched> COMPLETELY
[1:23:15] <%AncelDeLambert> Paige that would be a lie and therefore a sin

[1:24:17] <aiutare47> The cave?
[1:24:19] <Pookiedaexzile> Do you trust Paige for a 9 hour car ride
[1:24:19] <Arancet> would pat actually want to go to a cave?
[1:24:19] <+Nymphonomicon> That cave.
[1:24:27] <$NitronStreams> ??? are you plotting to murder Pat in a cave?
[1:24:29] <$Puhff> the fuck cave
[1:24:29] <ashenfrenzy> oh hell yeah Mammoth Cave is great
[1:24:29] <lildaddybree99> take smallest man to largest cave
[1:24:32] <+Nymphonomicon> Paige wants to play The Cave in real life.

[1:24:55] <$cade_calrayn> Paige, mapping?

[1:28:18] <%zamatermort> Paige, you ARE a pathetic loser
[1:28:18] <%Lunarhawk> Why did you aim for your brother and not the floor
[1:28:21] <fairore> wow
[1:28:22] <$NitronStreams> ...
[1:28:26] <Joem1k> Paige forgot to bring her bible and cross
[1:28:28] <%CommanderSqueaks> A ghost from space. A SPACE GHOST
[1:28:29] <%CommanderSqueaks> coast to coast
[1:28:29] <+Nymphonomicon> and bad smells.
[1:28:30] <BoxNavy> what a fuckin story
[1:28:36] <fairore> oh God
[1:28:44] <+superblar> I just got here, and I am glad I made it in time for Lincoln's ghost lmao
[1:28:46] <lildaddybree99> ghosts dont exist

[1:28:55] <Joem1k> LUL
[1:28:57] <%Ranryu692> at least something good came of it

[1:29:04] <+Nymphonomicon> Stay back, I have powers... Ruth Powers!
[1:29:05] <%DooWopShaBop> Licnoln's ghost, is this Venture Bros?
[1:29:10] <Joem1k> "I saw Abe Lincoln's ghost and threw up everywhere!"
[1:29:12] <PinoProxie> Nice
[1:29:15] <%CommanderSqueaks> Why is this story
[1:29:20] <aiutare47> This story never ceases to make me laugh my ass off. Everything about both the story and your delivery the first time kills me.
[1:29:22] <CalderGaming> fever dream is the missing detail here, iirc
[1:29:23] <BoxNavy> what an honor
[1:29:28] <PinoProxie> gravity threw up on your brother
[1:29:32] <Joem1k> two things i did not expect to hear after each other.
[1:29:36] <+CatastropheCorvid> Lincoln haunts Paige because he knew she'd defect to Canada.
[1:29:39] <wolfen091> @commandersqueaks you mean a "nighttime" ghost as paige doesn't believe in space
[1:29:40] <$UmoLoco> Woolie said something mean to Ghosts in a forest once
[1:29:40] <+MooseIsGoose> THE BEES
[1:29:46] <%CommanderSqueaks> Yes, because the Ghost of Abraham Lincoln felt compelled to bug a 6 year old.
[1:29:48] <BoxNavy> true
[1:29:51] <+Hilleltaco> Paige's dreams are actually prophecies
[1:29:51] <+VersenTheVassal> to free your slaves
[1:29:55] <Parapattern> Ghosts stole Woolie's spine
[1:29:59] <+MooseIsGoose> I have vomitted on bro as well I was on the top bunk
[1:30:04] <+necrocannibal2> they are
[1:30:09] <ZaverVT> Ok first thing I see is a baby, so I thought that was the special guest, but it turns out that was a commercial.
[1:30:14] <lildaddybree99> first stop paige
[1:30:14] <%CommanderSqueaks> Are we playing Peach phobia bingo?
[1:30:17] <fairore> man I hope woolie  feels better  so
[1:30:21] <Joem1k> Imagine Abe was just casually just floating around just looking around at people.
[1:30:23] <+MooseIsGoose> I was so sick
[1:30:27] <BoxNavy> monkaS
[1:30:28] <@SoFarFetched> Paige needed to understand the gravity of the situation geefPlz
[1:30:32] <NeroInfinite> monkaS
[1:30:35] <BurningLlama777> I saw the ghost of my sister as a kid.  She's still alive today though, so... figure that out.
[1:30:38] <Sotetsu> @sofarfetched LUL
[1:30:42] <BoxNavy> thats where lincolns ghost is
[1:30:45] <a_mad_dragon_> i slept on the top bunk for years with no problems
[1:30:46] <+necrocannibal2> I have a similar story but it's too disgusting to tell
[1:30:56] <+MooseIsGoose> Farts rise I think
[1:31:01] <fairore> @necrocannibal2 tell it anyway
[1:31:04] <%CommanderSqueaks> barrSqueent
[1:31:08] <Joem1k> Imagine someone wets the bed on the top bunk.
[1:31:10] <Sotetsu> How do you draw a fart?
[1:31:18] <weissguard> Bottom bunk rules if you toss and turn. Better in case you somehow fall off the edge.
[1:31:21] <%CommanderSqueaks> Fart is hot gas.
[1:31:21] <$NitronStreams> Bunkbeds are a trap
[1:31:24] <lildaddybree99> I want middle bunk
[1:31:26] <+necrocannibal2> yeah, top bunk. I vomited, noticed it was going to fall on my brother then slurped it all up.
[1:31:31] <%GraceTBM> I'd like to think that MOST people fart more than throw up
[1:31:38] <%CommanderSqueaks> Peach what the actual fuck
[1:31:40] <JanusII> Come my farts, rise for your master.
[1:31:47] <%DooWopShaBop> sipsipElmo
[1:31:48] <fairore> @necrocannibal2 ugh
[1:31:50] <Sotetsu> Ghost Cop
[1:31:53] <$NitronStreams> I only hear bad things about bunkbeds
[1:31:59] <Joem1k> Eli would then be confirmed a shape shifter.
[1:32:05] <Ziegsy> elmo the cat or a human sized elmo the muppet?
[1:32:08] <BoxNavy> elmo...
[1:32:12] <weissguard> What if Elmo Astral Projects himself?
[1:32:21] <@SoFarFetched> "Are you a god?" "Well..........no?" "THEN......DIEEEEEEEEE"
[1:32:23] <%CommanderSqueaks> Peach's Conceptualization skill is way too high.
[1:32:25] <PinoProxie> plague was elmo all along
[1:32:33] <BoxNavy> gief was doin fine on pats stream today
[1:32:40] <+MooseIsGoose> We had an old part of town and there was a restaurant that every one said was haunted like chairs moving and knifes falling from where they hung
[1:32:45] <lildaddybree99> legally must statw you are a ghost
[1:32:47] <NeroInfinite> "Are you a ghost?" "Meow"
[1:32:48] <Parapattern> And now back to the wall
[1:33:00] <%AncelDeLambert> well what's the schedule on you going home, Paige?
[1:33:16] <%Ranryu692> one of those ghost hunting shows wanted to check the apartment I grew up in for ghosts
[1:33:18] <%CommanderSqueaks> Plague
[1:33:19] <+Kindan55> He'll notice when you are back
[1:33:20] <%CommanderSqueaks> Stop
[1:33:20] <lildaddybree99> i can't wait to get a cat
[1:33:22] <%CommanderSqueaks> DESIST PLAGUE
[1:33:24] <BoxNavy> yeah
[1:33:26] <weissguard> psaDogchamp He seems to be just as happy and carefree as before the de-balling.
[1:33:27] <Sotetsu> There is a perk that shows you the three closest gens. fmgNERD
[1:33:29] <whittacre> a ball transplant!
[1:33:34] <NeroInfinite> Tormented ballsack. LUL
[1:33:36] <BoxNavy> have a more balls in the sac
[1:33:37] <+Nymphonomicon> Don't grief the Gief.
[1:33:43] <PinoProxie> his head is empty and now his ball sack is too
[1:33:47] <$NitronStreams> even if he did he cant do anything about it cuz he's a brick
[1:33:48] <+MoonObscure> lol
[1:33:50] <%CommanderSqueaks> Plague wants to be a Krogran, quad balls.
[1:33:52] <BurningLlama777> I once had a coworker that said he'd seen ghosts, UFOs and also smelled The Skunk Ape.  He was really going hard.  He was also like 6'9" and built, so that was fun to be trapped in a car with him.
[1:33:53] <Madovir> anglerfish mode
[1:33:53] <BoxNavy> but more
[1:33:55] <+MooseIsGoose> Think about how many balls
[1:34:01] <Sotetsu> Even two balls are too many
[1:34:02] <+KevinsLunchbox> Plague wants to be the main character of JoJo part 8
[1:34:04] <clockworkidiot> put them on your chin and become peter griffin
[1:34:06] <akarchives> imagine
[1:34:10] <%CommanderSqueaks> Oh the internet is having fun.
[1:34:11] <fairore> laggggg
[1:34:13] <Laecerelius> Plague wants a quad, Shepherd!!
[1:34:13] <%TheWinged7> Plague just wants to be Gappy
[1:34:15] <$AzureGale> FOUR BALLS
[1:34:19] <+necrocannibal2> I think you can do that
[1:34:20] <+Kindan55> THERE ARE 4 BALLS
[1:34:22] <PinoProxie> krogan balls
[1:34:25] <trickquestionz> You become JoJo Part 8
[1:34:26] <BoxNavy> more like playing with ass 😏
[1:34:27] <+Hilleltaco> now you're cooking with power
[1:34:32] <+Nymphonomicon> Wouldn't you need roomier underpants to cover all that?
[1:34:35] <TonberryLives> No. God no.
[1:34:40] <PinoProxie> FOUR BALLS PAIGE
[1:34:42] <+Sebenoth> sounds like what they did in aqua teen hunger force
[1:34:44] <%Ranryu692> remember that pee is stored in the balls as gas
[1:34:46] <%TheWinged7> Paige and her gas powered internet
[1:34:49] <PinoProxie> IMAGINE
[1:34:49] <NeroInfinite> Four balls because krogan
[1:34:53] <Ziegsy> Theres a dean koontz book where the villain is a villain because he has 8 balls and it makes him super mad
[1:34:53] <BoxNavy> i wanna do that
[1:35:02] <BoxNavy> i will do this in my home
[1:35:11] <+Nymphonomicon> Gas! Gas! Gas!
[1:35:12] <$NitronStreams> thats some good lag right there
[1:35:20] <aiutare47> Plague giving me redneck upbringing nostalgia
[1:35:21] <Samex_Comex> I like fire
[1:35:33] <BoxNavy> do it to spite the environment'
[1:35:34] <%CommanderSqueaks> I once lit my hand on fire with WD40, that was fun.
[1:35:38] <%Ranryu692> my neck is too untouched by the sun for that
[1:35:38] <+MooseIsGoose> Its toots cool
[1:35:40] <$NitronStreams> the mid west is scary
[1:35:43] <aiutare47> Making homemade fireworks was the best
[1:35:51] <%Ranryu692> like smoking
[1:35:52] <+KevinsLunchbox> cave man brain see fire and think cool
[1:35:58] <%Ranryu692> cigarettes are super cool
[1:35:59] <amused_platypus> some paiges just want to watch the world burn
[1:36:01] <+Nymphonomicon> I bet a milkjug would make for a great torch.
[1:36:02] <akarchives> @NitronStreams what are you telling me you're not raised with an innate need to set things on fire
[1:36:02] <$AzureGale> Winners don't do crimes
[1:36:03] <Zeif00> Fire activates monkey neuron
[1:36:12] <BurningLlama777> Captain Planet isn't real, but all the villains from the show are.  They just look different.
[1:36:16] <+necrocannibal2> I wanna do that
[1:36:18] <Arancet> thanks rich evans
[1:36:19] <%CommanderSqueaks> I had a ghetto ice cream truck on my block that sold legit smoke bombs. They were little orbs that created giant pillars of smoke.
[1:36:26] <+MooseIsGoose> Rachel
[1:36:37] <+necrocannibal2> I'll do it and tell them Paige made me do it
[1:36:37] <BoxNavy> richie
[1:36:46] <NeroInfinite> Fire is good for monkey brain
[1:36:58] <Sotetsu> Dickey Bushman
[1:37:00] <akarchives> HEY DICKIE YOU'RE SO FINE
[1:37:09] <+Nymphonomicon> My younger brother went into firefighting. I need to balance out the difference and give fire a fighting chance.
[1:37:13] <%CommanderSqueaks> I want somebody to just transcribe one of Peach's streams and present the text completely out of context.
[1:37:19] <BurningLlama777> Popsicles, smoke bombs and lockpicks
[1:37:36] <fairore> @nymphonomicon LUL
[1:37:43] <%CommanderSqueaks> @BurningLlama777 I think they did actually sold a baby shitty lockpick set. >.>
[1:37:58] <BurningLlama777> Holy crap XD
[1:38:16] <@SoFarFetched> context
[1:38:17] <akarchives> well the lag seems to have gotten better at least
[1:38:20] <akarchives> aaaaaand never mind
[1:38:24] <amused_platypus> applying that deep tissue
[1:38:24] <Valdorick> Bandages in your ass
[1:38:24] <%CommanderSqueaks> I lived in a very nice neighborhood to, we just had the ghettoist ice cream truck because they knew we were a bunch of bored middle class suburbanites.
[1:38:29] <+Nymphonomicon> Pyramid Head just comes sliding into frame like Bobby Iceman.
[1:38:39] <%Ranryu692> I hear a TON of tape
[1:38:40] <%CommanderSqueaks> Peach
[1:38:42] <%CommanderSqueaks> PEACH WHY
[1:38:48] <BoxNavy> that would kill you
[1:38:56] <+Nymphonomicon> Yuri.
[1:38:58] <Valdorick> "Let me Rub-berband"
[1:39:04] <@SoFarFetched> Paige you were saying gross things WAY before
[1:39:06] <BurningLlama777> Toffee Crunch: $0.75.  Anarchist's Cookbook: $4.99
[1:39:09] <%Ranryu692> that retroactively justified the curse
[1:39:11] <@SoFarFetched> you told Pat you would come to him at night and shit in his mouth
[1:39:27] <akarchives> if you're selling the anarchists cookbook for profit isn't that kind of against the point
[1:39:29] <%CommanderSqueaks> @SoFarFetched HOLY FUCK
[1:39:40] <@SoFarFetched> Mario Kart 8 VOD for reference geefSmugAF
[1:39:54] <BurningLlama777> @akarchives Or is it even *more* anarchist. :O
[1:40:00] <%CommanderSqueaks> @akarchives The evilness of consumerism is that even if you revolt, you'll just be subsumed into the consumerism.
[1:40:00] <%ospreyworks> ospreyworks subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 7 months! Another month of Peach and still not a single regret! I actually was listening to the highlights from your Baba LP to get a genuine smile for a professional photo today!
[1:40:05] <Valdorick> No reference. Only memes.
[1:40:15] <TonberryLives> Yeah Eli MAKES you say these things
[1:40:16] <@SoFarFetched> he gets a small notification when someone steps into his lasagna that goes away after awhile
[1:40:16] <%CommanderSqueaks> @akarchives Slogans become t-shirts.
[1:40:25] <@SoFarFetched> its like a heartbeat thing
[1:40:26] <+KevinsLunchbox> why not use the toolbox
[1:40:36] <+Nymphonomicon> I want to know how all these survivors are so good at fixing these generators. I'm pretty sure most of them don't have engineering degrees.
[1:40:39] <fairore> @sofarfetched she also got mad when pat called her white trash and then spit on him
[1:40:39] <Zeif00> Gens>Heals
[1:40:45] <%CommanderSqueaks> Plague.
[1:40:47] <%CommanderSqueaks> Plague stop
[1:40:49] <BoxNavy> plague :)
[1:40:55] <Valdorick> "Why are you winning the game instead of farming points for the killer!?"
[1:40:56] <@SoFarFetched> she's also thrown her meat at Pat
[1:40:57] <nivlac_555> lmao
[1:41:00] <%CommanderSqueaks> Also I'm shocked Peach doesn't know about snowballing.
[1:41:00] <BrachyZoid> The most important thing is to get points
[1:41:02] <Dunmarkh> the cum thing
[1:41:03] <akarchives> @Nymphonomicon I'd honestly believe it if the excuse is "The Entity makes it easier for them to give them hope"
[1:41:10] <+Gorshum> LUL
[1:41:11] <%DooWopShaBop> snowballing like from Clerks?
[1:41:28] <@SoFarFetched> Jesus in a Jesus? geefThink
[1:41:29] <Valdorick> Balls
[1:41:30] <%zamatermort> "God Jesus in a Jesus"
[1:41:43] <TonberryLives> LUL
[1:41:44] <@Jekado> Jesus SQUARED
[1:41:50] <%CommanderSqueaks> @Nymphonomicon If you watch the animation, they're pretty much just trying to connect things and pull levers at random. I imagine if they actually knew what they were doing, fixing the generator would take seconds.
[1:41:56] <Valdorick> "Later breeders"
[1:42:00] <+Nymphonomicon> I know Ash is at least college-educated in engineering to a point, but that's one out of like 15 people.
[1:42:18] <GrizzMango> Who's our special guest tonight?
[1:42:32] <@SoFarFetched> its Plague
[1:42:43] <BoxNavy> so cool
[1:42:44] <akarchives> damn never noticed this but Kate has a nice ass
[1:42:46] <Valdorick> He wants the McNuggets
[1:42:52] <BoxNavy> shes so cool
[1:42:52] <%CommanderSqueaks> RIP Pyramid head's ass.
[1:42:55] <+necrocannibal2> is there an Evil Dead killer?
[1:42:59] <Laecerelius> Amazing
[1:43:01] <+necrocannibal2> or is it just Ash
[1:43:05] <akarchives> Just Ash
[1:43:06] <@SoFarFetched> no Evil dead Killer,just Ash
[1:43:07] <TonberryLives> They are but the cobblestones to the castle
[1:43:13] <Valdorick> Oh wait is that just GG?
[1:43:13] <$AzureGale> T H I C C
[1:43:13] <+necrocannibal2> aw
[1:43:21] <%CommanderSqueaks> What would even BE the Evil Dead Killer?
[1:43:23] <+necrocannibal2> there should be a walking tree trying to rape people
[1:43:31] <@SoFarFetched> geefAwk I dunno about that
[1:43:35] <%CommanderSqueaks> I don't want the Tree from Evil Dead to be in this game, that' be all kinds of unfortunate.
[1:43:38] <PartyFavors> You basically soloed two gens
[1:43:40] <Laecerelius> Evil Ash?
[1:43:45] <@SoFarFetched> that sounds like that would make DbD unstreamable on twitch
[1:43:52] <+necrocannibal2> Evil Ash would be awesome actually
[1:44:00] <+Nymphonomicon> @necrocannibal2 What would an Evil Dead killer be? Evil Ash from AoD? Lucy Lawless' character from the show? A deadite-possessed survivor?
[1:44:09] <Dunmarkh> put the iconic evil dead tree in as a killer cowards
[1:44:11] <BoxNavy> gigi
