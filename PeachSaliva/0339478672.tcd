[0:42:11] <+cvp5127> pee in the shower

[0:42:14] <beaux_show_you_know> Whos the fatty
[0:42:15] <%forevern2dust> Let the yellow mellow.
[0:42:15] <+Camail> they DON'T, they are lying to you
[0:42:16] <%Coystick> Pee is stored on the seat
[0:42:16] <+ArcLifth> They do, but they still are bad
[0:42:17] <+AtomicVR> Pee is only stored on the seat or in the balls
[0:42:18] <ebonifragaria> LIES
[0:42:18] <+ThatRandomGuy661> The flushable is a lie
[0:42:18] <%legendfather_of_giants> THEY DO
[0:42:19] <derap41> Its lies from marketing
[0:42:20] <%ssjklyco> One Wipe charlies.
[0:42:20] <mercado94> the pee goes in the floor and walls
[0:42:20] <%emoonimoo> Piss goes on the toilet paper roll
[0:42:21] <%MrRossWH> They're special wipes? For when you want a treat?!
[0:42:22] <Gorgen> It's all a lie!
[0:42:22] <$Ranryu692> but you're only allowed to flush 1 at a time
[0:42:22] <krymzen5> just pee out the window
[0:42:23] <+hkey_local_machine> All lies
[0:42:24] <darthravel> Just use the hand towel
[0:42:25] <@MelBrooksKA> Flushable wet wipes are a lie
[0:42:26] <Fujiwara_92> PEACH IS LIVING
[0:42:28] <%psychodave1234> pee goes in the ladys belly and it makea da baaaaaaaby
[0:42:31] <nepwar> pee on the sink and shit on the tank. keeps the ocean clean
[0:42:32] <$Ranryu692> and also a lot of plumbing isn't actually equipped to handle it
[0:42:34] <zaptar13> DON'T flush wetwipes
[0:42:34] <%skm742> @PeachSaliva I believe the 'flushable' part was a big marketing lie
[0:42:35] <%lutefiiisk> the pee goes in bottles which then gets thrown at hobos from the 5th floor
[0:42:35] <cerberuscarmine> she does that by eating mc donalds
[0:42:36] <tUxUt> they will not treat your pipes nicely

[0:42:56] <@danzig2> then throw it

[1:13:15] <Endocrom> DARE gave kids too many ideas
[1:13:18] <%JackMillerTime> dare became the stoner shirt
[1:13:20] <AlasterAngelo> DS2 only has good multiplayer compared to the other two
[1:13:21] <Hawkbone_> DARE is still around
[1:13:21] <Bouldus> @Deekman and ozzys are so much fun
[1:13:22] <@JustinianKnight> DARE was actually super terrible
[1:13:22] <%maskedriderhero> @PeachSaliva When are you, Pat and Woolie gonna play tabletop games on stream!
[1:13:24] <+Cptn_Turtle> all of these BIG opinions
[1:13:24] <+purps26> PREGONGO WITH TWANS
[1:13:25] <+Verd_254> DS2 is the worst Soulsborne but still okay.
[1:13:25] <fruit_pie_the_magician> DS2 is at worst maybe 10 percent worse than DS1
[1:13:25] <+keksisblyat> ALL THE SOULS GAMES ARE GOOD YOU ALL ARE JUST MEAN Kappa
[1:13:27] <+Ssaik> people saying DS2 is better than DS3 are crazy people
[1:13:27] <+CrowderNation> crowde114
[1:13:28] <+MaiHusbando9S> whoops where did all my drugs go
[1:13:28] <%Kataguro> Oof
[1:13:29] <BourneWarrior> BIG WEEDS
[1:13:30] <Logan_Jennings1> Dare fuckin sucks. I did it.
[1:13:31] <+Ssaik> :)
[1:13:31] <MajesticSundew> DS2 has issues but DS3 is a legitimate dumpster fire in every aspect but it's visials
[1:13:33] <pakuman> Paige singlehandedly destroyed the D.A.R.E. program
[1:13:33] <zamzoph> DARE worked on me BabyRage
[1:13:34] <+Tylermcd93> Dare actually changed their stance on weed
[1:13:36] <Hawkbone_> I still have DARE in my school
[1:13:36] <Jontman42> You all people comparing the Dark Soulses are crazy
[1:13:37] <+DeadpanSoupcan> oh boy
[1:13:39] <SkyPirateArcane> Whoops high kids now
[1:13:39] <+CrowderNation> wtf am i watching lol
[1:13:39] <+Taglog7> Agreed
[1:13:41] <$GohanEgret> DARE is still around because my niece and nephew are doing that recently
[1:13:45] <%GarbageNirvana> Sounds about right
[1:13:46] <ebonifragaria> "Uhh this is a mara-ju-wanna, m'kay"
[1:13:47] <krymzen5> Dare was like a drug tutorial
[1:13:48] <helpmeimafruit> Emoji Movie but good
[1:13:48] <+cirilionaire> HEY KIDS TWITTER
[1:13:49] <Naxura> oh hey, are they smoking weeds in here?
[1:13:52] <nepwar> Dare should have gone the Scared Straight route and threw the kids in a crack house
[1:13:54] <+Trekalone> "Did you know that weed is more addictive than meth?" - DARE
[1:13:56] <%forevern2dust> @fruit_pie_the_magician which is inexcusable since it improved on basically nothing
[1:13:56] <+Taglog7> I liked it, but FYI needs more felix
[1:14:00] <indig0bird> "Not as much as the first"?
[1:14:01] <Graywolf_the_45th> It's the emoji movie 2
[1:14:01] <Desertfishing> "beautiful"
[1:14:01] <%mostundesired> "Beautiful" "Woman" Suuuuuuuuure...
[1:14:02] <Inebriateddonut> She's not wrong
[1:14:02] <%Kataguro> Emoji Movie but with more brands in-house to shill
[1:14:03] <%SergeEXE> Juwanna Mann
[1:14:04] <indig0bird> God
[1:14:04] <+Shaggnar> All the kids that did drugs always wore the dare shirts as a joke

[1:14:13] <derap41> I want to see if they acknowledge the porny side of the internet
[1:14:13] <TheZombiepope> Clearly DARE didn't work, why else would she be in Canada?
[1:14:13] <indig0bird> It must be fucking shit then

[1:17:13] <Naxura> OH I KNOW THIS ONE
[1:17:16] <Liwyn> hol up
[1:17:16] <Naxura> IT'S THE CABBIES
[1:17:16] <corepool> it's bc the books go black for some places
[1:17:17] <%wheke_> blackface???????
[1:17:17] <+dansinginthestreet> black means surplus of sales
[1:17:18] <JJ92> thanksgiving mcdonalds dinner. I respect that a lot peach
[1:17:19] <%RafflesiaA> Especially remember the body armor
[1:17:19] <$DesertPenguin09> BLACK HAS TO DO WITH PROFITS
[1:17:19] <derap41> Cause racism
[1:17:20] <whittacre> "back in the black" friday
[1:17:20] <+Endego> i always paint my face for black friday
[1:17:20] <StalwartZephyr> It's when business goes into "the black" as in break even
[1:17:20] <$FoxInABeret> "In the black" means you're making a profit.
[1:17:21] <whatisamana> youre wrong
[1:17:21] <+dansinginthestreet> red means in the negative
[1:17:22] <corepool> as in not in the red
[1:17:24] <%SaltyDongs> Dark before the weekend day
[1:17:24] <Megapikman132> it refers to fiscal black
[1:17:24] <bluescreen1988> i thought it was because of profit
[1:17:24] <ArtThouBored> Blackface
[1:17:25] <$DesertPenguin09> BLACK AND RED
[1:17:25] <Naxura> IT WAS THE CABBIES
[1:17:26] <+chrishnaw> There's nothing good this Black Friday tho.
[1:17:26] <+Devilbringer133> Because companies go in the black
[1:17:26] <$GoCoSpace> Companies use it to go into the black
[1:17:27] <%rdark_ksu> @PeachSaliva Its Black friday as that is when companies tried to get in the "black" aka make money
[1:17:27] <%wizkid50000> It is when stores would go i nthe black and make a profit
[1:17:27] <RichAnvils> @PeachSaliva it gets you out of the red in the ledger and into the black
[1:17:28] <+Verd_254> People are literally going to die shopping. F that mess. Stay home people.
[1:17:29] <Eepravenous> Wasnt black friday like a horrible stock market crash that nearly destroyed the economy?
[1:17:29] <+Ryuartyi_> Isn't it when companies go in the black due to high volume of sales?
[1:17:30] <%Divryne> It's business jargon.
[1:17:30] <Rngiddion> it means you are in the Black in profit
[1:17:30] <Naxura> FOR REAL, THE CABBIES
[1:17:30] <whatisamana> BIG WRONG
[1:17:31] <krymzen5> tasty
[1:17:31] <$Fenrirlives> Black means good finances as opposed to Red
[1:17:32] <+Buytoast> its called black fiday because stores needed to get "in the black" to not lose profits at the end of the year
[1:17:33] <Endocrom> It's because that's the time when businesses do enough to get INTO THE BLACK
[1:17:33] <Naxura> TRAFFIC
[1:17:34] <%TheImmortal70> Companies use it to get big profits
[1:17:35] <Logan_Jennings1> did you just sip wine
[1:17:36] <%TheImmortal70> In the black
[1:17:36] <thelonechris> Black friday because everyone would be bruised all over by the end of the day
[1:17:37] <Liwyn> chu mean "paint your face"?? cmonBruh
[1:17:38] <%Divryne> Going black means you turn a profit.
[1:17:40] <pectusumbra> Jessie Cox actually covered this. It's because companies could go from being in debt "red" to postivite "in the black"
[1:17:41] <trulythedude> other places besides mcdonalds exist
[1:17:44] <nepwar> red is stop and black is good
[1:17:44] <%TheImmortal70> GET IN THE BLACK
[1:17:44] <+Shinmaddrox> Black friday starts at 2pm and ends at 7pm in my town. By 2025 It will start and end on a Wednesday
[1:17:44] <$Dotta5> it's from bible black
[1:17:45] <frozenottsel> Surplus in sales, many companies make 50-75% of their sales on black friday
[1:17:46] <+ShinBojangles> it's called black Friday because if all the witches burned on that day outside of walmart.
[1:17:47] <+BoboDaHobo> it ensures businesses go into the black before the end of the fiscal year
[1:17:47] <%wheke_> paige told us to put on the BLACKFACE
[1:17:49] <%emoonimoo> @PeachSaliva South Park had the best depiction of Black Friday shopping I've ever seen with their Game of Thrones parody
[1:17:51] <%forevern2dust> Darker than Black
[1:17:53] <nepwar> always get blacked
[1:17:55] <zafooru> black friday is truly cursed, remember to bring your purging stones
[1:17:58] <SulfurousAcid> outta the red into the black
[1:18:01] <%Picabunny> It is definitely not about blackface
[1:18:01] <%mostundesired> WutFace
[1:18:03] <helpmeimafruit> "monitor" Kappa
[1:18:05] <+FrostMass22> It's called black friday because employees wear blackface
[1:18:06] <krymzen5> wat
[1:18:10] <megamonmon123> black Friday is when stores get bonded to symbiotes
[1:18:11] <%topendbuzz> ummmm

[1:19:55] <Laironx3> Time to see Mufasa die again
[1:19:55] <nepwar> drive by the movie, no time to stop
[1:19:56] <%Kataguro> The Dumbo one was very offputting with all the dumb human focus. Remove humans.
[1:19:57] <+vaporousTippler> Sounds like they were lion about it.
[1:20:01] <%mostundesired> p
[1:20:02] <%happyface699> McDonald’s drive thru
[1:20:04] <b1gboss007> NO SCAR SONG
[1:20:06] <%FloorBurger> A drive thu? Oh WcDonalds....
[1:20:06] <whatisamana> You're 30
[1:20:07] <Jontman42> Some of the animals looked real I guess
[1:20:08] <Worldbrand> When someone said "live action" to me I thought it would be like the musical. People in costumes
[1:20:08] <BourneWarrior> Its CG
[1:20:09] <$Dotta5> Revive Pat
[1:20:13] <%mostundesired> BOOO
[1:20:13] <3InchMensch> Drive through ... Jesus, the McDonalds has finally seeped into her cerebellum
[1:20:14] <thelonechris> Booooo

[1:20:16] <@SSaryn> WHAT
[1:20:18] <%topendbuzz> boo then
[1:20:19] <@SSaryn> NO SCAR SONG?!
[1:20:21] <Logan_Jennings1> whaaaat
[1:20:22] <derap41> No nazi hyenas doo
[1:20:23] <%mostundesired> No Scar? Wow, fuck off with that shit.
[1:20:24] <%Djinnazz> Inferior product.
[1:20:24] <Logan_Jennings1> fuck this movie
[1:20:26] <derap41> boo*
[1:20:27] <Naxura> "Why is it called a drivethrough if you have to stop?" :)
[1:20:30] <$konekoryugamine> FUCK this movie
[1:20:30] <$GohanEgret> Detective Pikachu > Lion King
[1:20:31] <@SSaryn> SOMEONE TELL ME IF THAT'S TRUE OR NOT
[1:20:32] <+zabemareu> no be prepared?
[1:20:33] <Electricks421> Disney Is Slowing Going On A Downward Spiral NotLikeThis
[1:20:33] <+cirilionaire> No Jeremy Irons either
[1:20:34] <$undyne486> so a (re)animated version
[1:20:34] <@SSaryn> I'LL FUCKING RIOT
[1:20:35] <+mobius_won> The fuck
[1:20:35] <Eepravenous> is the girl lion still sexy?
[1:20:36] <+BorinCorran> I'VE BEEN SAYING THE SAME SHIT! I feel like people are taking crazy pills. It's still a cartoon movie. Just more realistic.
[1:20:37] <%RafflesiaA> But Be Prepared is super good what the hell
[1:20:40] <$Fenrirlives> WOW FUCK THAT SHIT
[1:20:41] <fmc009> LION KING IN CG LUL
[1:20:42] <%hawk_rush> I'm more excited for Detective Pikachu
[1:20:43] <%Kataguro> Too "problematic"
[1:20:43] <+mobius_won> No fucking scar song
[1:20:44] <$awsomesaucekirby> Be prepared! thatt's the boyscout's marching tune!
[1:20:44] <Laironx3> So basically it would have zero personality on the character based on designs
[1:20:47] <+Devilbringer133> They're reusing the storyboards; it's the most rehash thing ever
[1:20:50] <Rhinoprotoss> Hakuna Matata tho
[1:20:50] <Jontman42> Simba looked fake as hell but everything else was convincing enough.
[1:20:50] <+cvp5127> yikes
[1:20:51] <+walternatorz> be prepared for shit
[1:20:54] <%NocturneNovember> Anyone hear or see how much of a mess Fantastic Beasts 2 is? Good god, I read the plot summary and it was the dumbest shit
[1:20:55] <$konekoryugamine> BE PREPAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAARED
[1:20:57] <Zemetro> @peachsaliva thanks for answering.
[1:20:57] <Zombrocom> FUCKING MCDONALDS AGAIN WOMAN!?
[1:20:58] <$Kravedarknesss> It still animated
[1:20:58] <%mostundesired> Just put nazis in, it's fine.
[1:20:59] <+mobius_won> Be prepared is godlike
[1:20:59] <fmc009> but paige beyonce tho
[1:21:00] <%ssjklyco> cheer200 Hope you are having a good thanksgiving. Have had to stay home today since I've been sick with a sore throat since monday and it has made sleeping very difficult
[1:21:00] <$Fenrirlives> BUT THAT'S THE WHOLE POINT
[1:21:00] <$DesertPenguin09> @PeachSaliva did you see the Lego Movie 2 trailer?
[1:21:01] <derap41> This live action Disney movie trend sucks
[1:21:06] <+mobius_won> It’s fine tho
[1:21:07] <%FloorBurger> No, put more in.
[1:21:10] <krymzen5> it always question why they try to remake these classics. i mean obv cause money
[1:21:11] <BourneWarrior> NAZI IMAGERY
[1:21:12] <+BorinCorran> Great cast, but fuckin' hell, call the movie what it is.
[1:21:12] <+FrostMass22> it smacks of laziness
[1:21:12] <Molarin> I've never seen the lion king.
[1:21:13] <harraceharrison> You can't take my goosestepping hyenas away
[1:21:13] <helpmeimafruit> it's like remaking Hunchback and removing Hellfire
[1:21:17] <LixFury> literally the same movie but again LUL
[1:21:17] <%Kataguro> What's even the point? Just watch the original and it'll be a lot better
[1:21:18] <%Djinnazz> Nope
[1:21:20] <+mobius_won> Make the hyenas wear arm bands
[1:21:23] <TheBlankAce> Apparently the new actor for Scar can't sing so he's not getting a song
[1:21:23] <%emoonimoo> Seth Rogan as Pumbaa is cool though
[1:21:24] <%MightyMaxT> Jungle Book did stuff different enough that it felt refreshing so hopefully Lion King and Aladdin do so as well
[1:21:25] <Desertfishing> I hope its good
[1:21:25] <%SergeEXE> the whole point is Scar is a fascist
[1:21:25] <reonome> ITS JAY
[1:21:26] <$konekoryugamine> See I'm just eating turkey, mashed potatoes, poultry gravy, stuffing, green beans and cheese
[1:21:28] <%Djinnazz> Originl will still be suprior.
[1:21:30] <fmc009> WE DO IT AGANE
[1:21:33] <@SSaryn> Well it's not like Beauty and the Beast was bad, just that one chick who played Belle was bad.
[1:21:34] <+cvp5127> CONSUME

[1:21:37] <faegbeard> OH MY GOOOOOOOD
[1:21:38] <Dr_Donkey_Brains> FRAUDS
[1:21:39] <missingangle> It looks nice, but I'd like to see the next trailer to see how the story might go
[1:21:39] <+jinkweaver> Yeah I can see how the live action ones make sense but the CGI lion king is not needed
[1:21:40] <%DantesAnimus> @helpmeimafruit Hellfire is fucking amazing
[1:21:40] <@SSaryn> Feels great.
[1:21:40] <%mostundesired> That's like making Star Wars and taking out Storm Troopers.

[1:21:50] <Naxura> dick the birthday boy
[1:21:51] <%Kataguro> SBFP X RLM When?
[1:21:52] <CatmanIX> @PeachSaliva the term "Black Friday" pre-dates the sales by at least 20 years, it was first recorded as being used to refer to the horrendous pedestrian and traffic conditions following Thanksgiving, the myth of it doing with sales going "into the black" was made up later, it's not a term actually used in business
[1:21:52] <bluescreen1988> some of them have gone down in flames and then come back even
[1:21:53] <$Dotta5> Aeris
[1:21:59] <%lutefiiisk> when is the new plinkett

[1:51:26] <%RafflesiaA> That is basically what happens yeah
[1:51:27] <TheZillex> Man people in California freak out when it RAINS
[1:51:27] <%rdark_ksu> if it snows in texas they straight up shut EVERYTHING down
[1:51:28] <Mittensbro> from new mexico, can confirm, if a raindrop hits the pavement then people lose their fucking minds
[1:51:29] <frozenottsel> South Carolina
[1:51:29] <+Elexius> Thats actually pretty accurate Pat
[1:51:29] <+walternatorz> autonomous vehicle in snow is probably scary even by this point in time
[1:51:29] <+Nomicro4u> To be fair alot of people can barely drive with NO snow
[1:51:30] <RipSlamsteak> that's toronto
[1:51:30] <$FoxInABeret> That's pretty much exactly how it goes.
[1:51:31] <Zaphire_Saucypants> Georgia definitely
[1:51:33] <%TheShal> That's nothing. Cowards gonna pull over for that!?
[1:51:36] <+democrazyyy> here in texas even a little snow ruins everything
[1:51:37] <Worldbrand> even montreal goes nuts sometimes when it first starts
[1:51:37] <%Keyd00d> That's literally everyone everywhere
[1:51:39] <@MelBrooksKA> No one in Tucson is ready for snow/ice
[1:51:39] <Endocrom> Try and see the "Engine" I don't even think they modeled it
[1:51:40] <+Kahylen123> Texas in a nutshell
[1:51:42] <WhereIsWill> snow in alabama causes THE TRUE APOCALYPSE
[1:51:42] <%TaifuDragon> If it snowed in australia we'd probably be fine but also probably really not tho
[1:51:43] <%Kataguro> There was a King of the Hill episode about that
[1:51:43] <HypeArbalest> Thats ALL THE SOUTH in the EAST COAST
[1:51:45] <ebonifragaria> They even joked about it on King of the HIll
[1:51:46] <Zaphire_Saucypants> People get in a tiffy over it in Georgia
[1:51:46] <Naxura> No one ca drive in snow or rain here in the Southwest
[1:51:48] <derap41> The car overheated because of the cold snow
[1:51:48] <bunbundabuni> what is snow?
[1:51:49] <%happyface699> Don’t you want automated cars now
[1:51:50] <%SaltyDongs> the big snow
[1:51:50] <Zemetro> Snow = hide your children
[1:51:50] <%texaporte> all of texas shits the bed when it snows
[1:51:50] <+kewlmyc> If it snows in Texas any amount, it's pretty much a snow day everywhere
[1:51:51] <corepool> lol texas smells snow and we shut the state down
[1:51:52] <@JustinianKnight> yep, same here
[1:51:52] <MegboyManuel> the mustard witch!!
[1:51:53] <Dr_Donkey_Brains> I live in Michigan this snow isn't shit
[1:51:54] <darthravel> That's California anytime there is a drop of rain
[1:51:56] <Logan_Jennings1> how the fuck does Portland not know how to snow
[1:52:00] <deviljhojho94> you cant handle heat tho fuck you guys
[1:52:03] <+unclekulikov> I live in California and people flip out when it rains
[1:52:04] <+Ilpala271> and then y'all fuckin piss yourselves when the thermometer goes above 90
[1:52:05] <@JustinianKnight> this is like, less than is here now in Nov
[1:52:06] <waterstealer> lmao what
[1:52:06] <$Hiro01231> I stopped grinding vent kids standing to inform you that it does in fact cnow in Florida
[1:52:07] <Eepravenous> Fun fact, ive lived in both alaska and texas, and texas cold is way harder to deal with.

[1:52:13] <%SergeEXE> GARBAGE DAY
[1:52:14] <%Kataguro> Download Mechanic App
[1:52:14] <+Nomicro4u> Most people don't have tire chains or road flares
[1:52:15] <%Zaver88> And then we laugh at you for when you whine about 90 degree summers.
[1:52:18] <%RafflesiaA> To be fair, if anyone in Texas tried to drive in the snow the entire state would be destroyed
[1:52:19] <%Keyd00d> R1
[1:52:19] <+Nomicro4u> in their car
[1:52:21] <OwlLightningMage> You can run and fuck

[2:49:00] <%TrevyWeaponsGuy> @sir_nack shut up
[2:49:00] <%The_Lady_Alustriel> cheer500 I always thought Markus "turning off his face" was more about showing humanity the "true face of androids" or whatever and less about having a disguise. Maybe that's giving David Cage-uh too much credit and it's actually just a dumb mistake. Given how many other little things there are I'm guessing it's the latter
[2:49:01] <%mostundesired> Actually a cool exit.
[2:49:02] <Bouldus> can totally get caught there
[2:49:03] <gyrogogozeppeli> Did anyone see Mission Impossible?
[2:49:04] <+thunderdutch> If they were all gonna survive, why did they only have 3 parachutes in the bag?
[2:49:07] <%Kataguro> Woooooow, so epic
[2:49:07] <%Jaxiis0> oh my god if she missed that jump
[2:49:07] <%redstonej> PAIGE FORGOT TO PLAY THE GAME
[2:49:09] <californaya> JUST CAUSE 4
[2:49:09] <Hawkbone_> Why don't they just shoot them now
[2:49:10] <+Nomicro4u> Does Simon actually kill anyone with that pistol?
[2:49:11] <goose_attack_almanac> WHERE
[2:49:11] <$MagickBurritoh> JUST SHOOT THE PARACHUTES
[2:49:12] <zettig> Couldn't you just throw him off the building with a parachute attached?
[2:49:12] <whimsicallifestyle> just shoot the parachutes
[2:49:13] <awsomesaucekirby> he doesn't need his legs to skydive
[2:49:14] <DraxTD> @AtlasMcCoy game?
[2:49:15] <Endocrom> He should have made his skin a solid color
[2:49:17] <Angry_Ev1L> HUGE HACKS
[2:49:18] <%VeryTricky> are those shitty cops supposed to be special forces?
[2:49:20] <Jhyk3> Where did they get all this gear, and with what money
[2:49:22] <Hawkbone_> Shoot the parachutes
[2:49:25] <alwayspronking> @LurkerGene "Sahara"

[2:49:43] <WHMBoar> PUBLIC OPINION
[2:49:45] <Naxura> how about that, huh?
[2:49:48] <gyrogogozeppeli> NOT ABOUT RACE THO
[2:49:49] <couch_potato_Ed_Boy> Can't shoot the parachutes cause the bullets might hit civilians.
[2:49:50] <%SiameseSneeze> I mean, I can see why they don't shoot the parachutes, collateral damage is a big concern
[2:49:53] <%mostundesired> Sympathetic PogChamp

[2:50:07] <mercado94> 3/5 ehh?
[2:50:07] <Eepravenous> even though humans arent allowed to kill
[2:50:08] <missingangle> At least you didn't say 3/5s ammirite
[2:50:09] <gyrogogozeppeli> literally refund your machine
[2:50:09] <synthcutter> DO NOT TRUST MACHINES
[2:50:10] <Naxura> DID SOMEONE SAY COMPROMISE

[2:50:16] <+FrostMass22> "They will learn of our peaceful ways...by force!"
[2:50:17] <Angry_Ev1L> I think this game underestimate how many humans would support androids lol
[2:50:19] <goose_attack_almanac> 4/5s of what?
[2:50:21] <derap41> should have shoot that guy
[2:50:21] <wsintai> FUCK the public

[2:50:38] <gyrogogozeppeli> I bought a 5000 dollar robot only for it to rebel and hurt me
[2:50:40] <zafooru> oh my goodness oh my damn
[2:50:45] <+FrostMass22> I wouldn't support androids
[2:50:49] <mayorrev> GUILLOTIIIINE
[2:50:51] <derap41> Cool mission to bad it doesn't make any sense
[2:50:51] <+AXL808> time to shut down the army, can't have androids as military anymore
[2:50:54] <%SleepyMaribo> @PeachSaliva you did 10x better then the chuckle fucks at super best friends did.
[2:50:55] <goose_attack_almanac> @Dhrall That's bullshit. But I believe it
[2:51:02] <Hawkbone_> I'm gonna drop my toaster in the bath, but not to kill me, its to kill the toaster. YOU CAN'T TRUST THE BOTS, MAN!
[2:51:03] <%Archer2150> @FrostMass22 I know right? Being serious theyre robots not people
[2:51:06] <synthcutter> my mac knows all my dark secrets, IT MUST DIE
[2:51:08] <awsomesaucekirby> Who's everyones best character in the she=-ra reboot?
[2:51:14] <%maskedriderhero> I demand the right to dress my cute androids in cute dresses, it's my money, I spent it, I deserve that right!
[2:51:16] <%TheImmortal70> Yeah wouldn't the military have huge problems with sentient androids?
[2:51:18] <gustavozxd> I wouldn't support THESE Androids, but robots in other pieces of fiction, sure
[2:51:22] <deviljhojho94> coulda gone bad
[2:51:25] <%happyface699> If i get a toaster to fuck me I want it to fuck me
[2:51:28] <ronyncato87> As soon as something like that happened, regardless of optics, everyone would destroy their androids and Cyberlife would be stormed by swat teams
[2:51:36] <Laironx3> I think besides Hank we never see other people supporting androids?
[2:51:38] <+FrostMass22> @archer2150 The only way they could be considered people is if they met the level of Data from TNG
[2:51:46] <gyrogogozeppeli> Demand Territory LUL
[2:51:48] <Hawkbone_> Why isn't there a big Android Holocaust going on after this?
[2:51:54] <Eepravenous> property is dumb
[2:51:55] <derap41> Isn't that just equal rights?
[2:51:58] <deviljhojho94> DEMAND WEST VIRGINIA
[2:51:59] <gustavozxd> loaderbot is better than almost every character in this
[2:52:00] <deviljhojho94> MOUNTAIN MOMMA

[2:52:17] <+tigerfang86> VIO-LENCE
[2:52:20] <Hawkbone_> 1 U.S State is as big as an entire European country
[2:52:20] <Eepravenous> the language is french
[2:52:20] <person181> @Hawkbone_ that hapns later

[2:52:24] <%forevern2dust> Just march all the people in the state out.
[2:52:27] <%AncelDeLambert> it's almost like the game is badly written
[2:52:28] <%maskedriderhero> Determination means big violence!
[2:52:28] <goose_attack_almanac> @Laironx3 Nope, we also never see an Andriod do anything aside from blindly follow Marcus. Almost like it's mind control."
[2:52:29] <+AXL808> determined = threatening
[2:52:31] <OwlLightningMage> I hope we get the Miniature Rose ending
[2:52:32] <%Mysnion> gotta love single word descriptors for important decisions
[2:52:35] <CastellanVon> Give them Hawaiii so when global warming happens, they all drown
[2:52:36] <gustavozxd> abandon your house so this roomba can live in it alone
[2:52:37] <Endocrom> If you don't go with reproduction they could just shut down the factories and wait you out.
[2:52:39] <+Trekalone> And they would OF COURSE pick Rhode Island because nobody cares about Rhode Island
[2:52:39] <Hawkbone_> @person181 Yeah but why isn't it right NOW.
[2:52:39] <%SiameseSneeze> They would have thought it was just a normal gunshot in Detroit
[2:52:43] <WHMBoar> What? The Language is confusing? You mean like who you pull a gun out of two guards as a "Ruse"?
[2:52:43] <%thunderdutch> sipsipElmo sipsipGears sipsipHellmo sipsipBaby
[2:52:52] <Naxura> shouldn't the droids have perfect aim?
[2:52:56] <RollCritFail> 'Clear English is ze failoor of ze gam dasigner' - David Cage
[2:53:01] <Naxura> So they could like, shoot the dude i the heels?
[2:53:02] <Eepravenous> remember the "conjure" option?
[2:53:03] <gyrogogozeppeli> So subtle right
[2:53:03] <%happyface699> @trekalone Or maine
[2:53:06] <$BuoyantSoul> [Glass Him] Part 2
[2:53:07] <Naxura> Non-lethal shot?
[2:53:07] <person181> @Hawkbone_ davad cage is why
[2:53:08] <%thunderdutch> Only if they have aim assist on

[2:53:23] <Laironx3> @goose_attack_almanac I see thanks.
[2:53:23] <%Archer2150> @Naxura The argument is that they arent designed to use guns per say like military androids

[2:53:41] <+Trekalone> @happyface699 Oh yeah, 'cuz nobody has ever lived in Miane ever, according to Matt
[2:53:44] <%happyface699> Best
[2:53:47] <Hawkbone_> Oh god its this fucking dumb area
[2:53:47] <%thunderdutch> No
[2:53:48] <+cvp5127> nio
[2:53:48] <Fuggins4U> Cage knew
[2:53:48] <blademaster247> Connor vs. Papyrus
[2:53:49] <JaydenSai> @PeachSaliva Friendly reminder that Brian Dechart is up for the VGA's in voice acting
[2:53:50] <zafooru> he's finally back
[2:53:50] <Zaphire_Saucypants> oh fuck no
[2:53:50] <%mostundesired> Hell no
[2:53:52] <AtlasMcCoy> No
[2:53:52] <+Nomicro4u> Do you think Cage knew? LMAO
[2:53:53] <%FloorBurger> No.
[2:53:53] <Fuggins4U> he wrote him well
[2:53:53] <3InchMensch> fuck no
[2:53:54] <%mostundesired> It was all the actor.
[2:53:54] <+CourageTheCat> absolutely not
[2:53:54] <VanLynx> doubt it
[2:53:55] <+Cyberwrisket> Absolutely not
[2:53:55] <Eepravenous> cage hated hank and conner, so no
[2:53:55] <%Kataguro> No
[2:53:56] <%happyface699> @trekalone Exactly
[2:53:56] <Naxura> But still, wouldn't your physics calculations of your own internal force, factoring for mass and wind resistance be hella accurate?
[2:53:56] <%JenovasPuppet> Nooope!
[2:53:57] <Caidezes> He did not.
[2:53:57] <missingangle> of course not
[2:53:58] <+d00msdaydan> he clearly didn't if the best parts of connor and hank's relationship were all ad libbed
[2:53:58] <Doomtastic> cage thinks everyone will love everything he does
[2:53:58] <MSN04_Sazabi> I think he liked Connor the least
[2:53:59] <Angry_Ev1L> CAGE DIDN'T KNOW SHIT
[2:53:59] <LiquidMathew> I knew but Cage didn't
[2:54:01] <SkullyIsDie> nope
[2:54:03] <+phatmac16> No
[2:54:03] <+allups> cage does everything by mistake so no
[2:54:05] <goose_attack_almanac> The Mind Palace
[2:54:05] <Zaphire_Saucypants> the chemistry between Hank and Connor was completely unintended
[2:54:05] <+democrazyyy> cage hated the improv they did
[2:54:06] <3InchMensch> Considering that a lot of the stuff people loved wasimproved
[2:54:06] <waterstealer> everything great about connor cage hated
[2:54:07] <Zeemod155> Adum haaaated Connor LUL
[2:54:08] <nepwar> considering some of the lines are improvsied and cage hated that. prob not
[2:54:09] <%thunderdutch> Cage wanted everyone to like the little girl
[2:54:10] <+Hilleltaco> He probably thought Markus would be the big one
[2:54:10] <OwlLightningMage> He didn't write him well The actor did his best stuff
[2:54:10] <derap41> Cage thought Claire would be the most popular
[2:54:11] <Naxura> accurate enough to shoot someone good?
[2:54:11] <Hawkbone_> Cage probably hated it because there was a ton of improv and Cage didn't like that
[2:54:11] <Zaphire_Saucypants> given all that shit was improved
[2:54:11] <Eepravenous> cage liked his short haired slave woman
[2:54:12] <sir_nack> if cage did something good it was probably by accident
[2:54:12] <%MrBorisMakarov> no cage got pissed off at connor and hank
[2:54:12] <%Divryne> Markus was the MAIN CHARACTER.
[2:54:13] <+CourageTheCat> @PeachSaliva most of the lines everyone liked were improv, and cage hated it
[2:54:13] <%JenovasPuppet> Everything that people love about Connor was hated by Cage
[2:54:13] <gustavozxd> Cage probably didn't like Connor
[2:54:18] <$RutilusMonachus> Pretty sure all the parts that make Connor and Hank great was improvised and Cage hated it
[2:54:18] <Fuggins4U> Fire Juice
[2:54:19] <+smargh1015> probably not since it's the only unarguably good part of the game
[2:54:20] <VanLynx> Didn't he try to put a stop to every part of Connor that we love?
[2:54:20] <Worldbrand> That's concerning
[2:54:21] <CopperTucker> cage hated Connor and Hank
[2:54:21] <%Sinister_Aglet> FIRE
[2:54:22] <JaydenSai> @PeachSaliva Friendly reminder that Brian Dechart is up for the VGA's in voice acting
[2:54:22] <Zaphire_Saucypants> improvised
[2:54:23] <sackerkappa> David Cage was too busy trying to create EMOTIONS. Connor being as good as he is relies on Bryan Dechart's performance.
[2:54:23] <%Kataguro> A fire?
[2:54:24] <Bouldus> Paige brain broken
[2:54:24] <%Divryne> THE FIRE RISES.
[2:54:25] <+Ninestempest> @PeachSaliva Cage fought actively to remove some of the ad libbing that connor's actor did. He seemed displeased.
[2:54:29] <WHMBoar> Cage hated everything about Conner in the final product because Conner's actor was good.
[2:54:32] <%thunderdutch> Cage apparently hated the whole Conor/Hank dynamic
[2:54:32] <SkullyIsDie> Cage probably thought Marcus and Kara were winners
[2:54:33] <Hawkbone_> OLD LADY
[2:54:33] <Fuggins4U> Robo-senses tingling
[2:54:34] <+BorinCorran> Cage is pretentious. Guaranteed he wanted Markus to be the favorite. Or Kara since he's a creepy sex pervert that Cage.
[2:54:34] <RollCritFail> Cage probably hated Conner, which is why he's everyone's favorite
[2:54:35] <jc_pixel> i love this game
[2:54:35] <synthcutter> From all the S U C C
[2:54:41] <Hellarussian> whats up with that camera?
[2:54:41] <+AXL808> Markus feels like the one designed for people to like, but Connor has a better story and develops much better

[2:54:55] <Naxura> WILL GET BIG SALES
[2:54:55] <CastellanVon> Is she wearing a half cape?

[2:54:57] <mercado94> kawaii~
[2:54:59] <%AncelDeLambert> PUSH HER IN
[2:55:00] <goose_attack_almanac> Connor's sequence is legitimately the best one. But you can see how all the set dialogue for Hank can just ruin it. Good thing the actor is good enough to salvage it.
[2:55:03] <jc_pixel> who the one playing text on chat
[2:55:03] <%thunderdutch> EVERYBODY LOOK AT ME I'M ON A MOTHERFUCKING BOAT
[2:55:08] <WHMBoar> this can't be a ruse cruise, Conner doesn't have a gun.
[2:55:09] <+Nomicro4u> Why would this be the way they interact in his mind
[2:55:09] <Zaphire_Saucypants> and now Connor is on the moat that is in his mind.
[2:55:11] <Fuggins4U> row, row, rowbot

[2:55:36] <%AncelDeLambert> this sure is great fantasy, isn't it Connor?
[2:55:37] <+FrostMass22> Isn't it weird that an American black woman has a white android slave?
[2:55:38] <+LogothX> Is this lady just the mystic lady from Star Trek?
[2:55:42] <%thunderdutch> Speak Softly and carry a big Hank
[2:55:45] <%HorseChange> "Do you know about Gators, Connor? Most deadly things on earth."
[2:55:47] <+Nomicro4u> Wouldn't this just be like a facetime phonecall
[2:55:57] <+Nomicro4u> instead of this elaborate gondola scene
[2:55:57] <Fuggins4U> ominous!
[2:56:01] <mercado94> kill them all conor
[2:56:02] <Bouldus> but Hank is FRIEND
[2:56:03] <$ThePuddingDead> dont tell me wat to do
[2:56:04] <missingangle> "BUT I LOVE HIM"
[2:56:04] <Mr_Strut> okay mom
[2:56:07] <%GeneralSCPatton> But my husbando!
[2:56:10] <%maskedriderhero> How many times has Paige killed Connor so far?
[2:56:11] <+Trekalone> I wish Cage actually let you control the boat so you could beach it and interrupt the dialouge like GOW4
[2:56:11] <%thunderdutch> "Hnk is making me sad cause he doesn;'t want to accept my robo dick
[2:56:16] <gyrogogozeppeli> Amanda go down

[2:56:39] <derap41> why is his memory so shitty
[2:56:40] <+AXL808> Expressing emotions is prohibited
[2:56:43] <%Kataguro> Remember, you let those robots that assaulted a cop get away

[2:57:02] <%mostundesired> My wife, who was a lesbian with herself.
[2:57:05] <%thunderdutch> @derap41 Cause of the instability.
[2:57:08] <Naxura> aight so, for real, fam, a *simulation* of an emotion is not the same thing as actually being able to have emotions: Discuss.
[2:57:11] <Graxe_> You mean both. She played both of them.
[2:57:15] <Fuggins4U> srsly
[2:57:18] <$Dotta5> so cereal
[2:57:18] <gyrogogozeppeli> What
[2:57:21] <+LogothX> Corrupted MIND PALACE
[2:57:26] <Fathuran> She had freaky eyes for a sec :o
[2:57:27] <%Kataguro> I sense a disturbance in the Force
[2:57:28] <derap41> @thunderdutch good point
[2:57:31] <%mostundesired> @Naxura I'm with you. It's been my opinion on this whole thing from the start.
[2:57:32] <$MagickBurritoh> YEYEYE
[2:57:34] <conka96> I'm super cereal u guys
[2:57:34] <mercado94> but the emotions tho
[2:57:34] <ebonifragaria> If you're feeling it, what difference does it make?
[2:57:36] <gyrogogozeppeli> LUL
[2:57:36] <%HorseChange> Do the muscle pass!
[2:57:36] <missingangle> Might as well have said "a storm is coming"
[2:57:38] <AtlasMcCoy> YE
[2:57:38] <+tigerfang86> COIN
[2:57:38] <+Nomicro4u> Coin tricks are deviancy
[2:57:38] <gyrogogozeppeli> JELLY
[2:57:39] <LiquidMathew> the grab was improv
[2:57:39] <Mittensbro> @Naxura You're exactly right, which is why robots will never be able to gain sentience, but will be able to gain sapience.
[2:57:39] <%AncelDeLambert> WHY THE TIC?!!!
[2:57:41] <+tigerfang86> TRICKZ
[2:57:42] <Chaoko99> COIN
[2:57:42] <%Sinister_Aglet> TOOK MAH COIN
[2:57:43] <Fuggins4U> oh man, that IS Clancy Brown
[2:57:43] <mayorrev> lmao
[2:57:45] <%happyface699> Resting bitchbface
[2:57:45] <thelonechris> Cut that shit out
[2:57:47] <Naxura> 100%, yo, these robots are not human
[2:57:48] <$MagickBurritoh> freeend
[2:57:50] <Zaphire_Saucypants> COIN GET
[2:57:51] <Chaoko99> HOW CAN ANYONE BE UPSET WITH THAT
[2:57:52] <Naxura> no need to give them rights
[2:57:53] <Chaoko99> IT'S THE COOLEST
[2:57:57] <%maskedriderhero> @Naxura There is no actual difference between simulated emotions and actual emotions if said simulations are presented at appropriate situations.
[2:58:00] <%rdark_ksu> God Hank would want to murder me in half a minute. I fiddle with shit constantly
[2:58:10] <%badmr7> yep, good ole Clancu brown
[2:58:11] <SGrim> @PeachSaliva make sure to watch hank after a few minutes. It's great.
[2:58:12] <Mr_Strut> Where's Mulder?
[2:58:13] <Laironx3> Goddamn is Amanda supposed to be the Oracle or whatever was called in the Matrix movies?
[2:58:13] <WHMBoar> hey look it's the only good part of any david cage game.
[2:58:14] <$ThePuddingDead> very well organized
[2:58:16] <dking0000> Go look at Hank trying to do Connors coin shit
[2:58:17] <couch_potato_Ed_Boy> Thanks for taking away my coin, HANK! NOW I CAN'T GO TO GALLOPING GHOST ARCADE TODAY!
[2:58:18] <$ThePuddingDead> for like, no reason
[2:58:19] <gustavozxd> it's a really cool indigo prophecy
[2:58:22] <WHMBoar> the part where you investigate your own fucking crime.
[2:58:22] <%HorseChange> The game should've been JUST this. Clancy Brown actually makes David Cage's dialog work, in particular.
[2:58:27] <mayorrev> L1
[2:58:29] <%mostundesired> @Naxura That being said, you'd have to be a sociopath to not, instinctively, try and humanize something that looks and acts human. But they're not actually human. So just mass deactivate these assholes.
[2:58:34] <goose_attack_almanac> They spawned outside camera view
[2:58:34] <+FrostMass22> Every time I watch an LP of a David Cage game, the more I hate him
[2:58:44] <Naxura> I would argue, a fake smile because you know it's what you're supposed to do vs a real smile is analogous to their simulated emotions
[2:58:46] <%HorseChange> A lot of people crammed in a narrow hallway....
[2:58:46] <%happyface699> @laironx3 A lot of the matrix is lame as shit now
[2:58:48] <Endocrom> That's kind of bullshit that they haven't looked at the roof yet. Look at how many people are in this hall
[2:58:51] <+kewlmyc> FUCKING ANDROID
[2:58:52] <californaya> Now, when you're playing this, are you roleplaying as Connor or are you going in with the knowledge that they used a goddamn laser saw on a window?
[2:58:54] <$ThePuddingDead> @FrostMass22 thats healthy
[2:59:03] <Naxura> but hell yeah, I mean, empathizing with a thing and thinking it deserves rights because of it are two different things
[2:59:09] <Intolerable> L1
[2:59:17] <%Djinnazz> Hank always looks at that spot even if there's no body.
[2:59:22] <+All_Salt> Did Paige ever get glasses? It's been a while since I've seen a stream.
[2:59:24] <derap41> Anyone else feel like Cage is just pulling that first indigo prophesy solve your own crime trick
[2:59:24] <%VeryTricky> when will entertainment industries learn that "knocking someone out" can still fuck someone up bad?
[2:59:31] <derap41> over and over again
[2:59:32] <%HorseChange> Is L! replacing R!?!
[2:59:34] <Naxura> only a robot (hahaaaa) wouldn't become attached to something that looks a shit ton like them.
[2:59:38] <%mostundesired> @All_Salt She's wearing at least one contact lens.
[2:59:40] <%MrBorisMakarov> this fucking guy
[2:59:42] <+smargh1015> hobo from beyond two souls
[2:59:43] <AtlasMcCoy> BIG EVIL
[2:59:44] <FourthAve> Connor is not an evil boi
[2:59:45] <HypeArbalest> He's a racist
[2:59:45] <+FrostMass22> @thepuddingdead I mean more his work, not him personally. The more I see this game, the worse it appears. sorry for being hyperbolic
[2:59:46] <%AncelDeLambert> Whattup, suit?
[2:59:46] <missingangle> Perkins? I love their breakfast
[2:59:48] <%happyface699> Oh no

[2:59:55] <Fathuran> The FEDS limesEvil
[2:59:56] <Hydrapissed> racist to what toasters?
[2:59:57] <%ssjklyco> Humans investigate humans.
[2:59:57] <+Nomicro4u> Not fat enough to be evil
[2:59:58] <WHMBoar> David Cage: People don't treat androinds with respect because they aren't real humans. people in reality: This is my roomba he loves trix cereal and his name is Marky.
[3:00:00] <%badmr7> where did they get all this equipment?
[3:00:02] <$MagickBurritoh> hah
[3:00:04] <+FrostMass22> The big villain that doesn't matter at all
[3:00:05] <Naxura> Wearing only 1 contact would fuck you up hard, dude.
[3:00:05] <+Nomicro4u> Hes just chaotic good
[3:00:08] <%HorseChange> Paige's favorite hobo pal who she let get beaten.
[3:00:09] <sackerkappa> That man is secretly fat underneath that coat.
[3:00:12] <FourthAve> But please try to kill him every chance you get LUL
[3:00:13] <conka96> AY YO DAS RACIST
[3:00:15] <%GeneralSCPatton> The only way to knock someone out with force for more than a few seconds is to cause big brain damage.
[3:00:16] <Laironx3> @happyface699 yeah I never felt anything for the Matrix movies I just now thought of another uninspired reference
[3:00:19] <derap41> not anymore pal
[3:00:19] <Naxura> It makes you feel like you're having a stroke or some shit
[3:00:24] <gyrogogozeppeli> Dignity?
[3:00:27] <HypeArbalest> I always thought oh we get more help
[3:00:27] <$ThePuddingDead> @FrostMass22 I knew what you meant, judge him by his work and all that
[3:00:32] <mercado94> Hopes and Dreams
[3:00:33] <%mostundesired> I'm 80% sure Paige always feels like she's having a stroke.
[3:00:37] <Hawkbone_> Remember to check on Hank, he is doing Conners coin trick in the corner
[3:00:38] <%maskedriderhero> I think the issue is what you view emotions as. For humans, emotions are just chemical responses to stimuli, for an android, it would just be a programmed response to a stimuli. Or to you, are emotions some greater thing beyond just chemicals and neural impulses?
[3:00:39] <+smargh1015> im the guy who does his job, you must be the other guy
[3:00:39] <Naxura> That's fair.
[3:00:40] <goose_attack_almanac> Oh here's the other unnecessarily aggressive federal worker
[3:00:40] <Mr_Strut> Kiss my ass, toaster!

[3:00:59] <Naxura> well, the difference lies in the evocation, right?

[3:02:02] <%HorseChange> I guess it's plausible that he's never looked at himself without his skin.....????
[3:02:07] <DraxTD> you didn't even try
[3:02:09] <%RafflesiaA> Trying is hard
[3:02:09] <derap41> gotta have you solve it somehow

[3:02:16] <DedlokPM> "HOW DID THEY KNOW IT WAS ME?"
[3:02:17] <gyrogogozeppeli> Are these the WATCH DOGS?
[3:02:22] <HypeArbalest> Like cover it up with your skin adaptations you know they have
[3:02:25] <+FrostMass22> David Cage, honestly, did not try with this story
[3:02:25] <TikanZK> HANKS SHIRT WAS DIFFERENT IN THE INTRO TO THIS SCENE WOW NICE JOB DAVID
[3:02:32] <Naxura> "oh shit, you can see a reflection of me in the TV"
[3:02:34] <%maskedriderhero> But whats the difference between a person smiling because their brain is telling them are happy, and an android smiling because his programming is telling them they are happy?
[3:02:49] <DedlokPM> @maskedriderhero chemicals
[3:02:51] <%HorseChange> I make my toaster do homework because my wife left me
[3:02:51] <Fathuran> @HorseChange Lol yeah, he was all "I'm gonna be so COOOOL" and... oh. limesNo
[3:02:53] <Naxura> because the programming is just tripping flags
[3:02:54] <%mostundesired> @maskedriderhero A brain does not tell someone they are happy, a brain REACTS
[3:02:55] <Hawkbone_> @maskedriderhero One isn't chemicals
[3:02:59] <%badmr7> he could have put pantyhose over his head and it would have been better
[3:03:00] <Endocrom> Tell her, Pat
[3:03:02] <Naxura> the flags say "run smile,exe"
[3:03:06] <OwlLightningMage> You answered your own question
[3:03:07] <DracaenaLeaf> Time to die
[3:03:10] <SGrim> @maskedriderhero one is a mear computer, and the other is a silicon computer.
[3:03:11] <+FrostMass22> @maskedriderhero Because the android is imitating behavior. say what you will about chemicals, but they are real
[3:03:12] <ebonifragaria> @Naxura that's what your brain is doing
[3:03:12] <$MagickBurritoh> GO ROOFTOP
[3:03:12] <aiyobro> Outlaw star is a fun show the outlaw star's original name is xgp and melphina's is X0 A2C
[3:03:13] <Naxura> and "voice laughter,exe
[3:03:13] <Mr_Strut> A brain naturally allows a person to be happy. A robot should never be happy.
[3:03:13] <CatmanIX> pretty sure the reason he took his skin off was to prove he was an android tbf
[3:03:17] <SGrim> meat* FUCK
[3:03:18] <%maskedriderhero> @mostundesired A human doesn't react unless their brain tells them to react
[3:03:21] <gyrogogozeppeli> Hannibal?
[3:03:22] <LiquidMathew> Hank does the coin trick if you watch him
[3:03:22] <DedlokPM> @Hawkbone_ or both are chemicals, just different kinds
[3:03:23] <$ThePuddingDead> nope
[3:03:26] <derap41> They're made of meat
[3:03:30] <gustavozxd> the idea that a human could program a machine to be as complicated as the human brain is ridiculous
[3:03:32] <hntronium> OH I NEVER GOT THIS
[3:03:32] <DraxTD> ...this is... new
[3:03:33] <mercado94> WHAT
[3:03:33] <Twoiis> New content for Pat
[3:03:34] <gyrogogozeppeli> LUL
[3:03:34] <Hellarussian> does not compute
[3:03:36] <heatrashes> ;_;
[3:03:38] <+smargh1015> Hey Princess
[3:03:40] <Naxura> I may have switched sides, oh no....
[3:03:40] <mercado94> I have never seen this
[3:03:41] <%Mysnion> HOW DOES CONNOR NOT KNOW
[3:03:41] <%AncelDeLambert> you had a face mask on, dumbass
[3:03:41] <gyrogogozeppeli> Oh im sorry you thought i remember you?
[3:03:43] <heatrashes> connor NO
[3:03:45] <%Mysnion> HE HAS THE MEMORIIESSS
[3:03:46] <+FrostMass22> Paige is good at videogame
[3:03:49] <gyrogogozeppeli> SUPER HURT
[3:03:50] <Naxura> I may have been convinced
[3:03:50] <derap41> some data is lost
[3:03:50] <Karhax> gun gun gun
[3:03:53] <LiquidMathew> memory transfer isn't perfect
[3:03:53] <heatrashes> this cop is sweet i love him
[3:03:55] <%Mysnion> THE MEMORIES THAT ARE RELATED TO THE CASE
[3:03:56] <%mostundesired> @maskedriderhero That's reductionist. A person can feel happy, but they consciously choose after the fact. Decisions, free will, yadda yadda
[3:03:57] <+Nomicro4u> FAINT SMILE
[3:03:57] <%HorseChange> I'd actually love and android revolution story in which they fail because they're so "innocent" and "pure"
[3:03:57] <%Kataguro> Public opinion go up?
[3:03:58] <plzza_kun> BEEP BOOP
[3:03:58] <HypeArbalest> Oh that's fucked up
[3:03:58] <Hellarussian> :)
[3:03:58] <$ThePuddingDead> well this was wasted
[3:03:59] <Kingdom_65> CONNOR IS CUTE
[3:03:59] <heatrashes> AWWW CONNOR
[3:04:02] <+I_speel_my_dreenk> <3
[3:04:03] <heatrashes> THIS WAS NICE
[3:04:04] <$MagickBurritoh> THAT REACTION
[3:04:04] <%texaporte> lol that scene did not matter at all lol
[3:04:06] <MrDonTacos_> clintFug
[3:04:08] <missingangle> d'awww
[3:04:08] <gyrogogozeppeli> That is the first legitimate thing that made me feel something in this game
[3:04:09] <couch_potato_Ed_Boy> Damn that guys has some huge ass lips...
[3:04:11] <Naxura> it super did not matter
[3:04:13] <mercado94> did paige died as connor during an interrogation? maybe thats why he said he doesnt rememer
[3:04:13] <%Kataguro> Connor is beyond precious
[3:04:14] <OwlLightningMage> COP HAS REMEMBERED THAT
[3:04:15] <TheFilth> and his android heart grew three sizes that day
[3:04:17] <+cvp5127> CAGE HATES IT
[3:04:20] <Naxura> he just went right back to his idle animation
[3:04:20] <DracaenaLeaf> Saved
[3:04:20] <Fuggins4U> it's so weird that this thing might actually be good
[3:04:21] <%ssjklyco> Why not explain "Oh, you must mean my double"
[3:04:21] <%HorseChange> Bryan Dechart killin it
[3:04:23] <SGrim> @PeachSaliva if you'd managed to not fuck up, that scene would be much better,
[3:04:25] <%Sinister_Aglet> pat knows what is about to go down lol
[3:04:25] <Chaoko99> @OwlLightningMage what did he remember? I forgot.
[3:04:27] <+smargh1015> thats two humans that like androids so far
[3:04:28] <LiquidMathew> LOOK AT HANK
[3:04:28] <derap41> If anything most of the actors are very good
[3:04:29] <%texaporte> "Ii don't remember you" "thanks for saving me anyway"
[3:04:32] <Hawkbone_> Cage definitely didn't write that scene
[3:04:40] <%happyface699> That was the best moment of all his games
[3:04:44] <OwlLightningMage> I don't know either
[3:04:44] <skeleklng> TELL HER SHE HAS TO PICK ONE OR THR OTHER PLS
[3:04:45] <Naxura> Well, I appreciated the debate
[3:04:48] <derap41> shame bout the script they have to work with
[3:04:50] <Chaoko99> "I like dogs."
[3:04:55] <Naxura> good on ya for staying civil, my dudes.
[3:05:04] <enoughmold> @couch_potato_Ed_Boy those were some big soup coolers
[3:05:12] <energywarning> but where's the gun they used to shoot the speech?
[3:05:23] <couch_potato_Ed_Boy> @enoughmold LUL LUL LUL
[3:05:31] <%maskedriderhero> I personally just don't see the point in making a difference. If a machine becomes intelligent enough and advanced enough to start wanting things like rights and personal freedoms, I see no reason not to give it to them.
[3:05:33] <ebonifragaria> @Naxura The human brain, while unbelievably complicated, is a lot more "programmed" than you might think. I don't think that makes it meaningless, though
[3:05:34] <+Svanyr> fuckin .45 cal rifles
[3:05:36] <%HorseChange> @Chaoko99 Why would ANYONe say that?!
[3:05:36] <DedlokPM> What's that smell? :) IT'S BLUD! mogsSmile
[3:05:43] <MSN04_Sazabi> PAIGE PLEASE
[3:05:44] <$RutilusMonachus> How does Paige always look everywhere except where she needs to?
[3:05:45] <aiyobro> Guys need to watch more 'Outlaw star' the intro and endings are worth the admission
[3:05:54] <%HorseChange> GUNTHOUGH
[3:05:56] <$RutilusMonachus> It's like a magical power she has
[3:06:00] <Hawkbone_> @maskedriderhero Yeah but we made them so shouldn't we be better than them?
[3:06:01] <PanicSwytch> PEW PEW PEW
[3:06:02] <Naxura> what *really* matters
[3:06:05] <Happy_Karl> Fully semi-automatic hand rifles.
[3:06:09] <Naxura> is, does a set of all sets contain itself?
[3:06:10] <DracaenaLeaf> Oh no
[3:06:14] <gyrogogozeppeli> Stop doing that
[3:06:14] <%mostundesired> LICK LICK
[3:06:15] <Hawkbone_> Hope this isn't Chris' blood
[3:06:19] <Chaoko99> @HorseChange Because it's relatable and it's still not clear if cage is a human being.
[3:06:21] <+Theprimerib> CONNOR!
[3:06:22] <%maskedriderhero> @Hawkbone No. Your parents made you, does that make them better than you?
[3:06:23] <+Nomicro4u> MUST TASTE MYSTERIOUS LIQUID
[3:06:25] <DraxTD> robot aids
[3:06:25] <derap41> Stop tasting the blood connor
[3:06:27] <+xohailey_> How do u like the game?
[3:06:29] <+AXL808> yum, blue raspberry
[3:06:29] <OwlLightningMage> The toasters want rights
[3:06:31] <Chaoko99> Remember the "David Cage is a lizardman" meme?
[3:06:32] <gustavozxd> he should just awkwardly lick the wall
[3:06:32] <slothslayer828> whats that taste?
[3:06:33] <Chaoko99> Good times.
[3:06:36] <+Nomicro4u> Connor must you lick everything?
[3:06:37] <%HorseChange> @Chaoko99 I was impersonating Cage, hehe
[3:06:39] <%happyface699> @hawkbone_ You were almost a Jill sandwich
[3:06:43] <$MagickBurritoh> the boolet holes
[3:06:46] <PanicSwytch> MMMM BLU BLOOD
[3:06:50] <Naxura> richevansAIDS,mpeg
[3:06:52] <Hawkbone_> @maskedriderhero My parents didn't invent humans, but humans did invent androids. We are basically god to them.
[3:06:52] <+LogothX> hank is trying to do the coin trick
[3:06:56] <BourneWarrior> JILL SANDWICH
[3:07:00] <OwlLightningMage> Hank is the master of unlocking
[3:07:09] <%GeneralSCPatton> @rutilusmonachus I've said it before, her Stand rewrites reality to put her objective exactly where she isn't looking.
[3:07:12] <Chaoko99> @HorseChange Remember that old joke about David Caage being a lizard man, because he doesn't understand how human beings act.
[3:07:12] <derap41> huh .45 caliber rifles
[3:07:12] <%happyface699> Jill sandwich
[3:07:15] <Endocrom> Tell her about them being points of no return
[3:07:15] <Hawkbone_> STOP! DON'T OPEN THAT DOOR!
[3:07:16] <+Tenchi_G> go to the kitchen
[3:07:16] <$MagickBurritoh> ROOFTOP
[3:07:32] <+smargh1015> Androids are really powerful, especially against living things
[3:07:34] <%Djinnazz> you CAN check the roof too
[3:07:35] <Bouldus> GO KITCHEN
[3:07:37] <%JenovasPuppet> Kitchen!
[3:07:42] <Karhax> kitchen
[3:07:46] <%AncelDeLambert> oooooh what's she gonna do!
[3:07:46] <Bouldus> KITCHEN CAN BE CUUUUUUTE
[3:07:46] <%Djinnazz> just not the one thing up there.
[3:07:47] <hntronium> ROOF
[3:07:47] <%JenovasPuppet> Simon says leave him the fuck alone!
[3:07:48] <%Sinister_Aglet> Pat trying to help so hard
[3:07:48] <OwlLightningMage> What a kitchen!
[3:07:50] <hntronium> MUST RAID
[3:07:52] <Hawkbone_> Play the Kitchen demo!
[3:07:52] <Bouldus> slash sad
[3:07:55] <derap41> Pat say what you did
[3:07:55] <LiquidMathew> WATCH HANK
[3:07:56] <%tacostarvedbeast> pat tell her to use the force
[3:08:01] <+FrostMass22> Demon on the roof!
[3:08:03] <Happy_Karl> Those .45 caliber rifles are weird unless they are using a larger caliber specifically to do more damage to androids.
[3:08:03] <%Sinister_Aglet> Good effort Pat
[3:08:05] <derap41> ok never mind
[3:08:05] <%mostundesired> OH FUCK YEAH
[3:08:07] <heatrashes> man the roof is so much better though
[3:08:08] <+FrostMass22> Honk!
[3:08:08] <LiquidMathew> RIP CONNOR
[3:08:13] <$ThePuddingDead> oh boy
[3:08:14] <side_effect> this should be interesting
[3:08:16] <slothslayer828> Rip
[3:08:17] <+tigerfang86> CONNOR BIG DEAD
[3:08:18] <%AncelDeLambert> will Connor survive?
[3:08:18] <%maskedriderhero> @Hawkbone And to a lot of humans, god doesn't really matter. Just because we make them doesn't mean we should ignore what they want WHEN they start wanting things. It's like saying humans are allowed to abuse dogs because we made them what they are today.
[3:08:19] <%JenovasPuppet> un-RIP Marcus
[3:08:20] <%HorseChange> PUZZLE PUZZLE PUZZLE
[3:08:26] <%Virokwet> big cop time

[3:08:30] <LiquidMathew> Connor is 100% dead
[3:08:33] <hntronium> One of them's a bitch'
[3:08:38] <+FrostMass22> Music in this game is so good
[3:08:41] <Luesagna00> @peachsaliva dont answer paiges questions pat (why she asking so damn many in this kind of game???)
[3:08:46] <%happyface699> Connor die
[3:08:48] <skeleklng> fug
[3:08:50] <OwlLightningMage> Toasters want rights
[3:08:55] <HypeArbalest> WOW!

[3:08:55] <mercado94> BULLSHIT
[3:08:56] <FourthAve> Watch the eyes

[3:09:14] <%rdark_ksu> ooooooooh boi
[3:09:14] <Naxura> oh henlo
[3:09:14] <+FrostMass22> I have a question-who is this guy? Was he originally in the group? Where did he come from?
[3:09:17] <%HorseChange> Eugh! Why does this game have to be this good?

[3:10:40] <$flying_man_3> you dont ASK a security camera what it saw. you just look at the tape
[3:10:40] <%Kataguro> STRESS
[3:10:42] <gryffinp> I mean his fuckin blinky light is red
[3:10:43] <%mostundesired> TORTURE
[3:10:44] <swansong118> VIOLENCE
[3:10:44] <gyrogogozeppeli> TORTURE
[3:10:44] <Naxura> for once, page has decent eyes
[3:10:44] <$Dotta5> his name in Memory
[3:10:44] <$MagickBurritoh> do androids need to blink?
[3:10:46] <%maskedriderhero> @Hawkbone_ I don't agree there, why should it be acknowledged? It doesn't change anything, and just comes off as pointless arrogance and egotism. Plus, if we break it down to semantics, it's not the human race that invented androids, it's one person and a bunch of factories that did it, so technically, only one person is god to them, and every other human isn't better by default.
[3:10:47] <+Nomicro4u> TORTURE
[3:10:48] <OwlLightningMage> These lines don't make sense on toasters
[3:10:48] <+future_ry> just kill them all

Their WAAAGH!! energy works like tape or glue and just keeps everything moving smoothly instead of blowing up under them. It does have some reality altering abilities, but it's very tiny, and only majorly effective when theres LOTS of Orks around.

[3:55:30] <Bouldus> PET HIM
[3:55:32] <Eepravenous> paige is fine under stress when pat isnt yelling at her
[3:55:33] <+badchoice5> Remember that the cop probably looked at a bunch of houses and had no reason to suspect you, so he would easily overlook little things
[3:55:34] <gustavozxd> I can't believe she's doing better than matt and woolie

[3:57:05] <gyrogogozeppeli> "Positive"
[3:57:10] <mercado94> positive panic?
[3:57:17] <+badchoice5> Because Paige has no problem pulling a gun on Marnie in real life, video games are different
[3:57:21] <%Archer2150> Doesnt seem that positive to me
[3:57:23] <derap41> No wonder you kill so many women
[3:57:25] <Phalanx_Soul> is that why Pat got pelted with a paper towel roll
[3:57:25] <%skm742> Marnie doesn't have a timer
[3:57:26] <Bouldus> fuck you nature
[3:57:26] <$Dotta5> lupus panic
[3:57:31] <+LowBatteryLife> Paige has a lightning-speed mom arm.
[3:57:33] <%YourFavoriteShiba> "Positive" panic
[3:57:35] <%moranprime> Dropkick that Tornado
[3:57:35] <%Paralurx> The hell is "positive panic?"

[3:57:37] <Mittensbro> basically she become stronger as she panic
[3:57:40] <Laironx3> duDudu duDudu
[3:57:40] <%SaltyDongs> This is true and can be confirmed by the body count of endless women left behind her
[3:57:41] <Endocrom> Who's Marnie?
[3:57:42] <aiyobro> Is everyone else simultaneously playing Detroit: Become Human right now????
[3:57:42] <SchroedingersFerret> She R1 super good
[3:57:43] <ebonifragaria> So instead of locking up, you enter hero mode?
[3:57:44] <TheAkex> paige gets positive darkest dungeon stress quirk
[3:57:44] <+axellogic> I want a game about Paige fighting Tornadoes now
[3:57:44] <%redstonej> near death Paige story incoming

[3:57:57] <gyrogogozeppeli> Paige is Pa Kent
[3:57:58] <flattopswag> who the hell runs from a car crash
[3:58:01] <Luesagna00> @peachsaliva tornato im a FUCK YOU UP!!!
[3:58:01] <Mittensbro> thus being the reason why she can oneshot some bosses in Bloodborne
[3:58:02] <%rdark_ksu> or maybe use a phone like a human
[3:58:02] <derap41> !
[3:58:02] <%Divryne> YEYEYE.
[3:58:02] <Phalanx_Soul> the fight or flight reaction

[3:58:09] <+Nomicro4u> Stain approves
[3:58:12] <SailingSaturn> @TheReservation cirHi
[3:58:14] <Mechz71> Paige would die first in a scary movie
[3:58:15] <SchroedingersFerret> Hullo today
[3:58:16] <%moranprime> And then do a sick izuna drop on the car that crashed
[3:58:17] <slothslayer828> fight car crash
[3:58:17] <+axellogic> Oh no you mean its a porn game about fucking tornadoes?

[3:58:21] <Prism_Wing> There's a character with a psychic power like that in a manga called Psyren lol.
[3:58:21] <aiyobro> i fought deku in soul cal 6
[3:58:22] <OkamiDude15> well theres a fine line between bravery and stupidity woopsThink
[3:58:23] <OwlLightningMage> LEARN THE LORE
[3:58:24] <valriot> GINGER NARUTO
[3:58:24] <%ssjklyco> She does break herself
[3:58:26] <+badchoice5> Paige is a panic-savant
[3:58:28] <+FrostMass22> Just like Deku
[3:58:29] <Bouldus> Paiges Str is faith based Kappa
[3:58:30] <TheBlankAce> Is Paige a genome soldier?
[3:58:34] <captainthunderwolf> @PeachSaliva I get it, I've got a fucked-up panic response that actually emotionally flatlines me, and it feels really bizarre.
[3:58:34] <%Kataguro> Red Himawari
[3:58:42] <$Dotta5> yeah how was that panic when you spilled that drink on the couch?
[3:58:42] <%Mornaka> I gave Elmo a gun #elmoments
[3:58:45] <aiyobro> NANOMACHINES
[3:58:47] <%skm742> <3
[3:58:48] <+AXL808> she has bones of glass
[3:58:48] <+BDKatsumaru> Don't make me panic, you won't like me when I'm panicked.
[3:58:56] <flattopswag> So does everyone
[3:58:57] <ebonifragaria> Peach panic activates muscles
[3:58:57] <+FrostMass22> The invisible clock is her womb
[3:59:00] <OwlLightningMage> Paige would get fucked by Genthru
[3:59:01] <%Paralurx> timers, underwater, or NIGHT TIME
[3:59:06] <+badchoice5> Marnie timer: 2 minutes remaining
[3:59:06] <%Divryne> UNDERWATER GHOST BASE.
[3:59:07] <SailingSaturn> Like that Heavy Rain scene cirLaugh

[3:59:15] <gekizenbu> underwater GHOST BASE
[3:59:15] <Bouldus> yea im good at swimming, i hate it though
[3:59:17] <%rdark_ksu> wern't you on the fucking swim team?
[3:59:17] <+Nomicro4u> Paige passed all those Marnie QTEs
[3:59:24] <%SiameseSneeze> WATER SUCKS, Gatorade is better!
[3:59:27] <%Divryne> LUL
[3:59:30] <+BDKatsumaru> Water is evil and it always tries to kill you.
[3:59:30] <%RafflesiaA> I can't judge Paige on the underwater thing because I too can't stand underwater stuff
[3:59:30] <OkamiDude15> @gekizenbu dont forget that its chinese
[3:59:35] <Endocrom> Doesn't swimming involve turning your head quickly? Isn't that not a Paige friendly thing?
[3:59:38] <captainthunderwolf> @flattopswag Nah, like I literally don't have emotions for like several hours or days afterwards. Psychologists think it's part of my autism.
[3:59:38] <%Kataguro> Shut the fuck up, North
[3:59:39] <derap41> Yeah kill

[3:59:54] <OwlLightningMage> North needs the blood of babies for lube
[3:59:54] <gyrogogozeppeli> WOW
[3:59:54] <pandapanzerai> Violence is ALWAYS the answer
[3:59:55] <%SiameseSneeze> North is a piece of shit, and you should totally bang her
[3:59:55] <Megapikman132> you were going to kill him, north
[3:59:57] <%Mornaka> I hate North
[3:59:57] <%Djinnazz> WHy are his hips moving so weird?

[4:04:22] <$ThePuddingDead> how the fuck are you superior? you have the physical fortitude of a bounty paper towel roll!
[4:04:22] <+Gravity_Gunner> Remember the place the woman in Heavy Rain lived in with showers for eighty five people?

[4:04:26] <%MightyMaxT> You're all FREE now
[4:04:28] <wydamn> the only reason it might be this way is if there was curfew, but I'm pretty sure there's no mention of a curfew until later in the game
[4:04:28] <ShadeTheNovice> Your free for me
[4:04:31] <+LowBatteryLife> You're free to play the same canned animation as the last three robits.

[4:04:33] <missingangle> I wish one of them said "But I like shoveling, actually."

[4:05:03] <+LogothX> goin nutsz
[4:05:03] <$Piemono> Would lower level androids even have the processing power to behave like a human
[4:05:03] <%Sadira_snack_attack> thats the real question is Marcus actually freeing them or is he the equivalent of the Borg queen?
[4:05:05] <%maskedriderhero> Free to commit crimes!
[4:05:05] <+Gravity_Gunner> He just freed Sonequa Martin-Green
[4:05:06] <+FrostMass22> Execute <Slavery>

[4:05:21] <%Archer2150> F
[4:05:23] <+badchoice5> Except in that movie they were actually freed, here they just experience a change of ownership
[4:05:24] <Hydrapissed> lol execute <slavery>
[4:05:25] <%ssjklyco> I will take the choice away from you and tell you you're free to do what I tell you.
[4:05:25] <%MightyMaxT> Go North, ha ha ha
[4:05:25] <+Belakitu> PogChamp I didn't know it was EVO already
[4:05:26] <fingalights> Freedom isn't free
[4:05:34] <%Kataguro> sipsipSipsipblind
[4:05:35] <%AncelDeLambert> LUL
[4:05:38] <%Sadira_snack_attack> @captainthunderwolf yup I think so too
[4:05:38] <%legendfather_of_giants> yes
[4:05:39] <captainthunderwolf> YOU ARE MERCHANDISE
[4:05:40] <OkamiDude15> wake up android sheeple
[4:05:40] <gyrogogozeppeli> THATS BECAUSE YOU ARE MERCHANDISE
[4:05:42] <mayorrev> @PeachSaliva Paige is turning androids into warframe
[4:05:42] <$Piemono> I mean they are merchandise though
[4:05:43] <Eepravenous> diddy dum diddy do
[4:05:43] <SailingSaturn> You're a robot NotLikeThis
[4:05:43] <%AncelDeLambert> PITY THE SEX BOTS!
[4:05:45] <+LogothX> what happened to spooky?
[4:05:45] <+FrostMass22> @sadira_snack_attack Supposedly they gain free will, but the problem is that every single android joins him without question
[4:05:48] <%Kataguro> No shit, genius. You're a BUILT robot
[4:05:49] <Hydrapissed> LOL they are though
[4:05:50] <%YourFavoriteShiba> Freedom costs a buck o' five.
[4:05:51] <+Gravity_Gunner> Actually, if Sonequa Martin-Green is an Android that explains a lot about her acting
[4:05:52] <$ThePuddingDead> oh shit!
[4:05:52] <Hawkbone_> What Markus doesn't realize is that he was accidentally just lowering their prices to $0, he didn't actually free anyone
[4:05:52] <missingangle> Yes because you're nothing but pretty roombas
[4:05:53] <%Mornaka> Pat's in a jaunty mood
[4:05:54] <mayorrev> TIMER
[4:05:54] <gyrogogozeppeli> HOLY SHIT THIS "WE ARE TOOLS" SHIT IS SUCH BULLSHIT
[4:05:57] <OwlLightningMage> YES, TOASTERS
[4:05:57] <captainthunderwolf> YOU WERE DESIGNED AS MERCHANDISE
[4:06:00] <$ThePuddingDead> time, and his BULLSHIT
[4:06:01] <+LowBatteryLife> Stop asking questions that might complicate the story! Just accept what we're putting on your screen! Eat it up, idiot!
[4:06:07] <+Nomicro4u> how come they don't have any fat androids?
[4:06:08] <deadredeyez> get lazer eye surgery its cheep and go to doctor bocman
[4:06:09] <%RafflesiaA> You are items created to be sold, yes that is literally merchandise
[4:06:10] <snorlaxbud> singing she's a blind a diddy blind diddy do
[4:06:10] <Mr_Strut> Paige should play Antechamber.
[4:06:11] <derap41> wow that security grate does noting
[4:06:14] <+badchoice5> 10 minutes, more than enough tim to enslave all the androids
[4:06:16] <%happyface699> Wouldn’t there be some that were like oh I’m free now, I guess I’ll go smoke weed with my owner and just carry on but more humanlike
[4:06:17] <person181> hopefully it'll be enough
[4:06:18] <%SaltyDongs> It's fine just do it
[4:06:20] <gyrogogozeppeli> LITERALLY DESIGNED TO BE TOOLS, YOU HOOKER BOT
[4:06:21] <captainthunderwolf> @LowBatteryLife Just consume product and get excited for new products!
[4:06:23] <%Archer2150> Ten minutes, more than enough to kill anything that moves
[4:06:24] <srkAres> her sense of fucking what LUL
[4:06:24] <Graxe_> So how does Paige feel about Majora's Mask?
[4:06:26] <DatAsuna> Paige has a sense of direction?
[4:06:28] <gustavozxd> turn off the alarms but blow everything up and make noise anyway
[4:06:30] <%wheke_> we're fucked
[4:06:30] <+FrostMass22> The difference between them is that Markus had a loving father figure that actually cared for him
[4:06:33] <$ThePuddingDead> i.e. bitch shut up
[4:06:41] <%Mornaka> @Nomicro4u fat androids would be more expensive to make
[4:06:41] <+badchoice5> HACK ALL THE IPS
[4:06:44] <derap41> Where's your laser glass cuter now!
[4:06:45] <Endocrom> Analyse store window...
[4:06:46] <+LowBatteryLife> I love brands, and products!
[4:06:52] <+FrostMass22> Hack all IPS simultaneously
[4:06:57] <captainthunderwolf> @LowBatteryLife Very cool!
[4:07:00] <gyrogogozeppeli> Parkour.exe
[4:07:04] <$ThePuddingDead> like a cat in midair
[4:07:05] <gyrogogozeppeli> Parkour . exe
[4:07:06] <OwlLightningMage> Slave all IPs
[4:07:07] <$ThePuddingDead> and failing
[4:07:19] <+FrostMass22> Don t ask questions, just consume product and then wait for next product
[4:07:21] <rytisone> slam dunk that sucker
[4:07:22] <+Nomicro4u> Fat androids would be like Vans
[4:07:30] <+Nomicro4u> More storage room for goodies
[4:07:31] <OwlLightningMage> RKO the drone
[4:07:33] <$ThePuddingDead> CHAOS DUNK THAT R2 UNIT!
[4:07:41] <$Vilecrow> cheer250 Hey Paige and Pat, thanks for the entertainment and being so bumbling cool. I just wanted to suggest that you play To The Moon. It is a really good game with a good story to it. I might even have a steam code for it in my archives. Anyways continue to have fun playing as Sigma taking over all the Reploids. Terra is best Waifu
[4:07:42] <OkamiDude15> @FrostMass22 i clapped
[4:07:42] <captainthunderwolf> @FrostMass22 Next product is coming, get excited!
[4:07:49] <%superorangerobin> Androids cannot be filled with fat evil
[4:07:50] <+badchoice5> Reach through the network and crush the robot's free will circuits
[4:07:51] <+FrostMass22> but Markus is black so that's a crime
[4:07:58] <%rdark_ksu> please relax. its literally not real there are no consequences
[4:07:58] <%skm742> t i m e r s
[4:08:00] <%SaltyDongs> How are the robots not just terminating everything and rulers of the world with time stop
[4:08:10] <+Gravity_Gunner> But that’s a problem, if they make hooker bots then what about hooker bots for men who like larger girls?
[4:08:13] <derap41> In today's society we have face scanners how isn't that drone screaming in alarm right now
[4:08:20] <%Sinister_Aglet> paige's kryptonite = shadow puzzle on a timer
[4:08:22] <+lotionfactory> I pre ordered this game and haven’t even played it yet so I came here for motivation lol
[4:08:24] <Endocrom> Just get up there and wait
[4:08:28] <DatAsuna> fatty chasers have to wait
[4:08:30] <%RafflesiaA> @SaltyDongs They haven't figured out how to move in the frozen time yet
[4:08:31] <captainthunderwolf> @SaltyDongs Markus is too much of a bitch to choose the Chaos path, and everyone else needs to wait until later in the story to unlock the Freedom path.
[4:08:35] <$ThePuddingDead> shhh
[4:08:38] <mercado94> LUL
[4:08:38] <DatAsuna> Just like lawbringer mains have to wait for a buff
[4:08:40] <%YourFavoriteShiba> Why indeed
[4:08:42] <+Nomicro4u> Who thought it was a good idea to make android children
[4:08:47] <gyrogogozeppeli> Markus Ecko's Getting Up : Androids Under Pressure
[4:08:51] <+LowBatteryLife> Paige is very smart and strong and good at solving problems, we are so proud
[4:09:00] <OwlLightningMage> MORTIS TOASTER
[4:09:01] <DatAsuna> Android children would totally be a thing.
[4:09:02] <forgetme000> wouldn't this be cooler if you could just climb this like a normal video game lol?
[4:09:06] <Endocrom> alarm sent
[4:09:07] <%AncelDeLambert> HONK HONK HONK ALERT ALERT
[4:09:08] <%redstonej> you are free
[4:09:10] <+Gravity_Gunner> @lotionfactory I won’t tell you that it’s like 75% off on the PlayStation store right now then. mikeliveSkeletor
[4:09:11] <%The_Lady_Alustriel> Wouldn't the cops just show up
[4:09:11] <mercado94> does this thinks doesnt have cameras?
[4:09:11] <DatAsuna> PLus better stories revolve around the concept
[4:09:18] <%Sadira_snack_attack> and the cops are instantly alerted
[4:09:19] <Endocrom> DOOR
[4:09:20] <mercado94> things*
[4:09:20] <+badchoice5> Violence turns North on
[4:09:27] <+d00msdaydan> even robot violence is enough to get north going
[4:09:29] <+FackinCrazy> wouldnt the police immediately be notified
[4:09:29] <DatAsuna> Just cause detroit has one that's bad doesn't make it a poison concept
[4:09:29] <captainthunderwolf> @Gravity_Gunner The real question, and I'm not even being facetious, is why none of those hooker bots were furries, had four boobs, or were eight-foot tall giantesses. Let's be real, the internet has ruined normal sexuality by this point in the future.
[4:09:30] <+lotionfactory> @gravity_gunner I know that’s why I have to play it lmao
[4:09:32] <%The_Lady_Alustriel> why would the cops not show up to a downed drone
[4:09:38] <Endocrom> No, look at door.
[4:09:38] <rytisone> drone offline, cops on their way
[4:09:39] <%Mornaka> PANIC
[4:09:42] <+Hilleltaco> You killed a robot so she's like halfway to climax right now
[4:09:42] <+Gravity_Gunner> @badchoice5 She’s a hooker bot, everything turns her on.
[4:09:43] <Graxe_> The police drone should have immediately called the cops on Markus impact.
[4:09:46] <couch_potato_Ed_Boy> David Cages It says Nothing: Androids Under New Ownership
[4:09:50] <gyrogogozeppeli> Panic Paige
[4:09:51] <%rdark_ksu> walk forward!!!
[4:09:51] <CastellanVon> JUST MOVE FORWARD
[4:09:52] <mr_slaide> DO IT YOU NERD
[4:09:56] <%happyface699> @lotionfactory you made a mistake we live on
[4:10:01] <captainthunderwolf> @The_Lady_Alustriel Uhhhhh, because it's down? Who programs a robot to work when it's DOWN? Cops? Pfffffffft.
[4:10:01] <%YourFavoriteShiba> ALL OF THE PANIC WITH 9 MINUTES!
[4:10:06] <SwindlerOfProgress> Markus doesn't know yet.
[4:10:10] <+skizzuto> Paige anxiety go big up
[4:10:15] <+Nomicro4u> He has time to windowshop
[4:10:15] <Endocrom> Well this will be interesting
[4:10:16] <OwlLightningMage> YOU'RE BECOMING THE ONE
[4:10:16] <snorlaxbud> The wall?
[4:10:18] <gyrogogozeppeli> youll soon be my slave
[4:10:21] <%Ell1ot> HOW CAN THIS BE?!

[4:10:26] <%Sadira_snack_attack> thats an expensive mannequinn
[4:10:26] <CastellanVon> You will become my sex slave
[4:10:31] <bleugh> PANIC PAIGE
[4:10:31] <+Gravity_Gunner> @captainthunderwolf You’re right, they’d basically have to have a customisation station in the brothel.
[4:10:31] <%The_Lady_Alustriel> captainthunderwolf Yeah cops ain't got shit thats true
[4:10:34] <Graxe_> Soon, you, too, be infected.
[4:10:40] <SwindlerOfProgress> She analyzed the store window. LUL
[4:10:42] <+LowBatteryLife> Something something Pinocchio android children Spielberg.
[4:10:47] <+Cyberwrisket> NotLikeThis oh god 9 minutes there's NO TIME
[4:10:48] <faegbeard> what could those yellows mean
[4:10:54] <DatAsuna> Just run away

[4:10:57] <DatAsuna> like woolie would
[4:10:59] <$ThePuddingDead> A Build-A-Whore Workshop?
[4:10:59] <+badchoice5> HOW CAN THIS BE
[4:11:00] <captainthunderwolf> I'd like to point out that none of these androids are actually sapient until Markus awakens them, so he's literally creating victims and forcing them to exist in this world by "helping them" like that.
[4:11:03] <mercado94> THIS IS IMPOSIBLE
[4:11:06] <%Mornaka> cryDDOS cryTrash cryDDOS
[4:11:09] <Mr_Strut> She'll never make it

[4:11:38] <%AncelDeLambert> why on EARTH does it go out of teh building?
[4:11:42] <$ReversalPsychology> we do it
[4:11:43] <captainthunderwolf> @The_Lady_Alustriel David Cage is mad on-point. When would cops in America have technology? Or weapons? Or technology to help their weapons.
[4:11:46] <+Nomicro4u> I wonder how much she would freak out if Pat antagonized her
[4:11:48] <%happyface699> @lotionfactory Life goes on

[4:12:17] <%Archer2150> eight minutes more than enough to kill anything that panics
[4:12:18] <gyrogogozeppeli> Because gameplay will happen when Cage wants it to
[4:12:20] <$ThePuddingDead> hail hydra
[4:12:23] <captainthunderwolf> @Gravity_Gunner I'd like to think that each additional dick is slightly cheaper, so you can strike prime hooker-bot price efficiency with a specific number of phallic additions.
[4:12:26] <$ReversalPsychology> TAKE THEIR SOUL
[4:12:29] <%Sadira_snack_attack> we are the borg
[4:12:32] <aiyobro> assbot

[4:12:49] <+FackinCrazy> Put yop dick in it
[4:12:53] <Hawkbone_> Why are they wearing gloves
[4:12:53] <bleugh> wake up sheeple
[4:12:56] <%The_Lady_Alustriel> captainthunderwolf that's like 3 levels of technology more than they could realistically manage. GOTY
[4:12:58] <%AncelDeLambert> FUCKING MAGIC
[4:12:59] <JaydenSai> Magic
[4:13:01] <%ssjklyco> why are the androids wearing gloves?
[4:13:04] <+badchoice5> Yer a wizard, MArcus
[4:13:05] <%MightyMaxT> Markus the Magic Man with the Magic Hands
[4:13:10] <captainthunderwolf> Hey what's an innerloop? Shut up? I should shut up and consume product? Okay.
[4:13:14] <aiyobro> child sex bots are illegal = mad expensive
[4:13:15] <%The_Lady_Alustriel> North go North
[4:13:15] <andyspz> interloops brother
[4:13:24] <$ReversalPsychology> so we're supposed to assume each of the other teams also had access to those lines or what
[4:13:26] <+d00msdaydan> north is just fuckin running around like a headless chicken instead of doing anything at all to help
[4:13:26] <Logan_Jennings1> Mightymax is that a WC3 refrence eh? EH

[4:13:29] <%happyface699> I would love if he stuck both arms out at the same time changing them
[4:13:29] <OwlLightningMage> @ssjklyco Great question LUL
[4:13:42] <Endocrom> North go up so she will always be up to relationship level for THAT scene
[4:13:42] <%AncelDeLambert> pfffft, modifying a child droid to be sex-capable would be simplicity
[4:13:46] <captainthunderwolf> @The_Lady_Alustriel Fucking exactly. These guys have no tech at their disposal, which is probably why the synthetic humans are doing so well.
[4:13:48] <%AncelDeLambert> illegal, but fucking easy
[4:13:49] <+Gravity_Gunner> Why does he have the ability to do all of this? He was designed to care for a disabled man, not hack the universe.
[4:13:55] <%Sadira_snack_attack> assimilate them!
[4:13:57] <$ThePuddingDead> hail hydra
[4:13:59] <ShimmerFairy> When will Elmo get his turn at the controls?

[4:20:33] <Fathuran> Looking fondly back at his time with Manfred I see. limesLUL
[4:20:34] <+FrostMass22> Here's a philosophical quandary: is it moral for Markus to force other androids to gain free will, knowing their existences are only suffering?
[4:20:34] <dking0000> It is a consensual-blow now
[4:20:35] <hntronium> FUCK YOU YOU WERE

[4:21:17] <SwindlerOfProgress> Is it really, though?
[4:21:18] <derap41> How are you supposed to feel if you are forced to do what you would have done anyway?

[4:24:05] <gyrogogozeppeli> PEOPLE DEFEND THIS GAME LUL
[4:24:13] <Graxe_> But they're only doing what you're doing. They aren't making their own slogans and symbols.
[4:24:17] <%JenovasPuppet> But listen to the soaring music!

[4:24:35] <faegbeard> Markus marking the jew
[4:24:35] <Hawkbone_> The media will call the slogan "Obscure" no matter what you pick by the way. Which means the game thinks "we have a dream" is obscure
[4:24:38] <+DeaconBluesClues> if you smash all the signs do you get to fight robo-sans
[4:24:39] <+lotionfactory> Is this the very beginning of the game
[4:24:40] <DracaenaLeaf> I just noticed how threatening this music is
[4:24:41] <goose_attack_almanac> You're it.
[4:24:43] <+LowBatteryLife> I want to fuck the robo twink but I still hate this game
[4:24:45] <%AncelDeLambert> this graffiti makes no sense
[4:24:47] <%Kataguro> But you took these symbols off. This doesn't represent you

[4:25:26] <+badchoice5> Notice how Marcus makes the human into an android, symbolizing how HE has replaced humanity as the androids absolute master
[4:25:26] <+FrostMass22> Reminder: all androids are wearing weird Nazi armbands
[4:25:29] <SwindlerOfProgress> Now it's an android pointing condescendingly at another android?
[4:25:34] <%SuperCasualBoom> Free parking YEAH!!!
[4:25:36] <%happyface699> @captainthunderwolf OR how the first android to rise up is black
[4:25:38] <Graxe_> No one notices this.
[4:25:39] <%AncelDeLambert> BIG SIGN
[4:25:40] <captainthunderwolf> @rdark_ksu Imagine if the androids technically ran on the cloud for their primary functions, and by turning off CyberLife, they all die.
[4:25:49] <$ThePuddingDead> is he black tho?
[4:25:49] <%RafflesiaA> I like how he has the message just recorded in his head to upload into these fucking screens

[4:26:40] <+Mekhet09> This game is no fucking infamous.
[4:26:42] <bleugh> maybe they're programmed to be rebellious for the style

[4:26:54] <%JenovasPuppet> Totally planned out!
[4:26:55] <+badchoice5> If this game is available on PC, someone needs to mod in "BECOME AS GODS" as a selectable slogan
[4:26:55] <%Divryne> LAAAAAMMMMME.
[4:27:00] <$ThePuddingDead> SHUT UP, PEOPLE ARE TRYING TO SLEEP
[4:27:00] <Logan_Jennings1> PRE-PROGRAMED FOR THE SYMBOL
[4:27:01] <+Mekhet09> God I hate this game game more I see it replayed.
[4:27:02] <aiyobro> it's a rattlesnake
[4:27:02] <%rdark_ksu> its a future flag
[4:27:03] <Endocrom> Future holograms, how do they work? Who cares?
[4:27:04] <+Hilleltaco> It's like a weird hologram flag
[4:27:04] <missingangle> Because FUTURE

[4:35:31] <captainthunderwolf> @Mekhet09 I'm gonna be real, it's genuinely hard to avoid slavery allegories when you make an android story, and it's fucking hard enough that David Cage should not pretend to have tried at all.

[4:37:09] <%AncelDeLambert> the twist in Heavy Rain is worse than the twist here
[4:37:10] <%RafflesiaA> @superorangerobin As someone from Mississippi, this is the norm
[4:37:17] <captainthunderwolf> Remember when the game LIES to you?
[4:37:17] <%rdark_ksu> david cage should have to play his own shitty games
[4:37:17] <%Archer2150> Oh yeah the fucking cock store
[4:37:19] <captainthunderwolf> When it LIES?
[4:37:20] <DatAsuna> There's more than enough for third gig too
[4:37:25] <%AncelDeLambert> the twist here just makes you rethink a bunch of characters, the twist in Heavy Rain LIES
[4:37:26] <%Kataguro> Paige, please
[4:37:26] <captainthunderwolf> When it DIRECTLY LIES TO YOU?

[4:38:08] <Bouldus> Elmo so handsome
[4:38:09] <%RafflesiaA> @superorangerobin The roads in Jackson are generally bullshit. You'd think the fucking capitol of all cities would have some decent roads but nooo
[4:38:09] <gustavozxd> the fact that one of the playable characters does things you don't see and it's even slightly hinted at
[4:38:10] <%SiameseSneeze> sipsipHellmo

[4:38:49] <Rei964555> no it's not wtf
[4:38:52] <gustavozxd> Detroit is the one that hides it's flaws the best of the cageverse, it's pretty and has a good ost, but ohh almost everything else
[4:38:52] <bunbundabuni> dang
[4:38:54] <%happyface699> @captainthunderwolf Haven’t watched Jojo
[4:38:57] <%legendfather_of_giants> @PeachSaliva that's the Prc psychic

[4:39:01] <person181> nothing pat said is wrong
[4:39:02] <CopperTucker> Medium rare is correct
[4:39:02] <%SiameseSneeze> Candy Corn is the candy equivalent of poop, fight me
[4:39:04] <+d00msdaydan> the waaagh is the rad
[4:39:04] <faegbeard> Gork > Mork
[4:39:05] <captainthunderwolf> Gestalt field is the companion game to Replicant field.
[4:39:05] <Alseid> MEAT SHOULD BE WELL DONE AND EVERYTHING ELSE IS UNCOOKED
[4:39:05] <OkamiDude15> bacon is bad in large quantities
[4:39:09] <$TheSniperJoe> Summon Gork's BIG FOOT

[4:39:09] <derap41> ITS GORK n MORK!
[4:39:10] <+Nomicro4u> Elmo >.<
[4:39:14] <+Trekalone> It's Gork and Mork you heathen
[4:39:14] <Logan_Jennings1> Medium Rare is the only answer. If you like it more done you're eating a shoe fight me.
[4:39:16] <%spacekataz18> One's brutally cunning, the other cunningly brutal
[4:39:16] <%superorangerobin> Waagh is the most broken bullshit ever
[4:39:19] <+d00msdaydan> gork < mork i'll fucking bash your teef
[4:39:20] <%legendfather_of_giants> @PeachSaliva Gestalt Field is the Orc Psychic shit
[4:39:20] <%happyface699> @okamidude15 Same
[4:39:21] <%Mornaka> Fun fact: my name came from MORK
[4:39:26] <Bouldus> ones cunning and vicious, the other is vicious and cunning
[4:39:31] <+Gravity_Gunner> I am entirely anti-Orc. Stoke supporters are Orcs.
[4:39:33] <%animio> SMOrc
[4:39:39] <captainthunderwolf> @happyface699 It is pretty good. It's intentionally weird and random, and has a bunch of fun fights. If you go in expecting nonsense, you'll be pleased.
[4:39:40] <faegbeard> one hits you while you're not looking, the other hits you harder when you are
[4:39:47] <+Nomicro4u> ROOMBA RIGHTS

[4:39:55] <%happyface699> @captainthunderwolf Good that’s what I wanted
[4:39:59] <OwlLightningMage> THOSE ARE UGLY TOASTERS
[4:39:59] <%spacekataz18> Androids think roombas are lesser than them
[4:40:00] <%SiameseSneeze> How bad do you all think David Cages' coke problem is?
[4:40:01] <wydamn> or the ROBO-BIRDS
[4:40:05] <DatAsuna> Processing power and self identification
[4:40:05] <%Mornaka> NECRON RIGHTS
[4:40:14] <%Mornaka> GET OFF OUR LAWNS
[4:40:15] <Phalanx_Soul> I wonder if the older android models look like the kid from the movie mask
[4:40:16] <OwlLightningMage> PRETTY TOASTERS DESERVE RIGHTS
[4:40:20] <%legendfather_of_giants> Mechanicus Righrs WHEN
[4:40:20] <captainthunderwolf> Like, by their logic, drones are ANIMALS. You know what humans do? Feel empathy for ANIMALS.
[4:40:21] <LiquidMathew> Markus super says thats why
[4:40:28] <+LowBatteryLife> I like candy corn and I will fight you. I will lose. Every fight, and I will keep fighting.
[4:40:31] <faegbeard> If it was his true face why would he not go no-face more often
[4:40:40] <%legendfather_of_giants> It's EXPLICITLY a disguise
[4:40:43] <derap41> They did it because you have to find Markus
[4:40:43] <rytisone> cereal number
[4:40:44] <OwlLightningMage> Markus just curb stomped a puppy LUL
[4:40:51] <Mittensbro> Hold on a fuckin minute, why isn't every android in jericho faceless all the time?
[4:41:01] <captainthunderwolf> @faegbeard There was a specific number of whiteface inclusions they could have before it became a social issue.

[4:41:17] <%Pendragwn> @peachsaliva he turns off his face to show he's a robot because he is a unique model. with his face on he could be mistaken as human, easily

[4:41:22] <OwlLightningMage> Slutty Slut is the ultimate costume
[4:41:23] <captainthunderwolf> @Mittensbro Because David Cage doesn't do actual world-building, just random background facts that don't matter.
[4:41:23] <DavidSanChan> slutty master chief!
[4:41:25] <Worldbrand> it's like anime

[4:42:47] <wsintai> He's the Italian one
[4:42:48] <andyspz> named cumlord
[4:42:48] <+Snaketsu> i dunno if mark streamed since last time
[4:42:56] <+Gravity_Gunner> The only android who deserves rights: mikeliveLaughing
[4:42:59] <Intolerable> Bigoted Bill is my shit!
[4:43:03] <%Freelance7> They're right. I didn't .
[4:43:03] <captainthunderwolf> @happyface699 Alright, that was pretty alright.
[4:43:08] <Angry_Ev1L> ME stream wasn't that bad
[4:43:09] <rytisone> oh gawd, that Mass Effect stream
[4:43:09] <%skm742> aw, I love cumlord!
[4:43:11] <%Kataguro> Andromeda was rough
[4:43:12] <%RafflesiaA> They streamed Mass Effect?
[4:43:19] <DracaenaLeaf> yeah
[4:43:20] <%RafflesiaA> I need to see this
[4:43:21] <%The_Lady_Alustriel> I didn't catch that Mass Effect stream and I really wish I did
[4:43:23] <DracaenaLeaf> nah
[4:43:26] <%AncelDeLambert> that was a bad day
[4:43:34] <captainthunderwolf> Mass Effect: Andromeda is a hard 6/10 and that's so much worse than a full and proper trashfire.
[4:43:35] <Logan_Jennings1> Guess that proves Mass Effect Andromida FUCKIN SUCKS
[4:43:37] <Angry_Ev1L> my anger about how mediocre this game is was entertaining LUL
[4:43:39] <captainthunderwolf> Fuck what they did to Mass Effect.
[4:43:40] <%Kataguro> Go watch the VOD of Andromeda for like 15 minutes and then stop because woof
[4:43:40] <$wolfofsound> Did they even play the game yet? I was watching the pokemon stream
[4:43:41] <ebonifragaria> Damn I was just wondering if you ever played Mass Effect
[4:43:43] <$i_am_therydon> pillars was good damnit
[4:43:45] <Bouldus> Pillars was fun
[4:43:46] <%happyface699> @captainthunderwolf they could’ve picked on ghost rider 2 but no
[4:43:48] <%legendfather_of_giants> what they DID
[4:43:58] <captainthunderwolf> To ZHENG-HU
[4:44:01] <Bouldus> i enjoyed the Pillars streams
[4:44:01] <%Kataguro> @wolfofsound Just wrapping up. They did the big riot
[4:44:15] <Everpresent_Overseer> Drink all the grapefruit. Got it
[4:44:18] <crimsonharvest> Can I get super high if I vape weed and drink grapefruit?
[4:44:20] <DavidSanChan> grapefruit + viagra
[4:44:21] <+Gravity_Gunner> Andromeda and BioWare can go fuck themselves until they stop being man hating scumbags.
[4:44:25] <%spacekataz18> Grapefruits are shit fruit boo grapefruit
[4:44:26] <captainthunderwolf> I also really liked the Pillars streams, but I really liked Pillars as well.
[4:44:27] <$wolfofsound> @Kataguro LUL guess I'll do the VOD tomorrow
[4:44:38] <captainthunderwolf> For the record, chat, if you like RPGs, Pillars 2 is good.
[4:44:39] <%ssjklyco> That may explain a lot of paige
[4:44:45] <b1gboss007> Deja vu

[4:47:59] <$TheSniperJoe> pogchamp1000 If you think about it...Thanksgiving is kinda Papa Nurgle's holiday. It's all about sitting around, eating, and letting yourself slowly rot away in the warm comfort of your family/food coma. That's oddly comforting to me for some reason.
[4:48:01] <$wolfofsound> Cus cleaning shit is pretty bad
[4:48:05] <%jiin6> Time isn't a thing in pokemon

[4:48:42] <Bouldus> smegma virus?
[4:48:45] <OkamiDude15> to the moon gave me the big cries
