[0:11:56] <$NitronStreams> I was there
[0:11:57] <%Gouf_Troop> Gouf_Troop subscribed with Prime. They've subscribed for 18 months! Have you seen Phantom of the Paradise. Its a fun campy 70s musical that is like a mix of Phantom of the Opera and Rocky Horror, and its a joy.
[0:12:07] <$NitronStreams> I saw everything
[0:12:07] <%Bluwizard21> @PeachSaliva Get drunk again, it helps. But after this time get some water and some pickle juice or a gatorade

[0:13:05] <levimonstapaws> Weren’t you drinking when you saw Space Jam 2? Lol
[0:13:22] <%Captainahab_37> hey everyone how's it going
[0:13:26] <LeafarOz> KEKW
[0:13:28] <rizintaco> That movie was garbitch
[0:13:29] <cache_22> Who watches Space Jam 2 sober?
[0:13:36] <%DooWopShaBop> Space Jam 2 was not a good movie but it was fun
[0:13:55] <levimonstapaws> Paige, you’re still my foxy hero! <3
[0:14:05] <BluffRainbow> Hi @captainahab_37 I’m good how’s you

[0:14:22] <%Captainahab_37> I'm good, discovered I might want a jumping spider
[0:14:25] <+amomentarygenius> I regret watching space jam 2 sober. my kids barely liked it.
[0:14:26] <%hewlettfan96> 18 months sounds like a pain
[0:14:41] <$Puhff> I played DBD and hated it. I blame you @peachsaliva !
[0:14:51] <mr_saturday93> with your vtuber does that mean we'll never see your old face again?
[0:14:59] <thelonechris> You know it's bad when even the kids are meh
[0:15:02] <+Ynkubus_> awful
[0:15:16] <Megaleg> yeah thats because no kid has seen mad max and the matrix
[0:15:17] <%Captainahab_37> Shut Up and Jam film is needed I will die on this hill
[0:15:18] <+Ches_Neckbeard> Space Jam 1 is all the rose colored glasses and 2 is made for kids that don't exist
[0:15:25] <Monkeyweed21> its like going to watch Emoji movie to see how bad it is and not a single child in the theater laughs once
[0:15:33] <%Ranryu692> I loved Space Jam 2, but I also live on NBA Twitter, soooo lol

[0:16:09] <%AncelDeLambert> I am watching NOTHING involving Space Jam in any manner, I value my sanityp
[0:16:19] <%Garthunox> Garthunox subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 12 months! Instead of using bond, might i recommend using Empathy? It'll do the same thing as bond but show you injured auras from across the map
[0:16:19] <M4eta> just got here. Who?
[0:16:32] <eyeobject> The PPP space jam 2 reviews were very informative
[0:16:34] <Zeif00> she's got some cool outfits

[0:16:37] <daftskye> the boots with the FUR?
[0:16:44] <rizintaco> Tuques are rad
[0:16:47] <%Captainahab_37> tactical fashion
[0:16:47] <%hewlettfan96> Space jam is a pain
[0:16:47] <%firewhiskeys> every time i watch you play this i'm so tempted to get into it, even though it's not my typical kind of game
[0:16:48] <%Ranryu692> also dat booty

[0:17:08] <@PlagueOfGripes> I rang
[0:17:14] <+brigiethebaguette> blue seems to be the best for hiding
[0:17:14] <$RC_S3kshun8> I mean Space Jam 1 is definitely worth watching for nostalgia tbh
[0:17:24] <$RC_S3kshun8> I'm not even concerned with 2.
[0:17:38] <spongeofmystery> Huge fan of Kate's leather outfit with that hat. Also the pants make her ass like 20% better
[0:17:41] <%Captainahab_37> y'know what's a boring kids movie is Babe about that pig and the spider
[0:17:44] <+fetrigon> empathy sucks no empathy PunOko
[0:17:54] <%Garthunox> @Captainahab_37 thats not Babe
[0:17:57] <+RealThiele> that superpower: Empathy!
[0:17:59] <+amomentarygenius> Nothing wrong with a Canadian tuxedo.

[0:30:51] <+polothegreatest> dat clown is too aggro WutFace
[0:31:06] <%Captainahab_37> but the clown is loving it he's just yuckin it up
[0:31:17] <$TheNewZealandStory> @QueequegTheater i have no idea what you mean by "can be good with moderate skill". it's clown, you aren't going to get much use out of any loop, so you may as well just drop the pallet and run away while he's breaking it
[0:31:25] <MyNameIsRasus> paige vtuber smile is cute
[0:31:34] <$Sphincter_Spelunker> hey alright
[0:31:37] <mr_saturday93> the uhs are really unsatisfying
[0:31:51] <$Puhff> cookin with ass
[0:31:58] <KaiserMario> Hey this may be a silly question, but does DBD have a vampire, Dracula inspired monster?
[0:32:00] <+QueequegTheater> @TheNewZealandStory You don't need M2 to be a decent killer with anyone except Nurse because she's too slow. You can ignore M2 and still do well
[0:32:07] <@SoFarFetched> @KaiserMario it doesnt
[0:32:13] <KaiserMario> huh
[0:32:21] <$TheNewZealandStory> @QueequegTheater but what does that have to do with anything
[0:32:25] <%athuramn> whoa, pats a survivor? what madness oo
[0:32:27] <@Jekado> yeah no vampire or werewolf type killer... YET
[0:32:29] <+QueequegTheater> @TheNewZealandStory Don't waste pallets
[0:32:42] <Gehtingsberg> chaos legion? Kappa
[0:32:43] <DuoScratch> Oni is the closest, he sucks up blood at least.
[0:32:44] <butthurtdave> are vampires cannibals
[0:32:51] <+lynlyn_ow> no
[0:32:52] <%Captainahab_37> Just have a killer that's a shark
[0:32:55] <$TheNewZealandStory> @QueequegTheater these two statements you're making arent connected at all
[0:32:56] <thelonechris> Isn't Legion just some dude/dudette with a knife?
[0:32:57] <KaiserMario> It would be cool to have a monster that can turn into bats, wolfs and fog
[0:33:00] <%Psych_man13_13> I've said it before, but the new UI showing what character is who and how many hooks they've had is great
[0:33:01] <Dopopo> We need La Magra
[0:33:04] <%Captainahab_37> not even a humanoid shark, just a legitimate accurate shark
[0:33:09] <@Jekado> Wouldn't... Oni be the most "vampire" because he sucks up blood?
[0:33:12] <+RealThiele> near a tree LUL
[0:33:16] <@SoFarFetched> yeah he sucks bubble blood
[0:33:19] <@SoFarFetched> geefSmugAF
[0:33:19] <+fetrigon> i don't believe vampires are cannabis
[0:33:20] <+lynlyn_ow> oh good point
[0:33:21] <DuoScratch> das what I say Jek
[0:33:25] <inorwise> : o
[0:33:30] <rizintaco> Wonder how many times the survivors died before they figured out the gen stuff.
[0:33:34] <%Captainahab_37> I think some vampires were cannibals depending on the media
[0:33:36] <+QueequegTheater> Good throw
[0:33:39] <%Captainahab_37> or I'm crazy
[0:33:42] <%thotbane> @PeachSaliva Paige Legion are Canadian not vampires
[0:34:06] <%VexicBayn> Legion is just the meth goths from.letterkenny
[0:34:08] <+QueequegTheater> Oni is much closer than Legion
[0:34:15] <MyNameIsRasus> i mean we all know vlad the impaler was canadian
[0:34:15] <+parzano> @PeachSaliva why do cows have hooves instead of feet, because they Lactose
[0:34:20] <+Chaos_Aether> canadian vampires what?

[0:35:39] <eyeobject> save orb
[0:35:50] <MyNameIsRasus> this seems like a way too abusable strat
[0:36:00] <+QueequegTheater> Once EGC starts, facecamping is fine, but he should be patrolling the two exits
[0:36:01] <$TheNewZealandStory> can you really blame the killer for camping when all gens are completed
[0:36:07] <+Chaos_Aether> abandon pat save plague
[0:36:18] <+lynlyn_ow> uh oh
[0:36:23] <BumblyMako> You can use perks to prevent campling, but you never know what type of killer you're gonna get

[0:36:47] <%VexicBayn> @mynameisrasus yes and no, it's kind of an honor system so lots of folks simply don't do it but there is usable jank that can result in face camping being a hilarious botch
[0:36:48] <Monkeyweed21> @PatStaresAt should have been on voicechat scrub
[0:36:49] <$TheNewZealandStory> @BumblyMako there are no perks that prevent camping
[0:36:52] <%Garthunox> not much you can do when the clown is acting like a cunt

[0:45:12] <@Jekado> @KaizenChaos about a week or 2
[0:45:19] <$TheNewZealandStory> @inorwise if people just never cleanse, it forces plague to be an m1 killer. legion can at least get around the map quicker and use their power for detection
[0:45:21] <BumblyMako> @KaiserMario recently so she can stream even when she doesn't feel well
[0:45:21] <AtisutoCurry> Pat imma keep it real with you chief, it ain't safe for you right now lmfao

[0:46:15] <%Captainahab_37> what if they grew farm animals on trees?
[0:46:23] <inorwise> @inorwise if no one cleanses thats already better than legion imo, all a decent survivor has to do is spread out when someone gets hit and legion gets like 0 value
[0:46:26] <%Sotetsu> Paige has always been attractive
[0:46:30] <MyNameIsRasus> It's the old lady
[0:46:32] <%Captainahab_37> and instead of herds it was just bushes and trees of farm animals

[1:03:59] <RetroCop87> it was like a Plague Picarto stream for a sec there
[1:04:00] <ElenaManetta> maybe a framerate buffer
[1:04:06] <ElenaManetta> but conversation never stopped or hitched
[1:04:08] <@SoFarFetched> @benjiFG in case they have blood warden which once someone is hooked after its open,it locks you from leaving for a minute or so
[1:04:16] <%Garthunox> @benjiFG there's a perk called Blood Warden that can block the exit if someone is hooked once the gate is open
[1:04:16] <%AncelDeLambert> @benjiFG endgame is timed, you open the door and everyone else has a set time to get out
[1:04:18] <+lynlyn_ow> telll eli about hatch
[1:04:19] <bevyrage> @benjiFG opening the exit puts a timer on the game that you can see at the top of the screen.
[1:04:22] <@Jekado> that 4th should leave has on last hook
[1:04:23] <+fetrigon> LUL

[1:07:28] <+LionKagura> its the power
[1:07:33] <KaiserMario> And her back with it
[1:07:34] <@Jekado> Just retconn that episode in your mind paige
[1:07:36] <%Gouf_Troop> poor murderous worf
[1:07:37] <+thefishofwar> ominous statement sofieWut
[1:07:48] <ergulor> he asked on twitter
[1:07:50] <Laioken13> wht happened to worf
[1:07:53] <$NitronStreams> he twittered
[1:08:01] <+fetrigon> get me one PunOko
[1:08:02] <ElenaManetta> 380 hz??
[1:08:05] <%Kenzo2000> I missed the last dtar trek stream What happened to Worf?
[1:08:09] <UnbearableIsBad> Nice ears
[1:08:17] <+fetrigon> don't be selfish PunOko
[1:08:30] <KaiserMario> Did Pat see that Chris Judge is to voice Black Panther in that squeenix Marvel game?
[1:08:32] <+fetrigon> share the monitor with chat PunOko
[1:08:32] <$NitronStreams> Worf did a bad
[1:08:37] <%ThomasOfTroy> The sword was cursed tho
[1:08:37] <%Gouf_Troop> @Laioken13 he tried to kill someone over a sword
[1:08:47] <%Kenzo2000> Oh the sword episode
[1:08:52] <%JoshManVGH> But it was an insanity virus
[1:08:54] <Laioken13> wtf
[1:08:55] <+Reyvierno> But it was a REALLY COOL hat
[1:08:56] <%Rumbutt> It was bad writing, pretend the episode didn't happen
[1:09:04] <%Rumbutt> it was all a holodream
[1:09:15] <%Kenzo2000> I feel like early DS9 Worf is weird
[1:09:19] <thelonechris> Remember when Worf's spine got shattered by a hollow plastic barrel?
[1:09:21] <%JoshManVGH> Didn't they talk about how it was coated in some sort of viral agent?
[1:09:22] <bevyrage> if the sword doesn't show up again then it might as well not be a canon episode
[1:09:26] <%ThomasOfTroy> It's not *literally* cursed, but it's one of those things that just drives people fucking crazy
[1:09:29] <%rumtumtugnutz> The episode was about human nature.
[1:09:31] <%Gouf_Troop> i pretend picard didnt happen
[1:09:34] <Monkeyweed21> Has Paige gotten to ape daughter yet?
[1:09:45] <%ssjklyco> I rewatched Space Jam 96. The bit with the NBA players trying to get their skills back through various means and Charles Barkley being called a wannabee was the best.
[1:09:47] <%Garthunox> you'll forget about it soon, can you remember your least favorite episodes of previous seasons?
[1:09:48] <%rumtumtugnutz> Absolute power corrupts absolutely.
[1:09:48] <DublinRage> Wharf:sword::Paige:boots
[1:09:58] <bevyrage> @Monkeyweed21 talking about when o'brian's daughter fell into the time portal? we saw that a few months ago
[1:10:08] <@Jekado> The Macguffin of Kahlass
[1:10:09] <markdreizehn> Look, Religion just makes some people crazy and Worf is one of those who go crazy for religion
[1:10:15] <Monkeyweed21> @bevyrage aww damn i missed it
[1:10:17] <DublinRage> *Worf
[1:10:26] <%rumtumtugnutz> Woeful in DS9 really isn’t the best Worf.
[1:10:38] <alex_streams_a_thing> Kur is a figurehead only, like Queen Elizabeth I guess.
[1:10:39] <bevyrage> yeah we're in DS9 now
[1:10:52] <+thefishofwar> strategically pinged the map with the gen to get the killer off pat sofieNotes sofieNotes
[1:10:55] <KaiserMario> Worf's spine being shattered by that empty plastic barrel is still funny to me
[1:11:17] <bevyrage> damn peach these are some on point skell checks
[1:11:19] <alex_streams_a_thing> "Let them eat Gach!"
[1:11:35] <+LionKagura> Honk!
[1:11:46] <%BardicFalanx> BardicFalanx subscribed at Tier 1. 
[1:11:54] <%Garthunox> this trapper has no corrupt, no ruin, he's lost this
[1:12:03] <inorwise> worf would be a good killer to put in this game
[1:12:09] <albret__einstrong> Isn't cooridinating over Discord in DBD basically just cheating?
[1:12:13] <%Garthunox> I've done that
[1:12:24] <%Rumbutt> yes
[1:12:25] <KaiserMario> Man, I dunno how I feel about this cheating using the chat, poor killer...
[1:12:26] <@Jekado> @inorwise THIS TUNNEL HAS NO HONOR. Also you can turn all the pallets into barrels
[1:12:26] <neroforte177> o u t p l a y e d
[1:12:28] <%TheLakinessMonster> Everyone does it. It's expected.
[1:12:32] <+Jonny_Worldbeater> Hello stream!
[1:12:35] <MyNameIsRasus> sounds like pat stepped on a trap
[1:12:36] <%JoshManVGH> Oh, the thing I read was about the writers saying they DIDN'T WANT there to be a mystical or chemical reason the sword made them go nuts.
[1:12:55] <+polothegreatest> oh no pat
[1:12:56] <+lynlyn_ow> LUL
[1:13:05] <%JoshManVGH> i guess I just altered that memory to "nah space chemisty"
[1:13:12] <MyNameIsRasus> it's established she is legally blind
[1:13:21] <inorwise> @inorwise if a survivor drops a pallet on his back it stuns him twice as long
[1:13:28] <%Garthunox> no thanat either
[1:13:39] <%Garthunox> no noed
[1:13:41] <CrimsonFox777> Are we still not letting it go that Paige guessed her glasses' prescription?
[1:13:58] <+Chaos_Aether> so Whens the next eye doctors visit?
[1:14:10] <DrkJP520> is there even a killer?
[1:14:21] <MyNameIsRasus> autoboys roll out
[1:14:21] <albret__einstrong> Man, this is basically just cheating. Voice chat gives you so much power the game was never balanced for.
[1:14:22] <+polothegreatest> hes dead :(
[1:15:33] <+fetrigon> cheaters PunOko
[1:15:45] <+fetrigon> cheatin PunOko
[1:16:03] <MyNameIsRasus> what a hero
[1:16:15] <+polothegreatest> LUL
[1:16:28] <@Jekado> Eli with the sandbag
[1:16:35] <bevyrage> wait you can get blinded by your own flashlight?
[1:16:39] <@Jekado> no
[1:16:40] <bevyrage> oh it was CROSS FIRE
[1:16:40] <%Garthunox> @fetrigon who?
[1:16:41] <+lynlyn_ow> KOBE
[1:16:46] <$NitronStreams> This is why you never play the hero
[1:16:47] <@Jekado> it was plagues flashbang
[1:16:49] <+lynlyn_ow> awww
[1:17:17] <MyNameIsRasus> oh lawd he comin
[1:17:25] <%JoshManVGH> "With my dying breath, I cure Eli!" Paige, 2021
[1:17:26] <+lynlyn_ow> wait wht
[1:17:31] <+lynlyn_ow> what is claud doing
[1:17:36] <%JoshManVGH> curse
[1:17:38] <+fetrigon> @garthunox oh I was just jokin about them using voice chat
[1:17:42] <@Jekado> she probably found hatch but peach stayed alive
[1:17:46] <inorwise> the eurobeat remix of that song is so good
[1:17:49] <+lynlyn_ow> ohhh
[1:17:51] <+fetrigon> I don't really care LUL
[1:17:52] <+polothegreatest> she wasnt larger than life
[1:17:52] <%Garthunox> @fetrigon how is that remotely cheating?
[1:17:58] <@Jekado> hatch doesn't stay open if peach tries to stay alive
[1:18:04] <thedankestmeeme> I need a hero through the end of the night!
[1:18:13] <%alternative_flu> but she wasn't off the hook that last round
[1:18:15] <%alternative_flu> buh dum tish
[1:18:18] <%Garthunox> ironic cos she was on the hook that game
[1:18:45] <mike2hands> PWAGUE OF GWIPES AND PWAT STAWES AT
[1:18:49] <thedankestmeeme> he's gotta be big and he's gotta be strong and he's gotta be fresh from a fight
[1:18:49] <mr_saturday93> baby talk
[1:18:50] <mike2hands> owo
[1:19:00] <thedankestmeeme> I NEED A HERO
[1:19:09] <mr_saturday93> so she thinks like a baby which explains a lot
[1:19:13] <albret__einstrong> @fetrigon Voice chat IS cheating, DBD was never balanced for survivors to be able to communitcate in detail.
[1:19:15] <MyNameIsRasus> I'M HOLDING OUT FOR A HERO 'TIL THE END OF THE NIGHT
[1:19:16] <%alternative_flu> I do
[1:19:17] <eyeobject> PogChamp dog kisses
[1:19:23] <albret__einstrong> It's why the feature was never added to the game.
[1:19:31] <%Garthunox> i am pretty sweet

[1:22:19] <+Deft_Thought> I've had some good white sauce pizza with thin sliced lemon
[1:22:20] <%JoshManVGH> You don't like cheese, with your cheese? WTF
[1:22:22] <ltbabylucien> Yes anchovies and hand-tossed sauce. But I'm allergic to tomatoes, so I get garlic sauce.
[1:22:23] <%alternative_flu> what if white sauce with anchovies
[1:22:28] <+polothegreatest> just peperonni
[1:22:29] <$Sphincter_Spelunker> White sauce doesn't taste good cold. My only complaint
[1:22:29] <MyNameIsRasus> chicken with catupiry pizza is the truest pizza as a brazillian
[1:22:31] <%AncelDeLambert> I have a pizza place near me that does a chicken and jalapeno white sauce pizza and it's fantastic
[1:22:33] <ltbabylucien> *hand--tossed crust
[1:22:35] <%VexicBayn> white sauce, artichokes. chicken, spinch

[1:22:44] <%rumtumtugnutz> White sauce and mushrooms is best pizza
[1:22:49] <%TheLakinessMonster> But how is the crust on the pizza? Detroit style is my favorite.
[1:22:51] <GuyverTypeL> Funny because a pizza slice is almost a triangle and pat loves that shape
[1:22:51] <%maenos2> Patrick commandee
[1:22:54] <GuilKato> what about Pesto sauce paige?
[1:22:55] <$Sphincter_Spelunker> I saw a place that does "pink sauce" I have no clue what it is
[1:22:59] <%AncelDeLambert> marinara is best, but there's good white sauce choices
[1:22:59] <BoxNavy> :(
[1:23:00] <islandsunn> white sauce you say
[1:23:11] <ltbabylucien> @Sphincter_Spelunker "Pink sauce" is mixed red sauce and white
[1:23:12] <%VexicBayn> @sphincter_spelunker pink sauce is tubby custard
[1:23:18] <%JoshManVGH> Pepperoni, meatball, garlic NY style pizza is GOD tier!
[1:23:19] <+polothegreatest> gotta order those anchovies ones, never taste them
[1:23:25] <%ThomasOfTroy> Chicago deepdish is disgusting, it's just thick bread drowned in sauce

[1:23:42] <churropoppa> @BoxNavy sounds like vodka sauce
[1:23:43] <%alternative_flu> i like pizzas of all kinds
[1:23:45] <+polothegreatest> pink sauce is just mayo+ketchup
[1:23:51] <%alternative_flu> at least I think I do
[1:23:54] <$Sphincter_Spelunker> @ltbabylucien well, that seems pointless

[1:24:45] <%patriotrenegade> Thin crust and eapolitan sucks shit tho
[1:24:46] <ltbabylucien> @Sphincter_Spelunker Some people like both in a dish! My dad likes half-red half-white sauce for his cannoli.
[1:24:47] <freelancebabymaker> detroit style is better than chicago style
[1:24:47] <+Deft_Thought> Lasagna is a casserole too
[1:24:48] <%ThomasOfTroy> @JoshManVGH It's RIDICULOUSLY greasy

[1:27:55] <BoxNavy> ok cool
[1:27:58] <bevyrage> the weird buffering might be from the replay buffer caching out and then starting up again, because streamlabs OBS had an update that did that to me earlier
[1:27:58] <+LensWander> Is the anniversary event still on?
[1:28:04] <%ThomasOfTroy> But not with the audio for some reason
[1:28:13] <$Sphincter_Spelunker> Paige is the reason why drug commercials say "Do not take -product name- if you are allergic to -product name-"
[1:28:22] <BoxNavy> audios fine

[1:29:03] <%Deadpal> Not a universal issue

[1:29:06] <bevyrage> coincidentally, gouda cheese is used for white sauce. it's not used for alfredo sauce

[1:30:23] <$NitronStreams> bad times were had
[1:30:39] <freelancebabymaker> the only thing i think the friday the 13th game may have over dbd is ways to keep the killer player off of you
[1:31:14] <+CapOfAllFools> @freelancebabymaker I also like the built-in vocal communications, like having radios, or proximity chat.
[1:31:15] <+doc_ock_rokc> @PeachSaliva Legion's frenzy stab makes it so he/she can see you if he stabs another person but can't put you into Dying if he does
[1:31:25] <President_Pariah> i'm fairly new to DBD, what survivor/killer learnable perks do you beeline?
[1:31:39] <OasisDealer> a cool hint for this map is that if a room has a blinking sign above it, there's a gen in there
[1:31:53] <+doc_ock_rokc> @President_Pariah For killer BBQ and Chilli
[1:31:56] <%Garthunox> @President_Pariah Bill and Laurie for Borrowed Time and Decisive Strike
[1:32:01] <freelancebabymaker> @CapOfAllFools i mean the friday game also has like more varied ways for games to go and also jason is there
[1:32:12] <BaronVonProlix> i thought those rat noises was pat giggling
[1:32:21] <BoxNavy> me too lol
[1:32:32] <BoxNavy> pats a little rat man
[1:32:37] <freelancebabymaker> @CapOfAllFools like now that im thinking about it yknow
[1:32:37] <BaronVonProlix> it is a known fact
[1:32:44] <Zeif00> Borrowed Time from Bill is debatedly the best surivor perk in the game atm
[1:33:01] <+MackFighters> some of the meta ones for Killer: Barbecue and Chili, Corrupt intervention, Undying, Ruin
[1:33:02] <+doc_ock_rokc> @President_Pariah Get Leatherface go for BBQ and you get knock out and Franklin's Demise along the way
[1:33:13] <+lynlyn_ow> you guys need to do one more gen for it to spawn
[1:33:16] <%Garthunox> @Zeif00 No debate, its so clutch
[1:33:19] <+sinderb1ock> Repaired gens = remaining survivors + 1

[1:38:46] <%Garthunox> no one except for Ash Williams says anything
[1:38:51] <@Jekado> @doc_ock_rokc You mean back 4 blood? psaSmug
[1:38:54] <+doc_ock_rokc> No this game to be Multi cultural doesn't have voice lines just screams and grunts
[1:39:05] <%thotbane> @doc_ock_rokc Hey they made Alyx. Which....I gues I'll play someday maybe? And Artifact
[1:39:07] <@MelBrooksKA> @thotbane only Tuesday and Wednesday for me, I wanted to have my WFH on the beginning and end of the week and every other week I have Friday off, so Thursday is technically my end of week then
[1:39:07] <+MackFighters> Bill has no voice lines
[1:39:12] <solracc25> Wouldn't an RE Village map be great?
[1:39:24] <@Jekado> Techincally Trickster has voice lines
[1:39:33] <@Jekado> since he speaks korean and whatnot
[1:39:33] <@SoFarFetched> Yeah the only one with voicelines is Ash from EVil who talks everytime you select him geefPlz
[1:39:35] <thedankestmeeme> he needs to say pills here where am I gonna find them
[1:39:37] <+MackFighters> Trickster is the only killer with voice lines
[1:39:43] <Persona_EX> A piece of my fucking tooth just came out
[1:39:45] <@SoFarFetched> at least on survivor side
[1:39:45] <%thotbane> Nostromo?
[1:39:46] <+doc_ock_rokc> Concidering that one of the items is literally a nother browed times
[1:39:50] <Persona_EX> Fuck
[1:39:51] <BigFingerRo> Oh that'd be sick
[1:39:53] <%half_awake1> that would be the best
[1:39:55] <%ThomasOfTroy> @Persona_EX You should go see a dentist
[1:39:57] <ElenaManetta> is the shining hotel in the game yet
[1:39:59] <+Scevda> Hmmm XCOM crossover?
[1:40:05] <@Jekado> Stupid sexy korean majima/joker...
[1:40:06] <SpaceGuntank> my first thought went to Among Us..
[1:40:07] <blue6sub6remnant6> You know, there's a youtube video where someone did a mock up of a xenomortph in DBD. Somewhere out there.
[1:40:09] <+lynlyn_ow> Hawkins
[1:40:09] <BigFingerRo> But Plague, this sounds like it's a Star Trek episode
[1:40:13] <Luizabd> the stranger things map
[1:40:13] <%Garthunox> oh, Hawkins
[1:40:14] <CrimsonFox777> @Persona_EX Your options are a dentist or the Tooth Fairy. Choose wisely.
[1:40:23] <+Dova573> That looks like DBD brander 5 gum
[1:40:28] <islandsunn> Predator would be a good one
[1:40:29] <Persona_EX> Just tie a string to it and slam the door
[1:40:32] <+Dova573> branded;
[1:40:45] <%ShockzNDrawe> Dead Rising in DbD
[1:40:46] <%patriotrenegade> I want the robots from CHOPPING MALL
[1:40:47] <@Jekado> YEAHHHH
[1:40:48] <+lynlyn_ow> EZ Clap
[1:40:49] <+MooseIsGoose> a mall would be cool
[1:40:49] <%JoshManVGH> Thwap thwap thwap
[1:40:49] <@Jekado> YOU DID IT
[1:40:53] <CrimsonFox777> Children of the Corn chapter when?
[1:40:56] <eyeobject> PogChamp
[1:40:58] <+doc_ock_rokc> COWARDS
[1:41:01] <blue6sub6remnant6> GG EZ NO RE i guess.
[1:41:04] <@Jekado> Its so bad for most killers
[1:41:06] <laserbeaming> more Khorne you say?
[1:41:07] <mr_saturday93> I like that map
[1:41:08] <+doc_ock_rokc> What fucking cowards
[1:41:18] <%AncelDeLambert> hence why even when I played this game, I never used cake
[1:41:19] <radda343> people hate it but if you played re2 at all it's not tht bad
[1:41:19] <+doc_ock_rokc> I play maps i'm shit at all the time
[1:41:19] <%Garthunox> chucky wont be a killer, he's way too small, victor is small enough and he had to be paired with charlotte
[1:41:27] <@Jekado> Its a shame RPD is really well done
[1:41:30] <Mr_JustinJones> Plague don't have that cake
[1:41:38] <BigFingerRo> YO GUYS
[1:41:43] <President_Pariah> Candyman when?
[1:41:47] <BigFingerRo> PINHEAD IN THIS GAME
[1:41:51] <Decarcassor> The RPD map is faithfull yes, but terrible for the purpose of DBD gameplay.
[1:41:51] <%Kenzo2000> wait, instead of taking the broken map out of rotation they just auto end the match?
[1:41:53] <blue6sub6remnant6> BIG Chuckus.
[1:41:54] <$Chatterbox1991> What about Beetleguise as a killer? @PeachSaliva
[1:41:56] <+MackFighters> Chucky would be able to run under pallets LUL
[1:41:56] <+doc_ock_rokc> Pinhead would work
[1:41:59] <%patriotrenegade> no
[1:42:00] <+MooseIsGoose> they would make him bigger I think
[1:42:00] <Profmcstevie> Put him on stilts, even more terrifying
[1:42:01] <+doc_ock_rokc> tons of screaming
[1:42:02] <Zebroneath> I'd like Scissorman from Clock Tower
[1:42:05] <@Jekado> Chucky on a trike
[1:42:05] <ElenaManetta> chuckie and chuckie's wife on his shoulders
[1:42:05] <kyeeooverlord> How about a Chucky Tiffany combo?
[1:42:07] <+goose_attack_almanac> At that point you might as well make Pumpkin head
[1:42:12] <islandsunn> Give him a lil go cart
[1:42:14] <+RealThiele> 2 chuckies in a trenchcoat
[1:42:17] <@Jekado> or Chucky would be able to wall hax at short distance
[1:42:17] <%Treuan> Cheer500 Good to see you!
[1:42:19] <thedankestmeeme> smAll with big lunge?
[1:42:23] <Monkeyweed21> Just have him stand on a barrel like Navirou
[1:42:24] <radda343> I just want Lady D and Ethan as a survivor with all his head options having no face
[1:42:24] <SpaceGuntank> ooh ooh what if the Survivors are tiny too!
[1:42:34] <eyeobject> Eli in DBD. Just Eli.
[1:42:36] <+RaziWraith> Chuckie and that female one from the one movie in a trenchcoat LUL
[1:42:41] <+doc_ock_rokc> @PeachSaliva At that rate we should just ad the leprechaun or the gremlins
[1:42:42] <%JoshManVGH> What if they just make Chucky his adult Brad Dourfi form.
[1:42:50] <$Chatterbox1991> You could have it be Chucky and the Bride as a duel character; one uses a gun to flush people out while chucky circles around for the kill
[1:42:53] <ElenaManetta> your survivors are turned into kid-versions if someone is playing chucky
[1:42:53] <CrimsonFox777> @eyeobject He'd be the scariest killer, I'll give you that.
[1:42:56] <+RealThiele> Leprechaun in the hood
[1:42:57] <BigFingerRo> @eyeobject ANd he says wawrschclawth when he gets you?
[1:43:05] <%Garthunox> next killer will be original, im betting it now
[1:43:05] <StarlitStunner> Werewolf in London
[1:43:06] <+MooseIsGoose> or they make a special map that only he can be played on
[1:43:07] <hairtoday> let's see the disco elysium detective as a survivor
[1:43:08] <blue6sub6remnant6> @RealThiele I want to believe.
[1:43:11] <laserbeaming> OwO
[1:43:12] <+RealThiele> LUL
[1:43:13] <%JoshManVGH> Just some theif jackass who knows a voodoo spell
[1:43:15] <FirewallStorm> yes pls
[1:43:17] <kyeeooverlord> @raziwrath Tiffany?
[1:43:17] <Gehtingsberg> How terrifying
[1:43:17] <+MackFighters> they need to add a Xenomorph and have a Nostromo map
[1:43:20] <biglomix> the howling
[1:43:23] <+biaxia> seriously, push candyman! such an underrated classic!
[1:43:24] <$TheNewZealandStory> i want bela lugosi style dracula in dbd
[1:43:24] <President_Pariah> they could put in a Fear Street character if they're still on good terms with Netflix
[1:43:28] <laserbeaming> 16 Werewolves
[1:43:29] <thedankestmeeme> what if they made van helsing?
[1:43:34] <HaroldDonchee> just make it a dude in a fursuit
[1:43:37] <+CapOfAllFools> You gotta find Wolfsbane around the map, like the vaccine for the T-Virus
[1:43:40] <%ospreyworks> the shape shifted from the thing would be cool
[1:43:42] <+doc_ock_rokc> @PeachSaliva The Thing, Disguise as a survivor you hit
[1:43:43] <+Chaos_Aether> @PeachSaliva have you seen the concept trailer for the Attraction?
[1:43:51] <GuilKato> The Howling!
[1:43:54] <BigFingerRo> @doc_ock_rokc OH THAT SOUNDS BUSTED
[1:43:55] <%waltzqueen> what if werewolf but once you die on the hook you get to hunt team mates. to keep you playing even though you died
[1:43:57] <+RealThiele> disguising as a survivor would be super OP
[1:43:57] <ElenaManetta> i figured it would be like An American Werewolf in London where you get hallucinations if bitten
[1:44:03] <OasisDealer> give me a priate killer with a beach or port as a map
[1:44:07] <%ShockzNDrawe> amongus
[1:44:14] <kyeeooverlord> S U S
[1:44:15] <+CapOfAllFools> gahdang, a Thing killer would be awesome.
[1:44:17] <@MistyMntns> @PeachSaliva Prestige your characters
[1:44:20] <President_Pariah> Jason Furhees
[1:44:22] <%Garthunox> they tried it with legion though, the accidentally did it with Pig
[1:44:22] <@MistyMntns> With love
[1:44:23] <Visorak6> It would fall apart with voice chat.
[1:44:31] <President_Pariah> it's just Jason but fuzzy AF
[1:44:33] <biglomix> there is a game like that
[1:44:39] <%JoshManVGH> Oh! A survivor and a Killer hybrid! they each have to fight for control, and the model swaps.
[1:44:40] <$Chatterbox1991> The Droogs from Clockwork Orange?
[1:44:44] <+RealThiele> "prestiege"
[1:44:44] <%Garthunox> Prestige isnt worth it
[1:44:46] <+doc_ock_rokc> @doc_ock_rokc How to fix it. Thing can grab but he can't hit unless he transforms
[1:44:47] <DrFacilier> Tim Curry Pennywise killer
[1:44:48] <%Rumbutt> prestige is a scam
[1:44:52] <Decarcassor> The only "monster" killer are licenced ones. All the original killer where regular humans before the Entity intervened. So I wouldn't bet on an originla beast killer (unless its just a guy wearing pelt and howling at the moon). :p
[1:44:53] <+RealThiele> blizzard saying Nuh uh
[1:44:53] <+SaphronBlackbourne> Prestige is very not worth it at all
[1:44:55] <blue6sub6remnant6> @President_Pariah A hocky mask over a furry head? That would be great, but off tone-wise.
[1:44:56] <%skm742> BOY is it a bunch of bs
[1:44:59] <+MooseIsGoose> wha happen
[1:45:00] <mr_saturday93> Oh so PR bullshit
[1:45:01] <%waltzqueen> typical
[1:45:05] <+cvp5127> sure
[1:45:07] <%AncelDeLambert> what's sad is that this probably isn't going to do a thing to the company
[1:45:09] <%skm742> 'never happened, but also we got better guys'
[1:45:09] <+RaziWraith> I
[1:45:10] <mr_saturday93> mhmmm
[1:45:11] <+FiresideInternetCafe> @Garthunox excuse me P3 cheryl is awesome
[1:45:13] <FirewallStorm> for a killer like that you have to make it busted for soloq
[1:45:15] <BaronVonProlix> i belive that 200%
[1:45:17] <biglomix> It's Califorina though
[1:45:19] <mr_saturday93> fuck off blizzard
[1:45:20] <+RaziWraith> I'm out of the loop. What is this about?
[1:45:23] <%JoshManVGH> MORE art of Bobby Kotic as the devil! May the man never date again!
[1:45:24] <DianaTheAscian> The state isn't twitter blizzard
[1:45:28] <%Kenzo2000> we love diversity, can't rape without women
[1:45:28] <eyeobject> We are diverse in how we sexually harass
[1:45:32] <RetroCop87> "now excuse us as we go back to our game of beer pong"
[1:45:33] <%Estuko> @PeachSaliva For Chucky height problem, why not have his girlfriend as a human carry him and swing him as he carries a knife?
[1:45:34] <biglomix> "Dancing in the Rain"
[1:45:35] <+RealThiele> eyeball torture
[1:45:37] <%AncelDeLambert> Activision is big enough to have big friends that'll float the stock and keep the company running
[1:45:39] <Monkeyweed21> add Dan Schneider
[1:45:42] <%Garthunox> @FiresideInternetCafe doesnt make it worth it though
[1:45:43] <+sandrews> Pinhead?!
[1:45:46] <mr_saturday93> @joshmanvgh Activision being cunts to women
[1:45:47] <@MistyMntns> Candyman?
[1:45:47] <%ssjklyco> Pretty sure they are investigating discrimination and harrassment.
[1:45:51] <+MackFighters> so's Legion
[1:45:52] <RetroCop87> like Activision employees
[1:45:56] <Monkeyweed21> what if we get a Smash player as a killer
[1:45:57] <Mr_JustinJones> I mean you play as killers
[1:45:58] <+SharpClaw_> so is this k.pop dude
[1:45:58] <+MooseIsGoose> they could do candyman.
[1:45:58] <+FackinCrazy> GIVE ME PUMPKIN HEAD
[1:46:00] <+Bullet_harrier> Like trickster?
[1:46:04] <+RealThiele> Issac and necromorphs would work in dbd if EA wasnt shit
[1:46:06] <%aishman> What about....THE LEPRECHAUN
[1:46:06] <ElenaManetta> give me someone totally unexpected, like The Creeper from Scooby Doo
[1:46:06] <%Sotetsu> Next killer should be a game dev
[1:46:06] <+Jonny_Worldbeater> Which is business speak for 'We super did it, but plz don't talk about it'
[1:46:08] <%thotbane> they're just Legion but with more fashion sense
[1:46:09] <studleydoorite> it would be like having the crips or bloods in the game
[1:46:10] <+tigerfang86> they're "just" rapist drug addicts, which is not very great
[1:46:12] <+biaxia> aren't they like a bunch of teenagers?
[1:46:13] <blue6sub6remnant6> "The Droogs" So like the K-Pop stan, but not Korean?
[1:46:18] <%JoshManVGH> Ew
[1:46:19] <%thotbane> Legion never raped anyone
[1:46:22] <+tigerfang86> yeah.....
[1:46:28] <%ospreyworks> pinhead, but he comes after you for solving rescinded generators
[1:46:28] <Dunmarkh> LUL
[1:46:28] <%rumtumtugnutz> Drink milk
[1:46:32] <+doc_ock_rokc> DRUID WOULD BE COOL
[1:46:33] <HaroldDonchee> the voicelines would be fun for droogs but can't think of much else cool
[1:46:34] <+tigerfang86> the mystery of the droogids
[1:46:35] <VirtuaRailith> Mystery of the Druids
[1:46:35] <%ospreyworks> reskinned
[1:46:37] <FirewallStorm> what I want is a classic gothic horror one
[1:46:39] <+razielhex> BIGFOOT
[1:46:42] <+RealThiele> smoke much weed and summon a hot dryad
[1:46:45] <+SharpClaw_> droods
[1:46:48] <@Jekado> Still bummed RPD doesn't have a slide puzzle to open the gate.
[1:46:50] <$Chatterbox1991> a Veloceraptor from Jurrassic Park
[1:46:51] <+razielhex> BIG ASS SASQUATCH
[1:46:52] <+MackFighters> What about Jack Torrance from the Shining with the Overlook hotel as a map? @PeachSaliva
[1:46:53] <blue6sub6remnant6> Droods from Mystery of the Droods. DO IT.
[1:46:56] <Laecerelius> Oh shit, Lannigan! He wants his scissors!
[1:46:57] <ConflagrationsGaming> veloCIRAPTOR!!!!
[1:46:58] <+FackinCrazy> what about a regular bear
[1:47:09] <+FiresideInternetCafe> Love Pat and Eli playing survivor with you btw. It adds an awesome dynamic
[1:47:09] <anAngryHamster> Mystery of the Druids belongs in the horror hall of fame
[1:47:09] <%thotbane> My idea: A Gorilla. just a normal gorilla
[1:47:13] <+RealThiele> COCAINE BEAR AS KILLER
[1:47:13] <+Jonny_Worldbeater> Halligan is such a chode
[1:47:23] <+razielhex> NAKED ASS HAIRY WENDIGO YETI MTOHERFUCKER
[1:47:24] <$TheNewZealandStory> ghost face
[1:47:25] <%Kenzo2000> Randy Pitchford as a killer. He can only attack barely legal magicians
[1:47:25] <%VexicBayn> the mystery of the druids video is one ***.favorite bedtime youtubes
[1:47:25] <radda343> it's a shame the Alien franchis has it's own terrible co-op game because an alien in DBD would be hilarious
[1:47:26] <CrimsonFox777> Just bring in a hippo as the killer.
[1:47:27] <+doc_ock_rokc> @PeachSaliva I always wanted an animated scarecrow that has multiple bodies you could jump too
[1:47:29] <Gehtingsberg> Yo imagine a Jurassic park stage/killer
[1:47:30] <%JoshManVGH> What about a killer who could posses survivors?
[1:47:34] <eyeobject> Can my fear of intimacy be a killer?
[1:47:35] <FirewallStorm> Halligan as a killer when
[1:47:36] <+RaziWraith> RPD gang should have perks that change timed activations like generators into puzzles LUL
[1:47:50] <happychaosvalentine> An SCP character would be nice
[1:47:53] <%Ranryu692> did Pat just say he doesn't see Suge Knight?
[1:47:53] <$TheNewZealandStory> @JoshManVGH does the possessed survivor just not get to play
[1:48:01] <ConflagrationsGaming> idk how they would even DO an scp character
[1:48:04] <+doc_ock_rokc> Can't get a scp
[1:48:05] <ConflagrationsGaming> like... as far as rights
[1:48:08] <+sandrews> Have they done like a vampire? Like just a strain up vampire?
[1:48:09] <islandsunn> lol
[1:48:12] <+sandrews> straight*
[1:48:15] <%Treuan> Slendy would be rad
[1:48:20] <@SoFarFetched> no vampires
[1:48:22] <$Chatterbox1991> Reagan from The Exorcist? @PeachSaliva
[1:48:30] <+doc_ock_rokc> @PeachSaliva The Looksee already exists as a costume for Doctor
[1:48:30] <$Chatterbox1991> you could possess people
[1:48:32] <islandsunn> Dracula is public domain!
[1:48:39] <%thotbane> @Chatterbox1991 Its called Pazuzu
[1:48:41] <%Garthunox> They want to depip, maybe
[1:48:42] <%JoshManVGH> @thenewzealandstory They would have to complete a minigame or something to regaine control. Other survivors coukd help exorcise.
[1:48:44] <laserbeaming> that one scp with all the porn
[1:48:44] <@MistyMntns> Slenderman would be great. I need to dig through SCP to find a good one for a killer
[1:48:46] <+doc_ock_rokc> I guess Hag is already a Druid
[1:48:48] <%patriotrenegade> Jay Gatsby, he's public domain!
[1:48:51] <+TopsyCretes> he might be being nice
[1:48:52] <%Garthunox> its wraith
[1:48:54] <FirewallStorm> you know what that phone scp would be really interesting
[1:48:55] <@MistyMntns> Maybe the Plague Doctor SCP
[1:48:58] <+RealThiele> Green light special
[1:48:58] <ConflagrationsGaming> could it be ghost face maybe?
[1:49:01] <$TheNewZealandStory> @JoshManVGH that unfortunately just sounds very annoying
[1:49:03] <+sandrews> Maybe Wilhem Defoe from the movie where he played Nosferatu
[1:49:09] <$TheNewZealandStory> the killer is an afk wraith btw
[1:49:12] <vastoar> its a wraith, you could hear the breathing
[1:49:14] <+MackFighters> it's definitely a wraith with a NOED game
[1:49:21] <skinsmckenzie> That lag is just DBD being DBD
[1:49:25] <+RealThiele> im gonna *BOOOP*
[1:49:26] <studleydoorite> spoon the door?
[1:49:28] <+doc_ock_rokc> Wrait
[1:49:29] <%VexicBayn> the best SCP killer would be 173 and it would just be too easy to counter
[1:49:30] <$TheNewZealandStory> paige you ran into the killer
[1:49:35] <thepardack> is the stream choppy for anyone else? could just be me.
[1:49:40] <+sinderb1ock> Its a cloaked wraith who is afk
[1:49:40] <radda343> bing bong boi
[1:49:41] <$Chatterbox1991> Arya Stark from GoT as both a killer and a survivor
[1:49:41] <@Jekado> no ed wrath with blood warden
[1:49:42] <islandsunn> also choppy for me
[1:49:42] <%thotbane> @VexicBayn 106
[1:49:42] <+lynlyn_ow> yes stream is laggy for me
[1:49:43] <skinsmckenzie> ppl that want to farm iri shards just afk games as a cloaked wraith
[1:49:45] <+doc_ock_rokc> Killer robot would be nice
[1:49:46] <+RealThiele> stream is big chops here at 480p atm
[1:49:48] <%Garthunox> yeah the stream is stuttering like crazy
[1:49:48] <+sandrews> thinking about it just Willem Defoe. That would be great
[1:49:53] <$NitronStreams> paige tell pat to stop downloading all of the porn
[1:49:59] <+lynlyn_ow> ^
[1:50:01] <+doc_ock_rokc> Ew

[1:50:47] <BoxNavy> 🧍
[1:50:47] <@Jekado> before BS toxic build
[1:50:55] <+shruke> they can't use scp sadly. It's creative commons

[2:01:26] <$Chatterbox1991> antakorous Japanese Old Man with a rifle
[2:01:27] <@Jekado> they should do a Back 4 Blood crossover so they can be next to bill
[2:01:38] <@SoFarFetched> having a killer that can walk through walls would break DbD more than it already does at times
[2:01:43] <+doc_ock_rokc> @shruke nurse already did that

[2:11:58] <+NohbdyIsCrash> you're spoiling us, Paige.
[2:12:04] <@SoFarFetched> I was gonna invite you to a game earlier with Jenna and another friend,but forgot you were streaming
[2:12:08] <%YakumoYomi> I can't believe Farfetched sabotaged the stream.
[2:12:11] <Monkeyweed21> OH NO ACTIVISION BLIZZARD RESPONDED TO THE ALLEGATIONS
[2:12:26] <ChrisJEPlace> :))
[2:12:27] <%JoshManVGH> Does this still have issues on consoles or whatever?
[2:12:29] <@SoFarFetched> shes been getting better with DbD
[2:12:31] <blue6sub6remnant6> @Monkeyweed21 Give me the TL;DR
[2:12:46] <%Bane_Kaikyo> allegations? What'd I miss?
[2:12:53] <radda343> at least this is the least worst indoor map
[2:12:54] <%JoshManVGH> Sounded like hatch
[2:12:54] <@SoFarFetched> and look I have yet to sabotage another persons stream except my own geefPoint
[2:13:00] <%theprofessorerector> @ChrisJEPlace Thanks for the sub! I didn't even notice
[2:13:12] <Monkeyweed21> @blue6sub6remnant6 they're going into denial and acting like California is just out to get them
[2:13:14] <ChrisJEPlace> jakiwaLove
[2:13:18] <$Sphincter_Spelunker> @Bane_Kaikyo toxic work culture, frat bros, sexism, female employee suicide
[2:13:28] <blue6sub6remnant6> Oh my.
[2:13:39] <+brigiethebaguette> nurse is so beautiful
[2:13:41] <Monkeyweed21> @Bane_Kaikyo Activision Blizzard is also run by frat boys and rapists
[2:13:43] <%ShockzNDrawe> fetched is pretty neat
[2:13:43] <%LysdexicAndVolingit> Where is the response they released? it's gotta be awful
[2:13:46] <%Bane_Kaikyo> @Sphincter_Spelunker but who tho? when?
[2:13:47] <+NohbdyIsCrash> oh goodness.
[2:13:56] <%JoshManVGH> @tomoki14_ Thanks for the sub from last night!
[2:13:57] <%skm742> @blue6sub6remnant6 "We didn't do any of that, and somehow also are better now and that was a long time ago."
[2:14:04] <$Sphincter_Spelunker> Activision Blizzard, yeah.
[2:14:12] <Monkeyweed21> @LysdexicAndVolingit they sent a press release to people like Jason Schreier
[2:14:15] <+brigiethebaguette> and a bitch to play as
[2:14:19] <%Bane_Kaikyo> @Monkeyweed21 Oh shit.... Well as fucked up as that is, I'm not surprised this is Activision
[2:14:25] <@Jekado> @ShockzNDrawe you know what else is neat YOUR ART geefPoint
[2:14:34] <blue6sub6remnant6> @skm742 So... peak mixed messaging. Got it.

[2:14:55] <$TheNewZealandStory> paige you make noise while injured
[2:15:05] <%JoshManVGH> Man, why can't corps be condemned due to being hazardous to humanity.
[2:15:08] <Monkeyweed21> @Bane_Kaikyo its also Blizzard one of the lead devs on WoW since vanilla was described as Bill Cosby-like
[2:15:27] <ltbabylucien> hard-working nurse
[2:15:29] <+sandrews> so when wiggling free is it better to just mash as fast as you can or doing a rhythm is better?
[2:15:34] <%Bane_Kaikyo> @Monkeyweed21 Yikes

[2:18:24] <radda343> bill has the funniest knockdown sound
[2:18:30] <mr_saturday93> does Paige add the uhs on purpose?
[2:18:41] <blue6sub6remnant6> I'd like to think so.
[2:18:51] <%hewlettfan96> I think she probably does just that
[2:19:14] <Arancet> dumbassuh*
[2:19:14] <+strakillias> Every Pat-uh is real
[2:19:17] <$TheGreatSkenardo> I'm here- did someone say "dumbass?"

[2:21:41] <+GloweyEyes_Sapphire> i hate that map
[2:21:56] <+brigiethebaguette> I'm Australian so I find that upspeak hate offensive hahaha
[2:22:01] <%ShockzNDrawe> you mean like how you were talking durring the first 10 minutes of your "debut" stream and it was the fakest shit ever and made me want to die
[2:22:02] <+lynlyn_ow> @alternative_flu lol i thought we're doing the office joke lol
[2:22:06] <MonsterGills> Do you sabotage hooks, Paige?
[2:22:10] <+brigiethebaguette> everything is always a question
[2:22:16] <GuyverTypeL> :)
[2:22:25] <%ShockzNDrawe> it's TRUE I apologize
[2:22:26] <+floweri> what the
[2:22:30] <@SoFarFetched> Yeah that was a bit much
[2:22:39] <+sandrews> so like does she have human ears too or are those her only ears?
[2:22:41] <%alternative_flu> @lynlyn_ow jokes on you cuz i've never watched it :T
[2:22:48] <$TheGreatSkenardo> @brigiethebaguette it is?
[2:22:53] <BrianDLahey> youre the realist! forget that negativity
[2:22:59] <+brigiethebaguette> yeah nah it is?
[2:23:11] <+TopsyCretes> Paige is the realest and illest
[2:23:16] <$cade_calrayn> Blabbing is the most genuine thing I know of
[2:23:25] <$cade_calrayn> I blab all the time when I'm nervous
[2:23:26] <@SoFarFetched> Yeah first debut vtuber streams will be nerve wracking.
[2:23:26] <%ShockzNDrawe> I was meaning more that you're very real most of the time, again I'm sorry I insulted you
[2:23:27] <+floweri> oh my gosh no, how is the word fake even associated with you
[2:23:27] <%Gouf_Troop> you cant fake this shit
[2:23:29] <+FoolsArcade> Paige you've always been the LEAST fake
[2:23:32] <+razielhex> witch strong as hell
[2:23:35] <ltbabylucien> oh no
[2:23:36] <$TheGreatSkenardo> kind of looks like survivors are getting styled on
[2:23:37] <+brigiethebaguette> human. she was being human
[2:23:37] <CappuccinoGuil> That was not fake, you were doing your damn best to do something you were enjoying.
[2:23:39] <VirtuaRailith> I remember the first vtube attempt when Paige's model had the lazy eyes
[2:23:42] <%ospreyworks> Peach is one of the realest people on Twitch
[2:23:44] <%EyeFarted> Damn, she clotheslined the fuck out of you
[2:23:44] <+TopsyCretes> emphasis on the illest
[2:23:46] <%JoshManVGH> Oh! the podcast got renamed, its now "Spectacular Vernacular" No-uh! The rise of an exclamitory syllable in English.
[2:23:52] <%ShockzNDrawe> you are though that's why I like you
[2:23:54] <GuyverTypeL> oof
[2:23:54] <+razielhex> virtual
[2:24:00] <@Jekado> Role playing is fun
[2:24:04] <@SoFarFetched> you still did a very good job.
[2:24:13] <+Deft_Thought> The only god is entropy
[2:24:13] <%alternative_flu> can I be hungry?
[2:24:18] <$TheGreatSkenardo> "Can I live?"
[2:24:22] <+polothegreatest> machete to the face
[2:24:23] <islandsunn> Faker? I think you'll find you're the fake hedgehog around here!
[2:24:24] <%ShockzNDrawe> gomen
[2:24:25] <+Deft_Thought> Steadily crawling to the heat death of the universe
[2:24:27] <%optimasmaximas> i think he genuinely thought it was a gag?
[2:24:32] <+Deft_Thought> But you seem all right, Paige
[2:24:37] <$cade_calrayn> even if you feel that way, there's no need to say it to her face, basically
[2:24:38] <$TheGreatSkenardo> Probably not worth thinking about
[2:24:41] <%Estuko> No idea what even prompted such an awful spat towards you, if someone likes you then why even plant poison. Jeez, I had a lot of fun on PAige's debut
[2:24:43] <robotoken> Of course peach is a goddess, she's Red Aqua
[2:24:45] <@Jekado> I can understand RPing is a fun aspect.
[2:24:49] <peachy996> I'll dun
[2:24:57] <%JoshManVGH> Twas the witches curse that raised the nerves in the Fox VVoman!
[2:25:09] <VirtuaRailith> The only gag that happens here is when Paige has to smell gief, elmo, or pat
[2:25:11] <%optimasmaximas> i thought it was fun
[2:25:11] <$TheGreatSkenardo> There was a guided tour of the manor
[2:25:12] <CappuccinoGuil> Your debut was real fun, for sure.
[2:25:13] <+Rofiarf> your debut was very nice
[2:25:18] <+TopsyCretes> you do need some bloody prestige clothes for Kate tho
[2:25:24] <%BardicFalanx> Peach, as someone recently diagnosed with chronic illness thank you very much for being honest, and being yourself. Watching has been a huge help with my mood lately. Especially with a couple of procedures coming tomorrow.
[2:25:25] <%Jack_of_No_Trades> It was fun
[2:25:30] <%Paralurx> Paralurx subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 25 months! Thanks for the shenanigans and amusement Paige, helps me laugh even when life is putting me thru it
[2:25:30] <%ospreyworks> the new vtuber look is a LOOK.
[2:25:34] <@SoFarFetched> Yeah some people got weird with "ew she went vtuber"
[2:25:36] <BrianDLahey> jokes are different than being fake
[2:25:37] <%Kenzo2000> "This anime fox gorl is being too fake"
[2:25:38] <DracaenaLeaf> i just found the dora the explorer talk annoying
[2:25:40] <BrianDLahey> you did great
[2:25:42] <+CapOfAllFools> capofaHyuck capofaHyuck capofaHyuck
[2:25:45] <@SoFarFetched> like who cares dont watch vtuber then geefShrug
[2:25:45] <%Estuko> I invited so many of my friends and we all had fun, the vtuber model was a surprise and super welcome lol I got excited
[2:25:47] <islandsunn> shitting pants on debut stream would have been legendary though
[2:25:50] <%Rumbutt> It had a different energy than your streams have had in the past but definitely not fake
[2:25:50] <$TheGreatSkenardo> Question- how do you clean the fur inside the ears
[2:25:54] <Zakaraz> vtuber culture strikes me as a bandwagon people are jumping on just for attention which might explain the pushback
[2:25:58] <%ospreyworks> it's so cute, and you were genuinely so excited
[2:26:00] <+RealThiele> i was here for the Ara Ara
[2:26:03] <+CapOfAllFools> "I was TRYING not to SHIT my PANTS" - the authenticity we all love capofaHyuck capofaHyuck capofaHyuck
[2:26:06] <CappuccinoGuil> Would you say you were performing? Because that's what it felt, and it's fun to perform.
[2:26:08] <DracaenaLeaf> a lot of people enjoyed it I'm sure
[2:26:13] <+brigiethebaguette> are you used to the mask and the process now?
[2:26:13] <zerointelligence000> I feel like rping comes with the vtuber territory and your personality was still great to see
[2:26:15] <%ThomasOfTroy> ***
[2:26:16] <AKW4RD_BUFF4LO> You're doing great Paige! Appreciate you and Pat
[2:26:17] <DracaenaLeaf> I know :P
[2:26:17] <+RealThiele> i also had a good time
[2:26:18] <peachy996> The Goddess secretly sweating on the inside
[2:26:19] <%Sotetsu> I'm loving your Vtuber streams
[2:26:22] <%Idziman> I thought your debut was really good, it really felt like you were enjoying playing a role
[2:26:22] <%ssjklyco> How dare her avatar have big boobs. So unrealistic.
[2:26:24] <%TheLakinessMonster> The octave that you hit when you yelled "PAAAAAATTTT" during your debut was hilarious to me.
[2:26:26] <%Rumbutt> your vtuber debut was super fun
[2:26:32] <%ShockzNDrawe> see that's kind of what I was trying to say, but I said it like an asshole
[2:26:32] <+SaphronBlackbourne> I could tell you were happy and that was good
[2:26:33] <%ospreyworks> @zakaraz kind of an expensive, labor intensive "bandwagon"
[2:26:33] <%JoshManVGH> The lean into the vtuber persona was unexpected and it was a fun night.
[2:26:34] <@Jekado> I think a lot of people Perform even with family or friends
[2:26:36] <%alternative_flu> I come here cause you always give off good vibes
[2:26:37] <CappuccinoGuil> True, true.
[2:26:40] <islandsunn> All the world's a stage!
[2:26:44] <islandsunn> And we are merely players
[2:26:45] <+RealThiele> the "on" factor
[2:26:49] <+floweri> very true
[2:26:52] <%ospreyworks> people are trying it out because it works for them
[2:26:58] <+GloweyEyes_Sapphire> you are an excellent speaker ^^
[2:26:59] <BackflipCharm> Honestly as long as you had fun.
[2:27:06] <@Jekado> The way one talks at home with their friends is different from family and even that from a work environment.
[2:27:07] <Zeif00> You sounded more nervous to me tbh
[2:27:07] <$TheGreatSkenardo> like from a butt
[2:27:10] <$cade_calrayn> "I ignored them because I can't read!" - Paige, 2021
[2:27:11] <+Jonny_Worldbeater> Not shitting your pants on stream? That doesn't sound very Paige-like.
[2:27:19] <$Puhff> oh no did pat and plague leave?
[2:27:19] <%Estuko> I feel like it's getting used to having a V-tuber model and trying to make it animated without having to worry about your physical facial expressions? It's kinda like putting on a new set of clothes for the first time in familiar company
[2:27:24] <%Paralurx> "Playing it up" with certain aspects of the personality a little bit here and there seems like how it tends to be with streaming
[2:27:24] <ne0bunny> everyone has their telephone/online voice. especially those of us with thick accents
[2:27:31] <+floweri> streaming takes all the energy
[2:27:33] <@SoFarFetched> yeah people kinda have a different voice for who they talk to.
[2:27:39] <Vinny_Fives> For the bit I was able to catch of the vtube debut you seemed really comfortable and excited, was great to see actually :D
[2:27:43] <%CubicPhantom> the "speaking-to-a-crowd" patois is way different from casual speech
[2:27:50] <%ospreyworks> Peach's persona is all about being big and strong and putting on an air of grandstanding. it's her wrestling persona.
[2:27:52] <Profmcstevie> "Pat knows me pretty well" well thank goodness
[2:27:59] <CappuccinoGuil> The story was fun!
[2:27:59] <@SoFarFetched> Guys please remember
[2:28:00] <%Rumbutt> I mean I hope Pat knows you well oroLUL
[2:28:02] <@SoFarFetched> Paige is her OWN channel
[2:28:08] <%LysdexicAndVolingit> I call that my teacher voice
[2:28:09] <%ospreyworks> I mean, she's also big and strong in real life
[2:28:10] <%optimasmaximas> why yall gotta start acting dumb chat
[2:28:11] <%Rumbutt> that would be super weird if he didn't
[2:28:12] <@SoFarFetched> and whatever is said on CSB/Woolie's/Pats Channel
[2:28:15] <@SoFarFetched> doesnt mean its okay to sasy in here
[2:28:18] <+TopsyCretes> I've loved you and pat for years so whatever you do is good im sure many feel the same
[2:28:19] <@SoFarFetched> say*
[2:28:23] <%Jack_of_No_Trades> I loved your "existing lore" integration into the vtuber stuff
[2:28:27] <%alternative_flu> you give good vibes always
[2:28:29] <BoxNavy> num num num
[2:28:32] <+HelveticaScenario> So, this v-tuber thing isn't a gag? This is permanent?
[2:28:32] <%alternative_flu> thumbsup.emoji
[2:28:35] <@SoFarFetched> I understand its "oh well she was on CSB/Pat's channel" but remember she has her own set of rules here.
[2:28:35] <+Rofiarf> nervous but having fun is a cute combo
[2:28:38] <Zakaraz> @ospreyworks not everyone has access to the resources but it can be worth the resources. "it takes money to make money" you might say
[2:28:40] <%ShockzNDrawe> I did enjoy the stream as a whole though I will say
[2:28:40] <$TheGreatSkenardo> Tier 3 Subs get to get shit on
[2:28:40] <$rdark_ksu> Wait. Your fiance knows you pretty well? What will they think of next lol
[2:28:51] <yodajr99> day old monster can
[2:28:54] <+sandrews> so like the glass thing too?
[2:28:54] <$cade_calrayn> and that's what makes the lore so funny and engaging, Paige, the realness
[2:28:57] <@SoFarFetched> So dont get upset if you thought something that twas okay to say in another channel suddenly gets you banned in here geefShrug
[2:28:58] <islandsunn> We're living in a material world!
[2:29:06] <+shruke> Especially the cursed by a witch part
[2:29:12] <%JoshManVGH> You were cursed by a witch and feed off of attention?
[2:29:13] <@Jekado> Vtubers are NOT cheap
[2:29:17] <%Jack_of_No_Trades> FOR THE BIT, THERE IS NO COST TOO HIGH
[2:29:19] <@SoFarFetched> yeah Vtubers can be like 2k
[2:29:20] <Arancet> ...cough
[2:29:23] <Profmcstevie> expensive jokes exist
[2:29:23] <BoxNavy> the worlds most expensive bit
[2:29:25] <@MelBrooksKA> @PeachSaliva Ask woolie
[2:29:29] <%Rumbutt> Yeah, what is she, Woolie Vs
[2:29:30] <+GloweyEyes_Sapphire> i have an avatar for my stuff, it helps me with speaking
[2:29:30] <BoxNavy> WOOLIE
[2:29:31] <dan_g_v> ask Woolie XD
[2:29:31] <+floweri> interesting
[2:29:31] <@MelBrooksKA> Woolie bought TWO!
[2:29:31] <islandsunn> I like the v-sona
[2:29:35] <+AnthonyJMax> XD
[2:29:35] <%Ranryu692> LUL Woolie
[2:29:35] <+SharpClaw_> high quality avatars are quite expensive
[2:29:36] <islandsunn> lmao
[2:29:36] <%alternative_flu> something about mcdonalds
[2:29:39] <cgreene64> I think the VTuber is good b/c it makes it easier to stream casually
[2:29:39] <@Jekado> You even have props
[2:29:40] <%ssjklyco> Good job, Pat
[2:29:40] <islandsunn> I forgot about woolie
[2:29:40] <%LysdexicAndVolingit> Two of them!!!
[2:29:43] <CappuccinoGuil> Woolie DID get two rigs
[2:29:43] <%CubicPhantom> I appreciate Woolie's commitment to gags
[2:29:45] <@Jekado> like the WcD hat
[2:29:46] <+polothegreatest> xD
[2:29:46] <vonmaultke> WOOLIE CALLED OUT LUL
[2:29:47] <+SharpClaw_> thousands
[2:29:49] <President_Pariah> so are you gonna gift Pat that Toilet Vtuber rig so yall can have coop streams?
[2:29:49] <$TheGreatSkenardo> I figured the rig was really so that pat could vtube as a a bowling ball on top of a toilet.
[2:29:50] <Joem1k> But don't you buy mcdonalds a lot ?
[2:29:50] <%Estuko> Vtuber rigging and model making is REALLY luxurious. Plus imo it'd be kinda mean to the artist to make their work a short lived joke
[2:29:50] <%ospreyworks> @zakaraz yeah, if someone's gonna go to the trouble of commissioning an artist and someone to rig it, wouldn't you assume that they were invested in using it?
[2:29:54] <%Ranryu692> Pat with the drive-by
[2:29:55] <Joem1k> That's a expensive joke right?
[2:30:02] <islandsunn> Instead of cat-face
[2:30:05] <+polothegreatest> LUL LUL
[2:30:06] <islandsunn> Big upgrade
[2:30:07] <@Jekado> Its great you can stream without having to dress up or get ready
[2:30:10] <Zeif00> It's a vehicle for you to stream more, it's great
[2:30:12] <+brigiethebaguette> I hope you feel safe and.comfortable as a vtuber compared to being on stream ❤️
[2:30:15] <$rdark_ksu> To frugal for a vtube joke, but bought those hooker boots in 2.4 seconds
[2:30:15] <+floweri> sounds like a win win
[2:30:16] <@SoFarFetched> yeah and Paige did a LOT of communication with the Artist on what she wanted for her vtuber.
[2:30:17] <%ssjklyco> How dirty have you gotten the mask already after eating with it on
[2:30:17] <@Jekado> i'm glad i get more Paige streams for sure!
[2:30:18] <%ospreyworks> no vtuber gatekeeping allowed.
[2:30:18] <+SaphronBlackbourne> If I had a VTuber avatar I'd sure be fuckin' using it
[2:30:20] <islandsunn> It beats a j-peg of elmo
[2:30:24] <BackflipCharm> If using a vtuber lets you feel more relaxed on stream then fantastic.
[2:30:26] <%JoshManVGH> Oh man! when do you and Creepy Porp start your own Canadian Hololive?
[2:30:32] <zerointelligence000> It's cool to change things up as well so this is a welcome change
[2:30:35] <ltbabylucien> I like your avatar, and if you want to vtube, that's cool! You have a fair point about it being good for streaming comfortably.
[2:30:37] <ChangelingBard> Plus you can make silly faces at chat and no one will know
[2:30:37] <GabiTheMermaid> You’re awesome and WONDERFUL
[2:30:43] <$cade_calrayn> Like, this allows Paige to *stream more often* and that's NOT a bad thing AT ALL
[2:30:51] <+sandrews> @PeachSaliva They way I view it VTubers, Some are characters some are just themselves cranked up. Most a persona.
[2:30:52] <+HelveticaScenario> I've been away from this channel for a while, came back and didn't know what was going on, that's why I asked.
[2:30:54] <%Ranryu692> LUL Peach no
[2:30:54] <blue8moon> LUL
[2:30:55] <%Rumbutt> it's nice and comfy, convienient, AND you get to become anime gorl. it's a great thing
[2:30:56] <+MrATheGreat> good try tho
[2:30:57] <@SoFarFetched> yeah vtuber paige definitely helps paige more.
[2:30:57] <@Jekado> PIG
[2:31:10] <%ospreyworks> @cade_calrayn This!!
[2:31:13] <%alternative_flu> what about giving us the finger
[2:31:15] <%BakiinPlaysStuff> We're getting more Paige streams, so I'm pretty happy psaDogchamp
[2:31:18] <%CubicPhantom> I can't wait to see seasonal variant Peach.
[2:31:19] <+floweri> is the rigging uncomfortable?
[2:31:23] <@Jekado> You can stream with your balls out... like Pat... geefBlank
[2:31:23] <GabiTheMermaid> Whatever helps you stream more and be happy Miss Peach
[2:31:29] <+RealThiele> @SoFarFetched its fine i aint mad :)
[2:31:29] <+sandrews> oh man I messed up my message
[2:31:31] <yodajr99> best part is nobody can see the wickdonlds bags
[2:31:31] <cgreene64> I think Vtubing is a good middle ground between "Ease of stream for no-cam" and "a face to react with of little cam"
[2:31:34] <+RowenCleric> this model seems super great, it doesnt do the weird eye twitch thing some vtubers do
[2:31:35] <Zeif00> @Jekado oooop
[2:31:41] <+floweri> i would love to have a vtuber model - dont know much about how it works!
[2:31:43] <atgithursdays> Do you think your vtuber has back problems?
[2:31:48] <@Jekado> the rigging is just a camera its like using a web cam
[2:31:49] <+sandrews> I mean vtubers are like wrestlers.
[2:31:51] <ChangelingBard> I was thinking about getting a rig after your stream, seems very fun
[2:32:00] <DracaenaLeaf> there is that mcdonalds crown!
[2:32:01] <blue6sub6remnant6> Is it like a headpiece or is it camera tracking?
[2:32:02] <@SoFarFetched> @RealThiele its just a general thing I gotta remind chat,cause some people have come in poutting about it.
[2:32:05] <+lynlyn_ow> @PeachSaliva there was a lite totem near your hook
[2:32:06] <islandsunn> when you're a vtuber no one knows when you shit your pants
[2:32:06] <%ospreyworks> this vtuber setup is really impressive
[2:32:06] <blue8moon> it even captures the patented peach saliva squint
[2:32:08] <+brigiethebaguette> I do miss Elmo cameos
[2:32:08] <%JoshManVGH> I look forward to the power creep and the inevitable 9 Tailed Peach Saliva form
[2:32:12] <%EyeFarted> Mustard-stained face: HIDDEN
[2:32:14] <TheMostJill> Escapism, ye.
[2:32:15] <GuyverTypeL> The future man
[2:32:18] <+FackinCrazy> Well I think we can all agree wether you like or dislike vtubers that bears should not be able to vote
[2:32:19] <@SoFarFetched> Cause Chat tends to forget the things said on the other channels aren't okay in here geefAwk
[2:32:20] <@Jekado> Everyone should have a persona... Maybe even a FURSONA geefSmugAF
[2:32:22] <islandsunn> Found you faker!
[2:32:34] <BoxNavy> fun.. jermaPluto
[2:32:36] <GabiTheMermaid> Exactly!
[2:32:40] <@SoFarFetched> so I just gotta do my mod thing and remind people.
[2:32:41] <+SaphronBlackbourne> Personas are fun! I wanna get a model like you Paige. <:
[2:32:53] <@SoFarFetched> like when I kept telling chat no hints geefPoint
[2:32:55] <%ospreyworks> yeah, gotta remember that poking fun at a streamer who doesn't know you doesn't go over the same way as poking fun at a friend
[2:32:58] <%Paralurx> Fun?! On MY video game stream?! HOW FUCKING DARE?!?!?!
[2:32:59] <yodajr99> vtubing is interesting a lot of my friends are into it
[2:33:00] <+MrATheGreat> LUL
[2:33:00] <$cade_calrayn> I'll admit I do miss the Elmo and Gief interruptions too but still
[2:33:01] <islandsunn> Everyone does have a fursona, most juse don't know what it is yet
[2:33:02] <BrianDLahey> its funny that we can tell when you look at chat
[2:33:03] <mr_saturday93> just finished a game as killer when a survivor just left two of his teammates behind as he opened gate
[2:33:03] <+SaphronBlackbourne> I think streaming is a fun idea but I'm not comfy with a face cam
[2:33:06] <+RealThiele> @SoFarFetched you do a good job and keep the sewage flowing well
[2:33:08] <Dante_Namikaze1> still can't believe the second potato thing that happened
[2:33:09] <+MrATheGreat> right beneath thier nose
[2:33:17] <$cade_calrayn> @SoFarFetched yeah jeez I don't think anyone listened to you last time :(
[2:33:28] <%ospreyworks> I'd love to get an intermittent pet cam
[2:33:33] <@SoFarFetched> it was a LOT of deleting messages during the baba stream geefBruh
[2:33:37] <plzza_kun> :o
[2:33:38] <BoxNavy> @SoFarFetched twitch chat in general has this obsessive need to help even when they are told not to and will be reprimanded when they do. its so weird
[2:33:41] <%Credfield_> Credfield_ subscribed at Tier 1. 
[2:33:43] <@SoFarFetched> 90% of my chat ended up being "deleted message" during baba
[2:33:45] <@Jekado> geefChair
[2:33:48] <Turf_Wind_and_Fire> It's so wild that technology has gotten to a point where we now have responsive animation. Like it's honestly really cool when you think about it @PeachSaliva
[2:33:52] <zerointelligence000> are you able to say how much time/money this costed as a whole? asking for a friend
[2:33:53] <$cade_calrayn> I'm one of Buns's mods and I can't imagine trying to control that kinda shit on this level
[2:33:56] <mr_saturday93> damn sry fetch
[2:33:56] <%Credfield_> Hiya Paige, I learnt about Aunty Donna from you and Pat doing the Bikey man song and I went to a concert and lifting up Broden, anyway they have another show in my town and I got 4th row tickets
[2:33:59] <Zakaraz> @ospreyworks i'm not saying its disingenuous to be a vtuber. there are just people out there willing to do the popular thing to get more attention (not that paige would)
[2:34:02] <BoxNavy> it was fun :)
[2:34:05] <%optimasmaximas> lota backseaters in the bobba stream
[2:34:08] <+SaphronBlackbourne> Chat, be like me: scream internally instead of backseating
[2:34:09] <yodajr99> what would Elmo's persona be if he was a vtuber
[2:34:09] <islandsunn> *bonk*
[2:34:09] <ChaosedStar> yeah and this also means we get more paige. and support her with disability stuff. people are such asses my god
[2:34:10] <plzza_kun> I AM ANTI FUN SwiftRage
[2:34:11] <@SoFarFetched> I understand people WANT Paige to solve the puzzle. But whats the point of telling her the answer if she wants to solve the puzzle herself.
[2:34:17] <TurtlesAndTentacles> Oh no I knew it was real but you were hurting me Paige
[2:34:18] <$TheGreatSkenardo> This pig lady is kind of dunking on your bros
[2:34:18] <Zeif00> Good job during that Baba stream mods <3
[2:34:24] <GabiTheMermaid> Paige you’re my fav part of the week when you stream, don’t worry bout being “fake”
[2:34:38] <+MrATheGreat> @yodajr99 Elmo would be the handsomest boiiii
[2:34:38] <+brigiethebaguette> @credfield_ omg I have had chop chop stuck in my head for ages. I think they sold out for their show in my city but I need to take another look
[2:34:42] <+SharpClaw_> "entertainer putting up a persona ?,unheard of"
[2:34:43] <%ospreyworks> yeah, let people do and let do
[2:34:45] <ConflagrationsGaming> honestly if this makes it easier for you to stream, i'm glad you have it
[2:34:45] <plzza_kun> :O
[2:34:52] <@SoFarFetched> @BoxNavy Yeah I understand its unfortunately the frustration some people have of "I SOLVED THIS ALREADY,SOLVE IT ALREADY geefDense " so they try to give too many hints to move the gameplay along.
[2:34:52] <+MrATheGreat> NEEEEEEEEEERD
[2:34:52] <mr_saturday93> nice!
[2:34:52] <islandsunn> lmao
[2:34:53] <BoxNavy> EleGiggle
[2:34:53] <yodajr99> @mrathegreat Yees
[2:34:54] <%Credfield_> @brigiethebaguette they added more shows to their dead cat tour
[2:34:55] <DracaenaLeaf> nice
[2:34:56] <%ospreyworks> do and let do
[2:34:56] <ConflagrationsGaming> nerd !!!!!
[2:34:56] <$TheGreatSkenardo> the jukes
[2:34:59] <%Paralurx> damn Paige with the JUKES
[2:35:04] <%JoshManVGH> nnnnEeee
[2:35:05] <+CapOfAllFools> oh my god what a nerd to you think he even KNOWS???
[2:35:06] <+MrATheGreat> That dork probably like ANIME LUL
[2:35:07] <$TheGreatSkenardo> pig hocks actually snapped
[2:35:08] <mr_saturday93> she didn't kick the gen?
[2:35:09] <+brigiethebaguette> @credfield_ I'm in Adelaide so I'll take a look!
[2:35:17] <%JoshManVGH> neeeEEEEEERRRRrrrd!
[2:35:17] <%Estuko> The thought of Paige sticking her leg out and Pig tripping and getting laughed at by survivors is killing me, "NEeeeeeeeeeeerd"
[2:35:19] <@SoFarFetched> Like chat was DEFINITELY getting mad the puzzles weren't being solved. Where its like "okay YOU go play Baba is you on your own time then geefAwk "
[2:35:20] <Zakaraz> @ospreyworks i'll drink to that
[2:35:22] <ConflagrationsGaming> you know this is a dumb question and i didn't watch the entire vtuber debut stream, but are those fox or cat ears
[2:35:25] <+polothegreatest> sipsipHonk sipsipHonk
[2:35:33] <%Credfield_> @brigiethebaguette oh dang, so am I
[2:35:33] <DracaenaLeaf> fox
[2:35:39] <@SoFarFetched> YEAH DEVOUR HOPE AGAIN
[2:35:40] <@SoFarFetched> AND OFF
[2:35:41] <Profmcstevie> Baba is You is ENTIRELY puzzles, if chat helps the entire game falls apart LUL
[2:35:45] <ConflagrationsGaming> fox!
[2:35:49] <+Kinetico5> AYO ANIME PEACH
[2:35:50] <@SoFarFetched> Well chat got better later.
[2:35:50] <$Mohrgears> inspiring feelings how dare you, we have too many
[2:35:54] <@SoFarFetched> thankfully
[2:36:00] <@SoFarFetched> still some messages,but not horrible as before
[2:36:02] <%BettyMwwaahh> "chat was getting mad" sounds like chat needs to be picked clean
[2:36:05] <@Jekado> The issue is i had to remember the puzzles faster then chat because i had to make sure the mods knew what the answer was to delete the hints in chat.
[2:36:05] <%ShockzNDrawe> you I inspire a lot of stupid shitposts for me to draw
[2:36:06] <The_UnfathoMarble> Big and strong emotions!
[2:36:06] <islandsunn> peach is really carrying this team
[2:36:10] <BoxNavy> the fun of watching games like baba is watching people stumble around trying to solve the puzzles. its no fun when someone spoils the solution :(
[2:36:11] <%ospreyworks> life's too short not to have fun and try new shit
[2:36:15] <$cade_calrayn> lol FarFetched, if they were getting mad, I dunno why they came to Paige's stream. Watching her do puzzles isn't about progress, it's about the journey
[2:36:15] <@Jekado> I was like UH SOLVE IT QUICK!
[2:36:17] <ChangelingBard> They should add suplexing to this game
[2:36:18] <yodajr99> feels
[2:36:22] <$cade_calrayn> the long and laborious and hilarious journey
[2:36:23] <+MrATheGreat> LUL Paige just stealing all of this nerd's lunch monies
[2:36:25] <%Paralurx> I still remember the first Baba stream, my brain was melting watching it and I couldn't stop laughing
[2:36:35] <%Jack_of_No_Trades> I just get super hype in baba when she finally gets the solution. Its like soccer, it takes a while but when a shot scores its super exciting
[2:36:40] <%ShockzNDrawe> idk baba's funny though
[2:36:47] <GabiTheMermaid> That’s why I would feel nervous to stream, if people got pissed at me for not solving puzzles
[2:36:50] <@Jekado> Also some puzzles have serval solutions so i got to remember all the solutions if possible
[2:36:54] <+SaphronBlackbourne> Paige's... very good puzzle skills are what I came for
[2:36:58] <BoxNavy> i do scream at my monitor during the baba streams but its genuinely some of the most fun ive had on twitch
[2:36:58] <blue6sub6remnant6> Baba is great. I could never watch it live. I don't trust myself that much.
[2:36:58] <radda343> once I opened three straight jigsaw boxes and got nothing and died, but pig is wife so it's fine
[2:37:00] <$TheGreatSkenardo> I don't see what people showing up to watch someone play Baba were expecting
[2:37:05] <+RootVeggie> So instead of a binary survive or you lose system, is the goal of a match to get as many points as you can?
[2:37:06] <+sandrews> are the puzzles like super hard?
[2:37:07] <GuyverTypeL> We love you paige don't worry
[2:37:08] <@SoFarFetched> Nooo you're fine paige
[2:37:10] <@SoFarFetched> geefPoint
[2:37:10] <@Jekado> YOU SHOULD!
[2:37:11] <BoxNavy> naaah do its cool
[2:37:11] <+RealThiele> i actually thought your last baba session went pretty well. only one cry and overall quick
[2:37:13] <Zeif00> DO IT
[2:37:14] <%optimasmaximas> dont say that :(
[2:37:14] <Turf_Wind_and_Fire> So how does the VTuber thing work? Like it's fascinating to see how responsive it is to everything.
[2:37:18] <%TheLakinessMonster> I bought Baba because of your streams.
[2:37:18] <BoxNavy> it was a good debut dude
[2:37:20] <%alternative_flu> usually fake fans are calling for that
[2:37:21] <plzza_kun> OH
[2:37:22] <+Rofiarf> please do
[2:37:22] <%Kenzo2000> Paige, if you do get into 14, you would be a natural Tank with all the heat you draw
[2:37:22] <%Estuko> It's great Paige! I recommend it It super cheered me up at a doodoo work day
[2:37:23] <%Paralurx> But I missed the debut and wanted to go back and check it out
[2:37:24] <+floweri> post it!!!
[2:37:26] <Skye_Logan> dinkLoop dinkLoop dinkLoop
[2:37:29] <+brigiethebaguette> please do
[2:37:29] <Visorak6> The way I see it is it just marks out who to get rid of
[2:37:29] <%BettyMwwaahh> a good mod would just shoot on site instead of letting assholes ruin Paige mood like this
[2:37:30] <deusvultdegenerate> I mean the vtuber model is pretty cool too
[2:37:31] <blue8moon> that's why you just yell at the screen when streamers are trying to solve puzzles, instead of typing it in chat :)
[2:37:34] <+brigiethebaguette> let's do a poll!
[2:37:36] <ChangelingBard> Post it Post it!
[2:37:40] <+MrATheGreat> JUST IN TIME
[2:37:41] <zerointelligence000> I've thought about playing this game but only because I imagine the pig looks cute under the mask
[2:37:43] <@SoFarFetched> Your debut was fine Paige
[2:37:46] <+SaphronBlackbourne> It was a good debut! You had me smiling the whole stream
[2:37:46] <The_UnfathoMarble> Honestly Paige, you solve most of the puzzle in a way that I could not even see until you solved it, it was great!
[2:37:50] <TurtlesAndTentacles> But I thought you said be proud of who you are ad stuff
[2:37:54] <islandsunn> GOTTA GO FAST
[2:37:59] <yodajr99> spin moves HahaReindeer
[2:38:00] <+SharpClaw_> hater's gonna hate anyway
[2:38:02] <peachy996> Nah do it anyway. Let the doritos fall where they may
[2:38:03] <+polothegreatest> sick juke
[2:38:03] <$TheGreatSkenardo> She proper wants you
[2:38:07] <%BakiinPlaysStuff> nah post it post it. it was a ton of fun bakiinBlindSuccess
[2:38:07] <+Kinetico5> reactionary people are gonna be like that no matter what :/
[2:38:17] <blue6sub6remnant6> That's right, don't post the debut. Give ONE GUY that much power.
[2:38:28] <GrieverRexxIII> BibleThump BibleThump BibleThump BibleThump
[2:38:30] <$cade_calrayn> it's disheartening to hear people shit on her, that's the thing
[2:38:32] <islandsunn> is that a saw helmet
[2:38:33] <Zakaraz> pot it. ignore the baby shit-fit
[2:38:38] <+strakillias> Don't worry about it Paige, the only embarrassing part of your debut was the content of what you were reading. And that was kinda the point
[2:38:38] <@SoFarFetched> Paige you're fine,first streams be like that. Korone messed up a lot on her first stream.
[2:38:38] <%Credfield_> It's easy to get scattle brained when you cant tell where they are
[2:38:39] <%ospreyworks> you gotta start somewhere
[2:38:41] <SGrim> @PeachSaliva As one of hundreds of opinions which don't matter, it was an entertaining stream.
[2:38:42] <$cade_calrayn> like even if she can shrug it off it's still disheartening
[2:38:44] <Dante_Namikaze1> wait how angry were people because I wasn't there for it
[2:38:45] <$TheGreatSkenardo> Welcome to cyberspace, baby
[2:38:52] <%Estuko> Being super confident and not anxious during a debut would be impossible for anyone.
[2:38:54] <The_UnfathoMarble> I did miss the debut though :(
[2:39:00] <yodajr99> gamebo3Cat
[2:39:00] <President_Pariah> i usually don't watch the streams, prefer the ytube vods, i'd like if you uploaded all the things. I feel like you've chosen a path, might as well lean into it, ignore the haters.
[2:39:02] <+sandrews> Look man the shark got shit on for her first stream
[2:39:02] <$Sphincter_Spelunker> Pat was a mess during his 1st stream
[2:39:03] <TallYoda08> <3 <3 <3
[2:39:03] <BoxNavy> i mean, i dont think ive ever seen a vtuber debut where the person wasnt nervous as fuck
[2:39:05] <+floweri> it's just a little moment in your stream history
[2:39:06] <$rdark_ksu> Everyone shits their pampers the first time. Thats why its the first time.
[2:39:08] <@SoFarFetched> LIke Korone I think accidentally had her mic muted,music playing too loud and discord accidentally showing for her first stream.
[2:39:13] <%BlackStarAura> The debut was fine! Life’s too short for people to be angry at petty bullshit like this
[2:39:16] <+thickshield> I thought it was cute for what its worth.
[2:39:24] <GrieverRexxIII> Is Ash Williams a good Survivor?
[2:39:26] <Quiet__Viking> I can understand the feeling "I could've done better"
[2:39:27] <@SoFarFetched> So you're totally fine on your first vtuber debut and chat will agree geefPlz
[2:39:28] <Dante_Namikaze1> F
[2:39:28] <%Ranryu692> @PeachSaliva your debut genuinely went better than IRyS's did, it's fine
[2:39:29] <+RealThiele> you did fine paige, and you are still doing well.
[2:39:33] <%Credfield_> @PeachSaliva Hiya Paige, I learnt about Aunty Donna from you and Pat doing the Bikey man song and I went to a concert and lifting up Broden, anyway they have another show in my town and I got 4th row tickets
[2:39:33] <%ospreyworks> and peach, you already have the kind of presence that so many streamers work months on building
[2:39:36] <@SoFarFetched> YOU'RE S TILL FINE PAIGE
[2:39:37] <+Snacbo> It was your first time doing anything like that; anyone would have been nervous. It was a fun stream regardless
[2:39:38] <@SoFarFetched> geefPoint
[2:39:41] <%ssjklyco> I see no point in getting upset. If people don't like it, they can just leave. Not sure why you would continue to watch something that keeps making you upset.
[2:39:42] <$Sphincter_Spelunker> Kuh-rony
[2:39:49] <RetroCop87> don't forget, "a"
[2:39:51] <%alternative_flu> I may not know much about vtubing but i thought your debut was dope
[2:39:53] <+polothegreatest> ded
[2:39:55] <deusvultdegenerate> People who watch vtubers are just so much more awful than people who watch people with a face cam or whatever
[2:40:00] <tanarath> kuhronie
[2:40:18] <deusvultdegenerate> Gatekeeping cartoon avatars is pretty hilarious
[2:40:19] <@SoFarFetched> no I think he means chat in general who keep wa ching and get mad.
[2:40:21] <%ssjklyco> Not saying you are upset, the people who are getting upset at you
[2:40:22] <yodajr99> does it attract less attention if one person fixes the generators
[2:40:34] <@SoFarFetched> Klyco means "IVE BEEN WATCHING THE STREAM FOR 4 HOURS AND IM STILL MAD ABOUT VTUBER"
[2:40:39] <@SoFarFetched> kinda weird chat people
[2:40:39] <GuyverTypeL> @ enjoy what you accomplished, you're a lucky lady paige, love your content
[2:40:40] <President_Pariah> you can just do what all youtube creators do, NEVER READ THE CHAT
[2:40:40] <%ospreyworks> you have such a good stream host energy
[2:40:43] <+SharpClaw_> the internet in a nutshell XD
[2:40:47] <%JoshManVGH> Nah you did fine. I had feelings but only because I wasn't expecting a whole persona and backstory. That's my deal to deal with not yours. It was a fun stream
[2:40:50] <%alternative_flu> use some kush
[2:40:53] <GuyverTypeL> Oof
[2:40:53] <%BlackStarAura> Hate watching, I don’t understand it
[2:40:55] <President_Pariah> only read twitch chat
[2:40:56] <Profmcstevie> As opposed to all the good things people might say, never let losers detract from the things you wanna do LuvSign
[2:40:58] <$Sphincter_Spelunker> take your 420 drops
[2:40:59] <RetroCop87> never forget Paige, Twitch chat is toxic. We're definitely no exception
[2:41:03] <+Kinetico5> delta 8
[2:41:05] <+RealThiele> one guy feeling pretty dumb right now
[2:41:05] <%BlackStarAura> “Hate watching” as a thing
[2:41:08] <@SoFarFetched> Depends on the perks
[2:41:09] <+Kinetico5> in minecraft.
[2:41:11] <%BlackStarAura> Why is it a thing
[2:41:14] <GrieverRexxIII> The v tuber looks good very clean animation
[2:41:17] <%Credfield_> If they are doing autographs after the show want me to try and get you or pat some merch?
[2:41:22] <+ClericOfSparda> the vtuber thing is cute and I like it more than a pic of Elmo
[2:41:25] <+brigiethebaguette> I think it's super brave
[2:41:26] <@SoFarFetched> Theres a perk that can let you know if more than one person is working on a generator.
[2:41:28] <%spadoinkle> Watched the debut at work. Don't remember it being negative. Let it be. If you don't feel great about it now it'll be a comparison for how much better it'll get.
[2:41:40] <$TheNewZealandStory> @yodajr99 if the killer has discordance, yes
[2:41:56] <+TopsyCretes> yes there is a perk called discordance that highlights gen in yellow
[2:42:01] <@SoFarFetched> Yeah Discordance is what its called.
[2:42:08] <%ssjklyco> So what happened with your car? Why is it being shipped?
[2:42:13] <$Sphincter_Spelunker> @spadoinkle she was so nervous people that she was putting on an act. That's about all I remember
[2:42:15] <@SoFarFetched> its pretty much 'Is it better to be low profile and have one person working at a gen vs having multiple people work for it"
[2:42:20] <+TopsyCretes> Legion perk
[2:42:25] <%alternative_flu> super nsfw but I liked their art a lot
[2:42:28] <BoxNavy> very :)
[2:42:30] <$Sphincter_Spelunker> lottas tits and dicks
[2:42:35] <Zeif00> SeemsGood
[2:42:35] <+LensWander> Ideally though having two people on a gen helps, three's a crowd
[2:42:36] <%ospreyworks> also, Peach, my sister and her GF are fans, and I texted them when you did your last stream. I was like, "Yo, she's a vtuber now and she's doing more Baba!!"
[2:42:37] <zerointelligence000> I enjoy spice
[2:42:39] <+RealThiele> Anubis <3
[2:42:39] <Arancet> @ssjklyco she droves it to the states then flew back
[2:42:40] <+SharpClaw_> da boobas
[2:42:40] <CappuccinoGuil> They are incredible
[2:42:40] <zerointelligence000> of all kinds
[2:42:43] <@Jekado> don't look at it with your parents around.
[2:42:46] <GuyverTypeL> YWAH, gotta watch it at work with my boss
[2:42:50] <%Credfield_> nonsense, I have been watching Pat for about 9 or 10 years and always enjoy you guys, I'd be happy to try to get you guys something if I can get it autographed, I'll watch out for that po box
[2:42:54] <Dementedpenguin> Oh yeah I checked out their twitter..... I was like "Oh." But talented!
[2:43:02] <@SoFarFetched> paige maybe put a warning at the "Vtuber" credits if someone looks while you're not streaming? geefLul
[2:43:03] <+shruke> @Jekado unless your parents are REALLY cool
[2:43:03] <%rumtumtugnutz> Paige is technically a hentai! Hooray!
[2:43:04] <Visorak6> But what about the LORD
[2:43:04] <Quiet__Viking> what if my dogs in the room
[2:43:07] <CappuccinoGuil> When you popped in with your rig, I was like "is that... noooo.... did she get WFN?"
[2:43:27] <blue6sub6remnant6> @SoFarFetched Is the risk not part of the fun?
[2:43:34] <JonKhan> Welp I was warned, can confirm. Very NSFW
[2:43:34] <%TheLakinessMonster> I love seeing how many artists power their career through horny. It's such a funny thing.
[2:43:55] <@SoFarFetched> @blue6sub6remnant6 I mean its a safety so people aren't like "JESUS FUCK GIVE ME A WARNING I HATE THAT STUFF" sort of problem geefShrug people get weird about some art on the internet.
[2:44:01] <+SaphronBlackbourne> I like the curly hair strands sm
[2:44:05] <BoxNavy> im glad you can stream more :)
[2:44:06] <CappuccinoGuil> @TheLakinessMonster horny pays bills
[2:44:24] <+RealThiele> Horny Furries are loaded just sayin
[2:44:28] <blue8moon> well you have a very pretty foxy lady now
[2:44:30] <$Sphincter_Spelunker> m'lupus
[2:44:33] <GuyverTypeL> @peachsaliva how was the process of designing your vtuber persona? did you have to draw something?
[2:44:34] <DracaenaLeaf> this is a great way to stream more
[2:44:34] <%Credfield_> Can I DM or @ you on twitter of the video my friend got of me lifting up Broden at the show?
[2:44:35] <BoxNavy> the brainskin
[2:44:37] <@SoFarFetched> Cause I definitely know one person clicked on the link and went "I hate everything I hate this stuff" on the reddit.
[2:44:42] <+Kinetico5> about to be the next eGoblin signed to vShojo
[2:44:42] <zerointelligence000> false. your brain is hidden in your skull
[2:44:46] <Zeif00> I feel like a Cimrai + PeachSaliva collab would be divine
[2:44:49] <$rdark_ksu> stream more is good, more Paige is good
[2:44:50] <%alternative_flu> Lupus? More like Poopus.
[2:44:57] <%alternative_flu> But for real that stinks dawg D:
[2:44:58] <$Sphincter_Spelunker> There was one stream where you had purple knees. It was nuts
[2:45:02] <Visorak6> Its a strong debuff
[2:45:04] <%Credfield_> M'Lupus, the M stand for mustard
[2:45:10] <%Kenzo2000> Oh no Paige. You said the art was spicy and I thought you meant like curry, but now I have seen porn
[2:45:16] <%ospreyworks> oh, Peach, you should add a Lady D hat for Halloween!
[2:45:25] <Profmcstevie> Be unperceivable, become M I S T
[2:45:29] <tanarath> This is a GREAT way to do it, Paige. We don't care, but you should be comfortable
[2:45:29] <@SoFarFetched> yeah the artist is VERY 18+
[2:45:31] <+Rofiarf> no i love it
[2:45:32] <%BlackStarAura> Completely understandable
[2:45:38] <+electric_bees> nooo its super cute
[2:45:39] <@SoFarFetched> I mean to each their own
[2:45:42] <%Sotetsu> I love your design. Simple is better.
[2:45:43] <@SoFarFetched> its cute and fits you
[2:45:46] <$cade_calrayn> Generic? It's very true to you, Paige
[2:45:47] <+SaphronBlackbourne> Are lupus lesions painful? They kinda look like it. :c
[2:45:48] <blue8moon> but you even got your pearls D:
[2:45:50] <BoxNavy> simple designs are good
[2:45:50] <+ClericOfSparda> I like your design. It's you.
[2:45:57] <DracaenaLeaf> the design is growing on me
[2:45:59] <+strakillias> I do love the more frequent streams. Viva la Vtuber Paige
[2:46:00] <Profmcstevie> It's called not being overdesigned, jeez. It's easier to add than subtract
[2:46:01] <BoxNavy> very good reasoning
[2:46:02] <GabiTheMermaid> I love seeing you as a vtuber because if I was a streamer I would not want to be on camera. your avatar is dope
[2:46:03] <%Rumbutt> people are too enamored with busy design imo, your's is great
[2:46:03] <$Sphincter_Spelunker> Red Aqua woulda been neat. But copyright could be a mess
[2:46:04] <Jarbal> Vtuber stick figure
[2:46:05] <CappuccinoGuil> The design is spot on, honestly
[2:46:06] <Arancet> its right for you
[2:46:07] <Pistola_Jones> "Uniqueness" aside it feels very "On Brand"
[2:46:08] <anAngryHamster> I think Iron Mouse and Silver Vale are overdesigned
[2:46:08] <$cade_calrayn> Like it's a clear, very-well-drawn representation of Paige with a little spice added on
[2:46:09] <$NitronStreams> the design honestly blew me away. its a perfect interpretation of yourself
[2:46:10] <+floweri> very classy classic
[2:46:11] <Zeif00> It's better than most vtubers, they did a good job
[2:46:14] <GuyverTypeL> It looks great paige
[2:46:15] <%rumtumtugnutz> Someone in the chat is probably yanking it to your tuber right now.
[2:46:17] <bettysharkface> I like it because it's you
[2:46:19] <%Estuko> I like it, it's recognizable and great. IT makes me, someone who suffers from anything complex happy :) <3
[2:46:23] <%Credfield_> I like your model, it shows off you very well
[2:46:25] <%Jack_of_No_Trades> Ear twitches are adorable
[2:46:25] <%ShockzNDrawe> Honestly it's a really good model both from a visual and technical stanpoint
[2:46:34] <CappuccinoGuil> It's a classic look
[2:46:34] <$Sphincter_Spelunker> @rumtumtugnutz they don't need an excuse atpCap
[2:46:35] <%ospreyworks> it's simple, but it's also so well animated!
[2:46:38] <Jarbal> Less is more.
[2:46:42] <%AncelDeLambert> any plans for Halloween funsies?
[2:46:47] <Profmcstevie> Degenerate
[2:46:52] <zerointelligence000> Your model's your own so it's weird that people would complain
[2:46:54] <eyeobject> I like the nice mustard lady
[2:46:57] <blue6sub6remnant6> "Needs more belts" - Tetsuya Nomura, probably.
[2:46:58] <@SoFarFetched> I mean I assume its because people have seen other Vtuber models and assumed you would also go very detailed.
[2:46:58] <+SharpClaw_> who goes to a stream to look at the avatar anyway
[2:47:01] <%rumtumtugnutz> @sphincter_spelunker true
[2:47:02] <+SaphronBlackbourne> It's what i expected, VTuber Paige. I like it.
[2:47:02] <$Sphincter_Spelunker> you know all about mold
[2:47:04] <%ShockzNDrawe> yeah but people will always get their expectations shattered.
[2:47:04] <TurtlesAndTentacles> Too much stuff can ruin the soup
[2:47:04] <%Kenzo2000> Ironmouse is a busy design, but I don't think I would say overdesigned. I feel like it all makes sense on her
[2:47:06] <luftraumm1> honestly I feel most vtubers are way too Much
[2:47:06] <acepangolin1> I love the vtuber you made!
[2:47:12] <@SoFarFetched> yes
[2:47:13] <@SoFarFetched> he did
[2:47:15] <TurtlesAndTentacles> Im a little drunk, but you geet me
[2:47:16] <Zeif00> yea
[2:47:16] <%AncelDeLambert> uh oh
[2:47:25] <%Estuko> But we also get people who complain about beefers being TOO big. People complain for anything and call it "critique" your design is fantastic <3
[2:47:26] <@SoFarFetched> he had a bit of a rework on some things.
[2:47:32] <+CaptainPyron> Hey, simple design's fine. You can add silly things onto it without it clashing too much.
[2:47:35] <acepangolin1> i feel like this design fits you really well.
[2:47:38] <%AncelDeLambert> @TurtlesAndTentacles gief you? psaGiefrail psaDogchamp
[2:47:38] <Jarbal> I would say the only criticism I have of the model is that the forehead makes Code Lyoko blush
[2:47:45] <CappuccinoGuil> You asked for a design you'd be comfortable with, and isn't that your goal? To be more comfortable streaming? I think it's great.
[2:47:47] <Theo_Marks> why is the vtube not simply a giant talking peach
[2:47:49] <+strakillias> Simple Design leads to later elaborate costumes (hopefully)
[2:47:59] <%AncelDeLambert> no but be a skeletahn
[2:48:00] <@SoFarFetched> she wants to FUCK the skeleton not BE the skeleton geefDense
[2:48:02] <%LysdexicAndVolingit> She wants to bone the Bones
[2:48:05] <@Jekado> "love"
[2:48:06] <blue6sub6remnant6> @Jarbal LUL
[2:48:09] <%Estuko> Add-ons like a cute little skelly hair pin?
[2:48:10] <BoxNavy> love :)
[2:48:12] <bettysharkface> Plus you could get some wacky or fancy outfits later for like, Halloweens etc
[2:48:13] <Profmcstevie> I wish to be IN the skeleton, not BE the skeleton. God
[2:48:13] <Arancet> paige has one skeletal leg
[2:48:14] <%Idziman> but peach, you are what you eat
[2:48:16] <eyeobject> Paige is an expert on the bone pron
[2:48:19] <cgreene64> Yeah, some VTubers oiverlays get pretty insane/distracting I think the cleaner is good
[2:48:23] <%JoshManVGH> @jarbal Oh the forehead is nowhere near that big!
[2:48:27] <@Jekado> WHAT you did that turkey drawing!
[2:48:27] <TurtlesAndTentacles> @AncelDeLambert Gief to meeee
[2:48:28] <Jarbal> I didn't take art classes to make a model lol
[2:48:28] <@SoFarFetched> yeah honestly thats fair
[2:48:30] <Ravioli_Ronin> You’d think most people would be glad to not have a hyper-detailed/intricate or distracting model on the screen
[2:48:35] <+floweri> should make her your profile picture
[2:48:35] <+The_Protagonist> you wish to BONE the skeleton
[2:48:36] <+WeLucklessJacks> Any plans to convince Pat to get a skeleton vtuber avatar?
[2:48:38] <%Ranryu692> that outfit is super cute and gives me the big gender envy LUL
[2:48:38] <$Sphincter_Spelunker> @Jarbal damn, that's a deep cut
[2:48:39] <$cade_calrayn> Also, Paige, having a skeleton on-screen all the time would be super distracting for you, wouldn't it
[2:48:39] <+sandrews> those are some detailed jeans
[2:48:39] <@Jekado> Paige is forgetting about HAND TURKEY!
[2:48:46] <+The_Protagonist> thepro95Ripper thepro95Ripper
[2:48:47] <Jarbal> @JoshManVGH it starts to challenge
[2:48:47] <%LysdexicAndVolingit> I missed the conversation about who made the rig? Who was it?
[2:48:48] <%AncelDeLambert> me either. Which makes all those years in college doing fine arts shit really pointless in hindsight
[2:48:49] <yodajr99> how do you be in a skeleton
[2:48:52] <BoxNavy> i like the jiggly ears
[2:48:53] <%Estuko> @Ranryu692 it gives me SAME gender envy LOL
[2:48:54] <%BakiinPlaysStuff> Yeah but I look at the model and go "Oh cool that's Peach" and honestly the rigging is so good and you use it well with your expressions
[2:49:03] <GuyverTypeL> Pat wants a fucking triangle as his vtuber persona
[2:49:13] <+FackinCrazy> I like that it looks like real clothes
[2:49:15] <%LysdexicAndVolingit> @GuyverTypeL nah; cube
[2:49:17] <%AncelDeLambert> I can never think of WHAT to draw, so it's impossible to practice
[2:49:21] <@SoFarFetched> @LysdexicAndVolingit information down below in her "About Me" But its WFN_art on twitter that has a VERY 18+ twitter.
[2:49:25] <+The_Protagonist> PatCubesAt
[2:49:27] <%AncelDeLambert> I don't doodle naturally
[2:49:29] <%LysdexicAndVolingit> @SoFarFetched thanks for the heads up!
[2:49:32] <blue8moon> ngl the outfit is cute and I totally want it >.>
[2:49:36] <%alternative_flu> literally a triangle
[2:49:39] <blue6sub6remnant6> @GuyverTypeL This. 90 degree angles.
[2:49:39] <+sandrews> I thought pat wanted a toilet
[2:49:39] <%JoshManVGH> How many streams have we had since the debut?
[2:49:41] <Ravioli_Ronin> Pat toilet Vtube when
[2:49:42] <BoxNavy> pat the featureless triangle
[2:49:42] <Profmcstevie> A balding triangle
[2:49:43] <@Jekado> Shes even got the BOOTS
[2:49:44] <%Kenzo2000> @PeachSaliva Did you watch the six hour hentai tag rating stream with Mouse and Nyanners? It's a goddamn work of art.
[2:49:50] <@Jekado> the model is very good
[2:49:54] <@SoFarFetched> @JoshManVGH this should be the 5th one
[2:50:00] <thepardack> why not a cube for pat? I thought pat loved cube
[2:50:07] <$Sphincter_Spelunker> @Kenzo2000 SCUSE ME? when was this
[2:50:10] <yodajr99> an emoting triangle
[2:50:14] <@SoFarFetched> She did Monday Debut,Saturday-Monday I believe,then today.
[2:50:20] <%Kenzo2000> Like two days ago
[2:50:21] <%JoshManVGH> @sofarfetched That's a great number! That's Vtuber tech!
[2:50:27] <$Sphincter_Spelunker> who's stream
[2:50:28] <%Ranryu692> @Ranryu692 it made me wonder if having a vtuber made with no intention of streaming is too big a waste of money LUL
[2:50:29] <@SoFarFetched> LUL
[2:50:33] <%EyeFarted> IT WILL NEVER BE A SKELETON
[2:50:34] <deusvultdegenerate> I remember Nyanners from 4chan, she's distilled internet and it's great
[2:50:38] <@Jekado> wow just one hook really?
[2:50:40] <+LastnameSilverLastname> Press Y to Shame
[2:50:48] <BoxNavy> not the cow...
[2:50:52] <+CaptainPyron> Even in my worst games, I refuse to quit.
[2:50:54] <$NitronStreams> DISHONOR
[2:51:02] <%Kenzo2000> It takes them like five hours to reach "S" alphabetically
[2:51:19] <%Credfield_> A compilation of paige panickisms would be very funny
[2:51:26] <%Kenzo2000> It's on Ironmouse's channe
[2:51:29] <%JoshManVGH> Come on, 11 year olds were able to fight this thing off, and they didn't have a toolbox!
[2:51:29] <%Credfield_> shit fuck balls in my ass shit
[2:51:37] <Jarbal> the fuck
[2:51:39] <@SoFarFetched> ah yes
[2:51:40] <+CaptainPyron> Get back on Netflix you overgrown naked mole rat.
[2:51:41] <+sandrews> jesus 5 hours for s
[2:51:41] <@SoFarFetched> the PALLET VACUUM
[2:51:43] <%JoshManVGH> Did it just hoark on the pallets...?
[2:51:44] <$TheNewZealandStory> @CaptainPyron there's really nothing to be gained from sticking around in a match you arent having fun in
[2:51:50] <%AncelDeLambert> could she have crawled over to drop down that stairwell?
[2:51:53] <%Estuko> @JoshManVGH Guess who said it! James Rolfe or Peach Saliva! lol
[2:51:56] <+LastnameSilverLastname> Was that a rainbow flag on the hook LUL
[2:52:03] <$rdark_ksu> wow the rainbow flags are still there. honestly suprised
[2:52:03] <BoxNavy> theres somethign very funny about that horrible beast lugging you around like a sack of potatos
[2:52:05] <+The_Protagonist> was it though? lol
[2:52:07] <%Credfield_> @LastnameSilverLastname There's a pride flag charm
[2:52:13] <+LastnameSilverLastname> Nice
[2:52:15] <%Estuko> I have pride flag charm still c:
[2:52:16] <%spadoinkle> I kind of don't want a vtube for Pat. I want Paige to be the vtuber, and so when people find out Pat has a fiancé they only discover an anime. Plus she should have her own thing.
[2:52:24] <@SoFarFetched> I mean might as well take the bloodpoints and go geefShrug
[2:52:29] <Zeif00> It takes 5 people to make a match
[2:52:30] <%Credfield_> Not when it comes at the expense of your team
[2:52:32] <%Treuan> Pain
[2:52:38] <@Jekado> just get the points at that... POINT...
[2:52:45] <%ShockzNDrawe> yeah if you leave your kind of be tabking the match for your teammates
[2:52:45] <Lodestarrobot> if you dc then you kinda sandbag the other players
[2:52:49] <%AncelDeLambert> YOOOOOO he just dodged the hit by dropping!
[2:52:49] <+The_Protagonist> I feel like Pat would only use it for like... when he doesn't feel like being on Camera or for goofy stuff
[2:52:50] <@SoFarFetched> Like if you're like "Im done with this game" just let yourself die on hook then and leave with the bloodpoints.
[2:52:54] <%WhereIsWill> these dcs tho LUL
[2:52:56] <PartyFavors> just you and me, Tapp
[2:53:01] <@Jekado> I guess you can say that DCing is... POINTLESS! geefSmugAF
[2:53:01] <+polothegreatest> imagine quitting LOL everytime
[2:53:04] <%Estuko> Maybe the killer will be nice and let you go?
[2:53:05] <$TheNewZealandStory> @Lodestarrobot nothing's stopping them from dcing too
[2:53:07] <thesugardaddy111> nah that's just pure salt if people just dc because their losing
[2:53:15] <+The_Protagonist> also no, it's being a sore loser, if you're not having fun don't bother playing
[2:53:19] <@SoFarFetched> you should mend
[2:53:23] <%Estuko> I've let players who were abandoned go by dropping at hatch
[2:53:28] <%AncelDeLambert> I can see DCing if it's your final game of the day
[2:53:29] <zerointelligence000> Does this game have a penalty system for dc?
[2:53:37] <%AncelDeLambert> "this was my last one, why stick around"
[2:53:38] <$TheNewZealandStory> @zerointelligence000 currently, no
[2:53:39] <@SoFarFetched> He wanted you to escape
[2:53:42] <+SharpClaw_> qeues for 15 minutes then leaves after encountering some difficulty
[2:53:52] <+LensWander> may the killer have mercy on Paige
[2:53:55] <blue6sub6remnant6> @The_Protagonist I dare anyone to argue with this.
[2:53:55] <thesugardaddy111> it's a hatch kinda game is guess
[2:53:57] <Dementedpenguin> I've had people DC on me because I spent like 5 seconds finishing a generator rather than save them immediately. Like really? LUL
[2:53:59] <+ImaMFnPrincess> @ImaMFnPrincess is new here. Say hello! HeyGuys
[2:53:59] <+The_Protagonist> @Estuko yeah that's kinda normal etiquette for killers now, i think
[2:54:01] <@SoFarFetched> yeah bottom level
[2:54:03] <$TheNewZealandStory> survivor queue times have been pretty quick lately
[2:54:14] <+ImaMFnPrincess> Hiya @PeachSaliva What program do u use for your avatar?
[2:54:23] <+polothegreatest> HeyGuys
[2:54:43] <$Sphincter_Spelunker> reee
[2:54:46] <eyeobject> Any plans on collabing with other vtubers?
[2:54:51] <$TheNewZealandStory> in general if i get spirit, twins, or a lagging huntress, i'm dcing, that shit aint worth playing out
[2:54:51] <+LensWander> Be nice, Demo...
[2:54:53] <%waltzqueen> de,odoggy
[2:55:00] <radda343> I love this map because of how many references to the movies there are but it' also an indoor map and I hate them
[2:55:01] <%Credfield_> Hey @PeachSaliva want me to @ you on twitter of the video my friend took of us lifting up Broden at the album tour?
[2:55:03] <%Estuko> Eh, of course he hooks the only player who didn't dc
[2:55:03] <+ImaMFnPrincess> thank u
[2:55:11] <+Soliloquy123> With two DCs he could at least throw you a bone and give you hatch...
[2:55:25] <@SoFarFetched> That just sounds like quitter talk and not willing to learn.
[2:55:25] <%JoshManVGH> Is the puppeting rig like mocap stiff without the face dots?
[2:55:31] <%Estuko> "Sorry" -still hooks
[2:55:34] <Ravioli_Ronin> I saw someone using like an iPhone for the LIDAR for that good tracking
[2:55:38] <Profmcstevie> Take personal issues to a singleplayer experience, don't let down the team
[2:55:43] <+ClericOfSparda> Fair
[2:55:53] <%ShockzNDrawe> nothing personal kid
[2:56:00] <@SoFarFetched> I still remember when one survivor admitted to reporting every Mike Myers cause they just don't like him and always D/C geefShrug
[2:56:02] <$TheNewZealandStory> i dont care if its crappy to do, i'm not obligated to play out a match that is just going to be boring/annoying
[2:56:10] <bevyrage> @JoshManVGH it does actually have a puppeting rig with mocap face dots but they're not required to be able to run the program or have face capture by default
[2:56:10] <Lodestarrobot> when id play more i'd usually give hatch but recently i just end up forgetting
[2:56:22] <+floweri> just play the game tho
[2:56:22] <+The_Protagonist> @TheNewZealandStory when you join a team game, you actually kind of are
[2:56:23] <+Snacbo> Love the new rig! I'm glad it's helped you to feel more comfortable with streaming ^^
[2:56:25] <+Parlsain> Sounds like someone who shouldn't play game with other people. lol
[2:56:28] <BoxNavy> no one cares do your thing i guess
[2:56:33] <+LensWander> I've only been carried to hatch twice as a last survivor
[2:56:37] <$TheNewZealandStory> i didnt say anyone's shitting on me, i'm just responding
[2:56:37] <+SharpClaw_> then don't play team games prick
[2:56:37] <%optimasmaximas> its a social obligation
[2:56:38] <deusvultdegenerate> Don't have to justify yourself here it's the internet
[2:56:45] <%JoshManVGH> @bevyrage Neat!
[2:56:47] <GuyverTypeL> O O F
[2:56:48] <+The_Protagonist> @TheNewZealandStory since you can get banned from constantly dropping in some games
[2:56:51] <%Lion_kun> When is the most salty you have ever gotten playing a game?
[2:56:52] <$Puhff> is only gaem. why u haev to be mad???
[2:56:55] <Carquar> Holy fuck what's up with the hostility in chat xD
[2:56:58] <@Jekado> Lets calm down and move on should we?
[2:57:03] <+ClericOfSparda> Man, don't play team games if you're going to drop out in the first sign of trouble
[2:57:08] <%waltzqueen> Hey, Chat! How's your posture? 1-800- Are you shrimping?
[2:57:17] <@SoFarFetched> DbD brings out the weirdness

[2:57:21] <BoxNavy> im SHRIMPIN shrimpin
[2:57:24] <%AncelDeLambert> today is a pretty shit day, I can say that much personally
[2:57:28] <%Jack_of_No_Trades> Oh man
[2:57:28] <%peyodogo> oh the archers were a trip
[2:57:29] <deusvultdegenerate> WITH THE HUGE ARROWS?
[2:57:29] <$TheNewZealandStory> @TheNewZealandStory i really don't care. dbd isnt that game
[2:57:30] <@Jekado> OH YEAH
[2:57:31] <$Sphincter_Spelunker> @waltzqueen ...no. Maybe. Stop calling me out
[2:57:31] <+Soliloquy123> Oh, the Anor Londo archers?
[2:57:31] <ConflagrationsGaming> i DO remember the archers
[2:57:32] <%Credfield_> the bow knights at anor londo
[2:57:33] <+ClericOfSparda> sipsipGears
[2:57:34] <+AgniBrandt> YEAH
[2:57:35] <%Credfield_> with the small birdges
[2:57:36] <Zeif00> I member that stream
[2:57:36] <Ravioli_Ronin> NotLikeThis NotLikeThis NotLikeThis NotLikeThis
[2:57:37] <@Jekado> Dark Souls... geefSip
[2:57:38] <zerointelligence000> I've seen the clip
[2:57:39] <+AgniBrandt> That was some CONTENT
[2:57:40] <Faustgesicht> Anor londo archers?
[2:57:41] <%AncelDeLambert> You launching yourself into SPACE was pure entertainment
[2:57:42] <thesugardaddy111> oh God yeah the archers
[2:57:42] <blue6sub6remnant6> @TheNewZealandStory That's right newzealand. They don't pay your sub.
[2:57:42] <%JoshManVGH> The Anor Lond fuckwits?
[2:57:43] <%Lion_kun> Archers were amazing
[2:57:53] <$TheNewZealandStory> but i am relaxed, im just responding to people talking to me
[2:57:53] <%waltzqueen> @Sphincter_Spelunker i'll never stop caling you out
[2:57:54] <%Lion_kun> When you bounced off the wall.
[2:57:56] <GuyverTypeL> B R E A T H E
[2:57:57] <$cade_calrayn> Remember when you bounced off the Knight's shield and fell off the ledge? XD
[2:57:58] <blue8moon> everybody hates anor londo archers
[2:58:04] <@SoFarFetched> HOIVES
[2:58:05] <Wydamn> The archers clip was one of my favorite parts, where you bounced off the wall with your greatsword
[2:58:08] <+ClericOfSparda> HIVES
[2:58:09] <ltbabylucien> Gently crochets a giant rainbow granny square to the sound of survivor screams and Paige's chatting
[2:58:09] <BoxNavy> 🐝
[2:58:11] <%JoshManVGH> Fucking dragon bow bastards.
[2:58:13] <+tkzhyon> sup paige what's goin on with new zealand?
[2:58:14] <%waltzqueen> Hey, Chat! Hydration check!
[2:58:16] <peachy996> When you smacked the wall
[2:58:17] <%doomunderthestairs> I go back to the highlights of that video often just for a good laugh
[2:58:24] <%peyodogo> i hope elden ring has big archer energy
[2:58:31] <peachy996> And flew 10 feet away
[2:58:32] <morningmoondude> it's when the sun goes down?
[2:58:33] <%alternative_flu> we changing games?
[2:58:45] <%alternative_flu> woo
[2:58:52] <%Credfield_> I played a bunch when my boy nemesis came out and got rank 1 killer
[2:58:53] <%JoshManVGH> Hopefully the horse is immortal
[2:58:55] <$TheNewZealandStory> @TheNewZealandStory i mean, there isnt a sub
[2:58:58] <+floweri> comfort game for me to watch tbh
[2:58:58] <+SharpClaw_> getting big cyberpunk vibes from eldenring
[2:59:00] <Ravioli_Ronin> Does DBD have enough people playing that it’d be worth getting invested in this late?
[2:59:01] <Lodestarrobot> how was baba i didn't get to watch
[2:59:04] <%alternative_flu> I was about to say lol
[2:59:05] <%peyodogo> its fun watching you do dbd, cool to see people play what they like
[2:59:09] <$cade_calrayn> "comfort game" --> "BALLS IN MY ASS!"
[2:59:13] <BoxNavy> if elden ring has a tightroping while some asshole pelts you with bullshit i am returning the game
[2:59:18] <$TheNewZealandStory> @Ravioli_Ronin there's a ton of people playing
[2:59:31] <%Estuko> @Ravioli_Ronin I recommend with friends, it can get ridiculously toxic since it's pvp
[2:59:35] <@SoFarFetched> I just play for fun geefPlz
[2:59:36] <%peyodogo> it do be a game lmao
[2:59:48] <Faustgesicht> I wanna prestige but I don't wanna loose my cakes
[2:59:49] <ltbabylucien> tbh, I like watching/listening to people stream DBD because it doesn't feel like there's a plot I'm obligated to pay attention to.
[2:59:50] <@Jekado> @SoFarFetched BUT THATS ILLEGAL geefGasp
[2:59:50] <GuyverTypeL> just ignore the chat and you'll be fine
[2:59:57] <Zeif00> Player number are higher than ever
[3:00:00] <Profmcstevie> Spooky, team reliant, asynchronous multiplayer fun
[3:00:07] <thesugardaddy111> dbd is a very fun game as well
[3:00:09] <@SoFarFetched> yeah console is a bit iffy,even moreso than PC
[3:00:13] <Lodestarrobot> hooking four people in the basement, however rare that is, feels amazing
[3:00:17] <GabiTheMermaid> Oh nooo I just got it on switch
[3:00:19] <%ShockzNDrawe> is it not cross platform?
[3:00:26] <@Jekado> at least it has support is what I will say
[3:00:26] <Zeif00> Expect the unexpected
[3:00:26] <@SoFarFetched> you can crossplay
[3:00:33] <thesugardaddy111> it is cross platform its just pc is better
[3:00:33] <blue8moon> I don't think I'd enjoy playing this game, but it's fun to watch
[3:00:40] <BoxNavy> monkaS
[3:00:42] <@Jekado> there are some pretty dead games out there DbD at least is being worked on.
[3:00:43] <Theo_Marks> dbd is great!! I feel like a ton of new people just joined (myself included!) from the free weekend and leveled up FAST thanks to the event, and I've had a blast lol
[3:00:44] <%Credfield_> dont play on console
[3:00:45] <%ShockzNDrawe> yeah fair
[3:00:48] <$TheNewZealandStory> the game is virtually unplayable on console right now
[3:00:49] <+Soliloquy123> Consoles are unfortunately very very bad with DbD right now
[3:00:50] <thesugardaddy111> PC master race!!!!!!
[3:01:00] <@Jekado> There is even a Mobile version!
[3:01:00] <@SoFarFetched> @GabiTheMermaid yeah some weird issues right now,they're trying to fix it soon. Hopefully your experience is good!
[3:01:03] <+LensWander> It runs alright on PS5, but I heard there are issues on PS4 and Switch
[3:01:06] <%Credfield_> this isnt scrubquotes Im in top rank, avoid console if you can
[3:01:07] <Ravioli_Ronin> Ok cool, I’m gonna give it a go, but it’s gonna have to be on console SeemsGood NotLikeThis
[3:01:14] <DianaTheAscian> what kinda trouble?
[3:01:15] <%Estuko> I recommend Otzdarva for new players nad the other streamer Peach mentioned if anyone has the name..?
[3:01:17] <%ShockzNDrawe> cross platform had always been kind of weird
[3:01:20] <%JoshManVGH> LUL Hard Drive killing it with their new Headline: "Activision Blizzard responds to controversy by merging with local woman"
[3:01:28] <%alternative_flu> you're brave @Ravioli_Ronin
[3:01:29] <@Jekado> I heard the mobile DbD is... interesting.
[3:01:40] <Theo_Marks> a lot of the console perks are just straight up game breaking in a literal sense, Die Hard literally freezes the game rn
[3:01:47] <%ShockzNDrawe> so is it like a connection issue or controls issue
[3:01:47] <Ravioli_Ronin> Yeah, I’ll keep in mind I’m not playing it optimally LUL
[3:01:49] <+TopsyCretes> it's okay it lag before hit on killer and dead hard is broken you lag so hard the killer gets a free hit
[3:01:51] <%SuckerPunchSyd> @jekado wait how does that work do people play on their phones?
[3:01:55] <+TopsyCretes> on ps4
[3:02:05] <%LysdexicAndVolingit> You don't say....
[3:02:09] <thesugardaddy111> mobile dbd doesn't sound very good if I'm being honest
[3:02:11] <$cade_calrayn> .... Paige, we've known this for years
[3:02:13] <%SuckerPunchSyd> Oh wow
[3:02:16] <@Jekado> @SuckerPunchSyd mobile has their own servers and everything i scaled down.. there is also a bot mode due to... mobile
[3:02:17] <ElenaManetta> why is "console" as in the comfort someone and "console" as in video game console pronounced differently
[3:02:19] <ElenaManetta> they're the exact same word
[3:02:19] <Zeif00> Mobile has some nice features like bots that replace survivors that dc and visual terror radius
[3:02:19] <+TopsyCretes> having fun with it tho
[3:02:23] <eyeobject> BUT YOU'RE SO BIG AND STRONG
[3:02:29] <$rdark_ksu> Oh you worry like it's your job? Welcome to the club lol
[3:02:35] <%SuckerPunchSyd> @jekado thats rad but also yeah makes sense
[3:02:37] <%JoshManVGH> Is it a concern that you're gonna break your phone?
[3:02:39] <%Jack_of_No_Trades> Im always worried I am going to fling my phone across the room when touch controls get too complex for me
[3:02:39] <hearingthenseeing> you're doing well for all your anxiety
[3:02:45] <+SharpClaw_> cuz language is weird
[3:02:45] <@Jekado> @PeachSaliva was it pats stream of playing Teppen that made you scared of Mobile? psaSmug
[3:02:47] <%ShockzNDrawe> you really do have this natural charisma that makes me forget sometimes
[3:02:48] <AFlyingTaco1> @ElenaManetta Because English is kind of bullshit every not and then
[3:03:08] <$cade_calrayn> @PeachSaliva anyone who's surprised by that has never seen a single case of Dignity Chicken
[3:03:14] <blue6sub6remnant6> @Jekado I feel like that was more funny than terrifying. but that's just like, my opinion.
[3:03:15] <$TheNewZealandStory> @Zeif00 i can't believe console/pc doesnt have these features
[3:03:17] <+polothegreatest> if you have gamepass, give it a try just to dab it
[3:03:27] <@Jekado> @SuckerPunchSyd suposedly "Bot mode" might make its way to DbD proper which is... interesting.
[3:03:45] <%BogBodyPositive> Cheer300 hey I just wanted to say as a fellow broken-bodied you make me so happy Everytime I see that you're streaming. I loved the baba stream so much and your new vtub face is 100% adorable
[3:04:05] <@Jekado> @Zeif00 They are "working on it" i think.
[3:04:08] <+SaphronBlackbourne> God what is wrong with Nancy's face on the side
[3:04:12] <+SaphronBlackbourne> Soulless eyes
[3:04:15] <+CaptainPyron> Bots pulled some surprising stuff on me in the tutorial match stuff.
[3:04:48] <%ShockzNDrawe> ShockzNDrawe subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 30 months! 
[3:04:59] <+polothegreatest> "working" like tekken 7 next gen patch LUL
[3:05:15] <blue6sub6remnant6> @polothegreatest DBD is three.
[3:05:38] <+Soliloquy123> I once had a survivor hide in a locker for the endgame and let themselves die to timeout when I was playing Pyramid Head and in the postgame chat they said they were too scared to move. I felt so bad
[3:05:57] <+baconb2587> @Soliloquy123 Dang, that one hit hard.
[3:05:58] <Lodestarrobot> dbd has the problem where the game itself got way bigger than its original foundation. the team def has gotten better at programming i'd like to think but they're building on a pile of spaghetti
[3:06:39] <mustachegolem> is today the day of no booba?
[3:06:40] <mr_saturday93> LUL
[3:06:41] <+LastnameSilverLastname> BBQ go brrrrrrrrrrrrr
[3:06:48] <deusvultdegenerate> Sounds like it's sequel time
[3:06:55] <@Jekado> "he can't see me I CAN"T SEE HIM"!!!
[3:06:55] <mr_saturday93> crazy talk grows in power
[3:06:59] <PartyFavors> Love you ghosty
[3:07:19] <%JoshManVGH> So what is BBQ and Chilli doing that makes it such an essential skill?
[3:07:26] <mr_saturday93> him wraith and doc are my top 3
[3:07:28] <+epide> do you like the looks see skin in dead by daylight?
[3:07:40] <+CaptainPyron> Ghostface is tough with that spotting thing.
[3:07:44] <%AncelDeLambert> well, that's creepy
[3:07:46] <@SoFarFetched> @JoshManVGH whenever you hook a survivor you can see the aura's of other survivors outside a certain radius for a few seconds. But if you hide in a locker,you can prevent it.
[3:07:48] <%peyodogo> holy shit
[3:07:50] <Lodestarrobot> it's shocking how fun ghostface is, i always thought youd be easy to see but i think most survivors rely on terror radius to look for the killer
[3:07:50] <$thomassolorio> o my god she's a durable
[3:07:52] <%peyodogo> yea be safe
[3:07:57] <%TheWinged7> probably, people are creepy
[3:07:57] <mr_saturday93> I feel like GF is op
[3:08:05] <+SharpClaw_> wtf is wrong with people
[3:08:05] <$rdark_ksu> that sounds like a felony
[3:08:07] <%TheWinged7> remember Pat got ladybugs on the mailbox
[3:08:10] <GabiTheMermaid> that’s scary
[3:08:10] <+Taisuru> Go watch the old mailbag videos before making a PO box LUL
[3:08:13] <%Kenzo2000> bees
[3:08:17] <+Caboose2492> tunnel?
[3:08:20] <Profmcstevie> Deadly insects....glitter bombs....you know, lethal things
[3:08:22] <+Caboose2492> yep lol
[3:08:27] <%JoshManVGH> @sofarfetched Ah, thank you!
[3:08:27] <mr_saturday93> Bullshit
[3:08:30] <blue6sub6remnant6> @TheWinged7 I never understood that. Why ladybugs?
[3:08:44] <peachy996> The Bjork one is the scariest
[3:08:47] <@Jekado> @Soliloquy123 There was a Otz video where he predicted where a survivor was in a locker and just started snorting at them, IN THE LOCKER and they DC'd
[3:08:49] <mr_saturday93> remember that guys got mad when a cat. sent a real sword.
[3:08:54] <mr_saturday93> can*
[3:09:00] <$thomassolorio> hey guess what I'm fully vaccinated now I can be in the chat with out my mask lol
[3:09:00] <Lodestarrobot> @TheWinged7 you can send ladybugs thru the mail so people just send them
[3:09:05] <mr_saturday93> FAN FFS AUGOCOT
[3:09:11] <%BogBodyPositive> someone sent pat ladybugs?
[3:09:15] <%peyodogo> hell yeah thomas congrats on your juice
[3:09:19] <+LastnameSilverLastname> V-Tuber fans have always been creepy, but putting trackers in mail is some level of squicky I've never seen before WutFace
[3:09:24] <%SuckerPunchSyd> Rip @mr_saturday93
[3:09:25] <@SoFarFetched> oh yeah they got sent swords and they were like "....what are we supposed to do with this?"
[3:09:26] <mustachegolem> oh she paying atention to the screen just to do the recover QTE is really cute
[3:09:46] <deusvultdegenerate> Wait what, who had a tracker sent to them?
[3:09:49] <%AncelDeLambert> @SoFarFetched Become knights, duh
[3:09:53] <deusvultdegenerate> That's so fuckin weird, dude
[3:09:54] <X2Eliah> Hey Paige did u fix ur eyes yet?
[3:09:56] <PepperJam_Art> Especially when lots of Vtubers are so private, this is honestly disturbing
[3:10:02] <+CaptainPyron> Yay more things to be paranoid about! Man, people are messed up.
[3:10:08] <Ravioli_Ronin> This is why we can’t have nice things WutFace
[3:10:10] <%JoshManVGH> @thomassolorio Congrats! Don't forget to update your firmware to the latest version, or you will sneeze the Windows theme everytime a bell rings.
[3:10:13] <%FallenAngelZelos> FallenAngelZelos subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 5 months! All hail the charming fox mustard lady! <3
[3:10:29] <$cade_calrayn> It's been customary for me to make my boyfriends swords in our first year of dating
[3:10:30] <peachy996> Poor matt caught all the shit for that but its like you gave them a sword
[3:10:51] <$thomassolorio> I knew you were a kitsune the whole time trying to steal pats numnums
[3:10:52] <peachy996> Stop giving ppl weapons lol
[3:10:54] <X2Eliah> @peachy996 wait what
[3:10:56] <radda343> whenever the killer has a choice between two survivors he will always pick you
[3:11:01] <%AncelDeLambert> Paige has become excellent at fixing gens, I never see her miss an input anymore.... and she still pathfinds like Billy from Family Circus
[3:11:04] <$cade_calrayn> Made my first boyfriend Frostmourne, from WoW, and my second boyfriend the Master Sword
[3:11:22] <peachy996> The giftbag thing
[3:11:23] <+CaptainPyron> Whenever you don't want the Killer, he's right there. lol I have the worst luck with that.
[3:11:33] <HibikiYamada> @cade_calrayn that's so rad wth
[3:11:36] <@Jekado> Black smithing seems like a cool skill.
[3:11:38] <+Caboose2492> I'm kinda glad this event is ending some games got way too toxic with people camping hooks or gen rushing the killer just to finish games fast
[3:11:40] <%BogBodyPositive> @cade_calrayn I was just about to ask how many swords/bfs you've had xD
[3:11:50] <$cade_calrayn> lol
[3:11:51] <+Rofiarf> why?
[3:11:51] <$TheNewZealandStory> i feel like dwight is respected
[3:11:52] <mustachegolem> why are those characters reviled?
[3:11:53] <$thomassolorio> how could you get any more cuter
[3:12:02] <$cade_calrayn> I made my ex a Keyblade though as well
[3:12:03] <@SoFarFetched> Gen rushing isn't really a thing when fixing generators is what survivors are supposed to do.
[3:12:05] <thesugardaddy111> I knew about the Meg thing but why Kate's and Dwight's?
[3:12:06] <$cade_calrayn> and I've made my brother Anduril
[3:12:09] <%Kenzo2000> Tunneling Meg is necessary
[3:12:18] <+Caboose2492> little baby dweet
[3:12:19] <+Rofiarf> why is meg reviled?
[3:12:20] <@SoFarFetched> Like they can't do anything else except cleanse totems
[3:12:22] <$thomassolorio> insert Dwight it's true meme
[3:12:26] <%Kenzo2000> I don't want to do it, but I have to
[3:12:32] <+abramax> Nea is quite despised too
[3:12:33] <$TheNewZealandStory> @mustachegolem bad players seem to gravitate towards them
[3:12:35] <thesugardaddy111> meg players have a reputation for being dumb
[3:12:35] <%AncelDeLambert> yeyeye, get that excellent skill check
[3:12:35] <%BogBodyPositive> @cade_calrayn my best friend made his wife a giant ass sword for their 1st anniversary
[3:12:40] <Ravioli_Ronin> Did I imagine this in a fever dream, or did they put the Xenomorph/ripely in here?
[3:12:41] <+abramax> I blame noob3
[3:12:49] <$thomassolorio> that's what you get
[3:12:55] <+CaptainPyron> A Kate ran me around just a game or two ago. She got a key at some point and almost made me kill a nice Feng.
[3:13:11] <+Theophilus567> Did both plague and Pat quit for the night?
[3:13:12] <phantomsleeves> ugh you almost got away with it nooo
[3:13:21] <@SoFarFetched> yeah they were done for the night
[3:13:21] <%AncelDeLambert> GOT YA
[3:13:23] <+CaptainPyron> @Ravioli_Ronin I know there was a surprisingly good mod of the Xeno that got posted to the Reddit.
[3:13:27] <GuyverTypeL> @theophilus567 yep
[3:13:32] <TurtlesAndTentacles> Paige that strat only works once lol
[3:13:43] <%alternative_flu> alternative_flu is gifting 1 Tier 1 Subs to PeachSaliva's community! They've gifted a total of 1 in the channel! 
[3:13:43] <%alternative_flu> alternative_flu gifted a Tier 1 sub to tkzhyon! 
[3:13:44] <Samurai_Jake> Hey Peach! loving the new vtuber edition! So I'm curious, do you plan on sticking with vtubing or will there be afew camera streams sprinkled around? Just curious
[3:13:46] <mustachegolem> where does she go?
[3:13:49] <lemon_lover28> why play survivor if you aren't gonna play Leon?
[3:13:51] <+abramax> Nah you’re thinking of Fortnight, they got alien and ripleyw
[3:13:59] <$thomassolorio> you and pat should name your Chiles pait
[3:14:02] <@SoFarFetched> yeah meg has REALLY good perks
[3:14:05] <X2Eliah> Meg is default
[3:14:06] <brendanyt6509> CoolCat
[3:14:11] <@SoFarFetched> Adrenaline super helps
[3:14:11] <%ShockzNDrawe> that's like saying ryu is for bad players
[3:14:14] <thesugardaddy111> it's just a reputation that Meg players have for whatever reason
[3:14:20] <%AncelDeLambert> got some great perks under that jacket HEYOOOOOOO
[3:14:23] <Lodestarrobot> paige have you ever gotten badly flamed by your teammates? i don't play survivor and im on console
[3:14:24] <+Caboose2492> great perks for beginners and vets
[3:14:24] <%JoshManVGH> Do survivors have baked in mechanics like Killers?
[3:14:26] <phantomsleeves> none of the survivors are truly bad, it’s the toxic cosmetics that tip you off usually
[3:14:30] <+CaptainPyron> I feel like Neas tend to be meaner.
[3:14:39] <PartyFavors> Does self-care claudette in a camo-y outfit actually say anything or is it just sensible for relative starters?
[3:14:39] <thesugardaddy111> idk her perks are kinda meh imo
[3:14:42] <Ravioli_Ronin> @abramax yeah probably saw that and imagined it was for the game where it that crossover would actually make sense LUL
[3:14:46] <+Caboose2492> @joshmanvgh nahh they're all the same
[3:14:49] <%tkzhyon> woah i got a gift sub
[3:14:51] <%tkzhyon> thank yo
[3:14:57] <%tkzhyon> @alternative_flu Thanks for the gift sub!
[3:15:08] <@SoFarFetched> @JoshManVGH each survivor/killer starts with 3 of their own unique perks. At levels 30,35,and 40 they get unlocked so they can appear on other blood webs when leveling up characters.
[3:15:15] <+LensWander> Strange that Meg is targeted since after enough grinding, any survivor can have any perk anyways
[3:15:17] <+CaptainPyron> Kinda both. Definitely good loopers too though.
[3:15:20] <+Caboose2492> adrenaline is one of the best perks in the game in a swf or solo even
[3:15:25] <@Jekado> Some skins are harder for killers to see also
[3:15:26] <+Soliloquy123> Newbie Neas are the ones who just crouch in the corner of the map with urban evasion
[3:15:31] <%alternative_flu> @tkzhyon you're welcome!
[3:15:32] <%BogBodyPositive> I'm curious if I should try getting into this game or if it's too late for me
[3:15:35] <$thomassolorio> undyne would be a great monster
[3:15:46] <passiveaggressivekisses> because it's expected of them
[3:15:47] <@SoFarFetched> @BogBodyPositive never too late to start.
[3:15:51] <Carnadan> oh is peach vtubing now?
[3:16:01] <+CaptainPyron> Yeah, that's a good comparison.
[3:16:08] <+Rofiarf> don't care too much about winning
[3:16:10] <$TheNewZealandStory> @LensWander even at rank 1 though, i've noticed these survivor stereotypes still generally hold true
[3:16:11] <@SoFarFetched> Yeah people join either mainly through new Chapter release,events or such.
[3:16:11] <Samurai_Jake> on a different note, I've been really enjoying Yui in survivor
[3:16:22] <+CaptainPyron> They do have some double XP event soon too.
[3:16:23] <+Brickshurt> The game is peaking in players with resident evil
[3:16:31] <+epide> if ya log on now you might start with a boost
[3:16:31] <+The_Protagonist> it's also basically assuming that the survivor is using the survivor's perk until you actually see that they are using a different one
[3:16:33] <Samurai_Jake> resetting pallettes is fun
[3:16:35] <%BogBodyPositive> mm then try I shall
[3:16:35] <@SoFarFetched> I saw you were trying to play yui but you were afk LUL
[3:16:37] <$thomassolorio> or him from power puff girls
[3:16:37] <+CaptainPyron> So even if you don't get Cakes, it'll be easier than usual.
[3:16:39] <thesugardaddy111> I feel like I'm the only person who ever picks Yun Jin Lee
[3:16:48] <@SoFarFetched> jane got that CAKE
[3:16:50] <+Caboose2492> it's been all about Jill for me since she came out
[3:17:01] <@SoFarFetched> yeah they did
[3:17:03] <+Caboose2492> yeah on Twitter
[3:17:08] <$TheNewZealandStory> i mained yun jin for a while
[3:17:33] <@SoFarFetched> 1.Claudette 2. Meg 3. Feng
[3:17:37] <@SoFarFetched> thats what the order was
[3:17:47] <%GoodnightSnek> Feng min surprisingly was 3rd
[3:17:49] <+akabuldozer> Claudette has the best perks for solo play
[3:17:59] <phantomsleeves> yun jin is so hard to hide with
[3:18:04] <tanarath> sketti is good, though
[3:18:09] <%alternative_flu> I too like picking things I like at restaurants
[3:18:13] <thesugardaddy111> she's pretty interesting, 2 of her perks are pretty good one is trash
[3:18:20] <The_UnfathoMarble> I wouldnt say boring, just a creature of habit
[3:18:30] <thesugardaddy111> also the outfits make you stick out like a sore thumb
[3:18:36] <@SoFarFetched> yeah self care is good for starting off.
[3:18:45] <$rdark_ksu> Ah really? I never order the same meal twice if I can help it. I also want to get stuff I'd not make at home
[3:18:46] <@SoFarFetched> but once you start knowing your way around the game,you learn to not need it.
[3:18:54] <@SoFarFetched> There's definitely perks that are good when starting out to help you along,
[3:19:08] <+CaptainPyron> Cheryl and Jill are my favorites, but Elodie and Zarina are probably my favorite non-guest survivors.
[3:19:10] <@SoFarFetched> and then you start to have a knack for things and then figure out your playstyle.
[3:19:20] <phantomsleeves> do you think you’ll ever give up spine chill? i’m trying to learn to play without it but it’s hard
[3:19:26] <+akabuldozer> Nothing wrong with being consistent if you know what you love
[3:19:30] <hearingthenseeing> I've had the same sub for twenty years
[3:19:47] <mr_saturday93> Have you and Woolie ever thought of playing a puzzle game together?
[3:19:48] <%BogBodyPositive> trying stuff is fun but omg nothing slaps like safe food
[3:19:54] <+Caboose2492> that's happened to me once and it was the best thing ever lol
[3:20:00] <%tkzhyon> spine chill is super good
[3:20:05] <@SoFarFetched> spine chill super helps with stealth killers.
[3:20:06] <+Caboose2492> I just gave up spine chill like 2 weeks ago
[3:20:08] <Profmcstevie> I go to a place for a thing specifically, like shopping. Somedays though you just wanna look around and try something weird
[3:20:17] <$TheNewZealandStory> spine chill is useful for the vault speed buff, but not much else
[3:20:20] <+Caboose2492> ohh dang she blind
[3:20:29] <%tkzhyon> spine chill is like the survivor version of whispers
[3:20:37] <thesugardaddy111> spine chill is pretty useful and I bring it because I'm and information whore
[3:20:39] <%peyodogo> might keep the stream up in the background as i drift off to sleep, gnight folks
[3:20:45] <+akabuldozer> Spine chill beats a lot of undetectable perks, so it's one of the best info tools you can take
[3:20:59] <Samurai_Jake> i rember outgrowing Premonition as one of my regular perks, felt like I was really growing as a player
[3:21:19] <Lodestarrobot> paige would you ever do an escape room? they seem fun but also i think you'd get anxiety
[3:21:29] <+CaptainPyron> Spine chill just makes me even more paranoid. lol
[3:21:29] <+Caboose2492> I had to give up spine chill for we're gonna live forever because dem blood points
[3:21:32] <phantomsleeves> i’m trying to use kindred instead of spine chill, but it isn’t quite as helpful with a stealthy killer
[3:21:40] <+Caboose2492> but yeah spine chill is an amazing perk
[3:21:42] <Samurai_Jake> i still run it every now and then tho
[3:22:12] <@SoFarFetched> sounds good geefPlz
[3:22:35] <thesugardaddy111> bring both kindred and spine chill
[3:22:36] <%alternative_flu> so bossy
[3:22:39] <@SoFarFetched> shes probably worried about discordance
[3:22:40] <+Caboose2492> I've been trying out off meta perks and the game is fun for me again lol it's refreshing not running the same perks
[3:22:42] <%BettyMwwaahh> sipsipRude sipsipRude sipsipRude
[3:22:46] <X2Eliah> That survivor seems like a bit of an ass
[3:22:56] <@SoFarFetched> FARMING MATCH
[3:22:59] <%alternative_flu> oh snap
[3:23:00] <+akabuldozer> Boop the snoot
[3:23:04] <+Caboose2492> boop the snoot!!!
[3:23:08] <+electric_bees> give boops
[3:23:08] <@SoFarFetched> WAIT BOOP THE SNOOT PAIGE
[3:23:08] <PartyFavors> Aw yeah it's one of the Cool Pigs
[3:23:14] <thesugardaddy111> yeah farming March
[3:23:18] <%alternative_flu> hey its that inosuke from that demon slayer anime
[3:23:18] <thesugardaddy111> *match
[3:23:25] <+LensWander> Farmer Pig!!!
[3:23:27] <phantomsleeves> @thesugardaddy111 both is usually good, but sometimes i hate using up two slots on info perks
[3:23:30] <ltbabylucien> ooooooo farming for all
[3:23:30] <PartyFavors> I feel as if Pigs are statistically way more likely to be Pretty Cool than any other killer
[3:23:31] <@SoFarFetched> remember to boop her snoot geefPoint
[3:23:37] <%GoodnightSnek> Lots of farming killers now with the even coming to an end soon
[3:23:38] <%BogBodyPositive> sipsipHellmo sipsipHellmo
[3:23:39] <+Caboose2492> boop it
[3:23:41] <Ozavic> No hate of course, but I'm really not a fan of farming matches, I wanna play the game
[3:23:43] <Lodestarrobot> my fave farming killer is doctor but i don't think the survivors appreciate it all that much
[3:23:53] <thesugardaddy111> @phantomsleeves yeah that's understandable
[3:24:11] <+LensWander> Is it because there's a full set of cakes for the match?
[3:24:27] <@SoFarFetched> Yeah some killers will do farming matches ESPECIALLY during this even because of cake bonus
[3:24:38] <%AncelDeLambert> aight, I need a walk, catch y'all later
[3:24:44] <%alternative_flu> you did it
[3:24:47] <%AncelDeLambert> have fun, Paige, be bignstrong
[3:24:50] <Lodestarrobot> they're still gonna need to hook ppl tho to get most points
[3:24:53] <@SoFarFetched> boop the snoot though geefCry
[3:24:53] <+CaptainPyron> I did have to kinda stop being a Pig main after like 5 games in a row of people trying to Boop the Snoot.
[3:24:53] <blue6sub6remnant6> So, are Nemisis' zombies the new high-bar in powercreep? The more I think about it, the more it seems like you're getting a free information perk that has a chance to keep survivors off a gen or even hurt them if good RNG. What do you think, chat?
[3:25:14] <@SoFarFetched> sometimes the zombies don't always work and you gotta resset them by smacking them.They get stuck sometimes.
[3:25:27] <@SoFarFetched> cause terrain and what not
[3:25:44] <+CaptainPyron> Sorta encourages building power juice when they get stuck though. lol
[3:25:44] <+LensWander> Well I hope the pig gets a few free hooks for his help LUL
[3:25:49] <thesugardaddy111> don't even get me started on nemesis zombies I get salty off of that like no other
[3:25:50] <ElenaManetta> wtf is happening
[3:25:52] <ElenaManetta> was that a party
[3:25:59] <%BogBodyPositive> sipsipSipsipblind sipsipSipsipblind
[3:25:59] <@SoFarFetched> farming match
[3:26:31] <+Soliloquy123> Farming is nice but I get bored of it so fast
[3:26:32] <+CaptainPyron> Nemmy's Zombies are such a wild card though. Some games they're just a vague info perk and others they're blocking every loop. lol
[3:27:02] <eyeobject> now kiss the pig lady
[3:27:05] <JacklongKondur> >.>
[3:27:07] <blue6sub6remnant6> So, they're balanced by virtue of being inconcsistant?
[3:27:14] <blue6sub6remnant6> That's fair then.
[3:27:26] <@SoFarFetched> boop her snooooooot
[3:27:27] <+electric_bees> gotta boop the snoot
[3:27:28] <%alternative_flu> oh my
[3:27:36] <@SoFarFetched> boop the snooooot~
[3:27:49] <@SoFarFetched> how dare geefPoint
[3:27:55] <PartyFavors> Boop boop
[3:27:57] <nivlac_555> boop
[3:28:02] <Zeif00> boopa da snoop
[3:28:02] <wattsbunny> wholesome
[3:28:12] <@SoFarFetched> should've invited the Pig to eat from the trough with you geefPlz
[3:28:13] <Lodestarrobot> dang they didn't get any hooks
[3:28:21] <%YakumoYomi> You have to boop the snoot. It's the law.
[3:28:22] <Faustgesicht> Was the neme zombies the main reason for the survey?
[3:28:25] <%BogBodyPositive> I'm so fascinated by game etiquette
[3:28:46] <%BogBodyPositive> or knows of it
[3:28:52] <@SoFarFetched> yeah its definitely based on the perons
[3:28:53] <@SoFarFetched> person*
[3:29:10] <+LensWander> I like the dropping of the item as a sign of respect
[3:29:27] <@SoFarFetched> @Faustgesicht well it was abit of a mess when the RE chapter came out,RPD map was disabled right off the bat so no one could play it geefLul and they had to remove another map cause nemesis was too tall for it.
[3:29:28] <%BogBodyPositive> yea to me it's not too be expected but it's so cool when it happens
[3:29:33] <+CaptainPyron> It's fun until you get multiple games in a row when you're just trying to play Pig. lol but I love the idea otherwise.
[3:29:35] <%BogBodyPositive> *to
[3:29:48] <Faustgesicht> What map got removed?
[3:30:08] <%alternative_flu> mood i'm still dealing with lower back pains a year later
[3:30:08] <spongeofmystery> Faster Peach, faster!
[3:30:11] <@SoFarFetched> @Faustgesicht temple of purgation was removed temporary so they can fix it. meant to say disabled LUL
[3:30:15] <rinharty6e> i have this game can i help?
[3:30:18] <+LensWander> RPD due to glitches
[3:30:28] <@SoFarFetched> temple of purgation was also disabled cause nemesis was TOO tall
[3:30:31] <@SoFarFetched> but it was fixed
[3:30:34] <%alternative_flu> yeah
[3:30:35] <@SoFarFetched> YOu're fine
[3:30:35] <ElenaManetta> yes
[3:30:36] <passiveaggressivekisses> yes
[3:30:36] <X2Eliah> ye
[3:30:38] <%Ranryu692> yeah
[3:30:40] <+Pendragwn> see who
[3:30:40] <Wydamn> Looks good here
[3:30:47] <+ThatGuyfromMars> Who's talking?
[3:30:53] <$Sphincter_Spelunker> the lights is out
[3:30:55] <@SoFarFetched> @rinharty6e she's not too keen on playing with randoms. Mainly with people she knows like friends.
[3:31:04] <blue6sub6remnant6> @Faustgesicht Hello stranger. How's your new neck of the woods?
[3:31:14] <$Sphincter_Spelunker> it's a weekday
[3:31:17] <rinharty6e> k thanks for the heads up sry about that
[3:31:34] <@SoFarFetched> All good,its just being careful as a streamer cause some can sandbag or say naughty things on the stream.
[3:31:46] <@SoFarFetched> takes caution of someone*
[3:31:46] <+LensWander> It's strange but I think I have more successful escapes during the daytime than at night
[3:31:52] <ElenaManetta> is it because less people are playing, or is there some invisible algorithm where players who have been playing longer are put on low priority list for servers compared to just-launched people
[3:32:10] <usoto215> @usoto215 is new here. Say hello! SeemsGood
[3:32:21] <ElenaManetta> codScout a-ok
[3:32:25] <@SoFarFetched> @ElenaManetta its because WAY more people play survivor than killer at times.
[3:32:31] <mr_saturday93> I'm on console and I'm getting a lot of vamds
[3:32:35] <+CaptainPyron> That's some tinfoil thinking, but I wouldn't be surprised.
[3:32:37] <@SoFarFetched> so it tends to be waiting on a killer to be free.
[3:32:37] <$Sphincter_Spelunker> yeah prob atpCap
[3:32:44] <spongeofmystery> Always embarrassing when there are 4 cakes in the offering screen and you've brought a torn blueprint or something
[3:32:49] <%BogBodyPositive> hello usoto :)
[3:32:57] <usoto215> the vtube character looks super good like wtf
[3:32:58] <@SoFarFetched> yeah its not host anymore,its by servers.
[3:32:58] <+Taisuru> They fixed that ages ago
[3:33:05] <+LensWander> I'm hoping the RE chapter goes on sale soon because it's $15
[3:33:06] <@SoFarFetched> But its still trying to find a free killer to join the match.
[3:33:09] <rinharty6e> thats true i did play with a streamer today and i didn't speack cuz i didn't whant to take the stream away from them
[3:33:37] <@SoFarFetched> Yeah depending on the streamers,they're cool with community playing with them but have rules of course.
[3:33:51] <@SoFarFetched> cause I know a couple others that do community days with followers/subscribers
[3:34:08] <+akabuldozer> Good posture is for suckers
[3:34:11] <+akabuldozer> Like pants
[3:34:26] <%BogBodyPositive> hell yea
[3:34:38] <$rdark_ksu> thats why I play/do everything in my recliner
[3:35:12] <%BogBodyPositive> nothing can hurt you if you lie on the floor all day /s
[3:35:24] <HaroldDonchee> man that humming is creepy with headphones
[3:35:27] <$Sphincter_Spelunker> my dream is to get a projector for the ceiling and lay down like a slob
[3:35:30] <+TopTieramisu> foolishness, paige. foolishness
[3:35:46] <%BogBodyPositive> yea it is so creepy!!
[3:35:51] <$rdark_ksu> out of all the flavors out there, you decided to be cocky

[3:41:28] <thesugardaddy111> aka Keith David
[3:41:33] <@SoFarFetched> Gaston would say "no homo"
[3:41:33] <$TheNewZealandStory> @AFlyingTaco1 frollo? he's as straight as they get
[3:41:34] <%ospreyworks> Facilier is bi as fuck
[3:41:38] <infinityk11> hmmmm. lol
[3:41:55] <Profmcstevie> He uses antlers in all of his deecoraaating~
[3:41:56] <RetroCop87> frollo burned a city in his straightness
[3:41:58] <@Jekado> Maybe they were just... "Bro-ing" out
[3:42:00] <ElenaManetta> he had an entire song about how if he doesn't get pussy he will throw people into hell
[3:42:01] <@MelBrooksKA> LIKE FIRE!
[3:42:01] <thesugardaddy111> Gaston is very manly, what's manlier than 2 men?
[3:42:02] <$Sphincter_Spelunker> the proto incel
[3:42:04] <$rdark_ksu> Gaston is only worried about getting his rocks off, he don't care how it happens
[3:42:04] <+cvp5127> frolos a simp
[3:42:06] <@MelBrooksKA> HELL FIRE!
[3:42:07] <+polothegreatest> frollo is a sinner
[3:42:13] <rinharty6e> u got this game i get camped so hard
[3:42:16] <%BogBodyPositive> but he was also Catholic correct?
[3:42:20] <%ospreyworks> Hellfire is the most dramatic boner ever put to film
[3:42:28] <+polothegreatest> even mary give him a chance, but too horny
[3:42:30] <RetroCop87> Hellfire is the most sexually charged Disney song ever
[3:42:31] <@SoFarFetched> also religion geefThink
[3:42:33] <thesugardaddy111> no antlers are an incredibly straight thing to do
[3:42:35] <Profmcstevie> Disney will never slam an excellent deeply religious film EVER again
[3:42:36] <$TheNewZealandStory> frollo is the realest disney villain
[3:42:37] <SGrim> Frollo screams to the heavens about God making him be an Incel!
[3:42:37] <@MelBrooksKA> Horny murderer
[3:42:38] <%ospreyworks> also creepy church adjacent

[3:42:50] <infinityk11> frollo is tooo horny
[3:42:51] <%CubicPhantom> "she will be mine or she will burn" is a hard sell to children
[3:42:53] <infinityk11> too much
[3:42:56] <phantalime> follows a bit too real
[3:42:57] <%Sotetsu> Gaston wants Belle as a status symbol.
[3:42:58] <qo_op> Where does Madame Suliman score?
[3:43:02] <phantalime> *Frollo's*
[3:43:04] <akarchives> Lord Farquaad: discuss

[3:43:06] <Case_Ah_Dia> Frollo down REAL bad
[3:43:07] <eyeobject> Frollo is incel
[3:43:13] <AFlyingTaco1> What about the villain from The Incredibles 2?
[3:43:14] <+eiightbiitt> whoah when did Peach become a Vtuber?
[3:43:14] <+polothegreatest> i can still hear him
[3:43:17] <ElenaManetta> Frollo is also 100% a religious-based figure since his character hinges on his profession being an archdeacon
[3:43:18] <dan_g_v> how about cruella
[3:43:19] <infinityk11> can't trust Frollo around any woman
[3:43:21] <%Gouf_Troop> Tangeled?
[3:43:21] <%BogBodyPositive> @akarchives we're not ready
[3:43:25] <%Kenzo2000> Gaston is a funny dumbass, but Frollo has people in his basement
[3:43:29] <ElenaManetta> whereas you can just ignore quasi and gargoyles being catholic
[3:43:32] <qo_op> howls moving castle
[3:43:33] <$Sphincter_Spelunker> Helga from Atlantis Kreygasm
[3:43:37] <%Ranryu692> what about Yzma from Emperor's New Groove?

[3:43:40] <infinityk11> hmmmmm
[3:43:42] <thesugardaddy111> farquad is close enough
[3:43:44] <RetroCop87> Farquad was straight or bi, he was just super flamboyant too
[3:43:44] <@SoFarFetched> @eiightbiitt she became a vtuber last monday! Not the recent one.
[3:43:46] <%ospreyworks> Gothel is gaslight
[3:43:49] <%alternative_flu> he straight straight right?
[3:43:49] <akarchives> @Kenzo2000 Kotomine?!

[3:43:54] <HaroldDonchee> lord Farquaad is super straight
[3:43:57] <+Scrivener_exe> Sulliman isn't a villain in the book!
[3:44:02] <+TopTieramisu> adum's favorite character, scar
[3:44:05] <dan_g_v> true
[3:44:11] <thesugardaddy111> captain hook is at least bi look at how flamboyant he is
[3:44:15] <RetroCop87> Lord Farquad strikes me as a villain who would have super progressive views
[3:44:18] <%Gouf_Troop> but, hey. a puppy killed her grandma
[3:44:19] <%alternative_flu> scar just wanted to bang lions all day
[3:44:20] <AFlyingTaco1> Just loves skinnin' those pups
[3:44:20] <Profmcstevie> Cruella does not fuck, she only creates pain
[3:44:20] <@MelBrooksKA> Animal murder sexual
[3:44:22] <+strakillias> No sex, only animal cruelty
[3:44:23] <%Ranryu692> Cruella is a chaotic evil furry
[3:44:23] <$TheNewZealandStory> why does cruella live in a shithole
[3:44:24] <%ospreyworks> I think Cruella had an old, unrequited crush on Anita
[3:44:25] <%LysdexicAndVolingit> Cruella is into Findom (not going to take a read on her LGBT+ group though)
[3:44:31] <%ospreyworks> Hence her hatred of Roger
[3:44:34] <%TheLakinessMonster> Cruella's sexuality is Cruella
[3:44:36] <RetroCop87> puppy fucking MERCED her mom
[3:44:40] <eyeobject> "Some of you may be gay, but that is a sacrifice I'm willing to make" Farquad
[3:44:41] <Profmcstevie> The puppies probably even pointed and laughed at Cruella
[3:44:44] <akarchives> @LysdexicAndVolingit *shut up* I hate that you made me read that
[3:44:46] <+SpecsInSpace> The mad hatter?
[3:44:48] <ElenaManetta> batman's parents should've died by having bats scare them so hard they tripped off a cliff
[3:45:05] <$rdark_ksu> What about the colonial dude from Pocahauntas?
[3:45:06] <%LysdexicAndVolingit> @LysdexicAndVolingit I'm right and you know it! Everyone should have to face this thought now!!!

[3:45:21] <+Pendragwn> @ElenaManetta bats in a trench coat robbed and killed batman's parents
[3:45:27] <+TopTieramisu> but then batman would spend his life fighting bats instead of criminals
[3:45:31] <+ClericOfSparda> I feel like I never get maps like coldwind farm without offerings

[3:46:06] <thesugardaddy111> everyone in wonder hand? sounds like a movie you can't watch with your parents
[3:46:11] <%ospreyworks> Basically, you can pick any Disney villain and there's a 90% chance that they're in the LGBTQIA+ community
[3:46:24] <Lodestarrobot> the real question is why isn't there an ursula walking around

[3:48:52] <%LysdexicAndVolingit> I would like to circle back around to my point that Cruella is into Findom, and having given it more thought, agree that she;s ace because it's all about the power and not about the sex
[3:48:54] <thesugardaddy111> I like how no one is doing anything rn
[3:48:57] <eyeobject> He after that cake

[3:50:51] <%MarylandJutsu> i'd say its more of a trend these days but people have their own reasons for doing it

[3:51:12] <thesugardaddy111> noobs
[3:51:12] <@SoFarFetched> Yeah they tend to be way to scared to do objectives or not familiar with the map. It happens
[3:51:18] <+king_of_beggars> I don't even want to ever think about how people on the internet are made of flesh ever again.
[3:51:19] <+akabuldozer> The discordance is real
[3:51:22] <@SoFarFetched> though when its higher rank T HEN its questionablew
[3:51:27] <Lodestarrobot> yeah vtubing seems really useful if you're feeling like shit or not like making yourself look all dressed up. that's what i'd do
[3:51:38] <phantomsleeves> go find out what that corner feng is doing

[3:52:00] <%Gouf_Troop> were all weird squid brains puppetting meat sacks
[3:52:01] <ElenaManetta> i like seeing the entire right side of the screen fill up with bonus point markers when you escape
[3:52:02] <baphometseinfeld> I have Body Dysmorphic Disorder so pretty much the only way I'd ever show up on camera is by being a vtuber
[3:52:03] <ElenaManetta> feels good
[3:52:07] <akarchives> @king_of_beggars From the moment I understood the weakness of my flesh, it disgusted me. I craved the strength and certainty of anime. I aspired to the purity of the blessed Vtuber.
[3:52:10] <%LysdexicAndVolingit> It makes me sad that vtube rigs won't work for me because I have a beard and glasses; I'd love to mess around with various avatars while I'm teaching
[3:52:10] <ggnore12334> I remember when I used to make chocolate back in my day Chocolate World
[3:52:12] <thesugardaddy111> man lithe is such a good perk
[3:52:14] <$NitronStreams> I thought fun was made illegal years ago
[3:52:15] <$rdark_ksu> I remember the first time I had fun, terrible habit forming drug it is
[3:52:39] <ggnore12334> did you say chocolate! Chocolate chocolate chocolate
[3:52:49] <@SoFarFetched> possibly geefThink
[3:52:55] <thesugardaddy111> no one other person did one
[3:52:55] <phantomsleeves> i fear you might be
[3:52:57] <RickyRelucent> Chocolate oranges.
[3:52:58] <radda343> lithe + dance with me is great too
[3:52:59] <+ThatGuyfromMars> yeah one dude did a gen
[3:53:02] <%alternative_flu> gotta use the john
[3:53:03] <$NitronStreams> they did at least 1 gen while you were being chased
[3:53:03] <+king_of_beggars> It's honestly our first tentative steps into a better future where we leave behind our frail mortal bodies for a digital existence.
[3:53:07] <thesugardaddy111> but like only one
[3:53:15] <ranzorblade> oml
[3:53:19] <ranzorblade> omg
[3:53:20] <@CreepyPorpoise> You can do it
[3:53:31] <thesugardaddy111> yall might pull a victory out of this yet
[3:53:31] <@CreepyPorpoise> big hero time
[3:53:36] <@SoFarFetched> "GO OUT THERE" she wants heals
[3:53:37] <@SoFarFetched> LUL

[3:53:56] <phantomsleeves> yeah she can come get you if she needs it
[3:53:56] <tanarath> SHE DID FOLLOW YOU
[3:54:01] <radda343> this killer seems unconcerned with using his power at all
[3:54:01] <thesugardaddy111> she kinda did
[3:54:02] <@SoFarFetched> usually its better to heal right away as soon as the unhookin happens
[3:54:05] <@SoFarFetched> as long as they are away
[3:54:06] <rinharty6e> gene gne gene don don
[3:54:09] <Faustgesicht> had two farms with sub 15k. greddy survivors
[3:54:15] <@CreepyPorpoise> If they wanted to be healed they shouldn't have been hooked
[3:54:18] <@CreepyPorpoise> clearly
[3:54:19] <@SoFarFetched> SANDBAGGED
[3:54:20] <@SoFarFetched> geefO
[3:54:23] <Murphio_GS> kek
[3:54:25] <$Sphincter_Spelunker> left to die
[3:54:30] <thesugardaddy111> omg you killed that Feng
[3:54:32] <phantomsleeves> LUL
[3:54:34] <+logoth_> If they're so smart how come they're dead
[3:54:36] <$TheNewZealandStory> why not shield the baby
[3:54:38] <sydowoodo> find the hatch paige
[3:54:47] <AFlyingTaco1> So are those zombie things just part of the map?
[3:54:58] <akarchives> @AFlyingTaco1 they spawn in as part of Nemesis' ability
[3:55:05] <Faustgesicht> Why rush gens with 5 cakes?
[3:55:05] <+logoth_> is Peach carrying?
[3:55:08] <@SoFarFetched> Paige is like that bird comic where she's the bird kicking the child out of the nest going "FLY BITCH"
[3:55:09] <@SoFarFetched> LUL
[3:55:10] <RickyRelucent> they sem to be going
[3:55:11] <Prism_Wing> HELLO! It's raid time!
[3:55:13] <radda343> it's a nemesis thing
[3:55:20] <+king_of_beggars> Is Paige playing as that busty mechanic girl from FF XV?
[3:55:23] <AFlyingTaco1> @akarchives Ooooh, of course. Now it makes sense.
[3:55:24] <+polothegreatest> LUL
[3:55:30] <Prism_Wing> Although Twitch seems to disagree lmao
[3:55:33] <$TheNewZealandStory> @Faustgesicht what's gen rushing
[3:55:34] <Prism_Wing> prismw1Pchan prismw1Pchan prismw1Pchan prismw1Pchan prismw1Pchan prismw1Pchan
[3:55:38] <+Soliloquy123> @Faustgesicht Look at how many hook states the killer's got. They're clearly not rushing lol
[3:56:05] <$Sphincter_Spelunker> stealing Eli's racecar bit, huh
[3:56:11] <dreamingsummer> Saa-la-la-liva! Was looking away and goofed it.
[3:56:24] <phantomsleeves> 90% of lithe is making the vroom vroom noises <3
[3:56:24] <@SoFarFetched> @Faustgesicht Gen rushing is not really a thing if doing generators is their main objective LUL
[3:56:29] <Faustgesicht> Oh no, my last three matches were 5 cakes and survivors rushed gens so fucking hard they left with sub 15k
[3:56:31] <Prism_Wing> I don't think the raid worked. Raiding has been scuffed for me this week :(
[3:56:47] <ranzorblade> TwitchVotes
[3:57:02] <%alternative_flu> got my fingers crossed
[3:57:03] <ranzorblade> PowerUpR TPcrunchyroll PowerUpR EntropyWins TwitchVotes TwitchVotes FBtouchdown TearGlove TPcrunchyroll TehePelo PowerUpR Squid3 TehePelo
[3:57:05] <radda343> he slugged her and ran off
[3:57:14] <phantomsleeves> maybe he won’t see you behind gen
[3:57:20] <$TheNewZealandStory> @Faustgesicht you shouldve stopped them by killing them
[3:57:31] <Faustgesicht> True no friendly
[3:57:33] <Prism_Wing> damn. Duffed in the back of the head.
[3:57:36] <+king_of_beggars> At least the balloons are very festive.
[3:57:48] <phantomsleeves> um ok
[3:57:50] <+logoth_> did he just not see you
[3:57:53] <sydowoodo> is he taking mercy on you????
[3:57:54] <tanarath> paige heal
[3:57:56] <@SoFarFetched> think he went to find the feng
[3:58:07] <phantomsleeves> oh no
[3:58:07] <@SoFarFetched> cause slug so she doesnt get hatch
[3:58:17] <Murphio_GS> "Understandable, have a great day"
[3:58:18] <$NitronStreams> F
[3:58:31] <@SoFarFetched> Cause if you want the 4k you make sure you find all of them before hooking,so the last one doesn't get hatch.
[3:58:36] <RickyRelucent> t'isnt tit
[3:59:00] <radda343> I love how Nem just shoves you onto the hook
[3:59:09] <$Sphincter_Spelunker> are you still drinking the energy drink Paige? atpCap
[3:59:13] <@SoFarFetched> they weren't high,they were low ranks
[3:59:13] <@SoFarFetched> LUL
[3:59:24] <phantomsleeves> that feng was bad
[3:59:33] <Prism_Wing> It's been quite a night for dbd
[3:59:37] <phantomsleeves> maybe they’re tired
[3:59:52] <$Sphincter_Spelunker> it is midnight
[3:59:57] <phantomsleeves> 11am tomorrow isn’t it?

[4:01:38] <+king_of_beggars> I should grow my hair long again. I want to get one of those big Farrah Fawcett blowouts. Maybe I can get it done on my beard too.
[4:01:45] <@StridentSong> Heyo
[4:02:13] <$Sphincter_Spelunker> @king_of_beggars don't forget to still get it cut, wanna avoid plit ends
[4:02:20] <$Sphincter_Spelunker> split*
[4:02:20] <thesugardaddy111> head?
[4:02:23] <$AzureGale> Head-on, apply directly to the forehead
[4:02:25] <%king_wragles> Head on requires you to be able to not depend on it, but be smart enough to really use it
[4:02:32] <phantomsleeves> you have to practice the timing
[4:02:38] <%alternative_flu> "head on apply directly to the forehead"
[4:02:38] <@CreepyPorpoise> oh man, I thought you meant the medicinal "head-on"
[4:02:41] <%king_wragles> It's not a worthless perk, but it takes experience and understanding of various tiles
[4:02:43] <@SoFarFetched> yeah with head-on you gotta remember to quietly get in the locker so you don't get found out.
[4:02:46] <@CreepyPorpoise> god, those commercials...
[4:02:48] <%alternative_flu> yeaaaaaaaaaaah
[4:02:50] <emper0rner0> It seems good for stunning killers and saving survivors but it really depends on the map
[4:02:51] <%alternative_flu> 10/10 ty
[4:02:58] <@StridentSong> Yea. It also works well with other locker perks like the one that heals you and Leon's Flashbang as well. So you can use the locker for multiple things
[4:03:01] <RickyRelucent> i was thinkign the headcrab video
[4:03:06] <RickyRelucent> oshit
[4:03:36] <@SoFarFetched> quick and quiet with head on too.
[4:03:37] <%king_wragles> I've seen it paired with deception
[4:03:41] <%king_wragles> Confused the fuck out of me each time
[4:03:44] <ChaosedStar> does this game have any lore?
[4:03:53] <@SoFarFetched> @ChaosedStar yeah it definitely has lore
[4:04:01] <+king_of_beggars> Think the lore is "Shit's evil."
[4:04:05] <RickyRelucent> "Do you want an egg in these trying times?"
[4:04:11] <$Sphincter_Spelunker> @ChaosedStar just biographies really
[4:04:12] <%king_wragles> I kinda hope they never really explain it
[4:04:29] <brendanyt6509> do you like fnaf
[4:04:38] <+Soliloquy123> "Evil demon god feeds off of crushed hope, forces teens and serial killers to entertain it with trials for all of time"
[4:04:41] <%ShockzNDrawe> it's like fortnite but with murderers
[4:04:45] <@SoFarFetched> Yeah they got 'spirited away"
[4:04:47] <ChaosedStar> thats kinda cool tbh
[4:04:47] <mr_saturday93> Not all of them
[4:04:55] <$FrostedZaibatsu> More like hell
[4:04:58] <DuoScratch> The entity feeds on the hope leaving a survivor as they're killed
[4:04:59] <Faustgesicht> It's the worst isekai ever
[4:05:01] <$Sphincter_Spelunker> more like 2012
[4:05:08] <mr_saturday93> some of the survivors are dead
[4:05:08] <%king_wragles> Fuck that, it's your stream not theirs'
[4:05:08] <+ClericOfSparda> well, it's debatable that the survivors are dead. many are just "missing"
[4:05:10] <sydowoodo> play it with cam
[4:05:22] <Prism_Wing> Sheeeeit I beat FFX for thile first time this year prismw1Lara
[4:05:33] <radda343> too bad the uy that makes fnaf is a shit
[4:05:37] <+LensWander> Sounds like the movie Battle Royale
[4:05:39] <$hrbeck_> Welcome to 2015 though, lots of travel to that time
[4:05:40] <RickyRelucent> cant wait for the 40/40 runs

[4:06:33] <Prism_Wing> prismw1Pchan prismw1Pchan prismw1Pchan prismw1Pchan
[4:06:39] <+Soliloquy123> @king_wragles think it's supposed to be concrete being displaced/destroyed
[4:07:17] <ChaosedStar> does each killer come with new music cause thatd be awesome for silent hill
[4:07:22] <%king_wragles> It's a bass enhanced version of Deathslinger's gunshot lol
[4:07:28] <$Sphincter_Spelunker> is triangle boy still cheeked up
[4:07:33] <Prism_Wing> That sound is his cheeks clapping
[4:07:37] <akarchives> @Sphincter_Spelunker they nerfed his ass to shit
[4:07:38] <%king_wragles> Which I guess isn't far from the sound of thunder
[4:07:39] <+Soliloquy123> @ChaosedStar Yep, each killer except for the old ones have their own music for chases
[4:07:44] <emper0rner0> @ChaosedStar Yeah they do, Akira Yamaoka did music when PH got added
[4:07:49] <$Sphincter_Spelunker> lame
[4:07:55] <ChaosedStar> hell yeah thats awesome
[4:08:10] <%king_wragles> Cage time

[4:16:20] <demiiluna> Maybe they could do it like, pictures of the Babadook are scattered around and looking at them makes him stronger? Idk I'd rather have chucky or something though.
[4:16:21] <%BlackStarAura> In a car accident
[4:16:21] <PartyFavors> I thought the Babadook was a metaphor for making out your spider clown trans boyfriend
[4:16:22] <%king_wragles> I remember reading that article you tweeted about the Babadook being a LGBT icon. It was really interesting to read and think about
[4:16:23] <Murphio_GS> babadook is locked in the basement, much like a closet?
[4:16:25] <SpaceCapnCrone> imprison it in the mind dungeon
[4:16:27] <%SuckerPunchSyd> Put your grief in the basement
[4:16:27] <eyeobject> I thought it represented Abe Lincoln because top hat
[4:16:32] <$cade_calrayn> so basically the straights will have to live with us whether they like it or not? I like that
[4:16:32] <%SuckerPunchSyd> Problem solved!
[4:16:36] <hearingthenseeing> Hits home. recently lost a good friend
[4:16:38] <+TMulharin> Baba(dook) Is You
[4:16:49] <daramengirl> bababook resides within nea
[4:16:53] <Prism_Wing> @tmulharin winner
[4:16:54] <SpookyWookyCoconut> When your grief turns into a ghoul. Abbadook!
[4:16:55] <%Gouf_Troop> babadook is the last spirit in pandoras box
[4:16:56] <ChaosedStar> i too treat my trauma like a scary giant cat i keep in the basement
[4:16:59] <akarchives> The real Babadook was the LGBT allies we made along the way
[4:17:00] <%alternative_flu> Dook: Become Baba
[4:17:01] <%SuckerPunchSyd> That too
[4:17:01] <$BlackMage66652> And then Netflix put it in the LGBT section on accident, leading to the realization that the Babadook actually belongs there
[4:17:17] <RickyRelucent> babadook was loki all along
[4:17:19] <seven0fspades> I thought it represented your murderous intent
[4:17:29] <soundcloud_raptor> I'm a fan of the abbadook
[4:17:41] <%TheWinged7> Gday Peach, id donate but im currently broke from car bills, however i did just sign a new contract with a 50% raise + super (401k for you yanks)
[4:18:03] <$BlackMage66652> The Babadook should have rainbow colors for all its attacks if it was in this game
[4:18:28] <seven0fspades> it was so long ago I don't even know
[4:18:30] <$Sphincter_Spelunker> pay in exposure

[4:18:39] <+king_of_beggars> Literal exposure bucks.
[4:18:49] <seven0fspades> but that's what I thought

[4:19:20] <MarsKarl> an entire cake is a personal cake for me 👀
[4:19:31] <@SoFarFetched> Personal cake is only the person using it will get the bonus,while anniversary cake EVERYONE will get the bonus.
[4:19:35] <%mrzeeks> mrzeeks subscribed with Prime. They've subscribed for 11 months! Hey Paige I was looking around at 3D printing files and saw a lot of skeletons and thought of you. Any interest in 3d printing skelemen? Its surprisingly low maintenance since you don't even need to paint.
[4:19:48] <%SuckerPunchSyd> Ahh gotcha big rude for those personal cakes
[4:19:50] <Murphio_GS> A cupcake?
[4:19:51] <+king_of_beggars> Make him sit in the closet while you eat it.

[4:20:52] <%rumtumtugnutz> Clownfuck your balls.
[4:20:59] <+king_of_beggars> Instead of a cake, just get a whole sixer of Costco double chocolate chip muffins.
[4:20:59] <$rdark_ksu> I wish peanut butter was more popular world wide. Its so good
[4:20:59] <+epide> OMG YA GOTTA GET ELMO HIS OWN VTUBER

[4:23:28] <mr_saturday93> whats wrong with him?
[4:23:30] <thesugardaddy111> that doesn't make any sense
[4:23:32] <+fromnibelheim> blueberry cake donuts fuck
[4:23:35] <Profmcstevie> Donuts are so versatile, it's like hating pizza
[4:23:35] <ggnore12334> did you say chocolate! chocolate and I feel like the SpongeBob Meme should come up
[4:23:35] <%Gouf_Troop> DID HE EVER HAVE KRISPY KREME???
[4:23:40] <thesugardaddy111> who could dislike dounts?!?!?!
[4:23:41] <%ssjklyco> Bagels are just stale bad donuts
[4:23:43] <akarchives> @mr_saturday93 would you like the short list or the long one
[4:23:43] <%ShockzNDrawe> do donuts make you go nuts
[4:23:47] <$rdark_ksu> I'm a sucker for a good fritter
[4:23:48] <ChaosedStar> blue berry or maple doughnuts are great
[4:23:51] <+king_of_beggars> How can you hate donuts? Is it like a French thing or something?
[4:23:55] <%SuckerPunchSyd> Doughnuts are so good
[4:23:58] <+DragonArt07> @PeachSaliva Pat dislikes the bounty of Tim Horton's? Sacrilege!
[4:24:03] <+strakillias> Blueberry cake donuts are the best of all donuts
[4:24:03] <$Sphincter_Spelunker> maple donut bars Kreygasm
[4:24:17] <moondog_> the man is an egg
[4:24:19] <sydowoodo> paige, don't you hate bagels tho?????
[4:24:22] <mr_saturday93> @mr_saturday93 no need it was rhtorical
[4:24:23] <thesugardaddy111> you can get literal cake donuts
[4:24:23] <%Gouf_Troop> Krispy kreme is the shit
[4:24:31] <%SuckerPunchSyd> Bengiets are also very good
[4:24:32] <+king_of_beggars> What about like, donut glaze on a croissant?
[4:24:34] <Lodestarrobot> pizza lifehack, put cream cheese on pizza
[4:24:36] <ChaosedStar> Timmys is now garbo
[4:24:40] <%Noodle__Caboodle> how can you hate bagels tho
[4:24:42] <%alternative_flu> it got bought by borger king? lame
[4:24:42] <alliedmastercompy> This Tim Horton's observation is correct
[4:24:44] <%SuckerPunchSyd> Basically just fried dough and powdered shut are
[4:24:45] <SpaceCapnCrone> yeah, it's super bad now
[4:24:47] <%SuckerPunchSyd> Sugar
[4:24:47] <$FrostedZaibatsu> what was the change?
[4:24:48] <Faustgesicht> Yeah that'd kill quality
[4:24:52] <thesugardaddy111> did I get bought by burger King?
[4:24:53] <%SuckerPunchSyd> Wait WHAT?
[4:24:58] <ChaosedStar> Mcdonalds sells their old coffe tho at least
[4:25:02] <AXL808> simple donuts are great, but once you put a bunch of candy or other stuff then it tastes like just sugar
[4:25:03] <thesugardaddy111> cause if so that makes sense
[4:25:05] <%Ranryu692> the college I went to had the first Tim Horton's in the US
[4:25:11] <+DragonArt07> that explains the breif attempt they made to sell burgers
[4:25:12] <brendanyt6509> give up peanut butter or eat all peanut butter
[4:25:27] <%Credfield_> HYEUGH HYEUGH HYUEGH
[4:25:34] <%SuckerPunchSyd> Eat the big peanut from the sky
[4:25:35] <%rumtumtugnutz> Tim Hortons hasn’t been goodsince they starter microwaving everything in the nineties.

[4:25:52] <@Jekado> yeah clown pee bottles are broken
[4:25:56] <$rdark_ksu> Only thing I hear about Tim Hortons any more is their iced coffee ice cream drink thing

[4:26:54] <%Credfield_> he sucks at pressuring people far away
[4:27:07] <+Soliloquy123> He's generally regarded as one of the worst killers in the game
[4:27:11] <daramengirl> Hes better than plague D:
[4:27:15] <%Credfield_> pop goes the weasel is rly good for gen degen
[4:27:28] <%SuckerPunchSyd> Does he spend a lot of time clowning around?
[4:27:32] <+sinderb1ock> Do you play Killer at all Paige?
[4:27:33] <%Credfield_> and bbq and chilli helps him find people and chase earlier
[4:27:43] <%Credfield_> Id say plague is better than clown
[4:27:50] <daramengirl> hmmm
[4:27:58] <daramengirl> but clown has more aoe
[4:27:59] <ChaosedStar> Thats the only drawback of kitsune peach, no peepee
