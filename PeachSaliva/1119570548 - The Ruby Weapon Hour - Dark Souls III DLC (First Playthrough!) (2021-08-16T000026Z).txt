[0:30:10] <GrizzMango> @PeachSaliva Hey Paige, I know you aren't a doctor, but I have a lot of the symproms of Lupus or someo ther kind of Auto Immue Disease. I also have a family history with it.I'm having trouble getting my doctor to take it seriously since these things are tough to diagnose. Any tips on talking to Doctors about this? Sorry if that's a tough question but thanks anyway.
[0:30:17] <%Agami23> paige, thank you.
[0:30:19] <stantheman_97> boobie scary BibleThump
[0:30:20] <SovPho> is there a post it big enough for that?
[0:30:22] <%AncelDeLambert> it's okay, those are just Rushia fans
[0:30:27] <Jetsfantasy> I think they were self-admittedly a porn addict so it wasn't exactly your issue LUL
[0:30:28] <%Dakuu75> "put a post-it note on your fucking monitor to maintain your purity." lol
[0:30:33] <%rumtumtugnutz> why would anyone be offended at the Vboober?
[0:30:41] <+cvp5127> stream only the model to flex on them
[0:30:42] <bob900000> how can someone not like boobs?
[0:30:48] <%RealThiele> @rumtumtugnutz But jesus could be watching at any moment!
[0:30:49] <%ForneusAtSeaWorld> are the fox knockers cat testicles revenge for the complaints?
[0:30:53] <%KeiganOfAstora> A kind "fuck you get out"
[0:30:54] <+Thesaltt> Those buttons workin' overtime
[0:30:54] <%Puhff> i mean, they're not REAL boobs???? they're just 1's and 0's????
[0:30:54] <%thotbane> yeah doesn't everyone like boobs?
[0:30:58] <%BallerSwagBro9k> Honestly fuck those people
[0:30:58] <WakeUpThrow> Wait are people STILL upset by the boobs?
[0:30:59] <benjiFG> I have a thing where seeing people shake their foot makes me go mad so I use windows notepad for that
[0:30:59] <TheArrow_> some day vtuber technology will evolve to the point that people will be able to make client side customizations
[0:30:59] <%TDotGoat> where can we find these Post-it notes?
[0:31:00] <+WutangchickeN> is there a sticky note I can put on the screen that makes the Booba bigger??? wutang6FLAVOR wutang6FLAVOR wutang6FLAVOR
[0:31:01] <+realm_forge> They are more than entitled to their wrong opinion
[0:31:01] <%Sotetsu> Love the model, love the stream. fmgNICE

[0:31:22] <%RealThiele> LUL
[0:31:23] <Bennett_Fracture> following trend is fun eh...
[0:31:25] <nu1x> hey, naysayers are an absolute minority and you should not care :D
[0:31:30] <%Puhff> I am :)
[0:31:30] <peyodogo> idk why people get so weird about this? is that just how the vtuber community is?
[0:31:30] <+logoth_> How many people are complaining about this? Yeesh.
[0:31:32] <+Chewygamer> You overestimate chat by A LOT
[0:31:32] <%freelancebabymaker> the fleshtuber will return
[0:31:35] <DancesWitBalrog> I swear Paige is too kind for twitch
[0:31:38] <%waltzqueen> Your model is fine but I will be happy to see Flesh Paige as well as Skelmo
[0:31:38] <%thotbane> @PeachSaliva do you have human ears too under the hair
[0:31:40] <%Monkeyweed21> next we see Paige's face she will have ascended to her skeleton form
[0:31:40] <%RLT917> the  anti boobs thing is baffling jaboodyMindblown
[0:31:42] <DancesWitBalrog> so wholesome
[0:31:43] <+Hilleltaco> If someone sees your real face then your vtuber avatar dies instantly, it's the rules I'm sorry
[0:31:48] <%RealThiele> yea paige is too good to chat
[0:31:49] <+Undenizen> Intelligent? Make good decisions? Paige do you even KNOW me??
[0:31:52] <+zamatermort> Real Paige is now only available on Pasta Rat streams
[0:31:53] <TurtlesAndTentacles> At least she's not in a hot tub
[0:31:58] <asakura_ayase> I think Paige vtuber is super cool
[0:32:00] <peachy996> Let her do what she wants.
[0:32:03] <Bennett_Fracture> nah it's entertaining to me...
[0:32:04] <%JoshManVGH> How DARE you assume we am smart!
[0:32:04] <TheCheeseWilly> Why the honker wobble tho
[0:32:06] <BigYanno> "I'm not here to judge you or shit on you" god that's a stark contrast from pat's streams

[0:32:07] <%Jack_of_No_Trades> Its fun
[0:32:09] <hearingthenseeing> we just chatting or is there more ds3
[0:32:11] <Jetsfantasy> Paige has a legit excuse, as someone who helps care for people with bad lupus issues
[0:32:11] <%CptCreampuff16> the alternate is she has the cam on but wears a tarp
[0:32:12] <+Romuken> you a scoutmaster?
[0:32:12] <+Chewygamer> @TheCheeseWilly yes
[0:32:16] <+Thesaltt> I like seeing real Paige, but I'm still super excited about you being a Vtuber.  People that don't like Vtubers are just railing against change
[0:32:16] <Bennett_Fracture> use auto tune sometime...
[0:32:20] <%BallerSwagBro9k> MAH BRAND LUL
[0:32:21] <%SMuffinMan> @thecheesewilly because why not?
[0:32:22] <MatchStickMelee> I like your avatar Paige!
[0:32:22] <+AntithesisEK> seems ideal for your comfort
[0:32:23] <$NitronStreams> vtubers are way more than just a trend
[0:32:25] <%g0atmeal> i would feel more comfortable as a v-tuber than being physically on camera 100% of the time, maybe it's just me
[0:32:32] <+WutangchickeN> when are you and Woolies vtuber models gonna fight to the death???
[0:32:33] <+Undenizen> @RLT917 as a non-boob fan I can understand, but I don't care at all

[0:43:17] <%Agami23> you seem to stream more now that you got the vtuber model. i think people should be happy to get more streams than seeing you physically
[0:43:17] <%GabeSweetMan> Paige we've gotten 7 months of normal stream schedule in the past 2 weeks. I couldn't ask for more.
[0:43:22] <peyodogo> dude you shouldnt feel pressured to be on camera, fuck em

[0:43:44] <@Jekado> Paige are you right or left handed?  thats mainly the reason why people decide to default to left or right is their handed ness

[0:58:38] <TheEndlessRiver1> yeah day 1 the angels were....something
[0:58:39] <+realm_forge> It’s ok to have down days. A lot of creative types have up and down mental cycles
[0:58:47] <%nip_nips> i still have nightmares of those angels at launch
[0:58:48] <Treasure_Vault> Someone should tell her about the slug in the previous area she ran by instead of looking at
[0:58:56] <%sporeian94> God I'm drunk off my ass and I'm trying to eat hot wings and I'm getting buffalo sauce all voer my keyboar dfuck
[0:58:59] <%patriotrenegade> They used to do like triple damage
[0:59:01] <DrkJP520> keep rollin rollin rollin rollin

[0:59:13] <Admiral_PopnFresh> Yo nice scythe
[0:59:13] <%athuramn> @sporeian94 that sounds like a delicious time
[0:59:15] <%Monkeyweed21> @ZehJoJo they used to have perfect accuracy, more damage, and would fire 3x faster
[0:59:17] <shotgang86> I forgot what happens in this game if you are cursed
[0:59:21] <SilverFaustX> why are u typing and not cleaning
[0:59:23] <%patriotrenegade> Die

[0:59:32] <Aydarkzero> unnerfed Angels at ng+7 was an experience let me tell you elaSuffer
[0:59:33] <%sporeian94> don't tell me what to do
[0:59:35] <%freelancebabymaker> curse is automatic death iirc

[0:59:45] <@PatStaresAt> @PeachSaliva Hey I notice you like that ice beam attack but it barely does any damage and takes forever
[0:59:50] <+BeatBoxersDevMike> good ol mashed paigetatoes
[0:59:52] <%AncelDeLambert> don't bother with the ice field, it's more for enemies with shields
[0:59:53] <SilverFaustX> HahaPoint
[0:59:57] <M0untain_wolf> thick boi need a big stick
[0:59:57] <%Dakuu75> DAMN BOI~! HE THICC~! THAT'S A THICC-ASS-BOI~!

[1:00:08] <%Bane_Kaikyo> it bumgas your unga
[1:00:08] <%patriotrenegade> Ice beam is only good for inflicting frost
[1:00:08] <TheZearGuy> I haven’t played in a long time but I thought the blunt damage of her mace was better for most enemies. I’m probably wrong though.
[1:00:10] <@PatStaresAt> @PeachSaliva You can call btw if u wan
[1:00:12] <%Chichen> paige, you CAN go back to unga bunga
[1:00:16] <%Captainahab_37> why are angels dicks
[1:00:16] <legion0047> You can, you just need to actually swing
[1:00:20] <xFayt1> does she know about scythe sweetspot or dont care?
[1:00:22] <%nip_nips> call pat (a stinky man)
[1:00:22] <BigYanno> why did you switch off the bunga?
[1:00:22] <%AncelDeLambert> ice field is REALLY good for popping a jerk that hides behind his shield constantly

[1:00:25] <%hewlettfan96> How far into the game are you Peach??
[1:00:28] <%AncelDeLambert> other than that, it's just for poking
[1:00:30] <legion0047> The magic stance is for when you want to get fancy
[1:00:31] <%sporeian94> That sounds like me right now
[1:00:32] <%Dakuu75> (I hate those grudge-sounds.)

[1:04:45] <Dopamien> less mods more bttv emotes 😡
[1:04:47] <VritraReiRei> Vtuber Mods Kappa
[1:04:56] <%Dakuu75> I loved that. Ppl jsut buying mod-status from Pat. But, with the promise that "if you're a piece of shit, you'll jsut be un-modded, thanks for the money."
[1:05:02] <$SirGO0SE> Pat has so many mods now he needs mods for his mods
[1:05:03] <%nip_nips> JESUS CANT HELP YOU NOW
[1:05:05] <benjiFG> this is a long ranged weapon
[1:05:08] <+SilverDevilfish> I love that Robot Kappa
[1:05:13] <%Monkeyweed21> the poison cave is where Lapp got that Titanite Slab he gave you

[1:05:19] <shotgang86> hmmmm
[1:05:20] <%ComfortableStranger> I'd ask to be a mod, but it sounds like a lot of work
[1:05:22] <%nip_nips> the sharp bit is on the END of the scythe
[1:05:22] <%sporeian94> lol
[1:05:23] <Treasure_Vault> The actual blade part does more damage
[1:05:27] <SovPho> she loves to give her enemies a big ol MWAH before slaying them
[1:05:28] <%freelancebabymaker> it just wont work lol
[1:05:29] <SovPho> like a praying mantis
[1:05:31] <%Captainahab_37> the part with the blade works really well yeah
[1:05:32] <+RandyFistburgers> One of its benefits is its range
[1:05:32] <legion0047> The skythe actually have a sweetspot
[1:05:34] <Ravioli_Ronin> Social-distance face-fucking
[1:05:38] <+Scevda> Smother them in your bosom
[1:05:48] <%freelancebabymaker> paige you keep doing that
[1:05:48] <%nip_nips> range is no advantage when she facefucks everything

[1:06:37] <MiamiMemory> Ah fuck
[1:06:39] <xFayt1> with scythes, iirc, some enemies will just straight up miss since the hitbox starts at your hands
[1:06:45] <%BlackStarAura> How can this be
[1:06:50] <+NWR_James> NWR_James subscribed with Prime. They've subscribed for 49 months! 49 months is a few months. I've actually run out of month jokes at this point
[1:06:50] <%Captainahab_37> it's like STALKER
[1:06:50] <peachy996> run around the area and look for slugs
[1:06:54] <%KeiganOfAstora> Roll has i-frames, running does not
[1:06:57] <benjiFG> aren't we all fleshbeasts
[1:06:59] <%freelancebabymaker> kill slug
[1:06:59] <%nip_nips> pat is a flesh beast

[1:08:03] <%GabeSweetMan> Drink that sunny-d
[1:08:06] <MiamiMemory> KEEP ROLLIN, ROLLIN, ROLLIN

[1:08:12] <%freelancebabymaker> you have estus paige
[1:08:13] <+FoolsArcade> don't roll just sprint
[1:08:16] <Treasure_Vault> Find it
[1:08:17] <Ravioli_Ronin> SERPENTINE SERPENTINE OhMyDog
[1:08:19] <%CollinsOfBodom> I found sprinting to generally work better than rolling
[1:08:22] <%patriotrenegade> Do you want us to just tell you
[1:08:24] <%freelancebabymaker> isnt this angels host really hard to find?
[1:08:26] <BigYanno> this is the typical experience for this area
[1:08:28] <$Sphincter_Spelunker> You should pray harder to angels
[1:08:29] <%patriotrenegade> Because you can get rid of the angel
[1:08:30] <%Fooguwu> These Angels did 2x damage when the DLC first came out btw @PeachSaliva you got it easy
[1:08:31] <%AncelDeLambert> Pat, these angels are a NIGHTMARE to find, and you know it
[1:08:38] <%patriotrenegade> I know where it is
[1:08:39] <UlriktheSlayer1> my flesh beast is in my pants :)
[1:08:41] <Treasure_Vault> Uhh, this ain't where the angel is i think
[1:08:43] <BigYanno> but the flesh beast isn't there pat
[1:08:45] <syd_fishes> i think i just summoned someone to show me the path 😂
[1:08:51] <Treasure_Vault> She gotta advance
[1:08:51] <Aydarkzero> Goblin Squad monkaS
[1:08:57] <%AncelDeLambert> like, the one in the poison pool is on a roof you need to climb a different vine, and then drop from a roof, and then drop to ANOTHER roof to find
[1:08:58] <+rafaelba93> why no hide
[1:09:00] <%freelancebabymaker> nice
[1:09:01] <%GabeSweetMan> Drink
[1:09:02] <SilverFaustX> lol
[1:09:05] <Hydrapissed> LOL
[1:09:05] <%nip_nips> HOW CAN THIS BE
[1:09:06] <%GabeSweetMan> Drinking can help
[1:09:08] <%freelancebabymaker> HEAL
[1:09:11] <%Captainahab_37> by killing the gross flesh thing
[1:09:11] <Dopamien> calebKek

[1:09:23] <+Thesaltt> Uhhh
[1:09:25] <xFayt1> drink through the pain
[1:09:26] <Treasure_Vault> You gotta try drinking before you say you can't
[1:09:27] <MiamiMemory> WE HAVE TO FOIND OUT WHO DID THIS
[1:09:27] <benjiFG> notice how you take no stagger from the lasers
[1:09:27] <%BlackStarAura> BABA
[1:09:30] <%RealThiele> some drink better than no drink
[1:09:37] <%GabeSweetMan> Also, rolling is WAY less effective than just sprinting.
[1:09:39] <%patriotrenegade> HOW COULD PAT DO THIS
[1:09:41] <zhenthrim213> PAAATTTTTUHHHHH
[1:09:44] <BlackIronClam> The hits won't stagger so it's all good
[1:09:49] <+Romuken> been so long, I've forgotten

[1:09:51] <xFayt1> below
[1:09:54] <%freelancebabymaker> drink until you figure your problems out
[1:09:56] <%GabeSweetMan> Stop rolling and sprint instead.
[1:09:57] <%nip_nips> pats looking it up because he forgot where it actually is
[1:09:59] <benjiFG> you gotta go up the trees to find him
[1:10:01] <%hewlettfan96> Paaaaatuuuuh

[1:47:19] <%patriotrenegade> great first try!
[1:47:20] <EuropanLamprey> So remember when the last of the demons were exterminated twice before?
[1:47:21] <BigYanno> At least the runback is 2 seconds long
[1:47:21] <danknugglit> So close
[1:47:22] <Coystick> Good first try
[1:47:23] <%freelancebabymaker> @peachsaliva two of them
[1:47:23] <%Sotetsu> Great first try!
[1:47:25] <%Supermonaman> Good try though.
[1:47:27] <+RickyJZ> That was a really good first attempt.
[1:47:27] <%RealThiele> 25% left p.good
[1:47:28] <%GabeSweetMan> As always, damn good first attempt.
[1:47:29] <%Epic_Fubar> pretty solid run
[1:47:31] <%Grimlockfly> same
[1:47:36] <+MisterAvry> relatable
[1:47:37] <%patriotrenegade> same
[1:47:37] <%CzeekyTV> mood
[1:47:39] <+rafaelba93> we are all
[1:47:40] <%freelancebabymaker> scary jessica nigri? you mean jenna lynn meowri
[1:47:44] <Dave_VD> Yeah she is Kreygasm
[1:47:45] <+mechslayer71> oh goodness this boss fight
[1:47:45] <danknugglit> Shes so hot
[1:47:46] <BigFingerRo> POINT DOWN META
[1:47:46] <+RowenCleric> yea me too Paige me too
[1:47:47] <+Scevda> Why is paige so good at boss first trys jeebus
[1:47:48] <%Monkeyweed21> @PeachSaliva the gimmick is that one of them will be fiery and fight you up close while the other hangs back and shoots stuff, focus on the fiery one
[1:47:49] <@commanderclaw> Please learn to run, it is useful
[1:47:51] <%waltzqueen> Is being scared why you kill all the women?
[1:47:52] <@PlagueOfGripes> peace fears the beast within
[1:47:55] <Tyonidus> It's completely irrational to be scared of them now, you're completely off the market ya dingus!
[1:47:56] <%RealThiele> : O
[1:47:59] <Badgerconda_> this is how Paige escaped the coffee girl, she rolled all the way out of the store
[1:48:03] <%GabeSweetMan> Run from the boss like you run from hot women!
[1:48:04] <%freelancebabymaker> shes also SO HOT
[1:48:07] <+ratchetex> I just fear talking to anyone
[1:48:10] <Srthunda> you can do that now
[1:48:10] <Madinki> She's so hot.....not the best VA though Kappa
[1:48:17] <Coystick> No it's on Dark Soul 3, rollspam is incentivised and aweful
[1:48:19] <eyeobject> I would absolutely run away from Meowri
[1:48:20] <BigYanno> they're more agressive when on fire, as most things would be
[1:48:22] <%Agami23> a way that might help could be vrchat paige.
[1:48:24] <%sporeian94> What if Paige meet GArrus' VA
[1:48:25] <%hewlettfan96> Really
[1:48:29] <benjiFG> you're one handing your weapon
[1:48:30] <+fetrigon> and paige is a beta nerd
[1:48:35] <%hewlettfan96> Who does she voice??
[1:48:37] <%patriotrenegade> @PeachSaliva If both are aggro and flailing at you, just run away from them dont attack them
[1:48:37] <+fetrigon> B E T A
[1:48:37] <%brokendarktower> good luck
[1:48:43] <+fetrigon> LUL
[1:48:44] <%freelancebabymaker> fear the women. fear what you will DO TO THEM
[1:48:46] <%Captainahab_37> you did run from a girl
[1:48:47] <%AncelDeLambert> @PeachSaliva the best advice is to focus one of them
[1:48:48] <danknugglit> LUL
[1:48:49] <%JenovasPuppet> I find my aggression usually goes down when I'm on fire.
[1:48:51] <%Monkeyweed21> the one not on fire will run away and shoot shit at you
[1:48:57] <+fetrigon> s'all gud
[1:48:57] <krabthecrab> Beta Paige vs. Sigma Coffee Girl
[1:49:00] <%Teintstein> beta + nerd = berd
[1:49:01] <Treasure_Vault> Paige is sigma as fuck. too busy running to flirt with hot coffee babe
[1:49:03] <Madinki> @hewlettfan96 One of the evil chicks in RWBY. It's not great
[1:49:07] <%freelancebabymaker> ope
[1:49:07] <Redmannasah> hmm
[1:49:10] <%JenovasPuppet> LET THE ROLLING COMMENCE!
[1:49:10] <zhenthrim213> good run
[1:49:12] <%patriotrenegade> Theyre at their most dangerous when they;re both on fire
[1:49:12] <BigFingerRo> seconds
[1:49:13] <Dr_Mooose> warmup round
[1:49:14] <%Grimlockfly> ask Gael for help
[1:49:20] <$Sphincter_Spelunker> @Madinki that sounds par for the course for RWBY
[1:49:20] <Coystick> She has no mouth and she must roll
[1:49:20] <@PlagueOfGripes> one demon is in pain, the other is coming in from below. wonder why it's in pain
[1:49:21] <churropoppa> Sigma frame
[1:49:23] <+mechslayer71> keep rolling KEKW
[1:49:23] <EuropanLamprey> Time for Flaccid Pancake
[1:49:24] <%Grimlockfly> hell yea coffee babe
[1:49:24] <IrishWeegee> keep rollin rollin rollin dont stop
[1:49:25] <+Axellogic> Roll when they attack not when they just exist :V
[1:49:25] <jbrachob> why no summons?
[1:49:25] <BigYanno> so the one that's not on fire doesn't need to be watched as hard
[1:49:27] <MiamiMemory> ENTER THE MANOSPHERE
[1:49:27] <%patriotrenegade> Is she French
[1:49:27] <+rafaelba93> keep em both in your vision
[1:49:28] <%freelancebabymaker> is she franch
[1:49:37] <%Agami23> imagine if she somehow found the stream
[1:49:37] <BigYanno> may as well
[1:49:39] <%patriotrenegade> no u got this
[1:49:39] <%WutangchickeN> fiancee ship ended with Pat, coffee babe is new best fiancee
[1:49:40] <%Captainahab_37> you should slide her a note and on it is your twitch link
[1:49:40] <%ospreyworks> good to see ya tonight, Paige. stuck working on work shit because I lost time on Friday due to laptop malfunctioning shenanigans
[1:49:40] <SulfurousAcid> do a big summon
[1:49:40] <%That1blindkid> what are the odds she is in the chat right now? Kappa
[1:49:41] <%freelancebabymaker> yeah why not
[1:49:41] <%conchthechimera> Does she remind you of the babe?
[1:49:41] <BigYanno> no reason not to
[1:49:43] <%Monkeyweed21> you can summon yes
[1:49:45] <%Dirty_Dandere> -Gale or LAPP
[1:49:47] <%Captainahab_37> so she's like "w-what?"
[1:49:48] <Madinki> @Sphincter_Spelunker Yeah but Jessica especially is not great
[1:49:49] <CrimsonFox777> Pickled Pat
[1:49:53] <BigYanno> There is no shame in summoning
[1:49:53] <%hewlettfan96> I’ve just looked at her yeah ur right
[1:49:55] <SulfurousAcid> do a BIG summon do it
[1:49:57] <%Grimlockfly> yeaaah Gael and Lapp will help you
[1:49:58] <+MisterAvry> if she were a president, would she be Babe-raham Lincoln?
[1:49:58] <BigYanno> gotta ember
[1:49:58] <+Axellogic> Summons are of power
[1:49:58] <%AncelDeLambert> you're eating pickled ginger STRAIGHT?!
[1:49:59] <%Grimlockfly> ember
[1:49:59] <%freelancebabymaker> ember
[1:50:00] <%graemecrackers2> Pickled Pat?
[1:50:01] <%GabeSweetMan> Paige, run from the boss instead of rolling. Just imagine they're a hot girl.
[1:50:01] <sirrice77> Lapp is best for this because tanky
[1:50:01] <%JenovasPuppet> Ember up
[1:50:02] <SulfurousAcid> ember up
[1:50:03] <%patriotrenegade> yeah if ur a coward
[1:50:06] <luftraumm1> if she's anything like the kinds of women that flock around pige she's a BABE
[1:50:07] <+fetrigon> I could go for some pickled ginger rn majinoWeebey
[1:50:08] <Tyonidus> Hot women don't scare me, they just make me super depressed because they will never find me attractive.
[1:50:08] <%AncelDeLambert> he's at the back behind the bonfire
[1:50:10] <+Axellogic> Ember by bonfire
[1:50:11] <%Dirty_Dandere> BY BONFIRE
[1:50:14] <%patriotrenegade> youve only attempted twice
[1:50:14] <EuropanLamprey> May as well, this boss is a slog
[1:50:15] <%Captainahab_37> pickled ginger is fuckin delicious okay
[1:50:17] <+redreymar> you 100% do not need a summon you almost first tried the two
[1:50:21] <RushUnplugged> summon THE BOYS
[1:50:23] <TheEndlessRiver1> only friede is free, because she is ridiculous
[1:50:27] <%freelancebabymaker> gael being summonable during friede was a special thing
[1:50:28] <+Mekhet09> wait a bit.
[1:50:28] <CrimsonFox777> That message is a lie. You WILL die though.
[1:50:32] <%GabeSweetMan> She's only tried twice but why not.
[1:50:33] <%JenovasPuppet> Totally valid
[1:50:34] <SulfurousAcid> how dare you call paige a pickled ginger
[1:50:34] <%freelancebabymaker> thats probably good honestly
[1:50:37] <+twohitgood> lapp is good.
[1:50:39] <MiamiMemory> @PeachSaliva  What is your favorite pickled food?

[1:57:49] <Magicferret> This isn't the laser version right?
[1:57:51] <SulfurousAcid> *beating
[1:57:51] <Redmannasah> Hmm, doesnt the other one have different attacks or somethin if you fight him instead?
[1:57:53] <%AVkid_> "Satan! You owe me!"
[1:57:58] <%JenovasPuppet> This situation calls for more rolling and more ice attacks!
[1:58:00] <%That1blindkid> bosses have too much health in this dlc
[1:58:00] <DracaenaLeaf> bitrate boss lol
[1:58:01] <$SinisterBroccoli> summoning makes the boss tougher

[1:59:24] <BigFingerRo> OH GOD TIME TO SHIT
[1:59:25] <%GabeSweetMan> So Paige.... you might wanna heal more often.
[1:59:25] <+mechslayer71> knew she wasn't gonna look up a second time
[1:59:25] <%MarylandJutsu> METOER
[1:59:25] <zhenthrim213> summon METEOR
[1:59:25] <BigYanno> Good fight
[1:59:26] <%freelancebabymaker> that was a good one tho
[1:59:26] <%SophiaAmoreaVeritas> Good second go
[1:59:28] <+FoolsArcade> when he breathe the fire you gotta hit
[1:59:29] <Dunmarkh> @PlagueOfGripes are you talking about the demon or paige's rolling?
[1:59:29] <TheEndlessRiver1> paige remember you can look up to see what his fire breath attack does
[1:59:30] <peyodogo> @peyodogo yeaahh but with paige it's always seemed to be about comfort, vibes and morale, and the scythe is fuckin with that something fierce lol
[1:59:31] <%AVkid_> aw crap indeed lol
[1:59:31] <Artista_AF> zoneFlash
[1:59:31] <DianaTheAscian> I remember this boss fight being a lot faster
[1:59:32] <%FacetiousAF> fuck 'em up SwiftRage
[1:59:32] <%hewlettfan96> METEOR
[1:59:32] <$NitronStreams> got him down to 30% tho
[1:59:33] <Madinki> You're doing GREAT sweetie Kappa
[1:59:34] <BurdRightsActivist> BAD AT GAME KEKW
[1:59:34] <%Dirty_Dandere> Lapp STRONG
[1:59:34] <Coystick> Paige you gotta pay attention to what he's doing and not just his ass
[1:59:35] <%Sotetsu> shigiClap
[1:59:35] <%patriotrenegade> Bosses get more HP when you have summons
[1:59:37] <%SveriSageAdvice> the moment you ran in to attack while he was summoning a meteor, i knew death was imminent lol
[1:59:37] <+MisterAvry> he takes a LOT of damage yo
[1:59:38] <Redmannasah> Yeah, double summon makes that second phase a bitch
[1:59:38] <BigFingerRo> BROWN WAR 2 STARTINF
[1:59:38] <%FacetiousAF> BIG AND MIGHTY
[1:59:39] <+JohnRMo> thorwSlain thorwSlain
[1:59:41] <%geekjacob> that was super good
[1:59:42] <MiamiMemory> You tried and that's what matters
[1:59:43] <+Axellogic> You do have like 54 more embers
[1:59:44] <%That1blindkid> If you get the other demon to be last then the 2nd phase has an easier moveset
[1:59:48] <$SinisterBroccoli> DianaTheAscian summoning gives them omore health
[1:59:50] <Treasure_Vault> @PeachSaliva Press drink twice and you'll drink twice. Helps sometimes.
[1:59:52] <%TheWinged7> you mean hammer?
[1:59:52] <$SinisterBroccoli> sword?
[1:59:52] <%Agami23> the sword???
[1:59:52] <Dunmarkh> the sword?
[1:59:54] <albret__einstrong> believe summons are a mistake with demon prince, he alrady has way too much health
[1:59:55] <$Sphincter_Spelunker> what sword?..
[1:59:56] <%Puhff> Maybe time for Hammer again
[1:59:56] <benjiFG> to look cool
[1:59:57] <%GabeSweetMan> Flair
[1:59:58] <peachy996> It was a Hammer
[1:59:58] <%geekjacob> the sword?
[1:59:58] <Dr_Mooose> looks cool
[1:59:58] <+OldDarkwraith> Switch back to the hammer then, it's sorta impractical to switch to a completely different play style This far in on your first playthrough. And in the hardest area no less
[1:59:59] <+mechslayer71> look up when he does the big fire breath charge into the air
[1:59:59] <%hewlettfan96> hewlettfan96 subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 5 months, currently on a 2 month streak! THis game giving you grief paige
[2:00:00] <SulfurousAcid> no
[2:00:00] <%CptCreampuff16> the FUG?
[2:00:00] <Redmannasah> It looks cool
[2:00:02] <$SinisterBroccoli> it's good for little dudes
[2:00:04] <+MisterAvry> it looks neato
[2:00:04] <%Draylle> i think she should switch to the Mace
[2:00:05] <%KeiganOfAstora> Just keep using ember and using NPC summons
[2:00:06] <zhenthrim213> pvp
[2:00:06] <%CosmicInfinity> then switch?
[2:00:07] <+zamatermort> NO
[2:00:07] <%patriotrenegade> no
[2:00:10] <+FoolsArcade> It doesn't suck, its just not for bosses
[2:00:13] <%g0atmeal> summons make boss harder
[2:00:17] <CandyCoatedConfection> she should switch back to the mace probably
[2:00:18] <devanmuse> Maybe going back to what you're most comfortable with is for the best
[2:00:18] <Redmannasah> Style over everything
[2:00:20] <%KeiganOfAstora> It's not for bosses
[2:00:22] <HawkHollywood> doesn't he get a laser beam instead if you kill demon in pain first
[2:00:22] <%JenovasPuppet> Mace would probably be good for this, right? Ice attack against fire demons?
[2:00:22] <BigFingerRo> HAMMOR WAS CARRYING CONFIRMED
[2:00:23] <DianaTheAscian> @SinisterBroccoli no I mean the boss moves slower than I remember
[2:00:23] <$Sphincter_Spelunker> but she wasn't used to it
[2:00:23] <peyodogo> dude go back to hammer, you're clearly uncomfortable with this
[2:00:26] <Madinki> YOU PICKED IT BECAUSE IT LOOKS COOL THAT'S WHY
[2:00:26] <%Dirty_Dandere> You have 2 summons so the Boss has SO MUCH HEALTH
[2:00:32] <gnarly_memes_bro> it's good for people sized enemies
[2:00:33] <%arcaderabbit48> @JenovasPuppet Scythe is also ice
[2:00:35] <+JusTTheGuyYouNeed> that attack can stunlock pretty much everything
[2:00:35] <%Agami23> the double scythe is for human enemies
[2:00:40] <%Draylle> Paige seems more comfortable with the mace
[2:00:41] <xFayt1> the second scythe also scales with int, iirc
[2:00:44] <%superc37> 1. it doesnt its just not good for THIS SITUATION and 2.  its mostly for pvp
[2:00:53] <Faustgesicht> trading unga for dps

[2:02:07] <peyodogo> honestly paige would do great with the bkgs, anything but a dex weapon. number don't matter as much as comfort
[2:02:08] <+ghostfaceninja_> face fucking... I'm talking about face fucking
[2:02:13] <EuropanLamprey> The magic damage only applies on the weapon Art, without the weapon art, only the physical damage counts
[2:02:15] <danknugglit> That scythe fucks
[2:02:30] <%AVkid_> @ghostfaceninja_  oh dont do that
[2:02:30] <+Scevda> @peyodogo agreed it would mitigate her bad habits
[2:02:30] <benjiFG> this scythe fucked my wife

[2:08:22] <+Mekhet09> just learn how to use the scythe. i feel like you've said it sucks and gave up on it. but hammer in this area with the way you play is the problem.
[2:08:22] <Treasure_Vault> This DLC has literally the best hammer in all of dark souls as well as the best hammer from DS2
[2:08:23] <%Agami23> oh right. that hammer coming up, i forgot that
[2:08:25] <%JoshManVGH> Something with IMPACT
[2:08:28] <EuropanLamprey> @PeachSaliva Pat made a mistake, he thought the Split damage applied to the R1 attacks like every other weapon but the magic damage only applies when you use the WA because this weapon is unique
[2:08:28] <+MisterAvry> I play the same way Paige
[2:08:29] <%Dakuu75> Wet Hammer~
[2:08:30] <%SuckerPunchSyd> Doesn’t feel as meaty

[2:09:36] <+MisterAvry> I got a PS5 controller and it's been nice
[2:09:37] <+doc_ock_rokc> @Treasure_Vault I already do
[2:09:39] <%Agami23> ps5 dualsense controller is very good for pc
[2:09:44] <peyodogo> lets gooooo unga bunga
[2:09:49] <Jetsfantasy> Honestly a regular ol' xbox one controller is good
[2:09:50] <%g0atmeal> does she have another tongue?
[2:09:50] <Treasure_Vault> @doc_ock_rokc So we can be sad together
[2:09:54] <benjiFG> does she have enough tongues
[2:09:55] <IrishWeegee> xbox 360 wired controller is cheap and universal
[2:09:55] <+FoolsArcade> Does Paige even have another Tongue?
[2:09:56] <AthenaAegis> 8bitdo SN30 Pro Plus is my pick
[2:09:58] <@MistyMntns> Wow I have good timing lolol
[2:10:01] <hitaker> are we respeccing?
[2:10:03] <+doc_ock_rokc> @Treasure_Vault ITS GOOD FOR MONSTER HUNTER
[2:10:06] <%SMuffinMan> Have hammer will travel
[2:10:07] <Lancaster_H> try tongue
[2:10:10] <%SophiaAmoreaVeritas> @FoolsArcade I think so

[2:10:13] <+Scevda> Bed chamber hot
[2:10:14] <Piemono> Pat will Face Jack the stream
[2:10:14] <%Grimlockfly> @doc_ock_rokc do you like a Playstation or Xbox controller?
[2:10:17] <$Sphincter_Spelunker> don't PS controllers only work with Steam? otherwise you need DS4windows
[2:10:20] <+FoolsArcade> lots of tongues!
[2:10:29] <+RowenCleric> if Pat steps too close does the vtuber become some Akira monster fleshbeast
[2:10:29] <Treasure_Vault> @doc_ock_rokc It's good for anything, eventually, if you really work at the setup
[2:10:33] <peachy996> Pats voice coming out of Paige's avatar is delightfully cursed
[2:10:39] <peachy996> do it
[2:10:40] <eyeobject> good jorb
[2:10:43] <%KeiganOfAstora> @PatStaresAt After changing stats while still in the Covenant menu, force quit the game. Load the game back up and you don't lose a Pale Tongue
[2:10:44] <+Scevda> @rowencleric that would be awesome
[2:10:45] <Treasure_Vault> But strangely, other controllers just work when you plug them in
[2:10:49] <jetpack_rorschasch> ALMOST
[2:10:51] <+doc_ock_rokc> @Grimlockfly I had a Xbox controler for a while but it died because it was the cheap, and my ps3 controler died a few months ago
[2:10:52] <%MarylandJutsu> but she doesn't show the marriage titty

[2:12:18] <EuropanLamprey> She's wearing Prisoners Chain so she gets 5 End so 35 would be better
[2:12:18] <jetpack_rorschasch> 60
[2:12:20] <RushUnplugged> but 66 str means MAX DAMAGE
[2:12:22] <%SveriSageAdvice> it diminishes after 40, so maybe put the 7 into something else you want?
[2:12:22] <Treasure_Vault> Go 60 for big damage, and one handed attacks are useful with it
[2:12:22] <peyodogo> looks good, just put the levels you get into str
[2:12:24] <%KeiganOfAstora> Too much Vigor but this is Paige so....
[2:12:24] <MiamiMemory> @zeraux_  I remember Rick getting helicoptered out of the show? That happened right?
[2:12:25] <xFayt1> 2 handing gives you 1.5x strength for requirements
[2:12:26] <+Scevda> 42 on STr
[2:12:27] <%g0atmeal> You need HP, seriously
[2:12:27] <sosuke5> 50 st
[2:12:31] <Treasure_Vault> Pat is right
[2:12:32] <@commanderclaw> 40 Vig and the rest into STR
[2:12:33] <+Scevda> 42 is the answer
[2:12:35] <%JenovasPuppet> Pat love big health
[2:12:36] <SulfurousAcid> Why no luck?? Kappa
[2:12:36] <peachy996> paige cant dodge, she roll
[2:12:37] <%KeiganOfAstora> This is Paige so....
[2:12:39] <%Grimlockfly> Paige you need all the health
[2:12:40] <$Sphincter_Spelunker> soft cap at 40
[2:12:41] <SGrim> It's fine
[2:12:46] <hitaker> yeah i agree with claw
[2:12:47] <Lancaster_H> if you put Faith up to 20 jesus will help you when you call out his name
[2:12:47] <Tracazoid> Paige doesn't need survivability, she needs power!
[2:12:48] <+Inferno_Icon> 42 str 45 vig
[2:12:48] <$Sphincter_Spelunker> more strength
[2:12:48] <%Monkeyweed21> @PeachSaliva 40 vig is the soft cap
[2:12:49] <%sporeian94> DUMP IT ALL INTO LUCK
[2:12:50] <%Grimlockfly> Guys, Paige needs all the health
[2:12:52] <sosuke5> vit ups defense, doesn't it
[2:12:52] <BigYanno> i mean I would put some into vitality to wear more clothes
[2:12:52] <+blademaster247> Do you want big health or big damage
[2:12:53] <%g0atmeal> Vig soft cap is 50, not 40
[2:12:55] <%KeiganOfAstora> Vigor has no cap
[2:12:55] <%AncelDeLambert> it's just health, whatever
[2:12:56] <+Scevda> Never not enough vit
[2:13:00] <%JenovasPuppet> Perfect!
[2:13:01] <%KeiganOfAstora> It's 50 not 40
[2:13:03] <EuropanLamprey> 35 + Chain = 40 meaning 10 more strength
[2:13:06] <%AncelDeLambert> 50
[2:13:11] <%KeiganOfAstora> Hard cap
[2:13:12] <peachy996> STATS
[2:13:13] <+Scevda> 45 and 42 !
[2:13:16] <sosuke5> vit though
[2:13:17] <eyeobject> but number
[2:13:18] <%freelancebabymaker> the pat is going to melt
[2:13:19] <Treasure_Vault> This is all fine, you can respec and this all still works
[2:13:19] <infinityk11> LOOOOOl
[2:13:20] <%JenovasPuppet> You don't need 47 VIG lol
[2:13:21] <+Scevda> Nice numbers
[2:13:21] <%AVkid_> just whatever pat says, dude looks like he was born in DS
[2:13:24] <shaddydaddyo> lawd
[2:13:25] <jetpack_rorschasch> 50
[2:13:25] <infinityk11> so confusing
[2:13:29] <%KeiganOfAstora> She kinda does need all that VIG lol
[2:13:29] <Treasure_Vault> Pat will just cheat you more tongues
[2:13:30] <danknugglit> Just do what makes you comfortable
[2:13:30] <%SMuffinMan> LMAO
[2:13:30] <+Ches_Neckbeard> PAT-AH CHAT-AH
[2:13:32] <jetpack_rorschasch> GO TO 50
[2:13:33] <+cvp5127> paige you can cheat
[2:13:33] <sosuke5> dump in Vit
[2:13:34] <IrishWeegee> @peachsaliva how often do you block? 60 to one hand the hammer and be able to block
[2:13:34] <%freelancebabymaker> you can always get MORE LEVELS
[2:13:35] <hitaker> whatever happens everything will be OK
[2:13:35] <+Ne1son> 47 Vig is way much
[2:13:39] <%Monkeyweed21> BIG STRONG
[2:13:40] <%AncelDeLambert> Paige, you're ALMOST done with the game, it's fine
[2:13:41] <+Mekhet09> it's not going to matter with your playstyle you're going to have to play safer.
[2:13:43] <%KeiganOfAstora> @PeachSaliva There's a glitch so you don't waste any tongues
[2:13:44] <xFayt1> there is a way to avoid the tongue cost and limited count
[2:13:47] <scrumbotime> BIGGEST WOMAN
[2:13:48] <@commanderclaw> Now your health bar is turgid and erect
[2:13:52] <%Agami23> paige everyone is gonna be wrong.
[2:13:54] <xFayt1> but not sure how that stands here
[2:13:56] <%femto216> Tongue but Hole
[2:14:00] <peachy996> what a fantastic system
[2:14:04] <+ghostfaceninja_> yeah you can farm more tongues but isnt there a cap on how many times you can respec?
[2:14:06] <%KeiganOfAstora> Take the torch off
[2:14:12] <+Scevda> Hammer acquired
[2:14:13] <peachy996> totally not stupid at all
[2:14:16] <%superc37> @danknugglit nothing makes her comfortable, thats why we're doin this
[2:14:17] <$Sphincter_Spelunker> dancer
[2:14:19] <Treasure_Vault> One handed ledo hammer swings are useful for their speed relative to two handed.
[2:14:26] <xFayt1> there is a way around the max count
[2:14:28] <sirrice77> @ghostfaceninja_ there is a respec cap yes, there is a glitch for unlimited respec though
[2:14:33] <@commanderclaw> Always double fist your hammer
[2:14:34] <%ItsRatman> Back to unga

[2:18:28] <%freelancebabymaker> i forgot the fox had glasses
[2:18:31] <VritraReiRei> When she did the Respec did she also reset some of her IRL Specs as well? LUL
[2:18:38] <Zooperton> that is some big hp
[2:18:38] <%MarylandJutsu> shes gonna roll like crazy
[2:18:43] <$Sphincter_Spelunker> glasses without lenses atpCap
[2:18:46] <%Draylle> look at she go
[2:18:46] <+Scevda> the glasses make her twice as good imo
[2:18:59] <peachy996> In for a long haul
[2:19:02] <+Mekhet09> you do less damage. and you're getting hit more.
[2:19:03] <Treasure_Vault> Hammer rhythms are simpler. Easier to find when to roll.
[2:19:14] <%RealThiele> CONFIDENCE GO UP
[2:19:16] <%JoshManVGH> Paige has come home. To hammer!
[2:19:22] <$hrbeck_> As a hobby optometrist, I diagnose you with Dead/20 vision

[2:19:44] <%Draylle> unga bunga is her element
[2:19:46] <sirrice77> @MiamiMemory whip
[2:19:53] <%abittershark> PAIGE SMASH
[2:19:56] <%KeiganOfAstora> HIT THEM
[2:20:01] <%Monkeyweed21> the scythe does more damage but Paige's brain is unable to handle anything but big and heavy weapon so it does worse
[2:20:06] <Treasure_Vault> Seeing her go to the tail for the riposte triggers something in me
[2:20:07] <$Sphincter_Spelunker> @MiamiMemory fist weapons
[2:20:08] <%JenovasPuppet> Fight me closer, Hammer dancer
[2:20:09] <infinityk11> smash his knees

[2:21:05] <thepalevampyr> Demon prince WutFace
[2:21:10] <%freelancebabymaker> there was a big fire demon monster cut from bloodborne
[2:21:11] <peachy996> stop trying to connect the dots pat
[2:21:15] <benjiFG> getting a lot of bloodborne vibes from this...
[2:21:20] <%JenovasPuppet> Man who has only played Bloodborne: "Getting a lot of Bloodborne vibes"
[2:21:23] <%freelancebabymaker> maybe that got reworked a bit
[2:21:24] <infinityk11> my God
[2:21:24] <BigFingerRo> If she dies with hammor AND 2 summons, I'm gonna shit again
[2:21:25] <%KeiganOfAstora> Has anyone beaten this boss solo? Be honest
[2:21:25] <DoostCola> free pat
[2:21:29] <Treasure_Vault> Getting some real boss baby 2 vibes from this fight
[2:21:34] <TheEndlessRiver1> @KeiganOfAstora yeah

[2:22:09] <%JenovasPuppet> They see her rollin
[2:22:17] <infinityk11> Balls on the inside
[2:22:18] <Treasure_Vault> One day she will double chug. The secret technique
[2:22:24] <+ghostfaceninja_> they hatin
[2:22:29] <%Draylle> did she just whiff all 3 swings?
[2:22:29] <Treasure_Vault> Handed down from alcoholic to alcoholic
[2:22:31] <MamokZalku> The Demon formerly known as Prince
[2:22:32] <Jaysky> I hate how much of an hp sink this fucker is
[2:22:33] <+Axellogic> Watch this woman whiff
[2:22:34] <%KeiganOfAstora> @infinityk11 of the ass
[2:22:35] <Dunmarkh> 3 whiff combo
[2:22:38] <%GabeSweetMan> Oof. Bad place to stand.
[2:22:43] <%JenovasPuppet> @MamokZalku LUL
[2:22:44] <TheEndlessRiver1> it doesnt help she has two summons to
[2:23:00] <infinityk11> GO FOR THE KNEES
[2:23:07] <%KeiganOfAstora> Heal, might as well
[2:23:12] <MiamiMemory> @TheEndlessRiver1  How much HP I added to the boss per summon? Is that how it works?
[2:23:19] <%arcaderabbit48> Also cause this boss has a lot of HP to begin with
[2:23:22] <eyeobject> this really ungas my bungas
[2:23:23] <%Sotetsu> Noooo
[2:23:24] <%Draylle> you did better tho
[2:23:26] <%KeiganOfAstora> Even with all her HP
[2:23:26] <+FoolsArcade> don't put yourself up against the wall
[2:23:28] <%JenovasPuppet> One more try!
[2:23:30] <BigFingerRo> OH FUCK IT'S TIME TO SHIT TWICE
[2:23:31] <Treasure_Vault> Try one summon?
[2:23:31] <sosuke5> same mistake
[2:23:31] <%SveriSageAdvice> i think its like 50% per NPC
[2:23:31] <peachy996> She's more comfortable with hammer than scythe tho
[2:23:35] <BigFingerRo> I CANNOT BELIEVE IT
[2:23:35] <%JoshManVGH> That was WAY better though!
[2:23:39] <+Axellogic> The big fire is very telegraphed by a loud dingy noise
[2:23:40] <+blademaster247> If it's any consolation Gale did much better that time
[2:23:42] <%RealThiele> you did great
[2:23:44] <TheEndlessRiver1> @MiamiMemory i dont know exact numbers, but its definitely a good amount
[2:23:44] <+FoolsArcade> you did excellent regardless
[2:23:47] <MamokZalku> the amnesiac formerly known as paige
[2:23:48] <+Scevda> She refused to acknwoledge meteor
[2:23:52] <%BlackStarAura> Confidence
[2:23:56] <+ghostfaceninja_> no need to rush, let the summons draw agro
[2:23:58] <%FacetiousAF> THE GLASSES
[2:23:58] <+Axellogic> Use your eyes to listen
[2:23:59] <BigFingerRo> I HAVE BEGUN BROWN WAR 3
[2:24:00] <Treasure_Vault> With Pat, you have infinite ember
[2:24:00] <TheLocalRival> What’s your favorite ice cream flavor queen @peachsaliva
[2:24:02] <@commanderclaw> But what if you need them later?
[2:24:02] <%KeiganOfAstora> Yea just keep using your embers
[2:24:02] <%JenovasPuppet> That is SO many embers
[2:24:02] <%freelancebabymaker> that is a shitload of embers
[2:24:03] <%KeiganOfAstora> You can buy more
[2:24:06] <jetpack_rorschasch> You were doing more damage with the scythe, but you FEEL better with Hammer.
[2:24:07] <+Axellogic> You have plenty of embers
[2:24:07] <%AVkid_> @bigfingerro. youd be a great sports announcer
[2:24:08] <SulfurousAcid> if she doesn't look at meteor it can't hurt her @Scevda
[2:24:08] <+Scevda> Ya much better comfidence
[2:24:11] <%KeiganOfAstora> Ember up though for HP
[2:24:14] <+Axellogic> Id still ember up
[2:24:15] <danknugglit> Ember anyway
[2:24:16] <%RealThiele> you are swole with embers
[2:24:18] <+Scevda> 99 ether
[2:24:18] <%JenovasPuppet> Ember up for extra health
[2:24:23] <%FacetiousAF> fuck 'em up
[2:24:24] <%KeiganOfAstora> Ember for more HP tho, you have plenty
[2:24:24] <%arcaderabbit48> Ember up
[2:24:24] <xFayt1> you can use ember as full heal
[2:24:27] <%SophiaAmoreaVeritas> College try
[2:24:31] <%CollinsOfBodom> IT Pat slowly rising up
[2:24:31] <infinityk11> BIG HUGE
[2:24:33] <%freelancebabymaker> embering up DOES mean you have to heal more
[2:24:34] <+Hilleltaco> large large large
[2:24:39] <Treasure_Vault> Does she know about which demon dying second mattering?
[2:24:40] <%SMuffinMan> Vape Naysh
[2:24:44] <+DeadlyPeaks> Oh hey, farfetched is streaming. She got her twitch affiliate
[2:24:45] <%abittershark> you don't even need to ember paige, cause you're just THAT HUGE
[2:24:45] <Jaysky> I beat this with Lapp no Gael
[2:24:49] <%Agami23> this was another boss that was fun to invade when the glitch was around
[2:24:51] <%RealThiele> Big McLargeHuge
[2:24:52] <BigFingerRo> @AVkid_ I'll take that as a compliment!
[2:24:54] <+Scevda> @treasure_vault not likely
[2:24:54] <%KeiganOfAstora> Maybe just summon one?
[2:25:07] <peachy996> middle ground would be 1 summon.
[2:25:09] <TheEndlessRiver1> run paige, not roll, run
[2:25:21] <%freelancebabymaker> 1 summon might be helpful for aggro control maybe
[2:25:22] <peachy996> You get the distraction and a slightly less tanky health bar
[2:25:25] <%AVkid_> @bigfingerro. oh it was maedre1Soju feetfeetHornyjail
[2:25:28] <infinityk11> Remeber today's lesson. ALWAYS RUN AWAY
[2:25:28] <%KeiganOfAstora> Fucking TOXIC?!?!
[2:25:33] <%KeiganOfAstora> They do Toxic Mist?
[2:25:33] <MiamiMemory> @PeachSaliva  Have you seen Space Jam 2
[2:25:35] <%arcaderabbit48> From two dudes at once!
[2:25:35] <BigFingerRo> HOLY CHRIST
[2:25:36] <%freelancebabymaker> how about we try 1 summon then
[2:25:40] <Paperware> First phase is much tougher without summon, but easier on the second
[2:25:41] <Tahzani> OMG Britney Spears
[2:25:45] <%SMuffinMan> Yep toxic
[2:25:46] <BigFingerRo> I SHIT YET AGAIN
[2:25:52] <@commanderclaw> Running is way faster and more stamina efficient
[2:25:54] <zhenthrim213> @KeiganOfAstora one does the other poisons
[2:25:57] <Dunmarkh> I recommend mashing roll more
[2:26:02] <%Monkeyweed21> also focus on the one thats on fire and attacking you
[2:26:02] <Jaysky> It's doo doo
[2:26:07] <DSD24> It exists
[2:26:09] <$Sphincter_Spelunker> it was a movie
[2:26:09] <%SMuffinMan> Was it?
[2:26:10] <%sporeian94> "film"
[2:26:12] <xFayt1> each one has stamina, sorta, they get tired after a big combo
[2:26:13] <peachy996> It was a Space Jam 2
[2:26:15] <infinityk11> it was alright
[2:26:16] <BigFingerRo> Peach I beg for mercy, I can't shit myself in impotence so many times
[2:26:17] <%KeiganOfAstora> Maybe just summon Gael?
[2:26:18] <+Scevda> One fine commercial
[2:26:24] <Setaro> Has your character always had glasses? It's so cute
[2:26:25] <klooswep> It did indeed have frames and sound.
[2:26:26] <%sporeian94> And Martin Scorsese says Marvel movies aren't cinema...
[2:26:27] <jetpack_rorschasch> It's true, it WAS a film, technically.
[2:26:29] <%hewlettfan96> Was it comically awful??
[2:26:30] <%AVkid_> @bigfingerro. if not for me... for your family.......stop shitting BibleThump
[2:26:31] <infinityk11> 7.5 out of 10
[2:26:32] <@commanderclaw> You see the new Best of the Worst? It's a good one
[2:26:32] <%KeiganOfAstora> Actually Lapp is a better summon, he's stronger
[2:26:37] <Jaysky> Lapp more tanky
[2:26:40] <tacostarvedbeast> you got this paige <3
[2:26:44] <+CaityCoopScoops> u can do it!
[2:26:44] <+Hilleltaco> "Of all the films I've watched, Space Jam 2 was one of them"
[2:26:45] <%freelancebabymaker> maybe try just one summon?
[2:26:46] <anAngryHamster> They didn't go to space and there was no jams!
[2:26:46] <xFayt1> it isn't easy to see since so much goes on in this fight
[2:26:49] <infinityk11> maybe 8 out of 10
[2:26:53] <%KeiganOfAstora> Just summon one
[2:26:53] <MiamiMemory> I can't believe MJ was such a good actor this whole time
[2:26:53] <%ChungusQuest> HUGE AND POWERFUL
[2:26:55] <+Scevda> Your doing fine
[2:26:56] <%Monkeyweed21> @PeachSaliva what if Coffee Lady watches this stream
[2:26:57] <danknugglit> In hammer we trust
[2:26:59] <%sporeian94> THEY DIDN'T EVEN USE THE SPACE JAM THEME
[2:27:01] <Dunmarkh> just lapp
[2:27:02] <BigFingerRo> @AVkid_ I ONLY DO IT SOCIALLYYYYY, DON'T LOOK AT MEEEE
[2:27:02] <%KeiganOfAstora> USE YOUR EMBERS OMG
[2:27:06] <%JenovasPuppet> Ember every time. You have SO MANY!
[2:27:10] <%arcaderabbit48> You have OVER 50
[2:27:11] <Treasure_Vault> One summon distracts without pumping their health up too high
[2:27:12] <+Scevda> As a treat
[2:27:13] <tacostarvedbeast> who coffe lady?
[2:27:14] <%nip_nips> pat gave her the link
[2:27:15] <+FoolsArcade> you should tell her to watch
[2:27:16] <%FacetiousAF> not yet Kappa
[2:27:17] <%optimasmaximas> YOU DONT KNOW THAT
[2:27:18] <eyeobject> use one of your 50 embers
[2:27:21] <zhenthrim213> WAT
[2:27:21] <+zamatermort> But what IF tho
[2:27:22] <%KeiganOfAstora> You have plenty of Embers and you can buy more. Please for the love of god Paige use your embers
[2:27:23] <%arcaderabbit48> Use your Embers, you're almost done with the game!
[2:27:23] <%RealThiele> OR DOES SHE
[2:27:24] <%sporeian94> Paige how old is coffee lady...
[2:27:24] <%Idziman> how do you think she learned your name?
[2:27:26] <%Dirty_Dandere> What if GIRLS are watching???
[2:27:27] <infinityk11> she might
[2:27:28] <Dunmarkh> GOOD
[2:27:32] <%freelancebabymaker> having one summon to pull aggro might be helpful
[2:27:32] <MiamiMemory> @sporeian94  QUAD CITY DJs GOT ROBBED
[2:27:33] <CrimsonFox777> @tacostarvedbeast Local Barista Paige has a crush on.
[2:27:33] <$Sphincter_Spelunker> frenchies out PunOko
[2:27:35] <%KeiganOfAstora> Yes holy christ lol
[2:27:35] <%TheWinged7> guess its time foryou to leave then pat
[2:27:35] <%Grimlockfly> You should summon cuz u almost beat the boss with them
[2:27:36] <xFayt1> reminder, embers can be used as a single full heal
[2:27:39] <BigFingerRo> It would be beyond surreal if she ran out of embers doing this
[2:27:41] <tacostarvedbeast> yea this is a english bull dog stream, no frenchies allowed
[2:27:41] <@commanderclaw> The only people we don't allow here are Zeons. Damned space traitors
[2:27:42] <%RealThiele> GET OUT PAT
[2:27:42] <Jaysky> I'd ember mid fight
[2:27:43] <+Scevda> Racist!
[2:27:43] <+zamatermort> So THAT is why she is learning French Kappa
[2:27:43] <RushUnplugged> you also have FIFTY THREE
[2:27:44] <The_UnfathoMarble> BEN LÀ LÀ
[2:27:45] <%KeiganOfAstora> We keep telling you, you might as well use an ember every damn time LUL
[2:27:45] <%g0atmeal> Embers are finite
[2:27:46] <%ItsRatman> you have 50 just use theme
[2:27:50] <+RowenCleric> I am coffee girl :)
[2:27:52] <SulfurousAcid> truuuuuuuuuuue @zamatermort
[2:27:53] <Dunmarkh> you ran past lapp
[2:27:53] <$Quack_of_Dawn> Pat always says not to ember because what if he needs it later
[2:27:58] <Dunmarkh> only lapp
[2:27:58] <zhenthrim213> lapp
[2:27:59] <%KeiganOfAstora> @g0atmeal Nope, some enemies drop them
[2:28:01] <%KeiganOfAstora> Only Lapp
[2:28:01] <%arcaderabbit48> ABE: Always Be Embered
[2:28:02] <tacostarvedbeast> I am farticus
[2:28:03] <SGrim> Both LUL
[2:28:05] <Jaysky> Lapp
[2:28:05] <%JenovasPuppet> @xFayt1 They can, but the animation is way longer than the Estus drink. It's risky in the middle of a fight.
[2:28:05] <@commanderclaw> Lapp is a strong lad, I recommend just Lapp
[2:28:06] <%optimasmaximas> one
[2:28:06] <BigYanno> Only Lapp
[2:28:08] <SulfurousAcid> you mean she ONLY has 53 @RushUnplugged
[2:28:09] <+Scevda> @quack_of_dawn 99 ether
[2:28:09] <%Grimlockfly> Do eet
[2:28:10] <%arcaderabbit48> Lapp Dance
[2:28:14] <%RealThiele> get that Lapp dance
[2:28:18] <%nip_nips> lapp best boi
[2:28:18] <%Monkeyweed21> Lapp is good boi
[2:28:23] <%g0atmeal> ok pat will farm lotheric knights if she runs out of embers
[2:28:26] <tacostarvedbeast> i like you ice scarf
[2:28:26] <eyeobject> She found it on the first try!
[2:28:26] <%KeiganOfAstora> LUL
[2:28:31] <%AVkid_> @bigfingerro. oh imma look at you *blashes and pulles lever releasing nickelodeon slime in the glory hole bathroom*
[2:28:32] <infinityk11> perfect
[2:28:33] <xFayt1> the animation isnt so long you cant find time for it
[2:28:33] <RushUnplugged> @SulfurousAcid yeha what if she runs out
[2:28:34] <%KeiganOfAstora> Literally slipping off ledges in video games
[2:28:35] <%Grimlockfly> Summon both
[2:28:44] <%arcaderabbit48> Maybe that should be a lesson to roll more carefully? Naaaah!
[2:28:53] <%KeiganOfAstora> Locking on doesn't seem to help much here
[2:28:54] <SulfurousAcid> why are you attacking the non aggro one tho?
[2:29:11] <Treasure_Vault> run away by method of walk into
[2:29:13] <$Sphincter_Spelunker> @AVkid_ sir, this is a twitch chat, not second life
[2:29:20] <%KeiganOfAstora> Don't lock on, use the camera to see where the other one is
[2:29:23] <%KeiganOfAstora> Ah frames
[2:29:24] <+Romuken> aaaaa
[2:29:28] <Jaysky> Jeez louise
[2:29:35] <%AVkid_> @sphincter_spelunker oh muh bad
[2:29:48] <infinityk11> shiddy tiddies
[2:29:51] <+Romuken> this is why you go magic
[2:29:53] <+Axellogic> Paige is so toxic
[2:29:58] <+Axellogic> :V
[2:30:01] <SovPho> man his hits are so laggy
[2:30:02] <SulfurousAcid> paige really out here trying to ignore toxic
[2:30:10] <@commanderclaw> Hmm, some blooming moss would be good here I think, save a lot of estus
[2:30:11] <%KeiganOfAstora> Toxic isn't going away quickly. Better to enter the menu and use an item, but it's Paige...
[2:30:13] <Treasure_Vault> Why the ass every time she knocks him down?
[2:30:18] <BigFingerRo> WHY IS IT ALWAYS THE BIG TELEGRAPHED ATTACKS THAT GET HER?
[2:30:19] <Treasure_Vault> Every opportunity, the ass
[2:30:20] <+DragonArt07> depending on which one dies first decides what attacks it uses in the second phase
[2:30:32] <%KeiganOfAstora> It feels like a stronger toxic
[2:30:37] <%arcaderabbit48> If anyone has the HP to facetanke Toxic, its her
[2:30:38] <benjiFG> watch her do it again
[2:30:43] <Treasure_Vault> Every change for a riposte, instead she gotta get in the booty
[2:30:44] <@commanderclaw> @BigFingerRo She overthinks it rather than just reacting
[2:30:50] <%JenovasPuppet> LUL
[2:30:58] <%GabeSweetMan> Remember Paige. healing is a sign of weakness.
[2:31:07] <MiamiMemory> Demon is in pain
[2:31:08] <CrimsonFox777> @BigFingerRo Paige's sight isn't her strong suit.
[2:31:15] <%arcaderabbit48> Lapp has taken almost no damage what the fucl
[2:31:16] <SulfurousAcid> You're gonna run out of estus before that toxic wears off paige
[2:31:20] <BigFingerRo> Healing poison is also for poosies
[2:31:23] <%KeiganOfAstora> Go into the menu and use a blooming moss clump
[2:31:24] <%JenovasPuppet> The glasses are out because the brain is bigger
[2:31:30] <$Quack_of_Dawn> @arcaderabbit48 phantoms are basically just damage sponges
[2:31:37] <Treasure_Vault> No
[2:31:38] <%Monkeyweed21> @arcaderabbit48 Shields are good
