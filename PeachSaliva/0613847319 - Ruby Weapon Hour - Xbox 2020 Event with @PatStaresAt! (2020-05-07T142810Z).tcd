[1:06:53] <pillowwasp> Show black viking
[1:06:54] <+nekodelic> @itsthelos yes, but the level of sugar-coating that they will need to do for the vikings is gonna be giant
[1:06:55] <spongeofmystery> 1222 is WAAAAAAY after the viking raids
[1:06:56] <Betofall> remember when leif erikson found amercia? thought it was stupid and just left?
[1:06:56] <+cowardman93> vikings did hang around here for a while
[1:06:57] <+dirtyh4rr1> Nice gameplay
[1:06:57] <+Yautjabutts> by 1222 the vikings were long gone
[1:06:57] <+greatgetter> Excellent, I go to the feilds outside my house

[1:07:00] <TurtlesAndTentacles> did I miss Elden Ring?
[1:07:01] <spongeofmystery> Like 300 years
[1:07:01] <DrFaustMD> there was on 12 rapes in 1222
[1:07:02] <AxelssonOnFire> I was hoping they would announce a cure to depression

[1:07:03] <+michingmallecho> Xbox “event” 🙄
[1:07:03] <+SkullfaceSam> Oh that's what everything is permitted was referring to
[1:07:03] <legacy0117> America was already explored in AC. They are running out of places to go.
[1:07:03] <Diana869> SUCH GAMEPLAY
[1:07:04] <ape_hawk> "hey guys, which time period were the vikings a lot less... rapey?"
[1:07:06] <%THATGUY_789> I can't wait for Assassin's Creed: Covid where Alitair stays home
[1:07:06] <SilverFaustX> it was called the Danelaw
[1:07:07] <itsthelos> Maybe we can wait until we get more story then
[1:07:09] <dreamfillah> Remember the North Sea Empire @peachsaliva
[1:07:09] <+UncleNam> This seems to be when the great heathen army arrived
[1:07:12] <$Corporate_Redeemer> "Guys maybe we should take a break for all the rape and murder?"
[1:07:12] <%rdark_ksu> the reason is resources
[1:07:13] <SPKTR34> IT'S OK THEY ARE TEMPLARS
