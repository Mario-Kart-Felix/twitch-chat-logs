[0:11:48] <AlfredoCavatelli> make paige kill papyrus
[0:11:48] <averagehero1> understandable

[0:12:09] <arcadeHemorrhage > ♥ u paige
[0:12:09] <MSN04_Sazabi> Paige MUST kill Papyrus with her own two hands
[0:12:09] <+BinaryForest> The grinding is easy though, it's just numbing to your feelings. The things that she'll actually need help for aren't that common
[0:12:09] <buffmurffy> jesus christ does she eat mcdonalds everyday!?!

[0:12:25] <Prevot> Determination is the power that will let you KILL THEM ALL

[0:12:28] <@thenefftw> Stay determined to your murder
[0:12:29] <darkfire344> Either Papyrus or the fight with Toriel will be the hardest
[0:12:35] <darkfire344> get ready for BIG TEARS
[0:12:38] <wsintai> SHE TRIED SO HARD, AND GOT SO FARRRRR...
[0:12:40] <CaramelTaffy> how is she eating this much Mcdonalds
[0:12:43] <+BinaryForest> If Pat's never done genocide firsthand I genuinely wonder if he'll be able to handle the tougher fights

[0:43:14] <Tanasinn> Mcdonalds fries are complete trash. They're always soggy and gross.
[0:43:14] <ckangaroo15k> BK used to have great chicken in the early 00's, but they changed it and it tastes like raw hotdog now.

[0:43:20] <@WoolyFish> A long chicken from BK is legit, though.

[0:48:29] <%caddellzor> cheer100 cheer100 This conversation about dicks and nailing Paige to the penis cross is perfect dialogue for this sad murderfest
[0:48:33] <Polarix64> It's purposly trying to stop you from doing genocide
[0:48:33] <%ziriken> TFS nuzlockes literally had hour long episodes on fridays just to podcast
[0:48:34] <BenLubar> they get scared
[0:48:34] <spartan_ermine> imagine 30 min of menus

[0:48:50] <+Antoids> Undertale: Part 30: Fighting Toriel
[0:48:52] <cizal11> the core and hotland are the same count, and you do them all in the last room of the core
[0:48:52] <mercado94> @europantlamprey paige really needs a #rubygrind

[1:19:02] <$lil_potayto> cheer200 Hey, Paige. Thanks for all the amazing content. This Undertale playthrough in particular has been such a joy for me this month as I've had a lot of stuff to work through. I've recently mustered up with the courage to come out to my parents about my decision to transition. If I can go through with that you can most certainly get through this last run. Stay big and strong, and most importantly, STAY DETERMINED!!
[1:19:02] <colzack_> I think she pretty much says stuff like "I thought I was protecting you from them but I was protecting them from you" or something
[1:19:02] <%Keyd00d> Why even stream this
[1:19:03] <SquadTeddy> Pat needs to stop reading chat too
[1:19:03] <%blackmagemasher> she may be goatmom, but i feel she also pushed asgore to war
[1:19:04] <weizamaleza> Just kill them all, its gonna be fine.
[1:19:04] <faegbeard> IGNORE THIS SHITSHOW

[2:12:47] <+Nefarious_Bear> @PeachSaliva Pat did you know that's based off a time that Toby found a quiche under a bench in real life?
[2:12:47] <Hawkbone_> @PeachSaliva This is a reference to the time Toby Fox found a quiche under a park bench, and tweeted about it talking as if it was an abandoned child

[2:14:43] <Silent_Fyraena> @PeachSaliva Unless it came up during an ad, I don't think my donation was read yet.
[2:14:44] <%ziriken> The fight isnt until the bridge. everything else prior can be progressed to
[2:14:44] <AzureKayZ> Wait I thought Pat was the one who was gonna play Genocide
[2:14:49] <FrustratedAF> i need a coding boot camp, i can barely grasp java :/

[2:15:04] <17sevens> you need to grind soon
[2:15:05] <buffmurffy> will she get the geno dummy fight without grinding first?
[2:15:08] <KeithKuruzu> Wow, just got in for a stream and I see Paige is the one playing Genocide. How broken up was she from Papyrus??
[2:15:08] <+AXL808> yoooo
[2:15:11] <+Hilleltaco> @AzureKayZ For the more difficult parts probably, not all of it
[2:15:12] <%StraaMcLovin> No, they're not. There is plenty of time to grind before the boss
[2:15:12] <+micalica> that's still so funny
[2:15:21] <$TomServal> @dethhollow Don't worry.
[2:15:23] <Hawkbone_> @PeachSaliva Pat, remember to grind at some point, the rest of chat wont shut up about it. Do it in the room before Temmie Village.
[2:15:27] <%Vascune> cheer100 next time you get an encounter look above Chara's head
[2:15:28] <Sloavon> actually thats true
[2:15:29] <$autismweaponised> guts calm down, they know
[2:15:32] <AlchemiBeast> no, papyrus did nothing wrong. that was not self defence.
[2:15:34] <CrematedCube> the lantern room is the best for grinding I believe
[2:15:34] <InspectahDecck> Guys do you think they know about the grinding ? Maybe you should repeat it again
[2:15:38] <$avarice99> Spoken like a barbarian
[2:15:40] <$ToxInjection> So necessary you said it twice
[2:15:41] <Dj_FallingStar> she had to take a moment with Papyrus

[2:16:14] <missingangle> can she do it in this room, though? :/
[2:16:20] <Hispanacomida25> Do you kill monster kid in a fight or cutscene? I honestly forgot
[2:16:24] <ricksaintriot> I think it's just a comic. I'm not sure.
[2:16:27] <JackalopeHerd> talk to this guy
[2:16:31] <+magusdraco> no nice cream
[2:16:32] <Louie_Salmon> @inspectahdecck It's a fast chat and Pat has other stuff to read. They want to make sure he sees, because of how easy it is to mess up.
[2:16:36] <lotharrio> Sans is probably upset about you killing his brother.
[2:16:44] <+TsunamiPoro> sans is.... busy
[2:16:45] <Neo_Kefka> no nice cream for murderers
[2:16:50] <the_phantom_theif> He might be upset...a bit.
[2:16:52] <cizal11> left
[2:16:53] <@MelBrooksKA> @Jonami90 It's just an MS Paint
[2:16:57] <+Antoids> Sans is mad about Papyrus dying for some indiscernable reason. What a baby.
[2:17:00] <RafflesiaA> The thing is, Pat knows how easy it is to mess up and he's also doing his best
[2:17:01] <morat2255> Sans is probably glad his annoying brother isn't around to bother him any more.
[2:17:02] <Jaxiis0> yeah there's still time before the fight

[2:27:35] <+StriderGerry> I sure hope he's not reading chat
[2:27:37] <%fangdsniper2nd> cheer100 Ah before I forget, there are 4 kinds of pains in the Genocide run. The pain of loss, the pain of the grind, The pain of guilt and the pain of the bosses. You will experience all of these and more little monarch.
[2:27:43] <Lukas_Ipsum> i showed up too late to follow along now, will check the vod tomorrow. will someone just tell me if they're going for cruel kills or just normal kills?
[2:27:49] <+SmoothEnigma> @suikudo of course not, everyone in chat is acting 5 years old micSip
[2:27:52] <cisealnine> Paige just said "Eh".
[2:27:53] <%ziriken> @Lukas_Ipsum theyre trying, but bad at em
[2:27:56] <ricksaintriot> Cruel kills, I think.
[2:28:00] <Hispanacomida25> Pacifist runs take to long since you're running the gimmicks often

[2:39:51] <hkey_local_machine> cheat!
[2:39:52] <%ziriken> cheat
[2:39:52] <+SaltyTheRower> Just cheat
[2:39:54] <%ThePushaMan> you need practice
[2:39:54] <pitsuji> cheat
[2:39:54] <+spacehouse> time for pat and paige to GIT GUD
[2:39:55] <+Hilleltaco> True love is helping with a genocide for the one you love
[2:39:56] <InspectahDecck> @PeachSaliva You should buy the invincibility items for final boss
[2:39:56] <Dragon_Batman> I believe in you
[2:39:57] <%Warfey> welcome to die
[2:39:57] <Cheapheatmo> you know what you're gonna do? you're gonna have a BAD TIME
[2:39:59] <$oxiderous> How is it that whatever Toby works on breeds the worst of fanbases
[2:40:01] <amavii> make her do it, fuck it
[2:40:01] <%Keyd00d> final boss took me like 4 hours
[2:40:03] <+TsunamiPoro> 24 hour livestream
[2:40:05] <%ssjklyco> Sans will probably be rough
[2:40:08] <LeeOhX> If Pat says he's gonna be awful, does his stand make him unstoppable
[2:40:09] <$autismweaponised> You have to go ultra instinct
[2:40:09] <Bendy_V> The invincibility doesn't work?
[2:40:10] <ADeadDiehard> Give up halfway through..?
[2:40:11] <TheImmortal70> No it wont', sans breaks invincibility
[2:40:12] <MSN04_Sazabi> Poison bypasses that, deosn't it?
[2:40:12] <+Bobato_Chaps> Make her take the first 10 deaths
[2:40:13] <+KingZaffy> Invincibility is LITERALLY pointless for the final boss.
[2:40:13] <MadTimeWizard> yes he does
[2:40:13] <+magusdraco> he does ignore that shit
[2:40:14] <+StriderGerry> yes
[2:40:14] <@thenefftw> Yes
[2:40:16] <$Jazzarms> pat is correct
[2:40:17] <cizal11> he does
[2:40:18] <%SergeEXE> yeah it don't matter
[2:40:18] <%Kataguro> Final Boss ignores the fuck out of that
[2:40:19] <%fangdsniper2nd> I honestly thinkl that Paige should just throw herself at the final boss until she wins
[2:40:19] <%korth367> @PeachSaliva call billy over to do it for you : ^ )
[2:40:19] <+gliph13> pat maybe you should do the grinding for practice for you_Know_who.
[2:40:19] <mercado94> so its gonna be like liam streams of KH2? A whole stream dedicated to one boss
[2:40:20] <+SirBaconsworth> that is correct
[2:40:20] <Personified134> Undyne doesn't tho
[2:40:21] <+Antoids> @PeachSaliva that's why i was kinda insistent you get the quiche
[2:40:21] <+queaks> Have you fought him before Pat?
[2:40:22] <%ThePushaMan> pat is correct
[2:40:22] <tomokocchi_> yeah, the final boss ignores everything
[2:40:22] <Hispanacomida25> Yeah good idea to just do it instead of Paige
[2:40:23] <%SergeEXE> none a this matters
[2:40:24] <%th3madness> for the other boss pat
[2:40:24] <bathosbathtime> Not useful for the final, but useful before it
[2:40:25] <+Bloodxb> yea he does 1.damage
[2:40:25] <%ziriken> The invincibilty is good for undyn tho
[2:40:25] <%ssaryn> Yep. Go for ALL Defense.
[2:40:25] <zamzoph> the final boss is actually really easy Kappa
[2:40:26] <%Townspoon> cheat engine would help the final boss ya knowww
[2:40:26] <%Keyd00d> It's good for Undyne
[2:40:27] <+wingblade7> avoid genderred pronouns to avoid spoilers of final boss
[2:40:27] <%fangdsniper2nd> Yeah Sans negates I frames
[2:40:27] <ManfredA> invincibility is for Undyne
[2:40:27] <DapperHatwell> No he doesnt
[2:40:28] <ThePuddingDead> @PeachSaliva So Pat, I'm glad you decided to start watching some TNG with Plague, I found his recent stream with you guys and watched "Q Who?" for the first time and it was awesome!
[2:40:28] <%guessingtwo> its good for undyne
[2:40:28] <%StraaMcLovin> final boss ignores all stats other than health I think
[2:40:28] <Damashi_The_Kaotic> He SUPER ignores it
[2:40:29] <Twoiis> You'll be fine. It'll just take a bit of practice.
[2:40:33] <Zeikier> the only good item for the fnial boss is the frying pan, if only nominally
[2:40:34] <SpinnySpinda> @mercado94 Hah
[2:40:35] <Ted_the_red> San's attacks take away in tics doesn't he
[2:40:37] <%fangdsniper2nd> It's good for Undyne
[2:40:38] <Baron_von_Turkeyfish> final boss does yes but undyn doesnt
[2:40:38] <%ryuail1> Final Boss can only do 1 damage at a time, idk what you're worried about Kappa
[2:40:40] <%Triggerhappy938> Paige has to do the final boss
[2:40:40] <UnderpaidBob> lol he only does 1dmg
[2:40:41] <+ghor7> no pronouns!!
[2:40:42] <+frobeards> frying pan is honestly your best bet for the end
[2:40:44] <%Triggerhappy938> It's not real unless she does it
[2:40:44] <%honorable_captain_garlock> he ignores hitstun
[2:40:47] <Ninjagregory98> Is it possible to kill the turtle?
[2:40:51] <SaltyDongs> Lie Cheat Die
[2:40:51] <%Warfey> Mur Der Dance
[2:40:51] <sangi53> don't say the fucking name
[2:40:52] <naranjalimones> He only does 1 damage PER FRAME OF CONTACT
[2:40:52] <@corn_on_fire> Kappa
[2:40:52] <swordsman776> It's useful on the upcoming boss
[2:40:57] <%ThePushaMan> paige has to attempt it like once
[2:40:57] <+Nefarious_Bear> BOOT IN ASS
[2:40:57] <Katyusha94> B O O M
[2:41:00] <%galaxyswirl> San's is the most op eva
[2:41:00] <ghost_teeth> Paige would just assume he means Asgore again
[2:41:02] <%finaltrinity5> oh fuck is this the genocide run?
[2:41:02] <+spider_S3> Remove Tem
[2:41:03] <%Solid_Seth> The Final Boss ignores all I FRAMES. He breaks the games rules.
[2:41:04] <Elexius> Wow way to murder Temmie perfectly
[2:41:05] <+LandOfTheWay> damn, perfect crit
[2:41:05] <Hawkbone_> @PeachSaliva How long do you expect Undyne and final boss to take? Do you expect to have to do an entire stream just for the final boss?
[2:41:06] <AussieYak> What you do for the final boss is get some food sorted IRL cause you'll be there forever aussie3DARLING
[2:41:08] <duneblythe> Gnot pointless for undine
[2:41:08] <Nitsuj293> remember the up down trick
[2:41:10] <ape_hawk> hi peepee
[2:41:10] <baronvonkame> final boss also applies a DOT I think? but I also dont think DOT can kill you by itself
[2:41:11] <Nistego> TEM FAILED COLLEGE
[2:41:12] <+ConstipatedLlama> Why doesn't the knife matter
[2:41:12] <+LtShuckle> @peachsaliva do the wall glitch
[2:41:13] <%fangdsniper2nd> Apron and frying Pan are the best
[2:41:14] <SolitudeOtM> Hold up and down against a wall Pat
[2:41:14] <+SchlomoGoldbergsteinowitz> shhhh chat no more spoilers
[2:41:15] <jayordanny> the final boss is the weakest enemy, he only has 1 HP Kappa
[2:41:18] <Louie_Salmon> Reminder that you can do the up+down dance for easy grinding.

[2:54:17] <%fangdsniper2nd> cheer100 Undyne always had some small amount of Determination. In other runs it tears her apart. However, this is different. She's fighting with more than just her determination.

[2:55:01] <The_Introspector> Elmo is the final boss.
[2:55:05] <+earthboundjunky> That extended invulnerability would be helpful here
[2:55:05] <%Solid_Seth> Elmo looks through your soul.
[2:55:05] <Damashi_The_Kaotic> You'll want to save the pieces for the end boss though
[2:55:06] <Lysdexic9541> DESTROY ELMO SwiftRage
[2:55:07] <Mittensbro> @PeachSaliva Snowman pieces are better to be saved for _that fight_

[2:55:24] <%ThePushaMan> Nah dont use the pieces till sans
[2:55:28] <LeeOhX> Pat's figuring it out
[2:55:30] <Louie_Salmon> But do you want to spend those snowman pieces now, or save them for the REAL shit?

[2:55:46] <suikudo> Masterfully dodged
[2:55:47] <Neo_Kefka> legendary heros are almost as good as the snowman pieces and you can get tons of those before the next fight
[2:55:49] <EASrake> Her eyepatch is gone too
[2:55:54] <devanmuse> the glint in her eye is ANOTHER SPEAR
[2:55:57] <Cheapheatmo> she is

[2:56:36] <Valkyrjsen> Pat probably has to practice this a bit.
[2:56:36] <KeithKuruzu> Yeah, those yellow arrows get me every time.
[2:56:37] <HypemasterMonty> These are super hard TBH, I remember a friend thinking she was harder than the last boss
[2:56:37] <%ziriken> pat, if you can use the keyboard, use it, muscle memory is way better for htis fight @PeachSaliva
[2:56:38] <%Warfey> Using the Keyboard might be worth considering?
[2:56:38] <$BioStormX> Imagine if you had more invincibility frames
[2:56:39] <+KDZen_> @Toynota10 link? that sounds awesome

[2:56:42] <+Antoids> Pat, you can handle this.
[2:56:43] <%guessingtwo> go get those items from turtle
[2:56:43] <jcvbeast> It’s designed around keyboard controls, not gamepad
[2:56:44] <+Bail_seven> gonna have a bad time
[2:56:46] <johnthecoolmex> When i did it i already had the patters engraved into my mind, it was crazy
[2:56:46] <+TechGamer> It's going to take practice for sure
[2:56:46] <+jazzcrasher> Triple Q made really good mashup of this song
[2:56:47] <Elexius> @grenadier42 im glad you pointed that out, the piano especially screams touhou vibes
[2:56:48] <edgybuttlazy> Honestly I thing undyne is harder
[2:56:48] <%TeamSe7yn> easier on keyboard
[2:56:48] <Benpower236> Paige would have never made it.

[2:56:59] <KingGuthorm> Yeah Undyne is the realest
[2:57:00] <Unity028> stay determined!!!
[2:57:05] <@ckbooks> It'd be good to stop at these tough bosses so you can practice them a little off stream if you want.
[2:57:05] <Stab_master_ars0n> Get the runback best of 5
[2:57:06] <LostKing> Big I frames
[2:57:09] <Hispanacomida25> Oh man. That's rough
[2:57:10] <Tanasinn> @Elexius It's specifically the zun trumpet being used and all that
[2:57:10] <Pookiedaexzile> keyboard is faster
[2:57:11] <subjectg> @elexius dude there are literal zunpets later on
[2:57:11] <%psychodave1234> almost 3 hours, cool
[2:57:16] <RafflesiaA> @Elexius In the part of the track we haven't gotten to yet, there's even the trumpets
[2:57:24] <StreaminDemons> I beat Undyne after a while, but I didn't manage to beat the final boss, even up until now. They're just such a piece of shit, I haven't tried in a long time though.
[2:57:25] <+Hilleltaco> This was a PC game after all. At least originally
[2:57:26] <+WingBuffet> can't you just run away to Hotland once you're red?
[2:57:27] <naranjalimones> Isn't Mettaton NEO a big deal?

[2:57:38] <+TsunamiPoro> incorrect
[2:57:40] <%Squishy3> Its really just all memorization
[2:57:43] <+OdysseyKnight> Woolie had direction problems
[2:57:45] <Sloavon> woolie doesn't know left from right
[2:57:47] <%fangdsniper2nd> The final boss is objectively harder because it is unfair. This is fair but almost as hard
[2:57:48] <Fiercxt> Nice one pat
[2:57:48] <CactusChef3> elmo loves the taste of murder
[2:57:50] <EASrake> Port... NO STARBOARD
[2:57:52] <%guessingtwo> @wingbuffet not for genocide lol
[2:57:52] <%ziriken> Undyne took me about 2 or 3 hours alone
[2:57:56] <+Snaketsu> Undyne is the real winner here
[2:57:59] <Graxe_> That's basically Reality Stone pre-nerf.
[2:58:02] <%korth367> HER NUMBER IS SO BIG
[2:58:03] <+KingZaffy> It's Guitar Hero syndrome; you're used to playing on Expert then fuck up on Easy
[2:58:04] <Personified134> Is paige more in love with her than with papyrus now?
[2:58:04] <+SvenHolgersson> BIG AND STRONG FISH LADY
[2:58:04] <+SchlomoGoldbergsteinowitz> I agree. You can memorize the final boss's patterns, but I'm too stupid to do those backwards arrows
[2:58:05] <DraxTD> Paige has new lady boner for Undine
[2:58:06] <zafooru> physically large and athletic
[2:58:07] <+KanjiBestHusbando> They both challenge you in different ways

[2:58:27] <xeros720> call someone who plays rhythm games quick
[2:58:32] <%guessingtwo> @snaketsu not really, since what happens at the end would happen no matter what
[2:58:43] <grandmonkbun> We got to believe
[2:58:44] <+Onlysamfisher > is this battle considered suicide? on the count of Paige literally being undyne?
[2:58:45] <BenLubar> has she used all four of her attacks yet
[2:58:47] <$evermoore_hex> pat fails at ddr, the movie
[2:58:50] <+KgKid51> This boss took me like 2hrs
[2:58:50] <AlchemiBeast> youre improving, which is good
[2:58:51] <Bionicghost> FIGHTO
[2:58:51] <+LilNatFour> do you think has a bigger number between Undyne and Jiren?
[2:58:53] <+Comrade_Vladof> Pat, stop panicing
[2:58:55] <SolitudeOtM> The Undyne fight might need it's own stream, for me personally, took about 3 days cause them arrows trip me the fuck up

[2:59:04] <%Radoh> Paige shittalking Pat for having a hard time of this when she lost to the second attack is Pure Paige.
[2:59:04] <Valkyrjsen> You pretty much just have to memorize her arrow attacks. They're always the same.

[3:26:26] <+other_badger> is papyrus a shota though?
[3:26:28] <shamelessotaku1> at least pat gets to do some of the killing
[3:26:33] <+AntithesisEK> bone jumping, bone jokes, etc, etc.
[3:26:36] <@thenefftw> Killer is Dead
[3:26:37] <%ssaryn> That's a good Catherine reference.

[3:27:29] <zamzoph> You don't have to do it, Paige
[3:27:30] <+fireking900> YOU COULD HAVE STOPPED
[3:27:31] <%fangdsniper2nd> It is your fault and your fault only
[3:27:32] <+Hilleltaco> Reminder again that even if you don't kill everyone else and you stop here, the damage is still done, the true pacifist ending is now reversed
[3:27:39] <+thesw1tch> she is releasing babies. she can't get pregnant right now. shut up you savages... but also is it your fault?

[3:27:54] <faegbeard> RIGHT IN THE NAME
[3:27:54] <Solidus_Nate> @PeachSaliva Undyne watched Anime
[3:27:57] <+TheGershon> It's the power of GOD and ANIME
[3:27:59] <pettywolfthing> Its the power of anime, Paige
[3:28:00] <Ell1ot> They're not ANIME enough, Paige
[3:28:00] <%ssjklyco> ANIME Gives you determination confirmed
[3:28:01] <@WoolyFish> It's because of anime
[3:28:01] <FrostedZaibatsu> Alphys injected her eye with determination @Peachsaliva
[3:28:03] <+LtShuckle> SPIRAL POWER
[3:28:04] <ghost_teeth> Undyne's whole thing is how much she cares
[3:28:05] <+SvenHolgersson> ANIME POWER
[3:28:07] <prismaticsnake> yeah, literally determination
[3:28:11] <SwindlerOfProgress> She was about to die, but her soul came back together because she needed to stop you.
[3:28:16] <+omega_reddu> Thats what being a real hero is all about.
[3:28:19] <@WoolyFish> She watched My Hero Academia season 3 and got super pumped.
[3:28:19] <+unknowingchuck> she has the power of god and anime on her side
[3:28:20] <mercado94> do you know what determonation means?
[3:28:20] <Klefth> Well, just remember what happens to monsters with determination..
[3:28:22] <suikudo> Look at skelmo;s face of absolute horror
[3:28:25] <%ssaryn> Because of the Baby.
[3:28:25] <%fangdsniper2nd> Monster's physical forms liertally fall apart with too much DT
[3:28:26] <$PocketSandRyan> Lizard people are part human
[3:28:27] <%LumberjackJack> @peachsaliva Because Undyne learned from anime

[3:28:58] <+Nomicro4u> Mood swings and strong emotions are a side effect of being pregnant
[3:29:12] <%Warfey> sipsipHellmo
[3:29:15] <%waddledoops> she has the power of ASGORE and anime on her side
[3:29:18] <%TheOnlyStrayCat> cheer100 If she takes Skelmo to bed, make sure Mister Buzz Buzz is in another room. Or it's gonna get really awkward. But then again, maybe it's better than indulging in her furry need to breed.
[3:29:23] <%krawtch> need Toby Fox X David Cage game to find out if it will be BAD or THE WORST
[3:29:27] <Kaitepaints> I thought that she built her armor inspired by anime
[3:29:30] <wsintai> @thenefftw @WoolyFish You guys can probably either turn off slow mode, or lower the delay now. There's a lot less people on then there were.
[3:29:31] <%ziriken> @TheOnlyStrayCat thank you
[3:29:31] <%ssaryn> Waow
[3:29:40] <darkfire344> Its actually reminiscent of a Skyrim quote "Is it better to be born good, or to overcome your evil nature through great effort"

[3:30:18] <OkamiDude15> @PeachSaliva pat you hear about max getting into ff14?
[3:30:18] <Mittensbro> the reason people keep telling you to quit is because the entire point of the genocide run is to convince you to quit

[3:30:49] <ricksaintriot> It is always better to be born good than to have to strive to be good. Striving is wasted energy that you could have used to just do good things in the first place.
[3:30:54] <%ssaryn> Eat like... 2 Jalapeno peppers.
[3:30:59] <%krawtch> haha, woolies butt

[3:31:42] <beardedprof> moano was kinda good tho
[3:31:42] <+ConstipatedLlama> moana's fine, but you also think Your Name is shit soooo
[3:31:42] <zaptar13> Moana was fine

[3:31:48] <bryanmildew> i never saw moana cause i'm not 8
[3:31:49] <+SvenHolgersson> She won;t say Zootopia because of the whole "furry" thing
[3:31:52] <Tanasinn> ghostpepper's alright, but I'd like to get my hands on some reaper. Or the brain pepper that's not nearly as hot as the reaper, but still above ghostpepper
[3:31:53] <+InkblotBlues> Brave was amazing though.
[3:31:54] <%ssjklyco> Disney movies arent great in general
[3:31:54] <%TheOnlyStrayCat> She loves Zootopia though.
[3:31:56] <@Moobot> YOU'RE BEING TOO LOUD! (Fenrirlives) (warning)
[3:31:57] <+KoolaidLegend> Coco was pixar
[3:31:58] <+LilNatFour> you also hate your name so idk about trusting your taste in movies
[3:32:06] <bendatron> Pat you forget woolie came up with jesus' stand being three days grace

[3:32:35] <figgely> One girl in my friend's media literacy class did a movie analysis on frozen where she said it was about women helping each other but it's just like. how old are you
[3:32:37] <+SvenHolgersson> Brave was okay if you never saw any of the trailers cuz they were all lies
[3:32:37] <%Djinnazz> yes...?
[3:32:39] <+thesw1tch> Michael Scott is awesome
[3:32:41] <+TheGershon> Exactly your point
[3:32:43] <%ssaryn> Like "Brillant Knife Move, Very Difficult"
[3:32:44] <gooman_the_gooster> still better than Hans Christian Anderson's version
[3:32:46] <%babblingcabbage> Like pregnant
[3:32:47] <Prevot> she doesn't even rermember it, it's okay LUL
[3:32:53] <Polarix64> It's true though you don't actually have to do genocide
