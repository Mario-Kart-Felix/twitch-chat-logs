[0:12:12] <$Katashi25> idk why, but the stream is great on my phone, but on my ps4 the frame rate is somewhat choppy
[0:12:13] <$Falilth> it seems low because of the bounce
[0:12:13] <morningmoondude> i think the camera shaking so much is what messes with it
[0:12:14] <+RPG_CHICAGO> hey, it's a paige
[0:12:14] <+SteamyLinguini64> It looks great better than the weird skeleton basement
[0:12:14] <%PrincessAlex23> PrincessAlex23 subscribed with Prime. They've subscribed for 4 months! Hello Today, Paige!  Nice mustard.
[0:12:15] <+McSoliace> its pretty but low frame rate
[0:12:15] <%ospreyworks> Maybe it's less than 24?
[0:12:16] <$KnivesEve> paige is on delay based netcode
[0:12:16] <ArkSeaside> maybe Paige is just living in low framerate
[0:12:17] <+luftraumm1> maybe bit rate is weird
[0:12:17] <%SuckerPunchSyd> It might be the shaking of the camera
[0:12:18] <+BettyMwwaahh> yea its just shakin
[0:12:19] <+PatchTheGamer> framerate is fine
[0:12:19] <Lutre> pats boomer eyes don't go above 24fps
[0:12:19] <%Chichen> webcam is low fps
[0:12:19] <rafaelba93> IS THAT MUSTARD
[0:12:20] <TheZearGuy> Looks good to me
[0:12:20] <JoeStillLife> I think its because of the wobble.
[0:12:20] <+RealThiele> so its paige
[0:12:21] <$ZeOrbling> it cuts like every 10th frame
[0:12:22] <%arran_throttle> Lol

[0:12:26] <TuxedoNash> Like 48fps at source
[0:12:26] <sakeydo> Dancing elmo donation cut off
[0:12:26] <+AgniBrandt> That might be it, Pat

[0:12:33] <+fraillightning> turning off low light compensation in advanced settings will make it smoother
[0:12:34] <Varadox> It's low-framerate, Pat.
[0:12:34] <%W1nterTitan> Pat's right

Getting used to a new device is always a jarring experience as I have to reset bookmarks that I can remember and mess with settings and relog in to places and all this shit...

[0:13:15] <+BigCoffee> It's not that bad, just don't shake the desk
[0:13:15] <+tweedler92> Well lit Pat and Paige is different
[0:13:16] <+Dunmarkh> the human eye can't see more than 15fps
[0:13:16] <$thomassolorio> by uping the frame rate
[0:13:19] <Xelhesia> @PeachSaliva you're also in 4:3 aspect ratio.
[0:13:20] <+Kurt_0> Always has mustard in reach

[0:13:23] <farrellcityking> More Elmo and Mustard!
[0:13:23] <robobeau> if there is a lot of light compensation the frame rate can take a hit
[0:13:23] <Meltgar> Stream upload??
[0:13:24] <+Mr_Pylon> Tried refreshing and things do look low framey, also 4:3?
[0:13:24] <foolishorion> The mustard realm

[0:20:17] <+BettyMwwaahh> Gaygenda
[0:20:18] <Pookiedaexzile> Pat is somehow more bald out of focus
[0:20:19] <udurbalanced> After all, Paige does is the gay
[0:20:19] <sakeydo> Get green screen
[0:20:19] <farrellcityking> That mustard looks like it’s hazardous
[0:20:21] <@commanderclaw> Nice

[0:20:22] <$thomassolorio> much prity pat big lucky
[0:20:22] <Namaztak> also set the camera to video mode, it looks like it's in some stills mode, otherwise it'd give you a 16:9 frame
[0:20:22] <$AzureGale> Hawt
[0:20:23] <TuxedoNash> why is the gay agenda covered in mustard stains
[0:20:23] <%GabeSweetMan> Nice

[0:20:37] <Reveresao> Green Screen
[0:20:38] <ArkSeaside> eye contact is unhealthy for us, we can't contain such power

[0:20:55] <%crowlord4> Is it just me or is there some desynch?
[0:20:56] <JoeStillLife> 4:3 is for the art

[0:22:25] <+thesickestzak> nliBEEP nliBEEP
[0:22:26] <%Carquar> You look lovely Paige!
[0:22:27] <Namaztak> Change to 60 fps output in camera settings, turn off auto white balance, set the camera to one of its video modes
[0:22:29] <Calek> sonic the hedgehog~
[0:22:29] <farrellcityking> Make this type of stream every time
[0:22:29] <PleaseCallMeSugar> paige please also check the aspect ratio
[0:22:31] <+Prinny_Raider> I understand that TNG reference
[0:22:33] <ragasquid> this lighting is weird because you look real

[0:22:50] <+Minorou> still love that SATAM music
[0:22:51] <tictoc_clock> Yo Peach swinging by to say Gief is gorgeous boy, Elmo is best baby, and congrats to you and Pat!
[0:22:56] <peachy996> Spinning? that's a nice trick
[0:22:57] <dots4eyes> Does this mean more Paige streams incoming? Hmm...
[0:22:57] <$JoshManVGH> pat and the room look like an animated Zoom background with all the lights on.
[0:23:02] <armchairmaster_> Smol pat
[0:23:08] <$Wurmspawn> BRB animation needs Geif inclusion now.
[0:23:19] <+GalacticaPhanto> oh this needs to be updated with the pig dog boy
[0:23:23] <Shion963> might as well make a Pat zoom background
[0:23:38] <hookycookie> Need a cardboard cut out of Pat for background moral support!
[0:23:41] <sakeydo> Buy smart bulb for different colored mood lighting
[0:23:41] <farrellcityking> From now on, all streams will be of asking the chat if this looks okay... more shots of Elmo being awesome, gratuitous shots of mustard... and no Zangeif
[0:23:43] <+PirateKefka> Pat Zoom background is just the pic of him in the shame closet
[0:23:47] <@MistyMntns> @Shion963 Damn now I want to make that now.
[0:23:58] <viviknight> wah

[0:24:06] <+Dunmarkh> psaWhat
[0:24:06] <%Starotter70> Oh no
[0:24:06] <%AyotoCorp> You should get a greenscreen so the dungeon wall can come back
[0:24:07] <@Jekado> YOU KILLED PAT!
[0:24:07] <+zsDirtyHarry> This BRB art is amazing. I love pouty Pat
[0:24:08] <$Wurmspawn> Earthquake

[0:24:18] <%Grimlockfly> :D
[0:24:19] <ZComiX> is the stream set to 60 fps?
[0:24:21] <rafaelba93> its fine
[0:24:21] <moonmintparadise> wiggle wiggle wiggle
[0:24:22] <Namaztak> Put it in video mode with the dial on top of it
[0:24:23] <balthazar758> pat has been unsummoned
[0:24:24] <+SveriSageAdvice> thats weird, i couldnt help with the camera unless i was seeing thhe OBS settings
[0:24:24] <%BinaryFireball> set it to 30
[0:24:26] <%Teintstein> pat has been turned into a chair cushion
[0:24:27] <Pakooboomi> looking great peach
[0:24:28] <+Kise77> is there a reason it's 4:3?
[0:24:29] <Valdorick> Dark Spirit Pat defeated - Returning to his world.
[0:24:30] <@MistyMntns> So expensiveee
[0:24:31] <+Jiggisnipe> Call Woolie about his sick camera tech
[0:24:31] <bakkatohri> It could be your computer struggling
[0:24:31] <pav_live> is the camera plugged into a usb 2 port?
[0:24:33] <+Amakuni1> Is this the synder cut?
[0:24:35] <$SirGO0SE> is that Pat
[0:24:37] <Xelhesia> @PeachSaliva what about the aspect ratio?
[0:24:37] <%BinaryFireball> 24 then?
[0:24:39] <Tracazoid> Maybe it needs a restart(the PC).
[0:24:39] <MarylandJutsu> Camera machine broke
[0:24:40] <%SilverJakler> Damn, wish I could get a house
[0:24:42] <%ospreyworks> hmmm
[0:24:42] <%Chichen> @PeachSaliva go into properties on webcam, configure videos, see if theres any checkmarks you can toggle on/off in any of the tabs
[0:24:43] <@MistyMntns> This Stream has been set to 4:3 to keep Peach's origional creative idea.
[0:24:43] <viviknight> stream room needs art
[0:24:45] <udurbalanced> I was hoping for HD Peach squints
[0:24:46] <OhSleepySheepy> I thought you could change that in obs?
[0:24:49] <$Wurmspawn> What's the Bitrate set to?
[0:24:49] <+RealThiele> invite him in then tell him to gtfo your streaming
[0:24:49] <%cervidaequus> Super hi-def paigey
[0:24:50] <$JoshManVGH> Windows fuckery?
[0:24:54] <%Grimlockfly> PAAAAAT, FIIIIIX IIIIIIIT
[0:24:55] <+brothernerofgc> 24 doesnt look bad
[0:24:56] <TuxedoNash> there's screentearing now
[0:24:58] <Zeif00> Is it the cord?
[0:24:59] <$Deadpal> Is the stream itself 60fps or the bitrate not green?
[0:24:59] <WhereIsWill> pat THICC
[0:25:00] <$debugdrawray_> yeah you might wanna check the windows settings for the camera
[0:25:02] <$thomassolorio> he did hit the tv
[0:25:02] <Psyramics> it's weird that all TV is like this and no one minds but a streamer or video game does it and we lose our minds
[0:25:03] <+lethallylactic> HD Paige and Pat PogChamp
[0:25:03] <%Lunarhawk> Could the answer be that Pat's stomach has devoured too many frames
[0:25:03] <%maskofmichael> Don't hit the stolen TV
[0:25:05] <%Kenzo2000> Maybe all the frames are scared of your big strong
[0:25:06] <mr_saturday93> ask pat to twerk on camera
[0:25:06] <%Chichen> yah there is
[0:25:06] <$SirGO0SE> Pat's booster seat LUL
[0:25:06] <Ravioli_Ronin> Are there any interlace settings on the camera or puter?
[0:25:06] <hakumaribo> no there isnt
[0:25:08] <Case_Ah_Dia> @PeachSaliva configure video, low light comp?
[0:25:09] <Namaztak> Put the camera in video mode with the dial on top of it. It's in stills mode right now. That should fix it.
[0:25:11] <rcand9> one guy
[0:25:11] <%Teintstein> I'm not seeing any
[0:25:14] <$SiameseSneeze> no
[0:25:14] <AsterisTV> I have that same seat cushion!
[0:25:14] <PanicSwytch> One Guy
[0:25:15] <EMFole> it has to be recording software at that point no?
[0:25:16] <PleaseCallMeSugar> it's definitely IN 24 fps, there could be some weird windows bullshit going on with it
[0:25:16] <Valdorick> One guying?
[0:25:16] <+zsDirtyHarry> Video seems fine to me
[0:25:20] <Slimeking_Mike> One guy
[0:25:21] <%Lunarhawk> Could you increase bitrate to 10k?
[0:25:21] <dan_g_v> Pat out of focus ?
[0:25:21] <+LordSDB> woolieONEGUY
[0:25:22] <%Kenzo2000> I don't see screen tearing
[0:25:24] <HatingSince87> 4:3 kinda?
[0:25:27] <armchairmaster_> No screen tearing
[0:25:29] <bettysharkface> When is green screen and green screen suit so you can become Jenna Marbles face on videogame characters?
[0:25:29] <+Dunmarkh> that tv belongs to the frienders
[0:25:29] <benjiFG> no screen tearing
[0:25:29] <farrellcityking> They’re lying!
[0:25:31] <BackflipCharm> Remove the mustard from frame that should do it. Please.
[0:25:32] <Shion963> is that the TV with the busted remote, from the podcast?
[0:25:35] <+gogorobotz> oh god, are you two getting a divorce already?
[0:25:35] <extradopeness> Hey you two
[0:25:37] <%rumtumtugnutz> Tethered is no screen tearing
[0:25:37] <samcast1> I can see her emotions.
[0:25:37] <+Fooguwu> Paige has the FPS of some jerky horror monster, like it was meant to be
[0:25:38] <iosephe> focus on pat!
[0:25:38] <Pakooboomi> whats that on the bottom right peach
[0:25:39] <viviknight> Paige is the focus dammit
[0:25:39] <+DJ_Omen> shaky cam engaged!
[0:25:40] <theOG_RB> focus on pat
[0:25:40] <ZComiX> is there anyway to stabalize the camera? it shakes a lot
[0:25:42] <pav_live> try lowering the exposure?
[0:25:42] <bakkatohri> Maybe you're not using a good video codec?
[0:25:42] <Calek> Pat doesn't want to be in HD
[0:25:43] <%Chichen> i like the blurry goblin sneaking in
[0:25:44] <BigBenny805> hi
[0:25:44] <%Marg0Pol0> Paige,  can you edit the shutter speed?
[0:25:44] <$Falilth> is it in a usb3 port?
[0:25:45] <Ravioli_Ronin> Is deinterlacing an option?
[0:25:46] <%Starotter70> Orange Pants
[0:25:46] <duckmeister7> lol is this the zack snyder cut of ruby weapon hour
[0:25:48] <EASrake> That's actually what Pat looks like usually
[0:25:48] <$Wurmspawn> Pat is out of focus because PAt isn't important. :P
[0:25:49] <belliqua> it doesn't even look like 24fps to me, it's closer to 16
[0:25:49] <%Teintstein> pat only exists in SD
[0:25:50] <%RAGING_1NF3RNO> Maybe adjust the exposure. My webcam lowers its framerate when the exposure is too high.
[0:25:50] <+Invlux> He's wearing his sexy fishnets at least
[0:25:50] <$cade_calrayn> Also he's not the focus anyways
[0:25:52] <$Deadpal> Yeah it still looks 24 fps.
[0:25:52] <@Jekado> ELMO!
[0:25:53] <$Kaiser_Loar> is it in video mode in obs
[0:25:53] <aiutare47> They look so fuckin strange not on a couch I can’t get over it
[0:25:54] <+Shockrates20XX> 4:3 resolution to preserve Zach Snyder's vision of Paige's stream.
[0:25:55] <Ell1ot> how are you gonna "Papyrus, do you need anything?"
[0:25:56] <+lethallylactic> Kreygasm
[0:25:56] <+Velociraptor_Cleftes> Have you tried turning Pat off and on again?
[0:25:57] <morningmoondude> I like out of focus Pat, feels like he's been greenscreened into this video
[0:25:59] <Srthunda> is it set to wumbo
[0:26:01] <WhereIsWill> lowering exposure can help with fps
[0:26:01] <%rumtumtugnutz> Ther3 is an out of focus goblin in the background
[0:26:01] <%YakumoYomi> Balls live in the hallway
[0:26:03] <%Monkeyweed21> Did Paige get an office just to read Undertale AU fanfic?
[0:26:03] <%FujoshiCadet> this is like paige vision
[0:26:04] <+RealThiele> i thought they were inside the orb
[0:26:07] <+BettyMwwaahh> get two cameras and merge the fps together @PeachSaliva
[0:26:09] <$arcielardor> your camera is auto-adjusting a lot.
[0:26:11] <%Chichen> Ballway
[0:26:11] <theOG_RB> cant render that far
[0:26:12] <bakkatohri> DAT DEPTH OF FOCUS
[0:26:13] <%walternatorz> Pat, you should go grab your balls.
[0:26:13] <%czeekytv> OMG NEW OFFICE
[0:26:13] <udurbalanced> Pat looks uncomfortable when he's not on the couch
[0:26:13] <%Kenzo2000> Out of focus Pat is a mood
[0:26:14] <+Order_of_Mystery> look at Paige's fancy office! how professional :O
[0:26:16] <jorniev> She is still leveling up her streaming skills
[0:26:16] <TuxedoNash> the ballway
[0:26:17] <+skeletrail> Ah, detached, as i always suspected
[0:26:18] <+Cobaltor_252> I think I prefer background Pat
[0:26:21] <extradopeness> What is that, an EKG monitor?
[0:26:24] <deviljhojho_> 4k saliva
[0:26:25] <%Lunarhawk> Pat's out of focus cause you can't stare too long at an eldritch horror without going insane guys
[0:26:26] <peachy996> So how do the balls travel from the hallway to your ass?
[0:26:27] <+brothernerofgc> it may just need a hard reset after the settings are changed
[0:26:29] <+HiroTSK5> Can actually see the ring in HD
[0:26:29] <+DakotaMacDoodle> Pat is out of his domain there for blurry
[0:26:29] <Ravioli_Ronin> I am a camera man and could maybe help(?) what is the shutter set at?
[0:26:29] <illtima> my therapist "Blurry Pat isn't real, he can't hurt you"
[0:26:31] <%GabeSweetMan> Flail them baby fists to test
[0:26:31] <+smargh1015> why the new set up?
[0:26:33] <+shruke> we already almost see Pat's balls on  his stream
[0:26:33] <+orleavau> damn how are you so pretty
[0:26:33] <$SiameseSneeze> My balls moved to New York FeelsBadMan
[0:26:34] <+ORGANizerC> we're just in cinematic ps3 game mode rn
[0:26:34] <$Wurmspawn> Phrasing!
[0:26:35] <+The_UnfathoMarble> balls to the hall
[0:26:36] <foolishorion> Balls reside on the wall.
[0:26:37] <$SirGO0SE> tighten up the graphics on level 3 yes
[0:26:38] <%SaiyanShoto> Pat looks comfy
[0:26:39] <farrellcityking> Pat has balls? 😲
[0:26:40] <+nowtalks10> Pat isn't out of focus, he just has a natural blur at all times
[0:26:41] <%ergulor> but you're paige you're strong
[0:26:41] <pav_live> try lowering the exposure lol
[0:26:45] <%ospreyworks> OH
[0:26:45] <+WutangchickeN> mount the camera to the wall
[0:26:46] <%KingKrampus> pat is a gnome though, not Eldritch
[0:26:49] <%ospreyworks> that may be it
[0:26:50] <$arcielardor> what kind of capture card are you using?
[0:26:50] <%Marg0Pol0> Yes
[0:26:53] <PleaseCallMeSugar> Could the problem be where the camera is plugged in?
[0:26:53] <HatingSince87> can you guys go 16:9 instead?
[0:26:56] <chestersan> looks rad
[0:26:56] <hearingthenseeing> paige I like your watch
[0:26:56] <%Marg0Pol0> open settings
[0:26:57] <$happyface699> Balls cant be on stream since they are in the hall
[0:27:00] <ZComiX> when the camera isnt shaking the FPS looks good. the shaking might be effecting how the FPS looks
[0:27:00] <%Chichen> configure video settings in OBS properties
[0:27:02] <+boxboten> it feels like pat is greenscreened in back there and its making me uncomfortable
[0:27:02] <%MechArch> Pat looks like a dad back there
[0:27:03] <%ospreyworks> Shutter speed may be it
[0:27:06] <@commanderclaw> Paige is always exposed, we've seen her Baba gameplay
[0:27:12] <$SirGO0SE> you can raise the exposure by taking your pants off Pat \
[0:27:14] <jacobknight13> try telling the camera its handsome
[0:27:20] <Foaminghammer> @peachsaliva after you applied the settings try restarting the stream? obs might just be acting up
[0:27:22] <+orleavau> is this a usb camera?
[0:27:23] <EMFole> Shutter would affect motion blur rather than framerate no?
[0:27:24] <%RedPanda25> Become a Vtuber
[0:27:26] <$cade_calrayn> Pat is a dad, he's got two sweet sons
[0:27:27] <viviknight> everything looks fine when the camera isn't being abused
[0:27:30] <$happyface699> Paige is da broken
[0:27:30] <$Auctorian> cheer200 of course there's mustard. Why wouldn't there be mustard?
[0:27:36] <%Marg0Pol0> oh god, Paige you need to fix it on the cam I think
[0:27:38] <DisneylandPimp> is that a cutout of Pat?
[0:27:40] <$arcielardor> it stopped adjusting at least.
[0:27:41] <Case_Ah_Dia> have you checked low light compensation in your OBS? @PeachSaliva
[0:27:42] <udurbalanced> After the lethal greatwood facesitting I feel we've seen Peach at highest exposure
[0:27:48] <LifesNeverHumDrum> yeah it's not the framerate, it's the shutterrate of the camera, p sre
[0:27:48] <Melchior_the_Wise> Everything looks too clear and real...
[0:27:50] <theoneGalen> wow, I don't think I've ever seen Paige's face in such resolution before
[0:27:51] <$SirGO0SE> wait did she say a6400?
[0:27:51] <bettysharkface> Give the camera smooches, tell it "at least you tried, camera"
[0:27:52] <Ravioli_Ronin> If you’re at 60fps, try putting the shutter at 1/120 speed
[0:27:53] <farrellcityking> Hug and kiss the computer and whisper sweet nothings in it’s USB
[0:27:57] <%Chichen> @PeachSaliva try adjusting exposure in configure video in properties. Also turning on/off any check marked settings. Might help.
[0:28:05] <+guyalex> you're too in focus, my fight or flight response is activating
[0:28:05] <SaphronBlackbourne> Reminder your jawline is gr8 and I wish I had it, my face is WEAK and BABY

[0:28:37] <%Spirit_hz> It doesn't look bad
[0:28:38] <$Deadpal> I'd say try a lower resolution. If she's stremaing in 4k it ONLY can do 30fps.
[0:28:39] <$cade_calrayn> Not the MARRIAGE TITTY
[0:28:39] <%Teintstein> 45
[0:28:39] <+Velociraptor_Cleftes> The issue could be related to the camera design - it might not be used to capturing beautiful men and women

[0:28:53] <$Wurmspawn> I mean, fast motions are a bit blury, but frankly you it still looks great to me. Just saying.
[0:28:53] <%ospreyworks> 60 fps should have shutter speed of 125
[0:28:54] <pav_live> there should be an adjust video button below the deactivate camera button

[0:30:17] <Top_Lane_Duelist> but it could be on BETTER video
[0:30:17] <Ravioli_Ronin> Yeah, shutter should be double the frame rate, so 1/120 shutter speed might help; if not that, it kinda looks like footage I’ve dealt with before deinterlacing, but idk if that’s something that can be adjusted in camera
[0:30:20] <%TigerCatGo> Just came back from dinner and I SEE A MUSTARD BOTTLE ALREADY

[0:33:15] <heartlesshealer> Pat needs to stay in unoptimized hell to contrast with woolie on the podcast
[0:33:23] <ragasquid> the lighting is fucking with me psychologically
[0:33:44] <%CopperTucker> is the audio wobbling for anyone else?
[0:33:44] <$cade_calrayn> We need a high def Elmo cam, that's the most important thing
[0:33:50] <@SoFarFetched> Yeah audio is fucky for me too
[0:33:50] <balthazar758> 1k souls witnessing a dumpster
[0:33:53] <%Kenzo2000> Audio seems fine for me
[0:33:54] <@SoFarFetched> I did a refresh and still fucky
[0:33:54] <Namaztak> I'm out of channel points to keep highlighting my messages, but I have a Sony A7SII and the exact same capture card for it
[0:34:02] <+Stormzcales_Lair> damn now i gotta watch this show this coming sat morning
[0:34:03] <@Jekado> ??? whats going on with the sound?
[0:34:06] <$Arazien> audio fine
[0:34:08] <+Running_Sets> Yes hi hello
[0:34:09] <belliqua> the audio sounds fine to me?
[0:34:16] <@SoFarFetched> maybe if I refresh one more time geefThink
[0:34:17] <peachy996> @CopperTucker sometimes you have to refresh it, it's a twitch issue
[0:34:17] <OneThousandTomatoes> in getting no audio issues
[0:34:23] <farrellcityking> Is that a picture of skeleton Liam?
[0:34:27] <%SuckerPunchSyd> Same for me? Audio seems fine
[0:34:31] <LifesNeverHumDrum> still got audio and i have fucky internet
[0:34:36] <@SoFarFetched> Okay now I fixed it with 3 refreshes.
[0:34:38] <$cade_calrayn> @farrellcityking that Steve Buscelmo
[0:34:39] <%KingKrampus> @stormzcales_lair which show this Saturday
[0:34:47] <$JoshManVGH> @sofarfetched Have you tried turning it of and on again again...again?
[0:34:49] <%SuckerPunchSyd> Though i have had it be wobbly on some past streams about a year back
[0:34:51] <Burny01> so I missed some things whats up
[0:34:52] <@SoFarFetched> actually yes
[0:34:53] <Ravioli_Ronin> One day we’ll cure cancer and colonize other planets, but we’ll never get our AV equipment to just fucking work
[0:34:54] <@SoFarFetched> LUL
[0:34:55] <+Sargonyx> From the Sony FAQ site: "For smooth movement, try (Auto Mode) instead of movie mode." Also says you may need to download their "Imaging Edge Webcam" software
[0:35:00] <Bluerose09> could the stream be muted for you?
[0:35:00] <@SoFarFetched> CAuse refreshing it once still made the audio wonky
[0:35:03] <$sumrand0> Just got here: is this still a dumpster fire? hope I'm not too late ×
[0:35:05] <@SoFarFetched> but refreshing it a few more times made it work.
[0:35:05] <%g0atmeal> g0atmeal subscribed with Prime. They've subscribed for 16 months! A test stream? But I didn't study...
[0:35:05] <%samTUMZlettuce> <3 Chat. Hope everyone is good.
[0:35:15] <Slimeking_Mike> Audios fine for me
[0:35:24] <Dakuu75> watching this animation makes me wonder "how many times has Paige, legit needed a cast in her life?" lol
[0:35:25] <%Kenzo2000> Oh man if this turns out to be missing a firmware update or something
[0:35:28] <farrellcityking> Steve Buskelmo is awesome
[0:35:29] <%linSP> linSP subscribed with Prime. They've subscribed for 9 months! hey paige! i love all your stories of gief being cute with strangers on walks. my akita's way of being friendly is pouncing on them! unfortunately he was never socialized as a baby thanks to corporate puppy mills, support adoptions!
[0:35:30] <shadowslygaming> you could have a cold one and wait for it all to blow over
[0:35:31] <Burny01> can anyone explain whats up
[0:35:39] <%Kenzo2000> test streams
[0:35:41] <@SoFarFetched> @Burny01 changing c amera settings
[0:35:46] <%vexion_smh> testing and fixin
[0:35:47] <@SoFarFetched> This is all audio/video set up
[0:35:53] <Shion963> @burny01 just a test stream, see how the new set up worls
[0:35:55] <$JoshManVGH> Camera us being messed with to address framerate issues.
[0:35:59] <@SoFarFetched> so probably no gameplay unless she wants to test that out today.
[0:36:06] <%shurtal> Test stream, no date, AND THE PROM'S TOMORROW
[0:36:22] <Dakuu75> I mean, Pat is there, I assume he'll fix it.
[0:36:23] <%Kenzo2000> Wah
[0:36:23] <$sumrand0> Paige is setting things?!?!?!?!
[0:36:24] <@SoFarFetched> yeah we can
[0:36:24] <Shion963> and all my teeth fell out oh nooo

[0:36:33] <JustYudha> Lmfao
[0:36:33] <%CommanderSqueaks> wah
[0:36:33] <%Kenzo2000> ISO is kinda like brightness
[0:36:33] <osaka_daioh> GREAT
[0:36:34] <EMFole> i have a feeling the settings on the camera are fine as long as it is set to 60fps capture, I would imagine it has something to do with OBS settings or maybe a missing piece of software on the PC to connect it right
[0:36:34] <heartlesshealer> video yes, audio yes
[0:36:34] <justcallmebobplease> PAIGE
[0:36:34] <udurbalanced> It's mood lighting

[0:36:36] <$AzureGale> We can see and hear you
[0:36:36] <+crazyspartan214> lag is still there
[0:36:37] <%Chichen> no
[0:36:37] <Djinnazz> Still better
[0:36:38] <samcast1> Have you checked the shutter fluid?
[0:36:38] <%cervidaequus> Wuh wuh wuh wuh wuh
[0:36:38] <farrellcityking> Pats way of fixing the camera is rubbing it on the orb. Sorta like Flight of the Navigator.
[0:36:39] <Lutre> LUL
[0:36:39] <extradopeness> Wah!
[0:36:40] <ToneBacas> no
[0:36:40] <moonmintparadise> looks good
[0:36:40] <Calek> the same
[0:36:42] <+Jiggisnipe> looks good
[0:36:43] <belliqua> nope, 24fps
[0:36:43] <stardustno1r> looks good!
[0:36:44] <%czeekytv> just darker
[0:36:44] <@CoalSavoie> ISO wouldn't fix the inherent problem
[0:36:44] <nimu290> hi peach
[0:36:44] <BackflipCharm> Paige on a quest to make her stream as broken as she is.
[0:36:44] <+Cobaltor_252> its the same
[0:36:45] <LifesNeverHumDrum> cool. and your shutter rate is still bad
[0:36:45] <PartyFavors> wah, also pat basks in the shadows as the evil vizier
[0:36:45] <$arcielardor> yes
[0:36:45] <%BRBN310> lag
[0:36:45] <+DakotaMacDoodle> same
[0:36:46] <%holydeviant1> "i DON'T KNOW WHAT'S HAPPENING" is the eternal state of this stream
[0:36:47] <marvel877> SAME
[0:36:47] <+RevolverOcelot16> Good
[0:36:48] <NocturneNovember> Holy shit, Paige are you in 4k or something?
[0:36:48] <%Teintstein> same but slightly darker lol
[0:36:49] <%CommanderSqueaks> Shutter fluid.
[0:36:49] <morningmoondude> different but it's nice
[0:36:50] <peachy996> Yeah its okay
[0:36:50] <ragasquid> still 24fps
[0:36:51] <%Kenzo2000> Oh my God
[0:36:52] <+gogorobotz> who's there? it's so dark!
[0:36:52] <%BRBN310> stutter
[0:36:52] <%Divryne> I can't believe I'm looking at 30 FPS IRL.
[0:36:53] <+KellBeII> looks better, the light was too bright before
[0:36:53] <blkalucard1> lol
[0:36:54] <+Invlux> ISO is "film sensitivity"
[0:36:54] <+Ancopro> ohno
[0:36:54] <%cervidaequus> Back in the dungeon now
[0:36:55] <bakkatohri> ISO just affects light sensitivity.
[0:36:57] <$happyface699> I like it
[0:36:57] <%Teintstein> same but different
[0:36:57] <hookycookie> Paige gone dark
[0:36:57] <%samTUMZlettuce> Folded Arms
[0:36:58] <%YourFavoriteShiba> Honestly it's all good. People are just being picky.
[0:36:58] <$cade_calrayn> Look at Pat's smirk in the background
[0:37:00] <Namaztak> ISO is the light sensitivity. Higher number go brighter, but image gets noisier.
[0:37:00] <SGrim> You look like you're a stop-motion clay animation.
[0:37:00] <$thomassolorio> hahahahahahaha awww baby im sorry
[0:37:00] <%czeekytv> shutter fluid is definitely the problem
[0:37:02] <Piemono> Time to go back to the Elmo overlay
[0:37:03] <PleaseCallMeSugar> "oh you have to change the shutter fluid"
[0:37:03] <%SilvaChariot0133> high res, low frames
[0:37:03] <Ravioli_Ronin> ISO is the camera sensors sensitivity to light
[0:37:05] <+SveriSageAdvice> the resolution is high as hell
[0:37:05] <+Mr_Pylon> 4:3 4k
[0:37:06] <%SuckerPunchSyd> I honestly cant tell
[0:37:06] <$Deadpal> the device CANNOT DO 60FPS 4K.
[0:37:07] <+TheotherKristian> Yo, no stress, take your time, chill, we understand.
[0:37:07] <%Marg0Pol0> yes
[0:37:08] <Dakuu75> @PeachSaliva you could try screen capturing so we could see the camera's settings
[0:37:08] <theoneGalen> you're WAY in 4K
[0:37:10] <+NWR_James> Change the camera's oil. it might be low
[0:37:10] <+luftraumm1> iso should be auto
[0:37:11] <KikioJane> The resolution is amazing
[0:37:12] <+vascillia> @PeachSaliva 4:3 window frame? is zack snyder directing your streams now?
[0:37:12] <+guyalex> yeah just replace that shutter fluid, lube it up
[0:37:12] <+whyskeywolfe> Paige have you tried draining the server grease?
[0:37:13] <Madovir> PAIGE 8k REAL
[0:37:15] <+terraspan> yeah. gross
[0:37:15] <Broken_Sonex> How many people here really care?
[0:37:15] <+Wool> What FPS is OBS set to
[0:37:16] <%CommanderSqueaks> .... Shutter fluid.
[0:37:16] <$sumrand0> ALL OF YOUR PORES R BELONG 2 US
[0:37:17] <graemecrackers2> Change the Shutter fluid
[0:37:19] <$arcielardor> 4k at 15 frames per second
[0:37:20] <LifesNeverHumDrum> HEADLIGHT fluid???
[0:37:20] <+KaitoTheRamenBandit> I thought Pat was in a wheelchair like Stephen Hawking
[0:37:21] <$JoshManVGH> Same framerate but you look like you exist in the same space as the rest of your room.
[0:37:22] <%Lunarhawk> Paige you should replace your hands with robo hands to solve that problem
[0:37:22] <morglea> Paige, please don't listen to shutter fluid
[0:37:26] <DannyMcgee> You need to buy shutter fluid form the store.
[0:37:27] <viviknight> shutter fluid sounds made up
[0:37:28] <@SoFarFetched> Paige you got nice lady fingers you hush geefPlz
[0:37:30] <heartlesshealer> Paige in 4k, weird speed visuals happening, dimness looks more haunted spooky game night
[0:37:30] <%BRBN310> test stream dont worry
[0:37:32] <%Starotter70> Get new windshield juice?
[0:37:33] <bettysharkface> Shutter fluid is like headlight fluid.
[0:37:34] <+McSoliace> its a test will live Paige
[0:37:34] <%CommanderSqueaks> Paige, think about this for a second. Shutter FLUID?
[0:37:34] <Pookiedaexzile> You gotta have pat spit on the lense
[0:37:34] <$happyface699> Paige is become HD
[0:37:36] <$Mopopolis> LUL
[0:37:36] <EMFole> honestly this ISO looks slightly better to me
[0:37:37] <+dunesofrage> This is a good time
[0:37:37] <Ravioli_Ronin> Did you change the shutter speed to 1/120?
[0:37:38] <Case_Ah_Dia> low light compensation on OBS? turn it off
[0:37:40] <Maids4lyfe> it's next to the elbow grease
[0:37:42] <%AyotoCorp> Doesn't the Camlink only support 4k30
[0:37:43] <@CoalSavoie> ISO affects your brightness without altering shutter speed. It gives you more grain. Shutter speed down = darker, but smoother
[0:37:43] <$cade_calrayn> Paige it's amazing you got this all set up yourself, you're just panicking under pressure!
[0:37:43] <Namaztak> Don't go to BRB, just do these changes live so we can help you while you state exactly what you're touching.
[0:37:44] <+vascillia> I kinda hope pat doesn't help at all and she just has to figure it out
[0:37:45] <+crazyspartan214> let just play as it is and fix off stream
[0:37:45] <Shion963> this the Paige we know and love
[0:37:46] <%Marg0Pol0> Paige it probably has to go to default
[0:37:47] <+Felremi> wait pat is married now?
[0:37:50] <bakkatohri> Check OBS. OBS gives you options to choose your maximum FPS.
[0:37:50] <LifesNeverHumDrum> blindfold go back on
[0:37:50] <+doctoroculat> im not used to seeing these gingers in 4k

[0:38:11] <+Jiggisnipe> Paige Will Figure It Out... maybe
[0:38:14] <How2BEpic> paige has to give the camera some of her fluid

[0:38:56] <farrellcityking> Paige, you have to recalibrate the throttle and digitize the gas nozzle
[0:38:57] <%CommanderSqueaks> 24 hour test stream let's go.
[0:39:00] <%mikehuntis4timmy> mikehuntis4timmy subscribed with Prime. They've subscribed for 3 months! yo mustard is pretty gross mayonnaise is better

[0:39:10] <Dakuu75> @PeachSaliva maybe tell us the brand/model of camera. so we can google the PDF manual and shit, on our end?
[0:39:13] <+mach0n4cho> did she accidentally show her butt or something
[0:39:13] <+tweedler92> It's like the Dragon Age stream all over again LUL
[0:39:17] <Virokwet> ratJAMS
[0:39:17] <TheZearGuy> Have you tried hitting the camera? That works with my computer.
[0:39:19] <%Kenzo2000> Did you know you can make your own shutter fluid with two parts motor oil and one part mustard?
[0:39:19] <rcand9> woolieACCIDENT
[0:39:22] <%BoxNavy> i fell asleep during pats stream and now im just here moon22 moon22 wuh happon
[0:39:27] <Ravioli_Ronin> You have to fill the camera with enough pixelbites for it to get enough mileage
[0:39:28] <PleaseCallMeSugar> mayonnaise on french fries gang rise up but not too quickly because your circulation is kinda bad and you might hurt yourself
[0:39:29] <$sumrand0> Get hype for the next "Paige update" what is she gonna "fix" next???
[0:39:31] <stardustno1r> is the shutter dehydrated?
[0:39:31] <+zamatermort> This is such a shitshow, I love it
[0:39:35] <%AyotoCorp> Wait is the camera in 4k?  That might be the problem.

[0:39:47] <%Kenzo2000> PLeas archive this
[0:39:49] <%Marg0Pol0> Paige I just want to say that this is a bit annoying as a viewer who understands this stuff, but it's less annoying than Pat spending hours doing his "Photoshoping" experiment on Twitter
[0:39:49] <Dr_Mooose> we'll do it live!
[0:39:49] <graemecrackers2> No worries
[0:39:49] <+Wool> what FPS is OBS set to?

[0:41:02] <+red_cuppa> poor thing
[0:41:02] <VirtuaRailith> virtua88Horfo
[0:41:03] <+crazyspartan214> BallerSwagBro. you got work to do
[0:41:06] <heartlesshealer> This is why you labeled it "Test Stream". It's OKAY to take time with your tech stuff!
[0:41:09] <+PirateKefka> I wouldn't be surprised if that's the issue because I just got a 4KTV and hooked up my Pi and the TV wanted it to output in 4K and the Pi sure as fuck couldn't handle it lol
[0:41:11] <danpc5> got an attitudeee
[0:41:11] <Lutre> this music is gonna still be playing as I get hauled away in a straightjacket
[0:41:12] <%Kenzo2000> HE'S THE FASTEST THING ALIIIIIYYEEEEIIIIIIVE
[0:41:13] <CrisLeFortl> a drink for each brb
[0:41:15] <%crowlord4> I honestly think it will be at least another 2-3 years before i switch to 4k. I just dont need to, my 580 works fine and the gpu market is a nightmare. Plus id rather put my money towards guitars that im bad at
[0:41:17] <peachy996> Spot the Pat in this picture on the sofa
[0:41:19] <ttc_lover> I work with cameras, what’s the problem you’re trying to fix?
[0:41:19] <%samTUMZlettuce> Ugly ass boots...
[0:41:19] <bettysharkface> Yeah they needed to play Paige's "cover" of this for this stream.
[0:41:23] <Dakuu75> @PeachSaliva you literally have "jsut chatting" set as your twitch category and we all know what we came here for. No need to panic.
[0:41:28] <DiscoMatador> @farrellcityking You shut your Dirty Mouth
[0:41:31] <%samTUMZlettuce> Kappa They're lovely.
[0:41:33] <bakkatohri> I think you might need an especially beefy computer to stream 4k at 60fps, right?
[0:41:35] <%samTUMZlettuce> LUL
[0:41:35] <$sumrand0> So glad I'm here to catch this train wreck live 😂❤
[0:41:38] <BigLoserJosh> A stream to surpass Dragon Age Inquisition
[0:41:41] <Virokwet> CurseLit sipsipHellmo CurseLit
[0:41:45] <OneThousandTomatoes> doing a test stream at all is already more professional than some
[0:41:49] <LifesNeverHumDrum> @farrellcityking you are WEAK, but Zangeif is STRONG
[0:41:50] <Ravioli_Ronin> 1080p, 60fps, 1/120 shutter, adjust ISO until your brightness is where you want it, and providing there’s no weird cap card issues, bingo bango your in business
[0:41:54] <+razielhex> peepee water
[0:41:54] <$Deadpal> @bakkatohri she has one, sony is the problem here. they don't ALLOW 60fps 4k.
[0:42:03] <+crazyspartan214> This is the Paige version of HOLD ON.
[0:42:04] <farrellcityking> No way! That dog is a stream killer. At least for me. Have to turn every stream off once he starts
[0:42:08] <Calek> 4k 60fps is of the devil
[0:42:14] <%ElkRiverDog> lomPanic
[0:42:21] <LifesNeverHumDrum> that sounds like a "you" problem my man
[0:42:21] <%cervidaequus> @farrellcityking then leave, nobody will miss you
[0:42:24] <balthazar758> oh man
[0:42:24] <+doctoroculat> got up to pee, didnt miss anything
[0:42:25] <+razielhex> and WACKdonalds
[0:42:30] <heartlesshealer> Have you been around animals ever??????
[0:42:38] <PartyFavors> Has the sonic fandom made any fangames with the freedom fighters more complex than "you can play as Bunnie in Sonic 2"? Because that's what continuously hearing this track makes me think about
[0:42:40] <Virokwet> @farrellcityking feel bad for ya dude
[0:42:42] <%DiscoMatador> @farrellcityking Its because you lack POWER
[0:42:51] <Ravioli_Ronin> I wanna say a lot of SLRs don’t let you do 4K/60fps for some reason, which is wild
[0:43:03] <$Auctorian> Lol
[0:43:04] <LifesNeverHumDrum> just stream in 144p
[0:43:04] <$sumrand0> WE DID IT
[0:43:07] <%samTUMZlettuce> There we go :)
[0:43:08] <@SoFarFetched> @farrellcityking these streams are probably not for you cause Gief is usually in them.

[0:46:37] <%CantWalkGood> good!
[0:46:37] <BackflipCharm> Sound's good but there's a high pitched annoying noise whenever Pat speaks. Kappa
[0:46:38] <JohnClaggart> sound is a bit echoey without the foams up
[0:46:38] <EMFole> sounds fine with slight echo but you have foam in the back it looks like
[0:46:39] <%SilvaChariot0133> just the slight visual desync
[0:46:39] <+Wandor__> Sounds good but I'm on a beastly computer and the frametime is bad
[0:46:39] <%Spirit_hz> Its pretty clear
[0:46:39] <Calek> sound is fantastic

[0:46:44] <+SteamyLinguini64> Sounds a little echoey but good
[0:46:44] <%YourFavoriteShiba> for real real not for play play
[0:46:46] <TheZearGuy> Sounds good

[0:46:49] <%Ranryu692> the Bathroom stream
[0:46:50] <@Jekado> drape the back ground of the room
[0:46:52] <%BoxNavy> yes
[0:46:52] <@Jekado> or that works
[0:46:52] <$Mopopolis> If you are worried about echo, move the mic closer
[0:46:53] <%Teintstein> yeeee
[0:46:54] <Lutre> sound is good, any room echo you can fix eith decorations or a small amount of foam
[0:46:54] <StarkAvKnark> 4:3 to preserve the creative vision
[0:46:54] <ttc_lover> Set the mode dial to M, then the shutter speed and aperture should be changeable with the dials
[0:46:58] <%GabeSweetMan> Much softproofing
[0:46:58] <$cade_calrayn> Pat is absorbing all the noise
[0:46:58] <+Cobaltor_252> background noise is very apparant but you sound great
[0:46:59] <%cervidaequus> Only a tiny room noise but very good sound
[0:47:00] <+The_Kilometers> not much different than the other setup really
[0:47:00] <rcand9> no longer bathroom stream
[0:47:01] <Freddy253> !uptime
[0:47:01] <%samTUMZlettuce> Eggs?!
[0:47:01] <extradopeness> welcome to the real man’s world
[0:47:02] <+barrakuta371> Might want to put up some carpet or avoustic foam for the reverb, but sounds fine otherwise.
[0:47:03] <%Spirit_hz> with a tad of eco
[0:47:03] <CappuccinoGuil> Very little reverb.
[0:47:05] <%samTUMZlettuce> Oh sorry
[0:47:05] <hookycookie> It’s working
[0:47:06] <$sumrand0> FBtouchdown
[0:47:07] <Aquaczaz> you'll just have to get some acoustic foam up on the other walls yeah
[0:47:07] <Xelhesia> gief is practicing his pot buster
[0:47:08] <Shion963> oh yeah Outriders surprised me with how echoey it was
[0:47:09] <+bromontana> turn a game on to test reverb
[0:47:10] <+Basilias_Maximus> Sounds good, but you should test with game audio running. @PeachSaliva
[0:47:10] <%Spirit_hz> yeah that will help some
[0:47:10] <%BoxNavy> fart with reverb
[0:47:12] <%SuckerPunchSyd> How do you set those up?
[0:47:15] <+BettyMwwaahh> bring the reverb back
[0:47:18] <%jarednotwithsubway> buheh
[0:47:20] <peachy996> Wearing Headphones and while it's a little echo-y, the audio is good
[0:47:21] <+doctoroculat> BibleThump
[0:47:22] <Coystick> PUUT
[0:47:23] <+razielhex> PeachSaliva Peloton workout streams in 4k when?
[0:47:23] <+RandyFistburgers> pat do a bathroom stream
[0:47:24] <$happyface699> Fluffy wall posters
[0:47:26] <Ravioli_Ronin> “Connect the blue wire to where the red wire goes on the board”
[0:47:26] <Mr_JustinJones> Please mic up Gief
[0:47:29] <@Jekado> you can also have a green screen drape behind you to absorb more sound
[0:47:33] <LifesNeverHumDrum> honestly the reverb isn't too bad with your vocal pitch, so.
[0:47:33] <aiutare47> Puhat
[0:47:33] <%maskofmichael> Why does Geif want to eat chair?
[0:47:33] <$Kaiser_Loar> sounds good not a lot of reverb
[0:47:36] <JohnClaggart> arent you supposed to put foam up behind you first?
[0:47:38] <%baronblank> bring back the reverb and play melty blood to simulate evo bathroom
[0:47:40] <@commanderclaw> Is there a menu on the screen on the back of it?
[0:47:46] <ttc_lover> Set the mode dial to M, then the shutter speed and aperture should be changeable with the dials. Shutter to 1/120 if in 1080 60p
[0:47:48] <EMFole> maybe test what game FPS looks like to see if its the cam settings or the stream settings?
[0:47:49] <%PinkertonDanPie> bc he a puppy
[0:47:51] <@Jekado> tasty tasty chair!
[0:47:54] <ToneBacas> refresh obs video source

[0:48:37] <+HiroTSK5> Did you reset computer?
[0:48:39] <$TIME_PUNCHER> love the Snyder cut aspect ratio
[0:48:44] <+KorieTheCoward> So are you setting up for 2 different stream rooms?

[0:49:08] <@commanderclaw> This stream is presented in   4:3 to preserve Peach Saliva's artistic direction
[0:49:09] <+Tuba_Anon> OMG your office looks amazing!
[0:49:09] <%PinkertonDanPie> bruh
[0:49:14] <+RandyFistburgers> ngl, just finished a pita genetics exam today, nice to have strem to hang out in now
[0:49:16] <+bromontana> The Phantom Chew
[0:49:16] <DannyMcgee> You need to set it to W for Wumbo then.
[0:49:16] <stardustno1r> for the acoustic, you could also cover the walls with egg cartons, that helps
[0:49:17] <cobalt_phoenix_> I just showed up and I see gief and a bottle of mustard I love this setup already
[0:49:18] <Shion963> do it
[0:49:19] <+SteamyLinguini64> ew boobs
[0:49:20] <+Dunmarkh> fuck
[0:49:21] <+OrangeMDT> Why is this FPS even a problem... It’s fine
[0:49:21] <belliqua> you're wearing a high neck t-shirt
[0:49:22] <blkalucard1> no do it tho
[0:49:22] <@SoFarFetched> ESPECIALLY the marriage titty
[0:49:23] <%samTUMZlettuce> When you need that extra little push over the edge?
[0:49:23] <mr_saturday93> grandma bewbs
[0:49:23] <Ravioli_Ronin> Honestly the index in the manual would probably be the best help as far as finding out how to change specific settings, since we can’t see
[0:49:24] <rcand9> @sporeian94 how is that no offence?

[0:54:01] <Tracazoid> It wants to focus on the Patorb
[0:54:03] <+SveriSageAdvice> it is definitely a smoother framerate at this point
[0:54:03] <+kumaprime> wait, this is what you look like!? lol jk
[0:54:04] <$Tetrapony> Holy shoe is this HD stream?
[0:54:04] <Neo_Kaiser> Has Paige banged out Dark Souls 3 over the summer yet?
[0:54:04] <Sotetsu> Hi Pat! I like your pajama pants.
[0:54:05] <+flexin_apex> Pat is blurry
[0:54:05] <%GabeSweetMan> Auto focus is going nuts
[0:54:07] <%ThomasOfTroy> It's kinda freaking out
[0:54:08] <Ravioli_Ronin> Oh my gaaaaaaaaaaaahd
[0:54:08] <How2BEpic> it's a test stream. We could keep going.
[0:54:10] <+drk_sd> ON THE CAMERA DISPLAY THERE SHOULD BE A SETTING THAT LOOKS LIKE 1/24 CHANGE IT TO 1/60
[0:54:10] <PleaseCallMeSugar> OH GOD THE FOCUS
[0:54:10] <%SilvaChariot0133> it's FINE just a TINY bit delayed
[0:54:11] <%Kenzo2000> Paige, you can;t see
[0:54:11] <LifesNeverHumDrum> the fluids has gone bad!
[0:54:11] <+RandyFistburgers> looks like 20fps
[0:54:12] <@Jekado> oh wow thats a weird auto focus
[0:54:13] <VirtuaRailith> shrink the feed
[0:54:13] <%samTUMZlettuce> Wait, it is focus shifting.
[0:54:13] <+Dunmarkh> holy fuck that autofocus
[0:54:13] <belliqua> oh god that autofocus is unbearable
[0:54:14] <$RueOrin> Ooooohhh no it IS choppy
[0:54:15] <%PinkertonDanPie> it fine
[0:54:15] <+twohitgood> it does look choppy.
[0:54:15] <count_bob> ahh autofocus.

[0:54:16] <%vexion_smh> woah
[0:54:16] <+Gespens> oh god the autofocus
[0:54:16] <%BoxNavy> WutFace the autofocus is going wild
[0:54:16] <+razielhex> teh blurring and auto-focus
[0:54:17] <Bluerose09> too much auto focus
[0:54:17] <+Take_2_shots> Pat is naturally blurry
[0:54:17] <%Spirit_hz> It looks just fine
[0:54:18] <+SteamyLinguini64> Pat is phasing in and out of existance
[0:54:19] <WhereIsWill> super auto focus now
[0:54:20] <PanicSwytch> Auto focus is going wild
[0:54:20] <$sumrand0> You're like an anime character STRIKE A POSE
[0:54:21] <+ghostfaceninja_> the goal is to tune the setup
[0:54:21] <dots4eyes> Blurry Pat is fine
[0:54:21] <%Teintstein> the auto focus is going to give me a migraine
[0:54:21] <DannyMcgee> It's not silky smooth, but it seems fine.
[0:54:21] <Dakuu75> @PeachSaliva you could try searching on youtube or google "<camera model> low fps" and see what comes up
[0:54:21] <+boxboten> make pat blurrier
[0:54:22] <+PirateKefka> Pat has always been non-euclidian
[0:54:24] <%crowlord4> Yo the framerates lookin better but you're lookin like you're phasing in and out
[0:54:25] <%Marg0Pol0> You should turn autofocus off
[0:54:26] <Srthunda> with a snap of the fingers, the auto focus attacks
[0:54:26] <karovus> the framerate looks much better than when the stream started
[0:54:27] <Shacklebox> I'm not here for pat
[0:54:29] <%vexion_smh> Autofocus going wild
[0:54:31] <%samTUMZlettuce> I've seen pat screen tear.
[0:54:31] <+mecha_11> OH MY GOSH IT LOOKS FINE
[0:54:31] <heartlesshealer> Use the Smear tool on Pat
[0:54:31] <mongorific> autofocus is losing it's goddamn mind
[0:54:32] <%BoxNavy> do it
[0:54:33] <KaiserMario> Gief on TV!
[0:54:35] <$Tetrapony> thats too HD paige
[0:54:37] <Ravioli_Ronin> Yeah this is def better than before
[0:54:38] <@SoFarFetched> you need to be VERY specific step by step
[0:54:38] <bob900000> goo goo ga ga
[0:54:39] <%vdalson> did the camera come with a manual
[0:54:39] <Jaxnos> oh, is it supposed to blur the background and it can't handle multiple people at different distances?
[0:54:43] <peachy996> How do
[0:54:44] <+Invlux> Someone make a graphic and DM them on twitter
[0:54:45] <%crowlord4> Check the stream, framerates lookin smoother
[0:54:46] <%Kenzo2000> He's a big star
[0:54:48] <Broken_Sonex> @PeachSaliva I'm see you clearly, you're in cinque with your audio, i forgot what the problem was.
[0:54:49] <%Teintstein> frame-rate does seem slightly better actually
[0:54:49] <+Kindan55> pray the low frames away
[0:54:49] <+Dunmarkh> just do it nike logo
[0:54:50] <%samTUMZlettuce> "Explain to him, as you would a child." - Galaxy Quest
[0:54:51] <%Lunarhawk> Guys PLEASE just go watch the 24 minute tutorial for this camera someone put on youtube lmao
[0:54:51] <%BoxNavy> dont help them look at the funny dog
[0:54:52] <%GabeSweetMan> Goo-goo-gah-gah level tutorials
[0:54:52] <%PrincessAlex23> oh no it's struggling to figure out which ginger to focus on, this is terrrrrible
[0:54:52] <PanicSwytch> How do
[0:54:54] <+Wandor__> Send PMs to that person
[0:54:55] <VirtuaRailith> Gief sees himself in the tv
[0:54:55] <%CommanderSqueaks> You definitely need to have the manual open for this.
[0:54:55] <%YourFavoriteShiba> The frame rate is fine. People are just being picky.
[0:54:55] <+RandyFistburgers> what camera and program are you using?
[0:54:55] <belliqua> whatever it was set to before M, whatever you just changed, change it back. this is way worse
[0:54:56] <Arweynn> dig up stuid
[0:54:56] <faithless_zealot> He prolly can't say cause it's slow mode
[0:54:57] <leinadtonu> Pat should be censored like in those javs
[0:54:58] <EMFole> kinda hard to describe instructions through a twitch chat with 1100 people in it
[0:54:58] <+flexin_apex> With hands
[0:54:58] <dots4eyes> Do tech support good
[0:55:01] <%Shotgun_Hobo1> Let Gief fix the camera
[0:55:03] <toomanygnome> Use the wheels on the camera to adjust
[0:55:03] <EASrake> try something, rather than nothing.
[0:55:03] <morglea> It's either a knob or a scroll wheel
[0:55:04] <iosephe> make frame rate go up
[0:55:04] <+BettyMwwaahh> how old are these two?
[0:55:05] <Sotetsu> Wow, that is a nice camera. Looks great.
[0:55:06] <%ospreyworks> Is Ashley Roboto online to help?
[0:55:06] <So_I_Started_Blasting> Zangief just staring at himself
[0:55:07] <+Kise77> it looks better to me
[0:55:08] <$Mopopolis> are you able to tweet out the settings page that you can see?
[0:55:09] <How2BEpic> low framerate, and autofocus
[0:55:10] <Veros_Veros> Did you try apologizing to Abraham Lincoln??
[0:55:10] <%Kenzo2000> choppy frames and autofocus
[0:55:12] <ZComiX> it looks fine
[0:55:13] <+SteamyLinguini64> Someone make a slideshow for grandma Paige please
[0:55:14] <%crowlord4> Now you're phasing in and out of focus
[0:55:15] <+Rolandknight> Honestly it really doesn't matter since you will be small.
[0:55:15] <Shion963> it's not 60FPS but very sharp
[0:55:16] <+Cynfos> need to get one of these folks on discord or something
[0:55:17] <armchairmaster_> Call Scrublord Max, the video master.
[0:55:18] <%cervidaequus> @bettymwwaahh pat 32? Paige 30 i think
[0:55:18] <ttc_lover> There is a second dial that is not labeled, NM mode that should adjust your aperture or shutter speed. Hopefully the shutter speed because that would make it easier
[0:55:19] <+Ambience7817x> it's there a dial or digital menu?
[0:55:21] <%Marg0Pol0> You need to be in Backstreet Boys with your audio, Paige
[0:55:25] <%PinkertonDanPie> the frames look good to me
[0:55:25] <%RAGING_1NF3RNO> There's ghosting.
[0:55:25] <$Tetrapony> Is that doggo on the reflection of the screen?
[0:55:27] <+Wandor__> No its too high quality for twitches bitrate
[0:55:28] <+Invlux> Kappa
[0:55:30] <%samTUMZlettuce> ... Anyone like Diet Caffeinated beverages here?.........
[0:55:30] <+Seitine> Works fine on my machine. lionNice
[0:55:32] <Broken_Sonex> 30's? Might as well be dead
[0:55:33] <heartlesshealer> BETTER THAN EARLIER. Mostly problematic with wide dramatic movements.
[0:55:34] <+RandyFistburgers> it legit looks like it's locked at 20fps
[0:55:34] <+emperordread> Down 2 Focus (manually)
[0:55:36] <+flexin_apex> Yup
[0:55:38] <JoeStillLife> LUL
[0:55:40] <dracovastor> Auto focus
[0:55:41] <%ThomasOfTroy> Please fix autofocus, it's seriously going insane and actually hurts my head
[0:55:42] <How2BEpic> wow that autofocus is bad
[0:55:43] <%ospreyworks> I AM DYING.
[0:55:45] <%CommanderSqueaks> XD
[0:55:45] <Bluerose09> auto focus bad
[0:55:45] <thetransagenda> jesus
[0:55:46] <%Teintstein> lol the blind leading the blind
[0:55:47] <Jaxnos> the framerate currently makes you guys look stop-motion
[0:55:47] <%CommanderSqueaks> Jesus christ
[0:55:47] <$sumrand0> Gingers break White Balance settings they're too white
[0:55:49] <Dakuu75> @PeachSaliva is it possible to show us the desktop so we could see what your clicking?
[0:55:50] <+realm_forge> The camera is drunk!
[0:55:51] <$cade_calrayn> She does indeed
[0:55:52] <Kiyoske> she is fabulous
[0:55:53] <CrisLeFortl> now press the button  that fixes everything
[0:55:54] <+Take_2_shots> if you're confused on how this looks on Stream just look on your phone at Twitch and turn the volume down to see what we're seeing.
[0:55:54] <LoneFonte> autofocus is going nuts
[0:55:54] <sakeydo> Shes trying to cater to the picky fuckers chat
[0:55:55] <hookycookie> Looks ok, just need auto focus sorting
[0:55:55] <JohnClaggart> almost as if she read the manual
[0:55:57] <belliqua> yeah I have to just minimize the tab it's not possible to watch lol
[0:55:57] <%Ranryu692> auto focus is going nuts
[0:55:57] <Case_Ah_Dia> @PeachSaliva OBS, Configure Video, turn off low light compensation?
[0:55:58] <+SteamyLinguini64> That sounded like the most helpful advice
[0:56:00] <%jarednotwithsubway> it does look locked to 20, but its probably fine
[0:56:03] <%BoxNavy> turn off M
[0:56:03] <@SoFarFetched> ITS DARK geefGasp put the lights on
[0:56:03] <+Invlux> Pass the camera to me I'll fix it Kappa
[0:56:04] <%GabeSweetMan> Aaaand the boobs are out again
[0:56:06] <%walternatorz> I am despaired.
[0:56:07] <%vexion_smh> despair
[0:56:07] <Sotetsu> I like the autofocus. It keeps things spicy!
[0:56:08] <%Kenzo2000> I hope we get more streams like this one
[0:56:08] <+drk_sd> THE DIAL CONTROLLS THE SHUTTER SPEED
[0:56:08] <+Rekinsinn> it sounds like auto focus went crazy after you set it to M
[0:56:09] <So_I_Started_Blasting> just gotta hold still
[0:56:11] <%Shotgun_Hobo1> Worst its even been
[0:56:12] <%cervidaequus> Vaseline screen focus
[0:56:13] <Broken_Sonex> @PeachSaliva Could it be just too good Twitch? Or for us to handle?
[0:56:13] <+Kurt_0> Uh oh
[0:56:14] <%Teintstein> we can't see shit
[0:56:15] <%Carquar> This is way better than the ending of Doom Eternal
[0:56:16] <$Tetrapony> the mustard frame rate is too high for this stream
[0:56:16] <+Basilias_Maximus> Auto focus should probably be fine when Pat's not there.
[0:56:17] <dots4eyes> The lights is out....the lights is out....who said that?
[0:56:18] <peachy996> So it doesn't look as choppy to me but the Auto Focus is doing a wild
[0:56:18] <Ravioli_Ronin> You know what it looks better than pat’s stream can, and that’s all that matters
[0:56:19] <+RandyFistburgers> become statue
[0:56:20] <+fromnibelheim> not to be an asshole but I really think some youtube tutorials would be really helpful here
[0:56:21] <+BettyMwwaahh> maybe they should Google how the camera works like normal people
[0:56:21] <%PinkertonDanPie> auto focus seems to be the only problem
[0:56:23] <+kumaprime> she's got her feet out look away
[0:56:24] <+realm_forge> Ask Jesus for more camera fluid
[0:56:25] <%CommanderSqueaks> Paige,desu
[0:56:26] <%ShockzNDrawe> Paige looks like she was super imposed infront of a blurry background os pat sitting in a room with the dog

[0:56:44] <+Cobaltor_252> same
[0:56:45] <+drk_sd> USE THE DIAL TO CHANGE THE SHUTTER SPEED
[0:56:45] <%SilvaChariot0133> focus fixed
[0:56:46] <LifesNeverHumDrum> i dont think it's "frame rate" becauce that's output, it looks like input, ie "shutter speed", but im not a mathemagician
[0:56:46] <$Tetrapony> ginger in the background could ruin autofocus?
[0:56:47] <%BoxNavy> hooray
[0:56:48] <%Lunarhawk> Auto focus is fixed  choppy is still choppy
[0:56:48] <+Wool> At least this is a good opportunity to get into photography.
[0:56:49] <%Ranryu692> are there more people in here right now than were in Pat's Doom stream? LUL

[0:56:58] <%CommanderSqueaks> We are back to square 0
[0:56:58] <How2BEpic> Focus fixed, still choppy. Visually better though.
[0:57:00] <$sumrand0> Test it via Safety Dance
[0:57:03] <wantedsafe471> yeah, much better
[0:57:03] <%jarednotwithsubway> autofocus looks good but framerate is still locked 20 it seems
[0:57:04] <%Teintstein> frame-rate is back to slow
[0:57:04] <+Anonymasque> Looks improved to me
[0:57:07] <+Wandor__> Either the camera is shaking or the framerate is fucked

[0:57:16] <%Marg0Pol0> Hi Paige's mom
[0:57:17] <+flexin_apex> Looks good
[0:57:17] <belliqua> paige why don't you take a picture of your setup and then hold your phone to the webcam? that might be faster
[0:57:17] <+drk_sd> use the dial to change the shutter speed
[0:57:18] <+AWr00tBear> sipsipGasm sipsipGasm sipsipGasm

[0:57:29] <How2BEpic> pat shakes
[0:57:29] <peachy996> You should watch yourself to determine how choppy
[0:57:30] <%vexion_smh> we stand supportive parents
[0:57:31] <%ospreyworks> Wall mount the camera?
[0:57:32] <Calek> turn the M upside down for Wumbo
[0:57:35] <PanicSwytch> Idk what people are complaining. Its good on mobile for me

[0:57:38] <Spydurman> @PeachSaliva If you go to Camera in Windows does that bring up your settings?

[0:57:38] <%vexion_smh> *stan
[0:57:41] <@SoFarFetched> go one more circle,just in case Kappa
[0:57:43] <Shion963> but Baba
[0:57:44] <%GabeSweetMan> The only solution to this is MORE CIRCLES.
[0:57:44] <+jessebsnes> CINEMATIC
[0:57:45] <%samTUMZlettuce> Five circles LUL
[0:57:46] <$happyface699> Dog go snore

[0:57:49] <ragasquid> dog sounds like my dad snoring
[0:57:50] <Srthunda> kets go for another circle for the fun of it
[0:57:51] <+Wandor__> If you are at 24 FPS that is fine but you need to fix the iso
[0:57:52] <extradopeness> It’s fine
[0:57:54] <%VoidBaronJules> Pat is Correct
[0:57:54] <%samTUMZlettuce> I'm dying.
[0:57:55] <EMFole> if the camera is set to 60 fps, then it is recording at 60fps, it has to be something with cam link or OBS
[0:57:55] <$Tetrapony> Pat is vibrating his leg a lot
[0:57:55] <$sumrand0> Ssssss Aaaaaaaa Fffffff Eeeeeeee Ttttttttt Yyyyyyyyyyyyy DANCE
[0:57:57] <dracovastor> auto focus fixed , frame-rate is low, but thats ok

[0:58:20] <%Lunarhawk> Sound is good and synced but we cant quite hear the clap of pats cheeks so you need to mic those up
[0:58:21] <Spydurman> @PeachSaliva search Camera in your Windows Search bar and look for the Settings button in there
[0:58:21] <+Anonymasque> Sony menus are a bear so it will take some time
[0:58:21] <%crusaderthree7gamer> crusaderthree7gamer subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 3 months! What's good
[0:58:23] <%Teintstein> pat about to do a crotch-tweet
[0:58:24] <$happyface699> Sound is great
[0:58:25] <JohnClaggart> the foam would help with reverb more behind you
[0:58:26] <+realm_forge> Change out the speaker fluid
[0:58:26] <wantedsafe471> sound is good
[0:58:28] <armchairmaster_> Upload chat into your brain through the USB, and we will get infinite frames
[0:58:28] <moonmintparadise> yes
[0:58:29] <%jarednotwithsubway> for reverb it might help
[0:58:30] <Xelhesia> not really sound is fine
[0:58:30] <samcast1> sounds fine
[0:58:32] <ttc_lover> The frames per second doesn’t matter, it’s the shutter speed needs to match the frame rate. The shutter speed needs to be double the number the frame rate is. So if you’re in 30 frames per second, set the shutter speed to 1/60. This will give you natural motion blur
[0:58:32] <%ospreyworks> Directly in front of you and directly behind you
[0:58:34] <Dr_Mooose> sound sounds good
[0:58:34] <+Walopoh> honestly pretty good
[0:58:34] <$Tetrapony> the snooring of the doggo is ASMR like
[0:58:35] <%RedPanda25> for reverb yea
[0:58:36] <rcand9> are you gonna shout over there?
[0:58:37] <+barrakuta371> a rug would help
[0:58:37] <Sotetsu> Sounds fine, except for Pat.
[0:58:37] <+zamatermort> yes you do
[0:58:38] <$sumrand0> Sounds great
[0:58:40] <%czeekytv> You could use more soundproofing
[0:58:42] <+Hackmandotcom> pat sounds like triple pat
[0:58:43] <thedank> How much for the pee pee pics?
[0:58:44] <+RandyFistburgers> it'll still reflect sounds off the wall
[0:58:45] <%Kenzo2000> Sounds is good, it could be a little less reverby, but it's NBD
[0:58:45] <+Seitine> Sound is fine, but you could put more on all the walls.
[0:58:47] <%SMuffinMan> sipsipGasm sipsipGasm sipsipGasm sipsipGasm sipsipGasm
[0:58:52] <bruuzer12> Doesn't sound horrible as is
[0:58:52] <LifesNeverHumDrum> all foam all the time
[0:58:53] <@Jekado> everywhere
[0:58:54] <How2BEpic> at least do the corners
[0:58:57] <+Dunmarkh> everywhere
[0:58:58] <+jessebsnes> Just pretend this is Bloodborne fps mode
[0:58:58] <%BoxNavy> cover the entire wwall
[0:58:58] <%VoidBaronJules> Ceiling?
[0:59:00] <@Jekado> any hard surface
[0:59:01] <$happyface699> Pats onlyfans comin soon
[0:59:01] <belliqua> it's not good enough for like, professional let's plays, but for streams it's totally fine
[0:59:01] <%ospreyworks> just put the foam where you speak and directly behind you from there
[0:59:03] <%czeekytv> Rug is good, literally just put shit in the room
[0:59:04] <Shion963> yeah at least that entire wall on the right
[0:59:05] <+JeanGStreams> whao odd fps thing going on?
[0:59:05] <heartlesshealer> that wall to the door's left
[0:59:05] <+Wandor__> 2 walls and a rug is more than enough
[0:59:06] <%BoxNavy> and the floor
[0:59:06] <%SuckerPunchSyd> Maybe a rug would help too oh noce
[0:59:06] <peachy996> Fill the entire room with foam
[0:59:09] <TechGamer> What Camera did u get?
[0:59:09] <+Take_2_shots> Also your ceiling
[0:59:09] <%ShockzNDrawe> You could always have a curten that you put up when streaming behind you
[0:59:10] <stardustno1r> yup
[0:59:10] <hookycookie> Just fill the room with stuff to help
[0:59:10] <Sotetsu> Is that a bottle of mustard? fmgS
[0:59:12] <%BRBN310> do it at head level when youre sitting
[0:59:14] <+Walopoh> The Jerma985 method: soundproof using Funko Pops stacked on the walls
[0:59:14] <+Basilias_Maximus> Having stuff up will help a lot.
[0:59:15] <%PinkertonDanPie> oh my goodness the BABY BegWan
[0:59:15] <Srthunda> it looks like a closet
[0:59:15] <@Jekado> you can also set up a drape to catch reflections
[0:59:16] <$cade_calrayn> Bookshelves and then foam  around them
[0:59:16] <$sumrand0> Honestly its REALLY NOT THAT BAD
[0:59:16] <%ospreyworks> Rug on the floor
[0:59:17] <duckmeister7> foam does not help with sound treatment AT ALL, you need rockwool insulation
[0:59:17] <Lutre> yeah decorations should fix most of it, do that before adding more foam
[0:59:18] <+SteamyLinguini64> Corners, center of each wall, etc
[0:59:18] <panic_rabbit> foam is good, towels are better
[0:59:19] <morglea> Hit the corners
[0:59:19] <@Jekado> yes
[0:59:19] <%samTUMZlettuce> "Too long of hugs"...
[0:59:20] <%Gasgrave> not whole room
[0:59:20] <%PrincessAlex23> Foam it up like a lame teenage dance party
[0:59:20] <%SMuffinMan> egg cartons legit works
[0:59:21] <+Fantion> weeks
[0:59:22] <%VoidBaronJules> Jayztwocents has a good video on soundproofing
[0:59:22] <PleaseCallMeSugar> framerate bad, sound good but could be a little better, visuals good, very slight desync between video and audio, also don't look now but there's a weird goblin freak behind you
[0:59:22] <$silentblast93> yes
[0:59:23] <aiutare47> Right now it’s a trillion times better than bathroom stream
[0:59:23] <%PinkertonDanPie> rug
[0:59:24] <+kumaprime> everywhere, the walls, the floor, the door, the ceiling, the pat
[0:59:24] <Ravioli_Ronin> @ttc_lover we tried that, but I don’t think they know how to change that
[0:59:25] <%walternatorz> skelmo will absorb some sound
[0:59:25] <LifesNeverHumDrum> curtain isn
[0:59:28] <extradopeness> Ceiling too
[0:59:29] <Neo_Kaiser> If Paige is old than why does she wear a scrunchie?
[0:59:32] <@CoalSavoie> Booths are miserably hot. But you don't need to cover every single inch
[0:59:34] <+Seitine> Fill the room with what you're going to put in there, then foam the spots you have blank. But it's not bad at all.
[0:59:34] <samcast1> it sounds pretty good
[0:59:37] <Zeif00> We'll get there
[0:59:37] <%Spirit_hz> Corner traps, rug, and sheets in the roof should do the trick
[0:59:37] <%Kenzo2000> The audio is totally fine already
[0:59:38] <+emperordread> honestly sounds a-ok to me
[0:59:40] <Dakuu75> @PeachSaliva you could start by placing SOME foam everywhere. like, space it. Then if it's not good enough. add more.
[0:59:40] <belliqua> if you fill the room with more stuff in general it'll get better, it doesn't have to be just sound foam
[0:59:41] <hookycookie> Way better than previous stream from room
[0:59:41] <%jarednotwithsubway> oh well
[0:59:42] <danpc5> i think it sounds great Paige
[0:59:42] <@SoFarFetched> We can draw a layout of where you should put the sound proofing at.
[0:59:42] <%ShockzNDrawe> bathroom?
[0:59:46] <%PinkertonDanPie> rug rug
[0:59:49] <dan_g_v> snores?
[0:59:50] <peachy996> Gief is actually helping us ouut with the audio Lol
[0:59:53] <%ThomasOfTroy> This would be fine imo
[0:59:54] <$sumrand0> <3 <3 <3 SeemsGood
[0:59:55] <%Kenzo2000> Yeah
[0:59:55] <heartlesshealer> the wall/corner behind floor tv or whatever that is
[0:59:56] <LifesNeverHumDrum> i was gonna say "curtain isnt a bad idea"
[0:59:56] <Xelhesia> yup
[0:59:56] <%BoxNavy> yes
[0:59:56] <%CommanderSqueaks> This is fine.
[0:59:56] <%PinkertonDanPie> yup
[0:59:57] <%czeekytv> Yeah shit is profesh
[0:59:57] <+Dunmarkh> yeah it would be *fine*
[0:59:58] <impulse255dj> yeah
[0:59:58] <Rwctt> yes
[0:59:58] <@SoFarFetched> Yeah its a good angle.
[0:59:58] <%samTUMZlettuce> Twitch CRIBS?
[0:59:59] <+CelioHogane> I seen worse.
[0:59:59] <%jarednotwithsubway> yeah definitely
[0:59:59] <%SilvaChariot0133> yeah it's fine
[0:59:59] <Chimeraelite> yep it'd be finer
[0:59:59] <%walternatorz> Square Enix knew what they were getting into
[1:00:00] <PanicSwytch> Yes
[1:00:00] <$AzureGale> Sure
[1:00:00] <+RandyFistburgers> a big square on the wall behind you ought to take care of most of the rest of the echo
[1:00:00] <$cade_calrayn> Honestly, try a stream with the bookshelves, and if it's bad, then foam
[1:00:00] <KaiserMario> This is fine Paige, stop overreacting...
[1:00:00] <Sotetsu> Perfectly acceptable
[1:00:01] <%GabeSweetMan> It's fiiiiine
[1:00:01] <rcand9> yep
[1:00:01] <+kumaprime> it looks good from here
[1:00:02] <%SuckerPunchSyd> Yeah
[1:00:03] <Virokwet> yup
[1:00:03] <%Carquar> Yeah it sounds just fine
[1:00:03] <+b1unkey> yeah!
[1:00:03] <%RedPanda25> I'd watch it
[1:00:04] <%PrincessAlex23> @neo_kaiser it's not the 90's anymore grandpa, scrunchies ARE for old people
[1:00:05] <mongorific> totally fine
[1:00:05] <%BoxNavy> doge
[1:00:05] <stardustno1r> ye
[1:00:07] <$TIME_PUNCHER> 100% fine
[1:00:07] <Coystick> He sleeeeeeep
[1:00:07] <aiutare47> Yes
[1:00:07] <Zeif00> We're just glad you're here
[1:00:08] <%jarednotwithsubway> for sure
[1:00:09] <weissguard> psaDogchamp psaDogchamp psaDogchamp
[1:00:09] <extradopeness> It’s fine for the most part
[1:00:10] <+SteamyLinguini64> I would pay money for you to game
[1:00:10] <wantedsafe471> someone said a cheap way to reduce reverb was to record under a blanket
[1:00:10] <%ShockzNDrawe> you look a little low, so maybe lowering the camera a bit but other than that idk looks fine
[1:00:12] <@Jekado> sound is gonna go everywhere because it travels in waves so you want the reflections to be caught from every angle
[1:00:13] <Jaxnos> i think the stopmotion effect currently happening might be the camera set to one framerate and the software you're streaming through is trying to stream the feed at a different framerate
[1:00:13] <%GabeSweetMan> That is the slap of CHONK. Meaty boi.
[1:00:14] <LoneFonte> there IS room for improvement, but it is already great
[1:00:15] <hookycookie> Would be happy
[1:00:15] <duckmeister7> foam does absolutely nothing for sound, the only proper sound treatment is rockwool insulation, please take the foam down it is a fire hazard
[1:00:16] <PinoProxie> back to sleep
[1:00:16] <%YakumoYomi> Sounds fine.
[1:00:16] <Quiet__Viking> Foam the wall in front of you
[1:00:17] <%vexion_smh> <3
[1:00:17] <+emperordread> his tiny little legs when he wakes up <3
[1:00:18] <simulationbard> He snore loud
[1:00:20] <+Take_2_shots> He'll wake up but he'll never stop snoring
[1:00:21] <+Hackmandotcom> you sound fine pat sounds like a tin man
[1:00:22] <+VestigeOuroboros> if you want the reverb to die, just chuck some bass traps in the top corners of the room.
[1:00:22] <%PinkertonDanPie> he sleepy old man boy
[1:00:22] <ChungusQuest> Some more furniture/decor in the room will help break up what little echo there is
[1:00:23] <bruuzer12> Chonky boi
[1:00:23] <Emperor_Machinus> Hi Paige
[1:00:24] <+terraspan> can Pat use that audio filtering program?
[1:00:25] <$Tetrapony> Doggo Noooooooooooo
[1:00:25] <%BoxNavy> me :)
[1:00:28] <+Dunmarkh> this is better than most plague streams.
[1:00:31] <ragasquid> yeah definitely
[1:00:32] <%CommanderSqueaks> "I just want to do a god jooooob!":
[1:00:33] <@SoFarFetched> all this JUST for me geefSmush
[1:00:33] <EASrake> I think a noise gate would improve the quality. Cut out the ambient reverb
[1:00:34] <belliqua> just seen your expressions in HD is great
[1:00:34] <Virokwet> perfection must be attained
[1:00:35] <$silentblast93> hows elmo btw paige
[1:00:35] <+SveriSageAdvice> Posted the instructions for the shutter speed in Pat's discord
[1:00:36] <%Kenzo2000> Paige's sense of hearing is very sensitive, it's how she sees
[1:00:36] <%samTUMZlettuce> ...
[1:00:36] <%CommanderSqueaks> *good
[1:00:37] <+dunesofrage> it sounds great. 10 out of 10
[1:00:37] <dots4eyes> mmmm....meeee
[1:00:40] <%vexion_smh> for me? :)
[1:00:42] <+miguelrod777> for meee
[1:00:43] <$happyface699> That dog is sleep
[1:00:44] <extradopeness> HE FAT
[1:00:44] <leinadtonu> we deserve nothing tho
[1:00:44] <OPCZAR> If you want perfection, paint everything green screen, even the exercise bike
[1:00:44] <$TIME_PUNCHER> where's the cliche LED lights tho
[1:00:45] <$SiameseSneeze> paige is gaslighting us
[1:00:45] <+thebeargoesHONK> different.  why are you not in the dungeon?
[1:00:46] <armchairmaster_> All you have to do is complete the rest of the setup, like the TV and whatnot. Funiture on its' own helps soundproof a lot, and then AFTER everything is set up you can install more soundproofing if you feel it's not up to snuff.
[1:00:46] <bakkatohri> Oh you're doing this ~for me~ uwu Does Pat know about this owo
[1:00:49] <%Shotgun_Hobo1> We expect these streams to be passable, not good
[1:00:49] <+RandyFistburgers> yeah you have a lot of extra dead frame above your head
[1:00:51] <Dakuu75> jesus-christ, Paige's hair is gorgeous. i'm fucking jealous
[1:00:52] <mattmmkay> is that mustard beside you?
[1:00:52] <+Wandor__> its fine now. sound reflection is exponentional so ~20% sound proof is hard too distinguish from 80%
[1:00:53] <+Wool> I think you could just ask Woolie and he'll know everything to do
[1:00:54] <udurbalanced> Paige isn't overreacting until we get some 'direct-uhhhhhhhs'
[1:00:55] <danpc5> Its better than Pat's Streams also
[1:00:55] <$Tetrapony> bring the cat.
[1:00:55] <$RetroCop87> pLAGUE STREAMS RUN LIKE DIALUP
[1:00:56] <Geeeff123> the depth of view is kinda weird
[1:00:59] <heartlesshealer> DON'T USE FILTER. It says Paige does not exist, remember?
[1:00:59] <+Seitine> LUL
[1:01:00] <%ospreyworks> Genuinely just fine. I've heard way, way worse audio
[1:01:00] <peachy996> Better than some of the older Two Best Friends streams
[1:01:01] <rcand9> actual instructions?
[1:01:03] <TonberryLives> Gurl, shit looks like a great setup
[1:01:04] <+Dunmarkh> I mean the quality of plague streams
[1:01:11] <Bluerose09> beautiful hair paige
[1:01:11] <dracovastor> I just turned it to 480p in the settings you look great
[1:01:13] <Ravioli_Ronin> Stream isn’t in 144p, can’t watch
[1:01:16] <peyodogo> gosd im so high
[1:01:17] <hookycookie> How bigs the screen, can you see it?
[1:01:17] <%BoxNavy> monkaS
[1:01:19] <+SteamyLinguini64> What brand of mustard is that on your desk?
[1:01:26] <Shion963> wouldn't the echo help with the echolocation
[1:01:28] <%PrincessAlex23> Plague streams look at quality vs quantity and just throw them both in the trash like a champ
[1:01:28] <+VestigeOuroboros> so you're saying there's more than 2 pats worth of room height
[1:01:28] <TheZearGuy> My eyes and ears must be garbage. Everything looks and sounds fine.
[1:01:31] <belliqua> they mean you're not centered in frame. which doesn't matter since you're in 4:3 anyway
[1:01:31] <JohnClaggart> the non-m mode of the camera would help with the extra room there
[1:01:38] <$sumrand0> Angles are whatever a green screen makes backgrounds irrelevant too
[1:01:39] <+kumaprime> go with the aris camera angle
[1:01:39] <%jarednotwithsubway> shutter
[1:01:41] <simulationbard> Why would you need high ceilings you live with Pat Kappa
[1:01:41] <+LordSDB> Plague has real fun streams, he did another Dangonronpa 2 stream this morning
[1:01:42] <KaiserMario> You can zoom in the camera so you don't have so much "not you" on screen LUL
[1:01:43] <%ospreyworks> SHUTTER
[1:01:43] <%BoxNavy> shutter?????
[1:01:44] <+terraspan> big farts
[1:01:45] <Ravioli_Ronin> Are you gonna put like some LEDs or smth in the BG?
[1:01:45] <Xelhesia> shutter speed
[1:01:45] <skrewarrior> is he snoring or farting?
[1:01:46] <LifesNeverHumDrum> shutter
[1:01:48] <udurbalanced> The boy sounds like a rusty motorcycle
[1:01:49] <+drk_sd> shutter speed use the dial
[1:01:50] <+Cynfos> shutter
[1:01:51] <floralkami> oh wow, this camera is so clear!! you look amazing.
[1:01:51] <%CommanderSqueaks> SNOOOOOOOOOOORE
[1:01:51] <Sotetsu> Soundproof Zangief's snores. fmgLOVE
[1:01:53] <%PrincessAlex23> Are the ceilings high, or are you guys just small?
[1:01:53] <+thefakeh> neither of those will affect the frame rate of the video
[1:01:55] <%ospreyworks> Twitch Plays Camera Man
[1:01:56] <st_jimmy456> 4:3 to protect Paige’s vision
[1:01:57] <%crowlord4> You planning on installing drop ceiling tiles to smallify the room reverb?
[1:02:00] <+Aeoneth> I thove that snooozy dog
[1:02:01] <Bluerose09> snore baby
[1:02:03] <ttc_lover> Shutter speed
[1:02:05] <$cade_calrayn> he's sleeping... look at those feets
[1:02:06] <$TIME_PUNCHER> it's great you got Zangief since you already had the doggy doors installed for Pat @peachsaliva
[1:02:07] <rcand9> here we g stream
[1:02:08] <%SilvaChariot0133> *Drumroll*

[1:02:25] <Sotetsu> Show us Elmo's belly, please
[1:02:28] <Namaztak> Shutter speed is not the problem. That's a stylistic thing that can be changed at will later. That has nothing to do with this lag.
[1:02:29] <somekindofsam> monkaS
[1:02:31] <putnampuppeteer> disaster stream?
[1:02:34] <CappuccinoGuil> It's 1:35 AM, I'm way too invested in this test stream LUL
[1:02:34] <+Wool> has Pat never used a DSLR before?
[1:02:38] <@Jekado> that might be record button or take a photo if its a circle

[1:03:35] <Jaxnos> i can hear Pat's look of disbelief
[1:03:36] <%walternatorz> Paige is on trial.
[1:03:36] <putnampuppeteer> oh my GOD THIS IS SO AMAZING. I don't know what I expected but it exceeds all of my expectations.
[1:03:40] <Lutre> DSPaige strikes again

[1:03:47] <%ShockzNDrawe> Paige it took Pat 4 years to figure out how to not stream in 480p one stream isn't going to kill you

[1:03:59] <%CommanderSqueaks> Lighting is good.
[1:03:59] <%GabeSweetMan> Lighting looks great actually
[1:04:01] <+Dives__> Isn't technology hellish?
[1:04:02] <%Kenzo2000> Paige, you should get a fancy RGB keyboard, so everyone knows you're a gamer. That counts as lighting
[1:04:04] <$JoshManVGH> Sent user guides to Pat on Twitter
[1:04:04] <udurbalanced> Guys be nice, there's nuthin she cuhd do
[1:04:04] <Case_Ah_Dia> lights are fine
[1:04:05] <@commanderclaw> You gonna try streaming a game?
[1:04:05] <OneThousandTomatoes> im bad at discerning lighting
[1:04:06] <+sn0rlaxxxx> whale tits?!?
[1:04:08] <+Kise77> looks really good
[1:04:08] <%GabeSweetMan> You're very well lit
[1:04:08] <+VestigeOuroboros> it's perfectly fine.
[1:04:08] <%CommanderSqueaks> Lights are good
[1:04:08] <+chance_h> nice managed to catch a stream. i was worried i wouldn't get to hear y'all complan today
[1:04:09] <+Hackmandotcom> COLORS!!!

[1:04:09] <+RushUnplugged> lights are a-ok
[1:04:11] <+Walopoh> get cool neon streamer wall lights
[1:04:11] <Arweynn> arng
[1:04:12] <%BoxNavy> its good. not ornj at all
[1:04:13] <JohnClaggart> you'll want a ring light on your right hand side
[1:04:14] <%ShockzNDrawe> stream baba
[1:04:14] <Admiral_PopnFresh> Hi Peach
[1:04:14] <Futurecity10> Where a mask
[1:04:14] <Dakuu75> @PeachSaliva I really like the lighting actually. more bright, hurts my eyes
[1:04:15] <%AyotoCorp> There's this weird goblin in the background
[1:04:16] <Lutre> ornj
[1:04:17] <hookycookie> Little brighter
[1:04:18] <Sotetsu> It looks great in there because you two are in the room!
[1:04:18] <mattmmkay> looks good
[1:04:18] <%Teintstein> light is actually not bad
[1:04:19] <+kumaprime> the color is fine
[1:04:19] <$sumrand0> more Orb
[1:04:19] <+SveriSageAdvice> the lighting seems fine color-wise
[1:04:20] <%Spirit_hz> just some kinks to iron out
[1:04:20] <CloudCircus> Did they move?
[1:04:21] <+Kurt_0> I think it’s fine
[1:04:21] <heartlesshealer> Lighting fine if you took up more of the camera space
[1:04:21] <%jarednotwithsubway> ornj
[1:04:22] <Tracazoid> Lighting seems fine, it's just the framerate that's the problem
[1:04:22] <@commanderclaw> Pat's there, so it's always maximum orange
[1:04:22] <peachy996> The lighting looks fine but what I've noticed is the backround looks warm but you look cold
[1:04:22] <%Marg0Pol0> Paige, if you are worried get a green screen
[1:04:22] <penitentpendant> This feels like one of those Rom-Com situations where a page in a cookbook gets stuck together and Paige combined recipes.
[1:04:22] <Xelhesia> lightning is great with light on or off
[1:04:24] <$TIME_PUNCHER> get a blacklight
[1:04:26] <%axenred> zangief snoring lol
[1:04:26] <%VoidBaronJules> lighting is good
[1:04:27] <+Take_2_shots> Just put Dog in front of camera for 5 minutes, call it a Stream, Go to Bed.
[1:04:29] <bakkatohri> You need to add a function that constantly shifts the hue and give everybody discounts for acid.]
[1:04:29] <@MelBrooksKA> Needs more erng
[1:04:30] <LifesNeverHumDrum> honestly paige this is fine, like, perfection would be weird
[1:04:30] <%ThomasOfTroy> Honestly seems fine to me
[1:04:30] <glgzephyr> I'm not used to seeing Pat this well lit and I hate it
[1:04:31] <Bluerose09> lighting looks crystal clear and pristine
[1:04:31] <%ospreyworks> Lighting fine
[1:04:32] <+RealPT1> iso go up light look better but picture get grainier
[1:04:33] <wantedsafe471> this would make for a good bs man video
[1:04:34] <morglea> The lighting is fine
[1:04:34] <+Seitine> Looks fine.
[1:04:36] <Ravioli_Ronin> Go full e-gurl and get LED hexagons
[1:04:38] <OneThousandTomatoes> paiges office
[1:04:38] <+SteamyLinguini64> Lights are great
[1:04:38] <Geeeff123> dimmer background maybe. looks good right now
[1:04:38] <%vexion_smh> lights are ok but you can do something extra like Max
[1:04:39] <ragasquid> lighting good
[1:04:39] <putnampuppeteer> The combination of great picture quality and bad framerate creates a really weird stop-motion quality.
[1:04:40] <%ShockzNDrawe> shine it off of pat's head
[1:04:40] <+RushUnplugged> Paige is ready for makeup tutorials
[1:04:41] <%BoxNavy> jesus zangief thats a powerful snore
[1:04:42] <Rwctt> Running Flux means I can't tell anything about lighting
[1:04:42] <+tweedler92> Any lighting is a marked improvement over the basement
[1:04:42] <+patriotrenegade> christ that dog
[1:04:43] <%ospreyworks> Maybe get smart bulbs or LED strips for background?
[1:04:44] <+drk_sd> nice
[1:04:45] <$Xevtes> your dog is set to vibrate
[1:04:45] <faithless_zealot> @PeachSaliva Just get a couple of those changing LED lights, and let chat spend channel points to change them
[1:04:45] <PinoProxie> he snore
[1:04:47] <%samTUMZlettuce> Key light
[1:04:47] <+samsam0m> that dog's nose is straight rippin ass
[1:04:48] <reonome> i demand a gamer chair with a gamer color
[1:04:49] <Sotetsu> Decorate the room with Halloween decorations.
[1:04:50] <Dakuu75> she doesn't need big'ol GOD-RAYS shinning on her face
[1:04:51] <Lutre> aww he snore
[1:04:51] <TheZearGuy> What streamer headphones do you use?
[1:04:53] <+BettyMwwaahh> why do I hear a jet engine?
[1:04:55] <mattmmkay> looks good, but thee stream looks terrible...nyuk nyuk nyuk
[1:04:55] <%BoxNavy> WutFace
[1:04:57] <+boxboten> wew too bright
[1:04:57] <Megaleg> You gotta get leds to be a pro streamer
[1:04:57] <LoneFonte> VAMPIRE
[1:04:58] <%PrincessAlex23> This is the most TEST stream that I have ever watched, for sure
[1:04:58] <Namaztak> Put a light behind you if you wanna be separated from the background.
[1:04:58] <Dr_Mooose> oh no white
[1:04:59] <heartlesshealer> Office lighting seems set for Pat's Makeup Tutorial <3
[1:05:01] <%GabeSweetMan> More even glow is much better
[1:05:01] <+chance_h> get soft Bi-Sexual lightning
[1:05:02] <$Tetrapony> stream deed
[1:05:04] <+moranprime> Disco light
[1:05:04] <LifesNeverHumDrum> Zangeif sounds like a tornado
[1:05:04] <belliqua> that's what happens when you're a ghost
[1:05:04] <%cervidaequus> Get the dressing room mirror with 50 light bulbs around it
[1:05:05] <@commanderclaw> Paige becomes grossly incandescent
[1:05:05] <hookycookie> Ghost Paige
[1:05:05] <ChungusQuest> Computer: reduce ambient lighting, 20%
[1:05:05] <peachy996> Shining bright like a diamon
[1:05:05] <glgzephyr> that's a very drastic adjustment
[1:05:07] <$TIME_PUNCHER> better than Woolie staring directly into the FUCKING SUN
[1:05:07] <%jarednotwithsubway> gief
[1:05:07] <morglea> Are you key lights diffused?
[1:05:07] <Emperor_Machinus> She became a ghost
[1:05:08] <+SteamyLinguini64> Oh no that was too white
[1:05:11] <%Marg0Pol0> Paige, one light should be brighter than the other
[1:05:13] <balthazar758> gief engine
[1:05:13] <@Jekado> that looks like the camera's auto white balance
[1:05:14] <Bluerose09> better
[1:05:17] <$AzureGale> That is some really consistent farting LUL
[1:05:17] <+Livelinne> psaDogchamp psaDogchamp psaDogchamp
[1:05:17] <N0N0TTHEBEES> I had first thought it was pat grunting.
[1:05:18] <Joem1k> oh shit, are we in the snyder cut of paige's stream! PogChamp
[1:05:19] <udurbalanced> Zangief purrs like a lawnmower. Please give him forehead smooches.
[1:05:22] <%CommanderSqueaks> XD
[1:05:23] <Admiral_PopnFresh> LUL
[1:05:24] <@CoalSavoie> FYI, when Shutter Speed is lowered, the brightness will redude dramatically and you'll need to fix your lighting after that
[1:05:24] <$sumrand0> Need Cat Ear Headphones otherwise its obviously youre a #fakegamergurl
[1:05:25] <+Invlux> You'll probably have to mess with the White Balance
[1:05:26] <Jaxnos> tbf, i would watch this vlog series with the camera like this. reminds me of early youtube with Lonelygirl15
[1:05:26] <Sotetsu> How about a green screen?
[1:05:26] <%PrincessAlex23> Ghost Paige is too spooky for me
[1:05:27] <%samTUMZlettuce> :)
[1:05:30] <@CoalSavoie> reduce even
[1:05:30] <%ShockzNDrawe> Do the lights have a filter in front of them
[1:05:30] <%GabeSweetMan> Opaque covers is what they mean.
[1:05:32] <$Tetrapony> Now back!
[1:05:33] <%Shotgun_Hobo1> Did she read any of the manuals for anything?
[1:05:33] <@Jekado> diffused means if there is a "film" over the lights to make the light softer
[1:05:34] <%GabeSweetMan> WOW

[1:06:12] <%PrincessAlex23> This is exactly what I wanted when I tuned in.
[1:06:13] <ToneBacas> Paige's mom didn't raise her to be this small
[1:06:14] <+RandyFistburgers> little more even

[1:53:13] <LifesNeverHumDrum> Paige has a power where being in Pat's presence  makes her 5'10
[1:53:14] <How2BEpic> 2 inches apart is right

[1:56:09] <%AncelDeLambert> DAMN RIGHT HE DID
[1:56:09] <$sumrand0> MONOBALL THE LEGENDS ARE TRUE
[1:56:10] <tanarath> You look like you went to a metal concert and were moshing.
[1:56:11] <%AncelDeLambert> I WOULD TOO
[1:56:12] <Valdorick> "Check out my cancer nut"
[1:56:12] <DisneylandPimp> well its confirmed pat
[1:56:12] <%Kenzo2000> I would probably show off too to be fair
[1:56:12] <WhereIsWill> paige's hair looks incredible with this new cam
[1:56:12] <Dr_Mooose> its a conversation starter
[1:56:12] <+RandyFistburgers> That sounds like a harrasment case waiting to happen
[1:56:13] <Lutre> one ball ate the other
[1:56:13] <+b_koj> The fabled Unicle
[1:56:15] <+ChurchMILFs> basketball sized
[1:56:15] <+Fooguwu> I have no balls, just a pouch. Can my balls still be exposed?
[1:56:16] <+Fep3> LUL
[1:56:17] <%bluetocho13> was it worth seeing?
[1:56:17] <@Velyndra> HMMMM'
[1:56:18] <$JoshManVGH> Uh... that's like... cancerous right? or some sort of cyst?
[1:56:18] <senghoulie> Proud of the big ball!
[1:56:19] <+TheMattman1313> It wasn't the marraige ball clearly
[1:56:19] <%BoxNavy> so he had 2 but one was big?
[1:56:19] <+lethallylactic> LUL
[1:56:20] <Admiral_PopnFresh> Those country towns, huh?
[1:56:21] <%CommanderSqueaks> Was it two balls in one scrote?
[1:56:21] <bob900000> LUL
[1:56:22] <+RealThiele> gottem
[1:56:22] <cyb3r_demon> pat lore
[1:56:23] <+vehementvadr> I think I remember this one
[1:56:23] <Emperor_Machinus> Paige's hair is fantastic it looks like it has great volume and amazing sheen
[1:56:23] <derap41> More that 50% different needs a doctor check
[1:56:23] <+thebetterbard> You've mentioned the ball before
[1:56:24] <%Spirit_hz> Cyclops ball
[1:56:26] <afronooch> that ball was his little brother at one point
[1:56:26] <heartlesshealer> Pat's OnlyOrb when? LUL
[1:56:26] <Xelhesia> Gappy's Cousin Bappy
[1:56:26] <How2BEpic> we all know that's a lie because patrick is small
[1:56:28] <%worldbrand> that was the dumbest thing ive ever laughed at
[1:56:28] <@PlagueOfGripes> a pizza burger is a burger but made with pizza sauce in the patty meat, and you put cheese in the middle of it
[1:56:29] <+Dunmarkh> knew a guy in the army who's ball FUCKING exploded
[1:56:30] <+Walopoh> If you have one testicle, it grows larger to make up
[1:56:32] <+Breaknoon> he only had one or one was just huge?
[1:56:36] <balthazar758> was he part of the x-men?
[1:56:37] <+Ches_Neckbeard> I had a friend in high school that seriously had 3 balls. Had all kinds of nicknames
[1:56:38] <+barrakuta371> Not heard this story, but will add it to the Paige lore
[1:56:41] <PinoProxie> WOW
[1:56:42] <%BoxNavy> haha :)
[1:56:44] <vladhelsin> I don't think that's healthy
[1:56:44] <@PlagueOfGripes> I hate Paige's ball stories.
[1:56:44] <+RandyFistburgers> I assume he had it checked for the cancers?
[1:56:46] <Coystick> One time one of my balls swelled up, it's called hyrocele testis or something
[1:56:47] <PleaseCallMeSugar> what are we talking? like, lemon size? apple? fist? softball? be specific
[1:56:47] <ethey16> @peachsaliva have you heard of fit ring? would be fun for streaming.
[1:56:48] <$SvenHolgersson> "YO BABE I GOT ONE OF THESE HUGE BUTS"
[1:56:50] <OneThousandTomatoes> weird story
[1:56:51] <%Lunarhawk> The testicular cancer got him
[1:56:52] <%yet_another_brony> reminds of when dick and shaun wanted you to see their saline inflated balls
[1:56:54] <$JoshManVGH> Probably fucking died!
[1:56:55] <Srthunda> his ball must tell him amazing secrets
[1:57:00] <Virokwet> died of cancer probs
[1:57:00] <%CommanderSqueaks> Thanks, I hate it
[1:57:01] <Dr_Mooose> neat
[1:57:01] <Gehtingsberg> hopefully not testicular cancer
[1:57:02] <heartlesshealer> How does anyone meet these Party Trick guys?
[1:57:02] <derap41> If its more than 50% larger that's a big red flag
[1:57:03] <+terraspan> Became one with the ball...
[1:57:03] <+Walopoh> His name was Louis CK
[1:57:04] <WhereIsWill> oh hell naw
[1:57:04] <luteboy456> MASSIVE SINGULAR NUT
[1:57:04] <lemon_rinds> Your hair is so L O N G 👁👄👁 respect
[1:57:04] <DannyMcgee> He was hanging out before you guys hung out.
[1:57:04] <KyleRhysMarsh> Could have been a tumour
[1:57:09] <%Carquar> Oh lord I love pizza burgers
[1:57:11] <Laironx3> c-targeting got him
[1:57:12] <%CommanderSqueaks> Peach rocking that Rapunzel hair
[1:57:13] <Admiral_PopnFresh> That sounds like a Juicy Lucy
[1:57:13] <armchairmaster_> I don't know what I'm more disturbed by, the strong ball man or Eli's burger monstrosity
[1:57:13] <%heyitsbrian> That's better than my friends "cancer story" where he just pulled his balls over his pants and said it was a tumor
[1:57:15] <+RandyFistburgers> He microwaved that ball
[1:57:15] <cyb3r_demon> herniated
[1:57:18] <bakkatohri> His ball was actually his parasitic twin that grew into a 1:1 clone of him and assumed his identity.
[1:57:20] <@PlagueOfGripes> Assuming my internet works on April 1
[1:57:21] <floralkami> yoooooooo, that sounds deliish and heart-wrenching
[1:57:21] <+thebetterbard> I knew a guy in Highschool who had no nips it was weird.
[1:57:22] <mattmmkay> ball surgery
[1:57:23] <@Velyndra> he held his nut for 15 years
[1:57:26] <+Fep3> not a tumah
[1:57:29] <+TheTunnelSnake> my friend had a huge ball, he had to get a surgery on it
[1:57:30] <%walternatorz> It probably was a twin that was absorbed
[1:57:30] <TheArrow_> his ball was pregnant :(
[1:57:35] <%bluetocho13> super cancer?
[1:57:35] <Emperor_Machinus> Gigatism but only on that one ball
[1:57:35] <%BoxNavy> no
[1:57:37] <$Tetrapony> Did Eli ate a baby sized burger with pizza?
[1:57:38] <derap41> lymph maybe
[1:57:39] <LifesNeverHumDrum> betterbard idk if i believe you but i want to
[1:57:39] <@PlagueOfGripes> How's that drink coming? Great service
[1:57:42] <+emperordread> They call him Big Ball Baggins to this day

[2:55:13] <Profmcstevie> Bro is that a whole ass bear under the bike Kappa
[2:55:18] <%Lunarhawk> What ring would you have bought pat if you did propose to him?
[2:55:20] <+TheMainManAfrika> @PeachSaliva you'd have to get on your stomach to propose to pat
[2:55:20] <%worldbrand> centipedes are cleanup crew
[2:55:25] <ChungusQuest> :Get on your knees, bitch, I need to ask you a question.:
[2:55:26] <%CommanderSqueaks> Why do I feel like you would proposed the same exact way.
[2:55:34] <foxname96> @peachsaliva nah there 100% was something crawling there
[2:55:35] <%LifesNeverHumDrum> he asked first, so you had to let him do the real one
[2:55:36] <%CommanderSqueaks> LUL
[2:55:36] <+Walopoh> If you did he would've already had another ring LUL
[2:55:36] <+solzan2000> might as well

[2:55:44] <%Archer2150> Question about the pelican, do you think it would work alright on carpets? Ive been interested in one of them for a while but no one else I know has had one to talk about it
[2:55:45] <osaka_daioh> PRODUCT PLACEMENT
[2:55:47] <Josar2009> Titanium rings are great.
[2:55:49] <Broken_Sonex> @PeachSaliva Give him a power ranger ring/

[2:55:56] <@JustinianKnight> Ring Pop
[2:56:00] <+ChillTonic> Stream sponsor MANLY BANDS!
[2:56:12] <mike2hands> Onion ring
[2:56:20] <+Catoclystic> that's mustard piss not gold
[2:56:21] <balthazar758> onion ring lol
[2:56:22] <@JustinianKnight> Gold you say justin92NoxusFace
[2:56:25] <%LifesNeverHumDrum> yellow gold for his mustard queen
[2:56:28] <%samTUMZlettuce> Oh bandy-rand....
[2:56:33] <OneThousandTomatoes> awwww
[2:56:34] <%samTUMZlettuce> I'm sorry, bud.
[2:56:35] <$AmanDotZip> onion ring
[2:56:35] <$TIME_PUNCHER> I love goooooold
[2:56:45] <DannyMcgee> Should have picked green gold.
[2:56:48] <GravyLangley> white gold really goes better with diamonds imo
[2:56:51] <%Archer2150> un ordained?
[2:56:55] <%linSP> pat got that FAP ring
[2:56:58] <KingKZ> Your wedding should just be a massive game of Dignity Chicken.
[2:56:58] <%linSP> from dark souls
[2:56:58] <+Walopoh> It would match and stand out with other yellow-gold rings you'd have
[2:56:59] <$TIME_PUNCHER> Would you consider a wedding ring tattoo
[2:57:02] <%samTUMZlettuce> "Where's the FOOD?"
[2:57:07] <foxname96> @peachsaliva Since Woolie is too much of a coward, will you in his stead get sponsored by Manscaped?
[2:57:08] <heartlesshealer> pat got that "don't hit on me" ring
[2:57:29] <dodgy_dingo_> does white gold look different to silver?
[2:57:36] <+solzan2000> yes
[2:57:38] <heartlesshealer> yeah, oddly enough
[2:57:44] <GravyLangley> yeah I can see that, I tend to like more monochrome color schemes in general
[2:57:45] <%LifesNeverHumDrum> white gold and silver do have a dif look
[2:57:48] <+Walopoh> Does it match the brass knuckles you wear in Montreal street fights?
[2:57:49] <Josar2009> are stones other than diamons acceptable for wedding rings?
[2:57:55] <%Archer2150> What does an unordained ring mean?
[2:57:56] <+Arxel1> LUL
[2:57:56] <%BoxNavy> :)
[2:57:59] <bob900000> LUL
[2:57:59] <+lynlyn_ow> yea i saw him wearing it eariler it was sweet
[2:58:03] <OneThousandTomatoes> LUL
[2:58:05] <%CommanderSqueaks> Fight them off with a sticjk
[2:58:05] <$sumrand0> He has to beat them with sticks!
[2:58:11] <%Lunarhawk> He needs to wear it to keep the thots from cancelling him like they tried to do to game grumps
[2:58:11] <$SvenHolgersson> We are the sluts
[2:58:11] <WanderingYoren> do not deny the power of the orb
[2:58:12] <$Tredecian> @PeachSaliva have you ever looked at 3d printed jewlery?
[2:58:19] <CyborgAV> Look Pat's a big streamer man if he didn't get that ring he'd be SWIMMING in it
[2:58:20] <%samTUMZlettuce> I love rune king thor. Maybe I just like runes......
[2:58:28] <Wiiplayah43> Diamonds aren't as valuable as you think: controlled scarcity
[2:58:28] <%samTUMZlettuce> Bluetooth
[2:58:29] <$Sphincter_Spelunker> do they scratch easily
[2:58:29] <$sumrand0> Hardness scale
[2:58:29] <+ChillTonic> Send all the whores back to their lemon orchards!
[2:58:30] <$Sphincter_Spelunker> yea
[2:58:31] <dodgy_dingo_> My mother had a sapphire engagement ring I think
[2:58:31] <%TheMoenia> its because of DeBoers
[2:58:34] <%LifesNeverHumDrum> secondary stones being something other than diamond is what usually happens
[2:58:41] <+diabuddha> unordained likely means plain, like a standard wedding band @Archer2150
[2:58:46] <@SoFarFetched> moistenite? geefThink
[2:58:46] <+razielhex> diamonds are a fukken scam literally invented by De Boers
[2:58:48] <%AncelDeLambert> Ruby is hard as hell
[2:58:50] <Djinnazz> cuz Deboers brainwashed everyone into thing so.
[2:58:51] <heartlesshealer> you want it to not break during daily routines
[2:58:51] <+Walopoh> My geology professor gave his wife an olivine/peridote ring and it looks really fucking cool
[2:58:52] <OneThousandTomatoes> so when she punches a bitch it hurts
[2:58:52] <@Jekado> MOIST
[2:58:56] <%Archer2150> Ah, thanks @diabuddha !
[2:58:56] <$AmanDotZip> omg my Geology is kicking in
[2:58:58] <%blue8moon> my mom has a sapphire
[2:58:59] <metallicfingers1> I am learning so much today
[2:59:01] <+RandyFistburgers> Saphire be hard as too
[2:59:01] <%AncelDeLambert> just don't do an emerald
[2:59:01] <%samTUMZlettuce> Wrong neighborhood.
[2:59:04] <GravyLangley> ugh I had a friend who got an amber ring and it cracked in a week
[2:59:07] <%AncelDeLambert> emeralds are soft as FUCK
[2:59:07] <+razielhex> Everyone who has played MK1 knows how hard what rocks are
[2:59:11] <%yet_another_brony> did you say pokemon
[2:59:13] <Namaztak> "they're actually cheaper" jesus what an understatement that is
[2:59:16] <+Timmaahh97> chaos control!
[2:59:17] <@JustinianKnight> Ah you mean, the chaos emeralds
[2:59:17] <%BoxNavy> stream pokemon emerald
[2:59:23] <%RedPanda25> As much as Chaos Emeralds?
[2:59:25] <extradopeness> Same
[2:59:27] <%blue8moon> emeralds are quite soft
[2:59:29] <Josar2009> Well the thing about hardness is it also makes it more brittle, so hit a diamond a certain way can make it break if hit the right way.
[2:59:30] <+WackyGear> @PeachSaliva you know that rings mean "hit on me" for some people. And those people are crazy.
[2:59:32] <%optimasmaximas> emeril the chef?
[2:59:33] <@Jekado> Soft and Moist confirmed
[2:59:35] <heartlesshealer> emeralds look good, but they need to be a show-off jewel, not something you wear everyday
[2:59:35] <Djinnazz> what does ANY of thst mean?
[2:59:38] <+Kurt_0> What about ruby for the weapon hour
[2:59:40] <+Walopoh> Geo students here, yep they scratch and break all the time labs
[2:59:40] <$AmanDotZip> chaos emerald
[2:59:42] <MasterCosmic> Just like you!
[2:59:45] <+solzan2000> damn you know your stuff
[2:59:46] <OneThousandTomatoes> so what I'm hearing is diamond is unbreakable
[2:59:50] <$Sphincter_Spelunker> @Djinnazz some rocks are harder than others
[2:59:52] <%cervidaequus> Joo take paiges chaos emmerowds??
[2:59:52] <TheAntiNihilist> ? 8 is good tho
[2:59:53] <$sumrand0> Artificial diamonds are cheap and just as hard: often they're used in industry applications along with diamond dust from jewelers.
[2:59:57] <tanarath> Btw, artificial are much, MUCH cheaper and don't fund shady stuff.
[3:00:02] <%optimasmaximas> @onethousandtomatoes breakdown breakdown
[3:00:03] <Arweynn> I know rubies come in more than just red, do green rubies exist?
[3:00:08] <%Kenzo2000> Paige would bust an emerald on all the doors she breaks
[3:00:10] <Wiiplayah43> @OneThousandTomatoes Gureto Daze!
[3:00:14] <bob900000> like all of us
[3:00:16] <%LifesNeverHumDrum> 10 is the highest it can be, so you want it to be as high as possible, because some things can be higher than the ring
[3:00:16] <heartlesshealer> it could break if you tap it against a doorknob, that's something you don't want in a forever-jewelery
[3:00:18] <Profmcstevie> If it's Dark Souls or SHINY ROCKS, she's your gal
[3:00:20] <OneThousandTomatoes> a savant
[3:00:22] <@SoFarFetched> Sapphire is my birthstone geefBlank
[3:00:25] <+solzan2000> lol
[3:00:25] <DracaenaLeaf> nor a Peridot I assume
[3:00:28] <TonberryLives> Talk about diamond cabals
[3:00:33] <%samTUMZlettuce> Yippee Kay Yay Mr.Falcon
[3:00:35] <%BinaryFireball> what about space stones?
[3:00:36] <$AmanDotZip> quartz fella, and I'll call it a diamknd she'll never know
[3:00:37] <heartlesshealer> turquoise better for necklace than ring
[3:00:41] <@SoFarFetched> Periodt
[3:00:41] <%BinaryFireball> space stones are cool
[3:00:41] <%DrBunni> would a pearl be a good engagement ring stone?
[3:00:41] <foxname96> @peachsaliva Very Happy for you!   I proposed to my girlfriend after i suffered a grenade misfire accident on a range and was hella morphined up and proposed to the first nurse i saw (uncounciencelly)
[3:00:44] <Josar2009> very informative thank you Paige
[3:00:45] <Broken_Sonex> The stupid know of the stupid things, it is known Kappa
[3:00:51] <+RandyFistburgers> Diamonds can still crack though, like they are still delicate in a way. I wouldn't wear it wrenching on a bulldozer regardless
[3:00:57] <+Walopoh> Peridot is a silicate like quartz, 7/10 hardness
[3:00:57] <WanderingYoren> guess all this makes me wonder why even bother with a stone? a band will do, no?
[3:00:57] <tanarath> Paige, Opals, what about them?
[3:01:00] <TheAntiNihilist> i think Paige would break before an Emerald
[3:01:04] <%samTUMZlettuce> RE-
[3:01:05] <@PlagueOfGripes> pair of dough
[3:01:16] <%Kenzo2000> Opals are rad though
[3:01:18] <heartlesshealer> there are gems you just should wear anywhere else BUT the hand
[3:01:19] <+Walopoh> What about Chaos Emeralds?
[3:01:19] <OneThousandTomatoes> which is the most digestable?
[3:01:21] <%optimasmaximas> @foxname96 was the nurse your gf at the time or did that happen after lol?
[3:01:23] <%LifesNeverHumDrum> ruby and sapphire are corundums, which is p dang strong
[3:01:30] <$Sphincter_Spelunker> @OneThousandTomatoes rock candy
[3:01:30] <koffeemancer> What about amethyst?
[3:01:31] <%TheMoenia> what are your thoughts on artificial diamonds?
[3:01:33] <foxname96> @optimasmaximas after
[3:01:36] <armchairmaster_> Use Ruby, so you'll be prepared for the Weapon Hour
[3:01:38] <Wiiplayah43> @foxname96 holy shit dude, you okay?
[3:01:41] <tanarath> Damn
[3:01:45] <Broken_Sonex> But what about the Chaos Emeralds?
[3:01:49] <%worldbrand> gemstone hardness mostly relates to scratching, things will break if you hit them with enough force
[3:01:51] <heartlesshealer> non-blood diamonds are great
[3:01:53] <foxname96> @wiiplayah43 no pinkie
[3:01:57] <+Walopoh> @koffeemancer same properties as quartz because its just a variety
[3:02:04] <impulse255dj> more ethical
[3:02:09] <%Archer2150> Gotta head to bed, good to see you peach, good to see you chat, gnight!
[3:02:10] <%jowi_time> aren't they calling them "desinger diamonds" now?
[3:02:11] <+RandyFistburgers> Clarity go up
[3:02:12] <%Lunarhawk> Also theyre not blood diamonds
[3:02:20] <%BoxNavy> PunchTrees
[3:02:25] <$Sphincter_Spelunker> All I know about rocks is the word cleavage cuz it made me laugh when I was 10
[3:02:28] <@SoFarFetched> STRIKE the earth!
[3:02:28] <+a_c_chirns> but what about minecraft diamonds?
[3:02:32] <%samTUMZlettuce> No verb.
[3:02:35] <Josar2009> How do you feel about titantium jewlery?
[3:02:37] <+RandyFistburgers> Canada had/has a huge diamond mine
[3:02:40] <+Walopoh> only diamonds made of dead people
[3:02:43] <a_mad_dragon_> canadian diamonds DatSheffy
[3:02:44] <$sumrand0> I'll never understand the value of rings especially since I'm a welder and every safety video has taught me jewelry is a great way to maim or "deglove" youself
[3:02:46] <%samTUMZlettuce> Brevity
[3:02:50] <Clundy> Mind Diamonds made from brains
[3:02:52] <%DooWopShaBop> Stop buying diamonds
[3:02:53] <%linSP> BLOOD
[3:02:57] <OneThousandTomatoes> but what if I love the taste of blood?
[3:03:00] <+donpatrondx> spirit diamonds
[3:03:00] <%TheMoenia> blood diamond is a good movie though
[3:03:01] <bob900000> what?
[3:03:01] <%optimasmaximas> B L O O D
[3:03:02] <%BinaryFireball> what about diamonds made from the souls of the dead?
[3:03:03] <$thomassolorio> lab diamonds are harder than natural dimonds
[3:03:03] <Wiiplayah43> @foxname96 Oof. Glad you're getting hitched, though.
[3:03:06] <@JustinianKnight> Blood Diamond sounds much cooler than they are
[3:03:07] <%LifesNeverHumDrum> i work in costume/antique jewelry and the value of things always kinda boggles me
[3:03:07] <+Kise77> are there engagment items that aren't rings?
[3:03:11] <%ShockzNDrawe> Yeah don't
[3:03:13] <+Arxel1> But what if it's a diamond made of all your loved one exes?
[3:03:14] <@JustinianKnight> not actually made of blood sadly
[3:03:14] <heartlesshealer> gotta super compress those ashes of dead people to get a dead people diamond
[3:03:18] <%ShockzNDrawe> fucking wear riongs if you're in the trades
[3:03:20] <OneThousandTomatoes> damnit
[3:03:25] <bob900000> what's a blood diamond?
[3:03:28] <+RandyFistburgers> Chemically the same
[3:03:29] <%samTUMZlettuce> "Maybe he wants ___fish"
[3:03:34] <$thomassolorio> why no dead people dimonds I was going to make my grandma into one
[3:03:37] <%samTUMZlettuce> ....?
[3:03:37] <Josar2009> YO these diamonds are super cursed
[3:03:38] <%TheMattman1313> @PeachSaliva Probably less natural defects/structural imperfections
[3:03:45] <%samTUMZlettuce> woolieFUN
[3:03:47] <heartlesshealer> @bob900000 diamonds mined by slavery and war and such
[3:03:47] <ChungusQuest> A good lab diamond will have zero faults in the crystal structure
[3:03:49] <$Sphincter_Spelunker> @bob900000 basically mined through exploitation, usually deaths involved
[3:03:50] <%CommanderSqueaks> A lot of people I know have been getting engagement tattoos, especially ones who work in trades and don't want to get the ring damaged/ripped off.
[3:03:52] <%Divryne> Someone who was selling diamonds at a place I went to in Vegas lied that lab diamonds break super easily. LUL
[3:03:52] <TheAntiNihilist> as a geologist, naturally forming elements are more stable
[3:04:08] <%czeekytv> Your random bullshit streams are my lifeblood
[3:04:09] <+Timmaahh97> how long have you and pat been together now?
[3:04:16] <$sumrand0> You'd be surprised how many guy leave their wedding band on and get grounded through it though......and thats victims who SHOULD know better. the cultural phenomenon with rings runs deep in older generations
[3:04:19] <%Kenzo2000> Is she an assassin?
[3:04:23] <senghoulie> what about sapphire
[3:04:25] <Josar2009> "does she use her hands alot"
[3:04:26] <%samTUMZlettuce> Throw hands? Conflict?!
[3:04:40] <foxname96> @peachsaliva When are you getting a whiteboard to write subs names on it? Kappa
[3:04:42] <+Walopoh> You can't beat hexagon packing of  carbon atoms, which is what diamonds are
[3:04:54] <%LifesNeverHumDrum> sapphires are nice, usually you want them to be an oblong shape tho
[3:04:58] <TofuNyan> What about a bottle cap. Is that enough? ;v
[3:05:03] <%BoxNavy> monkaS
[3:05:03] <$thomassolorio> why no dead people dimonds though
[3:05:08] <%LifesNeverHumDrum> like montana/navetter or emerald-cut
[3:05:12] <heartlesshealer> cathedral setting pops against every edge
[3:05:16] <$sumrand0> Cathedral rings are  NIGHTMARES to owners AND their victims
[3:05:19] <heartlesshealer> Star Sapphires are hella nice
[3:05:22] <WanderingYoren> Truly is the Ruby Geology hour

[3:18:47] <%ShockzNDrawe> I have to wash my hair everyday because it sucks ass
[3:18:47] <$Sphincter_Spelunker> But I'm a sweaty bitch
[3:18:49] <%LifesNeverHumDrum> everyday is severe overkill yeah, you make ur scalp think it needs to work EVN harder
[3:18:49] <Jaysky> I wash the hair every 3 days cause otherwise my hair feels disgusting
[3:18:49] <+mczarklesby> By the time I figured out the 'don't wash your hair every day' thing I was losing my hair lol.
[3:18:50] <%fishmonger555> Will dry shampoo help if my hair becomes super oily after 20 hours without a shower?
[3:18:52] <cyb3r_demon> they got an oldspice dry shampoo
[3:18:52] <samcast1> yeah, I usually space it out.
[3:18:59] <+diabuddha> especially cause my hair likes to get greasy in less than a full day after a wash
[3:19:00] <%ShockzNDrawe> it's shit
[3:19:06] <+barrakuta371> But what if you have dandruff?
[3:19:12] <%BoxNavy> if i dont use conditioner my hair turns to straw
[3:19:15] <$sumrand0> @balthazar758 well I'm on the internet so you'll never know!!! 😉 lol
[3:19:18] <%DrBunni> everyone's hair is different, you really have to experiement with your wash cycle to figure it out.
[3:19:18] <DannyMcgee> Yeah, by day three my hair is so oily my eyes burn.
[3:19:31] <%BoxNavy> jesus elmo
