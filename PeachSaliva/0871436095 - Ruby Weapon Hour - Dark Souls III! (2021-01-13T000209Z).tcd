[2:05:01] <+Solid_Stro> The taint is the toughest part Paige, that’s why it oneshotted you
[2:05:01] <Jogs__> Midir unconstested the HARDEST MF EVER in a game
[2:05:03] <heartlesshealer> not ent specifically, but there's a good amount of tree-person porn

[2:20:42] <+doomunderthestairs> it is considered one of the easier ones
[2:20:45] <+cowardman93> it's like, one of the easiest bosses in the series
[2:20:46] <%Alazull> Pat has never joked once

[2:20:57] <%alexstreamsathing> This is the most frustrating for me
[2:20:57] <%dekkitout> Can't be Pinwheel though- wait.

[2:22:04] <%pokefan9956> is there a reason why she isn't blocking?
[2:22:05] <%Alazull> Weren't the leg balls dangling, awaiting clubbing?
[2:22:06] <%CantWalkGood> crystal sage

[2:29:55] <laguerrilha> Cant wait for Farron area
[2:29:56] <peachy996> At least for this boss because every time they speak you get so flustered and distracted you end up bungling it
[2:29:57] <%Too_Much_Nukie> There are... techniques, in the force. Against which there is no defense. Like treebagging.
[2:29:57] <wibbwobbler> feel like that was actually pretty close actually
[2:29:58] <%EldritchBee> Does she know the tree scrotum is an optional boss
[2:29:59] <ManfredA> BIG AND STRONG

[2:30:14] <%DrBunni> I come in to hear big boobs
[2:30:15] <%Lion_kun> You get boss weapons from this boss.
[2:30:15] <amonimis> @peachsaliva destroying crotch balls goes into phase 2, maybe try destroying other balls first?
[2:30:18] <%Alazull> You is kind, you is loved, you is smart

[2:30:25] <%Pookiedaexzile> Now Say Unga Bunga
[2:30:27] <%king_wragles> @PeachSaliva You can do it! Just don't play bad!
[2:30:29] <ChrisPlaysThing> You can hear the sounds of Bunga Bunga from the Sewers Kappa if you hear the rums you must run
[2:30:32] <%Too_Much_Nukie> Would it help if Paige took off all her armor and thus embraced her cave woman energy?
[2:30:35] <%maskofmichael> Use the fighting titty
[2:30:38] <ChrisPlaysThing> You can hear the sounds of Bunga Bunga from the Sewers Kappa if you hear the drums you must run
[2:30:41] <%Promessa_EX> Ember
[2:30:42] <+cowardman93> back balls don't count in phase 1
[2:30:44] <BoxNavy> the ballballs
[2:30:45] <%EldritchBee> scrotus
[2:30:46] <+doomunderthestairs> fondle the other tree balls first
[2:30:47] <+cowardman93> just the leg balls
[2:30:48] <$velgaduere> AN ATTEMPT IS BE MADE
[2:30:48] <+FlameLoneWolf> Depends on which phase you find easier

[2:30:49] <TimetodiveLTX> THIS IS THE RUN
[2:30:52] <$Grimlockfly> Big Boobs, Big Heart, Can't lose Party100 Party100
[2:30:52] <laguerrilha> but second part has no adds
[2:30:55] <KeiPrime> save the balls
[2:30:58] <SchroedingersFerret> Removing the head or destroying the balls
[2:30:59] <$SirGO0SE> save your favorite ball for last:)
[2:31:06] <%Alazull> My mans can grow his balls back
[2:31:07] <TimetodiveLTX> even if you don't actually beat it
[2:31:11] <+CSNG> Unrealistic game, balls do not come back
[2:31:15] <$velgaduere> @laguerrilha the arm and the new moves are ostensibly worse, plus he kills the adds in this phase too
[2:31:23] <Srthunda> those hits did count tho
[2:31:25] <+FlameLoneWolf> This is going really well already
[2:31:26] <$shurtal> is Paige wielding the horny stick? to hit the balls?
[2:31:26] <super_robo_mg> "you gotta be tits"
[2:31:27] <Lancaster_H> you GOTTA be tits
[2:31:31] <%KeiganOfAstora> in the as

[2:31:39] <%EldritchBee> CBT this motherfucker
[2:31:40] <%AtlasMcCoy> You GOTTA be tits
[2:31:57] <laguerrilha> the balls on the back do stun him and do dmg
[2:32:05] <+FlameLoneWolf> Guess Music is dead again.
[2:32:06] <Murphio_GS> wait, there's no music?
[2:32:08] <%Ranryu692> I wonder if Paige will still be doing this when I get back from dinner
[2:32:11] <Jogs__> thise jiggle animations tho
[2:32:12] <Sunstalker> Teach Paige the running attack again, I think she's forgotten it
[2:32:12] <Laecerelius> That's some good ball whackin' damage
[2:32:13] <+cowardman93> @laguerrilha not in phase 1
[2:32:19] <+patriotrenegade> why's the music keep bugging out\
[2:32:19] <%bluetocho13> when is Paige's cooking stream
[2:32:25] <%Ranryu692> I'm betting no
[2:32:27] <$velgaduere> THE READ
[2:32:29] <Dhurkst> @shurtal gonna send the great greatwood to horny jail
[2:32:29] <+gespenst25> Who's looking forward to the Nameless King?
[2:32:30] <zehjojo> I remember this boss bugging out on me once where i killed it above ground because the balls would just not burst for some reason.
[2:32:39] <Admiral_PopnFresh> Paige, 2 Swings only!

[2:32:55] <+cowardman93> not crotch balls!
[2:32:57] <RocketRagu> Paige, you must get the Dandruff Stick!
[2:32:59] <%Alazull> When she finds out this was an optional boss she is going to lose her fucking mind
[2:32:59] <$velgaduere> is she immediately abandoning the strategy she said she's do?
[2:33:00] <+Dunmarkh> this music is almost as good as the khezu theme
[2:33:04] <%baka_sugoi> LOOG BOLLZ
[2:33:06] <+FlameLoneWolf> Also, the balls have no sound effect when you hit them

[2:59:08] <+Mendin> @Louie_Salmon I think it only kicks in during R2 attacks
[2:59:11] <Coystick> Use Vordt's hammer with Pyromancy or fire to reset the freeze so it procs more often.
[2:59:12] <%KeiganOfAstora> ENDURANCE
[2:59:12] <Jogs__> poise doesnt exist in DS 3

[3:00:15] <ARDM112> Hollowslayer greatsword is "terrible"? Pat is so fucking stupid sometimes
[3:00:15] <LVL1_Scumbag> It is if you're really strong

[3:00:25] <+patriotrenegade> SKELETONS
[3:00:26] <+snorlaxbud> I mean you can swing a toilet pretty hard
[3:00:27] <Coystick> Mine would be a shotgun
[3:00:27] <%yaboiFenex> poise works in ds3 its just almost entirely useless outside of pvp
[3:00:28] <ShichiNoBushi> Pat's would be a roll of toilet paper.
[3:00:28] <Valentinius_Anodyne> It's a small toilet used as a talisman
[3:00:34] <danknugglit> Anor londo

[3:01:10] <Oak_bogle> Have you seen boon dock saints? Toilet is indeed a weapon

[3:32:09] <+Kitafin> Right down the road
[3:32:11] <LVL1_Scumbag> Oh hey Artorias
[3:32:15] <@commanderclaw> Mr Plinkett voice: Is this a Berserk reference?
[3:32:17] <+snorlaxbud> meaty bnonk
[3:32:17] <skyentombment> Oh man, I can't WAIT for the abyss watchers

[3:32:25] <amonimis> one more bonk
[3:32:28] <+CptBritches> Yes :)
[3:32:30] <+Shadowanroid> BibleThump

[3:32:47] <+DCN2049> yeah those guys suck big butt
[3:32:51] <+FlameLoneWolf> Yeah, that's nonsense
[3:32:54] <$AzureGale> PROTIP: To kill enemies, hit them until they die
[3:32:54] <Djinnazz> not really, just early on.
[3:32:55] <@SSaryn> High health and stamina degradation
[3:32:56] <+Jaysky> Which enemies? I missed out
[3:32:57] <Grimlockfly> it's kinda fucked up that they put there RIGHT after the tree
[3:32:58] <+FlameLoneWolf> Really annoying enemy
[3:32:59] <%Pookiedaexzile> Lets make Artorias a Normal Enemy
[3:33:01] <+DCN2049> "a little much" Come on pat. They suck
[3:33:06] <+paladinstarbuster> they are cool tho
[3:33:06] <Sunstalker> They'd be cool if you were also berserk wolf armor mode
[3:33:06] <+patriotrenegade> NO SUHLYVAHN'S BEASTS ARE THE WORST
[3:33:07] <+ChaosAethr> isn there only 3?
[3:33:11] <BlkFlameKami> :|

[3:33:19] <%Pookiedaexzile> OH NO
[3:33:21] <+FlameLoneWolf> Enemies that just flail around like an annoying shit are the worst in these types of games

[3:33:37] <@SoFarFetched> PogChamp juice gives power
[3:33:37] <peachy996> @patriotrenegade Aren't those beasts just knockoff Hot Dogs from Bloodborne?
[3:33:38] <DracaenaLeaf> Pickle juice is great
[3:33:39] <danielm427> is this a midwester thing?
[3:33:39] <tanarath> brine is good
[3:33:43] <primaryfire> it's just salt water and/vinegar, dude
[3:33:43] <LVL1_Scumbag> Homemade pickle brine is alright
[3:33:44] <%king_wragles> @Lets_frown Klaussen is just great
[3:33:47] <+Seitine> It’s great for a hangover.
[3:33:49] <@SSaryn> God dang it
[3:33:49] <+AbnormalVoid> that's brick house
[3:33:52] <KeiPrime> RATs
[3:33:52] <%Alazull> She's a brick house?
[3:33:53] <+CptBritches> @PeachSaliva There are NFL players that drink pickle juice on the sidelines during games

[3:34:18] <+ScreamLord> HAUOOOS
[3:34:18] <%king_wragles> The Rob Zombie cover of that song sucks ass btw
[3:34:19] <%maskofmichael> AHOUSE
[3:34:20] <scrublordsamurai> she needs to start the embalming process now as she is in the process of decomposing
[3:34:20] <slix3431> God Paige plays this better than Reggie
[3:34:21] <tanarath> @primaryfire not necessarily. You can also actually use salt water instead of vinegar.
[3:34:22] <%SaiyanShoto> A lot of my family members love to drink pickle juice
[3:34:35] <OneThousandTomatoes> oh, poise
[3:34:36] <+FlameLoneWolf> dumb doge
[3:34:36] <peachy996> @king_wragles Yeah it's not a good cover.
[3:34:37] <+CptBritches> "stairs"
[3:34:41] <mostundesired> It's like horses.
[3:34:42] <Mirrorcatch> they can't even look up
[3:34:42] <Perky_LKM> Some dogs cant do stairs either
[3:34:47] <VirtuaRailith> one dog did
[3:34:47] <rekinom> Dogs CAN look uop
[3:34:47] <Dingalow> Dogs can't look up
[3:34:50] <%MechArch> psaCrazyhead
[3:34:51] <Melchior_the_Wise> Space isn't real
[3:34:51] <$heatbugg> dogs cant look up
[3:34:51] <vonmaultke> dogs can't look up
[3:34:52] <primaryfire> @tanarath yea I meant to say salt water and/or vinegar
[3:34:53] <KilljoyHexx> Dogs CAN look up
[3:34:53] <BoxNavy> theyre not
[3:34:54] <+Tucker0603> we had a dog that could pat, I miss sarah
[3:34:54] <@SoFarFetched> I am absolutely real
[3:34:56] <@Jekado> dogs can climb ladders
[3:34:58] <Emperor_Machinus> Space is night time
[3:34:58] <%EyeFarted> RATS CAN'T SWIM
[3:34:59] <@SoFarFetched> geefPoint
[3:35:02] <Maids4lyfe> DOGS CAN CLIMB LADDERS
[3:35:04] <Finakala> People with green eyes can't see dogs
[3:35:05] <@Jekado> its nuts
[3:35:05] <+ScreamLord> Estus can't melt steel beams
[3:35:05] <@SoFarFetched> how dare you paige
[3:35:06] <Ranryu692> not well, anyway
[3:35:10] <scrublordsamurai> or could it?
[3:35:12] <Valentinius_Anodyne> A dog can play football however
[3:35:12] <%maskofmichael> Dogs Can talk
[3:35:13] <%Pookiedaexzile> A Dog wouldn't down load a car
[3:35:14] <%SaiyanShoto> @slix3431 well that’s because she’s played a lot of Souls games. Reggie is on his first one...
[3:35:15] <justinjones1989> How fly without plane?
[3:35:15] <mostundesired> hmmm....
[3:35:16] <+balouie> bear is driving how can that be
[3:35:19] <%baka_sugoi> ROCKS ARNT REAL
[3:35:20] <+MisterAvry> There's nothing in the rules that says a dog can't be a vtuber!
[3:35:21] <@SSaryn> What if Dogs could look up
[3:35:26] <Sapphire_Breeze> @Pookiedaexzile a cat would 100%
[3:35:30] <+AbnormalVoid> god no
[3:35:31] <+redambulant> Dogs can't look up
[3:35:34] <+AbnormalVoid> not even close
[3:35:35] <scrublordsamurai> rember the talking dog in halloween 6?
[3:35:37] <KilljoyHexx> Dogs can look up
[3:35:40] <+AbnormalVoid> Ledo's is best
[3:35:44] <+JenovasPuppet> Paige looking beefy with that mace
[3:35:45] <EuropanLamprey> Ledo's is considered best for WA
[3:35:45] <+JustToWatch> If a dog can learn sign language they can learn martial arts
[3:35:55] <+AbnormalVoid> Spiked Mace could do a big spin combo, but they fucked it up, so it's useless now
[3:36:04] <+CrunchyFrog_> but its kinda easy to backstab the weapon art on ledos
[3:36:09] <+shadowace2400> BOY Eli is echoy
[3:36:17] <EuropanLamprey> Spiked Mace is notable because it's WA is unique thus is has its own niche
[3:36:24] <chhdez> BOSS WAHPONZ
[3:36:25] <+thefancywig> didn't they like, barely buff some of the faith weapons in the final patch
[3:36:30] <+DCN2049> that's because plague is speaking from the dimension between hell-worlds
[3:36:31] <justinjones1989> @JustToWatch Maybe but to risky to test
[3:36:37] <$EldritchBee> My fav was always the Quakestone hammer
[3:36:54] <BlkFlameKami> TIT!?
[3:36:54] <+TheSaintJohn> wow
[3:36:55] <BoxNavy> tits!
[3:36:56] <djblue_shift> WOW

[3:36:57] <@SSaryn> Unga sipsipGasm sipsipGasm sipsipGasm
[3:36:57] <%SilvaChariot0133> psaCrazyhand psaCrazyhead
[3:36:58] <EuropanLamprey> @CrunchyFrog_ not if you know what you're doing

[3:37:05] <%YakumoYomi> Lucky
[3:37:06] <DrStinkers> perfect for paige
[3:37:07] <+Pharmakokinetic> that was so greedy at the end and it worked lmao
[3:37:14] <+JustToWatch> MASH HARDER
[3:37:16] <%baka_sugoi> BONGA UNGA
[3:37:19] <wibbwobbler> even that guy was like wtf
[3:37:21] <KeiPrime> bonk
[3:37:22] <user_naim> Fucking Unga Bunga
[3:37:22] <+TechnicolorNinja> Brute smarts
[3:37:22] <%Ranryu692> it's a dead man's party
[3:37:33] <scrublordsamurai> @plaugeofgripes i love your hipster first flame
[3:37:38] <laguerrilha> Now poise ignores even great sword hits
[3:37:43] <fruit_pie_the_magician> Also frost didn't used to exist
[3:37:44] <Melchior_the_Wise> I super hate this whole area
[3:37:44] <dan_g_v> oonga bunga
[3:37:47] <Finakala> Can she level up?
[3:37:49] <$SvenHolgersson> This area sucksssssssssssssssss
[3:37:52] <Melchior_the_Wise> every swamp in every souls game
[3:37:53] <$SvenHolgersson> Enjoy!
[3:37:55] <+AbnormalVoid> poise originally didn't do fucking shit, now it adds hyperarmor, which sucks ass still, but its something
[3:37:58] <Coystick> Birdie
[3:37:58] <EuropanLamprey> Poise worked, people just didn't understand it, and Perserverence works indipentent of Poise, which is why its good
[3:38:00] <@SoFarFetched> geefGasp
[3:38:02] <BoxNavy> you dont like it
[3:38:03] <Finakala> That damage tho
[3:38:05] <%Pookiedaexzile> Don't gotta ask if you kill it
[3:38:06] <primaryfire> the outrider knight is literally harder than the greatwood
[3:38:07] <@SoFarFetched> paige hates birds
[3:38:07] <+twohitgood> it's corvid 19
[3:38:08] <+FlameLoneWolf> He was just saying hi BibleThump
[3:38:08] <Perky_LKM> Poise worked but was 100% worthless outside of going against someone using an ultra greatweapon while you were using one yourself. because of breakpoints.
[3:38:10] <+AbnormalVoid> the DPS of heavy weapons compared to fast weapons is garbage
[3:38:13] <+mecha_11> Eh this area is not that bad
[3:38:14] <+patriotrenegade> awful creatures
[3:38:14] <KeiPrime> a glorbian?
[3:38:18] <CandyCoatedConfection> LUL
[3:38:19] <laserbeaming> the only weapon arts I used was the swords with stances
[3:38:21] <%LiquidDinosaur> I love this area, to be honest. It really captures the feel of a forest. Too many things dont show dead leaves on the ground
[3:38:21] <BoxNavy> thats how it work
[3:38:25] <%vehementvadr> yup
[3:38:26] <+ScreamLord> They're from A Painted World
[3:38:28] <ahaegotrigger> oh fuck off I dont want my bird ass to turn into that
[3:38:30] <OneThousandTomatoes> they hired an animator
[3:38:33] <Sunstalker> They used to have a nice ass but then they got rid of it.
[3:38:35] <$AzureGale> Is that the actual canon
[3:38:40] <Sunstalker> For extra wings
[3:38:42] <Valentinius_Anodyne> More explanation than the games gives anyhow
[3:38:45] <+AbnormalVoid> smashy smashy
[3:38:46] <peachy996> just mop up the corvian that spilled out of th painting
[3:38:49] <justinjones1989> Oh yeah
[3:38:50] <%Pookiedaexzile> Yes
[3:38:51] <laguerrilha> ? arent they beasts from the country the dancer is from?
[3:38:55] <corepercentlives> in dark Souls plot anything goes
[3:38:55] <@SSaryn> Hard or just gross Kappa
[3:38:55] <+patriotrenegade> theyre annoying
[3:38:55] <Monkeyweed21> they hired a lady to restore the painting and then she did a bad job painting jesus
[3:38:58] <CandyCoatedConfection> she actually has the perfect weapon for this area
[3:39:00] <+thefancywig> they turn into ASSHOLES if they transform
[3:39:01] <Valentinius_Anodyne> They'll fuck you up if they get you first
[3:39:12] <ahaegotrigger> if they jump on you they might full combo
[3:39:18] <Perky_LKM> Just farm the BS staff with the broken super poison.
[3:39:19] <$AzureGale> PROTIP: To not get hit, hit them before they hit you
[3:39:23] <+CptBritches> NICE

[3:40:55] <slix3431> SMOrc SMOrc SMOrc
[3:40:56] <CommanderButtFace> Kind of shocked that Paige hasn't played DS3 until now
[3:40:59] <Dingalow> Pat distracted Paige smdh
[3:41:04] <Melchior_the_Wise> Mildred Maneater
[3:41:04] <Jrocy247> THICC
[3:41:07] <%Pookiedaexzile> She can Unga your Bunga
[3:41:08] <+MisterAvry> She's a maneater
[3:41:09] <+mecha_11> She came so close too
[3:41:09] <Bouerd> Vordt's hammer is so strong for how early you get it
[3:41:10] <Monkeyweed21> MIldred the Maneater
[3:41:12] <+TopTieramisu> "axe"
[3:41:12] <BoxNavy> thats kinda hot
[3:41:15] <Paperware> She throws poop at you too
[3:41:17] <LVL1_Scumbag> Cleaver
[3:41:19] <%EyeFarted> SHE GOT GAT CAKE
[3:41:20] <+snorlaxbud> She's a maneater
[3:41:20] <%LiquidDinosaur> is that supposed to be Mildred?
[3:41:20] <anAngryHamster> Frost was absolutely underutilized in this game
[3:41:21] <user_naim> Milly from the Hilly
[3:41:25] <Valentinius_Anodyne> It's a big ol butcher's knife
[3:41:25] <Finakala> Maneater, she's been in DS1 and DeS from what I recall
[3:41:31] <LVL1_Scumbag> But it's not an axe
[3:41:32] <%goatbait> DeS too???
[3:41:34] <+MisterAvry> Whoa oh, here she comes. Watch out, Paige, she'll chew you up
[3:41:34] <destinyspider> Aren't there supposed to be NPCs left to the bonfire?
[3:41:37] <%LiquidDinosaur> Maneater Mildred is waifu
[3:41:40] <+cdrom321> Frostbite: Deals 11% of a player's max HP plus an additional 85 flat damage. -15 Stamina Regen and +7% increased damage.
[3:41:40] <super_robo_mg> "sometimes"
[3:41:42] <Finakala> Not to be confused with Maneaters, which are a boss
[3:41:43] <Coystick> Voice of God of Gripes
[3:41:45] <EuropanLamprey> Butcher Knife, it was god like in DS2 but its just okayish here
[3:41:47] <Valentinius_Anodyne> Constant echo actually

[3:57:05] <+wampa661> GG Paige! You beat Greatwood and made progress!
[3:57:07] <orcstr16> We know too little about the dark to completely decry them as evil. Plus, no other options really exist at this point anyway. Might as well juice the big dark to try something new.
[3:57:10] <+gespenst25> the darksoul was the friends we made along the way

[3:58:08] <%SilvaChariot0133> Reggie the Chosen One
[3:58:13] <+Cobaltor_252> I liked the part where punching the skeletons did more damage

[3:58:23] <+wampa661> Reggie almost did two full zones today
[3:58:23] <Monkeyweed21> Reggie made way more progress than you
[3:58:25] <%ssjklyco> One optional boss and one friend killed

[3:59:05] <peachy996> It's hard to pinpoint what Reggie will be like for these Souls games. He's neither the blunt force like you nor is he a defensive poke like Woolie
