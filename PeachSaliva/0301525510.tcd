[0:02:11] <+TsundereHunter> Why does she always wait until she‚Äôs sick to stream?
[0:02:12] <shieldecho> maybe dont play a game with puzzles that are known to frustrate you if you dont feel well...?
[0:02:14] <stigna1> @Volkrotia He says sometime on the weekend.
[0:02:15] <+skizzuto> good for me; i'm unwell as well and will probably go to bed early. Thanks for streaming even a little though!
[0:02:16] <Mr_LupLup> Sex gets boring after a while, I know
[0:02:18] <%logus313> Im using the WWE definition of not well and assume you're on steroids.
[0:02:19] <%Djinnazz> @PeachSaliva Did you eat?
[0:02:20] <+Grindaviking> After Paige beat Portal 1, God knew he had to give her another handicap
[0:02:23] <Benpower236> Someone hasn't been taking their drug cauldron.
[0:02:26] <epylepticpanda> Todays stream is 20 mins of looping, 30 mins of thanking subs, 2 hours of Portal 2 and 1 hour of staring at Elmo while saying toot and honk honk
[0:02:27] <megamonmon123> paige has HAD SEX?!?!?
[0:02:29] <stigna1> God, I wish I could fire up something that is both video games and social and feel productive.
[0:02:30] <+Bupkis7> for GROFIT
[0:02:32] <ancrest_tant> You guys should probably check your mic cables to make sure they are still good. Band cables tend to make noise

[0:13:14] <element_of_loyalty> ITS IS

[0:13:16] <Gehtingsberg> Yes
[0:13:18] <megamonmon123> okay guys, who is the best x men and why is it nightcrawler
[0:13:18] <@thenefftw> BECAUSE FUCK YOU
[0:13:19] <fussyphuk> old man alert
[0:13:19] <%TheGershon> It is also SHARP in terms of music
[0:13:19] <Benpower236> Pound sign best sign.
[0:13:19] <ECRead> i hate it... I hate food industry too
[0:13:19] <+AmaniIsYourBoss> Pat, we need you, get in here. #fuckretail
[0:13:20] <TerraWraith> Because we're old Pat
[0:13:20] <sovennix> same thing got name changed

[0:13:22] <%TheOnlyStrayCat> cheer1000 I knew that, even after dinner, you dorks would not have even started the game yet. Oh well, I made it anyways! With food in my belly and editing finishing for my YouTube stuff tomorrow! State of Decay 2 Saturday hype!
[0:13:22] <$magicalhades> its context
[0:13:23] <StalwartZephyr> Hashtag is a cultural change in reading symbols
[0:13:23] <NiftyNox> octothorpe
[0:13:24] <Ninjagregory98> Programming
[0:13:24] <@MelBrooksKA> It's also an Octothorp
[0:13:24] <$MonsterEnvy> cheer100 cheer100
[0:13:25] <%Keyd00d> pound that shit
[0:13:26] <DracaenaLeaf> hashtag is a dumb twitter thing :(
[0:13:26] <%galaxyswirl> its the same and its stupid as fuck
[0:13:26] <+CaptainJax> what is the point of pound
[0:13:27] <element_of_loyalty> #b Pound DIS
[0:13:27] <DandyMackeroos> @skatedeandre Wesker for Global Saturation?
[0:13:28] <+Skatedeandre> It‚Äôs both
[0:13:30] <The_Blumper> Pat attepts to lear what the kids do
[0:13:31] <%RadicalWeegee> its how you use it its also a SHARP note when you write for music
[0:13:33] <+SailingSaturn> The Youths cirBaka
[0:13:35] <%redstonej> SO OLD
[0:13:35] <Gehtingsberg> Different name
[0:13:37] <crimsonharvest> hashtag is a metadata tag for the content in the post
[0:13:38] <stigna1> Yes. Its also a number sign. The same symbol has different uses in different context, much like how "-" can be dash or minus.
[0:13:38] <$magicalhades> its the octothorpe you fucks
[0:13:39] <+Blain_Cooper> Twitter appropriated the symbol
[0:13:40] <ShadeTheNovice> Hashtag is twitter speak
[0:13:40] <$mandragoraroot> nope
[0:13:43] <%GeneralSCPatton> I think a hashtag is the symbol and the corresponding text it is attached to.
[0:13:45] <@WoolyFish> @PeachSaliva It's because Americans don't know how to speak English.
[0:13:45] <Gary_Plays_Games> push the hashtag on the phone
[0:13:46] <somnibrew> it's the hash key
[0:13:46] <ziggythehutt> The # key is for old losers who aren't cool and hip with the times
[0:13:47] <VanLynx> thats about right
[0:13:49] <leole11> hashtag is for millenials
[0:13:49] <+CrystalLakeWasJusASetback> Hastag is just twitter talk.
[0:13:50] <%FriedMattato> It upsets me knowing rotary phones "don't exist anymore"
[0:13:51] <Ell1ot> Because people didn't know it was called Pound and they wanted hashbrowns
[0:13:51] <element_of_loyalty> "Press the Pound Sign"
[0:13:51] <+blademaster247> Pat, you're old
[0:13:53] <Rellim80> Phone verses original name
[0:13:53] <heatrashes> NO ive said push the hashtag and ive gotten laughed at before... its still a pound key. youre not too old, pat
[0:13:54] <+Woefully_Inept> "hashtag" came with social media

[0:13:59] <+Skatedeandre> @dandymackeroos oh my god if he could work that into his motto
[0:13:59] <+Blain_Cooper> ALSO SHARP
[0:13:59] <%redstonej> WHY?
[0:14:00] <@MelBrooksKA> https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/octothorpe
[0:14:04] <stigna1> So old, lel.
[0:14:06] <%Keyd00d> Hashtag FE
[0:14:06] <%ssjklyco> Its how you can tell how old someone is when they say Pound or Hashtag
[0:14:07] <%galaxyswirl> SHARP
[0:14:08] <megamonmon123> pat is OLDDDDDD
[0:14:10] <TerraWraith> @PeachSaliva It's because we're old. I used to be with it. But then they changed what "it" was. AND IT WILL HAPPEN TO YOU

[0:14:18] <AncelDeLambert> Andromeda should never have been made
[0:14:20] <+TaifuDragon> @PeachSaliva Some of our old phones used to tell you to call "star ten hash" for your inbox. The symbol was called hash and then was made into a tag tool for twitter I guess
[0:14:21] <+Skatedeandre> Which is worse though retail or fast food?
[0:14:24] <$OdysseyKnight> It was boring
[0:14:27] <Spydurman> 5/10

[0:32:14] <+Dingus_Tickler> My favorite part about Woolie reading letters for the podcast is that Matt and Pat made up lore that Woolie just makes up shit as he goes because he's illiterate and can't read. So he's just been making up shit for the past 4-5 years worth of podcasts
[0:32:14] <AFlyingTaco1> Getting bullied by the class idiot. Only in Pat's life.

[0:41:56] <stigna1> @lamplight_ I hesitate to ask but...what does that mean?
[0:42:02] <+Sirculbs> Shortness is good for a lower center of gravity tho. Us tall bastards have a higher risk of falling over.
[0:42:03] <@WoolyFish> She just started and I'm already frustrated.
[0:42:04] <rytisone> laser can shoot through glass
[0:42:04] <+Grayhammatter> she has no plan

[0:42:21] <latgeek> maybe they should've made it so turret lasers go through glass so it teaches you any laser can go through glass.

[0:42:51] <stigna1> @Sirculbs Tall people also have shorter lifespan due to greater heart stress, walk into things, get asked to reach thins for people, get wet sooner when it rains, spine issues ect. Its not all upside.

[0:44:49] <+PipIV> you can DO iiiit
[0:44:50] <stigna1> Does she know how black vs white tiles work? I feel like that could be an underlying systemic thing if she got distracted during the learning moment.
[0:44:50] <Benpower236> Paige's brain is also a block.
[0:44:53] <Donchalant402> Im really excited for her to get to test 17, that one had me stuck for like a half hour
[0:44:56] <latgeek> oh my god I just realized there's a glass pane like THREE FEET from the laser emitter, to teach you lasers go through glass.
[0:44:57] <AtlasMcCoy> "So you didnt actually have any problems with the puzzles last time."
[0:44:57] <rubini98> This hurts me

[0:50:18] <$urdumb4twitching> controller makes this game soooo much better
[0:50:20] <cerberuscarmine> huh?
[0:50:23] <Cheapheatmo> big picturr
[0:50:25] <firemahci93> Why all the horse porn though?
[0:50:26] <SeventyForce> hUH?
[0:50:28] <Mythundare> huh?
[0:50:28] <alwayspronking> LUL
[0:50:32] <DOTHETHINGBRUH> LUL
[0:50:34] <Fujiwara_92> LUL
[0:50:35] <+Clik404> HUH?
[0:50:36] <$ThePuddingDead> @PeachSaliva Feeling ok tonight love? We'd understand if you have to call it soon.
[0:50:36] <Laironx3> OhMyDog
[0:50:37] <%HelveticaScenario> brave_sj Because controllers are better
[0:50:37] <%SuperCasualBoom> Paige speaks in hah and ohs
[0:50:39] <%AstroFalcon09> LUL
[0:50:42] <SulfurousAcid> why would you handicap yourself with a control
[0:50:44] <$magicalhades> implying KB/M is superior
[0:50:44] <+Nomicro4u> Now she will never finish the room
[0:50:45] <DandyMackeroos> Who's been downloading nipples?
[0:50:45] <SulfurousAcid> er
[0:50:47] <jinkipng> thats a big tiny hat porn collection pat
[0:50:49] <+sundizzle> I don't think that answered the question LUL
[0:50:50] <+PipIV> you work with what you got
[0:50:58] <+krawtch> pat downloaded those ten boobs he talked about
[0:50:59] <Benpower236> Why bother saving all you did was walk through a door?!
[0:51:00] <gorsuch> i have never not played this game with a controller
[0:51:01] <B_S_H> no pinch grip vertical pressure not horizontal pressure say your wrist
[0:51:02] <SulfurousAcid> that makes sense
[0:51:05] <$magikestral> kb/m is superior but portal 2 doesn't need speed
[0:51:05] <+CaptainJax> hee ho
[0:51:06] <+PipIV> @dandymackeroos only nips?
[0:51:07] <$guessingtwo> motion blur
[0:51:09] <$guessingtwo> my god
[0:51:16] <+brave_sj> @HelveticaScenario maybe for racing games or platformers, not for first person
[0:51:16] <%damienlunas> sipsipSipsipblind sipsipSipsipblind sipsipSipsipblind sipsipSipsipblind
[0:51:21] <+ghor7> This ain‚Äôt CSGO
[0:51:21] <%Remery_> Paige's wrists are alike Shaun's neck
[0:51:22] <Donchalant402> @PeachSaliva disable the steam controller support for your controller type and the in-engine controller support works just fine. Better even in my opinion.
[0:51:24] <cerberuscarmine> get rid of motion blur plz
[0:51:27] <%SuperCasualBoom> Is it a wrist she willing to take? ü§£
[0:51:27] <DandyMackeroos> @pipiv Yes
[0:51:28] <Sowlith> this bit of game design feels like it could be clearer that the laser is going through glass, there's so much glass it's easy to get lost
[0:51:28] <cerberuscarmine> D:
[0:51:28] <+Grayhammatter> now, shoot the gloss
[0:51:29] <SulfurousAcid> I forgot this game had zoom
[0:51:31] <SeventyForce> I think she might just get sick on this
[0:51:31] <CptBritches> Pat the genuis
[0:51:31] <latgeek> A tenkeyless keyboard and lapdesk with room for a mouse would improve your couch experience a lot, @PeachSaliva
[0:51:35] <%rdark_ksu> good job pat
[0:51:35] <+krawtch> Leo
[0:51:37] <Benpower236> There we go. Controllers. All is well.
[0:51:41] <leole11> shoot dah glass
[0:51:42] <firemahci93> Is it abuse if a handicaped person plays games?
[0:51:43] <+PipIV> @dandymackeroos alrighty then
[0:51:44] <+krawtch> Leo's neck is worse than Jason
[0:51:45] <+d00msdaydan> how is she doing everything but putting the cube in the laser
[0:51:46] <@WoolyFish> Now back to our scheduled programming of "AAAAAAHHHHHH"
[0:51:46] <Boopamann> Lasers can go through glass

[1:04:06] <DOTHETHINGBRUH> Honestly i think Teostra is the easiest because his gimmick is just more damage, compared to Val's health shit and Kush's wind.

[1:05:33] <+willtheprofessional> The lore in Portal is awesome. Like the fact that the reason turrets take so long to kill you is because there's no gun, they're throwing the bullets at you at high speeds cause they just filled them up with bullets and had no room for GUN.

[1:21:57] <%SuperCasualBoom> Little did we know, all their donations is to fund their rings and wedding.
[1:21:57] <firemahci93> Pat would hide the ring in a bag of candy inside of the closet

[2:11:13] <+CaptainJax> WHAT HAS SCIENCE DONE
[2:11:14] <+RafflesiaA> Wow Chell just fucked this place all the way up
[2:11:15] <+blademaster247> So it IS your fault
[2:11:15] <pectusumbra> potatoes are great
[2:11:15] <$joylent_blue> never knew that, huh
[2:11:17] <+Tylord92> Potato dad has spawned many veggie children.
[2:11:18] <Fujiwara_92> yeah, killed
[2:11:20] <OkamiDude15> the greenest of thumbs
[2:11:21] <santafer> NAH; CHELL IS ADOPTED
[2:11:21] <+Elexius> Wow i didnt know that AT ALL. I always thought Chell was just a random person.
[2:11:21] <zal_silverfang> wait, so that means her parent WERE apart of this company
[2:11:22] <MyNameIsRasus> Chell is Plague confirmed
[2:11:23] <CptBritches> GLaDOS BEST GIRL
[2:11:26] <Neo_Kaiser> Pat thinks a single potato can grow a jungle
[2:11:27] <+Youwereeatenbyalid> FOR ONCE PAT DOESN'T TRIGGER CRAZY TALK
[2:11:28] <+Virokwet> and the lemons, dont forget the lemons pat
[2:11:29] <BlindGato> DEADLY NEUROTOXIN
[2:11:29] <frozenottsel> Chell is Ra9
[2:11:32] <SGrim> Everything is one big potato. Just like Paige's brain. rooKek
[2:11:34] <DirtyDeedsDunDirtCheap> ...Well shit, then Pat. Always gotta mention the dead parents...
[2:11:35] <latgeek> Wait, is every single piece of foliage in P2 modeled after potato plants?
[2:11:35] <arcaderabbit48> And Chell has been fucking with Aperture since she was 10
[2:11:36] <+pkmamsters> Chell's my favorite farmer
[2:11:37] <gyrogogozeppeli> Chell smarter than Kamski

[2:11:52] <buffmurffy> calculus is fun
[2:11:52] <Hydrapissed> 2+2=5
[2:11:53] <ricksaintriot> dunno how potatoes, or any plant, can grow this deep underground, with no sunlight
[2:11:54] <+xxviios> Yeah i failed pre-algebra twice in college
[2:11:54] <%bloodypurpledog> Its safe to assume Chells parents were turned into potatoes
[2:11:54] <MyNameIsRasus> Chell probably hates Blooeborne
[2:11:54] <%rdark_ksu> I damn near have learned helplessness when it comes to math
[2:11:55] <%SoarFlyer> @Neo_Kaiser Show me a picture of one NOT being able to grow a jungle. You can't.

[2:12:50] <+SailingSaturn> He rammed a glass door too
[2:12:51] <Benpower236> Never know when a company might need some neurotoxin.
[2:12:52] <$Mendin> Did you not notice him hacking that glass door in the turret room?
[2:12:52] <omenesia> Wheatley is beating himself up by hacking
[2:12:53] <Cheapheatmo> yeah Wheatley's definitely not deteriorating mentally, dont' worry about it
[2:12:53] <Jalexster> This part breaks the game's own established rules
[2:12:54] <Endocrom> -'s daughter
[2:12:55] <BeansAreFunnyhaha> he also rammed his whole body into a window

[2:28:09] <VritraReiRei> @PeachSaliva can you ask Peach if she recognized the "voice?" Both of them?
[2:28:09] <%Keyd00d> THE NAME OF THE GAME IS PORTAL
[2:28:11] <Hydrapissed> Wish I was a charming idiot
[2:28:11] <GPAlpha> But Pat, you're already a heel
[2:28:12] <Graxe_> There is a civil war going on in the Best Friends subreddit about Wesker's super speed teleports.
[2:28:12] <CptBritches> THE GAME IS CALLED PORTAL
[2:28:12] <RushUnplugged> PAT you betray everyone every single day of your life.

[2:29:18] <Donchalant402> CANONICALLY Wesker JUST going really fast, but thats not how it functions in game
[2:29:20] <Gary_Plays_Games> is she blind
[2:29:20] <arcaderabbit48> She's getting lost in a straight hallway for fuck's sake!

[2:29:38] <grayjammer> Honestly, fuck the placement of white walls in this area. This place too gotdam big
[2:29:39] <$jorgamund> the game developers clearly failed, with their "light sources will make things clear for everyone!" FailFish

[2:29:47] <swyvar> I'm half expecting Rakghouls down here
[2:29:49] <+Grayhammatter> paige needs big eye exams
[2:29:51] <%maskedriderhero> Also the fact that later on in the series, RBC learns her route. She got lost because she's a ditz and a newbie
[2:29:58] <DirtyDeedsDunDirtCheap> You're trying! And that's all that matters!
[2:30:02] <NeroInfinite> they didn't expect paige to be also blind.
[2:30:03] <$guessingtwo> @jorgamund is it really a failure of the game designer if the player is literally blind
[2:30:05] <sosuke5> She actually didn't call you 'fat'

[2:30:31] <ricksaintriot> Let's Propose
[2:30:32] <BeansAreFunnyhaha> this is the part of the game where you can't judge paige for not knowing where to go
[2:30:32] <Cheapheatmo> god this MUSIC IS SO GOOD
[2:30:34] <Bionicghost> zoom button paige
[2:30:36] <benjiFG> make the sensitivity higher so Paige can accidentally find the way forward
[2:30:37] <%maskedriderhero> Plus sickle cells don't get lost in the blood stream, they clog it up. RBC never does that
[2:30:39] <Wyrmsblood> My son is also named Condemned
[2:30:39] <element_of_loyalty> HONK
[2:30:41] <+Walopoh> OSt of both games is A1
[2:30:42] <JohnJackJohnson> How does it have shit on fire aswell
[2:30:44] <Benpower236> You have to trust the dark walls Paige. Theres no wbite in the pit.
[2:30:47] <$jorgamund> @guessingtwo this stream is a scientific test of that question Kappa
[2:30:47] <+BoboDaHobo> LOOK FOR LIGHT
[2:30:48] <Ell1ot> When is Paige playing Detroit?
[2:30:50] <+Youwereeatenbyalid> All the way up top
[2:30:51] <Bionicghost> use da zoom
[2:30:51] <DirtyDeedsDunDirtCheap> One room's probably just a box of rare sickness, that's how condemned this shit is.
[2:30:53] <AImano97> sickle cells wouldn't be confused about where their going while ion the bood stream, they just cant carry the appropriate amount of oxygen because they're misshaped
[2:30:54] <sosuke5> Dig up

[2:30:55] <+Youwereeatenbyalid> and to her left

[2:31:02] <%SoarFlyer> @Donchalant402 because Wheatley is in charge of the power now
[2:31:03] <fakemalegamer> DIG UP
[2:31:03] <+Youwereeatenbyalid> dig up stupid
[2:31:04] <+Mittensbro> How has Paige played this many hours of both games and still doesn't understand that white walls mean portal surfaces
[2:31:09] <arcaderabbit48> @Donchalant402 Aperture has not made a single sound design decision in their entire life as a collective company. They've got power going to areas of the compound that don't even exist!
[2:31:09] <gorsuch> i am so. excited.
[2:31:12] <turf_wind_and_fire> To be fair that is completely counter-intuitive to what the rest of the game has taught
[2:31:17] <hero1151> Paige walks around lime she gonna take fall damage

[2:48:54] <Worldbrand> aperture science: fused human and insects and a gun that bends space. black mesa: started full-scale alien invasion

[3:09:01] <ricksaintriot> A few around Kingston, several Denny's around Toronto.
[3:09:03] <Solidus_113> Is Paige part dog? It would explain her inability to look up
[3:09:04] <krabthecrab> Denny just likes to watch

[3:41:53] <%TheFilth> momentum seems to be a blind spot in this stream

[3:42:11] <ricksaintriot> there are lots of blind spots in this stream, such as portals
[3:42:12] <AncelDeLambert> You require momentum, Paige

[3:44:02] <BeansAreFunnyhaha> remember that other time you had to place a portal while falling through two different portals
[3:44:02] <%Metballs> Think with portals
[3:44:04] <fingalights> Remember what you don't remember
[3:44:04] <Batsmak> you had it right with the portals on the ground and jumping to fling into the air
[3:44:06] <%doc_ock_rokc> Elmo is the best stream cat
[3:44:07] <CptBritches> Elmo is disappointed in you, Paige

[3:44:21] <Onitus> Pat turned into Elmo?!!?
[3:44:21] <+AlopekisPup> You guys think Elmo is convinced that it's just normal to have a skeleton in your house?
[3:44:21] <BirdonSpark> pat get back in there and wash your hands!
[3:44:21] <MrPedrovsky> USE TIMESTOP
[3:44:22] <+Gohyakuen> use portals to solve this portal puzzle
[3:44:23] <MonocledGhost> same here
[3:44:24] <Dr_mr_wang> BACKWARDS
[3:44:24] <Wyrmsblood> The fact that she figured it out by accident is ridiculous
