[1:19:10] <%Kenzo2000> Paige is protesting no hotdog by playing badly on purpose
[1:19:13] <%rantabant> rantabant subscribed with Twitch Prime. 
[1:19:13] <VirtuaRailith> Paige does very well for someone that plays the game once every 2 months
[1:19:16] <theamazingroberto> apparently the first boss of the evening, Paige, was only transitioning into phase 2'
[1:19:17] <SirKeigan> I've thought I was many times but I'm not sure
[1:19:18] <audrus> rust
[1:19:19] <theobble> The HYPEST gameplay on TWITCH
[1:19:19] <%AncelDeLambert> she has to sit to actually fix the armor, right? We're going to recieve this joy, right?
[1:19:20] <MetalSlimeHunt> Logic dictates that if this DS2 playthrough takes long enough, eventually Paige will be the best active DS2 player in the world Kappa

[1:20:03] <Hydrapissed> ima go get some drank for this stream cause woof
[1:20:03] <MetalSlimeHunt> This is way, way, WAY worse than vanilla DS2 Shrine.
[1:20:04] <Shindy7> well that depends if its iron(ii)oxide or iron(iii)oxide
[1:20:10] <@SoFarFetched> I just bowed the shit out of this area.
[1:20:11] <$arcielardor> turn off the camera if you want Pat to hot dog you.
[1:20:13] <SirKeigan> They basically did everything else before HP and Endurance

[1:26:01] <+doc_ock_rokc> Try arm
[1:26:03] <%AncelDeLambert> RIGHT ARM
[1:26:04] <%QueequegTheater> @PeachSaliva Sprint sideways when he rears up
[1:26:05] <ha2ken> Boss used water fun
[1:26:07] <+Massimoman64> this boss always feels out of place to me in the world for some reason
[1:26:07] <causewaybob> Just hit it
[1:26:08] <nauskills> This boss is just a big old man's foreskin
[1:26:10] <Murphio_GS> You're not supposed to sit there and let them hit you, you're supposed to be bouncing around and dodging everything
[1:26:10] <sniffy77> You gotta hit it when its not in its foreskin
[1:26:10] <@SoFarFetched> @taren817 this is the first run
[1:26:10] <ha2ken> Gun
[1:26:11] <+Invlux> that skeleton is wearing a frog as a hoodie

[1:26:26] <+BoxNavy> thats alot of damage
[1:26:27] <ShichiNoBushi> That's fair given it has invulnerabily states.
[1:26:27] <%AncelDeLambert> well nerts
[1:26:28] <+storebrandcandy> you got frog touch
[1:26:29] <$Sphincter_Spelunker> speaking of bris, that frog is uncut
[1:26:30] <krabthecrab> The Shrine is the real boss, this boss is a chump
[1:26:31] <Kalcom> waow
[1:26:31] <+taren817> @SoFarFetched Ah, I see, I thought she'd played it multiple times before. But that was probably Pat
[1:26:32] <peachy996> for as cool as it looks it's attacks are rather goofy looking
[1:26:33] <SirKeigan> Now that you know there's boss there, you can run past everyone straight for the boss
[1:26:34] <+LiquidDinosaur> YOU GOTTA BRISS IT, PAIGE
[1:26:34] <Sagebacca> Forsen Build LUL
[1:26:34] <%YakumoYomi> Do it nine times!
[1:26:37] <Cryomancer_Maurice> Or don't and just go to the left.
[1:26:37] <penitentpentwitch> She really stopped at the worst point to stop at
[1:26:38] <LoneFonte> did the boss just squirt?
[1:26:39] <cipher758> FUN
[1:26:39] <+LailahQueenx> turn off online
[1:26:40] <%Royalguard22> If only she had a shield
[1:26:40] <CappuccinoGuil> DARK SOULS, BABY

[1:26:44] <Murphio_GS> Fun fun fun
[1:26:45] <+zamatermort> You have to hit them Woolie
[1:26:45] <SirKeigan> @peachsaliva now you can just run straight tot he boss
[1:26:45] <Melchior_the_Wise> Go grandma Go!
[1:26:49] <mathbertoldo> Hooray, you fell for the oldest trick in the Dark Souls book, the follow up attack.
[1:26:49] <Melchior_the_Wise> you can do it
[1:26:53] <%optimasmaximas> WHY
[1:26:53] <%AncelDeLambert> good news, folks, we may see her armor break yet
[1:26:56] <%optimasmaximas> WHY WOMAN
[1:26:56] <+LouieRouie> do it again but better
[1:26:58] <skyentombment> This is, along with the Prince at the Earthen Peak, the easiest boss in the game
[1:26:58] <%TheWinged7> you can do it paige
[1:26:58] <Finakala> You can actually just run straight left and kill the one mage, that's it
[1:27:01] <+Aleate> You see Paige, this fight is like a burger... psaCrazyhead
[1:27:02] <cosmicgoatee> good stream, how long before the inevitable Fall Guys give up
[1:27:03] <+demon1103> like I said....boss is BS(likes to one shot)...but not exactly a "hard" fight
[1:27:03] <+LiquidDinosaur> why is item durability a thing?
[1:27:04] <codycurry52> do you really need Super heavy armor and super heavy shield?
[1:27:04] <ha2ken> The true Dark Souls were all the times we died along the way
[1:27:04] <audrus> big big big strong strong strong
[1:27:05] <%realm_forge> All of a sudden Paige misses fall guys
[1:27:07] <causewaybob> psaCanada
[1:27:10] <PanicSwytch> JUST RUN STRAIGHT THERE
[1:27:11] <+LiquidDinosaur> what does it add to the gameplay experience
[1:27:14] <Cryomancer_Maurice> This is awful tech.
[1:27:17] <Shindy7> @LiquidDinosaur why is it?
[1:27:18] <Jontman42> the secret tech of avoiding the enemy projectiles
[1:27:26] <%patriotrenegade> What odds are we thinking on the NPC invader whacking her
[1:27:27] <+Blargimazombie> Use gem
[1:27:28] <CappuccinoGuil> Dark Souls: The cover shooter
[1:27:28] <laserbeaming> when she finishes she'll be halfway through the game right?
[1:27:30] <sakeydo> you sure you up for this? Fun day for stress I guess. Lol
[1:27:35] <+BoxNavy> :)
[1:27:36] <CanadianAnimatorGuy> "just never get hit"
[1:27:36] <+LiquidDinosaur> @Shindy7 yes in what way does durability enrich the gameplay experience
[1:27:37] <theamazingroberto> now that paige has seen the door and knows where to go she should be able to do the run
[1:27:40] <Jontman42> well the general you can but not sure if YOU can
[1:27:41] <%AncelDeLambert> now PAT is the One Guy!!
[1:27:42] <theamazingroberto> if you commit to it from the start
[1:27:42] <CappuccinoGuil> slow and steady
[1:27:45] <+BoxNavy> good one chatroom
[1:27:46] <SirKeigan> not fast enough

[1:27:48] <%AncelDeLambert> psa1guy psa1guy psa1guy
[1:27:50] <$Agami23> maybe if you ran and blocked instead of rolled?
[1:27:50] <+doc_ock_rokc> Killed by old woolie
[1:27:51] <Kalcom> "run"
[1:27:55] <Cryomancer_Maurice> You cannot stop to HIT THEM. Keep going!
[1:27:55] <%optimasmaximas> you totally coulda made it
[1:27:56] <%patriotrenegade> thats an NPC
[1:27:57] <%Lunarhawk> that last one was an npc tho
[1:27:58] <Finakala> Pretty sure *that* was the actual NPC invader
[1:27:58] <$Sphincter_Spelunker> round the outside, round the outside
[1:27:58] <%optimasmaximas> youre just bad
[1:27:59] <Sagebacca> not at that equipload
[1:28:04] <bulletclubbenny> Death number 8
[1:28:04] <Djinnazz> They are now.
[1:28:05] <Melchior_the_Wise> No way, people would never do that

[1:28:20] <StreamStopA> but what if did stay online?
[1:28:20] <Shindy7> @LiquidDinosaur Immersion

[1:29:27] <missingangle> man i hate when my floor just pisses all over itself
[1:29:29] <mathbertoldo> @sirkeigan It likely is possible to run straight there, just not with the heaviest armor and shield in the game.
[1:29:30] <@Jekado> is your place haunted?
[1:29:32] <+BoxNavy> so it pooed
[1:29:32] <$Sphincter_Spelunker> who put this dog pee on the floor

[1:30:20] <%QueequegTheater> @PeachSaliva Paige you should be beefing up your HP for big stronks
[1:30:23] <Sagebacca> either reboot steam in offline mode or create a windows firewall outbound rule blocking DS2
[1:30:23] <PanicSwytch> Just have zangief pee on your router for offline
[1:30:24] <+demon1103> @Melchior_the_Wise considering my friend was soft banned in DS3 due to an invader dropping hacked items...I have zero faith in the gaming community

[1:36:41] <CanadianAnimatorGuy> Demon of Foreskin
[1:36:42] <lotharrio> Watch his face, stay at like a... 30 degree angle from the front, do a flat out run if he jumps up or attacks from above.
[1:36:43] <%Kenzo2000> But fractions though
[1:36:44] <+ihaveautismdontbully> the area is harder than the boss
[1:36:45] <causewaybob> Frog has voice of an angel
[1:36:58] <+GuildmasterAhnonay> BAAAAARF
[1:36:59] <tanarath> You don't know how to interrupt spells, so you probably don't know when to go offensive vs. going defensive
[1:37:00] <+OmegaWeltall> well Reggie learned about another axis Kappa
[1:37:02] <Melchior_the_Wise> DS2 has some of the worst bosses tbh

[2:02:04] <cureneckbeard> Do you use the grooming wipes on Pat?
[2:02:06] <%QueequegTheater> @Mendin The DLCs can be saved for after Nashandra
[2:02:06] <lotharrio> Dog farts, are awful.
[2:02:13] <Mendin> Post-drangleic castle for the first DLC is viable
[2:02:13] <$rdark_ksu> hes such a chubby lil blorb
[2:02:17] <%QueequegTheater> Yes
[2:02:18] <corepercentlives> think it was just fat man
[2:02:21] <%TheWinged7> shrine of amana sucks
[2:02:22] <nauskills> @PeachSaliva you should get back up the elevator and take a left, there's a bit more stuff to check out
[2:02:25] <%OctaivianRex> Yeah, that's probably accurate.
[2:02:26] <+cgreene64> SeemsGood

[2:02:33] <cureneckbeard> You did it.
[2:02:34] <Finakala> @QueequegTheater I thought you needed to have the crowns before fighting Nash for Aldia to show up?
[2:02:35] <Melchior_the_Wise> Hardest part that's not the DLC
[2:02:35] <%Savages4Blood> pat, the snow section is way worse
[2:02:37] <vivaciouseff> excluding some certain DLC areas but ye
[2:02:40] <+badchoice5> Those arrows used to FUCKING HOME
[2:02:40] <%QueequegTheater> @PeachSaliva Shrine of Amana is fucking NOTORIOUS for being horseshit
[2:02:42] <Murphio_GS> Not even close
[2:02:45] <%Lion_kun> Hardest in the main game
[2:02:51] <Aydarkzero> Vase is a threat
[2:02:53] <+Aleate> No I did it :)
[2:02:57] <%Lion_kun> DLC is harder
[2:03:05] <+GuildmasterAhnonay> Huge
[2:03:06] <+TopTieramisu> the worst part of non-dlc ds2 is the path to darklurker
[2:03:09] <+badchoice5> Let's play the hottest new game "Bad Man or Vase?"
[2:03:10] <+OldDarkwraith> @PeachSaliva Ehhh Frigid Outskirts might disagree
[2:03:12] <%QueequegTheater> @Finakala Nope. Nashandra shows up after Giant Lord, Aldia after you finish his dialogues and kill Vendrick and Nashandra
[2:03:14] <Laycas49> Pat is doing the Batwing

[2:03:28] <Mendin> yet
[2:03:28] <+cdrom321> @finakala I don't see why. The DLC and Scholar are seperate things.

[2:30:01] <dabeaminator> Thanks guys! Have I missed much gameplay?
[2:30:03] <r0termond> NotLikeThis
[2:30:06] <tanarath> Mobile twitch doesn't have it.
[2:30:09] <MyNameIsRasus> it only took twitch like 8 years to add a timer
[2:30:09] <+RealThiele> some gameplay
[2:30:11] <+Sir_Gawain_Lotsson> @Admiral_PopnFresh been here for a little bit but I was about two hours late
[2:30:12] <derekwst3> hour of talking
[2:30:19] <%MetalSlimeHunt> She beat Demon of Song
[2:30:27] <Admiral_PopnFresh> @dabeaminator Shrine of Amana and Demon of Song
[2:30:31] <@SoFarFetched> well she's got quite a bit if she goes straight to DLC before she finishes main game.
[2:30:32] <+Sir_Gawain_Lotsson> gonna watch VOD for the Gief Cuddles
[2:30:48] <%MetalSlimeHunt> I can't imagine she'll actually finish the DLC on top of everything else
[2:30:49] <@SoFarFetched> or if she does DLC LUL
[2:30:51] <+RealThiele> they need a gopro for the gief crate
[2:30:52] <+Gondab> @dabeaminator She just got finished reading follows and donations.
[2:30:53] <CappuccinoGuil> Oh man, they need to add Gief to this transition LUL
[2:30:55] <Shion963> she's past Amana?
[2:30:59] <Admiral_PopnFresh> @Sir_Gawain_Lotsson oh yes, and for a nice Gief foible

[2:31:07] <+Pilzkun> this music is good
[2:31:13] <fruit_pie_the_magician> Yeah if you count the DLC she's like barely halfway through the game
[2:31:18] <penitentpentwitch> Should she even attempt Horse Valley once in the DLC?
[2:31:21] <CappuccinoGuil> @SoFarFetched DLC has FOUR women to kill, I mean, come on Kappa
[2:31:27] <@SoFarFetched> LUL
[2:31:29] <dabeaminator> I appreciate y’all
[2:31:32] <derekwst3> is the mustard green because its full of mold?
[2:31:32] <%Skelegroove> She should attempt it exactly once
[2:31:32] <@SoFarFetched> it might be tempting for her
[2:31:43] <%MetalSlimeHunt> Let alone having to deal with the final boss rush if she DOES do three crowns

[2:34:27] <heartlesshealer> the royal shield
[2:34:28] <%AncelDeLambert> holy shit she's taking so much damage without issue
[2:34:29] <CaptHat211> This is the Iron Knuckle
[2:34:32] <%AncelDeLambert> Paige you are FAT
[2:34:33] <Zombrocom> Shield should make Vel boi easy meat
[2:34:33] <sniffy77> This guy simps for vendrick
[2:34:33] <Mendin> Doctor Bong, the best villain
[2:34:35] <codycurry52> why paige
[2:34:36] <cureneckbeard> Oi it's seven bong
[2:34:37] <Finakala> This guy and Looking Glass Knight are the coolest bois
[2:34:38] <Futurecity10> The scrub filter
[2:34:38] <Srthunda> I love his armor design
[2:34:38] <chhdez> SO MEATY
[2:34:39] <dabeaminator> Velstadt isn’t super tough, she can do it in one go
[2:34:41] <MicrotonalMatt> He’s literally a darknut in the darknut arena with the pillars and everything
[2:34:42] <+RealThiele> the best kind of trades
[2:34:43] <Klefth> Ding fucking dong
[2:34:43] <+cavefishes> Hands hurting yet?
[2:34:43] <+LiquidDinosaur> Velstadt is a true bro
[2:34:45] <Aydarkzero> how will our Heroine get out of this!
[2:34:49] <+JD_Lars> Dr. Bong
[2:34:57] <%AncelDeLambert> is she gonna one try him, holy fuck
[2:34:59] <chhdez> Brute force!
[2:35:00] <heartlesshealer> all she needs is the opening to swing while keeping shield stamina
[2:35:00] <+tigerfang86> BIG slam
[2:35:10] <%MetalSlimeHunt> Pat no, don't summon crazy talk
[2:35:13] <%AncelDeLambert> THAT'S the attack that'll fuck you over, that overhead
[2:35:15] <+BoxNavy> are we sure thats not a hunting horn?
[2:35:22] <%YakumoYomi> It's a shock how much Havel's Shield trivializes a lot of these bosses
[2:35:26] <%AncelDeLambert> that's a Rath Bell, yeah
[2:35:33] <Admiral_PopnFresh> The royal Aegis....who doesn't have a shield btw
[2:35:37] <Aydarkzero> @BoxNavy it's what HH users wish they could be
[2:35:37] <+tigerfang86> RING RING RING
[2:35:38] <Zombrocom> Gold rath Hunting horn is pretty much vels hammer
[2:35:38] <vinceshamwowslap> I didn’t know that shield was that good
[2:35:39] <Aydarkzero> BIG BUFF
[2:35:40] <%QueequegTheater> @PeachSaliva I like that you can see that even as huge as he is, the bell is nearly knocking him over just to swing it
[2:35:43] <+RealThiele> LUL
[2:35:45] <+tigerfang86> HE'S JUICED
[2:35:46] <Murphio_GS> He powered up
[2:35:49] <heartlesshealer> oh no the juice

[2:35:55] <Aydarkzero> Dark Sacred Oath is so cool
[2:35:55] <+BoxNavy> oh well shit i was just kiddin i didnt think he would buff himself
[2:35:57] <mattatatatatatatat> ultra instinct
[2:35:58] <+LiquidDinosaur> @Admiral_PopnFresh He's not Velstadt who has a Royal Aegis he's Velstadt the Royal Aegis. He IS the Aegis.
[2:36:00] <%cellularmishap> Jesus imbued him with darkness
[2:36:00] <+badchoice5> DARKNESS
[2:36:02] <Murphio_GS> For the rest of the fight

[2:36:16] <Admiral_PopnFresh> @LiquidDinosaur Fair, I gues
[2:36:23] <Klefth> Velstadt could totally be just a playable character
[2:36:27] <annearkie> kind of a shit Aegis if he doesnt even have a shield tbh

[2:36:47] <FacetiousAF> monkaS
[2:36:48] <Murphio_GS> His body is the shield
[2:36:52] <+LiquidDinosaur> @Admiral_PopnFresh and remember, the only reason this game's plot happens is because this guy, and the Throne Watcher and Throne Defender are stronger than Nashandra
[2:36:53] <+Aleate> Blocking with a shield psaDogchamp

[3:03:05] <Mendin> @rosemon5001 She's here before that variant
[3:03:06] <$Piemono> Some times of dried fruit seemed designed to destroy teeth
[3:03:11] <$Solidnick18> it's the final area
[3:03:19] <SirKeigan> Wait, really?
[3:03:20] <@SoFarFetched> you can homeward bone during it
[3:03:22] <$Solidnick18> yeah
[3:03:23] <+badchoice5> THEN ANOTHER
[3:03:24] <%optimasmaximas> OOF
[3:03:24] <Finakala> And Aldia too
[3:03:24] <+Grayhammatter> yep, it's bad
[3:03:24] <%2ChickenNuggs> 2ChickenNuggs subscribed with Twitch Prime. 
[3:03:25] <SirKeigan> What happens when you beat them now?
[3:03:26] <Klefth> It's fun times
[3:03:27] <%QueequegTheater> @PeachSaliva THEY WALK IN THROUGH THE FOG DOOR
[3:03:27] <skrewarrior> but its coooooool
[3:03:27] <SirKeigan> I never did it this way
[3:03:28] <Aydarkzero> but it's so much cooler that way
[3:03:28] <$Solidnick18> that's how it works
[3:03:29] <CappuccinoGuil> @SirKeigan yup, and it's hella cool
[3:03:29] <%Sir_Gawain_Lotsson> ANOTHA ONE
[3:03:29] <rosemon5001> @Mendin ahhh
[3:03:30] <%QueequegTheater> IT'S SO HYPE
[3:03:30] <+mgskomododragon> I had that happen to me actually
[3:03:30] <DjFrostBite95> yea rooSlain
[3:03:36] <Oncamimus> @Explodincatz Im sure its some form of dark magic
[3:03:37] <penitentpentwitch> They revive each other
[3:03:37] <+RealThiele> BBC
[3:03:42] <Hydrapissed> they just swing left and right
[3:03:42] <Zooperton> are they?
[3:03:43] <DFireCreations> Once I summoned a guy and the two of us fought all the final bosses in a row, it was rad
[3:03:43] <+badchoice5> small shield dies easy
[3:03:45] <SirKeigan> Is there just no cutscene and it end?
[3:03:47] <fruit_pie_the_magician> And the the real final boss spawns in after that
[3:03:49] <+tigerfang86> She levels Dex
[3:03:49] <@SoFarFetched> Think you gotta homeward bone before the last boss shows up.
[3:03:50] <Laecerelius> big swords
[3:03:51] <+tigerfang86> that's hot
[3:03:51] <chhdez> "PAt, mustard Is a snack!"
[3:03:53] <%Lunarhawk> DS2 is known for its big guys with swords bosses
[3:03:54] <@SoFarFetched> and you can just come back later
[3:03:54] <$Solidnick18> idk the final boss is kinda meh
[3:03:55] <Murphio_GS> Wait why is paige skipping the DLC
[3:03:59] <Finakala> They can res each other, but Paige's damage is SO GODDAMN HIGH she can just power through
[3:03:59] <MrTaylorPony> kill the woman first, follow you insticts
[3:03:59] <@SoFarFetched> she's not
[3:04:00] <%RueOrin> Wait, I leave for 10 minutes and was jump to the Throne?!
[3:04:00] <chambatron> Watcher has less health tho
[3:04:00] <vivaciouseff> defender has bigger health, smacking em first helps
[3:04:01] <Vaardvark> player moveset does not mean "they have weapon"
[3:04:02] <SirKeigan> That's why hammer is so good, they all have armor
[3:04:02] <@SoFarFetched> pat's having her just do this now
[3:04:03] <JetpackMcQuack> basic bitches
[3:04:05] <Jontman42> big armor dude with the sword
[3:04:07] <Hydrapissed> why is she hitting one while locked on to the other?
[3:04:09] <+Fooguwu> does paige know she IS paige
[3:04:09] <+RealThiele> uuuuuugh
[3:04:15] <%QueequegTheater> @SoFarFetched Final boss doesn't show up until she has the thign from tall boy
[3:04:22] <+encrouched> Always a Throne Bridesmaid, never a Throne Bride
[3:04:25] <$Solidnick18> she's doing dlc after the final game i think maybe idk
[3:04:28] <Garthunox> The Watcher Greatsword is my favourite, it's like a needle
[3:04:33] <$i_am_therydon> i just found out the highlight reel guy was laid off. BibleThump
[3:04:34] <%Sir_Gawain_Lotsson> The FRAAAAMES
[3:04:36] <Mendin> She's the DEX build he's the STR build
[3:04:36] <penitentpentwitch> Paige's passive to do more damage to VVomen pays off
[3:04:36] <chambatron> she just has less helath overall
[3:04:39] <dabeaminator> Drop your shield
[3:04:41] <@SoFarFetched> @QueequegTheater well I mean if you did it where you fought these two last,you can apparently do the homeward bone.
[3:04:45] <%Lunarhawk> remember when these swords used to be good for miracle runs
[3:04:46] <ZComiX> is there any reason for paige to even move, when she can just blokc==ck?
[3:04:47] <%Lunarhawk> what a time
[3:04:49] <DrDenorax> Wait, has Paige not beaten this game before?
[3:04:53] <SirKeigan> There are NPCs that can help
[3:04:56] <Hydrapissed> paige has passive bonus damage towards women
[3:04:57] <@SoFarFetched> This is still her first run of this game
[3:04:58] <+tigerfang86> that's some BEEFY stability
[3:04:58] <Lancaster_H> Is the framerate choppy for anyone else?
[3:04:59] <%MetalSlimeHunt> Paige has only beaten Bloodborne and DS1
[3:05:00] <Garthunox> @drdenorax nope
[3:05:02] <@SoFarFetched> and probably herl ast LUL
[3:05:04] <@SoFarFetched> her last*
[3:05:05] <Mendin> @ZComiX Less blocks = less stasmina lost = more swing
[3:05:05] <theobble> Defender looks really similar to Irythil enemies
[3:05:08] <%Sir_Gawain_Lotsson> Pog

[3:09:41] <+BoxNavy> lets move on :)
[3:09:41] <$Solidnick18> yeah
[3:09:44] <theamazingroberto> 3 bosses in 2 hours of gameplay not bad
[3:09:45] <dizimous> It's a lot better than the core game
[3:09:45] <%Sir_Gawain_Lotsson> BIG AND STRONG
[3:09:45] <codycurry52> it's really difficult though
[3:09:49] <vinceshamwowslap> it’s pretty hard to
[3:09:49] <+JusTTheGuyYouNeed> And the hardest
[3:09:50] <$Sphincter_Spelunker> "We'll just bang this out real quick over the summer." Paige 2019
[3:09:51] <SirKeigan> It's about 3/4th the length of the main game
[3:09:51] <chhdez> Streeeem
[3:09:51] <+badchoice5> IVORY KING
[3:09:52] <%WingBuffet> Vendrick's music is the best shit in the game Pay
[3:09:53] <%Skelegroove> Except for a few really awful areas
[3:09:53] <%Royalguard22> STUPID Tough tho
[3:09:56] <dabeaminator> Or just do DS3 I dunno
[3:09:56] <a_mad_dragon> she has to AT LEAST do the frozen city
[3:09:56] <Klefth> It's like DS2 but good
[3:09:59] <+badchoice5> IVORY KING IS THE BIGGEST AND BADDEST
[3:10:00] <peachy996> And also Horsefuck Valley

[3:10:05] <Bigbauerboss> LUL
[3:10:05] <skrewarrior> there is one area that you definitly shouldn't do
[3:10:05] <%MetalSlimeHunt> But summer is almost over
[3:10:07] <+RealThiele> DS3 co-op
[3:10:07] <%QueequegTheater> @PeachSaliva The DLC on its own would have been a better received game than DS3 or DeS
