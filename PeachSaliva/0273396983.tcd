[0:05:44] <Breadandfaxes> FUXKIN START THE STREAM ALREADY
[0:05:46] <Keith_The_Triangle> So can we all agree that Detroit usurped this game as the best Cage game?
[0:05:48] <+Yuhstin> Did they minge it?
[0:05:49] <Too_Much_Nukie> Pat doesn't play Warframe anymore.
[0:05:50] <7thnightingale> SUP PAIGE?!
[0:05:51] <%redstonej> Pat penetrated the sex bot
[0:05:54] <TheEvilOmega> No Detroit spooilers, dickbags.
[0:06:00] <KoyaMusa> she's ordering food
[0:06:00] <Klefth> We didn't see that huge ass botch. Nuh uh.

[0:06:17] <goose_attack_almanac> No Pat, not that hole
[0:06:20] <+FrostMass22> Detroit has its problems but some plotlines can become good. I think Kara was terrible
[0:06:23] <%ssjklyco> The Zapping system in Heavy Rain is much better than RE2
[0:06:25] <ThatRandomGuy661> Did they forget what button starts the stream or did Pat fall in the toilet?
[0:06:27] <AMajorTom> mcdonalds is at the door, everybody wait

[0:06:32] <@WoolyFish> The ride never ends.

[0:40:21] <KoyaMusa> OMIKRON
[0:40:23] <+KittenHachiChan18> Polish a turd, it's still a turd!
[0:40:24] <+Wackywhitney> Accountants, man
[0:40:28] <GuillermoDelAlan> Accountants just love David Cage I guess
[0:40:30] <AstroFalcon09> Oh that guy sbfpDattebayo
[0:40:30] <MissMalisin> LUL
[0:40:31] <InsomniacPersona> It was his Taxi driver
[0:40:31] <+CerberusDriver> PLAY IN OMIKRON
[0:40:31] <Admiral_PopnFresh> Cause David wrote the story without consulting the other writers who were responsible for world building
[0:40:31] <+Antoids> It was an uber driver
[0:40:35] <blackbaron98> Accountants
[0:40:35] <ShadowZiggy> Beyond Two Souls is a mess
[0:40:36] <mrjohncarlton> Why are accountants David Cage fanboys?
[0:40:39] <devanmuse> do you have the same accountant?
[0:40:39] <YourFalloutCompanion> Cage CRAZY TALK
[0:40:40] <@MelBrooksKA> Do you have the same accountant?
[0:40:41] <bingobangoboingobongo> paige is matt in a dress confirmed! PogChamp
[0:40:41] <elementofloyalty> psycho
[0:40:42] <GMAN_SECTOR> sbfpRichard
[0:40:42] <%RaikenTB> Are accountants lizard people?
[0:40:42] <InsomniacPersona> it was his uber driver pat
[0:40:43] <Too_Much_Nukie> Accountants are David Cage's target audience I guess.
[0:40:44] <Kemmybelle> Do they have the same accountant
[0:40:45] <ha2ken> That guy must be the Nomad Soul
[0:40:51] <Polarix64> Beyond Two Souls is second worst QD game
[0:40:55] <AH_Steve17> the mainstream non ironic cage fans walk among us
[0:40:55] <+cvp5127> poor matt
[0:40:57] <MissMalisin> Acountants like zee bad games
[0:41:03] <Polarix64> Only Nomad Soul is worst
[0:41:04] <%OutlawDino> Accountant by day, Uber driver by night!
[0:41:07] <jerkhov_> detroit has a huge ad campaign
[0:41:09] <YourFalloutCompanion> Fallout 76 you fools
[0:41:10] <+FrostMass22> @admiral_popnfresh They should have just gotten those writers to write the main story, those worldbuilding things are really good
[0:41:11] <@MelBrooksKA> Is accounting not working well for him and he needed to become an Uber driver?
[0:41:12] <+Dragonfang1337> GIB DMC 5
[0:41:12] <%Solidnick18> yeee
[0:41:12] <+PenmanLupine> Decinae is VR ResidentSleeper
[0:41:12] <Wistelligence> CLOCK TOWER STREAM WHEN
[0:41:13] <admiral_of_crunch> There're anecdotes coming out from Connor's actor, where he mentions little ad libs and fun lines that are the best parts of the game, and how David Cage universally hated them and fought against their inclusion.
[0:41:13] <KoyaMusa> ITS FROMSOFT WHY?
[0:41:14] <@WoolyFish> My right toe nail has been feeling weird since Death Stranding. :C
[0:41:14] <cant_pick_a_name> can't wait to play elder scrolls VI in 10 years
[0:41:15] <SGrim> @RaikenTB well, they do all secretly work for the World Bank.

[0:41:45] <+Shaotanzhiten> I want some of that Ghost of Tsushima
[0:41:46] <elementofloyalty> What did Pat mumble
[0:41:46] <+KittenHachiChan18> The confusion kills you as you relive the memories of the game.
[0:41:46] <+Chimeraelite> Cyberpunk is going to be a trip
[0:41:47] <Polarix64> I'm most excited for Battletoad
[0:41:48] <MyNameIsRasus> Also Sekiro
[0:41:51] <Reanimator83> !uptime
[0:41:52] <@Moobot> 42m since bed time stories began.

[0:41:52] <+Wackywhitney> What about Ghost?!
[0:41:52] <%Solidnick18> sekiro is dope
[0:41:53] <%Remery_> Sekiro
[0:41:53] <demonhunter790> Maybe if we’re lucky they’ll play the game for at least 10 minutes
[0:41:54] <axelcezar> CDPRed is dope as fuck
[0:41:54] <+JoeStillLife> Metro looks awesome
[0:41:55] <jerkhov_> it looks more than okay
[0:41:59] <troxcree> Since tehy stopped being Fire Emblem.
[0:42:00] <GuillermoDelAlan> I just want to play Death Stranding. At this point I'm just tired of the weird ambiguous gameplay
[0:42:00] <CastellanVon> Paige plays Fire Emblem?
[0:42:00] <+KittenHachiChan18> I legit freaked the fuck out when I saw the Battletoads
[0:42:01] <$Agami23> the characters have feet!
[0:42:01] <+Antoids> the UI and transitions in the new fire emblem are very impressive from a technical standpoint
[0:42:03] <LiquidMathew> the whole delivery boy thing kinda killed all my interest for death stranding, its just so odd
[0:42:04] <%Meidolaon> It's fine, Fates was a dumpster fire

[0:42:08] <+patriotrenegade> @PeachSaliva We've actually got a decent grasp of what is happening in Death Stranding via the trailers
[0:42:09] <+Gouf_Troop> echoes was godd
[0:42:09] <GuillermoDelAlan> Last of Us 2
[0:42:10] <SwindlerOfProgress> I'm cautiously optimistic about FE.
[0:42:10] <admiral_of_crunch> Paige is fucked
[0:42:12] <ThePuddingDead> Everything Devolved Digital announced, I'm super down for, they have a great track record for good games
[0:42:14] <ArgentUndaCova> D:
[0:42:16] <%Doctor_Death_Bed> @PeachSaliva What about the Not Armored Core Game?
[0:42:16] <jerkhov_> sekiro isn't a souls game
[0:42:18] <radda343> but what about the further adventures of garbage?
[0:42:18] <AstroFalcon09> I’m hype for spiderman cause i wanna swing like a spiderman
[0:42:19] <AH_Steve17> get good the game
[0:42:20] <ArgentUndaCova> Paige can't get huge D:
[0:42:21] <Gameslayer2> That makes me interested
[0:42:21] <$GohanEgret> the REAL dark souls starts now
[0:42:21] <Polarix64> Which is great
[0:42:22] <%RaikenTB> Interesting.
[0:42:23] <ElementalX1000> Stop ignoring SoV you cowards
[0:42:24] <+Shaotanzhiten> Yeeeah, he said no class system or progression really
[0:42:24] <+KittenHachiChan18> Dude. METAL WOLF CHAOS
[0:42:24] <Marz452> oh shit Pat got his hurr did... lookin good guy
[0:42:24] <blackbaron98> wow

[0:42:27] <+Wackywhitney> Thanks to Activision, I assume?
[0:42:27] <Kemmybelle> But does it have fashion?
[0:42:27] <%OutlawDino> From makes a 1st person VR game and it isn't King's Field. What the fuck??
[0:42:28] <JDRK> that actually sounds sick tbh
[0:42:28] <Klefth> It's Tenchu :D
[0:42:28] <Spydurman> woaw
[0:42:28] <%magicalhades> hype for METAL WOLF CHAOS
[0:42:29] <+Shaotanzhiten> I'm not super happy about that
[0:42:29] <DaHaLoJeDi> Who hyped for Cyberpunk 2077
[0:42:30] <%Meidolaon> Fire Emblem: Three Houses looks dope tho
[0:42:30] <+FrostMass22> For better and for worse, David Cage basically is quantic dream
[0:42:31] <troxcree> So Paige isn't gonna be beating it any time soon I guess.
[0:42:31] <@Moobot> Do you have a Fanfiction for Paige to read? Submit it to us here and it may get read on stream! http://bit.ly/2jsxJo9

[0:42:58] <@Moobot> 43m 7s since bed time stories began.
[0:42:59] <+MisterTylerrr> Death Stranding seems to make sense to me. Somewhat. There was an apocalypse, The Reedus has to gather resources from the vast, barren-ish landscape while having to occasionally dodge weird invisible guys who can be detected by babies.
[0:43:00] <%Solidnick18> cool
[0:43:01] <+Antoids> let us jones

[1:20:37] <$joylent_blue> michelangelostark no, paige is yelling at delivery man
[1:20:38] <+OceanGovernor> Hopefully the delivery boy's blood will sate her

[1:20:41] <Gameslayer2> Are we stuck on a loop
[1:20:42] <%Picabunny> beep beep
[1:20:45] <%FaultyJawa> Pat is going to his safe cake place in the closet so he doesn't get secondhand immasculation
[1:20:46] <%Keyd00d> I hope somebody gets fired for that
[1:20:49] <%umbypokochan> @AstroFalcon09 thanks! i'm so sick of it now tho lol
[1:20:51] <+Dingus_Tickler> If the delivery driver is a pregnant woman then OOF
[1:20:52] <MyNameIsRasus> BEEP BEEP
[1:20:55] <yosukecchi> looking forward to the delivery person spitting in the food and paige suing him for it
[1:20:56] <+BarkerStreams> I wonder if Paige is being dimplomatic ir taking a massive mustard shit down that delivery guys throat
[1:20:58] <mercado94> Delivery guy: Paige, you were too late...
[1:20:59] <michelangelostark> @joylent_blue thank you thank you
[1:20:59] <Hawkbone_> People joining in the middle of this must be so confused right now.
[1:21:02] <%PonyHearts> We have all become trapped in the Elmo zone, there is no escape.
[1:21:02] <%redstonej> I hope the delivery guy is not pregnant
[1:21:05] <cant_pick_a_name> imagine being locked in a room with this song playing nonstop
[1:21:05] <SirTheThird> My stream froze. What happened?
[1:21:06] <zoloyen> MIAO
[1:21:07] <+shawntk_> so what exactly did the delivery person do
[1:21:08] <Senselessvirus> I think Paige ran across town and murdered that VVcdonalds driver after getting a taste for it by pressing R1.
[1:21:10] <silverback129> we're getting two r1s tonight
[1:21:11] <+OceanGovernor> Double Kill!

[1:21:38] <blackbaron98> paige is eating the driver right now
[1:21:39] <Hawkbone_> *but nobody came
[1:21:41] <+NightOwlSam> @Dingus_Tickler it's super effective
[1:21:41] <%Picabunny> @waltzqueen Pat didn't answer the delivery guy's calls, so he 'discarded the order' (read: is eating Paige's food) and moved onto other orders. Paige is currently on the phone with said delivery guy.
[1:21:42] <$joylent_blue> he might also be eating paige's food
[1:21:44] <+AncelDeLambert> The food delivery guy pulled a Fedex

[1:58:17] <+pleasenameyourcharacter> @peachsaliva speaking of McDonald's, due to the wonders of genetics, all through high school i could eat 2 burger with fries and not gain a pound. Not anymore, though. I've moved on to real food.
[1:58:18] <$joylent_blue> where's the burger murder button in the report menu
[1:58:18] <+VoltKing> she needs to be in an asylum for that

[1:58:24] <DavidSanChan> McDonald's Meat Cylinders

[1:58:28] <YourFalloutCompanion> "Don't get high on your own supply"
[1:58:28] <Noctantis> dcan you not order it without the bun at Mc?
[1:58:29] <+ThatGuyfromMars> soggy is great, crispy is great, browned is great too
[1:58:30] <sparrrow_> if you ask them for fries without salt you can force them to make them fresh, then just ask for a pack of salt to add yourself
[1:58:31] <elementofloyalty> And Pat ruins that Doc

[2:11:28] <LiquidMathew> DmC is lowest with 2.7 million
[2:11:28] <%bloodypurpledog> But its the Best DmC game Kappa
[2:11:30] <$GohanEgret> its not bad, its disappointing

[2:11:51] <@corn_on_fire> is he talking about that dmc reboot?
[2:11:51] <TheImmortal70> It's not bad gameplay wise, it's just that it absolutely ruined DMC's whole essense
[2:11:51] <SwiftFission> is it worse than chaos legion?
[2:11:51] <Spydurman> elequence incarnte
[2:11:52] <DracaenaLeaf> DmC is more fun than DMC 2
[2:11:52] <+Tenchi_G> Resident Evil 6 bad

[2:11:58] <troxcree> I'm so ready for DMCV featuring Demi-Fiend from the Shin Megami Tensei series.
[2:11:59] <admiral_of_crunch> A friend of mine played DMC2 just a couple weeks ago. He was absolutely fascinated by how terrible it was.
[2:12:00] <$lewisferret> DMC is really bad
[2:12:01] <+Caidezes> DMC2 needs to be erased from history.

[2:12:15] <reonome> huh pat is right
[2:12:19] <+Walopoh> Journalists made fun of the old fans for being angry and for them to vote with their wallets, then the game sold poorly so the journalists called the fans immature lol

[2:12:38] <NYCrownlessKing> "Capcom stated that the sales of the original game were "solid" but noted that the game did not catch Eastern gamers' attention and made less than its previous iteration, Devil May Cry 4." @PeachSaliva

[2:15:54] <admiral_of_crunch> HEY, SO A COOL THING IN DMC2, and I doubt any of you really know except the crazies, but Dante has a special Devil Trigger that only triggers when he has a pixel of health left. He grows twice the size, grows wings, flies around, and has a completely unique moveset with chestlasers and crap. It lasts for maybe 8 seconds.

[2:36:11] <+jkobe34> why did this motel room come with drugs?
[2:36:12] <johnthecoolmex> is it legal to have painkillers in a motel room?

[2:36:18] <Fathuran> @PeachSaliva Ummmmmmmm do you really wanna trust motel medicine cabinets?
[2:36:19] <+krawtch> whereas she CAN sleep in motels because the likelyhood of a rapey scenario is more likely

[3:10:33] <%PatNTheHat> @PeachSaliva "I'll be honest, I like Heavy Rain." -Pat, at the start of the LP on the channel
[3:10:34] <JamvaanPS4> Mileage is based on how much Eurojank you can handle.
[3:10:35] <$KaiserRolled> Also keep in mind even if it reveiwed highly, people reviewed these fucking cage games highly
[3:10:36] <+future_ry> it's a 6/10
[3:10:37] <+OmegaFatalis> it's like ghetto Deus Ex and Bloodborne
[3:10:40] <Itsandrewbaby> would you have relations with an android?
[3:10:40] <+SolidusRex> Play VTMB instead you coward.

[3:10:52] <benswanny> Omikron 9/10

[3:19:17] <%KendallLitDinner> sipsipHellmo sipsipHellmo
[3:19:17] <+Ropcord> how did the guy even fit in there
[3:19:18] <%SaltyDongs> Pat is an expert

[3:19:27] <@Moobot> Do you have a Fanfiction for Paige to read? Submit it to us here and it may get read on stream! http://bit.ly/2jsxJo9
[3:19:28] <leinadtonu> Paige kmnows glass, guys
[3:19:30] <elementofloyalty> shoot the glass
[3:19:31] <+AXL808> You know I think putting Paige in a normal tunnel is enough to stop her
[3:19:31] <+krawtch> oh thats why you cant sweep the glass aside
[3:19:32] <Rezroc> You gotta imagine how dumb this must have looked setting all this up
[3:19:33] <%SSaryn> sipsipElmo sipsipElmo sipsipElmo sipsipElmo sipsipElmo sipsipElmo
[3:19:35] <$mister___doctor> This is the visual representation of watching Super Best Friends Play
[3:19:36] <+NightOwlSam> Glass him
[3:19:36] <Zeikier> extra EXTRA sharp!
[3:19:40] <+krawtch> its ghost glass.
[3:19:42] <AstroFalcon09> Of course it is no physics with cage
[3:19:43] <+griffball13> @PeachSaliva Good thing Paige isn't there she would have eaten it all by now.
[3:19:49] <+KittenHachiChan18> You MUST be joking
[3:19:49] <+Drivershaft> now I know what a third world TV dinner feels like
[3:19:49] <elementofloyalty> Elmo
[3:19:50] <%TheGershon> I never understand having things float because of clipping. Just make them touch the ground?
[3:19:51] <Darren716> Holy shit i just realized something about this trap but it's a spoiler, how did the killer physically set this?
[3:19:56] <+NightOwlSam> LUL
[3:20:04] <+KittenHachiChan18> Elmo and his fluffy tail is distracting me from this garbage
[3:20:07] <elementofloyalty> I love him
[3:20:11] <alwayspronking> WHO SET THIS UP
[3:20:13] <Dragon_Batman> @Darren716 Sshhhhhhhhh
[3:20:13] <ArgentUndaCova> Elmo save us D:
[3:20:13] <$Kage_96> @Darren716 Doesnt matter who he is Questioning how anybody could do it is the problem lol
[3:20:14] <johnthecoolmex> so, why is this in a power plant?
[3:20:14] <%RaikenTB> Wouldn't it actually be the direction opposite of where the flame is blowing?
[3:20:14] <%EdHeng> INTENSE MUSIC
[3:20:14] <%papasatansanglouie> Soooo... how exactly did the origami killer get all this glass in here?
[3:20:15] <%SSaryn> @PeachSaliva I should mention you're actually really fucking yourself up hard by going this fast.
[3:20:15] <PessimisticOptimism> Killer used the boys
[3:20:17] <+AXL808> the killer had the glass sharpened before using it in the tunnel
[3:20:17] <Damashi_The_Kaotic> Is this section timed?
[3:20:18] <$RubberFistFight> ok this dumb asshole would have bled to death by now if Cage games where even remotely connected to reality.
[3:20:18] <+CluelessSniper> This part is so dumb
[3:20:20] <+cvp5127> shhhhhhhh
[3:20:21] <+ThatGuyfromMars> @Darren716 don't worry about it
[3:20:22] <Reanimator83> Bloodborne
[3:20:22] <Zaphire_Saucypants> @Darren716 paid someone to do it?
[3:20:24] <Jolly_Adventurer> @Darren716 No shut up its fine
[3:20:25] <$RubberFistFight> like, sharp glass is no fucken joke.
[3:20:27] <+DeadlyToastY> its charged glass
[3:20:32] <Ace_Kuper> @Darren716 Is this the first time you watch SBFP play this? It gets brought up all the time.
[3:20:33] <+Solutha> @Darren716 well he pays that car mechanic guy
[3:20:33] <%zenwebley> Almost at the trial
[3:20:34] <Chimera_Caim> You're going too fast, you need to slow down when crawling
[3:20:38] <+AncelDeLambert> question not the Cage
[3:20:39] <Hawkbone_> So, theoretically, if the person who set this up was fat, then wouldn't it be impossible for them to actually make this trap?
[3:20:42] <$RubberFistFight> ULTRA INSTINCT GLASS
[3:20:44] <EclecticDemon> M A G I C
[3:20:44] <+KittenHachiChan18> I honestly thought this was an oven like the ones in holocaust camps
[3:20:44] <Mechazoic_Era> that is SO much glass! it's like a factory FOR broken glass D:
[3:20:44] <elementofloyalty> Pat the bag
[3:20:45] <$Kage_96> By the first turn he would have died
[3:20:48] <$RubberFistFight> it's fast and it fucks you up
[3:20:51] <ha2ken> To right...to the left...take it back now y'all...
[3:20:51] <%SaltyDongs> Take it back now y'''all
[3:20:54] <+ThatGuyfromMars> @Hawkbone_ stahp, you're saying too much
[3:20:56] <+NightOwlSam> one of the other father's
[3:20:57] <Darren716> Ace_Kuper Nah I've seen the lp and the stream, just never connected it
[3:20:58] <$mandragoraroot> WutFace
[3:21:02] <StooEsq> this is the worst Physical Challenge ever
[3:21:02] <+CluelessSniper> And no one brushed away the glass
[3:21:06] <+pleasenameyourcharacter> it's really fortunate that Ethan has a shitnton of matches.
[3:21:06] <elementofloyalty> why music
[3:21:08] <Polarix64> @Darren716 Seriously it makes no sense, especially because of the killer's size
[3:21:10] <dalishprince> woah that was intense
[3:21:10] <+CaptainJax> he's a very economically minded serial murderer
[3:21:11] <alwayspronking> Blood everywhere
[3:21:14] <+NightOwlSam> LUL
[3:21:15] <+pleasenameyourcharacter> *shit-ton
[3:21:17] <+KittenHachiChan18> It's a leather jacket, dude. Glass doesn't cut thorugh good leather that easily
[3:21:18] <$mister___doctor> This is really fuckin' sadistic. I bet the Oragami Killer is watching this on camera somewhere Jerking off
[3:21:20] <+DeadlyToastY> what if the previous guy had like hepatitis c or hiv or something
[3:21:21] <$Agami23> reusing assets, what is the oragami kliller, a quantic dream employee??
[3:21:21] <EclecticDemon> HYPE MUSIC OVER

[3:21:22] <PessimisticOptimism> Triangle is a hold
[3:21:24] <%edited156> Just lie on the floor forever

[3:22:27] <+CluelessSniper> What is the point of that slide?
[3:22:29] <$the_sprankton> how many kWH do you think this "abandoned" substation uses every day? Somebody from the power company should probably look into that.
[3:22:29] <@Moobot> We're accepting fanfiction submissions, if you think you have a good one message a mod today!
[3:22:29] <%Keyd00d> NICE
[3:22:30] <Hawkbone_> @PeachSaliva The smart thing to say would be "leave it to the police to save elmo, as they are likely far more competent I would be"
[3:22:32] <jiin6> Stop the elmo abuse
[3:22:36] <Doctadaking> How the FUCK does the killer have enough money to sustain all this power? It's fucking absurd.

[3:50:19] <%pixelmike> LIVES IN THE ASTRAL CLOCKTOWER
[3:50:19] <Zaphire_Saucypants> what the fuck kind of Rapist Office is this?
[3:50:21] <RichAnvils> THE LIVING PLANET
[3:50:21] <$KaiserRolled> Pat is correct
[3:50:24] <StooEsq> big EGO sign, this must be David Cage's office
[3:50:24] <Damashi_The_Kaotic> Her snitching doesn't even make sense, because the Origami killer was killing kids while Ethan was in a coma
[3:50:25] <Doctadaking> This scene is so dumb and unbelievable
[3:50:27] <LiquidMathew> Jayden literally just said that
[3:50:28] <$CrowbarFacelift> Put that degree to use Pat
[3:50:34] <Polarix64> God Ethan's wife is the worst
[3:50:34] <alwayspronking> time to R1 him
[3:50:34] <+pleasenameyourcharacter> i went to therapy for most of high school. this is bullshit in so many ways.
[3:50:38] <%Keyd00d> R1
[3:50:42] <$the_sprankton> "I'm bound by an oath of secrecy." That's the sort of thing that a psychiatrist with a giant poster saying "ego" would say.
[3:50:44] <elementofloyalty> Yes
[3:50:53] <%zenwebley> R1
[3:50:58] <Liwyn> you mast tell us dactah
[3:50:58] <Doctadaking> How is this guy licensed
[3:50:58] <elementofloyalty> Flip the table
[3:50:59] <badmr7> this looks a room from indigo prophecy
[3:50:59] <Polarix64> God fucking damn it Blake
[3:51:00] <$KaiserRolled> Move shrink, just nudge his chair
[3:51:03] <+krawtch> im going to tell on you
[3:51:05] <%LifesNeverHumDrum> we are the police
[3:51:05] <Zaphire_Saucypants> "Find salvation of your mental demons through the LORD" says Woolie's Mom.
[3:51:07] <+FloorBurger> call the police on the police
[3:51:10] <$KaiserRolled> R1
[3:51:11] <Polarix64> Fucking Blake
[3:51:11] <AstroFalcon09> We are the police
[3:51:12] <Zola390> Wow, NONE of this matters.
[3:51:12] <%KendallLitDinner> R1

[3:51:21] <%SSaryn> R1
[3:51:22] <Liwyn> did Paige do the woolie?
[3:51:22] <%redstonej> This is how you get your case thrown out of court
[3:51:23] <blakeway> R1
[3:51:24] <LiquidMathew> Ethan being in a coma is a pretty good alibi for not being the killer, and yet the game seems to forget
[3:51:24] <%zenwebley> These scenes are so poorly done
[3:51:24] <Arclight2879> egg him on
[3:51:27] <%MrBorisMakarov> R1
[3:51:32] <Mr_Strut> ANGERY
[3:51:34] <elementofloyalty> Oops
[3:51:35] <@WoolyFish> Sex shrink on the desk.

[3:51:47] <reonome> blake is the worst
[3:51:50] <ThePuddingDead> thats a good question
[3:51:52] <$KaiserRolled> Literally all the evidence you'd get from this would be UNUSABLE
[3:51:56] <+pleasenameyourcharacter> how was Blake not fired for this kind of behavior? how'd he even make detective? did he become this awful AFTER he made detective?
[3:51:56] <Zaphire_Saucypants> this is Trump's America. David Cage is a soothsayer!
[3:51:58] <Doctadaking> This is so stupid...
[3:52:01] <Polarix64> Oh my god Blake this is the worst
[3:52:02] <+FloorBurger> Save thin Pat
[3:52:05] <%svensationalism> so the best part about this is anything the shrink would tell them at this point is 100% not admissable in court of law because of coercison

[3:53:13] <$rdark_ksu> seriously your FBI you can basically blow this small town shit who cares
[3:53:14] <SubliminaIMessages> Jason should've been the killer. I really wanted to kid a child
[3:53:15] <+krawtch> now that you've stopped beating me, i will tell you everything
[3:53:17] <ThePuddingDead> if I was in the fbi's shoes, i'd immediately pin blake against the wall and make him stop

[3:55:18] <@WoolyFish> "Would you care to schlorp a few balls with me?"
[3:55:19] <%Aztec50> is this an INDOOR driving range?
[3:55:32] <ThePuddingDead> i tried golf i really did, i had more fun in the golf cart than trying to hit it
[3:55:35] <$rdark_ksu> honestly a golf club is a pretty shitty weapon
[3:55:38] <ShimmerFairy> Man, Elmo's such a good cat.
[3:55:39] <RichAnvils> its a Top Golf

[3:55:54] <corepool> R1
[3:55:55] <+krawtch> this would be cooler if instead of a driving range it was a batting cage, and instead of playing as Sam Douglas you played as Kiryu
[3:55:56] <agadejobi> Paige should read Agony in Pink!
[3:55:57] <bamboosprout> people hit with irons at a driving range too, you know?
[3:55:58] <+FloorBurger> Use a bat.
[3:55:58] <%RonDewing> you gotta pratice with all of the clubs
[3:55:58] <+LazyRabb1t> what does that mean pat?
[3:55:58] <ha2ken> Look. The lady next to them is Ethan's ex-wife.
[3:55:59] <AstroFalcon09> The irony sbfpShido
[3:55:59] <Arclight2879> Golf is the aether

[3:56:06] <+BarkerStreams> pat you can tee with whatever you want
[3:56:06] <Zaphire_Saucypants> why would he even bring an iron to a driving range in the first place, specially on that small?
[3:56:08] <Hawkbone_> Why id Kramer even bring an iron?
[3:56:09] <yosukecchi> golf is awful
[3:56:16] <elementofloyalty> Paige was a Classy Woman?
[3:56:18] <LiquidMathew> lmao

[3:56:32] <strickersdickers> you can hit a fucking iron at a driving range how else would you practice
[3:56:33] <+NightOwlSam> R1 this guy with the club
[3:56:36] <+pleasenameyourcharacter> i played golf once. once. i spent about 60% of the course asleep in the cart.
[3:56:36] <RichAnvils> you use all your clubs so you can gauge how far you can hit each club
[3:56:37] <benswanny> People practice irons all the time idiot
[3:56:39] <elementofloyalty> Iron Range
[3:56:46] <cgmerryo> pat big dumb

[3:56:48] <+Ropcord> ask him questions with a golf club
[3:56:49] <benswanny> They're more fun that drivers sometimes
[3:56:55] <+MechaBaphomet> Because you practice with different clubs
[3:56:56] <+Blargimazombie> You can practice with all your clubs
[3:56:57] <Zola390> Kramer? COSMO KRAMER?!?
[3:56:59] <$rdark_ksu> Pat you hit all your clubs at the range, its to improve your swing and get better range with all your clubs.
[3:56:59] <Stewbedale> Its for testing any of your club shots pat
[3:57:00] <+Blargimazombie> Learn ranges
[3:57:03] <%zenwebley> This would be better if they were playing Jai Lai. Or bowling, and Shelby gets a chicken.
[3:57:05] <elementofloyalty> Pat plays Golf with Single Driver
[3:57:06] <+FrostMass22> He already brought his driver, he brought his bodyguard too
[3:57:06] <+AncelDeLambert> The range is netted, nothing's even hitting the windows
[3:57:10] <benswanny> Driver isn't the only club in golf pat
[3:57:15] <%Aztec50> ohhh
[3:57:15] <$MajorCrasher> to be fair people who don't play golf wouldn't kno the difference between clubs
[3:57:16] <+krawtch> no its not.
[3:57:16] <Doctadaking> Shoot Kramer with the golf club
[3:57:20] <benswanny> maybe with an 9 iron
[3:57:21] <+Bricespresso> pat: expert at sports confermed LUL

[3:57:39] <+pleasenameyourcharacter> "Would you care to play some Mahjong, Mr. Shelby?"
[3:57:40] <%LifesNeverHumDrum> he did not kill kids - he did naaaaaat
[3:57:41] <cgmerryo> pat big big dumb
[3:57:43] <benswanny> Pat knows golf bc shutup

[4:11:12] <Doctadaking> The message just reads "Lol get fukt"
[4:11:15] <benswanny> Bad to ze bad game
[4:11:18] <alwayspronking> theme of ze bad game
[4:11:22] <+Antoids> "i once slammed my pinky into a door, and thats basically the same as this"
[4:11:24] <AstroFalcon09> U mom gay
[4:11:24] <elementofloyalty> It looks cool
[4:11:24] <Liwyn> Press X to sadness
[4:11:26] <%ssjklyco> Again, his son would be dead in a day
[4:11:27] <yosukecchi> now he needs to be taken care of again
[4:11:29] <ExpendableComicRelief> is this ze bad game?
[4:11:30] <$KaiserRolled> And that was the one good scene
[4:11:35] <%Keyd00d> Paige has been through worse
[4:11:37] <+krawtch> so at this point its ridiculous that he a) doesnt search addresses sequentially or b) tell the cops where to search
[4:11:37] <elementofloyalty> Pat knows
[4:11:37] <Junkles> how many roosevelt streets can there be?
[4:11:38] <%arcadeking48> Oh yeah, this would fuck you up
[4:11:43] <$KaiserRolled> Paige that would hurt like fucking shit
[4:11:48] <$Agami23> why not just do that magic trick where you fake taking off a finger?
[4:11:50] <%SSaryn> GOLD FINGER
[4:11:52] <%SSaryn> I FORGOT
[4:11:53] <SociallyAwkwardToaster> Tell Paige the plot hole
[4:11:53] <Dragon_Batman> How did they lose it?
[4:11:56] <+NightOwlSam> haha that trophy
[4:11:56] <%arcadeking48> Especially given what Ethan has been through both physically and psychologically
[4:11:57] <elementofloyalty> the penis does not?
[4:11:57] <ExpendableComicRelief> my mom lost the tip of her ring finger and she didnt go into shock, thankfully
[4:11:57] <+griffball13> Don't your toes?
[4:11:58] <DavidSanChan> hack off the glans
[4:11:59] <lethallunacyx> I would way rather drive the wrong way through traffic
[4:11:59] <Doctadaking> Theres like 3 Roosevelt streets
[4:12:00] <agadejobi> Shit, losing your whole fingernail is bad enough
[4:12:04] <@Moobot> YOU'RE BEING TOO LOUD! (blakeway) (warning)
[4:12:05] <Sielas> super wrong
[4:12:06] <@MelBrooksKA> The "eh" feeling is called shock
[4:12:07] <benswanny> Pat knows golf really well too
[4:12:08] <+Jaysky> Don't tell her the plot hole till the end
[4:12:10] <%ssjklyco> What was the plot hole
[4:12:11] <elementofloyalty> The testiclesdo not?
[4:12:11] <$RubberFistFight> @PeachSaliva you don't go into hypovolemic shock (from blood loss) but you do go into a state of pain induced emotional shock and it suuuucks.
[4:12:13] <MoulesFritz> @PeachSaliva that's why we orgasm with our hands
[4:12:17] <$nitronLVIII> Where the Kaz quotes in chat?
[4:12:19] <+TheMattman1313> @PeachSaliva Ok so now he knows the street and the first 3 digits in the address, so that's like what, a city block of searching?
[4:12:22] <%LifesNeverHumDrum> he should have chopped off a foot, they could just reuse the limp animation
[4:12:23] <Meme_Platinum> @DavidSanChan cut your glans off on stream Kappa
[4:12:23] <Kemmybelle> your gremlin child better appreciate what you're doing for him.
[4:12:24] <elementofloyalty> :O :D
[4:12:26] <CurrySauseBandit> @PeachSaliva Was it the tip or the tip from the knuckle? There's a different amount of pain there.
[4:12:27] <+krawtch> if that scene was to cut off the tip of your dick, i have a feeling Shaun would need to grow gills
[4:12:30] <ExpendableComicRelief> i wish i had hair to cut :(
[4:12:31] <Polarix64> Oh yeah this scene which is hilarious is choose to not cut off your finger
[4:12:32] <Ell1ot> and you expect Pat to get a haircut?
[4:12:34] <+NightOwlSam> how did madison find him
[4:12:35] <elementofloyalty> Elmo

[4:12:58] <LiquidMathew> Ethan was also in a goddamn Coma during the first killings
[4:13:00] <mtgtin> Through the car and rain?
[4:13:00] <elementofloyalty> @PeachSaliva is doing better than Pat.

[4:14:11] <firmlygraspi1> why do people like this
[4:14:11] <+Blargimazombie> Do it doosimoan
[4:14:11] <+krawtch> if you dont cut the finger off, a cop shoots Ethan in the shoulder so that he still has to rely on Madison to carry him
[4:14:11] <Hawkbone_> Those boards are NOT that heavy.
[4:14:12] <benswanny> Ethan your severed finger is HOT and I am female. Let's BANG
[4:14:12] <blakeway> remember how if you don't cut your finger off in the last scene, a cop SHOOTS it off in this one?

[4:20:29] <reonome> BANG HIM
[4:20:29] <LiquidMathew> Ethan getting shot depends on how many trials you've fail/completed, Pinky is lost if you've failed all them, Shot in hand (no finger loss) if you've done 1, Shoulder if 2 complete, not shot if you've done all 3
[4:20:30] <Zola390> BONE-ZONE!!!

[4:26:28] <Hawkbone_> I don't think this scene is in VR

[4:26:34] <+LogothX> Terminator vr glasses
[4:26:34] <leinadtonu> Aura gummy
[4:26:34] <AirlineFood74> Did I miss the Supermarket chase?
[4:26:36] <filialpails> the rei ayanami killer
[4:26:36] <+krawtch> it absolutely is
[4:26:44] <AstroFalcon09> Yes
[4:26:44] <+b_koj> Gorlami Killer
[4:26:45] <Jolly_Adventurer> @AirlineFood74 yeah
[4:26:45] <$nitronLVIII> DONT DO ALL THE DRUGS
[4:26:47] <+NightOwlSam> i'd like to believe this dude was a previous owner of ARI
[4:26:47] <elementofloyalty> is that voice familiar?
[4:26:50] <leinadtonu> Puss?
[4:26:50] <AirlineFood74> dang
[4:26:51] <@WoolyFish> Why does the helpful AI man call it "you know what"?
[4:26:54] <+krawtch> hes not talking about drugs either
[4:26:56] <admiralsatan> john cena is the aragamer killer
[4:26:57] <@WoolyFish> Just say what it is...
[4:26:57] <+DrunkenDice> take it easy on...you know what
[4:26:59] <Mr_Strut> Don't do future crack, kids
[4:27:04] <Junkles> it's ambiguous
[4:27:05] <%zenwebley> The Argiculture killer
[4:27:06] <ExpendableComicRelief> that red ice, man
[4:27:07] <%Picabunny> @WoolyFish Because you're supposed to think he's referring to the drug.
[4:27:11] <Liwyn> do the red ice
[4:27:13] <totalyaniceguy> Is it Porn?
[4:27:13] <admiralsatan> its a metaphor
[4:27:14] <AstroFalcon09> @airlinefood74 they didn’t miss up the chicken part
[4:27:14] <Huntercd> Why can't he do normal drugs instead?
[4:27:15] <+G_Thunders> The Red Ice
[4:27:15] <Doctadaking> This technology is so out of place and tonally disconnected
[4:27:17] <+krawtch> its absolutely the glasses
[4:27:18] <sosuke5> EAT. THE GLASS
[4:27:18] <Hawkbone_> There is nothing here to suggest that this scene is in VR other than Nahman wearing the glasses
[4:27:19] <+cerberuscarmine> dont take that super bad killer drug that will kill you *wink*
[4:27:19] <energywarning> too much screen time will kill you
[4:27:20] <+pleasenameyourcharacter> @ssjklyco i guess VR piano and Blake yelling at passersby is more important than the investigation and suspects THEY SAW IN PERSON.
[4:27:21] <ThatDangSkeleton> It's Red Ice
[4:27:22] <%Picabunny> But he's so obviously referring to the glasses.
[4:27:23] <Zaphire_Saucypants> but the ARI...there's so much...so much porn. So much VR Hitomi booby pr0n.
[4:27:24] <Ace_Kuper> @PeachSaliva I only thought about it now, there is he getting the sound from, glasses?
[4:27:25] <elementofloyalty> Is the Butler Peter Stormare?
[4:27:25] <Zola390> QUIT ASKING QUESTIONS WOMAN
[4:27:29] <DracaenaLeaf> Welcome to mars
[4:27:30] <+yet_another_brony> but hes a vr man, he keeps no secrets
[4:27:31] <%redstonej> he's referring to anime

[4:27:36] <PessimisticOptimism> “Map”
[4:27:38] <ShadeTheNovice> Dodging that like a boss
[4:27:38] <+olliedelosa> Meanwhile, on Mars
[4:27:39] <%LifesNeverHumDrum> he sounded so much like stormaire
[4:27:41] <ThatDangSkeleton> He's referring to jerking it
[4:27:42] <%rustyarmor> god i fucking hate these damn glasses
[4:27:42] <%KendallLitDinner> MOUNTAIN
[4:27:42] <+SailingSaturn> Its always Anime cirBaka

[4:27:59] <DraxTD> @admiralsatan cause a character name is Eithan MARS XD
[4:28:00] <+krawtch> too much anime is a one-way road to obesity, pedophilia and tumblr
[4:28:01] <%LifesNeverHumDrum> p close tho
[4:28:01] <AstroFalcon09> This is a lie wheres the big fat anime tiddies
[4:28:05] <admiralsatan> OH BABY

[4:28:14] <elementofloyalty> Canibisda
[4:28:15] <Hawkbone_> Go to VRchat
[4:28:16] <Chimera_Caim> What if the VR scenario is based on his own imagination and the butler just represents his inner thoughts

[4:28:41] <AirlineFood74> TO THE PLAGUE
[4:28:42] <Hawkbone_> @Chimera_Caim How would the glasses be able to do that without being connected to his brain?
[4:28:42] <PessimisticOptimism> John Denver wasn’t from West Virginia
[4:28:43] <%LifesNeverHumDrum> that's also the wrong kind of Forest for the Pacific Northwest, we're mostly coniferous
[4:28:43] <%SausageShogunate> sipsipElmo sipsipElmo sipsipElmo
[4:28:44] <filialpails> almost heaven, western canada
[4:28:48] <+SailingSaturn> The sound effects are cool
[4:28:51] <elementofloyalty> Strippers in Canada
[4:28:52] <Chimera_Caim> So he would know what the butler means while it leaves the player questioning the meaning

[4:41:26] <Hawkbone_> It might also be a self fulfilling stereotype, where lesbians just accepted it as a means to pick each other out. @PeachSaliva
[4:41:27] <Voytek> so Paige dosen't hate other women, she's just tsundere
[4:41:28] <dalishprince> don't be like woolie and run away
