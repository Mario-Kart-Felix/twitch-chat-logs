[0:25:21] <reyntime180> Hmmm, screaming cat or snoring dog? This is a tough choice
[0:25:24] <cache_22> I think the audio bitrate is a bit funky for the game audio.
[0:25:27] <+LittleCinders> I'm watching both streams and I think I'm phasing in and out of reality
[0:25:29] <+krispen_wa> DO COMBO
[0:25:29] <Ozavic> Twitch is doing a fucky wucky
[0:25:34] <reyntime180> Im more of a dog person tbh
