[0:05:07] <Daisuke89> HOpe the stream is not too long, but if so can only watch about 2-2:30 hours, going back to work finally tomorrow :)
[0:05:11] <%oda_flobunaga> Taking all bets, Paige first tries Smelter...
[0:05:11] <+Shubreaker> not to sound contrarian but this is my 2nd fave ds
[0:05:16] <%tizz86> @jemeralddragoon enjoy good fellow
[0:05:18] <+LonePlus_> got a wild ear infection
[0:05:20] <+Archphronimos> @Melchior_the_Wise I'm wondering if it might take a whole stream to get through Smelter....
[0:05:24] <+LonePlus_> probably gonna lead to another burst
[0:05:25] <+LonePlus_> pain
[0:05:28] <+Shubreaker> with demon's being the first
[0:05:33] <%jemeralddragoon> \o/

[0:07:36] <skyentombment> May call her Peach
[0:07:39] <skyentombment> SOME
[0:07:40] <+Scevda> Honestly I feel they are kind of dated. The downside of reference filled intros, the references fall off and new ones replace thme.
[0:07:46] <%oda_flobunaga> Will Smelter go the way of Embriatus? Find out Now!1!!!!!1111!
[0:07:47] <skyentombment> may call her Paige

[0:30:19] <%Bane_Kaikyo> He hands you a sparkly thing that you then print out into the real world. It is still unreadable in the state, so you must then roll up the paper and insert it into a usb drive. Then the computer will ask to instal a unique translater program. After a short instal period it will consume the paper and convert it into a text file. This text file simply reads "GIT GUD'
[0:30:21] <+Sebenoth> if only she had some way of SHIELDing herself from arrows

[0:44:03] <SpaceGuntank> you can freeze them or toast them. its more unusual to just eat them plain as is.
[0:44:03] <%Keyd00d> DOODOO
[0:44:03] <+RedMaskBandit> Poptarts are calzones
[0:44:04] <weissguard> As long as it's not any of the strawberry ones, we're good.

[0:49:20] <armchairmaster_> I'm going to end this discussion easily: if you PREFER non-frosted over frosted you are an animal.
[0:49:23] <$Hylian726> japanese mayo is different apparently

[0:49:23] <%spiritofmojave> I gag when I smell white people food like egg salad or sourkraut blech

[0:50:15] <%radiocrawler> Mayo and tuna fish. You can’t do better. Hard boiled eggs and bread and butter slices and you’re dope.
[0:50:15] <Laironx3> LUL
[0:50:15] <%SMuffinMan> LUL
[0:50:16] <+OdysseyKnight> Nothing personnel kid
[0:50:16] <@Jekado> thats not so fine
[0:50:16] <+shinydemonguy> knock knock!
[0:50:18] <%purplehermit12> if youdidnt roll

[0:50:18] <+b1gboss007> psaDab psaDab
[0:50:18] <%RafflesiaA> That roll LITERALLY killed you
[0:50:19] <%SvenHolgersson> hhahahaahhaha
[0:50:20] <%purplehermit12> you would have made it
[0:50:20] <%arsentuf> Paige out here playing DS1
[0:50:20] <wrightlight94> zentreKEK
[0:50:21] <cosmicgoatee> LUL
[0:50:21] <$DesertPenguin> THIS IS THE ONLY GAME THAT YOU'RE INVINCIBLE FOR THAT
[0:50:21] <ScreamLord> You would have made it if you didn't roll
[0:50:22] <%tizz86> Western mayonnaise uses egg white. Japanese uses egg yolk
[0:50:22] <%twistedj3ster> tbf I forgot that too
[0:50:22] <%oda_flobunaga> yep
[0:50:23] <%sharpington_> you roll slower than you jog
[0:50:24] <%Lion_kun> I'm so happy ds3 made you invincible
[0:50:25] <+trustycoyote> DS2 changed that @PeachSaliva
[0:50:25] <DXLelouch24> Yea if you want to die HARD
[0:50:27] <+Big_Hudson> so why is the camera just elmo?
[0:50:33] <Jrocy247> Japanese McDonalds is way different from American McDonalds....They actually care about making food
[0:50:33] <+demon1103> DS2, no invicibility doors here!!!!
[0:50:36] <jobbedbone> why is everyone in here so passionate about food?
[0:50:36] <+linSP> ds2 is the only one the ONLY one
[0:50:37] <%VritraReiRei> Japanese Mayo is GODLIKE. It's more like an Egg Salad in a Tube. Can just eat it with only bread or rice. WAY different than any other Mayo @PeachSaliva
[0:50:39] <$DesertPenguin> It means you can't boss rush in DS2 which sucks
[0:50:40] <%SMuffinMan> Only game where that happens
[0:50:40] <%ssjklyco> Just roll with it
[0:50:41] <lotharrio> Paige specs harder and harder into a non-roll build, and thus she starts rolling more.
[0:50:41] <+Sebenoth> @PeachSaliva this boss is part of lucatiels quest
[0:50:43] <codycurry52> Maybe Super heavy armor and giant shield is overkill?
[0:50:43] <@SoFarFetched> But that's how you roll Paige.
[0:50:45] <2fcd_twitch> No I-Frames, because fuck you
[0:50:46] <+RealThiele> oh lawd she comin
[0:50:53] <ScreamLord> THEN WHY ARE YOU FAT!?
[0:50:54] <$TIME_PUNCHER> Miracle Whip > Kewpie Mayo > Normal Mayo
[0:50:56] <@PlagueOfGripes> Paige will roll into her grave. Because she was kicked
[0:50:56] <%radiocrawler> Oh fat rolls. Nice.
[0:50:57] <%optimasmaximas> LUL
[0:51:00] <%thejimjamz> SHE WANTS TO GO FAST
[0:51:00] <+ALazo> Havel the rolling stone
[0:51:03] <wantedsafe471> maybe you should buy/use some poison arrows
[0:51:03] <%baronblank> roll when fat, block when no shield
[0:51:04] <skyentombment> Slowrolling in front of an enemy so even they get confused and think "wtf are you doing?"
[0:51:04] <@SoFarFetched> "They see me rolling,THEY HATING" - PeachSaliva
[0:51:06] <%baronblank> the paige way
[0:51:06] <CalderGaming> so, expect you to live?
[0:51:07] <olaksi> In constant rebellion against herself
[0:51:10] <DXLelouch24> Boss is gonna break that ass even more
[0:51:11] <%ShichiNoBushi> Spec the un-specced.
[0:51:14] <FirearmsInstructor> OMG WHY IS ELMO HAVING A STARING CONTEST WITH ME LUL XD
[0:51:14] <$Hylian726> she CRAVES to play as suboptimally as possible. it's the ONLY way

[0:51:18] <%ssjklyco> Paige is on a roll in this area.
[0:51:21] <cureneckbeard> cardcaptors of the clow expect the unexpected now
[0:51:26] <ScreamLord> Their armor is dope
[0:51:28] <$TIME_PUNCHER> Alexa, play Rollin' by Limp Bizkit
[0:51:28] <%j0ustar> Paige only wants the FATTEST roll Pat. She needs it
[0:51:29] <EuropanLamprey> Paige rolls with Havels, attacks with the Tower Shield, Estus's infront of enemies and doesn't life gem when alone
[0:51:29] <%SMuffinMan> LUL
[0:51:32] <Mehless> we will beat this game in 2022

[0:52:03] <the_sword_of_dusk> Paige is either going to first time smelter or we will be see this run for four hours
[0:52:04] <owensleftfoot> the fact that people actually defend this part baffles me
[0:52:04] <DXLelouch24> FF7R part 2 will be out by the time Paige beats DS2
[0:52:05] <Ashenik1> IS this modded verion?
[0:52:07] <FirearmsInstructor> @SoFarFetched D:<
[0:52:08] <Zombrocom> Eventually everyone will despawn and this run will be easy

[0:55:22] <%spiritofmojave> not a bad first try!!
[0:55:22] <%AncelDeLambert> it's better if she DOESN'T notice th echip, it'll fuck her mind up
[0:55:23] <+Archphronimos> that's a great first attempt
[0:55:23] <%SvenHolgersson> MORTIS
[0:55:23] <owensleftfoot> but they do reduced damage

[0:55:27] <%purplehermit12> Paige has to summon lucatiel
[0:55:28] <+patriotrenegade> Pat, wheres the fun in that?
[0:55:28] <Jetsfantasy> Does she have a higher flame resist shield for this fight specifically?
[0:55:29] <Mehless> good first try!
[0:55:29] <+calzonewithextracheese> i used to farm this boss...let's just say, this boss is bad and poorly designed
[0:55:29] <%Th3SmartAlec> He blew Woolie
[0:55:31] <$Hylian726> but it doesn't do much damage at all while buffing
[0:55:32] <Zombrocom> If she hits him during the phases shifts she will crush him easy
[0:55:33] <2fcd_twitch> Estus seems way faster
[0:55:34] <Mehless> it blew woolie
[0:55:34] <the_vainglory> It was pretty sad, really.
[0:55:35] <%RafflesiaA> Maybe switch your lifegems for better ones
[0:55:36] <%Keyd00d> Woolie btfo
[0:55:36] <+Sebenoth> @PeachSaliva lucatiel can be called outside fog
[0:55:37] <+luckypineapple> Smelter is a pretty tough boss early on
[0:55:38] <%Sir_Gawain_Lotsson> yeah Woolie forgot how to drop his shield
[0:55:40] <CalderGaming> @PeachSaliva LUCATIEL THO
[0:55:46] <+logoth_> doesnt havel armor also have a lot of fire resist
[0:55:46] <$Solidnick18> pretty much
[0:55:49] <@Jekado> big stronk
[0:55:50] <MemnonV> use fire extinguisher
[0:55:50] <$Hylian726> DS2 quests DansGame
[0:55:52] <HyperionXV> You're also using a shield with like 80% fire resist
[0:55:52] <Orenjevel> just run
[0:55:54] <lotharrio> It aint easy being greasy.
[0:55:54] <%oda_flobunaga> @PatStaresAt Well she's better than either Woolie or you so...
[0:55:57] <%Promessa_EX> it's heavy and takes blood from your brain
[0:55:57] <Shade075> @Th3SmartAlec For an entire day no less
[0:55:57] <iamnolionheart> Big PP spec OP
[0:55:58] <+calzonewithextracheese> yes havel armor has massive fire resist
[0:55:58] <%Trenr> it aint easy bein greasy
[0:55:59] <Mehless> it aint easy big peepy
[0:56:00] <+Sebenoth> biggest havel peepee
[0:56:00] <$NitronStreams> git gud past woolie
[0:56:03] <%Sir_Gawain_Lotsson> truth
[0:56:06] <+Archphronimos> could wear a fire resist ring if you're "optimizing" fire resist
[0:56:06] <gluttonousmimic> Biggest PP.
[0:56:08] <@Jekado> even roll resist
[0:56:08] <+RealThiele> getting laid resist 100
[0:56:08] <owensleftfoot> @calzonewithextracheese are you for real? this the best base game boss in the game lol
[0:56:15] <Jetsfantasy> Ah, okay. It's been awhile since I played DS2
[0:56:16] <+blademaster247> Havel Armor block eyesight tho
[0:56:17] <Orenjevel> thanks armor
[0:56:19] <BeefyQueefer> But it's lacking in Sundown Resistance
[0:56:19] <%starotter70> Paige's dick is so big it wraps around her leg
[0:56:20] <+Archphronimos> not sure using a ring for that is worth it though
[0:56:22] <$Hylian726> stamina regen resist?
[0:56:24] <Orenjevel> weeb sword

[0:57:31] <%Sir_Gawain_Lotsson> Great quote
[0:57:32] <%arsentuf> sipsipHellmo
[0:57:33] <+OdysseyKnight> Just ram into them until every enemy despawns and you'll be the biggest
[0:57:34] <Mehless> look both ways before crossing the street
[0:57:35] <$Hylian726> Neo_Kaiser they ruined the flow, but the game would be absurd if they straight up removed them. it was designed to be played with gems
[0:57:36] <Zeemod155> Looking at Paige in the facecam, she looks more focussed and determined than ever!
[0:57:36] <$NitronStreams> She dont care how She wants it now
[0:57:39] <+Sebenoth> Lucatiel wont make it 'much easier', but worth it for her questline
[0:57:40] <EuropanLamprey> Paige has the heaviest armor therefor she must go fast
[0:57:42] <%ssjklyco> Enemies are despawning now
[0:57:45] <+NWR_James> @withguac shes feeling 'ugly" today
[0:57:49] <+blademaster247> Why can't they just put the bonfire in the boss room so I can respawn there?

[0:57:52] <CalderGaming> SUMMON LUCATIEL @PeachSaliva
[0:57:53] <@Jekado> honestly in this area i pussyed it out and just despawned them
[0:57:54] <+vaporousTippler> It's my beating, and I want it now!
[0:57:54] <wantedsafe471> iron keep=anor londo
[0:57:54] <withguac> Where are their faces

[0:58:07] <@Jekado> the snailsouls life for me
[0:58:12] <+demon1103> Me: so how big are the aggro zones in Iron Keep? Iron Keep: Yes
[0:58:14] <Jrocy247> yyyyyup
[0:58:18] <DXLelouch24> No wonder Paige broke her ass,she constantly wants it fucked
[0:58:18] <@SoFarFetched> Yeah That's what I did.
[0:58:19] <%AlphaTauri> yea I despawned these guys on purpose
[0:58:19] <Jolly_Adventurer> These guys are fucks
[0:58:20] <lotharrio> I mean that would be my tactic, honestly.
[0:58:20] <Jetsfantasy> I did
[0:58:22] <@Jekado> good place to grind too
[0:58:24] <+Archphronimos> I did
[0:58:24] <+calzonewithextracheese> more and more of this reminds me the 'good' bosses are ion the dlc
[0:58:25] <BeefyQueefer> No forget that feel bad
[0:58:25] <%purplehermit12> if you join the covenant of champions dont they respawn?

[0:58:27] <@Jekado> and they are managable
[0:58:28] <DXLelouch24> sipsipGasm
[0:58:28] <WhitePantherZ> its great for soul farming
[0:58:29] <Mehless> this is where i discovered the despawning
[0:58:29] <+Sebenoth> yeah, despawn on purpose and hey.. soul farming too
[0:58:29] <+RealThiele> no cheese in souls just good tactics
[0:58:31] <+FackinCrazy> Honestly its a great farming spot for souls
[0:58:32] <%Keyd00d> How many times do they have to die again?
[0:58:35] <+luckypineapple> this is one of the worst boss runs in the game
[0:58:35] <Orenjevel> cool song
[0:58:37] <TurtlesAndTentacles> What is it with paige and the clown music
[0:58:37] <iamnolionheart> Did SOTFS make despawning enemies easier? It seems like it's taking less runs than I remember
[0:58:38] <%Sir_Gawain_Lotsson> I just blocked enemies so that I would get to the boss without taking damage
[0:58:38] <@SoFarFetched> Dab for despawn sipsipDab
[0:58:39] <%bluescreen1988> i want to see the baby too :(
[0:58:45] <WhitePantherZ> @Keyd00d i think its around 15

[0:58:46] <@Jekado> the problem is they all agrro really fast which i think is a bug

[1:08:09] <sosuke5> shrine of amana though
[1:08:10] <lotharrio> I spent like a day trying to clear this area out over time.

[1:08:32] <jobbedbone> the prowlers
[1:08:33] <$DesertPenguin> A BOW TRIVIALIZES THIS AREA
[1:08:34] <%radiocrawler> Inevitable. This area sucks balls now.
[1:08:34] <%baronblank> literally don't do horsefuck valley
[1:08:34] <derap41> Aloone will also fuck you
[1:08:34] <%AlphaTauri> shrine is super nerfed in scholar, Alonne for sure
[1:08:36] <DedlokPM> @ittla it used to be easy to snipe them to get them aggroed 1 by 1, but now it seems they increased the aggro range for SOTFS

[1:08:55] <+luckypineapple> Alonne is the worst by far, because you have a time limit.

[1:09:10] <+HelveticaScenario> I'm late to the party. Why no cam?
[1:09:11] <+AlphaBankai> Nah, Alonne you can actually get fucking past the enemies if you wait for the salamander to shoot

[1:23:15] <@Calek> you also get a sick ring after
[1:23:15] <%g0atmeal> She has no idea how much pain it is to dodge this boss' hitboxes
[1:23:16] <%superc37> YES YOU DO. YOU NEED TO SUMMON LUCATIEL HERE
[1:23:17] <+AlphaBankai> She isn't even going to use the NPC gear guys
[1:23:18] <%Tucker0603> lucatiel is needed, as she is best girl
[1:23:19] <%RafflesiaA> If you tell her about the damage aura she'll just go even slower and die even more

[1:23:26] <raveous> you know as much as dark souls 2 grinds me gears I must say that Lucatiel is one of the coolest named NPCs in the soul series

[1:23:29] <+logoth_> ar-roww

[1:23:57] <$Hylian726> SoFarFetched I just find it's not worth ruining the boss fights by summoning
[1:23:58] <derap41> Paige needs a button to lower the shield not raise it shield needs to be permamently raised
[1:24:02] <Willfordbrimly> Whu happuh face cam?
[1:24:10] <%Keyd00d> That guy's gonna run in here if she beats him
[1:24:14] <@SoFarFetched> @Sebenoth no they did two,Flexile and the rotton.

[1:24:26] <Jrocy247> 7
[1:24:27] <EuropanLamprey> The only difference in Lucitiels quest if you summon her is she gives you her stuff, you still get all the dialogue so it's not necessary for Paige
[1:24:29] <CaptHat211> HEAL
[1:24:29] <DXLelouch24> No wonder Paige broke her ass, took too many arrows too it
[1:24:30] <@PlagueOfGripes> so did they just give up on lucatiel

[1:24:34] <+bread_assassin> @Willfordbrimly By Paige's admission, she looks like shit today.
[1:24:35] <%rumtumtugnutz> @Willfordbrimly Paige thinks she looks gross so there's no facecam. Instead we get Elmobag

[1:24:40] <@SoFarFetched> @Hylian726 I mean if you're playing it multiple times I can see doing it later. But if its like you're only going to play the game once,might as well see the NPC stuff.

[1:52:26] <+tigerfang86> RAISE YOUR SHIELD
[1:52:28] <$Agami23> ESTUS
[1:52:29] <BurlyBeef> 43str, 4 int
[1:52:30] <%StevenTheUnicorn> chugg
[1:52:31] <%purplehermit12> IF YOUHAD MORE HEALTH YOU COULD DO THIS
[1:52:32] <+NWR_James> Press X to LIFE GEM
[1:52:33] <%StreamStopA> Does Peach even have resin or humanity?
[1:52:34] <%purplehermit12> lytNOTIKETHIS
[1:52:35] <%Zulrez> @DandyMackeroos yes, unless you want to do an npc quest
[1:52:36] <%AncelDeLambert> @PeachSaliva Paige, the gems are for BETWEEN rounds, not during. Estus after he starts swinging
[1:52:37] <+BioStormX> Unequip the life gems
[1:52:38] <themagic_conch> summon lucatiel!
[1:52:38] <cosmicgoatee> YOU KEEP LIFE GEMMING
[1:52:38] <Owlboy7> NO ESTUS RUN LUL
[1:52:38] <%g0atmeal> Use items as soon as you're done blocking
[1:52:39] <$Dutchpotato> She’ll run out of life gems eventually 4Head
[1:52:46] <%StevenTheUnicorn> NO ESTUS RUN
[1:52:48] <+Molly_McAlister> Life Gems have a longer animation.
[1:52:49] <%RafflesiaA> Get the ring anyway
[1:52:50] <%purplehermit12> When she runs out of life gems she'd do better lol
[1:52:52] <%robobeau> Stop using life gems in this flight
[1:52:53] <cosmicgoatee> NO YOU DONT
[1:52:53] <%xmetalicdemonx> WHAT!!!
[1:52:57] <%encrouched> NO PROGRESS RUN
[1:52:57] <%Th3SmartAlec> ...
[1:53:01] <%Keyd00d> estus is not finite
[1:53:03] <%Keyd00d> yeah
[1:53:04] <%radiocrawler> Estus is good boss healing
[1:53:06] <Crimpson> Plus the dmg of his fire aura is canceling out the life gem heal
[1:53:06] <+Jasek7> try using your eyes
[1:53:07] <%Zulrez> life gems for trash, estus for boss
[1:53:09] <Mystgate> Smegma Demon: the tester of friendships
[1:53:09] <eco419> :)
[1:53:11] <+Sebenoth> lifegems are also good to keep moving too
[1:53:11] <wantedsafe471> paige, leave the life gems in the box. so you dont use them
[1:53:11] <$Hylian726> she's saving her infinite estus
[1:53:12] <%Keyd00d> PAIGE
[1:53:12] <%Th3SmartAlec> BUT BABA
[1:53:13] <VirtuaRailith> I made a comic.
[1:53:13] <%worldbrand> the fire ring would probably help because it's damage she has to take
[1:53:13] <@PlagueOfGripes> life gems are also great in battles with damage over time, but... I mean. Come on.
[1:53:14] <cosmicgoatee> @encrouched man I love walking into dooooors
[1:53:15] <$Hylian726> FOR LATER
[1:53:15] <EuropanLamprey> Pat, make Paige buy the Smelter Helmet after this and make her play the rest of the game as an anus face
[1:53:16] <DandyMackeroos> @zulrez And she doesn’t seem to be doing the quest I think
[1:53:17] <freelancebabymaker> she has 7 life gems left
[1:53:21] <%radiocrawler> Your estus drinks are great
[1:53:22] <+BioStormX> You're in a boss, thats the whole reason you try to save your estus throughout the level. For the boss
[1:53:23] <Scrummo> that fire ring wouldn't hurt. itd give you longer between healing
[1:53:23] <$Dotta5> come on
[1:53:23] <%Th3SmartAlec> LUL
[1:53:23] <DracaenaLeaf> brain go hrrrrrr
[1:53:24] <+consistentlylistless> estus is bestus
[1:53:25] <+AlphaBankai> You told her the opposite of that at the start of the game Pat
[1:53:26] <GarbageQueenEllie> Tbh, calling your kid a "Miracle Child" is a recipe for disaster. You'd think after 12 kids he'd learn good parenting
[1:53:27] <eco419> But baba
[1:53:28] <%starotter70> OH YEAH
[1:53:29] <%Keyd00d> oh shit
[1:53:29] <%spiritofmojave> yesssssss
[1:53:29] <+AlphaBankai> You taught her wrong tbh
[1:53:30] <%g0atmeal> Lifegems let you move, but that doesn't help if you're blocking everything
[1:53:31] <mrblack499> life gem is back up

[1:54:32] <%RafflesiaA> Paige taught herself wrong as a joke
[1:54:34] <%starotter70> paige: "I'm bleeding, making me the victor"
[1:54:36] <%purplehermit12> the extra health would help
[1:54:37] <%j0ustar> Paige ultimate strat: empty the area first so you can SPEED

[2:02:09] <+Sebenoth> paige must gets eyes on the inside
[2:02:16] <%Th3SmartAlec> @alex_id Paige dying. In the game as well.
[2:02:16] <DandyMackeroos> Time delt with the smelt

[2:02:20] <dreu81> @segychan yes
[2:02:21] <capnqwark> Thanks for reminding me I still haven't gotten around to finishing Bloodborne in a world where FUCKING PAIGE has.
[2:02:24] <%RafflesiaA> @alex_id Iron Keep sucks, we got the fire ring
[2:02:27] <%StevenTheUnicorn> avoid his fire honks
[2:02:31] <%realm_forge> Cos never delt it after smelting it
[2:02:31] <%Keyd00d> still a lot of fire damage
[2:02:32] <Zaphire_Saucypants> is this the run?
[2:02:33] <+SickBangerzM9> orphan aint got nothing against the hardest enemy in dark souls 2. TRACKING
[2:02:34] <%oda_flobunaga> MELT THAT SMELTER
[2:02:34] <DXLelouch24> I wonder if theyll top Orphan of Kos in Elden Ring

[2:02:53] <+SickBangerzM9> DROP YOUR FUCKING SHIELD PAIGE
[2:02:58] <Zaphire_Saucypants> this is not the run.
[2:03:00] <Mehless> if smelter's defence didnt go up this would be a nice boss

[2:05:30] <derap41> Dark Souls 2 was made with summoning in mind its the best Coop Dark souls
[2:05:33] <+DappercatEsquire> I summoned every boss when I played, fuck it, made the game more fun for me
[2:05:33] <Scrummo> 1v1 ing the boss is for nerds
[2:05:33] <+Sebenoth> also summons up the HP
[2:05:34] <%Blank9> npc is balanced
[2:05:34] <+necrocannibal2> I NEVER SUMMON
[2:05:38] <%SvenHolgersson> I mean its just CHEATING but w/e gosh
[2:05:39] <DandyMackeroos> It’s part of the game after all
[2:05:40] <%radiocrawler> She has the combo down.
[2:05:42] <+SickBangerzM9> npcs die in like 5 seconds anyway and leave you with a buffed boss most of the time
[2:05:44] <+necrocannibal2> IM A BIG MAN
[2:05:45] <%SMuffinMan> ARE YOU READY TO DEALT
[2:05:47] <Oxybe> Delter him Paige!
[2:05:49] <@PlagueOfGripes> bears knowing: doing the whole game with other people is how the japanese community plays these games. so most bosses are designed with that in mind

[2:18:49] <$Niney_Who> Just like the opposite of Papyrus, Blue means Move
[2:18:52] <$DesertPenguin> Pat, try telling her to go left and see wha happun
[2:18:53] <$Hylian726> @peachsaliva remember to mash triggers to take less damage from grabs
[2:18:54] <+xenoriddley36> "How could this happen to me?!" intesifies
[2:18:58] <DandyMackeroos> @steventheunicorn And then he penetrates you and injects his curse fluids directly into you
[2:18:58] <+dmtjinni> YEYEYEYEYE
[2:18:59] <+Sebenoth> but what if paige uses shield in right, and hammer in left, for the match u

[2:28:47] <+ArkhamBenji> Elmo ban is perma ban
[2:28:52] <BeefyQueefer> Elmo sent me a DM calling me a "Ballbag"

[2:28:58] <DandyMackeroos> Maybe the Iron keep is on one of those floating islands that bad guys usually populate
[2:28:59] <+dmtjinni> so cheasy LUL
[2:28:59] <Zombrocom> On the mountain behind the windmill, hellscape is pretty weird though*
[2:29:00] <+Sebenoth> <Message deleted by Elmo>
[2:29:02] <+Archphronimos> The lore of Iron Keep being that it sank into the lava because it was so heavy seems to indicate that Iron Keep should be one of the LOWEST levels in the game
[2:29:02] <Rangenade> holy shit this animation cancelling swordsmen
[2:29:03] <+necrocannibal2> damn
[2:29:07] <+logoth_> Look at all the little pats

[2:29:08] <+dmtjinni> wow
[2:29:09] <@Jekado> I keep telling you pat its the same elevators like in RE that transport you to the lab... always?
[2:29:14] <+Prism_Wing> Man, I've been spoiled by modern skyboxes.
[2:29:15] <benjiFG> interesting how the ds1 greatsword resembled guts' golden age sword while the ds2 and ds3 greatsword resembles the dragonslayer
[2:29:17] <$Hylian726> make sure to wait to heal until the enemies can hit you
[2:29:25] <+logoth_> Why are they so black again?
[2:29:26] <+necrocannibal2> stop killing the Pats
[2:29:28] <MetalSlimeHunt> Elmo has sent me the Navy SEAL copypasta on twitter literally every day for the past five years please help

[2:29:32] <%chiazamformerlymankeyfigh> god the on-hit soounds in this game are garbage
[2:29:36] <EuropanLamprey> BEST SPELL IN THE GAME
[2:29:38] <BurlyBeef> you can't just ask why they're black
[2:29:39] <DatAsuna> @benjiFG not as much as the demon's souls dragon bone smasher
[2:29:40] <MetalSlimeHunt> They won't ban him, they say he owns them
[2:29:41] <l33tc4k3> no helping you, accept your fate
[2:29:45] <+dmtjinni> insert Woolie joke
[2:29:45] <karovus> this is preparing her to face the real pat
[2:29:46] <Valentinius_Anodyne> @Archphronimos I think this got said last stream, but literally everything would be fixed if the elevator to this zone just went down
[2:29:47] <%superc37> @quigsies not rly, since des, ds1, ds3, and bb all had fantastic level design with geography that made sense and didnt use impossible space as crutch.
[2:29:53] <%SvenHolgersson> How about a RUDE hat in the style of GET SMOKED
[2:29:57] <%SMuffinMan> So I'm pretty drunk
[2:30:00] <+SpicyCheeseNips> Why is there Elmo face cam and what's wrong with the audio?
[2:30:05] <EuropanLamprey> It's down the hall
[2:30:06] <%SMuffinMan> I'll say it

[2:30:27] <+SpicyCheeseNips> It's all garbled for me, I guess I should just refresh
[2:30:27] <%SMuffinMan> THIS GAME SUCKS DICK
[2:30:28] <@SoFarFetched> nothings wrong with the audio on my side
[2:30:29] <BeefyQueefer> Paige is a LITTLE quiet
[2:30:36] <+Prism_Wing> You can't just ask why they're black without your N Pass Premium.
[2:30:37] <+Taisuru> @SMuffinMan Preach

[2:31:23] <%SMuffinMan> Never playing it again
[2:31:25] <wsintai> no stop
[2:31:28] <%SvenHolgersson> FULL HAVEL IS ALWAYS BEST
[2:31:28] <Quigsies> @superc37 Yeah, I agree that it's a neat thing when the map makes physical sense, but I don't think that this game's use of impossible space is a big deal compared to a lot of the real issues in this game
[2:31:31] <%radiocrawler> Oh we going full Havel? Damn
[2:31:32] <+MeMillionthDollar> Oh god Dragontales!
[2:31:34] <+Archphronimos> but "GOOD JOB SWORD 2.0" is so catchy...
[2:31:34] <Coystick> What have I missed WOW we've barely moved
[2:31:34] <EuropanLamprey> They're fixed in Ds3
[2:31:34] <Broand> is that elmo from the first game
[2:31:35] <Zombrocom> That's the greatsword, not the Ultra Greatsword
[2:31:40] <%superc37> also it looks way different from the first game
[2:31:42] <%SvenHolgersson> The story behind Dragontales is so precious
[2:31:46] <+SpicyCheeseNips> Pat and the Giant Peach.
[2:31:48] <Cryomancer_Maurice> It's better with the fire damage.
[2:31:48] <%oda_flobunaga> GET THOSE ROCKS ON
[2:31:49] <Finakala> BKUGS is still pretty damn strong though
[2:31:50] <%SvenHolgersson> It makes me happy

[2:32:02] <eco419> big stronk
[2:32:02] <%ShichiNoBushi> Where's James with this Giant Peach?

[2:34:06] <+Archphronimos> DS2 is widely considered "the worst Souls game", but it's still a great game imho
[2:34:07] <%alex_id> New build
[2:34:09] <%j0ustar> of course Pig likes Pig shield
[2:34:10] <%SMuffinMan> @Nips it's bad and I'm drunk
[2:34:13] <qu3kl41n_the_impure_king> and 16 Dex, BUT DONT TELL ANYONE YOU LEVELED THAT SHIT UP
[2:34:15] <DandyMackeroos> Dark Souls 2 isn’t bad
[2:34:16] <@SoFarFetched> Everyone agrees and disagrees on a build.
[2:34:22] <ammobasket> Furtive pig (me)
[2:34:27] <derap41> God I hate how Havels stone armor is shining
[2:34:28] <%SMuffinMan> Fuckin
[2:34:32] <$Hylian726> SpicyCheeseNips people drastically overreact because it's the worst souls game, but it's still a great game on it's own
[2:34:33] <+SpicyCheeseNips> DS3 is the worst game tho. Without Cinders anyway
[2:34:34] <+Sebenoth> yeah, DS2 has some of the best build variety IMO, and better movement than DS1
[2:34:40] <%SMuffinMan> Run to Smelter
[2:34:40] <+Archphronimos> @derap41 RIGHT?
[2:34:42] <ionfamous> this rock armor reflects light so well
[2:34:42] <$bbHighvalor> DS2 is the fucking best Soulsborne
[2:34:44] <cosmicgoatee> i feel like in one ear out the other is the theme of this
[2:34:47] <%Blank9> DS3's the most fun to play of the three
[2:34:48] <Cryomancer_Maurice> DS2 is a great game, but if you put it up against the others it loses. The issue that no one likes talking about, DS2 has the best pvp, but no one plays for PVP.
[2:34:49] <DatAsuna> Yeah DS3 is too obsessed with fanservice for my taste
[2:34:51] <%StreamStopA> Let's fuck on those rocks!
[2:34:52] <Hydrapissed> upgrade shield
[2:34:54] <%SMuffinMan> Stupid windmill
[2:34:56] <%AlphaTauri> Cinder really made DS3 feel right for me
[2:34:59] <DatAsuna> DS2 also has fanservice but it's at least easier to ignore
[2:35:01] <Cryomancer_Maurice> DS3 is the tryhard.
[2:35:05] <%SaphronBlackbourne> DS2 is garbage, 1 > 3 >>>>>>>> 2
[2:35:06] <2fcd_twitch> Ds2 isn't bad, i just hate playing it
[2:35:11] <%crimsonberry255> DS2 should've never been a 'souls'. Shoulda made it something else.
[2:35:11] <+necrocannibal2> the movement in DS2 makes me want to kill myself
[2:35:11] <EyeFarted> TRY 2 HAND TOOTH WITH NO SHIELD
[2:35:12] <%SMuffinMan> Discount Quelaag
[2:35:12] <%radiocrawler> I adore DS3 Cinders mod.
[2:35:16] <@SoFarFetched> If not there's still the other hammer.
[2:35:18] <+necrocannibal2> it's like my character is underwater
[2:35:20] <Coystick> Elmo is LONELY
[2:35:24] <+logoth_> Paaaaaat
[2:35:26] <%j0ustar> Paige.
[2:35:26] <%SMuffinMan> Fuckin
[2:35:27] <%Jack_of_No_Trades> non negotiable
[2:35:27] <%tuesti> what do you guys mean by fanservice?
[2:35:29] <ionfamous> noo shield upgrade
[2:35:30] <+Sebenoth> by movement i mean 8 way rolling vs ds1
[2:35:30] <Buttsoup_Barnes> yea, elmo
[2:35:31] <Zombrocom> Man, I made a power stance quality build that used the Fume Straight Sword and the Abyss Greatsword, it was so sick I loved it
[2:35:35] <%SMuffinMan> DS sucks
[2:35:35] <EuropanLamprey> Oh God, the "which Dark Souls game is the worst" flame war has returned
[2:35:37] <%oda_flobunaga> DS2 should have been a licensed MLP game
[2:35:38] <xxshadowxx416> just take a sex break
[2:35:47] <%walternatorz> will she remember?
[2:35:49] <+trustycoyote> If she doesn't complain her complain gland may get blocked up @PeachSaliva
[2:35:49] <+Archphronimos> DS2 feels slightly different than the others, but it did a lot of things quite well
[2:35:50] <%SMuffinMan> DS2 sucks*
[2:35:54] <+sonofrobin73> DS2 IS BAEST GAEM
[2:35:55] <%StreamStopA> she learned
[2:35:56] <$Hylian726> tuesti everybody complained when DS2 wasn't connected to 1. Then they connected 3 and people complained almost as hard LUL
[2:35:57] <%spiritofmojave> @europanlamprey it never left LUL
[2:36:01] <%walternatorz> she remembered!
[2:36:02] <cosmicgoatee> LUL
[2:36:12] <+Archphronimos> would have been so much better if they kept the original lighting mechanics....
[2:36:12] <DatAsuna> If DS2 was just called "dragon souls" people wwould like it more
[2:36:13] <%j0ustar> I wouldn't be able to handle my own Paige. I just can't.
[2:36:19] <+Jaysky> DS3 actually feels like a sequel yet people call it fanservice
[2:36:20] <%tuesti> @Hylian726 u kno what, im not surprised
[2:36:28] <%ElenaManetta> is the complaint gland like roger from american dad's negative bile that builds up over time if he's not snarky
[2:36:34] <%RafflesiaA> WOW
[2:36:35] <Neo_Kaiser> If Pat wants a refund for Doom Eternal he should make a manual request.

[2:36:46] <@SoFarFetched> LUL nice
[2:36:48] <+SpicyCheeseNips> I really hope she falls it would be FUNNY
[2:36:50] <+NWR_James> Big ate it
[2:36:50] <+Sebenoth> she did not in fact see it
[2:36:56] <DatAsuna> Because it's the worst kind of sequel, one that spends it's story just jerking off the past

[2:39:53] <$Hylian726> NeroInfinite I agree, muffin bottoms are severely underrated if it's a good muffin. sometimes they can be overcooked and dry though
[2:40:00] <%AncelDeLambert> there's people who only eat the tops of muffins? What the hell are they, Martians?
[2:40:06] <+Sebenoth> dry muffin bottoms are the pits

[3:06:48] <%rumtumtugnutz> Hot? Hans? No way dude
[3:06:50] <DatAsuna> like cloud of darkness
[3:06:50] <+Sebenoth> he is attractive, but also evil.. therefore morally gray
[3:06:52] <%JenovasPuppet> Oh yeah, Incredibles 2 was super obvious
[3:06:55] <%SvenHolgersson> @peachsaliva how about the bad guy in the Secret of Nimh 2?
[3:06:55] <+cvp5127> but money
[3:06:56] <DatAsuna> or whatever that thing after kuja was
[3:07:00] <+ClericOfSparda> The fact that he was the youngest of like 8 brothers and a Nobleman told me right away Hans was power hungry
[3:07:05] <%DesuDesuDokiDoki> mhm
[3:07:05] <$Hylian726> the uncle in Spider Verse was a cool twist
[3:07:07] <+Mekhet09> Frozen is such a mess.
[3:07:08] <Coystick> Wow that would have been interesting
[3:07:12] <+RealThiele> necron was the onlyy stumbling point for ff9
[3:07:14] <DandyMackeroos> They could’ve done that
[3:07:16] <%spiritofmojave> that would've been actually neat
[3:07:16] <%SMuffinMan> Asuna, Necron
[3:07:18] <l33tc4k3> necron or something? that boss thing was dope tho
[3:07:19] <+Archphronimos> "The Ice Witch" fairy tale has the ice powered lady as the villain
[3:07:20] <TurtlesAndTentacles> The grimm tale has her as a villain
[3:07:20] <+linSP> disney always fucks up the source
[3:07:22] <l33tc4k3> *theme
[3:07:23] <+Mothman007> Thanks for reading my stupid joke on your last stream, FF4 has a special place in my heart because I watched my dad play it as a kid
[3:07:27] <DatAsuna> yeah necron
[3:07:28] <zamzoph> @PeachSaliva it still remains that the message of "Let It Go" is actually not good. And Elsa recognizes it as a mistake by the end
[3:07:31] <derap41> in the original story she kidnaps kids
[3:07:33] <+Archphronimos> or Ice Queen fairytale maybe...
[3:07:40] <%SMuffinMan> Necron was cool tho
[3:07:44] <KingKZ> Villain Elsa would've saved the movie for me.
[3:07:44] <DandyMackeroos> What was Necron again?
[3:07:47] <+RealThiele> no response confirmed

[3:07:53] <l33tc4k3> some guy
[3:08:00] <DatAsuna> That's always the worst shit in FF, spend the whole game building up a villain then replace him for a big pointless monster that's actually behind everything
[3:08:02] <Coystick> FIGHT
[3:08:04] <+trustycoyote> @Hylian726 It really was.

[3:08:17] <@SoFarFetched> damn
[3:08:20] <kindashagg> good swerve
[3:08:20] <TurtlesAndTentacles> Nice dodge Paige
[3:08:21] <Badgerconda_> Paige likes women more than Pat does
[3:08:23] <+Sebenoth> but what if the WERE two pats
[3:08:24] <+Jasek7> did she beat smelter? i had to step away from the cringe
[3:08:25] <+luckypineapple> GO TO THE FUCKING DOCTOR
[3:08:27] <+cvp5127> so no glasses ever
[3:08:30] <@SoFarFetched> yeah she beat smelter and Iron King
[3:08:36] <DandyMackeroos> @datasuna Kinda sucks Kuja isn’t the last big boss
[3:08:36] <%SMuffinMan> Necron was supposed to end all suffering by kilking everybody
[3:08:38] <+RealThiele> Delter king
[3:08:45] <TurtlesAndTentacles> Lies
[3:08:46] <%SMuffinMan> Killing*
[3:08:48] <l33tc4k3> i mean i guess at least you know who Ultimecia is for most of FF8...
[3:08:58] <+trustycoyote> @PeachSaliva Duality of Paige
[3:08:58] <Valentinius_Anodyne> Ya gotta allocate points'

[3:09:15] <%oda_flobunaga> hork
[3:09:16] <BeefyQueefer> Paige's body is a temple. Filled with relics and old men on their knees.
[3:09:16] <l33tc4k3> also the The Extreme is also dope
[3:09:19] <%SvenHolgersson> Paige would be a genius without the hot bod just like Pat
[3:09:20] <DatAsuna> what was that big scrap dragon in ff12 about again?
[3:09:23] <%OopsyDoops> great job tonight Paige don't give up, skeleton!
[3:09:26] <%SMuffinMan> Ultimecia is namedropped early disc 3
[3:09:29] <Valentinius_Anodyne> Yu Yevon was built up to at least, I wouldn't say they're on the same level
[3:09:38] <Coystick> delter demon
[3:09:46] <DandyMackeroos> President Shinra to Rufus is pretty good and you always know Sephiroth is the ultimate bad guy
[3:09:48] <%oda_flobunaga> @PeachSaliva Paige's body is a temple in the city of Pompeii
[3:09:49] <+RealThiele> also speaking of necron, fuuuuuuuck grand cross
[3:09:49] <+genowyn> Necron is the only one I can think of that this 100% applies to
[3:10:15] <DatAsuna> Nah cloud of darkness is the worst it ever was
[3:10:19] <%SMuffinMan> Cloud of Darkness FF3 also
[3:10:28] <+genowyn> Ah true never beat 3
[3:10:33] <DatAsuna> not that xanthe was a great villain
[3:10:40] <DatAsuna> but cloud of darkness literally gets nothing
[3:10:42] <DandyMackeroos> Cause Cloud of D literally just appears at the very very end?
[3:10:51] <+FackinCrazy> What about what on screen
[3:10:53] <%SMuffinMan> CoD has a great theme tho
[3:10:55] <DatAsuna> She's just a big spoopy cloud of evil
[3:10:58] <@Jekado> DO MERCH
[3:10:59] <%RileyOMalley> Let me help with merrrrch
[3:11:03] <%ElenaManetta> Have a uh

[3:11:05] <+soundcloud_raptor> GET PEACH'D
[3:11:05] <%ElenaManetta> Peach stress ball
[3:11:05] <lotharrio> Paige the first step isn't cool. It's proving that your brand will sell.
[3:11:06] <$Agami23> why not just a sillohette of you flexing that says "ruby weapon hour" on the arms?
[3:11:10] <%UvBenServed> Get Smelt
[3:11:10] <%RafflesiaA> A big spoopy super hot cloud of evil
[3:11:11] <DandyMackeroos> “RUDE”
[3:11:13] <%ElenaManetta> a skull with a peach in its mouth
[3:11:14] <%spiritofmojave> Whoever suggested the drooling peach was SUPER RIGHT
[3:11:14] <+Sebenoth> white fluffy hat with derpy crossed eyes
[3:11:15] <+RealThiele> rude
[3:11:18] <DatAsuna> She wasn't hot until dissidia
[3:11:18] <lotharrio> Paige, see the cartoon you have on stream right now?
[3:11:20] <@SoFarFetched> it would be SUCH a HUGE inside joke
[3:11:20] <@Jekado> Aquire money disregard Smelter
[3:11:22] <%Bt_Robot> BLIND IN BOLD LETTERS
[3:11:24] <lotharrio> Just do that .
[3:11:24] <%oda_flobunaga> Logo= a SUNSET

[3:11:34] <EyeFarted> Can you put "RUBY WEAPON" on a shirt without getting in trouble with Square?
[3:11:35] <Nekros4442> Logo shoul;d be a peach at sunset
[3:11:37] <Arek_1> A brain wearing broken glasses.
[3:11:41] <zamzoph> What a coincidence!
[3:11:42] <weissguard> A Persona 5 style All Out Attack Screen that says get SMELT
[3:11:43] <+RealThiele> also BLOODBORNE as a wearable
[3:11:44] <%RafflesiaA> Wasn't the DS remake before Dissidia?
[3:11:44] <+ClericOfSparda> RUBY WEAPON HOUR with your profile pic
[3:11:45] <%OswaldTheDog> A peach on fire.
[3:11:47] <+genowyn> Does Shinryu sort of count for the big dumb monster bait and switch conversation? I guess he was established before hand but...
[3:11:49] <Valentinius_Anodyne> It's a very good villain song
[3:11:51] <DatAsuna> Spoken like a true rare fan
[3:11:59] <%ElenaManetta> The boss is really cool but the actual gameplay is almost irritating
[3:12:02] <DandyMackeroos> It’s quite good
[3:12:05] <%OswaldTheDog> Paige: a peach on fire. A smoked peach girl!!
[3:12:08] <%SMuffinMan> CoD was hot in the NES version. HUGE TITS
[3:12:21] <+RealThiele> Punished Peach
[3:12:22] <%ssjklyco> I hate that microsoft killed the character
[3:12:32] <+Sebenoth> a peach with geordie's visor saying "who said that?"
[3:12:35] <%oda_flobunaga> Shirt Idea... The Marriage TIT with an arrow pointing to it
[3:12:41] <Coystick> You're NOT the big rat
[3:12:43] <DandyMackeroos> And all it took was not caring about Conker
[3:12:43] <+trekkie11041> never forget young conker
[3:12:46] <%AncelDeLambert> Paige's body is a massive dick and it's stealing all the blood
