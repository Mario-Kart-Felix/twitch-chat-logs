[0:10:17] <element_of_loyalty> Pat sinks like a rock
[0:10:17] <arcadeking48> Its fitting that Paige is only interested in the disaster, because she herself is a disaster. She is attracted to what she is familiar with.
[0:10:17] <Smolkupo> wouldn't Pat float too?
[0:10:18] <%AnAsianToaster> every boat ever launched has sunk

[1:29:03] <SatansDick1> lucid
[1:29:05] <Solidus_113> you mean livid
[1:29:06] <faegbeard> IT MEANS AWARE

[1:29:07] <deviljhojho94> She woke

[1:29:08] <+SNAFUed1> WOKE PAIGE
[1:29:08] <%Picabunny> lucid means... in control, right?
[1:29:09] <+smargh1015> think of lucid dreaming pat
[1:29:09] <subjectg> woke af
[1:29:10] <Dr_Donkey_Brains> clear headed
[1:29:10] <element_of_loyalty> URBAN define - Lucid
[1:29:11] <DedlokPM> Lucid means clear mind @PeachSaliva
[1:29:11] <Oxybe> i got quoted :D
[1:29:13] <+Griffin1171> woke
[1:29:14] <b1gboss007> just a little bit lucid
[1:29:15] <+skizzuto> it means she's aware of her surroundings
[1:29:15] <RagnarokAM> No that's flacid dummy
[1:29:15] <%SoarFlyer> AWARE
[1:29:15] <SatansDick1> it means aware
[1:29:15] <%GeneralSCPatton> Who needs stairs when you have the Space Stone? What do you think we are? A puny mortal?
[1:29:16] <cjsugar> she used it right, I think
[1:29:16] <DandyMackeroos> Maybe?
[1:29:16] <%TheGershon> Nah it's aware and in control

[1:29:17] <+SolidusRex> Both are not wrong actually.
[1:29:18] <%PapaSatanSangLouie> Fact checking will ruin the stream.
[1:29:18] <SkyPirateArcane> Lucid usually means of sound mind
[1:29:19] <Mrkoolman23> I always figure lucid means aware
[1:29:20] <deviljhojho94> Lucid Lucy and Woke Brock
[1:29:21] <element_of_loyalty> STAIRS
[1:29:21] <%StridentSong> Lucid means clear-minded

[1:29:23] <AImano97> conscious
[1:29:23] <+twohitgood> of course pat sees everything in terms relative to his lack of sanity
[1:29:25] <+FastmanJones> It means aware of your state
[1:29:25] <Parapattern> It means not dreaming
