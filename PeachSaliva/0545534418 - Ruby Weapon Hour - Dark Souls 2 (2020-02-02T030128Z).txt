[0:43:40] <scrumbotime> Paige, I mean this as kindly as I possibly can, you are an actual medical marvel. Every time you tell us a new thing that God Afflicted You With I become more convinced that there is a wizard actively throwing curses at you like a pitching machine.

[0:54:14] <+crimsonharvest> I think paige may be a pain elemental, who lives only to experience novel suffering
[0:54:15] <corepercentlives> One Trick - Doctors Hate It
[0:54:16] <+Lunarhawk> No one can help you when Paige is involved. Not even God.

[1:05:00] <$GarbageNirvana> Thank God you're on that Canadian health care now huh
[1:05:00] <peachy996> Nothing is scarier from this point on
[1:05:01] <juxtest> Does Paige exist outside of reality in a dimension of pure sickness
[1:05:03] <chainedwolfstress> fukkin sick
[1:05:03] <$Varlinator> She IS a House episode :O
[1:05:04] <%lifer4earth> might just be associating not being able to move limbs as the locked in thing
[1:05:05] <%QueequegTheater> @PeachSaliva So, do you know that Lupus can be treated and you can live well into old age with it nowadays? I was listening to some old streams and it freaked me out. Please don't be fatalistic.

[2:23:02] <BeefyQueefer> advice: make a weapon before exploring too much
[2:23:06] <+Shacklebox> remember you die at night
[2:23:07] <juxtest> Is Daedalus working with the trees
[2:23:08] <%Jekado> so if you dick around too much you die i think
[2:23:08] <+BinaryForest> Days are decently long
[2:23:14] <+luftraumm1> if I recall shift runs
[2:23:15] <+Rinkimah> Time does progress and you will die if you're not at your base after dark (You also want to barricade because baddies will try and get inside)

[3:06:31] <KaseKaizer> BIO-CURSE stripFear
[3:06:32] <%SoFarFetched> @billyup00 man I would love to see her play Fatal Frame.
[3:06:39] <%SoFarFetched> @TheDewdHole yes eldritch horror
[3:06:39] <+IrishWeegee> the kids been dead for x number of years
[3:06:46] <DJR33DY> I think I'd just tell people husher disappeared before entering that freak ass mansion
[3:06:47] <%jaythemighty> The curse of the Trikey Man?
[3:06:50] <%TheDewdHole> oh shit
[3:06:57] <Dragon_Batman> Supposedly a spookem game yes

[3:07:11] <billyup00> that face is spook as hell
[3:07:15] <mobiusnightshade> It's the wheel from Rubber, reincarnated as a tricycle.
[3:07:20] <+Mitchellsocks> Oh this is EURO JANK!
[3:07:22] <+UnpronounceableName> it's a requirement for horror characters
[3:07:26] <Huntercd> Fatal Frame has women for Paige to murder?
[3:07:26] <%ShockzNDrawe> Paige he said he had one earlier
[3:07:28] <silverira> TAKE A FAT DUMP IN THE CARPET AND LEAVE
[3:07:33] <MetroidSlayerP7> He starts yelling "Jason!" for unknown reasons
[3:07:34] <%CommanderSqueaks> Your light source WILL NEVER RUN OUT.
[3:07:34] <+PalmtopNami> ALEX SHEPPARD
[3:07:36] <Dhurkst> This is so bad, it's good.
[3:07:36] <Zaphire_Saucypants> I assume we'll be getting lots of Poe and Lovecraft references in this game.
[3:07:37] <damienlunas> Dang it there are too many cool people streaming cool stuff at one time
[3:07:41] <Dragon_Batman> Awesome actually
[3:07:43] <+IrishWeegee> good call devs
[3:07:46] <Srthunda> Did this animal just leave the front door open
[3:07:47] <%TheDewdHole> is there a Jason button?
[3:07:47] <Zaphire_Saucypants> which I don't mind.
[3:07:52] <MayorRev> thank you developers
[3:07:56] <KaseKaizer> leaving the door open lika an animal DansGame
[3:07:58] <billyup00> it's only $8 on steam so yeah there will be jank
[3:07:58] <%Keyd00d> shitstorm FeelsBadMan
[3:07:59] <%SoFarFetched> like that Ju-on game on the Wii
[3:08:01] <MayorRev> Half Life is fine
[3:08:02] <%AncelDeLambert> PAT IS SUPER RIGHT!
[3:08:05] <XzileGaming> i really miss the shotstorm
[3:08:08] <%SoFarFetched> that shit had flashlight batteries you had to keep refilling
[3:08:10] <MayorRev> Half Life's flashlight is ok
[3:08:11] <Mr_Loboto> i thought that was a candle mounted flashlight
[3:08:12] <XzileGaming> shitstorm*
[3:08:12] <+Zioneto> I miss shitstorm timmacHANDS
[3:08:12] <keyworthe> ah christ opening old wounds
[3:08:12] <Dragon_Batman> I hate them too
[3:08:14] <%CommanderSqueaks> Especially since most flash lights can be left on for a whole day and might still keep going.
[3:08:15] <keyworthe> fuck sake pat
[3:08:16] <+IrishWeegee> especially the ones that you can literally watch the meter drain
[3:08:16] <MayorRev> because you have gun
[3:08:17] <Zaphire_Saucypants> as do I
[3:08:19] <try_it_sis_> is this clemps...
[3:08:24] <zaptar13> Non euclidean geometry I'm going insane NOOOO
[3:08:25] <filialpails> shit in this guy's toilet
[3:08:25] <AlasterAngelo> Whens the next shitstorm?
[3:08:30] <%SoFarFetched> Damn Daniel
[3:08:30] <Huntercd> Steal this guys shit
[3:08:31] <DandyMackeroos> It’s an arbitrary mechanic that limited battery
[3:08:33] <ZeeJiggle> Alan Wake is the only game that did limited batteries well, cuz it was just ammo
[3:08:36] <DJR33DY> Yep ominous music box, f outta dodge my dude
[3:08:39] <MetroidSlayerP7> Flashlights should have battery meters, but they should be several hours long per battery.
[3:08:39] <billyup00> whos joe
[3:09:02] <%garagon31> As someone who uses flashlights in his work I can say that they do in fact go dead after five minutes
[3:09:06] <%CommanderSqueaks> I forgot what game, but it had one of those shitty hand crank lights so it made sense that it ran out and all you had to do was take a second to recharge it.
[3:09:19] <AlasterAngelo> Samoa joe
[3:09:33] <%TheDewdHole> joe momma
[3:09:38] <MetroidSlayerP7> crank light in games is interesting idea
[3:09:39] <%rooooooooooot> mom
[3:09:40] <%CommanderSqueaks> @garagon31 Yes, when all of the flashlights are 10+ and no one knows when the last time the bulb/battery was changed.
[3:09:45] <+wmeldrum> hard 180 degre-rule break
[3:09:53] <Dhurkst> What a drastic shift from Darkwood, lol

[3:12:40] <Oxybe> THIS MAN HAS NO *** SPENT YEARS STUDYING HISTORY, I SPENT THAT TIME STUDYING THE BLADE.
[3:12:42] <KnightofNights2> This isn't Dark Souls?

[3:12:49] <TheHeroAppears> @arsonistdaria she played it off stream
[3:12:52] <%arsonistdaria> oh that makes sense
[3:12:56] <%CommanderSqueaks> Disco Elysium is one of my favorite games now, but fuck if it's not a game to stream.
[3:12:58] <%SoFarFetched> NO PAIGE
[3:12:58] <+theraden> Man Luigi's Mansion 3 looks different

[3:14:19] <TheHeroAppears> it's a music box that plays one winged angel
[3:14:28] <DJR33DY> weird that it specifies that Daniel found the letter, as if you could play as someone else
[3:14:29] <BabbittDog> "you hear the serene melody echoing through the cavern"
[3:14:35] <ElemethSigma> What if you play the music box and the song is the Youtube National Anthem?
[3:14:36] <%SoFarFetched> Anyway here's wonderwall
[3:14:37] <Rostichenburg> It's a demon box isn't it?
[3:14:39] <zaptar13> Not even a good song.
[3:14:44] <ElenaManetta> I applaud any game that goes through the extra effort to write the actual letter on the letter instead of gibberish with subtitles
[3:14:53] <person181> he's already dead
[3:14:54] <filialpails> I hope everyone remembered to take their antimimetic eardrops today
[3:14:55] <%arsonistdaria> the song is that little bee song

[3:21:16] <%CommanderSqueaks> Big strength
[3:21:19] <Oxybe> RUSSIAN ALCOHOLIC SUPERSTENG5H

[3:22:18] <chhdez> It's strem teim

[3:25:47] <Huntercd> Three days and they haven't called the cops? Damn they must not care about him
[3:25:48] <mobiusnightshade> That's why you don't fuck with hellscape doors.
[3:25:50] <person181> yeah why use a candle though, the wax will hit your hand
[3:25:53] <%rooooooooooot> E
[3:25:59] <ElenaManetta> She's using some kind of candle holding tool
[3:25:59] <Ranger747> this game was made by aliens
[3:26:01] <Oxybe> nah man. she's a setup character. yankee candle combos are beastly.

[3:39:56] <%ShockzNDrawe> If you pull on Paige's braids, her eyes pop out and she screams at you
[3:39:58] <DJR33DY> The search list is gonna grow as the game progresses won't it, next chapter will be "man where did Husher, Daniel, AND Sophie disappear to?"
[3:39:59] <Dragon_Batman> I don't remember them playing this on a shitstorm
[3:40:08] <ElenaManetta> Its actually a TERRIBLE place

[3:40:43] <Coystick> Is this how you act during one of Canada's famous blackouts?
[3:40:44] <%SoFarFetched> should be bottom door I think
[3:40:46] <Neo_Kaiser> When Paige first visited Pats house, she looked everywhere for places to hide.
[3:40:52] <MetroidSlayerP7> Does Evil take Residence here?
[3:40:55] <DandyMackeroos> Make sure to pick up some kerosene tol

[3:56:32] <+Th3SmartAlec> Good thing you have a map
[3:56:34] <%TheDewdHole> SaulsBorne
[3:56:37] <ElenaManetta> It might be parents who prompt it too, for keepsakes. My sister tells her kids to write their age on drawings so they'll remember when they get older nad look back on it
[3:56:39] <%SoFarFetched> "-accidentally runs into an eldritch horror- WHOOPSY DOODLE"

[3:57:13] <zaptar13> Slow down you're going to run into it
[3:57:13] <Dhurkst> Pretty sure kids only write their age on stuff because their parents encourage them to
[3:57:13] <Dragon_Batman> So it might be the world war 2 one
[3:57:23] <Zaphire_Saucypants> Pat hurt you with his DARK WOOD
[3:57:23] <%SoFarFetched> @PeachSaliva I get that problem with my wrist randomly at times.

[3:57:31] <+Th3SmartAlec> Guess it's 46 or something?
[3:57:34] <ElenaManetta> I feel like the dishwasher wire is leading to something in the basement
[3:57:35] <Dhurkst> like a memorabilia kind of thing
[3:57:37] <%CommanderSqueaks> Oh yeah, I'm on the computer 16 hours a day, I know that pain well.

[4:10:34] <ElenaManetta> Use a fucking knife to open the metal fuse box!!!
[4:10:41] <%garagon31> garagon31 subscribed with Twitch Prime. They've subscribed for 2 months! Had to wrestle a wife beater this month, that was fun.

[4:11:23] <Aleate> No Evil :)
[4:11:24] <ElenaManetta> a dryer.
[4:11:24] <%CommanderSqueaks> Rotting food = Evil House
[4:11:24] <%ThePuddingDead> @PeachSaliva Open door, no balls

[4:15:20] <mrlastchance1> relatively spooked
[4:15:25] <ElenaManetta> "At Protocol Games, we didn’t want players to experience Song of Horror as a game where you have lives. Instead, we believed those lives might be represented by other characters. So, if you die in Song of Horror, that death means something. This means you won’t be able to play with that character again. " -- some interview with devs
[4:15:42] <Dragon_Batman> Neat
[4:15:42] <+Dr_Mooose> still gonna need kindling

[4:17:11] <+frobeards> you can still check the painting though
[4:17:12] <Zaphire_Saucypants> the point where we combine everything with everything is coming.

[4:22:01] <%Jekado> Since its tailored to your play style paige does that mean all the mustard jars are empty?
[4:22:05] <%SoFarFetched> @ElenaManetta she probably missed a thing to examine in one of the rooms she's been in.
[4:22:08] <Neo_Kaiser> Just like in real life
[4:22:12] <TheLethalBreed> THE WARDROBE!
[4:22:12] <%depressed_skeleton> Yell swears at it
[4:22:13] <%ssjklyco> because the game knows you want to hide

[4:24:04] <majindusto> OH NO, READING MATERIAL!!!!
[4:24:06] <Dragon_Batman> MAybe closer to the wall?
[4:24:08] <%SoFarFetched> @misha_kastrilevich Song of Horror
[4:24:10] <ODSTEvan147> So it's 4 7 19
[4:24:10] <+Th3SmartAlec> False alarm
[4:24:11] <MetroidSlayerP7> *Searches* Weapons?... These are useless to me. *Gets killed by monsters*
[4:24:12] <+bread_assassin> @PeachSaliva Dining room?
[4:24:12] <Zaphire_Saucypants> you just read teh thing
[4:24:13] <%Naotox10> what the fuck
[4:24:15] <%Ell1ot> did any spooky happen yet?
[4:24:24] <%SoFarFetched> screwdriver
[4:24:26] <Zaphire_Saucypants> we were talking about the front prompt on the desk
[4:24:28] <chattychocobo> there was a spooky dog noise
[4:24:29] <%SoFarFetched> it's supposed to be on a desk.
[4:24:29] <Hellarussian> spec into a Samurai build
[4:24:34] <mobiusnightshade> The enemy AI must be so confused. XD
[4:24:35] <Neo_Kaiser> Maybe if the monster was a woman then Paige wouldn't be scared.
[4:24:39] <panzershock21> Does the globe have liqour in it?
[4:24:41] <Zaphire_Saucypants> the thing you just read, nvm.
[4:24:45] <%Naotox10> thought it was the screwdriver
[4:24:48] <%SoFarFetched> no it was for sophie.
[4:24:54] <ElenaManetta> Im watching a video of Sophie
[4:24:54] <ODSTEvan147> you got it
[4:24:57] <+GenesisPatton> "Walk"through indeed
[4:25:01] <%SoFarFetched> maybe a different Desk paige.
[4:25:01] <Hellarussian> is the game super random?
[4:25:04] <ODSTEvan147> it was 1940
[4:25:06] <chattychocobo> is the monster in this a ghost or smth?
[4:25:12] <zaptar13> The game is different every time
[4:25:13] <Neo_Kaiser> Leave it to Paige.
[4:25:15] <keyworthe> can you not run?
[4:25:17] <TheLethalBreed> Around the desk?
[4:25:18] <Dragon_Batman> Could it be related to lighting the fireplace to see it?
[4:25:19] <Zaphire_Saucypants> seems to be a point where we need to scour every prompt
[4:25:20] <Neo_Kaiser> Stop backseat gaming guys geez
[4:25:27] <Aleate> It was a man! I saw him on the stairs ruuS
[4:25:27] <%ShockzNDrawe> tbf this is about on par with how your streams usually turn out Paige
[4:25:30] <%CommanderSqueaks> Hall Wug and press every single thing.
[4:25:32] <chattychocobo> nakkiS
[4:25:39] <ODSTEvan147> go back the the room with the basement stairs
[4:25:40] <Hellarussian> draw a dickbutt on the walls
[4:25:46] <+SolverCODO> I see the real problem. The mansion is so dark, EVERYTHING is a shadow puzzle
[4:25:46] <chattychocobo> good idea
[4:25:48] <zaptar13> What about the dog thing?
[4:25:49] <TheBlackSpaceLive> Can she use the magazines for the fire?
[4:25:51] <majindusto> Paige will find New ways to mess up and get lost in games
[4:25:55] <ElenaManetta> Okay I found it
[4:25:55] <panzershock21> Backseat gaming is what these streams are about
[4:25:55] <ElemethSigma> how can we backseat a game that switches things up every game?
[4:25:57] <%Ell1ot> what if you make noise and the naked old man from the other game starts chasing you?
[4:25:57] <Dragon_Batman> There was one to your left
[4:26:01] <Aleate> No on the LEFT
[4:26:01] <ODSTEvan147> go back to the basement
[4:26:03] <+SolverCODO> on the LEFT
[4:26:04] <Neo_Kaiser> Maybe Paige can shoot the fireplace on
[4:26:06] <ElenaManetta> Go through the DOUBLE WHITE DOORS in the DINING ROOM
[4:26:07] <Zaphire_Saucypants> Elena found it, apparently?
[4:26:10] <Aleate> Dang
[4:26:10] <ElenaManetta> And there is a screwdriver on the desk.
[4:26:11] <filialpails> BOTTOM OF THE STAIRS
[4:26:16] <+SolverCODO> well darn
[4:26:17] <+Th3SmartAlec> Paige, can you open the Haiku folder?
[4:26:17] <juxtest> Cant she launch the incindiary grenades into the fire place
[4:26:19] <Hydrapissed> !uptime
[4:26:24] <+SolverCODO> Ya, open the haiku folder
[4:26:29] <+bread_assassin> Locked door in dining room @PeachSaliva
[4:26:33] <Aleate> But did you get the Gatling Gun ammo yet?
[4:26:35] <Hellarussian> walk in circles
[4:26:42] <mobiusnightshade> There's two sets of stairs/
[4:26:44] <Neo_Kaiser> Did you know that the 5, 7 and 5 thing with haikus is a total lie?
[4:26:44] <filialpails> IGNORE ME
[4:26:45] <+realm_forge> PAIGE ww2 was from 1939 to 1945
[4:26:48] <Zaphire_Saucypants> Just do what Elena says.
[4:26:49] <+GenesisPatton> I hear shooting the ghosts in the painting with your bow works.
[4:26:50] <@MelBrooksKA> try spinning around in a circle
[4:26:52] <%SoFarFetched> "Use the key on the door that Daniel went through that led to the black goo door. There’s a note on the door that offers clues for a puzzle. On the desk you’ll find the screwdriver; use the combine button on the screwdriver and the locked box and you’ll acquire fuses."
[4:26:54] <majindusto> Circles, Eh?
[4:26:55] <+SolverCODO> :O :O :O
[4:26:56] <%Jekado> combine?
[4:27:00] <$Bane_Kaikyo> Didn't it say to check the painting UPSTAIRS by the staircase?
[4:27:02] <+mixedelirium> Combine with matches at fireplace?
[4:27:07] <%Jekado> can you combine it with something
[4:27:13] <Dragon_Batman> Is it in the dining room area?
[4:27:13] <ElemethSigma> wait wait, can you pet the dog?
[4:27:15] <%depressed_skeleton> RUN!
[4:27:17] <+Th3SmartAlec> @Jekado @mixedelirium We tried that
[4:27:20] <%ShockzNDrawe> watch there be a hidden timer
[4:27:21] <+bread_assassin> This is a chat full of One Guys now
[4:27:25] <+Estuko> if a monster comes out, just use Royal Guard and parry his ass
[4:27:25] <%SoFarFetched> @mixedelirium she apparentlyt needs one more thing for the fireplace.
[4:27:25] <%Jekado> ah
[4:27:27] <%ShockzNDrawe> and she runs out of time
[4:27:28] <Hellarussian> 39-45
[4:27:30] <panzershock21> 38 to 45
[4:27:31] <Neo_Kaiser> "We tried nothing, and we're all out of ideas!"
[4:27:31] <ElenaManetta> @PeachSaliva Go into the Dining Room. There is a white doubled-door in there you need to unlock.
[4:27:32] <@MelBrooksKA> Brute smarts
[4:27:32] <+SolverCODO> never checked that briefcase right there either
[4:27:33] <TheLethalBreed> The SPOOKY!
[4:27:37] <%ssjklyco> Brute Smarts

[4:27:49] <Dragon_Batman> No I think you did the kitchen door
[4:27:51] <ElenaManetta> Then you missed the screwdriver in that room on the desk.
[4:27:52] <%SoFarFetched> last two numbers aren't for WW2

[4:28:29] <snowmuttplays> BRUTE SMARTS
[4:28:29] <Dragon_Batman> You might trigger something earlier than you should
[4:28:30] <%SoFarFetched> It's unfortunately not between 35-45 for the last two numbers.
[4:28:31] <+burlybeef> do it
[4:28:31] <%ThePuddingDead> brute force no balls
[4:28:33] <Neo_Kaiser> Every time you fail the monster gets closer
[4:28:35] <+realm_forge> 666666666666666666666
[4:28:35] <Hydrapissed> OH GOD its gana blow up
[4:28:36] <ElemethSigma> I'm guessing 3945
[4:28:38] <%XeroSigmaPrime> this is gonna take WAYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYY too long
[4:28:38] <Zaphire_Saucypants> should probably start with 1
[4:28:42] <+burlybeef> 1
[4:28:43] <majindusto> ET TU, BRUTE?
[4:28:45] <RAPHCOM> Saul would be cool with it
[4:28:45] <ElenaManetta> Im enjoying this
[4:28:50] <ElenaManetta> Ive never gone into a horror game so blind
[4:28:51] <Ion_Laser> brute forcing a 4 pin safe is going to take a very very long time
[4:28:53] <%CommanderSqueaks> Literally nothing has happened yet Peach.
[4:28:55] <derap41> there are only 10000 combinations how hard can it be
[4:28:55] <TheLethalBreed> 5491?
[4:28:56] <ElenaManetta> I usually know at least the premise
[4:28:56] <snowmuttplays> Oh no, the witch's curse has come back to haunt Paige yet again o--o;
[4:28:56] <+Dr_Mooose> this is not gonna end well
[4:29:00] <%XeroSigmaPrime> This is gonna be longer than actually finding it
[4:29:01] <Hellarussian> 1111
[4:29:01] <ElenaManetta> I never heard of this game until this stream
[4:29:02] <sharpington_> @PeachSaliva should the first 2 numbers be 19 for a year?
[4:29:03] <%SoFarFetched> Paige do you want the code?
[4:29:03] <+AllAccordingToPlan> KEEP GOING
[4:29:03] <MetroidSlayerP7> The meat is full of fear
[4:29:04] <KaseKaizer> mm mmmh

[4:29:07] <+Flambage> @PeachSaliva Time to start from 0001
[4:29:10] <Hellarussian> 1112
[4:29:11] <%ShockzNDrawe> You gave up super hard
[4:29:12] <zaptar13> The monster has a harder time finding you if you turn off your light
[4:29:15] <keyworthe> fuck the music is scary
[4:29:15] <chattychocobo> I don't like these noises
[4:29:16] <Dragon_Batman> I would go for the dining room
[4:29:17] <Nox_ludicro> I guess the painting in question isn't related to WW2
[4:29:18] <Zaphire_Saucypants> maybe start with **1*
[4:29:19] <keyworthe> fck
[4:29:20] <+GenesisPatton> WW2 never ended, I guess.
[4:29:23] <%SoFarFetched> @PeachSaliva Paige did you want me to give you the code? or you wanna guess it.
[4:29:33] <TheLethalBreed> THE MUSIC!
[4:29:33] <ElenaManetta> Dining room!

[4:29:52] <%CommanderSqueaks> Evil nearby.
[4:29:53] <RAPHCOM> Only thing I can think of is you missed a prompt where you got the wood.

[4:45:52] <hntronium> I think 10v is yellow so bottom left
[4:45:57] <oceanmatt> isnt it just addition
[4:45:58] <%SoFarFetched> At the top left it should be 25, the top right should be 15, the bottom left should be 20, and the bottom right is 10a.
[4:46:00] <%RedMageRebel> I'm colorblind as fuck I ain't any use for this
[4:46:01] <+SolverCODO> a dark mansion is just one big shadow puzzle
[4:46:02] <Smaenus> But she don't want yellow..
[4:46:04] <Coystick> She doesn't want yellow
[4:46:06] <+Dr_Mooose> 25 might be top left

[4:46:18] <Ranger747> naw
[4:46:19] <Coystick> Go Sorth
[4:46:19] <%SoFarFetched> @PeachSaliva At the top left it should be 25, the top right should be 15, the bottom left should be 20, and the bottom right is 10a.

[4:46:25] <%ssjklyco> top right is 20
[4:46:25] <juxtest> You might be overthinking it thanks to bad advice from the chat
[4:46:26] <Dragon_Batman> Does it need to add up from the left box?
[4:46:27] <%Naotox10> LOOK AT SOFARFETCHED
[4:46:28] <Smaenus> Damn Smarch weather

[4:46:32] <TheLethalBreed> Crazy? ye
[4:46:33] <@PinkieTheEerie> At this point i think nobody understands you, includeing yourself
[4:46:33] <%SoFarFetched> PAY ATTENTION TO ME SENPAI
[4:46:35] <%Jekado> i'd be hilarious if the game knows your getting help from stream so the game creates bots to give you wrong answer through twitch to fuck with you
[4:46:35] <%CommanderSqueaks> SO FAR FETCHED IS CORRECT.
[4:46:36] <SomeSageAdvice> the wattage is on the left, you're combining the numbers depending on the wires
[4:46:36] <Hellarussian> look at the wire coloring and where they go
[4:46:36] <%AncelDeLambert> @PeachSaliva it's easy, Paige, everyone is wrong
[4:46:38] <%SoFarFetched> At the top left it should be 25, the top right should be 15, the bottom left should be 20, and the bottom right is 10a.
[4:46:42] <%Naotox10> PAIGE
[4:46:43] <panzershock21> Man I hate games that make me do maths

[4:46:56] <ElenaManetta> The solution makes no sense
[4:46:57] <%CommanderSqueaks> Jut do what Far Fetched says, they're probably right.
[4:46:59] <TonberryLives> I'm not colorblind and I can"t see fuck all for this
[4:46:59] <hntronium> Is 10v on the bottom left?

[4:58:47] <ElenaManetta> why do we have to use the most full washcloth ever
[4:58:51] <%TheDewdHole> use the cooch rag on the cooch fluids
[4:58:52] <%Jekado> good advice
[4:58:53] <ElenaManetta> i bet it doesnt even have any absorbent left
[4:58:59] <%CommanderSqueaks> This would NOT fix the problem.
[4:58:59] <Slimeking_Mike> Momp it up
[4:59:00] <trianglehat> RIP puddle
[4:59:00] <+jepupu> Best spooks are those, that keep you waiting and anxious. The moment too much happens is the moment, when it stops being scary.

[4:59:36] <ElenaManetta> Entire wire
[4:59:37] <TheWinged7> is it a rubber chicken moment

[4:59:57] <Coystick> Elmo is h u n t i n g
[5:00:00] <JonEWorldbeater> BAYBEE
[5:00:04] <ElenaManetta> That wire should just be useless
[5:00:05] <+Th3SmartAlec> Sophie's coice, even
[5:00:06] <+Yukasmarvin> You don't need to fix that wire, but it being wet just shorted the fuses out
[5:00:06] <%Jekado> elmo loops time
[5:00:07] <%CommanderSqueaks> Wet rag = touching hand + touching wire = FRIED SOPHIE
[5:00:07] <DJR33DY> Okay i'm still waiting for the photo to bite everybody in the ass and it's making me anxious
[5:00:08] <RubberFistFight> @PinkieTheEerie not necessarily, depends on the voltage going through it. the breakdown voltage of air is actually rather high.
[5:00:11] <%ShockzNDrawe> That's such a Sophie thing to do
[5:00:12] <Dragon_Batman> Elmo must do the loop
[5:00:14] <%SoFarFetched> Pat's ghost farting
[5:00:16] <Nox_ludicro> Pat's haunted
[5:00:17] <ElenaManetta> It should've short circuited and burnt itself out

[5:00:50] <panzershock21> You are fucking up
[5:00:53] <@PinkieTheEerie> @RubberFistFight in a room with like 200% percent humidity? a lot easier, also if it shorts out a fuse its useing a STUPID ammount of power
[5:00:58] <%ShockzNDrawe> just pretend all the noises in game are Pat trying to eat chocolates and he doesn't want you to find him again
[5:01:02] <RubberFistFight> @TheWinged7 it's like that one scene from Ghostbusters that Dan Aykroyd fought to keep in.

[5:01:41] <keyworthe> SUCK IT EVIL
[5:01:41] <RubberFistFight> @PinkieTheEerie you'd be very surprised. All shorting a fuse out means is that the circuit exceeded the current rating of the fuse. You can do that simply by plugging too many big appliances into one circuit.
[5:01:42] <%TheDewdHole> WE COMING DANIEL
[5:01:42] <chattychocobo> no way there isn't a spook now

[5:04:01] <ElenaManetta> Why does the house shake?!
[5:04:02] <Fien111> No Paige, by now it's early
[5:04:03] <snowmuttplays> Pat goes into the jewelry business by systematically terrifying Paige into an early grave.
[5:04:05] <%CommanderSqueaks> It's the ghost.
[5:04:10] <QaizerArt> Hey @RedMageRebel don't look behind you. Don't.
[5:04:11] <%SoFarFetched> @ElenaManetta maybe it's chilly
[5:04:12] <chattychocobo> I'm watching this small as possible like a true coward
[5:04:12] <%TheDewdHole> "Pat I'm scared please come down"
[5:04:16] <PrettyThickandStrongDyck> hey Paige I just finished watching toonami what happened so far?
[5:04:20] <%SoFarFetched> Time to fuck that boiler paige.
[5:04:22] <KaliasTV> The Email reads: DON'T READ THIS EMAIL
[5:04:22] <Midnight188> just think of the ghost as a skeleton and it'll be fine
[5:04:24] <Run44forrest> Pat: this is how i win
[5:04:24] <sharpington_> I wonder if it pays attention to you pausing and assumed you're scared

[5:04:36] <Zaphire_Saucypants> so is this gonna be a multi-stream game @PeachSaliva
[5:04:37] <PrettyThickandStrongDyck> is pat still there
[5:04:41] <@PinkieTheEerie> @RubberFistFight yeaaaa...you wouldent even need a lot to be honest. just brush it onto their skin and their fucked. its not so much the pump disruption thats scary, its the fact that HF has a runaway reaction with calcium. basicly, it EATS ALL YOUR BONES
[5:04:50] <%Jekado> this place is MOIST
[5:05:00] <TheLethalBreed> Sploosh!
[5:05:02] <ElenaManetta> Mannnn the owners of this house better fucking THANK you for fixing their shit up
[5:05:02] <%VashyronM> Working as intended
[5:05:04] <Nox_ludicro> @PrettyThickandStrongDyck Pat went to bed
[5:05:05] <Dragon_Batman> Pat went upstairs to maybe sleep
[5:05:08] <@PinkieTheEerie> @RubberFistFight maybe like .3 or .5 moler and their screwed
[5:05:12] <%SoFarFetched> yeah I think you need to check it
[5:05:16] <snowmuttplays> MUSTY, one might say
[5:05:19] <RubberFistFight> @PinkieTheEerie yup. That shit is proper fucking scary. Luckily it's also relatively easy to treat if the exposure is small and you get help in time. But it's still not great.
[5:05:21] <+Th3SmartAlec> Upstairs now?
[5:05:21] <panzershock21> Whats a grosser word, Moist or gushing

[5:07:15] <snowmuttplays> Can we just
[5:07:16] <panzershock21> Turns the heat on?
[5:07:16] <snowmuttplays> Appreciate

[5:07:22] <Nox_ludicro> Painting
[5:07:25] <QaizerArt> @Run44forrest Each button had a color when pressed. Right button was blue.
[5:07:31] <snowmuttplays> Just standing in front of the door like that?
[5:07:34] <snowmuttplays> The lighting was dope
[5:07:36] <%SoFarFetched> Yeah think the picture is somewhere else @PeachSaliva because when you go upstairs there's a painting missing.
[5:07:37] <ElenaManetta> Go upstairs and see if you can see Pat showering
[5:07:38] <Nox_ludicro> The painting in that last room had a prompt
[5:07:43] <ElenaManetta> It'll be the biggest scare of all
[5:07:47] <@PinkieTheEerie> @RubberFistFight yea but only if noticed withen like 4 hours. if you brush it on to skin enough to absorb but not enough to burn them....they wouldent know untill its FAR too late. maybe not death but their not gonna live a happy life
[5:07:47] <KaliasTV> The light switch says "don't turn on the lights"
[5:07:48] <%Naotox10> its good the lighting still makes it scary
[5:07:49] <Dragon_Batman> Yea, add some shadowing and shit changes
[5:07:49] <%Jekado> light is gonna make it harder to hide from the spooker
[5:07:51] <ElenaManetta> Really?

[5:15:22] <%SoFarFetched> @ElenaManetta In the prelude,he calls Daniel to help get a manuscript from the guy's missing house.
[5:15:23] <%Jekado> you could already be in a alternate universe ala silent hill and therefore stuck
[5:15:24] <ElenaManetta> Maybe the cops are working with the ghosts
[5:15:30] <Aleate> @Midnight188 Fuck it just burn the house down, stop calling us lady
[5:15:30] <ElenaManetta> oooohh

[5:15:44] <Knoxx_Gold> The cops are in on the ghost racket
[5:15:45] <QaizerArt> Wait, who the hell wrote letters in 98? Couldn't Isaac just have called the Husher dude?
[5:15:46] <DJR33DY> "3 people have gone missing should we call the cops?" "Nah i'll just keep sending the writers in, one of them will get it done"

[5:16:14] <ElenaManetta> did they draw this in blood?
[5:16:15] <%SoFarFetched> @RedMageRebel Think that's if they got no leads at all and have to hope a psychic knows stuff.
[5:16:19] <+Th3SmartAlec> LUL

[5:17:00] <%RedMageRebel> @sofarfetched i just wonder who decides to make that call cause I'm sure there's a lot of skeptics making fun of it
[5:17:01] <sharpington_> giggles or sobs?
[5:17:04] <%ShockzNDrawe> is her audio like super muffled?
[5:17:07] <Nox_ludicro> G'night everybody

[5:17:12] <%VashyronM> Just burn the house to the ground and leave
[5:17:13] <%SoFarFetched> @RedMageRebel I assume higher ups that are in charge of the case.
[5:17:18] <Dragon_Batman> Is that suppose to be the kid stuck in the room from the phone call earlier maybe?
[5:17:24] <Zaphire_Saucypants> but it's not oval
[5:17:27] <%SoFarFetched> It's not that one.

[5:18:22] <sharpington_> oohh I bet the writer got a super haunted ass reference book and fucked everything up
[5:18:23] <Oxybe> So many stone masks... konno Sophie da!
[5:18:25] <%RedMageRebel> GOD, an old high-school friend has parents who are fancy artists and photographers and they have all these old ass masks and weird dolls from different countries, I always hated sleeping there
[5:18:35] <DJR33DY> This house is on a Native American burial ground ain't it. They just want their masks back
[5:18:39] <Dragon_Batman> Interesting
[5:18:39] <%Jekado> just sit in the chair and wait it out
[5:18:42] <Run44forrest> what if they made jim carrey's the mask but they used the stone mask
[5:18:43] <chattychocobo> the physics in this game are on point
[5:18:46] <%SoFarFetched> USE THAT RING
[5:18:52] <%Jekado> ghost can't catch you if your comfy
[5:18:52] <%SoFarFetched> IF YOU LIKE IT PUT A RING ON IT
[5:18:54] <Hellarussian> a Haiku
[5:18:56] <Dragon_Batman> You have to glue it yea
[5:19:02] <ElenaManetta> Fuck that
[5:19:04] <ElenaManetta> Use the tongs
[5:19:06] <ElenaManetta> I dont know
[5:19:07] <+Th3SmartAlec> Maybe in the garage?
[5:19:08] <%Naotox10> Well shit, game over man

[5:19:31] <Midnight188> adventure game logic continues
[5:19:31] <%TheDewdHole> these radio's have impeccable timing
[5:19:33] <%Naotox10> maybe here
[5:19:33] <chattychocobo> radios are the true horror
[5:19:34] <Neo_Kaiser> Ask Adam for glue, he's a horse.
[5:19:34] <Run44forrest> pat
[5:19:36] <Dragon_Batman> I think Pat is
[5:19:41] <%CommanderSqueaks> Yeah I agree.

[5:20:27] <%SoFarFetched> @CommanderSqueaks CHAU?
[5:20:29] <Midnight188> its prolly in the room you need to glue the key together to open
[5:20:29] <ElenaManetta> @PeachSaliva If you put your mouth on the keyhole and just suck in really hard, can you suck out the key part?
[5:20:35] <Midnight188> so you need glue
[5:20:39] <panzershock21> maybe the ghost mold is sticky
[5:20:40] <%Jekado> TRY SUCK
[5:20:43] <%Jekado> HARD SUCK

[5:21:13] <kingcrispy9> ah yes, the old succ key trick, classic
[5:21:14] <RubberFistFight> is that the new "she can suck a golf ball through a garden hose"? Now it's "she can suck a broken key out of a door"?

[5:27:42] <+Dr_Mooose> cute doll
[5:27:42] <%Jekado> yeah mold as a spook is pretty real because mold in real life is scary

[5:27:56] <%SoFarFetched> Yes
[5:27:56] <Zaphire_Saucypants> So wait, the number from the painting we need was really the number from the recording?

[5:28:24] <ElenaManetta> I'm gonna bet the dolly is to coax the demon child when you get into that room
[5:28:29] <JonEWorldbeater> Oh, that Doll physics is too real
[5:28:29] <Dragon_Batman> So if it works that is 2 dolls

[6:02:53] <%CommanderSqueaks> Peach, I was told by my brain doctor that Adderall can potentially cause psychosis when mixed with Weed, so don't do the Weed on the days you take your meds.

[6:12:45] <Zaphire_Saucypants> I'm paranoid about shit goin in mah lungs too.
[6:12:46] <%ssjklyco> Vape nache
[6:12:47] <%CommanderSqueaks> If you can't smoke
[6:12:54] <$Straylightgg> god I don't know if I wanna imagine either of you on edibles
[6:12:54] <Dragon_Batman> I got a friend who vapes it
[6:12:54] <%rumtumtugnutz> TeaHC
[6:12:54] <TwistedVerse> drink the weed, inhale the weed, taste the weed
[6:12:59] <+MoralCompassGaming> My sister works at the SQDC LUL
[6:13:01] <%CommanderSqueaks> I SAW that tweet.
[6:13:02] <%RedMageRebel> I prefer edibles but I like being high all God damn day, just at a chill level
[6:13:02] <+Dr_Mooose> edibles will get you
[6:13:04] <$GarbageNirvana> I had three edible mints once and was high for two days
[6:13:05] <+RenoDeGeneric> Get these little candies. I got some called Cheeba Chews and they were great
[6:13:05] <+MoralCompassGaming> younger sister
[6:13:07] <%Jekado> oh Ross
[6:13:10] <%RedMageRebel> smoking makes its worse for me
[6:13:10] <%Binary_Fireball> start tiny
[6:13:14] <HoldBtoRun> haha Ross lol
[6:13:15] <RadicalWeegee> BRO
[6:13:17] <%rumtumtugnutz> Ross also fucked Arin over with edibles
[6:13:17] <+SolverCODO> High and mighty of him to say after doing that to Arin
[6:13:18] <%CommanderSqueaks> Peach, get a brownie and split it between you and Pat.
[6:13:21] <%rumtumtugnutz> so
[6:13:26] <RadicalWeegee> Edibles fuck you up pretty hard
[6:13:26] <Dragon_Batman> LUL
[6:13:30] <+AKAMarkTwain> Microdose!! That’s how you do the edibles when you’re new to it.
[6:13:31] <%Jekado> An angel from heaven who creates hell in Mario Maker
[6:13:35] <TwistedVerse> pat would totally eat the whole brownie, and another, and run outside naked
[6:13:35] <%GabeSweetMan> @rumtumtugnutz Fucked up or fucked over?
[6:13:37] <%Ell1ot> Ross warned you and not Arin. lol
[6:13:38] <%ShockzNDrawe> ShockzNDrawe subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 12 months! Tonight's shitpost is all Elena's fault https://twitter.com/ShockzNDrawe/status/1223897440803311617
[6:13:39] <+pkmamsters> Pat the weeeeed man
[6:13:39] <$GarbageNirvana> Ross has a tendency to go ham methinks
[6:13:42] <%CommanderSqueaks> Peach, split a brownie with him.
[6:13:44] <+DukeMoose> you didnt get the sleepytime weeds?
[6:13:46] <%Sir_Gawain_Lotsson> Just tell him "Oh that's not smoke, it's steam. From the steamed clams we're having" @PeachSaliva
[6:13:52] <+TheMattman1313> @PeachSaliva Take like half a serving of an edible and let it sit.
[6:13:52] <%TheDewdHole> Edibles, liquid form or vapor is THE BEST WAY
[6:13:54] <@PinkieTheEerie> @PeachSaliva vape aint much easier onm the lungs honestly
[6:13:56] <+D00msDayDan> just inject the weed needles
[6:13:57] <%Binary_Fireball> all the brand name stuff is real consistent
[6:13:57] <%Tenchi_G> You'll b high for 24 hours if you do edibles
[6:14:00] <Ochris> He can take small bites of the edibles?
[6:14:01] <HoldBtoRun> the noob mistake, not making two sets of brownies
[6:14:02] <%Chichen> @PeachSaliva They have very low doses. Just take one.
[6:14:03] <Monkeyweed21> OH GOD DONT EAT MULTIPLE
[6:14:03] <%RedMageRebel> oh God no that's bad
[6:14:04] <TwistedVerse> inject the weed LUL
[6:14:04] <%Chichen> or half of one
[6:14:05] <%TheDewdHole> Keep the dosage low
[6:14:06] <%CommanderSqueaks> Do half of a Brownie with him.
[6:14:07] <%Naotox10> oh my god shock
[6:14:08] <%koriar> my understanding is that the reason for that is because when it goes through your stomach it breaks down different chemically
[6:14:08] <%XeroSigmaPrime> @Sir_Gawain_Lotsson Dont do that with the vape scare...
[6:14:11] <%ssjklyco> I did an edible once. it was a bad time. I was glued to my friends bed the whole night, and I thought my teeth were cutting my tongue.
[6:14:12] <%rumtumtugnutz> @gabesweetman both, really. he got edibles for Arin's first time and Arin had a bad time
[6:14:13] <$curlym0nster> okay so story time about edibles: I had a brownie and I put that shit in a blender with some ice cream to make easier to eat and that shit had me high for *three days*
[6:14:13] <DesuDesuDokiDoki> it made him very paranoid, if i recall.
[6:14:14] <%RedMageRebel> I had two and the whole room turned on its side
[6:14:15] <%koriar> but yeah just have a tiny crumb
[6:14:15] <Zaphire_Saucypants> just a nibble
[6:14:18] <+DukeMoose> they have LOW doses
[6:14:20] <+MoralCompassGaming> Half is the right way to start, and if after 2 hours you want to go higher you do the other half
[6:14:24] <%Jekado> maybe rub the weed on his orb and he gains contact high?
[6:14:28] <%ShockzNDrawe> You ok Paige?
[6:14:30] <Zaphire_Saucypants> a crumb of edible mayhaps?
[6:14:30] <%RedMageRebel> I spent the whole day giggling hysterically and cuddling a kitten
[6:14:30] <%ShockzNDrawe> you sweepy?
[6:14:39] <%rumtumtugnutz> edibles in canadia are only like 40mg so they're pretty low dose.
[6:14:39] <$Straylightgg> pats can have little a weed
[6:14:42] <+Yukasmarvin> Why do it at all in the first place?
[6:14:45] <%GabeSweetMan> Yikes. Yeah wasn't Arin like... never experienced in any kind of recreational drugs until very recently?
[6:14:46] <RadicalWeegee> like , dude i was gone for the entier night , and didnt wake up untill 4pm the next day , that was 18 hours idk i was just dead in bed
[6:14:50] <%Naotox10> MAKE?
[6:14:51] <Monkeyweed21> start with tiny little gummies and go up from there, about 5mg to start
[6:14:54] <%Binary_Fireball> the kiva mints 2.5mg @PeachSaliva
[6:14:55] <%CommanderSqueaks> Tea is good, the hot water dissipates some of the THC.
[6:15:00] <%depressed_skeleton> @PeachSaliva Theres weed Bath water too
[6:15:05] <%Ell1ot> i think there's a spray too
[6:15:06] <%Sir_Gawain_Lotsson> @XeroSigmaPrime I was just doing the simpsons meme, I don't actually advocate ingesting substances other than food, medicine and water in any fashion
[6:15:06] <%TheDewdHole> @PeachSaliva They have low dosages. dont be intimidated, it's actually really easy to figure out what you prefer
[6:15:10] <+MoralCompassGaming> They don't like them very much. i make my own stuff
[6:15:11] <+SolverCODO> gamer girl weed bath water
[6:15:11] <RadicalWeegee> start small and with weed thats simple nothing hard
[6:15:17] <%depressed_skeleton> Make pat take a bath
[6:15:18] <%CommanderSqueaks> Pat needs sleep.
[6:15:19] <%Jekado> besides the sexins?
[6:15:20] <Monkeyweed21> All of this will help sleep
[6:15:22] <Dragon_Batman> Sounds like Cbd
[6:15:24] <%TheDewdHole> Then edibles
[6:15:25] <TwistedVerse> Siri, play Edibles - Snoop Dogg
[6:15:25] <%ShockzNDrawe> suffocate him with a pillow
[6:15:25] <%ssjklyco> Sex
[6:15:27] <%Naotox10> hot weed milk
[6:15:28] <%ThePuddingDead> alcohol
[6:15:28] <+SolverCODO> Magnesium
[6:15:28] <Zaphire_Saucypants> I use Tylenol PM liquid version
[6:15:29] <%TheDewdHole> That's what youre looking for
[6:15:30] <+RenoDeGeneric> Grab an Indica Cheeba Chew, these things are great
[6:15:30] <Dragon_Batman> Max uses it from time to time
[6:15:30] <%koriar> maybe CBD oil?
[6:15:31] <%RedMageRebel> oh wow only 40? I had ones that were 100mg I think I thought was a normal dose?
[6:15:33] <%rumtumtugnutz> CBD would help pat sleep
[6:15:34] <+MoralCompassGaming> He needs a nice indica
[6:15:36] <Monkeyweed21> Edibles are for sleep do yea
[6:15:37] <%TheDewdHole> Or tea
[6:15:38] <%Tenchi_G> Buy a brownie and eat a pinch
[6:15:41] <%XeroSigmaPrime> @Sir_Gawain_Lotsson OH lo, I was just thinking how the vape bans in the US would give Pat goblins
[6:15:42] <%Jekado> OG KUSH
[6:15:43] <+MoralCompassGaming> Blue Dream?
[6:15:45] <$curlym0nster> blue dream
[6:15:45] <%koriar> CBD helps me sleep and I have big sleep problems
[6:15:46] <%RedMageRebel> I am not a big weed man's, everyone just always smoked me up
[6:15:46] <%Jekado> afternoon delight?
[6:15:50] <%GabeSweetMan> CBD is the most common I see brought up.
[6:15:58] <%TheDewdHole> Indica
[6:16:01] <+DukeMoose> just go in the place and ASK
[6:16:03] <%ThePuddingDead> literally any of them will do that
[6:16:08] <$curlym0nster> edibles will make you GIGGLE
[6:16:08] <%koriar> CBD will definitely not make you giggle
[6:16:08] <Monkeyweed21> if you want both try little gummies
[6:16:13] <TwistedVerse> theres a weed called Clown Farts
[6:16:14] <TwistedVerse> do that one
[6:16:16] <corpsegoo> sleeping is difficult bullshit
[6:16:18] <%CommanderSqueaks> Have Pat ask.
[6:16:20] <+MoralCompassGaming> Yeah, the SQDC staff are well informed and they speak english too paige
[6:16:20] <$curlym0nster> edibles used to put me in 30 minutes laughing bouts
[6:16:21] <%Jekado> sleeping problems sounds like anxiety
[6:16:22] <%Sir_Gawain_Lotsson> @XeroSigmaPrime I feel like he'll have goblins no matter what
[6:16:23] <Neo_Kaiser> Paige doesn't speak Canadian.
[6:16:25] <%Ell1ot> you want Pat in a drug induced sleep so you can mess up the bed without him complaining
[6:16:25] <Slimeking_Mike> Whenever people talk about how complicated weed is my eyes glaze over ngl
[6:16:27] <RadicalWeegee> if you want some good stuff , ask for girl scout cookies
[6:16:32] <%SoFarFetched> Cheer100 Cheer100 Wanted to also add that thanks for the name drop of Pepper during your stream of mentioning furcon. When I saw him on the schedule thing I was like ,"Oh shit Paige mentioned this person,I should check them out" I enjoyed the performances he did on both days. Me and some friends thought he reminded us of Andy Dwyer with his band in Parks and Recs.
[6:16:33] <%Binary_Fireball> je suis mange la grand fromage chat
[6:16:33] <%CommanderSqueaks> Just have Pat ask.
[6:16:34] <%GabeSweetMan> I am so jealous of Burnie Burns' super power to drop into a heavy sleep at the drop of a hat.
[6:16:39] <%Naotox10> please help this tiny woman
[6:16:39] <%Jekado> don't you know someone who can go with you

[6:16:41] <%TheDewdHole> Paige honestly, with low dosages, anything will help Pat sleep

[6:23:46] <$Straylightgg> @Sir_Gawain_Lotsson I TRIED
[6:23:48] <%Jekado> Unsub sounds like a bad sandwich
[6:23:49] <$Straylightgg> I SURE TRIED
[6:23:51] <ninjaguiden> As someone who loves myths and strange religious stuff it hurt my soul when you talked about angels Paige
[6:23:56] <Arek_1> @Straylightgg Mmm, the phrasing never gets old. LUL
[6:23:57] <%Sir_Gawain_Lotsson> PAT DID TOO
[6:24:01] <$Sealion_Live> lillulLove
[6:24:04] <%Sir_Gawain_Lotsson> "COMPLETION POINTS"
[6:24:09] <%SoFarFetched> @Sealion_Live she streamed super long time. She started at 10pm EST
[6:24:20] <%CommanderSqueaks> @PeachSaliva Have you read One by One by Courier New, no shit my FAVORITE Undertale fanfic of all time. (SFW)
[6:24:20] <$Straylightgg> maybe it's the alcohol but that's the funniest
[6:24:23] <SiameseSneeze> @PeachSaliva I showed your stream to my sister a couple months ago and you're the only streamer she really likes, so thanks for that
[6:24:23] <TheArrow_> CLOUD IS SO HOT
[6:24:24] <TwinBat> Kreygasm
[6:24:28] <Zaphire_Saucypants> I can't WAIT!
[6:24:28] <TwistedVerse> cloud is so fuckin hot, dude
[6:24:29] <Dragon_Batman> Yea good for them making it look really good
[6:24:38] <TwistedVerse> dont fight it
[6:24:38] <%RedMageRebel> I'd date cloud and I don't even like 7
[6:24:38] <+MoralCompassGaming> Cool, sent her a message i'll send a whisper with her answers
[6:24:39] <%ThePuddingDead> Thunderheard hittin the town!
[6:24:40] <%Jekado> and cloud is tsundere in it even better
[6:24:43] <$GarbageNirvana> It's kind of disturbing how hot Cloud is honestly
[6:24:50] <Zaphire_Saucypants> "Pathetic"
[6:24:51] <%rumtumtugnutz> WELP. the best part about the being in Canada Texas is that I just ordered drugs over the internet
[6:24:52] <%SoFarFetched> give me them deets later.
[6:24:53] <%XeroSigmaPrime> I dunno if Id fuck Cloud in or out of the dress...
[6:24:55] <$Sealion_Live> It's 9:30am here in Jolly Old Britain so I was happily surprised to see you live when it's morning for me
[6:24:55] <%Sir_Gawain_Lotsson> Draft Mead is great
[6:25:07] <TwistedVerse> @XeroSigmaPrime both
[6:25:07] <SiameseSneeze> I'd let Cloud tongue my butthole
[6:25:07] <$Straylightgg> Cloud makes me think I might be straight after all
[6:25:08] <zamzoph> What if how hot Cloud is depends on how much of that whole sequence you complete successfully?
[6:25:10] <%TheDewdHole> and her gayness
[6:25:13] <Neo_Kaiser> Why are they adding so much to that scene?
[6:25:16] <%CommanderSqueaks> Peach, what's your favorite SFW Undertale fanfiction?
[6:25:19] <+DukeMoose> it's good to catch a live paige at least :)
[6:25:19] <Dragon_Batman> You'd fuck Cloud or let him fuck you?
[6:25:23] <%Ell1ot> i'm worried that they might not include Cloud in the Jacuzzi with the Big buff men
[6:25:28] <$Straylightgg> @Dragon_Batman yes
[6:25:30] <TwistedVerse> both
[6:25:32] <%GabeSweetMan> @Dragon_Batman *sweats*
[6:25:32] <%SoFarFetched> @PeachSaliva I Mean Paige we talked about Bowel movements with your friend Im still concerned about LUL
[6:25:34] <TheArrow_> @zamzoph that would be so good
[6:25:37] <%RedMageRebel> I'd give the SUCC
[6:25:38] <Dragon_Batman> @Straylightgg LUL nice

[6:26:23] <%RedMageRebel> its almost 5 am wth
[6:26:28] <$Sealion_Live> You brought up the closet pic of Pat on twitter a day or two ago. I have to ask, is that the only time Pat's done that or not @PeachSaliva ?
[6:26:30] <%SoFarFetched> It's only almost 1:30am here
[6:26:31] <%GabeSweetMan> Is it about a SKELETON?
[6:26:34] <Zaphire_Saucypants> go to beddie bye Paige.

[6:31:56] <%CommanderSqueaks> Weird Al doesn't count, too easy.
[6:31:57] <+Konquerer> that's not a band
[6:31:59] <+DukeMoose> Voyager is the same place!
[6:31:59] <%ssjklyco> Ninja Sex Party
[6:32:06] <%CommanderSqueaks> BESIDES HIM.
[6:32:11] <%SoFarFetched> @Naotox10 dude babymetal is so amazing live
[6:32:17] <%GabeSweetMan> BANNED
[6:32:18] <SiameseSneeze> HIM is a decent band
[6:32:19] <%rumtumtugnutz> Voyager is a scifi dumpster fire and I love every bit of it.
[6:32:20] <+DukeMoose> I cant be Isekai'd to Birmingham
[6:32:23] <%nofestu2> Yo i got to see Weird Al live last summer

[6:33:07] <%RedMageRebel> oh God wait I need to make pat and Paige npcs in my game
[6:33:08] <$GarbageNirvana> Just dump everything in CHA and everything else suffers for it
[6:33:08] <+Anonymasque> I must inform Weird Al of his banning...
[6:33:10] <heartlesshealer> max charisma for classmate friends
[6:33:19] <%SoFarFetched> @Naotox10 think when I went to their first concert,things were muffled for quite a few hours or so.I don't remember if it went on for the next couple of days LUL
[6:33:35] <TwistedVerse> Brain Age Paige
[6:33:38] <Zaphire_Saucypants> 2+2=Lesbian
[6:33:44] <%CommanderSqueaks> Oh so you mean Aqua from Konosuba?
[6:33:45] <heartlesshealer> Paige is the Deity of the RNG confirmed
[6:33:52] <TheArrow_> imagine praying to paige for wisdom and all you get back is nervous laughter
[6:33:53] <$Tredecian> never meet your deities
[6:33:54] <%Naotox10> @SoFarFetched I had balcony seats for their end of 2019 tour
[6:33:54] <%Ell1ot> Pray for the bad god to stay out of the way
[6:33:55] <%RedMageRebel> you must be the one I pray too cause I failed my math final like twice
[6:33:58] <%CommanderSqueaks> Peach is AQUA
[6:34:09] <%Binary_Fireball> what
[6:34:10] <+Anonymasque> You could only bring numbers related to 12
[6:34:11] <Zaphire_Saucypants> Japan is fuckin weird
[6:34:17] <+ThePayphone> jesus what time is it in quebec
[6:34:19] <Dhurkst> KFC CHICKEN FOR CHRISTMAS DINNER
[6:34:26] <terribleusername> Colonel Santa
[6:34:30] <Arek_1> Japan loves KFC and playing "Last Christmas" for Christmas.
[6:34:32] <%SoFarFetched> @Naotox10 I did general floorfor both,and they were both in like small concert areas.Not Big Stadiums but damn those tickets were cheap.
[6:34:33] <%ssjklyco> Kentucky Fried Christmas
[6:34:37] <TwistedVerse> kernal sandlers MingLee
[6:34:38] <CurrySauseBandit> Can comfirm.
[6:34:39] <%Ell1ot> is that why there's a KFC dating game?
[6:34:44] <%RedMageRebel> it's 4:35 up there, same time zone as east coast I think
[6:34:49] <%Naotox10> @SoFarFetched I ended up paying $100
[6:34:58] <+Flambage> @PeachSaliva Have you heard of the Colonel Sanders curse in japan?
[6:35:06] <%Jekado> 100 is worth it for baby metal tho
[6:35:09] <Aleate> I swear I saw a video on YT about that KFC thing. It was because some Japanese guy did a huge con on people to convince them that KFC was a delicacy at Christmas
[6:35:10] <Zaphire_Saucypants> I need to hear of this curse.
[6:35:10] <TwistedVerse> what happens
[6:35:13] <Zaphire_Saucypants> tell us
[6:35:15] <$GarbageNirvana> America has a shit-ton of revisionist history
[6:35:22] <%nofestu2> thats the curse
[6:35:23] <%CommanderSqueaks> The reason the grade was fucked is cause the German grading system was the reverse of the British grading system, so what the British thought was a D was actually an A or some dumb shit like that.
[6:35:23] <heartlesshealer> The Kurunel Curse?
[6:35:32] <%SoFarFetched> @Naotox10 not too bad for balcony I think,think general was like $40 or something for the first concert,then second one was slightly higher cause different venue that was abit bigger.
[6:35:33] <TwistedVerse> do they spit in your food and give you corona virus?
[6:35:36] <Dragon_Batman> Didn't know there was a thing
[6:35:43] <%Ell1ot> I thought you were giving Elmo a Lion haircut
[6:35:54] <+DukeMoose> she can now SMELMO
[6:35:55] <%RedMageRebel> nah it was just a marketing ploy from a manager since there's no Christmas culture in Japan
[6:36:05] <%Naotox10> @SoFarFetched i wasnt complaining cause the fuckin crowd went ham and i didnt want to be in that mess
[6:36:07] <+Flambage> In 1985 a Colonel sanders curse was tossed into the Dotonbori river cursing the team to never win till it is retrieved @PeachSaliva
[6:36:08] <$GarbageNirvana> It's probably his fault
[6:36:10] <%Sir_Gawain_Lotsson> it IS funnier to blame Pat
[6:36:15] <Slimeking_Mike> It's such a surprise Einstein got any work done at school, considering how many times the class would all give him standing ovations for dunking on the left
[6:36:23] <%XeroSigmaPrime> Semi-right, Einstein had often used different logical approaches to his math proofs than what was considered standard, earning him alot of ridicule
[6:36:28] <+Flambage> @PeachSaliva Colonel sanders statue*
[6:36:40] <%RedMageRebel> wasn't Einstein a massive dick hole to his wife and kids?
[6:36:40] <%MegboyManuel> MegboyManuel subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 14 months, currently on a 14 month streak! Jesus christ almighty Paige go to bed. Also could you ask my cute friend to stop choke slamming animals, he would go full Undertaker on Emlo. Love you Paige, please stream more
[6:36:40] <%SoFarFetched> @Naotox10 oh yeah that crowd goes NUTS,the last one I went to I saw a show fly in the air and someone lost their shoe. I was near that moshpit but thankfully in a nice safe place.
[6:36:43] <+Yukasmarvin> The Pat blame is strong in this one.
[6:36:43] <Zaphire_Saucypants> statue
[6:36:54] <%SoFarFetched> Shirt* not show LUL
[6:37:05] <heartlesshealer> Oh shit yeah, sports has hella superstitions all over the globe
[6:37:25] <Zaphire_Saucypants> You need sleep, woman.
[6:37:33] <%Ell1ot> i've never heard of that curse
[6:37:34] <Dhurkst> @RedMageRebel If entertainment media is any indication, there's plenty of Christmas culture in Japan.
[6:37:35] <juxtest> It was over 100 years
[6:37:40] <%Naotox10> @SoFarFetched mine had several crowd surfing that got too close to the girls, the fuckin pummeling in small groups, and looked like just a sweaty mess
[6:37:47] <%MegboyManuel> bless you
[6:37:48] <Ahk_90> Bless ya
[6:37:48] <%ThePuddingDead> gesundheit
[6:37:49] <Arek_1> Bless you.
[6:37:57] <%RedMageRebel> @dhurkst well now, this was back in the 70s or 80s I think
[6:37:58] <+Dr_Mooose> Elmo spores
[6:37:59] <+DukeMoose> @megboymanuel NO, chokeslam more animals
[6:38:06] <Dragon_Batman> Yeaaaaa
[6:38:08] <%XeroSigmaPrime> Einstein used an infinite series rather than a standard limit to define derivatives, which is extremely complicated but also very useful
[6:38:10] <Ion_Laser> THAT'S RIGHT JAY
[6:38:10] <TheWinged7> 5/7 perfect
[6:38:10] <%ssjklyco> meh
[6:38:12] <Dhurkst> @RedMageRebel Ah, okay
[6:38:12] <+Yukasmarvin> Fuck you, it's 2020!
[6:38:20] <%ssjklyco> doesn't have the same ring to it
[6:38:21] <%rumtumtugnutz> fuck you its goodbye tonight
[6:38:23] <TwistedVerse> fuck! it's 2020
[6:38:27] <%CommanderSqueaks> 2020 can only GET BETTER than it started.
[6:38:33] <MicrotonalMatt> Fuck you it’s forever!
[6:38:35] <+Konquerer> FUCK YOU IT'S FOREVER
[6:38:37] <TheWinged7> thats wrong
[6:38:41] <%SoFarFetched> @Naotox10 yeah the crowd surfing is always iffy LUL I always get worried about those. THose are definitely a sweaty mess though but thankfully the funk isn't horrrible.

[7:18:04] <+sirgoos> @CommanderSqueaks its almost impressive at this point
[7:18:06] <heartlesshealer> Do NOT throw Paige into The Witness, holy crap
[7:18:07] <%RedMageRebel> no for real that took a lot of courage to just say all that on stream peach, we appreciate the trust
[7:18:13] <%GabeSweetMan> The Witness would be meltdown central for Pat and Paige.
[7:18:19] <%Naotox10> it just makes the pull the plug shit worse
[7:18:31] <Slimeking_Mike> The Witness would be too mean. Like, I love it, but that is the WORST stream game
[7:18:43] <%NovraSplice> I hated the witness cos I never felt rewarded for doing the things
[7:18:45] <%CommanderSqueaks> @sirgoos Especially since it's FREE for them.
[7:18:51] <+Dr_Mooose> damn
[7:18:56] <nevan0> OOOOOOHHHHHHH
[7:19:10] <%Naotox10> YOUR BLIND
[7:19:11] <%CommanderSqueaks> Of course Peach, put on your bad glasses.
[7:19:12] <heartlesshealer> The Witness is more for intentional panic in paradise
[7:19:14] <Dhurkst> NOPE

[7:19:25] <Slimeking_Mike> Even if the person playing Witness is doing about as well as anyone else on their first time, the chat would go apopleptic at every puzzle.
[7:19:27] <%ShockzNDrawe> How the fuck did you manage for years on a prescription you GUESSED?!?

[7:23:05] <heartlesshealer> depends on if skeleton or not
[7:23:06] <Niney_Who> Paige is Semi-Final Girl
[7:23:07] <%TheDewdHole> Pat would die somewhere in the middle
[7:23:12] <PrettyThickandStrongDyck> I doubt it
[7:23:18] <%ShockzNDrawe> poking stick
[7:23:24] <%NovraSplice> If Paige was in Saw she'd be screaming BUT BABA the whole time
[7:23:25] <peachy996> Paige would either survive the whole movie or die horribly by accident
[7:23:27] <%Naotox10> You have the big fuck you stick
[7:23:28] <Niney_Who> @PeachSaliva You're the inexperienced planner
[7:23:28] <%CommanderSqueaks> But what if you had to solve a puzzle to survive, PEACH?
[7:23:28] <$Puhff> baseball bats in the walls
[7:23:30] <%Ell1ot> they would run around and accidentally kill everyone else
[7:23:35] <%ShockzNDrawe> You'd STILL run upstairs instead of out the front door
[7:23:37] <%SoFarFetched> @Naotox10 Is she Teddy Roosevelt?

[7:27:30] <TwistedVerse> furby deteced
[7:27:30] <@PlagueOfGripes> the real question is, when does monster girl quest paradox part 3 come out
[7:27:31] <%CommanderSqueaks> @RedMageRebel Boo.
[7:27:40] <+SiameseDuck> Take big water sippies
[7:27:43] <$GarbageNirvana> Every time Paige talks about her ass I can't help but think of Arschensetzer by Hell Orbs
[7:27:46] <%CommanderSqueaks> Drink your water paige. "PUT IT IN MA MOUTH!"
[7:27:53] <+sirgoos> bunny girl master fetish?
[7:27:58] <$GarbageNirvana> *Arschersetzer, excuse me

[7:28:08] <@PlagueOfGripes> you don't even know what I'm talking about
[7:28:17] <@PlagueOfGripes> fabricator
[7:28:17] <peachy996> Then the Crippler Cross Face
[7:28:19] <Zaphire_Saucypants> It's called N1RV Ann-A @CommanderSqueaks @RedMageRebel Not out yet here tho...
[7:28:21] <TwistedVerse> @PeachSaliva chokeslam poetry
[7:28:26] <$Puhff> Secondary
[7:28:27] <%MegboyManuel> My friend refuses to pick up animals
[7:28:31] <heartlesshealer> N1RV Ann-A is the upcoming game I was thinking about, if anyone is curious. Though I'd be interested in that fantasy coffee shop one somebody mentioned too 👀
[7:28:31] <$Tredecian> you should google it
[7:28:38] <%Straylightgg> ferociousHug
[7:28:44] <%MegboyManuel> and my theory is he wants to choke slam animals instinctually
[7:28:52] <%Ell1ot> dogs don't like hugs?
[7:28:53] <%GabeSweetMan> @PlagueOfGripes Grats on being #1 daily on Newgrounds today.
[7:28:53] <+theAncopro> my dog loves hugs
[7:28:54] <%SoFarFetched> @heartlesshealer there's another coffee one coming out called Necrobarista.
[7:28:56] <Zaphire_Saucypants> or maybe I'm wrong
[7:29:00] <%ShockzNDrawe> Pat is afraid of bodily fluids
[7:29:01] <%NovraSplice> inhale the emlo
[7:29:04] <%ShockzNDrawe> that aren't his own
[7:29:09] <%CommanderSqueaks> Cats are liquids.
[7:29:09] <%MegboyManuel> Pick up the cat you nerdazoid!
[7:29:11] <Dhurkst> yes
[7:29:12] <$GarbageNirvana> That's the same folks who made VA11 Hall-A ain't it
[7:29:14] <TheArrow_> my dog likes being thrown on the bed
[7:29:16] <TheWinged7> cats are non-newtonian
[7:29:18] <SGrim> @PeachSaliva I tried. Good luck with the rest of this. I gotta sleep.
[7:29:24] <%SoFarFetched> Paige is a Furry
[7:29:24] <heartlesshealer> @SoFarFetched Thank you! <3
[7:29:29] <$mckraven> chokeslams and hugs are only one shift in gravity away
[7:29:32] <TheWinged7> so Paige, what is your fursona?
[7:29:32] <%SoFarFetched> she confirmed her furriness
[7:29:35] <%rumtumtugnutz> let your freak flag fuck
[7:29:35] <+Snaketsu> pat secretly wants to protect the precious bodily fluids
[7:29:43] <%NovraSplice> yeye it's been wholesome and so chill
[7:29:49] <%MegboyManuel> A suplex and a hug are basically the same thing
[7:29:52] <%SoFarFetched> Yeah Paige is nice and she's a furry LUL
[7:29:53] <shieldecho> my cat just jumped up to join me and is purring so loudly, this cat NEVER purrs
[7:29:55] <%Naotox10> BITCH I GO FOR YOU

[7:30:12] <heartlesshealer> that's how it be
[7:30:18] <$GarbageNirvana> Furries are just happy you're giving them the time of day after years of systematic internet oppression
[7:30:19] <TheWinged7> as one of the furry subgroups, there are a handful of bad ones
[7:30:23] <%GabeSweetMan> Don't believe her lies @Naotox10
[7:30:23] <%ShockzNDrawe> The guys with the weird fetishes tend to be a lot more friendly than You'd expect
[7:30:30] <peachy996> @RedMageRebel Good luck
[7:30:38] <%Naotox10> @GabeSweetMan She lies so much
[7:30:38] <%SoFarFetched> THere's a touhou?
