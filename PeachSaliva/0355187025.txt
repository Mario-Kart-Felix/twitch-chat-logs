[0:00:12] <callsigneagle01> Maybe the Star Trek 09 reboot?
[0:00:16] <Yuntalenko> fucking christ i had completely fogotten about the mako, paige's gonna be the worst she's ever been
[0:00:25] <ShinobiPhoenix> I loved Jade Empire SO much
[0:00:29] <callsigneagle01> Don't insult Mako-chan
[0:00:32] <%BunkusFreskie> HERE WE GO
[0:00:33] <thelaxinator> Countdown to Paige being called a Quarian begins now!
[0:00:34] <callsigneagle01> it a good space AFV
[0:00:37] <violetheart> Yeee
[0:00:38] <%RedMageRebel> I will defend the Mako until my dying day, that shit was fun
[0:00:40] <snow_bush> Kaiden is better once you hit 3 than Ashley
[0:00:41] <@Calek> alright you nerds be good
[0:00:41] <Inked_Zandyne> oh yeah, as much as i love how organic the Mako is, hoo boy
[0:00:43] <violetheart> Let's go!
[0:00:44] <ShinobiPhoenix> I wish another company would just STEAL the idea and make it their own
[0:00:45] <%RedMageRebel> and fuck yes Jade Empire
[0:00:46] <Yuntalenko> oh i love the mako
[0:00:49] <Megapikman132> I'm super blind on Mass Effect, but I'm also pretty excited.
[0:00:54] <DXLelouch24> ok everyone lets make a pact that we allow Pat to do whatever it takes to make sure Ashley dies
[0:00:55] <+Reizie_Etherealm> @RedMageRebel I didn't know about Jade Empire until now
[0:00:56] <DXLelouch24> agreed?
[0:01:00] <AggsMK7> Mako controls for a Blaster Master game. That's free.
[0:01:03] <thelaxinator> Mako fun. Mako levels, ass.
[0:01:05] <NoctisxMog> I didn't mind Kaidan in 1
[0:01:06] <Inked_Zandyne> agreed
[0:01:07] <callsigneagle01> I can honestly get why people hate it though. For it being a good space IFV the actual gameplay was super stale
[0:01:12] <callsigneagle01> Not a lot of imagination to it
[0:01:15] <cadlingtongaming> Mass Effect 2's gameplay is tighter, but it's really important to experience Mass Effect 1.
[0:01:17] <@Calek> who's all ready for the hour of character customization
[0:01:21] <jijipose> Hype for the Sex Box Race for President
[0:01:24] <%kujofire990> @DXLelouch24 but pat would love Ashley...she's super space racist
[0:01:24] <Inked_Zandyne> me
[0:01:28] <%RedMageRebel> @Reizie_Etherealm it was Biowares first original idea before ME
[0:01:28] <Yuntalenko> mako-chan is just very tsundere
[0:01:32] <cole1114> I have several hundred hours in the original mass effect so this is gonna be fun
[0:01:33] <xeros720> i look forward to angry paige shephard
[0:01:36] <corepool> i can't wait for paige to make it look identical to her
[0:01:37] <+smoketrash> All girl sniper squad!
[0:01:38] <hawk_rush> Happy Holidays, gang!
[0:01:38] <snow_bush> @NoctisxMog Kaiden in 1 is basically Carth Onassi with a few changes. He diverergase later on.

[0:03:37] <%ShinobiPhoenix> also, I feel like Jade Empire was released incomplete. There's a WHOLE cardiinal direction of the map that you never go to and the game tells you about, but you never go, like itwas supposed to be DLC or something.

[0:20:14] <+BorinCorran> Sunshine was okay. But it's weakest between the 4 main 3D Mario's imo
[0:20:14] <%WheatlyXT> 222

[0:20:22] <KeystoneA1> @PeachSaliva Fun Mass Effect lore fact: Drell saliva causes hallucinations in humans. Kissing a Drell is basically like tripping balls on acid. This will make more sense when you get to ME2.

[0:22:42] <$Sphincter_Spelunker> Mass Effect 3 is nothing but online horde, how strange that there was no single player

[0:22:48] <%Bambaram> ME3 was fine until the last hour of the game.
[0:22:48] <ArtThouBored> @PlagueOfGripes ME2 stops at a great cliffhanger. What Arrival DLC?

[0:23:03] <Hibblesnicker> It starts out kinda slow but one of my faves @Peachsaliva

[1:22:30] <pistachio_the_nut> MALE SHEP BEST SHEP CANON SHEP
[1:22:30] <$Piemono> FemShep was better, not more popular

[1:22:31] <+stagemage> voice is better tho
[1:22:31] <+driemen> but not yet
[1:22:31] <Archmortal> Lady Shep has vastly superior voice acting. It's not even close
[1:22:32] <hatesdps> more popular with people that have taste
[1:22:32] <PumaOfDarkness> Lady Shepard just has the better voice actor.
[1:22:32] <@PlagueOfGripes> Jen Hale is more popular.
[1:22:33] <LixFury> quite the oposite

[1:22:45] <arcaderabbit48> So does Mass Effect ever hit the same absurdly high point of assholeishness that KOTOR and Dragon Age allow for? Like, how many sins against creation can we commit over the course of our space-faring journey?
[1:22:45] <$ooblagis> 82% of players used Male Shep in ME 3

[1:29:28] <corepool> he scremin
[1:29:29] <$Sphincter_Spelunker> I remember Carth. Kaiden is like the protagonist from Remember Me. Forgettable

[1:30:06] <PKFIORE> @peachsaliva would you stream dead by daylight? It sounds like you’d have a great time
[1:30:07] <+JoeStillLife> PEE PEE
[1:30:07] <%UncannyMatt> Kaiden is 110% better than Ashley
[1:30:08] <ArtThouBored> Lorewise Salarians are underrated
[1:30:08] <%AggsMK7> Space CIA

[1:30:14] <%RafflesiaA> Kaiden is Carth but you scrub most of the even vaguely interesting stuff away
[1:30:14] <@PlagueOfGripes> the collectors showed them how cutting edge it is

[1:30:14] <sparrrow_> Don't trust anything you can't fuck
[1:30:15] <+UltraConfused> Like 90% of humans in this game hate aliens
[1:30:15] <mr_slaide> SMELLMO
[1:30:17] <DemonicHoward> @deity_majora yeah but the Carth alignment chart is not based on VO its based on personality and Ashely is closer to carth
[1:30:17] <%jiin6> its baby
[1:30:18] <%ThatGuyfromMars> @Dapper_Cactuar uhhh there's a reason for that.
[1:30:21] <+Cinder5by5> It's a 10 year old game
[1:30:21] <Togamdiron> He's got the anime eyes.
[1:30:24] <+Axel6561> apatElmo
[1:30:26] <ArtThouBored> But I may be biased since they're my fav race
[1:30:27] <Russiandeathstroke> Woah, that texture mod is actually really cool
[1:30:27] <$HentaiSenpai9K> @rctiger0 GRANTED
[1:30:28] <valachi> @UncannyMatt Kaiden is mega garbage. His skills stink and his character is annoying though.
[1:30:28] <giogio346> @PeachSaliva GAME TOO QUIET
[1:30:29] <+DZiffer> His face is just tired
[1:30:31] <BrachyZoid> Still better than Andromeda
[1:30:31] <+CuttleCrow> yeah teach her the systems now
[1:30:34] <ArtThouBored> next to Turians and Krogan
[1:30:34] <ScreamingMeat> apatElmo
[1:30:35] <silvcrest> The collectors were a mistake
[1:30:35] <callsigneagle01> >we should have a skeleton run on a shakedown cruise on a ship with tons of new tech

[1:30:40] <callsigneagle01> lmao this dumbass
[1:30:40] <%krawtch> whats Remember Me? is it a game that I have purchased, played, finished and yet can't recall a single detail about, including the name of the main character?
[1:30:40] <AlasterAngelo> this looks so much better than Andromeda yeah

[1:30:40] <mr_slaide> He screms!
[1:30:41] <+Bluemanzee> Space racists are pretty justified in this game tbh. It's just that we look at it through too much of a human lens
[1:30:41] <bluescreen1988> baby cry
[1:30:42] <KaldorDraig0> Considering Kaiden’s not a massive space racist like Ashley, I chose him

[1:30:47] <Worldbrand> THE BABY
[1:30:48] <deity_majora> @DemonicHoward Carth whines non-stop. Kaiden whines non-stop. Good enough reason to dust him

[1:31:36] <+jon651> lol
[1:31:36] <valachi> @UncannyMatt He is, but he just doesn't hate space aliens. Ashley is objectively better because her space racism at least makes her memorable.
[1:31:37] <TheMaskedScrub> RACIST
[1:31:37] <+Sp3ctre48> SPACE RACIST
[1:31:37] <%The_Lady_Alustriel> the shoot bangs are god awful

[1:31:46] <True_swank> "My Grandfather fought in the first contact war. Fucking Xenos."
[1:31:48] <AlasterAngelo> IT WAS ONLY 30 YEARS FROM THE WORLD WAR WHERE ALL YOUR FRIENDS DIED JUST GET OVER IT
[1:31:49] <%jiin6> Turians can't Eat nuts
[1:31:50] <dekkitout> so theyre space hungary
[1:31:51] <%Bambaram> It really isn't compared to the Rachni Wars.
[1:31:51] <Fujiwara_92> SPACISM
[1:31:52] <ArtThouBored> Space Racism is there
[1:31:52] <%TheNeedlesD> humans are xenophones mostly

[1:31:54] <%ThatGuyfromMars> Pressley is fine
[1:31:54] <DeadlyJoker29> Spacist
[1:31:54] <%romanticzomedy> You will deffo see a space racist soon!
[1:31:56] <%TheSpiritof2277> No it's space-racism alright!
[1:31:57] <Zola390> It's not that simple, actually.
[1:31:57] <Zeemod155> Get used to humans being racists alot
[1:31:57] <$Piemono> Ashley is a huge space racist
[1:31:59] <%AggsMK7> Turians look down on humans mad hard
[1:31:59] <ArtThouBored> Oh just you wait
[1:31:59] <+Ilpala271> YOU SIR ARE A BLIGHT

[1:32:14] <ArtThouBored> There's one very special Space Racist waiting for you on the Citadel
[1:32:16] <%jiin6> don't be a dick to pressly
[1:32:16] <AlasterAngelo> racism against the moron aliens in this game is the objective correct choice
[1:32:16] <%UncannyMatt> @valachi as a character sure, but Kaiden doesn't give enough of a reason to be hated like her
[1:32:19] <lemonhead996> MILF
[1:32:20] <Dapper_Cactuar> @ThatGuyfromMars now that I think about it, all the ship's staff except Joker and maybe 1 other only really get 1 conversation in this game, and only slightly better in ME2

[1:38:51] <%ThatGuyfromMars> @BorinCorran I'm glad I'm not the only one who dislikes the Asari. They're either strippers or archeologists
[1:38:52] <$serpenttucker> I would not know, I was not there for the andromeda stream obviously.
[1:38:52] <Thenuclearwalrus> @LORDSPOOKLEKINS Luckily we're only at like the first 10 minutes of the game

[1:39:36] <True_swank> You are space Uncle Sam
[1:39:37] <%ThatGuyfromMars> @Dapper_Cactuar I like most of 3. The general hopeless vibe felt real but once I get to the Citadel DLC I turn off the game, it ends there. the ending is so bad and closes off any future sequel to Mass Effect
[1:39:37] <+UltraConfused> Nihlus is a bro
[1:39:40] <gustavozxd> THANKS TWITCH FOR THE NOTIFICATION I DIDN'T GET

[1:39:56] <%jiin6> SPACE RANGERS
[1:39:58] <+BorinCorran> @ThatGuyfromMars They have a massive smug attitude that got really grating. They were given every opportunity to succeed and wasted it. Plus the party members are all about as bland as Kaiden yet Liara is forced on you.
[1:39:58] <%NovaKnightmare> Space aids got them
[1:39:59] <OldManDeckardCain> poor Nihilus not knowing just how capable peach is Kappa

[1:40:16] <%AncelDeLambert> yeah, talk up the crab freaks more, that's not gonna come crashing down two games later
[1:40:19] <+BlackJack607> ANDROMEDA ISN'T THAT BAD
[1:40:19] <%ShinobiPhoenix> people keep trying to call the Spectre Jedi, but jedi aren't secret police assassins, that would be 00S
[1:40:20] <ECRead> i didn't hear the 2nd voice track for the Turian, but now it's the only thing I hear when he talks
[1:40:24] <%romanticzomedy> @Faustgesicht grey wardens ;_;7

[1:40:43] <%ThatGuyfromMars> @BorinCorran thank god they let you bang ACTUAL aliens in 2
[1:40:43] <The_Butterfly_Man> @HentaiSenpai9K rooThink
[1:40:44] <Stay_Knight> Andromeda is bad, accept it
[1:40:52] <callsigneagle01> Isn't Shepard like past 100 cause you can have some cell science refresh stuff that lets you live past 300?
[1:40:52] <@PlagueOfGripes> the idea of someone in their 20s gaining a position of any sort like that is laughable
[1:40:54] <+fFailureatlife> andromeda is lame
[1:40:55] <AlasterAngelo> I don't think anyone thinks Andromeda is good
[1:40:55] <ArtThouBored> Writing is boring tho
[1:40:56] <Clu_Flynn> Protheans invented cellphones lowcoPog lowcoPog lowcoPog lowcoPog
[1:40:59] <Virokwet> andromeda is disappointing
[1:41:00] <%ThatGuyfromMars> @BorinCorran Tali's face in 3 notwithstanding
[1:41:01] <%jiin6> @BlackJack607 mechanically i would agree, poor story
[1:41:02] <+BlackJack607> Maybe at the start but it's not anmore
[1:41:03] <%snow_bush> This will also be retconned
[1:41:06] <$Sphincter_Spelunker> Chris Redfield did it
[1:41:06] <$FrostMass22> Andromeda's characters look like inhuman abominations
[1:41:07] <+Sinetha> Plague PogChamp
[1:41:08] <%UncannyMatt> Everyone but the Protheans are dumb

[2:05:30] <ZakuDude> They throw so many gun mods at you in this game. it's overwhelming at times.
[2:05:30] <KeystoneA1> To be fair the game is pretty jank. It's not entirely Paige for once.
[2:05:31] <%mandragoraroot> boobs effect

[2:06:40] <+GimmMeUhSammich> Does Paige know that the weak spot is not the knee cap?
[2:06:40] <%ThePuddingDead> but this was your IDEA
[2:06:41] <Coystick> Arby listens
[2:06:41] <+BabyandShar> seriously, there's a big delay in between the shots fired, and the sound effect.
[2:06:41] <%snow_bush> MORE GUN
[2:06:42] <%romanticzomedy> no underestimate is a good thing? it means youre better than expected
[2:06:42] <bingobangoboingobongo> LISTEN AND THEN YOU CAN SEEEE
[2:06:42] <Togamdiron> First she shoots and then she sees.
[2:06:42] <+Sinister_Aglet> WHY DIDN'T WE LISTEN?!?
[2:06:42] <+unclekulikov> commercial break?
[2:06:42] <+Jimboq> :(

[2:06:46] <+chaumiester> No one listens.... Haha... Just like Marriage....
[2:06:47] <$y0_jimb0_> it's fine, that's why you're on casual mode
[2:06:47] <+CapnCarnivore> @PeachSaliva hey pat, DUSK playthrough when?
[2:06:47] <sparrrow_> the shooting is fine, it's the menus that's getting her
[2:06:48] <LordMoonIV> Pls don't change weapons EVERY time you loot
[2:06:51] <%mandragoraroot> i cannot vineSchut
[2:06:52] <+TheDude8D> if you want you can always go for the mage class, lot of less shooty
[2:06:53] <%jiin6> but its a new game, your not used to it
[2:06:54] <CookieCutter007> LIND
[2:06:54] <canadadan1991> just think all the aliens are women and youre playing at night time
[2:06:58] <PumaOfDarkness> My insides hurt watching this.
[2:06:59] <+Cinder5by5> You can't use Snipers
[2:06:59] <Darren716> Paige no
[2:06:59] <+Ryosuke91> omg this game is so cool
[2:07:00] <+InsaneJackLondon> BIG BLIND
[2:07:00] <Thenuclearwalrus> @PeachSaliva Always equip upgrades on Shepard first because the AI on Companions sucks and they do very little
[2:07:02] <foreverN2dust> Accuracy go down
[2:07:02] <DougintheTrench> YOU HAVE A SHOTGUN, THE THING DESIGNED FOR PEOPLE WITH NO EYES.
[2:07:03] <$y0_jimb0_> you could play by just spamming your squad powers
[2:07:06] <+Badgerconda_> Just run up and melee those fuckers. BIG AND STRONG.
[2:07:06] <$ooblagis> Give Sniper to Ashley, she's the only character that can use them
[2:07:06] <+Aleate> *30+ hours in* "Oooo, neat!"
[2:07:07] <+Reizie_Etherealm> Worst comes to worst then Pat can take the control and Paige can watch and tell Pat what choices to pick
[2:07:11] <+DZiffer> Wow, if you think about it Paige is just like Midir
[2:07:14] <low_hell_key> SO THIS IS WHY PAT WASN'T STREAMING
[2:07:16] <+CuttleCrow> untrained for sniper LUL
[2:07:16] <pibbleton> Paige is going to play through ME 1, 2, 3 Andromeda and the MMO.
[2:07:19] <low_hell_key> i was so confused
[2:07:19] <$ooblagis> Oh, wait, Garrus can too
[2:07:20] <+LumberjackJack> If you can't shoot, use the force
[2:07:20] <%dmdyne99> She shoots, then she sees
[2:07:21] <canadadan1991> kill her
[2:07:21] <hamiltin463> You have infinite ammo just unload
[2:07:23] <$Cavumentum> SHOOT HER
[2:07:23] <Fujiwara_92> MAKE PAT SHOOT AND PAIGE CHOOSE
[2:07:25] <MementoExtasis> everything in this game is good except the combat
[2:07:27] <MissMalisin> MAKE OUT
[2:07:28] <CastellanVon> SHOOT BOTH OF THEM
[2:07:29] <Alien3isTopTier> L E A R N <3 BITCH
[2:07:34] <+pleasenameyourcharacter> "Tell me another story about the @peachsaliva ." "Well, she got a chicken dinner once." "Fuck off, old man."

[2:58:57] <+yoshkosh20> DIN=SPACE RACIST.
[2:58:57] <AlasterAngelo> YOU LITTLE SHITS CAN'T EVEN HOLD A GUN
[2:58:58] <callsigneagle01> It always feels weird that every alien race just revolves around one fucken thing
[2:59:01] <Valdorick> That's because humans fucked the Turian's up. Little bitches.
[2:59:02] <+pleasenameyourcharacter> Because we can climb stairs, fucker...
[2:59:03] <+Sir_Gawain_Lotsson> UUF DA GA TEEH
[2:59:03] <+kiiiirsten> REBUKE THEE
[2:59:03] <alexandrecau> yes fuck you
[2:59:05] <$SparkAfterDark> This isn't really antisemitism. The race is literally based on the real history of jewish culture. Up to and including their poor treatment in every new society they attempted to integrate with throughout history
[2:59:06] <+Kiari13> do you guys think we'll get to see another planet before the stream ends
[2:59:09] <%Solidnick18> volus

[2:59:17] <callsigneagle01> Like this race is the war race, this is the money race, this is the science race
[2:59:19] <%MegboyManuel> Space Jew
[2:59:19] <alexandrecau> volus want more
[2:59:19] <KaldorDraig0> Asari can also fuck any species
[2:59:19] <%ThatGuyfromMars> @ArtThouBored it's because of their Solarian spec ops right
[2:59:21] <+BorinCorran> The Asari only get favored because the Protheans literally gave them everything. But it's shown in the series they are too arrogant and too stupid to do ANYTHING with their head start.
[2:59:25] <pizzapastamn> Fuck off Volus WE CAN ACTUALLY FIGHT
[2:59:25] <Zzross_the_savagezz> Salarian = Smart Race, Turian = Military Race, and Asari = Sex Race
[2:59:27] <+yoshkosh20> YOU SIR ARE A BLIGHT.
[2:59:31] <Stay_Knight> Yep, quote that video Pat.

[2:59:37] <Josef_Stryker> YOU HUMANS ARE ALL RACIST
[2:59:37] <Naho_Saenoki> The Elcor are the fucking BEST.
[2:59:37] <+TheDude8D> that's fine
[2:59:38] <Thenuclearwalrus> @PeachSaliva Turn on Aim assist
[2:59:38] <+dragoon001914> The Citadel Council is basically the EU.
[2:59:38] <OwlLightningMage> Paige is right to like the talking
[2:59:38] <%TheMilhouseExperience> And hacking
[2:59:38] <tmix1600> So are Din and Ash gonna fuck?
[2:59:39] <+ChaosVulpes> Us humans are so racist that we even hate each other over the stupidest shit! I love to hate stuff!!!
[2:59:39] <person181> sounds right
[2:59:39] <+Sinetha> The Asari are favored because they're super hot sex ladies
[2:59:40] <+Kiari13> gun only gets better as you go to 3
[2:59:40] <haisho> This game is good, the gun part is hard and the HACKING IS IMPOSSIBLE
[2:59:40] <+richardlikespies> yeah it's the worst part
[2:59:41] <%NWR_James> TELL EVERYONE
[2:59:41] <%Lion_kun> the gun part is not hard paige
[2:59:41] <Virokwet> everyone agrees
[2:59:41] <BunnyEmperor> hmmmph details about the money we ripped off the alliance doesnt matter
[2:59:41] <%Remery_> Elccor are cute Volus are Patlings
[2:59:42] <+Sp3ctre48> It's hard because it barely works
[2:59:42] <%MegboyManuel> The gun part is pretty bad in this game
[2:59:42] <takiyami> The gun part in general sucks you're not wrong
[2:59:42] <+Troispoint> Asari are Patreon girls race
[2:59:43] <Basch71> MORE GUN
[2:59:43] <mattskitchen67> your secret is safe
[2:59:43] <mrjohncarlton> Too bad the games become more and more gun part
[2:59:44] <%RaikenTB> But gun is good.
[2:59:45] <AlasterAngelo> The lore parts get worse and the gameplay gets better as the series go on
[2:59:45] <viewtifulr> gun part is hard because shoot game
[2:59:46] <$Sphincter_Spelunker> I love playing Volus in ME3 horde mode. It's tough
[2:59:46] <%ThatGuyfromMars> @Zzross_the_savagezz I'd argue Turians are a sex race too
[2:59:46] <%ThePuddingDead> AIM ASSIST YEAH HOLY SHIT
[2:59:46] <KaldorDraig0> Asari are sex and biotics
[2:59:46] <brambobelurkin> become gun
[2:59:47] <lloyddboy> DRAW YOUR GUN AND JUST START SHOOTING
[2:59:47] <sodium_station> TBH Mass Effect establishes nearly every race as being fucking incompetent except humans
[2:59:47] <C_game_me_811> You have more than the humans please doodHokey
[2:59:48] <ArtThouBored> An STG agent is basically the first spectre
[2:59:48] <+aClicheHipster> wonder how the mako part is gonna go
[2:59:48] <ScreamingMeat> That's Bioware
[2:59:49] <%CrematedCube> Story good, menu bad, guns okay
[2:59:49] <%UncannyMatt> Gun part is the worst part of Mass Effect
[2:59:49] <Clu_Flynn> Asari Sex Race is the most accurate description ever bldfHNG bldfHNG bldfHNG bldfHNG bldfHNG bldfHNG bldfHNG
[2:59:49] <xeros720> Might be a "Pat play and Paige make choices" game
[2:59:49] <CrabSlacks> I told my dog, they were disapointed in you
[2:59:50] <OwlLightningMage> This is the fun part
[2:59:50] <%TheNeedlesD> All 2.6K of us won't tell anyone, Paige.

[2:59:53] <sparrrow_> @PeachSaliva you're on easy mode so you don't really have to worry about armor and gear, just shoot
[2:59:54] <+CapnCarnivore> Asari can fuck any race of any gender. So yes, for Asari, scissoring gets you pregnaaaant @PeachSaliva
[2:59:54] <+comb711> Just wait till we get to the car part
[2:59:54] <+luke5464> Asari have mind sex

[3:01:29] <%Remery_> The Patlings!!!
[3:01:32] <callsigneagle01> Space Cops that watch over the space cash
[3:01:32] <+IMDRanged> Back when Mass Effect 1 was still an Xbox 360 exculsive
[3:01:33] <%Faustgesicht> tbis is not the shitshow that was andro.eda, dont worry
[3:01:34] <+Kiari13> wasn't there a citadel in kotor 2
[3:01:34] <%SuperCasualBoom> C-Section...Paige prego confirmed
[3:01:34] <pizzapastamn> C-Sec are crappy cops
[3:01:36] <C_game_me_811> Mass effect lore Kreygasm
[3:01:39] <mrgaster8> this is why where here for

[3:01:43] <SailingSaturn> oh man Anthem in less than 2 months LUL
[3:01:43] <+CapnCarnivore> @PeachSaliva fun fact, Asari can reproduce with any race of any gender. So yes, for Asari, scissoring gets you pregnaaaant
[3:01:46] <dekkitout> go earth, go!
[3:01:47] <+0range_> This the best part., listening to the lore without having to actually play it
[3:01:47] <%MegboyManuel> It's just like star trek with Plague
[3:01:48] <%generalve> LUL
[3:01:49] <callsigneagle01> cause humans are super scary

[3:01:57] <%Remery_> Pat's inner Volus is showing
[3:01:57] <+Fallout48> Pat Don't let her miss content in general
[3:01:58] <+aClicheHipster> humans are 20x better than volus confirmed
[3:01:58] <C_game_me_811> @sailingsaturn doodYelp
[3:01:58] <%ThatGuyfromMars> it's because humans whooped turian ass
[3:02:02] <sodium_station> Humans are the best, get fucked Volus
[3:02:04] <miguelrod777> HUMAN TOO STRONG
[3:02:04] <%maskedriderhero> Mass Effect not getting an Elcor party member will forever be a missed opportunity
[3:02:04] <ArtThouBored> I haven't played Mass Effect since the troubles so it's nice to revisit this stuff with someone's new eyes on it
[3:02:05] <%generalve> Yea fuck you volus !
[3:02:05] <BakedBam> HIT PAT AND PAIGE BUT HI TO PAT FIRST
[3:02:07] <Basch71> the chad humans
[3:02:08] <pizzapastamn> HUMANS SHOULD RUN SHIT
[3:02:08] <Darren716> Volus should have figured out aircraft carriers
[3:02:09] <$SparkAfterDark> If Asari can make children with any species... Does it have to be sapient life? Like, if you can't get a date but you really want kids... Is a cat fine too?
[3:02:13] <Clu_Flynn> nobody likes the Volus they complain about bad things that happened in the past to take advantage of people lowcoFace lowcoFace lowcoFace
[3:02:16] <+yoshkosh20> HUMANS= ASARI PETS
[3:02:16] <callsigneagle01> @ThatGuyfromMars NOOOO THAT WAS AN INCIDENT IT DOESN'T COUNT AAAAAAAAAAAA

[3:02:20] <%SuperCasualBoom> Human made the AIDS!!! That’s why!!!
[3:02:21] <+Sp3ctre48> Yeah cause they beat up the Turians
[3:02:23] <AlasterAngelo> Avina what is love?
[3:02:24] <dekkitout> because we are the only race with the wild dank shit that is the internet
[3:02:25] <+ChaosVulpes> Give humanity tribute or we'll fuck you up you stupid aliens!!!
[3:02:25] <Zzross_the_savagezz> Because every was super scared of humanity's military might
[3:02:25] <$ooblagis> You are aguing with a tourist brochure
[3:02:30] <callsigneagle01> @SnaKemuho I think we have like 5 tho
[3:02:30] <+VideoVillain20> At this point, all humans did was shoot at Turians...
[3:02:31] <cureneckbeard> asari + cat = catgirls
[3:02:31] <%MegboyManuel> @DRAGKUDO they are
[3:02:31] <+luke5464> That question just proved the Shepard doesn't understand robots

[3:02:36] <%romanticzomedy> @SparkAfterDark I think they have to be able to have some form of like. Actual... intelligence?
[3:02:36] <C_game_me_811> @dragkudo doodLewd
[3:02:38] <CastellanVon> Isn't like Medi-gel invented by humans? That's a big achievement
[3:02:39] <valachi> @SnaKemuho Give them like 40000 years and they'll get it
[3:02:39] <$JavaManJoJo> yo but can you bang this hologram?
[3:02:41] <%ThatGuyfromMars> @VideoVillain20 yeah but they did it really well
[3:02:43] <%RafflesiaA> @DRAGKUDO Unfortunately not
[3:02:46] <%MegboyManuel> Asari = Splatoon?
[3:02:49] <Valdorick> Alien Affirmative action - read - They might be able to kick our asses, so better butter them up before they go all TEC from SoaSE on us.
[3:02:52] <DRAGKUDO> oh doodGood
[3:02:53] <$lotharrio> I like this game, for being a clunky rpg. I'm sad that the mass public didn't agree with me.

[3:03:02] <+pleasenameyourcharacter> @castellanvon maybe that's one of the reasons they were given special treatment.

[3:04:50] <$SparkAfterDark> @romanticzomedy But how intelligent? Can they fuck dolphins and elephants? Those things got language and culture. What about dogs? They're pretty smart? What about just a really dumb guy? Or someone with brain damage? I've met people dumber than my cat. What are the restrictions on asari mating habits? Is it purely cultural or is it a mechanical limit. And if there is a limit, how did they discover it?
[3:04:51] <%TheMilhouseExperience> She lies!
[3:04:51] <$ooblagis> VI pretend to be smart, AI is smart

[3:06:14] <CastellanVon> I GO WHERE I WANT
[3:06:15] <Valdorick> Considering they fuck to spread their DNA, they likely only fuck things they believe will advance their genetic stalk. IE - They likely could fuck an elephant, but what civilization does an elephant have? Where can they get money or culture advances to woo other races... @SparkAfterDark

[3:08:42] <%romanticzomedy> ME1 NPCs were always so interesting. Even if you didn't like their attitude, they still were reasonable people. Well, some of em.
[3:08:44] <+evilpaul13> Is Saren friend?
[3:08:48] <%ShinobiPhoenix> and he is willing to see humans earn their potential instead of jsut be given it, jsut like Turians had to
[3:08:50] <OwlLightningMage> Absorbing lore is the most interesting part of ME
[3:08:52] <pizzapastamn> Saren is foe

[3:08:54] <$SparkAfterDark> Better a dirty job than an inside one
[3:08:55] <$ooblagis> Asari can breed with anything, because it's not really breeding, it's more like a Monster Rancher CD, where it's just random data into preset parameters. Asari's only use their partner for RNG, not DNA

[3:32:23] <sparrrow_> can't you turn off the camera shake?
[3:32:25] <+pleasenameyourcharacter> @callsigneagle01 They add some neat stuff, like a look at Quarians lives and some context to Cerberus VS Quarians, and Anderson + that one lady at Grissom Academy, but the wiki is a better use of time for that.
[3:32:26] <BourneWarrior> Ashley reads RedSpace daily and blames the Volus for everything

[3:33:35] <Valdorick> You get Ashley drenched if you just shoot all the xenos Kappa

[3:33:41] <%TheMilhouseExperience> So they have a plot importance?
[3:33:42] <sparrrow_> Basically no one knows how this technology works
[3:33:47] <+AXL808> that's pretty much the case

[3:39:57] <+pleasenameyourcharacter> @artthoubored Tali is very "girl next door." One of the only love stories that put a smile on my face.
[3:39:58] <+LogothX> HE HAS GETH IMPLANTS
[3:39:59] <+patricksly36> "RIGGED WITCH HUNT" - Saren
[3:39:59] <%SergeantSov> Man, that's a voice I'd go gay for right there.
[3:39:59] <%LordMoonIV> Fun Fact: Saren's character model was supposed to change slowly over time, adding Geth tech to him throughout the story
[3:40:01] <dekkitout> you are all bureaucratic idiots
[3:40:01] <$ooblagis> Anderson is actually super wrong and crazy here
[3:40:04] <+spaceroyaltea> Apparently there was a different character model for Saren where he didn't have geth tech until WAY later in the game.
[3:40:05] <Clu_Flynn> ITS ALL UDINA'S FAULT lowcoFace lowcoFace lowcoFace lowcoFace lowcoFace
[3:40:06] <OwlLightningMage> Earth sure ain't safe LUL

[3:40:09] <nolifegamin> Oh no not Earth
[3:40:09] <+Kiari13> i bought one of the books, haven't read it, are they actually good?
[3:40:13] <$Sphincter_Spelunker> @JittersCaffeine Later when you have literal recordings, they still take the same stance. You have to arm twist even then
[3:40:15] <+Aresius_> I agree Keith David
[3:40:18] <Da1TruPhoenix> keith david is a god
[3:40:19] <$RubberFistFight> the asari councillor is the worst by far. The turian at least can see reason, and the salarian is a fucking prick but at least they both take stances - not like the fucking blue coward.
[3:40:20] <+patriotrenegade> JUST SHOOT HIM
[3:40:21] <+Pat_Squared> Love that Anderson went full "He's trying to kill us all!"
[3:40:23] <$y0_jimb0_> to be fair they don't actually have any evidence yet, just hearsay
[3:40:23] <+dickbuttwoman> EXPOSE THOSE BALLS
[3:40:23] <+YO_DAMN_DADDY> doodStare
[3:40:24] <%ThatGuyfromMars> @ArtThouBored Garrus' romance is honestly one of the best written, if anything the most cheesiest. Most of the other characters can die so they don't put much into it, Tali's is delayed mostly because she doesn't show up until the midway point in 3
[3:40:24] <DraxTD> I ended up staring in Saints Row
[3:40:25] <+Anthony_the_Author> GARRUS :)
[3:40:26] <CerberusDriver> Pats balls exposed live on stream
[3:40:26] <+Enderborn18> Garrus PogChamp

[4:20:41] <$RubberFistFight> @PeachSaliva Paragon/Renegade isn't Good/Bad. It's more like "Considerate" vs "Ruthless" or "Pragmatic"

[4:20:53] <+JenovasPuppet> You're a loose cannon, Shepard!
[4:20:54] <Stay_Knight> You don't lose Paragon for going Renegade either
[4:20:54] <%ThatGuyfromMars> I dunno, in 3 you can be a real bastard
[4:20:55] <mrjohncarlton> "By the books" vs "Loose cannon cop"
[4:20:55] <%JingleBerryMan> Paige’s murder boner cannot be sated
[4:20:55] <Yuntalenko> one renegade decision doesn't doom you or anything man, chill
[4:20:55] <vexicbayn> THEN STAND BY YOUR DECISIONS

[4:21:10] <furtivestinbro> Sexy
[4:21:10] <cureneckbeard> lawful vs chaotic

[4:21:20] <Neo_Kaiser> Garrus's entire character arc is whether the renegade choice is good or not.
[4:21:21] <mrjohncarlton> Garrus wants to be hardcore but his mom won't let him
[4:21:21] <P1Hope> PARAGON IS LAWFUL, RENEGADE IS CHAOTIC
[4:21:21] <Stay_Knight> Garrus is a mix
[4:21:21] <Fawkes1989> Paige’s boner for garrus cannot be sated

[4:25:11] <Alien3isTopTier> BTW PAT- if she continues on the main quest this fast. She's cancelling out a bunch of side-quests, and totally could've convinced the general. She's just picking the wrong dialogue options because she's afraid of being mean to anyone. You should be using a guide while Paige plays the VIDEOgame.

[4:25:52] <$RubberFistFight> @Alien3isTopTier that;'s the worst fucking advice ever for a game like this. Guides for a bioware RPG completely dilute the experience and make it bland as fuck.

[4:26:36] <sodium_station> That's because Turians are dumb
[4:26:36] <+ArcanumMBD> Garrus calling Kaiden a bitch
[4:26:39] <$RubberFistFight> @Alien3isTopTier if she wants to choose the way she's choosing, and she's doing it because she doesn't want to be "mean" ingame, that's a totally valid way to play it. The whole point is to make your own decisions and OWN them.

[4:49:12] <%NovaKnightmare> Its not only that hes Goody Two shoes, hes also a fucking stick in the mud
[4:49:12] <mrjohncarlton> Ask Woolie his feelings on Carth
[4:49:12] <$DocMadfox> Alistair is Carth, but you can make him not Carth
[4:49:13] <Laecerelius> Alistair is the only good Carth
[4:49:13] <%mostundesired> LUL

[4:49:22] <%LordMoonIV> Alistair is best Carth
[4:49:23] <%Remery_> Alistar is a fun Carth tho
[4:49:24] <pibbleton> Kaiden is the most Paragon of all party members.
[4:49:25] <WanderingFlame7> SHOOT ASHLEY
[4:49:26] <konami2010> ASHLEY BEST WAIFU

[4:49:27] <%wizkid50000> YOU TWO SUCK
[4:49:28] <$Piemono> Bioware akways has a Carth.Kaiden and a Wrex?Black Whirlwind

[4:49:28] <Laecerelius> Alistair is great
[4:49:29] <CastellanVon> Alistair is the best Carth
[4:49:29] <ArtThouBored> But without the personality
[4:49:29] <SnaKemuho> Atton isn't Carth at all
[4:49:30] <+king_of_beggars> He's the male childhood friend.
[4:49:30] <+RedMaskBandit> theres none in inquistion
[4:49:30] <$TeraMercier> Atton at least has great voice acting

[5:16:27] <ASadFrog> @Scotaku People were just annoyed that there were literally three endings despite all the in-game choices. To be honest, from my point of view, the choices don't even matter for most of the game, let alone the ending
[5:16:29] <ArtThouBored> I'm gonna play ME3 MP once this stream is over.
[5:16:31] <%NWR_James> DAMN
[5:16:32] <rockworm> and the extended ending fixes a lot of the ending's problems

[5:16:41] <%jiin6> haha cause seth green is short
[5:16:41] <OwlLightningMage> The endings are also bad
[5:16:44] <+VideoVillain20> Why?
[5:16:44] <SGrim> @TheGershon it changes atomic mass. Usually made to make things lighter so they can be moved about easier.
[5:16:45] <Graywolf_the_45th> He was almost the voice too
[5:16:46] <booglesnurf> I will walk up to the enemy and then use my gun
[5:16:51] <ArtThouBored> Yeah it's super goofy when you see the behind the scenes of that garbage movie
[5:16:53] <a_mad_dragon> the extended ending just draws green shit all over one of the original endings
[5:16:57] <+grandmonkbun> And the voice before it got dubbed
[5:16:59] <$Sphincter_Spelunker> TOP IS GOOD, BOTTOM IS BAD
[5:17:01] <+Grayhammatter> why did i chose it?

[5:17:15] <Scotaku> The choices already felt resolved to me, the final stretch being the "this is how this story ends" moment at the end of it all. Your choices open up more options at that final moment.
[5:17:15] <Worldbrand> Just be a renegade then jeez

[5:17:43] <TheGershon> @SGrim Hmm, I don't think there's one that does specifically that
[5:17:45] <%jiin6> Paige is not VEGETA
[5:17:49] <mercado94> OH BOY I LIKE BLUE
[5:17:51] <Scotaku> But I'm a stupid shitlord with dumb opinions so... lol
[5:17:55] <alrobot2014> best ending for me3 is not choosing any of teh colors
[5:17:55] <Clu_Flynn> Paige is Gohan
[5:18:01] <TheGershon> There's one that makes things *soft*, but not lighter
[5:18:01] <OwlLightningMage> We've already established that Paige is Goku
[5:18:01] <Taipan20> ???????????
[5:18:06] <%ThePuddingDead> huh

[5:18:20] <alrobot2014> damned straight
[5:18:21] <ASadFrog> Isn't renegade Shepard MASSIVELY inconsistent morally, ethically, and politically?
[5:18:23] <Clu_Flynn> @owllightningmage she's chichi lowcoSip
[5:18:24] <%QueequegTheater> Goku was killed by a laser gun JUST LIKE PAIFE
[5:18:26] <+InsaneJackLondon> Pat is King Kai
[5:18:27] <ElenaManetta> PAIGE CANT ESCAPE
[5:18:28] <thedepreshun> Paige as Goku makes too much sense
[5:18:30] <SGrim> @TheGershon I think your referencing back to the Stand's idea, and I agree. I don't think there's a stand tied to atomic mass.
[5:18:33] <ArtThouBored> Paige would look though
[5:18:35] <ElenaManetta> IF PAT EVER HAS MASSIVE DIARRHEA
[5:18:38] <thedepreshun> Pat is Vegeta tho
[5:18:38] <DisneylandPimp> WHO shits in the Dark?
[5:18:38] <danknugglit> WHY
[5:18:39] <LulzorGG> plarp plap plap
[5:18:40] <Zaphire_Saucypants> let's ALLLL look at Pat as he shits his pants
[5:18:41] <+pleasenameyourcharacter> it's more that the endinga follow the "tell don't show" rule because how the fuck would you make a unique ending for every possible variation, so they had to generalize everything.
[5:18:43] <$TeraMercier> The actual, game tangible effect of most of the choices in all the Mass Effects is almost nothing. Mostly just which party member survives. The endings didn't change that pattern
[5:18:44] <$Sphincter_Spelunker> enjoy the poo stink
[5:18:49] <ScreamingMeat> Mood lighting for shitting
[5:18:49] <%Dino_Turtle> And then Paige takes the dark shower
[5:18:50] <+Grayhammatter> why poop in the dark?
[5:18:52] <thedepreshun> My Goku/Vegeta slash is canon
[5:18:52] <SnaKemuho> I didn't make peace between Geth and Quarrians to listen to the space kid bullshit about AI, the ending shit itself
[5:18:55] <%krawtch> if you shit in the dark, how do you know when you've wiped enough??
[5:18:56] <a_mad_dragon> pat is yajirobe
[5:18:56] <C_game_me_811> WutFace WutFace WutFace
[5:19:03] <LulzorGG> shit smell is worse when someone is showering. that's worse than a dutch oven
[5:19:09] <ASadFrog> @TeraMercier Pretty much this
[5:19:09] <mrjohncarlton> But renegade is fun, you can kill people while they are talking
[5:19:10] <+Finalknightmare> she didn't chose the renegade life
[5:19:15] <Virokwet> Pat eats ass
