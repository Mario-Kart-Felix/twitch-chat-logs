[0:36:49] <%Bluwizard21> ITS THE TEXTURE
[0:36:49] <+NiktenKing> texture
[0:36:49] <OneThousandTomatoes> i dislike chip dip texture
[0:36:50] <KeiganOfAstora> It's the heat

[0:36:52] <$rdark_ksu> salt is flavor
[0:36:52] <HaroldDonchee> salt is flavor
[0:36:53] <%AncelDeLambert> it's actually about the body

[0:37:03] <m1a_gunner> texture is just as important as flavor
[0:37:03] <+YourRedDog> The impatient folks are shouting "RELEASE THE 360 CUT" to Tim, like the high quality vid isn't going to be worth the wait.
[0:37:04] <SaiyanShoto> Who cares about texture when it’s the flavor that matters?

[0:48:46] <%lord_of_iron_kingdom> You're the best Pagie. also! I would to say Im so sorry aboutvwhen I subbed last! I was tired and sorry it was so unreadable lmfao
[0:48:48] <HaroldDonchee> plague is now jealous of the animals
[0:48:53] <+toolofparanoia> James Spader is in Stargate!
[0:49:04] <MyNameIsRasus> You are both [Number 1 Salesman1997]
[0:49:06] <+Mekhet09> You should play dangarompa V5 and make plague watch.
[0:49:10] <@PlagueOfGripes> I'm a farmer and you spend more time on that dumb dog than we ever did on entire herds of animals
[0:49:15] <OneThousandTomatoes> they'll destroy things
[0:49:17] <nipplestheenchilada96> don't do it, cat ownership is a trap
[0:49:20] <+polothegreatest> LUL
[0:49:26] <Armosis> get pet insurance that doesn't suck
[0:49:26] <%Sotetsu> @plagueofgripes LUL
[0:49:27] <$blazingsaddles_mongo> THATS A E TRUTH
[0:49:30] <+SenorCounter> Get a pet rock
[0:49:31] <%lord_of_iron_kingdom> LUL
[0:49:32] <+toolofparanoia> B I G C A T
[0:49:33] <KeiganOfAstora> they're not that expensive
[0:49:35] <OneThousandTomatoes> get one with stuff on ground level
[0:49:38] <jorniev> snake
[0:49:39] <MyNameIsRasus> Cats are enamored with boxes
[0:49:44] <%Ranryu692> pet insurance is great!
[0:49:45] <+YourRedDog> My dogs love boxes, this is a regular thing.
[0:49:45] <@PlagueOfGripes> don't have anything on a shelf you don't want broken
[0:49:46] <$blazingsaddles_mongo> that's no E Lie
[0:49:51] <+Dakuu75> I suggest, you scream a little everytime they bite, even though it's cute and doesn't hurt when they're tiny. Because it teaches them to not bite, later
[0:49:52] <%TheWinged7> hwck even a box ouline of tape on the floor works
[0:49:52] <%ItsRatman> dont leave your cat outside
[0:49:53] <KeiganOfAstora> Pet insurance is fucking expensive
[0:49:54] <%JoshManVGH> I got boxes for days, I can do that easy!
[0:49:54] <ohno778> Cats are low maintenance
[0:49:56] <Reclaimer087> lots of scratchers
[0:49:57] <CyborgAV> Tall cat trees placed next to a window so they can see outside is good
[0:50:00] <%Bluwizard21> cats eat wires attack you and shit and piss everywhere when they are angry out of spite
[0:50:04] <KeiganOfAstora> If they have issues I'll pay for it but insurance is a bit much
[0:50:04] <%GabeSweetMan> @PlagueOfGripes Fuck that's so true.
[0:50:06] <$milhousego> how old is Elmo?
[0:50:12] <+tempestzephyr> pat's tweeting
[0:50:16] <+RigmaroleHM> But so can the vet bills
[0:50:23] <%NigelSchnauzerpug> @milhousego 13
[0:50:24] <%GabeSweetMan> Cat's are assholes when it comes to shelves.
[0:50:28] <twistedj3ster> what about Pat insurance?
[0:50:28] <%ShogunNoonto> I can
[0:50:28] <%ShinSanitater> A lot of pet insurance will often deny you for big surgeries
[0:50:29] <Elky3> chariCRY
[0:50:29] <%Ne1son> 13 again
[0:50:33] <linSP> you had a good run cat

[0:50:35] <OneThousandTomatoes> old man
[0:50:36] <KeiganOfAstora> Thankfully my parents have a savings for emergencies like that
[0:50:37] <HaroldDonchee> get some mixed monster pet and you probably won't have to worry about the vet much
[0:50:37] <%Ranryu692> my pet insurance is paid for by the time I've paid for the heartworm medication for the year
[0:50:38] <+RigmaroleHM> 13 going on 13
[0:50:44] <%ShogunNoonto> I can confirm this my cat loves my Amazon packages

[1:16:48] <+Sullen_Walrus> this guy is the t1000 right?
[1:16:50] <generalve> @PeachSaliva man of medan only he is like "the host" of this series

[1:17:19] <@MistyMntns> Dyslexia Font yayayaya!
[1:17:20] <+Taisuru> Is that real or is pat making that up?
[1:17:22] <Dunmarkh> comic sans
[1:17:23] <@MistyMntns> Best Font
[1:17:23] <+wizkid94> !uptime
[1:17:23] <+NeonNobleKalzeria> comic sans
[1:17:23] <a_c_chirns> that sounds like Latin
[1:17:23] <$KeiganOfAstora> THAT'S COOL
[1:17:24] <Reveresao> wavy
[1:17:24] <OneThousandTomatoes> typography
[1:17:25] <%GabeSweetMan> I'm interested in seeing that.
[1:17:26] <LoliKappa> they give them more unique shapes probably
[1:17:26] <+Dakuu75> never heard of that font
[1:17:26] <+Buzzard42> Dyslexia Font is dope
[1:17:27] <%TheWinged7> comic sans
[1:17:27] <+Dives__> Comic Sans is a good dyslexia font
[1:17:29] <+Ynkubus_> Comic Sans or another foint
[1:17:33] <OneThousandTomatoes> typography is magic
[1:17:34] <%GabeSweetMan> Ooooooh
[1:17:34] <thesugardaddy111> it makes shit look weird
[1:17:36] <nipplestheenchilada96> i think i watched SGS play this, it is interesting
[1:17:37] <$SiameseSneeze> GROSS
[1:17:37] <SinnerEbru> oh shit O:
[1:17:38] <Djinnazz> eww
[1:17:39] <RushUnplugged> some fonts are more visible for dyslexic people, Comic Sans is ironically one of them
[1:17:40] <jorniev> COMICS SANS
[1:17:40] <$sekoshi> I love that even if it's ugly LOL
[1:17:40] <missingangle> Oh that's pretty nice
[1:17:42] <jorniev> SANS
[1:17:42] <a_c_chirns> just write it backwards Kappa
[1:17:43] <CatRidder> SANS
[1:17:43] <Dunmarkh> It's not
[1:17:44] <MoonlightWolves> Odd
[1:17:44] <+Grayhammatter> comic sans YEAH
[1:17:45] <twistedj3ster> it looks like PS2 JRPG fonts
[1:17:46] <Sowlith> comic sans and sans serif are good fonts for dyslexics
[1:17:46] <VAYETEAS> Looks like old PS2 text
[1:17:46] <%GabeSweetMan> I guess that makes sense.
[1:17:47] <@MistyMntns> I hate Comic Sans
[1:17:48] <%Sotetsu> I used comic sans when I taught for that reason
[1:17:48] <@SoFarFetched> is that why paige loves Sans Kappa
[1:17:48] <+CalderGaming> that's not comic sans
[1:17:48] <%TheWinged7> That is literaly  the point of comic sans
[1:17:48] <generalve> BIG TEST
[1:17:49] <thesugardaddy111> bro comic sans is the best tho
[1:17:49] <+Ynkubus_> Sans Forgetica would be cool too
[1:17:50] <+NeonNobleKalzeria> just about any Sans Serif font is great for dyslexia
[1:17:50] <jorniev> SANS UNDERTALE TEXT
[1:17:51] <%CopperTucker> big
[1:17:52] <MarylandJutsu> MAXIMUM SIZE
[1:17:55] <OneThousandTomatoes> i don't think it is universally, it depends on the person
[1:17:55] <SinnerEbru> it looks bigly like comic sand
[1:17:56] <+Dives__> SO BIG

[2:18:33] <%ItsRatman> Woah audio is getting fucky
[2:18:33] <Frostydough1> man this has potential but the characterization is SO weak
[2:18:36] <clockworkidiot> "the only dialouge we know how to write is arguing and bitching"
[2:18:40] <%GabeSweetMan> Are they all getting satan voice?
[2:18:41] <neroforte177> you guys are gonna die cuz yall cant pass a creative writing class
[2:18:42] <Sp3ctre48> Thank you Andrew
[2:18:43] <Yleciot> These guys handle pressure really good
[2:18:46] <tigerfang86> why does everyone suck
[2:18:56] <AtisutoCurry> lmao he looked at her as he said that
[2:18:57] <%g0atmeal> ???
[2:18:57] <BigFingerRo> Christ, these voices are so weird
[2:18:59] <+TungstenViper> "helping us find help" amazing writing
[2:19:05] <+Whiskey_T_Foxtrot> HE JUST SAID HOW
[2:19:07] <+cubbywolf> the fog is also a movie and a show and a book
[2:19:07] <%g0atmeal> localized fog?
[2:19:08] <ohno778> WHAT
[2:19:10] <+whyskeywolfe> [OBSESSED WITH THE BUS]

[2:19:12] <isolex_> john is such an asshat
[2:19:15] <ohno778> WHAT IS WITH YOU AND THE BUS?
[2:19:15] <%bassoontyphoon> These chucklefucks handle pressure worse then a landmine
[2:19:16] <%SuckerPunchSyd> ITS THE FOG WALL
[2:19:17] <%GabeSweetMan> Is it ironic or appropriate that such awful dialogue is coming from a class for creative writing??
[2:19:17] <+cubbywolf> B U S
[2:19:18] <Sp3ctre48> You literally just tried to walk back to the bus
[2:19:18] <vicar_anat> why don't you marry that bus if you love it so much?
[2:19:20] <+YourRedDog> Horror movie rules - most of the characters are flawed/unlikable so that they make mistakes that get them killed by whatever supernatural force is at work.
[2:19:21] <Laecerelius> Gotta get to the bus, the bus.
[2:19:24] <+transporterthesequel> the town LITERALLY says it's abandoned
[2:19:24] <+TombstoneTTromboners> WE CAN'T LEAVE THE BUSS
[2:19:26] <+greasypete00> because progression of story
[2:19:27] <DanThePumpkinman> Is the premise for this "learn how to write a good story. OR DIE"
[2:19:28] <Frostydough1> I WAS BORN IN THE BUS
[2:19:30] <isolex_> The bus is Kenny's boat from the walking dead
[2:19:30] <DrStinkers> she left her wallet on the bus
[2:19:31] <LoliKappa> everything has to be dramatic
[2:19:31] <eduwardovich> k bye lol
[2:19:31] <MarylandJutsu> Everyone is just ANGRY
[2:19:32] <Jetsfantasy> EMOTIONAL SUPPORT BUS
[2:19:32] <olm46> They need to argue, you guys
[2:19:32] <+SWFanatic> Among us
[2:19:33] <Lancaster_H> THE BUS IS PART OF THE FAMILY
[2:19:33] <jkfd> "THE COKE IS ON THE BUS"
[2:19:34] <ohno778> MUH BUSS
[2:19:34] <%ItsRatman> WHO\S GONNA HELP THE BUS
[2:19:34] <+alternative_flu> Bus is love Bus is life
[2:19:35] <+Genericho> daily reminder if you get lost to stay put and make yourself obvious
[2:19:35] <linSP> the bus is cool

[2:19:47] <+alternative_flu> It's a big bussy
[2:19:48] <+EyeFarted> She likes being choked
[2:19:49] <jowi_time> Probably because the bus represents house FIRE
[2:19:51] <isolex_> The bus is just Kenny's boat
[2:19:51] <LSether> Buss Master Extreme.
[2:19:52] <zhenthrim213> the bus choked me

[2:28:26] <missingangle> Here's how the writers could've avoided this:  get rid of that flashback entirely

[2:29:02] <ohno778> shut up kid
[2:29:03] <%g0atmeal> isn't there a triple?
[2:29:06] <eduwardovich> Can we not play darts?
[2:29:07] <+TungstenViper> this is a fucking tech demo
[2:29:08] <AtisutoCurry> LETS GOOOOOO
[2:29:08] <$cactus_gato> this game is at fucking jarring
[2:29:11] <%GabeSweetMan> That's it?
[2:29:14] <%JoshManVGH> it's a late 201x game, it NEEDS to have darts in it.
[2:29:22] <+Dakuu75> @PeachSaliva the game is SO DARK, is it suppose to be?
[2:29:26] <ohno778> random mini game
[2:29:28] <+cubbywolf> what a dumb point for a mini game. must be tutorial
[2:29:30] <generalve> they do actually
[2:29:32] <%king_wragles> They should honestly
[2:29:32] <$cactus_gato> Why was until dawn so good and everything after is bad
[2:29:38] <linSP> looking good joker
[2:29:41] <+Forbidden_Karp> kind of breaks the tone
[2:29:41] <+cubbywolf> must be a tutorial
[2:29:43] <tigerfang86> ??????
[2:29:47] <jowi_time> i beleive they did once
[2:29:49] <olaksi> @cactus_gato didn't the writers change?
[2:29:50] <AtisutoCurry> Paige proof
[2:29:53] <DanThePumpkinman> this is 100% a tutorial for shooting guns later
[2:29:53] <MyNameIsRasus> After Yakuza 7 and P5R that looked like babby shit
[2:29:55] <Laecerelius> Ichiban schooling those nerds
[2:29:59] <Lancaster_H> the dart would bounce off the wall and kill a character
[2:30:00] <BlindGato> Death by darts
[2:30:05] <+TombstoneTTromboners> "they don't play darts in the olympics" sounds like "this isn't a beach, this is a bathtub"
[2:30:09] <%optimasmaximas> @cactus_gato this is the only stuff theyve done since until dawn
[2:30:17] <scrumbotime> MAKE THE REINCARNATED SIBLINGS KISS

[2:30:33] <%SophiaAmoreaVeritas> Dismissive: Cut scene only
[2:30:40] <%ssjklyco> There's rational in the back
[2:30:40] <%skm742> so like... are they all so half developed because they're all manifestations of one person's impressions of other people, or is it just written super awkwardly?
[2:30:42] <+Taisuru> What does the lock mean exactly?
[2:30:45] <BackflipCharm> Taylor was nice to him at the start
[2:30:48] <+mostbrokenrobo> HE IS SECRET BOYFRIEND

[2:31:06] <+cubbywolf> I bet one matters
[2:31:06] <%JoshManVGH> Who would do this!?
[2:31:08] <+Kevlar_Caviar> @Monkeyweed21 yes, he got impaled on the fence
[2:31:09] <%SophiaAmoreaVeritas> John: Screw you Taylor, you filthy millenial. [Influence Gained]
[2:31:09] <%optimasmaximas> @Monkeyweed21 he fell on the fence lol
[2:31:10] <%CopperTucker> @Monkeyweed21 Yeah, he fell on the metal fence
[2:31:11] <TonberryLives> D:
[2:31:13] <missingangle> @skm742 This is just the genuinely awkward writing. I refuse to believe the bad writing's intentional

[2:31:46] <+cubbywolf> hmm
[2:32:03] <Monkeyweed21> @CopperTucker thanks forgot
[2:32:05] <%skm742> @missingangle Yeah, it does feel rough, but I don't remember the previous games being THIS bad.
[2:32:13] <+shootbang_exe> sure would be nice if these devs could make something as good as until dawn again
[2:32:14] <Lancaster_H> @optimasmaximas team evil hot vampire ladies
[2:32:16] <+Kevlar_Caviar> @missingangle believe me it gets worse
[2:32:21] <hitaker> alright...

[2:32:40] <%optimasmaximas> @Lancaster_H lady Dimitrescu Kreygasm
[2:32:40] <tuesti> @PeachSaliva is it okay to vaguely explain a gameplay mechanic that is awfully told to you (spoiler free)? its a thing i didn't realize until after i finished and i was like wtf
[2:32:41] <$RealThiele> yea these games are like 25% untill dawns in all aspects
[2:32:43] <+Whiskey_T_Foxtrot> cus he got that limp in 'nam

[2:34:09] <+Taisuru> LOOK AT THE CG MAN
[2:34:09] <+TimberWulfe> John, Dan and Andrew
[2:34:10] <+YourRedDog> A guy in there looks like Daniel
[2:34:11] <+Whiskey_T_Foxtrot> were those the player characters?
[2:34:13] <%SuckerPunchSyd> God i hate that flash shit

[2:34:19] <BigFingerRo> What is UP with these hands?
[2:34:23] <%SveriSageAdvice> they look like the others on the bus
[2:34:24] <+thebeargoesHONK> look at the photo harder
[2:34:25] <%slimmixrp> The ones on the right look like the cast
[2:34:26] <+RigmaroleHM> THE SHINING
[2:34:26] <%TheWinged7> thats a bad line
[2:34:27] <koffeemancer> daniel was in the picture
[2:34:27] <BigFingerRo> they look so weird and plastic-y?
[2:34:29] <KLouDraws> why does it look like the shapiro look alike was in the photo? lol
[2:34:29] <+transporterthesequel> Fourth guy on the right looks like Andrew

[2:34:33] <%Explodincatz> ALEX
[2:34:35] <DanThePumpkinman> darts scores
[2:34:35] <+YourRedDog> It's an Easter Egg for Man of Medan, that actor played the solider Charlie in the tutorial
[2:34:36] <BoxNavy> no
[2:34:38] <+cubbywolf> g h o o s t s
[2:34:44] <HaroldDonchee> you should probably beat them
[2:34:45] <%optimasmaximas> astrology is a red flag
[2:34:46] <Indigo_Automaton> COOL
[2:34:46] <ohno778> are your children evil?
[2:34:47] <%GabeSweetMan> ARE YOU CHILDREN GHOSTS?!

[2:34:50] <BisoromiBear> beat the demons out of them
[2:34:51] <+Grayhammatter> GHOSTS
[2:34:53] <+ghostfaceninja_> astrology = satanism got it
[2:34:53] <$RealThiele> bustin makes you feel good

[2:35:12] <Indigo_Automaton> \__/
[2:35:12] <%SveriSageAdvice> the two on the far right
[2:35:16] <+transporterthesequel> Andrew AND daniel, actually
[2:35:19] <+Taisuru> Blind
[2:35:21] <jowi_time> Second from the RIGHT
[2:35:23] <+TimberWulfe> and John
[2:35:23] <+Buff_Dev> the group of guys that are obviously photoshoped
[2:35:24] <+cubbywolf> fuxk it I guess
[2:35:27] <%bassoontyphoon> sipsipSipsipblind
[2:35:31] <%SophiaAmoreaVeritas> And the picture is held at the most awkward angle possible.

[2:35:37] <+Ynkubus_> Chick Tract when?
[2:35:48] <+Taisuru> psaBlind
[2:35:55] <Madovir> yo I'm starting to think this game sucks?
[2:35:57] <SpellCatty> I thought he was about to die
[2:36:00] <+cubbywolf> LUL
[2:36:03] <Indigo_Automaton> FOXDIE
[2:36:04] <jowi_time> i thought he was gonna croak
[2:36:14] <SpellCatty> FOXDIE
[2:36:16] <+cubbywolf> both
[2:36:17] <ohno778> he's the only black guy he's doomed
[2:36:17] <eduwardovich> This has strong Eddie puking in the toilet vibes...
[2:36:17] <+MightyDuckShoes> He felt a chill from the ghost nearby
[2:36:19] <MyNameIsRasus> FOX... DIE
[2:36:25] <+shootbang_exe> Andrew try not to talk challenge
[2:36:26] <+cubbywolf> FOX...................DIE
[2:36:29] <deviljhojho_> FUCK, NO
[2:36:29] <isolex_> this is so blatant it's laughable
[2:36:32] <deviljhojho_> THIS CANT BE
[2:36:34] <+Kevlar_Caviar> NOT EVEN HIDING IT
[2:36:34] <comicalmond> THINK AGAIN
[2:36:35] <+Taisuru> What even is this twist
[2:36:39] <Dr_Mooose> *gasp*
[2:36:39] <+cubbywolf> purgatory
[2:36:42] <+Grayhammatter> not even hiding it
[2:36:45] <+warlockwithapixie> WOW
[2:36:46] <+Dirty_Dandere> WAAAAAA
[2:36:47] <+harmonicarsenal> chibidokiFacepalm
[2:36:51] <Dhurkst> it's so comically obvious
[2:36:51] <+NDHCemployee> If they try to whip this out as a twist I'm gonna be pissed
[2:36:53] <%GabeSweetMan> There isn't going to be a secondary twist is there?
[2:36:54] <+Mr_Pylon> this isn't a twist, it's a flat line
[2:36:55] <CanadianAnimatorGuy> Just pretend the Sixth Sense never came out!
[2:36:57] <deviljhojho_> LOOK IT COULD STILL BE DEMONS OR SOMETHING
[2:37:01] <+transporterthesequel> Yeah this is pretty bad though
[2:37:04] <SaiyanShoto> Sometimes horror is just about how fun the ride is
[2:37:05] <+Taisuru> Pat this one doesn't even take being observant, it's JUST obvious
[2:37:10] <HaroldDonchee> so try to at least be a little subtle
[2:37:12] <+cubbywolf> doom music kicks in
[2:37:12] <AEnemyStandUser> is this game made by the people who did until dawn
[2:37:13] <AtisutoCurry> WHAT A TWIST- what whaddya mean its not the end yet
[2:37:14] <MyNameIsRasus> One of the biggest issues with Man of Medan was that it was obvious, and so they decided to make it EVEN MORE OBVIOUS
[2:37:14] <hitaker> who's farting
[2:37:15] <%g0atmeal> in this case pretty much anyone would get it
[2:37:17] <%GabeSweetMan> No make more fart noises. It's more entertaining.
[2:37:17] <+polothegreatest> Silent hilled
[2:37:17] <neroforte177> im holding out for a double twist like we're all in hell or some shit
[2:37:19] <ohno778> mouth farting
[2:37:22] <olaksi> fortunately bad horror has good potential to be funny
[2:37:23] <hitaker> whos talking whos farting
[2:37:24] <Indigo_Automaton> The trick is to then hide the horror behind the mundane
[2:37:29] <missingangle> If we didn't see these people in that flashback, we probably would be suspicious still, but it wouldn't be THIS obvious
[2:37:32] <+TungstenViper> this worse than bad, horror b movies have better plots and dialogue
[2:37:34] <+cubbywolf> dark souls time
[2:37:35] <Sp3ctre48> Tbf it's not even acting like this is a twist at this point
[2:37:36] <BackflipCharm> The grandfather clock from before the fire
[2:37:38] <isolex_> I wonder for whom the bell tolls.
[2:37:40] <+polothegreatest> psaHoldon
[2:37:43] <+transporterthesequel> SIRENS TIME FOR SILENT HILL
[2:37:43] <+cubbywolf> back outside?
[2:37:45] <%g0atmeal> why not stay the night?
[2:37:47] <+Dakuu75> @PeachSaliva omg, is this dead by daylight? Is the entitiy coming????
[2:37:49] <+shootbang_exe> this is really rough
[2:37:52] <%weapon000> it's the gong that summons Pyramid Head.
[2:37:56] <%TheWinged7> they need to move o
[2:38:06] <+Whiskey_T_Foxtrot> and you have to assume that the writers are competent, and so it then unintentionally comes across as patronizing, e.g. "do you GET IT, dumb player?"
[2:38:07] <ohno778> they're not even trying
[2:38:07] <eduwardovich> It was foretold by Gyromancy
[2:38:07] <%GabeSweetMan> They weren't in the right place.
[2:38:10] <CanadianAnimatorGuy> oh thank god a hint how else would we know
[2:38:14] <Sp3ctre48> He is a ghooost
[2:38:14] <Ackolt> Ghost darts

[2:56:59] <%g0atmeal> how could this random poster possibly be unrelated
[2:57:01] <olaksi> explain how??
[2:57:02] <ExpressNode> Holy shit its been almost 3 hours? I was fucking around in my settings since almost the beginning of the stream
[2:57:04] <+RigmaroleHM> They think it was actors
[2:57:09] <MyNameIsRasus> How would that explain it
[2:57:10] <+cubbywolf> Explained
[2:57:13] <scrumbotime> DOWN WITH THE DEVIL
[2:57:14] <%weapon000> it's a dress rehersal in the woods

[2:57:22] <%g0atmeal> actors? how frightening
[2:57:22] <CatRidder> acturs
[2:57:25] <%SveriSageAdvice> @PeachSaliva apparently depending on how long you were exposed to smoke, yes you can cough up blood
[2:57:26] <a_c_chirns> paid actors
[2:57:26] <+Grayhammatter> big acting, making you go back in time
[2:57:28] <%BogBodyPositive> in the woods???
[2:57:28] <Dunmarkh> That child was only pretending to speak an alien language
[2:57:29] <DanThePumpkinman> yeah that makes sense!

[2:57:35] <bob900000> <3 <3 <3 <3
[2:57:37] <%GabeSweetMan> This stream is the optimal way to experience this game. I wouldn't be having nearly as much fun playing this myself.
[2:57:37] <zetsubouman> god I thought it was monday
[2:57:43] <ammobasket> this is a reenactment of A Midsummer Night's Dream!
[2:57:44] <+Taisuru> First the irish, now actors!? Will the horror never cease!
[2:57:47] <%bassoontyphoon> When people suffocate it’s possible (not super common though) that the harsh coughing can cause enough trauma that blood can come out. Usually not leaking out like in the game though
[2:57:51] <whittacre> it's more than that
[2:57:52] <circular7> preggo again Paige? Kappa
[2:57:53] <%g0atmeal> what accent did those actors have? i couldn't understand them
[2:57:54] <+Tearonex> it's wednessday tho
[2:58:04] <%GabeSweetMan> I thought it was a day later all week last week. Thursday sucked when I realized it wasn't Friday yet.
[2:58:21] <Mattais88> Why didn't someone seak up about the town they're heading to being empty?
[2:58:21] <+Grayhammatter> trac door

[2:58:26] <jowi_time> @GabeSweetMan oof feels bad man
[2:58:28] <+Genericho> NFTractor
[2:58:29] <MaybeFalco> that road turns way too much in such a short distance
[2:58:36] <CatRidder> rain
[2:58:37] <a_c_chirns> it looks cool, dummy
[2:58:38] <HaroldDonchee> for spookiness
[2:58:40] <%SveriSageAdvice> to prevent ice accumulation
[2:58:42] <reginault> its to protect the strong part of the bridge
[2:58:43] <%AncelDeLambert> to keep the rain out, duh
[2:58:44] <+Taisuru> Protect the bridge itself from rotting in the rain
[2:58:44] <+Buff_Dev> so the road doesn't get wet
[2:58:44] <+Mr_Pylon> some kind of car hole
[2:58:44] <OneThousandTomatoes> rain
[2:58:44] <$RealThiele> water wrecks shit
[2:58:45] <@commanderclaw> I think they're neat
[2:58:45] <%GabeSweetMan> Ice
[2:58:46] <Psyramics> snow?
[2:58:46] <+realm_forge> To banish the ghosts, douse them with Guinness blessed by a catholic priest under a full moon
[2:58:49] <%AncelDeLambert> but yeah, it's structural
[2:58:50] <%GabeSweetMan> It's for ice and snow
[2:58:53] <+SWFanatic> And a river runs through it
[2:58:54] <+greasypete00> its the bridge from beetlejuice
[2:58:54] <TheHeroAppears> to cause tall trucks to crash
[2:58:54] <a_c_chirns> there's tons of covered bridges near where I live :)
[2:58:56] <Dunmarkh> what
[2:58:56] <%g0atmeal> no it's too heavy
[2:58:59] <%g0atmeal> LUL
[2:59:00] <isolex_> Pat, if they're made of wood, it's to keep rain off the bridge to stop it from warping.
[2:59:02] <+Kevlar_Caviar> ???
[2:59:04] <%SveriSageAdvice> bridges accumulate ice quicker than any other parts of the road, so you'd cover it to prevent rain from getting on it
[2:59:04] <MyNameIsRasus> LUL
[2:59:05] <$Kriptin> So you can get out of the rain?
[2:59:06] <ohno778> move the bridge?
[2:59:06] <+Grayhammatter> move the bridge, yes
[2:59:10] <+TimberWulfe> no taylor, it is a large structure. you can't move it
[2:59:11] <Djinnazz> move the bridge, you dumb idiot?

[3:47:11] <Profmcstevie> Ha
[3:47:20] <$RealThiele> Dinosaurs hate PC
[3:47:21] <+TimberWulfe> I thought P5 was already on PC
[3:47:21] <+cubbywolf> potates
[3:47:25] <+cvp5127> it will be vanilla p5
[3:47:26] <DianaTheAscian> it will take a decade at least
[3:47:27] <+DrFacilier> laughs in the year 2042
[3:47:31] <MidnightPacif1c> atlus.....
[3:47:48] <OneThousandTomatoes> p5 might be emulatable but not officially on pc
[3:47:49] <bob900000> imagine if they only port vinilla p5
[3:47:49] <DracaenaLeaf> oof
[3:47:51] <%VashyronM> @TimberWulfe Strikers is on PC, I believe
[3:47:52] <+cubbywolf> what type of language where those pilgrims speaking?
[3:47:58] <+Angelnickl> Did she beat it?
[3:48:02] <BoxNavy> yeah
[3:48:03] <%g0atmeal> ps5 patch would be good too
[3:48:04] <OneThousandTomatoes> yep
[3:48:06] <DracaenaLeaf> nope angel
[3:48:07] <+cvp5127> @bob900000 they did it for Catherine
[3:48:09] <$thomassolorio> its the bad game
[3:48:10] <%TheWinged7> seems like a college project
[3:48:11] <dashmatt> Oh not McGill?
[3:48:15] <+cubbywolf> are their games getting worse?
[3:48:21] <@PlagueOfGripes> paige gave up on that metaphor like the writers gave up on this game
[3:48:25] <Hilljoy> Yeah
[3:48:27] <$RealThiele> if you know history man of medan is instantly spoiled though
[3:48:29] <isolex_> @cubbywolf yes
[3:48:31] <Monkeyweed21> I bet that the ending is going to have a really awful message
[3:48:38] <+cubbywolf> LUL seems like they need alot of time to write a game
[3:48:41] <+Fooguwu> All of these characters talk nonsense constantly
[3:48:41] <%GabeSweetMan> At least there were stakes.
[3:48:48] <%strakillias> There wasn't a long discussion to break a window.
[3:48:49] <Dunmarkh> @cubbywolf telltale games 2.0
[3:48:50] <$thomassolorio> @PlagueOfGripes concise
[3:48:53] <+LadySaga_> yeah it's going very slow, hopefully it picks up
[3:48:54] <@SoFarFetched> SoFarFetched subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 27 months, currently on a 27 month streak! we at 27 months where back in my day's we had Vtuber Paige geefBlind Now in the OLDEN days we had Paige through her phone or laptop geefHypers looking forward when you start your Astral Projecting streams. geefPlz
[3:49:05] <+cubbywolf> man telltale really ruined that whole genre
[3:49:12] <+Angelnickl> Stacks low.
[3:49:28] <$SiameseSneeze> You got time to see the characters in their downtime and see more of who they are, here, they're in the shit immediately and no one is likable
[3:49:31] <Monkeyweed21> 12 minutes was better than this and thats a low bar
[3:49:40] <bob900000> the dialog is really weird
[3:49:46] <%GabeSweetMan> Until Dawn's script was fantastic because while most of the tropes are red herrings, there IS a legit explanation for all of the spooks.
[3:49:48] <+cubbywolf> I wonder if they remixed the scenes and put that one early to make the player understand more?
[3:49:54] <%Ell1ot> sun is down
[3:50:03] <%AncelDeLambert> wait, he's a LIBERAL ARTS professor???
[3:50:06] <$thomassolorio> id be disapointed in my students if they made this game
[3:50:10] <+Fooguwu> The fog effect
[3:50:13] <BoxNavy> noooo :)
[3:50:13] <mikesapartment> i like the scarf death
[3:50:17] <bob900000> the Irish
[3:50:18] <+cubbywolf> i knew that old lady was bad to tell the gun about
[3:50:19] <%SveriSageAdvice> it took up time and we got some good laughs?
[3:50:19] <vicar_anat> It's like poetry, they rhyme
[3:50:22] <+cubbywolf> thats the only thing i liked
[3:50:25] <+TimberWulfe> the accent are spot on...
[3:50:27] <Gorgs7> The child burned quickly
[3:50:28] <zzNamttamzz> It's funny
[3:50:29] <SaiyanShoto> It bad that’s all to it
[3:50:29] <OneThousandTomatoes> they tried to do the accent thing at least
[3:50:30] <Monkeyweed21> the Curator is cool
[3:50:30] <+TimberWulfe> *accents
[3:50:32] <RenniGlo> Yes the game is very pretty.
[3:50:33] <%SophiaAmoreaVeritas> The Curator
[3:50:33] <BisoromiBear> the weird fake language the past people speak
[3:50:36] <OneThousandTomatoes> tried
[3:50:36] <%GabeSweetMan> Is it ironic or poetic that this game is about a creative writing class?
[3:50:37] <%SveriSageAdvice> the game feels pretty rushed
[3:50:37] <Hilljoy> I don’t thank it looks good
[3:50:38] <RenniGlo> But the story is kind of poo poo
[3:50:39] <+cubbywolf> that was so fucking funny
[3:50:40] <LoliKappa> LUL
[3:50:41] <$thomassolorio> but the writing is poo poo
[3:50:41] <DjFrostBite95> LUL
[3:50:44] <bob900000> yup
[3:50:45] <+cvp5127> LUL
[3:50:45] <Monkeyweed21> THESE ALIEN ILLEGIBLE DIALECTS
[3:50:50] <%GabeSweetMan> ALIEN IRISH
[3:50:55] <+Mekhet09> if this was a parody it'd save it.
[3:50:56] <+cubbywolf> idk I can't place their accents to a country
[3:50:57] <%AncelDeLambert> the accents are just typical of NEW GODDAMN ENGLAND
[3:51:01] <+cubbywolf> english or irish idk
[3:51:01] <+polothegreatest> Just silent hilled them
[3:51:04] <%strakillias> I like the acting for the main people, even if their lines are terrible
[3:51:08] <$thomassolorio> the story id do do butt
[3:51:13] <%g0atmeal> the actors probably didn't know how silly it would be
[3:51:17] <$Tredecian> "I couldn't understand her feral grunting"
[3:51:21] <Djinnazz> The main characters are bso dry in their delivery
[3:51:22] <bob900000> i don't think they were trying to be funny
[3:51:27] <OneThousandTomatoes> i think it was supposed to be like pilgrim English, because they didn't have weird accents, but they didn't go wild enough
[3:51:27] <+polothegreatest> ye old engrish
[3:51:35] <+Fooguwu> "Filmed"
[3:51:43] <+mostbrokenrobo> Paige is saying it's not the actor's fault
[3:51:55] <$thomassolorio> that was almost better than the actual game
[3:51:58] <Monkeyweed21> they filmed the reactions to the  ghosts before deciding what the ghosts would even sound like
[3:52:00] <%lord_of_iron_kingdom> Irish confirmed to be unintelligible
[3:52:02] <Dunmarkh> you should.
[3:52:03] <%SophiaAmoreaVeritas> I get what you mean, Paige.
[3:52:05] <CatRidder> is the irish fault
[3:52:07] <@SoFarFetched> you shit RIGHT on them
[3:52:08] <%g0atmeal> for once we can actually blame the writers, this is just plain bad
[3:52:09] <+Angelnickl> So full playthrough?
[3:52:17] <+cubbywolf> it was delivered like it was written that he couldn't understand "ye old english". makes sense paige
[3:52:17] <%GabeSweetMan> Remember, everyone who's old and dead spoke English wrong. We're alive and therefore smarter.
[3:52:18] <+polothegreatest> Voice director fault
[3:52:19] <$thomassolorio> "shit noise"
[3:52:20] <LoliKappa> shit on the writers hard
[3:52:32] <+EyeFarted> You, being confused, IS THE WRITER'S FAULT
[3:52:38] <OneThousandTomatoes> ive heard some versions of a pilgrim accent that are very weird and almost hard to understand
[3:52:44] <Hilljoy> Yup
[3:53:08] <+cubbywolf> yeah, an Amish accent can be hard to understand
[3:53:09] <%weapon000> Cause little girl is evil
[3:53:22] <%GabeSweetMan> Orb Mousepad
[3:53:24] <OneThousandTomatoes> they just didn't lean enough into it
[3:53:31] <Dhurkst> That's not Amish
[3:53:35] <+RigmaroleHM> I had to have captions on for VVitch
[3:53:44] <$thomassolorio> bugabugabuga
[3:53:48] <Dhurkst> Pennsylvania Dutch has a completely different accent
[3:53:48] <+cubbywolf> they dont like electricity
[3:53:51] <$thomassolorio> there god is wrong
[3:53:51] <BoxNavy> whats up with em
[3:53:51] <+cubbywolf> idk
[3:53:52] <+Angelnickl> They aren't human.
[3:53:53] <%AncelDeLambert> they're special
[3:53:54] <Dunmarkh> Yes
[3:53:57] <%AncelDeLambert> fuck if I know
[3:53:59] <+cvp5127> Metaknights?
[3:54:04] <BisoromiBear> It's a spectrum
[3:54:04] <ohno778> they're weird tho
[3:54:05] <%AncelDeLambert> I still don't know why the Amish are Amish
[3:54:06] <@PlagueOfGripes> they can't own what they use
[3:54:07] <BoxNavy> yeah. yeah meta knight.
[3:54:08] <%SveriSageAdvice> Huh, I thought something was Amish
[3:54:08] <Dhurkst> Only Scwarzentruber Amish don't use electricity
[3:54:08] <LoliKappa> that's EXACTLY why you should shit-talk them
[3:54:08] <@PlagueOfGripes> so they mooch
[3:54:10] <+polothegreatest> good choese
[3:54:10] <+cubbywolf> ah menanights yeah they also have dresses they force upon
[3:54:11] <bob900000> metaknight?
[3:54:12] <+Mekhet09> That means they rejected their faith.
[3:54:12] <+crocboyz> what the kirby guy
[3:54:15] <@PlagueOfGripes> unless it's specific shit
[3:54:18] <+cubbywolf> so they are hippies?
[3:54:21] <viewtifulr> Thank you Plague
[3:54:21] <$KnivesEve> metaknight? like from kirby?
[3:54:31] <OneThousandTomatoes> omish are the og hipsters
[3:54:33] <$thomassolorio> so the village
[3:54:39] <Profmcstevie> You can steal anything
[3:54:43] <Dhurkst> Peter Santanello has great Youtube videos about them, very educational
[3:54:44] <Profmcstevie> *borrow*
[3:54:45] <+cubbywolf> communist religion
[3:54:46] <LoliKappa> you can't own that devil's lightning
[3:55:04] <+TimberWulfe> he did have a book
[3:55:05] <@PlagueOfGripes> mennonites are allowed to own stuff but it's specific and can't be ostentatious like black vehicles
[3:55:09] <%sleepy_coffee> sleepy_coffee subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 36 months! It has been three years in the pat dungeon, the light is blinding sipsipHellmo
[3:55:19] <@PlagueOfGripes> even the amish will use power tools but they aren't allowed to own them
[3:55:20] <+cubbywolf> gotta be humble
[3:55:20] <$thomassolorio> theres a big drug nd incest problem with them
[3:55:24] <neroforte177> @LoliKappa tbf we dont either
[3:55:42] <+cubbywolf> Amish send their children away to go crazy and then let them decide if the come back
[3:55:43] <%g0atmeal> because you can relate?
[3:55:44] <%octavian_wolf> meth
[3:55:46] <+Fooguwu> jenkem
[3:55:46] <BoxNavy> meth
[3:55:47] <@SoFarFetched> SMOKING CORN
[3:55:48] <$Bt_Robot> Is there anything that says "the Crucible?"
[3:55:48] <$thomassolorio> opium
[3:55:49] <neroforte177> oh sic
[3:55:50] <Hilljoy> Meth
[3:55:50] <+cubbywolf> i forget what it's called
[3:55:52] <$bravebravesrobin> all of them
[3:55:53] <Profmcstevie> whatever gets thrown into their field
[3:55:55] <Djinnazz> Opium
[3:55:55] <whittacre> rumspringa is they go out and binge on everything and then come back
[3:55:59] <+Mekhet09> Rural areas have meth.
[3:56:00] <LoliKappa> that amish jenkem be hittin hard
[3:56:00] <+cubbywolf> ?
[3:56:01] <BoxNavy> anyone can go get meth
[3:56:03] <+cubbywolf> rumspringa
[3:56:04] <+cubbywolf> thats it
[3:56:05] <$thomassolorio> ya but they sell it to
[3:56:07] <$KnivesEve> oh man they're taking winsect too seriously
[3:56:13] <%AncelDeLambert> rumspringa is NOT as wild as people pretend
[3:56:13] <$thomassolorio> like quilts
[3:56:17] <+cubbywolf> you can do w/e
[3:56:20] <$Tredecian> chemistry isnt electricity i guess
[3:56:20] <JobbedBone> god makes an exception for meth Kappa
[3:56:22] <+Deekman> Out here in Manitoba the huderites can be hard to understand. Very German
[3:56:23] <$Bt_Robot> @PatStaresAt Any books on Ergot poisoning?
[3:56:23] <+cubbywolf> ye
[3:56:26] <$thomassolorio> everything gose and dick
[3:56:26] <Dunmarkh> ye
[3:56:29] <+RigmaroleHM> I think so
[3:56:29] <+OrangeMDT> Paige, people can break rules
[3:56:30] <LORDSPOOKLEKINS> ye
[3:56:30] <Djinnazz> Well if you're ON meth i don't think you care at that point.
[3:56:31] <$Tredecian> yea
[3:56:31] <%AncelDeLambert> a lot of times the "outside world" that they're allowed in rumspringa is OTHER Amish families
[3:56:35] <Hilljoy> Yes
[3:56:36] <+cubbywolf> idk about gay stuff, i'd be interested to know
[3:56:38] <+realm_forge> Addicts don’t really care about religion
[3:56:39] <+cubbywolf> if that's accepted
[3:56:44] <+cubbywolf> yeah and you can decide to not come back too
[3:56:46] <@Jekado> i think thats the point isnt it?
[3:56:46] <%AncelDeLambert> the answer is "it depends"
[3:56:51] <+Mekhet09> It's a once in a lifetime thing.
[3:56:55] <whittacre> the point is to see the outside world and decide if you want ot go back or not
[3:56:56] <Dunmarkh> Didn't jesus die so you could do that?
[3:57:02] <$thomassolorio> you dont even have to come back
[3:57:03] <Hilljoy> A lot do
[3:57:07] <$Tredecian> its kinda a false choice
[3:57:11] <+cubbywolf> spoopy book?
[3:57:13] <overlord_nico> Dow their oats
[3:57:13] <+Mekhet09> Most of which turn out to be bad experiences because they basically taken to bad areas.
[3:57:16] <%AncelDeLambert> except a lot of the times the outside world isn't outside
[3:57:16] <+mostbrokenrobo> i think the intent is to overload their brain with new experiences to fear them into returning to a simple life
[3:57:21] <+TimberWulfe> Enhance it, Pat!
[3:57:25] <+TimberWulfe> ENHANCE!
[3:57:33] <$thomassolorio> oat fucking
[3:57:35] <$Bt_Robot> There's a story of a girl who went to Vegas and became a prostitute for a while
[3:57:37] <+cubbywolf> @Tredecian true, they try to make them return through manipulation
[3:57:43] <JobbedBone> "gorilla mindset" oh no
[3:57:51] <$Bt_Robot> Enhance Pat
