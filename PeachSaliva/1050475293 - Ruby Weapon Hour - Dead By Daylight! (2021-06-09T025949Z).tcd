[0:38:34] <tanarath> PAIGE
[0:38:35] <%chance_h> first try baby!
[0:38:37] <%Roasted_Pheasant> "I am not a good player" - Paige 2021
[0:38:37] <Ziegsy> She needs an elmo vtuber model. so even when shes feeling bad she can still hide and keep the elmo
[0:38:38] <$JoshManVGH> I don't think the vodka helped!
[0:38:39] <@SoFarFetched> You had the right idea but you were late on the timing geefLul
[0:38:42] <$cade_calrayn> took it right to the face
[0:38:42] <+illiad> First game plays
[0:38:42] <$AzureGale> Got hooked LIKE A BOSS
[0:38:42] <MayorRev> paige you sound drunk already
[0:38:44] <+illiad> RUDE
[0:38:45] <Profmcstevie> bleeding out like a QUEEN
[0:38:55] <$AzureGale> Wow this killer SUCKS
[0:38:56] <Madovir> her powerful jawline has so much room for shit
[0:39:01] <missingangle> Getting sacrified like a KING
[0:39:03] <rearedlogarithm> Elmo how could you just sit there and let that happen.
[0:39:03] <augusta_wind> boooo
[0:39:03] <+InhumanMilitia> so glad they changed struggle
[0:39:08] <+ArsCaelia> ...how is she not dead lol
[0:39:10] <+barristerofthebar> Camper no camping
[0:39:11] <MayorRev> whats tunnelling
[0:39:21] <Psyramics> tunnel visioning on one person
[0:39:22] <%MarylandJutsu> request for this billy to be sent to the shadowrealm
[0:39:32] <$TheNewZealandStory> he's not being a turd your teammates wont lead him away
[0:39:33] <skyentombment> Thank you for rescue
[0:39:35] <@SoFarFetched> yeah paige meant camping which is the killer stays by the hook and never leaves.
[0:39:40] <hisyam970302> HOW WAS SHE STILL ALIVE ON THAT HOOK LMAO
[0:39:41] <$AzureGale> Block this killer
[0:39:42] <RyuuAoi> Take a shot every time you get strung up @peachsaliva you'll git gud
[0:39:50] <%MarylandJutsu> ohyoure wearing the pride pin too
[0:39:55] <+doc_ock_rokc> IF paige was a Survivor she would have a perk that is "AND TAKE IT" where you can tank one shot after a repair by standing still
[0:40:03] <missingangle> Take a shot every time Paige swears out of stress.
[0:40:06] <RyuuAoi> TCM
[0:40:11] <DrkJP520> sup, nerds
[0:40:12] <%MarylandJutsu> I also hate him
[0:40:14] <+Mendin> Camping is mechanically disinclined by penalizing the Killer points if he hangs around a hooked person too long, but A Kill Is A Kill
[0:40:14] <+doc_ock_rokc> @PeachSaliva you can blind killers while they hang a survivor
[0:40:17] <$Sphincter_Spelunker> see this hook? this is my favorite hook
[0:40:21] <Psyramics> he's not gonna chase if you go to far, exploit that
[0:40:23] <skyentombment> WHAAAA
[0:40:24] <tanarath> paige...
[0:40:28] <%Trenr> paige pls
[0:40:29] <$TheNewZealandStory> that is not proper flashlight use
[0:40:29] <@SoFarFetched> @doc_ock_rokc that would require her to first practice the aim geefO
[0:40:38] <MayorRev> get eli on the horn
[0:40:39] <Zeif00> prolly should have healed up oh well
[0:40:41] <$AzureGale> I hope this killer steps on LEGO bricks for all eternity
[0:40:41] <%MarylandJutsu> I mean eli isn't wrong
[0:40:45] <Ziegsy> tetanus. the true killer
[0:40:47] <+Mendin> balls all up in her ass
[0:40:50] <+doc_ock_rokc> THIS guy is MVP
[0:40:56] <MayorRev> have eli hop on
[0:41:13] <augusta_wind> these noises are so much
[0:41:13] <Ziegsy> quick back massage
[0:41:14] <+Mendin> I  mean the billy did slug her and walk off instead of going for a second hook this fast so Honour Points for that I guess
[0:41:16] <@SoFarFetched> Paige is planning to solo tonight.
[0:41:18] <RyuuAoi> Don't listen to Plague. He is a farmer. Ha
[0:41:19] <skyentombment> scratching his back
[0:41:26] <$TheNewZealandStory> these survivors would be my dream as killer
[0:41:29] <+doc_ock_rokc> I try to anti Tunnel
[0:41:31] <%MarylandJutsu> objectives?
[0:41:32] <skyentombment> one of those
[0:41:37] <tanarath> ONE DRINK
[0:41:42] <$Sphincter_Spelunker> what a lush
[0:41:42] <@SoFarFetched> Objectives = do generators
[0:41:44] <Ziegsy> grooming each other like chimps. tasty bug snack time
[0:41:47] <$AzureGale> Paige going to go get some objections like Phoenix Wright
[0:41:53] <+ThatGuyfromMars> a single sip of alcohol sends paige over the edge
[0:42:02] <+InhumanMilitia> one drink= fish bowl margarita
[0:42:02] <+illiad> theres  always a gen 2nd floor of the main building
[0:42:02] <$Sphincter_Spelunker> don't call us Shirley
[0:42:06] <20zachariah16> Don‚Äôt get jumpy on me now
[0:42:14] <+doc_ock_rokc> @PeachSaliva your alcohol tolerance becomes less if you do not drink often
[0:42:40] <%MarylandJutsu> mmmmm toast
[0:42:44] <@SoFarFetched> Remember paige: first match doesn't count cause its the practice one
[0:42:46] <@SoFarFetched> Kappa
[0:42:47] <+doc_ock_rokc> POST THIS ON THE INTERNET
[0:42:47] <RyuuAoi> Peach, when making your cocktails, do you do the five count pour? That's the best.
[0:43:00] <%MarylandJutsu> also this guy was tunneling
[0:43:01] <Ziegsy> First match, like the first pancake, is a throw away
[0:43:03] <%MarylandJutsu> he's being rude
[0:43:06] <+doc_ock_rokc> The fucker is still tunniling
[0:43:15] <@SoFarFetched> about
[0:43:18] <$GarbageNirvana> How do I keep missing these going live
[0:43:19] <+doc_ock_rokc> he is coming closer
[0:43:19] <Zeif00> 80 seconds I think?
[0:43:31] <+InhumanMilitia> 1:20
[0:43:46] <+ArsCaelia> oo that was a fun noise
[0:44:00] <Ziegsy> the distant screams are delightful
[0:44:03] <skyentombment> Yo, you guys ever read that thing where some dude got inhumanly salty because his fiancee was super good at dbd, and kept saying all this shit about how she got something he struggled for super easily
[0:44:03] <+Das_Prints> It takes 80 seconds I think.
[0:44:15] <+doc_ock_rokc> This fucker
[0:44:25] <%MarylandJutsu> wow this guy is f***ing rude
[0:44:27] <+doc_ock_rokc> I hope he gets enity displeased
[0:44:32] <Ziegsy> So, chat, what does the game do to stop the survivors from juat hiding ?
[0:44:36] <+SharpClaw_> why have fun if you can camp
[0:44:37] <+Mendin> Crows
[0:44:49] <%MarylandJutsu> @Ziegsy you can't leave and the killer will find you eventually
[0:44:52] <+DinnerCalzone> There are crows that spawn after a while that give away your location
[0:44:53] <%Roasted_Pheasant> Murder us all you want, just don't be mean.
[0:45:03] <RyuuAoi> It's a trap!
[0:45:06] <@SoFarFetched> @Ziegsy if the survivors do nothing but hide for a good while without doing objectives,crows will start appearing on their head and making a noise to alert the killer.
[0:45:08] <$TheNewZealandStory> i dont think its camping if you're blatantly trying to go for an unhook in front of the killer
[0:45:10] <Dementedpenguin> @Ziegsy like, standing still? Crows mark your location after some time
[0:45:11] <Ziegsy> @marylandjutsu @dinnercalzone thank you!
[0:45:11] <+Mendin> Crows will circle over people idling and if you're idfle way too long they'll just start crawking to alert the killer definitively
[0:45:28] <Ziegsy> thats evil. i love it
[0:45:37] <$Sphincter_Spelunker> @TheNewZealandStory he was attacking people while they were hooked
[0:45:40] <FallenAngelZelos> FallenAngelZelos subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 4 months! *finger guns*
[0:45:43] <+InhumanMilitia> time to find hatch\
[0:45:45] <RetributionP> a winner is murder
[0:45:45] <Profmcstevie> Becoming very familiar with the floor I see
[0:45:46] <perpetualpotionmachine> waynerSob
[0:45:50] <$TheNewZealandStory> @Sphincter_Spelunker they deserved it for being bad
[0:45:56] <+doc_ock_rokc> HELLO GROUND
[0:45:56] <@SoFarFetched> It was more the killer stuck around after hooking
[0:45:57] <%TheZearGuy> Just warming up
[0:46:05] <@SoFarFetched> cause you hook then go look for other survivors
[0:46:07] <$Sphincter_Spelunker> yikes dude, I don't even play DBD
[0:46:13] <%MarylandJutsu> @TheNewZealandStory he kept around the hook for mulitple minutes
[0:46:19] <RyuuAoi> It's alright! First round never counts.
[0:46:21] <+doc_ock_rokc> this guy is a bitch
[0:46:39] <+doc_ock_rokc> We got enough gens
[0:46:41] <%samTUMZfestival> It's okay, you can be angry.
[0:46:45] <$TheNewZealandStory> @MarylandJutsu because people were obviously trying to go for the unhook in front of him
[0:46:47] <+Mendin> DBD, much like League. has an astounding ability to induce salty bitterness in everyone involved
[0:46:52] <Ziegsy> wouldnt hook camping be a bad strat? the others can gen if you wont leave the hook right?
[0:47:11] <$TheNewZealandStory> @Ziegsy yes but at this rank people dont do gens
[0:47:16] <%samTUMZfestival> That animation... I'm just saying put someone in front of her
[0:47:16] <+Mendin> Generally yes unless you're going for a specific objective that requires a kill
[0:47:20] <@SoFarFetched> yeah pretty much,if you stay near hook. Just means the survivors can continue their objectives without getting bothered.
[0:47:21] <$Sphincter_Spelunker> poggers
[0:47:22] <%MarylandJutsu> @TheNewZealandStory allright be a contrarian
[0:47:24] <+A_DEAD_SHOW> D E D
[0:47:27] <+doc_ock_rokc> DBD is a game about roleplaying a slasher villian...so don't be pragmatic and don't camp
[0:47:32] <+mikesapartment> you literally lose points
[0:47:37] <RetributionP> but winning the videogame
[0:47:46] <$GarbageNirvana> Sometimes survivors be camping too
[0:47:49] <%TheZearGuy> It‚Äôs a legitimate strategy, just a bitch move.
[0:47:51] <MayorRev> epic gamer strats
[0:47:52] <$AzureGale> SCREW YOU FUTURISTIA
[0:48:00] <+doc_ock_rokc> @RetributionP you lose if you do that
[0:48:06] <RyuuAoi> He needs to go back to COD
[0:48:06] <$GarbageNirvana> idk I've seen a lot more bullshit survivor plays than I have killer plays
[0:48:12] <RetributionP> but they won tho
[0:48:12] <$GarbageNirvana> But then I haven't seen a whole lotta survivor streams
[0:48:13] <$TIME_PUNCHER> you know who else likes camping? Bear Grylls. therefore campers drink pee pee
[0:48:14] <+Mendin> There's even a lore reason for camping to penalize killers points - The Entity (evil crabspider Jesus who empowers the killers) feeds on survivors futile hope
[0:48:20] <%king_wragles> There's also the situation of survivors just swarming someone hooked nearby, which doesn't feel great cause then you're kinda forced to camp
[0:48:23] <+Mendin> So camping them is less "Oh maybe I'll get away" juice
[0:48:23] <@SoFarFetched> Both Survivors AND killers can be toxic.
[0:48:29] <%MarylandJutsu> ^
[0:48:32] <Zeif00> If killers camp I just do the gens, might as well not reward them for it
[0:48:35] <+doc_ock_rokc> @GarbageNirvana Yeah Survivors can be assholes too
[0:48:36] <%king_wragles> Tho you could let the unhook happen, which also feels bad
[0:48:37] <%MarylandJutsu> people are in fact....awful
[0:48:37] <$dozind16> nice cat cam
[0:48:42] <$GarbageNirvana> Well sure
[0:48:47] <@SoFarFetched> You just see more survivor toxicity because well you can be dealing with all 4 survivors being toxic in one game.
[0:48:47] <Ziegsy> Bear grylls never drank pee. it was all staged.
[0:48:50] <$TIME_PUNCHER> everyone is toxic except for me
[0:48:57] <$GarbageNirvana> Really in games like this anyone and everyone can be an asshole
[0:49:06] <%MarylandJutsu> its fine paige we get to see elmo
[0:49:11] <$dozind16> no pressure we come for elmo anyways
[0:49:12] <%MarylandJutsu> and that gives us serotonin
[0:49:18] <%king_wragles> Survivors are usually more toxic because you feel safer in a group
[0:49:20] <+doc_ock_rokc> @PeachSaliva Hey Peach what ever happened to that avatar I made you?
[0:49:28] <%king_wragles> but killers can really be awful at times
[0:49:29] <extradopeness> hello today!
[0:49:33] <Ziegsy> you should film elmo sleeping and just loop that footage to trick people
[0:49:35] <+floniac> Are you a survivor main Paige?
[0:49:40] <@SoFarFetched> yeah she mains survivor
[0:49:42] <%MarylandJutsu> yes she is flo
[0:49:43] <$cade_calrayn> absorbs the serotonin from the Emlo
[0:49:52] <%MarylandJutsu> but she sometimes plays freddie i think?
[0:50:00] <@SoFarFetched> and Paige I will hop in if you need the help geefPoint
[0:50:02] <%king_wragles> There are moments where I wonder if I'm just stuck with psychopaths when I'm survivor, and bullies when I'm killer
[0:50:03] <RyuuAoi> It's alright, Peach! I feel you! We need to make time for self love!
[0:50:09] <+floniac> Thanks Mary
[0:50:09] <+doc_ock_rokc> What perks she wants
[0:50:22] <+Mendin> The thing is that survivors can and often do coordinate out of game (ie discord) which gives them a massive power boost, and there's a giant semi-arbitrary Code of Honor people expect killers to play by
[0:50:33] <@SoFarFetched> "The survivors rulebook"
[0:50:33] <+doc_ock_rokc> Freddy is strunk
[0:50:38] <%MarylandJutsu> thank god they made freddie not bad
[0:50:41] <+Mendin> So killers sometimes go "You know what I am just killing all of you by any means necessary and eat shit"
[0:50:49] <@SoFarFetched> yeah thats fine Paige
[0:50:53] <@MelBrooksKA> Good evening Paige and chat, welcome back home
[0:50:54] <+Mendin> And then Behavior nerfs killers more when they do that
[0:50:58] <+doc_ock_rokc> @Mendin AKA seeing a key
[0:51:00] <+floniac> Yeah, i like Freddy too
[0:51:01] <Justaguy3> @peachsaliva less favorite survivor?
[0:51:05] <%MarylandJutsu> hallo mel
[0:51:12] <RyuuAoi> Never sleep again...
[0:51:19] <+floniac> It gets lonely as killer
[0:51:27] <$Sphincter_Spelunker> like any comp game
[0:51:30] <Nekros4442> That's just a pvp game in general
[0:51:32] <%MarylandJutsu> any online multiplayer has toxicity
[0:51:32] <hearingthenseeing> TOXIC
[0:51:36] <Nekros4442> There's awlays gonna be those people
[0:51:43] <+Mendin> The DBD forums are amazing in that nearly all killer posters think survivors are OP/favored by the devs, and all survivor mains think the opposite
[0:51:45] <$AzureGale> Ugh
[0:51:46] <@MelBrooksKA> @MarylandJutsu spyPraise spyPraise
[0:51:57] <+ArcanumArcanum> i just laugh in their face when people are toxic in this game
[0:52:00] <Dementedpenguin> I always facepalm when someone DC's but then stays the whole match for post chat NotLikeThis
[0:52:01] <+ArcanumArcanum> it makes them even more mad
[0:52:01] <Piemono> Yeah but they won, and thus have a huge cock and you need to know
[0:52:02] <+NWR_James> GG EZ PG
[0:52:02] <SpaceGuntank> DbD is the most toxic game i've ever played, its insane LUL
[0:52:02] <RyuuAoi> When's Left 4 Dead stream with you, Pat, Woolie, and Plague?
[0:52:02] <neZkota> do you like the pride charm
[0:52:06] <%king_wragles> I mean the devs do way prefer survivor
[0:52:09] <@SoFarFetched> Wins the game: "wow what a trash killer."  Gets killed in the game: "wow what a trash killer"
[0:52:22] <RyuuAoi> Shit up little boy! Go beat your meat! Ha
[0:52:25] <Ziegsy> @sofarfetched

[0:52:58] <%MarylandJutsu> gasp that isn't a patch of grass at all! It supports the gays!
[0:53:01] <+ArcanumArcanum> Gotta use the pay2lose cosmetics that make you super easy to see

[0:53:05] <+floniac> Pride charm is pretty nice
[0:53:09] <$Sphincter_Spelunker> Paige hides around corners like Chopper LuvPeekL
[0:53:10] <Psyramics> you should dress as a clown, they won't be expecting that
[0:53:11] <RyuuAoi> Go hard or go home

[0:59:59] <$cade_calrayn> Paige fulfills the Can Cook and Can Drive points of the Gay Triangle. She can't do math

[1:17:16] <bob900000> GayPride
[1:17:21] <$cade_calrayn> That just seems.... odd lol
[1:17:24] <@commanderclaw> The Entity says yay Pride
[1:17:31] <MayorRev> Leon has a flashbang right? wouldnt that be an easier way to blind killers?
[1:17:32] <Naho_Saenoki> Why would the Entity care about that though?
[1:17:32] <Jetsfantasy> Never expires btw
[1:17:38] <%MarylandJutsu> @commanderclaw its equal opportunity for murder @Naho_Saenoki
[1:17:39] <Estuko> RANKROULETTE gives 250k bloodpoints too
[1:17:39] <$rdark_ksu> until july 1st anyways
[1:17:39] <$cade_calrayn> The Entity says Death to All and Also Gay Rights
[1:17:49] <Naho_Saenoki> Fair enough.
[1:17:51] <californaya> this game has golden halos and Jill Valentine, nothing matters, lol
[1:17:56] <@SoFarFetched> @MayorRev Resident evil DLC isn't out yet
[1:17:56] <+Ragnakawaii> The Entity is the ally we all need
[1:17:57] <ashenfrenzy> Leon's not released yet
[1:17:58] <jetpack_rorschasch> Wait... so gay people are killers? Is that the message? WutFace
[1:17:59] <MayorRev> oh
[1:18:01] <@commanderclaw> The Entity believes all mortal life is equally worthless
[1:18:05] <skyentombment> @MarylandJutsu I don't know about that, but he'll also make Paige feel Big Embarass
[1:18:05] <$TIME_PUNCHER> the Entity hungers but it doesn't discriminate
[1:18:15] <+ArsCaelia> diversity win! the horrifying abomination dead set on murder celebrates pride!
[1:18:18] <JonKhan> 2 panicke dpeople try to heal another panicked person
[1:18:21] <skyentombment> Look at this cuddle puddle
[1:18:23] <VentWilsn> i mean the Babadook is a lgbt icon, why not the entity?
[1:18:23] <@SoFarFetched> The killers can be a little gay....as a treat.
[1:18:25] <plaguedoctor_syan> Good thing you don¬¥t get extra points for beating a queer character
[1:18:32] <+StevorenoElcamino> Entity cares cuz they‚Äôre just an titty

[1:19:11] <californaya> so is this hell? is that the lore?
[1:19:16] <Naho_Saenoki> I didn't know about the holiday stuff. DBD is just one of those things I'm vaguely aware exitst, usually.
[1:19:21] <%MarylandJutsu> @californaya more like a purgatory
[1:19:23] <Sotetsu> @peachsaliva Did that spider falling on you affect the timing of your return to Canada?
[1:19:27] <+FingaLights> Evil Santa Killer would be great
[1:19:28] <Estuko> I mean... the fan art of the killers and victims are very lgbtq friendly

[1:20:08] <@SoFarFetched> @californaya It's pretty much the entity's realm where he's makes survivors/killers disappear. So Survivors will forever always be trying to escape while the killers will forever be serviing the entity offering sacrifices to it.
[1:20:16] <@SoFarFetched> Where he's made*
[1:20:17] <+NickNackProductions> that's essentially when the entity's realm is @VentWilsn

[1:46:29] <%ShootThatZombie> wait what happened and why??
[1:46:44] <VentWilsn> time for trapdoor
[1:47:05] <@SoFarFetched> well only hatch if it hasn't been closed by killer. (unless you have a key to reopen it)
[1:47:11] <VentWilsn> it was a nice attempt
[1:47:19] <@SoFarFetched> goodbye plague
[1:47:31] <VentWilsn> hatch can be closed by killer now?
[1:47:34] <+Mendin> So much for plague's new internet pole
[1:47:40] <+Mendin> Killer can stomp the hatch closed if it's open yes
[1:47:47] <nauskills> DBD's menu theme is so good
[1:48:10] <Zeif00> You can open the gate right before the first light turns on, wait for the killer to leave and then finish opening it
[1:48:14] <+Mendin> Hey I did specify the pole
[1:48:15] <calzonewithextracheese> yeah what happened with hololive?
[1:48:18] <Profmcstevie> We'll get you of there someday Plague usedBeef
[1:48:27] <VentWilsn> so only after a survivor opens it first?
[1:48:38] <+Mendin> It opens automatically if one survivor is left
[1:48:41] <Jetsfantasy> ping and average response are the real killers
[1:48:41] <$TIME_PUNCHER> rural satellite microwave internet is rough
[1:48:49] <@SoFarFetched> @VentWilsn Yeah hatch can be closed by killers now after a patch like years ago.
[1:49:24] <otakon17> oh hey it's Plague
[1:49:29] <@SoFarFetched> and hatch opens if you are the last survivor.
[1:49:45] <@SoFarFetched> But there's still the regular requirements for having hatch to appear.
[1:49:46] <VentWilsn> oh ok
[1:50:09] <VentWilsn> i forgot hatch only works after only one person is left
[1:50:20] <%AncelDeLambert> I'm playing it right now
[1:50:27] <%AncelDeLambert> It's... it's going places

[1:52:56] <@SoFarFetched> because stinky cats apparently
[1:53:04] <%AncelDeLambert> I have absolutely no clue as to the rate of rabies among skunks
[1:53:17] <mikeriffic> We all do
[1:53:17] <hearingthenseeing> Sometimes?
[1:53:21] <%AncelDeLambert> all I know about skunks is that they're constantly roadkill around here
[1:53:25] <DrkJP520> you don't wanna fuck with rabies
[1:53:28] <+WaywardSera> what does that make Wolverines?

[1:53:37] <$TIME_PUNCHER> thinkin bout them beans
[1:53:48] <otakon17> they're near sighted too
[1:53:50] <$rdark_ksu> ferrets too
[1:53:51] <otakon17> they got musk
[1:53:57] <deathygz> skunks got that kush stink
[1:53:57] <otakon17> they're weasel family is why
[1:54:09] <$TIME_PUNCHER> skunk pigs are a thing too
[1:54:09] <VentWilsn> thinking about playstation moves heroes
[1:54:14] <Zourath> Skunks, nature's Smash players.
[1:54:17] <otakon17> I love ferrets
[1:54:22] <otakon17> slinky cats
[1:54:23] <deathygz> ferrets smell so bad and they steal your socks and hide them
[1:54:40] <mikeriffic> I saw someone taking their ferret for a walk on a leash once @PeachSaliva
[1:54:41] <otakon17> you just have to clean them regularly
[1:54:41] <bomi1995> any ive seen smell like pee
[1:54:46] <blue8moon> ferrets are stinky by default
[1:54:48] <otakon17> that's all there is to it
[1:54:59] <otakon17> they can be de-musked
[1:55:06] <XenoDandelion> I knew someone who had three ferrets and her house was AWFUL smelly
[1:55:09] <otakon17> but their leavings are very strong of odor
[1:55:12] <bob900000> have you met more than one ferret
[1:55:15] <+SharpClaw_> cause cats arent stinky at all
[1:55:18] <$rdark_ksu> I will not take this anti catsnake slander
[1:55:18] <Profmcstevie> Gief likely makes you smell stinky with his goo
[1:55:20] <%CopperTucker> I saw two baby skunks playing in the grass by the road today. They were cute.
[1:55:24] <deathygz> i had to take care of 2 ferrets for a while
[1:55:24] <otakon17> so you need to clean their litterboxes frequent
[1:55:27] <Dementedpenguin> I first found out about ferrets because of Kindergarten Cop. So thanks, Arnold.
[1:55:27] <DrkJP520> doesn't like stinky ferrets, but love stinky elmo
[1:55:31] <deathygz> theyre cute and hyperactive but hoo boy
[1:55:32] <$TIME_PUNCHER> all people are stinky unless they dose themselves with environment annihilating chemicals

[1:56:45] <bomi1995> pet rats are super cool but they dont live long
[1:56:51] <otakon17> rats are not weasels
[1:56:54] <Broand> This is where I'd put a clemps emote if i had one
[1:56:55] <otakon17> and weasels are not rodents

[1:57:27] <Broand> Rats and weasels are very different, One of the distinctions is that rats can't swim.
[1:57:33] <DrkJP520> What about pigeons? They are basically rodents.
[1:57:34] <mikeriffic> @raineedaydreams pfft i bet you think birds are real to

[1:58:45] <otakon17> they should have been called Tall Wolves
[1:59:01] <%holydeviant1> Like a bad child drawing
[1:59:02] <deathygz> what is the evolutionary benefit of long legs on a vegetarian

[2:03:27] <MayorRev> baba is P!
[2:03:28] <BettyMwwaahh> @mikeriffic thats how my brother thought it was pronounced for months till he said it out loud around me
[2:03:30] <$TIME_PUNCHER> liripepe
[2:03:35] <%AncelDeLambert> that's a silly name for "hood"
[2:04:04] <$NitronStreams> liripipe
[2:04:07] <+Jp3g95> according to google it actually is the way Paige pronounced it
[2:04:17] <otakon17> the minish cap was a Phrygian cap
[2:04:20] <deathygz> link is a smurf?
[2:04:22] <$TIME_PUNCHER> maybe the fictional video game character is wearing a hat with no real world analogue
[2:04:25] <otakon17> he's a Hylian
[2:04:28] <ironohki> I just got here. Is that Plague?
[2:04:30] <placeholder03> Phrygian like the musical scale?
[2:04:31] <%AncelDeLambert> crap, now I want to replay minish cap
[2:04:39] <$GarbageNirvana> He wears it backwards because he's a cool '90s kid
[2:04:51] <%AncelDeLambert> well, it keeps your head warm
[2:04:53] <otakon17> besides keeping his head warm
[2:04:57] <BettyMwwaahh> Link likes to sleep. so there is a reason
[2:05:01] <otakon17> WAIT
[2:05:01] <Jetsfantasy> It's a windsock :)
[2:05:02] <otakon17> LTTP
[2:05:09] <otakon17> YOU WERE LITERALLY WOKEN UP FROM SLEEP IN BED
[2:05:15] <otakon17> IT IS HIS STOCKING CAP
[2:05:17] <$GarbageNirvana> I think I saw promo art once upon a time that he stores things in his hat somewhere?
[2:05:25] <deathygz> reminded me of ed edd and eddy
[2:05:27] <%AncelDeLambert> Paige, stop inflicting others with your personal taste in men
[2:05:30] <ironohki> Bald powers.
[2:05:31] <+Ynkubus_> Being the hero of time is super stressful
[2:05:36] <mikeriffic> But was Pat always bald?
[2:05:37] <+CatastropheCorvid> Just Pat
[2:05:40] <+patriotrenegade> Caped Baldy
[2:05:41] <ironohki> @AncelDeLambert Which is skeleton?
[2:05:43] <%AncelDeLambert> not everyone can be a perfect skeleton
[2:05:45] <$AzureGale> The pointy hat is like slightly less weird than the lack of pants in some of his incarnations
[2:05:46] <bob900000> pat still has some hair
[2:05:48] <+tempestzephyr> it's based on the Minish Cap on the GBA
[2:05:54] <DrkJP520> A rat is actually sitting in his hat controlling him
[2:05:56] <Aleate> Hair Plague would make me nervous
[2:06:06] <Ell1ot> what if he takes off his hat and that's what his head is shaped like
[2:06:10] <HoldBtoRun> Paige can't handle people with hair, it frightens and confuses her
[2:06:12] <deathygz> plague sounds less like a bald guy and more like a starbucks cashier
[2:06:14] <@SoFarFetched> Paige can only remember people by a certain haircut.
[2:06:19] <@SoFarFetched> if you cut your hair she forgets who you are
[2:06:30] <+patriotrenegade> @PeachSaliva Is "Eli" short for "Elliot" or "Elijah"
[2:06:33] <otakon17> *** I mean this is Link in the animated series from the 90's
[2:06:34] <+patriotrenegade> Or Elias
[2:06:39] <BettyMwwaahh> idk what Plague looks like. i wanna keep i that way. for the mystery
[2:06:48] <XenoDandelion> handsome boy
[2:06:57] <@SoFarFetched> Probably because you're not in chat Eli.
[2:06:58] <+patriotrenegade> LAME
[2:07:00] <@SoFarFetched> so they had to @ paige.
[2:07:07] <mikeriffic> Elian

[2:07:37] <+rockcentuar> im sure some of your fans would love to give it a shot
[2:07:44] <Broand> Is the wait usually this long?
[2:07:47] <@SoFarFetched> it shouldn't
[2:08:02] <deathygz> i think getting matches as killer is wya faster at this time
[2:08:06] <Zeif00> maybe you need to remake the lobby?
[2:08:06] <deathygz> i never get survivor around this time

[2:08:38] <+patriotrenegade> yeah, play Titanfall 2
[2:08:49] <Tooniearcade> tank or healer
[2:08:52] <DianaTheAscian> both
[2:08:54] <%holydeviant1> Only need one killer, you need four survivors, of course killers have short queues
[2:08:55] <@SoFarFetched> yeah tank or healer pretty much
[2:08:58] <Lolcola34> heals and tanks
[2:08:58] <%holydeviant1> it's maffs
[2:08:58] <@SoFarFetched> cause a lot of people play DPS
[2:09:01] <Broand> In ff14 healer + tank are sought after because everyone in the world plays DPS
[2:09:02] <CryoByjorne> healer then tank then dps
[2:09:03] <+ArsCaelia> both
[2:09:03] <BettyMwwaahh> usually less tanks. more responsibility
[2:09:03] <@commanderclaw> Healer has instant queues cause people hate responsibility
[2:09:05] <+bromontana> @PeachSaliva Paige are you gonna upload the cooking stream to youtube? I only caught the end of it
[2:09:08] <weissguard> It's that people like to play DPS way more, so Tank and Healer have shorter ques
[2:09:09] <Jetsfantasy> Anyone can, depending on the role needed at the time. But it's mostly tank/healer
[2:09:09] <DedlokPM> Tanks and Healers have a LOT quicker times than DPS @PeachSaliva
[2:09:13] <Broand> I started off as DPS, i regret my decision
[2:09:14] <FairOnFire> it's both
[2:09:15] <MrPandastic> Yup queues are pretty much instant for tanks and healers
[2:09:20] <+ArsCaelia> dps is infinite queue as punishment
[2:09:29] <Jetsfantasy> Female Hrothgar and Male Viera
[2:09:35] <+patriotrenegade> HOT
[2:09:36] <@commanderclaw> BEEG AND STRONK
[2:09:36] <XenoDandelion> bromon the archive is up on here I thought
[2:09:40] <Ell1ot> i think tanks and healers have faster queue times
[2:09:51] <BettyMwwaahh> if you play dps then you're selfish so you get long que times
[2:09:52] <Broand> KING from tekken?
[2:09:58] <GrooovinMagic> Preach Eli, preach!
[2:10:00] <SuperVaderMan> I would suspect that, because Japan, it'll just be like an overly human thing with cat ears
[2:10:02] <Aleate> Or rabbit ears stapled on a twink Kappa
[2:10:05] <clockworkidiot> buff lion women or we riot
[2:10:07] <+patriotrenegade> SIX TITS
[2:10:08] <otakon17> The Beast from the Ron Perlman series?

[2:10:16] <otakon17> @clockworkidiot TALL buff lion women
[2:10:20] <BettyMwwaahh> theyre gonna look like aru. its gonna be so dissapointing
[2:10:26] <$TIME_PUNCHER> Eli has turned into a broom he's so sweepy
[2:10:37] <Jetsfantasy> We need a cat woman who can smash things and break boulders
[2:10:37] <clockworkidiot> @otakon17 YES
[2:10:40] <mikeriffic> Cat with Human Ears
[2:10:44] <deathygz> youre either beast stars or carmeldansen
[2:10:48] <%Reaped_Psyche> It sounds like they're baisically just doing female Ronso from FFX.
[2:10:55] <otakon17> I hear Elmo baby
[2:10:57] <otakon17> he fussy
[2:11:00] <+patriotrenegade> he screm
[2:11:00] <$AzureGale> Literally every female FFXIV race is human lady + head decorations
[2:11:01] <otakon17> he so fussy
[2:11:10] <+patriotrenegade> he screm at own ass
[2:11:11] <otakon17> tall buff anime waifu
[2:11:15] <+patriotrenegade> FUCK
[2:11:16] <+YoSoyConando89> If they follow the Ronso they'll be dangerously cheesy
[2:11:20] <%samTUMZfestival> excuse you peach
[2:11:21] <placeholder03> do cat ear girls have the human ears too?
[2:11:22] <$TIME_PUNCHER> what happened to Rift
[2:11:25] <+patriotrenegade> I FORGOT ABOUT BLESS THE RAPPER
[2:11:29] <@commanderclaw> Oh yeah, those look decent
[2:11:37] <otakon17> Blade and Soul is a Korean MMO with some BIG ladies
[2:11:40] <blue8moon> the in-game mural art of female hrothgar looks like female ronso, though take that with a grain of salt
[2:11:54] <$TIME_PUNCHER> Cowboys From Hell?
[2:11:55] <VentWilsn> maybe ff14 is doing the same thing as League of Legends where they want to appeal to Japan by making everything a cute girl
[2:11:57] <+YoSoyConando89> Not in 14. The catpeople only have cat ears
[2:11:59] <FairOnFire> those bless cat ladies almost got me to play that
[2:12:17] <otakon17> what do female Ronso look like?
[2:12:24] <$NitronStreams> pso2 has male Casts that are basically Gundams and female Casts that are anime girls with robot armor
[2:12:54] <+YoSoyConando89> Hrothgar have hair, it's just kinda a poopy texture
[2:12:54] <@commanderclaw> Eh, I think the female Ronso are less "Lion on a human" than the hrothgar
[2:12:54] <GrooovinMagic> Femroes for life
[2:12:55] <otakon17> big hands and feet, very feline face with hair on the head and covered in short dense furt
[2:13:07] <BettyMwwaahh> Beastmaster Raha from Battlechasers: Nightwar is what i want

[2:28:30] <@commanderclaw> Yeah, it'd work better in a novel with narration about Etrayu's mental state
[2:28:31] <$TIME_PUNCHER> the guy who played atreyu is a tattoo artist in Amsterdam now
[2:28:31] <otakon17> you people are monsters
[2:28:32] <%brokendarktower> i think the dog face was supposed to make u feel for it if your a dog lover person
[2:28:33] <otakon17> MONSTERS
[2:28:34] <%walternatorz> Paige is about to spit fire
[2:28:35] <%samTUMZfestival> Oh God
[2:28:36] <Broand> Not anymore!
[2:28:37] <+ScrapKingKeita> NOT ANYMORE
[2:28:37] <%AncelDeLambert> "dragon" originally meant "monster", so, yes, literally anything can be a "dragon"
[2:28:40] <+Jonny_Worldbeater> "Does Japan do dragons?"
[2:28:41] <%ospreyworks> Yeah, Neverending Story is pretty meandering
[2:28:41] <%Ranryu692> and big tits

[2:28:49] <otakon17> I mean the dog face for Falcor was to make him look more friendly
[2:28:51] <@SoFarFetched> ye look at all the console
[2:28:51] <+DragonTrainerBen> you think the first movie is weird, The Never Ending Story 2 is even more either "nothings happening" or "WTF is happening!?" and you never know when its gonna switch.
[2:28:52] <benjiFG> reminded me :(
[2:28:53] <$AzureGale> Fire Emblem has dragons that are all lolis
[2:28:55] <+JobbedBone> D: CONAN NO
[2:28:55] <CryoByjorne> dragon vtuber is retiring
[2:29:01] <otakon17> since giving him a typical lizard face would make him scarier looking
[2:29:01] <PinoProxie> oh shit this is a video game stream I forgot
[2:29:01] <Aleate> Its been 84 years. This is gonna be the BEST match
[2:29:02] <DrkJP520> Not only is Paige a lizard, she's a dragon!

[2:39:34] <$NitronStreams> MA'AM
[2:39:38] <%samTUMZfestival> Record scratch
[2:39:49] <@SoFarFetched> I just realized the two who disconnected are probably a couple or something  because their names are almost similiar geefBruh
[2:40:15] <%samTUMZfestival> GIRL POWER ‚úå
[2:40:18] <%samTUMZfestival> .....
[2:40:25] <@SoFarFetched> she's following the wrong person to find things geefBlind
[2:40:31] <+Smashking91> D/c pacts are real
[2:40:34] <%brokendarktower> lol
[2:40:34] <@SoFarFetched> as Paige has trouble finding things
[2:40:41] <+mostbrokenrobo> lol bye Claudette
[2:40:49] <%brokendarktower> if she only knew betta
[2:41:26] <@SoFarFetched> Im half expecting low ranks for the two who quit
[2:41:27] <+Jonny_Worldbeater> Real talk: Good on Paige for maintaining a regular schedule recently. One way or another, these streams are always entertaining.
[2:42:30] <@SoFarFetched> He probably went to wonder while you finish gens
[2:43:03] <@SoFarFetched> Apparently its two types of totems or something? geefThink
[2:43:06] <Oxybe> Collusion
[2:43:10] <$NitronStreams> ü§£
[2:43:28] <CaptainKarite> You got 3 overcharge checks in a row and then this lol
[2:43:31] <+Smashking91> Time for a paddlin
[2:43:34] <+Jonny_Worldbeater> What's the dude even doing?
[2:43:45] <@SoFarFetched> Wraith is letting them finish generators
[2:43:54] <CaptainKarite> he's back packin
[2:43:56] <%samTUMZfestival> I'm hungry. I want wings now...
[2:44:08] <$NitronStreams> Bing Bong out here giving piggy back rides
[2:44:10] <VentWilsn> hes giving upsies
[2:44:11] <@SoFarFetched> this has become a farming match
[2:44:14] <CaptainKarite> I believe he wishes to leave
[2:44:50] <VentWilsn> "most killers are not cool"
[2:44:55] <+JobbedBone> I don't understand the game enough to know why hes going easy LUL is it impossible with two D/Cs?
[2:44:56] <+mostbrokenrobo> "he's so nice!  he only stabs us a little bit!"
[2:44:59] <Oxybe> Killing... with kindness.
[2:45:19] <%samTUMZfestival> Do you have the.... Hookup?
[2:45:29] <+mostbrokenrobo> Paige hooking?
[2:45:29] <%Nox_Ludicro> @JobbedBone with 2 DCs the game is just not fun.  So people sometimes just dick around for points.
[2:45:38] <+Jonny_Worldbeater> What is even happening?
[2:45:39] <%samTUMZfestival> THAT WOULD TEAR YOU APART
[2:45:41] <+skeletrail> We love to see a playerbase that helps eachother
[2:45:42] <@SoFarFetched> @JobbedBone the match barely started and two people disconnected,finishing 5 generators  with just 2 people is tough. Unless you're really good at hiding and evading t he killer  for that long until all 5 are done to open the gates. (or you find a key to open hatch after meeting the requirement)
[2:45:52] <DrkJP520> a little dance maybe
[2:46:02] <+JobbedBone> ahh, tyty
[2:46:04] <Zeif00> I'm honestly surprised they haven't started selling emotes in the shop
[2:46:08] <Case_Ah_Dia> legion should have emotes
[2:46:14] <Oxybe> just put in the fortnite dance
[2:46:24] <VentWilsn> yea wheres the bill emote?
[2:46:25] <tanarath> what about a dab?
[2:46:30] <+mikesapartment> two teabags, one for each syllable
[2:46:37] <+Jonny_Worldbeater> @mostbrokenrobo she does have the ugly hooker boots.
[2:46:40] <%samTUMZfestival> I'm glad only older movies have iconic "Monsters" they can offer.
[2:46:44] <@SoFarFetched> Leave your flashlight for him geefPoint cause he was nice
[2:47:01] <%samTUMZfestival> Their choice seems to be good.
[2:47:02] <+Smashking91> One last flash for good measure
[2:47:09] <%samTUMZfestival> Choices*
[2:47:13] <%samTUMZfestival> Spanked ya
[2:47:17] <+JobbedBone> LUL hate to see em leave but love to watch em go

[2:47:53] <$NitronStreams> Bing Bong is not the hero we deserve but the hero we need
[2:47:55] <+Mendin> The big influx of console players is great for queues and horrible for postgame chat/salt
[2:48:03] <+Mendin> because you cant get any
[2:48:24] <@SoFarFetched> Paige: Will thank you for being nice AFTER blinding you geefBlind
