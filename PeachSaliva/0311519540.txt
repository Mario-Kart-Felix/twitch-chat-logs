[0:33:28] <awsomesaucekirby> cheer232 i had a dream the other night, Pat and Paige were finally getting married, but then Pat burst into the ceremony, and it turned out to have been a mimic who had wooed her to seal the deal. But it was a ds3 style mimic, his waist opened to be the big mouth, and the long gangly legs and arms sprouted from his shoulderblades and ass. She still married the Pat-mic

[0:34:26] <KilljoyHexx> I appreciate that pat went to look up what was pokemon 101
[0:34:28] <+badchoice5> Chancey has a ton of HP and very little attack, so it just sits there and eats hits
[0:34:29] <%SuperCasualBoom> Paige is Lupuscutte
[0:34:32] <Prism_Wing> AngriestChansey

[0:35:09] <redwilt> Paige really likes Bakugon
[0:35:14] <vampireinarm> where is ze orange goblin man?
[0:35:14] <%YourFavoriteShiba> cheer200 BTW, you may not remember, but I made a whole Emperor crazy speech in your Portal 2 playthrough. It's from a YT series call 'If the Emperor had a Text-to-Speech Device'. It's a parody of Warhammer 40K and it's hilarious. You actually learn a good bit about the lore while laughing your ass off. I highly recommend you and Pat watch it when you can.
[0:35:16] <eco419> He is a ghost
[0:35:18] <indonesianbob67> damn paige is a bakugon head
[0:35:20] <zal_silverfang> @deviljhojho94 yes. but let me counter with Mewtwo and that double neck tube though
[0:35:28] <PakuV2> Man B-Daman was the most transparent show ever
[0:35:33] <+badchoice5> 3.0 or 3.5

[0:35:47] <+animio> the ghost of christmas pat
[0:35:48] <+badchoice5> RUN YOU HERO YOU
[0:35:51] <gustavozxd> this is nothing compared to persona 2 encounter rate
[0:35:53] <%maskedriderhero> Paige solely plays Monster Rancher
[0:35:53] <Sapphireowls> My cat Luna is watching. :)

[0:36:40] <+badchoice5> HOW CAN THIS BE?!?!
[0:36:46] <+anar_bael> 5e is defiantly easier to get into but 3.5 has so much weird stuff thats great
[0:36:48] <AncelDeLambert> Zut alor!

[0:50:37] <$superorangerobin> I'm a Garnet. Best birthstone AND best rock mom
[0:50:45] <zal_silverfang> by that logic wouldnt gold just be yellow trying not to be piss?

[1:13:43] <+QuadraticGravity> "Buy - Mysidia, then Dwarven Castle and onwards." - Final Fantasy 4 Wiki
[1:13:49] <eco419> I am the cure2
[1:13:54] <SirDogBear> it might be more efficient to just get tents and recover mp if you need heals in battles
[1:13:56] <Kobra_Kid1083> Prompto is the ultimate hyper fan boy for chocobos
[1:13:56] <+Ramsus88> that is baron

[1:14:24] <gustavozxd> my fav boy is prompto too he's great
[1:14:24] <%deacon1621> @Agami23 Hey that's an idea, but they'd have to have the patience to devote a few streams to it. It only gets good once you start really unlocking stuff.
[1:14:27] <SomersaultJustice> THAT';S AGART
[1:14:31] <awsomesaucekirby> cheer232 I'm Talking like a 45-90 min one off, maybe have a bunch of people buy a few spots, and you have a hodgepodge stream, knock out 3-5

[1:16:35] <%SuperCasualBoom> cheer200 Thanks for the incredible hijinks from “Miss Direction and Whiffle Pickle Hour”. Thank goodness Paige wasn’t playing Chrono Trigger. Let’s travel to the past and Paige ends up 5 minutes in the future.
[1:16:36] <Rikuo86> You tellin' me Paige doesn't work at a Mustard factory? heinz should be all over her
[1:16:46] <%DrWolpertinger> @peachsaliva dont read my donation aloud just msg me
[1:16:48] <%Mekhet09> It's completely different.
[1:16:50] <+cereal_box_conspiracy> I think Japanese mayo has sugar in it.
[1:16:53] <+brentoland> Spicy Mayo is freaking great
[1:16:59] <%leirazamzam> i mean MAYBE she works at a secret mustard factory lol
[1:17:04] <zal_silverfang> might be using duck egg in the mayo or something
[1:17:04] <%leirazamzam> the possibilities are endless
[1:17:05] <+king_wragles> Isn't Japanese mayo called kewpie?
[1:17:07] <+xxviios> Mayo is the WORST
[1:17:10] <PakuV2> The ketchup in Germany is superior
[1:17:16] <Bryon_W> ^
[1:17:25] <%umbypokochan> you'll get better weapons in chests
[1:17:26] <%deacon1621> The first few major differences between regular and Japanese mayo came easily—up the egg count, drop the egg whites, switch to vegetable oil, use rice vinegar instead of white, and add MSG. The latter is a controversial ingredient, but if Japanese mayo flavor is what you're going for, it's essential.
[1:17:26] <Bryon_W> It doesn't taste like vinegar and shame.
[1:17:27] <Rikuo86> Condiment wars: Go
[1:17:30] <%deacon1621> And now we all know\
[1:17:30] <+king_wragles> JAPANESE MAYO IS CALLED KEWPIE
[1:17:38] <SirDogBear> the fire sword is neat since it got the little fire slash animation from what i remember

[1:17:57] <%SuperCasualBoom> Paige there a powerful sword in sky sword. No buy
[1:17:59] <%heyitsbrian> can use
[1:18:00] <seniorwhiteface> Japanese Mayo is called poop where Im from
[1:18:01] <%Mekhet09> Just tat he can use it.
[1:18:01] <%umbypokochan> you'll get the icebrand i think in a chest in the place
[1:18:06] <%SuperCasualBoom> Just that he can use it
[1:18:14] <+BringBackSempai> lol
[1:18:15] <Bryon_W> Brown horseradish mustard > yellow mustard.

[1:21:12] <deviljhojho94> Fire walk with me
[1:21:13] <%heyitsbrian> I have done a fire walk!
[1:21:18] <energywarning> confidently
[1:21:18] <rabidmonkey32> flat feet
[1:21:19] <buffmurffy> you mean hot coals?
[1:21:20] <Bryon_W> It's called "Don't fall down like Michael Scott"
[1:21:21] <rabidmonkey32> not fast
[1:21:22] <%Keyd00d> gotta light?
[1:21:25] <%leirazamzam> what even is a fire walk. sounds painful
[1:21:26] <The_Esquana> Have you guys seen the new Kanye music video? Even if your a music hater like pat, you should at least give it a look, its pretty uh 'intersting.' @PeachSaliva
[1:21:29] <%Remery_> Get in my juices.
[1:21:31] <$Agami23> isnt mysidia the purple stuff that grows on mushroom stuff in minecraft?
[1:21:32] <grayjammer> You just walk at a normal speed
[1:21:41] <blackbaron98> how do you do it then?
[1:21:42] <SirDogBear> i remember this raven monster was awesome because cecil could kill it with the death sword in one hit
[1:21:47] <AMajorTom> maybe not fast, but no stopping for selfies
[1:21:47] <TheZombiepope> Running means you slam your feet down onto the coals so you just calmly walk across
[1:21:48] <%heyitsbrian> it was freaky, but was an awesome rush at the end
[1:21:50] <+lethallunacyx> iit's so stupid
[1:21:53] <%SuperCasualBoom> Swoon!!!
[1:21:53] <deviljhojho94> I love it

[1:22:09] <Kobra_Kid1083> a hoe but i love you?
[1:22:10] <eco419> Is the Roblox one
[1:22:10] <grayjammer> If you walk normally, you have lighter and less foot contact with the coals
[1:22:10] <%mostundesired> Welp, time to look that shit up
[1:22:12] <%heyitsbrian> you have to keep walking, can't run, can't stop
[1:22:13] <Rikuo86> Sounds like Kanye alright

[1:22:23] <%heyitsbrian> which you weirdly get an urge to stop mid-way through
[1:22:24] <%GeneralSCPatton> Running puts extra force on the coals and increases the heat transfer
[1:22:27] <SubliminaIMessages> Hoes are awesome, the song
[1:22:29] <+animio> "im a sick fuck, i like a quick fuck" is the lyrics
[1:22:31] <+BringBackSempai> the new childish gambino is pretty chill
[1:22:32] <+Tyonidus> Probably dumb and stupid like most rap/hip-hop
[1:22:33] <$SparkAfterDark> If you run you will put too much pressure on the coals, breaking off the resistant casing the coal as developed and exposing your foot to the full heat
[1:22:38] <eco419> Something something hoe
[1:22:39] <rabidmonkey32> Wasn't it for pornhub awards?

[1:24:06] <%bluetocho13> how fast are dogs internet
[1:24:07] <The_Esquana> little pump
[1:24:08] <$SparkAfterDark> A fire walk requires you to let the coals burn for a while, until the flames are gone and all the coals have burnt down to an outer layer of ash. That outer layer is actually extremely resistant to heat, and won't transfer it to your skin if you touch it, but it's fragile and will break if you aren't walking gently and steadily over it. It's a bit like walking on thin ice
[1:24:09] <%Remery_> Fiber is only for the chosen ones :(

[1:43:55] <Copperama> Paige would probably cry to the ending of SA2...
[1:43:56] <%graffitisamurai> @PeachSaliva You should play Dragon Quest XI it gives me all the happy nostalgia feelings
[1:43:58] <%Mekhet09> Paige is never going to learn that tellah has an mp drain.
[1:44:02] <fairore> @worldbrand what are you talking about ?
[1:44:05] <$SparkAfterDark> Limbo or Inside might be good. they're short, and very linear but have just enough opportunity for Paige to get insanely stuck in so we can laugh at her

That was the version I played ff4 on (I'm one of the 4 people who own a vita), and though I haven't played the original to compare, I think it did a great job finessing the translation so it's a little less goofy, redoing the sprites and remastering the soundtrack. But I'm curious to know what you think of it if you've played it
[1:47:28] <DirtyDeedsDunDirtCheap> @agami23 having played the iOS and saw gameplay of the original ds, I actually feel the iOS looks better...

[2:06:46] <+redeq2> ONLY BAD PEOPLE ARE LEFTY
[2:06:53] <+BringBackSempai> look at this dragoon, gritting his teeth with the effort of not betraying everyone
[2:06:54] <AncelDeLambert> Why my Dragoon Master Race at?!
[2:06:57] <SirDogBear> i actually liked that about game, story driven parties
[2:06:59] <alrobot2014> In ff6 they aren't
[2:07:00] <+Cadwae> Those arrows are LIT
[2:07:02] <JeedyJay> You should switch around the arrow and bow hands.
[2:07:03] <alrobot2014> in ff5 they aren't
[2:07:04] <+LogothX> Why is Rosa's sprite black but her portrait is white
[2:07:04] <TheBlankAce> Move Cid to the back since he's dead weight now
[2:07:05] <+badchoice5> You ever get stuck in group fighting an existential evil with a girl you like, but she's into Chad? That's rough Kain
[2:07:08] <+linSP> aren't lances spears? 🤔
[2:07:12] <%Ciphris> kain is just super strong
[2:07:14] <%AbnormalVoid> What about Lance in Monster Hunter?
[2:07:15] <%Keyd00d> is pat wrong
[2:07:18] <%supersugoisenpai1> Paige and Pat voice acting at its finest
[2:07:22] <+Superstarsage> Kain uses both hands to masturbate
[2:07:24] <SomersaultJustice> shouldn't bow be left hand and arrows be right?
[2:07:26] <Copperama> I'm definitely hearing star wars in this song...
[2:07:26] <MoulesFritz> @PeachSaliva swtich bow and arrow hands
[2:07:27] <inz0mbiac> Kain follows Monster Hunter Lance rules
[2:07:28] <AncelDeLambert> Lance in MonHun is ridicu strong
[2:07:29] <fairore> how many people in the chat are left handed
[2:07:31] <+LogothX> Lancers could use shields, I'm 90% sure
[2:07:32] <%krawtch> dragoons prob practice so much they can one hand it
[2:07:34] <+BringBackSempai> nah put kain in the back and have him use jump
[2:07:35] <wsintai> @linSP Not all spears are lances; but all lances are spears
[2:07:38] <%leirazamzam> there was just a lot of sprite/portrait colour inconsistencies back in the day for whatever reason
[2:07:40] <alrobot2014> in ff5 and ff6 you could dual wield lances
[2:07:43] <tacostarvedbeast> Tactics had a skill for holding two handed weapons in one hand right?

[2:10:17] <SomersaultJustice> someone tweet her the hyadain remix of this song
[2:10:20] <seniorwhiteface> You should try spooky's house of Jumpscares seems perfect for you.
[2:10:21] <MoulesFritz> @PeachSaliva rosas bow and arrow are in the wrong hands dangit
[2:10:26] <+king_wragles> She could stream that one Slenderman game, it wasn't bad iirc
[2:10:31] <@MelBrooksKA> Kain Jump Good
[2:10:32] <AncelDeLambert> Portal 2 has been moved to an earlier time slot
[2:10:37] <The_Esquana> outlast?
[2:10:37] <+gralho> play tales of borderlands
[2:10:38] <%Keyd00d> pata pootee
[2:10:42] <tacostarvedbeast> @peachsaliva I bet it was about how you give stock answers to questions you get a lot
[2:10:44] <Estuko> seeing Kain in Duodecime and hearing him speak was orgasmic.
[2:10:47] <%krawtch> they get hard
[2:10:50] <Aeonknight_87> Fucking Cover ftw
[2:10:50] <$Agami23> albino lullyby seems like a good one. if only it was finished.
[2:10:55] <MoulesFritz> yes
[2:10:59] <Aeonknight_87> Cecil MVP
[2:11:03] <+BringBackSempai> yes she is a lefty
[2:11:03] <filialpails> arrows in dominant hand
[2:11:03] <%Remery_> Impure Lefties
[2:11:07] <JeedyJay> She's right-handed, but you're supposed to put the bow in the off-hand, and the arrows in the main hand.
[2:11:09] <pabloelenano2> @PeachSaliva scp containment breach its a good spooky game but its a bit hard and you may not like mazes
[2:11:09] <DirtyDeedsDunDirtCheap> @peachsaliva Pat, on the subject of gadgets, what’s your thoughts on attack options that are less direct like the gadgets but look FREAKIN STYLISH
[2:11:11] <%GeneralSCPatton> @somersaultjustice Woo! A fellow hyadain connoisseur!
[2:11:15] <Rhinoprotoss> You have to remember party member's dominant hand?
[2:11:17] <+BringBackSempai> but it doesn't matter for this fight because she is on heal duty
[2:11:18] <BaronVonProlix> only SATAN uses his left hand
[2:11:25] <Laironx3> PEEP
[2:11:28] <MoulesFritz> @PeachSaliva right-handed, but arrows go in the dominant hand
[2:11:29] <Graxe_> Man, I forgot that Barbariccia was called Valvalis.
[2:11:29] <%Keyd00d> IT'S FINE SHE DID IT
[2:11:35] <deviljhojho94> WOMAN SLAUGHTERED
[2:11:38] <+badchoice5> Wow for how hard the ship was, that was really easy
[2:11:43] <AncelDeLambert> Elbow Drops ftw
[2:11:47] <JeedyJay> @PeachSaliva You're supposed to put the arrows in the main hand, and the bow in the off-hand.
[2:11:51] <%Ciphris> you typically pull the bow string with the dominant hand
[2:11:51] <AncelDeLambert> Unending dragoon elbow drops
[2:11:56] <%krawtch> she cant play SCP she will break her neck, wrists, back, legs and hips if she does
[2:11:58] <TerraWraith> yay, more women murder
[2:12:01] <+smargh1015> RUBICANTE
[2:12:03] <deviljhojho94> Vulvarella
[2:12:04] <Copperama> Ya don't need to be optimal to beat this game, it Final Fantasy, the thing that matters most of all is levels, you can't get too clever...
[2:12:04] <+FrostMass22> Nightmare slain
[2:12:05] <Kaitepaints> @peachsaliva please don’t stop singing
[2:12:11] <%leirazamzam> I love rubicante
[2:12:13] <Aeonknight_87> Sorry paige, I wasn't yelling at you to cover. I kind of forgot this is live, used to catching these on VOD's

[2:12:18] <Kaitepaints> Thank you
[2:12:19] <+spookyskelletman> Hes so glamourous
[2:12:20] <%Keyd00d> barbarossa
[2:12:22] <+BringBackSempai> Rubicante is the best
[2:12:23] <GreatestGuess> Woooooooow
[2:12:24] <%rabiddragon2299> you could play hidden agenda, it's made by the same people who made until dawn
[2:12:25] <$SleepyMaribo> why didnt she use exit when she was kidnapped?
[2:12:27] <+badchoice5> I love seeing characters use stuff like Exit in story context
[2:12:28] <BestTeaMaker> I have tweeted the Hyadain cover at paige
[2:12:28] <Kaitepaints> It’s the voice of a goddess
[2:12:29] <pabloelenano2> @krawtch im pretty sure she will use a mask for that game or see a doctor
[2:12:40] <$KnivesEve> paige dont stop the music
[2:12:42] <reonome> PLAY DETROIT
[2:12:43] <+BringBackSempai> he's the Sagat of this game
[2:12:47] <AncelDeLambert> Don't stop me now, I'm having such a good time
[2:12:47] <%SulfurousAcid> Doki Doki Literature Club
[2:12:52] <Graxe_> All of the four fiends in FF4 come from Dante's Inferno. So they're Italian or Latin in origin.
[2:12:57] <+cvp5127> play danganronpa
[2:12:59] <SatansDick1> doki doki is spoky
[2:13:03] <MoulesFritz> play dmc2
[2:13:07] <%Keyd00d> play everything except the suggestions
[2:13:10] <+king_wragles> Doki Doki is fucking NUTS
[2:13:12] <Copperama> Literature club is pretty pointless unless it's blind...
[2:13:17] <+Superstarsage> NANI?
[2:13:25] <Estuko> @Copperama pretty much
[2:13:29] <+BringBackSempai> david bowie?
[2:13:30] <%NWR_James> so MANY crystals
[2:13:31] <fairore> @cvp5127 for October ?
[2:13:37] <MoulesFritz> DDLC goes downhill when it becomes about meta horror
[2:13:42] <Delsin7Pony> hidden crystals boys
[2:13:43] <MoulesFritz> hot takearoonie
[2:13:45] <TheJadedDragon> Time for Side B
[2:13:49] <%Keyd00d> the SUPER dragon balls
[2:13:49] <Aeonknight_87> Literally
[2:13:52] <+badchoice5> UNDERGROUND!?
[2:13:57] <Laironx3> Sonic Underground
[2:13:58] <BaronVonProlix> LITERALLY THO
[2:13:59] <RichAnvils> Diggahol
[2:14:01] <CactusCommando> golbez did nothing wrong
[2:14:02] <%NWR_James> the underside
[2:14:04] <%SaltyDongs> they came from underground
[2:14:05] <%SchroedingersFerret> Their mother will be found
[2:14:05] <+badchoice5> WE HAVE TO GET BACK TO SPACE
[2:14:06] <hntronium> DIG DOWN STUPID
[2:14:06] <%Keyd00d> shade thrown on cid

[2:14:07] <RichAnvils> i'm addicted to Diggahol
[2:14:12] <+SeroSedLaeto> A Hind D?
[2:14:12] <$Agami23> the reverse side of the world? what is this, fate/??
[2:14:14] <SomersaultJustice> Cid: Dig up, stupid!
[2:14:16] <$BuoyantSoul> Metal Gear???
[2:14:17] <Copperama> The initial twist of literature club is super good, then... it tries to be meta, and is kind of embarrassing...
[2:14:19] <+smargh1015> oh no that's where the dirty drow and dueregar lives
[2:14:21] <hntronium> ITS A SHOVEL
[2:14:22] <%SuperCasualBoom> cheer200 I going to tell you this now. But your next battle of Golbez, when a certain green lady comes back to the party, time Kain jump right before her return and if timed right, he won’t get hit by instant death shot and the fight will be easier.
[2:14:22] <%Keyd00d> THAT place
[2:14:24] <PakuV2> we undertale
[2:14:24] <+BringBackSempai> drop it down the dark souls 2 well
[2:14:25] <Graxe_> Underground and the moon mentioned at the same time.
[2:14:26] <tacostarvedbeast> I’m just waiting for pat to call cecil Adam Sessler
[2:14:30] <EMP_Ike_Turner> Yuri best girl
[2:14:32] <BaronVonProlix> Second floor basement?
[2:14:37] <%NWR_James> Kain sounds like a maniac
[2:14:41] <darthravel> yeah hot shorty duergar action
[2:14:44] <MoulesFritz> DDLC would be far more interesting without the twist and it was about depression
[2:14:51] <+RushUnplugged> did you say NERD?!?
[2:14:51] <+badchoice5> LEWD
[2:14:53] <grayjammer> pat

[2:15:22] <KilljoyHexx> fox girls PogChamp
[2:15:23] <+badchoice5> Wow, yeah that is probably a reused kitsune sprite from something else
[2:15:25] <%SuperCasualBoom> Why Paige talking like Dusty Rhodes...?
[2:15:26] <%Keyd00d> she'd be better
[2:15:29] <Rhinoprotoss> They all sleep in 1 bed
[2:15:35] <Graxe_> I bet Rosa would be fine having both Kain and Cecil at once.
[2:15:35] <BaronVonProlix> Were they ALL in the same bee??
[2:15:36] <CatmanIX> so you all slept in Cecil's bed? kinky
[2:15:45] <SomersaultJustice> it's like how I thought aerith had elf ears because of her bow
[2:15:48] <%Keyd00d> slumber party at cecil's
[2:15:48] <%NWR_James> @Rhinoprotoss don't kink-shame
[2:15:50] <Laironx3> Kitsune gals. TPcrunchyroll
[2:15:51] <KilljoyHexx> and at the point all the fox girl fans knew one another
[2:15:52] <Aeonknight_87> it's soon
[2:15:55] <+king_wragles> did she fix Rosa's setup?
[2:15:56] <%SuperCasualBoom> Soon
[2:15:58] <Estuko> @Graxe_ many would
[2:15:58] <GreatestGuess> They had an orgy in Cecil’s bed, to mourn Tellah
[2:16:00] <MoulesFritz> no
[2:16:01] <SirDogBear> to be fair everyone but yang probably had their own room in baron lol
[2:16:11] <+BringBackSempai> you can actually use the airship now
[2:16:11] <derap41> Pimping ride
[2:16:11] <SomersaultJustice> I hope she gets THAT GREEN PERSON today
[2:16:14] <+badchoice5> 4 dudes, 1 chick, 1 bed
[2:16:16] <%SuperCasualBoom> Time for Paige to find
[2:16:21] <+badchoice5> I saw a video like that once
[2:16:26] <%krawtch> comfortable bellows
[2:16:30] <BaronVonProlix> SCREAMLORDS
[2:16:32] <fairore> paige should play outlast for October

[2:16:55] <+BringBackSempai> Edgelord castle, literally
[2:16:55] <%Mekhet09> That game is fucked.
[2:17:03] <Aeonknight_87> Incoming Mad Ogres in a chest
[2:17:05] <%Mekhet09> Even for mobile games it's super greedy.
[2:17:05] <%SuperCasualBoom> A little strong
[2:17:12] <Mrbaconator> @PeachSaliva when is the next portal 2 stream
[2:17:13] <+BringBackSempai> where the Edgelords at

[2:17:49] <MoulesFritz> SUPERSTAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAR
[2:17:50] <GreatestGuess> I haven’t played this game in like, 18 years and I remember it surprisingly well.
[2:17:51] <+badchoice5> Just fly to the moon!
[2:17:55] <SephytheOWA> he is super late to the party
[2:17:56] <%GarbageNirvana> So he's like a reverse Aerith
[2:17:56] <+smargh1015> voiced by Talisen jaffe in the ds remake
[2:18:00] <+BringBackSempai> his story is probably the darkest part of this game
[2:18:01] <Shinmaddrox> What is your thoughts on FFIV: The After Years?
[2:18:03] <%commanderclaw> @PeachSaliva In the GBA FFIV, Everyone gets more development in their own personal dungeon
[2:18:06] <+BringBackSempai> also his name is EDGE
[2:18:06] <SirDogBear> but when he does join he there for rest of game so thats nice
[2:18:07] <deviljhojho94> Hey who is gonna play catherine full body? Keepo

[2:18:53] <TheMilhouseExperience> Too bad SE lost the code forever.
[2:18:53] <+BringBackSempai> FFIV After Years was a mistake, its nothing but trash

[2:57:44] <BaronVonProlix> Will yang ever live again?
[2:57:48] <JGardner88> What's a good FF to get into? I played everything from 12 and forward since im a newcomer
[2:58:01] <%SulfurousAcid> 6
[2:58:03] <TheJadedDragon> FF6
[2:58:06] <%clifin> 6
[2:58:09] <+badchoice5> Only in the stupid remake
[2:58:09] <+Fenrirlives> PAT WHEN SPODERMAN?
[2:58:10] <gustavozxd> @jgardner88 6 or 7
[2:58:13] <$Agami23> ff5
[2:58:14] <+badchoice5> everyone lives in the remake
[2:58:26] <+Hinasil> @JGardner88 If you already played 13 you've played the best
[2:58:36] <gustavozxd> doodStare
[2:58:39] <Rhinoprotoss> FF6 is old
[2:58:41] <TheJadedDragon> You hush your mouth with 13.
[2:58:43] <%SaltyDongs> man spider
[2:58:43] <$lotharrio> @JGardner88 FF6 is probably the best of the early ones. FF4 is a tighter story, in some sense, but it plays like a Dragon Quest.
[2:58:44] <%GeneralSCPatton> cheer100 cheer100 Yang is going to be ripe by the time you stream again.
[2:58:46] <+nanitchi> UR SO CUTE PEACH
[2:58:51] <JGardner88> Fuck me FF13 is my favorite
[2:58:53] <fireking900> @Rhinoprotoss ur old
[2:58:58] <%Keyd00d> play 4 first
[2:59:00] <Rhinoprotoss> I'm a child
[2:59:05] <SomersaultJustice> ff6 is probably the best beginner one since it's easy and good
[2:59:10] <JGardner88> FF13 Saga was my favorite guess I hit peak FF experience
[2:59:10] <Caidezes> Bye Pat feet!
[2:59:11] <fireking900> an old child
[2:59:13] <mikesrsly> Viera boots
[2:59:23] <+Hinasil> @JGardner88 Play 9 though, it's very good
[2:59:27] <TheJadedDragon> I can differentiate good games from favorites.
[2:59:29] <+badchoice5> You did the good job Paige
