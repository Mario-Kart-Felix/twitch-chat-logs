[0:58:00] <element_of_loyalty> WATER SPELL IS A BONUS
[0:58:01] <+badchoice5> I can't believe you are making us watch a third run of a David Cage game
[0:58:02] <echodrone81> the noise?
[0:58:02] <%AncelDeLambert> DEPOSIT IN ME, BELOVED
[0:58:02] <TheFilth> Pat would lose the fight with the microwave
[0:58:02] <SmoothEnigma> this IS THE THIRD IMPACT
[0:58:06] <+cereal_box_conspiracy> make the noise before she gets back
[0:58:09] <%ProbablyOwl> Will the noise just be Pat screaming/moaning
[0:58:10] <%NWR_James> That's love
[0:58:13] <+NightOwlSam> ze bad game
[0:58:13] <yendoria> Piss fetishes are NOT okay

[0:58:16] <Mr_Strut> Yo when's Indigo Prophecy?
[0:58:16] <DreamerTTV> where's Liam?
[0:58:16] <echodrone81> @smoothenigma it all returns to nothing
[0:58:17] <DatAsuna> SMH, no secret junk food as soon as she leaves
[0:58:17] <%Saggitori> @peachsaliva pat, she wants to bone optimus primal. of course she would save the microwave
[0:58:19] <$Mendin> @PeachSaliva Hey Pat did the guy ever get the David Cage tattoo since the Best Friends gave the game their Approval?
[0:58:20] <talisign> @NWR_James is it?
[0:58:20] <kumokalt> I hope she kills the abusive dad
[0:58:24] <%Shonen_hero> and it pays off later
[0:58:25] <On_Target> i got a free rental code from RedBox the day Detroit came out and played it all in one day
[0:58:27] <SatansDick1> at least its not a second playthrough of omikron
[0:58:27] <+walternatorz> pat, is paige aware of public opinion jokes?
[0:58:28] <element_of_loyalty> wash hands
[0:58:29] <+ryujinran> Paige‚Äôs playthrough will probably be the most successful
[0:58:30] <Zeikier> no kill dad
[0:58:31] <%Unity028> that was a fast pee
[0:58:32] <XDmaniac> I swear the moment she misses blatant things in the foreground im gonna start dying, start writing my eulogy
[0:58:32] <mercado94> @PeachSaliva Pat did you see that the Witcher autor is demanding more royalties from CD Proyect?
[0:58:32] <FracturedImage> Omikron 2nd Gig when?
[0:58:33] <On_Target> whixh was probably not the best experience
[0:58:34] <+gralho> And i got to see feet moon2W
[0:58:35] <+badchoice5> Or that good
[0:58:37] <+AmaniIsYourBoss> Remember Pat, it could've been Omikron. Anytime some fucked up shit happens, always remember that it's not Omikron.
[0:58:38] <deviljhojho94> this is the best Cage game. Not that means too high a praise
[0:58:38] <$serpenttucker> wat
[0:58:38] <$wolfofsound> and fat evil
[0:58:40] <%Djinnazz> @PeachSaliva We heard you peeing.

[0:58:47] <echodrone81> fat evil ü§£
[0:58:48] <$brave_sj> Paige is gonna be a lowkey robot racist in the future. Like not outright picketing to ban robots, but crossing the street when she sees a robot approaching
[0:58:48] <%Unity028> I KNEW IT
[0:58:48] <LifesNeverHumDrum> @semiconductive same man. this game just put me to sleep. i hate to say i miss the stupid of the wall shit but at least it's not at boring that way
[0:58:50] <redwilt> Pat Do the Death From Robit Sad Story
[0:58:51] <DreamerTTV> Pat's kinda thicc
[0:58:52] <Damashi_The_Kaotic> Its not about race though Pat

[0:59:21] <missingangle> Tales of the Borderlands, tho
[0:59:21] <Zeikier> well yeah, tho that's pretty unfair cuz TWD Season 1 is a really good story
[0:59:21] <+NightOwlSam> concept art for this, alice looks like CLem
[0:59:21] <On_Target> 2012
[0:59:22] <DesuDesuDokiDoki> the only one that made money
[0:59:23] <ape_hawk> 2012

[0:59:25] <$mandragoraroot> telltale FeelsBadMan
[0:59:26] <GoldeNOVA> I like Detroit better than TWD S1
[0:59:27] <+Noxybaru> Walking Dead is overrated tbh
[0:59:27] <%Sinister_Aglet> oh man I got really confused and thought they were talking about the tv show
[0:59:29] <redwilt> Zis game has no connections to holocaust
[0:59:29] <+mmSoTasty> paige did you know about [big spoiler]? you can only do it if you [big spoiler]!
[0:59:31] <$brave_sj> Yeah, Season 1 had a small child I cared about. Cage has yet to accomplish this
[0:59:31] <+PipIV> we're talking f-ing Lee
[0:59:34] <ImmaCanuck> No more Wolf Among Us Season 2 BibleThump
[0:59:34] <%Unity028> twd s1 is so good
[0:59:43] <+cereal_box_conspiracy> Telltale sucks, their games suck, and ya'll are just pretending TWD is good because people lost their job.
[0:59:44] <+PipIV> he cast a spell on me
[0:59:44] <AgentJin> @Solidnick18 Hey pal! <3 agentjHi
[0:59:46] <+Ilpala271> @ImmaCanuck Hurts so much
[0:59:48] <TheGershon> Shouldn't such a big budget game of that nature have a chance to be as good?
[0:59:48] <echodrone81> tales from the borderlands is the best
[0:59:49] <Zeikier> Detroit could have been better but it still has its moments
[0:59:49] <+CaptainJax> that was like 2012, i remember being in high school still
[0:59:52] <Luesagna00> @peachsaliva walking dead is stupidly overrated
[0:59:57] <TheFilth> I always assume you're drunk
[0:59:58] <@MelBrooksKA> Cage has been doing this since 1999
[0:59:59] <%Unity028> nah you dumb cereal TWD S1 was good
[1:00:02] <Damashi_The_Kaotic> TWD Season 1 and 4 are so damn good...shame it'll never be finished thanks to poor management at Telltale
[1:00:03] <+BoboDaHobo> the walking dead is overhyped
[1:00:05] <element_of_loyalty> NO
[1:00:05] <Zeikier> the show TWD is especially stupidly overratd
[1:00:09] <Paradocks23> Hair of dog

[1:01:27] <Mr_Strut> You can eve slow time
[1:01:27] <DracaenaLeaf> just slow down time and save a lot, I hate time based things but MM is fine
[1:01:28] <element_of_loyalty> PAT WASH
[1:01:30] <%SSaryn> For some reason I always forget Paige gets anxiety super easily for seemingly no reason...
[1:01:34] <+yet_another_brony> majoras masks time limit can be managed with a schedule
[1:01:35] <ToneBacas> the time pressure obgSoon obgSoon obgSoon obgSoon
[1:01:36] <LifesNeverHumDrum> Paige gets nervous around stopwatches
[1:01:38] <Zeikier> the time limit is repeatable and mostly just event flags relax

[1:01:43] <swyvar> @PeachSaliva You know that being nervous about wasting time makes you waste more time, right?

[1:02:55] <+NightOwlSam> kara can die in her 2nd chapter with todd
[1:02:56] <ToneBacas> will you be uploading this suffer-through to youtube later?
[1:02:56] <+badchoice5> Paige is a strong, independent gamer girl who don't need no hand-holding except for all those times
[1:02:58] <Mythundare> This game can definitely go down "not fun" routes
[1:03:05] <Mr_Strut> We now require fanart of Pat and Paige engaging in lewd handholding.
[1:03:14] <+NightOwlSam> i hope she has kara meet ralph

[1:17:22] <baronvonkame> @PeachSaliva you know, not that woolie and the other guys' opinions don't matter, but it'll be ineteresting hearing your opinion when this harps very heavilly on AMERICAN civil rights

[1:17:49] <twistedj3ster> androids are stealing racisim
[1:17:50] <$ScallyCapt> if all the androids are at the back of the bus, wouldnt the rear suspension be all fucked up constantly?
[1:17:54] <laserbeaming> <fake deleted comment>
[1:17:56] <%zal_silverfang> @Noxybaru cause then they would have mass taxes to buisnesses to pay those unemployed people just so they can survive effectively taking the cash that would be spent on workers out of the buisnesses. that is why this whole scenarios wouldnt work

But it's not from some shitty hormonal imbalance or a boo hoo me, mine was born of cold logic, years or self inflection and philosophical debate. I've been tired the way an 80 year old is tired since i was 12-14. My crime was existing, and my punishment is more existence. God i love it. Ain't no suffering like vague semi-existencial suffering, for it is proof that i exist.

[3:41:30] <On_Target> @xXCrustybunsXx why does this dump even exist? you'd think android parts would be super valuable
[3:41:31] <CrypticMochi> Find the new PEEN!
[3:41:31] <%AncelDeLambert> @xXCrustybunsXx with all the jobless people? YES
[3:41:36] <RickSaintRiot> For instance, how am i gonna stop some mean blue-haired robo-whore from tearing me a structurally superfluous new behind?
[3:41:36] <On_Target> especially the blue blood

[3:44:23] <On_Target> who set this up? a bored garbageman?
[3:44:28] <michelangelostark> don't you just love this SUBTLE METAPHOR OF THE SAVIOR ESCAPING FROM THE UNDERWORLD WITH NEW KNOWLEDGE?
[3:44:29] <buffmurffy> you all mean the movie repulsion, right?
[3:44:29] <ImmaCanuck> So is this robot purgatory or...
[3:44:29] <%SuperCasualBoom> Oh Jesus Oh lawd he a comin
[3:44:30] <leinadtonu> Marcus should get like ten arms...
[3:44:30] <Endocrom> Just a ton of compacted mud for no raisin
[3:44:32] <+mmSoTasty> that guy's like "haha yeah, it's great scaring other androids"
[3:44:33] <element_of_loyalty> YOINK
[3:44:34] <Rellim80> Labrynth
[3:44:35] <Mumblesthebumbler> one thousand fingers
[3:44:35] <Gruhunchously> Yeah, why does this place exist again.
[3:44:35] <talisign> Dance magic Dance
[3:44:37] <RickSaintRiot> it's been so long since Labyrinth for me
[3:44:37] <pakuman> Lol the legs
[3:44:38] <Zeikier> oh shit, other players
[3:44:39] <RickSaintRiot> Veta
[3:44:41] <alrobot2014> TL Note: VETA means life
[3:44:43] <+badchoice5> Even in the future, humanity refuses to recycle
[3:44:44] <Hydrapissed> I mean its ehhh pat
[3:44:45] <element_of_loyalty> EYES
[3:44:48] <TripleTRex> why aren't the androids harvested for parts or something
[3:44:50] <%Ell1ot> my favorite part in Dark Crystal was when that one bird guy went, "MMMMMMMMMM..."
[3:44:52] <sykehm> "hey frankie why dont we dig a weird ditch right here and shove a bunch of robots in on either side with their hands sticking out so they all grab at you when you crawl through" what? why? "theatre"
[3:44:53] <michelangelostark> I agreed with the execution but still heavy handed
[3:44:56] <+Hilleltaco> @Strigiform Furthermore why would they not recycle such valuable machines, they just dump em in a pit
[3:44:57] <+PipIV> which circle of hell is this?
[3:45:01] <talisign> You remind me of the babe.
[3:45:02] <Coystick> Yeah this is a great scene
[3:45:04] <%AncelDeLambert> My mileage is that the heavy handedness REALLY tonally destroys this scene for me
[3:45:06] <+Nomicro4u> "because it would be cool"
[3:45:07] <LifesNeverHumDrum> it's kinda not really cool tho when I've seen it before
[3:45:08] <element_of_loyalty> EYES EAR HEART
[3:45:11] <%AncelDeLambert> the angel is the worst part
[3:45:11] <Hydrapissed> also no way 8 grand android would not be recycled
[3:45:16] <Zzross_the_savagezz> @Bt_Robot Only Kratos did it multiple times, in multiple different venues; and it was almost always his fault.
[3:45:17] <%SuperCasualBoom> This must be Smash players territory
[3:45:20] <RickSaintRiot> well, the latin "v" is pronounced with a wuh sound
[3:45:20] <michelangelostark> @pipiv could be the last circle as it is dark as hell
[3:45:21] <Coystick> EAT YOUR FAMILY MARCUS, EAT THEM ALL
[3:45:22] <+Nomicro4u> HE GRAB
[3:45:23] <morat2255> If you don't kill someone, then this scene is a failure.
[3:45:27] <TikanZK> Theres a subreddit for "Awful Taste But Great Execution"
[3:45:28] <Gruhunchously> Veta actually means time
[3:45:29] <ImmaCanuck> JUMP SCARE! BOO!
[3:45:31] <RickSaintRiot> so it should be "Wey-tah"
[3:45:32] <element_of_loyalty> R1
[3:45:35] <LifesNeverHumDrum> this accidentally rips off a Teen Titans episode but in reverse
[3:45:38] <+mmSoTasty> yeah robo tiddy
[3:45:39] <RickSaintRiot> VETA MINUTE
[3:45:39] <+Nomicro4u> KILL
[3:45:40] <michelangelostark> @tikanzk i need this
[3:45:41] <TheMilhouseExperience> Markus went to Silent Hill. Which is fitting since it's now in the garbage. Thanks Konami. #FucKonami
[3:45:42] <+Nomicro4u> NOOOOOO
[3:45:42] <element_of_loyalty> KHALI MA
[3:45:43] <reonome> DO IT
[3:45:44] <%Sinister_Aglet> WILL PAIGE MURDER A WOMAN?
[3:45:45] <talisign> No, give me your organs
[3:45:45] <Zzross_the_savagezz> kill her
[3:45:46] <+Nomicro4u> COWARD
[3:45:47] <Gruhunchously> Paige is a coward.
[3:45:47] <+cvp5127> BOOOOO
[3:45:48] <element_of_loyalty> KILL
[3:45:48] <leinadtonu> LET ME EAT YOU, SO I CAN SAVE OUR KIND!
[3:45:48] <%Freelance7> COWARD
[3:45:48] <CptBritches> BOOOOOOOO
[3:45:51] <$Bt_Robot> GUN
[3:45:51] <reonome> BOOOOO
[3:45:54] <+badchoice5> How inefficient is this society that you can basically build a new robot from a garbage dump?
[3:45:55] <+NightOwlSam> NOW Murder
[3:45:57] <Ted_the_red> coward
[3:45:57] <Gameslayer2> You are too nice for us
[3:45:58] <Damashi_The_Kaotic> i've never seen this
[3:45:58] <element_of_loyalty> JESUS PEACH
[3:45:59] <%Kataguro> Robots aren't VVymyn confirmed
[3:45:59] <Zeikier> :c
[3:46:00] <+PipIV> Robo Battle Royale
[3:46:01] <$Bt_Robot> WOW
[3:46:01] <Hydrapissed> amd SHES DEAD!
[3:46:03] <+Nomicro4u> Left that robot to SUFFER ETERNALLY
[3:46:03] <Coystick> Cannibalize all these UNSOLD Vitas
[3:46:07] <%AncelDeLambert> Woolie, Second Son
[3:46:08] <%juxtest> You dont know what she did to get put in here! She might have eaten a baby!
[3:46:08] <morat2255> Murder her! Paige, kill the VVymyns!
[3:46:09] <CptBritches> Paige The Coward
[3:46:10] <%rdark_ksu> I want to live in the shit pit
[3:46:13] <DedlokPM> OKAY! WHO ARE YOU AND WHAT DID YOU DO TO OUR PAIGE!?!
[3:46:14] <chris_the_wiz_> they just wanna live
[3:46:14] <RickSaintRiot> she preferred to suffer than to die.
[3:46:14] <Gruhunchously> You'd think those Thirium junkies would be all over this place.
[3:46:15] <Hydrapissed> BOO time
[3:46:17] <michelangelostark> @badchoice5 this is the same society that will throw away their new iPhone for the new model the next year
[3:46:19] <+mmSoTasty> hello there!
[3:46:20] <CaptainKarite> Paige the good hero
[3:46:21] <+xXCrustybunsXx> It would be cool is the game was about a post-robo war and Conor was the intermediate for Human/Robot relations
[3:46:21] <DirtyDeedsDunDirtCheap> ....Can we not recycle all this shit or something?
[3:46:22] <element_of_loyalty> paige is weak
[3:46:23] <+Nomicro4u> BUT MURDERING THAT ONE IS OKAy
[3:46:24] <+skizzuto> time for heterochromia
[3:46:25] <+mmSoTasty> thanks for the eye!
[3:46:30] <Mumblesthebumbler> WEAK
[3:46:31] <EMP_Ike_Turner> SERVE ME YOUR EYE
[3:46:31] <%zal_silverfang> @badchoice5 same as the guys at jericho who dont run out to snatch some parts
[3:46:33] <%SuperCasualBoom> Paige kill the cywhores
[3:46:35] <element_of_loyalty> NOW ITS MINE
[3:46:35] <Estuko> women = humans =/= robots, so it's not women murder if she kills... so there's no point?
[3:46:35] <%Kravedarknesss> thousands of dollars in plastic and microchips just sitting in a hole in the ground
[3:46:38] <talisign> Paige seems to not like stealing organs
[3:46:39] <Gruhunchously> Paige saw a helpless female android and didn't kill her.
[3:46:39] <DedlokPM> PAIGE WOULD NEVER PASS UP A CHANCE TO KILL A VVYMMN!
[3:46:42] <+mmSoTasty> kill the gynoids
[3:46:44] <gyrogogozeppeli> ANIME MAN
[3:46:46] <CaptainKarite> He served you
[3:46:46] <MakeshiftSurgeon> Pretty cool how all these parts are plug and play compatible.
[3:46:47] <RickSaintRiot> @Nomicro4u the difference is clearly consciousness of the consequences.
[3:46:48] <michelangelostark> @dirtydeedsdundirtcheap people still throw away recyclable items in the garbage
[3:46:49] <%AncelDeLambert> JAPAN
[3:46:49] <DirtyDeedsDunDirtCheap> Heterochromia...great....
[3:46:49] <%JaydenSai> He's a jesus now!
[3:46:50] <element_of_loyalty> EAR
[3:46:50] <+polysyllabist> Funny how Marcus NEVER RETURNS to help the others
[3:46:51] <alrobot2014> how is it doing anything without being connected to any biocomponents
[3:46:51] <+cvp5127> a n i m e
[3:46:52] <sykehm> hey how come they can change skin and hair colour on command but not eyes
[3:46:52] <Coystick> A N I M E
[3:46:54] <Hydrapissed> go kill that dang woman now
[3:46:55] <%Kataguro> Markus is Arkham confirmed
[3:46:56] <kiramustdie26> He's just like Lady
[3:46:56] <element_of_loyalty> R2
[3:46:58] <Mr_Strut> Paige has gone deviant
[3:46:59] <LifesNeverHumDrum> tru anume
[3:47:01] <+badchoice5> If they are still functioning, this place must be a treasure trove of blue blood too
[3:47:06] <RickSaintRiot> The lady could still perceive her aliveness, the head could not.
[3:47:07] <DirtyDeedsDunDirtCheap> @michelangelostark Good point
[3:47:07] <michelangelostark> @dirtydeedsdundirtcheap heterochromia BECAUSE HE SEES THE PAST AND THE FUTURE
[3:47:09] <Coystick> Protag eyes
[3:47:10] <element_of_loyalty> Peach is CANNIBLESSED
[3:47:16] <buffmurffy> paige doesnt kill robot women because robot women cant get pregnant
[3:47:17] <%AncelDeLambert> @polysyllabist it's almost like David Cage never actually thought about this scene longer than it took him to write it
[3:47:20] <+Nomicro4u> INSERT
[3:47:27] <gyrogogozeppeli> Insert Kreygasm
[3:47:28] <@danzig2> no more tinnitus
[3:47:29] <DirtyDeedsDunDirtCheap> @michelangelostark ACROSS TIME AND SPACE
[3:47:30] <+PipIV> NEED MORE
[3:47:30] <element_of_loyalty> (orgasm)
[3:47:32] <side_effect> I love the sound when his audio comes into focus
[3:47:33] <leinadtonu> Get yourself some new nipples
[3:47:35] <Gruhunchously> How does David Cage even write?
[3:47:36] <EMP_Ike_Turner> mawp
[3:47:38] <+PipIV> GET IN ME
[3:47:39] <morat2255> Mawp!
[3:47:41] <Zeikier> mawp!
[3:47:41] <+G_Thunders> @hilleltaco Cyberlife doesn‚Äôt need the spare parts, was my impression. The company invented blue blood space magic out of nothing, so they‚Äôre gonna be just fine.
[3:47:41] <element_of_loyalty> EAR RAPE
[3:47:43] <$wolfofsound> MAWP
[3:47:43] <talisign> @AncelDeLambert Second drafts aren't how true artists work.
[3:47:44] <%rdark_ksu> yea he doesnt need a new chest or anything like that which has been torn to shreds
[3:47:48] <Zzross_the_savagezz> Maw mawp
[3:47:49] <michelangelostark> @side_effect where the execution done well comes in
[3:47:50] <DedlokPM> Ear insertion teenOOH
[3:47:52] <ImmaCanuck> lanipaLoud
[3:47:53] <Mumblesthebumbler> fuck yeah
[3:47:54] <sykehm> bad concept, great execution seems to me like a sign of david cage directing and a really great team doing all the actual work
[3:47:54] <element_of_loyalty> CLIMBER HEART
[3:47:57] <LifesNeverHumDrum> put it back
[3:47:58] <RickSaintRiot> why do they cut their hair if they can automatically change the length
[3:47:59] <%zal_silverfang> @badchoice5 probably not all that good and partly used up of its function, given if it has to be somewhat regularly replaced, but still would be better then nothing. dirty water better then no water
[3:47:59] <KahtaLzargo> Strepp Throat and fever have me up. Glad there‚Äôs a stream to listen too :)
[3:48:07] <gyrogogozeppeli> "heart"
[3:48:08] <On_Target> once you get the regulator your chest just kind of "heals" itself
[3:48:10] <MissMalisin> WutFace
[3:48:12] <michelangelostark> @kahtalzargo aww feel better!
[3:48:13] <element_of_loyalty> HIM
[3:48:14] <Gruhunchously> How does this stuff go through conception, editing, scripting, acting without someone pointing out how dumb it is?
[3:48:19] <$Bt_Robot> YOUR THURIUM PUMP, GIVE IT TO ME, NOW!
[3:48:19] <+Nomicro4u> yay
[3:48:19] <sykehm> he needs a heart, brain and courage
[3:48:20] <%GarbageNirvana> If Paige only had a heart
[3:48:21] <element_of_loyalty> elmo
[3:48:22] <CrimsonSkeletons> What, Remember Me?
[3:48:22] <rosemon5001> @PeachSaliva was it the same for you fighting in the mustard pits?
[3:48:24] <gyrogogozeppeli> Take from them everything, Markus
[3:48:27] <CptBritches> HONK HONK
[3:48:29] <+xXCrustybunsXx> The robots are like bionicols with how easy they can repair themselves
[3:48:31] <+skizzuto> apatWink apatWink apatWink he screm
[3:48:34] <RickSaintRiot> @Gruhunchously i assume they get paid not to criticize.
[3:48:35] <+PipIV> No mercy
[3:48:35] <lesserkarl> ITCH
[3:48:39] <element_of_loyalty> repeal n replace
[3:48:39] <LifesNeverHumDrum> @gruhunchously they do but when you have a narcissist running the show it doesn't matter
[3:48:41] <grayjammer> BABYS WAVIN‚Äô‚Äô!!
[3:48:44] <alrobot2014> these robots are nowhere near as cool as bionicles
[3:48:44] <RickSaintRiot> bite the hands that feed, etc.
[3:48:48] <element_of_loyalty> meow
[3:48:48] <michelangelostark> @gruhunchously tell that to big budget movies from big production companies. it happens when there's.. Too many cooks!
[3:48:49] <gyrogogozeppeli> Why is this robot graveyard even a thing?
[3:48:51] <+Hilleltaco> You know, the ease with which he just snaps on parts just further begs the question why they're trashing all this stuff. This stuff is so modular that you could fix tons of other androids
[3:48:57] <+mmSoTasty> what if he had to steal robo blood
[3:49:00] <element_of_loyalty> NEW BALLS
[3:49:01] <gyrogogozeppeli> This seems like a massive waste of space and parts
[3:49:04] <+mmSoTasty> like drain a victim and drink
[3:49:05] <%AncelDeLambert> CLIMB OUT OF HADES
[3:49:06] <LifesNeverHumDrum> @hilleltaco cuz racism
[3:49:08] <DirtyDeedsDunDirtCheap> Wow those arms back there are fucking freaky
[3:49:11] <RickSaintRiot> it really is a huge waste.
[3:49:12] <srkAres> cant climb the slope if you cant hear
[3:49:13] <Hydrapissed> why arnt they crushing them?
[3:49:15] <+coolthulhuu> this scene is the pinnacle of style over substance
[3:49:16] <%Kravedarknesss> how does the skin grow back. if its self repairing then why can't he fix his broken parts
[3:49:16] <+xXCrustybunsXx> If my robots dont look like robots why should I care
[3:49:19] <michelangelostark> @gyrogogozeppeli why are car graveyards a thing?
[3:49:20] <RickSaintRiot> and the water and mud is getting all up in the parts.
[3:49:21] <Hydrapissed> why are they just letting them crawl around?
[3:49:26] <morat2255> Drink the drugs from their veins.
[3:49:29] <katocrimson> rise from your grave
[3:49:31] <$ImasukyLomae> Vita means life
[3:49:31] <+Nomicro4u> I love the robot that tries to climb but keeps falling
[3:49:32] <Gruhunchously> Look at those other poor androids trying to climb out as well.
[3:49:33] <%AncelDeLambert> press the buttons HEROICALLY
[3:49:33] <%SuperCasualBoom> Woolie... it was a slope *dies*
[3:49:33] <element_of_loyalty> SEE YA SUCKERS
[3:49:34] <Endocrom> Skin is just a hologram
[3:49:34] <alrobot2014> the android hears...then it sees
[3:49:34] <LifesNeverHumDrum> no guys gotta have muh Holocaust imagery
[3:49:38] <VritraReiRei> Missed Tech Demo Lady :(
[3:49:40] <Warfey> AngelThump
[3:49:41] <+cvp5127> wise fwom youw gwave
[3:49:41] <leinadtonu> Maybe this is just a super wasteful society and they don't give a fuck
[3:49:42] <alrobot2014> that's why it needs ears
[3:49:42] <Hydrapissed> From the head
[3:49:43] <michelangelostark> @kravedarknesss skin is a covering, ears are actual electronics
[3:49:46] <+Nomicro4u> in robot heeeeeeeellllll
[3:49:47] <%rdark_ksu> the ascention
[3:49:51] <michelangelostark> @leinadtonu so america?
[3:49:51] <%zal_silverfang> @Hilleltaco at the very least salvage enough parts to make 1/3 or 1/4 of the robots operational which is still good
[3:49:51] <LifesNeverHumDrum> he downloaded a soundtrack
[3:49:51] <$ImasukyLomae> 3 days and he raises
[3:49:52] <CrimsonSkeletons> Speaking of racism, jeez.
[3:49:54] <talisign> Reminder that Jericho didn't just raid the dump because they were scared. Its literally the earthbenders from Shamalan's Avatar.
[3:49:54] <$wolfofsound> @michelangelostark most of those are used to repair other vehicles. you find parts from the junkyards
[3:49:54] <Zeikier> As I walk through the valley of the shadow of death
[3:49:55] <On_Target> here comes the dumbest part of all
[3:49:56] <element_of_loyalty> F U DAVID CAGE
[3:49:58] <RickSaintRiot> it'd be one thing if these were all cheap, but they're so expensive
[3:49:59] <gyrogogozeppeli> @michelangelostark but cars arent scarce. Androids seems like theyre a very highly needed commodity.
[3:50:00] <%AncelDeLambert> here it comes
[3:50:01] <side_effect> convenient trenchcoat ahead LUL
[3:50:04] <CptBritches> COOL JACKET TIME BOYS

[3:50:20] <+mmSoTasty> "I have risen"
[3:50:21] <Mumblesthebumbler> Why doesn't cage make a physiological horror game? I think it would end up cool
[3:50:24] <AlasterAngelo> we truly are detroit become human
[3:50:24] <lesserkarl> cop walks by, shoots him again
[3:50:24] <Zeikier> DESHAW: BECOME SHANK

[3:50:46] <LifesNeverHumDrum> this sounds so much like a track from Prince of Egypt.... which.... makes sense i guess cuz Markus is Moses
[3:50:47] <$ImasukyLomae> it's stupid
[3:50:47] <Coystick> He's scanning for higbh power levels

[3:53:46] <element_of_loyalty> BITCH
[3:53:48] <Gruhunchously> She really isn't a magical minority though.
[3:53:50] <awsomesaucekirby> cheer232 My room is in the attic, and has no natural ventilation, so it's hotter than a professional squat thruster's taint in here. Probably just get a lawn chair from my aunt's garage, bugs be damned. I've been getting spider bites every night in my own bed anyway, so at least i don't have to worry about rolling over and crushing the sweet little things.
[3:53:51] <crimsonharvest> She's actually the Devil's Advocate in this drama isn't she
[3:53:51] <DracaenaLeaf> she a bitch

[3:54:12] <michelangelostark> @estuko ....but shut up tho... seriously this game would've been better as a buddy cop game and its only Conners story line
[3:54:13] <Zeikier> "He was influenced by some weird bald goblin man"
[3:54:16] <sykehm> he already knows that
[3:54:17] <%AncelDeLambert> Oh no, the fake lady I dreamed up doesn't like me anymore

[3:55:05] <%AncelDeLambert> DYSFUNCTIONAL
[3:55:08] <DedlokPM> @Gruhunchously She is a dark skinned entity in a simulated world that knows about everything that happens outside of it. I would say she is a Magical Minority
[3:55:12] <$wolfofsound> HE DABS TOO MUCH
[3:55:16] <sykehm> "and i want to kiss him"
[3:55:17] <element_of_loyalty> HIS SON DIED FROM ANDROID

[3:55:22] <morat2255> Is zombie a minority?

[3:56:00] <+Nomicro4u> his son died because he wasn't an android
[3:56:00] <LifesNeverHumDrum> this is a weird conversation in retrospect, huh
