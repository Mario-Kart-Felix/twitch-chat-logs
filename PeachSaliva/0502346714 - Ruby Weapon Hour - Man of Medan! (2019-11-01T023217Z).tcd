[1:29:33] <%AmaniIsYourBoss> AmaniIsYourBoss subscribed with Twitch Prime. They've subscribed for 5 months, currently on a 1 month streak! Paige, you can't just ask Woolie to go in the right direction. This damages the Woolie.

[1:29:35] <wsintai> @PeachSaliva Girl there is not enough Xanax in the world to fix you
[1:29:36] <theog_rb> woollie has the worst control scheme
[1:29:36] <mrjohncarlton> Woolie has such poor handling
[1:29:37] <%QueequegTheater> @PeachSaliva You could play DS2, that'll be so much easier

[1:29:43] <SirFailsAlott> IMAGINE IF THE CONTROLS WERE INVERSE
[1:29:43] <Roz_Lynd> HI PAT
[1:29:44] <%g0atmeal> Why does Woolie simply not eat the other humans?
[1:29:44] <Atraxa> woolie is good at footsies, not general movement
[1:29:44] <dukenux> Woolie has a wide turn angle
[1:29:45] <gekizenbu> woolie has tank controls
[1:29:45] <Haarute> paige was just roleplaying as woolie it's fine
[1:29:46] <%vectorless_peon> WELCOME TO NOVEMBER MY GRAINS AND POTATOS CAME IN

[2:26:24] <SpicyCheeseNips> I would
[2:26:25] <Hydrapissed> pat is
[2:26:25] <Pompadourius> SEMEN DUNGEON
[2:26:27] <StarMechV> Little Big Adventure 1 and 2 were like the first games I ever played on a pc
[2:26:30] <+SamleyTimes> insane hops
[2:26:32] <CherrieVelvet> oh, you replaced the cricket bat with the knife
[2:26:34] <StarMechV> So glad pat sepai noticed me
[2:26:34] <GUNxSPECTRE> The lack of music is fucked up
[2:26:37] <kekuha> i want clemps and plague to show up as npcs
[2:26:38] <StarMechV> sempai*
[2:26:45] <%starotter70> @PeachSaliva See if they're in the kitchen
[2:26:46] <Hydrapissed> plague has to be in this
[2:26:51] <Hydrapissed> hes gana smell blood
[2:26:51] <Pompadourius> Let's not put Plague in, he'd make this game TOO scary.
[2:26:53] <%sleepy_coffee> Push the m button on the x. bone controller
[2:26:53] <hntronium> not in kitchen
[2:27:01] <%GabeSweetMan> I hope Plague is the final boss.
[2:27:01] <Sphincter_Spelunker> So if you had to explain this game to Woolie in fighting game terms, how would you do it?
[2:27:01] <StarMechV> The jumping sounds specially reminded me of the game XD
[2:27:02] <hntronium> he saved in kitchen
[2:27:03] <a_mad_dragon> except dinah
[2:27:03] <SpicyCheeseNips> Is Eli in this game? I hope he is.
[2:27:04] <$rdark_ksu> even with daina?
[2:27:09] <%SoFarFetched> But is someone in the kitchen with Dina?
[2:27:11] <%QueequegTheater> @PeachSaliva Theory: the Pat in the foyer is a clone and the king is Pat Prime
[2:27:11] <qaaj> This feels like it was made in Dreams
[2:27:13] <+SWFanatic> Its footsies
[2:27:16] <%starotter70> I mean the room off the kitchen
[2:27:17] <roofkie> plague was the thing chasing you with the spiderbro
[2:27:20] <Ethel9727> Plague should be building a fence as the map's edge
[2:27:21] <$Jack_of_No_Trades> Is this how Woolie really transitions between rooms? Im not sure Ive ever seen him do it before
[2:27:22] <VestigeOuroboros> plauge building a fence to block off out of bounds
[2:27:24] <GUNxSPECTRE> This is kinda like a more fleshed-out version of a Puppet Combo game
[2:27:29] <Hydrapissed> OOOO ur gana find plague near a fense
[2:27:31] <Derodek> iunno if this castle was made for Pat. The doors are made for humans to fit through

[3:08:41] <Fear_Ranjer> KING IS ALREADY IMMORTAL
[3:08:42] <%starotter70> YE YE YE
[3:08:43] <+Walopoh> Real Woolie quote
[3:08:44] <+Sovspot> are the main antagonists to this game matt and liam
[3:08:45] <+primax104> cool
[3:08:45] <MrNoobMcSalt> try root?
[3:08:46] <+SWFanatic> Woolie VS God
[3:08:46] <a_mad_dragon> dude just patiently waited for you to finish digging
[3:08:46] <%GabeSweetMan> Is that TOTALLY optional?
[3:08:47] <SpicyCheeseNips> OH SHIT
[3:08:47] <evbites> pat killed a baby
[3:08:48] <PrettyThickandStrongDyck> I mean wow
[3:08:49] <TwinBat> >they made this in 3 months
[3:08:50] <Youwereeatenbyalid> KILL THEM ALL PAT
[3:08:51] <Niney_Who> Alright, now you've hit a bit of confusion
[3:08:52] <0rond> ACHIEVED IMMORTALITY
[3:08:53] <Dr_Mooose> "it's not stealing if they're dead"
[3:08:54] <jiin6> Jesus game woolie
[3:08:58] <Niney_Who> Where else is the Lighthouse technicallyy yypointing?
[3:09:01] <KaseKaizer> monkaS
[3:09:05] <InugamiTheHound> this game>>>>> fallout 76
[3:09:09] <PrettyThickandStrongDyck> @sovspot who? /s
[3:09:10] <+Archphronimos> Sup nerds. This looks MUCH more like a "real" game than i expected...
[3:09:15] <+GraceTBM> it absolutely isn't stealing if they're dead
[3:09:16] <KaiserMario> @InugamiTheHound YES
[3:09:16] <iambqb> Who trashed my dead babies grave
[3:09:23] <%GabeSweetMan> I was expecting this to be like... 10 minutes.
[3:09:24] <weissguard> What if the TOILET is the King who already achieved immortality? LUL
[3:09:24] <evbites> ohhhhh
[3:09:26] <Niney_Who> It's Pointing Right
[3:09:28] <DedlokPM> @InugamiTheHound any game is >>>>>>> Fallout 76
[3:09:28] <Niney_Who> So
[3:09:30] <%GabeSweetMan> This is nuuuuutz.
[3:09:31] <Niney_Who> ANYWHERE right
[3:09:35] <Valdorick> ... Wait, check behind the waterfall?
[3:09:36] <Sphincter_Spelunker> Here lies Turok Shadowman
[3:09:36] <KaiserMario> Go back to Pat?
[3:09:44] <wsintai> @PeachSaliva Go back to the lighthosue and follow the light perhaps
[3:09:45] <Louie_Salmon> Is that weird Y shape a thing?
[3:09:48] <Monkeyweed21> BEHIND THE WATERFALL
[3:09:48] <$Dutchpotato> didn't Pat mention the waterfall?
[3:09:51] <Niney_Who> It's kinda Vague, that's why I'm helping
[3:09:52] <$Jack_of_No_Trades> So whole map
[3:09:59] <SlaughterBiscuit> I would've paid money for this game
[3:10:07] <0rond> yeah this is worth 3 bucks at least
[3:10:07] <Louie_Salmon> This ain't zelda
[3:10:18] <Niney_Who> Not the whole map Jack, just anywhere Right of the lighthouse
[3:10:20] <%QueequegTheater> It's better than zelda
[3:10:21] <Valdorick> And lo, did Woolie yeet himself off the highest waterfall in the castle of super beasts.
[3:10:29] <$Jack_of_No_Trades> I'd pay 3 not knowing the characters, 5 easy as a fan
[3:10:30] <KaiserMario> I think this is worth a solid 8,99
[3:10:31] <wulfsbane_jolt> Right of the map, got it
[3:10:34] <$Dutchpotato> PogChamp a whole 3 dollars
[3:10:44] <$cirocomic> What about the outcrop to the right of the lighthouse on the map?
[3:10:45] <Sphincter_Spelunker> oh no Pat. Look Out.
[3:10:46] <%goose_attack_almanac> This has a lot more effort and quality in it than those Anime Titty puzzle games that keep getting farted out onto Steam
[3:10:46] <Niney_Who> RIP
[3:10:47] <%GabeSweetMan> WHELP
[3:10:47] <terribleusername> LUL
[3:10:52] <$Dutchpotato> uh oh
[3:10:52] <waifoong98> LUL
[3:10:53] <%SoFarFetched> OH NO
[3:10:54] <lloyddboy> YOU DIED
[3:10:54] <SpicyCheeseNips> uh
[3:10:56] <%starotter70> Messin with
[3:10:56] <Ion_Laser> ...
[3:10:57] <SpicyCheeseNips> what
[3:10:58] <Dhurkst> @0rond I'd spend $5 without hesitation
[3:10:58] <+GraceTBM> that's a great fall animation
[3:10:59] <+wizard_of_diamonds> YOU WHAT
[3:11:00] <Valdorick> Eh, not like progress was made
[3:11:01] <Trash_leviathan> what
[3:11:01] <SquiglyBattleOpera> I can't believe Woolie's fuckin' dead
[3:11:01] <Niney_Who> He finally got Baptized
[3:11:05] <%nofestu2> F
[3:11:06] <%GabeSweetMan> Not dead... JUST TRAPPED
[3:11:06] <terribleusername> woolie can't swim
[3:11:07] <jiin6> Woolie deded
[3:11:07] <+OkamiDude15> and so woolie cast himself off the highest point in all of castle super beast
[3:11:08] <Ion_Laser> F
[3:11:10] <+Walopoh> Rip in piece
[3:11:10] <Broand> and thus, woolie yee'd his last haw
[3:11:11] <Fear_Ranjer> What happened???
[3:11:11] <SpicyCheeseNips> Oh good I thought you fell through the ground
[3:11:12] <bigstupidjellyfish1337> you killed woolie
[3:11:12] <%zamatermort> 1
[3:11:13] <+GraceTBM> baptized by gravity
[3:11:15] <Djinnazz> F
[3:11:17] <tigerfang86> OOOF
[3:11:19] <%arcaderabbit48> You dug up a grave tho
[3:11:26] <%SoFarFetched> well its from last save
[3:11:26] <Niney_Who> But Yeah, Anywhere in the Lighthouse's Beam essentially
[3:11:28] <%WheatlyXT> F
[3:11:29] <DedlokPM> @Fear_Ranjer fell into the water and drowned
[3:11:30] <+Walopoh> @PeachSaliva baptized by sink
[3:11:32] <%SoFarFetched> so they gotta dig the grave again I think
[3:11:32] <%QueequegTheater> @PeachSaliva Baptism is a Catholic thing, his family is 7th Day Adventist
[3:11:33] <Niney_Who> That's whyyy it's kinda vague
[3:11:33] <xeros720> ded woolz
[3:11:33] <0rond> there is no way woolie isn't baptized, his mom would baptize him for sure
[3:11:34] <$Jack_of_No_Trades> Text him and ask. It is only 2 am
[3:11:36] <+improbable42> the grave could have been a marker
[3:11:37] <Fear_Ranjer> Oh my god
[3:11:38] <+windsoc> a swamp babtism
[3:11:39] <%GabeSweetMan> Optional Grave Desecration
[3:11:41] <KaiserMario> Is she asking Woolie right now?
[3:11:44] <Youwereeatenbyalid> I...ok?
[3:11:46] <+JohnMarkley> Woolie's going to become one of those hook arm babies from Dante's Inferno when he dies :O
[3:11:47] <Personified134> @PeachSaliva Try burying the root?
[3:11:50] <+improbable42> to trigger something
[3:11:50] <Personified134> in the grave?
[3:11:54] <%g0atmeal> how do i fast forward
[3:11:59] <Trash_leviathan> that was a weird death animation
[3:12:04] <Sphincter_Spelunker> @g0atmeal get smoked
[3:12:06] <%SoFarFetched> so you take a nap,and hopefully you wake up in time LUL
[3:12:07] <+windsoc> i meant baptism but i'm glad ityped babtism
[3:12:07] <Aquaczaz> dang, still going? this game is impressively long
[3:12:09] <+thebonebard> are we putting a time cap on this stream or are we going to completion
[3:12:09] <+NWR_James> Follow.The.Beam
[3:12:11] <Youwereeatenbyalid> Center path i guess
[3:12:29] <Personified134> remember when the first trailer for this game claimed "Temper your expectations?"
[3:12:30] <%WheatlyXT> Redig the grave?
[3:12:39] <Personified134> Jokes on us, he pulled an Itsuno
[3:12:40] <%GabeSweetMan> EXPECTATIONS EXCEEDED
[3:12:42] <0rond> we still didn't get to the jump scare...
[3:12:46] <Sphincter_Spelunker> You've only played for 90 ish minutes
[3:12:47] <Aquaczaz> is this available to the public?
[3:12:48] <%QueequegTheater> @Personified134 that was a power move and a half
[3:12:51] <billyup00> they meant pat's temper
[3:12:52] <%GabeSweetMan> Yeah STILL no jump scare....
[3:12:53] <zerocruz> MAX ACT
[3:13:00] <0rond> he promised something and delivered more
[3:13:00] <PopulousNix> why is this so good?
[3:13:00] <Youwereeatenbyalid> He absolutely exceeded my expectations
[3:13:01] <%sleepy_coffee> Dude all memes are great that include the woolz
[3:13:01] <$mister___doctor> @aquaczaz ye
[3:13:02] <KaiserMario> Honestly, it's more enjoyable than something like Slenderman, this has more stuff going on
[3:13:07] <deadbeat34> If this game is a shitpost, it's an incredible, extensive, and elaborate one.
[3:13:10] <Aquaczaz> sick
[3:13:11] <wulfsbane_jolt> you started at midnight, so roughly two hours of good-ass content
[3:13:11] <RupanSen> the jumpscare is probably Pat screaming TANK CONTROLS
[3:13:14] <+NWR_James> don't touch pat's snake
[3:13:24] <billyup00> do touch the snake
[3:13:25] <DracaenaLeaf> Is that Pat when he had hair?
[3:13:25] <Youwereeatenbyalid> Root maybe?
[3:13:27] <absolute_cagemony> HOLT SHIT PAIGE GET ON THE FUCKIN BOAT
[3:13:31] <Sphincter_Spelunker> pat's spitting cobra
[3:13:33] <Personified134> stab the root
[3:13:37] <+Punchasaur> @peachsaliva how was your Halloween? mine was eventful. I saw an interstate bridge get closed down due to a chemical spill, someone walking a mini horse, and a prostitute rip off the door handle of a Popeye's Chicken
[3:13:40] <Youwereeatenbyalid> What? What boat?
[3:13:44] <Trash_leviathan> imagine if he decided too make a real game, he would be too powerful
[3:13:46] <NeroInfinite> What boat you dumbo?
[3:13:48] <%QueequegTheater> Kenny
[3:13:48] <Youwereeatenbyalid> Gut's Boat???
[3:13:51] <billyup00> kenny
[3:13:53] <%SoFarFetched> berserk reference I assume?
[3:13:55] <Zaphire_Saucypants> wonder if it's possible to put the root at the grave where you dug and bury it
[3:13:57] <RupanSen> Kenny Resurrection
[3:13:57] <KaiserMario> @PeachSaliva Should you bury the root at the grave?
[3:14:02] <%QueequegTheater> Kenny vs. Guts
[3:14:06] <waifoong98> but she just got the Boat arc Kappa
[3:14:09] <waifoong98> *off
[3:14:20] <%nofestu2> lit sipsipDab
[3:14:23] <silverira> the red monster stoped showing up
[3:14:32] <Youwereeatenbyalid> You both did really
[3:14:34] <Valdorick> CurseLit house
[3:14:35] <a_mad_dragon> is kurapika still on the boat?
[3:14:39] <%GabeSweetMan> Did those respawn??
[3:14:41] <MavMarsh> the lighthouse bullets respawn for some reason
[3:14:48] <billyup00> arya is that's for sure
[3:14:48] <$Dutchpotato> infinite bullets PogCHampc
[3:14:55] <Sphincter_Spelunker> Don't remind me of Berserk. It's even more depressing knowing how long other people have waited for that chapter
[3:14:55] <Niney_Who> It shines East.
[3:14:56] <+improbable42> yea
[3:14:56] <Valdorick> Kurapika is still ont he boat
[3:14:57] <Niney_Who> Door side
[3:14:58] <+NWR_James> shot of gin
[3:15:01] <$Jack_of_No_Trades> Still, unique art style in under served genre with actual improvements and compelling gameplay over 2 hours long so far is like stunning to me for 3 months of work. By that metric, this one person could make a silent hill length game in a year
[3:15:04] <%GabeSweetMan> Aura of DOOR
[3:15:07] <DatAsuna> wat
[3:15:09] <+improbable42> behind the light house
[3:15:13] <CherrieVelvet> infinite bullets
[3:15:14] <Valdorick> I think I figured it out... Togashi is reading Beserk, that's what's influencing his current arc.
[3:15:14] <Zaphire_Saucypants> nice
[3:15:17] <%GabeSweetMan> INFINITE BULLETS for INFINITE GUN
[3:15:23] <Youwereeatenbyalid> Unlimited bullet works
[3:15:24] <+improbable42> ??
[3:15:25] <%Roasted_Pheasant> thats a bug
[3:15:32] <zerocruz> Is Kurapika the protagonist now ?
[3:15:34] <billyup00> are there achievements?
[3:15:38] <Pompadourius> This is much better than "generic first person jumpscare" horror games of prior years.
[3:15:40] <Youwereeatenbyalid> Kill em all woolie
[3:15:54] <Ner234> Woolie with a GUN
[3:15:58] <$Fenrirlives> was that indent just it?
[3:15:59] <silverira> did you showed the root to pat?
[3:16:03] <%Jjrossman> yooooooooo
[3:16:05] <americashypest> just got here, what's the lore so far?

[3:46:40] <%sleepy_coffee> In the end we’re all the villain
[3:46:49] <+wandorx_x> was that a book on the ramparts?
[3:46:50] <Trash_leviathan> they got that key awhile ago @Blargimazombie
[3:46:53] <Broand> He has the silver feather so there is no fall damage
[3:46:56] <%QueequegTheater> @SpicyCheeseNips yes but they have the item that negates it
[3:46:56] <%SoFarFetched> they already read that book outside
[3:47:01] <+SWFanatic> This is just like my Japanese Anime
[3:47:06] <Sphincter_Spelunker> We already found out Pat was a villain in one of recent podcasts

[3:53:32] <+thebonebard> maybe try the other direction after jumping off the bridge
[3:53:33] <lordsdb> Did they check that letter in the corner?
[3:53:35] <%QueequegTheater> @wsintai yeah that's also good

[3:56:14] <+Punchasaur> emlo is pinata
[3:56:16] <Fear_Ranjer> Hug the wall maybe?
[3:56:17] <KaiserMario> The important thing is that you tried
[3:56:17] <Fujiwara_92> 3
[3:56:18] <Habblewater> Woolie Murder simulator
[3:56:20] <CherrieVelvet> @PeachSaliva did pat ever look behind the waterfall?
[3:56:21] <gazingeye1> go up hill near cave?
[3:56:23] <teflonbilly777> WAIT TILL TRUMPETS PLAY!
[3:56:23] <+crimsonharvest> maybe that 'nothing' by the cave was actually a path
[3:56:24] <Niney_Who> Dev pls give walkthrough
[3:56:25] <%QueequegTheater> @PeachSaliva call me Mirio because that was a Big 3
[3:56:25] <Valdorick> Wake him up
[3:56:27] <Dhurkst> Go up the left path past the cave?
[3:56:27] <+lethallunacyx> Well that's not surprising.
[3:56:28] <TwinBat> the left path next to the cave
[3:56:28] <+primax104> hall wuggin?
[3:56:29] <$Jack_of_No_Trades> is that path to the left of the fireplace cave a thing?
[3:56:29] <Youwereeatenbyalid> Double check everything down there?
[3:56:31] <+Jekado> so many bullets
[3:56:31] <bevyrage> jump down, follow path, then when you COULD go into the castle's bowels, take the left route instead
[3:56:32] <baronblank> there was path over by the passage that led to the fireplace, wasn't there?
[3:56:33] <$Dutchpotato> look up somebody else's playthrough 4Head
[3:56:34] <%g0atmeal> Play the whole game without killing anything
[3:56:35] <+Jekado> just like pat
[3:56:35] <lloyddboy> go up the ramp next to the cave?
[3:56:36] <Fox_landale> What if multiple endings was a work?
[3:56:40] <Hydrapissed> yah
[3:56:40] <Fujiwara_92> go to gamefacts Kappa
[3:56:41] <Hydrapissed> try that
[3:56:41] <+Jekado> i tried looking up other endings
[3:56:42] <Niney_Who> Wasn't really a ramp
[3:56:46] <$NitronStreams> Dev pls gib God mode
[3:56:47] <Niney_Who> Maybe there was more in the deep underground
[3:56:49] <+PalmtopNami> yes
[3:56:51] <MavMarsh> i just tried it and it's just a sheer cliff
[3:56:56] <%WheatlyXT> Yes
[3:56:56] <Zaphire_Saucypants> I mean...basic Gaming 101: Check behind the waterfall.
[3:57:01] <+Jekado> dig up the king grave again?
[3:57:02] <Mr__Jebus> someone suggested burying the baby in the empty grave awhile ago
[3:57:04] <%SoFarFetched> If the other multiple ends weren't in yet. They'd probably let pat and paige know .
[3:57:14] <%SoFarFetched> and say "sorry this ending doesnt work yet"
[3:57:21] <Hydrapissed> path of left maybe???

[4:03:50] <%nofestu2> Pat loves cube
[4:03:55] <absolute_cagemony> If touching yourself causes blood to shoot out of your body you're either very sick or a super hot vampire
[4:03:56] <+Jekado> maybe elmo is the best ending

[4:05:36] <Kazic5000> Woolie's jump noise makes me smile

[4:06:15] <+logoth_> this is the real wooliestorm
[4:06:15] <Louie_Salmon> I think that statue turns up when you're in the endgame, or something
[4:06:16] <theshillman> i dream of touching that bag
[4:06:17] <Habblewater> He's like a sponge
[4:06:24] <absolute_cagemony> Elmo's moisture has blessed you

[4:08:44] <$SiameseSneeze> Hey Paige, glad to have you back, much love
[4:08:48] <Hellarussian> how embarrassing
[4:08:51] <$SiameseSneeze> Later yall
[4:08:55] <Kazic5000> Is it the party cave?
[4:09:04] <KaiserMario> @PeachSaliva Try killing the other NPCs... maybe that'll do something...
[4:09:05] <TheChillRoom> I like how later power rangers series actually managed to deal with the wait time by making the transformation sequence an attack... barrier.. thing
[4:09:06] <+SWFanatic> Kill them all peter
[4:09:09] <+crimsonharvest> can you jump in the well and starve slowly
[4:09:09] <Jolly_Adventurer> Have they fallen down the waterfall?
[4:09:16] <%WheatlyXT> Waterfall!!
[4:09:17] <MartinHadAMeme01> Beter
[4:09:18] <%sleepy_coffee> Ohhh thats awesome
[4:09:23] <Jolly_Adventurer> Down the waterfall
[4:09:26] <MavMarsh> down the water specifically
[4:09:29] <%WheatlyXT> Check the waterfall!
[4:09:31] <+ledgefiendd> is this the wooliehole?
[4:09:33] <MavMarsh> at walking speed
[4:09:33] <%QueequegTheater> I think people are just taking guesses
[4:09:35] <Jolly_Adventurer> Yes
[4:09:36] <$Bane_Kaikyo> I really hope Paige still reads donations at some point, I mean I love hearing my shit read, it's validating
[4:09:39] <Jolly_Adventurer> There's a room
[4:09:39] <Youwereeatenbyalid> Hell no
[4:09:49] <heartlesshealer> she is still blanished
[4:09:51] <Fujiwara_92> no one knows nothing pat
[4:09:59] <jeffishype> Billy was actually gay and left the power rangers show due to abuse from other cast members, true facts
[4:10:02] <Youwereeatenbyalid> Blind guesses all over the place
[4:10:04] <+Punchasaur> rubberfist*** is my least favorite streamer
[4:10:04] <Maverick2736> either that, or chat's just trolling the F outta' you
[4:10:10] <$Agami23> @PeachSaliva come on, games always want you to check the waterfall.
[4:10:11] <+Hinasil> Chat is going to be so mad when the waterfall turns out to be nothing
[4:10:16] <DedlokPM> @PeachSaliva I saw someone mention on reddit about jumping in the river and letting the water flow carry you for some stuff
[4:10:18] <Decsevm> Peach do you have any plans to stream in the future?
[4:10:19] <Kazic5000> @Bane_Kaikyo I know. these guys read 3 things I typed tonight and my heart is POUNDING.
[4:10:19] <$Stevennapalm> feel like this might be a 3
[4:10:27] <InugamiTheHound> is it true the original red ranger left PR and did gay porn??
[4:10:27] <Youwereeatenbyalid> @jeffishype thats a lie and it has nothing to do with his cast members
[4:10:32] <TheChillRoom> Waterfall is 100% going to be a big pile of fuck all. Calling it now
[4:10:34] <Sphincter_Spelunker> chat's going so slow, no one will notice I'm blanished
[4:10:35] <0rond> what the fuck is a 3
[4:10:41] <MartinHadAMeme01> my mom blanished me from the house after i didn't do the dirty dishers :(
[4:10:42] <+StrawberryPantsu> Does this game have Zapping?
[4:10:42] <jeffishype> @Youwereeatenbyalid i mean he talked about it in an interview so
[4:10:44] <Desertfishing> went in a circle
[4:10:53] <+crimsonharvest> that was a loop :/
[4:11:00] <%nofestu2> apatBig Blanish
[4:11:06] <Zalthia> Woolie is so cute in this game
[4:11:08] <Dr_Mooose> too spooky
[4:11:09] <+StrawberryPantsu> If the Dev is here and they didnt add Zapping you failed
[4:11:09] <Fujiwara_92> big circle
[4:11:11] <SpicyCheeseNips> I don't like the drippy drop sounds
[4:11:13] <0rond> oh now it all makes sense, the monster vanished because of the ZAPPING SYSTEM
[4:11:13] <Decsevm> at least it isn't in space
[4:11:15] <pabloelenano2> @0rond means chat is being dumb
[4:11:15] <SpicyCheeseNips> they too spooky
[4:11:16] <Jolly_Adventurer> @0rond 1= Pat's wrong, 2= Paige's wrong, 3= chat's wrong
[4:11:27] <%QueequegTheater> @StrawberryPantsu they kind of did, after getting ending B the monster disappeared
[4:11:40] <+StrawberryPantsu> Nice
[4:11:40] <Zaphire_Saucypants> twas but a butt
[4:11:42] <$Stevennapalm> 2
[4:11:42] <MartinHadAMeme01> she thinks it has a butthead haha
[4:11:44] <billyup00> butt butt in the wut
[4:11:44] <SpicyCheeseNips> Paige your eyes are dumb, go to a doctor.
[4:11:47] <KaiserMario> @PeachSaliva You never talked to Pat after digging up the grave, the only thing he says to you is about the lighthouse, which ponts to the grave
[4:11:50] <%depressed_skeleton> Box-spider isn't real, Paige
[4:11:58] <Fujiwara_92> GO TO THE EYE DOCTOR
[4:12:01] <$SiameseSneeze> BIG CRAZY
[4:12:05] <TheChillRoom> Box spider can't hurt you Paige
[4:12:10] <MartinHadAMeme01> box-spider hurt me :(
[4:12:11] <Kemmybelle> Does the red light monster show up anymore after getting ending B?
[4:12:14] <0rond> we are all confused on this blursed day
[4:12:22] <+Jekado> for some reason i was thinking boxing spider
[4:12:23] <%g0atmeal> Unlike Box Rat, which is quite real
[4:12:26] <Decsevm> when is peach going to get her new glasses
[4:12:27] <TheChillRoom> @MartinHadAMeme01 B ox spider can hurt you. It just can't hurt Paige. She's too big and strong
[4:12:28] <+Jekado> which would be op
[4:12:35] <Youwereeatenbyalid> He doesnt die
[4:12:38] <misterspotswood> he doesnt, he reloads the save
[4:12:39] <%sleepy_coffee> I see pat butt n I get confused
[4:12:39] <+Matto424> it's the mind chemicals
[4:12:41] <$Agami23> immortal but not unkillable
[4:12:41] <+lucaflow> Because he didn't know what he was messing with
[4:12:42] <+SWFanatic> Woolie ceases to be
[4:12:42] <%GabeSweetMan> Did we ever get that actual jump scare?
[4:12:42] <MartinHadAMeme01> imagine if a bunch of spider's came out of your gf's box, haha that would be so weird and gross right????
[4:12:49] <Youwereeatenbyalid> He just doesnt know what what hes messing with
[4:12:50] <$Jack_of_No_Trades> Ive never seen him die, he just lays down.
[4:12:53] <$Stevennapalm> woolie is absolved from his sins so he can die
[4:12:57] <jeffishype> @Youwereeatenbyalid its actually literally on his wiki page
[4:13:01] <$Stevennapalm> and leave burgatory
[4:13:03] <+Jekado> "i'm pregnant, with spiders"
[4:13:04] <hntronium> what do you mean paige woolie is alive he's right there
[4:13:06] <Trash_leviathan> i think ending A is killing the monster but maybe the game is glitched
[4:13:06] <Haarute> wasn't there another bridge in the forest somewhere?
[4:13:07] <%SoFarFetched> he technically went into the lake,itwas where that snakewas
[4:13:08] <+Jekado> "NOT AGAIN"
[4:13:10] <TheChillRoom> @MartinHadAMeme01 That's a whole other kind of box spiders doing a series of hurting to me.
[4:13:13] <jeffishype> David Yost got a hard shake
[4:13:13] <+Punchasaur> he's not dead, you're still playing as him right 4Head
[4:13:23] <Kazic5000> Are you changing the camera manually?
[4:13:24] <lloyddboy> snake in the lake
[4:13:27] <%sleepy_coffee> Depleted chemicals
[4:13:32] <MartinHadAMeme01> box-spider's are also known as crabs
[4:13:33] <+SWFanatic> rake in the lake
[4:13:33] <+McSnazzyPants> burgertory would be a great name for a band and/or restaurant
[4:13:40] <TheChillRoom> Woolie confirmed to have the same Stand as the president of the united states.
[4:13:41] <$Stevennapalm> it is a restaurant
[4:13:45] <$Stevennapalm> in pittsburgh
[4:13:46] <Youwereeatenbyalid> @jeffishype it wasnt the cast members, it was the director+ general film crew
[4:13:50] <SpicyCheeseNips> Those statues are very suspect
[4:14:00] <jeffishype> @Youwereeatenbyalid yeah you are actually correct, i misread
[4:14:01] <+Jekado> @McSnazzyPants the burgers there sounds like they would be bland
[4:14:02] <Habblewater> Did the Castle Super Beast theme song Paige did go anywhere? Because that shit was a banger
[4:14:06] <%QueequegTheater> Weeping Angels
[4:14:10] <baronblank> is the map more smudged now than it was before?
[4:14:13] <Ultra_Pancake> Is Burgertory only in Pittsburgh? I figured it was a chain?
[4:14:20] <Hydrapissed> what a cam whore
[4:14:25] <%QueequegTheater> I'm still so mad that the show showed the angels moving that one time
[4:14:28] <Kazic5000> mew :3
[4:14:28] <Broand> but what does BK stand for
[4:14:29] <SquiglyBattleOpera> apatPorgmo
[4:14:30] <Dhurkst> SCREM
[4:14:30] <+McSnazzyPants> yeah but you could have burgers named the inferno burger or the paradiso burger
[4:14:31] <+Punchasaur> weeping Chris Angels
[4:14:39] <$Stevennapalm> @Ultra_Pancake I've only seen the one there, probably is a chain
[4:14:39] <Dr_Mooose> "don't touch me"
[4:14:40] <+SWFanatic> apatWink
[4:14:43] <+Jekado> BK stands for Bonky KONG
[4:14:45] <0rond> burger king, it's the gun that kills the wcdonalds
[4:14:48] <Youwereeatenbyalid> @jeffishype that ones come up a lot. Try to correct it where i can. Witch hunts are no good.
[4:14:49] <Trash_leviathan> i prefer scp 173 over hte weeping angels
[4:14:50] <hntronium> Bastle KuperSeast
[4:14:51] <Zalthia> I’m still so mad that the STATUE OF LIBERTY was an angel
[4:14:58] <Habblewater> Burger Kong
[4:15:00] <Zalthia> That is such bs
[4:15:01] <NeroInfinite> He doesn't know he can't do damage because of his short claws.
[4:15:02] <MartinHadAMeme01> BK stands for Big Krumbers
[4:15:08] <Kazic5000> @Trash_leviathan Peanut is love, peanut is life.
[4:15:09] <+Punchasaur> BRANK KASTLW
[4:15:09] <Trash_leviathan> @Zalthia wtf
[4:15:10] <hntronium> Big Kombo
[4:15:13] <%sleepy_coffee> He stare into the soul sipsipHellmo
[4:15:14] <+Randomxdfun> Is this Woolie simulator?
[4:15:18] <Valdorick> Big Khungus
[4:15:27] <MartinHadAMeme01> Black Koward
[4:15:28] <baronblank> did the jumpscare ever happen?
[4:15:30] <SpicyCheeseNips> @Zalthia Is that real? That's super dumb
[4:15:30] <VestigeOuroboros> Woolie simulator is a different game, that's the one where he kills that guy.
[4:15:31] <NeroInfinite> "I must clean myself of thishuman grease"
[4:15:36] <FiachraDonovan> There was a burger place here called Burgatory but the name changed to Burger story for some reason
[4:15:37] <TheChillRoom> @Zalthia To be fair, it was only an Angel because it was close enough in appearance to the statues that they were able to use it to reproduce
[4:15:37] <hntronium> no you were running from redman
[4:15:41] <jeffishype> @Youwereeatenbyalid yeah, good call on it, i got confused for a second thanks for the call out on it
[4:15:41] <heartlesshealer> Burnt house was kinda found during the red haze
[4:15:44] <Trash_leviathan> the burnt house never existed
[4:15:45] <InugamiTheHound> what if getting the other enings are gltiched because you got the b ending?
[4:15:46] <+Randomxdfun> needs more pie and holes
[4:15:46] <Habblewater> ooooo
[4:15:50] <0rond> this is a normal day for woolie
[4:15:54] <Dhurkst> Woolie's Grenada Adventures
[4:15:54] <tigerfang86> it just happens
[4:15:56] <tigerfang86> naturally
[4:15:57] <Trash_leviathan> it was a figmant of your imagination
[4:15:59] <+Prevot> so how lung until big give up
[4:16:04] <+Punchasaur> Big Korrect
[4:16:05] <Zalthia> People are literally always looking at it! It makes no sense!
[4:16:08] <mr_slaide> Save us, ELMO!
[4:16:08] <Kazic5000> This is how Woolie got so swole. Running from spoders.
[4:16:09] <SpicyCheeseNips> NEW SHIT NEW SHIT
[4:16:14] <tigerfang86> WE DO IT
[4:16:18] <Ultra_Pancake> Huh, I didn't realize Burgatory was a local chain. Btw your burgers come with little plastic pitchforks stabbed through them.
[4:16:19] <Habblewater> Barf Karbine
[4:16:20] <tigerfang86> WHOA
[4:16:22] <tigerfang86> WHOAAAAA
[4:16:24] <BeefyQueefer> Paige didn't choose the lost lifestyle, the lost lifestyle chose her.
[4:16:29] <+TheNommad> ooh elmo likes the gaem
[4:16:31] <Sphincter_Spelunker> The king found centipedes in the house
[4:16:33] <heartlesshealer> That's how you find out about the knife!
[4:16:34] <VestigeOuroboros> Please be a purple clear gbc
[4:16:35] <Niney_Who> you got that stuff though
[4:16:35] <%sleepy_coffee> It is the meme generator simulator
[4:16:36] <MartinHadAMeme01> the king sucks
[4:16:37] <hntronium> check the lake I guess
[4:16:39] <Zaphire_Saucypants> and that's for the key
[4:16:41] <wulfsbane_jolt> you read this
[4:16:41] <DedlokPM> WATERFALL CONFIRMED rooPog

[4:17:11] <wulfsbane_jolt> absolutely read that
[4:17:12] <TheChillRoom> @Zalthia Yeah, that part is bizarre. The only way it makes sense is if the angels have access to perception filter technology, which would be unprecedented. Well crap. My suspension of disbelief just shat the bed
[4:17:13] <MavMarsh> what a nice spider
[4:17:14] <%QueequegTheater> damn

[4:18:36] <KaiserMario> @PeachSaliva GO SAVE
[4:18:36] <Zalthia> @thechillroom not to mention all the souvenirs that are of the Statue of Liberty, and post cards, and heck even desktop backgrounds. Are they all angels too??? If they were that widespread wouldn’t more people know about it???????

[4:18:47] <+FrostMass22> Paige spends her mornings in self-bondage
[4:18:51] <+TheNommad> The rumor come out, does Paige is Vampire?
[4:18:54] <%depressed_skeleton> @QueequegTheater I'mma look
[4:18:56] <+crimsonharvest> Paige makes herself as vulnerable as possible to trick the ghosts
[4:18:57] <Niney_Who> Never a man because it was a Demon
[4:18:59] <$NitronStreams> ENDING [S]HITS FUCKED
[4:18:59] <Niney_Who> Maybe

[4:24:19] <MavMarsh> prepare to cry because of chemicals
[4:24:23] <qaaj> @TheChillRoom I actually don't know the context of your discussion. Just answering what I remember of the Weeping Angels. There's this whole other thing of them propagating through image and videos and other statues...but let's ignore that.
[4:24:23] <Coystick> Castle Super Beast 2!!!!
[4:24:24] <BeefyQueefer> pwats widdle fwinger in de pwie
[4:24:25] <+isitaspider> Paige DLC let's go
[4:24:29] <$Jack_of_No_Trades> Paige should voice pat
[4:24:29] <Aquaczaz> dangit D: I'll have to catch the vod
[4:24:41] <+lucaflow> dang no clip of the jump scare either
[4:24:42] <%g0atmeal> They'll both audition for the role of pat
[4:24:43] <%goose_attack_almanac> what if thats not the jumpscare
[4:24:45] <Aquaczaz> outer worlds makin' me miss a bunch
[4:24:45] <+Capta1n_H3nry> Can't for y'all to talk about this on the podcast
[4:24:46] <VestigeOuroboros> Paige is a voice in the woods when you walk that just screams WHOOOO SAIDDDD THATTTTT
[4:24:50] <Zaphire_Saucypants> what does dust in the machine MEAN tho...
[4:24:52] <%ThePabe> omfg you're still live
[4:24:52] <%sleepy_coffee> Make the bag become the shook
[4:24:57] <+Jekado> paige please do your super eyepatch wolf impression
[4:25:05] <Youwereeatenbyalid> Industry connections man
[4:25:06] <Broand> the heck does dust in the machine mean
[4:25:06] <Zaphire_Saucypants> also, that body looked a LOT like a root in places
[4:25:09] <Youwereeatenbyalid> Cant fight them
[4:25:10] <$Dutchpotato> Pat didn't sound dead inside enough to be Pat
[4:25:11] <%nofestu2> It's like their siblings
[4:25:12] <%depressed_skeleton> oh no, pats hot
[4:25:12] <+yuppie_water> I really like the alone in the dark graphics
[4:25:16] <+El8oney> This game is outrageously good
[4:25:22] <%ThePabe> ThePabe subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 9 months! 
[4:25:22] <TheChillRoom> @qaaj Oh yes! That's where things get really weird with that episode because OH BOY EVERY SOUVENIR STATUE IS AN ANGEL NOW is a scenario that should have gone down but didn't?
[4:25:23] <Personified134> ok but what ACTUALLY does that mean
[4:25:27] <ZComiX> Well they'll need a PAT voice and a KING voice. SO when its reveal to be the same person you can do that creepy 2 voice thing.
[4:25:28] <@MelBrooksKA> Get a really strong Pat feel from Paige
[4:25:29] <+Prevot> we heard Pat reading his lines earlier and he has a terrible Pat voice
[4:25:29] <Youwereeatenbyalid> No pat?
[4:25:33] <+Punchasaur> Pat is not tall enough to play himself
[4:25:33] <%depressed_skeleton> the art style is giving me 90's claymation flashbacks, i love it.
[4:25:35] <MavMarsh> runs really well for a 3d unity indie game too
[4:25:41] <MavMarsh> my laptop usually just dies trying
[4:25:43] <qaaj> @TheChillRoom Statue of Liberty Angel btw
[4:25:47] <Sternold123> We're the rats
[4:25:55] <Niney_Who> Maybe go to that cave again?
[4:25:56] <+Jekado> jump off the side now!
[4:25:57] <+McSnazzyPants> can you shoot pat
[4:25:57] <+NWR_James> YUP YUP YUP
[4:26:00] <$Stevennapalm> show him stuff?
[4:26:03] <Dhurkst> emlo leg stretch
[4:26:04] <baronblank> talk to the other npcs now maybe?
[4:26:05] <Youwereeatenbyalid> Check the grave?
[4:26:06] <+Jekado> he did shoot him
[4:26:07] <baronblank> no idea
[4:26:11] <Zalthia> Unity gets a bad rap, but it’s actually pretty awesome
[4:26:12] <Fujiwara_92> what dust in the machine means?
[4:26:18] <+SWFanatic> Kill Pat with gun
[4:26:19] <+crimsonharvest> If i was coaching pat I'd tell him "say it like paige just did some paige type shit"
[4:26:19] <%g0atmeal> Litter in front of him?
[4:26:21] <+McSnazzyPants> it means you should clean out your pc
[4:26:22] <Niney_Who> Maybe the grave, maybe the Cave again
[4:26:22] <PurePlatinumKyo> Is what Woolie said different now? He said "I don't think it matters at this point." this time. I don't remember if he said that before
[4:26:28] <heartlesshealer> I'd say either grave, bridge, or skeleton closet
[4:26:31] <+Jekado> factory?
[4:26:32] <Trash_leviathan> maybe go back to the cave with the monster
[4:26:33] <0rond> now go to the monster's lair
[4:26:37] <Fox_landale> Shoot pat, like a dozen times.
[4:26:38] <+Jekado> invisible factory?
[4:26:40] <%QueequegTheater> The Weeping Angels are like the Borg because they became shittier every time they showed up again
[4:26:41] <+HotBloodedHero> Is Dust in the Machine Ending [D]?
[4:26:42] <Sternold123> Why is Pat playing on a Peach stream
[4:26:44] <Habblewater> Means you need some Compressed Air
[4:26:49] <Fox_landale> In the game too.
[4:26:50] <Youwereeatenbyalid> Oh interesting
[4:26:52] <qaaj> This is such a surreal stream
[4:26:55] <heartlesshealer> good catch
[4:26:56] <+Punchasaur> it means you need to dig your Dreamcast out of your closet
[4:26:56] <Sternold123> was Peach unable to solve the puzzle
[4:26:57] <Zaphire_Saucypants> maybe shoot Pat a lot?
[4:27:03] <ShadeTheNovice> LUL
[4:27:05] <Jolly_Adventurer> LUL
[4:27:06] <Kazic5000> LUL
[4:27:09] <+idyota> LUL
[4:27:10] <Malisin_Murder> LUL
[4:27:11] <Fujiwara_92> LUL
[4:27:11] <+miguelrod777> LUL
[4:27:12] <+Jekado> she can't tank controls
[4:27:12] <%SoFarFetched> TANK CONTROLS
[4:27:13] <%GabeSweetMan> THE SUN WENT DOWN
[4:27:14] <Zalthia> Is the monster a machine?
[4:27:15] <mr_slaide> It's the Lupus.
[4:27:15] <tigerfang86> LUL
[4:27:16] <wsintai> @Sternold123 It uses tank controls
[4:27:17] <VestigeOuroboros> Pat playing woolie on a peach stream talking about himself in third person
[4:27:17] <%nofestu2> he hates it
[4:27:18] <Youwereeatenbyalid> its a concept
[4:27:18] <$Stevennapalm> paige's eyesight is at risk
[4:27:19] <+Jekado> then shoot him in the game
[4:27:19] <+Archphronimos> Could be some cryptic metaphorical line.
[4:27:20] <+ColonelSioux> @Sternold123 she was being paige lo
[4:27:20] <+FrostMass22> Paige has brain problems
[4:27:20] <Ion_Laser> LUL
[4:27:21] <+miguelrod777> tank controls
[4:27:21] <billyup00> super tank controls next time?
[4:27:22] <KaiserMario> The true ending shows Pat is a brain in a jar and this is his mind castle
[4:27:26] <TheChillRoom> @qaaj Yeah, exactly. If I remember the rules right for images of an angel being angels, as soon as you made the statue of liberty into a weeping angel perceived by the Doctor, every image of the statue of liberty, every mug, every tiny commemorative statue... you see where this is going
[4:27:26] <heartlesshealer> What matters is that Paige is here to be on her stream
[4:27:35] <BeefyQueefer> Paige you accidentally quit the game
[4:27:37] <+bread_assassin> Pat better get to see two boobs after this.
[4:27:41] <wsintai> @PeachSaliva Paige you were just running into walls for 20 minutes before Pat took over
[4:27:44] <Sphincter_Spelunker> She elongates her vowels everytime she
[4:27:46] <%sleepy_coffee> Wooooodah
[4:27:47] <%depressed_skeleton> Please don't open my closet.
[4:27:50] <+Punchasaur> this game isn't hard enough for Paige to be good at it
[4:27:50] <Jolly_Adventurer> So is the monster not in the cave anymore?
[4:27:51] <Sphincter_Spelunker> everytime she's wrong*
[4:27:52] <Louie_Salmon> Well, gotta be the grave I guess
[4:27:53] <%depressed_skeleton> i have a person in there.
[4:27:55] <heartlesshealer> ????
[4:28:00] <+isitaspider> Is this the updated version of the game?
[4:28:00] <Niney_Who> try Emily again
[4:28:03] <+TheWinged7> ex-scape :P
[4:28:05] <+El8oney> return of Xscape
[4:28:08] <heartlesshealer> Were there still enemies in the throne room?
[4:28:10] <%depressed_skeleton> es cap ee
[4:28:11] <baronblank> I'm interested mostly in where to use the dagger
[4:28:12] <+NWR_James> Goodnight chat, goodnight elmo, goodnight...I dont think I missed anyone
[4:28:13] <Ion_Laser> @isitaspider yes
[4:28:15] <+ColonelSioux> @isitaspider yea
[4:28:16] <Zaphire_Saucypants> only thing that even comes close to being a machine I can think of is the Lighthouse.
[4:28:19] <@MelBrooksKA> [X]cap ending
[4:28:22] <+portlandsunshine> SHOOT PAT. Pat hates being shot.
[4:28:23] <%sleepy_coffee> Em-lo
[4:28:27] <+ColonelSioux> @NWR_James night nwr
[4:28:27] <%Divryne> JK ROWLING IS THAT YOU?
[4:28:30] <silverira> @PeachSaliva hey can you kill the npcs?
[4:28:31] <lloyddboy> books on the shelf?
[4:28:34] <heartlesshealer> Goodnight James
[4:28:39] <$Stevennapalm> paige better touch both of pat's dicks in thanks
[4:28:41] <%ThePuddingDead> @PeachSaliva This has been a perfect back drop to me revisiting Elite Dangerous, thanks for your work and glad you're doing better
[4:28:43] <Zalthia> :(
[4:28:43] <hntronium> If you jump on the table can you read the book in the middle
[4:28:44] <+crimsonharvest> is that yellow thing a keyhole? did i miss the first part of this?
[4:28:49] <+SWFanatic> Ending [S]hoot Pat until he dies from GUN

[4:29:07] <Youwereeatenbyalid> Yeah, I'm in favor of unloading into pat
[4:29:10] <0rond> go to the monster's layer?
[4:29:12] <Dr_Mooose> this my jam
[4:29:13] <TheChillRoom> Even when it comes to turning the lights on, shit's locked.
[4:29:15] <Sphincter_Spelunker> "She's just mashing it"
[4:29:16] <0rond> lair*

[4:29:34] <MasterDecoder> Pat, can 'you' play Moonlight Sonata?
[4:29:37] <Niney_Who> Nah
[4:29:38] <$Agami23> @PeachSaliva coulden't you play the piano, or am i crazy?
[4:29:38] <+Jekado> TRY HEATING THE KEY?
[4:29:51] <Niney_Who> I assume Dev knows the rule of "why do something a bunch with 0 feedback"
[4:29:52] <%QueequegTheater> what
[4:29:52] <TheChillRoom> Try cooling the key.
[4:29:54] <Zaphire_Saucypants> And THEN cooling it!
[4:29:57] <tigerfang86> what if we just shot pat a bunch
[4:29:58] <Enyoyable> Remember: Pat HATES getting shot.
[4:29:58] <@MelBrooksKA> Pat hates getting shot
[4:30:00] <tigerfang86> .......irl

[4:30:15] <hntronium> he got the dagger from the top left area
[4:30:16] <Kazic5000> HONK
[4:30:18] <Rostichenburg> Well Pat does hate bullets
[4:30:18] <baronblank> it is where you got the dagger
[4:30:22] <+Punchasaur> in your butt
[4:30:24] <billyup00> shoot em!
[4:30:24] <Broand> try using the key on the piano
[4:30:25] <wulfsbane_jolt> THE LID

[4:30:31] <gazingeye1> YOU GOT KEY FROM THE SEA!
[4:30:31] <neck_bear> what if you stab Pat with the dagger
[4:30:32] <+crimsonharvest> wrap the key between your balls
[4:30:33] <%TheMattman1313> @PeachSaliva Dagger was from the lake. Lights key was on the table.
[4:30:34] <+Jekado> HEHEHEHE ANYONE REMEMBER MSG Aparently Konami doesn't
[4:30:38] <lloyddboy> nuhh
[4:30:39] <+AntithesisEK> deeply existential

[4:30:44] <VestigeOuroboros> Have you tried touching the perfectly calibrated video settings
[4:30:44] <hntronium> nothing
[4:30:45] <$NitronStreams> This kills the Pat
[4:30:45] <KaiserMario> Nah...
[4:30:46] <%GabeSweetMan> no no aim for the colostomy bag
[4:30:49] <qaaj> I'm so jealous of Paige being able to intimately describe Pat's dick for accurate depiction in my Castle Superbeast slash fiction.
[4:30:49] <Graxe_> Hates getting shot
[4:30:50] <0rond> look at him, he HATES getting shot!
[4:30:50] <Youwereeatenbyalid> Yeah, that's nothing
[4:30:50] <RupanSen> i m m o r t a l
[4:30:50] <+McSnazzyPants> he hates it
[4:30:52] <Graxe_> But can't die
[4:30:52] <Zaphire_Saucypants> HE'S IMMORTAL!
[4:30:53] <hntronium> IMMORTAL PAT
[4:30:56] <$Dutchpotato> almost as if he's immortal....
[4:30:58] <+Punchasaur> PAT HATES GETTING SHOT
[4:30:58] <Hydrapissed> pat is shooting himself
[4:30:59] <+AntithesisEK> aim for the gout
[4:30:59] <SpicyCheeseNips> HE IS IMMORTAL HOLY SHIT
[4:31:00] <%sleepy_coffee> Eat dah key
[4:31:01] <BeefyQueefer> he doesn't die, he's like some kind of immortal
[4:31:02] <$Jack_of_No_Trades> I always thought this was how it would end
[4:31:03] <Trash_leviathan> what could the dagger be for
[4:31:03] <PurePlatinumKyo> Perhaps there's something new in the lake now that you got teleported there from the waterfall cave?
[4:31:06] <Dr_Mooose> lets try another 20 bullets, just to be sure
[4:31:06] <Niney_Who> I say check grave
[4:31:08] <+Jekado> note if i meet pat in real life... immune to bullets
[4:31:09] <Admiral_PopnFresh> apatPat cryGun
[4:31:10] <Dhurkst> @Jekado Konami doesn't remember monosodium glutamate
[4:31:12] <DracaenaLeaf> When you're so lost and you decide to kill your friend or yourself
[4:31:12] <Youwereeatenbyalid> So the plot HAS progressed
[4:31:16] <Monkeyweed21> What did Remirae say?
[4:31:18] <Niney_Who> If not grave, Check that Waterfall cave again
[4:31:19] <lloyddboy> shoot the others?
[4:31:20] <%SoFarFetched> Maybe there's more items in the lake?
[4:31:20] <+HotBloodedHero> Can you shoot any other npc?
[4:31:21] <Rostichenburg> King's Key was also in the lake
[4:31:22] <NeroInfinite> Woolie is the onlyonenot immortal
[4:31:24] <Hydrapissed> pat is immortal woolie has a soul stone
[4:31:26] <Hydrapissed> watch
[4:31:27] <a_mad_dragon> kill every NPC you can
[4:31:33] <Yadogari> What about the foreground of the waterfall area?
[4:31:35] <0rond> what happens if you go back to the the waterfall cave?
[4:31:35] <+Archphronimos> Too angry to live, too stubborn to die
[4:31:37] <wulfsbane_jolt> can you turn off the lighthouse?
[4:31:39] <Fujiwara_92> not everything is Undertale paige
[4:31:40] <+Punchasaur> and you didn't even have to become toilet
[4:31:41] <Youwereeatenbyalid> Pat is in fact third-strike parrying the bullets
[4:31:45] <neck_bear> Stab Pat with the dagger
[4:31:47] <heartlesshealer> Was King's Key ever used?
[4:31:47] <theshillman> @PeachSaliva It's 8am in sweden
[4:31:47] <+Jekado> swedish? try eating meatballs?
[4:31:51] <misterspotswood> nucking futs
[4:31:52] <hntronium> what machines do we know of in this game?
[4:31:54] <Kirby_Sauce> Ain't nothing worse than pat on pat violence
[4:32:06] <+Jekado> Pat he's a sex machine
[4:32:07] <+Punchasaur> gun
[4:32:07] <0rond> lighthouse = machine?
[4:32:07] <%QueequegTheater> the spear boys
[4:32:11] <Niney_Who> The gun, the workshop, and the lighthouse I guess
[4:32:11] <qaaj> Patricide stream
[4:32:15] <Youwereeatenbyalid> A machine for pigs?
[4:32:16] <TheChillRoom> Wrestling is Undertale now. Everything is at the very least on its way to being Undertale
[4:32:20] <Zaphire_Saucypants> maybe try going against the flow of the water beneath the waterfall?
[4:32:23] <+SWFanatic> "Love is a machine." - Woolie
[4:32:25] <+HotBloodedHero> Clean the dust from the lighthouse
[4:32:31] <0rond> wait what if the lighthouse doesn't rotate BECAUSE OF THE DUST
[4:32:34] <thehashslingingslashers> Maybe its just a reference to a joke
[4:32:39] <Youwereeatenbyalid> @peachsaliva have we rechecked the grave to see if the statue showed up?
[4:32:40] <%g0atmeal> Yeah waterfall but other direction

[4:33:02] <+Archphronimos> Is Remerei an Elder Scrolls lore fan? "The Machine" could be meta and referring to the computer you're using in the real world.

[4:36:13] <Zaphire_Saucypants> hrm...I wonder what items go into the empty slots...
[4:36:14] <NeroInfinite> I doubt they'd make a fuck up like that
[4:36:16] <Valdorick> Death STranding will be a 50 Kappa
[4:36:21] <TheChillRoom> @PeachSaliva It's good to see you live again, penis regardless
[4:36:21] <DavidSanChan> death stranding is the sequel to imagine babyz
[4:36:22] <+Punchasaur> ign has an IQ of 6.3
[4:36:30] <%ninjanope_> ninjanope_ subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 8 months! 
[4:36:30] <+XeroSigmaPrime> HOLY SHIT IGN HATES DEATH STRANDING
[4:36:30] <Youwereeatenbyalid> Maybe you should HEAT the key
[4:36:35] <$Cobalt_Racer> ah, the king key was what I thought was fire
[4:36:38] <Zalthia> Honestly I’d wait for the hype to die down before checking the review scores
[4:36:40] <MartinHadAMeme01> @Punchasaur ign isn't a single person
[4:36:47] <+Jekado> glitched
[4:36:51] <+HotBloodedHero> What if the beast is considered an item, and she fell into the see, went down the river and ended up down the waterfall.
[4:36:51] <%g0atmeal> yo
[4:36:51] <TheChillRoom> IGN also rates literally anything even slightly esoteric poorly. They have a track record there.

[4:37:45] <+Punchasaur> Splooigi
[4:37:48] <Kirby_Sauce> Getting slimed by gooigi
[4:37:49] <Sphincter_Spelunker> Goouigi can be whatever you want

[4:38:15] <+JaceADisgrace> but he can still give you one
[4:38:19] <hntronium> the scary red person was the one hanging wasn't it?
[4:38:22] <tigerfang86> Gooigi has no bones which is a powerful buff
[4:38:23] <%QueequegTheater> I bet Birkin killed it
[4:38:25] <MartinHadAMeme01> haha imagine gooigi all over your body and he kisses you while sliming you wow

[4:38:50] <%SoFarFetched> with monster slime girls
[4:38:50] <VestigeOuroboros> Destroyed
[4:38:50] <Dhurkst> I'm surprised that people still take IGN seriously enough as a source of reviews to spread news of their bad reviews.
[4:38:51] <Personified134> wow
[4:38:52] <%GabeSweetMan> Yeah this FAR above my expectations.
[4:38:55] <%wulfsbane_jolt> ow
[4:38:55] <Laironx3> CurseLit
[4:38:56] <+Punchasaur> the first thing I ever made in after effects was called Louija
[4:38:57] <Fujiwara_92> poor pat
[4:38:59] <Ion_Laser> Big Burn
[4:38:59] <Admiral_PopnFresh> this is scary?
[4:39:01] <Valdorick> aw man
[4:39:01] <Zaphire_Saucypants> It's BEYOND the lvl of Pat.
[4:39:02] <NeroInfinite> It's a classy kinda jank
[4:39:02] <$NitronStreams> game is not trash
[4:39:07] <PurePlatinumKyo> Some of the shadows things in the forest cast with the lantern on keep tripping me up and thinking there's stuff moving out there
[4:39:08] <+dayz1003> @bear_breaker20 no the t-1000 was the liquid metal one played by robert Patrick
[4:39:08] <misterspotswood> i thought it be a 20 minute joke fest
[4:39:10] <KaiserMario> YongYea Death Stranding review: "It's a fascinating slow burn ~50 hours experience through which the theme of connections shines before going out with a bang. I can't guarantee it'll be for everyone, but I was really compelled by it."
[4:39:10] <hntronium> ign is a fuck
[4:39:11] <Kazic5000> 4Head 🍷
[4:39:13] <Sphincter_Spelunker> bruh
[4:39:18] <+Archphronimos> Well done compliment/sick burn
[4:39:20] <feoral> did you all ever go the other way in the monster cave?
[4:39:26] <$Jack_of_No_Trades> That was the meanest way you could say something so nice
[4:39:26] <Trash_leviathan> remember imagine party babies is a better game than god hand according to ign
[4:39:27] <Kazic5000> Scary but charming.
[4:39:29] <+Blargimazombie> IGN gave this game a 6.3/10 as well
[4:39:34] <+Jekado> is this game, game of the year for 2019?
[4:39:38] <bear_breaker20> @dayz1003 i just wanted to picture buff luigi mmmmk?
[4:39:38] <Decsevm> i would say it is unsettling more than just scary
[4:39:44] <+XeroSigmaPrime> Death Stranding is apparently polarizing as fuck
[4:39:45] <%SoFarFetched> They did,it was just a loop in the monster cave. So they just went up the ladder.
[4:39:46] <Kwazhar> ign japan gave it a 9.5
[4:39:46] <MartinHadAMeme01> a 50 hour kojima experience is a bad idea, MGSV proved that
[4:39:57] <Zaphire_Saucypants> dig behind the grave?
[4:39:58] <neck_bear> is something on the back of the grave?
[4:39:59] <+primax104> atmospheric
[4:40:03] <%wulfsbane_jolt> @kirby_sauce forgot if I said thank you, so thank you
[4:40:06] <misterspotswood> merc those fools so you can expore fully
[4:40:07] <+dayz1003> @bear_breaker20 well ya can't missjyNo

[4:40:09] <+XeroSigmaPrime> @MartinHadAMeme01 Laughs in MGS4
[4:40:11] <hntronium> murderer is on the back of the gravestone
[4:40:11] <Zalthia> I’d wait for the hype to die down first
[4:40:13] <Niney_Who> Uhh... workshop?
[4:40:15] <bevyrage> @neck_bear scratched words that reads 'MURDERER'
[4:40:16] <%TheMattman1313> @PeachSaliva Kill everything in the forest?
[4:40:16] <Dhurkst> @XeroSigmaPrime Not surprised
[4:40:29] <neck_bear> I thought that was the side
[4:40:29] <$Jack_of_No_Trades> Killl everything? Like all of iti?
[4:40:30] <+yeknomlive> we talkin bout deathstranding reviews
[4:40:30] <$cirocomic> Knife in grave?
[4:40:32] <Zalthia> Is that monster a machine?
[4:40:32] <Niney_Who> Nah
[4:40:34] <Kazic5000> Who cares what IGN says? They gave Mass Effect 3 9.5.
[4:40:35] <Zaphire_Saucypants> wasn't there a statue by the cliff that was special?
[4:40:35] <Youwereeatenbyalid> Anyone in here gotten beyond ending B?
[4:40:36] <bear_breaker20> @dayz1003 xxxNK xxxED cant stop that which has already been done
[4:40:36] <BeefyQueefer> what about that area with the three tree stumps?
[4:40:38] <TheChillRoom> Death Stranding seems like solid proof that Kojima walked so people like Suda51 and Swery could run
[4:40:41] <bevyrage> the metal men are goo in armor
[4:40:42] <+Punchasaur> @martinhadameme01 do you actually blame mgsv's flaws in kojima and not konami
[4:40:44] <Niney_Who> What?

[4:42:08] <Zalthia> You could pick this up after the dev gets back to you
[4:42:09] <KaiserMario> Retire for today, get a walkthrough and finidh tomorrow?
[4:42:17] <Fujiwara_92> maybe getting B first fucked up the way to get A? @peachsaliva

[4:42:31] <Habblewater> DONT MAKE ME TURN THIS COUCH AROUND YOUNG MAN
[4:42:32] <hntronium> Who where has gotten ending A?
[4:42:38] <+Lost_Zombie> Death Stranding reviews are out
[4:42:39] <%GabeSweetMan> Whatever it is you need to do, it sounds like it's going to be either very obscure OR the glitch actually made other endings impossible.
[4:42:42] <Kazic5000> Suplex Emlo
[4:42:45] <MavMarsh> i've tried it if you miss the waterfall cave you just die
[4:42:49] <Niney_Who> I assume A is just killing the monster maybe
[4:42:49] <pabloelenano2> @PeachSaliva after the dust in the machine part when you go to the cave under the bridge in the castle and going to the king room i noticed the living armors didnt agro at this time, when they used to be basically in the door
[4:42:51] <misterspotswood> i dont play videogames :(
[4:42:59] <hntronium> I know someone here earlier said he got two endings
[4:43:13] <VestigeOuroboros> Have you tried shooting the toilet that represents pat's immortal body and soul
[4:43:17] <%SoFarFetched> Or maybe it's time for a part 2.
[4:43:27] <Youwereeatenbyalid> ...i mean i guess
[4:43:27] <%GabeSweetMan> Have we already re-explored the dungeon?
[4:43:31] <Louie_Salmon> @pabloelenano2 I think it was just taking them a second, I never had anything special happen with them
[4:43:32] <Zalthia> @peachsaliva you could always come back to the game after the dev gets back to you
[4:43:32] <NeroInfinite> Find the toilet and shoot it
[4:43:34] <+XeroSigmaPrime> Its either a masterpiece to some, or complete shit
[4:43:34] <zamzoph> DENOUDADEN
[4:43:38] <%Divryne> 83
[4:43:38] <$Dutchpotato> has a ton of 10's but some reviewers also hate it
[4:43:39] <+Lost_Zombie> Lots of 5/5 and some middle of the road ones
[4:43:43] <$cirocomic> Did you try putting the knife in the grave?
[4:43:43] <TwinBat> ign gave it a 6.8 lol
[4:43:48] <+Zaver88> IGN- 6.8
[4:43:48] <%Divryne> For Death Stranding on Metacritic.
[4:43:50] <Animorphimagi> Im out
[4:43:51] <MartinHadAMeme01> Every review is saying that the game has great cutscenes but average to bad cutscenes
[4:43:51] <%Divryne> 83
[4:43:53] <Coystick> some 10s and a few low scores surprisingly
[4:43:58] <MartinHadAMeme01> i meant gameplay
[4:43:58] <+Archphronimos> TWIST: There are endings B through Z but no ending A as a troll.
[4:43:59] <misterspotswood> 9/10 gamespot
[4:44:03] <LORDSPOOKLEKINS> IGN LUL
[4:44:08] <+XeroSigmaPrime> IGN can go sick my Kojima loving dick
[4:44:08] <Louie_Salmon> That's about what I expected
[4:44:21] <Sphincter_Spelunker> yeah sick kojima
[4:44:22] <%SoFarFetched> I assume the people who don't like it are those who don't like Kojima games. Like people who actually like Metal Gear Survive and not the Metal Gear Solid series.
[4:44:22] <+Duskysan> Saying “epic but boring”
[4:44:23] <$cirocomic> Did you try all the items in to the dig up grave?
[4:44:24] <NeroInfinite> Sick your dickhuh?
[4:44:24] <Coystick> Meta critic 81
[4:44:32] <PunishedMercer_> sick kojima dick bruh
[4:44:33] <%QueequegTheater> But the pillows are on the wrong side
[4:44:35] <+Deano8817> ultra early metacritic 83
[4:44:35] <pabloelenano2> @Louie_Salmon i found it wierd cuz if te statue of the king moves aain and is missing made sance that it was back in king room and thats why the armors arent there anny more
[4:44:36] <+Punchasaur> "every review"
[4:44:36] <+kaniasaurus> "both breathtaking and Boring" -TheVerge
[4:44:36] <42nfl19> I would say stop for now and continue tomorrow. And maybe contact the developer for hints.
[4:44:39] <misterspotswood> @Duskysan wow what an oxymoron
[4:44:48] <+Duskysan> Right?
[4:44:51] <SpicyCheeseNips> Epic but boring???? The fuck does that even mean?
[4:44:55] <Kazic5000> yupyupyupyupyup
[4:44:57] <Coystick> if the Meta Critic gets into the 70s then woooof
[4:45:00] <Laironx3> Epic but boring LUL
[4:45:03] <$lotharrio> Try giving Pat the not-big-numbers.
[4:45:06] <misterspotswood> its amazing but wow its boring, fuggin what
[4:45:14] <MavMarsh> probably means
[4:45:15] <%GabeSweetMan> NOT THE MINES
[4:45:19] <%SoFarFetched> @SpicyCheeseNips I assume "THE GRAPHICS LOOK FUCKING AMAZING.....but there's nothing to do"
[4:45:24] <MartinHadAMeme01> Epic but boring, sounds like an Arthouse film
[4:45:27] <MavMarsh> it's a good spectacle, but the gameplay is residentSleeper
[4:45:28] <LiquidMathew> Epic but Boring? so like good movie boring gameplay?
[4:45:32] <TheChillRoom> @SpicyCheeseNips It means it's gonna be one of those games you won't like if Journey wasn't your thing
[4:45:32] <+Deano8817> even the 100 reviews say they're sure it'll be divisive
[4:45:34] <misterspotswood> lol isnt the verge the one who did that dumb PC build with the guy who lisped?
[4:45:35] <+Punchasaur> using the word epic in 2019 MiniK
[4:45:39] <+Archphronimos> Epic but boring is what reviewers who need to be shooting or stabbing things constantly say
[4:45:43] <$Jack_of_No_Trades> Fire poker on campfire?
[4:45:43] <TheChillRoom> ^
[4:45:49] <Coystick> Divisive is interesting
[4:45:53] <ShimmerFairy> "epic but boring" probably means "it's a spectacle but it doesn't make you feel anything."
[4:46:05] <misterspotswood> "its big but i dont shoot bangs thing enough"
[4:46:08] <MartinHadAMeme01> Journey was only 3 hours though, Death Stranding is 50+
[4:46:19] <NumbusPlays> ohhhh
[4:46:20] <$lotharrio> Why does the Woolie puppet sound like Woolie... but the Pat puppet sounds like a dog with hiccups?
[4:46:23] <NumbusPlays> pat likes the king's key
[4:46:24] <+Punchasaur> epic but boring sounds like a DC movie
[4:46:27] <NumbusPlays> that makes sense
[4:46:29] <Niney_Who> "I've seen this key before" Despite him never leaving the courtyard, hmmm
[4:46:29] <PurePlatinumKyo> Is there anything you could use to set the paddle on fire and use it to light the campfire?
[4:46:29] <Dhurkst> literally "vague review title for clickbait"
[4:46:38] <Habblewater> The Toot is Agressive
[4:46:40] <0rond> "Death Stranding is not entertaining. As such, it fails as a video game, it fails as a narrative and it fails overall."
[4:46:50] <0rond> 3/10
[4:46:52] <0rond> wow
[4:47:16] <+Punchasaur> @0rond who said that?
[4:47:16] <SpicyCheeseNips> OUch
[4:47:17] <%CoolGuyMcHotPants_> oof
[4:47:18] <Morning_Asakura> big yikes
[4:47:19] <NeroInfinite> Ooof
[4:47:19] <+Deano8817> spicy
[4:47:25] <misterspotswood> i dont trust reviewers that much tbh
[4:47:28] <%g0atmeal> Art doesn't have to be entertaining to be good
[4:47:29] <0rond> PowerUp!
[4:47:36] <NeroInfinite> They're giving people who don't know Kojima games a kojima game
[4:47:39] <+Duskysan> That’s a hot take
[4:47:39] <SpicyCheeseNips> If it's that bad why even give it a 3?
[4:47:41] <Broand> Can you show things to the other npcs?
[4:47:42] <MartinHadAMeme01> Art isn't 50+ hours though
[4:47:43] <+Punchasaur> never heard of them
[4:47:44] <%SoFarFetched> did the map get darker?
[4:47:44] <+XeroSigmaPrime> "Death Stranding didnt suck my dick while resurrecting Hilter above a pit of lava, 2/10"
[4:47:44] <KaiserMario> Easy Allies liked it
[4:47:45] <zamzoph> but what do the I N F L U E N C E R S think?
[4:47:51] <Zaphire_Saucypants> I'll wait till I have the game in my hot lil hands till I judge Death Stranding.
[4:47:52] <Dhurkst> Entertainment isn't the only way a game can be a worthwhile experience.
[4:47:56] <$Bane_Kaikyo> I think I might've missed my dono being read...
[4:47:58] <$lotharrio> I'm gonna do what I didn't do with Indivisible, and watch Pat play Death Stranding, first.
[4:48:05] <Habblewater> The best review is your own experience
[4:48:05] <Kirby_Sauce> Why is pat playing roblox?
[4:48:06] <lordsdb> I kinda guess that DS (death stranding) wasn't going to be for everyone.
[4:48:15] <Ion_Laser> These reviews are just opinions
[4:48:17] <lordsdb> Also another DS gme
[4:48:19] <MartinHadAMeme01> haha poopoo peepee
[4:48:19] <$Bane_Kaikyo> Oh ok, sorry and thanks
[4:48:20] <Habblewater> lol, poop
[4:48:20] <silverira> stab pat with the knife
[4:48:21] <%Divryne> @PeachSaliva Destructoid said the game is the postman simulator we thought it was going to be. Too big and a LOT of downtime.
[4:48:21] <misterspotswood> 81 on MC tho
[4:48:22] <Ion_Laser> Like all reviews
[4:48:25] <Sphincter_Spelunker> Metabolism my guy
[4:48:28] <+wandorx_x> pregnant
[4:48:30] <TheChillRoom> @0rond See, I read that and hear "This game was not made for ME and I am MAD about it like a good games journalist should be"
[4:48:31] <Morning_Asakura> easy allies is the only opinions i care about
[4:48:36] <+HotBloodedHero> Honestly the complete polarization gives me confidence in Death Stranding having future significance somehow. Like MGS 2.
[4:48:37] <Zaphire_Saucypants> feels like you've done everything there is to do.
[4:48:42] <$Jack_of_No_Trades> try fire poker on campfire just for my sanity
[4:48:43] <ryderbootz> man i just wanna be norman reedus pounding down monsters while role playing the courier from F:NV, why do reviewers not get this?
[4:48:44] <+Duskysan> “But that’s just like, your opinion man”
[4:48:44] <MasterDecoder> Poker in fire is something I'd assume
[4:48:47] <misterspotswood> IGN japan says its a 95
[4:48:49] <hntronium> edge wuggin time
[4:48:51] <%g0atmeal> Try the konami code in every single room
[4:48:51] <MavMarsh> with all the hype leading up to it though i'm worried about the backlash that DS isn't the god's gift to earth people expected
[4:48:53] <Ultra_Pancake> Start drinkin metamucil.
[4:48:57] <$cirocomic> Did you try the items in the grave?
[4:48:58] <+thefakeh> try entering the boss lair now that youve opened the grave?
[4:49:03] <Louie_Salmon> Gonna need more people to actually figure this shit out so we can give advice
[4:49:04] <+Punchasaur> I need consistent reviews so I can form an opinion without experiencing it for myself and be on the right side of the internet bandwagon BabyRage
[4:49:13] <KaiserMario> It's polarizing, so obviously you'd have to look for reviewers with similar tastes for this one... So I'm curious for what pat and Woolie think after playing
[4:49:15] <Dr_Mooose> I had the same reaction too
[4:49:35] <%TheMattman1313> @PeachSaliva Check out Shy's recent vid
[4:49:36] <Habblewater> a surrogate
[4:49:41] <pabloelenano2> @Punchasaur the fear is on paying the monney and not enjoying the product
[4:49:49] <ShimmerFairy> It's funny seeing people try to invalidate every review they don't like.
[4:49:51] <SpicyCheeseNips> Why WOULDN'T you have a replica of your own skeleton?
[4:49:51] <Kirby_Sauce> Shy has it you ninnies
[4:49:52] <VestigeOuroboros> I want to draw a toilet skeleton now, that's upsetting.
[4:49:52] <%Breakfast_Megapowers> Cause you'd get Bonely Pat Kappa
[4:49:53] <Zaphire_Saucypants> Isn't a toilet ALREADY a skeleton?
[4:49:53] <%depressed_skeleton> Please don't talk about my people like this.
[4:49:58] <+XeroSigmaPrime> @PeachSaliva Alot of reviewers RUSHED the game and missed a HUGE gameplay part that is freaking AWESOME
[4:49:59] <+Hinasil> Guys let's ask what resetera thinks about Death Stranding first before forming an opinion
[4:50:01] <MartinHadAMeme01> Will Woolie be able to finish Death Stranding? it's 50+ hours and doesn't have fighting game combos Kappa
[4:50:02] <%AncelDeLambert> wattup it me
[4:50:04] <%depressed_skeleton> WOW
[4:50:06] <Sphincter_Spelunker> I care about Shelmo
[4:50:06] <WeebFever> Pat you're an ORGANIC immortal toilet?
[4:50:09] <Baeltyr> i miss shellmo
[4:50:14] <Sphincter_Spelunker> His name is Homer :(
[4:50:16] <%AncelDeLambert> Don't lie, Sphincter
[4:50:18] <+El8oney> @PeachSaliva More importantly would you go to the afterlife as a toilet?
[4:50:21] <+Archphronimos> If Pat comes back "as a toilet" does that mean it's a toilet made out of meat and bone?
[4:50:24] <TheChillRoom> @KaiserMario That seems like the best bet if anyone was going to trust a reviewer at all with a game that seems this personal
[4:50:27] <+primax104> probably also just tired
[4:50:27] <Kirby_Sauce> The SUN is DOWN
[4:50:28] <Niney_Who> Snake is normal enemy
[4:50:31] <Personified134> shoot the snake fucking dead
[4:50:32] <Youwereeatenbyalid> @peachsaliva recheck the gazebo?
[4:50:33] <+allups> good now i only have to choose between starwars and RD 2
[4:50:37] <Habblewater> G U N
[4:50:39] <+Blargimazombie> Lake Snake
[4:50:39] <bevyrage> SNAKE IN THE LAKE! o D o]!
[4:50:50] <+Jekado> snake is scared of gun
[4:50:51] <misterspotswood> easy there, sephiroth
[4:50:54] <Coystick> Daaaaarling~
[4:50:55] <Valdorick> welcome to the fuckbox
[4:50:57] <$lotharrio> Right in the dick!
[4:50:59] <MavMarsh> wtf that snake just disappears
[4:51:01] <Zaphire_Saucypants> hahahaha
[4:51:01] <TwinBat> run woolie
[4:51:02] <Trash_leviathan> daaarling
[4:51:02] <artificiallynatural> run woolie!
[4:51:03] <Kazic5000> MAP D:
[4:51:04] <%GabeSweetMan> *benny hill music*
[4:51:07] <Niney_Who> You can kill it, I have, but it Yields nothing
[4:51:09] <heartlesshealer> that turning, dang
[4:51:09] <SpicyCheeseNips> Just another day in Grenada for Woolie!
[4:51:09] <Kirby_Sauce> Danger rope
[4:51:10] <Habblewater> gonna get your shit pushed in by this asshole serpent
[4:51:11] <Zaphire_Saucypants> something really funny bout that
[4:51:12] <hntronium> its hitstun is strong
[4:51:13] <+Punchasaur> @shimmerfairy I get that but I think people put way too much stock into reviews
[4:51:13] <MartinHadAMeme01> woolie hates trouser snakes
[4:51:14] <%wulfsbane_jolt> HE'S TOO FAST
[4:51:22] <Zaphire_Saucypants> Same!
[4:51:24] <$Agami23> make the snake eat its own ass to turn it into a oroboros
[4:51:26] <Niney_Who> Maybe kill something with it
[4:51:29] <garagon31> stab yourself
[4:51:29] <$lotharrio> M-masaka!
[4:51:30] <Niney_Who> That's all I got
[4:51:30] <Youwereeatenbyalid> Gazebo?
[4:51:33] <$lotharrio> BAKANA!
[4:51:37] <WeebFever> stab the lonely statue?
[4:51:41] <$cirocomic> Dagger in grave?
[4:51:42] <KaiserMario> Honestly, Death Stranding gives me Deadly Premonition vibes... Takes a certain type of personality and mindset to enjoy it
[4:51:43] <%SoFarFetched> and 9 items seem to be missing
[4:51:44] <Dhurkst> Elmo is FOCUSED
[4:51:46] <+Punchasaur> this is coming from someone who is very skeptical of death Stranding
[4:51:46] <neck_bear> goo was mentioned with the living armors
[4:51:46] <Youwereeatenbyalid> ...
[4:51:46] <+Jekado> did you need the bat with something?
[4:51:49] <misterspotswood> @WeebFever statue is gone
[4:51:49] <MavMarsh> stab pat with the aids dagger
[4:51:51] <+FrostMass22> Could you imagine if they did all this only to learn that you can only get 1 of 2 endings per playthrough?
[4:51:51] <wsintai> @PeachSaliva Stab Pat with it? I dunno
[4:51:51] <Louie_Salmon> Kill an enemy in a certain place?
[4:51:53] <Niney_Who> Slightly better than fists
[4:51:55] <BeefyQueefer> shoot the bonfire to start it? it's a longshot.
[4:51:55] <Valdorick> Stab YOURSELF with it (Ingamepat)
[4:51:59] <WeebFever> Oh, dang, I'm big dumb
[4:52:00] <Youwereeatenbyalid> @peachsaliva Just stab pat with it?
[4:52:01] <Kazic5000> Can you go back to the dust in the machine place and shank the monster?
[4:52:02] <Tarviti> It had goo and so did the living armors
[4:52:08] <PurePlatinumKyo> Is there anywhere you could find fire to transfer to the campfire...? I can't remember if there's a LIT fireplace anywhere in the castle.
[4:52:09] <$lotharrio> Oh god...
[4:52:14] <+Jekado> no they can't go there
[4:52:18] <DedlokPM> @Kazic5000 the area was walled off
[4:52:20] <$lotharrio> Can you shoot Pat?
[4:52:20] <absolute_cagemony> stab pat with rusty sryinge
[4:52:21] <+Jekado> dust place is sealed
[4:52:22] <Louie_Salmon> @frostmass22 Well, they at least learned a bunch of shit
[4:52:23] <MartinHadAMeme01> that spider noise sounds like a Jerma mini-dispenser noise
[4:52:26] <Sphincter_Spelunker> fire poker
[4:52:29] <Sokumotanaka> what about the fountain?
[4:52:31] <bevyrage> bunch of torches but you can't really deal with them
[4:52:32] <$Bane_Kaikyo> THE ROOT
[4:52:34] <Niney_Who> Fire poker isn't a torch guys
[4:52:35] <%SoFarFetched> I feel like the campfire is just there as an easter egg
[4:52:36] <$lotharrio> Because Pat respects GUN
[4:52:42] <wsintai> @PeachSaliva The Bat, the Root, or the Fire Poker
[4:52:46] <%QueequegTheater> burn that baby
[4:52:48] <+Leon_Spencer> is the dagger a silent hill 2 reference?
[4:52:48] <%depressed_skeleton> the root is on fire
[4:52:50] <LeftOverPizza13> so is this the story of how they got castle super beast
[4:53:11] <+XeroSigmaPrime> Death Stranding feels ALOT like MGS2
[4:53:18] <$lotharrio> The spider is the super beast that they defeated to gain a castle.
[4:53:24] <+primax104> any indication of what the dust in the machine is?
[4:53:25] <+Punchasaur> the spider sounds like a sound effect used in a low quality sfm porn
[4:53:32] <%SoFarFetched> nothing so far
[4:53:34] <absolute_cagemony> Metal Gear Stranding
[4:53:37] <KaiserMario> I got it! "Death Stranding is Deadly Premonition with AAA money on it"
[4:53:45] <%QueequegTheater> ^
[4:53:49] <Sphincter_Spelunker> @Punchasaur coxWat
[4:53:51] <Habblewater> Cats can totally do both
[4:53:57] <+Blargimazombie> The real Castle Super Beast was the friends we killed along the way
[4:53:58] <Dhurkst> @KaiserMario Sounds like GOAT
[4:54:05] <MartinHadAMeme01> Deadly Premonition isn't 60 hours though
[4:54:11] <Youwereeatenbyalid> Fuck why are we all so collectively dumb
[4:54:15] <absolute_cagemony> The real castle superbeast was Elmo
[4:54:18] <MartinHadAMeme01> also it's dumb, not pretentious
[4:54:20] <$Agami23> wait.
[4:54:27] <%depressed_skeleton> touch
[4:54:28] <$Agami23> there was another path too!
[4:54:28] <MasterDecoder> What happen with the other directions?
[4:54:33] <%wulfsbane_jolt> Uh oh
[4:54:34] <+Punchasaur> @martinhadameme01 is it 50 or 60? make up your mind lol
[4:54:34] <Personified134> monkaW
[4:54:35] <%SoFarFetched> they circled around
[4:54:35] <ShadeTheNovice> thats the circle of tunnels
[4:54:40] <42nfl19> @PeachSaliva Try the Dust in Machines guy but avoid the center of teh water?
[4:54:41] <SpicyCheeseNips> maaaaan
[4:54:42] <TheChillRoom> @KaiserMario Deadly Premonition X Journey as written by Kojima. I'm destined to eat it up.
[4:54:43] <+Duskysan> I love that there’s over 1000 of us here and we still haven’t figured it out
[4:54:44] <%wulfsbane_jolt> oh.
[4:54:44] <Kazic5000> What is this ceiling spaghetti?
[4:54:54] <MavMarsh> i just got reminded of how fixed camera angles really aid the horror atmosphere
[4:54:56] <wsintai> @42nfl19 The door they took to go there noi longer exists
[4:54:56] <Desertfishing> probably gotta restart from scratch
[4:54:57] <Personified134> the ceiling spaghetti gave us ending B
[4:54:58] <MavMarsh> this is some good shit
[4:54:58] <Dhurkst> @MartinHadAMeme01 Artistic doesn't mean pretentious, bruh
[4:55:00] <MartinHadAMeme01> @Punchasaur reviews say 50+ for main story
[4:55:07] <Trash_leviathan> have you tried using the dagger on the roots
[4:55:08] <Pompadourius> I'm just using this to grind up my mining in FFXIV and it's doing just fine. :D
[4:55:14] <$Agami23> the way to the roots, if you go backwards the bath splits. has it always been like that?
[4:55:14] <%SoFarFetched> cant combine items
[4:55:17] <ZComiX> i0-have you trued an older save and kill the red moonster instead?
[4:55:20] <MartinHadAMeme01> @Dhurkst reviews are literally say that it's pretentious, i agree with you though
[4:55:20] <misterspotswood> gibe babby to roots?
[4:55:20] <hntronium> looks like it just loops
[4:55:26] <$Jack_of_No_Trades> is the potato a behelit?
[4:55:27] <%TheMattman1313> What if you have to start over to get Ending A via killing the red monster?
[4:55:29] <Personified134> @PeachSaliva what if we take the knife to the grave specifically where it says "murderer"
[4:55:30] <NeroInfinite> blanished
[4:55:33] <Sphincter_Spelunker> @misterspotswood that was ending b
[4:55:37] <$cirocomic> Grave?
[4:55:37] <Sphincter_Spelunker> Blanished
[4:55:39] <tigerfang86> huge blanishment
[4:55:40] <misterspotswood> well then
[4:55:41] <ZComiX> Have you tried an old save before banished AND kill THE MONSTER?
[4:55:42] <%SoFarFetched> Only thing you can do is interact with people or things with an item.
[4:55:48] <Youwereeatenbyalid> I think we're out of good ideas
[4:55:50] <Dhurkst> @MartinHadAMeme01 Game journalists aren't exactly reliable review sources
[4:55:52] <KaiserMario> @MartinHadAMeme01 Dhurkst has a point, being artistic and pretentious often go hand in hand
[4:55:53] <absolute_cagemony> We're all too stupid, together.
[4:55:53] <Mige_> it must be a bug
[4:55:55] <misterspotswood> give knife to roots?
[4:55:58] <+HotBloodedHero> Dagger on the grave?
[4:56:05] <+Punchasaur> @martinhadameme01 yeah but you're repeating the same thing but adding 5 hours every time
[4:56:06] <Broand> What if the game is bugged until you restart the game proper?
[4:56:06] <$cirocomic> Dagger grave?
[4:56:07] <42nfl19> Have you tried to use the items on the NPCs?
[4:56:12] <SpicyCheeseNips> wut

[4:58:50] <Silent_Fyraena> Rise down!
[4:58:53] <KaiserMario> @Dhurkst But the intent is the same, that's what I mean, if the game is trying too hard, might come off as pretentious... probably does and I don't think it's the end of the world
[4:58:59] <%depressed_skeleton> Gamers rise up, break the glass ceiling
[4:59:02] <%QueequegTheater> LET THEM EAT RICE
[4:59:03] <$thewhiterice92> Probably in one of the five places where people are rioting
[4:59:03] <Kirby_Sauce> More like shaq's a drow, amirite?
[4:59:12] <misterspotswood> @Dao_Puppy mexico in some parts
[4:59:23] <Valdorick> I can't believe Paige said she wants to eat the poor
[4:59:23] <Dhurkst> @KaiserMario Ah, I see what you mean
[4:59:27] <misterspotswood> paige cant put out a gospel album
[4:59:27] <Kirby_Sauce> He's making his own tear gas
[4:59:28] <bear_breaker20> gamers cant rise too much gout
[4:59:29] <MasterDecoder> Kanye's a fuck
[4:59:31] <MartinHadAMeme01> I CHOSE NOT TO BE A GAMER
[4:59:34] <Habblewater> I knooooow
[4:59:36] <+Punchasaur> "poor kids are just as smart as white kids" - Paige
[4:59:38] <%QueequegTheater> Man, he used to be good at music
[4:59:38] <tigerfang86> I can believe that
[4:59:39] <billyup00> i'm sure it's tender
[4:59:40] <Dao_Puppy> Neither did Marie Antoinnete, didn't help her.
[4:59:40] <Hydrapissed> Eat the rich

[4:59:44] <%depressed_skeleton> better the poor than the sexy sexy skeletons.

[4:59:45] <%ShockzNDrawe> Fish eat fish
[4:59:45] <+Blargimazombie> Kanye is so overrated IMO
[4:59:47] <NumbusPlays> I can't believe Paige wrote A Modest Proposal
[4:59:50] <Kazic5000> The poor are plentiful and cheap.
[4:59:51] <%nofestu2> I cant believe Paige hates Hong Kong
[4:59:52] <Yadogari> If poor people can't be food what good are they?
[4:59:54] <%depressed_skeleton> eyes bad
[4:59:55] <$Agami23> can you ever?
[4:59:57] <Kirby_Sauce> So he can help fight the dissidents
[4:59:59] <$Jack_of_No_Trades> In hindsight we should have seen this coming
[5:00:00] <Decsevm> paige out of context is great
[5:00:05] <absolute_cagemony> I can't believe Paige is dead.
[5:00:05] <Admiral_PopnFresh> eat only the poor who have consented octoImpacto
[5:00:05] <+FrostMass22> I can't believe that Paige supports China
[5:00:06] <%QueequegTheater> @PeachSaliva I choose to remember the Kanye who made Power.
[5:00:08] <+Punchasaur> BECAUSE YOU NEED TO SEE THE EYE DOCTOR
[5:00:11] <MasterDecoder> @Punchasaur Damn
[5:00:11] <justaguy3> Paige burgers whit more poor pepole included
[5:00:27] <+Jekado> @Yadogari you can always hunt the poor for sport

[5:01:14] <$Jack_of_No_Trades> Probably to save on out of network text costs
[5:01:26] <%ShockzNDrawe> I am the least cool person, Pat called me dumb one time that means I'me the biggest not cool
[5:01:31] <%wulfsbane_jolt> OwO
[5:01:34] <Habblewater> THE L I N E
[5:01:35] <Niney_Who> @PeachSaliva Fun Fact: Sony was going to make the 2017 My Little Pony movie, and were essentially gonna sonic/smurf it by making it a Reverse Isekai. Thankfully Hasbro cut ties and just produced it on their own.
[5:01:40] <TheChillRoom> @KaiserMario On the other hand, Sony gave up exclusivity on both Crash and Spyro.
[5:01:51] <Admiral_PopnFresh> octoVore
[5:01:51] <Habblewater> HOLD ON
[5:01:57] <BeefyQueefer> BIG CHEW for smol gril

[5:02:03] <%QueequegTheater> @ShockzNDrawe Please, if he hasn't called you dumb then you don't matter. That's a badge of honor round these parts
[5:02:05] <CatmanIX> @Niney_Who still kinda reverse isejai though, no?

[5:04:08] <TheChillRoom> @KaiserMario Yeah. I see what you mean. It's just weird. And I guess the real wrench in all of this is that we have yet to see a Demon's Souls or Bloodborne port
[5:04:10] <%zamatermort> If Pat is Cranky, then who is construct?

[5:06:40] <%GabeSweetMan> Yeah start sending in donations talking about how cancer ruined your family's lives.
[5:06:40] <bear_breaker20> fuckiiiiiiiiiin
[5:06:40] <CherrieVelvet> oh no
[5:06:41] <%QueequegTheater> LUL
[5:06:44] <Smaenus> @PeachSaliva You are literally the only person who has said my name correctly, not once, but twice
[5:06:46] <%depressed_skeleton> he is an ARTIST
[5:06:48] <Ion_Laser> LUL
[5:06:48] <$Dutchpotato> who is this guy kojima Kappa
[5:06:50] <Frostydough1> ...and start the clock
[5:06:50] <+DRAGKUDO> what's so confusing about that
[5:06:52] <%Divryne> The final boss probably involves injecting Pat with air using a syringe.
[5:06:53] <MartinHadAMeme01> you now understand what woolie went through when he bugtested
[5:06:56] <%depressed_skeleton> elmo scream
[5:06:56] <Trash_leviathan> there was never a game here
[5:06:58] <+thefakeh> look at these fukken speedrun strats
[5:06:58] <+Blargimazombie> Elmo yell
[5:07:00] <ZComiX> LOOOK AT THAT CLIP STRAT
[5:07:01] <TheChillRoom> @KaiserMario Yeah, that makes sense. But we're also able to see that they do timed exclusivity too, which is apparently what happened with Detroit
[5:07:14] <evbites> (C)razy talk
[5:07:15] <Smaenus> Yeyeye
[5:07:19] <Sphincter_Spelunker> Smay-nus?
[5:07:20] <%GabeSweetMan> Unoptimal RUN RUINED
[5:07:20] <Frostydough1> Guys anyone know if this is an out of bounds round?
[5:07:26] <Silent_Fyraena> Smelmo strikes
[5:07:27] <+Punchasaur> Woolie got paid less for QA
[5:07:30] <+Blargimazombie> Yell at the poop
[5:07:40] <%depressed_skeleton> Kiss golem.
[5:07:41] <%wulfsbane_jolt> you didn't get it
[5:07:48] <NeroInfinite> Elmo yells at his own poop
[5:07:49] <TheChillRoom> And might also be what we're seeing with Death Stranding, but now they're allowed to be forward with it since the games climate is such that the average gamer understands timed exclusivity now
[5:07:56] <Smaenus> Yup, it's a dumb play on my real name, long story
[5:08:15] <CherrieVelvet> oh
[5:08:17] <Kirby_Sauce> Unlock the true ending by completing ending c, ending s, ending b in that order.
[5:08:20] <KaiserMario> @TheChillRoom True, I'm still baffled that Detroit was an exclusive at first... I'd never put my money on David Cage LUL
[5:08:23] <Habblewater> Sam Anus is your name then
[5:08:28] <%Divryne> B FOR BAD.
[5:08:29] <Trash_leviathan> this game was cursed by a witch
[5:08:30] <+Punchasaur> he scream at own ass
[5:08:31] <heartlesshealer> It locks you into Blanishment is what he's saying
[5:08:31] <$Jack_of_No_Trades> That makes sense
[5:08:33] <MasterDecoder> Super Beast, Super Beat, Speedrun Castle Super Beast, get a new ending at the least, Speedrun Castle Super Beast @PeachSaliva
[5:08:35] <ShimmerFairy> Wait... the Choices Matter?!?!?
[5:08:40] <absolute_cagemony> Ruin Dagger.... Ruin Sentinal.... does this game take place in the Dark Souls 2 universe?
[5:08:44] <VestigeOuroboros> Is it really a good ending if you use your virtual best friend to kill virtual you
[5:08:45] <Smaenus> @Habblewater You actually summarized the entire joke I'm impressed LUL
[5:08:45] <%supersugoisenpai1> How do we get the dog ending?
[5:08:46] <ryderbootz> B for BASIC sksksksksksksk
[5:08:48] <Valdorick> If you enter the king's room with a key instead of the passage, the dagger gets ruined.
[5:08:51] <%g0atmeal> Why does the dagger lock you into something that has nothing to do with the dagger?
[5:09:02] <MartinHadAMeme01> @TheChillRoom im pretty sure the only guaranteed constriction with PlayStation exclusives is that whether timed or not, if it was funded by sony, it can only go on PV
[5:09:03] <+allups> no to small tho
[5:09:04] <Youwereeatenbyalid> This game is gonna need a few patches
[5:09:05] <%nofestu2> Much wee

[5:09:34] <@PinkieTheEerie> I promies
[5:09:38] <Smaenus> @Habblewater Real big brain hours
[5:09:44] <TheChillRoom> @KaiserMario Detroit is an interesting situation unto itself where David Cage is concerned. It's the project where he's had the least hands on influence which is part of why parts of it where as good as they were? Also that's a good working theory re: Sony exclusivity
[5:09:44] <%GabeSweetMan> Congrats Shrarpert!
[5:09:45] <+Punchasaur> @ryderbootz skiss skiss skiss - Dr Phil

[5:11:11] <%depressed_skeleton> @PeachSaliva My mum just came out of the hospital too, They thought they found a hole in her Bowel. But shes ok! She was very scared.
[5:11:11] <Habblewater> NO DEADPOOL ON PAIGE
[5:11:19] <Sphincter_Spelunker> but if they win, who collects
[5:11:19] <Admiral_PopnFresh> you should tell them that you're praying for them Kappa
[5:11:24] <awalr> it's the ONLY way
[5:11:27] <Louie_Salmon> @mainman_jonadiah It's turning out to be a very mysterious jogo
[5:11:27] <%GabeSweetMan> Place bets and then tell them you and 3 congregations are praying for them. Kappa
[5:11:27] <Valdorick> (oh god this ending is amazing)
[5:11:28] <bear_breaker20> we have to

[5:12:34] <ShadeTheNovice> LUL
[5:12:35] <KaiserMario> @TheChillRoom I'm guessing for Demons Souls and Bloodborne, they might already put their money on IPs like LoU2, Tsushima, Death Stranding, maybeSpider Man 2 and GoW2... So they might be spreaded too thin for more

[5:18:14] <Habblewater> We heard pat dump the paint multiple times right?
[5:18:15] <$Dutchpotato> did u turn on the light?
[5:18:19] <$Bane_Kaikyo> I mean for real, with only 3 months of workin on it there is a lot of technically impressive shit in this fuck.... I mean programming for the Spiders to evade the light sources is probably really tough on it's own. Add multiple endings, eerie atmosphere that doesn't rely on cheap jumpscares, riddles and intrigue, and a bucket load of charm.... This is legit impressive
[5:18:19] <Niney_Who> you gotta turn on the lights pat
[5:18:23] <+HotBloodedHero> Time to Bridge!
[5:18:24] <Rain_Mage> Love that Kronos painting

[5:19:26] <%ShineTheDiamond> <3
[5:19:27] <Decsevm> Subnautica is a great game and that is basically just wandering around

[5:19:52] <YamadaZero> Death Stranding reviewed as well as I expected it to.
[5:19:52] <MartinHadAMeme01> this one review is the worse thing i've ever read and it makes me want to not play death stranding "Death Stranding is a game about connection, and it connects not only every character of the game but also every gamer together. It's a masterpiece with great philosophy thoughts and combines great storytelling with innovative gameplay."
[5:19:54] <hoenhime344> cant drive in the ocean dummy
[5:19:55] <iambqb> I want it to really mess with you and give a number, like Ending 4
[5:19:56] <TheArrow_> what if you get ending b 2
[5:19:57] <heartlesshealer> stunlock avoided
[5:19:59] <Kazic5000> In the event of an emergency, Emlo can be used as a floatation device.

[5:21:51] <Niney_Who> @PeachSaliva It's hinted that Pat is doing this, because when you showed him the King Key, he says how it's Familiar, despite him never leaving the Courtyard. Allegedly.

[5:28:02] <YamadaZero> Shoot when it goes to fire at you in the distance.
[5:28:04] <$Agami23> i just realized, it kinda looks like a butterfly knife. doesen't pat love knives?
[5:28:07] <0rond> don't let it boop you, run so it boops the ground and shoot it while it's down
[5:28:11] <%GabeSweetMan> @Jekado Only if it was the original intention.
[5:28:13] <Niney_Who> Either get distance or hide
[5:28:14] <+Okosisi89> whaaaat the fuck.
[5:28:14] <Kazic5000> It shoots mini eyeballs. Neat.,
[5:28:15] <ZComiX> when it is searching it isnt spinning hid in the shadows and shoot ti from behind
[5:28:18] <+Okosisi89> I left for like 20 minutes.
[5:28:19] <Admiral_PopnFresh> well this is a boss...
[5:28:19] <%ShockzNDrawe> @PeachSaliva does it only spin if it sees you? maybe try to get out of it's line of sight?
[5:28:37] <MainMan_Jonadiah> @Okosisi89 Yeah, you missed a little bit
[5:28:38] <+Jekado> this is a boss

[5:28:56] <Dhurkst> Stealth boss! Vulkan Raven!
[5:28:57] <Valdorick> You'll know when its shot
[5:28:59] <Smaenus> It has like a spotlight vision cone by the looks of it
[5:28:59] <Niney_Who> Otherwise its spin blocks it
[5:29:01] <+Jekado> its an eye not a ear
[5:29:05] <Dr_Mooose> is the line of sight 360, or 180?
[5:29:05] <Haarute> sneak from behind it when it loses track of you

[5:31:42] <MainMan_Jonadiah> @ledgefiendd Yeah, this is Pat's true form... Or something
[5:31:45] <+Jekado> this game is the realist
[5:31:49] <%ThePuddingDead> GET UP ON THE HYDRAS BACK
[5:31:50] <%Breakfast_Megapowers> Is this form THE Angriest Pat?
[5:31:52] <Sokumotanaka> The angriest eye, he's gonna judge my shit taste in video games! aaaah!
[5:31:54] <Admiral_PopnFresh> octoGun octoKnife octoGun octoKnife octoGun octoKnife
[5:31:56] <+ledgefiendd> the logical conclusion
[5:31:58] <Valdorick> suck
[5:32:01] <+ledgefiendd> thanks
[5:32:02] <+DRAGKUDO> this place kinda reminds me of the amala network
[5:32:07] <+ledgefiendd> ppmdG
[5:32:08] <Personified134> too far?
[5:32:09] <Smaenus> Think it was too far maybe?
[5:32:10] <evbites> might reed a lock on display option
[5:32:15] <Kazic5000> God this lighting is just ChefFrank 💋
[5:32:18] <MainMan_Jonadiah> This reminds me a lot of Control, actually
[5:32:21] <+HotBloodedHero> It spins to deflect if it sees you
[5:32:21] <FiachraDonovan> @DRAGKUDO It is a bit like it
[5:32:22] <%ThePuddingDead> cameras being a shit
[5:32:27] <%ThePuddingDead> but thats cool tho
[5:32:27] <Personified134> this game is hyper cursed
[5:32:29] <+VantomPayne> "Montreal Man kills the evangelion angel version of himself on stream" Nov, 1 2019
[5:32:36] <+Punchasaur> its the foundation from control
[5:32:38] <Sokumotanaka> octoGun_SG
[5:32:48] <Kirby_Sauce> @MainMan_Jonadiah how? in that pat keeps messing up?
[5:32:53] <+Archphronimos> This must be "THE IDEA OF ANGRIESTPAT" kinda like the Idea of Evil in Berserk.
[5:33:03] <KaiserMario> Too far
[5:33:04] <Niney_Who> It has short range
[5:33:09] <%wulfsbane_jolt> hit twice?
[5:33:11] <+Jekado> gun range is pretty bad
[5:33:13] <Zaphire_Saucypants> I think the gunshot is alerting it. You're shooting too far away
[5:33:13] <MainMan_Jonadiah> @Kirby_Sauce Lol, that too. I just meant like the red and the way the room looks, and all that.
[5:33:16] <0rond> the angriestestpat
[5:33:17] <+Jekado> but it makes sense for the gun type
[5:33:22] <%GabeSweetMan> Dang....
[5:33:23] <lloyddboy> F
[5:33:25] <0rond> boop'd
[5:33:25] <%wulfsbane_jolt> it looks like it gets stunned
[5:33:25] <Dr_Mooose> bonk
[5:33:26] <$Jack_of_No_Trades> it is a dragon, a short blunderbuss
[5:33:29] <Habblewater> You can do it Pat
[5:33:31] <Louie_Salmon> It has better range than you'd think, but less than you'd hope.
[5:33:33] <Shwepie> The viewers killed Woolie.
[5:33:35] <%GabeSweetMan> Maybe get another stash of bullets first?
[5:33:35] <Ion_Laser> F
[5:33:38] <Admiral_PopnFresh> child
[5:33:42] <Sokumotanaka> you scared it
[5:33:43] <Kazic5000> I wish there were a way to skip the cutscene.
[5:33:43] <%ShockzNDrawe> And so Woolie succumbed to the Angriest of Pats to the head
[5:33:45] <Personified134> oh I just realized we have skinhead pat tonight
[5:33:47] <+Punchasaur> flintlock
[5:33:47] <rytisone> use gunslinger style
[5:33:47] <%depressed_skeleton> We need woolie to do this
[5:33:50] <Dhurkst> literally a Silent Hill boss
[5:33:53] <Trash_leviathan> is this ending A or C
[5:33:56] <Personified134> we don't know
[5:33:59] <+Jekado> ironic "pats true enemy is himself"
[5:34:00] <%CoolGuyMcHotPants_> you got this buddy
[5:34:00] <DavidSanChan> but Pat is slightly larger than a baby
[5:34:00] <MainMan_Jonadiah> Remerai was like "Wait till you see the REAL boss"
[5:34:02] <$Dutchpotato> ending D @Trash_leviathan
[5:34:03] <KaiserMario> Pat is tired, gib 'im a break!
[5:34:06] <ryderbootz> we ever figure out what the BK on the side of the gun stands for?
[5:34:06] <+ledgefiendd> yes
[5:34:06] <$Dutchpotato> Kappa
[5:34:11] <%Breakfast_Megapowers> Paige would've beaten this like the God in Bloodborne
[5:34:17] <%wulfsbane_jolt> no, you can't do it, you'll never do it (c'mon Crazy Talk...)
[5:34:18] <0rond> what are you going to do now woolie eh? now YOU ARE THE TANK CONTROLS
[5:34:22] <+Archphronimos> So yeah that's AngriestPat that you must defeat to save Pat...ron.
[5:34:22] <%theshillman> time to go yell at the bank, see you stream
[5:34:26] <Habblewater> Woopat will figure it out
[5:34:34] <billyup00> yay
[5:34:36] <$Dutchpotato> nice
[5:34:42] <HyperionXV> I am enjoying that this is Woolie vs a Kirby final boss.
[5:34:44] <+fingalights> For babies
[5:34:45] <+DRAGKUDO> Patch in a Woolie mode that doesn't have tank controls
[5:34:46] <Sphincter_Spelunker> yay me
[5:34:47] <%depressed_skeleton> 3 is good for once
[5:34:53] <Kirby_Sauce> @PeachSaliva hey pat, are you a toilet? cause this boss keeps shitting on you!
[5:34:54] <LeftOverPizza13> eyeballs HATE getting stabbed
[5:34:58] <Smaenus> 4?

[5:35:02] <MainMan_Jonadiah> Make that a gif
[5:35:02] <Youwereeatenbyalid> Remerai, you might need to give this some more telegraphing
[5:35:07] <Habblewater> Gotta blat it right in the arsehole
[5:35:11] <+Punchasaur> nah silent hill bosses make you more uncomfortably horny
[5:35:14] <+Archphronimos> So I'm not a big player of horror games but this seems legit amazing for a boss.
[5:35:16] <ZComiX> im very confused about the story tho bc whatis the root? the blacksmith? the workshop? WHAT DOES TI ALL MEAN?
[5:35:17] <+Jekado> this is how i would see woolie fighting an ultimate evil
[5:35:22] <+Jekado> running around in circles
[5:35:31] <MavMarsh> just wait behind a pillar with the gun up
[5:35:40] <ZComiX> where is vaati when you need him
[5:35:42] <MainMan_Jonadiah> Gotta lame out that cosmic horror like it's Cross Tekken

[5:41:54] <%ThePuddingDead> then back off
[5:41:56] <%CoolGuyMcHotPants_> good thing this giant eyeball has no object permanence

[5:49:59] <Sokumotanaka> It's four in the morn you fucks
[5:50:04] <%wulfsbane_jolt> drop your GUN
[5:50:05] <TheChillRoom> Packsetting 100% sounds like somebody's phone trying their best to autocorrect
[5:50:15] <+fingalights> Is the eye deaf?
[5:50:15] <$Jack_of_No_Trades> Hey Paige how is Elmo? Look at Elmo and tell me how he is
[5:50:19] <MavMarsh> the jank is just a gameplay feature
[5:50:19] <0rond> btw remrei, i'd recommand attaching the boss wake up to number of hits rather than time
[5:50:20] <%GabeSweetMan> You're that dumb eyeball Pat.
[5:50:21] <+BeatBoxersDevMike> This is a metaphor for Pat's disgust with red bars
[5:50:23] <MavMarsh> look at the skillz needed
[5:50:24] <+GenesisPatton> Are the controls Tank Controls like early Resident Evil games?
[5:50:25] <twistedj3ster> ...How are you two still up?
[5:50:26] <+Punchasaur> @Sphincter_Spelunker Kappa
[5:50:28] <tigerfang86> that's YOUR dumb eyeball god
[5:50:29] <Habblewater> YOU CAN DO IT
[5:50:36] <%GabeSweetMan> That gun startup and cooldown is ABSURD.
[5:50:41] <%ThePuddingDead> nope
[5:50:43] <Dao_Puppy> I get it. Remi is secretly Cliffy B, this game is his way of ruining Pat's life.
[5:50:46] <MavMarsh> there's no quick turn so not quite resident evil
[5:50:48] <0rond> pat if you close your eyes your eyeball won't be able to see anything
[5:50:50] <+Jekado> that gun animation so slow it should require you to uninstall and reinstall the game to reload it
[5:50:53] <%GabeSweetMan> YEYEYE

[5:58:42] <%GabeSweetMan> Backseat Witching was the source of the problem!
[5:58:43] <mostundesired> Hit the back, stops the witch right away.
[5:58:45] <KingKZ> Dude that jumpscare had me in tears. Absolutely perfect.
[5:58:49] <$Agami23> now thats what I call a strange magic.

[5:58:56] <Personified134> If you can't hit the back your woman will curse you
[5:58:58] <DatAsuna> let him pee!
[5:59:04] <krymzen5> the pee was blinding him
[5:59:07] <Personified134> you have to be big enough to hit the back to have a happy relationship
[5:59:07] <VestigeOuroboros> I hope he pees on the floor and forgets it's there
[5:59:09] <Decsevm> does this inspire @PeachSaliva to do a new verse to the castle super beast theme song?
[5:59:12] <MasterDecoder> @Personified134 Nice
[5:59:15] <+JM_FUNK> PAT GONNA GO DO THE COCAINE

[6:00:22] <VestigeOuroboros> I've paid $60 for worse
[6:00:23] <Dao_Puppy> Well he'd have to pay you for the likeness, so...
[6:00:29] <%QueequegTheater> @PeachSaliva Hey I was in the bathroom for a while did I miss my donation
[6:00:31] <VritraReiRei> Also, it would be nice if monsters would pause when you are reading stuff so they don't attack you during dialogue
[6:00:32] <kekuha> MASS EFFECT
[6:00:36] <BeefyQueefer> play Dragon's Dogma now
[6:00:36] <$Bane_Kaikyo> Fullscreen and read donos?
[6:00:38] <DatAsuna> Finish the donations if not DS2 :<
[6:00:41] <MasterDecoder> DS2! DS2! DS2!
[6:00:42] <+fingalights> One cent
[6:00:45] <Ultra_Pancake> patch in Elmo
[6:00:45] <%depressed_skeleton> @PeachSaliva So this was based on a true story, right?
[6:00:46] <%QueequegTheater> *Sub message, not donation
[6:00:47] <+Tokanova> they'd work something out
[6:00:47] <$Agami23> the people who made lisa didnt pay pat or matt for the likeness
[6:00:47] <SquiglyBattleOpera> HONK THE ELMO
[6:00:48] <$Bane_Kaikyo> love <3
[6:00:48] <%Breakfast_Megapowers> No Donos
[6:00:50] <Aquaczaz> originally I was hoping for some DS2 but that was awesome
[6:00:55] <+Tokanova> like they could make it... a thing
[6:00:56] <%Breakfast_Megapowers> No one donoted
[6:00:57] <DavidSanChan> the peeboard
[6:00:58] <Habblewater> That was really enjoyable, great job all, mostly Elmo
[6:00:59] <+Jekado> so elmo then
[6:01:01] <%depressed_skeleton> PaaaAat
[6:01:03] <%ShockzNDrawe> @PeachSaliva hows your foot feeling btw?
[6:01:03] <+Jekado> ELMOS
[6:01:14] <Sokumotanaka> The mystery of castle super beast was the friends we made along the eay
[6:01:17] <DatAsuna> Donos sounds more like McDs than donations
[6:01:17] <%QueequegTheater> Remerai should send this to Capcom and get a job working on RE
[6:01:19] <TheArrow_> my favorite part was when woolie shot pat
[6:01:22] <$Agami23> @PeachSaliva sorry for mentioning this a third time, but i made a dumb meme image and sent it to you on twitter but it was during the bad times so you might have missed it. do you want me to resend it?

[6:01:25] <+JM_FUNK> PAT IS TAKING AWHILE, ARE YOU SURE HE ISNT DOING COCAINE?
[6:01:26] <Aquaczaz> is Elmo going to stare into our souls again?

[6:03:20] <$Jack_of_No_Trades> elmo must be putting fuzz in the line
[6:03:21] <KingKZ> It's constant
[6:03:23] <YamadaZero> Probably a loose cable.
[6:03:24] <TheChillRoom> Static sounds like your mics physical connection to its cables is slightly disrupted
[6:03:25] <thehashslingingslashers> you bumped a thing an broke it
[6:03:27] <%GabeSweetMan> There's static with no talking

[6:11:58] <MavMarsh> ???
[6:12:01] <$Agami23> @PeachSaliva does it help to look at pat when not eating?
[6:12:03] <%ShineTheDiamond> @PeachSaliva I suggest taping your busted toe to the one next to it. It'll stabilize it so you won't damage it further if it is broken or fractured.
[6:12:03] <MainMan_Jonadiah> Elmo is sitting DIRECTLY on the mouse

[6:16:14] <%Divryne> ELMO IS A FLATTY.
[6:16:18] <%ShineTheDiamond> <3
[6:16:20] <Ion_Laser> Mouse needs a flat surface
[6:16:21] <%TheMattman1313> *flat with minor imperfections
[6:16:21] <$SparkAfterDark> It's not the color, it's the texture. That's how I justify it too.

[6:17:53] <VestigeOuroboros> Haven't seen one of those shirts since like 1993.
[6:17:54] <MainMan_Jonadiah> Drugs. Are. Really. Exciting
[6:17:55] <%zamatermort> Drugs Are Really Excellent
[6:17:57] <DavidSanChan> mine never had a cartoon lion on it
[6:17:59] <NeroInfinite> Accurate
[6:18:01] <Zaphire_Saucypants> There was a crime dog too
[6:18:01] <+fingalights> They go to schools showing you drugs
[6:18:04] <Habblewater> And it fuckin' failed spectacularly
[6:18:06] <MainMan_Jonadiah> @zamatermort Bro, we're on the same wavelength
[6:18:07] <$SparkAfterDark> Dare was basically to let kids know how to be cool
[6:18:09] <Tarviti> It wasn't even cops, its 100% just a big make money business
[6:18:10] <MakeshiftSurgeon> You mean it doesn't mean Drugs Are Really Exciting? Kappa
[6:18:10] <%supercasualboom> DARE. To keep cops off donuts.
[6:18:10] <MavMarsh> my classmates would always walk out of it thinking
[6:18:12] <$Jack_of_No_Trades> I dare you NOT to
[6:18:14] <MavMarsh> man drugs are so cool
[6:18:14] <Sphincter_Spelunker> Yeah, alot of people thought that at my school
[6:18:18] <%SoFarFetched> yes
[6:18:18] <+fingalights> Dare you not to do drugs
[6:18:19] <KeiPrime> i remember dare
[6:18:19] <%QueequegTheater> It was fucking dumb
[6:18:20] <VestigeOuroboros> All it ever did was make kids do more drugs
[6:18:20] <Pompadourius> I know the thing.
[6:18:21] <Zaphire_Saucypants> yeah
[6:18:24] <$NitronStreams> "dare to yo say mo to drugs"
[6:18:24] <%Divryne> HELL YEAH.
[6:18:25] <Trash_leviathan> i try to forget
[6:18:25] <%ShineTheDiamond> Yes
[6:18:27] <Ion_Laser> yes
[6:18:28] <+merylinspants> yes, i still have my dare shirt too
[6:18:28] <MasterDecoder> We do, Pat doesn't
[6:18:28] <%GabeSweetMan> They ended that program cuz it SUCKED.
[6:18:31] <%Divryne> I dare you to smoke all that crack kid.
[6:18:31] <MattoBii> god I remember watching an animated DARE tape at school
[6:18:33] <Habblewater> They used to pass out weed to look at and would mysteriously not get it back
[6:18:33] <Frostydough1> Can confirm, went to a Chicago suburb school, DARE was forced contracts
[6:18:38] <Valdorick> To be fair, Pat, cops dareing people to do drugs is how drug stings work! @PeachSaliva
[6:18:38] <Kazic5000> Yeah, I went to dare. Wore a beer shirt to the graduation ceremony.
[6:18:40] <Ion_Laser> My elementary school loved the DARE program
[6:18:41] <%chvmpchange> Paige Im from illinois DARE was a yearly thing
[6:18:44] <sentientvin> they still do it just under diffenet names
[6:18:45] <Panquake25> it is and was!
[6:18:45] <King_Wolf_Rigger> Drugs Are Really Exceptional.
[6:18:46] <%SoFarFetched> People were just more like "Where are these free drugs people keep telling us about??"
[6:18:49] <CatmanIX> i legit got kicked out of DARE in 5th grade
[6:18:50] <+Forente> all my stoner friends wore the shirts out of spite
[6:18:52] <based_versauen> First thing I did with my DARE shirt was smoke weed wearing it
[6:18:55] <MasterDecoder> Pat, it was the 90s!
[6:18:56] <DavidSanChan> We had a police guy show us the weeds
[6:18:57] <%QueequegTheater> @PeachSaliva Yeah, what you're saying is LITERALLY WHAT HAPPENED
[6:19:00] <+JohnMarkley> when I was a kid my class started referring to it as "Drug Abuse Recreational Enterprises"
[6:19:07] <jaid251> The big weed will give you the aid
[6:19:07] <$Jack_of_No_Trades> heroin is stored in the balls
[6:19:07] <Habblewater> AND THE PENCILS THAT SAID DO DRUGS WHEN YOU SHARPEN THEM
[6:19:10] <%ShineTheDiamond> Right into the ballsack
[6:19:14] <$SparkAfterDark> Dare was cops showing you a picture of a really cool looking person and then saying "if you smoke a weed you'll end up like this badass"
[6:19:15] <$NitronStreams> my dare things were 99% about cigarettes than anything else
[6:19:18] <Rain_Mage> Inject the weed into your car
[6:19:26] <heartlesshealer> crack is whack
[6:19:27] <NeroInfinite> The DARE lion did nothing
[6:19:31] <Sphincter_Spelunker> The weirdest thing an anti drug spokesman said at my school was "Now, I'm not against drugs."
[6:19:39] <%Breakfast_Megapowers> LED
[6:19:39] <NeroInfinite> But you know who did something? McGruff the crime dog
[6:19:41] <%sleepy_coffee> That’s the scariest thing I’ve ever heard, who injects shit into their balls???

[6:42:34] <DatAsuna> Another reason I didn't go random paige hunting
[6:42:34] <%SoFarFetched> I might be tied with paige, people wear my glasses and go "GOOD LUCK HOW FUCKING BLIND ARE YOU?"
[6:42:35] <NiktenKing> The guy gave Mass Effect Andromeda a 95

[6:43:49] <NeroInfinite> hey
[6:43:57] <billyup00> sugar free monster
[6:43:58] <DatAsuna> no
[6:44:00] <NeroInfinite> COffee has less caffine than energy drinks
[6:44:00] <%supercasualboom> @sparkafterdark Basically Starbucks
[6:44:01] <KaiserMario> @PeachSaliva Are those glasses new? Can YOU SEE???
[6:44:03] <42nfl19> That seems like a boomer statement

[6:44:14] <Silent_Fyraena> I know :P
[6:44:14] <Sphincter_Spelunker> I didn't have an NES all nintendo buttons confuse me
[6:44:16] <%QueequegTheater> PS controllers are too small for my hands
[6:44:17] <42nfl19> GET WITH THE TIMES OLD MAN, ADAPT OR DIE
[6:44:18] <DatAsuna> N64 controllers were the worst
[6:44:24] <%SoFarFetched> OLD EYES
[6:44:26] <Dhurkst> JFC
[6:44:26] <DatAsuna> That said I do want gamecube joycons
[6:44:26] <%Breakfast_Megapowers> N64 controller is the best controller
[6:44:27] <VestigeOuroboros> You do not guess a perscription
[6:44:29] <VestigeOuroboros> You are a crazy person
[6:44:30] <Silent_Fyraena> Just I keep pressing R1 when it asks for RT, and R2 when it asks for RB
[6:44:32] <N7RickRAGE> @PeachSaliva Where did you get the Get Smoked hat?
[6:44:33] <AdmiralButtloaf> wow i came to check out the VOD and you're still streaming
[6:44:35] <billyup00> the future is now old man
[6:44:36] <%ThePuddingDead> they were dope
[6:44:36] <DatAsuna> i admit the gamecube controller sucked
[6:44:36] <ShimmerFairy> N64 controllers are the best nothing can compare.
[6:44:37] <%ShockzNDrawe> Paige you need to go to the eye doctors
[6:44:43] <Pompadourius> ok boomer
[6:44:46] <VestigeOuroboros> I don't believe you

[6:44:50] <$SparkAfterDark> you cannot guess a prescription. it's literally not a prescription unless it is PRESCRIBED
[6:44:53] <%Breakfast_Megapowers> Playstation controller is just a SNES pad with extra buttons
[6:44:56] <heartlesshealer> n64 controllers were great, Mario Party 1 is what was bad for those controllers
[6:44:57] <Dr_Mooose> N64 controller just feel weird, not bad but weird
[6:45:02] <SGrim> @PeachSaliva stop lying to yourself. It's un-sight-ly Kappa
[6:45:03] <BeefyQueefer> hehehee
[6:45:06] <DracaenaLeaf> Oh no
[6:45:14] <%supercasualboom> The N64 controller a cluster read...like Peach.
[6:45:19] <billyup00> the plastic on the n64 controller was hard on the hands
[6:45:19] <Silent_Fyraena> Okay, time to get food :P
[6:45:19] <DatAsuna> it was halloween then i guess
[6:45:34] <%Breakfast_Megapowers> When will Nintendo make the N65?
[6:45:43] <billyup00> in 2065
[6:45:44] <DatAsuna> wait, after the escape moment?
[6:45:50] <$NitronStreams> x cape
[6:45:51] <$SparkAfterDark> N64 controllers are weird. like why three prongs for only two holes?
[6:45:55] <Sphincter_Spelunker> I don't get hearing PS controllers being too small for hands. I've compared hands to people who told me that in person and I've always had bigger hands
[6:45:57] <MasterDecoder> Do both
