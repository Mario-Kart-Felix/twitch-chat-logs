[1:12:07] <GuelermeDias> Paige how do you feel now that you know you can never run away from your sins
[1:12:08] <17sevens> There's a bunch of really cool extra stuff in this game, but it's kind of unreasonable to see all of it.
[1:12:08] <mercado94> @PeachSaliva Why you didnt do this other run with a little change that doesnt matter!!!?!

[1:12:12] <RubberFistFight> Chara's not evil, she's a fucking trauma victim and all the monsters ignored that because it was too hard for them to deal with.

[1:12:23] <CappuccinoGuil> @PeachSaliva Pat is right. If you choose to go live with Toriel, Frisk turns into Chara for a second. If you choose NOT to live with her, you have a picture of everyone with you and now, if you choose that option, the picture has Xs on them

[1:12:56] <+dodge_and_dust> how dare you not go back through the whole game twice to see papyrus's phone dialogue on every single screen of the game
[1:12:56] <RubberFistFight> The monsters are collectively a bunch of assholes, and all of them, INCLUDING SANS AND PAPYRUS, should have died. Admittedly those two deserve it the second-least and least, respectively, but they're still part of a race of LITERAL MONSTERS.
[1:12:57] <thebehatted> GOWKratos YOU MUST CONQUER THE POOH GAME BOY

[2:14:58] <%StubYourToe> chara is the scapegoat of your choices
[2:15:00] <RubberFistFight> @Arclight2879 - Dudeterus.
[2:15:03] <%breakfastmegapowers> @PeachSaliva StrayCats donation of 5000 bits got lost just fyi
[2:15:08] <Benpower236> Puppers is preggers
[2:15:15] <%babblingcabbage> Chara was the friends we killed along the way
[2:15:17] <+CluelessSniper> No, Chara is always evil. Genocide just wakes them up
[2:15:29] <Flurbleman44> But since you CAN you HAVE TO
[2:15:29] <BigRooster83> it subverts your expectations
[2:15:34] <%StubYourToe> not sure if chara was always evil
[2:15:38] <Benpower236> We were the Chara all along
[2:15:39] <RubberFistFight> Speaking of uteruses - really cool and rare birth defect is called "uterus didelphys". Ot
[2:15:40] <%breakfastmegapowers> kk
[2:15:43] <@Calek> I'd say Chara was always evil
[2:15:43] <alextrebeken> !uptime
[2:15:44] <@Moobot> 2h 15m 52s since bed time stories began.
[2:15:46] <%SvenHolgersson> BREAKS DA DUSTR
[2:15:47] <smargh1015> Chara is always evil, its you the player who chooses to kill
[2:15:49] <HeartOfBuffalo> love that picture of steve buscemi LUL
[2:15:49] <Thirtine> chara is NOT always evil
[2:15:56] <cizal11> of course he was. he killed himself so he could get super strong and go kill a bunch of humans
[2:15:57] <RubberFistFight> It's possible for a woman to be born with 2 uteruses AND 2 fully-formed vaginas.
[2:15:59] <alextrebeken> did they beat undertale
[2:15:59] <@Moobot> We're accepting fanfiction submissions, if you think you have a good one message a mod today!
[2:16:03] <%Mr_y1096> Ace Attorney!
[2:16:05] <%StubYourToe> theres a good video analysis on chara
[2:16:05] <Graxe_> Dragon's Dogma is very light in tone.
[2:16:06] <@thenefftw> I'd say we're getting too deep into fan theories

[2:16:09] <Prevot> A C E A T T O R N E Y
[2:16:10] <Rellim80> Chara is ALWAYS evil.
[2:16:11] <suikudo> still cant believe pat beat it in one try

[2:16:15] <%SeroSedLaeto> Lisa!
[2:16:16] <%TheOnlyStrayCat> I figured, I just wanted to make sure I did not miss it XD
[2:16:18] <megamonmon123> Please do ace attorney!
[2:16:19] <smargh1015> OR VA11HAll A
[2:16:19] <$Agami23> the main sign that chara is the narator all the time and isnt evil is the mirror. thats why it says "its you" but in genocide it says "its me, chara"
[2:16:24] <+wal__rus> celeste would be neat
[2:16:25] <gryffinp> "Chara was always evil"/"Chara only becomes evil because of genocide" is perhaps the only ambiguous thing in undertale that matters at all.
[2:16:25] <Estuko> try Paper Mario ? <3

[2:33:47] <%GohanEgret> twins
[2:33:51] <Bouldus> yes paige is on medication guys
[2:33:51] <RubberFistFight> @JohnyG - apparently the medical community thinks that lupus might be because of arse-microbes being in the wrong spot, like the lympatic system.
[2:33:52] <fireking900> @mercado94 yes
[2:33:52] <+TournamentArc> I can jerk off to that fact
