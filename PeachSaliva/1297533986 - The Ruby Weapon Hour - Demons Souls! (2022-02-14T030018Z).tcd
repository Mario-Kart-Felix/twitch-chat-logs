[0:49:32] <YakumoYomi> Graphix, Paige
[0:49:38] <OvaltineDream> She beat Ebrietas in 90 seconds
[0:49:39] <%KeiganOfAstora> To play a game again liek you never played it is what ALL GAMERS wish for
[0:49:39] <tanarath> fuckoffah
[0:49:42] <%RayReborne> Lol
[0:49:43] <+Mr_Pylon> Paige could play Outer Wilds forever
[0:49:45] <oda_flobunaga> fuck off uhhhh

[0:49:53] <+SenorCounter> Pat would keep replaying the DS series.
[0:49:54] <+ALazo> what a blessing
[0:49:58] <%KeiganOfAstora> @PeachSaliva Seriously, check out The Outer Wilds
[0:50:01] <Cherokia666> She's basically a living Adam Sandler movie
[0:50:02] <tanarath> Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind.
[0:50:05] <oda_flobunaga> I hate that i have the same god damn dialect
[0:50:08] <%ElkRiverDog> And she still does better than you
[0:50:12] <+TopTieramisu> your other eyes
[0:50:14] <greatspaceadventure> Mother 3 is a first-time-only kind of experience too
[0:50:24] <%RayReborne> eventually............ Kappa
[0:50:34] <%KeiganOfAstora> You can get a bow at this point
[0:50:38] <BigFingerRo> "WOW THIS GAME IS SO COOL WHY HAVEN'T I PLAYED IT BEFORE"- Peach replaying undertale
[0:50:49] <DXLelouch24> @PeachSaliva so that means i have a superior version of what you have Paige, only its selective and mainly forget a game if ive never played it.Worked perfectly for the Bloodborne LP.
[0:50:59] <%g0atmeal> don't forget reggie's beloved firebombs
[0:51:02] <%RayReborne> WOW Burn
[0:51:04] <%KeiganOfAstora> I mean it's in the early area of 4-1 so if you check out the start of each world you may come across it
[0:51:05] <Dova573> I wonder if we can be a magic bow man in elden ring
[0:51:12] <CurrySauseBandit> Wait i'm weird for rocking a bow when I started?
[0:51:24] <%Dakuu75> @Dova573 probably

[0:51:38] <OvaltineDream> ...if what
[0:51:39] <tigerfang86> nice SEA OF FLAMES
[0:51:39] <%KeiganOfAstora> I use a bow in every Souls game because singling out enemies is a great tactic. Fuck off I'm not cheating, fight me
[0:51:50] <YakumoYomi> It's a humanitarian thing
[0:51:51] <Sunstalker> That's hurty dirt down there.
[0:51:52] <StormSamurai8> LUL

[0:52:26] <+ReallyBigRocks> bang bang
[0:52:38] <+TopTieramisu> man, this game looks nice
[0:52:39] <%KeiganOfAstora> @DXLelouch24 Then I'll go in close with a sword. I use a bow when I need to but can adjust
[0:52:54] <tigerfang86> spellsword is always sick
[0:52:59] <%Agami23> im gonna do a bow only run
[0:52:59] <CurrySauseBandit> Do bows still feel like trash in elden Ring?
[0:53:02] <%RayReborne> Check out Protonjon or Chuggaconroys Channels for a video describing the event and Direct Relief. they do it every year since 2018
[0:53:02] <CraigButNotReally> I just preorder Elden Ring. Inb4 they Cyberpunk me. Sadge

[0:53:08] <Treasure_Vault> Spellhammer or Faithhammer. Both good.
[0:53:09] <$chance_h> God, I never used magic in DS2 and 3. Seeing regenerative mana is crazy strong

[0:53:30] <%legendfather_of_giants> @PeachSaliva magic was so busted here they changed it forever, and then still had to nerf it again
[0:53:36] <YakumoYomi> I sincerely hope Elden Ring has a way to recover MP outside of consumables. Even something like the Handmaid Dagger from DS3 (which let you recover FP on hit)
[0:53:38] <stormhawk9891> 'Cept for that one part
[0:53:44] <bluepsych1h> Naked class with club always

[0:54:43] <+Deekman> I heard the people that got to play the final build of Elden Ring last week had to connect to Fromsoft servers through parsec and just deal with the input lag
[0:54:46] <%g0atmeal> ask him if a kilogram of feathers or steel is heavier
[0:54:57] <+GinAndRoses> lmao

[0:55:24] <Latija> Pat why are you acting like Paige has played these games before?

[1:05:23] <%RayReborne> @my2k_ for what? the Gollum game???
[1:05:30] <CatRidder> INT is how many spell you can use
[1:05:33] <+QuietAlchemist> Put it all into luck Kappa
[1:05:34] <%Pandora_Prime> Just pump Vit
[1:05:34] <SunsetJack> Vit = HP, Int = Spell Slots, Endurance = Stamina, Magic = Damage
[1:05:34] <$cooldude69xx> @holydeviant1 Fans like that are how we get Kanye running for president. Or Trump. Or Reagan
[1:05:35] <%g0atmeal> no matter what you do it will be useful
[1:05:38] <ahmz1404> vitality vitality vitalityy

[1:06:01] <+projectmanatees> woopsKek
[1:06:02] <+SenorCounter> Like Navi
[1:06:03] <+Taisuru> LUL
[1:06:04] <%RayReborne> Kappa
[1:06:05] <+Etherealizer> also lets be real you probably dont need more spell slots to panic cycle through in combat lol
[1:06:11] <%cade_calrayn> she tells you, it's up to you to listen, Pat
[1:06:17] <Sunstalker> More health is good, you WILL get hit.
[1:06:19] <Belakitu> Insert Who Wants to be a Millionaire stress music
[1:06:19] <TurtlesAndTentacles> we can't hear Pat fully. only in spots. that makes it funnier
[1:06:20] <28moogles> 3 levels in Vit, 3 in Magic imo
[1:06:24] <%ForneusAtSeaWorld> hey, pat-uh
[1:06:24] <%g0atmeal> yeah you have really low HP
[1:06:27] <%robotoken> we are always on hold on this stream Paige
[1:06:34] <signofzeta> vitality is good, yeah
[1:06:35] <worldbrand> I'm clenching for my life
[1:06:38] <CunnymobileBrakeFluid> lettuce-y
[1:06:39] <oda_flobunaga> Patwatch would just be Whussywatch
[1:06:45] <%RayReborne> that RTX is strong
[1:06:45] <ahmz1404> all in vit, can't do damage if you're dead
[1:06:49] <+Etherealizer> cant go wrong with vit/end tbh
[1:06:49] <Valentinius_Anodyne> More HP means less dying
[1:06:53] <Coystick> HP and whatever manages mana bar I forget
[1:06:54] <%cade_calrayn> the Emlo hath arisen!?
[1:06:55] <%maskofmichael> Yes you have low HP Paige, what about in the game?
[1:07:00] <%Pandora_Prime> Pump Vitality creepy49Hmm
[1:07:02] <tanarath> 3p in Vit would boost your hp by ~10-15%
[1:07:06] <Sunstalker> Even if you get a new spell, you can change one out when you need it for a different zone.
[1:07:06] <DXLelouch24> all intelligence, nuke the world as glass canon
[1:07:12] <DXLelouch24> its lore correct too
[1:07:19] <ahmz1404> omg
[1:07:24] <tanarath> No str.
[1:07:26] <28moogles> no....
[1:07:28] <%cade_calrayn> Endurance, Paige
[1:07:28] <ahmz1404> memory deleted
[1:07:28] <Coystick> Nah leave Dex adn STR alone
[1:07:29] <CatRidder> you dont need STR
[1:07:30] <%cade_calrayn> Not strength
[1:07:31] <+Axellogic> no dont str
[1:07:34] <%EyeFarted> NO STR
[1:07:35] <%cade_calrayn> No strength in this game
[1:07:37] <Coystick> Bad for now
[1:07:37] <cloakofashes> No strong.
[1:07:37] <+Etherealizer> you're a magic lady
[1:07:38] <worldbrand> Str was not one of the four
[1:07:38] <%zamatermort> No strength
[1:07:40] <%g0atmeal> there's a good chance str will favor a certain weapon later
[1:07:41] <28moogles> Magic
[1:07:41] <tanarath> Magic is your str
[1:07:42] <%RayReborne> Magic is New Strength
[1:07:43] <%cade_calrayn> Endurance, Magic, and Vitality
[1:07:44] <CatRidder> magic is your damage
[1:07:44] <28moogles> Magic is your damage
[1:07:45] <Sunstalker> You're not using anything that needs strength
[1:07:45] <+Axellogic> magic is damage
[1:07:46] <%robotoken> magic
[1:07:47] <DXLelouch24> magic is the way in Demons Souls
[1:07:48] <CyborgAV> Magic
[1:07:48] <%EyeFarted> 2 VIT 2 END 2 MAG
[1:07:49] <%cade_calrayn> Magic

[1:07:50] <+Mr_Pylon> Vitality Endurance or Magic
[1:07:51] <Coystick> Magic or Endurance
[1:07:52] <Latija> Paige do you want to be a mage or is Pat making you?
[1:07:53] <Sunstalker> Magic is fine or just more health
[1:07:53] <+Deekman> it's all in the hips
[1:07:53] <TurtlesAndTentacles> ENDURANCE
[1:07:56] <%g0atmeal> if you don't want to choose a build now, you can just do HP
[1:07:58] <+kingcroix> pat is a saint
[1:07:59] <%barrakuta371> use gun
[1:08:08] <tigerfang86> WIZARD PAIGE???

[1:08:12] <signofzeta> yeah it's good
[1:08:14] <+Mr_Pylon> Hell yeah!
[1:08:14] <CatRidder> yes
[1:08:14] <Latija> sure
[1:08:14] <%robotoken> who said that? who's talking?
[1:08:15] <%Agami23> the spirit of magic mike said yes
[1:08:16] <tanarath> ye

[1:08:22] <+Etherealizer> 3 vit, 3 end- you already got 15 magic
[1:08:22] <%RayReborne> Saint Patrick of Orb called down from Orbland
[1:08:22] <Mattais88> Don't listen to the ghost. Ghost's lie
[1:08:24] <Truinz25> Does it?
[1:08:25] <Coystick> An angle
[1:08:26] <Broand> a sinner

[1:08:31] <+Ne1son> Ye
[1:08:31] <DXLelouch24> @PeachSaliva just google the best build, Pat will never know
[1:08:33] <%g0atmeal> good if you'll keep using spells
[1:08:35] <$Trenr> all magic, go big or go home
[1:08:36] <%RayReborne> this is fine yee yee
[1:08:36] <CatRidder> put one in endurence so its a 10
[1:08:36] <+Gogogolem> Pat the patron Saint to the blind.
[1:08:37] <%cade_calrayn> bring endurance up a bit?
[1:08:38] <%EyeFarted> 2 vit 2 end 2 mag
[1:08:38] <%RayReborne> csbeastYeyeye csbeastYeyeye
[1:08:38] <%Ranryu692> how many pairs of glasses would an accurate biblical angel need
[1:08:41] <%Pandora_Prime> VIT and MAGIC
[1:08:42] <FunkyStreams> youre a loonie
[1:08:47] <+Mr_Pylon> Go for it!
[1:08:47] <RetroCop87> go for the boring tank class
[1:08:48] <+SoySocks> spells continue to rule
[1:08:49] <%Agami23> your sword does magic damage too
[1:08:51] <%legendfather_of_giants> with enough magic you dont need vit
[1:08:52] <Coystick> Spells is good the whole game
[1:08:54] <+goose_attack_almanac> Remember when those angels descended unto the earth and taught humanity the good word of Vore
[1:08:55] <JetpackMcQuack> Dump into luck, then guess
[1:08:56] <+Deekman> you will keep using spells, it's WAY over powered in DeS
[1:08:58] <%cade_calrayn> eh fuck it go with this
[1:08:59] <Latija> don't you want to hit people with a hammer
[1:09:08] <%Agami23> yes
[1:09:09] <%cade_calrayn> yeah magic is best in this game
[1:09:10] <28moogles> This is good
[1:09:10] <Treasure_Vault> Wait, do saints get to schtoop angels?
[1:09:12] <+Deekman> looks goo
[1:09:13] <%cade_calrayn> you're good Paige!
[1:09:15] <Valentinius_Anodyne> Seems okay
[1:09:15] <$chance_h> Looks great, magic scales your magic sword
[1:09:16] <+Axellogic> pew pew build
[1:09:17] <CatRidder> ITS GUD
[1:09:22] <+notsoy> pretty sure a magic hammer shows up at some point lol
[1:09:22] <%ForneusAtSeaWorld> magic is good for mines and skeletons
[1:09:22] <Coystick> I'd go 4 Vit, 2 in Mag
[1:09:25] <%Agami23> eventually you can make a magic hammer
[1:09:26] <%cade_calrayn> magic makes your sword better, Paige
[1:09:28] <tanarath> Magic is strong too
[1:09:29] <DXLelouch24> Magic is better than physical in Demons Souls
[1:09:29] <%robotoken> oh god
[1:09:30] <JetpackMcQuack> You'll be ok :)
[1:09:31] <+notsoy> endurance and vit will never fail you
[1:09:32] <kinkade_77> ITS GOOD
[1:09:33] <DXLelouch24> FACT
[1:09:41] <Sunstalker> You can always grab a mace for a low stength hammer and upgrade it to do magic dmg.
[1:09:42] <+SveriSageAdvice> 2 would be good
[1:09:44] <%cade_calrayn> Nah, you're good now
[1:09:47] <TurtlesAndTentacles> 3 and 3 is fine
[1:09:48] <%cade_calrayn> 3 vit, 3 Magic
[1:09:49] <tanarath> Nah 3/3 is good
[1:09:49] <Latija> if you level strength you can use different weapons instead of just a sword
[1:09:50] <tigerfang86> Bald cat
[1:09:53] <+Deekman> no you'll need the health to take hits
[1:09:53] <Valentinius_Anodyne> You're going to need Magic and Vitality at some point, so this is good
[1:09:54] <%cade_calrayn> you're fine with what you have right now
[1:09:54] <+g4mejoy> Nah, I like the even numbers its good now
[1:09:56] <tigerfang86> baaaaaaaaaaaaaaald cat
[1:09:57] <signofzeta> awwww, bald tummy elmo
[1:09:59] <%RayReborne> but just for weapons with Magic scaling so dont use non-magic wepons
[1:09:59] <+JayCantDo> hasRight psaPorgmo hasLeft
[1:10:02] <%g0atmeal> even w/o respec, this is the game where it matters the least imo
[1:10:04] <usuallysleepy> str is a moderately difficult build in ds, and the best weapon is easily missable
[1:10:07] <Ferndoodle> put it all on luck
[1:10:14] <DXLelouch24> with the busted magic weapons later on Magic. This Is The Way
[1:10:20] <TurtlesAndTentacles> that RTX is great lol
[1:10:22] <Latija> you're still low level anyway so its not a big deal
[1:10:45] <28moogles> You can't really botch it.
[1:11:02] <+Etherealizer> YEAH
[1:11:03] <Coystick> I hope there's no Respec in Elden Ring, bring back the old careful build planing
[1:11:07] <Sunstalker> Eh, you just level some more then, Paige. You're not looking for pvp
[1:11:07] <tigerfang86> well

[1:28:20] <Cheekynandos689> ?
[1:28:20] <%AncelDeLambert> @PeachSaliva it's about a girl encouraging a guy to break up with his girlfriend
[1:28:27] <+CalderGaming> by whom?
[1:28:32] <SiriusLeeLost> Hell, even the "Do you like Pinacolatos" song is about a man wanting to cheat on his wife
[1:28:32] <SwindlerOfProgress> Robyn

[1:29:30] <+doc_ock_rokc> @Capn_Bilge He knows when your been bad or good so be good for goodness sake
[1:29:31] <+NWR_James> One is SANTA the other is an emotional manipulator!

[1:29:49] <+Mr_Pylon> Someday Santa will have his reckoning
[1:29:52] <hearingthenseeing> pumped up kicks is just about shoes, what are y'all talking about gulp
[1:29:54] <+RLT917> Sting wrote that song after a break up, he was actually being a creep
[1:30:03] <leaplearning> that's just santa
[1:30:04] <%g0atmeal> santa isn't WHAT
[1:30:04] <RetroCop87> that's what makes it HOT
[1:30:04] <@CreepyPorpoise> WHAT
[1:30:07] <Darkred28> D: WHAT
[1:30:07] <@CreepyPorpoise> SANTA ISNT REAL?
[1:30:08] <%mongorific> I thought the song was about your mom cheating on your dad with Santa
[1:30:09] <+cvp5127> i thought it was about cucking
[1:30:09] <hearingthenseeing> pause
[1:30:09] <Capn_Bilge> but what if it was your uncle
[1:30:09] <Sunstalker> One is a crime, the other is a notice of getting cucked. LuL
[1:30:11] <+Ne1son> Not a good Christmas Song
[1:30:13] <JetpackMcQuack> That's a good ass song
[1:30:14] <oda_flobunaga> Speaking of Santa Claus, anyone here read Terry Pratchett's Hogfather?
[1:30:15] <@CreepyPorpoise> creepy49Cry
[1:30:15] <Mrbaconator> SANTA IS MY DAD?
[1:30:17] <TurtlesAndTentacles> What if it wasn't your dad and your mom is a loose woman
[1:30:18] <%ElkRiverDog> Somewhere out there is fanart of Santa listening to Every Move you Make while delivering presents
[1:30:19] <Valentinius_Anodyne> Santa isn't real D:
[1:30:22] <%walternatorz> excuse me?
[1:30:23] <%RayReborne> ............................. i didnt think it was about your DAD dressed as Santa csbeastSetIn
[1:30:24] <MyNameIsRasus> He's gonna get his milk and cookies goddamnit
[1:30:25] <%AncelDeLambert> Pumped Up Kicks is an amazing song about a dweeb who finds his dad's gun and struts around the house with it
[1:30:26] <$RealThiele> mall santa is my dad?
[1:30:28] <$chance_h> MY DAD IS KISSING SANTA CLAUS?

[1:30:33] <stantheman_97> i just assumed it was a song about santa cucking your dad
[1:30:33] <%ForneusAtSeaWorld> like sekiro
[1:30:36] <hearingthenseeing> the CONCEPT is real
[1:30:39] <+ReallyBigRocks> the real santa is the presents we gave along the way
[1:30:41] <Dapper_Cactuar> don't forget we have a popular Christmas song about hit and run vehicular manslaughter
[1:30:41] <%mongorific> Santa cucking your dad
[1:30:46] <morningmoondude> My dad being santa makes sense, that's why he never came back
[1:30:46] <+doc_ock_rokc> @PeachSaliva Maybe the real santa is the friends we made along the way
[1:30:51] <+RedMaskBandit> the Always Sunny bit of Charlie's mom with "santa" is funny
[1:30:53] <JetpackMcQuack> There are great reasons to do that
[1:30:54] <Treasure_Vault> but please tell me why my car is in the front yard and I'm sleeping with my clothes on
[1:31:00] <$Puhff> You're right, emotionally manipulating someone and potentially ruining their life is much better...
[1:31:01] <%g0atmeal> harmlessly shoot them to death
[1:31:08] <%RayReborne> @mongorific as i said above, i legit thought that was what it's about psaLol csbeastSetIn psaLol csbeastSetIn
[1:31:13] <$Chatterbox1991> technichally Santa was real in that Saint Nicholas was probably a real person IE a Greek priest from hundreds of years ago.

[1:38:44] <MyNameIsRasus> Hot Mud sounds like a bad cop show from the 80s
[1:38:48] <+CalderGaming> so buttrock is not so much a genre as it is an invective
[1:38:56] <+CalderGaming> is what i'm getting

[1:39:48] <+FoolsArcade> @razielhex Dragonforce is Butt Metal
[1:39:54] <+Deekman> Stranger Things should've been an anthology as originally intended
[1:39:55] <%RayReborne> Dragonforce is just straight up metal lol
[1:39:56] <+Ynkubus_> @razielhex its power metal, speed metal is judas priest

[1:40:29] <yukichocomilk> anthology is good
[1:40:30] <$Puhff> I am now having trouble thinking of anthologies
