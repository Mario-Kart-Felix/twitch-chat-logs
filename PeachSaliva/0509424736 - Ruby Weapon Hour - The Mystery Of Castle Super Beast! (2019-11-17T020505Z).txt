[0:32:35] <honeyman18> Kim is a brother to me, I would die for him.
[0:32:39] <%stovetopism> But Paige if I don't use my niceness on you I'd have to use it on strangers
[0:32:40] <%supercasualboom> Super Cum Cop
[0:32:42] <%Bearphonics> Peach has been streaming for longer than anyone, but she's only done like 5 of them
[0:32:51] <%lewdskeletor13> Cheer100 Cheer100 Cheer100 Cheer100 more context on the X-Men thing: the X-Men were relaunched by Jonathan Hickman, one of the best comics writers out there. The X-Men find out that in every timeline they get wiped out by humanity, so they put aside all their differences and establish a mutant nation/paradise. Old rivals bury the hatchet and everyone gets a new lease on life. Jean, Scott and Logan have adjoining rooms in the Summer household where they live with Cyclops two kids and his brothers
[0:33:07] <%liger_zero_jager> I serve booze to boomers
[0:33:08] <%Kataguro> @arcaderabbit48 It's been a good-ass year. Lots of stuff coming out of nowhere

[0:34:25] <RubberFistFight> oh my god opening a youtube video in another tab caused the twitch player to error out saying there was a "network problem". Fuck off twitch, fucking forcing people to stay on the page or you'll cut shit off.
[0:34:26] <Sphincter_Spelunker> Eye Doctors
[0:34:26] <%ssjklyco> He's been dead for a year
[0:34:28] <%arcaderabbit48> @Kataguro Last year and this year too. And next year has shit like FF7R!
[0:34:31] <terribleusername> drinking cures all
[0:34:33] <Dhurkst> CONSUMING THE POT
[0:34:51] <%arcaderabbit48> Drink Pot
[0:35:09] <+Nomicro4u> NO FUN ALLOWED
[0:35:10] <%Kataguro> Waiting for Gun
[0:35:13] <mostundesired> Pokemon is FUCKED right now. Like, probably still enjoyable, but HOLY SHIT.
[0:35:16] <DracaenaLeaf> same
[0:35:23] <RubberFistFight> Pat? Shitting on people's fun? That doesn't sound like him Kappa
[0:35:23] <+MisterTylerrr> It's fine, I'm playing it right now.
[0:35:24] <Sphincter_Spelunker> Just wait until Pokemon Gun
[0:35:29] <+Darren716> They dont put out anything else tho
[0:35:31] <RubberFistFight> ok where's my goddamn bit badge gone
[0:35:32] <Zaphire_Saucypants> same
[0:35:36] <+MisterTylerrr> Other than Wild Area's, I find nothing really wrong with it
[0:35:39] <$skizzuto> I want to enjoy it so badly, but the relative drop in quality combined with the jump in price makes it not worth for me
[0:35:40] <%stovetopism> Gonna boot that shit up tomorrow, I'm just happy gamefreak is finally letting me make a apple redhead
[0:35:43] <hairtoday> it's wonky but not evil, no reason to hate beyond saber rattling
[0:35:43] <$joylent_blue> its not what i wanted from a console pokemon game
[0:35:44] <%zamatermort> The wonk is waaaaay overblown by the internet
[0:35:47] <+chiluzza> game freak is probably under constant stress that rivals crunch
[0:35:48] <%kiiiirsten> HOLY SHIT ITS PAIGE
[0:35:52] <+PenmanLupine> considering Mario Odyssey to past Mario games and Breath of the Wild to past Zelda games, it's really disappointing to see Pokemon being par the course
[0:35:52] <peachy996> join the digimon clan Paige
[0:35:52] <$GarbageNirvana> It's fine, it's just more Pokemon
[0:35:54] <DracaenaLeaf> Garbodor
[0:35:55] <%SoFarFetched> HOT G ARBAGE
[0:35:56] <%arcaderabbit48> Shield is honestly the most fun I've had with Pokemon in years. Has problems, but its better than X/Y at least
[0:35:57] <peachy996> Join us sex weirdos
[0:35:58] <%maenos2> Feel bad how I've cooled considerably on the franchise
[0:35:59] <mostundesired> You are what you love.
[0:36:01] <mield916> pat becau
[0:36:02] <@MelBrooksKA> Devs didn't have the time it clearly needed, it's not their fault they didn't get it
[0:36:05] <thelonechris> Hence Pat
[0:36:08] <SomersaultJustice> there's a garbage pokemon
[0:36:08] <$velgaduere> people are just expecting reasonable overhaul improvements to the series now, but are being huge babies about it at the same time
[0:36:09] <MicrotonalMatt> Play Colosseum
[0:36:11] <+XxBTExX> "I love garbage like Pokemon" - Paige 2019
[0:36:12] <%Kataguro> It's not as bad as /vp/ says it is, but Pokemon really needs to stop being annualized. It's like AssCreed all over again
[0:36:14] <%nofestu2> So/// Pat
[0:36:15] <%Keyd00d> I'm not into being lied to
[0:36:17] <Bailey__gaming> @peachsaliva picture Dmed :-)
[0:36:20] <Quigsies> It's aight. Way to easy tho
[0:36:23] <abakkus> do it for the vore pokemon that i just found out about tonight and am very distressed by
[0:36:24] <ShichiNoBushi> BB is You
[0:36:30] <%Kataguro> Our MPREG overlord
[0:36:34] <+Reizie_Etherealm> An enjoyable trash fire game might be ok to play but it would be better to spend time elsewhere, like as an opportunity cost thing
[0:36:36] <%sleepy_coffee> pressured to get the things out sooner is apain
[0:36:38] <Roz_Lynd> well i'd recommend you a game that's garbage but in a way i love; but it's chock-full of riddles so you'd hate life playing it quiettKek
[0:36:47] <RubberFistFight> @Kataguro BuT kEePiNG up WiTh ThE cArTooN aNd MeRcH dOE
[0:36:47] <%Kenzo2000> Mpreg anthem in pokemon is the greatest
[0:36:53] <+Anonymasque> Game looks like Pokemon. People like pokemon.
[0:36:59] <@Calek> it's engaging
[0:37:01] <mayorrev> @PeachSaliva That song Toby made got him banned from a homestuck forum right?
[0:37:01] <StaceMcGate> It's interesting, not fun
[0:37:17] <$velgaduere> the least fun you can have while enjoying a video game
[0:37:18] <%ssjklyco> I'm playing right now and making 0 progress once i hit chapter 3. I can't stop
[0:37:24] <peachy996> Looks like a big budget indie movie but as a game
[0:37:27] <%Kataguro> I know WHY they're doing it, but man, fuck that. It's why it's such a huge media empire, but just make something like Colo but with money
[0:37:28] <Zaphire_Saucypants> and still be playable
[0:37:28] <Zalthia> Like Pathologic?
[0:37:32] <BaronVonMagpie> game fun for some
[0:37:33] <Sphincter_Spelunker> "I don't wanna have fun. I wanna play Dark Souls"
[0:37:33] <peachy996> It's weird but I like how weird it is
[0:37:35] <T_Sasquatch> Hell no
[0:37:35] <%arcaderabbit48> Its enjoyable, but not actually fun?
[0:37:37] <honeyman18> it's nice to deliver packages over beautiful landscapes with no enemy to fight... strange
[0:37:38] <RubberFistFight> @mayorrev wait what? Didn't he MAKE homestuck? Or do you mean a different toby?
[0:37:39] <$rdark_ksu> Good not Fun
[0:37:45] <DatAsuna> WHOO
[0:37:45] <Plague_bagel> like darkest dungeon
[0:37:47] <%nofestu2> woo
[0:37:53] <Bailey__gaming> Whoooooo
[0:37:53] <T_Sasquatch> Fun isn't the word to use i guess
[0:37:57] <+cereal_box_conspiracy> You guys have a weird definitino of "fun".
[0:37:58] <$joylent_blue> woo.
[0:38:00] <honeyman18> Fascinating games I guess?
[0:38:01] <%Kataguro> There's a few things that got me giddy. Like THAT scene in the church
[0:38:04] <Dhurkst> "What is fun?" is a rabbit hole we probably don't want to go down
[0:38:06] <+OkamiDude15> enjoyable
[0:38:09] <abakkus> @RubberFistFight toby fox didnt make homstuck, he just did a good bit of music for it
[0:38:11] <+Anonymasque> Intriguing vs Exciting
[0:38:11] <LiquidMathew> the thing i'm really curious about Death Stranding, and its a very cynical thought, but how profitable was it? because Sony might not fund another Hideo if it wasn't, which would be a tragedy
[0:38:12] <$connos_procrastination> Death stranding is fun if you hve the brainworms that makes you enjoy deliveries and likes
[0:38:23] <+RinPeda> Why is calling something engaging also not fun?
[0:38:27] <%Sora20030c> The game doesn't have like, big excitement, but it is very compelling.
[0:38:28] <DatAsuna> "Pee-ach Sall-iver"
[0:38:29] <%supercasualboom> Cheer200 Breaking News: Yes, Yang was alive, but him and the rest of the crew died because Paige left them at the Kingdom and all became skeletons. Just the way she likes it...
[0:38:29] <devanmuse> We've reached a bizarre point where GAMES don't necessarily have to be FUN
[0:38:41] <%ssjklyco> I think twitch ate my sub message.
[0:38:44] <StaceMcGate> If your kink is organization and planning, then Death Stranding is fun
[0:38:45] <+OkamiDude15> paige where are [THE BOOTS] ?
[0:38:47] <%Kenzo2000> Sick bird
[0:38:49] <%Sora20030c> I can't help but enjoy making deliveries
[0:38:49] <$joylent_blue> i aspire to be half as fabulous
[0:38:51] <Dhurkst> Baba is Fasion
[0:38:51] <%Kataguro> It's like we're watching Disco Elysium
[0:38:51] <%starotter70> Your Mista Pants
[0:38:52] <%YourFavoriteShiba> 1 of 3 looks
[0:38:58] <Bailey__gaming> put a bird on it
[0:39:03] <mayorrev> @RubberFistFight nah Toby Fox is undertale guy iirc, he made a song about pregnancy as a joke in a homestuck forum and got banned by some angry mods

[0:39:32] <mield916> paige is an alternate dimension pat and nothing can change my mind.
[0:39:33] <%ssjklyco> Cutting to the meat of the problem.

[0:39:54] <@PlagueOfGripes> one time my foot "found" a toothpick that got driven halfway into my foot
[0:39:56] <%supercasualboom> Put heavy glue on the spliters and pull
[0:39:56] <Roz_Lynd> why does that feel like a ricky bobby moment?

[0:42:12] <LiquidMathew> I legit thought "oh Paige retweeted a cool Undyne cosplayer" when you posted it
[0:42:12] <%a_wizard_in_space> Paige got a fur suit.
[0:42:14] <MyNameIsRasus> I mean, you WERE blue
[0:42:14] <gsoto83> The shadowing of the cheeks make a big difference also BLUE!

[0:43:45] <Neo_Kaiser> It's a joke Paige. Teasing.
[0:43:46] <jerkhov_> All these streams are viewer vs paige

[0:44:20] <$DocMadfox> Cheer200 So just realized you were wearing an Iron Maiden shirt in your Undyne cosplay - which Iron Maiden is the shit so good choice on that front. I love me some Iron Maiden. Also remember for Slaanesh, she has no gender and both genders - so that's a thing.
[0:44:25] <$joylent_blue> thats such a weird first thing to say to someone
[0:44:27] <benjiFG> stamina restored
[0:44:35] <%Kataguro> Yeah, it's not that bad
[0:44:35] <Nina96> its not so bad
[0:44:36] <mostundesired> Just don't use straws
[0:44:42] <%Promessa_EX> the worst part is cleaning your mouth holes
[0:44:42] <Sphincter_Spelunker> Wisdom aren't too bad if they aren't impacted
[0:44:43] <$joylent_blue> its just terrible until your gums clot
[0:44:44] <%stovetopism> the worst part of them being pulled out was the bleeding for 2 days
[0:44:48] <mostundesired> That thing can swell up MORE?
[0:44:50] <+mh9s> when i got mine out they gave me SO MUCH percocet
[0:44:52] <jerkhov_> I forgot to fast for my wisdom teeth pulling
[0:44:53] <$rdark_ksu> mine came out easy and i was high with ice cream, was rad
[0:44:58] <+SWFanatic> MercyWing1 apatWink MercyWing2
[0:45:00] <%Kataguro> Well Paige, you're made of glass and straw
[0:45:01] <tacostarvedbeast> unless u have long ass roots, then its sucks

[0:45:12] <MarylandJutsu> the strongest of glass and straw @Kataguro
[0:45:19] <gsoto83> I only had wisdom teeth on my upper jaw
[0:45:19] <%supercasualboom> Was your dentist a wall?
[0:45:25] <%bettysharkface> Is it a cute story? Cause it sounds like it might be cute
[0:45:29] <+OkamiDude15> they were pat's last words cryMonka
[0:45:29] <%Promessa_EX> i was totally awake by the end of mine, people were worried that i was getting up to fast but i could have drove home tbh
[0:45:35] <+XxBTExX> I'm impressed that the first thing he said wasnt "Hey bitch"
[0:45:35] <%Kataguro> Cram a sock in there
[0:45:40] <ShichiNoBushi> Wear a strap-on underneath?
[0:45:42] <MyNameIsRasus> I have no wisdom teeth cause i'm a dumb bitch
[0:45:45] <+mh9s> oh no its on fire
[0:45:46] <MarylandJutsu> I got my wisdom removed when they surgically broke and reattached my jaws

[0:47:11] <%Kataguro> Sounds good
[0:47:11] <+mh9s> he might know a thing or two about this streaming business
[0:47:11] <+bob_zilla> Slaanesh is the god(ess) of excess. Not that any loyal son of the Emperor would know of such things.

[0:47:26] <+SWFanatic> with elmo?
[0:47:27] <Sphincter_Spelunker> what happened to the gamer cube?
[0:47:32] <%Kataguro> It's iffy lore
[0:47:35] <jerkhov_> Elmo probably schleeping

[0:48:01] <%bettysharkface> It's not about the sucking, it's about enjoying the suck.
[0:48:01] <LiquidMathew> That just makes it more tense which means more fun
[0:48:04] <CurrySauseBandit> This game isn't comptetitve anyway so yeah.
[0:48:05] <%ShineTheDiamond> It's even more fun being horrible, people get cranky

[0:48:30] <tacostarvedbeast> which killer is the cutest?
[0:48:35] <phrickshun> if you don't know what you're doing that means the enemy can't predict you

[0:50:34] <mostundesired> Not forgiven, but okay.
[0:50:35] <abakkus> i think its like the game is one big AU for all outside franchise characters
[0:50:36] <%ShineTheDiamond> @Kataguro Accurate

[0:50:39] <+KevinsLunchbox> does anyone care about stranger things anymore?

[0:51:09] <@Calek> season 2 was kinda alright but season 3 was a banger
[0:51:09] <SovPho> when your arm is on the couch like that it looks like Steve Buscemi is looking over the back resting his head on his arm
[0:51:09] <Zaphire_Saucypants> I like Stranger Things maself
[0:51:09] <Carbonwater> stanger things was set in the 80s, anything could have happened
[0:51:09] <%starotter70> @MarylandJutsu Yes, she will be the monster
[0:51:10] <MarylandJutsu> @LiquidMathew 2nd season was a little shaky, 3rd is great
[0:51:10] <$LocDogX86X> who's the beard bro?
[0:51:11] <mostundesired> Eh, the last season was worse imo
[0:51:14] <%arcaderabbit48> I feel like Stranger Things was the biggest thing ever, then it ended and now nobody talks about it ever
[0:51:14] <mield916> most of these characters didn't die
[0:51:17] <Cymen90> It got better because it went to shit
[0:51:17] <%Lion_kun> season 2 was meh, 3 was better than 2 but not as good as 1
[0:51:17] <jerkhov_> I thought season 2 was fine, got a lot of flack though
[0:51:19] <RupanSen> nah, season 3 was the weakest imo
[0:51:19] <Zaphire_Saucypants> really pissed at the 3rd season's ending tho.
[0:51:20] <Dragon_Batman> seasons 2 is fine and 3 is pretty good
[0:51:21] <MarylandJutsu> @starotter70 LUPUS MONSTER
[0:51:21] <$joylent_blue> faithless_zealot what kind of question is that
[0:51:23] <%Kataguro> Weren't you leveling David for shared perks?
[0:51:24] <mayorrev> yea BILL
[0:51:25] <lesbianmimikyu> @faithless_zealot dude c'mon
[0:51:25] <mister2am> Season 3 was trash imo
[0:51:26] <sadolerlaqreet1> @liquidmathew yeah it became more like the pulp fiction genre
[0:51:27] <roundii> S1 is still the best but S3 blew S2 out of the water
[0:51:27] <%a_wizard_in_space> if you don't apologize you're never wrong!
[0:51:29] <Sphincter_Spelunker> chat's going so fast, no one will no I'm me
[0:51:31] <mostundesired> They didn't tho!
[0:51:32] <mister2am> the only dead one is Bill
[0:51:34] <mayorrev> oh bill is absolutely dead
[0:51:35] <knightwingn94> still havent watch season 2 or 3 so your not the only one
[0:51:35] <%nofestu2> Ash never died
[0:51:35] <jerkhov_> All the characters are really unlikable in stranger things now
[0:51:35] <%Lion_kun> should have been an anthology series, story was clearly done after 1 season
[0:51:36] <AGood_Noodle> Season 3 is overrated
[0:51:37] <%peppertimelady> i dont have netflix right now so i havent seen season 3 yet :((((
[0:51:39] <%TheMilhouseExperience> Season 1 was horror with nastolgia. Every season after that was nostalgia with a taste of horror.
[0:51:41] <%bettysharkface> They kinda forget about Will's character development and it makes me sad.
[0:51:41] <jerkhov_> F
[0:51:42] <%juxtest> How can Ash be dead or missing if hes gonna be in Mortal Kombat
[0:51:42] <@Calek> Barb is hella dead!
[0:51:44] <honeyman18> Season 3 had cool monsters, but that's the most to me.
[0:51:45] <%rumtumtugnutz> @faithless_zealot Not cool man
[0:51:47] <%Lion_kun> also stranger things has some of the cruelest deaths to characters
[0:51:49] <CurrySauseBandit> It
[0:51:49] <%Kataguro> Ash got portal'd
[0:51:49] <mayorrev> Bill is super dead
[0:51:49] <%Keyd00d> Barb got no justice
[0:51:49] <%arcaderabbit48> So who would win? The Entity or The Beholder?
[0:51:50] <MarylandJutsu> yeeah Ash is still alive
[0:51:50] <faithless_zealot> @lesbianmimikyu Not trying to be a dick, legitimately curious
[0:51:52] <MyNameIsRasus> Barb is cadaverific
[0:51:52] <%YourFavoriteShiba> of course
[0:51:52] <tacostarvedbeast> ash : I lived bitch
[0:51:55] <+Anime_Flux> I mean, even with lore, these two characters don't really have anything in particular you'd need to know for this game
[0:51:57] <%starotter70> He just got old
[0:51:57] <%Lion_kun> to characters who really did not deserve it
[0:51:58] <DedlokPM> Ash never died, but the show ended
[0:51:58] <CurrySauseBandit> It's honestly going to be really hard to top season 1
[0:52:00] <%ssjklyco> No body no death
[0:52:00] <%Kataguro> Bill is super dead
[0:52:02] <jerkhov_> Yeah they should've put Barb then
[0:52:02] <Dr_Mooose> Ash will never die
[0:52:02] <heart_ablaze> everyone liked Barb
[0:52:03] <Zaphire_Saucypants> was not a fan of the romancing between kids.
[0:52:03] <$joylent_blue> faithless_zealot well its a dick question, regardless of intent
[0:52:03] <mield916> nor did Quentin
[0:52:03] <Cymen90> The problem was how GOOD Season 1 was. It was like a really good 80's film but long
[0:52:04] <mister2am> Everyone disappeared except Bill who is dead
[0:52:07] <MasterCosmic> chat go faster to dizzy her
[0:52:09] <mostundesired> IT's like dying, only slower.
[0:52:09] <%YourFavoriteShiba> *Ash lives* ... Groovy
[0:52:12] <DamnGoodCake> got old, the worst way to disappear
[0:52:15] <dagreenpillow> That's trueee thooo
[0:52:16] <Zaphire_Saucypants> shit was creepy.
[0:52:18] <%TheMilhouseExperience> I did not appreciate the never ending story part of season 3.
[0:52:18] <DevilDeus13> Isnt Lori Strode a survivor? In which case not dead either
[0:52:18] <devanmuse> Barb dead as shit
[0:52:18] <Roz_Lynd> in a related story, elvis is NOT dead he just went home
[0:52:19] <dagreenpillow> I want Bar
[0:52:22] <dagreenpillow> Barb*
[0:52:26] <faithless_zealot> @joylent_blue I'm sorry your feelings got hurt
[0:52:30] <$LocDogX86X> Ash should be super OP
[0:52:30] <Carbonwater> nancy is great, steve not so much
[0:52:31] <tacostarvedbeast> meg players, am i right guys?
[0:52:32] <%Lion_kun> RIP Alexei
[0:52:34] <Zaphire_Saucypants> I don't wanna see lil kids smoochin.

[0:52:52] <%snow_bush> Step 1. Be as toxic as possible
[0:52:54] <%bettysharkface> Shivers
[0:52:56] <%Kataguro> Paige, a lot of these perks got rebalanced since you last played. You might want to change up
[0:53:10] <%Keyd00d> Step 1: only look out for yourself
[0:53:16] <Xeno351> why are you starting the game already it hasn't even been 3 hours of podcast yet?
[0:53:18] <mister2am> Spine chill is still pretty good tho
[0:53:20] <%TheMilhouseExperience> It’s like learning to play your favorite game, again.

[0:53:54] <corpsegoo> just watch out for his three miles of reach
[0:53:54] <P00ksta> No, Nurse is still the best
[0:54:01] <+LeonPup> spine chill still works; it's only aura seeing perks don't work against stealth killers during their "power" phase @PeachSaliva
[0:54:01] <Dragon_Batman> Interesting

[0:56:14] <sIipperySeaMen> Hello i am old player returning, why nobody is playing sprint burst?
[0:56:16] <%TamsynRRD> TamsynRRD subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 22 months, currently on a 22 month streak! Hey Paige! After losing our 12 year old calico to cancer, we adopted a rescue kitten. A 3 month old solid black boy that we named Boo. He's a horrible little gremlin and I love him.
[0:56:20] <$LocDogX86X> go for it
[0:56:22] <+KevinsLunchbox> this is a lot of work looking at perks just to play a game and end the stream Kappa
[0:56:23] <%ShineTheDiamond> @PeachSaliva Oh, believe me, I'm being a total hypocrite by telling you not to worry

[1:23:07] <$theman515> I need to know when Big the Cat is going to be in the movie
[1:23:09] <+Th3SmartAlec> But we could have had G.U.N.
[1:23:10] <Zebroneath> Those are the real questions
[1:23:10] <%Kataguro> I think they confirmed none of Sonic's friends are in the movie, which is like why even bother?
[1:23:13] <%arcaderabbit48> Is this the Demogorgon map?
[1:23:13] <%AncelDeLambert> ... wtf kind of RE umbrella shit?
[1:23:14] <+PerrinIsDead> Hey guys you seen that Shadman art of Sonic?

[1:23:26] <%SoFarFetched> This must be the scene from STranger Things.

[1:23:45] <$FrogROOT> 🎺
[1:23:46] <$Bt_Robot> No rouge, but Big the Cat post credits. Turns out he's the bad guy all along
[1:23:48] <%sleepy_coffee> getting some resident evil umbrella base vibes
[1:23:49] <spawnvagrant> maybe they'll tease Knuckles in a post credits scene
[1:23:51] <Zaphire_Saucypants> look at that shitty gen placement.
[1:23:54] <%AncelDeLambert> why in a place ONLY one person can work on?

[1:24:38] <%TheMilhouseExperience> Mistakes keep happening.
[1:24:41] <Dakuu75> paige is too empathic. she's always like "how did my action just effect the other ppl."
[1:24:42] <%Kataguro> This gen is actually really safe if you're not against something with a projectile
[1:24:47] <%juxtest> Blindness indeed

[1:25:06] <%umbypokochan> i wonder if Sonic will turn evil and kill Cyclops
[1:25:12] <$joylent_blue> and we know from paige's portal playthrough that she is the master of portals
[1:25:12] <StonerStan101> Back the interet went bad for a second.

[1:30:42] <Tersalus> WHO LET THE BIRDS IN
[1:30:47] <%SoFarFetched> its been awhile since she last played.

[1:30:51] <Tersalus> (who who who who who)

[1:30:58] <anar_bael> No idea if the map is bad or if its just a really new map to her
[1:31:01] <%AncelDeLambert> LUL hook RIGHT there

[1:31:30] <DesuDesuDokiDoki> hook lord
[1:31:31] <MarylandJutsu> @ShineTheDiamond theres another survivor
[1:31:32] <Tersalus> Apparently birds are the scariest thing your subconscious can come up with
[1:31:33] <%AncelDeLambert> well, she's not alone yet
[1:31:38] <%Kataguro> Free stuff
[1:31:38] <%arcaderabbit48> @DocMadfox He should pick a different animal then, cause birbs are nice
[1:31:43] <anar_bael> either way free tool
[1:31:43] <+GiantsKnife> yeah! she's armed and dangerous now
[1:31:46] <+LeonPup> hatch hasn't spawned yet
[1:31:49] <+Anime_Flux> She might as well be, these teammates are useless
[1:31:50] <corpsegoo> hatch doesn't appear until 3 gens done or 3 survivors dead
[1:31:50] <+LeonPup> you have to do one more gen
[1:31:55] <%AncelDeLambert> listen to the muuuuuuusic

[1:32:24] <Tersalus> @milhousego a whole bucket??

[1:32:46] <%arcaderabbit48> The ability to jump over certain parts of the railing is a neat idea at least, but one that the map doesnt seem to use effectively
[1:32:47] <+lucidrush> Time to narnia?
[1:32:50] <$Corporate_Redeemer> @milhousego Yeah I heard about that. Sounds like a really shitty case.
[1:32:52] <$milhousego> HE SAVED IT FOR OVER A MONTH
[1:32:52] <Neo_Kaiser> Paige would think someone can't see her through the grate.
[1:32:56] <+Estuko> @milhousego Bull crap.

[1:33:01] <bigstupidjellyfish1337> crows underground? fake
[1:33:02] <$rdark_ksu> she seems to be repeatedly exiting the locker, bold strategy
[1:33:03] <%TheMilhouseExperience> It’s so bad the killer would never suspect
[1:33:05] <poohtrailsnailcooch> I wish you could put yoursle fon a hook in this game
[1:33:07] <$skizzuto> 1 more gen, then the hatch

[1:35:21] <Zaphire_Saucypants> sooo...wouldn't logic dictate that the hatch spawns on either the ground floor or basement? Or does this game not follow logic?

[1:36:01] <%arcaderabbit48> @Zaphire_Saucypants The game is run by an eldritch spider god. So it could probably be anywhere. Just like the spiders in your house.

[1:36:41] <LeftOverPizza13> man with machete
[1:36:41] <%AncelDeLambert> going DOWN STAIRS
[1:36:42] <+Th3SmartAlec> I can't believe Paige is dead
[1:36:43] <DatHatBoy> he's just taking you on a tour~
[1:36:44] <$Corporate_Redeemer> Quick! Suck his dick!
[1:36:44] <YeetOfTheMoment> it could've worked. STRANGER THINGS have happened Kappa
[1:36:45] <FaultyBreaker> Surely he can't see you if you stare at the wall.
[1:36:48] <Tersalus> She ran out of hiding powers during the last game
[1:36:51] <%Kataguro> Give me Xenomorph and Candyman
[1:36:58] <$FrogROOT> gj
[1:36:59] <$Agami23> didnt they just release a weird trailer??
[1:37:01] <AltTab> next killer pac-man
[1:37:01] <$Corporate_Redeemer> Paige, the next killer is actually the Spirit's dad
[1:37:01] <%ShineTheDiamond> Next killer is a samurai (I think)
[1:37:01] <DesuDesuDokiDoki> killy boi win
[1:37:02] <Tersalus> Crab'd
[1:37:03] <%maskofmichael> You did a good die
[1:37:05] <%TheMilhouseExperience> Leprechaun
[1:37:05] <$FrogROOT> clip that chat
[1:37:10] <%AncelDeLambert> this is a xeno level?
[1:37:10] <%Ell1ot> i kinda want Chucky to be a killer. I wanna see him hook someone
[1:37:16] <Guardiansaiyan> !uptime
[1:37:17] <+griffball13> a scary teacher would be cool
[1:37:19] <$shurtal> Blair witch would just be a jpeg of the zoomed in face of that actor witht he snot running out of their nose in the move
[1:37:21] <%AncelDeLambert> @PeachSaliva what killer is this level for?
[1:37:22] <$Corporate_Redeemer> Next killer is Spirit's dad as a Oni
[1:37:26] <%Kataguro> Chucky would be ass for visibility
[1:37:31] <Tersalus> Ooh Candyman could be cool
[1:37:35] <+Estuko> I'd REALLY like a Xenomorph, they're so scary.
[1:37:37] <%AncelDeLambert> who?
[1:37:39] <Tersalus> BEES
[1:37:43] <%starotter70> @Ell1ot For a sec, I saw Chunky, like from DK 64
[1:37:44] <$joylent_blue> Chucky would be the Yoda problem all over again
[1:37:45] <DedlokPM> @AncelDeLambert It's Hawkins Labs from Stranger Things
[1:37:46] <DatHatBoy> funny how there is no pennywise yet
[1:37:46] <+VidyaFranX> Such low ranks
[1:37:47] <MarylandJutsu> @AncelDeLambert Stranger Things
[1:37:48] <+th3madness> Paige out here ruining Pat's W/L
[1:37:49] <Neo_Kaiser> The next killer is Anxiety.
[1:37:49] <%g0atmeal> Chucky but human sized
[1:37:53] <%sleepy_coffee> too bad it couldn't be The Thing
[1:37:55] <%AncelDeLambert> oh god that doesn't help me
[1:37:55] <anar_bael> Candy man killer?
[1:37:56] <FaultyBreaker> Needs more Pumpkinhead.
[1:37:57] <mostundesired> Fuck it, just have Cthulhu
[1:37:58] <%TheMilhouseExperience> Did they get Candyman?
[1:37:58] <MarylandJutsu> @DatHatBoy they have their own original clown killer
[1:38:00] <%Kataguro> Chucky and Bigger Chucky
[1:38:03] <@MelBrooksKA> Isn't the Aliens guy like a giant dick?
[1:38:05] <%TamsynRRD> Guys! Guys! The Thing
[1:38:07] <%AncelDeLambert> Stranger Things has an Umbrella Corp?
[1:38:08] <%a_wizard_in_space> Pumpkinhead would be dope
[1:38:08] <%maskofmichael> The Leprechaun
[1:38:09] <%Kenzo2000> Wow, toxic
[1:38:11] <Tersalus> The Thing is my favorite horror monster, but I think it would make it a whole different game
[1:38:11] <%JJCheeker> what about pumpkin head
[1:38:12] <Dragon_Batman> Nice person atl rain
[1:38:16] <DatHatBoy> true true
[1:38:16] <poohtrailsnailcooch> Jeepers Creepers should be in this!
[1:38:17] <+DrFacilier> what about the evil leprechaun
[1:38:23] <%arcaderabbit48> Who would win in a fight? IT or The Entity?
[1:38:26] <%Chichen> @DrFacilier you mean Pat?
[1:38:26] <$FluffiTamamo> Look at her making Pat look nice
[1:38:26] <+Estuko> @TamsynRRD that'd be such an awful idea. I LOVE it
[1:38:26] <+dylin456> jeepers kreepers
[1:38:28] <$FrogROOT> what about pumpkinhead
[1:38:30] <%Mr_pale> oh, jack frost for Christmas
[1:38:36] <$Corporate_Redeemer> The director of Jeepers Creepers should be the next killer Kappa
[1:38:37] <$joylent_blue> The Thing would just turn into a game of Secret Hitler
[1:38:38] <mayorrev> I love the idea of paige being nice through pat's account so it looks like pat is being nice to people Kappa
[1:38:40] <%Kataguro> RIP Pat's blood points
[1:38:41] <FaultyBreaker> Get the pink!
[1:38:42] <%JJCheeker> the thing
[1:38:44] <%starotter70> @DrFacilier Don't worry, Pat's sleeping right now
[1:38:46] <Neo_Kaiser> The next killer should be the T-Rex from Jurassic Park.
[1:38:47] <%TheMilhouseExperience> What about Jack from the Shining?
[1:38:48] <Ynkubus18> krampus for xmas
[1:38:49] <Tersalus> Why not Krampus? People love that lil' guy
[1:38:51] <%TamsynRRD> The Thing could disguise itself as a survivor like the TF2 Spy
[1:39:04] <+VidyaFranX> You don't need any perks from other survivors?
[1:39:10] <$Corporate_Redeemer> Jason should be a killer Kappa
[1:39:10] <Dr_Mooose> everyone would never help anyone if The Thing was an enemy
[1:39:11] <FaultyBreaker> The Thing would be pretty cool. Able to take form of a surviver.
[1:39:19] <%Ell1ot> they can fix the visibility thing for Chucky. Have Chucky's bride always standing on his shoulders
[1:39:20] <%Kataguro> And they fucked Legion up
[1:39:26] <%a_wizard_in_space> put the monster from Signs in here, Mel Gibson
[1:39:28] <MarylandJutsu> The Pig
[1:39:29] <$Corporate_Redeemer> The Thing would be ass because of SWF and Discord chats
[1:39:33] <DesuDesuDokiDoki> pat?
[1:39:44] <Sphincter_Spelunker> Amanda Hugginkiss
[1:39:46] <+Estuko> @Corporate_Redeemer swf?
[1:39:49] <spadeofaces> they screw up every killer
[1:39:53] <LeftOverPizza13> sneed
[1:39:53] <Neo_Kaiser> The next killer should be Paiges boots.
[1:40:00] <%Kataguro> Plague was cool and launched okay
[1:40:02] <studleydoorite> let's just get Godzilla in here
[1:40:04] <mayorrev> I never played DBD but man that's sad hearing how Legion got messed up apparently. I love the idea of a killer disguised as a survivor
[1:40:08] <MarylandJutsu> Next killer should be Pat's MIND GOBLINS
[1:40:10] <+VidyaFranX> Get new teachables, Paige
[1:40:11] <DedlokPM> @TamsynRRD That is what Legion was thought was going to be like, even the trailer for Legion made it seem like that. Instead they run fast and stab people alot. rooBooli
[1:40:11] <playafoo> Whens the DIO patch tho?
[1:40:13] <%arcaderabbit48> @PeachSaliva Clearly they need to add a skeleton to this game
[1:40:18] <%peppertimelady> i fucking hate amanda, scares the sHit outta me with her roar
[1:40:20] <poohtrailsnailcooch> The Thing would have a mind of its own. You wouldnt even know you were the killer
[1:40:21] <%starotter70> Not from a movie, but the Wendigo from Until Dawn popped into my head
[1:40:23] <$Agami23> wendigo from until dawn would be a cool killer
[1:40:30] <%TamsynRRD> Critters!
[1:40:31] <%Kataguro> Look at that Wendigomind
[1:40:33] <cherrycottontail> just new boot goofin' 🤠
[1:40:35] <%Ell1ot> yeah! i wanna see generic skeleton as the killer
[1:40:39] <%arcaderabbit48> @poohtrailsnailcooch That'd be really cool as like a bonus side mode
[1:40:40] <%nofestu2> no
[1:40:40] <benjiFG> micolash
[1:40:44] <Dragon_Batman> She certainly looks like one
[1:40:47] <Roz_Lynd> isn't the hag basically baba yaga?
[1:40:51] <%Kataguro> She's a bog witch that eats people
[1:40:52] <Tersalus> As a Minnesotan the Wendigo has always terrified me, and still does. Winter woods at night hit different
[1:40:53] <DuoScratch> the hag is a swamp witch
[1:40:59] <%Kenzo2000> The demon wall fromFF series
[1:41:00] <%JJCheeker> Evil Ash
[1:41:00] <goombella> I mean, she was forced to be a cannibal, but she's more voodoo
[1:41:00] <+dylin456> werewolf or frankenstein
[1:41:05] <$Corporate_Redeemer> @estuko SWF = Survive With Friends. You can play online matches with your friends and use Discord to chat. It breaks the idea of a Thing killer because they can easily callout who's who.
[1:41:09] <supersilverblc_bm> hey I'm eat pussy
[1:41:11] <+lucidrush> SWF is survive with friends, communication makes disguising as a survivor incredibly weak
[1:41:12] <%a_wizard_in_space> put Keanu Reeves in here.
[1:41:13] <rcw_official> they should put Kira in the game
[1:41:14] <poohtrailsnailcooch> @arcaderabbit48 Right!
[1:41:17] <$Agami23> nicolas cage from colour out of space as a killer
[1:41:17] <+Tearonex> I personally like the wedigo with the stage skull for a head
[1:41:18] <%TamsynRRD> A red cap would be interesting
[1:41:22] <+GalacticaPhanto> Count Chockula or Frankenboo
[1:41:23] <+Th3SmartAlec> in the game, too
[1:41:24] <+Tearonex> Stag*
[1:41:30] <FaultyBreaker> You are never using those fireworks are you?
[1:41:32] <%Chichen> Keanu Reeves as... A Tumbleweed
[1:41:34] <$joylent_blue> but then people would just be throwing themselves at him
[1:41:36] <+Estuko> @Tersalus LUL mine was strigoi, that fucked me up even till now
[1:41:36] <$joylent_blue> it'd break the game
[1:41:40] <anar_bael> Did the hag ever eat people, if so then maybe wendigo
[1:41:42] <+DrFacilier> Patrick Bateman would be entertaining
[1:41:42] <poohtrailsnailcooch> Sephiroth should be the next killer
[1:41:43] <seycheles> amiloAmazing
[1:41:50] <+Estuko> @Corporate_Redeemer ohhh, then yeah.
[1:41:54] <%juxtest> What if the killer was a big old Yeti
[1:41:54] <Neo_Kaiser> A yaoi fangirl should be the next killer.
[1:41:55] <%ArtemisM822> Yay I made it
[1:42:02] <+Estuko> @DrFacilier that'd be a fun one for sure lol.
[1:42:08] <%ArtemisM822> Just finished a game of dbd myself
[1:42:08] <DamnGoodCake> Do you ever player killer? Or only survivors?
[1:42:11] <SolverCODO> Can't hear music, panicking
[1:42:14] <+Estuko> @Neo_Kaiser she carries the yaoi paddle
[1:42:21] <%Ell1ot> Keanu Reeves as Ted for the survivor?
[1:42:21] <$joylent_blue> DamnGoodCake generally just survivor
[1:42:21] <%JJCheeker> killer space clown
[1:42:22] <$Corporate_Redeemer> I'm surprised that they haven't added a Yandere type of killer
[1:42:25] <%starotter70> Nom Nom Nom
[1:42:27] <anar_bael> paddle of doom
[1:42:35] <%TamsynRRD> The janitor from White Day
[1:42:40] <bigstupidjellyfish1337> i think one patrick boivin should be the next killer
[1:42:41] <+GalacticaPhanto> Yandere. you know since YanDev ain't doing a thing with it
[1:42:42] <%starotter70> It's cool
[1:42:44] <%arcaderabbit48> @Corporate_Redeemer Well, Jason is in the game so technically...
[1:42:49] <%starotter70> It might be something with my internet
[1:42:53] <mostundesired> I know you mean you and Pat, but it sounds like you're using the royal we LUL
[1:42:57] <Sphincter_Spelunker> there's a word count limit to sub messages
[1:43:01] <Tersalus> @Estuko never heard of a strigori before, just looked it up. I'm terrified now, thank you. I love learning about new monsters
[1:43:02] <+Estuko> @GalacticaPhanto bugs me that he's raking in so much from it without doing anything.
[1:43:14] <%starotter70> ooooooh
[1:43:17] <%TamsynRRD> Ooo! Kirie from Fatal Frame 1!

[1:45:05] <%juxtest> Did it straight up block the generators
[1:45:05] <%arcaderabbit48> @TheMilhouseExperience I could see them doing a Headless Horseman kinda thing. Maybe not dullahan specifically, but something like it
[1:45:09] <+VidyaFranX> This is worse than everyone trying to find ruin

[1:47:09] <%TheMilhouseExperience> Your fine. Walk it off ya baby. It’s only a neck wound.
[1:47:11] <%starotter70> Ey, there we go
[1:47:13] <ahling2309> Why?
[1:47:13] <corpsegoo> on the positive side, the plague player probably isn't experrienced enough to take full advantage of all the cleansing
[1:47:13] <+Estuko> monkaS why bad to cleanse against plague
[1:47:21] <%arcaderabbit48> Isnt cleansing a core mechanic for dealing with the Plague? Why si this bad?
[1:47:21] <ahling2309> Why can’t she clean against it tho?
[1:47:23] <anar_bael> now the super soaker can throw up shots that hurt
[1:47:28] <+razielhex> SETTRA LIVES
[1:47:28] <misterbackdown> r e l a x m e n t gaem
[1:47:31] <Tersalus> oh THAT killer
[1:47:38] <%SoFarFetched> she still looks good though
[1:47:39] <+dylin456> oh she is cool looking
[1:47:40] <%Kataguro> Cleansing lets the Plague's projectile do damage
[1:47:41] <Sphincter_Spelunker> dem hips
[1:47:41] <%starotter70> @Sphincter_Spelunker Thanks, for some reason I couldn't see that wordcount
[1:47:42] <+Th3SmartAlec> "I'm okay with this"
[1:47:45] <$NoirePanzer> Kreygasm I LOST
[1:47:48] <bigstupidjellyfish1337> oh she hawt
[1:47:51] <+Xelig> Woah, what monster is that? I've been out of the loop of this game for a while
[1:47:54] <+Estuko> - Everyone: OH I'm into her now.
[1:47:54] <%Ell1ot> plague need souls for his fence
[1:47:55] <%ArtemisM822> Remember to look behind you Paige
[1:47:56] <%Kataguro> It turns vomit into blood vomit
[1:47:56] <Heartless_01> rip
[1:47:56] <+VidyaFranX> Cleansing makes it so that she actually hurts you with her vomit
[1:47:57] <goombella> She gets an ult charge when you cleanse
[1:47:57] <%juxtest> What if the Killer was one of the Tomb Kings and had an army of skeletons
[1:47:59] <$poohtrailsnailcooch> Team mate totally used you as a get away
[1:47:59] <corpsegoo> plague gets a power up available for every single fountain a survivor cleanses in
[1:48:00] <+dante_must_die_exe> what is paige snacking on LUL
[1:48:03] <+neojadan> Not cleansing only works if the entire teams doesn't do it. Someone else already has cleansed so she might as well have too.
[1:48:05] <Sphincter_Spelunker> @starotter70 was usually the case for other people. no problem
[1:48:05] <mostundesired> LUL
[1:48:07] <DedlokPM> @PeachSaliva @Estuko Now the Plague can used the cleansed plague juice to change her barf from a debuff to long range damage for a brief time
[1:48:07] <rcw_official> BRAPPP
[1:48:11] <+mgskomododragon> i'd let her vomit blood. on my weener
[1:48:15] <@commanderclaw> I mean, when I rip ass, I feel like I have a spike in me
[1:48:17] <+PerrinIsDead> Them hook sounds are making me feel funny
[1:48:18] <%starotter70> Bird up
[1:48:19] <Heartless_01> cute dress
[1:48:25] <$Corporate_Redeemer> @estuko Cleansing allows the plague to unlock her second ability, which is a long-range damage ability. If you don't cleanse then she can never get this ability. You'll be Broken for the whole game but she'll have to get close to down you.

[1:49:06] <audrus> youre an idiot? IM an idiot
[1:49:07] <anar_bael> Cleaning is what was intended for survivors to do but it gives the killer a puke that does damage to you if it hits iirc
[1:49:24] <mostundesired> LUL
[1:49:26] <+Estuko> Quick, smack her ass then run for it. itll really show her.
[1:49:33] <corpsegoo> the map wide audio cues give a warning
[1:49:35] <SolverCODO> whoops, slipped and stabbed myself
[1:49:35] <DedlokPM> @PeachSaliva You don't cleanse because the Plague can use the cleansed plague juice from that fountain to change her barf power from being a debuff to long range damage attack for a brief time

[1:50:05] <Sphincter_Spelunker> you know when you bandage a wound and then you accidentally punch it? same
[1:50:09] <energywarning> now stab those girls with your bandages
[1:50:10] <$Corporate_Redeemer> @arcaderabbit48 Yeah but it works in either direction. Plus, she has add-ons built specifically for players who don't heal.
[1:50:18] <$poohtrailsnailcooch> You are the Danger

[1:53:32] <DedlokPM> @PeachSaliva You don't cleanse because the Plague can use the cleansed plague juice from that fountain to change her barf power from being a debuff to long range damage attack for a brief time. So in comparison, not being to heal and spreading the plague is better and doesn't make it easier to down you without being in melee

[1:56:54] <$joylent_blue> QueequegTheater she JUST said it
[1:56:55] <%theshillman> zoomy boomy doomy coomy
[1:57:01] <%Kataguro> Why are Millennials killing the doorbell industry?
[1:57:02] <SirFailsAlott> SOME may call you paige
[1:57:02] <Whitestardan> You can still get banned for saying Learn To Code...
[1:57:03] <%Kenzo2000> Hello businessman, my name is @peachsaliva
[1:57:04] <%QueequegTheater> @joylent_blue LUL
[1:57:08] <@MelBrooksKA> As long as you didn't introduce yourself as Peach Saliva
[1:57:08] <+razielhex> @emoonimoo TERFs can eat shit.
[1:57:11] <+logoth_> do lots of crack
[1:57:11] <RupanSen> become an impostor
[1:57:11] <$Corporate_Redeemer> Boomers deserve reparations for the Boomer slavery
[1:57:11] <%theshillman> get WHAT
[1:57:18] <zedravan> "Peach? is that a stri´pper name?"
[1:57:28] <%starotter70> I already replaced my original
[1:57:31] <Zaphire_Saucypants> lot of writers and other creative types get it.
[1:57:32] <$Agami23> ohhh
[1:57:35] <%emoonimoo> @razielhex Big agree
[1:57:37] <%theshillman> oh that
[1:57:39] <%Kenzo2000> Feeling like acheivements were flukes
[1:57:40] <%ArtemisM822> Most people do in every profession
[1:57:40] <%starotter70> Ahhh
[1:57:42] <$onlypuppet> TBAngel
[1:57:43] <$Corporate_Redeemer> THAT FEELING HAS A NAME?
[1:57:43] <+hkey_local_machine> self-doubt
[1:57:43] <%ssjklyco> You worry someone will find out you don't know what youre doing
[1:57:44] <%Kataguro> When you think everything is dumb luck
[1:57:44] <mostundesired> Wait, that's not how people feel all the time?
[1:57:47] <%TheMilhouseExperience> Appreciate the flowers every once in a while.
[1:57:52] <Roz_Lynd> you feel like your accomplishments, your abilities, achievements, talents, skills, etc, are all bullshit. it's all fake. you're a fraud. it's not real. and you really suck
[1:57:52] <+Dr_DangerPhD> "I don't deserve this success"
[1:57:53] <sadolerlaqreet1> Peach feels like an imposter boomer?
[1:57:56] <$poohtrailsnailcooch> Depression
[1:57:56] <faegbeard> 'how did I get here why are people putting faith in me HELP'
[1:57:57] <%Ell1ot> it feels like failing upwards?
[1:57:59] <$Agami23> i completely understand that.
[1:58:05] <%Kataguro> Falling dickfirst into success
[1:58:07] <DamnGoodCake> "Imposter syndrome can be defined as a collection of feelings of inadequacy that persist despite evident success. 'Imposters' suffer from chronic self-doubt and a sense of intellectual fraudulence that override any feelings of success or external proof of their competence."
[1:58:07] <+WutangchickeN> I have the WORST impostor syndrome :(
[1:58:08] <mostundesired> Hold on, you can NOT feel that way?
[1:58:10] <%ArtemisM822> It’s feel like you are tricking people into thinking you belong
[1:58:13] <+Reizie_Etherealm> Sounds like that thing when I cleared Titania EX but didn't feel good about it
[1:58:13] <%Chichen> Can't have impostor syndrome if I constantly fail!
[1:58:17] <+grim_abel> Everyone has imposter syndrome because everyone is faking it till they make it.
[1:58:23] <@PlagueOfGripes> it's a trick question: all humans do not deserve success
[1:58:26] <corpsegoo> feeling like you're secretly tricking everyone into thinking you're capable is another example
[1:58:28] <+parrotman01> get smoked
[1:58:28] <worldbrand> do i even really have imposter syndrome?
[1:58:28] <Sphincter_Spelunker> guys fake it all the time
[1:58:30] <+Reizie_Etherealm> lol
[1:58:33] <%Chichen> LUL
[1:58:34] <$poohtrailsnailcooch> I feel Feels

[1:58:37] <mostundesired> He's not wrong.
[1:58:37] <%starotter70> LUL
[1:58:37] <$onlypuppet> ‘64 was apparently the last official year of Boomer births

[1:58:41] <mayorrev> thanks eli
[1:58:42] <Ion_Laser> LUL
[1:58:43] <$Corporate_Redeemer> Thanks, Plague
[1:58:43] <%Kataguro> But Toby Fox
[1:58:53] <DamnGoodCake> not sociopaths!
[1:58:53] <%ArtemisM822> It’s okay to feel like that
[1:59:09] <%ArtemisM822> That’s a DBT skill Paige. Good job!
[1:59:15] <$Agami23> nah, especially toby fox.
[1:59:17] <%wydamn> @onlypuppet sounds like boomer propaganda
[1:59:23] <$Corporate_Redeemer> You can always reject the gift
[1:59:35] <%theshillman> imma just apply a .45 caliber thoughts deleter to my head
[1:59:41] <%maskofmichael> Peachsaliva, making people feel better one chat at a time
[1:59:49] <Whitestardan> Because you're not Paige... :D
[1:59:51] <pth88> I hope you and Pat experience some of those good feelings too
[1:59:52] <%ShineTheDiamond> <3
[1:59:54] <IminyourBase> paige you make me feel many things. some of which are positive feelings <3
[1:59:57] <SolverCODO> Paige inspires me to cope better with my mental illness and struggles! She's so positive and animated despite her health issues and such
[1:59:57] <$onlypuppet> My mom was born that year, so I trust her incite
[2:00:02] <$poohtrailsnailcooch> Wow Pat and Paige are a great combination
[2:00:03] <%juxtest> Spew forth gratitude
[2:00:03] <%Kenzo2000> You can kinda just trust that the person is serious when they say nice things
[2:00:07] <+razielhex> Sometimes the hardest thing about instructing at a basic level is getting through a language barrier, which is an expertise barrier; translating down (per se) when one is professionally accustomed to utilizing the language of a skillset.
[2:00:08] <Head_Pixel> @PeachSaliva it's because you're genuine as af
[2:00:09] <+razielhex> A lot of expertise can really be measured in how one is capable in performative grammar of a skillset to be able to adequately utilize reference material.
[2:00:09] <$Agami23> im glad learned that paige learned about "the baby is you"
[2:00:16] <Head_Pixel> <3
[2:00:18] <+razielhex> We're all imposters who don't know what we're doing and making it up as we go along by reading what our betters did before us and replicating it, hoping no one notices.
[2:00:21] <StonerStan101> Got to go fast.
[2:00:39] <%Kataguro> They don't want money
[2:00:40] <%maskofmichael> Got to die fast
[2:00:44] <SolverCODO> @Head_Pixel agreed, she and Pat are icons of being self-actualized
[2:00:58] <$waltzqueen> try etsy
[2:01:01] <worldbrand> god that would take me months to knit
[2:01:04] <%ShineTheDiamond> @PeachSaliva You and Pat are keeping me sane while I fight severe, constant chronic pain. You two are the best! <3
[2:01:24] <+Blargimazombie> Maybe you could commission someone?
[2:01:25] <sadolerlaqreet1> Pat is like Buddha he achieved nirvana
[2:01:32] <goombella> There's a sweater just like this on amazon that says "Merry Swishmas"
[2:01:37] <Dhurkst> That flick was great
[2:01:38] <Dragon_Batman> Cabin in the Woods is great
[2:01:40] <%Ell1ot> what's that movie about?
[2:01:43] <mostundesired> More of a satire than a horror, but it's also my favorite, so...
[2:01:46] <+DukeMoose> RedBullvana
[2:01:47] <$poohtrailsnailcooch> Blew you tits off wow lmao
[2:01:48] <$onlypuppet> Felting sweats is a lot faster

[2:01:53] <Tersalus> Red Death?
[2:01:53] <Head_Pixel> @SolverCODO 100%
[2:01:54] <%emoonimoo> Cabin in the Woods is fucking dope
[2:01:55] <%Chichen> @Ell1ot I'd recommend just watching it. It's kinda easy to spoil.
[2:01:55] <$poohtrailsnailcooch> Yes
[2:01:57] <+Th3SmartAlec> ??
[2:01:59] <IminyourBase> leslie vernon yeah
[2:01:59] <%arcaderabbit48> @Ell1ot Its about horror movies, but is also a horror movie
[2:02:00] <+EmotionalFatGuy> The Mask of Zorro

[2:02:02] <%Kenzo2000> The one with Jim Carrey?
[2:02:04] <+Mekhet09> cabin in the woods was so good till the last 5 minutes of it.
[2:02:07] <%ShineTheDiamond> Yes
[2:02:08] <%Kataguro> That's not a horror movie
[2:02:12] <+PerrinIsDead> Behind the Mask
[2:02:13] <mostundesired> Aren't all of those not actually horror?
[2:02:13] <+vdalson> steakM

[2:02:15] <%TheMilhouseExperience> Mask of phantasm?
[2:02:15] <MetroidSlayerP7> As a knitter, a sweater is quite challenging and expensive. Hard mode.
[2:02:17] <%AmaniIsYourBoss> Oh, it's a Paige!
[2:02:17] <that_guy_from_high_school> Have you seen tucker and dale vs evil?
[2:02:18] <$Piemono> Mask of the Phantasm
[2:02:22] <$poohtrailsnailcooch> Shawn of the dead is my favorite Parody
[2:02:24] <%a_wizard_in_space> Shaun of the Dead is amazing.
[2:02:24] <+PerrinIsDead> Rise of Leslie Vernon
[2:02:30] <%Kataguro> Shawn of the Dead is hilarious
[2:02:33] <+conradical> so is Shaun of the Dead, kinda
[2:02:35] <+razielhex> "Tucker & Dale vs. Evil" is Horror Comedy
[2:02:36] <%emoonimoo> I recently watched Henry: Portrait of a Serial Killer and it was spectacular
[2:02:37] <IminyourBase> what about dale and tucker vs evil?
[2:02:42] <%Kataguro> You got red on you

[2:03:37] <$Agami23> tucker and dale vs evil is the shawn of the dead of evil dead
[2:03:42] <KillerRyno> I didnt like how in mask of leslie vernon they treated horror movies like they actually happened in real life but refer to events of the movie that you wouldnt know from just a real life crime case

[2:24:02] <$joylent_blue> reconfig your shit
[2:24:03] <+axenred> change your configuration!
[2:24:09] <%Kataguro> No Instaheal for Paige
[2:24:14] <$poohtrailsnailcooch> Killer should retire and collect social security
[2:24:15] <weapon000> PAIGE RECONFIG YOUR CONTROLS
[2:24:18] <$poohtrailsnailcooch> edgy
[2:24:29] <$Agami23> hey paige, i made the tiny santa mcdonalds art i sent to you recently on twitter. i have now made like 9 of those santa things. padoru time all the time.

[2:24:36] <+Reizie_Etherealm> Paige didn't you want to reconfig your stuff?
[2:24:43] <SirBrawler18> @PeachSaliva Any tips Survivor tips for a new player?
[2:24:44] <seycheles> manYES
[2:24:49] <$poohtrailsnailcooch> Bloodweb sounds like good sex
[2:25:00] <detritus25> I feel that utility toolbelts aught to be normalized in society.
[2:25:01] <mankeyfigh> PRO
[2:25:01] <%Kenzo2000> @sirbrawler18 play killer instead
[2:25:09] <%snow_bush> Git good
[2:25:11] <weapon000> PAIGE RECONFIG YOUR CONTROLS
[2:25:16] <mankeyfigh> GIT GUD
[2:25:19] <seycheles> unstoppable wall paige
[2:25:20] <%arcaderabbit48> Run a lot, but also maybe hide sometimes?
[2:25:26] <$poohtrailsnailcooch> DODGE
[2:25:32] <$joylent_blue> just hide in lockers all the time :)
[2:25:33] <Lewin_Godwynn> You heard her folks. "I am an undisputed MASTER at this game." She totally said it.
[2:25:39] <%maskofmichael> Try not to die
[2:25:40] <polnarefftheturtle> power of friendship
[2:25:41] <%theMrRoboto> I got dead by daylight from game pass, do i need any of the dlc??
[2:25:42] <+razielhex> unless you have LOUD HAIR then don't help your teammates at all, just run away
[2:25:52] <%Kenzo2000> As a killer main, the worst thing you can do to me is learn your juke timing to throw the killers
[2:25:53] <$joylent_blue> paige has always said she is good at DBD
[2:25:55] <$onlypuppet> True?
[2:25:56] <mankeyfigh> You can run but you can't hide BITCH
[2:25:57] <detritus25> Run. Hide. Run. Get stabbed.???? Profit.
[2:25:58] <Nox_ludicro> Otz and Tru3
[2:25:59] <Smart_ZaK1> If you just google youtube, you'll find it
[2:26:01] <$NoirePanzer> Cry as matchmaking puts you against 15s when you're still 20
[2:26:01] <seycheles> break tackles 24/7
[2:26:03] <energywarning> alternatively, learn to puke
[2:26:04] <+Th3SmartAlec> Football players should learn this
[2:26:07] <%arcaderabbit48> @razielhex I cant tell if you're making a joke, or that's an actual skill in this game
[2:26:11] <MaxtollienTv> Man once you hit rank 14 these q times suck. I can't imagine rank 1
[2:26:15] <$poohtrailsnailcooch> You are not that bad at hiding
[2:26:15] <D3rrtyD4n> thats how it was in friday the 13th
[2:26:17] <CurrySauseBandit> Learn juke, learn when use pallets.
[2:26:17] <$joylent_blue> Otzdarva is such a good dbd streamer
[2:26:19] <Lewin_Godwynn> Have you considered hiding under a pile of coats instead?
[2:26:24] <1947> watch no0b3 videos
[2:26:29] <%ArtemisM822> Looping it probably more important than juking
[2:26:29] <+keyoray> juke, jive. duke, die.
[2:26:38] <$poohtrailsnailcooch> Claudette is your healer
[2:26:39] <LeftOverPizza13> survivors are identical
[2:26:46] <SirBrawler18> Appreciate it
[2:26:50] <%AncelDeLambert> pallet looping is still OBSCENE and will never not be, learn to loop you asshole survivor
[2:26:58] <%theMrRoboto> do i need any dlc tho
[2:27:01] <%Ell1ot> dodge, duck, dip, dive, dodge
[2:27:08] <%Kenzo2000> RECONFIGURE
[2:27:12] <$poohtrailsnailcooch> Just COD
[2:27:18] <%starotter70> Woolie will at least figure it out
[2:27:19] <StonerStan101> @PeachSaliva Aw being super nice to the fans.
[2:27:20] <%AncelDeLambert> god I hate looping, it's so screwy
[2:27:22] <1947> buy the halloween dlc so u can get decisive strike
[2:27:24] <%ArtemisM822> It takes practice
[2:27:25] <%SoFarFetched> probably best wait for a deal
[2:27:35] <$OdysseyKnight> but it's all paid, so really like it
[2:27:36] <+soundcloud_raptor> where emlo?!
[2:27:40] <%AncelDeLambert> grinding for new characters SUCKS

[2:27:55] <Dhurkst> Big papa Emlo
[2:27:56] <%AncelDeLambert> it's awful, in game currency is horribly hard to get and characters are expensive

[2:28:52] <%ArtemisM822> I thought you were reconfiguring things
[2:28:53] <%arcaderabbit48> @PeachSaliva Reconfigure your controls

[2:28:58] <$onlypuppet> Pathfinder
[2:29:05] <mostundesired> You're supposed to be a druid before you fuck the horse!
[2:29:08] <%arcaderabbit48> Isnt a gnome centaur just a pony?
[2:29:16] <ThatOneGuyYouSaw> @Skibopadoo adorable
[2:29:17] <%arcaderabbit48> Like an actual pony, not a Twilight Sparkle
[2:29:39] <redrins> I'd imagine smaller than a pony
[2:29:43] <+keyoray> game noises

[2:30:25] <+logoth_> REmember that time Chibiusa became black
[2:30:25] <ShichiNoBushi> It was a unicorn, as I have heard.
[2:30:26] <%SoFarFetched> SHE WAS A ELEMENTARY GIRL WANTING TO GO FULL ROMANTIC WITH A HORSE
[2:30:27] <+vdalson> WHAT
[2:30:28] <detritus25> Steve's hair can't be controlled.
[2:30:29] <ThatOneGuyYouSaw> @PeachSaliva who is best girl and why is it the Spirit?
[2:30:30] <$Agami23> and it was NOT in its boy form for that.

[2:31:06] <$joylent_blue> oh they were asking about dbd
[2:31:06] <$poohtrailsnailcooch> The nurse is slow and boring
[2:31:09] <Mr_Strut> Remember when Misato tried to bang Shinji?
[2:31:14] <televisedrevolting> I want Huntress to cleave my torso in two with her fucking axe.
[2:31:15] <%Ell1ot> i like the huntress. She's trying to kill you but she sings you a song
[2:31:18] <%AncelDeLambert> I can't land the Nurse's ability
[2:31:23] <1947> spirit and nurse are the strongest killers in dbd
[2:31:23] <%snow_bush> Nurse is wife.
[2:31:25] <%AncelDeLambert> and the cooldown of her ability is HORRENDOUS

[2:34:09] <ThatOneGuyYouSaw> I mean, half of his objectives were in one spot
[2:34:12] <%Kataguro> No Kobe for Paige
[2:34:19] <ThatOneGuyYouSaw> so why wouldn't he stick around?
[2:34:21] <MetroidSlayerP7> Boo the murderer! Boo!
[2:34:21] <StonerStan101> Damn that sucks getting a cancer killer.
[2:34:22] <%2hutown> Thats lame, what a big dork.
[2:34:22] <televisedrevolting> You're party is the shittest and you should feel like shit.
[2:34:23] <mostundesired> GET OFF THE STAGE
[2:34:28] <televisedrevolting> *Your
[2:34:39] <$poohtrailsnailcooch> Steve!!
[2:34:45] <Neo_Kaiser> "You call camping a martial art?"
[2:34:47] <%starotter70> "I don't care about points as long as I win"
[2:34:47] <%Kataguro> Paige, don't go back and forth. It slows you down a lot
[2:34:47] <$poohtrailsnailcooch> He came back for you
[2:34:50] <+Reizie_Etherealm> Great googly moogly it's all going to shit!
[2:34:56] <IncredibleMeh> I'm not sure what he's doing but everyone does seem to hate him for it
[2:35:01] <%ShineTheDiamond> To the killer: "Your playing is bad and you should feel bad"
[2:35:03] <Profbathrobe> This is why I don't do camping
[2:35:08] <SirBrawler18> Your tactics are bad and you should feel bad
[2:35:10] <$joylent_blue> he died so that we may live
[2:35:14] <weapon000> if they camp hooks can't you just work on gens then?
[2:35:15] <$poohtrailsnailcooch> Killer is lame
[2:35:15] <Soulbishop> Cmon disappear like Brendan Fraisers career
[2:35:19] <%SoFarFetched> I think this run is fucked anyway
[2:35:24] <%SoFarFetched> is the problem cause of the ose
[2:35:25] <%ArtemisM822> And teammate killed themselves... rude
[2:35:26] <%SoFarFetched> host*
[2:35:27] <%ThePuddingDead> ThePuddingDead subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 12 months, currently on a 11 month streak! Hey Peach, this was nice coming home to watch and glad to see you're doing much better. Also, thank you for getting back to me over the confusion at that Halloween stream ya'll did. Best wishes from me to you and yours.
[2:35:29] <%Kenzo2000> @incrediblemeh camping the hooked survivors is in poor taste
[2:35:33] <televisedrevolting> Improper etiquette for a killer.
[2:35:51] <audrus> and so we dox them
[2:35:54] <$joylent_blue> after game chat about to get T O X I C
[2:35:56] <%SoFarFetched> Guess no one is a Happy Camper LUL
[2:36:02] <$poohtrailsnailcooch> Im just glad they actually punish for that now
[2:36:04] <$rdark_ksu> campers are rad, vacations all across the US in one of those
[2:36:04] <%YourFavoriteShiba> Camper shows lack of skill
[2:36:09] <+Th3SmartAlec> But is it a legitimate strategy?
[2:36:09] <%arcaderabbit48> It si also explicitly not how you are supposed to play, as doing so does make you lose points
[2:36:10] <%ShineTheDiamond> Exactly
[2:36:14] <%starotter70> @joylent_blue I'm eagerly awaiting it
[2:36:14] <%juxtest> Theres murdering people and then theres just being rude
[2:36:17] <MetroidSlayerP7> Jason hates campers
[2:36:20] <Lenmutt> they nerfed your sweater peach
[2:36:24] <Roz_Lynd> hah
[2:36:27] <SirBrawler18> It is a very loud sweater
[2:36:29] <D3rrtyD4n> lol
[2:36:33] <$skizzuto> swish was too strong
[2:36:33] <$joylent_blue> starotter70 its the highlight of any dbd stream
[2:36:33] <%Kataguro> Nerfed your reaction time too
[2:36:34] <UltimortalMoth> Survivors have SWF and genrushing, Killers have camping and obnoxious add-ons.
[2:36:37] <%starotter70> LUL
[2:36:40] <%ShineTheDiamond> Aren't there new perks that reduce the amount of fog?
[2:36:41] <Lenmutt> sorry

[2:36:57] <StonerStan101> @PeachSaliva Are you and Pat going to wear that sweater during Christmas?
[2:36:57] <televisedrevolting> The Killer is like a party host and the Surviors are their esteemed guests. It's the host's job to show his guests a good time.

[2:38:07] <Lenmutt> this killer was lame and dirty.
[2:38:07] <%ThePuddingDead> CAW CAWW
[2:38:13] <Dragon_Batman> The hatch comes in when all survivors are either dead or have escaped I believe
[2:38:17] <LeftOverPizza13> stay by the door and hope he finds it first
[2:38:20] <%AncelDeLambert> I really don't want this dick to win

[2:39:45] <+vdalson> paige pls
[2:39:45] <ThatOneGuyYouSaw> camping is a viable strategy

[2:40:11] <weapon000> Drag 'em Paige
[2:40:11] <%g0atmeal> Bad design if points conflict with victory
[2:40:12] <$joylent_blue> campers never win in the battle of ideals
[2:40:13] <Lenmutt> the game frowns on camping
[2:40:13] <+Blargimazombie> More of an RV, really
[2:40:15] <Deadmanslegacy> wow she's shit talking people with Pat's profile XD
[2:40:15] <%Ell1ot> that person might be mildly upset at Pat
[2:40:15] <Ion_Laser> He played himself
[2:40:16] <Lewin_Godwynn> "YOU DIDN'T WIN" - First Pat, now Paige.
[2:40:20] <%ThePuddingDead> Peach "If you win, FUCK YOU" Saliva
[2:40:23] <Witchtaker> He 4ked by camping so its pretty viable
[2:40:24] <Habblewater> Patting it up

[2:40:32] <Dr_Mooose> you, as in him did not win
[2:40:33] <mostundesired> Points go down
[2:40:33] <+mattymcfilth> @PeachSaliva that killer was a bitch
[2:40:34] <Sacksquatch> No we're saying that you're saying "You didn't win"
[2:40:37] <%maskofmichael> it's a moral victory
[2:40:37] <audrus> really everyone loses, even chat
[2:40:39] <TyrantSlime> zoning is for cowards
[2:40:40] <UltimortalMoth> "You didn't win"
[2:40:43] <%Bonkasaurusrex> I don't understand this game at all
[2:40:43] <Mr_Strut> Lay off the saltines
[2:40:47] <Paperware> Smells like Johns in here
[2:40:47] <weapon000> drag 'em Paige
[2:40:50] <%a_wizard_in_space> he got the SMALL number!
[2:40:50] <+GraceTBM> Winning in a mutually fun, enjoyable way is more important than a boring, unpleasant victory
[2:40:51] <mikesapartment> Wheres your brother?
[2:40:51] <Lewin_Godwynn> Camping is in poor taste at the very least
[2:40:54] <leinadtonu> so, who won?
[2:40:55] <$poohtrailsnailcooch> He didnt win in my land
[2:40:55] <zaptar13> But the game said he won
[2:40:57] <duneblythe> @scrubquotes
[2:40:59] <StonerStan101> I mean I've be banned from a twitch chat because I told the salty streamer to calm down a bit.
[2:41:01] <$poohtrailsnailcooch> I win all the time in my land
[2:41:03] <+flexin_apex> crazy talk is contagious
[2:41:03] <%Kataguro> Paige's Salty Johns, the New Coke of Pat's Salty Johns
[2:41:05] <UltimortalMoth> boooo paige bad boooo
[2:41:05] <Dr_Mooose> damn
[2:41:05] <%ArtemisM822> He probably didn’t pip so no one won
[2:41:05] <Nina96> if the games has a penalty than thats not a win
[2:41:07] <MojoKingIzakku> do start malding
[2:41:08] <Habblewater> gottem

[2:50:19] <Lewin_Godwynn> Professional cowards are terrifying.
[2:50:21] <%Kataguro> Kind of

[2:58:53] <%JJCheeker> RPGGhosto
[2:59:03] <Dragon_Batman> Hello Krando
[2:59:05] <%mostundesired> 300 IQ strat
[2:59:08] <%SoFarFetched> Paige did so good at juking and jiving the GhostFace Killer in front of his face.
[2:59:08] <$joylent_blue> LUL
[2:59:10] <+Reizie_Etherealm> When he looks at me, and I look at him!
[2:59:11] <TurtleButter> it was for the drama.
[2:59:12] <+SWFanatic> Clever Girl
[2:59:12] <Dr_Mooose> rp horror movie
[2:59:14] <%Ell1ot> i was wondering how Paige was playing a survivor and the killer at the same time
[2:59:14] <+soundcloud_raptor> its ok for elmo to have a little salami
[2:59:15] <LiquidMathew> I mean he did have bad eyesight
[2:59:16] <%starotter70> It's where you put your curse om him
[2:59:16] <ThatOneGuyYouSaw> jumping in front of the killer is an alpha technique
[2:59:17] <%Bonkasaurusrex> I don't think his vision is based on movement, no.
[2:59:17] <nichos7> It was a horror movie moment, you were playing to the genre
[2:59:17] <Nina96> he also stood still
[2:59:18] <ElenaManetta> omg the t-rex should be a killer
[2:59:19] <%maskofmichael> Hey Peach, could you do me a favor and say "Son of a mother, bitch fucker!"
[2:59:19] <Dragon_Batman> Good going
[2:59:21] <%a_wizard_in_space> it was a power play
[2:59:22] <+GraceTBM> maybe his monitor has a REALLY slow refresh rate
[2:59:23] <%ArtemisM822> I mean, you canceled his stalk
[2:59:24] <SulfurousAcid> One more Mom!
[2:59:33] <Nina96> one more?
[2:59:33] <%a_wizard_in_space> you were intimidating them
[2:59:35] <+SWFanatic> you were just following the script
[2:59:37] <%ThePuddingDead> we get any clips from that chat?
[2:59:38] <%SoFarFetched> That's fine,this was a good amount of streaming.
[2:59:41] <$joylent_blue> p o w e r
[2:59:44] <Sacksquatch> Power move
