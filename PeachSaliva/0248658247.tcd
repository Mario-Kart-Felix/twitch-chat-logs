[0:29:11] <mr_gentleman96> the sound track is amazibg on spotify
[0:29:11] <%Kataguro> It's a great game, but it's true
[0:29:13] <+MissMalisin> N U T S
[0:29:13] <+Chimeraelite> facts
[0:29:13] <%ziriken> It was super overrated at the time. it's still a fantastic game
[0:29:14] <%th3madness> I think Pat is correct
[0:29:16] <chumpchomper> can u only get twitch prime with amazon prime?
[0:29:16] <+cvp5127> true
[0:29:17] <AMajorTom> Why not double burgers if you're discarding buns?
[0:29:18] <Bouldus> people were super over the top about it
[0:29:18] <Hawkbone_> The absolute worst for me was I was spoiled on Bioshocks entire plot twist and ending.
[0:29:19] <gyrogogozeppeli> its an awesome game but i wouldnt say its the best
[0:29:20] <Rellim80> He wiggled his TOES. *beat beat beat*
[0:29:21] <+Unlimited_> @KDZen_ <3
[0:29:22] <RafflesiaA> It's a good game but super overrated
[0:29:23] <Laironx3> Going Banana shoes.
[0:29:23] <LiquidMathew> I mean it is super overrated, its still good though
[0:29:23] <hntronium> It's kind of overrated
[0:29:24] <+TsunamiPoro> BECAUSE ITS PERFECT
[0:29:24] <$GohanEgret> goin nutttssssss
[0:29:25] <Prevot> it IS the most overrated game of all time
[0:29:25] <DesuDesuDokiDoki> thats fair
[0:29:26] <kamen_advent> The fanbase for Undertale made me not want to play the game. Still haven't
[0:29:27] <%Kataguro> Pope Approved Undertale
[0:29:28] <viviknight> It blew Tumblr way the fuck up
[0:29:29] <%Remery_> DDLC is overrated
[0:29:29] <Botman_R> God, the GameFAQs battle.
[0:29:30] <+ThatGuyfromMars> the fans ruined undertale, but golly I love it so much
[0:29:31] <CorruptDropbear> It is the most overrated game only because the fanbase is utter trash. T_T
[0:29:33] <mercado94> it was overhype
[0:29:33] <Worldbrand> DDLC's undergoing the same thing, which is why you should shut up about it
[0:29:34] <+Psyco6> Nah,ff7 and Ocarina of time still beat it
[0:29:37] <@Calek> I remember the meltdown when Undertale won "Best Game Ever" on the most significant gaming website... gamefaqs
[0:29:38] <StubYourToe> Its a very charming game
[0:29:38] <FuqBoiSlim> PAT'S TOESIES <3 <3 <3 OwO
[0:29:38] <KoyaMusa> Yeah what is Paige actually eating off those burgers?
[0:29:39] <Garthunox> Its overrated
[0:29:40] <missingangle> It's overrated, but it doesn't deserve to be shit on because of that or the fandom like my friend shits on this game
[0:29:40] <Dragon_Batman> It's super charming.
[0:29:40] <gyrogogozeppeli> im really glad i played it before the fanbase crept up
[0:29:42] <%RonDewing> it was overrated and passed my exspectations
[0:29:43] <CatmanIX> Paige does not partake of buns
[0:29:44] <RyuuAoi> ,WE WANTED MOTHER 3.
[0:29:45] <Dio_TR> is it me or does Paige looks like best logcutter Paul Bonnian
[0:29:45] <%BunkusFreskie> It’s overrated in that “people say it’s the game of the gods but actually it’s just an amazing videogame”
[0:29:47] <%Admiral_PopnFresh> I haven't played Bloodborne (I want to real bad) but Undertale was my favorite game of 2015
[0:29:47] <BenLubar> By the way Pat, Temmie Chang's name is Temmie Chang
[0:29:48] <BioStormX> FF4 is both perfect and the best
[0:29:49] <circular7> pat doesn't like good things
[0:29:50] <serrishtar> the lore is super dark souls in its delivery, you dont really get it all if you dont delve deep
[0:29:50] <RyuuAoi> Still do
[0:29:54] <+TMulharin> It is overrated. I love it, and think it's great, but the hype for the game was INSANE.
[0:29:54] <HayabusaTaichou> UT is a pretty good example of overrated but still great.
[0:29:56] <DonatelloJose> No DDLC puns people.
[0:29:56] <+RedPhenol> FF4 on the PSP is sooooo good
[0:29:57] <%xijiy> MORE MCDONALDS?
[0:29:58] <gyrogogozeppeli> PUNS ARE GREAT
[0:29:58] <Hawkbone_> Anybody who judges a game because of the fanbase is just stupid honestly.
[0:30:00] <+electrokev007> Yeah basically HL3
[0:30:01] <%SuichiTanaka> NOOoooooo. PUNS.
[0:30:01] <%Keyd00d> FF5 is perfect and the best
[0:30:01] <kamen_advent> Those are weird ways to say FFV and FFIX Paige
[0:30:05] <+PipIV> i succeed where pat failed
[0:30:06] <Prism_Wing> I felt nothing about Psycho Mantis, but "Turn off the game console" fucked me up lol.
[0:30:06] <TheLurkiestLurker> FF7 is the best FOH

[0:30:11] <+SailingSaturn> @Remery_ DDLC is basically a taste of something that suberverts expectation, so good for newbies
[0:30:12] <Rellim80> Pat's feet are unerrated.

[1:27:18] <$GohanEgret> nice //
[1:27:19] <LifesNeverHumDrum> this looks like the pink elephant scene
[1:27:31] <+Nefarious_Bear> she's a REAL scientist
[1:27:34] <Sochin_Iitsu> Once again, debateable
[1:27:36] <%ziriken> Shes an actual scientist. nothing ever says otherwise
[1:27:36] <Ropcord> this is about as 'kinda' as it gets LUL
[1:27:37] <FenixSeraph> nah she's legit
[1:27:37] <SovPho> She literally made a robot
[1:27:37] <%th3madness> "legit scientist"
[1:27:40] <NightOwlSam> she knows TOO much
[1:27:41] <+Ryuartyi_> She's the Royal Scientist
[1:27:42] <missingangle> She's a real scientist Paige, chill.
[1:27:43] <LeeOhX> Shes not, she's a reeal scientist
[1:27:43] <%ziriken> She made Mettaton ffs
[1:27:43] <Hawkbone_> Not even back from the dead, she saved them from dying
[1:27:43] <cizal11> that was weirdly suggestive pat
[1:27:44] <+OdysseyKnight> She just hates herself for it
[1:27:44] <circular7> skills
[1:27:44] <%th3madness> JUST INJECT DETERMINATION
[1:27:44] <MainMan_Jonadiah> She makes Mettaton
[1:27:46] <vivecdidnothingwrong> She's smart, just not smart enough
[1:27:46] <jacknerik> She made you a fucking jetpack paige
[1:27:46] <sosuke5> she just fails a lot
[1:27:47] <Pairoschuz> She's an "imposter" because she lies about what she does in her lab
[1:27:48] <Lieutenant_America> She's a genius, just one that wanted glory
[1:27:48] <SovPho> A robot with a sense of artistry and two forms
[1:27:52] <Spydurman> she can do science but very poorly, these are all monstrous failures
[1:27:53] <Mr_tonsu> she made a robot body
[1:27:54] <APsaull> well...how much of her success is her own and not just left overs from Gaster?
[1:27:54] <AlchemiBeast> itchy tasty
[1:27:57] <Willfordbrimly> Wow I wish the whole game had this kind of tone
[1:27:57] <SilentEric> She made a robot that a ghost could inhabit.
[1:27:57] <CybertronPrime> She's an average warrior, but a BRILLIANT Scientist!
[1:27:58] <+fireking900> she made a robot
[1:28:01] <%Freelance7> IT'S A ROBOT
[1:28:02] <+Toynota10> Did Pat tell her about Gaster?
[1:28:04] <PaperCrease> she made mettaton's robot body successfully, at the very least
[1:28:04] <ricksaintriot> They seem like successes rather than failures.
[1:28:06] <buffmurffy> well she wanted to find a awy to open the barrier and she failed, so it may be that she SEES herself as a fraud in that regard
[1:28:09] <ghost_teeth> She's actually a good scientist, she just doesn't BELIEVE she is so she lies
[1:28:09] <+byeblackbird> Didn't she put the ghost in the robot
[1:28:13] <ricksaintriot> They just didn't turn out well.
[1:28:13] <SovPho> Paige, it's a robot that runs on SOULS
[1:28:13] <+dodge_and_dust> Alphy's has both done things that she is and isn't credited for. she didn't make a robot with a soul but she did make a very impressive robot. and the thigns she made here show clear skill
[1:28:15] <Louie_Salmon> I mean, she made a REALLY hot body.
[1:28:15] <kjebka> I mean, "I'll pump them with this stuff because I want it to work" is really bad scientific rigor but she definitely got results
[1:28:17] <Sochin_Iitsu> She built an Evangelion
[1:28:20] <$ToxInjection> Mettaton didn't just decide to go into metal to inhabit it
[1:28:21] <Drag0n92> l o r e
[1:28:21] <Mr_tonsu> the LORE
[1:28:23] <BenLubar> how is paige so bad at the save UI

[1:44:35] <$Doomac> I M P O S S I B L E
[1:44:38] <FenixSeraph> : (
[1:44:41] <megamonmon123> That one wws rooooough
[1:44:44] <+dodge_and_dust> "DIALOGUE can help you play the game
[1:44:45] <Lieutenant_America> Isn't this funny and silly?
[1:44:47] <SubjectX07x> Someone said it, yeah, that fight just made me think of straight Dementia.
[1:44:47] <Ssaik> She didn't notice
[1:44:48] <ghost_teeth> just button mash through all that heart breaking dialog Paige
[1:44:49] <%fangdsniper2nd> @Louie_Salmon Wait all of the items work on Mettaton?
[1:44:50] <+Toblo1> @SubjectX07x It works so well because it can't even attack right
[1:44:53] <alextrebeken> how much longer is in the game
[1:44:53] <$ToxInjection> it does catch you super hard
[1:44:54] <robwob2016> SAVE
[1:44:57] <Lieutenant_America> Oh BOY is it SAD
[1:44:58] <+Toblo1> Compared to all the other.... things
[1:45:00] <SovPho> saVe
[1:45:00] <MonsieurHedge> But nobody came.
[1:45:02] <BenLubar> every single thing the game does is to trick you
[1:45:03] <%Freelance7> "I didn't say that, but this is fucked"
[1:45:03] <yosukecchi> @ErroneousNickname even i didn't notice that ?!
[1:45:04] <ricksaintriot> oh my god, who gives a shit. game sucks.
[1:45:05] <+Samori79> they should have pet the amalgimation
[1:45:07] <+Nefarious_Bear> Make paige do Genocide LUL
[1:45:07] <Louie_Salmon> @erroneousnickname I think it's more that Flowey had seen it before, and decided to emulate it
[1:45:08] <@ckbooks> Those golden flowers huh
[1:45:08] <SilentEric> Remind her of the Comedian's dead wife!
[1:45:09] <+TsunamiPoro> then depressionization
[1:45:10] <%xijiy> How many times is paige going to cry in the genocide run
[1:45:10] <finitedeath> all the runs are sad
[1:45:10] <cizal11> we're pretty close to the end of this area
[1:45:11] <BenLubar> paige saaaaave
[1:45:12] <+BioHunter> more fucked than u think
[1:45:13] <$ImasukyLomae> She's hoing to love genocide!
[1:45:13] <$Doomac> I hope Pat shows Paige the Sans fight afterwards, the music is top tier
[1:45:15] <%Lets_frown> @ricksaintriot k
[1:45:16] <$ToxInjection> @alextrebeken she could finish in like, the next hour or two I think
[1:45:16] <BlacSoul> Ain’t seen shit yet
[1:45:17] <Aydarkzero> i got neutral for my first run but never played through it again
[1:45:17] <%xijiy> Are we going to have a running tally
[1:45:24] <+LogothX> Make sure to do a hard mode run as well.
[1:45:27] <misterspotswood> did she fight the dog one yet?
[1:45:27] <cizal11> @doomac they're apparently doing that also. or pat is anyway
[1:45:29] <+CanonHusbando> you think this is sad try a no mercy run
[1:45:29] <wsintai> @ricksaintriot Then fucking quit watching
[1:45:31] <%Quack_of_Dawn> first run is always neutral
[1:45:31] <bryanmildew> hey i wonder what's with those flowers
[1:45:31] <circular7> genocide is sad for different reasons
[1:45:31] <%Triggerhappy938> Yeah but when is she going to get the GOOD ending?
[1:45:33] <+spacehouse> Genocide run soon?
[1:45:34] <the_phantom_theif> Paige is going to cry a lot in the genocide run.
[1:45:37] <+Nefarious_Bear> They're totally not gonna do a genocide run
[1:45:37] <$Doomac> @cizal11 sick!
[1:45:37] <ManfredA> Paige wouldn't be able to kill Papyrus
[1:45:38] <ricksaintriot> game sucks, so stop having heart attacks when things are suboptimal in the playthrough
[1:45:39] <BenLubar> the final boss fight in the pacifist route has my favorite boss fight intro
[1:45:40] <Dani_el_Dani> @spacehouse hello
[1:45:41] <%xijiy> @misterspotswood Yea she fought the dog one
[1:45:43] <RyuuAoi> Undertale: Disaster Ark
[1:45:44] <SilentEric> @PeachSaliva Remind her of the comedian and his dead wife and his runaway son!
[1:45:44] <%Solid_Seth> You like Tonal shifts, wait till you play Lisa.
[1:45:46] <%Triggerhappy938> Suffer not the monster to live
[1:45:47] <megamonmon123> genocide run is the most depressing run
[1:45:48] <Quibbis> EVERY TIME
[1:45:49] <DesuDesuDokiDoki> ?
[1:45:50] <ghost_teeth> @misterspotswood they used the stick and skipped the whole fight
[1:45:51] <Sochin_Iitsu> unnecessary save!
[1:45:52] <jgardner> @misterspotswood She did, chat screamed stick and she threw stick, chat flipped their shit
[1:45:52] <ricksaintriot> @wsintai don't tell me what to do m8
[1:45:54] <Mrdoctorprofessorhipster> This music plays when people stumble into the closet where I keep my manga collection
[1:45:55] <%Keyd00d> so manys aves
[1:45:55] <cosmicgoatee> It's sad....so sad I could eat a Sub Sadwich
[1:45:56] <+ThatGuyfromMars> @CanonHusbando or even a mostly neutral run. Undyne's death is really heartbreaking
[1:45:57] <megamonmon123> genocide run is basically the eclipse
[1:45:59] <Divryne> !uptime
[1:45:59] <@Moobot> 1h 46m 8s since bed time stories began.
[1:46:00] <Derkinstacker> Paige will never finish the Geno run because of megolovania.
[1:46:01] <+Roundelay11> You're insane if you think they're going to do a genocide run
[1:46:02] <Louie_Salmon> @fangdsniper2nd He catches the stick in his mouth, and using other equipment in a fight swaps them out the audience likes it. This game has an absurd amount of hidden mechanics
[1:46:04] <%GoCoSpace> @ricksaintriot nah we'll do what we want aye big boy
[1:46:06] <misterspotswood> nice
[1:46:07] <%Lets_frown> @ricksaintriot Why be here then? lol
[1:46:08] <+OdysseyKnight> It's almost tiiiime
[1:46:09] <$ToxInjection> I'm guessing Pat will show her videos of the genocide run. I have a feeling Paige wouldn't want to replay the whole thing again meticulously killing every monster.
[1:46:10] <grandmonkbun> They've said that they are gonna do a Genocide run
[1:46:12] <+CanonHusbando> @ThatGuyfromMars or the betrayal kills even
[1:46:15] <ape_hawk> this whole fucking lab is ominous, paige
[1:46:17] <megamonmon123> I just figured it out guys! SANS IS GUTS FROM BERSERK
[1:46:21] <ricksaintriot> I think my point is going over your heads.
[1:46:22] <ghost_teeth> They're gonna play the genocide run
[1:46:23] <+ThatGuyfromMars> @CanonHusbando or killing everyone but papyrus
[1:46:25] <robwob2016> THe munsters
[1:46:27] <+MissMalisin> OhGod
[1:46:28] <+skizzuto> why does it look like a face w/ a heart tho?
[1:46:28] <Louie_Salmon> Paige will NEVER beat genocide
[1:46:28] <FenixSeraph> Sans is Steve After Not Surviving
[1:46:31] <StarSkullyman> I just got why that elevator is there
[1:46:35] <il_barbiero> christ almighty
[1:46:36] <Cheapheatmo> a HEART?!
[1:46:40] <DesuDesuDokiDoki> realy paige?
[1:46:41] <+CanonHusbando> @ThatGuyfromMars how could you even say that
[1:46:43] <Sochin_Iitsu> Yup a heart
[1:46:44] <+TsunamiPoro> A SOULLL
[1:46:45] <Sochin_Iitsu> shush
[1:46:46] <DantesAnimus> oh boi
[1:46:46] <%fangdsniper2nd> @Louie_Salmon Wow I only knew about the stick and eating his own poducts
[1:46:46] <il_barbiero> it's POWERED by a FORSAKEN CHIILD?!?
[1:46:48] <$NocturneNovember> Powered by a forsaken child!
[1:46:49] <+dodge_and_dust> if i remember right you actually can get two different check dialogue if you use check on the true pacifist final boss at the start and at any point after that
[1:46:51] <%ziriken> @Louie_Salmon that's why she isnt going to. pat will be taking controls
[1:46:54] <vivecdidnothingwrong> SASSY

[1:47:29] <laserbeaming> suicide of course
[1:47:32] <Hawkbone_> (she means she was planning to kill herself by the way)
[1:47:33] <@ckbooks> That line is so harsh.
[1:47:34] <$ToxInjection> she's at least admitting she's fucked up
[1:47:36] <DesuDesuDokiDoki> FUCK THIS BITCH

[1:47:46] <gyrogogozeppeli> WORSE THAN GRIFFITH
[1:47:49] <MonsieurHedge> PAIGE HATES SUICIDAL PTSD PEOPLE, more news at 11
[1:47:49] <canadianogre> god alphys is the worst
[1:47:54] <Hawkbone_> Alphys Did Not Intend To Do Anything Wrong
[1:47:55] <%HunterEileen> i cant believe paige has the worst opinions now
[1:47:57] <zamzoph> CoolStoryBob
[1:47:59] <misterspotswood> ok dr mengele, calm down
[1:48:01] <TheyCallMeVawn> So hes basically Aldia from Dark Souls 2 Kappa
[1:48:03] <%ziriken> Thank God she's barren
[1:48:04] <%fangdsniper2nd> Alphys is not a good person BUT she deserves a second chance
[1:48:05] <RyuuAoi> Cosplay Alphys
[1:48:12] <Lieutenant_America> Oh god she really IS Aldia
[1:48:15] <@Calek> Undyne's neutral run fight is probably my favourite moment of the game
[1:48:17] <MainMan_Jonadiah> @misterspotswood PRETTY MUCH, YEAH!
[1:48:18] <%TrevyWeaponsGuy> Alphys did NOTHING wrong
[1:48:21] <InsomniacPersona> It's like Tuvix, they are their own people now technically
[1:48:21] <nyseoul85> Pat why is she southern
[1:48:22] <cosmicgoatee> Plague of Gripes = Alphys
[1:48:22] <Graxe_> Time to kill Alpbys.
[1:48:23] <+OdysseyKnight> I have no monster body and I must scream
[1:48:23] <ricksaintriot> Nobody is a good person, and nobody deserves second chances.
[1:48:23] <+micalica> BEYOND TIME
[1:48:25] <misterspotswood> @MainMan_Jonadiah RIGHT?
[1:48:25] <Hawkbone_> chat is always just Alphys
[1:48:26] <+ThatGuyfromMars> @Calek dude it's heartbreaking
[1:48:27] <yosukecchi> paige as undyne and pat as alphys. make it canon

[1:48:34] <vivecdidnothingwrong> Alphys, Scholar of the First Sin
[1:48:35] <Lieutenant_America> It actually goes better than you'd think
[1:48:36] <canadianogre> let her die
[1:48:37] <MainMan_Jonadiah> "Hey guys, HERE'S YOUR FAMILY!!!"
[1:48:37] <Louie_Salmon> Alphys is chat, except chat probably hasn't created horrible amalgamates
[1:48:37] <%GoCoSpace> Edge!
[1:48:38] <@Calek> instead of just running away
[1:48:39] <buffmurffy> alphys really is the worst, in so many ways
[1:48:39] <ErroneousNickname> Well... they were dead and dying before, and now they're alive
[1:48:43] <DesuDesuDokiDoki> wew
[1:48:44] <%Kataguro> Dental Plan
[1:48:45] <%xijiy> HE DID SAY TO FUSE THEM TOGETHER
[1:48:46] <%TrevyWeaponsGuy> @red_blaster It's Plague just talking, it's not even Pat doing an accent
[1:48:47] <Graxe_> Kill then all, Paige.
[1:48:47] <Valkyrjsen> Here's your wife! She's a horrible goo monster now!
[1:48:48] <RyuuAoi> @hawkbone_ N-not true!
[1:48:48] <ricksaintriot> The only people who deserve second chances are good people, who don't need them.
[1:48:48] <SGrim> It would be the kind thing to just kill all these abominations. She's kind of a... monster DarkMode
[1:48:51] <BenLubar> Lisa needs Braces
[1:48:52] <smokey02> #AlphysDidNothingWrong Kappa

[3:01:07] <+skizzuto> sexy
[3:01:08] <RafflesiaA> These are all things people will buy
[3:01:08] <Dektoide> B1!

[3:01:08] <flame_of_udun_> B E E O N E

[3:01:15] <Elexius> Plush doll of toriel is real FYI
[3:01:16] <Louie_Salmon> @peachsaliva There is a sign that mentions that "It would take the soul of nearly every monster to equal the power of one human soul", And Asriel literally used all the souls except for napstablook to substitute the last soul
[3:01:16] <%RonDewing> its like real life
[3:01:16] <+Picabunny> I bought the plush doll of Toriel with Mettaton's face
[3:01:17] <ricksaintriot> t-shirts
[3:01:21] <Innocuous_Goat> That last one is a real thing you can buy on fangamer

[3:01:32] <Lodestarrobot> call toriel
[3:01:34] <+NafetsTheGreat> Pat, might want to remind her that she named the Fallen Child, not the player character. That might 100% connect the lore for her :).

[3:10:09] <Hunk_Of_Dunk> @PeachSaliva He worked for What Pumpkin doing music for the homestuck game, but Viz Media bought out homestuck and dissolved the team that made the games, which means they all got laid off. Shit sucks real bad.

Frisk grows up and becomes that monster/human relation negotiator. then Monsters and humans eventually fuck and create monster/human hybrids. And in my head-canon-fan-fic I become a body guard, and meat-shield for assassins that go after monsters. and then it basically devolves into the x-men plot-lines

[3:50:20] <Louie_Salmon> These super long names are so dickish
[3:50:21] <FenixSeraph> Paige is better at this than she is at the main game
[3:50:22] <MonsieurHedge> she would literally never get the secret ending
[3:50:23] <+tigerfang86> SHOULD HAVE DODGED EM
[3:50:24] <AncelDeLambert> literally has to hold still
[3:50:25] <swyvar> It's just her dodging instincts from Bloodborne kicking in
[3:50:27] <+AXL808> These credits ain't shit. Nier Automata's Marketing Department was tougher
[3:50:27] <On_Target> Nier Automata end-credits had the best music ever
[3:50:28] <+TomServal> Undertale was a Kickstarter game.
[3:50:29] <+Hamblasto> Pat's doing the Genocide run, right? Can he beat the final boss?
[3:50:29] <+MissMalisin> Paige would die with infinite health

[3:52:54] <Innocuous_Goat> The damage a monster takes is directly determined by how much the person attacking wants to hurt them.
[3:52:55] <%GoCoSpace> sleepy dogoo
[3:52:55] <+tigerfang86> asgore is GREAT
[3:52:59] <WHMBoar> they had other stuff

[3:53:04] <$Doomac> Why was Peach's Coffin empty?
[3:53:04] <NightOwlSam> he murdered CHILDREN

[3:53:07] <Louie_Salmon> You even wake everyone up from the fake dreams like Kamina. This game is Gurren as hell
[3:53:10] <%th3madness> but toriel wanted to go out and PROACTIVELY MURDER

[3:53:17] <+AXL808> All those other humans don't have determination. They gave up on trying to beat Anor Londo
[3:53:18] <buffmurffy> its not clear if he personally killed the kids
[3:53:19] <+Ciphris> asgore should def be tried for murder
[3:53:20] <BenLubar> @Doomac because peach went through the barrier with asriel
[3:53:22] <%ssjklyco> To be fair, it was 6 kids over the course of centuries

[3:53:24] <+LogothX> toby is now asleep
[3:53:24] <serrishtar> he didnt kill anyone, the kids just died in the underground, thats why their gear is scattered around

[3:53:31] <DantesAnimus> awww lookit him slep
[3:53:32] <$thesounddefense> @BenLubar yea the implication is that undyne injected herself with determination
[3:53:32] <Zeikier> Fun? In...Toronto?
[3:53:33] <grenadier42> NO THE PUPPY
[3:53:34] <@DreyfussFrost> Because you're the only REAL human. YOU, the player, are the human, and you only fail if YOU run out of determination. Like Dark Souls hollowing and all that.

[3:53:37] <AncelDeLambert> actually, considering that you find the gear of all the past kids all over the place, many of them probably died before ever reaching Asgore

[4:01:23] <BenLubar> Alphys took dead bodies and put life back in them. She didn't hurt anyone.
[4:01:23] <+NiktenKing> She did it for the dick
[4:01:23] <ricksaintriot> you guys are hypocrites all
[4:01:25] <circular7> she didn't know they would be ghost goo things
[4:01:27] <cereal_box_conspiracy> Alphys was just following orders!
[4:01:28] <%Scales_Tipper> Alphys just wanted to help, it just didn't turn out well
[4:01:29] <+NiktenKing> not because she was told to
[4:01:30] <Worldbrand> right or wrong aside, she was literally trying to help people
[4:01:32] <SGrim> "I was told to do it," Himmler screamed.
[4:01:33] <Louie_Salmon> This is hard to talk about, because there's the part of her that's all anime and stuff, and the part where she did super horrible experiments
[4:01:36] <levitheshark> @PeachSaliva "She was told to" is literally the Nuremburg defense. It doesn't hold up in court.
[4:01:36] <grub> Alphys fucked up big time, but she isn't pure evil. Just... kinda messed up and hid her horrific failures from everyone. Toriel was right to kick her out, though, absolutely.
[4:01:37] <buffmurffy> he's not waiting! he's dreading it
[4:01:38] <+Hilleltaco> It's not like she killed people really
[4:01:39] <SgtSmilies> Asgore doesn't do it because he REALLY doesn't want to at all
[4:01:41] <Innocuous_Goat> And Toriel ran away and let multiple children walk to their death. She never tried to stop him.
[4:01:42] <Hawkbone_> It's because he didn't want to do it
[4:01:47] <viviknight> Let Elmo have the hairband!
[4:01:52] <terminusterminal> I have no idea where this "everybody was children thing" is coming from. I thought some of the fallen had actual jobs.
[4:01:53] <ricksaintriot> you all would be the guys in the Harvard experiments, don't you lie to me
[4:01:56] <Louie_Salmon> Not even him, he makes Undyne and other people kill the kids.
[4:01:58] <salty_syd913> if he did follow with going out and killing 6 outside it probably would have started another war
[4:02:00] <smargh1015> Paige: I cant wait to murder them all because they are not perfect
[4:02:05] <%fangdsniper2nd> Asgore did far worse thanb Alphys
[4:02:05] <MonsieurHedge> pet the sweet baby
[4:02:05] <@PlagueOfGripes> he should have caught humans and then started breeding them. then you could have all the souls you want
[4:02:13] <Liwyn> ^
[4:02:13] <@thenefftw> So tough in that fight you can't lose
[4:02:14] <KoyaMusa> eli no
[4:02:14] <$Mrdoctorprofessorhipster> You can't lose though
[4:02:14] <On_Target> It is literally impossible to lose the Asriel fight
[4:02:16] <Minorou> how mercenary.
[4:02:17] <+tigerfang86> Plague no
[4:02:17] <%superc37> @benlubar ah, wasnt there for that part. couldve sworn that that scene was in the first room of the game during that long walk you take in the end, tho
[4:02:17] <LifesNeverHumDrum> ew
[4:02:18] <%ziriken> @PlagueOfGripes dont breed children
[4:02:18] <$mandragoraroot> pet the piss child
[4:02:18] <%firworks> Paige: "Why couldn't Asgore have just gone out and killed some women? That's what I woulda done!"
[4:02:19] <MonsieurHedge> pet him. he is a good sweet boy and deserves to be petted
[4:02:19] <%ssaryn> Paige is full of a lot of things.
[4:02:21] <+togezzo> Plague has the right idea
[4:02:22] <@PinkieTheEerie> can i ban plauge
[4:02:22] <cizal11> @salty_syd913 probably, but with all the souls he'd win in seconds
[4:02:23] <viviknight> Full of McD's
[4:02:24] <gyrogogozeppeli> jeez
[4:02:24] <bryanmildew> always breeding with you plague
[4:02:26] <Jacknzack27> Thank you for that plauge
[4:02:28] <%Keyd00d> haHAA
[4:02:28] <smargh1015> people are not like your farm animals
[4:02:29] <@PinkieTheEerie> that is the single most fucked thing ive heard
[4:02:30] <Innocuous_Goat> I'm not sure monsters even grasp the concept of human reproduction
[4:02:30] <RubberFistFight> Oh of course you mod their stream @PlagueOfGripes , why am I not surprised? :P
[4:02:32] <Louie_Salmon> @plagueofgripes ... That's super fucked up, but also an AMAZING plan.
[4:02:32] <+NiktenKing> Dammit Plague... that's genius
[4:02:34] <OkamiDude15> L O R E
[4:02:34] <+dodge_and_dust> Asgore isn't waiting for kids to come down. he explicitly doesn't want to kill anyone but his order to kill all humans that fall down gives the others hope htey might one day get out. in reality he did it thinking no human WOULD ever fall diwn there
[4:02:35] <hntronium> Him going out to kill humans would have faced him off against the determination of the entire human race.
[4:02:35] <zaklindo99> @PlagueOfGripes you aren't wrong
[4:02:36] <DeathCubeK138> That's much less shameful
[4:02:36] <KoyaMusa> lore on a twitch sub, really?
[4:02:37] <mtgtin> 8
[4:02:39] <Hawkbone_> @PeachSaliva Asgore and Asriel did far worse things than Alphys yet you guys are totally okay with forgiving them?
[4:02:41] <LifesNeverHumDrum> the limit does not exist
[4:02:41] <%Remery_> 5
[4:02:41] <On_Target> depends whether you have the Wild Card
[4:02:44] <helpmeimafruit> wild card bitches, yeeeeeeeeeeehaw
[4:02:44] <NopeBadguy> WHENS FURSONA FUSION
[4:02:45] <+paladinstarbuster> YOU CAN HAVE TWO PogChamp
[4:02:46] <MonsieurHedge> @PlagueOfGripes i would have volunteered
[4:02:46] <grub> Yes, Asgore could've just raised the humans and just waited for them to die naturally.
[4:02:47] <+ConstipatedLlama> why would there be a limit lmao
[4:02:47] <smargh1015> Plague is the Wild Card of Fursonas
[4:02:48] <%Keyd00d> Plague has said nothing wrong
[4:02:49] <Liwyn> im fursonafluid
[4:02:49] <TheZombiepope> Legal limit of 4 fursonas
[4:02:51] <Dragon_Batman> like a protaganist of a persona huh
[4:02:53] <salty_syd913> @cizal11 true, but then the monsters would just get fucked over by all the other humans
[4:02:54] <$TheSniperJoe> KILL THEM ALL PAIGE
[4:02:55] <$mandragoraroot> u n l i m i t e d f u r s o n a s
[4:02:57] <bathosbathtime> There is no limit because even one is illegal
[4:03:01] <%RonDewing> the government only allowed 4
[4:03:02] <Jacknzack27> Fursona 4 dancing all night
[4:03:03] <salty_syd913> cause determination
[4:03:04] <ricksaintriot> How does "following orders" literally not go for every non-Toriel monster in the underground?
[4:03:06] <+paladinstarbuster> naw
[4:03:07] <BenLubar> @bathosbathtime then the limit is zero

[4:04:06] <+Hilleltaco> @PeachSaliva Oh yeah that brings up something kinda funny, Asriel's attacks and how he talks about "only using a fraction of my real power" are way more dramatic and cheesy than most other things, so there's an idea that it's because he's a kid. He's basically making up cool sounding stuff like a kid does

[4:07:11] <%Keyd00d> You should let Paige do the last fight for a bit
[4:07:11] <RubberFistFight> @Bouldus - with the lupus and the neck vein problem pregnancy is probably a pretty bad idea anyway
[4:07:14] <gyrogogozeppeli> its tedious as fuck
[4:07:14] <BenLubar> pregonate
[4:07:16] <$Agami23> paige showed the cat on twitter. 's a cute busted cat

[4:07:35] <%ziriken> you literally cant
[4:07:36] <Valkyrjsen> I wonder if Pat can do it.

[4:07:50] <helpmeimafruit> monsters aren't people, kill them all
[4:07:50] <+Dingus_Tickler> Playing Genocide personally makes me uncomfortable. You're better off just watching the clips on youtube
[4:07:51] <hntronium> Its not that you can, its that you want to
[4:07:51] <Chocolatevgz> Wew
[4:07:51] <ginfubawuba299> Dont do it

[4:07:54] <$TheSniperJoe> apatCrazyhand apatCrazyhead apatWrong
[4:07:54] <+wingblade7> bitrch its yto choice
[4:07:55] <@Moobot> YOU'RE BEING TOO LOUD! (tequilawolf) (warning)
[4:07:55] <+dodge_and_dust> genocide has a lot of value to it. but it SHOULD be your choice
[4:07:56] <ginfubawuba299> Dont do
[4:07:56] <%fangdsniper2nd> Yes! Exactly
[4:07:56] <CageRedfield> You maybe don’t do it then
[4:07:57] <$Mrdoctorprofessorhipster> Dont do it, you ain't even
[4:07:57] <SGrim> @PeachSaliva you don't have to. We can't MAKE this happen/
[4:07:57] <%th3madness> but there's some cool shit in there tho
[4:07:59] <$Mornaka> IT WILL TEAR YOU UP INSIDE
[4:07:59] <BigBlackSilvio> I WILL SAY YOU SHOULD DO IT
[4:07:59] <IminyourBase> what he's trying to say is do it if you want
[4:07:59] <ginfubawuba299> NO DO
[4:08:00] <+spacehouse> YES YOU SHOULD, OR AT LEAST WAAATCH
[4:08:00] <+SimplyPandaz> It needs to be your choice paige
[4:08:00] <Chocolatevgz> I got to Undyne and my heart gave up
[4:08:00] <%fangdsniper2nd> Great job bad
[4:08:01] <Ropcord> YOU SHOULD DO IT
[4:08:01] <Dragon_Batman> It's not something that really needs to be done.
[4:08:01] <Zombrocom> I am. I am going to tell you you should do it. YOU SHOULD DO IT. FUCKING KILL THEM ALL.
[4:08:02] <RafflesiaA> Kill them all, Peter
[4:08:02] <%caddellzor> PAT STOP HELPING HER
[4:08:02] <reonome> KILL THEM ALL
[4:08:02] <%ziriken> Give each boss 5 tries
[4:08:02] <Eresus> nobody should play the genocide route
[4:08:03] <swyvar> You should not
[4:08:04] <QuanticEline> Pat gets it.
[4:08:05] <+SeroSedLaeto> You're only doing this because you think you can. And because you can, you think you should.
[4:08:06] <DeathCubeK138> Yeah it's a pretty simple concept
[4:08:06] <grenadier42> The game explains this perfectly fine, you don't have to fucking overexplain it
[4:08:06] <Ssaik> The game KNOWS that because you CAN, you think you SHOULD
[4:08:06] <Bouldus> @RubberFistFight you mean the way Paige was lol?
[4:08:07] <+Dragonfang1337> DON'T WORRY PAT I GET IT
[4:08:07] <Cheapheatmo> seriously, Paige
[4:08:08] <+TheGershon> Eh we want you too
[4:08:08] <ginfubawuba299> DONT DO
[4:08:09] <Louie_Salmon> I mean, do it though.
[4:08:09] <%fangdsniper2nd> Great job Pat!
[4:08:09] <demonhunter790> Isn’t the finale like you only do it because you wanna see what happens
[4:08:10] <BigBlackSilvio> IT IS TO BE EXPECTED
[4:08:11] <Hydrapissed> Pat gets it.
[4:08:11] <$mandragoraroot> its just an extra thing
[4:08:11] <NMEDom> your chat demands blood
[4:08:11] <+fireking900> ITS YOUR CHOICE
[4:08:11] <bamboosprout> Pat, please explain to peach who peach is!
[4:08:12] <%ssaryn> CANCEL GENOCIDE RUN PAIGE OH GOD
[4:08:12] <tequilawolf> LEAVE THEM ALONE
[4:08:12] <CurrySauseBandit> This is literally the most straight up Pat has been
[4:08:12] <autismweaponised> KILL MURDER DEATH
[4:08:12] <+Samori79> by the end shell understand
[4:08:13] <+Atomik456> DON'T DO IT
[4:08:13] <Kipss> the whole point of the genocide run isnt that its a part of the game, like an extra ending after nier, but that its more content that only slightly sheds some light on some characters and the world as a whole.
[4:08:13] <DarkVinceX> Don't
[4:08:13] <KoyaMusa> ITS THAT ITS AN OPTION
[4:08:16] <zmuno> She is sooo confused
[4:08:16] <%mitchteck> Don't be a evil bastard
[4:08:16] <+tigerfang86> DO
[4:08:17] <the_phantom_theif> Pat likes being vague.
[4:08:17] <ginfubawuba299> NO KILL
[4:08:17] <OkamiDude15> @PeachSaliva just cuz you can do something doesnt mean you should
[4:08:18] <On_Target> @grenadier42 COnsidering who he's talking to....
[4:08:18] <%fangdsniper2nd> Perfect ecplaination
[4:08:18] <ThePuddingDead> listen carefully what he's saying paige
[4:08:19] <Belutima> FREE WILL too complicated of a concept doodBait
[4:08:19] <tequilawolf> THEY HAD A HARD LIFE
[4:08:20] <ginfubawuba299> DONT kill
[4:08:20] <BigBlackSilvio> DO IT
[4:08:21] <%firworks> I should ruin everyones happiness - Peach "Pol Pot" Saliva
[4:08:21] <pectusumbra> Pat gets to be the stand once again
[4:08:26] <circular7> you learn almost nothing in the genocide route
[4:08:27] <ginfubawuba299> DO NOT KILL
[4:08:27] <Derkinstacker> Pat keeps touching himself.
[4:08:29] <DeathCubeK138> When I was a very young child my mother told me that just because you CAN do something doesn't mean you SHOULD
[4:08:29] <serrishtar> only afer loving and killing everyone can you understand the true meaning of christmas
[4:08:29] <+Atomik456> NOPE
[4:08:31] <%ssaryn> sipsipElmo sipsipElmo sipsipElmo sipsipElmo sipsipElmo sipsipElmo
[4:08:31] <RubberFistFight> @Bouldus - no, Paige spring fully-formed from the outer realms.
[4:08:33] <Louie_Salmon> I do very much appreciate that Pat is setting this up right.
[4:08:33] <thelovingfool> SO DENSE
[4:08:36] <ginfubawuba299> DONT KILL
[4:08:37] <@thenefftw> I never played through Genocide and just looked it up. I'm kinda glad I did so
[4:08:37] <$mandragoraroot> BlessRNG
[4:08:40] <%Remery_> Paige is just a Pokemon that learned how to talk, pay her no mind
[4:08:42] <Chocolatevgz> You got the good ending
[4:08:43] <Mnightshyamallama> pat is trying to say the fandom was kinda terrible as far as telling people how to play the game
[4:08:44] <Chocolatevgz> You can stop
[4:08:45] <DeathCubeK138> This is like that except you are an adult and can't understand
[4:08:51] <Chocolatevgz> You can also continue
[4:08:53] <SilentEric> You don't have to
[4:08:53] <%ziriken> I replayed genocided past few days. it hurts your soul
[4:08:56] <Bouldus> @RubberFistFight lol ok, really tho
[4:08:58] <Chichen> I want to see pure evil paige
[4:08:59] <+SagatAteMyCornFlakes> Flowey said it too
[4:09:00] <%ssaryn> @thenefftw Same actually, I immediately looked at it and said NOPE
[4:09:01] <smargh1015> im glad i did it, its so worth seeing its amazing
[4:09:05] <DesuDesuDokiDoki> w o w
[4:09:06] <%Keyd00d> D:
[4:09:08] <Dragon_Batman> This a thing now?
[4:09:09] <cosmicgoatee> @PeachSaliva Pat if you're doing it MAKE SURE to get *that one hidden character*
[4:09:12] <IFlaske> do it! but don't tho
[4:09:16] <hntronium> I prefer OFF over Undertale
[4:09:16] <@Moobot> We're accepting fanfiction submissions, if you think you have a good one message a mod today!
[4:09:18] <RubberFistFight> @Bouldus - that's why the lupus and vein problem. The eldritch powers didn't quite know how to construct a human shell and got a few things wrong.
[4:09:18] <ricksaintriot> "playing" is right.
[4:09:18] <+TheGershon> Nice cover Pat!
[4:09:18] <Chocolatevgz> The other way of playing is fucking boring, honestly. Ever grinded in Dragon Quest 1? Yeah.
[4:09:24] <autismweaponised> death kill die murder time
[4:09:31] <Dostendite1> Phallus.
[4:09:36] <ricksaintriot> OFF is so much better!
[4:09:37] <RubberFistFight> @Bouldus - and we all know Pat is a ginger rage elemental.
[4:09:44] <+dodge_and_dust> SAVE the woirld
[4:09:45] <%superc37> and also "His Theme"
[4:09:47] <DesuDesuDokiDoki> HOW CAN THIS BE
[4:09:47] <Louie_Salmon> @hntronium I think Undertale is way more ambitious, but OFF is really good
[4:09:47] <Valkyrjsen> Well, Genocide is kind of tedious in general, but when it goes off, it goes off.
[4:09:48] <Bouldus> @RubberFistFight nah the early give up machines just have some flaws
[4:09:49] <ginfubawuba299> OFF IS COOL
[4:09:51] <$TheSniperJoe> Gingers have the most spiral power?
[4:09:56] <2hutown> I started Undertale with an unspoilered Genocide run.. That was a thing.
[4:09:56] <+WorthlessSamurai> D:
[4:09:59] <Chocolatevgz> RIP
[4:10:01] <serrishtar> @PeachSaliva definitely look up how to hoard the best healing items throughout genocide, itll make things a lot easier
[4:10:02] <$TheSniperJoe> KILLTHEMALL
[4:10:03] <ricksaintriot> OFF is unified in theme.
[4:10:03] <IminyourBase> paige's soul spot was filled with lupus
[4:10:04] <+tigerfang86> YEYEYYE
[4:10:05] <autismweaponised> YYYEEEEEEESSSS
[4:10:06] <Stab_master_ars0n> Genocide route is best route. The grinding sucks though.
[4:10:09] <Bouldus> @RubberFistFight especially Paiges model
[4:10:10] <%caddellzor> YYYYYAAAASSSSS
[4:10:11] <not_machoman> do it on pats computer
[4:10:11] <$mandragoraroot> hell yeah
[4:10:12] <KoyaMusa> You know, you can just not.
[4:10:13] <%fangdsniper2nd> Asgore's theme is my favorite in the pacifist run
[4:10:14] <%mitchteck> You hearless bastards
[4:10:14] <+Nefarious_Bear> YEYEYEYE
[4:10:14] <nckman09> 1989 - WEDNESDAY
[4:10:17] <QuanticEline> BOOO
[4:10:18] <%ssaryn> Many Futa Face Fucking for Pat.
[4:10:20] <+wingblade7> @PeachSaliva pineapple juice and selzter water for the throat m8
[4:10:20] <%ziriken> Dont worry pat. you dont have to do the voice for long
[4:10:21] <not_machoman> so paige's papyrus doesn't die
[4:10:22] <%Remery_> Futa Paige <3
[4:10:22] <gslayer14> KILL EM ALL 201X
[4:10:24] <Chocolatevgz> It's really fucking hard though, I dunno if Peach will make it
[4:10:30] <$mandragoraroot> monkaS
[4:10:33] <%mcrohan9595> Pats feet
[4:10:33] <ricksaintriot> that's why peach won't do it
[4:10:34] <KoyaMusa> paige won't play it, pat will
[4:10:37] <Chocolatevgz> lol
[4:10:38] <TheImmortal70> HAHA
[4:10:38] <$oxiderous> 20 YEARS IN THE ELECTRIC CHAIR
[4:10:39] <RubberFistFight> @Bouldus - maybe she's a robot from the outer realms constructed by the eldritch horrors. We can BOTH be right,
[4:10:41] <+SagatAteMyCornFlakes> Lol
[4:10:41] <+Hilleltaco> It's kinda playing a bit on the idea that a player will explore every option regardless of morality just to see everything
[4:10:44] <DesuDesuDokiDoki> leg disabled
[4:10:46] <Chocolatevgz> Yeah
[4:10:48] <TheImmortal70> You waited years for it and you just now realize it fuckin sucks
[4:10:50] <serrishtar> jerry duty? thats the worst
[4:10:51] <Dakuu75> I use "chrones disease" as my go-to excuse for that, and it always works
[4:10:52] <LifesNeverHumDrum> the laptop looks like a censor bar for pat's feet
[4:10:57] <ricksaintriot> duh. get the most game for your money.
[4:10:58] <IminyourBase> just tell them you are incredibly racist. it works for me everytime
[4:10:58] <ghost_teeth> I want to see Paige make the decisions and Pat play the bosses
[4:10:58] <OfficerMods> just skip it
[4:10:59] <autismweaponised> get ready to hold up and down at the same time a lot
[4:11:01] <%ThePushaMan> That sounded like a rick and morty sketch
[4:11:02] <FrostedZaibatsu> You cant excape Jury Duty tppowerFree
[4:11:02] <Chocolatevgz> Which is why it's really important to not spoil this game
[4:11:06] <Prevot> I'd never want Paige in MY jury
[4:11:08] <OfficerMods> only cowards go to jury duty
[4:11:11] <Chocolatevgz> HEAR THAT RANDOM FRIEND
[4:11:17] <mtgtin> OOF
[4:11:18] <SilentEric> She is no one's peer
[4:11:19] <werunos> shut down
[4:11:20] <$mandragoraroot> LUL
[4:11:20] <$Mornaka> McDonalds and BABIES?
[4:11:24] <SGrim> @PeachSaliva you could probably just inform the government you have Lupis and get out of Jury Duty forever. I have a friend who has chronic migraines, and that was enough.
[4:11:26] <ricksaintriot> Lupus? in MY jury duty??
[4:11:31] <ricksaintriot> it's more likely than you think
[4:11:35] <%Admiral_PopnFresh> Jury Duty? more like Juri Doody Kreygasm
[4:11:37] <%Remery_> Dont feed the Baby mcdonalds
[4:11:39] <+wingblade7> !hooker
[4:11:40] <@Moobot> It has been 0 Days 0 Hours 0 Minutes since last being mistaken for a hooker.
[4:11:43] <Worldbrand> damn

[4:12:00] <DesuDesuDokiDoki> fuck her
[4:12:01] <MainMan_Jonadiah> I can't believe Paige hates Eli
[4:12:02] <emillionghost> alphys sucks as a person
[4:12:03] <$Mornaka> eli is a southern gentalman
[4:12:03] <RubberFistFight> @Remery_ - if they had a child it wouldn't eat human food. It'd eat the hopes and dreams of all those around it.
[4:12:04] <zamzoph> naw, Alphys just sucks
[4:12:05] <+SagatAteMyCornFlakes> Can’t make it to jury duty, cuz I’m banging right now Kappa
[4:12:07] <bryanmildew> that IS how all southerners talk
[4:12:08] <helpmeimafruit> Kenny did nothing wrong
[4:12:09] <Louie_Salmon> @ricksaintriot But it doesn't have a 100 song OST, and the water SFX are literally a dude splashing water in a tub, and it doesn't have any of the dialogue changes on repeat playthroughs and secret interactions like this
[4:12:10] <Bouldus> thats your accent Paige
[4:12:10] <+Snaketsu> Asriel a good boy BibleThump
[4:12:12] <%caddellzor> her best is literally ABOMINATION MURDER

[4:12:29] <sosuke5> Eli's voice is silky honey

[4:12:31] <Liwyn> beep beep
[4:12:31] <ricksaintriot> @Louie_Salmon yeah, one guy does have limited resources like that.
[4:12:32] <bryanmildew> do we know for sure if plague even has feet
[4:12:33] <Stab_master_ars0n> Flowey and sans are the most satisfying deaths, sucks that asgore was spared from chara.
[4:12:33] <terminusterminal> Boy howdy no it isn't
[4:12:34] <+paladinstarbuster> "ang out"
[4:12:36] <FrostedZaibatsu> The only reason people hate Alphys is because she represents most of the people playing the game LUL

[4:12:37] <swyvar> He's a farmer, probably not

[4:12:41] <SaltyDongs> Shrodingers feet
[4:12:46] <+jorgamund> we've never actually seen Plague's legs on camera...

[4:12:49] <reonome> NTR
[4:12:50] <ThePuddingDead> isntuh
[4:12:51] <RubberFistFight> Eli only sounds a little bit southern, to my Australian ears.
[4:12:54] <%Keyd00d> elmo dead
[4:12:55] <velemi> Alphys is a bad person who ultimately makes a genuine effort to be better
[4:13:02] <@PlagueOfGripes> I lost my legs in the wars
[4:13:04] <MonsieurHedge> chapstick is delicious
[4:13:04] <RubberFistFight> Paige doesn't sound it at all
[4:13:05] <%Remery_> Can we see Plague's feet?
[4:13:10] <ricksaintriot> OFF also doesn't pretend like your choices matter
[4:13:12] <%ziriken> But what about your feet
[4:13:15] <$TheSniperJoe> Yeah, you need to hang in there.
[4:13:16] <Worldbrand> playing it right after undertale would take a lot of the impact away
[4:13:18] <ricksaintriot> doesn't treat you like a moron
[4:13:20] <%Keyd00d> PUT THE BOOTS ON
[4:13:20] <MainMan_Jonadiah> DDLC's pace is glacial at best.
[4:13:21] <MonsieurHedge> @PlagueOfGripes post feet on twitter pls
[4:13:21] <@thenefftw> It takes 2 hours to get to the meat of this 4 hour game

[4:13:38] <@thenefftw> Pretty Derby
[4:13:41] <Chocolatevgz> DDLC seems neat, but I don't like VNs much so it'd be hard for me to get invested in
[4:13:42] <the_phantom_theif> Matt's super impatient though
[4:13:42] <+dodge_and_dust> i don't think DDLC would be a good choice right after undertale. they are both very dialogue heavy

[4:17:28] <ricksaintriot> wrong, homestuck was always bad
[4:17:30] <grenadier42> Duck Figibro

[4:17:37] <TheElegantMan> @PlagueOfGripes i <3 u
[4:17:38] <smargh1015> whats dicgibros deal?
[4:17:39] <On_Target> To this day I barely know what homestuck is
[4:17:42] <Cheapheatmo> I'll be honest, the bit where he made fun of kids' artwork was funny for its time
[4:17:43] <FrostedZaibatsu> Know about what?
[4:17:45] <SilentEric> Homestuck was fun at many times
[4:17:45] <clamlamity> Digi "Lolis SHould Be Legal" Bro
[4:17:47] <%superc37> wait 3 hour lecture about what
[4:17:48] <velemi> Homestuck is great and also awful
[4:17:49] <Garthunox> Whats wrong with Digi?
[4:17:52] <SGrim> Maddox was some fuck, who wasn't funny, and decided to file a 20 million dollar lawsuit against Dick Masterson. Short version. SeemsGood
[4:17:54] <+paladinstarbuster> He's a self absorbed douvhe
[4:17:54] <+NiktenKing> Digibro can be a real shitbag
[4:17:55] <+kukadin> All you have to pay him is one loli
[4:17:56] <MainMan_Jonadiah> It's hilarious, he talks about how "PeachSaliva USED to date one of the TWO best friend guys... I don't know their names."
[4:17:57] <+spacehouse> Serial Murderers ARE precious
[4:17:58] <reonome> the dick/maddox drama
[4:17:59] <Louie_Salmon> @smargh1015 He's a brony, so people hate him for no reason
[4:18:03] <scravvy> I think it's the shortest pcp lecture it's like 2 hours
[4:18:04] <fattyboy067> he's a kid into edgelord form
[4:18:06] <Garthunox> Did he do something?
[4:18:06] <MonsieurHedge> homestuck defined my entire personality and ARADIA IS BEST GIRL
[4:18:11] <$Mrdoctorprofessorhipster> He's a kid he's a squid
[4:18:14] <Buteman> The final form is his edgy anime OC
[4:18:16] <thelovingfool> the first half of Homestuck is good, falls apart though
[4:18:17] <%BunkusFreskie> @PlagueOfGripes is gonna be annoyed by my next donation
[4:18:17] <@Moobot> Do you have a Fanfiction for Paige to read? Submit it to us here and it may get read on stream! http://bit.ly/2jsxJo9

[4:18:22] <ricksaintriot> uhhh people don't hate digibro because of the brony stuff.
[4:18:23] <serrishtar> everything in battle isnt in the physical world, its a battle of souls
[4:18:24] <MainMan_Jonadiah> @scravvy Tommy Oliver's Guilty Gear lecture is pretty amazing.

[4:19:40] <thelovingfool> not the only thing
[4:19:40] <ricksaintriot> What's that about?
[4:19:40] <waterstealer> kinda
[4:19:41] <ADeadDiehard> You wish.
[4:19:42] <ghost_teeth> You have to buy the game a second time

[4:29:38] <FenixSeraph> No it’s actually said that Asgore takes walks around his kingdom
[4:29:39] <hntronium> He declared war
[4:29:40] <clamlamity> "serial murderer" maybe he didnt kill them tho
[4:29:44] <+WingBuffet> this is like how people looked at all kinds of phonetic translations of 'Chara' as if they were significant/intentional
[4:29:52] <RubberFistFight> elmo's lifting his paw like he wants to do something
[4:29:52] <doubleodette> bob and the dancing mushroom are the ones that killed the humans
[4:29:53] <$TheSniperJoe> And we are all together.

[4:30:12] <MainMan_Jonadiah> He killed them like Alphys killed all those monsters... Oh wait, she didn't kill them, she turned them into horrible monsters for the rest of their lives.
[4:30:12] <TrapprZ> Genocide is the cannon ending
[4:30:16] <$Mornaka> SHE ADMITS IT
[4:30:16] <KoyaMusa> THEN DON'T, ITS FINE

[4:31:38] <ricksaintriot> some might say "needlessly complex"
[4:31:42] <Elexius> Toriel and Asgore had a daughter?!?
[4:31:44] <yodajr99> did I miss the deaths
[4:31:49] <%HotBloodedHero> But no, they didn't stay fused.

[4:32:21] <ricksaintriot> Aldyne, or Unphys?
[4:32:25] <MainMan_Jonadiah> Yes it is, silly.

[4:36:28] <+Sayie> Genocide is actually super short, way shorter than True Pacifict
[4:36:28] <smargh1015> the genocide run is also tedious and not fun at times
[4:36:35] <GarettLefebvr> dumboldor was a dream the whole time
[4:36:39] <Rellim80> Gen-o-cide
[4:36:40] <$oxiderous> STREAM POISON

[4:36:42] <+cvp5127> gotta kill them all
[4:36:42] <@DreyfussFrost> It could be the shortest or the longest route.
[4:36:43] <ricksaintriot> sounds like the rest of the game
[4:36:44] <TropicalPsychosis> Pacifist, more like PUSSYfist
[4:36:44] <terminusterminal> Just do the genocide run with a safe word?
