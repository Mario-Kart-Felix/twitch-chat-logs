[0:08:54] <+BedHome> But wheres Sand's Unders Tale
[0:09:01] <+Fooguwu> I could name a daughter Gurley. It'd end up either being accurate or cool and ironic
[0:09:25] <Jetsfantasy> She sounds like she has commitment issues
[0:09:25] <%Kurt_0> LUL
[0:09:30] <+Fooguwu> like calling a big guy Tiny

[0:42:46] <%MarylandJutsu> Pat did the same Star Wars sand joke taht you did
[0:43:17] <%maskofmichael> Between her legs?
[0:43:25] <Wydamn> I always like games with this camera perspective
[0:43:38] <%ComfortableStranger> so apparently a quarter of the internet in the US is down
[0:43:57] <%ComfortableStranger> bunch of services are inaccessible
[0:44:19] <%MarylandJutsu> woof
[0:44:22] <Wydamn> whoah, what?
[0:44:23] <%ComfortableStranger> a major isp got shut down some how
[0:44:24] <Wydamn> damn
[0:44:27] <%ComfortableStranger> that's all I knwo
[0:44:29] <%holydeviant1> woah that's nuts
[0:44:33] <+MisterAvry> sucks to suck
[0:44:34] <%MarylandJutsu> Also apparently you and Pat make up 50% of the twitch streams playing this game
[0:44:47] <%holydeviant1> Hope it doesn't effect my work. Affect? mrgh
[0:44:53] <mr_saturday93> huh I guess VA is fine cuz I have zero problems so far
[0:45:10] <%ComfortableStranger> @mr_saturday93 depends on what you're trying to access
[0:45:25] <%ComfortableStranger> Destiny 2 and ESO are down
[0:45:35] <%BinaryFireball> west coast good
[0:45:36] <+ThomasOfTroy> Source on this interest outage? I see literally no news on it online
[0:45:48] <dukenux> That last time twitch was down it was because an amazon server farm was hit. also a platform like 20% of all the internet adresses
[0:46:18] <dukenux> *for
[0:46:47] <%OfficioPrefectusCorgi> Ello PR Ma'am
[0:47:40] <%ComfortableStranger> only other people
[0:48:03] <%ComfortableStranger> ***
[0:49:09] <%maskofmichael> Of course there's no news about an internet outage on the internet, people without it can't post about it lol
[0:49:20] <+ThomasOfTroy> @ComfortableStranger If this was a url, can you whisper it to me?
[0:49:29] <%TheWinged7> pat has made the exact character you predicted @PeachSaliva
[0:49:30] <+Fooguwu> i cant believe ive got two gingers on my computer at once
[0:49:36] <%SharkMissile> Omg Black Mirror
[0:49:38] <%SovPho> That's... stupid. That's not how that works at all.
[0:50:12] <%MarylandJutsu> yep pat did exactly what we thought he'd do
[0:50:32] <%SovPho> @PeachSaliva There are intermediate router services that makeup the "backbone" of the internet that are owned by nonprofits that have alert systems that inform about large outages.
[0:51:10] <%MarylandJutsu> On this island? i love taht musical
[0:51:23] <%maskofmichael> LUL He owes him wood
[0:51:28] <%SharkMissile> RIGHT?!
[0:51:33] <%MarylandJutsu> yeah this music good
[0:51:38] <%MarylandJutsu> give that person a raise
[0:51:58] <%SharkMissile> Whaaaat
[0:52:20] <%MarylandJutsu> i love this boat design
[0:52:30] <%JimmyRuss> DJA VU
[0:52:43] <%SovPho> neat
[0:52:53] <%MarylandJutsu> oh yeah for sure. wind waker meets Prince of persia
[0:52:53] <+ThomasOfTroy> Okay, looking at the link ComfortableStranger, it's not that ~25% of the US is having outages, it's that a bunch of services are reporting access issues but only in small numbers (verizon is the highest, with about 550 reports as of 4pm)
[0:53:03] <+ThomasOfTroy> ComfortableStranger sent me*
[0:53:12] <%OfficioPrefectusCorgi> Great driving
[0:53:36] <%ComfortableStranger> @ThomasOfTroy TBH I'm just repeating what a few people told me, and I can't get on to a number of games and services
[0:54:02] <%OfficioPrefectusCorgi> The Best driver  Whose big and Strong
[0:54:03] <CrimsonFox777> She says as she nearly rams into a large rock.
[0:54:04] <%MarylandJutsu> I mean a boat and a car are kinda different
[0:54:15] <CommanderCOOL> oh this game looks cool
[0:54:44] <@MelBrooksKA> Remember guys, Paige has never been in an accident (that she has caused...)
[0:54:50] <%MarylandJutsu> well so far....pretty cool
[0:55:08] <+ThomasOfTroy> @ComfortableStranger I mean this as not shittily as possible, but it's not good form to spread hearsay
[0:55:34] <%MarylandJutsu> lots of candles huh
[0:55:37] <@MelBrooksKA> @MarylandJutsu Less so on super old cars that steered with a boat till
[0:56:10] <@MelBrooksKA> But I think that was even pre-Ford Model T
[0:56:50] <%MarylandJutsu> oh yeah for sure
[0:56:58] <%MarylandJutsu> but i dont think paige has a really old model
[0:57:01] <%MarylandJutsu> or i would guess?
[0:57:51] <%MarylandJutsu> oh that blood splatter is nice
