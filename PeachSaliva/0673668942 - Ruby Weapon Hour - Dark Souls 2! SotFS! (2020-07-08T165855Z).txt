[2:44:14] <fruit_pie_the_magician> Whichever side thats attacking you is the head. Always attack the butt
[2:44:14] <MachetePhD> So lemme get this right- This thing is a 2 headed giant spider that spits lasers out of it's mouth?
[2:44:14] <dauver> and so they fought for 3 days and 3 nights
[2:44:16] <Coystick> Gonna be real, I like her Design

[2:51:50] <TofuNyan> PP Hype <3
[2:51:50] <+Mkingston> It's better that TLOU2
[2:51:51] <Zombrocom> It's quite the odd duck, DS2 is
[2:51:51] <%Th3SmartAlec> TLOU2 of Dark Souls
[2:51:52] <$DesertPenguin> It's just trying too hard :(
[2:51:52] <TheFramedWarlock> Dark Souls 2 is the bad game
[2:51:55] <arthur33344> DK Host/Raid
[2:51:55] <$Sphincter_Spelunker> "Artorias was left handed" -DS2
[2:51:56] <DKDiamantes> Dark Souls II is the only one I didnt play
[2:51:57] <%Lunarhawk> Cowardice?
[2:51:59] <+BigCoffee> Why is the souls 2 story bad?
[2:51:59] <SivSarcast> Dark Souls 2 seems like a sidestory fanfic.
[2:52:04] <hawkhollywood> Ivory King is still dope
[2:52:09] <$DesertPenguin> Anyone read the Design Works interview for DS2?
[2:52:09] <%Typhaeon> Dark Souls 2 is the Last Jedi of Dark Souls
[2:52:09] <snarfoogle> oh the coiled sword was snapped on the primal bonfire
[2:52:11] <weissguard> dkdiaButt quiettAh
[2:52:11] <Valdorick> Ivory King is the ONLY cool thing
[2:52:13] <bluefooddye1> DS3 is just as fucking stupid
[2:52:13] <Zombrocom> I still like DS2 though
[2:52:13] <TheArrow_> there's not much about ds2 that i like
[2:52:13] <bigshedman> I like that DS2 at least did more of its own thing, rather than just regurgitate DS1 lore and leaving a bunch of threads hanging.
[2:52:13] <shadow1man9> DS2 is still a much better game than TLOU2
[2:52:15] <DandyMackeroos> @sivsarcast It kinda is
[2:52:16] <YakumoYomi> @TurtlesAndTentacles I suppose that explains why she left suddenly
[2:52:21] <+SaphronBlackbourne> DS2 is garbo
[2:52:21] <+patriotrenegade> What is the nature of a king???
[2:52:21] <venomfury86> Best game Kappa
[2:52:22] <2fcd_twitch> Does it?
[2:52:22] <+LouieRouie> Lore from the poisoned well
[2:52:27] <%Th3SmartAlec> Has it?'
[2:52:29] <Mr_Mushie> its a mess and thats without its dark souls 1 connections
[2:52:31] <+SaphronBlackbourne> Fun to watch tho
[2:52:32] <$Sphincter_Spelunker> snaggle tooth
[2:52:44] <%linSP> but ds2 is the only good one eli
[2:52:45] <Ianrazz> DS2 is not a bad game guys. Its good video game with stupid lore
[2:52:46] <TheFramedWarlock> DS2 is so bad
[2:52:49] <+xeros720> smash them with your big hammer paige
[2:52:50] <Dingalow> I saw MatthewMatosis' video on DS2 and that's all I need
[2:52:50] <Ekaelis> Mauler disgrees with that statement LUL
[2:52:51] <+AEUG_Ace_Kamille> @Sphincter_Spelunker I heard that that was a hint DS2 in a mirrow world since you went under the lake, the world is reversed.
[2:52:51] <+Ultimate_Edge> Ds2 feels like an arcade-y souls game
[2:52:51] <+necrocannibal2> Dark Souls 2 fucking sucks
[2:52:52] <+StreamStopA> get Peach the chicken leg
[2:53:00] <+xeros720> all the men quiver in fear by the sheer size of it
[2:53:02] <$DesertPenguin> DS2 is a good game. It's an okay Souls game
[2:53:05] <+michingmallecho> Dark souls 2 is alright psaSmug
[2:53:11] <DandyMackeroos> DS2 feels good to play
[2:53:14] <DatAsuna> When's power stance?
[2:53:15] <+Shadicara> Going clubbing I see Kappa
[2:53:15] <+Kingtut9009> DS2 had some of the best pvp and support of any of the series, it's PvE is trash imo
[2:53:17] <CandyCoatedConfection> ds2 doesn't deserve this vitriol BibleThump
[2:53:18] <WhatzePh> DS2 is fine
[2:53:18] <%Th3SmartAlec> LUL
[2:53:20] <TheFramedWarlock> DS2 is a bad game and an abysmal Souls game
[2:53:22] <+lethallylactic> LUL
[2:53:22] <TurtlesAndTentacles> @YakumoYomi Yeah That does explain alot
[2:53:22] <+necrocannibal2> if you like your character moving like he's covered in molasses, there's something wrong with your head
[2:53:29] <+fingalights> Havel big cool though Eli
[2:53:32] <+xeros720> did you guys know this game might be a sequel to Evergrace?
[2:53:33] <$DesertPenguin> It's honestly fine. People that shit on it are try-hards or something
[2:53:35] <%Lunarhawk> im excited to return to the problems of the greatsword where she cant hit anything cause it swings directly int front of her
[2:53:35] <%Typhaeon> Penal club with penor mask
[2:53:35] <2fcd_twitch> I hate Dark Souls 2 but I can see why people like it.
[2:53:38] <Laecerelius> Paige wielding her huge boner
[2:53:45] <%Savages4Blood> the lore isnt even that complicated though. it's just 3 games of carrying lighter fluid across the lands to pour it in some special fire
[2:53:46] <cardboardboots> almost full havel
[2:53:56] <%linSP> Ds2 rides off the notoriety ds1 had for being tough, that They even count all deaths worldwide
[2:53:58] <$DesertPenguin> health
[2:54:03] <+The_Butterfly_Man> ds2 is great dont you love your health being lowered every time you die and it being a game where you are supposed to die a lot
[2:54:05] <Ianrazz> @necrocannibal2 If you have different opinion than me, there is something wrong with you
[2:54:06] <+BigCoffee> wait is 3 bad ?
[2:54:08] <RushUnplugged> oh good, it's time to suck DS1's cock again and shit on anything else
[2:54:08] <SuttonsGaming> Bearer... Seek... Seek... Lest...
[2:54:10] <$DesertPenguin> HEALTH
[2:54:12] <SilverFaustX> why is adp 32
[2:54:16] <$Sphincter_Spelunker> Oh I love the weapons and armor. Power Stance is the best part of 2
[2:54:17] <%SvenHolgersson> They wouldn't lie about poise in DS3
[2:54:17] <DandyMackeroos> @savages4blood That depends on if you want to be the lighter fluid
[2:54:19] <%Th3SmartAlec> INT
[2:54:21] <Copious_Koopies> STAMINA
[2:54:22] <+BigCoffee> What levelling mistake?
[2:54:23] <$DesertPenguin> ADP is 32 for best i-frames
[2:54:23] <%SvenHolgersson> I mean that would just be cruel
[2:54:24] <TheZearGuy> I swear, one day she’ll kill the herald with that hammer.
[2:54:24] <%Th3SmartAlec> She really needs it
[2:54:25] <$Sphincter_Spelunker> but fuck ADP
[2:54:30] <+xeros720> @SilverFaustX you're gonna say paige doesn't need the faster drink speed?
[2:54:34] <$DesertPenguin> VIGOR
[2:54:34] <Ekaelis> I wonder if Demon Souls remake does it too
[2:54:36] <SaltkeyAndAckfish> paige needs some int
[2:54:37] <fruit_pie_the_magician> DS2 is not different enough from DS1 to warrant the amount of hate it gets. With minor changes, they're the same game, and in a lot of ways it's improved
[2:54:38] <Dingalow> Dead air
[2:54:38] <TheFramedWarlock> Level INT
[2:54:39] <Zombrocom> vigor goes to 20 then 40 than 99 I think?
[2:54:41] <cardboardboots> just dump vigor to stay alive
[2:54:42] <xanerts> judt put a lady to every bonfire that would be cool
[2:54:44] <laserbeaming> 50 STR already? Damn
[2:54:44] <%Savages4Blood> @dandymackeroos depends on how done the game has made me at that point lmal
[2:54:46] <$DesertPenguin> Basically just VIGOR or ENDURANCE
[2:54:46] <star_feline> So Pat is the brains and Paige is the brawn?
[2:54:47] <%Savages4Blood> lmao
[2:54:50] <KaiserMario> PLAGUE HELP THEM
[2:54:56] <+Arkfyre> Oh look, it's time for the daily session of everyone telling you their opinion on dark souls 2. I'm glad we're still doing this years later.
[2:54:57] <+StreamStopA> faith
[2:54:58] <$DesertPenguin> Health or Stamina, that's your gameplan right now
[2:54:59] <SummonerMagno> all int
[2:54:59] <%linSP> 99 adp run when
[2:55:08] <$DesertPenguin> I'd suggest pumping Vigor so you can tank more hits

[3:09:02] <TheoTTree> By far the longest and the worst, love it
[3:09:04] <%Th3SmartAlec> Paige: "I may have made a mistake"
[3:09:06] <WhatzePh> You can always make her a pawn in Dragon's Dogma and then throw her to your heart's contyent.
[3:09:07] <%Lunarhawk> She couldve done it if she streamed 3 times a week all summer sipsipHellmo
[3:09:07] <+cdrom321> Don't give up, Paige. We love you.

[3:10:20] <Shishi1205> are they not puppets or sth
[3:10:22] <$zyberion626> I genuinely think the only way Paige can do this is if she played several days in a row, she forgets to much in between streams
[3:10:23] <Coystick> God this lighting looks worse than Fullbright mode
[3:10:25] <Srthunda> they used to wobble
[3:10:25] <CappuccinoGuil> "Did that guy see me?" "Yeah" *dude comes from behind the camera*

[3:10:39] <Garthunox> Garthunox gifted a Tier 1 sub to Brother_Coduss! This is their first Gift Sub in the channel! 
[3:10:40] <Garthunox> Garthunox's Gift shared rewards to 5 others in Chat!

[3:11:13] <DE777ON> the framerate is negative

[3:12:12] <Ianrazz> LUL
[3:12:15] <rosemon5001> those type of videos allways makes me want to see the specs of the video maker some have just trash tier rigs @PeachSaliva

[3:12:17] <Tooniearcade> King

[3:12:27] <+WhereIsWill> eldritch abomination
[3:12:27] <Dingalow> Those games aren't good in spite of the jank, they're good BECAUSE of it
[3:12:31] <DE777ON> honestly the game should be 480p locked
[3:12:32] <$RueOrin> But what does Zach think?
[3:12:32] <JunkyardCrow> Benjamin Button disease
[3:12:34] <$Sphincter_Spelunker> It'll run fine on the Switch Emu for sure
[3:12:38] <YakumoYomi> Deadly Premonition is a lot like Earth Defense Force: the jank and performance issues are "features"
[3:12:42] <$DesertPenguin> SHIEL
[3:12:43] <jellssssss20> Outlets are giving it 9’s or 1’s lmao it’s gonna be great
[3:12:43] <$DesertPenguin> D

[3:12:49] <+TheShal> Good job Shield

[3:38:01] <DatAsuna> It would be way worse if he was
[3:38:02] <TheGrimmHuntsman> Ghosts in DS1 only existed because their bodies were buried in a massive pile and nearly destroyed. I think.
[3:38:06] <greynob> PEDO SMASH
[3:38:06] <+Remery_> It can't quit
[3:38:09] <$CrowbarFacelift> Paige needs gamer fuel

[3:38:48] <RyuuAoi> @remery_ Basically
[3:38:50] <%linSP> ds2 adds extended lore that ds1 has repeated for thousands of years
[3:39:08] <+fattmike> i dont agree with this style of useful and polite advice. please bring back pats horrible direction
[3:39:17] <DandyMackeroos> Also the hallways aren’t spacious

[3:40:02] <glasgow_mick89> Or dude and dude, lady and lady PridePog
[3:40:04] <$DesertPenguin> DS2 is the only game with foot prints
[3:40:09] <$DesertPenguin> Why didn't they bring that back?
[3:40:10] <%SvenHolgersson> Maybe its a god that likes to make ghosts out of souls
[3:40:11] <$FluffiTamamo> Smush farts into the throne
[3:40:12] <+Chewygamer> wrong
[3:40:12] <BooitsDock> this room is NG to fight a boss
[3:40:12] <theloganbrand> if you get drowned the flame of life is snuffed out
[3:40:13] <$DesertPenguin> Is cool
[3:40:14] <%SvenHolgersson> A water god
[3:40:15] <TheGrimmHuntsman> The bodies are beyond destroyed I think.
[3:40:28] <dalmek> the Four Kings were like "We FourKing love ghosts m8"
[3:40:28] <DandyMackeroos> You never do swim in Dark Souls
[3:40:30] <+patriotrenegade> and by later we mean NG+

[3:40:32] <BrachyZoid> That's the saddest throne room in video games...
[3:40:36] <$DesertPenguin> on the right
[3:40:53] <+xeros720> i'd argue pat's couch is the saddest throne room in video games
[3:40:54] <+Bailey__gaming> keep talking to ghost 4 a vendor

[3:41:54] <$DesertPenguin> yup
[3:41:54] <%skm742> crush damage = very good against armored dudes
[3:41:56] <dalmek> yeah
[3:41:57] <2fcd_twitch> It's a debuff
[3:41:57] <%Lion_kun> she never blocks, she panic swings
[3:42:01] <%Th3SmartAlec> I'm impressed that the game is failing to kill Paige no matter how hard she tries to die
[3:42:01] <RLT917> jaboodyGasm

[3:46:57] <%SvenHolgersson> BECAUSE SAURON WAS FUCKING WATCHING
[3:46:58] <RyuuAoi> Progress was...made?
[3:47:01] <cosmicgoatee> amazing Kappa
[3:47:05] <NoHoldsBarredProductions> BECAUSE IT'S ABOUT THE JOURNEY GODDAMNIT
[3:47:07] <garbageheaphound> The Nazgul would have killed them
[3:47:09] <$Sphincter_Spelunker> Sauron would have sniped their shit
[3:47:10] <fruit_pie_the_magician> Because nazgul
[3:47:11] <DandyMackeroos> The Eagles were tired
[3:47:12] <%SvenHolgersson> YOU DUMB SHITS EVERY TIME WITH THESE FUCKING EAGLES
[3:47:13] <+Chewygamer> that feel when you realize the 3rd eagle was for smeagol FeelsBadMan
[3:47:16] <user_naim> DARKLURKER AWAITS!!!
[3:47:21] <Laecerelius> There's an explanation for _____ but it's long and boring is the truest statement ever.
[3:47:23] <%Th3SmartAlec> DIO
[3:47:23] <@BigNaturalMan59> ffxi when
[3:47:24] <garbageheaphound> THE FUCKING NAZGUL DUDE
[3:47:26] <$Sphincter_Spelunker> because Stand users attracted one another
[3:47:26] <+demon1103> the reason is the Eagles are pricks who can't be bothered
[3:47:28] <ingvarbergman> the whole point of frodo carrying it is that they had to sneak it into mordor
[3:47:28] <tau_psi_pi> fell beasts, the ring is evil, archers
[3:47:28] <+chase959> they would have been tempted absolutely
[3:47:29] <user_naim> D A R K L U R K E R
[3:47:31] <$DesertPenguin> @PeachSaliva @PatStaresAt Take care of the life stuff you need to take care of. Take a nap. Come back later. See you at 10pm EST :)
[3:47:32] <+JenovasPuppet> It finds a way back, probably
[3:47:33] <+marsantas> It would EVENTUALLY get back
[3:47:33] <%Th3SmartAlec> A WHALE WOULD EAT IT
[3:47:35] <Dragovus> MORDOR HAS DRAGONS, THEY WOULD KILL THE EAGLES!
[3:47:37] <MSN04_Sazabi> Sauron was going to win without the ring anyway Pat
[3:47:37] <+gespenst25> Sauron was still going to take over the world without the ring
[3:47:39] <cosmicgoatee> no its a lore of middle earth reason yeah Plagues right
[3:47:39] <greynob> on the edge of the earth
[3:47:40] <Dr_Mooose> evil magic
[3:47:42] <Camail> he's a god, he'll find it
[3:47:43] <$Mopopolis> aint no suba suits in Middle earth!
[3:47:44] <Dingalow> It doesn't destroy the ring tho
[3:47:45] <+xeros720> Dio worked very hard with his teeth to move the rocks out
[3:47:45] <InvisibleMan101> a fish would eat the box and bring it back to shore
[3:47:46] <+LouieRouie> The nazgul could get it
[3:47:48] <DianaTheAscian> nemo will take it back
[3:47:49] <heartlesshealer> Can Sauron make zombies? Zombies don't need air
[3:47:49] <+JenovasPuppet> The ocean would become invisibl
[3:47:49] <$Mopopolis> Scuba*
[3:47:50] <DandyMackeroos> The Ring would leave
[3:47:50] <+CptCreampuff16> ocean is already evi;
[3:47:51] <+chase959> the Soran would be alive still
[3:47:52] <+BigCoffee> yeah but sauron can kill everything by then
[3:47:52] <Herb_guy> The ocean is already evil
[3:47:53] <+marsantas> A Long time while SATAN WALKS THE EARTH
[3:47:53] <TheArrow_> an evil ocean is not a problem we need
[3:47:55] <Joustar_> the krakken would eat it and spit it on the shore.
[3:47:56] <%Th3SmartAlec> LUL
[3:47:56] <maglebeast> If he has evil bats OF WAR, Sauron probably has evil fish... OF WAR!
[3:47:57] <+Ultimate_Edge> A swordfish catches it and the nazguls nosedive for it
[3:47:58] <fruit_pie_the_magician> Because Sauron gradually gets powerful again even without the ring
[3:47:58] <laserbeaming> That doesn't solve the Hordes of Orcs, Pat
[3:47:59] <BallerSwagBro9k> IVE SAID THE SAME THING
[3:48:00] <cardboardboots> evil fish people
[3:48:02] <Crimpson> Exactly. Destroying it destroyed him
