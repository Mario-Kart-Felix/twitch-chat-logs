[0:02:06] <jo_vo> Peach is sponsored by Mustard, not a brand, just the sauce itself.
[0:02:08] <Fien111> @gigacanuck Yeah but you also get summers that hit upper 90s every day with 100% humidity and a complete lack of non-service/governmental industry jobs, so we got that going against us too
[0:02:09] <+Erdrick117> okay guys, I haven't been around for a while, but did she ever get her eye exam done?
[0:02:11] <Zedimonx5> Brought to live from a Castle de Pat

[1:03:19] <paranormalpervert> RE ass camera angles
[1:03:21] <professormorrigan> The acting direction is very off in this game. Very different from Until Dawn.

[1:03:22] <DaBigVitus> uncanny valley as fuck
[1:03:23] <+Bluemanzee> China made my ship haunted

[1:04:04] <Nazgul240> @corporate_redeemer it feels like it should just be a terrible horror flick and not a game at all
[1:04:05] <professormorrigan> Was Until Dawn a fluke or something
[1:04:08] <bleugh> it's the drunk curse

[1:05:00] <GarbageQueenEllie> What do we do with a drunken sailor?
[1:05:00] <%ShichiNoBushi> It's so awkward how characters in these games turn pages over and hold their hands like that without readjusting their position.
[1:05:03] <dabeaminator> Until Dawn had Sony money, and this apparently doesn't. It shows.

[1:17:56] <ChamoCamouflage> Medan's an Indonesian city. Quick googling reveals that this is related to S.S. Ouran Medan, which was a apparently a lost ship who was later found filled with dead corpses.

[1:19:40] <+bubblebasspickles> pee is stored in the testicles :)
[1:19:40] <+trnzero> @PeachSaliva there is an option to replace button mashing with button holding if you need it
[1:19:40] <Mythundare> It's weird when a video game explains cause and effect in the opening.
[1:19:41] <+miguelrod777> PEE COMES FROM THE BALLS
[1:19:41] <+CJett92> F
[1:19:42] <paranormalpervert> she's gonna play as thatguywiththeglasses
[1:19:43] <DaBigVitus> drain the red bull sack
[1:19:43] <%AncelDeLambert> Paige keeps saying my name and it's weirding me out
[1:19:43] <Laecerelius> Pat has to let out the piss gas that's in his balls
[1:19:43] <+Pendragwn> @PeachSaliva if the balls are where pee is stored then where is your pee stored
[1:19:47] <%ShichiNoBushi> Balls swolen with pee.
[1:19:47] <%FailureTwoComply> Oh no, what an unfortunate time to be a toilet

[1:19:52] <%DandyMackeroos> Because pee is stored in the balls
[1:19:54] <JoeStillLife> in the balls
[1:19:56] <simulationbard> I was worried when I saw that the notification was a hour ago but then I remembered this was a Paige stream
[1:19:56] <suikudo> DUH
[1:19:56] <ralzonfleur> Are you feeling better Paige
[1:19:57] <GarbageQueenEllie> Ewwwwww

[1:20:02] <Jetsfantasy> I would've said the ovaries
[1:20:02] <dredgyboi> you must have a lot of pee
[1:20:03] <+conradical> female balls
[1:20:03] <+Deano8817> does that mean we drank piss as babies?
[1:20:04] <swipperswapper> women have internal nalls
[1:20:04] <rubbishbinge> the f. balls
[1:20:05] <gigacanuck> EEEUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUGH
[1:20:06] <NyotaKage> Does that mean the piss comes out of the nips
[1:20:06] <%ShichiNoBushi> That's where the malk comes from, though.
[1:20:06] <SomersaultJustice> can't fault that logic
[1:20:07] <GalaxyGirlChel> oh god no
[1:20:08] <KingKZ> Babies drink piss?
[1:20:09] <+YoguKinrei> I played a demo of this at SDCC, I was completely stonefaced the whole time. I was in agony.

[1:20:15] <+YumoNikki> Like Until Dawn, this game is really on the nose with whole "decisions matter" thing...
[1:20:17] <$renegadehatter> So when you're pregnant you pee milk?
[1:20:17] <paranormalpervert> then breastfeeding means you feed your baby piss?
[1:20:18] <%cureneckbeard> piss bag
[1:20:18] <VanLynx> Her pee is ALSO stored in Pat's Balls
[1:20:20] <+ThatOneGameTester> heard that toilet seat
[1:20:20] <Scharfster> That makes it sound like he's JOing
[1:20:21] <%rumtumtugnutz> Why do you hate Joe Paige
[1:20:21] <gigacanuck> why did this meme even start

[2:43:06] <%darthrevan4ever> what in the world is going on
[2:43:06] <%JenovasPuppet> Followers-only is always fine. Subscribers only is where you get in trouble.
[2:43:08] <%lewdskeletor13> It’s fine really
[2:43:08] <+SpoonlessAlakazam> Literally a single click of a button
[2:43:11] <+jerree66> followers fine

[2:43:13] <%lewdskeletor13> Only idiots will complain
[2:43:14] <Louie_Salmon> Followers only is like the best mode, it only keeps out dummy accounts and people that don't like you
[2:43:17] <Prevot> gggggghosts?
[2:43:20] <%zamatermort> spoooooky ghooooosts
[2:43:22] <+CJett92> Chat is a shit, so this is cool

[2:43:43] <Megaleg> you know she's the smart one because she believes in ghosts
[2:43:44] <%jou_star> it IS absurd
[2:43:45] <%Estuko> @freightl0rd subs being superior isn't realy fitting the role, might as well call themselves a dom
[2:43:46] <%InnocentAce> Ghost ships are a thing pat.
[2:43:48] <%supersugoisenpai1> supersugoisenpai1 subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 15 months! This game is pretty spooky. I think it needs some Scooby Doo music and sound effects edited in.

[2:43:48] <Nazgul240> @louie_salmon it also keeps out new viewers
[2:43:50] <%Teintstein> ya, follows only chat is no biggie
[2:43:51] <+SpoonlessAlakazam> Sub only is only necessary for massive spam issues, or absent mods.

[2:46:02] <%Mister_McDerp> Medan is a city on sumatra
[2:46:06] <professormorrigan> Conrad will miss the ghosts :(
[2:46:08] <AmericanaRed> BibleThump
[2:46:11] <tigerfang86> NO plan
[2:46:11] <Tressing> passive-agressive much?
[2:46:13] <derap41> Pirates usually don't

[2:46:19] <MarylandJutsu> BABBYYY

[2:46:21] <+Takreth> Conrad threw money and ran
[2:46:22] <alexandrecau> never fouille the soute
[2:46:22] <Dragon_Batman> There is a very deliberate pause between controller hand offs
[2:46:23] <dabeaminator> They're frantically looking for the script
[2:46:25] <dukenux> M-MUNEY
[2:46:28] <Sol_Install> their plan was: take hostage, get money
[2:46:28] <InugamiTheHound> apatGib xcalLove
[2:46:31] <adamisfruit> At times like these I always think of how great it is that CONRAD is safe. He was the best of them.
[2:46:31] <bleugh> PogChamp muny
[2:46:32] <AFlyingTaco1> Pirates aren't always the smartest folk, let's be honest here.
[2:46:36] <LORDSPOOKLEKINS> JUNIOR IS COOL
[2:46:37] <GarbageQueenEllie> Conrad comes back with his parents' personal naval army like a boss
[2:46:38] <Sol_Install> Now: The fuck we do now!?
[2:46:38] <+Shadicara> Reason with the nice one and kill everyone
[2:46:41] <Nazgul240> @luesagna00 yeah, it's hot seat mode or purely online
[2:46:41] <%Remery_> Conrad is jerking off in a hotel right now
[2:46:42] <Monkeyweed21> This was supposed to be a mugging
[2:46:43] <+allups> yeah showing off ur rich makes people that usually dont crime do the crime
[2:46:43] <Jetsfantasy> 5 bucks says Conrad is already drinking
[2:46:46] <%DesuDesuDokiDoki> idk this seems dumb
[2:46:47] <forgetme000> Is pat trying to kill off characters he dosent like lol
[2:46:47] <+SpoonlessAlakazam> I wonder if Junior might switch sides here.
[2:46:48] <King_Wolf_Rigger> Junior is a rapey fuck
[2:46:52] <+doc_ock_rokc> Its likely conrad is lost as fuck and driving out into the open water

[3:06:47] <%Sphincter_Spelunker> Friday 13th monkaS
[3:06:48] <%ShichiNoBushi> Paige needs to play a Fatal Frame game.
[3:06:52] <%JenovasPuppet> Just remember, if anyone dies we will call you out on it for years (but we will do it with love)
[3:06:55] <@MelBrooksKA> Wha
[3:06:56] <$Punisher7771> sober in the navy that sucks
[3:06:56] <Dementedpenguin> this better be one of those "the fake scare before the real one"or I'm disappointed.
[3:06:56] <+axebird> Until Dawn was cool, so far this is pretty Cage tier
[3:06:59] <simulationbard> DIO
[3:07:00] <Tressing> Why did all paper things survive..?
[3:07:02] <dukenux> MonkaS
[3:07:05] <Aceofhearts87> Remember peach not all shines are good things so be careful what shiny you go for
[3:07:07] <Y2Jsan> YES to Paige playing Fatal Frame
[3:07:08] <GarbageQueenEllie> I also dislike the cheap jumpscares. Give me something to creep me out, dammit!
[3:07:10] <+thejimjamz> I'm not convinced Alex can actually read- he might just be making all this up in his head
[3:07:12] <swipperswapper> precise for the rituals
[3:07:15] <%jou_star> Weaponized. Ghosts.
[3:07:15] <SunnyD_Solaire> Dio?
[3:07:16] <dukenux> muffled wryyyyyyyyyy
[3:07:17] <+MrHaru> Like it’s so bad you may mistake it for how Modern movies are nowadays.
[3:07:19] <%Faustgesicht> your link made miss the scare
[3:07:20] <%Mister_McDerp> VAMPIRES
[3:07:21] <TurtlesAndTentacles> DIO
[3:07:21] <@Calek> @Tressing why did a ship just resurface
[3:07:21] <otakon17> what's in the box?! What's in the BOX!?
[3:07:25] <%Faustgesicht> curses
[3:07:26] <+SpoonlessAlakazam> I'm just as affected by jump scares as anyone else, but these seem pretty impotent hobbW
[3:07:26] <+CarlosEoM> distant wryyyyyy
[3:07:26] <patismyhero> Fartnocka is that you.
[3:07:27] <+ThatOneGameTester> that's totally on purpose, the date
[3:07:28] <$wolfofsound> good ole hooch
[3:07:29] <$Solidnick18> oh
[3:07:29] <+pseudograe> gmartStand gmartStand gmartStand
[3:07:33] <Tressing> fair enough
[3:07:35] <JoeStillLife> People hate jump scares because they get scared Kappa
[3:07:35] <%Estuko> @GarbageQueenEllie I love the background "DID YOU SEE THAT SHIT" kinda scares, not the loud sound and in my face kinda stuff.
[3:07:36] <GalaxyGirlChel> @SunnyD_Solaire its always DIO
[3:07:36] <Dhurkst> @axebird At least cage games have cool concepts, this is cliche as hell
[3:07:37] <@MelBrooksKA> @Calek Fuckin' ghosts
[3:07:40] <tigerfang86> then he DIED
[3:07:44] <%ShichiNoBushi> Made alcohol from some of the sarcophagus juice.
[3:07:44] <$Solidnick18> hmmm
[3:07:45] <%waltzqueen> THANKS FOR EXTRA CURSE
[3:07:45] <otakon17> and then he was never heard from again!
[3:07:46] <tigerfang86> BIG DIED
[3:07:48] <+Engwithan_Elder_God> So, he's the one who got everyone killed.
[3:07:48] <%DesuDesuDokiDoki> LUL
[3:07:56] <+Reizie_Etherealm> If they really want to scare they should stop surprising and make each trigger more creepy
[3:07:58] <+Ascethetic> it could even be a boat!
[3:07:59] <dukenux> WHATSINTHEBOOOOX
[3:08:00] <qaaj> Tetsuya Nomura's nonexistent plans for KH are in the box
[3:08:01] <%Kenzo2000> chug
[3:08:02] <$wolfofsound> eh I'd have probably done the same
[3:08:02] <otakon17> Should have just returned the slab
[3:08:04] <grayjammer> Cherry Pie
[3:08:06] <%deviljhojho94> D:

[3:08:19] <MissMalisin> PogChamp
[3:08:19] <nootsandbooter> suprised this game has lootboxes ;)
[3:08:19] <waifoong98> de javu!
[3:08:20] <AFlyingTaco1> Oh so that's a possible Alex death
[3:08:20] <otakon17> What was THAT !?
[3:08:20] <+Takreth> LOL
[3:08:21] <$SvenHolgersson> CONRAD!
[3:08:21] <Graxe_> Wait, there are premonitions?
[3:08:22] <%Sphincter_Spelunker> It said possible visions
[3:08:22] <dukenux> LUL
[3:08:22] <SunnyD_Solaire> spoilers!
[3:08:23] <%Estuko> So this event might be avoided ??
[3:08:24] <SpaceGuntank> bonk
[3:08:24] <JumbleJams> maybe timelines?
[3:08:25] <%DesuDesuDokiDoki> so it cant happen
[3:08:28] <professormorrigan> Didn't make alternate versions for no Conrad Kappa
[3:08:28] <$Draylle> is conrad a zombie now?
[3:08:31] <tigerfang86> maybe you're safe on this timeline
[3:08:31] <GarbageQueenEllie> Conrad prolly won't be there
[3:08:33] <+LuchaDePucha> and having the others locked out
[3:08:34] <%Valdorick> It might mean it can only happen if Canrad is there.
[3:08:35] <dukenux> do ot sgain
[3:08:35] <Dr_Mooose> be wary of dying
[3:08:35] <King_Wolf_Rigger> Looks like Junior, the one-eyed rapey freak
[3:08:36] <GyroBrando> Its because he coud be there
[3:08:37] <CptBritches> Conrad isn't coming back clearly
[3:08:37] <@Calek> bwhaaaaaa
[3:08:37] <%FloorBurger> dont do it
[3:08:39] <$Solidnick18> huh
[3:08:46] <AFlyingTaco1> No way, he's a variable
[3:08:47] <gyro_gogo_zeppeli> no
[3:08:48] <%DesuDesuDokiDoki> no\
[3:08:48] <Lunatyr_> nah
[3:08:48] <%JenovasPuppet> I feel like it's just going to be the exact same thing but without Conrad.
[3:08:49] <adamisfruit> Weaponized cursed coffins?!? Like catapulting plague corpses over city walls?!?
[3:08:50] <$Punisher7771> wait what was that jeepers ceepers head lockin ass
[3:08:50] <%galveria> No
[3:08:52] <Dame_90> Conrad might not be there when he said fuck y'all
[3:08:52] <RadSuit> This seems fun to play, but it's nowhere near as fun to watch and follow the story as Until Dawn was. Like, ghost ship zombies, cool, I guess? The whole triple-cross thing in UD was way more compelling. So I guess unless aliens show up or it was all a trick...
[3:08:53] <+Klienart> i think thats olson @King_Wolf_Rigger
[3:08:54] <%ShichiNoBushi> Maybe Conrad found the ship, too.
[3:08:56] <%Faustgesicht> death of Alex if conrad's there, i'm guessing
[3:08:58] <+TheImmortal70> THAT exact situation won't happen but a similar version of it might since Conrad is gone
[3:08:59] <Dragon_Batman> They are seperated and it looked like the guy might have been infected or something
[3:08:59] <simulationbard> The box has embarrassing picture of Sopngebob at the Christmas party in it
[3:09:02] <+SpoonlessAlakazam> @King_Wolf_Rigger Junior has the headband, Olson has the one eye
[3:09:04] <+fingalights> Conrad is the ship
[3:09:06] <%Sphincter_Spelunker> @King_Wolf_Rigger Junior wwas the cool one who gave us a flashlight. Olsen was the one eyed freak
[3:09:11] <+nekomancerer> did she teleport?
[3:09:13] <+ThatOneGameTester> Yeah, it may have been good you got dick bag conrad out of there, he would have pissed the ghosts off with his very essence
[3:09:13] <HuggsM> Hey guys, just joined. Thinking of getting this game for me and my friend to play tonight but, is couch co-op available? Or is it just all online?
[3:09:14] <%DesuDesuDokiDoki> crazy talk
[3:09:18] <Scharfster> Oh wow that's not stream stutter?
[3:09:20] <patismyhero> The box named big Porn. Holds all the mysteries.
[3:09:21] <GalaxyGirlChel> Conrad is the stand user of the ship
[3:09:22] <SunnyD_Solaire> baba doesnt like that
[3:09:22] <+ThatOneGameTester> probably
[3:09:23] <+Klienart> where the heck did brad go
[3:09:24] <+CJett92> @RadSuit Ya, the whole story just isnt anywhere near as interesting either
[3:09:25] <waifoong98> is this Kenny's boat Kappa
[3:09:26] <%audrus> baba doesnt like that
[3:09:26] <otakon17> So this isbasically a simulated spook house?
[3:09:29] <@Calek> @HuggsM couch co op is available but it's passing a controller
[3:09:30] <%Kenzo2000> OIC
[3:09:31] <Nazgul240> A twist or Dev's to lazy to account for all scenario?
[3:09:32] <RadSuit> @CJett92 Disappointing...

[4:18:07] <tigerfang86> Alex
[4:18:07] <$SvenHolgersson> rip
[4:18:07] <%Kenzo2000> lol no it doesn't
[4:18:07] <%Ell1ot> isn't there a radio on their ship?
[4:18:08] <suikudo> from the fucking 40s?
[4:18:08] <otakon17> Dude
[4:18:08] <+SergeantSov> Bitch its a GHOST SHIP
[4:18:08] <DjFrostBite95> monkaS oh no
[4:18:09] <+Piemen99> no
[4:18:09] <SailingSaturn> I think its a byproduct of it being Multiple Ending game guys cirISee
[4:18:10] <ursusbearrammage> I wish more games would use the la noir face animation style instead of this lifeless style
[4:18:10] <Zaphire_Saucypants> the electricity works somehow
[4:18:11] <+Engwithan_Elder_God> You'd think the radio would work 70 years later?
[4:18:11] <+LuchaDePucha> alex why
[4:18:11] <eco419> all dialogues feels weird
[4:18:11] <transporterthesequel> It super does NOT WORK
[4:18:12] <LixFury> WHY ARE THE LIGHTS ON
[4:18:13] <tigerfang86> Alex NO
[4:18:13] <rytisone> the radio's out
[4:18:13] <otakon17> it's over 50 years old!
[4:18:13] <+Revenantreaver> THATS A GUN
[4:18:14] <MetalSlimeHunt> They look like they were scared to death because they seized up and died.
[4:18:14] <+CaptainGrime> @Novillion do they look like professors to you lol ?
[4:18:15] <Ion_Laser> NO ALEX
[4:18:15] <+Niney_Who> Where's Conrad FeelsBadMan
[4:18:16] <Louie_Salmon> They literally said it doesn't work
[4:18:17] <%linSP> BIG brain
[4:18:18] <rhus> we KNOW it doesn't?
[4:18:18] <Tophat12> Maybe the dialogue changes based on the stuff you find?
[4:18:20] <+timblenaut> Duke's radio should work
[4:18:20] <waifoong98> expecting the army to go looking for a ghost ship LUL
[4:18:21] <swipperswapper> ham radios are real good guys its not dumb
[4:18:21] <derap41> Dying of gas exposure while tripping on balls counts as dying of "fright"
[4:18:22] <tigerfang86> BIG BRAIN ALEX
[4:18:22] <+Shadicara> back into the insane gas
[4:18:22] <EASrake> Boat probably needs to be turned on
[4:18:23] <$ESP_ROOT> PAIGE YOUR TURN
[4:18:23] <%Mister_McDerp> the lights on?
[4:18:24] <Laecerelius> That wouldn't work, would it? I mean there's got to be no electricity on this ship anymore
[4:18:25] <Dr_Mooose> back at it Paige
[4:18:25] <%Dutchpotato> we already know it doesn't work
[4:18:25] <ryderbootz> a big gun in the pale moon light
[4:18:26] <%Sphincter_Spelunker> Conrad the hero
[4:18:26] <%SirGO0SE> pat play alex
[4:18:27] <jay521> Double paige
[4:18:27] <danknugglit> GHOST POWER
[4:18:27] <+ScantronTheImmortal> must have been a bio weapon gas leak lols
[4:18:31] <+vaporousTippler> Courage popcorn.
[4:18:31] <PatchySouls> @ursusbearrammage you know that's expensive, right?
[4:18:31] <ospreyworks> They hallucinated themselves into heart attacks
[4:18:31] <SulfurousAcid> Galaxy Brain Alex
[4:18:31] <GalaxyGirlChel> super big brain
[4:18:32] <Jetsfantasy> Dr Alex
[4:18:33] <%Gogogolem> @PeachSaliva Distrubitor cap means no electfic nothign
[4:18:33] <King_Wolf_Rigger> The Duke's radio would dtill work
[4:18:34] <Dame_90> Not boat expert NotLikeThis
[4:18:35] <otakon17> Boats get electricity from the running engine usually so yeah without the engine, no electricity
[4:18:40] <%Faustgesicht> Where did the crew go? Where did the corpses come from? I'M SO CONFUSED
[4:18:41] <transporterthesequel> Like Brad literally knows it doesn't
[4:18:41] <@MelBrooksKA> It's a 50 year old ACID LEAD BATTERY RADIO
[4:18:43] <%alex_id> the radio should work regardless of the engine
[4:18:44] <+darudeampersandstorm> alex is big dummy
[4:18:44] <King_Wolf_Rigger> @Gogogolem Not true
[4:18:45] <%audrus> the dumb bitch juice is leaking all over this ship
[4:18:45] <%salty_syd913> im gonna dip see ya paig
[4:18:47] <nevan0> i love that u call him dumb alex
[4:18:54] <+Engwithan_Elder_God> The fucking radios weren't consistent in the 40s. 70 years later and it'll be fine...sure.
[4:18:57] <paranormalpervert> awww yeah time to use the literal 60 plus year old tech on the rust boat in the middle of nowhere
[4:19:06] <GarbageQueenEllie> that sounds like a major design flaw
[4:19:09] <$wolfofsound> sounds like a bad design
[4:19:09] <+ComradePenguin> except they have a battery...
[4:19:12] <JoeStillLife> totally
[4:19:12] <+Takreth> NERD
[4:19:13] <Ner234> effed
[4:19:13] <RunningNGunning> D:
[4:19:14] <@Calek> @MelBrooksKA sooo... it works?
[4:19:14] <+ComradePenguin> several on large boats
[4:19:14] <VJdarkworld> effed D:
[4:19:16] <King_Wolf_Rigger> Distributor is not the alternator, it's only for the spark plugs
[4:19:17] <%BubbaRands> effed in the ayyy
[4:19:17] <$ESP_ROOT> effed bro 4Head
[4:19:18] <%Kenzo2000> what the eff man
[4:19:18] <Jetsfantasy> So manchurian gold runs the engine on this ship?
[4:19:19] <@Calek> I'm gonna say it works just fine
[4:19:19] <+MaddyCaddy> If they eat the battery liquid, it will be okay
[4:19:20] <Meekest> Not necessarily
[4:19:21] <+Shadicara> No he's stupid
[4:19:21] <DjFrostBite95> Yes
[4:19:21] <transporterthesequel> Possibly!
[4:19:22] <%kiiiirsten> This is "let's use the radio in that old ranger tower"
[4:19:22] <worldbrand> a med student would, but not him
[4:19:23] <+Revenantreaver> Not necessarily
[4:19:23] <derap41> extreme brain damage
[4:19:23] <Jakracer> the lights are still on
[4:19:24] <%romanticzomedy> alex is not a smart man
[4:19:26] <$Piemono> Med students don't trip enough balls
[4:19:26] <Dr_Mooose> maybe he is a bad student
[4:19:27] <+Chronobot> they never said he was a GOOD med student
[4:19:27] <paranormalpervert> the wonders of american technology
[4:19:28] <diglettdong> god somehow brad's dialogue is the worst
[4:19:28] <otakon17> Not if it's unknown
[4:19:28] <%SirGO0SE> yeah but he hasnt passed med school yet
[4:19:29] <%TUMZfestival> no shutup
[4:19:30] <%romanticzomedy> Alex has to be Plot Stupid
[4:19:30] <+YumoNikki> Ryuji?! Is that you?!
[4:19:30] <AFlyingTaco1> No shut up Pat that would be smart
[4:19:31] <nevan0> totally effed dawg
[4:19:31] <+twohitgood> not if your med student is dumb alex
[4:19:31] <Louie_Salmon> I dunno, this is pretty unprecedented
[4:19:32] <+fingalights> He's a doctor not a chemist
[4:19:32] <SailingSaturn> He's only been in Med School in 2 weeks LUL
[4:19:33] <+Revenantreaver> Hell no too rusted
[4:19:33] <+ScantronTheImmortal> yeah engines recharge everything electrical on a boat same with old fashioned submarines and their batteries
[4:19:34] <%Sphincter_Spelunker> WWCD What would Conrad do? 🤔
[4:19:34] <transporterthesequel> Sure was!
[4:19:35] <%Mister_McDerp> he big dumb
[4:19:35] <%kiiiirsten> STOP PICKING UP BULLETS!!!
[4:19:35] <%audrus> NOT IF HE'S ALSO GETTING MENTALLY IMPAIRED FROM THAT SAME GAS
[4:19:37] <derap41> Its like they're huffing gasoline
[4:19:38] <+HelveticaScenario> Wasn't the radio determined to not work in that note?
[4:19:39] <Laecerelius> Not if it's a special secret government BIO WEAPON
[4:19:39] <RupanSen> he's a student not a luminaire
[4:19:40] <@MelBrooksKA> @Calek What do you know about acid spyCappa
[4:19:40] <GalaxyGirlChel> even if you use said "radio" how the fuck could you trust a voice on the other side given what is going on?
[4:19:44] <+Engwithan_Elder_God> Upstairs Hollywood Medical School Alex.
[4:19:45] <eco419> SO DED
[4:19:45] <rytisone> It was a dragon
[4:19:45] <scrumbotime> .... Maybe it's a double set up, you THINK it's chemicals, but its really ACTUALLY ghosts
[4:19:46] <Dame_90> Not a very good med student
[4:19:47] <tigerfang86> the DEMUNS
[4:19:49] <swipperswapper> shutup the writing is tots mcgoats good
[4:19:50] <%Mister_McDerp> sky demons
[4:19:51] <GarbageQueenEllie> They were aiming for Caim and Angelus
[4:19:51] <+floralkami> He hasn't tripped enough in med school yet
[4:19:53] <%romanticzomedy> It's ghost WITH chemicals
[4:19:55] <Tressing> Just two weeks and he`s stressed:::??!!
[4:19:55] <ZE_Count> ALIENS PAT! I mean we have done that before.
[4:19:56] <leargo> they shot theyr rescuers cool
[4:19:57] <@Calek> @MelBrooksKA Xenomorphs have it for blood
[4:19:58] <danknugglit> Luckily this boat has ghost power
[4:19:59] <otakon17> I bet killed
[4:20:00] <+TheImmortal70> I would vote for killed probably
[4:20:02] <hntronium> Ghost Chemicals?
[4:20:03] <%TUMZfestival> @MelBrooksKA I wish my guy would hurry up...
[4:20:03] <Dragon_Batman> Some of them did die from gun shot so hallucinations abound
[4:20:07] <%bluetocho13> or dragons
[4:20:08] <+Revenantreaver> Oooh that boat is not the best looking
[4:20:10] <+blue_twitch> maybe this sounds crazy but i grabbed a bullet earlier and it turned into leeches and then there were leeches all over me, mondays right
[4:20:12] <Prevot> so how did this ship go unnoticed for so long if it's not even sunk
[4:20:12] <+darudeampersandstorm> this is the dumbest team I've ever seen in a game
[4:20:13] <Scharfster> texture lol
[4:20:15] <+Andrizzleton> lifeboat's texture is kill
[4:20:15] <MarylandJutsu> hey EMLo
[4:20:15] <+VietcongSamurai> Oof that texture.
[4:20:16] <+LuchaDePucha> we can always hope that conrad comes back with help lol
[4:20:16] <star_feline> <3 CoolCat
[4:20:17] <%whgs> sipsipHellmo
[4:20:19] <%kiiiirsten> No escape no surrender
[4:20:19] <otakon17> I hear that Elmo he's lovely
[4:20:19] <ospreyworks> So, the whole thing is chemical hallucinations, but because this is Until Dawn 2, there will be something supernatural.
[4:20:22] <+IronPickle> Maybe Alex is lying about being a medical student
[4:20:22] <%audrus> big fresh
[4:20:23] <Dhurkst> SQUEEKEE
[4:20:25] <%RainDelayTheater> Ghosts/Chemicals.
[4:20:25] <%jou_star> ps1 game right there
[4:20:28] <$ESP_ROOT> moon2E

[4:20:32] <paranormalpervert> there is no such thing as magic or the supernatural... only cutting edge technology
[4:20:33] <JumbleJams> biocurse
[4:20:34] <GalaxyGirlChel> Especially fliss

[4:20:36] <MarylandJutsu> HE SCREM
[4:20:36] <EASrake> Yeah there's still a lich on the boat
[4:20:37] <Scharfster> @ospreyworks that's what i'm thinking lol
[4:20:37] <RunningNGunning> ??????
[4:20:37] <+Shadicara> Because they're sniffing crack gas
[4:20:38] <gravitydazequeen> it's almost as if you should stay up top
[4:20:38] <+Revenantreaver> They need to do that thing from face off
[4:20:39] <%Kenzo2000> Yeah no one crazy has ever sung a song

[4:20:49] <danknugglit> THAT WONT MAKE THEM CRAZY
[4:20:49] <%kiiiirsten> Paige what in the ding dang fuck
[4:20:49] <+twohitgood> that's a horrible idea
[4:20:50] <GarbageQueenEllie> "Let me smell yo diiiick"
[4:20:51] <%Dutchpotato> but then the hallucinations would know as weell?
[4:20:51] <Zaphire_Saucypants> that and a hallucination would trick you into hearing it
[4:20:52] <+starkandstag> apatBlep apatBlep apatBlep apatBlep
[4:20:52] <%Mister_McDerp> what if they hallucinate the song?
[4:20:52] <CptBritches> What in the shit are you on about?
[4:20:53] <%Ell1ot> they can sing baby shark over and over
[4:20:53] <+LuchaDePucha> emlo wants attention
[4:20:54] <Dame_90> Easy Street
[4:20:54] <otakon17> Elmo sings the song of his people
[4:20:55] <$ESP_ROOT> i dont want to be annoyed
[4:20:55] <diglettdong> paige what is that plan
[4:20:56] <AFlyingTaco1> Paige are you high on ghost fart gas now?
[4:20:56] <+Shacklebox> and attracting the thuggery?
[4:20:56] <+nekodelic> Pige is right tho
[4:20:57] <Zaktheaussie> why not a codeword paig?
[4:20:59] <%whgs> sipsipElmo
[4:21:00] <Monkeyweed21> doesnt work with auditory hallucinations
[4:21:00] <+Rafferty3231> hahahahha sing a song
[4:21:02] <+MisterTylerrr> I can't wait for the monkey to show up and reveal that the boat is a stand
[4:21:02] <+twohitgood> you get terrified and stop singing then you're dead
[4:21:02] <%garagon31> sign countersign would be just as effective as singing a spooky song
[4:21:03] <%TUMZfestival> Acid is lowkey miraculous feeling if you have constant anxiety and shit (IMO) I mean ... A friend
[4:21:04] <MadDesperado13> you hear things so would'nt work
[4:21:06] <%FrostedZaibatsu> Or spin a top like inception
[4:21:07] <rytisone> sing twinkle twinkle little star
[4:21:07] <fazoburquina> question: how real is for an old ship to just keep afloat and drifting about for decades and no one finding it?
[4:21:09] <+YumoNikki> DA BABY apatWink
[4:21:09] <MarylandJutsu> Emlo NO LIKE DUMB ALEX
[4:21:10] <ospreyworks> Dude if this becomes Cthulu monsters like how the last game became Wendigos, I will lose my mind.
[4:21:11] <nevan0> elmo is babey
[4:21:13] <+CaptainGrime> go back
[4:21:14] <closetgremlin12> Either that or a crazy code word like Monkey Slut
[4:21:14] <GarbageQueenEllie> But wouldn't they just hallucinate them singing the song anyway?
[4:21:20] <hntronium> yo ho yo ho
[4:21:21] <PatchySouls> drugs are never cool
[4:21:23] <MetalSlimeHunt> @fazoburquina It's happened. Ocean is a big place
[4:21:25] <CurrySauseBandit> Assuming Manchurian gold isn't a common chemical people come across. Probably not symptoms most doctors would know. Who knows though.
[4:21:25] <star_feline> Elmo footage more captivating than this game
[4:21:26] <+Revenantreaver> @fazoburquina very possibly
[4:21:27] <leargo> Peach has good idea
[4:21:27] <Zaphire_Saucypants> gas mask
[4:21:28] <NeroInfinite> well shit

[4:23:07] <derap41> the rubber would have dried out and crumbled by now
[4:23:08] <countgaculatv> In irl scenario, by regulation you have 8-9 seconds to put on the masks with those instructions.
[4:23:09] <Huntercd> I hated clearing gas masks in the Marine Corps
[4:23:09] <AFlyingTaco1> ARE YOU SERIOUS ALEX
[4:23:11] <+SpoonlessAlakazam> Putting on an old ass gas mask with old ass filters is a reaaaally bad idea.
[4:23:17] <%InnocentAce> Those things have asbestos in the filters lol
[4:23:19] <%linSP> looks like the masks were issued because of a gas leak
[4:23:28] <AFlyingTaco1> Fliss LITERALLY JUST TOLD YOU what was onboard
[4:23:28] <+changdesu> @SpoonlessAlakazam 100% agree

[4:24:08] <AFlyingTaco1> No just cover your mouth and then the gas can't get you
[4:24:09] <%panic_rabbit> even if it wasn't toxic the rubber might well have degraded by now
[4:24:09] <paranormalpervert> now shut up and find the 75 year old radio
[4:24:10] <+twohitgood> maybe worse because you'd think it wasn't literally nothing.
[4:24:13] <otakon17> >is this how Paige got the Lupus

[4:25:18] <missingangle> Well, he could lift them up easier, too
[4:25:18] <+Deano8817> actually, lifting the strong guy up makes sense
[4:25:18] <countgaculatv> Big guy can pick them all up
[4:25:19] <%jou_star> no that's smart
[4:25:21] <Louie_Salmon> Doesn't that totally make sense?
[4:25:21] <%Typhaeon> He has more upper body strength to pull the rest up
[4:25:22] <SovPho> Imagine lifting a guy up with your legs, and then imagine pulling a guy up with your arms
[4:25:22] <hntronium> [THAT'S WRONG PAT]
[4:25:24] <ospreyworks> Easier for her to lift that way than try to pull him up?
[4:25:24] <suikudo> fucking shit up
[4:25:24] <Dragon_Batman> The pull part would do good
[4:25:26] <+Andrizzleton> tetanus for sure
[4:25:27] <PatchySouls> dying LUL
[4:25:27] <+floralkami> Well, legs are stronger than arms

[4:25:30] <Gutsandlove> well that worked
[4:25:31] <%Gogogolem> jerking off in a corner

[4:25:32] <Dr_Mooose> he dipped
[4:25:32] <RupanSen> throw money

[4:25:39] <%TUMZfestival> FURIOUSLY
[4:25:40] <%Mister_McDerp> he got the fuck out
[4:25:41] <+CSNG> Probably would have died on the Duke
[4:25:42] <Jetsfantasy> Conrad would be jerkin' it to the ghosts' wife/gf photos
[4:25:42] <+Shadicara> Pat if we lifted you up there you'd leave us all for dead LUL
[4:25:44] <ospreyworks> my money's on conrad being dead
[4:25:44] <%kiiiirsten> "I hope those guys are okay"
[4:25:45] <Ion_Laser> Conrad would probably try to boink one of the hallucinations
[4:25:45] <$Chatterbox1991> Where is Junier btw?
[4:25:49] <%JJCheeker> I didn't see autism on there
[4:25:51] <InugamiTheHound> maxed out his S-links with Julia

[4:25:52] <GalaxyGirlChel> dont tell me hes still relaxed
[4:25:52] <Dragon_Batman> Yea that Marriage thing probably skyrocketed that shit
[4:25:53] <caol2017> conrad would be fucking dead
[4:25:54] <AFlyingTaco1> He'll show up at the very end with a rescue boat
[4:25:56] <missingangle> Hold on I just missed most of this stream, did someone already die?

[4:26:04] <%kiiiirsten> How the fuck would Conrad make it back to any land? Did he have any idea where they were? He didn't have water or anything in that boat
[4:26:05] <Reanimator83> Conrad is getting wasted in a club
[4:26:06] <+CaptainGrime> @PeachSaliva i misread one of those and thought it said autistic LUL
[4:26:07] <%ShichiNoBushi> Necromancer is actually friendly and volunteers to wed them.

[4:26:24] <+HelveticaScenario> @missingangle No one dead yet
[4:26:25] <+floralkami> @peachSaliva It would be better to have the person with the most upper body strength to lift the rest of the people up
[4:26:26] <%TUMZfestival> RUNNY ASS EWWW
[4:26:28] <%romanticzomedy> Friendly neighborhood Necromancer would be a good twist

[4:44:58] <Ion_Laser> FLOATING BIO WEAPON
[4:45:00] <+Sp3ctre48> I hope there actually is a ghost though
[4:45:00] <AFlyingTaco1> You just figured this out
[4:45:00] <Laironx3> A Bioweapon!?
[4:45:02] <scrumbotime> Remember NOTHING IS AS IT SEEMS

[4:45:12] <otakon17> some kind of chemical weapon
[4:45:15] <+twohitgood> the ship shot down the plane cause they were tripping balls
[4:45:16] <ospreyworks> The nerd solved it!!!
[4:45:16] <%Lion_kun> are they gonna go the whole way and beat the game?
[4:45:17] <+Revenantreaver> So they're dead now
[4:45:18] <+darudeampersandstorm> KNAWLEDGE
[4:45:18] <JumbleJams> but then who is warlock??
[4:45:19] <+jkobe34> so stay outside
[4:45:20] <LokimenD> The ULTIMATE bio weapon youd say
[4:45:20] <+cereal_box_conspiracy> Even if they live, they're all going to die of exotic cancers.
[4:45:21] <AFlyingTaco1> Even though Flissa tells you about the Manchurian Gold chemicals?
[4:45:21] <+CaptainGrime> YES BIG BRAINS
[4:45:22] <%king_wragles> bioCURSE GGGOOOOLLLDDD
[4:45:23] <+Engwithan_Elder_God> Now they must die.
[4:45:26] <forgetme000> Umbrella has been busy
[4:45:26] <Gutsandlove> LUL
[4:45:27] <transporterthesequel> Good thing the two that figured it out are gonna diiieeee
[4:45:28] <King_Wolf_Rigger> That knowledge REALLY fucking helps.
[4:45:29] <GarbageQueenEllie> And KNOWING is half the battle!
[4:45:30] <MicrotonalMatt> Predatory fart gas
[4:45:30] <SulfurousAcid> Diesel
[4:45:32] <+CSNG> Now there will be a twist that there IS actuallty ghosts
[4:45:34] <+Andrizzleton> Look at the big brain on Brad
[4:45:35] <+Shadicara> Too bad they're ass deep in the bio ship LUL
[4:45:35] <WaitHowDidIGetHere> Finally dropped the idiot ball!
[4:45:35] <+BLK_HRLQN_13> best high ever :3
[4:45:36] <RadSuit> I know a little something about Diesel.
[4:45:37] <%Lion_kun> COMPLETE GLOBAL....SATURATION
[4:45:37] <%Mister_McDerp> Dutch ship
[4:45:38] <Dragon_Batman> You have to make shure you remind them, cuz they will forget, I'm shure
[4:45:38] <RupanSen> but what if there's ALSO monstars
[4:45:42] <LoliKappa> the Dutch must be behind this!
[4:45:44] <gravitydazequeen> how did they know think of this before??
[4:45:44] <Aceofhearts87> Complete global saturation Kappa
[4:45:45] <King_Wolf_Rigger> I'm not being sarcastic either. It does.
[4:45:48] <InugamiTheHound> anyone from Netherlands here in chat?
[4:45:49] <%Kenzo2000> I ope the other haraters go the other way and get way into it being a curse
[4:45:49] <LokimenD> Now to wait for the other shoe to drop
[4:45:53] <+Revenantreaver> What if the ship is filled with Jiangshi
[4:45:53] <rytisone> and then literal Evilak appears
[4:45:53] <ScreamLord> But then why do the lights still work?
[4:45:53] <%audrus> 100% market share of fart gas
[4:45:54] <ospreyworks> Can the Act 3 twist just be Wesker?
[4:45:55] <AFlyingTaco1> Or are they gonna pull a Scooby-Doo where the monster is actually real?
[4:45:56] <%MrBorisMakarov> look at all that gas across the floor monkaS
[4:45:56] <LixFury> Wow that gas is fuckin think
[4:45:57] <+ArtoriasTheTrenchfighter> Look at that fart gas
[4:45:57] <%Dutchpotato> @LoliKappa cmonBruh what you say
[4:45:57] <GalaxyGirlChel> or so they think Jebaited
[4:46:05] <SpaceGuntank> evil chinese fart gas is all over the floor
[4:46:05] <swipperswapper> now watch real ghosts show up and it gets real fucked
[4:46:05] <Tressing> There better be a real monster somewhere in this ship
[4:46:07] <+valkuma> Paige, suck the popcorn kernel out of pats teeth.
[4:46:08] <SulfurousAcid> Uruboros
[4:46:08] <Ner234> inb4 the ship is still ACTUALLY cursed tho
[4:46:13] <GalaxyGirlChel> nazi vampires
[4:46:13] <$GarbageNirvana> So what's gonna be the Wendigo of this game
[4:46:16] <%jobbedbone> get the dino flossers out
[4:46:18] <+fingalights> The kid is real
[4:46:20] <+twohitgood> when you're tripping balls, it does help to be aware that you're tripping balls.
[4:46:21] <%jobbedbone> those things are magic
[4:46:21] <GarbageQueenEllie> @AFlyingTaco1 That only happens in the movies. In all the tv shows, the monster is fake.
[4:46:23] <danknugglit> Id settle for land, or even a slightly less cursed ship
[4:46:23] <transporterthesequel> Also, reminder, there is a crazy dude with a sledgehammer
[4:46:24] <+RealPT1> dat fluffy pile of elmo
[4:46:25] <Derkinstacker> DED
[4:46:26] <AFlyingTaco1> @GarbageNirvana Voodoo magic

[4:46:29] <ospreyworks> @SulfurousAcid Hahahah, yup
[4:46:30] <Zaphire_Saucypants> at this point, I'd just tie my wrist to someone else's

[4:46:31] <%audrus> PULL THE LEVER KRONK
[4:46:31] <King_Wolf_Rigger> uh, no. It's not
[4:46:31] <Louie_Salmon> Just realized, Brad has a very similar role to Chidi, especially right now
[4:46:31] <+DERGONS86> There's a real monster/ghost which is ALSO going crazy
[4:46:33] <Jetsfantasy> We need some kind of mutated creature to pair with the crazy
[4:46:34] <+Sh00s> he bout to get shocked
[4:46:34] <Thenuclearwalrus> DO NOT
[4:46:35] <Zaphire_Saucypants> make sure we don't lose each other
[4:46:37] <NeroInfinite> It's like 70 years old my dude

[4:46:44] <patismyhero> Turn the crazy nob all the way up now.
[4:46:44] <+Revenantreaver> should'nt the engines have died years ago because theres no fuel?
[4:46:45] <+merylinspants> this seems like a bad idea but ok
[4:46:46] <ScreamLord> @GarbageNirvana Cthulhu maybe?
[4:46:47] <+codepoke> Cursed fuel
[4:46:47] <+Ragnarok1890> What a weird way to grab that switch

[5:09:30] <+nekodelic> that was short
[5:09:30] <$Falilth> he's on the boat for me so uhhhhhhhhh
[5:09:30] <broth_elemental> Wow that sucked
[5:09:30] <Bigbossman91> We didn't see Conrad die though
[5:09:31] <Louie_Salmon> This better be a fakeout
[5:09:32] <%Ell1ot> why did the coast guard take him?
[5:09:32] <ShadeTheNovice> That was really short yeah
[5:09:33] <DSD24> Wait did I miss something
[5:09:34] <OldDarkwraith> Until Dawn Was Better
[5:09:34] <gravitydazequeen> it should've acutally cursed
[5:09:35] <Dame_90> EZ Clap
[5:09:35] <CptBritches> That was a big step down from Until Dawn
[5:09:35] <+Tornix> It was all drugs. Sounds like a Layton game

[5:09:46] <+Niney_Who> Conrad still alive, just back in the ship
[5:09:46] <NeroInfinite> This is good end

[5:09:50] <+Hilleltaco> Maybe Conrad lives there now
[5:09:51] <SwindlerOfProgress> We don't KNOW he's dead
[5:09:52] <implied_consent> Until Dawn had hitter chicks.
[5:09:54] <ospreyworks> Conrad must stay on the Duke, not attempt to steal the pirate speedboat.
[5:09:54] <KingKZ> Started slow, but man did it pick up.
[5:09:54] <+CJett92> Unless you pause
[5:09:54] <AFlyingTaco1> This better be a fakeout
[5:09:55] <%FrostedZaibatsu> Kinda felt short
[5:09:55] <AdmiralButtloaf> Conrad is the new windego
[5:09:56] <Tressing> BOO THIS GAME..

[5:09:59] <ospreyworks> Oops
[5:10:00] <GyroBrando> Not in a hurry in the pause menu
[5:10:00] <danknugglit> This was like 1\3 of until dawn
[5:10:01] <Stab_master_ars0n> Good job Paige. Pat you fucked up.
[5:10:02] <+YumoNikki> Well, technically this is the best ending since the only reason the pirates attacked in the first place is because Conrad was a douchebag flaunting his cash. yumoniSIP

[5:10:45] <gyro_gogo_zeppeli> EPISODE 2 SILENT HILL
[5:10:48] <GalaxyGirlChel> hat man is death
[5:10:48] <%nmaten> that end was fucking weak
[5:10:48] <Dragon_Batman> Condrad might have hooded guy
[5:10:48] <professormorrigan> EVEN MORE O DEATH
[5:10:48] <MadDesperado13> conrad isn't dead
[5:10:48] <%jiin6> Chip chip cheerios
[5:10:48] <%GarbageQueenEllie> I mean, at least Conrad got to do the right thing before getting fucked over
[5:10:49] <waifoong98> LUL
[5:10:49] <Prevot> that conrad end is the dumbest shit ever
[5:10:49] <forgetme000> kinda Anticlimactic
[5:10:50] <ZE_Count> IF you guys rushed up when swimming you would of died of the bends at the end.
[5:10:50] <%shiny_prinny> so when's the genocide run?
[5:10:50] <TikanZK> What if the Curator is Conrad
[5:10:50] <+NobuuNobuu> Did everyone survive?
[5:10:51] <+Shacklebox> not if I don't buy the next game fucker
[5:10:51] <AFlyingTaco1> For real though fuck that
[5:10:52] <%rosemon5001> now for the alternate path story
[5:10:52] <missingangle> It's... IRON MAN
[5:10:52] <%Estuko> @PeachSaliva So does mean you win
[5:10:53] <ghostpalacio> neat
[5:10:57] <derap41> But for real a ghost ship would have been cooler
[5:10:57] <eco419> rip vod
[5:10:57] <$darcfowler1995> fuck you Magic Man
[5:10:58] <+BLK_HRLQN_13> When's Peter StormHAIR
[5:10:58] <Nixonesque> is this a remix of the until dawn song?
[5:10:58] <danknugglit> !Uptime
[5:10:59] <gyro_gogo_zeppeli> SILENT HILL INCOMING
[5:11:01] <rytisone> Conrad death was not confirmed
[5:11:01] <+lupus_man> @peachsaliva there’s a real downer end if you don’t get the cap
[5:11:03] <tdm5wp> Is Mozart’s requiem in the background?
[5:11:03] <%Kenzo2000> and then they were all disappeared by the government for finding all that highly classified shit
[5:11:03] <+Jaysky> Not skip it.
[5:11:04] <Nixonesque> oh it is
[5:11:04] <+TheImmortal70> The ghost ship would've been WAY cooler
[5:11:04] <Tressing> Fuck off Not Peter Stormhare
[5:11:04] <derekwst3> ?
[5:11:05] <%lewdskeletor13> ANOTHER O DEATH
[5:11:06] <+SmoochSpider> dont skip
[5:11:06] <nevan0> this song good tho
[5:11:07] <Xenioplate> So who died and lived?
[5:11:09] <tigerfang86> that was really nice until the LAME ASS CONRAD END
[5:11:09] <%kiiiirsten> it woudl take Conrad 30 seconds to die in that boat from his own assholeism
[5:11:09] <$AgentTexes> This was a terrible game. I honestly can't believe it's by the same dev team. The models being funky, animations being poorly done consistently, the story/flow/dialog was bad for half the cast. BAD GAME.
[5:11:09] <%jiin6> TALK OVER THE MUSIC
[5:11:10] <Sol_Install> don't skip
[5:11:13] <%Mister_McDerp> conrad alive
[5:11:14] <NiktenKing> a remix of the original song?
[5:11:19] <iaraCatunda> nice oh death remix
[5:11:19] <+arfsm95> god fucking dammit I JUST GOT HERE
[5:11:20] <Tressing> skip that shit
[5:11:20] <King_Wolf_Rigger> You won, but Conrad is unknown.
[5:11:21] <CptBritches> I can't believe that's it
[5:11:21] <gyro_gogo_zeppeli> pffffft 1 death
[5:11:22] <%NWR_James> big survival
[5:11:22] <Nixonesque> it's a remix of the song from until dawn
[5:11:22] <+Revenantreaver> listen to that vod mute
[5:11:22] <gravitydazequeen> This game is good to watch tbh
[5:11:22] <tigerfang86> KINDA SORTA 0 DEATH
[5:11:22] <Dragon_Batman> For a 30$ game this wasn't too bad, Rip archive tho
[5:11:23] <+PatchworkSquid> there was a big hint for the stinger in the first couple minutes.
[5:11:24] <professormorrigan> Conrad's fate is ambiguous.
[5:11:24] <+Mr_Pylon> eh might as well don't skip
[5:11:24] <+starkandstag> apatBig apatBig apatBig apatBig apatBig apatBig
[5:11:25] <%jiin6> only care of those 4
[5:11:26] <iaraCatunda> danny died right?
[5:11:26] <Thenuclearwalrus> That was it? That was a bit of a let down
[5:11:26] <Gorgodrn> I like the remix
[5:11:26] <waifoong98> Thought the song was bugged and loop for a sec there
[5:11:27] <Zombrocom> Conrad is totally dead
[5:11:28] <NiktenKing> Rap REMIX
[5:11:28] <$jorgamund> WTF is this version
[5:11:29] <%GarbageQueenEllie> Implied that Conrad had his own badass adventure
[5:11:30] <AFlyingTaco1> Wow what a terrible story
[5:11:32] <+FoolsArcade> WHAT THE FUCK
[5:11:33] <%romanticzomedy> THIS IS BAD
[5:11:33] <+CarlosEoM> good enough
[5:11:34] <+SergeantSov> What in gods name
[5:11:34] <%kiiiirsten> Okay now do it again but don't let Conrad leave
[5:11:34] <%TUMZfestival> UH UH UH UH UH
[5:11:37] <CptBritches> Conrad showing up alone makes no fucking sense
[5:11:39] <nevan0> LOL
[5:11:39] <rariirar> yo yo yo yo yo yo yo yo......
[5:11:39] <DinoBear_7> Ew yucky remix
[5:11:39] <%Sphincter_Spelunker> bars
[5:11:40] <%jobbedbone> so you got points off for her being momentarily scared?
[5:11:40] <SulfurousAcid> there's no guarantee that Conrad made it back out
[5:11:41] <+FoolsArcade> is this music???
[5:11:41] <ryderbootz> this is a tell tale game godamn this shit sucks
[5:11:43] <+Niney_Who> How can this beee
[5:11:43] <derekwst3> Conrad might be going crazy
[5:11:44] <%TUMZfestival> PHAT BEATS
[5:11:45] <KingKZ> This song will be remixed 15 times before the end of the anthology.
[5:11:45] <+Revenantreaver> WHAT DO THE NUMBERS MEAN MASON
[5:11:46] <RupanSen> doesn't make sense that he would come back alone
[5:11:47] <rytisone> Conrad should've just chilled at the beach
[5:11:48] <%shockzndrawe> That was a lot shorter than Until Dawn
[5:11:48] <+TheImmortal70> They probably got a druggy ending
[5:11:49] <LordWaldemaart> he is super dead
[5:11:50] <ShadeTheNovice> This was honestly kinda underwhelming
[5:11:51] <%TUMZfestival> ENNY MEENIE MINEY MO
[5:11:55] <+TheDullaMAN> But what does it MEAN?!
[5:11:56] <%galveria> Gotta say, I found that mediocre compared to UntilDawn
[5:11:56] <%jiin6> Conrad huffin that happy gas
[5:11:57] <Laironx3> Jebaited
[5:11:59] <LokimenD> That ending for Conrad is stupid so I refuse to take it as real
[5:12:00] <%jobbedbone> take my horse to the old town road
[5:12:00] <%shockzndrawe> Paige you did good
[5:12:00] <gyro_gogo_zeppeli> Man, that was Medan
[5:12:01] <JumbleJams> it was neat
[5:12:01] <SovPho> it wasn't nearly as good as until dawn
[5:12:01] <NiktenKing> Of Medan
[5:12:01] <OldDarkwraith> ROCKY
[5:12:01] <+TheImmortal70> It was shorter, there was some jank, and there wasn't actually an interesting threat
[5:12:02] <CptBritches> I do wonder what Conrad showing up by himself means considering it makes no sense
[5:12:02] <Tarcanist_> RALPH STANLEY IS TURNING OVER IN HIS GRAVE BECAUSE OF THESE BAD COVERS
[5:12:03] <eco419> spoil me uwu
[5:12:04] <%Sphincter_Spelunker> Saw the sun go down in real time
[5:12:05] <razdoop> This is so awesome
[5:12:05] <InugamiTheHound> yeah rap music that's what the kids want
[5:12:06] <+d00msdaydan> no fuckin way the credits for this game would be so short
[5:12:06] <GalaxyGirlChel> @ShadeTheNovice very underwhelming
[5:12:07] <JoeStillLife> I thought it was good
[5:12:08] <%shockzndrawe> Despite the fuck ups
[5:12:09] <ospreyworks> it needed another twist
[5:12:10] <%romanticzomedy> The whole game was at BESt a C
[5:12:11] <%shiny_prinny> how much was this game?
[5:12:11] <%DatAsuna> This sucked
[5:12:11] <+logoth_> Bad dialog, really bad dialog
[5:12:11] <derap41> The chemical twist was kinda lame
[5:12:11] <professormorrigan> It's way lower quality than Until Dawn.
[5:12:11] <CopperTucker> I liked it
[5:12:11] <gyro_gogo_zeppeli> Its shorter than Until Dawn
[5:12:11] <%Caidezes> That was better than Until Dawn for me.
[5:12:12] <%LodiFrostbeard> @TUMZfestival C.O.M.P
[5:12:12] <DjFrostBite95> SourPls
[5:12:12] <prime_name> Not as solid as Until Dawn
[5:12:13] <%TUMZfestival> RUNAWAY GANG
[5:12:14] <+arfsm95> god fucking dammit I JUST GOT HERE
[5:12:14] <+hazzy_o7> You guys probably missed out on whole sections with Conrad
[5:12:14] <Shadope342> way shorter than until dawn
[5:12:14] <+mikesapartment> it's really not
[5:12:15] <Dragon_Batman> I figure he isn't alone cuz they don't have another model to be with him
[5:12:15] <LokimenD> But the game sucks tho
[5:12:15] <FirearmsInstructor> @PeachSaliva Murder EVERYONE D:
[5:12:16] <$wolfofsound> It's not for me
[5:12:16] <%DatAsuna> But horror movies suck
[5:12:16] <ospreyworks> It needed an Act 3 monster
[5:12:16] <danknugglit> This was really short tho
[5:12:17] <Ion_Laser> Supermassive Games needs new writers
[5:12:17] <%Dutchpotato> keep in min d this game is way cheaper than until dawn
[5:12:18] <$jorgamund> they should've just reused the version of this song from O Brother Where Art Thou
[5:12:21] <Junkles> at BEST at beat me
[5:12:21] <samuraijakanddaxter> where was the necromancer?
[5:12:21] <CriticKitten> It was alright
[5:12:21] <AFlyingTaco1> BUT WE ALL KNOW THAT IT'S JUST GAS.
[5:12:22] <+TheImmortal70> Nah the replayability won't help because there's nothing actually happening
[5:12:24] <gravitydazequeen> Now that i think about it, Conrad still has a ship and can easily just leave
[5:12:25] <%SirGO0SE> we didnt see the warlock at all
[5:12:25] <%DatAsuna> until dawn sucks too
[5:12:25] <%furiousfurioso> theres SO MUCH that was missed by having Conrad leave
[5:12:26] <%nmaten> the whole story being just hallucinations went nowhere i was expecting a twist or something
[5:12:26] <+TSMBokuNoPico> this game is also the first of FIVE
[5:12:26] <%jou_star> meh
[5:12:26] <derekwst3> but problem we know the monster so its less fun @PeachSaliva
[5:12:26] <Dame_90> How did you like the game? Might replay again for the Curator Cut
[5:12:26] <Louie_Salmon> Until Dawn was like twice as long
[5:12:27] <+Sp3ctre48> Compared to Until Dawn it just felt sloppy
[5:12:27] <%rosemon5001> now to start the alternate path story @PeachSaliva
[5:12:27] <King_Wolf_Rigger> It was pretty okay. Not bad.
[5:12:29] <DinoBear_7> It was meh pretty constantly
[5:12:29] <Gorgodrn> I still think Until Dawn is better
[5:12:31] <DraxTD> @PeachSaliva so Better than ANY David Cage game?
[5:12:32] <ghostpalacio> this song sucks
[5:12:33] <AFlyingTaco1> There is LITERALLY no threat aside form the pirates!
[5:12:33] <%romanticzomedy> The writing wasn't charmingly cheesy like Until Dawn, the characters sucked, it was just... bland
[5:12:34] <Charuzu> this relied a bit too much on jump scares compared to Until Dawn
[5:12:34] <%jiin6> it was good cause pat paige were playing, it would have been more amazing if Elmo played
[5:12:35] <+Hilleltaco> An entire character was gone for a lot of it, so I'd imagine there's a fair bit of variation
[5:12:36] <ospreyworks> Until Dawn was better
[5:12:38] <+Mr_Pylon> I hope that they go full monster with the next one.
[5:12:39] <bearwith10000faces> better than until dawn def
[5:12:39] <Bigbossman91> this version of O' Death fucking sucks
[5:12:40] <+CJett92> The beginning until the hallucinations started was kinda bad tho. Really awkward storytelling
[5:12:41] <+Tadashi047> Until Dawn is still the best of their games
[5:12:42] <SunnyD_Solaire> Very mediocre
[5:12:42] <otakon17> I hope we get some scifi monster stuff
[5:12:42] <+TheImmortal70> The most interesting part was the time loop with Brad but that was the only time it was actually decent
[5:12:43] <patismyhero> Had fun hanging out.
[5:12:43] <CptBritches> Until Dawn had better acting, more logical story connecting the spooky scenes and much less awkward cuts and edits
[5:12:44] <professormorrigan> No supernatural threats :/
[5:12:44] <Sol_Install> guys
[5:12:44] <nevan0> was not great
[5:12:44] <Dragon_Batman> Again 30 buck game
[5:12:45] <+Revenantreaver> its probably more fun controlling than watching
[5:12:45] <+Engwithan_Elder_God> It was fun.
[5:12:46] <tigerfang86> that was a REALLY FUN story
[5:12:47] <derap41> little hope was an indian battle right?
[5:12:47] <@Calek> I was tense the entire time
[5:12:48] <otakon17> I liked watching it
[5:12:48] <+Niney_Who> I believe it is more fun with a Real monster
[5:12:48] <JumbleJams> a fun ride
[5:12:48] <+ScantronTheImmortal> seems like a fun hangout game
[5:12:48] <EASrake> Yeah but there was a fucking Lich on the DAMN SHIP
[5:12:51] <+SyStemicLOSS> Great game!
[5:12:52] <abakkus> i liked these characters way more than until dawn. except conrad. fuck conrad.
[5:12:53] <ospreyworks> It had a more fun plot
[5:12:53] <$AgentTexes> This was a terrible game. I honestly can't believe it's by the same dev team. The models being funky, animations being poorly done consistently, the story/flow/dialog was bad for half the cast. BAD GAME.
[5:12:54] <+valkuma> The voice acting was just SUPER fucking bad
[5:12:54] <derekwst3> it was fun but their was no monster
[5:12:54] <ZE_Count> Yeah it was pretty bad cuts,bad acting and writing.
[5:12:54] <moosemonkey397> once it was cleawr what the gold was I lost every bit of tension
[5:12:55] <RupanSen> it was fine but a bit anticlimactic
[5:12:56] <%TUMZfestival> this is like 90's movies where the credits have a rap about the plot haha
[5:12:56] <%shiny_prinny> you CAN have fun with bad games
[5:12:57] <+TSMBokuNoPico> @PeachSaliva the next one looks even better!
[5:12:57] <+TheKanMan> The faces looked so bad
[5:12:58] <%kiiiirsten> Did we ever see the Demon Child again
[5:12:58] <%shockzndrawe> It was also stand alone as a single game
[5:12:58] <+merylinspants> it was a fun campy horror story
[5:12:58] <JumbleJams> replay for LICH
[5:12:59] <Sol_Install> Chat, don't try to damper it for paige
[5:12:59] <razdoop> I had so much fun too paige
[5:12:59] <SovPho> Okay, so here's what I think is wrong: There is absolutely no mystery. It was instantly obvious what was going on.
[5:13:00] <+textandnumbers> liked until dawn better
[5:13:00] <%alex_id> it was a fun story
[5:13:00] <%sakeydo> make the next one have real magic!
[5:13:00] <eco419> Fun indeed gj ginger duo
[5:13:00] <LokimenD> No excuse for bad writing
[5:13:00] <Tressing> Off to a bad start
[5:13:01] <tigerfang86> the end was pretty meh but the STORY TO GET THERE was really good
[5:13:01] <KingKZ> Probably better to play than watch.
[5:13:03] <%Lion_kun> and it's way shorter
[5:13:03] <+HelveticaScenario> Glad I didn't buy this
[5:13:04] <+Shacklebox> Until Dawn sets an unrealistic precedent
[5:13:04] <LORDSPOOKLEKINS> Too many jumpscares
[5:13:05] <patismyhero> Was pretty good.
[5:13:06] <%shockzndrawe> Where this is an anthology
[5:13:07] <ospreyworks> The wendigos were a great surprise
[5:13:10] <+MrHaru> This is almost in every way worse than Until Dawn
[5:13:10] <%Sphincter_Spelunker> This felt like a $40 game
[5:13:11] <ZE_Count> Just bad writing and acting
[5:13:11] <samuraijakanddaxter> was the necromancer just a hallucination like everything else?
[5:13:12] <Dame_90> This game was only $29.99 where Until Dawn was 59.99 so it was gonna be a bigger game regardless
[5:13:12] <+Shacklebox> lots of cool ending
[5:13:12] <%audrus> conrad's fate: shithead no matter what
[5:13:13] <CptBritches> Fliss and Brad were the only decent characters
[5:13:14] <+SyStemicLOSS> I loved it
[5:13:14] <%deviljhojho94> I would have preferred supernatural elements
[5:13:14] <%TUMZfestival> IMA LYRICAL MIRACLE
[5:13:15] <+textandnumbers> more likable characters, seemed like more ways to screw up too
[5:13:17] <Jolly_Adventurer> Dialogue was still pretty shoddy
[5:13:17] <%DatAsuna> other, lamer endings
[5:13:18] <Gorgodrn> It was fun for sure
[5:13:19] <%galveria> This felt like it lacked an act
[5:13:19] <danknugglit> Not many threats
[5:13:21] <Zedimonx5> So what was the monster in this? Ghost skeletons?
[5:13:23] <%shockzndrawe> Wait what was the evil though?
[5:13:23] <+Niney_Who> The Cop one
[5:13:23] <%Caidezes> All this complaining though.
[5:13:24] <ospreyworks> In Patient
[5:13:24] <Zombrocom> Nah, the other endings are worse
[5:13:24] <hussdogrob> Man of Medan, long movie, shorter game
[5:13:24] <%Lion_kun> Until Dawn had a better fleshed out story
[5:13:24] <Dhurkst> Hidden Agenda
[5:13:25] <%Mister_McDerp> It should have had a real supernatural thing mixed in
[5:13:25] <%shockzndrawe> Just gas?
[5:13:25] <akaSiggy> Apparently there are 14 endings?
[5:13:27] <$wolfofsound> I'd rather they take time to make a great game
[5:13:27] <headphonegraveyard> the fuck was that wizard dude?!
[5:13:28] <MarylandJutsu> The InPatient
[5:13:28] <EASrake> Rush of blood?
[5:13:28] <notToph> too bad they worked on a fucking phone game and a VR game since Until Dawn and not just this
[5:13:28] <RunningNGunning> I guess they kinda need a story where it turns out that it really was nothing in the end so that it can be a surprise in other stories that there really is a monster
[5:13:30] <%Lion_kun> this is just oh it was gas
[5:13:31] <%Lion_kun> go home
[5:13:31] <SovPho> until dawn, spirit tracks?
[5:13:32] <orangemdt> that ending made no sense. Why was Conrad even allowed to be right next to a machine gun
[5:13:33] <Tressing> The enemy was Fart Gas
[5:13:34] <+TheImmortal70> I think I'm done with the devs frankly. They made a good game and now they're making eh.
[5:13:34] <Sokumotanaka> Honestly for me? I'm character driven man I didn't really care about any of the characters so it's meh to me personally
[5:13:34] <Louie_Salmon> I guess it was $30, that makes sense
[5:13:35] <%rosemon5001> cough cough alternate story path is an actual option
[5:13:35] <$darcfowler1995> would you guys quit being assholes that was pretty good it's okay for it to be cheesy I had a good time
[5:13:36] <razdoop> There is a lot of endings chat including everyone can die
[5:13:37] <punkthepsychopenguin> THIS GAME SUCUUCUCUCUCUCUCUCUCKS
[5:13:37] <patismyhero> Next run all gun
[5:13:40] <Dementedpenguin> the impatient?
[5:13:40] <ospreyworks> Until Dawn had 2 good twists
[5:13:48] <lionmanguy> Wait there was one between until dawn and this?
[5:13:49] <LordWaldemaart> all endings are bad
[5:13:51] <+Niney_Who> It's beeN YEARS PAIGe
[5:13:51] <ospreyworks> This had 1 you could see a mile off
[5:13:52] <%sirisvirus> I think making it a non supernatural cause is kinda boring
[5:13:53] <%sakeydo> REAL MAGIC!
[5:13:53] <Dragon_Batman> Ask
[5:13:55] <Badgerconda_> So... Until Dawn was like a David Cage game done well... this game was like Until Dawn made by David Cage.
[5:13:58] <iaraCatunda> Spoil it!!!!
[5:14:00] <missingangle> Paige!! It's been years when it came out
[5:14:00] <%Caidezes> He already said it, Paige. lol
[5:14:00] <KaseKaizer> "only"
[5:14:00] <+timblenaut> who gives a fuck paige its an old game
[5:14:01] <Mr_Loboto> You just played the whole game though
[5:14:01] <%InnocentAce> So I googled Manchurian Gold and the first search result is a FOIA request to the CIA detailing gold mining in Manchuria during and after WW2
[5:14:02] <eco419> spoil it more
[5:14:03] <+SergeantSov> Who tf hasn't seen the Until dawn endings, expose yourself cowards
[5:14:03] <+TSMBokuNoPico> @PeachSaliva the next one looks even better!
[5:14:03] <+SyStemicLOSS> I liked it
[5:14:05] <JumbleJams> Kreygasm
[5:14:06] <Louie_Salmon> This death rap going hard
[5:14:08] <+TheImmortal70> Nah this is nowhere near david cage
[5:14:10] <$Agami23> 12 years ago paige
[5:14:11] <Shadope342> for until dawn it was just kidding, until the fuckin actual monster showed up
[5:14:14] <startstoprepeat> at least this is better than hidden agenda
[5:14:14] <iaraCatunda> but its a really expensiv game...
[5:14:15] <thunderborn32> that is rediculous it was a full price game with that length
[5:14:16] <%jiin6> creepy drug ghosts
[5:14:17] <+Jaysky> I think making it non supernatural is good though, cause everyone expects supernatural
[5:14:18] <Dr_Mooose> WTF I just went to get food, what happened?
[5:14:19] <+Mr_Pylon> This was pretty alright
[5:14:20] <samuraijakanddaxter> sometimes things just... end
[5:14:20] <benjiFG> fuck it
[5:14:20] <FirearmsInstructor> @PeachSaliva ITS SUPER GHOSTS
[5:14:20] <Dragon_Batman> The budget shows which is probably why this was put out for 30 bucks
[5:14:20] <%ODSTEvan147> Wait, I just notice this was a thing.
[5:14:20] <+TheImmortal70> It SHOULD be a ghost
[5:14:21] <Ion_Laser> This game needed more ambiguity like Until Dawn
[5:14:21] <eco419> Wendigos
[5:14:21] <+Shacklebox> the first one was hard magic
[5:14:22] <+Niney_Who> WITCH GHOSTS
[5:14:23] <VritraReiRei> @PeachSaliva so if you think the game has replay value because of multiple endings, does that mean you will REPLAY it again!? PogChamp
[5:14:25] <transporterthesequel> oh it's not a ghosWAIT ITS GHOSTS
[5:14:25] <Zantetzuken> the inpatient @lionmanguy
[5:14:26] <%kiiiirsten> Literally stab the fuckin' ghost
[5:14:26] <+TheImmortal70> Then it's an actual threat
[5:14:26] <%shockzndrawe> @PeachSaliva Hey so I couldn't think of any good shitposts, so should I just draw you guys fucking around on a boat for this one
[5:14:27] <%ItsRatman> Oh its scientific... Wait no its actually a ghost!
[5:14:27] <%Sphincter_Spelunker> @PeachSaliva Until Dawn was 4 years ago
[5:14:27] <razdoop> I fucking loved this so awesome
[5:14:28] <%wholewheat420> @PeachSaliva Are you two going to replay this for another ending on stream?
[5:14:29] <SunnyD_Solaire> i was hoping it was zombies
[5:14:30] <%DatAsuna> all endings suck
[5:14:30] <ovan20> YEAH FUCK IT, IT'S A MOSNTAR!
[5:14:31] <gravitydazequeen> it should've been ghosts!
[5:14:31] <CptBritches> I would've preferred actual supernatural
[5:14:31] <+Shacklebox> they're all connected
[5:14:32] <%audrus> i do want like some kinda mysticism or magic or fantasy in the next
[5:14:32] <EASrake> THERE WAS A LICH
[5:14:32] <ospreyworks> Until Dawn had "Is it slasher?" "No, BUT."
[5:14:33] <+nekodelic> I hopr it's vampires
[5:14:33] <%ShichiNoBushi> There were real wendigoes in Until Dawn.
[5:14:34] <RushUnplugged> look at how many people wanting to be THAT GUY hating on stuff
[5:14:34] <thunderborn32> length was a ripoff
[5:14:35] <KingKZ> The goal of the next one should be to kill all the characters.
[5:14:35] <%ODSTEvan147> Is the stream ending?
[5:14:36] <RupanSen> I hope they're doing one with aliens
[5:14:36] <Sokumotanaka> All endings are bad cause you find out it's over when you don't want it to end
[5:14:36] <+nekomancerer> where's the voodoo wizrd?
[5:14:37] <+PatchworkSquid> @peachsaliva you picked up the clue for this earlier.
[5:14:38] <%jobbedbone> are these in the same universe with the same magic rules?
[5:14:39] <LokimenD> Either that or not make the drugs reveal halfway thorugh the story
[5:14:40] <Djinnazz> Until dawn was legit cryptids pat.
[5:14:42] <%TUMZfestival> remix of until dawn theme btw
[5:14:42] <+Shacklebox> it was a SKELLYTON
[5:14:42] <derap41> The two headed corpse was probably agent orange victim
[5:14:43] <SailingSaturn> @PeachSaliva you mean like Uncharted? cirISee
[5:14:43] <gyro_gogo_zeppeli> 4/5
[5:14:44] <+Ultimate_Edge> That voice acting could use some improvement
[5:14:44] <%kiiiirsten> Until Dawn was magic
[5:14:44] <Hyp3r4ctive> well like one ending of until dawn was totally "it's a monster"
[5:14:44] <CptBritches> The acting and edits in this were just so rough

The Necromancer was a vision Liss could have if she didn’t step outside. Also there has to be SOME supernatural thing going on, since you could see the Curator during certain visions. I think he may be a Satan like figure that observes morbid stories and we’ll see him in every story. Thanks for the fun stream

[5:17:00] <gyro_gogo_zeppeli> PLAY CURATOR
[5:17:01] <Louie_Salmon> Or a future thing
[5:17:01] <+TheImmortal70> Hallucination is literally every answer and that's one of the reasons this game was meh
[5:17:02] <Dragon_Batman> Maybe if Conrad was there he would get that scene
[5:17:03] <ospreyworks> She fears the supernatural
[5:17:03] <aeravon> I'm really happy with that. you guys did a fantastic job
[5:17:03] <King_Wolf_Rigger> The Lich isn't real.
[5:17:04] <Dhurkst> May have been revealed in the best ending
[5:17:07] <$SvenHolgersson> INB4 BANNED
[5:17:09] <+Sp3ctre48> So who was the Man of Medana? 🤔

[5:17:13] <%Sphincter_Spelunker> thanks ps4 ResidentSleeper
[5:17:15] <derap41> If you don't take a breather you get more halluciantions
[5:17:17] <ospreyworks> She would fear voodoo and stuff like that

[5:17:37] <evilchris22> meh
[5:17:37] <CyborgAV> Yeah

[5:17:37] <derekwst3> im sweating
[5:17:38] <SovPho> Fun for a while, but it kinda became predictable.
[5:17:38] <%luckybudman> yeah
[5:17:38] <+Sp3ctre48> it was okau

[5:17:39] <%audrus> i had a whole fun
[5:17:40] <+TheImmortal70> @peachsaliva It was very fun, the game being whatever doesn't change the hijinks.
[5:17:41] <$SvenHolgersson> I had fun watching the big not murder
[5:17:41] <Tressing> Very short and very meh... Had fun tho..
[5:17:42] <+twohitgood> that was fun
[5:17:42] <%panic_rabbit> goofy fun
[5:17:43] <%romanticzomedy> You guys were fun, the game was meh
[5:17:43] <%kiiiirsten> Thank you for another gr8 stream Mustard Queen
[5:17:43] <+Revenantreaver> yeah thats a fair price
[5:17:44] <%deviljhojho94> ONE GUY
[5:17:44] <%furiousfurioso> You guys missed a LOT by ditching Conrad
[5:17:44] <DrFacilier> i Hope that the next Anthology doesnt have nothing but jumpscares
[5:17:44] <hearingthenseeing> yeye
[5:17:45] <@MelBrooksKA> It was alright
[5:17:45] <corepool> it was fine
[5:17:46] <AlasterAngelo> No
[5:17:46] <eco419> si peachie:)
[5:17:46] <+Nanocomputer> elmo is big sleep
[5:17:47] <nevan0> WAS FUNNNNN
[5:17:47] <+RioGascar> For 30$ it was alright
[5:17:47] <%jou_star> So Pat time for another stream?
[5:17:47] <Sokumotanaka> I didn't play it so I didn't have fun :P
[5:17:47] <+SergeantSov> You guys were fun, the game not so much
[5:17:47] <Dame_90> GG Paige and Pat, might replay it again
[5:17:47] <DrGhostJelly> Good ride
[5:17:47] <+BakedPretzels> nice pants
[5:17:48] <%lewdskeletor13> That was really fun
[5:17:48] <Gorgodrn> yeee
[5:17:48] <+Darren716> $30 for that?!
[5:17:50] <%Sphincter_Spelunker> I liked when everyone sang Initial D
[5:17:50] <AFlyingTaco1> Okay that's fair then
[5:17:50] <%Mister_McDerp> but only 1 is good
[5:17:50] <JumbleJams> it was fun ride!
[5:17:51] <headphonegraveyard> oh its only 30??? thats worth it
[5:17:51] <star_feline> Elmo was best part
[5:17:51] <Zombrocom> There is 5
[5:17:52] <derekwst3> 14 dam
[5:17:52] <Zaphire_Saucypants> some of the acting was spotty.
[5:17:53] <%Kenzo2000> sipsipElmo sipsipElmo sipsipElmo sipsipElmo sipsipElmo
[5:17:53] <Bouldus> had more fun watching you play Baba
[5:17:53] <Arek_1> VoteYea
[5:17:54] <%GarbageQueenEllie> 30 dollars is a LOT in cheap people money!
[5:17:54] <patismyhero> Yes big fun.
[5:17:54] <missingangle> I got here like twenty minutes ago so it was fine.
[5:17:54] <alextrebeken> has she ever done a monster hunter stream
[5:17:54] <+mikesapartment> the main plot device being fart gas is really lame
[5:17:55] <FirearmsInstructor> @PeachSaliva Pat's gone. Quick, show pepis!
[5:17:55] <GalaxyGirlChel> It was too predictable
[5:17:55] <+Mr_Pylon> yeah that was very fun
[5:17:55] <%shockzndrawe> @PeachSaliva So I couldn't think of anygood shitposts from this game, so do you guys want me to just draw you guys fucking around on a boat or something instead
[5:17:56] <+Darren716> (X) DOUBT
[5:17:58] <gyro_gogo_zeppeli> JUNIOR THE HERO
[5:17:58] <CheekyBirb> it was fine
[5:17:58] <+Engwithan_Elder_God> I swear. You see 40 good opinions, then immediately focus on the 2 negative. :)
[5:17:58] <AFlyingTaco1> I thought this was a full-price game
[5:17:59] <+Nanocomputer> apatElmo apatElmo apatElmo apatElmo
[5:17:59] <KingKZ> Anything would be underwhelming compared to Until Dawn.
[5:18:00] <RupanSen> I wanted to see the Lich King
[5:18:01] <gravitydazequeen> it was a good 7.5/10
[5:18:02] <mostundesired> Oh, I showed up at the end of the stream FeelsBadMan
[5:18:02] <+lupus_man> @peachsaliva are you guys gonna do the directors cut scenes too?
[5:18:03] <+MrHaru> Endings doesn’t change how lame it is Paige. I got the experience of the game just watching this
[5:18:03] <KaseKaizer> Danny can't survive? FeelsBadMan
[5:18:03] <iaraCatunda> 30 dollars? theyre selling it full price in brazil :///
[5:18:04] <+Grithalmur> Congrats! It was fun to see you play!
[5:18:04] <$Shadowpint> I had fun but I didn't think it was great
[5:18:04] <CptBritches> The endings don't improve the acting and editing
[5:18:05] <+textandnumbers> i would rather get a full fledged game than a short 30 dollar thing
[5:18:05] <+HelveticaScenario> Had fun watching you play
[5:18:05] <%lewdskeletor13> There are a lot of variation
[5:18:06] <Charuzu> I just don't like how the only kind of scare were jump scares
[5:18:07] <derekwst3> ELMO
[5:18:07] <danknugglit> It was alright but you guys made it great :)
[5:18:08] <%galveria> Yeah. Game was disappointing but you guys are great
[5:18:08] <Ion_Laser> Supermassive Games needs a bigger budget for the next games in this series
[5:18:08] <abakkus> apatBig fuck conrad
[5:18:08] <+twohitgood> it was great. next time you need to get woolie and punch mom over and play 4 player.
[5:18:09] <%jobbedbone> Permutation endings kind of detract from that number
[5:18:09] <%Ell1ot> the coast guard bringing the guy with them was kinda stupid
[5:18:09] <%nmaten> it was ok, the story kinda went nowhere
[5:18:10] <@MelBrooksKA> Probably a lot better playing than watching
[5:18:12] <+codepoke> I literally couldn't do anything else to watch y'all play
[5:18:12] <$darcfowler1995> it was alright fuck off I had a good time quit being so damn critical
[5:18:16] <+Anonymasque> I like this concept for sure. It is like a game version of Crypt Keeper
[5:18:18] <%DatAsuna> game sucks, but only as much as until dawn sucked
[5:18:19] <Dhurkst> look at the precious EMLO
[5:18:19] <+TheImmortal70> Definitely a lot more fun playing than watching
[5:18:21] <+Sp3ctre48> There was more wrong than just the ending tbh
[5:18:22] <hussdogrob> not underwhelming just short in my opinion, it seems like it's a long ass movie but a short ass video game
[5:18:22] <Aceofhearts87> Good job @peachsaliva you guys did it and ya really fun time
[5:18:23] <+Darren716> You should get way more than 4 hours for $30
[5:18:24] <derekwst3> the acting was good
[5:18:25] <JoeStillLife> bunch of sour pusses
[5:18:28] <+Hilleltaco> Even if it was dumb, it was fun
[5:18:29] <gyro_gogo_zeppeli> Until Dawn was B movie too
[5:18:29] <+Dr_DangerPhD> this only being $30 makes it a way better value, enjoyed it for what it was
[5:18:29] <JumbleJams> chat is NO FUN
[5:18:29] <%ODSTEvan147> So my net is shit, but to the dude that gave me the sub, your the best dude
[5:18:30] <$Shadowpint> $30 seems too much for this, it's too short
[5:18:30] <%shockzndrawe> All that mouth breathing tho
[5:18:30] <%Sphincter_Spelunker> So was Until Dawn
[5:18:31] <%wholewheat420> Let people have fun holy shit
[5:18:31] <professormorrigan> Until Dawn did B-Horror way better.
[5:18:31] <derap41> That old lady might be a survivor for 70 years
[5:18:33] <%Mister_McDerp> It was good for what it was
[5:18:33] <SulfurousAcid> more like D movie
[5:18:33] <%jobbedbone> 8.5 at least
[5:18:33] <turretgunz> christ these fucking comments
[5:18:33] <+Revenantreaver> B-movie horror schlock would've had Jeffrey Combs
[5:18:34] <%romanticzomedy> There's a difference between shlock and just actual bad writing
[5:18:34] <+Darren716> B movies are $5
[5:18:34] <King_Wolf_Rigger> It's fucking GHOST SHIP people
[5:18:35] <%jou_star> still feels meh to me.The writing hurts
[5:18:35] <$Rumbutt> Let people enjoy things
[5:18:36] <%GarbageQueenEllie> It was like watching a modern horror Oregon Trail
[5:18:36] <Gutsandlove> fun times
[5:18:37] <+fingalights> It served its purpose
[5:18:38] <abakkus> i was hard clenched this whole time ur chat's a mess
[5:18:39] <eco419> then it was worth
[5:18:39] <Sol_Install> Some people just don't have fun
[5:18:40] <%Caidezes> Chat's real bad today.
[5:18:40] <AFlyingTaco1> Until Dawn was great tho
[5:18:41] <%lewdskeletor13> It was fun
[5:18:42] <OswaldTheDog> it’s fun!
[5:18:43] <CptBritches> That's what Until Dawn was but performed better
[5:18:43] <LokimenD> It was only fun because of you and Pat
[5:18:44] <Dragon_Batman> There were some bad line reads but alot of it was decent
[5:18:44] <TheBlankAce> Until Dawn set too high of a standard
[5:18:45] <Tressing> The concept is too good and they fucked it up..
[5:18:45] <Zaphire_Saucypants> It was okay for what it is
[5:18:45] <Mr_Loboto> its supposed to be mediocre but dont say it is though
[5:18:46] <+twohitgood> it's top tier for troma movies stuff so it's all good to me.
[5:18:46] <+MrHaru> Until Dawn had a stronger script and better actors
[5:18:46] <GalaxyGirlChel> It's really predictable where until dawn actually was not so much
[5:18:47] <JumbleJams> chat is sundowning
[5:18:48] <+Mr_Pylon> 10% of chat doesn't understand fun, got it
[5:18:49] <mostundesired> Guess I gotta watch the VOD Jebaited
[5:18:50] <%ItsRatman> still better than david cage so thats always a win :D
[5:18:51] <+CJett92> Game was ehh, but stream was fun
[5:18:51] <Laironx3> Chat is Roger Ebert Kappa
[5:18:52] <Huntercd> How did Elmo like it?
[5:18:53] <%Gouf_Troop> it wasnt actually scary, just a bunch of jump scares
[5:18:53] <@SSaryn> Me and Strident were literally making fun of the teeth that were showing on that one chick the whole time so hey, was still pretty fun.
[5:18:54] <autcetera> really unpolished but I like the serial concept
[5:18:55] <LixFury> I was really irritated with the junior scene, THEY NEW ABOUT THE GAS AND SAID NOTHING
[5:18:56] <Jetsfantasy> No use arguing with people who don't enjoy the same things or fight you about your enjoyments. Whats worth is worth in your eyes and your eyes only
[5:18:59] <%DatAsuna> It's very good at being shit
[5:18:59] <%Mister_McDerp> Until Dawn was better though
[5:19:00] <waifoong98> would have been fine if all the character wasn't this dumb
[5:19:01] <$Bt_Robot> I was sad that Peter Stormare did not return.
[5:19:02] <+Sh00s> a budget title video game doesn't need to be a 4 star movie
[5:19:02] <Sokumotanaka> @PeachSaliva I'm with you I like it but we can't get discouraged at others for disliking it
[5:19:02] <+twohitgood> any other lloyd kaufman fans?
[5:19:02] <Zaphire_Saucypants> Watching you two go through it probably improved my experience.
[5:19:02] <Dame_90> It was indeed fun will play again, GG Paige and Pat SeemsGood
[5:19:03] <patismyhero> Asshole Died in the end. That’s a good ending.
[5:19:03] <CheekyBirb> my opinion is still more important Kappa
[5:19:04] <$Agami23> i feel like there was a problem in that there was no actual threat. once you realized it was hallucinations, there was a single problem in the game.
[5:19:04] <CptBritches> Until Dawn was B-movie horror but with better actors and script
[5:19:05] <+CJett92> Jump scares for everything
[5:19:08] <FirearmsInstructor> @PeachSaliva Good job, Adderall.
[5:19:08] <RupanSen> No yeah it was fine but I expected a little something more
[5:19:08] <+hayley0wns> it was fun
[5:19:08] <SovPho> @PeachSaliva Okay so the amount of endings is 14? You have 5 primary characters? So you have some permutation of 5 deaths in the game, which would probably be like 5! (factoria) which is 125. So that means there are... weird endings.
[5:19:10] <%ODSTEvan147> YES
[5:19:11] <+TheImmortal70> @ssaryn she DID have some fucked up teeth
[5:19:12] <+MrHaru> It relied way too much on jump scares and really brought down how brooding it could have been
[5:19:14] <EASrake> I think this is a game that peoplve have already decided is bad
[5:19:14] <mostundesired> New game let's go Kappa
[5:19:15] <%ODSTEvan147> I'm not late!
[5:19:15] <star_feline> The night is about middle aged
[5:19:17] <+Ultimate_Edge> Until dawn was b movie horror. That was si-fi movie material
[5:19:20] <JumbleJams> TwitchUnity time for big sleep
[5:19:22] <Conky89> Young for the night owls. But not for the morning roosters.
[5:19:26] <%jobbedbone> elmo go for bag
[5:19:26] <LordWaldemaart> the story doesn't really change do they? just which qjicktime event fails
[5:19:29] <+lupus_man> @peachsaliva if you preordered the game once you finish it you you unlock the directors cut which has the scenes from different peoples perspectives
[5:19:29] <%waltzqueen> @PeachSaliva can we get something relaxing now?
[5:19:31] <danknugglit> Its over LUL
[5:19:33] <+Sp3ctre48> I mean it's just opinions in the end, some people will like it, some people are underwhelmed by it
[5:19:33] <CyborgAV> Dark Souls 2?
[5:19:34] <Dame_90> It was fun despite mixed reviews
[5:19:35] <+max_byer> West coast appreciates your definition of the night being young
[5:19:35] <orangemdt> MATH
[5:19:40] <+Revenantreaver> The ending where they all die but still escape
[5:19:41] <eco419> lets watch everyone die :)
[5:19:42] <+RioGascar> I actually think the game is too forgiving
[5:19:46] <headphonegraveyard> WHAT WAS THE WIZARD THOOO
[5:19:46] <King_Wolf_Rigger> PLAY BABA
[5:19:47] <derekwst3> wonder if the pirates survive
[5:19:47] <$AgentTexes> Until Dawn was also a B Horror movie shlock but the difference between that and this was that Until Dawn was good.
[5:19:47] <iaraCatunda> ASMR
[5:19:52] <indig0bird> There's probably an "everyone dies" ending taht's inevitable once certain conditions are met
[5:19:53] <%Sphincter_Spelunker> Dork Souls next time
[5:19:54] <+BKNPham> soooo BABA
[5:19:54] <Dragon_Batman> I imagine it is still people survive or not
[5:19:55] <mostundesired> Big sleep
[5:19:55] <alextrebeken> monster hunter
[5:19:57] <%lewdskeletor13> It does change a lot actually
[5:19:58] <tigerfang86> DARK SOULS THO
[5:19:59] <indig0bird> BABA
[5:19:59] <%Mister_McDerp> BUT WHO WAS WIZARD?
