[0:02:51] <$skizzuto> yes

[0:03:51] <Latija> yes
[0:03:52] <+SWFanatic> a horse is a horse of course of course
[0:03:52] <%SveriSageAdvice> yep
[0:03:56] <Valdorick> The weather changes, so its fine
[0:03:58] <$Sphincter_Spelunker> the summon?
[0:03:58] <Monkeyweed21> yea he can show up in the shroud
[0:04:02] <%dankjerri> sometimes, under specific weather. odin id HUGE
[0:04:04] <+VStan11> You dont really have to worry about it
[0:04:04] <Latija> there will be an evil fog if odin shows up
[0:04:05] <+MarkoTolstov> trust me, you'll KNOW what Odin is LUL
[0:04:07] <haisho> the weather will be all spooky in case he comes out

[0:04:11] <%Chichen> I AM on odin's horse LUL
[0:04:12] <Rumbutt> yeah sometimes Odin fate just pops up in shroud
[0:04:20] <%walternatorz> only get scared of evil horses if you're in a big fate circle with dramatic music
[0:04:20] <Monkeyweed21> MMOs take some learning
[0:04:29] <OneThousandTomatoes> also there'll be like 20 people fighting Odin
[0:04:31] <vVAstrAVv> odin only comes in the weather condition "gloom"
[0:04:38] <+SWFanatic> hey good lookin
[0:04:39] <+PA_Raiden333> I legit thought that was a setup for "odin deez nuts"

[0:05:13] <%JenovasPuppet> It's not. You CHOSE to fight the firefly!
[0:05:15] <haisho> because it's EVIL
[0:05:16] <+FingaLights> The most evil of creatures
[0:05:19] <+Quaraezha> I think Pat shouldn't be in a party so you actually get exp
[0:05:23] <%dankjerri> PATS OKAY
[0:05:28] <+bahiti> does Paige have equipment set to be automatically placed in the armory chest when received? otherwise they get placed in the inventory and 'recommended equipment'won't see it
[0:05:30] <+FunkyStreams> It because of Pat!
[0:05:30] <SanguineSkull> OH BOY
[0:05:35] <%Chichen> its still dying hard a bit
[0:05:39] <Monkeyweed21> twitch is shitting itself again yes
[0:05:42] <+FunkyStreams> He commanded Gief to pee on the outlet!
[0:05:42] <%Chichen> but more watchable
[0:05:45] <%DianaTheAscian> was the green screen just me?
[0:05:46] <%walternatorz> D:
[0:05:59] <SanguineSkull> SKELETON WARRIOR! DADADADADA!
[0:06:01] <OneThousandTomatoes> it's not
[0:06:09] <$Sphincter_Spelunker> Paige, when the healthbar is yellow, they're chill. You're being the aggressor
[0:06:10] <+FingaLights> Spread it's butt juice all over yourself
[0:06:11] <+SWFanatic> @DianaTheAscian maybe reload?
[0:06:13] <%dankjerri> da dadada
[0:06:15] <%Shotgun_Hobo1> Now I got the green screen
[0:06:18] <%walternatorz> she hasn't realize she is killing them of her own volition
[0:06:21] <+FingaLights> Become the glow
[0:06:32] <%nip_nips> you're in the wrong place anyways
[0:06:35] <OneThousandTomatoes> everyone is on a horse now
[0:06:38] <+RelikaNox> @bahiti It's set default to go into the armory
[0:06:38] <OneThousandTomatoes> LUL
[0:06:39] <%walternatorz> all this senseless skeleton murder
[0:06:39] <%JenovasPuppet> Why does Paige hate Fireflies so much? :O
[0:06:52] <%Dakuu75> is Odin jsut a boss that shows up, walking around, randomly?
[0:06:53] <%walternatorz> she isn't closer to apprehending the thief
[0:06:57] <@SoFarFetched> it was the butterfly I tell you,the butterfly!
[0:07:01] <dr_sweets> FFXIV Genocide run
[0:07:09] <%HollowBeansVG> why are you murder all these firefly
[0:07:09] <calzonewithextracheese> why is your map so big??
[0:07:09] <%Chichen> Paige you dont have to fight these btw
[0:07:10] <+Quaraezha> Odin is both a hard trial and a FATE
[0:07:11] <OneThousandTomatoes> @dakuu75 not completely randomly but kinda
[0:07:11] <%walternatorz> do skeletons look like egg thieves?
[0:07:19] <$Sphincter_Spelunker> Paige atpCap
[0:07:19] <+SWFanatic> i'd imagine it would be quite impossible to stab a firefly with a lance
[0:07:19] <%JenovasPuppet> @Dakuu75 Basically. Rare FATE boss.
[0:07:22] <+Quaraezha> The FATE Odin takes up the appearance of the person who deals the last blow the last time it spawns
[0:07:24] <SanguineSkull> Damn Skeleton Warriors.
[0:07:24] <%Chichen> @PeachSaliva you dont have to fight these
[0:07:24] <+bahiti> @relikanox ah cool. that i did not know
[0:07:25] <%walternatorz> she won't stop murdering the skeletons
[0:07:25] <dr_sweets> Skeletons love eggs
[0:07:26] <%nip_nips> paige the skelmetons are not the ocncern
[0:07:30] <+Quaraezha> But nobody notices this
[0:07:34] <OneThousandTomatoes> if he shows up you would know
[0:07:42] <%Dakuu75> oh, he's a FATE. and do you get cool shit for beating him?
[0:07:45] <OneThousandTomatoes> mostly by people shouting in in-game chat
[0:07:46] <+FingaLights> Magicked is a word?
[0:07:47] <metboy_pully> If she's enjoying the fighting, does it matter?
[0:07:48] <%walternatorz> skeletons are just experience??
[0:07:49] <%TheWinged7> poor firefly
[0:07:56] <OneThousandTomatoes> @dakuu75 yes
[0:08:00] <$Sphincter_Spelunker> @PeachSaliva Yellow means they're not hostile until YOU attack them 1st
[0:08:02] <$skizzuto> I remember this quest, the objective is actually outside and above the dungeon she's in rn
[0:08:03] <%nip_nips> back to the surface
[0:08:04] <+MarkoTolstov> they respawn forever LUL
[0:08:09] <+SWFanatic> psaBlind
[0:08:11] <%JenovasPuppet> @Dakuu75 If you get the final hit, you BECOME Odin! The next time he spawns, your character model will be the one on the horse.
[0:08:27] <%Chichen> Follow the horse paige
[0:08:32] <%nip_nips> BACK ON THE SURFACE
[0:08:34] <%SveriSageAdvice> thief is on surface, outside

[0:08:45] <+Timmeh_L> above ground
[0:08:46] <calzonewithextracheese> maybe zoom out a bit so you can see stuff better? unless you dont wanna
[0:08:50] <JanusII> Paige always did want to be part of a skeleton train.
[0:08:52] <Monkeyweed21> go outsided
[0:08:53] <%dankjerri> THE ROOF
[0:09:02] <@SoFarFetched> cant follow the horse when everyone has HUGE mounts LUL

[0:10:47] <%Anonymasque> I beat ARR and I'm still confused!
[0:10:50] <Monkeyweed21> now you get to kill humans
[0:10:52] <@SoFarFetched> and can block things
[0:10:54] <%ahomeschooldropout> Paige got like 15 people following her and it's really funny

[0:11:28] <CzeekyTV> It's pretty annoying when people park their big mounts right in her camera
[0:11:34] <$skizzuto> The dude you're stabbing is getting healed, might want to focus the healer first
[0:11:48] <Dopamien> its fine calebKek
[0:11:48] <@SoFarFetched> Yeah its why I go small mount. Not too big of a distraction.

[0:14:02] <+PenmanLupine> you still won but its better to kill the healer first so the bosses can be easier/faster
[0:14:02] <+FunkyStreams> fuckin chocobitch

[0:14:30] <+FingaLights> tbf I didn't even see the healer
[0:14:31] <%JenovasPuppet> True. They can't handle Peach at her full potential, so she gave them a handicap.

[0:15:01] <+FingaLights> @ComfortableStranger ye
[0:15:08] <%Kenzo2000> "How can we increase the egg content of our game?"
[0:15:09] <$JoshManVGH> I guess we'll just make all the quests about eggs
[0:15:15] <%ComfortableStranger> @FingaLights o i see
[0:15:17] <%JenovasPuppet> The best part of every easter event is seeing what new egg puns they'll come up with.
[0:15:22] <+FunkyStreams> weird

[0:17:34] <+wizard_of_diamonds> I've always loved the vaguely French/Creole/Fantasy naming scheme with the Eorean NPCs. Its a memorable feature of the setting.
[0:17:40] <%Kenzo2000> @DrkJP520 I think it's more that we just happen to hang out with people who can see them almost exclusively
[0:17:43] <stoic_nod> We don't talk about the elephant in the room.
[0:17:51] <jetpack_rorschasch> Father! I require sustenance!
[0:17:55] <+wizard_of_diamonds> The lighting looks so fucked in Fog weather
[0:18:32] <+RelikaNox> Paige, if you go to the NPC with a sprout over his head to your right, you'll get a set of missions teaching you combat basics
[0:18:33] <+SWFanatic> it is done
[0:18:39] <pogo_hobo> elf mommy
[0:18:44] <%ComfortableStranger> big and strong!
[0:18:51] <%nip_nips> shes like half a dozen quests from the first dungeon i think
[0:18:57] <+wizard_of_diamonds> THE TWINS
[0:18:59] <Monkeyweed21> @RelikaNox best time to do those would be right before satasha
[0:19:02] <JanusII> The twins in the background.
[0:19:05] <+wizard_of_diamonds> MY BABIES ;-;
[0:19:08] <%JenovasPuppet> KILL THE TREE
[0:19:14] <pogo_hobo> oh crap I never noticed them here before

[0:20:23] <%dankjerri> DAAAAAAAAYUUUUM
[0:20:27] <+Quaraezha> Pat............
[0:20:37] <%Kenzo2000> Pat's waving back at a woman who was waving at someone next to him
[0:20:46] <%Dakuu75> it's like when someone waves, and yout hink it's for you... but it was for someone behind you
[0:20:47] <jetpack_rorschasch> You're ALWAYS beautiful Pat, don't listen to her.
[0:20:52] <+alphonseisbest> stream does some little stuttering
[0:20:53] <%dankjerri> pat's WHM fit looks like a nomura design
[0:20:54] <$Sphincter_Spelunker> @Kenzo2000 oof
[0:21:23] <%JenovasPuppet> Oh wow, I had no idea Miounne's body piece was unique to her.
[0:21:27] <+Prism_Zet> yooo you came back! lol
[0:21:42] <+SWFanatic> Speak Freely: "Get Bent."
[0:21:44] <$Sphincter_Spelunker> what a dork
[0:21:51] <+Goraka91> @JenovasPuppet Yeah couple NPCs have that, like Momodi's headpiece
[0:22:11] <Valdorick> The race war STARTS NOOOOOOW
[0:22:16] <+SWFanatic> Shit just got real
[0:22:23] <OneThousandTomatoes> I like npc's having unique stuff
[0:22:47] <+Goraka91> Well yes but how are we going to make Cosplay NPCs like that? LUL
[0:22:50] <+SWFanatic> You ever throw your lance in the air and yell "Ahhh!" ?
[0:22:51] <OneThousandTomatoes> around there
[0:23:01] <%SveriSageAdvice> eyyy she got it
[0:23:05] <%Chichen> paige you might want to grab your job quest too
[0:23:10] <Monkeyweed21> dont forget your Lancer  quest

[0:23:20] <$skizzuto> Paige you have over a million gil
[0:23:22] <@Jekado> yeah... 105 gil...
[0:23:26] <%dankjerri> CHOCOBOS
[0:23:26] <%Ranryu692> Paige you're a millionaire
[0:23:26] <+scrublordsamurai> hows itgoing in the land of MMORPG land
[0:23:28] <Monkeyweed21> taxes
[0:23:30] <%Kenzo2000> The travel authority
[0:23:32] <@Jekado> Allagans?
[0:23:33] <@SoFarFetched> oh god stream
[0:23:35] <+FunkyStreams> ope
[0:23:38] <+bytex678> pat sent her money didn't he
[0:23:39] <@Jekado> who even made the network?
[0:23:45] <%Chichen> your stream lagged the same moment your call lagged out @PeachSaliva
[0:23:47] <AdmiralButtloaf> also gards
[0:23:47] <%dankjerri> the aetheryte union
[0:23:48] <+FunkyStreams> Sounds like Pat is talking to your from an airport terminal
[0:23:51] <+Goraka91> Aetherites are coin operated
[0:23:51] <$Sphincter_Spelunker> it's a toll
[0:23:52] <JanusII> Yeah it's taxes.
[0:23:52] <OneThousandTomatoes> toll roads
[0:23:54] <@JustinianKnight> uh yeah
[0:23:56] <@JustinianKnight> Garleans
[0:23:57] <rekinom> If you group Pat you'd have free teleports I think? @PeachSaliva
[0:24:00] <JanusII> Yeah.
[0:24:01] <SpaceCapnCrone> they all live in Limsa Lominsa
[0:24:05] <OneThousandTomatoes> like players?
[0:24:08] <Scamsy> i would join the eorza IRS
[0:24:09] <%walternatorz> no up
[0:24:09] <metboy_pully> Not up
[0:24:12] <+maskedriderhero> Roads are for losers
[0:24:13] <JanusII> You can take your mount everywhere and not teleport.
[0:24:16] <%HollowBeansVG> no up
[0:24:17] <%SveriSageAdvice> oh no not up
[0:24:18] <+RelikaNox> No no
[0:24:19] <%nip_nips> no follow stream
[0:24:21] <%walternatorz> don't go up
[0:24:22] <%SveriSageAdvice> Paige passed it
[0:24:24] <Monkeyweed21> The real answer is that MMO players can create infinite money by killing shit and selling items so you need money sinks to curb inflation
[0:24:25] <%Dakuu75> yeah~! Malboro country
[0:24:27] <metboy_pully> south on the ground.
[0:24:27] <jorniev> is it the pirates or the merchant potatoes?
[0:24:27] <buddhistmetal> go down follow stream
[0:24:27] <+Prism_Zet> fight that swarm of bugs
[0:24:28] <+VStan11> NO
[0:24:29] <%nip_nips> if you go up you go wrong way
[0:24:36] <OneThousandTomatoes> I never pay aetheryte taxes
[0:24:38] <+bytex678> does Pat have a reverb effect or is his voice just that booming
[0:24:41] <%Kenzo2000> You don't go up there until like lvl 28
[0:24:51] <%walternatorz> follow river south
[0:25:03] <+Goraka91> You go around there's like a crevasse thing
[0:25:13] <jorniev> not this stream that stream
[0:25:16] <buddhistmetal> it's confusing
[0:25:19] <%Chichen> NO, its super confusing for early players
[0:25:20] <$Sphincter_Spelunker> a little of both
[0:25:20] <+wizard_of_diamonds> Nah, reading maps is a skill, no joke
[0:25:20] <%SveriSageAdvice> THIS is just a confusing area
[0:25:24] <jorniev> ITS ALL NEW STUFF of course its confusing
[0:25:27] <%CyborgAV> Yeah it takes some getting used to
[0:25:28] <@SoFarFetched> the map has confused me still in some places
[0:25:30] <$Sphincter_Spelunker> I mean bolth
[0:25:31] <%SveriSageAdvice> i have been lost here too many times
[0:25:31] <%Kenzo2000> you keep using the zoomed out map without the markers on it
[0:25:35] <+maskedriderhero> Its confusing for someone whose new to all this.  The Black Shroud can be very much a maze
[0:25:36] <+bytex678> alot of these areas are very confusing. specially later
[0:25:37] <OneThousandTomatoes> honestly, gridania is really confusing
[0:25:42] <+forebringer> Paige picking fights with slugs
[0:25:47] <+Goraka91> At least it's not 1.0 Gridania eh?
[0:25:48] <%juxtest> Its not really confusing, but its not in an area you would ever go to except for this quest
[0:25:49] <OneThousandTomatoes> sometimes cliffs
[0:25:50] <JanusII> I love Gridania though. leaflitLul
[0:25:53] <metboy_pully> It's confusing until you get used to the area, and have been to the tree like 5 times for the white mage quests.
[0:25:56] <+bytex678> limsa lominsa is the worst city for me i can't find anything there
[0:25:59] <%miabyte> doing gathering quests and I want to poke my eyes out, fortunately this stream is keeping me sane
[0:26:01] <luftraumm1> o/ o/ o/
[0:26:04] <Monkeyweed21> @PeachSaliva this was my sisters first MMO and she had the same problems until she was past level 50
[0:26:08] <JanusII> I think Limsa is worse in town tbh.
[0:26:15] <jorniev> is she gonna fight that one douche
[0:26:18] <+FunkyStreams> Pat's crazy talk ahs screwed us all over, once again.
[0:26:19] <%dankjerri> shoulda got her to do a caster and watch her interrupt herself by mkving3 for a solid 5 minutes
[0:26:27] <metboy_pully> I'm doing the cooking quests while I watch
[0:26:30] <$Sphincter_Spelunker> Scalies. Time for murder
[0:26:36] <%Dakuu75> Yagudo were better birds~
[0:26:39] <+wizard_of_diamonds> For ARR they arguably made the maps too organic, making them hard to parse. After they're a tad more artificial, but also more sensible to read
[0:26:39] <OneThousandTomatoes> Squawk yall
[0:26:42] <jorniev> oooooh i like how these dudes look
[0:26:44] <%juxtest> How come the Elementals never fuck these guys up
[0:26:48] <+wizard_of_diamonds> With some exceptions LUL
[0:26:50] <+DeRedBaron> funny thing is i find new and old gridania more easier to navigate excpt that they dont have a aetherite directly to the shop district
[0:26:55] <+SWFanatic> they love it
[0:26:55] <SpaceCapnCrone> @Dakuu75 truth
[0:27:02] <+bytex678> is there a way to remove the endwalker banner or is it on her side?
[0:27:03] <%Reaped_Psyche> Garuda = Windy dommy mommy.
[0:27:05] <+FunkyStreams> Because, sometimes we take Pat's talk to be real. But, it really not real.
[0:27:07] <OneThousandTomatoes> @juxtest idk elementals don't do shit
[0:27:15] <$Sphincter_Spelunker> @bytex678 blocking chat
[0:27:15] <OneThousandTomatoes> except when they do
[0:27:16] <@JustinianKnight> yea Yagudo were pretty cool
[0:27:22] <%Dakuu75> @bytex678 it's her thing, just to cover chat-box
[0:27:23] <+RelikaNox> @bytex678 It's on her side, it's a thing FFXIV streamers do to block their chat box
[0:27:26] <+bytex678> ohhhh i see
[0:27:28] <OneThousandTomatoes> But other then then
[0:27:30] <luftraumm1> @peachsaliva can you use a twang in your Reading?  love your voice
[0:27:31] <+bytex678> makes sense
[0:27:39] <SpaceCapnCrone> The Elementals are super weak from the Calamity according to in-game sources
[0:27:42] <OneThousandTomatoes> *than then
[0:27:45] <+Goraka91> @bytex678 It's just to cover the chat LUL
[0:27:46] <SpaceCapnCrone> they made the forest come alive and eat dudes in 1.0
[0:27:55] <+bytex678> we don't need to see all the weird PMs she gets xD

[0:30:26] <luftraumm1> ass stabbing is your life
[0:30:30] <metboy_pully> There's a reason the normal approach is 'tank and spank'
[0:30:38] <+RoByte2> Lots of ass stabbing, and then some from the side
[0:30:39] <%SuperBloodWolfMoon> NPCs have massive HP, feel free to let them tank for you.
[0:30:40] <+bytex678> you spank, they tank
[0:30:55] <+wizard_of_diamonds> Paige for the love of Go d look around
[0:30:59] <%Dakuu75> I wonder if you could pull a Malboro down here? lol
[0:31:01] <+wizard_of_diamonds> LUL
