[0:00:19] <freelancebabymaker> well im never this early so i guess that makes sense
[0:00:26] <Madovir> it's been her offline screen for as long as I can remember
[0:00:42] <hairtoday> worth keeping around, that art is rad
[0:00:49] <freelancebabymaker> it really is
[0:01:07] <%MarylandJutsu> Its time for Unnamed King right?
[0:01:11] <%optimasmaximas> nameless king yeyeyeye
[0:01:26] <%MarylandJutsu> oh yeah nameless
[0:01:33] <freelancebabymaker> itll be great for whenever she does her bloodborne replay
[0:01:34] <%MarylandJutsu> forgot title....phew its been a hot minute since i played 3
[0:01:36] <%KeiganOfAstora> Yoooooooooooo
[0:01:37] <legion0047> how much is paige going to hate ariendel and the puppers should we get there?
[0:02:00] <%KeiganOfAstora> She's gonna get lost in Ariendel
[0:02:02] <%KeiganOfAstora> Ariandel*
[0:02:10] <freelancebabymaker> oh shes gonna get so lost
[0:02:15] <%thejimjamz> HAHA TIME FOR BIG AND STRONG
[0:03:01] <+the_mental_punk> How’s everyone doing?
[0:03:03] <%Zeif00> PogChamp PogChamp
[0:03:13] <%levimonstapaws> Need this to cheer up..... RIP Trevor Moore
[0:03:19] <%Raikouija> Time for the Dank Souls
[0:03:25] <freelancebabymaker> if she makes it to friede tonight i expect tears
[0:03:30] <armchairmaster_> Hey Paige, I don't see an achievement for you completing Dark Souls 3, did you complete it yet LUL
[0:03:46] <%Raikouija> Question tho, has paige ever thought about playing Sekiro?
[0:03:57] <freelancebabymaker> she has
[0:03:58] <%SveriSageAdvice> she and pat said no
[0:04:05] <freelancebabymaker> but it might be too much for her wrists
[0:04:05] <%SveriSageAdvice> the reflexes required she's unable to do
[0:04:14] <+Anderobot> No way in hell she reaches Friede in one night
[0:04:15] <freelancebabymaker> like bayonetta was
[0:04:18] <heavenxfalls22> Hi chat
[0:04:18] <+the_mental_punk> yeah it would destroy her hands as well
[0:04:22] <%Raikouija> Oof
[0:04:31] <%MarylandJutsu> YE YE HERE WE GO
[0:04:33] <%Raikouija> True cause Sekiro is just a parry game
[0:04:39] <freelancebabymaker> apparently theres a mod that makes it more accessible?
[0:04:47] <%SveriSageAdvice> the game would absolutely be her jam, but it requires way too much that her body wont allow
[0:04:54] <GarbageQueenEllie> Brrmp brrrmp brrrrmp brrrdrrrrdrrdrrr
[0:05:04] <+the_mental_punk> Idk what it is but I couldn’t get into sekiro. There was something about the combat that wouldn’t click for me
[0:05:05] <boomstickery> a hold for parry would make that game fun for a lot of people
[0:05:20] <%Ziegsy> are we ready to check for bees?
[0:05:44] <%thejimjamz> We're ready to shake the bag
[0:05:55] <freelancebabymaker> i am ready for TORTURE
[0:06:00] <@SoFarFetched> SoFarFetched subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 25 months, currently on a 25 month streak! Just wanna say I had so much fun with the birthday stream I ended up with a headache for the rest of the night from dying of laughter so hard. The party games were really fun!  geefSmush
[0:06:06] <%Zeif00> woop woop
[0:06:11] <%MarylandJutsu> @SoFarFetched hope you are having a good saturday far
[0:06:11] <%FacetiousAF> FacetiousAF subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 14 months! deep breaths. but literally i have no other advice for this, its a motherfucker
[0:06:31] <grotto_kein> Dark Souls 3 rhymes with Dark Souls pee
[0:06:33] <@SoFarFetched> @MarylandJutsu geefPeep oh thank you,my Saturday's been pretty good. Hope yours has been!
[0:06:35] <+the_mental_punk> She’s improved so much it’s honestly amazing seeing her burn through this game.
[0:06:44] <freelancebabymaker> @FacetiousAF yeah hes really just like do the fight until you figure it out
[0:07:00] <freelancebabymaker> @FacetiousAF and that seems to upset the paige sometimes
[0:07:02] <%MarylandJutsu> @SoFarFetched ye ye! i had work off on friday cause borfday on monday so three day weekend!!! its been all about chilling
[0:07:22] <freelancebabymaker> but she really has improved so much its kinda nuts
[0:07:47] <+the_mental_punk> Is it the vtuber that unlocked her true potential
[0:07:58] <freelancebabymaker> oh god i think it is
[0:07:59] <@SoFarFetched> @MarylandJutsu I hope you have a good Birthday weekend! geefHug 3 day weekends are nice.
[0:08:08] <%MarylandJutsu> I feel like paige is a bumble queen, shes bumbles through it but when she's got it? BY GEORGE shes GOT IT
[0:08:13] <+the_mental_punk> That’s literally when the skill increase happened
[0:08:30] <%MarylandJutsu> thanks Far! yeah i was hoping to get monday but it got snatched by a coworker so shrug
[0:08:38] <%Raikouija> I’m gonna lose my shit when she bumbles through elden ring
[0:08:39] <+the_mental_punk> Paige did not bumble through the last half of this game. I think she legit did it
[0:08:49] <%KeiganOfAstora> Cheer500 @PeachSaliva Good evening. Good luck with Nameless King and the DLC! So I recently started toying with the idea of nail polish. What colors do you think would look nice on a man's nails? Also, any tips since I'm gonna try doing it myself too
[0:09:07] <%MarylandJutsu> @the_mental_punk oh yeah I mean the first half though, once shes got it? it clicks
[0:09:10] <blue8moon> @the_mental_punk I think she's just not distracted by pat in these streams, since she's been in her office LUL
[0:09:12] <NoHoldsBarredProductions> Go Paige go! Happy belated birthday!
[0:09:45] <freelancebabymaker> yeah not having pat next to her really helps for whatever reason
[0:10:00] <legion0047> @peachsaliva So i have been staying up late to say this but you can commision a controller for your Vtuber that actually matches what you do in real live. This way we can see you mash as well as hear it.
[0:10:03] <%MarylandJutsu> and yet at least once a stream there WILL be a PATTTTUHHHH
[0:10:08] <+Shady_Zaku> eyyyyyyy
[0:10:09] <freelancebabymaker> its those orb vapors
[0:10:16] <freelancebabymaker> YEYE
[0:10:17] <%MarylandJutsu> ITS TIME
[0:10:20] <zeekayart> happy belated!!!!!
[0:10:20] <+the_mental_punk> @blue8moon she definitely has a lot more focus on her own. It’s like pat was the rock lee training weights (photoshop idea)
[0:10:20] <%Ziegsy> YEYEYE
[0:10:24] <legion0047> She probably stoped trying to get help from him for everything
[0:10:26] <%hewlettfan96> yeyey

[0:12:46] <freelancebabymaker> no
[0:12:47] <BigFingerRo> @freelancebabymaker Hammor seems exceedingly good for bosses, but shit for exploration

[0:13:36] <PhantonBat> You know it's bad when you're watching Paige over Pat
[0:13:41] <%thejimjamz> Side effect from killing the lady last stream psaMenace

[0:24:48] <%hewlettfan96> ELMO Is panicking
[0:24:51] <legion0047> as those are generally better than the main game
[0:24:52] <$Sphincter_Spelunker> elmo says "pay attention to me"
[0:24:57] <BigFingerRo> See? Elmo breaks shit as he's taught to by his parents
[0:24:58] <%Ziegsy> I have psoriasis, nail varnish completely thins my nails and makes them super weak. I wish I could wear some ;;

[0:28:01] <+Dirty_Dandere> Will she be able to do this without her big and strong model?
[0:28:02] <$Sphincter_Spelunker> like Vegeta

[0:34:26] <poisin224> f
[0:34:27] <%thejimjamz> Place your bets chat
[0:34:29] <%KeiganOfAstora> FIGHT THE CAMERA NOT THE BOSS
[0:34:31] <Coystick> His hands are on your balls

[0:34:38] <%JoshManVGH> Birb rider showed his spear instead.
[0:34:40] <Good_Snacks> Oh god you're fighting The Nameless King. Good luck, Paige!!
[0:34:46] <%optimasmaximas> midirs harder
[0:34:46] <+the_mental_punk> Little greedy but good rolls
[0:34:49] <%Raikouija> Off to a rolicking start
[0:34:50] <BigFingerRo> The hardest VANILLA boss
[0:34:52] <%Chichen> I cant believe Zangief drew a better hand turkey than paige
[0:34:52] <Bonkus_Maximus_> dog finger painting sounds rad
[0:34:53] <shotgang86> And that's how 95% of the fights when you first meet this thing
[0:34:55] <%JoshManVGH> We believe in you!
[0:34:56] <+Dirty_Dandere> camera is the real boss
[0:34:57] <%Puhff> yeah Nameless King fucks, he's my favorite boss
[0:34:59] <inorwise> i mean you dont have to
[0:35:05] <rizintaco> Yeah, that's fair. I had more trouble with him then Big G
[0:35:07] <Mr_JustinJones> sister friede is up there as well
[0:35:08] <%freelancebabymaker> @BigFingerRo its like that simpsons joke lmao
[0:35:09] <+the_mental_punk> He is not the hardest but that is also up to opinion
[0:35:13] <PhantonBat> Knowing Paige's luck she'll get it in like 3 attempts
[0:35:13] <BigFingerRo> let's not be too hasty and underestimate Gael
[0:35:15] <DXLelouch24> I coming Patttttttttt
[0:35:17] <Magicferret> Don't worry some of the dlc bosses are harder
[0:35:18] <%femto216> For me is Midir
[0:35:19] <DXLelouch24> Incoming*
[0:35:20] <%Grimlockfly> the lock on is just messing you up, it's not really necessary, hitting the birds feet is valid.
[0:35:21] <BigFingerRo> or dare I say MIDIR
[0:35:23] <+Zteck123> He's the hardest cause no one wants to put in for a great shield
[0:35:27] <boomstickery> so who is this guy lorewise? unless thats DLC spoilers
[0:35:31] <Coystick> You can always start the ashes DLC, ease into some PVE content
[0:35:35] <%KeiganOfAstora> Nameless King and Midir are both Camera Bosses
[0:35:35] <Good_Snacks> There is no shame in skipping Nameless King.
[0:35:39] <BigFingerRo> PEACHES, IF YOU GIVE UP HERE, THE DLCS WILL MAKE YOU SHRIVEL
[0:35:42] <%cureneckbeard> Nameless King sucks. I only fight bosses with names
[0:35:43] <%Grimlockfly> @boomstickery who he is is the biggest spolilers
[0:35:44] <+McSoliace> its way harder from here paige
[0:35:45] <benjiFG> the rolls
[0:35:46] <%topendbuzza> thanks lockon
[0:35:49] <legion0047> This is the only boss of the game i had to sleep over, so fun
[0:35:57] <VritraReiRei> didnt Pat sort of Cheese this boss with the Uchigatana cause it was so broken at the time?

[0:36:10] <rizintaco> Sis was hard but I learned that I just treat dad like a room mechanic and not a target and it was a little easier.
[0:36:10] <kipperxl> music kinda sounds like there's some feller with a leafblower in the backyard LUL
[0:36:10] <%freelancebabymaker> @boomstickery lore after she beats it usually
[0:36:11] <@commanderclaw> I feel like Paige has depth perception issues with this game. She's always swinging when they're too far away
[0:36:13] <%thejimjamz> that damage, sheesh
[0:36:15] <+zamatermort> You have to HIT HIM WOOLIE
[0:36:17] <shotgang86> Play without the lock on, hit its legs
[0:36:17] <Panda_Boxer> I had to summon allies for this boss
[0:36:18] <peachy996> Nameless King is tough but if you want you can run through the first DLC for a bit if you feel like you've hit a wall
[0:36:23] <iinsectaa> Try locking onto him instead of drake, it helps a little bit imp
[0:36:25] <%JenovasPuppet> Birb must die!
[0:36:33] <$Sphincter_Spelunker> @commanderclaw it's called not having glasses
[0:36:33] <zeekayart> game starts: instantly swears instead of chatting 🤣🤣
[0:36:34] <%KeiganOfAstora> ONE SWING
[0:36:35] <%JenovasPuppet> Destroy that muppet!
[0:36:40] <BinaryBetrayer> @VritraReiRei He also grinded all of the levels
[0:36:41] <%Raikouija> SHE DO IT
[0:36:42] <%Puhff> oof nice depth perception
[0:36:42] <%thejimjamz> Kill the birb, ironmouse would be proud!
[0:36:43] <%JoshManVGH> Can you bonk legs?
[0:36:44] <%KeiganOfAstora> Yea that'll get you every time
[0:36:45] <%MarylandJutsu> BALLS IN ASS
[0:36:47] <%freelancebabymaker> yeah that fire is big
[0:36:48] <jsbrand115> Great attempt!
[0:36:51] <%Sotetsu> You can't give up, you're Paige!
[0:36:51] <poisin224> you were doing really well though
[0:36:52] <GarbageQueenEllie> So close
[0:36:52] <zeekayart> bahahahah
[0:36:56] <DXLelouch24> If you give up here Paige the DLC will bitchslap you off the proverbial Dark Souls cliff. Especislly *** dont play.
[0:36:56] <%hewlettfan96> he's the hardest because his attack patterns are near unpredictable every single time you play him, whilst all other bosses have specific patterns the nameless king pretty much changes his attacks with each reiteration
[0:36:56] <+the_mental_punk> @peachsaliva the birds head can be staggered where you can get a blood borne style visceral attack, if that helps.
[0:36:57] <SMuffinMan> @joshmanvgh for like 5 dmg
[0:36:58] <BigFingerRo> @JoshManVGH But then UNGA BUNGA
[0:36:58] <shotgang86> that was good.
[0:36:59] <$SinisterBroccoli> gotta stay calm for this guy
[0:37:00] <%Chichen> @PeachSaliva getting up early means you get hit faster. Staying down means more iframes. Sometimes pressing nothing is better
[0:37:01] <zeekayart> that's dark souls for ya
[0:37:01] <%Raikouija> F
[0:37:05] <%Ziegsy> Ive been farming velkhana in monhun stories 2 and that bird is giving me ptsd
[0:37:05] <%Puhff> that was bad
[0:37:05] <Panda_Boxer> he's gonna fuck your balls and steal your wife
[0:37:07] <DXLelouch24> First DLC
[0:37:08] <%topendbuzza> I would if I could
[0:37:09] <%KeiganOfAstora> One swing at a time then roll. You can get the bird easily
[0:37:10] <BigFingerRo> SUUUUCK EVERY NUT THAT I HAAAAAVE
[0:37:11] <%Grimlockfly> Stop chasing his head, outside of obviuos hits, you can hit his feet twoo
[0:37:15] <%CptCreampuff16> HIT I HARD
[0:37:15] <%KeiganOfAstora> Walk up to the head and hit R1
[0:37:16] <inorwise> your doing really good damage on the plus side
[0:37:19] <%freelancebabymaker> just do a lot of damage i think
[0:37:23] <+the_mental_punk> @peachsaliva anytime he flies up just run away as well
[0:37:25] <%JenovasPuppet> You bunga'd when you should've unga'd
[0:37:30] <fiveseviien> hit it until it dies
[0:37:31] <%Grimlockfly> once he flies away RUN, cuz fire coming down directly
[0:37:31] <%Chichen> hitting the feet does almost 0 damage
[0:37:32] <Coystick> FEET
[0:37:33] <%freelancebabymaker> it plays an animation and then you can press r1 i think?
[0:37:34] <GarbageQueenEllie> Sing that french bird plucking song for morale
[0:37:36] <+Mumbles519> His feet take way less damage though
[0:37:37] <Eightesu> Isn't the armor youre wearing not very resistant against fire and lightinging?
[0:37:39] <%Chichen> @PeachSaliva hitting the feet does almost 0 damage
[0:37:41] <+Top_Lane_Duelist> head is big dmg though
[0:37:42] <rizintaco> Chat is always going after feet
[0:37:50] <DXLelouch24> @peachsaliva the dlcs EVEN HARDER,so you must unlock Ultra Instinct
[0:37:50] <+the_mental_punk> Being under him though causes the fire attack more often
[0:37:52] <%KeiganOfAstora> Armor doesn't matter
[0:37:57] <benjiFG> armor barely matters in ds3
[0:37:57] <inorwise> paaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaat
[0:38:04] <rizintaco> I played fast 1 handers, can she actually do damage to feet?
[0:38:07] <+Zteck123> I wish it did
[0:38:10] <+Top_Lane_Duelist> feet bad head good
[0:38:11] <Eightesu> it's boreal valley armor i imagine it's good against ice and stuff just my guess
[0:38:17] <SMuffinMan> @rizintaco Like 10 dmg
[0:38:22] <%Dirty_Dandere> Dirty_Dandere subscribed with Prime. 
[0:38:22] <%KeiganOfAstora> SUPER LUCKY

[0:38:29] <+the_mental_punk> Resistance stats are negligible unless you really spec for it
[0:38:29] <%KeiganOfAstora> Frost damage in two hits. You can do this
[0:38:30] <%WhereIsWill> that DAMAGE
[0:38:34] <Panda_Boxer> big damage
[0:38:35] <GarbageQueenEllie> "You are one UGLY-ass bird"
[0:38:35] <+redreymar> ok cool i made it how many attempts are we on chat?

[1:07:52] <%Monkeyweed21> @PeachSaliva you did better on that boss than Pat
[1:07:53] <@PatStaresAt> @PeachSaliva Only thing left to do at DragonPeak is get the ashes from the other side of that last bonfire
[1:07:55] <%KeiganOfAstora> @PeachSaliva Use your embers on bosses. Look how much HP you have now that you're embered
[1:07:59] <+MarkoTolstov> Did she explore the entirety of Peak yet?
[1:07:59] <%thejimjamz> "Please don't call me and kill me for no raison Peach"
[1:08:14] <@PatStaresAt> @PeachSaliva USE EM FUCK IT
[1:08:20] <$Sphincter_Spelunker> @PeachSaliva you don't need any more levels after 40
[1:08:20] <%KeiganOfAstora> There's also some cool armor in that area now
[1:08:22] <%freelancebabymaker> dont you disregard that woman after you KILLED HER LAST STREAM paige
[1:08:23] <+bestefforts> Nameless & a DLC boss are the only ones I ended up needing help with. Congratz on the victory!
[1:08:24] <%KeiganOfAstora> USE ALL THE SOULS
[1:08:25] <%Grimlockfly> read the lore on that king
[1:08:25] <+burntbagels13> Is she doing the DLC now?
[1:08:26] <%Dirty_Dandere> Nope, did not get the rest of the area
[1:08:26] <Coystick> The swordspear is GODLY
[1:08:28] <%freelancebabymaker> YES
[1:08:29] <%KeiganOfAstora> Pat said to
[1:08:29] <@PatStaresAt> @PeachSaliva YEAH YOURE GOOD
[1:08:30] <Wofoeh> Not USE them
[1:08:32] <Wofoeh> CONVERT Them
[1:08:36] <benjiFG> EAT
[1:08:37] <%Monkeyweed21> Nameless King gives you a faith spear and a miracle
[1:08:38] <%Grimlockfly> Read his lore
[1:08:39] <@PatStaresAt> @PeachSaliva EAT EM IF YOU WANT
[1:08:39] <BigYanno> See what you can get
[1:08:41] <+stagemage> read then eat
[1:08:41] <%geekjacob> sword spear is good
[1:08:43] <@MistyMntns> Eat
[1:08:43] <%Ranryu692> OM NOM NOM BUT LORE FIRST
[1:08:46] <%Dirty_Dandere> EAT
[1:08:48] <%thejimjamz> Become even bigger!
[1:08:48] <+UpDownSword> ya
[1:08:50] <@SoFarFetched> DRINK THEM UP geefJuice geefJuice geefJuice
[1:08:51] <+OldDarkwraith> Eat
[1:08:52] <+Cynfos> consume
[1:08:52] <+Mad_Man_Chris> HIS WEAPON IS DOPE AF THOUGH
[1:08:55] <+the_mental_punk> Do you plan on switching weapons?
[1:09:03] <%freelancebabymaker> GWYN JR BABY
[1:09:03] <%JenovasPuppet> You can always get more souls, you can't get infinite boss weapons
[1:09:04] <$Sphincter_Spelunker> ARES
[1:09:07] <K1llingEdge> love the sword spear
[1:09:08] <%KeiganOfAstora> Ornstein's armor is in Archdragon Peak
[1:09:09] <Arweynn> Read then eat
[1:09:09] <@PatStaresAt> He does kissy kiss with dragonz
[1:09:11] <%Grimlockfly> you killed Gwynns son
[1:09:15] <%freelancebabymaker> NO
[1:09:19] <@PatStaresAt> @PeachSaliva Nah just eat em all it matters not
[1:09:21] <%Dirty_Dandere> EAT
[1:09:21] <Will_The_Soulless> If you get the riposte, you need to not be in an attack animation otherwise you just keep doing R1's. Basically when you hear and see them drop stop and wait then R1 there head
[1:09:24] <JobbedBone> but if its a weapon you'll never use..
[1:09:31] <%KeiganOfAstora> What other big hammers are good for Paige?
[1:09:31] <Wofoeh> Twin Prince you get either a fire sword or a MAGIC swortd
[1:09:33] <blue8moon> You originally saved the twin princes because you were considering getting their sword, but that requires NG+
[1:09:36] <%freelancebabymaker> when are you planning on doing that new game plus paige?
[1:09:37] <%Ranryu692> he has said he's sure many times
[1:09:37] <$Sphincter_Spelunker> it suck
[1:09:37] <benjiFG> you can check in with ludleth
[1:09:39] <%KeiganOfAstora> Maybe we try Big Halberds?
[1:09:39] <@PatStaresAt> @PeachSaliva It's his lightning spear that loves miracles
[1:09:46] <+the_mental_punk> You’d probably like the flame sword from princes
[1:09:48] <Wofoeh> Once you get both they'll fuse and make a fire magic sword
[1:09:51] <%JenovasPuppet> Go talk to to the little guy if you want to see the weapons
[1:09:51] <+Yosepmeist> Imagine consuming boss souls for the soft souls that you could farm in 10 min LUL
[1:09:53] <+FennecZephyr> You're going with a STR build, so I dont think the spear matters
[1:10:00] <%geekjacob> you could get a cool fire sword from the prince
[1:10:02] <+the_mental_punk> You wouldn’t use nameless kings sword
[1:10:05] <@PatStaresAt> Yosepmist it doesnt matter in a single serving playthrough
[1:10:06] <+FennecZephyr> Did she eat the wrong soul?
[1:10:17] <+FennecZephyr> Or does it not matter
[1:10:23] <AthenaAegis> Killed the Nameless Fucker faster than I did. Well done
[1:10:31] <+the_mental_punk> We all know what weapon she’ll use from ringed city
[1:10:32] <%LysdexicAndVolingit> @FennecZephyr Doesn't matter; coulda ate both
[1:10:34] <@PatStaresAt> @PeachSaliva other bonfire
[1:10:34] <%Dirty_Dandere> Eating either is fine
[1:10:36] <+hotspur1235> left for a month and see Pat replaced his wife with a anime girl. awesome.
[1:10:37] <%freelancebabymaker> @FennecZephyr barely
[1:10:37] <%KeiganOfAstora> Armor here, ashes somewhere else
[1:10:41] <@PatStaresAt> @PeachSaliva the one you used to fight Nameless with
[1:10:43] <+the_mental_punk> Hey pat
[1:10:43] <%Monkeyweed21> ITEM
[1:10:44] <+Walopoh> Just saw about Trevor Moore passing, that's so sad
[1:10:46] <$SinisterBroccoli> ashes are behind you
[1:10:47] <%Monkeyweed21> psaBlind
[1:10:54] <+realm_forge> I am enjoying a delicious mead right now
[1:10:57] <%KeiganOfAstora> Well that's good to have
[1:10:57] <%Dirty_Dandere> Always forget that
[1:11:05] <%KeiganOfAstora> I think there's some twinkling titanite here too maybe?
[1:11:09] <%Maids4lyfe> oh
[1:11:10] <+thelonechris> F
[1:11:11] <@commanderclaw> Let us all remember him as the man who brought laughter and joy to us
[1:11:14] <%Maids4lyfe> FeelsBadMan
[1:11:15] <%hewlettfan96> he was a gift to humanity
[1:11:16] <+the_mental_punk> There’s an armor set
[1:11:16] <%Monkeyweed21> he got his ass beat to death with a hammer?
[1:11:17] <JobbedBone> BibleThump
[1:11:20] <+Walopoh> He had a wife and son, and was an executive on some Disney Channel shows
[1:11:22] <%king_wragles> @commanderclaw Like Sex Robot
[1:11:24] <$Sphincter_Spelunker> oh, this is how I'm finding out? :(
[1:11:26] <+realm_forge> BibleThump BibleThump BibleThump
[1:11:27] <cherrycottontail> Always remember to do it happier and with your mouth open.
[1:11:27] <%KeiganOfAstora> A really cool armor set
[1:11:33] <+NateyBeak> did they do the ass pennies sketch? that one never leaves my mind
[1:11:35] <%MarylandJutsu> don't hammer my ass!!
[1:11:35] <rizintaco> God, he was only 41.
[1:11:35] <JobbedBone> NOW YOU HAVE FUCKED UP
[1:11:36] <@PatStaresAt> @PeachSaliva The ashes are the other way lol
[1:11:37] <%king_wragles> Like ACTUALLY Sex Robot, that was fucking hilarious
[1:11:38] <%Dirty_Dandere> YE
[1:11:38] <%JenovasPuppet> That set is so nice
[1:11:40] <blue8moon> that's ornstein's stuff
[1:11:44] <+thelonechris> Actually, rest in peace. We lost a very talented individual.
[1:11:48] <%Maids4lyfe> that's Orenstein's armor @PeachSaliva
[1:11:50] <+the_mental_punk> HES HITTING MY BUTT
[1:11:56] <%MarylandJutsu> Don't break my butt
[1:11:57] <%KeiganOfAstora> hahahahahha
[1:11:57] <Wofoeh> @PeachSaliva and Chat, question, if you could pick your last meal before death, what would it be?
[1:11:58] <%Monkeyweed21> aaaaa, aaaa, aaaa
[1:11:59] <%Chichen> you're done here now
[1:12:00] <%hewlettfan96> Rest In peace he was insanely talented
[1:12:00] <@PatStaresAt> @PeachSaliva Go back to the other bonfire

[1:12:00] <%KeiganOfAstora> OTHER BONFIRE
[1:12:01] <+the_mental_punk> DONT HIT MY BUTT
[1:12:04] <blue8moon> the bonfire you used to fight the king

[1:12:05] <%Dirty_Dandere> Like a dog
[1:12:07] <%freelancebabymaker> @PeachSaliva yeah theres a theory that the dragon that the nameless king was riding on was maybe ornstein
[1:12:08] <%Maids4lyfe> IT WAS BEHIND YOU
[1:12:10] <%ahomeschooldropout> Is Fallout 76 good

[1:35:52] <Marakami_Sadaneo> however it's super slow so, useless in PVP
[1:35:52] <%AncelDeLambert> I APPEAR, wattup
[1:35:55] <%JoshManVGH> Has Cinders done anything with this shit yet?
[1:35:56] <susukouhai> JoJo Souls

[1:36:08] <Will_The_Soulless> I really wish these were just a bit faster to actually use properly
[1:36:14] <%EyeFarted> sit again
[1:36:19] <%AncelDeLambert> she has the stone, so she must have sat

[1:36:40] <%Ranryu692> that's my biggest problem with the SoulsBorne series. The cool things I want to use suck :(
[1:36:40] <%AncelDeLambert> cuz when people say that, it's almost always a pvp balance issue
[1:36:45] <Marakami_Sadaneo> LUL
[1:36:46] <ToneBacas> hmm maybe Crestfallen is first on the list. Sorry Paige
[1:36:46] <%JoshManVGH> If the Cinders guy was gonna do anything, tuning this form up should be right up that list

[1:47:42] <%Grimlockfly> TOO FAR
[1:47:45] <RubberFistFight> @freelancebabymaker Wait, they were saying killing Nameless was pointless?
[1:47:46] <+shadowsvrse> damn peachy you really have a attention disorder LOL!

[1:53:48] <sirrice77> oh did she not kill the giant worm? i don't remember
[1:53:50] <BinaryBetrayer> This is where you'd originally have to fight a giant demon flying around and you'd use the ballista to shoot him down, Khalameet Style.
[1:53:57] <fruit_pie_the_magician> The giants are in like, irythill dungeon or something
[1:54:11] <%TheApproachingSnom> Welcome to Demon Ruins. No fun allowed

[1:56:10] <%WhereIsWill> @Mog_3825 couldnt agree more. white pony is life.
[1:56:10] <+Mumbles519> I left for a while, is she looking for the last estus shard before doing the dlc?
[1:56:10] <fruit_pie_the_magician> I walked my ass down here like, basically the same time I went through the catacombs
[1:56:17] <happy_void> this whole area is trash
[1:56:19] <RubberFistFight> @AncelDeLambert I actually got all the way around to that spot from the other side without breaking the floor last time i played through. Not quite sure how.
[1:56:20] <danknugglit> You beat bloodborne

[1:57:10] <%TheApproachingSnom> yeah this area is much better with people to take care of the orbs
[1:57:13] <%KeiganOfAstora> Deftones are good
[1:57:16] <%Dakuu75> this part legit gives EVERYONE trouble
[1:57:17] <BigFingerRo> PEACHES, FOR MY SANITY, TELL ME YOU'RE NOT SWINGING A THIRD TIME BECAUSE YOU CAN'T SEE THEY DIED

[1:58:03] <+lordericter> mmm crunchy bones
[1:58:03] <Will_The_Soulless> wait did she find the thing in here you know the DS1 thing
[1:58:04] <CrimsonFox777> @BigFingerRo It'd still be a big improvement over DS1 where she swung at inanimate statues because she thought they were enemies.
[1:58:11] <+MarkoTolstov> this hammer should instakill these magma slimes lol
[1:58:14] <%KeiganOfAstora> @Will_The_Soulless not yet
[1:58:19] <%freelancebabymaker> @Will_The_Soulless shes not even close to it lol
[1:58:24] <%Dakuu75> Big Chungus

[1:58:27] <satiresatyr> i would have done that too lmfao
[1:58:29] <+the_mental_punk> Is there a boss at the end of of demon ruins, I don’t remember
[1:58:31] <BoxNavy> its your old friends
[1:58:34] <Will_The_Soulless> haha perfect
[1:58:34] <DancesWitBalrog> This has been obvious since the orginial Bloodborne stream, but Piage is really good at Souls games
[1:58:34] <%KeiganOfAstora> Do you remember what those things are?
[1:58:34] <CandyCoatedConfection> these statues look constipated
[1:58:35] <blue8moon> you met all these guys before, back in DS1
[1:58:36] <+MisterAvry> you know that guy
[1:58:38] <%Chichen> look familiar?
[1:58:39] <%freelancebabymaker> wow look at all this lack of lore lol
[1:58:39] <danknugglit> Look at those nerds
[1:58:41] <RubberFistFight> @Will_The_Soulless she only just got here, since apparently earlier people were yelling that it's stupid and pointless. True to form, there are now people saying this area sucks and is stupid and pointless.
[1:58:42] <medril07> the hero's of the past
[1:58:46] <%king_wragles> @PeachSaliva do you remember those guys? They're bosses you fought in Dark Souls 1
[1:58:46] <$Sphincter_Spelunker> atpCap
[1:58:49] <%Chichen> DS1 bosses
[1:58:49] <BoxNavy> :) ...
[1:58:51] <BinaryBetrayer> Dark Souls 1 bosses
[1:58:54] <+MisterAvry> get your souls!
[1:58:58] <%KeiganOfAstora> NotLikeThis NotLikeThis NotLikeThis
[1:58:58] <ToneBacas> this is like the demon museum
[1:58:59] <BoxNavy> stray and taurus demon
[1:59:00] <BigFingerRo> @CrimsonFox777 Yeah, I suppose if I were asked if I'd rather cut off a finger or my whole hand, I'd rather lose a finger
[1:59:02] <%freelancebabymaker> lord
[1:59:06] <benjiFG> nice
[1:59:09] <%king_wragles> They're demons
[1:59:15] <satiresatyr> nice pubby
[1:59:17] <%Dakuu75> Why did the fake-flame only make like... 4 types of demons?
[1:59:22] <Will_The_Soulless> @RubberFistFight whattttt thats stupid, I love all the little callbacks and lore bits
[1:59:34] <tanarath> This has ex-bf vibes.
[1:59:36] <RubberFistFight> @Dakuu75 made more, these are just the ones that are left over.
[1:59:38] <%freelancebabymaker> @Dakuu75 cuz izalith got hacked to pieces during development lol
[1:59:46] <$Sphincter_Spelunker> @Dakuu75 the dev in-universe ran out of time
[1:59:46] <%Ranryu692> OHKOI
[1:59:52] <%Ranryu692> oops\
[1:59:54] <%Dakuu75> XD
[1:59:54] <%freelancebabymaker> @Dakuu75 at least thats partly why
[1:59:57] <DancesWitBalrog> gotta love Paige's extra hits after enemy deaths
[2:00:00] <Gregorhasjoined> lol funny orb demon
[2:00:02] <fruit_pie_the_magician> The area is fine, but the lore is unimportant at best
[2:00:02] <CrimsonFox777> @Dakuu75 Fire isn't known for being creative
[2:00:05] <%Ranryu692> that corpse had an item
[2:00:07] <+the_mental_punk> @dakuu75 because the flame only is so much budget from the devs
[2:00:08] <$Quack_of_Dawn> This smoldering cave is all that remains of Izalith
[2:00:14] <%JenovasPuppet> There's an illusory wall back down that other hallway
[2:00:15] <RubberFistFight> @RubberFistFight Remember, people knocked Dark Souls 3 for "calling back to dark souls 1 too much", after ripping on Dark Souls 2 for "not being linked to the first game enough".
[2:00:17] <BigFingerRo> @DancesWitBalrog I fear for my sanity
[2:00:24] <RubberFistFight> People are fucking whiners when it comes to souls, I've found.
[2:00:35] <%JenovasPuppet> It's kind of far back now
[2:00:35] <BoxNavy> over there
[2:00:36] <%Puhff> up ypur butt
[2:00:36] <%Ranryu692> L shaped hallway
[2:00:40] <benjiFG> it's not worth it right now, the way you were going had a bonfire
[2:00:45] <%KeiganOfAstora> And that's that
[2:00:56] <DancesWitBalrog> @bigfingerro she has done this in EVERY souls game. if it aint broke
[2:00:56] <%freelancebabymaker> @RubberFistFight i never understood that one cause like these games are so obviously about cycles
[2:01:02] <%KeiganOfAstora> Gotta find some upstairs
[2:01:05] <RubberFistFight> @Quack_of_Dawn There's tons more, this is just the part you can explore. There's visible sections you just can't get to.
[2:01:07] <danknugglit> He good boy
[2:01:09] <%patriotrenegade> You feel good beating up these mid-game enemies @peachsaliva
[2:01:13] <BigFingerRo> @DancesWitBalrog IT IS BROKE, AND GLASSES FIX IT
[2:01:20] <medril07> that walk was too short. boy needs exercise
[2:01:26] <%Dakuu75> I just remember the invis wall by the basalisk. is there another?
[2:01:35] <RubberFistFight> @freelancebabymaker Exactly. I have beef with DS2, but it's not the story that's the problem.
[2:01:37] <%FacetiousAF> paige how's it feel to be huge through some clean up?
[2:01:40] <benjiFG> there's an illusory wall in one of these corners
[2:01:47] <tanarath> His weight in poop?
[2:01:47] <%patriotrenegade> There’s a wall by that bonfire that leads to a shard.
[2:01:49] <%hewlettfan96> hello everyone apologies for my rudeness earlier
[2:01:51] <%Ziegsy> hes only got little legs
[2:01:51] <medril07> right. winter where I am

[2:02:12] <+megaman_sentinel> wall
[2:02:17] <%hewlettfan96> I had no idea that there was a literal 30 min ban from chat for using gay slurs
[2:02:19] <+realm_forge> Yeah bulldogs can overheat like crazy
[2:02:22] <HotSauceFiend> For a Young dog in general that seems like a lot of walks
[2:02:28] <%freelancebabymaker> dark souls 3 is my favorite one so i get SOOO salty when people pick it apart
[2:02:31] <RubberFistFight> @medril07 It's summer there and squashed-face dogs don't do well in the heat. At night it'd be cooler.
[2:02:31] <%KeiganOfAstora> She got the estus shard right?

[2:06:38] <Gregorhasjoined> ohhhhh shit dlc
[2:06:39] <+MisterAvry> you Darked ALL of the Souls!
[2:06:39] <%Monkeyweed21> @KeiganOfAstora she never fought Fume Knight so the greatsword wont mean much to her
[2:06:42] <%hewlettfan96> jesus how long did that take? didnt think Paige had it in her with her 'ahem' skills
[2:06:44] <DancesWitBalrog> This playthrough is basically the Dark Souls version of Plague's HUGE QUEST
[2:06:45] <blue8moon> maxed estus!
[2:06:51] <%KeiganOfAstora> @Monkeyweed21 No it's just a good big weapon

[2:08:19] <@SoFarFetched> pee break
[2:08:24] <medril07> she drinking poison?
[2:08:28] <DancesWitBalrog> FYASTEST THING ALIVE
[2:08:34] <BoxNavy> she loves to drink poison
[2:08:42] <+cdrom321> Pee and Pee Pee break.
[2:08:57] <+cdrom321> Is mustard poison now?
[2:08:59] <+the_mental_punk> @medril07 yes she is drinking coconut water
[2:09:09] <medril07> Pat might have that nurse love thing
[2:09:19] <DancesWitBalrog> mustard can be a poison if you tery enough
[2:09:31] <+the_mental_punk> Anything’s a poison when you’re Paige
[2:09:31] <DancesWitBalrog> tyry hard enuff*
[2:09:46] <DancesWitBalrog> dammit
[2:09:48] <Marakami_Sadaneo> I love this brb screen cirOwO
[2:09:50] <%rumtumtugnutz> @hewlettfan96 When you consider how much she actually played, it didn't take that long. And it got better when she got over the whole 'I need someone to hold my hand' thing
[2:09:54] <BoxNavy> mustard gas is a poison maybe i think
[2:09:54] <+cdrom321> @danceswitbalrog If you make it a gas.
[2:09:56] <%freelancebabymaker> @DancesWitBalrog you got this
[2:10:41] <satiresatyr> i just noticed the baba is you
[2:11:08] <DancesWitBalrog> oh, i miss most of the baba stream. did she get farther than her first time?
[2:11:17] <+the_mental_punk> Baba is me
[2:11:20] <+upandadam> she got negative further
[2:11:22] <+the_mental_punk> But you is baba
[2:11:27] <+JamesCorck> is Paige starting the DLCs tonight, or is she going to pause for today?
[2:11:30] <peachy996> It's funny Paige struggles the hardest at the beginning but once she clears that hump in the middle she easily takes on the hardest parts of end game
[2:11:40] <DancesWitBalrog> Paige never fails to amaze
[2:11:49] <%Kenzo2000> @MarkoTolstov This is the theme song from the nineties Sonic cartoon. Commonly called "Blue Streak"
[2:11:52] <Gregorhasjoined> imagine sekiro oohohohoh
[2:11:55] <danknugglit> Pizza <3
[2:12:05] <inkwell1932> hey everybody what's crackin
[2:12:07] <+MarkoTolstov> @Kenzo2000 thanks!
[2:12:16] <inkwell1932> i just got here
[2:12:36] <%doomunderthestairs> same
[2:12:41] <RubberFistFight> @Gregorhasjoined I believe both Pat and Paige said at one point that despite her wanting to do it, her reflexes are not good enough due to the lupus. Still, it would be interesting to see her try. She might dominate it, who knows?
[2:12:43] <+the_mental_punk> I want a wicdonalds sweet tea so bad
[2:12:45] <satiresatyr> wish i could play these games but they make me motion sick :( i cant be gamer
[2:13:01] <Ethel9727> I had never seen Paige's injured magical girl transformation before. It's amazing :o
[2:13:20] <+MarkoTolstov> @satiresatyr not with that attitude! You can if you believe!
[2:13:21] <%Kenzo2000> @MarkoTolstov You should give the real version a listen too. It's totally 90's radical
[2:13:24] <RubberFistFight> @satiresatyr for some people, the motion sickness is caused by the "motion blur" setting. Have you tried it with that off?
[2:13:28] <RubberFistFight> if so, disregard.
[2:13:43] <Gregorhasjoined> I'd be up for a watchmaking with pat @rubberfistfight
[2:13:46] <DancesWitBalrog> oh god, motion blur
[2:13:55] <RubberFistFight> wa wa

[2:14:43] <%freelancebabymaker> eat the glass
[2:14:43] <%KeiganOfAstora> Sure do that
[2:14:47] <%geekjacob> their should be something at the watchers bonfire

[2:15:27] <%Sotetsu> sipsipGasm
[2:15:27] <BoxNavy> yeah he came
[2:15:31] <%shurtal> go in the cave and talk
[2:15:32] <satiresatyr> no motion blur. its the constant moving back and forth, the angles of a game and how a character moves. skyrim made me motion sick too
[2:15:33] <+Ynkubus_> He spooged alright
[2:15:33] <godzookylives> Kreygasm Kreygasm Kreygasm Kreygasm
[2:15:37] <%patriotrenegade> its the dude in the cave behind you
[2:15:38] <peachy996> a cummy may have been performed
[2:15:38] <%FacetiousAF> nonono why a cummy
[2:15:41] <+the_mental_punk> This dlc is more creepy than anything
[2:15:44] <%ItalianWaifu> summer fucking sucks
[2:15:44] <%JoshManVGH> Yeah the whole land is his cummy hole
[2:15:45] <%FacetiousAF> friend
[2:15:45] <peachy996> Fuck Summer
[2:15:45] <blue8moon> say hello
[2:15:45] <%freelancebabymaker> summer sucks
[2:15:46] <%AncelDeLambert> Winter is cozy, but no season beats October
[2:15:47] <$Sphincter_Spelunker> Not when my power is out
[2:15:48] <%MarylandJutsu> GARBAGE MANNNN
[2:15:49] <%Gouf_Troop> fall is the best tho
[2:15:51] <sirrice77> that's the guy that did the cummy
[2:15:52] <benjiFG> i hate nevada cause it's constant summer
[2:15:52] <RubberFistFight> @PatStaresAt - so what's your theory, is Ariandel built on/"painted over" Ariamis? Or is it a whole separate new painting?
[2:15:53] <%doomunderthestairs> it's all about the fall and spring
[2:15:54] <%AncelDeLambert> October is the best month, don't even @ me
[2:15:55] <+Ynkubus_> Winters the ebst
[2:15:56] <blue8moon> heat kills me, so screw summer
[2:15:57] <BoxNavy> i cant decide if i hate summer or winter more
[2:15:57] <%Sotetsu> I like this guy's style
[2:15:59] <peachy996> Summer stops being fun when you're not a kid
[2:16:00] <%patriotrenegade> @PeachSaliva you talked to this guy before
[2:16:01] <%Monkeyweed21> my state doesn't burn in the winter
[2:16:02] <CandyCoatedConfection> love winter but objectively fall and spring are best
[2:16:03] <%FacetiousAF> he's just weird
[2:16:03] <+Taisuru> Quick!
[2:16:04] <+cdrom321> I miss Autumn and Spring, the reasonable seasons.
[2:16:16] <@PatStaresAt> Rubber, my headcannon is that painted worlds are completely different universes
[2:16:18] <Magicferret> Stop trespassing find your own house
[2:16:21] <Dr_Mooose> fall is where its at
[2:16:27] <%freelancebabymaker> the seasonable reasons
[2:16:28] <+vilecrois> Spring is awful for anyone with allergies
[2:16:29] <glass_marcus> Fall is the least offensive
[2:16:32] <drawerinkshow> Hit the lady
[2:16:32] <ToneBacas> but is it?
[2:16:33] <%doomunderthestairs> kill lady paige
[2:16:33] <%Sotetsu> She is so beautiful
[2:16:33] <$Sphincter_Spelunker> kill
[2:16:34] <@PatStaresAt> Specifically the painting from here is going to end up being BB
[2:16:34] <%Kenzo2000> kill tree
[2:16:34] <susukouhai> ye falling rocks!
[2:16:35] <%patriotrenegade> no its a tree
[2:16:38] <blue8moon> spooky tree
[2:16:39] <danknugglit> Kill lady
[2:16:43] <+ardentheaven> dead and on fire?
[2:16:46] <+MisterAvry> she's gonna get wrecked by trees
[2:16:47] <ToneBacas> LUL this damage
[2:16:49] <+tupacula1996> My skin hates the winter by my brain loves it.
[2:16:49] <+Taisuru> @PatStaresAt Get outta here pat we know all about your crazed theories of the entire world being anor londo
[2:16:51] <BigYanno> imma be honest I'm not sure a cold weapon will be the best thing here
[2:16:54] <medril07> darn vikings
[2:17:00] <RubberFistFight> @PatStaresAt Seems fair. Still, it's curious that this place has shared architecture, like Priscilla's arena.
[2:17:01] <Mr_pwng3> BB not elden ring?
[2:17:02] <%KeiganOfAstora> @PatStaresAt you really think the painting is Bloodborne?
[2:17:05] <%JenovasPuppet> @doomunderthestairs That particular lady can't be killed, only her sisters
[2:17:05] <+cdrom321> @freelancebabymaker Right. So, more points for Autumn.
[2:17:08] <peachy996> painting vecomes elden ring
[2:17:13] <%WhereIsWill> lets go millwood!
[2:17:15] <BigFingerRo> @BigYanno with those stats it could be an icicle and it wouldn't matter
[2:17:16] <+MisterAvry> winter would be a lot better if I could afford to ski
[2:17:18] <%AncelDeLambert> SHEET, FUCKING BULLDOG SHEET!
[2:17:18] <TurtlesAndTentacles> Paige if you were a tree animals would poops and pee on you. I imagine being a tree is hard
[2:17:21] <peachy996> you are stuck in the cycle forever and ever
[2:17:36] <%freelancebabymaker> @RubberFistFight i always thought of it having something to do with like painting restoration and studies or something
[2:17:40] <$SinisterBroccoli> I love the vibe of this area, it feels cold to look at
[2:17:42] <%AncelDeLambert> that torch is dope, btw
[2:17:49] <@PatStaresAt> Yknow Im glad we got peaches the extra estus
[2:17:51] <$SinisterBroccoli> and the fire feels hot
[2:17:51] <%Sotetsu> Dildo sucker

[2:19:17] <%JenovasPuppet> Paige has got to be Fromsoft's ideal player. She falls for EVERYTHING
[2:19:18] <%Sotetsu> Puppies!

[2:20:05] <drawerinkshow> Its more fair for them
[2:20:06] <CandyCoatedConfection> this makes me even more sad that Paige didn't do the DS2 snow dlc. it's so good.

[2:20:15] <+MisterAvry> she does it because she has big PP
[2:20:18] <%patriotrenegade> you fear bugs
[2:20:19] <medril07> does she need a shield if she's two handing?
[2:20:22] <%freelancebabymaker> see if one enemy makes her panic maybe thirty of them will make her feel better
[2:20:23] <$sylphyyyy> @Will_The_Soulless ME

[2:21:59] <Eightesu> I think your weapon might be bad for a snow area
[2:21:59] <%freelancebabymaker> oh no its gonna happen again

[2:39:59] <RubberFistFight> @freelancebabymaker it's a very sad game. a bit simplistic though. Less a game and more an interactive storybook with some combats and puzzles to break it up.

[2:56:07] <AthenaAegis> @RubberFistFight So.....Pat Kappa
[2:56:09] <%Dakuu75> So, is the DLC made for after the Main game? (Like, level wise)?
[2:56:23] <+Anderobot> Not really
[2:56:38] <RubberFistFight> @Dakuu75 mid-late game
[2:56:42] <sirrice77> @Dakuu75 Ashes is made for at least reaching late game, Ringed city is definitely for post game
[2:56:43] <EuropanLamprey> yes
[2:56:46] <hairtoday> yeah, drink in his face
[2:56:48] <%AncelDeLambert> god that is SO cool. Too bad I never run quality phys builds
[2:56:48] <%JenovasPuppet> @Dakuu75 This DLC seems to be for midish game, the other DLC is definitely made for post-game
[2:56:49] <RubberFistFight> i generally tackle Ariandel at about the 80% mark
[2:56:57] <RubberFistFight> and Ringed City right before the final boss
[2:57:03] <%Dakuu75> cool-cool~
[2:57:11] <+MarkoTolstov> the most acrobatic wolf ever
[2:57:14] <blue8moon> the game suggests having at least gotten to upper lothric castle, but you can enter it earlier if you want

[2:57:58] <medril07> go Paige
[2:58:04] <RubberFistFight> @freelancebabymaker because it's soulsborne. Wait til the midir fight in the next DLC. That music fucking hits./
[2:58:10] <Eightesu> oof

[2:58:12] <medril07> so close
[2:58:12] <tylerpyre> wat da dog doin?
[2:58:13] <+cdrom321> I just realized how Trevor Moore must've died. He auto-erotic asphyxiated himself with his thumb up his butt.
[2:58:13] <danknugglit> So close
[2:58:16] <MaximumOctober> close one
[2:58:18] <M0untain_wolf> Big boy with big movsss
[2:58:19] <%SophiaAmoreaVeritas> Good try
[2:58:20] <+Archphronimos> so close, well done
[2:58:20] <%patriotrenegade> @PeachSaliva this isnt a great boss fight
[2:58:21] <RubberFistFight> @PeachSaliva you got this. Two more swings and you're done.
[2:58:21] <M0untain_wolf> FASSST!
[2:58:27] <%FacetiousAF> SPEEEEEEEEED
[2:58:27] <Blackmage9999> too greedy
[2:58:28] <IrishWeegee> hes like sanic
[2:58:28] <%JenovasPuppet> Fox vs Wolf: Wolf wins
[2:58:28] <%SophiaAmoreaVeritas> Ember up?
[2:58:31] <%Grimlockfly> zoomies
[2:58:32] <medril07> he's the fastest thing around
[2:58:32] <Eightesu> he's just WOLFIN around Kappa
[2:58:36] <%AncelDeLambert> zoomies
[2:58:38] <%AncelDeLambert> yes
[2:58:39] <+OmegaGrimoire> lobosShrug
[2:58:40] <M0untain_wolf> naww bro
[2:58:42] <%patriotrenegade> Eli really hates this boss @PeachSaliva
[2:58:44] <+vilecrois> H-HAYAI
[2:58:44] <+onemoresunday> The only idea I can offer is don't try to combo, one hit, then roll?
[2:58:45] <benjiFG> yeah
[2:58:46] <%AncelDeLambert> it's the DLC, ember always, you're rich enough
[2:58:47] <%freelancebabymaker> i mean you have a shitload of them
[2:58:49] <%doomunderthestairs> I absolutely love the way he moves around
[2:58:49] <HaroldDonchee> don't you have like a shit load of embers
[2:58:52] <@PatStaresAt> @PeachSaliva bigger difference is if youre ALMOST dead drink twice fast
[2:58:52] <+Archphronimos> it's not like you're short on embers...
[2:58:53] <%Monkeyweed21> @cdrom321 its crazy how he had a gay porn magazine tucked in his arm
[2:58:53] <%JenovasPuppet> You have like 50 embers lol, you might as well.
[2:58:57] <%freelancebabymaker> eli hates this entire game
[2:59:03] <M0untain_wolf> You got this
[2:59:05] <RushUnplugged> Plague hates everything
[2:59:12] <$Sphincter_Spelunker> :O
[2:59:15] <HotSauceFiend> Where does the Big Dog pop out from? Is it hiding?
[2:59:18] <Eightesu> plague hates good things
[2:59:25] <+zamatermort> Eli only complains about things he likes, sooooooooo
[2:59:26] <+cdrom321> @Monkeyweed21 Now we'll just have to wait to find out if he'll accept his second chance.
[2:59:28] <silkoh> BORK
[2:59:29] <medril07> wonder who the champion was
[2:59:35] <%freelancebabymaker> eli doesnt even like bloodborne lol
[2:59:36] <Marakami_Sadaneo> now now chat, if you watched the Vods Plague do like some aspects of this game.
[2:59:39] <%Dirty_Dandere> Hate them
[2:59:41] <danknugglit> Pups snuffed
[2:59:50] <sirrice77> @zamatermort i would disagree considering how he is about Bloodborne
[2:59:51] <EuropanLamprey> idkibatd this boss too
[2:59:55] <medril07> did she signal the wolf?
[2:59:59] <@PatStaresAt> Its so weird paige doing this stuff upstairs cause I can watch it lol
[3:00:17] <+NobuuNobuu> wolf just drifting ion her corpse
[3:00:23] <M0untain_wolf> one more!
[3:00:24] <tylerpyre> When you knock his shield back like that why don't you get close and riposte him?
[3:00:31] <Profmcstevie> Have you asked the crabs for battle advice
[3:00:44] <%Ranryu692> @PatStaresAt F U T U R E
[3:00:45] <%freelancebabymaker> the tiniest damage increase would get the little wolves in one hit
[3:00:47] <silkoh> Paige, How much would you pay to have Zangief modded into boss form?
[3:00:47] <%Monkeyweed21> this boss isnt hard, you just gotta get the timing on his dash attack down
[3:01:00] <%Idziman> Idziman subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 56 months, currently on a 56 month streak! only 4 more months for that big milestone, it's been great following you for so long and the model makes me excited for everything to come
[3:01:14] <%JenovasPuppet> Good enough!
[3:01:17] <danknugglit> Greedy
[3:01:29] <%WhereIsWill> these rollcatches tho
[3:01:39] <%Dirty_Dandere> greed
[3:01:44] <$TheNewZealandStory> ! FROSTBITTEN !
[3:01:44] <HotSauceFiend> would standing in the gravesite make it harder for the big dog to move around in
[3:01:45] <%Monkeyweed21> Stamina Paige

[3:02:45] <BigFingerRo> But Paige, you've told us you LOVE exhausting your stamins
[3:02:46] <danknugglit> Those menaces
[3:02:56] <%JenovasPuppet> Stamina is the tool of cowards!
[3:02:56] <HaroldDonchee> oof
[3:02:58] <$Sphincter_Spelunker> uh huh atpCap
[3:03:00] <+WutangchickeN> is there a version of the model with the WcDonalds bag on the head? p00sFORTISSIMO p00sFORTISSIMO
[3:03:01] <@PatStaresAt> paige you immediately used all your stamina and couldnt move lol
[3:03:02] <%freelancebabymaker> thereUHHH
[3:03:06] <mr_saturday93> Paige you wasted your stamina again....
[3:03:08] <HotSauceFiend> NOT THE STATIONARY PILLAR
[3:03:18] <%ZephynM> I really like this vtuber thing we got going on.
[3:03:19] <@MelBrooksKA> @WutangchickeN Yes, I believe so
[3:03:19] <%Monkeyweed21> @PatStaresAt what if you got a poop transplant from an olympic athlete and got taller and fitter
[3:03:21] <%freelancebabymaker> how can this be
[3:03:22] <BigFingerRo> @PatStaresAt THAT'S WHAT SHE LIKES DON'T LOOK AT HEEEEEEER
[3:03:28] <%ZephynM> Also a big fan of animal ears. SilverSip
[3:03:32] <@PatStaresAt> babe can I get  apoop tranpsant for tall
[3:03:38] <mr_saturday93> She never learns
[3:03:39] <RubberFistFight> is there a ring she can drop for the chloranthy ring? Or is she dependent on the current set?
[3:03:43] <RubberFistFight> what about the estus ring?
[3:03:47] <HotSauceFiend> Btw as a dog owner, you burgle turds all the time when you pickup dog poop
[3:04:02] <%JenovasPuppet> Speedrun
[3:04:03] <peachy996> nuuuuu
[3:04:04] <RubberFistFight> s t u n l o c k e d
[3:04:04] <%Dirty_Dandere> Her regen is great she just needs to pause
[3:04:08] <BigFingerRo> YESSSSSSSSSS
[3:04:09] <%SophiaAmoreaVeritas> nuuuuuuuuuuuuuuu
[3:04:13] <danknugglit> Relax
[3:04:14] <+Birdigalore> You cant say that...
[3:04:18] <%freelancebabymaker> NIGHTMARE NIGHTMARE NIGHTMARE
[3:04:18] <+Unitedartists_56> This is worst
[3:04:19] <BigFingerRo> NO STRESS OUT MORE
[3:04:21] <%Monkeyweed21> @HotSauceFiend as the dog's primary caretaker the poops are your legal property
[3:04:24] <BigYanno> If she's struggling with the easiest DLC boss.....
[3:04:25] <%FacetiousAF> good stream tho
[3:04:29] <$Sphincter_Spelunker> you should try hitting the boss instead
[3:04:30] <%ZephynM> Take a breath and drink some whiskey? That might help.
[3:04:34] <%FacetiousAF> you did A LOT
[3:04:36] <RubberFistFight> man why do so many boss fights go that way in these games? You walk in, have one bad run, one great run where you NEARLY kill it, then a series of terrible runs before you down it.
[3:04:39] <%JenovasPuppet> I thought the wall was going to be getting down the tree, but you CRUSHED that!
[3:04:41] <%JoshManVGH> Don't hit walls, hit targets
[3:04:44] <RubberFistFight> I have the same experience.
[3:04:44] <AEnemyStandUser> vine1more vine1more vine1more
[3:04:50] <%AncelDeLambert> gotta smack the doggo in the mouth
[3:04:51] <%optimasmaximas> @BigYanno cant wait for friede
[3:04:55] <+Bigchill___> cuz your tired
[3:04:56] <%JoshManVGH> Except when you should hit walls.
[3:04:57] <+dellakitty> Do the Resident Evil Spin
[3:05:02] <%Dakuu75> that's how my cali-ass always talks
[3:05:02] <%Monkeyweed21> Paige is all surfed out
[3:05:05] <%Idziman> shred the gnar
[3:05:10] <@PatStaresAt> u got this babe you can kill dog
[3:05:11] <Profmcstevie> Gnarly wolves dude gonna wipeout
[3:05:11] <BigFingerRo> @BigYanno She's only struggling because she has to multitask and unga bunga hates that
[3:05:12] <danknugglit> 420 69 dude
[3:05:12] <%Grimlockfly> Quit Hatin, the sun is in Paige's eyes!
[3:05:13] <blue8moon> well, different bosses are difficult for different people LUL
[3:05:18] <mr_saturday93> Sound like a surfer, valley gal, and a bumpkin all at one
[3:05:19] <%JenovasPuppet> Flawless run! Nothing could go wrong now!
[3:05:21] <@PatStaresAt> NICE
[3:05:25] <%Dirty_Dandere> YEEAH
[3:05:26] <Rickbane> mace them good
[3:05:27] <%JenovasPuppet> Holy fuck but actually though
[3:05:29] <RushUnplugged> stuff in this area is also cold resistant so part of the mace damage is gone
[3:05:56] <RubberFistFight> @blue8moon true. on my last run it took literal hours to down the crystal sage. Was driving me nuts because it's such a pissant nothing of a boss.
[3:06:02] <%ZephynM> That is one BIG pupper and I love it.
[3:06:05] <Broand> Dog vs (burger) fox
[3:06:08] <peachy996> Settle for the one swing
[3:06:11] <%ZephynM> Can I take the puppy home, mom?
[3:06:14] <%Dakuu75> that's true. this place almost counters Paige's build
[3:06:23] <%Jack_of_No_Trades> Cold Puppy
[3:06:25] <+doc_ock_rokc> @PeachSaliva Lots of the dogo's resistances are to ICE so you may want to get another weapon for this area
[3:06:36] <RubberFistFight> the lag on that dash attack is such horsecrap
[3:06:46] <CandyCoatedConfection> is this like Sif's grandson or something?
[3:06:48] <+doc_ock_rokc> Wind WOLF
[3:06:56] <%Dirty_Dandere> Tacklu!
[3:06:59] <+Bigchill___> GET EM
[3:07:02] <%JoshManVGH> Woah!
