[1:18:23] <+lucaflowe> He's just gonna be bitter the entire time
[1:18:23] <%Keyd00d> Pat may be wrong but he's enhancing this playthrough
[1:18:24] <StarkMaximum> That is true

[1:34:44] <LysdexicAndVolingit> Who knew that Banjo was a puzzle game?!
[1:34:45] <%CommanderSqueaks> @Promessa_EX Yes she fucking does.
[1:34:46] <+HitchhikingThrough> Or I'm dumb???
[1:34:50] <%moink1234> Paige seperages gingo by race
[1:34:53] <CandideCamera> just as planned
[1:34:54] <+immortanjoestar> jinjos look so fucking ugly
[1:34:54] <Chuckgofer> zing
[1:34:55] <StarkMaximum> I will absolutely accept btw that Talon Trot being the best way to move and her making the sound every step is aggravating
[1:34:59] <+Cityscape17> what emulator are ya guys using btw?
[1:35:00] <+HitchhikingThrough> I saw some light blue shit IDK I don't know this game
[1:35:02] <pokefan9956> pat admitting he plays banjo in his spare time?
[1:35:03] <Neo_Kaiser> There's a skull at the stone hedge Paige
[1:35:03] <+skeletrail> Yeah it is
[1:35:05] <Louie_Salmon> Retroarch is so easy to use though
[1:35:05] <Srthunda> but this time you did it on stream
[1:35:05] <Blank9> only n64
[1:35:06] <Chuckgofer> Emulating N64 is rough
[1:35:06] <dlocke1991> Why does jinjo sound like a slur?
[1:35:06] <wiffernubbin> HARD J
[1:35:07] <Dhurkst> @floornine What? Your opinion needs to be extreme negative with no nuance! Heretic!
[1:35:07] <LVL1_Scumbag> It can be
[1:35:08] <Broand> nooo she missed an ekum bokum
[1:35:11] <Chuckgofer> Other consoles are way better
[1:35:11] <Explodincatz> PJ64 is garbage u dumbo
[1:35:12] <MyNameIsRasus> Depends on the game
[1:35:12] <MicrotonalMatt> Klungo does everything Grunty wants and he still gets beat up he’s totally Pat
[1:35:15] <niozonbi> Nah, they're gobbos
[1:35:16] <majindusto> EMULATION SUCKS lol
[1:35:16] <Daniel_Is_I> Only N64 and sometimes PS2
[1:35:16] <%Ranryu692> LUL
[1:35:17] <%Promessa_EX> don't worry about it
[1:35:18] <Phrickshun> Jingo absolutely sounds like it could be a slur

[1:35:19] <+cvp5127> use retroarch
[1:35:19] <%Solareon_> banjo is a colonizer
[1:35:19] <+ChestMimik> Consume their joy
[1:35:20] <+Whiskey_T_Foxtrot> using ancient stuff like pj64 certainly is
[1:35:21] <StarkMaximum> Yeah but they're assholes, Paige
[1:35:21] <%cache_22> Banjo is down for Imperialism
[1:35:21] <+firmlygraspi1> they were colonizers
[1:35:21] <AFlyingTaco1> SUCH IS THE WAY OF WAR
[1:35:21] <stardustcrusad3r> BASED'
[1:35:22] <%iosephe> Banjo Kazooie is pro-colonism

[1:35:28] <%YaBoiShamoi> Ur doing what white people all the time

[1:35:55] <+GalacticaPhanto> Pat sounds fucking miserable and I'm kinda here for it
[1:35:55] <%CommanderSqueaks> @commanderclaw That's the true reason why Pat hates it.
[1:36:00] <StarkMaximum> @niozonbi yeah that's what we said too right before founding america gottem

[1:36:09] <niozonbi> But clowns are fuuuun
[1:36:09] <%sonlascivious> I now understand why Pat despises this so much lmao he's right about the music. This is definitely something that requires nostalgia
[1:36:10] <+Whiskey_T_Foxtrot> pat hates xylophones
[1:36:10] <meli_mp4> I swear
[1:36:10] <%Nitsorinni> How many times will Pat be wrong this tream?
[1:36:12] <Louie_Salmon> It's a xylophone, what is clown
[1:36:13] <$Trenr> so... yeah, how do you not like the music lol
[1:36:14] <nmaten> this is clown shit?
[1:36:14] <Paperware> HIllbilly Clown Farts

[1:36:15] <trickquestionz> Pat HATES clowns
[1:36:15] <RetributionP> I'm contrarian I hate ekum bokum now
[1:36:15] <%maenos2> music is just too...peppy to me i guess.
[1:36:16] <+Scottigecko> Classic British gameplay
[1:36:16] <%iosephe> edgy clown shit
[1:36:17] <sporeian94> Said the guy who plays Resident Evil and probably unironically defends the basement theme
[1:36:17] <alvaroeltz> said the baby with the full diaper
[1:36:17] <+PipIV> Pat scared of clowns
[1:36:17] <TheIncoherentGamer> Pat the edgy Clown
[1:36:18] <%KeiganOfAstora> At least he sounds good
[1:36:18] <%Pookiedaexzile> CLOWN SHOES ASS MUSIC
[1:36:19] <$hrbeck_> OH NOOOOOO
[1:36:20] <%CommanderSqueaks> Pat there's literally not an edge on you.
[1:36:21] <BerryliciousDefinition> DRAG HIM

[1:36:22] <rytisone> Pat is based
[1:36:22] <theugliestguitar> it sounds like clown SEX. get it right, Pat
[1:36:23] <KeiPrime> it is a little calliope
[1:36:23] <tanarath> eekum bokum
[1:36:23] <$Wurmspawn> Well, it was developed by a british company sooooooo....
[1:36:24] <%Gouf_Troop> clown is fun
[1:36:25] <Louie_Salmon> Literally what is clown about a xylophone
[1:36:26] <Ell1ot> it reminds Pat of himself and that's why he hates it?
[1:36:26] <Daniel_Is_I> Pat you're literally an orb, a being without edges
[1:36:26] <Jjaz_R> Pat hates fun.
[1:36:27] <+thoughtlock> how does this sound like clown music
[1:36:27] <theshillman> Pat you are literally a sideshow
[1:36:28] <niozonbi> Kazzoie's gonna say the gamer word
[1:36:28] <Hzealot> how can pat be edgy if he so round
[1:36:29] <+frobotmk2> peach you are great
[1:36:31] <Broken_Sonex> He's really doubling down, huh.
[1:36:36] <mystrycarambola> banjo just a bear through he does not understand stealing
[1:36:37] <ShadeTheNovice> hut boy is definitely a slur
[1:36:38] <MicrotonalMatt> Pat is dexter from the episode he got bit by a clown
[1:36:38] <dots4eyes> Token no....Eekum Bokkum yes.
[1:36:39] <KingKrampus> Pat is the least edge thing period
[1:36:40] <TheCoolestRyker> @Fenrisulfr_V Ah, I was under the impression it would be on the Windows store but it probably isn't
[1:36:41] <%EyeFarted> FFIV loks like clown shit to me
[1:36:41] <MyNameIsRasus> EEKUM BOKUM
[1:36:43] <IminyourBase> pat heard this music 24/7 growing up til he hit 30 because he is a clown man
[1:36:43] <%moink1234> This is just a small collosal titan
[1:36:44] <%iosephe> of course
[1:36:45] <tanarath> This is fun music
[1:36:46] <$Dotta5> Mumbo need reparations
[1:36:46] <PixelJunker> I'm really struggling to understand the appeal of this game and I played it as a kid lol.
[1:36:47] <LysdexicAndVolingit> I want someone to make a rom hack of Banjo Kazooie with the 2snacks sound clip instead of the normal sound
[1:36:48] <%Ranryu692> I fucking LOVE Mumbo Jumbo
[1:36:49] <Jetssam> come and have a go, if you think you're hard enough
[1:36:49] <%Sotetsu> Sotetsu subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 3 months! Pat is usually right me mumbo
[1:36:51] <niozonbi> He's a bit fleshy for a skeleton
[1:36:52] <+MayorRev> BOKUM
[1:36:53] <+Whiskey_T_Foxtrot> Flutes, Xylophones and Steel Drums = Clown Music
[1:36:54] <commanderapathy> this makes me want to torture myself with donkey kong 64
[1:36:55] <wibbwobbler> watch it, I'm racist pal
[1:36:56] <Louie_Salmon> Percussion?
[1:36:57] <Srthunda> how dare
[1:36:57] <Broand> I knew we should have splurged on the marimba and not gotten that dinky xylophone!
[1:36:58] <%iosephe> marimbas are the real shit
[1:36:58] <+ChestMimik> So Pat plays the Xylophone
[1:36:58] <nmaten> what
[1:36:59] <+LouieRouie> That's a mask Paige
[1:37:01] <RetributionP> pats right
[1:37:01] <Louie_Salmon> Well yeah I guess
[1:37:02] <$DocMadfox> He's not a skeleton Paige, he's wearing a skull
[1:37:02] <CursedNobleman> thats kinda insulting
[1:37:02] <+PipIV> Marimba tho
[1:37:03] <pokefan9956> pat's been a lot tamer on dunking on banjo than I was expecting, tbh
[1:37:03] <+firmlygraspi1> Pat hates Ghibli
[1:37:04] <%CommanderSqueaks> Pat hates Whimsy
[1:37:04] <@commanderclaw> Nah, that's the cowbell
[1:37:06] <waterstealer> pat bang on bongo like caveman
[1:37:07] <+terraspan> Ground pound!
[1:37:08] <sporeian94> Pat you had to have two years of piano experience to play it in high school, no other instrument needed that
[1:37:08] <+MrAtheGreat> Hey it’s Eekum Bokum
[1:37:13] <%4213dead> It's like Pat's a parent who's watching his child play a game.
[1:37:16] <+thoughtlock> pat hates fun
[1:37:16] <Jetssam> breakup imminent
[1:37:17] <s1rcuit> @mystrycarambola tbf stealing is something I wish more people did NOT know about
[1:37:17] <GreyFoxHoundDD> Xylophone is the percussion of skeletons.
[1:37:17] <+MayorRev> It's a marumba
[1:37:19] <commanderapathy> I hate ghibli too
[1:37:19] <Dragon_Batman> I forget everytime
[1:37:19] <CursedNobleman> xylophone is harder than most other percussion instruments
[1:37:20] <+jjeefberky> pat only likes very serious M rated games
[1:37:21] <+BigDumBeak> I grew up with this game and liked it a ton but im kinda seeing what one would say about "clown shit" music when i hear burps and honks and doinks...
[1:37:22] <%jessyg920> Pat's missed opportunity for "I said what I said"
[1:37:22] <+skeletrail> You are in the HUGE minority here
[1:37:23] <+hornydino_> really?
[1:37:24] <WaitHowDidIGetHere> cheer200 I didn’t know there was a Korone Easter egg in “Banjo-Kazooie.”
[1:37:25] <MicrotonalMatt> Smash their huts
[1:37:25] <TheIncoherentGamer> Nothign wrong with a clown pat
[1:37:26] <%Keyd00d> what
[1:37:27] <niozonbi> He is a bear
[1:37:28] <Zerenis> All the people tilted cause Pat is grumpy cause he doesn’t like the game but has it forced down his throat is legit amusing
[1:37:28] <+MrAtheGreat> So is this emulated or remastered?
[1:37:28] <StarkMaximum> BANJO ISN'T SAFE...............
[1:37:30] <%Garthunox> its a mask paige
[1:37:32] <+AXL808> Paige's oversized, colorful pants are in the closet right now
[1:37:32] <%SharkMissile> I love this noice
[1:37:33] <+LouieRouie> Also Xylophones mean skeletons
[1:37:34] <majindusto> PAT IS SUCH A JERK TO GRANT KIRKHOPE lytPATHETIC
[1:37:36] <%CommanderSqueaks> Pat is too edgy to enjoy whimsy.
[1:37:36] <%Ranryu692> GI joe was for losers
[1:37:40] <PartyFavors> For work
[1:37:42] <waterstealer> yeah thats a sane thing to say pat
[1:37:43] <BlkFlameKami> 3 year old pat's lust for blood
[1:37:44] <Blank9> pat playing army men sarge's heroes
[1:37:44] <%AmanisHouseOfNonsense> You have to do it or Banjo will come to your house and break your legs
[1:37:44] <%Gouf_Troop> pat only plays cod like a big boi
[1:37:44] <MyNameIsRasus> Wow watch out guys Pat lives on the edge
[1:37:45] <$birdfella> It’s marimba though right?
[1:37:45] <$FoxInABeret> Fun fact if you watched GG back in the day: Grant Kirkhope said Mumbo's barks are mixed up clips of him saying "Come on and have a go if you think you're hard enough."
[1:37:46] <+frobotmk2> I like the contrast going on
[1:37:48] <LorcaNomad> pat wants to kill
[1:37:51] <Neo_Kaiser> You missed a skull!
[1:37:51] <%Promessa_EX> mom and dad took the gi joes away when i stripped them
[1:37:53] <+PipIV> Pat is a big man who plays the big zombo games
[1:37:55] <+uncledoodsauce> I wonder if simmons from yovideogames has said anything to pat yet
[1:37:57] <+crazyspartan214> Trumpet
[1:37:58] <%sleepy_coffee> oh geez i don't like how that bear force feeds that bird puzzle pieces
[1:37:58] <IminyourBase> which is the one that sounds like farts
[1:37:59] <%Garthunox> paige dated a clown
[1:38:00] <CursedNobleman> clarinet
[1:38:03] <sporeian94> Oboe
[1:38:04] <%DrkJP520> This is the most competent gameplay showcase by Paige.
[1:38:05] <+internetexplorer11> its a tuba
[1:38:05] <+terraspan> gorilla on Orange tree
[1:38:05] <TheIncoherentGamer> Clarinet
[1:38:06] <TubeMan642> basoon
[1:38:07] <mystrycarambola> @s1rcuit yea i agree
[1:38:07] <nmaten> rn its oboe
[1:38:07] <goblinpuppy> clarinet
[1:38:08] <LordSmokedMeats> It is a piccolo
[1:38:15] <niozonbi> It's a big trumpet
[1:38:16] <%CommanderSqueaks> Piccolo sounds closer.
[1:38:19] <%Gouf_Troop> pat only like big brass
[1:38:19] <jbp238> the woodwind known as a Casio
[1:38:20] <%desfore> This is not a clarinet
[1:38:21] <HoldBtoRun> Pat just sounds salty af
[1:38:22] <+frobotmk2> I played clarinet in middle school and I thought I was king shit
[1:38:24] <KeiPrime> its a n64
[1:38:26] <Srthunda> even if it isnt, clarinets deserve it
[1:38:26] <+skeletrail> Pat making a HARD stance against ALL instruments
[1:38:27] <StarkMaximum> Tubas CAN suck your ass Pat, they're big enough for it
[1:38:27] <pokefan9956> tubas fucking rule
[1:38:27] <%moink1234> Muh squidward
[1:38:27] <nyacoo> Why pat hate music
[1:38:28] <alextrebeken> lol that aint no calarenete
[1:38:29] <Louie_Salmon> So just literally all wind and brass instruments?
[1:38:29] <RetributionP> tuba knight
[1:38:30] <sporeian94> Mumbo's Mountain gets a version reminiscent of traditional African tribal music, with reed flutes, drums, and chanting that perfectly suits the shaman who has turned against his former student and has decided to help our heroes defeat her.
[1:38:31] <majindusto> Pat is Allergic to Whimsy
[1:38:32] <%Alazull> Pat is the personification of a tuba
[1:38:32] <BerryliciousDefinition> I played clarinet in junoir high and I hated it
[1:38:33] <ancrest_tant> It’s a shitty midi clarinet
[1:38:34] <CursedNobleman> fuck you pat. and its some kinda reed woodwind i think, thats all i can tell
[1:38:35] <LysdexicAndVolingit> Idk if a tuba could handle all that cake Pat
[1:38:36] <%CommanderSqueaks> Pat has broken ears and a broken nose.
[1:38:36] <%Promessa_EX> oranges are nice
[1:38:36] <MicrotonalMatt> It’s a calliope
[1:38:36] <Jetssam> it can go to hell after I know what it's called
[1:38:40] <+ChestMimik> RUDE
[1:38:43] <niozonbi> What a jerk
[1:38:43] <+AbnormalVoid> Pat just hates tubas cause one plays whenever he walks around town Kappa
[1:38:43] <+toastybites> just got here is Paige trolling Pat
[1:38:43] <commanderapathy> sax is the superior choice
[1:38:44] <$Wurmspawn> Pat Tuba's are the fart brass instrument.
[1:38:45] <+PipIV> sousaphone tho?
[1:38:45] <@SoFarFetched> Diddy Kong why you naked D:
[1:38:47] <alvaroeltz> yo, dont you shit talk tubas when a character like big band exists
[1:38:48] <%rumtumtugnutz> that's definitely an oboe or a clarinet, not flutey enough for a piccolo
[1:38:48] <+allups> cuz ur an ass lol
[1:38:49] <%UvBenServed> Orange: "Oranges are nice"
[1:38:50] <s1rcuit> Banjo's super fit
[1:38:50] <%MisterRockett> That's totally what becomes the Diddy model.
[1:38:50] <$Dotta5> It's a Jiggy
[1:38:51] <goblinpuppy> watch this monkey wat a sentient orange alive
[1:38:52] <SilverRoddo> Plague plays tuba.
[1:38:53] <IminyourBase> how did he help you? HE MOVED
[1:38:53] <ShadeTheNovice> you gave the sentient orange to a monkey to eat
[1:38:53] <sporeian94> GUH HUH!
[1:38:54] <%moink1234> THAT IS LITERALLY DIDDY KONG
[1:38:55] <+TurnipKupo> yeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeees
[1:38:55] <MyNameIsRasus> Banjo's not even fat
[1:38:57] <Louie_Salmon> Wait didn't you just compliment Demon's Souls for using tubas?
[1:38:58] <dots4eyes> Piccolo and oboe sound more shrill
[1:38:58] <savagesforblood> happy new years pat and paige. I hope you guys have an amazing 2021
[1:39:00] <xanerts> pat you like Des ost
[1:39:00] <%CommanderSqueaks> Pat hates Big Band confirmed
[1:39:02] <%CptCreampuff16> i forgot about the burp
[1:39:02] <$Dotta5> Jigsaw is copyright
[1:39:04] <%ThomasOfTroy> let me throw endless oranges at you to get one orange back
[1:39:06] <sporeian94> And somehow PSP emulation is like black magic
[1:39:07] <StarkMaximum> AND IT'S SPECIFICALLY N64, Gamecube and Wii emulate fine!
[1:39:08] <+Rofiarf> i mean, n64 isn't that great
[1:39:09] <CursedNobleman> N64 emulation is fair, coule be better
[1:39:11] <Blank9> ps3 emulation is legitimately better than n64 emulation now
[1:39:11] <%cache_22> *The N64 is still terrible after all theses years.
[1:39:14] <niozonbi> Eggs eggs we're the eggs
[1:39:15] <Jetssam> dat's because the system is trash
[1:39:15] <%Gouf_Troop> aint as bad as ps1 emu
[1:39:15] <%AmanisHouseOfNonsense> Yeah, Im kinda baffled as to how no one's made something better
[1:39:17] <+AbnormalVoid> it's fine, you just have to be good at emulation, which sounds dumb, but its the truth lol
[1:39:21] <IminyourBase> everything has sentience and the implication of that is terrifying
[1:39:21] <Chuckgofer> It's better than like saturn emulation but not by enough
[1:39:22] <TheBensonator_> THEY STILL CANT EMULATE ROGUE SQUADRON
[1:39:22] <a_mad_dragon> because the n64 is a janky-ass system
[1:39:22] <+ChestMimik> Fear Tuba
[1:39:24] <%CommanderSqueaks> E G G
[1:39:24] <+GalacticaPhanto> Oh god are they all sentient?
[1:39:26] <TheHeroAppears> is this not fear pat
[1:39:26] <Ner234> FEAR TUBA
[1:39:26] <TheBensonator_> AND IT MAKES ME psaBig MAD
[1:39:27] <%rumtumtugnutz> Gamecube emulation is easier than N64
[1:39:27] <TheIncoherentGamer> Tuba = fear
[1:39:27] <Paperware> It must get really annoying living in world where everything has eyes and talks
[1:39:28] <+Asi9> Rip MF DOOM BibleThump
[1:39:28] <Dhurkst> FEAR THE TUBA
[1:39:29] <+skeletrail> FEAR TUBA
[1:39:29] <%ItalianWaifu> GIRL ATTACK
[1:39:30] <nmaten> E D G Y
[1:39:31] <+QuadraticGravity> Pat are you guys using P64 or something more modern?
[1:39:32] <MicrotonalMatt> Hunt the monke
[1:39:33] <niozonbi> NL?
[1:39:36] <%Promessa_EX> this also uses tuba for fear. pat fears it
[1:39:36] <pokefan9956> so pat is a hypocrite? :^)
[1:39:39] <TheIncoherentGamer> Tuba also = Clumsy
[1:39:40] <IminyourBase> the eggs are alive and have thoughts and feelings
[1:39:41] <TubeMan642> To bad you guys couldn't use the 360 port of Banjo
[1:39:41] <fran031> n64 has like, four good games
[1:39:41] <laziest_lid> Fire your children as ammo
[1:39:42] <%iosephe> vomit egg
[1:39:43] <syanvpg> is not Xylophone used for that sick SMT IV boss fight?
[1:39:43] <+hornydino_> bird is an asshole
[1:39:51] <AFlyingTaco1> It's not different than Yoshi shitting out an egg though
[1:39:52] <+QuadraticGravity> Cause Project 64 is super old
[1:39:55] <%UvBenServed> Kreygasm
[1:39:55] <%Keyd00d> Poor kazooie
[1:39:56] <%ThomasOfTroy> Can plague confirm if that's how chickens work?
[1:39:56] <%CommanderSqueaks> CLOACA
[1:39:57] <niozonbi> Oof
[1:39:59] <%marvel877> We can emulate Sega Saturn, Dreamcast, fucking Gamecube, but the N64 STILL eludes decent emulation... damn it.
[1:39:59] <seanaramicus> Pat it's clear you can't tell the difference between a marimba and a xylophone
[1:40:00] <Louie_Salmon> Mouth normal, back gross, got it
[1:40:00] <honeyman18> Squeeze the bitch
[1:40:02] <+ChestMimik> Why is everyone in this game so mean to each other?
[1:40:05] <Laecerelius> Pat just wants his clown fart basement music
[1:40:07] <PaPaSeppuku> apparently the sexbox does emulation pretty good
[1:40:07] <goblinpuppy> Backpack is slang for ass
[1:40:08] <$RetroCop87> Imagine if women gave birth through their mouth

[1:45:20] <+PipIV> Metal Gear
[1:45:21] <+razielhex> 1998 CAN'T BE BEAT
[1:45:23] <%arcaderabbit48> The best thing Banjo-Kazooie ever did was lead to the existence of Banjo-Tooie
[1:45:25] <derap41> 1998 was a great year for gaming
[1:45:27] <%Gouf_Troop> metal gear zzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzz
[1:45:27] <%Keyd00d> A good time for games

[1:45:58] <TheIncoherentGamer> Metal Gear Plays like shit compared to this

[1:46:38] <%cobalt_phoenix_> Pat is saying he played better games
[1:46:38] <Jetssam> that's true, you can't age badly when you already start at garbage. ;)
[1:46:38] <+firmlygraspi1> you were like 4'2"

[1:46:49] <%bob900000> does that matter?
[1:46:49] <tsubakiparadox> Pat wants to be done with the baby game for babies LUL
[1:46:50] <Doofmaster> that's a teenager attitude
[1:46:50] <$Sphincter_Spelunker> banjo is the oatmeal raisin cookie of video games. fuck you, pat
[1:46:50] <CriticKitten> Pat, you're still a baby today
[1:46:50] <%MisterRockett> You were an edgy 13 year old who wanted to act like you were a big kid.
[1:46:51] <pokefan9956> binky dick pat
[1:46:51] <dots4eyes> I mean...she's not wrong
[1:46:51] <%CommanderSqueaks> Pat you are PROUD of throwing temper tantrums, this game was literally made for you.

[1:46:54] <+preppyposs> Oh so pat played it as an edgy teenager
[1:46:55] <$Grimlockfly> Final fantasy 7 was out
[1:46:55] <ChrisPlaysThing> @CursedNobleman it was out by the time this came out Release JP: March 9, 1996 NA: May 13, 1996
[1:46:55] <derap41> It was for nintendo so yea
[1:46:58] <+logoth_> "I dont remember how to shit eggs again"
[1:46:59] <+Milosolaire> except for the subliminal egg fetish stuff
[1:46:59] <%maenos2> "shit eggs" promptly throws up egg instead
[1:47:00] <%bob900000> 13 is a baby
[1:47:01] <TheCoolestRyker> Pat's just jealous that we get to play the Chad Banjo-Kazooie and he's stuck with the Virgin Metal Gear Solid
[1:47:04] <AdmiralButtloaf> this song sounds like farts
[1:47:04] <MicrotonalMatt> Shoot da monke
[1:47:04] <Fear_Ranjer> "waa this game doesn't have guns and an adult story"

[1:47:05] <+NigglyDiggly> you yourself said you do not like music
[1:47:06] <CursedNobleman> @ChrisPlaysThing ah, fair enough
[1:47:06] <%Gouf_Troop> edgy teen edgy teen
[1:47:07] <Blank9> if you want a dumpy n64 platformer that's not as good as mario, you could just play glover or chamelon twist
[1:47:08] <MyNameIsRasus> Sounds like something a teenager would say
[1:47:09] <niozonbi> real monkey scream
[1:47:10] <ShadeTheNovice> you play video games for a living, your a baby

[1:47:18] <$DocMadfox> Pat, are you really going to argue tht you have taste in music?
[1:47:18] <stardustcrusad3r> wait what does pat listen to
[1:47:19] <%Ranryu692> "Why do people tap their foot while listening to music?" - Pat while playing Cadence of Hyrule
[1:47:20] <Kghaleon> Why not play the xbox port that's part of Rare replay lol
[1:47:20] <pokefan9956> pat boutta talk about his taste in music and get dunked on
[1:47:21] <+OrangeMDT> @dhurkst if whimsy is gorilla noises and whatever comes out of kazooies mouth when she runs, then yes, I hate it with a passion
[1:47:21] <arancet> @PeachSaliva pat dont forget the time, 13 min to go
[1:47:21] <TheCoolestRyker> OH WAIT NO I CAN'T SAY THAT WORD I FORGOT
[1:47:22] <+ArtoriasTheTrenchfighter> Pat is a grownup baby, this game is for children
[1:47:23] <RetributionP> pat was right I'm tired of the game making fart noises at me
[1:47:25] <Louie_Salmon> YEAH IT IS
[1:47:25] <nmaten> pat's music taste is def sus, sometimes on point, sometimes very wack
[1:47:26] <+NigglyDiggly> correct
[1:47:26] <%marvel877> Pat's a kid who wished to be older under the assumption he would also get taller in the deal.
[1:47:27] <mystrycarambola> big monke
[1:47:27] <%DrkJP520> It's an ape, monkeys have tails

[1:53:42] <NeroInfinite> LUL
[1:53:42] <%VexicBayn> YEEEAAHHH TEDDY BEAR PICNIC
[1:53:43] <Quiet__Viking> why didn't you just play this on a xbox
[1:53:44] <Doofmaster> N64 emulation is frustrating because they got so close and then gave up for like 20 years
[1:53:47] <Quikanims> the dog is snoring
[1:53:47] <Davo46> Paige there is a weird whining noise coming from off cam, can you fix that please
[1:53:48] <Louie_Salmon> Retroarch has always been easy for me
[1:53:48] <nyacoo> Why not just use retroarc?
[1:53:49] <ChungusQuest> yeah there's some advanced jank going on here
[1:53:49] <Explodincatz> should have used BizHawk
[1:53:51] <SociallyAwkwardToaster> Shoulda used the 360/xbone version Kappa
[1:53:53] <tsubakiparadox> a Goof troop
[1:53:54] <%CommanderSqueaks> As someone who uses emulators a lot, N64 emulation is EASILY the worst next to maybe Dreamcast emulation
[1:54:00] <%BinaryFireball> will say that the upscaling does look nice though
[1:54:00] <nmaten> its better than emulating og xbox
[1:54:01] <%moink1234> When is the Mr Krabs OD on ketamine speedrun?
[1:54:02] <%FacetiousAF> 10-9-8-7-6-5-vore-3-2-1
[1:54:06] <tanarath> the best
[1:54:09] <%maenos2> i said it earlier i'll say it again the absolute CONSTANT noise kazooie makes while running is fucking maddening
[1:54:10] <ammobasket> dude he doesn't have an Xbob
[1:54:15] <Jetsfantasy> Shoulda waited for the Wii U version Kappa
[1:54:16] <+MayorRev> Just say you hate the N64, we know you're thinking it
[1:54:17] <%DrkJP520> why not buy xbox, mr youtubetwitch millionaire?
[1:54:19] <Kghaleon> What's the best stage and why is it Mad monster mansion?
[1:54:19] <+QuadraticGravity> @maenos2 it's okay to be wrong
[1:54:25] <SMuffinMan> The slo-mo Jinjo sound in the final boss fight fucking slays me lmao
[1:54:30] <+NigglyDiggly> maddiningly fun maybe
[1:54:32] <Jetssam> isn't the replay release, like... time limited and now unsupported?
[1:54:37] <%maenos2> @QuadraticGravity You all have lost your minds, tha'ts fine. I'm still sane, not you. You're the one who should be in this boat, not me!
[1:54:38] <VritraReiRei> @PeachSaliva 5 MINUTES

[1:54:55] <SmiIezForMilez> Pat, bizhawk is amazing for N64 emulation when you figure it out
[1:54:58] <+adimcorner> WOOO!!!!
[1:55:00] <+QuadraticGravity> JAM TIME
[1:55:01] <Dhurkst> @maenos2 It's really not; it's one of the mildest character noises in the game.

[1:56:07] <a_karmachameleon> so I found a recipe for ice cream 1 part whipping cream to 1 part condensed milk and vanilla extract, whip the whipping cream first to light peaks once you get that part done add in chilled condensed milk with a mixer and add the vanilla then put in bowl and freeze for 1 day and there you go ice cream base to add in stuff later.

[2:08:06] <KaitlynnHere> There’s no way!
[2:08:06] <$Sphincter_Spelunker> Ratchet and Clank was about capitalism and it went over people's heads

[2:08:24] <+NigglyDiggly> he was a gamegear kid lmao
[2:08:24] <Kghaleon> Show Pat the key in the sandcastle so he hates the game even more.
[2:08:25] <AFlyingTaco1> @sighphers Pretty much
[2:08:26] <Neo_Kaiser> Ratchet and Clank was about consumirism.

[2:08:52] <%CommanderSqueaks> Pat, you don't need to collect all of the moons.
[2:08:52] <+skeletrail> There are 10 per level pat
[2:08:53] <$KnivesEve> fair
[2:08:54] <DetroitSentai> Notes are keys, jiggies are stars
[2:08:55] <CursedNobleman> thats fair
[2:08:55] <+darklordfodder> It's different
[2:08:55] <RyanGelatin> wow 7 2snacks references in one stream
[2:08:58] <sporeian94> EEKUM BOKUM!
[2:08:58] <+AbnormalVoid> there's less Jiggies than Stars in Mario 64
[2:08:59] <%maenos2> i will grant the song here isn't as grating to me
[2:09:00] <Louie_Salmon> No these are good, like the tutorial was too easy, but the entire rest of game they're good

[2:09:03] <Davo46> 10 Puzzle pieces pat. 10.
[2:09:04] <IncredibleMeh> help dude with his depression, you get a moon
[2:09:05] <FaceOBear> Odyssey is still better than this game

[2:09:09] <%UvBenServed> AHOY
[2:09:11] <Zerenis> At least Mario is charming
[2:09:11] <$TheNewZealandStory> mario odyssey is like if someone thought the korok seeds were the point of botw, odyssey is shit
[2:09:15] <goblinpuppy> I actually like that about Odyssey, kids can complete the game or older players can choose their difficulty
[2:09:15] <%cgreene64> I do not like burp man
[2:09:15] <waterstealer> literal burps
[2:09:16] <+darklordfodder> You're judging it off of the first level...notice she hasn't got any on this level yet.
[2:09:18] <%CommanderSqueaks> Kazooie is such a bitch, I love her.
[2:09:18] <Louie_Salmon> And levels never have more than 10, so it doesn't bloat like Odyssey
[2:09:20] <gryffinp> A hat in time is the best hat-based platformer of 2017, change my mind
[2:09:21] <dots4eyes> How does one learn how to speak in burps?
[2:09:22] <+TopTieramisu> Eekum bokum
[2:09:23] <KaitlynnHere> He cry cause he’s in this game
[2:09:23] <RajelSkoven> he even sounds like pat too
[2:09:24] <johnconnorpliskin> I didn’t like mario odyssey for that reason but banjo isn’t that bad

[2:10:01] <%CommanderSqueaks> Hippos cannot swim Pat.
[2:10:02] <$TheNewZealandStory> @goblinpuppy older players can't really choose their difficulty when virtually the entire game is a cakewalk
[2:10:02] <floornine> PAT YOU NEED FLOATIES JUST TO GO IN THE DEEP END
[2:10:02] <DetroitSentai> bottle eyes
[2:10:04] <Dhurkst> @TheNewZealandStory It's really not at all, dude. Way too harsh.

[2:14:29] <%FacetiousAF> this might be a better mario 64 tho
[2:14:29] <+Dunmarkh> Subnautica gets less scary after you get the mech suit and kill everything
[2:14:30] <Dhurkst> Kid brain + primal fear of the deep = BIG SCARY
[2:14:31] <insaneintentionsyo> I'm going back to bawk bawkBruh
[2:14:32] <deerlearning> DOMESTIC VIOLENCE = FUNNY TO PAIGE
[2:14:38] <Chuckgofer> Yes
[2:14:41] <Louie_Salmon> It gets very hard
[2:14:41] <tanarath> This game is kinda better than mario
[2:14:42] <+McSoliace> yes
[2:14:42] <+skeletrail> Pat its Level 2
[2:14:42] <+AbnormalVoid> it gets MUCH MUCH HARDER
[2:14:42] <+NigglyDiggly> your mother is easy patrick
[2:14:42] <%Keyd00d> yes
[2:14:42] <%marvel877> Pat, you're a tank controls apologist, you don't get to bitch about N64 controls.
[2:14:44] <%Promessa_EX> it does get harder
[2:14:45] <niozonbi> The final level is a lot harder
[2:14:47] <Chuckgofer> little from bioth
[2:14:47] <Doofmaster> Rusty Bucket Bay is actually hard
[2:14:48] <%doowopshabop> Fireworks going off for like 15 minutes now
[2:14:48] <%Roasted_Pheasant> Gets way harder
[2:14:49] <+terraspan> It gets harder
[2:14:50] <Fear_Ranjer> It gets WAAAAY harder but it's a natural curve
[2:14:50] <CursedNobleman> its gets significantly more challenging
[2:14:51] <$Trenr> no it gets significantly harder
[2:14:53] <+ChestMimik> It me
[2:14:54] <+darklordfodder> Odyssey, overrated. SM64 great but overrated. Sunshine, properly rated. Galaxy, incredible and rated correct.
[2:14:54] <rosencruez> yes it ramps up
[2:14:54] <SomeSageAdvice> ramps up
[2:14:55] <critiquequartz> It ramps ip
[2:14:55] <%bob900000> easy
[2:14:55] <Louie_Salmon> Like not crazy hard, but significantly harder
[2:14:55] <Explodincatz> last level is hard
[2:14:56] <+Chester_goes_Berserk> rusty bucket bay is a fucker
[2:14:57] <+AwkwardSnails> gets pretty hard later
[2:14:58] <SyntaxSpeedway> That hard part is how much you need to collect to even get the normal ending
[2:14:58] <DetroitSentai> It spikes iirc
[2:15:00] <Zerenis> Aside from the final boss this is a baby game
[2:15:00] <%marvel877> RAMPS UP
[2:15:00] <+Seitine> I guess it gets harder in some places.
[2:15:00] <Kghaleon> Definitely harder, I had to use a guide to find some of the later game jiggies.
[2:15:00] <+rawblink> it gets harder near the end
[2:15:00] <IncredibleMeh> the desert and mansion are pretty tough
[2:15:00] <%baronblank> I remember it getting harder later but a lot of it's not too bad iirc
[2:15:00] <+HitchhikingThrough> bruh
[2:15:01] <@commanderclaw> It gets harder, but it'
[2:15:02] <%TheLemuroid> it def gets harder but easy to beat as an adult
[2:15:02] <+FuriousCabinBoy> its get harder but the 2nd game is way harder
[2:15:03] <+HitchhikingThrough> just fucking jump
[2:15:04] <%hairtoday> i picks up a bit
[2:15:04] <+AbnormalVoid> very good difficulty curve
[2:15:06] <%Keyd00d> It ramps up yes
[2:15:08] <Profmcstevie> Fairly smooth, a few moments in some levels and a kinda tough final boss
[2:15:08] <+Houndemise> The last level is bullshit
[2:15:08] <+overdoodles> starts easy, gets harder
[2:15:08] <$Trenr> the final boss in particular, of both banjo games, are stupid hard
[2:15:09] <Doofmaster> final boss is pretty nuts
[2:15:10] <MicrotonalMatt> There’s some hard af ones later
[2:15:10] <+skeletrail> Oh, yeah it does.
[2:15:15] <AFlyingTaco1> Fuck this song is so good
[2:15:16] <ammobasket> it gets frustrating, and ther's a quiz
[2:15:16] <+darklordfodder> New Super Mario series, all basically the same game.
[2:15:17] <jellssssss20> The controls are the hardest part, just like EVERY n64 game
[2:15:17] <indicakujo> I genuinely think it ramps up
[2:15:20] <$Sphincter_Spelunker> @PeachSaliva show Pat the game over cutscene
[2:15:21] <trickquestionz> Paige makes it look much harder than it might seem.
[2:15:21] <KaitlynnHere> Paige is sundowning real hard tonight
[2:15:22] <+Seitine> Kid brain though- everything seems easier than it was when you go back to it.
[2:15:22] <%Nitsorinni> Hat in Tiume was piss easy
[2:15:24] <niozonbi> This doesn't either
[2:15:24] <$TIME_PUNCHER> does Pat love Banjo Kazooie now
[2:15:25] <+AwkwardSnails> this is like whomps fortress
[2:15:26] <RyuuAoi> I remember always quitting when I was younger and playing SMASH.
[2:15:26] <insaneintentionsyo> I hated seal the deal
[2:15:26] <+skeletrail> Like its not ball busting but its got a curve
[2:15:28] <Profmcstevie> The testing crushing was DLC
[2:15:29] <gryffinp> A hat in time only gets testicle-crushing in Death Wish.
[2:15:29] <%FacetiousAF> PAT hat in time is a refined masterpiece
[2:15:30] <niozonbi> But it pick up
[2:15:31] <Chuckgofer> its not dark souls but it ramps up
[2:15:31] <AmericanaRed> SEARCH OF REPTAR THO NotLikeThis
[2:15:31] <+NigglyDiggly> none of it is terribly difficult
[2:15:32] <+AbnormalVoid> Hat in Time's challenge mode is fucked up
[2:15:32] <%Keyd00d> Games tend to start out easy
[2:15:35] <Kghaleon> HiT has harder bosses
[2:15:35] <Broand> Someone didn't seal the deal!
[2:15:37] <Louie_Salmon> Okay, nice
[2:15:38] <RetributionP> the last boss is the dmc4 mini game but worse
[2:15:39] <indicakujo> but fairly other than the quiz which is like rng
[2:15:42] <+McSoliace> hat in time has too many good mechanics to be hard
[2:15:44] <tanarath> it definitely ramps
[2:15:45] <+MarshallLee67> a hat in time in death wish CBT'd me
[2:15:46] <%TheLemuroid> I played it a few years back to relive and beat it easily as an adult
[2:15:47] <+Sendrak70> Happy New Year! Only about 16 minutes late.
[2:15:48] <+darklordfodder> Starts getting hard at the third world.
[2:15:48] <+NigglyDiggly> it's a fairly smooth ride but some shit requires perfection
[2:15:51] <%CommanderSqueaks> The game over scene in this game made me feel weird as a child.
[2:15:52] <glass_marcus> Yea challenge pack will rip your balls off
[2:15:56] <%Promessa_EX> egg it
[2:15:57] <+AbnormalVoid> drain the swamp @PeachSaliva
[2:15:59] <Djinnazz> DMC4 mini game is easy as shit.
[2:16:01] <Kghaleon> Look for the bucket
[2:16:02] <%marvel877> Hat in Time copied Mario Sunshine more than Banjo.
[2:16:02] <WolfemanMaverik> just swim in there
[2:16:04] <+Fooguwu> no one did
[2:16:05] <%Keyd00d> me

[2:37:55] <Chuckgofer> Better than dmc1s underwater controls
[2:37:56] <nmaten> its like dmc 1 baD
[2:37:56] <+darklordfodder> A will swim slower.

[2:37:59] <+terraspan> other button
[2:38:01] <%CommanderSqueaks> It's Mario 64, basically.

[2:38:10] <+firmlygraspi1> its still good, she's just mashing swim
[2:38:12] <Kghaleon> You point your character and swim forward, that's it
[2:38:13] <Darren716> I mean Mario 64 had fine swimming
[2:38:14] <+skeletrail> You turn better when you stop, but yeah bad
[2:38:16] <chambatron> The control aren't really that bad. It's just really difficult for Paige
[2:38:16] <Rostichenburg> Same as Mario 64
[2:38:17] <MichelangeloStark> press A for more precise swimming
[2:38:17] <%Ranryu692> does anything have good swimming controls now?

[2:40:55] <+darklordfodder> A SWIMS SLOWER
[2:40:55] <Chuckgofer> "Here asshole" loving elationship
[2:40:56] <%CommanderSqueaks> No 64 game had good swim controls.
[2:40:58] <niozonbi> The A button makes it smoother
[2:40:59] <Mirrorcatch> 2 swim buttons though
[2:41:01] <+jjeefberky> the swimming is actually WAY better than most
[2:41:02] <MichelangeloStark> pooping eggs onto the shark kills it
[2:41:05] <%Keyd00d> OTHER swim button
[2:41:06] <+AbnormalVoid> camera's better on the XBOX port
[2:41:07] <insaneintentionsyo> give pat the controller

[2:41:18] <nmaten> GHOST SHARK
[2:41:20] <Zerenis> A game inherently cannot be fun if you can’t control it. That argument makes no sense
[2:41:21] <ChungusQuest> yo Goldeneye controls SUCK ASS now
[2:41:22] <niozonbi> Sequel bait
[2:41:27] <Doofmaster> that island is for cut postgame stuff
[2:41:29] <CandideCamera> the sign literally says sharkfood
[2:41:30] <RushUnplugged> "ok this part sucks, and this other part sucks, and this other thing isn't good, but other than all those things that are terrible, it's a good game"
[2:41:30] <insaneintentionsyo> insane120Lewdsamine
[2:41:32] <%CommanderSqueaks> Goldeneye has aged like milk compared to this, and this game hasn't aged exactly like wine.
[2:41:32] <goblinpuppy> the secret ice key thing is in this level right

[2:44:57] <dots4eyes> I love listening to mirrors :)
[2:44:58] <CandideCamera> y'all deserve each other
[2:44:58] <AFlyingTaco1> SO YOU WERE SAYING
[2:44:59] <%CommanderSqueaks> It's like looking in a mirror
[2:45:00] <missingangle> I have my mirror on Spotify
[2:45:01] <ChungusQuest> it's a sound mirror
[2:45:01] <%iosephe> a mirror, huh?
[2:45:02] <%SaiyanShoto> You listen then see in the mirror
[2:45:02] <%DailyOkami> DailyOkami subscribed with Prime. They've subscribed for 4 months! 
[2:45:03] <Chuckgofer> Arin-uh
[2:45:03] <goblinpuppy> listening to a mirror is amazing
[2:45:04] <+KaijuUltimax> This relationship is sustained by your ability to just put the other on blast live
[2:45:05] <$Grimlockfly> Thanks Paige for proving this game is a baby game for babies. Much preferred Tekken in high school ShowLove200
[2:45:06] <CursedNobleman> oh dear LUL
[2:45:06] <insaneintentionsyo> lol

[2:45:15] <%Nitsorinni> Im genuienly sorry to hear that
[2:45:17] <+BeatBoxersDevMike> technically a mirror does reflect sound
[2:45:17] <weissguard> But Arin is TERRIBLE
[2:45:18] <CanadianAnimatorGuy> I watched that 2.5 hours Ocarina video and HOLY SHIT
[2:45:18] <ChrisPlaysThing> Voyager when?
[2:45:19] <mystrycarambola> like a mp3 file
[2:45:20] <insaneintentionsyo> I like super mega
[2:45:24] <Darren716> Why?
[2:45:24] <Senselessvirus> If twitch ever made it against the rules for someone other than the streamer to play the game this channel would die
[2:45:27] <AFlyingTaco1> Plague likes GAME GRUMPS???
[2:45:27] <%Keyd00d> ew
[2:45:28] <+NigglyDiggly> I didn't smell anything
[2:45:29] <%TUMZtwitch> He loves fruity pebbles in a major way?
[2:45:30] <+vdalson> wow that explains a lot about eli
[2:45:30] <@commanderclaw> Blame it on the dog
[2:45:32] <+condemned_15> Arin's opinion on 3D Zelda is shit
[2:45:33] <Zerenis> Game Grumps is ok. I wish they weren’t playing so much Dang Grandpa lately
[2:45:35] <Davo46> Wow Paige, WOW
[2:45:35] <%baronblank> game grumps can be great but man is arin bad at video games
[2:45:37] <%Keyd00d> Dan seems cool
[2:45:37] <TheRadIdeaMan> Once Arin stops being a dunce as a bit I'll watch
[2:45:37] <jellssssss20> That about suits Paiges mental level, that makes sense
[2:45:39] <$arcielardor> So Pat is Grump
[2:45:41] <%ssjklyco> Did you watch the Sonic LP where Danny read Sonic High School?
[2:45:41] <%CommanderSqueaks> Imagine if Peach and Arin both tried to double team Banjo Tooie.
[2:45:42] <Ell1ot> "it's like listening to a mirror" is a line in Kimmy Schmidt
[2:45:43] <BurdRightsActivist> GAME GRUMPS FUCKING SUCKS. You know what's a BETTER channel? Twobestfriendsplay! Man, I hope those guys never stop making videos PogChamp
[2:45:43] <s1rcuit> Arin's funny, but stupid, stubborn, and sometimes contrary
[2:45:45] <ChungusQuest> Arin's definitely in another bracket when it comes to stream tax
[2:45:46] <TalisKanju> Plague used to make Game Grumps animations so yeah
[2:45:47] <+skeletrail> He is BAD at videogmae
[2:45:50] <majindusto> ARIN IS AWFUL AT GAMES
[2:45:54] <SMuffinMan> I'M STUCK IN A PIT OF HIPPOPOTAMUS SHIT
[2:45:55] <%SaiyanShoto> Paige's stream is the fart stream
[2:45:57] <WinstonFromUndertale> 🥸
[2:46:02] <+MayorRev> Game grumps is just DSP but even less entertaining
[2:46:06] <+razielhex> RED PLANT. PURPLE PLANT.
[2:46:07] <+vaderxyz1970> I like Dan
[2:46:13] <+NigglyDiggly> dan is great
[2:46:14] <alvaroeltz> game grumps have their great moments
[2:46:15] <nmaten> i love dan
[2:46:15] <insaneintentionsyo> so slowbeef bawkKek
[2:46:15] <Darkfire346> But Suzie is still best streamer, right?
[2:46:16] <CanadianAnimatorGuy> yeah if you're 12 they're hilarious
[2:46:17] <Zerenis> Yeah, sadly Arin is quite terrible at games. Plus he willingly chooses to ignore tutorials
[2:46:17] <%CommanderSqueaks> @MayorRev Arin hasn't gotten caught masturbating on stream, yet.
[2:46:17] <majindusto> REMEMBER ZELDA SEQUELITIS?
[2:46:21] <SMuffinMan> I like GGs
[2:46:22] <TalisKanju> Do you make fun of yourself Pat?
[2:46:22] <Davo46> Danny is a treasure
[2:46:22] <DublinRage> cool. now make fun of Nyanners, because she's so good.
[2:46:23] <+BeatBoxersDevMike> Pat doesnt watch LPs confirmed
[2:46:23] <%superc37> tbf they are also stupid as FUCK
[2:46:24] <Kghaleon> I used to think 2snacks videos were about Gamegrumps
[2:46:24] <DillWillCat> Patrick you finish your Bamboo Calzone right this minute.
[2:46:26] <%DrkJP520> I don't think I've ever seen gamegrumps for whatever reason
[2:46:27] <%TheLemuroid> I have bought games they played out of spite for how bad Arin can be
[2:46:28] <RileyOMalley> Dan is an absolute darling
[2:46:29] <%Keyd00d> Kinda stopped watching like 4 years ago
[2:46:30] <SMuffinMan> Dan is a gem
[2:46:32] <walnutcast> @MayorRev you're going to win the award for worst take of the year and it's literally the first hour of 2021
[2:46:33] <$arcielardor> Let one rip into the mic to add some flare to the playthrough!
[2:46:36] <missingangle> I usually can deal with them playing bad, unless it's a favorite of mine. Them playing Thousand Year Door made me want to die
[2:46:39] <Zerenis> Dan is truly a treasure
[2:46:42] <%Kurgash> Game Grumps frustrated me with never finishing a game originally
[2:46:44] <MicrotonalMatt> Dan is better at games than Arin
[2:46:45] <vVAstrAVv> all dans sierra games are dope
[2:46:45] <+Rofiarf> so what your saying is arin holding him down?
[2:46:45] <Jetssam> outlasted the super best friends, BUH HUH
[2:46:45] <+razielhex> Slowbeef is a goon. LPs are goon made.
[2:46:46] <Darren716> I stopped watching GG even before Jon left
[2:46:47] <Daxalog> The space quest series were always good
[2:46:48] <nmaten> dan and ross playing kings quest and leisure suit larry are god tier lps
[2:46:52] <BurdRightsActivist> bambOO caslzojne
[2:46:54] <Zaphire_Saucypants> yeah...been a looong while since I last watched em.
[2:46:54] <missingangle> I want more Dan solo stuff, he's so good
[2:46:57] <CrimsonFox777> That's what you sound like Pat
[2:46:59] <+demon1103> Danny and Arin are hilarious .....but Arin's insistence on not paying attention to how to play games is astounding XD
[2:47:00] <+zodiark26> is that pat burping?
[2:47:07] <%Meidolaon> They used to be funny
[2:47:08] <Chuckgofer> I miss steam train
[2:47:08] <ChrisPlaysThing> and farting
[2:47:09] <insaneintentionsyo> it's all your fault beef insane120Ree
[2:47:12] <%CommanderSqueaks> @missingangle Unfortunately, Game Grumps fans are shit and make Dan not want to play.
[2:47:16] <CursedNobleman> clankers
[2:47:19] <Kghaleon> clankers?
[2:47:21] <Explodincatz> Swamp?
[2:47:22] <niozonbi> Clankers CAvern

[2:47:25] <%TUMZtwitch> bAMBOO CALZONE is genius
[2:47:27] <+jjeefberky> ya
[2:47:29] <Kghaleon> Clanker is basically just Pat
[2:47:31] <vVAstrAVv> clankers yeah
[2:47:31] <+dellakitty> Lust circle of hell
[2:47:32] <%TUMZtwitch> That's a band name.
[2:47:33] <JumbleJams> i actually dropped game grumps for best friends instead LUL
[2:47:33] <missingangle> @CommanderSqueaks dang, really? not surprised, tbh. fuck toxic fanbases
[2:47:35] <niozonbi> ayep
[2:47:36] <+logoth_> Clankers sounds like an STD
[2:47:38] <+ChestMimik> So Pat mocks the fart noises when there's ACTUAL belching?
[2:47:44] <SMuffinMan> My favorite Arin bit has gotta be Froggy from Sonic Adventure on Emerald Coast. Fucking legendary.
[2:47:45] <Doofmaster> to be fair I skipped Clanker's Cavern the first time I played
[2:47:46] <%CommanderSqueaks> @missingangle They were fucking relentless during his Paper Mario playthrough
[2:47:48] <%robobeau> Banjo, but everytime he gets a jiggy, he goes UwU
[2:47:52] <Darkfire346> That reminds me. you guys see theyre making a NEW Ratchet and Clank?
[2:47:54] <SomersaultJustice> Rusty Bucket Bay
[2:47:54] <niozonbi> You can play levels out of order with enough Jiggies
[2:47:58] <+rawblink> rusty bucket bay
[2:47:58] <%TUMZtwitch> Proof
[2:47:58] <MichelangeloStark> @peachsaliva want revenge on the shark? lure the shark and poop eggs while you're on land or you're on a crate
[2:47:58] <Davo46> youre probably thinking of RustyBucket Bay
[2:48:01] <insaneintentionsyo> oh piss off
[2:48:01] <+cvp5127> same
[2:48:03] <Louie_Salmon> It's fun, just don't get all the moons
[2:48:05] <%bob900000> galexy > odyssey
[2:48:05] <Kghaleon> Pat's only complaint about odyssey is the optional moons
[2:48:10] <Darren716> Whats wrong with the mirrors?
[2:48:12] <%Keyd00d> It's still good besides
[2:48:14] <Darren716> *moons
[2:48:15] <majindusto> REMEMBER WHEN PAT SHIT ON GAME GRUMPS AND SAID IT "BORED HIM TO TEARS" WHEN IT FIRST STARTED?
[2:48:16] <Blank9> 3D world is the best
[2:48:16] <@SoFarFetched> Pat is like "THERE'S TOO MUCH TO COLLECT"
[2:48:18] <laserbeaming> Odyssey is alright
[2:48:19] <%CommanderSqueaks> SPAAAAACE
[2:48:19] <+AbnormalVoid> Mario 3D World's controls suck
[2:48:19] <Blank9> odyssey is ok
[2:48:20] <nmaten> odyssey is great unless you have goblins
[2:48:20] <Zerenis> Yeah but Mario Odyssey gave us Mayor Pauline.
[2:48:22] <arancet> odysseys really good, its no galaxy, but still good
[2:48:22] <+cvp5127> 3d world is great
[2:48:23] <%bob900000> wow
[2:48:23] <+jjeefberky> a few years ago i was at my friends house and we put in the n64 and his banjo save had like 9802 hours and they were only on clankers
[2:48:23] <%rusttyphoon> 3D WORLD IS THE BEST
[2:48:24] <$mister___doctor> This is just like not true
[2:48:24] <critiquequartz> Rusty bucket bay?
[2:48:24] <Devbob98> It’s not a bummer, it’s alright
[2:48:24] <+BeatBoxersDevMike> Pat just hates all 3d platformers
[2:48:26] <%TheLemuroid> Everyone loved Odyssey when it came out
[2:48:27] <+skeletrail> Odyssey is great, what are you talking about
[2:48:27] <Rostichenburg> Why are the moons listed out of order and only unlockd at the end of the game!
[2:48:27] <%Ranryu692> everybody loves the New Donk City song
[2:48:28] <ammobasket> I don't care for odyssey
[2:48:28] <Neo_Kaiser> I just sent Pat a meme.
[2:48:28] <dots4eyes> Oh right the space bit
[2:48:29] <CrimsonFox777> @Darkfire346 The one with the new female Lombax that made everyone forget about Angela from Going Commando?
[2:48:29] <SomersaultJustice> space racism
[2:48:30] <Jetssam> well, 50% of the way through the game already
[2:48:32] <+darklordfodder> 3D World is great.
[2:48:33] <Doofmaster> Galaxy was exactly fine and super overrated
[2:48:35] <%HiroTSK5> 3D world is ok, preferred 3D land honestly
[2:48:36] <+Cattadope> odyssey is good, but galaxy is better, both 1 and 2
[2:48:36] <floornine> Pat you’re a bummer
[2:48:37] <+ChestMimik> I'm eh on Odyssey
[2:48:37] <Davo46> Paige PLAY OUTER WILDS!
[2:48:38] <+neutralraff> You can literally ignore most moons.
[2:48:39] <jumpyhugs> Odyssey rocks
[2:48:40] <Kghaleon> Guess what, Hat in time has plenty of useless collectables like those yarn balls.
[2:48:40] <gryffinp> I have to admit there was a moment where I went "SHE DOESN'T LIKE GA-" and then pat mentioned space and I went "Oh, right."
[2:48:41] <+Ascethetic> DK 64 is not THAT bad of a game, its just ALOT to colect
[2:48:42] <+darklordfodder> Pumped for the Switch release.
[2:48:42] <+Xooler67> so does pat just hate platformers in general?
[2:48:42] <ammobasket> Galaxy is meh
[2:48:43] <insaneintentionsyo> Pat, stream wind waker.
[2:48:43] <Chuckgofer> I want mayor pauline to step on me uwu
[2:48:44] <critiquequartz> It’s good pat? Yeah it’s bloated but it’s good
[2:48:46] <missingangle> Odyssey didn't give us Rosalina with a guitar as shown in its art book, therefore it sucks
[2:48:48] <%Keyd00d> I still haven't finished Galaxy 2. I guess Nintendo doesn't want me to either
[2:48:50] <$FluffiTamamo> Galaxy is kinda forgettable scottfTired
[2:48:51] <ChrisPlaysThing> Outer Wilds is Paige Poison
[2:48:52] <Blank9> odyssey is better than sunshine, but worse than the other 3D ones
[2:48:53] <%superc37> wait mom?
[2:48:54] <%bob900000> nope
[2:48:57] <MicrotonalMatt> Odyssey is ok but Pats right those moons are insane and jump rope and volleyball can go to hell
[2:48:58] <$Sphincter_Spelunker> @CrimsonFox777 I never forgot about Angela :(
[2:49:02] <Kghaleon> @FluffiTamamo Said noone
[2:49:05] <Darkfire346> @CrimsonFox777 yes, the one thats apparently a contiuation of the original PS3 games
[2:49:06] <%Promessa_EX> evamom or momoka
[2:49:07] <ChungusQuest> Pat make Paige play Outer Wilds next New Year's as revenge for tonight
[2:49:09] <+RunoEddie> I hate the planetoids, they ruin the game for me
[2:49:14] <nmaten> catJAM
[2:49:15] <%TUMZtwitch> I love space, but I hate being lost at sea.
[2:49:16] <%bob900000> odyssey is overrated
[2:49:16] <RyuuAoi> Jami
[2:49:20] <%DrkJP520> I have to keep my wii u for Metroid trilogy and galaxy 1 and 2
[2:49:21] <nmaten> oh no
[2:49:22] <RyuuAoi> Jank
[2:49:23] <+FuriousCabinBoy> if only galaxy didnt have the TERRIBLE wii motion controls
[2:49:24] <CandideCamera> how did you lose the jinjos twice
[2:49:29] <$FluffiTamamo> @Kghaleon Guess I better see if then name no one is available then.
[2:49:32] <Aleate> aaaand Pat gets ignored
[2:49:34] <CrimsonFox777> @Sphincter_Spelunker Me neither brother. FeelsBadMan
[2:49:36] <goblinpuppy> I do not get why people like the Mario 3D games, there's no variety
[2:49:42] <Doofmaster> @CandideCamera she walked into enemies over and over until she died
[2:49:48] <MicrotonalMatt> Minjos are where it’s at
[2:49:53] <%CommanderSqueaks> Galaxy is 'fine', Odyssey is much much better.
[2:49:54] <SMuffinMan> DK64 would be amazing if you didn't have to play every level five fucking times just to see the ending
[2:49:56] <+cvp5127> ?
[2:49:59] <SomeSageAdvice> there is no jigsaw for the shark
[2:50:00] <%Promessa_EX> this fov is like 35
[2:50:00] <%marvel877> I keep my Wii U because 1. I'm a collector and 2. I can play old Wii games on it via HDMI.
[2:50:02] <RetributionP> this sing singing is almost is as bad as Little V's baccus impression
[2:50:04] <+BeatBoxersDevMike> i dont think killing the shark does anything
[2:50:09] <+stephaniesadgirl> cheer500 Happy New Year! I need your advice, my girlfirned also has Lupus and is nearly falling apart at every moments. Is there anything I could do to like, make stuff less miserable when shes not feeling well due to it?

[2:53:18] <@commanderclaw> Truly Banjo Kazooie is the Dark Souls of collectathons
[2:53:18] <%Keyd00d> You had to be told how to beat it Pat
[2:53:20] <niozonbi> Good job Pat!
[2:53:20] <Louie_Salmon> Bark Kouls
[2:53:21] <damienlunas> Pat you're so good

[2:53:23] <+logoth_> PREY SLAUGHTERED
[2:53:25] <Profmcstevie> PREY VANQUISHED
[2:53:25] <Jaxnos> i like this tactic of tricking pat into playing more and more banjo
[2:53:26] <%CommanderSqueaks> This is clearly the dark souls of n64.
[2:53:26] <$DocMadfox> Pat's mad he couldn't figure it out.
[2:53:27] <%baronblank> this is for children he says after taking like 5 minutes to figure out how to hurt him with chat's help
[2:53:27] <+Cattadope> NIGHTMARE SLAIN
[2:53:28] <Kghaleon> Paige cleverly tricked him
[2:53:29] <insaneintentionsyo> yes
[2:53:29] <niozonbi> Pat so big and strong
[2:53:30] <missingangle> He did
[2:53:30] <%CommanderSqueaks> Yes

[2:53:38] <SomersaultJustice> he didn't 100% it though
[2:53:39] <KingKrampus> Paige is far more devious than she lets on
[2:53:39] <%Nitsorinni> The crab contains crabs?
[2:53:39] <Jetssam> gotta touchemrealquickandgo
[2:53:41] <+BeatBoxersDevMike> 2 grown adults cant figure it out for 2 minutes: "for children"

[2:54:42] <jaxondorf> CRAB BATTLE
[2:54:42] <majindusto> PAIGE WINS
[2:54:43] <+darklordfodder> Should have been the Wiii
[2:54:45] <%wolf34736> first try
[2:54:45] <laserbeaming> I'll be honest. I don't really like the N64. I like Majora's Mask though.
[2:54:48] <insaneintentionsyo> nooo
[2:54:50] <ammobasket> the big crab was two small crabs in a big shell!
[2:54:51] <Dragon_Batman> It's easier that it was a woman too Kappa
[2:54:51] <DillWillCat> Bok them eekums
[2:54:51] <WizardOfTheLawl> Usually it takes medicated shampoo
[2:54:52] <%Promessa_EX> there was some embarrasing crap in the galaxy 2 lp
[2:54:52] <rReizs> this song but with soulja boy
[2:54:53] <%stephaniesadgirl> It was Paige, she is big and strong and did it!
[2:54:54] <%Keyd00d> I'm just waiting on the 13S woolie stream
[2:54:55] <+MayorRev> I'll give pat credit, i expected him to be full on "make it stop" mbut instead he's just pouty baby
[2:54:56] <%Keyd00d> Soon
[2:55:01] <Zaphire_Saucypants> there's some dark shit in this game, Pat.
[2:55:02] <Xenioplate> she's doing her best
[2:55:05] <EsotericOdyssey> editing clips of the crab fight like those photos of stalin that progressively lose more people as they're doctored over and over
[2:55:06] <%SaiyanShoto> "dog"
[2:55:13] <insaneintentionsyo> this theme is so good
[2:55:20] <%CommanderSqueaks> Pat is trying really hard.
[2:55:25] <MichelangeloStark> the music is so good..
[2:55:26] <Davo46> THIS is his best?
[2:55:28] <AFlyingTaco1> That's awful then if this is his best
[2:55:29] <Louie_Salmon> But the music is so good
[2:55:29] <%StaceMcGate> extreme doubt
[2:55:31] <$Sphincter_Spelunker> no sex for a week
[2:55:33] <+jjeefberky> this is the perfect tone for video games
[2:55:35] <Chuckgofer> Makes sense its basically variations of teddy bear picnic
[2:55:36] <%GraceTBM> It feels like a circus and I hate it
[2:55:36] <%SaiyanShoto> Pats eyes are cluded by hate
[2:55:37] <+cvp5127> pats sass is bonus
[2:55:38] <+terraspan> The way Pat describes the game is exactly how Pat describes Zangief.
[2:55:39] <Dragon_Batman> It's always like that tho LUL
[2:55:40] <%SaiyanShoto> clouded
[2:55:42] <$KnivesEve> this is his best xD
[2:55:54] <%Promessa_EX> i think that was november
[2:56:01] <missingangle> Geez, that bad?
[2:56:04] <%stephaniesadgirl> If paige was stronger, she could carry pat around in a backpack like this
[2:56:05] <+logoth_> I have a bad case of the clankers
[2:56:06] <MichelangeloStark> @terraspan so pat loves banjo then?
[2:56:07] <%Keyd00d> This dialogue is great
[2:56:07] <%SaiyanShoto> It's fine
[2:56:07] <laserbeaming> it's not THAT bad
[2:56:08] <%TUMZtwitch> Can't teach an old little hobo new tricks. Can't stop him.
[2:56:09] <Louie_Salmon> Yeah but this music is good so there's no problem
[2:56:11] <KingKrampus> It's okay Pat, we know you have no taste
[2:56:12] <MichelangeloStark> rawr
[2:56:14] <Zerenis> It’s almost like taste in music is subjective and screaming at someone they should like something will only make them like it less
[2:56:18] <jaxondorf> Pat, this came out for the Nintendo 64 man. This is a huge jump from the VIRTUAL BOY!
[2:56:21] <PrettyThickandStrongDyck> BL3 story is shit
[2:56:22] <%SaiyanShoto> It's like a Mel Brooks greek movie
[2:56:22] <+Whiskey_T_Foxtrot> I played a few Ubisoft games recently and was shocked how bad their dialogue is. They're all, like, Dragon Age 2 levels of bad
[2:56:22] <nivlac_555> EEKUM BOKUM PAT
[2:56:23] <mudamudajo> BUT ADAM JENSEN IS IN IT!!!
[2:56:24] <Aleate> The enemies in BL3 need to just shut the fuck up
[2:56:24] <$Sphincter_Spelunker> wasn't Immortals the name change or am I thinking of another game?
[2:56:24] <+jjeefberky> never compare this to borderlands again
[2:56:24] <EsotericOdyssey> got I hate borderlands writing
[2:56:26] <%baronblank> I'll agree about borderlands at least
[2:56:27] <WhatzePh> Immortals is funny, Pat is just crazy
[2:56:27] <Dragon_Batman> I've seen a bit of that Max really likes it but it doesn't really impress me
[2:56:28] <EsotericOdyssey> all borderlands writing
[2:56:28] <ChrisPlaysThing> Not every game has to take itself seriously Pat
[2:56:30] <%CommanderSqueaks> Pat, would you be okay with this game if the sound effects were turned off?
[2:56:37] <Laecerelius> Dialogue would’ve been fine if it wasn’t so fucking constant
[2:56:38] <+terraspan> @michelangelostark It's the only logical conclusion.
[2:56:39] <Syrushmx> lol
[2:56:41] <CursedNobleman> fair. LUL
[2:56:41] <%TUMZtwitch> To me?
[2:56:41] <+MarshallLee67> LUL
[2:56:43] <Zerenis> That’s fair
[2:56:44] <Doofmaster> I don't understand Borderlands 3's choice to replace humour with embarrassing and cringeworthy attempts at humour
[2:56:46] <majindusto> PAT BEING FAIR? HA!
[2:56:46] <ammobasket> BL2 is not great either. wait I never finished 1 either
[2:56:46] <MichelangeloStark> @terraspan indeed
[2:56:47] <%TUMZtwitch> Annoying
[2:56:51] <%TUMZtwitch> LUL
[2:56:51] <laserbeaming> is this the same as Diablo then?
[2:56:51] <Louie_Salmon> I mean, that's technically true I guess
[2:56:52] <Vaardvark> if you think about it monster hunter is basically a pokemon clone
[2:56:52] <%TUMZtwitch> <3
[2:56:52] <wibbwobbler> try hard dialogue
[2:56:55] <VritraReiRei> Wait, when did you play Immortals Fenyx Rising!?
[2:57:01] <insaneintentionsyo> klinkButta
[2:57:02] <%Keyd00d> This game is basically an MMO
[2:57:03] <SMuffinMan> Paaaatuh
[2:57:04] <ChrisPlaysThing> Just stop playing, that should fix it Kappa
[2:57:04] <+Cattadope> based on his tweets the other day, pat seems to be enjoying this compared to my expectations
[2:57:04] <Kghaleon> You know there's a non emulated version of this game.
[2:57:05] <+FuriousCabinBoy> oh yeah the combat of BL3 is fine, but the dialogue is fuckin terrible
[2:57:07] <+Dunmarkh> Banjo kazooie is the demon's souls of borderlands
[2:57:07] <RyuuAoi> Jank
[2:57:08] <insaneintentionsyo> exposed
[2:57:10] <@commanderclaw> Why does Paige talk in a whiny voice when she wants things?
[2:57:10] <jaxondorf> the jittering is odd
[2:57:12] <Louie_Salmon> @VirtuaRailith I think it was for like an hour one stream
[2:57:14] <+Rocket_Luffy> enulation started
[2:57:14] <nivlac_555> happy new year, guh-huh
[2:57:15] <SomeSageAdvice> he played it awhile ago like around the beginning of december i think?
[2:57:18] <Darkfire346> I'm 3 minutes till 2021 myseelf
[2:57:20] <goblinpuppy> here
[2:57:21] <Chuckgofer> As if 2021 isn't just 2020-2
[2:57:22] <jowi_time> happy new year everyone!!
[2:57:22] <%CommanderSqueaks> @Doofmaster Well when you abuse and fire all of the people who wrote the good dialogue in 2...
[2:57:23] <laserbeaming> Banjo Kazooie is Diablo: Confirmed.
[2:57:23] <+Dunder_Mifflinz> I used to binge the heck out of this, Banjo Tooie and F-Zero X as a kid
[2:57:24] <goblinpuppy> right here
[2:57:25] <SMuffinMan> PAAAAAAATUH
[2:57:27] <dohrge> julesBanjo julesBanjo julesBanjo
[2:57:28] <%Keyd00d> hello I am here
[2:57:29] <vinceshamwowslap> eugeniParty
[2:57:30] <BurdRightsActivist> fix it by playing a new game 4Head
[2:57:30] <RyuuAoi> Happy New Year! artesi1Rgbheart
[2:57:31] <Xenioplate> Pat if you liked Far Cry Blood Dragon Dialogue at all, you can't talk shit
[2:57:32] <%bob900000> still 2020 where I'm at
[2:57:35] <laserbeaming> Platformer Diablo
[2:57:36] <@SoFarFetched> @VritraReiRei he played it during one of his Wasteland 3 streams ,around 2 weeks ago
[2:57:37] <Doofmaster> does BL3 still lag like hell when you ADS?
[2:57:37] <%Bane_Kaikyo> FUCK YOU IT'S JANUARY!!
[2:57:39] <Darkfire346> Central
[2:57:42] <insaneintentionsyo> the Xbox port saves your progress in the levels
[2:57:45] <dots4eyes> We're basically time travelling
[2:57:47] <Louie_Salmon> It's still an hour away for me
[2:57:47] <Xenioplate> happy future nerds
[2:57:49] <%Promessa_EX> mountain is next hour
[2:57:49] <%bob900000> 9:58 here
[2:57:49] <Kghaleon> It's only 10:58PM
[2:57:50] <+consistentlylistless> I still got an hour
[2:57:51] <david9593> not for me
[2:57:51] <MichelangeloStark> @xenioplate he will excuse it as it's so bad it's good
[2:57:54] <+cvp5127> the future sucks
[2:57:55] <+ChestMimik> Paige can't see us
[2:57:56] <s1rcuit> Central's 2mins away
[2:57:57] <EsotericOdyssey> @PeachSaliva Pat used to hang out with nerds in high school who loved borderlands and I never understood what the appeal was but they thought the psycho character from 2 was like, cool and deep, and they'd just scream his non-sequitur quotes in fucking public like when we were going to the lan place and it made me wanna die
[2:57:58] <+Horseengineer> banjo kazooie was a horrible game, but then crazy talk kicked in and now it's good
[2:57:58] <+Chester_goes_Berserk> ya ha ha
[2:57:59] <CrimsonFox777> Eastern, then Central, then Mountain, then Pacific
[2:58:00] <rosencruez> central
[2:58:01] <%TUMZtwitch> CENTRAL
[2:58:02] <%FacetiousAF> so basically paige is a huge racist for playing the game
[2:58:04] <%TUMZtwitch> Yup
[2:58:05] <+BeatBoxersDevMike> the main appeal of Rare 3d platormers are that every corner is a unique character or enemy or challenge
[2:58:06] <EsotericOdyssey> *Pat I used to
[2:58:08] <Chuckgofer> West coast people other time zones exis
[2:58:09] <Kghaleon> Mountain time > Weak coasts
[2:58:12] <clockworkidiot> it's almost like time is made up bullshit
[2:58:12] <%VoidBaronJules> 4:58pm 1/1/20 here
[2:58:13] <Darkfire346> CENTRAL TIME BEST TIME
[2:58:17] <david9593> 9:58 here in California

[2:58:27] <%Keyd00d> oobada
[2:58:29] <+rawblink> OOOH ME NOCKA
[2:58:33] <+Dunder_Mifflinz> It's a Metroidvania!
[2:58:36] <leinadtonu> Zimbabwe
[2:58:36] <Zerenis> That’s certainly a mechanic
[2:58:44] <Louie_Salmon> New character from collectibles, just like Pat wanted
[2:58:46] <shmo7707> "you cum when ready" shmo77Yes
[2:58:49] <%juxtest> How disgusting
[2:58:49] <damienlunas> You're paying for Mumbo's Early Access Magic
[2:58:54] <%Keyd00d> LUL'
[2:58:55] <%CommanderSqueaks> He learned from his mother!
[2:58:56] <EsotericOdyssey> he's dreaming
[2:58:57] <critiquequartz> Pat you can be big dinosaur in the second one
[2:58:58] <EsotericOdyssey> of ham
[2:58:58] <%wydamn> basically animorphs
[2:58:59] <Jetssam> OOH ME NACKER
[2:59:00] <+teh_rawk> is it 2021 yet?
[2:59:04] <SomeSageAdvice> actually now that i get a better look at Mumbo, why does he look like he is made of tongue flesh? that texturing is nightmarish
[2:59:05] <arancet> STOP SNORING LSEEPING DOG
[2:59:15] <SomersaultJustice> so does pat know if you don't collect all the notes in a stage and die/leave the level you have to collect them all over again?
[2:59:17] <+ChestMimik> Ah so this is bugsnax
[2:59:19] <%TUMZtwitch> Loud puppy LUL
[2:59:19] <dots4eyes> Don't mind this tiny termite with shorts
[2:59:21] <critiquequartz> Also a clothes washer
[2:59:22] <Zaphire_Saucypants> Pat, you should love Banjo Kazooie. At some point you turn into a toilet. Or was that a washing machine...
[2:59:23] <goblinpuppy> Why is that quote so gos samn memorable?
[2:59:25] <+terraspan> that jump sucks
[2:59:26] <MichelangeloStark> this is the ORIGINAL music for mumbos mountain but slowed down before it was replaced with what you hear in the game now
[2:59:27] <%CommanderSqueaks> Peach "STOP SNORING DOG" Also Peach "ZZZZZZZZZZZZZZSNOOOOORE"
[2:59:28] <goblinpuppy> *god damn
[2:59:29] <Jaxnos> w h e e - termite banjo, 2020

[2:59:35] <+Dunmarkh> HAPPY NEW YEAR
[2:59:36] <SomeSageAdvice> oh yeah i let him know @SomersaultJustice and Paige said its fine
[2:59:39] <%Ranryu692> Invading people's land, destroying their homes, and killing them? It's almost like Rare is an English studio
[2:59:46] <+Dunmarkh> AGAIN
[2:59:51] <+condemned_15> Happy New Year!
[2:59:51] <gryffinp> termite platforming

[3:00:28] <majindusto> Not Yet New Years here (Mountain Time)
[3:00:29] <laserbeaming> Are the eggs fertilized?

[3:00:30] <EsotericOdyssey> what does kazooie turn into when banjo transforms
[3:00:36] <EsotericOdyssey> is she just a termite grub in that backpack

[3:01:32] <Blank9> time for 2021 to be just as bad, but without the january and february letting you relax
[3:01:33] <david9593> still 10:01 in CA
[3:01:35] <walnutcast> kazooie is just a personality engram inside of banjo's cyberware
[3:01:37] <Louie_Salmon> Definitely a star trek transporter accident situation
[3:01:39] <+Horseengineer> it's like jojolion
[3:01:44] <majindusto> 11:02 here
[3:01:49] <TurtlesAndTentacles> HAPPY NEW YEAR!!!
[3:01:51] <Darkfire346> I'm going to eat an entire bag of Hersheys chocolate tomorrow
[3:01:52] <Boxbunnytheliar> Considering Tooie has a transformation that's Kazooie only I assume it's banjo only in these cases
[3:01:52] <jaxondorf> banjo and Kazooi are gay and in love
[3:01:53] <Kghaleon> couldn't it walk on water?
[3:01:53] <+RealThiele> kazooie is a maggot in the pack is my lore
[3:01:56] <MichelangeloStark> NYA HA HA
[3:01:56] <EdHeng> Happy New Year chat!
[3:02:03] <goblinpuppy> I get the fall damage but why breathing underwater?
[3:02:05] <+zacyzacy> clakclakclak
[3:02:08] <+Cattadope> why the fuck can a termite breathe underwater, but a bear cant?
[3:02:18] <Rostichenburg> We need Janeway to unfise Banjooie
[3:02:23] <%CommanderSqueaks> @Cattadope Have you ever seen a termite drown?
[3:02:23] <+bassforte123> insects tend to last a long time without breathing dont' they?
[3:02:23] <Louie_Salmon> You can just keep going yeah
[3:02:24] <+tennouh> is paige a banjo kazooie speedrunner now?
[3:02:25] <ammobasket> you can walk away
[3:02:25] <+Chester_goes_Berserk> nope
[3:02:28] <niozonbi> You don't need to go back
[3:02:28] <+terraspan> @cattadope It's magic
[3:02:32] <$FluffiTamamo> Speaking of big-ass bugs, EDF 5 is like half off for winter steam sale. A game that apparently never got discounted for anything since launch.
[3:02:32] <+BeatBoxersDevMike> you can just walk away
[3:02:33] <+FuriousCabinBoy> YEAH TEAR THAT SCREEN
[3:02:35] <%MaddyCaddy> Pat tired
[3:02:35] <DagetStreams> Must be a problem with the...uh...console
[3:02:37] <%Keyd00d> that eye
[3:02:46] <Zerenis> I will give the game credit. Being able to leave a world in a changed form is an interesting mechanic.
[3:02:56] <Rostichenburg> Why not just play the Rare replay version that sucks less?
[3:02:59] <CursedNobleman> so what instrument is the fart horn anyhow?
[3:03:07] <+Cattadope> @CommanderSqueaks ive seen some shit...now theres a tuff one...
[3:03:14] <%CommanderSqueaks> @CursedNobleman A Kazoo...ie :3
[3:03:16] <%Keyd00d> They have no xbox

[3:03:33] <DagetStreams> What do you MEAN he's bleeding?!
[3:03:33] <%doowopshabop> fart horn tuba?
[3:03:33] <%SaiyanShoto> Banjo is making Pat bleed!
[3:03:36] <+jjeefberky> lmao

[3:03:42] <%CommanderSqueaks> Did Pat's nose explode?
[3:03:42] <+jjeefberky> too much cocaine
[3:03:42] <%bob900000> oh no
[3:03:43] <%UvBenServed> PatBleedsAt

[3:31:53] <+consistentlylistless> But I get all my medical advice from streamers
[3:31:53] <%Alazull> Disclaimer: Paige is not a doctor, or a lawyer, and is at times barely a person
[3:31:53] <%CommanderSqueaks> Peach you're in the hospital constantly, I thought it was because you moonlight as a doctor.
[3:31:53] <+Diabetic> Can't eat a bread, diabetes :(
[3:31:54] <+NWR_James> "Just mute my streams" - Paige

[3:32:36] <%marvel877> EAT A NICE GREASY BURGER
[3:32:37] <blue8moon> Part of the reason I don't drink is because I get headaches all the time so I have to take something for it LUL

[3:32:52] <$Sphincter_Spelunker> gatorade, it's got what plants crave
[3:32:53] <%ArtemisM822> I just said tipsy
[3:32:53] <%marvel877> Milk kinda helps but not by much.
[3:32:54] <%JJCheeker> Don't forget to take your opium
[3:32:54] <Dhurkst> To prevent hangovers, drink 3 pints of water before bed. Hangovers are caused by dehydration.
[3:32:55] <%Alazull> Milk is great if you want to puke ASAP
[3:32:56] <CatmanIX> careful with that shit tho
[3:32:56] <BoxNavy> PAT
[3:32:57] <ghostofsolomon> @PeachSaliva why are yours and Pat's stream not given enough credit for being cautious and responsible
[3:32:59] <Dr_Angelic> holy cow this music, what a juxtaposition
[3:32:59] <%Promessa_EX> i'm reading ibuprofen and asprin are safe
[3:33:00] <+akscully> no acetimetophin! that's processed through the liver

[3:33:38] <Profmcstevie> "eat your veggies, be kind to each other, punch a wolf"

[3:33:43] <Kiari13> i really wish that was real
[3:33:47] <+logoth_> those zangief noises
[3:33:48] <noahkabaz> it is 2021
[3:33:48] <ghostofsolomon> yes
[3:33:50] <wujak> i want that real bad
[3:33:51] <$Sphincter_Spelunker> Murphey's Law. What can go wrong, will
[3:33:51] <%marvel877> I've had about a pint of rum and I'm drinking about 3 and a half pints of water to combat that.
[3:33:51] <%Ranryu692> that would be awesome
[3:33:55] <mike2hands> Fuck you is january!!!!!!!
[3:33:56] <%maenos2> that would only end horribly
[3:33:56] <SomeSageAdvice> on our end? that actually kinda would be really neat?
[3:33:57] <%walternatorz> I mean, you have master volume control on your end
[3:33:58] <Kiari13> i can't hear a damn thing on jerma's stream and literally EVERYONE ELSE has perfect audio
[3:33:58] <Explodincatz> thats OBS's job
[3:33:59] <wujak> send two audio tracks
[3:33:59] <theloganbrand> extensions let you do tht
[3:33:59] <OneThousandTomatoes> i would like that but it seemed hard to set up
[3:34:01] <%ssjklyco> When they can control their DMCA bots
[3:34:01] <goblinpuppy> that would be cool but I feel Twitch would break it constantly
[3:34:02] <T_Sasquatch> LUL what ??
[3:34:03] <Cynical_Canadian> That's my question, how would it work
[3:34:05] <SomersaultJustice> like an obs plugin or something
[3:34:05] <%JJCheeker> Don't forget to take your teamocil
[3:34:07] <ammobasket> no, voice clips would be clean
[3:34:07] <%TheLemuroid> Thanks ideas guy
[3:34:10] <%maenos2> giving us ANY sort of control would be horrible
[3:34:10] <ghostofsolomon> VIEWERS SHUD BE RESPONSIBLE AS WELL
[3:34:12] <%VoidBaronJules> sounds cool, but wouldn't you have to out put both sources of audio
[3:34:12] <Profmcstevie> 2 audio tracks that the user would control? Sounds neat, help with visually impaired implements
[3:34:20] <leinadtonu> I can mute the stream... if needed.
[3:34:20] <%YakumoYomi> How would that work? Separate the streamer's audio from the game's audio on Twitch's end?
[3:34:21] <+MidnightBurst12> stream two sets of audio?
[3:34:24] <Louie_Salmon> Isn't that totally their current plan? To implement two audio tracks?
[3:34:27] <Dhurkst> SCREM
[3:34:28] <Vikingincognito> Happy new years everyone! Im here because Im terribly lonely and I badly need to pretend I'm spending new years with people
[3:34:29] <blue8moon> if it was possible, it would be nice
[3:34:33] <%Ranryu692> only for a few years. then theyd learn
[3:34:35] <dots4eyes> I think there are more pressing matters that will obviously NOT be addressed because reasons
[3:34:41] <%MaddyCaddy> That one is okay
