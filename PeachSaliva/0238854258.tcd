[0:12:41] <The_Gonzales_Experience> pisson the mat!!!!
[0:12:42] <Sunstalker> When a man pees, some might leak out the urethra later. And soemtimes it stays in and causes burning sensation
[0:12:42] <MonsterEnvy> by mistake it happens
[0:12:43] <On_Target> it's called the piss shivers
[0:12:43] <RipSlamsteak> the BIG PENIS is TOO BIG to CONTROL

[0:12:49] <ArcanumMBD> Not on purpose. sometimes the stream just shoots off to the side at the start on its own
[0:12:49] <SkyPirateArcane> That's how it works Paige
[0:12:49] <%Freelance7> I hate it when my piss splits in two directions
[0:12:49] <+LGWPhanto> Sometimes the stream splits
[0:12:49] <@thenefftw> It happens
[0:12:49] <Valkyrjsen> Sometimes your dick is just a little sicky on the inside and piss flies everywhere.
[0:12:50] <sosuke5> that's how it works
[0:12:51] <+shabop> that is hoew it works
[0:12:51] <justnymare> thats a life fact
[0:12:51] <Chimeraelite> Sometimes it's pointing in the toilet but the stream goes off to the left @PeachSaliva
[0:12:52] <%Remery_> you never had a dick paige!!
[0:12:52] <%Intersceptre> uncircumsized dicks you may as well piss through a sausage skin, you cant calculate the angles and water tension

[0:12:53] <Solidus_Nate> @PeachSaliva sometimes there's 2 streams
[0:12:53] <+Suplex9000> Tell her about the double streams
[0:12:53] <saikousuplex> LUL
[0:12:53] <TaifuDragon> @PeachSaliva sometimes it splits the streams at diagonal angles
[0:12:54] <Daniel_Is_I> It doesn't happen to me
[0:12:54] <Hydrapissed> HELL YEAH TELL HER about BONER PISS @PeachSaliva
[0:12:55] <+phatmac16> Yupp
[0:12:55] <+JustbeJake> Women dont understand they always sitting
[0:12:56] <%Dingalow> Paige disagrees with facts
[0:12:56] <Benpower236> IT TOTALLY HAPPENS!
[0:12:56] <devanmuse> No one pisses on the floor INTENTIONALLY! That doesn't mean it doesn't happen
[0:12:56] <%masterhobbes> Paige it 100% is.
[0:12:56] <$ImasukyLomae> Paige you yty peeing standing up
[0:12:56] <paiges_bloody_uterus> Ass
[0:12:56] <Quibbis> It super happens Paige
[0:12:57] <Jacknzack27> Yup
[0:12:58] <Tarkara> It totally can actually come out in different directions
[0:12:58] <KingGuthorm> In Pat's defence Paige, you don't have a penis
[0:12:58] <@corn_on_fire> that is EXACTLY how it works
[0:12:58] <elementofloyalty> Yes
[0:12:58] <EuropantLamprey> Paige, Pat is the one with the Dick
[0:12:59] <+Aggro_Will> Is this the Pat-n-Paige Watersports Hour?!
[0:12:59] <+maskedriderhero> Peach, you have no penis, how are you argueing about this
[0:12:59] <%TenaciousLeeOfficial> It's common, Paige
[0:12:59] <+other_badger> paige help pat piss if you don't believe im
[0:12:59] <Crashfan01> it's a real thing!
[0:13:00] <SchroedingersFerret> It's true
[0:13:00] <lux_argentis> It's not a snake pat
[0:13:00] <%Kashi_Nin> don't forget the crazy randome direction post-party steam
[0:13:01] <thelovingfool> sometimes the stream just splits
[0:13:01] <Metballs> 100% real
[0:13:01] <+AbsoluteUppercut> That means paige officially lives there now
[0:13:01] <sirtommygunn> ok listen, sometimes you pee on the floor, the bad thing isn't pissing on the floor, it's not cleaning up afterward
[0:13:02] <StarSkullyman> Paige learn physics
[0:13:02] <alwayspronking> sometimes, there are things we can't feel in the pee hole, and oopsie
[0:13:03] <StynCity> it's only a real thing for people who can't look down and see their penis
[0:13:03] <umm_idunno> sometime it goes in multiple directions
[0:13:03] <@ckbooks> Yeah ask random guys.
[0:13:03] <megamonmon123> @peachsaliva you dont have a penis Paige, you wouldnt know
[0:13:04] <Sunstalker> ITS A REAL THING PAIGE dicks leak
[0:13:04] <lethallunacyx> it's very frustrating
[0:13:04] <elementofloyalty> Sexual harrasment
[0:13:04] <Wireframefool> Seriously sometimes your pee just doesn't work good
[0:13:05] <SaltyDongs> There are so many variables Paige it is the truth
[0:13:05] <%Freelance7> The penis is weird
[0:13:07] <Habblewater> If you don't have a big turgid penis you wouldn't know you butthole
[0:13:07] <Jacknzack27> Face the truth
[0:13:07] <Metballs> Sometimes it comes out in two streams
[0:13:08] <Skipmich> you dont have a penis Paige
[0:13:09] <CashBanooca> HE’S SUPER RIGHT
[0:13:09] <%TeamSe7yn> !hookerclock
[0:13:10] <SirSmudgey> Paige doesn't get man problems
[0:13:11] <Lion_kun> Piss on the floor is better to look at than those ugly boots.
[0:13:11] <BasedRyuko> you dont have a dick to know our PISS SUFFERING paige
[0:13:12] <+Comrade_Vladof> Sometimes the piss just shoots off in a random direction for seemingly no reason
[0:13:12] <elementofloyalty> Ugh
[0:13:13] <MetalBrains92> Sometimes the bathroom light won't turn on and you just ballpark it
[0:13:14] <$Ralfclogs> Is true
[0:13:15] <+OdysseyKnight> Sometimes your dick is aiming elsewhere despite how it may appear
[0:13:15] <avakadosourdoutoast> I made the right choice to watch this rather than work on my essay.
[0:13:15] <%TrevyWeaponsGuy> Paige, sometimes the nozzle is pointed or forked in a weird way
[0:13:17] <iamalittleboat> sometimes theres knots inside the peepee :(
[0:13:18] <Schuhart> That's why people should sit down, Paige!
[0:13:18] <YO_WHADUP> sometimes the fireman is asleep at the hose
[0:13:20] <Benpower236> Gross, hot jockz.
[0:13:20] <elementofloyalty> Dont you hug me
[0:13:22] <codussalpha> have you ever woken up one morning and were so cold that when you pee it feels like your dicks on fire cause the piss is so hot in comparison?
[0:13:22] <ape_hawk> hey @PeachSaliva pat, thoughts on Pillars 2: Eothas Boogeloo getting delayed a month?
[0:13:25] <%FaultyJawa> Dude you can have the best angle in the world and the pee will just go "LOL fuck you" and come out in a totally dumb direction

[0:45:41] <@thenefftw> The pie
[0:45:42] <ToxInjection> but do we want her to skip the boss though
[0:45:43] <misterspotswood> full heelz
[0:45:45] <Hawkbone_> Pat just straight up lying
[0:45:46] <+Toblo1> ITS MAH BOI
[0:45:48] <Too_Much_Nukie> Pat is lying on purpose.
[0:45:50] <$googleygareth> Put on an old voice!
[0:45:51] <MonsterEnvy> Spider Donut only heals 12 it's not a full heal
[0:45:53] <Parapattern> Very subtle Pat ;)
[0:45:54] <Sochin_Iitsu> I love Pat's lies
[0:45:54] <GohanEgret> gwassesss
[0:45:56] <Valkyrjsen> I hipe Pat let's her fight her once at least.
[0:45:56] <elementofloyalty> Pats mom in game
[0:45:57] <zucchinibread> not really a lie?
[0:45:58] <%Keyd00d> Best turt
[0:45:58] <Daniel_Is_I> Pat she has the pie, get her to put it back too
[0:45:59] <+TechGamer> love this song
[0:46:00] <%firworks> I don't want her to use the donut in the specific spot where she could use the donut. That battle is awesome
[0:46:01] <Aninidas> get glasses
[0:46:02] <laguerrilha> Pat is so sneaky, good job
[0:46:03] <FrustratedAF> yeah the spider donut needs saved Kappa
[0:46:05] <mothdude> Have you seen Paige? Without the spide donut she may never get past Muffet.
[0:46:05] <ckangaroo15k> Thats good for paige..
[0:46:07] <$Aztec50> Does that mean Undyne is a ghost cause she lives in the ghost zone?
[0:46:09] <Darren716> Paige needs that
[0:46:10] <@thenefftw> @PeachSaliva Maybe put the pie away too
[0:46:10] <MainMan_Jonadiah> I swear to god if they use the donut for THAT, I'm gunna be upset.
[0:46:10] <elementofloyalty> Keep
[0:46:11] <@corn_on_fire> you need that for sure
[0:46:13] <buffmurffy> get the notebook thouggh
[0:46:13] <%2017y> cloudy glasses wtf
[0:46:13] <Hawkbone_> Paige cannot dodge things, pat.
[0:46:15] <SaltyDongs> Gg
[0:46:15] <LoganWulfric> Let her play the game guys gawd
[0:46:19] <Hawkbone_> Have you SEEN her?
[0:46:20] <%xijiy> Get the notebook pat
[0:46:21] <Idon__> She ate the pie didn't she
[0:46:22] <ToxInjection> To be fair, that boss fight is probably gonna destroy Paige if Papyrus gave her trouble.
[0:46:23] <SirSmudgey> Get the notebook its a weapon
[0:46:23] <%CitrusDrink> get the notebook you clowns
[0:46:23] <aeonicvector> notebook tho....
[0:46:26] <SwindlerOfProgress> Paige is bad at abusing her i-frames.
[0:46:26] <aeonicvector> she needs the iframes
[0:46:27] <@corn_on_fire> lets be real, paige is gonna get hit. just abuse the i frames
[0:46:27] <CactusChef3> get the notebooook
[0:46:28] <autismweaponised> torn notebook is just a straight buff
[0:46:29] <Louie_Salmon> Cloudy glasses are alright, notebook is sweet though
[0:46:30] <%xijiy> It helps her stay invincible longer and she doesnt attack
[0:46:31] <elementofloyalty> jerking motion
[0:46:32] <Shazzlnet> Torn Notebook doesn't drop defense
[0:46:34] <%SpookySpaghooti> Hey chatbois she needs to keep the donut so she can cheese a later boss
[0:46:37] <Valkyrjsen> Gerson, the First Historian.
[0:46:38] <jayordanny> @LoganPayne let people talk. She isn't reading chat. lol white knights smh
[0:46:38] <Jacknzack27> Get the notebook for invincible frames
[0:46:39] <hkey_local_machine> She will NOT find Temmie village. Chat will be SO mad. :)
[0:46:40] <Shazzlnet> she doesn't need ATK
[0:46:41] <%CitrusDrink> look at the chat and notice we are all telling you to get the notebook
[0:46:42] <grouchio> You suuuuure?
[0:46:44] <+CJett92> Paige is stroking out
[0:46:46] <+Hilleltaco> @PeachSaliva Reiterating a thing I said last stream, no point in the donut thing you may be trying for unless you want to completely skip a thing, which doesn't seem great for a first playthrough
[0:46:47] <%Andrizzleton> What are the known buffs of the boots now?
[0:46:50] <+Toblo1> Torn Notebook is worth taking since its its passive is also the invincibility frame
[0:46:50] <@TanktopNerd> Yellow controller is her favorite huh?
[0:46:51] <Hawkbone_> @PeachSaliva Pat, do you REALLY trust Paige to dodge the attacks?
[0:46:55] <+LoganPayne> @jayordanny what'd i do?
[0:46:56] <elementofloyalty> Yellow controller
[0:46:57] <Parapattern> Paige needs the Temmie armor STAT
[0:46:57] <Sochin_Iitsu> Dualshock is better than Xbox controllers
[0:46:57] <AncelDeLambert> I'm gonna be so sad if she doesn't meet TEHM!
[0:46:57] <Prevot> NotLikeThis just use the damn d-pad
[0:46:58] <MainMan_Jonadiah> I don't understand why people like the thing with the donut so much, it's neat, but you're actually ruining an AWESOME fight with it.
[0:47:00] <thelonechris> I think the boots are cutting off circulation
[0:47:01] <AncelDeLambert> HOI!
[0:47:01] <autismweaponised> notebook grants bonus iframes
[0:47:01] <calder87> pat is wise not to get after paige for being particular about controllers
[0:47:02] <OhioNitsud> oh princess likes her special gold controller, eh?
[0:47:03] <Idon__> It's a DPad, Paige....
[0:47:04] <elementofloyalty> Beta rune
[0:47:11] <ancrest_tant> You know, the tacky colored one
[0:47:11] <%krawtch> someone is having a marginally different experience with the game than I did! better spew cancerous aids out of my cringe-kingdom asshole -- fans
[0:47:14] <The_Gonzales_Experience> delta rune = under tale
[0:47:17] <arcadeHemorrhage > Fluffybuns
[0:47:18] <RafflesiaA> The donut thing is at least good as a last resort
[0:47:19] <+Toblo1> The Delta Rune is really good though
[0:47:27] <megamonmon123> @krawtch welcome to fandoms
[0:47:28] <Louie_Salmon> @Hilleltaco I think Pat is going to let Paige do the fight, and then let her use the donut if she needs it. He's doing a good job guiding gently
[0:47:32] <ToxInjection> She could always just watch a video of the boss after she beats the game. Chances are she'll just end up being frustrated by the end of it and want to move on with the plot.
[0:47:34] <SirSmudgey> Buy the notebook, its the best weapon for pacifist
[0:47:36] <Stegersaurus> wouldn't the symbol count as a form of written history?
[0:47:37] <$PonyHearts> No
[0:47:39] <%krawtch> @megamonmon123 hard pass
[0:47:43] <Sochin_Iitsu> I'll be honest she's going to be on that thing for awhile without the donut
[0:47:45] <topendbuzz> LUL
[0:47:45] <%masterhobbes> <3

[0:47:50] <Too_Much_Nukie> You're not an angel Paige.
[0:47:54] <megamonmon123> @krawtch yeah all fanbases are cancer
[0:47:55] <+Hilleltaco> @Louie_Salmon Hopefully, that sounds like a good idea
[0:47:56] <%bluetocho13> did they patch in that new dialogue thing
[0:47:57] <saikousuplex> DEBIRUMAN

[0:49:47] <AncelDeLambert> she'll expand the residue AFTER she finds Tehm, you freaks
[0:49:47] <ThatDangSkeleton> did you find out what the residue is good for?
[0:49:49] <mothdude> She should buy healing items from gerson.
[0:49:50] <Jolly_Adventurer> Hey guys, have I missed anything major?
[0:49:53] <thebehatted> well clearly that's not true
[0:49:53] <Too_Much_Nukie> @PeachSaliva Buy notebook, Paige will need it because she's bad.
[0:49:54] <$Damie904> it's so she doesnt use it
[0:49:55] <sirtommygunn> she's not gonna remember to use it against Asgore
[0:50:00] <+Drakenstorm13> i'd like to feel pat's head to know what it feels like, do you think it's smooth?
[0:50:03] <+CJett92> TEM TEM TIME
[0:50:04] <+Toblo1> Squeak
[0:50:04] <+Kaneis> They could pick the residue up again when they get to Temmie Village so it doesn't matter

[0:50:17] <Parapattern> @RafflesiaA I think they just send Muffet a telegram saying you supported them whether you save it or not. I think eating the doughnut triggers the telegram faster. I might be misremembering, though.

[1:01:49] <Stegersaurus> The important part is to backseat the backseaters
[1:01:49] <+Pavi132> *crazy talk activates* Temmie Village disappears
[1:01:51] <@TanktopNerd> calm down you nerds
[1:01:52] <Benpower236> Without the armor I think she'll never succeed.
[1:01:53] <mannimarco57> Pat saved our entertainment again!
[1:01:53] <+LogothX> Give em the stick
[1:01:53] <TheImmortal70> So I just realized that if the Temmies make the best armor, doesn't that mean they are the fucked up dwarves of this universe?
[1:01:54] <arcadeHemorrhage > It's not important
[1:01:55] <ArcanumMBD> @HyperCharge_Sam a blind playthrough with guidance making sure she sees all the secrets and shit is still a blind playthrough

[1:02:08] <Shazzlnet> Just give chat the controls. We'll get a perfect run
[1:02:11] <Louie_Salmon> I feel like Paige will actually die going back
[1:02:11] <RafflesiaA> @PeachSaliva Well since you're telling her to go back anyway have her get the dog residue, you can use them in battle as healing items
[1:02:13] <ToxInjection> I have a feeling Paige won't get much of a reaction from the LULSORANDUM aspect of Temmie.
[1:02:15] <%krawtch> shit like this is why your families talk about you in a hushed tone in the other room
[1:02:15] <+TechGamer> @cgmerryo Dose she? I thought she equiped it after she saved it

[1:09:56] <sirtommygunn> im imagining a blue stop sign
[1:10:05] <strickersdickers> man paige sucks huh
[1:10:10] <RafflesiaA> @HyperCharge_Sam Paige decided on her own not to kill anyone
[1:10:11] <Ell1ot> she's flexing instead of shoo again?
[1:10:12] <lethallunacyx> It's ok she'll forget in 10 mins
[1:10:14] <laguerrilha> They will sell of stream, its too tedious to do it live
[1:10:16] <Darren716> I cant wait for her to sell all the dog residue
[1:10:17] <Lazaruz95> @HyperCharge_Sam She's locked in on Neutral
[1:10:17] <Hawkbone_> OH MY GOD PAIGE
[1:10:18] <elementofloyalty> Why is he half horse and snake?
[1:10:23] <megamonmon123> @laguerrilha fair enough
[1:10:24] <MissMalisin> 💪 🐴
[1:10:26] <Cheapheatmo> that attack is fairly annoying
[1:10:27] <CactusChef3> because he's aaron
[1:10:27] <firmlygraspi1> sea horse
[1:10:30] <@corn_on_fire> paige please
[1:10:33] <@MelBrooksKA> This is gonna fuck Paige's recognition of stop signs while she drives I bet
[1:10:33] <%Dingalow> Paige would be great at WarioWare
[1:10:34] <Karhax> she is flexing again
[1:10:34] <RetributionP> she really needed to play with the dpad from the beginning
[1:10:35] <Enyoyable> to be fair, this game controls a lot worse with a stick than with WASD
[1:10:35] <Xeno351> she dodges into the bullets NotLikeThis
[1:10:38] <Tarkara> @elementofloyalty hes a seahorse
[1:10:39] <$PonyHearts> cheer100 Paige, you hate Your Name and Temmie, do you even have a soul or is that old joke about gingers true?
[1:10:41] <+maskedriderhero> @elementofloyalty Why not
[1:10:42] <Louie_Salmon> @HyperCharge_Sam
[1:10:42] <megamonmon123> she forgot to shoo and flex
[1:10:44] <HyperCharge_Sam> @Lazaruz95 I think she's still good?
[1:10:44] <DraxTD> by ego raptor
[1:10:45] <Parapattern> Even with the increased invincibility frames, she's barely getting by.
[1:10:45] <Agami23> funny thing, homestuck has a horse themed flexman aswell.
[1:10:47] <elementofloyalty> More like Merman
[1:10:52] <megamonmon123> honestly i think paige is too stressed
[1:10:56] <mr_slaide> This is painful.
[1:10:58] <SafetyBet> Leave Aaron alone BibleThump
[1:10:59] <ArcanumMBD> @HyperCharge_Sam I mean, I'd rather Pat guide Paige to a pacifist ending because if she were to get the neutral ending I doubt she'd want to replay it on or off stream to get pacifist too, and not getting pacifist is just missing content
[1:11:00] <SevenVileEyes> @elementofloyalty he's a seahorse get it?

[1:11:18] <Cheapheatmo> holy shti
[1:11:19] <Lazaruz95> @HyperCharge_Sam True Pacifist is impossible if it's your very first time playing the game. And Genocide went out the door the moment she left even one monster alive
[1:11:19] <firmlygraspi1> w-what
[1:11:21] <saikousuplex> lmao
[1:11:21] <sirtommygunn> pee pee doo do
[1:11:22] <Ssaik> WE can't know that
[1:11:23] <%Remery_> are you sure about that????
[1:11:27] <+Hilleltaco> @HyperCharge_Sam She already knew a few details, and Pat hasn't straight up told her to take any specific path. Pretty sure she started on that on her own due to already knowing about how you could not kill stuff
[1:11:30] <ArcanumMBD> @HyperCharge_Sam and like, neutral ending is just incomplete pacifist
[1:11:40] <%Freelance7> @Lazaruz95 I got True Pacifist my first time.
[1:11:40] <%Aitch971> @PeachSaliva Just run
[1:11:43] <Louie_Salmon> @yeeyeyee I mean, I'm not gonna straight-up lie to her
[1:11:43] <SafetyBet> Who told her those boots were good? Fashion police please Kappa

[1:11:59] <arcadeHemorrhage > Goblins D:<
[1:12:03] <Parapattern> Just run, Paige
[1:12:05] <onesleepymonkey> I just saw the final bone attack from Papyrus jump you did and went here to see the chat's reaction. nice to catch you live though.
[1:12:08] <@TanktopNerd> You can see Paiges brain stopping when she has to think about stopping for blue and dodging the white projectiles
[1:12:10] <ArcanumMBD> @PeachSaliva Reminder you can run away
[1:12:10] <@TanktopNerd> It just shuts down
[1:12:11] <@Moobot> Do you have a Fanfiction for Paige to read? Submit it to us here and it may get read on stream! http://bit.ly/2jsxJo9

[1:12:18] <@thenefftw> @PeachSaliva You can run away
[1:12:18] <@Moobot> YOU'RE BEING TOO LOUD! (HeeeeyYouGuuuuys) (warning)
[1:12:21] <%ZebraFace> Flee
[1:12:23] <+CJett92> Maybe dont get rid of the guy who heals you first
[1:12:24] <%krawtch> everyone knows boots are an accessory, so people think they suck when you pair them with sweatpants and a mcdonalds bag hat
[1:12:25] <Parapattern> It's the same projectile every time!
[1:12:26] <Louie_Salmon> @onesleepymonkey Chat indeed lost it, as they should
[1:12:27] <laguerrilha> When it gets too hard she keeps going to the right corner and stay there
[1:12:35] <Lazaruz95> @Freelance7 You can get it no problem if you play like True Pacifist, but you need to have gotten the Neutral ending first, iirc
[1:12:38] <megamonmon123> @PonyHearts one step forward, 3 steps back
[1:12:38] <salty_syd913> what
[1:12:39] <Valkyrjsen> Have you ever tried fleeing, Paige?
[1:12:40] <%alolanslowpoke> cheer100 Paige, try using the DPad to move
[1:12:41] <cizal11> it might take more than one go
[1:12:43] <Ell1ot> you tried it once
[1:12:45] <+LazyRabb1t> doesnt mean stop trying
[1:12:47] <vivecdidnothingwrong> Lies?
[1:12:47] <%ZebraFace> Try again
[1:12:49] <Parapattern> ??????
[1:12:49] <Hawkbone_> YOU TRIED IT ONCE
[1:12:51] <RafflesiaA> You mean that one time you tried to flee and then you fled????
[1:12:52] <Eresus> lies
[1:12:52] <Cheapheatmo> yeah it's a good idea she knows flee for the upcoming fight
[1:12:53] <%SpookySpaghooti> I think she did it once and succeeded
[1:12:55] <Hydrapissed> When has she?
[1:12:56] <Metballs> That's not how it works, Paige
[1:12:56] <CactusChef3> you tried it once
[1:12:57] <%yeeyeyee> every time paige tries to flee she does it in a fucking boss fight
[1:12:57] <Dektoide> @PeachSaliva can't flee the first encounter
[1:12:58] <jerf_herf> Lies
[1:12:58] <elementofloyalty> Peach is no coward

[1:27:38] <%yeeyeyee> undyne's dick is so hard
[1:27:39] <Parapattern> Both

[1:27:43] <ArcanumMBD> @PeachSaliva to be fair on paige a lot of people get stuck at this part
[1:27:43] <wizardofsouls> yes.
[1:27:44] <$PonyHearts> THIS IS HER EASIEST FORM
[1:27:45] <Zeemod155> Pat is trying so hard to not be a dick
[1:27:45] <anar_bael> I want to say both but yes also
[1:27:45] <$evermoore_hex> DarkSeidPaige
[1:27:46] <Twoiis> She's doing relatively fine at the arrows.

[1:27:51] <Dr_mr_wang> yes
[1:27:51] <firmlygraspi1> shes hard but its just reading comprehension
[1:27:52] <+blacklyon50> YES
[1:27:53] <Highwang> That's a "You're sleeping on the couch tonight Pat" question
[1:27:54] <GhostPyre> If you're green you can't escape, but what happens when you're not green anymore? Hrrrrrm. *Thinks hard.
[1:27:54] <+GreenBrains_> I died 3 or 4 times before figuring it out
[1:27:55] <megamonmon123> both
[1:27:57] <patismyhero> I am having lots of fun.
[1:27:58] <CorruptDropbear> To be fair, I killed Undyne first playthrough because I couldn't work it out
[1:27:58] <EuropantLamprey> BLOODBORNE
[1:28:00] <Delta56th> Then don't.
[1:28:00] <jayordanny> lol one hit won't kill UNDYNE
[1:28:01] <Firesparks> undyne can take at least one hit
[1:28:01] <%bluetocho13> Paige your giving me a panic attack its not hard
[1:28:02] <CactusChef3> tell her clicking fight once isnt going to ruin anything
[1:28:02] <arcadeHemorrhage > If you were better you wood not need healing items
[1:28:03] <+Chewygamer> YOu can't kill her in 1 hit
[1:28:05] <Shazzlnet> @PeachSaliva You can't kill bosses in one hit
[1:28:05] <+byeblackbird> You don't need to be afraid of that if you just pay attention
[1:28:05] <+Toynota10> PAIGE
[1:28:05] <CorruptDropbear> it is very counterintuitive
[1:28:06] <topendbuzz> eh you wont kill her in one hit
[1:28:08] <diggiefan1825> ahhh too many
[1:28:08] <firmlygraspi1> YEAH
[1:28:09] <Benpower236> Only missed one there
[1:28:10] <+Toblo1> It only counts if its a kill
[1:28:10] <grouchio> RUN
[1:28:12] <Schuhart> Just punching them once is fine
[1:28:13] <%sleepy_coffee> Pat you gotta do the Line! The game can be beaten by children
[1:28:14] <+Camail> clicking fight once isnt bad, you can choose to miss an attack PeachSaliva
[1:28:14] <+Undenizen> To be fair, Undyne is not easy
[1:28:14] <firmlygraspi1> NO
[1:28:15] <cizal11> LMFAO
[1:28:15] <+Nefarious_Bear> NOOOO
[1:28:15] <+Hilleltaco> Fortunately it doesn't seem super easy to actually accidentally attack, considering the multiple parts to that

[2:15:22] <Sochin_Iitsu> Bicicles are honestly the best healing items for a pacifist run
[2:15:25] <+Dingus_Tickler> Problem with WoW is that it’s a huge time sink that requires dedication that Pat really shouldn’t dedicate his time to. Considering all the stuff he already does

[2:16:24] <@thenefftw> I was about to say that
[2:16:25] <grenadier42> C# is basically Java if Java wasn't a giant piece of shit
[2:16:25] <laguerrilha> Yep was going to say that
[2:16:29] <reonome> put laxatives in them
[2:16:30] <TurtlesAndTentacles> Ha Ha Ha! Good One pat

[2:16:39] <%TenaciousLeeOfficial> No what you do is you find that guy and fuck his mom
[2:16:40] <Laughingrouge> Trying not to shit your on stream, it fills you with determination.
[2:16:40] <+brentoland> Put poison in it and only you have the antidote
[2:16:42] <FrustratedAF> PUT A RAZOR BLADE IN THE SANDWICH
[2:16:43] <$PonyHearts> Just do what I did, buy a big scary looking bear trap!
[2:16:43] <Grayhammatter> laxatives SeemsGood
[2:16:46] <@corn_on_fire> only one?
[2:16:49] <+TeethMuncher> Gambling
[2:16:50] <@corn_on_fire> the odds are too low
[2:16:51] <elementofloyalty> Stop putting meal in fridge
[2:16:52] <RafflesiaA> Just make one of them super spicy
[2:16:52] <Dektoide> Lax all the sandwiches
[2:16:52] <MellowYellowFellow> "you know what i mean"
[2:16:52] <Iam_Dead> One of these sandwhiches has a gun in it
[2:16:53] <+KanjiBestHusbando> The bois <3
[2:16:53] <+Dingus_Tickler> Spit on your food like how Paige spits on babies
[2:16:56] <+damnitmcgarnicle> just put an unwrapped condom in a sandwich.
[2:16:56] <+nepwar> but what if they put laxative in your food to spite you
[2:16:57] <megamonmon123> @FrustratedAF you have ISSUES
[2:16:57] <%Solidnick18> what
[2:16:57] <EASrake> I think that counts as poisoning
[2:17:04] <TheNeedlesD> Get two sandwiches, put laxatives in both, say only one has it on a post-it note
[2:17:07] <%swordsman70> You better finish that thought Pat
[2:17:07] <MainMan_Jonadiah> @megamonmon123 "How do I get out of the ruins?" "Bitch, why you wanna leave? Am I not cool enough?"
[2:17:07] <+President_Miyazaki> Its legal to put laxatives in your own food.
[2:17:09] <Yuroshi> do that, but use rat poison
[2:17:10] <DXLelouch24> Alphys time
[2:17:10] <+SkaNinja> i think it's legal if you just do without telling anyone
[2:17:11] <InsomniacPersona> they could take the laxative out if you write that down
[2:17:11] <sparkboy777> TIME FOR BEST GIRL
[2:17:12] <FrustratedAF> put a note on it that says "i don't wash my hands after using the bathroom"
[2:17:12] <grandmonkbun> They are eating your property
