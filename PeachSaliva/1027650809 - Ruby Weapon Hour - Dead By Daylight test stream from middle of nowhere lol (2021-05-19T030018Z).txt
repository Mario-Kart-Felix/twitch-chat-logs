[0:35:08] <RatherUninteresting> but I thought that's cus it...you know fuckin RAINED
[0:35:09] <FujoshiCadet> i think it's more associated with coming out in a humid summer
[0:35:10] <+Taisuru> Co-Up
[0:35:11] <@SoFarFetched> go do some coop
[0:35:11] <%RedPanda25> I've dealt with lovebug infestations

[0:36:00] <RatherUninteresting> @redpanda25 same they tried to use them as pesticide control and my whole town was overrun
[0:36:06] <%Ranryu692> @deathygz burned weed, in my experience LUL
[0:36:18] <DickieWoodsmall_279> @deathygz if you get enough they have kind of a bland musty smell but it's not particularly offensive
[0:36:20] <@SoFarFetched> yeah demogorgon got a bit of a buff and that noise was him teleporting.
[0:36:20] <deathygz> cant believe the roaches are blazing too
[0:36:28] <weapon000> isn't that the stranger things monster?
[0:36:30] <emper0rner0> Demogorgon just got buffed so more people are playing him

[0:45:20] <%Keyd00d> It's a bit muffled but it's all good
[0:45:22] <udurbalanced> I like it
[0:45:22] <silver_stout> its radio but its not terrible
[0:45:23] <Faustgesicht> Little bit of radio
[0:45:23] <+OfficioPrefectusCorgi> 1600
[0:45:23] <Dakuu75> on a scale of 1-10. I give it a 4.5
[0:45:23] <%nyxing_it_up> killer downed me, dropped me on gnome, then let me escape. I appreciated them a lot lol
[0:45:24] <%MarylandJutsu> its not too bad, but its not great
[0:45:24] <%blutzwavedave> Not amazing, but it's fine
[0:45:24] <TheFramedWarlock> It's not great
[0:45:25] <+AnarchyAside> It's fine, but a bit robotic
[0:45:27] <%JimmyRuss> I can tolerate it, it's fine for a temp setup
[0:45:27] <$shurtal> it's fine
[0:45:28] <RatherUninteresting> it's meh
[0:45:28] <akarchives> I thought that you doing a bit honestly
[0:45:29] <+sandrews> it's fine more like 1950s
[0:45:31] <Sotetsu> It sounds like I'm in a zoom meeting
[0:45:31] <%nyxing_it_up> kinda radio but its fine
[0:45:38] <TheZearGuy> It’s fine more or less

[0:45:44] <Nekros4442> It's fine Peach, it's a temp setup dont worry about it
[0:45:45] <Arancet> its like a decent headset, but bad for normal streamer quality
[0:45:45] <$NitronStreams> its bad but not unbearable
[0:45:45] <+Anime_Flux> it's like you're talking through a pile of laundry, but it's fine
[0:45:46] <zeekayart> like we're really out there it's cool it's fine
[0:45:47] <FujoshiCadet> it's fine

[0:47:36] <Faustgesicht> Yo Peach, what's your Favorite DBD Menu music?
[0:47:39] <%ShockzNDrawe> I asked you do and you did in a drunken stupor
[0:47:40] <%Lunarhawk> The real question is ARE THEY a stanky loser?
[0:47:41] <%Promessa_EX> Promessa_EX subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 15 months! peach stream, stocks are up m64StocksUp m64StocksUp m64StocksUp
[0:47:51] <akarchives> People are predicting RE2/RE3 content based on the rain in the teaser, but that's a *stretch*
[0:47:55] <VentWilsn> watch the RE character be the tyrant from code veronica
[0:48:03] <%lord_of_iron_kingdom> So Peach, what is your favorite Character in dbd?
[0:48:04] <Faustgesicht> Just in general
[0:48:08] <mromnisight> Peeach Hey
[0:48:10] <sleepofgiants> Peaches, i was just diagnosed with bell's palsy and had to order an anime eyepatch because my eye wont close. Health problem solidarity thesph1MistyKiss
[0:48:12] <+ironbologna> Paige's favorite menu music is whatever they play at Mcdonalds

[0:48:18] <RaidenRising> mr x and leon / claire

[0:48:43] <%king_wragles> and 2 days later Mechwarrior5
[0:48:44] <Clundy> I wonder if Konami would just release console ports of the pachinko games for the west and sell it as a remake of older titles mikeliveFacepalm
[0:48:47] <%king_wragles> Good week for me
[0:48:47] <weapon000> I would be surprised if it's not Nemesis, Jill, and Chris
[0:48:48] <akarchives> @Ranryu692 Chris coming to find a Survivor to propagate THE BLOODLINE
[0:48:51] <%RedPanda25> doesnt he have a pizza man costume
[0:48:57] <mromnisight> Myers
[0:49:03] <%Ranryu692> @Ranryu692 exactly!
[0:49:04] <%king_wragles> Oh hey, did you use the code SoFar sent you @PeachSaliva ?
[0:49:04] <@SoFarFetched> freddy got nerfed LUL cause he was too strong
[0:49:11] <TheZearGuy> Not a fan of the updated look of the dbd models. The faces look off, if that makes sense.
[0:49:15] <RaidenRising> chris is the killer and leon / ada are the survivors
[0:49:17] <%lord_of_iron_kingdom> honestly, Bill looks great in this game
[0:49:43] <$AzureGale> Awwwwwww
[0:49:49] <Skatedeandre> LUL
[0:49:49] <tanarath> Paige!
[0:49:49] <%Promessa_EX> that's a reasonable reaction
[0:49:55] <+Lunarhawk> Now if you got an eyepatch people would think a leprechaun hit you
[0:49:57] <%lord_of_iron_kingdom> That is funny as fuck
[0:49:58] <+Taisuru> And that's how Paige became Blind
[0:50:01] <lildaddybree99> i know that young teen heart feel
[0:50:07] <zeekayart> it's all in the eyepatch
[0:50:07] <%Keyd00d> Eyepatches are cool
[0:50:11] <%Lichelet> Lichelet subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 2 months! love you peach you're really cool ok
[0:50:11] <Sain_127> aaargh matey R)
[0:50:14] <%Idziman> you should have gone for two eyepatches
[0:50:18] <sleepofgiants> I'm excited for it ngl
[0:50:18] <FujoshiCadet> get two
[0:50:19] <Sotetsu> Is that why you like Undine?
[0:50:21] <%Idziman> that would have sealed the deal
[0:50:23] <+D00msDayDan> it's a wonder guessing your prescription didn't result in wearing two eyepatches
[0:50:27] <weapon000> like Molotovo Cocktease
[0:50:27] <Piemono> Two eyepatches and a peg leg
[0:50:30] <%ShockzNDrawe> well you don't wear glasses so you might as well be walking around with 2 eyepathces
[0:50:31] <+Higure_yoru> and that boys name was Albert Einstein
[0:50:32] <+ironbologna> That poor woman just wanted an eye
[0:50:37] <%Promessa_EX> +2 Drama -1 Perception
[0:50:37] <@Jekado> why doesn't super eyepatch wolf wear an eyepatch?
[0:50:44] <akarchives> alright so here's the question: eyepatch and monocle does it work
[0:50:45] <Sain_127> still accurate to this day R)
[0:50:50] <akarchives> (I ask this as a glasses wearer)
[0:50:56] <venny_doe> Pats gout is a bit of a turn on, ngl

[0:51:03] <+SenorCounter> Get scurvy and a peg leg, 2 up her.
[0:51:06] <lildaddybree99> one of my friends currently has a crush on a mutual friend with a glass eye and she know jist knows random glass eye facts
[0:51:07] <$rdark_ksu> does she still have the eye patch?
[0:51:10] <sleepofgiants> How is the eyepatch doing these days
[0:51:11] <tanarath> Paige, are you going to cosplay Lady D with Pat?
[0:51:11] <FujoshiCadet> you dont need more vision disabilities

[0:51:17] <@SoFarFetched> geefPoint *
[0:51:19] <BackflipCharm> Eyepatch and monocle over the same eye
[0:51:23] <Skatedeandre> GOUT
[0:51:25] <%lord_of_iron_kingdom> Pat has to be Hisesburg
[0:51:36] <scht3v3> Pat as the doll
[0:51:43] <venny_doe> Now i feel bad. I love pat.
[0:51:45] <@SoFarFetched> HES GETTING OOOLLLLLD
[0:51:53] <lildaddybree99> @backflipcharm eyepatch monocle and glass eye all at once
[0:51:56] <Sain_127> and his anger aura
[0:52:01] <weapon000> You see the RE 8 puppet stuff?
[0:52:03] <akarchives> @SoFarFetched DON'T LET IT SET IN
[0:52:05] <BackflipCharm> I like the way you think
[0:52:05] <+AnarchyAside> Get Pat an eye patch Paige
[0:52:08] <@PlagueOfGripes> we are all suffering
[0:52:10] <zeekayart> you know they always have eyepatches - where's the nosepatch?
[0:52:13] <%Lunarhawk> Did he get Gout just so he could compare it to your Lupus
[0:52:15] <Maids4lyfe> pat really has gout?

[0:54:01] <@SoFarFetched> Are they going Adept Plague? geefThink
[0:54:06] <%lord_of_iron_kingdom> random screaming?
[0:54:09] <%Promessa_EX> lol is that an ability that just makes you scream uncontrollably?
[0:54:10] <zeekayart> why does the character have to scream like that BibleThump BibleThump
[0:54:17] <@SoFarFetched> @Lunarhawk Infectious Fright Perk where people near a downed survivor within a radius scream
[0:54:24] <%king_wragles> Dollars to donuts @SoFarFetched , they just don't have other perks at low rank
[0:54:29] <@PlagueOfGripes> that's how my plague is set up too. disable gens with double terror radius
[0:54:38] <@SoFarFetched> @king_wragles look even in low rank might as well do adept
[0:54:51] <%king_wragles> Y'know, fair
[0:54:54] <@SoFarFetched> But yeah she's got Infectious Fright Paige,that makes you scream if you're near a survivor when they get downed.

[0:57:53] <dan_g_v> it's a party in here!
[0:57:57] <$Doctor_Death_Bed> dang, just when i was going to bed
[0:58:00] <doc_ock_rokc> TWO STREAMS
[0:58:01] <@PlagueOfGripes> ranks reset recently. she's at 18
[0:58:03] <doc_ock_rokc> INA ROW
[0:58:04] <$Doctor_Death_Bed> i hate that i keep missing these
[0:58:12] <Laecerelius> Amazing!
[0:58:21] <%Lunarhawk> Just give up
[0:58:23] <+dkhighwind> Victory to the Poopy Lady!
[0:58:24] <%Bane_Kaikyo> IT'S A SKILL CHECK NOW???..... instead of a MASH!?!?
[0:58:25] <%rumtumtugnutz> you guys are fucked
[0:58:27] <PartyFavors> Man, I looked away for a moment after you got hooked in the basement, and when I looked back, you were getting hooked AGAIN in the basement
[0:58:28] <+Odasann> They might be waiting for hatch
[0:58:29] <mikeriffic> but was your best enough?
[0:58:30] <dan_g_v> just give up, it always works
[0:58:31] <PlaidisTheNewPlaid> Two streams in a row!? You spoil us
[0:58:31] <@SoFarFetched> @PlagueOfGripes it  feels theres a lot more low ranks than usual recently. There's been some matches that were questionable for me as killer.
[0:58:41] <nowhere1976> hatch has not spawned yet
[0:58:45] <@SoFarFetched> I assume b ecause RE DLC coming soon or anniversary
[0:58:45] <akarchives> and this is why Claudette's deserve *no* respect
[0:58:48] <+DefNotMac> atallbGarrStare
[0:58:51] <weapon000> take me crab father
[0:58:55] <PlaidisTheNewPlaid> Murder she wrote
[0:59:00] <nowhere1976> she waiting for you to die
[0:59:00] <%king_wragles> @Bane_Kaikyo ya, one of the devs did a big no no so they had to actually listen to people begging for disability QOL
[0:59:08] <@SoFarFetched> yeah claudettes probably gonna try to find that hatch now
[0:59:23] <%Promessa_EX> claudette from the room?
[0:59:26] <@PlagueOfGripes> back when the game made blendettes hilarious
[0:59:28] <+Odasann> @sofarfetched it’s because they broke the rank reset i think, some people got reset and other people stayed the same rank but are matching with lower ranks
[0:59:29] <+MayorRev> Hi paige! how're you?
[0:59:41] <lildaddybree99> goodnight. got my second to last chemical engineering final tomorrow before graduation. wish me luck
[0:59:42] <%Lunarhawk> More time to chat
[0:59:47] <$cactus_gato> I think the plague easily has the best design in the game
[0:59:51] <%Promessa_EX> m64StocksUp m64StocksUp m64StocksUp
[1:00:00] <emper0rner0> The last rank reset was bugged and it reset some red ranks all the way back to 20
[1:00:05] <+dkhighwind> Good luck, lildaddy!
[1:00:05] <$AzureGale> Paige has WHAT
[1:00:09] <dan_g_v> mean the Peach retroactively wins
[1:00:10] <akarchives> @emper0rner0 RANKROULETTE BABYYYYYYY
[1:00:13] <+dkhighwind> You got that final!
[1:00:19] <@SoFarFetched> @Odasann well I mean more of people not knowing DbD gameplay. cause I got a 4k with a Tier1 Myers by just M1ing. Especially since during that match they weren't running just walking or doing gens.
[1:00:30] <feelmyfunk> never had much love for this game but watching you play is a lot of fun . love how much you love the game
[1:00:30] <%Promessa_EX> nah just do it. SUperstar Paige
[1:00:32] <dan_g_v> we deserve special treatment
[1:00:34] <%Bane_Kaikyo> @king_wragles wait, is mashing space a thing disabled people can struggle with?
[1:00:40] <FujoshiCadet> own it
[1:00:43] <Sain_127> i think you are a huge nerd to this day
[1:00:50] <$Agami23> every time i watch you play this it makes me want to play this
[1:00:54] <PlaidisTheNewPlaid> Make sure to jump up on a desk and rip your shirt when you flex on them
[1:00:56] <@SoFarFetched> @Bane_Kaikyo people have  destroyed keyboards from mashing space or their fingers/wrists from mashing
[1:00:57] <+atwitchical> That's confidence! That's a good thing
[1:01:11] <@SoFarFetched> People tend to rebind it to another thing
[1:01:19] <%Bane_Kaikyo> I see
[1:01:29] <@Jekado> it replaced the old system tho
[1:01:33] <mikeriffic> but Paige, do you enjoy the Murder....in DBD of course?
[1:01:35] <Sain_127> its a really good game, lots of variety and ways to play
[1:01:36] <@Jekado> its how struggling on hook works now
[1:01:41] <%maskofmichael> paige, why do?
[1:01:45] <PlaidisTheNewPlaid> Paige likes it when you chase her with a spooky ghost axe
[1:01:48] <@SoFarFetched> Like especially with Paige's hands/wrists where hers get destroyed from mashing or holding buttons.
[1:01:49] <%king_wragles> @king_wragles Joint problems, carpal tunnel, things of that nature
[1:01:50] <akarchives> I can only play so matches in a row because I literally tense my whole body up playing Killer
[1:01:54] <@PlagueOfGripes> I don't know, you get pretty salty sometimes. like when the killer likes me and hates you
[1:01:59] <+ironbologna> "brute smarts"
[1:02:01] <dan_g_v> she's been known to dab in the kill
[1:02:02] <FujoshiCadet> spooky horror is fun
[1:02:23] <nowhere1976> killer is stressful as some that is rank 4 it can be rough
[1:02:28] <%maskofmichael> yeah, paige gets to kill all the women

[1:03:31] <akarchives> @PlagueOfGripes nah it only takes one to break up
[1:03:32] <$Agami23> i would lose my mind if you and pat played "we were here"
[1:03:35] <%RedPanda25> Do the shopping cart
[1:03:41] <%RedPanda25> or the Bus Driver

[1:04:17] <fairore> @Anime_Flux what did will do you to you
[1:04:29] <SaltyDongs> I get you Paige
[1:04:31] <TurtlesAndTentacles> Is it cause of your Lady boner?
[1:04:33] <RatherUninteresting> boo gross lame
[1:04:33] <+DamnFineCupofStreaming> Hi paige
[1:04:36] <@Jekado> i'm seen you on Meowri's streams sometimes
[1:04:45] <+MisterTylerrr> She's pretty hot. ngl
[1:04:50] <SaltyDongs> yeah "funny" sure
[1:05:02] <TurtlesAndTentacles> No her clout. Doing a damn hot tub stream. come on
[1:05:07] <@SoFarFetched> I always try to tell paige when Jenna is streaming
[1:05:12] <+Sendrak70> Its a shame she got demonetized without notification.
[1:05:15] <+GalacticaPhanto> Jenna is mad funny
[1:05:18] <%ClericOfSparda> Jenna is good
[1:05:19] <udurbalanced> Amouranth?
[1:05:23] <TheZearGuy> Smacks a barrel
[1:05:27] <Puhff> LISTEN
[1:05:28] <$Agami23> i need to catch up on meowri's D&D campaign
[1:05:28] <$hrbeck_> Did Paige see that Veibae watched Plague’s pokemon video?
[1:05:29] <@SoFarFetched> THATS A GOOD BARREL
[1:05:35] <+Odasann> Ye jennas always pretty cool
[1:05:38] <+Saggitori> she is smart, knows how to make cash money
[1:05:42] <RatherUninteresting> I mean you have to be smart to make money like that
[1:05:47] <TurtlesAndTentacles> Yes smart for milking her beauty. Paige's lady boner on full display
[1:05:56] <@Jekado> @Agami23 "End Turn"
[1:05:58] <@SoFarFetched> be nice to other streamers
[1:06:01] <+axenred> herro peach!
[1:06:02] <VentWilsn> wtf is the deal with those hot tub streams anyway?
[1:06:14] <mythrilcrafter> I love that all my favorite streamers like each other's streams!
[1:06:19] <s1rcuit> @PeachSaliva I think she ended just after your first set of lines
[1:06:23] <RatherUninteresting> @ventwilsn trash for horny boys?
[1:06:27] <distorted_utopia> InuyoFace
[1:06:45] <%ClericOfSparda> I personally don't like Amouranth, but it's awesome that you enjoy her
[1:06:46] <+MisterTylerrr> I do enjoy the occasional Amouranth tweet
[1:06:49] <dan_g_v> yeh, Eevee was a bit too much
[1:06:53] <+Sendrak70> I dont feel like her content is appropriate for Twitch. But shes made her money.
[1:06:55] <VentWilsn> @ratheruninteresting alright got it thanks man
[1:06:57] <Puhff> @PeachSaliva how do you feel about hot tub streams over all? I'm fine with them but just not sure if Twitch is the place for explicitly adult streams like that.
[1:07:02] <mikeriffic> is that the one who got Whiteclaw in her eye?
[1:07:18] <TurtlesAndTentacles> mhm
[1:07:18] <+MayorRev> heard of minx! she sounds charming
[1:07:20] <+goose_attack_almanac> I think they were saying Veibae couldn't handle the raw power of Plague
[1:07:24] <dan_g_v> Peach should do a bath tub stream where she washes Pat's head with help from Emlo and Gief
[1:07:25] <$Agami23> veibae stopped watching the pokemon thing right before "no, i mean groom me into your top pick!"
[1:07:26] <+Anime_Flux> wait what?
[1:07:30] <+MayorRev> she's the "HE'S ONTO ANOTHER FOOKIN BANANA" girl yea?
[1:07:38] <mikeriffic> saw her through a youtube twitch clip thing "Watch me stab my whiteclaw"
[1:07:42] <mythrilcrafter> You know who's also super hot and funny, Pat from Castle Super Beast. I'd like to see a hot tub stream of him!
[1:07:48] <udurbalanced> We're on our way to Rekieta hot tub streams
[1:07:48] <$hrbeck_> Veibae tapped out when you said cocksleeve
[1:07:50] <+MisterTylerrr> Are babies still whining about hottub streams?
[1:07:50] <%optimasmaximas> jesus
[1:07:58] <+Sendrak70> Twitch did just demonetize her because of her content. So I guess twitch has spoken.
[1:08:01] <dan_g_v> Pat would just float in the bath tub
[1:08:05] <%ShockzNDrawe> can't be a cam girl if you never use a camera
[1:08:07] <%ShockzNDrawe> gottem
[1:08:08] <%ospreyworks> People need to stop slut shaming and mind their damn business
[1:08:10] <fairore> @mythrilcrafter lol
[1:08:14] <%Lichelet> I'm worried that someone underage is gonna try y'know???
[1:08:17] <dan_g_v> he needs to lay sexily halfway into the water
[1:08:28] <Puhff> well Twitch is fine with making money so they'll just do whatever makes the most of it
[1:08:37] <%ospreyworks> Maybe parents should be more aware of what their kids are watching and doing
[1:08:45] <%ospreyworks> Stop letting the computer babysit
[1:08:48] <+GalacticaPhanto> When are we getting Thot Ghost face?
[1:08:56] <%Ranryu692> mainstream
[1:08:58] <udurbalanced> Peach streams are obscene in a different, much better way
[1:09:03] <Valdorick> "So you're role playing a frumpy lowclass striper"
[1:09:04] <mikeriffic> I mean you do have those boots @PeachSaliva
[1:09:04] <+GalacticaPhanto> I need Ghostface to show some leggy dammit
[1:09:12] <dan_g_v> @Lichelet yeah, that is my worry too. A kid trying to imitate one of the streamers they like and doing something that looks bad
[1:09:16] <s1rcuit> nah, she's already decided what she thinks
[1:09:20] <+Sendrak70> @Puhff They just turned off ad revenue for Amaranth. I expect a change to ToS, or at least similar treatment for people who similar content.
[1:09:21] <Puhff> @ospreyworks parents can't montior what theyir children watch 24/7 and idk if Twitch has parental controls
[1:09:22] <+axenred> PLEASE STOP SWEARING
[1:09:30] <+Gespens> My mom was really weirded out to learn that my cousin streams and makes a lot of good money off of it
[1:09:32] <%ShockzNDrawe> Paige having a mental break down over Baba for 3 hours ASMR
[1:09:33] <fairore> @GalacticaPhanto the rapper ?
[1:09:36] <+MisterTylerrr> The concept of, "if you don't like, don't watch" is totally lost on this generation, and it's so stupid
[1:09:37] <%Promessa_EX> lol you're not really obscene once we get past the Tits and Shit balls
[1:09:37] <+GinAndRoses> "ball in my ass, what's that?"
[1:09:38] <+MayorRev> ahahahaha
[1:09:46] <+Anime_Flux> "What's an orb?"
[1:09:46] <mythrilcrafter> I'm here for shadow puzzles, mcdonalds, and brute smarts
[1:09:47] <%ospreyworks> Parents can also restrict internet access
[1:09:48] <udurbalanced> The kids already know what titballs are, to be fair
[1:09:52] <Awkward_Internet_User> Never change Paige
[1:09:54] <@SoFarFetched> Youre not supposed to be underage and have an account on twitch anyway,they banned a couple people I think
[1:10:01] <+MayorRev> kids probly shouldnt know about "balls in my ass"
[1:10:03] <PartyFavors> Oh someone finally got hit
[1:10:07] <+BettyMwwaahh> No cursing mopSleep
[1:10:09] <$rdark_ksu> Sonic High School (clean version)
[1:10:09] <ergulor> and you cannot stop chat
[1:10:11] <TurtlesAndTentacles> In the words of Michael Jordan - F Them Kids
[1:10:11] <+NWR_James> @PeachSaliva you owe us more makeup...ON PAT. Bring out those eyes
[1:10:14] <+GalacticaPhanto> @fairore Yo if they replaced Ghostface the killer in this game with Ghostface Killah that'd be dope
[1:10:17] <mikeriffic> Why DO you say Balls in my ass? No one I know swears like you @PeachSaliva
[1:10:33] <+indigo_xoxo> That’s where they go
[1:10:33] <$hrbeck_> Balls in the ass should saved gor marriage
[1:10:35] <dan_g_v> @SoFarFetched didn't know that
[1:10:38] <%Promessa_EX> sonics strange groin issue
[1:10:38] <+MayorRev> I think her brain just panics and strings words together
[1:10:51] <fairore> @GalacticaPhanto i would die
[1:10:52] <dan_g_v> so, this killer is very chill with the Paige, huh
[1:10:52] <%Lichelet> @SoFarFetched Twitch's age is 13
[1:10:54] <Puhff> @Sendrak70 oic. Yeah, I don't think they should have their revenue taken away. Maybe just have an adults only section. But that's harder to do than just changing the ToS
[1:10:58] <udurbalanced> Play Bayonetta with Pat and make him do the sexy librarian look?  I'd watch
[1:10:59] <VentWilsn> just make him do it for the wedding, he literally cant say no
[1:11:00] <mikeriffic> Its a novelty
[1:11:01] <+DragonTrainerBen> ... or the parents could grow a pair and let kids hear things from strangers they 95% chance definitely say around the house anyway.
[1:11:04] <%ospreyworks> But also, let's be honest. At some point, kids find shit they aren't supposed to. Fanfic was my intro to R rated content, and you know what, that's not the worst way I could have learned about sex.
[1:11:04] <%optimasmaximas> ive always said "tits in my ass"
[1:11:05] <+Anime_Flux> lmao
[1:11:06] <+axenred> my virgin ears!
[1:11:09] <+MayorRev> I think its cause pat had a tantrum live on stream when you told him "everyone wins"
[1:11:12] <$Kharinite> oh my ears
[1:11:17] <+MayorRev> and just elected to forget about it
[1:11:19] <mikeriffic> Shit fuck is a fun one
[1:11:19] <+BettyMwwaahh> Kenny (unroolie) has a similar way of cursing
[1:11:21] <dan_g_v> somebody make a note for a twitch compilation for Twitch jumpscares
[1:11:21] <%ShockzNDrawe> scream "aw bob saget"
[1:11:23] <+MayorRev> AHAHAHA god u spooked me!
[1:11:25] <%maskofmichael> my ears paige
[1:11:28] <MyNameIsRasus> I'm deaf now
[1:11:29] <fairore> @udurbalanced too hard on her hands bro'
[1:11:29] <+MayorRev> D:
[1:11:32] <@PlagueOfGripes> paige why would you just stand there in the open
[1:11:35] <%Promessa_EX> prayer11SisterAbi maybe you can be a Christian vtuber some day prayer11SisterAbi
[1:11:35] <+GalacticaPhanto> Who is that?
[1:11:35] <s1rcuit> @PeachSaliva don't worry too much about it, I know a streamer girl that when she gets surprised she shouts "SHIT ON MY FACE"
[1:11:40] <$hrbeck_> Tiddie
[1:11:46] <emper0rner0> "Mommy what are tiddies?
[1:11:48] <+GalacticaPhanto> Is that Hag?
[1:11:48] <VentWilsn> gg bois, too many balls in ass cavity
[1:11:50] <%ShockzNDrawe> look a gnome
[1:11:54] <PartyFavors> Gnome!
[1:11:57] <udurbalanced> @fairore hasn't she played Dark Souls?  I feel like that's harder
[1:12:02] <%ShockzNDrawe> it's Pat
[1:12:02] <%ospreyworks> And parents have to take responsibility in controlling what their kids see. Twitch has TOS and if people are abiding by that, tough titties.
[1:12:04] <+AnarchyAside> Gnome!
[1:12:04] <+MayorRev> HOOH
[1:12:10] <+MayorRev> Paige i think you just got gnomed
[1:12:14] <$hrbeck_> Gnomed
[1:12:16] <@Jekado> Gnome is only found during end game colapse
[1:12:19] <+Anime_Flux> wow, this match went tits-up pretty quick
[1:12:23] <+AnarchyAside> Free Paige, get gnome!
[1:12:27] <@Jekado> that Gnome is the cosmetic
[1:12:33] <+ThatGuyfromMars> @ShockzNDrawe nah man, that's pat's dad
[1:12:34] <Puhff> rip
[1:12:40] <+Saggitori> gnome chompski
[1:12:48] <Archangel317> you've already got a gnome, you've got Pat!
[1:12:48] <@Jekado> The Gnome will just be out in the open and you have to kick it over or something as survivors
[1:12:49] <dan_g_v> remember, duck in the open and everything will be a-ok
[1:12:55] <%ospreyworks> Aside from hot tub streamers, there are streams of M rated games and I don't hear many people crying, "BUT THE CHILDREN" over that.
[1:12:56] <+Sendrak70> Just destroy every totem you see
[1:13:04] <fairore> @udurbalanced yeah she has beating 1 ,2 and bloodborne
[1:13:31] <dan_g_v> I thought that was a goblin
[1:13:49] <+Odasann> i can’t wait for the RE chapter, the speculation has been wild
[1:13:54] <lazydwight> you're blind due to an hex
[1:13:55] <+NaxipTV> yo
[1:14:02] <%ospreyworks> It's gonna be Lady D, isn't it.
[1:14:04] <+Anime_Flux> You go that way, I'll go home
[1:14:07] <udurbalanced> I kinda want a Bayonetta stream now. I don't have a Nintendo console to play 2.
[1:14:11] <$hrbeck_> Gib mor big lady
[1:14:15] <@Jekado> yes... the hex is why she is blind...
[1:14:24] <+Sendrak70> Gnome man is still stuck in the frozen north. Soon Paige will make her trek back north of the wall to save her hubby from the walkers.
[1:14:26] <+GalacticaPhanto> I bet it'll be Heisenberg with the hammer as the Resident Evil rep
[1:14:40] <Puhff> uh huh....the hex.....riiiiiight
[1:14:46] <+Odasann> Recent interview said the words iconic characters so they might be doing like re 1-3 characters
[1:14:47] <@Jekado> hmmm
[1:14:55] <+Anime_Flux> wow, good friggin luck
[1:14:59] <+GalacticaPhanto> BLIND
[1:15:08] <fairore> i just want to see pat give subnatica another try thats all i want
[1:15:08] <+Odasann> And they have lots of possibilities with legendary skins and all
[1:15:20] <+Anime_Flux> denied
[1:15:22] <+Saggitori> @peachsaliva how were your jabs
[1:15:23] <@Jekado> damn
[1:15:25] <Puhff> Paige they keep finding you cuz of ur dummy thicc ass cheeks and their loud clapping
[1:15:30] <%Ranryu692> Ranryu692 subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 20 months! This is apropos of nothing, but you know what movie is criminally under-appreciated? Megamind. That movie is incredible
[1:15:30] <%ospreyworks> I mean, Lady D is pretty iconic for only having been on the scene a few months.
[1:15:33] <+indigo_xoxo> Wow, hag turned it out
[1:15:37] <+GalacticaPhanto> This is another reason I can't do survivor, I'd leave them all to die
[1:16:01] <fairore> i wasnt paying attention  wtf is that
[1:16:02] <the_super_suit> poopy but and also balls
[1:16:11] <+Odasann> Not a lot of people have said this but i think Hunk would be a pretty cool survivor
[1:16:18] <%ShockzNDrawe> it's already been clipped
[1:16:18] <dan_g_v> much sush
[1:16:20] <$hrbeck_> My kiity is sleeping by my feet
[1:16:26] <lazydwight> you tried <\
[1:16:31] <Puhff> i just told my mom and she laughed
[1:16:31] <lazydwight> <3
[1:16:33] <Puhff> git rekt
[1:16:34] <spookyspider393> hellow wanna hear a joke if its not funny you can ban me I'll live with the consequences
[1:16:34] <%Promessa_EX> it's better than the 700 that know about that other thing
[1:16:42] <%maskofmichael> you did your best
[1:17:08] <+Odasann> The umbrella guy from RE that only wears a gas mask
[1:17:15] <Spydurman> got my 2nd shot last night. Been asleep all day and now doing ok with just lower back pain and a headache
[1:17:17] <Spydurman> oof
[1:17:31] <+Anime_Flux> yikes
[1:17:33] <s1rcuit> didn't know sore throat was a symptom, was worried I was getting food poisoning
[1:17:33] <fairore> @Odasann  you mean hunk
[1:17:34] <%ospreyworks> Oh, you know what would be a swerve, but could make for a cool killer? Verdugo or Regenerator
[1:17:36] <Spydurman> man, it sent you all over the place
[1:17:44] <+MooseIsGoose> I am getting my 2nd shot Friday
[1:17:45] <$hrbeck_> Every joint in my body hurt
[1:17:58] <mythrilcrafter> I was very tired and achey and felt generally unwell the day after. A couple tylonel and a good nap was a big help though
[1:18:00] <%Promessa_EX> i'm excited to get 2nd on the 27th and see if i can own it
[1:18:07] <+Odasann> @fairore ye i think he would be a cool survivor
[1:18:07] <RatherUninteresting> I need more blankets and less blankets!
[1:18:16] <+MooseIsGoose> I have to get it on my lunch break
[1:18:20] <%ShockzNDrawe> i got my first one last saturday
[1:18:21] <%Promessa_EX> the rest of my family had no reactions
[1:18:27] <UnImprest> I get mine Monday:)
[1:18:34] <floralkami> i have a feeling everyone who had a bad reaction to the shots would've had the most severe reactions if they would've contracted the actual virus
[1:18:34] <+atwitchical> I slept for basically 3 days straight
[1:18:35] <$GarbageNirvana> How hard are you gonna jump on that orb when you get back
[1:18:35] <$AzureGale> big oof
[1:18:39] <+MooseIsGoose> thank ya
[1:18:49] <cherrycottontail> it's normally the next day

[1:19:42] <Puhff> oh

[1:20:03] <+MrAtheGreat> ngl fucking a trampoline sounds fun
[1:20:07] <mythrilcrafter> hmmm now that I think about it I actually wonder why it's the second shot that's so much more intense than the firat....
[1:20:10] <+MrAtheGreat> if not painful
[1:20:33] <+StevorenoElcamino> That’s what trampolines are for, they’re TRAMPolines.
[1:20:33] <@Jekado> yeah
[1:20:34] <%ShockzNDrawe> because it's more potent
[1:20:36] <@Jekado> i don't know why
[1:20:39] <Puhff> Hey did y'all know that they called them jump-olines until @PeachSaliva got on one? Keepo
[1:20:40] <%maskofmichael> long live paiges hooker boots
[1:20:47] <silver_stout> Same here paige
[1:20:48] <+MrAtheGreat> I assume because there's some of it left from the first?
[1:20:55] <%Promessa_EX> if first shot is bad iyou might have had covid
[1:21:05] <+indigo_xoxo> Then antibody response already in your Sysco when the second shot comes your body is in fight mode
[1:21:08] <+indigo_xoxo> I believe
[1:21:09] <+atwitchical> I think it's because your body knows how to fight it and goes hard.
[1:21:11] <$hrbeck_> Your body has built up antibodies and wants to use them by your second shot
[1:21:12] <UnImprest> it hurt to lift my arm for like 4 days
[1:21:14] <Puhff> roasted
[1:21:17] <udurbalanced> Every time I feel sad I think about you losing your mind over your 'that's why I'm skinny' joke and it fills me with joy.
[1:21:28] <mythrilcrafter> okay, that makes sense now :D
[1:21:31] <+CarnivorousBrain> What's the longest time anybody here has spent alone?
[1:21:52] <$cade_calrayn> OH THAT JOKE

[1:22:30] <$hrbeck_> Joke now
[1:22:32] <RatherUninteresting> with sentences like that you could've fooled me
[1:22:34] <+MrAtheGreat> the body hurting more because it knows how to fight what's coming into it better doesn't make me feel better about being in the presence of covid
[1:22:36] <Puhff> God, I thought you were going to DIE after you made that joke
[1:22:47] <Puhff> you wheezed so hard bro LUL

[1:29:11] <+MooseIsGoose> they made her hum to balance her so it is more noticeable
[1:29:13] <+TheLakinessMonster> Random question, would it be worth to convince friends to buy Dead By Daylight on the Switch, when the friend group already has Friday the 13?

[1:32:54] <+Blargimazombie> It will open when everyone else is dead yes
[1:32:59] <+indigo_xoxo> It’s more gens done than players left alive, but always opens with one survivor left regardless
[1:33:10] <+lynlyn_ow> 1 Survivor alive: becomes visible and opens regardless of how many Generators are completed
[1:33:17] <@SoFarFetched> yeah unfortunately with no gens being done, 3 gens need to at least be done.

[1:57:25] <@SoFarFetched> @Rozalyndis yeah Im glad the mashing isnt there anymore,Im only slightly sad its not there because of times I'd let go so someone would get hatch.
[1:57:32] <%SpaghettiTime44> @SoFarFetched Yeah, she realized that she had a hair appointment on Thursday and decided she didn't want to make the drive all over again
[1:57:34] <@Jekado> "I owe you one" "Heh put it on my BILL"
[1:57:36] <nivlac_555> less a choice and more the shitty situation we're stuck with
[1:57:41] <%Rozalyndis> i got my 2nd vaccine last month's end
[1:57:42] <%ShockzNDrawe> jekado get out
[1:57:43] <$QueequegTheater> @ShockzNDrawe I'm 27 but I live in a low population area and do accounting for doctors so we were pretty high up the list
[1:57:46] <PartyFavors> I got away with getting mine by volunteering for a day at a local vaccination clinic directing parking garage traffic
[1:57:57] <%Rozalyndis> i think i caught a cold in my weakened state

[2:01:18] <@Jekado> With Freddy you tend to not sleep on the job?
[2:01:18] <%Rozalyndis> strangely enough i did fairly well with ghostface
[2:01:29] <%Rozalyndis> i freaked pat the fuck out when we all played
[2:01:40] <%ShockzNDrawe> I remember I bought this game after having a conversation with Paige, installed it, and then uninstalled it 5 months later to make space for more games and have never touched it
[2:01:47] <+sterlingnano> Gad,  it's   so   weird seeing  Bill   in  the   rift
[2:02:13] <@SoFarFetched> @ShockzNDrawe get ssaryn,strident,Toy and I to play with you
[2:02:37] <Sotetsu> Paige introduced me to this game two years ago, and I still love it.
[2:02:40] <+sterlingnano> @ShockzNDrawe It's a  terrible  game.  I  love  it.  It's  great, I  fucking  hate it.  I've been  playing   since 4th  year   anniversary
[2:02:40] <%VashyronM> who plays as the killer in that? Strident?
[2:02:41] <%AncelDeLambert> I have not seen it in years despite having a copy... and I don't think I'm gonna see it anytime soon
[2:02:44] <$QueequegTheater> In a better timeline Megamind got the success it deserved and Despicable Me was a moderate failure
[2:02:48] <%AncelDeLambert> it is... of its time
[2:02:48] <+Credfield_> hey paige, what resident evil character would you like in the next update
[2:02:59] <$QueequegTheater> PRESENTATION
[2:03:00] <+kyh9> Megamind has stronger performances imo
[2:03:03] <TurtlesAndTentacles> Megamind is funny but its...meh to me
[2:03:08] <+indigo_xoxo> AGREED
[2:03:24] <akarchives> HAL WAS THE FIRST INCEL
[2:03:24] <%ShockzNDrawe> Megamind is pretty good, but I'm a bit biased more towards how to train your dragon and rise of the guardians
[2:03:32] <Jaysky> Well yeah, if it came otu right now it would be a parody of superhero tropes
[2:03:34] <+kyh9> One of the only good parodies of Superman.  Not Evil Superman but "What if Superman just got bored?"
[2:03:38] <Jaysky> And superheroes are HUGE right now
[2:03:39] <%maskofmichael> megamind mega rules
[2:03:40] <TurtlesAndTentacles> BANANA!!
[2:03:42] <satiresatyr> same
[2:03:47] <%ospreyworks> It's one of the VERY few roles I love Will Farrell in
[2:03:53] <%SpaghettiTime44> oh god, my mom LOVES the minions and I HATE it
[2:03:57] <+Taisuru> SweetCheeks!
[2:03:58] <TurtlesAndTentacles> I like Despicable me because of Tron Bonne. He is male Tron Bonne
[2:04:00] <$QueequegTheater> I mean, it came out several years after Incredibles.  I don't think Megamind is super ahead of its time but Incredibles was the best kids movie within ten years in either direction
[2:04:03] <+ChaseArcade> I loved Megamind. It has two of my favorite moments in animation history. The part where he’s in the giant mech and is sneaking around the buildings and when he confronts Titan with Guns’n’Roses playing.
[2:04:07] <+kyh9> Kung Fu Panda 2 is underrated too
[2:04:14] <karovus> despicable me is alright but i dont care about the minions. megamind is far superior
[2:04:18] <TurtlesAndTentacles> The Minions are basically Servbots. I love it
[2:04:18] <$QueequegTheater> @ChaseArcade PRESENTATION
[2:04:23] <$heatbugg> magamind always sucked me right out of being invested cuz the soundtrack songs are some of the most worn out pop songs of all time
[2:04:31] <%ospreyworks> I enjoyed the message of Megamind more than the message of the Incredibles
[2:04:34] <TurtlesAndTentacles> I wont take Minion or Servbot slanger
[2:04:35] <%Rozalyndis> sipsipDab sipsipDab
[2:04:38] <%SpaghettiTime44> nice
[2:04:41] <TurtlesAndTentacles> slander
[2:04:52] <%ShockzNDrawe> you mean BEASTIES?!
[2:05:00] <+ChaseArcade> @queequegtheater IT WAS SO GOOD! Like the best wrestling segment to never take place in wrestling.
[2:05:05] <+PharosOfLight> Megamind is great, hopefully it will someday see a resurgence in popularity much like Emperor's New Groove is experiencing now
[2:05:07] <%AncelDeLambert> Kung Fu Panda 2 is better than 1, and 1 was great
[2:05:11] <Jaysky> I still think ReBoot and Beasties/Beast Wars looks great (for it's time)
[2:05:11] <TurtlesAndTentacles> Everytime you says Beast Wars, i hear the beginning in my head. BEAST WARS
[2:05:11] <%Rozalyndis> real adventures of johnny quest. anyone remember that?
[2:05:12] <%SpaghettiTime44> and you love optimus primal
[2:05:15] <%ShockzNDrawe> fun fact Paige, thee's a major animation error durring dinobot's funeral
[2:05:20] <%Lumkins> Lumkins subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 10 months!
[2:05:22] <@SoFarFetched> she'd go PRIMAL over him geefPlz
[2:05:27] <%ospreyworks> Megamind was when Dreamworks really started to hit their stride
[2:05:32] <%ShockzNDrawe> they used rattrap's pre transmetal model in the background
[2:05:38] <%ospreyworks> *their 3D stride
[2:05:41] <%maskofmichael> maskofmichael subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 19 months! how would you feel if someone wrote a fanfic about you and/or pat?
[2:05:49] <TurtlesAndTentacles> NERD S
[2:05:57] <$QueequegTheater> @ChaseArcade I mean, I think Goku and Freeza vs. Jiren is pretty far up there, regardless of the unevenness of DBS in general
[2:06:01] <+ChaseArcade> Megatron was so badass in Beast Wars. He goes from T-Rex to giant fucking Dragon. The best.
[2:06:08] <%maskofmichael> but optimus is not a skeleton
[2:06:08] <@Jekado> There has been Pat fanfics
[2:06:13] <%SpaghettiTime44> Oh jeez, Jenna has some doozies
[2:06:15] <+ChaseArcade> @queequegtheater agreed
[2:06:17] <%CopperTucker> Beast Wars holds up really well
[2:06:23] <+kyh9> Paige: thoughts on FF4 3: Endwalker?
[2:06:26] <KCfusecoast> Oh jeez
[2:06:34] <Jaysky> I know of the Woolie shaving fanfic
[2:06:36] <+kyh9> There are some Profession Football fanfics
[2:06:37] <@SoFarFetched> @SpaghettiTime44 reading those at 5AM that one morning was something I'd never expect geefBruh
[2:06:37] <+BigChiefBear> i open mouth kissed a horse once, bet you diddnt know that
[2:06:41] <Puhff> DansGame
[2:06:43] <$QueequegTheater> Real people fanfics weird me out
[2:06:46] <KCfusecoast> I love Beastwars
[2:06:47] <TurtlesAndTentacles> BEAST MACHINES WAS GREAT
[2:06:53] <%ospreyworks> I appreciate the love Beast Wars got in the comics in the recent years
[2:06:55] <+Gespens> Beast Machines DansGame
[2:06:57] <$QueequegTheater> I still "enjoy" them but at least I feel guilty afterward
[2:06:57] <%SpaghettiTime44> @SoFarFetched they're a LOT to take in
[2:06:58] <+Taisuru> Beast Machines DansGame
[2:06:59] <%ShockzNDrawe> Oh I did that lats year
[2:07:04] <%ShockzNDrawe> it's not great
[2:07:04] <+Gespens> How about Shadow Raiders?
[2:07:06] <%ShockzNDrawe> but eh
[2:07:06] <Puhff> Imagine writing a fanfic about Pat's dong
[2:07:14] <+BigChiefBear> BEASTIES
[2:07:23] <TurtlesAndTentacles> NEVER I WILL DIE ON THIS HILL WITH EVIL RHINOX
[2:07:23] <satiresatyr> i dont like rpf either :(
[2:07:23] <@SoFarFetched> @SpaghettiTime44 I was like "...this is something I never thought of but also somehow not surprised geefNLT "
[2:07:35] <@Jekado> I still have my Depthcharge Transmetal toy!
[2:07:36] <+ChaseArcade> I had the toys of Rattrap and Scorpinok as a kid. I freaking loved them. There’s newer Beast Wars figures in the Transformers line that are top tier.
[2:07:37] <%ospreyworks> #Airazordeservedbetter
[2:07:37] <%Rozalyndis> anybody remember that show herman's head? no? me either
[2:07:37] <@Jekado> he dope
[2:07:44] <+BigChiefBear> Beast individuals
[2:07:55] <%Ranryu692> thought Megamind was "meh" but Beast Machines was great?
[2:08:01] <+Taisuru> Put em up turtles
[2:08:08] <%CopperTucker> there's a fucking fix-it fic of the channel breakup
[2:08:09] <TurtlesAndTentacles> I LOVED IT SO MUCH. OH MY GOD
[2:08:09] <$QueequegTheater> It's a WWE feud
[2:08:09] <@Jekado> God Evil Rhinox really ruined it for me
[2:08:11] <@Jekado> like i couldn't
[2:08:13] <+ChaseArcade> I saw Beast Machines on a random weekend and was like “The fuck!”
[2:08:16] <+Gespens> WHY DID RATTRAP FUCK A TREE
[2:08:17] <DickieWoodsmall_279> are you guys fighting a beast wars war?
[2:08:22] <%ospreyworks> They no homo'd Rattrap
[2:08:24] <$QueequegTheater> Paige is like Brock lesnar with a smaller chest in this feud
[2:08:25] <TurtlesAndTentacles> This is legit the only time we've disagreed lol
[2:08:30] <%ShockzNDrawe> it's like they forgot how to write all of the characters
[2:08:35] <%ShockzNDrawe> rattrap became a coward
[2:08:36] <TurtlesAndTentacles> WASPITOR TWIST WAS GREAT
[2:08:41] <Maids4lyfe> beast machines was awful
[2:08:43] <%ShockzNDrawe> silverbolt was an edgelord
[2:08:45] <+Gespens> Jet Stream's voice actor was good tho
[2:08:51] <Jaysky> I remember not liking Beast Machines at all
[2:08:52] <TurtlesAndTentacles> NO. PLOT TWIST
[2:08:55] <%Rozalyndis> welcome to how i feel about ff7r
[2:08:55] <%CopperTucker> everyone looks like dogshit in Beast Machines too
[2:08:59] <%Rozalyndis> just make a new game
[2:09:09] <Jaysky> I remember most everything about Beasties but I have VERY little memories of Beast Machines
[2:09:10] <%ShockzNDrawe> Not a complete pansy though
[2:09:11] <%brokendarktower> i hate what they did with megatron specifically
[2:09:16] <TurtlesAndTentacles> I mean technically it was a virus....
[2:09:18] <%ShockzNDrawe> rattrap did smart combat
[2:09:22] <%SpaghettiTime44> Nah, they gotta subvert expectations
[2:09:23] <+D00msDayDan> some sort of biocurse
[2:09:24] <%ShockzNDrawe> in beast machines he just runs waya
[2:09:24] <+BigChiefBear> member that spooky episode of beast wars where there was like, an ET and they fought over it? gave me Mr Burns alien vibes
[2:09:32] <Puhff> ce la vie
[2:09:32] <@SoFarFetched> Beast machine? More like Yeast machine
[2:09:43] <@Jekado> bread making robots?
[2:09:45] <%Ranryu692> LUL
[2:09:46] <@Jekado> i'd watch that
[2:09:47] <Jaysky> Very possible
[2:09:55] <%Shotgun_Hobo1> Would legit like a podcast of Paige and Woolie talking about Beast Wars/Machines
[2:09:55] <%ShockzNDrawe> I wonder what the cancled 3rd show would have been like if it actually got made
[2:10:07] <Jaysky> I just remember being confused how it worked into Beasties
[2:10:08] <%Ranryu692> apparently there are about to be some Transformers comics that are basically "what if the Autobots were the bad guys and the Decepticons were freedom fighters"
[2:10:11] <+Gespens> Trans Mutate
[2:10:14] <+ChaseArcade> They need to quit with the Transformers movies for awhile and give us Beast Wars by the guy who did Godzilla or Godzilla King of the Monsters. That’d be dope.
[2:10:15] <+Gespens> it was Rampage and Silverbolt
[2:10:16] <%ShockzNDrawe> transmutate
[2:10:18] <+axenred> Inferno
[2:10:19] <%ospreyworks> It was far less interesting than Beast Wars, far less fun, more pedantically philosophical, and it just BUTCHERED the characters.
[2:10:19] <TurtlesAndTentacles> @SoFarFetched I will make all bread with the YEast Machine
[2:10:22] <$QueequegTheater> I have watched Nightmare on Elm Street 2 more than three times and still only remember it being wildly homoerotic in a really inappropriate way
[2:10:26] <+kyh9> Peach, you may like Garrus but we all know that Space Turtles are where it's at
[2:10:32] <%ShockzNDrawe> that episode bummed me the fuck out
[2:10:33] <$QueequegTheater> So I can vouch for the spotty memory thing
[2:10:37] <%ospreyworks> Inferno was amazing
[2:10:42] <+kyh9> Back in my day, it was just Mutating
[2:10:42] <@Jekado> @ShockzNDrawe There is a weird Japanese spin off of beast machines Optimus prime is a lion in that one.
[2:10:45] <%CopperTucker> I would have loved the Waspinator comic where he goes on adventures across the universe to get back to cybertron
[2:10:46] <+Gespens> Transmutate did a LOT to humanize Rampage
[2:10:49] <%ShockzNDrawe> well no it was rampage and silverbolt
[2:10:57] <%ShockzNDrawe> depthcharge wasn't in the show yet
[2:10:58] <+BigChiefBear> random more mature themes than usual with that ep
[2:11:07] <TurtlesAndTentacles> Boo inferno cause Im fighting with Paige
[2:11:10] <%CopperTucker> @Gespens Oh absolutely. That was a fantastic episode.
[2:11:15] <@Jekado> Depthcharge was later
[2:11:15] <%ShockzNDrawe> yeah that's beast wars II
[2:11:22] <@Jekado> Shocking!
[2:11:23] <silver_stout> should i look up this beast wars thing?
[2:11:24] <@Jekado> the doctor!
[2:11:25] <%ShockzNDrawe> with leo convoy
[2:11:27] <%SpaghettiTime44> Alright, I just stopped by to say hi, have a good stream Paige and chat!
[2:11:27] <akarchives> PRAISE CARTER
[2:11:28] <PartyFavors> hiiiiiiiii doc
[2:11:32] <%ospreyworks> Primal becoming insufferable to the point that Cheetor was forced to be the leader by the end of BM
[2:11:37] <Jaysky> Why Doc gotta be so mean
[2:11:37] <%ospreyworks> Criminal.
[2:11:40] <%ShockzNDrawe> and then there's beast wars neo with big convoy who's a bison
[2:11:41] <@SoFarFetched> @SpaghettiTime44 bye spaghettiii see you next time either in discord or twitch geefSmush
[2:11:45] <+NickyDynamite> I dont think I'd frequent a doctor that didnt have sleeves
[2:11:46] <%Rozalyndis> the doctor is such a sweaty teddy killer
[2:11:49] <@Jekado> oh difficult checks
[2:11:50] <+MayorRev> skippidi bop mm dada
[2:11:55] <%ShockzNDrawe> I know way too much stupid shit about transformers it's actually a problem
[2:12:10] <@SoFarFetched> oh he had Overcharge
[2:12:14] <+sterlingnano> Wait  a second,  it's  bright out.  It's  daylight.   You're  not  dead.  Survivors  win
[2:12:15] <@SoFarFetched> cause he kicked it
[2:12:15] <+democrazyyy> ive just started getting into this game thanks to your stream vods and doctor is by far the most fun ive had playing it so far
[2:12:17] <%ospreyworks> Oh and the bat kid with the stupid John Conners hair flop?
[2:12:20] <TurtlesAndTentacles> Who here liked the Transformers Anime, IE Armada, Minicon Saga, ETC
[2:12:24] <ashenfrenzy> doc is fun, make people scream a lot
[2:12:26] <$QueequegTheater> We don't come here to see you learn, Paige
[2:12:27] <@Jekado> we should watch some transformers @ShockzNDrawe
[2:12:29] <+Gespens> It's really sad, that it took me 24 years to realize that Rampage was a crab LUL
[2:12:37] <%Rozalyndis> i know too much about zelda and metroid
[2:12:39] <%ShockzNDrawe> shit serriously?
[2:12:50] <+kyh9> I remember that one horrific show about talking air planes
[2:12:51] <PartyFavors> Favorite engine?
[2:12:56] <LtSurge> Thomas has too much lore
[2:12:57] <+TheLakinessMonster> It's crazy how some media is cross-generational and national.
[2:12:58] <+sterlingnano> @democrazyyy If  you're playing   on   PS4 don't  forget  to  get Huntress for  free   on  PSN
[2:13:00] <+Gespens> @kyh9 JJ The Jet Plane?
[2:13:02] <@Jekado> @Rozalyndis I've seen your LTTP randomizers they are so good!
[2:13:04] <%ShockzNDrawe> I sometimes go back and rewatch all the old thomas series just because I like dysecting hoe they filmed all of it
[2:13:05] <$QueequegTheater> That timing was perfect
[2:13:07] <%Lumkins> Have Thomas the Tank Engine and Transformers ever crossed over? If not, what a missed opportunity
[2:13:10] <%ShockzNDrawe> it's a greta miniature show
[2:13:11] <fairore> i think i seen beast wars once and remember thinking  wtf is this wheres my regular transfomers
[2:13:13] <%ShockzNDrawe> *great
[2:13:16] <silver_stout> @PeachSaliva would you recommend beast wars and how should i watch it/where i should watch it?
[2:13:22] <$QueequegTheater> "I'm here to teach OH GOD DAMN IT"

[2:14:12] <+kyh9> Have you seen those Hot Topic cartoons?
[2:14:15] <%ospreyworks> What was it with Mainframe Entertainment and casting voice actors who just ATE UP those villain roles?
[2:14:20] <%ShockzNDrawe> it's live right now
[2:14:25] <%ShockzNDrawe> OnlyTransformers

[2:14:48] <@Jekado> Japan had a LOT of Transformers spin offs
[2:14:56] <+Gespens> @ospreyworks Rest in Peace, Tony Jay
[2:15:08] <+PharosOfLight> I once met the VA for Optimus Primal. He also did Dr. Frankenfingers on ReBoot. We had a long talk about it. Really nice guy
[2:15:10] <$thomassolorio> i want dematressk ot tim curry in this game
[2:15:13] <%ospreyworks> @Gespens Ugh, it still hurts.
[2:15:15] <@Jekado> Ironically Daiclone is also trying to get a revitilation in Japan,  which Tranformers was bassed on ?
[2:15:16] <@SoFarFetched> look they need to be good screams geefPoint
[2:15:26] <@SoFarFetched> Thats from the rift last year
[2:15:28] <%ShockzNDrawe> does anyone find it funny that in reboot Enzo unironically becomes a jaded edgelord due to being exposed to the Internet for the first time.
[2:15:39] <%Prism_Wing> triKEK
[2:15:39] <DickieWoodsmall_279> what a ho

[2:15:58] <peyodogo> she just wanted you to get to see her outfit for longer
[2:16:00] <$QueequegTheater> It's her time of the month
[2:16:02] <+democrazyyy> i remember forcing myself to get past the animation of beast wars once and loving it, but i have a hard time going back to it now for some reason
[2:16:09] <%Rozalyndis> ahh the 90s. "lemme borrow that top"
[2:16:15] <%brokendarktower> hey paige, has anyone asked before whats your favorite x-men character? and thoughts on the x-men franchise?
[2:16:16] <@SoFarFetched> Paige I was sending you the outfits and stuff geefPoint
[2:16:22] <%ospreyworks> I don't know if anyone has gone as hard as David Kaye and Tony Jay on a villainous voice except MAYBE Tim Curry.
[2:16:23] <akarchives> where are the sanity effects I wanna see those fake pallets
[2:16:29] <@Jekado> fashion By Daylight
[2:16:41] <peyodogo> ruh roh

[2:16:44] <$QueequegTheater> One day I'll get a Pig rework so I can enjoy the game
[2:16:49] <Oxybe> God some streamer noises are too real with my earphones. There's a British streamer that i follow who has a door knocking sfx for bit donations. scares the crap out of me when it happens at like 5am.
[2:16:59] <$QueequegTheater> Or she'll just get more nerfs Sadge
[2:17:05] <$RenegadeHatter> DBD is like a repressed memory, just when you thought you've forgotten about it there it is
[2:17:23] <+sterlingnano> He has  BBQ
[2:17:32] <+sterlingnano> He  saw  the syrvivor  behind   the  wall

[2:18:20] <+Taisuru> psaCrazyhand psaCrazyhead
[2:18:29] <%Rozalyndis> reminds me when we were all playing and i dodged shy twice and you and pat both hooted and blew my cover rozalyLel
[2:18:31] <@SoFarFetched> its only 40 meters and outward you get detected,unless hiding in a locker.
[2:18:31] <akarchives> your sacrifice will be remembered in the coming empire
[2:18:40] <+sterlingnano> WHO   USES  NOED?
[2:18:53] <tanarath> Paige, go do gens
[2:18:57] <@SoFarFetched> yeah you're gonna have to possibly leave them if he's gonna use them as bait.
[2:19:00] <$QueequegTheater> NOED is great, I love it
[2:19:03] <@SoFarFetched> she did gens LUL
[2:19:08] <+Demerson13> lots of bad killers use noed

[2:19:35] <%maskofmichael> no your not
[2:19:41] <Sotetsu> peepoLeave
[2:19:45] <$QueequegTheater> NOED counters adrenaline and I run into a LOT of adrenaline
[2:19:54] <+TheLakinessMonster> Survivors Remorse vs Scoreboard. Which is better?
[2:19:55] <DickieWoodsmall_279> you are guilty paige, you murdered those people yourself, with your own hands
[2:19:55] <$QueequegTheater> At least I did when I still played lol
[2:20:00] <+sterlingnano> Getting  closer  to  Yellow   ranks
[2:20:23] <silver_stout> no more transformers talk?
[2:20:33] <$QueequegTheater> Fictional murder is hot because I am a deeply broken person
[2:20:35] <@Jekado> I remember almost wanting to preorder that offical Unicron toy for 800 dollars but it had to be crowd funded.  I couldn't rationalize getting it.
[2:20:40] <Kon_zetsu> konzetPopcorn How are the games going tonight Peach?
[2:20:52] <silver_stout> unicron terrifed me as a kid
[2:20:57] <$QueequegTheater> @Kon_zetsu she murdered the other survivors just now
[2:20:59] <akarchives> any survivor that runs Decisive Strike or Borrowed Time doesn't get to say shit about NOED
[2:21:07] <heartlesshealer> oh right, that OnlyTransformers channel got dinged, so they moved to a different handle/channel
[2:21:09] <Kon_zetsu> For shame XD
[2:21:18] <TurtlesAndTentacles> But Paige has Streamer BUCKS
[2:21:24] <$RenegadeHatter> Just waiting to here when that Spirit Statue goes up for Sale
[2:21:29] <+sterlingnano> @akarchives Yes,   bowrrowed  time.  The  anti-camping  perk  is  equivalent  to  Noed
[2:21:32] <jowi_time> LUL

[2:22:36] <noirxgwen> Hey Paige, any chance you are gonna play Re Village?
[2:22:45] <@Jekado> Did you guys see that Optimus Prime toy thats an acutal robot that operations on voice commands
[2:22:46] <$DeaDHer015> evo18Hiyo evo18Hiyo
[2:22:48] <Sotetsu> We need a skeleton killer in dbd otzGib
[2:22:52] <@Jekado> you can tell him to transform and fight and everything
[2:22:55] <+democrazyyy> will we ever get to see you bang hot bird men aliens in mass effect?
[2:22:57] <$RenegadeHatter> ***
[2:23:02] <heartlesshealer> ah, automod
[2:23:03] <LtSurge> I really want that Optimus
[2:23:04] <peyodogo> nefarious alcohols
[2:23:04] <Kon_zetsu> A skeleton killer would be so dam good
[2:23:14] <heartlesshealer> probably private message the link to Paige
[2:23:18] <DickieWoodsmall_279> is there like a clubhouse for skeleton-loving babes? as a skeleton myself this topic interests me
[2:23:23] <tanarath> paige...
[2:23:26] <@Jekado> "I did this?  I DID THIS" - Paige talking to her wine.
[2:23:27] <+democrazyyy> but hes so hot tho
[2:23:30] <$RenegadeHatter> It hasn't had a full painted version displayed to my knowledge but thats what it looks like
[2:23:34] <%Rozalyndis> if you win it's cuz of how awesome you are; if you lose it's because it's a team effort and the whole team let you down
[2:23:37] <TurtlesAndTentacles> every lady does
[2:23:38] <tanarath> He's a cop, Paige
[2:23:40] <$QueequegTheater> Paige I remember how the last Mass Effect stream went
[2:23:40] <%brokendarktower> whats ur favorite x-men character paige
[2:23:49] <@SoFarFetched> oh yeah links aren't allowed in here,but if its from Wonder Festival 2020
[2:23:55] <@SoFarFetched> I DM'd it to you Paige.
[2:23:56] <s1rcuit> does Paige know about Necrons?
[2:23:57] <Kon_zetsu> Yea, legion has a "skeleton" outfit....but thats about the closest
[2:23:57] <+sterlingnano> Hag  is  also  a  bit  of  skeleton/zombie
[2:24:01] <$QueequegTheater> He also becomes a vigilante
[2:24:01] <@Jekado> It would be dope if its Stop motion Skeletons!
[2:24:05] <tanarath> Yeah....
[2:24:06] <FujoshiCadet> skeleton warrior would be fun
[2:24:12] <$QueequegTheater> @PeachSaliva He literally BECOMES one
[2:24:16] <+D00msDayDan> even better
[2:24:22] <peyodogo> oh i'm so down for that mass effect playthrough! don't be afraid to push the difficulty down btw, the first game in particular is a bit wonky
[2:24:23] <deathygz> hag is all mud and go es
[2:24:25] <$RenegadeHatter> @SoFarFetched Oh she said it was okay, but I didn't know. Thank you!
[2:24:27] <deathygz> bones
[2:24:32] <%Bane_Kaikyo> Garrus is bird? am confused
[2:24:36] <$QueequegTheater> My favorite author was Lovecraft, I can easily separate fiction from reality
[2:24:37] <@SoFarFetched> @RenegadeHatter she probably forgot links arent' allowed in here is why LUL
[2:24:40] <tanarath> Just... remember you have to drag him being cringe in two games.
[2:24:43] <PinoProxie> he has "avian" properties
[2:24:45] <%Rozalyndis> do you remember that ice tea commercial from the 90s paige where a skeleton is in like sweltering LA heat and melting to his car, gets out and walks to a gas station for a beverage?
[2:24:45] <Kon_zetsu> That would be great
[2:24:48] <$RenegadeHatter> LUL
[2:24:53] <%arcaderabbit48> Does Garrus have a cloaca?
[2:24:54] <FujoshiCadet> lol what if dark souls was a killer
[2:24:56] <@SoFarFetched> I sent it to you Paige
[2:24:59] <@SoFarFetched> so its fine
[2:24:59] <heartlesshealer> that would seem incredibly strong against low latency players
[2:25:02] <+democrazyyy> i wanna see some more fantastical stuff like a ghost/spectre or some kind of werewolf. more monsters less dudes in halloween costumes
[2:25:09] <$thomassolorio> thats so fetch
[2:25:15] <PartyFavors> I too want a werewolf killer
[2:25:16] <%CopperTucker> I would love a werewolf
[2:25:18] <DickieWoodsmall_279> do not ingest
[2:25:19] <+cvp5127> worth the risk
[2:25:21] <%AncelDeLambert> Mordan mentions "friction"
[2:25:22] <$QueequegTheater> I'm surprised every day when Paige's laptop does not explode and kill her
[2:25:25] <tanarath> Yes
[2:25:25] <+sterlingnano> Oh Paige, have you  heard  of  Identity   V? it's  a  DBD  clone  on  mobile  that  has  crazier abilities  and  crossovers  with  Danganronps  AND  Persona 5
[2:25:25] <heartlesshealer> Yeah, the bodily fluids are a health risk to humans
[2:25:34] <peyodogo> look sometimes you gotta
[2:25:37] <heartlesshealer> Doctor specifically tells you not to swallow
[2:25:39] <+cvp5127> yolo
[2:25:40] <tanarath> He's dextro-based.
[2:25:48] <Sotetsu> I always liked Talli
[2:25:56] <@SoFarFetched> oh boy a mori
[2:25:58] <@SoFarFetched> geefDarth
[2:25:59] <tanarath> So latex & condoms are key.
[2:25:59] <$QueequegTheater> Paige you literally have an autoimmune disorder you would almost instantly die
[2:26:04] <+ThatGuyfromMars> you gotta take one for the team, but also take one from the team
[2:26:06] <%CopperTucker> Garrus is best husbando
[2:26:07] <+Gouf_Troop> Tali is the best
[2:26:12] <+D00msDayDan> turians and quarians have a different protein structure, drinking their cum will mess with your innards
[2:26:20] <$QueequegTheater> Tali is unreasonably thicc
[2:26:26] <Sotetsu> It's gonna be a bumpy ride
[2:26:27] <+sterlingnano> Just  run  to  an  open  area.   You'll be  fine
[2:26:29] <peyodogo> wrex is big chungus
[2:26:30] <$QueequegTheater> WREX
[2:26:31] <Noahccountingfortaste> wrex is the big guy
[2:26:33] <peyodogo> he's SO GOOD
[2:26:36] <$QueequegTheater> "SHEPARD."
[2:26:36] <silver_stout> wrex is big boy
[2:26:37] <+MisterTylerrr> ngl.  Kinda gay for Wrex
[2:26:37] <tanarath> Tali is great when she isn't being machine-racist.
[2:26:38] <PinoProxie> Shepherd.
[2:26:40] <$AzureGale> Wrex. Shepard. Wrex. Shepard. Wrex. Shepard. Wrex. Shepard. Wrex. Shepard. Wrex. Shepard. Wrex. Shepard. Wrex. Shepard. Wrex. Shepard. Wrex. Shepard.
[2:26:45] <Sotetsu> ... can you romance Wrex?
[2:26:46] <%brokendarktower> tali is best did u see they fixed the final pic of her in the 3rd game its not the bad photoshop of that model
[2:26:47] <DickieWoodsmall_279> he wrex the booty
[2:26:50] <+cvp5127> play a big soldier lady
[2:26:51] <peyodogo> @QueequegTheater WREX
[2:26:57] <+democrazyyy> krogan have 4 balls
[2:26:58] <+ThatGuyfromMars> Yeah I'll hop on the talimancer train
[2:26:59] <tanarath> Wrex is the fucking best
[2:27:01] <%VashyronM> You cannot romance Wrex
[2:27:02] <+MisterTylerrr> Wrex also has 4 testes.  So you know he's got the goo
[2:27:04] <+ProfessorMorrigan> Shepaaaaaard
[2:27:06] <PinoProxie> No
[2:27:06] <tanarath> NO
[2:27:08] <+altwaal05> i want Wrex to choke me with his quad~
[2:27:12] <+ausl0> pat in shambles
[2:27:13] <PinoProxie> wrex is not for sex
[2:27:14] <+cvp5127> eww
[2:27:17] <Sotetsu> Wrex romance mod when?
[2:27:17] <tanarath> Bioware were fucking cowards
[2:27:24] <+democrazyyy> what if you fall in love with a human in 1 to scandalously dump them for the bird dick
[2:27:26] <$QueequegTheater> The only good human romance is gaying it up with Cortez
[2:27:26] <herotony04> We’ll bang ok
[2:27:26] <anAngryHamster> Garrus and Wrex are almost universally the faves
[2:27:29] <%Rozalyndis> i'll fall in love with a succubus. why not
[2:27:29] <heartlesshealer> bioware were always cowards
[2:27:32] <Noahccountingfortaste> Tali best
[2:27:33] <%Rozalyndis> she needs love too
[2:27:34] <+D00msDayDan> tfw me2 could have had gay sex but bioware didn't want fox news to get mad at them
[2:27:34] <+MisterTylerrr> LEMME FUCK THE TURTLE!!
[2:27:36] <blue8moon> why would you choose a boring human when you could have a weird alien?
[2:27:36] <%CopperTucker> I would have totally romanced Wrex
[2:27:37] <$AzureGale> Tali also
[2:27:38] <SubjectX07x> Only correct answer is the forbidden fruit, Tali.
[2:27:39] <%VashyronM> I don't really care for the Asari
[2:27:39] <peyodogo> imagine being in space and banging a human, couldnt be me
[2:27:43] <%CopperTucker> I'm an alienfucker through and through
[2:27:47] <silver_stout> i really liked cortez
[2:27:51] <tanarath> Blue lady is 100 but also 12.
[2:27:54] <$QueequegTheater> @PeachSaliva There is also a green lizard man who is a beautiful man
[2:28:00] <%CopperTucker> blue lady's boring tbh
[2:28:01] <+ThatGuyfromMars> Yeah I feel like Bioware gave us Liara to test the waters, then 2 was like yeah go ahead and fuck the aliens
[2:28:01] <cherrycottontail> blue ladies are basically succubi
[2:28:02] <+OmegaFatalis> It's like they purposely made all the humans the most uninteresting characters
[2:28:17] <%CopperTucker> once Liara stops being Liara she gets way more interesting
[2:28:20] <tanarath> NO emotional maturity.
[2:28:20] <+democrazyyy> LUL
[2:28:22] <$QueequegTheater> Jack is pretty cool too now that I think about it

[2:29:00] <heartlesshealer> Thane seemed cool. And so did our synthetic lifeform party member
[2:29:21] <heartlesshealer> then again my memory's a bit hazy on their social things because I also went for Garrus
[2:29:25] <+doomunderthestairs> A live Peach steam!
[2:29:39] <$RenegadeHatter> You know what, he might have an obsession based perkk
[2:29:45] <peyodogo> jack being restricted to male sheps is an absolute crime
[2:29:49] <BalterEgo> she don't want no heals
[2:29:51] <spongeofmystery> Bunch of ingrates is what's happening
[2:29:57] <+democrazyyy> so is garrus being restricted to fem sheps
[2:30:14] <BalterEgo> that's not how you heal people?
[2:30:16] <DickieWoodsmall_279> makes me feel better
[2:30:17] <$AzureGale> The power of arousal
[2:30:19] <peyodogo> soothing ass rubs
[2:30:21] <Sotetsu> Rub em good
[2:30:21] <+ThatGuyfromMars> and Nyreen was restricted to nobody
[2:30:23] <tanarath> Just rub dat ass

[2:39:14] <cyclog> He is lifting weights
[2:39:19] <+Credfield_> if he wants to help then he'd pick you up until you struggle out and go to hatch
[2:39:28] <@SoFarFetched> As someone who has tried to talk to survivors to let them know I wont hurt them LUL
[2:39:28] <+The_Protagonist> this is cute actually haha
[2:39:31] <+Credfield_> I do that when one of their team disconnects
[2:39:34] <Sotetsu> He's dripping his goo all over
[2:39:37] <Noahccountingfortaste> this map can be a real pain to find hatch on
[2:39:41] <BalterEgo> LOL
[2:39:41] <spongeofmystery> "What are we going to do on the hatch, onii-chan?"
[2:39:42] <+The_Protagonist> I WAS JUST ABOUT TO SAY THAT haha

[2:40:04] <+sterlingnano> all I  have  to say  about  bli8ght,  is that  I'm  glad he   came out   before   covid
[2:40:05] <Noahccountingfortaste> no

[2:40:34] <@SoFarFetched> Ive had to look all over for hatch at times LUL
[2:40:36] <+The_Protagonist> he might give up because he can't find it and say "fuck it" and hang you up anyway lol
[2:40:37] <$RenegadeHatter> Be pretty awkward to put a dead person on the hook
[2:40:38] <+BettyMwwaahh> she kinda got a booty
[2:40:39] <Noahccountingfortaste> this tends to happen if killers feel bad after a DC
[2:40:42] <@Jekado> sometiems they give hatch when someone DCs
[2:40:44] <%ClericOfSparda> I would just kill you and be done with it
[2:40:46] <cyclog> This is just a park trip
