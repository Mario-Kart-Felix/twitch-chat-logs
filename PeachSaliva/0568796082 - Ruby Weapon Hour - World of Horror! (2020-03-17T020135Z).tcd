[0:20:35] <%ArtemisM822> I hope it wakes up the US to health care issues
[0:20:35] <@ckbooks> The problem is assuming that people are smart and learn from experience.
[0:20:36] <Deekman> I work in alberta with oilfield services. This has fucked my business
[0:20:36] <%TheFilth> the boomers will be scarred trying to make Skype work

[0:20:49] <$Sphincter_Spelunker> @marvel877 oof
[0:20:49] <sharpington_> I think "we can 't do this as an email" actually means "we don't trust you chucklefucks to read this shit"
[0:20:50] <%rumtumtugnutz> There's not gonna be big sweeping change
[0:20:56] <Revan175757> Does Nuclear Station count as nightmarish?
[0:20:56] <Shion963> but you have to have people in seats facing monitors

This action was often accompanied by a rhyme:My granny is sick and now is deadAnd we'll go mould some cocklety breadUp with the heels and down with the headAnd that's the way to make cocklety bread.

But you never came back and was gone for hours,until you messaged me going "shit I forgot about our Call of Cthulhu session". One day Paige,one day.
