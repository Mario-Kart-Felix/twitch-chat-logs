[0:16:30] <%KeiganOfAstora> Zangief's head is bigger than Paige's head
[0:16:30] <LVL1_Scumbag> That's not the point
[0:16:33] <ShichiNoBushi> Why now and not earlier?
[0:16:34] <%BallerSwagBro9k> YOU LOST 10?
[0:16:34] <+realm_forge> GREAT MORE GLASSES TO LOOSE
[0:16:35] <Dhurkst> .....
[0:16:36] <%Mr_Pylon> Can you get a monthly subscription?
[0:16:36] <%dekkitout> That seems like good math
[0:16:37] <+lordaloha> Been watching for multiple years on youtube, first time I've ever been able to tune in during the actual stream.
[0:16:38] <Coystick> My glasses cost 1500 dollars the FUCK
[0:16:38] <%Skelegroove> You need a rack of glasses next to the streaming setup
[0:16:38] <roarinlala> are you EATING the glasses?
[0:16:41] <%Bt_Robot> HOW DO YOU LOSE TEN PAIRS OF GLASSES?
[0:16:42] <%KeiganOfAstora> Lost all 10
[0:16:42] <%ssjklyco> Did you check your car?
[0:16:46] <+Bailey__gaming> @patstaresat buy 20 this time
[0:16:47] <Monkeyweed21> HOW
[0:16:48] <%TheWinged7> Maybe its time for Paige to go to the optometrist again to get a new prescription
[0:16:48] <+McSoliace> how fast did you lose them all
[0:16:48] <filialpails> too bad they're not lost-resistant
[0:16:49] <skrewarrior> how do you lose glasses?
[0:16:50] <%Zeif00> Broke?
[0:16:50] <%Parapattern> Probably misses her old glasses
[0:16:51] <Dhurkst> Jesus fuck paige
[0:16:51] <%Garthunox> HOW ABOUT YOU GET LOST RESISTANT ONES?
[0:16:52] <Ner234> Paige wtf
[0:16:52] <xeros720> you shouldn't buy ones made out of sugar glass, they taste too good
[0:16:52] <+shruke> You should tape a pair of glasses to the wall
[0:16:52] <peachy996> and bitchy cantankerous shouldr angels
[0:16:53] <%KeiganOfAstora> LUL
[0:16:53] <@MelBrooksKA> You lost 100$ worth of glasses...
[0:16:53] <GarbageQueenEllie> "JINKEES, I can't see without my GLASSES"
[0:16:54] <Zaphire_Saucypants> wow
[0:16:54] <$Sphincter_Spelunker> she has spares
[0:16:54] <+blastyoboots> What about a REAL PRESCRIPTION
[0:16:54] <+RandyFistburgers> get an expensive pair so you actually give a shit about them
[0:16:55] <+McSoliace> oh nvm
[0:16:55] <%HBTWarrior> ...holy shit paige
[0:16:56] <+FingaLights> No
[0:16:56] <Psych_man13_13> 10 pairs to go immediately into the trash
[0:16:58] <david9593> KomodoHype
[0:17:00] <TheZearGuy> Wait what? What was the site?
[0:17:00] <illegal_characters> this is so depressing
[0:17:03] <%Bt_Robot> BITCH ARE YOU FOR REAL?
[0:17:04] <TheGrimmHuntsman> Paige will be like Geordi, constantly shouting "Who said that?".
[0:17:06] <+Wiley_boi> JFC! I've had my glasses for 4 years!
[0:17:07] <%maskofmichael> The Witches curse is so real
[0:17:08] <BlkFlameKami> LUL
[0:17:11] <boomstickery> you need them on a string round your neck
[0:17:11] <roarinlala> glue your glasses to your face
[0:17:12] <+OwlLightningMage> How do you lose so many while barely leaving the house
[0:17:12] <+PleasantLee> I've had 1 pair of £90 glasses for 5 years and they've survived being run over by a car
[0:17:14] <+realm_forge> EVERY STREAM FOR 5 HEARS
[0:17:17] <Dakuu75> lol
[0:17:19] <+RandyFistburgers> exactly
[0:17:20] <david9593> woof
[0:17:22] <conspros> Hi i wish i could stay but its too late for me so bye and have some fun
[0:17:23] <illegal_characters> PAT'S RIGHT PAT'S RIGHT
[0:17:23] <$DocMadfox> Buy a fucking glasses' case or something, what the fuck?
[0:17:24] <+FingaLights> She kills all that she does not love
[0:17:25] <scrumbotime> The first 8 are Practice Glasses
[0:17:28] <chai_wolf> I'm kinda glad I don't need glasses cause I've broken all my sunglasses. My current ones are ok but are scratched 🤣🤣
[0:17:29] <+Bailey__gaming> BUY 20 THIS TIME
[0:17:29] <$shurtal> Or LEARN TO NOT BREAK SHIT
[0:17:30] <%Ell1ot> do you need the glasses chain thing so you don't lose them?
[0:17:33] <blaggablag> So Paige lives on Item Scarcity mechanics for her glasses
[0:17:34] <ShichiNoBushi> Like Rude, when one pair breaks, she just pulls out another pair and puts it on.
[0:17:34] <$SirGO0SE> the ones you lost DESERVE to be lost
[0:17:35] <badbrokuma> to quote my wife... "You don't go anywhere!! How did you lose them?!?"
[0:17:36] <%Zeif00> That IS a good deal
[0:17:36] <$Sphincter_Spelunker> Chat is pointing out this bit has gone on for 5 years
[0:17:37] <AMajorTom> Keep some in a lockbox for emergencies only.
[0:17:38] <%TheWinged7> So this is where Pat buys 10, hides 8 and tells you he only bought 2
[0:17:39] <LVL1_Scumbag> Or lose all of them
[0:17:39] <aiutare47> Paige complete your sexy librarian cosplay and get the retaining things
[0:17:40] <%HBTWarrior> SUCH A WASTE
[0:17:40] <$Comradeiota> They're practically disposable
[0:17:41] <CyborgAV> Or you can just NOT LOSE YOUR GLASSES
[0:17:42] <Blank9> I've had one pair of glasses for like 9 years now
[0:17:44] <+strakillias> ITonight's stream is a charity stream to provide blind women in Montreal glasses?
[0:17:44] <%Alazull> JUGGLE THEM?
[0:17:45] <+AnthonyJMax> juggle to break them
[0:17:46] <xeros720> i see the problem here, she thinks she has more than 2
[0:17:48] <david9593> get a monocle.
[0:17:48] <BoxNavy> 11
[0:17:49] <+FackinCrazy> just like tape a broken pair together like a nerd
[0:17:50] <%BallerSwagBro9k> My mum been using the same pair for 15 years
[0:17:50] <%dekkitout> A house built on glasses will go missing
[0:17:51] <Psych_man13_13> Just do the laser at this point
[0:17:51] <Dakuu75> you probably DID try to juggle them at some point
[0:17:52] <Monkeyweed21> Pat buy 20 and tell her you bought 10
[0:17:52] <@MelBrooksKA> I have had my current pair of glasses for like 10 years...
[0:17:53] <Sunstalker> You could lose 9 pairs of glasses PogChamp
[0:17:54] <+patriotrenegade> @PeachSaliva I've never lost my glasses so buying 10 pairs of glasses seems unreasonable
[0:17:55] <%SegaDSi> Paige this sounds like pat talking about Fake currency
[0:17:55] <%Garthunox> What? So then you can lose the house!?
[0:17:56] <+AXL808> you can BE ANYTHING including reckless
[0:17:56] <GarbageQueenEllie> Honey, you got a big storm comin' (snap)
[0:17:59] <+zamatermort> Are you going to guess your prescription again?
[0:17:59] <%BallerSwagBro9k> SMART
[0:18:00] <Skatedeandre> thats actually a good idea
[0:18:00] <+Vaporox> paige why are you like this
[0:18:01] <+megaman_sentinel> is that a scrunchie
[0:18:01] <+shruke> Don't throw stones when you live in a house of glasses
[0:18:01] <$SirGO0SE> the EMERGENCY glasses
[0:18:02] <MileenaTheOni> Don't throw stones in a glasses house.
[0:18:02] <+Bailey__gaming> hide 1 pair
[0:18:02] <marvel877> Paige, at this point, get the laser surgery and buy fake glasses to keep up appearances.
[0:18:02] <boomstickery> the emergency pair
[0:18:04] <%ShaneWhite> Or Buy 1 pair and not lose or break the 1 LUL
[0:18:04] <%TDotGoat> Vision Guardian
[0:18:06] <BoxNavy> oh god...
[0:18:07] <+Kemmybelle> maybe give Pat a pair or two to keep hidden away in a drawer when you lose the rest.
[0:18:08] <Skatedeandre> ?????
[0:18:09] <+mecha_11> You can lose/break all of them
[0:18:10] <%LordSDB> @full_circle ty mate!
[0:18:11] <LVL1_Scumbag> why 12?
[0:18:11] <+RandyFistburgers> buy 11 pairs, throw the first 10 in a blender...
[0:18:12] <Coystick> Paige LOVES 12 year olds
[0:18:13] <%sydowoodo> i don't understand
[0:18:14] <%UvBenServed> psaGoblin
[0:18:15] <%Zeif00> No 13
[0:18:15] <+Wiley_boi> collect all seven dragon balls ya feel me?
[0:18:15] <%Skelegroove> It isn't 12 it is 11 and 1
[0:18:15] <Skatedeandre> Number fear?
[0:18:16] <%BallerSwagBro9k> psaGoblin psaGoblin psaGoblin psaGoblin psaGoblin psaGoblin
[0:18:17] <+Taisuru> 13
[0:18:17] <boomstickery> can she even look at you?
[0:18:18] <ShichiNoBushi> Make it a bakers' dozen.
[0:18:19] <Blank9> 13, baker's dozen
[0:18:21] <TheGrimmHuntsman> Send the 12th pair to Plague.
[0:18:22] <%vehementvadr> 12 is an even number
[0:18:23] <+realm_forge> Lock that shit in a vault
[0:18:25] <david9593> except be careful
[0:18:25] <+snorlaxbud> LUL
[0:18:26] <%Bt_Robot> THEN PAT WILL HAVE ONE AND PLAGUE WILL HAVE ONE.
[0:18:26] <NoHoldsBarredProductions> She's looking but she can't see you
[0:18:28] <BoxNavy> then get 13
[0:18:28] <$SirGO0SE> Baba is panic
[0:18:29] <%Ell1ot> oh no! math!
[0:18:29] <%Zeif00> Organization 13 Glasses
[0:18:30] <%TheWinged7> oh no math, P A N I K
[0:18:33] <%penitentpendant> The solution is obvious, buy 10 pairs of glasses. Keep 9 and give her only 1.
[0:18:33] <%Aztec50> Paige is a glasses raid boss that requires 2 tanks to juggle aggro
[0:18:34] <%maskofmichael> Math is not her strong suit
[0:18:34] <%firewhiskeys> firewhiskeys subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 7 months! Glad to see your lovely face again (but also big respect when you aren't vibing with the on-screen thing).
[0:18:34] <%JimmyRuss> Now she needs 13
[0:18:39] <%thejimjamz> Big and strong!
[0:18:39] <skrewarrior> just buy 13 pairs of glasses
[0:18:40] <$shurtal> 18 minutes in
[0:18:41] <Dakuu75> 11 is a failure of a number
[0:18:42] <Dhurkst> baba is P A N I K
[0:18:45] <boomstickery> or 10 and 2
[0:18:46] <BoxNavy> 10 is a good number
[0:18:46] <MileenaTheOni> Paige, that's perfect! If you buy 12, you won't ever break or lose even one for fear of 11!
[0:18:47] <%zeroarturia> big and strong Paige!
[0:18:48] <+snorlaxbud> & then buy 2 more later
[0:18:49] <$Sphincter_Spelunker> just hide 75% from her
[0:18:50] <%vehementvadr> just get seventy and pray
[0:18:50] <+patriotrenegade> you are very dependent on Pat and Eli
[0:18:51] <filialpails> WOOL
[0:18:53] <+FingaLights> 2 of them lasted
[0:18:54] <Monkeyweed21> give pat 2 glasses
[0:18:54] <+realm_forge> HOW DO YOU DRIVE?!
[0:18:55] <@SoFarFetched> There's one up paige's butt
[0:18:57] <@SoFarFetched> right now
[0:18:57] <+Breaknoon> PLAGUE
[0:18:58] <NoHoldsBarredProductions> Baba is neurotic
[0:18:58] <%SegaDSi> you can't look paige
[0:18:59] <+lazymoon1> @PeachSaliva Where do you get your glasses from, that you get them for $10 each?
[0:19:00] <Skatedeandre> 10 glasses in 3 years sounds kind of bad
[0:19:04] <marvel877> Strong independent woman who don't need no man, that's why she's with Pat.
[0:19:05] <AMajorTom> Actually take 2 and tell her you only took one.
[0:19:05] <+strakillias> or get 12 and give 2 to pat
[0:19:06] <Coystick> She stores a pair in the backyard for the winter
[0:19:06] <%dekkitout> tajWHY
[0:19:08] <ShichiNoBushi> How much of that time was on your last pair?
[0:19:10] <$SirGO0SE> PlagueOfGripes calls you on CB Radio ASMR
[0:19:10] <+RandyFistburgers> I've had glasses last for over a decade Paige. One pair..
[0:19:10] <Dakuu75> STOP LOL
[0:19:12] <%sydowoodo> paige logic

[0:19:21] <+Wiley_boi> @realm_forge good point. how does she drive?
[0:19:21] <+nigelwasthere> Why not 20 pairs?

[0:19:46] <%Ell1ot> wat? i thought you were the destroyer of doors
[0:19:47] <%Alazull> In the romantic Nippon
[0:19:48] <%Hobomancer> This is like listening to kids on the playground going "Nuh uh, I have a shield"
[0:19:48] <zipperdude33> PAIGE NO
[0:19:48] <seanaramicus> Is that why you have such bad luck?
[0:19:49] <+patriotrenegade> I REMEMBER THIS
[0:19:49] <$r0chelimit> That explains a lot actually
[0:19:50] <%ArtemisM822> Paige...
[0:19:51] <AMajorTom> Cocaine users tend to break many mirrors.
[0:19:52] <aiutare47> Actually cursed
[0:19:53] <TheGrimmHuntsman> It'll be like those nuts that have guns stashed everyone around their house, but with glasses under every table and chair.
[0:19:53] <Sunstalker> THE MIRRORS, THE DOORS, THE DRYERS, THE PAIGE
[0:19:56] <%sydowoodo> is paige a vampire?
[0:19:57] <%TheWinged7> So @PeachSaliva is cursed not only by a witch, but multiple mirrors
[0:20:01] <%Bt_Robot> DOES SHE HATE WOMEN SO MUCH THAT SHE CANNOT EVEN TOLEATE HER REFLECTION?
[0:20:01] <FallenAngelZelos> That explains so much
[0:20:01] <+KorieTheCoward> Somethings bothering Paige? Probably misses her old glasses.
[0:20:02] <%FaultyJawa> FaultyJawa subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 42 months! I randomly thought about you and Asterios doing the New Years Girl bit the other day and it made me belly laugh. Great to see you again, Paige. <3
[0:20:03] <%ThomasOfTroy> Oh yeah, we've heard this story
[0:20:05] <ShichiNoBushi> That explains everything. She's probably up to 56 years.

[1:02:24] <%aishman> aishman subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 15 months! So Paige, I told my GF about your salad-mole eating escapade and shit hit me back with how she ate oatmeal that was then revealed to be infested with SOMETHING. What is it about red-headed furries and eating just the most retched things?
[1:02:24] <Valdorick> "I'm a sexy Lich, with bones everwhere, and points in Bard so I can seduce other skeletons"

[1:29:05] <KaiserMario> @PeachSaliva Over here "Spotted cow" is when you eat vanilla ice cream with coke
[1:29:05] <+Carquar> You can only get New Glarus beers in Wisconsin. They tried selling it in Illinois but we took it away because they suck
[1:29:05] <%Bluwizard21> @PeachSaliva You and pat should check out Sakuna of Rice and Ruin, the farming simulator has me hooked more than the combat, and the combat is great
[1:29:06] <KillMyPast> Should the game category be changed?
[1:29:07] <illegal_characters> paige is ricotta because you poke her and she crumbles

[1:31:28] <+dalmek> Paige and Pat share the braincell, it's a tossup who has it on any given day
[1:31:30] <%Agami23> i wonder how paige would feel about mohrgs.
[1:31:30] <illegal_characters> i did that to a guy once then later he punched me in the gut so hard i doubled over
[1:31:31] <Senselessvirus> Paige would be a warlock and her eldritch patron would be a litch
[1:31:32] <+EpicBigchill> pennies
[1:31:32] <+aslfrasle> Fireball is the only spell you "really" need.

[1:34:11] <+burntbagels13> it was ok i played the whole thing with a friend
[1:34:11] <user_naim> Pat should DM
[1:34:12] <lionmanguy> It isn't infinite. The amount of actions you could possibly conceive of taking is way way bigger than the amount of actions that are in any way supported by the system
[1:34:12] <blastazoid00> Hi Elmo
[1:34:12] <alliedmastercompy> ELMO
[1:34:13] <%ThomasOfTroy> How does the coop work with making decisions?
[1:34:13] <@SoFarFetched> @Agami23 Pat had a moment of killing an NPC accidentally and asked the DM to just bring them back to life.
[1:34:13] <+EpicBigchill> Ruin other peoples stories? D&D is suppose to be for the players to do what they want, not listen to the DM spin their tale all session

[1:34:17] <laserbeaming> I'd get you SO killed.
[1:34:19] <%Too_Much_Nukie> I want to play Baldur's Gate 3 but I don't want to burn out on the game before it's even finished.

[2:41:09] <%TheWinged7> unlike pat, paige can tell the difference between purple and blue
[2:41:09] <+chiazam> SHE FIGURED IT OUT FASTER THAN REGGIE LMFAOOOOOOOOO
[2:41:10] <Dragon_Batman> I swear I could see the lightbulb shine when she remembered LUL
[2:41:10] <%baka_sugoi> took a while LUL
[2:41:10] <DedlokPM> PartyHat rooBonk
[2:41:11] <+Tucker0603> but it's a Mace though
[2:41:12] <%its_just_whatever_dude> sipsipDab sipsipDab sipsipDab
[2:41:12] <stormhawk9891> She's already doing better than Reggie at this kind of battle
[2:41:12] <vVAstrAVv> good job hammer indeed
[2:41:13] <+MisterAvry> Paige good at dark souls
[2:41:14] <vonmaultke> Good job Mace
[2:41:15] <+Solutha> fukin pinwheel ripoff
[2:41:15] <+Solid_Stro> Good job Hammer, you too Paige, you helped.
[2:41:18] <MileenaTheOni> Congrats. You can recognize colours.
[2:41:19] <RyuuAoi> Stronk
[2:41:20] <fritz_dacat> You did it
[2:41:21] <%Bt_Robot> GOOD JOB, YOU BEAT THE EASIEST BOSS IN THE GAME
[2:41:25] <+JenovasPuppet> Good job, M-hammer
[2:41:26] <%Gondab> yay Mace!
[2:41:27] <%dzmi13> first try
[2:41:27] <cosmicgoatee> and a demons souls reference too Pat
[2:41:30] <Dhurkst> pupils
[2:41:31] <JDRizzle316> YEP
[2:41:35] <user_naim> With the help of Pat and Hammer
[2:41:36] <$sumrand0> 100% easiest
[2:41:37] <udurbalanced> Show us the boy
[2:41:40] <+Jaysky> There is always a big hat
[2:41:41] <%ssjklyco> How has Paige manage to die 90% less without her glasses
[2:41:41] <Orenjevel> he was a nerd with a hat that blocked his vision
[2:41:41] <jorniev> AND SHE CRUSHED IT
[2:41:45] <KeiganOfAstora> He's not easy if you're colorblind
[2:41:47] <+chiazam> It took Reggie forever to figure out a similar trick
[2:41:48] <justinjones1989> Deacons still easier
[2:41:59] <j___a___c___k___> if you play as mage ,it must be hard
[2:41:59] <%penitentpendant> @ssjklyco She can't panic at what she can't see
[2:42:00] <+Jaysky> Deacons of the beef
[2:42:03] <$sumrand0> @keiganofastora neither are stop lights
[2:42:03] <EuropanLamprey> This is the second/third hardest boss on a Bow only run
[2:42:05] <%FacetiousAF> psaDogchamp psaGib
[2:42:06] <$Sphincter_Spelunker> Reggie is also playing his first souls game
[2:42:06] <DarkestDom> LUL
[2:42:08] <sosandstorm> curse rotted greatwood is pretty easy too
[2:42:09] <j___a___c___k___> it must be resistant to magic
[2:42:09] <udurbalanced> Zangief content is why I come here
[2:42:09] <+MisterAvry> You do good
[2:42:10] <%TheWinged7> good job hammer
[2:42:11] <%arcaderabbit48> Ironically, I've always foudn him the most difficult as a mage when his soul is the most useful to me
[2:42:12] <Dreigun> @KeiganOfAstora I'm just learning now that they're different colors apparently :(
[2:42:13] <+Dreadlord134> It’s quite awhile until the next boss huh?
[2:42:16] <Dragon_Batman> You pointed the hammer the right way, good jerb
[2:42:19] <cosmicgoatee> shadow clone bosses in a nutshell FiNd ME
[2:42:21] <%KeiganOfAstora> @sumrand0 For real, I'm colorblind. Blue and purple are not easy for me to tell apart
[2:42:22] <devanmuse> how much longer until she gets to Wolnir?
[2:42:23] <+MisterAvry> bang it out over the fall
[2:42:24] <@SoFarFetched> the takeaway from this for paige will be "no glasses makes me stronger!"
[2:42:24] <%TheWinged7> so playing blind is better for paige?
[2:42:28] <%AncelDeLambert> yeah, but Reggie's playing the super short one
[2:42:31] <%Hobomancer> You're going backwards
[2:42:31] <$Puhff> Paige is smelling her way to victory
[2:42:31] <%arcaderabbit48> Oh yeah, how is Reggie Souls going?
[2:42:31] <Coystick> As long as Peach can facefuck, she's fine
[2:42:32] <Orenjevel> this is paiges first souls game
[2:42:37] <%Skelegroove> Wolnir can be the easiest boss depending on the circumstances
[2:42:37] <LVL1_Scumbag> Paige is always playing her first souls game
[2:42:37] <+patriotrenegade> WHERE ARE YOU GOING
[2:42:38] <Harvy666> I had like 20 runs with my mage to kill this mofo :D
[2:42:38] <%CommanderSqueaks> Little did we know SIGHT was actually a debuff for Peach
[2:42:40] <%wydamn> @justinjones1989, I played through with the great wolf curved sword, and just mowed through deacons, those guys are chumps.
[2:42:40] <j___a___c___k___> this is probably a sub boss or something
[2:42:40] <MetroidSlayerP7> Reggie is a natural, but overthinks battles
[2:42:42] <$Sphincter_Spelunker> fucking turpentine
[2:42:42] <user_naim> @jaysky nice
[2:42:42] <glass_marcus> "Hands Off"
[2:42:43] <+patriotrenegade> HANDS OFF
[2:42:47] <SucroseEuphoria> paige has discovered that she does not fear what she does not see
[2:42:52] <Louie_Salmon> As hands off as possible
[2:42:55] <+Dunmarkh> he was justified
[2:42:57] <%KeiganOfAstora> That shit was front seat taking the wheel with one hand lol
[2:42:59] <%penitentpendant> Reggie is doing well, Woolie is at ANGRY GIRLFRIEND levels with Chat
[2:43:00] <Explodincatz> sit of Giefd
[2:43:05] <stormhawk9891> BEANDAD
[2:43:06] <wibbwobbler> nice
[2:43:07] <justinjones1989> Stream over....
[2:43:12] <+ChestMimik> "Hands off" meant he was going to cut off Reggie's hands and swap them with his own
[2:43:12] <%TheWinged7> a bean?
[2:43:12] <ergulor> how good is woolie as a guide? is he as directionally challenged as usual?
[2:43:13] <BoxNavy> a bean DansGame
[2:43:14] <CappuccinoGuil> Reggie is also so hard with himself too. He's playing it like it's a Platinum game FFS
[2:43:15] <user_naim> That shit was driver’s ed panic wheel
[2:43:15] <%wydamn> Pat you can't say shit about backseating when the beginning of this boss fight you said "Purple bad"
[2:43:19] <%Hobomancer> New friend to talk to
[2:43:19] <j___a___c___k___> I dont know why i think page kinda looks like the tall lady from resident evil
[2:43:27] <%Bluwizard21> @PeachSaliva Woolie handed Reggie the most broken build in Demon's souls and now the game is a cake walk
[2:43:28] <hussdogrob> I have watched those videos and I feel like Woolie is a much more active backseater than pat
[2:43:28] <+Espadadegusto> heyo paige, and pat.
[2:43:28] <$sumrand0> @keiganofastora could be worse, red-green colorblindness has a TOP of game + IRL problems
[2:43:30] <SucroseEuphoria> paige is really out here like a fucking anime character who puts on a blindfold or goes blind and suddenly gets a massive power boost
[2:43:34] <RyuuAoi> Woolie says too much and not enough
[2:43:46] <$sumrand0> TON
[2:43:51] <%KeiganOfAstora> I've got red-green too. Fuckin' sucks dude
[2:43:52] <%Gondab> he took away Regie's turpintine when the boss of the area was weak to fire.
[2:43:57] <%Hobomancer> If you put 1 point into intelligence the wizard man will talk to you
[2:43:58] <+ChestMimik> @SucroseEuphoria Paige is just ginger Arthur from Fire Force
[2:44:01] <TurtlesAndTentacles> @RyuuAoi agreed
[2:44:04] <SucroseEuphoria> oh my god
[2:44:16] <j___a___c___k___> that mace will pierce the heavens
[2:44:21] <+AbnormalVoid> Ledo's Great Hammer and Great Club are best for PvP
[2:44:25] <$sumrand0> @keiganofastora well sh*t...
[2:44:27] <Tampaoster> Ledo's is the best hammer
[2:44:29] <Tampaoster> ever
[2:44:41] <megaminimechamocha> OMG I just realized Paige hasn't gotten to the sexy area yet
[2:44:42] <$sumrand0> that sucks man
[2:44:43] <%KeiganOfAstora> Yea it's a bitch for games sometimes but real life is fine
[2:44:43] <Tampaoster> I loved smough's but ledo's make me love it more
[2:44:49] <+MisterAvry> Oh yeah, I've been using the big gargoyle torch from the city under the dungeon
[2:44:50] <%penitentpendant> @ergulor Woolie wanted to skip grass grinding. So he rushed Reggie through an area to get the regen ring. But instead of buying a blunt weapon, he had Reggie punch skeletons for over 2 hours.
[2:44:58] <CappuccinoGuil> Woolie keeps saying "this is not worth it" when Demon's Souls all enemies are hella weak to something. Storm Ruler can be POISONED LUL
[2:45:01] <+AbnormalVoid> Great Club has good range on its R2 Sweep
[2:45:02] <+MisterAvry> where yhorm is
[2:45:03] <MileenaTheOni> Spiked Mace has Bleed, though.
[2:45:20] <RyuuAoi> Fisting was the way doe.
[2:45:23] <badbrokuma> I also think the great club had a true combo as well right?
[2:45:23] <Teyaric> @penitentpendant This is a lie. Woolie pointed out that clubs are an option, and Reggie rejected it.
[2:45:37] <ergulor> @penitentpendant thanks for the answer, i expected that kind of stuff
[2:45:48] <%Jack_of_No_Trades> ITS MY FAVORITE OLD LADY ROAR
[2:45:52] <$shurtal> djibouti video?
[2:45:53] <%penitentpendant> @Teyaric He suggested it in a passive aggressive tone.
[2:45:54] <user_naim> Woolie still best coach

[2:46:40] <+ShinBojangles> Jaboody streams on twitch
[2:46:44] <%ElkRiverDog> My god Paige sounds like Beq Lugg
[2:46:55] <%penitentpendant> @ergulor Overall Woolie is doing fine, a bit stubborn but fine. He's mostly at war with consumables.
[2:46:55] <thatangryguyofde> Paige already did the killing of the women?
[2:46:59] <gnarly_memes_bro> Now Get Out of My House
[2:47:04] <AMajorTom> Jaboody are live now. Go follow.

[3:15:17] <Dragon_Batman> How would Pat not have it
[3:15:18] <2fcd_twitch> No, he should just be there all the time
[3:15:19] <dragonairbnb> No, he should be there
[3:15:19] <%Promessa_EX> he should be there
[3:15:22] <$Sphincter_Spelunker> but did you tho
[3:15:22] <+Mitchellsocks> Nah, he should be there from the start
[3:15:23] <gnarly_memes_bro> He absolutely should be there on your first visit
[3:15:23] <%vivaciouseff> huh, he should be there if you have it iirc
[3:15:25] <+patriotrenegade> He SHOULD be there when you get there idk
[3:15:26] <%Bt_Robot> WASN'T THAT WELL NICE LOOKING?
[3:15:30] <%Promessa_EX> are you signed in?
[3:15:30] <%CptCreampuff16> is she gonna do dlc or puss out?
[3:15:34] <SucroseEuphoria> I'm super certain I've seen the main menu and the dlc wasn't there
[3:15:35] <Emperor_Machinus> @SoFarFetched Like an old rusty door on bad hinges going back and ford?
[3:15:37] <2fcd_twitch> Double check?
[3:15:40] <%Bt_Robot> REMEMBER IT FOR MUCH LATER
[3:15:42] <Coystick> Holy shit good luck on Sister Fredo Peach
[3:15:45] <@SoFarFetched> pretty much
[3:15:47] <KaiserMario> Did Paige beat any Lords yet? I always come here after Legion and he's there...
[3:15:48] <+Mitchellsocks> Wait, did she not kick the ladder after getting the shield?
[3:15:48] <laserbeaming> is the Framerate unlocked in PS5?
[3:15:49] <%bettysharkface> Look at these long boys
[3:15:55] <Dragon_Batman> He doesn't have to re download the dlc by itself right?
[3:15:57] <+MisterAvry> nice
[3:15:58] <@SoFarFetched> oh no those two were fucking geefStahp
[3:16:00] <MrMatternot> If you have Ashes, he should be there now.
[3:16:00] <BoxNavy> those leech things are fucking gross
[3:16:01] <+MisterAvry> no torch needed
[3:16:03] <$Sphincter_Spelunker> no lord dead
[3:16:06] <%bettysharkface> Ewwwww
[3:16:11] <phantalime> you're playing on ps5 tho right? is it installed??
[3:16:12] <gnarly_memes_bro> @kaisermario legion has no effect on dlc availability
[3:16:15] <laserbeaming> @KaiserMario they didn't go into the Swamp, so no Undead Legion yet
[3:16:22] <%nichos7> @PeachSaliva Is it actually installed? If you deleted the game from your hard drive it might not have installed the DLC along with the base game
[3:16:28] <%AncelDeLambert> these guys were the WORST when I played Cinders faith build
[3:16:31] <%Bt_Robot> I HELP ANYTIME
[3:16:34] <$Sphincter_Spelunker> omg it's dusk. dusk is tree
[3:16:36] <%AncelDeLambert> stupid bleed fuckers being so FAST
[3:16:37] <@SoFarFetched> look at these fuck monsters
[3:16:38] <+logoth_> giant white zombie dong
[3:16:39] <%penitentpendant> Giant Help, Any Time
[3:16:39] <KaiserMario> hmm, Idk, the triggers inthese games can be weird sometimes
[3:16:41] <BoxNavy> does dlc not install with the base game?
[3:16:47] <+Dunmarkh> big blind
[3:16:54] <gnarly_memes_bro> I know because I have beaten the legion with freides greatscythe
[3:16:56] <Valentinius_Anodyne> He's helping :)
[3:17:01] <Dragon_Batman> That's the only thing I can think of Navy
[3:17:09] <Dragon_Batman> I don't know myself
[3:17:11] <%Bt_Robot> YOU CAN SEE HIM FROM HERE
[3:17:15] <heartlesshealer> I love how fucked up the shadows were when Paige was getting surprised upon
[3:17:15] <Coystick> She just sorta...rubs her way around the environment doesn't she?
[3:17:15] <vinceshamwowslap> I think I missed that item🤔
[3:17:17] <Cyphereous> They should quit to the main menu and see if the DLC is installed
[3:17:23] <Badgerconda_> He's not you, Paige
[3:17:27] <DedlokPM> @PeachSaliva Did you INSTALL the dlc when you downloaded the game?
[3:17:28] <BoxNavy> he helps anytime
[3:17:32] <Emperor_Machinus> This is what happens when you get the wiggly bone disease. skeleton tries to escape and hug others
[3:17:34] <Srthunda> you can see the here from the tower tho
[3:17:41] <koffeemancer> Does having the torch on your back count as being out? The leeches aren't sticking
[3:17:44] <Dragon_Batman> Either way she isn't ready for it
[3:17:50] <Cyphereous> Because there should have been a NPC there
[3:17:55] <SucroseEuphoria> go check the main menu
[3:17:55] <%penitentpendant> @koffeemancer Seems to be
[3:18:03] <MileenaTheOni> @koffeemancer Yes.
[3:18:06] <Maids4lyfe> no the NPC does not show up until the doors are opened
[3:18:06] <BoxNavy> either way its not important now
[3:18:11] <DedlokPM> @PeachSaliva Because it is a seperate download from the game on consoles?
[3:18:11] <2fcd_twitch> No shame in double checking
[3:18:16] <gnarly_memes_bro> That is not true at all
[3:18:17] <%Bt_Robot> GO DOWN THE LADDER FOR BIG POWER
[3:18:19] <koffeemancer> Weird I never knew
[3:18:22] <%Promessa_EX> do you have Goty edition or did you buy seperate? cuz then you would need to install
[3:18:23] <Sunstalker> Did you have to reinstall the game at one point and it's not the complete edition? as in you bought the dlc later.
[3:18:25] <KaiserMario> It's not like they try the DLC now... I mean, it's late game stuff...
[3:18:27] <+dashdodger> pat has the patience of a saint
[3:18:34] <gnarly_memes_bro> Every time I've played gael has been there from the beginning
[3:18:34] <%KeiganOfAstora> HOLY SHIT
[3:18:39] <BoxNavy> chat its not important now they can figure it out later
[3:18:41] <Dragon_Batman> I don't know but I have a feeling it's like Bloodborne and you can't reach the dlc till hitting a certain point
[3:18:43] <%KeiganOfAstora> Do you remember 5 minutes ago?
[3:18:59] <vinceshamwowslap> I ran past all this shit PogChamp

[3:38:30] <BoxNavy> IGOTTAGO jermaDafoe
[3:38:33] <%penitentpendant> I don't know if she should buy the Key before she meets the Friendly NPC in this area

[3:39:01] <%KeiganOfAstora> Yea yea do the tower key
[3:39:02] <Monkeyweed21> dont get key until after this zone
[3:39:03] <peachy996> Beyonce still teaches people about BloodStarved Beast to this day
[3:39:05] <%vivaciouseff> can find some eyes on the inside with it
[3:39:06] <gnarly_memes_bro> @penitentpendant maybe its just me but I can never get him to show up in the cathedral
[3:39:07] <%KeiganOfAstora> Get some good shit from that
[3:39:16] <$Puhff> Keyngdom Hearts
[3:39:19] <heartlesshealer> let pat check
[3:39:20] <%Bt_Robot> DON'T DO KEY, THERE IS ANOTHER THREE ITEMS TO BUY FIRST
[3:39:23] <TurtlesAndTentacles> why would you ruin a soulful song...
[3:39:25] <Monkeyweed21> will break best boy quest
[3:39:28] <%Bt_Robot> SECRET
[3:39:30] <Cyphereous> Yeah, wait on the key for about one more boss
[3:39:31] <%penitentpendant> @gnarly_memes_bro You can accidentally skip him if you get up in the rafters before meeting him down below
[3:39:32] <%KeiganOfAstora> @Bt_Robot like what?
[3:39:34] <%Ranryu692> Ranryu692 subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 16 months! Your story about tricking Pat with the hand in front of the face thing reminded me of the time that I found out my teenaged cousins had never heard of 52 pickup. I will never forget the look on their faces as they tried to process what had just happened
[3:39:36] <MileenaTheOni> The key can get her more twinkling, though.
[3:39:40] <%SucroseEuphoria> I have never once had Best Boy's quest function correctly
[3:39:40] <+Grimlockfly> no it won't
[3:39:41] <%penitentpendant> She can still buy the key now
[3:39:43] <%Skelegroove> NPC Questlines are nonsense in this game
[3:39:49] <Spydurman> estus upgrade!
[3:39:49] <%penitentpendant> And just use the key later
[3:39:51] <%Bt_Robot> SECRET MAN IN WELL
[3:39:54] <$Sphincter_Spelunker> rear ahead 😳
[3:39:54] <%Skelegroove> The order of events is ridiculously convoluted

[3:39:57] <Tampaoster> Buy the hat
[3:40:01] <Tampaoster> hat
[3:40:01] <%king_wragles> @PeachSaliva buy the hat!
[3:40:02] <syanvpg> i got the key first and it did not break the quest
[3:40:02] <heartlesshealer> Wellman? Hat?????

[3:40:21] <Tampaoster> not anymore
[3:40:21] <%SucroseEuphoria> BIG hat?
[3:40:22] <Valentinius_Anodyne> The flow of questlines is convoluted in Lothric
[3:40:24] <Tampaoster> hat is 10k
[3:40:25] <%Bt_Robot> @KeiganOfAstora NO FOR LONG...
[3:40:27] <peachy996> She hasn't met that other guy yet
[3:40:30] <gnarly_memes_bro> @penitentpendant does going up to the part of the shrine where the silver serpent ring is cut toward that? cause that would explain why its ways broken for me
[3:40:34] <BoxNavy> 10000
[3:40:44] <corepercentlives> best hat
[3:40:44] <BoxNavy> no
[3:40:46] <Coystick> Clipping REEEEEEEEEEEE
[3:40:48] <Tampaoster> yes
[3:40:49] <+shabop> its great
[3:40:49] <%king_wragles> BUT IT'S RAD AS FUCK
[3:40:50] <+CSNG> Good for fashion souls
[3:40:51] <Dragon_Batman> You can just kill a few things
[3:40:51] <Tampaoster> it is
[3:40:53] <%Promessa_EX> style souls mfer
[3:40:55] <laserbeaming> BUT IT'S HUGE
[3:40:56] <%wydamn> It's called a big hat because it is big
[3:40:56] <Tampaoster> dont listen to pat
[3:40:57] <%vivaciouseff> it's a really stylish hat tho
[3:40:58] <heartlesshealer> You'll closer to ALCINA with hat!

[3:41:06] <wibbwobbler> not enough wow
[3:41:08] <ECRead> HE'S CORRECT
[3:41:09] <%penitentpendant> @gnarly_memes_bro Nope, the rafters in the Cathedral is what skips him. You can faff about early in Firelink and he should still spawn.
[3:41:09] <%Bt_Robot> BUT YOU'LL BUY 35000 SOUL BOOTS
[3:41:10] <%octavian_wolf> you hate him cuz he is right!
[3:41:10] <KaiserMario> @PeachSaliva aren't you upgrading the mace?
[3:41:11] <vinceshamwowslap> he’s right
[3:41:12] <Sunstalker> Why big hat when Pat like little hat?
[3:41:12] <%SucroseEuphoria> new souls-to-USD exchange rate lore just dropped
[3:41:13] <SirFancySwank> fashion souls is best souls
[3:41:13] <$Sphincter_Spelunker> cuz it poo
[3:41:17] <ECRead> no
[3:41:18] <peachy996> lol
[3:41:18] <MetroidSlayerP7> don't need armor if you never get hit 💡
[3:41:18] <linSP> ds3 is stinky
[3:41:18] <BoxNavy> no
[3:41:19] <+Whiskey_T_Foxtrot> DARK SOULS? MORE LIKE DORK SOULS #hahagottem
[3:41:20] <twistedj3ster> because DS3 is bad
[3:41:21] <TheEndlessRiver1> Eli has bad taste ds3 is the best, but i do respect the "Cuz fuck it"
[3:41:21] <Melchior_the_Wise> no
[3:41:22] <%wydamn> It's called a big hat because big hat logan wore it
[3:41:23] <jorniev> CUZ he is an ass
[3:41:27] <SwindlerOfProgress> LUL
[3:41:27] <SirFancySwank> DS3 hurt him
[3:41:28] <Piiavc> hes right, armour stats dont really do a lot for PVE, as long as you have something in the armour slot your good
[3:41:30] <Dragon_Batman> That's a good point LUL
[3:41:31] <DianaTheAscian> it doesn't have feelings paige
[3:41:33] <+Undenizen> He hates dark souls :3 I've never heard him say a single nice thing about it
[3:41:34] <%KeiganOfAstora> Oh don't be so fucing petty Eli
[3:41:37] <+askalta> the charged r2s cant hurt you eli
[3:41:38] <%spitelite> hes plague of gripes not plague of compliments
[3:41:39] <+Undenizen> I listened to that entire series he did once
[3:41:41] <peachy996> I remember your nice things plague. But also fuck it
[3:41:42] <Dhurkst> Because he's a "realist"
[3:41:42] <Dia_Dar> DS3 touched him in bad places
[3:41:45] <Samex_Comex> Dark souls 3 more like dark souls pee
[3:41:45] <Sunstalker> Eli likes the big tiddy slug lady
[3:41:48] <dizimous> This ones my fav tbh
[3:41:48] <%SucroseEuphoria> he's said a few nice things about it to be fair
[3:41:51] <+JusTTheGuyYouNeed> you dont do it because is good, you do it for the fashion
[3:41:53] <%maskofmichael> Plague, if you hate the game then why do you know so much about it?
[3:42:06] <%penitentpendant> @maskofmichael Spite is a powerful thing
[3:42:06] <%AmanisHouseOfNonsense> I actually never heard what Eli's opinion on DS3 was
[3:42:07] <Dragon_Batman> Oooh god yea
[3:42:15] <Monkeyweed21> Eli is just being enlightened centrist a little
[3:42:22] <anAngryHamster> Dark Souls 3 somehow has the worst qualities of both its predecessors along with a host of its own problems
[3:42:24] <$Sphincter_Spelunker> I think something else ruined MAGfest tbh
[3:42:33] <Dragon_Batman> Hah
[3:42:34] <+TreeeFOX> DaS3 is the second best game in the series. and it waaay worse that DaS1

[3:43:51] <st_jimmy456> "I like faking this" - Eli 2021
[3:43:52] <+BigDumBeak> ladders are up to something...
[3:43:53] <laserbeaming> if Paige doesn't look both ways before crossing a street, just yell "LADDER" and she'll do a 360

[3:44:20] <Valentinius_Anodyne> I think Dark Souls 3 is okay, but it definitely leans on DS1 nostalgia at times

[3:44:27] <+TreeeFOX> "a-hole" *Ellie nuts
[3:44:28] <%AncelDeLambert> Octopath got boring real fast

[3:44:36] <RushUnplugged> whoa Arcadum wrote on twitter about running D&D for Paige
[3:44:37] <Monkeyweed21> the squirrel enemy has a move called "These Nuts" @PeachSaliva

[3:48:09] <Dragon_Batman> Yea honestly doing this fresh might be the best call
[3:48:11] <@commanderclaw> Paige with sword and shield: only attack. Paige with hammer: be cautious
[3:48:16] <heartlesshealer> yeah lots of progress

[3:48:20] <Shadope342> thank you entertainment lady

[3:48:25] <@SoFarFetched> us people
[3:48:27] <heartlesshealer> Thanks for hosting! <3
[3:48:29] <$CrowbarFacelift> we're all the crap
[3:48:29] <%dekkitout> You people? tajRLY
[3:48:30] <ahaegotrigger> alright have a wonderful night
[3:48:30] <JDRizzle316> ME PEOPLE?
[3:48:35] <Arrior_Septem> arcadum offered to run a game of dnd for paige
[3:48:37] <Dragon_Batman> It really is
[3:48:39] <Hydrapissed> FeelsGoodMan
[3:48:43] <+TreeeFOX> "have we made the monies? okay. time to stop"
[3:48:44] <johnakachoobie> Have day. Doin a preesh.
[3:48:44] <Dhurkst> omg it's so true
[3:48:45] <bleugh> wtf it's been almost 4 hours
[3:48:45] <rosemon5001> has she really not open the door?
[3:48:47] <$Sphincter_Spelunker> roll with shield, block with two hand weapon
[3:48:48] <heartlesshealer> IT IS ABSOLUTELY LIKE THAT
[3:48:50] <gnarly_memes_bro> bloodborne was the weirdest one for sure
[3:48:55] <peachy996> I'm terrified to see what you do with a skill weapon
[3:48:59] <linSP> paige is always opposite
[3:49:01] <gronzen> She really does and it's fucking nuts
[3:49:07] <%BinaryFireball> it's the visible aspect of it. she see shield, she feel safe
[3:49:08] <Dragon_Batman> I think it's the appearance of the shield
[3:49:09] <@Jekado> is there a mod to make it LOOK like paige has a shield and sword but attacks like a GIANT CLUB
[3:49:10] <%Bluwizard21> @PeachSaliva Pat, it's because she feels safe with a shield even if she doesnt use it
[3:49:11] <%penitentpendant> The shield gives her the confidence to attack. The lack of shield makes her fear reprisal.
[3:49:12] <MetroidSlayerP7> attack speed for sure
[3:49:12] <Dhurkst> makes sense
[3:49:14] <gnarly_memes_bro> the sad part is I do the same thing myself
[3:49:18] <@SoFarFetched> Is Paige just those dogs that are all bark and no bite when there's a fence in front of them,but as soon as the fence is down they just stop barking.
[3:49:21] <SwindlerOfProgress> Probably correct
[3:49:23] <$CrowbarFacelift> b e a g g r e s s i v e
[3:49:27] <+JenovasPuppet> So dual wield small weapons?
[3:49:27] <%AncelDeLambert> ... why are we in ugly screen?
[3:49:31] <coreyyotto> long swords are fucking busted in DS3 though so you can just o that
[3:49:31] <%Promessa_EX> maybe the longsword playstyle would be better
[3:49:33] <Laecerelius> She ignores the shield and blocks with her weapon instead while she loves dodging when she has a fat roll
[3:49:34] <BoxNavy> no
[3:49:34] <%Promessa_EX> but whatever
[3:49:34] <+king_wragles> Wait, is the stream over?
[3:49:34] <%MisterRockett> She needs a fast big weapon and a slow small weapon.
[3:49:35] <%Ranryu692> the weapon sets the pace
[3:49:35] <+Whiskey_T_Foxtrot> when's PeachSpace9?
[3:49:39] <a_mad_dragon_> go fight go fight go fight
[3:49:39] <+Dunmarkh> have her use a dex build then

[3:50:00] <Hydrapissed> monkaS
[3:50:01] <EuropanLamprey> Exile Greatsword?
[3:50:01] <Dazko_> There is a ring that hides your weapon right?
[3:50:02] <2fcd_twitch> Greatsword
[3:50:04] <%penitentpendant> But that would have low durability?
[3:50:04] <Piiavc> Greatlance has poise in ds3
[3:50:04] <2fcd_twitch> ?
[3:50:06] <@SoFarFetched> Isn't that up to Eli

[3:50:53] <%TheWinged7> Eli wins by a landslide
[3:50:55] <Dragon_Batman> No it has to be Eli drunk or something
[3:50:56] <+JenovasPuppet> Have Plague draw something and then Paige signs her name on it.
[3:50:57] <%Bt_Robot> PLAGUE HAS TO DRAW BLINDFOLDED
