[0:05:45] <%ChrisPlaysThing> @Brassnarwhal all good, I found it Metal Crusher / Death by Glamour ▸ Holder Remix
[0:06:00] <%NoHoldsBarredProductions> Predictions: will we see Vtuber Paige, fleshtuber Paige, or no Paige at all? Will the Paige truly be the friends we made along the way?
[0:06:01] <Sikkab> PEACH STREAM WITH adumBooty AGAIN <3
[0:06:11] <%Brassnarwhal> @sirrice77 the source of the song, I'm certain it's a death by glamour remix or cover but idk who's
[0:06:12] <%Ranryu692> welcome raiders!
[0:06:28] <%Brassnarwhal> oh well chris found it, excellent
[0:06:51] <%Dakuu75> Had such a bad day, spent literally 5 hours troubleshooting why my PC was making noise. Found out it wasn't a fan, it was the Aoi cooling unit.
[0:06:55] <%Dakuu75> (I need this stream)
[0:07:06] <%ChrisPlaysThing> from 8 years of QA, my google fu has grown strong
[0:07:11] <%Ranryu692> @NoHoldsBarredProductions her PC can't handle the Vtuber and Elden Ring at the same time lol
[0:07:18] <%NoHoldsBarredProductions> Glad you're here, Dakuu!
[0:07:32] <%Brassnarwhal> @chrisplaysthing it's a good skill

[0:12:30] <$hewlettfan96> I dont think so
[0:12:30] <%DJLavender> I predict that Paige will trip over a rock into a ravine and land on the endgame boss thus killing it.

[0:12:40] <$hewlettfan96> You sound jizzed
[0:12:45] <%Sotetsu> Monster and Adderall need to team up.
[0:12:47] <frvicorn> the period comes out
[0:12:49] <Pokakaa> Caffeine
[0:12:49] <@CreepyPorpoise> creepy49Sip
[0:12:50] <Pokakaa> is a drug

[0:12:59] <Pokakaa> OH
[0:13:01] <Pokakaa> OH GOD
[0:13:07] <$hewlettfan96> Coffee is like cocaine
[0:13:11] <frvicorn> very dangerous creatures
[0:13:15] <%Sotetsu> They look like alien fingers.
[0:13:17] <@MelBrooksKA> @PeachSaliva Caffeine is by definition a drug
[0:13:17] <secret_npc> dark brotherhood
[0:13:19] <%cade_calrayn> Dark Brotherhood
[0:13:19] <@CreepyPorpoise> Oh the fingers even sits in a chair
[0:13:20] <Pokakaa> I have not gotten that far, I thought it was the Dark Souls 3 fingers
[0:13:22] <%NoHoldsBarredProductions> Dark Brotherhood
[0:13:23] <sirrice77> dank brotherhood
[0:13:23] <$hewlettfan96> Ughhh
[0:13:24] <drawie_holly> i thought for sure it was just a name
[0:13:26] <coffeeabomination> You would not believe your eyes
[0:13:27] <%Brassnarwhal> dark brootherhood
[0:13:29] <+DamnFineCupofStreaming> the dark brotherhood
[0:13:30] <$hewlettfan96> Asses creed
[0:13:36] <Pokakaa> IT'S FUCKIN FINGERS HOLY S
[0:13:38] <$hewlettfan96> Enter the anus
[0:13:38] <frvicorn> my coffee is like mild cocaine
[0:13:39] <%Ranryu692> I thought it was going to be two people
[0:13:41] <drawie_holly> but they're actually two fingers
[0:13:44] <%Sotetsu> The Dark Fingerhood
[0:13:46] <frvicorn> strong
[0:13:49] <%Brassnarwhal> nah just fingies
[0:13:53] <%NoHoldsBarredProductions> Y'know they call 'em fingers, but I've never seen 'em fing.
[0:13:57] <Pokakaa> I'm so glad I showed up to this stream sober.
[0:13:58] <%Sotetsu> Enia
[0:14:01] <$hewlettfan96> Like the assassins creed games
[0:14:05] <%NoHoldsBarredProductions> Oh, there they go
[0:14:08] <$hewlettfan96> She’s great
[0:14:11] <Pokakaa> This would have been bad-trip city.
[0:14:19] <%Sotetsu> Duplication seems to be rare.
[0:14:19] <%NoHoldsBarredProductions> Hey Pat
[0:14:20] <%Dakuu75> well.. the question is, do you want two of those? or one of each?
[0:14:25] <%ChrisPlaysThing> I'm now expecting you to have to fight those ThumbThumb robots from Spy Kids
[0:14:28] <%Sotetsu> Hi, Pat!
[0:14:37] <rottingpastry> it's not that many souls
[0:14:41] <+RedMaskBandit> Astrid?
[0:14:42] <%cade_calrayn> Duplication ensures that you can get both items from the boss soul
[0:14:46] <ebrion> Finger hood of the traveling knuckles
[0:14:52] <$hewlettfan96> Eat em
[0:14:52] <%Dakuu75> I ate' um. I didn't want either of those weapons
[0:14:54] <sirrice77> No consequence for duping just that you use up the place that does it, each place that can do it
[0:15:11] <%Brassnarwhal> yes you can, if you want both items do it if you don't don't
[0:15:17] <Pokakaa> Would any of you have laughed if she went in there and it was literally just Astrid in the studded black and red armor? lmao
[0:15:22] <%Sotetsu> A doubleheader
[0:15:29] <Danitaras> smug paige is smug
[0:15:30] <%Brassnarwhal> dragon is faith paige
[0:15:33] <%Ranryu692> @PeachSaliva you gave a scroll to the Incantation vendor but you never checked what the new spells were
[0:15:41] <tanarath> Just wait, no cost on waiting
[0:15:44] <+adamisbarely3d> did paige get her controller foibles fixed?
[0:15:45] <Pokakaa> I wish there was werewolves in this game.
[0:15:46] <%Dakuu75> you can jsut throw that soul in storage, and think about it later
[0:15:49] <Pokakaa> And vampires.
[0:16:01] <%Sotetsu> Thanks, Pat
[0:16:04] <frvicorn> come to Norway
[0:16:14] <tanarath> oh, your gold controller is working? nice.
[0:16:21] <tanarath> Faith is USEFUL
[0:16:22] <Pokakaa> I hope Elden Ring becomes Elden Scrolls
[0:16:24] <frvicorn> got metallic blue dragonflies here
[0:16:29] <tanarath> cures are super good
[0:16:29] <%Dakuu75> I think about 12-17 faith let's you use most things. (at least for the ailment cures)
[0:16:31] <%Sotetsu> The item to cure poison is pretty easy to make
[0:16:34] <frvicorn> they are pretty
[0:16:36] <Pokakaa> I really want a series of games like this.
[0:16:36] <%Brassnarwhal> where is the book for the black flames? i found 3 other books no black fire
[0:16:37] <+barrakuta371> I started out as Samurai and now I'm dabbling a bit in Flintstone sorcery
[0:16:49] <tanarath> 12-17 at most... oh yeah, there's crafting
[0:16:53] <Spydurman> magic is really useful, the game lets you go for Strength/Faith builds. It's kinda what Pat did
[0:16:57] <sirrice77> you need to find the recipe first
[0:16:59] <rottingpastry> neutralizing boluses
[0:17:01] <tanarath> Pat wont craft for some reason.
[0:17:02] <%Sotetsu> I don't remember where I got the recipe
[0:17:03] <Pokakaa> I love this game because its world feels like Morrowind, which was literally the best elder scrolls setting.
[0:17:03] <%Dakuu75> you need to find the cookbooks to make more stuff
[0:17:08] <%cade_calrayn> @PeachSaliva you *will* want to get at least 12 Faith for the cleanse one because the Scarlet Rot cleanse items are very difficult to craft
[0:17:20] <%cade_calrayn> the items needed are limited
[0:17:31] <%Brassnarwhal> @cade_calrayn those blossoms are hell to get
[0:17:33] <%Sotetsu> Paige, you are so transparent, we can't even see you.
[0:17:34] <Pokakaa> "I'm not expecting too many people" 196
[0:17:37] <tanarath> Paige, it's fine
[0:17:43] <+Proxzo> Do you have to read cookbooks to learn them?
[0:17:43] <+tetraes> Jokes on u ill watch both
[0:17:46] <%Dakuu75> yeah, jesus christ. Pat, Paige AND Woolie were streaming this the other night and I only have 2 monitors. fuck. XD
[0:17:49] <bassoontyphoon> Hi Paige hi everyone!
[0:17:53] <Pixel_Butts> pat stinks
[0:17:54] <secret_npc> I have to choose parents
[0:17:59] <%Ranryu692> Pat is WAY too far ahead of me, I can't watch his streams anymore lol
[0:18:06] <%Brassnarwhal> if you guys weren't running at the same time i would watch both but my phone doesnt have dual monitors
[0:18:06] <+Gamblor69> My monitor is big enough for both of you :)
[0:18:07] <Pokakaa> I love how many sites of grace she has, because I don't care to look for them.
[0:18:08] <@CreepyPorpoise> Yeah but you're my favorite uwu
[0:18:08] <%thejimjamz> thejimjamz subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 28 months, currently on a 23 month streak! Waffle gang rise up
[0:18:11] <Danitaras> you and Pat co-op this when? xD
[0:18:14] <%Sotetsu> Pat is too far ahead for me, too.
[0:18:14] <Spydurman> y'all should squad stream Elden Ring for funsies
[0:18:17] <Pokakaa> I also can't watch pat because he's too far ahead.
[0:18:19] <%Brassnarwhal> I'll be back for the vods
[0:18:26] <Pokakaa> You're ALMOST too far ahead for me.
[0:18:28] <%Dakuu75> yeah, true. Pat is light years ahead of where I wanna watch atm
[0:18:44] <tanarath> @dakuu75 open multiple windows, disable their fullscreen, and shape the windows on top of eachother
[0:18:49] <Pokakaa> A month of WHAT
[0:18:53] <secret_npc> very important
[0:19:02] <+RedMaskBandit> I was watching Pat just because how far ahead he was but when he just eclipsed me I just rather hang here.
[0:19:05] <%wizard_of_diamonds> Oh boy, fucked Dr visits. Always a good story
[0:19:10] <%Sotetsu> Vagoos
[0:19:11] <tanarath> creepy49EEK creepy49EEK
[0:19:12] <%Dakuu75> !
[0:19:16] <+KingpinLarry> I don't even know where you are story wise. I bet Goldrick 4 days ago and I've just been exploring.
[0:19:43] <frvicorn> I promise to be back. I just wanted to come in here and say *yay you peach*  you're the best!!!
[0:19:48] <+stickygumbolee> to quote a great man, waffles are just pancakes with a syrup trap
[0:19:50] <%Dakuu75> "Do you like waffles? Yeah we like waffles~" ♪♪ (christ I'm old)
[0:19:51] <tanarath> I think both have their merits.
[0:19:53] <%thejimjamz> I respect your preferences until you call out crepes
[0:19:53] <drawertogether> This game is massive
[0:20:02] <vance168> A waffle house is a waffle house but that house of Pancakes is INTERNATIONAL
[0:20:04] <frvicorn> from Norway
[0:20:11] <frvicorn> trust me you are
[0:20:20] <%Ranryu692> Pancakes are so much better than waffles
[0:20:20] <secret_npc> gotta go pancakes
[0:20:21] <frvicorn> 🍿🤩🤩
[0:20:23] <@CreepyPorpoise> I want pancakes
[0:20:26] <@CreepyPorpoise> maybe tomorrow
[0:20:27] <%Brassnarwhal> i wish pat could read messages that were misspelled as well as you do peach he usually just gives up if i fat thumb
[0:20:29] <%Sotetsu> Pancakes soak up syrup too fast.
[0:20:32] <secret_npc> the pocket thing is dumb SORRY
[0:20:34] <%ChrisPlaysThing> What a bout French Toast?
[0:20:34] <%Dakuu75> I think it depends if you want the crunch of a waffle or the soft cake
[0:20:40] <+ReallyBigRocks> Pancakes are too spongey imo
[0:20:40] <%Ranryu692> also you can put fruit or chocolate chips into a pancake
[0:20:43] <bassoontyphoon> Paige may not be the best, but she has the most determination
[0:20:47] <%Sotetsu> Pickles
[0:20:47] <@CreepyPorpoise> they are, I love a plate of fluffy pancakes
[0:20:48] <+KingpinLarry> but you can't drink the syrup from a pancake
[0:20:48] <MaritimeSpanker> Both are great with whipped cream and strawberry jam
[0:20:49] <Omenaire_> waffles are superior to pancakes
[0:20:55] <sporeian94> Paige... have you been huggin Fai again?
[0:20:55] <ergulor> eh they tend to become insipid once they soak the syrup
[0:21:01] <ergulor> dunno why
[0:21:03] <secret_npc> cool
[0:21:03] <%Brassnarwhal> gotta make your own waaffles any other option is subpar
[0:21:04] <MaritimeSpanker> unless you're doing thick pancakes, then you eat that with a side of bacon and lingonberries
[0:21:06] <thegoldenhole> I will watch this on the vod later. love you Paige!
[0:21:10] <+HaloIsA> Pancakes soak in syrup too well and it just isnt as good as loose syrup on a waffle
[0:21:12] <tanarath> Waffles have the grid to contain syrup + it soaks in, my condolences for bad waffle experiences.
[0:21:12] <%wizard_of_diamonds> I would prefer a mediocre waffle to a mediocre pancake, but I'd prefer a good pancake to a good waffle
[0:21:21] <%Sotetsu> Try the chocolate chip and peanut butter diet!
[0:21:26] <+RedMaskBandit> but when it's too soggy, it's not great
[0:21:32] <+barrakuta371> I prefer pancakes but hearing the phrase " You waffle hating bastard" is hilarious to me
[0:21:34] <Pokakaa> That's patches!
[0:21:35] <%vivaciouseff> it's the nicest man!
[0:21:37] <secret_npc> what the fuck
[0:21:37] <Pokakaa> omfg
[0:21:42] <Pokakaa> Same voice actor too...
[0:21:42] <+DamnFineCupofStreaming> The patchy boi
[0:21:44] <sporeian94> PATCHES GET THE FUCK OUTTA HERE
[0:21:46] <%Sotetsu> @secret_npc LUL
[0:21:46] <@CreepyPorpoise> wow
[0:21:57] <+emVulpine> Welcome to Patches Island.
[0:22:18] <Pokakaa> I like to think there's just a dude who voices patches that just sits in his home alone waiting for the next Fromsoft announcement.
[0:22:30] <tanarath> Patches being a nice guy for once
[0:22:54] <bassoontyphoon> (X )  DOUBT
[0:22:56] <%wizard_of_diamonds> Thanks Patches.
[0:22:56] <%Ranryu692> the Iron Virgins is what they called the robotics team at my high school
[0:22:59] <Pokakaa> Patches is the outlaw Dutch never made part of the Van Der Lind gang.
[0:23:12] <lyzejag> ... Is it real
[0:23:23] <+RedMaskBandit> @ranryu692 sounds like a dope Battle Bots team.
[0:23:23] <Pokakaa> Why would it be
[0:23:25] <+KingpinLarry> I wish I was a virgin
[0:23:27] <Willowight> sounds so fake
[0:23:29] <%Brassnarwhal> x
[0:23:52] <%cade_calrayn> It points the way
[0:23:53] <Danitaras> read your cookbooks
[0:23:53] <%MisterRockett> Did he just tell you a contraption filled with spinning scyths will throw you really far?
[0:23:58] <Pokakaa> Its probably an item that shows you where a site is
[0:24:03] <%Ranryu692> there's a Grace right next to you
[0:24:06] <drawie_holly> had no idea he showed up there
[0:24:09] <Pokakaa> LOL
[0:24:11] <%Brassnarwhal> @misterrockett yes
[0:24:14] <+ReallyBigRocks> Patches handing out speedrun strats
[0:24:15] <drawie_holly> lmao
[0:24:21] <Pokakaa> Same
[0:24:28] <%MisterRockett> @Brassnarwhal You have to be some sort of idiot to believe that lol.
[0:24:38] <%Dakuu75> I love to hate, Patches.
[0:24:38] <%Ranryu692> do you love Patches more because his name starts with Pat-?
[0:24:40] <lyzejag> I NEVER found him again, and i just finished the game lmao
[0:24:48] <%Brassnarwhal> @misterrockett what do you mean why would pat hes lie to me?
[0:24:51] <+KingpinLarry> He leaves at some point and will tell you. Now I don't need ti figure out where he went.
[0:25:02] <sirrice77> @Brassnarwhal are you sure?
[0:25:07] <%Ranryu692> Northwest
[0:25:10] <lyzejag> I hope he's still here, thank you  !!
[0:25:21] <drawie_holly> i found him on a different place than this
[0:25:27] <secret_npc> follow the dude
[0:25:30] <%Brassnarwhal> @sirrice77 sure about what?
[0:25:32] <@CreepyPorpoise> You follow a little guy
[0:25:33] <oda_flobunaga> @PeachSaliva show you to a dungeon
[0:25:34] <%SveriSageAdvice> they show you to content playtesters missed
[0:25:35] <+ReallyBigRocks> they lead you to things
[0:25:36] <%cade_calrayn> Follow the phanto
[0:25:37] <+KingpinLarry> for upgrades i think
[0:25:42] <%vivaciouseff> you should be able to examine them
[0:25:42] <+ReallyBigRocks> interact with it
[0:25:48] <secret_npc> you can activate it but the message is in the way
[0:25:49] <%wizard_of_diamonds> @PeachSaliva If you click one, a ghost pops in and out of existance, shambling in a direction to a secret
[0:25:53] <@CreepyPorpoise> You interact and they leave footprints
[0:25:54] <+t3c4n0l0gy> gold feetsteps
[0:25:57] <%SveriSageAdvice> only if you havent done the dungeoon
[0:25:58] <+RedMaskBandit> it helps lead you to missable content.
[0:25:59] <Monkeyweed21> you already found the dungeon this leads to
[0:26:00] <%Dakuu75> if you can't interact with it, it's because you did it all ready
[0:26:00] <sirrice77> @Brassnarwhal oh i was replying to the guy that said you would have to be an idiot to believe patches
[0:26:04] <%Brassnarwhal> i found another patches interaction later on too
[0:26:04] <%strakillias> I think if you already did the thing it is linked to it doesn't work.
[0:26:06] <Mikers29> They lead you to something but I think if you already found it. it wont appear
[0:26:07] <%Ranryu692> how peculiar
[0:26:08] <secret_npc> message is covering it up
[0:26:12] <@CreepyPorpoise> Ah yeah, you already found the thing so its not interactable
[0:26:12] <%Brassnarwhal> @sirrice77 it happens
[0:26:19] <secret_npc> ohk
[0:26:23] <drawie_holly> i think it shows a secret but only works if you haven't found the secret yet
[0:26:38] <Monkeyweed21> it points you to the crystal cave with the snails
[0:26:40] <@CreepyPorpoise> Some of the things they show are more secret than others
[0:27:14] <+KingpinLarry> cartwheel of pain. lol
[0:27:15] <%Ranryu692> one led me to a big bear once
[0:27:26] <%Ranryu692> but not the fun kind of big bear :(
[0:27:34] <drawie_holly> woah what's this Bloodborne moveset
[0:27:34] <%Brassnarwhal> the game describes these guys as having dumpy frog heads, i love them
[0:27:46] <bassoontyphoon> @ranryu692 tfw no muscle bear husbando
[0:27:52] <Monkeyweed21> oh shit I never found this, neat
[0:28:02] <drawie_holly> i didn't find it eithe
[0:28:11] <drawie_holly> and i went all over this place
[0:28:17] <drawie_holly> djsjdjs
[0:28:18] <+KingpinLarry> of course. E=MC Hammer
[0:28:38] <sriracha_cream> Are we not telling her about the map fragments, chat?
[0:28:46] <Mister_McDerp> CRAWDADS
[0:29:01] <drawie_holly> yum yum
[0:29:03] <%Ranryu692> I snuck past these guys, and then fell off the stairs and woke them up LUL
[0:29:07] <%Brassnarwhal> @sriracha_cream the game tells you about the map fragments
[0:29:12] <urkleturtle> very
[0:29:20] <%linSP> pronz
[0:29:21] <+KingpinLarry> other than shrimp I'm not big on shellfish
[0:29:21] <%Brassnarwhal> yes
[0:29:23] <sriracha_cream> Yes BrassNarwhal but does PAIGE know how to find them??
[0:29:26] <Mister_McDerp> crustaceans are delicious
[0:29:27] <+Maleicus> go buy some boiled prawn from that one guy
[0:29:29] <Mister_McDerp> but gross looking
[0:29:31] <+Maleicus> down the way
[0:29:49] <%Brassnarwhal> @sriracha_cream only paige knows what paige knows I can't tell you that
[0:29:54] <Zeif00> Closests I'll come to eating the bugs
[0:29:55] <sriracha_cream> Lol word
[0:30:04] <%Brassnarwhal> @peachsaliva do you know how to find map fragments?
[0:30:21] <%SveriSageAdvice> ye
[0:30:22] <%Ranryu692> yes
[0:30:24] <drawie_holly> crawfish are hard to find
[0:30:25] <vance168> Yep!

[0:31:13] <udurbalanced> I have an interview next week for a job starting at $70k/year.  Wish me luck errybody
[0:31:19] <%Brassnarwhal> scarab above
[0:31:21] <bassoontyphoon> Paige goes to America and gets shot
[0:31:21] <djblue_shift> LA might not be amazing but at least we got boiling crab
[0:31:57] <+KingpinLarry> Where'd you get that skill?
[0:32:03] <%Brassnarwhal> @djblue_shift the worst part is that despite being coastal the crab probably ships from somewhere further north
[0:32:31] <+RedMaskBandit> smells like broke in here
[0:32:37] <Danitaras> I love shell fish but I had to cut back on them :(
[0:32:41] <bassoontyphoon> Do you like poutine?
[0:32:47] <%MisterRockett> Uh-oh looks like a huge nerd is trying to hemorrhage your viewers.
[0:32:59] <Ell1ot> a restaurant near me as $1 oysters on thursday
[0:33:02] <%Brassnarwhal> it's like a reverse raid
[0:33:09] <Omenaire_> whos pat?
[0:33:13] <vance168> Shrimp cocktail, appetizer of champions
[0:33:24] <Khester824> but I love paige more
[0:33:25] <Mister_McDerp> I don't want to choose jermaPluto
[0:33:38] <%Brassnarwhal> @omenaire_ joke or not joke
[0:33:38] <%Ranryu692> @Omenaire_ her fiancé, PatStaresAt
[0:33:40] <Spydurman> going deep vs going wide
[0:33:43] <+minimumeffortmaximumderp> I will be checking out Pat's stream, sorry but I'm in the same place he is right now
[0:33:53] <%Brassnarwhal> mom and dad are fighting
[0:33:57] <+DamnFineCupofStreaming> break out the dual screen viewing
[0:34:00] <%Brassnarwhal> they are making us choose
[0:34:03] <@MelBrooksKA> You can always do multi twitch
[0:34:03] <%arran_throttle> arran_throttle subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 24 months, currently on a 23 month streak! SOOOOOOUUULLLLLLS
[0:34:19] <sriracha_cream> Guys, all the money you give to both streams goes in the same house lmao
[0:34:24] <%Brassnarwhal> @melbrookska does that work on mobile?
[0:34:27] <%Cozy90> hi everyone!
[0:34:32] <%thejimjamz> The red hood really suites this version of peach, very striking
[0:34:34] <+RedMaskBandit> or watch both of them
[0:34:38] <+FadingEmber> Okay I need to know, has he beat a boss?
[0:34:42] <+Nod80> Pat's going to play into the wee hours of the morning
[0:34:43] <Ell1ot> is the PC version fixed yet? I'd like to play
[0:34:47] <%Brassnarwhal> @sriracha_cream it's about who i watch not who i pay
[0:34:52] <+FadingEmber> *she
[0:34:52] <drawie_holly> I'll never call them runes
[0:34:56] <%Cozy90> im not gonna stop caling it souls, bonfires, humanities. its been too many years
[0:34:58] <+FadingEmber> I meant you
[0:35:14] <@MelBrooksKA> @Brassnarwhal I guess if you do it through the web, you have to usually go to a separate webpage, I use kadgar.net
[0:35:16] <drawie_holly> and I'll never call the echoes or anything else
[0:35:17] <%Brassnarwhal> @fadingember she beat godrick I'm pretty sure
[0:35:21] <+FadingEmber> crap I need to check vods
[0:35:58] <+FadingEmber> make it night time
[0:36:06] <%Brassnarwhal> you can fix it whenever if it bugs you the mirror is free
[0:36:15] <%thejimjamz> I still can't get over the ET heads on those boys
[0:36:21] <+FadingEmber> I think there is something special in this area at night
[0:36:33] <@MelBrooksKA> Breadth first search vs depth first search algorithms
[0:36:43] <%Brassnarwhal> @thejimjamz the game describes them as dumpy frog heads in an ash of war description, i love them
[0:36:50] <%wizard_of_diamonds> Yeah, I was here at night yesterday. It was SPECIAL
[0:36:51] <drawie_holly> there is?
[0:36:56] <drawie_holly> at night
[0:37:03] <udurbalanced> Friendly air balloon?
[0:37:12] <%nip_nips> it looks like a friendo to me
[0:37:12] <drawie_holly> shit i gotta check it out
[0:37:13] <%Brassnarwhal> @udurbalanced enemy air balloon
[0:37:19] <udurbalanced> Go give em a hug
[0:37:20] <glass_marcus> Party Balloon
[0:37:21] <+KingpinLarry> I'm not very fond of the character creator in this game. It looks better than the old games, but there's still the problem with parts I already edited being stretched when editing another part.
[0:37:25] <+FadingEmber> fortnight
[0:37:25] <udurbalanced> More arms to hold your hand with
[0:37:27] <Willowight> skelton balloon?
[0:37:31] <@MelBrooksKA> Corpse balloon
[0:37:40] <%Fuggins4U> they wildin
[0:37:41] <+KingpinLarry> Also no black hairstyles.
[0:37:46] <%Brassnarwhal> the ashes to summon the bow ones of these are incredibly good
[0:38:11] <bassoontyphoon> Paiges dream party decoration, a balloon that drops skeletons onto the guests
[0:38:17] <drawie_holly> you can pop the balloon
[0:38:22] <Danitaras> 69 nice
[0:38:33] <%SveriSageAdvice> yup
[0:38:33] <+FadingEmber> ...yeah
[0:38:35] <sriracha_cream> None
[0:38:36] <@CreepyPorpoise> Yeah
[0:38:40] <%wizard_of_diamonds> Basically
[0:38:42] <glass_marcus> the hair game is weak in this one
[0:38:42] <drawie_holly> yeah they give soul items
[0:38:44] <Mister_McDerp> there never is
[0:38:44] <%Brassnarwhal> basically
[0:38:51] <+RedMaskBandit> never any
[0:38:52] <@CreepyPorpoise> its basically the same hair they've had for the last 15 years
[0:38:53] <+Nod80> unless you count bald
[0:39:00] <+KingpinLarry> there's a jew fro and that's the closest thing
[0:39:01] <%wizard_of_diamonds> Woolie was super bummed as a first impression
[0:39:05] <udurbalanced> Paige out here profilin
[0:39:16] <%Brassnarwhal> theres the one short haired black girl base that looks okay but it's an anime black person not a real person
[0:39:19] <drawie_holly> yeah the character creation is eh. they haven't updated it at all basically
[0:39:29] <%Fuggins4U> that turtle is the final boss
[0:39:30] <Danitaras> "are you a bad man?" (proceeds to backstab him)
[0:39:30] <@CreepyPorpoise> hopefully for whatever game they do next they'll expand it a bit, but who knows.
[0:39:31] <+KingpinLarry> Hopefully the mod community will pull through
[0:39:32] <%Cozy90> man i just had a host use me as cannon fodder fir a mob and then un summon me. what a dick
[0:39:34] <%MisterRockett> Please someone show Japanese game developers what Sistah Curls look like I swear they will love them.
[0:39:36] <%Brassnarwhal> just the textures
[0:39:37] <urkleturtle> i think thats a dog
[0:39:37] <%thejimjamz> If there is no dreads option woolies first option is make strong tomboy. A man of culture
[0:39:37] <glass_marcus> I'm just mad they got rid of twin tails
[0:39:38] <@CreepyPorpoise> character create isn't really their focus
[0:39:38] <%MisterRockett> Someone show them Us!
[0:39:40] <%CptCreampuff16> time for more backseat gaming
[0:39:40] <%nip_nips> "i dont think any men are coming" Kappa
[0:39:44] <drawie_holly> I love the turtles
[0:40:00] <%Brassnarwhal> Dog Ahead
[0:40:05] <@CreepyPorpoise> Nintendo has actually been pretty good about adding black hairstyles to their games lately
[0:40:07] <udurbalanced> After Tommy Wiseau made himself in Dark Souls they knew they peaked
[0:40:15] <secret_npc> hey Peach I've always wanted to know, what was it like when you and Pat saw your respective animations? Was there excitement, were there rewatches?
[0:40:17] <%thejimjamz> Nope.avi
[0:40:31] <%Brassnarwhal> @creepyporpoise monhun does the dlc black hairstyles too
[0:40:38] <ShyGirafffe> is that anor londo ?
[0:40:46] <%CptCreampuff16> what is she doing right now?
[0:40:51] <%Fuggins4U> i think it's insane that BotW managed to do that on basically a big smartphone
[0:41:05] <secret_npc> the animated sequences dude
[0:41:08] <%Brassnarwhal> @fuggins4u that's an insult to my smartphone
[0:41:09] <%SveriSageAdvice> oh you mean the Volta animations?
[0:41:12] <udurbalanced> Your horse can double jump??
[0:41:18] <drawie_holly> YEAH
[0:41:26] <secret_npc> Like the breaks and Pat's intro?
[0:41:35] <drawie_holly> i only figured out the double jump like 40 hours in
[0:41:40] <udurbalanced> Double jumping horse.  Revolutionary
[0:41:58] <%ChrisPlaysThing> I still need to reach out to Volta and commission an intro
[0:42:10] <secret_npc> they're so great
[0:42:42] <%Fuggins4U> bearly made it
[0:42:44] <%thejimjamz> BEARS
[0:42:45] <Danitaras> play dead!
[0:42:57] <+SaltySeaSam> there is no God. only megabear
[0:42:58] <@CreepyPorpoise> I haaaaaaaaate these bears.
[0:43:02] <%Fuggins4U> what a grizzly death
[0:43:02] <drawie_holly> yeah the animation stuff in you and pats streams is super creative
[0:43:13] <vicar_anat> The most dangerous creature in any Fantasy world: a big bear
[0:43:27] <%thejimjamz> Someone call Tierzoo, they made the shortfaced bear in this game
[0:43:33] <%Fuggins4U> whoooaaa
[0:43:37] <%nip_nips> MOON
[0:43:39] <@CreepyPorpoise> wow
[0:43:42] <Danitaras> shaaaadoooowssss
[0:43:57] <%thejimjamz> shadooowwwpuuuzzzllleeeee
[0:44:02] <secret_npc> a huge shadow going over me is the last thing I wanna see in a From game lmao
[0:44:27] <drawie_holly> they're said they're gonna patch in ray tracing eventually i think
[0:44:32] <%wizard_of_diamonds> Hey @PeachSaliva did you know there's a random noble/hollow mob that upon being killed transforms into the bear you just ran from?
[0:44:35] <%wizard_of_diamonds> ASK ME HOW I KNOW THIS
[0:44:57] <%wizard_of_diamonds> YOU BET
[0:45:03] <%wizard_of_diamonds> I damn near shit myself
[0:45:07] <%Fuggins4U> i can't wait to play this game once they patch in easy mode and infinite estus
[0:45:24] <drawie_holly> sometimes you can find random hollows carrying treasure chests
[0:45:25] <%thejimjamz> @wizard_of_diamonds for a last ditch dying trick, transforming into a giant bear is a pretty good trick
[0:45:46] <%wizard_of_diamonds> @thejimjamz "Always be yourself. Unless you can be a giant bear."
[0:46:00] <+AcidRelic> There is easy mode, compared to the rest of the series, called Horse, Ashes and Flask Regen after combat
[0:46:05] <drawie_holly> i think it's one of the hardest
[0:46:07] <glass_marcus> If you aren't prepared it's one of the harder ones
[0:46:15] <%wizard_of_diamonds> Giant MAGIC ghost.
[0:46:48] <glass_marcus> turf war
[0:46:48] <%thejimjamz> "why is he mad" is a good question in many souls games
[0:46:53] <+DamnFineCupofStreaming> verr big verr blue
[0:47:02] <%thejimjamz> F
[0:47:10] <Gruhunchously> RIP
[0:47:24] <udurbalanced> A height peach could not reach
[0:47:26] <+RedMaskBandit> yeah that guy fucks
[0:47:31] <%wizard_of_diamonds> He's a spooky magic ghost
[0:47:34] <%SveriSageAdvice> he's a summon
[0:47:59] <+RedMaskBandit> he's a magic summon from the magic people academy
[0:48:20] <%SveriSageAdvice> ooo nice i never caught a rainbow through here before
[0:48:42] <MelfinaStarwind> loved your "short stream" yesterday fhaeAYAYA
[0:49:14] <+HelveticaScenario> This game, accessible? LUL It gives the illusion of being accessible because it lets you run around in a field, but everything you run into is a brick wall if you're not ready for a challenge.
[0:49:22] <%CptCreampuff16> elden ring does that you think its a couple hours bamn 2 days havepassed
[0:49:31] <Xelig> Hey Peach! I can't watch Pat because he's too far ahead of me and I don't want spoilers, so I came to see you
[0:49:54] <+RedMaskBandit> @helveticascenario you can always run away from walls in this game. not the others where you're locked in.
[0:50:14] <drawie_holly> yeah Margit kicked my ass for real
[0:50:16] <glass_marcus> Not really walls, just wide pillars
[0:50:17] <secret_npc> Any boss that killed me I didn't try again until, like, tens of hours later and they were easy mode
[0:50:18] <+HelveticaScenario> You're just delaying the challenge.
[0:50:23] <glass_marcus> you can go around them
[0:50:32] <Pixel_Butts> come back when you can 2 shot that wall
[0:50:38] <%hereiam407> Good ups
[0:50:57] <drawie_holly> I've found some bosses that kicked my ass even with like decent weapons
[0:51:14] <drawie_holly> and some weapons that are BUSTED
[0:51:32] <secret_npc> for all the talk of skill and whatnot, this game's difficulty can be easily managed with stats, like any normal rpg
[0:51:43] <secret_npc> number the problem away
[0:51:48] <+HelveticaScenario> People who bounce off these games, will delay the challenge by running around, then hit a wall and still give up. The older games just speed up the process
[0:51:49] <drawie_holly> oh i did not see this one
[0:52:05] <drawie_holly> cliff's a bottom?
[0:52:09] <+adamisbarely3d> Elden Ring got so much mainstream hype around it that people who would never have tried Soulsbournkiro before are getting a real taste of what those games are like, and some of them are lear j
[0:52:21] <+adamisbarely3d> goddamn typoes
[0:52:37] <secret_npc> @helveticascenario whether or not that's true, as someone who bounced off the older games, this one let me get real strong real easy
[0:52:49] <+adamisbarely3d> some of them are learning that they actually like the challenge
[0:53:13] <%MooseIsGoose> Are you liking that sword thinking of respecing to it. Right now I am big strength and holy so no dex.
[0:53:21] <drawie_holly> guard counters work really well against these guys
[0:53:43] <udurbalanced> The rampaging rump roast?  The waddling wellington?  The galloping porkchop?  The meatloaf marauder?
[0:53:44] <OverzealousEuthanasiast> zangief demand attentions!
[0:53:52] <+FadingEmber> I feel like there is a lack of big swords in this game
[0:54:10] <%MooseIsGoose> They drop a helmet
[0:54:12] <+FadingEmber> a lot of halberds though
[0:54:19] <%MooseIsGoose> Oh my god
[0:54:20] <tanarath> He's dying! Attention is the only cure.
[0:54:22] <+tussletoes> going imp mode
[0:54:24] <Parapattern> I thought you said "M Preg"
[0:54:27] <@CreepyPorpoise> wow
[0:54:28] <drawie_holly> i tried to get this for hours
[0:54:30] <+HelveticaScenario> @adamisbarely3d I like that it's tricking some people into actually sticking with it. These games are so good for the most part
[0:54:33] <MelfinaStarwind> imp (fanged)
[0:54:38] <+adamisbarely3d> big imp hours
[0:54:38] <drawie_holly> and couldn't find it at all
[0:54:41] <%hereiam407> Clap
[0:54:42] <+FadingEmber> read its ability in the text description
[0:54:44] <+AcidRelic> Wow, yeah, I tried all night two nights ago
[0:54:46] <secret_npc> those fcking stone heads are so buff but they kill the fashion souos game
[0:54:50] <secret_npc> souls*
[0:54:51] <+tussletoes> it's drip or down out here smh
[0:55:08] <+tussletoes> *drown lol
[0:55:10] <+AcidRelic> @secret_npc  that is the Fashion Souls, ;)
[0:55:49] <+AcidRelic> But I'm also Green like the Hulk... my opinion may not be good, haha
[0:56:10] <%MooseIsGoose> If I remember right this one is stupid to solve
[0:56:17] <Gruhunchously> Forshadowing
[0:56:33] <drawie_holly> these tiny dungeons are really good
[0:56:37] <tanarath> Don't be sorry Paige, it's why we watch you. be you.
[0:56:45] <glass_marcus> Oh I remember this dungeon...I got bodied a more than a few times here
[0:56:52] <%thejimjamz> Legit snorted at the insult name "Ding dong"
[0:56:54] <udurbalanced> He can't murder you that's illegal
[0:57:28] <%nip_nips> i hate people who put warning messages right at the trigger point
[0:57:43] <+tussletoes> don't be a d*ng d*ng
[0:57:45] <%Ranryu692> you can't call your mom a penis
[0:57:48] <Pokakaa> F
[0:57:53] <glass_marcus> He;s got combos
[0:57:54] <%thejimjamz> Dang, that guy fucks
[0:57:57] <Gruhunchously> What the f*ck did you just f*cking say to me you little d*ng d*ng?
[0:58:04] <Parapattern> What is it with moms and major injuries to their hands?!
[0:58:07] <Pixel_Butts> did you know you can hold down to go back the first equip item? instead of cycling thru all your items
[0:58:08] <MelfinaStarwind> oh noo lol
[0:58:09] <+RedMaskBandit> inheritance at risk
[0:58:30] <Gruhunchously> call his a 'enis
[0:58:47] <%hereiam407> Guest star
[0:59:39] <udurbalanced> Peach confirmed for Pat's big sister
[0:59:44] <%wizard_of_diamonds> I was going to say "unhinged" but sure LUL
[1:00:00] <Bloomingzonda> What are you doing step paige
[1:00:02] <%Ranryu692> lol

[1:00:03] <+RedMaskBandit> I like the stories where she just roast Pat
[1:00:04] <%thejimjamz> Would you say she's a "peach"
[1:00:07] <Zeif00> Doesn't she clench her fists just like Pat?
[1:00:08] <Gruhunchously> Sweetly unhinged
[1:00:18] <@MelBrooksKA> Does Pat's dad have a cute Qebecer accent?
[1:00:49] <+FadingEmber> Does he have Cotton Hill energy?
[1:01:14] <udurbalanced> So she's from Minnesota?
[1:01:16] <+Maleicus> it doesnt
[1:01:16] <@MelBrooksKA> Oh hey der hon hon
[1:01:29] <Bloomingzonda> Canada is home to the sexiest accent on earth. Nothing like a Newfoundland accent
[1:01:54] <secret_npc> I saw The Batmans and I think you and Pat will love what a fcking weirdo Rob Pattinson's Bruce Wayne in it
[1:02:10] <secret_npc> whoa!!!

[1:03:09] <tanarath> rip
[1:03:12] <%CptCreampuff16> this cave made me so angry
[1:03:15] <Gruhunchously> ma'am, you are interrupting our rave, please leave
[1:03:17] <+RedMaskBandit> running away is always a viable strategy
[1:03:20] <Bloomingzonda> My dad is from Minnesota and he gets the accent back when he talks to his relatices on the phone
[1:03:21] <%MooseIsGoose> Scyth
[1:03:23] <%DJLavender> Lol run from I enemy just to run into 3 more. Classic Peach
[1:03:32] <tanarath> Do you have a lantern yet?
[1:04:27] <Major_Monotone> Oooo excellent taste in weaponry
[1:05:02] <+FadingEmber> man a lot of the bosses in this game love to spin with swords like they're beyblades
[1:05:16] <Bloomingzonda> When pat came here chat said it was his family
[1:05:32] <Major_Monotone> Oh man those lil guys are great, what goofy dudes
[1:05:44] <Danitaras> loud pat is loud
[1:06:10] <udurbalanced> All hail Papa Nurgle
[1:06:17] <Danitaras> oh don't e sorry, it's funny
[1:06:22] <%realm_forge> Pat has made the bidet squeak many times in his play through so far
[1:06:22] <Danitaras> be^
[1:06:22] <%hereiam407> Never thought I'd hear those words mixed together
[1:06:26] <Bloomingzonda> The hurty sand resonates with his voice and amplifies it
[1:06:40] <Major_Monotone> Clean rot? Isn’t that fermentation?
[1:07:09] <Bloomingzonda> its when you clean a large mostly black dog
[1:07:12] <Shockmaster182> Ayo, new helmet
[1:07:46] <Major_Monotone> Maybe a wine mom of some kind
[1:08:27] <Bloomingzonda> What if the trolls don't have guts because they are used to make balloons
[1:08:57] <udurbalanced> That's not a very good boy
[1:08:59] <JobbedBone> F:
[1:09:02] <+AcidRelic> Dogs stucklock SUCKS
[1:09:04] <+FadingEmber> it be like that sometimes
[1:09:05] <+Nekros4442> the classic
[1:09:07] <+AcidRelic> stunlock
[1:09:11] <secret_npc> those are the two worst enemies and you got them together
[1:09:22] <Major_Monotone> Could this be dog?
[1:09:25] <Bloomingzonda> @PeachSaliva has anyone informed you that you were stolen from
[1:09:39] <+FadingEmber> those dogs only have one attack and love to spam it
[1:10:33] <Bloomingzonda> In the castle every time you died a portion of your souls were taken
[1:10:58] <glass_marcus> Castle Tax
[1:11:03] <%SveriSageAdvice> yeah the gate dude took em
[1:11:11] <Bloomingzonda> Remember the guy that was stepping on Godrick after you killed him he folows you
[1:11:17] <Anderobot> Yeah, you lose like 10%
[1:11:19] <tanarath> Is it given back to you when you defeat the gate dude?
[1:11:20] <%SveriSageAdvice> apparently if you kill the gate dude you get them all back
[1:11:26] <%SveriSageAdvice> but i refuse to do that, im not mean
[1:11:35] <Major_Monotone> Damn, gatekeeping even in soul collection
[1:11:39] <Anderobot> You only get them back if you kill him before you kill godrick
[1:11:40] <%SveriSageAdvice> he is a merchant ye
[1:11:43] <+FadingEmber> the tombstone above your skill denotes areas where you pay rune tax I believe
[1:11:47] <%DJLavender> Yeah, I think you can catch him following you around the castle
[1:11:53] <Bloomingzonda> Apparenly throughout the level you can see him watching you from bushes and stuff
[1:12:23] <secret_npc> that's spooky!
[1:12:28] <Danitaras> dooooot
[1:12:33] <+HelveticaScenario> @Bloomingzonda Are you serious? LUL I didn't notice that
[1:12:36] <Gruhunchously> sp00ky
[1:13:07] <Bloomingzonda> Yeah also you can catch him on the roof of where rogier hangs out and he gives you something
[1:13:28] <Danitaras> doot denied
[1:13:38] <+MooseIsGoose> He just wanted to play you a song
[1:14:17] <Gruhunchously> Thems some big birds
[1:14:29] <Bloomingzonda> They should make it so there is a 1/500 chance or something of the doot men dooting with their butt
[1:14:50] <+MooseIsGoose> He was pulling that cart on the bridge
[1:14:55] <%Ranryu692> I just went and killed gatekeeper guy and did not get runes lol
[1:14:59] <eyeobject> Hello funny mustard lady! Are you ringing the elden?
[1:15:14] <Bloomingzonda> @Ranryu692 you got a bearing though right
[1:15:29] <Gruhunchously> All my homies are playing Elden Ring
[1:15:53] <Bloomingzonda> He is just a normal troll
[1:15:58] <%Ranryu692> @Ranryu692 yeah
[1:16:02] <Mister_McDerp> you got this
[1:16:11] <+MooseIsGoose> That spear is pretty cool
[1:16:22] <%thbluewarden> fuck him up!
[1:16:30] <Tiger_Karnival> Meowdy folks! :D
[1:16:49] <Gruhunchously> Well...that's one way to chain something I guess
[1:17:04] <%thbluewarden> and you were worried
[1:17:36] <+MooseIsGoose> The giant was pulling it but bridge broke
[1:18:02] <Tiger_Karnival> Take a dive, what could go wrong?
[1:18:21] <WizardofWazz> You can hear Pat screaming
[1:18:47] <atlasdotwav> pat howls at
[1:19:27] <%Ranryu692> I hate that
[1:19:27] <%wizard_of_diamonds> I just hope you're feeling better
[1:19:37] <Bloomingzonda> Yeah that happens to me when I forget to eat
[1:19:38] <%Ranryu692> all too familiar with that feeling
[1:19:38] <%wizard_of_diamonds> Yeah I've been there
[1:19:43] <%thbluewarden> yeah, how're you feeling today?
[1:19:45] <Gruhunchously> yeah...
[1:19:46] <+DamnFineCupofStreaming> I'm there now
[1:19:54] <+FadingEmber> I didn't watch but the boss fights probably didn't help
[1:20:01] <+adamisbarely3d> that's why I always keep some savory crackers and cheese around
[1:20:31] <Bloomingzonda> Usually if I get the hunger woozles  but don't feel hungry I have noticed that pooping helps
[1:20:45] <+adamisbarely3d> even if I don't want them, they're not objectionable and they'll "wake your stomach up" and get you to want to eat again.
[1:20:52] <DancesWitBalrog> wait, I thought it was a Yak
[1:21:02] <+Ches_Neckbeard> is Gief attacking Pat?
[1:21:09] <Bloomingzonda> Its a Hoat
[1:21:11] <%Agami23> club crackers are always good to keep around.
[1:21:14] <%DJLavender> Those steps only go down
[1:21:21] <+MooseIsGoose> I have played 40 hours and it still makes me weird out when platforming is a thing
[1:21:24] <Gruhunchously> Goatest of all time
[1:21:32] <%Th3SmartAlec> I feel like the horns were literally a joke they put in after seeing how it climbed
[1:21:33] <Major_Monotone> It’s Yakul from Princess Mononoke!
[1:21:42] <Mister_McDerp> it's a horse with horns, cuz its hooves aren't cloven
[1:21:43] <%Ranryu692> are goats even good climbers?
[1:21:45] <udurbalanced> Yes
[1:21:48] <udurbalanced> Fight
[1:21:55] <DancesWitBalrog> @ranryu692 DUDE. YES
[1:21:57] <Bloomingzonda> @Ranryu692 Mountain Goats
[1:22:01] <+KingpinLarry> accidentally pressing the crouch button deactivates the gorse (goat horse)
[1:22:03] <%Ranryu692> Mountain goats aren't goats
[1:22:06] <thetruenicster> They Crave That Mineral
[1:22:12] <%Th3SmartAlec> 89 degrees motherfu####
[1:22:13] <+FadingEmber> goats hate gravity
[1:22:13] <%Ranryu692> mountain goats are antelopes
[1:22:15] <Gruhunchously> They Crave That Mineral
[1:22:17] <+adamisbarely3d> spider goat, spider goat
[1:22:21] <%Ranryu692> actually not goats, they're antelopes lol
[1:22:23] <Mister_McDerp> those goats climbing a dam
[1:22:23] <DancesWitBalrog> the mineral is like crack for them
[1:22:31] <%nip_nips> they reject gravity
[1:22:32] <Danitaras> sometimes you gotta wonder..."who the fuck put those tombstones in the walls" lol
[1:22:34] <OverzealousEuthanasiast> Mountain goats are actually spiders
[1:22:43] <+RedMaskBandit> yeah in the King's man movie it shows a couple of them on the side of cliff just liking salt
[1:22:44] <udurbalanced> There are pictures of them climbing the Hoover dam
[1:22:52] <%Ranryu692> Mountain goats aren't actually goats, though lol they're antelopes
[1:23:01] <+adamisbarely3d> @danitaras GRRM put them there
[1:23:01] <Bloomingzonda> @Ranryu692 no the mountain goats in north america are in the same family as other goats
[1:23:05] <Gruhunchously> The only reason goats haven't taken over the world yet is because they don't care enough
[1:23:15] <Mister_McDerp> mountain antelope doesn't sound as cool
[1:23:20] <Danitaras> @adamisbarely3d ah so that's his credit
[1:23:29] <+FadingEmber> screw you *walks up vertical incline*
[1:23:44] <%Th3SmartAlec> Kappa
[1:23:44] <OverzealousEuthanasiast> Goats will reclaim this planet once they realize we're killing off all their juicy grass
[1:23:49] <+adamisbarely3d> @danitaras yup. boss names and statuary
[1:23:55] <+RedMaskBandit> how close are you to the monitor?
[1:24:08] <+CalderGaming> lol poor ranryu
[1:24:08] <Bloomingzonda> Yeah goats can climb trees
[1:24:12] <%Th3SmartAlec> YOU THOUGHT
[1:24:12] <Gruhunchously> oof
[1:24:14] <karawra> Oh nooo
[1:24:20] <%nip_nips> THIS IS FINE
[1:24:27] <Mister_McDerp> gravity is the hardest boss
[1:24:46] <udurbalanced> Peach's greatest enemy: the Y axis
[1:24:57] <%nip_nips> i heard someone say the game just goes by its gut feeling on whether fall damage kills you
[1:25:04] <%Th3SmartAlec> LUL I'm literally exploring the same zone right now. I'm using markers to highlight portions of the map I've explorred
[1:25:27] <OverzealousEuthanasiast> it's sadder when the souls are lost to it too. I recommend taking zero chances with elevated jumping when tryna get back corpse drop
[1:25:33] <%DJLavender> Dropping rainbow stones over a ledge will determine whether a height is fatal, if they break then it's fatal
[1:25:41] <%nip_nips> aint nobody got time for that
[1:26:15] <%CptCreampuff16> any goal for this session?
[1:26:20] <+Maleicus> missed
[1:26:21] <+adamisbarely3d> rainbow stones were fine back in Dark Souls, but now we have the power of the Jump zbu
[1:26:22] <RedPanda25> u missed your runes
[1:26:22] <Bloomingzonda> PAIGE you mised your souls

[1:26:55] <%wizard_of_diamonds> Maybe not, but you'd definitely lose it LUL
[1:26:55] <%Th3SmartAlec> Junji Ito has entered the chat
[1:26:56] <+adamisbarely3d> donde esta your SHIT
[1:26:58] <@commanderclaw> Paige's head would float away as the Willy Wonka finale song plays
[1:27:03] <+patriotrenegade> time for crab

[1:27:23] <%CptCreampuff16> why are you killing Aurelias friends
[1:27:39] <Gruhunchously> Woman slaughters local wildlife: The Game

[1:28:20] <+adamisbarely3d> craft the ability to percieve
[1:28:29] <+FadingEmber> Paige just outed herself as a Dulahand I think

[1:28:38] <%ChrisPlaysThing> read to the theme of DuckTails
[1:28:44] <@commanderclaw> Wait, you have 3 golden seeds?

[1:28:57] <+patriotrenegade> yeah you dont have it
[1:29:03] <+MooseIsGoose> They auto put the recipe in the list
[1:29:06] <%nip_nips> they automatically add the recipes to the crafting menu
[1:29:07] <Danitaras> oh...whoops
[1:29:14] <Danitaras> sorry i thought you had to read them lol
[1:29:19] <derap41> you read them?
[1:29:51] <+patriotrenegade> im 40 hours in and i still dont have poison heal consumables
[1:29:53] <%CptCreampuff16> you gotta go find the book that has the recipe
[1:30:17] <+MooseIsGoose> There is a bull crap poison cave in this area I think
[1:30:41] <Gruhunchously> Poison bull crap, yeah
[1:30:44] <%Ranryu692> I'm pretty sure I know where the merchant who sells the recipe for poison is
[1:30:45] <%Th3SmartAlec> No, the poison is FUN Kappa

[1:31:17] <Gruhunchously> Venom > Poison, everytime
[1:31:26] <MaybeFalco> oh yeah this is the fun cave
[1:31:36] <%nip_nips> at least its just poison and not scarlet rot though
[1:31:39] <+patriotrenegade> aw shes so scared
[1:31:39] <+MooseIsGoose> You also fight the boss here in poison I think
[1:31:42] <MaybeFalco> yes
[1:31:46] <%nip_nips> "Fun" cave
[1:31:48] <$Trenr> I enjoyed it
[1:31:54] <+adamisbarely3d> someone will die. of fun!
[1:31:54] <Gruhunchously> It's a 'we like watching you suffer' fun cave
[1:31:57] <@Jekado> its a souls like its always a party cave
[1:32:02] <$Trenr> But I can also see how others would not
[1:32:02] <%rumtumtugnutz> Isn;t that a euphemism for a butthole?
[1:32:04] <%CptCreampuff16> theres a merchant who sells the book if you wanna go get it
[1:32:05] <%nip_nips> @Gruhunchously yep, its fun.. for US
[1:32:19] <Danitaras> it's Friday, treat yourself

[1:32:50] <%ChrisPlaysThing> More like Yeet yourself

[1:33:14] <%nip_nips> steam says ive got 94 hours in elden ring over the past week FeelsAmazingMan
[1:33:17] <%CptCreampuff16> time isnt real
[1:33:29] <+MooseIsGoose> yes
[1:33:42] <+adamisbarely3d> paige you are the opposite of an immortal
[1:33:59] <+adamisbarely3d> you are EXTREMELY MORTAL
[1:34:08] <@MelBrooksKA> If you're immortal you're one of those immortals that got a really shitty deal
[1:34:18] <MelfinaStarwind> @nip_nips bojangles melfin1Hypers
[1:34:29] <@CreepyPorpoise> Yeah, immersion is key
[1:34:46] <%strakillias> And be sure to always get on the first train available.
[1:34:50] <MelfinaStarwind> @nip_nips @nip_nips wrong reply whoops
[1:34:52] <%rumtumtugnutz> Paiige has lycanthropy.
[1:35:10] <+MooseIsGoose> That man from the beginning is here now
[1:35:59] <Ell1ot> i woke up from a nap and now Paige has a goblin head
[1:36:03] <+MooseIsGoose> Yup and covered in blood
[1:36:04] <%SveriSageAdvice> it does matter, i chose the top
[1:36:06] <Tiger_Karnival> Only matters in relation to him
[1:36:07] <Bloomingzonda> Tell him try finger butt hole
[1:36:11] <%SveriSageAdvice> just to him tho
[1:36:12] <%rumtumtugnutz> I learned from Yakuza not to go to Japan if you're Asian and not Japanese.
[1:36:14] <+MooseIsGoose> Or scarlet rot
[1:36:14] <dan_g_v> cherry juice
[1:36:19] <+RedMaskBandit> Blood God follower ahead
[1:36:23] <AngryPumpkin1995> those fingers were all kinds of fucked up
[1:36:24] <@MelBrooksKA> "Bitch, your sacred symbol is fucked"
[1:36:33] <%SveriSageAdvice> top would make him like you
[1:36:37] <Tiger_Karnival> Top option = likes you
[1:36:37] <%nip_nips> first one is good for him
[1:36:39] <%TheotherKristian> This choice FUCKED ME,
[1:36:43] <MaybeFalco> the choice doesn't matter, but picking the top on will progress his quest
[1:36:45] <+MooseIsGoose> He was talking smackabout the 2 fingers so top
[1:36:52] <%SveriSageAdvice> does not affect anything else
[1:36:57] <Willowight> idk, they were magnificent in a certain way
[1:36:59] <%TheotherKristian> 8 minutes later, I was invaded
[1:36:59] <+abittershark> Say that they didn’t seem right
[1:37:12] <drawie_holly> not immediately
[1:37:17] <drawie_holly> eventually tho
[1:37:19] <+CalderGaming> @theotherkristian that may have been completely unrelates
[1:37:23] <nomolomo> i feel like i know his voice from something else
[1:37:28] <+CalderGaming> unrelated*
[1:37:52] <%nip_nips> invasion item
[1:38:01] <%TheotherKristian> @caldergaming Maybe but I made a choice, then I went to the safe haven place
[1:38:07] <dan_g_v> time to kill some people
[1:38:22] <Sunstalker> Invade chatters with password? D:
[1:38:25] <Mister_McDerp> now invade pat
[1:38:31] <%nip_nips> password doesnt affect invasion afaik
[1:38:34] <Sunstalker> HE FINGERED YOU? D:
[1:38:35] <%rumtumtugnutz> sgniR nedlE rehto emos regnif og ot emiT
[1:38:35] <Danitaras> dinner first sir
[1:38:47] <%TheotherKristian> Now fight Pat lol
[1:38:47] <Anderobot> Lmao good luck fighting two players at once
[1:39:14] <+Bailey__Gaming> I feel like Vicar Amelia is going to jump out at any point
[1:39:14] <%rumtumtugnutz> What the entire fuck, why was my chat backwards. o_o
[1:39:20] <+CalderGaming> @peachsaliva that guy Varre is same voice actor as the Curator from Dark Pictures
[1:39:26] <Gruhunchously> The Lord of Blood?
[1:39:35] <sriracha_cream> Blood for the Blood God?????
[1:39:56] <+Bailey__Gaming> a person Born from Blood? hmmm
[1:40:07] <dan_g_v> first try,
[1:40:12] <%TheotherKristian> Damn, you strong
[1:40:14] <+emperordread> Could you show map for a second plz? Been playing 60+ hours and never seen this place
[1:40:17] <%Th3SmartAlec> LUL WUT
[1:40:23] <+CalderGaming> @theotherkristian that invasion was tied to an item you picked up from somewhere nearby here, not Varre. I had the same thing happen
[1:40:23] <Willowight> i love weapons that let you move like a weirdo
[1:40:28] <nomolomo> ooooh the white masked guy also voices the curator from house of ashes etc.!
[1:40:28] <+MooseIsGoose> There face reminds me of zangief
[1:40:29] <+FadingEmber> Fun fact: yugioh considered the term blood rose not appropriate and censored it to ruddy rose
[1:40:37] <%AncelDeLambert> eyyy what've I missed?
[1:40:42] <MaybeFalco> its the albinauric gymnast team
[1:41:01] <%nip_nips> he wants you to try his finger Kappa
[1:41:05] <+adamisbarely3d> ironic, bc ruddy rose sounds like a euphemism for something
[1:41:10] <%TheotherKristian> @caldergaming Interesting
[1:41:13] <+Bailey__Gaming> that dude telling you to try a finger? that's innapropriate!
[1:41:13] <+emperordread> Thank you!
[1:41:29] <+MooseIsGoose> A dragon is to the north west I think

[2:05:01] <%Th3SmartAlec> pro tip, boss hates two handing. Can confirm
[2:06:14] <Ell1ot> Pat said you have to two hand before you mount
[2:06:18] <%vivaciouseff> if you two-hand off the horse, you'll stay two-handed on the horse
[2:06:22] <Sunstalker> Th3SmartAlec But it is twohanding itself D:
