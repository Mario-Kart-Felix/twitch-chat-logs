[0:40:23] <KingKZ> Cheat
[0:40:24] <+Sir_Gawain_Lotsson> Do it while the sun is up
[0:40:26] <+Dr_Mooose> just think that everyone of your answers are wrong no matter what
[0:40:27] <%rdark_ksu> Sleep real good before
[0:40:28] <Oncamimus> JUST DONT BE ANXIOUS
[0:40:29] <%SoFarFetched> Calming music helms
[0:40:29] <Mr_Strut> masturbation
[0:40:32] <%SoFarFetched> helps*
[0:40:33] <%ryome> Imagine they’re all naked- wait, nO,
[0:40:33] <+conradical> masturbate
[0:40:34] <+Sir_Gawain_Lotsson> 4Head
[0:40:34] <+NWR_James> @PeachSaliva @Ranting_Raven No mater what happens, you can always take tests again.
[0:40:35] <kindashagg> Meditation the night before helped me out. Stretching too
[0:40:36] <Soaked_Circuits> I decided to work a trade instead.
[0:40:36] <%AmaniIsYourBoss> No matter what kind of test it is, treat them all the same. As just another test.
[0:40:36] <@Calek> I knew I was gonna fail the test anyway so I didn't worry about it
[0:40:37] <krymzen5> i also vote masturbate b4 test
[0:40:37] <+linSP> just be calm four head
[0:40:40] <%supercasualboom> Masterbate
[0:40:40] <IminyourBase> a good tip for testing anxiety is to stop it
[0:40:41] <PrettyThickandStrongDyck> Pat needs to make an ASMR vid of all those weird noises he makes
[0:40:41] <$SvenHolgersson> Realize it doesn't matter in the long haul
[0:40:42] <DrFaustMD> think about something you'll do after. it'll make it not feel like the end of the world
[0:40:43] <weissguard> Draw a flower on the black board before the test. @PeachSaliva
[0:40:44] <%skizzuto> Tests don't give me anxiety but I'm god awful with essays
[0:40:47] <SchroedingersFerret> Don't wait till the last minute to study. It's too late then.
[0:40:49] <Skatedeandre> I hate taking test
[0:40:49] <%starotter70> Ooooh
[0:40:49] <scoopyoopydoo> damn that's a fat cat
[0:40:53] <%Hobojo153> The trick is to realize that whatever happens you will survive and be able to keep going
[0:40:54] <wsintai> I never had test anxiety, but projects and homework stressed me the fuck out
[0:40:54] <ThatOneGuyYouSaw> b4 test? no, masturbate DURING the test.
[0:40:54] <%cureneckbeard> crazy talk origin story
[0:40:55] <viciousgrim> @peachsaliva do you still give some or the money to charity
[0:40:56] <+KingOfTheGeats> write your notes again
[0:40:57] <%sleepy_coffee> Fuck I hate second guessing myseld
[0:40:59] <buckwheat70> Do something really irresponsible and dangerous. Then the test won’t feel that bad.
[0:40:59] <+Sir_Gawain_Lotsson> same
[0:41:01] <generalve> PREACH
[0:41:01] <+VantomPayne> thats literally me
[0:41:02] <+littlel2012> Hey you're mine hero because i also have chronic illness and some mental crap. All your twitter chats keep me happy.
[0:41:03] <Angry_Ev1L> LUL
[0:41:03] <%arcaderabbit48> Oh look, its me
[0:41:03] <%cureneckbeard> yes
[0:41:05] <Skatedeandre> Same
[0:41:05] <%worldbrand> that happened to me my first three years
[0:41:06] <+linSP> pat's a genius thanks to crazy talk
[0:41:06] <baronvonkame> BIG BRAIN TEST ANXIETY IS THE WORST
[0:41:06] <Jeemukun> oh fuck I'm the same way
[0:41:07] <%cureneckbeard> pat smarts
[0:41:10] <%supercasualboom> @peachsaliva Maybe you are always cursed because you have so many purse.
[0:41:10] <+KongolComet> thats me!
[0:41:12] <SulfurousAcid> Tests are a race
[0:41:15] <miniscottp> if you feel anxious during the test, stretch. it helps.
[0:41:15] <scoopyoopydoo> keyword "some"
[0:41:16] <+SuichiTanaka> Good memory doesn't mean smarter, but it does mean fast tests
[0:41:16] <SulfurousAcid> always remember that
[0:41:19] <%arcaderabbit48> Yeah, that's a big reason for test anxiety in a lot of people.
[0:41:19] <Daxalog> I have bad HW anxiety. Its competing with my freetime. TIP: Do Homework before the test so it gets absorbed like studying
[0:41:20] <scoopyoopydoo> jk
[0:41:21] <%starotter70> Thankfully, all my classes allow cheat sheets
[0:41:21] <Fien111> Straight up, skip any question you spend more than like a few minutes on and come back later. You either know or don't most of the time
[0:41:23] <$DocMadfox> Pat gives an annoyed sigh at charity
[0:41:23] <SpaceGuntank> pick C for every answer, statically you have a higher chance to pass LUL
[0:41:23] <missingangle> Just fake confidence that you'll ace that bitch and then that confidence can become real
[0:41:24] <+Yakobro> da baby
[0:41:25] <Skatedeandre> I hate the feeling
[0:41:26] <$Lichelet> From one girl with a strong jaw to another, your upbeat attitude and confidence helps me feel better about myself. Thank you! Cheer100 Cheer100 Cheer100 Cheer100 Cheer100

[0:41:30] <simulationbard> There is a certain freedom in going into a test KNOWING you are going to fail
[0:41:31] <%Hobojo153> For apatBig stupid cats like emlo
[0:41:31] <IminyourBase> oh look i am patrick i am smart and compact. i am the future. OOHHH look at me
[0:41:34] <+skylerpilot> Pat has Test Overconfidence
[0:41:36] <$ShootThatZombie> Cheer100 Cheer100 Hey Paige, I'm trying to start my new, higher paying retail job but they never gave me a schedule and haven't called me in 2 weeks to complete my training. Should I be worried? Also, here's 200 bits.
[0:41:38] <PrettyThickandStrongDyck> I have the problem of treating tests like a race to be the first
[0:41:39] <corpsegoo> I'd say focus on literally anything else before the test, like cross word or painting a miniature, something that uses brain power to do to take your focus off the worry in the lead up
[0:41:41] <a_c_chirns> !uptime
[0:41:45] <cahv123> Crap I thought I was the only one like that.
[0:41:45] <+mh9s> only the most fucked up of cats
[0:41:46] <Coystick> Always go rescue for pets folks

[0:41:55] <%arcaderabbit48> Fucky cat, best cat

[0:41:57] <%starotter70> Dumpster Diving for Cats
[0:41:57] <%ThePuddingDead> hi pot meet kettle
[0:42:01] <SulfurousAcid> Tests are a race
[0:42:04] <%supercasualboom> She also put some proceeds to planting mustard seeds all over to ruin the world.
[0:42:04] <%Hobojo153> But that just makes them gooder
[0:42:05] <%worldbrand> that i will never understand
[0:42:07] <%Bailey__gaming> honestly with School tests 90 % of the Shit they make you learn is useless
[0:42:07] <Fien111> Elmo's broken as shit, don't belittle his "accomplishments"
[0:42:09] <terribleusername> if you ain't first, yer last
[0:42:12] <+conradical> masturbate during the test to slow you down
[0:42:13] <adjothetiger> @PeachSaliva nice jingle pat

[1:13:04] <UnfilteredComic> Evolve yea
[1:13:06] <+DoktorZee> oof
[1:13:08] <Sol_Install> evolve was such a good idea...
[1:13:08] <%Keyd00d> when do they add Sam survivor and Higgs killer
[1:13:10] <@Calek> Evolve did its best
[1:13:10] <DesuDesuDokiDoki> >evolve
[1:13:11] <+bubbli97> Evolve failed super hard
[1:13:13] <shiny_prinny> rip evolve
[1:13:13] <%tigerfang86> EVOLVE SOUNDED SO COOL AT THE TIME
[1:13:14] <krymzen5> Evolve was a cool idea
[1:13:15] <%tigerfang86> IM SAD
[1:13:17] <Coystick> Evolve had great title/cover art doe
[1:13:18] <LeftOverPizza13> evole was pay to win wasn't it
[1:13:19] <KingKrampus> what if Paige streamed in her Undyne cosplay
[1:13:21] <LeftOverPizza13> evolve
[1:13:21] <riantDeliration> Natural Selection was p good
[1:13:22] <Fien111> What's said is Evolve is from the guys who did Mercenaries.
[1:13:22] <+linSP> was it because the monster could hide forever
[1:13:23] <%Gogogolem> Its difficult to balance games like this.
[1:13:23] <JoeStillLife> Evolve was fun just didnt have legs
[1:13:24] <Gutsandlove> i like evolve
[1:13:25] <%Ion_Laser> Evolve had DLC before the game was developed
[1:13:26] <PrettyThickandStrongDyck> oh man I forget how that failed
[1:13:34] <BurningLlama777> Pink, gray, same thing.
[1:13:35] <OvaltineDream> pay your wrestlers, Evolve
[1:13:37] <%PauliusMaximus> it's crazy this game was made by ass to mouth
[1:13:40] <%Kenzo2000> The free evolve Beta was fun
[1:13:41] <krymzen5> @riantDeliration yoo i love natural selection
[1:13:42] <+cereal_box_conspiracy> How much does Dead by Daylight pay you to play this game?
[1:13:45] <%cureneckbeard> grey is just a very muted pink

[1:14:17] <%a_wizard_in_space> I'd love to see a Death Stranding crossover with this and instead of generators you're fixing monster energy vending machines.
[1:14:20] <+Fuggins4U> I'm sponsored by beef.
[1:14:22] <%tigerfang86> !sellout
[1:14:22] <%cureneckbeard> One of the designers on Evolve has a D&D channel on Twitch now (@mcdm). It's good
[1:14:24] <LeftOverPizza13> not disclosin sponsorship IS ILLEGAL STOP ASKING
[1:14:25] <%fattness132> I would pick this game up but it costs so much to have all the killers

[1:15:12] <+lethallunacyx> Or the one from House on Haunted Hill
[1:15:13] <%cureneckbeard> apatGib
[1:15:14] <%tigerfang86> WCDONALDS
[1:15:14] <LeftOverPizza13> the kids won't get why it's animation is shit and complain about the quality of animation on reddit
[1:15:14] <%ThePuddingDead> it'd do that eerie SCREAM AT YOU

[1:15:22] <SulfurousAcid> I'm genuinely surprided there was no Deadite killer
[1:15:22] <+nekomancerer> are there big slasher skeletons in Media?
[1:15:24] <SomersaultJustice> time for wcdonalds

[1:15:27] <+Fuggins4U> lovely.
[1:15:28] <+mh9s> he's got shitballs?
[1:15:29] <polnarefftheturtle> it should look like a 3d gif from the 2000s
[1:15:32] <Fien111> I thought you cut the shitballs out?
[1:15:32] <Oncamimus> Awww
[1:15:38] <+cereal_box_conspiracy> I can't say I haven't been there.
[1:15:41] <+vaporousTippler> Better yet, instead of one skeleton, you control the army of skeletons from Army of Darkness.
[1:15:42] <BlankKhun> Poor kitty
[1:15:44] <illustriouslangley> shit is stored in the balls
[1:15:46] <@Calek> @valriot "Oh no I hope the skeleton doesn't catch me~" probably
[1:15:47] <+TopTieramisu> i prefer MobDonald's
[1:15:49] <Fien111> Long hair cats, man
[1:15:50] <Coystick> Add a Jason Skeleton and a Huge Brazillian ass survivor
[1:15:57] <Habblewater> Too much shit not enough balls

[1:16:30] <tacostarvedbeast> what would his powers even be? make u play bad games?
[1:16:30] <Jolly_Adventurer> Tony Todd would be rad
[1:16:30] <%tigerfang86> OLD
[1:16:30] <+DoktorZee> nike shoes pumpkinhead
[1:16:30] <%PauliusMaximus> sweettooth would be a good pick
[1:16:31] <DesuDesuDokiDoki> Darth Mall
[1:16:31] <%a_wizard_in_space> I'd love to see Jeeper's Creepers in this.
[1:16:31] <JerZeyCJ> OK, but what about Jeepers Creepers?
[1:16:33] <Sol_Install> Jeepers Creepers
[1:16:33] <%juxtest> Goku should be in this game
[1:16:34] <Laecerelius> Critters would be interesting
[1:16:35] <+DoktorZee> NEMESIS
[1:16:37] <+DoktorZee> PYRAMID HEAD
[1:16:37] <%GraceTBM> almost worth the waste of effort on stupid pumpkinhead
[1:16:38] <%Keyd00d> chuckie is too small
[1:16:38] <+Dr_Mooose> would be impossible to see
[1:16:39] <%worldbrand> A xenomorph that is missing a leg
[1:16:40] <Coystick> Make Hamil Chuckie or Brad Dourif Chucky?
[1:16:42] <DesuDesuDokiDoki> NARUTO
[1:16:42] <californaya> Two Women, Hiding In Closets, Five Feet Apart Because They're Scared As Hell
[1:16:42] <devanmuse> why not get slender man from the hit Hollywood film slender man
[1:16:42] <%SoFarFetched> Candy Man
[1:16:43] <shiny_prinny> the oddjob of dbd
[1:16:43] <DedlokPM> Chunky won't be able to see
[1:16:43] <peachy996> But chucky is never slow
[1:16:43] <$SvenHolgersson> gimme Jeepers Creepers
[1:16:44] <%tigerfang86> just make a REALLY HUGE chuckie
[1:16:45] <@commanderclaw> Have him bounce up and down when he runs
[1:16:45] <%Keyd00d> chuckie is the opposite of ridley
[1:16:45] <randomlatinoguy> How would Chuckie carry survivors
[1:16:46] <ahegotrigger> I hope that Santa claus as played by Bill Goldberg could be in this game
[1:16:46] <Coystick> Mark*
[1:16:48] <+nekomancerer> Pyramid Head is STRONG
[1:16:48] <tacostarvedbeast> they should put doom guy in this game
[1:16:49] <+TopTieramisu> BABY YODA
[1:16:50] <%AlatosDiogenes> The Occulus Mirror? Kappa
[1:16:50] <Madbearv> put saber in the game
[1:16:51] <Jrocy247> Darth Vader
[1:16:51] <KingKZ> Pumpkinhead becomes a great movie after you see its sequels.
[1:16:53] <%a_wizard_in_space> Chuckie should have a mechanic where the survivors can punt him across the map
[1:16:54] <SpaceCatStation> oh thank goodness someone finally pet elmo
[1:16:56] <peachy996> Candyman would be tough
[1:16:57] <%psychodave1234> HONK
[1:16:57] <%GraceTBM> lol they should do the monster from It Follows
[1:16:57] <%MrSyne> Put in the robot from chopping mall!
[1:16:58] <%SoFarFetched> BURNING DOWN THE HOUSE
[1:16:58] <+lethallunacyx> The blob could be cool
[1:17:01] <%cureneckbeard> sipsipHonk
[1:17:02] <DesuDesuDokiDoki> S A B E R
[1:17:04] <ryderbootz> Khazrak One-Eye!
[1:17:06] <LeftOverPizza13> they could balance it by making chucky shit talk the entire time
[1:17:07] <+IMDRanged> If they can't get Pyramid Head, go with Triangle Girl.
[1:17:07] <Soulbishop> More murder
[1:17:08] <SulfurousAcid> Paige get item
[1:17:08] <wsintai> I wanna see Grandma Swamp in the game
[1:17:08] <%Kenzo2000> Sans Undertale for DBD
[1:17:09] <DedlokPM> Chucky won't be able to see over walls because he's so short
[1:17:09] <Sunstalker> I think Sideshow Bob should be in. vadeThink
[1:17:10] <MadDesperado13> the hills have eyes
[1:17:13] <krymzen5> the fly would also be cool
[1:17:14] <californaya> Big Spooks
[1:17:16] <+TopTieramisu> YUNO GASAI
[1:17:19] <CygnusRoboticus> Jeepers Creepers killer would be neat, it could fly
[1:17:20] <TheLordOfTheScrubs> can pat be a survivor in the game and his perk is to just coward out?
[1:17:21] <%PauliusMaximus> yeah
[1:17:24] <BurningLlama777> How many levels are in this game? There seem to be a good variety.
[1:17:26] <%Sora20030c> Territorial Imperative is a teachable
[1:17:29] <Oncamimus> thats a bit butt
[1:17:30] <Coystick> Add Mads Mickleson and the bonesquad
[1:17:34] <%Sora20030c> It actually has some niche uses,
[1:17:34] <DesuDesuDokiDoki> aww
[1:17:34] <tacostarvedbeast> jason is top tier?
[1:17:35] <miniscottp> @peachsaliva is the predator in this game?
[1:17:35] <MetroidSlayerP7> Candyman is Worf's brother, which is neat
[1:17:37] <KoiNoiYokan> YEAAAHH PAT
[1:17:41] <Valdorick> Pick a top tier
[1:17:42] <KoiNoiYokan> I love Pat
[1:17:43] <%Sora20030c> Freddy is so so good now
[1:17:44] <PirateMike_> Thats an ugly ass sweater
[1:17:44] <%Gogogolem> Yeah i am mad as a huntress main.
[1:17:45] <SulfurousAcid> Prayer Beads Spiri
[1:17:45] <%tigerfang86> Freddy got HUGE
[1:17:46] <+DoktorZee> Leon and Tyrant Resident Evil DLC
[1:17:47] <%zorak100229> Power Drill Massacreeeee
[1:17:48] <KoiNoiYokan> Pat is the best one
[1:17:48] <BurningLlama777> @Coystick That would actually be pretty cool.
[1:17:49] <%PauliusMaximus> but the huntress is fun D:
[1:17:49] <%tigerfang86> he got HUGE POWER
[1:17:50] <CygnusRoboticus> and where's Pumpkinhead!
[1:17:52] <SpaceGuntank> wait explain please, how is Freddy top tier now.
[1:17:52] <tacostarvedbeast> the doctor still good?
[1:17:52] <MarylandJutsu> Nurse?
[1:17:54] <Gutsandlove> i main the huntress
[1:17:54] <$GarbageNirvana> Started at the bottom now he's here
[1:17:56] <+InuOblivion> Freddy is broken
[1:17:58] <%AlatosDiogenes> My boy Freddy "Mercury" Kruger getting some love.
[1:17:58] <Rumbutt> Ghost Face is good if you don't try to use his garbage one shot
[1:17:59] <Gutsandlove> and the nurse
[1:18:00] <+nekomancerer> Mister X would be fiuckin DOPE
[1:18:01] <%a_wizard_in_space> Stealth go up!
[1:18:01] <%GraceTBM> i wish there were a little more map objective variation in this game
[1:18:02] <Dementedpenguin> Freddy was a joke for the longest time. They finally fixed him
[1:18:05] <DesuDesuDokiDoki> why si he good?
[1:18:11] <californaya> just gonna rub some skulls
[1:18:12] <Sol_Install> isn't legion good?
[1:18:16] <DedlokPM> Freddy is highest kpm, followed by Spirit (who has highest pick rate). Clown is at bottom @PeachSaliva
[1:18:17] <%Sora20030c> Nurse is still g reat
[1:18:21] <ahegotrigger> the Demigorgon is top tier
[1:18:24] <ZeeJiggle> Nah Nurse is still great she's just way more punishing if you mess up.
[1:18:28] <+DoktorZee> legion is easy to pallet loop and bully with 4SWF
[1:18:31] <+cereal_box_conspiracy> This is like co-op battle royale.
[1:18:31] <+InuOblivion> Freddy has far teleports with little cools
[1:18:33] <%Sora20030c> They just raised the skill floor
[1:18:37] <%LeonPup> Nurse was a small rework calm down pat
[1:18:37] <Gutsandlove> yeah nurse is still good
[1:18:49] <SpaceGuntank> Freddy can teleport now? what?
[1:18:50] <%Sora20030c> the charge comes up by the end of the recovery
[1:18:56] <Rumbutt> Nurse is still on top
[1:19:00] <ahegotrigger> nurse is alot worse now with cooldowns
[1:19:01] <+Ell1ot> Ell1ot subscribed with Twitch Prime. They've subscribed for 12 months! 
[1:19:01] <Oncamimus> Woah pat
[1:19:08] <+InuOblivion> Freddy teleports to generator and can place traps
[1:19:08] <%Ell1ot> hi, Paige!
[1:19:09] <+XeroSigmaPrime> Can you cook a Turkey in a Microwave?
[1:19:11] <tacostarvedbeast> think they will ever add 2 killers vs 8 survivors?
[1:19:13] <MarylandJutsu> elmos is the MOST dramatic
[1:19:14] <SilverFaustX> no
[1:19:15] <Coystick> Shelob from Return of the King could work, Frodo as a survivor be classy
[1:19:21] <%Ell1ot> sipsipHellmo
[1:19:29] <DesuDesuDokiDoki> what happened to huntress? ;_;
[1:19:29] <%Ascethetic> @PeachSaliva where do you think Oni falls on the list?
[1:19:38] <+DoktorZee> iridescent heads
[1:19:38] <Gutsandlove> i do good with huntress
[1:19:39] <honeyman18> @xerosigmaprime Check your wattage and usually only high ends.
[1:19:41] <%LeonPup> iri head huntress is terrible
[1:19:41] <%Breakfast_Megapowers> Boo!
[1:19:44] <Oncamimus> Shelob is best
[1:19:46] <+Pyrophant> i used to be super scared of the heartbeat but spine chill helped me be braver
[1:19:51] <BurningLlama777> Dang, people working quick this round
[1:19:52] <+nekomancerer> @Coystick What about a Nazghul?
[1:19:52] <Coystick> Xenomorph and Ripley?
[1:19:53] <%Breakfast_Megapowers> I am here with the Subs way
[1:19:54] <%Ell1ot> i like the huntress. she hums me a song while murdering me
[1:19:55] <DedlokPM> yeah but you only get 1 axe unless you equip a certain addon
[1:19:56] <%Ascethetic> so scrub stomper
[1:19:57] <%Sora20030c> Oni has a better billy power on a much longer CD
[1:20:00] <SulfurousAcid> GG
[1:20:01] <%PauliusMaximus> huntress has a bunvh of crazy shit she can put on her axes
[1:20:03] <+InuOblivion> People flick shot axe throws
[1:20:04] <krymzen5> jeez
[1:20:05] <DesuDesuDokiDoki> BILLY COMIN IN
[1:20:05] <SpaceGuntank> LUL
[1:20:05] <+linSP> BROO
[1:20:06] <+DoktorZee> SONIC BOOOOM
[1:20:07] <%tigerfang86> Billy can just KILL YOU
[1:20:07] <BurningLlama777> Nuuuu
[1:20:10] <Valdorick> Like how your ENTIRE team lead him to you.
[1:20:10] <Jonny_Uppercut> I'm really bummed Oni isn't better, cuz he looks badass as hell
[1:20:10] <%tigerfang86> he ZOOMS
[1:20:10] <prophetdisharmonious> Oni >>> Billy
[1:20:11] <Coystick> @nekomancerer Weathertop map unf
[1:20:12] <%LeonPup> Oni is like billy but no collision
[1:20:13] <%SoFarFetched> HIII-YAHHH
[1:20:14] <+TopTieramisu> HEEEYA
[1:20:15] <LeftOverPizza13> i saw a newbie quit dbd because of huntress lol
[1:20:17] <%Gogogolem> I am not there to save you this time paige.
[1:20:17] <+Tarage> Paige noises
[1:20:19] <Mr_Strut> HEEEeee
[1:20:20] <+InuOblivion> Look at that fast boy
[1:20:20] <+XeroSigmaPrime> @honeyman18 Cool, for some reason I could find it on google. You'd figure someone has a guide on how to microwave a Turkey
[1:20:22] <SulfurousAcid> Oni can 180 with his instadown though @PeachSaliva
[1:20:26] <Bustahhwulf> did they bring billy straight to page or he got notified if she opens the door
[1:20:28] <%D3rrtyD4n> @Tarage i was about to say the same lol
[1:20:30] <PirateMike_> My god why is his spine sideways
[1:20:31] <%SoFarFetched> Meg is very good at karate
[1:20:32] <+XeroSigmaPrime> Couldn't*
[1:20:38] <%tigerfang86> he can TURN
[1:20:40] <SilverFaustX> how is she alive
[1:20:41] <ZeeJiggle> Oni is one of the weakest killers specifically at the start of a match, but once he gets going HES GOING
[1:20:42] <%tigerfang86> oh god he can TURN
[1:20:46] <Rumbutt> PTB queues are garbage
[1:20:49] <DedlokPM> @Bustahhwulf killer can hear it if close enough
[1:20:52] <%Sora20030c> Yeah, he has MUCH more mobility when he has his power
[1:21:04] <%Sora20030c> thing is, he needs to hit people like twice to get access to his power
[1:21:04] <%Ascethetic> i might go back to DBD just for Oni
[1:21:08] <Coystick> Alien Isolation version of Xenomorph and Amanda Ripley would WORK.
[1:21:09] <%LeonPup> Oni can track you across the map if you're injured, then multiple instadowns with Billy like speed without collisions
[1:21:13] <+DoktorZee> i want onis perks for Legion
[1:21:17] <%LeonPup> Oni is going ot be nerfed to the ground
[1:21:17] <%Sora20030c> He's still my favorite killer by far though
[1:21:19] <Oncamimus> YAS
[1:21:20] <%Ascethetic> i love how loud and inttimidating he is

[1:23:07] <+nekomancerer> White chocolate isn't even chocolate

[1:23:07] <+Dr_Mooose> true
[1:23:07] <%Sora20030c> Dark Chocolate is by far the best
[1:23:07] <%FrogROOT> white

[1:24:04] <+Taisuru> olme
[1:24:04] <%a_wizard_in_space> Pat if you're looking to try League I highly highly suggest just picking a top tier character until you get more comfortable with the roster. Just go in hard OP.
[1:24:07] <TheLordOfTheScrubs> Elmo. exe has crashed, again
[1:24:08] <$Solidnick18> hug elmo pls
[1:24:08] <%Ascethetic> so have i
[1:24:09] <ahegotrigger> I was saying their should be a golden pat statue in death stranding modeled after the golden Kiryu statue in Yakuza Kiawami 2
[1:24:09] <%maskofmichael> Have you ever tried adding Cookies N Cream creamer to milk?
[1:24:09] <$Soaked_Circuits> PAT BLIND
[1:24:12] <Fien111> Reach was the best Halo, which means it's.....ok
[1:24:13] <PirateMike_> Pat whats your favorite alcoholic drink
[1:24:13] <+nocreditclear> Pat, I started playing FFXIV because of you. You're a time vampire.
[1:24:14] <yamikami13> @PeachSaliva Pat was not playing in Rank, all the Toxic people in League of Legend are in Sliver and Gold Rank.
[1:24:16] <duskrush> Are you going to finish Fallen Order on stream?
[1:24:17] <CrimsonFox777> BLASPHEMY
[1:24:18] <+IMDRanged> You'll play the Guy with the Second Nose
[1:24:19] <+GrayMatterMiner> boooo
[1:24:20] <%goose_attack_almanac> That's a good pick
[1:24:20] <simulationbard> DUNKMASTER
[1:24:22] <Ozavic> That's down right DARIUS
[1:24:23] <shiny_prinny> yeah darius
[1:24:23] <catwithsunglasses> Milk chocolate will make your bones srong Kappa
[1:24:23] <BlankKhun> Crack Headbutt sounds like a move Terry would do
[1:24:24] <Fancypants25> Did you like it?
[1:24:24] <tacostarvedbeast> wait when did u play league? and why?
[1:24:25] <Jetsfantasy> Darius is fun
[1:24:26] <honeyman18> 9 minutes per pound, oven bag, half power, and thaw it first
[1:24:26] <+DesertPenguin> Do you wish you could erase your memory of Outer Wilds and play it again?
[1:24:27] <+Taisuru> DUNKS
[1:24:29] <@Calek> I will never not think of King Darius from Veggietales
[1:24:30] <VritraReiRei> oh course he would LUL
[1:24:31] <+VantomPayne> to prepare for the League FTG?
[1:24:33] <+Tarage> Pat sing Elmo a song!
[1:24:34] <+Dr_DangerPhD> Pat is definitely a Teemo main Kappa
[1:24:34] <%superc37> reach has the best ending tho
[1:24:35] <%goose_attack_almanac> Darius gets fuckin nuts with his passive
[1:24:36] <%Ascethetic> why did you turn to the dark side?
[1:24:36] <%GraceTBM> fallen order is an offstream game
[1:24:37] <%Tyonidus> Friend tried to get me into league with him but I'm too unga to take losses, makes me too sad
[1:24:40] <UnfilteredComic> I really dislike playing against darius, but hes great
[1:24:43] <%a_wizard_in_space> Darius is strong and that bleed effect and finisher are great.
[1:24:45] <Oncamimus> Milk Chocolate causes the kidney stones for me ;_;
[1:24:47] <%PauliusMaximus> Darius makes me mad
[1:24:48] <%SoFarFetched> KEVIN CAME BACK TO HOTS TO DO THE HERO SPOTLIGHT FOR DEATHWING
[1:24:48] <%Tyonidus> Garen is my favorite though
[1:24:50] <shiny_prinny> CSing is very important in league
[1:24:50] <tacostarvedbeast> play dota instead
[1:24:52] <%goose_attack_almanac> Maps are larger
[1:24:53] <Ozavic> Pat should play the greatist stinky boi, Twitch
[1:24:55] <%cureneckbeard> Paige have you considered stream diapers
[1:24:59] <%Breakfast_Megapowers> its in a LEAGUE of its own
[1:24:59] <%a_wizard_in_space> plus you get to spam Dunk memes
[1:25:00] <dreamlandsfinest> Darius is the shit. Hell yeah
[1:25:04] <@Calek> I stopped playing league when matches averaged 30-45 minutes
[1:25:06] <+CaptainJax> Blitzcrank has a much better hook
[1:25:07] <MetroidSlayerP7> Halo? that shooter from '99? Is that still around?
[1:25:07] <Zombrocom> Dota would be even more stressful LUL
[1:25:11] <%psychodave1234> im gonna need to switch to myphone because i wanna play the death strandings
[1:25:15] <%Dhurkst> SCREM
[1:25:15] <+linSP> monster withdrawl
[1:25:21] <$GarbageNirvana> ayy
[1:25:22] <valriot> It's is you played LoL
[1:25:22] <+Dr_DangerPhD> in league if you die twice in laning phase the game is pretty much won already
[1:25:24] <$Solidnick18> noice
[1:25:25] <tacostarvedbeast> darius mains are just like riven mains, yuck
[1:25:27] <%galaxyswirl> have you thought about playing league again since the announced fighting game?
[1:25:30] <wondersloth07> did paige wash her hands?
[1:25:30] <%GraceTBM> Paige should do a killer match and Pat gives backseat tips
[1:25:33] <LeftOverPizza13> okie den
[1:25:35] <TurtlesAndTentacles> kiss her you idiot @peachsaliva
[1:25:36] <+XeroSigmaPrime> Ehhh the learning curve of Dota would destroy Pat
[1:25:38] <%a_wizard_in_space> oh man Blitz is a robot too so Pat would be into that.
[1:25:44] <+DesertPenguin> OH GOD ME TOO
[1:25:44] <+linSP> SHIT
[1:25:51] <%Tyonidus> @Dr_DangerPhD yeah that's just straight up unfun and way too stressful and high pressure to be enjoyable....
[1:25:51] <%SoFarFetched> Paige doesn't like playing killer.
[1:25:52] <%GraceTBM> fuck mine is real similar

[1:28:42] <+cereal_box_conspiracy> maybe he just likes ringing bells, don't judge
[1:28:47] <ZeeJiggle> Well it's like Predator invisibile
[1:28:51] <DesuDesuDokiDoki> what?
[1:28:52] <LGWPhanto> It's not total invisibility unless he stands still for a second.
[1:28:54] <Fien111> I mean, you can't see the killer 90% of the time anyway
[1:28:54] <ahegotrigger> you can also make it to where everyone hears your bell
[1:28:55] <%rdark_ksu> he is invisible not you
[1:28:57] <%LeonPup> you can kind of see him
[1:28:58] <DedlokPM> but he has a shimmer when cloaked
[1:29:04] <$GrugManGetAngryInside> He invisible... not blind
[1:29:04] <Mendin> It's like 95% invisibility
[1:29:06] <%Ascethetic> also, he has an add-on that makes him totally silent
[1:29:11] <%LeonPup> most Wraith have NOED
[1:29:17] <catwithsunglasses> Someone playing bing bong boi PogChamp
[1:29:18] <+logoth_> Bill!

[1:29:23] <%isolex_> Hello Mustard goblin and short goblin!
[1:29:29] <DedlokPM> @GrugManGetAngryInside she asked because The Spirit can't see survivors when she is invisible

[1:29:52] <+Taisuru> As in left 4 dead bill?
[1:29:53] <BurningLlama777> This Wraith is running wild
[1:29:55] <Mendin> Windstorm + Swift Hunter makes Wraith into a discount spirit giving him big cloaked movement speed
[1:29:56] <+lethallunacyx> It's not his fault
[1:29:57] <+InuOblivion> Omg
[1:30:03] <ahegotrigger> this is a good wraith
[1:30:05] <Fien111> Bills here

[1:30:34] <+InuOblivion> Run
[1:30:34] <DedlokPM> @GrugManGetAngryInside yup. she can still see blood scratches but she can't see the survivors while she is invisible
[1:30:34] <UnfilteredComic> Your perk went off you shoulda known
[1:30:37] <catwithsunglasses> The way to play wraith is to hope the survivors are potatoes
[1:30:37] <%AlatosDiogenes> Where's yo license!?
[1:30:38] <Valdorick> Laser focus on that killer
[1:30:39] <CriticKitten> That was legit spooky
[1:30:46] <prophetdisharmonious> wraith is a terrible killer
[1:30:48] <$MajorCrasher> @galaxyswirl wait how?
[1:30:56] <Rumbutt> 360's don't work
[1:30:58] <$Soaked_Circuits> Cheer100 Cheer100 Gave up on college and decided to go for trade school! Already an electrician due to military, but decided to specialize and go for working on wind turbines and other renewable energy sources. Will be nice to make a real wage soon, because currently I'm working as crew on a yacht and the pay is shit as well as being in the service industry for rich people, which is the absolute worst.
[1:31:02] <+linSP> doesnt serpentine cancel out the benefit of being faster because you're wasting distance
[1:31:03] <$GrugManGetAngryInside> @DedlokPM word up. I was hoping i could inspire Pat to slam her
[1:31:07] <%Ascethetic> hes a scrub stomper
[1:31:10] <+InuOblivion> 360’s been nerfed
[1:31:10] <MetroidSlayerP7> Elmo inspects keypresses
[1:31:21] <+DoktorZee> bill noooooooooo
[1:31:25] <%Gogogolem> I played against a hacker who, when he would swing you'd teleport infront of him.
[1:31:25] <ZeeJiggle> I mean a Killer's strength honestly doesn't come into play until you get way high up in the ranks
[1:31:25] <Mrbaconator> outWRAITHgous
[1:31:30] <Jarvanii> pat played league? I need to return to my own timeline
[1:31:32] <+DoktorZee> RUN
[1:31:36] <CriticKitten> LUL
[1:31:36] <%galaxyswirl> @PeachSaliva imagine playing against a wraith with the charm that removes the bing bong
[1:31:40] <ahegotrigger> LUL
[1:31:42] <prophetdisharmonious> if his bong was silent i think he'd be much better
[1:31:43] <NickNackProductions> that was swift
[1:31:43] <randomlatinoguy> LUL
[1:31:52] <%galaxyswirl> @MajorCrasher one add on removes it
[1:32:00] <%Gogogolem> yes hide next to a hook.
[1:32:03] <+TopTieramisu> LUL
[1:32:05] <%LeonPup> could just be slopppy butcher
[1:32:08] <$GarbageNirvana> That scream sounded like Pat\

[1:32:11] <+DoktorZee> F

[1:32:14] <Mendin> Wraith has a charm that makes the bing bong omnidirectional and everywhere
[1:32:16] <ahegotrigger> I mean sloppy butcher
[1:32:19] <+TopTieramisu> HEEEYAAAA
[1:32:19] <BurningLlama777> I'm not as familiar with the game; wouldn't be ideal to always try and recover / attempt escape?
[1:32:19] <Valdorick> Dang
[1:32:20] <%Gogogolem> i am gonna hide behind this explosive barrel in a gun fight says paige.
[1:32:25] <TheLordOfTheScrubs> No one will ever find me chilling out by the heavy-traffic death trap Kappa

[1:32:36] <Mendin> ie the nerfed anal beads for spirit
[1:32:40] <Fien111> Sloppy, but whole
[1:32:49] <BurningLlama777> Eyy, Steve
[1:32:52] <reddpop_> how is constant mashing fair to the player? just ruin your wrists
[1:32:54] <CrimsonFox777> Not the Creepy Sex Dungeon (TM)!
[1:32:54] <krymzen5> ...
[1:32:55] <DedlokPM> Thanks, Steve-Dave
[1:32:56] <+Taisuru> It looks like there's a ton of DLC for this game, is there no good way to get all of it in a bundle?
[1:33:00] <%galaxyswirl> @BurningLlama777 only has a 5% chance of working and makes the time on hook shorter
[1:33:04] <ZeeJiggle> @BurningLlama777 Recover on the ground, yes. Try to escape the hook, noooo. You have a very low chance of getting off the hook and it just quickens how fast you die on it
[1:33:13] <%Kenzo2000> Paige continues to stay by the hooms
[1:33:14] <BurningLlama777> Ah, gotcha. Thanks all
[1:33:30] <krymzen5> rip steve

[1:35:36] <DedlokPM> @Taisuru nope. only bundles they ever do is game+certain dlc, usually for popular properties. The the game and (usually) DLC goes on sale a lot so wait for the thanksgiving sale un the 26th
[1:35:39] <MetroidSlayerP7> or their mom calls them down to dinner
[1:35:43] <%Keyd00d> Don't play online with a bad connection
[1:35:43] <%worldbrand> no he's right
[1:35:44] <Rumbutt> RED BARS HAVE NO RIGHTS GET THE FUCK OUT
[1:35:44] <hntronium> barpartheid

[1:35:46] <@mistymntns> @PeachSaliva PRESTIGE COWARD
[1:35:50] <Mr_Strut> Get better internet, plebs
[1:35:52] <krymzen5> yeah, nothing's worse then getting in trouble in a fighter because you ran into a few people who rq in a row
[1:35:52] <%SoFarFetched> That's what overwatch does,fucks over people with bad connections LUL
[1:35:53] <+BuriasDempsey> Pat is right
[1:35:54] <hntronium> RED BARS RISE UP
[1:35:55] <%Binary_Fireball> a good system will have p2p register with a server and ping
[1:35:56] <DancePad_on_VHS> The red bar war
[1:35:56] <TikanZK> As someone with shit internet that disconnects all the time: don't play online games!
[1:35:58] <LeftOverPizza13> people with shitty connections ruin the experience for literally everyone
[1:35:58] <AMaidIndeed> REDS BARS GO HOME
[1:35:59] <ZeeJiggle> Well then you can use the penalty time to fix your connection.
[1:36:00] <reddpop_> I was playing SFV the other day and had a Ken DC when I hit him with a super. Felt like launch week
[1:36:02] <scrumbotime> Red Bars Get Sent To Mars
[1:36:03] <+Ilpala> better dead than red
[1:36:03] <DedlokPM> Patrick "The Bar goes red? Then you are dead" Boivin
[1:36:04] <THEREALCRYO16> go sub to cryo16 on youtube
[1:36:07] <%LeonPup> prestige is literally not worth it
[1:36:08] <+Dr_DangerPhD> If you have an unstable connection you're ruining everyones time, it sucks but thats the truth
[1:36:12] <Fien111> Red Bars UNI............*LOADING*.......
[1:36:13] <peachy996> Wifi can also go home
[1:36:14] <DrFaustMD> If you're a red bar get hit with my car
[1:36:15] <scrumbotime> If your connection is bad, get grounded by your dad
[1:36:15] <Rumbutt> Prestige is garbage
[1:36:18] <prophetdisharmonious> No one wants to play against someone with online connection on the same level of Plagues.
[1:36:21] <+TopTieramisu> Patrick "I meant buried!" Boivin
[1:36:22] <Mendin> only Claudette
[1:36:26] <peachy996> A cord is not expensive you jerks
[1:36:35] <+Risingxiv> Does that ugly sweater have good stats or are you just stuck with it?
[1:36:35] <+Taisuru> @DedlokPM Cool, also how is Ash? Probably the DLC I'd go for first
[1:36:36] <DesuDesuDokiDoki> Pat "If you have a Red Bar, I will run you over with my car" Boivan
[1:36:38] <Mendin> for the cloaking forms
[1:36:42] <Rumbutt> Are you gonna use the bloody clothes? No? then prestige is worthless
[1:36:50] <SummonerMagno> Hey Pat, are those sqirrels i hear?
[1:36:52] <peachy996> And you can macgyver a cord setup too
[1:36:53] <+DoktorZee> SPINE CHILL
[1:37:01] <+InuOblivion> @peachsaliva The perk Borrowed Time is really good for saving people of hooks When the killer is near
[1:37:03] <randomlatinoguy> No it's just a flex
[1:37:06] <HalloweenHangover> Better chance for rarer items
[1:37:07] <%LeonPup> blood doesn't work on custom cosmetics
[1:37:07] <ZeeJiggle> I mean blood clothes could help you blend in a little I guess??
[1:37:07] <BurningLlama777> Bloody Clothes is my favorite Castlevania track
[1:37:10] <%Kenzo2000> Get rid of Meg
[1:37:18] <+Dr_DangerPhD> Now that powerline adapters are sub $50 playing on wifi is inexcusable in any respect
[1:37:19] <Fien111> The purple one
[1:37:20] <%Sora20030c> get reid of WGLF
[1:37:20] <+zzNamttamzz> a little sneakier but they nerfed them
[1:37:21] <Ozavic> Urban Evasion

[1:37:30] <DesuDesuDokiDoki> big tiddies ( . ) . )
[1:37:32] <%SoFarFetched> Can't believe Paige is being toxic
[1:37:32] <+logoth_> Since Bill died in Left 4 Dead 2 it makes sense he's here
[1:37:37] <%LeonPup> Keep the we'll live forever for points
[1:37:41] <$GarbageNirvana> Chronic D/Cers should get thrown in matches where they just get randomly injured
[1:37:41] <%maskofmichael> Get rid of Pat
[1:37:45] <peachy996> wut
[1:37:51] <DedlokPM> @Taisuru I forget what his perks are, but after playing long enough the survivors are generally just skin because when you level them to a certain level you can use their unique perks on every survivor
[1:37:55] <+logoth_> Does Elmo have a tiny cheesecake
[1:37:57] <+DesertPenguin> Hey @PeachSaliva how do you feel about Jack Daniels?
[1:38:06] <+Taisuru> @DedlokPM Ah, cool
[1:38:15] <catwithsunglasses> get rid of self-care, the nerfs to healing make self-caring literally useless
[1:38:26] <Jonny_Uppercut> Paige do you play killer too or are you a survivor main?
[1:38:27] <ZeeJiggle> You could argue size and sound differences between survivors but eh
[1:38:30] <%omenzazu> Nea my girl... the showing me where killer is at perks are my favorite
[1:38:32] <APB_Harleqyn> For multiplayer games, the trick as a developer is penalizing for deliberate disconnects, and not someone losing internet or having com problems.
[1:38:39] <Rumbutt> Yeah, Self Care is bad now
[1:38:43] <+zzNamttamzz> the terrible voice acting is different between survivors
[1:38:43] <+DoktorZee> nancys perk inner strength is a good self care replacement if youre good at totem hunting
[1:38:52] <scrumbotime> If you've got red bars in a fighting game, I'll put your hands over open flame
[1:38:56] <DedlokPM> Yeah, the killers are more unique because they have unique abilities in addition to being able to share perks
[1:38:56] <Habblewater> If you fuck it up you feel like a bumblelord
[1:38:59] <%worldbrand> it's like leading a foursome
[1:39:05] <%AncelDeLambert> given how the survivors treat me, they don't think I'm a host
[1:39:10] <$GrugManGetAngryInside> no. Paige sets the pace for the game
[1:39:10] <shinichizio> Pat "If you prestige, I'll kick your knees" Boivin
[1:39:11] <ZeeJiggle> Survivor can be a lot more chill too
[1:39:17] <%maskofmichael> Does anyone in this game get a GUN?
[1:39:25] <DesuDesuDokiDoki> ice cream is the best <3
[1:39:26] <Rumbutt> Playing Killer will make you better at Survivor and vice versa
[1:39:27] <DedlokPM> It is time for WcDonald

[1:45:52] <+TopTieramisu> that burger is basically an ass
[1:45:52] <%Breakfast_Megapowers> Beef is Ass
[1:45:53] <TomFrank> ture
[1:45:53] <Fien111> People eat ass DRY, you coward
[1:45:54] <%FrogROOT> yeah dude
[1:45:54] <Snookasaurus> Im an ass eater from WAY back
[1:45:55] <TomFrank> true
[1:45:55] <+driemen> "oh no I'm two hours late to the stream! what'd I miss?" "oh its vvcdonalds time i see"
[1:45:55] <%SoFarFetched> @PeachSaliva They call it the Flying Dutchman at In N Out,except it's got cheese in between the burgers.
[1:45:55] <%ThePuddingDead> the fuck does that have anything to do with -
[1:45:55] <TwinBat> people eat THE WHOLE ass
[1:45:57] <%Zulrez> but thats wrong, the right way to eat mcdonolds is to make a big pool of ketchup pour pepper into it and then dip the burger into the pool of ketchup
[1:45:57] <Coystick> With a spoon baby
[1:45:57] <%rdark_ksu> this is like heresy and blasphemy had a baby behind a fast food dump
[1:45:58] <%psychodave1234> NO EATING ASS IS RAD, YOUR SHIT IS AN ABOMINATION
[1:45:59] <%maskofmichael> Where did Pat find you? I, too, wish to find a broken girlfriend
[1:46:00] <KingKZ> This is the most offensive thing I ever seen.
[1:46:01] <DigitalJoshie> fair enough
[1:46:01] <+steelmorrigan> Your burger is not the same as eating ass
[1:46:01] <%FrogROOT> i LOVE ass
[1:46:02] <+Estuko> @PeachSaliva What' like, your burger limit. I have this awful habit of eating 4 of the $1 cheeseburgers on my own and am trying for 5. It's like a drug.
[1:46:03] <+Dr_Mooose> yeah...no, no it's not
[1:46:03] <Mr_Strut> I wouldn't go so far as to call them "people"
[1:46:05] <%KingGoblodyte> WHAT'S WRONG WITH EATING ASS!?
[1:46:06] <ryderbootz> you think Pat would ever propose to you on stream?
[1:46:08] <Oncamimus> they eat da booty like groceries
[1:46:09] <%FrogROOT> ASS SHIT
[1:46:09] <Megaleg> people don't have a whole ritual for eating ass
[1:46:11] <+Taisuru> I only half ass
[1:46:13] <%CopperTucker> @PeachSaliva reminder to not eat ass with your eyes
[1:46:13] <baronvonkame> is paige eating corporate ass instead of licking corporate boots?
[1:46:15] <illustriouslangley> @peachsaliva for the love of god, we've been telling you for years just order the burger without the buns
[1:46:16] <jiin6> ass and mac donalds = same
[1:46:19] <%ryome> No ketchup in ass
[1:46:19] <BlankKhun> Remember that one guy that actually died of an infection from eating ass?
[1:46:20] <%Binary_Fireball> you ever choke while eating ass?
[1:46:21] <JoeStillLife> Emlo is stunned by the mcdonalds
[1:46:23] <%Tyonidus> STD's are what's wrong with it....
[1:46:24] <+InuOblivion> What is it called when you get a McDouble and you put a McChicken patty in the middle?
[1:46:26] <MetroidSlayerP7> If you want buns of steel, you trash the buns from the meal
[1:46:27] <Valdorick> Just remember to eat ass with protection.
[1:46:29] <%psychodave1234> WHY
[1:46:31] <Frostydough1> Paige this is the equivalant of eat not one but TWO ASS larxaLewd larxaLewd larxaLewd
[1:46:31] <Madbearv> you go to prison after you eat ass
[1:46:32] <missingangle> Please just don't add ketchup to ass pls
[1:46:35] <Coystick> Paige how can you say you love Pat when you won't even eat his ass?
[1:46:35] <%Breakfast_Megapowers> Won't eat ass, but would eat McDonalds
[1:46:37] <Psyramics> then everyone would know she's a weirdo
[1:46:37] <bleugh> why not just buy some ground beef and pickles from the store
[1:46:37] <Nina96> what about Pat would he eat ass?
[1:46:40] <%psychodave1234> YES THERE IS I PROMISE DUDE
[1:46:40] <%worldbrand> can you order a giant multi-patty burger?
[1:46:42] <%maskofmichael> Just make your own burger
[1:46:42] <jiin6> no one reads notes
[1:46:43] <+mh9s> this woman CANNOT be serious, they say
[1:46:46] <$MajorCrasher> I don't like the taste of poop particles

[1:46:58] <LORDSPOOKLEKINS> Dont put food in ***'s bad

[1:47:27] <%maskofmichael> Elmo seems confused.
[1:47:28] <Fien111> WcDonalds has a different flavor, though, since it's 90% beef filler matter and vege starch
[1:47:28] <+TopTieramisu> THIS ISN'T A BURGER ANYMORE
[1:47:28] <randomlatinoguy> PAIGE THIS IS A CRIME
[1:47:29] <count_bob> Hey Paige?

[1:47:30] <%worldbrand> LUL
[1:47:31] <%rdark_ksu> even though its just mcdonalds the fact the buns are getting tossed makes me unhappy
[1:47:31] <Megaleg> this is just a mcdonalds double down
[1:47:31] <Heartless_01> what the fuck!
[1:47:32] <prophetdisharmonious> this just happened right? I'm not going through deja vu?
[1:47:33] <ManOfReason> Lmao
[1:47:33] <santafer> Look, one of the earliest sightings of Paige with Pat was the whose ham sandwich debacle. You should know this.

[1:47:50] <BurningLlama777> @NickNackProductions I'd cook more often except my two roommates make it so I have to clean the entire kitchen every time I want to cook.
[1:47:51] <%worldbrand> paige is holding him back
[1:47:52] <Angry_Ev1L> mr streamer I don't feel so good
[1:47:53] <Fien111> Elmo looks down in SHAME

[1:48:51] <type_silly> Elmo really wants that ketchup
[1:48:51] <The_I_T_Guy> I'm a bit concerned that the mustard queen herself isn't dipping in mustard
[1:48:54] <$GarbageNirvana> ***
[1:48:54] <%cureneckbeard> Chew like you're chewing through a chair
[1:48:55] <%worldbrand> Paige is a hero. the devil is staying in hell because he doesn't want to deal with this. She's holding him back.
[1:48:56] <%rdark_ksu> @PeachSaliva Wendys lets ya get all the stuff wrapped in lettuce
[1:48:58] <+TopTieramisu> god regrets granting the gift of life after watching paige eat
[1:48:58] <Sunstalker> How the fuck are they supposed to put it together without the buns? vadeDERP I wouldn't ship it like that.

[1:49:37] <sc0rezer0> @sc0rezer0 is new here. Say hello! VoHiYo
[1:49:39] <%SoFarFetched> In N Out has a thing called the Flying Dutchman where it's two burger patties with cheese in between.
[1:49:40] <randomlatinoguy> But why tho?
[1:49:40] <@Calek> only McDonalds has worms
[1:49:41] <+Piemen99> !uptime
[1:49:41] <%a_wizard_in_space> @burningllama777 I mean in the growing capitalist hellscape we find ourselves in the only reliable protein will eventually be the McDonalds worms.
[1:49:48] <+lethallunacyx> I like the nuggets with bbq
[1:49:50] <DigitalJoshie> the bun is the weakest part of a mcDonald burger
[1:49:52] <$GarbageNirvana> @SoFarFetched Can you get that animal style?
[1:49:55] <%Kenzo2000> Lubbychudder
[1:49:55] <%skizzuto> lubby chudder
[1:49:56] <%cureneckbeard> Team Bread vs I'll Just Have the Meat
[1:49:56] <jiin6> like when the burger maker is around
[1:49:56] <prophetdisharmonious> Paige eating like this is the only thing holding back Nyx
[1:49:57] <TurtlesAndTentacles> I can't eat McDonald's. Makes me sick
[1:49:59] <cottentailking> Hello everyone
[1:50:02] <%SoFarFetched> @GarbageNirvana I think you can??
[1:50:03] <%Tyonidus> Elmo is actually the best I wish I could snuggle him he perfec
[1:50:05] <BurningLlama777> @a_wizard_in_space I do like me a good McSquirmy
[1:50:06] <%cureneckbeard> apatWink
[1:50:11] <%isolex_> @PeachSaliva You check for worms, but what about the pee on the outside bag
[1:50:13] <+lupinelass120> Emlo is an old baby
[1:50:14] <$GarbageNirvana> k cause I might be down for that
[1:50:16] <%Zulrez> can 'when you're streaming' be the special occasion when you correctly eat a burger(with buns) Kappa
[1:50:18] <Bogart4321> hooray you have your appetite back
[1:50:18] <BinaryShuffle> best friends FeelsBadMan
[1:50:19] <+TopTieramisu> howmever

[1:50:21] <baronvonkame> woman of culture I see
[1:50:21] <SociallyAwkwardToaster> jack in the box curly fries tho
[1:50:22] <%worldbrand> i actually prefer costco fries, does that count?
[1:50:23] <+Ranger_Boon> fair
[1:50:23] <Fien111> "I crawled to you in my own piss, Human, our relationship has a baseline that shall not be broken"
[1:50:24] <Coystick> Wait why discard the bun if you're eating the chips, I thought it was anit-carbs?
[1:50:24] <%FrogROOT> BURGER KING PATTIES ARE ASS
[1:50:25] <peachy996> McDicks is slipping on their fries
[1:50:25] <nevan0> yeah
[1:50:25] <Jrocy247> Burger King has better Buns too
[1:50:26] <%Tyonidus> I love Bacon King's man, I'm actually addicted
[1:50:27] <%Binary_Fireball> GRAVY
[1:50:28] <NickNackProductions> I feel absolutely the opposite of what you just said
[1:50:28] <MetroidSlayerP7> McD buns are meh. Bread is important.
[1:50:29] <TwinBat> wendys has better of both
[1:50:30] <graemecrackers1> @PeachSaliva you looking extra fancy tonight
[1:50:32] <SoySocks> I like curly fries more, like Arby's, but i don't care for roast beef sandwiches
[1:50:33] <+nocreditclear> pee can be greasy if you try hard enough
[1:50:36] <catwithsunglasses> just keep asking them to not have the buns until they learn
[1:50:39] <illustriouslangley> mcdonalds boils their fries in the same crack sugar they put in their soda fountain
[1:50:40] <prophetdisharmonious> Excuse you, Chickfila has the best fries
[1:50:46] <sc0rezer0> Mc Doogies or Bwerger King
[1:50:46] <eiightbiitt> In N Out Protein style burgers are the best!
[1:50:50] <cameron1ooo1> Wendy’s is king in my heart.
[1:50:52] <garbageheaphound> why do people do this to there kids
[1:50:54] <%a_wizard_in_space> Gotta piss on the bag to keep the King outta your burgers.
[1:50:56] <%SoFarFetched> @FrogROOT Yeah Burger King changed the recipe of their fries and style of it
[1:50:57] <%cureneckbeard> that's not worms, that's gaslighting your kid
[1:50:59] <%FrogROOT> forsenS
[1:51:02] <%Ion_Laser> Five Guys has the best fries
[1:51:03] <wsintai> Yet
[1:51:04] <TwinBat> you want them futurama worms tho
[1:51:06] <illustriouslangley> if mcdicks made waffle fries .....
[1:51:06] <scottishwolf> You people make me feel worryingly sane.
[1:51:13] <BurningLlama777> @Ion_Laser Word.
[1:51:13] <jiin6> what happens when the patties are worms?
[1:51:16] <LORDSPOOKLEKINS> I once found a worm in a ritz cracker packet.I haven't eaten them since.That worm fear is REAL
[1:51:20] <krymzen5> my dad told me honeybuns frostings were made of toejam and i'm still scarred of them
[1:51:20] <%isolex_> does anyone have that comic with worms in a bottle of mustard
[1:51:21] <peachy996> Paige I got the worms rumor too but I knew it as lies where you took it to heart

[1:51:33] <$Soaked_Circuits> I want to see the burger bun redemption ark. If they are good quality it makes the burger better.
[1:51:34] <+gupple_> what happens when you do find a worm?
[1:51:35] <+nocreditclear> Impossible Burger is worms
[1:51:36] <@Calek> my aunt told me tomato seeds were frog eggs first time I ate them, and now I hate tomatoes
[1:51:37] <SociallyAwkwardToaster> @Ion_Laser gotta be the cajun fries, their regular fries are meh
[1:51:39] <%Binary_Fireball> nemotoads exist
[1:51:41] <BlankKhun> As long as you don't find a bee in your sub
[1:51:42] <nevan0> lil elmo
[1:51:47] <Fien111> Gaslighting kids under 10 is fucking great and my niece is sadly too smart to fall for ANYTHING. It's a shame
[1:51:47] <sc0rezer0> Is elmo a girl or boy?
[1:51:50] <prophetdisharmonious> maybe she misremembered pink slime as pink worms.
[1:51:52] <+Tarage> ***

[1:53:05] <KingyoNingyo> ELMO
[1:53:07] <baronvonkame> paige did I dream it or did I see something about you moving away?
[1:53:10] <Oncamimus> You just got bigger and strongerer
[1:53:12] <cameron1ooo1> Maybe you should keep the worms in for extra proteins
[1:53:12] <randomlatinoguy> Brush Elmo BibleThump
[1:53:17] <%a_wizard_in_space> that's also mostly protein, and carbs too so hey you got some energy bits!
[1:53:20] <+Tarage> BRUSH ELMO
[1:53:23] <%isolex_> pet the baby! BibleThump
[1:53:25] <%SoFarFetched> Elmo needs his brushes Paige
[1:53:29] <%ThePuddingDead> @PeachSaliva Thats almost becoming a war cry for ya
[1:53:31] <nevan0> HES WAITING
[1:53:32] <Oncamimus> Poor Peepee no brushies
[1:53:33] <%cureneckbeard> PET BABY apatGib
[1:53:36] <prophetdisharmonious> when will they let the killer hang out with the survivors near the fire?
[1:53:43] <catwithsunglasses> i got a stomach bug a week ago and got so nauseous and lost my entire appetite, everything tasted like ass so I now somewhat understand your pain
[1:53:44] <bigtroggjohn> The stream is about eating food if you think about it. The Entity is just hungy.
[1:53:44] <%isolex_> PET BABA
[1:53:47] <%SoFarFetched> YOU PROMISED BRUSHES FOR ELMO AFTER FOOD
[1:53:48] <@Calek> where did Pat go, did he pass out
[1:53:51] <sc0rezer0> Elmo desires something. Perhaps a pat?
[1:53:53] <%SoFarFetched> yeah he said he was really tired
[1:53:58] <%ThePuddingDead> @PeachSaliva You see a survivor on a hook you just shout from the hilltops, BALLS IN MY ASS! as you charge in for the rescue
[1:53:59] <prophetdisharmonious> Pat went into the closet
[1:54:01] <$Soaked_Circuits> Did she read any donations?
[1:54:06] <Oncamimus> Pat died
[1:54:08] <Fien111> It's weird how they keep people nutritional facts based on a 2000 calorie diet when that's way lower than most people need. Is that just the officer worker's calorie needs or something?
[1:54:09] <%Tyonidus> FULLSCREEN IT
[1:54:11] <%AlatosDiogenes> Elmo looking all pretty.
[1:54:12] <shinichizio> catonRIP

[1:57:11] <42nfl19> @PeachSaliva So mixed breed dogs are usually called mutts, what are mixed cat breeds called?
[1:57:12] <baronvonkame> found in a dumpster is how you find a lot of things, your boots, your cat...
[1:57:16] <Habblewater> Bargin is a good thing
[1:57:17] <%SoFarFetched> My cat adopted us by running up to us while we were coming home.

[1:57:42] <%KingGoblodyte> Compliments from hookers?
[1:57:43] <+Tarage> @PeachSaliva Are the compliments from hobos?
[1:57:43] <Klarrann3> tom cats?
[1:57:49] <%SoFarFetched> THOSE WERE THE NICEST BOOTS IT MADE ME CONSIDER WEARING THEM
[1:57:53] <type_silly> is it the same dumpster you found Pat
[1:57:54] <bigtroggjohn> When you think about it DBD is just the Entity’s Muckbang stream.

[1:57:59] <Nox_ludicro> @PeachSaliva apparently seing ranks of randos is a bug that's getting fixed. :\
[1:58:02] <+Tarage> I like how we all had the same idea.
[1:58:10] <%Tyonidus> @Klarrann3 THAT'S the term i was trying to think of
[1:58:11] <Oncamimus> Pat was trying to eat the boots

[1:58:55] <type_silly> kill her
[1:59:01] <Jonny_Uppercut> Beat her up Paige!
[1:59:01] <baronvonkame> you'd probably have to do like a patreon or something?
[1:59:03] <%king_wragles> @PeachSaliva punch her in the baby!
[1:59:04] <prophetdisharmonious> all alley cats/dogs are required by law to be able to sing 'why should i worry?' from oliver and company.

[2:01:48] <BurningLlama777> I wish I'd gone to trade school.
[2:01:50] <@Calek> I work in a dirt factory!
[2:01:56] <+steelmorrigan> Trades are a legit industry that need people
[2:01:56] <$Soaked_Circuits> Yes!!
[2:01:56] <$GarbageNirvana> I'm technically doing a trade school thing right now, going for Cisco network stuff
[2:01:57] <krymzen5> college is def not for everyone. hell its not for most. people push it too much
[2:02:11] <HazelnutBagel> honestly a plumber could charge whatever they wanted,just make the poop go down
[2:02:11] <+TheBigO75> Fair warning: Whatever you pick as your trade is going to take over your life.
[2:02:11] <%Tyonidus> college SUCC
[2:02:12] <Heartless_01> i tried the electrician route. i absolutely hated it FeelsBadMan
[2:02:15] <%a_wizard_in_space> It's also a skill that will always be necessary
[2:02:16] <Oncamimus> I wish i could go back :/
[2:02:16] <riiloseah> im a cosmetology student its fucking dope
[2:02:18] <$GarbageNirvana> I...might be too stupid for it but idk
[2:02:19] <Megaleg> it's because society looks down on jobs like plumbing and the like
[2:02:20] <Faustgesicht> Going to trade school right now for welding
[2:02:20] <TikanZK> Real talk in alot of trades if youre a girl you gotta put up with a lot of shit though LUL
[2:02:23] <%GraceTBM> so you could TRADE your clown college degree for a trade certificate?
[2:02:24] <baronvonkame> what'd you major in?
[2:02:24] <+mgskomododragon> My high school fellated the shit out of getting a university education to the extent where i thought i wouldnt make it without one
[2:02:31] <%Ell1ot> electricians and plumbers are usually the stars of those videos that i like
[2:02:31] <cherubs_anonymous> Academia is a fucking cancer
[2:02:34] <%DRCrosston> I got an interactive multimedia degree at a two year school.
[2:02:34] <%PauliusMaximus> isnt collage like a cultural norm in the US like your pressured heavily to go?
[2:02:36] <BurningLlama777> @krymzen5 I was going to be "the first one in the family to go to college." :( So I went to college to make them proud of me.
[2:02:37] <Oncamimus> spent too much time in the wrong major :/
[2:02:37] <%a_wizard_in_space> folks're always gonna need plumbers and welders.
[2:02:41] <krymzen5> i hated college, but my roomate sucked ass
[2:02:41] <illustriouslangley> got a 200k degree, my husband got his GED, he makes more than double what I do
[2:02:53] <%SoFarFetched> @PauliusMaximus Mainly universities are the you NEED to go to because peer pressure.

[2:03:10] <krymzen5> @BurningLlama777 same. i was forced into it by my fiance at the time and parents
[2:03:10] <$ShootThatZombie> i wish I'd gone to trade school instead. I went to college for four years and now I owe $37k and have a degree in something Im no longer interested in
[2:03:13] <illustriouslangley> his tuition was 0
[2:03:17] <$Soaked_Circuits> I start classes for welding in a few months as well!
[2:03:17] <42nfl19> I wish I tried better in engineering college, but now I have a stable job with benefits so I find that it was worth it on my part. Now I am getting my masters paid for from my work.
[2:03:19] <%maskofmichael> Got a degree in Graphic Design, work as a Cashier.

[2:03:33] <SociallyAwkwardToaster> went to college for a creative writing degree, now i work at a walgreens :') i had a good time but i kinda wish i had done something different
[2:03:35] <%Tyonidus> All public school including high school was a complete and total breeze for me, never even studied which was aweseome....buuuuut I never learned HOW to study...then the crappy community college I went to wanted us to basically teach ourselves and read the textbooks ourselves while they taught a course entirely different from that....
[2:03:39] <prophetdisharmonious> Pat makes everyone taller by comparison Kappa
[2:03:40] <%cureneckbeard> abipopSNACK
[2:03:43] <%SoFarFetched> Does that mean I have a chance with paige if I'm slightly taller than her LUL
[2:03:44] <Fien111> Welders make BANK, but apparently all my welder friends say the market is concentrated is wierdly specific areas

[2:03:57] <%GraceTBM> chinese food dog
[2:03:58] <+mgskomododragon> community college was a 3rd the price what i paid at university and i was able to clear my debt with the x ray job i got at community college
[2:04:00] <+steelmorrigan> Pineapples
[2:04:04] <$Soaked_Circuits> My tuition will be zero as well do to GI benefits!
[2:04:05] <CrimsonFox777> People think Paige is tall because Pat is really short in comparison.
[2:04:06] <BurningLlama777> This is a feel good stram
[2:04:06] <Wan6Saber> public schools are trash, and should be replaced
[2:04:06] <%maskofmichael> Bacon is gross and wrong
[2:04:08] <bevyrage> the reason why trade school is so much cheaper than college tuition is because kennedy wrote a bill to jack up college tuition in order to persuade kids from going into college courses specifically so then trade schools don't have to adopt to a new format
[2:04:10] <Oncamimus> dawww
[2:04:11] <Jrocy247> WOOOF

[2:04:23] <%SoFarFetched> She's gotta assert dominance with her heels.
[2:04:24] <krymzen5> @BurningLlama777 at least our unnecessary student debt will comfort us lol doodBro
[2:04:26] <+cereal_box_conspiracy> I thought you were tall, but Pat is just short.
[2:04:30] <+conradical> i'm 5'6" and i thought i was short
[2:04:30] <missingangle> College is pushed too much as an expectation for everyone after high school. I try not to regret it but the debt sucks dude, big time. Especially since I switches majors and had to go an extra year
[2:04:37] <BurningLlama777> @Wan6Saber I don't know maybe if schools got more than a $2100 budget a year...
[2:04:37] <SulfurousAcid> two claudettes lol
[2:04:39] <%tinyswampthing> @PeachSaliva a former dota wrold champion team formedtheir new organization and named it "nigma" im not lying about this. i cant stop laughing

[2:04:47] <+steelmorrigan> at 6'4" ..not many tower on me.
[2:04:53] <missingangle> I'm Pat height that's weird
[2:04:56] <BurningLlama777> @krymzen5 Did you know that not even declaring bankruptcy can erase student debt! It's true!
[2:05:01] <%Aztec50> Peach has tall energy
[2:05:04] <%GraceTBM> does that mean pat is always filming his dick
[2:05:12] <Wan6Saber> @BurningLlama777 budget isn't an issue, it's the adminstration that ruins everything, in this bureaucratic system
[2:05:17] <Fien111> Pat just zooms the camera in
[2:05:17] <%cureneckbeard> he is big of heart
[2:05:18] <+conradical> it's the orb that's larger than life
[2:05:18] <%SoFarFetched> AND THAAAT MAKES YOU LARGER THAN LIFE
[2:05:20] <%GraceTBM> pat's larger IN life?

[2:05:32] <+Estuko> monkaS His presence is strong, heavy, the pressure
[2:05:33] <thehashslingingslashers> The story of pat is a tall one
[2:05:36] <$GarbageNirvana> He's like a yappy dog that has to be loud to get noticed
[2:05:36] <illustriouslangley> hes danny devito
[2:05:36] <%GraceTBM> And Paige has lantern jaw dick personality
[2:05:37] <Jolly_Adventurer> Big dick, tiny child
[2:05:40] <%Keyd00d> Pat walks with purpose
[2:05:41] <RushUnplugged> PAt is tripod confirmed
[2:05:41] <MasterCosmic> Not big. Tall dick energy LUL
[2:05:43] <Fien111> Tall dick implies it goes above some people's HEADS
[2:05:55] <%KingGoblodyte> Why does that preschool have barb wire fences???

[2:05:58] <%a_wizard_in_space> I know a guy like that. I'm 6'3" and I've got a friend that's like 5'5" who feels so much bigger than me.
[2:05:59] <%GraceTBM> you should really unplug those pussy christmas lights, they're a fire hazard
[2:05:59] <CrimsonFox777> He's condensed, concentrated into a single angry mass
[2:06:01] <42nfl19> You don't like the gamer cube @PeachSaliva ?
[2:06:03] <%SoFarFetched> oh it's the huntress
[2:06:04] <+steelmorrigan> oh shit huntress
[2:06:05] <MrLittleSam> he's actually 5 2 when he lays down too Kappa
[2:06:09] <BurningLlama777> These places would be fun to explore. Without, y'know, the killers and hooks and spider gods.
[2:06:11] <Coystick> SHE LOOMING

[2:06:30] <%GraceTBM> and her responsibilites
[2:06:35] <%SoFarFetched> @sc0rezer0 you fix generators to activate the exit while avoiding the killer and not dying.

[2:08:24] <%Gogogolem> I hear the sounds of a boomer suffering.
[2:08:44] <illustriouslangley> I am glad I'm not the only one that just says fuck my ass when upset
[2:08:50] <+steelmorrigan> purest bait

[2:13:36] <Frogwash> You closed the distance towards the killer instead of gaining it again.
[2:13:39] <%SoFarFetched> she gotta juke and jive
[2:13:39] <studleydoorite> @BurningLlama777 do you understand now
[2:13:39] <DracaenaLeaf> Paige jukes like that sometimes

[2:14:06] <%SoFarFetched> @sc0rezer0 It's not AI,another player plays as the killer
[2:14:07] <+FoolsArcade> I am very familiar with the game, and if they got their back to you you should run the math away
[2:14:08] <bigtroggjohn> Paige, I love ya, but that juke-game. Bruh.
[2:14:13] <prophetdisharmonious> We wouldn't understand. Paige was ten steps ahead the entire time.
[2:14:14] <Fien111> Probably no, it's not a huge game so most folks don't know
[2:14:26] <krymzen5> 4d chess i see

[2:14:45] <+steelmorrigan> this is a good killer too
[2:14:46] <+lethallunacyx> Stop paigesplaining to me

[2:15:20] <thehashslingingslashers> I'm not tryin to be an ass but if you get better at running and looping places you can wait the killers time more
[2:15:23] <%SoFarFetched> she sleeps all night and she works all day
[2:15:30] <%PauliusMaximus> she has 5 axes and she had just refilled
[2:15:32] <Hellarussian> she says "uh oh stinky"

[2:15:43] <DracaenaLeaf> Hyea
[2:15:53] <Mendin> she admits that she is not good at game
[2:15:53] <SociallyAwkwardToaster> too bad she's dead forever now

[2:19:00] <%Blargimazombie> How about the okay lance?
[2:19:06] <%SoFarFetched> @shabop weapon in Dark Souls
[2:19:08] <SulfurousAcid> She's always humming Paige
[2:19:09] <Shonen_hero> when will Bill wield the spear of destiny
[2:19:09] <%QueequegTheater> @PeachSaliva Okay but Pat is straight up wrong about levels, if you're going to use heavy weapons like the Greatsword, you'll need to get your Vigor to at least 30
[2:19:10] <krymzen5> Paige needs big sword tho
[2:19:13] <Mendin> the Lance is good, but the Smelter Hammer is best
[2:19:19] <Fien111> Just have a shirt that says "SPITE"
[2:19:20] <%QueequegTheater> So you can tank
[2:19:23] <sc0rezer0> How long do these games usually go for?
[2:19:24] <Coystick> What about the STAND LANCE?
[2:19:33] <%SoFarFetched> these matches can be quick depending.
[2:19:35] <thehashslingingslashers> that's the dumpster elmo use to live in
[2:19:36] <prophetdisharmonious> The chicken wing is for filthy casuals
[2:19:36] <+conradical> paige is the epitome of glass cannon tho
[2:19:47] <DracaenaLeaf> byebye
[2:19:52] <%Ell1ot> they went to space hell
[2:19:53] <+conradical> so much a glass cannon that she consumes the glass
[2:20:08] <Oncamimus> yum...glass
[2:20:12] <Copperama> player 4 would not stop getting caught
[2:20:20] <illustriouslangley> the glass, much like the poison, is fuel
[2:20:20] <Mendin> Smelter Hammer is just a colossal iron chicken wing, it needs like 55 strength, it is larger than you are. It is The Biggest And Strongest In The Franchise
[2:20:20] <%SoFarFetched> yeah you can't do much against that
[2:20:21] <%QueequegTheater> No
[2:20:23] <DracaenaLeaf> Nope

[2:20:46] <Zaphire_Saucypants> christmas music is okay
[2:20:46] <illustriouslangley> No @peachsaliva because I'm not a heathen
[2:20:50] <ryderbootz> that one that gets me is Padoru

[2:23:39] <thehashslingingslashers> @PeachSaliva since you like to crouch alot maybe you should focus on making a really good Gen-Jockey build, or be more of a killer aggro build to distract then hide
[2:23:45] <Fien111> The Claudette Redemption Arc
[2:23:46] <@Calek> @QueequegTheater save it for the ds2 streams
[2:23:49] <SGrim> Spoken like a survivor main

[2:28:53] <+whiskey_wolfe_> Goodnight Moon
[2:28:54] <%a_wizard_in_space> I always try to play out scenes in my head to tire my brain out. Might help.
[2:28:57] <shabop> heather feather's videos insta put me to sleep

[2:29:09] <%a_wizard_in_space> Nice dodge!
[2:29:10] <Nina96> sometimes it is though
[2:29:10] <illustriouslangley> I fall asleep to the sounds of ur mum after I give her big cummies
[2:29:10] <Shonen_hero> I been looking at some ambient sound music like rain fall and as a Washingtonian all my life it comforts me
[2:29:11] <%QueequegTheater> @prophetdisharmonious The only hard rules are faint = death, 1 mon per area, and name all catches. I always include no trades and TrainerID determines starter (last number: 1-3 = grass 4-6 = fire 7-9 = water, 0 is player's choice)
[2:29:12] <+Splatterfest> do you love being their scape goat
[2:29:13] <DigitalJoshie> asmr can be very wholesome and relaxing
[2:29:13] <Jrocy247> It's ear porn
[2:29:14] <+cereal_box_conspiracy> I love porn, I love ASMR, but there's nothing vaguely sexual about ASMR to me.
[2:29:14] <+Estuko> Pat listening to the sound of a controller being wiped down with alcohol wipes asmr
[2:29:17] <Faustgesicht> Some lady speaks finnish and i fucking pass out
[2:29:18] <simulationbard> Some of it is totally porn tho
[2:29:19] <+linSP> paige just say fall asleep and everyone in chat will sleep like a baby
[2:29:21] <shinichizio> It's not always porn. There's nothing pornographic about sorting M&Ms.
[2:29:27] <Fien111> ASMR makes me SUPER PISSED for some reason. I've learned that's a somewhat common reaction which made me feel less weird about it
[2:29:29] <%KingGoblodyte> @PeachSaliva I put on 2 to 3 hour long Japanese metro train go-pro videos
[2:29:29] <sosandstorm> nice bob and weave there

[2:29:44] <%Tyonidus> Nah there's legit real good asmr that doesn't involve some chick with a push up bra with her chest up in the camera, just have to not be a ding dong and actually look for two seconds....
[2:29:54] <shabop> @Faustgesicht WhiteWinterWhispers?
[2:29:56] <benjiFG> asmr is neato

[2:30:29] <Redmannasah> My boi Ephemeral rift is my sleep aid
[2:30:31] <%Tyonidus> I'm a dude and girl voice asmr doesn't really help me sleep a lot., as weird as it is, I find men's voices more relaxing.
[2:30:34] <%isolex_> MST
[2:30:34] <%Ion_Laser> You damn youths and your Jonah
[2:30:36] <%isolex_> IS SO GOOD
[2:30:37] <%QueequegTheater> @SulfurousAcid that's a bad idea unless you have zero alternatives. Chemically induced sleep is super low quality
[2:30:38] <shinichizio> RiffTrax is even on twitch!
[2:30:39] <californaya> I loved MST3K as a kid, now I can't watch it becuase I hate people talking over movies :v
[2:30:41] <Fien111> My 8 year old niece is binge watching the series. It's fucking universal
[2:30:43] <%DRCrosston> I watch the Star Force episodes to sleep.
[2:30:45] <VirtuaRailith> Rowsdower, Zap Rowsdower
[2:30:54] <MadDesperado13> I wonder if theres beer on the sun
[2:30:55] <+XeroSigmaPrime> Take Melatonin!... after consulting a doctor when taking other meds

[2:30:58] <%ryome> I used to listen to mbmbam bits on YouTube
[2:30:59] <Oncamimus> my favorite mst3k is Final Justice
[2:31:01] <californaya> RLM is my preferred method of shitting on movies now
[2:31:04] <prophetdisharmonious> JOI is literally an acronym for jerk off instructions. it's implicitly pornographic.
[2:31:10] <SirBrawler18> Recently started playing this recently. Survivor is very fun
[2:31:12] <%psychodave1234> they both got that good deep voice

[2:31:40] <VirtuaRailith> Nothing beats Final Sacrifice
[2:31:42] <WaitHowDidIGetHere> @PeachSaliva Is there a word you would use to describe MST3K, perhaps pertaining to how much "skin" it features?
[2:31:45] <%QueequegTheater> Watch the Bloodborne Playthrough Kappa
