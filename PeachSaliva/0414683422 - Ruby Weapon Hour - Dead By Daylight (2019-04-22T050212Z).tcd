[0:40:41] <%Doctor_Death_Bed> in some way Paige is a tiddy streamer because people only come to watch her talk and have her read their questions instead of playing a game. Paige just doesn't even need to show the tiddy to be successful at it

[0:44:40] <%Breakfast_Megapowers> Winner winner chicken dinner
[0:44:41] <mankeyfight> This really seems like I game I'd have a hard time playing by myself
[0:44:42] <PartyForSorrying> Toxic
[0:44:45] <+Binary_Fireball> @PeachSaliva dijon, grey poupon, or heinz?
[0:44:46] <%dtd63> ya @Ignitus95
[0:44:46] <%starotter70> I can't believe Paige is so unsportsman like
[0:44:49] <BayowolfTerra> Youre fine, no butt dance
[0:44:49] <@commanderclaw> "Forgive me monster of death and destruction"
[0:44:49] <Run44forrest> Toxic
[0:44:50] <morbidmanny> still made it tho!
[0:44:51] <+Dagman72> TOXIC PAIGE
[0:44:51] <Plutt_bug> sure...
[0:44:55] <IminyourBase> paige as a mcdonalds diplomat you must not taunt the foreigns
[0:44:57] <%Puppet88> it aint toxic if your arent teabagging non stop
[0:44:58] <%Mr_Kalamari> FRENCH'S MUSTARD
[0:44:59] <%cervidaequus> sumimascuse me
[0:45:00] <Megaleg> So sorry killer she says
[0:45:00] <%GabeSweetMan> "Sorry person trying to murder me."
[0:45:02] <televisedrevolting> Paige is PROBLEMATIC
[0:45:03] <$ac262> Really liked this episode, but I’m a big Jaime fanboy so yeah
[0:45:06] <BayowolfTerra> Miniscule points
[0:45:18] <+Dagman72> GG TOO EAZY
[0:45:26] <goombella> I hate when people do that. I could already be in another match!
[0:45:30] <%Breakfast_Megapowers> How can Paige be so toxic? "Sorry" and "Pardon me"? DISGUSTING
[0:45:36] <jaguaress115> Do you play killer?
[0:45:39] <%JaydenSai> Right? GROSS
[0:45:46] <TheChillRoom> That classic Canadian apologetic toxicity
[0:45:47] <+fatal_penguin_> Dany is turning evil tho
[0:45:49] <RileyOMalley> nyelloo
[0:45:59] <nmaten> killer is scarier than survivor in this game
[0:46:01] <$ac262> Feel I’m like the only one who doesn’t like the new empowered arya tho
[0:46:08] <mankeyfight> How does killer freak you out?
[0:46:11] <%Breakfast_Megapowers> Is there a Mutant as a killer?
[0:46:15] <%starotter70> It freak you out to be the one scaring people?
[0:46:21] <DesuDesuDokiDoki> its frustrating
[0:46:22] <$ac262> Wasn’t Dany always kinda evil tho?
[0:46:24] <+MeowFyre> hi paige hope ur havin a good night
[0:46:25] <%JaydenSai> @PeachSaliva I feel like being Killer sets the match pace, and that scares me
[0:46:28] <%JaydenSai> Yeah yeah
[0:46:29] <nmaten> it used to be at least when the game was newer cause of the jank
[0:46:33] <SpaceGuntank> its more fun to play survivor, killer is so much more difficult
[0:46:33] <%dtd63> its more of an anxeity when you play killer
[0:46:34] <benjiFG> you are the kill
[0:46:35] <%starotter70> Fair enough
[0:46:43] <%Doctor_Death_Bed> @PeachSaliva so it's like being the GM in a DnD game, it's all on you and it's kinda scary
[0:46:44] <$HarraceHarrison> Easiest way to take off that pressure; facecamp the first guy you find
[0:46:45] <$Kataguro> Paige doesn't want to DM
[0:46:53] <nmaten> survivors infinite looping still gives me nightmares
[0:46:57] <%Mr_Kalamari> Just like how I give over Jump Master every time I get it in Apex
[0:47:00] <BayowolfTerra> It can be stressful and embarrassing if you fail
[0:47:05] <%dtd63> Im a killer maain though, I love it
[0:47:06] <IminyourBase> i want to shit my pants in fear not shit my pants because my tummy hurts
[0:47:14] <$ac262> You can tell a lot about a person when things don’t go there way and Dany has never handled it well
[0:47:22] <%Breakfast_Megapowers> I think a Mutant, Crazy Whaler or the literal Haunted Forest would make for a great killer
[0:47:24] <$Sphincter_Spelunker> I love Eli
[0:47:29] <televisedrevolting> So it's like being the host of a sick ass gala.
[0:47:29] <Run44forrest> had a jumpmaster drop us off the map in apex
[0:47:30] <$Sphincter_Spelunker> oh that Plague
[0:47:31] <+Ascethetic> Doctor main here!
[0:47:34] <BayowolfTerra> I say as a killer main
[0:47:39] <%starotter70> Yeah, he makes good videos
[0:47:40] <limeyprick> new setup ay
[0:47:42] <%dtd63> @PeachSaliva Hag, but I play a lot of billy and wraith too
[0:47:46] <$AgentTexes> Yeah, Vommy Mommy is pretty fun.
[0:47:48] <%Faustgesicht> @PeachSaliva Used Ash yet?
[0:47:49] <$HarraceHarrison> Even though it's not usually useful, I love puking on all the objects around me
[0:47:52] <+Lost_Zombie> As much as I hate clowns irl I main him in dbd
[0:48:01] <IminyourBase> paige, name a killer you want to see
[0:48:01] <+fatal_penguin_> Im just hoping Dany gets hers in the end
[0:48:01] <%Mr_Kalamari> Those jump masters are wack. you're supposed to drop people off on the mountains while you continue to fall on the loot
[0:48:04] <@commanderclaw> Eli is a good man, I'd marry my daughter to that good ol kentucky boy
[0:48:06] <$Kataguro> Hag, aka Spaghett
[0:48:10] <BayowolfTerra> I main daddy Myers
[0:48:19] <%starotter70> Gonna have to get to bed soon, night guys
[0:48:23] <%dtd63> Ash's new perk is infuriating lol
[0:48:24] <SpaceGuntank> maximum jumpscares
[0:48:26] <+Ascethetic> @PeachSaliva thoughts on doctor?
[0:48:30] <SirSmudgey> @PeachSaliva Have you watched the dbd endgame collapse trailer?
[0:48:30] <$ac262> I think she will at it will be Dany’s own fault
[0:48:33] <Scarnehu> @peachsaliva somewhat honest/kinda meme question: thoughts on a wickerman killer with a bee helmet?
[0:48:36] <DesuDesuDokiDoki> peach vs women
[0:48:39] <televisedrevolting> Oh he in?
[0:48:43] <benjiFG> Frames have been good for a while
[0:48:45] <TimCoPlays> TOO MANY COOKS

[0:49:44] <mankeyfight> Pack tactics at work right there
[0:49:46] <televisedrevolting> So relaxing this game is.
[0:49:46] <+MeowFyre> paige I got up for 30 seconds to pet my cat how are you on a hook already
[0:49:49] <$Mendin> 2 lb/week is the usual average/healthy number I've heard
[0:49:50] <$Sphincter_Spelunker> @Shindeil a year. 6-8 if you're boot camp
[0:49:54] <$HarraceHarrison> And on the third hook, Dwight rose again
[0:49:59] <%Breakfast_Megapowers> @PeachSaliva Anybody you'd like as a killer?
[0:50:00] <BayowolfTerra> how funny if he's got discordance?
[0:50:03] <%Reaped_Psyche> Can you actually escape the hook if you click hard enough or is it just to increse drama?
[0:50:13] <%cervidaequus> @shindeil depends on starting weight and methods. consult a professional if worried. Id give it 5lbs per month
[0:50:14] <$AgentTexes> You're a pro at juking into the killer, Paige.
[0:50:16] <%dtd63> If they chase your teamates, they aren't chasing you
[0:50:16] <%mayorrev> aww
[0:50:20] <%mayorrev> good frens
[0:50:23] <mankeyfight> So wholesome
[0:50:24] <DesuDesuDokiDoki> lewd
[0:50:25] <RadSuit> Wow, nice people online? How'd that happen?
[0:50:30] <$Kataguro> Poindexter and his ladies
[0:50:36] <+Zulos_> @shindeil i lost 60 in around 6 months via the keto diet, dont know what method you're going for though
[0:50:36] <RileyOMalley> look at that TEAMWORK
[0:50:37] <+NightOwlSam> man, it's been a while since i could catch Paige's streams. New location?
[0:50:39] <+SWindleFeD> Such teamwork, much thank
[0:50:40] <ChefRishi> I'M HERE FOR THE STREAM FOR ONCE.
[0:50:40] <$ac262> Are they setting Circe to be the main final Gillian of the show tho? That seems anti climatic
[0:50:43] <+Shindeil> @sphincter_spelunker LMFAO. I mean, cool. TY for that info.
[0:50:50] <BayowolfTerra> kinda sorta effective on the game to sabotage hooks
[0:50:52] <%mayorrev> yaaaaay teamwork!
[0:50:54] <%rumtumtugnutz> People are being nice online? Must be a troll.
[0:50:54] <%Breakfast_Megapowers> Look at this Teamwork being TOXIC
[0:51:02] <RadSuit> @NightOwlSam She's in Japan, most likely. So totally different timezone.
[0:51:05] <BayowolfTerra> the map the game, I mean
[0:51:07] <$AgentTexes> Paige is toxic confirmed
[0:51:12] <deeporange> uwu what's this *notices your awesomeness*
[0:51:17] <%Pandora_Prime> a big box of MURDER
[0:51:22] <ChefRishi> Oh is she in Japan right now... Is this even live... I'm confused
[0:51:27] <ChefRishi> That's a nuts background
[0:51:29] <+koboldconsortium> is it possible to sabotage all hooks on a map?
[0:51:32] <@commanderclaw> Paige is hitting on these ladies even when a killer is chasing them
[0:51:34] <DesuDesuDokiDoki> go help ur harem
[0:51:36] <$Sphincter_Spelunker> @Shindeil Depends on the diet, yeah. Might wanna be careful about loose skin/ stretch marks
[0:51:42] <Run44forrest> pat couldnt go to japan because he big litters
[0:51:45] <%cervidaequus> Live from the mysterious southern hemisphere
[0:51:45] <televisedrevolting> @chefrishi She in the void.

[0:52:07] <+Shindeil> @zulos98 Nice! Cool. Then I don’t feel like sharing, anymore. Chat gonna get concerned
[0:52:07] <nmaten> hes camping
[0:52:09] <+fatal_penguin_> Sounds like it. This season is ok so far but.._ugh
[0:52:10] <Run44forrest> no elmo vore please

[0:52:15] <%dtd63> I'd rather have loose skin than 60 pounds though
[0:52:28] <+tigerfang86> too blind for everthing
[0:52:32] <+Shindeil> @sphincter_spelunker Ha...haha.
[0:52:33] <%cervidaequus> You will permanently have lbs of loose skin tho
[0:52:36] <+Zulos_> @Shindeil fair enough
[0:52:37] <%Breakfast_Megapowers> its a WERESHARK
[0:52:40] <%cervidaequus> Unless surgery
[0:52:43] <mankeyfight> Blind? Do you need glasses?
[0:52:44] <BayowolfTerra> I didn't catch it, what rank is Paige currently?
[0:52:45] <%Mr_Kalamari> Mr_Kalamari subscribed with Twitch Prime. They've subscribed for 3 months! MY DESIRE IS GROWING
[0:52:55] <%Breakfast_Megapowers> who needs eyes?
[0:53:02] <televisedrevolting> @mr_kalamari AROUSED
[0:53:04] <Plutt_bug> toe-tem

[0:53:16] <$AgentTexes> 14
[0:53:17] <BayowolfTerra> betcha he's a noed boy
[0:53:19] <%rumtumtugnutz> You ranked up last match
[0:53:20] <ChefRishi> apparently the terms under which you get excess skin are vague
[0:53:26] <%NWR_James> alright chat, I need sleep. Be sure to give Paige lots of deliberately and comedic bad advice
[0:53:30] <Jodoxk1> Get your eyes fixed stripBaka
[0:53:33] <ChefRishi> i know a guy who was approaching 400 lbs and is rail thin now, no problems
[0:53:36] <Scarnehu> Japanese glasses: a single sheet of glass folded 1000 times
[0:53:50] <%Breakfast_Megapowers> Eyes never helped blind people
[0:53:59] <%cervidaequus> @shindeil you can firm muscles but loose skin from excess weight loss is harder to manage without surgery, depending on how big you are/were
[0:54:00] <%rumtumtugnutz> So then it's 14 I guess. I have NO IDEA how this game workd! :D
[0:54:00] <televisedrevolting> @nwr_james Good Night

[0:58:20] <PartyForSorrying> Scott Shelby 4 DbD
[0:58:20] <%Kirby_Sauce> never APOLOGIZE
[0:58:21] <gigamercer> Kicked for disparaging the killer.

[0:58:30] <+Binary_Fireball> think it's ok
[0:58:30] <%Breakfast_Megapowers> escaping the game = escaping the killer Kappa
[0:58:32] <+scholarlysorcerer> Stream is fine
[0:58:35] <SirSmudgey> @PeachSaliva it counts as an escape if the killer disconnects
[0:58:35] <+scholarlysorcerer> Refresh
[0:58:35] <%TheWinged7> hi curios im wonged
[0:58:36] <%Kirby_Sauce> I had my caps on backwards

[0:58:43] <%WheatlyXT> Host dc not you
[0:58:43] <@StridentSong> Killer disconnected. You didn't get kicked
[0:58:46] <BayowolfTerra> I think he just lost connection though
[0:58:49] <%Mr_Kalamari> @partyforsorrying Him screaming at you for doing your job would be great
[0:58:56] <+Bigmeanjean> @PeachSaliva i feel like twitch has been borking an me alot lately
[0:58:59] <Run44forrest> wow japan internet Sucks
[0:59:09] <$HarraceHarrison> Usually you get 0 points if you DC
[0:59:10] <BayowolfTerra> it look different if you did
[0:59:12] <@StridentSong> You didn't get disconnected, you're still rank 16. You would have depipped
[0:59:18] <%ryderbootz> sans has cursed the stream
[0:59:19] <%WheatlyXT> It showed him disconnected lol
[0:59:20] <ChefRishi> It's traffic from the boobie streamers
[0:59:20] <+Shindeil> Killer is dead
[0:59:24] <+Andrizzleton> that wacky bogan internet
[0:59:28] <%mayorrev> weird how they DC'd right when stream choked tho
[0:59:29] <%Breakfast_Megapowers> US internet is BARELY operable
[0:59:31] <SilentGaming49> oh wait you're in Japan right now?
[0:59:32] <%mayorrev> but w/e
[0:59:33] <%RafflesiaA> 3pm shouldn't be a problem time
[0:59:41] <%Kirby_Sauce> It's almost like all those australians I like complainging about the wifif has some basis
[0:59:45] <+Cipherlogic> @PeachSaliva it said "host disconnected" that means the killer DC'd
[0:59:48] <+MeowFyre> bless their boobies
[0:59:49] <Neo_Kaiser> That's Australian internet for you.
[0:59:50] <$Sphincter_Spelunker> Schrodinger's internet
[0:59:51] <graemecrackers1> bottlenecking ?
[0:59:55] <Run44forrest> pat should become a booby streamer
[0:59:55] <ValidVenasaur> killer disconnected thats why it said you escaped
[0:59:59] <@commanderclaw> "God bless us, every titty"
[1:00:03] <RileyOMalley> Bless every last boobie

[1:00:09] <Megaleg> @Run44forrest sint he already
[1:00:12] <xmetalicdemonx> Don't judge someone makin that cheddar.
[1:00:15] <Run44forrest> no
[1:00:17] <ChefRishi> This is the first stream I'm catching live, usually catch up on Youtube - Eagerly awaiting Karaoke stream @RuslandMakarov
[1:00:18] <Megaleg> isnt*
[1:00:20] <%ThePuddingDead> Eyyy, what up nerds!
[1:00:20] <@StridentSong> @mayorrev The punishment system in the game for ragequitting is it takes pips away from your rank. Paige is at 0 pips of Rank 16, so if she has disconnected she would be at 17 with two pips to go
[1:00:23] <%Breakfast_Megapowers> Wasn't the Killer winning?
[1:00:28] <%mayorrev> ahh i see
[1:00:36] <SpaceGuntank> a killer ragequitting should always count as a spiritual win
[1:00:44] <+MeowFyre> the killer committed sudoku to regain his honor
[1:00:45] <$Kataguro> And you have to play Ace Attorney
[1:00:49] <%ThePuddingDead> @PeachSaliva Hi Paige! How are things in Japan thus far?
[1:00:51] <@commanderclaw> Or you could be Judge Dredd
[1:00:51] <%ryderbootz> wait is dedede a judge?
[1:00:52] <Run44forrest> what thw fuck does that mean
[1:00:53] <Scarnehu> blessed be the titty streamers, for they shall inherit the cash
[1:00:56] <SilentGaming49> How's Plauge and his barf juice? haven't gotten around to playing in a little bit.
[1:01:02] <Plutt_bug> The real killer was the friends we made along the way
[1:01:03] <nmaten> also it could be an internet thing this games netcode isnt perfect
[1:01:03] <JamesTyphoon> being honest, if i had larger breasts i wound probably do it myself.
[1:01:09] <ChefRishi> i got iced tea gummies
[1:01:20] <$Kataguro> Oh, I meant in order to judge people, but that too.
[1:01:23] <%dtd63> Facecamp ---> get juked ---> ragequit true combo
[1:01:24] <$AgentTexes> If you've got to camp and slug as wraith you're not winning.
[1:01:26] <BayowolfTerra> oh that's a fridge. ok.
[1:01:29] <Run44forrest> oh i thought plague of gripes was making moonshine or omething
[1:01:30] <Pavel_Stuchlik> It's the killer, do not die.
[1:01:34] <@StridentSong> The game is also crashing a lot as of the most recent update. He may have crashed. I'm really hoping they fix it with the Endgame update
[1:01:38] <$Kataguro> Jesus
[1:01:42] <ChefRishi> go boobie steamers, but rules are rules, on that note
[1:01:44] <%ThePuddingDead> @PeachSaliva Hope that migraine wasn't too bad, I had a minor one a few days ago and kept me from sleeping for 2 days
