[1:25:49] <wheke_> ?????????//
[1:25:49] <Zebroneath> Maybe a vertical swinging greatsword is not the best weapon for Paige.

[1:41:12] <XzileGaming> who need the Pursuer when you have SKELETON SOLDIER
[1:41:14] <lethallylactic> @PeachSaliva I notice you've been having problems with whiffs, if you can one-hand that sword it gives you a wider horizontal swing that makes hitting enemies a bit easier.
[1:41:15] <Monkeyweed21> YOU KILLED YOUR FRIEND

[1:41:53] <+JonesMcFly> Paige is playing 5D chess tonight

[1:52:25] <Angry_Ev1L> star wars was never good
[1:52:25] <StaceMcGate> Paige is trying to distract us with Star Wars
[1:52:26] <soraabora> even the cast hates last jedi lmao
[1:52:26] <lethallylactic> LUL
[1:52:27] <@PlagueOfGripes> you sure showed that imaginary person
[1:52:28] <yourliteraldog> Yes
[1:52:28] <%onlypuppet> I don‚Äôt know enough to have an opinion
[1:52:31] <Plague_bagel> lmao
[1:52:32] <Neo_Kaiser> Paige! Pat thinks the Lightspeed scene in TLJ makes sense.
[1:52:32] <Djinnazz> MEH
[1:52:33] <%Kataguro> They could be cosplaying better things
[1:52:34] <romanticzomedy> so why shit on them?
[1:52:36] <%Shadowpint> It seems I care about a bunch of Star Wars stuff EXCEPT the movies
[1:52:36] <%SvenHolgersson> Cosplay? good Rey? Bad
[1:52:37] <%QueequegTheater> @PeachSaliva I;m a real Star Wars fan and I liked it
[1:52:38] <%typhan> typhan subscribed with Twitch Prime. They've subscribed for 2 months! you uys are so Cool
[1:52:38] <Melchior_the_Wise> Movie is terrible, cast is terrible
[1:52:39] <+Pookiedaexzile> Rey would be cool if she was Pockets
[1:52:39] <+necrocannibal2> Star Wars has been garbage since Episode 6
[1:52:40] <wheke_> rei cosplayers are hawt
[1:52:42] <%zamatermort> It was fine
[1:52:43] <+Bonzosan> Hey Eva is good
[1:52:43] <gnarly_memes_bro> YOU DON'T NEED TO GO IN HERE
[1:52:43] <%Typhaeon> Rey cosplayer? You mean any given cardbord cutout
[1:52:43] <%Promessa_EX> I clapped when I saw the sith troopers
[1:52:43] <$Piemono> Remember guys, liking something bad makes you dumb
[1:52:44] <romanticzomedy> tlj was fine lol
[1:52:44] <+doc_ock_rokc> first one was bad
[1:52:44] <Angry_Ev1L> 1st one also sucked
[1:52:45] <ThatOneGuyYouSaw> @PlagueOfGripes I love you, please marry me.
[1:52:46] <$SinisterBroccoli> There was cool shit in the Last jedi tho
[1:52:46] <DFireCreations> star wars is the new politics
[1:52:46] <wheke_> cosplayers*
[1:52:46] <Conky89> I don't think I have ever seen a fanbase that hates their beloved franchise as much as Star Wars.
[1:52:48] <BeefyQueefer> i want to cummie on reys eyebrows
[1:52:48] <+patriotrenegade> first one was derivative but safe
[1:52:48] <%Shadowpint> Like KotOR and stuff
[1:52:49] <%Ion_Laser> Force Awakens is bland
[1:52:49] <OldManDeckardCain> BUT IF YOU DON'T LIKE IT YUOR SEXIST AND RACIST
[1:52:49] <$Agami23> paige, your favorite star wars movie is strange magic.
[1:52:49] <%freezydude> the first one was just "REMEMBER STAR WARS?
[1:52:51] <%SvenHolgersson> First one was so forgettable and boring
[1:52:51] <bleugh> last jedi > farce awakens
[1:52:52] <%bbHighvalor> Rey is garbage
[1:52:52] <romanticzomedy> y'all fuckin crazy
[1:52:52] <%QueequegTheater> TLJ wasn't a trash fire at all
[1:52:52] <+turretgunz> stop being toxic paige
[1:52:53] <+RETROxRELOADED> Disney sucks
[1:52:53] <+SpamKingRathalos> They're both fucking horrible
[1:52:55] <Valdorick> Rei cosplayers can't be cool, because they're woman, and paige hates them.
[1:52:55] <Melchior_the_Wise> 1st one was just IV but worse
[1:52:56] <%SWFanatic> speed
[1:52:56] <SubliminaIMessages> TLJ is pretty bad yeah
[1:52:57] <StaceMcGate> please heal
[1:52:57] <TwinBat> first one was by the numbers generic
[1:52:57] <%Ion_Laser> TLJ is good
[1:52:59] <+necrocannibal2> the moment Ewoks were invented to sell more toys, Star Wars was done
[1:53:00] <%freezydude> The first one was LITERALLY 4
[1:53:00] <thealientrilogy> Star Wars- is garbage and it's great. TLJ is just a shit KOTOR 2 TSL.
[1:53:01] <Meekest> I loved TLJ and TFA tbh
[1:53:04] <%zamatermort> TFA is GREAT LJ is fine
[1:53:04] <immortan_joel> It‚Äôs good, fuck y‚Äôall
[1:53:06] <%FrogROOT> i am so tired of hearing about star wars from everyone
[1:53:07] <+Admiral_PopnFresh> No, Force Awakens was a trash fire, I hate it much more than Last Jedi
[1:53:07] <DesuDesuDokiDoki> first was average, second was not good, third will be trashfire
[1:53:09] <+doc_ock_rokc> @SvenHolgersson the onlything memorible was TR8R
[1:53:10] <romanticzomedy> the sequel trilogy might just not be for you?
[1:53:10] <%CJett92> I literally just rewatched TLJ today, it's still pretty fucking garbage
[1:53:11] <%ElkRiverDog> Hate the story not the characters
[1:53:11] <%MyNameIsRasus> TLJ was fine, you guys are just mean
[1:53:12] <$Piemono> TFA is bad for a different reason than TLJ
[1:53:13] <Dementedpenguin> The Last Jedi felt like a filler episode. A bad one.
[1:53:14] <Dastardry> All Disney has managed to do is make me realize I might not like Star Wars very much at all
[1:53:14] <+Jekado> original animated clone wars is good
[1:53:14] <DatAsuna> @PeachSaliva Paige is never going to remember not to change direction on the great sword
[1:53:15] <+XeroSigmaPrime> @Neo_Kaiser Technically, none of the lightspeed scenes in any scifi movie makes sense
[1:53:16] <+megaotter> TLJ was fine, people were always going to hate new star wars movies, and probably they should have never tried making modern star wars movies. That's my hot ake
[1:53:16] <peachy996> I've seen none of the new one but I did see Solo, that sucked
[1:53:17] <+Pookiedaexzile> All of Star Wars is Garbage, just had good actors in the right places
[1:53:17] <%Kataguro> Fuck doors
[1:53:18] <+megaotter> take*
[1:53:19] <%Typhaeon> Fuck Lucasarts for rushing Obsidian on KotoR 2
[1:53:21] <+Jekado> not the cg clone wars aparently
[1:53:22] <hectic_harlequin> Doors are for wimps
[1:53:24] <PrimordialDonut> I feel like 90% of the starwars hatred is bandwagon, its uncanny how much people hate shit for no reason
[1:53:24] <Silly_Duckling> isn't that how you open doors?
[1:53:24] <%skizzuto> Paige and doors are natural enemies
[1:53:25] <%Zaphire_Saucypants> I liked TLJ. And TFA. They're just not my favorite Star Wars movies. Originals will always have that place in my heart.
[1:53:26] <%juxtest> The slow speed space chase would be a good setting for a different movie.
[1:53:27] <peachy996> Suck Folo
[1:53:29] <$lotharrio> Remember when the guy was going to sacrifice himself to save the day, then a girl he doesn't know crashes her space car into his and dies, then says that she loves him and then dies while all their friends get murdered?
[1:53:31] <Mister_McDerp> always a bad sign
[1:53:31] <Dragon_Batman> Sometimes deleted scenes just make it better sometimes
[1:53:34] <%Zaphire_Saucypants> *Their
[1:53:35] <+umber_helgramite> I enjoyed solo
[1:53:35] <dekkitout> Based Snyder cut ResidentSleeper
[1:53:36] <thealientrilogy> Star Wars- is garbage and it's great. TLJ is just a shit KOTOR 2 TSL.
[1:53:36] <@PlagueOfGripes> "You should see the shitty scenes that deleted from the movie you hate"
[1:53:37] <Neo_Kaiser> What about Lord of the Rings Pat?
[1:53:40] <OldManDeckardCain> The deleted scenes are terrible tho LUL
[1:53:40] <%Promessa_EX> Complete cinematic failure
[1:53:40] <$Tredecian> TLJ wouldn't have been so bad if it had pick a direction and stayed course
[1:53:40] <%zamatermort> ALL movies have that Pat
[1:53:42] <NaturalGear> that's pretty common Pat
[1:53:42] <%SvenHolgersson> @doc_ock_rokc Finn should've been the main character so we could learn who the fuck that guy even was lol
[1:53:42] <%Zaphire_Saucypants> Wait
[1:53:44] <%FrogROOT> what an idiot he is
[1:53:46] <%FrogROOT> and you are
[1:53:47] <JonEWorldbeater> I've seen people say Last Jedi was a masterpiece
[1:53:47] <+mjkenney24> TLJ is good, the only bits i'm not s fan of are the forced jokes at the end of like 50% of the dialogue
[1:53:47] <%Zaphire_Saucypants> I was right the first time
[1:53:48] <RushUnplugged> "you're bad for liking thing" says woman who's first instinct towards a door is to SMASH IT
[1:53:49] <%Kataguro> Just leave him
[1:53:51] <DesuDesuDokiDoki> aim
[1:53:52] <+TopTieramisu> FIGHTING GAMES
[1:53:52] <Dragon_Batman> Like Bat V Supes was much better with the added stuff even though it was still bad
[1:53:54] <%Lion_kun> TLJ could have been great but was bogged down by some awful execution
[1:53:56] <SubliminaIMessages> Some of The deleted scenes are great
[1:53:57] <%FrogROOT> yeeeah
[1:53:58] <DracaenaLeaf> byebye
[1:54:00] <%QueequegTheater> @PeachSaliva TLJ was good tho
[1:54:03] <TheZearGuy> Wait for it
[1:54:04] <%Schlomogoldbergsteinowitz> He's just hanging out, leave him aloone
[1:54:05] <%Lion_kun> The casino and Poe stuff were awful
[1:54:06] <rytisone> just cut Joker scenes out of suicide squad movie Kappa
[1:54:07] <wheke_> DOG CON
[1:54:07] <+Dr_Mooose> yeah
[1:54:08] <+Jekado> running sets
[1:54:08] <thealientrilogy> Star Wars- is garbage and it's great. TLJ is just a shit KOTOR 2 TSL.

[1:54:12] <Neo_Kaiser> But Paige, TLJ subverted your expectations.
[1:54:12] <wheke_> THATS A DOG CON
[1:54:12] <Conky89> But if you never delete scenes, then you get stuff like a King Kong movie almost 3 hours long.
[1:54:12] <Melchior_the_Wise> Still not as bad as the Christmas Special
[1:54:12] <Mr_Strut> Low FPS dogs
[1:54:14] <alwayspronking> 2fps doggos PogChamp
[1:54:15] <@PlagueOfGripes> they're patrolling

[1:54:18] <romanticzomedy> poe servers no purpose
[1:54:19] <hectic_harlequin> @PeachSaliva Are you interested in playing Demon's Souls eventually?
[1:54:20] <romanticzomedy> serves*
[1:54:21] <StaceMcGate> I just want to go one without Star Wars in my life
[1:54:21] <yourliteraldog> It was inoffensive but not good. People say its worse than prequels.
[1:54:21] <+megaotter> DOG CON DOG CON DOG CON DOG CON
[1:54:25] <%MyNameIsRasus> BLIGHT CON 2 BABYYY

[1:54:31] <%arcaderabbit48> Doesnt that guy she just killed aggro when you get to the ship or something?
[1:54:32] <+Pookiedaexzile> Star Wars Was always trash cept for the story of the Pockets the Sith Shakedown Artist
[1:54:36] <%Kataguro> What the fuck is that thing
[1:54:36] <thealientrilogy> ENDLESS TRASH
[1:54:37] <+XeroSigmaPrime> Its like people who think Justice LEague wont be shit if the "Snyder Cut" comes out
[1:54:37] <+necrocannibal2> the movie didn't lose much

[2:30:37] <filialpails> EMERALD HERALD IS A CUTE
[2:30:37] <shadytreeofknowledge> beat them like u were wearing a White beater @ballerswagbro9k
[2:30:38] <%QueequegTheater> @PeachSaliva There is a system for honor duels. Invasion IS NOT IT
[2:30:38] <%umbypokochan> lol she was sitting like a lallafell
[2:30:38] <Habblewater> Wait what did i miss?
[2:30:39] <$lotharrio> In Bloodborne, I throw rocks at people who bow.
[2:30:41] <+metalsiren31> For invaders there's no real rules
[2:30:42] <%SvenHolgersson> TONGUE BUT HOLE
[2:30:43] <Roz_Lynd> pat is not very sportsmanlike
[2:30:44] <%juxtest> The cape is even red. Like Papyrus'
[2:30:48] <+metalsiren31> Rules are for duels
[2:30:48] <Quietshun13> but it's proper
[2:30:48] <Habblewater> did she murder someone when they bowed?
[2:30:50] <%depressed_skeleton> Do i matter?
[2:30:50] <Dragon_Batman> It matters in your hear
[2:30:52] <+Dr_Mooose> play to win
[2:30:52] <Zombrocom> Well, it IS rarer than the other animations
[2:30:52] <%Sphincter_Spelunker> Pat has no honor
[2:30:52] <Fujiwara_92> It is rare
[2:30:53] <Valdorick> Invade my game, invade my rules.
[2:30:54] <Dragon_Batman> heart*
[2:30:54] <Berendenn> Bowing is for duels not invasions
[2:30:57] <+greenhathero> All rules are fake
[2:30:58] <NemokillerV> Especially when its your first playthrough
[2:30:59] <%Sphincter_Spelunker> But what has honor done for me
[2:31:01] <Valdorick> And my rules are get the fuck outta my game.
[2:31:03] <waterstealer> BURN BONE ASH
[2:31:03] <+BioStormX> Honor is only for arranged duels, if you get invaded you use every dirty trick you can
[2:31:04] <LixFury> Its about being Sporting
[2:31:06] <%QueequegTheater> @PeachSaliva there is a designated area in the game for honor duels
[2:31:07] <Ted_the_red> and lets be honest you need all the advantage you can get anyways
[2:31:07] <Silly_Duckling> The rules apply until they don't, honestly
[2:31:09] <%onlypuppet> The herald
[2:31:09] <LixFury> Ya shits
[2:31:09] <%depressed_skeleton> My CULTURE!!
[2:31:11] <+RevolverOcelot16> Look at the baby. Aww
[2:31:11] <+HotGarbageBoyo> Mulleton
[2:31:11] <dekkitout> That explains why Pat doesn't adhere to social etiquette...
[2:31:12] <+SpoonlessAlakazam> They don't matter if you're a worthless peasant jermaDisgust
[2:31:13] <%MyNameIsRasus> @greenhathero this guy gets it
[2:31:15] <malesin_01> ds2 is a ruleless hellscape
[2:31:15] <+Blucarot> rules in combat? what nonsense is that? it's either me or them dead
[2:31:16] <+Tolvan> pat was known to lack honor, this is unsurprising
[2:31:17] <%MaddyCaddy> It's like samurais being made about European guns
[2:31:18] <shadytreeofknowledge> in the game too look so Dorky
[2:31:25] <King_thunder365> Be careful not to be hit by any barrels, Wharf!
[2:31:26] <%MaddyCaddy> mad*
[2:31:26] <dj_arashi_rora> "Pat: Fuck honor."
[2:31:27] <Roz_Lynd> fun fact @PeachSaliva @angriestpat i was the type of bitchsicle who would hide and waste invaders' time
[2:31:28] <%depressed_skeleton> @PeachSaliva Excuse me, we call that a Skullet by the way.
[2:31:28] <Conky89> There was never supposed to be etiquette in invasions. You are meant to be a dick to the invaded player.
[2:31:30] <NaturalGear> honestly DS etiquette is the most fascinating thing about the multiplayer
[2:31:32] <Wesciet> I like doing the fake rules, but I recognize that when I do I gotta be on my toes for people who don‚Äôt care. It‚Äôs my fault if I can‚Äôt back roll out of my bow in time
[2:31:33] <+gespenst25> skeleton warriors

[2:33:17] <%MyNameIsRasus> Does she even remember Lucatiel?
[2:33:18] <Finakala> Lucatiel should be fine against Flexile
[2:33:19] <TyrantSlime> Her pathing here was so shitty
[2:33:19] <buerdo> Totally not gonna find luca
[2:33:24] <%QueequegTheater> @PeachSaliva Pat did you know she got a big buff in Scholar
[2:33:38] <yourliteraldog> crush your enemies. See them driven before you. And to hear the lamentations of their women.

[2:33:47] <+flavonoskovitch> not a sword, more like a great slab of iron
[2:33:47] <katocrimson> Is there a Lucatel Easter egg in DS3?
[2:33:49] <+patriotrenegade> yeah she TANKS
[2:33:54] <@Calek> NPC helpers in NG+ are nuts, they start off kinda lame and just used as distraction, then they become boss killers
[2:33:54] <%Sphincter_Spelunker> no
[2:33:55] <$StaceMcGate> Chat, what's the death counter at?
[2:33:55] <Habblewater> Good because she was fucking useless in standard ds2

[2:34:26] <DatAsuna> YOu already have the debuff from lucatiel
[2:34:35] <+Doomtastic> protecc luca at all costs
[2:34:36] <+ChaosVulpes> Funny how this upcoming boss has a mechanic that never matters cause he dies so fast... the fact that his area starts to fill with water as you fight him...
[2:34:37] <+patriotrenegade> LOOK AT HER TANK THAT SHIT
[2:34:43] <%QueequegTheater> @PeachSaliva There is an NPC called Bradley that can solo the entire final boss rush in one go on NG+
[2:34:47] <%CappuccinoGuil> Alright gang, I'm going to dip, I need sleep BAD! See you all around.
[2:34:48] <+megaotter> isnt debuff the same for 2 summons as 1?
[2:34:51] <+necrocannibal2> @ChaosVulpes wait, what
[2:34:52] <MidnightBurst12> bring a friendo then meet your endo

[2:35:25] <%cureneckbeard> Solaire gave us a soapstone. So this guy us like the new Solaire
[2:35:27] <%Sphincter_Spelunker> She has to survive the boss
[2:35:28] <%QueequegTheater> 3
[2:35:28] <+ChaosVulpes> @necrocannibal2 Yeah, the ship slowly starts to fill with water as you fight him... but he just dies so quick it never matters.
[2:35:28] <%SWFanatic> Is this Anor Londo?
[2:35:30] <fruit_pie_the_magician> Summon even more so you can make sure Lucatiel survives
[2:35:30] <%superc37> ngl I always found it kinda weird how certain friendly NPCs like lucatiel have their own unique koveset despite you never fighting her
[2:35:31] <zamzoph> I don't think Pate requires any bosses?
[2:35:31] <%onlypuppet> Ghosh nice
[2:35:34] <FirearmsInstructor> @PeachSaliva How's the sun doing?
[2:35:34] <+BioStormX> I don't think Pate requires you to summon him for his quest
[2:35:35] <@PlagueOfGripes> and she must live
[2:35:37] <Dragon_Batman> Luca is kool
[2:35:41] <%MyNameIsRasus> She has to survive
[2:35:45] <TsunTsuchinoko> must protec
[2:35:46] <Sunstalker> Bradley was an NPC too

[2:36:33] <StarlitStunner> stripFear
[2:36:33] <Finakala> Easiest boss? This ain't Covetous Demon
[2:36:38] <+necrocannibal2> @PeachSaliva easiest boss in the game btw
[2:36:46] <$SleepyMaribo> literally walked in and said fuck it, ima face fuck these hits...
[2:36:48] <%cureneckbeard> crazy talk

[2:36:50] <vonmaultke> Stand by to stand by, this maybe a maybe
[2:36:51] <RiverBirch> YOURE NOT HUMAN.
[2:36:52] <Silly_Duckling> But hey, you should see the other guy...'s mace
[2:36:53] <Berendenn> if you can solo the ruin sentinels you can do this one paige
[2:36:54] <%Sphincter_Spelunker> prevents babies?
[2:36:56] <%worldbrand> effigy?
[2:36:57] <%zamatermort> easy mode
[2:36:59] <%onlypuppet> Conservation of resources?
[2:37:00] <+CutCombo> monkaS
[2:37:02] <+oOZtkOo> the problem was the complete lack of skill Kappa
[2:37:03] <%QueequegTheater> Use thing
[2:37:04] <SulfurousAcid> Baby Prevention system, a condom?

[2:37:06] <%MaddyCaddy> Birth control?
[2:37:06] <%QueequegTheater> Human
[2:37:09] <reasonance> the fact that that bridge shortcut didn't exist in vanilla blows my fuckin mind
[2:37:11] <%Lion_kun> Easiest is that congregation\
[2:37:22] <%QueequegTheater> Safe, towards the boat of enemies
[2:37:23] <+BubbaRands> Pull out method?
[2:37:24] <%g0atmeal> Can't wait till she sees the area after the wharf lol
[2:37:28] <Habblewater> I'd say that fat bastard in tower is the easiest
[2:37:31] <Simonator7x> the mask did not scare him, stratagem fail
[2:37:31] <DesuDesuDokiDoki> ?
[2:37:32] <%QueequegTheater> GO BACK
[2:37:34] <+ChaosVulpes> Easiest IS the congregation... but this guy is low tier boss too
[2:37:35] <SulfurousAcid> Go back?
[2:37:36] <Finakala> Congregation isnt a real boss
[2:37:40] <reasonance> how did they design such an obvious spot for a shortcut and then just NOT put it in at first
[2:37:41] <+apocplz> 35 effigies holy shit
[2:37:49] <Wesciet> Congregation, Covetous, and Flexile co-founded a support group for underwhelming bosses

[2:51:11] <+Pookiedaexzile> Frame Data is in Mid Tier sword can be B Tier if 1 handed
[2:51:12] <Conky89> you can but it make you thicc
[2:51:18] <Berendenn> No shields
[2:51:19] <shadytreeofknowledge> thats smarter so she wont Pat
[2:51:20] <Mister_McDerp> SHIELDS ARE FOR PUSSIES
[2:51:22] <+dawsfloss> Am I the only one who prefers to play Sorcs in Souls?
[2:51:24] <shadow1man9> I would actually use the shield
[2:51:25] <Mister_McDerp> NO SHIELD
[2:51:28] <%cureneckbeard> drop your whield wooly
[2:51:28] <%BallerSwagBro9k> YEYEYEYEYEYE
[2:51:30] <Blank9> put a skirt on instead of pants
[2:51:32] <Blank9> and shield
[2:51:33] <%dabeaminator> Fashion Souls all the way
[2:51:35] <%MyNameIsRasus> Not that much worse
[2:51:35] <+BioStormX> Way worse, but the shield will block a lot of damage for you
[2:51:36] <%QueequegTheater> Actually it's not that much worse
[2:51:37] <%evilmagetim> its still really good
[2:51:37] <@Calek> @PeachSaliva 100% no damage from a physical block is better than damage reduction from a piece of armour
[2:51:39] <Berendenn> Shield is for small and weak
[2:51:41] <%freezydude> its not that worse
[2:51:41] <Berendenn> you are big and strong
[2:51:42] <$Agami23> paige, just pump your stats and get BIG DOUBLE SWORD
[2:51:45] <+Pookiedaexzile> Sheild will introduce new problems
[2:51:47] <Quietshun13> bone stuff is plus 5 tho
[2:51:50] <Dragon_Batman> The thing is you like 2 facefuck enemies and hit them with big strength
[2:51:53] <LoneFonte> Not THAT worse tho
[2:51:56] <+emperri> less the third as worse
[2:51:57] <%onlypuppet> Shields in ds2
[2:51:57] <DesuDesuDokiDoki> drop
[2:51:58] <%QueequegTheater> @PeachSaliva You're losing like 10% total defense
[2:52:00] <%Sphincter_Spelunker> @dawsfloss Do you have fun with it? I always used them as stand ins for a lack of archer builds
[2:52:01] <+RealThiele> drop that shield
[2:52:01] <Valdorick> Like the dropping of a shield
[2:52:01] <%evilmagetim> Bone set better
[2:52:01] <%dabeaminator> @Calek is totally correct
[2:52:03] <Mister_McDerp> DROP YOUR SHIELD
[2:52:03] <NaturalGear> like what?

[2:52:14] <SulfurousAcid> but a coward wall
[2:52:14] <$avarice99> I wonder if she would like that craftsman's hammer
[2:52:14] <Blank9> use a crossbow in the other hand
[2:52:14] <%freezydude> USE THE SHIELD

[2:52:19] <+BioStormX> Light armor +shield is fun
[2:52:20] <Conky89> Armor is not that good

[2:54:08] <Melchior_the_Wise> Dual Greatswords?
[2:54:15] <Cryomancer_Maurice> This is the worst idea; DS2 is just asking her to be invaded with all the souls she's consuming for her soul memory.
[2:54:19] <Finakala> ADP is a lie
[2:54:19] <+apocplz> it'll be MONTHS before she gets to teh Fume Knight apocpl1LUL
[2:54:19] <+BioStormX> Get your agility up past 100 at least
[2:54:22] <%Promessa_EX> Just clear them
[2:54:23] <Zombrocom> Flexile gives you the barbed club, which sucks anyway so fuck it
[2:54:26] <Habblewater> Powerstance Smelter Greatswords
[2:54:27] <%QueequegTheater> Won't hit a breakpoint tho @PeachSaliva
[2:54:28] <+Pookiedaexzile> Two Sword Loard
[2:54:36] <%Sphincter_Spelunker> Dual wield twinblades, like that one guy in Clone Wars
[2:54:37] <%onlypuppet> Ohh
[2:54:39] <%g0atmeal> 99 agility
[2:54:41] <%DesertPenguin> the break point for agility is 99 an 105
[2:54:44] <Zombrocom> Well, you want 99
[2:54:45] <%skm742> 99 best
[2:54:47] <Berendenn> strength or vigor
[2:54:49] <+XeroSigmaPrime> 99 AGI BEST
[2:54:51] <%MyNameIsRasus> 99
[2:54:53] <fruit_pie_the_magician> Jesus christ how are you level 74 already? i was like level sixty something when I beat this game
[2:54:54] <%skm742> 100 only gives 1 more iframe on BACKSTEPS
[2:54:55] <+artoriasisguts> where in the game are we bois?
[2:54:57] <%DesertPenguin> 99 is best
[2:54:59] <JonEWorldbeater> Alright stream, I'm out
[2:55:00] <%g0atmeal> 105 not worth it imo
[2:55:02] <%dabeaminator> Getting AGI to 100 is a good investment early in the game when levels are free.
[2:55:05] <%DesertPenguin> 24 ADP
[2:55:12] <+Pookiedaexzile> Numbers
[2:55:17] <%g0atmeal> attunement also increases it a little
[2:55:19] <Finakala> ADP in general is not worth it imo
[2:55:21] <%artoriasisguts> artoriasisguts subscribed with Twitch Prime. 
[2:55:24] <%QueequegTheater> @PeachSaliva 2 more levels will get you there
[2:55:29] <Zombrocom> I mean, 105 is better, but 99 is a good stopping point
[2:55:37] <%SWFanatic> ArtoriasISGuts!
[2:55:38] <Monkeyweed21> buy lifegem
[2:55:39] <%DesertPenguin> 99 is the same amount of i-frames as the DS1 mid-roll which she is used to
[2:55:46] <shadytreeofknowledge> try a shield for God's Sake
[2:55:53] <%QueequegTheater> @PeachSaliva I ran out of red eyes trying to get you, should I drop a red sign? Kappa
[2:56:05] <%DesertPenguin> shady did you watch her DS1 LP?
[2:56:07] <$StaceMcGate> How close is Paige to beating this game?
[2:56:07] <+Pookiedaexzile> PErfect timing
[2:56:08] <%SWFanatic> If I love Artorias, does that mean I love guts?
[2:56:13] <%QueequegTheater> @SWFanatic yes
[2:56:17] <%dabeaminator> WAIT @PeachSaliva dump your extra souls from leveling into the hag to max out your lifegems. It's always worth it, since you'll probably lose those souls anyway.
[2:56:17] <Corvellia> Down like the sun
[2:56:22] <KaiYuuta> It's a dex weapon i thinkl...

[2:57:25] <%Lion_kun> no more need to worry about direction

[3:14:19] <@PlagueOfGripes> Pursuer is actually not a single enemy. It's a minor mistranslation, and is a class of enemy type
[3:14:19] <%Sphincter_Spelunker> Pretend Pursuer is that bitch who punched you in the back

[3:14:44] <$lotharrio> Paige couldn't believe that Pursuer is a woman.
[3:14:44] <Neo_Kaiser> Is the reason why Paige keeps dying is because her character is a woman and she subconsciously keeps trying to get herself killed?

[3:57:10] <%dabeaminator> @PeachSaliva This game is three times longer than Dark Souls 1, just as a reminder
[3:57:10] <%2hutown> oh god, bloodborne was 2 nearly 3 years ago???
[3:57:12] <+Pookiedaexzile> DS2 is lame
[3:57:15] <+apocplz> DS2 with DLC is VERY long
[3:57:15] <%DesertPenguin> Your first DS2 VOD is from FEBRUARY!!!
[3:57:16] <%Kataguro> Paige, you should play something less taxing next time. Maybe a visual novel
[3:57:16] <Monkeyweed21> DONT START SO LATE
[3:57:21] <+Pookiedaexzile> but educational
[3:57:21] <%QueequegTheater> What are the lore implications of this arrow stuck in my face
[3:57:21] <%DesertPenguin> You started this in February
[3:57:22] <Coystick> @PlagueOfGripes Whens DS run 3?
[3:57:32] <$jorgamund> hey, I enjoyed the brick talk
[3:57:33] <fruit_pie_the_magician> All boss no hits takes like 12 hours

[3:58:15] <Bluewolf544> Cant wait for dual tigers
[3:58:15] <DrFacilier> Darks souls 2 would be long if it was actually challenging
[3:58:16] <+linSP> beat the worst part of the game, which is the whole game and then do the DLC
[3:58:16] <zamzoph> Except for the designated co-op areas
[3:58:18] <+Pookiedaexzile> t
[3:58:18] <%QueequegTheater> @PeachSaliva It used to be way worse

[4:04:35] <%dabeaminator> STARBOARD WOOLIE
[4:04:36] <%QueequegTheater> @PeachSaliva That's why your build sucks, because Pat is much worse at building characters in this game than he thinks he is
[4:04:36] <%SvenHolgersson> IT IS
[4:04:36] <Fien111> Yes, we watched it for YEARS
[4:04:36] <Ner234> WOW
[4:04:36] <%Breakfast_Megapowers> 30 Million yen is enough to buy a Square Watermelon, maybe even 10- Pat (Yakuza 4 LP)
[4:04:37] <Roz_Lynd> i puppeted a girl once. she made funny noises
[4:04:37] <%viciousgrim> keep your hand out of that pat?
[4:04:37] <moosemonkey397> totally is
[4:04:37] <%CommanderSqueaks> yes
[4:04:38] <JDebss> yeah
[4:04:38] <%g0atmeal> It's true
[4:04:39] <%SoFarFetched> Is he Ryoga from Ranma 1/2?
[4:04:39] <%D3rrtyD4n> believe it
[4:04:39] <Daxalog> Habeeb it
[4:04:40] <Corvellia> After tonight I don't know if I can believe it
[4:04:40] <MostFrank> it was
[4:04:40] <Etherealizer> doesn't that mean pat's hand is up your butt though
[4:04:41] <StarlitStunner> Fighting games
[4:04:42] <%DesertPenguin> yup
[4:04:42] <goose_attack_almanac> ITS SO BAD
[4:04:42] <Maids4lyfe> Woolie doesn't know Left and Right @PeachSaliva
[4:04:43] <shadow1man9> IT'S PRETTY BAD
[4:04:47] <+Pookiedaexzile> 87eps
[4:04:48] <+necrocannibal2> @PeachSaliva WOOLIE GOT LOST IN A STRAIGHT CORRIDOR
[4:04:49] <Dragon_Batman> That cave you went in before the stone thing he walked in and out of like twice
[4:04:50] <%Zaphire_Saucypants> @SoFarFetched Oh man, what a reference.
[4:04:52] <%SvenHolgersson> You at least pick weapons that do damage
[4:04:52] <+Darren716> Woolie has worse direction but better combat skills
[4:04:54] <%Breakfast_Megapowers> My Preasure
[4:04:58] <%D3rrtyD4n> getting lost is his ninja way
[4:04:59] <$StaceMcGate> "Woolie make a left"
[4:05:01] <Roz_Lynd> conglaturation
[4:05:01] <Coystick> Given your relative sizes it's more like you're the mech and Pat's the pilot
[4:05:04] <%Kinoskae> I bet Paige would remember to drop her shield tho
[4:05:06] <Fien111> Pat, you sabotage yourself by letting them both use Greatsword
[4:05:07] <%SoFarFetched> @Zaphire_Saucypants glad someone else got it LUL
[4:05:10] <+Pookiedaexzile> Woolie has footsies
[4:05:15] <%Habblewater> THROB sipsipGasm sipsipGasm
[4:05:15] <FirearmsInstructor> I fell asleep. What happened?
[4:05:18] <KaiserMario> "Woolie, left Woolie, LEFT WOOLIE! LEEEFFFTTT!!!" - Pat
[4:05:24] <fruit_pie_the_magician> Woolie is literally incapable of following directions
[4:05:26] <%Kataguro> Starboard, Woolie
[4:05:27] <%Kinoskae> Mostly b/c she'd forget she was using a shield
[4:05:27] <%QueequegTheater> cheer500 Last Jedi is good when you don't parrot RLM opinions like a priest reciting the Bible Kappa
[4:05:29] <%QueequegTheater> QueequegTheater's Cheer shared rewards to 10 others in Chat! 
[4:05:30] <DrFacilier> Its true, Woolie does not know what left is
[4:05:43] <+Pookiedaexzile> Woolie also looks for footsies where they're are none
[4:05:43] <Fien111> No one cares @QueequegTheater
[4:05:45] <Oxybe> "Woolie makes a left" *always sunny plays*
[4:05:45] <%DesertPenguin> Who is RLM?
[4:05:53] <%evilmagetim> Woolie can't tell forward from starboard
[4:05:53] <ittla> people with adhd like pickles because they give lots of STIMULATION
[4:05:54] <Mister_McDerp> what is RLM?
[4:05:55] <%Sphincter_Spelunker> I watch RLM to not make my own opinions
[4:05:57] <$StaceMcGate> @QueequegTheater I was laughing at Leia flying through space in the theaters LUL
[4:05:59] <%QueequegTheater> Alright I'm done now
[4:06:00] <Baeltyr> confusion
[4:06:02] <%Jack_of_No_Trades> this stream sparks joy
[4:06:04] <Dakuu75> red letter media? I guess
[4:06:06] <%onlypuppet> Pickle juice is good for getting rid of hiccups, I‚Äôve heard
[4:06:07] <%SWFanatic> but its a nice beanie
[4:06:08] <%2hutown> Red Letter Media?
[4:06:10] <%CommanderSqueaks> CONFUSION
[4:06:13] <%SvenHolgersson> Horniness
[4:06:15] <%QueequegTheater> BIG CONFUSE
[4:06:15] <%evilmagetim> I just feel anxiety
[4:06:18] <%DesertPenguin> Radio Le Mans in my neck of the woods lol
[4:06:18] <%Kataguro> Finn's character arc is nonexistent and bad thanks to TLJ
[4:06:24] <Neo_Kaiser> Ajoyance
[4:06:28] <Dementedpenguin> Jesus christ, you really want paige to see that message.....
[4:06:29] <Dakuu75> btw, ANYTHING is good when you ignore EVERYTHING bad about it. I dunno what that comment was trying to say
[4:06:35] <%Zaphire_Saucypants> oh yeah, I've been hearing how the actors ship Finn and Poe
[4:06:35] <FirearmsInstructor> @PeachSaliva I am less sad because you exist, Paige. sporkyHug Also Pat... maybe...
[4:06:41] <%Nox_ludicro> AW SHIT I GOT A SUB?
[4:06:42] <%QueequegTheater> DW about it
[4:06:42] <%NickNackProductions> ayyyy
[4:06:46] <%dabeaminator> @QueequegTheater just enjoy the movie if you like it. Many people, like myself, didn't care for it, but that doesn't mean you can't.
[4:06:48] <+thefakeh> @DesertPenguin i guess that makes 2 of us
[4:06:48] <mechengineers> favorite demtri martin joke: its weird "finger puppet" sounds okay as a noun but not as adjective,
[4:06:52] <+Pookiedaexzile> Star Wars wasbad before Plinkett read Shadowrun
[4:06:53] <+Jekado> @FirearmsInstructor what about elmo
[4:06:55] <%JJCheeker> finn should have been the main protagonist
[4:06:57] <Oxybe> If you have to go "x is good if you don't parrot y" is never a good indication a movie can stand on it's own merit
[4:06:58] <%Nox_ludicro> Thanks jet!
[4:07:02] <FirearmsInstructor> @Jekado Who?
[4:07:05] <%SvenHolgersson> There are no characters in Star Wars anymore just ripoff cardboard cutouts
[4:07:05] <%DesertPenguin> @thefakeh yay another race fan
[4:07:07] <%SoFarFetched> The cat
[4:07:09] <%Sphincter_Spelunker> @Kataguro oh boy, I saw a guy go nuts defending TLJ on the subreddit. Nobody won that day
[4:07:16] <MilletDumplings> @PeachSaliva when is Pat doing trident dance?
[4:07:16] <+Jekado> @FirearmsInstructor the cat in the middle eh's the star
[4:07:30] <%QueequegTheater> @dabeaminator I just don't like people implying I'm not a true fan because I don't subscribe to their specific idea of what Star Wars should be
[4:07:33] <Mister_McDerp> they added Rose because they were too scared to ship Finn with Poe
[4:07:35] <%Kinoskae> Is that a monitor in front of you that has chat on it?
[4:07:40] <+necrocannibal2> "BUT BABAAAAA"
[4:07:41] <+Jekado> OH HE HEARD
[4:07:41] <%Breakfast_Megapowers> Forever? Forever-ever? Forever-ever-ever?
[4:07:41] <%evilmagetim> No Paige, not forever

[4:07:56] <%dabeaminator> @QueequegTheater people parroting internet opinions instead of forming their own IS annoying, but you can't blame that for people disagreeing with you.
