[0:00:18] <%NWR_James> pretty far. like 1/3?
[0:00:19] <stigna1> Do people actually just drift about aimless on Twitch like tumbleweeds, looking for games of interest? I hear about those folks every now and then but it seems so alien to me.
[0:00:22] <+Skatedeandre> Is this a record?
[0:00:23] <+CuteKitkat> YEAH YEAH YEAH
[0:00:27] <megamonmon123> i love yoi peach

[0:00:51] <megamonmon123> when i was younger
[0:00:51] <arcaderabbit48> @stigna1 Its basically like flipping through the channels on TV trying to find something to watch
[0:00:51] <cherubsanonymous> Weehoooo

[0:01:03] <stigna1> Huh, neat. I suppose that makes sense. Thanks for enlightening me!
[0:01:14] <arcaderabbit48> No problem :)
[0:01:15] <Tucker0603> this is great timing, paige playing this after i just finished the first vod, the day before I leave for college
[0:01:19] <megamonmon123> i wonder if paige will reveal her pregnancy this stream?
[0:01:25] <cerberuscarmine> XD
[0:01:29] <Mr_LupLup> And then those people get pissy when the random streamer they find dont play the game like they do
[0:01:32] <%craig_t> death announcement stream
[0:01:35] <+anar_bael> BIG AND STRONG
[0:01:36] <stigna1> @Tucker0603 Best of luck out there! You'll do great. :)
[0:01:40] <PessimisticOptimism> If youâ€™re in college then youâ€™re in college still. Hawwwwww hawwwwwww
[0:01:40] <7thnightingale> N E A T
[0:01:44] <jeecay> Pat is a muppet
[0:01:53] <+Shikari21> Oh boy im so excited
[0:01:53] <doki776> ya!
[0:01:56] <TeamSe7yn> YEYEYEYEYEYEYE
[0:01:56] <megamonmon123> @mr_luplup it's understandable to feel that way but you dont have to be a jerk about it
[0:01:59] <+Blargimazombie> Yeyeyeye
[0:02:01] <benjiFG> did they do co-op or are they waiting until after they beat the game?
[0:02:05] <megamonmon123> i mean we do it to paige when she plays portal
[0:02:11] <Tucker0603> @stigna1 ty, second semester there
[0:02:12] <ziggythehutt> Why am I watching the Galaxy Note fortnite ad
[0:02:13] <PessimisticOptimism> wait until youâ€™re unemployed AFTER college even stem degrees
[0:02:14] <megamonmon123> or any game that haa puzzles
[0:02:18] <+Shikari21> i can be up all night for this apatDab apatDab apatDab
[0:02:20] <DonatelloJose> They are doing SOLO first
[0:02:23] <arcaderabbit48> @benjiFG They seem to be waiting, Paige started story mode last tiem
[0:02:28] <stigna1> @benjiFG They did a twitter pol, solo won. Possible co-op after but nothing concrete.
[0:02:30] <megamonmon123> paige solo stream?
[0:02:31] <hntronium> How long for her to do the easy puzzles I wonder
[0:02:33] <benjiFG> thanks
[0:02:34] <+Blargimazombie> This portal series is basically "how can this be, it's impossible" the game
[0:02:35] <%GoCoSpace> sipsipHonk sipsipHonk sipsipHonk
[0:02:36] <Mr_LupLup> @megamonmon123 Yeah indeed, but actually yelling that that random streamer doesnt play the way they like is so weird to me
[0:02:37] <%TheFilth> god damn I logged onto twitch at the right time
[0:02:42] <+redeq2> apatDab apatDab apatDab apatDab apatDab
[0:02:44] <morat2255> Paige has to show Glados who's boss before they do coop
[0:02:47] <megamonmon123> that sounds naughy
[0:02:50] <alwayspronking> YEYEYEYE
[0:02:53] <GMAN_SECTOR> donutoFURMISSILE donutoFURMISSILE donutoFURMISSILE
[0:02:56] <%RadicalWeegee> wooo
[0:02:56] <%TeamSe7yn> woo
[0:02:59] <megamonmon123> @mr_luplup yeah you shouldn't yell
[0:03:01] <Prevot> I'm not sure co-op would even work, Paige is too "not-smart" compared to Pat
[0:03:06] <PessimisticOptimism> get on with it
[0:03:08] <+Shikari21> I belive in Paige and her lupus brain apatDab apatDab
[0:03:11] <megamonmon123> paige would make pat so mad
[0:03:12] <arcaderabbit48> Can't wait to see Paige accidentally solve a bunch of super hard puzzles, only to get stuck on a very obvious hole in the wall!
[0:03:19] <druvirus> excuse you, paige is both big AND strong
[0:03:21] <cerberuscarmine> naaah co op will be fine!
[0:03:25] <Mr_LupLup> no-yell-stream
[0:03:30] <+Squdnate> Followrs only mode was active ðŸ‘€
[0:03:31] <+redeq2> apatDab apatPat
[0:03:32] <morat2255> @Prevot There's a dedicated "hey idiot, over here" button in coop
[0:03:36] <blackbaron98> paige was pushing it last time
[0:03:38] <%bluetocho13> big yell stream
[0:03:38] <+anar_bael> Co op is too strong, not even air horn can help
[0:03:39] <+Skatedeandre> If it was co op pat would just solo puzzles Kappa
[0:03:41] <AncelDeLambert> here we go
[0:03:43] <SophisticHades> oh boy!
[0:03:43] <megamonmon123> will pat get upset and paige eating wcdonalds today?
[0:03:50] <PessimisticOptimism> coop will be pat and Paige play Sonic 2 coop second gig
[0:03:50] <+skizzuto> apatDab What's up everyone apatDab
[0:03:56] <Prevot> @morat2255 yeah but watching Pat solve everything on his own isn't fun
[0:04:01] <$magicalhades> hello today friends
[0:04:02] <cerberuscarmine> peach is sick so probably was the mc donald
[0:04:02] <stigna1> And Pat's done it, presumably. It'd end up with either Pat bossing everyone around or sitting back and letting Paige lead but that leaves her with playing Portal but with four portals, two people and two veiwpoints. And that seems like a lot of hasstle.
[0:04:06] <AncelDeLambert> oh god, corporations are using Fortnite to sell phones, end this world
[0:04:07] <megamonmon123> also we should get a portal 2nd gig
[0:04:11] <%NWR_James> only if the wcdonalds wasnt ordered before the stream and they have to stop or she tosses the trash on the floor
[0:04:14] <Mr_LupLup> Remember back in the day when Matt pretended to be super dumb? Thats basically how co-op is really gonna go down with this
[0:04:27] <sangi53> !uptime
[0:04:33] <megamonmon123> @anceldelambert why? its just a very popular game
[0:04:33] <PumaOfDarkness> Did Elmo break things again?
[0:04:34] <+Skatedeandre> Pretended?
[0:04:37] <AncelDeLambert> last stream was literally her as old Matt fully half the time
[0:04:39] <PessimisticOptimism> heh heh I made them think I was stupid. Little do they know
[0:04:39] <stigna1> I rewatched that 2snacks vid after Pat did the smooth jazz gag last stream. Still good stuff.
[0:04:42] <Gehtingsberg> Watching this on ps4
[0:04:43] <megamonmon123> i dont get why people get so mad that things are popular
[0:04:50] <druvirus> Elmo only makes things better. For him.
[0:04:54] <+patriotrenegade> LATE
[0:04:55] <+PipIV> I tapped out sleeping last time, how far did she make it?
[0:04:58] <PessimisticOptimism> idk fortnite is shit
[0:05:05] <Mr_LupLup> I like to think he pretended...
[0:05:07] <PumaOfDarkness> You're not even wrong.
[0:05:07] <PessimisticOptimism> better brace for the rage
[0:05:09] <+Skatedeandre> @megamonmon123 donâ€™t let it bug you too much
[0:05:09] <cerberuscarmine> i play fortnite im just not in the mood today
[0:05:10] <ape_hawk> DID SOMEONE SAY FORTNITE?!
[0:05:13] <cerberuscarmine> and i got an ad for it XD
[0:05:23] <zal_silverfang> as far as i remember paige is in the laser segment of puzzles
[0:05:23] <Mr_LupLup> Whats a forwardnight
[0:05:25] <+Shikari21> no fortnite is bad
[0:05:30] <druvirus> It isn't that people get mad about popular things. It's that people get mad about shitty trends leaking into normie spaces.
[0:05:37] <+PipIV> what's two week night?
[0:05:42] <+generalve> YEAA
[0:05:43] <zal_silverfang> wait no, she made it to the parents bit
[0:05:44] <DracaenaLeaf> yay sound
[0:05:45] <cherubsanonymous> Fortnite isn't bad because it's popular, it's bad because it's Fortnite
[0:05:46] <AncelDeLambert> YEYEYEYEYEYEYE

[0:06:17] <zal_silverfang> @DigbyMayor yeah, i remembered where right after. it's been a late night
[0:06:21] <Mr_LupLup> Did you guys see that fortnite straight up ripped the praise the sun emote
[0:06:23] <megamonmon123> ive never hated a game so much that seeing it other places pissed me off
[0:06:37] <megamonmon123> @pessimisticoptimism yeah cause other games NEVER do that
[0:06:45] <%Kravedarknesss> Time for the burning gears sipsipGears sipsipGears
[0:06:49] <megamonmon123> its not like AAA gaming trives on that or anything
[0:06:50] <PessimisticOptimism> @megamonmon123 thank you
[0:06:53] <AncelDeLambert> I guess that's part of it? The people who play fortnite are not the ones BUYING the phone, so what's the point of the marketing?
[0:07:00] <+PipIV> BrÃ¼tal lÃ¶Ã¶ps
[0:07:07] <cerberuscarmine> well they made their own praise the sun emote
[0:07:07] <leole11> where did she ended last stream?
[0:07:07] <megamonmon123> @anceldelambert to catch people who arent aware
[0:07:08] <+Skatedeandre> I mean every emote in fort nite is ripped from some where sooooo
[0:07:12] <cerberuscarmine> its not really the emote
[0:07:12] <zal_silverfang> bigger point. why play fortnite on a phone?
[0:07:13] <megamonmon123> thats the whole point of ads
[0:07:23] <AncelDeLambert> the ones who don't even know what the dancing guy on the phone is?
[0:07:24] <koolaid6677> Hello today!!!
[0:07:26] <megamonmon123> @zal_silverfang cauae you dont have a console or good pc
[0:07:27] <PessimisticOptimism> fortnite invented Jake Paul
[0:07:34] <Mr_LupLup> Its still weird how they pretend the praise the sun emote is not exactly that
[0:07:39] <%SoarFlyer> Man I just finished watching the VOD of the last session oh BOY
[0:07:40] <PessimisticOptimism> Jake Paul invented dabbing
[0:07:43] <%DonatelloJose> Remember everybody, we're encouraging today. NO MATTER how bad it gets... sipsipSipsipblind
[0:07:51] <+Skatedeandre> Donâ€™t pin YouTubes crimes on fortnite moon2A
[0:07:52] <Mr_LupLup> Jake Paul invented suicide via rope
[0:07:53] <Cheapheatmo> leole11 after the puzzle with the 3 laser receivers, I think 2 chambers before The Surprise
[0:07:55] <%SoarFlyer> @DonatelloJose I don't understand
[0:07:58] <megamonmon123> like its just a game. hating it that much that just seeing anything related to it is really not health
[0:08:03] <megamonmon123> *healthy
[0:08:05] <leole11> @Cheapheatmo Thanks fam
[0:08:06] <GMAN_SECTOR> YES this is an ENCOURAGEMENT stream
[0:08:07] <PessimisticOptimism> Logan did that but their dad kisses teens
[0:08:13] <+PipIV> ok. encouraging. we can... do that
[0:08:23] <+lutefiiisk> man theres been a stream every day this week. my sleep schedual is fucked.
[0:08:28] <cerberuscarmine> pat invented and made dabbing cool
[0:08:28] <$magicalhades> we wholesome strim?
[0:08:29] <Mr_LupLup> I dont know who is who, since theyre all equally stupid
[0:08:30] <megamonmon123> paige you can beat this game before i die!
[0:08:33] <+Skatedeandre> @megamonmon123 people have been doing this with other games since forever
[0:08:34] <%SoarFlyer> Paige can't be worse this stream than she already has!
[0:08:34] <+PipIV> What is sleep?
[0:08:35] <cerberuscarmine> with his big dabs
[0:08:36] <+patriotrenegade> Its the worst its ever been EVERY SINGLE STREAM
[0:08:39] <%DonatelloJose> @lutefiiisk I feel you.
[0:08:43] <Prevot> do you think she already had mcdonalds, or is she gonna order it on stream?
[0:08:43] <megamonmon123> paige you can do it eventually!
[0:08:46] <druvirus> To be fair, I don't hate it just because of the game. I feel that way about anything shitty doing weird ass product placement
[0:08:53] <+generalve> STOP THE REPLAY
[0:08:53] <+patriotrenegade> LOOP
[0:08:55] <Mr_LupLup> @Prevot Why not both?
[0:08:57] <+brave_sj> Oh no, not the puzzles!
[0:08:57] <megamonmon123> @druvirus thats fair
[0:09:00] <AncelDeLambert> Uh oh, Elmo ate the cords
[0:09:03] <PessimisticOptimism> I wonder if Paige ate BEFORE THE STREAM lol
[0:09:03] <cerberuscarmine> i think peach passed out
[0:09:04] <Ell1ot> song looped! stream borken
[0:09:07] <+generalve> ELOMO noooooooooooo
[0:09:08] <druvirus> If 2 Broke Girl tried to sell me a Toyota I'd be like "What is this shit"
[0:09:13] <%Freelance7> He has absorbed the equipment
[0:09:13] <druvirus> *Girls
[0:09:14] <$magicalhades> elmo ate the entire stream, even the chat
[0:09:20] <AMajorTom> do you think Paige re-broke the mic setup?
[0:09:23] <cerberuscarmine> elmo vore
[0:09:25] <%Freelance7> We now live inside Elmo, we should be grateful
[0:09:25] <Mr_LupLup> God do I hate being eaten
[0:09:33] <%Remery_> sipsipSipsipblind
[0:09:36] <+patriotrenegade> Pat probably broke keyboard and mouse support
[0:09:38] <TheInkshow> Ey, whats AUI?
[0:09:39] <megamonmon123> what if paige's stand is breaking things
[0:09:40] <+Skatedeandre> But the phone pushing makes sense though
[0:09:45] <AncelDeLambert> Elmo is protesting, he demands this be The Baby stream, and nothing else
[0:09:47] <megamonmon123> and her stand broke her body
[0:09:48] <+PipIV> apatBig WAIT
[0:09:48] <TheInkshow> Just finish the other archive stream
[0:09:51] <leole11> *smacks top of the stream* this bad boy can hold so many burning gears
[0:09:52] <PessimisticOptimism> muffins are cakes
[0:09:56] <DigbyMayor> Kya~ don't swallow Elmo-kun
[0:09:57] <AndySoryu> if i see something i dont like at random points in my life i will eventually hate it more
[0:10:05] <druvirus> Paige's stand is fixing difficult things while breaking simple things.
[0:10:05] <zal_silverfang> @megamonmon123 but, we dont even know what her stand is. how can we counter the unknown?
[0:10:08] <PessimisticOptimism> bagels are donuts
[0:10:11] <+SailingSaturn> Whew just in time cirTan
[0:10:14] <+PipIV> *quick bread
[0:10:18] <DigbyMayor> Her stand is lupus
[0:10:25] <+Skatedeandre> No the fuck they arenâ€™t
[0:10:26] <+brave_sj> What music is this? It's killing me how familiar it is, but I can't place it
[0:10:26] <$Mendin> I've heard her stand called Komm Susser Todd before
[0:10:27] <$magicalhades> bagels are not donuts l
[0:10:30] <+Skatedeandre> moon2A
[0:10:35] <AncelDeLambert> Muffins indeed are cakes
[0:10:37] <+SailingSaturn> Maybe Elmo is her Automatic Stand
[0:10:37] <DigbyMayor> It's like Holly's stand where she just dies
[0:10:40] <PessimisticOptimism> Iâ€™m polarizing yay
[0:10:40] <%SSaryn> !muffindebate
[0:10:46] <leole11> Hotdogs are Sandwiches
[0:10:50] <Mr_LupLup> Yes, her stand is lupus, and it manifests like with the character Unknown from tekken tag tournament
[0:10:53] <druvirus> Paige is the kind of person who accidentally leaves moldy WcDonalds out, thus inventing penicillin.
[0:10:54] <graemecrackers1> Lupis looming

[0:12:26] <+Tokanova> is this the 5th loop?
[0:12:27] <@MelBrooksKA> Can I get more loops brother?
[0:12:27] <Fujiwara_92> fuck, i didnt watch the other vod yet
[0:12:28] <jeecay> I can't stay for the stream...cause work. be sure to remind pat that he is in fact a muppet for me stream
[0:12:29] <+Tokanova> 7th loop?
[0:12:29] <DigbyMayor> Maybe they think they're live and have been talking the whole time
[0:12:30] <cerberuscarmine> what you guys talkin about? this is the stream
[0:12:32] <megamonmon123> pat probably exposed his balls and now is having trouble putting them back into his pants
[0:12:33] <+Tokanova> 10th?
[0:12:33] <Gary_Plays_Games> man this stream intro is so damn good
[0:12:34] <+patriotrenegade> Portal 2: Second LOOP
[0:12:35] <Arweynn> I'm actually here at the start of a stream for once! :D
[0:12:37] <+generalve> you bot ass is 20 mins late girl atpCop atpLaw2 atpLaw2 atpLaw2 atpLaw2 atpLaw2 atpLaw2
[0:12:41] <stigna1> Folks, just because something is true does not make it "right." A loaf of bread is obvious a sandwich, much like how the following exchange is grammatically fine; "Who's the owner of the blue sedan?" "I'm!"
[0:12:43] <+Shikari21> I blame elmo
[0:12:46] <JZPotter> @novemberswan
[0:12:50] <%Kravedarknesss> did @PeachSaliva forget the stream?
[0:12:53] <PessimisticOptimism> True is right
[0:12:55] <jinkipng> Love the lÃ¶Ã¶ps
[0:12:56] <+Skatedeandre> Pat doesnâ€™t have the courage to show balls on stream
[0:12:58] <AncelDeLambert> Portal broke again, didn't it?
[0:12:59] <PessimisticOptimism> wrong is wrong
[0:13:00] <firemahci93> never blame da baby
[0:13:00] <stigna1> @Kravedarknesss Nah, technical issues.
[0:13:02] <corepool> maybe this is the stream
[0:13:06] <+Tokanova> this is the whole stream folks
[0:13:06] <leole11> Portal probably borke
[0:13:10] <PessimisticOptimism> good intentions are bad
[0:13:11] <%smokey1205> sipsipElmo
[0:13:13] <Mr_LupLup> it borked
[0:13:13] <%umbypokochan> truth isn't truth
[0:13:15] <+Tokanova> settle in for an hour of intro
[0:13:15] <Benpower236> If this loop weren't hype, I'd have a problem.
[0:13:16] <cerberuscarmine> tech issues and the peach is big sick
[0:13:17] <stigna1> Maybe the real stream was the friends we made in chat! ^_^
[0:13:18] <%Kravedarknesss> @stigna1 oh ok
[0:13:18] <zal_silverfang> here is one for you chat. a fully decked out sandwich is just a salad without a bowl
[0:13:23] <cerberuscarmine> :D
[0:13:24] <PessimisticOptimism> badminton is tennis
[0:13:24] <+Skatedeandre> The truth isnâ€™t the truth
[0:13:30] <megamonmon123> elmo probably got caught inbetween paige's horrible boots
[0:13:35] <+Skatedeandre> Thatâ€™s not even true
[0:13:35] <+bluemorning104> LATE
[0:13:39] <%NWR_James> Elmo has destroyed them. There is no one to stop the intro loop. It will play forever
[0:13:41] <leole11> @zal_silverfang you eat salads with forks, you eat sandwiches with your hands.
[0:13:42] <+PipIV> 1+1=3
[0:13:43] <PessimisticOptimism> vaccines cause adults
[0:13:45] <cerberuscarmine> the real stream is the next hollow knight stream out at Angriestpat on the twich
[0:13:52] <Prism_Wing> But nobody came.
[0:13:54] <cerberuscarmine> Kappa
[0:13:55] <Mr_LupLup> Autism causes vaccines

[0:14:35] <+Shikari21> Paige is waitng for her mcd
[0:14:38] <firemahci93> The stream is just the next step from talkin for 2 hours and not playing. it is only the intro song now
[0:14:38] <PessimisticOptimism> 1+1=1+1
[0:14:40] <+PipIV> this peach is a little ripe
[0:14:45] <Prevot> Some say that stream intro is still playing to this very day....
[0:14:48] <cerberuscarmine> im waiting for that as well @RadicalWeegee but im drawing starcraft porn XD
[0:14:49] <+TsundereHunter> Lol i just got here and was worried I'd miss some podcast
[0:14:49] <PessimisticOptimism> Itâ€™s trans
[0:14:54] <megamonmon123> has paige been on the podcast?
[0:14:56] <Mr_LupLup> Count the + as a digit
[0:15:01] <+Youwereeatenbyalid> DEAD
[0:15:02] <+generalve> NO NOT 4 REPLAYS
[0:15:02] <hntronium> Does anyone know if Paige and Plague got to watch more star trek

[0:15:08] <%NWR_James> What if they started and dont know the loop is still going
[0:15:09] <+Blargimazombie> Four?Yikes
[0:15:09] <%DonatelloJose> YES BROTHER
[0:15:10] <+Yumonikki> WutFace
[0:15:11] <+generalve> Like this song is good but only like on ce a week
[0:15:11] <megamonmon123> paige should be on the podcadt
[0:15:11] <+clausover> Stalling
[0:15:11] <+bluemorning104> paige hasn't been on the podcast because she's a coward
[0:15:12] <stigna1> Ok, let me expand on that. What is factual and correct is not always "felt" to be such by the humans that consider that truth, as the humans filter that fact through their own illogical preconceptions. This is how a lot of those "physics hacks" work. You can stop yourself from rotating by messing around with a tire, but it looks like witchcraft to people who don't get it. Same with the technical definition of sandwhiches.

[0:15:58] <fattness132> we get loops for 10 hours
[0:16:00] <DigbyMayor> this is just escalator world. "When do we get to the ride?" "This IS the ride!"

[0:16:08] <stigna1> @PessimisticOptimism No, it do be like it is. But people feel like that's wrong because they're wrong.

[0:16:19] <stigna1> Cake: "an item of soft, sweet food made from a mixture of flour, shortening, eggs, sugar, and other ingredients, baked and often decorated" So yes, cupcakes are cakes.

[0:16:39] <PessimisticOptimism> @stigna1 so a species with other senses is wrong because we canâ€™t sense what they can
