[0:21:49] <%AncelDeLambert> Mah-Ree-Oh
[0:22:01] <%patriotrenegade> RUN
[0:22:05] <SpookyMooks> reminds me of the Ornstein/Smoug arena
[0:22:08] <jetstreamlove_R> The creepy slodge monster from Pat's closet has come out to play!
[0:22:13] <anfiilookinsgood> sheeeesh
[0:22:15] <%orpleborple> wah
[0:22:17] <%peyodogo> that was a fair attempt
[0:22:18] <Scrub_Seeker> @SpookyMooks it IS their arena lol
[0:22:18] <mrjplays2k9> how many pulls has it been?
[0:22:18] <%SveriSageAdvice> those arrows follow and track, you'll have to run away
[0:22:18] <$NitronStreams> yuuuuuup
[0:22:18] <+ClericOfSparda> That gfot you on your first run
[0:22:19] <%JenovasPuppet> First try! Good job, boss!
[0:22:19] <%rumtumtugnutz> fukken nope
[0:22:21] <starkspawn> it is the arena
[0:22:21] <freelancebabymaker> wow this is a bad boss to start on lol
[0:22:22] <%patriotrenegade> @PeachSaliva If you see him take out his bow, RUN AND DONT STOP
[0:22:23] <RiverBirch> @SpookyMooks **Loud Cough**
[0:22:23] <B1ak3N1k05999> Ded
[0:22:23] <%Bt_Robot> Yeah, maybe run away from the arrows
[0:22:25] <@PatStaresAt> @PeachSaliva Hey sometimes he falls down and you can beat on him very bad
[0:22:25] <%peyodogo> aldritch is tofff
[0:22:25] <+RandyFistburgers> I got stuck on this boss for like two weeks ngl
[0:22:25] <%AncelDeLambert> SMITE
[0:22:25] <starkspawn> I think
[0:22:25] <BigFingerRo> Ok, so my money is on 10 attempts at least
[0:22:26] <xeroslash1> @SpookyMooks because it is that arena
[0:22:26] <+Etherealizer> that arrow move he does is legit the hardest thing in the game
[0:22:27] <%sick_kickflips> ah dang I missed the WAH
[0:22:28] <+RenoDeGeneric> And our arrows will block out the sun
[0:22:29] <%Idziman> riPepperonis

[0:22:33] <LeafarOz> pog Vordts hammer
[0:22:34] <+heyalright107> it is that arena man!
[0:22:34] <%nip_nips> Arrows: 2, Peach: 0
[0:22:41] <%JenovasPuppet> First Try 2: Try Harder
[0:22:45] <%AncelDeLambert> yeah the arrows are a pure "run the fuck away" segment
[0:22:46] <SpookyMooks> Huh, neat
[0:22:46] <%Ziegsy> what do you mean its not 'May- Rye- oh'?
[0:22:49] <%Rumbutt> @SveriSageAdvice Not yet, that's phase 2, in phase 1 it's just a cone
[0:22:49] <Sagata_> mortis
[0:22:51] <%MechArch> psaBougie
[0:22:52] <%patriotrenegade> Aldrich is resistant to frost and blunt lol
[0:22:56] <blackjack8182> First Try round 2
[0:22:58] <eyeobject> I believe in the arnj mustard lady
[0:23:01] <munitalprats> maybe switch to dark sword?
[0:23:12] <%SveriSageAdvice> @Rumbutt oh really? i didnt know that, i always ran lmao
[0:23:15] <+heyalright107> the Gwyndolin boss theme remix is so great
[0:23:22] <%AncelDeLambert> Paige you're not Sonic, you don't go faster the more you hit the roll button
[0:23:24] <%patriotrenegade> RUN
[0:23:25] <%VashyronM> just be big and strong
[0:23:28] <kikoeru_san> I can back that up, he is REALLY strong to ice
[0:23:31] <Coystick> He's so fucking cool, but his model/animations are a little jank
[0:23:32] <mrjplays2k9> lived pog
[0:23:36] <%athuramn> not that I think it'll help but she did get an Estus share a while back that I don't think she used
[0:23:36] <KeiganOfAstora> Does she have a back-up weapon for when frost doesn't work?
[0:23:38] <%Aeogard> Pog
[0:23:44] <SpookyMooks> Drink the pain away
[0:23:46] <munitalprats> @KeiganOfAstora pat set up a dark sword and shield of want for her.
[0:23:48] <anfiilookinsgood> always drink
[0:23:51] <+ClericOfSparda> I'm kinda impressed she survived
[0:23:53] <%nip_nips> you can unga bunga enough damage in phase 1 to not even need to worry about those arrows
[0:23:53] <%AncelDeLambert> kamehameHA
[0:23:55] <RiverBirch> HEy chat, dont worry about her hammer. She's nearly got it half way
[0:23:58] <+awkwardjoke> i too am constantly drinking
[0:24:02] <osuRohan> NGL this was the hardest boss for@me
[0:24:04] <+heyalright107> oh fuck, it's the god damn Vordt hammer
[0:24:05] <boomstickery> @KeiganOfAstora she doesnt have a back up plan of any kind
[0:24:07] <Coystick> She said the C-tier gamer word
[0:24:11] <cs0402196> I don't think that was what she meant by 'Stitch This'.
[0:24:23] <President_Pariah> the first thing I hear when turning on the stream is "shitballs! tits! RUUNN!" LUL
[0:24:24] <mrjplays2k9> anyone know off hand how many attempts Pat and Woolie needed?
[0:24:24] <%Rumbutt> phase 2
[0:24:25] <%patriotrenegade> yeah she got this
[0:24:25] <Guardiansaiyan> JUST got here
[0:24:28] <%orpleborple> shotsshotsshots
[0:24:28] <Guardiansaiyan> tfoxy Paige
[0:24:32] <kikoeru_san> Aldrich is weak to Thrust, Fire, and Thunder, with Fire being the best imo
[0:24:38] <SpookyMooks> wow the bait
[0:24:39] <%Bt_Robot> When running away, consider the Prometheus principle, 90 degree angles
[0:24:39] <Coystick> Good fucking try though
[0:24:41] <KeiganOfAstora> Fire is definitely best
[0:24:41] <BigFingerRo> that's attempt 3
[0:24:42] <+RandyFistburgers> @osuRohan Agreed, the raining arrows attack that tracks always got me
[0:24:47] <%Agami23> your doing great
[0:24:48] <%Lion_kun> that was unlucky doing that attack twice in a row
[0:24:50] <$Puhff> yeah he sux
[0:24:53] <freelancebabymaker> nah not bad at all just keep trying
[0:24:53] <%AncelDeLambert> hey, he's at 40%
[0:24:53] <peachy996> We don't know about Woolie, Pat took the reigns on DS3
[0:24:53] <+babushkakoi> Nice Fight!
[0:24:55] <CzeekyTV> 2nd try and halfway is great
[0:24:56] <%peyodogo> lets go big strong
[0:24:59] <BigFingerRo> I'm thinking 10 attempts
[0:25:00] <blackjack8182> Aldrich’s arrow storm is such bs
[0:25:00] <%VashyronM> I'm amused that a lord of cinder is weak to fire
[0:25:01] <%Ziegsy> Old rick has the works case of hemorrhoids ive ever seen
[0:25:01] <@MelBrooksKA> Second first half way try
[0:25:02] <Guardiansaiyan> those eyes!
[0:25:06] <%patriotrenegade> @PeachSaliva Did you know animals that will use hamster wheels in the wild include rabbits, mice, rats and slugs
[0:25:07] <cache_22> Is it better to dodge left and right rather than towards and away?
[0:25:09] <B1ak3N1k05999> Yeah
[0:25:14] <+heyalright107> yeah not bad at all
[0:25:15] <RiverBirch> @BigFingerRo I'm thinking under 10.
[0:25:16] <blackjack8182> First Try Part 3
[0:25:20] <+babushkakoi> FIGHT ON! BIG AND STRONG!
[0:25:21] <%Sadira_snack_attack> fat and sassy? a dangerous combo
[0:25:24] <anfiilookinsgood> we can tell she not wearing her glasses still :P
[0:25:34] <kikoeru_san> the worst time I ever had in this game was fighting Dancer at a low level, bleed ftw
[0:25:40] <boomstickery> do you feel your v tuber is you or her own character?
[0:25:46] <%nip_nips> dancer is gonna break her
[0:25:49] <%patriotrenegade> Fun fact: Aldrich's arrow attack can kill every boss in the game
[0:25:56] <@MelBrooksKA> THE THREE Bs!
[0:26:00] <%Aeogard> im actually pretty surprised at how good the rigging is
[0:26:01] <peachy996> It's not the best
[0:26:02] <munitalprats> after this boss Paige has to do the Greirat quest part
[0:26:04] <%Ranryu692> yes
[0:26:04] <Junk> Hahaha now EVERY game company is the worst in the industry
[0:26:06] <%patriotrenegade> smushed
[0:26:06] <Coystick> The answer is "yes"
[0:26:07] <munitalprats> wait
[0:26:07] <%Sadira_snack_attack> Oh dont worry Im sure EA has its own scandal brewing
[0:26:09] <%Aeogard> paige is her own OC
[0:26:09] <B1ak3N1k05999> They still are
[0:26:10] <kikoeru_san> Dancer is gonna FUCK Paige up, or Paige is gonna FUCK her up
[0:26:10] <mr_saturday93> why thr fuck is twitch giving me a ad during a live stream?
[0:26:10] <+Ynkubus_> Paige is a character
[0:26:11] <peachy996> Just third worst at this point
[0:26:11] <theredlegend23222> she really has the ears
[0:26:12] <mrjplays2k9> the existential question distracted you
[0:26:14] <BigFingerRo> that's 3
[0:26:15] <ergulor> the answer is death
[0:26:17] <%Bt_Robot> It's like the Clark Kent to her Superman
[0:26:17] <+RandyFistburgers> Attention is for losers
[0:26:20] <$Puhff> is this your Sonic Highschool OC????
[0:26:20] <munitalprats> isn't Greirat like, super dead?
[0:26:22] <cache_22> Paige is Peach and Peach is Paige.
[0:26:25] <BigFingerRo> we got one hattrick
[0:26:26] <+polothegreatest> OC, donut steal

[0:26:29] <Coystick> It's her DnD character
[0:26:30] <SGrim> @PeachSaliva pro-tip for staying alive: keep your health points above zero.
[0:26:31] <+AnthonyJMax> PERSONA
[0:26:33] <%LysdexicAndVolingit> Paige doesn't play a character; she is a character!
[0:26:34] <@MelBrooksKA> PERSONA!
[0:26:34] <%patriotrenegade> Greirat is probably dead
[0:26:36] <Wiiplayah43> @PeachSaliva you ARE a character. SeemsGood

[1:02:09] <%CubicPhantom> snuffy's models are great
[1:02:12] <$Puhff> When you gonna get that Miko upgrade?????
[1:02:13] <President_Pariah> it's okay to be a slack jawed yokel, embrace it
[1:02:14] <pabloelenano2> silver model also is great
[1:02:14] <Finakala> Snuffy and Girl_DM both have absurdly good models
[1:02:14] <%Agami23> snuffy and girldm have fucking crazy models.
[1:02:15] <%LysdexicAndVolingit> Cause shit costs lotta money
[1:02:15] <%nip_nips> leech time
[1:02:17] <+Emperor_Z> Snuffy and GirlDM's models are both done by TheArtGun. Are there any other artists on that level?
[1:02:19] <+Masked_Hero_Lucky> Snuffy's model is crazy, so is Froot's.
[1:02:19] <$standby_for_titanfall> isn't the whole industry of this stuff like less than 10 years old too???
[1:02:20] <%patriotrenegade> WORTHLESS
[1:02:29] <BigYanno> don't forget maggots
[1:02:29] <%Agami23> my friend has a similar insane model with the super cool face tech
[1:02:29] <infinityk11> Snuffy is awesome
[1:02:30] <%ItalianWaifu> use tourch to get rid of worms
[1:02:35] <Finakala> Brian Tsui's models are also stupid good, like Bao
[1:02:36] <+Gondab> She dosn't notice
[1:02:40] <Wiiplayah43> Because models & rigs are made by different people, so it's silly to expect uniform quality. LUL
[1:02:41] <$Puhff> Yeah Miko uses a full mocap suit so I dont blame you
[1:02:44] <Hydrapissed> Torch
[1:02:44] <korean_random> when Pat is gonna get his vtuber model?
[1:02:48] <jetstreamlove_R> Pat is a good gremlin husband
[1:02:48] <+cdrom321> Are the DS9 videos on Picarto?
[1:02:48] <rekinom> Make sure you get your vtubers wormed, folks
[1:02:50] <President_Pariah> Miko is like lightyears ahead
[1:02:53] <Finakala> hikaru14Excite
[1:02:53] <%Kenzo2000> Nyanners new 3d is incredible, you can almost read her lips
[1:02:53] <PettyFunk> Oh yeah, isn't Miko's something obscenely complicated she built herself?
[1:02:57] <%g0atmeal> equip torch to kill worms
[1:02:57] <+FackinCrazy> Like nyanners just got her snuffy level rig like a week ago so give Paige a break
[1:03:00] <PanicSwytch> Miko's costs over $15,000
[1:03:04] <+dayz1003> yeah miko has the suit she wears right?
[1:03:04] <$AzureGale> ! BLOOD LOSS !
[1:03:06] <%Lion_kun> how obtrusive is the rig?
[1:03:07] <%MoonObscure> kinda miss old nyaners
[1:03:08] <thelonechris> Those guys got worms in their orders
[1:03:10] <+Wackywhitney> when are you gonna be interviewed by CodeMiko?
[1:03:11] <Finakala> Mousey has a LOT of models
[1:03:11] <cyclone722> theartgun is powerful
[1:03:12] <eyeobject> Happy anniversery, you're a anime now!
[1:03:13] <munitalprats> drink oj
[1:03:14] <Jaysky> Snuffy's model is my favorite of probably any vtuber, at least the less adult version. Nyanners is very wiggly wobbly too
[1:03:15] <+Masked_Hero_Lucky> Yeah, Mousey has a great 3D model
[1:03:17] <%CubicPhantom> ironmouse has like 5 models right now
[1:03:18] <SaltkeyAndAckfish> is the rig intrusive?
[1:03:20] <Wiiplayah43> @PettyFunk Don't think she built it herself, that would be news to me
[1:03:20] <%SharkMissile> ironmouse is such a delightful goblin
[1:03:21] <$standby_for_titanfall> here's the thing, it's not the tech that matters it's personality
[1:03:23] <B1ak3N1k05999> She does
[1:03:23] <Spudnacious_Dynasty> Equip torch to unequip worms
[1:03:26] <jetstreamlove_R> it's mesmerizing for sure
[1:03:28] <jackalias> Ironmouse rocks
[1:03:29] <leilahlunar> no twitching on twitch, got it
[1:03:30] <Storm_Samurai> It's ok booba is responsive
[1:03:35] <Finakala> ironmouseCheer
[1:03:36] <%Agami23> mousey is a digimon with how much she changes models and looks, its amazing
[1:03:38] <mario_Sif> ironmouse on Cali stream was great
[1:03:39] <%peyodogo> thats okay tbh, this is a rad model
[1:03:41] <pretendofriendo> I appreciate the DS2 gear set
[1:03:41] <%SilvaChariot0133> Pour one out for Mousey's internet nyannSadge
[1:03:42] <+emperordread> You and Pat got me intop Nyanners <3
[1:03:42] <munitalprats> don't you start with the dusting of wets
[1:03:44] <%nip_nips> big blind
[1:03:45] <mrjplays2k9> no torch?
[1:03:48] <Copious_Koopies> they have the rig, you have the rack
[1:03:51] <%Bt_Robot> USE RED MOSS IF YOU HAVE IT
[1:03:52] <%Ziegsy> i really want to get a model done, but id just want the bust
[1:03:53] <scht3v3> Wets: dusted
[1:03:54] <jetstreamlove_R> Love it when she speaks spanish it's adorable
[1:03:55] <devanmuse> She has so many models and a nasty habit of leaking them early on stream
[1:03:55] <DrkJP520> does the rig support winking?
[1:03:56] <%ClericOfSparda> You walked past 2 doors
[1:03:58] <$Puhff> that's true; i've seen really vtube rigs on really boring streamers
[1:03:58] <%Grimlockfly> I made an ultra simple vtuber for a friend, it’s just simple eyes and mouth flaps. I’m just glad I didn’t have to put it together for it to work.
[1:04:00] <%Bt_Robot> FOR THE BLEEDING
[1:04:03] <%SharkMissile> @peachsaliva what about Porp?
[1:04:03] <%JenovasPuppet> Torches are for cowards! This is a no light run.
[1:04:03] <+Wackywhitney> it's been so long since I've watched your streams and I'm so excited seeing your virtual avatar!

[1:04:21] <cyclone722> a sad

[1:04:27] <%Bt_Robot> WHAT? IT'S A CUTE BABY DRAGON!
[1:04:28] <jackalias> I kind of want to make a super lazy vtuber model, just a stick figure I spent 5 minutes on.
[1:04:28] <ergulor> the dog rat baby
[1:04:28] <%TrashManJonesy> it's scared
[1:04:29] <pretendofriendo> it's not attacking

[1:04:36] <%nip_nips> he is friendo
[1:04:37] <+cdrom321> Can't talk but won't attack.
[1:04:37] <HaroldDonchee> kill that monster
[1:04:38] <+Ynkubus_> this one friend
[1:04:40] <pretendofriendo> ITS PASSIVE

[1:04:41] <+dirtyh4rr1> pet it with your hammer
[1:04:43] <BigYanno> He'll hurt you by being gross
[1:04:44] <%g0atmeal> door by the monster
[1:04:46] <Coystick> That's what Zangief looks like if you shave him
[1:04:48] <mrjplays2k9> OCELOTTE
[1:04:50] <Jaysky> Nyanners consistently cracks me up
[1:05:00] <SaltkeyAndAckfish> @Coystick LUL dear god
[1:05:04] <+Emperor_Z> I fantasize about Vtubing, but I'm almost certain I'm not entertaining enough
[1:05:04] <Finakala> Is there anything Pat hasn't played these days
[1:05:05] <$standby_for_titanfall> Korone #1 foreva
[1:05:18] <%nip_nips> go past friendo
[1:05:19] <%patriotrenegade> you were literally there
[1:05:19] <cyclone722> I had to take my headphones off for every item I picked up in here.
[1:05:23] <%patriotrenegade> go back
[1:05:24] <%ClericOfSparda> Go back to the baby thing
[1:05:24] <%g0atmeal> go back to creepy thing

[1:05:34] <someyounguy1> his tastes are as well rounded as he is
[1:05:34] <valriot> Tell him to finish Nioh huehue
[1:05:35] <%Kenzo2000> I need another day of the week to stay up to date on all my anime girl streamers
[1:05:42] <DrkJP520> Variety is the spice of life
[1:05:44] <brisk_dacat> does he play dateing sims
[1:05:45] <%CubicPhantom> I guess Pat is well-rounded then?
[1:05:45] <%nip_nips> babby friendo is progress
[1:05:47] <Finakala> @Emperor_Z You can just use a static image to try it out, a lot of vtubers start out that way and develop from there
[1:05:55] <B1ak3N1k05999> She good
[1:05:55] <BigFingerRo> @standby_for_titanfall weird way to spell Nene, guy
[1:05:56] <$Puhff> Believe it or not, that horrible baby/dragon thing is actually chock full of lore!
[1:05:59] <A_Cat_Herder> Oh wow, I haven't been in stream since the vtuber avatar was introduced. How long has she been anime?

[1:06:54] <%vVAstrAVv> all the keys are here just look around better
[1:06:56] <+Emperor_Z> Baby-face monster loves his wall, and doesn't care about nothin' else
[1:07:01] <%VexicBayn> "to beat the boss shoot it until it dies"
[1:07:05] <Finakala> I love how this place is just Latria 2

[1:07:23] <%VexicBayn> mouth move good
[1:07:24] <Coystick> @Puhff Yeah they conspicuously look alike, but I don't remember seeing anything pairing them lorewise
[1:07:25] <%LysdexicAndVolingit> I think people are expecting too much
[1:07:25] <+delilah4you> Where are your GLASSES WOMAN
[1:07:26] <%3d_pbandj> nah its fine
[1:07:27] <ergulor> unless you're eating ham
[1:07:28] <BigYanno> BEHOLD THE MOST POINTLESS SHORTCUT
[1:07:29] <mrjplays2k9> it just says WAH WAH often
[1:07:29] <%vVAstrAVv> i dont think so
[1:07:31] <Jaysky> @standby_for_titanfall Don't you mean Super Hyper Ultra Ultimate Deluxe Perfect Amazing Shining 流派東方不敗 Master Freedom Galaxy Nenechi?
[1:07:31] <+Wackywhitney> people just be nitpicky
[1:07:32] <CrimsonFox777> Maybe a little, but whatever
[1:07:32] <%ItalianWaifu> no big deal though
[1:07:33] <biglomix> No all Vtuber lips are off you have to set an audio delay to get it to sync
[1:07:33] <Wiiplayah43> not "off", just delayed
[1:07:33] <%peyodogo> they're fine tbh
[1:07:33] <%Grimlockfly> Ur fine
[1:07:34] <President_Pariah> mouth is less than a second off
[1:07:34] <%VashyronM> maybe for next stream, but I wouldn't worry about it now
[1:07:34] <pi_in_the_sci> You need to calibrate, you're slack-jawed
[1:07:35] <$standby_for_titanfall> ........your gameplay could use some work tho lol jk
[1:07:35] <%3d_pbandj> Its a good mouth
[1:07:43] <PanicSwytch> Are u using an Iphone for face tracking?
[1:07:47] <%nip_nips> @pi_in_the_sci thats it capturing accurately
[1:07:47] <%vVAstrAVv> they forgot youre a goldfish
[1:07:49] <Coystick> @Puhff is it just the "becoming a dragon" thing?
[1:07:49] <TheUglyNakWoo> They off, its just funny looking. Like you're perpetually trying to suck something LUL
[1:07:49] <B1ak3N1k05999> It’s good. Chat is messing with you
[1:07:56] <bevyrage> it's an issue with your camera's hrz iirc, you'll basically need a super high quality camera to have on point lip movements unless you get the full mocap rig
[1:08:02] <SomeOtherNeb> good evening chat, good evening Giant Paige
[1:08:02] <%JenovasPuppet> Stop ladies from looking at you

[1:08:31] <+RD_NX> they lower your stats as well, if you roll there's a good chance you'll fat-roll
[1:08:31] <%Lion_kun> Paige, when your healthbar gets low run away until it comes back

[1:09:08] <sydowoodo> why sad?????
[1:09:14] <BigFingerRo> Man, imagine how fucking sadistic itd be if you lost the lifebar until you died

[1:10:55] <%walternatorz> wcdonalds
[1:10:59] <Spudnacious_Dynasty> I think there's one more tiny area past Aldrich that you didn't explore.

[1:13:22] <munitalprats> SHAMK
[1:13:22] <Zaphire_Saucypants> I mean...it's still worth reading it tho. It ended in a perfect place, I think.

[1:36:00] <%patriotrenegade> @PeachSaliva ok Paige, once again you dont have to fight the ladies, you opened a shortcut to avoid them
[1:36:01] <$Puhff> DBD time!
[1:36:01] <pi_in_the_sci> There's never any reason to heal against those guys
[1:36:02] <%JoshManVGH> Just in time to see a fox goddess get branded
[1:36:04] <%AncelDeLambert> Paige, I know you hate it, but perhaps you should consider ranged options
[1:36:04] <@Jekado> hmm why is the animation on it seem off?
[1:36:05] <Melchior_the_Wise> nice fangs girl
[1:36:07] <%MechArch> remember shortcut
[1:36:11] <Wiiplayah43> @Melchior_the_Wise Midwestern, even though she insists she's Southern.
[1:36:17] <+Ches_Neckbeard> Paige you can't claim to be southern and not inbred. you have to pick!
[1:36:19] <%patriotrenegade> go right and STRAIGHT
[1:36:20] <%nip_nips> go to the very end of the hall and out the window
[1:36:21] <%CzeekyTV> right out the gate and go to the end

[1:36:24] <TheUglyNakWoo> off topic question here but will you be watching DS9 with plague tonight?
[1:36:31] <Melchior_the_Wise> when did she claim to be southern>?
[1:36:31] <pi_in_the_sci> end of the hall, take a right

[1:37:10] <%JoshManVGH> the lipsflaps are flapping
[1:37:15] <$Sphincter_Spelunker> sup nerds. I didn't just wake up and feel like death ResidentSleeper

[1:37:23] <HaroldDonchee> I like the dumb mouth movements
[1:37:23] <Melchior_the_Wise> Paige have you ever claimed to be a Southener? yes or no
[1:37:26] <%vVAstrAVv> its really fine

[1:37:57] <Melchior_the_Wise> because she's too hot for PAT
[1:38:00] <+QueequegTheater> Hormones get relocated from brain to loins
[1:38:01] <%MechArch> right and straight to gate
[1:38:05] <rekinom> She likes guidance from big strong man
[1:38:07] <KeiganOfAstora> FROM 10 MINUTES AGO
[1:38:08] <%patriotrenegade> @PeachSaliva go right and straight on until morning
[1:38:10] <cache_22> Shortcut through door to dungeon and right.
[1:38:11] <munitalprats> right and straight past bridge
[1:38:11] <HaroldDonchee> its happening
[1:38:11] <hakumaribo> @PeachSaliva i see it as you being able to truly be yourself when you fly solo.
[1:38:14] <%g0atmeal> if you explore a few times it'll stick
[1:38:26] <Wiiplayah43> I'm kind of like that, I become more independent when I don't have people around to help.
[1:38:27] <%king_wragles> sipsipSipsipblind_SG
[1:38:28] <%JoshManVGH> Proximity Bimboification?
[1:38:30] <+RD_NX> the vapors of a ~Man~ make the brain go beep beep
[1:38:34] <%MechArch> you did it
[1:38:37] <+QueequegTheater> @g0atmeal No it won't, this channel has a blind emote for a reason
[1:38:37] <munitalprats> the man musk
[1:38:44] <KeiganOfAstora> How do you forget where the shortcut you just learned is but remember how things like the controls work?
[1:38:49] <%SharkMissile> @JoshManVGH Is it possible to learn this power?
[1:38:50] <%nip_nips> maybe its just pats farts that ruin her brain
[1:38:50] <%g0atmeal> fair enough lol
[1:38:53] <+QueequegTheater> LUL
[1:38:58] <Melchior_the_Wise> those are some great screems
[1:38:59] <%MoonObscure> lol
[1:39:01] <Coystick> I don't remember them making that sound
[1:39:01] <KeiganOfAstora> Okay, focus on where the shortcut is
[1:39:01] <%patriotrenegade> yeah, he wasnt dead
[1:39:04] <%JenovasPuppet> This is fine

[1:39:13] <Melchior_the_Wise> his farts smell amazing right?
[1:39:14] <+RandyFistburgers> his elon
[1:39:14] <SpookyMooks> gamer musk
[1:39:15] <cache_22> All that Patosterone
[1:39:16] <%Estuko> I'm good at my games, but when I stream to my friends the crowd watching removes a chunk of my brain processing power
[1:39:17] <%ospreyworks> pheromones
[1:39:23] <Wiiplayah43> @KeiganOfAstora Because one is muscle memory from repeated exposure, the other is a single instance
[1:39:24] <rekinom> Pheromones
[1:39:24] <+QueequegTheater> @KeiganOfAstora That's an actual brain thing, it's why we don't have to think about how to use a controller
[1:39:24] <munitalprats> I want to see paige play chess
[1:39:24] <brisk_dacat> his stink keeps you focus
[1:39:28] <ryderbootz> paige
[1:39:29] <hakumaribo> his manly musk makes you go back to unga bunga
[1:39:30] <%ospreyworks> the pheromones make you weak

[1:39:52] <ToneBacas> the mouth flap is trembling but it's fine
[1:40:02] <%MechArch> ignore stinky ladies and fall through hole in next room
[1:40:02] <%JoshManVGH> @sharkmissile I've heard legends that the internet holds One Weird Trick, women HATE it, but this is assumed to be only legend.
[1:40:10] <Jetsfantasy> Yeah, I think they just pick up on your facial ticks and you don't see it until you do vtuber tracking
[1:40:21] <%peyodogo> it kinda makes sense that you'd do better on your own, i played ffxiv with a boyfriend nearby once and it was terrible

[1:40:39] <%nip_nips> ignore those stinky dungeon people
[1:40:46] <munitalprats> how do you remember how controls work
[1:40:47] <%Lion_kun> she keeps fighting them for no reason
[1:40:48] <+Taisuru> Use R2 when next to a wall
[1:40:48] <KeiganOfAstora> She didn't remember the shortcut, makes sense she wouldn't remember the hole. womp womp
[1:40:52] <TheAntiNihilist> With how Paige plays she seems like she'd love to play god of war, ratchet and clank, or castlevania
[1:40:52] <+QueequegTheater> @KeiganOfAstora Can't remember which video it was but Daryl Talks Games has a video on it
[1:40:53] <%Lion_kun> just fall down the hole

[1:42:04] <+QueequegTheater> I still think it's super weird that DS3 decided to reference a bunch of DS2 stuff through armor/weapons, but the NPC they brought back was fucking Creighton

[1:46:42] <$Sphincter_Spelunker> cool ring design, probably uncomfortable
[1:46:46] <tacostarvedbeast> hmph
[1:46:47] <%JenovasPuppet> Maybe you should go to the giant's feet...
[1:46:48] <%g0atmeal> past big rats
[1:46:49] <+Taisuru> You're good
[1:46:50] <%nip_nips> you go by the BIG rats
[1:46:53] <+Taisuru> Time to get cooked
[1:46:55] <%MechArch> right and straight to gate
[1:46:55] <%AncelDeLambert> deeper
[1:46:55] <%nip_nips> to the room full of fun
[1:46:56] <%patriotrenegade> the room with all the ladies
[1:46:57] <Melchior_the_Wise> the oh fuck room
[1:46:58] <%Lion_kun> no you have to get past the fuck roon
[1:47:00] <KeiganOfAstora> Down the cave tunnel you were going towards
[1:47:06] <Monkeyweed21> the big fuck room with all the ladies
[1:47:15] <tacostarvedbeast> i wonder how many people have wedding rings designed after souls series rings?
[1:47:19] <+QueequegTheater> Into the room labelled "Big Fuck"
[1:47:22] <%Lion_kun> the basilisk area was what is optional, the fuck room is mandatory
[1:47:22] <TurtlesAndTentacles> What about your souls?
[1:47:25] <%JoshManVGH> BTW is this the PC rebuild of Peaches account?
[1:47:27] <%patriotrenegade> @PeachSaliva Giants feet is later, you need to get through that big room full of the ladies
[1:47:32] <KeiganOfAstora> Into the tunnel with the rats, then into the spot where the extra rats come out of
[1:47:39] <%MoonObscure> lol
[1:47:40] <sydowoodo> of course you would remember that
[1:47:41] <%AncelDeLambert> @PeachSaliva well, you did see him play Cinders mod pretty recently
[1:47:48] <Aydarkzero> that ground had it coming
[1:47:49] <DrkJP520> fuck you, ground!
[1:47:50] <%MechArch> ignore ladies, first hole on right
[1:47:54] <munitalprats> if paige was in avatar she'd be an earthbender
[1:47:55] <%JenovasPuppet> @patriotrenegade Giant's feet has a pretty good shortcut though
[1:47:57] <Hozak> you need juuuuuust one more bit inot strength to kill them in one shot
[1:47:59] <$Sphincter_Spelunker> atpCap
[1:48:00] <+RD_NX> Paige these guys stagger if you roll into them
[1:48:01] <kadam79> I like that you can wiggle your ears Paige! That's so cute! :)
[1:48:05] <+QueequegTheater> I like how you had a hallway to funnel them into and immediately abandoned it for a worse position
[1:48:11] <Void_The_Dark> Maybe Paige. But maybe it's just skeleton. @PeachSaliva
[1:48:13] <%CubicPhantom> that just means he made the run enough to make an imprint on you
[1:48:13] <+Taisuru> Gotta go in the room with the ladies
[1:48:13] <%g0atmeal> do you have cat ring?
[1:48:14] <%Lion_kun> sure
[1:48:16] <munitalprats> Just go in lady room
[1:48:19] <+Taisuru> Lady room
[1:48:20] <munitalprats> you could do this too though
[1:48:21] <munitalprats> do what you will
[1:48:23] <%nip_nips> you can go down to giant if you want, but thats not progress
[1:48:26] <%AncelDeLambert> roll off
[1:48:26] <tacostarvedbeast> as Morpheus once said there is a difference in knowing the path and walking the path
[1:48:27] <cache_22> Giant hole > rat hole > lady room > feet
[1:48:28] <BigFingerRo> just drop .is cool
[1:48:32] <%MechArch> big room with many stinky lady
[1:48:34] <%g0atmeal> giant's feet will give a shortcut btw

[1:48:48] <%g0atmeal> giant room lets you talk to someone and shortcut
[1:48:54] <%JenovasPuppet> The question is: Can she kill ALL the ladies or one giant?
[1:48:56] <%Bt_Robot> THERE IS A SHORTCUT ON GIANT'S FLOOR
[1:48:58] <%patriotrenegade> @PeachSaliva Go left when you go in the room
[1:48:59] <%nip_nips> its a worse shortcut than the one shes using now
[1:49:05] <+RD_NX> left from here is shortcut
[1:49:06] <%g0atmeal> there's also a shortcut here tho so it's fine
[1:49:08] <Melchior_the_Wise> those rats are like a blue-steak
[1:49:12] <Melchior_the_Wise> very rare
[1:49:15] <$Sphincter_Spelunker> I barely remember DS3 cuz all the environments are the same color
[1:49:16] <%patriotrenegade> YES SHORTCUT
[1:49:17] <tacostarvedbeast> those rats are on rat steroids for sure
[1:49:28] <+QueequegTheater> DS2 > DS3

[1:50:07] <%Rumbutt> We're gonna have to tell her when she gets the thing, don't tell her to remember THAT there's no way
[1:50:07] <+QueequegTheater> Use the torso stone
[1:50:07] <freelancebabymaker> @Sphincter_Spelunker thats like the negative ive agreed with the most about ds3 wow

[2:02:08] <+Ne1son> Nobody wants the Quebec green card
[2:02:12] <%AncelDeLambert> I thought he said dog bites, and I assumed it was a brand of treat

[2:02:32] <%AncelDeLambert> hey Fetched, how went the stream?
[2:02:42] <pretendofriendo> French Canada is BEST CANADA
[2:02:44] <+DigiGator> Pat just knew Day 1 tiffosNeroSmug
[2:03:02] <Wiiplayah43> Everything Pat & Woolie say about Quebec make it sound AWFUL
[2:03:04] <%MoonObscure> be citizn yes
[2:03:07] <+Pugs_wellington> Pugs_wellington subscribed with Prime. 
[2:03:09] <%Estuko> If your SO doesn't come in to loudly announce to everyone how nice your butt is then are you really together
[2:03:14] <%ThomasOfTroy> Do you get Canadian health insurance with permanent residency or do you need citizenship?
[2:03:17] <fluffy_sauce> Service Guarantees Citizenship!
[2:03:22] <+polothegreatest> but u lose the F R E E D O M psaCaw
[2:03:24] <%JoshManVGH> Is marriage a gateway to permanent residence, or is that still a million pages of paperwork battle?
[2:03:43] <thelonechris> Aren't Quebec streets in a perpetual state of disrepair or something?
[2:03:46] <Profmcstevie> Pros and cons, the cons are frustrating
[2:04:01] <%3d_pbandj> Did you already get the ringed sword to stab into pats face for the wedding? That is how weddings go
[2:04:01] <pretendofriendo> it's a gateway to Pat's Sweet bussy
[2:04:17] <$Sphincter_Spelunker> atpCarl @pretendofriendo
[2:04:20] <%JoshManVGH> Totally fair!
[2:04:35] <dd44dostivei> does the frenchness of quebec make it difficult, or the xeno-weirdness?
[2:04:46] <%waltzqueen> how else am i supposed to get rid of this sword?
[2:04:48] <Profmcstevie> a drawing of a hand turkey wielding a sword
[2:04:53] <+Gondab> Whenever I play Survivor I play Ash with his tropical puppet hand outfit.
[2:04:54] <+Ynkubus_> get a larp sword
[2:04:58] <freelancebabymaker> @peachsaliva open that po box so i can buy you transformers comic
[2:05:13] <$rdark_ksu> When Pat proposed all that was on your mind was "wait how'd he get even shorter?"
[2:05:16] <TurtlesAndTentacles> was it Yo Video games or Best Friends that got sent tons of dicks when they got a po box?
[2:05:19] <JunkyardCrow> 👈 yank
[2:05:29] <+realm_forge> @peachsaliva I make props so I can totally make that sword happen
[2:05:31] <%3d_pbandj> @TurtlesAndTentacles both
[2:05:35] <%ThomasOfTroy> But Paige, you're an anime! I thought Quebecois LOVED animes?
[2:05:38] <Srthunda> you arent kidding
[2:05:42] <pretendofriendo> @sphincter_spelunker GlitchNRG
[2:05:54] <%rumtumtugnutz> Most of Quebec is hill country.
[2:05:57] <TurtlesAndTentacles> @3d_pbandj We should all send Paige boobs
[2:05:59] <%Lion_kun> You should tell them what they speak isn't actually French
[2:05:59] <devanmuse> @TurtlesAndTentacles I know the Best Friends got at least two dicks in the mail. Not sure about Yo Videogames, though
[2:06:00] <%rumtumtugnutz> They're french hillbillies
[2:06:02] <%JoshManVGH> I guess I kinda hoped beuracruacy would make it easier for couples to stay together. But I forgot beuracracy.
[2:06:10] <TurtlesAndTentacles> nah fuck Quebec
[2:06:10] <a_mad_dragon_> quebecois consider the english accent to be a personal affront
[2:06:11] <+Ne1son> Nah shit on 'em that what they get
[2:06:18] <%ThomasOfTroy> @TurtlesAndTentacles They got an entire bad of mini dragon dildos
[2:06:20] <+Ne1son> for being F R E N C H
[2:06:24] <$Sphincter_Spelunker> a ton of pallets

[2:07:14] <$Sphincter_Spelunker> which area is above Detroit
[2:07:29] <+YabbaTroll> Why live in a city?
[2:07:31] <cyclone722> it feels like quebec really just want to be it's own country so bad
[2:07:34] <whittacre> don't move to toronto, move to something like windsor or london
[2:07:43] <+polothegreatest> internet
[2:08:02] <Coystick> Lower the cost, higher the smell

[2:08:04] <$Sphincter_Spelunker> french don't know the value of money Kappa
[2:08:10] <+YabbaTroll> you can get decentish internet out of a city
[2:08:15] <pretendofriendo> @yabbatroll decent internet
[2:08:16] <Ravioli_Ronin> But if you lived in Toronto, drake would be watching over your city as a silent sentinel from that one tower
[2:08:19] <TurtlesAndTentacles> France is pretty racist too
[2:08:20] <a_mad_dragon_> french people driving down property values Kappa
[2:08:37] <%ThomasOfTroy> Everywhere is pretty racist in their own specific ways

[2:12:43] <%Estuko> Dang I feel bad, I've had players trapped on the hooks and I opened the gate because I'm the last survivor.
[2:12:52] <+scizor285> I'm off work so I'm a bit tired.
[2:12:54] <Zeif00> Sometimes opening the gate creates too much pressure for survivors with the end game collapse
[2:12:58] <%AncelDeLambert> I am big and strong
[2:13:02] <+scizor285> hospital work can get busy.

[2:15:46] <boomstickery> is that the ara ara?

[2:19:42] <+RealThiele> i mean pats tradeoff is mold infection
[2:19:44] <+scizor285> I would say the only killer I don't like is doctor
[2:19:44] <@MistyMntns> jfc that Doctor
[2:19:47] <+scizor285> so annoying.
[2:19:48] <Jetsfantasy> monkaS
[2:19:49] <%AncelDeLambert> noice
[2:19:53] <ohno778> stealth
[2:20:02] <%AncelDeLambert> Stealth 100
[2:20:02] <%Estuko> I do NOT like the Doctor, the aoe attacks annoy me greatly
[2:20:04] <%JoshManVGH> @fairore Pull that out next private time. Guaranteed to get a result!
[2:20:06] <%waltzqueen> @scizor285 does that include prayer beads spirit
[2:20:11] <boomstickery> yes, doctors are right
[2:20:18] <+scizor285> prayer beads?
[2:20:27] <%AncelDeLambert> yoooooo get that Great, gurl
[2:20:30] <ranarath> Doctor is the only killer I’m good with. He’s my friend.
[2:20:36] <+scizor285> I'm a bit casual to the game so I don't know that is.
[2:20:40] <+Gondab> Distressing is good on Doctor because it increases his static blast
[2:20:41] <@MistyMntns> Doctor is one of my most hated people to go against
[2:20:58] <%ThomasOfTroy> Good lord, ***
[2:21:00] <%waltzqueen> The phasing sound emission is heard by all Survivors outside of The Spirit's Terror Radius.
[2:21:02] <%AncelDeLambert> iunno
[2:21:07] <+scizor285> I've played enough to max out bill.
[2:21:14] <+scizor285> he's fun to play for me.
[2:21:15] <@MistyMntns> isnt it a key addon?
[2:21:15] <+Taisuru> RUB THAT GENS BUTT
[2:21:24] <%nip_nips> look at those pistons go
[2:21:28] <%AncelDeLambert> the gen is a sexy lady, you must rub it
[2:21:33] <%AncelDeLambert> WOOOO GREAT!
[2:22:05] <ranarath> Oh, what perks is Paige running?
[2:22:08] <+Taisuru> Zippity Zappity come get your slappity
[2:22:11] <+scizor285> I remember when I first started playing, I was so bad at missing the huntress axes
[2:22:17] <%AncelDeLambert> "Dr Frankenfurter, Rocky has escaped." "Cooooomiiiiing"
[2:22:20] <%waltzqueen> generally speaking prayer beads spirits also have the mother daughter bracelet and are considered so OP that it's mean
[2:22:23] <scrumbotime> If I ever met myself I think I'd say Howdy Do too
[2:22:42] <+scizor285> oh no
[2:23:04] <%AncelDeLambert> "Your move, doctor man"
[2:23:11] <eyeobject> now they kiss
[2:23:12] <@MistyMntns> Gotta Loop that Killer man
[2:23:20] <+scizor285> how do you get good at loops?
[2:23:25] <Zeif00> Excited for the mid-chapter update this week, going to see so many Quintins and Lauries
[2:23:30] <%AncelDeLambert> watch videos
[2:23:36] <%nip_nips> you must eat your froot loops
[2:23:38] <+Taisuru> THE LOOPS BROTHER
[2:23:39] <%AncelDeLambert> you watch people who know how to loop tell you how
[2:23:40] <@SoFarFetched> definitely takes al ot of practice
[2:23:41] <thelonechris> Just don't die 4Head
[2:23:49] <+Gondab> It's about mind games.
[2:23:52] <%Estuko> "Not Otzdarva" on YT
[2:23:54] <@MistyMntns> So when you are mashing to wiggle your vtube character's mouth chitters.
[2:23:58] <+scizor285> ah okay. I'll have to watch some stuff.
[2:24:08] <%Estuko> He also has a massive guide on his twitch channel as well for killers/perks/survivors
[2:24:10] <%ClericOfSparda> ScottJund has interesting Killer tips
[2:24:13] <President_Pariah> playing DBD as a killer is a lot like playing Tag where you're it and everyone else takes turns stomping your dick
[2:24:28] <%waltzqueen> Otzdarva and his second channel Otzdarva
[2:24:36] <@MelBrooksKA> Paige, I never know what you're saying
[2:24:38] <%waltzqueen> Not Otz*
[2:24:46] <%Estuko> Otzdarva has funny meme videos on YT, and Not Otzdarva are stream videos and tips/guides
[2:24:53] <+scizor285> thanks for being so kind and answering my questions, Paige.
[2:25:10] <boomstickery> the otehrs best be doing gens
[2:25:15] <+scizor285> I promise to not spam questions.
[2:25:28] <Zeif00> Kate and Meg have keys btw
[2:25:32] <+scizor285> hope everyone else is doing well today!
[2:25:40] <%Estuko> @boomstickery not me getting 4 gens done alone only to be the only survivor killed NotLikeThis
[2:25:40] <@MistyMntns> GGWP
[2:25:42] <%nip_nips> this is going swimmingly
[2:26:14] <freelancebabymaker> i wonder what like a good low to the floor version of the hooks would work the best in this game to help make shorter killers more agreeable
[2:26:26] <boomstickery> hs sucha dickbutt
[2:26:27] <%Estuko> Doctor makes me salt because of his ability lool
[2:26:29] <Zeif00> Just Doctor things
[2:26:36] <+scizor285> yah doctor is so tilting.
[2:26:50] <@SoFarFetched> Doctor does a LOT of bloodpoints stuff
[2:26:55] <@SoFarFetched> especially with the shock
[2:27:10] <Srthunda> I liked doctor before he was buffed
[2:27:10] <freelancebabymaker> cuz people really want like chucky and leprechaun and stuff and they just really dont seem to gel with the game as it currently is
[2:27:17] <+scizor285> spirit? I haven't played her much.
[2:27:27] <@MistyMntns> I would rather go against The Spirit than the doctor
[2:27:35] <+scizor285> I use to not like demigorgon
[2:27:50] <Zeif00> Kate probably made a beeline for hatch with key
[2:27:56] <freelancebabymaker> like what could you just put cranks on all the hooks so shorter characters could have an easier time using them?
[2:27:56] <BigFingerRo> Hey, is it a common ocurrance to have killers RQ?
[2:27:57] <+Gondab> Doctor is great with Distressing, then you can pick out the one cloudette crouching in the corner to harass
[2:28:13] <%Estuko> I'd go against any other killer that isn't doctor lol
[2:28:25] <+scizor285> is that new killer still good? the one where you can send out the little guy?
[2:28:38] <$TheNewZealandStory> @scizor285 no, but they're sure annoying to play against
[2:28:43] <+scizor285> hated playing against it when it first came out.
[2:28:43] <BackflipCharm> Where's the K Pop man?
[2:28:55] <%Estuko> I'd lose fast, I'll leave a GG Well played. But I'll do it with a frown irl lol
[2:29:00] <+scizor285> cuz I couldn't figure out how to kick the little guy.
[2:29:16] <+scizor285> kpop man looks so cool.
[2:29:17] <Elky3> I like how her VTuber model is as close as it can get to her
[2:29:27] <@MistyMntns> Man now I want to play DBD rn
[2:29:29] <%Estuko> mhm her model is super great
[2:29:31] <HotSauceFiend> ha, I'm in the middle of playing DBD killer rn, god luck
[2:29:34] <+scizor285> didn't really get the hate for kpop man.
[2:29:52] <+Gondab> Vulpix + Paige = Vtuber
[2:30:06] <%king_wragles> @Elky3 Even the fox ears!
[2:30:29] <+bigcomfyman> What's that smeeeeell..
[2:30:36] <@PatStaresAt> TAKE IT OFF SHOW US UR BEWBS
[2:30:36] <%ThomasOfTroy> Are you confirming that you're a furry?
[2:30:39] <+scizor285> I like your vtuber cuz it's comes off as warm and comforting.
[2:30:51] <BackflipCharm> Honestly I didn't like the style of this model at first, but it's really grown on me. Glad it makes it easier for you to stream.
[2:30:52] <%kyh9> I just don't think he's scare
[2:30:58] <+Gondab> Sandbag
[2:30:58] <scrumbotime> I like the pearl necklace, makes you look like a Real Classy Broad
[2:31:04] <mr_saturday93> Pat says show us your bewbs
[2:31:10] <Huntercd> Sexual aggressive animal is a phrase I never thought I would say
[2:31:11] <churropoppa> so did Eli draw your character?
[2:31:13] <+DrHentaiPhD> very good comf spice and wolf vibes
[2:31:15] <scrumbotime> Pat, she said she will do a sexy voice for 10k subs
[2:31:24] <%kyh9> Like, K-pop man doesn't represent a classic horror archetype nor is he particularly scary in his own right
[2:31:31] <TurtlesAndTentacles> PEARL NECKLACE! SHE WANT A PEARL NECKLACE
[2:31:34] <+scizor285> I've been getting into accessories for summer so pearl necklaces seem cool in my book.
[2:31:34] <%nip_nips> @PatStaresAt SHOW YOURS
[2:31:37] <+Nymphonomicon> BEH
[2:31:38] <+BiggusWingless> Yeah this vtuber model feels like such a perfect fit. I'm so glad that it's given you more freedom and confidence to do your shit you do so well!
[2:31:41] <+CaptainPyron> Trickster's fun to show a different type of slasher. Nothing like just the unhinged psycho.
[2:31:49] <+CaptainPyron> Instead of buff scary monster.
[2:31:50] <Zeif00> His story is interesting
[2:32:00] <$TheNewZealandStory> i like the trickster aesthetically, but he's not very well designed or fun to play against
[2:32:03] <%king_wragles> Dude trying to kill you with literally 1000 cuts isn't scary, noted
[2:32:05] <+scizor285> kpop man comes off as modern horror
[2:32:09] <+scizor285> for me.
[2:32:10] <+EroHoney> he's definitely the evil hot trope from slasher. I really like his attitude
[2:32:11] <BackflipCharm> From the little bit I know Kpop man is kind of Joker like?
[2:32:11] <%kyh9> We already have Legion
[2:32:11] <+Nymphonomicon> Does Trickster have a perk called Royal Guard or Swordmaster?
[2:32:12] <%JoshManVGH> Serial Killer seems like an archetype.
[2:32:16] <nivlac_555> nothing's more horrifying than show business
[2:32:22] <@SoFarFetched> @Nymphonomicon nope
[2:32:23] <Elky3> K-Pop man shows the dark side of K-Pop a lot of us westerners don't know of
[2:32:25] <Zeif00> Going to be nothing but Tricksters on Tuesday
[2:32:26] <%kyh9> Trickster covers a lot of the same theme and grounding as Legion
[2:32:29] <%kyh9> AT least for me
[2:32:32] <%JoshManVGH> Maybe K-Drama stuff?
[2:32:32] <+DrHentaiPhD> whom is kpop man?
[2:32:35] <freelancebabymaker> i kinda want more characters that are just like ripoffs of classic slashers like the first three killers were
[2:32:40] <bevyrage> korea is known for making solid zombie films, even if it's mostly train to busan
[2:32:41] <%kyh9> @JoshManVGH Maybe, maybe
[2:32:49] <+Gondab> Trickster ability is amazing, everything else though...
[2:32:52] <$TheNewZealandStory> not looking forward to the trickster buff
[2:33:01] <@MistyMntns> LIke a year ago?
[2:33:01] <+Nymphonomicon> Why does Kate look like an Until Dawn character?
[2:33:02] <ranarath> Paprika is such a good movie.
[2:33:04] <Elky3> 4-5 months ago
[2:33:06] <%kyh9> For everyone in chat, what are some k-horrors or k-dramas that have villains or monsters like the Trickster?
[2:33:07] <Frogwash> If they made the k-pop man a stalker, and the survivor an idol, I feel like it would fit better into the horror theme
[2:33:09] <freelancebabymaker> @bevyrage man train to busan fucks
[2:33:10] <Zeif00> Big buff, takes 6 knives instead of 8 to damage people but with faster decay
[2:33:14] <+Gondab> double bloodpoints the 29th
[2:33:14] <%Estuko> I like Trickster, he's cheered on and has a massive fan base unlike other serial killers who are hunted down by police or hidden from the public.
[2:33:31] <Huntercd> Kpop? Really so a sexy Korean man is now a killer?
[2:33:52] <TurtlesAndTentacles> Friday the 13th is coming up soon
[2:33:56] <%Estuko> double? I'd better save my sacrifical cake for that then
[2:33:57] <freelancebabymaker> idk i like the idea of the trickster on paper but something about him just doesnt do it for me
[2:34:01] <@MistyMntns> You can show the killer in the character select screen
[2:34:01] <whittacre> @huntercd they have a manager as a villain and a star as a surviver
[2:34:03] <%BiggusWingless> "You can be sexy and murder" -- PeachSaliva
[2:34:03] <+scizor285> when's Patrick Bateman for DBD?
[2:34:04] <+Gondab> Crown collection unlocked a bloodhunt
[2:34:05] <@MistyMntns> jfc Paige
[2:34:05] <@Jekado> Fuck fighting or Fight fucking?
[2:34:07] <scrumbotime> she killed that guy in football, remember?
[2:34:08] <%JoshManVGH> Hot Evil is a thing!
[2:34:08] <+Nymphonomicon> She looks like a cross between Sam and Jess to me.
[2:34:08] <%kyh9> Like, I've watched a good number of korean movies and while they have villains like the Trickster, none of the horror ones do
[2:34:09] <Zeif00> Bloodhunt because we got so many crowns, save ur cakes
[2:34:10] <Piemono> Thought Paige was gonna say you can be sexy and Korean
[2:34:15] <@Jekado> Look at American Psycho
[2:34:16] <%Estuko> Sexy and dangerous, look at Pyramid Head
[2:34:20] <$TheNewZealandStory> i think its very believable that the kpop industry could drive someone to murder
[2:34:24] <eco419> Poot Pat D:
[2:34:29] <@SoFarFetched> oh yeah bloodhunt is on the 29th I believe
[2:34:32] <@SoFarFetched> geefThink
[2:34:41] <+scizor285> would love to see an American psycho type killer for DBD.
[2:34:50] <%peyodogo> oh shit thats a good reminder to check the ol adhd diary
[2:34:51] <%kyh9> Like,Lee Byung Hun plays a lot of characters like the Trickster but he never plays a Horror slasher in them, just a general villain
[2:34:54] <@SoFarFetched> We should play on those days paige,cause I also have a lot of cakes
[2:35:03] <+Gondab> 29 - 2
[2:35:07] <%AncelDeLambert> how would you make a nailgun killer work
[2:35:14] <%JoshManVGH> Are there any horror killers that play with time?
[2:35:14] <NeroInfinite> I'd love to see the byebye man in the game if only for a giggle
[2:35:22] <%AncelDeLambert> I know THAT feeling
[2:35:27] <nivlac_555> equalizer
[2:35:30] <%kyh9> I just really want Candyman
[2:35:31] <@MistyMntns> I want the Candyman in DBD
[2:35:32] <%kyh9> Or Alien
[2:35:32] <+scizor285> candy man?
[2:35:33] <freelancebabymaker> they need that power drill massacre guy in this
[2:35:33] <%VexicBayn> the babadook
[2:35:38] <+DrHentaiPhD> POWER DRILL MASSACRE for DbD
[2:35:40] <+scizor285> that would be cool.
[2:35:41] <scrumbotime> They should put in Robocop
[2:35:41] <NeroInfinite> yeah Candyman
[2:35:44] <HaroldDonchee> is there a swamp thing yet?
[2:35:44] <%VexicBayn> @freelancebabymaker exquisite fucking taste
[2:35:44] <TurtlesAndTentacles> DONT SAY HIS NAME AGAIN
[2:35:45] <%nip_nips> keep saying candyman
[2:35:46] <+Basker17> Whats the Candy-mans gimmick?
[2:35:47] <+JackalKing> Candyman would be a great one
[2:35:48] <+LionKagura> I don get candyman at all never thought he was scary just stupid
[2:35:50] <%Gouf_Troop> Yeah Tony Todd
[2:35:51] <TurtlesAndTentacles> GOD DAMMIT PAIGE
[2:35:52] <%Estuko> Candy Man would be awesome, his terrifying presence should be accompanied by bees flying near your screen
[2:35:52] <Srthunda> no idea who the candyman is
[2:35:53] <$hrbeck_> YOU SAID IT 3 TIMES
[2:35:54] <%JoshManVGH> Just keeps popping out of mirrors?
[2:35:55] <+scizor285> imagine candyman is where they add mirrors all over the map?
[2:35:56] <%nip_nips> @Basker17 say his name 5 times and he appears
[2:35:57] <%AncelDeLambert> I hear Candyman and all I can think of is that dodgeball game
[2:35:57] <+Ches_Neckbeard> get Slenderman in DBD cowards
[2:35:59] <+Gondab> Hag
[2:35:59] <$TheNewZealandStory> @Srthunda candyman
[2:36:00] <%Estuko> Hag is kinda a swamp lady?
[2:36:01] <+tweedler92> It totally should be
[2:36:06] <+Nymphonomicon> I'm pretty sure Tony Todd has better shit to do.
[2:36:07] <@MistyMntns> Ive been neck deep in creepypastas now I also want Slender in DBD
[2:36:08] <%SveriSageAdvice> candyman was just a weird ass horror villain, i dont get him at all
[2:36:09] <%AncelDeLambert> Creature From the Black Lagoon would be cool
[2:36:09] <+Gondab> I love playing Hag
[2:36:10] <liliiliiiliiiiliiiiil> what is happening
[2:36:10] <freelancebabymaker> this game is truly like a dartboard for horror characters
[2:36:11] <CandyCoatedConfection> they just did a licensed killer. they're going to go original next. that's the usual order right?
[2:36:13] <UPTONOGOOD18> when did @PeachSaliva get a vtuber avatar
[2:36:16] <ranarath> @basker17 BEES!
[2:36:18] <+LionKagura> @Srthunda Just google it then lol
[2:36:19] <devanmuse> You think Slenderman might get in DbD? Or is he a dead fad now?
[2:36:21] <%AncelDeLambert> ZZAT!
[2:36:26] <liliiliiiliiiiliiiiil> where is paige
[2:36:26] <%JoshManVGH> Wait have they not done classic monsters at all?
[2:36:31] <$TheNewZealandStory> @SveriSageAdvice he's kind of a bunch of random shit thrown together
[2:36:37] <NeroInfinite> SLenderman's a bit of a dead fad by now
[2:36:38] <+scizor285> have you seen how much people thirst trap for scream and Jason?
[2:36:39] <@SoFarFetched> the Vtuber ATE paige
[2:36:40] <%kyh9> Candyman mains crying as the four survivors keep forcefully summoning him through different mirrors across the map
[2:36:41] <@SoFarFetched> geefGasp
[2:36:42] <+06Marc90> PogChamp
[2:36:44] <+Gondab> putting random traps around as Hag is the absolute best
[2:36:44] <freelancebabymaker> @devanmuse we must all mourn slenderman for his horrible pop culture death
[2:36:44] <%Estuko> @devanmuse idk, it'd be weird with his model and a dead fad doesn't help.
[2:36:45] <+CaptainPyron> Paige for next Killer.
[2:36:48] <+scizor285> I've seen so many tiktoks and Tumblr posts.
[2:36:49] <+realm_forge> What about the mirror from Oculus?
[2:36:52] <+D00msDayDan> why does that creature speak with paige's voice
[2:36:54] <liliiliiiliiiiliiiiil> this is weird
[2:36:57] <ohno778> She's an anime
[2:36:57] <+Nymphonomicon> Aggressively animated Peach.
[2:37:04] <scrumbotime> Paige killer has to be kept away from the ham
[2:37:04] <@MistyMntns> Special attack is Mustard
[2:37:09] <+hazmatt20xx> i never considered what earrings would look like on animal ears...
[2:37:11] <devanmuse> @freelancebabymaker Was the movie the final nail in his coffin?
[2:37:12] <$hrbeck_> the doctors finally healed her
[2:37:15] <%Estuko> Paige is an anime now, she's just as super foxy but anime now
[2:37:15] <$TheNewZealandStory> in the future most people will be vtubers
[2:37:16] <+scizor285> cat ears are cool.
[2:37:19] <%MechArch> digital makeup
[2:37:19] <augusta_wind> wow your makeup looks so smooth what primer do you use
[2:37:20] <+RenoDeGeneric> Paige with her little egg gremlin hunting down survivors
[2:37:22] <@MistyMntns> Another great map
[2:37:25] <Coystick> Unlocking a BIG fetish
[2:37:25] <+Basker17> The lipsync looks amazing
[2:37:32] <@SoFarFetched> sounds like you got a hillbily
[2:37:39] <freelancebabymaker> @devanmuse the movie along with those girls who tried to kill their friend or whatever
[2:37:42] <@SoFarFetched> LUL
[2:37:42] <%JoshManVGH> Make up is looking a little
[2:37:44] <Spudnacious_Dynasty> I keep the settings window open because Vtubers make me physically uncomfortable to watch Keep up the good work.
[2:37:44] <@MistyMntns> GGWP
[2:37:45] <MrDrStein> what made you decide to switch to live2d?
[2:37:48] <@SoFarFetched> WHATS GOTTEN BILLY SO SPOOKED
[2:37:52] <Zeif00> Omg Billy, I haven't faced one in forever
[2:37:53] <+scizor285> oh God those pigs.
[2:37:58] <mr_saturday93> shit IN your tits!?
[2:38:06] <NeroInfinite> 20 wild hogs from billy
[2:38:07] <%Estuko> @freelancebabymaker something hornets?
[2:38:21] <devanmuse> @freelancebabymaker Oh yeah, almost forgot about that. Yeeeeah I can see why people wouldn't want to associate with it after that
[2:38:29] <+scizor285> so kinda like the iron mouse situation?
[2:38:29] <freelancebabymaker> @estuko no there was some like shitty slenderman movie in like 2018
[2:38:41] <@SoFarFetched> Yeah its like when she would go purple on stream sometimes
[2:38:42] <%Estuko> oh was there really? I thought you meant the Marble Hornets videos lol
[2:38:45] <@MistyMntns> @freelancebabymaker That is the only movie that I walked out of and got a refund for
[2:38:47] <%JoshManVGH> Makeup is looking a little... flat! (Get it, cause 2D)
[2:38:58] <Coystick> You're a lot more relaxed with the avatar, it's good
[2:39:14] <$KnivesEve> oh wow your streaming alot more often now peach. cool =D
[2:39:22] <+Jonny_Worldbeater> Paige has merely become the horny furry big-titty broken vocaloid she was always destined to be
[2:39:23] <@MistyMntns> That guy is in the Basement
[2:39:23] <+scizor285> what are your thoughts on the resi stuff for this game. I already heard pats schpeel
[2:39:23] <devanmuse> @freelancebabymaker Now that I'm reminded it exists, I kinda want to do a hatewatch of it soon
[2:39:26] <Zeif00> This new form is fun
[2:39:28] <%peyodogo> yeah honestly whatever's comfiest is best imo, better vibes
[2:39:36] <%AncelDeLambert> we get it, you don't want to come on camera looking like Violet from Willy Wonka
[2:39:46] <+Nymphonomicon> If only you randomly broken out into a non-English speech, you'd be the perfect analogue to Mousey...
[2:39:48] <%JoshManVGH> And really, how many time can we look at Elmo's bag?
[2:39:51] <President_Pariah> do you feel less of the 'weight of eyes' w/ the avatar? or pretty much the same?
[2:39:52] <+Emperor_Z> Lupus = wolf = grow almost-wolf ears. Factual lupus symptoms
[2:39:53] <%Estuko> I like it, it feels like a growth and it makes me happy to come hang out with everyone :) personally I'm crazy anxious whenever I'd play infront of others
[2:39:58] <eyeobject> I'm happy that we get more streams now
[2:39:58] <freelancebabymaker> i still think there is some like niche spot in the horror community for slenderman to make some form of a comeback and dbd could maybe be it
[2:40:03] <BigFingerRo> Hey guys, I stepped away for a sec, have people sucked every one of paige's nuts yet?
[2:40:27] <+Gondab> Paige not paying attention.
[2:40:39] <%king_wragles> We've gotten "shit in my tits" but nothing about nuts yet
[2:40:40] <$NitronStreams> but now you can pick your nose and no one would ever know
[2:40:43] <pretendofriendo> @bigfingerro we try but shes not making it easy
[2:40:49] <%Estuko> Paige talking and doing this is insane, the timing requires my absolute full attention to pull off
[2:40:49] <+Nymphonomicon> I'm da hostess with the mostest.
[2:40:52] <Jetsfantasy> No balls in the ass yet
[2:41:05] <freelancebabymaker> i was big on creepypasta back in like middle school and i just really wanna see a few of those characters make some form of comeback
[2:41:05] <+Gondab> Mechanical animal killer
[2:41:06] <+Emperor_Z> Slenderman running around actually doing things would be weird
[2:41:07] <sydowoodo> who would be survivor for slenderman???
[2:41:10] <%Gouf_Troop> even with the actual attempted murder
[2:41:12] <$TheNewZealandStory> i would like to see some classic horror movie monsters in dbd
[2:41:22] <@MistyMntns> Dodged
[2:41:23] <+scizor285> sick loops!
[2:41:24] <sydowoodo> juke em
[2:41:26] <ranarath> Nice juke!
[2:41:29] <%AncelDeLambert> Paige finally found a guy she can loop
[2:41:29] <%JoshManVGH> That was a good juke!
[2:41:31] <JobbedBone> maybe candyman
[2:41:34] <scrumbotime> THERE are the balls on stream
[2:41:40] <%Estuko> I like Peach with my ninjas
[2:41:40] <fictionalknight> I got an ad right when paige said I do think slender man has a big PogChamp
[2:41:40] <+JackalKing> I don't think slenderman stands a chance after the whole "teenagers trying to kill their friend" thing. Plus, his time in the spotlight is long past.
[2:41:42] <President_Pariah> i'm slightly bummed you can't buy any licensed characters w/ the in-game currency, only OG ones
[2:41:46] <@SoFarFetched> way paige sandbagging LUL
[2:41:54] <%ThomasOfTroy> Slender man might get pushback though because of that teen murder attempt a few years back
[2:41:55] <NeroInfinite> Slender would be sorta easier to implement , since he can use existing killer's mechanics.
[2:41:58] <%nip_nips> hes comin for that booty
[2:42:02] <Jetsfantasy> Sunken cost fallacy
[2:42:04] <@Jekado> why do you lead them towards your allies?
[2:42:04] <freelancebabymaker> theres so many killers that could be in this game and i cant even nail down a single one that i wanna see
[2:42:06] <%JoshManVGH> He was very upset about what you did
[2:42:07] <%AncelDeLambert> oh my god she's doing it
[2:42:09] <%Estuko> You know what I'd LOVE, a space alien
[2:42:09] <JobbedBone> HAHAHA HOHOHO
[2:42:10] <@SoFarFetched> LUL
[2:42:12] <sydowoodo> dont get cocky
[2:42:12] <scrumbotime> Paige is singing the song of Pat's people
[2:42:14] <+scizor285> I love all the fun musical stuff you know.
[2:42:19] <%Estuko> I want a Spooky space alien as the next killer
[2:42:22] <cs0402196> Gotta leave paige, the heavy heartbeating in my ears is giving me a headache. :(
[2:42:22] <CalderGaming> he SURE CAN
[2:42:23] <blue6sub6remnant6> Look it at this way Paige, you're wasting so much of the killer's time by making him chase you for actual minutes.
[2:42:26] <+scizor285> I still laugh whenever you and pat do the bikey man
[2:42:30] <brisk_dacat> Look at you triggering the killer
[2:42:33] <Jetsfantasy> You were reading him like a book
[2:42:33] <%Estuko> Can we just get Crypto from Destroy All Humans as the next killer?
[2:42:35] <freelancebabymaker> i want like scooby doo dlc with a sheet ghost killer really badly tho
[2:42:38] <@SoFarFetched> I made a musical reference earlier in my stream geefPlz wasn't expecting the King and I
[2:42:50] <ranarath> I love the cute avatar randomly spouting “suck my balls!”
[2:42:52] <@MistyMntns> @Estuko There is the Killer Klowns from outer space
[2:43:05] <+Basker17> Does anyone even own the rights to slender man?
[2:43:07] <+scizor285> yo Scooby doo would be a cool idea
[2:43:07] <President_Pariah> you should play Huntress and sing showtunes as you chase survivors
[2:43:08] <@Jekado> Sandbagging the real killer is always the person next to you
[2:43:09] <zenith0111> The models super cute AYAYA
[2:43:11] <pretendofriendo> @sofarfetched looks like we are GETTING TO KNOOOWWWW YOUUUUU
[2:43:13] <%JoshManVGH> All that trouble to get you killed
[2:43:16] <%AncelDeLambert> well in that case, Mars Attacks martians
[2:43:17] <@Jekado> DbD things
[2:43:20] <%Estuko> we already got clown, I want like little green man that curses at you lol
[2:43:23] <+Nymphonomicon> Only one clown? We need the whole circus.
[2:43:25] <%AncelDeLambert> ACK ACK ACK ACK
[2:43:28] <ursusbearrammage> i want slimer from ghostbusters so bad hed look terrible
[2:43:28] <@SoFarFetched> @pretendofriendo GETTING TO LIIIIIKKKE YOU,GETTING TO HOPE YOU LIKE MEEEE
[2:43:29] <%JoshManVGH> How about The Leprechun?
[2:43:30] <freelancebabymaker> @Basker17 i mean maybe the guy that like actually created him?
[2:43:33] <scrumbotime> The great gazoo
[2:43:38] <+Emperor_Z> What about Sadako/Samara?
[2:43:45] <+scizor285> I love when you and pat do the bikey man song.
[2:43:48] <@Jekado> Xenomorph is pretty fast isn't it?
[2:43:51] <+Gondab> I still with MR.X. got in
[2:43:57] <+Gondab> wish
[2:43:57] <%Estuko> I mentioned about Chucky with his human girlfriend carrying him and flailing him around to attack survivors lol
[2:43:58] <MintyRoots> Kinda been wanting a SCP killer tbh
[2:44:02] <%king_wragles> but u ded
[2:44:02] <@Jekado> allow the xeno of fast vault?
[2:44:06] <@SoFarFetched> do you want me to carry your booty to victory geefBush
[2:44:09] <%JoshManVGH> @emperor_z I think they have a "legally distinct" version
[2:44:10] <Coystick> Not just the Xenomorph, specifically it should be either the Big Chap or the Sevastapol Xeno
[2:44:13] <freelancebabymaker> @estuko thats a pretty good idea
[2:44:14] <%AncelDeLambert> Xenomorph would be really cool, because you could switch out hooks for eggs
[2:44:16] <%ThomasOfTroy> Slendman still seems too sensitive imo
[2:44:18] <pretendofriendo> @sofarfetched Getting to know you Putting it my way But nicely You are precisely My cup of tea
[2:44:22] <TurtlesAndTentacles> Yeah but make her hot
[2:44:24] <PhiloRobo> I feel like Slenderman couldn't be so tall as to not fit into a building and that suck.
[2:44:36] <devanmuse> Everybody's saying Xenomorph, but what about The Predator?
[2:44:42] <+scizor285> Scooby doo would be cool as survivors.
[2:44:42] <@SoFarFetched> @pretendofriendo well now Im gonna probably watch a couple musical clips later geefLul
[2:44:46] <freelancebabymaker> i feel like the xenomorph might be a little too close to the demogorgon?
[2:44:57] <%AncelDeLambert> Predator is action
[2:44:57] <+Gondab> Guns are hard to balance in this game
[2:45:02] <NeroInfinite> Pred's not really a horror guy.
[2:45:04] <%Estuko> A xenomorph skin for the Demogorgon would be kind of neat
[2:45:09] <Coystick> Jeepers Creepers man would be great if the franchise wasn't so tainted
[2:45:10] <+Gondab> Deathslinger is an exception
[2:45:11] <%3d_pbandj> Slender Man would actually be really good pick
[2:45:15] <%LysdexicAndVolingit> I feel like there's enough predator type games that are action games
[2:45:22] <anAngryHamster> The first Predator is a slasher move with the guise of an action film
[2:45:23] <pretendofriendo> legally DISTINCT Xenomorph
[2:45:24] <$KnivesEve> get scrappy doo in this game
[2:45:26] <HotSauceFiend> is gunslinger a bad or good killer?
[2:45:32] <%Estuko> Yeah!!
[2:45:33] <+scizor285> chucky would be cool.
[2:45:33] <%JoshManVGH> @coystick Whaaaat happened to the franchise?
[2:45:35] <VritraReiRei> how would as Slenderman even work? We dont even see him move, more like teleport. i cant even imagine him carrying people around with those noodle arms 🤔
[2:45:36] <@SoFarFetched> Paige wants a skeleton killer
[2:45:41] <+Gondab> I love playing Deathslinger.
[2:45:42] <$TheNewZealandStory> @Gondab deathslinger aint balanced, if the person playing can aim then there isnt much counterplay to that
[2:45:42] <HaroldDonchee> thatd be wild
[2:45:43] <freelancebabymaker> id also really like to see like an SCP or something just to scratch that creepypasta itch
[2:45:46] <devanmuse> Scrappy Doo as a survivor? Or a killer?
[2:45:49] <eyeobject> Charles E. Cheese
[2:45:49] <CandyCoatedConfection> Chucky if he could go into his human form could work.
[2:45:50] <Dymbledore> ranged killers strong but harder to play typically
[2:45:51] <Coystick> @JoshManVGH Director is a pedo
[2:45:54] <%Estuko> If there's a complaint about chucky being too small, just have his crazy human girlfriend carry him and flail him around to attack
[2:45:55] <Zeif00> Deathslinger is pretty good
[2:45:55] <+Emperor_Z> All of the existing killers are tall enough to carry people around, aren't they?
[2:45:56] <@MistyMntns> oh jeez now I'm just thinking of creepypastas that can be in the game and give us SCP 173
[2:46:08] <zenith0111> Slenderman lore is weird so idk what theyll do
[2:46:09] <pretendofriendo> @sofarfetched papyrus is the KILLER
[2:46:09] <+scizor285> is there any witches? would be a cool idea.
[2:46:12] <%3d_pbandj> Candy Man would be good especially with his movie coming out soon
[2:46:15] <EnzoTheGrand> Trickster isn't that hard
[2:46:18] <%king_wragles> Best killer is huntress, you are all wrong
[2:46:20] <freelancebabymaker> like SCP 106 maybe i think thats the old man that walks thru walls and dissolves people thats a very easy pick
[2:46:20] <Srthunda> any scooby doo villain would be an interesting swerve
[2:46:21] <EnzoTheGrand> just spray and pray
[2:46:22] <@SoFarFetched> The Hag in a sense
[2:46:23] <%Estuko> Hag is a swampy witch
[2:46:24] <%Estuko> LOL
[2:46:31] <$TheNewZealandStory> i would like a gruntilda style witch in dbd
[2:46:33] <%JoshManVGH> @coystick Oh that has some majorly unfortunate connotations to some of those movies choices...
[2:46:36] <+Sendrak70> Hag is a witch, straight up. Hexs and other magicy stuff
[2:46:36] <NeroInfinite> voodoo
[2:46:38] <@Jekado> OH GOD HOCUS POCUS FOR DBD LETS GOOOOO
[2:46:40] <@SoFarFetched> Hag is like a cannibal that does hexes
[2:46:42] <HotSauceFiend> My favorite killers are Spirit, PH, and Ghostface. If you know your maps, Ghostface is great
[2:46:43] <+Gondab> @TheNewZealandStory You have to catch someone before a pallet, if you don't then you can only get an injure
[2:46:47] <Dymbledore> trickster got buffs he didn't need and got to be stronger killer for it
[2:46:48] <+scizor285> hocus pocus. ooh
[2:46:55] <pretendofriendo> terminator
[2:46:56] <devanmuse> How about the Grass from "The Happening"?
[2:46:57] <+scizor285> can we get the witches from Sabrina?
[2:46:58] <Zeif00> @Emperor_Z Hag and Nurse are pretty short, but I believe the canon is that the Entity empowers the killers to be able to carry them
[2:47:03] <+scizor285> the sassy aunts.
[2:47:07] <Coystick> @JoshManVGH Actually makes it a scarier watch, you can see him airing his demons through the creeper
[2:47:11] <%JoshManVGH> Jaws!
[2:47:13] <@SoFarFetched> blue lagoon LUL
[2:47:13] <emper0rner0> What type of vampire killer would you like to see?
[2:47:15] <%Estuko> Morticia from Adam's Family, I'd lose just so she can carry me.
[2:47:17] <%Gouf_Troop> black lagoon
[2:47:18] <freelancebabymaker> i also wanna see some like really obscure slashers like the prowler or harry warden from my bloody valentine or something
[2:47:19] <@SoFarFetched> BLACK LAGOON
[2:47:20] <@SoFarFetched> geefO
[2:47:20] <zenith0111> Nemo PogChamp
[2:47:20] <+Wackywhitney> like Street Sharks?!
[2:47:21] <sydowoodo> babadook???????
[2:47:23] <+Gondab> Also indor areas neuter all ranged killers
[2:47:25] <%LysdexicAndVolingit> @SoFarFetched I thought I was loosing it
[2:47:29] <+JackalKing> Pretty sure the hag is supposed to be the Blair Witch combined with a wendigo
[2:47:31] <HotSauceFiend> I want a creature to represent a fear, like Spiders or Bees.
[2:47:32] <+ALazo> underwater is scary because it's like space
[2:47:35] <%JoshManVGH> Just a fucking great white shark!
[2:47:37] <+realm_forge> Shape of water creature?
[2:47:37] <TurtlesAndTentacles> She is tho
[2:47:38] <stantheman_97> xenomorph or predator. predator isn't horror but I think it could still fit
[2:47:41] <@Jekado> @SoFarFetched maybe she is like pat and can't tell from blue and black now
[2:47:42] <%Gouf_Troop> I would like a gialo killer
[2:47:44] <+Gondab> Billy is just a ranged killer that uses himself as the bullet.
[2:47:46] <+FoolsArcade> Jeepers Creepers
[2:47:47] <blue6sub6remnant6> That one guy, with the eyeballs from RE8 would be a fun fishman. But that's NEVER happening legally.
[2:47:47] <$TheNewZealandStory> @Gondab but catching someone before a pallet is easy when all you have to do is point and click at them
[2:47:50] <+Sendrak70> LGBTQ+ Icon Babadook?
[2:47:53] <@MistyMntns> DBD x Minecraft crossover and we get a Herobrine killer
[2:47:53] <churropoppa> street sharks
[2:47:58] <$KnivesEve> which of the classic universal monsters would be good pick?
[2:48:00] <pretendofriendo> you play as Adam's family characters and get chased by a Barbie
[2:48:00] <%3d_pbandj> Wolfman. Just a big ole Wolfman
[2:48:01] <masterofzin> the thing?
[2:48:02] <boomstickery> killer tomatoes
[2:48:02] <+scizor285> would be cool to do a Scooby doo type villain with a mask gimmick.
[2:48:02] <freelancebabymaker> what about like a rabid bear like in condemned
[2:48:02] <sydowoodo> that is scary
[2:48:04] <%ThomasOfTroy> Babadook would have been fun for pride month
[2:48:08] <Coystick> Jurassic Park raptor
[2:48:09] <%Estuko> @MistyMntns That'd be absolutely hilarious and I want it so much now
[2:48:12] <CalderGaming> the mimic from Annihilation
[2:48:20] <$TheNewZealandStory> bela lugosi dracula
[2:48:21] <+JackalKing> Mummy.
[2:48:22] <stantheman_97> wolfman
[2:48:22] <%Estuko> I want the classic Nosferatu dracula, the terrifying creepy one
[2:48:24] <+Wackywhitney> what about an adult white man that can't express his feelings?
[2:48:27] <%Idziman> a chupacabra
[2:48:27] <+Gondab> @TheNewZealandStory It's really hard to shoot a survivor jittering back and forth though.
[2:48:28] <+realm_forge> The Thing! It could shape shift into survivors!!!
[2:48:32] <%LysdexicAndVolingit> Little grey man killer?
[2:48:36] <EnzoTheGrand> you think the next killer will be an original one?
[2:48:37] <%TheWinged7> wow, way to out Eli like that
[2:48:38] <@MistyMntns> Give us Frankenstein's bride!
[2:48:40] <%EyeFarted> Paige wants an army of skeletons
[2:48:41] <eyeobject> my fear of intimacy?
[2:48:42] <+scizor285> chupacabra would be cool.
[2:48:42] <scrumbotime> BOTH DIRECTIONS
[2:48:42] <NeroInfinite> The Thing yeah.
[2:48:43] <%JoshManVGH> Oh man if they could get a Christopher Lee Dracula, that would be cool as shit
[2:48:46] <%king_wragles> oh we're on the shit thing again?
[2:48:46] <The_UnfathoMarble> T-1000
[2:48:47] <%alternative_flu> if you have an ass poop has to come out from there
[2:48:49] <Sogeki_Dan> gimme.... they killer clowns from outer space
[2:48:50] <%Estuko> @LysdexicAndVolingit Yeah! I mentioned it should be Crypto from Destroy All Humans lol
[2:48:52] <freelancebabymaker> i wanna see like a possessed girl like reagan from the exorcist or even like that scary ass possessed girl from that game FAITH
[2:48:56] <devanmuse> @realm_forge Voice chat makes that power pretty useless, though
[2:48:57] <EnzoTheGrand> Terminator would be awesome
[2:49:00] <anAngryHamster> Brendan Fraser survivor when?
[2:49:02] <+Sendrak70> If anyone knows how the Plague should be, it would be Paige.
[2:49:04] <Jetsfantasy> "Go to the bathroom, you are shitting yourself."
[2:49:05] <pretendofriendo> @the_unfathomarble I'd buy that for a dollar
[2:49:06] <$NitronStreams> ...
[2:49:06] <danielchong_> Girl-
[2:49:09] <+Gondab> I can't play Plague, she seems really weak without specific perks
[2:49:09] <zenith0111> DansGame
[2:49:10] <cyclone722> killer tomatoes!
[2:49:10] <+Wackywhitney> maybe they are. you don't know
[2:49:11] <ranarath> Need a doll-esque killer to hit that phobia.
[2:49:13] <sydowoodo> attack from the front and the back
[2:49:15] <stantheman_97> is that a banjo kazooie thing?
[2:49:20] <%JoshManVGH> Do they gave a Scythe welding Grim Reaper type yet?
[2:49:23] <EnzoTheGrand> imagine Terminator
[2:49:24] <Coystick> Please no
[2:49:26] <freelancebabymaker> like some horrible twisted and lanky possessed girl. like the zombie lady from the end of [REC]
[2:49:28] <+Karn_EX> Gruntilda for Dead By Daylight
[2:49:31] <+Basker17> any trypophobia killers yet?
[2:49:32] <viewtifulr> yet?
[2:49:33] <%AncelDeLambert> Attaaaaaaaaack of the Killer Tomatoooooooos! ATTAAAAAAAACK of the Killer TOMATOOOOOOS!
[2:49:40] <Coystick> Yeah why the FUCK no Terminator yet?
[2:49:43] <@SoFarFetched> "Paige never poops"
[2:49:44] <$AmanDotZip> i didnt think about it till you said that 😔
[2:49:47] <%TheWinged7> just like Pat
[2:49:47] <scrumbotime> i just have the worst mental image of the kazookie egg coughing noise but plague's ass is doing it
[2:49:50] <%AncelDeLambert> you and Pat, I swear
[2:49:51] <%SveriSageAdvice> it even makes a fart sound effect when she poops the egg
[2:49:56] <Sogeki_Dan> the leprechaun.
[2:49:57] <Dymbledore> ffs
[2:49:57] <viewtifulr> its a bird, so its a cloiaka or however you spell it
[2:49:57] <%Mister_McDerp> fempat

[2:49:58] <$AmanDotZip> what the hell 😂
[2:49:59] <CandyCoatedConfection> oh my god Paige

[3:02:52] <Rellim80> Stop. Drinking. It. It gave you a paralysis demon.
[3:02:58] <%Mister_McDerp> DO NOT drink the witch's brew, check with your doctor first
[3:02:58] <$paladin_guy_> paladin_guy_ subscribed with Prime. 
[3:03:01] <pretendofriendo> @catastrophecorvid nutmeg really helps me with creative writing
[3:03:10] <TurtlesAndTentacles> Bless paige
[3:03:11] <NPG_Eseph> LSD salt shaker
[3:03:18] <$hrbeck_> a paralysis demon is the price to pay for kickass dreams
[3:03:19] <krabthecrab> @Rellim80 They give a lot of XP once you defeat them tho
[3:03:25] <%3d_pbandj> is whole 30 really hard to do?
[3:03:27] <ChaosedStar> wwhats whole 30?
[3:03:29] <+CatastropheCorvid> @pretendofriendo II love nutmeg, but too much is not great for you.
[3:03:31] <$AmanDotZip> so wait how much control do people feel in dreams
[3:03:34] <$AmanDotZip> when they say lucid]
[3:03:36] <%VexicBayn> in that Hawaiian baby wood rose
[3:03:46] <stiffybiro> @chaosedstar 30 drugs
[3:04:08] <%VexicBayn> @amandotzip lucidity is kind of a spectrum, some.people just turn on God mode in there
[3:04:15] <razethetek> D: no cheese?!?!?! NotLikeThis
[3:04:16] <cyclone722> I'm out
[3:04:16] <%king_wragles> This queue is super long
[3:04:18] <%Mister_McDerp> but cheese is so good tho
[3:04:19] <eyeobject> NO HURTY SAND!?

[3:04:40] <%Mister_McDerp> this seems impossible
[3:04:40] <biglomix> So no eathing
[3:04:43] <krabthecrab> This is a case of the cure being worse than the disease
[3:04:45] <sporeian94> Just stop eating processed foods. That's literally all there is to it. All these speciality diets are bullshit. Any diet that says "don't eat shit food" is gonna make you lose weight
[3:04:46] <%3d_pbandj> no chickpeas!!!???
[3:04:47] <JobbedBone> no peanuts? D:
[3:04:49] <$AmanDotZip> @VexicBayn interesting, most control ive had was in the moment, never been on god mode
[3:04:50] <%TheLemuroid> It's actually not that hard
[3:04:51] <%king_wragles> Oh ya! Can we get the cauldron salad recipe @PeachSaliva

[3:05:20] <bhargavaman> i've been keto for like a year now, it's the BESSSSST
[3:05:23] <biglomix> so learn nothing
[3:05:24] <sporeian94> Oh so just eat healthy food? That's not a diet that's just nutrion!
[3:05:25] <jillsandwichrpd> rip toilet
[3:05:27] <@SoFarFetched> JUST LEMME EAT IT geefJuice geefJuice geefJuice geefJuice geefJuice geefJuice geefJuice geefJuice geefJuice geefJuice
[3:05:31] <$AmanDotZip> did it work?
[3:05:32] <$Niney_Who> How do you eat Eggs without butter
[3:05:35] <$hrbeck_> so meat
[3:05:36] <+CatastropheCorvid> @MoroseLoki The poverty diet? I've been there.
[3:05:40] <viewtifulr> ham after ham
[3:05:46] <%Mister_McDerp> meats back on the menu boys!
[3:05:49] <krabthecrab> How do you eat eggs WITH butter?
[3:05:50] <+scizor285> so like keto?
[3:05:53] <%VexicBayn> just whole hams on the bone
[3:05:57] <%EyeFarted> i don't know if I can go 30 days without having a hot garbonzo bean on my face
[3:05:59] <bevyrage> @Niney_Who you can fry or steam eggs on a non-stick pan
[3:05:59] <$Niney_Who> @krabthecrab scramble
[3:06:01] <+Gondab> I stick a fork into a potato and just eat it skin and all
[3:06:03] <NPG_Eseph> im just too addicted to carbs
[3:06:13] <+realm_forge> Keto is freakin awesome
[3:06:15] <krabthecrab> Never heard of putting butter in your scrambled eggs
[3:06:25] <$AmanDotZip> but that sort of sprint sounds like it would come back after the 30 days
[3:06:26] <%VexicBayn> the whole30 is kind of like extreme double dare
[3:06:26] <stiffybiro> i consume: energy drinks, beer, rum, pot noodles, microwave curry; i haven’t died yet, therefore the diet must work SeemsGood SeemsGood
[3:06:31] <bevyrage> most peeps use butter to keep the eggs from sticking to the pan, and causing it to burn
[3:06:31] <+realm_forge> I dropped 60lbs on keto
[3:06:37] <$StaceMcGate> just doing my daily check-in, has Paige been to the eye doctor?
[3:06:43] <breadwitchery> i've heard keto is like... Not Great bc we're not made for it but it depends on the person
[3:06:49] <$Niney_Who> So it's like booting your PC in SAfe Mode but FOod
[3:06:56] <bevyrage> yes
[3:06:57] <$ZeldaAssassiin> I would love to try something like that but I am not a veggie person
[3:06:59] <+Gondab> Man I need more 'Shin Black' Ramen, that's addictive in how good it is
[3:07:02] <breadwitchery> i wanna go get a food allergy test so bad LMAO i'm intrigued
[3:07:05] <%VexicBayn> diets are simply not one size fits all
[3:07:12] <freelancebabymaker> @breadwitchery i dont trust it because it sounds like it can give you some weird ass eating habits
[3:07:26] <@SoFarFetched> I always hear mixed things about keto
[3:07:27] <%AncelDeLambert> diets depend on the person
[3:07:27] <+MoroseLoki> @gondab yeah it is
[3:07:28] <NPG_Eseph> talk to ur Dr. about keto first yall. ive heard more than enough first hand accounts of it destroying peoples gall bladders to reccomend just doing it unsupervised.
[3:07:28] <breadwitchery> also hi ❤️ i'm a lil stressed but okay
[3:07:33] <krabthecrab> Keto got too expensive and time consuming for me
[3:07:34] <+TopTieramisu> a life without french fries? oof
[3:07:38] <%TheWinged7> Keto probably should be only done supervised by a Dr/nutritionist
[3:07:45] <+ThatGuyfromMars> I knew a guy who went on the Keto diet for a year and he got hospitalized
[3:07:47] <%AncelDeLambert> not enough bread
[3:07:48] <scrumbotime> I cut out bread and a lot of sugar for a bit, and somehow it jumpstarted my metabolism and now I'm 100 pounds down and wolfing down burgers and garbage and not gaining it back
[3:07:48] <%alternative_flu> stress sux
[3:07:51] <pretendofriendo> I would be buff but I buy bread.... I love bread more than life
[3:07:52] <+scizor285> hope things get better breadwitch
[3:07:53] <%Mister_McDerp> different people have very different digestive needs
[3:07:55] <JobbedBone> work sucks

[3:08:07] <+NomieOhs> everlywell . com has a great food sensitivity test that you can do at home and send in
[3:08:08] <$NitronStreams> The soothing sounds of murder
[3:08:18] <pleasedontyelle> @breadwitchery sending you good vibes
[3:08:25] <+Gondab> @MoroseLoki It's just spicy enough to heat you without being overpowering with it. So good.
[3:08:26] <%AncelDeLambert> I got minor stressed out today because I didn't like a Kurosawa film as much as everyone else in the group
[3:08:27] <breadwitchery> your lovely pearls and voice shall soothe me 😌 also the screams of fear 😌
[3:08:28] <Jetsfantasy> The sweet tones of "BALLS IN MY ASS!"
[3:08:38] <breadwitchery> @pleasedontyelle ty ❤️

[3:08:39] <+MoroseLoki> what^
[3:08:40] <+ThatGuyfromMars> I can't give up bread, bagels are my life
[3:08:43] <+Ches_Neckbeard> Paige that was the pregnancy

[3:09:11] <theoriginalbigboy3535> Paige is a v-tuber now?
[3:09:11] <%AncelDeLambert> people seem to forget that a large part of keto should be VEGETABLES
[3:09:16] <$hrbeck_> glasses coming?
[3:09:18] <@SoFarFetched> Thats Jake
[3:09:18] <%AncelDeLambert> just not starchy ones

[3:09:55] <%Estuko> @NPG_Eseph I do not have the required size to perform this experiment
[3:09:55] <+ThatGuyfromMars> @NPG_Eseph sounds like my new catch phrase
[3:10:03] <scrumbotime> the goal is to get healthier, if less weight happens at the same time, then that's good

[3:16:58] <blue6sub6remnant6> So... tictoc is doing the waifu thing, but less ironically, and with dead polytheistic deities?
[3:17:04] <+scizor285> @joshmanvgh plzzz I know people like this.

[3:18:40] <mr_saturday93> I just want you to bully pat though
[3:18:41] <scrumbotime> It's because he's like a tiny dog for you, you can keep him in a bag like an accessory
[3:18:44] <pretendofriendo> BULL PATS BUTT
[3:18:45] <+ThatGuyfromMars> my favorite tiktok is the one with the cat looking so bored with a martini infront of it and a disco strobe going on with some weird russian soul playing
[3:18:50] <DianaTheAscian> But does Pat exist outside of you?
[3:18:52] <eyeobject> geif is more important and cute
[3:18:53] <+scizor285> well it's a very nice vtuber
[3:18:55] <+Gondab> charge coming
[3:18:58] <eco419> LUL
[3:18:59] <@Jekado> @AncelDeLambert its like how I did't get instant gram crackers when i signed up to Instagram what a rip off. geefBlank
[3:19:00] <%JoshManVGH> Cause we wanna see Pat do the low effort VTube stuff on his stream.
[3:19:03] <NPG_Eseph> i specifically turned off the pat video i was watching to come here.
[3:19:05] <%TheLemuroid> I would like to see the talking toilet realized
[3:19:08] <DedlokPM> Pat's vtuber should just be an orb
[3:19:12] <%YakumoYomi> The real question is when is Gief and Elmo getting one.
[3:19:16] <+EroHoney> Paige being independent and someone is like "yeah but you're gonna marry Pat so don't do that :/"
[3:19:19] <+scizor285> fyp are great for seeing cool cosplays on niche communities like danganronpa
[3:19:19] <+GinAndRoses> whenever pat isn't on screen the chat should be asking, 'where's pat!'
[3:19:21] <+DrHentaiPhD> pretty sure my FYP thinks im a anarcho-communist punk trans lesbian in her late 30s. I am a 23 year old cis-male electrician
[3:19:22] <%JoshManVGH> Just a poorly MS Painted toilet.
[3:19:24] <theoriginalbigboy3535> @PeachSaliva I recognize you are separate person than Pat, but also nothing could be more surreal than seeing Pat on tiktok
[3:19:24] <VritraReiRei> also people forget, Vtuber models take a LOOONNNGGG time to make. Paiges model started back in October!
[3:19:30] <%king_wragles> She over shot you
[3:19:33] <pipersoulhaven> you say you arentany good but youre really food at running the killer
[3:19:33] <$NitronStreams> blind
[3:19:37] <@SoFarFetched> LUL

[3:19:39] <DuoScratch> rooKek
[3:19:41] <$TheNewZealandStory> paige why
[3:19:41] <%Estuko> she went past you super fast lol
[3:19:42] <ggnore12334> I just internally screamed
[3:19:42] <Faustgesicht> Holy shit
[3:19:43] <TheFramedWarlock> Pat's Vtuber should just be a balding Cacodemon that opens and closes it's mouth like the canadians from South Park
[3:19:44] <%Mister_McDerp> LUL
[3:19:44] <@SoFarFetched> yyou gave it to her to be nice
[3:19:45] <+akabuldozer> She ran past you XD
[3:19:47] <DedlokPM> ronanLuls
[3:19:47] <scrumbotime> You're giving the killer a false sense of security
[3:19:50] <JobbedBone> pat's would be a little short him, held up by Crazy Talk
[3:19:55] <pretendofriendo> Pat was Odo the whole time
[3:19:55] <+Gondab> Did Paige just stare right into a wall?
[3:20:01] <%alternative_flu> pat can do the best floss dance
[3:20:04] <%JoshManVGH> I shall slam this plate in my face and see how you like it!

[3:20:16] <ggnore12334> krbladAngy
[3:20:18] <@Jekado> yeah stream had a lag spike also
[3:20:26] <+scizor285> I like tiktok for finding music I missed out on
[3:20:33] <+scizor285> or animes
[3:20:35] <+ThatGuyfromMars> haha same
[3:20:40] <breadwitchery> i like tiktok for beauty tips tbh.. they have nice hair tutorials
[3:20:40] <%JoshManVGH> So if you where to Tic a Tok, what would you like to do?
[3:20:51] <+ThatGuyfromMars> I kinda hate how good some of those tiktok meme songs are
[3:20:57] <@Jekado> Mustard eating

[3:20:57] <sydowoodo> video of elmo
[3:21:00] <%alternative_flu> WHAT
[3:21:03] <@Jekado> ELMO yeee
[3:21:03] <MelonSouda> I'm sure this question has been asked and answered many times already, but why did Paige go the vtuber route? Just because she was feeling it?
[3:21:04] <+The_Protagonist> oh i thought that was just my connection, i guess others had it tooo
[3:21:07] <eyeobject> tik tok with the baby
[3:21:07] <+scizor285> so many people with nice hair on tiktok. so cool
[3:21:07] <%Estuko> I feel like PAige's tik toks would just revolve around her doting on Elmo and his shinanigens
[3:21:08] <blue6sub6remnant6> @Jekado Yes.
[3:21:10] <pretendofriendo> MAKE PUPPETS!!!!
[3:21:13] <sydowoodo> elmo and gief

[3:21:25] <+scizor285> Paige did you see the adult swim trend on tiktok?
[3:21:27] <%king_wragles> Do those weird dances to lip synched music, but like really bad and you knock something over every time (without getting hurt of course)
[3:21:33] <%YakumoYomi> "Not creative" she says, having made the Castle Superbeast theme song
[3:21:35] <+Wackywhitney> only Elmo content
[3:21:35] <%king_wragles> or something to show off your voice skills
[3:21:38] <$KnivesEve> show a clock going tic toc

[3:22:02] <pretendofriendo> make Zangief the star
[3:22:03] <+Ches_Neckbeard> Paige's tiktok would be her trying to do an actual high effort video then she falls down some stairs or walks into a door

[3:22:07] <@Jekado> @SoFarFetched and on fire.. geefFine geefFine geefFine

[3:22:31] <eyeobject> Review different hurty sands on tik tok
[3:22:35] <%king_wragles> Oh hey, has anyone made Paige's clafoutis before? How long does it keep?

[3:24:52] <@SoFarFetched> IS THIS WHY
[3:25:05] <@SoFarFetched> geefBruh
[3:25:08] <scrumbotime> paige is playing the game on a friedge
[3:25:12] <+The_Protagonist> NO YOU'RE BIG AND STRONG
[3:25:13] <%Estuko> Being Gay was considered a crime (still is in places....) why not do crime while you're at it
[3:25:13] <breadwitchery> also this is random but i don't know vtuber stuff at ALL but ur model is so expressive i love it!!!
[3:25:14] <+scizor285> I feel like you could do musical stuff on tiktok.
[3:25:15] <%3d_pbandj> Aren't you 6'1?
[3:25:20] <%TheWinged7> Paige big tiny
[3:25:21] <scrumbotime> HAH
[3:25:31] <breadwitchery> paige is emotionally tall
[3:25:31] <$rdark_ksu> Paige is playing on an old game boy screen to even the odds. Keep it interesting
[3:25:33] <+Gondab> 'Pat standing with chocolate bunny.png'
[3:25:41] <@SoFarFetched> She's 5'4 @3d_pbandj
[3:25:53] <viewtifulr> then you look over to pat and comfirm your psaBig
[3:25:57] <pretendofriendo> we put Zangief in outfits
[3:26:03] <freelancebabymaker> oh yeah that place is psychotic
[3:26:05] <+scizor285> over YouTube?
[3:26:07] <%3d_pbandj> @SoFarFetched Pat is THAT short since she's taller then him!
[3:26:10] <$KnivesEve> go on tic tok ad explain goatsee
[3:26:10] <%JoshManVGH> Therefore, do twitter mockery on tictok.
[3:26:13] <theoriginalbigboy3535> @PeachSaliva Why'd you move to v-tubin? Just more straightforward?
[3:26:15] <SkinnyRite> All social media bad
[3:26:15] <+ALazo> 9gag
[3:26:17] <reeeee2233> I'm sure if you put twitch clips on there you'd get a butt ton of followers
[3:26:18] <SirBrawler18> Hey, Paige I want to say thanks. You and Pat are the ones who got me into DBD. I love playing Survivor.
[3:26:19] <Zeif00> Real militant people on Tiktok
[3:26:22] <+DrTribal> i was about to say twitter is the worst for me lol but i don't watch tiktok
[3:26:31] <%AncelDeLambert> whatever platform most appeals to Mean Girls will be the meanest
[3:26:34] <breadwitchery> absolutely yes. youtube has very toxic Creators (eg some really mean troll-y creators that are big) but tiktok USERS are like
[3:26:38] <breadwitchery> ACTIVELY SO MEAN
[3:26:39] <ChaosedStar> do fan fic readings on tiktok
[3:26:41] <@SoFarFetched> @theoriginalbigboy3535 helps her stream more,since a lot of the times she can't be on cam because of hives/lupus and such.
[3:26:44] <Wiiplayah43> Doubt that, I've seen HORRID takes on twitter
[3:26:50] <+scizor285> that's so sad to hear @breadwitchery
[3:26:53] <breadwitchery> like the comments can be SO mean or a stitch or a duet
[3:27:10] <$NitronStreams> BOLTH
[3:27:11] <scrumbotime> bowth
[3:27:12] <%alternative_flu> there are way too many nasty people out there
[3:27:18] <aangwutang1> dimensions one thru nine release all shame
[3:27:30] <eco419> Tru
[3:27:30] <Wiiplayah43> worse than calling charity for kids with cancer "nonsense"?
[3:27:30] <pretendofriendo> listen Paige, just go on tictok live and read the Hobbit
[3:27:34] <freelancebabymaker> and its like SO easy for stuff to get a shitload of views on there too
[3:27:36] <+scizor285> so it becomes this toxic circle of trying to demean people?
[3:27:37] <ChaosedStar> its the modern version of the old youtube reaction videos @PeachSaliva
[3:27:38] <+FuriousCabinBoy> people always say twitter is the most toxic, but tiktok literally promoted an algorithm that picked the "most attractive people" on the main page
[3:27:50] <Holofono> it's called 'content'
[3:27:56] <+garbagegenesis> tiktok is just the zoomer high school experience
[3:27:57] <%ThomasOfTroy> Thkis is why I just don't really use social media at all
[3:28:04] <breadwitchery> also tiktok often mocks ppl just for being cringey and then the comment section is everyone sarcastically going "this is great babes xxx" to be mean
[3:28:08] <SkinnyRite> @Wiiplayah43 if you're basis is an individual take over the millions of people that exist on both platforms then yes
[3:28:19] <viewtifulr> Cognitive hazard tictok
[3:28:26] <+scizor285> isn't tiktok's algorithm against LGBTQ+ creators? or am I wrong?
[3:28:32] <Wiiplayah43> @SkinnyRite far from individual, that was just a sample
[3:28:36] <+DrHentaiPhD> the zoomers scare me
[3:28:45] <HaroldDonchee> i mean.. thats not really surprising
[3:28:46] <freelancebabymaker> the kids are not slright
[3:28:57] <pretendofriendo> tictok has a lot of mean girls, and by meangurls I do mean antivax Christians
[3:29:05] <$KnivesEve> kids are a mistake lol
[3:29:05] <+scizor285> I feel like people should be fine to be cringey. we were all weird on the internet.
[3:29:14] <SkinnyRite> One Fear
[3:29:23] <%JoshManVGH> So tictok is the DBD of Social Media?
[3:29:29] <@SoFarFetched> Reddit posts can be wild too geefAwk
[3:29:32] <scrumbotime> But you could have a duet where everyone drinks the mustard
[3:29:32] <bevyrage> tiktok still has too high a population of old men singing duets with prepubescent kids
[3:29:46] <+Urgoslav> peach, did you get your model from the same person who made Silvervale?
[3:29:47] <+garbagegenesis> @scrumbotime CEASE
[3:30:03] <ChaosedStar> Cringe culture is dead, we all just have fun now. laynaYIKE laynaYIKE laynaYIKE
[3:30:04] <+The_Protagonist> well it's also probably like... most of the time people on twitter won't make a video of their comments but on tiktok people will no fear post their face saying insane stuff calling out nothing
[3:30:13] <+LensWander> Someone could post a TikTok of themselves drinking a glass of water and someone would have something mean to say about that :(
[3:30:17] <freelancebabymaker> start a mustard drinking fad
[3:30:20] <%BakiinPlaysStuff> These zoomers got me shook. Start going after jobs because you have a video game opinion or something
[3:30:21] <KongrawDarts> On tiktok they will do a cool dance while saying mean shit to you
[3:30:22] <%JoshManVGH> Look like a thing people are having fun with and BOOM cespool of toxic hostility
[3:30:27] <scrumbotime> Mustard Chuggin' Tic Toks
[3:30:30] <+scizor285> yah I can see why you like to lurk.
[3:30:30] <aangwutang1> use ur brain power and do a backflip
[3:30:37] <+scizor285> I try to leave positive comments
[3:30:41] <+scizor285> on tiktok
[3:30:45] <pretendofriendo> @scrumbotime slow clap
[3:30:50] <+MoroseLoki> water is good
[3:30:54] <+ThatGuyfromMars> ugh you're drinking TAP water lol scrub
[3:30:55] <+tigerfang86> bruh
[3:30:55] <breadwitchery> also crying at how u were like "breadwitchery let me know if you agree - tiktok is mean" bc i know u meant we're on the same "side" of tiktok, but i love the idea that i'm the judge of meanness
[3:30:57] <+tigerfang86> bruhhhhhh
[3:30:58] <+The_Protagonist> Tiktok comment: WATER IS NOT GOOD. THAT'S STUPID. YOU'RE STUPID.
[3:31:01] <ChaosedStar> i bet thats cheap tap water!
[3:31:01] <breadwitchery> i am the Cruelty Expert,
[3:31:02] <+scizor285> wow that's so mean.
[3:31:04] <%AncelDeLambert> what the FUCK?!
[3:31:04] <pretendofriendo> chugg mustard
[3:31:05] <Holofono> wow jeezus
[3:31:07] <SkinnyRite> Maybe teenagers?
[3:31:07] <+Wackywhitney> big oof
[3:31:10] <%AncelDeLambert> holy shit I hate children
[3:31:10] <%VexicBayn> it's because zoomers have no capacity for empathy
[3:31:14] <stiffybiro> it means more when they’re videoing them telling you how stupid you are than a 20s stupid typed message
[3:31:21] <+CatastropheCorvid> That's what you get when most of the users for a given platform haven't yet developed empathy.
[3:31:24] <%JoshManVGH> then you counter tok with a tic of drinking water angrily while flipping the bird.
[3:31:30] <+scizor285> court is in session.
[3:31:34] <scrumbotime> THE JUDGE OF TIC AND OR TOK
[3:31:34] <+The_Protagonist> to be fair a lot of the cruel people are not as young as you'd think, like geez
[3:31:37] <Randoseph> "I will not download tiktok, if a tiktok is funny enough it will breach containment and make its way onto another platform. It's quality control." - random post i saw
[3:31:38] <breadwitchery> LMAOOOOOO
[3:31:44] <+scizor285> like something out of Ace Attorney
[3:31:52] <breadwitchery> you totally didn't, you're fine, i know what you meant for sure HAHAHA
[3:31:52] <+BoboDaHobo> it's a social platform for clout chasing children, of course it's full of assholes
[3:32:02] <stiffybiro> also tiktok is filled with mean kids that never got a real personality growing up other than being the bullies at school
[3:32:07] <breadwitchery> It is I, the Honourable Breadwitchery, who shall decide if your feelings are hurt,
[3:32:08] <ChaosedStar> i learn a lot of cool stuff on it
[3:32:15] <+SquishiiFX> @randoseph agree 100
[3:32:16] <+Shubreaker> I don't :)
[3:32:16] <breadwitchery> tiktok has so many cool resources
[3:32:19] <SirBrawler18> Yeah I try not to comment unless I'm CERTAIN the people will most likely not reply with hurtful things. Like this chat!
[3:32:22] <+scizor285> I love tiktok for all the artists on there. YouTube makes it so hard to monetize art.
[3:32:38] <blue6sub6remnant6> To be fair, listening to this convo has convinced to never use it.
[3:32:39] <pretendofriendo> Paige, sell me merch
[3:32:45] <mushrooming> mushrooming subscribed at Tier 1. 
[3:32:55] <+SquishiiFX> take me back to 2005 YouTube
[3:32:59] <pretendofriendo> I demand stickers
[3:33:03] <Wiiplayah43> That seems like the summary: tiktok is full of kids. Twitter is full of grown-ass adults who sap your faith in humanity & laugh in your face while they do it.
[3:33:05] <freelancebabymaker> need a trucker hat with a lil peach on it
[3:33:10] <+MoroseLoki> so I'm staring at Netflix and just see Twilight everywhere should I watch Twilight?
[3:33:19] <Tracazoid> Peach Saliva branded Mustard
[3:33:20] <SEHVASH> Does Page is the gay?
[3:33:22] <+scizor285> God I love watching hand made merch being shown off to 2000s era music.
[3:33:23] <+realm_forge> I would totally wear a mustard queen shirt

[3:33:46] <+The_Protagonist> a friend of mine absolutely took off on tiktok and basically was able to make a job out of streaming due to getting a huge tiktok following
[3:33:50] <%kyh9> I can't believe someone was so mad about my Demogorgon Ultra-rare add-on that they accused me of cheating with wall-hacks
[3:33:50] <scrumbotime> HOW
[3:33:52] <+Shubreaker> I give it another year before Tiktok cuts into their small business users and ruins the platform for them
[3:33:52] <%JoshManVGH> Having heard horror stories about oughts media platforms, hard pass.
[3:33:54] <BinaryBetrayer> Replica poopy boots for sale.
[3:33:57] <+scizor285> imagine a peach saliva hat with fox ears on it.

[3:34:41] <@SoFarFetched> yeah sometimes its best to heal right by the hook
[3:34:43] <@SoFarFetched> while the killer is busy
[3:34:46] <$NitronStreams> If someone flicked their flashlight at me like that I would leave them to die
[3:34:48] <+NomieOhs> A McDonalds bag with you peeking out of the top
[3:34:49] <%kyh9> Demogorgon chase music is pretty good
[3:34:49] <%VexicBayn> that behavior is why survivor is not fun
[3:34:49] <@SoFarFetched> or else you waste more time trying to find a safe spot to heal
[3:34:51] <+brigiethebaguette> or a mug that asys ' balls in my ass'
[3:34:51] <+SquishiiFX> constant terror radius tho
[3:34:59] <freelancebabymaker> i am a large man with long hair and a beard who does not know how to diy give me my sily fruity hat
[3:35:02] <BinaryBetrayer> This music is audible stress I'd be unable to play.
[3:35:05] <SirBrawler18> Been meaning to ask, are the Twins like really bad or something. I've been playing a long time since their release and haven't gone against a single one. I've even played against Blight more.
[3:35:27] <%kyh9> Peach, which is more disadvantageous: an enlarged terror radius, or a shrunk one?
[3:35:33] <@SoFarFetched> the twins are still played,think people still aren't used to the whole switching thing.
[3:35:33] <pretendofriendo> see I could play this if I listened to upbeat music like WHAM
[3:35:33] <+Taisuru> Just do 5 gens
[3:35:37] <emper0rner0> Trickster buff comes out on Tuesday
[3:35:47] <+The_Protagonist> i forgot the twins existed, i've never seen anyone even mention them
[3:35:50] <%king_wragles> That was a killer perk, you're fine
[3:35:51] <@SoFarFetched> no it was surge Paige
[3:35:53] <%kyh9> No, it's surge
[3:35:55] <%VexicBayn> @kyh9 killer dependant
[3:35:55] <@SoFarFetched> you didn't do anyhting
[3:36:00] <JobbedBone> THPS music
[3:36:00] <+mrfriendlybro> aside from camping and slugging, twins are pretty mediocre
[3:36:01] <Faustgesicht> Twins can be really intimidating, but really strong
[3:36:07] <$TheNewZealandStory> you gotta bring technician for those skill check
[3:36:09] <TurtlesAndTentacles> The Doo doo of love paige
[3:36:13] <+mrfriendlybro> they're real good at camping and slugging though
[3:36:19] <%kyh9> @VexicBayn Hmm. I would imagine for demogorgon, that having lower terror radius is better
[3:36:20] <freelancebabymaker> serj tankian
[3:36:20] <Zeif00> Twins are good, the way people tend to play them makes matches last forever
[3:36:33] <reeeee2233> correct me if I'm wrong, but can't you punt one of the twins?
[3:36:42] <@SoFarFetched> yeah you can kick one of them
[3:36:42] <+scizor285> I bet if you posted clips of you playing dbd on tiktok. it would get toxic real quick lol
[3:36:51] <Faustgesicht> yep, you can punt victor when he misses a lunge
[3:36:52] <+LensWander> I remember the first time I faced the Twins, I was like "what is that baby-looking thing running towards me?"
[3:36:57] <JobbedBone> banana banana banana terracotta
[3:37:01] <%JoshManVGH> How much do the crows mater?
[3:37:02] <+Taisuru> Or as I call him Pat
[3:37:09] <%kyh9> Hey Y'all, what's the most annoying ultra-rare killer add-on to go up against?
[3:37:17] <+scizor285> mori
[3:37:19] <%kyh9> In your opinions
[3:37:19] <Faustgesicht> don't call him baby or bvhr gets mad appearantly
[3:37:21] <+SquishiiFX> @jobbedbone TERRACOTTA 🥧
[3:37:26] <%kyh9> I mean killer-specific add-on
[3:37:34] <$TheNewZealandStory> franklins aint an add on
[3:37:35] <@SoFarFetched> Yeah BHVR gets mad and twitch gets mad about it
[3:37:48] <+Ixiah> will you ever play path of exile on stream ? :)
[3:37:49] <@SoFarFetched> cause a lot of streamers got in trouble when The Twins first came out because of all the jokes
[3:37:57] <%kyh9> That's just a perk
[3:38:00] <+SquishiiFX> it
[3:38:06] <%kyh9> I've heard people get mad about red-paint-brush
[3:38:21] <+SquishiiFX> Franklin is for breaking hands with keys in them
[3:38:22] <%kyh9> I get people bitching me out about using Leprosy Lichen
[3:38:23] <Faustgesicht> Wraith's silent Bongs
[3:38:35] <pipersoulhaven> i like the hag one that doesnt tell surviviors when they trigger traps
[3:38:35] <+akabuldozer> Silent Wraith is fun
[3:38:36] <+MackFighters> Mike Myers can get a free Mori at level 3 with his add ons
[3:38:37] <%kyh9> Which lets me see survivor auras any time I travel in the upside-down
[3:38:49] <SirBrawler18> Same. The only Killers I really play are Michael and PH
[3:38:49] <+LensWander> I hear a lot of people complain about the Finger
[3:38:50] <+akabuldozer> I personally hate perma-3 Myers
[3:39:14] <%VexicBayn> survivor mains hate everything that makes killers fun to play
[3:39:16] <Faustgesicht> Demo has such a cute trot
[3:39:19] <@SoFarFetched> paige NEEDS her medicinals
[3:39:19] <%VexicBayn> roast me chat
[3:39:25] <freelancebabymaker> its so funny seeing the demogorgon carrying people and throwing them on hooks
[3:39:27] <ChaosedStar> seeing demi just pick up someone is weird haha
[3:39:40] <+SquishiiFX> fav killer demo boi
[3:39:41] <ggnore12334> I shall make you hungry with this but it all comes down to if you like it or not
[3:39:47] <%kyh9> Demogorgon ultra-rares make people accuse me of cheating
[3:39:48] <ChangelingBard> That monster has a weird face, but I'm not turned off per say
[3:39:52] <+SquishiiFX> death by bunghole
[3:39:53] <scrumbotime> Dig that butthole SHUT
[3:39:56] <freelancebabymaker> CUZ LIKE HES JUST AN ANIMAL ISNT HE???
[3:39:57] <intestinal_bleeding> Demo is fun to go against too
[3:39:58] <+TopTieramisu> digging ass
[3:40:00] <sydowoodo> what does that do
[3:40:02] <+RowenCleric> wait I thought you didnt like buttholes
[3:40:06] <blue8moon> paige just obsessed with butt holes
[3:40:10] <+SquishiiFX> is that the cosmic horror way to eat ass?
[3:40:11] <scrumbotime> @RowenCleric that's why she closed it up
[3:40:12] <ChaosedStar> thought we were not infavor of butthole stuff Kappa
[3:40:14] <ggnore12334> everybody everybody everybody run murdering murdering murdering fun
[3:40:18] <SirBrawler18> Why must so many interdimensional portals look like buttholes?
[3:40:19] <+The_Protagonist> yeah i was gonna say "doesn't he get alerted to that?"
[3:40:19] <@SoFarFetched> @sydowoodo lets the demogorgon travel through it when he sets them up
[3:40:28] <+brigiethebaguette> a pointy butthole
[3:40:30] <+RowenCleric> ah I see a rich butthole
[3:40:31] <+scizor285> have you ever watched any of saminations dbd videos?
[3:40:39] <pipersoulhaven> might wanna hunt for hatch
[3:40:43] <JobbedBone> The monsters from the movie Mimic could be cool.
[3:40:51] <+LensWander> The first Demo I played against carried me to the hatch so I have a soft spot for that killer
[3:40:54] <+The_Protagonist> well i meant more that she was healing you without you moving right after, so that was more on her haha
[3:41:06] <%kyh9> two survivors down with two generators left, very ballsy
[3:41:09] <+MoroseLoki> Hes also in Fortnite I seen and a game called Smite oof my brain remembers useless crap
[3:41:14] <%kyh9> I would just let the other girl die and look for the hatch
[3:41:29] <ChangelingBard> I blame society
[3:41:31] <%kyh9> streaming tax
[3:41:40] <JobbedBone> they put the ninja turtles in smite I think
[3:41:43] <%kyh9> You could...save her
[3:41:46] <SirBrawler18> Who did your model it looks great
[3:41:54] <%king_wragles> She's actively trying to die
[3:41:57] <%kyh9> do it paige!
[3:41:59] <%kyh9> It was her first
[3:42:01] <+CrimKangaroo> Paige does not save....women
[3:42:02] <%kyh9> Now it's her econd
[3:42:08] <blue6sub6remnant6> @kyh9 No, that's too obvious. The killer would expect it.
[3:42:08] <+MoroseLoki> If you save her do you get more points?
[3:42:15] <+CrimKangaroo> unless it's to murder them later
[3:42:16] <%king_wragles> OR the other Kate will just make sure neither of you make it
[3:42:20] <%VexicBayn> Paige must fight her natural instinct to rescue VVimmyn
[3:42:20] <+The_Protagonist> bonk
[3:42:20] <%JoshManVGH> She try to get herself off the hook?
[3:42:32] <pepzi_boyz> Is hook caning frowned upon or no?
[3:42:35] <HotSauceFiend> protection hits
[3:42:40] <pepzi_boyz> *camping
[3:42:44] <postmortempc> What the f is that killer?
[3:42:48] <+LensWander> @MoroseLoki There's also a perk that increases the BP bonus for safe unhooks
[3:42:53] <+SquishiiFX> are you a VA? voice is intox AF
[3:43:00] <+PenmanLupine> its the demagorgan from Stranger Things
[3:43:01] <%kyh9> @kyh9 It's funny, I never assume the other survivors will try to save the hooked ones after one full hook
[3:43:02] <Valdorick> Salty bitch killer
[3:43:03] <SirBrawler18> Welp that's all folks

[3:43:58] <+SquishiiFX> yeah not on this Christian minecraft server

[3:44:45] <@SoFarFetched> geefO
[3:44:54] <HotSauceFiend> Nemesis seems overpowerd
[3:45:06] <pipersoulhaven> r.p.d is the worst t.t
[3:45:06] <HotSauceFiend> I've never wona match against him yet
[3:45:08] <%JoshManVGH> Buttholes aren't real, space isn't real, ghosts aren't real. These streams are so educational!
[3:45:15] <SirBrawler18> I think it's back up for custom games.
[3:45:20] <@SoFarFetched> yeah it depends on the nemesis,they're either really good or not great.
[3:45:37] <%SquishiiFX> SquishiiFX subscribed at Tier 1. 
[3:45:45] <+The_Protagonist> he doesn't seem as good as Pyramid Head, that's for sure
[3:45:53] <redxstarfire> woahh your avatar is so cool!
[3:45:53] <pipersoulhaven> i wanted to learn how to do rigging but i didnt understand it
[3:45:55] <+CrimKangaroo> @PeachSaliva , which do you think will happen firts; you finish DS3, or NASA lands people on the moon again?
[3:45:58] <freelancebabymaker> its weird like having these super powerful survivor horror guys in here cuz like how do you make them feel just as strong as they do in their original games?
[3:46:08] <+Gondab> Pulling down a pallet infront of a goof Nemisis is useless because you'll always get tagged.
[3:46:21] <@MelBrooksKA> Extremely NSFW
[3:46:22] <postmortempc> Wait is that person who rigged melody?
[3:46:28] <+scizor285> whisper did a great job!

[3:49:57] <%VexicBayn> I think I'd kill myself publicly
[3:50:02] <$AzureGale> That WOULD be upsetting
[3:50:04] <Malilonghero> 24/7 A WEEK
[3:50:05] <%king_wragles> Zangeif wants what Zangeif wants
[3:50:06] <sydowoodo> zangief said gay rights
[3:50:06] <+CrimKangaroo> @postmortempc that's what some people said. will have to check the VOD
[3:50:08] <susukouhai> oh no
[3:50:12] <+mgoodinthehood> The good ol' Zangief Zucc
[3:50:14] <NPG_Eseph> my dog is hella gay too. he has face and ass fucked several male dogs
[3:50:14] <+pantherminusone> God the model she’s using now looks crazy good. My god how do the number of pixels on those bazonks not decimate the rigging is beyond me.
[3:50:19] <scrumbotime> oh nooo he thought he was getting milk
[3:50:21] <%king_wragles> The two things on Geif's mind: food and dick
[3:50:23] <BooitsDock> aaaaaaaaaaahhhh uuughhhh your dog is a freak
[3:50:27] <+MoroseLoki> Scooby-Dooby Doo
[3:50:31] <TurtlesAndTentacles> your dog sucked off another dog LUL lol
[3:50:32] <ChaosedStar> gief knows what he wants
[3:50:33] <+YayaPup_> OH YOU MEAN THE PEEPEE OF THE GREAT DANE
[3:50:38] <ChaosedStar> what a king
[3:50:40] <%EyeFarted> DIDN'T EVEN BUY HIM DINNER FIRST

[3:50:43] <$NitronStreams> Almost cool
[3:50:48] <$Puhff> LUL
[3:50:48] <Zaktheaussie> Man Zangief can't just be giving it away for free like that
[3:51:00] <+The_Protagonist> Gief was trying to see if the great dane had one shot left
[3:51:01] <+scizor285> God I don't like this map.
[3:51:05] <+Thesaltt> I see that this model sucks ghost dicks just like Pat
[3:51:10] <freelancebabymaker> do we have to
[3:51:10] <eyeobject> doesn't gief also attack pat's balls?
[3:51:17] <%king_wragles> That pallet is HYPER unsafe, just run up the ramp
[3:51:19] <Dymbledore> PFFFFFFFF
[3:51:21] <+pantherminusone> So does peach
[3:51:25] <wolfen091> ballsack fucked
[3:51:34] <@SoFarFetched> Paige dropping pallets doesnt quite work against Nemesis since he can tentacle whip you across the pallet.
[3:51:35] <+TopTieramisu> what kind of noise?
[3:51:39] <%VexicBayn> just show him the monke picture
[3:51:39] <%ItsRatman> OH NO CBT
[3:51:41] <scrumbotime> The Rage Dance Song
[3:51:42] <BooitsDock> why does he attack patts balls
[3:51:45] <%alternative_flu> no matter where pat is he'll just stomp on his nuts
[3:51:46] <postmortempc> Hard not to land on pats junk
[3:51:47] <@SoFarFetched> You'd have to time the pallets just right if he's trying to punch you.
[3:51:55] <+pantherminusone> Pats sub class is CBT
[3:52:00] <President_Pariah> gief is just jealous of pat's balls
[3:52:04] <+CrimKangaroo> yes, that is exactly why we want to know, Paige
[3:52:06] <+Gondab> The threat of a Pallet is enough to juke Nemesis.
[3:52:08] <pretendofriendo> orb
[3:52:08] <+ThatGuyfromMars> does it sound like updog
[3:52:09] <scrumbotime> its it turkey gobbling noises? our bulldog hates turkey noises
[3:52:10] <%ClericOfSparda> ...
[3:52:15] <Prevot> the noise is saying CBT in a high pitch voice
[3:52:17] <freelancebabymaker> the cummer bund
[3:52:19] <OzzySnek> lololol

[3:52:31] <%JoshManVGH> Paige just has a recording of it on her phone for when Pat pisses her off.
[3:52:33] <postmortempc> Isn’t pat technically certified to give cbt?
[3:52:36] <Psyramics> the orb was a torus the whole time?!?!?!
[3:52:36] <Dymbledore> spotted belt
