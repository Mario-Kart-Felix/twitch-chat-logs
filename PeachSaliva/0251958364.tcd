[1:13:31] <%captainthunderwolf> Roofies are tranquilizers.
[1:13:38] <%ToxInjection> "ay yo, George, what is this shit"
[1:13:38] <%captainthunderwolf> Love potions ROB YOUR FUCKING FREE WILL.

[1:14:12] <%AnAsianToaster> hey pat where'd you get your love potion?
[1:14:14] <%Dakuu75> @captainthunderwolf yeah, it's pretty fucked. But, there's a lot of old-school fairy-tail things that, when you really think about it, are super racist or incredibly evil.
[1:14:22] <%lil_potayto> Sounds creepy.
[1:14:25] <@Volta_Bass> "These characters should be friends" George Lucas
[1:14:32] <%TheGershon> I will never understand how that man made the original trilogy
[1:14:35] <%LifesNeverHumDrum> Pat makes sure to slip the potion in the Coconut Water every night before bed
[1:14:40] <%Cynful_Pleasures> So you're saying that the female lead will give birth to Voldamort?
[1:14:43] <%TrevyWeaponsGuy> Pat stop
[1:14:43] <%dotta5> Paige checks burgers for "love potion", not worms
[1:14:44] <%rakhara> No, no, they're not roofies, it's symbolizes a DEEPER MEANING

[1:15:02] <%ziriken> This roofie has a deeper meaning
[1:15:06] <%captainthunderwolf> @rakhara Oh man, there's a deep meaning. And that deep meaning is a really morbid joke.

[1:17:01] <%captainthunderwolf> "Ehlen Payge, I set up the sex scene so that people would see the nude Somali pirates and feel the emotion."
[1:17:03] <%Falilth> he's trying religion to kill you
[1:17:04] <%AnAsianToaster> i kind of can't believe paige is still rambling about this movie
[1:17:08] <@ckbooks> The budget for Strange Magic was $70-100 million and it only grossed $13.6 million.
[1:17:12] <%captainthunderwolf> "Now get naked and sit in the the bahrel."
[1:17:16] <%rakhara> No, no, it's a LOVE POTION
[1:17:18] <%NWR_James> HE'S NOT THE BAD GUY JUST...
[1:17:19] <%Dakuu75> @ssjklyco You mean "Pockets" from the star wars playthrough? I think that's the newest one.
[1:17:19] <%rakhara> totally morally sound
[1:17:25] <%Falilth> pocket sand?
[1:17:25] <@thenefftw> WHAT
[1:17:32] <%Kataguro> What the fuck is this stream
[1:17:33] <@MelBrooksKA> Is this The Ruffie Weapon Hour?
[1:17:38] <%OspreySoul> Why do I get the feeling that, because of Frozen, we're gonna get so many kids movies in the future where the assumed, pretty love interest is ACTUALLY the villain?
[1:17:38] <%TrevyWeaponsGuy> Roofie Sand?
[1:17:39] <%ziriken> Yes
[1:17:40] <%StubYourToe> Pocket ruffie!

[1:18:15] <%lil_potayto> cheer100 Hey Pat. How do you pronounce Chu Chulainn? Also, Paige, are there any characters you like who have names you just find completely unpronounceable? I still have trouble with Saigyouji. As a Japanese speaker, how would you pronounce it actually?
[1:18:19] <%OspreySoul> it's TRUE LOVE
[1:18:19] <%StubYourToe> The patty symbolizes the roofie
[1:18:20] <%ividboy> why does george lucas have a wife

[1:23:49] <%lil_potayto> Woolie totally picked the boss characters. Like, it's the most acknowledged thing ever.
[1:23:51] <%profanityincluded> Rocky Horror Picture show still holds up tho, Tim Curry is a god
[1:23:54] <%JohnElwaysTeeth> he lost to daigo, what a scrub

[1:24:04] <%Keyd00d> DAMN
[1:24:06] <%LifesNeverHumDrum> wow, burn
[1:24:14] <%ssjklyco> How does that make you feel, Pat the Psychologist?
[1:24:20] <%captainthunderwolf> @OspreySoul Remember the fucking faces from Antz?
[1:24:26] <@thenefftw> LP tax is real
[1:24:29] <%dotta5> She said gains
[1:24:29] <@Moobot> Do you have a Fanfiction for Paige to read? Submit it to us here and it may get read on stream! http://bit.ly/2jsxJo9
[1:24:30] <%RaikenTB> don't use that LP excuse
[1:24:34] <%Dakuu75> @ssjklyco that's a really good animation from GooglGareth
[1:24:36] <%tigerfang86> Matt calling out people for the LP tax at pax was LMAO
[1:24:37] <@Volta_Bass> Talking and playing sure is eeeeeaaasy (not)
[1:24:37] <%Yumonikki> LP tax is so damn real
[1:24:38] <%Freelance7> Pat has the max gains
[1:24:39] <%AnAsianToaster> misunderstanding is fun pat
[1:24:39] <%fangdsniper2nd> LP tax is super real man.
[1:24:40] <%krawtch> ive never played SF4 but even i know its not a good idea to employ a strategy that involves eating shoryukens
[1:24:41] <%OspreySoul> One of the heads of Pixar got denied a big promotion when one of the higher ups died in ski accident.
[1:24:42] <%GohanEgret> amazing
[1:24:43] <%rakhara> My god don't even talk about Antz
[1:24:46] <%fangdsniper2nd> It is a legit curse
[1:24:49] <%NWR_James> Scat Game Reviews
[1:24:50] <%tigerfang86> LP tax is super real but I can still laff
[1:24:51] <%Kataguro> Lolli Chopa Chopa your pee pee
[1:24:55] <@ckbooks> Pat is good at games.
[1:24:55] <%ziriken> Liam never has issues
[1:25:06] <%captainthunderwolf> She "used to"
[1:25:06] <%ItsMeUncleEric> I was streaming and 5 people were watching and I lost all skill
[1:25:08] <%tigerfang86> Liam's the rising superstar
[1:25:10] <%lil_potayto> Liam is a golden god though.
[1:25:10] <@thenefftw> That's because Liam is amazing
[1:25:10] <%OspreySoul> So, he ran off to Dreamworks and basically told them all about what Pixar's second CG movie would be.
[1:25:11] <%RaikenTB> LUL
[1:25:11] <%TheOnlyStrayCat> DUDE, I LP. LP TAX IS SO REAL.
[1:25:16] <%Freelance7> Liam died more in TEW 2 than TBFP did
[1:25:17] <%GohanEgret> <3
[1:25:26] <%Dakuu75> @ziriken his issues are on the inside, that's part of why he left the channel. The tax was too high for him
[1:25:27] <%ividboy> Most people dont notice how quiet when they're playing games until they have to talk all the time and say funny things
[1:25:32] <%RaikenTB> Then pay your taxes. Stop Wesley Sniping it
[1:25:36] <%maskedriderhero> So Paige, are you sick of the taste of blood in your mouth yet?
[1:25:36] <%PonyHearts> The LP tax is like a ten percent tax.
[1:25:42] <%Solid_Seth> I believe you Pat. But I do think Matt is bad a games.
[1:25:44] <@thenefftw> THEN STOP EATING IT, PAIGE
[1:25:45] <%ziriken> @Dakuu75 yup. we trade sanity for skills
[1:25:45] <%AnAsianToaster> i buy mcdonalds every day after work
[1:25:53] <%LumberjackJack> NO, I demand MORE VVcDonaalds on stream
[1:25:57] <%Dakuu75> @ziriken Super-true.

[1:26:08] <%LumberjackJack> FUCK. THAT.
[1:26:10] <%Freelance7> Whenever I come home, I get a grilled cheese at In n Out
[1:26:10] <%captainthunderwolf> @Freelance7 To be fair, Liam tried some stupid shit like attempting to normal melee the first enemy in the game to death like six times just to make sure he couldn't.
[1:26:11] <%bbHighvalor> wtf
[1:26:12] <%StubYourToe> no hes right

[1:26:25] <%maskedriderhero> He is super right, they all need to fuck the fuck off
[1:26:33] <%fangdsniper2nd> That shit is the worst and I am so sorry
[1:26:33] <@thenefftw> If that happens again, quit on the spot
[1:26:37] <%ividboy> thats how arson happens
[1:26:37] <%TheGershon> I just got back what did they say?
[1:26:37] <%ssjklyco> One thing you learn doing any profession, when someone tells you something is not hard when they don't do it for a living, don't know what they are talking about until they actually do it and realize the truth.
[1:26:39] <%GohanEgret> paige is obsessed with butt eating
[1:26:39] <%psychodave1234> WELL IF YOU OFFERIN PAIGE Kappa

[1:26:48] <%Admiral_PopnFresh> Quit and then TELL EVERYONE
[1:26:51] <%AnAsianToaster> some things are more important
[1:26:51] <%Jubelaious> Hopfully you make more than minimum wage
[1:26:53] <%RadicalWeegee> ask for a raise if they say no quit
[1:26:53] <%fangdsniper2nd> 70 hours is fucked man
[1:26:57] <%lil_potayto> Sometimes you have to pay the bills.... : (
[1:27:01] <%LifesNeverHumDrum> this story ends in Quit or Arrested For Arson
[1:27:02] <%ToxInjection> AYY
[1:27:07] <%OmegaWeltall> i was in a similar situation and fucking quit, 2 1/2 weeks into the new job and its fuggen great LUL
[1:27:07] <%Intersceptre> I mean if you need 70 hours a week you're obviously slow as fuck. work harder.

[1:27:24] <%AnAsianToaster> well it's easy for me to say i'd quit cause i work mininum wage
[1:27:25] <%maskedriderhero> I worked for three years at Hooters and only got one raise. I asked for another one like two years in and my General Manager said "You will get your raise when you show you care about this job"
[1:27:26] <%GohanEgret> "bust my ass off"

[2:00:29] <%captainthunderwolf> Sans is here, specifically, to prevent the Genocide version of YOU from ending the world.
[2:00:37] <%LordMoonIV> wow get rekt
[2:00:39] <%captainthunderwolf> That's why he's here.
[2:00:46] <%Dakuu75> @johnchikr He just mention that he had been watching videos, in preperation for it but, even STILL. Yes, his skills deserve acknowledgment.

[2:01:17] <%Keyd00d> FACK
[2:01:25] <%captainthunderwolf> Which is why he's so surprised that you turn out to be a nice guy in the Pacifist route.
[2:01:28] <%A1Cartwood> Sans is the jokey Vegeta to Papyrus' Goku
[2:01:29] <%lil_potayto> So my accidental spoiler last week was saying "You feel your sins crawling up your back." without thinking it through after you killed your first enemy. Thanks for letting me stick around to see this follow through to the end. You can do this! Stay determined! cheer100
[2:01:29] <@Calek> honestly with the way this phase is going, this fight is gonna take a while
[2:01:34] <%captainthunderwolf> Because he thought you were Hannibal fucking Lecter.
[2:01:37] <%ThePushaMan> Nah flowey knew
[2:01:37] <%Freelance7> Does he eventually get hit?
[2:01:38] <%StubYourToe> Sans has supersanity
[2:01:43] <%Dakuu75> Quesiton: I heard there's a possible alternate song that can play during this, is that true?

[2:02:24] <%Quack_of_Dawn> Late but I'm right on time
[2:02:24] <@Calek> the best part about this fight, and what makes it doable, is that he does the same moves in the same order every time
[2:02:24] <@MelBrooksKA> Paige is talking crazy talk
[2:02:25] <%captainthunderwolf> CAN I MAKE IT?
[2:02:25] <%Keyd00d> Time to watch this for 3 more hours

[2:03:06] <%fangdsniper2nd> cheer100 Fun fact: his weapons are called Gaster Blasters. Wonder who they're named after? Meh, probably just some nerd
[2:03:07] <%edited156> Rekt
[2:03:07] <%KaiserRolled> lionThrow
[2:03:08] <%Dakuu75> This is why I hated the international version of FFX because they put all those god-damn dark-aeons that cock-block the temples and prevent you from getting necisary items end-game
[2:03:12] <%ToxInjection> You got dunked on :(
[2:03:13] <%ItsNineTen> SOILED IT
[2:03:17] <%lil_potayto> Neat
[2:03:17] <%Dakuu75> -which made me feel like this.
[2:03:18] <%Keyd00d> pat what
[2:03:27] <%lil_potayto> Gaster Blasters.
[2:03:31] <%breakfastmegapowers> Sans is da best
[2:03:35] <%captainthunderwolf> Sans is such a badass.
[2:03:35] <@MelBrooksKA> Oh, nothing comes after thrice, https://en.oxforddictionaries.com/explore/what-comes-after-once-twice-thrice

[2:03:53] <%Kataguro> Snes Nundertale
[2:04:03] <%SvenHolgersson> Sans is lazy
[2:04:04] <@Moobot> We're accepting fanfiction submissions, if you think you have a good one message a mod today!
[2:04:04] <%Freelance7> He just wants to give bad jokes
[2:04:07] <%Solid_Seth> The hero.
[2:04:10] <%xijiy> Sans just doesn't believe he will ever be let go
[2:04:11] <%captainthunderwolf> @MelBrooksKA "Once, twice, thrice, nothing"? Oh, shit. There are no numbers after three!
[2:04:11] <%Kataguro> Sans is apathetic
[2:04:12] <%psychodave1234> no windings? damnit
[2:04:14] <%iamnotaparrot> theyre not trying to clear this today are they?
[2:04:15] <mtgtin> OOOOOF
[2:04:16] <%Scales_Tipper> he just gave up
[2:04:17] <%xijiy> Sans knows that eventually
[2:04:17] <%tigerfang86> F U C K
[2:04:19] <%xijiy> You'll reset
[2:04:24] <%Djinnazz> balls exposed Pat.
[2:04:26] <%Keyd00d> SOILED
[2:04:27] <%GohanEgret> he knows you eventually give into temptation
[2:04:29] <%ItsNineTen> oh god I just realized that sans being able to teleport offscreen is actually you running into alternate timeline sanses
[2:04:30] <%xijiy> So why be happy
[2:04:31] <%SvenHolgersson> San knows you are ruining everything
[2:04:36] <%ToxInjection> He's just tired of trying because shit keeps getting reset over and over.
[2:04:39] <%OspreySoul> He knows you'll just reset the game and start over
[2:04:40] <%KaiserRolled> TIME COP
[2:04:41] <%LordMoonIV> she's on to something
[2:04:42] <%NWR_James> He's Rich Evans
[2:04:45] <%xijiy> Rice evans is Sans Undertale
[2:04:47] <%breakfastmegapowers> Sans knows because he's just THAT guy
[2:04:47] <%ziriken> should get rid of that cbun
[2:04:48] <%Yumonikki> Sans is confirmed Policenaut
[2:04:50] <%GohanEgret> liam
[2:04:50] <@ckbooks> It's pretty implied he's a time cop.
[2:04:52] <%ToxInjection> I believe Liam was.
[2:04:53] <%ziriken> liam
[2:04:54] <%ividboy> they didn't do genocide
[2:04:55] <%Quack_of_Dawn> To quote an old Best Friends meme, he's a time cop
[2:04:57] <%ividboy> right?
[2:04:58] <%Kataguro> They didn't do genocide
[2:05:08] <%psychodave1234> they did pacifist cause the fandom had a hissy fit
[2:05:08] <%reaped_psyche> Because Liam is good at video games.

[2:05:27] <%fangdsniper2nd> Hi Peach!
[2:05:27] <%A1Cartwood> He's Trunks, basically
[2:05:32] <%Keyd00d> That's pretty objective
[2:05:36] <%xijiy> @PeachSaliva Tell pat to wait for the poison to fade before he eats
[2:05:37] <%ToxInjection> It's literally an age thing, these old coots.
[2:05:37] <%shinynewbuttons> Sans Undertale....
[2:05:39] <%SvenHolgersson> Platform better Patrick
[2:05:39] <%LordMoonIV> should we tell her who sans really is?
[2:05:40] <%swordsman70> He beat lingering will in like 2 or 3 atempts
[2:05:40] <%RaikenTB> Matt did poorly on that LP
[2:05:41] <%xijiy> @PeachSaliva Hes wasting a ton of HP
[2:05:42] <%TrevyWeaponsGuy> The LP tax is real
[2:05:42] <%korth367> sorry
[2:05:42] <%babblingcabbage> On a scale of 1 to 10 how pregnant are you right now
[2:05:43] <%OspreySoul> Hey Paige!
[2:05:43] <%HDmexiqtioner> lol what?
[2:05:43] <%ItsNineTen> oh man, we cant talk shit about paige now
[2:05:44] <%Intolerable> Sup, Mustard Grill!
[2:05:44] <%Dakuu75> @PeachSaliva Fan-theories suggest that Sans has connections to a hidden character named "Gaster" who gives Sans his powers and ability to understand "save games" and "resets" etc etc
[2:05:46] <%profanityincluded> your boots hot, yo
[2:05:47] <%th3madness> buy more face steaks
[2:05:52] <%captainthunderwolf> Liam also plays a ton of games even compared to the other dudes.
[2:05:52] <%OspreySoul> Pat the baybeee
[2:05:53] <%LumberjackJack> I thought it was Matt? I remember Matt getting a bit mad on a few of the harder parts
[2:05:54] <%HDmexiqtioner> People are just reaching for stuff now.
[2:05:55] <%breakfastmegapowers> Liam is by FAR the most able across the board
[2:05:56] <%captainthunderwolf> Like.
[2:05:59] <%SuichiTanaka> Pat should really be playing with a controller and not the keyboard
[2:05:59] <%ziriken> @PeachSaliva enjoy the new music. there's some great remixes out there. Hopes and Dreams/SAVE the World is my fave
[2:06:01] <%captainthunderwolf> Liam plays a TON of games.
[2:06:02] <@ckbooks> Buy those cool fantasy boots you retweeted.
[2:06:03] <%StubYourToe> yes
[2:06:06] <%SvenHolgersson> Sans is lazy because he never had to defend aganist someone like Chara before
[2:06:06] <%ssjklyco> I know you didnt mean it that way. Just starting shit
[2:06:09] <%Doctor_Death_Bed> aren't you suppose to be reading donations so the stream doesn't gonon an extra hour
[2:06:10] <%guessingtwo> Hints are hidden in file manipulation about what Sans does
[2:06:15] <%SuppishVillain> no longer need to mod
[2:06:17] <%Keyd00d> Liam's good at games even when doing LPs or streaming
[2:06:22] <%kzkinthemorning> SANS IS NESS
[2:06:22] <%fangdsniper2nd> Or Dad
[2:06:26] <@Calek> Gaster is the royal scientist before Alphys
[2:06:26] <%fangdsniper2nd> Or Sans and Pap
[2:06:29] <@PlagueOfGripes> W. D. Gastor
[2:06:33] <%xijiy> God I hate matpat
[2:06:36] <%psychodave1234> still a better theory than matcrap
[2:06:37] <%captainthunderwolf> Gaster is probably the guy who passed his techniques down to Sans and Papyrus.
[2:06:41] <%ssjklyco> Western Digital Gaster
[2:06:44] <%lil_potayto> cheer100 Pat you're doing really hecking good in this!
[2:06:44] <%captainthunderwolf> Thus the chain of similar techniques.
[2:06:45] <%ziriken> Wing Dings
[2:06:49] <%TrevyWeaponsGuy> Gaster made them, he doesn't look like that though
[2:06:49] <%Kataguro> He's Wing Dings
[2:06:49] <%AbnormalVoid> Wing Dings
[2:06:50] <%AmaniIsYourBoss> W.D = Wing Dings
[2:06:51] <%salty_syd913> wing dings
[2:06:51] <%th3madness> Wing Dings
[2:06:53] <SurvivalShotgun> wingdings
[2:06:53] <%LordMoonIV> Wing Dings
[2:06:53] <%Colehatter> Wing Ding Gaster
[2:06:54] <%StencilOST> Wing Dings
[2:06:55] <%ToxInjection> Wait, is Pat gonna show her getting Dunked On, or is he gonna just use a video or something? I wouldn't think he'd wanna do the fight again.
[2:06:55] <%Keyd00d> Font Bros
[2:06:58] <%HDmexiqtioner> It is that Symbol font
[2:06:59] <%SuppishVillain> wing dings and aster
[2:07:00] <%krawtch> laser heads. hah, yeah, like they aren't just weird beam turkeys
[2:07:03] <%galaxyswirl> kappa1000 kappa100 kappa100 kappa100 kappa100 kappa100 here is a bit of cool knowledge, the reason why sans will only ever fit you in the genocide route is because his special ability, karmidic retribution, causes the soul to be weighed down by the amount of LV you have. so he is truly the weakest to a good person, but is almost unstoppable against someone evil, such as flowey
[2:07:05] <%SvenHolgersson> Remember when they said they just "appeared" one day?
[2:07:06] <%SergeEXE> he speaks in wing dings
[2:07:06] <@Moobot> Do you have a Fanfiction for Paige to read? Submit it to us here and it may get read on stream! http://bit.ly/2jsxJo9
[2:07:06] <%Colehatter> "BEWARE THE MAN WHO SPEAKS IN HANDS"
[2:07:07] <%fangdsniper2nd> Win Dings and Aster are fonts
[2:07:08] <%breakfastmegapowers> My skeleton OC Times New Roman
[2:07:09] <%xijiy> @PeachSaliva Tell pat to wait until poison wears off to heal!
[2:07:13] <%Solid_Seth> He’s currently stuck in the game files.
[2:07:20] <%Freelance7> This is getting me tense
[2:07:20] <%StridentSong> @PeachSaliva WD Gaster stands for WingDings Gaster. His text is all in WingDings
[2:07:22] <%Keyd00d> he do it
[2:07:28] <%AmaniIsYourBoss> So if you mod the game, there's 3 NPCs who tell you about Gaster. He was the royal scientist before Alphys.
[2:07:36] <%iamnotaparrot> wd is wingdings
[2:07:37] <+ElectricEmissary> Win Ding and Aster
[2:07:44] <%ziriken> she's missing all the chat answers
[2:07:51] <%Keyd00d> not even 100 percent of my power
[2:07:52] <%anime_boyz> check twitter for a whacky picture Paige
[2:07:54] <%Colehatter> Gaster speaks in the Wingdings font, which has hand symbols in it
[2:07:58] <%OspreySoul> One of my favorite channels GeekRemix has a great theory about where Undyne the Undying's Determination came from
[2:08:00] <%GeneralSCPatton> Gaster got time-fucked so hard that he was retconned from reality

[2:11:19] <Dragon_Batman> oooh hey I can move
[2:11:19] <%fangdsniper2nd> That was the easy part Homie
[2:11:19] <%Kataguro> He removed himself from reality
[2:11:20] <%SvenHolgersson> Gaster IS in the game
[2:11:21] <%SuichiTanaka> SourPls SourPls SourPls
[2:11:21] <Divryne> Time to die.
[2:11:21] <%krawtch> ew dirty normals.
[2:11:24] <InsomniacPersona> GAster is in the game, its just rng to meet him
[2:11:24] <Elexius> Dunked?
[2:11:24] <zaptar13> Technically he is in the game
[2:11:25] <SafetyBet> MEGALOVANIA so good SourPls
[2:11:27] <%SvenHolgersson> He was the royal scientist
[2:11:27] <%ziriken> Gaster is in the game if you hack the fun level
[2:11:28] <%korth367> something something toby likes to have secrets i guess
[2:11:29] <+skizzuto> she hasn't even seen the bullshit part of the fight yet
[2:11:30] <AlchemiBeast> his invention removed him from time and space
[2:11:31] <$siamesesneeze> Officially Dunked on
[2:11:31] <The_Blumper> what the living hell just happened
[2:11:32] <zaklindo99> welcome to the now 24 hour stream
[2:11:33] <iambqb> Gaster represents the plight of a character who was cut out of the game
[2:11:33] <%DelightfullyDongus> SourPls
[2:11:33] <levitheshark> Okay, mods, that was a smart idea to have sub only until then
[2:11:35] <%captainthunderwolf> Because Toby Fox is a weirdo who put a million hidden details into this game.
[2:11:37] <lotharrio> Gaster removed himself from the game, in his attempt to escape the underground.
[2:11:37] <%galaxyswirl> cause he melted into the time stream
[2:11:38] <SubjectX07x> Ooooh boooy... this boss fight is like, the only reason I even care about Undertale, it's just sooooo GOOD.
[2:11:39] <%profanityincluded> i really should get working on my hardbass remix of this track
[2:11:39] <@Calek> didn't Gaster jump into something and his existence spread across all the timelines or something fantastic like that
[2:11:40] <kingra> Something removed him from reality
[2:11:40] <fakemalegamer> Return of the non subs
[2:11:40] <HarmonyOptional> Pat do you want to tell her about the cool stuff fans found about San's song?
[2:11:41] <buffmurffy> pat stop trying to hit the center, you're just losing more health from poison as he dodges
[2:11:42] <superteamwylie> doesnt gaster have a 3% chance to be in the game?
[2:11:44] <%korth367> the mouse
[2:11:44] <Hawkbone_> Now I can talKJ!
[2:11:44] <Dragon_Batman> I've never seen any of this and this is amazing
[2:11:44] <%ItsNineTen> @ Its implied that an experiment went SO WRONG that he removed himself from existence
[2:11:45] <%AnAsianToaster> gaster only appears if you modify certain values, and his name is wing dings, a symbol font
[2:11:46] <Thirtine> gaster got removed from reality after an experiment with the CORE gone wrong

[2:13:12] <serrishtar> @PeachSaliva he thing is the game isnt actually meta, its a world that coincidentally has weird videogame rules and the player is like an lovecraftian abomination that sans can barely comprehend
[2:13:12] <Benpower236> The horde is unleashed!
[2:13:14] <+FrostedZaibatsu> You can order them with a lettus wrap
[2:13:14] <waterstealer> pat if you can't do the first phase without taking damage it's not worth completing the run
[2:13:15] <%GohanEgret> if that's the case, just buy burgers from the store
[2:13:16] <ErraticPillow> yea lets slow it down so messages take 2 minutes each thats real nice....

[2:13:42] <+niserri> wait what? I want a no bun burger doogWhoa
[2:13:44] <+miscinsanity> someone in sub only was asking about an alternate song for this fight, there is a song on the soundtrack called The Song That Might Play When You Fight Sans but it never actually does lol
[2:13:44] <DrakeSilvos> HIs Magnum Opus
[2:13:45] <CrimsonCore90> what is homestuck!?
[2:13:45] <%AbnormalVoid> SourPls
[2:13:47] <%LifesNeverHumDrum> i forgot it was in homestuck, damn

[2:13:54] <+LazyRabb1t> qt thqt point just buy burger patties and cook em yoiurself
[2:13:54] <+nictron90> It's always used for omnicidal supervillains, so some people theorize that it's Chara's theme, not Sans'
[2:14:01] <%Keyd00d> pat calm down on the platform there
[2:14:02] <UnderpaidBob> seriously though what IS homestuck?
[2:14:03] <yosukecchi> paigelovania
[2:14:05] <iambqb> One of the fan theories is that Megalovania isn't Sans' themes but the players
[2:14:14] <Buzzard42> I mean, it is
[2:14:14] <time_axis> by the way, Matt was on the controls in the Undertale LP, not Liam
[2:14:18] <$autismweaponised> \0/\0/\0/
[2:14:18] <SilentEric> It's Chara's Theme. It's your theme Paige.
[2:14:18] <neveoyeah> megalovania got pulled from homestuck for copyright stuff so this isnt the exact original
[2:14:19] <Ell1ot> doesn't ordering it without a bun make the wrapper all gross with condiments?
[2:14:21] <FuqBoiSlim> epic
[2:14:22] <+AcidicHorizon> Someone explain the name and how this is your theme
[2:14:22] <%Keyd00d> you can do it pat
[2:14:22] <SubjectX07x> Homestuck is... a really really REEEALLY long and confusing thing.

[2:14:42] <TheZombiepope> Megalovania is great but they missed an opportunity to subject you to Spooky Scary Skeletons over and over
[2:14:44] <%AmaniIsYourBoss> Yeah, I backed the fuck down from Homestuck
[2:14:45] <%profanityincluded> Whens Undertale 2 tho
[2:14:45] <%ividboy> Sans has his own theme called "The Song that Might Play when you fight Sans", Megalovania is your theme

[2:17:54] <taritari> it's literally the sins crawling on your back
[2:17:54] <%TechGamer> OH MY FIUCKING GOD
[2:17:54] <ultimaphoenix8804> YES WE CAN
[2:17:54] <%Keyd00d> Sans confirmed for Ghost Rider
[2:17:55] <waterstealer> KARMIC RETRIBUTION
[2:17:57] <@mothmandraws> ppl only pick cockney that basically doesnt exist anymore
[2:17:57] <%TechGamer> PATY UR NUTS
[2:18:00] <stigna1> Ohh, I like that! Karmic Retribution!
[2:18:00] <Bionicghost> stands for what now?
[2:18:01] <smargh1015> i never noticed that and i beat this game
[2:18:04] <@MelBrooksKA> Wait, there's gotta be characters with less fingers, weird number fingers is a staple cartoons
[2:18:04] <%corenovas> what kind of horrible child eats DRY instant noodles
[2:18:05] <$googleygareth> @mothmandraws Scotland also has too many.
[2:18:05] <ToxxyMoxxy> you say thomas the tank engine yet kiryus voice actor voices someone in the japanese dub of that show
[2:18:10] <%TechGamer> Oh well ok nm loil
[2:18:10] <%SvenHolgersson> He only fights Chara
[2:18:11] <CactusChef3> it's Karmic Retribution
[2:18:11] <%psychodave1234> jesus pat
[2:18:12] <OvenMittMaster> I've watched this fight a ton of times and I've NEVER noticed that till now
[2:18:15] <$joylent_blue> sans only plays when he can WIN
[2:18:18] <InsomniacPersona> also Sans is this powerful because he sleeps all throughout the game
[2:18:21] <%fangdsniper2nd> In theory if you kill no one, Sans canonly do 1 damage to you
[2:18:22] <%tigerfang86> the platforming one is the HARDEST ATTACK for everyone
[2:18:23] <%galaxyswirl> @PeachSaliva its karmic retribution
[2:18:25] <%tigerfang86> legit
[2:18:31] <devanmuse> He still has some very BITTER words for you if you kill Papyrus, though... You dirty brother killer
[2:18:33] <+BinaryForest> The poison is fine now because you can wait it out. It's when he starts cheating in the menu that you've got to rush
[2:18:34] <+Mikatonic> what even is health
[2:18:35] <+HannibalBeerus> fucking Pat PLEASE don't spasm during that, you can take it slow with the jumps
[2:18:37] <%Dakuu75> Question: Can you fight sans WITHOUT killing everything and only killing the story characters?
[2:18:39] <+TerryTheTurret> If you spare one it means you're not a COMPLETE monster and there's at least a biiiit of good on you.
[2:18:40] <Graxe_> Pockets is going through her own genocide run.
[2:18:41] <%Kataguro> Heck Yeah
[2:18:41] <buffmurffy> pat for gods sake stop going so crazy on the moving platform, you're taking more damage from falling off than just tanking the hits

[2:18:45] <%rugelachs> Yes
[2:18:49] <MoulesFritz> getting dunked on then going back and doing true pacifist is the objectively correct route
[2:18:49] <%GohanEgret> NO
[2:18:52] <%AnAsianToaster> he only fights you in full genocide
[2:18:59] <%korth367> @Dakuu75 genocide only
[2:19:03] <%Jaxiis0> LOOK AT PAT BEING PRO
[2:19:05] <MainMan_Jonadiah> Don't do it, the boot-stink will distract Pat
[2:19:05] <reonome> SourPls
[2:19:06] <OkamiDude15> @Dakuu75 nope only if you kill everyone
[2:19:07] <$ImasukyLomae> I love your boots and hope you succeed
[2:19:07] <%Jaxiis0> PogChamp
[2:19:08] <WisdomHat> I like when Paige wears her TERRIBLE BOOTS
[2:19:08] <@Moobot> Do you have a Fanfiction for Paige to read? Submit it to us here and it may get read on stream! http://bit.ly/2jsxJo9
[2:19:11] <iambqb> @TerryTheTurret, no it has to be everyone. The dialogue were seeing will get into it, but that's what it takes for him to care
[2:19:12] <Ozmodyas> The implication is that Sans has been minmaxing himself to fight you over multiple timelines
[2:19:14] <$vinadir> do you have to attack him to progress the fight?
[2:19:19] <%korth367> yeah
[2:19:20] <alwayspronking> *lazer beams everywhereSHITS FUCKED

[2:25:56] <topendbuzz> saves
[2:25:57] <Valkyrjsen> Honestly Pat is doing super good. A little bit of practice and he'll be able to do it consistently. Sans' moves are somewhat consistent, like Undyne's.
[2:26:00] <+MajorCrasher> cheer500 Just wanted to say your boots are probably the ugliest boots I've ever seen but I still love watching you and Pat anyway
[2:26:06] <stigna1> Sans does not actually remember stuff; he's just reading your facial expression real well.

[2:26:51] <ape_hawk> she has A big boob
[2:26:53] <$joylent_blue> she IS a big boob

[2:27:49] <%breakfastmegapowers> Sans probably IS Papyrus from another timeline probably- Game Theory
[2:27:51] <%AnAsianToaster> rather he knows it doesn't matter and is all for nothing
[2:27:52] <%RAWKPARTEE> You could watch the game theory on what sans is.
[2:27:54] <+Slattsquatch> People have done no hit runs of this boss
[2:27:55] <%captainthunderwolf> @mothmandraws Goodnight moth! I always enjoy seeing you around the stream.

[2:28:21] <@Moobot> We're accepting fanfiction submissions, if you think you have a good one message a mod today!
[2:28:22] <%Dakuu75> @cereal_box_conspiracy plus he's a "monster" first and "skeleton" second, imo
[2:28:23] <$Agami23> kappa100 hey pat and paige, i tricked my brother into sparing sans because he is a punk and he got so mad he quit for the day and and didn't talk to me for a day and the half.
[2:28:23] <stigna1> Oh, did they see that KR=Karmic Retribution?
[2:28:23] <splicerss> Would y’all eat skeleton ass?
[2:28:25] <Ozmodyas> It's implied Sans worked with Gaster which is where he got his time machine from, Gaster went too far and got erased from existence by time experiments and only exists in the game code now
[2:28:26] <johnthecoolmex> CLUTCH
[2:28:27] <%lil_potayto> DOKI DOKI
[2:28:27] <@thenefftw> No Doki, please
[2:28:28] <BlindGato> DOKIs pretty short
[2:28:29] <ScallyCapt> AGREE
[2:28:29] <%gstut1> DO DOKI DOKI!
[2:28:29] <$Jazzarms> i love text
[2:28:29] <@Calek> Doki Doki is beatable in one stream though
[2:28:31] <Dethhollow> Do Doki Doki
[2:28:31] <lotharrio> cheer100 I think, but I'm not sure, that Gaster removed himself from the game/reality. Basically, hacking himself out of it, either in an attempt to escape the underground, or a result of understanding the nature of his game-reality and refusing to partake in it. Most of his followers/subordinates followed him in removing themselves, save editing lets you meet some of them. Presumably, Sans was the one subordinate that stayed, hence his photo with no one you know in it.
[2:28:31] <Valkyrjsen> Good one Pat PogChamp

[2:30:05] <themightyseptopus> pro tip: during the gaster blasters just stay on the bottom 2 rows it reduces chances of getting stuck
[2:30:08] <taritari> not fucking oyu
[2:30:12] <$low_ver_zealous> Contradiction is a game id like to see you play
[2:30:14] <%LumberjackJack> Undyne
[2:30:14] <%galaxyswirl> sans
[2:30:15] <%AnAsianToaster> he's really not a hero
[2:30:15] <deviljhojho94> paige is always the villian
[2:30:16] <morat2255> Undyne is the True Hero
[2:30:16] <cizal11> the hero was undyne, and she's fucking dead
[2:30:17] <hntronium> THE BOSS
[2:30:19] <Elexius> Wow way to sandbag undyne
[2:30:19] <topendbuzz> NOT SURE???????
[2:30:23] <%AnAsianToaster> he only bothers ti fight after everyone is dead
[2:30:27] <RunningNGunning> The worst part about DDLC is that its a bad VN until it gets good
[2:30:27] <Ssaik> Megalovania is YOUR boss battle theme!
[2:30:31] <$thesounddefense> YOOOO
[2:30:32] <%Kataguro> Pat loves it
[2:30:32] <%AbnormalVoid> NICE
[2:30:32] <%galaxyswirl> he is the HEROIC ANTAGONIST
[2:30:33] <%salty_syd913> NICE
[2:30:33] <Cheapheatmo> NAILED IT
[2:30:34] <%Freelance7> YOOOOO
[2:30:34] <%ToxInjection> PogChamp
[2:30:34] <tomcrimson> SICK
[2:30:35] <%Keyd00d> SICK
[2:30:35] <sounata> nice!!
[2:30:35] <johnthecoolmex> N I C E
[2:30:35] <%KaiserRolled> PogChamp
[2:30:37] <%ThePushaMan> No, undyne is the hero, sans is the wall
[2:30:38] <Pairoschuz> yeyeyeye
[2:30:39] <%krawtch> theres no room left on Paige's back for tattoos, she already has that giant Grimace McNuggies on her back
[2:30:40] <%Jaxiis0> NICE
[2:30:41] <Klefth> The thing is, Sans IS aware of the timelines/save files, but he can't control it like Flowey or Frisk/Chara, hence his fight is always the exact same loop.
[2:30:42] <%SergeEXE> DO ITTTT
[2:30:42] <Silent_Fyraena> Chara has taken over Frisk's body.
[2:30:43] <+Mikatonic> Undyne's the hero. This is a fight beyond that.
[2:30:45] <+trnzero> NAISU
[2:30:47] <%Johnso1o> 0 FUCKING DMG
[2:30:52] <KaiserMario> @PeachSaliva Pat, the reason you are having a lot of trouble, is because you're not concentrating... I'm sorry to say but Paige's might have to stop reading/talking
[2:30:53] <Kipss> ddlc is a mediocre VN turned into a good VN literally just before it turns into another generic horror game
[2:30:56] <SilvanSagevale> SHOW US THE FANART
[2:30:58] <%fangdsniper2nd> Chara did NOTHING wrong. All of these choices are yor own
[2:31:01] <serrishtar> @PeachSaliva where you fall at the beginning of the game is charas grave and his soul latches onto frisk through the flowers
[2:31:02] <DarkKnightGrave> MISSION STATUS: FUCKING SICK
[2:31:03] <%Jaxiis0> DUDE PAT
[2:31:05] <%ziriken> TORIEL DID NOTHING WRONG
[2:31:10] <%Keyd00d> WOW PASS THE BLAME
[2:31:11] <iambqb> This is still Frisk
[2:31:11] <+Jaysky> Undyne was the hero, Sans is the last stand because he knows what happens after.
[2:31:13] <+BinaryForest> "My rampant genocide is Toriel's fault for burying her adopted child"
[2:31:13] <%AnAsianToaster> oh yeah it's toriel, not you for killing everyone
[2:31:14] <zaptar13> It would not stop you
[2:31:16] <%korth367> technically, yes. toriel did everything wrong.
[2:31:17] <@thenefftw> It's all your fault
[2:31:17] <%OspreySoul> It's all the player's fault
[2:31:21] <+TeethMuncher> Toriel fucked up real bad
[2:31:21] <@Moobot> Do you have a Fanfiction for Paige to read? Submit it to us here and it may get read on stream! http://bit.ly/2jsxJo9
[2:31:22] <Spydurman> PAIGE YOU CHOSE THIS RUN
[2:31:22] <+NightOwlSam> what did Paige name the character? Frisk or Chara? i can't remember
[2:31:23] <Thirtine> @captainthunderwolf yeah, if they can get past the suprer generic slice-of-life VN set up
[2:31:24] <%Freelance7> It's your fucking fault
[2:31:24] <MoulesFritz> DDLC should have ended after the first twist
[2:31:26] <stigna1> AHHHH, Hype overLOAD.
[2:31:28] <%krawtch> women passing the blame
[2:31:29] <%OspreySoul> YOU DID THIS PAIGE
[2:31:29] <smargh1015> paige its your fault you chose to do this
[2:31:34] <UnderpaidBob> isn't this like the same as that bloodborne shit where there's only like 1 guy that can't die at once?
[2:31:34] <%TheGershon> I thought Chara is possessing Frisk
[2:31:36] <$joylent_blue> @PeachSaliva because you COULD, you were CURIOUS
[2:31:45] <%GohanEgret> @NightOwlSam chara
[2:31:46] <Benpower236> You didn't need to kill all your friends.
[2:31:48] <42nfl19> Wait what happens if you do the genocide route first?
[2:31:50] <%ToxInjection> which is why when I finally beat Undertale myself, I only did the Neutral and Pacifist Endings, and then never touched it again.
[2:31:50] <%captainthunderwolf> @Kipss A lot of decent work went into making it a weird meta game and that was the clear intent, so I think judging it as a VN basically misses the point.
[2:31:52] <%fangdsniper2nd> @PeachSaliva You can still quit up until aster Asgore
[2:31:53] <%ziriken> Chara is possessing Frisk
[2:31:53] <%OspreySoul> This is payback for Papyrus
[2:31:54] <HarmonyOptional> MEGALOVANIA is YOUR song, Paige
[2:31:57] <%breakfastmegapowers> Chara is basically the main Character of Genocide, Frisk is the main Character of Neutral Pacifist
[2:32:04] <%ToxInjection> but they also call people out that just watch videos of the genocide runs too...
[2:32:05] <SilentEric> W. D. Gaster is Wingdings.
[2:32:05] <+superkeaton> You wanna see the pieces
[2:32:09] <taritari> everyone is lowkey freaked out in routes after this
[2:32:09] <%lil_potayto> You deleted their happy ending and replaced it with a bad one.
[2:32:10] <DantesAnimus> by continuing the game, you become the asshole
[2:32:10] <EmptyFist> Frisk is POSESSED
[2:32:10] <%Dakuu75> Question: there are TWO children, right? Frisk is the BODY you play as... then gets possesed by Chara, correct?
[2:32:12] <+KitkatRai> Peach realize that in almost every fight, you attack first, but in this fight, you don't. Sans does.
[2:32:14] <+khalcipher> i got my happy ending and never play it again and im proud of that
[2:32:14] <emillionghost> Good Job Pat!
[2:32:15] <+Ilpala271> "IT'S ME PAPYRUS" "Aw sonuvabitch!" "It's me, Papyrus! It was me allllll along, Papyrus!"
[2:32:18] <Bionicghost> DO IT NOW
[2:32:22] <+skylerpilot> @PeachSaliva Pat you are talking about YOURSELF
[2:32:22] <Heyestus> Undyne is john conner, Sans is the second T-800
[2:32:24] <Quiet__Viking> thanks!
[2:32:24] <devanmuse> Flowey's story showed that he's actually the same as you. Flowey is the result of this mindset
[2:32:25] <%maskedriderhero> Undyne is the heroic MC who fails and Sans is the super strong comedic relief who normally doesn't get to step up because the hero saves the day
[2:32:26] <mr_slaide> Passing the blame and acting like victims is what too many wymynz do, Paige. :(
[2:32:33] <%OspreySoul> All retribution for the Skeleton Husbando
[2:32:36] <%profanityincluded> Not gonna lie, but if i got Groundhog Day'd long enough i'd probably do the same
[2:32:37] <alwayspronking> @PeachSaliva Fun Theory: Meglovania is YOUR song, because Sans was to lazy to put his song in the game.
[2:32:39] <+sixcubit> @PeachSaliva remember you get infinite healing opportunities when he tries to spare you
[2:32:45] <Zeemod155> Much my face?
[2:32:46] <Ell1ot> munch me face?
[2:32:46] <%Keyd00d> she sure is inviting a lot of BUTT EATING
[2:32:49] <%ssaryn> Waow Paige butchered that shit all to hell.
[2:32:49] <+cvp5127> mangue mon deriere
[2:32:49] <AlexanderEspen> Even my imediate sans bought it
[2:32:52] <Cedarbridge> @PeachSaliva He knows that "what happens after" is you start another run and everything gets erased.
[2:32:52] <%Mornaka> NINE
[2:32:53] <%ssjklyco> Munch me face
[2:32:53] <%Keyd00d> MUNCH ME FACE
[2:32:53] <Klefth> Fesse
[2:32:54] <%A1Cartwood> Excellent
[2:32:55] <StarSkullyman> WHAT IS THAT ACCENT
[2:32:56] <%Remery_> You know people eat ass right?
[2:32:56] <helpmeimafruit> feces
[2:32:56] <deviljhojho94> Its pronounced come tutto il mio trasero
[2:32:57] <Rhonne> she sounded more irish when she said that
[2:32:58] <%captainthunderwolf> @Dakuu75 Something like that, but there's also the twist where it's implied that, by making decisions Chara would make, you retroactively make it so that your character was always possessed by Chara.
[2:32:59] <Buzzard42> MUNCH ME FACE
[2:33:00] <Prevot> Sans is Ultra Instinct Shaggy, the absolute strongest character in all fiction
[2:33:01] <+other_badger> paige shoul;d REALLY play nitw with all this whole-butt-eating
[2:33:01] <%lil_potayto> Pog mo thoin in Irish.
[2:33:02] <TheImmortal70> Eat my butz
[2:33:04] <+SolidusRex> OMELET DU FROMAGE
[2:33:04] <$waltzqueen> Pat the damage you get from the moving bones on the platform cant be as bad as falling into thebpne pile
[2:33:05] <+Mikatonic> oh gosh that an american speaking french
[2:33:11] <%SergeEXE> Butz Klauser

[2:33:14] <+wingblade7> eat da pregnant are
[2:33:19] <%LumberjackJack> @SolidusRex This is the correct answer
[2:33:20] <vivecdidnothingwrong> Munch moi face
[2:33:23] <sassyquatch963> monch me face
[2:33:23] <poweredscoot> Chara did nothing wrong
[2:33:29] <SafetyBet> 9 LUL
[2:33:30] <+TsunamiPoro> come mi culo puta
[2:33:31] <%ziriken> i swore she was going to say "You are going to blow it."
[2:33:35] <%StridentSong> Chara is the most precious child
[2:33:38] <OkamiDude15> @PeachSaliva you just said im gregnante in french Kappa
[2:33:44] <%Solid_Seth> Chara did a lot wrong.
[2:33:46] <clamlamity> !uptime
[2:33:46] <@Moobot> 2h 33m 55s since bed time stories began.
[2:33:49] <%cereal_box_conspiracy> How does a skeleton have eyes?
[2:33:52] <gamewarden92> cheer500 I've heard that if you pick the "I have places to be" ending in pacifist then Sans has a picture of everyone on the surface when you do the genocide run.
[2:33:54] <%ssaryn> Don't worry about that.
[2:33:54] <%OspreySoul> He doesn't need to
[2:33:54] <stigna1> DIRTY BROTHER-KILLER
[2:33:55] <%krawtch> cause papyrus is forgettable
[2:33:55] <+BinaryForest> Has Paige noticed the blue eye when he does crazy shit yet
[2:33:55] <%Keyd00d> He does
[2:33:55] <Thirtine> @TheGershon chara has been hanging around throughout all the runs, since theyr the one's writing all the flavor text, its not quite possesion, but youre/frisk's actions influence charas behavior and convictions once you get to the endings
[2:33:58] <topendbuzz> So before the game came out this fight, that menu shit was way worse.
[2:34:01] <iambqb> He says stuff about Papyrus in the other runs
[2:34:01] <ObsidianDragon86> DIRTY BROTHER KILLER!
[2:34:02] <%captainthunderwolf> Chara's whole deal is that she exclusively did wrong things.
[2:34:02] <cizal11> because if he does his job, papyrus comes back
[2:34:03] <%ziriken> he doesnt care at all Kappa
[2:34:04] <serialtruant> skull are freaky man
[2:34:04] <DefectoRoboto> we will get there
[2:34:08] <reonome> you fucking killed him
[2:34:09] <%maskedriderhero> Pat hasn't gotten far enough in the fight
[2:34:09] <%SvenHolgersson> YOU WILL SEE
[2:34:09] <johnthecoolmex> He knows you don't care about Papyrus
[2:34:10] <Benpower236> He will.
[2:34:12] <suhmguy> What's he gonna say? He's already trying to kill you and it's not like you don't know why
[2:34:12] <MoulesFritz> there are BIGGER PROBLEMS than his dead brother
[2:34:14] <Hawkbone_> @PeachSaliva He doesn't want to acknowledge it.
[2:34:14] <%SergeEXE> Neutral ending variant
[2:34:15] <%bread_assassin> It's about more than just Papyrus, now.
[2:34:16] <%breakfastmegapowers> The game gets RESET so what does it matter?
[2:34:17] <+ElectricEmissary> tell her about dirty brother killer
[2:34:18] <baronvonkame> lmao peach is so focused on papyrus, disregarding the skeelton CURRENTLY STABBING YOU TO DEATH
[2:34:18] <+HannibalBeerus> Its like anything, cut out pikachu's eyes and make him a skeleton and he's basically sans
[2:34:19] <$EyeRChris> Someone should draw Punished Chara Paige and Angriest Pat Sans with demon eyes fighting
[2:34:19] <pectusumbra> yeah, he knows you don't care
[2:34:19] <anar_bael> I mean what is there left to say besides Dirty Brother Killer
[2:34:20] <Spydurman> YOU'LL SEE
[2:34:21] <waterstealer> YOU'LL GET SOME PAPYRUS DIALOGUE
[2:34:22] <@Moobot> We're accepting fanfiction submissions, if you think you have a good one message a mod today!
[2:34:22] <Dektoide> who cares really
[2:34:22] <$lotharrio> He'll mention Papyrus only if you did a neutral run that killed Papyrus. He's also got bigger problems, like the death of all life on earth.
[2:34:24] <%OspreySoul> Everyone knows who killed the Great Papyrus
[2:34:24] <smargh1015> sans doesnt time travel hes just really obsevant
[2:34:25] <%Freelance7> Did you guys know that there's a skeleton in all of us?
[2:34:36] <SilentEric> He doesn't travel anywhere. He just knows about the game and can make assumptions because he is smart.
[2:34:39] <%AnAsianToaster> sans has very little emotion
[2:34:42] <+Valtyrae> Sans is not a traveler, he's just aware of what's happening.
[2:34:46] <SilvanSagevale> He does mention Papyrus if you kill ONLY Papyrus and no one else
[2:34:48] <Kipss> no, theres no implication that chara destroys the universe, as far as I remember. they just kill every single monster, but they seemto have no desire at all going after humanity iirc
[2:34:49] <+Spikyshrike> @PeachSaliva Sans does not travel between reality
[2:34:52] <Valkyrjsen> It's really funny how a normal human skull is Sans' threatening face.
[2:34:54] <+NightOwlSam> chara was a lil shit
[2:34:58] <%OspreySoul> Chara was always twisted
[2:35:06] <$MGKBurrito> Is CHARA a STAND?
[2:35:06] <%profanityincluded> Chara is autistic
[2:35:07] <$tyroso> Sans is Funny Valentine and D4C
[2:35:10] <mothdude> Well that was the plan, to get six souls.
[2:35:10] <+thehoodnick> crazy theory y’all, what if sans undertale..... is ness earthbound???? Just game three
[2:35:10] <%OspreySoul> Chara intentionally poisoned themself
[2:35:11] <%maskedriderhero> A natural born monster
[2:35:11] <%SvenHolgersson> Chara is just a shit kid
[2:35:13] <17sevens> Sans cares in every neutral ending. If Papyrus dies everyone will be upset, but Genocide trumps that, this is more important.
[2:35:13] <42nfl19> So what happens if you do genocide first? They can't reference time travel if you do it first right?
[2:35:15] <Prevot> sometimes people are just assholes
[2:35:18] <+Jaysky> He does care, to a point. He threatened you before you fought Papyrus by the bridge and then disappeared for the entirety of the run until now.
[2:35:21] <%captainthunderwolf> @Kipss Sans outright states that timelines are ending. Not like the monsters are all dying. Like a homicidal god is ending reality.
[2:35:26] <%krawtch> Chara got made fun of in a game of counter-strike 1.6 in a world where bullyhunters doesnt exist
[2:35:26] <%fangdsniper2nd> Chara is an impressionable child that you told "killing is ok"
[2:35:26] <MissMalisin> SourPls SourPls SourPls SourPls
[2:35:27] <@Calek> Chara poisoned themselves to death so Asriel would absorb their soul, bypass the barrier and then kill more humans to start a war @PeachSaliva
[2:35:32] <Elexius> My headcanon is Chara came from an abusive household.
[2:35:32] <%TheGershon> Chara came to the Underground in the first place because he was trying to kill himself. He just doesn't give a fuck
[2:35:34] <UnderpaidBob> chara is an anime villain
[2:35:35] <+SolidusRex> CHARA DID NOTHING WRONG
[2:35:35] <Aydarkzero> Stand Name Wheres the Knife Stand User Chara Kappa
[2:35:36] <MONSTRx_x> chara playing too much violent vidya games
[2:35:37] <StarlightGalactic> So did she find out that WD Gaster is the font Wing Dings?
[2:35:38] <AncelDeLambert> I need to go back and listen to the flower conversations, need the context
[2:35:42] <%TheOnlyStrayCat> cheer1700 It also just struck me, that I NEVER answered your one question on what I write about. There is actually VERY little fanfiction in my works, because my first fanfiction was such a shitshow I swore off it for good. All of my writings are original works, and, of course, all of it's fucking furry filth, much like myself. But also an unhealthy dose of smut.
[2:35:42] <%maskedriderhero> @42nfl19 If you do genocide first it fucks up every run afterwards
[2:35:43] <Dragon_Batman> It's the implication that the human world is filled with assholes and kinda sucks. that's what I grasped from the talk with Asriel before leaving
[2:35:44] <kingra> HEAL DAMMIT
[2:35:44] <%breakfastmegapowers> Sans basically only cares about stopping you from winning because if you RESET then there's no problem with Papyrus or anyone else
[2:35:45] <Cedarbridge> CHARA DID NOTHING WRONG
[2:35:45] <TheNeedlesD> So wait, how many years has passed if Chara fell down in 201X
[2:35:47] <CrematedCube> Chara hated people from the start, ran away from the human world
[2:35:48] <%OspreySoul> I think both the fallen children left abusive homes
[2:35:49] <%lil_potayto> cheer100 Paige, the expression 'Eat my ass' in Irish is "Pog mo thoin" (Poh-g muh hoh-n). Fun fact: in the Wire, the two alcoholic Irish detectives in the first season are called agents Pog and Mahón which when combined makes a crude little bit of wordplay.
[2:35:51] <%profanityincluded> FUCK Anti-inflammatory diets
[2:35:51] <%ividboy> 1 HP AND A DREAM
[2:35:52] <$waltzqueen> @PeachSaliva No one climbs Mt Ebott for happy reasons. Imagine the worst things the world can do to a child, then make the child mad that it happened. This is the common assumption about what happened to chara.
[2:36:00] <+miscinsanity> @Valkyrjsen that's cos humans are descended from skeletons
[2:36:02] <ghost_teeth> CHARA came to the mountain to kill themself, even though they're a little kid. Kinda gives you a hint to why he hates people
[2:36:04] <+thesw1tch> @thehoodnick there is an earthbound 3. it's awesome
[2:36:04] <%OspreySoul> Asriel even implies that with Frisk
[2:36:05] <%Keyd00d> PAT
[2:36:07] <AussieYak> NotLikeThis
[2:36:08] <DantesAnimus> Or glass
[2:36:08] <taritari> Chara was such a shit that I always thought that when they accidentally got Asgore sick with the buttercups the first time that he knew what he was doing
[2:36:12] <missingangle> god Pat gets fucked over so bad with that one, jesus
[2:36:12] <zaklindo99> nice job fuckboivin
[2:36:13] <@Moobot> YOU'RE BEING TOO LOUD! (jisang0415) (warning)
[2:36:19] <Thirtine> childhood abuse/neglect maybe??, asriel did say that chara brobably went to mt ebott to kill themselves/ ":disappear" @PeachSaliva
[2:36:19] <%profanityincluded> I KNOW PEACH, I GOT CHRONS DISEASE
[2:36:20] <KaiserMario> I'm teeling you, he needs to focus
[2:36:22] <+LtShuckle> \o/
[2:36:23] <hntronium> YOU FUCKING DID IT PAT
[2:36:23] <+other_badger> mcdonalds is antiinflammatory!?!
[2:36:25] <Hydrapissed> Got ra maybe I should lay off bread
[2:36:28] <%Gogogolem> I'll anti inflamatory that ass!
[2:36:32] <spacey_cowgirl> Thanks Paige :)
[2:36:35] <%Solid_Seth> Yes the child that wanted to kill humans did nothing wrong.
[2:36:35] <%Dakuu75> She doesn't have Chrone's Disease, does she?
[2:36:38] <+TerryTheTurret> @Kipss The mention in the pacifist run that he wanted to kill humanity when he fused with Asriel, but Asriel stopped them and that's why they died.
[2:36:38] <vivecdidnothingwrong> Bread mAKES YOU FAT?
[2:36:42] <$joylent_blue> chara is canonically a girl
[2:36:43] <@Calek> @Dakuu75 lupus
[2:36:46] <$Mrdoctorprofessorhipster> Moobot got a lot more active once the chat became public
[2:36:54] <%OspreySoul> Chara's a girl?
[2:36:54] <+skizzuto> my mom has celiac and irritable bowel syndrome, her diet is depressing af
[2:36:55] <+FrostedZaibatsu> Shout out to Gucci Mang
[2:36:56] <%Dakuu75> @Calek it's never lupis
[2:36:58] <Ell1ot> we see you eat it all the time!
[2:37:02] <%OspreySoul> I thought both the kids were gender neutral?
[2:37:03] <+NightOwlSam> it's all those worms, paige. they're buggin ya
[2:37:04] <@Calek> @Dakuu75 well you say that
[2:37:05] <CrimsonCore90> occasionally?!
[2:37:05] <$rdark_ksu> I should eat anti inflammatory but I want my food to take like literal lava
[2:37:07] <SilvanSagevale> IS THIS MONSTER HUNTER!?
[2:37:08] <%ssaryn> McDonalds might as well be Nega-Inflammatory
[2:37:08] <devanmuse> The "Chara narrator" thing is just a fan theory, though, not confirmed. Just as valid is the "Frisk is literally Chara's corpse from the beginning" since the first item they start with is a BANDAGE, and Chara was MUMMIFIED in the coffin
[2:37:09] <%fangdsniper2nd> cheer100 All Chara wanted was for everyone to be free. YOU chose this path. The blood is on your hands. Chara is just your knife.
[2:37:12] <DrakeSilvos> Eh I stick with fish for my inflammation.
[2:37:12] <Benpower236> You're guilty every god damn day!
[2:37:15] <+HannibalBeerus> If bread made you fat I'd actually gain some fucking weight

[2:37:23] <JM_FUNK> fast food is salty as fuck. salt = inflammation.
[2:37:24] <@Moobot> Do you have a Fanfiction for Paige to read? Submit it to us here and it may get read on stream! http://bit.ly/2jsxJo9
[2:37:27] <%StridentSong> cheer1000 Literally because I like having that GOLD badge.
[2:37:28] <+Jaysky> Technically, yes SilvanSagevale
[2:37:29] <Magnetgear> lets see how far this time
[2:37:36] <tmacdiggs> You could say Frisk and Chara are...Soulmates

[2:37:47] <ImperfectWeapons> Bitch, you got Krones? My mother's a kronie.
[2:37:48] <+wingblade7> @peachsaliva does anti-inflammatory diets help with the baby?
[2:37:56] <OkamiDude15> @Buzzard42 yes he let paige do it
[2:37:57] <%AnAsianToaster> man there's salt in everything
[2:37:57] <%profanityincluded> Salt is super bad for intestinal infections
[2:38:00] <+BJLE> Aww pat is playing. Thats not why im here
[2:38:04] <%ziriken> @StridentSong @TheOnlyStrayCat fight
[2:38:14] <MissMalisin> SourPls SourPls SourPls
[2:38:26] <+thehoodnick> Sodium inflates, its why people can’t get rings off a lot
[2:38:27] <@thenefftw> Sans. SANS is an asshole?
[2:38:29] <%OspreySoul> Paige would DIE
[2:38:29] <%Gogogolem> Wheres the bathroom, where are my pants, i didn't know she was a prostitute. Important phrases to learn.
[2:38:30] <+PeaceCentennial> @TheOnlyStrayCat wow you gonna just TAKE THAT LYING DOWN?
[2:38:35] <Thirtine> Sans is COMPLETELY JUSTIFIED in being an asshole to you
[2:38:35] <MainMan_Jonadiah> "Felt like a turning point." Huh, never seen that one.
[2:38:35] <Klefth> They're not random
[2:38:38] <%Keyd00d> Paige is incapable of beating Sans
[2:38:39] <Nixonesque> just got here, i assume pat already showed off sans "sparing" you?
[2:38:40] <cj_art> you'd be here forever if paige was playing lmao
[2:38:40] <%TheOnlyStrayCat> cheer1000 Strident, you underestimate my resolve.
[2:38:41] <%captainthunderwolf> Salt is bad for certain conditions, but normal people can eat pretty much as much salt as they want, because excess salt leaves the body through urine almost immediately.
[2:38:45] <spacey_cowgirl> It’s been hard and I only started the diet a few days ago. I hope I get used to it
[2:38:45] <$joylent_blue> @OspreySoul flowey refers to chara as she
[2:38:46] <+spacehouse> cheer100 Heard other ppl recommend LISA to play after this, why not LISA?. Or u can do ICONOCLASTS, thats a newer one.

[2:38:57] <+Skatedeandre> You think Paige would be able to do this? LUL
[2:38:57] <@thenefftw> @PeachSaliva Really, Paige? SANS is the asshole here?
[2:38:58] <Mittensbro> @PeachSaliva Since you're reading chat, have either you or Pat watched Darling in the Franxx? Didn't know that shit was ACTUALLY FATANTASTIC until just about yesterday
[2:39:00] <time_axis> Does Pat know there's no reason to aim for the middle when attacking
[2:39:00] <Dragon_Batman> She still seems to feel all the impact either way which is what matters more.
[2:39:01] <%fangdsniper2nd> idk man.. monies and typewriters
[2:39:14] <%Solid_Seth> You could also play OFF.
[2:39:21] <%captainthunderwolf> Oh man, OFF.
[2:39:23] <stigna1> Man, this is fantastic.
[2:39:25] <%OspreySoul> I'd love to see her play Doki Doki
[2:39:26] <%captainthunderwolf> That'd be a great game!
[2:39:26] <@MelBrooksKA> Learn how to ride trains
[2:39:28] <SilvanSagevale> There are many theories for why Chara wanted to kill the humans but most agree they wanted to help the Monsters
[2:39:29] <gypsystranger> @peachsaliva he does care that you killed papyrus, when he spares you he kills you the same way you killed papyrus
[2:39:31] <FinchBot> i remember OFF

[2:42:57] <@thenefftw> @PeachSaliva Paige, you've murdered everyone you've ever met n the Underground, acted like a complete psycho, and loves killing. Sans is a little justified in everything he's doing.
[2:42:59] <OkamiDude15> VoHiYo <3 lilyWeeb
[2:43:00] <%galaxyswirl> @PeachSaliva another interesting fact, did you know that the 2 colors sans' eyes change to are the colors for justice and integrity
[2:43:12] <%StridentSong> cheer1500 Not sorry Paige. But clearly someone needs to learn a lesson.
[2:43:17] <Silent_Fyraena> I keep thinking my donation was missed, but then a donation mentions Undyne... :P

[2:43:24] <%ividboy> @Wistelligence BibleThump *hugs*
[2:43:25] <@Moobot> Do you have a Fanfiction for Paige to read? Submit it to us here and it may get read on stream! http://bit.ly/2jsxJo9
[2:43:58] <suikudo> What was that about pat dying
[2:43:59] <Idon__> Go to magfest to kill Pat Kappa
[2:43:59] <%edited156> I wish I could go.
[2:44:02] <%KaiserRolled> dont die pat BibleThump
[2:44:02] <SchroedingersFerret> So Tara strong is apparently an anti-vaxxer
[2:44:05] <Thirtine> @PeachSaliva man, its a good thing that Toby changed the menu bones so that they couldnt just kill you outright LUL
[2:44:06] <taritari> Paige only breaks her leg, but Pat straight up dies?
[2:44:11] <superteamwylie> i think the death message in this fight should be angry townspeople
[2:44:14] <%fangdsniper2nd> I love this bit war going on here
[2:44:15] <%rugelachs> naww
[2:44:16] <%ssjklyco> Wait, did paige break her leg killing pat?
[2:44:16] <Everpresent_Overseer> Remeber Pat hates getting shot
[2:44:18] <%HDmexiqtioner> But what about Combo Con?
[2:44:20] <%HotBloodedHero> MAGFest is just a party con.
[2:44:20] <%OspreySoul> I always imagine Sans as Patrick from Spongebob.
[2:44:22] <MissMalisin> SourPls SourPls SourPls SourPls
[2:44:22] <pectusumbra> awwww man, missed the 10 one
[2:44:22] <MONSTRx_x> Pat is sans
[2:44:23] <helpmeimafruit> joel's papyrus is the best
[2:44:23] <%LordMoonIV> much better sans out there
[2:44:25] <MainMan_Jonadiah> Matt's Sans voice is pretty good
[2:44:27] <+Antoids> cr1tikal is the canon sans
[2:44:28] <+konodi0da> cr1tikal
[2:44:28] <$joylent_blue> idk Barry from game grumps has a great sans voice
[2:44:28] <Valkyrjsen> Pat is Sans Undertales? PogChamp
[2:44:29] <%GohanEgret> F
[2:44:30] <+SolidusRex> Joel has a good one.
[2:44:30] <%LumberjackJack> I like to imagine Sans as Cr1tical
[2:44:30] <vivecdidnothingwrong> Pat is Sans?
[2:44:31] <+KitkatRai> cheer250 Paige, realize that in the entire game, you've always attacked first, but in this fight, Sans does, also Undyne said she could never land a hit on Asgore, so when you fight him in Neutral, he LETS you hit him
[2:44:31] <%ividboy> very sad
[2:44:31] <Tisaric> critikal voice is pretty good for sans
[2:44:35] <%ThePushaMan> F
[2:44:37] <%edited156> best Sans is cr1tikal
[2:44:37] <DagetSparrow> F
[2:44:38] <+TsunamiPoro> pat you cant die what about the gregnancy
[2:44:39] <+thesw1tch> way to sandbag your gf's love pat
[2:44:39] <serialtruant> Nuance? Sans knows paige killed pat's run with the controller
[2:44:40] <%TheOnlyStrayCat> cheer1000 I guessed two tries on Undyne, I was right. I think I deserve the gold.
[2:44:44] <hntronium> Pat is Sans
[2:44:45] <+other_badger> seconding cr1tikal as canon sans voice
[2:44:45] <%galaxyswirl> sorry i mean patience, dang im dumb
[2:44:49] <%LordMoonIV> yes, best papyrus
[2:44:49] <Ell1ot> I liked your "Get Smoked" hat, Paige
[2:44:49] <Smokay17> I liked Barry from Game Grump's voice
[2:44:54] <%ssjklyco> I would imagine that she would keep Pats skeleton around for "reasons"
[2:44:54] <+miscinsanity> best sans voice is brad neely's Baby Cakes voice
[2:44:56] <+QuadraticGravity> I think Sans sounds like Hangover Woolie
[2:44:57] <Benpower236> Matt has a good Sans voice because he is Sans.
[2:44:57] <HypemasterMonty> The Pizza, Sans
[2:44:57] <levitheshark> Nyeh!
[2:44:58] <$rdark_ksu> @PeachSaliva Ross from game frumps did a great papyrus
[2:44:59] <Klefth> Matt is basically Sans, Paige.
[2:45:01] <%OspreySoul> Paige is best Undyne
[2:45:02] <DarkKnightGrave> That would be Joel.
[2:45:05] <stigna1> Peach does a good Undyne.
[2:45:06] <+BinaryForest> Paige is the best Undyne tbh
[2:45:09] <%LumberjackJack> Paige is Undyne, to be honest :P
[2:45:09] <+trnzero> Cry has a good, non-Skeletor Papyrus voice
[2:45:10] <%StubYourToe> Paige is a great undyne
[2:45:10] <$googleygareth> Vinny is really good at papyrus
[2:45:11] <%StridentSong> cheer1000 If you keep fighting me like this StrayCat... you're gonna have a bad time.
[2:45:11] <%Kataguro> Joel is a damn good Undyne
[2:45:12] <missingangle> Not really. New best Undyne is Paige, though, hands down
[2:45:12] <+skizzuto> your Undyne is spot-on
[2:45:13] <102hk> Yeah!@
[2:45:15] <@thenefftw> Paige is the best Undyne
[2:45:15] <%OspreySoul> "Is this the Krusty Krab?" "No, this is Sans."
[2:45:17] <Cedarbridge> I always hear Sans in my head as Crit1kal or SSeth
[2:45:18] <alex_id> Paige's Undyne is great.
[2:45:18] <+AXL808> Paige was great Undyne!
[2:45:19] <%ziriken> Ross's papyrus sucks
[2:45:20] <%Quack_of_Dawn> Jerma had the best Mettaton voice
[2:45:20] <%lil_potayto> "Pat died. It's sad. Go to MagFest."
[2:45:20] <sangi53> dodger had amazing voices in her undertale LP, she's fucking amazing
[2:45:21] <%ziriken> i hate it
[2:45:21] <%tigerfang86> @PeachSaliva Pat's the best Alphys Kappa
[2:45:23] <cizal11> he isn't skeletor though. they all make noises when they talk his doesn't sound anything like skeletor people only say he does because he's a ridiculous skeleton.
[2:45:23] <OkamiDude15> cr1tikal's got a pretty good sans voice
[2:45:25] <turf_wind_and_fire> Legitimately Ross from Game Grumps does a great Papyrus
[2:45:25] <%fangdsniper2nd> Nowacking has a really good Undyne but your is super good too
[2:45:27] <iambqb> There's a fan animation of the Undying fight I remember it having a good Undyne
[2:45:31] <+honorable_captain_garlock> pat stop humming
[2:45:31] <+KSabot> Dodger had a good undyne

[2:45:40] <SwiftFission> yeah cr1tikal's is good.
[2:45:41] <$thesounddefense> @turf_wind_and_fire Ross is my canon Papyrus
[2:45:42] <DrakeSilvos> No one can best Pat's Alphys.
[2:45:43] <%krawtch> Paige is fish lady
[2:45:43] <LORDSPOOKLEKINS> L-lewd
[2:45:44] <Basch71> Probably Dyrus for Sans since he always sounds tired as fuck
[2:45:44] <PrinceandDragon> You could check out the Undertale Musical. They got a good Undyne in that.
[2:45:45] <%xVivicaa> Love your Undyne!
[2:45:46] <%SergeEXE> i am not a fan of dodgers
[2:45:46] <Damashi_The_Kaotic> I love Ross' Papyrus voice
[2:45:48] <Silent_Fyraena> I thought the girl doing Undyne's bits in the 'Fishy Love' music video was good.
[2:45:49] <theSoberSoldier> Paige is LITERALLY THE BEST Undyne
[2:45:50] <sassyquatch963> thought she wishes she was fucking papyrus, eyyy

[2:46:00] <grilledcheesee1> Cr1tikal <3

[2:46:04] <AgadezXX> making food? I don't believe you.
[2:46:04] <wsintai> No, PLAGUE OF GRIPES is the best Alphys

[2:46:08] <@MelBrooksKA> Plague is best alphys
[2:46:13] <%ssjklyco> Pats normal voice is true Alphys
[2:46:13] <@ckbooks> Paige loves punching vegetables at full force.
[2:46:13] <Elexius> "I love having it spray everywhere"
[2:46:13] <%breakfastmegapowers> I wonder if Undertale could be translated to a animated series well...
[2:46:17] <%ToxInjection> Dodger does a great voice for one of the characters. I forgot which though.
[2:46:19] <+LiveStreamOnyx> PAT BEST ALPHYS doodGood FortOne
[2:46:22] <taritari> I got so thrown off when I heard Alphys in one of the musicals and she wasn't Pat's dumb "Southern" accemt

[2:46:33] <Triplicat> are you talking about lara
[2:46:33] <%Quack_of_Dawn> Jerma's run had some good voices, especially Mettaton
[2:46:35] <%profanityincluded> YOU WILL BLUE YOURSELF Kreygasm ?
[2:46:35] <+FrostedZaibatsu> I think Samuel L Jackson would have a good Undyne voice

[2:46:46] <%LumberjackJack> But Paige, you'll end up destorying the instrument!
[2:46:48] <ape_hawk> maybe the evil clone of dodger?

[2:47:11] <alwayspronking> Dodger's journey through this fight took 8 hours

[2:47:15] <deviljhojho94> Underground holocaust now

[2:47:18] <+skizzuto> god Undertale the Musical is fucking fantastic

[2:47:31] <+micalica> Pat, stay determined!

[2:47:43] <levitheshark> @PeachSaliva Have you heard the cover Dodger did for "Beneath the Mask" for Persona 5?
[2:47:45] <+BioHunter> its not sans theme... its urs
[2:47:46] <$joylent_blue> its supposed to be Chara's boss theme
[2:47:48] <HypemasterMonty> Technically, this isn't really Sans theme though, Sans has his own theme hidden in the files. This is actually YOUR theme, its called Megalovania for a reason.
[2:47:48] <EASrake> This is your song
[2:47:50] <%Mitchwwk> cheer100 Hey guys, just wanted to thank you guys for keeping me sane these last couple months while I search for a new job.

[2:49:28] <%lil_potayto> IT
[2:49:33] <Thirtine> @Valkyrjsen megalovania as a theme has been used for the sociopathic/hardcore evil characters in other media Toby was involved in, so its fore fitting for chara than sans. also there is a track in the game that is titled "song that might play when you fight sans" that is never used in-game
[2:49:43] <deviljhojho94> The real battle begins
[2:49:50] <$magikestral> cheer200 congrats on getting to Sans today! Question of the day: was that papyrus attacking you and freezing you, or was Sans just giving a hand to his best bro?
[2:49:56] <%ividboy> 1 HP AND A DREAM
[2:49:58] <levitheshark> Isn't the quiche is a healing item?
[2:50:00] <%salty_syd913> ooohh nivr
[2:50:03] <%salty_syd913> nice
[2:50:06] <%edited156> whew mate
[2:50:07] <Zeikier> did you get the Noodles?
[2:50:08] <%BoboDaHobo> The butt clench
[2:50:08] <$joylent_blue> @PeachSaliva in case you didnt see us saying earlier, Megalovania is supposed to be Chara's theme, because Sans is really the hero at this point
[2:50:10] <%ItsMeUncleEric> apatBig
[2:50:11] <Cheapheatmo> Wait which homestuck flash is megalovania used for?
[2:50:17] <samoorai> Stay determined Pat
[2:50:18] <Elexius> BONE-us powers ")
[2:50:22] <%Johnso1o> @Cheapheatmo Make Her Pay i think
[2:50:25] <+micalica> notice how the hand attacks are gradually slowing down as he uses them
[2:50:27] <PrinceandDragon> It's used as Vriska's theme.
[2:50:27] <Kipss> i think the one where Vriska gets revenge
[2:50:31] <+Jaysky> The wall move messed me up when it becomes faster
[2:50:32] <devanmuse> It's [s] Rise actually
[2:50:36] <%Johnso1o> is it?
[2:50:37] <%Johnso1o> huh
[2:50:39] <%Johnso1o> its been a while
[2:50:40] <%SvenHolgersson> I love them both
[2:50:43] <Valkyrjsen> @Thirtine Ohh that's true! I know of that song, it's pretty upbeat compared to Megalovania. It all makes sense now. pvpS
[2:50:43] <stigna1> I love ALL of them!
[2:50:45] <%LumberjackJack> Papyrus is BAE Kreygasm
[2:50:49] <%breakfastmegapowers> Skeleton Bros are the best PERIOD
[2:50:51] <taritari> oh on the Real Knife and The Locket, those are the exact same items you find in Pacifist/Neutral, but Chara sees them differently than Frisk does.
[2:50:54] <MainMan_Jonadiah> "I still like Papyrus" "You fuckin' bitch!"
[2:50:55] <+ThatGuyfromMars> papyrus is best boy
[2:50:55] <sassyquatch963> i like the guitar solo from the homestuck version
[2:50:57] <Basch71> of course its Vriska's track
[2:50:58] <iambqb> How much does Pat appreciate a viallain that knows he has to CHEAT to win
[2:51:00] <SodiumChloride2Tough> I remember in a older version of the game Sans could kill you in the battle menu. Now he can only drop you to 1hp instead.
[2:51:05] <HypemasterMonty> You gotta learn how to 8 dodge for that one
[2:51:10] <%Keyd00d> you really gotta find the groove of that one
[2:51:10] <%Mornaka> @PeachSaliva tiny circles for that one pat
[2:51:12] <%SvenHolgersson> Pat you gotta do circles at that part
[2:51:17] <%TrevyWeaponsGuy> Don't yell at the baby
[2:51:19] <%DelightfullyDongus> sipsipElmo dont scare the baby
[2:51:20] <+BinaryForest> The bone ladder is easier if you stay in the middle and move up and down in circles
[2:51:25] <time_axis> for the bones that come in from both sides, you want to be in the middle and do circles
[2:51:28] <+honorable_captain_garlock> Pat move in a circle when the bars come down
[2:51:29] <Silent_Fyraena> The one where the bones go up and down on the elft is easier if you stay in the middle and move in circles.
[2:51:31] <buffmurffy> gotta learn to dodge in an oblong oval at a 45 degree angle
[2:51:33] <missingangle> Are we getting near the end?
[2:51:33] <%Kataguro> H-hayai
[2:51:34] <%tigerfang86> SPEEDING UP
[2:51:37] <%ssaryn> It's genuinely difficult to come back from a lot of his shit after a good 75% through the fight.

[2:56:50] <alwayspronking> Sans' song is on the OST, but not in game.
[2:56:56] <Spydurman> Meglovania isn't for you, it's to keep Sans determined
[2:56:58] <%yeeyeyee> there's literally a song on the OST that's called Sans' battle theme and it's not megalovania
[2:57:00] <stigna1> Sans has a battle theme that never plays; "Song that may play when you fight Sans."

[2:57:15] <%yeeyeyee> megalovania is historically, for toby fox, reserved for the most heinous villains
[2:57:17] <pabloelenano2> @PeachSaliva as a curiosity tobbt fox gift a coppy of his game to the pope

[2:57:30] <+0samura1> Those boots look like 2 burlap sacks tied up with extension cords
[2:57:32] <Arclight2879> Looks like I'm going to have to pull some O.T. to get her a pair.
[2:57:32] <%lil_potayto> Steak in the Shape of Mettaton's Face is a better investment than the boots. Seriously, they're sooo worth it this late in the game.
[2:57:35] <$ScrapSentinel> @PeachSaliva San's theme is called "the song that might play when you fight sans" and is part of the official OST despite never being used in game
[2:57:39] <$joylent_blue> because YOU don't technically fight Sans, Chara does
[2:57:39] <Personified134> Toby fox isn't autistic enough to give this game to the pope, that was the Game Theory guy

[3:12:39] <%krawtch> Paige personally recommended that my job be outsourced to Uzbekistan
[3:12:41] <%ssjklyco> Toys R Us people need jobs more right now.
[3:12:42] <KaiserMario> @PeachSaliva The real reason to do this is, you can't really call yourself a good person if you don't know the consequences and how it feels to be this bad. It's easy to be good when all you get rewarded for it at the end, this has no rewards, only sadness
[3:12:42] <%captainthunderwolf> @Kataguro That's Jim definitely, yeah.
[3:12:52] <%spacehouse> TPP passed, gonna be less jobs for Murican viewers

[3:19:05] <TheImmortal70> @Peachsaliva Hey Pat, if you're fine with it, a good tip for this fight is to jump before crossing that last bone line. The attack will end before you land into the bone pit

[3:21:14] <+Hamblasto> I would go to a con to touch his bag

[3:25:10] <$KitkatRai> @OranHexthief To be fair, you'd just keep going until you beat him, since he only has 1 health, so nothing else would be hard

[3:26:03] <damienlunas> Oh, Paige should have mentioned that restriction earlier.
[3:26:06] <buffmurffy> but what if i use a fleshlight?

[3:26:09] <%psychodave1234> dont tell me what i can and cant cum to, paige. ill do what i want

[3:26:10] <%Yumonikki> "You can fuck to us." - Paige, 2018
[3:26:15] <%ToxInjection> It was something totally different
[3:26:15] <%Colehatter> dammit I just donated to say that
[3:26:16] <%WillowMelody> No, it's a sped up version of his theme.
[3:26:16] <%ividboy> it wasnt this
[3:26:17] <%AbnormalVoid> @TrevyWeaponsGuy whew, that's some weird trivia, right there
[3:26:18] <AlchemiBeast> it sure wasnt
[3:26:19] <%swordsman70> I wouldn't have fought him if it did
[3:26:20] <+CluelessSniper> It was a remixed version of the sans theme
[3:26:21] <Nixonesque> it was a weird mega man sounding theme
[3:26:23] <Sokumotanaka> Awww man I was watching D&D I missed paige's reaction to sans
[3:26:24] <AncelDeLambert> that's an interesting standard
[3:26:25] <%profanityincluded> People dont believe Anne Frank's weird puberty writings? do yall not remember the 5-child orgy in Stephen King's "It" either?
[3:26:26] <DemonicCipher> @PeachSaliva YOURE NOT WAERING SHOES we can see the shape of your feets you cant stop me from jeping
[3:26:26] <%fangdsniper2nd> It was not but it is super good
[3:26:27] <topendbuzz> it was not this
[3:26:29] <DrakeSilvos> it was a red herring.
[3:26:29] <SociallyAwkwardToaster> It 100% is NOT this song, that's the joke @PeachSaliva
[3:26:30] <$TheSniperJoe> I mean...I got to at least second base once during one of these streams...
[3:26:31] <%AmaniIsYourBoss> It was a song that used the Megaman X soundfont, was pretty dope
[3:26:31] <%krawtch> that song that might play sounds like a megaman x3 abortion
[3:26:37] <Ravenwingg> The regulation regarding masturbation comes after talking about boobs for several minutes
[3:26:38] <%TrevyWeaponsGuy> @AbnormalVoid They definitely left that one out of the grade school lessons
[3:26:39] <+ThePayphone> oof
[3:26:42] <Arktonyel> I believe it was a Megaman X song
[3:26:43] <iambqb> It's part of the reason people think Megalovania isn't Sans' song
[3:26:44] <$lotharrio> Paige, in charge of distracting Pat as he tries to beat the Woolie style boss-character.
[3:26:44] <%AbnormalVoid> "You can fuck to us" to the tune of "You can run with us"
[3:26:47] <%SaltyDongs> Nice on
[3:26:53] <+Ninestempest> @PeachSaliva "The song that might play when you fight Sans" is in the OST and it's a 50 second song that's a really weirdo remix of this song and not nearly as good.
[3:26:53] <%SaltyDongs> one
[3:26:53] <%AbnormalVoid> @TrevyWeaponsGuy hahaha, no kidding
[3:26:56] <@PlagueOfGripes> you should open every stream by telling the camera "You can fuck to THIS"
[3:26:59] <serialtruant> 1.800 people fucking to undertale genocide RIGHT NOW
[3:27:01] <SenranKaguraWeeb> This song Isn't sans song
[3:27:04] <+NightOwlSam> Outliving them
[3:27:05] <+skizzuto> pat please kill this skeleton so I can go to bed
[3:27:10] <RubberFistFight> @Egoangell- I am absolutely fuckserious. Look it up, it's totally legit. It's basically her describing how everything down there looks and behaves and everything. It's the part nobody talks about, lol.
[3:27:12] <stigna1> @PeachSaliva San's battle music is "song that may play when you fight sans." It never plays, since at this point you seem to be playing Chara's theme. Its an upbeat, catchy, papyrus-like theme.
[3:27:13] <%SenorCounter> Success, but the other person must see it in some fashion
[3:27:16] <@MelBrooksKA> @PeachSaliva Here's the song http://www.nospoiler.com/y/y4VNZdsjveE
[3:27:16] <Habblewater> Well we need to see what happon
[3:27:18] <+Taglog7> wise advice from pat?!
[3:27:19] <%krawtch> if my enemies are dead, technically im living better than them
[3:27:26] <+barucasanova> @skizzuto no sleep for you
[3:27:27] <%lil_potayto> Living well is a good one.
[3:27:28] <+combustable1> the best form of revenge is BODYBAGS!
[3:27:28] <+DrunkenDice> LUL
[3:27:30] <MissMalisin> moon2L moon2L moon2L
[3:27:30] <%SvenHolgersson> you SHOULD fuck to this
[3:27:34] <smargh1015> the greatest gift insult an enemy can endure, to be ignored
[3:27:35] <%swordsman70> Paige approved
[3:27:35] <Shemegory> It's the song that might play when you fight sans, not when sans fights you. Megalovania is the theme of toby
[3:27:35] <%ssjklyco> She does tell the chat to "Fuck off" alot though.
[3:27:39] <Dragon_Batman> keep up with the beat
[3:27:41] <Hydrapissed> Doing it right nwia9ewa0w
[3:27:42] <%Freelance7> you WILL fuck to this
[3:27:43] <mr_slaide> Can I fuck to this?
[3:27:44] <%SvenHolgersson> Ginger incest is my fetish though
[3:27:44] <%reaped_psyche> I'd fuck to the undertale soundtrack.
[3:27:48] <yosukecchi> the best revenge is getting better pictures of spider-man
[3:27:50] <pettywolfthing> Megalovania = best sex music
[3:27:52] <The_Blumper> when will Plague animate Paige
[3:27:54] <%Yumonikki> @PlagueOfGripes I'm too busy fucking to your Dragonball videos.
[3:27:56] <NemokillerV> it's like the nerd that was bullied who became a tv star
[3:27:57] <Egoangell> @rubberfistfight does anybody get anne frank and lisa frank mixed up?
[3:28:03] <%Freelance7> no
[3:28:10] <SodiumChloride2Tough> Undertale DOES have some good sex music.
[3:28:15] <time_axis> "living well" is literally not revenge, it's being above revenge
[3:28:16] <zaklindo99> @reaped_psyche that'd be pretty intense.
[3:28:17] <MainMan_Jonadiah> The best revenge is when Cartman ground that dude's parents into chili.
[3:28:18] <+Bustamente> Its crazy that fucking Comic Sans is the the best part of this game
[3:28:19] <%HDmexiqtioner> Someone draw fan art of Paige as Uncle Sam, pointing with the caption "I WANT YOU TO FUCK TO THIS!"
[3:28:19] <@MelBrooksKA> No matter what, Paige will love you and she will be proud of you
[3:28:22] <%NWR_James> living well is just good for you. Revenge is about inflicting PAIN
[3:28:25] <%Jjrossman> As in they are DEAD?
[3:28:26] <OkamiDude15> get ready im about to use my "Special" attack Kreygasm
[3:28:29] <$Boot2thehead> We all know the best love making music is Dogsong Kappa Kappa bitButt
[3:28:30] <+Nohamforsam> The best revenge is to just forget them
[3:28:31] <$TheSniperJoe> Revenge is going to bed in your big warm bed with your wife.
[3:28:34] <Ninjagregory98> A screwdriver to the temple also works
[3:28:35] <%Freelance7> felt like a turning point
[3:28:35] <Darren716> Nah the best revenge is to lie to people about syphilous, just like RLM taught me
[3:28:37] <+CluelessSniper> You're doing really good, pat
[3:28:40] <+FujiSyusuke808Live> @PeachSaliva I'm having a tough time with mental health stuff lately. What do you do to deal with anxiety and/or depression?
[3:28:41] <Ell1ot> Just buy their children Large Jars of Glitter
[3:28:46] <+TheOpinionater> Sans is just dio
[3:28:50] <%Djinnazz> meh
[3:28:52] <%ssaryn> Tell them "YOU CAN FUCK TO THIS SUCCESS"
[3:28:52] <+miscinsanity> the best revengeance is carried out with a high frequency blade
[3:28:53] <gyrogogozeppeli> nahhhhhhh
[3:28:53] <%Freelance7> GO PAT
[3:28:54] <%swordsman70> NTR them
[3:28:54] <%ToxInjection> I hate that you're right.
[3:28:54] <serrishtar> so its not actually genuine lol
[3:28:54] <ape_hawk> KILL THEM WITH KINDNESS
[3:28:56] <$rdark_ksu> @PeachSaliva the best revenge is living well
[3:28:56] <taritari> pretend you don't remember them at all
[3:28:57] <+TheCalzone> can confirm this works
[3:28:58] <@Calek> revenge is a dish best served hot, that's why I put it on a low heat and let it simmer
[3:28:58] <@Moobot> We're accepting fanfiction submissions, if you think you have a good one message a mod today!
[3:28:58] <Cheapheatmo> But is it really revenge if they're doing well too?
[3:28:59] <%SvenHolgersson> Are you happy with this Paige?
[3:28:59] <%ssjklyco> The best revenge is the one where they don't even know they've been revenged on and its fucking with them.
[3:28:59] <@MelBrooksKA> Murder them with kindness
[3:29:04] <miguelrod777> kindness out of spite
[3:29:06] <Rhonne> the best revenge is a bat
[3:29:08] <%Djinnazz> i preffer to destroy their mind.
[3:29:08] <%SvenHolgersson> Are you happy killing an entire universe?
[3:29:09] <TheElegantMan> @PeachSaliva also telling them you forget who they are
[3:29:10] <ScallyCapt> the best revenge is killing them softly with this song
[3:29:11] <%StubYourToe> I don't believe in revenge
[3:29:13] <@PlagueOfGripes> the best revenge is to do nothing and watch their life crumble into dust as everyone around them realizes they hate the person they are
[3:29:13] <StarSkullyman> I th8nk an ass kicking is good revenge personally
[3:29:13] <%superc37> why not just stab em
[3:29:15] <Benpower236> Alternatively, game the situation so that they swing first and kick their ass.
[3:29:16] <wsintai> HARD DRUGS
[3:29:16] <%lil_potayto> SUPER NIIIIIIIIIIICEEEEEEEEE
[3:29:17] <+NightOwlSam> sleep with their parents to break them up and become thei step-parent
[3:29:21] <RubberFistFight> @profanityincluded - dude you should watch the RedLetterMedia thing on "IT", they talk about that and how it was fuelled by coke and alcoholism. Stephen King wrote like fucken CRAZY when he had substance abuse issues.
[3:29:24] <%HDmexiqtioner> Revenge is better Microwaved
[3:29:27] <ultimaphoenix8804> being nice to spite others
[3:29:30] <buffmurffy> turn sadness into rage and rage into exercise
[3:29:34] <Sokumotanaka> Sans is what happens when you make matt actually mad enough to fight you and if he had magic bullshit
[3:29:35] <$ImasukyLomae> Fire is best revenge
[3:29:36] <serialtruant> fucking to paige's streams is the best coping mechanism
[3:29:37] <%swordsman70> Anti-depressive depending on the people
[3:29:44] <%superc37> as is stabbing
[3:29:45] <MissMalisin> You mean not everybody is depressed?! Jebaited
[3:29:46] <@thenefftw> Anxiety and depression is real tough to get through. If you find a way to deal with it, please feel free to tell me
[3:29:49] <RedMaskBandit> !uptime
[3:29:49] <@Moobot> 3h 29m 58s since bed time stories began.
[3:30:07] <topendbuzz> @PeachSaliva did you get hooked on pain killers???
[3:30:12] <%HDmexiqtioner> Was it your Pokemon disease?
[3:30:16] <DesuDesuDokiDoki> lol
[3:30:17] <Dragon_Batman> LOL

[3:30:24] <%Johnso1o> THE PAIGE SABOTAGE
[3:30:25] <%profanityincluded> @RubberFistFight im a recovering Stephen King addict, im intimitely familiar with the scene and with King NOT FUCKING KNOWING WHAT BOOKS HE WROTE, JESUS
[3:30:25] <MainMan_Jonadiah> I can't believe Pat styled on Sans so hard this run
[3:30:26] <ObsidianDragon86> PAIGE DON'T DO THE THING!
[3:30:26] <%thisisnotNR> CRAZY LADY TALK
[3:30:28] <swyvar> lol
[3:30:30] <%fangdsniper2nd> CHOKE
[3:30:30] <%Yumonikki> "Lady Talk"
[3:30:31] <+Comrade_Vladof> I can't believe Pat did it perfectly
[3:30:32] <VyperVic> dammit paige
[3:30:32] <%SaltyDongs> PAIGE WHYYYYYY
[3:30:33] <+AXL808> Paige doesn't have to worry about the problems of the world like depression when she has a McDonald's bag on her head
[3:30:35] <%asaoirc> sipsipGasm
[3:30:35] <zaklindo99> God dammed it paige
[3:30:38] <stigna1> Pat's having a bad time!
[3:30:39] <totalmindblank> how many times are we at now?
[3:30:39] <psyguy97> @peachsaliva tell pat to hold all arrow keys when sans bounces him around
[3:30:40] <Valkyrjsen> Don't ask Pat questions. pvpS
[3:30:40] <+FujiSyusuke808Live> @thenefftw I'll be sure. One little trick I learned is cold showers.Gets the blood pumping.
[3:30:40] <Kghaleon> dude let Pat concentrate D:
[3:30:40] <KaiserMario> @PeachSaliva What if someone did something bad to you, not to make you feel bad, but to make themselves feel good? Won't they feel rewarded if your revenge is just be nice to them?
[3:30:41] <reonome> GOOD JOB PAIGE
[3:30:41] <eco419> crazy talk goooo
[3:30:42] <Arweynn> paige stole crazy talk
[3:30:42] <Nixonesque> pie time
[3:30:43] <+James_Quivers> PIE
[3:30:43] <%ssaryn> Yep.
[3:30:44] <SodiumChloride2Tough> Don't fuck your nose, Pat.
[3:30:45] <%ThePushaMan> shes accidentally doing the thing
[3:30:46] <%StubYourToe> What helped Paige was her cauldron of drugs
[3:30:47] <BlueSpartan119> PIE
[3:30:48] <%lil_potayto> Vit D and oranges in the morning. Get as much exercise as you can manage. Make little rituals for yourself. Stop blaming yourself for your condition.
[3:30:49] <DemonicCipher> PIE
[3:30:50] <%ividboy> at least he cant kill you in the menu
[3:30:51] <%ssjklyco> I agree with that
[3:30:52] <%GeneralSCPatton> TEH URN!
[3:30:53] <humanityupgrade> haha Paige is just talking away like it ain't no thing while Pat freaks out
[3:30:53] <$magikestral> Pie
[3:30:54] <%SvenHolgersson> SHOVE A PIE IN THERE
[3:30:55] <Everpresent_Overseer> Py3
[3:30:56] <%salty_syd913> PIE
[3:30:57] <%NWR_James> Paige is Sans' most powerful attack
[3:30:58] <time_axis> good ol' escapism never fails
[3:30:59] <+Bustamente> Escapism YEAH
[3:30:59] <$CorruptDropbear> 3 heals left
[3:31:03] <Caidezes> Pat's right though. Videos games are great therapy.
[3:31:03] <MONSTRx_x> watch anime
[3:31:03] <Ominnous> @PeachSaliva toss out the cinnamon bun next run!!
[3:31:05] <Dektoide> PIE
[3:31:05] <lautalocos> EAT CHOCOLATE
[3:31:05] <%SvenHolgersson> HELLO
[3:31:08] <%dalmek> consistency is good to help get a handle on life
[3:31:09] <Grayhammatter> pie PogChamp
[3:31:11] <@thenefftw> @FujiSyusuke808Live When I remember to take a shower, I'll be certain to keep that in mind
[3:31:15] <%iamnotaparrot> pie
[3:31:25] <%Jaxiis0> SO MUCH PIE HYPE
[3:31:25] <%Falilth> don't let it set in
[3:31:26] <%swordsman70> Oh yeah
[3:31:27] <gypsystranger> @PeachSaliva Sans does care that you killed papyrus, when you spared him he killed you the same way killed papyrus
[3:31:28] <+Taglog7> bad grades WutFace
[3:31:31] <cizal11> WOOF but i can understand kinda also...
[3:31:37] <$lotharrio> Paige, in charge of destroying Pat's run. Also, smoke weed for awhile to deal with depression. Hallucinogens are amazing are dealing with mental health problems, and weed is the simplest, easiest, least horrible to use.
[3:31:40] <+Yakobro> BABY
[3:31:40] <mr_slaide> DUH BABUH
[3:31:40] <%Yumonikki> Genuinely - not trying to be funny - sexualize most things.
[3:31:43] <%Biwaifu> sipsipElmo sipsipElmo sipsipElmo sipsipElmo sipsipElmo
[3:31:44] <+Nomicro4u> From then on Pat learned his lesson. Never try.
[3:31:46] <%LumberjackJack> sipsipElmo
[3:31:46] <%SuichiTanaka> sipsipElmo sipsipElmo sipsipElmo sipsipElmo
[3:31:47] <%GohanEgret> sipsipElmo sipsipElmo sipsipElmo
[3:31:49] <DrakeSilvos> Having music constantly play helps me.
[3:31:51] <%samuraifriend> sipsipElmo sipsipElmo sipsipElmo
[3:31:53] <%Yumonikki> sipsipElmo sipsipElmo sipsipElmo sipsipElmo sipsipElmo
[3:31:54] <%davidsanchan> sipsipElmo
[3:31:55] <RubberFistFight> @profanityincluded - the bit that makes me laugh is that it's passed off in the narrative as a "coming of age"/ritual to bring them closer/a way of defeating IT - but there's like a whole page where Bev talks about how big one of the boys is and how hard he made her cum. Like... they're 11 years old, what the fuck are you writing, Stephen?
[3:31:56] <serialtruant> I have bad OCD and anxiety and I find the best way to get that in check is convincing myself that if I don't freak out i'll get better at handling it
[3:31:56] <%DelightfullyDongus> sipsipElmo sipsipElmo
[3:31:59] <%Dakuu75> I'm certain there's a LOT of us in chat that suffer from severe depression. But, it's very helpful to surround yourself with "positive vibes" like, this and other twitch/youtube channels. -And ppl that support you'n other hobbies that lift your spirits.
[3:31:59] <@Moobot> Do you have a Fanfiction for Paige to read? Submit it to us here and it may get read on stream! http://bit.ly/2jsxJo9
[3:32:04] <%HDmexiqtioner> In walks in the depression killer ELMO!
[3:32:14] <+elclintonio> yo i felt the same way in college
[3:32:19] <%superc37> sipsipElmo sipsipElmo sipsipElmo sipsipElmo sipsipElmo
[3:32:21] <yosukecchi> the real answer is to pet a cat
[3:32:24] <%GohanEgret> elmo is the cure
[3:32:24] <%Yumonikki> sipsipElmo sipsipElmo sipsipElmo sipsipElmo sipsipElmo sipsipElmo sipsipElmo sipsipElmo
[3:32:32] <%StubYourToe> This is pretty much what I do. I get bad worries from time to time.
[3:32:36] <$rdark_ksu> @PeachSaliva simulating actual worse case senarios is a way to put your stuff in perspective
[3:32:38] <BlindGato> so don't PANIC
[3:32:38] <TheElegantMan> EAT THE PIE PAT
[3:32:42] <CynBurn> Pet the Elmo. Best cure for any sadness.
[3:32:43] <+OdysseyKnight> Or an ass zit
[3:32:43] <%Freelance7> FIST SIZED
[3:32:44] <+AXL808> Higher than you think
[3:32:45] <%leafwork> In many many cases, information trumps anxxiety
[3:32:47] <%guessingtwo> if you have depression get a dog or cat and take care of it and pet it
[3:32:48] <+FujiSyusuke808Live> @thenefftw Next time you shower, before you step out, try three minutes in colder water. Not COLD water, freeze your nipples off cold, but colder. Gets the blood pumping in a weird way.
[3:32:49] <%captainthunderwolf> @lotharrio Be careful with that advice though, because a lot of people have conditions that drugs will pretty much only worsen. Bipolar people can become schizos permanently if they take acid, apparently.
[3:32:50] <faegbeard> why do you still have c.buns why have you not bought better healing items you shit
[3:32:52] <%ziriken> Just like Congo
[3:32:52] <hntronium> Its probably cancer
[3:32:53] <%leafwork> in my experience anyway
[3:32:53] <%iamnotaparrot> PIE
[3:32:57] <%ssjklyco> I have put off getting a license for so long that its festering into a big fear of I can't do it now.
[3:32:57] <ape_hawk> speaking of cancer, total biscuit is undergoing massive hospital visits today...
[3:33:00] <Ell1ot> heroes never Pie
[3:33:00] <ShadowZiggy> oh shit we're at Sans
[3:33:02] <MainMan_Jonadiah> Shove the pie wherever it'll fit
[3:33:02] <+Comrade_Vladof> Every time anything is wrong with me I immediately assume it's cancer
[3:33:04] <+ahnuchikibriki> I've gotta go to bed I can't stay up until they beat Sans
[3:33:08] <Zepik> missed some of the last bit, has he hit the long attack yet?
[3:33:15] <+Bustamente> A pet is actually an extremely helpful source of companion ship, looking at you Elmo
[3:33:19] <+Toast_Master_General> Pat has a fist size mole on his ass confirmed
[3:33:20] <ScrubTheNerd> WOW fuck that pattern
[3:33:20] <lautalocos> but the goblins are real
[3:33:21] <%WillowMelody> @Zepik He hasn't even see nit yet.
[3:33:21] <TheImmortal70> Goddamn that's incredibly, INCREDIBLY bad cycling
[3:33:22] <$Metroidzard> Oooops
[3:33:24] <Dragon_Batman> I can totally understand that. It may sound cliche but going stepping outside and walking with music in my ear for a bit helps.
[3:33:26] <reonome> pat lost his groove
[3:33:26] <$CorruptDropbear> 1 heal left
[3:33:27] <buffmurffy> pat on the stomp just hold the direction, do not press
[3:33:33] <Habblewater> Pat has a mole in his ass confirmed
[3:33:33] <%ssaryn> WIPE RIGHT TO LEFT NERD @PeachSaliva
[3:33:35] <DesuDesuDokiDoki> gotta slay them
[3:33:36] <cizal11> OH NO

[3:34:16] <Bladeliger87> oh there goes gravity
[3:34:17] <%Dakuu75> This is why I never like hearing ppl tell other ppl to "kill themselves" even if it's 100% in a joking'n sarcastic manner
[3:34:17] <%AbnormalVoid> EW! I don't like em! I don't like GOBLINS!
[3:34:18] <+SaltyTheRower> @peachsaliva Tell Pat that if he holds all four directions down during the attack that sans throws you around you won't get hit
[3:34:18] <Skion> JUST BEAT THE BOSS 4Head
[3:34:19] <%edited156> If Pat didn't take a break there I think he'd have managed
[3:34:20] <$lotharrio> Pat has done worse since Paige started interacting with Chat.
[3:34:20] <damienlunas> B L U E M E A N S S T O P P A T

[3:39:02] <RubberFistFight> Re: getting a cat. Get a tabby/moggy cat. They are hardier than purebreds and less neurotic, the same as dogs. They generally have pretty even temperaments as well.
[3:39:04] <Railstone> @HarmonyOptional movie trailers for big hollywood movies literally always are
[3:39:05] <TheHeroAppears> You should do Dang it Grandpa, since pat's never played it

[3:42:33] <%Dakuu75> Question: Is anyone counting Pat's attempts?
[3:42:38] <stigna1> Just wait 'till the special attack, yeee.
[3:42:53] <%SvenHolgersson> IT TRUE
[3:42:53] <waterstealer> technically if you try to attack asriel in his bossfight it says miss

[3:42:55] <@thenefftw> THEY'RE RIGHT
[3:42:56] <serialtruant> @baronvonkame It's a synonym for suggar daddy or something
[3:42:57] <MainMan_Jonadiah> I think we're at 24 or 25?
[3:43:00] <%Dakuu75> @stigna1 Yep, no one survives the "Special Attack"
[3:43:01] <AFriendlyDinosaur> man I watched tyler1 try to beat this for almost 7 hours. Good luck!

[3:50:30] <DantesAnimus> Don't talk politics.
[3:50:31] <Zepik> Pat is finally learning the real secret to how much of a grind this fight is. The fact that once you get to the end and keep dying on the HARD part, it's like a 10 min run every attempt to get back there
[3:50:32] <gyrogogozeppeli> Pewdiepie LUL

[3:51:07] <RubberFistFight> @PeachSaliva - oh yeah I will NEVER overact a reaction in a game or make shit up for attention. Apart from the fact that I don't WANT to, I also can't carry it off as remotely genuine.

[3:52:16] <%davidsanchan> bully the peach
[3:52:19] <Idon__> Paige applies her passive-aggresiveness to *everyone equally*
[3:52:20] <JM_FUNK> having sick hooker boots helps. everyone in chat can talk shit about them
[3:52:21] <%ToxInjection> Paige didn't get the memo, being pregnananant and all.
[3:52:23] <Hawkbone_> @PeachSaliva How hard is it for you to believe that some mad motherfucker beat this fight without getting hit? There's a video of it on YouTube. Also fuck you Paige sherbert is the best version of ice cream.
[3:52:23] <SovPho> what are these animated undertale boss fights that they've mentioned
[3:52:28] <Hydrapissed> People hating on the FAKE BOIS!
[3:52:29] <+FujiSyusuke808Live> @PeachSaliva We all know Paige isn't barren because she's got triplets on the way.
[3:52:31] <%captainthunderwolf> @Sokumotanaka It's literally slang when it's used that way, so it's technically completely accurate to use the mildly incorrect version because that's what it means now.
[3:52:32] <Caivyre> Paige with the HARD CALLOUTS, WHAT A BITCH
[3:52:33] <%asaoirc> EL PREGANTE
[3:52:38] <%ItsMeUncleEric> It helps get people in the door but it doesn't keep people around
[3:52:42] <CrimsonCore90> @klefth You're not supposed to like Pat.
[3:52:43] <%StubYourToe> Key to Twitch is just be yourself and stop worrying about growth.

[3:53:12] <%dalmek> i watch for you but Pat is a nice addition for the banter
[3:53:12] <%babblingcabbage> sipsipGasm

[3:53:16] <%LumberjackJack> Kreygasm
[3:53:16] <StarSkullyman> it's kinda for both of you
[3:53:17] <@MelBrooksKA> If Paige was not a super cool gal with a great dynamic with Pat, I wouldn't watch
[3:53:17] <+CaptainJax> pat + paige > paige > pat
[3:53:18] <%ToxInjection> To be fair, if we were fans of Pat, we're used to having bad times anyway.
[3:53:18] <%Jaxiis0> 1000% here for Paige and domestic abuse
[3:53:18] <$lotharrio> I like Pat more than Paige. I want to be his friendo. But like most of my real life friends, I accept that Paige is part of Pat.
[3:53:19] <Anonymasque> I watch because the dynamic between the both of you is AMAZING.
[3:53:21] <+cerberuscarmine> i got the reference! I CLAPPED
[3:53:21] <ahame94> is there an archive of harvester? ive heard of her playing it and i cant find it
[3:53:21] <Dragon_Batman> you both are legitimately kool.
[3:53:23] <+MrMcCrabby> I clapped when she said the reference
[3:53:23] <%SvenHolgersson> Pat is like that sidedish that comes with the meal but is gross so you don't touch it
[3:53:25] <+Nefarious_Bear> Im here for the DYNAMIC
[3:53:25] <Caidezes> It's okay Paige. I hate you both equally. <3
[3:53:27] <%ssjklyco> If i were to be honest, I would not have discovered you if I did not know of the best friends.
[3:53:29] <ScallyCapt> i learned about you through the Best Friends and i dont even watch Pat's streams unless youre there
[3:53:29] <%lil_potayto> Paige, you're legit a treasure to watch.
[3:53:29] <Minicow1> Sweatybois are the secret to stream success
[3:53:31] <grayjammer> WE can smell you through the screen
[3:53:32] <%krawtch> would it work to dye your hair pink, and claim to be against bullying while simultaneously shitting on smaller streamers and shilling hard for overpriced headsets?
[3:53:32] <+niserri> I started watching because of pat, but stayed because of you and elmo doogPaw
[3:53:39] <%ssjklyco> But I do enjoy the streams.
[3:53:39] <DesuDesuDokiDoki> @PeachSaliva Pat is a bigger part of your stream than you are of his, but people watch for both of you.
[3:53:39] <serialtruant> Paige is literally the only streamer I watch, I don't even watch pat
[3:53:41] <Shade075> I started watching you after I found a compolation of your glorious RE7 playthrough
[3:53:41] <xanerts> people came because of pat but stayed for paige
[3:53:43] <Benpower236> I WAS IN THE POOL!
[3:53:46] <MainMan_Jonadiah> I watch to see what unfathomable thing Paige will end up doing / believing.
[3:53:47] <Dovakhin573> Got here because of pat, stayed for all the dumb paige BS lol
[3:53:47] <Mittensbro> it's for the same reason 2BF works, it's the dynamic of the two. pat on his own makes me fall asleep, and paige on her own is... well it almost doesn't happen
[3:53:50] <+ThePayphone> i watch this but not pats solo streams, i honestly prefer combos of people,
[3:53:50] <DantesAnimus> I found out about u because of Pat but the first things I watched were just ur Fanfic reads because I live for that shit.

[3:54:38] <@thenefftw> Mario Sunshine is good
[3:54:39] <%RadicalWeegee> PAT YOUR CRAZY
[3:54:39] <%krawtch> Pat isnt bald, he just dyes the front of it flesh colored
[3:54:41] <JM_FUNK> paige should be the new best friend. we can have lady talk during fisticuffs and scrublords
[3:54:42] <TheElegantMan> WHAT DO YOU MEAN NOT THAT GOOD
[3:54:42] <%ssaryn> It's still better than most 3D Mario games.
[3:54:42] <$Jazzarms> mario sunshine kicks ass shut up pat

[3:54:49] <+Comrade_Vladof> Mario Sunshine is great, fuck you Pat
[3:54:49] <Ravenwingg> Sunshine is great
[3:54:50] <%Freelance7> Mario Sunshine was the only one I liked
[3:54:51] <Hydrapissed> NOT that GOOD !!1 yeah hes right mario 64 better fook bois

[3:54:51] <Bonobonobone> ANGER
[3:54:51] <Personified134> CRAZYTALK
[3:54:52] <%goodguydrew> I originally started watching for Pat but fell in love with Paige, Elmo and the whole cast of characters
[3:54:54] <Ell1ot> wasn't that bully person bullying people on their stream with homophobic comments?
[3:54:55] <ape_hawk> mario sunshine is just a proof of concept for viscera room cleaner
[3:54:56] <%LifesNeverHumDrum> oh that's the only mario game i ever got into
[3:54:57] <%Keyd00d> CHEAT TURNS
[3:54:57] <%StubYourToe> It's like a free turn
[3:54:58] <WizoSavage> it's good until you get to the shit platforming parts
[3:54:58] <%swordsman70> I kind of HAVE to love it
[3:55:00] <DrakeSilvos> It's okay, but you definitely don't want to 100% it.
[3:55:01] <%ividboy> ANGERY SUNSHINE IS GREAT
[3:55:02] <%ItsMeUncleEric> Sunshine is the epitome of "it's ok"
[3:55:03] <%fangdsniper2nd> Sunshine is decent but nothing special
[3:55:04] <sovennix> pat WHAT
[3:55:05] <%ssaryn> Nope.
[3:55:05] <%krawtch> @Ell1ot BOY WERE THEY
[3:55:06] <ArcticAsylum> lies
[3:55:06] <OkamiDude15> fuck that pachinko red coin level lilyTilt
[3:55:06] <%captainthunderwolf> @Ell1ot Yes.
[3:55:07] <TimeWanderer33> Honestly, I started watching because of Pat. But I came back for both of you.
[3:55:09] <+TheShal> How does a Skeleton sweat?
[3:55:09] <SenranKaguraWeeb> its bad i
[3:55:10] <Sokumotanaka> Swindler of progress is my boss name
[3:55:13] <%Dakuu75> I hear a LOT of bad stuff about sunshine. seems to get some rough-hate
[3:55:17] <%captainthunderwolf> Psy-COP-a-thick
[3:55:20] <%ssaryn> Kratos is still worse but that's me.
[3:55:20] <$gamewarden92> Kratos ain't even that bad.
[3:55:20] <faegbeard> psy cop athic
[3:55:22] <%guessingtwo> psychopic
[3:55:29] <$lotharrio> Free turn is the same as free money- Psi-cop-a-thec? Pat what the fuck?
[3:55:29] <+Bustamente> CRAZY TALK ACTIVATES as Sunshine is great
[3:55:30] <$RutilusMonachus> That is the strangest I have ever heard someone say Psycopathic
[3:55:32] <topendbuzz> flowey

[3:55:55] <Habblewater> Poli
[3:55:56] <cizal11> @PeachSaliva pat, you need to save your full heals for this half of the fight, since one heal is a full turn anyway
[3:55:59] <%LumberjackJack> Oof, feels like he could nail it this run, but I don't think he knows about that crazy final attack
[3:55:59] <%Keyd00d> HERE WE GO
[3:56:03] <%Dakuu75> I think the WORST thing about Sunshine is the hidden blue coins because some are in extremely-stupid locations that you'd NEVER find without a guide.

Anyway, point is, in that big attack you're falling and Sans is showing up to watch you fall at each part of the fall.

[4:01:38] <+Nefarious_Bear> THOSE DODGES

[4:02:31] <SrCoolRanch> So when do we get the stream we all really want The Elmo Weapon Hour
[4:02:31] <@MelBrooksKA> Does god approve of straight Pat

[4:02:35] <MONSTRx_x> Ryu is a shota
[4:02:37] <taritari> just stop murdering people then
[4:02:37] <Prevot> HEY PAT WANNA /SS/
[4:02:41] <RubberFistFight> @PortableBoredom - actually back when civilisations fought with edged/bladed weaponry they would often smear human and animal shit on them, that way if the wounds didn't immediately kill their enemies, they'd get horribly infected and kill them that way instead.
[4:02:42] <$Metroidzard> Figure 8
[4:02:46] <%Dakuu75> "Shoto is a 'Loli' but a boy" is that acurate?
[4:02:48] <nzrai> god supports /ss/
[4:02:48] <Klefth> Yeah, pretzel motions
[4:02:49] <MrPlush> Remember, God supports straight shota
[4:02:49] <BigBroski410> “God supports straight Shota”
[4:02:52] <+Bustamente> This stream has it all. Paige, a special needs animal, Elmo.
[4:02:52] <Baron_von_Turkeyfish> but you deserve it pat
[4:02:53] <%swordsman70> With the beard he's a shota without it he's a loli
[4:02:56] <MainMan_Jonadiah> He's learning the tech
[4:02:57] <%ssaryn> OH SHIT
[4:03:00] <%HDmexiqtioner> The Blastters are getting wider

[4:03:02] <%ToxInjection> I NEVER NOTICED THAT
[4:03:02] <%edited156> PAIGE DAMNIT
[4:03:03] <42nfl19> since Sans always dodges, does it even matter if pat aims for the center?
[4:03:05] <alwayspronking> OH FUCK

[4:03:23] <mykhulbee> shit, i never noticed either
[4:03:24] <Antrodox> call matpat
[4:03:34] <%ItsMeUncleEric> Can a game this meta have a canon?
[4:03:36] <$KitkatRai> "I hate that he's attacking me in the menus" I'm sure he hates that he's fighting a near immortal monster who undoes their death, every single time
[4:03:37] <%SvenHolgersson> It's Chara's items
[4:03:39] <@MelBrooksKA> @RubberFistFight There was a similar problem with early guns since the bullets didn't go fast enough to burn off the bacteria
[4:03:48] <%Dakuu75> I'm surprized I got a thing that some others didn't. that sound-effect thing was something I thought was kinda obvious
[4:03:51] <%guessingtwo> sans literally has one hp
[4:03:54] <+wingblade7> @peachsaliva may we have either a motivational speech or bedtime story in undyne's voice?
[4:04:05] <ape_hawk> i mean, a pan makes more sense, since pans would deal blunt damage, and knives deal slashing damage, and skeletons are ALWAYS weaker to blunt damage
[4:04:06] <xSettingSunx> Dagger is just one attack though instead of four, it's faster
[4:04:09] <%Intolerable> Infinity symbol
[4:04:13] <CatmanIX> cloudy glasses and the torn book are best for this fight

[4:04:47] <%davidsanchan> next drawing is peach x undyne
[4:04:47] <SilentEric> @PeachSaliva There is only one Sans. He can teleport and knows about the alternate timelines (Saved games) and is smart enough to make assumptions.
[4:04:47] <RubberFistFight> @MelBrooksKA - actually the ignition of gunpowder is enough to sterilise the bullet. It's everything else that goes into the wound (bits of clothing etc) that aren't sterilised, and that's still a problem today.
[4:04:48] <cj_art> sans x ness

[4:11:30] <%guessingtwo> FORGOT
[4:11:30] <SentientHoodie> HE LITERALLY TOLD YOU AN HOUR AGO
[4:11:30] <DrakeSilvos> She forgot already.
[4:11:31] <%Freelance7> WE TALKED ABOUT THIS
[4:11:32] <MSN04_Sazabi> PAIGE HE TOLD YOU THIS ALREADY
[4:11:34] <Huntercd> Slaanesh is better

[4:11:57] <%Dakuu75> @MSN04_Sazabi @SentientHoodie dude... lol
[4:11:58] <time_axis> is gaster the weird furry inflation fetish kickstarter character that Toby Fox hated and made super hard to find in the game
[4:12:00] <Baron_von_Turkeyfish> no alphys was hired after gaster died
[4:12:00] <RossMirage> Gaster was the previous royal scientist.
[4:12:03] <%ziriken> W D GASTER = WING DINGS
[4:12:06] <+hoenhime344> wait sans and papyrus ARE NOT THE SAME?
[4:12:09] <$waltzqueen> Gaster is assumed to have run the core before Alphys. He might have been the first royal scientist
[4:12:09] <Klefth> Well, the monsters say that Sans and Papyrus just appeared one day...
[4:12:10] <MainMan_Jonadiah> Sans is Ness, don't you know, Pat?!
[4:12:10] <%ryuail1> This isn't Crazy Talk, it's just Undertale fandom
[4:12:18] <%Mornaka> @NMEDom my name come from Mork. in wow i had a character named Morka
[4:12:19] <+EpicAssassin17> no that theory is half baked and bad, so all of game theory vids
[4:12:25] <jisang0415> Stephen universe is sans
[4:12:25] <stigna1> @time_axis Nah, Gaster is Big LOREs. The fetish guy is So Sorry.
[4:12:27] <%ssaryn> There's a lot of dumb theories with this shit. Like Ness from Earthbound being a thing.
[4:12:27] <EASrake> Yeah and Sans is SiIvagunner too
[4:12:27] <%Dakuu75> @PeachSaliva there's jsut theories, theres not a lot of HARD-FACT-LORE
[4:12:30] <%ividboy> why pat
[4:12:30] <%guessingtwo> @time_axis no, thats So Sorry
[4:12:30] <thebeatsandrhymes> the undertale fandom IS Crazy Talk
[4:12:30] <Twoiis> Pretty much everything is heresay
[4:12:31] <Ozmodyas> Gaster got fractured across space and time by time experiments, which is why he disappeared from the game and only exists as data bits in the files now
[4:12:32] <devanmuse> don't take Game Theory as gospel on this
[4:12:34] <xSettingSunx> Dr. W.D. Gaster was the royal scientist before Alphys. He created the CORE, but after "falling into his creation" his body was scattered across time and space.
[4:12:36] <%TheGershon> IT'S JUST A THEORY
[4:12:38] <Arweynn> the implication is that gaster was thier dad: they dont age anymore because he doesn't exist, they 'just appeared' because without gaster existing they couldn't be born, ect

[4:14:27] <%Dakuu75> really?
[4:14:30] <%ividboy> Undertale is the most diagetic game I have ever seen
[4:14:32] <cj_art> so how much of this is fan theories and how much of it is canon
[4:14:36] <+ThePayphone> pat should tell her the dialogue you get when you try to cheat/ hack the game
[4:14:36] <%fangdsniper2nd> Only says in in repwat nuetral runs
[4:14:37] <TheElegantMan> Sans is absolutely Ness as @Benpower236 said Kappa
[4:14:39] <%krawtch> like 80/20
[4:14:42] <%shinynewbuttons> Toby Fox has been like nearly 100% silent about everything involving the game
[4:14:43] <%ziriken> Everything is canon in undertale
[4:14:44] <%LifesNeverHumDrum> the whole stream is the Sans Show
[4:14:46] <iambqb> Flowey's nickname for Sans is Smiley Trashbag
[4:14:47] <%Dakuu75> @spacehouse does that do something? naming a save file "Gaster"?
[4:14:47] <%shinynewbuttons> It’s nuts.
[4:14:49] <serrishtar> creators who make things ambiguous on purpose and then explain it later anyway are the worst
[4:15:02] <gyrogogozeppeli> like people freaked out about DDLC's gimmick but Undertale pretty much did this shit before
[4:15:03] <devanmuse> If Toby Fox wanted Sans' history to be clear, the stuff in his secret room -- that is already hard to find in game -- would've been made a lot clearer
[4:15:07] <%Colehatter> "THE MAN WHO SPEAKS IN HANDS"
[4:15:09] <ghost_teeth> Flowey will talk about some of his save files if you keep killing asgore without resetting for the pacifist run

Also gonna second that suggestion from the other day for 40k: Space Marine for the stream! I heard you say Khorne! You get to be a 7', 1000 pan BIG AND STRONG Space Marine! You'd love it!
[4:15:19] <DesuDesuDokiDoki> no
[4:15:22] <%SvenHolgersson> NO
[4:15:22] <%xijiy> AHAHAHAHA
[4:15:22] <taritari> no no no
[4:15:23] <%Warfey> N O
[4:15:26] <%ryuail1> Sans also speaks in Aster when his eyes are turned off.
[4:15:27] <faegbeard> BIG lies
[4:15:27] <%rugelachs> WORST ROUTE
[4:15:29] <%deadlypartition> OH NO NONONONOONONONON
[4:15:31] <%Jjrossman> CINNEBUn
[4:15:31] <+KanjiBestHusbando> It's speculated that the notes in the True Lab are written by both Gaster and Alphys. The ones with proper capitalization are by Gaster and the lowercase ones are Alphys
[4:15:32] <MSN04_Sazabi> YOU CAN'T DO IT FIRST LUL
[4:15:33] <%SvenHolgersson> The true canon is to no do this AT ALL
[4:15:35] <+MrMcCrabby> BIG LIES
[4:15:38] <$ImasukyLomae> that's a huge lie
[4:15:39] <Sokumotanaka> @serrishtar Not the worse but should be monitiored
[4:15:42] <Junkles> you can get into sans' room
[4:15:43] <DLN002> LIES, VERY BIG
[4:15:43] <@PlagueOfGripes> it said that an accident happened during an experiment and that he "fell in"
[4:15:45] <%krawtch> science treadmill
[4:15:46] <%xijiy> Someone trying to do us a big spoil
[4:15:48] <thebeatsandrhymes> I mean technically speaking, Sans is the weakest enemy in the game since he only has 1 HP, 1 ATK and 1 DEF, but because he has the same sort of knowledge as Frisk/Chara and Flowey he's just a huge pain in the ass
[4:15:49] <Damashi_The_Kaotic> Doing Genocide first is a bad idea.
[4:15:50] <RubberFistFight> Sans' super secret special attack is so large it will pierce the heavens.
[4:15:53] <%ssaryn> Waow
[4:15:53] <%Warfey> limesS
[4:15:53] <%Dakuu75> NO! Like, I never played this game, I've only watche dplaythroughs but, you NEVER do genocide runs first
[4:15:54] <Habblewater> i only just got that they were named after fonts, fuck me
[4:15:55] <%deadlypartition> if you do the pacifist run after genocide chara takes over frist's body and kills everyone after the end
[4:15:57] <%KaiserRolled> I never knew that
[4:16:02] <DifferentKindOfAngel> Gaster is probably all of their surnames
[4:16:03] <%Kataguro> Huh, learn something new every day
[4:16:04] <%Keyd00d> big if true
[4:16:07] <+CluelessSniper> No, it's not aster
[4:16:09] <%fangdsniper2nd> I think its Sans Aster
[4:16:14] <humanityupgrade> looks the same to me
[4:16:14] <%A1Cartwood> I thought it was the game font
[4:16:17] <+NightOwlSam> doing another pacifist run after genocide has a creepy ending if you go w/toriel
[4:16:18] <TimeWanderer33> That was the same.
[4:16:18] <waterstealer> ISNT THE WHOLE GAME IN ASTER
[4:16:18] <%fangdsniper2nd> A comic sans varient
[4:16:19] <@corn_on_fire> looks exactly the same to me
[4:16:21] <%JoeButt> @PeachSaliva the Gaster followers say that he fell into his "invention" People think it was the core. I think he fell into the time machine in Sans room
[4:16:25] <%Freelance7> It's literally the same
[4:16:27] <cizal11> @PeachSaliva paige please tell him to save his full heals for the second half , he keeps wasting them on the easy part.
[4:16:30] <@MelBrooksKA> https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aster_(typeface)
[4:16:33] <%guessingtwo> *sees same font* "its a different font"
[4:16:35] <theSoberSoldier> PAIGE understand that when Sans speaks his "HUEHUEHUHE" It is literally his theme just sped up really fast
[4:16:36] <topendbuzz> hmm
[4:16:43] <cj_art> NotLikeThis
[4:16:45] <FIame> Sans Aster... SASSter LUL
[4:16:48] <%korth367> undertale truly has deep lore
[4:16:49] <%Dakuu75> Wow... I'M learning some new lore too
[4:16:51] <KoyaMusa> nah his name is sans undertale duh
[4:16:56] <$autismweaponised> No real canon tho
[4:16:56] <%shinynewbuttons> It’s comic sans in bold I’m pretty sure
[4:16:57] <DrakeSilvos> We're getting deep into the theorycraft.
[4:16:57] <%Freelance7> Mr. Undertale
[4:16:59] <+StriderGerry> where does the franklin badge come into this LUL
[4:17:03] <@thenefftw> Fan theories inbound
[4:17:04] <ImperfectWeapons> DAT CRIT THO
[4:17:06] <stigna1> Name is Ness Earthbound, obviously.
[4:17:09] <%SvenHolgersson> PEACH'S FANFIC BEGINS
[4:17:09] <@Moobot> We're accepting fanfiction submissions, if you think you have a good one message a mod today!
[4:17:09] <Klefth> @shinynewbuttons Nope.
[4:17:12] <$Jazzarms> maybe it will all be explained in Undertale 2: Overstory
[4:17:12] <+other_badger> NOPE
[4:17:12] <MainMan_Jonadiah> Welcome to the Undertale theory-crafting shenanigans Paige, there's years of material for you to catch up on.
[4:17:15] <TheElegantMan> @PeachSaliva I think the whole game is in aster?
[4:17:17] <%Jjrossman> @PeachSaliva Get rid of that damn cinnebunny first it has the less health regen
[4:17:22] <RoughDraftHN> Clock has been reset Paige check Twitter if you have the chance.
[4:17:27] <%krawtch> basically the last 10 things you've said are just fan cooked up bullshit
[4:17:27] <%ssaryn> That Ness from Earthbound shit is too much in my opinion.
[4:17:34] <%Jjrossman> or not
[4:17:34] <+BJLE> Damn, I left for an hour. I thought they wouldve beaten it by now
[4:17:36] <%SvenHolgersson> Undertale 2: The Search For More Furry Money
[4:17:37] <spill_skill> sans is an anagram for Steven after not surviving @peachsaliva
[4:17:46] <RossMirage> @PeachSaliva Remember someone in Snowin mentioned the skeleton brothers just "appeared" one day. Some theorized they are Gaster split into two.
[4:17:54] <CatmanIX> no one thinks he's Ness, not even game theory
[4:18:02] <%TheGershon> I like how Paige is reading EVERYTHING now. We missed you <3
[4:18:03] <TheZombiepope> Deep undertale fact: sans is named after the font
[4:18:04] <SolitudeOtM> Sans being Ness is really stupid
[4:18:05] <%Kataguro> The obsession of hot grey spider girls
[4:18:07] <+EpicAssassin17> S: StevenA: AfterN: NotS: Surviving
[4:18:08] <+CluelessSniper> All of this is just fan bullshit
[4:18:09] <+vdalson> man chat is making up shit now
[4:18:10] <%guessingtwo> the undertale font is a custom font not aster
[4:18:11] <%superc37> @spill_skill okay now thats just headcanon dude
[4:18:13] <%Dakuu75> Quesiton: are there any other Undertale fans that have learned some NEW lore or believable theories? lol
[4:18:15] <+Jv9ufxcy> We're reaching levels of game theory that shouldn't be possible
[4:18:17] <%ssaryn> What a bunch of bitches.
[4:18:18] <smargh1015> @spill_skill im Steven does that make me ness?
[4:18:19] <%krawtch> bitch nerds!
[4:18:20] <Dragon_Batman> well scotts a nerd
[4:18:20] <mothdude> He can't be Ness. He's not wearing a striped shirt.
[4:18:21] <%ividboy> yous a bitch
[4:18:21] <Baron_von_Turkeyfish> and thats why sans gets to attack first
[4:18:24] <OkamiDude15> sans is spelled backwards with an X in the middle
[4:18:27] <MikeMustBeShortForMicycle> one single bitch
[4:18:28] <Benpower236> Bitch Scotty?
[4:18:32] <damienlunas> The Megalovania stuff is completely wrong because Megalovania was made for Homestuck, and that was its name back then.
[4:18:32] <$Mrdoctorprofessorhipster> Will you people shut up with your shitty Undertale theories
[4:18:36] <lord_souls> whos rick and scoot?
[4:18:37] <theSoberSoldier> yes, his HUE HUE is his theme sped up. Look it up yourself @PeachSaliva
[4:18:40] <devanmuse> The idea of this being your theme is also kind of backed up since Sans is the only enemy who gets the first attack. You are HIS final boss
[4:18:40] <%fangdsniper2nd> @PeachSaliva There is so much we don't know. All I know is that you need to listen to Gaster's theme. Dark, Darker, Yet Darker
[4:18:45] <quinnage7> you kept count?
[4:18:47] <+poverty_king> so fucking COOOOOLLL
[4:18:50] <Foymic> Took me 15 first time FeelsGoodMan

[4:18:58] <+Bustamente> Deep Undertale Lore: Floweys design takes inspiration from the real world plant, called a flower
[4:18:59] <%KaiserRolled> LuL
[4:19:02] <%guessingtwo> sans keeps count
[4:19:06] <%SvenHolgersson> N I C E
[4:19:09] <+Hilleltaco> @damienlunas it was around before Homestuck actually, it was in Toby's Earthbound halloween hack
[4:19:11] <stigna1> Undertale truely is the Dark Souls of videogames.
[4:19:11] <cizal11> @damienlunas that's not true, it was made even earlier than that for a halloween earthbound romhack. but in terms of just this game, it probably is true. but there's no way to know for sure.
[4:19:13] <%ssaryn> FREE MONEY.
[4:19:14] <+SlagChambers> LOL
[4:19:16] <CrimsonCore90> @bustamente that's just a myth
[4:19:21] <%LumberjackJack> After I got "dunked on," I gave up, personally. Too much mental stress
[4:19:23] <%superc37> ITS FKIN FREE
[4:19:27] <+NightOwlSam> he got dunked on
[4:19:28] <$Jazzarms> guys stop insulting her boots, that's how they gain power
[4:19:30] <%Freelance7> GET DUNKED ON
[4:19:33] <pectusumbra> holy shit it's almost 230 and this is still going
[4:19:35] <%DelightfullyDongus> @Bustamente what's a flower?
[4:19:40] <$Agami23> i can hear him coming to my room now
[4:19:44] <@MelBrooksKA> Man, I'm glad I don't have early morning classes tomorrow
[4:19:46] <%davidsanchan> Those boots were made for walking, through the dump
[4:19:46] <%Dakuu75> @damienlunas well yeah, but, that doesn't mean the song can't have different lore/purposes that are specific for this game only. (Although I don't believe it's "your" theme, that theory seems a push.)
[4:19:48] <serialtruant> Headcanon Weapon Hour
[4:19:58] <DesuDesuDokiDoki> wow
[4:19:59] <%salty_syd913> OH
[4:20:00] <Prevot> what is this fanfic bullshit
[4:20:00] <+LtShuckle> @peachsaliva the actual reason you can’t call toriel is because the annoying dog ate her phone
[4:20:00] <+trnzero> Deep Undertale Lore: The skeleton brothers are based on formations of calcium inside of humans' bodies
[4:20:05] <MONSTRx_x> mind destroyed

[4:20:18] <%fangdsniper2nd> Anything is possible
[4:20:20] <%guessingtwo> fan theories are fun
[4:20:23] <@thenefftw> This is truly the Dark Souls of lore
[4:20:23] <gyrogogozeppeli> much of Gaster wikis are fan theory BS
[4:20:25] <%Kataguro> Paige is getting very turned on by shitty theories
[4:20:25] <Chumblago13> i hate fan theories for games
[4:20:25] <Klefth> You can find some of his followers, but it's super rare. Fucking "fun values", lol.
[4:20:25] <%Dakuu75> wut?
[4:20:27] <$lotharrio> Damn, that was like an hour ago. But I got so nervous when Paige-senpai mentioned me.
[4:20:28] <MainMan_Jonadiah> Game Theory: Sans, Papyrus, and Gaster were dead the whole time.
[4:20:29] <+unknowingchuck> so many fan theories NotLikeThis
[4:20:32] <%Jaxiis0> cheer100 When Sans kills you while sparing, he's killing you the same way you killed Papyrus. He offers you a hug and then murders you when you take it. Also before you start the fight he asks if you think anyone can be a good person if they try, which is the last thing papyrus tells you
[4:20:43] <theSoberSoldier> Gaster's theme is Papyrus's theme but backwards.@PeachSaliva

[4:21:03] <%Jaxiis0> pogmafoine
[4:21:04] <+EpicAssassin17> Game Theory: Did sans and papyrus put Crash bandicoot in Undertale?
[4:21:05] <CatmanIX> @cj_art its all theories mate, if you're looking for confirmed canon there's none of it in regards to Gaster
[4:21:06] <%ssjklyco> Pull my bone
[4:21:07] <+FujiSyusuke808Live> There is no such thing as an unhealthy amount of smut. You cannot have too much smut.
[4:21:07] <Benpower236> Nonsense, never too much smut.

[4:24:41] <+Tapt58> kappa100 Double down and be like the guy when commenting on the bayonetta r34 ' No you're doing it wrong, she wouldn't be the sub '
[4:24:42] <%guessingtwo> you cant get the apron in genocide
[4:24:43] <%lil_potayto> cheer100 Hey Paige, it's 7:30 at time of typing here in the green Republic or Ireland. Best excuse to stay up all night of course. You two are a treasure. Hopefully Pat has seen his way to victory by time of reading. Love you both, Elmo and even your ugly, smelly, affront to god boots. STAY DETERMINED!
[4:24:43] <+ih8mylifeffs> Megalovania being in homestuck doesn’t discredit the theory of the song being your theme cause in homestock it was actually the final boss’ theme and it applied to him.

[4:24:58] <+zamatermort> ANIME IS REEEEEAL
[4:25:06] <%BoboDaHobo> I'm genuinely impressed with how chill Pat has been this whole time
[4:25:06] <lovebass4stuff> Here is my advice: when you get to the last part in the fight. Stay in that small circle, closet to the blasting as possible.
[4:25:07] <+Hilleltaco> @PeachSaliva All this genocide run stuff is great because it's sort of playing on how players act. Flowey is pretty much an in-universe version of your "I have to know what happens" mindset towards doing this run. He just wanted to see what would happen
[4:25:08] <OkamiDude15> drawing lewds? like.... h-h-hand holding and dare i say head pats? lilyDrool
[4:25:10] <nzrai> lewds are eternal, anime lewds more so
[4:25:12] <skeletonknifefight> when you gotta piss real bad but dont wanna miss a thing
[4:25:13] <%lil_potayto> It's as real as you let it be.
[4:25:16] <ape_hawk> if you have an engineering degree, you MIGHT get a job in retail
[4:25:16] <@thenefftw> @PeachSaliva Paige, you chose this, not because you had to, not because you were forced to, but because you had the worst excuse possible. You were just curious what would happen.
[4:25:22] <Syrushmx> @peachsaliva The first time you pass over the boat room in Snowdin, a random phone call can occur. And in one occasion, one of the calls could be from Gaster or Sans, but remains anonymus
[4:25:23] <@MelBrooksKA> Go to your schools career advising
[4:25:28] <DrakeSilvos> Eh I dropped out of my engineering program.
[4:25:34] <%LifesNeverHumDrum> nice
[4:25:34] <MainMan_Jonadiah> DBH?
[4:25:38] <%LifesNeverHumDrum> make him suffer
[4:25:38] <%wispernrain> DBH?
[4:25:38] <+CluelessSniper> That's a great idea
[4:25:39] <stigna1> @PeachSaliva Since we're doing lore, remember how at the end of pacifist Alphys beat Sans to a punchline and everyone was surprised that the Royal scienctist and the random skeleton from snowden knew each other?
[4:25:40] <+HiroTSK5> DBH?
[4:25:40] <Dragon_Batman> That's a really good point
[4:25:41] <devanmuse> okay I muscled it out as long as I could, but I really need to sleep. I'll catch the VOD in the morning. Stay Determined!

[4:28:21] <Darren716> this is fucking dumb
[4:28:21] <%fangdsniper2nd> Sans and Gaster have some kind of relationship. Sans knows sciency shit. Sans knows about time lines. Gaster was the last royal scientist. Beyond that is unconfirmed @PeachSaliva
[4:28:25] <%TheGershon> How much money is that?
[4:28:26] <%StubYourToe> lol these guys
[4:28:27] <stigna1> @PeachSaliva Since we're doing lore, remember how at the end of pacifist Alphys beat Sans to a punchline and everyone was surprised that the Royal scienctist and the random skeleton from snowden knew each other?
[4:28:28] <Kemmybelle> Unless the guys are planning on LPing it, or regardless of their plans, maybe you and Pat could play A Way Out together one day?
[4:28:31] <%StubYourToe> $100

[4:29:13] <@thenefftw> That's something I hadn't thought about
[4:29:14] <Nitsuj293> It was Paps
[4:29:14] <SilentEric> Two halves of Gaster
[4:29:15] <%Marg0_Pol0> Maybe it's a family ability?
[4:29:15] <%Jaxiis0> it's papyrus
[4:29:15] <waterstealer> undyne says papyrus is tough
[4:29:16] <%fangdsniper2nd> Thatis actually intersting
[4:29:16] <thebeatsandrhymes> nah it's Paps
[4:29:17] <Hydrapissed> Papy roos didnt do shit and even hes fake attack that he does gets messed up by a dog
[4:29:18] <0range_> It is papyrus
[4:29:18] <%ividboy> papyrus can do that
[4:29:19] <pectusumbra> no, no, even Undyne confirms that Papyrus is actually strong
[4:29:24] <+CluelessSniper> He's not stupid 😡
[4:29:25] <CptOverkill> "you're blue now, thats my attack" IT WAS THE TRUTH OH NO
[4:29:26] <damienlunas> Undyne says Papyrus is pretty tough.
[4:29:28] <Shade075> @MainMan_Jonadiah That is one of my most hated fan theory, and some people actually believe it.
[4:29:31] <%Warfey> that's like conspiracy level stuff that you could never prove, but still... limesHmm
[4:29:31] <@Moobot> YOU'RE BEING TOO LOUD! (Mornaka) (warning)
[4:29:32] <mr_slaide> Children say that?
[4:29:32] <+Aeirus> I also love the detail that Papyrus had a Gaster Blaster and the only reason he didn't use it on you is cuz the annoying dog stole it
[4:29:32] <mothdude> Don't downplay Papyrus.
[4:29:33] <%ItsMeUncleEric> woof
[4:29:36] <+ThatGuyfromMars> papyrus is a good boy and can make you blue on his own

[4:29:37] <theSoberSoldier> LIT SHOOK
[4:29:38] <%StubYourToe> What if Papyrus is super powerful, but he has no desire to hurt others so his abilities never appear
[4:29:40] <%SvenHolgersson> PAT HUSH
[4:29:41] <taritari> but are you WOKE
[4:29:41] <MSN04_Sazabi> Papyrus is very tough physically, he has the 2nd or 3rd highest attack in the game
[4:29:41] <%guessingtwo> all health in one attack
[4:29:41] <%WillowMelody> It's probably more likely that they just happen to have the same abilities and perhaps even the same strength, but only Sans ever actually wants to kill you.
[4:29:42] <@corn_on_fire> Lit Fam CurseLit
[4:29:43] <Prevot> Paige is basically Papyrus
[4:29:44] <%krawtch> The youngspeak caused that Pat

[4:29:45] <$gamewarden92> The Skeleton family is stronk.
[4:29:45] <%rugelachs> that's what using slang incorrectly does
[4:29:46] <Graxe_> Papyrus is actually stronger than Sans. Sans just hits you more often to make up for it.

Translated, it is: ENTRY NUMBER SEVENTEEN. DARK. DARKER. YET DARKER. THE DARKNESS KEEPS GROWING. THE SHADOWS CUTTING DEEPER. PHOTON READINGS NEGATIVE. THIS NEXT EXPERIMENT. SEEMS. VERY. VERY. INTERESTING... WHAT DO YOU TWO THINK? (slight grammar edits included)
[4:30:26] <%Dakuu75> *Elvis voice* An i'm all shook-up, uuUuhh-UUH-UuuUUhh~
[4:30:28] <Silent_Fyraena> If you'll remember in the pacifist run, when you're saving the souls of your friends, there's a bit where Sans is talking about 'never seeing them again'. That's where all the 'Sans is stuck from another place/time' stuff comes from.
[4:30:30] <%BunkusFreskie> Is Asgore an allegory for Oedipus????
[4:30:31] <bryanmildew> asgore, toriel and the third thing all the similar powers too
[4:30:33] <stigna1> @PeachSaliva always thought of it as fighting Paps, but Sans gives your heart a bit of help when you're making that huuuuge leap over Pap's big attack.
[4:30:34] <%Scales_Tipper> I think Sans helps you with that last jump against Papyrus

But since you don't care about lewds being made about either of you, what about weirdos roleplaying as one of you on one of many degenerate websites? Asking for a fellow furtrash friend and for sure not because I want to make a joke profile. Also Pat please call your sub Discord cowards who won't even get down with centaurs.

[4:34:07] <%captainthunderwolf> @breakfastmegapowers Bits are roughly worth a penny, but Twitch's premium on them makes them a bit more expensive and makes them worth a bit less for the streamers.

[4:37:23] <%captainthunderwolf> @Cynful_Pleasures I mean if you're gonna bring that fuck shadman into the conversation, then the rules change. That fucker just draws guro for fun.
[4:37:29] <MainMan_Jonadiah> Toby didn't think anyone would be that CRAZY
[4:37:30] <+ThatGuyfromMars> @treemanfour god have we. Pat has gotten so close
[4:37:30] <%Mornaka> THIRTYFOUR, STAY DETERMINED
[4:37:35] <VritraReiRei> LUL
[4:37:35] <%rugelachs> PAT
[4:37:36] <%Dakuu75> @waterstealer yeah there's like a damn one in one-thousand chance of running into Gaster in game. Same with getting that "alternate-song" for this fight
[4:37:36] <Mr_tonsu> there is if you reset after killing him
[4:37:36] <Prevot> OOF
[4:37:38] <+Bustamente> Well i'm going to sleep too, but i reckon i'm going to have to hum megalovania for 25 minutes before i do so.
[4:37:39] <@thenefftw> You're a GENETIC FREAK
[4:37:43] <+hoenhime344> stay determined
[4:37:44] <%profanityincluded> jesus christ this is still going on?
[4:37:47] <%SuichiTanaka> Pat's getting too tired, making simple mistakes
[4:37:51] <serrishtar> i mean thats just a genocide speedrun at that point
[4:37:51] <%guessingtwo> cheer500 Using my prime discount and fry cook money to tell you to order your burger without buns if you dont want them. Buns have to be prepared, takes time. Now I must sleep to have energy to make your fries.
[4:37:54] <Benpower236> Big Poppa Bone.
[4:37:55] <MissMalisin> THAT'S HARDCORE PogChamp
[4:37:58] <%LifesNeverHumDrum> r u sure ur a pat clone
[4:37:58] <Dethhollow> If you get past Undyne without saving Sans should just let you go
[4:37:58] <+Hilleltaco> Apparently Flowey is actually the hardest one to do without getting hit, it's been done as well though
[4:37:59] <serialtruant> very dead, very lift
[4:38:04] <DesuDesuDokiDoki> lewd
[4:38:09] <thebeatsandrhymes> octoLewd
[4:38:10] <pectusumbra> there is dialog for normal/pacifist runs though, when you talk to sans in the resturant
[4:38:11] <%GeneralSCPatton> RIP SOME FAT SWOLES
[4:38:11] <$waltzqueen> im going to sleep to the sounds of megalovania. Night and GODSPEED
[4:38:11] <ErraticPillow> yes there is
[4:38:15] <%krawtch> statistically speaking, he had a thirty-three and a third percent chance of beating Sans on the first try
[4:38:16] <%davidsanchan> shirt ripping biceps
[4:38:20] <$lotharrio> So many doctors in this chat... I'm only a Master. BibleThump Outside chance you see this Paige, Pat, but Lisa: the Painful, is an Earthbound style game, with vague Suikoden elements, and a worse than Fallout setting.
[4:38:20] <@Moobot> Do you have a Fanfiction for Paige to read? Submit it to us here and it may get read on stream! http://bit.ly/2jsxJo9
[4:38:20] <+UnitedWeGhost> Etika’s play though of the sans fight is something else
[4:38:23] <%Cynful_Pleasures> @captainthunderwolf I was more talking about him drawing loli porn of actual people and children in this example. I've seen worse guro than the stuff he does
[4:38:24] <%fangdsniper2nd> cheer100 Sans' attacks seem to be better than Paps in every way...except two. Pap has the ability to slide his bones up and down the screen mid attack and make them absolutely massive. It seems that Pap has more control over his bones but lacks Sans' extra bullshit powers and better blue attack. I bet Sans was very proud of his bro's magic
[4:38:26] <RossMirage> @PeachSaliva Fun fact: If you try to name the fallen human after another ingame, that character will not allow it. If yuo try to name it Gaster, the game will reset to the intro cinematic.
[4:38:26] <+Jaysky> There IS different dialogue if you defeat Sans and then reload and do it again.
[4:38:30] <+wingblade7> @peachsaliva any advice on the dating world?
[4:38:32] <%Kataguro> Sans has a 141 2/3 chance of winning at Sacrifice
[4:38:33] <%BunkusFreskie> pat is the COCK MAN
[4:38:37] <SolitudeOtM> UghPat, I want to sleepPlease win!
[4:38:39] <Huntercd> @captainthunderwolf DDLG is not pedophilia. ABDLs are not into children
[4:38:40] <thelovingfool> im going tomorrow actually
[4:38:41] <Shade075> I want to ask what is DDLG but seeing the chat, I'm not sure if I want to know
[4:38:41] <SilentEric> @PeachSaliva Reset after killing Sans for unique dialogue.
[4:38:41] <%Dakuu75> @profanityincluded yeah, he's on like.. trial 35+ or something but, he's gotten skilled enough to pass the part where Sans Spares him.
[4:38:43] <%captainthunderwolf> @Cynful_Pleasures Well, yeah, fair point.
[4:38:45] <%im_just_shiny> @PeachSaliva tell pat he is big and he is strong along with elmo
[4:38:46] <+CaptainObnoxious> I'll be honest, while I know the game tries really hard to make you not do a genocide run, I felt like the genocide run story is underwhelming.
[4:38:46] <%LifesNeverHumDrum> and dont worry if the first meds dont work. there's many kinds of antidepressants/anxiety meds
[4:38:50] <%breakfastmegapowers> I would donate more often if I wasn't always doing my 10,000 push up sets... in my dreams
[4:39:03] <%StridentSong> That's 100% true
[4:39:09] <%captainthunderwolf> @Huntercd Yeah, their dicks just get hard when they pretend to fuck kids. It's because of how into fucking kids they aren't.
[4:39:09] <DemonicCipher> yes its true
[4:39:14] <%BunkusFreskie> that is awesome
[4:39:17] <stigna1> @PeachSaliva Since we're doing lore, remember how at the end of pacifist Alphys beat Sans to a punchline and everyone was surprised that the Royal scienctist and the random skeleton from snowden knew each other?
[4:39:20] <DrakeSilvos> And that hole has no end.
[4:39:21] <%fangdsniper2nd> Doesn't that also trigger entry 17?
[4:39:23] <%davidsanchan> name yourself Frisk next
[4:39:30] <FairOnFire> There's already solo vids of Kulve Taroth in the wild
[4:39:32] <%BunkusFreskie> can I just suck off Toby Fox for that?
[4:39:36] <vonmaultke> Fit muscular girls are howwwt no1KYAA
[4:39:40] <@corn_on_fire> ^
[4:39:41] <%Dakuu75> lol AWESOME. I didn't know that
[4:39:43] <@corn_on_fire> this guy gets it
[4:39:47] <OkamiDude15> ^^^
[4:39:47] <%breakfastmegapowers> No, never suck off Toby
[4:39:49] <Sonikah> cheer500 Sans does care about Papyrus, but stopping you is more important right now. Also, Sans x Toriel is OTP
[4:39:55] <%Warfey> wait, what?
[4:39:57] <%ividboy> @PeachSaliva No pat's wrong, he says something like, "wow, you look really mad"
[4:39:57] <+MellowYellowFellow> PAT YOU CAN DO IT
[4:40:07] <+EpicAssassin17> i mean alphys did have like 15 cameras in snowdin
[4:40:12] <%Dakuu75> So resetting AFTER winning anyway makes Sans be like "Are you for real... you fucking killed me... BUT, CAME BACK FOR MORE?!" hahahaha, crazy
[4:40:15] <emillionghost> i LOVE danganronpa
[4:40:16] <DesuDesuDokiDoki> NOOOOOO
[4:40:16] <%captainthunderwolf> @Cynful_Pleasures Yeah, okay, fair. I knew about that, but goddamn if that wasn't a real thing I tried to avoid remembering. That shit's twisted. So yeah, good job, you've hit a few levels more degenerate.
[4:40:17] <Sokumotanaka> Does he really say that? that's fucked
[4:40:18] <AFriendlyDinosaur> danganronpa is nice. paige will like it
[4:40:19] <DLN002> @peachsaliva The GASTER naming easter egg is also the also known thing that outright crashes the PS4 version, rather than soft resetting like with the Flowey fight
[4:40:22] <waterstealer> the secret gaster message says "what do you two think" ALPHYS AND SANS
[4:40:23] <%ziriken> !hooker
[4:40:23] <@Moobot> It has been 0 Days 0 Hours 0 Minutes since last being mistaken for a hooker.
[4:40:24] <Prevot> !hooker
[4:40:24] <%Kataguro> Which DR girl would Paige want to kill most? Is it Asahina?
[4:40:26] <Dethhollow> Danganrompa would be great to stream
[4:40:28] <%Warfey> yeeeee dagnam grandpa!
[4:40:28] <%BunkusFreskie> God damn Pat has a willpower of iron
[4:40:31] <EASrake> don't sell out peach. Play dragons dogma
[4:40:34] <%Solid_Seth> Fun fact: The programmer for Photoshop Flowey confirmed on Slowbeef’s stream of this, This boss was supposed to be WAY HARDER!
[4:40:34] <Dragon_Batman> so pay pat to play the dangans?
[4:40:36] <%Jaxiis0> LUL
[4:40:38] <+other_badger> paige would aspire to be sakura
[4:40:41] <Stab_master_ars0n> Pat is right
[4:40:41] <pectusumbra> Oh yeah, and someone can help push her towards the handplates comics
[4:40:41] <Kghaleon> weeb games
[4:40:42] <%LifesNeverHumDrum> Bribery is just Flattery, but when you put your money where your mouth is
[4:40:44] <Huntercd> @captainthunderwolf I have friends that are in DDLG relationships none of them are pedos
[4:40:47] <Benpower236> If you flatter while you bribe you can get whatever you want.
[4:40:47] <MainMan_Jonadiah> @Kataguro She'd probably be like "Man, fuck this Junko chick."
[4:40:49] <treemanfour> @peachsaliva If you beat the game only killing papyrus, nothing else, the kingdom burns down, and Sans calls you "A dirty brother killer"
[4:40:51] <FIame> LOOOL
[4:40:54] <Eresus> lol
[4:40:55] <%ziriken> LUL
[4:40:55] <%Cynful_Pleasures> @captainthunderwolf Yay! And I didn't even have to mention vore!
[4:40:55] <%AbnormalVoid> LUL
[4:40:56] <%Blain_Cooper> Dang ole Granpa is pretty cool
[4:40:57] <%Yumonikki> My high school teacher accepted bribes, as long we acknowledged that they didn't always work.
[4:40:58] <%edited156> Just like right nowwwwwwwwww
[4:41:01] <%KaiserRolled> pat the pee monster
[4:41:04] <%rugelachs> BITCH SAME HERE
[4:41:04] <mothdude> It's implied in phone calls that Sans gave Alphys the dog food to give to Endogeny.
[4:41:05] <%SvenHolgersson> CATS HAVE ARMS?!
[4:41:06] <Egoangell> Didnt she sit on pat on a bus?
[4:41:06] <Shade075> God what is happening in chat right now????
[4:41:06] <Grayhammatter> LUL
[4:41:07] <yosukecchi> yeah same!!
[4:41:07] <+StarkMaximum> I remember that video too!
[4:41:09] <Wistelligence> You know what game would be interesting for Paige to play? Rusty Lake Roots.
[4:41:11] <reonome> oh god i remember that shit
[4:41:11] <%Kataguro> Paige goes right to saying Junko's boobs are fake and that Sakura is big and strong
[4:41:13] <%LifesNeverHumDrum> SAME
[4:41:15] <+miscinsanity> it all comes full circle
[4:41:16] <%profanityincluded> FUCK HOMESTUCK
[4:41:18] <$CorruptDropbear> Two best friends play Homestuck
[4:41:19] <%captainthunderwolf> @Huntercd No, they just love fucking people who they pretend are kids. No chance of an overlap there. You can always trust people who fuck fake kids.
[4:41:19] <RubberFistFight> damnit I get all sadhappy when they talk about first finding elmo. Man, fuck the person who abandoned him.
[4:41:21] <Hunk_Of_Dunk> I REMEMBER THAT VIDEO
[4:41:21] <@Moobot> We're accepting fanfiction submissions, if you think you have a good one message a mod today!
[4:41:26] <SilentEric> Homestuck is great
[4:41:27] <Thirtine> Aww yeah that’s a good vid
[4:41:28] <serialtruant> what the fuck IS homestuck
[4:41:31] <+d00msdaydan> god i love that video
[4:41:33] <%Kataguro> Homestuck is the Heavy Rain of webcomics. Wasted potential is worse than no potential at all
[4:41:35] <%Solid_Seth> Originally, the bones in UI would kill you.
[4:41:38] <+UnitedWeGhost> wolskComfy
[4:41:38] <+ThatGuyfromMars> you also get a really sad phone call from papyrus if you kill everyone but him, he becomes captain of the royal guard but since nobody else is around, he doesn't have anyone to protect
[4:41:39] <%LifesNeverHumDrum> y'all made those "i warned you about the stairs bro" jokes for years, unkowing
[4:41:43] <$lotharrio> Be sure to actually read Kill Six Billion Demons. It's the best thing to come out of Homestuck.
[4:41:46] <%ziriken> is this anor lanstuck?
[4:41:48] <%breakfastmegapowers> Homestuck is Homestuck, I think I remember watching it
[4:41:50] <CactusChef3> what's the video called
[4:41:51] <thebeatsandrhymes> beneath the mask
[4:41:54] <%Bt_Robot> They should continue on their From Software adventures, DS2 must be destroyed by the Ruby Weapon
[4:41:55] <%babblingcabbage> beneath the mask from p5
[4:41:56] <+CluelessSniper> What video?
[4:41:59] <OkamiDude15> beneath the mask
[4:42:01] <$low_ver_zealous> I love DJ Cutman
[4:42:03] <thelovingfool> god act 6 is SO SHIT
[4:42:07] <$Agami23> thats how i found you guys too. best part about that video is all those sections are real.
[4:42:12] <%BunkusFreskie> under the mask
[4:42:18] <%LumberjackJack> BibleThump
[4:42:20] <$Mrdoctorprofessorhipster> It used to be Behind. Now its Beneath
[4:42:22] <%StridentSong> There's like 10 variants
[4:42:22] <+CaptainObnoxious> There are 93 ending in total.
[4:42:23] <@corn_on_fire> LUL captain of nothing
[4:42:30] <DesuDesuDokiDoki> thats some yandere shit
[4:42:35] <%krawtch> Papyrus lives but endures his own never ending hell in life
[4:42:39] <%davidsanchan> then it'd be Papyrus x alphys
[4:42:41] <Zeikier> the Alphys call ending is another great one
[4:42:44] <%Dakuu75> Aww... dude... don't depress me even more... i'm trying to fight my depression right now, yo... *tears up*
[4:42:47] <MissMalisin> BibleThump
[4:42:51] <%BunkusFreskie> there are over ten billion endings with each a slightly different color variant
[4:42:56] <%captainthunderwolf> @Cynful_Pleasures I consider loli more degenerate than vore because, like, that's a genuine substitute for pedophilia being used, but vore's... vore and guro are probably THE Level 10 "The Fuck You Doin'" fetishes.
[4:43:01] <%ssjklyco> He becomes Captiain of nothing either way.
[4:43:08] <Valkyrjsen> Why does a skeleton sweat? pvpS
[4:43:17] <%profanityincluded> HE WAS SWEATING. THREE. HOURS. AGO.
[4:43:18] <Futurecity10> I've been on 2x speed for the past 2 hours and now that I'm seeing pat play this normal speed and not 2x speed really makes a difference
[4:43:20] <MainMan_Jonadiah> CUZ IT'S JUST NESS IN A SKELETON MASK!!!!!
[4:43:35] <Railstone> @captainthunderwolf but at the same time, rather someone funnel that through cartoons than real people
[4:43:35] <%LifesNeverHumDrum> i dont think Pat's the one choking, in the bonezone
[4:43:39] <%krawtch> this game tries too hard, just ask me what color ending I want after 460 hours of gameplay across three $80 releases, like Mass Effect did.
[4:43:40] <%Djinnazz> @PeachSaliva That scene stop and go he does is you switching between fight the different Sans.
[4:43:43] <+Bupkis7> get boned on the bone throne in the bone zone
[4:43:47] <$lotharrio> With their skeletal sweat glands, duh. @ssjklyco
[4:43:49] <%reaped_psyche> My room mate's cat is also named Gizmo.
[4:43:50] <fireking900> Just got finish catching up with the vod, you got this pat
[4:43:50] <%breakfastmegapowers> My old kitten was named WoolSock
[4:43:54] <AlfredoCavatelli> Don't
[4:43:58] <+Massoverride> koolFLIRT
[4:44:00] <w4rl0ck3n> what's a homestuck?
[4:44:03] <@thenefftw> Oh no
[4:44:06] <BlacSoul> DANGEROUS
[4:44:06] <+NightOwlSam> oh no
[4:44:08] <@Moobot> YOU'RE BEING TOO LOUD! (QueequegTheater) (warning)
[4:44:12] <%BunkusFreskie> is Sans papyrus' dog?
[4:44:16] <%Marg0_Pol0> ctrl+F, Paige
[4:44:18] <vonmaultke> Whats a homestuck Jebaited
[4:44:19] <The_Blumper> WTF is homestuck
[4:44:19] <+cerberuscarmine> how can this be!
[4:44:22] <%QueequegTheater> Show your best friend your sock collection
[4:44:22] <@Moobot> Do you have a Fanfiction for Paige to read? Submit it to us here and it may get read on stream! http://bit.ly/2jsxJo9
[4:44:23] <Prevot> I've fallen for the best friends
[4:44:24] <%Dakuu75> "Gizmo" was the password for that nerd in the "Small Soldiers" movie or w/e that movie was called... I think it's something else in Ratchet and Clank series too
[4:44:26] <skybriel1> I think I saw someone ask what the video was called. It's "John and Dave play Sburb" if anybody cares
[4:44:28] <%QueequegTheater> Bitches love socks
[4:44:31] <%ssjklyco> @lotharrio I did not say that.
[4:44:36] <%captainthunderwolf> @Railstone Which seems like a nice ideal, but there's evidence of loli/shota porn not only being used to groom children, but also of it bringing out traits of pedophilia in latent pedophiles. It's just a paraphilia; it goes away if you ignore it instead of feeding it.
[4:44:38] <wsintai> Just dont have any friends, easy
[4:44:41] <%BunkusFreskie> don't fall for best friend, literally m o v e o n
[4:44:50] <%waddledoops> OK so i just booted up undertale for the first time and i named my character FRISK because i thought that was the characters name and now im learning that this was a mistake
[4:44:50] <+CaptainObnoxious> People theorize he's not actually a skeleton as when is hit he also appears to bleed. Game theory did a video theorizing that sans is the pc in toby's halloween hack of mother/earthbound
[4:44:59] <FeverPitch17> There's an ending where you kill nearly everyone but Alphys and she states that she should have killed you herself.
[4:45:02] <Personified134> the proper advise is -do not-
[4:45:02] <%Ralfclogs> cheer100 your in a relationship with A super best friend
[4:45:03] <DesuDesuDokiDoki> go for it
[4:45:06] <Sokumotanaka> Yeah I fell for mine and she doesn't see anything in me and that sucks
[4:45:15] <Habblewater> asking the question means you already shouldn't
[4:45:16] <%BunkusFreskie> just tell them in a chill way
[4:45:19] <%Djinnazz> don't
[4:45:23] <+ThePayphone> its not shown in most trivia sections but W.D gaster is actually found to be a direct reference to Obama
[4:45:26] <%captainthunderwolf> Dating best friend is a very, very all-or-nothing proposition.
[4:45:29] <MissMalisin> Sounds like a bad time
[4:45:29] <CatYamHD> he lost a sweat drop
[4:45:31] <%ssjklyco> Do nothing and sabotage all their other relationships from the shadows
[4:45:33] <%captainthunderwolf> Things either go very well or terribly.
[4:45:34] <Dethhollow> Talk to them and maybe feel things out, but if they're into someone then you'll have to make a rough call
[4:45:36] <OkamiDude15> @CaptainObnoxious which toby immediately shot down by saying there was no connection between the two
[4:45:36] <%babblingcabbage> Then use the love potion
[4:45:42] <%Admiral_PopnFresh> eh, she's roight
[4:45:43] <%dotta5> Roofie
[4:45:46] <Valkyrjsen> I just realized it's been like 2 hours of Pat fighting Sans and Paige hasn't stopped talking for a single second. She's gonna sleep like a baby tonight. LUL
[4:45:46] <%BunkusFreskie> important question: is this gay? if so do it.
[4:45:48] <ghost_teeth> Just wait until you're knock out drunk and make a terrible mistake : )
[4:45:48] <%dalmek> Use the roofie elixir
[4:45:49] <%lil_potayto> Strange Magic?
[4:45:54] <$CorruptDropbear> PIE TIME
[4:45:54] <%NWR_James> @PeachSaliva spray a love potion in her eyes
[4:45:57] <@thenefftw> Throw the roofie potion in their face
[4:45:58] <%breakfastmegapowers> Friends with Benefits is a happy middle ground
[4:45:59] <%Dakuu75> @FeverPitch17 does Alphys explain HOW she had the ability to kill you?
[4:45:59] <%babblingcabbage> sipsipGasm sipsipGasm sipsipGasm
[4:46:00] <%Keyd00d> PIE TIME
[4:46:01] <%Yumonikki> PogChamp
[4:46:03] <%SvenHolgersson> ROOFIES YOU SAY?!
[4:46:03] <KoyaMusa> remember to masturbate before you ask her
[4:46:04] <Bncbck> yeah just do what paige suggested and roofie her
[4:46:09] <%ssjklyco> Love and potions are just chemicals
[4:46:12] <$lotharrio> Love potion number 8?!
[4:46:12] <+LazyRabb1t> wy no pi
[4:46:13] <CatmanIX> all I know about homestuck is from some guy who spontaneously started forcing hs roleplay on me and got pissed off when I had no idea wtf he was doing, then banned me from the very much not homestuck related irc channel he was a mod of. can't say I've ever had any interest in it after that
[4:46:16] <+Bupkis7> sleep on it. it actually helps me sometimes
[4:46:16] <MainMan_Jonadiah> Everyone, give Pat your energy! Your anger!! Your EVERYTHING!!!
[4:46:16] <%SvenHolgersson> THANKS MR. COSBY
[4:46:18] <%profanityincluded> use your +1 sword of forced entry
[4:46:21] <%Keyd00d> IT'S TIME
[4:46:22] <%Admiral_PopnFresh> friendship is more important, and awkwardness can kill friendly feelings
[4:46:23] <%fangdsniper2nd> So close

[4:49:12] <%StridentSong> @PeachSaliva There's roughly a heart and a half area that you can constantly move in a circle, and not get hit. It's tight, but the path is there. Be ready for just a little bit more after the rotation

[4:50:09] <%GeneralSCPatton> NIHILISM
[4:50:10] <$thesounddefense> maybe sans figured you had ot covered
[4:50:10] <%fangdsniper2nd> He knew you could take him
[4:50:14] <%Dakuu75> Well, I think at that point... Flowy is more powerfull
[4:50:15] <AristoMercu> sleep
[4:50:15] <%StridentSong> Sans doesn't fuck him up because he knows you have it
[4:50:17] <%Djinnazz> flowey had comtroll of the game at that point.
[4:50:18] <mothdude> Sans is too weak. Only does 1 damage.
[4:50:21] <%fangdsniper2nd> OR he was affraid that he'd lose his 1 hp
[4:50:25] <$lotharrio> Flowey wasn't able to break through the barrier.
[4:50:25] <@Moobot> Do you have a Fanfiction for Paige to read? Submit it to us here and it may get read on stream! http://bit.ly/2jsxJo9
[4:50:25] <%im_just_shiny> @PeachSaliva Hi. Watching the stream from the NBC broadcast center in ny. Y'all are making overnights worthwhile.
[4:50:27] <%Beerswithbears> cheer 100 bork bork (its ok im swedish)
[4:50:29] <CynBurn> Sans was distracted by Toriel
[4:50:32] <%ziriken> Sans has Star Platinum, while Flowey has Za Warudo
[4:50:32] <+Dasbubba> He has one hp and was laready grabbed.
[4:50:34] <AlfredoCavatelli> or he absorbed the human souls to do this
[4:50:34] <+trnzero> Would KR work on Flowey if he didnt kill anyone in this timeline?
[4:50:36] <+StarkMaximum> "It'll be FIIIIIINE." -Sans, prolly
[4:50:40] <$Mrdoctorprofessorhipster> He fell asleep
[4:50:40] <ImperfectWeapons> Flowey says Sans has fucked his shit up multiple times.
[4:50:43] <%Beerswithbears> cheer100 bork bork (its ok im swedish)
[4:50:44] <Sokumotanaka> There's a comic about that shit too
[4:50:46] <%rugelachs> oh jesus
[4:50:48] <%salty_syd913> OH
[4:50:49] <+NightOwlSam> bad feels
[4:50:52] <CurrySauseBandit> There's a reason he's in a hallway. He can't be surprised from there.
[4:50:53] <Dragon_Batman> ow
[4:50:53] <%babblingcabbage> Whens the Papyrus emote
[4:50:57] <topendbuzz> he does care
[4:50:57] <iambqb> There's a fan comic where he says something along the lines of, "My powers don't work against time travelers," Eyes go dark, "But you already knew that didn't you."
[4:51:05] <%edited156> Jesus christ dude
[4:51:13] <%krawtch> swedish women are great because they are mostly 7s or higher but have really low standards BrokeBack
[4:51:16] <$autismweaponised> The fuck is Sweden
[4:51:18] <%Freelance7> I don't think that should ever be attempted
[4:51:18] <+ThatGuyfromMars> thats a lot of walking

[4:51:28] <KaiserMario> Just run 7 min a week and you're good
[4:51:35] <HypemasterMonty> Because he's lazy too, and sees no point to saving anything becaise he knwos it will all reset anyways. The only reason he fights you here is because he is the LAST thing standing between you and a vicious circle of suffering for everyone in the whole damn world.
[4:51:38] <%captainthunderwolf> @autismweaponised It's like Australia with taller people and a shadow government
[4:51:44] <Dethhollow> This fees like the run

[4:51:59] <+axebird> Holy shit this is still happening
[4:52:00] <suhmguy> Sans only gets worried if you are killing the timeline itself. He is not worried about any one particular playthrough because he knows it will be reset.
[4:52:00] <+CluelessSniper> Kirin sucks
[4:52:02] <%superc37> fuck off bayos a top coward
[4:52:06] <Huntercd> Bayo is a Domme

[4:52:12] <%KaiserRolled> lionDongers
[4:52:17] <SilentEric> @PeachSaliva You should have made a copy of the game files before starting the Genocide route. You can (in game canon) keep a happy ending from resetting.

[4:59:36] <%Bt_Robot> C'mon, this is a Christian stream.
[4:59:36] <+FrostedZaibatsu> This is twitch man, we come for games dude.
[4:59:40] <%BunkusFreskie> like these done to me many times
[4:59:42] <heytakeiteasyterry> @peachsaliva I work at McDonald's
[4:59:43] <+frobeards> btw $15 papyrus body pillow is literally the first search result on google
[4:59:47] <Mexrage> if you want foot fetish, that's clemps terrirory
[4:59:49] <%breakfastmegapowers> Just photoshop feet rubbing together on her legs and hands
[4:59:53] <%krawtch> where does that rank on the creep scale? somewhere between tumblr user and saudi oil prince?
[4:59:57] <%HotBloodedHero> They've never been up this late.
[5:00:01] <time_axis> tfw can't fastforward to the victory
[5:00:05] <Baron_von_Turkeyfish> same
[5:00:07] <Wistelligence> Paige, if you're gonna do degenerate foot stuff, at least hold out for triple digits.
[5:00:08] <%HotBloodedHero> I would be watching the VOD by now.
[5:00:13] <Benpower236> Its 4 am. I believe in you so that I may go to bed Pat.
[5:00:17] <$lotharrio> Paige looks at Pat: Yeah... Fuck THAT guy. Then she licks her lips and- stuff I can't keep typing happens.
[5:00:22] <%BunkusFreskie> I'm upset I can't skip to when pat wins
[5:00:23] <Habblewater> Yeah you told them to rub feet together
[5:00:24] <%AbnormalVoid> these have to be jokes now rofl
[5:00:27] <%SvenHolgersson> Paige steals from the homeless confirmed
[5:00:32] <SilvanSagevale> Holy fuck this one boss s gonna be longer than all the VODs combined
[5:00:46] <Idon__> Bunless Burgers, what the FUCK has this world come to.
[5:00:51] <%ssjklyco> Just tell them Protein style
[5:00:53] <Graxe_> And then they give Paige only buns when she orders.
[5:00:53] <%LifesNeverHumDrum> srsly. they're happy to save the bun for another burger
[5:00:56] <Klefth> At that point, why not just order meat? LUL
[5:00:56] <serrishtar> im glad i caught this live cause i would be too tempted to skip to the end and miss all the cameradie in suffering
[5:01:06] <%ziriken> Was
[5:01:07] <+MechaBaphomet> @PeachSaliva They put the patty in a nugget box
[5:01:08] <MainMan_Jonadiah> Papyrus has GIRTH, but Sans has the SKILL
[5:01:09] <%krawtch> bunless burger? you mean salisbury steak
[5:01:09] <%Kataguro> Very proud of his brother's massive bone
[5:01:11] <treemanfour> "was"
[5:01:13] <%davidsanchan> big boned
[5:01:17] <%TheGershon> Is it true that Pat could get better healing items from Burgerpants? I saw that earlier
[5:01:17] <KoyaMusa> nah that's ntr
[5:01:17] <+dontbethinkingthat> OH MAN SHE READ MY MESSAGE. I'm half awake right now and her reading it made me thought I was dreaming lol
[5:01:18] <DesuDesuDokiDoki> NTR
[5:01:24] <DagetSparrow> Sans levelled Dex
[5:01:26] <MrPlush> NTR
[5:01:27] <gyrogogozeppeli> NTR Asgore

[5:01:34] <+NightOwlSam> heall
[5:01:34] <%WillowMelody> @TheGershon Yeah I tried mentioning it a few times and they haven't noticed.
[5:01:36] <sjcodan> HEEEEAL
[5:01:38] <topendbuzz> feelssdgoreman
[5:01:38] <+StarkMaximum> So Undertale lore nerds, what's Sans' end-game here? He knows every time you lose you just come back, right? So is his goal to just win every single time and keep you locked in this cycle forever?
[5:01:41] <+FrostedZaibatsu> OTP?
[5:01:41] <stigna1> You can't just force other people into dares, lol.
[5:01:50] <%WillowMelody> @StarkMaximum Make you rage quit so you don't try again.
[5:01:52] <+other_badger> TIMINGUH
[5:01:53] <%Kataguro> Pat is really getting it
[5:01:54] <%breakfastmegapowers> Papyrus has a Cool Dude move, of course Sans is proud
[5:01:56] <Mr_tonsu> Sans is just a Dex build
[5:01:57] <%deadlypartition> got there
[5:01:58] <%Mornaka> MY HEART MAN
[5:01:58] <jokisilent> one hp run
[5:01:59] <%StridentSong> Sans is banking on you giving up and never coming back
[5:02:00] <$autismweaponised> nah he would die, Dwarves are resistant to poison
[5:02:01] <Kghaleon> I think this battle is far worse than a pepper.
[5:02:02] <@thenefftw> @StarkMaximum He's trying to make you rage quit
[5:02:03] <CatmanIX> OTP = on true pairing
[5:02:06] <%LifesNeverHumDrum> technically the SBURB thing led an Ex to you guys, who in turn led me to you
[5:02:07] <eco419> nice
[5:02:09] <0_hina_0> Wow ballsy
[5:02:14] <%captainthunderwolf> @StarkMaximum He wants you to give up and never start again.
[5:02:14] <taritari> Sans just wants you to get sick and quit playing
[5:02:17] <+pkmamsters> kagoora
[5:02:19] <CynBurn> @MechaBaphomet Not necessarily. That's only if it has no toppings as well. If it still has toppings it's in a side salad bowl.
[5:02:20] <%KaiserRolled> cirGasm
[5:02:20] <kingra> Why is pat using lesser healing items
[5:02:22] <%Yumonikki> PogChamp
[5:02:22] <%ziriken> senRan kaGoora
[5:02:23] <+wingblade7> how is Pat so chill?
[5:02:23] <aeonicvector> @StarkMaximum The idea is either you rage quit, he loses and couldnt have won, or atleast he slows you down
[5:02:23] <cj_art> hikage best girl
[5:02:23] <MissMalisin> moon2L
[5:02:24] <@corn_on_fire> she's so good PogChamp she's playing with her MIND
[5:02:27] <%davidsanchan> the plot thickens
[5:02:27] <%SvenHolgersson> don't forget butts
[5:02:30] <%ziriken> Clipped
[5:02:32] <+0samura1> @starkmaximum to kill ur determination so u dont have the will to try again
[5:02:34] <Sitinomi> I just noticed Elmo's eyes are closed. He so sweet
[5:02:34] <@Moobot> Do you have a Fanfiction for Paige to read? Submit it to us here and it may get read on stream! http://bit.ly/2jsxJo9
[5:02:35] <+Seddaz> Jesus christ it's 8am here in England and you're still playing? Time to watch from the start

[5:02:45] <fireking900> IT REAL TO ME DAMNIT
[5:02:45] <%deadlypartition> ༼ つ ◕_◕ ༽つ pat take my energy ༼ つ ◕_◕ ༽つ
[5:02:48] <Dethhollow> Anime is real, dangit!
[5:02:49] <%krawtch> thats like asking Pat if he wants to drink a steak while hes eating a steak.
[5:02:52] <%BunkusFreskie> yes! next game is tiddy game!!!
[5:02:52] <Prevot> THEY'RE REAL TO ME GODDAMMIT
[5:02:55] <Wistelligence> Newgrounds hentai games are the game equivalent of shitty fanfic.
[5:02:55] <Damashi_The_Kaotic> I feel like the 2nd phase is less hard aside from the final attack.
[5:02:55] <SolitudeOtM> Preeeeetty sure "PLOT" is ass lol
[5:02:56] <baronvonkame> paige isnt a real gamer if she doesnt play hatoful boyfriend
[5:02:56] <+TheShal> Isn't it banned on Twitch?
[5:03:00] <DrakeSilvos> Might as well play Gal*Gun.
[5:03:01] <%profanityincluded> 9am lads WW@
[5:03:02] <Benpower236> Fake anime boobs are like the second best kind!
[5:03:02] <$TheSniperJoe> Paige plays the Muv-Luv trilogy.
[5:03:03] <Shade075> But this game said they are REAL
[5:03:16] <SilvanSagevale> Toriel's a bitch
[5:03:16] <MainMan_Jonadiah> @SolitudeOtM If you're a dirty brony, maybe.
[5:03:20] <%rugelachs> sipsipElmo sipsipElmo sipsipElmo
[5:03:21] <%Yumonikki> sipsipElmo sipsipElmo sipsipElmo sipsipElmo sipsipElmo
[5:03:21] <fgosadhana> Yes paige play muv luv
[5:03:22] <%profanityincluded> Fake anime books are better than real fake boobs
[5:03:24] <Sokumotanaka> Play breath of fire3/4 Idk why I'm just suggesting it
[5:03:30] <yodajr99> pat don't choke
[5:03:30] <$lotharrio> Here we go...
[5:03:31] <%profanityincluded> play Song of Saya tho
[5:03:39] <+StarkMaximum> Everyone who answered my question: I guess that does make more sense, thanks nerds. (I say nerds with the utmost respect.)
[5:03:52] <%Ralfclogs> sipsipElmo sipsipElmo sipsipElmo sipsipElmo sipsipElmo
[5:03:54] <$ImasukyLomae> I liked you from the start

[5:04:03] <DesuDesuDokiDoki> AND ACT
[5:04:03] <%KaiserRolled> cirHonk
[5:04:04] <%babblingcabbage> sipsipHonk sipsipHonk sipsipHonk
[5:04:04] <%BunkusFreskie> same
[5:04:05] <%ssjklyco> The idea of "I don't like this channel, I will keep watching" is a bit odd.
[5:04:07] <SodiumChloride2Tough> Character progression.
[5:04:08] <ape_hawk> no youre stuck up because of the good titty
[5:04:08] <serialtruant> you mean paige isn't snotty?
[5:04:09] <Triplicat> rekt
[5:04:11] <+AXL808> turns out she's super weird and friendly
[5:04:11] <%edited156> Paige really won me over when she convinced Pat to show us his burrito method of sleeping.
[5:04:11] <MONSTRx_x> and feel
[5:04:14] <+ThePayphone> guys, what if during san's ultimate attack, paige moved the mouse cursor onto the screen?
[5:04:14] <%Intolerable> sipsipRude
[5:04:15] <Everpresent_Overseer> Synuses
[5:04:16] <stigna1> @PeachSaliva So, Sans seems to have some access to "shortcuts" (remember all those times we walked off screen into a solid wall?). That seems to be what's going down during his pre-special attack, heart-dropping thing (all those them sanses)
[5:04:17] <0_hina_0> Honk
[5:04:17] <%krawtch> then they see you eating mustard out of an old coconut water cap
[5:04:19] <bryanmildew> there was one stream where paige really fuckin annoyed me but i'm still here
[5:04:26] <misterspotswood> should i go to bed or keep watching and drawing lewds?
[5:04:27] <+Hamblasto> She's a bitch, but she's a big, weird bitch
[5:04:30] <Mexrage> my first exposure to paige was on the clemps podcast, so i had a very good first impression of you @PeachSaliva
[5:04:30] <heytakeiteasyterry> @plagueofgripes @peachsaliva @angriestpat you guys should stream together and pat and plague talk smack during warframe stream and plague is handsome
[5:04:33] <%captainthunderwolf> Full of titty.
[5:04:34] <+axebird> Full of titty, apparently
[5:04:58] <%Bt_Robot> More that she acts like a clone of Asuka
[5:05:05] <Klefth> And he calls you a "dirty brother killer" @PeachSaliva
[5:05:05] <MissMalisin> Spooky
[5:05:06] <DrakeSilvos> yeah
[5:05:09] <AncelDeLambert> Pat has been destroyed due to titty
[5:05:11] <+Hilleltaco> @PeachSaliva He calls you a dirty brother killer, specifically
[5:05:12] <Marhunter7> @PeachSaliva wow yall are still up? how has sleep deprivation craziness not set in yet?

[5:05:37] <$lotharrio> All Americans love Labradors. It's proven via political sciences. Also, the implication is that every reload from a save is a different reality that you're loading into.
[5:05:37] <%ziriken> is that a lot?
[5:05:39] <%ssjklyco> Get ready to eat that pepper
