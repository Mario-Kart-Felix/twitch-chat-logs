[0:54:26] <+Mekhet09> Paige has bad armor for this. There's literally no reason to use heavy armor in this game.
[0:54:30] <SulfurousAcid> GREEDO
[0:54:32] <%DesertPenguin> You can always put the game in EASY MODE by summoning help

[0:54:47] <defaultname3887> @andriestpat you should explain paige the gargoyles spawn by health to paige
[0:54:47] <%deltakuma009> stick and move
[0:54:49] <Niney_Who> You aren't FACING HIM
[0:54:50] <someyounguy1> this fight might be easier without locking on

[0:54:52] <$Solidnick18> stuck
[0:54:54] <Valdorick> Fuckbox

[0:54:57] <+cvp5127> corner again
[0:54:59] <alwayspronking> that was good tho
[0:54:59] <dapperskeleton69> CORNER TRAPS
[0:54:59] <%Lion_kun> Paige, stop putting yourself in a corner
[0:55:00] <fruit_pie_the_magician> You can only get the full red aura bonus to the Curved Nil Greatsword by getting to like NG+7
[0:55:01] <Niney_Who> @PeachSaliva Stop locking on and backing into a corner
[0:55:01] <%DesertPenguin> He did explain the health thing
[0:55:01] <+OwlLightningMage> SUN BIG DOWN
[0:55:02] <SumKnowBuddy> aaaaand in the corner again
[0:55:03] <spiritofmojave> The corner is getting ya must these times
[0:55:04] <LokimenD> Back into the corner
[0:55:05] <+Pookiedaexzile> NOT THE CORNER
[0:55:06] <Zantetzuken> FailFish
[0:55:06] <%emoonimoo> Move like a butterfly, sting like a bee, Paige!
[0:55:07] <%UrielCobalt> Don't Lock-On
[0:55:07] <InugamiTheHound> could the lock-on be hurting more than helping? Her weapons is too slow and to long
[0:55:08] <%skizzuto> Pat tell Paige she shouldn't bother with locking on in this fight
[0:55:08] <romanticzomedy> you can move around the whole arena to bait one to follow~
[0:55:11] <%wolfofsound> Nobody puts Paige in a corner..........except Paige
[0:55:11] <%NaturalGear> is it perhaps time for shield?
[0:55:12] <%Klefth> 1-hand for wider swings, maybe?
[0:55:12] <peachy996> Paige, treat this like the Shadows of Yharnam
[0:55:13] <$i_am_therydon> paige loves the corner.
[0:55:13] <CurrySauseBandit> @peachsaliva Try not targetting
[0:55:14] <rubbishbinge> how can this b
[0:55:14] <+ChaosAethr> Stop going to the corner
[0:55:14] <+jphengstler> stop trying to hit them and hit them!
[0:55:15] <%Lion_kun> You can do it, just don't stay in the corner
[0:55:16] <+dante_must_die_exe> Paige with the laser focus
[0:55:18] <$Solidnick18> safety corner
[0:55:18] <spiritofmojave> Except gargoyles
[0:55:19] <Sphincter_Spelunker> except Paige
[0:55:22] <TheWinged7> do you have a blunt weapon? maybe try that due extra damage
[0:55:22] <Niney_Who> If there's more than 2, don't lock on
[0:55:23] <+TheShal> Paige puts DSPaige in the corner.
[0:55:25] <Artugoesblank> i thought Paige loved bottom.
[0:55:25] <+SaurianCrash> the lock on could not be helping
[0:55:26] <nip_nips> paige could find the corner in a round room
[0:55:26] <$lotharrio> Paigey puts Paigey in a corner.
[0:55:28] <adayuman> gargoyles put paigey in a corner
[0:55:29] <Tucker0603> @peachsaliva the gargoyles are health percentage based not time or proximity
[0:55:32] <%boomstickery> @PeachSaliva you an inspiration, anthing wrong an ispiration do s is just more inspiring
[0:55:36] <Sunstalker> Do a circle around the bosszone to kite them
[0:55:39] <%freightl0rd> No paige you wanna one hand for pvp

[1:01:29] <Shion963> Paige you have three swings. Three swings, three swings, three swings. And that's IT.
[1:01:30] <rubbishbinge> if you give paige enough stamina to roll away from danger she'll use it to roll into double danger
[1:01:30] <geoffster999> she should pump invasions for to upgrade her sword

[1:02:39] <%umbypokochan> you just have to get angry enough to win
[1:02:41] <CurrySauseBandit> Not locking on works for me. But everyone handles camera differently.
[1:02:42] <SpaceGuntank> Never give up Paige, you can do it! we believe in you!
[1:02:44] <+nathandiel> I don’t get the hype over Dark Souls
[1:02:44] <+Grayhammatter> buckle up buckaroos
[1:02:44] <FirearmsInstructor> @PeachSaliva Only swing one or two times. NEVER 3.
[1:02:45] <TheWinged7> get mad, burn their house down with lemons
[1:02:46] <+cdrom321> Locking on becomes a problem when they fly up.
[1:02:47] <peachy996> It's not a race to the finish Paige, don't worry
[1:02:47] <Artugoesblank> my personal advice is to relax, focus on one, have fun.
[1:02:48] <romanticzomedy> not locking on would help i think too
[1:02:50] <+patriotrenegade> Throne Watcher and Throne Defender
[1:02:51] <$Solidnick18> ugh
[1:02:52] <+OwlLightningMage> This fight isn't that hard. You keep getting greedy
[1:02:52] <DeadpanSoupcan> thats why theres so many symmons
[1:02:53] <SomeSageAdvice> Let go of the lock-on when they fly up, then go right beneath them to avoid the fire
[1:02:53] <bigbrothergannon> seat buckled
[1:02:54] <Niney_Who> Try not locking on
[1:02:55] <Finakala> Ruin Sentinels were the first
[1:02:57] <$i_am_therydon> grind for souls. pump strength.
[1:02:57] <+greyestfox> are the rings and armour optimized for fire defense and big damage?
[1:02:59] <+Mekhet09> This place sucks for certain builds
[1:03:00] <+OwlLightningMage> O and S sucks
[1:03:04] <%MeMillionthDollar> ruin sentinels was first
[1:03:04] <derekwst3> @PeachSaliva you are going to get it this round im also a time traveler
[1:03:06] <+JenovasPuppet> Give Paige your energy
[1:03:06] <%SolverCODO> Royal Gargoyle authority
[1:03:07] <WorldFapRevealed> whos the guy talking? sounds like he probably has bad opinions
[1:03:09] <%MeMillionthDollar> wow pats wrong
[1:03:11] <+Mekhet09> Slowrollwing is bad for this area.
[1:03:11] <CandyCoatedConfection> this isn't even a main boss though? why can't she do something else?
[1:03:12] <TheChillRoom> Generally, locking on with the ultragreat swords was not the strat back when this game was new. It's been a while for me though
[1:03:12] <+robobeau> +1 for stop locking on
[1:03:16] <DracaenaLeaf> bet she didn't hear that one
[1:03:18] <TheHeroAppears> the lock on doesn't seem to be helping you, since you constantly adjust your swings with movement anyway
[1:03:22] <+demon1103> DS2 logic, ya know whats hard, being constantly outnumbered
[1:03:24] <+JenovasPuppet> Still hit it!
[1:03:25] <+mh9s> sleady
[1:03:31] <DracaenaLeaf> ooh she did cool
[1:03:32] <+OwlLightningMage> All the multi boss fights suck except Watchers because they fight each other
[1:03:32] <Artugoesblank> back down whenever you can, there is no timer here .
[1:03:32] <vessel0souls> Keep throwing your self at a brick wall and eventually it will break
[1:03:32] <+jphengstler> Paige has no idea what O and S is. she said yes for no reason
[1:03:48] <%DesertPenguin> But you face the gargoyles in DS1 before O & S so that's really your first introduction to a multi-boss fight
[1:03:49] <Zombrocom> Honestly, the key to this fight is patience. Just strafing until you get a safe moment, and hitting then once or twice
[1:03:50] <%Scevda> Yep @jphengstler
[1:03:51] <vessel0souls> that's dark souls in a nut shell
[1:03:56] <Kalcom> 2 bosses=good
[1:03:57] <TheWinged7> 4
[1:03:59] <Niney_Who> You didn't kill any
[1:03:59] <Kropar3> you can't do this slow and steadym you'll get 5 gargoyles on you that way
[1:04:00] <DracaenaLeaf> you lasted longer it feels like
[1:04:00] <+JenovasPuppet> Wombo combo'd
[1:04:01] <InugamiTheHound> f
[1:04:01] <Exadata_> don´t dodge to run away, then you wont have the stamina to doge to avoid attacks
[1:04:01] <Shion963> monster Hunter mode
[1:04:02] <Kalcom> 3 bosses=death
[1:04:02] <dapperskeleton69> cwispy
[1:04:02] <ittla> this boss is so lame
[1:04:03] <%boomstickery> locking on not a bad thing
[1:04:03] <%thejimjamz> Peach! Stay Determined!
[1:04:03] <Niney_Who> You just mortally wounded 3
[1:04:04] <%Shonen_hero> gotta focus on just one Paige
[1:04:05] <+ClaudeMcGarren> FailFish
[1:04:07] <+VashyronM> @PeachSaliva Swing once and run
[1:04:07] <trianglehat> keep spreading damage
[1:04:08] <+cdrom321> I beat these guys yesterday because I summoned. Am I a coward or did I win?
[1:04:08] <Etherealizer> try learning without lock on and one handing it you'll have a lot easier time once you get used to it
[1:04:08] <+emperordread> Pick one and bully it
[1:04:09] <Zantetzuken> work the camera
[1:04:09] <+AntithesisEK> lock on is pretty not ideal for GS anyway
[1:04:11] <Monkeyweed21> stop eating hits and focus on 1 at a time
[1:04:11] <%depressed_skeleton> numbers hard
[1:04:11] <+Leon_Spencer> you love to trade
[1:04:12] <Artugoesblank> it's a learning curve dear Paige c:
[1:04:12] <honeyman18> you can do it Paige, use the power of apatBig stong
[1:04:14] <+Cn_alpha_02> focus on 1
[1:04:14] <TheWinged7> pick just one and kill it
[1:04:17] <vessel0souls> Try a sheild and turtle might help
[1:04:17] <valriot> To be fair, this game is stupid LUL
[1:04:18] <%Lion_kun> Paige jsut be patient
[1:04:19] <Djinnazz> bad at this? yes.
[1:04:19] <%DesertPenguin> Honestly, try a shield?
[1:04:19] <bigbrothergannon> you need to breath and count
[1:04:19] <Niney_Who> Then Walk away from it
[1:04:19] <derekwst3> swing once and run away
[1:04:19] <+OwlLightningMage> The sun is down
[1:04:20] <trianglehat> focus Paige
[1:04:20] <lethallylactic> Kreygasm
[1:04:22] <romanticzomedy> Only hit them once
[1:04:22] <cintra212> At this point Id say just summon
[1:04:23] <Monkeyweed21> thats the point of the boss
[1:04:24] <Niney_Who> Space yourself
[1:04:25] <%boomstickery> yo9u onl
[1:04:26] <TheWinged7> just like Sunday nights
[1:04:26] <krymzen5> right up in there
[1:04:27] <romanticzomedy> Hit once, roll. Hit once, roll.
[1:04:27] <$i_am_therydon> ignore it then
[1:04:27] <+Grayhammatter> LUL
[1:04:27] <peachy996> Your weapon is the big sucks
[1:04:28] <$StaceMcGate> "KnowhatImean?"
[1:04:29] <FirearmsInstructor> THAT'S RAD!
[1:04:29] <SomeSageAdvice> try to keep both in your view, if they start ganging up on you, switch to the opposite side so they're kiting
[1:04:29] <Amardeux> you need to focus on dodging
[1:04:29] <+patriotrenegade> HELL YEAH I DO
[1:04:29] <+BisoromiBear> drill your i-frames into your muscle memory
[1:04:30] <SumKnowBuddy> LUL
[1:04:31] <jemeralddragoon> @pat just let Paige go somewhere else. This is getting boring
[1:04:31] <KaiYuuta> Shove it in their asses instead.
[1:04:32] <Artugoesblank> you gotta get ass handled before your balls get bigger.
[1:04:33] <%BallerSwagBro9k> @datasuna LUL
[1:04:34] <Finakala> Do you have cute feet beep beep
[1:04:34] <dapperskeleton69> big gargoyle kog
[1:04:35] <%SpoonlessAlakazam> Is this the stream where we finally abandon this stupid weapon? PogChamp
[1:04:35] <Shion963> insistence in using Big Strong in DSII
[1:04:35] <ScatterCatt> When you go to the other end of the rooftop, you're letting both of them come in and charge you together. Just go at the first one and focus him down.
[1:04:35] <%g0atmeal> start fight by first one
[1:04:36] <%Shadowpint> I think this boss is really unfun
[1:04:37] <+JenovasPuppet> Try not locking on from the start
[1:04:37] <%walternatorz> just try dodging for the next fight and learn when to attack
[1:04:38] <+demon1103> 2 boss is good ONCE, after that its just annoying
[1:04:38] <SulfurousAcid> their hits have right of way not yours
[1:04:39] <+Pookiedaexzile> BIG STRONG
[1:04:39] <%KingGoblodyte> Stay locked on WEAKEST target, stick and move
[1:04:40] <%Scevda> Hawt
[1:04:41] <ittla> this boss is one of those "what if we put a bunch of them because dark soul hard haha"
[1:04:41] <Valdorick> You are big, you are strong, SHOW FEET
[1:04:43] <Zeemod155> So don't attack ANYTHING until you can 100% guarantee 1 of them is isolated
[1:04:44] <DatAsuna> @BallerSwagBro9k nice bone fist
[1:04:45] <Niney_Who> MACE
[1:04:46] <$Solidnick18> no worries this boss sucked the first time around
[1:04:46] <+Mekhet09> Your weapon and armor make you to slow to deal with the boss.
[1:04:47] <SpaceGuntank> Paige is the biggest and strongest
[1:04:49] <+jphengstler> you're not rolling and you're activating all of them by not focusing on one at a time
[1:04:50] <+Leon_Spencer> Stop Trading
[1:04:51] <%SeniorBLT> why does disney + not have indiana jones?
[1:04:52] <DatAsuna> @BallerSwagBro9k power stance two of them tho
[1:04:53] <Niney_Who> or HEAVY ARMOR
[1:04:53] <derekwst3> clent your butt, it wont be up your ass
[1:04:54] <+Mr_Pylon> Try hitting ONE gargoyle ONCE, and then backing off
[1:04:56] <DeadpanSoupcan> get a summon
[1:04:56] <$StaceMcGate> Did Paige struggle as much in Bloodborne?
[1:04:56] <+OwlLightningMage> You are weak and little when the sun is down
[1:05:00] <+patriotrenegade> @PeachSaliva Pat, why dont you have her finish off Heide's Tower of Flame?
[1:05:04] <TheHeroAppears> the only problem with not locking on with Paige is that she then also has to control the camera which might be too much
[1:05:05] <Firestone12332> gotta be patient! @peachsaliva
[1:05:05] <%Lion_kun> Paige minimal defens eisn't going to help
[1:05:08] <+Grayhammatter> BONE crown
[1:05:08] <+SaurianCrash> ok how about this, instead Paige should hit one, then run away to the wall let them follow, hit them then run away and repeat V:
[1:05:10] <%SeniorBLT> Focus on one
[1:05:11] <+McBubbles07> @McBubbles07 is new here. Say hello! HeyGuys
[1:05:15] <studleydoorite> always retreat when within range of two or more @PeachSaliva
[1:05:16] <Amardeux> yeah slow weapons are a pain against bosses that don't stagger
[1:05:17] <Equirah> maybe GS isn't her weapon?
[1:05:18] <+cdrom321> @patriotrenegade Good point.
[1:05:20] <Prism_Wing> wear the poison shit
[1:05:22] <+ArmoredDeath> hggGuapo hi
[1:05:25] <SulfurousAcid> Boss swings will stun you, you will not stun them

[1:05:51] <Artugoesblank> Might aswell die pretty.
[1:05:55] <Niney_Who> I will always vouch for Paige to use Mace and Shield
[1:06:00] <Niney_Who> It's the bread and butter
[1:06:00] <Amardeux> @peachsaliva your swings don't stagger the gargoyles
[1:06:01] <+LuchaDePucha> its all about fashion souls
[1:06:05] <Finakala> Mace is honestly super good
[1:06:06] <KaiYuuta> Eat and effigy and get the tanky bro.
[1:06:06] <Sunstalker> Pat, it's about the poison aura
[1:06:07] <+Pookiedaexzile> But you'll be fly
[1:06:08] <InugamiTheHound> she attacks them in the air. Only attack when they are on the ground only
[1:06:15] <+cdrom321> @Queequag was rocking butterfly and duel grand lances.

[1:07:49] <$i_am_therydon> you locked on.
[1:07:50] <IronGlorfindel> if it takes 5 swings anyway, one-handing it to hit several at a time could be good
[1:07:50] <lethallylactic> umm
[1:07:52] <+Scrub_Seeker> does paige want to summon help for this boss?

[1:08:06] <Amardeux> don't swing at the non-damage ones
[1:08:06] <Exadata_> dont dodge to run away, just to avoid attacks

[1:15:09] <valriot> You beat Bloodborne
[1:15:10] <Whiteowlsmith> It depends on the player if you ask me
[1:15:13] <romanticzomedy> :3
[1:15:14] <+LuchaDePucha> it is normal. dark soul is not made to fight multiple enemies, but this boss is differnet
[1:15:14] <derap41> DS2 is the most mechanically janky one too
[1:15:16] <+JenovasPuppet> Switch back to 2 hand for PVE
[1:15:17] <romanticzomedy> ilu paige <3
[1:15:17] <Etherealizer> 2 is the hardest in the series but not in a good way

[1:16:03] <%umbypokochan> this is getting kind of annoying actually
[1:16:04] <+Punchasaur> What’s happening on screen is what actual arguments between pat and Paige look like
[1:16:07] <derap41> Just put them in the box
[1:16:07] <+Darren716> Thank you Pat
[1:16:09] <+patriotrenegade> At least you can sell them for decent souls to Gavlan
[1:16:09] <%KingGoblodyte> @PeachSaliva Paige isn't holding a sublime bone dust or flask shard, is she?
[1:16:10] <ittla> paige has spent more time dealing with cheeky invaders than fighting bosses
[1:16:11] <+demon1103> All + items are cheats
[1:16:13] <%DesertPenguin> Thanks pat
[1:16:13] <%umbypokochan> just let her do the boss
[1:16:14] <%g0atmeal> +2 isn't necessarily NG+
[1:16:17] <+Grayhammatter> it's getting kind of annoying
[1:16:19] <Niney_Who> He's using the greatsword
[1:16:21] <+xstarky151x> lol imagine ruining someone's game experience via stream sniping
[1:16:22] <chronoxgp> it's fine, she doesn't have full health anyway
[1:16:25] <Zombrocom> Nah he has a great hammer
[1:16:26] <derap41> Its an ultra great sword
[1:16:27] <+patriotrenegade> Ring of Giants +2 is for sure NG+
[1:16:28] <+Mitchellsocks> God I keep dying to Demon Prince with 1 hit left
[1:16:28] <Finakala> Claymore is faster than that I think
[1:16:28] <+OwlLightningMage> THE THOUGHT IS NOT KIND LUL
[1:16:32] <SulfurousAcid> the thought that you suck so much you need NG+ items?
[1:16:32] <FirearmsInstructor> Isn't it the same sword?
[1:16:33] <%DesertPenguin> It was annoying enough in the DS1 LP when someone gifted Woolie 50 humanity. That defeated a big part of the gameplay dynamic
[1:16:36] <%AncelDeLambert> look at this wiff-fest
[1:16:36] <%SolverCODO> "aaagh me" is the opposite of Pat's "mmmm, meeeeeee"
[1:16:37] <Jaxnos> OH.
[1:16:38] <%guildmasterahnonay> Yeah, the Name Engraved Ring is fine because that's like 10k from the cat and just promotes interaction, but Blades +2 is a late, late game ring
[1:16:38] <+xstarky151x> like how is doing that fun
[1:16:38] <romanticzomedy> This is like the opposite of stream sniping. It's stream clowncar gifting

[1:27:47] <sendart> pat big wrong
[1:27:47] <%SolverCODO> Power stance hammers would be dank
[1:27:48] <DatAsuna> WE POWER STANCE IN THIS HOUSE
[1:27:48] <%guildmasterahnonay> POWER STANCE HAMMER DO IT
[1:27:49] <%Scevda> Mace + hammer or dual wield.
[1:27:50] <%g0atmeal> Power stance isn't for beginners lol
[1:27:53] <%guildmasterahnonay> ITS SUPER GOOD
[1:27:56] <+blaccbird914> power stance and take them to pound town
[1:27:57] <ittla> shields are actually useful in this game and might really help against the gargoyles
[1:27:57] <ElemethSigma> hammerstance
[1:27:58] <Kalcom> POWER STANCE THO
[1:27:58] <%DesertPenguin> I think hammer has slightly higher range
[1:27:59] <%imadoc91> You should try the Red Iron twinblade as long as it isn't fully upgraded, it's good one handed
[1:28:00] <+NYCrownlessKing> power stance with ya big dik hammers
[1:28:01] <sauce_boss__> Power Stance
[1:28:03] <%DesertPenguin> compared to mace
[1:28:03] <Sunstalker> Pat, dual wield hammers/maces is BUSTED GOOD
[1:28:04] <+Grayhammatter> BIG fast rolls
[1:28:07] <EuropanLamprey> POWERSTANCE
[1:28:15] <%Scevda> Wow
[1:28:16] <+Your_heals> LUL never parry
[1:28:16] <derap41> Pat are you giving Paige the nob trap equipment
[1:28:21] <Finakala> Powerstance mace is amazing
[1:28:26] <TheWinged7> it's time for the return of Navi Pat
[1:28:28] <$lotharrio> Paige, no one wants to teach you how to parry over the course of 50 episodes.
[1:28:28] <+jphengstler> pat doesn't know what the fuck is good
[1:28:29] <+crimsonharvest> dont forget you have to put your shield down to regenerate stamina
[1:28:30] <%guildmasterahnonay> DUAL WIELD HAMMERS
[1:28:30] <DeathByPoke7> parry got nerfed super hard after ds1
[1:28:31] <+cvp5127> BIG
[1:28:33] <%SolverCODO> @derap41 Paige is permanent noob status
[1:28:35] <Zombrocom> Or you could stay light and dodge good
[1:28:36] <%g0atmeal> I legitimately haven't used shields in years
[1:28:36] <%boomstickery> sheilds and armour are sooooo fuckign undervalued
[1:28:36] <TheWinged7> drop your shield
[1:28:37] <Fien111> Say it with me folks! DROP! YOUR! SHIELD!
[1:28:43] <trianglehat> get heavy
[1:28:44] <carrion_king_> PERFECT, know what I mean?
[1:28:44] <%DesertPenguin> 75% is your cutoff
[1:28:47] <+cvp5127> B I G
[1:28:49] <Coystick> Hey that's not the Grand Lance I started drawing For NOTHING
[1:28:52] <%Scevda> DROP YOUR SHIELD.
[1:28:58] <derap41> Look at what the armorer sells
[1:29:02] <JollyWangcore> LET HER DUAL WIELD. SHE'S A BIG GURL. she can handle it.
[1:29:06] <%Habblewater> TURTLE
[1:29:09] <%boomstickery> like the new withcher series, he jsut slices people in fulll plate...no not possible
[1:29:12] <Niney_Who> Giant's ring
[1:29:15] <Shion963> always amazing seeing Paige navigate inventories
[1:29:18] <+crimsonharvest> if you want dual hammers its real good
[1:29:20] <+jphengstler> DUDE, DUAL WIELD FOR FUN!
[1:29:21] <+demon1103> paige already has Drang equip, best for about half the game
[1:29:23] <%guildmasterahnonay> @PeachSaliva DONT USE OLD KNIGHT SET ITS DURABILITY IS GARBAGE
[1:29:29] <Finakala> Her STR is probably easily high enough
[1:29:29] <+Tokanova> like 80
[1:29:32] <Zarkith> 1.5x the req
[1:29:32] <+jphengstler> also, power stance is busted
[1:29:33] <Kalcom> ok boomer
[1:29:33] <DatAsuna> you nly need stats for power stance
[1:29:34] <carrion_king_> It's time for everyone's favorite game show. Drop! That! Shield!
[1:29:36] <DatAsuna> anything for dual wield
[1:29:37] <Sunstalker> Dual wielding hammers/maces/clubs is a disgusting amount of dmg/stun
[1:29:38] <$SleepyMaribo> Dammit Pat you turned on my Google!!!!
[1:29:39] <%ozzrabbit> strength 1.5
[1:29:40] <+Prattlesworth> 1.5 the requirements of the weapon
[1:29:41] <Niney_Who> Drangleic
[1:29:41] <+PatchworkSquid> damnit pat
[1:29:42] <%g0atmeal> It would be even harder than using the GS
[1:29:43] <HyperBomb21> @PeachSaliva Dude who caresm use whatever you want. you can win with literally any weapon
[1:29:44] <$lotharrio> Drang-leic
[1:29:44] <LixFury> current armor
[1:29:44] <DatAsuna> @PeachSaliva dranglic armour sucks
[1:29:44] <+demon1103> the Drangleic armor
[1:29:45] <%SoFarFetched> Drangleic
[1:29:45] <nip_nips> dammit pat
[1:29:45] <+cdrom321> Drangleic set.
[1:29:45] <romanticzomedy> Yeah your armor is good for the rest of the game
[1:29:45] <+PaladinDupre> @PeachSaliva try the Red Iron Twinblade
[1:29:46] <sothatsprettybrutal> siri, please dual wield for me
[1:29:46] <CherrieVelvet> your armor?
[1:29:46] <%ThatOneGameTester> dragleic pat
[1:29:48] <%Habblewater> the shit you have on now
[1:29:49] <SumKnowBuddy> drangleic armor set u goober
[1:29:49] <Tucker0603> the armor
[1:29:49] <Shion963> it's plus half str/dex reqs
[1:29:51] <+skylerpilot> powerstance with some weapons is real in this game
[1:29:51] <%king_wragles> @PeachSaliva your armor is DRANGleic armor
[1:29:52] <derap41> Drangleic armor is a noop trap heavy armor
[1:29:52] <EuropanLamprey> powerstance hammers is amazing
[1:29:52] <%DesertPenguin> Forlorn armor is THE BEST but you have to kill him every time he invades
[1:29:53] <Niney_Who> @PeachSaliva Giant's Ring
[1:29:55] <Etherealizer> stats x1.5
[1:30:02] <tragicjohnson84> Drangelic is such a cool name
[1:30:02] <lethallylactic> LUL
[1:30:04] <+crimsonharvest> if you can one hand a ultra greatsword you can dual wield hammers
[1:30:05] <+Grayhammatter> LUL
[1:30:06] <geoffster999> you turned on my phone and my home
[1:30:06] <wbo2> i dont think paige can either
[1:30:07] <Zarkith> If it needs 20 STR, Powerstancing requires 30 STR, for example
[1:30:07] <DatAsuna> @PeachSaliva that 1.5 is only power stance, not dual wield
[1:30:09] <+Your_heals> LUL
[1:30:10] <derap41> Ultra great weapons do suck in this game
[1:30:14] <%g0atmeal> Ladle time
[1:30:16] <+ClaudeMcGarren> @HyperBomb21 clearly you dont know paige LUL
[1:30:19] <Exadata_> just any fast weapon, great weapons suck
[1:30:22] <%boomstickery> @PeachSaliva you are our wueen because you follow no path
[1:30:22] <Fien111> Paige do you not remember getting your ASS HANDED TO YOU by a fucking LADLE?
[1:30:24] <Niney_Who> Thank god
[1:30:29] <sothatsprettybrutal> what are we doing here, abandoning guts' sword?
[1:30:29] <corepercentlives> Alexa Google Ds2 scrub setup
[1:30:29] <%SvenHolgersson> Kill Woman But Hole
[1:30:30] <Lewdyhat> Paige can only win with BIG tools~!
[1:30:30] <derap41> Cleaning house
[1:30:31] <+Tokanova> organization!
[1:30:31] <DatAsuna> @PeachSaliva dual wield is not the same as power stance
[1:30:32] <%guildmasterahnonay> Thank god
[1:30:33] <Srthunda> Thanks
[1:30:34] <2fcd_twitch> YEEEEEEEEEEEEESSSSSSSSSSS

[1:30:49] <%KingGoblodyte> FINALLY
[1:30:50] <%imadoc91> Don't dump the red Iron Twinblade!
[1:30:52] <derap41> Thank you Pat
[1:30:52] <$Solidnick18> finally
[1:30:54] <%Habblewater> Goblins BTFO'd
[1:30:55] <%Chichen> BOO PUT MORE TRASH IN YOUR INVENTORY
[1:30:55] <%DesertPenguin> We are the goblins
[1:30:56] <%waltzqueen> TY
[1:30:56] <2fcd_twitch> Look at that clean inventory!
[1:30:57] <Srthunda> Not even goblins, you are just messy
[1:30:57] <carrion_king_> Hell yeah
[1:30:58] <%SvenHolgersson> Just throw em all on the ground
[1:30:59] <%imadoc91> Twinblade is life
[1:31:00] <%g0atmeal> Ladle in off hand boosts stats
[1:31:02] <%imadoc91> Twinblade is love
[1:31:03] <$i_am_therydon> you took your sweet ass time.
[1:31:03] <romanticzomedy> ATTACHE CASE SIMULATOR, DARK SOULS EDITION
[1:31:04] <MarylandJutsu> Did paige beat the gargoyles?
[1:31:04] <$StaceMcGate> apatGoblin apatGoblin apatGoblin
[1:31:06] <%guildmasterahnonay> Deposit cheat weapons?

[1:31:07] <derap41> You should put away the op stuff too
[1:31:07] <+crimsonharvest> really should stow the fume sword
[1:31:07] <%SvenHolgersson> Pick whichever is shiniest
[1:31:08] <Djinnazz> nope
[1:31:11] <%JJCheeker> apatGoblin apatGoblin apatGoblin
[1:31:11] <%spiritofmojave> Goblins have been suppressed
[1:31:14] <$lotharrio> To be fair, since Paige repeatedly gets lost in the inventory, this makes sense.
[1:31:15] <%AncelDeLambert> Get rid of that CHEAT shit, too
[1:31:18] <+highoncannon> might as well remove the busted weapons
[1:31:22] <$Solidnick18> big cheats
[1:31:22] <%AncelDeLambert> YEYYEEYEYE FUCK that cheaty crap!
[1:31:23] <$Bane_Kaikyo> HahaShrugLeft apatGoblin
[1:31:24] <peachy996> GET RID OF THAT GRAND LANCE
[1:31:28] <CherrieVelvet> grand lance!
[1:31:29] <+Grayhammatter> some of those are busted for this early
[1:31:31] <+lilo52> rip trident
[1:31:33] <geoffster999> who cares just use them
[1:31:37] <%boomstickery> @PeachSaliva forget teh OCD crowd, they have thier superpower, hoe do shitty people keep going?
[1:31:39] <Lewdyhat> Try the weapons and see which one feels right to you
[1:31:41] <derap41> That Ranch Smelter is super rare and are limited
[1:31:41] <%DesertPenguin> Holy shit she already has Red Rust Sword+5 that's really good
[1:31:43] <Exadata_> keeping greatswords DansGame
[1:31:45] <%SoFarFetched> Yeah bastard sword might work
[1:31:45] <%AncelDeLambert> Like, we had that conversation yesterday about if you beat Dark Souls you beat Dark souls... this is totally cheating
[1:31:45] <Ranger747> <3 u halberd
[1:31:47] <$lotharrio> HahaShrugLeft HahaThisisfine HahaShrugRight
[1:31:51] <Niney_Who> Eh
[1:31:52] <+greyestfox> looks like she has the large club. that's pretty fun
[1:31:53] <%SvenHolgersson> Bastard sword is dec
[1:31:55] <$Solidnick18> eh
[1:31:55] <%SpoonlessAlakazam> still carrying cheat shit LUL
[1:31:56] <TheWinged7> try tongue but hole
[1:32:00] <DeadpanSoupcan> nah
[1:32:00] <TheChillRoom> Bastard Sword is one of my favourites
[1:32:03] <+patriotrenegade> SWORD N BOARD
[1:32:07] <Niney_Who> I love hammer too much, I'm biased
[1:32:09] <+michaelpaulm20> level up a light ass sword and dip duck dive dodge and fuck
[1:32:11] <%guildmasterahnonay> The only good option is TWO MFING HAMMERS
[1:32:13] <%superc37> claymore has a better moveset
[1:32:13] <theamazingroberto> she should never have had a ginger goblin explaining the weapon upgrades and how to rush upgrade materials either but here we are
[1:32:14] <%SvenHolgersson> More like sword and BORED
[1:32:14] <AxelCezar> i believe she will be better with a faster greatsword instead of a slow vertical swinging ultragreatsword
[1:32:14] <%Scevda> HATE THAT r2
[1:32:16] <Zero_0asis> aw yes LONG souls 2
[1:32:19] <MrMcBenis> use the chicken leg
[1:32:19] <derap41> There is a straight up better vertsion of this sword its the mastadon sword
[1:32:20] <%SolverCODO> I just really wanna see double hammer
[1:32:20] <%imadoc91> Boy I am remembering now that I'm playing again how goddamn slow everything in this game is
[1:32:21] <+jphengstler> boooooo
[1:32:23] <%g0atmeal> It's a little baby great sword
[1:32:33] <DracaenaLeaf> hit
[1:32:35] <Whiteowlsmith> dont take that literally
[1:32:36] <%boomstickery> Peach inspires us by who she is not how she plays the game
[1:32:38] <Etherealizer> buy two maces and power stance them BECOME HELICOPTER you will not regret
[1:32:38] <romanticzomedy> it's a pat sized greatsword
[1:32:44] <EuropanLamprey> DOUBLE HAMMER
[1:32:48] <Finakala> You can dual wield, just not powerstance
[1:32:53] <%thejimjamz> Sadly work week starts early tomorrow- have to catch the rest on the VOD. Good luck paige, stay determined and have a happy xmas!
[1:32:57] <+jphengstler> double hammers!
[1:32:59] <DatAsuna> @PeachSaliva DUAL WIEDLING IS NOT POWER STANCING
[1:33:00] <+crimsonharvest> i agree with this two-mace position
[1:33:01] <+cvp5127> hammer time
[1:33:03] <+patriotrenegade> TURTLE UP
[1:33:07] <Niney_Who> It is very strong
[1:33:10] <%SvenHolgersson> Alright Imma go see Knives Out go kick some ass @PeachSaliva
[1:33:11] <%g0atmeal> Or hammer and sickle
[1:33:13] <DatAsuna> You can dual wield at way lower stats
[1:33:17] <LokimenD> NotLikeThis
[1:33:20] <+linkster291> Oh boy, time for sword and board. Waiting for the moment for Pat to tell Paige to drop her shield.
[1:33:20] <DeadpanSoupcan> just use the upgraded version
[1:33:21] <Finakala> Claymore and Bastard are way better than Greatsword
[1:33:22] <nip_nips> powerstance mace is op
[1:33:23] <Prism_Wing> hammer and sickle is the way to go Kappa
[1:33:26] <theamazingroberto> oh for christ's sake just use the +5 one
[1:33:26] <2fcd_twitch> Go offline
[1:33:26] <derap41> Its also has a 50% bonus vs armor its crazy because like 90% of enemies are armored
[1:33:30] <%Gogogolem> yes
[1:33:31] <sharpington_> !uptime
[1:33:32] <Exadata_> shards are nothing
[1:33:38] <+nekodelic> hammer and sickle
[1:33:46] <%Shonen_hero> might as well test the grand lance
[1:33:48] <DeadpanSoupcan> ???
[1:33:51] <$lotharrio> Hammer carry
[1:33:52] <+cdrom321> "Drop your shield. Perfect."
[1:33:54] <2fcd_twitch> That's not true
[1:33:55] <FacetiousAF> good job hammer
[1:33:58] <DeadpanSoupcan> thats just shards
[1:33:59] <%guildmasterahnonay> The hammer takes Twinkles, guys, he's right
[1:34:01] <%SoFarFetched> It still happens
[1:34:01] <%Gogogolem> oh paige is offline now?
[1:34:02] <+michaelpaulm20> way faster tho
[1:34:02] <Niney_Who> It's Unupgraded paige
[1:34:03] <+jphengstler> why not try the grand Lance?
[1:34:07] <Whiteowlsmith> yes paige but you can upgrade it
[1:34:08] <%Shonen_hero> it isn't upgraded Paige
[1:34:09] <corepercentlives> looks like a golf club FreakinStinkin
[1:34:10] <Zero_0asis> one hitter
[1:34:11] <sharpington_> how long have they been streaming?
[1:34:11] <derap41> R2
[1:34:11] <%NaturalGear> it's just a half upgraded weapon
[1:34:13] <TheWinged7> see what I mean
[1:34:14] <+Tokanova> that was 1 hit
[1:34:14] <%g0atmeal> Upgrade the hammer with large shards
[1:34:14] <Zombrocom> It's. Not Upgraded,
[1:34:15] <%zamatermort> IT IS NOT UPGRADED YET PAIGE GOD DAMN
[1:34:16] <+JenovasPuppet> Everyone will ALWAYS say it was your weapon that won the fight! Even if you use a stick.
[1:34:17] <Niney_Who> Also BLOCK
[1:34:17] <DatAsuna> @PeachSaliva the real damage comes from scaling
[1:34:17] <%CommanderSqueaks> Paige it is NOT UPGRADED
[1:34:20] <TheWinged7> know what I mean
[1:34:20] <%ThatOneGameTester> he attac
[1:34:21] <SulfurousAcid> SHIELD
[1:34:22] <peachy996> Weak Speed over Strong Blind, Paige
[1:34:23] <derap41> R2 for that range
[1:34:25] <Coystick> HE Sttrike
[1:34:26] <Shion963> shield
[1:34:26] <SulfurousAcid> USE SHIELD
[1:34:31] <+cvp5127> raise you shield
[1:34:33] <MaximumOctober> SHIELD PAIGE
[1:34:34] <Kalcom> why not just TRY the +5
[1:34:36] <+michaelpaulm20> level up
[1:34:36] <+lilo52> Upgrades increase damage
[1:34:37] <%CommanderSqueaks> Shiiiiield
[1:34:37] <+xstarky151x> upgrade. . . .. ..
[1:34:40] <Niney_Who> Paige it isn't upgraded..
[1:34:40] <romanticzomedy> remember you can use the shield when they attack now!
[1:34:40] <%Nox_ludicro> RAISE YOUR SHIELD LUL
[1:34:41] <Exadata_> not upgraded and you are comparing a slow high damge with fast low damage
[1:34:41] <Sunstalker> Upgrade some regular hammers?
[1:34:43] <$lotharrio> Also this shouldn't use sttandard upgrade items, right?
[1:34:43] <%zamatermort> UPGRADE IT
[1:34:43] <TheWinged7> upgrade before you right t
[1:34:43] <%umbypokochan> you can always go back after you beat the gargies
[1:34:43] <%king_wragles> @PeachSaliva put the skele man mask back on and be Sauron!
[1:34:43] <%g0atmeal> Oh requires Twinkly
[1:34:44] <Shion963> upgrade
[1:34:44] <+Grayhammatter> NO
[1:34:45] <%SolverCODO> Go upgrade it first tho...
[1:34:46] <Fien111> Paige is never gonna remember to even use her shield so I'd say go to a different 2-hander like a halberd or something
[1:34:47] <TwinBat> raise your shield eiloow
[1:34:47] <LaughingCatt> Should probably upgrade the weapon
[1:34:49] <%spiritofmojave> Wait till you see the true ham upgraded with some twinklite (brought to you by hammer gang)
[1:34:50] <SumKnowBuddy> why dont you upgrade this one yourself then?
[1:34:51] <karl_rex> Upgrade it
[1:34:51] <Niney_Who> It's not upgraded tho
[1:34:52] <+jphengstler> blocking is good when you have a shield
[1:34:52] <SulfurousAcid> not upgrading?
[1:34:55] <$Solidnick18> raise your shield perfect
[1:34:55] <+chronostrigger> In game music sounds weird, like a low constant static in the background
[1:34:56] <Lewdyhat> Less range, less damage, but now you can block
[1:35:00] <%boomstickery> i forgot how unusuallly big thisgame is
[1:35:01] <corepercentlives> Kappa
[1:35:03] <+Pookiedaexzile> Drop your sheild
[1:35:03] <TheWinged7> @peachsaliva upgrade the hammer
[1:35:04] <MaximumOctober> no you won't
[1:35:04] <+demon1103> this baby is so weak compared to the 25 year old boxer XD
[1:35:07] <hntronium> don't drop your shield
[1:35:08] <romanticzomedy> whenever they are attacking
[1:35:11] <+Mekhet09> You should upgrade the hammer
[1:35:12] <+jphengstler> wait, upgrade the weapon
[1:35:12] <%ozzrabbit> UPGRADE THE HAMMER!
[1:35:13] <+Grayhammatter> needs upgrades
[1:35:16] <+lilo52> !UPGRADE AT RISK!
[1:35:17] <brackboi> Hey pat can we expect more mon hun after releases?
[1:35:19] <MrNoobMcSalt> RING
[1:35:20] <%zamatermort> UPGRADE
[1:35:21] <romanticzomedy> we believe in u
[1:35:22] <+xstarky151x> why did you upgrade
[1:35:22] <%g0atmeal> Only when you're getting hit
[1:35:23] <SulfurousAcid> UPGRADE HAMMER
[1:35:23] <Finakala> How many Twinklies does she even have?
[1:35:24] <%NaturalGear> upgrade the hammer to +5 Kappa
[1:35:25] <+xstarky151x> *didn't
[1:35:25] <+jphengstler> UPGRADE HAMMER
[1:35:25] <+Mekhet09> Upgrade it first.
[1:35:26] <@Calek> it's a 100 physical block shield, you could just block all the time
[1:35:27] <Prism_Wing> keep it up
[1:35:27] <corepercentlives> every time pat is not staying to drop it
[1:35:28] <Fien111> You're very new and inexperienced.....3 games in
[1:35:31] <%weissguard> @PeachSaliva How many rings does your character have equipped right now? IIRC, you only have 3/4 atm.
[1:35:31] <TheWinged7> @peachsaliva UPGRADE THE DAMN HAMMERS
[1:35:32] <SulfurousAcid> THEY ARE SO CHEAP
[1:35:33] <+Mekhet09> You can upgrade it a few times.

[1:36:41] <nerdypanda> yabai
[1:36:42] <%SolverCODO> this is gonna be instant death
[1:36:45] <+GeneralHysterics> oh man, gargoyles gave me a hell of a time when I first fought them
[1:36:45] <2fcd_twitch> I think the Gargoyles are weak to blunt damage
[1:36:45] <+Pookiedaexzile> Hamma time
[1:36:46] <%ThatOneGameTester> Paige rarely remembers things done or said on stream Kappa
[1:36:46] <TheWinged7> if she wins I'll go drink
[1:36:49] <+Grayhammatter> this is only a test
[1:36:49] <Ianrazz> F
[1:36:52] <Niney_Who> oh god
[1:36:52] <%zamatermort> YES SHE HAS
[1:36:55] <Basch71> she's been mostly big weapons

[1:36:56] <+robobeau> How 'bout effigy-ijg it up for extra health?
[1:36:57] <+Tokanova> Not much
[1:37:00] <%SolverCODO> IMMINENT MORTIS
[1:37:01] <MarylandJutsu> Elmo watches the TESTTT
[1:37:02] <+Tokanova> not enough to learn it
[1:37:02] <peachy996> Against some bosses yea she did
[1:37:04] <Kalcom> how bout a ring
[1:37:06] <+cdrom321> She was brainwashed by Bloodborne to hate shields.
[1:37:10] <+jphengstler> at least try with the +5...
[1:37:12] <romanticzomedy> yeah shields make all the difference
[1:37:14] <Finakala> That damage is actually REAL strong
[1:37:15] <%Gogogolem> Do it paige
[1:37:16] <+Grayhammatter> oh yeyeyeye
[1:37:18] <Finakala> For no upgrade
[1:37:19] <%g0atmeal> shields are good who knew
[1:37:21] <%Gogogolem> Shame this gargoyles
[1:37:23] <trianglehat> no no focus
[1:37:23] <2fcd_twitch> Yeah, they're weak to it
[1:37:23] <%DesertPenguin> YEA YOU GOT THIS
[1:37:23] <%guildmasterahnonay> Drangleic Shield is really good yeah
[1:37:23] <%trustycoyote> She learned how to block for the fight with Gwyn in DS1
[1:37:25] <%DesertPenguin> DO BIG STRONG
[1:37:26] <+michaelpaulm20> ideally you want to damage the first one asap
[1:37:26] <Jarvanii> drop your shield
[1:37:29] <Jarvanii> perfect

[1:37:34] <whatever1616> F
[1:37:38] <%DesertPenguin> Hammer isn't even upgraded
[1:37:38] <KaiYuuta> AIM FOR THEIR ASSES NOT THEIR GROINS.
[1:37:38] <%Ion_Laser> F
[1:37:42] <+Tokanova> so here's the thing, if you're gonna block, don't dodge, dodging uses stamina
[1:37:42] <%Zulrez> cheerwhal1005 hey paige, hope you've been having a fun christmas season, good luck in dork souls, also let pat know im not sorry, that shit made me laugh for a good 20 mins edbLUL

[1:37:45] <+Mr_Pylon> Drop shield time, baby!
[1:37:46] <whatever1616> Greedy
[1:37:46] <%Faustgesicht> and switched targets
[1:37:48] <sothatsprettybrutal> those lance of longinuses are cool
[1:37:49] <%SolverCODO> Paige can't manage stamina, only count small numbers of swings. This is a mistake
[1:37:49] <TheWinged7> see what I mean
[1:37:50] <TwinBat> NUWOOLIE
[1:37:50] <romanticzomedy> see how useful a shield can be though!
[1:37:51] <+Kairi__> DROP YOUR SHIELD 🛡
[1:37:53] <+cvp5127> ring
[1:37:54] <Fien111> Honestly DS2 REALLY punishes shield use. You're kinda supposed to just dodge and focus on getting as much damage as fast as you can to deal multiple enemies in ENDLESSLY throws at you
[1:37:55] <peachy996> But how did it feel
[1:37:55] <MrNoobMcSalt> rings please
[1:37:55] <+lilo52> Never switch targets
[1:37:56] <+Grayhammatter> and switched targets
[1:37:57] <waterstealer> Thanks for the HahaGoose @zulrez
[1:37:58] <%Shonen_hero> gotta say though you were doing significant damage without the upgrade honestly
[1:37:58] <TheoTTree> Gotta stop walking up to just hit them in neutral; you always end up trading when you do that. Wait'n'bait Paige PogChamp
[1:37:59] <+Bluwizard21> Gold Pine Resin
[1:37:59] <Niney_Who> @PeachSaliva Also you have an Empty ring slot

[1:38:50] <%spiritofmojave> Need souls
[1:38:53] <%SolverCODO> Paige needs to use big weapons because she can't manage stamina, she just counts how many swings she can do at a time. Fast weapons won't work
[1:38:56] <+JenovasPuppet> Hit his face for a discount
[1:39:02] <%guildmasterahnonay> Twinkling is farmable, it'll be fine

[1:39:13] <Shion963> @emperor_machinus yeah that's the main source up till now

[1:39:22] <Emperor_Machinus> delicious
[1:39:26] <%DesertPenguin> ah, no worries
[1:39:27] <vessel0souls> Each enemy is weak to a certain dmg type
[1:39:29] <Finakala> Nothing is permanently missable in any game EXCEPT in Demon's unless you want NG+ loops
[1:39:33] <%umbypokochan> AYAYA

[1:40:39] <%DesertPenguin> @PeachSaliva Blacksmith hammer is stronger and upgrades with regular titanite. Given by Blacksmith Lenigrast if dialogue is exhausted and 8000 souls are spent on upgrades/reinforcements. (Majula).
[1:40:40] <Exadata_> drop the shield
[1:40:42] <+JenovasPuppet> Kill them all, Paige! Even the women and children!
[1:40:42] <+GeneralHysterics> real people need to die more. If they managed to stay sane in this nightmarish hell scape they're prolly not good people
[1:40:42] <%FoolsArcade> Paige dodges so much better with the shield
[1:40:45] <+Tokanova> if only you had firebombs equipped
[1:40:45] <+Grayhammatter> he tried it

[1:41:04] <Fien111> This dude's fucking slippery
[1:41:05] <+linSP> this is one of the saddest fights gotta say
[1:41:05] <corepercentlives> the more you feel for them the more powerful they become

[1:42:31] <+GeneralHysterics> For true hilarity we need to get woolie in here to coach paige
[1:42:33] <%SociallyAwkwardToaster> paige confirmed as better than woolie
[1:42:33] <$GarbageNirvana> Treat it like a parry
[1:42:33] <Manjove> DROP YOUR SHIELD!!!
[1:42:36] <+NWR_James> She's gonna forget that in 10 minutes
[1:42:38] <%tigerfang86> "advanced"
[1:42:38] <Heartless_01> LUL
[1:42:39] <romanticzomedy> yeah she went for big two handed stuff first
[1:42:39] <Kalcom> inb4 she's better woolie
[1:42:41] <derap41> She skipped a few classes
[1:42:41] <+Grayhammatter> LUL
[1:42:42] <%SolverCODO> Paige learning that advanced tech
[1:42:43] <%Razputin217> PERFECT
[1:42:43] <Goldenwolf98> Paige should dual wield hammers like a cool person
[1:42:44] <Sphincter_Spelunker> More like special
[1:42:44] <+oOZtkOo> Kappa
[1:42:45] <+GeneralHysterics> and have pat coach woolie on how to coach paige
[1:42:47] <nilla_24> ring!
[1:42:48] <Ultimatefool> Paige out here teaching Dark Souls 10001
[1:42:48] <+NWR_James> Paige galaxy brain
[1:42:51] <+VashyronM> She killed an Old One in a MINUTE
[1:42:51] <%SeniorBLT> oh my god we need to re explain why you drop your shield
[1:42:52] <tragicjohnson84> Peach was ruined by playing Bloodborne first
[1:42:53] <+JenovasPuppet> The fuck are channel points?
[1:42:55] <%guildmasterahnonay> Not how that works, Pat
[1:42:55] <sothatsprettybrutal> slabs for days
[1:42:55] <waterstealer> slabs dont work on twinkling weapons
[1:42:55] <lethallylactic> I think making Paige try to use a weapon that breaks lock-on like the greatsword was a real mistake, so this is a good change.
[1:43:02] <Goldenwolf98> YEYEYEYE
[1:43:03] <+greyestfox> I hate using shields. only against archers
[1:43:03] <%BallerSwagBro9k> Paige u should really take at least NPC allies for bosses or u gonna have a bad time
[1:43:06] <RDMOOSE> NO SHIELD
[1:43:06] <derap41> sipsipHellmo
[1:43:07] <%ozzrabbit> And then you can Powerstance BOTH hammers!
[1:43:07] <%tigerfang86> POWER
[1:43:08] <CrypticMochi> Much advanced, much smash
[1:43:09] <%tigerfang86> P O W E R
[1:43:09] <Fien111> Paige is like someone that BRUTE SMARTED her way to learning stick shift, and then gets given an automatic and immediately blows up the transmision
[1:43:09] <waterstealer> twinling weapons need 5 to max out
[1:43:13] <romanticzomedy> yeyeyeye
[1:43:15] <%SolverCODO> The poise damage is insane
[1:43:15] <Finakala> Are twinkly weapons upgraded with Slab in DS2?
[1:43:18] <%guildmasterahnonay> @PeachSaliva Pat is wrong, you need 5 twinkles to get from +4 to +5, not a slab
[1:43:20] <Kalcom> FACE FUCKING TO THE MAX
[1:43:28] <trianglehat> you can do it Paige
[1:43:28] <%superc37> @finakala nope.
[1:43:32] <derap41> There is an NPC summon for this fight that can distract these fuckers
[1:43:33] <Sphincter_Spelunker> twinks are upgrade with more twinkies
[1:43:40] <Goldenwolf98> Dual Stancing hammers is super fuckin fun
[1:43:40] <Man_of_Bore> Two hammers is a funny build.
[1:43:46] <%g0atmeal> She's dropping it! I'm so proud
[1:43:50] <+greyestfox> SHIELDS ENGENDER PASSIVITY...
[1:43:53] <derap41> That bonus vs armor is so busted
[1:43:53] <tragicjohnson84> Oh hey, it's this BS fight

[1:45:06] <%SoFarFetched> yeah this one is a lot better.
[1:45:06] <derap41> Super important to pace yourself in this fight because Gargoyles attack based on the total boss health
[1:45:06] <Niney_Who> @PeachSaliva You don't have to swing at whichever one is closest t you. Just avoid them and zone in on the Hurt one
[1:45:06] <TurtlesAndTentacles> Love you Paige!!! @PeachSaliva
[1:45:06] <%FoolsArcade> gotta be more aggressive
[1:45:07] <Srthunda> paige, just because something is up in your face doesnt mean you should hit it

[1:45:33] <RDMOOSE> full agro all the time

[1:45:38] <vessel0souls> Big weapons swing in the direction you want it to while locked on
[1:45:41] <+Mekhet09> @PeachSaliva You might want to get another ring up.
[1:45:42] <+jay521> why not use +2
[1:45:43] <+patriotrenegade> Blunt weapons are the shit
[1:45:44] <LuKVai> The hammer is better
[1:45:48] <%g0atmeal> It cuts your finger
[1:45:51] <%BurningLlama777> Punchreal, Bamada
[1:45:54] <@Calek> also gives you more stamina doesn't it
[1:45:56] <lloyddboy> PUNCHREAL IS A DAMN GOOD TOURNEY NAME

[2:20:00] <+Amingingchicken> Asuna can't stop me!
[2:20:02] <TheHeroAppears> turn it off pls
[2:20:05] <+cvp5127> 1.7 ppl
[2:20:06] <%Gogogolem> You're a streamer.
[2:20:07] <derap41> Cause you gave out your soul memory
[2:20:08] <+Your_heals> call the blue cops WubTF
[2:20:09] <+fingalights> yeah but
[2:20:09] <%Kenzo2000> Woop woop, it’s the sound of the police
[2:20:11] <Fien111> I'd say that was a dick move, but you nearly walked off that edge on your own
[2:20:11] <%Alpha8087> Youre getting more popular!
[2:20:11] <Sphincter_Spelunker> @PeachSaliva you showed your soul memory like a dummy
[2:20:11] <%valriot> DS2 was a problem
[2:20:13] <%ozzrabbit> ok. people need to stop screwing her over
[2:20:14] <Dakuu75> awwwww, hollow-invades bull shit
[2:20:18] <TheAngryArtist> can the invaders fuck off please?
[2:20:20] <DatAsuna> my gimmick is being da cops
[2:20:22] <+JenovasPuppet> It's been bad the whole time
[2:20:22] <%SpoonlessAlakazam> Jebaited
[2:20:25] <%Gogogolem> @PeachSaliva Dark souls 2 net code is way better.
[2:20:26] <%SpoonlessAlakazam> that guy
[2:20:26] <+PanicSwytch> U might have to play offline later
[2:20:29] <+patriotrenegade> Dark Souls II has a big PvP scene, more than DSI
[2:20:29] <+OwlLightningMage> Yes it has
[2:20:32] <Sunstalker> It's also the vacation month
[2:20:34] <nerdypanda> zone is nice hotspot
[2:20:35] <romanticzomedy> Yeah DaS2's PvP has like, never died down ever
[2:20:36] <%BallerSwagBro9k> BELL COVENANT
[2:20:36] <Coystick> they want that juicy Peach Meat
[2:20:37] <Chimeraelite> people have prior knowledge that you're streaming and they have time to get there
[2:20:38] <%Teintstein> hahaha, there's a line apparently
[2:20:38] <TheWinged7> it's also the holidays so more people have time
[2:20:39] <%Alpha8087> I mean I would see it as training too i na way
[2:20:40] <Madbearv> because you're a big streamer paige
[2:20:41] <%guildmasterahnonay> Also everyone's home for Christmas
[2:20:42] <$lotharrio> Because people keep wanting to upstage big blind mustard queen.
[2:20:42] <Shion963> can you even assist when she's Bell covenant?
[2:20:43] <Kalcom> the more you advance the more pepole you will find
[2:20:45] <%Faustgesicht> @PeachSaliva also you have more viewers since Dark souls 1
[2:20:46] <DatAsuna> @PeachSaliva that and bell cov is kinda pointless when not at the bell
[2:20:47] <%zorak100229> Cheer500 Hey Paige, thanks for being awesome! My first date from the other week turned out to be super racist, I told him off but am still pretty upset about it. No joke he actually started talking about phrenology..unfortunately not all skeleton talk is good...
[2:20:47] <%Alpha8087> If you can put up with the shit they do you can blitz bosses
[2:20:48] <+JenovasPuppet> It's only catching up to you now because it's been happening for so long.
[2:20:48] <%zorak100229> zorak100229's Cheer shared rewards to 10 others in Chat! 
[2:20:50] <derap41> One way to circumvent it is by using the room select ring
[2:20:51] <TheJolliestSunbro> i want egg nog
[2:20:56] <%Keyd00d> It DEFINITELY is
[2:20:57] <%superc37> @peachsaliva you could try joining the covenant of champions, it turns off all pvp and coop in exchange for making the game slightly tougher
[2:20:58] <eco419> Me yoo
[2:20:59] <BlueLunecy> DS2 PvP has been dead for me ever since they removed the golf swing
[2:21:02] <+Pookiedaexzile> Life gemthat shit
[2:21:04] <mayorrev> @peachsaliva that guy who invaded was named Savage, it censored the vag part
[2:21:09] <Crimpson> It's part of it Paige. People want their time in the spotlight
[2:21:09] <+GeneralHysterics> soul memory is so goofy
[2:21:16] <Artugoesblank> everyone wants to invade the e-girl.
[2:21:18] <Dakuu75> oh yeah ds3 is a bitch
[2:21:22] <%guildmasterahnonay> YEAH WE KNOW
[2:21:23] <%Sir_Gawain_Lotsson> tomatoDry Dry?
[2:21:25] <romanticzomedy> das3 was hell, yeah
[2:21:28] <Cybersoul666> Give elmo the controller he can handle the lost sinner
[2:21:31] <foreverN2dust> 99% of it off LP more like Kappa
[2:21:33] <%Keyd00d> it's lit
[2:21:35] <Cybersoul666> Also hiiii
[2:21:35] <+GeneralHysterics> THE BEACONS ARE LIT
[2:21:36] <Madbearv> maybe I should invade
[2:21:39] <purple_bagel> Sin time
[2:21:40] <%nofestu2> Hella lit
[2:21:40] <+GeneralHysterics> GONDOR CALLS FOR AID
[2:21:40] <Tucker0603> wait, what about luciteal
[2:21:47] <+bubba_rako> moisture tomatoDry
[2:21:51] <TheWinged7> The lights are On!
[2:21:53] <%Keyd00d> Yeah I'm sure she'll do that
[2:21:54] <derap41> That good damage
[2:21:55] <evbites> die
[2:21:59] <%ozzrabbit> Paige, at this point it would probably be worth going offline. Invasions are funny in Moderation, but people are kinda ruining it for everyone.
[2:22:02] <Dakuu75> yeah but, you gotta get your souls and bone @PeachSaliva
[2:22:04] <+Tokanova> a really LONG sword
[2:22:05] <%SpoonlessAlakazam> hobbChoke hobbUnagi
[2:22:05] <FacetiousAF> big fuckass sword
[2:22:06] <%BurningLlama777> Gig pokes
[2:22:06] <%waltzqueen> swords are magic
[2:22:08] <laserbeaming> @Tucker0603 if you summon lucatiel for 3 bossfights she'll progress her quest
[2:22:08] <%tigerfang86> just a BIG SWORD
[2:22:08] <%Gogogolem> The magic of stabbing.
[2:22:10] <%tigerfang86> like YOURS
[2:22:12] <Shion963> the true Big Strong
[2:22:15] <%spiritofmojave> Magic of sharpness
[2:22:15] <derap41> Hit boxes are so jank in DS2
[2:22:17] <+JenovasPuppet> A true Lady Gamer wouldn't go offline!
[2:22:19] <%zamatermort> Swords are magic now
[2:22:19] <%tigerfang86> SHE'S the big strong
[2:22:19] <$lotharrio> Magic of violence.
[2:22:20] <%Alpha8087> The most powerful magic of all, big stabs
[2:22:23] <+LuchaDePucha> oh she got it this time
[2:22:23] <%SolverCODO> Paige doing some real decent damage tho
[2:22:25] <peachy996> Know what this reminds me of? Fighting that Crimson Head in Remake
[2:22:27] <karl_rex> Ah the the magic called sword just like EMIYA
[2:22:29] <+emperordread> She seems slower now, does the lights make lost sinner suck?
[2:22:29] <tragicjohnson84> Shouldn't he be the "Found Sinner"??
[2:22:29] <FacetiousAF> good job shield Kappa
[2:22:31] <+Ixiah> wow 2 streams in 1 week ? must be christmas Kappa
[2:22:32] <DatAsuna> did she light both torches or one?
[2:22:33] <LuKVai> critroleCaleb BLIND critroleCaleb
[2:22:33] <SumKnowBuddy> paige: *hit by sword* WHAT IS THIS MAGIC??
[2:22:34] <Djinnazz> not really
[2:22:34] <geosspone> sipsipHellmo
[2:22:35] <%Gogogolem> Yeah i think the invasions are getting out of hand.
[2:22:37] <+fingalights> three more hits
[2:22:40] <Madbearv> drop your shield
[2:22:40] <Monkeyweed21> Why is Paige fighting hersef?
[2:22:40] <+Punchasaur> Big sword man #2456
[2:22:41] <shabop> greatshield made this one a cakewalk for me
[2:22:41] <Finakala> Both are lit
[2:22:42] <%spiritofmojave> @lotharrio that'd be a strong slasher flick name or somethin
[2:22:43] <+TopTieramisu> like all souls, it's a joke with a shield
[2:22:43] <Dakuu75> I played bloodborn as my first souls game so. I kinda like not using shields lol
[2:22:45] <ape_hawk> drop ur sheeld
[2:22:46] <Chimeraelite> I mean....I legit don't think I've ever finished a souls game with a shield
[2:22:48] <Chimeraelite> I'm weird
[2:22:48] <Djinnazz> she's gonna forget
[2:22:48] <TheJolliestSunbro> aww memories of the classic Pat + Woolie playthru of DS2
[2:22:50] <+greyestfox> ? no shes not. you just learn the roll timing
[2:22:50] <derap41> The woman murder boner is strong in this oen
[2:22:51] <nerdypanda> magic of depth perception
[2:22:51] <CurrySauseBandit> She's not bad without a shield. Just don't overdodge.
[2:22:52] <laserbeaming> Paige should have natural advantage against The Lost Sinner, she's got experience killing women
[2:22:54] <Coystick> love that she's wielding her sword WHILE SHACKLED
[2:22:55] <+lilo52> I beat her first try with 2 axes
[2:22:57] <Srthunda> Gotta admit, paige is learning how to shield very quickly
[2:22:58] <Chimeraelite> Time to go back and do that right now I suppose lol
[2:22:58] <+Pookiedaexzile> This is where bloodborne was borne
[2:22:59] <+JenovasPuppet> Moral victory achieved!
[2:23:00] <%zamatermort> lose paige
[2:23:01] <+Mekhet09> So did they turn it offline?
[2:23:01] <%guildmasterahnonay> MURDER WOMAN
[2:23:02] <romanticzomedy> she can still get lucatiel for smelty and rotten tho right?
[2:23:02] <+PanicSwytch> Lose paige
[2:23:02] <tykai1> so much damage....
[2:23:03] <Tucker0603> stahp
[2:23:04] <%SolverCODO> jukes
[2:23:05] <Kalcom> lose
[2:23:06] <codycurry52> I didn't even know about the torches. I always did this fight in the dark.
[2:23:09] <2fcd_twitch> She's doing so good
[2:23:11] <+GeneralHysterics> S T A G G E R E D
[2:23:11] <+fingalights> Paige's lady killing boner will be too strong
[2:23:11] <derap41> Not really no
[2:23:11] <%valriot> BETTER THAN WOOLIE PogChamp
[2:23:11] <abuse_of_juice> monkaS
[2:23:12] <CyprienCole> I say that's good enough...
[2:23:13] <TheAngryArtist> rolling is way easier than shield, dont know why everyone loves board so much.
[2:23:14] <Rangenade> online invasions are fun if you know how to pvp and defend yourself , if your a single player kinda person its like getting bodied in a fighting game
[2:23:14] <%tigerfang86> it's not
[2:23:15] <Tucker0603> no!
[2:23:16] <Finakala> Lucatiel quest is the best part of this game
[2:23:16] <%Keyd00d> yeah fuck it
[2:23:17] <%SoFarFetched> but lucatiel though
[2:23:20] <%SpoonlessAlakazam> the shield just eats every single hit LUL
[2:23:20] <waterstealer> NO
[2:23:21] <karl_rex> Yeah but its really sad
[2:23:22] <shabop> now shell die
[2:23:22] <ittla> npc quests are a chore and worth basically nothing
[2:23:22] <+Tokanova> CRUSH THAT SINNER PUS
[2:23:22] <+TopTieramisu> BUT LUCATIEL
[2:23:22] <waterstealer> PAT WHY
[2:23:23] <tragicjohnson84> Paige got's the big Strength

[2:23:56] <%juxtest> Not-orias
[2:23:57] <LuKVai> CRAZY TALK? IS THAT U?
[2:23:58] <%DesertPenguin> In this game, fast attacks will always win out over strong ones. Better to go for "DO COMBO" instead of "BIG NUMBER" for now

[2:26:22] <Sphincter_Spelunker> yeah eh
[2:26:24] <+JenovasPuppet> Fire was the true summon sign
[2:26:26] <+Mitchellsocks> The level scaling in this game is so weiiiird
[2:26:26] <Zombrocom> All the bosses is DS2 are pretty easy. Smelter can be an asshole though
[2:26:28] <Kalcom> STR
[2:26:29] <SumKnowBuddy> but what about dual wielding tho
[2:26:32] <+Pookiedaexzile> Dual Weild

[2:26:43] <%ozzrabbit> put it in DEX for fun dual weapon times!
[2:26:43] <derap41> read the mask
[2:26:45] <TheAngryArtist> I replayed DS2 a couple months ago. the bosses are laughably easy.
[2:26:45] <%BurningLlama777> What were the sins of her past
[2:26:45] <CurrySauseBandit> @juxtest But she's not though.
[2:26:45] <%FoolsArcade> Her Mask has more info
[2:26:47] <+jphengstler> she might not have been that hard, but I am
[2:26:48] <Monkeyweed21> You can still do Lucatiel quest @PeachSaliva
[2:26:48] <%Keyd00d> Best lore in the game?
[2:26:49] <theRESNACKable> dual wield time?
[2:26:51] <+JenovasPuppet> Pat lied, that was not interesting.
[2:26:52] <$lotharrio> Pat's big favorite lore.

[2:26:57] <Zombrocom> Her set has the lore
[2:26:57] <+emperordread> Eat souls, make strong
[2:26:58] <derap41> The Mask
[2:27:00] <%MyNameIsRasus> it's her mask that has the lore
[2:27:00] <%arcaderabbit48> Belfry gives you one of the worst weapons in the game! Its actually super insulting!

[2:27:01] <%worldbrand> the NG+ soul?
[2:27:03] <+GeneralHysterics> the lost sinner being The Chaos Witch is crazy
[2:27:03] <Zarkith> The NG+ soul?
[2:27:03] <Man_of_Bore> @peachsaliva On the plus side you can just murder Lucatiel for her stuff anyway.

[2:27:21] <%zorak100229> Consume soul
[2:27:23] <$lotharrio> @Dakuu75 Might be that the Sinner did a similar messed up thing as the Witch.

[3:01:59] <%arcaderabbit48> @PeachSaliva Just leap off the edge when someone invades you. Dont give them the satisfaction
[3:01:59] <JDebss> Yeah you can just fuck off already
[3:01:59] <%weissguard> Invading is getting a little old.
[3:02:01] <RantingRavager> LUL Called out LUL
[3:02:01] <%juxtest> Victory!
[3:02:03] <%Royalguard22> Enough is enough for the invasions
[3:02:04] <%BurningLlama777> ~sadness~
[3:02:05] <nerdypanda> free souls
[3:02:06] <%DesertPenguin> YOU'RE RUINING HER FUN GUYS
[3:02:06] <+AtlasMcCoy> At least ballerswagbro didnt win

[3:02:07] <+Havinstroke> at least you don't have Plague on your ass
[3:02:07] <EuropanLamprey> CAN this guy give someone else a chance
[3:02:08] <+OwlLightningMage> YES
[3:02:08] <+fingalights> It's not his fault he is invading
[3:02:09] <Sphincter_Spelunker> It's explicitly his fault
[3:02:09] <derap41> Not sure shit gets old
[3:02:09] <+Jaysky> I'd rather see you play offline
[3:02:09] <+shouttothevoid> killed tha streamer tho
[3:02:11] <+hawk_rush> just play offline there is no beneift to playing online
[3:02:11] <%BallerSwagBro9k> I wasn't gonna fight her
[3:02:12] <OBS_VinnieK> yeah time to take it offline
[3:02:12] <Conky89> Try appearing offline?
[3:02:13] <$SleepyMaribo> no fuck him, its annoying now
[3:02:14] <CyprienCole> ban the person
[3:02:14] <%Zaphire_Saucypants> I just want Paige to have fun and progress
[3:02:15] <peachy996> It's best call
[3:02:15] <+hawk_rush> when streaming
[3:02:15] <+fingalights> It's just his choice, Not his fault
[3:02:15] <honeyman18> Dude man, the boss time is now
[3:02:17] <%guildmasterahnonay> Yeah, if you've got a cool gimmick and you invade a single time, that's cool, but don't give her OP shit or invade constantly
[3:02:17] <%FoolsArcade> literally just adding stress go offline
[3:02:19] <Shion963> maybe not on a boss run??
[3:02:19] <Chimeraelite> oh there you are
[3:02:20] <grimporio> dodging gameplay mechanics
[3:02:21] <Valdorick> You can not drop items to help the stream go faster, but then invade every 10 minutes
[3:02:21] <+xstarky151x> literally apologizing for someone who is being an ass
[3:02:21] <%Royalguard22> Swagbro ruined it for everyone
[3:02:22] <+cdrom321> Fuck off, Swag. We want to summoned and now they're going to switch to offline.
[3:02:22] <LuKVai> Just play OFFLINE
[3:02:23] <Dakuu75> "I don't mean to be rude" she says to the LITERAL STALKER
[3:02:23] <%Habblewater> Ballerswag GO amirite gamers
[3:02:24] <FacetiousAF> constant invasion was a shitty choice from the devs
[3:02:24] <Psyramics> sick of seeing invaders constantly
[3:02:25] <DatAsuna> time to hang up the cop cap
[3:02:27] <FairOnFire> Yall just seeking attention now
[3:02:28] <FirearmsInstructor> @PeachSaliva Can you just ask people to not? Or do they not care?
[3:02:31] <peachy996> Save the invasions for a later stream
[3:02:31] <%DesertPenguin> @ballerswagbro9k Oh just gonna give her shit that she's not gonna use anyway?
[3:02:31] <%spiritofmojave> Mean it's bound to after a while, invading is funny after a good bit of progression
[3:02:31] <derap41> cheats and stress
[3:02:33] <DatAsuna> you coulda just burned an effigy
[3:02:34] <CyprienCole> never play anything online
[3:02:34] <$FrostedZaibatsu> Yall really didnt learn from the DS1 playthrought. Yall asses ANNOYING
[3:02:34] <%BurningLlama777> Good job breaking the camel's back @BallerSwagBro9k ;) ;)

[3:02:36] <DatAsuna> you have tons
[3:02:38] <%BallerSwagBro9k> I was gonna give her 1 more ring LUL
[3:02:41] <%damienlunas> It's almost like the invasion mechanic is inherently unfun
[3:02:41] <+demon1103> @derap41 actually in Souls, Orn shows up more since no Patches in 2, but they tied in Soulsborne
[3:02:42] <%DesertPenguin> STOP

[3:02:48] <%DesertPenguin> SOrry for the caps
[3:02:49] <%segonian> I love how twitch never tells me when you're streaming. it's great.

[3:02:59] <shabop> just unplug the router
[3:02:59] <%spiritofmojave> Don't give her cheat stuff jermaPluto
[3:02:59] <Whiteowlsmith> Except when you happen to be invading the same stream ten times it goes from choice to just delaying the stream
[3:02:59] <%BallerSwagBro9k> Oh NOOOOOOOOO it was me
[3:03:01] <+LuchaDePucha> if you are not going to call for help might as well play offline
[3:03:02] <%JetpackMcQuack> oh well
[3:03:03] <+NobleJedi> it's kinda cheating
[3:03:04] <+Mr_Pylon> Down with invasions!
[3:03:04] <FacetiousAF> cheater swag bro
[3:03:09] <%DesertPenguin> Woolie's was such a joke yea
[3:03:09] <zenith0111> HAHAHAHAHA
[3:03:13] <+OwlLightningMage> WOOLIE'S LP WAS RUINED
[3:03:14] <$Piemono> Fair play is for losers
[3:03:14] <peachy996> It was never fun Pat
[3:03:14] <ShimmerFairy> The messages on the ground are the only good thing to online, and you've got Pat to give you tips instead!
[3:03:17] <%starotter70> Paige loves the cheats
[3:03:17] <LuKVai> STOP WITH THE CHEATING GUYS
[3:03:17] <%BurningLlama777> It's all in good fun everyone. It's no big. XD
[3:03:18] <%BallerSwagBro9k> No it was gonna be a on cheat ring
[3:03:18] <Aydarkzero> LUL
[3:03:18] <EuropanLamprey> I've been trying to invade since 5he beginning and swag bro has invade ed like 50 times
[3:03:19] <sothatsprettybrutal> his smile and optimism: gone
[3:03:22] <%Keyd00d> It's much more fun to get the items the way the game gives them to ya
[3:03:23] <+zaworldo> swagbro himself didn't ruin it, the constant invasions did.
[3:03:24] <+OwlLightningMage> PAT IS SUPER RIGHT
[3:03:24] <%BallerSwagBro9k> non
[3:03:25] <%Keyd00d> IMO
[3:03:27] <Conky89> It would be one thing if random people were invading. But the same person? That is justified to go offline.
[3:03:27] <peachy996> Woolie is terrible to watch play souls period
[3:03:27] <FacetiousAF> cheating cancelled
[3:03:30] <%DesertPenguin> Well what ring was it then?
[3:03:32] <+xstarky151x> his form of fun is not everybody elses form of fun
[3:03:32] <%tigerfang86> CHEAT DENIED
[3:03:35] <Fujiwara_92> big cheating
[3:03:37] <zenith0111> LUL
[3:03:37] <%BurningLlama777> @BallerSwagBro9k I was just funning, everyone knows you're cool
[3:03:37] <JanusII> This isn't your chat, Pat. LUL
[3:03:38] <Sphincter_Spelunker> Remember when Woolie ran all the way to the end of Armored Spider's tunnel, then turned around?
[3:03:38] <DatAsuna> @BallerSwagBro9k what soul mem we at?
[3:03:39] <peachy996> sorry woolie I can't stand how you play
[3:03:41] <honeyman18> Whatever, as long as the stream is fun
[3:03:43] <%guildmasterahnonay> Was it at least a fun ring?
[3:03:44] <LuKVai> EVEN PATT DON'T WANT THAT MUCH CHEAT
[3:03:44] <Fien111> Ok, I didn't see the full Woolie play of DeS but I was kinda wondering how the FUCK he beat it in like 6 streams. That explains it
[3:03:44] <XzileGaming> i cant watch woolie play anything, tho i like woolie
[3:03:46] <+LightReverb> I just got a sekiro ad weird

[3:03:54] <%Ion_Laser> sipsipElmo
[3:03:57] <%DesertPenguin> What ring was it?
[3:03:58] <+Promessa_EX> They changed it
[3:03:59] <+cdrom321> @damienlunas Agreed. I absolutely HATE invasions. They ruin the game. The multiplayer should be entirely voluntary for both parties.
[3:04:01] <%spiritofmojave> Bulli jurisdiction
[3:04:02] <SulfurousAcid> change rings
[3:04:03] <rubbishbinge> woolie needed to lern what the spider did ;w;
[3:04:03] <%BurningLlama777> I know! But I wanted *you* to know. :3
[3:04:04] <FacetiousAF> is pat even a mod here

[3:04:24] <%guildmasterahnonay> Oh yeah you should take off the Bell ring when you're offline
[3:04:24] <CyprienCole> Pat right he cheats all the time so you don't have too
[3:04:24] <JDebss> That's Pat's gimmick!
[3:04:25] <EuropanLamprey> Ming Goblin has been denied :(

[3:04:27] <+chronostrigger> Pat is the cheating boy!
[3:04:28] <mayorrev> PAT THAT DOESN'T SOUND GOOD OUT OF CONTEXT

[3:04:45] <+hawk_rush> I don't think I've ever played online for souls games, it's just not a fun thing
[3:04:47] <%Jack_of_No_Trades> don't massage her shoulders that's coaching!
[3:04:47] <FacetiousAF> i have doggo. she is good.
[3:04:49] <karl_rex> Booster seat modding
[3:04:49] <$Huderga> run give up
[3:04:50] <%Shonen_hero> Paige you should try running past them just to see if she can
[3:04:50] <derap41> But Pat you don't know how to drive
[3:04:50] <%CommanderSqueaks> @dekkitout It's not like he's rubber her shoulders or anything.
[3:04:52] <%BallerSwagBro9k> @desertpenguin 1st and 2nd dragon ring
[3:04:52] <DatAsuna> pat's done many cean rips ofthat too

[3:04:56] <ittla> just run to fog door
[3:04:58] <Dakuu75> @SweepTheLegoMyEggo I don't think it'd be the first time either, lol
[3:05:05] <SkyPirateArcane> Paaaige you know you can't have booster seats in the front seat! It's dangerous for the child
[3:05:12] <%DesertPenguin> @ballerswagbro9k YEA THAT'S STILL CHEATING BRO
[3:05:19] <%DesertPenguin> whoops still on
[3:05:21] <LuKVai> THE TRUE CHEAT IS PAT SAYING HE IS PROVIDING "PRO" TIPS HahaBall
[3:05:22] <+tuchpi> @SkyPirateArcane LUL
[3:05:22] <TheChillRoom> I'm honestly excited to be getting a character up to dueling soul level again.
[3:05:23] <+JenovasPuppet> Are there any Sprint Shoes in this game? Because that's what an invader needs to give her so she can run to the damn boss!
[3:05:24] <%DesertPenguin> Yea, please don't do that buddy
[3:05:24] <%BallerSwagBro9k> @peachsaliva Welp it was fun while it lasted. Have fun guys I'm sleepy
[3:05:27] <%epoladia> She probly could run passed, but she needs to show she's bigstrong
[3:05:28] <DatAsuna> thosse would be cheat rings ues
[3:05:31] <Whiteowlsmith> nn swagbro
[3:05:31] <theRESNACKable> maybe run to boss door next time
[3:05:33] <Fien111> I ALWAYS played offline in souls, the invasions are just garbage when you're trying to get a level done. The netcode is trash and people forget the tryhard cheese builds that dominated the online
[3:05:34] <%Habblewater> Nice job Paige
[3:05:34] <+Grayhammatter> crunch them bones
[3:05:34] <Kain5707> C R O N C H
[3:05:37] <+cdrom321> @ittla Maybe at least one of these enemies will disappear for good.
[3:05:38] <+AtlasMcCoy> Is paige doing better or worse with the shield strats?
[3:05:39] <Aydarkzero> uh oh
[3:05:41] <%DesertPenguin> So now that you can't invade her anymore you're gonna leave. Wow dude....
[3:05:42] <$ReaderWatcherPlayer> Since his spear is on the left, try strafing to the right
[3:05:43] <zenith0111> Big Cheater ^
[3:05:45] <TheyCallMeVawn> You can roll too
[3:05:45] <+GeneralHysterics> paige is a stone cold killer
[3:05:46] <derap41> These white guys sure are fast
[3:05:49] <Quietshun13> you can run past everyone
[3:05:53] <TheHeroAppears> @AtlasMcCoy yes
[3:05:54] <Zarkith> Better @AtlasMcCoy
[3:05:55] <%spiritofmojave> H-he's fast
[3:05:56] <Fien111> Getting lagstabbed gets old real fucking quick
[3:06:01] <Shion963> no they're not THAT fast
[3:06:02] <Sphincter_Spelunker> too fast, for the naked eye
[3:06:02] <%DesertPenguin> You got this Paige
[3:06:04] <Ragin_Asian06> damn when Paige gets focused she slaps
[3:06:04] <derap41> Also effegys are way safer now
[3:06:05] <+emperordread> END is best stat because you can run away for longer
[3:06:05] <+tuchpi> @BallerSwagBro9k ResidentSleeper
[3:06:07] <$The_Lady_Alustriel> I love pvp and invasions so I'm always online. In 3 I would run with Dried Finger as well. It's a fun element
[3:06:10] <VVerewolfJones> Estus Flask would be a great name for a drunken wizard
[3:06:20] <sothatsprettybrutal> the white armor gives him triple the speed of a normal knight
[3:06:22] <VVerewolfJones> Like in D&D
[3:06:24] <%BurningLlama777> If I was an armorman I'd want armor like that.
[3:06:24] <%spiritofmojave> Sooo remember now, yet?
[3:06:25] <XzileGaming> if this game was called Unborn Souls, Paige would have beaten it already
[3:06:27] <2fcd_twitch> My computer had a stroke. What happened while I was gone?
[3:06:28] <%guildmasterahnonay> The PVP is the most fun part of Dark Souls and I don't mind invasions, but the constant stream sniping isn't anywhere close to cool
[3:06:29] <JDebss> So does Paige remember him yet?
[3:06:30] <karl_rex> DODGE
[3:06:33] <%BurningLlama777> Not exactly, but *like* that.
[3:06:35] <TheChillRoom> Man, I forgot just how good blunt damage was in DS2
[3:06:35] <%Urdunngurdunn> Have you tried going lefyt?
[3:06:36] <+Hippineapple228> for the first playthrough of dark souls 1 would anyone recommend going to ash lake before ringing the second bell?
[3:06:38] <%DesertPenguin> I just got two cats and one is grey/white with a blue eye. What should I name him?
[3:06:39] <zenith0111> sfoxUYY sfoxUYY sfoxUYY sfoxUYY sfoxUYY sfoxUYY sfoxUYY sfoxUYY
[3:06:45] <+LuchaDePucha> wow thats a lot of damage
[3:06:45] <Shion963> don't block 2H pokes
[3:06:47] <%BurningLlama777> I'd have like dragon horns instead of a plume.
[3:06:50] <%MyNameIsRasus> COME ON AND SLAM
[3:06:57] <%guildmasterahnonay> @Hippineapple228 if you want to get absolutely slaughtered, sure
[3:06:59] <%starotter70> @DesertPenguin Blue eyes grey cat
[3:06:59] <Sphincter_Spelunker> @Hippineapple228 why not, not much to there anyhow
[3:07:01] <jimmypurple> @vverewolfjones The glowing flask sounds like a tavern with a potions master on the second floor
[3:07:02] <%CommanderSqueaks> @2fcd_twitch She got invaded by the same person one too many times and is playing offline, that'a bought it.
[3:07:03] <%starotter70> I'm sorry
[3:07:04] <esoteric_order_of_swagon> WELCOME TO THE JAM

[3:07:06] <%spiritofmojave> @DesertPenguin S a n s (sorry it was obvious LUL )
[3:07:06] <$The_Lady_Alustriel> There's a fine line between invading the streamer for funsies and gatekeeping
[3:07:08] <zenith0111> Pro Dodge sfoxUYY
[3:07:14] <%epoladia> that was a nallsy sidestep
[3:07:15] <+fingalights> Ded

[3:07:26] <+GeneralHysterics> PIKA PIIIII

[3:15:47] <%DesertPenguin> not every level
[3:15:49] <%MyNameIsRasus> if moobot is gone we can post our pornhub links!
[3:15:51] <%DesertPenguin> It goes up to 78
[3:15:53] <Ianrazz> Its fucking 2:00 am where i am, fuck me
[3:15:54] <%DesertPenguin> or 75
[3:15:54] <+OwlLightningMage> IT DOES PAT
[3:15:56] <Monkeyweed21> thats wrong pat
[3:15:58] <%g0atmeal> Better elemental defense
[3:15:58] <%epoladia> will it eventually go up?
[3:15:59] <Aydarkzero> stability doesn't go up for most big shields
[3:16:02] <%DesertPenguin> yes it goes up
[3:16:02] <derap41> only on some levels its still a waste of shards
[3:16:04] <%guildmasterahnonay> It doesn't go up with every upgrade, but it does go up
[3:16:04] <%DesertPenguin> YES IT DOES
[3:16:04] <TsunTsuchinoko> it goes up every other lvl or something
[3:16:04] <RetributionP> it upgrades
[3:16:04] <+OwlLightningMage> NOT EVERY SINGLE LEVEL

[3:16:19] <%spiritofmojave> Every other there you go
[3:16:20] <fruit_pie_the_magician> Upgrading it WILL make her take less elemental damage through it
[3:16:28] <+demon1103> it also ups resistances
[3:16:29] <+Grayhammatter> yes, yes you are

[3:42:17] <Fujiwara_92> ONE HAND PAIGE
[3:42:17] <SulfurousAcid> WHY 2 HAND?
[3:42:18] <lethallylactic> 1-Hand for the wide swweps

[3:45:01] <Niney_Who> Pat HATES ever telling Paige to 1hand the Greatsword
[3:45:03] <CherrieVelvet> one hand horizontal tho
[3:45:03] <%FoolsArcade> Da Giant Rat Dat Makes all Da Rulz is in a different zone guys
[3:45:04] <+LuchaDePucha> please ask her to one hand pat
[3:45:04] <InugamiTheHound> @emperordread I thought so, don't worry I'm a furry as well.
[3:45:05] <zenith0111> TEEHEE
[3:45:05] <nerdypanda> cant see the rat cuz ur a coward
[3:45:06] <+fingalights> Find the one who makes all da rules
[3:45:07] <TheHeroAppears> this fight might be the hardest for paige, since it very much requires vision
[3:45:08] <lethallylactic> 1-Hand the Greatsword please NotLikeThis
[3:45:09] <WhitePantherZ> 2 handing the sword is Garbo for this
[3:45:10] <Brother_Coduss> @PeachSaliva the greatsword catches on the statues
[3:45:12] <2fcd_twitch> Y button
[3:45:12] <FirearmsInstructor> @PeachSaliva because the apatBig sword doesn't mean apatBig wins, and you're like 3x + better with sword & hammer
[3:45:14] <+patriotrenegade> rats > gargoyles
[3:45:16] <Finakala> 2 hand the hammer, shield won't help here and you might be able to oneshot with 2h
[3:45:18] <%zamatermort> 1 hand greatsword is actually real good here
[3:45:20] <%Promessa_EX> Hey use an effigy pat is crazy
[3:45:22] <+JenovasPuppet> I love it, but it is beyond my understanding how Paige can make 1 syllable words into 2.

[3:46:27] <+fingalights> I never finished DS2, I got bored and just couldn't be bothered
[3:46:30] <FirearmsInstructor> @PeachSaliva Also she's not using the right ring, etc. Switch that up after she wins, too.

[3:46:47] <nerdypanda> and bask
[3:46:50] <Silly_Duckling> I mean, using the hammer correctly vs using the greatsword wrong will make the hammer look great.
