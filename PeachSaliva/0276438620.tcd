[0:16:16] <GarbageQueenEllie> But then you couldn't wear bikinis without it flopping out
[0:16:16] <$NaotoKozuki> Thats a thing people do

[0:16:26] <TheAzureGamer> @PeachSaliva You should check out the David Cage AMA where he explains how the "free will touch" works by saying it gives androids "an emotional shock"
[0:16:26] <@WoolyFish> How would you even bend it while erect though?
[0:16:26] <Mr_Strut> The dick would have to be mounted below the vagina
[0:16:26] <Logan_Jennings1> This question is uhh a bit not very Christian stream

[0:45:50] <%Freelance7> OR WAS IT?
[0:45:50] <+Daigrey> !BIG FLAPPED!

[0:45:56] <puddingpants88> cops going to have words
[0:45:56] <$RutilusMonachus> "Good"
[0:45:57] <+AncelDeLambert> HOW DO THEY PICK YOU UP SO FAST?!
[0:45:58] <ShadeTheNovice> It is litterally the worst scene in the game
[0:45:58] <NemokillerV> GAME OVER
[0:45:58] <$RubberFistFight> "that was a good scene" oh boy are you gonna get schooled Paige
[0:45:59] <Too_Much_Nukie> @PeachSaliva Fun fact: The time limit in this scene is entirely fake. Which is fine because that sequence has no real consequences anyway.
[0:45:59] <$GohanEgret> FLAPPO'D
[0:45:59] <%Lion_kun> SHE WAS SO CLSOE THOUGH
[0:46:00] <Shastafield> no it wasnt Kappa
[0:46:00] <@Calek> "That was a good scene" oh sweetie
[0:46:01] <dalishprince> pagie goes to jail 😡
[0:46:02] <$ozzrabbit> She missed he magnifying glass too.
[0:46:02] <Hawkbone_> Guess what: it doesn't matter. Its literally just this one scene and then it continues as if you got everything.
[0:46:04] <seniorwhiteface> Pac Man Dies sound
[0:46:04] <%SuperCasualBoom> Try Paige’s Package of Wipes...so great, you’ll forget you forgot!!
[0:46:05] <Firesparks> time for our favorite cop
[0:46:07] <+AncelDeLambert> This scene is so pointless
[0:46:08] <%Faustgesicht> Has anyone ever not gotten this scene?
[0:46:09] <+Th3SmartAlec> I don't get why nobody just does Exterior Collisions
[0:46:10] <AirlineFood74> @ozzrabbit no she got it
[0:46:11] <ancrest_tant> It's hard, but also doesn't matter
[0:46:11] <DigbyMayor> You THINK it was a good scene...
[0:46:13] <FenixSeraph> what the hell is going on with the music
[0:46:14] <DraxTD> @Lion_kun yeah it was like 1 item right?
[0:46:15] <+ruddyredbone> such a bad part
[0:46:17] <sackerkappa> Human Connor will deal with you now.
[0:46:18] <+AncelDeLambert> Why even bother if you're gonna fail it every time?
[0:46:20] <%Lion_kun> JUST THE PHONE
[0:46:20] <circular7> none
[0:46:21] <$mandragoraroot> what is this lip syncing?
[0:46:21] <LiquidMathew> the fingerprints would only prove they were there at some point
[0:46:27] <+AncelDeLambert> No consequence, no purpose!!
[0:46:28] <SubliminaIMessages> that's a very obsessively demanding scene
[0:46:30] <Papako> You can SEE this scene is badly animated.
[0:46:30] <GarbageQueenEllie> No repercussions
[0:46:36] <+ruddyredbone> ew lip sync
[0:46:37] <AMajorTom> I sure hope this Shelby fellow won't be blamed for murder
[0:46:38] <mr_gentleman96> test
[0:46:38] <puddingpants88> "so why did you try to clean the prints?"
[0:46:40] <FenixSeraph> @sackerkappa BTW David Cage confirmed Connor was based off of Nahman Jayden
[0:46:41] <+TheHairiestHare> He sounds like shit too
[0:46:44] <AFlyingTaco1> Literally pointless
[0:46:45] <Too_Much_Nukie> Game overs are a failure of the game designer.
[0:46:45] <%GeneSlamm> Also obvious frenchman trying to do an american accent
[0:46:46] <%LifesNeverHumDrum> he sounds exactly like Gordie Kramer
[0:46:46] <%Lion_kun> you know fingerprints are useless unless the police have you on file
[0:46:46] <derap41> oh obstruction of justice is a punishable offence no matter the reasons
[0:46:51] <+Th3SmartAlec> @AncelDeLambert When scenes exist just to put in plot holes. That's dedication!
[0:46:51] <DapperHatwell> No consequences are a failure of the game designer.

[0:47:11] <$koriar> cheer100 Hey new favorite streamer, wanted to counter Crazy Talk a bit about LISA from a few streams ago. LISA is plenty dark but isn't as horrifying as Pat made it sound. For the most part I've heard darker on the friendcast. Also Pat burns down a town and there is a McDonalds Cult. Still, I can understand wanting to avoid dark games for a bit. cheer100
[0:47:12] <AFlyingTaco1> Just shoot him!
[0:47:13] <+sana_kan> it's fine!
[0:47:13] <%MightyMaxT> SHUT UP THO

[0:47:18] <sackerkappa> But Connor is cool despite not having much of a personality. He just wants to do his job.
[0:47:19] <+mcjimbo12> probably faster if your prints are already in the system

It is not something that I consciously thought of during the writing, but it is one of the possible ways to read Connor's story."
[1:14:34] <+Blargimazombie> Trying to do some sick gay men?
[1:14:37] <Mr_Strut> Paige, you can't even function without backseating!

[3:24:18] <DraxTD> @Tarkara she figured that out last time, so no spoilers
[3:24:18] <bakedcheeseman> Stuck in the matrix
[3:24:19] <+AncelDeLambert> Standard issue!!
[3:24:21] <+that_guy_from_high_school> are they made of LSD?
[3:24:22] <+PipIV> dead
[3:24:25] <+AncelDeLambert> Every FBI agent!!
[3:24:27] <+TheGershon> You know what is hard
[3:24:32] <%Freelance7> I think she got enough clues
[3:24:32] <@Moobot> We're accepting fanfiction submissions, if you think you have a good one message a mod today!
[3:24:33] <+KittenHachiChan18> SO, anyone seen any good movies lately?
[3:24:36] <+PipIV> So dead
[3:24:45] <%AlopekisPup> No one actually figures it out
[3:24:49] <Tarkara> @DraxTD fair enough then
[3:24:50] <+pleasenameyourcharacter> @that_guy_from_high_school maybe it's Cage saying too much video games is bad for your brain
[3:24:54] <%GoCoSpace> !uptime
[3:24:54] <@Moobot> 3h 25m 3s since bed time stories began.
[3:24:56] <Hawkbone_> Apparently the tripto cures the glasses fucking you up, but its never explained why taking the tripto is bad.
[3:24:58] <Sapphire_Breeze> too slow
[3:25:00] <%AlopekisPup> Because it was the old lady the entire time
[3:25:02] <$RubberFistFight> @KittenHachiChan18 UPGRADE was the last one i watched and it was awesommmmeeee
[3:25:02] <+FrostMass22> Apparently Incredible 2 is bad
[3:25:11] <mercado94> Incredibles 2 was ok
[3:25:11] <$Piemono> The glasses wouldn't allow you to hear sound
[3:25:12] <$OdysseyKnight> He gonna die
[3:25:15] <$waltzqueen> I HEARD IT WAS GOOD
[3:25:15] <$gamewarden92> Taking tripto doesn't effect the ending at all.
[3:25:16] <+TheGershon> Nahh it was good
[3:25:17] <OkamiDude15> incredibles 2 was fine
[3:25:17] <DantesAnimus> So...did he just not bring up Paco's death to anyone or what???
[3:25:17] <fazoburquina> this thing is really stupid if you think about it
[3:25:20] <$waltzqueen> opps caps lock
[3:25:20] <+KittenHachiChan18> @RubberFistFight Awesome! I heard it was great! Saw the trailer when I went to see A Quiet Place

[3:25:23] <+KittenHachiChan18> Looked pretty good
[3:25:24] <ItsMeUncleEric> @FrostMass22 you heard wrong
[3:25:27] <+Nefarious_Bear> ANALYZE CUBE
[3:25:28] <+Dingus_Tickler> Incredibles 2 is good, not as good as 1
[3:25:29] <+that_guy_from_high_school> @pleasenameyourcharacter Is this why Cage makes bad games? So we won't play them?
[3:25:29] <elementofloyalty> honk
[3:25:32] <%Freelance7> Why would ARI kill him? Why does he need drugs for glasses?
[3:25:36] <Doctadaking> The clues and connections he makes are so contrived and dumb
[3:25:36] <+TheGershon> I liked it about as much as 1
[3:25:37] <Sapphire_Breeze> faster
[3:25:37] <bakedcheeseman> My ending was not paying child support anymore...
[3:25:42] <generalve> check his wrist
[3:25:46] <somnibrew> pixar hasn't been good for years

[3:25:51] <+krawtch> THATS why people say ARI-GAMY killer
[3:25:51] <%ThePushaMan> this whhole game is stupid if you think about it

[3:26:06] <+KittenHachiChan18> The discarded plotlines are stupid too
[3:26:08] <+pleasenameyourcharacter> @that_guy_from_high_school funny thing about that, I just don't play HIS games, so that backfires.
[3:26:09] <+KittenHachiChan18> -_-

[3:26:11] <+AncelDeLambert> look at that fake ass fighting
[3:26:13] <+AXL808> kind of dumb he uses a sophisticated virtual technology to create a conventional filing cabnet
[3:26:13] <$RubberFistFight> @KittenHachiChan18 you should see it. Although the first 15 or so minutes are reeaaaallly rough and depressing. The actor and the writer/director really captured the helplessness and depression that quadriplegics feel post-injury.

[3:32:27] <+Fenrirlives> There were two giant planks of FUCKIN WOOD
[3:32:27] <ThePowerOfRa420> FUCK THIS SCENE

[3:32:45] <LiquidMathew> He also says Shaun Mars is missing before it is reported
[3:32:45] <the_phantom_theif> It's always the detective.
[3:32:46] <+RafflesiaA> Why was that match sparkling before the fire started
[3:32:46] <Doctadaking> Those stupid thoughts ruin this twist entirely
[3:32:46] <$OdysseyKnight> Yeah
[3:32:47] <ThePowerOfRa420> FUCK THIS GOD DAMN SCENE
[3:32:48] <TalisKanju> What you didn't know is that his hand was glued to the ledge with industrial strength adhesive

[3:33:03] <%LifesNeverHumDrum> @mars_driver his adopted parents beat the French out of him
[3:33:03] <%ThePushaMan> HE YELLS at the old man "WHO IS THE KILLER?!"
[3:33:05] <elementofloyalty> PAT IS EVERYWHERE
[3:33:11] <@Calek> how does an overweight asthmatic person go all kungfu in earlier scenes and not die
[3:33:11] <@corn_on_fire> so then why did he even give them oragami
[3:33:16] <SchroedingersFerret> And by two I mean there are three giant problems
[3:33:17] <+cvp5127> you smash
[3:33:17] <Doctadaking> Is Shelby just the richest man alive?
[3:33:22] <ShimmerFairy> @PeachSaliva How did you figure it's Scott before the reveal?
[3:33:22] <%maskedriderhero> Why make all this evidence if you are going to hunt it down and burn it
[3:33:22] <elementofloyalty> Lauren
[3:33:23] <$MGKBurrito> Why no fire alarm?
[3:33:25] <+thesw1tch> @peachsaliva she spits on his grave

[3:33:34] <%MightyMaxT> She spits on him
[3:33:35] <@Moobot> Do you have a Fanfiction for Paige to read? Submit it to us here and it may get read on stream! http://bit.ly/2jsxJo9
[3:33:36] <pariasa> if he is alive she kills him

[3:33:37] <%Doctor_Death_Bed> plot burning
[3:33:37] <Hydrapissed> I have a flip phone
[3:33:39] <+AmaniIsYourBoss> Scott doesn't have the money to keep that factory's electricity on, fuck off Cage.
[3:33:40] <seniorwhiteface> NOkia
[3:33:40] <Travian_Valoris> Cop pension can afford to run a derelict power plant
[3:33:41] <clonexsniperx> so how does he afford everything?
[3:33:42] <+KittenHachiChan18> Because Cage doesn't believe in strong female characters for this
[3:33:44] <+KittenHachiChan18> shit
[3:33:44] <DagetSparrow> Good lick burning a phone dipshit
[3:33:44] <+Dingus_Tickler> Shelby is Namtab
[3:33:44] <+FadingEmber> You don't set phones on fire!

[3:34:16] <WaitHowDidIGetHere> @thepushaman To be fair, that could be explained as keeping his cover.
[3:34:17] <%AlopekisPup> Yes, Paige killed the prostitute. Her blood lust cannot be satisfied. @flying_man_3
[3:34:19] <+Dingus_Tickler> LUL OLD MAN ON OLD MAN CRIMES LUL

[3:34:27] <+tiburon108> LIES
[3:34:28] <TheRealSentaiSenpai> How the hell did Scott have any time to watch Ethan's progress through the cameras if he was out collecting evidence/interrogating people he knew wasn't the killer?

[3:34:35] <+ScrubingtonTheThird> THE WHOLE GAME
[3:34:36] <DevotedlyDragonesque> It's not even a lie of omission. It's just a lie.
[3:34:38] <deviljhojho94> UNPLUGGED
[3:34:39] <SkyPirateArcane> NO EXCUSE
[3:34:43] <leinadtonu> unreliable narrator
[3:34:44] <@PlagueOfGripes> The game wasn't lying. The game hadn't invented the idea that he was the killer yet
[3:34:45] <+MrMcCrabby> and it's not just that scene
[3:34:45] <+KittenHachiChan18> FUCK THIS GAME
[3:34:46] <+ymorn> Unreliable narrator
[3:34:46] <zal_silverfang> ahh, this salt is so lovely
[3:34:47] <@Calek> there's unreliable narrator, and then it just lies
[3:34:48] <Hawkbone_> The game just fucking lies to your face and then tries to pretend that its so clever and deep.
[3:34:51] <SuperSaiyanSora> 21! doodKen
[3:34:53] <+Grayhammatter> she's got alzheimers
[3:34:55] <$OdysseyKnight> Because he muscled in on his turf
[3:34:56] <SwindlerOfProgress> He thinks fake thoughts previously, too.
[3:34:57] <+ScrubingtonTheThird> Just lying. David Cage is and has always been.... a lying bytch
[3:35:00] <%Doctor_Death_Bed> @PeachSaliva don't forget that during the attack at the club Shelby is obviously taller and thinner than he actually is?
[3:35:01] <%wizkid50000> He's Deranged, Pat
[3:35:01] <the_phantom_theif> Mental problems?
[3:35:03] <generalve> Cause cramer killed somthing
[3:35:03] <$OdysseyKnight> That makes some sense
[3:35:04] <+PipIV> 10 years
[3:35:05] <+KittenHachiChan18> BECAUSE PLOT
[3:35:07] <+AncelDeLambert> an unreliable narrator twists the truth, this LIES
[3:35:08] <elementofloyalty> David Cage script

[3:35:20] <+KittenHachiChan18> ANF FUCK THIS MUSIC
[3:35:22] <Therazgrizsnake> Is that the script?
[3:35:22] <%wizkid50000> He is a psycho, he's a serial killer
[3:35:22] <+AXL808> selective Trauma memory loss
[3:35:25] <+LogothX> Its about to get even dumber
[3:35:26] <+Ryan1016> He gets skinnier as the origami killer LUL
[3:35:26] <SuperSaiyanSora> Shelby killed 21 people plus the 8 kids he drowned = 29 people Shelby has killed
[3:35:26] <EuropantLamprey> That's how you make a good twist, just lie to the player
[3:35:27] <deviljhojho94> fuck cage, and fuck quebec

[3:35:31] <%TrevyWeaponsGuy> Wouldn't the smoke just fill up the room
[3:35:32] <+PipIV> 10 years without a visit for mama
[3:35:32] <Doctadaking> What happened to his asthma?
[3:35:32] <CrypticMochi> Also all da money for his saw games
[3:35:34] <+G_Thunders> Also he killed 20 people as Shelby, not the Origami killer. So he’s screwed either way
[3:35:34] <LiquidMathew> glass in the tunnels too
[3:35:34] <+SailingSaturn> Does that Apartment have no sprinklers?
[3:35:37] <energywarning> just trick'em
[3:35:38] <rytisone> but what about psychic link?
[3:35:39] <%Freelance7> PIs don't get that much money
[3:35:40] <+ScrubingtonTheThird> You can't let me read your murderer's thoughts and have him be completely dissonant
[3:35:41] <%Remery_> So he killed a fake Origami killer because the guy was being a poser to him?
[3:35:42] <%LifesNeverHumDrum> let the hate flow through you y'all
[3:35:43] <+Nefarious_Bear> Private eyes, they're watching you
[3:35:44] <Firesparks> time for madison to die
[3:35:44] <Shastafield> nah fuck that
[3:35:45] <+Scythe275> @PeachSaliva Pat,you should also explain the removed blackout explanation
[3:35:45] <+krawtch> its like a fucking little kid who tells you a riddle but fucks up the details and then acts so smart when you cant figure out the answer because HE FUCKED UP
[3:35:46] <+AXL808> unpaid PI
[3:35:48] <circular7> rich family
[3:35:49] <rhus> I always looked at it like Shelby was trying to frame Kramer so he could get away after destroying the evidence
[3:35:50] <$GohanEgret> OH NO LUL
[3:35:51] <Travian_Valoris> David couldn't have
[3:35:52] <+Camail> LUL

[3:35:54] <$joylent_blue> more sense, but much worse
[3:35:55] <+pleasenameyourcharacter> Bear with me... I like Mass Effect, Mass Effect 3's ending was batshit stupid, this makes that look like fucking ART.
[3:35:56] <ThePowerOfRa420> LUL
[3:35:59] <$OdysseyKnight> Yep, he killed the fake because he dared to steal his schtick
[3:36:01] <+tiburon108> Well for that last one, he was mad that there was a copycat, right?
[3:36:01] <+StriderGerry> LUL
[3:36:02] <MissMalisin> The blackouts
[3:36:03] <SurvivalShotgun> P S Y C H I C L I N K

[3:36:05] <+ScrubingtonTheThird> Doesn't think about how he killed those kids even ONCE, he just never thought about it LUL
[3:36:06] <SchroedingersFerret> And his siphoning of millions of watts of electricity
[3:36:07] <$Dungeon00X> Heavy Rain! The game that straight up lies to you!

[3:49:30] <+Corvax__> Pat can you please ask how she keeps pressing the menu button
[3:49:30] <Ell1ot> i thought Matt saved the lady
[3:49:31] <cassyasg> no woolie did
[3:49:31] <TheRealSentaiSenpai> Paige killed a prostitute in order to save a child murderer
[3:49:31] <WorldSoup5> man
[3:49:31] <17sevens> and Woolie
[3:49:31] <+AmaniIsYourBoss> Pat, I salute you for going through this shit 3 times
[3:49:33] <MissMalisin> Where's Elmo?
[3:49:33] <pimpinahz> call Matt. get him to throw an axe at the kid
[3:49:34] <%Doctor_Death_Bed> @PeachSaliva Hey Pat did you notice during the club fight that Shelby is actually taller and slimmer than he actually is? He must have lost the weight to trick the player
[3:49:34] <+tiburon108> Woolie
[3:49:34] <Cptn_Turtle> And Woolie
[3:49:35] <Firesparks> the LP was perfect run
[3:49:35] <Hawkbone_> Literally everyone I've seen play this killed Lauren there
[3:49:35] <Quibbis> Uh Matt saved her dude
[3:49:35] <TalisKanju> This game existing is proof that we're in the DARKEST timeline
[3:49:35] <grayjammer> Ity was woolie who made that mistake
[3:49:35] <%AlopekisPup> Pat, what's wrong with your current $3k video card that makes you want a new one? @PeachSaliva
[3:49:35] <%CaptainPileDriver> sipsipSipsipblind sipsipSipsipblind
[3:49:35] <+SailingSaturn> Woolie
[3:49:36] <DagetSparrow> Somewhere in the distance, The Cage Effect makes Woolie quits SBFP
[3:49:36] <Snaketsu> THE FRIDGE HUH PAT?
[3:49:39] <+LordLicoriceThe3rd> you have to press that prompt twice
[3:49:39] <$waltzqueen> @PeachSaliva when is omikron attempt 1-57?
[3:49:40] <generalve> PAT YOU HYPED
[3:49:40] <+PipIV> whip your weenus out
[3:49:40] <CptJeezus> it's not clear that you have to save her before breaking open the window
[3:49:41] <BreakersAweigh> well, i mean that's a natural reaction
[3:49:41] <DraxTD> @PeachSaliva Pat Loran lived in your LP
[3:49:41] <bakedcheeseman> Lol
[3:49:41] <Meekest> It's such a bad prompt
[3:49:43] <DeathByPoke7> i hope the sean audio bug is still in the game
[3:49:43] <EuropantLamprey> W O O L I E
[3:49:44] <Laecerelius> The gun is good!
[3:49:45] <%wizkid50000> Pat, you missed m ysub from way earlier :(
[3:49:45] <+ScrubingtonTheThird> Like mega unclear
[3:49:45] <logandh3> Woolie killed Lauren too
[3:49:45] <+Toynota10> @peachsaliva you play the game in french?
[3:49:45] <GarbageQueenEllie> Genocide Ending!
[3:49:48] <Hawkbone_> Free Elmo
[3:49:48] <%ThePushaMan> man
[3:49:48] <Sapphire_Breeze> how did Shelby scatter that glass
[3:49:49] <Sozu_> This means Pat is basically dating Woolie :o
[3:49:49] <+Joseph_Stark> Yeah but at least Lauren died IN LOVE
[3:49:53] <%RaikenTB> RE2 stream tomorrow?
[3:49:54] <MissMalisin> R1
[3:49:54] <elementofloyalty> Pat slows down your chat
[3:49:55] <Doctadaking> Can we PLEASE get the Shaun bug
[3:49:56] <clonexsniperx> i wonder how many scenes in detroit needed to be cut out
[3:49:59] <%ThePushaMan> quite a lot of similarities between paige an woollie
[3:49:59] <generalve> @PeachSaliva You ever thought of streaming some wii game with dolphin ?
[3:49:59] <%alex_id> Just like he shot an unarmed man
[3:49:59] <Zaver88> Woolie killed more people
[3:49:59] <Saiyza> Woolie "Glass Him" Madden?
[3:50:01] <Firesparks> woolie killed jayden thou
[3:50:02] <mr_slaide> And he killed that guy at football.
[3:50:03] <$waltzqueen> paige=better wooloie
[3:50:03] <%CaptainPileDriver> what's still the worst david cage game after omikron?
[3:50:04] <fireking900> Woolie also killed Jayden
[3:50:04] <tUxUt> paige is just woolue
[3:50:04] <prime_name> IS WOOLIE YOUR GIRLFRIEND?!
[3:50:04] <Travian_Valoris> didn't kill drug man either
[3:50:05] <+SailingSaturn> and was super pissed about it LUL
[3:50:05] <alwayspronking> Its like the prompts are very badly made
[3:50:06] <%ThePushaMan> youre dating wooolie
[3:50:07] <+flying_hipp0> woolie kill prostitute?
[3:50:07] <ShadowZiggy> Paige and Woolie are one in the same
[3:50:07] <$flying_man_3> Paige is true better Wollie
[3:50:08] <+letjaeeol> sbfpVita
[3:50:08] <$Dutchpotato> yeah but Paige didn't get norman Jayden killed
[3:50:09] <+thesw1tch> pat is dating woolie confirmed
[3:50:09] <Papako> It's almost like the prompts are bad.
[3:50:09] <LiquidMathew> Woolie at least killed him on the fake out, not just gunning him down
[3:50:09] <leadenstrides> Paige is better Woolie to be fair
[3:50:10] <hazardkujacker> Woolie "Mistakes into More Mistajes" Madden
[3:50:10] <+pleasenameyourcharacter> @peachsaliva Pat, are you getting a Purple Heart for this brave service of 3 Heavy Rain LP's?
[3:50:11] <%furiousfurioso> woolie killed nahman though
[3:50:11] <leinadtonu> She's doing way better than Woolz, tho
[3:50:12] <IminyourBase> woolie is paige..PAIGE IS WOOLIE
[3:50:13] <%SSaryn> I really don't understand.. The Prompts are actually really clearly laid out. AND ON YOUR PAUSE SCREEN.
[3:50:13] <+tiburon108> Woolie went on a rampage
[3:50:13] <rytisone> Woolie also played the video game
[3:50:13] <mrjohncarlton> Is Paige really Woolie? Kappa
[3:50:13] <Spydurman> Pat you catch the Can't Breath reference in Become Hooman?
[3:50:14] <NemokillerV> did wookilie make the same mistake?
[3:50:14] <the_phantom_theif> Hey Pat, are you Gonna try out Dx2 Liberation?
[3:50:14] <Doctadaking> R1 meme
[3:50:15] <ludwigvonholyblade> paige and woolie are soul-linked
[3:50:15] <turf_wind_and_fire> Quick! Check Paige for hidden dreads and reboot buttons!
[3:50:15] <BreakersAweigh> Therefore, Paige = Woolie.
[3:50:16] <Zaver88> Woolie killed Jayden and left Lauren I believe
[3:50:16] <+ScrubingtonTheThird> Nice
[3:50:16] <invader_rin> #WoolieLivesMatter
[3:50:17] <ElementalX1000> History is doomed to repeat itself
[3:50:17] <+Sp3ctre48> Woolie killed Nahmen though
[3:50:17] <+Hilleltaco> Woolie shot him for very similar reasons
[3:50:18] <%SuperCasualBoom> Who the worse killer? Paige or Woolie?
[3:50:18] <%wizkid50000> Are you mad there is no zapping system
[3:50:18] <Quibbis> God the Paige is Woolie lore from a while ago is still going strong
[3:50:19] <generalve> @PeachSaliva PAT FINISH ACE ATTOREY
[3:50:19] <SuperSaiyanSora> Paige is kinda doing better than Woolie
[3:50:20] <%CaptainPileDriver> ask her how her poop was
[3:50:20] <CptJeezus> did Shelby expect no one to wonder why a propane tank exploded in his apartment, and why he has a secret room?
[3:50:21] <elementofloyalty> @PeachSaliva limber up
[3:50:23] <Too_Much_Nukie> Woolie got Norman killed though.
[3:50:24] <DagetSparrow> Yes Elmo.
[3:50:25] <+krawtch> Paige = 0.98 Woolies
[3:50:25] <TalisKanju> DO Leon A Claire B
[3:50:26] <seniorwhiteface> Tofu Run?
[3:50:26] <%ziriken> matt saved lauren
[3:50:26] <%AlopekisPup> Pat unpause the game now!
[3:50:27] <pimpinahz> Get Paige to fail saving the kid
[3:50:27] <Killbones> @peachsaliva I think the absolutely most idiotic thing about the reveal is that the game gives you a dedicated internal monologue button, and in almost every scene shelby thinks about the killer like he's another person
[3:50:27] <Stevie0g> At least they are on the same paige
[3:50:29] <NopeBadguy> @PeachSaliva Pat, Ethan and Shelby can't die before endgame
[3:50:29] <+Dingus_Tickler> Chewie x Fuckface is my OTP sbfpSOB <3 sbfpMember
[3:50:29] <The_Sorrow_> HOW BOUT THAT PART 5 THO
[3:50:34] <Itsandrewbaby> play re2 or ill never forgive you
[3:50:34] <+Kaiser_Loar> She is like Wolly. When you give them guns.
[3:50:35] <Doctadaking> I expected Paige to be angrier
[3:50:35] <logandh3> The biggest difference between their playthroughs is that Woolie killed Jayden
[3:50:36] <%HyperCharge_Sam> also he killed detective guy
[3:50:37] <BROKENVenom_X> is paige gonna play Detroit after this?
[3:50:37] <elementofloyalty> SNACKS
[3:50:37] <+Wiseblood_79> Woolie didn't get his dick wet though
[3:50:38] <+MarshallLee67> but woolie killed jayden lol
[3:50:38] <Zaver88> And Jayden died
[3:50:40] <TalisKanju> LEON A // CLAIRE B
[3:50:40] <bakedcheeseman> Indian paige and the origami killer
[3:50:40] <$mister___doctor> Are Paige and Woolie the same person? Thag would be weird
[3:50:43] <+AntithesisEK> "WOOLIE SHOT JESUS"
[3:50:45] <Vroom0> Mistakes? LUL
[3:50:47] <+Ssaik> was it even a mistake by Woolie
[3:50:47] <grayjammer> Paige didn't fuck up Norman at the mad jack part tho
[3:50:49] <elementofloyalty> STRONG
[3:50:49] <Ser_Randal> Woolie was the fuck throufh
[3:50:50] <%furiousfurioso> you're forgetting that woolie killed nahman
[3:50:50] <VritraReiRei> @PeachSaliva but you didn't kill NORMAN JAYDEN!
[3:50:51] <+ScrubingtonTheThird> Paige has a living Nahman tho
[3:50:52] <%ThePushaMan> pls dont play detroit
[3:50:54] <SwiftFission> pat is dating woolie confirmed yet again
[3:50:54] <leinadtonu> Jayden died alson
[3:50:54] <Doctadaking> Woolie got Jayden killed though
[3:50:56] <+Ssaik> I thought he was still super salty and wanted to kill
[3:50:56] <+krawtch> Pat is basically dating Woolie at this point
[3:50:58] <%CaptainPileDriver> woolie didn't do that
[3:50:58] <HatingSince87> no, Woolie saved the girl
[3:50:59] <fireking900> wait she got MORE FOOD?
[3:50:59] <%AlopekisPup> Paige actually did better than Woolie this time.
[3:51:00] <%Rybuca> Woolie killed Jayden too
[3:51:00] <DagetSparrow> Goes to bathroom. Comes back with McDonalds
[3:51:00] <$Dutchpotato> I still love woolied defense to killing that guy LUL
[3:51:02] <+MightyOwl95> For once, Paige is not better Woolie!?
[3:51:02] <Zaver88> Which didn't happen with Woolie
[3:51:02] <wsintai> Except for Lauren. Lauren dead as shiiiit
[3:51:03] <$rdark_ksu> to bad Paige's best is McDonald's teir
[3:51:03] <+DamnKrazy> WOOLIE VS JESUS
[3:51:03] <gsoto83> Expect for the hooker
[3:51:04] <Edwardsjack> The sacrifice?
[3:51:05] <+AncelDeLambert> Cold victory VVdonalds
[3:51:06] <shurtal> Is Pressing R1 at the wrong/correct time the Zapping System?
[3:51:06] <%CaptainPileDriver> fooooooooooooooooooood
[3:51:07] <xbb1024> It makes sense that Wollie would shoot
[3:51:10] <%SSaryn> Time for 20 minutes OF BULLSHIT
[3:51:10] <GarbageQueenEllie> But I wanted the Genocide Ending!
[3:51:10] <%AlopekisPup> Pretty sure Woolie didn't save her
[3:51:12] <+Grayhammatter> big and strong
[3:51:13] <elementofloyalty> Paige is better than PAt
[3:51:17] <+krawtch> hidden wcdonalds
[3:51:17] <Ell1ot> did you wash your hands, Paige?
[3:51:17] <$lewisferret> ill pay a thousand for pat or peach to strem the next day
[3:51:19] <DraxTD> @PeachSaliva Pat can Shelby drown and what happens if so?
[3:51:20] <TalisKanju> How many times must Pat be present for a Heavy Rain playthrough?
[3:51:25] <cassyasg> she's doing the thing super good
[3:51:30] <%umbypokochan> i can't believe Vinnie Paul died....
[3:51:31] <+ScrubingtonTheThird> Definitely her fastest game run

[4:09:11] <AirlineFood74> @PeachSaliva no that's the best ending. Norman doesn't get good endings
[4:09:12] <Kaitepaints> Good job Paige, never forget, never forgive
[4:09:13] <Too_Much_Nukie> Use the glasses less throughout the game.

[4:09:19] <NopeBadguy> @PeachSaliva Yes, having Norman give up prevents that ending
[4:09:19] <AlasterAngelo> best ending for Jayden is him quitting before solving the case

[4:19:34] <Laironx3> SSHHHH
[4:19:35] <Quibbis> AlopekisPup that's happened to multiple family members, and is super accurate
[4:19:35] <AlasterAngelo> dragon's dogma's ending is hella bleak mang
[4:19:35] <hypoid77> hookers
[4:19:41] <Dethhollow> After this mystery we could go into a more intricate mystery series *Danganrompa*

[4:20:25] <mrjohncarlton> "Look at this tiny man struggle!"
[4:20:26] <+FrostMass22> I totally forgot the ending to Dragon's Dogma
[4:20:27] <zaptar13> @krawtch it was me. i logged into your paypai
[4:20:27] <+Grayhammatter> was this even a mystery if the game actually legitimately lied to your face?
[4:20:28] <Havren13> It's probably the work week where those beers don't see the trash can until the cleaning crew see it first
[4:20:30] <@MelBrooksKA> I had my credit card bounce for a 100 Yen The Good Life support

[4:58:47] <%AlopekisPup> I love the idea of space
[4:58:48] <rytisone> Quantic Dream worked around David Cage
[4:58:48] <%SuichiTanaka> The empty VOID all around us
[4:58:49] <Doctadaking> Everything about Madison is creep and horrible
[4:58:50] <+krawtch> how do you cut a hologram?
[4:58:50] <grayjammer> Because androids need to be able to have the functionality to hide their identity at a momen't s notice
[4:58:52] <elementofloyalty> :D
[4:58:52] <GarbageQueenEllie> You mean the INFINITE VOID?
[4:58:53] <Ell1ot> Pat's dead
[4:58:53] <Niney_Who> Paige believes in Lovecraft's work
[4:58:55] <+pleasenameyourcharacter> wow, i was right earlier, Cage is a AAA SFM softcore porn artist. every new bit of info makes that more believable.
[4:58:56] <+KSabot> Paige is Agoraphobic
[4:58:59] <+AncelDeLambert> Other people were intimately involved with Detroit, and have succesfully squelched Cage's influence

[4:59:13] <+AntithesisEK> it's mostly Dark Energy, then stars, then places that just explode you cause they're too hot / cold.
[4:59:14] <Everpresent_Overseer> Space is the true cosmic horror
[4:59:15] <%BLACKHALO9> Isn't the Madison's model banging Guy Ritchie?

[4:59:23] <DantesAnimus> So we need to make Paige play Soma
[4:59:25] <SGrim> @PeachSaliva compared to the universe on both sides, massive and microscopic, you really don't matter in the scheme of things. Take comfort in this. rooBlank

[5:12:58] <$rdark_ksu> hawaii is nice, also dolphins feel like rubber
[5:12:58] <$RubberFistFight> @FrostMass22 that idea would probably freak pat the fuck out, considering how seriously he takes the concept of his own mortality and survival.

[5:15:55] <%RaikenTB> shelby also can't be 48.
[5:15:57] <+ScrubingtonTheThird> The story is just bad
[5:15:57] <benswanny> C A G E

[5:16:04] <Press_X_ToJASON> is shelby 43 or 48?
[5:16:06] <+krawtch> Are you prepared to suffer to wipe your ass?
[5:16:09] <Doctadaking> Because Cage is a shit writer
[5:16:09] <@Moobot> Do you have a Fanfiction for Paige to read? Submit it to us here and it may get read on stream! http://bit.ly/2jsxJo9
[5:16:13] <puddingpants88> why would the cops think he's the killer? the coma literally clears him
[5:16:15] <fireking900> 48
[5:16:16] <+ThatGuyfromMars> @Niney_Who lady smegma exists. What a world we live in.
[5:16:18] <zal_silverfang> last hour paige
[5:16:19] <SGrim> @Press_X_ToJASON 48 according to the epilogue
[5:16:24] <DedlokPM> @Press_X_ToJASON I recall them saying he was 48
[5:16:26] <+ScrubingtonTheThird> If the kid died 30 years ago how is Scott almost 50? Bad writer
[5:16:27] <+AncelDeLambert> Blake is a moron
[5:16:28] <Stebdavee> what about Madison's insomnia or Shelby's athsma
[5:16:31] <+srkAres> just leave it in until we fall asleep together
[5:16:32] <%ziriken> i dont think he was in a coma?
[5:16:32] <+LordLicoriceThe3rd> there doesnt need to be a reason that shaun was kidnapped
[5:16:36] <Darren716> His grave says 1967-2011 though
[5:16:37] <+RafflesiaA> @Niney_Who Don't they also have really strong vag muscles or something? I remember reading that somewhere years ago
[5:16:38] <Press_X_ToJASON> @DedlokPM but his gravestone makes him 43
[5:16:42] <Tearonex> it's almost if when you look closer at the story the whole thing smells of a hack
[5:16:42] <elementofloyalty> good night
[5:16:46] <+ScrubingtonTheThird> He also cant count
[5:16:53] <Kaitepaints> Remember in beyond two souls that using aiden hurt Jodi and it never came up again
[5:16:55] <+AncelDeLambert> It's almost like Cage can't write
[5:16:55] <puddingpants88> water on the brain
[5:17:00] <$RubberFistFight> @Niney_Who well i mean HUMAN vaginal lubrication has a similar function, just not as powerful as what you're describing up there. So it makes sense there'd be a similarity of sorts.
[5:17:04] <GarbageQueenEllie> Isn't insephilitus that head exploding disease?
[5:17:05] <Niney_Who> @RafflesiaA Yeah if they want to fuck they're gonna get it. They use the jelly and rub against a male to make them super into it, then lock them in once it starts
[5:17:11] <+pleasenameyourcharacter> someone call the mods, we need an adult to stop this so we can sleep
[5:17:12] <reonome> oof
[5:17:15] <DedlokPM> They said 48 tho. Pretty certain @Press_X_ToJASON rooShrug
[5:17:16] <%SaltyDongs> 999 damage
[5:17:17] <+krawtch> remember in beyond: two souls when jodie feels aiden get shot one time but not the other 23 times
[5:17:23] <Doctadaking> Remember in Beyond how Aiden’s max distance from Jodie changed every scene?

[5:17:47] <GarbageQueenEllie> Clear Bile isn't so bad
[5:17:50] <+AncelDeLambert> Remember in Beyond how Jodie goes outside in the freezing cold to pee?

[5:18:12] <seniorwhiteface> Well wont complain about my torn shoulder any more
[5:18:23] <Kaitepaints> Two crimes cancel out each other
[5:18:24] <Doctadaking> Remember how Jodie and Ryan survive in the Arctic after swimming in freezing water with little clothing
[5:18:25] <puddingpants88> it happened 32 minutes ago
[5:18:27] <+kzkinthemorning> Paige i know that. I lost 40 pounds in 2 weeks

[5:30:40] <%Bonkasaurusrex> I appreciate Paige saying Melbourne correctly.
[5:30:42] <TalisKanju> The best part of Australia is that most of the country is considered the Outback

[5:31:23] <sosuke5> Space water?
[5:31:24] <SGrim> Fun, but unprovable, idea: some Linguists postulate that the Australian accident is the remnants of the drunk slur of the original convict settlers. rooKb
[5:31:25] <Bouldus> @RubberFistFight shitfaced, stoned, or both

[5:32:20] <SatansDick1> sewage spill??????
[5:32:20] <+Arkfyre> toxic sewage runoff river
[5:32:21] <+ScrubingtonTheThird> A waterfall sewer
[5:32:22] <ShimmerFairy> Hey Paige you should play SOMA Kappa
[5:32:24] <Niney_Who> That's how you get Gonnorhea
[5:32:24] <+Hilleltaco> I can't really go underwater ever. Probably stems from that time my brother pushed me into a pool and just kind of assumed I could swim. Only worked out because my mom asked where I was
[5:32:28] <+thesw1tch> that's fucking disgusting
[5:32:29] <leinadtonu> The sewage treatment plant?
[5:32:30] <turf_wind_and_fire> Kinda like a damn. It controls the level of water
[5:32:30] <$RubberFistFight> @PeachSaliva tell him it's a WEIR - it's basically like a fun water slide, only it's really likely to kill you.
[5:32:31] <SpaceCaptainCrone> A spillway is a channel of water made to prevent flooding
[5:32:32] <GameBoyAdvance> "secretly fuck"wtf
[5:32:32] <Kaitepaints> Radiation sounds fun
[5:32:33] <fireking900> Make Paige play SOMA

[5:32:44] <TalisKanju> @ThatGuyfromMars Why would anyone fight you? You're totally right
[5:32:47] <+ScrubingtonTheThird> A waterfall sewer where dumb teens bone
[5:32:48] <Kaitepaints> Radiation and cum
[5:32:49] <grayjammer> I'm gonna have to agree. Paige should absolutely play Soma
[5:32:51] <Niney_Who> Now you HAVE To play it
[5:32:51] <seniorwhiteface> Just a hobo shitting in the corner
[5:32:54] <+krawtch> swimming is a natural survival instinct that you do before you drown
[5:32:56] <+ThatGuyfromMars> @TalisKanju damn right
[5:33:01] <+TheGershon> Do big handstands at the bottom of the pool and hope you don't die by the time you come back up
[5:33:03] <puddingpants88> @kaitepaints so Spider-Man
[5:33:05] <SGrim> @PeachSaliva a spill-way is an artifical tributary to divert excess ground water from cities. Many are made by carving out riverbeds, some are made of concrete, and some are made of metal.
[5:33:06] <@Calek> Jessica and Max got through Overcooked pretty alright
[5:33:10] <ELuscious> @PeachSaliva PLAY PORTAL TOGETHER
