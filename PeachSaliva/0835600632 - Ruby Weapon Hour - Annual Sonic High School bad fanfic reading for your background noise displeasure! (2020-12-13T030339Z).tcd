[0:45:08] <$thefunkiestpunkiest> BibleThump100 I have a suggestion, if you don't mind. When a word comes up that you don't want to say, maybe say GAMER? I think it fits regardless of the situation. Love your fanfic reading either way, hope you're having a good day! BibleThump100

[0:45:24] <thefunkiestpunkiest> @Chuckgofer I think it's a good look into the mind of a hormonal boy.
[0:45:25] <ThespianBarrage> It feels like it was written by an awesome CHAD...
[0:45:26] <BigLoserJosh> I hope we get to emo sonic
[0:45:26] <%JobbedBone> is good

[0:45:59] <+ek117> suprised we didn't get tails and sonic on the bed
[0:46:00] <thefunkiestpunkiest> What if a graveyard of you is just all the times you should have died in your life?
[0:46:00] <soledadarts> Amy will sex the Eggman
[0:46:00] <%jillpilled> WE MUST HEAR
[0:46:01] <SulfurousAcid> she says

[0:46:02] <$rdark_ksu> isn't this the story with the "put a generation in me" ?

[0:46:13] <soledadarts> borger
[0:46:14] <RyuuAoi> Give Gief a bite!
[0:46:17] <thefunkiestpunkiest> Pat died the way he lived, loving his dog.
[0:46:19] <foolylagoony> Paige, you like a spicy chicken mayo?
[0:46:21] <+lazerscraper> did it start??
[0:46:22] <%walternatorz> @PeachSaliva when does the movie get greenlit?
[0:46:26] <thefunkiestpunkiest> That sounds really bad without context
[0:46:32] <+Anime_Flux> I just assumed it was written by an AI
[0:46:37] <thefunkiestpunkiest> @tizz86 Were they really twelve?
[0:46:39] <cache_22> Other than the slurs and racism, it’s pretty much what I expected.
[0:46:42] <coreyyotto> Probably a teenager at the very least
[0:46:42] <ExpressNode> If so they wrote it just like one
[0:46:43] <tanarath> I dunno, Paige
[0:46:49] <Chuckgofer> Better than Ready Player One
[0:46:51] <This_side_up_153> What does all the symbolism of this story mean though?
[0:46:52] <ahaegotrigger> its someone that wanted to Write the My Immortal of Sonic fanfic
[0:46:53] <goblinpuppy> no way this was earnestly written
[0:46:55] <thefunkiestpunkiest> I appreciate how it's taking the piss out of most of ***
[0:46:55] <%Ranryu692> I assume English isn't the author's first language
[0:46:59] <Broken_Sonex> It's quite gripping, i would say.
[0:47:01] <pipboy344> When is game awards going on youtube?
[0:47:02] <coreyyotto> no my immortal is still worse
[0:47:02] <%CoreyOfMyLife> Whoever wrote it deserves a pulitzer
[0:47:06] <+MidnightBurst12> balls
[0:47:07] <tanarath> I'm pretty sure that a child of some kind wrote this.
[0:47:07] <RyuuAoi> Idk sounds pretty kiddie to me
[0:47:08] <+Dew217> So she realy Is she just reading Sonichu but not showing the pictures
[0:47:09] <jacewolf_is_the_best> his childhood
[0:47:09] <segychan> the balls are inert
[0:47:10] <thelonechris> Angst
[0:47:10] <ThespianBarrage> No, it's our lost innocence.
[0:47:11] <@SoFarFetched> never,it got deleted.
[0:47:11] <%Sotetsu> Mankind's eternal struggle

[0:47:28] <prime_name> Awww
[0:47:29] <%Agami23> it symbolizes the pain of the youths
[0:47:31] <%Aztec50> game awards have many DMCA
[0:47:32] <%king_wragles> @PeachSaliva Sonic's balls represent the grip of the bourgeoise has on the proletariat
[0:47:33] <+cvp5127> corporations suck
[0:47:33] <foolylagoony> L O S T M E D I A :(
[0:47:34] <%naph_runs> whys that? im out of the loop
[0:47:35] <KikioJane> his itchy balls represent his fear of losing Amy
[0:47:37] <%torusendor> Sonic's fear of intimacy
[0:47:38] <%Jack_of_No_Trades> Pubic anxiety?
[0:47:39] <%naph_runs> ahhhh ok
[0:47:41] <$rdark_ksu> thats the same with most other ppl too
[0:47:43] <%hairtoday> the balls are hope, and the disease is eggman bringing despair
[0:47:44] <Chuckgofer> Better to not risk it
[0:47:45] <%Agami23> hot
[0:47:45] <Jaller101514> @peachsaliva important question! which version of Sonic are you picturing? I have 90's cartoon sonic, personally.
[0:47:47] <@SoFarFetched> Paige didn't wanna deal with DMCA shenanigans because of the game awards
[0:47:50] <ExpressNode> That was a good decision
[0:47:52] <+ShinBojangles> dam i would have watched it if past broadcasts weren't locked
[0:47:52] <+badchoice5> well fuck me I guess
[0:47:53] <+Cozy90> o_o
[0:47:53] <This_side_up_153> like dr robotnik?
[0:47:56] <+Anime_Flux> Balls = the primitive duality of man...?
[0:47:56] <@SoFarFetched> well pipboy was shouting almost nonstop
[0:47:57] <%AtlasMcCoy> Wait, you DON'T want a bot to fuck you?
[0:47:58] <%jillpilled> I wish Schick Hydrobot would fuc me :(
[0:47:59] <%SaiyanShoto> Sephiroth though
[0:47:59] <AlexDaGr8> the only good parts of the VGAs were sephiroth and EVERYONE booing the game of the year
[0:47:59] <thefunkiestpunkiest> I think the balls symbolize Sonic's impotency. He can go fast, but he can never go slow. He can never enjoy the passion behind making love with his partner, he can only go through the motions. His stinky balls are a constant reminder he will never be pure. @PeachSaliva
[0:47:59] <$happyface699> Bots are very horny
[0:47:59] <%MyNameIsRasus> just mario dying
[0:48:02] <Zaphire_Saucypants> the balls must symbolize Sonic's growing fear of being stuck in the past that is his childhood.
[0:48:02] <thelonechris> Doom got robbed
[0:48:02] <pipboy344> That sucks ass
[0:48:03] <+RealThiele> elden ring delayed again
[0:48:03] <Zaver88> But Sephiroth
[0:48:03] <RyuuAoi> Y'all want her to get fucked?
[0:48:05] <+lethallylactic> FeelsBadMan
[0:48:06] <%bob900000> can't you still get dmca even if you delete it
[0:48:09] <+badchoice5> I wanted to see Pat's disappointment and the reaction to Mario's death
[0:48:13] <+HibiSuite> The power scaling with the Chaos Emeralds is limiting story potentials so they wanted to try with a new power system of Ballz
[0:48:16] <%Agami23> you missed geoff keighly getting on his knees for naughty dog
[0:48:17] <wasdknife> and the winner is... THE LOST OF US PART 2
[0:48:20] <thefunkiestpunkiest> I didn't watch the game awards, I had no interest in it. I just don't see the appeal of award shows?
[0:48:20] <@SoFarFetched> twitch was fixing that
[0:48:21] <pipboy344> I wanted to see Sep
[0:48:23] <Broken_Sonex> Sephiroth stabbed Mario. That's all you need to know
[0:48:24] <AlexDaGr8> across five streams i have seen NO ONE who liked that TLoU2 won GOTY
[0:48:26] <ExpressNode> How?
[0:48:27] <corepercentlives> we all somehow missed Elden Ring
[0:48:30] <%Promessa_EX> i mean we muted half of it
[0:48:32] <RyuuAoi> #GetSmoked
[0:48:36] <+ShinBojangles> is locking past broadcasts behind a sub a dmca thing also?
[0:48:36] <foolylagoony> bone
[0:48:38] <%MyNameIsRasus> tga is joke anyway
[0:48:40] <%jillpilled> Getting ghost-VOD DMCA's sound terrifying
[0:48:40] <%jerree66> Man that's the worst
[0:48:41] <thefunkiestpunkiest> I wonder if anyone farted at the game awards
[0:48:47] <pipboy344> I wanted to see Sephiroth
[0:48:50] <thefunkiestpunkiest> I want someone to let out an epic fart at the game awards
[0:48:53] <tanarath> @alexdagr8 don't forget about Devolver, Disco Elyseum, and the few awards that went to good games.
[0:48:54] <+RealThiele> i wasnt upset it was mostly ads
[0:48:54] <MarylandJutsu> compelled by jeeeesus
[0:48:57] <+gustavozxd> I had it open in another tab so whatever
[0:49:00] <%jerree66> This DMCA shit is getting way out of hand
[0:49:01] <$Quack_of_Dawn> Dude, one of the trailers had Space Oddity, you really don't want to risk it
[0:49:04] <%bob900000> pat
[0:49:04] <%SaiyanShoto> Pat would
[0:49:06] <thelonechris> Why not?
[0:49:06] <%hairtoday> beans
[0:49:09] <%MyNameIsRasus> Why wouldn't them
[0:49:09] <thefunkiestpunkiest> What's a DMCA
[0:49:11] <MarylandJutsu> Pat could
[0:49:12] <ThespianBarrage> This is all about Soren Kierkegaard's despair and Herbert Spencer's capitalist philosophy, who thought the government should interfere as little as possible with the free market.
[0:49:12] <+gustavozxd> most of the time I was too bored to actually turn the sound on LUL
[0:49:16] <thefunkiestpunkiest> Is that Devil May Cry Armageddon
[0:49:25] <%MyNameIsRasus> THE FART POLICE
[0:49:29] <thefunkiestpunkiest> BECAUSE A FART WOULD BE INTERESTING, PAIGE
[0:49:32] <coreyyotto> make it a bit
[0:49:33] <%Promessa_EX> i think the lady in the dress farted when she totally looked at those instagram submissions
[0:49:35] <%SaiyanShoto> He farts on your stream so why not on the stage?
[0:49:40] <%walternatorz> Pat is professional. He has standards.
[0:49:40] <MetalSlimeHunt> UGLY?! D:
[0:49:41] <RyuuAoi> On the stage, Pat
[0:49:41] <GrandMazterNelson> pull a rudy
[0:49:45] <Zeif00> I'd watch that
[0:49:45] <$NitronStreams> But thats when you have the most power
[0:49:49] <Kiraklene> Farts and passes out on stage
[0:49:54] <%MyNameIsRasus> BRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRAP
[0:49:54] <sydowoodo> oh no, is it ending? D:
[0:49:55] <@SoFarFetched> I would Pat
[0:49:55] <Ranryu692> they'd be fear farts
[0:49:56] <thefunkiestpunkiest> A FART WOULD MAKE THE GAME AWARDS INTERESTING, PAIGE. COME ON.
[0:49:56] <+ek117> it'd be appropriate for the game awaRDS
[0:49:56] <RyuuAoi> SHADE
[0:49:58] <Zeif00> You've done it before
[0:49:58] <This_side_up_153> but think of the views
[0:49:59] <Dhurkst> @AlexDaGr8 also Disco Elysium, Evil West, Back 4 Blood, and Darktide
[0:50:00] <%SaiyanShoto> We all know
[0:50:01] <%MyNameIsRasus> WE DO
[0:50:02] <%bob900000> pat and paige cohost
[0:50:02] <ExpressNode> I'd probably just shit my pants on stage
[0:50:05] <%Jack_of_No_Trades> I member not knowing
[0:50:05] <coreyyotto> I REMEMBERED
[0:50:05] <OvaltineDream> at magfest?
[0:50:05] <@SoFarFetched> ESPECIALLY me
[0:50:09] <%jillpilled> We know you do almost every stream
[0:50:09] <Broken_Sonex> Can someone just like..."Take care of" whoever is doing this DMCA shit?
[0:50:10] <MarylandJutsu> we know and Zangief knows
[0:50:10] <%SirGO0SE> hes too scared he'll poop em
[0:50:10] <ahaegotrigger> I cant believe Pat Farts
[0:50:10] <%Sotetsu> Now I know
[0:50:12] <%MyNameIsRasus> YOU'RE FARTING RIGHT NOW
[0:50:13] <ThespianBarrage> Are Pat's balls out RIGHT NOW?
[0:50:16] <pipboy344> @sofarfetched Only at the muting. I can only watch 1 stream, not two for sound
[0:50:18] <thefunkiestpunkiest> @ExpressNode Do it after announcing the game of the year.
[0:50:19] <%SaiyanShoto> Are there clips of him farting on stream?
[0:50:22] <%bob900000> finally
[0:50:28] <foolylagoony> I hope he gets memed to deth
[0:50:33] <thefunkiestpunkiest> @ExpressNode Just poop your pants after announcing the game of the year
[0:50:38] <$Quack_of_Dawn> Next time you order delivery just imagine how many farts are trapped in his car seat
[0:50:40] <thefunkiestpunkiest> It'll be a political statement.
[0:50:41] <+arancet> wait, what place?
[0:50:46] <MarylandJutsu> Death by glamor? no death by meme
[0:50:52] <+arancet> i live there damnit!
[0:50:54] <ThespianBarrage> No one will want to fight you if you shit yourself in the middle of a fight.
[0:50:55] <2DSuperiority> announce the winner as Among Ass Imposter is Sus
[0:50:59] <+Anime_Flux> The best kept secret on Twitch
[0:50:59] <%SaiyanShoto> Its a wendys
[0:51:00] <+NWR_James> SHARE THE CHILLI
[0:51:00] <ExpressNode> @thefunkiestpunkiest That would be the highest note of the year as well as the brownest note
[0:51:02] <sydowoodo> but the chili
[0:51:02] <%MyNameIsRasus> @thefunkiestpunkiest it'll be a better political statement that TLOU2 ayyyyyyyyyyyyyyy
[0:51:04] <+bobfriskit> is it Chili's?
[0:51:07] <Valdorick> Could the reason no one knows about it be because of the shit inducing food?
[0:51:09] <Dakuu75> I'm curious how many ppl think Pat was right, that Fenyx Rising sucks and how many think he's wrong. can we get a poll?
[0:51:12] <+lazerscraper> TLOU2 BEST SPORTS GAME
[0:51:12] <%T_Sasquatch> How many chilli places could there be near a magfest
[0:51:15] <%jillpilled> Ben's chili bowl, bet
[0:51:16] <+Dew217> OH it's the one guy who shit himself live on stage at the Game Awards standing next to Geoff kElleygh
[0:51:19] <+Anime_Flux> HEY
[0:51:21] <thefunkiestpunkiest> @MyNameIsRasus Yeah dude. You make your disdain for TLOU2 known by letting out a wicked shart.
[0:51:27] <+Anime_Flux> Chili's is... fine....
[0:51:27] <This_side_up_153> lol accurate
[0:51:29] <coreyyotto> TLOU2 did technically have golf in it
[0:51:29] <%SaiyanShoto> A shitty applebees

[0:51:31] <%bob900000> haha Canadian
[0:51:31] <%king_wragles> Never has Paige been more accurate.
[0:51:31] <thelonechris> Chili's is amazing
[0:51:35] <%walternatorz> didn't chili's go out of business? or was that chichis?
[0:51:35] <thefunkiestpunkiest> @ExpressNode Yes, thank you! Someone understands me.
[0:51:35] <RyuuAoi> Then wé will tell us

[0:51:40] <sydowoodo> applebees is shit
[0:51:43] <filialpails> everyone will go there and fart
[0:51:45] <+NWR_James> Chili's > Friday's by a significant margin
[0:51:45] <Zeif00> Does Canada have an equivilent restaurant?
[0:51:47] <This_side_up_153> when can we get an eating stream?
[0:51:47] <joso_grando> pats smelly balls
[0:51:49] <$Quack_of_Dawn> Chili's, Applebees, and Friday's are practically the same restaurant as far as I know

[0:52:33] <MarylandJutsu> paige its always in outer space
[0:52:35] <AlexDaGr8> baby's first christmas is nothing compared to baby's first sonic high school reading

[0:52:54] <ExpressNode> So what you always do Pat?
[0:52:57] <MarylandJutsu> we are always proud of elmo

[1:36:45] <%cafefunk> how come only the elmo pic?
[1:36:46] <@SoFarFetched> Yeah cause everyone is asking if it's the "N word"
[1:36:47] <This_side_up_153> Son of a Gamer
[1:36:48] <+Sendrak70> I think Pat secretly wrote it.
[1:36:49] <%Pandora_Prime> All slurs are gamer words
[1:36:51] <BlkFlameKami> GAMER WORD
[1:36:51] <$happyface699> Coward
[1:36:54] <miguel2k300> And Louis Vuitton the backpack, the combi flack lack
[1:36:57] <rilou501> I, as a Sonic fan, feel dirty, and I am sorry
[1:36:58] <LoliKappa> that is our word but you can say gama
[1:36:59] <alrobot2014> he was a gamer boy she said see ya later boy
[1:36:59] <$rdark_ksu> slur is honestly hilarious in its own right
[1:36:59] <%Madovir> it's funnier if it's "the gamer word"
[1:37:00] <%Promessa_EX> if it is the gamer word, say gamer word
[1:37:02] <%Ranryu692> like a person, but darker
[1:37:03] <%Jack_of_No_Trades> they are both hilarious replacement
[1:37:03] <+parzano> well let's get BACK to the stories

[1:37:22] <+LadySaga_> I used to read Sonic fanfics for real when I was a teenager
[1:37:22] <@SoFarFetched> but the problem with saying gamer it makes the word a lot worse.
[1:37:23] <bettysharkface> What about vtuber Paige muppet?
[1:37:25] <%Kenzo2000> As a sonic fan, how have you not felt dirty yet?

[2:21:35] <%GabeSweetMan> What do you mean? It just says gamer.
[2:21:35] <+d_dynamite88> Some oddly specific analogies in this
[2:21:36] <gamingspacesloth> GAMER IS A BAD WORD CHAT
[2:21:37] <+Wizardism> what chapter we on?

[2:21:41] <%T_Sasquatch> Surely gay isn't a slur
[2:21:41] <Sanyle> I wanna know why there was a slur there in the first place

[2:21:42] <$rdark_ksu> we are listening to sonic high school. Smart doesn't really apply here

[2:21:43] <+RealThiele> you talked alot with accents?
[2:21:44] <%PinkertonDanPie> Are we human or are we Gamer?
[2:21:44] <%Nitsorinni> Its because of all the evil Paige

[2:21:49] <+gustavozxd> actually that one was the f word
[2:21:50] <fuchard1996> please replace every censored word with GAMER
[2:21:50] <CursedNobleman> SMOrc WAAAAAAUUUUUGH
[2:21:50] <heart_ablaze> what makes you think we're smart,

[2:42:49] <%SuperCasualBoom> Cheer400 Hi, Paige. So If you remember I said a lot of things where things was going great and such months ago. In reality, I had to stop because of the sudden deaths of several friends due to sickness, car accidents, etc. The latest was this morning with the passing of the family dog, Lola. I been dealing with it via shopping, listening to music, and watching streams. Tonight, I been jumping to random streams to help cope with. Thank you and Pat for being some of the many I continuously watch.
