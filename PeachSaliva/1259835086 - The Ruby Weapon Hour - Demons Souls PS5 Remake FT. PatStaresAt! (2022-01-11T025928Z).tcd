[0:16:55] <+cvp5127> LUL

[0:16:57] <+Order_of_Mystery> "Normie Shit"
[0:16:58] <$KeiganOfAstora> Someone commented
[0:16:59] <%Ranryu692> Harry Potter is pretty bad
[0:17:00] <%AncelDeLambert> because Reggie agrees and is an educated and handsome man
[0:17:01] <+Mr_Pylon> He said it was Normie Shit
[0:17:01] <+Order_of_Mystery> Reggie the Chad
[0:17:02] <@commanderclaw> Harry Potter is a fucking children's series, don't make it part of your identity
[0:17:03] <calaska140> "adults"

[0:17:38] <CaptainKarite> A fan and a fanatic
[0:17:39] <%AncelDeLambert> fans are fine, Stans get the wall
[0:17:43] <%ssjklyco> I find people who work at Disneyland and go to Disneyland on their day's off for fun to be the worst
[0:17:44] <$Breakfast_Megapowers> Video game adults are even worse though, they play EA games
[0:17:44] <%Teintstein> stan have alerts on so they can dogpile strangers based on their comments
[0:17:49] <+KingKrampus> oh hey Kermit Pat
[0:17:49] <%ShootThatZombie> he's right
[0:17:51] <+ultimafullmetal> "something" adults can be pretty vague
[0:17:53] <luftraumm1> you gotta differentiate the categories

[0:18:05] <+ThomasOfTroy> Hey, some of us stan blowholes Pat and Paige
[0:18:06] <%Ranryu692> Paige is wrong, there are totally Sports Adults that are as bad as the Disney and Harry Potter adults. They're called Russell Westbrook stans

[0:19:59] <%g0atmeal> going to disney world six times in your life is a lot
[0:19:59] <%devanmuse> If you live next to it? maybe
[0:19:59] <+cvp5127> @PeachSaliva were they named after a disney character
[0:19:59] <@commanderclaw> WHAT

[0:20:00] <$Breakfast_Megapowers> only if you live like an hour away I guess

[0:20:02] <afronooch> if you live by it sure, but outta state hell nah
[0:20:02] <Tracazoid> Haven't been once, six times a year is impressive
[0:20:03] <%Sotetsu> My cousin really loves Disney, but he keeps it to himself.
[0:20:05] <KeiPrime> thats what the annual pass is for
[0:20:07] <+zamatermort> It is *if you live in the city*
[0:20:08] <%ssjklyco> I agree with Paige on this. I don't understand Disney people.
[0:20:09] <RhysClark97> i have literally never been to disneyworld
[0:20:11] <F_manS> woah, i've only been there twice in my life, and only when I was a kid!

[0:20:14] <%W1nterTitan> Overrated
[0:20:15] <+cubanjesus22> 6 times a year is normal if you have an annual pass. And LIVE in Califortnia
[0:20:16] <%NeonLight> I have family that live close, got passes, and would go for like a couple hours or so
[0:20:16] <@commanderclaw> I went to Disney World the once when I was fucking 10 man
[0:20:20] <+KingKrampus> once again Disney Adults are the Disney versions of Star Trek Trekkies who learn Klingon by heart
[0:20:22] <+RD_NX> Hey all you disney-dads and Minnie-moms out there, ready to meet mickey and gaston?
[0:20:22] <xmetalicdemon> They have to go 6 times a year because 90 percent of the time your in a line.
[0:20:22] <hotskull123> disney adults were theatre kids in high school
[0:20:24] <%Sotetsu> I love Tokyo Disney.
[0:20:24] <+whyskeywolfe> Yeah, Jenny Nicholson is kinda crazy.
[0:20:26] <+PrimalDweeb> Damn

[0:20:28] <CaptainKarite> I went in '06 and again in '13 and then I realized I hated it
[0:20:29] <%Ranryu692> I've never understood the desire to go to the Disney parks
[0:20:30] <%CubicPhantom> I call these people Disney supplicants.
[0:20:31] <Ethel9727> If you live a 45 minute drive from Disney World you're probably loaded anyway
[0:20:32] <%AncelDeLambert> THE PARK AINT THAT GREAT!
[0:20:34] <EynoStiles> @peachsaliva You seen the interview with the grown adults crying, because they open disney after they closed for the panademic.

[0:22:58] <%Bt_Robot> What's up with women and murder stories?
[0:22:59] <@commanderclaw> The True Crime ladies are just the female version of that dude who knows way too much about WW2

[0:23:01] <%Idziman> PatSuxAt

[0:23:08] <GravyLangley> i guess my vagina is broken because I just don't get the true crime thing
[0:23:10] <Neo_Kaiser> The Dick Show is a True Crime.
[0:23:16] <Mojomoud> So what you're saying is that to be a good friend and ally, I need to be an accomplice to crimes?

[0:23:52] <+KingKrampus> @g0atmeal I don't think growing out of your fandom is necessarily good either, it's whether you are an obnoxious ass about your fandom or not
[0:23:53] <+patriotrenegade> that makes a good stream
[0:24:03] <ExpressNode> I am low energy too after 10 days of work. Fuck I'm tired even on my day off
[0:24:04] <@PlagueOfGripes> should have played bad ben
[0:24:09] <+PrimalDweeb> But not the cheese, right?
[0:24:09] <%ssjklyco> Disney Adults love mouth noises
[0:24:17] <justcallmebobplease> I can't think of a time Paige DIDN'T give the proviso 'I'm very tired' at the start of a stream.

[0:25:55] <+bluedude153> What is pat becoming woolie about spoilers now!!
[0:25:56] <%Arkfyre> Don't get too attached to this character tee hee heee
[0:25:59] <$cooldude69xx> Spoiler adults can go
[0:25:59] <%g0atmeal> the worst is getting "helpful" news notifications on your phone, that are just manga spoilers in headlines
[0:25:59] <mr_saturday93> sleep forever! oh you meant groggy
[0:26:01] <justcallmebobplease> MAY SPOILER PEOPLE HAVE A BAD'S NIGHT SLEEP

[0:26:18] <bob900000> aaaaahhhhhhh!!
[0:26:18] <Laecerelius> It's like looking at a friend and smiling when something important is gonna happen in a show you like
[0:26:19] <@PlagueOfGripes> I know at least one person who is so proud of knowing a spoiler they'll spend tons of energy in TRYING to spoil something without overtly saying it, thereby spoiling it totally
[0:26:20] <AoiRob> its like "are you SURE you dont wanna straigh tyell spoilers???"
[0:26:22] <%ssjklyco> Spoilers belong on their shitty cars
[0:26:22] <$Puhff> Keepo
[0:26:23] <MyNameIsRasus> That ProZD skit rules

[0:26:32] <TacoSaIad> This is all to say that fans are actually the worst people.
[0:26:32] <%JobbedBone> or when you ask a specific question and they say "I don't want to spoil anything."

[0:27:11] <Dementedpenguin> "I didn't actually say the thing, it's not a spoil Kappa "
[0:27:19] <%Ranryu692> @marvel877 better vague "something important is about to happen" than an outright spoiler

[0:27:24] <IvanMistwalker> Sigma Grindset Friends
[0:27:24] <$Breakfast_Megapowers> did you take their K/D as punishment?
[0:27:26] <%AncelDeLambert> Paige wanted to Family Guy Care Bear herself
[0:27:26] <%g0atmeal> even if you didn't catch on, doesn't that just ruin the shock factor when it happens?
[0:27:27] <+WutangchickeN> I've been that guy and I HATE that I've been that guy
[0:27:28] <Profmcstevie> Puppy Dog Spoilers fucking suck, too much enthusiasm
[0:27:32] <$Puhff> Snape Kills Dumbledore will never not be funny tho
[0:27:33] <SovPho> My roommate is really good at deflecting spoilers. He'll act really suspicious about shit that you guess about a show and do all that but then you'll see that you were FUCKING WRONG and he let you believe you were right.

[0:27:44] <Neo_Kaiser> That's Undertale Adults for ya.
[0:27:49] <Dragon_Batman> Answering the hypothetical yea that sucks
[0:27:55] <AoiRob> when someone goes "hey the ending sucks"
[0:27:59] <+Ne1son> Hypotheticals do not exist on the internet
[0:28:03] <Profmcstevie> Man can't talk out loud on a stream about talking
[0:28:03] <MyNameIsRasus> HOW DID YOU KNOW DUSK TURNS INTO A TREE
[0:28:08] <TerpanderLux> good :)
[0:28:13] <Mojomoud> This is why when someone asks me about spoiler related things I've experienced that they haven't, I just go "No. Also, Keep Going" Even when they guess the spoiler I lie to them about being wrong because I want them to experience it.
[0:28:28] <TerpanderLux> DONT SEE IT!
[0:28:32] <+generalve> OH OH PAT "FGC ADULTS"
[0:28:33] <DXLelouch24> ban them out of spite @PeachSaliva

[0:28:53] <MyNameIsRasus> Greg would be able to unsee it

[0:28:54] <$RealThiele> no shit on spoiler adults
[0:28:56] <$Puhff> can I have MM?
[0:28:57] <scrumbotime> Pat eats the whole bag at once
[0:28:58] <$RealThiele> its ok
[0:28:58] <$Breakfast_Megapowers> Wouldn't it be crazy if *character* turned evil halfway through and killed the best friend?
[0:29:01] <+generalve> "pat make sure you DONT pay attention to that character"
[0:29:05] <Mojomoud> But then again, I donl;t give a fuck about spoilers so I have no horse in this race.

[0:29:18] <$RealThiele> dont get too attached to that oled jedi dude lmao
[0:29:18] <%CubicPhantom> there's a spectrum for these things, and hard big spoilers for major things deserves the hammer
[0:29:21] <DXLelouch24> ban them and then tell all the top streamers they watch so they ban them too @PeachSaliva
[0:29:21] <%g0atmeal> i wish i took woolie's advice and read the manga because people online got too excited about stone ocean and spoiled it for me
[0:29:22] <+patriotrenegade> I just spoil something for them
[0:29:23] <ExpressNode> I usually am not upset by spoiler and I don't spoiler others but I dont really get the hate behind it.
[0:29:25] <DXLelouch24> ULTIMATE REVENGE
[0:29:39] <marvel877> dude, i got spoiled on omori the in the podcast chat. i no longer feel like playing it.
[0:29:42] <$Breakfast_Megapowers> did you die?
[0:29:44] <EynoStiles> I prefer when @patstaresat spoiled woolie on something. and woolie got upset, but pat was like "no! Its fine! It sucks!"
[0:29:48] <ergulor> if it was out for a year is her fault
[0:29:49] <+rheviel> "Man I sure hope X dies they're such a good villain" "hehehe you won't be waiting long"
[0:29:54] <+patriotrenegade> was it Woolie
[0:29:57] <bob900000> what movie was it?
[0:30:02] <Louie_Salmon> I have used my mind palace to immunize myself from all spoilers, and pity you all

[0:30:26] <%Dirty_Dandere> Or if it's like 50 YEARS OLD
[0:30:29] <%g0atmeal> you're mercy-spoiling them
[0:30:29] <ExpressNode> It wasn't a good game anyway

[0:30:34] <justcallmebobplease> He spoiled Medium too though, didn't he?  On Podcast?
[0:30:34] <+Arek_1> I spoiled my friend by accident. I then just bullshitted and said that said character that died was just a side character they introduced for the episode. LUL
[0:30:34] <%AncelDeLambert> "I spoil PURPOSELY! Listen, ye fools!"
[0:30:35] <+Ne1son> Still a spoiler though

[0:30:41] <+WutangchickeN> isn't it fun so spoil shit that sucks tho?  like the ending of GoT???
[0:30:42] <CatRidder> the medium is garbage
[0:30:44] <Dragon_Batman> I think starting with it fucking sucks helps
[0:30:44] <justcallmebobplease> Justifiably spoiled, sure, but still.
[0:30:45] <mr_saturday93> When the twist is Garbo I think spoilers is ok
[0:30:45] <+Gouf_Troop> thats still opinions
[0:30:46] <%ItalianWaifu> ItalianWaifu subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 10 months! omg I made to the start for once. go do a souls Paige. Hi Pat to iguess
[0:30:48] <MyNameIsRasus> Final Fantasy XV too
[0:30:49] <Profmcstevie> The person who spoiled Omori thought they were probably saving you time, Hate Spoiling is your shit not others
[0:30:51] <DXLelouch24> then that person is FACTUALLY WRONG
[0:30:52] <TerpanderLux> its not good to lie :)
[0:30:52] <bob900000> LUL
[0:30:52] <%Agami23> woolie just wanted to give a spoiler warning
[0:30:52] <$DarkNerdShawny> Didnt little hope get good steam reviews?
[0:30:57] <huskarl_zap> play YIIK
[0:30:57] <$Dumple_Roe> Who gives a shit about Little hope fans
[0:30:57] <ExpressNode> Yeah but that movie is 40+ years old that doesn't count
[0:30:58] <+CapnBeefs> Little Hope was hot trash
[0:31:00] <$RealThiele> it was all a fart gas dream
[0:31:01] <oda_flobunaga> Exactly, I want to know if something is going to shit the bed before hand
[0:31:02] <XoftheTITANS> like The Last Of Us 2, that sux
[0:31:03] <theshillman> true
[0:31:03] <Louie_Salmon> @justcallmebobplease He did, but it became very quickly clear why
[0:31:04] <%AncelDeLambert> no, I know you two like utter trash
[0:31:06] <NoHoldsBarredProductions> If something's been out for a year I feel like there's a statute of limitations on that. Sucks if they've just gotten into the thing but a year's a year.
[0:31:11] <+Mr_Pylon> Little Hope and 12 Minutes are good to spoil to save people
[0:31:13] <+Mr_Pylon> Little Hope and 12 Minutes are good to spoil to save them
[0:31:13] <$Breakfast_Megapowers> what if I wanted to hate Little Hope on my own like a big boy
[0:31:14] <%g0atmeal> FORTY?
[0:31:14] <+Gouf_Troop> in your opinion
[0:31:15] <DXLelouch24> your opinion is WRONG then
[0:31:20] <mr_saturday93> There was NO TENSION in little hope.
[0:31:21] <+Mr_Pylon> Oops
[0:31:21] <+WutangchickeN> I could get a blowie for $40.  thanks Pat
[0:31:22] <+SaltySeaSam> thank you, big brother pat. for telling me what I can like
[0:31:22] <DXLelouch24> its a bad game
[0:31:24] <TerpanderLux> you love poop
[0:31:24] <+ThomasOfTroy> Nah, it's still a spoiler and shit to do
[0:31:25] <%AncelDeLambert> the two of you enjoy garbage with the active knowledge that what you are enjoying is garbage
[0:31:27] <EynoStiles> I wish someone spoiled me on Cats the muscial, so i didnt have to watch it.
[0:31:29] <MyNameIsRasus> Paige is into scat confirmed
[0:31:30] <T_Sasquatch> Clipped
[0:31:30] <ExpressNode> Wait did I get the wrong movie?
[0:31:32] <whimwhisp> You are a raccoon yes.
[0:31:34] <AoiRob> hi pat
[0:31:37] <$RealThiele> thats a low bar too
[0:31:38] <Sigma_190_Beta> Paige is into Scat?
[0:31:38] <justcallmebobplease> @Louie_Salmon Oh yeah for sure, it was an incredibly justified spoiler given he knew Woolie's taste, and the general taste of the fans - that was a correct choice to warn everyone off.
[0:31:38] <GravyLangley> Paige loves garbage because she is the trash queen
[0:31:39] <@PlagueOfGripes> your tastes are fucking awful, yes
[0:31:39] <+Gouf_Troop> it was
[0:31:42] <$KeiganOfAstora> Not literally garbage?
[0:31:42] <Dapper_Cactuar> you like stuff that's the enjoyable kind of bad, not the BAD kind of bad
[0:31:43] <Mojomoud> I think in the case of the Darth Vader thing, that's an instance of it being so ingrained in Pop Culture Osmosis at this point, that you've had it spoiled for you by the time you get to it
[0:31:45] <+SaltySeaSam> sorry, what i DO like. shit, my sarcasm isn't coming through
[0:31:47] <Sigma_190_Beta> Sorry I just tuned back into this.
[0:31:51] <$Breakfast_Megapowers> Little Hope has Little Hope for a sequel
[0:31:51] <+swesterly> i spent literal years getting a friend into game of thrones only to have someone spoil the major end of season 3 event mere minutes before he intended to start the episode
[0:31:55] <+KingKrampus> this reminds me of the time I was thinking of buying Shyamalan's Lady in the Water in Walmart, and a random couple approached me to warn me away from that movie, because they didn't want me to waste my money on it

[0:48:09] <+HefestoForges> it's not an Umbrella mistake
[0:48:10] <+MidnightBurst12> first time hearing about this
[0:48:11] <Dragon_Batman> Misreading in lab notes?
[0:48:13] <marvel877> So how long before the lockdowns in the US happen again?
[0:48:15] <Admiral_PopnFresh> FUSION HURGH X_X
[0:48:21] <SovPho> That's just not how this would work anyways. Viruses don't want to kill their hosts, so anything that's going to overtake Omicron will PROBABLY be much "weaker" and even more contagious.
[0:48:25] <+swesterly> that is not confirmed
[0:48:29] <robosqueeb> wow good thing they're not fucking PROFESSIONALS
[0:48:29] <+polothegreatest> We have fluorite now or something?

[0:48:48] <+MidnightBurst12> probably never, unfortunately
[0:48:50] <+Ches_Neckbeard> american will literally never lockdown
[0:48:51] <%skrewarrior> the us is never locking down we're fucked
[0:48:51] <%ssjklyco> we're back to more work from home
[0:48:56] <+swesterly> lockdowns will never happen in the US again, they would literally rather we all die
[0:48:56] <justcallmebobplease> Yeah we're dumb.
[0:48:57] <%W1nterTitan> Yeah, for real
[0:48:58] <F_manS> Never lock down again, think of the economy.
[0:48:58] <+ReallyBigRocks> lol like we had one to begin with
[0:49:01] <oda_flobunaga> America, Fuck Yeah...
[0:49:01] <EynoStiles> never US was done with lockdown after the first 8 months lol
[0:49:01] <+MidnightBurst12> we're gonna die lol
[0:49:03] <+cvp5127> haha we're doomed
[0:49:05] <%Breakfast_Megapowers> We should just stay locked down forever so I can bake bread
[0:49:06] <+RandyFistburgers> Im back to online uni. again
[0:49:07] <%Bt_Robot> There are entire states run by Covid deniers, probably gonna be a while
[0:49:07] <%g0atmeal> people here would literally go out more in response to a lockdown
[0:49:09] <Dapper_Cactuar> that would require leadership in the US not being stupid
[0:49:10] <+blastazoid00> I want lockdown again.  I miss work from home
[0:49:16] <ohno778> What type of vore tho?
[0:49:18] <%Ranryu692> a guy came into my store today wearing his mask on his forehead
[0:49:18] <+Ne1son> What about Cock vore
[0:49:19] <linSP> 700,000 new infected a day here in the US
[0:49:19] <churropoppa> @PeachSaliva We're never getting lock down again. The CDC was basically like "get fucked"
[0:49:20] <+Logoth_> ????
[0:49:20] <luftraumm1> oh yeah so ironic
[0:49:20] <+Order_of_Mystery> vore is a tough pill to swallow
[0:49:22] <%Agami23> america has too many cowards to go into lockdowns again
[0:49:23] <%AncelDeLambert> that might be a typo and he meant skeletons
[0:49:23] <+KngJester> we in the us would rather die than lock die again. we didnt even lock down the first time

[1:25:34] <Dragon_Batman> Elmo will probably just go for the hair
[1:25:50] <Makr0ss> the surround sound is amazing
[1:25:53] <DXLelouch24> Paiges arousal overwrites her instincts and thus the skeleton kills her
[1:25:53] <+セビー> Elmo has the right of first refusal, then gief may feast

[1:33:55] <AncyentMarinere> Remake added limits
[1:33:57] <%holydeviant1> Doesn;t that look familiar!
[1:33:58] <AyotoCorp> There's limits on how much grass you can carry of each type AND how much you can have in stock

[1:36:06] <NireFuster> So wait how did this work again? IS 4 the archstone number or is 1?
[1:36:16] <Bottulism> Remember when Paige was good at games? Like, never?

[1:36:47] <BigFingerRo> stop trying to facefuck him paige, rolling and defending is also a thing
[1:36:47] <%SMuffinMan> 4-1 is world 4, stage 1 for example
[1:36:48] <$mckraven> @nirefuster think of it like mario rules. 4-1 means level 4 zone 1
[1:36:51] <%Bane_Kaikyo> Batman never eats out
[1:36:57] <%SMuffinMan> @mckraven ye
[1:36:59] <NireFuster> Did she do the other ones already?!

[1:37:38] <+Fefe41> no
[1:37:41] <%SMuffinMan> @toptieramisu nope
[1:37:44] <+TopTieramisu> cool
[1:37:55] <NireFuster> Okay that makes sense, I thought Paige was speedrunning this thing but she just went straight to the 4th
[1:38:07] <%SMuffinMan> Ye
[1:38:08] <Dragon_Batman> Main goal is the fabled weapon of the zone really. And to maybe get the rocks of to the skellys
[1:38:13] <+TopTieramisu> the beauty of this game. you can go anywhere you want... after 1-1
[1:38:16] <BigFingerRo> YESSSSSS
[1:38:18] <Gabbycat> LUL
[1:38:25] <MyNameIsRasus> i also want titties on my life

[1:38:39] <%Bt_Robot> Somehow rolled INTO the arrows
[1:38:44] <+rheviel> @mynameisrasus same
[1:38:54] <+TopTieramisu> i see paige understands the power of fist on bone
[1:39:00] <+PrimalDweeb> Hey Paige, how are McDonald's fries up there? They've been kinda shit lately down where I'm at.
[1:39:03] <BigFingerRo> never heal
[1:39:05] <MyNameIsRasus> paige the bonefister
[1:39:09] <+mrcake_dragonman> Paige is kinda badass for playing with NO weapons
[1:39:10] <BigFingerRo> just run headfirst into danger
[1:39:17] <theknight123_> Try shield
[1:39:21] <$mckraven> Quick what's the best Disney song
[1:39:26] <+TopTieramisu> no cap, fist is decent against skeletons
[1:39:28] <%SMuffinMan> Do I hear Disney adulting? Kappa
[1:39:32] <NireFuster> Oh so Demon's just has fire magic huh? No Pyromancy?
[1:39:41] <+PrimalDweeb> LUL
[1:39:46] <+TopTieramisu> it's all just soul arts
[1:39:51] <MyNameIsRasus> shit titties are not as appetizing however
[1:39:52] <+ArmoredDeath> uawheeHuh
[1:39:52] <theknight123_> use shield
[1:39:54] <BigFingerRo> YESSSSSSS
[1:39:59] <Mattais88> roll race!

[1:40:07] <grimeything> This first little bit always takes time
[1:40:07] <%JoshManVGH> Hellfire pretty great
[1:40:11] <%CubicPhantom> the journey to become Fire Lord will take a little longer yet
[1:40:11] <MyNameIsRasus> she has replaced big sword spam with big spell spam
[1:40:13] <+TopTieramisu> pyromancy is something they introduced as a separate thing in dark souls. like humanity
[1:40:14] <%Bt_Robot> Maybe shield time
[1:40:46] <%g0atmeal> prometheus
[1:40:46] <$mckraven> its supposed to be their way to balance it.
[1:40:48] <+Bupkis7> enbPraise
[1:40:55] <%JoshManVGH> They are using the players power against them!
[1:40:55] <%SMuffinMan> @cubicphantom My favorite thing to do is become Old Monk and cast Firestorm as they come through the door. Hilarious easy souls lmao.
[1:40:57] <NireFuster> Did she just punch a skeleton to death?
[1:41:22] <$Dutchpotato> If only there was some way to block there  attacks….. if only
[1:41:29] <%JoshManVGH> That archer is a fuck
[1:41:31] <NireFuster> Awesome
[1:41:34] <$mckraven> @nirefuster blunt damage is good on bone and what's more blunt than a strong ladies fist
[1:41:41] <+Fefe41> Fist the boner men
[1:41:41] <%g0atmeal> again...
[1:41:42] <MyNameIsRasus> SHE FELL FOR IT AGAIN
[1:41:42] <NireFuster> Can't argue with that
[1:41:43] <HeroSolaire> Did Pat make Paige go this class for the easy mode?
[1:41:48] <NireFuster> I was wondering why she didn't have a sword
[1:41:50] <BigFingerRo> GET LEARNED
[1:41:51] <MyNameIsRasus> THUNDER CROSS HURRICANE SKELETON!!
[1:41:51] <Makr0ss> yeah, block the rolling and eat shit
[1:41:52] <jackalias> You can shoot them, then walk up
[1:41:52] <+moranprime> Those darn spooky scary skeletons
[1:41:54] <%SMuffinMan> @herosolaire ye
[1:41:55] <NireFuster> But then again enemies do have different defenses and such
[1:41:58] <%Agami23> its weird how demons souls and bloodborne at the only ones where enemies have really specific weaknesses like blunt for skeletons
[1:42:02] <%SophiaAmoreaVeritas> Punches are stronger.
[1:42:03] <+rheviel> every time? every time.
[1:42:09] <%abelincoln_catpuncher> Paige you don't have to get all up in their guys every time

[1:50:57] <+セビー> I don’t think heimlich is like.. not taught.. it’s just that it busts ribs real easy
[1:51:02] <+セビー> idk what the alternative is
[1:51:17] <luftraumm1> tbf I would be scared to do a choking maneuver on paige and crack her spine
[1:51:25] <Makr0ss> she probably choked on a crumb
[1:51:31] <+axenred> i just realized peaches theme is sonic
[1:51:34] <DusK_The_Stray> Would Paige shatter like glass?
[1:51:34] <%Bane_Kaikyo> @セビー if it busts ribs then the one doing it is doing it terribly wrong
[1:51:36] <+rheviel> Paige would break
[1:51:44] <DanThePumpkinman> PatStaresAt PeachSalivas funeral
[1:51:48] <+Fefe41> CPR can break bones too if done poorly
[1:51:51] <ttc_lover> I can’t believe Paige is having two near death experiences in one stream
[1:51:58] <+PrimalDweeb> Pat would be lost without Paige
[1:52:06] <+セビー> @bane_kaikyo probably, ppl don’t exactly have ample opportunity to ‘get it right’ tho
[1:52:07] <CunnymobileBrakeFluid> are talking about the sex
[1:52:08] <Dragon_Batman> Can you breathe?
[1:52:08] <%Bane_Kaikyo> WHAT?!?
[1:52:12] <%cobalt_phoenix_> ye
[1:52:12] <%holydeviant1> She just came back to correct them
[1:52:13] <+colouroftheiris77> It's supposed to crack ribs, unfortunately
[1:52:15] <+MisterAvry> yeah you can repair ribs, not drowned lungs
[1:52:15] <tanarath> Uh, no?
[1:52:15] <+PrimalDweeb> So he wouldn't let her die.
[1:52:18] <NireFuster> Did you crack a small child's ribs?!
[1:52:20] <+Arek_1> First do back slaps. Failing that, do the Heimlich maneuver.
[1:52:21] <QueequegTheater> @PeachSaliva No, that's CPR, not the Heimlich
[1:52:21] <whittacre> if you're not cracking ribs you're not compressing
[1:52:23] <SovPho> That's for chest compressions, mostly, isn't it?
[1:52:23] <MyNameIsRasus> Paige the small child bone breaker
[1:52:23] <%cobalt_phoenix_> how else do you think you're gonna get the heart to pump guys
[1:52:23] <Sigma_190_Beta> @Bane_Kaikyo Yes, in very specific circumstances.
[1:52:24] <tanarath> I mean, maybe, but no?
[1:52:26] <+Logoth_> Paige back breakers a small child
[1:52:28] <studleydoorite> Paige would crack those ribs again, right now
[1:52:32] <$mckraven> yeah breaking ribs sucks but at least you don't die
[1:52:33] <marvel877> So... Pat?
[1:52:33] <Faustgesicht> A few busted ribs is better than death
[1:52:34] <SovPho> Not the same as the Heimlich
[1:52:35] <T_Sasquatch> Bruh
[1:52:35] <$rdark_ksu> Yup you dont pussy foot around trying to put life in people
[1:52:37] <+colouroftheiris77> Unsettling, but accurate
[1:52:38] <%cobalt_phoenix_> or lungs to get pumped
[1:52:39] <+kewlmyc> "I'm glad I crack the child's ribs." - PeachSaliva
[1:52:40] <@SoFarFetched> yeah its literally you HAVE to use force
[1:52:40] <studleydoorite> for no reason I meant
[1:52:40] <Pookiedaexzile> Paige cracked a childs ribs what
[1:52:41] <Cobaltor_252> you physically have to work their lungs and sometimes you have to go through ribs to do it
[1:52:41] <+WeLucklessJacks> So how many ribs of yours did Pat break?
[1:52:43] <tanarath> I mean, yeah!
[1:52:46] <HoboFlea> Paige broke a child's ribs, new lore
[1:52:48] <AncyentMarinere> In school they told us a few broken ribs is worth a life
[1:52:48] <SuperGoblinPunch> Break their bones fairly quickly
[1:52:49] <Adojim> cpr requires a 2in depression of the ribcage (on an adult) to be performed correctly
[1:52:49] <QueequegTheater> I've literally had the Heimlich done on me.  CPR requires rib breaking. Heimlich does not.
[1:52:51] <leinadtonu> That’s a very convenient excuse…
[1:52:52] <%JoshManVGH> DNR orders exist as an option to spare people from the suffering of CPR, cause that shit is ROUGH
[1:52:52] <%Bane_Kaikyo> Human's truely are fragile, fickle creatures
[1:52:53] <+TopTieramisu> is pat googling the heimlich maneuver?
[1:52:55] <tanarath> But only as a last resort!
[1:52:56] <%SMuffinMan> The ribs cover the lungs people, yes they have to take some damage
[1:52:58] <$TIME_PUNCHER> replace my lungs with gas bearings to save me from the dues of inhalation
[1:53:00] <%g0atmeal> i hope i get to break a child's ribs one day
[1:53:04] <SovPho> Turns out the ribcage is fucking strong and to get a heart pumping you have to do some serious damage.
[1:53:05] <BigFingerRo> Paige is saying she'd pee on any of us if we got stung by a jellyfish
[1:53:06] <+PrimalDweeb> I mean, you have to squish the water out.
[1:53:06] <Dragon_Batman> I don't remember hearing that
[1:53:09] <+ALazo> I can't believe you saved a child by crushing her ribs
[1:53:12] <%bettysharkface> A good way to tell where to push, is you put your hand in the armpit, and move it across the chest, that point in the middle is roughly the good spot to compress, and you need to put your whole body into it
[1:53:14] <sleepystardewfarmer> you're just... gonna drop a story like that??
[1:53:14] <marvel877> Big and strong Paige crushed a child's ribs.
[1:53:17] <Darkred28> monkaS
[1:53:18] <$Puppet88> I remember this story but I think it was from the Periscope days?
[1:53:19] <$mckraven> that child is now a teenager cause of you @peachsaliva
[1:53:22] <%g0atmeal> i don't blame you
[1:53:23] <Milosolaire> Yeah she's right. CPR certification was forced on me. They straight up tell you about the rib cracking.
[1:53:47] <cgreene64> The dummies click to simulate the rib cracking afaiu
[1:53:51] <tanarath> They NEVER said anything about rib-cracking
[1:53:54] <SovPho> Isn't breaking ribs more for pumping the heart?
[1:54:07] <SulfurousAcid> D:
[1:54:09] <parkslady> oh god lol
[1:54:11] <+Payatann> I’m sorry but Pat just had the most dear in the lights reaction I’ve ever seen
[1:54:13] <%Bane_Kaikyo> cheezus
[1:54:13] <sleepystardewfarmer> that's nuts... but I hope you're proud that you saved someone's life!
[1:54:14] <Gabbycat> LUL jesus
[1:54:20] <CunnymobileBrakeFluid> Paige is just talking about her time in 'Nam
[1:54:21] <CollinsOfBodom> break their bones fairly quickly
[1:54:21] <Adojim> its why a lot of cpr dummies click now when depressed correctly
[1:54:22] <ToneBacas> cool image
[1:54:26] <SulfurousAcid> I was NOT expecting that paige
[1:54:28] <NitroDavid> the CPR training is probably different in each country. In Aus teachers have mandatory CPR training they teach us 1/3 of their chest height in compression and you will almost always break ribs
[1:54:30] <+セビー> oh well.. now back to the loop of these 5 skeletons
[1:54:30] <$TIME_PUNCHER> as someone with a kid a similar age, i hate that sentence
[1:54:33] <MyNameIsRasus> ! BLEEDING !
[1:54:37] <+EmotionalFatGuy> Paige's cpr instruction video was just a montage of WWE
[1:54:50] <NireFuster> LUL Pat just stares at his wife choking to death
[1:54:54] <@commanderclaw> Time to order a CPR dummy and do at home training!
[1:54:55] <cs0402196> how comvenient for peaches to start dying when I'm taking out the trash
[1:54:56] <sleepystardewfarmer> Now I know that a baby's ribcage feels like lays chips
[1:54:58] <NireFuster> That was so funny
[1:55:00] <%bettysharkface> Tbh I think they should teach regular cpr throughout life, cause like, my dad had a heartattack and if they hadn't luckily had someone there that knew cpr he would have been dead for sure
[1:55:01] <+Logoth_> self heimerdinger
[1:55:01] <jowi_time> which basically self impale on the nearest chair
[1:55:02] <Oscarthemowerman> ! COUGH ! going down steadily
[1:55:13] <SovPho> Pat in timeout?
[1:55:14] <%Ranryu692> good thing you do, or Pat would be doing the self-heimlich himself if you know what I mean
[1:55:17] <%JoshManVGH> Wasn't the heimlich maneuver proven to be ineffective?
[1:55:18] <AoiRob> their strikes are so GIRTHY
[1:55:18] <Treasure_Vault> Maybe put the shield in your non-wand hand until you get a weapon buff spell?
[1:55:22] <MyNameIsRasus> @Logoth_ the Donger. The dongmeister general.
[1:55:25] <%SMuffinMan> Have you guys never taken Physiology? Yes ribs will crack if you want to co press heart or lungs. THEY SHIELD THOSE ORGANS. THEY HAVE TO CRACK.
[1:55:25] <CunnymobileBrakeFluid> does it feel like kettle cooked or regular lays?
[1:55:27] <Treasure_Vault> So you can block and cast?
[1:55:35] <+TopTieramisu> Jebasted
[1:55:42] <$rdark_ksu> I almost choked to death alone at work once. Dont take big bites just because you can kids.
[1:55:45] <MyNameIsRasus> paige requires more weed
[1:55:50] <NireFuster> Paige is running out of weed
[1:55:51] <BigFingerRo> AGAIN
[1:55:57] <@PlagueOfGripes> so how long is this no weapon run going to go on anyway
[1:56:00] <tanarath> o-oh
[1:56:00] <%g0atmeal> that's really scary tbh. but glad things worked out
[1:56:05] <sleepystardewfarmer> I have to assume a situation where a child is dying would be really messed up
[1:56:06] <+polothegreatest> pat will get a master after this
[1:56:07] <+Arek_1> Wait, for real? The top UI is just that small?
[1:56:10] <+セビー> until it’s done plague, until it’s done
[1:56:16] <tanarath> @plagueofgripes just for this area.
[1:56:25] <NireFuster> I think Pat mentioned that fists do more damage that's why
[1:56:25] <Treasure_Vault> I think heimlich is copywrited or something dumb
[1:56:30] <$RealThiele> your messing up CPR with backwards abdominal thrust
[1:56:35] <%Bt_Robot> No, Hiemlich was just a super bad guy.
[1:56:35] <NireFuster> Because Paige is just THAT strong
[1:56:49] <%ospreyworks> They've revised it and gone back and forth on the efficacy of breaths vs pure chest compressions, over the years
[1:56:55] <%bettysharkface> With choking, it's kind of easier just to wait for the person to pass out, cause then you can get into their mouth/throat without them panicking and clear the obstruction
[1:56:59] <%SMuffinMan> Funny thing the doctor that came up with the Heimlich got saved with it later in life, shit works.
[1:57:05] <@PlagueOfGripes> by the way this catalyst hand system sucks and still hasn't gone away
[1:57:20] <$TIME_PUNCHER> the worst part about being homeless in Chicago is I can't justify buying weed until I have a place to live first
[1:57:27] <%vivaciouseff> @Treasure_Vault iirc there was literally a Dr. Heimlich who did the night circuit tour and just told all of media that the Heimlich maneuver could save anyone and that's the only reason it has any staying power
[1:57:32] <+セビー> they kinda bypassed it with a shield catalyst in 2
[1:57:45] <NireFuster> This entire experience has created a new fear in Paige LUL the fact that Pat didn't know what to do
[1:57:51] <+TopTieramisu> LUL
[1:57:53] <QueequegTheater> LUL
[1:57:54] <%Breakfast_Megapowers> Gottem
[1:57:55] <+TopTieramisu> i knew it
[1:57:56] <BigFingerRo> Never heal
[1:58:00] <+ALazo> haha gottem
[1:58:00] <%holydeviant1> sipsipHellmo
[1:58:01] <+セビー> counterargument: chew your food
[1:58:05] <%skrewarrior> cheer500 I'm watching from the bathtub, stewing in my own juices
[1:58:08] <HeroSolaire> @PlagueOfGripes your net still sucky for ff7 stream Plague?
[1:58:10] <+grayshack> good morning all
[1:58:11] <@PlagueOfGripes> honestly her not healing at all is better for her learning experience right now
[1:58:13] <BigFingerRo> Paige never heals she's so big and strong
[1:58:13] <+grayshack> this game looks incred
[1:58:18] <+flipsilog> you should stop eating McDo @peachsaliva
[1:58:18] <DanThePumpkinman> making new fears all of the time
[1:58:28] <%g0atmeal> man those shield sound effects are great
[1:58:35] <AthenaAegis> @BigFingerRo The Anti-Wolverine Kappa
[1:58:41] <+Arek_1> Pat, the alternative is that now you have to chew Paige's food for her. LUL
[1:58:43] <+rheviel> I'm glad you didn't die Paige, you should only choke in games not life please
[1:58:46] <Cobaltor_252> this is going well
[1:58:50] <+TopTieramisu> the haptic feedback is really cool too
[1:58:57] <%holydeviant1> I love that GONG sound of the hard shield impact, that's good sound there
[1:58:59] <IronGlorfindel> @Arek_1 just baby bird it
[1:59:11] <+TopTieramisu> :(
[1:59:15] <%SMuffinMan> Oh the haptic feedback in this game rules
[1:59:19] <luftraumm1> psaPorgmo
[1:59:23] <$RealThiele> you diiiid
[1:59:35] <Adojim> especially since paige tries to die like once a day
[1:59:39] <Dragon_Batman> I can understand how you feel tho Pat
[1:59:47] <@PlagueOfGripes> yeah, maybe don't try killing yourself foremost before worrying about others saving you
[1:59:48] <%Ranryu692> Just remember to do chest compressions to the beat of that one Bee Gees song
[1:59:53] <%Ranryu692> "how deep is your love"
[1:59:55] <sleepystardewfarmer> when these things happen, it can be difficult to act
[1:59:55] <@SoFarFetched> SoFarFetched subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 30 months, currently on a 30 month streak! 30 months holy shit. Played my first Phasmophobia game with Jenna & PeachJars today. I'm proud to let you know that I lived at LEAST twice in the 6 or so games I played with them and made SOME dollary doos as a treat.
[1:59:56] <+TopTieramisu> life is a series of embarrassments
[1:59:57] <+PrimalDweeb> We're just giving you shit Pat, we don't mean anything by it.
[1:59:58] <NireFuster> I hope Pat isn't feeling legitimately bad :(
[2:00:00] <+Payatann> Don’t feel bad Pat it’s an honest moment to learn and thankfully didn’t lead to something worse
[2:00:02] <+polothegreatest> sofarfLurk
[2:00:06] <HeroSolaire> Doesnt the other magic spell do more damage?
[2:00:14] <BigFingerRo> THE PINCER MANEUVER AGAIN, WATCH
[2:00:24] <MyNameIsRasus> suck your COCK
[2:00:24] <HoboFlea> You should NOT perform the heimlich on someone capable of coughing. Only if the airway is actually blocked.
[2:00:26] <%g0atmeal> like master chief's suit
[2:00:29] <+セビー> I’d also want to know how Paige tried to signal pat, coz there was confusion there
[2:00:49] <stratrat13> does she remember parrying?
[2:00:51] <+Payatann> I know the maneuver and froze and my mom almost choked to death
[2:01:01] <+ALazo> lefa
[2:01:02] <DanThePumpkinman> I should go back and watch Peach play bloodborne. I don't think i finished those vods
[2:01:02] <%Breakfast_Megapowers> strong/big
[2:01:08] <%g0atmeal> @セビー she tweeted him
[2:01:19] <+swesterly> i can not believe paige has spent an hour on this opening stretch
[2:01:21] <%SMuffinMan> @danthepumpkinman They're pretty great
[2:01:25] <%JoshManVGH> @peachsaliva my mistake! Heimlichs name was taken off the maneuver because the creater ran a smear campagin against backblows. So you're absolutly right, it's NOT that they DON'T work, it's that they got renamed to "abdominal thrusts"
[2:01:27] <+axenred> melee caster build
[2:01:28] <+Arek_1> I wonder how many people don't freeze up on their first emergency.
[2:01:39] <leinadtonu> Isn’t it better to use your fingers to remove the blockage when somebody is coughing? No sure my self, tho.
[2:01:41] <@PlagueOfGripes> she can just do the skip now right
[2:01:43] <%Breakfast_Megapowers> why did you make out with the skeleton while casting fireball?
[2:01:54] <NireFuster> To be fair up until the BRB screen I wasn't sure if she was SERIOUSLY choking or if she was just kind of choking
[2:02:06] <%JoshManVGH> Looks like the red cross advises backblows, followed by abdominal thrusts to assist in choking.
[2:02:06] <%SMuffinMan> HEAL
[2:02:11] <%Ranryu692> left or right
[2:02:12] <BigFingerRo> no, kill the guy tho
[2:02:15] <heartlesshealer> You can do it Paige! You've got the power of beasts, a sick child's prayer, and sitting next to Pat
[2:02:15] <+ReallyBigRocks> grab thing
[2:02:18] <CappuccinoGuil> If you pick it up, you win
[2:02:23] <CappuccinoGuil> YOU'VE WON!

[2:03:05] <NireFuster> AND you almost died today!
[2:03:05] <%Ranryu692> nonono Paige, this game is all about unlocking easy mode
[2:03:06] <+Logoth_> doesnt make the game THAT easy
[2:03:06] <Makr0ss> and what about it
[2:03:06] <%Agami23> and she has extra brain damage from the lack of oxygen
[2:03:07] <$RealThiele> this game cheats so its fair
[2:03:17] <%ssjklyco> easy mode for Paige is still Medium for her
[2:03:18] <+twohitgood> it's fine. not saying otherwise. it's an impressively good weapon.
[2:03:19] <+EmotionalFatGuy> god dmg now
[2:03:21] <+tempestzephyr> Wait when did brain damage happen?
[2:03:25] <%cade_calrayn> *irish accent* I'm dis-abled
[2:03:33] <Dragon_Batman> At least she isn't going faith, that shit would be nuts if she went that route
[2:03:34] <+kewlmyc> Kreygasm
[2:03:40] <BigFingerRo> it's ok, guys, she's marrying him
[2:03:42] <+Arek_1> @cade_calrayn LUL

[2:04:10] <DianaTheAscian> It's very good
[2:04:16] <+セビー> @misteravry thing is, she gets hand held so much idk how much she internalizes
[2:04:16] <NireFuster> LUL
[2:04:19] <HeroSolaire> oh lol its ok
[2:04:19] <%SMuffinMan> LUL
[2:04:22] <tanarath> Does Paige remember how to Parry?
[2:04:22] <studleydoorite> she hates us :(

[2:04:23] <mr_saturday93> LUL
[2:04:24] <%g0atmeal> censorship
[2:04:24] <+twohitgood> isn't roll speed good up to 50% in DeS?
[2:04:28] <Dragon_Batman> lol I was wondering about that
[2:04:31] <Valdorick> Her finger gunned 'em down.
[2:04:33] <@Jekado> geefThink

[2:04:43] <@SoFarFetched> TAKE HER STREAMER PRIVILEGES AWAY
[2:04:53] <%Breakfast_Megapowers> wait was I supposed to be able to read HeroSolaire's text it was just grayed out for me
[2:04:55] <@SoFarFetched> CANT BE TRUSTED
[2:04:56] <@SoFarFetched> geefNo
[2:04:57] <NireFuster> She's going crazy with power!
[2:05:06] <BigFingerRo> I sure hope peaches doesn't die here again!
[2:05:07] <CunnymobileBrakeFluid> ghosts are spooky, it's their thing
[2:05:09] <+rheviel> No one is safe!
[2:05:11] <%g0atmeal> now HeroSolaire gets to play and Paige must stay in chat
[2:05:12] <Pookiedaexzile> Try both
[2:05:18] <%Breakfast_Megapowers> something reliable like Pats CPR
[2:05:26] <HeroSolaire> I do dislike what they did to King Allant visuals and voice in the remake
[2:05:29] <NireFuster> Nice dodges!!!
[2:05:30] <+ReallyBigRocks> :)
[2:05:35] <%JoshManVGH> Oh shit those are soul arrows literally?

[2:05:47] <cinnamosandalwo> this games sound design is so good 👌
[2:05:52] <CommanderCOOL> ayeee lets go paige!!!

[2:17:11] <buffaloaff> *Insert Zoidberg noises here*
[2:17:12] <DusK_The_Stray> That burst hurts
[2:17:13] <%Ranryu692> @SoFarFetched nice LUL
[2:17:24] <@commanderclaw> Oh god, I just realized something. With all the locked doors and the samey layout, this is a fucking Silent Hill level
[2:17:29] <Dragon_Batman> Yea you go, oooooh gooood!
[2:17:38] <+TopTieramisu> AGREED
[2:17:39] <SuperGoblinPunch> Agreed
[2:17:43] <DianaTheAscian> Really?
[2:17:44] <%Tenchi_G> Agreed
[2:17:45] <@PlagueOfGripes> eh.
[2:17:45] <%chvmpchange> YES TRUE
[2:17:47] <%g0atmeal> Nonsense, Frigid Outskirts is way better
[2:17:49] <AyotoCorp> 100%
[2:17:51] <TheAntiNihilist> No
[2:17:51] <Monkeyweed21> ehhh
[2:17:52] <toomanygnome> no
[2:17:52] <+calzonewithextracheese> no way
[2:17:52] <+RustyCoyoteA> I’m with you Pat
[2:17:52] <%Ranryu692> yeah this one is pretty cool
[2:17:53] <worldbrand> I think it's pretty good, but i dunno if i'd go that far
[2:17:54] <TehMud> Eh its good I'm not sure about best but its definitely up there
[2:17:54] <%cade_calrayn> This and the next one
[2:17:55] <@PlagueOfGripes> it's mainly just some very linear hallways
[2:17:55] <mr_saturday93> how so? never played so I don't know
[2:17:55] <+steak_meme> I dont disagree, but its a valid opinion
[2:17:55] <%Agami23> its the scariest it ever got
[2:17:56] <+MisterAvry> the atmosphere here is incredible
[2:17:57] <+moranprime> It's certainly no Lost Izalith lol
[2:17:57] <+Fadedblank247> yeah agree
[2:17:59] <Dragon_Batman> I dunno but it is at least one of em
[2:18:00] <HeroSolaire> Uh... why? The floors are confusing
[2:18:01] <+rheviel> it's coool
[2:18:03] <@PlagueOfGripes> aesthetically it's okay, but as a level it's kind of shitty
[2:18:06] <%Tenchi_G> That's singing still gets me
[2:18:12] <%doomunderthestairs> what is your favorite Plague?
[2:18:13] <Oscarthemowerman> Irithyll is the shit tho
[2:18:14] <Monkeyweed21> its good but its not exactly Anor Londo
[2:18:15] <+FOGSHIE> Plague preaches the truth
[2:18:16] <+MooseIsGoose> I really love this and and the 5th zone mainly for the story
[2:18:21] <toomanygnome> that's a weird way to pronounce "I have bad opinions"
[2:18:22] <Makr0ss> can't you just mash
[2:18:24] <+greasypete00> idk senpou temple is really cool
[2:18:26] <%SMuffinMan> Anor Londo for me
[2:18:28] <NireFuster> Pat do you mean the BEST DESIGNED area or just the coolest looking area?
[2:18:30] <+HelveticaScenario> This zone is an annoying maze. It's not fun at all.
[2:18:42] <DianaTheAscian> Undead burg is prob my fav
[2:18:46] <%g0atmeal> Fountainhead Palace, no contest
[2:18:50] <+TopTieramisu> the zone isn't just the prison though
[2:18:52] <+moranprime> This level is kind of like proto Duke's Archives
[2:19:03] <+MisterAvry> zorp
[2:19:07] <+zamatermort> LUL
[2:19:10] <+TopTieramisu> @moranprime duke's archives is poopoo though
[2:19:12] <%SMuffinMan> Proto Irithyll Dungeon
[2:19:14] <@PlagueOfGripes> he kiss but he never miss
[2:19:14] <%chvmpchange> Im pretty sure pat meanth the whole of latria and not just this one level
[2:19:15] <$RealThiele> Boo!
[2:19:21] <%JoshManVGH> It's the writhing that really sells the surprise
[2:19:23] <MrNoremac208> I get here and she immediately dies lol that's about right
[2:19:30] <+FOGSHIE> Every single level of Tower of Latria is just hallways except the swamp.
[2:19:31] <$RealThiele> grind leves
[2:19:32] <Monkeyweed21> hit up a pot club
[2:19:36] <+ChocolateMoofin> omg it's the care-er duo!
[2:19:36] <HeroSolaire> Best part of Latria is the removed Rydell's screams
[2:19:44] <+moranprime> @TopTieramisu I get bullied all the time by the spiky crystal guys lol
[2:19:45] <Dragon_Batman> That's the norm yea LUL
[2:19:46] <$WaitHowDidIGetHere> Paige farming for weed
[2:19:53] <HeroSolaire> or better, when they were still in the game I mean
[2:19:53] <%g0atmeal> I wonder if this is where Mitch Digger came from
[2:19:56] <+PrimalDweeb> Bluepoint did a really good job with this remake/remaster.
[2:19:57] <+vanareus> how long has game
[2:20:01] <@PlagueOfGripes> time to get angry at lizards
[2:20:02] <%Agami23> 1
[2:20:05] <+FOGSHIE> @vanareus very long
[2:20:14] <AyotoCorp> 1-2 is a good spot
[2:20:22] <gingerbonez> 1-1 Red Eyed Knight
[2:20:28] <MrNoremac208> who else here hit 90 before the first boss in EW?
[2:20:34] <%Bt_Robot> Pat, you gonna grind out weed in-between streams?
[2:20:37] <NireFuster> GET 'EM!
[2:20:39] <+MisterAvry> good spot
[2:20:42] <+TopTieramisu> @FOGSHIE the last part of latria 1 is not a hallway, unless your scale of what constitutes a hallway is out of wack
[2:20:43] <PocketBearIllustrator> I should be sleeping. :D
[2:20:43] <+ChocolateMoofin> We believe in you!
[2:20:52] <%g0atmeal> @MrNoremac208 hit 90 years old waiting for the queue you mean?
[2:20:52] <NireFuster> Oh!!
[2:20:57] <NireFuster> Ayyyy LUL got it

[2:21:01] <+MisterAvry> good job
[2:21:02] <+PrimalDweeb> You did it
[2:21:05] <%Agami23> i believe 1 is good for leaves, 2 is good for upgrade stones, i forget the rest
[2:21:08] <MrNoremac208> @g0atmeal yuuuuuuuuuuup
[2:21:09] <+ChocolateMoofin> Congrats!
[2:21:13] <NireFuster> Oh that's super BS
[2:21:14] <@PlagueOfGripes> that blind woman beat the shit out of that raccoon
[2:21:22] <HeroSolaire> They do respawn if you reload the area
[2:21:30] <+FOGSHIE> @FOGSHIE It's a bigger hallway
[2:21:44] <+ReallyBigRocks> yucky man

[2:24:04] <$FrostedZaibatsu> Really they changed the name
[2:24:05] <+greasypete00> because people memed the shit out of it

[2:24:17] <+ChocolateMoofin> @PlagueOfGripes That is where it goes, yes zachtu1NUTx
[2:24:27] <+tempestzephyr> Rub CUM on your sword to make it STRONGER
[2:24:30] <+FOGSHIE> the sound design in this game is so intense
[2:24:37] <NireFuster> BTW Paige if you're interested in magic you might wanna read what the sticky white stuff does!
[2:24:38] <DusK_The_Stray> I never saw "YOU DEFEATED" and it just killed me, lmao
[2:24:41] <HeroSolaire> They changed a demon skin from like charcoal dark to white, bluepoint plays it VERY SAFE

[2:25:45] <heartlesshealer> persistent changes are neat
[2:25:50] <+TopTieramisu> the redesigns in this game are lacking
[2:25:53] <@PlagueOfGripes> almost surprised they didn't patch out the total failure of their expressions
[2:25:54] <$WaitHowDidIGetHere> The Fat Controller's not looking too good.
[2:25:55] <+ChocolateMoofin> Nightmare Before Christmas Great Value Mayor

[2:26:37] <+Taisuru> The fat officials are officially fat
[2:26:38] <+vanareus> Blind chick takes it all from Fat Evil
[2:26:38] <CunnymobileBrakeFluid> @rekinom Trudeau camouflage confers a bonus to magic damage
[2:26:41] <+TopTieramisu> @Gabbycat you can google the redesign. they butchered her outfit
[2:26:42] <%Agami23> i remember now. 1 is good for grass, 2 is good for most upgrade materials, 3 is good for spice, 4 is good for bladestone upgrades, and 5 is good for lotus
[2:26:46] <@PlagueOfGripes> man, 5 won't last long
[2:26:48] <TurtlesAndTentacles> annnnnnnd it's over
[2:26:50] <Dragon_Batman> 5 is rife with shit
[2:26:51] <%g0atmeal> let's do the Giants one
[2:27:01] <HeroSolaire> Lets check out Zone 6 oh wait they didn't add in it
[2:27:01] <QueequegTheater> It became DS2
[2:27:02] <+TopTieramisu> @Gabbycat they even butchered the look of her weapon
[2:27:04] <Profmcstevie> No idea wasted in Fromsoft history
[2:27:15] <HeroSolaire> Oh no, the worst demon souls area
[2:27:21] <+tempestzephyr> pooooooo00p zone
[2:27:23] <NireFuster> Welcome to Blighttown
[2:27:23] <+PrimalDweeb> May the Orb official guide us!
[2:27:25] <+ReallyBigRocks> poo poo slug town
[2:27:25] <%g0atmeal> would you live in a swamp for your waifu?
[2:27:28] <Valdorick> Paige heard a woman was in that zone, it will now fully cleared.
[2:27:28] <+Fefe41> I love this area unironically
[2:27:34] <+tussletoes> valley of defilement slaps. sorry nerds
[2:27:35] <+rheviel> Plaguetown
[2:27:42] <Dragon_Batman> Really went southern on that Valley part LUL
[2:27:43] <+greasypete00> simp valley
[2:27:45] <+ChocolateMoofin> located in the crevace of depair, adjacent to the crack of unholiness
[2:27:52] <%cade_calrayn> Eli is at home here, Paige
[2:27:56] <HeroSolaire> I always just speedrun this area kinda boring to look at
[2:28:04] <%chvmpchange> this is the best swamp zone in a souls game
[2:28:07] <HeroSolaire> Didnt play the ps5 version tho
[2:28:16] <@PlagueOfGripes> this is where I shit in that lady's mouth
[2:28:23] <+tussletoes> this is easily the least grating swamp in souls imo
[2:28:26] <+ChocolateMoofin> That also means nothing is good here lmao
[2:28:44] <heartlesshealer> hole open
[2:28:54] <NireFuster> Does this remind you of anything you've seen before Paige?
[2:28:55] <NireFuster> Ayyyy
[2:28:58] <NireFuster> There it is LUL
[2:29:04] <NireFuster> Literally just Blighttown
[2:29:04] <scrumbotime> EVERY game has the Doo Doo Swamp
[2:29:06] <+MisterAvry> From Trick Pony
[2:29:10] <+TopTieramisu> @tussletoes what?? this game's swamp is gigantic. blighttown's swamp can be traversed quickly if you know where to go
[2:29:12] <+PrimalDweeb> Copy paste
[2:29:21] <@PlagueOfGripes> welcome to Dumpass Illinois
[2:29:33] <%g0atmeal> @TopTieramisu yea i find this swamp to be the worst tbh
