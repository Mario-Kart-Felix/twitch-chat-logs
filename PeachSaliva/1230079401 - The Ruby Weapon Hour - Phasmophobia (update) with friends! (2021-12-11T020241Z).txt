[0:02:10] <%king_wragles> AND Twitch notifications went off on the same day that she streamed! It's a server side miracle!
[0:02:19] <%SharkMissile> Haha yass :y
[0:02:20] <%JoshManVGH> Time for Gggggggg Good times!
[0:02:20] <%VashyronM> Oh golly, this is going to be fun
[0:02:26] <%SharkMissile> I'm so excited for this stream
[0:03:38] <%hewlettfan96> Damn the game awards was a joke I can’t believe I stayed up till 3 (England Clock) for it, what a joke
[0:04:05] <%FacetiousAF> FacetiousAF subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 18 months! you're all very pog

[0:05:18] <henshin2289> Ah it’s been a while since I’ve watched peach sundowner
[0:06:01] <%weapon000> I feel like Quantic Dream Star Wars is the irresistable force meets the immovable object.  No way is Disney gonna let him get weird with it but then again Cage gonna Cage.
[0:06:05] <VenDober> was afraid it would be doomed to PS3 forever
[0:06:25] <MittensBroadcast> yall ready for the wah wahs
[0:06:37] <%SharkMissile> @Madinki I'm...I'm sorry what? WHAT?

[0:17:53] <lemon_lover28> sound seemed fine?
[0:17:53] <sydowoodo> the music for her brb sounds distorted too
[0:17:58] <$GeneralSCPatton> @baka_sugoi Wow, nice. Take Two can get fucked with their copyright shit.

[0:18:16] <@SoFarFetched> @islandsunn the BRB music
[0:18:24] <islandsunn> ah ok
[0:18:39] <@SoFarFetched> it might just be some internet issue or something.

[0:48:44] <MyNameIsRasus> Paige it's not picking up your audio
[0:48:46] <BigYanno> "Have you been in an accident that is not your fault?"
[0:48:47] <Haldosprime> You know I bet this spook doesn't like jazz.
[0:48:47] <+jjgamez64> I think you gotta press the local voice button
[0:48:52] <SocialMisfitGamer> like "fuck off, stupid"
[0:48:53] <TurtlesAndTentacles> So the point of the game is so they all die?
[0:48:55] <%weapon000> @tempestzephyr Piss off ghost!
[0:49:07] <MaesePC> @PeachSaliva you have to press the game voice button
