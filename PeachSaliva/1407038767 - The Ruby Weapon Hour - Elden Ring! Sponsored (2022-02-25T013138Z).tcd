I'm slowly going crazy but this device is like a time capsule of nostalgia from a bygone age of my history. It's pretty cool but it sucks tho.

[0:58:03] <%Brassnarwhal> @mostuselesscoinever when i fought the beastman the stuttering hid all of his windups so his attacks were almost unavoidable
[0:58:09] <+ThomasOfTroy> Maybe there's treasure?
[0:58:12] <+blastyoboots> I dunno why bloodstains don't seem to work in this very initial area but that's consistent
[0:58:15] <MarysCherry> maybe its a path? (the blood)
[0:58:17] <+blastyoboots> later bloodstains will work

[1:11:47] <+johnny_scissors> It just doesn't have PS button prompts
[1:11:52] <%Brassnarwhal> @imadoc91 i think she meant button prompts
[1:11:53] <+SergeEXE> THERE'S A COMPASS
[1:11:56] <+imadoc91> Did ahh
[1:11:59] <$Sphincter_Spelunker> the first step is admitting
[1:12:14] <%Brassnarwhal> @imadoc91 but honestly i wasnt paying full attention
[1:12:20] <+johnny_scissors> Just gotta enjoy getting lost
[1:12:28] <+imadoc91> unfortunately with my ds4 though the RT is broken, and only works if I mash it super hard
[1:12:29] <+badhaye> Your game is running waay smoother than mine. I was hitching constantly.
[1:12:36] <$Falilth> double down on all of your bad ideas always
[1:12:45] <ScreamLord> Paige only denies her wrong doings to spite Pat
[1:12:54] <Monkeyweed21> I've been testing the pc version of Elden Ring, and found out why the performance is having problems. Its straight up a bunch of problems from when DS3 launched on PC, where the game hates running in high resolution, the auto save causes stutter, and the antialiasing uses a disproportionate amount of juice. if you have problems try turning off anti aliasing and make sure windows is running the game uncapped
[1:12:56] <+imadoc91> best part is I played through all of ds3 last week and didn't even realize it was broken.
[1:13:01] <$Sphincter_Spelunker> holy essay batman
[1:13:11] <%legendfather_of_giants> the stutters happen when a new area/entity loads in for the first time
[1:13:14] <+johnny_scissors> You don't need to engage with parrying at all.  Tons of ways to stagger enemies now
[1:13:24] <+badhaye> @Monkeyweed21 Thanks! will try
[1:13:25] <+Bailey__Gaming> @monkeyweed21 how?
[1:13:25] <%OctaivianRex> When I launched this the first time it tried to use my integrated graphics card instead of my 3060
[1:13:25] <+RushUnplugged> I get some random slowdown but overall playable, I hope they fix it soon for everyone
[1:13:39] <BackflipCharm> Wow nice parry!
[1:13:39] <$Sphincter_Spelunker> parrying is for dex users
[1:13:41] <%cade_calrayn> Fuck it, we'll do it Unga Bunga
[1:13:41] <ScreamLord> Too be fair these guys are annoying to parry
[1:13:43] <+SWFanatic> Parry this you casual zombo
[1:13:51] <MandMGrease> Dont worry, there's alternatives
[1:13:57] <%RayReborne> Crouch like da Sekiro
[1:13:57] <%Brassnarwhal> @monkeyweed21 monkeyweed spreading the good word to multiple chats, i love it
[1:13:58] <$Falilth> those guys parry window sucks because they pause so long
[1:14:03] <%chitinoir> won't need to parry once you have an ax  bigger than you are
[1:14:08] <+Bailey__Gaming> SNEAKING MISSION
[1:14:10] <+SWFanatic> get the butt
[1:14:13] <+genepark> PAIGE WELCOME TO THE RING
[1:14:23] <buuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuut> Weed
[1:14:24] <+imadoc91> I'm not having too many problems with it, except occasional stutter, but with freesync turned on you don't notice it too bad
[1:14:27] <+SWFanatic> butt slaughtered
[1:14:27] <$Sphincter_Spelunker> be vewy vewy qwiet
[1:14:31] <%Brassnarwhal> @monkeyweed21 i will test changing those settings after i eat
[1:14:32] <Monkeyweed21> @Bailey__Gaming theres a post on the Elden Ring sub explaining the windows cap thing, basically Windows might be artificially limiting how much juice the game can use, so go to graphics in the windows bar and then look for Elden Ring and set to high performance
[1:14:35] <+MidnightBasker> @SergeEXE Where do you think that mod'll be? Nexus or does ER have workshop support?
[1:14:55] <%Brassnarwhal> @monkeyweed21 the windows game bar?
[1:14:56] <%legendfather_of_giants> @PeachSaliva it's just enemy poise
[1:14:56] <BackflipCharm> Big attacks make enemy stagger more.
[1:14:59] <Makr0ss> elden ring and the ringu killer on DBD, coincidence?
[1:15:03] <+notsoy> it's poise/posture
[1:15:06] <ScreamLord> Stance = Poise
[1:15:07] <%RayReborne> BIG
[1:15:09] <+SWFanatic> come on and slam
[1:15:11] <MandMGrease> HELMSPLITTER
[1:15:12] <+imadoc91> but this is the first big new game I'm playing with my new GPU and I upgraded from an RX580 so I'm not exactly used to smooth buttery performance
[1:15:12] <%RayReborne> STRONG
[1:15:15] <+Bailey__Gaming> jump attack good
[1:15:22] <%VentWilsn> MARIA Kappa
[1:15:22] <$Sphincter_Spelunker> Murica
[1:15:24] <+blastyoboots> MURICA
[1:15:24] <+SABiscotti> merica
[1:15:25] <%AsHeadsIsTails> Murica
[1:15:25] <+imadoc91> So I guess I'm just not picky
[1:15:25] <%maskofmichael> 'MERICA
[1:15:31] <%ChrisPlaysThing> Murica'
[1:15:32] <peachy996> MURICA
[1:15:33] <Monkeyweed21> @Brassnarwhal cant say for certain since performance is so inconsistent but turning off JUST antialiasing caused my framerate in the open world to double
[1:15:36] <peachy996> FUCK YEAh
[1:15:36] <penitentpendant> Checkpoints~
[1:15:42] <+blastyoboots> ye u can choose
[1:15:49] <femto216> Yihaaaaa
[1:15:51] <DancesWitBalrog> KKona
[1:15:53] <+blastyoboots> nope
[1:15:59] <%RayReborne> its automatic
[1:16:00] <BoneSkore> She's just one Merica. A Merica, if you will
[1:16:02] <%Brassnarwhal> @imadoc91 i had boss attacks fully hide in the stutter so it does impact gameplay not just looks
[1:16:10] <ScreamLord> You mean Gold?
[1:16:16] <%Brassnarwhal> @monkeyweed21 that sounds great to me
[1:16:19] <critiquequartz> I think its supposed to be gold
[1:16:19] <Monkeyweed21> @Brassnarwhal no in Windows system settings, like type in graphics into the windows search bar
[1:16:23] <%VentWilsn> imagine being so conceited you name ur child "Godrick"
[1:16:23] <%OctaivianRex> Literally just a guy.
[1:16:27] <%RayReborne> R2
[1:16:32] <%MooseIsGoose> So guard and then R2
[1:16:33] <%MightyDuckShoes> Fuck his day up!

[1:16:57] <DancesWitBalrog> 1?
[1:17:00] <+barrakuta371> smoked
[1:17:12] <NocturneNovember> @DancesWitBalrog 1
[1:17:17] <%RayReborne> i think, its similar to a sound effect from it
[1:17:20] <%Brassnarwhal> thats when you attack not from the block
[1:17:21] <femto216> I love that noise
[1:17:26] <BoneSkore> runes are for scaping
[1:17:27] <critiquequartz> kinda? Its close to it
[1:17:45] <$Sphincter_Spelunker> looks like you're walking into sewer water
[1:17:48] <critiquequartz> Nice
[1:17:52] <%MooseIsGoose> Perfect
[1:17:52] <BackflipCharm> Hardest boss in the game down Pog
[1:17:54] <goblinpuppy> nice!
[1:17:57] <%RayReborne> and then R1 cuz he staggered
[1:17:57] <+SABiscotti> Big
[1:17:59] <ScreamLord> Literally just some guy
[1:17:59] <%Brassnarwhal> @boneskore you mmo posted in the wrong rpg neighborhood
[1:18:01] <MandMGrease> Do you have the music turned off?
[1:18:01] <Monkeyweed21> @Brassnarwhal keep in mind this is just preliminary testing, we're gonna need people who really know their stuff like Durante to diagnose every issue people are having
[1:18:23] <%Brassnarwhal> @monkeyweed21 I'll take experimental treatments over waiting
[1:18:37] <%FacetiousAF> ?????

[1:18:39] <penitentpendant> Loading goes Brrr
[1:18:52] <%MooseIsGoose> lol
[1:18:52] <Monkeyweed21> its the auto-save/load stutter from launch DS3
[1:18:53] <$Sphincter_Spelunker> there's music?
[1:18:57] <%Brassnarwhal> @mandmgrease dark souls games are very quiet, there will likely only be music occasionally
[1:19:02] <%RayReborne> @peachsaliva Monkeyweed in chat has excellent advice for helping improve framerate

[1:23:25] <+Freakin_Wolfy> Is she aware reading comprehension is a thing?
[1:23:25] <+SergeEXE> it's a Dark Souls 3
[1:23:26] <%cade_calrayn> remember blue Estus from DS3?
[1:23:28] <%MooseIsGoose> Yup
[1:23:28] <AluxDoesNotStream> yo that's dope
[1:23:32] <SGrim> Yes
[1:23:33] <%greasypete00> you had to go to andre for it
[1:23:34] <%cade_calrayn> You just never used Magic in DS3
[1:23:38] <%RayReborne> oh no, Pat did it for her psaOno
[1:23:38] <critiquequartz> paige
[1:23:39] <%legendfather_of_giants> because you used no FP in 3 paige
[1:23:41] <critiquequartz> whenever
[1:23:41] <%greasypete00> you can change them any time
[1:23:43] <Monkeyweed21> you never used magic
[1:23:43] <%MooseIsGoose> You can change at any time
[1:23:45] <+doc_ock_rokc> you can always change it
[1:23:47] <+ThomasOfTroy> You never touched it in 3
[1:23:48] <+johnny_scissors> Change it at any bonfire
[1:23:50] <+ThomasOfTroy> ye
[1:23:57] <%legendfather_of_giants> @PeachSaliva FP also fuels your weapon abilities, which are super good
[1:23:58] <%MooseIsGoose> Yes
[1:23:59] <penitentpendant> Yes
[1:24:00] <+skizzuto> yes

[1:24:34] <%RayReborne> its finally here
[1:24:39] <DancesWitBalrog> Paige not use the weapon arts anyway
[1:24:43] <critiquequartz> like bloodborne vials
[1:24:45] <DancesWitBalrog> might
[1:24:46] <$Sphincter_Spelunker> thought they already did that in bloodborne
[1:24:47] <Makr0ss> that was on ds3 too
[1:24:53] <luftraumm1> yo PEACH
[1:25:00] <Chaos_Aether> bloodborne did the same
[1:25:01] <+doc_ock_rokc> Paige literally chose "Unga Bunga" the class
[1:25:11] <+RigmaroleHM> Never stop picking everything up
[1:25:22] <Chaos_Aether> Im Snitching
[1:25:32] <luftraumm1> is paige big and/or strong?

[1:26:18] <Makr0ss> adhd the game
[1:26:21] <%cade_calrayn> basically it's the names that are confusing you, most of the concepts in the game are the same, they just have fancy new names and so you don't remember em. from what I saw of Pat's stream, everything should be very familiar with a different label

[1:32:10] <%RayReborne> you good, you won't die
[1:32:10] <+abakkus> a swamp? perchance
[1:32:23] <%RayReborne> nah
[1:32:27] <%MooseIsGoose> swamp run in it
[1:32:30] <%cade_calrayn> FYI, fall damage is significantly *less* a thing in this game but it still is a thing
[1:32:31] <%RayReborne> just a puddly lake
[1:32:34] <jetpack_rorschasch> Get ready for swamp!
[1:32:34] <%SophiaAmoreaVeritas> Nice roll.
[1:32:42] <%zamatermort> Its a large puddle
[1:32:59] <+doc_ock_rokc> try jumping
[1:33:00] <%MooseIsGoose> Break any skull on the ground sometimes they have items
[1:33:01] <+abakkus> what is a puddle if not a small swamp in training
[1:33:06] <Monkeyweed21> jump no balls
[1:33:10] <+OrangeMDT> Oh no. She crouch walkin
[1:33:23] <%ChrisPlaysThing> Stutter strongk
[1:33:27] <Monkeyweed21> They look GORGEOUS at night
[1:33:29] <@SoFarFetched> I like how paige caught herself geefO
[1:33:40] <%ChrisPlaysThing> Might just be my 8 year QA eyes though
[1:33:56] <%cade_calrayn> "We'll sneak by" she says, moments before somersaulting into a wagon
[1:34:01] <%MooseIsGoose> You can beat them you got this
[1:34:03] <@SoFarFetched> Oh yeah its happening
[1:34:04] <+doc_ock_rokc> nope
[1:34:12] <+Caidezes> It's fine.
[1:34:25] <DancesWitBalrog> i hope this doesnt happen on PS5
[1:34:26] <%SophiaAmoreaVeritas> We're nowhere near that yet.
[1:34:28] <jetpack_rorschasch> Will do
[1:34:29] <Monkeyweed21> @PeachSaliva its the same problem DS3 had at launch where auto-saving or loading new areas causes stutter
[1:34:31] <%greasypete00> it just kinda lowers the framerate from what I've seen
[1:34:31] <@SoFarFetched> Paige you know us,we'll watch ANYTHING. EVen you accidentally starting your stream on pat's channel geefPlz
[1:34:34] <eduwardovich> Perfectly watchable
[1:34:35] <Komneni> I'd say it's fine.
[1:34:37] <%ChrisPlaysThing> My training makes it REALLY noticeable for me, so don't take my feedback too heavy
[1:34:41] <+TimberWulfe> you have a jump and can attack mid jump
[1:34:48] <AdmiralButtloaf> This Pokemon game doesnt look as bad as everyone says
[1:34:50] <%cade_calrayn> @DancesWitBalrog didn't happen during the eleven hours of Pat's PS5 stream I saw, the game is optimized for console
[1:34:50] <Kain5707> when wil fromsoft have a good pc port :(
[1:34:57] <%ChrisPlaysThing> nearing that decae of game industry work, i'm broken
[1:35:00] <%ChrisPlaysThing> decade*
[1:35:02] <Monkeyweed21> @Kain5707 Sekiro
[1:35:05] <jetpack_rorschasch> @AdmiralButtloaf LUL
[1:35:09] <%MooseIsGoose> @AdmiralButtloaf that was pretty good
[1:35:12] <+RigmaroleHM> Yucky
[1:35:17] <DancesWitBalrog> Fromsoft having a good PC port LUL
[1:35:24] <%RetroCop87> Paige, why you sneakin?
[1:35:37] <Monkeyweed21> dont worry about it
[1:35:43] <@PatStaresAt> @PeachSaliva It doesn't quite work that way. Going straight down that path would actually be too tough
[1:35:44] <%zamatermort> You're fine, it is a big explore typa game
[1:35:55] <3viltiki> I think you can smashy skulls
[1:35:55] <Monkeyweed21> Skull-o-ton
[1:35:55] <+RigmaroleHM> But there might be goodies
[1:36:01] <%RetroCop87> oh no
[1:36:06] <Komneni> If the optimal build for this game is Skyrim Stealth Archer I'm going to be upset.
[1:36:10] <%MooseIsGoose> can you teleport to other graces
[1:36:11] <%RayReborne> Oh no
[1:36:11] <$thomassolorio> o ya
[1:36:12] <%MooseIsGoose> Run
[1:36:12] <Monkeyweed21> just some teens having a bonfire party

[1:36:51] <+dreadd_wolfsbane> LOLOLOL
[1:36:56] <%zamatermort> The only thing I didn't manage to kill in the network test
[1:36:56] <NocturneNovember> no honse yet
[1:36:57] <jetpack_rorschasch> He just wants to be friends.
[1:36:58] <$thomassolorio> break em
[1:36:58] <+RigmaroleHM> No thank you we don't want any
[1:36:59] <TurtlesAndTentacles> Paige is yelling so loud my mom asked what am I watching LUL
[1:36:59] <%SophiaAmoreaVeritas> High level boss, on the spot, let's go.
[1:37:01] <+Walopoh> ODDBALL
[1:37:01] <%zamatermort> Smack it
[1:37:02] <NocturneNovember> hit it
[1:37:02] <lloyddboy> hit it
[1:37:02] <+blastyoboots> psaBig Brave
[1:37:02] <%MooseIsGoose> Hit it
[1:37:04] <Komneni> Futbol
[1:37:06] <$thomassolorio> attack
[1:37:10] <%RayReborne> btw you can just warp to Graces from the map screen
[1:37:14] <Makr0ss> that's literally an alluring skull huh
[1:37:22] <%zamatermort> That's your soul item
[1:37:27] <goblinpuppy> "These bats look too tough" immediately triggers dragon
[1:37:32] <DancesWitBalrog> cold blood item
[1:37:44] <$thomassolorio> the fuckery is strong
[1:37:46] <%SophiaAmoreaVeritas> Have pocket numbers.
[1:37:53] <DancesWitBalrog> this loading will get her killed
[1:37:53] <%MooseIsGoose> I think you are stuck between like 3 loading areas
[1:37:59] <%zamatermort> The bat things? Way easier than the dragon, just fyi lol
[1:37:59] <%ChrisPlaysThing> oof
[1:38:15] <+doc_ock_rokc> Paige when you wipe out a group or camp you will be able to regain your estus
[1:38:18] <%ChrisPlaysThing> I kkep wanting to stop and write a bug LUL
[1:38:19] <+clausover> what platform is paige playing on?
[1:38:21] <thatdudenamedlogan> Those birds look weak
[1:38:22] <sothatsprettybrutal> pc
[1:38:34] <+SWFanatic> Quest to become Huge
[1:38:42] <%RayReborne> the next grace is behind him tho Kappa
[1:38:42] <+mrcake_dragonman> Heya. Is this game good?
[1:38:45] <DancesWitBalrog> hes friendly tho ;)
[1:39:02] <+TimberWulfe> has Paige seen the sheeps unique form of locomotion yet?
[1:39:04] <@SoFarFetched> that FAT roll
[1:39:10] <Monkeyweed21> It appears to be an issue with Shader caching
[1:39:22] <%greasypete00> that's probably one of the reasons the network test wasnt on PC
[1:39:23] <twistedj3ster> Do you know your specs?
[1:39:25] <critiquequartz> not gonna lie seems like a game id rather play than watch streams of
[1:39:25] <rytisone> horse is gonna ruin the performance then
[1:39:27] <Kain5707> its the same on all settings sadly
[1:39:31] <AdmiralButtloaf> its nice that not every person and animal is undead in this game
[1:39:35] <Monkeyweed21> it was an issue DS3 had at launch too
[1:39:36] <+imadoc91> It doesn't seem to have much of an effect changing settings
[1:39:40] <Explodincatz> anyone know the easiest class to start with?
[1:39:49] <+imadoc91> It only happens when you first enter new areas too
[1:39:53] <%DrBunni> yeah PC is stuttery for me and I have it down to medium/low
[1:39:57] <+SWFanatic> Even with all the gigaflops of skeleton porn?
[1:39:57] <Makr0ss> is your pc a tower or a laptop?
[1:40:03] <+imadoc91> after you revisit a place it shouldn't happen anymore
[1:40:07] <DancesWitBalrog> I cant wait for skull soccer to become a thing in this game
[1:40:16] <%ChrisPlaysThing> Looks liek Lost Ark Kappa
[1:40:19] <@SoFarFetched> SANTA CLAUS?
[1:40:20] <@SoFarFetched> geefGasp
[1:40:20] <rytisone> ho ho ho
[1:40:22] <Chaos_Aether> SANTA
[1:40:26] <%kyh9> I don't know why Fromsoft doesn't just hire someone else to optimize their games
[1:40:28] <critiquequartz> it really is just santa tho
[1:40:28] <@Jekado> wait... why
[1:40:29] <+doc_ock_rokc> HE SEES YOU WHEN YOUR SLEEPING HE KNOWS WHEN YOUR AWAKE
[1:40:30] <%RayReborne> Ho Ho Ho, buy my wares
[1:40:33] <@SoFarFetched> IT SSAANNNTAAAAAA
[1:40:35] <+abakkus> this guy's voice sounds so familiar
[1:40:40] <MidnightPacif1c> HolidaySanta
[1:40:42] <KamenWriter85> Do the dark souls laugh Kale!
[1:40:44] <DancesWitBalrog> Kale! i ate you this morning!...wait
[1:40:54] <+doc_ock_rokc> HE KNOWS IF YOUVE BEEN BAD OR GOOD SO BE GOOD FOR GOODNESS SAKE
[1:40:58] <Monkeyweed21> @DrBunni the stuttering is less to do with graphics settings and more to do with shader's being loaded in and out, Antialiasing also uses far more juice than any of the other graphics settings
[1:41:01] <%zamatermort> He is a leafy green high in iron
[1:41:24] <AluxDoesNotStream> What a nice young man.
[1:41:30] <shandytowne> I love that Paige has been avoiding following the main path so much she hasn’t even talked to Kalé yet
[1:41:36] <AdmiralButtloaf> they really were just: Fuck it. Santa Claus
[1:41:52] <Monkeyweed21> @DrBunni game was chugging for me on high but turning off anti-aliasing and leaving everything else at high doubled my framerate in the open world
[1:42:03] <+imadoc91> It runs pretty much the same for me at minimum settings 1080 and max settings 4k, so yeah I don't think settings will do anything for a lot of people
[1:42:21] <Chaos_Aether> yes
[1:42:22] <%greasypete00> yes
[1:42:24] <Monkeyweed21> VERY
[1:42:26] <%DrBunni> @Monkeyweed21 I'll have to try that later.
[1:42:26] <%RayReborne> caves are DARK so yes
[1:42:29] <+imadoc91> Torches are essential
[1:42:29] <%greasypete00> essential even
[1:42:31] <+SABiscotti> Yes there is BIG dark
[1:42:31] <%DrBunni> Torches are necessary
[1:42:36] <kaspa91> you need the crafting kit more
[1:42:36] <+johnny_scissors> You'll need it for some dungeons
[1:42:42] <+johnny_scissors> Unless you want to fight blind
[1:42:57] <DancesWitBalrog> i bet someone on the art team won a christmas bet; thats why this guy is in the game
[1:43:27] <%oAznoUta> is that guy dressed as fucking Santa Clause?
[1:43:48] <goblinpuppy> zelda bottles?
[1:43:55] <%RayReborne> dog
[1:43:56] <Chaos_Aether> you have us and pat
[1:43:59] <%VentWilsn> its a good thing you have that notepad, right?
[1:44:00] <+imadoc91> Man the combustion spell is so useful in this game now that it has like an actual combo
[1:44:03] <%RayReborne> if you know you know Kappa
[1:44:04] <DancesWitBalrog> zelda bottles
[1:44:08] <MidnightPacif1c> PotFriend
[1:44:13] <+imadoc91> I'm using it way more than my actual weapon
[1:44:28] <Monkeyweed21> @imadoc91 where did you find it? havent found any pyromancy yet
[1:44:39] <+imadoc91> I started as cleric
[1:44:48] <+SWFanatic> don't give up boney boy
[1:45:00] <+doc_ock_rokc> Glintstone arc man
[1:45:06] <+doc_ock_rokc> Clears ROOMS of enemies
[1:45:07] <+imadoc91> Kind of chuffed that pyro is pure faith now
[1:45:21] <DancesWitBalrog> TOO FYAST FOR THE NAKED EYE
[1:45:25] <+imadoc91> I don't want to be a faith loser, but I always play pyro
[1:45:37] <DancesWitBalrog> FYASTEST THING ALIVEEE
[1:45:44] <+doc_ock_rokc> makes sense
[1:45:47] <Monkeyweed21> @doc_ock_rokc its literally a vergil move lol
[1:45:47] <%Fuggins4U> sanic
[1:45:49] <shandytowne> He can really mooooove
[1:46:03] <+doc_ock_rokc> Most people I know that went into sundayschool all their lives ended up being MASSIVE pyros
[1:46:20] <+imadoc91> I guess that makes sense
[1:46:22] <%RayReborne> man i dont wanna play dex again i always play dex but that SWORD PAT GOT FROM THE ONE GUY OOOOOO
[1:46:32] <%RayReborne> TWO HANDED DEX UNGA
[1:46:37] <+imadoc91> Which sword?
[1:46:51] <%RayReborne> @imadoc91 the Gaol guys sword
[1:46:55] <+imadoc91> I'm looking for a good sword to fill the gap
[1:47:09] <+imadoc91> I hope there's a demon's scar equivalent in this game
[1:47:18] <Monkeyweed21> So faith gets pyromancies and transformation magic in addition to miracles, and mind gets water and blood magic alongside the usual regular and dark sorceries
[1:47:27] <%RayReborne> Im too partial to my Katanas lol
[1:47:32] <+Dayube> Is Str/Int hybrid viable?
[1:47:35] <+imadoc91> iDemon's scar and Witch's locks were my favorite weapons
[1:47:44] <+SABiscotti> wuh
[1:47:47] <+SWFanatic> wappy dog
[1:47:48] <+silverira> wah
[1:47:49] <+Golinvoxx> is the awy music suppose to sound so distroted and glitchy lol
[1:47:53] <MaximumOctober> wah
[1:47:53] <+imadoc91> @Monkeyweed21 Int also gets Frost
[1:47:54] <%RayReborne> Wahppy doggo
[1:48:07] <@SoFarFetched> @Golinvoxx that might be a twitch thing
[1:48:11] <Monkeyweed21> @Dayube strength int is guaranteed to have at least good weapon because of MLGS
[1:48:13] <@SoFarFetched> sometimes you gotta refresh or change video quality
[1:48:18] <%ChrisPlaysThing> better
[1:48:20] <peachy996> Sometimes Twitch does that
[1:48:22] <%RayReborne> Excuse me Dark souls?
[1:48:24] <MandMGrease> He started as Prisoner
[1:48:26] <mr_saturday93> he's on elden ring not ds
[1:48:29] <Monkeyweed21> @imadoc91 so int gets liquid magic in general, which means CUM MAGIC
[1:48:30] <%RayReborne> what's that Kappa

[1:48:57] <buuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuut> It’s dark souls
[1:49:00] <%cade_calrayn> So that you can skip to nighttime and daytime and whatnot
[1:49:01] <+doc_ock_rokc> @PeachSaliva Some things only happen during the day or night

[1:51:19] <%RayReborne> @imadoc91 neat,ive tried regular weed before to little or no effect, so i hope edibles will be better
[1:51:19] <+thehotrefrigerator> Oh it's a rolly goat
[1:51:29] <%ChrisPlaysThing> Pat did it Kappa

[1:52:43] <%RayReborne> @imadoc91 oh god if im immune to weed that'll be a shame LUL
[1:53:02] <+doc_ock_rokc> Stealth apparently is for people who cannot onehand a battle axe
[1:53:13] <SixxMakaveli> So you mean Dex
[1:53:46] <+imadoc91> You might just need bigger quantities
[1:54:02] <EynoStiles> @peachsaliva Is Pat still playing Elden Ring?

[1:54:07] <MandMGrease> MURDERIZE IT

[2:21:14] <+condemned_15> The Three Fingered ones can take a lot more punishment
[2:21:15] <BedHome> @Houndemise PC version WILL EVENTUALLY be better after a few monthes of patches let alone eventual mods.  IF YOU CAN AFFORD BOTH, get ps5 now. if you can afford only 1, get PC and cope
[2:21:21] <%kyh9> She's saying you have no bitches, Paige
[2:21:21] <Makr0ss> JOI
[2:21:24] <Aussie_Manny> Get your mind out of the mustard-stained gutter.
[2:21:25] <%maskofmichael> Finger Bang Bang Into Your Heart!
[2:21:27] <DancesWitBalrog> if you finger maidens, wouldn't they be maidens no more?
[2:21:28] <thatdudenamedlogan> Elden Ring a metaphor for the clitoris
[2:21:29] <cowboy_plague_doctor> well are they a two finger maiden or a three finger maiden because the technique is different
[2:21:29] <@MelBrooksKA> Try Finger Maiden, but hole
[2:21:32] <%RayReborne> BITCH AQUIRED
[2:21:34] <%chitinoir> time for gal pal
[2:21:37] <%RetroCop87> "Are you the bearer of the Soul-banging finger?"
[2:21:37] <%kyh9> All this talk of fingering and feet has me uncomfortable

[2:22:06] <+SWFanatic> Pirate Bay has chosen you

[2:22:10] <$Sphincter_Spelunker> she's a horse girl huh
[2:22:13] <+SWFanatic> You wouldn't download a horse...
[2:22:25] <YakumoYomi> @SoFarFetched Kreygasm
[2:22:26] <%thejimjamz> "Tell me how to finger maidens" didnt someone claim you had lesbian hands that one time
[2:22:28] <Houndemise> Yeah I much rather buy one version. Guess I’ll play on pc it with jank until they fix it
[2:22:33] <$thomassolorio> geb apbol

[2:22:55] <@SoFarFetched> well you better go catch it
[2:22:56] <@SoFarFetched> Kappa
[2:22:58] <%RetroCop87> what's the junk stat in this game?
[2:23:10] <jetpack_rorschasch> You better catch it then. Kappa
[2:23:11] <Makr0ss> BiG
[2:23:21] <+notsoy> all of them do actual things, but arcane is probably the least immediately useful
[2:23:22] <$Sphincter_Spelunker> all strongth
[2:23:34] <DancesWitBalrog> which one is Luck? Lucky Ted must return
[2:23:41] <+notsoy> press Help button to see
[2:23:44] <Aussie_Manny> ALL video game steeds deserve respect. Roach. Agro. Kage. Highwind.
[2:23:46] <thebalticguy1> its luck
[2:23:50] <@SoFarFetched> should do the help to see all all the stats
[2:23:50] <%RayReborne> yeah both but for you is just luck
[2:23:57] <SixxMakaveli> So what is Intelligence in this game?
[2:24:05] <@MelBrooksKA> Time for Arcane Al
[2:24:18] <Aussie_Manny> Arcane? Oh, the misery
[2:24:21] <thebalticguy1> blue bar
[2:24:23] <+SABiscotti> yeah
[2:24:24] <+notsoy> focus is for magic and weapon arts iirc
[2:24:26] <%RayReborne> Summons yeah and weapon arts
[2:24:27] <+RushUnplugged> FP is for spells and weapon skills
[2:24:30] <%thejimjamz> its a really nice quality of life feature. you just know plague hates that they put it in
[2:24:50] <BigYanno> Dex is STRONG
[2:24:56] <%RayReborne> honse combat for real with dex
[2:25:01] <BigYanno> Dex may be the meta
[2:25:15] <DancesWitBalrog> I want to see Plague festering in his hatred for this game
[2:25:31] <SixxMakaveli> I feel like they gonna nerf Dex in the future
[2:25:32] <%RayReborne> LUL
[2:25:35] <%thejimjamz> Love you Eli
[2:25:37] <+notsoy> vig end str, BIGGEST
[2:25:38] <BigYanno> Plague hates everything, even the things he loves
[2:25:41] <jetpack_rorschasch> He hates everything though.
[2:25:42] <%CopperTucker> is Paige having fun?
[2:25:42] <BigYanno> and we love him for it
[2:25:44] <penitentpendant> Biggest weapons require biggest STR
[2:25:46] <+Alopekis> Big endurance, big strength
[2:25:49] <penitentpendant> Might as well start investing
[2:25:52] <%RetroCop87> Plague will take one step into the open field, and complain that he can't see walls
[2:26:02] <%RayReborne> remember there are Dex Unga weapons
[2:26:07] <%thejimjamz> BIG AND STRONG
[2:26:26] <Momma_Shark_Sasha> omg first stream in awhile and Peach has glasses
[2:26:27] <penitentpendant> Some summons can be worth the Mind investment
[2:26:27] <+imadoc91> I'd like to think even plague won't be able to complain about this game
[2:26:29] <+imadoc91> but you know
[2:26:35] <+misdirectedwoo> apparently easy respeck later
[2:26:38] <BigYanno> As someone who LOVES jumping off things that are juuuuuust too high to survive Dex may be my jam
[2:26:44] <tanarath> dex unga?
[2:26:55] <%thejimjamz> 1 horse = 1 flask of tears. Seems fair
[2:27:03] <%RetroCop87> @imadoc91 Plague will complain that there's nothing to complain about
[2:27:13] <%RayReborne> so hold triangle then d pad
[2:27:14] <+SWFanatic> psaBork
[2:27:19] <$Sphincter_Spelunker> can you sacrifice him for a bigger jump like Yoshi
[2:27:29] <%RayReborne> go to pouch on the right
[2:27:36] <%sandrews> hold y
[2:27:47] <+misdirectedwoo> down
[2:27:51] <%RetroCop87> the steed feels so mobile that it almost feels wrong for a Souls-like game
[2:27:58] <%sandrews> oh it's not the the pouch
[2:27:58] <%RayReborne> no on the right of the menu
[2:28:04] <%MooseIsGoose> Go to menu then go right and the pouch is there
[2:28:19] <%Ranryu692> 1 hour til console launch
[2:28:21] <%thejimjamz> yo that horse is SICK
[2:28:29] <+imadoc91> There's a lot about this game that is kind of mind blowing
[2:28:35] <%sandrews> Ghorse
[2:28:41] <penitentpendant> The Hoat!
[2:28:42] <%RetroCop87> lol

[2:32:07] <tanarath> oh no, Pat id learn Paige's 'knock things down' ability, the melding continues.
[2:32:08] <%VentWilsn> need dexterity to handle all those dicks Kappa
[2:32:14] <penitentpendant> 1 upvote vs 500
[2:32:16] <tanarath> is learning
[2:32:28] <Aussie_Manny> "Seek defeating one-by-one" That one's pretty good.
[2:32:29] <$Sphincter_Spelunker> atpSuspect
[2:32:35] <Aussie_Manny> grass
[2:32:37] <%VentWilsn> this reminds me of the church area in the plateau in BOTW
[2:32:44] <+SWFanatic> butt destroyed
[2:32:57] <thatdudenamedlogan> This game has very intense death rattles
[2:33:09] <lloyddboy> yeah paige whack that bush
[2:33:34] <+imadoc91> Oh my god, combustion has a sprint attack now
[2:33:44] <+Alopekis> Did that guy go investigate or was that just coincidence?
[2:33:52] <tanarath> Maybe they need glasses
[2:33:54] <%RayReborne> Flail for fancy
[2:34:15] <lordkamina2> your one to talk
[2:34:24] <+Alopekis> We're all one to talk
[2:34:40] <@MelBrooksKA> Finally, a weapon paige can use while she flails around
[2:34:43] <%KingKrampus> KingKrampus subscribed with Prime. They've subscribed for 3 months! Hey Paige! This is my first 3 month subiversary, so I wanted to say: Thank you for all your years of kindness and sharing! If you ever want some quality skeleton voice acting, I'll be happy to DM you my friend's Bonely Hearts VA work for Sans & Papyrus!
[2:35:11] <%RayReborne> paige item
[2:35:34] <+Alopekis> EVIL butterflies
[2:35:40] <tanarath> Paige played some of Bonely Hearts on stream, I think
[2:35:55] <$Sphincter_Spelunker> LUL
[2:35:55] <penitentpendant> lol
[2:35:55] <+Alopekis> LOL
[2:35:56] <%RayReborne> LUL
[2:35:59] <%RayReborne> HI
[2:36:00] <+TaurusOxford> LMAO
[2:36:01] <lloyddboy> LUL
[2:36:04] <+Ne1son> HE KNOWS
[2:36:05] <penitentpendant> "Sup"
[2:36:07] <SixxMakaveli> He's like...really PAIGE
[2:36:10] <+TaurusOxford> Genuine comedy moment right there
[2:36:11] <+Alopekis> That might be the best reaction I've ever seen from an NPC
[2:36:33] <+thickshield> surprise! doggo!
[2:36:34] <vulpuspictus> did anyone clip that
[2:36:53] <penitentpendant> Someone clip that gold!
[2:36:53] <+SABiscotti> yo the TREE
[2:36:55] <+Ne1son> The bats know how to sonicboom
[2:36:58] <+Alopekis> I hope so. Something about him just stopping and staring down at her like "What are you doing?" killed me.
[2:36:58] <%VentWilsn> omg those are manbat sized bats
[2:37:06] <+TaurusOxford> strategic cowardice
[2:37:17] <%chitinoir> I missed it, did she grab map for area?
[2:37:17] <@MelBrooksKA> She bravely ran away
[2:37:22] <%Dementedpenguin> Tactical retreat.
[2:37:24] <%maskofmichael> The Joestar Secret Technique
[2:37:27] <%RayReborne> lol yeah
[2:37:42] <@MelBrooksKA> Paige may be a coward, but she's a brave coward
[2:37:44] <+Alopekis> Maybe he is constipated. This is like medieval times. The food wasn't great.
[2:37:59] <%chitinoir> it's all that dung folks keep eating
[2:38:01] <+Alopekis> A brave, blind coward.
[2:38:02] <+SABiscotti> don't forget shiny in middle of camp, near a obelisk
[2:38:04] <penitentpendant> She bravely ran away, bravely did she bravely run~
[2:38:23] <AthenaAegis> Jeezus. I come in to see full on Unga Bunga Paige character Kappa
[2:38:27] <$Sphincter_Spelunker> saw what
[2:38:28] <tanarath> Bravely bravely run away, bravely Sir Saliva
[2:38:29] <+TaurusOxford> Stealth Bat!!!
[2:38:29] <@Jekado> inVISIBAT
[2:38:30] <%RayReborne> uh lol despawned i guess
[2:38:30] <thatdudenamedlogan> Those bats heard you call them pussies
[2:38:31] <%maskofmichael> why is the coward censored?
[2:38:33] <%Dementedpenguin> You scared it away.
[2:38:34] <$rdark_ksu> loooo
[2:38:34] <%VentWilsn> @Alopekis now im reminded of the Goodfood ad
[2:38:35] <penitentpendant> Enemy deloaded
[2:38:37] <+misdirectedwoo> server issue
[2:38:38] <+Alopekis> He went to the other dimension.
[2:38:48] <+misdirectedwoo> same happend to me earlier
[2:38:49] <%chitinoir> I think he phased out cuz morning
[2:38:54] <SUSYOSANCHEZ> Is it day time?
[2:38:56] <KamenWriter85> Shadowrealmed
[2:39:18] <@MelBrooksKA> THIS IS A STEALTH MISSION
[2:39:46] <penitentpendant> Map GETTU
[2:39:48] <%RayReborne> ok phew
[2:39:55] <$SinisterBroccoli> for some reason the random ghosts seem more there
[2:40:04] <@Jekado> map is still weird for a souls like
[2:40:55] <@Jekado> they are paiges people sipsipSipsipblind
[2:41:03] <+Alopekis> I think all Souls games should have maps. And minimaps in the top left corner.
[2:41:07] <+ShutUpAceyP> where are the other players in this mmo?
[2:41:14] <$SinisterBroccoli> first time I've caught a stream in a bit, those your new glasses peach?
[2:41:15] <+Alopekis> And they should show enemy locations as red dots.
[2:41:17] <$SinisterBroccoli> they're cute
[2:41:40] <%RayReborne> i must assert dominance iver their corpses Kappa
[2:41:45] <+SWFanatic> suck what?
[2:41:45] <%DoomUnderTheStairs> for bigger world souls games like this a world map is fine but minimaps would make it too easy for past games I feel
[2:41:46] <%VentWilsn> i just say "DIE!!!"
[2:41:48] <$cooldude69xx> I like "titties"
[2:41:51] <IminyourBase> if they are dead how do they know you are telling them to "suck it"?
[2:41:57] <+Alopekis> I usually tell them "Sorry" and then feel bad.
[2:41:57] <%RayReborne> @cooldude69xx what lol
[2:42:04] <+ShutUpAceyP> what does these enemies have upon to suck it?
[2:42:10] <SUSYOSANCHEZ> EAT SHIT AND LIVE!
[2:42:15] <Aussie_Manny> I usually go with Dave Chappelle's "GOTCHA, BITCH!".
[2:42:31] <$cooldude69xx> @RayReborne There are few things I like as much
[2:42:48] <%SophiaAmoreaVeritas> Very
[2:42:53] <+Alopekis> There was traffic in your brain
[2:42:56] <%DoomUnderTheStairs> it's taken me an hourly and half on the character creation alone sipsipDab
[2:43:05] <%VentWilsn> i sometimes say "ur done" like chris tucker from Rush Hour 2
[2:43:14] <DancesWitBalrog> that shadow was going nuts
[2:43:20] <%DoomUnderTheStairs> rush hour 2 is a classic
[2:43:32] <$Sphincter_Spelunker> he ain't gonna be in Rush Hour 3
[2:43:38] <Aussie_Manny> HONK HONK, I'M A THOUGHT wifiFunnyPinkCar
[2:43:41] <%RayReborne> time for shield uh oh
[2:43:44] <+Alopekis> Whichever Rush Hour movie people don't like is the real classic.
[2:43:55] <%VentWilsn> so 3?
[2:44:03] <lloyddboy> F
[2:44:07] <%SophiaAmoreaVeritas> F
[2:44:07] <+TaurusOxford> Game over YEEEEEEEEEEEAH
[2:44:12] <%VentWilsn> are you barefoot?
[2:44:12] <jetpack_rorschasch> Kappa
[2:44:13] <%RayReborne> luckily, runes are right here
[2:44:13] <+Alopekis> Sure, that one. It was a real, genuine classic and all the others are overhyped garbage.
[2:44:14] <Aussie_Manny> DID HE JUST PARRY YOU?!
[2:44:19] <$SinisterBroccoli> rush hour 3 is good tho
[2:44:19] <penitentpendant> Need to practice switching between 2 hand weapon and shield
[2:44:27] <+SABiscotti> he did a guard counter
[2:44:28] <@MelBrooksKA> Okay, I'm heading to bed, you kids play nice
[2:44:34] <%SophiaAmoreaVeritas> You're ten feet from your Runes.
[2:44:34] <+imadoc91> Oof, on my first real boss, they really like doing that weird attack delay thing, like ds 3 in this game don't they
[2:44:37] <$cooldude69xx> @Aussie_Manny Not quite
[2:45:08] <SUSYOSANCHEZ> Careful, enemies are close.
[2:45:11] <$Sphincter_Spelunker> atpCap
[2:45:13] <YakumoYomi> Boooooo!
[2:45:16] <+SWFanatic> nice
[2:45:28] <+Alopekis> Elden Ring is like if you took Dark Souls 1, mixed it with Dark Souls 3, and then added in a small amount of Demon's Souls.
[2:45:29] <@PatStaresAt> @PeachSaliva its nuts paige you seem to be the only person who streamed on PC thats having little to no issues
[2:45:46] <$Sphincter_Spelunker> The horse chugs her PC
[2:46:00] <@PatStaresAt> oh darn
[2:46:05] <+Alopekis> Congrats Paige.
[2:46:10] <+imadoc91> I'm not streaming, but I'm having no issues really, aside from the stutter
[2:46:16] <Makr0ss> some stutters here and there
[2:46:22] <%RayReborne> souls on CompASS btw
[2:46:30] <%Ranryu692> psaCrazyhead
[2:46:33] <+Ne1son> You get pride
[2:46:35] <$Sphincter_Spelunker> gratification
[2:46:40] <+imadoc91> Nah, I always have preferred it honestly
[2:46:40] <%RayReborne> the runes they drop lol
[2:46:42] <SUSYOSANCHEZ> Flask refill
[2:46:48] <+Alopekis> I haven't had too many issues either. Some small frame drops here and there, but nothing too bad. Especially compared to what I've seen happening with other people. Hopefully they'll fix up the PC port quickly cause the game is great otherwise.
[2:46:50] <%realm_forge> @patstaresat What be pirate’s favorite letter?
[2:46:50] <$cooldude69xx> I get lights flickering no matter what settings I use. Annoying, but not a deal breaker
[2:46:55] <+imadoc91> performance is still ass on playstation in souls games
[2:47:08] <+imadoc91> souls games just don't perform well on anything
[2:47:42] <@Jekado> he tried sneaking
[2:48:02] <%JoshManVGH> THE BIG HAM
[2:48:11] <%Dementedpenguin> Yo, that jump dodge tho
[2:48:13] <+thickshield> i have invisible enemies all over, its a real bummer. hope a patch rolls out or something before long
[2:48:14] <$Sphincter_Spelunker> Hard As a Mofo
[2:48:14] <%RayReborne> @imadoc91 i mean 30 fps for most of them but its stable at least. 60 fps performance mode on ps5 works fine
[2:48:50] <+imadoc91> idk, farron swamp was awful in 3 on the ps4
[2:48:55] <penitentpendant> Victory!
[2:49:07] <%SophiaAmoreaVeritas> You guys had a good time together.
[2:49:12] <SUSYOSANCHEZ> VENGANCE
[2:49:17] <+imadoc91> only ds game I can think of with a consistent frame rate is SOTFS
[2:49:19] <$Sphincter_Spelunker> flask refill when kill groups
[2:49:19] <%RayReborne> nah
[2:49:24] <TurtlesAndTentacles> did she get the chest from the Caravan?
[2:49:25] <penitentpendant> Nope. There's a dungeon in this area though
[2:49:26] <critiquequartz> no
[2:49:26] <%Puhff> did you find Candace yet?
[2:49:27] <%RayReborne> they guard the chests you lotted
[2:49:42] <%realm_forge> @peachsaliva What be a pirate’s favorite letter?
[2:49:43] <Pookiedaexzile> Did you check all the carts?
[2:49:49] <penitentpendant> Or wait, do those stairs go to a dungeon? I forgot.
[2:49:51] <+imadoc91> as many problems as ds2 had, no one can say it didn't run well
[2:50:05] <+Alopekis> Dark Souls 2 was the best Souls game
[2:50:11] <SUSYOSANCHEZ> Pump stronk.
[2:50:12] <+Alopekis> Instant classic, 10/10
[2:50:14] <+imadoc91> (Its my favorite)
[2:50:17] <%RayReborne> time for greatsword?
[2:50:17] <lloyddboy> BIGSWORD TIME
[2:50:30] <+Alopekis> It's my favorite too, despite the issues. lol
[2:50:34] <+imadoc91> but I don't advertise it because people hate you because you tell the truth
[2:50:41] <+abakkus> grace kinda looks like golden humanity, now that I really look at it. huh.
[2:50:42] <%RayReborne> yup, hates pony
[2:51:08] <reemasbaid> I just watched woolie figure out shield mechanics AND THEN THIS HAPPENS LIKE OBOY
[2:51:12] <%RayReborne> paige you have big counter remember
[2:51:24] <%Puhff> shield counter bruv
[2:51:27] <+Alopekis> People who can't handle the fact that Dark Souls 2 is the best Dark Souls ever invented aren't real gamers.
[2:51:29] <%RayReborne> its great for these shield dudes
[2:51:37] <stellaspeed10> Twitter Queen is back at it
[2:51:45] <stellaspeed10> LUL
[2:51:49] <%VentWilsn> did you write anything in ur notebook yet?
[2:51:55] <%Puhff> fuck DS2s Estus flask
[2:51:58] <%cade_calrayn> why go clever when you can go big and strong?
[2:51:59] <%Puhff> I said it
[2:52:02] <+Alopekis> No
[2:52:03] <$Sphincter_Spelunker> I hope there are enemies with anti air.
[2:52:16] <+Alopekis> You don't fuck the DS2 estus flask, it fucks you!
[2:52:31] <+Alopekis> @Sphincter_Spelunker Like a missile launcher?
[2:52:33] <SUSYOSANCHEZ> I actually like Dark Souls 3 and hate all the other games.
[2:52:38] <saltyblackyouth> Is she just jumping and R2/1ing or there a dedicated jump button?
[2:52:42] <%RayReborne> hold triangle first if that helps
[2:52:47] <TurtlesAndTentacles> Try out calling, riding, and dismount while riding
[2:52:48] <%realm_forge> LEG DAY
[2:52:48] <+Alopekis> @SUSYOSANCHEZ You're wrong
[2:52:53] <+notsoy> you can also put the whistle on your item list
[2:52:53] <%VentWilsn> whats the buttons for pony again?
[2:53:02] <%Puhff> @salty X/A is Jump
[2:53:02] <rearedlogarithm> What the heck.

[2:53:16] <jetpack_rorschasch> Workshopping your skills Paige, impressive. SeemsGood
[2:53:16] <+Alopekis> I'm always wary of up
[2:53:17] <rasamune> up
[2:53:18] <saltyblackyouth> This scared TF out of me a few mins ago.
[2:53:19] <+imadoc91> sign ruining the surprise
[2:53:31] <+Alopekis> Go fight him with only your shield!
[2:53:33] <SUSYOSANCHEZ> Might give this game a shot after I finish Cyberpunk.
[2:53:38] <TurtlesAndTentacles> TOUCH GRACE
[2:53:44] <+Alopekis> LOL
[2:53:45] <penitentpendant> FUS RO DAH
[2:53:46] <rasamune> Ooh he comin
[2:53:49] <SixxMakaveli> Sonic boom
[2:53:49] <%RayReborne> DIDNT KNOW HE COULD DO THAT
[2:53:51] <goblinpuppy> rip
[2:53:58] <+HarmonicArsenal> ironmouseRIP
[2:54:03] <%maskofmichael> why did you kill the pony Paige?
[2:54:03] <+Alopekis> The Dragonborn got weird looking
[2:54:03] <Makr0ss> stoop kid
[2:54:04] <%SophiaAmoreaVeritas> Skyrim Souls
[2:54:09] <@PatStaresAt> i literally forgot to do this encounter fuck
[2:54:16] <tanarath> You can regain pony via summoning again, it'll use one estus.
[2:54:17] <%SophiaAmoreaVeritas> And no one can tell me otherwise.
[2:54:30] <%RayReborne> @patstaresat lol
[2:54:37] <%RayReborne> lol. lmao
[2:54:39] <$Sphincter_Spelunker> he got no ass
[2:54:41] <SixxMakaveli> It got a sword!
[2:54:49] <penitentpendant> @PatStaresAt You skyrim'd around it in an entertaining manner at least
[2:54:52] <+Alopekis> @tanarath Uh, these aren't Estus. They're Crimson Tears. Completely different.
[2:54:52] <+imadoc91> Yeah this guy is like not a thing I even bothered with
[2:54:53] <saltyblackyouth> Did paige get the gift that buffs her flasks or did she find the buff item?
[2:55:07] <%RayReborne> @saltyblackyouth gift
[2:55:19] <+imadoc91> Speaking of skyrim this guy gave me "troll on the way up the mouth of the world" vibes
[2:55:24] <+imadoc91> I just fucked past him
[2:55:26] <%DJLavender> DJLavender subscribed with Prime. 
[2:55:32] <+Alopekis> I like how he has a sword but apparently not interested in using it.
[2:55:38] <+imadoc91> throat of the world*
[2:55:45] <$Sphincter_Spelunker> good trade
[2:55:45] <KamenWriter85> Last Giant could NEVER
[2:55:47] <Gorgs7> I've been watching in the background and I feel like 90% of Paige's commentary is "Shit!...oh, shit!...Jesus!"
[2:55:53] <saltyblackyouth> @RayReborne Thanks! Just saved me from turning the game back on to find that
[2:55:57] <penitentpendant> Phase 2
[2:56:00] <TurtlesAndTentacles> PAige crouching makes you slower
[2:56:04] <%VentWilsn> YEA BIG SWORD TIME
[2:56:07] <+imadoc91> did he have crotch jiggle physics?
[2:56:10] <+Alopekis> Ah, there he goes. He figured it out.

[2:56:33] <LorcaNomad> did paige get the thing in the cart next to the grace?
[2:56:42] <@PatStaresAt> @PeachSaliva so earlier you mentioned you felt you should go that way, but that ambush is your hint to look around before hardlining it to Stormveil
[2:56:44] <+vehementvadr> miniboss?
[2:56:45] <%RayReborne> yee

[2:58:48] <%RayReborne> so marathoning Elden is the new Subathon? Kappa
[2:58:50] <Monkeyweed21> Based on early testing, the issue isnt optimization the game is just artificially limiting how much processing power and vram it can use
