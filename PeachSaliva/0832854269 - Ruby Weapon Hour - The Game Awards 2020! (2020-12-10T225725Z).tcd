[1:24:46] <coreyyotto> But you could always play as the humans
[1:24:46] <+michingmallecho> All L4D had was multiplayer. If you played by yourself... daphSlep
[1:24:46] <+SoySocks> this looks quite visually nice
[1:24:46] <$wolfofsound> why are you booing he's right
[1:24:47] <+Spag313> plague hates fun
[1:24:47] <boomstickery> it needs to be randomly gened maps
[1:24:47] <mach01_> supertank that grabs players is actually a dope idea tho
[1:24:48] <+Frost_Quill> Playing as the zombies was the best, yeah.
[1:24:49] <+Pookiedaexzile> Plague you sweet summer child have you never played as a hunter
[1:24:49] <CappuccinoGuil> this actually looks... beautiful???
[1:24:50] <+StromkoPenguin> I remember being kicked for playing the Hunter and jumping too much. :)
[1:24:50] <mattynezz> I have literally thousands of hours in L4D, Vs was the only way to play
[1:24:50] <$ItsRatman> VS was fun but SUPER toxic
[1:24:50] <+logus313> I can't fucking wait
[1:24:53] <tsnakesrule> Pat is righ5
[1:24:53] <Decsevm> paige has always been big scared of loosing her channel that has been always the way like super panicked about dah single tiddie and about not having the right game up or else everything is gone
[1:24:53] <phatmac16> PAT IS CORRECT
[1:24:54] <+animaturgy> Who the fuck played L4D as PvE only>

[2:17:04] <+cmdrmobium> It looks like a late 2000s blizzard trailer
[2:17:04] <+BeardedLuchador> it's because they keep speeding up the last few frames of the attacks I think

[3:41:06] <+TheIntellectional> it should be
[3:41:06] <%hrbeck_> public domain mfer
[3:41:06] <eco419> Civ
[3:41:07] <+BigDumBeak> its DEFINITLY public domain
[3:41:08] <puse9> humankind
[3:41:08] <+MisterAvry> it's public domain
[3:41:08] <%Promessa_EX> public domain af
[3:41:09] <nivlac_555> maybe specific performances can be copyrighted?
[3:41:09] <+desfore> Specific recordings can still be claimed as DMCA
[3:41:09] <cipher758> public domain
[3:41:09] <Gallhint> oh my good god you guys lmao
[3:41:11] <+Whiskey_T_Foxtrot> it doesn't fucking matter. Royalty free shit still gets claimed.
[3:41:11] <koffeemancer> it should be public domain
[3:41:12] <SomeSageAdvice> they have claimed royalty free music before
[3:41:12] <+PleasantLee> hall of the mountain king should be public domain
[3:41:12] <Srg_oatz> DUDE THE SONG IS 150 YEARS OLD
[3:41:13] <+skyheys> What the FUCK Paige
[3:41:14] <WealthBeyondMeasure> WHO THE FUCK WOULD OWN HALL OF THE MOUNTAIN KING FUCKING GIMLI?
[3:41:15] <%heartlesshealer> They fucking claim public domain shit anyway
[3:41:16] <+JenovasPuppet> This is fucking weird.
[3:41:16] <MasterMushin> Awaken My Masters!
[3:41:17] <OneThousandTomatoes> deconfirm the apearance of Elden Ring already so we can leave this farce of a show
[3:41:17] <+Scevda> Public domain....
[3:41:18] <Zebekis> It SHOULD be okay
[3:41:18] <+chicken_danger> ENDLESS TRASH
[3:41:19] <ninjaguiden> wacky blue hair
[3:41:19] <peachy996> It could still DMCA you
[3:41:19] <%Sotetsu> The Humankind beta was so not fun. Very disappointing.
[3:41:20] <AGRO_91> incoming MODERNDAAAAAAAAAAAAY
[3:41:20] <DianaTheAscian> Paige this song is old as shit
[3:41:21] <+QueequegTheater> @PeachSaliva Hall of the Mountain King is extremely Public domain
[3:41:21] <fuchard1996> its public domain but it'll get claimed anyway
[3:41:23] <+cgreene64> The recording itself might not be in the public domain
[3:41:24] <Hoodywolf> public domain
[3:41:25] <KitsuneManami> Whats this Tumblr Girl+?
[3:41:25] <Emperor_Machinus> ACDC?
[3:41:25] <%Aztec50> yeah but is this recording under public domain?
[3:41:26] <%BinaryFireball> The recoridng might not
[3:41:26] <%falineth> the song is but a specific performance? perhaps
[3:41:26] <mach01_> Its civilization
[3:41:26] <Jack_of_No_Trades> Performances can be copyright but the song is too old
[3:41:29] <+Ophill> its perfomance can still be DMCAd
[3:41:29] <%TheWinged7> @PeachSaliva while the song is, individual recordings can be DMCAd
[3:41:29] <+croxeye> idk this seems like a remix version
[3:41:30] <+Walopoh> It doesn't stop music companies
[3:41:30] <boomstickery> just reminds me of Alton Towers
[3:41:31] <Namaztak> the music itself is public domain, but specific performances are not
[3:41:32] <+shradke> Paige is too paranoid
[3:41:32] <tonfirean> the specific performance can still be under copyright
[3:41:33] <+Kickin_Against_the_Switz> yeah people claim everything, sadly public domain doesn't clear it:/
[3:41:33] <+Pookiedaexzile> AAAAAND DMCA
[3:41:35] <+jjhoho> it should be BUT the actual law doesn't really have bearing on DMCA
[3:41:35] <HumanAdventure> It's a public domain song, but this recording of it is copyrighted.
[3:41:36] <+Intersceptre> Hall of the Mountain Dew
[3:41:36] <Karhax> you can own the performance
[3:41:37] <Tha_Mik> Some dj will claim it anyway
[3:41:38] <+your_big_dad> The performance might not be public domain
[3:41:39] <ToneBacas> what is this even
[3:41:39] <%McSoliace> public domain don't mean shit to dmca
[3:41:39] <dots4eyes> It's fine to be paranoid Paige...because DMCA is stupid.
[3:41:39] <+desfore> Specific recordings can be copyrighted
[3:41:40] <AmericanaRed> LAST BOSS COVID
[3:41:40] <+IMightBeRusty> so awful that LOU2 won direction and narrative
[3:41:43] <ammobasket> Composition maybe, but that performance may be copyrighted
[3:41:43] <+MisterAvry> We understand your hesitance, Paige. Twitch am a fuck
[3:41:45] <PrettyThickandStrongDyck> Paige big brain
[3:41:45] <RetroGiinthir> Is it royalty free she asks, looking at a queen being crowned
[3:41:47] <%Promessa_EX> but the performance is probably made by this game company
[3:41:50] <%YakumoYomi> @WealthBeyondMeasure That wouldn't stop some fuck from claiming it, quite frankly
[3:41:50] <+cvp5127> you barely use it
[3:41:51] <+QueequegTheater> BUT WHO WAS MOUNTAiN KING
[3:41:51] <+Anime_Flux> The song itself is public domain, but the performance of said song can be claimed... so....
[3:41:51] <+MeatBomb> Stadia!
[3:41:51] <%T_Sasquatch> she is really hot
[3:41:52] <nivlac_555> you're not paranoid

[3:50:25] <I_OneGuy_Over_Heaven_I> get ready for TLOU2
[3:50:25] <%Bluwizard21> Last of us needs to die in a fire
[3:50:25] <rReizs> too much gameplay in hades
[3:50:26] <aiutare47> I legit wonder if money changed hands this year. I know people say that every year but seriously, TLOU2 was very controversial yet won ALL these awards.
[3:50:26] <Wyrmsblood> CK3 should be game of the year
[3:50:27] <sydowoodo> hell yeah. my goty
[3:50:27] <chestersan> No it's gonna be animal crossing
[3:50:27] <%g0atmeal> oh man imagine if it were animal crossing
[3:50:28] <$Sphincter_Spelunker> Get your Christmas Bonuses, Naughty Dog
[3:50:29] <+PipIV> ANIMAL CROSSING BBY
[3:50:29] <+QueequegTheater> Pat what does that mean? It's good, but not as good as Ghost or Doom
[3:50:30] <+CptnCampy61> Hades or Ghost
[3:50:30] <+MoroseLoki> Harvest Moon looks weird
[3:50:30] <FuumetsuKuroi> TLOU2 lol
[3:50:31] <+MooseIsGoose> Hades is the game that people will play after this year

[3:50:38] <%jillpilled> SAVE US AC
[3:50:38] <%T_Sasquatch> ANYONE BUT THE LAST OF US 2
[3:50:39] <+Scevda> Hades actually a development that was caring.
[3:50:40] <+gutlesscoward> acnh should take it but it wont
[3:50:40] <$NitronStreams> Doom and Animal Crossing should both win to complete the meme
[3:50:40] <bettysharkface> Fuck, it's gonna be tough
[3:50:41] <+half_awake1> Hades should win, but itll be Last of Us
[3:50:41] <+Walopoh> I will be happy if anything beats TLOU
[3:50:42] <s1rcuit> I hate that the TLOU2 is gonna get game of the year
[3:50:42] <gregpivo> Hades is too fun. Games shouldn't be fun
[3:50:42] <$TenderBabyBacon> Yakuza is almost too new for GOTY, Rose tinted glasses and all
[3:50:43] <PartyFavors> Hades is better than Doom.
[3:50:43] <SolGainer> This game was comfy for a while, but It wasn't my thing
[3:50:43] <+darudeampersandstorm> Hades and Tsushima are 100% undeserving tbh
[3:50:43] <%Oncamimus> so cute though XD
[3:50:43] <%jillpilled> JUST NOT TLOU2

[3:57:55] <%Idziman> Yakuza on PC
[3:57:55] <trianglehat> best erection
[3:57:55] <+SoySocks> Back 4 Blood looked great
[3:57:55] <+Novadirge> Novadirge subscribed with Prime. 
[3:57:56] <tanarath> Devolver, though
[3:57:56] <%BoxNavy> ALYX SHOULD HAVE WON
[3:57:56] <+Izzzyko> elden ring trailer in febuary
[3:57:56] <%Captainahab_37> ooooooooh vaporware
[3:57:57] <+Grayhammatter> chef was cool
[3:57:57] <+DazedCookies> Last of Us 2 winning every award it was nominated for
[3:57:58] <+PatchworkSquid> lack of elden ring and metal gear
[3:57:59] <DisneylandPimp> Cowdoy
[3:57:59] <JackaxeAM> paige
[3:58:00] <Jaller101514> lou2 shouldnt have won
[3:58:01] <%Sotetsu> Award shows are dumb in general
[3:58:01] <danielm427> CK3 was rob
[3:58:01] <dots4eyes> Best erection
[3:58:02] <ShadeTheNovice> best erection
[3:58:03] <+victhebeard> 100% Pat is right
[3:58:04] <%Alazull> Best Direction is second place
[3:58:05] <+necrocannibal2> I AGREE
[3:58:06] <Shishi1205> is for second running best game
[3:58:06] <%Indigo_Automaton> ALYX WAS ROBBED
[3:58:07] <tattleworm> it's the yoko taro award
[3:58:07] <%DiscoMatador> I want to see Paige talk about Race politics
[3:58:08] <%Promessa_EX> should be the actual director in the game's story
[3:58:08] <+darudeampersandstorm> it goes to the game's director
[3:58:09] <PettyFunk> Best RPG should ABSOLUTELY have gone to Yakuza
[3:58:09] <%HiroTSK5> Game of the Year 2nd place
[3:58:09] <critiquequartz> Yeah
[3:58:09] <+MarkRJR> If it was Art Direction I'd get it, but "direction" is super vague
[3:58:10] <Pompadourius> Yeah, for sure
[3:58:11] <+Walopoh> TRUE
[3:58:11] <twistedj3ster> The awards don't matter, Hades was still good
[3:58:12] <ammobasket> Low point: feeling like muting needs to happen
[3:58:12] <EbilWulf> the awards was the worst part
[3:58:13] <HayabusaTaichou> the game awards have always been a joke
[3:58:13] <lotharrio> Historically, best director goes hand in hand with best picture. As for games, dunno.
[3:58:13] <%caramelatte1> Yeah
[3:58:14] <+filledusoleil> should have been Hades
[3:58:14] <+Piemen99> biggest erection
[3:58:14] <+dave323dave> it is really reductive to attribute the quality of a game to a single person
[3:58:15] <%Monkeyweed21> pretty much
[3:58:15] <k_af> Yeah I don't know what that means
[3:58:15] <%ennui_on_me> Oscar for Best Director is often the Best Picture winner too
[3:58:16] <FlamingoJazz> Best Direction is inseparable from just "Good game"
[3:58:17] <srkAres> LoU2 won because a lot of people played it and only that, so a lot of people voted for it
[3:58:18] <$Solidnick18> but they double won it
[3:58:18] <AnacondaVirtue> No, you're just crazy.
[3:58:19] <Kingtweedy> the game awards dont matter, theyre like the oscars lol
[3:58:19] <cipher758> pat's feet
[3:58:19] <bob900000> God of war won both in 2018
[3:58:19] <leinadtonu> let it go Pat, the jerk won... as always....
[3:58:19] <%AlphaTauri> its fucked up it went to a game with that kind of crunch and pressure on the staff
[3:58:20] <%T_Sasquatch> STOP SHOWING YOUR FEET PAT
[3:58:20] <jorniev> GAME DIRECTION
[3:58:21] <$Sphincter_Spelunker> (X) Doubt
[3:58:21] <%SvenHolgersson> Most of those categories are bullshit like most awards
[3:58:22] <someonionbro> Doom got robbed
[3:58:22] <%Admiral_PopnFresh> Always
[3:58:23] <%BinaryFireball> It has to be always different or always the same
[3:58:24] <dabeaminator> It's the "we can't stop comparing ourselves to movies" award.
[3:58:24] <%DiscoMatador> YEP
[3:58:25] <%shi013> i see it as "best director"
[3:58:26] <%BinaryFireball> by definition
[3:58:26] <+ThreeStrikes_> Pat you're caring too much about a popular contest littered in ads
[3:58:29] <DR_AWESOME99> my gonherria wont let me win that award :(
[3:58:30] <+dashdodger> its bullshit
[3:58:31] <eco419> LUL
[3:58:31] <goroke> Geoff got on stage and just started SUCKING NAUGHTY DOG ON STAGE LIVE was my favorite part
[3:58:31] <%Sotetsu> Pat proudly points the way forward in his field
[3:58:31] <Blank9> and it wasn't the best choice for EITHER
[3:58:31] <nivlac_555> If that's the intent for the award, then it is weird
[3:58:32] <I_OneGuy_Over_Heaven_I> True, but they're all just excuses for studios to jerk each other off
[3:58:32] <%trustycoyote> What direction does LoU2 have?
[3:58:33] <ShadeTheNovice> you are correct pat
[3:58:33] <+scottysunday> I'm just so shocked that HADES didn't get more love.
[3:58:35] <+warlockwithapixie> but you came up with that tho
[3:58:36] <+loukemia83> it was the Kojima award last year
[3:58:36] <bettysharkface> Yeah I'm pissed off Hades should have had it
[3:58:37] <jumpyhugs> I think BOTW did that too
[3:58:37] <+PipIV> Kinda weird erection?
[3:58:38] <coreyyotto> Fuck I liked TLOU2 and I don't think it should have gotten that many awards
[3:58:38] <thebalticguy1> ehhhhhhhh
[3:58:38] <Emperor_Machinus> it was a bad direction though...
[3:58:38] <%blue8moon> But Hades though
[3:58:38] <+Rofiarf> Best direction just means like how many hollywood cutscenes are there.
[3:58:39] <EMP_SoloSagat> Doom got robbed
[3:58:39] <kick13_> it's like dmc5 winning best action game over sekiro, so it automatically makes it better
[3:58:39] <Jontman42> It's more like a "do you know who the director of the game is" award
[3:58:39] <GearVoltron> What direction does your schlong curve pat
[3:58:40] <+Scevda> Best Direction: Best Leadership- AKA Supergiant.
[3:58:40] <+GingerStrawhat> I interpret it to be the guy who ran the studio best towards a finished product. Like Hades or Ghosts should have gotten that in spades
[3:58:40] <%ItsYaGirlMaria> it feels like people didnt like TLOU2, Im surprised it got so far
[3:58:40] <%TCDerps> Didn't God of War win both Direction and GOTY?
[3:58:41] <PettyFunk> Especially because direction was one of the things TLOU2 was SORELY lacking in
[3:58:41] <+LacarisBarber> Clubhouse games ROBBED
[3:58:42] <+BloodyBurney> Best Direction, as interpreted as "Most Innovating/Genre-Pushing" is my go-to
[3:58:42] <Cjjb1995> Pat, the awards part of the game awards are such a clear afterthought that I think it's futile getting mad at this.
[3:58:42] <+Walopoh> DOOM Eternal won NOTHING
[3:58:43] <peachy996> It's really innovative to crunch your team
[3:58:43] <Nupinoop296> innovating new ways to crunch
[3:58:43] <%BoxNavy> alyx was the most innovative game on that list for the liquid physics alone
[3:58:44] <DaHaLoJeDi> It is literally all bullshit to give TLOU2 more awards
[3:58:44] <+bairros> They innovated in the how much they crunched
[3:58:45] <%hrbeck_> Sony funds this shit
[3:58:45] <%Monkeyweed21> NO WE NEED TO FELLATE THE CRUNCHMAN HARDER
[3:58:46] <aero160h> they're arbitrary
[3:58:46] <+Kingtut9009> Wait is it over mwith no Elden Ring?
[3:58:48] <+AnIcedCoffee> Best Direction is just for sucking off the Director specifically
[3:58:48] <$ItsRatman> But every dog has a name!
[3:58:50] <+theComradGeneral> it innovated on crunch
[3:58:51] <$Sphincter_Spelunker> innovative crunch
[3:58:52] <Awkward_Internet_User> I fucking love Paige's reactions 🤣 😂 😭
[3:58:52] <+Amakuni1> Theyre just blindly following the oscars with that category
[3:58:52] <SolGainer> Western Media sucks off TLOU2 so hard
[3:58:53] <josemoya95> For example one the oscars almost no film has ever won best picture withput best direction
[3:58:54] <+PleasantLee> welcome to the video game oscars, Pat
[3:58:55] <+darudeampersandstorm> TLoU2 blew all of the other picks out of the water, Pat. are you out of your mind
[3:58:56] <+Ipsenscastle> It made me mad
[3:58:56] <%Promessa_EX> right and they had the accessibility reward
[3:58:58] <+SunnyVarietyPack> "MM NEIL YOU HAVE SUCH A TASTY COCK LET ME SUCK IT"
[3:58:58] <%Admiral_PopnFresh> TLOU 2 wasn't even that good. It was OK
[3:58:58] <%ennui_on_me> Last of Us 2 is the worst directed, because of all the crunch, which is inherently bad direction
[3:58:58] <critiquequartz> Tbh they really should just be relying on community votes NOT critics because what even is video game critica
[3:58:59] <+Chester_goes_Berserk> Doom Eternal got NOTHING
[3:58:59] <Tha_Mik> It was the one that paid the most
[3:59:00] <+dashdodger> like who cares its just a game award, but man Ghosts got done dirty
[3:59:00] <HayabusaTaichou> new innovations in CRUNCH.
[3:59:01] <DR_AWESOME99> the game awards staring the last of us part 2
[3:59:01] <%YaBoiShamoi> Sony Money is Big
[3:59:02] <Gallhint> Best direction should be for the game that went above and beyond prior expectations
[3:59:02] <$Solidnick18> well we all know they buy there way into these so whatever
[3:59:03] <+BurncoatRapscallion> GIEF
[3:59:05] <ullyzeez> whats your game of the year pat? paige?
[3:59:06] <Discount_CJ> I'm so saddened by all of this
[3:59:07] <%UlriktheSlayer1> last of us 2 is literally last of us 1 but worse
[3:59:08] <JohnJackJohnson> I missed it did they have any interest in the league rpg because that writing deserves better than the shithole main game and it looked pretty cool
[3:59:08] <$LeRouch_the_Rebel> It was innovative becuase it had trans gays Kappa
[3:59:10] <+necrocannibal2> GAMEPLAY-WISE TLOU2 IS JUST THE SAME AS THE FIRST ONE. LITERALLY NO DIFFERENCE AT ALL.
[3:59:11] <Sporkgasm> but then basically no games would get awards
[3:59:11] <Tennochief> it did not deserve the rewards it got, except for the accessibility one
[3:59:12] <ItYaboiDrew> Animal Crossing New Horizons was innovated
[3:59:13] <+Walopoh> So many games didn't win anything, just so TLOU2 could sweep
[3:59:13] <tanarath> You shouldn't
[3:59:13] <%trustycoyote> just reinforced the crunch mentality
[3:59:14] <+Scevda> Iterative not innovative ya.
[3:59:14] <coreyyotto> But then you wouldn't be able to give anyt awards
[3:59:15] <DianaTheAscian> CRUNCH WINS
[3:59:15] <flatcapgame> NO AWARDS FOR CRUNCH
[3:59:17] <+loukemia83> like imagine if Hollywood just used Slaves instead of rich people
[3:59:17] <%BoxNavy> pat fuckin play half life alyx already
[3:59:18] <gregpivo> Ehh TLOU2 innovated a lot with different accessibility settings. Especially looking at Cyberpunk giving people siezures
[3:59:18] <+gustavozxd> eh that's a different argument I feel
[3:59:19] <%TheLemuroid> But that's all of rhem
[3:59:21] <%hrbeck_> they crunched them the best
[3:59:21] <%optimasmaximas> LUL
[3:59:21] <trianglehat> acceptable
[3:59:22] <JonnyJug> Have they released sales number after the first month?
[3:59:23] <zmuno> Just to sell TLOS2 Game of the Year Edition
[3:59:23] <leinadtonu> Assholes tend to win, that's how it is...
[3:59:24] <+strakillias> It was probably more inventive than animal crossing but thats it
[3:59:24] <digaogrunge> Dont they get judges to choose for Best Direction and public vote for Best Game?
[3:59:24] <super_robo_mg> I already do that
[3:59:25] <AGRO_91> "how will we top TLOU2? crunch harder!"
[3:59:25] <%Promessa_EX> well we do that anyway
[3:59:25] <+ThreeStrikes_> Wouldn't Alyx be the most innovative since no one else made a VR game?
[3:59:26] <%SirGO0SE> when I hear direction I expect an award for the game with the best cutscenes tbh
[3:59:26] <+justianxix> Especially when you talk about studios, I dont think Naughty Dog deserve it
[3:59:26] <Emperor_Machinus> bonus
[3:59:28] <%Chatterbox1991> Mafia Remake got nothing and that's BULLSHIT
[3:59:28] <%Jack_of_No_Trades> But then almost no triple a games would be eligible.
[3:59:30] <Ynkubus_> They should be Hall of Shame'd
[3:59:30] <+victhebeard> but Pat they had a 2 main female characters. and the gay
[3:59:32] <%cylish> I wonder what would happen if they just came out and said crunch means your game doesnt get on any list
[3:59:33] <%Monkeyweed21> reminder that Supergiant are hard anti-crunch
[3:59:33] <+MillerLowlife> thats already reality
[3:59:34] <%T_Sasquatch> You mean what they do already LUL
[3:59:34] <%Alazull> That was some horseshit
[3:59:34] <+polothegreatest> its ps money, pat
[3:59:37] <SidneyJKs> PridePaint you know why they win RPGPhatLoot
[3:59:39] <+michingmallecho> Well then like 95 percent of studios can’t be nominated
[3:59:40] <Tomschiii> well, i dont really care about the backround, only the product
[3:59:40] <PettyFunk> Yakuza 7 deserved something.
[3:59:41] <boomstickery> it sucks
[3:59:42] <$Solidnick18> what a bummer
[3:59:43] <+RhiasX> I mean, you joke, but who do you think mines the lithum for those iphones?
[3:59:43] <GearVoltron> The crunch gives a boost to award possibility
[3:59:45] <coreyyotto> Crunch is an industry standard, Naughty Dog was just the most high profile
[3:59:47] <OneThousandTomatoes> agreed
[3:59:48] <qu3kl41n_the_impure_king> the people who like it have shit taste
[3:59:49] <%Alazull> TLOU2 was so uninspired
[3:59:49] <%JusTTheGuyYouNeed> ARE YOU READY FOR CYBERPUNK TO WIN NEXT YEAR
[3:59:51] <%aishman> @peachsaliva Its a crime Hades only won one award
[3:59:51] <Sporkgasm> it's such a bland game
[3:59:53] <+Chester_goes_Berserk> I love consoles being made by Uighur slaves
[3:59:53] <+GingerStrawhat> I'm a big defender of this show so often, but this year really sucked
[3:59:55] <josemoya95> Where has that ever stop anyone about anythings?
[3:59:56] <%TheLemuroid> Hades got robbed
[3:59:59] <DianaTheAscian> its so boring
[4:00:00] <TheNewJapanGuy> TLOU2 was mediocre
[4:00:01] <Dhurkst> Quality of product is quality of product. Completely separate from crunch, though crunch sucks
[4:00:01] <dabeaminator> That's because it's bad
[4:00:03] <$Sphincter_Spelunker> Should have came out 5 years ago
[4:00:05] <%UlriktheSlayer1> DOOM GOT ROBBED
[4:00:06] <+twistingt0rt0ise> Hades was locally sourced and crunch free.
[4:00:06] <pikapie> hades won 2 didnt it
[4:00:06] <DaHaLoJeDi> by that metric the winners would only be Supergiant Games and WE CAN'T HAVE THAT
[4:00:07] <StrangeLace> the fact that Hades only won one award is damn crime
[4:00:08] <%BoxNavy> hades alyx and yakuza got robbed hard
[4:00:08] <%mike2hands> win 2 awards
[4:00:08] <%thechodericky> Hades is such a good game too
[4:00:09] <%HiroTSK5> 13 Sentinels Got Robbed
[4:00:10] <%medusasghost> no they won 2
[4:00:11] <+Walopoh> If Nolan lied about the winner for GOTY it would've been based af.
[4:00:11] <Jaller101514> Hades wo n 2
[4:00:11] <Billli11> I think HADES hot 2
[4:00:12] <+darudeampersandstorm> TLoU2 is an 8/10 but it's still my GOTY. bad year for games
[4:00:13] <%ItsYaGirlMaria> Hades won Action and Indie but Indie doesnt really count
[4:00:14] <%caramelatte1> FF14 got nothing again
[4:00:14] <dredshift> Hades got 2, Indie and Action
[4:00:14] <gregpivo> I don't understand people who are super passionate about TLOU2, but I think it's fine
[4:00:14] <+Ipsenscastle> Hades was robbed for real
[4:00:14] <%baronblank> doom also didn't win anything I don't think
[4:00:15] <itsthelos> Not enough people played Hades than those Last of Us 2
[4:00:16] <CataractCat> Who won goty, I had to dip out at a bad time :((
[4:00:16] <+worldbrand> im not surprised whatsoever
[4:00:16] <%SvenHolgersson> hehe blunt
[4:00:16] <%Promessa_EX> no mention of vtubers
[4:00:17] <iosephe> Yakuza came out super late to be fair, but still
[4:00:17] <+cvp5127> aegis rim was robbed
[4:00:17] <+seoliart> Hades won two I think
[4:00:17] <pompous_ostrich> one nom but it was goty, which is weird
[4:00:18] <%Aztec50> Did Ghost of Tsushima get anything?
[4:00:18] <ullyzeez> ya'll motherfuckers done deserve Ichiban
[4:00:19] <critiquequartz> IT WAS THE SAME GAME FOR EACH AWARD
[4:00:19] <+pectusumbra> Let's be real, how many journos actually fucking played enough Hades to get the good shit
[4:00:20] <Blank9> Ghost of Tsushima should've been the "safe" pick, I can't believe TLOU2 got both.
[4:00:20] <+gustavozxd> 'ive seen so many people who love tlou2 more than Woolie loves punch girls
[4:00:21] <Shishi1205> ye
[4:00:24] <+necrocannibal2> TRUE
[4:00:24] <eco419> A lot of people on the chat was BOOing everything TLOU2
[4:00:25] <aero160h> lou2 was a bland, boring pile of crap
[4:00:25] <tattleworm> japanese games don't count
[4:00:25] <bob900000> spiderman didn't get anything
[4:00:25] <%Monkeyweed21> There are plenty of good things in TLOU2 but its all dragged down by pacing and story
[4:00:26] <Tampaoster> did No mans sky won anything?
[4:00:27] <%Promessa_EX> yes
[4:00:28] <%medusasghost> YUP
[4:00:29] <alrobot2014> kinda surprised Ghost of Tsushima didn't get jack shit
[4:00:29] <%ThomasOfTroy> P5 Royal had one nomination and that was ridiculous
[4:00:30] <+ThreeStrikes_> Game Awards has always snubbed Eastern devs
[4:00:30] <+ChestMimik> What a mystery
[4:00:30] <+sewermonk> 13 sentinels didnt get the writing award too sadly
[4:00:31] <%jillpilled> Yeahhh
[4:00:32] <rosemon5001> doom soundtrack was just spacebar pushing
[4:00:33] <%kewlmyc> Sekiro won last year
[4:00:34] <%ItsYaGirlMaria> AT THE VERY LEAST I'm glad 13 Sentinels got up there
[4:00:34] <+penjaza> 13 Sentinels was robbed
[4:00:34] <+boomstarprime> ghost of tsushima basically robbed
[4:00:34] <+lil_pudintater9> 13 sentinels is the biggest robbery of the year
[4:00:35] <digitalslime> it was rather late in the year as well
[4:00:35] <%Kenzo2000> Dude, kojima took evrything last year
[4:00:35] <+PipIV> Favoritism
[4:00:36] <DianaTheAscian> yeah...
[4:00:36] <$Solidnick18> i mean sekiro won and that's about it
[4:00:36] <Gallhint> What era was that?
[4:00:37] <+GingerStrawhat> The Last of Us 2 swept it's awards, and in a year with so many good games. That should be fucking impossible
[4:00:37] <+Tyonidus> JAPANESE VIDEO GAMES ARE LITERALLY THE BEST GAMES EVER REEEEEEEEEE
[4:00:37] <SolGainer> THEY WON'T BACK DOWN
[4:00:37] <%Promessa_EX> i don't count sekiro
[4:00:38] <$Sphincter_Spelunker> Sekiro won last year. What are you on about
[4:00:40] <+Scevda> Hades: Treat people and do new things well. Always fucked.
[4:00:42] <Nupinoop296> UGGGGHHHHHHHH
[4:00:45] <Bigbauerboss> Sekiro won goty last year
[4:00:46] <PettyFunk> I mean FFVII won for RPG but that should have gone to Yakuzies anyway
[4:00:48] <peachy996> I sure can't wait to see Bioware deal with the massive corner they wrot themselves in. A Corner they had to change universes to escape from
[4:00:49] <+Bootybunns> r/eldenring is fucking dying
[4:00:53] <%KeiganOfAstora> dark souls?
[4:00:53] <%hrbeck_> and sekiro didnt need to win last year
[4:00:56] <+Ipsenscastle> don't remind me, that was a horrible time
[4:00:56] <Sporkgasm> art
[4:00:58] <KikioJane> Yikes
[4:00:58] <@commanderclaw> It's some racism people won't admit to
[4:00:59] <%BoxNavy> players choice
[4:00:59] <%Chatterbox1991> Last of Us suffers from being mediocore combined with the authors being pretentious pieces of shit
[4:01:00] <%cylish> Xenophobia for everyone!
[4:01:00] <+Frost_Quill> @PeachSaliva VGAs are no longer relevant, they're just for trailers now.
[4:01:00] <+Rekinsinn> is pat referring to that john fish quote
[4:01:01] <Jrocy247> Just Art......LUL
[4:01:02] <itsthelos> Also Last of Us 2 fans push hard on voting
[4:01:02] <+Invlux> Player's Choice
[4:01:03] <%TheLemuroid> Art
[4:01:03] <%Admiral_PopnFresh> Players Choise
[4:01:03] <SomeSageAdvice> yes art
[4:01:03] <silver__viii> Art and Players Choice iirc
[4:01:04] <RazCipher_ff> Player's choice
[4:01:04] <reonome> who won narrative?
[4:01:05] <Dhurkst> the mid-2000s?
[4:01:05] <%he1lhydra> best action right?
[4:01:05] <Cigwynn> Community vote
[4:01:05] <CappuccinoGuil> Ghost was Player's choice
[4:01:06] <Billli11> art and player vote
[4:01:07] <dragonairbnb> And voice
[4:01:07] <iteruq> sekiro won so they have to western supremacy this year
[4:01:07] <+boomstarprime> sekiro was goty last year
[4:01:07] <%legendfather_of_giants> @PeachSaliva and player'
[4:01:07] <%BoxNavy> it did not win art direction
[4:01:07] <bettysharkface> Hades got 2 awards, but they deserve so many more
[4:01:08] <%Idziman> Player's Choice
[4:01:08] <Shishi1205> maybe Mh world winning some awards
[4:01:08] <%ItsYaGirlMaria> SEKIRO WAS LAST YEAR?????
[4:01:08] <OneThousandTomatoes> ghost of tsushima is made by westerners
[4:01:09] <%shi013> an people's choice
[4:01:10] <+filledusoleil> best art...
[4:01:11] <+AnIcedCoffee> A western studio that needed help from the JAPANESE Director of 3 and 4 LUL
[4:01:11] <%Promessa_EX> ghost is a western game anyway
[4:01:11] <+Peculiaryordle> Hades won NOTHING such robery.
[4:01:12] <+necrocannibal2> GHOST OF TSUSHIMA IS OVERRATED AS FUCK
[4:01:12] <DaHaLoJeDi> OOF
[4:01:12] <PhilJoeO> There was that year BotW, Mario, Yakuza O and P5 were all up for game of the year
[4:01:13] <Prevot> ghost won the popular vote
[4:01:13] <+michingmallecho> Bunch of racists, holding down Dante
[4:01:17] <%BoxNavy> or did it idk i been drinking
[4:01:19] <PettyFunk> Ghost of Tsushima is from Seattle isn't it
[4:01:19] <Darren716> Because no one played Aegis
[4:01:21] <GearVoltron> Ghost of tsukihime
[4:01:21] <%Alazull> checkmate
[4:01:22] <+Scevda> Players voice
[4:01:23] <%legendfather_of_giants> and player's choice, which was TEN PERCENT of GOTY @PeachSaliva
[4:01:24] <+darudeampersandstorm> TLoU2's story blows it out of the water tbh
[4:01:25] <+BigCoffee> Pat did you even finish Aegis Rim?
[4:01:27] <ShadeTheNovice> aegis was robbed hard
[4:01:28] <$Solidnick18> aegis rim should have won that yeah
[4:01:28] <+ItsFeztho> I liked it when the Among Us Devs started tearing up for winning, it felt really sweet, I'm really happy for them
[4:01:28] <rosemon5001> @Bootybunns at this rate elder scrolls 6 will come out before it
[4:01:28] <%SvenHolgersson> BAD PAT
[4:01:29] <+KawaiiJetty> Every year there are bad award choices.
[4:01:29] <coreyyotto> yeah good job pat
[4:01:29] <%HiroTSK5> 13 Sentinels wasn't even nominated for music
[4:01:30] <%Admiral_PopnFresh> Aegis Rim is So Good
[4:01:30] <leinadtonu> THE PAT SHOW!!!
[4:01:31] <+cvp5127> tsushima is a wastern game
[4:01:32] <$Draylle> wait that shit won best narrative ?!
[4:01:33] <bob900000> I thought you didn't finish it?
[4:01:34] <%YaBoiShamoi> @PeachSaliva Ghost isnt a japanese made game
[4:01:34] <+Grayhammatter> aegis got robbed
[4:01:35] <%DiaborosYuzuha> DiaborosYuzuha subscribed with Prime. 
[4:01:36] <+GingerStrawhat> I like The Last of Us 2 but I don't like it more then Ghosts, Hades, 13 Sentinels or Yakuza and many others
[4:01:36] <%T_Sasquatch> to be honest LUL
[4:01:37] <+ThreeStrikes_> You expect western old guys to play a Visual Novel
[4:01:37] <Coystick> I liek your shirt Peach
[4:01:38] <+Ipsenscastle> Pat was 100% correct though
[4:01:40] <NaturalGear> it's a popularity contest, like Oscars
[4:01:40] <k_af> shhh the man is speaking Kappa
[4:01:40] <+FlubbedPig> I'm assuming that none of the judges played 13 Sentinels and it was only nominated 'cause they heard it was good.
[4:01:41] <+PipIV> Narrative: Revenge, vvomen
[4:01:41] <%Admiral_PopnFresh> Pouty Pat
[4:01:42] <DaHaLoJeDi> That was the "Sorry about Bloodborne" award though
[4:01:43] <eco419> True
[4:01:43] <%BoxNavy> no one played 13 sentinels no chance it would win
[4:01:46] <+BoboDaHobo> ironic considering tsushima had no art direction
[4:01:47] <linSP> JUST ass
[4:01:50] <$RetroCop87> We'd listen to Paige more if she wasn't wearing that MAGA hat /s
[4:01:50] <Darren716> The ads are the best part
[4:01:50] <Ultimatefool> Yakuza robbed Hades robbed 13 sentinels Robbed
[4:01:51] <pompous_ostrich> overt?
[4:01:52] <Aydarkzero> it's always been ads
[4:01:52] <baronvonkame> The podcast this next week will be spicy
[4:01:53] <+SoySocks> paige wants subtle ads
[4:01:53] <+UberWolfman> WE NEED MONEY!!!! MMMMMMMMMMMMMM
[4:01:54] <%kewlmyc> Aegis Rim was robbed, but no one played it, so it was expected.
[4:01:54] <Cherokia666> I liked the ads better than the actual show, tbh
[4:01:54] <himbearbedtime> Aegis is way more popular in Japan, I think
[4:01:57] <Sowlith> the awards are the side show to the ads though
[4:01:58] <+thepalestachegamer> thepalestachegamer subscribed with Prime. 
[4:01:59] <$GarbageNirvana> If nothing else the fact that Hades showed up as a GOTY contender at all was something
[4:01:59] <DianaTheAscian> this was the most blatant
[4:01:59] <xxshadowxx416> it e3 but less fun
[4:02:01] <srkAres> i wish they wouldnt have hurried through some of the awards so quickly
[4:02:01] <+Arxel1> THE PEOPLES VOTE
[4:02:02] <+HyperCharge_Sam> Wear a suit and make it more classy
[4:02:02] <$Draylle> right in your face? @PeachSaliva
[4:02:03] <TheNewJapanGuy> The Show was an add
[4:02:03] <%SirGO0SE> you watch ADs to see them award ADs
[4:02:03] <Kingtweedy> i feel like the ads werent nearly as bad this year
[4:02:04] <+NoCreditClear> it's only gotten worse with no live audience.
[4:02:04] <dredshift> The one I'm baffled by is Audio Direction. How did LoU2 beat DOOM?
[4:02:06] <digaogrunge> But the ads were bad

[4:02:07] <BonesandMuses> @PeachSaliva arennt these awards bought the same way oscars and other awards are? games are bigger than hollywood so i dont think it would be any different
[4:02:07] <Explodincatz> donate your DNA for the product master buy
[4:02:07] <+GingerStrawhat> Last year it wasn't that bad, like I don't know what the fuck happened this year.
[4:02:08] <+ChestMimik> They could hide it by Geoff not showng contempt for their own clips
[4:02:10] <DayDayMaccin1> Actual Garbage won GOTY....
[4:02:11] <dabeaminator> Geoff desperately wants us to know which celebrities he's friends with. That's the show.
[4:02:12] <Dondont> it was a big Microsoft add
[4:02:13] <%BoxNavy> yes
[4:02:13] <AMajorTom> Incoming pouting Pat bit
[4:02:15] <%Jack_of_No_Trades> I love that bot
[4:02:15] <+darudeampersandstorm> @dredshift because it's better
[4:02:16] <%Kenzo2000> Remember when Geoff stared into the camera and read an ad for an SSD
[4:02:16] <$NitronStreams> just make it e3
[4:02:17] <GearVoltron> At least be blatant like devolver
[4:02:17] <$Gr4ndm4rsh4ll> It's basically just E3 with participation trophies now
[4:02:17] <DanThePumpkinman> The fact that naughty dog will use this an an excuse to just crunch even harder on their next game pisses me off.
[4:02:18] <+loukemia83> It would be less obvious if the same 5 games weren't nominated in every category
[4:02:18] <+Walopoh> We were about 9 trailers in a row when I could remember the last award being given
[4:02:19] <Shishi1205> sure
[4:02:19] <+Grayhammatter> LUL
[4:02:19] <linSP> GIVE SHICK HYDROBOT
[4:02:19] <Qsmash_> Hydrobot, that was sick!
[4:02:21] <R3Roundabout> I don't care about the awards, just release the trailers in a playlist and get it over with
[4:02:21] <boomstickery> its the bare minimum to hold attention
[4:02:22] <DjFrostBite95> LUL
[4:02:22] <ShadeTheNovice> LUL
[4:02:23] <+chicken_danger> geoff in a cup noodles costume

[4:02:24] <%jillpilled> YEYEYE
[4:02:26] <%trustycoyote> That's why I love Devolver stuff
[4:02:26] <simifu> I got my news at the beginning with smash so I got my high
[4:02:29] <leinadtonu> It should promote the fucking hobby not aspire to be movies.
[4:02:29] <%cylish> Death stranding style product placement
[4:02:29] <buerdo> Mh rise trailer was cool
[4:02:29] <$Sphincter_Spelunker> Cup o Noodles
[4:02:30] <+BoboDaHobo> I liked the gamer cum ad
[4:02:30] <k_af> Award show themselves are stupid, I just watch this for the trailers
[4:02:32] <Aleate> Hey guys, wanna play Valorant? :)
[4:02:33] <itsthelos> Every award shows have commercials and this is at least tied to the show
[4:02:33] <+Rofiarf> I wish it wasn't a popularity contest among game journalists.
[4:02:33] <+necrocannibal2> I WANT THAT BIG BRAZILIAN ROBOT THAT DANCES
[4:02:33] <tattleworm> instead it's facebook presents mental health which is just insidious
[4:02:34] <Kingtweedy> but then again i was ignoring most of it
[4:02:34] <fuchard1996> PEPSIMAAAAN
[4:02:34] <%Kirby_Sauce> Cheer200 Where's the award for best cup noodle game?
[4:02:34] <+ThreeStrikes_> No plague, just an actual gun
[4:02:35] <+vG_Chance> i dont watch the awards anymore, i just watch people watch it. does that make sense xD.

[4:02:37] <$Audega> Audega subscribed with Prime. 
[4:02:38] <$RetroCop87> Man, remember the "Make 7-up yours" campaign?
[4:02:38] <iteruq> devolver style ads
[4:02:39] <%T_Sasquatch> Aegis rim is a 60 dollar visual novel. what the fuck do you guys expect
[4:02:39] <himbearbedtime> Gendo Ikari razor commercial
[4:02:41] <SonicD4> woolie yelling at us to shave our balls
[4:02:42] <%BinaryFireball> Did you checkout the jury list?
[4:02:42] <dots4eyes> Pepsiman yeyeye
[4:02:42] <$mister___doctor> Hide your Capitalism better
[4:02:44] <PettyFunk> I want Kojima to wrestle the camera out of the cameraman's hands to zoom in on his designer belt buckle
[4:02:44] <%Garthunox> the best part was the Devolver bit
[4:02:44] <%caramelatte1> Devolver Digital was the best part.
[4:02:46] <shiny_prinny> Nioh 2 was nominated for best action and that was cool but I agree with the Hades pick
[4:02:48] <+dave323dave> its such a different energy than E3
[4:02:48] <%W1nterTitan> but now you can buy like a dragon cheaper
[4:02:48] <Dhurkst> Pull a FF15 Cup Noodles thing
[4:02:49] <+TungstenViper> these TGAs are a joke KEKW
[4:02:49] <+GingerStrawhat> Or do away with the Trailers
[4:02:50] <+Walopoh> E3 2
[4:02:50] <linSP> I miss crowbcat compilations bros
[4:02:50] <%BoxNavy> yeah
[4:02:51] <andresisant> Thanks for the 2020Unroll @audega
[4:02:52] <reonome> i agree
[4:02:53] <Scorian> awards suck
[4:02:53] <Discount_CJ> yeah
[4:02:55] <astrophizz> it's even more of an industry promotion than other awards shows
[4:02:56] <%T_Sasquatch> its literally just E3 2
[4:02:57] <%KeiganOfAstora> What if it was the Video Game Trailer Show
[4:02:57] <Shwepie> You mean E3?
[4:02:57] <dabeaminator> Geoff wants the prestige
[4:02:58] <+toastybites> that's just E3
[4:02:58] <coreyyotto> The awards seem like the lowest effort part of it
[4:03:00] <TynanWuff> they could lube us up before they fuck us, ya know
[4:03:00] <%cylish> thats E3
[4:03:00] <+loukemia83> Geoff's own personal E3
[4:03:02] <VJdarkworld> thats what nintendo directs are right
[4:03:02] <auraofdawn> wasnt psx an attempt at that
[4:03:03] <+FlubbedPig> Make a fucking ad where Ellie talks about how much she loves Cup Noodles like Gladiolus
[4:03:03] <josemoya95> This was way to fucking long
[4:03:03] <%BoxNavy> the awards are filler EleGiggle
[4:03:03] <OneThousandTomatoes> but then its not "special"
[4:03:04] <$Solidnick18> i'd be down if it was non stop trailers and that's it
[4:03:06] <kayamek> E4
[4:03:06] <DayDayMaccin1> It Is
[4:03:06] <Nupinoop296> i am
[4:03:07] <Sporkgasm> it is
[4:03:08] <simifu> pat it LUL
[4:03:08] <$rdark_ksu> ill say that
[4:03:08] <+chicken_danger> sephroth was the best part and i dont even own a switch
[4:03:09] <+xeros720> paige describing this stream
[4:03:09] <k_af> Paige is 100% right
[4:03:09] <%cylish> I AM GAME BAD
[4:03:10] <+lethallylactic> (It is)
[4:03:11] <+Lolo27234> real game of the year 2020 was risk of rain 2
[4:03:11] <+Delenay> its the pretense
[4:03:12] <%Kirby_Sauce> I am
[4:03:12] <%caramelatte1> But its bad
[4:03:13] <ullyzeez> its fine you can say it
[4:03:14] <+PipIV> FUCK NO
[4:03:15] <DianaTheAscian> which it is
[4:03:15] <%KeiganOfAstora> no
[4:03:16] <laserbeaming> but how will Neil Druckmann get his ego stroked?
[4:03:16] <Gallhint> The fucking voice of Joel introduced a segment like COME ON
[4:03:17] <boomstickery> no 100% no
[4:03:17] <+DefiniteRobot> I'll say the last of us 2 is bad
[4:03:17] <Omega_Keiichi> I mean they seem to not care about a lot of awards. Remember how they listed off 5 awards twice in a row?
[4:03:18] <%UlriktheSlayer1> noo
[4:03:18] <Zalthia> It feels. Icky. The whole thing feels icky. I want to be hyped but I cant.
[4:03:18] <ShadeTheNovice> no
[4:03:18] <%Promessa_EX> the community awards were the worst part
[4:03:18] <+Mendin> Paige is frantically trying to write the script as she reads it
[4:03:22] <itsthelos> The Awards are the same as other Award Shows
[4:03:22] <%KeiganOfAstora> not really
[4:03:24] <+justianxix> The whole show is made under the pretense of a Award show
[4:03:25] <%BoxNavy> IT BEAT ALYX FOR INNOVATION THATS SO RIDICULOUS
[4:03:25] <%medusasghost> yeah
[4:03:25] <%caramelatte1> 100% no that is a fact
[4:03:26] <astrophizz> it's way more shameless than the grammys or oscars
[4:03:26] <InsaneClaims> makes sense
[4:03:26] <GingaNZ> very coward
[4:03:27] <flatcapgame> God woolie made the right choice
[4:03:28] <digaogrunge> words
[4:03:28] <Hanzmolman> did you play the last of us Paige?
[4:03:29] <%KeiganOfAstora> youy did just wake up
[4:03:29] <+TheUltrahumanoid> The answer is no paige
[4:03:31] <Djinnazz> that's the same thing everyonessaying
[4:03:32] <Darren716> Can we get slow mode off?
[4:03:32] <%LiquidDinosaur> STOP THE STEAL
[4:03:33] <%BinaryFireball> there were only like 5 games nominated for most awards anyways
[4:03:33] <+JenovasPuppet> Paige is muted
[4:03:34] <MementoAnxius> why slow mode? dumb
[4:03:35] <+Eiddew> it gets the accessibility award, nothing else
[4:03:35] <%Monkeyweed21> I miss Matt Lees making spoofs of these show, but I also miss Matt Lees not being up his own ass
[4:03:35] <%BoxNavy> ill never forget that
[4:03:36] <+GingerStrawhat> I like the awards when they are done well and I like seeing developers who deserve celebration get celebration but like this year felt like an ad more then anything else
[4:03:37] <%TheLemuroid> It's like the Crunchyroll Awards w Yuri on Ice and Hero Aca
[4:03:39] <%legendfather_of_giants> @PeachSaliva I think games should be limited to 1 award
[4:03:39] <Sporkgasm> you're saying it's not bad but it was clearly inferior to the other nominees
[4:03:42] <majindusto> TLOU2 Winning Every Award is the Cap on this Cursed Year
[4:03:42] <amiavamp> It's bad and uses minorities as a shield to hide from criticism
[4:03:44] <%SvenHolgersson> Test tuber superpowers activate!
[4:03:45] <+VoytekBus> Kascade can't hurt you anymore
[4:03:46] <Cjjb1995> yes paige, yes! the awards aspect of this pisses me off, it's so fucking typical of this industry that an award show that's meant to celebrate and recognize its workers is a massive fucking press conference for big companies
[4:03:47] <critiquequartz> Spiritfarer was amazing and I’m very sad it got robbed
[4:03:49] <%shi013> you want to know why the decision was made to give it to this specifically
[4:03:49] <+Scevda> Ya you’re doing fine Paige.
[4:03:49] <iteruq> 2020 amirite
[4:03:49] <+WackyGear> @PeachSaliva your saying it was OK but it wasn't amazing like some of the other games it was up against and beat
[4:03:51] <%KeiganOfAstora> Why drink caffeine at night?
[4:03:53] <VJdarkworld> oscar bait last of us won
[4:03:53] <I_OneGuy_Over_Heaven_I> mmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmute
[4:03:54] <+darudeampersandstorm> I'll say that TLoU2 was better than every other game released this year. I'll get on that cross
[4:03:57] <mattynezz> Yup
[4:03:58] <Lycanthropic> TLOU won because a bunch of woke urinalists picked it to spite alt-righters. Pretty straighforward.
[4:03:59] <%BoxNavy> gametrailers jermaVenus
[4:03:59] <+PipIV> Did Alyx only get one nomination?
[4:04:00] <ullyzeez> hades is the people's champ
[4:04:01] <Zeikier> don't sugarcoat it Paige, tear TLOU2 a new asshole
[4:04:01] <%KeiganOfAstora> Is that what they had?
[4:04:01] <+Chester_goes_Berserk> I remember :D
[4:04:01] <%T_Sasquatch> F
[4:04:03] <Qsmash_> was it called gamemovies?
[4:04:03] <OneThousandTomatoes> BUT THE MOVIES HAVE AWARDS SO WE HAVE TO TOO
[4:04:03] <+Ipsenscastle> GameTrailers was the godking of game websites
[4:04:05] <$RetroCop87> they had that excellent Zelda timeline video
[4:04:05] <qu3kl41n_the_impure_king> it was a GREAT website
[4:04:05] <itsthelos> Fan Voting is not the best way to award things
[4:04:06] <+GingerStrawhat> Go check out Easy Allies they are pretty good
[4:04:07] <Cigwynn> Gametrailers . com was the sickest. I miss that website
[4:04:09] <Jaller101514> Easy Allies
[4:04:09] <dabeaminator> I liked the part where Laura Bailey threw sneaky shade at Last of Us 2
[4:04:11] <%BoxNavy> STUTTERIN CRAIG BABY
[4:04:12] <%ThomasOfTroy> That site was awesome
[4:04:14] <HayabusaTaichou> I remember their player sucked.
[4:04:14] <%TheLemuroid> My favourite part was the Among Us team
[4:04:16] <osaka_daioh> Yeah, it was great.
[4:04:23] <%Jack_of_No_Trades> The best experience
[4:04:24] <+Scevda> I ‘member
[4:04:25] <$correctedsun117> Now they Easy Allies, actually pretty good
[4:04:26] <@MelBrooksKA> "I've had too much caffeine " proceeds to knock back a soda
[4:04:28] <de_sula555> you can do it paige. i beileve
[4:04:30] <%YaBoiShamoi> Best Time for E3
[4:04:32] <critiquequartz> The among us team was my favorite!
[4:04:33] <Dhurkst> GameTrailers was the SHIZNIT
[4:04:34] <bettysharkface> Honestly the Devolver Digital segment at the start really summed it up.
[4:04:37] <brutalgenie> @PeachSaliva The anti vape ads are paid by cigarette companies lol
[4:04:38] <ammobasket> Heck yes
[4:04:40] <+Whiskey_T_Foxtrot> Anything by kojima lol
[4:04:41] <superkamikaze24> Pat what'd you think of Crimson Desert?
[4:04:43] <Shoutout_2_b00p> @dabeaminator wait i missed that how did she throw sneaky shade?
[4:04:45] <FunkyWaters> did this shit seriously last four hours?

[4:04:55] <%Captainahab_37> no Elden ring is some bullshit
[4:04:55] <osaka_daioh> That's how I did GameStop. Just go to the list and see the trailers.
[4:04:59] <averagehero1> why do we do this to ourselves every year?
[4:04:59] <itsthelos> I blame the fans
[4:05:00] <+Pendragwn> They didn't give us the hype thing I wanted
[4:05:03] <+victhebeard> no Vanessa no vape
[4:05:03] <mattynezz> Only game that looked like a video game
[4:05:04] <$rdark_ksu> i liked evil west cuz cowboy

[4:05:09] <+CSNG> Rewatch Sephiroth to feel better
[4:05:09] <+Scevda> Same
[4:05:10] <Lycanthropic> The framerate is awful.
[4:05:10] <Jontman42> that's how it be to be old and cynical
[4:05:10] <+gustavozxd> just like black desert LUL
[4:05:11] <mpo9> will this be uploaded to YouTube
[4:05:12] <twistedj3ster> Evil West looked good until it said DONTNOD is making it
[4:05:15] <Gallhint> oh my god r/EldenRing those poor fucking bastards
[4:05:16] <$NitronStreams> ITs gets good after 200 hours
[4:05:17] <%Captainahab_37> just play 50 hours bro it gets better
[4:05:17] <+Ipsenscastle> It looked like Dragons Dogma with particles and jank
[4:05:19] <ShadeTheNovice> yeah thats my feel of it too
[4:05:19] <dabeaminator> @Shoutout_2_b00p Her entire acceptance speech was about how good and impactful the first game was.
[4:05:20] <k_af> ????
[4:05:20] <+ThreeStrikes_> Pat you just called out every Korean MMO
[4:05:21] <%Monkeyweed21> too much of TLoU 2 is well made for me to call it bad, but it sure is meh
[4:05:21] <+necrocannibal2> LIKE KENSHIN?
[4:05:21] <rosemon5001> when you want E3 back rather than this shitshow
[4:05:22] <+VoytekBus> that road trip game looked interesting
[4:05:23] <$Sphincter_Spelunker> it gets better after level whatever. I promise
[4:05:23] <critiquequartz> I hate the games. I love the games
[4:05:24] <DianaTheAscian> ??????

[4:27:18] <@SoFarFetched> @SirGO0SE geefGasp
[4:27:18] <$MrPedrovsky> @chestmimik No problem, didn’t take offence. Just don’t know shit about accepted names for stuff. Like i thought the N-word was a normal term for blacks like it is just what they are called thanks to all the media
[4:27:21] <%Ranryu692> It's fine
[4:27:22] <%Shockrates20XX> Fish at a fast food restaurant is a weird choice to me.
[4:27:23] <%GiantRatThatMakesTheRulz> it's ok
[4:27:24] <boomstickery> how do you turn a duck into a soul singer? put it in the oven till it's bill withers
[4:27:24] <%SaiyanShoto> I'm scared of the fish sandwich there
[4:27:27] <+Grayhammatter> worms in the fish
[4:27:27] <ShichiNoBushi> Two atoms walk down the road. One of them says to the other "I think I lost an electron." "Are you sure?" "I'm positive."
[4:27:27] <+Chester_goes_Berserk> Fish burger best burger
[4:27:28] <%Sotetsu> It's not real fish, so it's safe
[4:27:28] <+TheIntellectional> mcdonalds in my area doesnt have hot and spicy its super lame

[4:27:29] <amiavamp> go to wendys instead
[4:27:30] <%Profmcstevie> Yes, THE FISH will poison you not the rest of the menu
[4:27:31] <+RealThiele> everyone has their mcdonalds
[4:27:36] <Tomschiii> fish or chicken on a burger is just ....not okay
[4:27:39] <Dakuu75> bacon Mc-Double is my go-to garbage order
[4:27:44] <+Izzzyko> its SO GOOD
[4:27:50] <%McSoliace> their fish sandwich is the only thing i like from there honestly
[4:27:50] <%CommanderSqueaks> @Profmcstevie The rest of the menu will poison you SLOWLY, the Fish is a much faster acting poison.
[4:27:52] <$Sphincter_Spelunker> I just get nuggies and tenders.
[4:27:54] <%Shockrates20XX> McDouble with Mac sauce > an actual Big Mac

[4:49:39] <@Jekado> wasn't there a marketing ploy where they advertised a game by sending money to game reviewers?

[4:52:55] <+Grayhammatter> and prime 4
[4:52:56] <penitentpendant> They've most likely had to restart development. ESPECIALLY with Demon Souls Remake.

[4:53:43] <bob900000> it was during game awards
[4:53:44] <+Dunder_Mifflinz> Next gen engine issues for a Switch game?

[4:53:59] <amiavamp> I don't understand most anticipated

[4:54:55] <StormingRLP> @PeachSaliva So, what was wrong with TLOU P2? Don't really ccare about spoilers , wasn't really interested in the series itself.
[4:54:56] <+Amakuni1> Man cant they have the shreholders sign an nda so they dont have 2 announce games 2 years in advance
[4:54:57] <%sonlascivious> that's why I liked not left 4 dead dropping the gameplay trailer when the alpha drops like next week
[4:54:59] <+KingofTwitchTV> !uptime
[4:55:01] <%xemnahort> Are the game awards over?
[4:55:04] <amiavamp> Fallout 4 is still getting dope mods though
[4:55:10] <+Jaysky> Wasn't there a Nintendo game that dropped like that?
[4:55:17] <$GarbageNirvana> Fallout 4's not the worst time honestly
[4:55:19] <boomstickery> sekiro had a good length of hype
[4:55:21] <+Grayhammatter> jesus christ, 2012
[4:55:21] <%optimasmaximas> yup LUL
[4:55:22] <$GarbageNirvana> It's not New Vegas, but
[4:55:22] <Goraka91> @StormingRLP It's miserable, nothing but death and mutilation and people being shit
[4:55:26] <TheChucklingOak> I don't really mind not having a Fromsoft souls-like for a while, since we've got so many random ones coming out to explore. That said, if it ever somehow comes out, it'll be even more exciting because of the wait.
[4:55:27] <%BoxNavy> its not done EleGiggle
[4:55:27] <+RaziWraith> Fallout 4 is fine to play, just no longer in the true Fallout element
[4:55:33] <ChungusQuest> tickling the balls of the money tree
[4:55:33] <astrophizz> I think serious only dev only started a couple years back or less
[4:55:34] <+Asi9> I like what Capcom has been doing the past few years. Usually, their games come out within 6-8 months from announcement recently.
[4:55:36] <+cvp5127> raid woolie
[4:55:38] <+BigCoffee> Hey tbf wasn't cyberpunk cancelled actually? then it picked back up after witcher 3 ?

[4:55:39] <+RealThiele> raid
[4:55:41] <ThDark> It's hurting my brain to think that the first trailer was in 2012
[4:55:41] <+angelnickl> I hope Back 4 Blood is good... I am worried.

[4:56:34] <@MelBrooksKA> Franz went like 17 hours on Yakuza 7

[4:56:38] <Emperor_Machinus> also Cranky
[4:56:41] <srkAres> well he just chills and talks casually like 90% of the time
[4:56:43] <pilllowofbees> choose one, the others will die

[4:56:52] <+Eiddew> Fandaniel
[4:56:53] <%Ranryu692> Woolie just wants to look at a list of trailers, he doesn't have time for the pageantry
[4:56:54] <%ThomasOfTroy> I like that one of Spy's tags right now is "cooking"
