[0:05:45] <@SoFarFetched> Some streamers don't start automatically because they need to do set ups.
[0:05:49] <nimu290> hi peach

[0:06:22] <%g0atmeal> We're doing streams remotely b/c covid. Can't wait to go back to in-person streams
[0:06:23] <%king_wragles> You can't spell skate if you don't know how to spell (big brane dot jay peg)
[0:06:30] <%oda_flobunaga> the empty uptime is the best part of the stream... its all downhill from here
[0:06:35] <DonatelloJose> it is upon us, the Ruby Weapon Hour.

[0:06:48] <%waltzqueen> @PeachSaliva thanks for streaming. glad you're feeling up to it. lots of folks have been in a bad way lately. Seeing you get back on the skeleton horse is reassuring
[0:06:52] <@SoFarFetched> THis is the part where she lets everyone get what they need before stream starts.

[0:07:58] <Storm_Samurai> @SirKeigan remix of mario 64
[0:08:00] <$Sphincter_Spelunker> @EyeFarted You saying "over/under" reminds me of the meltdown someone had on the phrase on how everyone uses it wrong. And I can't remember the proper way it's used, only the anger from the 1 guy.

[0:16:49] <%thejimjamz> Is a skeleton a fur suit
[0:16:50] <%bluefooddye1> What's Paige's fursona?
[0:16:50] <Sunstalker> You're in a relationship with Pat, paige. Refer to them as 'our' fursuits. vadeHm
[0:16:50] <Finakala> Surely a fursuit is the safest place to be these days
[0:16:51] <%Aarseth> So it's a Shrodinger's Cat Suit?
[0:16:51] <@Jekado> there are skeleton furries costumes out there
[0:16:51] <+NWR_James> @PeachSaliva is a musky husky, isn't she
[0:16:51] <ChrisPlaysThing> I mean, fursuits are pretty good at keeping diseases out i guess
[0:16:51] <freelancebabymaker> is her fursona a juggalo?
[0:16:52] <Dreigun> We just assume, tho
[0:16:52] <%EyeFarted> WE CAN SMELL THE FUR SUITS OVER THE STREAM
[0:16:54] <Dragovus> @PeachSaliva doesn't want us to know about all the lewd skeleton art on her phone
[0:16:55] <Dhurkst> It's to cover up the SKELLUHTUNS
[0:16:56] <EuropanLamprey> Just look for a Raccoon walking into a door, that's Paige
[0:16:56] <Profmcstevie> One of these fur suit weirdos will respond to mustard
[0:16:57] <Coystick> Why isn't Paige using the Darkwraith armor if she likes bones so much?

[0:28:26] <+Mr_Pylon> Why not use pan?
[0:28:27] <SirKeigan> JUST USE A PAN
[0:28:27] <%waltzqueen> it's okay paige
[0:28:28] <%adolphinwizard> 400 degrees, 20 minutes
[0:28:28] <JobbedBone> oven bacon?
[0:28:29] <%adolphinwizard> Not hard
[0:28:29] <%Draylle> @PeachSaliva is this bumbling bafoonary a bit? Kappa
[0:28:30] <$ImasukyLomae> SHE BEAT BLOODBORN
[0:28:31] <fairore> @owllightningmage jesus
[0:28:32] <heartlesshealer> Just make sure the dog gets ZERO bacon
[0:28:32] <%MetalSlimeHunt> Order McDonalds. Just do it before something else happens.
[0:28:36] <%Shonen_hero> What I do is cook the bacon low for like twenty minutes on like 300 F so all the fat renders out, and then I turn up the heat to 375 so it crisps up
[0:28:36] <%CommanderSqueaks> Don't worry you're doing great sweetie
[0:28:38] <%leothewhitelion> Cooking is hard
[0:28:39] <SirKeigan> Then that's your fault lol
[0:28:41] <%mikessdd> 400 FOR 15 in my oven turns out perfect for nice thick slices
[0:28:42] <%BinaryFireball> pan's have covers
[0:28:42] <%thejimjamz> PAN BACON IS INFERIOR TO OVEN BACON
[0:28:45] <+Scevda> Bacon hate you so much it spit on ya

[0:28:49] <ChrisPlaysThing> se a pan and a grase catcher cover
[0:28:49] <+DonnieAdonis> Can you order just bacon from McD?
[0:28:49] <tubit> that's the price of eating bacon
[0:28:50] <DonatelloJose> I'm proud of you regardless.

[0:28:51] <+OwlLightningMage> @fairore look it up. It's crazy

[0:46:09] <MicrotonalMatt> Without vidja games you can finally paint that small warhammer army. The first one
[0:46:10] <%MetalSlimeHunt> I'm doing a 100% run of Baba right now and you will unironically die if you try to play that game any further than you did.
[0:46:12] <Mendin> If you want fresh emotional destruction, Doki-Doki Literature Club or LISA the Painful would own
[0:46:12] <Coystick> I have unfinished Baba fanart I can only complete if you stream it

[0:46:34] <%CantWalkGood> But when you fibally solve a Baba puzzle you feel smart
[0:46:35] <%2017y> @MetalSlimeHunt good luck on the like 4 stages i ended up looking up
[0:46:38] <heartlesshealer> Paige would actually need help if she did LISA, that battle system...
[0:46:38] <cureneckbeard> Did you see the GDQ run of Baba is You? Entire game in 30 minutes, commentated
[0:46:39] <sonofthedeepsouth> BASED POLITICAL DISCUSSIONS IN FAMILY REUNIONS

[1:44:27] <+fingalights> Easy mode unlocked
[1:44:28] <$Agami23> paige makes darksouls 2 look like bloodborne and bloodborne look like darksouls 2
[1:44:31] <+Invlux> Being good isn't how you beat Dark Souls, perseverance is how you beat Dark Souls
[1:44:31] <+encrouched> Paige should play the dead space games so we can hear her say "Tarnation!" when she gets jump scawed
[1:44:31] <primaryfire> god the boss runs in this game are so tedious

[2:24:14] <+CatastropheCorvid> @SirKeigan This fight dowsn't deserve boss music/
[2:24:22] <%sumrand0> @aleate she's got a heavy weapon so she'll tenderize in 1 hit!
[2:24:25] <+Fooguwu> music level is fine, must be a weird channel setup
[2:24:27] <Quality_Debauchery> first try
[2:24:27] <SulfurousAcid> lock on to foot
[2:24:29] <cureneckbeard> This is way easier than the chariot man

[2:25:08] <heartlesshealer> Paige has a better chance of doing this one than the bone man
[2:25:09] <TonberryLives> Lock on is not great for that
[2:25:09] <+Caidezes> The camera fucked her over.

[2:26:07] <Daisuke89> @heartlesshealer Really?? She still won't go up against it? or she tried?
[2:26:08] <%thiccholaskappa> gief patrol
[2:26:10] <+tigerfang86> SHE IS THE ONE CALLED SAILOR PEACH
[2:26:17] <%sumrand0> 1 second = 5 minutes THE MORE YOU KNOW!!!!
[2:26:20] <MalformedMalice> I am eating frozen PF Chang Mongolian beef. Its ehhh okay i guess
[2:26:22] <+Stormzcales_Lair> Oi needs Zangief update
[2:26:27] <$Sphincter_Spelunker> we never got an answer to why green mustard
[2:26:28] <heartlesshealer> @Daisuke89 She tried, but panics when she gets caught in the wall holes
[2:26:31] <buerdo> Isn’t it kinda a bad habit to eat at like 9:30pm?
[2:26:33] <%sumrand0> ooo those dang Mongorians!
[2:26:39] <+TDotGoat> S O N I C
[2:26:44] <%sumrand0> always breaking down my wall!
[2:26:49] <%mikessdd> Sanic is so good
[2:26:58] <$Sphincter_Spelunker> @buerdo that's early in South America, but Paige is very white, so iunno
[2:27:10] <Slam_Punk> That wall was in the way of good clean conquest!
[2:27:15] <%BoxNavy> beep beep
[2:27:24] <Daisuke89> @heartlesshealer Oof... I panic too when I get in there hahaha. Well this dragon would be easier than chariot. Wait... she made it through the mansion!? Questline of so and so was not met?
[2:27:59] <heartlesshealer> @Daisuke89 I honestly don't remember where she was on the questlines, might wanna ask someone else in chat
[2:28:02] <%sumrand0> ok real talk who thinks she's going to actually beat Chariot tonight?
[2:28:03] <@SoFarFetched> she like sprinted through the entire mansion LUL
[2:28:11] <%sumrand0> not me
[2:28:20] <Slam_Punk> @sumrand0 2021 chariot defeat
[2:28:20] <cloakofashes> Did she explore any of it?
[2:28:23] <@SoFarFetched> nope
[2:28:26] <@SoFarFetched> she just went straight forward
[2:28:27] <@SoFarFetched> into the boss
[2:28:32] <heartlesshealer> LUL
[2:28:33] <freelancebabymaker> she could beat chariot if shed just stop panicking
[2:28:44] <Daisuke89> @SoFarFetched Oh god... but the mansion is FUN... lol
[2:28:47] <%CommanderSqueaks> @SoFarFetched Why are the Dark Souls 2 streams simultaneously the best thing ever and the worse it's ever been?
[2:28:48] <%sumrand0> she cowarded her way straight to the fight she didnt want
[2:28:57] <Slam_Punk> Man I miss cell animation
[2:29:04] <heartlesshealer> She panics because she gets mobbed during the waiting parts
[2:29:04] <cloakofashes> ...I was wondering how she went from lighting those torches to the dragon in the, like, four minutes I was afk.
[2:29:05] <+CatastropheCorvid> @freelancebabymaker you know this is Paige, right?
[2:29:07] <@SoFarFetched> YEah I was like "oh she's gonna have a fun time in this man-oh nevermind she's running past everything"
[2:29:09] <@Calek> there's a cheesy way to beat the chariot but if she where to get set up for it she'd be sitting there for like a half hour doing not a whole lot
[2:29:12] <DonatelloJose> yo this arrangement is amazing
[2:29:26] <+IShadowStrykerI> Pat should get a version of this brb screen for whatever zangief's song is except it's a mecha anime transformation that ends with him in the gamer cube
[2:29:29] <heartlesshealer> collision means the skeletons gotta be knocked down, wasting her time. Making her panic. Which makes her waste more time =X
[2:29:34] <@SoFarFetched> @CommanderSqueaks delivering us the best/worst content sipsipDab
[2:29:34] <Sloavon> were you guys really not hearing music for the fight?
[2:29:35] <Daisuke89> @SoFarFetched Did she do the cough*bonedragon*cough scene?
[2:29:40] <$DensityD> how many attempts was it on Chariot this stream before she gave up, like 4?
[2:29:51] <$DensityD> with 7 total attempts at the chariot approach?
[2:29:55] <%sumrand0> to be fair all the criticisms aside this is why I love watching Paige flailing through DS2 but OMG THE COWARDESS AND OVER LEVELED BACKDOWNS!!!! oooof
[2:30:03] <@SoFarFetched> @Daisuke89 she like ZIPPED past the stairs,all she did was go "nice skeleton" LUL
[2:30:10] <Daisuke89> hahaha
[2:30:10] <heartlesshealer> also one of the wall holes consistently denied her protection
[2:30:26] <Slam_Punk> That was the false hole though
[2:30:28] <@SoFarFetched> She didnt even fight the basalisk in the cage
[2:30:29] <$DensityD> we'll coward it out over the summer, don't worry about it
[2:30:32] <aimlesshealer> Did she talk to Navlan yet?
[2:30:35] <@SoFarFetched> nope
[2:30:37] <$DensityD> just, zip zap, quick over the summer
[2:30:41] <@SoFarFetched> like I said she zipped past EVERYTHING
[2:30:51] <Daisuke89> @heartlesshealer Think you gotta put your character facing towards the openness then just jumpback with dodge button (the backstep) to get full protection. and shield up
[2:30:53] <%sumrand0> They'll need to rekindle the first flame several times before Paige even reaches it
[2:31:01] <skyentombment> I MUST have my dose of "OH LORD GOD PLEASE HONESTLY"
[2:31:07] <heartlesshealer> she had the shield up and got super knocked flat
[2:31:15] <+Fooguwu> why is there a navlan and a gavlan anyway

[2:35:04] <@Calek> I boil the hotdogs, then put them on a slice of bread, put a slice of cheese on top then stick it in the oven on max broil for 8 minutes, very tasty
[2:35:07] <$Sphincter_Spelunker> Um, actually, that's a Drake. *pushes up glasses*

[2:35:40] <wibbwobbler> this is so fucking stressful to watch
[2:35:41] <+pebblypirate> Right down the road
[2:35:43] <glass_marcus> God dragons are the worst fights in dark souls
[2:35:43] <zamzoph> Has Paige gone to any DLC areas yet?
[2:35:44] <+Meltdown547> Use estus, tho.
[2:35:44] <$DensityD> it's a very good hammer
[2:35:45] <+Fooguwu> paige would have walked right into that fire
[2:35:49] <$DensityD> she's so over leveld
[2:35:50] <heartlesshealer> oh boy
[2:35:52] <aimlesshealer> Do not boil your hot dogs
[2:35:52] <$GenesisKnight> There's nothing wrong with boiled hotdogs
[2:35:54] <%linSP> I love the death animation if you clip this bitch with a great bow
[2:35:56] <+EscoSul> bbq time
[2:35:57] <DatAsuna> will pat tell her about navlan?
[2:35:58] <SirKeigan> YOU CAN'T DODGE THAT JUST RUN AWAY
[2:36:00] <DatAsuna> probably not
[2:36:02] <$Sphincter_Spelunker> no, chat. pan sear your hot dogs in bacon grease
[2:36:02] <%thiccholaskappa> god damn once you get in there and hack away it doesnt seem as tough
[2:36:05] <Coystick> Good dodge Estus
[2:36:07] <Slam_Punk> Everything is wrong with boiled hotdogs, it smells like toes.
[2:36:15] <+pebblypirate> I got BOSS WEAPONS
[2:36:15] <heartlesshealer> Pat, please tell Paige about the candy lever
[2:36:16] <SirKeigan> WHEN HE'S UP THERE YOU KNOW WHAT HE'S GONNA DO JUST RUN AWAY
[2:36:16] <$Agami23> hey paige, did you know that you take more damage if you fuck up a roll than if you just no sell it?
[2:36:18] <+EscoSul> block the fire with your shield, good one
[2:36:18] <Daisuke89> Chat, nothing wrong with boiling hot dogs. ours in my country have a special way to be heated up. thats boiling then you peel the skin (like you peel the protective sleeve of tempered glass on new pcs)
[2:36:18] <RagingLeo> why is it targeting its leg
[2:36:20] <+GuildmasterAhnonay> It's super simple, you boil the hot dogs to completion and then you throw them in a pan to sear them and get color, best of both worlds
[2:36:21] <DatAsuna> show doggy
[2:36:27] <%Skelegroove> You have to sprint to reliably dodge the big fire
[2:36:28] <heartlesshealer> dog slep I think
[2:36:34] <%mostundesired> My question is, what did people who didn't know you could boil hot dogs think that hot dog water was?
[2:36:47] <%YakumoYomi> Boiling hotdogs is the best way to prepare them. Don't be a fool like Woolie!
[2:36:49] <cosmicgoatee> fine Kappa
[2:36:50] <Coystick> Realtalk the Spitsfire spear you get from this boy is amazing when you power stance two of them
[2:36:52] <%BoxNavy> people didnt know you could boil hotdogs????
[2:36:53] <+Fooguwu> paige uses the lifegem, but she know not why
[2:36:53] <zamzoph> you HAVE to HIT him!
[2:36:55] <MalformedMalice> People being weird snobs about boiling hot dogs cracks me up
[2:36:55] <OperatorJo_> "The Great Hot Dog War" commences in chat
[2:36:59] <SirKeigan> Hot dog water is what you put them in after grilling so they stay warm and moist?
[2:37:00] <Slam_Punk> Hot dogs are for frying, like what Paige is doing
[2:37:03] <+Scevda> @mostundesired Ya, really, wtf

[2:37:09] <Quality_Debauchery> she has learned the tech
[2:37:09] <$DensityD> it's such a good hammer
[2:37:11] <$Arazien> Boil any sausage, then char them up in a pan or grill. It's SUPER common.
[2:37:12] <wibbwobbler> nice
[2:37:13] <%BoxNavy> you can grill em or boil em
[2:37:13] <%mostundesired> @SirKeigan Say psych right now.

[2:38:22] <cosmicgoatee> maaaaagic Pat
[2:38:24] <+TMulharin> Something, something time is convoluted.
[2:38:25] <+HiroTSK5> It was super cloudy in the previous area, couldn't see it
[2:38:26] <%Ranryu692> you're not in Kansas anymore
[2:38:27] <theamazingroberto> it's almost as if DS2 is stitched together like a frankenstein
[2:38:29] <+D00msDayDan> the flow of space is convoluted in lordran
[2:38:29] <HorribleHog> you have traveled further than you feel like
[2:38:29] <%king_wragles> Did Paige one shot the final boss yet?
[2:38:30] <%patriotrenegade> get the Aldia Key
[2:38:31] <%BoxNavy> ?
[2:38:32] <zamzoph> @AmanisHouseOfNonsense it's like the edge of Dranlaic if you look on the map
[2:38:33] <+Bail_seven> space is convoluted in lordran
[2:38:35] <$Sphincter_Spelunker> Time is convoluted and Space is fucky wucky
[2:38:36] <Klefth> Is just vidyagaem
[2:38:36] <cloakofashes> The flow of space is drunk in Drangleic.
[2:38:36] <bitw503> It’s like Canada
[2:38:36] <alliudmla> dark souls lore is boring anyway, no reason to care
[2:38:37] <+Fooguwu> time is convoluted in lordran, space is convoluted in drangleic
[2:38:41] <heartlesshealer> Paige is being wary
[2:38:46] <%YakumoYomi> Nice job, Havel Set!

[2:38:52] <@Calek> @SoFarFetched listen, I'm dumb and legit thought you meant the dragon temple at the end and I'm like "but.. that's progression"
[2:38:53] <Hydrapissed> LOL
[2:38:53] <+Invlux> So when DS3 mashes up areas in convoluted ways it's "Cool" and "mysterious"
[2:38:55] <%Skelegroove> You didn't notice earlier but drangleic castle is visible from the shaded woods and appears on the opposite side when you go through the tunnel to reach it
[2:38:56] <heartlesshealer> =)
[2:38:58] <Aydarkzero> NotLikeThis
[2:38:58] <Slam_Punk> What a girl

[2:39:13] <+Fooguwu> @CommanderSqueaks almost

[2:39:23] <Ookamiden02> visually at least
[2:39:23] <$Sphincter_Spelunker> @SvenHolgersson they are the same prescription, it will do no difference
[2:39:26] <%ThomasOfTroy> The best part is Paige immediately knew which shadow to hit and needed no further instruction
[2:39:27] <%BoxNavy> no
[2:39:28] <%SvenHolgersson> Well she never sees them coming
[2:39:29] <heartlesshealer> she just ran past
[2:39:31] <+gustavozxd> lol
[2:39:35] <%CommanderSqueaks> @commanderclaw Yeah she never notices them no matter how many you throw. LUL
[2:39:37] <+encrouched> More busted map design!

[2:49:11] <%BoxNavy> youre the dragonborn
[2:49:13] <the_vainglory> They want a fair fight. If you only fight the big guy with no help, they leave you alone.
[2:49:14] <+Scevda> Paige got the lore right on the first try
[2:49:16] <Srthunda> no, if you fight honorably they will not attack
[2:49:18] <%SirGO0SE> PrideCrown u dropped this

[2:52:54] <%AncelDeLambert> Pat... you mentioned they were fixed back when WOOLIE played this!
[2:52:57] <SirKeigan> If you go back and watch the Woolie LP they are a lot worse
[2:52:59] <fruit_pie_the_magician> Hammerman used to do a good job
[2:53:02] <heartlesshealer> fight gold man
[2:53:03] <Srthunda> The dragon form in the game is the best one, and its just armor

[2:53:11] <+tigerfang86> that's ANCIENT HISTORY
[2:53:13] <heartlesshealer> LUL
[2:53:14] <Slam_Punk> That was ten thousand years ago
[2:53:14] <$Sphincter_Spelunker> She still needs to do Royal Rat Authority on her own
[2:53:16] <heartlesshealer> DUEL
[2:53:16] <+tigerfang86> that's THE BIG PAST
[2:53:17] <%SirGO0SE> LUL
[2:53:17] <SharkMissile> "Do you know how much video I've done?" xD
[2:53:18] <SirKeigan> That was 2014

[2:53:49] <HorribleHog> Pat becoming hollow FeelsBadMan
[2:53:50] <%MetalSlimeHunt> Why do I get the horrible feeling she took "don't run" to mean "don't press the run button"?
[2:53:50] <Bigyanno> Miniboss

[2:55:50] <SirKeigan> BIG OPTIONA

[2:55:51] <zamzoph> DO IT THO
[2:55:52] <+parrotman01> Don't bother with the dragon
[2:55:54] <$Sphincter_Spelunker> talk to horse

[2:56:00] <+necrocannibal2> HIT THE DRAGON
[2:56:01] <+Scevda> I don't agree
[2:56:01] <+TopTieramisu> "hardest"
[2:56:02] <%BoxNavy> THE DRAGON
[2:56:02] <HorribleHog> it's not that bad
[2:56:02] <Coystick> They fixed him too
[2:56:03] <+Konquerer> dunk on him anyway
[2:56:03] <CappuccinoGuil> Nah, Dragon God is the worst
[2:56:03] <TheEndlessRiver1> Was* they also fixerd it
[2:56:04] <nmaten> he is the horse
[2:56:04] <+cdrom321> But Bed of Chaos.
[2:56:04] <zamzoph> Ancient Dragon
[2:56:05] <Ookamiden02> JUST TALK
[2:56:05] <$Niney_Who> Not the HARDEST
[2:56:06] <Lutre> THE HORSE
[2:56:06] <peachy996> In DS2
[2:56:06] <Perky_LKM> Unless you just get flame immunity
[2:56:06] <+KDZen> eh not really
[2:56:06] <sonofthedeepsouth> "DRAGON"
[2:56:06] <+JenovasPuppet> It's fine
[2:56:06] <SirKeigan> It's bad because it's big and has boring moves
[2:56:07] <+Flambage> You don't need to but you should @PeachSaliva
[2:56:07] <$AzureGale> Rock the dragon
[2:56:07] <$Niney_Who> just the WORST
[2:56:07] <$Sphincter_Spelunker> Horse*

[2:56:16] <%oda_flobunaga> Laughs in Bed of Chaos
[2:56:16] <SirKeigan> What's so bad about it?
[2:56:17] <+OldDarkwraith> Definitely not
[2:56:17] <$Agami23> people cheated to beat him and they patched out the way they cheated
[2:56:17] <CrookedNoseArts> covetous demon?
[2:56:18] <glass_marcus> Bed of chaos isn't a boss
[2:56:18] <vivaciouseff> not worst, cheese too easy
[2:56:18] <heartlesshealer> WELCOME
[2:56:19] <peachy996> BOC is still the worse
[2:56:20] <+encrouched> seriously it busted cheese
[2:56:20] <+cdrom321> It's been made easier though.
[2:56:22] <+Falcen> Bed of chaos is way worse
[2:56:22] <$NoirePanzer> Hard? No. Worst?? YES

[2:56:30] <rosemon5001> fuck off the worst is the pirate ship sentinel
[2:56:31] <r0termond> best boss
[2:56:32] <+klattmose> Lud and Zallen, just for Horsefuck Valley
[2:56:36] <%Deadmanslegacy> Pat he was made MUCH easier.
[2:56:37] <zamzoph> [weird dragon speak]

[2:56:41] <T_Sasquatch> Not good. I'll say that for free
[2:56:42] <+SWFanatic> Try tongue but hole
[2:56:44] <%thiccholaskappa> fuck i love these weirdass psuedo-voices
[2:56:47] <+encrouched> vendrick is worst for sure
[2:56:51] <%ElectricEmissary> you can give yourself like 700 fire resist and do it easier
[2:56:52] <SirKeigan> Throne of Want. Sound familiar?
[2:56:54] <T_Sasquatch> FUCK THE DRAGON bawkGachi
[2:56:55] <+Scevda> Bed of Chaos is definitely worse design than this.
[2:56:56] <+BubbaRands> lok thu'um
[2:56:59] <%ElectricEmissary> man fuck vendrick
[2:56:59] <heartlesshealer> non-voices are great
[2:57:01] <%YakumoYomi> DRAGON
[2:57:02] <+JenovasPuppet> Maybe they changed something in Scholar, because this guy goes down like a bitch
[2:57:03] <+necrocannibal2> I didn't find Lud and Zallen that bad, their runback is the absolute worst tho
[2:57:04] <Slam_Punk> Hit it with a overhead.
[2:57:05] <Lutre> kill big horse SMOrc
[2:57:05] <Perky_LKM> 900 fire res makes you immune to it's fire damage.
[2:57:06] <+Scevda> I roll to seduce the dragon
[2:57:07] <%oda_flobunaga> This boss is like O&S without the O or the S
[2:57:07] <Bigyanno> They really should have translated "Want" to "Desire" or something like that

[3:06:39] <+Konquerer> you can change targets
[3:06:40] <%thiccholaskappa> feet are the best place to attack taller people
[3:06:41] <%AncelDeLambert> it's nice that they added the Giant King's attack as a anti-boss attack FOR the giant enemy
[3:06:41] <%SharkMissile> Unlike 1? :p
[3:06:41] <CappuccinoGuil> @cdrom321 to add insult to injury, their pizza is so THICK that it throws off my carb calculations and fucking up my diabetes lmao
[3:06:41] <+Meltdown547> To be fair, that describes at least a third of DS bosses.
[3:06:42] <$Agami23> i remember farming this boss because if you used a certain dark spell you could one shot him
[3:06:42] <HorribleHog> like all dark souls games
[3:06:42] <%g0atmeal> Budget doesn't fix bad design decisions
[3:06:42] <+Invlux> You don't HAVE to lock on, Pat Kappa
[3:06:43] <valstriam> F E E T
[3:06:44] <theloganbrand> The devs are gamers. They love the feet.
[3:06:44] <+LeaIsChill> It has such a big scale tho

[3:06:52] <%g0atmeal> Release the schnider cut of DS2
[3:06:54] <afronooch> do those feet do it for anyone?
[3:06:59] <fruit_pie_the_magician> One time my mom got a bag of rice, forgot about it,and many many moths came out eventually
[3:07:00] <Slam_Punk> This is why you never go full foot fetish chat

[3:14:24] <StillTrynaGetAHandbeezy> DLC is better than the whole of DS2

[3:18:15] <fruit_pie_the_magician> DS3 sucks ass though
[3:18:15] <Bigbauerboss> DS2 kinda sucks
[3:18:15] <%BinaryFireball> Dark Souls 3 is better
[3:18:15] <cloakofashes> ...wait, shit, now I'm torn.
[3:18:15] <+tigerfang86> TRUE

[3:18:19] <Hydrapissed> TRUE DOE
[3:18:19] <+JenovasPuppet> Just do the DLC later. Someone said you can still access it after the final boss and before NG+
[3:18:20] <%sumrand0> DS 3 WELCOME BACK TO LORDRAN!

[3:18:21] <+Konquerer> this game sucks ass
[3:18:21] <+Scevda> Play sekiro/ghost instead
[3:18:21] <%Skelegroove> DS3 would be easier considering it is closer to bloodborne combat
[3:18:21] <TechGamer> I agree Piage
[3:18:22] <+ManOfReason> LUL
[3:18:22] <glass_marcus> Speaking the truth
[3:18:22] <zamzoph> If you're going to play 3 then play the DLC!
[3:18:23] <peachy996> DS3 is more your speed
[3:18:23] <Monkeyweed21> PAIGE DS3 IS LONG TOO
[3:18:23] <+tigerfang86> SUPER TRUE
[3:18:23] <+Bail_seven> FAIR ENOUGH
[3:18:24] <EonEzra> DLC DLC DLC, no dlc means you didn't beat the game. this playthrough means nothing BabyRage BabyRage
[3:18:25] <Mr_Mushie> shes not gonna do ds3
[3:18:25] <$Sphincter_Spelunker> So you can put off playing DS3 for a year during the run?
[3:18:25] <bitw503> SBFP it’s fine
[3:18:26] <BlindGato> woooooooooow
[3:18:28] <heartlesshealer> DS3 you will start super weak and you will skip the actual best part of Dark Souls by not doing the DLC
[3:18:28] <+cdrom321> @monkeyweed21 It's not longer.
[3:18:29] <rekinom> PREACH, PAIGE
[3:18:30] <+SWFanatic> 3 is closer to bloodborne

[3:18:43] <+crimsonharvest> You can probably do it BY ACCIDENT
[3:18:44] <$Niney_Who> I bet 6
[3:18:44] <%YakumoYomi> DS2 Final boss is a joke
[3:18:44] <Zooperton> TRUE
[3:18:44] <%ThomasOfTroy> DLC might be a welcome difference from the base game
[3:18:45] <flaminggolfball> 3 is bloodborne lite basically
[3:18:45] <Zayasu> 1
[3:18:45] <%ElkRiverDog> psaBig krinxHeart
[3:18:46] <+Birdigalore> 2 TRIES, PEOPLE HE SAID IT

[3:18:51] <DFireCreations> Hey hey hey here's the secret::: (*the dlc isn't actually that good*)
[3:18:51] <%Royalguard22> But you do Chariot first
[3:18:51] <$Agami23> you can cheat the boss too, if you throw some urns in a certain spot then summon her she will spawn in dead
[3:18:51] <%sumrand0> I'LL TOTALLY BE INVADING IN 3 IF POSSIBLE!
[3:18:52] <RagingLeo> THANK YOU
[3:18:52] <CappuccinoGuil> DLC though ;-;
[3:18:52] <%ryome> 3

[3:18:55] <Hydrapissed> ds3 better ds2 suck omega BALLS
[3:18:55] <sonofthedeepsouth> 16 TRIES I'M SAYING IT NOW
[3:18:56] <%AncelDeLambert> 3 IS NOT WORSE THAN 2!!!
[3:18:56] <@SoFarFetched> SHe might be used to DS3 cause it plays a bit more like bloodborne for her.
[3:18:56] <maskedmustelid> 2 1/2
[3:18:59] <KaiserMario> @PeachSaliva So does Paige now understands why DS2 is the least favorite one?
[3:18:59] <Badgerconda_> i think she's gonna choke on 2 and do it in 3.
[3:19:00] <wibbwobbler> ds3>ds2
[3:19:00] <+JusTTheGuyYouNeed> 5 tries
[3:19:01] <LenDawsonsFresca> She definitely does it in fewer tries than Woolie
[3:19:02] <%Keyd00d> I mean neither are as good as 1
[3:19:03] <+Birdigalore> psa2guy psa2guy psa2guy
[3:19:04] <Coystick> Play Moooortal Shell
[3:19:04] <%g0atmeal> DS3 might be the best
[3:19:05] <bitw503> Because you’re supposed to use magic
[3:19:05] <Valentinius_Anodyne> DS3 has most of the problems as DS2, honestly
[3:19:06] <TheYharnamTheorem> Have her fight the invisible snow horses pepeLaugh
[3:19:06] <+Meltdown547> DS3 plays so well.
[3:19:06] <BTRNDL> I say one try
[3:19:07] <HorribleHog> DS3 BLOODBORNE LITE
[3:19:08] <Ookamiden02> 1 is still the best
[3:19:08] <peachy996> 3 is better for Paige
[3:19:09] <Xeno351> ban that guy
[3:19:09] <TheEndlessRiver1> and more like bloodborne
[3:19:09] <+Jaysky> Who said that, 3 is fantastic he just has too little healtg
[3:19:09] <%sumrand0> DS 3 FEELS WAY BETTER
[3:19:10] <Mrbaconator> only dumb people that are wrong think this isn't the worst souls game
[3:19:11] <%Skelegroove> 3 is better than 2 but nowhere close to 1
[3:19:11] <+Bail_seven> WIERDOS
[3:19:11] <Animorphimagi> Vendrick
[3:19:12] <MalformedMalice> 3 tries! She will get cocky and heal at the last minute then die
[3:19:12] <+NeonLight> DS3 is good, shut up
[3:19:12] <@Calek> 3 is not that much like 1
[3:19:13] <+cdrom321> And it's like Bloodborne.
[3:19:13] <HorribleHog> L1L1L1L1
[3:19:15] <aimlesshealer> 1 will always be the masterpiece

[3:19:23] <Pookiedaexzile> DS2 Fans Kiss Donkeys
[3:19:24] <%Quigsies> 3 is too much fanservice for 1
[3:19:25] <Monkeyweed21> DS3 is like MEMBER DS1
[3:19:25] <+Chewygamer> nobody says DS 2 is the best in the series
[3:19:27] <%SharkMissile> I adore them all differently like my children

[3:19:44] <+Deano8817> shitty bloodborne is still a fucking great game LUL
[3:19:44] <freelancebabymaker> ds3 is better than the weirdos say it is
[3:19:45] <sonofthedeepsouth> BLOODBORNE
[3:19:45] <Zayasu> shitty bloodborne Kreygasm
[3:19:46] <%g0atmeal> DS3 has 60fps unlike BB
[3:19:46] <Camail> bloodborne is like top 5 games ever so LUL on that nerd
[3:19:46] <%oda_flobunaga> DS 3 plays so well compared to the other 2. DS 1 has the best lore/story of the 3
[3:19:47] <Ynkubus_> The Souls games in general are just ripe for schism
[3:19:47] <+tigerfang86> HOISTED BY YOUR OWN PETARD
[3:19:47] <+Falcen> Dark Souls 2 is the best dark souls, but Demon's is better than all
[3:19:48] <TimetodiveLTX> shitty bloodborne PogChamp
[3:19:48] <RagingLeo> DS3 is like DS1 + Bloodborne
[3:19:49] <%Royalguard22> CHA REE UTT!

[3:19:52] <SulfurousAcid> Bloodborne best souls game Kreygasm
[3:19:52] <%Skelegroove> DS3 has a ton of really good bosses compared to DS2
[3:19:52] <Klefth> But it IS kinda just shitty bloodborne LUL
[3:19:52] <%Keyd00d> Well if she's super not into it then I guess move on
[3:19:52] <@SoFarFetched> PAIGE YOU'RE NEVER GONNA PLAY DARK SOULS 2 AGAIN
[3:19:53] <%mikessdd> SHITTY BLOODBORNE>DS2

[3:19:55] <+HotZoneTurtle> @sonofthedeepsouth IM WITH THIS GUY
[3:19:56] <stabbityrabbit> Shitty Bloodborne is still related to Bloodborne.
[3:19:56] <heartlesshealer> !!! Have Paige do the weird mod like Pat did!
[3:19:57] <sendart> Get Huge
[3:19:59] <%sumrand0> DS 3 HATERS THINK GRIFFITH DID NOTHING WRONG
[3:19:59] <$Arazien> @Chewygamer No u
[3:20:01] <Coystick> I'm very unhappy
[3:20:01] <Jetsfantasy> I can understand liking DS2 SotFS, but getting this game on release poisoned it for me
[3:20:01] <+JenovasPuppet> Oh NOOOOOOO!
[3:20:01] <+IShadowStrykerI> well no ds1 is the best then 2 then 3, honestly ds3 is really overhyped
[3:20:02] <Garthunox> Pat she can also talk to vendrick
[3:20:03] <Ookamiden02> EAT ALL SOULS
[3:20:06] <+TheShal> Eat it! Eat it! Eat it! Don't let me repeat it!!
[3:20:06] <+LooneyVoltage> munch munch munch
[3:20:08] <%Deadmanslegacy> bloodborne is god tier
[3:20:12] <%psydaku> psydaku subscribed with Twitch Prime. They've subscribed for 2 months! i missed these streams. Hope your back heals.
[3:20:12] <%YakumoYomi> DS3 feels like a half-step between DS1 and Bloodborne
[3:20:13] <+Chewygamer> NG+ is ds2 is cool
[3:20:13] <@Calek> DS2 NG+ is legit
[3:20:13] <+Scevda> ? Not in this one.
[3:20:14] <%Keyd00d> "all"
[3:20:15] <bitw503> Factor in the life gems and fast travel of bonfires
[3:20:16] <Pookiedaexzile> DS2 Fans Drink Glizzy Water
[3:20:17] <$Sphincter_Spelunker> She's not gonna play NG+
[3:20:18] <BurdRightsActivist> D:
[3:20:20] <Valentinius_Anodyne> Yeah, it's fucking fantastic
[3:20:22] <%oda_flobunaga> Never Again
[3:20:24] <+Hick12> DS3 is good but its the least ambitious of all the games.
[3:20:24] <heartlesshealer> eh
[3:20:26] <xXjuffelXx> DS2 is the worst DS game, but it’s an average game, not a bad one
[3:20:27] <%sumrand0> DS 2 is still DS 2 though so........ it's meh
[3:20:28] <+Meltdown547> RIP Fume Knight, star of DS2.
[3:20:30] <Garthunox> ohhhhh yeah
[3:20:32] <Klefth> Oh, DS2 had THE best NG+ and the best PVP, no question
[3:20:36] <bitw503> It makes this easier
[3:20:37] <Garthunox> nvm
[3:20:38] <+tigerfang86> "I did huge crimes and got crowns"
[3:20:38] <Mr_Mushie> not if you dont do dlc
[3:20:40] <%g0atmeal> That's exactly what he says
[3:20:42] <Animorphimagi> Fight Vendrick
[3:20:44] <%Mekhet09> @PeachSaliva It's shitty bloodborne because it takes the wrong things from it. Which makes it worse then 2 for me. Bloodborne>1>Demon souls>>>>2>>>>>>>>>3
[3:20:44] <bitw503> Newer
[3:20:44] <DatAsuna> DS NG+ shoulda been the first run
[3:20:46] <Jetsfantasy> DS2 has some legit good stuff in it, it's just a shame it was rushed
[3:20:47] <+tigerfang86> that's actually what happens
[3:20:49] <rosemon5001> she is literally cowarding out BS she wont reach the end of ds3 by 2025
[3:20:51] <bitw503> NG+
[3:20:55] <Perky_LKM> But just for one person.
[3:20:55] <%YakumoYomi> @Meltdown547 I prefer Alonne, but Fume is a close second
[3:20:56] <DatAsuna> DS2 kings passage is my fave spot in tthe series
[3:20:57] <+tigerfang86> you get god powers actually
[3:21:00] <%cellularmishap> it makes no sense
[3:21:00] <heartlesshealer> LUL
[3:21:04] <%Skelegroove> DS2 does have pretty good PVP except for the dumb turtle and jester armor everyone wore
[3:21:06] <fruit_pie_the_magician> At least look at sunken city or something
[3:21:08] <+strakillias> Maan I wanted to see Paige fight Fume Knight
[3:21:08] <$Agami23> but you need to keep the crown on. the easy to remove crown
[3:21:10] <bitw503> Factor in Paige is overleved
[3:21:15] <sonofthedeepsouth> THRONE OF WANT
[3:21:15] <+TopTieramisu> BEAT CHARIOT

[3:21:18] <%Royalguard22> Boo no Chariot
[3:21:18] <$Sphincter_Spelunker> @PeachSaliva Paige this feeling of rushing and skipping the DLC won't subside by playing DS3
[3:21:18] <%waltzqueen> DS2 the only Souls game where you can WIN
[3:21:18] <+Jaysky> Shame, I love ivory dlc
[3:21:20] <heartlesshealer> throne of want is still a fucking strong name
[3:21:21] <Coystick> CHARIOT UNDEFEATED
[3:21:23] <%g0atmeal> If you beat all the DLCs, you don't have to go hollow when fighting pesky final boss
[3:21:24] <Pookiedaexzile> DS2 Fans like NightCore Remixes
[3:21:25] <%Lion_kun> it's a shame Paige is skipping the DLC, it's elgit the best part of the game.
[3:21:25] <stabbityrabbit> And then DS3 pisses on any cool lore in 2.
[3:21:29] <alextrebeken> going this far and not doing DLC, what was even the point then?
[3:21:30] <%Lion_kun> legit*
[3:21:31] <$NoirePanzer> CHARIOT REIGNING CHAMPION
[3:21:31] <Garthunox> Pat that's wrong, you actually unlock Ultra Instinct and then can fight Jiren
[3:21:33] <+Scevda> @Sphincter_Spelunker truth
[3:21:33] <aimlesshealer> Throne of Want Dinner
[3:21:34] <+JusTTheGuyYouNeed> the final boss is the chariot
[3:21:35] <flaminggolfball> chariot is harder than nashandra
[3:21:35] <%Royalguard22> Chariot beat Paige confirmed
[3:21:38] <HorribleHog> DS2 HATERS THIRSTY LUL
[3:21:39] <Monkeyweed21> Paige confirmed COWARD
[3:21:39] <%CommanderSqueaks> SOMEWHERE A CHAROIT LAUGHS
[3:21:42] <shadow1man9> You can also do the DLC after the final boss since DS2 doesn't auto-punt you to NG+
[3:21:43] <Garthunox> nah
[3:21:44] <+Chewygamer> DLC is the best part of this game
[3:21:44] <heartlesshealer> equipment
[3:21:44] <SulfurousAcid> you're never going to be done with this game until you beat Chariot @PeachSaliva
[3:21:49] <+tigerfang86> NEVER DEFEATED CHARIOT
[3:21:49] <Coystick> CHADRIOT
[3:21:50] <%cellularmishap> Paige vs. ds3 2040 confirmed

[3:21:56] <bitw503> Game of thrones
[3:21:57] <%arcaderabbit48> I don't like the DS2 DLC, but I also don't really like DS3? So this is a neutral move to me. Play what you want, folks
[3:21:57] <DonatelloJose> there is NO TIME
[3:21:58] <+lordericter> WAIT PAIGE NEVER BEAT CHARIOT?
[3:22:00] <+Jaysky> Chariot is so easy tho
[3:22:01] <Rinkimah> People so invested in Paige doing something specific. Just go play DS2 again yourself since you're so horny about it SMH
[3:22:01] <yeetdabsenpai69> THE CHARIOT LIVES ON
[3:22:02] <$Sphincter_Spelunker> You'll just be just as anxious during DS3 to do it's DLC
[3:22:03] <+Invlux> CHARIOT REAL FINAL BOSS
[3:22:03] <heartlesshealer> Bone man lives eternal
[3:22:05] <Zayasu> but the dlc BibleThump

[3:22:09] <SulfurousAcid> she doesn't have 4 giant souls tho
[3:22:10] <flaminggolfball> CHARIOT CHAMP
[3:22:10] <iosephe> don't choke
[3:22:11] <%g0atmeal> Chariot becomes the final boss
[3:22:11] <Hydrapissed> DS2 more like D S POO!!!
[3:22:12] <HorribleHog> UNDESERVED VICTORY
[3:22:13] <Garthunox> GUYS JUSTET HER BEAT THE GAME AND RELEASE US ALL FROM THIS ASS GAME
[3:22:13] <%sumrand0> @mekhet09 ds 3 combat is much closer to DS1 vs DS 2 so why is DS 2 above DS 3 the story? WHO CARES THAT MUCH SERIOUS STORY IS POINTLESS IN DS THE CREATOR'S PRACTICALLY SAID THAT THEMSELVES
[3:22:13] <xanerts> guys paige really does not want to play this game anymore
[3:22:14] <Xeno351> @stabbityrabbit tbf that's like pissing on shit so really it's what nature intended
[3:22:14] <Quality_Debauchery> i just wanted the souls
[3:22:15] <Pookiedaexzile> DS2 Fans Like the New Seasons of Spoonge Bob
[3:22:15] <%SuckerPunchSyd> YOU GOT THIS
[3:22:16] <Daoshinto> there is nothing useful for current paige behind NG+0 chariot.
[3:22:17] <+SWFanatic> effigy
[3:22:17] <%Skelegroove> too bad getting to darklurker sucks considering he is one of the best bosses in the game
[3:22:18] <yeetdabsenpai69> VICTORY FOR CHARIOT!
[3:22:23] <%g0atmeal> NPC
[3:22:23] <SoySocks> this room is cool
[3:22:25] <Bigyanno> It's "Dramatic"
[3:22:27] <+Chewygamer> Play paige's WWE entrance music
[3:22:27] <+crimsonharvest> if you rest now does it save open?
[3:22:29] <$AzureGale> LAST CHANCE TO COWARD OUT
[3:22:30] <SulfurousAcid> @PeachSaliva aren't you going to get the other 2 giant souls
[3:22:31] <+Scevda> .....
[3:22:32] <+Invlux> CHARIOT WINS
[3:22:32] <%Lion_kun> if paige goes human, she can summon some npcs to help
[3:22:32] <flaminggolfball> CHARIOT OF POWER
[3:22:33] <%g0atmeal> NPC BEHIND
[3:22:33] <HorribleHog> WHAT STORY
[3:22:34] <%Keyd00d> I hope she wants to play Ringed City
[3:22:34] <+necrocannibal2> @skelegroove that's something people don't understand too, Paige will never interact with the best parts of DS2, like PvP and the weapon variety. she should just move to DS3 cause it has the better PvE.
[3:22:34] <bitw503> Paige is so slow
[3:22:36] <+tigerfang86> DS2 lore makes no sense
[3:22:37] <bitw503> By choice
[3:22:37] <unhappens_> turn around!
[3:22:40] <+Scevda> she just skipped dragon girl
[3:22:43] <goblinpuppy> I'd rather wait for a slow door than fight a bunch of enemies
[3:22:44] <+JenovasPuppet> Final Boss, then Chariot, then DLC
[3:22:45] <$GenesisKnight> DS2 lore doesn't matter
[3:22:45] <HorribleHog> DS3 NO STORY
[3:22:46] <+Fooguwu> DS2 is just "a lot have cycles have happened"
[3:22:51] <%g0atmeal> Skipped the biggest payoff of the game
[3:22:52] <sonofthedeepsouth> DS3 SHITTED ALL OVER DS2 STORY
[3:22:54] <+Birdigalore> The fuck with these blood stains
[3:22:56] <%Keyd00d> Mayans
[3:22:57] <@Calek> DS3 lore is so dumb I couldn't care about it
[3:22:57] <Bigyanno> Hit the enemy til it dies
[3:22:58] <+ArchimerCXV> threw it all out and regurgitated ds1 for credibility
[3:22:59] <maskedmustelid> humanity up, bring a friend?
[3:22:59] <+mikesapartment> the mayans
[3:23:00] <%MetalSlimeHunt> DS2 does matter, but the only part that matters is the first stage of beating the curse
[3:23:00] <MalformedMalice> THE MIMES
[3:23:01] <bitw503> And switch the rings
[3:23:02] <+Mr_Pylon> I would love a DS boss with mimes
[3:23:04] <HorribleHog> DS3 SHIT ALL OVER DS1 STORY
[3:23:04] <GravyLangley> ds2 story is pretty lame tho
[3:23:05] <%alex_id> The mimes
[3:23:06] <cherrycottontail> ORBS
[3:23:07] <$AzureGale> Protip: Hit the boss until it dies

[3:23:11] <+NeonLight> ORB
[3:23:11] <heartlesshealer> oh no, orbs
[3:23:12] <Rinkimah> @necrocannibal2 PvP unless you're specifically seeking it is complete dogshit and only exists to hinder progress and ruin fun :)
[3:23:12] <%oda_flobunaga> All the good bits of DS 2 are hidden behind giant mountains of fermented feces
[3:23:13] <Srthunda> The mimes watch from the dark
[3:23:14] <penitentpentwitch> Fear the Dark Mimes
[3:23:15] <+Squidbit> that's why you're with pat

[3:30:46] <%Draylle> LUL
[3:30:46] <$Sphincter_Spelunker> @PeachSaliva Pat beat the rat boss for you
[3:30:47] <DatAsuna> being scared of summons is the most bithc move
[3:30:47] <Coystick> It's so good
[3:30:47] <Daoshinto> NO
[3:30:48] <eco419> no
[3:30:48] <flaminggolfball> "how?" LUL

[3:30:52] <Perky_LKM> She wasn't gonna beat Fume Knight
[3:30:53] <%Keyd00d> I thought you both said she would
[3:30:53] <peachy996> Not this year
[3:30:53] <$ImasukyLomae> had hope
[3:30:53] <SirKeigan> Really thought she might
[3:30:54] <+tigerfang86> I literally never thought that was going to happen
[3:30:54] <Ookamiden02> of course not
[3:30:54] <Coystick> Best part of the game why not?
[3:30:55] <%AncelDeLambert> I mean... if the year had gone better, yes
[3:30:55] <%Deadmanslegacy> 4 streams within 7 days, WTF IS HAPPENING?!
[3:30:56] <%BoxNavy> some shmuck
[3:30:57] <@SoFarFetched> I thought Paige would just dip her toes in and go "NOPE FUCK THIS'
[3:30:58] <KaiserMario> YEAH
[3:30:58] <%blademaster247> I forgot the dlc was an entire game
[3:30:58] <fruit_pie_the_magician> I thought she was going to ENTER then
[3:30:58] <+marsantas> I kinda thoght
[3:30:59] <%Keyd00d> The best part of the game?
[3:30:59] <Xeno351> no
[3:31:00] <SirKeigan> I knew it would take awhile but she did DS1 DLC
[3:31:00] <bitw503> Double Standards
[3:31:00] <SulfurousAcid> I thought she'd at least do one
[3:31:00] <%oda_flobunaga> Literally every person
[3:31:00] <Zaphire_Saucypants> some of it...
[3:31:00] <+klattmose> I hoped for Raime
[3:31:00] <%Deadmanslegacy> YES
[3:31:01] <Pookiedaexzile> GOOD WORK SHIELD
[3:31:01] <freelancebabymaker> pat beat it for her

[3:31:01] <%BoxNavy> DONT DO IT
[3:31:01] <thetroubless> yes i am
[3:31:01] <HorribleHog> I also hoped

[3:31:02] <$Sphincter_Spelunker> big lies
[3:31:03] <Hydrapissed> NAH
[3:31:03] <yeetdabsenpai69> I thought she was big and strong!
[3:31:03] <SirKeigan> YES
[3:31:04] <Coystick> FUME
[3:31:04] <%superc37> She did the dlc for 1 and bloodborne
[3:31:04] <$ImasukyLomae> hope is dead
[3:31:05] <Garthunox> Woolie did it...
[3:31:05] <+Whiskey_T_Foxtrot> they assumed this was the eternal stream game
[3:31:05] <penitentpentwitch> DLC = 2 more years of this
[3:31:05] <%g0atmeal> I thought she would beat the valley on her first try
[3:31:06] <Daoshinto> never. thought shed give up a horsefuck valley
[3:31:07] <+HiroTSK5> At lwast take a peak
[3:31:08] <$Agami23> no, fuck it
[3:31:08] <SirKeigan> She did DS1 DLC
[3:31:08] <+BuriasDempsey> YES
[3:31:09] <TechGamer> You won't
[3:31:09] <KaiserMario> ye ye ye ye ye
[3:31:11] <Pakooboomi> BEAT GAME THAN PLAY NEXT GAME
[3:31:11] <+bendatron> i atleast wanted fume knight
[3:31:11] <+necrocannibal2> DS2 is long as fuck, man
[3:31:11] <xanerts> nooo
[3:31:11] <coreyyotto> im more excited for ds3 tbh
[3:31:11] <Mr_Mushie> I didnt think she would do ds3
[3:31:11] <%walternatorz> See you next decade
[3:31:12] <CappuccinoGuil> PAIGE LETTING 3 WOMEN LIVE, THAT'S A RECORD
[3:31:12] <Bigyanno> At least look at the Ice DLC, it's cool
[3:31:13] <shadow1man9> I was hopping for Fume Knight
[3:31:13] <heartlesshealer> no no no
[3:31:14] <bitw503> Pat is like a cheat code
[3:31:14] <BlindGato> Yeah skipping the BEST part of the game
[3:31:15] <%LysdexicAndVolingit> Don't do it! Just go to DS3
[3:31:15] <TechGamer> Garrented you won't
[3:31:15] <DatAsuna> that's a no
[3:31:15] <+Scevda> you are not going to do that
[3:31:15] <RiverBirch> Can you do the cool Ice DLC One though?!?!?!
[3:31:16] <+marsantas> I had heard Paige WASN'T a coward
[3:31:17] <sumire_gelato> imo not doing the dlc is like not doing the game
[3:31:17] <flaminggolfball> pats right
[3:31:17] <RagingLeo> DONT' GET GUILTED
[3:31:17] <rosemon5001> less than nothing was given
[3:31:18] <$AzureGale> Not gon' happen that way
[3:31:18] <Xeno351> noooooooooooo
[3:31:19] <bitw503> Oh hell no
[3:31:19] <%emperordread> DS3 is just kinda a way better game tbh
[3:31:20] <CrookedNoseArts> Why would we finish the game?
[3:31:20] <Ookamiden02> not happening
[3:31:20] <GravyLangley> forget ds3, play sekiro
[3:31:22] <Coystick> Heart=Broken
[3:31:22] <+JusTTheGuyYouNeed> i didn't even thought she was going to finish the game
[3:31:23] <Pookiedaexzile> DS2 FANS PLAY USING STYLISH MODE
[3:31:23] <heartlesshealer> different fighting systems will hurt the Paige
[3:31:23] <SirKeigan> I know it's not as long but still
[3:31:23] <%MetalSlimeHunt> I just thought that she wouldn't....disappoint us :(
[3:31:24] <Jetsfantasy> DLC is another 2 years at least
[3:31:25] <+CptCreampuff16> do at least ice crown
[3:31:25] <SirKeigan> DLC is DLC
[3:31:26] <%BoxNavy> this game sucks to do
[3:31:27] <+tigerfang86> true
[3:31:28] <bitw503> Not now no
[3:31:30] <peachy996> You could always save the DLC for later on in life. like 4 years from now
[3:31:30] <goblinpuppy> I mean just running through the DLC a bit and playing what she thinks looks fun
[3:31:31] <$Sphincter_Spelunker> you know DS3 has dlc as well
[3:31:32] <Monkeyweed21> Take a break from DS for a bit and stream Grim Fandango @PeachSaliva
[3:31:32] <+Caidezes> DS3 DLC?
[3:31:33] <Coystick> so good tho
[3:31:33] <SirKeigan> Do it but be better
[3:31:35] <%linSP> the entire game, but BETTER
[3:31:36] <+CptCreampuff16> there are bets on this
[3:31:36] <SirKeigan> DS3 DLC?!
[3:31:36] <+AbnormalVoid> like, half the game again
[3:31:37] <SulfurousAcid> it's pretty nice as far as dlc's go
[3:31:37] <vivaciouseff> like not the terrible superbosses but yea i thought DLC
[3:31:37] <%Keyd00d> More of a good thing
[3:31:39] <%Deadmanslegacy> SHE Better do the ds3 dlcs
[3:31:40] <heartlesshealer> You'll get combat system whiplash if you go back after DS3
[3:31:40] <%oda_flobunaga> the entire game in length except good
[3:31:41] <%g0atmeal> The DLCs are a lot harder so I guess it's fair
[3:31:42] <shadow1man9> At least Iron King DLC
[3:31:43] <bitw503> Waste your time on it
[3:31:43] <TheStrongBanana> DS2 dlc is definitely the best stuff in the game
[3:31:43] <+cdrom321> Don't miss out on DS2 DLC.
[3:31:44] <SirKeigan> DS3 won't be as long
[3:31:44] <%QueequegTheater> @PeachSaliva The entire game again but BETTER
[3:31:44] <freelancebabymaker> this entire playthrough has been such a fucking slog that i no longer care
[3:31:44] <whitebatsy> I thought she was gonna dip into the beginning of each one then give up almost immediately

[3:31:44] <themagic_conch> its okay guys, ds2 dlc just went to a farm very far away
[3:31:44] <+TallYoda08> psaWink psaWink psaWink psaWink
[3:31:45] <+brandanvh> Why even play DS2 if you're not gonna play the DLC, shoulda skipped to DS3
[3:31:46] <coreyyotto> emlo supports this decision
[3:31:47] <SirFancySwank> its also super hard compared to the main game
[3:31:47] <$AzureGale> So much for time saving
[3:31:47] <%CommanderSqueaks> Eat food woman

[3:32:10] <%ElkRiverDog> Raid Woolie
[3:32:16] <$Arazien> If Paige had a stable schedule we could reasonably expect a finish, but is it stands this is what's best for her.
[3:32:16] <KaiserMario> I thought she was, but I wasn't surprised she doesn't wan to
[3:32:18] <Rikui_> Pat "The DLC is the best part" also pat "lol let's not do it Kappa
[3:32:19] <Monkeyweed21> You did this to yourself by only streaming once a month and making almost no progress every stream
[3:32:19] <%BoxNavy> DansGame
[3:32:26] <%superc37> Paige you did the dlc for bloodborne and thats infinitely tougher than anything in 2
[3:32:29] <+SWFanatic> psaWink
[3:32:31] <heartlesshealer> Hi Elmo
[3:32:33] <+brandanvh> Paige should play king's field
[3:32:33] <SirKeigan> I had a Persian cat. SHE HAD SHIT STUCK TO PLACES YOU NEVER HEARD OF
[3:32:34] <Bigyanno> My brother has 2 very fluffy cats and they're constantly getting the poop butts

[3:32:59] <SulfurousAcid> like mgs or something
[3:33:00] <+cdrom321> DS2 DLC isn't super tough if you're doing it last.
[3:33:03] <%oda_flobunaga> difficulty is one consideration, fun is another. DS2 is just not fun for the most part
[3:33:04] <+IShadowStrykerI> not gonna lie the hate for ds2 is real but they'res a lot of cool story things like the queens and their kingdoms as well as vendricks stuff
[3:33:13] <heartlesshealer> <3
[3:33:16] <someonionbro> aww
[3:33:16] <flaminggolfball> how do i sub to elmo?
[3:33:18] <+tigerfang86> DS2 is not worth the sadness to get to the fun part at the very end
[3:33:20] <DatAsuna> he flee
[3:33:26] <%CommanderSqueaks> You did very good today and we're all very proud of you, Peach.

[3:34:21] <+dingobroyt> Seeing how long your cat is makes me realise how smol my cat is
[3:34:22] <moosemonkey397> horsefuck alley is great
[3:34:22] <TechGamer> At least see it
[3:34:23] <heartlesshealer> The bone man
[3:34:24] <%Savages4Blood> ancient dragonnnn
[3:34:24] <+CptCreampuff16> its in ice dlc
[3:34:24] <Mr_Mushie> ??
[3:34:26] <%2017y> i just had a nice bike ride how was the stream
[3:34:26] <Mr_Mushie> LUL
[3:34:27] <rosemon5001> its an optional area
[3:34:30] <someonionbro> Oh no Frigid Wastes
[3:34:31] <%2017y> OHH
[3:34:32] <Wintorz> 🐎
[3:34:33] <%SharkMissile> The horse area sucks so bad
[3:34:33] <Coystick> Not 99% since you're not doing DLC, maybe 60% complete
[3:34:33] <BTRNDL> it's the worst place in world
[3:34:34] <$KnivesEve> did paige finish?
[3:34:36] <moosemonkey397> i unironically love horsefuck alley
[3:34:36] <someonionbro> Fuck Frigid Wastes
[3:34:37] <+Mr_Pylon> No Pairge, YOU gave up on chariot
[3:34:38] <HorribleHog> All horses are optional
[3:34:38] <+DinnerCalzone> oh yeah, that's like the one part of the game I never finished
[3:34:39] <%2017y> not the chariot... "Horse Fuck Alley"
[3:34:39] <@SoFarFetched> she will finish another day
[3:34:40] <%oda_flobunaga> Animopron valley
[3:34:41] <zamzoph> It's an intended co-op area in the DLC
[3:34:43] <SirKeigan> I think they were talking about the chariot
[3:34:44] <%linSP> kill the wwwizards at the chariot to stop skelly
[3:34:45] <DFireCreations> DLC is pretty fun but the optional areas are embarrassingly awful
[3:34:47] <Monkeyweed21> you see skeleton and go skeleton
[3:34:48] <bitw503> Technically 2 decades
[3:34:48] <SirKeigan> Horse Fuck Alley is the chariot right?
[3:34:49] <+parrotman01> "cook"
[3:34:51] <+marsantas> Read your super chats Red Pekora

[3:36:13] <SirKeigan> Oh really?
[3:36:13] <flaminggolfball> now i remember horsefuck alley
[3:36:16] <$AzureGale> eep
[3:36:17] <zamzoph> monkaS
[3:36:21] <SirKeigan> So you can get stabbed and won't feel it?
[3:36:23] <HorribleHog> or veldstadts best bro
[3:36:25] <StillTrynaGetAHandbeezy> did you get shot in the leg or what
[3:36:27] <%maenos2> Makes me feel a bit better about it, paige :) I lack temperature sense on my left side, myself.
[3:36:30] <@SoFarFetched> There's a part on my foot that has no feeling,cause I stepped on a rake barefoot with it sipsipHellmo
[3:36:31] <flaminggolfball> prove it. stab your leg
[3:36:32] <+Scevda> All hail paigey paige legs no feely
[3:36:38] <Valentinius_Anodyne> That's sounds aggravating
[3:36:38] <SirKeigan> Prove it
[3:36:47] <+Archphronimos> same thing on my right thigh actually
[3:36:52] <+Fooguwu> nerve pain is the worst. mine is slowly going away after 9 months
[3:36:52] <Bigyanno> My aunt had a stroke recently. Hopefully she never has to go back to work.
[3:36:54] <%ceaselessdiplomacy> I had that for a little bit
[3:37:02] <SirKeigan> Does it feel like pins and needles?
[3:37:05] <$Sphincter_Spelunker> I have a piece of my cheek that has no feeling from dental surgery. It's weird
[3:37:10] <+buttdirt> sounds like sciatica
[3:37:13] <@SoFarFetched> @flaminggolfball someone apparently actually did that to a girl in a wheelchair,needless to say the girl was contained and arrested.
[3:37:20] <wibbwobbler> same!? in the same spot. So weird, i just ignore it lol
[3:37:20] <Winner_92> I left a few hours ago when Paige was reading donations. Did video games ever happen or not
[3:37:23] <HorribleHog> Yay laeCozy
[3:37:24] <%maenos2> @Fooguwu Yeah some days it gets to me badly. But its getting better for me bit by bit.
[3:37:24] <$Agami23> man, pat really is a asshole with a heart of gold.
[3:37:25] <SirKeigan> I sprained my neck in elementary school and I thought I broke it
[3:37:29] <lennonbad> BibleThump
[3:37:30] <flaminggolfball> i have some nerve damage on my hand. it cant feel it but its crazy sensitve to extreme heat or cold
[3:37:36] <+Fooguwu> nerve pain is bad because it makes your body hurt itself for no reason. like, fake pain causing real damage
[3:37:38] <Klefth> I get that feeling in part of my chest, it sucks. It's kinda numb, but not totally? So any pain in that area even like a prickle feels instead like pain in the entire right side of my chest, lol
[3:37:39] <%BoxNavy> sciatica monkaS
[3:37:50] <kuristinaakosplay> as someone with chronic stuff, i feel ya on the back stuff sucking
[3:37:54] <$Agami23> he'll call you a bitch as he helps carry you up and down the stairs because you're in pain. its kinda adorable
[3:37:54] <Valentinius_Anodyne> Chronic pain is nasty stuff, I can definitely relate
[3:38:10] <%BoxNavy> thats too specific
[3:38:17] <SirKeigan> Someone knows lol
[3:38:18] <+D00msDayDan> telling you to get fit
[3:38:20] <%2017y> paige ring fit streams :o
[3:38:26] <%waltzqueen> They KNOW there's no other way
[3:38:34] <%2017y> the rhythm game mode would crumble paige's bones
[3:38:35] <+D00msDayDan> if paige tried to play ring fit she'd probably implode instantly
[3:38:37] <%BoxNavy> paige is probably too busted for intensive exercise
[3:38:40] <%YakumoYomi> There are a couple of different skeleton outfits, and the mustard skeleton is thusly named because it's the yellow variant
[3:38:43] <$Sphincter_Spelunker> Not gamer slouching helps
[3:38:47] <HorribleHog> Time to get become cyborg
[3:38:47] <Monkeyweed21> did Pat get that penis reduction surgery yet?
[3:38:49] <SirKeigan> That's good
[3:38:50] <EdibleKnees> EdibleKnees subscribed at Tier 1. 
[3:38:55] <%SirGO0SE> here in my car, I feel safest of all
[3:38:56] <heartlesshealer> Mustard Skeleton suit description miiiiiight be referencing Paige
[3:39:00] <flaminggolfball> @Sphincter_Spelunker dont @ me like this
[3:39:06] <SirKeigan> I wonder what kind of car she has
[3:39:06] <%2017y> sipsipSipsipblind nightm33Awe
[3:39:07] <%CommanderSqueaks> Panicking causes back tension.
[3:39:16] <%Conyst> It is literally called the mustard skeleton and the characters are redheads
[3:39:16] <Monkeyweed21> Pat said this would happen like a year ago @PeachSaliva
[3:39:16] <+AllAccordingToPlan> @flaminggolfball
[3:39:18] <+RedMaskBandit> horse fuck alley reminds me of the "Great rabit" from Re zero
[3:39:18] <freelancebabymaker> that and like 4 other things so
[3:39:27] <%SirGO0SE> shut up bitch you fucking DESTROYED bloodborne
[3:39:32] <$Sphincter_Spelunker> @flaminggolfball bruh, I'm @ing myself. I slouch for 2 hours and wonder why my back hurts before bed
[3:39:33] <SirKeigan> Seriously? At Fall Guys?
[3:39:37] <DatAsuna> You are better when you can still remember what you did last time lol
[3:39:37] <T_Sasquatch> Amber who ?
[3:39:38] <EuropanLamprey> Paige will probably beast on DS3 because it's more like BLoodborne and she beasted on Bloodborne
[3:39:38] <HorribleHog> Unlike those people we like seeing you suffer!
[3:39:38] <SirKeigan> Fucking Fall Guys? really?
[3:39:47] <heartlesshealer> "Stripped down to the bone, there are no weaknesses left; only true grandeur."
[3:39:49] <Mr_Mushie> "Im really bad" one trys vestalt Kappa
[3:39:52] <Monkeyweed21> That Paige would take like a year to beat DS2 and would never get tot the DLC @PeachSaliva
[3:39:56] <@SoFarFetched> Yeah people were sending her death threats and sexist remarks in her Twitter DM's about the Fall guys thing
[3:40:00] <peachy996> It must be rare for you to hear Pat
[3:40:01] <Profmcstevie> Just Unga the monster in Bloodborne
[3:40:02] <GravyLangley> its becaquse its about killing women and babies
[3:40:03] <$zyberion626> Bloodborne rewards panicking and smashing the attack button
[3:40:03] <flaminggolfball> paige wont get punished for panic rolling as much in ds3
[3:40:03] <+D00msDayDan> paige is gonna love dark souls 3, you can just play it like bloodborne no problem
[3:40:05] <SirKeigan> @PeachSaliva You should start thinking about your build for Dark Souls 3 now so you can properly plan it out with Pat
[3:40:06] <+AmanisHouseOfNonsense> Bloodborne gets people motivated
[3:40:12] <$AzureGale> Bloodborne rewards hyperaggression
[3:40:13] <+DinnerCalzone> Bloodborne really rewards just cavemaning it
[3:40:15] <Bigyanno> DS3 is a bit more Bloodborney
[3:40:17] <$Agami23> listen paige. if you arnt playing the slimb climb and actively throwing people off the mountain, are you really playing?
[3:40:21] <CzeekyPlays> DS1/2 punish the habits you formed during bloodborne lol. DS3 should be a smoother time
[3:40:23] <%Skelegroove> Skip shields for DS3 just play it like bloodborne
[3:40:23] <skyentombment> hey guys, I left for a bit, did she beat nashandra?
[3:40:23] <weissguard> Bloodborne appeals to Peach's playstyle.
[3:40:30] <+Bail_seven> tbf fair she took a 6month break
[3:40:33] <%YakumoYomi> Might be because Bloodborne doesn't let you rely on shields, so it's built around dodging and being aggressive
[3:40:33] <+Mr_Pylon> DS 2 was Pat
[3:40:33] <+Flambage> It was all the menstrual blood in BB that fueled you
[3:40:35] <SirKeigan> It's the only Dark Souls you get, you take it and you enjoy it
[3:40:35] <%BoxNavy> youre just tired of being in it
[3:40:36] <Monkeyweed21> it was still the best game in 2014
[3:40:39] <flaminggolfball> just dont try to doa poise build in ds3
[3:40:40] <%Mekhet09> @PeachSaliva That's because you're playing a shitty strength build and not a dex build that lets you be faster. Or a powerstance build that's just dumb fun.
[3:40:40] <+TopTieramisu> LUL
[3:40:41] <%BoxNavy> yea
[3:40:42] <CzeekyPlays> YES
[3:40:42] <@SoFarFetched> yes
[3:40:43] <coreyyotto> totally
[3:40:44] <SirKeigan> Yes
[3:40:44] <Zombrocom> DS3 should be a lot easier to get used to
[3:40:44] <+Mr_Pylon> DS2 was Pat's first Destiny
[3:40:45] <%oda_flobunaga> YEP
[3:40:45] <+Scevda> it does
[3:40:45] <EuropanLamprey> Yeah
[3:40:46] <SirKeigan> It's slow
[3:40:48] <%Conyst> I gelled so much better With Bloodborne than withany other Soulsbourne
[3:40:51] <Valentinius_Anodyne> It's awkward to go backwards, yea
[3:40:51] <bluefire5678> It feels a lot like demon souls with similar jank. @PeachSaliva
[3:40:51] <SirKeigan> Much slower animations
[3:40:53] <%BoxNavy> monkaS
[3:40:54] <someonionbro> I hate the speed nerf when you're locked on
[3:40:54] <SirKeigan> Clunkiness
[3:40:55] <Klefth> Clunky
[3:40:56] <flaminggolfball> clunky but in a good way
[3:40:57] <Zooperton> SIPP
[3:40:57] <wibbwobbler> clunky
[3:40:57] <BTRNDL> it's good game but it's a bad Souls
[3:41:00] <@SoFarFetched> I HEARD TAHT CHUG
[3:41:01] <@SoFarFetched> THAT*
[3:41:05] <flaminggolfball> GLUG
[3:41:07] <%Skelegroove> Half the quality at double the quantity
[3:41:08] <%BoxNavy> NotLikeThis
[3:41:08] <Mr_Mushie> ds3 will play a little micer
[3:41:10] <$Agami23> holy shit thats a good metaphor for darksouls 2
[3:41:11] <SirKeigan> Dark Souls 3 will be harder with a shield because there aren't any great ones early on
[3:41:11] <HorribleHog> But you also play a tank in DS2 which goes so against what counts as hyperaggressive in this game
[3:41:11] <%oda_flobunaga> THere are Bloodbourne style Builds you can make in DS3
[3:41:13] <skrewarrior> ds2 is like an mmo its not that great its just so big
[3:41:13] <%Ranryu692> BOTTOMS UP
[3:41:13] <+cdrom321> Like Pat has said, DS3 is good with a quality build.
[3:41:13] <%SirGO0SE> this is def the worst of them and the most off feeling, but when you focused up you beat it just as hard as BB
[3:41:15] <EuropanLamprey> DS2 is the red-headed stepchild of the Sulsborne series
[3:41:16] <DatAsuna> maybe sit at bonfire first
[3:41:16] <flaminggolfball> MULTI-GLUG
[3:41:20] <@SoFarFetched> LUL
[3:41:23] <DatAsuna> or you'll start tomorrow with missing estus lol
[3:41:23] <Monkeyweed21> TBF DS2's competition that year was Destiny and Shadow of Mordor's QTE bosses @PeachSaliva
[3:41:24] <SirKeigan> DS3 has so many options
[3:41:29] <SirKeigan> Pryomancy will be good
[3:41:34] <%ThomasOfTroy> Yeah, going from Bloodborne back to any of the Dark Souls feels so slow, muted, and imprecise
[3:41:40] <SirKeigan> Get Chaos Bed Vestiges and you're set for the whole game
[3:41:40] <EuropanLamprey> DS2 feels sluggish
[3:41:44] <%Skelegroove> Best part of DS2 was that it actually run on PC without a third party mod, and at 60 fps
[3:41:45] <$Sphincter_Spelunker> face fuck borne
[3:41:48] <HorribleHog> Bloodborne was simplest because no weight
[3:41:52] <flaminggolfball> @SirKeigan i think pyro would be great for paige
[3:41:53] <wibbwobbler> enemies react weird as well
[3:41:55] <SirKeigan> Probaby
[3:41:56] <Bigyanno> In DS1 you are sturdy
[3:41:56] <HorribleHog> no weight only fashion
[3:41:58] <SirKeigan> Pyro with shield
[3:42:04] <SirKeigan> Clunk clunk
[3:42:06] <+IShadowStrykerI> @skrewarrior i disagree ds2 is actually pretty good its just not as good as 1
[3:42:08] <wibbwobbler> *to damage
[3:42:12] <CzeekyPlays> DS2 is so floaty
[3:42:13] <DatAsuna> i can' stand any fromsoft game animaionwise, it ruined sekiro for me
[3:42:16] <flaminggolfball> dex and pyromancy
[3:42:19] <HorribleHog> You were recommended to wear the heaviest shit* KappaRoss
[3:42:23] <SirKeigan> Yea, go for Dex/Pyro
[3:42:27] <Monkeyweed21> and DS3 just says fuck it and lets you run all over
[3:42:32] <$Sphincter_Spelunker> show chat
[3:42:36] <Klefth> Man, that's exactly how it felt going from FFXIV 1.0 to ARR T_T
[3:42:44] <%arcaderabbit48> The Chat Show!
[3:42:45] <SirKeigan> @PeachSaliva DS3 should be good with Dex/Pyro
[3:42:47] <Bigyanno> DS3 should be fun because you can engage in Fashion Souls
[3:42:48] <%oda_flobunaga> DS3 is Bloodbourne Without Guns
[3:42:58] <EuropanLamprey> DS3 is Bloodborne like so Paige will probably like it better than 2
[3:42:59] <%CommanderSqueaks> People in chat confusing animation with actual mechanics when Pat's talking about weight.
[3:43:02] <%arcaderabbit48> I've a modest proposal for you
[3:43:04] <HorribleHog> DS3 you get fashion heavy armor with all the negatives and none of the benefits, what a great game!
[3:43:06] <skrewarrior> the normal roll in dark souls 2 is the same speed through the animation and it really makes the character feel weightless
[3:43:12] <UlriktheSlayer1> YOO ABYSS WATCHERS R SIIIICK
[3:43:12] <%g0atmeal> DS3 has a lot of variety
[3:43:13] <SirKeigan> Are they talking about mods?
[3:43:17] <%BoxNavy> ds3 is bloodborne without the cool weapons
[3:43:24] <$AzureGale> BB
[3:43:25] <%arcaderabbit48> Every build in DS3 is a Bloodborne build
[3:43:27] <skyentombment> Yo, guys, wha happun, did she beat Nashandra?
[3:43:28] <Mr_Mushie> will she be playing cinders?
[3:43:28] <%g0atmeal> for sure
[3:43:31] <$Sphincter_Spelunker> You're gonna be really disappointed with DS3 if everyone keeps pumping it up
[3:43:33] <+Chewygamer> not playing DS2 dlc PepeHands
[3:43:33] <flaminggolfball> ds3 is ds1 with BB enemies
[3:43:38] <Xiangchang> DS3 and it's DLC are amazing.
[3:43:38] <UlriktheSlayer1> gotta do ringed city at least
[3:43:39] <Klefth> DS3 would've been better if not for some enemies that absolutely just felt like BB rejects
[3:43:41] <DatAsuna> cinders pushes ds3 from trash to okay
[3:43:43] <HorribleHog> It's almost as if DS3 came after BB
[3:43:45] <%linSP> worst dlc is ds1 imo
[3:43:49] <+SWFanatic> I just wanna cosplay Artorias
[3:43:52] <%oda_flobunaga> Butcher's cleaver and Arstor's spear for funzies
[3:43:56] <%Lion_kun> UNTIL ELDEN RING
[3:43:56] <%g0atmeal> Never again... YET
[3:44:00] <DatAsuna> there will be an elden ring tho
[3:44:00] <%arcaderabbit48> @Klefth I think some of them literally were BB rejects
[3:44:02] <$Sphincter_Spelunker> minus the reference in Sekiro
[3:44:08] <penitentpentwitch> Still, weirdly, hope for now Bloodborne 2. Do want a PC port though.
[3:44:08] <%Reaped_Psyche> Dear god... The ringed coty will never be finished. I love Paige, but that place is the devil as far as difficulty goes...
[3:44:18] <zamzoph> I think Soul of Cinder is a better finale to Dark Souls than Gael
[3:44:21] <GravyLangley> ds4 will just have bosses that are fragments of gael
[3:44:21] <Bigyanno> The final fight in the DS3 DLC will fuck you up tho
[3:44:23] <Monkeyweed21> DS3's DLC has the most ending ending to ever end
[3:44:24] <%BoxNavy> MEOW :(
[3:44:24] <penitentpentwitch> *No Bloodborne
[3:44:28] <flaminggolfball> would love to have her try Sekiro
[3:44:33] <+CptCreampuff16> i was late DS3 when?
[3:44:33] <HorribleHog> I wonder if Elden Ring is a reference to Dark Souls' original title 🤔
[3:44:37] <DatAsuna> the save is like, what 2 megabytes if that?
[3:44:39] <%BoxNavy> WutFace
[3:44:40] <Valentinius_Anodyne> what the fuck
[3:44:40] <Klefth> @arcaderabbit48 Oh yeah, it really shows. They had the same aesthetic and attack patterns and everything
[3:44:40] <%SvenHolgersson> I MEAN
[3:44:40] <+Invlux> monkaS
[3:44:40] <Zooperton> monkaS
[3:44:43] <$Sphincter_Spelunker> um k
[3:44:43] <+Grayhammatter> what the fuck
[3:44:43] <%waltzqueen> wtf
[3:44:44] <%g0atmeal> You should see someone
[3:44:44] <%Lion_kun> Good luck beating Friede, Midir and Gael
[3:44:45] <Bigyanno> I hope you fight Midir in DS3. You're not going to beat Midir
[3:44:46] <$AzureGale> Um
[3:44:48] <%YakumoYomi> If you install the Champion's Ashes mod, you get functioning trick weapons in DS3.
[3:44:50] <EuropanLamprey> That coworker is a sociopath
[3:44:58] <Mr_Mushie> DansGame
[3:44:59] <%Draylle> @flaminggolfball it probably hurt her
[3:45:00] <@SoFarFetched> Paige
