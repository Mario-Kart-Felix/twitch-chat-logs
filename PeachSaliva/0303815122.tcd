[1:06:21] <%The_Lady_Alustriel> captainthunderwolf Yeah it's how they work. I personally don't mind, I didn't grow up playing Final Fantasy and as such have no real nostalgia for turn-based rpg's. I like the format, don't really care what they want to do
[1:06:21] <MiareNoKo> Just fucking.

[1:06:42] <%bluetocho13> Fine I guess ill leave then
[1:06:46] <MrPedrovsky> @peachsaliva so what do you actually do in this game? Is actuall gameplay any good or is it just talking simulator?
[1:06:52] <+Grayhammatter> big heal
[1:06:55] <muniea0> hey Paige you should play the new Dragon Quest when it comes out on the Switch
[1:06:59] <+pleasenameyourcharacter> @zantetzuken thank you
[1:07:00] <%The_Lady_Alustriel> this is a COMFY stream naroNap
[1:07:02] <+rcand9> dont you, forget about me.
[1:07:04] <@Calek> @MrPedrovsky it's an RPG
[1:07:10] <Zantetzuken> no problem
[1:07:11] <$joylent_blue> oh no multitasking
[1:07:16] <@WoolyFish> @MrPedrovsky It's basically a Fortnite clone.
[1:07:19] <%umbypokochan> who buy's items????
[1:07:20] <Lunatyr_> PogChamp
[1:07:22] <+darthriven501> i love how you were all anxious until you l you heard the theme
[1:07:25] <element_of_loyalty> PLAY DETROIT - BECOME HUMAN
[1:07:25] <Kaneis> The new Dragon Quest has the prettiest towns
[1:07:31] <captainthunderwolf> @The_Lady_Alustriel Likewise, and I honestly just think it's a good gameplay style. FF always had this weird obsession with timing-based combat since they went 3D, so it's kind of a natural step forward. Whether the press-time system was actually good is up to interpretation, coure.
[1:07:34] <%SSaryn> Who plays RPG these days Kappa
[1:07:34] <captainthunderwolf> *course
[1:07:37] <$Metal_Slime_King> I like dragon quest games, I think my name is a clue, but FF is better
[1:07:39] <+Grayhammatter> play dragoon quest
[1:07:40] <+harryf11> how about playing monster hunter with pat? its so gooooood
[1:07:42] <mistermastergreg> Don't play DQ, Pat will be a baby about it :v
[1:07:46] <SulfurousAcid> goku take serpent road

[1:08:11] <+Grayhammatter> THE ship building
[1:08:14] <mayorrev> CHAD OUCH

[1:08:55] <$Metal_Slime_King> You trouble maker
[1:08:56] <Chocolatevgz> Be careful that shit's volatile
[1:08:56] <element_of_loyalty> Pat was [- Either nice?
[1:08:58] <%SiameseSneeze> he said "Ether, nice" ? Kappa
[1:08:59] <AncelDeLambert> @mrpedrovsky Nintendo Power
[1:09:03] <%umbypokochan> you should use game genie to walk through walls and then you can have young Rydia and old Rydia in the same party, god I'm such a weeb
[1:09:03] <MookStyfawker> I like how you're making Cecil just stick his fucking hand in every fire he comes across.
[1:09:07] <mistermastergreg> Would Paige still date Pat if he had a weird uni-testicle?
[1:09:09] <TheMoenia> if your into this sort of game, the game artifact adventure would be up your alley
[1:09:11] <MrPedrovsky> @anceldelambert what?
[1:09:12] <nexoosen> Yo, how are you fine folks doing?

[1:10:31] <Spydurman> murder them for their taxes
[1:10:41] <Chocolatevgz> Wow Cecil's so well loved that he gets free drinks?
[1:10:42] <+Grayhammatter> never charge the dark knight
[1:10:47] <stovetopism> @mrpedrovsky You know what to do by paying attention to what you were told to do during the cutscenes
[1:10:47] <Bailey__gaming> the finger thing means the tazes
[1:10:51] <Etherealizer> Dark Knight is so much cooler than Paladin lol
[1:10:53] <MrPedrovsky> @anceldelambert googled the name what does some random magazine have to do with the game?
[1:10:54] <captainthunderwolf> @The_Lady_Alustriel Say what you will about the buggy, unfinished mess it released as - and it did release as just that - but everyone loves the boys, and their post-launch support has clearly made it the game they originally intended to make. All in all, pretty good for a modern Squeenix project.

[1:13:26] <Bailey__gaming> not BOOTERS
[1:13:26] <Mrbaconator> @PeachSaliva Squatters would be an ornery homeless themed place

[1:13:50] <+Ryosuke91> theres a place i go to where they work out. it's called the strip club

I used to write down what i had to do before i shut down the system just in case I forgot

[1:14:45] <MrPedrovsky> @stovetopism what do you mean by strategy guide like a book of some sort or something?

[1:15:39] <Reckless_Violet> @PeachSaliva I'm so used to the usual setup that I feel like Pat is still there, just cropped out of the frame and possibly bound and gagged.
[1:15:41] <MarylandJutsu> BIG SRPITES
[1:15:43] <muniea0> snes era best era
[1:15:47] <theo_marks> a boy version of hooters called Shooters

[1:15:52] <+Mekhet09> Fanfiction again when?
[1:15:54] <element_of_loyalty> Peach will pull a DeSantis during stream
[1:15:56] <Eresus> @Razputin217 too complicated for us gaijins, better keep it out of the game
[1:15:57] <RichAnvils> would you play a 7Up based sprite game?
[1:16:00] <Luesagna00> @peachsaliva ya first comfy stream was sonic!
[1:16:01] <%The_Lady_Alustriel> I gotta say I wasn't expecting a stream this early in the day, but it's nice to relax with before work naroNap
[1:16:03] <%galaxyswirl> big missses
[1:16:05] <Darren716> Who'd you start with in Octo?
[1:16:06] <Etherealizer> Have you played the PSP version of FF4 Paige?
[1:16:07] <+pleasenameyourcharacter> if Paige was walking down the street and heard some random person yell "CLIPPED!" I bet she'd panic at this point
[1:16:09] <element_of_loyalty> Sassy
[1:16:14] <MarylandJutsu> @Darren716 she started with Tressa
[1:16:14] <Iplatypusprime> when tho
[1:16:17] <@PinkieTheEerie> your trolling a twitch chat OH NOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO
[1:16:18] <Animeshowfan> oh maybe you could stream octopath on a comfy stream some time!
[1:16:22] <@PinkieTheEerie> WHAT SHALL WE DO GUYS
[1:16:22] <MarylandJutsu> oh yeah the PSP Collection of this game IS AMAZING
[1:16:24] <%Remery_> Sonic Fanfiction? sipsipGasm
[1:16:25] <Darren716> The only choice

[1:16:47] <+Chimeraelite> hnggg yes
[1:16:48] <thelonechris> Hell yes I saw it
[1:16:49] <+Bonkasaurusrex> Cyberpunk looks so good.
[1:16:49] <Neontiger215> @PeachSaliva first time catching your stream! it was so lovely meeting you at road rage philly you are awesome! love you!- juan
[1:16:55] <Iplatypusprime> does it look good? haven't watched it
[1:16:55] <filialpails> cyber titty
[1:16:57] <stovetopism> @mrpedrovsky think of a strategy guide as a book equivalent as a 100% guide on gamefaqs or youtube
[1:16:59] <%AbnormalVoid> a restaurant with skeletons playing trumpets called Dooters :skull: :trumpet:
[1:17:01] <@PinkieTheEerie> im watching nothing to ACHIEVE MAX HYPE
[1:17:02] <%The_Lady_Alustriel> hopefully it'll be out by 2077
[1:17:07] <Deekman> you had the line of the stream: "I'm gonna nut"
[1:17:09] <+TootPirate> Tbh I din't notice the 70s vibe until you said something
[1:17:09] <Spydurman> Feels like KoToR without the star wars
[1:17:09] <frenchfryfist> floppy cyber tiddy
[1:17:09] <derap41> late 70s aka 80s
[1:17:11] <mayorrev> well technically it is in the 70's
[1:17:14] <Animeshowfan> oh i didnt? is that stream in archives?
[1:17:15] <%The_Lady_Alustriel> lowest hanging fruit here we go
[1:17:16] <+TootPirate> so I guess we're both dumb
[1:17:20] <%Gogogolem> won't be out for 20 more years
[1:17:22] <element_of_loyalty> 2027
[1:17:24] <%umbypokochan> LEVEL UP
[1:17:25] <DirtyDeedsDunDirtCheap> I just wonder how graphics intensive it’ll be
[1:17:28] <+pleasenameyourcharacter> "coming when it's ready" they said almost q0 years ago
[1:17:29] <Darren716> I'm getting it no matter what, no reason to spoil myself on gameplay, i want to go in raw
[1:17:31] <SuperNotSuspiciousMan> I need that game in my life
[1:17:32] <MrPedrovsky> @stovetopism so basically paid version of now a free thing?
[1:17:33] <Iplatypusprime> 2 YEARS I'll be dead by then
[1:17:33] <chocobodundee> i def didnt put together 70's ref
[1:17:36] <+pleasenameyourcharacter> *10
[1:17:37] <+jetrouverai> I haven't played cyberpunk 1 through 2076 will I have time to catch up on the series?
[1:17:37] <@WoolyFish> I'm going to build the sickest PC around release just for that game.
[1:17:37] <RichAnvils> I have to work Friday night, will 2077 be out before then?
[1:17:39] <NopeBadguy> @peachsaliva in fairness, youd be forgiven because its cyberPUNK, so its always the 70s
[1:17:40] <%FaultyJawa> At least it will come out before Star Citizen
[1:17:43] <derap41> Play the board game in the meantime
[1:17:48] <ne0bunny> has paige played the mcdonalds genesis game Global Cladiators?
[1:17:53] <Gnapalm> Nuders. its all Eunuchs
[1:17:56] <+Gravity_Gunner> @dirtydeedsdundirtcheap It’ll be the sort of game tech YouTubers use for benchmarks for years
[1:18:04] <Luesagna00> why would they even advertise it if it wont come out for "probably" 2020?.
[1:18:12] <%The_Lady_Alustriel> You're probably going to need all of those ray tracing RTX'ing Blaster Master graphics cards
[1:18:14] <Chocolatevgz> N U T
[1:18:15] <element_of_loyalty> This is a Christain TSREAM
[1:18:21] <stovetopism> @mrpedrovsky yes but walkthroughs weren't common back then. But thats exactly why you dont see them as much now a days, yet still exist
[1:18:24] <NopeBadguy> cyberpunk 2077 stream confirmed? PogChamp
[1:18:27] <Iplatypusprime> it's all skeletons with trumpets. Dooters
[1:18:29] <+GreenJudgement> @PeachSaliva don't recommend people go in raw :o
[1:18:32] <%SiameseSneeze> Definitely my most anticipated game right now
[1:18:39] <@WoolyFish> Oh Max is streaming?
[1:18:40] <Bailey__gaming> Hmm are those imps racist?
[1:18:49] <SuperNotSuspiciousMan> better to say that in case the hardware on consoles isn't up-to-par that game looks
[1:18:52] <SuperNotSuspiciousMan> HEAVY
[1:18:55] <%MightyMaxT> Nah, Clemps ended his stream a bit ago
[1:18:56] <frenchfryfist> all imps are racist
[1:18:56] <Ell1ot> shit's locked
[1:18:58] <SulfurousAcid> @bailey__gaming little bit
[1:19:00] <Risingxiv> @PeachSaliva have you ever played the PSP FF4 remake with updated sprites?
[1:19:01] <element_of_loyalty> Hydrobot save me
[1:19:06] <Yukisoda> Aw shit, the FF4 stream is finally happening
[1:19:13] <zal_silverfang> to be fully honest. it looks TOO good to be true, even more with the features and explaining said features. rings just a bit too close to past promises from other companies that have burned the industry before. just gotta wait and see and compare
[1:19:22] <MrPedrovsky> @peachsaliva What are you doing now and what is happening i’m so lost D:
[1:19:25] <+Virokwet> midday stream ftw kzxDAB
[1:19:26] <Eresus> after mysidia
[1:19:33] <Chocolatevgz> It's after Mysidia, yea
[1:19:35] <DirtyDeedsDunDirtCheap> @Gravity_Gunner Right now I’m planning to build a pc and hoping it won’t shit the bed when I finally get it.
[1:19:45] <element_of_loyalty> YEA PEACH IS LOST
[1:20:01] <frenchfryfist> the real stream begins
[1:20:02] <+Gravity_Gunner> If it comes out in 2020 I’ll probably enjoy playing it in 2023 when I get around to it. I’m over new games.
[1:20:03] <$mandragoraroot> i had no idea you were streaming BibleThump
[1:20:05] <+Leroytirebiter> a mustard witch is never lost
[1:20:05] <Gnapalm> My-City-ah!
[1:20:10] <SulfurousAcid> lookin good
[1:20:11] <missingangle> Yeah, watching her go through this game with ease so far is... unsettling.
[1:20:12] <SuperNotSuspiciousMan> well, CDPR hasn't let people down just yet. They actually care so let's see how it goes
[1:20:17] <Spydurman> the release of that gameplay makes the bet of whether Cyberpunk 2077 or Death Stranding comes out first closer
[1:20:18] <element_of_loyalty> Mustard CHUGT
[1:20:28] <+JenovasPuppet> Saving is for cowards!
[1:20:33] <SulfurousAcid> you saved
[1:20:38] <@Calek> you just saved
[1:20:41] <theo_marks> what are you using?
[1:20:47] <+PleasantLee> try TAB?
[1:20:48] <element_of_loyalty> Only Elmo can press ESC
[1:20:48] <@Calek> it's the same
[1:20:53] <+PleasantLee> CTRL?
[1:20:53] <+rcand9> press esc gurl Kappa
[1:20:53] <$Metal_Slime_King> save state
[1:20:54] <+bonzosan> Why do they label their class
[1:20:56] <Rigelz01> its saved in your mind
[1:20:58] <Eresus> saving the game normally works fine in most emulators
[1:20:59] <+GreenJudgement> @PeachSaliva tab out to the other emulator page if there is one
[1:20:59] <Ell1ot> time to bother Pat!
[1:21:00] <$Metal_Slime_King> hax
[1:21:02] <transmithim> Which emu?
[1:21:04] <SulfurousAcid> it makes a save file you got it
[1:21:05] <Bailey__gaming> will be like a fkey?
[1:21:05] <element_of_loyalty> WHERE DID SHE GO
[1:21:05] <+GreenJudgement> you can save there
[1:21:06] <$Metal_Slime_King> infinity!@
[1:21:07] <Etherealizer> Usually emulators will let you save inside the game
[1:21:10] <+Virokwet> wow
[1:21:11] <@PlagueOfGripes> what's going on
[1:21:13] <%Sinister_Aglet> save normally it will be fine
[1:21:13] <captainthunderwolf> Don't worry Twitch mods, when she says "emulator", she means "genuine arcade cabinet".
[1:21:14] <Ell1ot> infinite Paige is eternal
[1:21:15] <+Gravity_Gunner> This is an emulator? The Nintendo police are on their way.
[1:21:16] <Iplatypusprime> the paige dimension
[1:21:20] <SuperNotSuspiciousMan> isn't it usually f5 for save state on emus? or am I nuts?
[1:21:21] <@Calek> emulators emulate in game saves
[1:21:21] <@PlagueOfGripes> oh, nothing? okay. drawing with music on
[1:21:28] <Luesagna00> @peachsaliva You have to MANUALLY stack your items?? i never knew this used to be a problem.
[1:21:30] <theo_marks> Im pretty sure its one of the f keys? thats typically the thing for save states
[1:21:30] <Darren716> Cant believe Paige is committing crimes live on stream
[1:21:41] <muniea0> retroarch could be any emulator
[1:21:42] <heatrashes> is the stream over or is paige just saving for the sake of saving?
[1:21:42] <$mandragoraroot> is she stopping now? BibleThump
[1:21:45] <element_of_loyalty> Does this dimension have cocktails?
[1:21:51] <@PlagueOfGripes> I'm making sure I can see the screen above me in case the room erupts in flames
[1:21:51] <muniea0> it's a frontend
[1:22:02] <$mandragoraroot> ok good FeelsGoodMan
[1:22:02] <Eresus> I've used retroarch before, you can save inside the game without any problems
[1:22:03] <element_of_loyalty> 5PM EST

[1:24:16] <+Mehpurple> god i love this game
[1:24:16] <+Gravity_Gunner> That was awfully fast. It usually takes me at least ten minutes to figure out what I want.
[1:24:19] <%The_Lady_Alustriel> We have like 1 in Toronto
[1:24:21] <mtgtin> WRONG

[1:24:29] <SuperNotSuspiciousMan> Pat is crazy Paige you know this
[1:24:32] <Iplatypusprime> taco bell is trash
[1:24:32] <Kongro_> He wasn't lying, he was just super wrong
[1:24:32] <@PlagueOfGripes> wouldn't surprise me. the meat I think is just wood shavings
[1:24:32] <%The_Lady_Alustriel> turns out it's goddamn awful as ell
[1:24:33] <thelonechris> Good. Keep it far away from you.

[1:24:41] <+pleasenameyourcharacter> i used to like Taco Bell, then they cancelled all the good shit
[1:24:44] <Spydurman> they probably use to not be in Canada when the whole "technically not meat" stuff happened
[1:24:44] <Iplatypusprime> I mean I still eat it but still
[1:24:45] <zal_silverfang> Paige you forget the crazy talk triggers
[1:24:48] <MarylandJutsu> IF YOU DONT LOVE THIS GAME YOU ARE WRONG
[1:24:48] <captainthunderwolf> Fun fact, Taco Bell mixes soy by-product into their meat to cut down on costs and to improve cooking time and sauce absorption.
[1:24:52] <SulfurousAcid> now you can cheat save
[1:24:53] <element_of_loyalty> Pat is a Dragon
[1:24:54] <transmithim> Wait, hang on, does your McDonalds *deliver*?!
[1:24:54] <DapperHatwell> Pat doesn't lie, he's just wrong
[1:24:56] <+darthriven501> Are you gonna play the whole game?

[1:25:28] <%umbypokochan> Popeye's is bae
[1:25:32] <+jamsbybetty> If there's a WcDonalds does that also mean there's a Mendy's?

[1:25:34] <+Mekhet09> It's time to murder a post pregnant woman.
[1:25:35] <%Remery_> The burgers from Wendy's is actually meat
[1:25:35] <+Gravity_Gunner> Fun fact: there is one Taco Bell location in the U.K. which is why Pizza Hut won the fast food wars in our version of Demolition Man
[1:25:40] <muniea0> need to replay every snes jrpg RISING
[1:25:41] <Zantetzuken> i'd get a frosty from wendy's. not much else comes to mind
[1:25:44] <derap41> Hot drinks really gets you going warms you up when you feel you're slowing
[1:25:45] <+sogeki_dan> What about Edward? Is he great?
[1:25:48] <@PlagueOfGripes> I've never seen an indian food place before
[1:25:49] <Iplatypusprime> I love the feeling of getting your heartstrings pulled by some good old nostalgic tunes.
[1:25:49] <SuperNotSuspiciousMan> Wendy's is love, Wendy"s is life. Popeye's is H E A V E N
[1:25:50] <%Typhaeon> Popeye's went way downhill when they switched from crumbly breading to generic crispy
[1:25:51] <duke0fspook> @PlagueOfGripes NaTIVE AMericAN Food Plague
[1:25:57] <Risingxiv> This dungeon theme is remixed as Bravely Second's dungeon theme
[1:25:58] <Luesagna00> @peachsaliva tacobell is the fucking reason commercials states "it's %100 beef"
[1:26:02] <Bailey__gaming> @PeachSaliva also F4 Is QuicK load state if you need too :) @PeachSaliva no worries glad you saw
[1:26:03] <element_of_loyalty> Looking back - so OLD

[1:26:12] <captainthunderwolf> @PlagueOfGripes PA resident here, I've never even passed a town that had one.
[1:26:22] <theo_marks> those bugs are shaped like friends
[1:26:23] <duke0fspook> GENES IS KNIGHT
[1:26:24] <Luesagna00> like the fuck else is in the stake?
[1:26:30] <duke0fspook> NOT GENESIS KNIGHT
[1:26:31] <%Wallabri> genes is knight
[1:26:32] <+rcand9> plague is indian food near you native food? Kappa
[1:26:33] <duke0fspook> GENES IS KNIGHT
[1:26:38] <TheyCallMeVawn> @PeachSaliva You and Pat plan on streaming Dragon Quest XI at all?
[1:26:49] <element_of_loyalty> GENE GREY KNIGHT
[1:26:52] <DapperHatwell> Reading is hard
[1:26:54] <captainthunderwolf> God Hand 0 confirmed, boys.
[1:26:55] <%Typhaeon> Gene I.S. Knight Shyamalan
[1:26:55] <Darren716> Gene Rain Knight

[1:27:09] <%Wallabri> Jeans is Night
[1:27:12] <theo_marks> Jeans / is night
[1:27:16] <MrPedrovsky> @peachsaliva Dunno anything before ps3 slim is an obscure unscalable uncomfortable wall
[1:27:19] <+Virokwet> not a bad idea but its a long ass game
[1:27:20] <+GreenJudgement> contacts are such a hassle tho, and your eyes get so fucking dry. I had to stop using them
[1:27:21] <element_of_loyalty> GTFO
[1:27:22] <muniea0> gasp
[1:27:23] <Prevot> you should play DQ5
[1:27:28] <Darren716> Paige has Pat showed you Gene Rain yet?
[1:27:28] <Ell1ot> these guys walk like how Pat dabs
[1:27:30] <+Mekhet09> You should play the first 3.
[1:27:31] <TheyCallMeVawn> DQs are super comfy
[1:27:32] <captainthunderwolf> DQ games are fun but fairly standard RPG fare.
[1:27:32] <%cirdrag> jeans stay knight
[1:27:33] <themightyseptopus> Pat hates all DQ
[1:27:34] <derap41> Epicnamebro is streaming it like crazy FYI
[1:27:38] <captainthunderwolf> Big good memories of DQ8 over here.
[1:27:39] <+jetrouverai> Wow nice
[1:27:39] <@WoolyFish> Remember that space is also night.
[1:27:40] <%umbypokochan> LMAO SHE GOT IT
[1:27:44] <TheLuxorDream> @PeachSaliva Would you consider streaming Corpse Party for Halloween? It's on Steam and has that RPG maker aesthetic.
[1:27:46] <captainthunderwolf> Motherfuckiiiiin' Alistair, boys.
[1:27:49] <Lunatyr_> ye ye ye
[1:27:51] <+TheGreatBamBe> The overture is so classic
[1:27:52] <element_of_loyalty> Pat is Fudgy the Whale
[1:27:52] <%umbypokochan> I joked about farming that and she got it lol
[1:27:53] <+gamerboy385> is WoolieFish actually Woolie? dumb question i know.
[1:27:58] <duke0fspook> No
[1:27:59] <Ell1ot> you found a tent in a box
[1:28:00] <%Gogogolem> Dragons quest theme is Crippling japans economy for aday.
[1:28:00] <SuperNotSuspiciousMan> I will never use contacts' I would like NOT having eye surgery because I fell asleep with them thanks
[1:28:01] <SkyPirateArcane> DQ 8 would be a good game to stream
[1:28:02] <frenchfryfist> nk
[1:28:03] <duke0fspook> Wait
[1:28:03] <mistermastergreg> Don't stream DQ, Pat will be a baby about it
[1:28:05] <MarylandJutsu> it is not wooly
[1:28:05] <%Typhaeon> No, he's his level 1 evolution (fish) form
[1:28:07] <+Bonkasaurusrex> I love DQ more than FF these days.
[1:28:10] <shadowgilgamesh> My only problem with FF4 is that there's not really a "good" version. SNES is too easy, DS is too hard, and PSP has a really bad ATB gauge
[1:28:10] <+gamerboy385> ok
[1:28:14] <GoldeNOVA> Dragon Quest games are pretty fun classic ass JRPGs
[1:28:19] <Gnapalm> huh, octopath straight up has the same chests
[1:28:24] <element_of_loyalty> GOSIP
[1:28:26] <+DeadlyToastY> !uptime
[1:28:28] <KahtaLzargo> Paige digs battle marches
[1:28:28] <@Calek> when's SMT Nocturne Kappa
[1:28:31] <captainthunderwolf> Quick, someone tell Paige about the techno-hell that it SMT soundtracks.
[1:28:32] <+Mekhet09> PSP is the "best"
[1:28:33] <muniea0> FF is trash now
[1:28:33] <duke0fspook> 9 hot trash
[1:28:35] <Lunatyr_> I've always just liked Dragon Quest more than FF
[1:28:40] <+ZombehTaco879> 13 i guess LUL
[1:28:43] <+jetrouverai> the gba version of ff4 is good imo, is there an issue with that version?
[1:28:44] <Ell1ot> but what about the Tidus laugh?
[1:28:44] <%GarbageNirvana> The only FF I got back to on any regular basis is XIV, but that's an MMO
[1:28:45] <+DeadlyToastY> 13 was trash
[1:28:47] <chocobodundee> that happened to me after 10
[1:28:47] <+PleasantLee> @duke0fspook fight me
[1:28:47] <zal_silverfang> HA no one likes 13
[1:28:47] <Lunatyr_> It's very charming
[1:28:48] <@WoolyFish> @gamerboy385 I'm not Woolie from SBFP, I'm good at Souls games.
[1:28:49] <+Cinder5by5> I love 13
[1:28:50] <muniea0> DQ is pure
[1:28:51] <$Agami23> they dont feel like jrpgs.
[1:28:52] <%Sinister_Aglet> duke 0f hot takes
[1:28:54] <+JenovasPuppet> 13-2 is great though
[1:28:56] <captainthunderwolf> Every SMT soundtrack sounds like you're dying of an overdose of something while fighting Incan gods with a machine gun.
[1:28:56] <@thenefftw> 12 was good because Fran
[1:29:03] <Gnapalm> X is pretty ok. a 7 out 10 as far as FFs go
[1:29:04] <+gamerboy385> hahaha @woolyfish
[1:29:05] <%BLACKHALO9> I only know this song from that one Heavy Rain video where the guy fails all the prompts!
[1:29:07] <MarylandJutsu> @thenefftw AND BALTHIER
[1:29:07] <%MightyMaxT> I've only beaten Dissidia 012, 10 and 15, dabbled in a few others.
[1:29:09] <+Mehpurple> 13 is the best
[1:29:10] <@Calek> @captainthunderwolf ONE MORE GOD REJECTED
[1:29:10] <%galaxyswirl> lol
[1:29:11] <theo_marks> "no guys 13 really gets good 20 hours in!! It stops being bad after that!!"
[1:29:13] <%AbnormalVoid> LUL
[1:29:13] <duke0fspook> Zidane is trash, everything else in that game is good
[1:29:14] <element_of_loyalty> Oscar the Grouch
[1:29:17] <MookStyfawker> 9 was their last attempt at seeing if the classic recipe would work.
[1:29:17] <@thenefftw> @MarylandJutsu The true main characters
[1:29:22] <PoppinThatPolk> I never get to catch you live
[1:29:24] <MarylandJutsu> @thenefftw YOU KNOW IT
[1:29:25] <Iplatypusprime> apatMenace apatMenace apatMenace
[1:29:26] <captainthunderwolf> @Calek THIS MAN UNDERSTANDS
[1:29:28] <PoppinThatPolk> sweet
[1:29:28] <SuperNotSuspiciousMan> Balthier and Fran are the only good things about that game
[1:29:32] <%Remery_> FF9 was good because of Vivi
[1:29:33] <filialpails> fran is sexy Chewbacca
[1:29:33] <element_of_loyalty> :O WHENS FUGGINS?
[1:29:34] <shadowgilgamesh> I like 13, but it's not great AS a FF
[1:29:35] <@WoolyFish> I'd love to get into Fran.
[1:29:36] <%Gogogolem> oh yeah fran is why I like tall women
[1:29:36] <doofmaster> 13's biggest problem is that it's called Final Fantasy. Not an awful game in its own right.
[1:29:37] <+DeadlyToastY> I tried playing 13 5 times because I heard 13-2 was good but I could never do it
[1:29:39] <MrPedrovsky> Yeah this is blowing my mind of how much advanced technology that we see nowadays this game has like random encounter calculation, actuall animations, somewhat decent music, past is hella wierd
[1:29:41] <+Mekhet09> It's a single player MMO. That was 12's issue.
[1:29:50] <Ell1ot> and what about Tidus' famous line, "I NEED FOOD!"
[1:29:51] <captainthunderwolf> Also, in at least one SMT game you actually do fight Mayan gods with a machine gun, so
[1:29:51] <Mr_Strut> But what if you need it later?
[1:29:53] <admiralsatan> Fran's va might be the best ever in FF
[1:29:54] <RichAnvils> when you wanna play your favorite FF again, but its 11...
[1:29:55] <muniea0> super wasteful
[1:29:56] <Gnapalm> Man i miss 10. that games fun and titus actually develops as a character
[1:29:58] <MarylandJutsu> BIG MONSTAR
[1:30:00] <AncelDeLambert> 12 is a total mess, can't blame ya
[1:30:04] <+Bonkasaurusrex> Show up!
[1:30:04] <element_of_loyalty> SHOW UP
[1:30:07] <%MightyMaxT> I loved FFX's battle system. Gave me tons of time to think about strategy
[1:30:09] <Mr_Strut> Big coward!
[1:30:10] <+Kugleburg> women are not monsters paige
[1:30:12] <zal_silverfang> the big back downs
[1:30:17] <%bloodypurpledog> Wow the back down
[1:30:18] <+JenovasPuppet> @DeadlyToastY Just skip to 13-2. The story is utter trash, so you're not missing anything by skipping, but the gameplay in 13-2 is super fun.
[1:30:23] <element_of_loyalty> fart gas
[1:30:24] <KahtaLzargo> @SuperNotSuspiciousMan Agreed - they are the only reasons I put any amount of hours into FFXII
[1:30:26] <MarylandJutsu> MIST DARGONNNN
[1:30:27] <element_of_loyalty> DAWWW
[1:30:29] <+rolfalex> 13 is trash, after 20 hours it just gets a little less trash

[1:31:10] <NoctisxMog> the mist

[1:31:12] <RichAnvils> BY GOD ITS KAIN
[1:31:17] <Eresus> ff4 boss fight music in one if the best in the whole franchise
[1:31:20] <Yukisoda> Please stop fighting
[1:31:21] <%RaikenTB> Dis music was in Super Mario RPG too.
[1:31:23] <+AmaniIsYourBoss> LUL LUL

[1:31:36] <%Gogogolem> wait
[1:31:37] <%GarbageNirvana> You do the best you can with character limits meant for Japanese
[1:31:37] <+Ragnarok_Flames> started watching TNG after last nights plague stream thanks Mustard queen
[1:31:37] <@MelBrooksKA> @Mr_Strut Square
[1:31:37] <doofmaster> is it telling us to stop fighting about FFXIII?
[1:31:37] <+Bonkasaurusrex> We've come a long way in localization.
[1:31:38] <SchroedingersFerret> All this dick mist
[1:31:40] <%RaikenTB> @Mr_Strut Some Japanese guy. He did a bad job.
[1:31:41] <%Gogogolem> holy shit is saben in this game?
[1:31:49] <frenchfryfist> he did his best
[1:31:51] <%Typhaeon> No that's 6
[1:31:51] <%Jp3g95> GET UP ON THE HYDRAS BACK
[1:31:53] <MrPedrovsky> I don’t know why people shit on ff13 maybe i am biased becaused it was my very first game but at least it is mediocre and showed me that i shouldn’t bother getting into ff franchise since it seems they all like that just with different graphics
[1:31:59] <Eresus> @Gogogolem sabin is from ff6
[1:32:01] <element_of_loyalty> RED EE?
[1:32:01] <+Cinder5by5> All the FF games have something to love so I wish people would focus less on insulting the ones they don't like tbh
[1:32:09] <+AmaniIsYourBoss> Was there some kind of improved translation that you could emulate or am I crazy?
[1:32:14] <element_of_loyalty> LEWD
[1:32:15] <duke0fspook> 6 is the king of FF
[1:32:16] <+Mekhet09> 13 was a mess even without the FF title.
[1:32:17] <+rolfalex> hi polk
[1:32:22] <@PinkieTheEerie> huh seems like my donations have been eaten
[1:32:24] <@PinkieTheEerie> aw dag
[1:32:29] <%Typhaeon> Yeah 13 had so much to love:
[1:32:29] <+Mekhet09> I say this as someone who played it three times.
[1:32:31] <%Gogogolem> Fuck i love Sabin
[1:32:35] <%GarbageNirvana> Yeah but that would require empathy
[1:32:36] <element_of_loyalty> Poor Pinkie
[1:32:38] <+JenovasPuppet> It's the pits
[1:32:38] <%umbypokochan> Final Hallway XIII
[1:32:40] <captainthunderwolf> @MrPedrovsky That's exactly the thing; a lot of people who hate it are just the right age to have remembered the brief golden age of FF games and see it as another in a line of disappointments, so they just despise it to hell.
[1:32:43] <energywarning> or played games at all
[1:32:50] <@PinkieTheEerie> now who will help me bag on my girlfriend nowwww
[1:32:51] <%MightyMaxT> 13's music and graphics were pretty darn good
[1:32:51] <NYCrownlessKing> i mean I loved 15 once i did all the dlc content and the sutff they added to the story @PeachSaliva
[1:32:53] <TheyCallMeVawn> I couldnt stand FFXII
[1:32:58] <%HoldBtoRun> saying you hate a certain FF is just a meme to get somebody to fight really
[1:32:58] <Chocolatevgz> WHY FIGHT
[1:33:01] <Chocolatevgz> I ZOMBIE?
[1:33:03] <Etherealizer> I feel like FF13 is the one exception people are allowed and should be encouraged to dislike lol
[1:33:04] <+DeadlyToastY> "And then I became Lightning" was the David Cage Critical Bullshit Point of that game
[1:33:05] <@WoolyFish> D mist is a white goopy dragon? Subtle...
[1:33:06] <Eresus> @MrPedrovsky FF13 has nothing of FF in it besides the name
[1:33:08] <MarylandJutsu> DO NOT DOO IT
[1:33:15] <+BonusSkeleton> DONT FIGHT, fights
[1:33:15] <SpoonJuggler> you can say it: FF13 sucks cocks
[1:33:17] <duke0fspook> 13 is just boring
[1:33:18] <%Gogogolem> I never cared for FF1
[1:33:18] <element_of_loyalty> Perry
[1:33:19] <+aversal_ammar> Hello today, Paige!
[1:33:24] <fairore> i like the music in ff13
[1:33:25] <duke0fspook> I don't find it offensive like 13-3
[1:33:26] <element_of_loyalty> NSFW
[1:33:28] <+Mekhet09> It's not just boring.
[1:33:33] <%umbypokochan> she's the T-1000
[1:33:34] <BearSawed> so whos going to defend crystal chronicles?
[1:33:35] <+Mekhet09> The characters are annoying.
[1:33:39] <captainthunderwolf> @WoolyFish A white misty dragon, my man. No man has truly reached the limit of his endurance until it comes out as a mist.
[1:33:39] <$MattyPOnTheRoad> FF7 is over rated.
[1:33:45] <element_of_loyalty> RIP
[1:33:46] <Luesagna00> @peachsaliva like Fable 2 is a disappointment if ya played the 1st game but okay if ya had no expectations
[1:33:48] <%Gogogolem> 12 was the first one i played as al ittle baby girl.
[1:33:49] <Gnapalm> Did you play 10?
[1:33:50] <MarylandJutsu> BIG MURDER
[1:33:52] <Mr_Strut> I LOVE GYNOCIDE
[1:33:52] <MrPedrovsky> @eresus dunno after having 13 as my first game ever neven even touched ff with a 10km stick and rpg in general
[1:33:52] <element_of_loyalty> :(
[1:33:54] <theo_marks> add it to the list
[1:33:54] <Ell1ot> Paige murdered another preganant woman!
[1:33:55] <AncelDeLambert> that was a very polite way to say "they're children with awful taste"
[1:33:56] <MookStyfawker> I'll admit I've shat on FF13 a lot despite not playing it, but every single thing I've been told about and seen of it has not impressed me.
[1:33:56] <%HoldBtoRun> @BearSawed me, had a good year with that game, my gf and our best bud
[1:33:57] <muniea0> she was two months in
[1:33:58] <+JenovasPuppet> DKnight splattered that DMist
[1:33:59] <@thenefftw> Women murder again
[1:33:59] <Animeshowfan> yaaaay murder!!
[1:34:00] <Isord> VVymen defeated +1
[1:34:02] <Intolerable> SHE WAS PREGNANY!
[1:34:03] <zal_silverfang> the problem i think with 13 was it was 1. so linear and 2. had limited enemies on the path so literally just losing potential levels. if it atleast opened up into a more open world after you escaped the city it would have helped
[1:34:05] <Bailey__gaming> Big Murders
[1:34:06] <element_of_loyalty> Pearl necklace - birthday gift?
[1:34:07] <violetheart> Nightmare Slain
[1:34:08] <%MightyMaxT> Who here remembers Hope the Boomerang Boy?
[1:34:08] <theo_marks> oh no she was carrying dragon BABIES
[1:34:09] <frenchfryfist> hopped on tge ff15 bandwagon cuz it looked neat and that's the extent of my experience with ff
[1:34:11] <%umbypokochan> time to traumtize a little girl!
[1:34:13] <stovetopism> Its ok, she was barren
[1:34:14] <+JenovasPuppet> Emulation!
[1:34:16] <$MattyPOnTheRoad> I'll say it again. FF7 OVERRATED
[1:34:16] <+DeadlyToastY> @Luesagna00 if Fable 2 was a disappointment then what's Fable 3
[1:34:17] <+Ryosuke91> 12's story was the best written ff story imo. its super political
[1:34:17] <Mr_Strut> Pregnani
[1:34:22] <gazdropish> 13 trilogy was offensive but XV is just sad NotLikeThis
[1:34:23] <DirtyDeedsDunDirtCheap> Jesus, what’s Paige’s kill count for women at this point?
[1:34:34] <MarylandJutsu> @Ryosuke91 you right
[1:34:35] <captainthunderwolf> @Ryosuke91 You'd like Legend of the Galactic Heroes.
[1:34:44] <%Wallabri> apatWink
[1:34:45] <Bailey__gaming> giggedy
[1:34:46] <element_of_loyalty> NON ELMO
[1:34:51] <Luesagna00> @deadlytoasty easy, never played the 3rd one, i learned my lesson from the 2nd xD
[1:34:54] <%galaxyswirl> alot
[1:34:54] <+JenovasPuppet> 410,757,864,530 Dead Women
[1:34:57] <+Ryosuke91> i saw some of it @captainthunderwolf just have to find the newer one cus they made a newer one i heard?
[1:34:58] <%GarbageNirvana> dag
[1:34:59] <+Mehpurple> can we all agree that 15 got boring real fast
[1:34:59] <escourtmission> What's wrong with XV?
[1:35:07] <+Mekhet09> 12 is just a watered down tactics. Which had a way better plot.
[1:35:10] <$MattyPOnTheRoad> FF7 stole the thunder from LEGEND OF LEGAIA
[1:35:10] <DirtyDeedsDunDirtCheap> So....12 then?
[1:35:13] <%TrevyWeaponsGuy> SSaryn, where's my $100
[1:35:13] <duke0fspook> @Ryosuke91 6 still feels like it does better with characters and an ensemble cast
[1:35:14] <Gnapalm> Thoughts on FF10?
[1:35:17] <%GarbageNirvana> The main problem I had with XV is that it felt like it didn't know what it wanted to be
[1:35:19] <Eresus> @MrPedrovsky the safest games in the franchise to try are ff9 are ff10 as those ones are the most solid entries. but if you dont like jrpgs in general you will not like them anyway
[1:35:21] <$OdysseyKnight> Just got here and she got the fucking Imp spell drop that fast?!
[1:35:22] <@thenefftw> @SSaryn That's big money, you weirdo
[1:35:22] <%GarbageNirvana> And also the pacing was all over the place
[1:35:25] <%Typhaeon> 15 is all over the place
[1:35:28] <%Typhaeon> whoops
[1:35:28] <+Mekhet09> Legend of legaia is great.
[1:35:30] <xeros720> what, 15 was good, you have to like boys doing boy thing though
[1:35:33] <element_of_loyalty> ITS QUIET
[1:35:34] <TheyCallMeVawn> FFXV is honestly the best FF to me. At least the version that came out on PC.
[1:35:36] <@WoolyFish> FF15 is fun to play, terrible to watch.
[1:35:36] <Mr_Strut> How many pregnant women were in that village?
[1:35:36] <gazdropish> I mean jesus what's right with XV?
[1:35:37] <+Mekhet09> I wish I had a computer that could play it.
[1:35:40] <captainthunderwolf> @Ryosuke91 There's an OVA, I believe, and another coming out afterwards, but both are sort of reliant on the original from the 80's I believe. Still, I'd be surprised if they didn't stand on their own.
[1:35:44] <+JenovasPuppet> Murder is the coolest
[1:35:46] <Yukisoda> Bomb voyage
[1:35:48] <%Remery_> 15 is BRO the game
[1:35:51] <Etherealizer> yeyeye get those dirty Mist villagers
[1:35:52] <%MightyMaxT> Oh yeah, green hair girl!

[1:35:59] <%umbypokochan> Saga Frontier is best PS1 RPG - fight me
[1:36:01] <captainthunderwolf> You guys set off a fucking NUKE.
[1:36:01] <+Mekhet09> It's ashame about the sequel to the game.
[1:36:02] <Animeshowfan> man when i hear old sound effects like this it just makes me feel so happy. they have such an amazing charm

[1:36:36] <element_of_loyalty> DEATH
[1:36:39] <zaitje> Does this mean Paige just killed a whole village worth of women?
[1:36:40] <CatsEyeBlind> I remember thinking 13 was alright when it first came out. Not worth getting 2 sequels but not terrible either
[1:36:41] <derap41> Fucking whoops
[1:36:44] <+TsundereHunter> Paige’s a terrorist now
[1:36:45] <+BoboDaHobo> just got home from work. I was hoping she was still reading donations

[1:39:24] <+darthriven501> BRUH
[1:39:26] <+JenovasPuppet> Remember, the easiest way to adopt is just kill the child's real parents.

[1:39:54] <Eresus> @MrPedrovsky for what is worth, FF9 and FF10 are both on the steam store, so you can always check them out
[1:39:54] <TheLuxorDream> The seed has been planted, and I'm not talking about the preggernante
[1:39:56] <@WoolyFish> Just use a hamburger wrapper to cover your sexy bits.
[1:40:02] <captainthunderwolf> Thank god these flying monsters are at sword range.
[1:40:09] <element_of_loyalty> Pat n Paige killed Elmo's PARENTS
[1:40:10] <Gnapalm> WHAT DID MOTHS DO BEFORE LIGHTS?
[1:40:14] <%Typhaeon> obvious filet-o-fish joke here
[1:40:15] <captainthunderwolf> Because damn, imagine if they were literally just eight feet up.
[1:40:25] <+AntithesisEK> this is so early in the day I'm used to witnessing horrific things in the night.
[1:40:28] <xeros720> oh shit, blind actually works in this game
[1:40:29] <+Mekhet09> The old games on steam like 4 and 5 are trash though. God those games look like a mobile port.
[1:40:33] <@thenefftw> No, poor moff
[1:40:49] <Risingxiv> because they are mobile ports
[1:40:49] <%umbypokochan> @MattyPOnTheRoad i see :|
[1:40:55] <@thenefftw> DK Night

[1:41:01] <Malala2018> Hey Peach. I don't know if you and Pat have ever talked about it before, but how did you two ever meet?

[1:41:29] <Risingxiv> 4
[1:41:30] <+TsundereHunter> 4
[1:41:32] <frenchfryfist> 4
[1:41:35] <element_of_loyalty> 5
[1:41:35] <%galaxyswirl> 4/2

[1:41:45] <$mandragoraroot> 69
[1:41:46] <MrPedrovsky> @eresus i could just need to get over enormous wall of wierdness first so i can actually play anything that came out before i started playing games i think i started on gaming in 2012 or something, don’t quite remember, whenever ps3 slim + ff13 bundle was on sale
[1:41:46] <+AntithesisEK> 4's so simple but satisfying
[1:41:48] <%Typhaeon> It's short for "intravenous"
[1:41:49] <mercado94> 358/2
[1:41:50] <Yukisoda> 15
[1:42:03] <Mr_Strut> Moths are cute tho
[1:42:03] <captainthunderwolf> @Bailey__gaming The fact that you haven't just means that they're good at hiding.
[1:42:09] <SuperNotSuspiciousMan> IV = 4
[1:42:11] <@thenefftw> Moths are big cute
[1:42:15] <+E_Darkness> I literally had a moth thay big
[1:42:18] <@WoolyFish> Schools don't teach roman numerals anymore? Jesus Christ...
[1:42:20] <Gnapalm> IV = 2
[1:42:21] <duke0fspook> IV clearly = 2
[1:42:24] <$MattyPOnTheRoad> @umbypokochan it ok. there are other things I can and do play, good stuff. perhaps I will see you around ;)
[1:42:32] <element_of_loyalty> I II III IV
[1:42:38] <roburabu> I learnt roman numerals from the simpson episode, where bart has to escape
[1:42:39] <+E_Darkness> MOTHS ARE CUTE, BUT NOT WHEN THEY BIG AND FLY INTO THINGS MAKING THUDS. NOT CUTE, SCARY, DO NOT WANT TO EAT
[1:42:42] <Bailey__gaming> @WoolyFish they were stopping when i was in school many moons ago,
[1:42:45] <Darren716> Paige we all know you like FF IV because it stands for your IV drip of mustard and drugs
[1:42:46] <theo_marks> IV is 2 Because there are two characters in it DUH
[1:42:47] <captainthunderwolf> @WoolyFish Yeah man, I hear that abacuses and goat-skinning classes are on their way out too.
[1:43:02] <escourtmission> @woolyfish I only know Roman numerals because of Star Wars and Final Fantasy, honestly.
[1:43:06] <%umbypokochan> can back on that dick....................show.
[1:43:07] <element_of_loyalty> RIP Dickmasterson
[1:43:12] <zal_silverfang> Hell, they dont even really teach you how to read a conventional clock anymore
[1:43:20] <@WoolyFish> Christ...
[1:43:21] <muniea0> what snes rpgs have you played Paige? So we can judge you
[1:43:24] <MarylandJutsu> Paige Episodes are the BEST DICK EPISODES
[1:43:25] <+PleasantLee> how often are you Eli and Pat going to watch Star Trek TNG episodes?
[1:43:26] <+AntithesisEK> that sounded like the innkeeper had WAY too much coffee. NO MONEY? IT'S OKAY GO UP NAP NOW
[1:43:26] <emillionghost> thank u all
[1:43:30] <+Gravity_Gunner> I learned Roman numerals at school. Apparently nobody else did seeing how much trouble they gave my friends when we did an escape room where they were part of a puzzle.
[1:43:31] <%galaxyswirl> rydia so cute
[1:43:43] <$MattyPOnTheRoad> @peachsaliva come to San Diego and throw down with Denzel
[1:43:45] <element_of_loyalty> ELMO BESTY\
[1:43:45] <Bailey__gaming> Fun Fact if you want to write the year in roman numerals. it's MMXVIII
[1:43:59] <MrPedrovsky> I guess some people love this old game but to be honest this game is quite boring at least @peachsaliva makes it better
[1:44:02] <%Hapsam> "this is my friend, plague"
[1:44:11] <Eresus> @PeachSaliva have you thought of streaming Chrono Trigger?
[1:44:28] <+Mekhet09> Do chrono cross.
[1:44:29] <shadic7700> man those dot dot dots are sexually charged
[1:44:35] <element_of_loyalty> !!
[1:44:44] <jeecay> is he about to get jumped in a hotel?
[1:44:47] <captainthunderwolf> I'm honestly in this weird place where I just assume Plague is the proper name to use because he's straightforward enough to insist that people use his name, but sardonic enough that even feigning familiarity feels risky.
[1:44:49] <element_of_loyalty> HE'S SO SMALL :D
[1:44:52] <%Hapsam> what the hell, why are they so large
[1:44:53] <+E_Darkness> whoops, accidentally killing your people
[1:44:55] <%AbnormalVoid> ewwww
[1:44:56] <$MattyPOnTheRoad> @peachsaliva hit me up too, we still have that fight game in development, just slow going
[1:44:57] <roburabu> look how tiny he is compared to the officers
[1:44:57] <bleugh> his name is seashell?
[1:44:59] <Yukisoda> Love that SNES FF music
[1:45:00] <zal_silverfang> so, how did they find out he was there and hiding the girl?
[1:45:03] <duke0fspook> WHY WOULD YOU LOVE TO DO THAT
[1:45:06] <muniea0> do Terranigma.
[1:45:10] <theo_marks> oooo
[1:45:15] <+TsundereHunter> Old games had ovesized boss sprites for detail reasons
[1:45:16] <SuperNotSuspiciousMan> Fun fact: Romans used Arabic numbers later when doing equations for building measurements because FUCK doing equations with roman numerals.
[1:45:20] <+Bonkasaurusrex> Why would you make Pat suffer like that?
[1:45:21] <doofmaster> doesn't Pat hate that game?
[1:45:32] <xeros720> hehe yeah, he loathes chrono cross
[1:45:37] <theo_marks> for da stream funsies
[1:45:37] <hntronium> Pat hates the game
[1:45:38] <Bailey__gaming> @PeachSaliva I asked you on twitter the other day but what did you think of the Happy time Murders in the end?
[1:45:41] <+aversal_ammar> The hotel guy was in on it
[1:45:45] <+JenovasPuppet> Play Chaos Legion
[1:45:45] <MarylandJutsu> BIG PAT SUFFERING
[1:45:45] <Chocolatevgz> IT's truel love
[1:45:45] <roburabu> terranigma would be nice
[1:45:51] <duke0fspook> Why you make yourself suffer like that
[1:45:52] <hntronium> I too hate the game as a sequel to Trigger
[1:45:57] <MrPedrovsky> Wait @peachsaliva aren’t they supposed be human? Why are they hella big?
[1:45:57] <frenchfryfist> it makes paige stronger
[1:45:59] <element_of_loyalty> MURDER
[1:45:59] <$MattyPOnTheRoad> @aversal_ammar SPOILERS MUCH!?!?
[1:46:00] <+Mekhet09> It's a good game on it's own.
[1:46:02] <+linSP> how come these guys so big and sea seal is so small
[1:46:04] <CurrySauseBandit> Denied exp! SwiftRage
[1:46:08] <escourtmission> Happy Time Murders looks like garbage judging from the trailers.
[1:46:13] <element_of_loyalty> Now Kiss
[1:46:14] <captainthunderwolf> @SuperNotSuspiciousMan Yeah man, we stole their letters and also the Greek gods and then later on that other god on the cross, because Italians are born with thievery in our blood.
[1:46:18] <+aversal_ammar> @mattypontheroad I’ve never played ffiv tho
[1:46:22] <@WoolyFish> It's a strong 4/10
[1:46:38] <duke0fspook> Like that
[1:46:42] <duke0fspook> The little girl voice is gone
[1:46:43] <$LocDogX86X> I liked "The Happytime Murders"
[1:46:46] <zal_silverfang> I expected it to be a knock off of "Who Framed Rodger Rabbit"
[1:46:49] <%umbypokochan> i love that voice for Rydia
[1:46:50] <$MattyPOnTheRoad> @aversal_ammar i thought it was a happy time murder spoil. you good
[1:46:52] <element_of_loyalty> Pedo Bear
[1:46:55] <Prevot> Caller? I barely know her!
[1:46:55] <Gnapalm> PROFESSIONAL VA PAIGE
[1:46:56] <@WoolyFish> Why is she doing a bad hentai dub voice?
[1:46:58] <Mr_Strut> She's no Celes
[1:46:59] <MarylandJutsu> RYDIA BEST GIRLL
[1:47:00] <%umbypokochan> MOG IS BEST
[1:47:02] <+TheGreatBamBe> Rydia or Lydia is the real quesion
[1:47:02] <+HoloToast> Geralt of Rydia
[1:47:05] <%AbnormalVoid> you finally got the call girl
[1:47:05] <%Gogogolem> I just meet you and this is crazy. But caller Ridia.
[1:47:05] <frenchfryfist> i expected trash
[1:47:07] <$mandragoraroot> WutFace
[1:47:07] <captainthunderwolf> Given that her name is "Rydia", I'm surprised her name isn't "Carl Rydia".
[1:47:09] <Eresus> @hntronium even if it wasn't a sequel to trigger, I still think the characters in Cross are garbage with next to none development
[1:47:17] <jeecay> where was that desk guy when cecil got jumped in his hotel?
[1:47:23] <reonome> Clam Rydia
[1:47:24] <Bailey__gaming> @PeachSaliva what was your group's reaction to Sandra's 1st outfit with the glasses and sensible clothes?
[1:47:28] <duke0fspook> Mog is best girl
[1:47:31] <@PinkieTheEerie> yea she is....well cluimsey
[1:47:34] <@PinkieTheEerie> AND unlucky
[1:47:37] <zal_silverfang> @WoolyFish is there a GOOD hentai dub voice?
[1:47:38] <@PinkieTheEerie> a AMAZEING combo!
[1:47:44] <+JenovasPuppet> They just slept right over the corpses of the captain and his men
[1:47:56] <element_of_loyalty> :D
[1:47:57] <Bailey__gaming> @PeachSaliva i went with my friend who also watches you and she was like ITS PAIGE really loudly
[1:48:17] <SuperNotSuspiciousMan> @captainthunderwolf instead of thievery I would call it "efficient cultural appropriation"
[1:48:18] <@PinkieTheEerie> shes doing better NOW.
[1:48:23] <jeecay> everyone in this Inn moonwalks :P
[1:48:23] <MrPedrovsky> I’m confused why these thugs were like 20 time bigger than paige? Aren’t they supposed be human or they just morph when plot demands it???
[1:48:25] <@PinkieTheEerie> its just she has YOUR health luck
[1:48:28] <element_of_loyalty> Yay Pinkie
[1:48:38] <bleugh> tellah bout tellah
[1:48:45] <Chocolatevgz> Daaam, Cyan
[1:48:46] <duke0fspook> I
[1:48:46] <%umbypokochan> @MrPedrovsky have you played Octopath Traveller? It's literally 10 times worse
[1:48:49] <+TsundereHunter> Cave Antlion sounds safe
[1:48:49] <+Mekhet09> Man, I hate that future versions of this game saves the characters making their sacrifices pointless.
[1:48:54] <%Keyd00d> some say Damkosm
[1:48:55] <duke0fspook> Who would say that
[1:48:59] <arcaderabbit48> Damn, Cyan!
[1:49:00] <$mandragoraroot> da monstars
[1:49:05] <Milo_san> damn blues
[1:49:09] <Chocolatevgz> @Mekhet09 I also hated that lol
[1:49:12] <$MattyPOnTheRoad> OK HOLD UP! @peachsaliva in a game with such a square aspect ratio and low resolution, is it really necessary to have rhe unused left third of your face cam blocking the hot pixelated action?!?!
[1:49:14] <+TsundereHunter> lolwut
[1:49:15] <Eresus> @MrPedrovsky because enemies are static images, while you characters have battle anmations, so their sprites need to be smaller
[1:49:16] <duke0fspook> Those people, much like the people who say Kosm, are wrong
[1:49:21] <Chocolatevgz> Just like when Search for Spock did it, goddammit
[1:49:24] <element_of_loyalty> BLIND
[1:49:26] <MrPedrovsky> @umbypokochan no I didn’t nintendo switch is expensive around here
[1:49:28] <Eresus> @MrPedrovsky hardware limations
[1:49:28] <hntronium> I dont understand what that line means
[1:49:40] <Spydurman> yes
[1:49:45] <MrPedrovsky> @eresus thanks
[1:49:45] <element_of_loyalty> :D
[1:49:47] <Spydurman> no it's not in the way
[1:49:47] <reonome> a bit
[1:49:48] <%Keyd00d> they were falling when they picked her up?
[1:49:48] <SuperNotSuspiciousMan> Fell down eh? not smacked via fight?
[1:49:49] <%umbypokochan> @MrPedrovsky oh, well the bosses are often regular people but they fill practically the whole screen lol
[1:49:49] <+dansinginthestreet> Not particularly
[1:49:50] <+YabbaTroll> he has a point
[1:49:50] <reonome> its fine though
[1:49:51] <duke0fspook> I man
[1:49:51] <hntronium> Bottom right corner
[1:49:52] <@thenefftw> It's fine
[1:49:54] <$mandragoraroot> a little bit
[1:49:54] <duke0fspook> Kind of, but it's fine
[1:49:58] <StencilOST> its fine
[1:49:58] <+havelock065> not really
[1:49:58] <%Wallabri> it's fine
[1:49:59] <%Remery_> a little bit
[1:50:01] <+JenovasPuppet> Don't adjust! You'll kill it all!
[1:50:01] <+dansinginthestreet> but you could put facecam under the game and lose no real estate in either area
[1:50:02] <jeecay> it's fine
[1:50:03] <+YabbaTroll> lotta wasted space full of backness
[1:50:04] <emillionghost> no. he has a point but this is still good
[1:50:04] <%TheGershon> you could still make it show the whole screen as well as you
[1:50:05] <+Superstarsage> No more than usual. But i mean you can move the game window to the left and fix that entirely
[1:50:06] <Yukisoda> It's not even close to blocking anything
[1:50:07] <element_of_loyalty> We can't see Steve
[1:50:09] <arcaderabbit48> He's joking, its fine, please for the love of god dont mess with settings again we dont want to die
[1:50:11] <+TsundereHunter> it would be too much effort to fix
[1:50:13] <+Ches_Neckbeard> yall complaining about getting that hot bathroom door action in the corner there
[1:50:15] <stovetopism> Its literally a nothing problem
[1:50:17] <theo_marks> nah its all good
[1:50:19] <+bantypants> cheer600
[1:50:21] <Luesagna00> @peachsaliva your right side is like nonpeach space
[1:50:25] <MrPedrovsky> @umbypokochan so like all these really old games were like that?
[1:50:28] <duke0fspook> You might break something if you try, so better not
[1:50:30] <%umbypokochan> rename everyone!!
[1:50:33] <jeecay> that school looked like a casino for a second
[1:50:39] <$MattyPOnTheRoad> it really is fine, just being a twat. it is unnecessary though, js
[1:50:42] <captainthunderwolf> Namingway was born to ask people if they want to change their names.
[1:50:43] <%AbnormalVoid> Name Cid "Pat"
[1:50:44] <SailingSaturn> Man that class has treadmills at their desks cirTan
[1:50:46] <element_of_loyalty> Change Name tpo Pacifica NorthWest

[1:52:34] <MrPedrovsky> @umbypokochan also no reason for me to get switch since i have never touched anything even remotely Nintendo related
[1:52:52] <duke0fspook> @Gravity_Gunner This time it was breaking things
[1:52:52] <+JenovasPuppet> DANCING1

[1:53:33] <arcaderabbit48> This is how Peach dances. Throwing herself in the water and flailing as she drowns
[1:53:39] <+Gravity_Gunner> @thegershon Okay, fair enough. But that’s what it’s there for, as a fallback option when game capture doesn’t work.
[1:53:40] <Yukisoda> Well at least someone got wet from that

[1:55:58] <+AntithesisEK> someone draw up Oh mister Cecil asap
[1:55:59] <SuperNotSuspiciousMan> ANT-LION????that is the first time I've heard that pronounced that way

[1:56:33] <+Oak_bogle> Thanks for using see soul the real name and not ces ol
[1:56:35] <Eresus> @rcand9 the plot sickness is too strong
[1:56:36] <%umbypokochan> you gotta go to the cave
[1:56:38] <+thedannydarko> Daytime Peach is best surprise.
[1:56:42] <duke0fspook> @jetrouverai Says you
[1:56:45] <%umbypokochan> but grind with rydia first
[1:56:53] <+AntithesisEK> esunaga might though
[1:56:57] <element_of_loyalty> RAISE YA HANDS IN THE AIR
[1:56:59] <captainthunderwolf> @jetrouverai Amazingly, the spell was made specifically with not curing syphilis in mind.
[1:57:05] <%umbypokochan> @PeachSaliva you can use the rod as an item in battle for more damage
[1:57:05] <SuperNotSuspiciousMan> @Gravity_Gunner it's been an age and barely remember anything
[1:57:06] <Bonbie> Why is she doing that
[1:57:13] <+TsundereHunter> DANCING
[1:57:16] <xeros720> if i remember, Rydia has crap mp and can't summon anything, so the bow might be better
[1:57:27] <transmithim> I think you went with the wrong pronunciation of Cecil. Cee-cil just sounds weird.
[1:57:30] <$MattyPOnTheRoad> 220 GigaPytes is impressive for 1991
[1:57:37] <Chocolatevgz> Bow is for whoever yea
[1:57:40] <%lancebigg3rstaff> cheer300 Remember to stay big and strong with huge junk
[1:57:49] <+rcand9> whips a cool tho
[1:57:52] <+Gravity_Gunner> @supernotsuspiciousman There are overgrown alien insects called Antlions in the game and it’s pronounced Ant Lion throughout
[1:57:52] <element_of_loyalty> HUGH JUNK
[1:57:56] <Chocolatevgz> SEA SILL
[1:57:57] <+CJett92> No way, it's see-sil
[1:57:59] <Chocolatevgz> Both work, meh
[1:58:06] <duke0fspook> Sessil is british, Cecil is american
[1:58:07] <$MattyPOnTheRoad> @transmithim but that's how you can say Cedric
[1:58:09] <aeravon> <3 paige <3 ff4
[1:58:11] <BourneWarrior> SEESIL
[1:58:15] <Yukisoda> As long as it's not Ses-sil
[1:58:18] <+rcand9> cecil sesil both are right
[1:58:22] <transmithim> Regional difference thing.
[1:58:26] <+E_Darkness> DUBS SAY SEESIL
[1:58:28] <Luesagna00> "KAY-Kil" is how ya pronounce cecil
[1:58:29] <element_of_loyalty> ....thing
[1:58:33] <Chocolatevgz> Sussil
[1:58:35] <+AntithesisEK> LUL @Luesagna00
[1:58:36] <%MightyMaxT> Dissidia says Sess-ill
[1:58:37] <SuperNotSuspiciousMan> @Gravity_Gunner going to play it again just to hear that
[1:58:38] <frenchfryfist> kekil
[1:58:38] <+DeadlyToastY> man I always remembered Cecil as Cedric for some reason
[1:58:39] <%umbypokochan> @PeachSaliva give her the rod and then use it as item in battle to do more damage
[1:58:42] <$Agami23> in the DS game, she gets a dumb moogle thing
[1:58:42] <xeros720> gascoin is the proper way
[1:58:42] <reonome> cecilia
[1:58:44] <chocobodundee> what are we gonna call him TEEDUS
[1:58:46] <+CJett92> It's suh-SEAL
[1:58:47] <captainthunderwolf> Sessile is a word, you can't name a man after a word.
[1:58:48] <%TrevyWeaponsGuy> What kind of maniac pronounces it Sessil
[1:58:50] <Gnapalm> sea salt
[1:58:50] <$MattyPOnTheRoad> you're name suggests you're all about choice and personal preference
[1:58:51] <TomCrimson> @Luesagna00 exactly. Now nobody wins
[1:58:52] <+rcand9> spicy sesil
[1:58:53] <hntronium> I know a Cecil pronounced as sessil
[1:58:54] <captainthunderwolf> See-sill is obviously superior.
[1:58:55] <Eresus> FF4 DS and Dissidia have voice acting, so there is an official way of pronuncing Cecil
[1:58:57] <themagic_conch> The correct pronunciation is aotan
[1:58:57] <element_of_loyalty> PAT IS RIGHT
[1:59:00] <+Cosairen> VoHiYo
[1:59:03] <aeravon> sess-ill is the pronounciation they had in the voice acting for the DS version. But I ignore that anyway
[1:59:04] <Dovakhin573> Pat is wrong
[1:59:05] <BourneWarrior> Its Pronounced GASKWANG you Dingus
[1:59:12] <+CJett92> It's pronounced Gatsu
[1:59:20] <hntronium> Is Paige just being gaskwanged
[1:59:21] <+Cosairen> best final fantasy
[1:59:22] <%umbypokochan> use the imp spell!!!!!!
[1:59:22] <frenchfryfist> Gattz
[1:59:25] <xeros720> a sort inventory button? man i wish
[1:59:25] <$MattyPOnTheRoad> @bournewarrior BAAAAHAHAHAHAHHS
[1:59:28] <%furiousfurioso> rooComfy
[1:59:29] <element_of_loyalty> LUL
[1:59:31] <+rcand9> gas cio ne Kappa
[1:59:34] <%umbypokochan> @PeachSaliva use the imp spell
[1:59:37] <fingalights> the very bottom i think
[1:59:40] <captainthunderwolf> Reading old Berserk scans and seeing it translated as Gatsu is what it means to know that not everyone is worth saving.
[1:59:41] <nexoosen> Guts?
[1:59:42] <@WoolyFish> Is she just going to shoot chunks of iron with her bow?
[1:59:46] <Dovakhin573> Seriously Gatsu sounds lamer than Guts how will you dirrespect that man like that
[1:59:47] <element_of_loyalty> RE4 conbine
[1:59:56] <%Remery_> Small girl can fight?
[1:59:59] <$MattyPOnTheRoad> is this Snailborne?
[2:00:00] <Animeshowfan> just thorw the iron with her stand
[2:00:01] <Chocolatevgz> might be a sort button at the bottom of the item list
[2:00:01] <Dovakhin573> Guts dosent need any more shit
[2:00:02] <%umbypokochan> yay! a useless spell! XD
[2:00:04] <%MightyMaxT> Y'know what. Yeah, Seas-sill is good. I refuse Tee-dus as the correct pronunciation so Dissidia isn't the be-all, end-all
[2:00:08] <+AntithesisEK> slinging raw ore sounds pretty effective to be honest
[2:00:15] <+Skatedeandre> GATSU?
[2:00:19] <+rcand9> sort your attache case pat
[2:00:21] <transmithim> I’m saying it has hard Cs. Kekil. It’s fantasy, let’s be constrained by real world names.
[2:00:29] <xeros720> honestly, she could fling potions and that'd make her more than useful
[2:00:35] <captainthunderwolf> "Slinging raw ore" is like the most graphic depiction of ejaculation I've ever witnessed spoken.
[2:00:35] <BourneWarrior> GANTZ?
[2:00:40] <element_of_loyalty> TWO SLEEPING BAGS
[2:00:51] <jeecay> do do do do you have it? GUTS!
[2:00:53] <%oddslogic> 99 arrows
[2:01:02] <SGrim> I like how Cecil leaves town and grows to several dozen meters in height. He's a very considerate giant for not stomping on their town like that. rooPog
[2:01:14] <element_of_loyalty> :D
[2:01:14] <$iwishthiswasicq> Oh my god it's happening.
[2:01:18] <%theemperorseyebrows> GATTSU DE GATTSUN GATTSUN DA
[2:01:23] <%theemperorseyebrows> for all 3 people who get that
[2:01:25] <%umbypokochan> @PeachSaliva give Rydia the rod and you can use it as item in battle! it does decent damage! sipsipHonk sipsipHonk sipsipHonk sipsipHonk sipsipHonk
[2:01:28] <$mandragoraroot> SourPls
[2:01:31] <captainthunderwolf> Griffisu is also the worst.
[2:01:31] <$MattyPOnTheRoad> @peachsaliva is it pronounced peeCh or PEE-ATCH?
[2:01:41] <+rcand9> cecil can pitch a tent in full armor? Kappa
[2:01:42] <jeecay> Those mermen got swag. Look at how their standing
[2:01:45] <element_of_loyalty> New people missed PEachs two hours of reboot n fix srtream
[2:01:47] <Animeshowfan> oh shit those fish men are about to pull the hardest breakdance in history
[2:01:50] <hntronium> I remember playing this and having no idea what I was doing
[2:01:52] <+boomstickery> bigger staff is better staff
[2:01:56] <captainthunderwolf> Griffith is an ENGLISH NAME, YOU MADMEN.

[2:03:09] <+AntithesisEK> sahuagin living in the desert is genuinely impressed
[2:03:11] <+Hazencruz> is this terraria?
[2:03:19] <%Remery_> At Work
[2:03:20] <NopeBadguy> They're probably at the office
[2:03:20] <jeecay> Do muppets sleep?
[2:03:21] <frenchfryfist> ye
[2:03:21] <%umbypokochan> my favorite thing to do with Rydia is kill off everyone but her and just grind her to like 30 before everyone falls in the ocean, then she comes back super strong for Golbez fight
[2:03:26] <$SweetCheeksTrap> They're doing serious business things!
[2:03:34] <Chocolatevgz> they're having chewie and fuckface time
[2:03:35] <hntronium> Oh no, Pat's doing more Banner Saga
[2:03:36] <+Cosairen> god this makes me want an octopath style remake for 4
[2:03:36] <duke0fspook> Probably doing like, a one off and also more of that game
[2:03:40] <captainthunderwolf> @Dovakhin573 I agree, but anyone who tells me to call it Ghost Fight instead of Yu Yu Hakusho is getting punched in the throat a few times.
[2:03:43] <hntronium> I feel a pain in my side
[2:03:49] <Animeshowfan> the enemy desgins in this game are pretty cool. i love the colors of them and they have a fun desgin to them
[2:03:50] <$MattyPOnTheRoad> @peachsaliva why don't the mean men let you round out the 4 player fisticuffs? are they intimidated by how big and strong you're dick is?
[2:03:52] <captainthunderwolf> @Dovakhin573 Ghost Fight*, sorry.
[2:03:52] <+rcand9> quick pats away touch his stuff!
[2:03:59] <captainthunderwolf> FIGHTER, not FIGHT.
[2:04:00] <captainthunderwolf> Damn.
[2:04:03] <element_of_loyalty> Raise yer hands if you're sure Girl
[2:04:11] <+cylish> .....why are there mermen in the desert?
[2:04:14] <Dovakhin573> @captainthunderwolf I thought it was ghost files Kappa
[2:04:16] <+AntithesisEK> @Hazencruz you've called out to me because my Summoner uses a rydia vanity and my melee character is a Dragoon.
[2:04:20] <+rcand9> change his brightness
[2:04:20] <%umbypokochan> oh my god she's using potions
[2:04:21] <+LiveStreamOnyx> FFFacts: Cecil English VA is good ol Yuri Lowenthal

[2:04:49] <$iwishthiswasicq> The remake of this game for DS was fucking baller.
[2:04:54] <SuperNotSuspiciousMan> Anyone here watching the Banner Saga LP? how is it? I saw the first episodes but woolie and pat overthinking just drains me
[2:04:56] <captainthunderwolf> @Dovakhin573 I can think of several bones you can survive indefinitely without, my dude. Tempt me not. Also, like actually, goodonya for knowing one of the other half-dozen names it had.
[2:04:57] <+Hazencruz> LMFAO
[2:05:04] <%FaultyJawa> she hears and then she uses the sight
[2:05:05] <jeecay> swag ass mermen are back

[2:05:12] <+CJett92> Comb the desert!
[2:05:13] <%umbypokochan> didn't see my advice about the rod, but she sees me make fun her use of potions :(
[2:05:13] <element_of_loyalty> :O Peach didn't kill the girl?!
[2:05:15] <captainthunderwolf> @SuperNotSuspiciousMan Funny, but if you've played, their performance can be bothersome.
[2:05:19] <xeros720> back to town first i guess
[2:05:19] <hntronium> @SuperNotSuspiciousMan Pat's not playing well. Watch it for hum fucking up
[2:05:25] <+Cosairen> @SuperNotSuspiciousMan woolie isnt backseating as much as he was before
[2:05:27] <Dovakhin573> @captainthunderwolf Lol
[2:05:36] <$MattyPOnTheRoad> @cjett92 we ain't found s**t

[2:05:49] <element_of_loyalty> Checker Magic
[2:05:50] <SuperNotSuspiciousMan> I'll give it a shot then now knowing what to expect. thanks guys
[2:05:50] <%AbnormalVoid> :fire:
[2:05:51] <+MisterCrimson> also, you can use the Rod as an item to deal damage
[2:05:51] <+Cosairen> dab alert
[2:05:53] <hntronium> Rydia is both black and white? Does that mean she's biracial?
[2:05:53] <theo_marks> L I T

[2:06:05] <SulfurousAcid> go to inn
[2:06:06] <captainthunderwolf> Using white and black magic is how you create WoolieVS from the nothingness of the backlog.

[2:06:20] <+Hazencruz> that cave looks like a stretched out anus

[2:07:24] <+Hazencruz> ITS LIT FAM
[2:07:24] <jeecay> the mushrooms are guarding the sacred breakfast
[2:07:29] <captainthunderwolf> You guys ever think about how, ironically, Marlow Briggs seems less racist than he would if he were a straight-up Dante-style fighter guy, specifically because he uses weird, vaguely racist Aztec murder scythes?
[2:07:34] <$GohanEgret> @jeecay it's a picnic spread
[2:07:47] <element_of_loyalty> fade away
[2:07:47] <emillionghost> this music is good
[2:07:51] <TerraWraith> Ooh, so we already killed the mom?
[2:07:52] <captainthunderwolf> It's like the racism neutralizes itself in specific dosages.
[2:07:53] <%umbypokochan> you should play this 2 player with Pat
[2:07:53] <+Hazencruz> old game music is ba
[2:07:54] <+Hazencruz> bae
[2:07:58] <element_of_loyalty> WHERE DA FOO AT?
[2:07:58] <jeecay> The picnic spread escaped
[2:07:58] <Luesagna00> !uptime
[2:07:59] <%umbypokochan> then you can kill each other
[2:07:59] <transmithim> Lit as in Literature? She pulling out some Shakespeare?
[2:08:00] <SulfurousAcid> did she go to the inn to refill hp and mp?
[2:08:03] <TerraWraith> Damn, i missed more women murder
[2:08:03] <duke0fspook> No I have never thought about that
[2:08:12] <$SweetCheeksTrap> @PeachSaliva You should say "illuminated" instead of lit, just for funsies.
[2:08:15] <+AntithesisEK> can't wait for the other boss theme
[2:08:16] <AxelssonOnFire> When's Portal?
[2:08:20] <+Cosairen> @transmithim lightning unfortunately

[2:08:54] <+MisterCrimson> Rydia is great, but she is technically worse than Palom as a black mage
[2:08:56] <$Agami23> i thought lit was fire. i dont know why
[2:08:58] <AxelssonOnFire> Here comes the Wc
[2:09:03] <+Hazencruz> dragon's dogma needs a sequel
[2:09:03] <$GohanEgret> the wcdonalds hath traveled many passages to reach this faraway land
[2:09:04] <$LocDogX86X> Social eating time
[2:09:05] <+Hazencruz> not that online thing
[2:09:06] <HorribleHog> I do love an comfy stream though
[2:09:08] <element_of_loyalty> SMOOCH THE DELIVERY GAL
[2:09:09] <jeecay> CAUSE THIS IS THRILLER!
[2:09:10] <transmithim> @Cosairen litning then?
[2:09:10] <captainthunderwolf> You know, you could totally use a Portal gun to punch yourself in the face.
[2:09:13] <%umbypokochan> if only she wasn't scared of fire
[2:09:14] <+xxviios> Wow this encounter rate
[2:09:14] <hntronium> Your food isn't there. He stopped at your door and then went back because you weren't responding.
[2:09:23] <+Hazencruz> cure doesn't hurt undead in FFIV?
[2:09:28] <%AbnormalVoid> apatBig damage Kappa
[2:09:31] <+MisterCrimson> I can't believe you've done this
[2:09:32] <+Hazencruz> holy or fire
[2:09:36] <%AbnormalVoid> it does, it just did shit lol
[2:09:38] <+AntithesisEK> I think it does
[2:09:42] <+Hazencruz> fuck
[2:09:46] <element_of_loyalty> CurseLit
[2:09:49] <$Agami23> it hurts undead, its just that its too weak to do alot of damage. because rydia is smol and weka
[2:09:58] <+Hazencruz> FOO-YA
[2:09:59] <Eresus> Fire PTSD
[2:10:00] <%umbypokochan> i'm pretty sure the rod would help with this
[2:10:01] <TheImmortal70> It does you’re just barely doing any damage
[2:10:06] <xeros720> oh yeah, that's a big plot point
[2:10:09] <+cylish> CAST CURE ON THEN WOMAN
[2:10:12] <$GohanEgret> why does rydia constantly stare at the camera
[2:10:16] <jeecay> those are some tough zombies
[2:10:20] <jeecay> they must be fresh
[2:10:21] <BourneWarrior> Big LIT
[2:10:24] <+Hazencruz> rydia is freakazoid confirmed
[2:10:25] <%AbnormalVoid> give her your rod
[2:10:26] <inz0mbiac> this is something weird. Why does the first game have an offensive spell for white magic to hurt undead but you never see it come back?
[2:10:27] <element_of_loyalty> ZEDS BE GONE
[2:10:36] <SulfurousAcid> it did about as much damage as any other spell
[2:10:37] <+MisterCrimson> single target. anytime you use multi target it divides by 4
[2:10:39] <%umbypokochan> poor Cecil can't do shit
[2:10:40] <+AntithesisEK> zombambos
[2:10:46] <arcaderabbit48> @PeachSaliva Cecil's dark swords deal Dark damage, which undead are heavily resistant to
[2:10:46] <captainthunderwolf> Speaking of, I'm actually super disappointed that the guys missed out on the Varl lore in the Banner Saga LP. The Varl are super cool and they missed like the one cool godstone that explains them.
[2:10:48] <hntronium> I think Lightning did more damage
[2:10:50] <%HoldBtoRun> single target cure
[2:10:53] <element_of_loyalty> Elmo get the door
[2:10:54] <+cylish> MY BAD.
[2:10:59] <TheImmortal70> Why are these guys so damn strong
[2:10:59] <+xxviios> Theres a lot of FF where cure hurts undead
[2:11:00] <+MisterCrimson> item
[2:11:02] <jeecay> give her the rod
[2:11:04] <%umbypokochan> i dunno if you can do it in battle
[2:11:05] <+JenovasPuppet> You gotta woo her first
[2:11:07] <+Hazencruz> CHOKE ON MY ROD!
[2:11:08] <hntronium> Just click on it

[2:11:14] <+MisterCrimson> then double click
[2:11:15] <SulfurousAcid> ATB
[2:11:15] <element_of_loyalty> Get her drunk before giving rod
[2:11:16] <jeecay> slinging rod
[2:11:16] <TerraWraith> I'm not super sure you can equip items during a battle
[2:11:18] <+CJett92> aww ya, give her dat big rod
[2:11:19] <%AbnormalVoid> move it up to the top
[2:11:19] <%umbypokochan> you have to have it equipped
[2:11:19] <Eresus> @inz0mbiac there are a lot of small details through out the franchise that change
[2:11:20] <Worldbrand> Man this is one cozy ass afternoon strim
[2:11:22] <+AntithesisEK> i think that's just shifting
[2:11:30] <%umbypokochan> move all the way up
[2:11:35] <Yukisoda> Uh oh
[2:11:35] <+MisterCrimson> she has to be holding it
[2:11:38] <xeros720> drag it up to the top? i know you can do that in 6
[2:11:39] <AxelssonOnFire> please stream bloons tower defense queen
[2:11:39] <$GohanEgret> clipped
[2:11:46] <@PlagueOfGripes> too scary for paige

[2:11:50] <+Cosairen> its ok paige im a coward too
[2:11:51] <SulfurousAcid> go back to inn if no tents
[2:11:55] <captainthunderwolf> The really embarrassing part of this fight is that all of those zombies showed up in the same outfit.
[2:11:55] <element_of_loyalty> LEWD
[2:12:00] <+MisterCrimson> rods don't break in this game
[2:12:00] <+AntithesisEK> streamer exposed by shambling band of zombambos
[2:12:03] <applesonthemoon> being a coward is the name of the game innit?

[2:36:21] <SulfurousAcid> outgoing shy
[2:36:21] <SuperNotSuspiciousMan> GOOD. people with phases in college.... always see them in their last years going "why did I even"
[2:36:24] <Deekman> I get that. I'm loud as fuck to cover up the shyness

[2:36:36] <ToneBacas> shy people don't just share their social security number

[2:42:38] <@WoolyFish> "I don't like dirty laundry" she said, having a pile of dirty laundry in her room.
[2:42:41] <+Envisage> Since we're speaking of theories and fanfictions, i've often wondered how the world would look if Paige and Crymetina were the founders if SBFP (kind of an embarrassing thought i know)

[2:47:12] <TheBlackMandalorian> Are you intrested in the MMO genre like World of warcraft ff14 those types of games.

[2:47:57] <Rellim80> @PeachSaliva Do you call Elmo PP because of (P)at & (P)aige?
[2:47:58] <Zaktheaussie> was the nightmare that pat got tall?
[2:47:59] <Iplatypusprime> OSCAR THE TRASH CAT
[2:48:01] <duke0fspook> Also he came from a dumpster
[2:48:02] <jeecay> because pat is the grouch in that house
[2:48:03] <+Mekhet09> So like why do you treat portal like bloodborne? If you took a minute and looked around you'd be in a better state than stumbling around.
[2:48:04] <stovetopism> @teethmuncher took a break to eat
[2:48:06] <jinkipng> so few people during the day
[2:48:12] <element_of_loyalty> Elmo the dumpster baby
[2:48:12] <@WoolyFish> A stampede of children hopped up on redbull scream past my house every morning, it's awful.
[2:48:16] <Prevot> I was wondering where the eating part had gone
[2:48:18] <PeteyMcPickle> I imagine they'd wind up with a load of Oscars is they named all of the dumpster cats after oscar
[2:48:20] <Rezroc> THATS WHY PAT LIKES ELMO OMG IT MAKES SENSE NOW
[2:48:21] <grayjammer> I mean Elmo went to Grouchland once...
[2:48:22] <jeecay> also pat is the only muppet present
[2:48:24] <%umbypokochan> how can Elmo be real if our eyes aren't real?

[3:06:50] <jeecay> My reflection scares me. I understand completely
[3:06:50] <%Hilleltaco> I'm guessing the title screen says II because of weird localization stuff? Like, other games hadn't come here so they just called it 2?
[3:06:54] <ElMangoes> cantaLurk
[3:06:58] <tacostarvedbeast> It’s not a race Eli lol
[3:06:58] <thewhiteworm> No you don't

[3:07:15] <Invisoguy> kablamz
[3:07:16] <duke0fspook> MOVE THE MOUSE
[3:07:17] <+JenovasPuppet> You accidentally changed the title to Dragon's Dogma. It would probably be easier to switch to that game than change the stream title.
[3:07:18] <Invisoguy> everything seems good
[3:07:19] <jeecay> she did it!
[3:07:20] <Ell1ot> the Paige dimension is infinite

[3:14:45] <duke0fspook> ADD is not a real thing
[3:14:47] <+rcand9> when i had the ds version i had no idea it was tougher
[3:14:51] <duke0fspook> ADHD is
[3:14:52] <element_of_loyalty> Autism is real
[3:14:55] <SuperNotSuspiciousMan> skipped the H
[3:14:59] <+E_Darkness> I thought if we wanted to roast a girl, you get her from both ends
[3:14:59] <+Punisher7771> her clothes
[3:15:00] <%TrevyWeaponsGuy> Salt a lady
[3:15:04] <+Ondartyr> Her boots
[3:15:04] <Ell1ot> i thought you needed two guys to roast a girl
[3:15:06] <%umbypokochan> the real way to roast a girl is something you can't say on stream because wow too dirty
[3:15:09] <+TheRussianWinter> @peachsaliva do you think you’ll ever play earthbound on stream
[3:15:10] <duke0fspook> Insult her boots
[3:15:12] <+MechaBaphomet> Talk shit about her boots
[3:15:13] <TerraWraith> Boots smell, hope you fail

[3:15:15] <element_of_loyalty> Your boots stink
[3:15:15] <Eresus> the boots are the weak spot
[3:15:17] <%TrevyWeaponsGuy> "Those shoes with that tie? Fuck outta here with that, Brenda."
[3:15:17] <duke0fspook> The boots are uggo @PeachSaliva

[3:15:17] <+JenovasPuppet> "Your pores are so cute!" "YOU CAN SEE MY PORES!?"
[3:15:24] <+rcand9> insult her foreskin Kappa
[3:15:26] <@WoolyFish> If you really want to roast Paige just tell her you laughed when she had to kill Papyrus.
[3:15:26] <Spydurman> is that why you're so defensive of your boots haha
[3:15:27] <%rdark_ksu> or make her aware she is no lady at all
[3:15:32] <+Sylpphire> Partially true
[3:15:36] <element_of_loyalty> FUCK YO BOOTS
[3:15:51] <jeecay> @JenovasPuppet "MY PORES ARE CUTE MY PORES ARE TINY! YOU'RE FIRED"
[3:15:54] <Davifflaelan> @PeachSaliva I like your ugly boots
[3:15:55] <Ell1ot> Tellah showed that monster
[3:15:57] <%TheOnlyStrayCat> INSULT HER WHAT?!
[3:16:11] <Spydurman> the camera makes her 10 pounds blinder
[3:16:16] <+E_Darkness> I associate roasting with the other kind, this says a lot about me
[3:16:17] <%Remery_> Exaggerate the penis
[3:16:20] <+Sylpphire> lol wow

[3:16:43] <element_of_loyalty> Peach is 6-5 and Pat is 5-0

[3:17:56] <fairore> man legit sad i had to kill that guy in hollow knight

[3:29:55] <+Sylpphire> LUL
[3:29:57] <cptbellybutton352> sounded like a water fall
[3:30:00] <SGrim> Straight from peeing to eating. No hand washing needed. rooKek
[3:30:00] <%Tamamo_No_Mae_77> Know what wasn’t heard? A sink running

[3:30:06] <Rellim80> Hands!
[3:30:07] <duke0fspook> @WoolyFish Mission accomplished
[3:30:20] <@WoolyFish> Good work, everyone.
[3:30:26] <SuperNotSuspiciousMan> FF had some rough patches after IX
[3:30:30] <+meltdown547> Focused.
[3:30:33] <mistermastergreg> too much japanese drama
[3:30:34] <Ipsenscastle> IX peak story
[3:30:35] <%Sinister_Aglet> Paige have you played/heard of Lost Odyssey (the last classic FF)?
[3:30:42] <%Remery_> @WoolyFish we are easy to corrupt :)
[3:30:49] <%rdark_ksu> opinion on horseradish?
[3:30:49] <Smolkupo> @PeachSaliva Ughhhhh, are you one of THOSE people? Some of the newer FFs are good *eye roll*
[3:30:54] <+Sylpphire> I wanna say it's the modern JRPG tropes
[3:30:56] <@WoolyFish> You weren't invested in ff15 because you weren't playing.
[3:30:59] <+rcand9> eating on the toilet lowers charisma but buffs defenses
[3:30:59] <element_of_loyalty> Ether gets you high
[3:31:01] <$joylent_blue> but it needs this big complicated story line with the fal'cie and l'cie and the blah blah lobosK
[3:31:04] <@AngriestPat> they lack bad gameplay like ff4
[3:31:10] <+QuadraticGravity> LUL
[3:31:11] <KeiPrime> theres a guy named Edge he's got the most edge
[3:31:11] <cptbellybutton352> ill let you edge me paige
[3:31:11] <+Sylpphire> wow Pat
[3:31:13] <+jetrouverai> FUCK YOU PAT
[3:31:15] <$joylent_blue> WOW
[3:31:16] <SuperNotSuspiciousMan> I feel like XV brings it around though
[3:31:17] <+Sylpphire> talk shit harder, Pat
[3:31:19] <+JenovasPuppet> Got 'em
[3:31:19] <@AngriestPat> OHHH
[3:31:21] <+Vestillion> Modern Final fantasy is bloated
[3:31:21] <Ell1ot> i've played 7, 8, 9 , 10, 1, and 2 in that order and i've only finished 1 and 2
[3:31:24] <%Remery_> Pat is a mode O.O
[3:31:26] <element_of_loyalty> @AngriestPat :D
[3:31:28] <%Remery_> mod
[3:31:29] <+AntithesisEK> harsh and questionable attacks
[3:31:29] <mercado94> Pat telling the true
[3:31:30] <+skizzuto> objectively false, Pat
[3:31:30] <duke0fspook> PAT GET THE FUCK OUT
[3:31:31] <+DrThwack> ffxv had that stink of late stage capitalism
[3:31:32] <Worldbrand> I dunno, even having gone through 15 they do an okay job of warming you up to the main cast, but luna's characterization is lacking
[3:31:35] <+rcand9> edge is pretty edgey Kappa
[3:31:35] <SchroedingersFerret> We're having a proper roast now.
[3:31:39] <+Vestillion> overcomplicated, overvisualised tripe.
[3:31:42] <nexoosen> What about 13? everyones favourite!
[3:31:43] <element_of_loyalty> PATS RIGHT
[3:31:46] <emoonimoo> I really loved FF15 tbh, but I want to go back and try 13 again, because I don't really like Lightning. Terra is a MUCH better female protagonist than her, but that's just my opinion
[3:31:47] <Worldbrand> i cant wait for that gaem to be done
[3:31:49] <+Fenlig> Get back to work Pat
[3:31:49] <KeiPrime> destiny is destiny
[3:31:50] <@AngriestPat> I hate the band that you liiiiiike
[3:31:51] <heatrashes> get out pat
[3:31:52] <%TrevyWeaponsGuy> Hi Pat
[3:31:57] <reonome> fuck you pat
[3:31:57] <+Sylpphire> Pats right....game isn't good without edgy c*unts
[3:31:57] <Luesagna00> recent games more concern making as much money as possible, no heart.
[3:31:59] <Ipsenscastle> pat never met a bad opinion he didn't fall in love with
[3:32:00] <hntronium> FF4 is kind of clunky
[3:32:01] <tacostarvedbeast> @peachsaliva next thing ull tell me is you don’t like shadow the hedge horg
[3:32:02] <Mrbaconator> @AngriestPat are you guys gonna LP spiderman
[3:32:02] <Kaneis> I think FF4 has a lot of charm with the 'call' stuff
[3:32:03] <DedlokPM> @AngriestPat Did you see the clip I totally did not send you on twitter. teenJOY
[3:32:04] <Frade> yo AngriestPat
[3:32:04] <Ell1ot> how come Pat isn't working?
[3:32:04] <%TrevyWeaponsGuy> Stirring the shit pot I see
[3:32:05] <element_of_loyalty> HATE EVERYTHING PAT HATES
[3:32:05] <$Agami23> what about world of final fantasy?
[3:32:06] <SuperNotSuspiciousMan> she almost got tricked into touching your tv pat
[3:32:06] <Bailey__gaming> hi @angriestpat hope you are having fun recording 😊
[3:32:08] <duke0fspook> PAT GO AWAY
[3:32:10] <+Mister_Ari> Pat are you not subbed to your GF's channel???
[3:32:13] <reonome> THE ZAPPING SYSTEM SUCKS
[3:32:17] <violetheart> FF4 more like FF bore.
[3:32:17] <+BoboDaHobo> hot take, none of the final fantasy games have good gameplay
[3:32:18] <mr22apples> Pat come here forever
[3:32:19] <Ell1ot> Do your job, Pat!
[3:32:21] <%Remery_> The BOIVINn apatDab apatDab apatDab apatDab apatDab
[3:32:22] <@WoolyFish> Everyone is instantly riled up.
[3:32:23] <element_of_loyalty> @AngriestPat <3 <3
[3:32:24] <+JenovasPuppet> Clunked with love
[3:32:25] <+AntithesisEK> PROGENITOR
[3:32:29] <hntronium> Its clunky old spice
[3:32:30] <+DrThwack> ff4 is hella charming
[3:32:35] <Smolkupo> You know who's edgy? All the people who decry newer Final Fantasies and "only like the old ones" LUL
[3:32:35] <duke0fspook> @AngriestPat Go back to your stupid banner saga
[3:32:36] <+DrThwack> made with love
[3:32:37] <Twoiis> It's rustic!
[3:32:37] <$joylent_blue> pat joins the chat and instantly everyone is MAD
[3:32:38] <element_of_loyalty> PAT STARTS A FIGHT IN THE CHAT
[3:32:38] <hntronium> So its been replaced with better spice
[3:32:40] <%TrevyWeaponsGuy> I can't believe Pat punched that bee's nest
[3:32:42] <%umbypokochan> this game has the zapping system because you can cast LIT
[3:32:43] <+Vestillion> Honestly, I think Modern Final Fantasy is too full of itself.
[3:32:50] <emoonimoo> FF4 has Golbez - therefore it is wonderful
[3:32:50] <$Kain5707> where is Pat even hiding?
[3:32:51] <mercado94> Why are you so wise? @AngriestPat
[3:32:52] <jeecay> @element_of_loyalty lol
[3:32:59] <%TECHNO_OUTLAW> @AngriestPat Call peach and blow her up on stream
[3:33:02] <$BioStormX> woah how come nobody told me peach was plaoying the BEST FINAL FANTASY GAME except tactics
[3:33:05] <%umbypokochan> look she's using the zapping system right now!
[3:33:08] <%TrevyWeaponsGuy> Quick, Pat's watching from the closet
[3:33:11] <+Sylpphire> @Kain5707 closet dungeon
[3:33:11] <Prevot> what if I don't like ANY Final Fantasy? :thinking:
[3:33:13] <+textandnumbers> don't you think part of this is due to you growing up with the game?
[3:33:14] <+rcand9> i dunno id take old clunk over a bad kh attempt like 15
[3:33:14] <element_of_loyalty> CALL PEACH AND SPEAKER PHONE
[3:33:14] <Skrist> @Vestillion That can't be true. FF15 released incomplete.
[3:33:16] <%TheGershon> These ones are timeless
[3:33:21] <+textandnumbers> and people who grow up with the new games would love them more
[3:33:27] <AlasterAngelo> last good FF was 12
[3:33:28] <+AntithesisEK> the new ones have 'wonder' but they don't always have 'whimsy'
[3:33:29] <hntronium> OH YEAH ITS PAT'S TURN TO CALL PEACH
[3:33:29] <@WoolyFish> I'm willing to bet money that Paige will cry at the FF14 story if she played it.
[3:33:29] <SuperNotSuspiciousMan> CRAZY people
[3:33:29] <%heyitsbrian> well that's FF13's fault
[3:33:30] <SGrim> There's an obvious reason: nostalgia. rooKek
[3:33:30] <$joylent_blue> how dare you criticize the new thing you hipster BabyRage
[3:33:30] <$Kain5707> @sylpphire LUL fair enough
[3:33:30] <+Sylpphire> no one ever
[3:33:36] <%umbypokochan> this is the only FF game you can play 2 player by assigning characters to the second controller
[3:33:36] <Davifflaelan> I play FF8 because I hate myself
[3:33:41] <+Vestillion> @Skrist good one.
[3:33:42] <%TheGershon> 13/15 are so made to appeal to people at the time
[3:33:44] <$Agami23> do you think octopath and world of final fantasy have the feel of old final fantasy games? @PeachSaliva
[3:33:44] <%bloodypurpledog> Aw yeah custom robo and Billy Hatcher
[3:33:46] <element_of_loyalty> PAT CALL PEACH
[3:33:48] <KeiPrime> ff14 has a fun storyline no kiddin
[3:33:49] <$BioStormX> I haven't even played FF15 yet because they won't fucking stop making more parts of it
[3:33:49] <hntronium> PAT, CALL PAIGE ON THE PHONE AND ROAST HER
[3:33:49] <+Sylpphire> we dont discuss ff13
[3:33:55] <element_of_loyalty> MaxLOL
[3:33:56] <%heyitsbrian> movies like Casablanca and Gone with the Wind were amazing movies... for their time
[3:33:56] <Ell1ot> i wouldn't like to get invited to someone's house to watch them play a jrpg
[3:33:57] <%Kefbar> lost odysey is the real final fantasy 13 and it is really good
[3:33:57] <%TheGershon> 4-10 are just trying to be good games
[3:33:58] <$joylent_blue> umbypokochan 9 does that too
[3:34:01] <%heyitsbrian> release them today, and they'd be terrible
[3:34:05] <%Remery_> Pat Invasion apatDab apatDab

[3:34:48] <emoonimoo> I grew up with FF10 and up because I was a baby when the classics all came out, but had it not been for the newer games like FF15, I wouldn't be playing all the classics
[3:34:50] <HorribleHog> Oh boy, this battletheme's going to be playing in my head
[3:34:52] <element_of_loyalty> YEA YEA YEA
[3:34:53] <%umbypokochan> Woolie would appreciate this game because there's caves behind waterfalls that have items
[3:34:54] <rustymcbusty> Is that what pat is up to?

[3:35:42] <Smolkupo> @PeachSaliva So you consider FF15 to be bad, what's your opinion on 10 and 12? Those could be considered newer FFs too
[3:35:42] <Eresus> FF starts at all the bravest
[3:35:45] <KeiPrime> 11 also has a decent story but yeah you gotta play 11 to see it at least up until chains of promathia then i dropped off and dont know nothin
[3:35:48] <reonome> IMPRISONING ME
[3:35:53] <hntronium> Black Evil

[3:36:02] <hntronium> Lalatina
[3:36:03] <%umbypokochan> @DancingMad80 lol
[3:36:04] <$Kain5707> vineNut

[3:36:08] <Ell1ot> his number is so BIG!
[3:36:08] <Zaver88> So Dragon Quest 11 is next Tuesday. Are you gonna play it? Dragon Quest has that really simplistic story.
[3:36:12] <Intolerable> ABSOLUTE HORROR
[3:36:12] <%GarbageNirvana> vineNut
[3:36:14] <$BioStormX> NEVER USE ETHER
[3:36:17] <OvenMittMaster> vineNut
[3:36:18] <applesonthemoon> the STENCH of DARKNESS
[3:36:20] <Reizunari> FF starts at Wizardry
[3:36:21] <+Vestillion> I wish Final fantasy hadn't gone full magitech bullshit all over.
[3:36:22] <element_of_loyalty> ZAMBINOS
[3:36:22] <+DrThwack> idk about thr quality of 15 since i haven't played it but everything around it such as that lame ass movie and the phone games ruin some integrity of the game
[3:36:26] <+Vestillion> It's really tainted the well.
[3:36:27] <jeecay> CAUSE THIS IS THRILLER!
[3:36:27] <$BioStormX> You can't use Ether ever, you might need it later
[3:36:29] <$joylent_blue> running D:
[3:36:30] <+DrThwack> but that's just me lol
[3:36:30] <emoonimoo> Cecil is is stenched with the darkness!!
[3:36:30] <reonome> cowarded out
[3:36:33] <%umbypokochan> save ether for the final battle and then not use any!
[3:36:36] <hntronium> Big cowardice
[3:36:38] <element_of_loyalty> 14 year old Paige
[3:36:42] <%Remery_> just like Pat <3
[3:36:43] <%TheGershon> That reminds me, is 15 done yet?
[3:36:45] <$joylent_blue> Cecil reeks of the DARKNESS now
[3:36:51] <%umbypokochan> lol fuck dem zomboides
[3:36:51] <GordonRD> paid over a hundred pounds back in the day to import FFVI and a convertor to use it on a PAL SNES. we didn't get a nainline Final Fantasy in the UK until VII on the PS1
[3:36:53] <+AntithesisEK> cantaNap 💤 ⛺
[3:36:53] <element_of_loyalty> the sex happened
[3:36:57] <@WoolyFish> She pussied out how disappointing.
[3:37:00] <KeiPrime> theres more 15 content coming out next year according to SE
[3:37:00] <hntronium> Cecil is the Black Evil
[3:37:01] <Ell1ot> if they're not good enough to catch you, then they're not worth your time
[3:37:02] <SGrim> Small girl alone with 2 men... rooLewd
[3:37:02] <Smolkupo> What is Paige playing this on by the way? Is it emulated?
[3:37:03] <DancingMad80> Use all your elixers right now
[3:37:06] <%rdark_ksu> dude rpgs make me such a fucking hoarder
[3:37:09] <BourneWarrior> You can't Buy Ethers
[3:37:12] <$mandragoraroot> ya gotta save em!
[3:37:16] <Kaneis> Joseph Anderson and his jam breads
[3:37:17] <$BioStormX> You can sell ethers for a good price tho
[3:37:20] <$joylent_blue> Smolkupo yes
[3:37:23] <%umbypokochan> can't use the precious
[3:37:28] <%umbypokochan> must keep the precious
[3:37:29] <DedlokPM> No. Stockpiling stuff 100% the normal response. apatWhat
[3:37:30] <element_of_loyalty> PIMPLES
[3:37:33] <%TheGershon> But is that content going to affect the base game? I don't want to buy dlc
[3:37:33] <DancingMad80> Buy Elixers on teh Moon!
[3:37:36] <+DrThwack> who cares
[3:37:37] <Luesagna00> @peachsaliva thats rl cool using tent does a thing. kingdom hearts tent dont do shit
[3:37:38] <Yukisoda> @Smolkupo Emulated through Retroarch
[3:37:39] <SuperNotSuspiciousMan> I actually love the concept of magitech just because it makes sense to me as the next step to something like "magical science"
[3:37:40] <+rcand9> use ethers dont ever use elixer you total dork SwiftRage
[3:37:41] <+SolidusRex> What version of FFIV is she playing? Looks like either the PS1 version or the SNES version emulated
[3:37:45] <+DrThwack> i think 4 yiu can learn osmose?
[3:37:48] <+skizzuto> Rydia twiddling her thumbs to cast magic lol
[3:37:52] <KeiPrime> emulated snes
[3:37:55] <element_of_loyalty> LUNA ROCKS
[3:37:56] <%TheGershon> Snes version with bsnes via retroarch
[3:37:57] <tacostarvedbeast> @peachsaliva any interest in dragon quest?
[3:38:06] <KeiPrime> cecil doesnt have darkness wave thats how i can tell
[3:38:10] <%TrevyWeaponsGuy> "But I only have 98 of them"
[3:38:16] <$BioStormX> You made the messages slower
[3:38:23] <jeecay> So elixers in this game are like magnum bullets in resident evil 2
[3:38:25] <+Brighthawk> Pat uses too many Red Bull Elixirs all the time
[3:38:38] <Reizunari> I just sell the elixers i mean fuck it im just gonna hoard them and never use em.
[3:38:44] <Rellim80> Did she pull an Ethal from a chest?? Who's going around stuffing Grandma's into Chests?
[3:38:46] <jeecay> lol paige interupted the monster picnic
[3:38:51] <element_of_loyalty> Pat is Wesker and needs daily red bull injections
[3:39:22] <+rcand9> we need a lit counter Kreygasm
[3:39:39] <jeecay> redbull is to pat what spinach is to Popeye
[3:39:42] <Eresus> @Reizunari the problem is that elixers usually only sell for 1gp
[3:39:56] <$BioStormX> Dark Knight Cecil might be edgy but in that cool way where I was like 13 when I played it
[3:40:03] <%Sinister_Aglet> popeye doesn't get the shakes without spinach
[3:40:10] <jeecay> you don't know
[3:40:11] <+DrThwack> legends say that pat was baptized with red bull
[3:40:12] <+Mekhet09> They did that so you wouldn't sell them.
[3:40:18] <element_of_loyalty> HYDROBOT
[3:40:35] <jeecay> has there ever been a full episode of popeye where he isn't eating spinich?
[3:40:37] <+Fenlig> "Water" we all know its mustard
[3:40:39] <+JenovasPuppet> Has Popeye ever gone more than a day without spinach? You know he's addicted.
[3:40:44] <+rcand9> hydrobot not doing a good job
[3:40:47] <+SevenDeadlyCyns> Dark Knight Cecil is a big baby and deserves to be thrown in a locker
[3:40:49] <$Kain5707> just cure the zombies @peachsaliva
[3:40:52] <KeiPrime> ever play the 3d remake of ff4
[3:40:53] <SpinnySpinda> LUL
[3:40:54] <duke0fspook> HAHAHAHA
[3:40:55] <+smargh1015> i like how you need to retrain paladin cecil from level one
[3:40:56] <KeiPrime> its pretty good
[3:40:57] <element_of_loyalty> Gut full of Mustard and Coconut water
[3:40:58] <%Ciphris> cecil legit did it for his king tho
[3:41:01] <Reizunari> @Eresus Ah yeah you completely right guess i've been thinking of more modern rpg's
[3:41:03] <@WoolyFish> God damn it.
[3:41:07] <mercado94> Why do you hate the zombies?
[3:41:10] <%TheFilth> He’s basically shadow the hedgehog
[3:41:14] <$BioStormX> Use elixers on the zombies
[3:41:20] <mr22apples> Paige sounds like Emil when she hums
[3:41:24] <+DrThwack> funny thing, you can easily level paladin cecil
[3:41:24] <KeiPrime> cecil sucks against zombies he's too dorkness
[3:41:24] <+Vestillion> I always thought Disney and FF mixed like oil and water
[3:41:25] <AlasterAngelo> phoenix down the zombies
[3:41:31] <mercado94> I see
[3:41:35] <SuperNotSuspiciousMan> the only thing that irks me about cecil at the start is just the fact that he thought being a DARK knight wasn't going to end as nefarious at all. i mean, he became a DARK Knight. even the people in town are like "you look scary dude"
[3:41:37] <+skizzuto> fire and healing works on zombies
[3:41:39] <$Kain5707> cure then
[3:41:40] <+Vestillion> you can have both in a bowl, but they're never going to blend well.
[3:41:40] <$mandragoraroot> youll kill em though
[3:41:45] <$Kain5707> them*
[3:41:46] <jeecay> use THRILLER on the zombies
[3:41:51] <$joylent_blue> don't we all
[3:41:52] <MONSTRx_x> use holy water on the zombies
[3:41:58] <Luesagna00> use lower healing items on zombambos!
[3:41:59] <SchroedingersFerret> Use the rocket launcher on the zombies
[3:42:00] <+SevenDeadlyCyns> Run away from the zombies
[3:42:04] <@WoolyFish> Why doesn't Elmo walk around during the day? Is he a T-rex?
[3:42:05] <$joylent_blue> "i only have like, one life" that's deep paige
[3:42:06] <@PlagueOfGripes> Paige did you ever play 9
[3:42:07] <element_of_loyalty> Use Rick Grimes on Zeds
[3:42:08] <%umbypokochan> BURNING
[3:42:12] <+rcand9> throw best weapon at the zombo?
[3:42:13] <jeecay> another monster picnic. RUINED BY PAGE
[3:42:21] <KaiserMario> Use penis on zombies
[3:42:23] <+smargh1015> learn meteor just to kill one zombie
[3:42:27] <jeecay> Why can't you let them have a good time paige?
[3:42:36] <$Kain5707> x is fan service
[3:42:43] <element_of_loyalty> Seduce the Zombies
[3:42:47] <mercado94> 9 has the best music
[3:42:48] <Ipsenscastle> bleeetzballll
[3:42:48] <$BioStormX> TEACH US HOW TO BLITZ
[3:42:53] <@MelBrooksKA> A German Spy was playing a lot of 9
[3:42:54] <Reizunari> 9 a best love that game
[3:42:54] <@WoolyFish> 10 takes place in the same world as 7.
[3:42:55] <+skizzuto> 9 is best PS2 final fantasy
[3:42:56] <@PlagueOfGripes> figured you would
[3:42:57] <applesonthemoon> ! BLEETZBOLL !
[3:43:04] <@PlagueOfGripes> I mean the battle music is almost this battle music
[3:43:04] <+CJett92> 10 is pretty cheesy in a pretty endearing way
[3:43:04] <%TheFilth> X was my first so it will always be special for me
[3:43:06] <+skizzuto> *PS1
[3:43:08] <+Alaster101> 12 is pretty good
[3:43:11] <Ipsenscastle> uematsu's fave soundtrack
[3:43:12] <+rcand9> blitzballs misunderstood its pretty indepth
[3:43:14] <@MelBrooksKA> It looked like it was pretty fun
[3:43:16] <+Ondartyr> I haven't played all that many FFs, but I feel like 9 is the last one I heard really good things about
[3:43:17] <%umbypokochan> and it has chocobo hot n cold <3
[3:43:18] <jeecay> hot take. 8 is good. FIGHT ME!
[3:43:19] <SuperNotSuspiciousMan> X is....fine. I liked it the first time, the second... oof I noticed all the issues afterwards
[3:43:21] <+JenovasPuppet> 9 is like the old games but good.
[3:43:25] <NoctisxMog> I'm playing 9 for the first time and it's great
[3:43:26] <element_of_loyalty> Dr Chapstick?
[3:43:27] <Davifflaelan> how come peach hasn't killed the vvemon on the team
[3:43:28] <+SevenDeadlyCyns> I played through X recently, for the first time, and I can tell what people liked about it... in 2002. It's been 16 years since, we're allowed to think games are better
[3:43:29] <KeiPrime> grinding out to get world champion fully unlocked made me like blitzball but like out of stockholm syndrome
[3:43:29] <Ell1ot> My two favorite lines from ffX is, "I NEED FOOD" and "HAHAHAHAHAHA"
[3:43:29] <Ipsenscastle> ffix has 2-player battles, you should play it with pat!
[3:43:33] <+Ondartyr> Or rather, not also a bunch of bad things
[3:43:36] <$BioStormX> I think 4 is the best but I have the most nostalgia for 7
[3:43:37] <%Gogogolem> I don't remember 4
[3:43:39] <+Alaster101> im playing through 12 and loving i
[3:43:41] <SuperNotSuspiciousMan> 8 is fine. but I hate the spell stocking.
[3:43:41] <+Alaster101> it
[3:43:42] <stovetopism> 9 probably has my favorite ost out of all the final fantasys
[3:43:44] <+vaporousTippler> Seifer's the best character the FF series has ever made.
[3:43:44] <duke0fspook> I just don't like Zidane, he really gets on my nerves.
[3:43:45] <$BioStormX> Well, other than Tactics which is the actual best
[3:43:46] <%Gogogolem> Whose in 4?
[3:43:53] <%umbypokochan> i prefer Romancing Saga 2 to any of them
[3:43:56] <Reizunari> @jeecay Your not alone
[3:44:01] <+rcand9> i like nine but never had time to beat it
[3:44:04] <Eresus> I like cyberpunk so I love FF7
[3:44:05] <jeecay> @BioStormX that is correct. tactics is best
[3:44:16] <AlasterAngelo> 12 is the best i love the OG Star Wars trilogy
[3:44:20] <+Ondartyr> The best final fantasy is Chrono Trigger
[3:44:20] <+Sylpphire> ff6 was pretty good
[3:44:21] <$Kain5707> Chrono Trigger is the best jrpg
[3:44:24] <+rcand9> 4 is fave
[3:44:27] <@WoolyFish> But neither of those have Lulu.
[3:44:28] <+SevenDeadlyCyns> Final Fantasy 4 was the first one to have a story worth caring about
[3:44:28] <admiralsatan> nostalgia helps tbh
[3:44:30] <+Alaster101> hey AlasterAngelo nice name
[3:44:36] <Ell1ot> i've never played this one
[3:44:39] <jeecay> @Reizunari <3
[3:44:40] <KeiPrime> ff4 is like the first one where it kinda clicks on what final fantasy is imo
[3:44:41] <+SolidusRex> My top 3 FFs are FFVII, FFV, and FFIX.
[3:44:41] <SuperNotSuspiciousMan> 7 knows how to work it's setting and story very well
[3:44:41] <+rcand9> i just like lunar whales dude
[3:44:44] <AlasterAngelo> @Alaster101 one of us is going to have to change
[3:44:45] <+Mekhet09> Breath of fire 3/4 were honestly better than the old FFs.
[3:44:50] <@PlagueOfGripes> Ewww, nuance
[3:44:51] <%JackMillerTime> but i love the fonz tho
[3:44:54] <duke0fspook> Ha
[3:44:55] <duke0fspook> FF8
[3:44:56] <$BioStormX> And also we all grew up at the same orphanage
[3:44:59] <+thesw1tch> the belts are the best part
[3:44:59] <%Sinister_Aglet> Nomura BTFO
[3:44:59] <%heyitsbrian> I love FF4, but is it really a JRPG? If somoene told me they wanted to get into JRPG's, I wouldn't tell them to play this one...
[3:45:01] <SulfurousAcid> oh Nomura's designs
[3:45:03] <Yukisoda> As much of a mess as it is, I still love 6
[3:45:04] <+Alaster101> @AlasterAngelo There can only be one
[3:45:06] <%Gogogolem> Those belts are pratical they are to hold in the anime tiddies.
[3:45:09] <@PlagueOfGripes> I would devastate Lulu
[3:45:12] <+Sylpphire> I heard ff8 has alot of problems...
[3:45:14] <%Hilleltaco> You need the belts to hold up the belts
[3:45:14] <Animeshowfan> god i hate the black leather things they wear its so boring
[3:45:15] <%TrevyWeaponsGuy> Who wouldn't
[3:45:15] <%Ciphris> lulu gets a pass
[3:45:16] <%TheFilth> I had the ds 3D version of this game, never got past the first couple of hours
[3:45:20] <$BioStormX> Lulu was hot as fuuuck
[3:45:21] <Worldbrand> I dunno, I think if these characters had the fidelity of their concept art they would also look ridiculous
[3:45:21] <jeecay> Belts are cool. especially when you wrap them around your fist and punch people
[3:45:22] <SuperNotSuspiciousMan> Lulu is ridiculous
[3:45:26] <+SevenDeadlyCyns> Nuance will DESTROY this stream
[3:45:27] <+GuelermeDias> that dude hit his head very hard
[3:45:28] <Reizunari> Lulu is best girl
[3:45:28] <SchroedingersFerret> Don't you dare shit on my wife Lulu
[3:45:30] <mercado94> Wat
[3:45:30] <Luesagna00> or like zippers like donald in kingdom heart
[3:45:31] <The_Esquana> thanks for helping me procrastinate from my math homework Paige! @PeachSaliva
[3:45:31] <%Remery_> lulu needs does belts to contain that RACK
[3:45:32] <KeiPrime> ff4 is like the most jrpg
[3:45:35] <%umbypokochan> this is literally one of the JRPG classics
[3:45:35] <@WoolyFish> I would turn Lulu's insides into scrambled eggs.
[3:45:35] <+sovietd0ge> I finally realized I'd been watching Peach all this time from Pat hosting her. XD
[3:45:36] <$KnivesEve> what?
[3:45:36] <+CJett92> what?
[3:45:36] <+rcand9> its japanese and an rpg
[3:45:36] <$mandragoraroot> ?
[3:45:39] <+Sylpphire> what?
[3:45:44] <+MisterTylerrr> FF7 is also bizarrely relevant to stuff going on in the world today when it comes to the Shinra stuff
[3:45:44] <+JenovasPuppet> LUL
[3:45:44] <+Mister_Ari> When i found out about final fantasy as a teenager when 13 had just come out, 4 appealed to me most because it was the first one that had characters with a set story rather than generic character!
[3:45:45] <Ell1ot> how can this be?!
[3:45:45] <Ser_Randal> DAMN
[3:45:46] <%TrevyWeaponsGuy> Wooly no
[3:45:47] <jeecay> burn
[3:45:47] <SuperNotSuspiciousMan> oof
[3:45:47] <epylepticpanda> U broke paige
[3:45:50] <zamzoph> 666 viewers monkaS
[3:45:51] <duke0fspook> Oh shit
[3:45:53] <%Sinister_Aglet> Lulu lives on a tropical island why fur and leather belts why
[3:45:54] <duke0fspook> Ooooh shit
[3:45:55] <+skizzuto> If you're looking for simple jrpg fun, have you played the Bravely Default games?
[3:45:56] <+GuelermeDias> i do what the fuck dude
[3:45:58] <$Agami23> nomura did that because someone told him he put too many belts on his characters, so he put more.
[3:46:00] <mercado94> This is clearly a visual novel
[3:46:04] <$Agami23> spite-belts
[3:46:05] <+SevenDeadlyCyns> The only thing that is more JRPG than FF4 is Castle in the Sky
[3:46:06] <+JenovasPuppet> Cursed stream
[3:46:07] <hntronium> Its missing good gameplay
[3:46:09] <+Alaster101> this is character action yes?
[3:46:11] <duke0fspook> BD has the retreading problem
[3:46:11] <Luesagna00> missing ricecakes!
[3:46:16] <+SolidusRex> Hey Paige, what's your opinion on the DS remake of this game?
[3:46:16] <$BioStormX> Did you ever beat FFT?
[3:46:21] <jeecay> ass fought out.
[3:46:23] <+smargh1015> Lulu is like one of those characters that kind of just breaks fiction by how irrationally attractive they are, also fubiki from OPM
[3:46:26] <AlasterAngelo> i remember Rydia artwork being a grown ass woman why does she look like a little girl
[3:46:30] <KaiserMario> What about the Tales series... That's some JRPGs
[3:46:30] <SuperNotSuspiciousMan> Wait didn't lulu end up with wakka somehow in X-2? or am I misremembering?
[3:46:38] <+GuelermeDias> she gets older
[3:46:38] <Worldbrand> It's an immersive sim
[3:46:38] <jeecay> weeeeeee
[3:46:39] <+GuelermeDias> duh
[3:46:44] <duke0fspook> You aren't misremembering
[3:46:45] <KeiPrime> wakka puts a bun in lulu's oven
[3:46:54] <%TheFilth> We don’t talk about x-2
[3:46:55] <Eresus> there are plot reasons
[3:46:57] <Ell1ot> ?what is the reason?
[3:46:58] <@PlagueOfGripes> Jojo fish
[3:46:59] <%Remery_> @PeachSaliva Do you like Milkshakes?
[3:47:00] <$Agami23> @AlasterAngelo theres a sequel with adult rydia. with a leotard and lulu chest
[3:47:01] <duke0fspook> Wakka totally taps that because good on him
[3:47:05] <NoctisxMog> just barely missed those rocks
[3:47:06] <mercado94> Lulu got preggo with wakka hate seed
[3:47:07] <jeecay> Jojo posing fishmen? this must be the work of an enemy stand!
[3:47:09] <%Remery_> @KeiPrime Her Vagoven
[3:47:14] <+rcand9> missing doughnuts that are clearly riceballs Kappa
[3:47:15] <+JenovasPuppet> Wakka is Lulu's silver medal.
[3:47:17] <+GuelermeDias> imagine settling for wakka
[3:47:20] <%Gogogolem> I sumon this giant chicken
[3:47:20] <$Agami23> called "ff4 the afteryears
[3:47:22] <KaiserMario> @PlagueOfGripes Are you drawing big butts right now?

[3:48:20] <Ell1ot> I saw The Shape of Water the other day. these fish people remind me of that movie
[3:48:22] <+GuelermeDias> paige why are you fireing the water guys
[3:48:22] <Eresus> the after years is fine, it recycles most of the plot of ff4, but it's fine
[3:48:23] <The_Esquana> is pineapple good on pizza? answer carefully
[3:48:25] <%umbypokochan> sipsipHellmo sipsipHellmo sipsipHellmo

[3:48:48] <%TheFilth> Paige wants those watermelon crushers
[3:48:51] <+GuelermeDias> they're goku?
[3:48:56] <%Gogogolem> Paige has to be strong to fight the lupus.
[3:49:00] <+SevenDeadlyCyns> It's sfw
[3:49:01] <Luesagna00> are they doing jojo?
[3:49:01] <SuperNotSuspiciousMan> that's good
[3:49:02] <+MisterTylerrr> It's clean leave it in
[3:49:03] <+obscureanimeguy> too late clicking
[3:49:04] <The_Esquana> its pure dont worry
[3:49:05] <+VanaSkiller> do it
[3:49:06] <%heyitsbrian> I don't know if it's 'missing' anything... I guess it just feels like it doesn't slap the 'Japan' part of JRPG in your face like modern ones seem to do.
[3:49:06] <@PlagueOfGripes> I lost any sympathy for shape of water guy when he killed that cat like a dumb animal
[3:49:07] <%Remery_> @PlagueOfGripes sipsipGasm
[3:49:08] <+Envisage> oh it's so cute, plague
[3:49:08] <+Fenlig> Shes cute
[3:49:10] <+Vestillion> The link is Innocent enough
[3:49:10] <$Agami23> that seems weirdly wholesome plague. whats the catch?
[3:49:10] <Ell1ot> are these fish people considered reverse mermaids?
[3:49:11] <duke0fspook> It is SFW
[3:49:11] <+smargh1015> just a cute dog gif
[3:49:20] <cptbellybutton352> click it its safe
[3:49:28] <+AntithesisEK> okay yea I got that moment massively reduced sympathy
[3:49:28] <+GuelermeDias> plague is just jealous he didn't get to fuck the fishman
[3:49:31] <element_of_loyalty> CROCS
[3:49:33] <jeecay> aldigadors
[3:49:33] <+AntithesisEK> that made no sense in the narrative
[3:49:38] <%Remery_> Plague with the safe click, what world is this?
[3:49:42] <%redstonej> lost respect for him and found love for him
[3:49:44] <@PlagueOfGripes> yeah he can go fuck himself
[3:49:47] <Spydurman> makes him feel less like a dude and more like a fish which makes them fucking creepier
[3:49:47] <jeecay> welcome to jurassic park
[3:49:50] <+SolidusRex> I 100% agree with Plague.
[3:49:57] <tUxUt> i wanted to watch shape of water, but now that i know he kills a cat, nevermind :(
[3:49:59] <Ipsenscastle> seconded
[3:50:03] <%Gogogolem> To make it more creepy when that lady fucks him.
[3:50:07] <KeiPrime> its only a cat, now if it were a dog
[3:50:08] <Davifflaelan> what movie
[3:50:14] <%Remery_> lady fuck a cat killer
[3:50:15] <KeiPrime> that would be a different story all together
[3:50:18] <RichAnvils> fuck an animal
[3:50:19] <@PlagueOfGripes> that's all it really did. made him look less human and more just a stupid animal she fucked
[3:50:21] <KaiserMario> @PlagueOfGripes I see... is it for a commission? I don't recognize this "cus" of yours...
[3:50:23] <The_Esquana> yeah but why would I feel sympathy for an fishman animals that kills a cat
[3:50:28] <$BioStormX> cheer1000 5 Day Weekend staaaaart
[3:50:29] <%redstonej> the cat was asking for it, looking so tasty and shit
[3:50:30] <SuperNotSuspiciousMan> Acquired: DARKNESS

[3:50:43] <+MisterTylerrr> DARKNESS

[3:51:06] <+GuelermeDias> why are you guys so discriminating
[3:51:07] <Davifflaelan> what movie are we talking about?
[3:51:09] <+JenovasPuppet> @WoolyFish This guy gets it.

[3:51:17] <mercado94> SUBMIT
[3:51:18] <+rcand9> biostormx is a name matt would love
[3:51:23] <jeecay> CAUSE THIS IS THRILLER!
[3:51:28] <$mandragoraroot> 1
[3:51:29] <Yukisoda> The THRILLER is growing
[3:51:35] <Ell1ot> i was surprised that they explained how fish man's junk worked in that movie
[3:51:36] <+KaijuQueenCallie> the fishman had no idea what a cat or a domestic animal was
[3:51:40] <%Remery_> Alf gave kids nightmares
[3:51:40] <%AbnormalVoid> Water doesn't have a shape, duh
[3:51:42] <hntronium> The shape of fish dicks
[3:51:43] <Intolerable> @MisterTylerrr Darkens?
[3:51:45] <%TrevyWeaponsGuy> Oh no, they got kind of a Robbie Rotten thing going on
[3:51:47] <%TrevyWeaponsGuy> Oh jeez
[3:51:55] <hntronium> The shape of animal abuse by fish dicks
[3:51:57] <BioStormX> The Bio in BioStormX was named after the poison spell in FF7 fun fact
[3:51:57] <Davifflaelan> is the shape of water worth seeing?
[3:51:57] <Animeshowfan> god those zombies have very well tones bodys
[3:51:58] <KaiserMario> LUL look at those undead... "SURPRISE!!!"
[3:52:00] <The_Esquana> guys is league of legends dead, is there any saving it?
[3:52:02] <+GrimSquirrel> WASNT THE FISH THING LIKE 12 Y/O?
[3:52:03] <+MisterTylerrr> @Intolerable I fucked up, my desk is cluttered with dinner atm
[3:52:04] <%AbnormalVoid> or actually, that's not true, water is shaped kinda like a triangle that's missing one side
[3:52:06] <+JenovasPuppet> Holy fuck that Fire fucks them up
[3:52:07] <+GrimSquirrel> caps
[3:52:07] <jeecay> fire was better than everything else
[3:52:09] <%heyitsbrian> eh, I just must be crazy
[3:52:11] <%redstonej> sex with a fish person... there I said the spoiler
[3:52:11] <Animeshowfan> youd think being dead would make them less ripped
[3:52:16] <%TrevyWeaponsGuy> apatBig fire
[3:52:16] <@PlagueOfGripes> probably didn't deserve best picture
[3:52:17] <AlasterAngelo> @The_Esquana yes and no
[3:52:19] <+SevenDeadlyCyns> don't fuck the zombies, paige
[3:52:20] <+KaijuQueenCallie> shape of water is a great film
[3:52:23] <admiralsatan> no cure spell?
[3:52:24] <+rcand9> cowards way best way
[3:52:28] <jeecay> paige needs MJ in her party for them zombies
[3:52:29] <element_of_loyalty> MORE ZEDS
[3:52:31] <+Sylpphire> never watched the shape of water
[3:52:31] <%TrevyWeaponsGuy> Avatar didn't deserve half the things it got
[3:52:32] <+GuelermeDias> big coward paige
[3:52:37] <AncelDeLambert> aaaah, FINALLY, I'm home from work and have a proper keyboard!
[3:52:44] <+Sylpphire> Avatar was alright...
[3:52:46] <The_Esquana> @AlasterAngelo I gave up on it a long time ago, but I wanted to get back into it :/
[3:52:47] <+JenovasPuppet> Maximum Darkness
[3:52:47] <BioStormX> cheer100 cheer100 cheer100 cheer100 cheer100 Also have you ever beat FF Tactics?
[3:52:49] <hntronium> BIG BLACK EVIL
[3:52:49] <Ell1ot> Paige bravely ran away
[3:52:51] <+SevenDeadlyCyns> My body is darkness
[3:52:54] <+GuelermeDias> so dark and edgy
[3:52:58] <banjopsn> Zombies are weak to white magic
[3:52:59] <SuperNotSuspiciousMan> from shadow to DARKNESS. SO EDGE
[3:53:08] <+smargh1015> but really who cares about the Oscars much anymore
[3:53:09] <@PlagueOfGripes> strategic pants wetting
[3:53:09] <+vaporousTippler> Darkness, imprisoning me.
[3:53:10] <element_of_loyalty> Honesty is the best policy
[3:53:12] <jeecay> and though paige fights to stay alive, her body starts to quiver. For no mere ginger can resist, the eeeeeeevil of THE THRILLER!
[3:53:14] <The_Esquana> "strategic running away"
[3:53:16] <%AbnormalVoid> Paige Tactics Run! PogChamp
[3:53:16] <Worldbrand> Marche: right or wrong?
[3:53:18] <AlasterAngelo> @The_Esquana if you can play with friends its okay but honestly its just not even worth the time and frustration
[3:53:20] <+GuelermeDias> white magic is like, pumpkinspiceaga?
[3:53:24] <$Agami23> advance? the better tactics?
[3:53:27] <%Remery_> FF Tactics is such a fun grind
[3:53:28] <BioStormX> Marche was OBVIOUSLY right
[3:53:30] <Eresus> tactics advance is good
[3:53:31] <Gnapalm> talk more about the scaley movie that won a golden globes
[3:53:35] <AlasterAngelo> a major hit against league I feel is the hour long matches
[3:53:36] <AncelDeLambert> Is that Ultros back there, what's he doing in this game?
[3:53:36] <+rcand9> strategic brilliance of doing a run
[3:53:37] <mistermastergreg> advance is kinda good
[3:53:40] <Darkblade0242> #DickKnight muhShrug
[3:53:40] <@WoolyFish> 80% of my hand lotion folder is Darkness.
[3:53:41] <jeecay> @Agami23 HOW DARE YOU UTTER SUCH BLASPHAMY
[3:53:41] <Daxalog> Advanced is cool
[3:53:43] <Ell1ot> When Danger reared its ugly head, Page bravely turned her tail and fled
[3:53:45] <+Sylpphire> Tactics advance is one of my favorites
[3:53:50] <stovetopism> Why play a strategy game when you can play something gun?
[3:53:52] <AncelDeLambert> IT'S ULTROS!
[3:53:53] <+GuelermeDias> octomaaaaaaaa'am
[3:53:55] <$mandragoraroot> ???
[3:53:55] <Yukisoda> Octomom
[3:53:55] <Luesagna00> isnt ethers SUPER EXPENSIVE???
[3:53:56] <jeecay> 8 bit jaws?
[3:53:57] <element_of_loyalty> @AngriestPat you need to be here to HONK
[3:53:57] <+GuelermeDias> nobody suspects a thing
[3:53:58] <%Remery_> Tentacles
[3:53:58] <Animeshowfan> oh shit the tenticals
[3:53:59] <RichAnvils> I've seen enough anime to know how this ends
[3:54:01] <%AbnormalVoid> Advance is good, but it's nowhere as good as original Tactics
[3:54:08] <mercado94> Just like in my hentais!
[3:54:08] <$Agami23> easily.
[3:54:10] <Worldbrand> I'm also in the Marche Was Right camp
[3:54:12] <AlasterAngelo> ugh
[3:54:13] <$Agami23> is that ultros?
[3:54:14] <SuperNotSuspiciousMan> look at that amazing face

[3:54:21] <Slimerick> @smargh1015 they're at least better than the Grammys at choosing things that are artistically valid
[3:54:21] <KeiPrime> advance 2 is really unmemorable
[3:54:25] <jeecay> LOL. that squid looks like it was drawn by Go Nagai!
[3:54:26] <RichAnvils> YEEEOUCH SEAFOOD SOUP!
[3:54:26] <BioStormX> It's just a meme that Marche was a villain, Clemps did a good job of explaining why Marche was right in a recent video
[3:54:28] <+skizzuto> i don't think you can even target the tentacles they just disappear as you damage him
[3:54:28] <KeiPrime> i dont think it has any extra targets
[3:54:28] <Eresus> protoUltros
[3:54:28] <+Alaster101> tentacles
[3:54:29] <duke0fspook> Uh

[3:54:38] <arcaderabbit48> No
[3:54:38] <@WoolyFish> Always start with head and work your way up from there.

[3:54:39] <jeecay> squidface*
[3:54:40] <%umbypokochan> i don't think there's a gimmick

[3:57:24] <KaiserMario> Riveting gameplay!
[3:57:24] <SuperNotSuspiciousMan> if not try putting some chocolate in your closet and see what happens
[3:57:25] <@PlagueOfGripes> I always forget how these older FFs had characters that were just straight up wild animals
[3:57:31] <+JenovasPuppet> Unomamm
[3:57:32] <Slimerick> @duke0fspook It's weird this is probably one of the FF games I have the fondest memories of too. I remember the twins and being pissed at this old man
[3:57:33] <%Gogogolem> You know they rereleased this and fixed all the translation stuff.
[3:57:33] <xeros720> i was positive it had a counter, it must be to like, fire or something
[3:57:36] <element_of_loyalty> Hang out in public park and wait for pat to appear on kiddie swing
[3:57:36] <Yukisoda> Yes Tellah, it''s a bit hard to move fast when 70% of your arms are cut
[3:57:40] <$mandragoraroot> 😂👌
[3:57:47] <KeiPrime> the mist dragon has a counter state
[3:57:50] <%TrevyWeaponsGuy> Tella's got a hell of a hairdo/goatee combo
[3:57:54] <epylepticpanda> The same goes vise versa, its hard to find a girl like Paige
[3:57:54] <Ell1ot> you did it!
[3:57:54] <Animeshowfan> you did it!
[3:58:04] <xeros720> you're right, i might just be thinking of mist dragon
[3:58:10] <studleydoorite> stop enabling her
[3:58:10] <@WoolyFish> Gladio is a wild animal in the bedroom.

[4:08:49] <+Tokanova> anna was a baddie
[4:08:50] <+ItsYaGirlMaria> just like dark souls
[4:08:50] <tUxUt> bard consumed her body
[4:08:50] <%Gogogolem> Anna was a villian confirmed.
[4:08:50] <+AntithesisEK> it's quite common
[4:08:52] <Mr_Strut> Anna was the true villain!
[4:08:53] <blackbaron98> she is the evil
[4:08:53] <+rcand9> elmo has always seemed a weird dog whats new?
[4:08:56] <PakuV2> She was a mosnter
[4:08:57] <AncelDeLambert> Then she ran into the bedroom, she was struck, a crescendo
[4:08:57] <+JenovasPuppet> Collect the corpse!
[4:08:58] <+GuelermeDias> you lose the good mage and get a shit bard in return

[4:10:15] <AncelDeLambert> mind about to be blown
[4:10:16] <%umbypokochan> @PeachSaliva go to the entrance and go around the right side
[4:10:19] <%AbnormalVoid> not sure if there are any, but it's good to check
[4:10:21] <element_of_loyalty> Peach is so lost
[4:10:23] <Slimerick> Isn't there one in a tavern

[4:12:27] <+Envisage> Wait is this game the Ruby Weapon originates from
[4:12:37] <Firesparks> no
[4:12:39] <Firesparks> ff7 was
[4:12:55] <+Envisage> oh i see
[4:12:59] <blackbaron98> figaro castle is a better castle
[4:13:03] <Davifflaelan> ff8 is and always will be the best FF!
[4:13:05] <Slimerick> Guys this is important, do they say 'shit' near the end of this game or am I imagining that? I think Cecil says it.
[4:13:09] <%umbypokochan> let's just put all these extra arrows in these pots
[4:13:11] <+Skatedeandre> Found “White” LUL
[4:13:22] <Firesparks> paige, tifa or aeris?
[4:13:23] <jeecay> @Davifflaelan preach
[4:13:26] <Dingalow> Time to kill Edward
[4:13:26] <Eresus> figaro castle is best castle
[4:13:28] <%AbnormalVoid> LUL looooool
[4:13:30] <%KaironFortressKnight> No way
[4:13:30] <fairore> nvm
[4:13:30] <KeiPrime> i think they say swears in the translated japanese rom of this one
[4:13:34] <+GrimSquirrel> FF6 best always
[4:13:35] <element_of_loyalty> opinion
[4:13:36] <duke0fspook> @Davifflaelan How can you say something so controversial yet so brave
[4:13:37] <%AbnormalVoid> FF8 is embarrassing
[4:13:43] <KeiPrime> cause transaltors love to swear
[4:13:45] <SubliminaIMessages> Stocking magic for hours is my favorite
[4:13:45] <@PinkieTheEerie> I THINK FF10 IS THE BEST....
[4:13:52] <SuperNotSuspiciousMan> FF8 is fine but I HATE the spell stocking
[4:13:53] <+rcand9> ff8 is the villains choice
[4:13:57] <+SirRoyco> There's never any love for FF3 elchakWorriedMika
[4:14:00] <+Skatedeandre> 13 is the best guys Kappa
[4:14:03] <Gnapalm> I LIKE FF10 THE MOST
[4:14:04] <demonhunter790> Wait why is Paige playing Final Fantasy ?
[4:14:04] <@PinkieTheEerie> the TRUE GAME IS 10
[4:14:06] <+GuelermeDias> there's no such thing as a wrong opinion, except thinking FF8 is the best FF
[4:14:09] <%AbnormalVoid> Rinoa is a basic bitch
[4:14:09] <%umbypokochan> FF8 is fun if you cheat and give yourself all the eidelons at the start
[4:14:09] <+JenovasPuppet> Eight is great
[4:14:11] <Davifflaelan> d
[4:14:11] <@PinkieTheEerie> TEN IS DA BEST PAIGE
[4:14:12] <%Remery_> 9 gave us Vivi <3
[4:14:12] <Dingalow> FF6 tho
[4:14:13] <@PinkieTheEerie> THE BEST
[4:14:14] <Slimerick> ff8 has good overworld music
[4:14:15] <element_of_loyalty> meow
[4:14:18] <%KaironFortressKnight> FF7 is my favorite but I think 4 and 9 are better games.
[4:14:24] <blackbaron98> 6 is the best and thats the RIGHT answer
[4:14:24] <duke0fspook> 10 is basically perfect
[4:14:27] <+GrimSquirrel> love all the love for ffX in here
[4:14:28] <+Ryosuke91> baltheir, bros
[4:14:31] <duke0fspook> You can't change anything about it
[4:14:41] <+skizzuto> Kingdom Hearts is the best final fantasy KappaHD
[4:14:42] <Eresus> @SirRoyco that's because FF5 is esentially a better version of FF3
[4:14:46] <%MediocreHermits> the only thing bad about 10 is the main character
[4:14:47] <+GuelermeDias> the voice acting?
[4:14:49] <%umbypokochan> 10 is like "go this way... no really.. just go this way... no exploring for you!"
[4:14:49] <Ipsenscastle> @KaironFortressKnight i respect that opinion
[4:14:52] <KeiPrime> 5 is rock solid
[4:14:55] <Slimerick> I don't like 10's plot it's all over the place
[4:14:58] <Jakeofalco> so why is she playing is ff ?
[4:14:58] <element_of_loyalty> The Vet will See ELMO
[4:15:00] <duke0fspook> @Eresus And that one has Exdeath
[4:15:08] <+GrimSquirrel> but ff6 is still the best in the series to this day
[4:15:16] <+StarkMaximum> Holy shit is this some classic RPG night with Paige
[4:15:17] <SubliminaIMessages> 6 has the best villain by far
[4:15:19] <blackbaron98> ff6 is the best
[4:15:30] <Slimerick> I will make your viscera see the light of day!
[4:15:31] <%umbypokochan> 6 has Mog... nuff said
[4:15:34] <@WoolyFish> The bard is single now, take him to the slutty dancer.
[4:15:34] <duke0fspook> Most can agree FF6 is one of the best, if not the best
[4:15:34] <+GrimSquirrel> best cast best villian
[4:15:37] <@PinkieTheEerie> i dont care if 10 is a railroad...its a GOOD FUCKING RAILROAD
[4:15:43] <TheNeedlesD> 6 has a Yeti
[4:15:44] <%AbnormalVoid> I'm torn between 6 and 7
[4:15:44] <+rcand9> ff1 has the best voice acting
[4:15:45] <SubliminaIMessages> 6 has Sabin. that motherfucker suplexed a train need i say more
[4:15:48] <jeecay> in all truth though. tactics is best
[4:15:50] <+SirRoyco> @eresus Doesn't make me like FF3 any less :(
[4:15:50] <+jediwatchman11> 10 is a masterpiece
[4:15:51] <%AbnormalVoid> though Tactics is the best, obviously
[4:15:54] <KeiPrime> 15 has a literal railroad
[4:15:55] <admiralsatan> give ed the crossbow
[4:16:03] <TerraWraith> Oh damn it, i went to get food and I missed more woman murder!
[4:16:05] <Dingalow> Which version are you playing @PeachSaliva?
[4:16:07] <duke0fspook> @AbnormalVoid Recall the opera, and your choice is clear
[4:16:10] <jeecay> paige will takes some lifes
[4:16:10] <TheNeedlesD> @SubliminaIMessages a Phantom Train at that
[4:16:10] <+jetrouverai> I really didn't like ff6 that much... I should give it another try
[4:16:14] <Luesagna00> i decide to be back for nother hour tops! NomNom cuz food
[4:16:15] <jeecay> MURDERER
[4:16:18] <+StarkMaximum> The best Final Fantasy is the one you like the best and the one that holds the most nostalgia for you. Also, it's a tie between 5 and 9 and any other choice is wrong.
[4:16:18] <Davifflaelan> never played below 7 & above 12
[4:16:31] <+pratchet> There are so many final fantasies and every one has a hot opinion we should just enumerate which we like.
[4:16:33] <%AbnormalVoid> @duke0fspook yeah, but 7 has crossdressing Cloud
[4:16:33] <blackbaron98> the villan in ff6 *SPOILER* actually won, who else can do that
[4:16:35] <+GuelermeDias> FF5 is the best "casual" FF.
[4:16:35] <+GrimSquirrel> @jetrouverai the story is kinda buried in the side quests
[4:16:36] <element_of_loyalty> @TerraWraith Pat came n went and took Elmo to vet
[4:16:36] <Dingalow> YEYEYEYEYEYE
[4:16:45] <+GuelermeDias> you can break THE FUCK outta stuff in that game
[4:16:48] <CappuccinoGuil> oh man, you guys still going? damn
[4:16:48] <duke0fspook> @AbnormalVoid Yeah but like, that's kinda suspect
[4:16:48] <TerraWraith> Oh no, is Elmo ok?
[4:16:58] <element_of_loyalty> routine check up
[4:16:59] <PakuV2> Crystal Bearers is best FF
[4:17:00] <+jediwatchman11> 10 then 6, then everything else
[4:17:07] <+GuelermeDias> and it doesn't bother with stupid things like PLOT
[4:17:09] <Luesagna00> You happy finding the sort button? pat rly is rubbing off on you
[4:17:15] <+GrimSquirrel> @jetrouverai the character story, like a lot of there background stuff
[4:17:15] <%umbypokochan> FF6... the game where you can kill your father figure with rotten fish
[4:17:24] <Davifflaelan> is ff 1-6 worth playing
[4:17:25] <jeecay> The vet is code for a dark ritual which will syphon off willing souls to increase his power.
[4:17:32] <KeiPrime> in 5 you fight an evil tree from the void between worlds
[4:17:36] <Slimerick> I'm surprised the tone 5 has. it's a mainline FF and did some forms of humor that indies games from the mid 2000s
[4:17:37] <element_of_loyalty> This explains the loud meowing after pooping
[4:17:40] <blackbaron98> @Davifflaelan play 5 and 6
[4:17:41] <+GuelermeDias> 4, 5 and 6 are still pretty good
[4:17:42] <%rdark_ksu> ah he wont stop making the pee poops. got it
[4:17:45] <+jetrouverai> @grimsquirrel is the phone version good or nah?
[4:17:46] <+gralho> do you like apples, my dude?
[4:18:00] <%umbypokochan> i love how in the credits for 5 on PS1 it says "the The Void"
[4:18:05] <TerraWraith> Alrighty. So long as Mr. Peepee is ok. I have an old fur baby
[4:18:08] <+pacmanswang> Paige have you ever seen the FF trading card game? some of the art is gorgeous
[4:18:10] <Slimerick> the last third of 5 so got damn hard
[4:18:14] <+Skatedeandre> Butz
[4:18:15] <+gralho> cool
[4:18:15] <duke0fspook> Whatever Final Fantasy game you like most is the one that is the best
[4:18:16] <Worldbrand> oh that sounds great i'm gonna try that
[4:18:19] <TerraWraith> I'm also easily worried about everything
[4:18:24] <jeecay> >.> can you make apple pie?
[4:18:24] <@WoolyFish> Green apples are the best apples.
[4:18:26] <KeiPrime> except 13
[4:18:31] <jeecay> and then mail it to me?
[4:18:33] <+GrimSquirrel> @jetrouverai big problem withthe game is that there is no good port outside the original cart. and even that had translation problems
[4:18:36] <demonhunter790> That doesn’t sound very healthy
[4:18:38] <duke0fspook> Even 13, if that's your thing, I wont judge
[4:18:40] <+AntithesisEK> bacon wrapped and chicken saltimboca are always great
[4:18:45] <+rendingmelody> the suspense is killing me damit
[4:18:57] <+GuelermeDias> apples are just shit pears
[4:18:59] <+GrimSquirrel> @jetrouverai go for emulated translated snes port
[4:18:59] <Dingalow> This game's music is so bangin'
[4:19:01] <%TheGershon> M
[4:19:08] <%TheGershon> Just finish what you're saying first jesus
[4:19:12] <Eresus> @Davifflaelan plot wise, the only one that has aged well is FF6, but I would say that out of curiosity for the roots of the franchise, all of them are worth to give a shot
[4:19:17] <Animeshowfan> ok im gonna have to go its late. bye yall bye paige it was super fun watching yoru stream i hope elmo will be ok after the vets
[4:19:24] <SuperNotSuspiciousMan> is he just being a needy dick?
[4:19:28] <+jetrouverai> @grimsquirrel I will, thanks!
[4:19:33] <+GrimSquirrel> omg ff6 for a super nintendo game had over 100 tracks of music
[4:19:38] <AlasterAngelo> wait are we talking about pat or elmo
[4:19:43] <+AntithesisEK> descriptions of elmo always sound like it could be a werewolf
[4:19:43] <reonome> yes
[4:19:49] <+jediwatchman11> is rydia best final fantasy girl?
[4:19:50] <%Remery_> thats why you give him another cat to fuck with
[4:19:50] <%umbypokochan> my cat was being super lazy and couldn't walk right and it turned out he was constipated
[4:19:54] <+GuelermeDias> he was hanging out with pat, it probably rubbed off on him
[4:19:55] <+TeethMuncher> !uptime
[4:20:02] <Slimerick> @eresus 4 has a good focused story imo.
[4:20:08] <element_of_loyalty> Drink the Cranberry juice ELMO
[4:20:12] <blackbaron98> ff6 had some cinematic ass scenes for the graphics at the time
[4:20:20] <+GuelermeDias> rydia is a powerful ff girl
[4:20:22] <duke0fspook> @jediwatchman11 I mean Terra and Celes both make good arguments. People like that Aeris girl too.
[4:20:30] <+jediwatchman11> top tier
[4:20:33] <Slimerick> it's a nice traditionalist rpg like a dragon quest game.
[4:20:46] <@WoolyFish> Cuddle Elmo as soon as he's back.
[4:20:46] <+GuelermeDias> Faris is also a good FF girl
[4:20:50] <duke0fspook> Rydia definitely top 10, probably top 5
[4:20:52] <+jediwatchman11> I'll put Terra up with rydia
[4:20:53] <SuperNotSuspiciousMan> I finally got my cat operated after 6 years and now she's F A T in just a month.
[4:20:55] <+Mekhet09> You should try Breath of Fire 3 or Dragon Quest 3.
[4:20:56] <%heyitsbrian> the summons are technically a side quest
[4:21:13] <element_of_loyalty> FUGGINS
[4:21:19] <$KnivesEve> BAD FRIEND!
[4:21:29] <Slimerick> I'm lame and like Tifa lol.
[4:21:31] <Eresus> @Slimerick I think ff4 had a good story for its time, but by today standards is just too full of cliches
[4:21:41] <demonhunter790> I wish I had friends who slept through plans
[4:21:43] <+BoboDaHobo> Bunty should get on stream! That guy's awesome!
[4:21:51] <Davifflaelan> @PeachSaliva have you ever tied a small towel around Elmos middle
[4:21:51] <Ell1ot> no, Paige. We're your Bunty buddy now
[4:22:00] <duke0fspook> @Eresus It did create some of the cliches, though, ironically.
[4:22:01] <+jediwatchman11> I slept through plans to see a movie with a friend 3 times
[4:22:05] <jeecay> GAMERA?!
[4:22:16] <+jediwatchman11> in a row
[4:22:19] <element_of_loyalty> Cat Diaper
[4:22:19] <TerraWraith> Like a tiny cat apron
[4:22:21] <+Tokanova> he gains super powers
[4:22:24] <Dingalow> Have you ever gotten the Adamant Armour in this game?
[4:22:26] <%umbypokochan> Ed is ded
[4:22:27] <$MagickBurritoh> ever stuck a sticky note on him?
[4:22:30] <element_of_loyalty> FU ED
[4:22:35] <jeecay> he ded baby
[4:22:36] <@WoolyFish> F
[4:22:38] <%AbnormalVoid> Edward should probably be in the back lol
[4:22:39] <+Mekhet09> He'll be gone soon enough.
[4:22:40] <Slimerick> @duke0fspook yeah Aliens aged that way too.
[4:22:44] <+Razputin217> Edward in the front row LUL
[4:22:47] <+bearrier_> o no Edward is down how will we ever survive Kappa
[4:23:14] <SomersaultJustice> GASP
[4:23:18] <duke0fspook> I dunno, I think Aliens holds up pretty good. "Game over man!" LUL
[4:23:18] <TerraWraith> I like to take sticky notes and cut them so that I can give my cat angry eyebrows
[4:23:19] <Davifflaelan> @TerraWraith no. light a tea towel makes cats walk funny
[4:23:28] <+GuelermeDias> nice
[4:23:28] <element_of_loyalty> Ed is Expendable
[4:23:29] <jeecay> use coffee on those
[4:23:34] <%umbypokochan> i hated the DS version because they added sidequests that required you to get a super rare drop from these enemies
[4:23:34] <Intolerable> WOW
[4:23:36] <hntronium> I wonder if Paige would do better than Pat at Banner Saga
[4:23:37] <SomersaultJustice> use the rod to shoot the sexy arrows or something!
[4:23:40] <+GuelermeDias> ed is shit
[4:23:46] <+GuelermeDias> stupid spoony bard
[4:23:55] <@PlagueOfGripes> Edward learned he's useless
[4:23:56] <TerraWraith> @Davifflaelan I've already started drawing a cat wearing an apron though

[4:24:27] <%umbypokochan> edward is better in original (hard) version
[4:24:28] <PakuV2> Put Ed in the ground
[4:24:41] <Dingalow> I wish Edward would just make reviews again *sigh*
[4:24:42] <+GuelermeDias> put ed UNDERNEATH the ground imho
[4:24:47] <+bearrier_> he tries really hard guys
[4:24:48] <%umbypokochan> @Slimerick whoa, what? but... how would i know if it's a secret?? T_T

[4:25:16] <element_of_loyalty> click
[4:25:30] <Ell1ot> is Paige abandoning us?
[4:25:32] <PakuV2> Cecil looks like a linebacker from the front
[4:25:36] <duke0fspook> Pat should return in approximately: 21 Minutes
[4:25:46] <element_of_loyalty> As soon as Pat n Elmo get back she will ditch us
[4:26:06] <+OceanGovernor> Oh no is elmo sick?
[4:26:07] <duke0fspook> I don't fucking know
[4:26:14] <duke0fspook> I'm making shit up over her

[4:26:34] <Sheep_thrill> yeah CAN pat drive?
[4:26:34] <Yukisoda> I love when you kill a group of monsters and the same one pops up right after
[4:26:37] <+jediwatchman11> pat can see over the wheel?
[4:26:40] <Sheep_thrill> do his feet reach the pedals?
[4:26:45] <+OceanGovernor> rooAww Elmo having kittens
[4:26:45] <jeecay> whats the deal with that non-binary cloud in the back?
[4:26:49] <duke0fspook> Yeah how does pat get there
[4:26:57] <element_of_loyalty> Pat has baby seat for Cab
[4:27:02] <+GuelermeDias> at least the battle music is a banger
[4:27:05] <SomersaultJustice> it's lit fam. I'm sure no one has said this yet at all
[4:27:11] <Davifflaelan> how does Pat reach car door handle
[4:27:24] <duke0fspook> Okay he's only like 5'3" guys
[4:27:27] <prophetdisharmonious> If only it was that easy to find
[4:27:31] <duke0fspook> Which is still tiny
[4:27:31] <prophetdisharmonious> irl
[4:27:35] <gorsuch> wait was this game originally atb or was that just the remake
[4:27:38] <PakuV2> I can't believe how difficult the idea of Pat driving is to conceive
[4:27:44] <+OceanGovernor> Its very small, you could lift him up in your arms
[4:27:44] <element_of_loyalty> Pat has a Handicapped tag around his stomach
[4:27:45] <TheNeedlesD> I thought he was 5'2"
[4:27:50] <%Remery_> i thought he was 5'`1"
[4:27:51] <jeecay> it doesn't even begin to make up for all the life you've taken peach
[4:27:51] <+GuelermeDias> Pat is 5'1"
[4:27:53] <epylepticpanda> Can Pat reach to clean his butt?
[4:27:56] <Eresus> @Gogogolem ff4 was the first ff with the atb system
[4:27:57] <duke0fspook> My lies are getting more accurate!
[4:28:00] <Davifflaelan> @duke0fspook in our hearts Pats 2ft 5
[4:28:01] <+GuelermeDias> smol pat
[4:28:06] <PakuV2> Pat is approximately 1.7 large chocolate bunnies
[4:28:06] <Intolerable> Pat's 4'11"
[4:28:07] <mrdthedank> Hey Mustard Queen
[4:28:11] <gorsuch> thats what i thought
[4:28:12] <jeecay> Pat is a chibi
[4:28:14] <SuperNotSuspiciousMan> his hair tuft adds the 1"
[4:28:15] <Dingalow> Patlet
[4:28:18] <+AntithesisEK> 5'1 and a jar o' mustard
[4:28:18] <%AbnormalVoid> Pat's 4'3"
[4:28:19] <%Remery_> Pat is a pokemon that refuses to go back in his ball
[4:28:20] <@PlagueOfGripes> but 36, 24, 36
[4:28:23] <+skizzuto> wait is Pat actually 5'2''? I thought the smol Pat memes were just because Paige is tall
[4:28:24] <element_of_loyalty> Pats the Indian in the Cubbord
[4:28:30] <%Sinister_Aglet> pat is shrinking with every passing moment
[4:28:30] <%umbypokochan> but.. they're weak vs ice
[4:28:31] <+Skatedeandre> 4’11??????
[4:28:32] <AlasterAngelo> so paige isn't actually tall she just looks tall by comparison?
[4:28:35] <+GuelermeDias> no pat is very smol
[4:28:41] <+MechaBaphomet> I love that picture of "Normal size Pat"
[4:28:41] <Ell1ot> Pat's 4'
[4:28:42] <duke0fspook> Plague get your creepy measurements out of here
[4:28:43] <prophetdisharmonious> protec the pat
[4:28:43] <+OceanGovernor> Pat is a chibi man
[4:28:52] <Slimerick> come on Pat's just rotund
[4:28:53] <Vinniesaurus> how tall is page?
[4:28:54] <mercado94> I still can't get over his tiny hands holding a normal red bull can
[4:28:57] <%Remery_> Pat's a Shota
[4:28:58] <element_of_loyalty> Peach is Hour glass
[4:28:58] <PakuV2> What are pat's three sizes
[4:28:59] <CrimsonGargoyle> Pat is a fabulous bobblehead
[4:29:06] <+Mekhet09> charmed causes them to attack their allies or themselves.
[4:29:09] <%AbnormalVoid> Peach is also glass
[4:29:10] <+GuelermeDias> small, mini and toy?
[4:29:11] <SomersaultJustice> goblin summon drop I can feel it
[4:29:15] <%umbypokochan> you can see the secret walls
[4:29:21] <%Remery_> Pat's measurements
[4:29:23] <jeecay> so their combined genetics will make a reasonably sized child? or peter dinklidge in infinity war?
[4:29:24] <element_of_loyalty> Pat is a Yard Gnome Fashion Model
[4:29:24] <PakuV2> I assume it's 40,40,40 due to his brick shape
[4:29:25] <AncelDeLambert> 40 58 52
[4:29:30] <+GuelermeDias> seeseal
[4:29:31] <mrdthedank> Don't hate me, but I've literally never played FF
[4:29:49] <Slimerick> I remember one video where Woolie said 'feels like I' ve got a Pat hanging from my necklace'
[4:29:50] <duke0fspook> That's okay!
[4:29:53] <duke0fspook> We love everyone here!
[4:29:54] <PakuV2> @AncelDeLambert Those are some child bearing hips
[4:29:56] <Smolkupo> Sea sil? Isn't it seh-sil?

[4:30:04] <AncelDeLambert> He's a fecund man
[4:30:07] <duke0fspook> Well, it would be more accurate to say that we hate everyone equally
[4:30:12] <+GuelermeDias> the cecil wars have been fought for eternity
[4:30:15] <+Envisage> hehehe
[4:30:19] <+edenofthirdaccount> Hi Peachy! Question, would your daughter with pat be a nerd like you or be a total prep

[4:34:40] <hntronium> Thats pretty bad
[4:34:40] <element_of_loyalty> Kidney stones
[4:34:43] <AncelDeLambert> gotta change his catfood, nerts
[4:34:44] <%umbypokochan> Elmo is a Crystal Gem confirmed
[4:34:44] <+JenovasPuppet> Can you mine those?
[4:34:46] <Smolkupo> @PeachSaliva My cat had those, I just needed to keep him on special food
[4:34:47] <%thepantsking> Crystals are strangely relevant for a FF stream
[4:34:48] <+Fenlig> Cystals in them weiner mines
[4:34:49] <+jetrouverai> Baigon: real...crystal..
[4:34:50] <element_of_loyalty> DRANIO

[4:35:07] <element_of_loyalty> CLR
[4:35:08] <duke0fspook> @AngriestPat WHAT IS THE RECOMMENDATION
[4:35:11] <%Kinoskae> Special food, use corncob litter
[4:35:12] <@AngriestPat> if they find the crystals we change his food, give him medicine to make his Weiner less tough for a bit to let the stuff out and pain medicine
[4:35:12] <TerraWraith> They hurt like a kidney stone. They're pretty bad
[4:35:13] <+JenovasPuppet> Some people pay money for penis crystals.
[4:35:14] <Rellim80> They're called Kitty Stones.
[4:35:15] <%Remery_> SUCC out the crystals
[4:35:19] <prophetdisharmonious> ^

[4:41:34] <jeecay> gross
[4:41:35] <AncelDeLambert> Elmo love confirmed

[4:44:10] <+JenovasPuppet> We need one more viewer to get re-cursed.
[4:44:11] <hntronium> 666 viewers, this stream worships the glory of satan\

[4:44:18] <$Daggorth> Is Paige playing via an emulator? Or did the classic FFs get rereleased without my noticing?
[4:44:24] <$GohanEgret> emulator

[4:46:12] <reonome> paige is a vampire
[4:46:13] <+Mekhet09> Emulation isn't gone. There are a bunch of other emu sites.
[4:46:14] <+GuelermeDias> it's probably some weird ginger thing
[4:46:14] <Darren716> Wait then why do you always stream at 10 pm? This explains so much
[4:46:19] <@AngriestPat> REVERSE VAMPIRE
[4:46:22] <AncelDeLambert> I got the site name wrong
[4:46:25] <$Daggorth> There's a perk in Fallout which bumps up Intelligence and Perception at night. You must have the opposite. XD
[4:46:28] <bryanmildew> paige, like housecat, needs to take many naps throughout the day
[4:46:29] <%Kinoskae> I thought gingers feared the sun?
[4:46:30] <+Tokanova> i've been havin problems wit allergies n shit too. i got eczema in me eyelid

[4:47:07] <+OceanGovernor> Oh Paige is a firebender, explains the red hair

[4:47:10] <duke0fspook> @GuelermeDias Yes
[4:47:22] <%genowyn> Gawain
[4:47:23] <AncelDeLambert> she will LOVE him
[4:47:26] <%TheGershon> It's funny how everyone freaked out once emuparadise went down as if it was the only site with roms
[4:47:31] <CrimsonGargoyle> @umbypokochan LUL
[4:47:35] <prophetdisharmonious> the knight is Gawain btw
[4:47:35] <epylepticpanda> Are we having a 24 hour stream?
[4:47:38] <PakuV2> @GuelermeDias Once they're out of sight, it's too late. Turn around.
[4:47:42] <AncelDeLambert> it was a bad precedent, that's why
[4:47:42] <Slimerick> A lot of emu sites still have listings for Nintendo games but when you click on them it says 'this submission has been deleted'.
[4:47:46] <ValidVenasaur> The new update for Divinity came out today. Are you and Pat gonna play it?
[4:47:54] <+jediwatchman11> gawain and the green knight is fun
[4:47:55] <boldandsaucywrongs> The "ding dong" gets me every time

[4:48:42] <DedlokPM> @ValidVenasaur He said on twitter he is going to be waiting on it because he has too much on his plate at the moment what with hollow knight and warframe and what not
[4:48:53] <element_of_loyalty> Pat gets Cat drugs and returns
[4:49:09] <Slimerick> @mekhet09 you can still find them. I was downloading some GameCube games a few days ago just in case.
[4:49:10] <+GuelermeDias> skelmo mostly thinks about boning
[4:49:12] <+theTAT3R> which version of ff4 is this?
[4:49:12] <hntronium> Pat can do an 8 hour stream when he gets back
[4:49:14] <AncelDeLambert> We need Pat to lose his mind in the White Castle

[4:49:44] <+Mekhet09> Gamecube is too hard to run on my toaster. I just want some DS/SNES games.
[4:49:47] <@AngriestPat> it's almost like you can stream more when you aren't sleepy and dying
[4:49:47] <AncelDeLambert> Pat will never do Claire B
[4:49:50] <+GuelermeDias> the damned fifth weiner crystal
[4:49:53] <+GuelermeDias> or fourth
[4:49:56] <AlasterAngelo> some WHAT
[4:49:56] <Worldbrand> There's a problem with the crystals because Jupiter is in gatorade

[4:52:18] <+GuelermeDias> she's surprisingly healthy
[4:52:20] <element_of_loyalty> Paige has to be alive to be dying
[4:52:20] <PakuV2> If you hold Elmo up to the sun, at just the right angle, the light is magnified by his crystals and he fires Beam
[4:52:25] <%Remery_> Pat only lets Hot French Nurses play with his ass

[4:57:28] <TerraWraith> "Edward, I'm dead as shit, and it's super your fault!"
[4:57:31] <AncelDeLambert> Edward uses distraction! It's not very effective...
[4:57:33] <bryanmildew> that is not the dialogue
[4:57:35] <$GohanEgret> BELIEVE IN YOUR OWN JUSTICE

[4:58:38] <hntronium> HOW CAN THIS BE
[4:58:42] <+JenovasPuppet> "Hey your dad is here too, do you maybe want to say goodbye to him?" "Fuck that guy"
[4:58:46] <PakuV2> Anna left Edward to go fuck the Fishman
[4:58:48] <pectusumbra> *snort* that was good
[4:58:48] <duke0fspook> @KeiPrime Because ghost
[4:58:49] <Slimerick> life's but a walking shadow.....
[4:58:53] <TerraWraith> "Stop being such a dumb bitch, Edward!"

[4:59:16] <AncelDeLambert> Will Paige make it to the Paladin ceremony? How far away is that?
[4:59:18] <+jediwatchman11> @pakuv2 the shape of water
[4:59:22] <+GuelermeDias> seeseal, the greatest hero ever
[4:59:28] <Rellim80> Anna taught Paige to be Big and Strong.
[4:59:37] <+GuelermeDias> it's the next thing iirc
[4:59:45] <element_of_loyalty> Rydia n Rosa....KISS

[4:59:54] <Slimerick> wow that Rosa portrait looks pretty rough in this LUL
[4:59:58] <Ryo_no_Kage> @paige do you replace Attack with aim, I kinda remember Rosa having bad accuracy?
[5:00:00] <WisdomHat> "That's the do it"

[5:00:42] <TheNeedlesD> Paige move cecil to the 2nd slot and move Rosa to last slot
[5:00:48] <KeiPrime> this one is either two front three back or three front two back
[5:00:56] <Sloavon> ALRIGHT HELLO
[5:00:56] <SomersaultJustice> depending on formation, you eiher have 3 front / 2 back or 2 front / 3 back
[5:00:59] <Dingalow> honk
[5:01:02] <Vinniesaurus> switch with cecil
[5:01:07] <Slimerick> ugh this is like etrian odyssey
[5:01:12] <WaitHowDidIGetHere> @peachsaliva Keep Edward in front; use him as a human shield.
[5:01:13] <Dingalow> There we go!
[5:01:18] <+JenovasPuppet> Guess that works.
[5:01:19] <Eresus> it always like this in ff4
[5:01:30] <Eresus> it was always*
[5:01:30] <+JenovasPuppet> Harem
[5:01:34] <+GuelermeDias> edward away from the ladies
[5:01:34] <TheNeedlesD> You aren't lame, Ed deserves to be alone
[5:01:37] <AncelDeLambert> Edward can stand in the SHAME CORNER
[5:01:39] <+GuelermeDias> that's correct
[5:01:42] <$GohanEgret> edward gets nothing, cecil the pimp
[5:01:43] <+CrookedSpiral> you're thinking of 6
[5:01:44] <+skizzuto> yeah this game is weird where the slots alternate front and back and change just switches which one you have three of
[5:01:44] <Dingalow> It was always like this in 4
[5:01:46] <element_of_loyalty> Edward the less Deserves it
[5:01:48] <+bearrier_> Edward in exile as it should be Kappa
[5:01:49] <%Remery_> Give Cecil his Harem
[5:01:50] <AncelDeLambert> Cecil is pimp with all the honeys
[5:01:51] <duke0fspook> 6 is the game where these things occur
[5:02:08] <Mr_Strut> Platinum
[5:02:08] <+GuelermeDias> don't worry about it
[5:02:12] <$joylent_blue> no its fine
[5:02:16] <+JenovasPuppet> Also brown skin on all the overworld sprites
[5:02:16] <wordNumber> 4 is the only game with rows that works like this
[5:02:17] <Dingalow> This game is weird
[5:02:17] <Sloavon> pale blond?
[5:02:18] <Mr_Strut> The color is platinum blonde.
[5:02:18] <mercado94> Art is hard
[5:02:18] <+Saggitori> gold bond
[5:02:18] <TheNeedlesD> well Cecil's battle mode has like Crow Eyes
[5:02:18] <PakuV2> They used all the brown for the Antlion
[5:02:19] <+MisterTylerrr> Shit PLATINUM
[5:02:19] <duke0fspook> She's a platinum
[5:02:21] <+Tokanova> why DOES rydia have green hair
[5:02:23] <element_of_loyalty> CRAZY PEACH
[5:02:26] <bryanmildew> maybe they want her to stick out
[5:02:26] <Yukisoda> Her hair is yellow
[5:02:26] <boldandsaucywrongs> Paige hating more women
[5:02:29] <AncelDeLambert> @peachsaliva it's probably illusions caused by the background color
[5:02:30] <pectusumbra> anime white
[5:02:32] <rytisone> it's all lighting
[5:02:33] <TheNeedlesD> Pat's still alive?
[5:02:36] <+RSNoon> Platinum blond is best blond
[5:02:44] <+AntithesisEK> the town of Mist had a lot of chlorophyll in the water
[5:02:44] <+GuelermeDias> @Tokanova she's not old enough for it to be ripe

[5:04:00] <+AntithesisEK> LUL
[5:04:00] <+JenovasPuppet> Even if you got the exact same markings, Elmo's particular brand of crazy cannot be replicated.
[5:04:00] <$joylent_blue> SAY IT, CECIL
[5:04:02] <+ItsYaGirlMaria> Sons of Elmo
[5:04:03] <+jediwatchman11> nice one cecil

[5:04:05] <TerraWraith> "That i super caused"
[5:04:08] <%abadbadman> She's scared of Fire because it's hot and it hurts to touch
[5:04:10] <Dingalow> She gets over her trauma in a single cutscene
[5:04:10] <Mr_Strut> It's not like Cecil planned that shit
[5:04:10] <+AntithesisEK> WHO EQUIPPED THE BOMB RING CECIL, WHO!
[5:04:11] <+DrThwack> attempting to replicate the elmo is blaspemy
[5:04:12] <+MisterTylerrr> Even if the new cat were to look like Elmo, Paige would be able to tell if his brain works good or not
[5:04:12] <Yukisoda> What a weenie. Afriad of the fire I caused
[5:04:14] <Mr_Strut> He was just a patsy
[5:04:18] <element_of_loyalty> FAB BU

[5:05:05] <TerraWraith> CHILDHOOD TRAUMA x1 OBTAINED

[5:05:09] <Dingalow> More therapists should do that for people with PTSD. Just go "Come ooooon!"
[5:05:09] <+Mekhet09> You killed her mom before the fire.
[5:05:16] <+GuelermeDias> well it's easier now that she's blown up
[5:05:23] <PakuV2> Rydia, you MUST use the gun that destroyed your bloodline
[5:05:24] <shoryukenabotch> Rydia puts up with everyones shit
[5:05:27] <AncelDeLambert> does she freak out around the campfire every night?

[5:05:59] <%thepantsking> @PeachSaliva Have you played the port of this on the DS? It was my second FF game and possibly my favorite RPG ever.
[5:06:03] <PakuV2> She cries when she sees the sun
[5:06:06] <emoonimoo> Rydia: "I must'nt run away, I must'nt run away!"

[5:11:45] <$GohanEgret> elmo is immortal
[5:11:54] <+skizzuto> another gameplay tip: use the aim command with Rosa instead of fight; it does the same damage but doesn't miss
[5:11:54] <OkamiDude15> pat went to buy chocolate and theres no way you can stop him
[5:11:58] <+generalve> :(
[5:11:59] <KaiserMario> Why don't you clone him?

[5:18:27] <bryanmildew> you must be thinking of the other peach/paige
[5:18:29] <JeedyJay> The GBA version has less nonsense lines, but stays pretty goofy.
[5:18:31] <Yukisoda> Pretty sure it's fixed in most versions after this
[5:18:37] <element_of_loyalty> Better Paige would do it
[5:18:37] <Eresus> I may be wrong but the first retranslation of ff4 was for the gba version
