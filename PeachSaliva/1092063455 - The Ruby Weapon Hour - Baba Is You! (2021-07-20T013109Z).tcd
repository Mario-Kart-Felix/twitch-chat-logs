[0:13:00] <BigFingerRo> Do you have food to be sad with?
[0:13:01] <drawerinkshow> What is a Baba?
[0:13:01] <+Lunarhawk> Word around the street is Baba is Crab
[0:13:03] <Aiutare47> It’s some of my favorite streams
[0:13:12] <+kitdude192> Hard to believe I watched it live.
[0:13:16] <%Sick_Haystacks> HURTY SAND
[0:13:17] <DazzlingFuhrer> If flag is win, and paige is you, then who is baba?
[0:13:18] <coldfire0007> Baba was the friends we made along the way
[0:13:18] <theshillman> preemptive sadsketti
[0:13:18] <%Sick_Haystacks> for bab
[0:13:20] <+abrupt_abe> That stream is infinitely rewatchable
[0:13:21] <ergulor> is it flat?
[0:13:21] <BoneSkore> baba will offer you no quarter
[0:13:21] <%chance_h> Is the coke warm?
[0:13:22] <%Dakuu75> #unsponsored
[0:13:22] <%thejimjamz> He ceases to be
[0:13:23] <%Ranryu692> so every coke zero?
[0:13:23] <+HiroTSK5> Just to make sure: Are you Baba or is Baba you?
[0:13:24] <$Sphincter_Spelunker> didn't coke change the recipe again
[0:13:29] <DrStinkers> Everyone asks who is BABA, nobody asks how is BABA...
[0:13:30] <cache_22> Is the Coke Zero just flat or just bad in general?
[0:13:30] <Wiiplayah43> Who is Baba? The greatest philosophical question of our time.
[0:13:35] <Madovir> evergreen content
[0:13:35] <KazairLux> I had sadghetti for dinner too
[0:13:37] <GabiTheMermaid> How was your day Paige
[0:13:40] <tank7013> Just remember that you are not baba, you will not cease to be
[0:13:46] <drawerinkshow> Baba = Saliva in spanish

[0:14:16] <Six_The_Ripper> starch allergy???
[0:14:17] <CappuccinoGuil> how did you guess that?
[0:14:17] <DrStinkers> Fuzzy potatoes?
[0:14:18] <$JoshManVGH> Any chance it's just the skin?
[0:14:19] <KeiganOfAstora> Hoping for new DS3 episode this week/weekend :)
[0:14:19] <marvel877> was it the potato or the oil it was cooked in?
[0:14:19] <+Piemen99> Oh god I was not prepared for this
[0:14:19] <KazairLux> that blows! potatoes are so good
[0:14:20] <B1ak3N1k05999> Oh no
[0:14:20] <%Dakuu75> she's not allergic to those fake wac donalds fries
[0:14:20] <+velemi> Paige are you inventing new weaknesses for yourself
[0:14:21] <mudamudajo> aw fuck I can't believe you've done this.
[0:14:23] <+Lunarhawk> Cant believe Paiges allergies are gonna force her to eat healthy
[0:14:23] <$velgaduere> eat fuzzy, get dizzy
[0:14:24] <$Sphincter_Spelunker> Boil a potato in water. You need a control before a conclusion
[0:14:28] <no123450n> was it fermented?
[0:14:29] <%Sick_Haystacks> That may legit be aging
[0:14:30] <HaroldDonchee> a ginger allergic to potatoes? weirdd
[0:14:31] <%ssjklyco> Cook a tater tomorrow with no seasoning and see if it happens
[0:14:33] <Mirakei> Baba is you. Baba is me, Baba is us. Baba is nobody. Baba is everybody.
[0:14:33] <+abrupt_abe> @Chimeraelite How dare the game be down during Make It Rain

[0:14:47] <B1ak3N1k05999> Yeah Pat explain on the podcast
[0:14:47] <StencilOST> This is an impossible amount of peach/week
[0:14:48] <heartlesshealer> Was it the same as the Pineapple feeling?
[0:14:49] <+SoySocks> were they plain, or anything added?
[0:14:53] <DrStinkers> itchy ..fuzzy..tasty
[0:14:54] <Mundkipz> Moldy potatoes
[0:14:54] <GravyLangley> old mold potatoes
[0:14:54] <+leupinvergon> Food ptsd
[0:14:57] <BoneSkore> Paige: eats. also Paige: suffers out of nowhere
[0:14:58] <$Puhff> Were they glass potatoes????
[0:15:01] <mayormanders> Maybe not enough potatoes
[0:15:06] <+kitdude192> Aww.
[0:15:08] <%Sick_Haystacks> ageing or maybe diabetes, for real
[0:15:10] <GabiTheMermaid> Yeah that makes sense, sucks though
[0:15:11] <depotagents> peach.....
[0:15:12] <%Dakuu75> I've never heard this...
[0:15:15] <Shnikkles> omigosh more BABA
[0:15:15] <+493x> you've grown too powerful, so the universe needed to nerf you again
[0:15:18] <no123450n> eat more daylight plants
[0:15:18] <%chance_h> No more Carrots!
[0:15:18] <%Ziegsy> Paige can no longer go to ireland
[0:15:19] <SomeOtherNeb> but you've been having McDonalds for YEARS and you're still alive?
[0:15:20] <tank7013> Are we certain that Pat did not poison the potatoes
[0:15:20] <JaseHateRadio> i love tomatoes too
[0:15:20] <$Sphincter_Spelunker> Adds new oil. Must be the nighshades
[0:15:22] <+realm_forge> @peachsaliva have you tried a keto diet? I solved a lot of my own health issues when I made the switch
[0:15:23] <%holydeviant1> Try a third nightshade to be sure!
[0:15:25] <SomeOtherNeb> it's 80% potatoes
[0:15:25] <+potatoman153> BibleThump BibleThump BibleThump
[0:15:26] <buuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuut> Poison allergy
[0:15:26] <BoxNavy> :)
[0:15:26] <heartlesshealer> oh no, I thought pat was messing with us
[0:15:28] <%Ranryu692> Peach hates the Irish and Italians confirmed
[0:15:30] <lotharrio> Put a bomb in the tomato.
[0:15:31] <JaseHateRadio> i'd be hella sad if i couldn't eat tomatoes
[0:15:34] <ne0bunny> cut to later and shes drinking potato juice
[0:15:34] <%patriotrenegade> But Baba
[0:15:37] <%Dakuu75> are Potatoes and Tomatoes the emo veggies? ("Nightshade")
[0:15:38] <mudamudajo> No more Wcdonalds French fries!?!
[0:15:39] <nibble_nuts> paige is actually just allergic to good health
[0:15:40] <+leupinvergon> Potatoes are tubers
[0:15:43] <Ner234> You can just suddenly get an allergy like that
[0:15:44] <Ombrebird> french fry addiction destroyed
[0:15:44] <KazairLux> hopefully it's the new oil
[0:15:47] <%PunkMcFox> Raw fruit and veggies make my mouth itch bad. I hate it so much cause I love fruits!
[0:15:48] <Madovir> fodmap?
[0:15:56] <%Dakuu75> @nibble_nuts I believe it
[0:16:02] <KingSwansJamboree> the universe has to counteract the glasses you're getting so you stay debuffed
[0:16:04] <%potatodono_> that would be super sad. I'm currently growing tomatoes in my garden.
[0:16:05] <%Lion_kun> Do you still pretty yourself up for your v tuber streams or do you take advantage of them to be more comfortable?
[0:16:08] <mangled_marionette> i thought I couldnt eat many things cause im allergic to most nuts, dairy and mangos..... but tomatoes would be rough
[0:16:08] <+TheLakinessMonster> What was the oil that you cooked the potatoes with?
[0:16:18] <+shruke> a potato on the internet is a vtuber
[0:16:21] <%doomunderthestairs> das what I did basically and it helped me lose 50lbs
[0:16:24] <GarbageQueenEllie> Hallo Baba
[0:16:25] <+realm_forge> Gotcha that sounds cool!
[0:16:27] <+lordericter> I almost forgot about the BABA
[0:16:30] <%Dakuu75> @PeachSaliva I like how you kept stealing Pat's drink during the podcast~
[0:16:31] <BigFingerRo> Peach, I'm worried that you're stalling The Babaning
[0:16:33] <SomeOtherNeb> wouldn't avocado oil be extra fatty and hard to digest?
[0:16:35] <Jolly_Adventurer> @PeachSaliva What did your ancestors do to get you cursed with such a fragile, broken body and system?
[0:16:36] <%dankjerri> you turn yourself into a blank slate for food testing
[0:16:36] <+Lunarhawk> Well there's your problem, Avocado is gross and its no surprise it got you sick
[0:16:40] <Mirakei> elimination diet for people with inflammatory and immune system issues is a good idea.
[0:16:42] <GravyLangley> "filled this glass bottle with ether"
[0:16:42] <blakeway> <3 my brother has a fodmap intolerance and he did a similar exclusion diet - I know how bad it sucks. stay big <3
[0:16:45] <+Ches_Neckbeard> avocado oil, canola oil or POISON because it's Paige
[0:16:46] <+TheLakinessMonster> I don't trust this whatsoever. That is some sketch oil.
[0:16:47] <%Ranryu692> you're allergic to Canada Oil?
[0:16:50] <theshillman> @Lunarhawk boooo
[0:16:55] <$Sphincter_Spelunker> labels are useful
[0:16:56] <+Prism_Zet> Baba shadow puzzles
[0:16:57] <%ComfortableStranger> oh no.....
[0:16:58] <$velgaduere> fingies crosstuh
[0:16:58] <SomeOtherNeb> maybe Pat is finally poisoning you for real this time
[0:16:59] <%Lion_kun> Paige, why can't you just eat the same things? Why must you experiment with different oils?
[0:17:01] <sydowoodo> you mean maple syrup?
[0:17:01] <boomstickery> I cant have sesame oil, destroys my guts
[0:17:01] <KingSwansJamboree> my mom's allergic to avocado, maybe check that
[0:17:01] <%ssjklyco> Maybe the avocado oil. Most people have a mild allergy to avocado where they just have itchy throats, but nothing life threatening
[0:17:05] <+zamatermort> Bagged oil
[0:17:14] <%Dakuu75> Canada Oil is just Maple syrup. they uswe that shit for everything
[0:17:22] <%ComfortableStranger> but why does the girl have fangs?
[0:17:26] <+pingpong7045> Canola is short for "Canada Ola"
[0:17:30] <GarbageQueenEllie> cheese oil
[0:17:31] <%dankjerri> can they even make french fries in canada, or do they call them some weird Quebec shit
[0:17:34] <+pingpong7045> Which means oil
[0:17:37] <%Sick_Haystacks> experimentation with food is the spice of life
[0:17:37] <$velgaduere> angangang

[0:57:00] <%sick_kickflips> dude
[0:57:07] <@SoFarFetched> @Walopoh whenever paige gets around to doing that,because she has to add that herself
[0:57:08] <mustachegolem> skull is hot
[0:57:12] <%Dakuu75> "wall & flag is win" but she became the wall and fucking murdered the jelly fish, holy shit. that was amazing.
[0:57:12] <+TopTieramisu> yes! didn't miss this
[0:57:13] <+Scevda> As a general point of advice, I hope you would internalize this idea: Baba (a sheep) is merely a veseel for your existence (called YOU in this case) Baba is merely A SKELETON. you can wear many SKELETONS, AND if you have the right setup, you can wear many SKELETONS at the same time.
[0:57:13] <+Maleicus> what if crab
[0:57:18] <+Prism_Zet> sink is like
[0:57:18] <@SoFarFetched> SEE CHAT SHE IS NOW ASKING
[0:57:18] <iosephe> Sink is Sink
[0:57:19] <DracaenaLeaf> death
[0:57:19] <%JenovasPuppet> Star is Sink
[0:57:19] <+Prism_Zet> a hole
[0:57:19] <%maenos2> it means die
[0:57:21] <DazzlingFuhrer> It's that thing in the kitchen, paige.
[0:57:22] <$TIME_PUNCHER> sink is break
[0:57:22] <@commanderclaw> The starfish
[0:57:22] <BoxNavy> can you help me what is sink
[0:57:23] <+Angelnickl> Sink is bad.
[0:57:23] <%Keyd00d> sink and die
[0:57:23] <LightningLynx89> Is Sink means you die if you walk into it
[0:57:24] <%Starotter70> What IS Sink?
[0:57:24] <CappuccinoGuil> it sinks anything that touches it
[0:57:24] <marvel877> death
[0:57:24] <JobbedBone> sink deletes both when they overlap
[0:57:24] <EuropanLamprey> Sink is kill
[0:57:25] <%ssjklyco> It cleans your dishes
[0:57:25] <Madovir> sink fills in a hole
[0:57:26] <%AncelDeLambert> sink means that you destroy two objects when they collide
[0:57:26] <gslayer14> sink is make thing sink when touch other thing
[0:57:26] <mustachegolem> baba is the mech
[0:57:27] <$Niney_Who> Sink is die
[0:57:27] <%FacetiousAF> SINK IS DIE
[0:57:27] <coldfire0007> Sink bad
[0:57:27] <zzNamttamzz> touch star
[0:57:28] <+velemi> if something is on a thing that is sink, it goes away
[0:57:29] <HyperionXV> Sink means overlap causes deletion
[0:57:29] <+RealThiele> sink is wash
[0:57:29] <rinharty6e> sink gose down?
[0:57:29] <Zarkith> A bowl with plumbing for water to flow and clean things
[0:57:30] <BlueSpartan119> Sink is Defeat?
[0:57:30] <lotharrio> Sink is mutual destruction.
[0:57:30] <$Sphincter_Spelunker> SInk is where you wash hands
[0:57:31] <Monkeyweed21> anything that touches sinks and it dies
[0:57:31] <heartlesshealer> swallow if touch
[0:57:31] <%nichos7> If you touch a Sink object
[0:57:32] <TheLemuroid> Sink means it is like a hole that you can fill
[0:57:32] <+captain_thickthighs> sink is down
[0:57:33] <corpsegoo> sink sinks object
[0:57:33] <%skm742> sink = you and sink thing die
[0:57:33] <BoxNavy> sink deletes things
[0:57:33] <ToneBacas> sink is mutual death i think
[0:57:33] <%Nox_Ludicro> You touch it and you sink
[0:57:34] <%king_wragles> @PeachSaliva any object that touches an object with sink will destroy both objects
[0:57:35] <%ItsRatman> That's what's in your kitchen
[0:57:35] <%nichos7> You fall in a hole
[0:57:36] <+Prism_Zet> its not exactly the same as death, cuase it neutralizes whatever hit it
[0:57:36] <TheFramedWarlock> Sink kills whatever it touches
[0:57:36] <$TIME_PUNCHER> sink kill all
[0:57:37] <CappuccinoGuil> Sink is Melt
[0:57:37] <OldOnyx> sink is drown
[0:57:38] <ShadeTheNovice> sink makes a symbol disappear if it touches another symbol
[0:57:39] <%nichos7> But then that hole is filled
[0:57:40] <%OddballEA> sink make thing fall down water
[0:57:41] <Slimeking_Mike> Sink is if something enters it, it is destroyed
[0:57:41] <pabloelenano2> @PeachSaliva go down below the surface of something, especially of a liquid; become submerged
[0:57:41] <StrapStreams> Sink is float
[0:57:41] <@Jekado> sink causes things to cancel
[0:57:42] <$PinkertonDanPie> sink is go away
[0:57:44] <+SenorCounter> Sink is null
[0:57:45] <DazzlingFuhrer> sink destroys objects
[0:57:45] <banananutcake> the sink item also disappears
[0:57:45] <raveous> Sink and defeat are different
[0:57:46] <crob91> Sink removes thing it touches
[0:57:46] <+talon84> It's a boy band from the late 90s-early 2000s
[0:57:47] <+Mendin> Sink is DELETE, not Die
[0:57:49] <$TIME_PUNCHER> defeat is lose, sink is kill
[0:57:50] <GildedZephyr> Sink makes it so when two objects touch they destroy each other
[0:57:51] <Frodiddly> everyone trying to explain to paige that BABA is not YOU, this has been done so many times hahaha
[0:57:53] <balthazar758> sink defeated
[0:57:53] <Madovir> sink can fill in the tile
[0:57:54] <%Fooguwu> sink = mutual destruction
[0:57:55] <+rosed007> sink is drown
[0:57:56] <+SenorCounter> so yeah sink does=die
[0:57:57] <lotharrio> Sink is mutual destruction
[0:57:57] <ArtoriasTheTrenchfighter> Sink isn't countered by anything in this level, I think float ignores it
[0:57:57] <devanmuse> sink disappears after something touches it
[0:57:58] <DrStinkers> Sink is a hole, something that touches sink fills it and disapears
[0:57:58] <+MoroseLoki> I'm so confused 😕 😐
[0:57:58] <sourdough_scones> sink destroys both you and sink thing
[0:57:59] <banananutcake> defeat doesn't delete object when you touch, sink does
[0:58:00] <%skm742> sink also break itself
[0:58:00] <+razielhex> so you could push the star into the skull, then sink it?
[0:58:01] <%JenovasPuppet> Sink is one thing kills it and the thing that is sinking
[0:58:01] <+skylerpilot> if it is sink, then stuff sinks into it and disappears
[0:58:01] <iosephe> Sink is not defeat, but defeat and sink is die
[0:58:02] <BigFingerRo> @talon84 You missed an N there bud
[0:58:03] <ToneBacas> both objects are gone when one of them is sink
[0:58:04] <StrapStreams> Sink is full
[0:58:05] <+RealThiele> sink can be powered through vs defeat
[0:58:07] <mustachegolem> defeat kill only the current you
[0:58:14] <$PinkertonDanPie> sink can kill more than just baba
[0:58:16] <cherrycottontail> DEFEAT = LOSE, SINK = DIE.
[0:58:19] <+Undenizen> oh no. peach, why would you come back to this? you can't see!
[0:58:24] <Tabonline> Sink dies and takes you with it
[0:58:26] <%FacetiousAF> really?

[1:31:07] <Jathspuh> Hmm

[1:58:07] <+strakillias> Try running the game in borderless window

[1:58:11] <ToneBacas> change the resolution in the game
[1:58:11] <corn_dad> Stream is kill

[1:59:19] <heartlesshealer> LUL
[1:59:20] <%Dakuu75> idk if changing the game to Full screen or windowed might help?
[1:59:20] <%peyodogo> go to options, then whatever looks like graphics options, then change the resolution
[1:59:22] <BoxNavy> yeah sure float
[1:59:23] <KitsuneCrew> change resolution in game options
[1:59:23] <%Bt_Robot> Just rename yourself "Duke Mirage" and everything will be fine
[1:59:24] <leargo> yeah
[1:59:25] <Rellim80> Find another Vtuber that's live and ask them what to do
[1:59:25] <%holydeviant1> Resolution might be the problem
[1:59:27] <MrChaosDoughnut> Elmo tech support? I can dig it.

[1:59:41] <LifesNeverHumDrum> i dont mind float lol
[1:59:42] <$Niney_Who> the IN GAME Resolution
[1:59:44] <%Nox_Ludicro> The game itself
[1:59:45] <@SoFarFetched> Worst case scenario is you remove vtuber.
[1:59:45] <%spitelite> no the game
[1:59:46] <%YakumoYomi> In-game options
[1:59:48] <%peyodogo> floating is also ok tbh
[1:59:48] <+Sendrak70> Over compensate? Move yourself off screen outside of the game so when you tab in your in the right spot?

[2:26:45] <bettysharkface> The secret to lucid dream, is when you realize you are dreaming, spin in your dream. This can also work if you wake up, you don't open your eyes, just think about the dream you were having and spiiiiin.

[3:10:18] <+zamatermort> P E R S P E C T I V E
[3:10:20] <jowi_time> you go big guy
[3:10:27] <infinityk11> big but not large
[3:10:29] <LifesNeverHumDrum> be close, THEN be far
[3:10:36] <allanmiri> Big Mclarge Huge.
[3:10:46] <Hydrapissed> monkaS
[3:10:49] <+vdalson> i need the biggest die you have. no that's too big
[3:10:49] <Little_xim> What chapter is this chat
[3:10:50] <+TopTieramisu> monkaS
[3:10:52] <OtterExpress> i gotta say, the piano music in this game is really soothing
[3:10:56] <%samTUMZfestival> :O
[3:10:57] <infinityk11> good lord
[3:10:59] <SwindlerOfProgress> It can be, I suppose
[3:10:59] <+MisterAvry> I wish
[3:10:59] <+TopTieramisu> i felt that
[3:11:02] <CaliginousAntic> more like nightmare than lucid dreaming
[3:11:02] <LifesNeverHumDrum> :O
[3:11:03] <JojoAndTheAfroRobo> ok that one made no sense lol
[3:11:04] <%wolfregis> Huh, this looks interesting and clever.
[3:11:06] <%CubicPhantom> yeah, you know you're lucid dreaming when you hear Dr. Glenn Pearce. It's like that for everyone
[3:11:07] <infinityk11> is this hell?
[3:11:10] <gespenstkick> Heck no, this is what sleep paralysis is like
[3:11:11] <allanmiri> Lucid dreaming is being aware you're dreaming and having control over said dream.
[3:11:12] <+MisterAvry> I usually just fail to fly and then wake up
[3:11:14] <Hydrapissed> I bet pat fell asleep to the piano
[3:11:18] <Little_xim> No lucid dreaming is just where you control your actions. This is more akin to sleep paralysis
[3:11:19] <+RealThiele> Fridge Largemeat!
[3:11:20] <+ratchetex> the one lucid dream I can remember I was just like, huh what if I try flying for a bit
[3:11:20] <LifesNeverHumDrum> i can feel the effects
[3:11:23] <Hydrapissed> and the fish fox
[3:11:24] <+MiraLangsuir> This is something like lucid dreaming to me.
[3:11:24] <+The_Protagonist> fish
[3:11:26] <%samTUMZfestival> The chewing!
[3:11:26] <funkerbuster> OH come on
[3:11:29] <%GabeSweetMan> Monch
[3:11:30] <%AncelDeLambert> Art thou feeling it now Mr Krabs?
[3:11:35] <+Taisuru> Fish fox
[3:11:35] <@MelBrooksKA> okay, have a good night everyone
[3:11:37] <$NitronStreams> Good Morning
[3:11:39] <$GarbageNirvana> When I'm lucid dreaming it feels like I and everyone in the dream are actors
[3:11:40] <Little_xim> My last dream was a lucid dream
[3:11:40] <%samTUMZfestival> Teeheeheee
[3:11:41] <+BigNerdSam> The mustard is really kicking in now.
[3:11:45] <allanmiri> I think lucid dreaming is how Ruvick had powers in Evil Within One.
[3:11:46] <LifesNeverHumDrum> nyomnyom
[3:11:47] <%wolfregis> I'm kind of getting Stanley Parable vibes from this.
[3:11:49] <%GabeSweetMan> G'night Mel
[3:11:49] <+fromnibelheim> when I realize I'm lucid I'm always stunned by all the beautiful detail and take it in until the dream changes
[3:11:50] <$NitronStreams> Hello, my name is Doctor Glenn Pierce.

[3:21:04] <Captainahab_37> I think you may have fucked up a teensy bit
[3:21:07] <Dunmarkh> no you just made this much harder for yourself
[3:21:07] <JanusII> They didn't expect you to use it as a ramp just jump up the lower ledge.
[3:21:08] <+MisterAvry> shadow puzzles redux
[3:21:09] <Solidus_113> checkpoint it
[3:21:12] <Slimeking_Mike> You can still do it it'll just be. tougher
[3:21:14] <Coystick> How did you manage this?
[3:21:20] <+Taisuru> Load checkpoint
[3:21:22] <Wizdom_Cube> NotLikehis
[3:21:23] <+CptBritches> Pray to the lord for forgiveness
[3:21:25] <Little_xim> Load checkpoint
[3:21:30] <newtmcgoot> This seemed like a pretty easy mistake to make
[3:21:30] <JanusII> If you can see the light you can pick it up again though.
[3:21:31] <+MisterAvry> yeah
[3:21:32] <eyeobject> LUL LUL LUL LUL
[3:21:35] <+polothegreatest> darkness imprisoned me
[3:21:39] <CzeekyTV> 3 minutes
[3:21:41] <+Hilleltaco> It says, 3 minutes
[3:21:42] <gespenstkick> it tells you
[3:21:42] <BoxNavy> 3 hours :)
[3:21:42] <JanusII> It says.
[3:21:42] <%Kenzo2000> i wonder
[3:21:43] <+Taisuru> 3 minutes
[3:21:43] <lotharrio> 3 minutes ago
[3:21:43] <CaliginousAntic> 3 minutes
[3:21:45] <%GabeSweetMan> 3 minutes? Nah.
[3:21:45] <JanusII> 3:07
[3:21:45] <+JusTTheGuyYouNeed> 3 minutes
[3:21:46] <OtterExpress> pray to the lord for forgigv
[3:21:46] <+MisterAvry> 3 minutes and seven seconds
[3:21:46] <heartlesshealer> Three minutes
[3:21:47] <%GabeSweetMan> Just do it.
[3:21:47] <+derpy_platypus> speedrun
[3:21:47] <+RealThiele> BURY THE LIGHT DEEP WITHIN
[3:21:48] <$NitronStreams> its fine
[3:21:49] <valeriOS_> 3:07
[3:21:49] <+CptBritches> It says the exact time
[3:21:50] <+bad_luck_luke> just do it
[3:21:52] <%Ranryu692> it says it right there
[3:21:55] <heartlesshealer> it's okay -enough-
[3:21:56] <+CptBritches> ;)
[3:22:01] <+RandyFistburgers> all good
[3:22:02] <allanmiri> Nothing changes cause it's all the same the world's you get is the one you give away, it all just happens again way down the line.
[3:22:06] <leovaldezking> cast aside theres no going home
[3:22:08] <%GabeSweetMan> I wish MORE games would show that timer.
[3:22:09] <Dunmarkh> Why
[3:22:10] <Little_xim> :)
[3:22:13] <infinityk11> big large
[3:22:21] <TurtlesAndTentacles> The issue is you keep bashing your head forward. TAKE YOUR TIME.
[3:22:22] <%EyeFarted> LIGHT IS NOT LADDER
[3:22:23] <carrion_king_> That's a cool mechanic, I wish all games tracked how long it's been since you last saved
[3:22:23] <%GabeSweetMan> Nothing's worse than loading a checkpoint, having it be an hour ago, and no way to undo it.
[3:22:27] <Little_xim> @gabesweetman yeah these devs were wicked smatt
[3:22:39] <gespenstkick> Peach saying "make big" while randomly dropping objects like it's a spell
[3:22:46] <%EyeFarted> THERE WAS A LOWER STEP
[3:23:00] <$NitronStreams> 👏👏👏👏
[3:23:01] <+RealThiele> you. did it.

[3:23:27] <allanmiri> No a lot of games these days that have darkness be DARK. As in you can't see shit without a light.
[3:23:28] <OtterExpress> i like root beer
[3:23:29] <+RealThiele> water flavor

[3:24:58] <allanmiri> Speaking of darkness. I played Life Line (I think it's called that) as a kid. I didn't know about the 'doing a racist Japanese accent' trick to get the lady to understand you better trick so I never got past the part with the pitch black room.
[3:25:04] <cs0402196> Breathing down your neck
[3:25:19] <LifesNeverHumDrum> knife ceases to be!!

[3:26:00] <%Ranryu692> why did the schedule say murder then?

[3:26:15] <infinityk11> big beans
[3:26:15] <@SoFarFetched> @allanmiri well its more that Japanese people don't pronounce words they way American people do because of how things are written. The L doesn't really exist in the Japan Language so it has to be R.
[3:26:16] <OtterExpress> BIG BEAN
[3:26:19] <%GabeSweetMan> Fieth's eh?

[3:28:00] <Captainahab_37> wahdur
[3:28:02] <allanmiri> The sad part is, I think Life Line had a good idea in that you were trapped in a room with someone on the outside trying to help you out, but it just didn't work out.
[3:28:06] <OtterExpress> Wadder soder
[3:28:20] <Captainahab_37> is it 1am again

[3:39:03] <+RandyFistburgers> gudgud
[3:39:06] <%Dakuu75> w/e it was, I bet it was the fandom's fault
[3:39:06] <heartlesshealer> ???????
[3:39:06] <Shnikkles> wut
[3:39:09] <+derpy_platypus> seem clips, looks cool
[3:39:10] <Captainahab_37> The Maopranos
[3:39:13] <+Mr_y1096> creator said he didnt think two characters were gay
[3:39:14] <DXLelouch24> ***
[3:39:15] <OtterExpress> i can't watch it, i dont have eyes or ears
[3:39:19] <%Ranryu692> I used to know an ugly, unfriendly cat named mao mao
[3:39:23] <BoxNavy> da fambly
[3:39:25] <lotharrio> It got canceled and the creator/show runner found out through twitter.
[3:39:28] <+RandyFistburgers> whats that hbo survival show??
[3:39:28] <fairore> @Mr_y1096 lol
[3:39:28] <+TopTieramisu> made for paige and her child, pat
[3:39:31] <gespenstkick> SO it's a Pixar movie
[3:39:37] <+RealThiele> like an adventure time or regular show
[3:39:38] <Neo_Kaiser> A couple of fans said two characters were gay. The creator said they weren't. They got offended.
[3:39:38] <+Ez3z> thats not a real controversy that's a tiny corner of twitter controversy
[3:39:41] <+derpy_platypus> paige pergment confirm
[3:39:42] <LoliKappa> there's controversy about everything on twitter, it doesn't mean anything
[3:39:43] <lotharrio> Or wait, was that Harvey Beaks?
[3:39:49] <allanmiri> Mao Mao was big in the USA a few months ago and everyone was talking about it.
[3:39:50] <heartlesshealer> wasn't that a different series?
[3:40:02] <@SoFarFetched> How is that contreversy if its the fans making up shit in their head LUL
[3:40:10] <%GabeSweetMan> Twitter outrage is very strange place.
[3:40:16] <+Taisuru> That seems dumb and inconsequential
[3:40:18] <+MarkoTolstov> People shipped Mao Mao and Badgerclops because they had great chemistry iirc
[3:40:19] <Captainahab_37> Those dang cartoons >:(
[3:40:19] <linSP> you can kiss your man and not be gay, cmon
[3:40:25] <AtisutoCurry> cmonBruh
[3:40:28] <allanmiri> Mao Mao and the badger guy, people thought they were gay and Adorabat was like they're adopted daughter
[3:40:31] <LifesNeverHumDrum> show looks cute! i'll have to check it out
[3:40:31] <+cvp5127> shipping ruins everything
[3:40:35] <OneThousandTomatoes> LUL
[3:40:36] <@SoFarFetched> Thats like People sending death threats to the Tokyo Ghoul guy cause they didnt Ship Kaneki with his best friend like the fans were doing
[3:40:38] <+RandyFistburgers> LUL
[3:40:42] <LifesNeverHumDrum> wow
[3:40:43] <TurtlesAndTentacles> goodness. screw your shipping
[3:40:44] <+derpy_platypus> tbf square block sometimes fits
