[0:13:14] <%Fuggins4U> she's right, this is Cesar country
[0:13:19] <%spacegloom> ceasars are PEAK
[0:13:20] <+VexicBayn> if you like savory/salty try yourself some Fat-washed rum
[0:13:20] <Melchior_the_Wise> real Clamatos?
[0:13:23] <otakon17> clamato *disappears into his own neck*
[0:13:25] <Melchior_the_Wise> you don't say
[0:13:30] <GarbageQueenEllie> Clamato sounds like an STI
[0:13:32] <%NoHoldsBarredProductions> Yes we are classy folks up here
[0:13:35] <Treasure_Vault> @VexicBayn Which fat? Bacon?
[0:13:39] <otakon17> Lockpicking lawyer is a HOOT
[0:13:41] <HoboFlea> taking a break from playing elden ring to watch you play elden ring. Thanks for helping save my grandpa hands
[0:13:47] <otakon17> have you seen him?
[0:13:50] <AshleyRoboto> oh i love that guy
[0:13:51] <+0ni0n_L0rd> Lockpicking Lawyer is pretty slick
[0:13:51] <+blastyoboots> LockPickingLawyer is addictive
[0:13:52] <%greasypete00> its mcsomething
[0:13:54] <+VexicBayn> @treasure_vault I use bacon fat but beef fat is also viable
[0:13:54] <%greasypete00> ?
[0:13:58] <%rumtumtugnutz> Lockpicking Lawyer is dope
[0:13:59] <Oxybe> lockpicking lawyer is awesome
[0:14:00] <%Ranryu692> don't steal from anyone who doesn't deserve it
[0:14:01] <%Nordguy> the guy who hates masterlocks?
[0:14:16] <+VexicBayn> some people also just use like butter I think
[0:14:24] <nomolomo> do you enjoy a good ol martini?
[0:14:29] <otakon17> don't steal from anyone that can't afford it is the golden rule(note: we here do not endorse stealing, tis only a joke)
[0:14:30] <otakon17> BRIGHT
[0:14:31] <%Fuggins4U> don't say that, your brain is Gouda
[0:14:35] <%Dakuu75> there are a lot of literal flowers you will be picking.
[0:14:36] <GarbageQueenEllie> It's massive, it's intimidating, it's out of control!
[0:14:39] <+ReallyBigRocks> this game is built for meandering
[0:14:44] <slackerunchained> Sometimes I like to put some of my brain on burgers with some shredded bacon. :)
[0:14:46] <its_me_mario216> take it at your leisure madaam
[0:14:47] <josnotforlewd> I just wanna hang out
[0:14:48] <%FingaLights> @Fuggins4U 👏
[0:14:50] <nomolomo> yeeeah the olive is the best part!
[0:14:53] <+0ni0n_L0rd> The game is big and strong just like you, you'll handle it!
[0:14:55] <+RigmaroleHM> Whatever pace is comfortable is the pace you should go
[0:14:57] <Melchior_the_Wise> You love that salty shit
[0:14:59] <+ReallyBigRocks> I personally meandered my way into the ultra fuck zone, it sucked
[0:15:00] <otakon17> Paige has the hollow bones to absorb the liquor quickly
[0:15:00] <%SuckerPunchSyd> Opinions on drinks with bitters?
[0:15:02] <Quilltaz> play the game your way, taking your time with something if you enjoy it is way more entertaining than trying to speedrun everything day one
[0:15:05] <Badgerconda_> Johnnie Walker gang
[0:15:10] <+VexicBayn> you can also fatwash whiskey!
[0:15:10] <nomolomo> love whisky, also love that you can just take it slow with whisky
[0:15:14] <jetpack_rorschasch> If we wanted efficient content, then we wouldn't be here. Just go at your own pace Paige. SeemsGood
[0:15:14] <%thejimjamz> Knob creek whiskey gang here
[0:15:18] <%SuckerPunchSyd> I still need to try whiskey
[0:15:19] <nomolomo> omg thats gorg!
[0:15:19] <Treasure_Vault> Nice tiara
[0:15:19] <otakon17> oooh that's pretty
[0:15:19] <Melchior_the_Wise> oh wow
[0:15:24] <+twdlrr> I like a good Petey Scotch
[0:15:24] <%FingaLights> YO
[0:15:24] <Melchior_the_Wise> that's really fucking nice
[0:15:24] <Oxybe> oooooooh
[0:15:25] <%SharkMissile> cool!!
[0:15:25] <GarbageQueenEllie> pretty
[0:15:26] <Quilltaz> ooo thats so neaaaat
[0:15:29] <%Dakuu75> awwww, it's a little Grace
[0:15:30] <+SPARTAN_KD21> neato
[0:15:31] <+Grayhammatter> neat
[0:15:32] <$Draylle> ooooh noince
[0:15:32] <+notsoy> that is super rad
[0:15:35] <slackerunchained> I always called them 'votive candles'/
[0:15:37] <%spacegloom> shadow laaaaaamp
[0:15:38] <heartlesshealer> It's fine, the game is absolutely massive. Just be sure to level when you can and we'll be happy with whatever pace you go at
[0:15:38] <%ospreyworks> It's actually nice seeing how differently you and Pat play. It's also wild seeing just how good you've gotten since you first started playing Souls games. Actually makes me want to pick Bloodborne back up and maybe this, too!
[0:15:38] <Omenaire_> smelldon ring
[0:15:39] <otakon17> man that would be a lovely night lite kinda deal
[0:15:40] <its_me_mario216> I like that
[0:15:41] <%FingaLights> That's neat

[0:17:05] <+0ni0n_L0rd> Strong thighs
[0:17:08] <AshleyRoboto> i bought a copy on xbox in addition to my PC version and im so glad because my PC version is unusable it just wont let me connect a controller aroboCry
[0:17:09] <TurtlesAndTentacles> YOU WERENT WEARING THAT BEFORE. RABLE AND RAGE
[0:17:10] <penitentpendant> ...did she Pat it up?
[0:17:10] <Danitaras> PC is big and strong so it handles the stutters
[0:17:14] <alroy909> damn those legs
[0:17:16] <%spacegloom> no pants gang
[0:17:16] <Treasure_Vault> Good, get big and/or strong
[0:17:17] <slackerunchained> Just a LITTLE grinding off-screen...
[0:17:18] <+blastyoboots> good!
[0:17:23] <%Fuggins4U> i like grinding in RPGs, it's oddly relaxing
[0:17:25] <otakon17> she Pat it up, there is NO SHAME in grinding for levels offstream
[0:17:26] <+D00msDayDan> this game's enormous don't sweat nothin
[0:17:27] <nomolomo> playing outside of the stream!? enjoying yourself!? NANI!??
[0:17:28] <Treasure_Vault> Off-screen grinding is fine, you still gotta dodge shit
[0:17:28] <GarbageQueenEllie> For Ireland!
[0:17:29] <Melchior_the_Wise> first souls with no pat?
[0:17:30] <%SharkMissile> rabble rabble rabble
[0:17:30] <LorcaNomad> grinding offscreen is probs gonna be very important yea
[0:17:31] <+0ni0n_L0rd> Pantsless percent speedrun
[0:17:35] <heartlesshealer> No, that's totally fine here, there's lots of strong things just roaming around
[0:17:39] <+3d_pbandj> kinda miss the barbarian outfit
[0:17:39] <otakon17> Ooooh you got the Brass Shield FASTER THAN PAT
[0:17:40] <+blastyoboots> gorgeous
[0:17:41] <%Fuggins4U> ooooh
[0:17:49] <+twdlrr> Can't blame you, games too big
[0:17:59] <Blank9> 100% actually, guard negation's on the right
[0:18:00] <%Fuggins4U> Two Vs, for Vvymyn
[0:18:01] <%SharkMissile> Well amd it has 100% block! :y
[0:18:03] <Treasure_Vault> Look at the right side for damage negation. Don't look at shield attack power.
[0:18:06] <%zamatermort> That is attack Paige, you aren't attacking with your shield
[0:18:08] <Treasure_Vault> Unless you love shield bash.
[0:18:08] <%SuckerPunchSyd> Two of them!
[0:18:11] <nomolomo> ggggwaaaay better
[0:18:14] <%legendfather_of_giants> 84 isnt the nu7mber to look at, phys reduction is
[0:18:22] <%Fuggins4U> swords are cool
[0:18:24] <otakon17> Paige, the key aspects of a good shield are teh PHYSICAL block and the GUARD stats(the higher the latter number,the less stamina you lose on block)
[0:18:24] <%Dakuu75> Leveling feels VERY slow paced but, enemy levels feel balanced around it, nicely.
[0:18:24] <+SWFanatic> psaBig Unga
[0:18:27] <Venicilia> @PeachSaliva Someone in pat's chat said the stuttering is due to a conflict with Windows' MIDI compatibility
[0:18:28] <+barrakuta371> 100 physical negation is great Paige
[0:18:31] <TurtlesAndTentacles> Why do you have 3? I didnt think that was possible in these kind of games
[0:18:33] <nomolomo> for a second i thought you had black hair bc of the headgear that youre wearing
[0:18:36] <slackerunchained> Woolie air-comboed a guy with that sword, yesterday.
[0:18:58] <%legendfather_of_giants> @PeachSaliva you're looking at the wrong number on your shield, but that one is better anyways
[0:19:12] <otakon17> oh Paige, care if I give you some info about STR? 30 looks like the softcap for using gear
[0:19:18] <%spacegloom> this game really is gorgeous
[0:19:18] <%legendfather_of_giants> you're looking at shield bash attack
[0:19:24] <%cade_calrayn> yeah the brass shield is great
[0:19:24] <%SharkMissile> moooom the game lady is trying to take me into an underground lair
[0:19:28] <Treasure_Vault> It's still a way better shield.
[0:19:30] <nomolomo> love how youre explaining everything btw! makes it feel very involved
[0:19:30] <+Deekman> Hey Paige. How’re you liking Elden Ring so far?
[0:19:31] <%Fuggins4U> i like how you kind look like Conan the Barbarian's daughter
[0:19:33] <Madtitan23> HUGE
[0:19:39] <+EdHeng> the pen and paper are out!
[0:19:40] <otakon17> yeah there's been a TON of equipment I've seen dropped so far that needs 30 STR to use
[0:19:40] <penitentpendant> Doesn't the "Sword of Thrones" require 40?
[0:19:44] <%AshleyRoboto> AshleyRoboto subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 4 months! hey paige just want you to know i adore you and hope you've been well <3
[0:19:51] <comicalmond> bnovaNotes
[0:19:51] <jetpack_rorschasch> Put it down in your gay agenda Paige. It'll help.
[0:19:53] <%Fuggins4U> i still take physical notes at work sometimes
[0:19:54] <BackflipCharm> Writing things down is the opposite of lame. It's poggers
[0:19:54] <+notsoy> the game doesn't give you a notebook or journal so fuck it, do it yourself
[0:19:57] <$Draylle> thats cool, reminds me of the old school days of gaming
[0:19:57] <%DrBunni> taking notes is never lame
[0:19:58] <otakon17> it might but most of the "heavy" weapons I've seen use 30 STR
[0:20:01] <Treasure_Vault> This game might have needed a journal to take notes
[0:20:04] <$Draylle> sip sip
[0:20:06] <%cade_calrayn> LOL Paige, even Pat is taking notes, I'm doing it too. No shame in it
[0:20:07] <otakon17> it might be an outlander
[0:20:09] <%Ranryu692> damn I hate doing that
[0:20:10] <+comrade_corbeau_> Notes are badass
[0:20:11] <BigFingerRo> OFF TO A GREAT START
[0:20:16] <Madtitan23> Become Giant
[0:20:19] <+abakkus> as someone with severe "just walked through a door" brain at all times, a notepad is the BEST
[0:20:22] <nomolomo> gotta say tho, it feels like you're so much more comfotable during your streams now compaired to when you started with your own setup? Maybe that's just me tho
[0:20:23] <$Draylle> LUL
[0:20:24] <BigFingerRo> LUL

[0:20:42] <%SharkMissile> sip sip
[0:20:43] <otakon17> The Revenge of the Sip
[0:20:46] <%DrBunni> Me and my Grandma would always take notes while playing the video games
[0:20:49] <Oxybe> i have a notebook, index cards and a google doc for notes when playing D&D. a notepad is nothing to be ashamed of.
[0:20:50] <HoboFlea> aaah, paige stream. This is what I live for
[0:20:56] <otakon17> yeah I should be taking notes too
[0:21:05] <%FingaLights> psaBig Damage

[0:31:18] <%cade_calrayn> you just have to find the right ashes
[0:31:21] <%AshleyRoboto> this chest scared the hell out of me LMAO
[0:31:27] <otakon17> yeah you can swapt them out at Graces
[0:31:40] <%Dakuu75> So, ash of war. replaces all the "sharp gem" "heavy Gem" "raw gem" upgrade stuff from other dark souls. (it also gives special moves)
[0:31:47] <nomolomo> gotta say the day/night cycle feels so nice
[0:31:57] <otakon17> did you get the item from the GIANT CARRIAGE yet?
[0:31:58] <%Fuggins4U> you got shoes i think
[0:32:00] <Venicilia> to quote someone in Pat's chat, "device manager > Software devices > Microsoft Device Association Route" Basically the MIDI compatability from Windows messes with the game
[0:32:24] <%holydeviant1> Your Skill is your L2 when two handing.
[0:32:28] <nomolomo> did you get the chests in the big carts?
[0:32:34] <otakon17> honestly you're never there too long till you have at least two peices of gear of the enemies there
[0:32:38] <%KeiganOfAstora> So how are things?
[0:32:50] <+Grayhammatter> heavy loaded
[0:32:54] <%Ra_Ra_Ra_RandomHero> Ra_Ra_Ra_RandomHero subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 3 months! Elden Ring is my first Souls-like game and I'm having a ton of fun but damn is it punishing. Really like sneaking around and backstabbing people tho
[0:32:54] <%EdyBot> EdyBot subscribed at Tier 1. 
[0:32:59] <%FingaLights> @Venicilia Thanks for sharing! gonna have to try this, Hope it helps
[0:32:59] <otakon17> yeah the Godrick gear is a fair improvement compared to most of the starting gear but now you're at FAT ROLLS
[0:33:16] <+Grayhammatter> delicious fat rolls
[0:33:20] <Reanimator83> We fat rolling boys
[0:33:37] <otakon17> I wish you could backstab MORE enemy types
[0:33:38] <%KeiganOfAstora> 2nd
[0:33:47] <otakon17> I've played them all but the Dark Souls remake
[0:33:48] <@CreepyPorpoise> You enjoying Elden Ring, Paige?
[0:33:50] <otakon17> Demons'*
[0:33:52] <%EdyBot> Happy to catch a stream! sipsipHellmo
[0:33:55] <+joeyduderman> No Sexiro: Shadows Cum Twice?
[0:33:56] <$Draylle> It's llke a nice blend of Sekiro and Dark Souls with a pinch of Bloodbourne
[0:34:05] <%KeiganOfAstora> Bloody Mary?
[0:34:11] <+Grayhammatter> it is super fun
[0:34:12] <MaesePC> @PeachSaliva can you fast roll?
[0:34:21] <%cade_calrayn> it's definitely a game built for you to just take your time and explore
[0:34:23] <otakon17> I wish you could use Runes while AT the grace
[0:34:31] <$Draylle> it can get pretty intense
[0:34:34] <@CreepyPorpoise> Sekiro is a lot creepy49Uhhh
[0:34:45] <%VentWilsn> how many bosses has Peach fought?
[0:34:46] <%EdyBot> Is this your first Elden ring stream?
[0:34:47] <SummonerMagno> all luck
[0:34:49] <critiquequartz> It’ll kill your hands
[0:34:50] <otakon17> I say keep pumping STR
[0:34:52] <%MooseIsGoose> more strength
[0:34:56] <%cade_calrayn> @PeachSaliva the character screen actually tells you now if you have Light, Medium or Heavy equip load :)
[0:34:58] <otakon17> you're close to 30
[0:35:16] <otakon17> DEX you can get away with like, 14 it looks like for a fair bit of equipment?
[0:35:17] <$Sphincter_Spelunker> @otakon17 don't remind me
[0:35:21] <$Sphincter_Spelunker> oh, you mean the game
[0:35:33] <+Hexidimentional> i take it pat is tied up somewhere
[0:35:42] <Danitaras> 20 is a nice round number
[0:35:45] <Makr0ss> did you finish demon remake, I'm catching up on yt
[0:35:50] <otakon17> Endurance raises def a TINY bit
[0:35:51] <%VentWilsn> @PeachSaliva is it ok if i send a clip of Jerma choking in Elden Ring?
[0:35:58] <+blastyoboots> Endurance lets you wear HEAVY armor
[0:36:00] <otakon17> it's Stamina and Equip Load in this
[0:36:05] <%holydeviant1> Everything you level will increase defense
[0:36:14] <%VentWilsn> got it
[0:36:20] <otakon17> yeah every stat gained is a bit more defense
[0:36:28] <otakon17> Robustness is status effect bar
[0:36:32] <%greasypete00> robustness is frostbite resistance
[0:36:36] <+Hexidimentional> how is peach enjoying ER so far, now that she's wrenched it from the pastarat
[0:36:38] <Melchior_the_Wise> what is mind vs Intelligence?
[0:36:39] <otakon17> it's your negative status "hp" bar
[0:36:41] <@CreepyPorpoise> Getting big and strong
[0:36:53] <$GeneralSCPatton> Bring up help and explanations to see what all those weird resistances are
[0:36:56] <penitentpendant> The big question is should she dip into Mind for summons/weapon arts
[0:36:59] <Melchior_the_Wise> that is a very fancy shield
[0:37:03] <%KeiganOfAstora> Do you have horse?
[0:37:03] <%cade_calrayn> That way is the main quest, yes
[0:37:10] <%AMajorTom> you were going to check your roll
[0:37:11] <%KeiganOfAstora> Just run past everything LUL
[0:37:17] <otakon17> yeah all negative stats have bars that fill up as you take the attacks, when they reach FULL you're inflicted with a negative status, just like the other Souls game
[0:37:31] <otakon17> BRAVE BRAVE SIR ROBIN OUTTA THERE!
[0:37:31] <%VentWilsn> sent it
[0:37:33] <%zamatermort> You can also sprint on the horse, just so you know
[0:37:42] <%KeiganOfAstora> good luck
[0:37:46] <%MooseIsGoose> i just ran on horse through them
[0:37:50] <otakon17> remember you fat rollin!

[0:40:40] <SummonerMagno> regular enemy
[0:40:45] <slackerunchained> Actually, they are a common enemy
[0:40:46] <otakon17> so you might want to go through the pass while he's dead to the next Grace
[0:40:58] <%zamatermort> From the equip menu
[0:41:00] <otakon17> yeah they just WANDER around
[0:41:00] <critiquequartz> You just beat up a normal dude

[0:51:37] <%zamatermort> The cookbooks are crafting recipes
[0:51:45] <%DrBunni> I thought she was in the opening fmv

[0:54:29] <$Sphincter_Spelunker> @Frostofthecwsw I saw, the bow he held had a hand at the end though
[0:54:40] <%kid_flashionable> aroboDance aroboDance
[0:54:43] <@CreepyPorpoise> What did Pat make you to drink?
[0:54:46] <%cade_calrayn> Oh my.... I just found an entire beach filled with nothing but skeletons.
[0:54:53] <Frostofthecwsw> @sphincter_spelunker oh really?! I never noticed there was a hand
[0:55:02] <%RayReborne> Paige where get shield im jelly
[0:55:12] <tigerfang86> usedFeels
[0:55:12] <%cade_calrayn> it's like something out of one of Paige's fanfictions
[0:55:15] <sunnycyncali> skeleton beach bums dada-de-daaaa-dadada
[0:55:45] <penitentpendant> RNG gives the shield
[0:55:51] <Ziegsy> Is a bloody ceaser a bloody mary with ranch in it?
[0:55:58] <tanarath> Pat put way too much alcohol in it.
[0:56:00] <%SuckerPunchSyd> Give the chrysalis a kissalyid
[0:56:04] <sunnycyncali> ^
[0:56:08] <@CreepyPorpoise> Literally was just at the store maybe an hour ago and thought to myself "maybe I should get some caesar mix"
[0:56:11] <$Sphincter_Spelunker> chug a lug
[0:56:11] <@CreepyPorpoise> creepy49Hmm
[0:56:19] <%zamatermort> L O A D I N G
[0:56:36] <graemecrackers2> ceasers are good
[0:56:40] <%rumtumtugnutz> Bloody Caesar is a bloody mary with Clamato instead of Tomato Juice
[0:56:56] <@CreepyPorpoise> Yeah, its clam + tomato instead of just tomato
[0:57:00] <%VentWilsn> go on Roboto's channel, see "I was raised by Furries?!?!" .... going to watch that later sipsipHellmo
[0:57:02] <@CreepyPorpoise> which sounds pretty horrifying but-
[0:57:20] <Makr0ss> caesar mix isn't a thing here, had to google it
[0:57:23] <graemecrackers2> do you put the sprinkle in the drink instead of on the rim of the glass ?
[0:57:55] <tanarath> It makes everything ok
[0:58:00] <$Sphincter_Spelunker> I don't drink too often but go on
[0:58:35] <%VentWilsn> we dont drink drinks named after religious characters
[0:58:40] <$Sphincter_Spelunker> DansGame fish
[0:58:42] <%VentWilsn> LUL
[0:58:45] <%zamatermort> It makes it gross as hell, got it
[0:58:46] <+logus313> gross
[0:58:52] <%rumtumtugnutz> there's a drink called an immaculate conception that's a bloody mary without the tomato juice.
[0:58:55] <SulfurousAcid> I don't like savory drinks that aren't soup broth
[0:58:55] <@CreepyPorpoise> you can at least get clam juice
[0:58:57] <+typo114> alap5head
[0:58:59] <ghostpalacio> yes
[0:59:05] <+barrakuta371> That doesnt sound appealing, not a fan of fishy drinks
[0:59:15] <%Bloomingzonda> You can also get a Bloody Beaver which uses all dressed chips instead of tamato juice and add a dash of syrup
[0:59:15] <buuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuut> It sounds like graphing
[0:59:24] <RinWR> I had to google Clamato, what in God's name
[0:59:32] <%king_wragles> I mean Clamato juice is made in like Tennessee so I hope we can buy it in the states
[0:59:34] <+comrade_corbeau_> We need someone to invent a Peach Saliva cocktail
[0:59:39] <@CreepyPorpoise> its more salty than it is fishy, I think
[0:59:41] <SulfurousAcid> what weapon does paige have?
[0:59:45] <+VexicBayn> clamato is like KINDA a regional thing in the US I think
[0:59:45] <$Sphincter_Spelunker> Clam+Tomato = Clamato
[0:59:51] <Treasure_Vault> A bloody bull is a bloody mary with beef broth. People are wild.
[0:59:53] <ghostpalacio> clamato is tasty with shrimp and crackers
[0:59:54] <@CreepyPorpoise> Its not like overly fishy creepy49Porpkek
[1:00:00] <%tentavision> Chlamydia?
[1:00:03] <slackerunchained> @PeachSaliva I've heard of the variant, Paige, but I happen to live in Plattsburgh.
[1:00:09] <Pookiedaexzile> You put your weapon away
[1:00:13] <%Bloomingzonda> Some people also like to mix clamato with beer
[1:00:15] <+VexicBayn> it's more fishy like Bonito flake
[1:00:24] <graemecrackers2> salt,pepper 3 drops of tabasco
[1:00:36] <@CreepyPorpoise> octopus...
[1:00:45] <cowboy_plague_doctor> octopus?
[1:00:47] <+VexicBayn> micheladas are okay
[1:00:56] <$Sphincter_Spelunker> coxSoup
[1:01:19] <Makr0ss> micheladasare good for low quality beers big improvement
[1:01:22] <%Bloomingzonda> Dark and Stormies are kind of savory
[1:01:23] <@CreepyPorpoise> Yeah, most cocktails are very sweet
[1:01:30] <%GabeSweetMan> No punch it
[1:01:35] <cowboy_plague_doctor> get the poop
[1:01:40] <graemecrackers2> have you tried sex on the beach ? >.>
[1:01:42] <+VexicBayn> I hate Corona but I'll drink a Corona michelada for sure
[1:01:46] <%SuckerPunchSyd> Sometimes too sweet
[1:01:52] <$Sphincter_Spelunker> crystal lizards are dung beetles now? weird
[1:01:55] <%VentWilsn> its a good thing that lil crab is sipsipSipsipblind
[1:02:06] <Ziegsy> my horse just killed me

[1:05:10] <Rolandknight> she's doing so well!
[1:05:12] <cowboy_plague_doctor> yeah!
[1:05:18] <xxHungryxx> Is Paige going pure Strength?
[1:05:42] <Admiral_PopnFresh> the encumbered run is so goofy
[1:05:46] <QueequegTheater> @xxHungryxx As if there are any other builds for her
[1:05:59] <%Ranryu692> I left for a bit and now Paige is dodge-thumping? Nice
[1:06:02] <graemecrackers2> everybody poops
[1:06:05] <Admiral_PopnFresh> Only Elmo may shit himself

[1:06:20] <@CreepyPorpoise> Paige secretly tobasco dosing Pat to make him poop himself
[1:06:23] <Hydrapissed> I do
[1:06:27] <%Dakuu75> Pat was right, you guys have a lot of Butt related bets
[1:06:32] <QueequegTheater> Hey maybe they do though
[1:06:32] <%zamatermort> So put it in Pat's drink instead Kappa
[1:06:34] <Admiral_PopnFresh> @Hydrapissed LUL
[1:06:38] <Hydrapissed> lol
[1:06:39] <$rdark_ksu> Tapatio on popcorn is pretty great
[1:06:40] <krin_x> tabasco on hash browns is godlike
[1:06:47] <cowboy_plague_doctor> you need like 80 ish more
[1:06:48] <%cade_calrayn> (blind)
[1:06:50] <Admiral_PopnFresh> octoFinea
[1:06:54] <$Sphincter_Spelunker> are those glasses up to date? atpCap
[1:06:56] <QueequegTheater> She's even wearing her glasses and still bling
[1:06:57] <cowboy_plague_doctor> you can do it
[1:06:58] <%DrBunni> math is hard
[1:07:01] <HoboFlea> You realize that you talk about the shit yourself bet, that when you STOP talking about it, we'll know one of you lost
[1:07:03] <xxHungryxx> I prefer Siracha
[1:07:19] <Admiral_PopnFresh> that Zelda jumping attack is working out for ya
[1:07:21] <$Sphincter_Spelunker> don't forget about your hold R2 charge attack
[1:07:23] <%zamatermort> It helps to guard to guardcounter
[1:07:24] <QueequegTheater> First you have to actually block
[1:07:28] <vulpuspictus> If you want a really good Bloody Mary use: Horseradish, celery salt, worcestershire sauce, pepper
[1:07:43] <%SlagChambers> So is there some trick I don't know about with the first boss? I've been stuck here for like 3 hours now...
[1:08:00] <QueequegTheater> @SlagChambers Is it the gold horserider
[1:08:03] <T_Sasquatch> @slagchambers go away and come back another time LUL
[1:08:03] <%Bloomingzonda> My favorite thing about moving back to New Mexico is I can get green chile on my breakfast again
[1:08:07] <graemecrackers2> @vulpuspictus I make ceasers and marys all the time at home
[1:08:10] <Treasure_Vault> @vulpuspictus Exchange horseradish for wasabi and celery salt for soy sauce. Pretty good.
[1:08:10] <Admiral_PopnFresh> OH YES Stamina and Equip Load are on the same attribute again? PRAISE BE
[1:08:14] <%SlagChambers> @SlagChambers No first story one
[1:08:17] <%zamatermort> Hit r2 after the stomp
[1:08:27] <QueequegTheater> @SlagChambers Margit?
[1:08:41] <cowboy_plague_doctor> @Bloomingzonda please eat extra green chiles for those of us who cannot
[1:08:53] <Admiral_PopnFresh> you spin if you do
[1:08:53] <%Bloomingzonda> Will do
[1:08:56] <%pinkslimegoblin> has anyone else noticed a lack of secret walls in this game?
[1:09:04] <Admiral_PopnFresh> beer for me too!
[1:09:07] <GarbageQueenEllie> Toooaaaast
[1:09:08] <$rdark_ksu> roasty toasty
[1:09:15] <QueequegTheater> @pinkslimegoblin >He hasn't found any hidden walls Kappa
[1:09:29] <$Sphincter_Spelunker> oh, did I misread the tutorial? I thought r2 wasn't the weapon art move. I haven't had a chance to play myself
[1:09:31] <%VentWilsn> @pinkslimegoblin has paige ever tried to hit secret walls even?
[1:09:34] <%cade_calrayn> basically, you can change a weapon skill or give it fire, dark, etc.
[1:09:38] <QueequegTheater> This is known
[1:09:40] <SulfurousAcid> toasted swiss cheese mmmmm
[1:09:41] <@CreepyPorpoise> You're doing good Paige, don't worry
[1:09:42] <graemecrackers2> @vulpuspictus a pickle spear with green olives
[1:09:43] <GarbageQueenEllie> What is Determinism?
[1:09:43] <%Bloomingzonda> da ash change how da weapon do
[1:09:52] <xbb1024> hello!
[1:09:57] <cyborgsamuraicowboyfanboy> @peachsaliva Whereabouts are u up to in the game?
[1:10:01] <$rdark_ksu> Paige do brain bad
[1:10:04] <%Sotetsu> A silly goose
[1:10:07] <T_Sasquatch> "as if"
[1:10:08] <TurtlesAndTentacles> isnt that the norm?
[1:10:11] <huskarl_zap> I'm a millennial what is determinism?
[1:10:12] <%cade_calrayn> she's right outside Stormveil Castle
[1:10:13] <Treasure_Vault> She's here!
[1:10:14] <Omenaire_> hello silly lady
[1:10:23] <+WeLucklessJacks> Gurl, same.
[1:10:32] <@MelBrooksKA> I don't know any other way to speak to you Paige spyCappa
[1:10:35] <Treasure_Vault> Ash gives your weapon a different special attack?
[1:10:36] <%Bloomingzonda> right
[1:10:37] <%cade_calrayn> Yup!
[1:10:46] <Treasure_Vault> Scaling?
[1:10:46] <penitentpendant> You can change your 'weapon arts' which also changes the stat scaling for a weapon
[1:10:47] <%greasypete00> thats the scaling
[1:10:48] <%Bloomingzonda> addinity is scaling
[1:10:48] <QueequegTheater> But who was baba
[1:10:49] <%zamatermort> It changes what L2 does
[1:10:49] <$GeneralSCPatton> It swaps the special, and gives you an optional scaling/damage change
[1:10:50] <Treasure_Vault> Strength or balanced
[1:10:58] <vilecrois> it also changes your weapon's scaling, heavy is for str
[1:11:05] <jetpack_rorschasch> No, just screaming is fine.
[1:11:06] <Treasure_Vault> See which one gives you biggest damage
[1:11:08] <cowboy_plague_doctor> you can do shield too
[1:11:11] <huskarl_zap> What damage your weapon scales along side your stats
[1:11:17] <%greasypete00> yes
[1:11:17] <penitentpendant> Yes
[1:11:17] <%cade_calrayn> Yes
[1:11:19] <+Grayhammatter> yes
[1:11:20] <penitentpendant> They're interchangable
[1:11:22] <$Sphincter_Spelunker> elmo says yes
[1:11:26] <QueequegTheater> Yes, for free
[1:11:27] <%Dakuu75> completely interchangable at any time, at the bonfire
[1:11:27] <+blastyoboots> hot-swappable at any grace bonfire
[1:11:29] <GarbageQueenEllie> Determinism mean we no choose nuffin we all spacetime's bitch on the railcar of the universe
[1:11:33] <%Sotetsu> Each one can be equipped to one weapon, and they can be moved around
[1:11:33] <Pookiedaexzile> Its gonna make your STR Stat love your sword more
[1:11:33] <%cade_calrayn> There's also an item that you can buy that duplicates Ashes, too
[1:11:35] <%Bloomingzonda> Peach its like POE gems
[1:11:44] <%Sotetsu> Look at the scaling
[1:11:44] <%Pukenasty> you can unenchant it too so dont worry about messing it up
[1:11:45] <%zamatermort> Scaling
[1:11:49] <penitentpendant> Look at the blue numbers for help
[1:11:51] <+Grayhammatter> heavy is more strength scaling
[1:11:51] <%Dakuu75> the second option, effects scailing
[1:11:53] <$Sphincter_Spelunker> blue = good
[1:11:53] <QueequegTheater> Heavy is strength scaling
[1:11:58] <Treasure_Vault> Heavy scales more with strength, look at the change in damage between the two
[1:12:07] <SGrim> Strength get better, but focus cost for skill go up!
[1:12:12] <penitentpendant> Heavy matches your style
[1:12:16] <+blastyoboots> increased strength scaling but removes dex scaling; you have to add the numbers together when comparing
[1:12:20] <%cade_calrayn> One per *weapon*
[1:12:22] <%Sotetsu> You just blue your weapon
[1:12:31] <%cade_calrayn> You can have as many as you want, just one per weapon
[1:12:32] <GarbageQueenEllie> Fat boooooy

[1:17:36] <%cade_calrayn> did Paige ever equip her summon?
[1:17:41] <critiquequartz> Wag
[1:17:46] <critiquequartz> Wah
[1:18:03] <%Bloomingzonda> A classy alternative to a bloody ceasar is everclear and koolaid
[1:18:06] <sirrice77> You equip summons as an item
[1:18:07] <%cade_calrayn> Top right - Pouch
[1:18:09] <GarbageQueenEllie> So is Elden Ring like a Dark Souls AU or somethin
[1:18:15] <%zamatermort> It is just an item
[1:18:21] <cowboy_plague_doctor> bring out the jellies
[1:18:23] <cyborgsamuraicowboyfanboy> @peachsaliva Poo poo pee pee, Margit has big pee pee
[1:18:25] <critiquequartz> How long until she tries to kill the level up lady?
[1:18:25] <DracaenaLeaf> gasundheit
[1:18:28] <sirrice77> You don't need to equip bell you just need to have it. Summons can only be used in certain areas i think
[1:18:30] <CamazoLive> hello page
[1:18:32] <%cade_calrayn> Pouch
[1:18:33] <%Nordguy> only in certain areas
[1:18:37] <%zamatermort> Yes, you can only use them in some areas
[1:18:38] <CamazoLive> Ii forgot the i
[1:18:39] <%cade_calrayn> Yup
[1:18:48] <%Dakuu75> you also have the "Pouch" slots. (press start, and it's ont he right of the screen"
[1:18:49] <%cade_calrayn> Top right of the Equipment screen
[1:18:53] <BinaryShuffle> you can also equip it on your pouch
[1:19:02] <%zamatermort> hold triangle
[1:19:02] <+blastyoboots> hit Start and go top right for pouch, not equipment
[1:19:03] <GarbageQueenEllie> @critiquequartz Knowing Peach, she would try to talk to her and press the kill button by accident.
[1:19:15] <%cade_calrayn> Top right of the menu, sorry
[1:19:15] <%MooseIsGoose> bell auto uses when you use the summon
[1:19:20] <%Dakuu75> <3
[1:19:30] <+blastyoboots> it's VERY unintuitive, I had a hard time finding it too
[1:19:36] <graemecrackers2> lol
[1:19:37] <%cade_calrayn> So you can put Torrent and your summons on that, that's what I've done
[1:19:42] <GarbageQueenEllie> So you hold the bow w your right hand
[1:19:49] <+blastyoboots> it's not JUST you, the game design basically begs you not to look there
[1:19:50] <%VentWilsn> you couldnt see what?
[1:19:51] <$Sphincter_Spelunker> a lot of people missed that, it's actually pretty common
[1:20:10] <BinaryShuffle> Gamer eye, health is always on the left
[1:20:10] <Frostofthecwsw> I do the same thing. it's a CO.PLETELY new menu system, afterall
[1:20:15] <cowboy_plague_doctor> yeah that could be just that you are looking at the categories
[1:20:19] <%cade_calrayn> I would remove the Return to Grace item from your Pouch, it'll cause problems for you
[1:20:20] <$Sphincter_Spelunker> to me it's cuz it's above the "gestures" which makes my eyes gloss over that section
[1:20:24] <%cade_calrayn> Only in certain areas
[1:20:28] <+blastyoboots> Summons are not allowed in certain areas
[1:20:31] <%zamatermort> only some areas
[1:20:31] <cowboy_plague_doctor> maybe go outside
[1:20:47] <%cade_calrayn> You'll see an icon on the screen, I think it's a silver gate
[1:20:47] <BinaryShuffle> You have to be in a place that allows summons
[1:20:52] <%Nordguy> only in boss areas and some other areas :)
[1:20:53] <%cade_calrayn> ACTIVATE THAT THING
[1:20:56] <%Dakuu75> only useable in specific areas. (You'll see a ghostly tombstone icon, on the left of screen)
[1:20:57] <cowboy_plague_doctor> oh
[1:20:59] <%Bloomingzonda> When you can use them their will be a tombstone on the left side
[1:21:00] <%MooseIsGoose> use that statute
[1:21:00] <%zamatermort> There is a blue symbol onthe left of the screen when you can use them
[1:21:03] <cowboy_plague_doctor> this is a place
[1:21:09] <+blastyoboots> There's a silver gate symbol BIG on the side of the screen whenever you can summon; I think you can summon in this fight but you have to trigger this person first
[1:21:12] <%greasypete00> oh dear
[1:21:13] <%Sotetsu> fmgCAM
[1:21:16] <RinWR> Oh that guy
[1:21:18] <$Sphincter_Spelunker> he said the thing

[1:21:32] <+Grayhammatter> yep 󠀀

[1:21:32] <%Ranryu692> probably
[1:21:33] <%zamatermort> Yes
[1:21:35] <GarbageQueenEllie> "The Main Character, in search of the PEEPEEPOOPOODINGDONG"
[1:21:36] <$Sphincter_Spelunker> nice hops
[1:21:38] <%Nordguy> damn he called you FOUL
[1:21:42] <critiquequartz> This seems like a friends
[1:21:44] <%MooseIsGoose> you need to activate that statue when you get back to that hall so you can use summons
[1:21:50] <+3d_pbandj> you beat the Orphan of Coz! you can do this!
[1:21:52] <+blastyoboots> @cade_calrayn Ohh??????? I didn't know that holy crap
[1:21:57] <+Grayhammatter> Margit the fell
[1:21:58] <SGrim> MARGUSSY
[1:21:59] <@CreepyPorpoise> spacec111Hehe
[1:22:01] <+blastyoboots> oh??--wait now she can summon

[1:22:11] <critiquequartz> Oh no
[1:22:12] <xxHungryxx> He was pretty tough in the network test
[1:22:14] <$Sphincter_Spelunker> ok Margaret
[1:22:17] <%cade_calrayn> it may just be for multiplayer and NPC summons though
[1:22:20] <critiquequartz> She thinks the boss is hot
[1:22:25] <$Mothman742> how crusty u think his margussy is???
[1:22:32] <cowboy_plague_doctor> those wolves are great
[1:22:36] <GarbageQueenEllie> lol his name is Margaret
[1:22:49] <+Grayhammatter> wolves doing work
[1:22:55] <$Sphincter_Spelunker> @Mothman742 atpCarl
[1:23:00] <%Sotetsu> This guy took me around 2 hours to beat.
[1:23:01] <%MooseIsGoose> jellyfish does pretty good on him
[1:23:10] <%zamatermort> It would 100000% be Paige luck if he fell off the side
[1:23:15] <critiquequartz> Paige do a big good
[1:23:25] <cowboy_plague_doctor> he said you get a C+

[1:23:45] <%Puhff> LMAO
[1:23:47] <critiquequartz> NOOO!
[1:23:51] <BinaryShuffle> LUL
[1:23:53] <+blastyoboots> @PeachSaliva after you've hit him a few times when there's a sound and he stumbles to his knees, that's ripostable-- if you slow down out of your combo and press R1 at him from that you'll do the crit animation
[1:23:55] <%Sotetsu> That was a good first try
[1:23:57] <$Sphincter_Spelunker> @Mothman742 watch me atpCarl
[1:23:58] <@CreepyPorpoise> that was a great first go at it I'd say
[1:24:03] <eduwardovich> Properly sauced
[1:24:04] <xxHungryxx> We going for round 2 against Marge?
[1:24:07] <Treasure_Vault> So, most people don't beeline here. You're very powerful and courageous.
[1:24:09] <susukouhai> Hey at least he didnt kill u right
[1:24:10] <critiquequartz> Bloodborne the boss and doge into the attacks
[1:24:13] <$Mothman742> @sphincter_spelunker

[1:24:15] <+blastyoboots> from front
[1:24:17] <%cade_calrayn> From the front too
[1:24:17] <marvel877> What booze is she drinking?
[1:24:26] <jetpack_rorschasch> When they get staggered try running up to them for the crit.
[1:24:31] <+blastyoboots> Riposte is from front once he stumbles/staggers
[1:24:32] <$Mothman742> @sphincter_spelunker fool ur just fueling my kink
[1:24:33] <BinaryShuffle> from front
[1:24:40] <cowboy_plague_doctor> she's drinking clams
[1:24:42] <@CreepyPorpoise> Oh no
[1:24:45] <critiquequartz> I think Paige is at peak power when tipsy
[1:24:46] <%rumtumtugnutz> Tomato Fish Water!
[1:24:48] <marvel877> release the hounds

[1:25:36] <cyborgsamuraicowboyfanboy> @peachsaliva Ho Wow. Second phase on the 1st try! Nice!
[1:25:36] <+blastyoboots> you can riposte from the front or the back alike
[1:25:50] <SGrim> Git gud
[1:25:53] <%Sotetsu> Terrain is the real enemy
[1:25:55] <TurtlesAndTentacles> Too Much roll

[1:27:04] <$Mothman742> imagine being maidenless
[1:27:10] <GarbageQueenEllie> Why is Historia Reiss giving you exposition
[1:27:14] <cyborgsamuraicowboyfanboy> @sphincter_spelunker That definitely don't look anything like guts
[1:27:21] <Melchior_the_Wise> Horse Girls
[1:27:22] <+comrade_corbeau_> If this horse dies I will cry
[1:27:29] <DickieWoodsmall_279> putting a cool accessory on my character and calling myself the Garnished

[1:28:15] <T_Sasquatch> I blinked how many times did she take to beat him
[1:28:18] <Makr0ss> she really said "lets go somewhere more private *wink*"
[1:28:22] <eduwardovich> Don't test it, just to be safe.
[1:28:24] <heartlesshealer> bloodborne feelings and YES no attacks allowed near the friendlies in here

[1:28:55] <LorcaNomad> yeah you got here earlier than pat good job
[1:28:56] <T_Sasquatch> Dude you smashed this
[1:29:04] <+Maleicus> i think its just this spot
[1:29:04] <TurtlesAndTentacles> This game is a "go at your own pace" kinda thing
[1:29:09] <+blastyoboots> I think you have to face Margit at least once to get there? instead of dicking around the map like Pat did
[1:29:12] <eduwardovich> Britches are too smol to cointain your hugeness
[1:29:12] <DickieWoodsmall_279> they had to fashion him a tiny chair to sit at the table so it took longer for the invite
[1:29:16] <$Sphincter_Spelunker> that's like the DS3 guy
[1:29:16] <LorcaNomad> PAT HAD TO RELY ON SPELLS TO BEAT THAT GUY LUL
[1:29:18] <%Ranryu692> Pat explored a lot further south lol

[1:30:52] <silentshrug> @GarbageQueenEllie some people drink just to get out of their own head for a while. As long as its responsible, drinking can be very cathartic in that way

[1:38:31] <+vascillia> @PeachSaliva can you hide your helmet in this or do you just have it unequipped
[1:38:36] <Melchior_the_Wise> maybe all paige needed from a woman was a hug
[1:38:39] <%Sotetsu> It's had to tell, but the mirror in this room also does something.
[1:38:41] <T_Sasquatch> Wait what

[1:38:48] <DickieWoodsmall_279> hug you to death
[1:38:49] <%zamatermort> hit triangle
[1:38:50] <SGrim> SUCCUBUS
[1:38:52] <Treasure_Vault> Also, check her cool mirror
[1:38:55] <%cade_calrayn> BETRAYED BY THE BOOBA
[1:38:57] <$GeneralSCPatton> I think it's a debuff that goes away when you use the poise buff item she gave you
[1:38:59] <Parapattern> I'd let someone take my HP just so they would hold me like that
[1:39:00] <%greasypete00> little red square with down arrow
[1:39:00] <TurtlesAndTentacles> One Guy
[1:39:00] <$Sphincter_Spelunker> check number?
[1:39:11] <RinWR> So she literally sucks your life up and snowball it into a noble huh
[1:39:17] <%greasypete00> its slightly lower
[1:39:26] <+SWFanatic> psa1guy

[1:39:28] <huskarl_zap> that's what that red down is fuck her I was wondering wtf that was
[1:39:28] <%greasypete00> health down
[1:39:31] <%VentWilsn> @Lunarclock bro i see you bro
[1:39:32] <Admiral_PopnFresh> I WONDER
[1:39:35] <+notsoy> is that temporary?
[1:39:38] <Lunarclock> @VentWilsn you get me
[1:39:38] <SGrim> When the buff expires
[1:39:38] <$Sphincter_Spelunker> it's called a refractory period, paige
[1:39:40] <TurtlesAndTentacles> Dont worry about it
[1:39:41] <+comrade_corbeau_> Succ on her
[1:39:41] <DickieWoodsmall_279> kill her
[1:39:42] <Melchior_the_Wise> you have to fuck her
[1:39:46] <SGrim> Temporary
[1:39:49] <$GeneralSCPatton> Article says she debuffs you 5% until you use the poise buff she gave you. You're investing for an item.
[1:39:50] <Rolandknight> use the blessing she gives you
[1:39:50] <%greasypete00> use her item maybe?
[1:39:50] <%pinkslimegoblin> you get it back when you use the item she gives you
[1:39:52] <T_Sasquatch> Un-motorboat her
[1:39:54] <+comrade_corbeau_> Drink her milk
[1:39:59] <Lunarclock> ill fuck her for you stand back
[1:40:02] <Pookiedaexzile> She gave you something for it
[1:40:04] <Badgerconda_> Pat doesn't refract, add it to the wiki
[1:40:07] <%strakillias> Now she has to motorboat you to give power back. /s
[1:40:08] <+blastyoboots> you can use the Blessing to get it back
[1:40:08] <DickieWoodsmall_279> how to fuck when no penos equip?
[1:40:09] <%VentWilsn> @Lunarclock lytTHUMBSUP
[1:40:16] <Hydrapissed> LOL
[1:40:21] <+blastyoboots> it was there
[1:40:26] <+blastyoboots> yeah
[1:40:26] <RinWR> It was rght there
[1:40:28] <Heyestus> unless yiu can un-motorboat that ho you ain't  getting nothing back
[1:40:29] <+Grayhammatter> it's baldachin's blessing
[1:40:29] <+SWFanatic> Try unzipping pants
[1:40:31] <TurtlesAndTentacles> 3rd row weapons
[1:40:32] <%AMajorTom> down two

[1:40:40] <+comrade_corbeau_> yes
[1:40:42] <Melchior_the_Wise> Bald chin?
[1:40:43] <+blastyoboots> it's the big silver orb, it's a consumable you can put on your bar
[1:40:45] <bassoontyphoon> Try rear but hole
[1:40:47] <Melchior_the_Wise> Bald-a-chin
[1:40:47] <+SWFanatic> damn
[1:40:56] <+blademaster247> Just click discard
[1:41:06] <Melchior_the_Wise> Paige you cosplay as cheetarah under normal clothes?
[1:41:07] <Pookiedaexzile> Use on something
[1:41:09] <$GeneralSCPatton> Go ahead. You can get another anytime.
[1:41:10] <+blastyoboots> it's a temporary poise buff, you could wait until you get in a fight
[1:41:13] <xbb1024> use it when you need to
[1:41:15] <Heyestus> use it when you're out and about. it's  a combat buff
[1:41:25] <+blastyoboots> unless you just want the max HP back now
[1:41:31] <%VentWilsn> alright going to fortnite, good luck and ur doing great paige
[1:41:32] <Pookiedaexzile> Use it to kill something
[1:41:37] <DickieWoodsmall_279> now you're hard
[1:41:43] <+blastyoboots> yeah your HP should be back to normal I think
[1:41:49] <+comrade_corbeau_> Can't trust these hoes
[1:41:52] <Melchior_the_Wise> its never pointless to get a hug
[1:41:53] <+SWFanatic> ooo
[1:41:59] <Pookiedaexzile> No that Buff is good
[1:42:00] <+SWFanatic> awesome
[1:42:00] <TurtlesAndTentacles> Try it and see what happens over and over
[1:42:03] <$GeneralSCPatton> The poise could be good for going ham on somebody
[1:42:04] <80sHairMetalFan> nakkiHappyClap
[1:42:11] <Melchior_the_Wise> not quite as muscular
[1:42:12] <tanarath> No, it gives a poise buff & it's also hug
[1:42:14] <+blastyoboots> that 12 second poise buff is REALLY POWERFUL.  You can tank through enemy attacks while whaling on them
[1:42:15] <$Sphincter_Spelunker> you have a square ass
[1:42:17] <+Maleicus> oh good i can make my character lighter
[1:42:18] <DickieWoodsmall_279> holy THIGHS
[1:42:19] <+SWFanatic> chun-li thighs 4 lyfe
[1:42:35] <Melchior_the_Wise> Southern Ohio?
[1:42:41] <Heyestus> So you're  mexican?
[1:42:47] <Frostofthecwsw> Paige, you're from the US?!
[1:42:48] <+Ches_Neckbeard> southern illinois is not the south Paige
[1:42:54] <Parapattern> I would make your face more round and less gaunt
[1:42:58] <Melchior_the_Wise> @heartlesshealer that would be southern southwest
[1:42:59] <$Sphincter_Spelunker> it's the North South
[1:43:05] <%strakillias> Square ass? Is that like Hank Hill ass.
[1:43:05] <+Stormzcales_Lair> BRUH i been walking around with that debuff since i hugged her goddamn
[1:43:09] <+comrade_corbeau_> Paige is from the dark heart of Florida
[1:43:11] <Melchior_the_Wise> @Heyestus that would be southern southwest
[1:43:16] <Heyestus> Kappa
[1:43:23] <+SWFanatic> The applebee's of chili's?
[1:43:24] <%ospreyworks> Been to Arkansas.
[1:43:27] <%LeRouch_the_Rebel> Southern Illinois sounds kinda like Indiana
[1:43:27] <+Ches_Neckbeard> diet south is Midwest
[1:43:31] <+Stormzcales_Lair> i fought like two firld bosses
[1:43:44] <Melchior_the_Wise> So its like diet diet south
[1:43:52] <DickieWoodsmall_279> less meth than alabama but more than carolina
[1:43:52] <bassoontyphoon> Kind of like how Montreal is diet Quebec?
[1:44:04] <TurtlesAndTentacles> Yes
[1:44:05] <Melchior_the_Wise> I feel like Alabama is peak south
[1:44:07] <Heyestus> That's  your choice
[1:44:08] <TurtlesAndTentacles> You can get more
[1:44:22] <goblinpuppy> Is this the "firelink?"
[1:44:26] <Heyestus> not particularly. Pat got like 6 last stream
[1:44:27] <%pinkslimegoblin> somewhat rare
[1:44:28] <TurtlesAndTentacles> Pat is swimming in them lol
[1:44:31] <+Maleicus> you can buy them here
[1:44:33] <Melchior_the_Wise> are they like pharros lockstones?
[1:44:33] <%cade_calrayn> They're like Pharros Lockstones from DS2, there's a ton
[1:44:42] <+MisterAvry> someone sells them that I've seen. not sure if they run out
[1:44:42] <Melchior_the_Wise> okay
[1:44:50] <Melchior_the_Wise> not quite fragrant branches
[1:44:52] <$Sphincter_Spelunker> Jebaited
[1:45:06] <$Sphincter_Spelunker> unlocked a door to another locked door
[1:45:13] <+SWFanatic> sir onion

[1:45:19] <Hydrapissed> onion messages lol
[1:45:24] <Melchior_the_Wise> is there a hollowed state in this game if you die?
[1:45:26] <+ForlornCarton> A toast!
[1:45:42] <%SuckerPunchSyd> Cozy!
[1:45:44] <Melchior_the_Wise> paige, that table was $12,000
[1:45:44] <Parapattern> Eat this onions
[1:45:53] <civilized_worm12> hi streamer HeyGuys

[1:46:20] <civilized_worm12> doing good. pat brought me here
[1:46:27] <$Sphincter_Spelunker> ring wraithe
[1:46:28] <Melchior_the_Wise> Oh shit its the Witch King?

[1:46:44] <+SWFanatic> Pudding?
[1:46:47] <Melchior_the_Wise> got some lord of the rings in my Souls
[1:46:52] <goblinpuppy> that's what murderers say
[1:47:05] <downmagic> i am only good at bad accents.
[1:47:14] <DickieWoodsmall_279> paige loves crooked old men
[1:47:35] <penitentpendant> Too cool to talk to you
[1:47:41] <civilized_worm12> sir edgington
[1:48:00] <goblinpuppy> Is that a skull mask?
[1:48:01] <bassoontyphoon> Peak edge
[1:48:02] <%Bloomingzonda> Pat isn't crooked he just has flavor crystals
[1:48:02] <+SWFanatic> Paige Saliva, Slayer of Tables
[1:48:18] <+blastyoboots> that's metal!
[1:48:18] <nomolomo> so fucking metal!
[1:48:19] <+MisterAvry> this game is fuckin rad
[1:48:23] <downmagic> lol
[1:48:36] <TurtlesAndTentacles> Time to grind
[1:48:46] <downmagic> this is way better than pats stream.
[1:48:58] <nomolomo> this game feels like a lovechild between dark souls, bloodborne and some extra sauce that makes it its own and i love it
[1:49:02] <$Sphincter_Spelunker> kinda true
[1:49:13] <%ReenMan350> this stream lacks orb. 0/10
[1:49:14] <downmagic> but this is way more fun
[1:49:16] <TurtlesAndTentacles> Both streams have their merit
[1:49:17] <Ipsenscastle> mean
[1:49:26] <+MisterAvry> cruelty
[1:49:33] <+Ches_Neckbeard> there's no Zangief either
[1:49:34] <%tentavision> EVIL
[1:49:36] <goblinpuppy> use it
[1:49:37] <+SWFanatic> psaBig psaOrb
[1:49:39] <%tentavision> EVIILLLLL
[1:49:41] <%LeRouch_the_Rebel> Paige's stream is better because she smells better KappaHD
[1:49:58] <Makr0ss> steal this look
[1:49:58] <Melchior_the_Wise> Smell-o-vision
[1:50:07] <marvel877> SHOW GIEF
[1:50:08] <TurtlesAndTentacles> I come here (and Pat's) because 1. Barely any backseating 2. everyone can comment. I feel community in you guy's streams
[1:50:22] <penitentpendant> Let the boy sleep
[1:50:26] <+blastyoboots> @PeachSaliva Other Souls games like DS2 and DS3 had rings that let you fake your appearance just like that; they were a bit harder to find is all
[1:50:31] <nomolomo> i wanna be able to talk to the cool skeleton leaner so bad
[1:50:36] <downmagic> geif need sleep
[1:50:58] <Treasure_Vault> It's pretty cool how DS3's last DLC was all about big, wide open spaces, then they made this.
[1:51:08] <DickieWoodsmall_279> but is it worth the ring slot? only if you're epic
[1:51:11] <%cade_calrayn> @PeachSaliva you may not remember, but when you were in the spider area of DS2, someone invaded you and took the form of a pot and a statue
[1:51:16] <downmagic> just like real life
[1:51:17] <tigerfang86> shes tryna fuck, RESPECTFULLY tho
[1:51:20] <+Dunder_Mifflinz> @TurtlesAndTentacles To be fair, Pat has a hard enough time frontseating Paige. Everyone knows there's no point
[1:51:20] <penitentpendant> Teleport via map
[1:51:23] <downmagic> no leave
[1:51:28] <Makr0ss> another hug for good measure?
[1:51:31] <Treasure_Vault> Teleport via map, or jump over that railing
[1:51:33] <nomolomo> you can just teleport on the map
[1:51:49] <goblinpuppy> I love that you can perch messages in stupid places
[1:51:50] <%zamatermort> Touchpad
[1:51:58] <%Bloomingzonda> Just wait till you get the charms you hang on the horses butt to hide its hole for defense
[1:52:00] <civilized_worm12> FBBlock TakeNRG no hugs
[1:52:08] <DickieWoodsmall_279> roundtable is in alaska
[1:52:14] <bassoontyphoon> Too many hugs and you both get pergeggabt
[1:52:19] <Treasure_Vault> You can become the horse armour dlc?
[1:52:20] <goblinpuppy> I need an art book for this game NOW
[1:52:24] <tigerfang86> horse penetration is FORBIDDEN
[1:52:25] <TurtlesAndTentacles> @Dunder_Mifflinz True, but it's nice that there are no attempts
[1:52:27] <downmagic> next lvl strat
[1:52:33] <nomolomo> didnt they try to sell like cat butthole jewels or something?
[1:52:37] <Parapattern> Clamato Pee
[1:52:40] <civilized_worm12> no streamer TriHard
[1:53:12] <tigerfang86> she is the one called sailor peaaaaaaaaacch
[1:54:00] <+Dunder_Mifflinz> @TurtlesAndTentacles Lol yeah, it's nice not seeing people spam a million different things to do here
[1:54:40] <goblinpuppy> I'm honestly surprised it seems so chill in here, people go nuts for these games
[1:54:53] <herotony04> Omg am i late? Did she start the game already?!
[1:54:55] <goblinpuppy> glad to see it tho
[1:54:59] <goblinpuppy> yes
[1:55:23] <xxHungryxx> Now, time to bring death to those who oppose you @peachsaliva
[1:55:25] <TurtlesAndTentacles> @Dunder_Mifflinz psaBig 100%
[1:55:32] <+MisterAvry> wah yes
[1:55:37] <+TheMeromex> WAAAA
[1:55:40] <%cade_calrayn> I would suggest *not* going into the castle, Paige, it was kicking Pat's ass just today
[1:55:40] <%CopperTucker> wah
[1:55:41] <thechromonaut> wa
[1:55:42] <goblinpuppy> all good
[1:55:52] <herotony04> Sad waah
[1:55:53] <$Sphincter_Spelunker> but Pat smells
[1:56:02] <thechromonaut> with the fellas
[1:56:07] <%cade_calrayn> ah nvm I forgot you haven't beaten Margit cause I just beat him XD
[1:56:18] <+MisterAvry> Margit is a bastard
[1:56:21] <+MisterAvry> fun tho
[1:56:32] <$inkwell1932> hey i gotta head out, but it was nice joining ya! enjoy the game!
[1:56:34] <$GeneralSCPatton> Ha, we both got that bow prompt at the exact same time
[1:56:42] <+MisterAvry> Dingus Khan
[1:56:44] <+Grayhammatter> dingus-uh
[1:57:00] <MyNameIsRasus> margit kicked my fucking ass
[1:57:10] <+Grayhammatter> nice little hat
[1:57:12] <thechromonaut> lovely cap
[1:57:18] <DickieWoodsmall_279> he kicked me in the groin and bonked me on the head
[1:57:19] <Makr0ss> dingus chungus
[1:57:25] <MyNameIsRasus> bullshit 8 hit long hit string
[1:57:29] <penitentpendant> I would recommend if you want to 'grind' to go explore. You get more runes from bosses than mobs.
[1:57:30] <tigerfang86> lol "why is it you always don't have the right"
[1:57:33] <MyNameIsRasus> took me like 4 hours
[1:57:35] <%thbluewarden> the real dingus was the friends we made along the way.
[1:57:36] <tigerfang86> nice message
[1:58:25] <+Grayhammatter> BIG shield
[1:58:30] <+blastyoboots> @PeachSaliva the hug buff is pretty good, for 10-12 seconds you can TANK through a bunch of enemy/boss attacks without being staggered due to your MASSIVE poise, it's pretty worth the 5% to have at least one depending on playstyle
[1:58:33] <DickieWoodsmall_279> turns out the real monsters were the friends we made along the way
[1:58:40] <+Ches_Neckbeard> use big shield for fighting!
[1:58:41] <Treasure_Vault> Stick to old shield
[1:58:45] <Heyestus> Worse in every way that matters
[1:58:46] <penitentpendant> Not that good as a Greatshield
[1:58:49] <+MisterAvry> equip load, you'll be fat rolling
[1:58:53] <tigerfang86> the power of HUGS gives you POISE
[1:58:59] <%Dakuu75> "Heavy Load"
[1:59:03] <penitentpendant> You're already fat rolling
[1:59:03] <%greasypete00> your playstyle is probably suited to that buff
[1:59:42] <goblinpuppy> chonky
[1:59:44] <+Dunder_Mifflinz> Become the bowling ball
[1:59:56] <%Bloomingzonda> Of course hugs give you poise. Zangief is hard to move because Pat and Paige have hugged him so much
[2:00:08] <$Sphincter_Spelunker> they meant sniper going the other way. the ballista
[2:00:15] <DickieWoodsmall_279> can you cosplay as Dwayne "Havel" Johnson in this one I wanna play as a boulder
[2:01:22] <MyNameIsRasus> i'm so happy this game is good
[2:01:43] <penitentpendant> I hope they can patch out the stuttering soon
[2:01:47] <%Bane_Kaikyo> @DickieWoodsmall_279 game is huge and it's literally day two... who knows?
[2:01:50] <MyNameIsRasus> yeah stutter is a bummer
[2:01:58] <$Sphincter_Spelunker> sure
[2:01:59] <penitentpendant> It fits your playstyle
[2:02:01] <goblinpuppy> Has the pc framerate stuff improved from yesterday?
[2:02:12] <femto216> Strong
[2:02:20] <DickieWoodsmall_279> never forget blighttown
[2:02:22] <mrbooone> curious my fps SUCKS when I got outside for the first time in this game. Is this game still indoors?
[2:02:25] <%Bloomingzonda> There are som fixes people have found
[2:02:29] <MarlooRedd> when I see "ruby weapon" I still think of Final Fantasy 7
[2:02:35] <penitentpendant> Funnily, if your computer is 'too good' it gets worse
[2:02:43] <+Dunder_Mifflinz> I'm playing along on PC and yeaaaaah the stuttering is sometimes annoying. But not too bad
[2:02:45] <%cade_calrayn> Apparently it's actually worse with better computers
[2:03:05] <Makr0ss> remember doggos
[2:03:05] <+Dunder_Mifflinz> @cade_calrayn I have a 3090. This is true
[2:03:07] <MyNameIsRasus> i'm playing on ps4. it's better than i thought it would be
[2:03:12] <mrbooone> my fps was fine before I entered the first open world zone
[2:03:18] <penitentpendant> It seems to stem from a 'cap' issue and something to do with windows Midi
[2:03:21] <mrbooone> I refunded immediately lmao
[2:03:28] <goblinpuppy> puppers!
[2:03:28] <%cade_calrayn> they've figured out the issue already, it's something about MIDI, yeah
[2:03:39] <%Bloomingzonda> There is a windows device for legacy hardware that messes with thing, increasing shader cahce size is supposed to help, and apparently Epic Games store messes things up
[2:04:10] <Parapattern> Fuck him UP!
[2:04:13] <MyNameIsRasus> second phase is monkaS
[2:04:24] <+Grayhammatter> halfway there
[2:04:39] <TurtlesAndTentacles> You got to the second phase really well. Remember Backstab and front stab.
[2:04:40] <civilized_worm12> an admirable first attempt
[2:04:43] <Treasure_Vault> Then he goes slow for the mixup
[2:04:43] <penitentpendant> He staggers some swings, yes
[2:04:46] <MyNameIsRasus> he's so fast and he just. keeps. going.
[2:04:50] <DickieWoodsmall_279> well you didn't do LESS damage than your previous attempts
[2:04:52] <Heyestus> He's  certainly Off-beat
[2:04:52] <TurtlesAndTentacles> You did great!
[2:04:56] <goblinpuppy> Dude the glowing effects look so awesome with this lighting
[2:04:59] <Treasure_Vault> He's like a DS2 boss I think you didn't get to
[2:05:06] <bassoontyphoon> Can you only summon wolves once?
[2:05:06] <+epide> hes one of the best bosses they have made in awhile and the jelly is a ranged shooter
[2:05:06] <$Sphincter_Spelunker> try it on the those mooks outside
[2:05:09] <+Forente> poison
[2:05:09] <TurtlesAndTentacles> I image they are slow right?
[2:05:10] <MaesePC> i think you could riposte him at one point, or whatever it's called
[2:05:11] <%Bane_Kaikyo> dont know
[2:05:11] <penitentpendant> Haven't seen anyone ever use them, so no clue
[2:05:11] <Heyestus> jellies have a ranged attack
[2:05:12] <vilecrois> Jellyfish is ranged poison
[2:05:21] <+vehementvadr> jellyfish plural? as in more than one?
[2:05:24] <%Bloomingzonda> The jellyfish make the boss ask you to pee on them after being stung
[2:05:30] <+Dunder_Mifflinz> This fight feels like a tutorial on summons. I had a nightmare with him
[2:05:39] <TurtlesAndTentacles> Practice outside maybe?
[2:05:41] <bassoontyphoon> @bloomingzonda hot
[2:06:16] <TurtlesAndTentacles> It's actualy not super bad lol
[2:06:19] <+Grayhammatter> oh, it poisoned him?
[2:06:26] <penitentpendant> Huh, Jelly's doing good poison damage
[2:06:27] <TurtlesAndTentacles> YEAH
[2:06:30] <DickieWoodsmall_279> ! POISONED !
[2:06:34] <civilized_worm12> hggGolazo hggGolazo hggGolazo hggGolazo
[2:06:39] <goblinpuppy> NICE
[2:06:42] <TurtlesAndTentacles> FUCK YEAH
[2:06:44] <%Bloomingzonda> Yeah the poison damage seems better than the wolves
[2:06:54] <Makr0ss> quite sturdy jelly
[2:06:56] <MyNameIsRasus> YO JELLYFISH GOATED
[2:06:56] <$Sphincter_Spelunker> panic rolling
[2:06:57] <+Grayhammatter> eating his ass for lunch
[2:07:03] <DickieWoodsmall_279> not the panic roll
[2:07:07] <+MillionStabz> This guy is such a wall
[2:07:08] <penitentpendant> It's very tanky
[2:07:16] <MyNameIsRasus> Quirked up jellyfish goated with the sauce
[2:07:16] <bassoontyphoon> Im all here for the jellyfish
[2:07:20] <+SenorCounter> 1000 men , but 1 paige
[2:07:22] <TurtlesAndTentacles> All you gotta do is block and youre great. Damn. Paige is an inspiration
[2:07:30] <%Bloomingzonda> I think the Jelly doesn't trigger agro because it doesn't do a lot of direct damage
[2:07:34] <+MisterAvry> Panickin' Skywalker here
[2:07:36] <downmagic> or str of 1 peach
[2:07:39] <%LeRouch_the_Rebel> Not even PAT!?!?
[2:07:41] <%greasypete00> if you stab him in the front when you get the stagger it does better i think,
[2:08:07] <susukouhai> He may not be Portuguese but that is a Man of War
[2:08:13] <TurtlesAndTentacles> Feels like he went straight for the jelly lol
[2:08:18] <lilferniee> that jelly is like a literal tank lol
[2:08:32] <MyNameIsRasus> that upswing of his got me every time
[2:08:41] <MyNameIsRasus> did not manage to dodge that even once
[2:08:43] <+MisterAvry> jelly gon die
[2:08:45] <+MillionStabz> tactical crouch?
[2:08:56] <penitentpendant> Jelly had a bad run this time
[2:08:57] <+MisterAvry> F jelly
[2:08:58] <MyNameIsRasus> F JELLY
[2:09:00] <lilferniee> not the jelly noooo
[2:09:04] <TurtlesAndTentacles> The crouching is making me laugh lol
[2:09:08] <DickieWoodsmall_279> o7
[2:09:13] <bassoontyphoon> Not the jelly
[2:09:16] <lilferniee> he deflated so slady lol
[2:09:19] <bassoontyphoon> ;_;
[2:09:19] <%cade_calrayn> lol he just bitchslapped you out of the air with his stick
[2:09:21] <TheSaggitari> peach the big and strong
[2:09:24] <lilferniee> sadly
[2:09:28] <MyNameIsRasus> YEAAAAAAAAAAAAAAH
[2:09:28] <$Sphincter_Spelunker> listen, she's crouching for intimidation
[2:09:28] <penitentpendant> Hello gravity
[2:09:29] <+MisterAvry> oooops
[2:09:30] <+Jeshk0> noooooo
[2:09:31] <MaesePC> LUL
[2:09:31] <downmagic> f
[2:09:32] <%Bloomingzonda> That jelly must be named ky because he fucked it
[2:09:33] <Heyestus> would you get a better roll if you took off your boots and gloves?
[2:09:34] <+Grayhammatter> oops
[2:09:35] <TurtlesAndTentacles> And you forgot your runes
[2:09:36] <civilized_worm12> atpRtsd
[2:09:40] <DickieWoodsmall_279> good scream
[2:09:40] <TheSaggitari> pat the wise and crazy
[2:09:44] <%thbluewarden> oopsie doodle
[2:09:56] <civilized_worm12> all part of the plan nyansSure
[2:09:58] <downmagic> tactics
[2:10:00] <MyNameIsRasus> paige is the biggest and strongest crouchlord
[2:10:05] <%Puhff> she's tryna sniff margit's balls
[2:10:10] <lilferniee> pet the jelly
[2:10:19] <Parapattern> I keep thinking I have a text every time I hear that summoning chime
[2:10:29] <bassoontyphoon> Also that’s such a pretty bell jingle
[2:10:36] <+Grayhammatter> go jelly go!
[2:10:47] <MyNameIsRasus> the name margit sounds like a louisiana man trying to call his wife margaret
[2:11:12] <%Bloomingzonda> I really like how much more evironment destructability there is
[2:11:14] <TurtlesAndTentacles> block is better maybe?
[2:11:27] <%Bane_Kaikyo> did the jelly ever actually poison him?
[2:11:30] <KyberNasse> Crouching is a secret battle technique
[2:11:36] <DickieWoodsmall_279> either block or two hand for big number
[2:11:42] <$Sphincter_Spelunker> around phase 2 he was poisoned
[2:11:44] <MyNameIsRasus> @Bloomingzonda it's really cool fighting shit and the arena is just getting wrecked
[2:11:48] <TurtlesAndTentacles> @Bane_Kaikyo The first time it did
[2:11:52] <penitentpendant> @MyNameIsRasus "We'll name it Margaret if it'sn a girl, and Margit if it'sn a boy."
[2:11:59] <+skyshinecrusader> I really do wish margit could pull a taurus demon and accidently jump of the cliff
[2:12:19] <DickieWoodsmall_279> qa mode?
[2:12:20] <lilferniee> he was on the jelly?!
[2:12:25] <TurtlesAndTentacles> TANK
[2:12:26] <%Bane_Kaikyo> stood on Jelly
[2:12:33] <%rumtumtugnutz> Margit found the matrix
[2:12:35] <MyNameIsRasus> @penitentpendant "MARGIT! Them tarnished's in our property again. Imma fetch the mallet"
[2:12:54] <TurtlesAndTentacles> FUCK YEAH
[2:13:04] <penitentpendant> Phase 2
[2:13:14] <+MillionStabz> Summoning the sorcerer right outside the fog gate really helps
[2:13:31] <MyNameIsRasus> that swing is a fuck
[2:13:39] <DickieWoodsmall_279> that slam attack bleeds damage through your shield
[2:13:42] <+notsoy> that second slash is so slow it fucks the timing
[2:13:45] <TurtlesAndTentacles> Youre getting better. Im hyped
[2:13:46] <UberWolfman> Looks like your stuck where I am LUL
[2:13:58] <lilferniee> would it be better to just dash away from the hammer smash than roll?
[2:13:59] <dan_g_v> jumping works well too 9n those wide sweeps
[2:14:01] <%Puhff> If Pat can do it, you sure can!
[2:14:08] <MyNameIsRasus> everyone gets stuck here, it's a fucking wall
[2:14:23] <DickieWoodsmall_279> jelly had such an easy time inflicting status the first time
[2:14:25] <lilferniee> I never even played the game so like I have NO idea LOL
[2:14:25] <TurtlesAndTentacles> @Puhff YEah but pat's method was...interesting lol
[2:14:27] <Pookiedaexzile> Jumping is highly effective in second stage
[2:14:32] <+Dunder_Mifflinz> It's an NPC summon
[2:14:33] <+epide> npc
[2:14:34] <%Bloomingzonda> sure
[2:14:34] <dan_g_v> yeyeye
[2:14:34] <vilecrois> NPC summon I believe
[2:14:40] <%Puhff> LESGOOOOO
[2:14:40] <UberWolfman> Depends on your Pride
[2:14:41] <TurtlesAndTentacles> Up to you? Sure?
[2:14:42] <+Jeshk0> do it!
[2:14:43] <%cade_calrayn> it's 100% up to you
[2:14:43] <DickieWoodsmall_279> do it summon xXLordCumStomperXx
[2:14:45] <%AMajorTom> Sure, try it.
[2:14:46] <MyNameIsRasus> it'll be just as hard with the increased life
[2:14:49] <+MillionStabz> The boss gets more health but the NPC helps
[2:14:51] <TurtlesAndTentacles> I like the hat
[2:14:51] <dan_g_v> anything you decide is good
[2:14:53] <%Puhff> summon
[2:14:54] <%thbluewarden> up to you, couldnt hurt
[2:14:58] <+Dunder_Mifflinz> It helps a bit for a second meat shield
[2:15:00] <HotSauceFiend> how can you tell its an npc and not a fake/ imposter?
[2:15:02] <%Puhff> you'll be the first person i've seen summon someone
[2:15:08] <%cade_calrayn> If you summon the boss, it gets harder, there's no less pride for beating it
[2:15:14] <TurtlesAndTentacles> I mean...isnt a Summon Jelly the same as a summon NPC lol
[2:15:20] <%Puhff> PFFFFFTTTT
[2:15:22] <$Sphincter_Spelunker> I never beat Ornstein and Smough without a summon atpFeelsBeardMan
[2:15:25] <Treasure_Vault> You can also explore elsewhere for goodies that might help
[2:15:40] <%Puhff> @Sphincter_Spelunker I never beat them at all :)
[2:15:44] <MyNameIsRasus> paige you can frontstab him when he's staggered too
[2:15:46] <goblinpuppy> Same sphincter
[2:15:48] <+barrakuta371> Go Jellyfish go!
[2:16:01] <$Sphincter_Spelunker> I got close like twice, but then I ran outta heals
[2:16:06] <%ceremight> Yeah I did this dude with the jellyfish.
[2:16:11] <+barrakuta371> Jellyfish no! Avenge him!
[2:16:15] <UberWolfman> HAMMER OF DAWN zyzxSHOOK
[2:16:23] <HotSauceFiend> why not summon jelyfish at the 2nd phase?
[2:16:24] <+blastyoboots> @PeachSaliva When he's staggered you can stab him from front OR back
[2:16:27] <%Puhff> le greed
[2:16:29] <HotSauceFiend> or is that something you cant control?
[2:16:35] <Heyestus> when you run off it lets him beat on Mr Jell for free. maybe stay a little closer
[2:16:39] <TurtlesAndTentacles> His hammer looks so cool
[2:17:06] <eduwardovich> His tail is made of lobster or something. It's really distracting
[2:17:07] <DickieWoodsmall_279> assuming you don't die in the animation
[2:17:10] <Onionchamp> You probably won’t have a chance to cast it
[2:17:22] <MyNameIsRasus> summoning later is an interesting idea, but good luck finding the window
[2:17:26] <TurtlesAndTentacles> I feel like the jelly is a good distraction is part one. He's always moving in part 2 aint he?
[2:17:45] <MyNameIsRasus> LOOK AT THAT FUCKER WINDING UP
[2:18:16] <TurtlesAndTentacles> I bet if she swung he would have had a follow up attack
[2:18:25] <$Sphincter_Spelunker> does 1 blue flask refill the entire bar? maybe you could summon twice at the cost of 1 heal
[2:18:39] <DickieWoodsmall_279> I think you get only one summon per fight
[2:18:44] <$Sphincter_Spelunker> ah
[2:18:48] <MyNameIsRasus> I like that he has just enough magic damage so that if you have a 100% phys shield you don't get too confortable
[2:19:48] <+barrakuta371> Go Jellyfish go!
[2:20:09] <penitentpendant> The poison has begun!
[2:20:18] <DickieWoodsmall_279> haha lean jellyfsh
[2:20:26] <goblinpuppy> yoooo nice
[2:20:27] <TurtlesAndTentacles> Your plan worked
[2:20:29] <goblinpuppy> aw
[2:20:39] <+comrade_corbeau_> We believe in You! <3
[2:20:44] <TurtlesAndTentacles> HYDRATE
[2:20:49] <HotSauceFiend> so does the jellyfish have a name? like tentacool?
[2:20:51] <Pookiedaexzile> Run when hammer see
[2:20:52] <MyNameIsRasus> i found that when he gets at half health, it's best to just create some distance
[2:21:01] <MyNameIsRasus> to prepare for the phase change swing
[2:21:11] <+MisterAvry> Paige is good at dark souls
[2:21:17] <%thbluewarden> learning the fell tango
[2:21:20] <DickieWoodsmall_279> do you have a sheild that block magic or holy or whatever his glowy weapon shit is?
[2:21:23] <TurtlesAndTentacles> Paige killed Orphan of Kos in like what one try? She's a savant
[2:21:26] <%Bloomingzonda> Yeah you are doing pretty good. People usually come here better equipped
[2:21:28] <goblinpuppy> yup just takes practice
[2:21:36] <MyNameIsRasus> Paige has got his in the bag
[2:21:43] <MyNameIsRasus> she beat ebrietas in under a minute
[2:21:57] <MyNameIsRasus> i did this at level 20ish
[2:22:01] <+Stormzcales_Lair> has she fought anything else yet?
[2:22:22] <penitentpendant> You can teleport and explore elsewhere, you get more runes from fighting bosses than standard mooks (Also you find more items)
[2:22:22] <$Sphincter_Spelunker> she fought Manbeast yesterday
[2:22:24] <DickieWoodsmall_279> why grind when you can go torment someone new
[2:22:27] <TurtlesAndTentacles> She did kill Ebrietas in under a minute shit
[2:22:31] <$Sphincter_Spelunker> and the gate giant today
[2:22:50] <Makr0ss> did you get the mounted dude from the start
[2:22:56] <Zeif00> a few detours wouldn't be a bad idea
[2:23:01] <critiquequartz> Ebrietas also took her 20 tries though
[2:23:01] <+Stormzcales_Lair> my only complaint is how they kinda run you into him without having you explore the area to get strong enough for him.
[2:23:11] <AstorGasser> What sword is that? Greatsword? Claymore? Zwei?
[2:23:14] <%cade_calrayn> that's the first cutscene boss you *can* fight so don't worry
[2:23:32] <DickieWoodsmall_279> @Stormzcales_Lair it's a feature
[2:23:36] <+blastyoboots> (and Heavy is just the infusion)
[2:23:37] <%Puhff> lil silly billy
[2:24:09] <AstorGasser> Oh, neat, infusions affect names like that. Good to know
[2:24:28] <%Puhff> god i wish that were me
[2:25:03] <%Puhff> gaurd counter bish
[2:25:11] <%Puhff> dont forgetti
[2:25:26] <TurtlesAndTentacles> You okay with the fat roll? lol
[2:25:33] <DickieWoodsmall_279> glowy eyes=more runes
[2:25:34] <%Bloomingzonda> Glowing eyes means they are more likely to have stuff
[2:25:34] <penitentpendant> I would honestly recommend not equiping gear that makes you fat roll
[2:25:37] <Zeif00> heheh fat rolling tits
[2:25:49] <%greasypete00> i love when paige gets into the game so hard she pulls out the drawl
[2:25:49] <%Puhff> Glowing eyes means they give more runes
[2:25:53] <+MisterAvry> you could always take off some equipment
[2:25:56] <dan_g_v> fat is good with Unga Bunga tho
[2:26:05] <%Puhff> I think it just occurs randomly in scrub enemies
[2:26:06] <$Sphincter_Spelunker> download more brain RAM
[2:26:08] <silenthillbookofmammaries> nice glasses
[2:26:08] <penitentpendant> Just switch to the old gloves
[2:26:15] <penitentpendant> That you could medium roll with
[2:26:15] <+MisterAvry> not if you don't get hit
[2:26:20] <DickieWoodsmall_279> paige will always gravitate toward unga
[2:26:21] <TurtlesAndTentacles> Just switch the armbands until you get big
[2:26:24] <%Puhff> barely
[2:26:29] <silenthillbookofmammaries> LOL
[2:26:30] <%Puhff> depending on what you take off
[2:26:33] <+Forente> Same
[2:26:38] <Zeif00> dedotated wam
[2:26:43] <penitentpendant> Unga is fun, but it does have a stat requirements
[2:26:44] <silenthillbookofmammaries> before the dark times
[2:26:49] <silenthillbookofmammaries> before the mustard
[2:26:52] <+bardocckk> just beat margin, motherfucker made me sweat my balls off
[2:26:54] <Makr0ss> I used to read books, can you believe that
[2:26:57] <+bardocckk> margin*
[2:27:00] <downmagic> what are you talking bout you still smart
[2:27:00] <penitentpendant> Before... The Mustard Stain
[2:27:10] <DickieWoodsmall_279> h-how de-deditated wam do i need to wun da suhvuhhh
[2:27:10] <%Puhff> you are smart! Albert Einstein would suck ass at Elden Ring
[2:27:15] <silenthillbookofmammaries> How you like the game so far?
[2:27:17] <goblinpuppy> so you can attack but no shielding on the pony?

[2:27:31] <silenthillbookofmammaries> look its Pat's mom

[2:29:21] <MaesePC> protop5Dance too long, didn't hear
[2:29:25] <chimeraxmachina> Oh no is Paige studying for The Big Test? D:
[2:29:27] <%Bloomingzonda> @PeachSaliva I've been watching some old vods because I haven't seen them since they came out and I realized that it seems like you have been doing a lot better lately with the thinking
[2:29:48] <penitentpendant> Pretty much
[2:29:58] <%Puhff> GRAND LIFT
[2:30:00] <dan_g_v> sounds legit
[2:30:01] <Makr0ss> check the map to make a note where she is
[2:30:11] <silenthillbookofmammaries> "you seem less dumb paige"
[2:30:13] <%Puhff> yeah she seems like she's there to direct you after Godrick
[2:30:19] <TheSaggitari> POSTURE CHECK
[2:30:20] <%Puhff> in case you're lost af
[2:30:51] <silenthillbookofmammaries> fuck em up
[2:31:00] <%LotusLatora> it gives weapon arts
[2:31:05] <+MisterAvry> badger badger badger
[2:31:11] <vilecrois> the white ones have arts or upgrade stones
[2:31:14] <%LotusLatora> silver ones are good
[2:31:36] <+reaver93> you nee to kill those ones
[2:31:36] <silenthillbookofmammaries> Cant believe a souls game has a mao
[2:32:00] <%Bloomingzonda> That is an amazing typo
[2:32:04] <%Bane_Kaikyo> a mao?
[2:32:14] <DickieWoodsmall_279> can't believe they put maoists in elden ring
[2:32:26] <DickieWoodsmall_279> bold choice honestly
[2:32:29] <HotSauceFiend> so to chat: are there elements of Sekiro in this, combat or otherwise? so far it looks like a 100% dark souls
[2:32:34] <%Bane_Kaikyo> what is mao?
[2:32:44] <civilized_worm12> Mao cameo in elden ring
[2:32:45] <Makr0ss> sneaking
[2:32:50] <Treasure_Vault> whats the word
[2:32:50] <+reaver93> communism everywhere
[2:32:59] <%Bloomingzonda> @HotSauceFiend you can jump attack to break posture
[2:33:15] <DickieWoodsmall_279> you walk into a crumbled church and there literally just a real life photograph of mao on the wall
[2:33:17] <%Bane_Kaikyo> @civilized_worm12 Zedong?
[2:33:18] <+MisterAvry> the trees are dancing
[2:33:30] <civilized_worm12> @bane_kaikyo the one and only
[2:33:35] <RyuuAoi> Yoooooo! Peach on a horse!
[2:34:32] <silenthillbookofmammaries> Paige seems happy, we need some archers to fix that
[2:34:57] <RyuuAoi> First time seeing any game play what so ever. Looks legit!
[2:35:02] <civilized_worm12> poor dogs atpFeelsBeardMan
[2:35:06] <RyuuAoi> She jumped!
[2:35:12] <silenthillbookofmammaries> pup snuffing

[2:35:36] <HotSauceFiend> so I heard that the Pc version has tons of frame stuttering, but so far it looks ok? or maybe i cant tell from here
[2:36:23] <%MooseIsGoose> little further for grace
[2:36:34] <penitentpendant> @HotSauceFiend It's a bell curve scaling for PC power. Also it's far worse in some areas than others. Late game has full skips.
[2:36:35] <civilized_worm12> so pretty PrideUwu
[2:36:40] <mrbooone> how is your fps in big areas?
[2:36:41] <goblinpuppy> I love how everything looks like a painting

[2:37:59] <silenthillbookofmammaries> Is your pc a beast to run this?
[2:38:04] <butthurtdave> You're doing a great job Paige.   I've been watching my brother try and beat everything with magic all day and he's nowhere near as far as you.

[3:10:43] <twistedj3ster> Do you see Woolie's house in it?
[3:10:45] <@MelBrooksKA> It's not a swamp, it's Miyazaki's addiction
[3:10:45] <Monkeyweed21> maybe its a healing swamp
[3:10:48] <Admiral_PopnFresh> a skull
[3:10:53] <+RedMaskBandit> PokBlaziken
[3:10:54] <DickieWoodsmall_279> there needs to be a swamp for every status effect
[3:10:54] <silenthillbookofmammaries> now with 30% more swamps than other souls titles
[3:10:55] <+ajeanstarks78 > no worse
[3:10:56] <Parapattern> It's technically a marsh
