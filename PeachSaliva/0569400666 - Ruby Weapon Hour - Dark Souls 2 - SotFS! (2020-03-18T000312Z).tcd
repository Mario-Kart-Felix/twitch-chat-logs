[0:21:05] <%SoFarFetched> Cheer200 Hey Paige,so we're trying a method of saving food we made by using a vacuum sealer to freeze things so they can be warmed up for later. Recently had Curry made,so testing with one pack for now to see how well it works during this time. So it's not like we're eating the same thing 3 times a day. Food tends to be made with a lot of servings.

[0:27:36] <CookieDoughFK> a slow death
[0:27:37] <%DXLelouch24> EARTHS ON VACATION
[0:27:38] <$Draylle> the day the earth stood still
[0:27:39] <%GarbageQueenEllie> My Bloomer brain is incapable of entertaining the idea of HellWorld
[0:27:42] <peachy996> A new world order
[0:27:43] <%EyeFarted> NO, PEOPLE ARE JUST BEING STUPID

[0:28:04] <%maskofmichael> So pretend it's Thanksgiving?
[0:28:05] <Kirbachev> @PeachSaliva Something that pisses me off about the panic-buying is that the people hoarding loads of food probably aren't going to be able to actually eat it all. A lot of it's going to end up being wasted.

[0:28:34] <%Niney_Who> @PeachSaliva My friend works Grocery part time. He had a 45 hour week last week. Staying from 4am normally to being kept until 7-10 am
[0:28:36] <peachy996> America's crazy peenor
[0:28:36] <%ShootThatZombie> the beach is crowded over there like, why????
[0:28:37] <mike_wate> Great time to get in the stock market
[0:28:40] <RubberFistFight> Ok dude. Supermarket shelves are empty because panicky dipshits keep going hoard-shopping. It's not impacting the production side, it's impacting the SUPPLY side. There's plenty of food and other stuff, it's just that it takes a finite, non-0 amount of time to get from the depot to the supermarket. That delay adds up.
[0:28:42] <%konekoryugamine> I know people in Florida and I am not happy for them
[0:28:44] <CaptainKarite> So long as most of our government has to deal
[0:28:44] <mattdel92> No california needs to sink...all of it
[0:28:44] <%GarbageQueenEllie> Fuck's sake, Florida. I leave for two decades and THIS is what you do?!?!
[0:28:44] <$wolfofsound> @PeachSaliva florida also had the girl that licked the airplane toilet seat
[0:28:45] <+michingmallecho> Bunch of assholes and spring breakers
[0:28:47] <%TheMattman1313> Clearly going to the beach is how Floridians vote

You'll like to hear this, one of the guys from the Giant Robot Shit Fight from a few years ago is currently doing a livestream talking about what was actually real in that battle. Both robots were unmanned like 80% of the time, and all the falls and collisions were faked with cables and editing. Guy sounds super sad that it ended up like that.

[2:58:48] <derap41> but not Sekiro
[2:58:49] <+blademaster247> Paige, you don't even remember those events
[2:58:49] <trianglehat> does Paige remember?
[2:58:49] <+DazzlingFuhrer> Paige was using an unplugged controller, Pat actually beat those games.
[2:58:49] <+TheDullaMAN> Shoot Rat
[2:58:49] <SausageShogun> not really :)
[2:58:49] <Tatumc123> when you call your boyfriend to fight for you but he gets beat up too
[2:58:50] <JanusII> Nah.
[2:58:50] <abelincoln_catpuncher> 1 handed Greatsword R1 would crush those rats @PeachSaliva
[2:58:51] <%MayorRev> oooooh I member

[2:58:52] <LiquidMathew> also remember all the women she has killed
[2:58:52] <+AbnormalVoid> vineRiker it never happened
[2:58:54] <+patriotrenegade> Bloodborne was definitely a fluke
[2:58:55] <%ShockzNDrawe> I remember when pat beat it while you cried
[2:58:56] <JonEWorldbeater> Never happened
[2:58:56] <%king_wragles> @PeachSaliva Hey, I believe in you. Kinda
[2:58:56] <%Dragon_Batman> And Bloodborne which is harder
[2:58:56] <peachy996> Dark Souls 3 is gonna be a trip
[2:58:57] <el_phthalo> georgSurprise georgSurprise georgSurprise georgSurprise
[2:58:59] <%zamatermort> Yes I do. Her brain was better then.
[2:59:00] <%freelancebabymaker> are we even sure you actually beat them...
[2:59:01] <%Deimos002> Bloodborne confirmed babKappay game
[2:59:01] <%GabeSweetMan> Sekiro would cause her arms to burst into flames.
[2:59:03] <%OwlLightningMage> Paige needs to use her full power to defeat these rats
[2:59:03] <%FunkyWaters> Do sekiro
[2:59:03] <mobiusnightshade> Beat Ebrietas first time. Can't conquer shit-coated rat.
[2:59:04] <%TheFilth> oh god Paige playing Sekiro
[2:59:04] <theshillman> Nioh 2!!!!
[2:59:05] <srkAres> its not tho :)
[2:59:05] <%ZComiX> To be fair, Bloodborne i about being fast and loose. Dark Souls is Slow and Steady
[2:59:05] <%SvenHolgersson> Sekiro is the better game tho
[2:59:07] <$Draylle> she would die
[2:59:07] <+HostilePoundcakes> HostilePoundcakes subscribed with Twitch Prime. 
[2:59:08] <+HelveticaScenario> Sekiro is awful
[2:59:08] <zayasu> you beat bloodborne
[2:59:09] <%FunkyWaters> its easy
[2:59:11] <%WhereIsWill> she beat bloodborne
[2:59:11] <Huntercd> Was that a Chihuahua? You were killed by a tiny dog? @PeachSaliva
[2:59:12] <+TheSaintJohn> the rats the rats we are the rats
[2:59:12] <+Soulsbjorne> its a rythm game
[2:59:14] <+Taisuru> Paige do YOU remember beating Bloodborne? What's the final boss?
[2:59:14] <peachy996> You'll have played DS, DS2, BB and you'll still struggle on DS3
[2:59:14] <+TomDanksEGOT> no
[2:59:16] <%g0atmeal> TBH you could probably handle Sekiro
[2:59:17] <valriot> I mean...it's not a good game
[2:59:17] <%mostundesired> That explains so much.
[2:59:19] <+bread_assassin> TBF. I can't handle Sekiro, either.
[2:59:19] <shiny_prinny> paige vs nioh
[2:59:21] <%JusTTheGuyYouNeed> Sekiro would literally cause the chat to die

[3:52:12] <+Taisuru> YOU DO KNOW PAT
[3:52:13] <derap41> They tried doing a real life mecha fight
[3:52:13] <waterstealer> those mechas
[3:52:14] <%rumtumtugnutz> it was called Megabots
[3:52:14] <InugamiTheHound> america vs japan
[3:52:14] <indig0bird> OOHHHH
[3:52:14] <%SoFarFetched> But Obviously they weren't in there.
[3:52:15] <+Pookiedaexzile> Therewas a fake mecha fight
[3:52:15] <+NWR_James> Pat you talked about it at the time!
[3:52:16] <$GoCoSpace> Japan vs USA big robot battle, it was talked about on the podcast
[3:52:17] <waterstealer> america vs japan
[3:52:17] <DracaenaLeaf> Pat knows
[3:52:18] <EldritchBee> Giant Robot Duel
[3:52:18] <+patriotrenegade> It was that thing Woolie was super hyped for
[3:52:18] <%SoFarFetched> cause shit would be bad.

[3:52:25] <%necrocannibal2> but don't tho
[3:52:26] <%Emperor_Machinus> japan vs US robits
[3:52:27] <$Agami23> there were two mechs made by idiots and they wanted to make them fight and it was shit
[3:52:30] <+Andrizzleton> wuhan?
[3:52:32] <peachy996> Pat doesn't remember past a year
[3:52:38] <%GabeSweetMan> I wanted it to either be SUPER REAL or SUPER FAKE but it went midway on both and sucked.
[3:52:42] <%rumtumtugnutz> it was cool but the fight was garbage
[3:52:43] <%sleepy_coffee> Remember the us vs Japan mech battle?
[3:52:44] <indig0bird> Yeah, a Japanese and American companies built robots to fight but it was super dangerous so they didn't
[3:52:46] <+Pookiedaexzile> Its almost like Mechs are too expensive to break in a fist fight
[3:52:47] <%darcfowler1995> I‚Äôm also getting two weeks paid off the casino that I work at is pretty cool
