[0:35:05] <%MarylandJutsu> @ElkRiverDog 35ish minutes
[0:35:06] <%GabeSweetMan> Most people I've heard from have had mild side effects.
[0:35:20] <+Arek_1> There was the question raised that since Tylenol helps with side effects for the vaccine that it may actually mess with your body accepting the vaccine.
[0:35:28] <%GabeSweetMan> Is it on your lap??
[0:35:28] <skyentombment> my dad had both shots already and didn't even get arm pain

[0:39:14] <%ChrisPlaysThing> Paige;'s glass i the glass of Gluttony
[0:39:18] <$BlackMage66652> Her one glass is one of those glasses the size of a whole bottle
[0:39:23] <+lynlyn_ow> @TigerCatGo lagging bc of ping
[0:39:23] <+DragonTrainerBen> The bottle is made of glass, so I guess that counts Kappa

[0:39:36] <+theenigmaticdude> one glass=beer stein
[0:39:38] <oniwahoo> If you just drink from the bottle, that's technically one glass, right?
[0:39:39] <+lynlyn_ow> np
[0:39:40] <%ChrisPlaysThing> i'm already fairly not sober so no judgement here
[0:39:41] <+Kindan55> Yeah this feels super old school
[0:39:45] <%Treuan> bigger ping is better right

Characters that sound like they're talking through an intercom are my aesthetic. If they're being serious it makes em way spooky but if they're being comedic it makes em 10x funnier.

[0:46:58] <$AzureGale> LUL
[0:46:59] <%SveriSageAdvice> to be fair, its our fault for not catching it sooner and bringing it to your attention lol

[0:52:12] <%king_wragles> I mean, prestiging survivors is just for completions sake
[0:52:14] <BalterEgo> so many people have died seeking gnome Chomsky
[0:52:14] <%arcaderabbit48> Gnomes? Like garden dnomes?
[0:52:16] <+BettyMwwaahh> is the character out of focus or is that the resolution?
[0:52:20] <@SoFarFetched> so you only got 2 minutes to find the garden gnome
[0:52:33] <BalterEgo> yeah, there's a gnome that spawns during end game collapse

[0:53:00] <%sorcererone> @PeachSaliva Hey Paige, gotta head off for the night. Feel free to read my whisper message whenever is convenient. Have a good night!
[0:53:04] <+SteadyDB> yeah but the gold is blood splatter
[0:53:08] <BalterEgo> gnome is just a charm, but he's difficult to get so also bragging rights? hahaha
[0:53:15] <@SoFarFetched> @A_Real_American_Trash_Can You  get a bloody version of the basic skin,but you lose all your items from the bloodweb.
[0:53:18] <%superc37> @a_real_american_trash_can you get a special skin for the specific survivor/killer
[0:53:21] <PlaidisTheNewPlaid> It's the boots isn't it?
[0:53:21] <$BlackMage66652> Can we see Bill at some point?
[0:53:21] <@SoFarFetched> and its one piece,not the ENTIRE thing.
[0:53:26] <%Lunarhawk> Meg was never the same on supernatural after the first actress left, the later ones just sucked
[0:53:29] <%arcaderabbit48> When are they gonna tell us what RE monster is in the game?
[0:53:30] <Zeif00> Have you checked out the outfits from the rift Paige?

[0:54:11] <BalterEgo> yeah @sofarfetched, and I loved him in that too. sad you can't use him as a club like in that one though hahaha
[0:54:11] <+MayorRev> Bill is epicccc
[0:54:27] <@SoFarFetched> Paige was sleeping in the barn with the horses
[0:54:30] <+BettyMwwaahh> you had a childhood?

[0:55:59] <PlaidisTheNewPlaid> Women love to be scared
[0:56:00] <@SoFarFetched> Its the few games where paige is okay making a bunch of mistakes in because everyone else is too
[0:56:14] <$cade_calrayn> OMG Paige my childhood bedroom is the same, they replaced my bed with a rock hard slab of a mattress
[0:56:17] <%brokendarktower> mutually assured destruction, you and ur mattress
[0:56:18] <%Treuan> Fair
[0:56:18] <Kain5707> play FF14 Paige!
[0:56:19] <Parapattern> The Gamification of Cowardice
[0:56:22] <%TheWinged7> try it
[0:56:26] <CyborgAV> Just do it, you nerd.
[0:56:28] <Devbob98> Monster hunter got a lot of mechanics lol
[0:56:29] <%superc37> you would not be able to handle monster hunter paige
[0:56:30] <happy_void> monhun is super fun
[0:56:31] <oniwahoo> MonHun seems intense
[0:56:32] <%TheWinged7> go smack monsters with the biggest sword you canfind
[0:56:33] <+BigDumBeak> you'll like monhun, just play the horn and you bonkl things and heal friends
[0:56:34] <RenniGlo> Monster Hunter is fun as hell. A steep learning curve for sure, but you can do it
[0:56:36] <+Kindan55> What about it makes you hesitant?
[0:56:36] <%Lunarhawk> Monster Hunter Rise is great but yeah it will take a couple hours to "learn" your first monster hunter. It will help having someone like Pat to guide you
[0:56:40] <+barrakuta371> but big sword big number Paige
[0:56:42] <%superc37> you would panic at like a jagras
[0:56:43] <deviljhojho_> woah new mic crikWow

[0:57:04] <RenniGlo> I started with Monster Hunter World. It was tough at first but now i love it. Monster Hunter Rise is so much better imo
[0:57:05] <Devbob98> FF14, you just be pat‚Äôs fianc√© lol
[0:57:09] <RenniGlo> Or at least Im having more fun
[0:57:13] <Psyramics> you're probably closer to the ff14 servers than I am

[0:57:54] <+DragonTrainerBen> I play both survivor and killer, and yeah, DBD has the immersion and the rush that I really lack in other games.
[0:58:00] <+Kindan55> You and Pat could get eternally bonded in FFXIV LUL
[0:58:07] <dan_g_v> do we know when and what the RE collab is about?

[1:04:25] <%Prism_Wing> hatch
[1:04:26] <Theo_Marks> i think hes just giving it to you
[1:04:26] <@SoFarFetched> gen would take too long
[1:04:36] <worldbrand> he would have the patience of a saint to let you do gens
[1:04:37] <BalterEgo> he didn't know it hadn't spawned
[1:04:37] <@SoFarFetched> cause thats ALL 5 gens by yourself
[1:04:38] <KellBeII> do gens and if he grabs you let him carry you
[1:04:42] <BalterEgo> just go find hatch
[1:04:43] <Sain_127> the minds of your killer are an enigma
[1:04:44] <doc_ock_rokc> he is giving you both points
[1:04:46] <%king_wragles> I say follow him
[1:04:51] <Devbob98> He‚Äôs not going let you do it, going get bored
[1:04:56] <+DragonTrainerBen> Love this game, no matter certain imbalances in perks etc. What I hate are the f**kin disconnectors!

[1:05:22] <@SoFarFetched> its weird when people leave for a hillbilly geefThink
[1:05:23] <+trahmander> i thought you need 1 more gen than there are survivors left. So you would need 2 gens?
[1:05:28] <Devbob98> This is how Paige met Pat
[1:05:28] <+lynlyn_ow> that poor killer probably waited 30 mins for a lobby just for 3 leavers Sadge
[1:05:45] <Sain_127> wow he is actually nice

[1:16:46] <+ChaosedStar> ive never actually seen this game. is it fun? i feel like its community tends to feel liike a touch like CODs just horror themed
[1:16:48] <+FingaLights> fuzzy pigs that come in packs of 30
[1:17:10] <+MayorRev> hey paige are the balls in the ass yet? just checking

[1:19:24] <Sain_127> pfft, typical capricorn
[1:19:29] <brachydios777> Is that a Flood!?
[1:19:31] <%OswaldTheDog> ouch
[1:19:42] <%LeRouch_the_Rebel> Two Twins, huh? Kappa
[1:19:49] <%LeRouch_the_Rebel> That's normal
[1:19:51] <+indigo_xoxo> I have never seen the twins :(
[1:19:52] <+Fooguwu> I'm really enjoying this 2011 livestreaming roleplay
[1:19:54] <PartyFavors> I feel like the Twins just really didn't catch on, huh
[1:20:02] <+MayorRev> What's that one killer that can disguise as a survivor? i heard they're sadly not that great
[1:20:20] <@SoFarFetched> @MayorRev Legion,they just look like a survivor. Their ability is mainly stabbing
[1:20:21] <%OswaldTheDog> hey look a friend
[1:20:27] <RenniGlo> Just watching other people play as Blight makes me dizzy. Too much bouncing
[1:20:31] <brachydios777> How's Pyramid Head?
[1:20:38] <Srthunda> he looked so confused
[1:20:40] <PartyFavors> PH is real good
[1:20:47] <+indigo_xoxo> Pat plays a mean PH
[1:20:48] <$AzureGale> AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA
[1:20:53] <Sain_127> wait pyramid head is in this?!
[1:20:55] <weapon000> Take me crab father
[1:20:56] <%Lunarhawk> hes fast
[1:20:58] <%ospreyworks> hahha, my older sister just heard the stream and was like, "wait, is that me?? what are you watching?"
[1:20:59] <Sain_127> holy shit
[1:21:06] <lildaddybree99> apologizing for lag?
[1:21:08] <@SoFarFetched> @Sain_127 yes this is the Silent Hill map, and you can have Cheryl as a survivor
[1:21:14] <+Anime_Flux> oh! I haven't seen the skillchecks on hook before
[1:21:16] <@Jekado> i saw people use to map it to mouse wheel to spam
[1:21:22] <+MayorRev> yeah the spacebar tapping seemed like a pain
[1:21:26] <@SoFarFetched> yeah skillchecks for hooks are part of the new update
[1:21:31] <+Anime_Flux> neato
[1:21:31] <BerryliciousDefinition> He's got that cake
[1:21:41] <brachydios777> What's the next crossover in this game?
[1:21:43] <%OswaldTheDog> PH is thicc
[1:21:43] <Ravioli_Ronin> We love triangle face
[1:21:51] <$QueequegTheater> Another update goes by with no Pig buff or rework Sadge
[1:21:53] <@SoFarFetched> @brachydios777 Resident Evil which the reveal for that will be may 25th
[1:21:54] <VentWilsn> spacebar should be mandatory in ranked DBD
[1:21:55] <PartyFavors> You seem, uh, a little doomed
[1:22:14] <brachydios777> I forgot RE is coming
[1:22:24] <%Lunarhawk> this killer is wreckin them
[1:22:25] <+ChaosedStar> how do you win?
[1:22:31] <$QueequegTheater> @ChaosedStar survive
[1:22:39] <+MayorRev> escape
[1:22:40] <+ChaosedStar> like a timer?
[1:22:40] <brachydios777> Who's betting Mr.X?
[1:22:42] <$BlackMage66652> Have they said what the RE killer is?
[1:22:50] <@SoFarFetched> @ChaosedStar fix all 5 generators and exit through the gate,or escape  through the hatch.
[1:22:50] <$QueequegTheater> not yet
[1:22:51] <@Jekado> survivers are suppose to start up 4 gens
[1:22:56] <@Jekado> then open the door and leave
[1:22:57] <@SoFarFetched> @BlackMage66652 nothing yet,reveal is may 25th
[1:23:00] <$QueequegTheater> @ChaosedStar no timer, three hooks and you're dead
[1:23:00] <%king_wragles> @ChaosedStar As survivor, complete the numbers of generators indicated on the bottom left and then open one of the exit doors
[1:23:03] <+Anime_Flux> oopsie
[1:23:05] <%Prism_Wing> LUL
[1:23:09] <@Jekado> each survivor can get "hooked" 3 times.
[1:23:10] <$AzureGale> F
[1:23:12] <RenniGlo> Uh ohhhhh
[1:23:12] <%king_wragles> You can also escape through a hatch, but that's fairly conditional
[1:23:27] <+ChaosedStar> ahhh okay thanks guys
[1:23:44] <brachydios777> I'm gonna bet Mr.X will be the next killer
[1:23:45] <%king_wragles> As killer, you have to kill all the survivors or just be enough of a menace for the end game screen to say anything OTHER than "Entity Displeased"
[1:24:02] <$BlackMage66652> Is it wrong that out of all the RE Killers it could be, I want it to be Alcina the most?
[1:24:07] <%Prism_Wing> he's peeing
[1:24:19] <VentWilsn> how is it still 4 gens?
[1:24:23] <RenniGlo> bless you
[1:24:26] <weapon000> bob the builder's throwing
[1:24:29] <$QueequegTheater> MENACINGLY
[1:24:32] <PartyFavors> I suspect he's waiting for you two to die
[1:24:33] <%king_wragles> The win states are kinda lucid imo, but for survivor it's basically either making it out yourself or helping the rest of your team escape. Ideally both
[1:24:33] <SGrim> @BlackMage66652 no, you just have taste
[1:24:39] <TurtlesAndTentacles> AFK
[1:24:45] <+MayorRev> WAKE UP OUTTA YOUR SLEEP
[1:24:46] <VentWilsn> gg bois, teammate's waiting for us to die
[1:24:53] <blue8moon> maybe found the hatch and is waiting for everyone else to die?
[1:24:56] <%Lunarhawk> just give in to ~the blight~
[1:25:02] <MyNameIsRasus> MENACINGLY
[1:25:02] <brachydios777> Nemisis would be too overpowered
[1:25:25] <%Prism_Wing> Sometimes you find yourself standing there just being aware of your short and confusing existence.
[1:25:27] <$BlackMage66652> Alcina has Mr. X traits but also has those sweet nail blades
[1:25:29] <@SoFarFetched> @blue8moon hatch isn't available yet,generators need to be done by how many survivors that are still alive plus 1.
[1:25:32] <%king_wragles> I'd say immerse, do gens and just try for BPs
[1:25:38] <VentWilsn> rip that guy
[1:25:48] <+Fooguwu> How goes the 5g install peachy paige?
[1:25:52] <mr_saturday93> where is she streaming from?
[1:25:58] <%king_wragles> Alaska
[1:26:00] <brachydios777> Or it could be a RE 1 tyrant
[1:26:03] <MyNameIsRasus> imagine if the re killer is the nemesis wanabe from jake's campaign in re6
[1:26:09] <BerryliciousDefinition> @mr_saturday93 Some barn she broke in to
[1:26:22] <+ChaosedStar> a Wesker killer would be hella cool
[1:26:23] <+Anime_Flux> yay!
[1:26:30] <%RedPanda25> fan of the stream?
[1:26:33] <mr_saturday93> @berryliciousdefinition must be stalking plague again
[1:26:33] <%OswaldTheDog> i screamed
[1:26:34] <+Anime_Flux> wow, 2 nice killers in a row?
[1:26:35] <%Lunarhawk> he is not playing to win
[1:26:36] <%king_wragles> He got his 2 kills, he can't depip from it
[1:26:39] <$cade_calrayn> Wesker would just teleport around the map
[1:26:40] <weapon000> I love the head nod
[1:26:41] <udurbalanced> Wholesome stream sniping maybe?
[1:26:46] <Zeif00> What a gentleman
[1:26:49] <@SoFarFetched> he's probably confused on the survivors as well.
[1:26:50] <@MelBrooksKA> "I've seen much worse, I've been too... the farm"
[1:26:50] <%OswaldTheDog> What a nice person
[1:26:53] <BurningLlama777> Aww, what a cool guy
[1:26:57] <MyNameIsRasus> @ChaosedStar only if he teleports, as weskers ought to do
[1:27:01] <%king_wragles> @RedPanda25 so ranks have gotten gutted recently. This could be a high experienced killer stuck in low rank and is being kind
[1:27:02] <BerryliciousDefinition> Heh...GENerous
[1:27:04] <VentWilsn> HOORAY FOR HAVING SHIT TEAMMATES
[1:27:04] <brachydios777> Wesker would be hilariously broken
[1:27:11] <$AzureGale> Good guy killer
[1:27:20] <$BlackMage66652> I've never played DbD but I might have to for the RE stuff
[1:27:25] <@SoFarFetched> @king_wragles my climb out of low ranks geefCry I feel bad being in the low ranks when I kill them too fast.
[1:27:37] <%Prism_Wing> The pistons on these generators remind me of THAT room in Silent Hill 2.
[1:27:44] <%g0atmeal> g0atmeal subscribed with Prime. They've subscribed for 17 months! Vaccinations, graduation, getting to meet new people again, things are looking up :)
[1:27:45] <%king_wragles> It's so bad I've taken BBQ off, @SoFarFetched
[1:27:52] <@SoFarFetched> geefNLT
[1:27:53] <+GalacticaPhanto> community rules kinda make the game not fun, like tunnelling is frowned upon?
[1:27:56] <@SoFarFetched> thats pretty bad if you removed BBQ
[1:27:59] <%king_wragles> They just... they just either swarm a hook and tell or or just.... sit there...
[1:28:08] <+MackFighters> he's one bouncy boi
[1:28:09] <mr_saturday93> nope
[1:28:15] <@Jekado> eh tend to bounce around on how i fell about him...
[1:28:18] <@SSaryn> Hard to play but has its own stuff. Pretty cool overall.
[1:28:20] <%arcaderabbit48> His power is super boring for succh a fun design
[1:28:28] <Zeif00> Blight is strong
[1:28:31] <MyNameIsRasus> the bincybouncy boi
[1:28:33] <RenniGlo> Bouncy Boi
[1:28:33] <+MackFighters> The Bouncer LUL
[1:28:34] <duplosion> The "bounce"
[1:28:36] <goatlord_> Are there any goats in this game
[1:28:36] <ergulor> mushroom powers
[1:28:37] <brachydios777> What killer is S tier?
[1:28:37] <@SSaryn> The Pinball Wizard
[1:28:37] <%Prism_Wing> The chemist
[1:28:41] <@SoFarFetched> @GalacticaPhanto its depending on the players,some will respect certain things,others won't.
[1:28:46] <@Jekado> OHHHH
[1:28:48] <mike2hands> RIP?
[1:28:48] <$AzureGale> Blight reminds me of the Batman Beyond villain
[1:28:51] <mike2hands> oh noe
[1:28:52] <Emperor_Machinus> I like bouncy boi, but his power seems inconvinient
[1:28:53] <@SoFarFetched> Some survivors will get really pissed off about the tiniest things geefShrug
[1:28:56] <@SSaryn> Possible RIP bois
[1:28:57] <@SoFarFetched> and oh no paige
[1:28:57] <@Jekado> The real DbD killer bad ping!
[1:28:59] <Coystick> refresh your players
[1:29:03] <%arcaderabbit48> When I saw an alchemist-turned-monster called The Blight, I wasnt expecting a giant pinball
[1:29:06] <+indigo_xoxo> We gud lol
[1:29:07] <%Reaped_Psyche> Stream is fine, just reload after this hiccup.
[1:29:09] <DianaTheAscian> is this frezzing me or Paige?
[1:29:17] <%Prism_Wing> They couldn't call him The Junkie, or the Crackhead.
[1:29:18] <@SoFarFetched> oh refresh guys
[1:29:21] <@Jekado> yee refresh fixed it for me
[1:29:21] <+GalacticaPhanto> @sofarfetched yeah I guess some players just follow them to a T more than others
[1:29:21] <duplosion> Twins are pretty strong, but a little bit of a snooze at times
[1:29:26] <@SSaryn> Refresh did it
[1:29:41] <brachydios777> Good now
[1:29:50] <@SoFarFetched> @GalacticaPhanto yeah its just one of those games where you either got really cool players or just some that are awful.
[1:30:09] <weapon000> I was just thinking I hadn't seen Peach on in a while.  I hope she's ok.
[1:30:30] <%Lunarhawk> "thanks girl" his name is Sausage Boiiiii paige
[1:30:33] <brachydios777> So what killer is S tier, chat?
[1:30:33] <+Fooguwu> Recovered from the 5g?
[1:30:47] <@SoFarFetched> top tends to be either Spirit or Nurse
[1:30:57] <lildaddybree99> ive never played. it seems like a lot of pressure to not let down your team when you are learning
[1:31:00] <+Fooguwu> so like usual huehuehueheueheueheheh
[1:31:03] <%Prism_Wing> prismw1Pchan prismw1Pchan prismw1Pchan
[1:31:08] <mr_saturday93> gross sweat
[1:31:19] <brachydios777> How's Ghost Face?
[1:31:22] <%king_wragles> @lildaddybree99 To be honest, until you get to the very top of the rank list no one cares
[1:31:35] <@SoFarFetched> Yeah in DbD everything is all ranked,there's no "non-rank" mode unless you're playing with friends. But you don't earn bloodpoints when playing with friends in a group.
[1:31:36] <%king_wragles> Even then, the people worth listening to actually don't care as long as you're honest with them
[1:31:52] <$AzureGale> Just messin'
[1:31:59] <@Jekado> yeyeyeye bounce with me bounce with me!
[1:31:59] <nmaten> oic
[1:32:04] <BerryliciousDefinition> What
[1:32:06] <+Anime_Flux> good squid man
[1:32:07] <@SoFarFetched> give him your burrito geefPoint
[1:32:07] <$AzureGale> Good guy killer
[1:32:12] <%Prism_Wing> He's just fuckin' that wall
[1:32:14] <@Jekado> he wants points is why
[1:32:16] <+indigo_xoxo> Go for that sick hatch
[1:32:18] <%arcaderabbit48> Nice guy, boring character
[1:32:21] <%Lunarhawk> "Survived" this girl is gonna bleed out in like 5 minutes
[1:32:25] <duplosion> he just wants the points OpieOP
[1:32:26] <%ClericOfSparda> Well, he needed the points
[1:32:30] <%OswaldTheDog> what good monster design
[1:32:33] <@Jekado> the newest killer is Korean Majima
[1:32:34] <PartyFavors> It's fine the entity will heal her up
[1:32:45] <BurningLlama777> Yaaay!
[1:32:50] <%king_wragles> @SoFarFetched Slight caveat for that (also sorry for the ping Fetched). You can play this as survivor with up to 3 friends and get points. But you can get 4 friends and play a custom game, with one of your 4 friends being the killer
[1:32:51] <@SoFarFetched> SHE TOOK BOB'S MAP D:
[1:32:54] <%arcaderabbit48> So are we getting Lovecraft Man next or the Resident Evil character next?
[1:33:00] <brachydios777> Didn't a Kpop killer drop recently?
[1:33:03] <@Jekado> RE is next
[1:33:03] <@SoFarFetched> Resident Evil DLC next
[1:33:09] <@SoFarFetched> and yeah the Trickster is Kpop Killer
[1:33:14] <%king_wragles> Lovecraft man?
[1:33:14] <RenniGlo> 1hr 30min
[1:33:19] <%king_wragles> 90 minutes
[1:33:26] <@Jekado> Yeah Korean Majima, I heard he moves really show
[1:33:28] <AngryCaterpillar> You can describe him as "bad"
[1:33:30] <%Prism_Wing> A few years now
[1:33:34] <@Jekado> he has throwing knives but you have to hit a lot
[1:33:41] <weapon000> he throws knives right?
[1:33:44] <PartyFavors> He's got... flair? But he kinda sucks in terms of actual gameplay
[1:33:45] <%king_wragles> Try hards call him bad, he's fine. Just not super strong
[1:33:46] <@MelBrooksKA> As in a killer that kills Kpop people or looks like a kpop people
[1:33:47] <%Prism_Wing> He's fun and difficult.
[1:33:48] <BerryliciousDefinition> Majima meets the Joker
[1:33:48] <duplosion> He did get buffed, he's better now than he was
[1:33:49] <@SoFarFetched> Yeah he throws knives
[1:33:54] <+indigo_xoxo> He‚Äôs a looker
[1:34:03] <@SoFarFetched> @MelBrooksKA Killer thats a Kpop singer that would murder his fans.
[1:34:04] <%arcaderabbit48> @MelBrooksKA Both, according to his backstory
[1:34:05] <PartyFavors> He's a literal kpop star that was just also a serial killer
[1:34:08] <weapon000> @MelBrooksKA looks like a Kpop star
[1:34:09] <+indigo_xoxo> Rankroulette
[1:34:13] <duplosion> he can definitely still win
[1:34:16] <brachydios777> Its nice all the horror archetypes are  getting representation
[1:34:19] <lildaddybree99> goodnight. still got my last finals left before college graduation so i gotta go sleep.
[1:34:30] <@SoFarFetched> do you need a buddy paige? geefThink
[1:34:47] <KellBeII> ugh just got bullied by some purples and a rank 1
[1:34:50] <%ClericOfSparda> I've never sat there and watched it
[1:34:53] <PartyFavors> And that hotness is how he got away with things like "mixing the dying screams of his former boy band into his next single"
[1:34:56] <$mield916> hey paige
[1:35:01] <@SoFarFetched> yeah we can later tonight if you wanna or later in the week
[1:35:02] <%arcaderabbit48> @king_wragles I saw a youtube video or two about a bearded man in a suit with a glowing dodecohedron thingy traveling to different timelines/worlds as he researched eldtritch truths. I assumed he was going to be a new killer but ???
[1:35:02] <+indigo_xoxo> I always sit and watch his opening lol
[1:35:14] <@Jekado> HAH Plague internet
[1:35:15] <@SoFarFetched> Plague was earlier
[1:35:16] <@MelBrooksKA> The farm...
[1:35:19] <BerryliciousDefinition> He's not evil, he's hot so he's morally gray
[1:35:22] <%Lunarhawk> plague has internet?
[1:35:32] <@SoFarFetched> Yaeh I'll message you tomorrow
[1:35:33] <$BlackMage66652> Plague spends all his bandwidth on weird furry experiments
[1:35:35] <%king_wragles> @arcaderabbit48 Oh no, he's just the dude who provides the lore to the players
[1:35:37] <@SoFarFetched> and we can figure a day
[1:35:39] <Faustgesicht> Stream ending?
[1:35:44] <@SoFarFetched> I can also try to grab Jenna if she's available.
[1:35:50] <%king_wragles> if Paige CHECK HER ARCHIVES you'll see him
[1:35:54] <@SoFarFetched> But Jenna is also   busy
[1:36:04] <%arcaderabbit48> @king_wragles Really?? I totally thought they were setting up some eldritch tentacle lovecraft man with him. Huh
[1:36:09] <Faustgesicht> Btw you get your free 250k bloodpoints paige?
[1:36:27] <@Jekado> Lies its Elmo of Gief
[1:36:30] <@Jekado> or
[1:36:32] <@MelBrooksKA> Allegedly @Lunarhawk He may also just sacrifice goats for internet connection
[1:36:36] <Faustgesicht> yup
[1:36:57] <brachydios777> Plauge "totally not a furry" of gripes
[1:36:59] <%king_wragles> @arcaderabbit48 I believe his name is, The Observer. He could be a killer I guess? But that'd be pretty weird/unexpected
[1:37:02] <%Lunarhawk> anything over 60f sucks
[1:37:16] <%king_wragles> 65 is fine
[1:37:39] <mr_saturday93> I hate it when killers rage quit just because you got all gens
[1:37:50] <+Fooguwu> I love the heat, it's great for my chronic pain
[1:37:59] <brachydios777> Its been a void since Covid
[1:38:00] <@MelBrooksKA> I'll take low 90's here
[1:38:00] <@Jekado> makes no sense because DC'ers loose all points
[1:38:14] <$AzureGale> John Oliver is currently shooting Last Week Tonight in a white studio he calls a white void
[1:38:19] <+kyh9> I'm assuming you and Pat are going to watch the DBD stream  next week?
[1:38:30] <@MelBrooksKA> Then again, I don't go outside so the weather usually doesn't matter
[1:38:32] <Jetsfantasy> You can just bang it out over the summer Kappa
[1:38:39] <brachydios777> RE 8 is best not spoiled
[1:38:41] <%arcaderabbit48> @king_wragles Yeah, that's another thing. When everyone is The Blight, The Spirit, The Trickster, having a dude called The Observer just had me assume he'd be a killer
[1:38:59] <%Lunarhawk> DS3 EASY to bang out over summer 2021-2022
[1:39:07] <brachydios777> I like the radio filter
[1:39:13] <+Fooguwu> just bang it out
[1:39:18] <%SilverJakler> ayy came back just in time lol
[1:39:35] <+MisterTylerrr> Haldo?? Some damn ol Homestarrunner references
[1:40:07] <@Jekado> I hope the RE survivor is Leon and the RE Killer is Chris.
[1:40:12] <%king_wragles> @arcaderabbit48 super fair, but he doesn't really do anything... just watches LUL
[1:40:24] <@SoFarFetched> yeah dont overexert yourself
[1:40:29] <%ShockzNDrawe> ShockzNDrawe subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 28 months! Hey Paige it's my birthday on Saturday so it would mean a lot to me if you could call SSaryn a smelly loser for me. Also mention that how he sets up all of his servers is really bad.
[1:40:31] <@SoFarFetched> a small stream is fine too geefPlz
[1:40:32] <brachydios777> I hope Alister makes an appearence in hell ofa boss so we can see him again
[1:40:40] <mr_saturday93> Don't kill yourself for our sakes
[1:40:40] <@SSaryn> WHAT THE FUCK
[1:40:45] <VentWilsn> bruh
[1:40:46] <%SilverJakler> @Jekado and every time Chris kills someone he says "Sorry Ethan"

[1:54:55] <SpartanSeventyEight> First and only time I ever used a Mori ingame the survivor ragequit almost instantly, so I didn't get the kill, and the token was wasted. ...felt bad.
[1:54:55] <+RandyFistburgers> Eli pro has landmines

[2:03:20] <%SilverJakler> alright I gotta go to bed, gnight y'all
[2:03:20] <SpartanSeventyEight> Any social terms/acronyms you didn't understand until embarrassingly late? For the longest time I thought S.O was superior officer, not significant other...
[2:03:22] <+indigo_xoxo> I always picture you as tall, must big your big energy
[2:03:26] <%LeRouch_the_Rebel> "I hope my kid isn't normal sized" LUL
[2:03:29] <thebalticguy1> Paige wants to cary the baby in a dog purse lol
[2:03:38] <%ShockzNDrawe> oh yeah shit I never finished that pat toilet pic
[2:03:41] <thebalticguy1> itll always suck
[2:03:42] <RushUnplugged> PREGANTE?!?
[2:03:42] <HotSauceFiend> One of the cousins has the opposite problem, at age 15, the son is a whole foot taller than both his parents.
[2:03:45] <Zeif00> Omg, the GAG of your child towering over the both of you
[2:03:46] <mr_saturday93> Tiny babies
[2:03:46] <RushUnplugged> Gregnat
[2:03:49] <Dakuu75> LOL, she took that in a very practical direction
[2:03:57] <KingKZ> Labor socks regardless
[2:04:07] <%Reaped_Psyche> Premature birth is the way to go to save on painkillers.
[2:04:15] <+Fooguwu> she's saying she doesnt want to blow her ass out
[2:04:20] <+Fooguwu> from the butt baby
[2:04:22] <Ravioli_Ronin> Small babey for the convenience
[2:04:24] <SpartanSeventyEight> Paige: "I'll love you nomatter what." Pat: "If you're taller than me and you start pulling that 'leaning' shit, I'm busting out the hacksaw."
[2:04:36] <+RandyFistburgers> Careful, don't let pat turn them into an immortal toilet
[2:04:41] <Dakuu75> lol
[2:04:48] <%MisterRockett> Oh like my mom.
[2:04:48] <thebalticguy1> BIG BOI
[2:04:52] <VentWilsn> leaning? are u talking about when someone uses u as an armrest?
[2:04:55] <%brokendarktower> its in the cars
[2:04:58] <heartlesshealer> oh fuck it's a Peach stream. Are we at the start, middle, or end?
[2:04:59] <$cade_calrayn> I mean look at Elmo, he's worshiped as a god in that household. Plus Zangief. Any child would be blessed to have y'all as parents.
[2:05:00] <%Reaped_Psyche> Your neck has been through enough.
[2:05:02] <mike2hands> aww so romantic
[2:05:03] <RushUnplugged> your future baby will tower over both of you, it's inevitable
[2:05:03] <HotSauceFiend> Wouldn;t pat be doing a limbo lean to look up at your 6ft 3 son
[2:05:09] <Faustgesicht> Your children and grandchilden continue to shrink
[2:05:10] <thebalticguy1> Pat breaks his leg so he has to be his height, but in a chair
[2:05:14] <@SoFarFetched> geefBlank
[2:05:14] <+ashes141> huge child who grows into tiny ripped adult
[2:05:15] <weapon000> @VentWilsn yes I believe so
[2:05:17] <+RandyFistburgers> Weird
[2:05:23] <%king_wragles> Like just a football player in the corner watching you?
[2:05:25] <brachydios777> Pat would resenr his child forever if they're taller than him
[2:05:29] <Ell1ot> i thought you meant a horse jocky
[2:05:30] <thebalticguy1> Youre such a nerd dad
[2:05:31] <VentWilsn> omg that shit sucks
[2:05:31] <+withguac> Oh god no
[2:05:32] <%Reaped_Psyche> Interested in games, but only NBA 2k and FIFA
[2:05:33] <heartlesshealer> As long as you also super teach them about health and safety. It's important for jocks
[2:05:34] <%king_wragles> OH, you mean like having a kid who turned out to be a jock
[2:05:35] <Explodincatz> never to late for an abortion
[2:05:35] <Dakuu75> that'd be tough
[2:05:36] <SpartanSeventyEight> "Why don't you sit down and play the Resident Evil? You're breaking your mothers heart!" -pat.
[2:05:37] <%AncelDeLambert> this is just the Patton Oswalt bit about his own kid
[2:05:39] <+DazedCookies> LUL
[2:05:41] <HotSauceFiend> If you push video games on your child hard enough maybe that could happen
[2:05:44] <PartyFavors> Construction foreman child
[2:05:48] <VentWilsn> unless i did it, then its fine
[2:05:50] <thebalticguy1> He would say it but not mean it
[2:05:54] <@Jekado> oh how was the road trip btw?
[2:05:54] <Decsevm> i would love to see pat get bullied by his child
[2:05:54] <Dakuu75> Pat would go all in on the bionic legs at that point
[2:05:57] <%AncelDeLambert> "I threw your Blade Runner gun on the roof"
[2:06:05] <%OswaldTheDog> talk about the son surpassing the father
[2:06:10] <RushUnplugged> that Patton bit is so goddamn wholesome
[2:06:10] <VentWilsn> cant wait until ur jock son just picks up Pat just to troll him
[2:06:14] <%SpartanSeventyEight> SpartanSeventyEight subscribed at Tier 1.

[2:07:38] <%TheWinged7> you keep saying your a test tube baby, so you may just be a clone Paige Kappa
[2:07:51] <+MisterAvry> pawing through old junk is pretty fun
[2:07:55] <Dakuu75> SHE KNIOWS?! oh-no.
[2:08:00] <%SpartanSeventyEight> I mean she was literally in the chat when you played the Dating sim.

[2:08:06] <heartlesshealer> good mom
[2:08:07] <+RandyFistburgers> a "joke"
[2:08:10] <Ravioli_Ronin> Yard sales are pog
[2:08:13] <thebalticguy1> PAIGES MOM WAS INTO VAMPIRE BOYS
[2:08:14] <@SoFarFetched> Paige Im pretty sure your idea of a good time is getting super drunk before going into a thrift store geefBlank
[2:08:20] <%JD_Lars> What if your kid was afraid of skeletons and you had to get rid of Skelmo?
[2:08:22] <brachydios777> Didn't Pat get like a panic attack when he saw middle schoolars taller than him?
[2:08:23] <+atteroproxy> I‚Äôm here. What‚Äôs up.
[2:08:32] <@Jekado> Xmas Bills?
[2:08:33] <HotSauceFiend> Wait Bill has a new hat?
[2:08:42] <HotSauceFiend> I thought bill only had the sweater
[2:08:54] <%SpartanSeventyEight> I mean of course she doesn't know if it's a joke or not. Pretty sure alot of us don't know if it's a joke.
[2:09:02] <heartlesshealer> Is that like morning mimosas?
[2:09:06] <%ninjanope_> ninjanope_ subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 23 months!
[2:09:06] <heartlesshealer> Oooooh
[2:09:16] <heartlesshealer> that sounds neat to do with friends

[2:09:18] <%JD_Lars> Vampire weekend?
[2:09:22] <BurningLlama777> Mmm... mimosas
[2:09:23] <BerryliciousDefinition> Nice!
[2:09:26] <brachydios777> Because tired
[2:09:31] <heartlesshealer> I typed before blood donation was part of the story
[2:09:33] <VentWilsn> 2 BILLS
[2:09:42] <BurningLlama777> If you drink a lot before giving blood does that alcohol remain in the blood
[2:09:53] <BurningLlama777> Get a transfusion, get buzzed
[2:10:02] <thebalticguy1> i would assume so
[2:10:02] <HotSauceFiend> Yes to the alcohol question
[2:10:03] <heartlesshealer> it does, so don't
[2:10:07] <%SpartanSeventyEight> Well I mean, given that you have a 'blood alcohol level' you'd assume so.
[2:10:20] <%JD_Lars> Give blood. It helps kids and you get free cookies.
[2:10:21] <thebalticguy1> you need your liver to pass the alcohol
[2:10:22] <BurningLlama777> Noice
[2:10:28] <SeikanTekka> Oh, you gave blood, I misheard you say you got blood :\
[2:10:29] <Profmcstevie> Eat hot pancake and gossip
[2:10:29] <thebalticguy1> sadly i cant give blood
[2:10:33] <Dakuu75> If you get drunk off your as before giving blood. will your blood get someone drunk?
[2:10:33] <+Fooguwu> tfw cant give blood :(
[2:10:36] <+atteroproxy> They‚Äôd tell us not to drink for a certain amount of time before we donated
[2:10:39] <Devbob98> And free blood
[2:10:40] <+BrogorkTheFork> is eating a lot of sugar before giving blood good?
[2:10:45] <%ospreyworks> that sounds like such a cool idea!
[2:10:58] <theshillman> We do!
[2:10:59] <%ospreyworks> I donated blood for the first time last year
[2:11:08] <Ravioli_Ronin> I need to give blood, but I‚Äôm like 95% garunteed to pass out
[2:11:10] <brachydios777> Blood for the blood god! And the kids
[2:11:12] <heartlesshealer> I wish I could donate blood
[2:11:13] <BerryliciousDefinition> I almost fainted the last few times I went : (
[2:11:19] <%lupinnights> When I was in high school I was literally the next person to give blood but I bitched out when I realized I didn‚Äôt have a ride home lol
[2:11:21] <BurningLlama777> I'll stumble into a blood clinic saying "TAEK MY BLAD" and you can't stop me
[2:11:23] <%ospreyworks> I had covid antibodies so I felt a responsibility
[2:11:25] <HotSauceFiend> You cant
[2:11:26] <+indigo_xoxo> I go into shock everytime
[2:11:30] <HotSauceFiend> You need a health card
[2:11:32] <KingKZ> Oh wow. The game is actually letting you play it.
[2:11:37] <thebalticguy1> they might reserve it just to residents
[2:11:40] <Devbob98> I guess they don‚Äôt want freedom blood
[2:11:42] <+sandrews> needles are scary. should donate but anxiety goes through the roof around needles
[2:11:48] <Profmcstevie> Wait a minute....there's no leaves in this blood! FALSE CITIZEN!
[2:11:50] <+BrogorkTheFork> I know they give a sugar cookie after but I wonder how extra sugar before giving blood effects it.
[2:11:56] <%ospreyworks> plus, they were screening donations so I got to check each time
[2:12:00] <Decsevm> ew gross i wouldn't want any of your american blood
[2:12:09] <%ospreyworks> had antibodies for at least 6 months after
[2:12:10] <%ShockzNDrawe> i jab myself with needles every daaaaaaaaay
[2:12:22] <HotSauceFiend> Yeah, Needles are pain, I give blood every 2 months and I still cant stand looking at the needle
[2:12:22] <%ShockzNDrawe> i no longer feel anything
[2:12:28] <HotSauceFiend> Just ask the nurse to cover it
[2:12:33] <%AncelDeLambert> Just put the little dot on your license that says you're a donor, plz thank you
[2:12:37] <Devbob98> The jukes
[2:12:38] <Emperor_Machinus> Donate someone else's blood
[2:12:41] <KingKZ> You can always blame the lag
[2:12:42] <PartyFavors> Legion looking fancy
[2:12:54] <thebalticguy1> but youre second
[2:12:58] <BurningLlama777> Somebody broke a glowstick on the killer.
[2:12:58] <theshillman> who is this cum-covered villain?
[2:12:59] <Devbob98> Look she‚Äôs donated blood to the hook
[2:13:05] <+coward_man> I wake up and and paige is live! today is a good day
[2:13:07] <+sandrews> getting the needle is fine it's  just seeing it and the build up to it
[2:13:10] <%lupinnights> An Australian man gave his blood for many years, saving the lives of a lot of babies, practically saving the world with his blood
[2:13:12] <Decsevm> my veins are tiny so it is the biggest pain to donate blood, so i don't try to do it often
[2:13:12] <VentWilsn> THE MIXUP
[2:13:14] <albret__einstrong> Not allowed to donate blood, have too much gay sex
[2:13:20] <heartlesshealer> If I'm sitting down when getting a needle, I try not to look and also let my arm go fully limp when allowed. If that helps any of you
[2:13:28] <@SoFarFetched> paige you might shrivel if you donate
[2:13:34] <Devbob98> Moribus wants that plasma
[2:13:37] <HotSauceFiend> You should totally donate plasma if you are able to
[2:13:39] <%ospreyworks> Plasma is ROUGH
[2:13:44] <GamesNoir> The guages they use for Plasma are HUGE
[2:13:49] <%ospreyworks> you need to have very prominent veins
[2:13:52] <KingKZ> It can hurt.
[2:13:53] <HotSauceFiend> If i didnt have to drrive to Toronto to Give plasma I totally would
[2:13:53] <BerryliciousDefinition> Doesn't it take like 2 hrs or something?
[2:13:57] <RushUnplugged> "they want my PLASMA for FREE?!? like COMMIES?!?"
[2:14:01] <Faustgesicht> Place near me will pay for Plasma
[2:14:01] <%AncelDeLambert> yeah, you're there for like HOURS
[2:14:01] <+AgniBrandt> Plasma uses the big needles
[2:14:04] <GamesNoir> so when they stick it into your vein you're really gonna feel it
[2:14:04] <albret__einstrong> I 'm not allowed to donate blood, too gay.
[2:14:05] <%ospreyworks> they turned me down because I didn't have big vein energy
[2:14:07] <+indigo_xoxo> Don‚Äôt the separate the plasma and put back the blood? Or am I crazy lol
[2:14:07] <+mikesapartment> I donated bone marrow once. It was the worst pain I've ever felt
[2:14:08] <%AncelDeLambert> yeah, but it's hours with a HUGE needle in you
[2:14:13] <$AzureGale> Donate plasma so Doomguy can rip and tear
[2:14:13] <heartlesshealer> @albret__einstrong same
[2:14:15] <brachydios777> BIG SUCK
[2:14:16] <+AgniBrandt> It takes about an hour
[2:14:18] <weapon000> I used to donate plasma when I was younger.  it was fine.
[2:14:24] <+coward_man> losing plasma leaves you very drained, though I only say that as someone who's lost plasma to tattoos
[2:14:24] <HotSauceFiend> In America you mean?
[2:14:26] <+ArkhamBenji> I donated plasma in about 45 minutes
[2:14:27] <+AgniBrandt> It can be /really/ exhausting
[2:14:28] <Ravioli_Ronin> Just do it for fun one weekend to find out woolieFABRICATION
[2:14:32] <%ospreyworks> if they aren't popped enough, they could make a big mess when the blood goes back in
[2:14:35] <Emperor_Machinus> I got an old plasma Tv. Is that where all the donations went to?
[2:14:36] <$Vilecrow> i donate plasma when i can, it really not that bad,. yeah the gauge is a bit bigger but barely noticeable.
[2:14:41] <Faustgesicht> I'll take my $100 twice a week
[2:14:47] <Devbob98> Sounds like a Good Friday night to me
[2:14:47] <+AgniBrandt> They did give me a hematoma with a bad poke once
[2:14:49] <$Vilecrow> the process just takes a bit longer
[2:14:51] <+MisterAvry> they're literally taking your life essence. why not get paid?
[2:14:52] <%Reaped_Psyche> Plasma donation paid my bills for a while.  Though if you do it often enough you start to look like a junkie.
[2:14:52] <+AgniBrandt> Looked like I'd been in a fight
[2:15:02] <HotSauceFiend> Wait how much do the private blood clinics pay you for your blood and plasma?
[2:15:05] <KingKZ> You're arm can be so fucked afterwards
[2:15:06] <Jetsfantasy> They'd pay you for blood too if blood transmitted diseases didn't exist. That's the main reason why it's voluntary
[2:15:12] <%lupinnights> Hey Paige have you been considering trying out Final Fantasy 14?
[2:15:20] <%SpartanSeventyEight> If plasma TV's worked on human plasma, would that technically be blood magic?
[2:15:23] <+wolfofsound> plasma check to the bank Kappa
[2:15:27] <Devbob98> Paige might lose her arm now lol
[2:15:34] <+AgniBrandt> I did it for a few months and I have some minor scarring where they poked
[2:15:50] <+mikesapartment> Is that Bill from the popular video game series Left 4 Dead?
[2:15:59] <theredfox930000> paige is the greatest gamer
[2:16:01] <%ospreyworks> I had originally planned to donate covid antibody positive plasma, but they talked me out of it, so I was like, "can I still give blood?" and they were like hells yes
[2:16:07] <heartlesshealer> yes, there are two of those Bills in this round
[2:16:09] <brachydios777> yes
[2:16:38] <%barkon345> barkon345 subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 18 months!
[2:16:42] <NickiNightly> Hello haven‚Äôt been to a stream live in a while!
[2:16:49] <%LeRouch_the_Rebel> Paige, whatever that voice was, do it more please
[2:16:55] <Emperor_Machinus> @heartlesshealer Is one of those Bills a science guy?
[2:17:02] <%ClericOfSparda> A Mike Myers just demolished my whole team
[2:17:03] <%ospreyworks> I should schedule an appointment to donate again...
[2:17:06] <$AzureGale> I think this match is in the books
[2:17:15] <heartlesshealer> @Emperor_Machinus Depends on if they work on a generator
[2:17:27] <brachydios777> It be great if Valve could count to 3
