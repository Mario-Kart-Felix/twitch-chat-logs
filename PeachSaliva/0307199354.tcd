[1:02:24] <SatansDick1> paige has bad taste
[1:02:24] <outis94> 3 is pretty bad
[1:02:25] <TikanZK> three is a PERFECTLY FINE game
[1:02:25] <XdaXcaptainX> fuck II
[1:02:26] <element_of_loyalty> LEAVE PINKIE ALONE
[1:02:26] <%DavidSanChan> I played blitzball for 20 hours, I think I had brain damage
[1:02:27] <$samuraifriend> minwu is the only good thing about 2
[1:02:28] <XyraFhoan> DS remake of 3 is fine
[1:02:28] <AncelDeLambert> the COMBAT is amazing in ten
[1:02:28] <VanLynx> 3 is fun
[1:02:30] <wsintai> @PinkieTheEerie So that means your 57, by my math
[1:02:30] <+RafflesiaA> @theangryguyofde I'll stand by you bro
[1:02:30] <+ThatRandomGuy661> 3's remake was fun
[1:02:30] <+Pat_Squared> 8 may be bad, but there are bits that are good
[1:02:31] <Anonymasque> 2 looks pretty rough
[1:02:31] <fillmydarksoulwithlight> WTF 2 HAS ROSEBOIS
[1:02:32] <+PipIV> oh booooy
[1:02:32] <roboguy2k> Are we forgetting XV
[1:02:33] <XyraFhoan> the original 3 is a bit bad
[1:02:34] <mercado94> 3 is not that great
[1:02:34] <FourthAve> 8 is best
[1:02:34] <Endlesslyforgetful> i need to see a 2 playthrou
[1:02:35] <%genowyn> Top three are 9, 6, 10
[1:02:36] <Cryomancer_Maurice> 8 is the best.
[1:02:36] <+dahaxguy> @peachsaliva Yep. 2 and 3 are poor, tho the remake of 3 on DS is solid.
[1:02:37] <$konekoryugamine> I have GOT to play DmC 2 to get the idea why everyone says it sucks
[1:02:37] <%I4gotmyname89> 8 is the best
[1:02:37] <+ThatGuyfromMars> 2 has firion right? he's a fucking moron
[1:02:40] <mistermastergreg> 3 is fun Pat
[1:02:41] <Tuskor13> 3 was the first I played. 3 has a good job system but it's slow as death and the endgame is obscene
[1:02:41] <+JenovasPuppet> 8 is a flawed gem, like 13.
[1:02:41] <grayjammer> Putt Putt is the FFX of golf
[1:02:42] <%AbnormalVoid> 8 sucks ass, and the story is hot trash
[1:02:45] <Skion> WHAT
[1:02:45] <XdaXcaptainX> 8 9 and 10 are overrated by babbos

[1:02:53] <+Vostroyan1> she hates triple triad?!
[1:02:54] <%AbnormalVoid> they're wrong
[1:02:55] <+OmegaWeltall> i love Triple Triad but FUCK ff8
[1:02:57] <omenesia> Top three are FF6, FF5 and FF6 Kappa
[1:02:57] <$googleygareth> You don't talk SHIT about TRIPLE TRIAD
[1:02:57] <mercado94> I LOVE TRIPLE TRIAD
[1:02:57] <Rezroc> FF14 was so good they had to kill it and bring it back to life Kappa
[1:02:59] <$konekoryugamine> JUST to prove that I can make it through the game and LIKE IT
[1:03:01] <mistermastergreg> 8 can go eat an ass
[1:03:01] <Cryomancer_Maurice> Yeah, I also hate triple triad.
[1:03:01] <+TsunamiPoro> doesn't clemps love 8?
[1:03:02] <shadowgilgamesh> 8 is worse than 2
[1:03:04] <+PipIV> wifey dead
[1:03:05] <mistymntns> What argument did I walk into?
[1:03:07] <$GohanEgret> the triple triad LP is best LP
[1:03:07] <+Pat_Squared> its the junction system
[1:03:08] <LGWPhanto> The Draw mechanic sucks cause you have an magic inventory limit
[1:03:08] <AncelDeLambert> CARD GAMES FUCKING SUCK
[1:03:09] <%umbypokochan> FF2 is great if you like Saga games
[1:03:09] <b1gboss007> Final fantasy starts at XV
[1:03:13] <+PipIV> shit at cards

[1:03:18] <JamvaanPS4> God yeah.
[1:03:20] <TheNeedlesD> True
[1:03:21] <Eresus> true
[1:03:24] <Endlesslyforgetful> yeah
[1:03:24] <%AbnormalVoid> Laguna is the only good character
[1:03:25] <%genowyn> Hot take: 7 is extremely overrated
[1:03:25] <FourthAve> laguna is sick
[1:03:27] <%Hispanacomida25> Hello Twitch I need to reverse all my months of subs because I was bullied for loving Triple Triad
[1:03:27] <KayThree> this is objectively correct
[1:03:29] <%Typhaeon> Laguna's buddies are more interesting than your team too

[1:03:48] <+TsunamiPoro> 13-3 is better than most final fantasies
[1:03:49] <%AbnormalVoid> Rinoa is the biggest basic bitch in anything
[1:03:50] <humblebundleshill> IAMGAMES
[1:03:51] <+ThatGuyfromMars> 8 is so fucking long too, FOUR DISCS!
[1:03:52] <+JenovasPuppet> Yeah, but 7 still got multiple sequels.
[1:03:54] <%StridentSong> Now to throw money at them
[1:03:58] <AncelDeLambert> Laguna is far more intruiging
[1:04:07] <XyraFhoan> 7 without all the side BS is still pretty good
[1:04:10] <theangryguyofde> FF8 the quest to figure out how to say Quistis name NotLikeThis
[1:04:11] <%genowyn> Hot take 2: Junction is a cool system
[1:04:12] <%Remery_> FF4 will never be the same
[1:04:14] <%Typhaeon> He's a dead type
[1:04:17] <JamvaanPS4> Jobber
[1:04:17] <wsintai> @PeachSaliva Final Fantasy 2 is the best FF game, and you secretly know it to be true
[1:04:18] <XdaXcaptainX> Actual hot take, FFXII is the most underrated FF in the west and deserves a place in most peoples top 3
[1:04:19] <Rezroc> 12 was the worst
[1:04:21] <+TsunamiPoro> is this the zapping system
[1:04:22] <%Hispanacomida25> Saying 13 is good is like saying I like to stare at the sun because its hot
[1:04:23] <Cryomancer_Maurice> FF6 is still best FF
[1:04:25] <AncelDeLambert> Quistis is hot af
[1:04:27] <mercado94> rinoa looks so good in the new dissidia. shamr the game is Garbage
[1:04:29] <$konekoryugamine> Here's a GOOD one: anyone here seen that new Slenderman movie?
[1:04:33] <%Typhaeon> @Cryomancer_Maurice Goddamn right
[1:04:34] <PakuV2> Dwagoom
[1:04:36] <fillmydarksoulwithlight> LOWKEY 13 IS FUN
[1:04:36] <ragasquid> I've never beat a final fantasy but 12 was really interesting
[1:04:38] <+TsunamiPoro> but i want the edge
[1:04:38] <TheNeedlesD> Whatever the fuck Sabin is is my Favorite Class
[1:04:38] <Rezroc> FLOOR TANK
[1:04:39] <KayThree> PLD or bust
[1:04:40] <%AbnormalVoid> the memory erasure sub-plot in 8 is the worst most hamfisted instance of that trope ever
[1:04:41] <Logan_Jennings1> Man this just makes me want to play Tactics again.
[1:04:41] <Tuskor13> red mage all the way
[1:04:44] <+OmegaWeltall> BlackMage is best Mage
[1:04:45] <FourthAve> theres a ton of time inconsistency in 8 which made the plot make next to no sense
[1:04:46] <+BlainPLD> i love 8 but it has major problems.
[1:04:46] <lilybergo> Its not edgy, Dragoon is Dumb Bitch Energy
[1:04:49] <InspectahDecck> 13 Could have been amazing
[1:04:52] <%Typhaeon> DRG master race
[1:04:52] <$konekoryugamine> FINAL FANTASY 13 SUCKS
[1:04:52] <%genowyn> I don't see how 12 is underrated. I feel like the only person in the world who doesn't like it
[1:04:56] <Eresus> dragoons were always garbage
[1:04:59] <+reycharles75> forsenPuke
[1:04:59] <Rezroc> Warrior is best DPS in FF14 Kappa
[1:05:01] <InspectahDecck> But it was so fucking linear
[1:05:01] <+Pat_Squared> Junction is a cool system idea, but its execution is so flawed
[1:05:04] <JamvaanPS4> Dark Knight s are the edgelords now.
[1:05:04] <XyraFhoan> 12 HD really helped it out
[1:05:06] <theangryguyofde> Dragons are known for jumping
[1:05:08] <SquadTeddy> DRK in 14 should have been dps
[1:05:08] <$GohanEgret> @genowyn add me to that list
[1:05:09] <XdaXcaptainX> most people i know have never even played it
[1:05:10] <%umbypokochan> Red Mage best
[1:05:14] <XyraFhoan> PS2 12 was kind of meh on release
[1:05:14] <shadowgilgamesh> 12 is my favorite, and zodiac made it even better
[1:05:16] <Coystick> Ntr
[1:05:18] <AncelDeLambert> Hell, I love the Legiana armor in MonHun because it looks like a FF dragoon
[1:05:19] <+RafflesiaA> 13 is dumb, 13-2 was almost better but the story tanked super hard
[1:05:22] <Dr_Donkey_Brains> just leave edward to die
[1:05:36] <TheNeedlesD> Order your MickeyDs
[1:05:36] <PakuV2> Dragoon is best because lances are underrated
[1:05:37] <$konekoryugamine> Someone actually TRIED to sell me a copy of FF13
[1:05:38] <+TDotGoat> The Hunger
[1:05:39] <%genowyn> 12 feels like an mmo
[1:05:39] <Prevot> McDonalds incoming
[1:05:39] <+PipIV> that's a lotta damage
[1:05:40] <hntronium> The baby is taking half of your food
[1:05:42] <Rezroc> All you have to do to like Dragoon is watch the FF14 Heavensward cinematic trailer.
[1:05:42] <outis94> el pregante paige
[1:05:46] <$GohanEgret> METAL GEAR AWESOME
[1:05:46] <+JenovasPuppet> Metal Gear Awesome
[1:05:47] <JamvaanPS4> 12 TZA is a game Ill stand up for but I quietly enjoyed 12 on ps2
[1:05:48] <TerraWraith> Metal Gear Awesome
[1:05:48] <XyraFhoan> 13 is super dumb, the character motivations just don't make sense and the little journal summaries have to patch things up that don't come across in the cinematics
[1:05:48] <%Remery_> Only Mc Donalds will sate yoou
[1:05:49] <wsintai> @AncelDeLambert I like the Behemoth armor in MH World, because it is the Dragoon armor
[1:05:50] <+TsunamiPoro> MGA
[1:05:52] <TheNeedlesD> Metal Gear Awesome, yes Ego
[1:05:52] <PowerfulBlackGangs> Metal Gear AWESOME
[1:05:53] <Dreigun> good old newgrounds
[1:05:53] <outis94> mg awesome
[1:05:57] <@PinkieTheEerie> MG awesome
[1:05:58] <LGWPhanto> Freya's got the best jump animation imo, throwing the spear down before landing
[1:05:59] <Logan_Jennings1> Metal Gear Awesome.
[1:06:00] <BakerBrute> Thats metal gear awesome
[1:06:06] <nooblord_derpington> METAL GEAR
[1:06:06] <+d00msdaydan> i still don't get that line at all
[1:06:08] <XdaXcaptainX> i feel like Zodiac is too easy.
[1:06:14] <$konekoryugamine> @PeachSaliva Seriously, someone TRIED to sell me on the "awesome" that was Final Fantasy 13. I SAID NO.
[1:06:17] <cherubsanonymous> Remember when Egoraptor did things?
[1:06:18] <roboguy2k> Here's a real unpopular opinion, FF7 is underrated because so many people call it overrated without actually playing it
[1:06:22] <+PipIV> let's destroy metal gear
[1:06:23] <Dire_Newt> rip funny egoraptor
[1:06:23] <TheGuesty> Jack Ryan gives 400 bits
[1:06:23] <$GohanEgret> @d00msdaydan neither do I, i've pondered it for years
[1:06:26] <AncelDeLambert> @peachsaliva do you like Legend of Dragoon?
[1:06:28] <Luesagna00> @peachsaliva big hungry? i took i BIG shit today TWICE. and my appetite been up lately.
[1:06:30] <%AbnormalVoid> @roboguy2k hear hear
[1:06:31] <MoulesFritz> 9 > 10 > 6 > 4 > 7 > 1 > 8 > 13 > 3 > 2
[1:06:34] <%Typhaeon> They both suck ass
[1:06:35] <+TsunamiPoro> nobody likes lightning
[1:06:36] <mercado94> agree
[1:06:36] <+JenovasPuppet> Man that's not even fair.
[1:06:39] <Darren716> 10 times 0 is still 0
[1:06:44] <MookStyfawker> Agree.
[1:06:44] <XdaXcaptainX> >9 at the top
[1:06:44] <ragasquid> Should I reinstall Lost Odyssey?
[1:06:45] <XdaXcaptainX> lol
[1:06:45] <XyraFhoan> Lightning is big bland
[1:06:47] <theangryguyofde> @konekoryugamine Someone tried to convince that it gets better 10 hours in LUL
[1:06:50] <$konekoryugamine> CAW CAW CAW CAW CAW
[1:06:50] <FourthAve> squall is a sassy boy
[1:06:51] <%Hispanacomida25> I love Lightning's design, but her personality is poopoo
[1:06:51] <Coystick> Squall a best YA'LL SHIT
[1:06:52] <JamvaanPS4> Thats true and the reason XIII is worse than 8
[1:06:52] <+Sonik2324> ffxi > everything else
[1:06:54] <%genowyn> What a low bar
[1:06:54] <fillmydarksoulwithlight> Every Dragoon is the best. Kain, Freyja, Kimahri, Fang. Every single one is great.
[1:06:57] <Bouldus> how is that even a comment, no shit lightning is a a doll the dev wanted to fuck
[1:06:58] <TheNeedlesD> yes Ragasquid
[1:06:58] <PakuV2> Lightning vs Squall is Cardboard vs Cardboard with salt on it
[1:06:59] <Animeshowfan> i know noting of final fantasy so im just chilling trying to understand all this
[1:07:01] <%AbnormalVoid> Rinoa has no personality either
[1:07:03] <PowerfulBlackGangs> Squall grows over time at least
[1:07:03] <$konekoryugamine> @theangryguyofde THAT'S WHAT HE TOLD ME! XD
[1:07:04] <+JenovasPuppet> Cloud is pretty alright.
[1:07:04] <Antrodox> damn
[1:07:04] <XyraFhoan> FF7 Cloud has tons of personality
[1:07:04] <+Pat_Squared> his personality is just asshole
[1:07:06] <lilybergo> Clouds fucking GREAT
[1:07:06] <mikesrsly> 8 is no 13, but it’s pretty bad.
[1:07:07] <hntronium> Cloud is such a dork
[1:07:07] <%Remery_> Not even Hentai can make Lightning interesting
[1:07:07] <SquadTeddy> Cloud is good stop.. no
[1:07:08] <%stovetopism> Literally not that hard to be more interesting than lighting
[1:07:09] <MookStyfawker> By the end of FF8 Squall starts to be a character and then the game ends.
[1:07:09] <Endlesslyforgetful> squal tries to b cool and isnt and everyone knos hes lame i love it
[1:07:09] <XyraFhoan> Let's mosey
[1:07:10] <AncelDeLambert> @pakuv2 LUL LUL LUL
[1:07:12] <ragasquid> Aight
[1:07:13] <FourthAve> zell though
[1:07:13] <+PipIV> THEY'RE WRONG
[1:07:13] <emoonimoo> Cloud is awesome
[1:07:15] <+TsunamiPoro> cloud is like jotaro, he has personality that isnt as expressive
[1:07:17] <hntronium> Spoilers
[1:07:18] <Bouldus> no his personality is bad is all
[1:07:18] <SquadTeddy> Cloud is best
[1:07:19] <FourthAve> hotdogs
[1:07:21] <%AbnormalVoid> Cloud is fantastic
[1:07:22] <mercado94> cloud is a funny asshole early inthe game
[1:07:23] <+Hinasil> Lightning has tons of personality though
[1:07:25] <%craig_t> ffvii is too long and old, and i could never get into it
[1:07:27] <Cryomancer_Maurice> Cloud's personality isn't as good as other protagonist.
[1:07:27] <$konekoryugamine> YOU DID NOT JUST COMPARE CLOUD TO JOTARO
[1:07:28] <mikesrsly> Cloud is just emo boy.
[1:07:28] <$GohanEgret> i think people think of cloud as how he looks as opposed to the game itself
[1:07:28] <%Typhaeon> Bah gawd it's Kain
[1:07:29] <%StridentSong> Cloud is fucked up on mako poisoning for like 2/3rds of the game. He thinks he's someone else. Once he recovers, he's a lot more interesting
[1:07:30] <AncelDeLambert> Yeah, but Tifa is x1000 better than Rinoa
[1:07:36] <SatansDick1> ive never played any final fantasy games
[1:07:36] <kingofasgard> Cloud fucking crossdresses and loves every minute
[1:07:37] <$konekoryugamine> OH GOD I NEED TO FUCKING WASH MY HANDS NOW
[1:07:41] <+JenovasPuppet> It's questionable how much is personality and how much is bad translation. "Let's mosey!"
[1:07:41] <shadowgilgamesh> cloud got lobotimized in FF7 expanded universe
[1:07:42] <+dahaxguy> Cloud outside of FF7 has no personality.
[1:07:43] <KayThree> "yea no big deal hehe kid"
[1:07:46] <%AbnormalVoid> Kain is a cuck LUL
[1:07:48] <+FadingEmber> !uptime
[1:07:49] <crimsonharvest> TED WOOLSEY HAVE MY BABIES
[1:07:52] <Animeshowfan> the only final fantasy ive played was 7 and honestly i really didnt like it i quit after like maybe 3 hours maybe?
[1:07:52] <fillmydarksoulwithlight> Lightning geuinely has a personality. Its 13-2 and 13-3 that fucked it up.
[1:07:53] <%Hispanacomida25> Remember with Advent Children and Kingdom Hearts removes all of Cloud of his personality from everything he did in FF7?
[1:07:53] <mercado94> NO ITEMS
[1:07:56] <XyraFhoan> Cloud has legit character development and Advent Children like... forgot about it to be "cool"
[1:07:58] <theangryguyofde> Kain isva Dyuk DarkMode
[1:07:59] <mercado94> FINAL DESTINATION
[1:08:00] <LGWPhanto> Cloud's personality is summed up in "Let's Mosey"
[1:08:00] <%Remery_> Not even Hentai can make Lightning interesting
[1:08:01] <+ThatGuyfromMars> yeah but Lighting was the face for Louis Vuitton for a while, which is the most surreal thing
[1:08:02] <ragasquid> D R A G O O N F I G H T
[1:08:05] <+JenovasPuppet> "If I can't pierce Rosa I'll pierce you!"
[1:08:06] <%SomeNEET> cheer100 cheer100 cheer100 cheer185 Final Fantasy IX is the best and Vivi is best boi, fucking fite me cowards
[1:08:09] <$Razputin217> TRAITOR
[1:08:09] <%AbnormalVoid> Kain gets big friendzoned and super butthurt
[1:08:16] <Luesagna00> @peachsaliva dont u think kaine head looks like a BUTT from the back?
[1:08:19] <AncelDeLambert> Vivi has ALL the feels
[1:08:21] <arcaderabbit48> Oh god, he's support right
[1:08:21] <Rezroc> I think most people who said Cloud has no personality only watched Advent Children
[1:08:24] <$konekoryugamine> C U C K E D
[1:08:25] <%Remery_> Vivi SAVED that game
[1:08:27] <$konekoryugamine> Had to do it.
[1:08:28] <reonome> GET REKT CECIL
[1:08:28] <Gerik1233> No pat is right for cecil's name
[1:08:28] <%craig_t> people's perception of cloud as a characetr have been suepr warped by all the shit made after ffvii
[1:08:29] <Bouldus> VIVI is the best ff characetr
[1:08:30] <Cryomancer_Maurice> Why is Kain dressed like Aquaman?
[1:08:32] <PowerfulBlackGangs> Did she just try to heal Kain?
[1:08:34] <%craig_t> even i know that
[1:08:41] <Bouldus> everyone else can go fuck themselves
[1:08:44] <Bouldus> vivi or bust
[1:08:51] <AncelDeLambert> Squaresoft saved up all the personality they should have used in 7 and 8 and gave it all to Zidane
[1:08:52] <crimsonharvest> There are rules for how many colors a sprite must have depending on size.
[1:08:59] <$konekoryugamine> Who's Zidane again?
[1:09:02] <%Hispanacomida25> Like he was so full of personality after the subconcious thing with Tifa and he immediately loses it because of edgy rewrites
[1:09:05] <Cryomancer_Maurice> Monkey boy.
[1:09:05] <fillmydarksoulwithlight> @remery_ oh my god oh my god in a game that had Quina and that's your position
[1:09:09] <MoulesFritz> ff9, the best ever FF
[1:09:10] <XdaXcaptainX> it might be related to onscreen color limits
[1:09:13] <+MechaTheSpider> FFV is super rad, ever get to play it, guys?
[1:09:14] <LGWPhanto> Beatrix tho
[1:09:18] <Rezroc> Racist Wakka is the BEST Final Fantasy character. Period. Dont @ me/
[1:09:19] <AncelDeLambert> @konekoryugamine FF9 main char
[1:09:20] <%Hispanacomida25> Watch him lose all of that in the FF7 remake
[1:09:25] <$konekoryugamine> @AncelDeLambert Thank you
[1:09:26] <+TsunamiPoro> ayyy im walkin ere
[1:09:28] <hntronium> Its unfortunate, but I couldn't squash that talk about people thinking fuggins and pat were together in the clip
[1:09:31] <$konekoryugamine> WHY SO UPSET, KAIN?!
[1:09:37] <$konekoryugamine> REMEMBER ME>!
[1:09:38] <AncelDeLambert> monkey tail guy
[1:09:38] <XyraFhoan> hot take all the PS1 FF titles are good, even FF8 even though it goes off the deep end after disc 2
[1:09:40] <Prevot> wat
[1:09:41] <Bouldus> lol
[1:09:42] <arcaderabbit48> Dissidia is the weirdest about it, because Terra is actually strawberry blonde there, like her character art, but her in-game sprite was like aqua teal hair
[1:09:43] <$konekoryugamine> I'M THE ONE WHO KILLED YOUR BROTHER?!
[1:09:44] <studleydoorite> it's the opposite of the Face/Off thing
[1:09:46] <$GohanEgret> @Rezroc did somebody say final solution?
[1:09:46] <$konekoryugamine> I TALKED JUST LIKE THIS!
[1:09:47] <+TsunamiPoro> NANI
[1:09:52] <+BlainPLD> Why arent we playing the better version of this?
[1:09:58] <Cryomancer_Maurice> Everytime I hear don't look at me I just think about Darkman?
[1:10:03] <Eresus> GOLBEZ!
[1:10:04] <$konekoryugamine> I'm actually laughing over my stupid joke I am so pathetic XD
[1:10:06] <%Remery_> @fillmydarksoulwithlight she stayed out of my party, I was young when I played and her gimmick confused me
[1:10:07] <TerraWraith> IT"S GANNON
[1:10:08] <AncelDeLambert> is Paige going crazy?
[1:10:17] <lilybergo> TAKE MY GREETING
[1:10:18] <TerraWraith> He sream
[1:10:19] <CybertronPrime> VADER- I mean GOLBEZ!
[1:10:19] <Coystick> GOLBEZ IS A BEAST
[1:10:20] <%krawtch> FF8 is good until you meet the character who turns it into the most boring stupid love story ever... so it's good for like 3 hours
[1:10:23] <$GohanEgret> E L M O
[1:10:23] <Endlesslyforgetful> take. my greeting
[1:10:26] <+PipIV> apatPorgmo

[1:11:06] <+TsunamiPoro> this game is many years older than me
[1:11:06] <fillmydarksoulwithlight> @remery_ fair enough. And yeah she was the Blue Mage. Blue Mages are never all that popular. See Kimahri and Quistis.
[1:11:09] <whimsicallifestyle> mraahhh
[1:11:12] <arcaderabbit48> @Remery_ Basically, yes. They ate a weakened enemy, and if it was the right type of enemy, they got a new spell. Like an even more cimplicated Blue Mage
[1:11:12] <$konekoryugamine> KItty kitty baby!

[1:11:54] <FeelinNifty> paige have a great day
[1:11:57] <studleydoorite> Elmo loves the abuse, he's a masochist
[1:11:58] <+MechaTheSpider> ever play FFV?
[1:11:59] <Logan_Jennings1> @PeachSaliva Do everything and nothing so you can please and punish everyone!
[1:12:00] <AncelDeLambert> Basically the Blue Mage shouldn't be used unless the game has a job system, a la FFX-2
[1:12:01] <lennonbad> get that kitty
[1:12:03] <Cherokia666> It's like complimenting the dialog and plot while skipping over it.
[1:12:03] <XyraFhoan> baby screm
[1:12:04] <%Hispanacomida25> @PeachSaliva The DS version of this game has some great line reading in the cutscenes, this being one of them along with Rydia's "I HATE YOU!". So dope
[1:12:05] <+PalmtopNami> Ay, how goes it
[1:12:11] <crimsonharvest> fuckin thats my rupee you bastard
[1:12:13] <arcaderabbit48> @AncelDeLambert I heard they were super cool in 11? They were really good mage-tanks and they got their powers by literally grafting pieces of monsters in to their bodies
[1:12:14] <Cryomancer_Maurice> She is now in Golbez inventory.
[1:12:14] <+TsunamiPoro> he looks kinda like meta knight
[1:12:20] <nooblord_derpington> Elmo CoolCat
[1:12:23] <Luesagna00> @peachsaliva they used royalty classical organ pieces i'm sure
[1:12:23] <Cryomancer_Maurice> Women are accessories for men, confirmed.
[1:12:33] <%krawtch> lel u almost die cecel.
[1:12:33] <crimsonharvest> Ted Woolsey is about to fuck us all in the eyes
[1:12:36] <MementoExtasis> ARE WE ON THE MOON YET? PogChamp
[1:12:44] <fillmydarksoulwithlight> @anceldelambert they're the best if you take the five minutes to get their abilities. So many FF don't ever make it clear but like in 8 Quistis can be the most busted shit ever on Disk1 before you get your Disk 1 Lionheart
[1:12:46] <Zaphire_Saucypants> smack dat cat booty
[1:12:47] <Luesagna00> as in classical music fromBach or soemthing
[1:12:49] <arcaderabbit48> @Remery_ They just aren't worth it. Every character in that game can bust the game wide open, so why bother with the one that needs so much specific setup?
[1:12:51] <PakuV2> sadboys
[1:12:52] <theangryguyofde> I mean...can Pat equip Paige to give +1 reach?
[1:12:53] <PowerfulBlackGangs> More like Lolbez
[1:12:55] <nooblord_derpington> CoolCat CoolCat CoolCat CoolCat CoolCat
[1:13:03] <reonome> is rydia hot now
[1:13:08] <MarylandJutsu> YE YE RYDIA BEST GIRL
[1:13:13] <+TsunamiPoro> the only good part about ff15 is gladio
[1:13:13] <MarylandJutsu> @reonome no shes a still a child
[1:13:15] <emoonimoo> THIS time
[1:13:17] <Prevot> this is a no lolis stream
[1:13:18] <reonome> damn
[1:13:25] <Eresus> @crimsonharvest woolsey didn't work on the translation of ff4
[1:13:31] <+PipIV> dumb dee dumb
[1:13:33] <TheNeedlesD> Lately he's been a loser
[1:13:34] <AncelDeLambert> Quistis is like the one character blue mage that gets a pass because they actually put time into her.
[1:13:36] <%AbnormalVoid> his character development is fantastic
[1:13:38] <MementoExtasis> Weed wizard PogChamp
[1:13:39] <%krawtch> cant wait for the remake to ruin everything
[1:13:48] <AncelDeLambert> All the ones after her feel like afterthoughts
[1:13:50] <XyraFhoan> I love Quistis, her design is great and her moves are great
[1:13:53] <Cryomancer_Maurice> But Pat, everyone loves Firion.
[1:14:00] <theangryguyofde> The king was wounded by having too much poop TPFufun
[1:14:01] <lilybergo> it sucks people harp on FFXV so much cos the 4 boys are incredible
[1:14:03] <%stovetopism> Personally I like FF9's ost the best, lots of somber songs and that rendition of the main theme at the end is beautiful
[1:14:06] <AncelDeLambert> Like, it feels like they had to MAKE SOMETHING UP to be the blue mage
[1:14:17] <arcaderabbit48> @AncelDeLambert Thoughts on the FFV variation, or do you mean specific characters? Cause its hard to argue with you if you mean specific characters
[1:14:18] <+rei0> yeah, my DQ11 runs real good on my pc
[1:14:23] <crimsonharvest> DQ11 is so GOOD its the most chrono trigger game since chrono trigger
[1:14:25] <+TsunamiPoro> Clemps is making a vid on it so you can just wait for his video
[1:14:27] <Endlesslyforgetful> dragon warrior is where its AT
[1:14:28] <TheNeedlesD> Leave DQXI to Paige
[1:14:32] <i_DRiFT> Sega PC games run great
[1:14:33] <PakuV2> I gotta get DQ11, but first I gotta get some MUNY
[1:14:34] <$GohanEgret> play dragon quest heroes rocket slime
[1:14:35] <ToneBacas> it's true. almost every PC port coming from a japanese company has issues, and people like Durante comes along with DSFix
[1:14:37] <XyraFhoan> blue mage in V and enemy magic materia in 7 are both nuts when you put the work in
[1:14:38] <+OmegaWeltall> i had to refund DQ11, i just didnt play the thing
[1:14:41] <+DarkNerdShawny> You play FF buut not DQ? WTF Pat?
[1:14:44] <PakuV2> Should I start a gofundme?
[1:14:46] <+8bitbandito> Cloud is a interesting character because he's actually losing his mind for half of that game.
[1:14:50] <outis94> i was playing the 3ds verion of8 it was great
[1:14:54] <Animeshowfan> ive heard its pretty good pat maybe you could give it a try on stream some time
[1:14:56] <theangryguyofde> I question my relationship with people that don't like dq11 and Kiwami 2
[1:15:06] <$Kain5707> limesPoggers
[1:15:10] <RunningNGunning> Dragon quest is like final fantasy without the sci fi elements
[1:15:13] <AncelDeLambert> I've only played since 6 on, I'm afraid. And 7 and 12 don't have dedicated blue mages, everyone can use those skills with materia or licenses
[1:15:15] <%krawtch> if you dont like kiwami or kiwami 2 then its probably because you dont know whats good
[1:15:16] <$Kain5707> FeelsBadMan
[1:15:19] <MarylandJutsu> BEST FRIEND IS ELLMOOOOOO
[1:15:20] <MarylandJutsu> NOW
[1:15:20] <%Remery_> @arcaderabbit48 yea I had the main hero Vivi and the little mage cat girl. Vivi's interactions with that wizard village and the wizard bosses made me cry as a kid. I think they all got wiped out not sure.
[1:15:21] <+PipIV> bruh
[1:15:23] <+RafflesiaA> I bought DQ11 but I haven't popped it in yet. Looking forward to it though.
[1:15:23] <$konekoryugamine> NOOOOO
[1:15:24] <Cryomancer_Maurice> What a downgrade.
[1:15:25] <%TrevyWeaponsGuy> Edmo
[1:15:25] <cherubsanonymous> Elmard
[1:15:27] <+TsunamiPoro> friendship ended with kain, new best friend is elmo

[1:15:31] <%Wallabri> Friendship ended with Kain
[1:15:35] <crimsonharvest> THAT SWORD yeaaaaaa its time to wreck shit
[1:15:41] <+PipIV> LAT!
[1:15:41] <Eresus> @8bitbandito yep, it's a protagonist with what is esentially a mental illness, and that makes him very interesting
[1:15:43] <AncelDeLambert> Kimarhi kinda blows, the weird chef thing in 9 is weird
[1:15:46] <$GohanEgret> B L A C K
[1:15:47] <+JenovasPuppet> Steal the king's shit!
[1:15:48] <+Slimshazbot> I asked a really cute girl out today and she actually said yes! Now I just need to not horribly fuck up the date gmartHype
[1:15:49] <%stovetopism> As much as it hurts, I gotta wait on getting dq11
[1:15:51] <%Typhaeon> Now you can be all black
[1:15:52] <arcaderabbit48> @Remery_ Vivi is so amazing and he goes through so much.
[1:15:52] <+TsunamiPoro> BLACK EVIL
[1:15:55] <Prevot> Da Black Sword
[1:15:56] <%AbnormalVoid> the black evil!
[1:16:04] <%Hispanacomida25> Wait, isnt FuYoSa in this game or am I thinking of V?
[1:16:05] <suhmguy> Boat trip in a Final Fantasy game, surely nothing bad will happen Kappa
[1:16:06] <outis94> thats leons sword from 2
[1:16:06] <%TenderBabyBacon> He is now holding a long black object. That is slightly fist shaped
[1:16:07] <Cryomancer_Maurice> More black. Can't get enough of that black. No turning back.
[1:16:10] <$konekoryugamine> Just replace Zubaz as Golbez and we have a hype ass game
[1:16:12] <zaitje> Black rosé
[1:16:16] <MarylandJutsu> BIG CRYSTALS
[1:16:22] <+TsunamiPoro> replace all characters in fiction with zubaz

[1:16:54] <Coystick> When's BREATH OF FIRE IV?
[1:16:55] <+PipIV> we were talking about dairy queen 11
[1:16:57] <%Remery_> @arcaderabbit48 yea kinda like Emil in Nier. Remember playing FF tactics and had 1-2 mages just because they reminded me of Vivi. Use to have a plush version
[1:16:59] <Animeshowfan> holy shit look at this dancing magical women
[1:17:02] <MarylandJutsu> @konekoryugamine lol well fair

[1:17:37] <theangryguyofde> Pat you are full of shit you have no emotions SwiftRage
[1:17:37] <%umbypokochan> 3 is best, especially SNES version
[1:17:38] <MarylandJutsu> ELEVEN IS GREEAAATTTT
[1:17:39] <%galaxyswirl> 8 is alright
[1:17:40] <ryu1299> how does 11 compare to 8
[1:17:42] <arcaderabbit48> @Remery_ Vivi is so good, he got a big send-up in FF14. Shame he STILL isn't playable in any Dissidia game.
[1:17:44] <ShreddingPixels> DQ is too old school.
[1:17:46] <Cryomancer_Maurice> It's THAC0
[1:17:48] <AncelDeLambert> The original Dragon Warrior is my jam
[1:17:50] <ragasquid> what
[1:17:50] <roboguy2k> Only 2 and 6 are weaker, but not exactly bad
[1:17:51] <%galaxyswirl> ITS SO BRIT

[1:18:04] <+rei0> agreed with pat on that
[1:18:04] <Eresus> all toriyama's characters look the same to be honest
[1:18:05] <+cvp5127> ???
[1:18:05] <@PinkieTheEerie> WHAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAT
[1:18:06] <ShreddingPixels> Pat is right is for once,
[1:18:06] <reonome> toriyama sucks
[1:18:07] <%Remery_> @arcaderabbit48 I would pay Dissidia if Vivi is in it
[1:18:08] <joecool1216> chrono trigger is dope
[1:18:08] <+Sonik2324> pat is right
[1:18:08] <AggsMK7> I like his sci fi stuff more than his fantasy stuff
[1:18:10] <@PinkieTheEerie> NO ART IS BEST
[1:18:12] <+MechaTheSpider> "good morning, Chrono"
[1:18:12] <%krawtch> crono is a ginj duh
[1:18:12] <heatrashes> the one time pat is 100% right
[1:18:13] <arcaderabbit48> ITS 4 FACES, TEN OUTFITS, AND TWO PAIRS OF SHOES IN CONSTANT FLUX. FIGHT ME NERDS
[1:18:13] <$konekoryugamine> WAIT. WAIT. WAIT. HOLD THE FUCKING PHONE. TORIYAMA MADE CHRONO CHROSS?!
[1:18:14] <@PinkieTheEerie> FUCK OFF
[1:18:15] <+RafflesiaA> My best friend has that same complaint with Toriyama so I figured taht'd be part of it
[1:18:16] <XdaXcaptainX> >thinking toriyama can draw even 5 different faces
[1:18:17] <%stovetopism> 8 is like the best one...OI GOV
[1:18:18] <$googleygareth> These are some hot takes LUL
[1:18:18] <%Remery_> @arcaderabbit48 play
[1:18:20] <MSN04_Sazabi> The main character of DQ XI looks like 17 with different hair colour
[1:18:21] <+Tacowavable> Totally agree
[1:18:25] <+TsunamiPoro> people who dont like toriyama's art aren't artists
[1:18:26] <@PinkieTheEerie> OI
[1:18:26] <TheNeedlesD> Good Morning Crono
[1:18:26] <Bouldus> yea your right
[1:18:27] <+wJorray> I mean Pat isn't wrong
[1:18:27] <+MechaTheSpider> You know that pic of the two vegitas
[1:18:27] <Gerik1233> i kinda get it
[1:18:27] <+ruddyredbone> yeahhh
[1:18:28] <AncelDeLambert> Toriyama's art DOES get tiring, yes
[1:18:28] <joecool1216> I played the shit outta this game growing up
[1:18:31] <arcaderabbit48> @konekoryugamine He did the art for it
[1:18:33] <FourthAve> fair enough
[1:18:34] <SatansDick1> youre right but fuck you
[1:18:34] <+OmegaWeltall> yea... yea... dont care much for Toyama's work
[1:18:35] <omenesia> DQ8 h8 or gr8? u r8
[1:18:35] <Coystick> Thqt's fair
[1:18:36] <$konekoryugamine> WHAAAAAAAAT
[1:18:37] <reonome> he has serious samerface
[1:18:37] <MarylandJutsu> FRYING PAN
[1:18:37] <AggsMK7> Yang's Wife. Her mother had incredible foresight
[1:18:37] <hntronium> @konekoryugamine You didn't know he did that art?
[1:18:40] <AthenaAegis> I love Toriyama's Dragon Quest work
[1:18:41] <+OmegaWeltall> outside of Dragonball Z
[1:18:42] <$konekoryugamine> MY MIND IS FUCKING BLOWN RIGHT NOW!
[1:18:43] <PakuV2> DQ is obtuse in that sometimes it tells you to go "that way" and hope you get where you're supposed to be. Also it's grind hell. It fucking blows sometimes. That said, I love DQ
[1:18:44] <Animeshowfan> yeah you know what pat that is a legit reason . i like the guys art but he dos have issues making characters stand apart sometimes
[1:18:45] <SpookyCircus> what about jojo
[1:18:45] <+BlainPLD> Pat, Youre totally right, but i love his art!
[1:18:47] <$konekoryugamine> TORIYAMA DID THE ARTWORK
[1:18:47] <%rdark_ksu> Cast iron can kill like crazy
[1:18:47] <+PalmtopNami> i like his art but i also have that same gripe
[1:18:49] <theangryguyofde> he made a living only drawing five faces. Checkmate Pat TPFufun
[1:18:49] <XyraFhoan> Toriyama's got the worst same face issue
[1:18:51] <Basch71> most DQ heroes are just Gohan with different clothes
[1:18:51] <Prevot> Pat doesn't understand artstyles
[1:18:52] <Bouldus> GO FOR THE BOOTS
[1:18:54] <%TrevyWeaponsGuy> Pat, are you okay?
[1:18:56] <$googleygareth> @PeachSaliva Pat has just ruined chat by the way. apatWhat
[1:18:56] <+cvp5127> a lot of DQ main characters are just gokus
[1:18:56] <arcaderabbit48> @Remery_ Honestly, same. Locke is pretty cool, but I need a little more to go on than that
[1:18:57] <$Kain5707> lame
[1:18:57] <Cryomancer_Maurice> Yang's wife is look at Cecil and is like waiting to trade up for that BLACK knight.
[1:18:58] <cherubsanonymous> Toriyama is one of the most overrated creators in all of entertainment
[1:19:02] <mikesrsly> Toriyama can draw five characters!?
[1:19:04] <Luesagna00> I HATE how he always uses Trunks design, even bloo dragon or sum fuck.
[1:19:07] <Psyramics> Its either Goku, Picclgeta, or The Girl
[1:19:15] <Skeleton_Boner_Lord> DQ8 is great and now I wanna play it again
[1:19:17] <$GohanEgret> confirmed
[1:19:30] <+drewg91> "how dare someone not like an art style I enjoy"
[1:19:35] <ragasquid> Chrono Cross is good fuck you
[1:19:35] <+AmaniIsYourBoss> Officially ENDORSED tweet that confirms Pat's love of Chrono Cross.
[1:19:40] <Bouldus> yeyeyeyeye ff9
[1:19:43] <+MechaTheSpider> FFV IS THE BEST
[1:19:44] <Eresus> lol
[1:19:48] <+PipIV> oooh
[1:19:54] <MarylandJutsu> VIVI BEST BOY
[1:19:54] <theangryguyofde> Let's not judge Pat's taste of anime... because how do you judge nothing TPFufun
[1:19:56] <KayThree> I still love FF6 too much
[1:19:57] <%krawtch> i didnt believe it was really Pat until the tweet saying it was really Pat
[1:19:58] <SatansDick1> whats the best final fantasy
[1:20:00] <LeonSteel> FF9 IS THE BEST
[1:20:01] <AncelDeLambert> IDENTITY THEFT
[1:20:02] <+TsunamiPoro> The best final fantasy is Dirge of Cerberus
[1:20:02] <+DarkNerdShawny> Vivi is HORRIBLE
[1:20:03] <+OmegaWeltall> i hated everyone in FF9 except Vivi and Beatrix
[1:20:03] <MookStyfawker> Fuck you, Pat. IX for life.
[1:20:05] <KayThree> Celes best girl
[1:20:06] <+aversal_ammar> 9 has some problems
[1:20:12] <arcaderabbit48> Oh god please dont start this again
[1:20:14] <%Typhaeon> Freya is cool too
[1:20:15] <AncelDeLambert> Vivi is beautious boy
[1:20:15] <+DarkNerdShawny> VIVI is SHIT
[1:20:21] <%galaxyswirl> 6 is the best ff game ever
[1:20:23] <%Gouf_Troop> Kuja is still the best FF villian
[1:20:24] <joecool1216> FF6 is by far the best
[1:20:26] <AncelDeLambert> FF9 story is amazing
[1:20:26] <Cryomancer_Maurice> DId people actually play Final Fantasy 12?
[1:20:26] <Bouldus> Pat your meant to leave everyone behind and go andventuring jsut with vivi
[1:20:30] <%krawtch> edward constantly looking ashamed of his dick
[1:20:33] <AthenaAegis> Vivi is like Elmo or Liam, he's a good boy Kappa
[1:20:36] <AncelDeLambert> Yes, I played 12, what a mistake
[1:20:40] <+MechaTheSpider> BUTTS IS A GREAT MAIN CHARACTER
[1:20:44] <AggsMK7> I liked Vivi and his parallels to Garnet and Zidane
[1:20:51] <%Remery_> If you hate Vivi you have no soul
[1:20:57] <AncelDeLambert> Now we need art of Elmo in Vivi cosplay!!
[1:21:09] <$Kain5707> rip party
[1:21:11] <%Typhaeon> You had to spend hours drawing
[1:21:11] <+SeasonalWeasel> ff8 was rad
[1:21:14] <$GohanEgret> 12 is fun as a demo, a chore as a full game
[1:21:16] <%AbnormalVoid> the game barely had equipment
[1:21:20] <+DarkNerdShawny> FF* was great!
[1:21:21] <Cryomancer_Maurice> Are you sure you played Final Fantasy 12? Because I feel like that game never existed.
[1:21:21] <Dr_Donkey_Brains> that's not a problem
[1:21:22] <MSN04_Sazabi> It's like Oblivion
[1:21:22] <%krawtch> DRAW MAGIC. GOT 4. KILL YOURSELF.
[1:21:27] <+TsunamiPoro> if the enemies match your levels, why even have a leveling system
[1:21:27] <%AbnormalVoid> it's was so strategically bankrupt
[1:21:32] <Eresus> that person is WRONG
[1:21:34] <ragasquid> Even as a kid, i could tell ff2 was garbage
[1:21:36] <AncelDeLambert> Levels don't mean shit, it's all about the magic
[1:21:36] <XyraFhoan> FF8 you bust the game open with card games, the scaling can be worked in your favour
[1:21:44] <+TsunamiPoro> he snarr
[1:21:52] <+PipIV> we won't go quietly, the legion can count on that
[1:21:53] <AncelDeLambert> it required DIFFERENT grinding, jesus people
[1:21:56] <+SeasonalWeasel> i liked the junction and draw system
[1:22:00] <%krawtch> draw magic and then NEVER EVER USE IT because it makes your stats go down that are junctioned to it.
[1:22:02] <Thalchampz> yup, Cid's theme
[1:22:04] <+DarkNerdShawny> FINAL FANTASY MYSTIC QUEST IS THE BEEEESSSTT FINAL FANTASY GAME TO EXIST! DONT @ ME
[1:22:04] <arcaderabbit48> FF2 is honestly the game I want to see remade the most. It had an interesting leveling system and at least tried to have a plot, but boy has it aged incredibly poorly
[1:22:14] <+TsunamiPoro> Lol "Yang's Wife"
[1:22:15] <KayThree> this game is so wholesome sometimes, its great
[1:22:17] <kingofasgard> FF8's level scaling was the dumbest but you could get Lionheart in Disc 1, so it kinda balanced out.
[1:22:18] <FourthAve> all about the ff8 junction system
[1:22:20] <%gamesasacervix> cheer400 chrono cross suck
[1:22:23] <AncelDeLambert> the junctioning system was interesting and fresh, shame it was attached to 8
[1:22:25] <FourthAve> make yourself op
[1:22:25] <Animeshowfan> ok i think im going to go its late and im tired. have a good stream yall and i hope you get better soon pat
[1:22:26] <AggsMK7> Mystic Quest had decent music
[1:22:29] <+PipIV> Mrs. wife
[1:22:29] <Cryomancer_Maurice> I'm pretty sure Final Fantasy 12 doesn't exist and Japan just can't count.
[1:22:42] <+SeasonalWeasel> also Angelo is the best character in any FF
[1:22:45] <+Bupkis7> Hoi!
[1:22:48] <+SeasonalWeasel> Wowee
[1:22:52] <%TenderBabyBacon> HOI
[1:22:54] <MSN04_Sazabi> FF2 has the Elder Scrolls leveling system. Except it lacks all other TES elements which made that work.
[1:22:56] <%krawtch> final fantasy 12 on release was just a 50 hour cutscene because the game played itself
[1:23:00] <Dire_Newt> oh no, people are going to jerk off to cecil's feat
[1:23:01] <+RafflesiaA> FF12 is real and a nice game
[1:23:03] <+AmaniIsYourBoss> Do it do it do it do it do it
[1:23:06] <theangryguyofde> @cryomancer_maurice Maybe we weren't ready for chocolate bunnies NotLikeThis
[1:23:07] <Prevot> bUrself
[1:23:10] <mtgtin> OOF
[1:23:10] <+PipIV> hmmmm?
[1:23:16] <%AbnormalVoid> Conker has great humor, but as a game it sucks ass

[1:23:21] <$GohanEgret> @Prevot get outta here, genie
[1:23:29] <$googleygareth> Oh here we fuckin go
[1:23:30] <Bouldus> bad fur day has good multiplayer
[1:23:32] <+PipIV> naw
[1:23:33] <+ruddyredbone> ehh
[1:23:33] <%Typhaeon> As long as you don't do the shitty XBox remake that censors everything
[1:23:34] <arcaderabbit48> FF12 just never quite got me. It felt like there was something there, I just couldn't really get in to it
[1:23:35] <Cryomancer_Maurice> Stop lying. There's no such thing as Final Fantasy 12! This fake Wiki page doesn't prove anything
[1:23:37] <$googleygareth> What's your bad take now Pat.
[1:23:38] <Endlesslyforgetful> i played that multiplayer so much
[1:23:41] <+PipIV> naw, biatch
[1:23:45] <%krawtch> pat knows the furries will take over the chat
[1:23:45] <$Kage_96> WTF
[1:23:47] <$Kain5707> WHAT!
[1:23:48] <$GohanEgret> W H A T
[1:23:48] <AncelDeLambert> FFXII has the problems of both the Sphere Grid and Materia, everyone ends up as everything and there's no point to managing a party anymore
[1:23:48] <+Sp3ctre48> ???
[1:23:50] <PakuV2> Baki vs Predator is a thing, best timeline
[1:23:50] <Prevot> well Sunshine is shit
[1:23:52] <%AbnormalVoid> Paige and Pat, confirmed bad taste
[1:23:54] <+SeasonalWeasel> ??????????
[1:23:55] <$Kain5707> BAN HER!
[1:23:56] <LeonSteel> WHAT

[1:24:05] <StarlightGalactic> "everyone hates sunshine"
[1:24:07] <%Gouf_Troop> Sunshine is the best one tho
[1:24:11] <+Ascethetic> Sunshine>Galaxy, fite me
[1:24:12] <Cryomancer_Maurice> No it's not.
[1:24:12] <%galaxyswirl> wait what was that sbout sunshine pat???
[1:24:15] <+ThePayphone> but if she dont like mario bros 2 she a thot
[1:24:16] <joecool1216> SUNSHINE IS THE MOST UNDERRATED GAME EVER
[1:24:19] <Gerik1233> Sunshine is great! Fuck you all!
[1:24:22] <+PipIV> I LOVE Shunshine
[1:24:23] <arcaderabbit48> @AncelDeLambert And due to animation differences, and what small stat differences there are, the game has an objective Beast Party.
[1:24:24] <AncelDeLambert> Paige confirmed not Dunkey fan
[1:24:25] <+dahaxguy> I think Sunshine and Odd
[1:24:27] <+PipIV> oh wait
[1:24:29] <AggsMK7> He's right tho. People pile shit on Sunshine
[1:24:29] <Logan_Jennings1> Wait wait wait wait... did Pat just actually say "Mario' instead of Merry O?!
[1:24:30] <+JEiddew> How latea am I to the stream? Like should I wait for the VOD to see things in a way that makes sense?
[1:24:30] <+RafflesiaA> Sunshine's like the one 3D mario I even give a shit about
[1:24:35] <SatansDick1> pat being super wrong what a suprise
[1:24:36] <Cryomancer_Maurice> Sunshine's dumb; i wish it didn't exist like Final Fantasy 12.
[1:24:38] <$KnivesEve> galaxy introduced rosalina tho
[1:24:41] <TheNeedlesD> JRPGs always have a boat fight
[1:24:41] <%krawtch> there's the Japan i know
[1:24:43] <PakuV2> onionsan
[1:24:45] <+PipIV> I do like sunshine
[1:24:47] <AncelDeLambert> @arcaderabbit48 fucking what SERIOUSLY? that's wierd
[1:24:51] <XyraFhoan> Sunshine is great until you remember blue coin pixel hunts, pachinko, and other terrible side challenges
[1:24:52] <$GohanEgret> Sailors? SHENMUE?
[1:24:54] <+SeasonalWeasel> sunshine is actually one of the best tho

[1:25:34] <+PipIV> oh nuuuuu
[1:25:35] <+PalmtopNami> I take back what i said about thag donation now
[1:25:38] <AggsMK7> This was a bad plan
[1:25:39] <$GohanEgret> rosalina best girl, best princess, best best
[1:25:42] <arcaderabbit48> @AncelDeLambert Yep. Ashe, Knight Guy, and Vaan are statistically the best characters. Fran and Balthier are the worst, and their unique animations means giving them a Bow and Gun actually makes them attack slower than anyone else
[1:25:43] <outis94> you lose everyone
[1:25:43] <hntronium> STEVE
[1:25:45] <mistermastergreg> I like how there's only ONE airforce in the entire world
[1:25:47] <$KnivesEve> o_o ... curse you peach
[1:25:54] <fireking900> more like, Levia-chan VoHiYo
[1:25:55] <crimsonharvest> When this came out it was shocking to have a game with such a thing as a plot twist.
[1:25:55] <$Razputin217> and they all died, the end
[1:25:58] <MSN04_Sazabi> Berserk OP?

[1:26:53] <+PipIV> need to see grand wizard wala again
[1:26:58] <%krawtch> "three girlfriends go on a world tour with their cooters out" FFX-2 plot synopsis
[1:27:00] <+PipIV> waka
[1:27:02] <arcaderabbit48> @AncelDeLambert Ashe seems okay? But I never actually saw much of her? But otherwise yeah, Vaan is the best character in the game but also the absolute worst character in the game :/
[1:27:02] <fireking900> im playing FF9 rn, that game is alright
[1:27:07] <MarylandJutsu> OH NO PAIGE IS TOAD
[1:27:07] <Nordguy> I unironically love X-2, but only because it was my first FF game
[1:27:10] <+JenovasPuppet> Oh shit, do a reading of FFX-2.5!
[1:27:10] <%genowyn> Ten two has a great combat system and music but the story sucks
[1:27:15] <XyraFhoan> dress sphere is so rocking of a game mechanic
[1:27:16] <Dire_Newt> yo i heard there was a newt
[1:27:18] <PakuV2> Town of vivis
[1:27:18] <Darren716> Oh no he's going to fight Benoit on there
[1:27:20] <XyraFhoan> the plot is super bad though
[1:27:21] <Dire_Newt> im into it
[1:27:26] <shadowgilgamesh> X-2s battle theme makes me want to die
[1:27:30] <Cryomancer_Maurice> Don't die, Joey Janella
[1:27:30] <%TenderBabyBacon> x-2 is fun to play, but the plot is pretty awful
[1:27:32] <+RafflesiaA> I feel like X-2 and XIII-2 have the same problem of being actually pretty good video games but having a fucking terrible story you couldn't care less about
[1:27:40] <+PalmtopNami> The OG Berserk opening is fucking GREAT. Yall can lick my ass.
[1:27:41] <$googleygareth> LUL I know which one he means
[1:27:47] <ToneBacas> it's a sad day when Booker T gets a facefull of man butt
[1:27:49] <AncelDeLambert> @tenderbabybacon agreed, but still better in plot than ten
[1:27:50] <Bouldus> lol monty python
[1:27:55] <ToneBacas> live on "stage"
[1:28:00] <%genowyn> XIII-2 is better than XIII by like, a lot
[1:28:01] <$konekoryugamine> And I got over my mind blowing
[1:28:02] <Thalchampz> just talk to him again
[1:28:04] <%krawtch> i would say that all the 13 games have the problem of having terrible plots that are impossible to care about
[1:28:07] <+PalmtopNami> its dumb but its GREAT
[1:28:17] <PakuV2> Diddy King?
[1:28:18] <+Blargimazombie> So when are you going to play Banjo Kazooie?

[1:50:22] <theangryguyofde> I didn't know Pat was in FF4 LUL
[1:50:22] <@MelBrooksKA> Is "S'il vous plaît pas de vers" close?
[1:50:39] <arcaderabbit48> English is really bad, its true
[1:50:40] <+buttdirt> verre and tasse both mean cup
[1:50:53] <@MelBrooksKA> Part of English is FROM FRENCH
[1:50:54] <PakuV2> the word pronounced as "vehr" can mean "Worm", "Towards", and "green"
[1:50:54] <+GuelermeDias> english has pathetically easy grammar but the phonemes make no sense
[1:50:55] <%umbypokochan> S W O O N E D
[1:51:00] <Troispoint> La vrai poutine commence à Drummondville, that's all you need to learn
[1:51:00] <%krawtch> pat speaking french sounds like his tongue is falling out 60% of the time
[1:51:03] <%AbnormalVoid> English is better than French, because you speak it through your mouth instead of through your nose
[1:51:15] <sourigoth> ver = worm, verre = glass , vert = green
[1:51:15] <+JenovasPuppet> TWINNED

[1:51:30] <%cyberblade507> Put the camera closer to Elmo.
[1:51:32] <%umbypokochan> make Cecil a piggy!
[1:51:32] <%Kinoskae> Peach, the words "flammable" & "inflammable" have the same meaning in English, our language is busted
[1:51:33] <$GohanEgret> he scream
[1:51:38] <$konekoryugamine> Try learning Japanese.
[1:51:40] <$konekoryugamine> Or Korean.

[1:51:42] <hntronium> skrem
[1:51:46] <$konekoryugamine> Or Russian, honestly.
[1:51:47] <+GuelermeDias> those all sound very distinct

[2:03:55] <StrawberryPantsu> IM CALLING THE COPS
[2:03:58] <StrawberryPantsu> No
[2:04:00] <RunningNGunning> yes or no
[2:04:00] <AggsMK7> I wouldn't recommend it
[2:04:00] <%umbypokochan> i watch a streamer who does
[2:04:00] <hntronium> MARRIAGE-UANA
[2:04:01] <SatansDick1> considered
[2:04:02] <$GohanEgret> ask elmo musk Kappa
[2:04:03] <StrawberryPantsu> ToS fam
[2:04:03] <TheNeedlesD> Blaze it!
[2:04:03] <+JenovasPuppet> Probably? You can drink on stream, right?
[2:04:04] <AncelDeLambert> the cooking process greatly intensifies the active component of cannabis
[2:04:04] <jimmymnemonic> didn't snoop dogg smoke wee on stream
[2:04:04] <+spleekle> graph black does it
[2:04:05] <+MisterTylerrr> I mean, Joe Rogan and Elon Musk did it on Youtube.
[2:04:06] <+NWR_James> don't get caught
[2:04:07] <+PalmtopNami> YouTube you can
[2:04:11] <Twoiis> Probably not.
[2:04:11] <PakuV2> Twitch is a sovereign nation @PeachSaliva
[2:04:12] <+th3madness> Didn't stop musk
[2:04:12] <SatansDick1> considered self harm i think
[2:04:12] <+GuelermeDias> You can drink on stream
[2:04:12] <+gusdabus91> you 100% can
[2:04:14] <energywarning> it's already kinda iffy on talking about drugs on stream
[2:04:15] <Darren716> The fuck, why not ciggys?
[2:04:15] <AthenaAegis> No as far as I know
[2:04:16] <Logan_Jennings1> Probably not worth the risk?
[2:04:16] <+PalmtopNami> Joe Rogan does it on youtube.
[2:04:17] <hntronium> Didn't Snoop Dogg do that?
[2:04:18] <%Fedgle> smoke weed on stream
[2:04:19] <Reizunari> Pretend it's a cig
[2:04:19] <RedMaskBandit> Check ToS
[2:04:19] <%Hispanacomida25> Unless your Elon Musk, and you can away with being rich and white
[2:04:20] <%Fedgle> do it
[2:04:23] <%umbypokochan> i watch a streamer who takes bong hits
[2:04:27] <Darren716> Snoop Dogg did it
[2:04:27] <AncelDeLambert> yes, "a" weed. ONLY ONE.
[2:04:28] <Blackearache> LETS ALL GET HIGH
[2:04:28] <+Dingalow> I think if you can post shots of weed on Instagram you can get high on stream
[2:04:31] <%Ciphris> i love this game
[2:04:31] <EASrake> But what if you don't inhale
[2:04:32] <GoldeNOVA> Elon Musk did it
[2:04:32] <%krawtch> except criticize youtube. or post Alex Jones.
[2:04:33] <ToneBacas> on youtube you can film corpses
[2:04:34] <+NWR_James> You can kill a man on YouTube
[2:04:34] <%craig_t> ON YOUTUBE YOU'RE SUPER LIKELY TO GET DEMONETIZED
[2:04:34] <%genowyn> Except talk about the news
[2:04:42] <%Fedgle> pat confirmed for smoking on youtube
[2:04:43] <%Remery_> even MAKE A SANDWICH
[2:04:45] <Tucker0603> SNEK SPOTTED!
[2:04:46] <+GuelermeDias> As long as you don't go OH MY GOD THE WEED WE'RE DOING THE WEED I think it's fine
[2:04:46] <+DuffMacwhalen> You can do anything on youtube including spanking catrs.
[2:04:47] <$GohanEgret> CurseLit CurseLit
[2:04:49] <%krawtch> YouTube is immolating itself
[2:04:49] <Dr_Donkey_Brains> youtube shut down a bunch of weed channels
[2:04:50] <+spleekle> theres a streamer named "black" who does weed AMAs, long as is its in a state where its legal
[2:04:50] <StrawberryPantsu> I mean Joe Rogan tokes up on his pod cast all the time @PeachSaliva so i dont see why you couldnt
[2:04:52] <Arclight2879> Except be Alex Jones on YouTube
[2:04:57] <Worldbrand> I'd do a lot of things if they turned me into a demon
[2:05:03] <AggsMK7> Even Max is getting demonetized
[2:05:14] <+CrystalLakeWasJusASetback> YouTube is family friendly now.
[2:05:16] <ToneBacas> sounds fun
[2:05:16] <+GuelermeDias> are you saying max's content is drugs?
[2:05:21] <$GohanEgret> BibleThump
[2:05:21] <+Nomicro4u> Just send some nudes and you'll be good
[2:05:24] <synthcutter> oh god, im sorry
[2:05:29] <%genowyn> Max is a different situation. Some copyright troll company is buying up music libraries
[2:05:30] <AggsMK7> Boss Rage is basically drugs
[2:05:31] <%umbypokochan> yeah Pat, tickle her nose with a feather
[2:05:34] <jhp209> It sucks
[2:05:34] <+CrystalLakeWasJusASetback> @GuelermeDias Mortal Kombat
[2:05:42] <+Dingalow> Lad I saw a clip of some guy just smacking a corpse in an open casket on a Facebook stream
[2:05:43] <+TONYOO101> They say sleeping on your back causes sleep paralysis
[2:05:50] <+NWR_James> if she isnt moving while sleeping then wae her up
[2:05:50] <+vaporousTippler> Look into astral projection/lucid dreaming. Solved my sleep paralysis permanently.
[2:05:51] <+GuelermeDias> max's content is krokodil confirmed on stream
[2:05:51] <ToneBacas> LUL casually discussing horrible sleep paralysis episodes
[2:05:54] <bambowl> do you see the gobalins
[2:05:55] <Fujiwara_92> yeah, sleep paralysis is common for me too... it's kinda freaky but I'm accustomed at this point...
[2:06:01] <mayorrev> lucid dreaming 👀
[2:06:07] <AncelDeLambert> you can't even BREATHE properly when it happens
[2:06:07] <SuperNotSuspiciousMan> !uptime
[2:06:10] <Eresus> hit paige with the dreamnail
[2:06:25] <PakuV2> It's mindboggling how possession laws differ from city to city. Atlanta counts 1 ounce or less as a misdemeanor, New Orleans counts 60 lbs or less.
[2:06:25] <+Mr_Initials> My dreams know they are dreams
[2:06:26] <%krawtch> I get "sleep laziness" where I wake up but I don't want to get up so I just lie in bed awake, looking at memes or whatever for 3 hours
[2:06:26] <+Dingalow> I've heard lucid dreaming causes sleep paralysis
[2:06:27] <%rdark_ksu> I can lucid dream quite easily due to a lot of false awakening
[2:06:27] <AncelDeLambert> because you're awake and your brain needs awake oxygen, but you're sleep breathing AND FUCK THAT
[2:06:36] <%umbypokochan> @Eresus congratulations, you won the strim :)
[2:06:42] <+JenovasPuppet> Whaaaaaaaaat?!

[2:26:03] <outis94> animated meg toy was great
[2:26:09] <%TrevyWeaponsGuy> That sounds like Steven Universe
[2:26:11] <%Sadira_snack_attack> ....and war
[2:26:14] <PakuV2> Came to BEE, Waspinator is Old Testament God
[2:26:15] <%konekoryugamine> SCARSCREAM WAS AN AUTOBOT?!
[2:26:18] <+Nedlin> How do you two feel about Transformers Prime?
[2:26:19] <%TrevyWeaponsGuy> Rebecca and her anime
[2:26:21] <%konekoryugamine> BLASPHEMY!
[2:26:22] <%craig_t> i haven't watched any transformers shit in years
[2:26:29] <%craig_t> loved idw comics though
[2:26:30] <Arclight2879> OG Transformers was animated. i remember watching it on the bozo show.
[2:26:31] <MyDarkStorm> Transformers Cybertron was firetruck optimus
[2:26:37] <Zeikier> it's funny how so many shows of our childhood were Canadian made
[2:26:37] <%Ciphris> i didn't like the transformers with those annoying kids
[2:26:51] <+Skatedeandre> Who?
[2:26:51] <Zeikier> beast machines Cheetor is fucking hideous
[2:26:53] <Worldbrand> I mean shadow raiders was hmmm
[2:27:09] <mistermastergreg> the toys weren't even accurate
[2:27:10] <%SchroedingersFerret> That was weird. Startscream was a good guy but still had an evil snake voice.
[2:27:15] <+PenmanLupine> Beast Machines is the Devil May Cry 2 of the franchise
[2:27:17] <weapon000> I love exo-squad
[2:27:23] <+ThatGuyfromMars> Yeah he was an autobot to spite megatron, he came back to the decepticons but this version of starscream was a little more noble, he sacrifices himself to unicron in the most badass way
[2:27:26] <RetributionP> watch beast machines on stream
[2:27:29] <mistermastergreg> the beast machines toys SUCKED
[2:27:29] <+TendrilsTwitch> paige plays transformers war for cybertron when
[2:27:30] <Logan_Jennings1> >_> I only had the toy of that Bat guy so I have no attachment to any of these things.
[2:27:33] <%konekoryugamine> Wow
[2:27:35] <Tuskor13> modern transformers toys are all dogshit you just push a button and they transform. make me WORK for that shit
[2:27:35] <%konekoryugamine> Jsut wow
[2:27:39] <arcaderabbit48> Pretty sure when making Beast Machines, they were explicitly told to NOT WATCH Beast Wars for some reason
[2:27:42] <bambowl> and then it killed your soul
[2:27:46] <$Dutchpotato> Oh man that’s rough
[2:27:47] <Pulsin> theres gonna be a transformers TCG in a few months
[2:27:50] <%konekoryugamine> NO
[2:27:56] <ToneBacas> what about Bionicle?
[2:28:03] <Gerik1233> beast wars looks ugly as fuck
[2:28:05] <+Skatedeandre> Was there a pterodactyl autobot/decepticon
[2:28:06] <$OdysseyKnight> and this emotion was never surpassed until the first date with Pat
[2:28:07] <+JenovasPuppet> Beast Machines is sooooo bad. Like every time I look more into it it somehow becomes even worse.
[2:28:11] <dildozerfred> NERD
[2:28:12] <+zaibatsu_member_333> I came here to eat an laugh at gingers play Vidja games like Garbalage
[2:28:12] <StrawberryPantsu> I dont remember that much
[2:28:14] <Jmann1892> Bring Back Optimal Optimus
[2:28:15] <%konekoryugamine> My parents LEGIT told me I could not get Bionicle toys because they were FOR BOYS.
[2:28:15] <StrawberryPantsu> I was like 5
[2:28:16] <+QueenEmmaTE> MacDorgins
[2:28:17] <zal_silverfang> Man Bionicle was wild
[2:28:23] <%Cynful_Pleasures> The first piece of media you recognize sucked ass is a powerful moment
[2:28:23] <+zaibatsu_member_333> onlyafroC
[2:28:27] <Luesagna00> @peachsaliva silly paige, forums didn't exist when you were 11 CoolStoryBob
[2:28:28] <Zeikier> there has been nothing worse in human history than mid-stage CG animation
[2:28:41] <arcaderabbit48> @Tuskor13 Counterpoint, I broke some of my toys when I was a kid because they were so poorly designed and didn't fit together well. So I'd rather have automatic shit, than deal with things I could not transform
[2:28:42] <Zeikier> like, not the early stages, but mid stage when they try being more detailed or some weird shit
[2:28:44] <Tooniearcade> Yup
[2:28:46] <+xROCKS7AR> dinobot is waifu
[2:28:47] <+zaibatsu_member_333> I hated Beat mashines tooo
[2:28:48] <%maskedriderhero> I didn't watch Transformers, I watched Power Rangers, Super Human Samurai Syber Squad and Beetleborgs
[2:28:49] <+ThatGuyfromMars> How does paige feel about that bumblebbe movie or the live action films in general
[2:28:54] <+NWR_James> Don't transform shame him!
[2:28:56] <+zaibatsu_member_333> = _=)
[2:29:00] <TikanZK> Is Unicorn a cool dude? I know absolutely nothing about transformers but i had his toy
[2:29:03] <%TrevyWeaponsGuy> YOU WANT CHEETOR
[2:29:05] <Twoiis> I liked the Thrust red harring.
[2:29:06] <+Fairy_princess77> Paige sounds like every Transformers Forum Neckbeard for the last 20 years.
[2:29:07] <%konekoryugamine> I . . . reluctantly watched the FoxBox as a kid
[2:29:18] <+zaibatsu_member_333> >:D
[2:29:20] <+PenmanLupine> Rodimus Prime was awesome when it was Judd Nelson voicing him
[2:29:25] <zal_silverfang> @TikanZK quite the opposite. he was the, literal, BIGGEST asshole
[2:29:30] <+ThatGuyfromMars> @tikanzk nah he was a son of a bitch. Orson wells voiced him in the 86 movie
[2:29:32] <+Skatedeandre> Yeah I hated rodimus prime
[2:29:35] <TikanZK> @zal_silverfang fucking sick
[2:29:35] <Jmann1892> Here's a list of good Primes: Optimus there
[2:29:39] <+zaibatsu_member_333> What about Rhino?
[2:29:53] <Pulsin> Rhino my fav transformers of all
[2:29:54] <outis94> rodimus is cool if hes not the main character
[2:30:03] <+zaibatsu_member_333> Rhino seems like he played the part he would in best machines
[2:30:10] <%konekoryugamine> OH DAMN
[2:30:12] <%konekoryugamine> XD
[2:30:14] <%maskedriderhero> robots making out
[2:30:14] <Zeikier> SAUCY
[2:30:15] <Prevot> fuck fighting
[2:30:16] <+ThatGuyfromMars> Rodimus was an asshole in energon
[2:30:17] <%TrevyWeaponsGuy> This sounds like Star Trek bullshit
[2:30:17] <%Remery_> this is a cartoon?
[2:30:21] <bambowl> og fuck fighting
[2:30:23] <+zaibatsu_member_333> ROBOTS MAKIN OUT!
[2:30:27] <%konekoryugamine> That does sound like some Star Trek shit!
[2:30:28] <+Skatedeandre> What the fuck
[2:30:30] <zal_silverfang> @TikanZK he was planet sized. he transformed into a planet (which you likely already know), and ATE PLANETS. he was basically robo Galactis
[2:30:32] <$Dutchpotato> Sounds hot
[2:30:33] <+LegendCobra> are we eating socially here?
[2:30:50] <SubjectX07x> So it was pg devilman crybaby fuckfight scene
[2:30:52] <arcaderabbit48> Didnt Silverbolt turn in to an ugly peacock later?
[2:30:55] <+zaibatsu_member_333> What palnet were they on?
[2:30:55] <$Dutchpotato> Just run away like big heroes
[2:30:57] <+DuffMacwhalen> what the fuck paige is on her fourth burger
[2:31:02] <Superblooms> question: which series had Minicons?
[2:31:04] <+DuffMacwhalen> HOW MANY DID YOU BUY
[2:31:12] <42nfl19> I had the 4 hybrid toys that I thought were the shit. Eagle/Wolf, Elephant/Whale, Dragonfly/Lizard, and Pirhana/Wasp.
[2:31:17] <%TrevyWeaponsGuy> Paige need beef
[2:31:17] <%Aztec50> im glad i came back to this after getting takeout
[2:31:18] <$Agami23> robots in disguise had minicons i think
[2:31:19] <$TheSniperJoe> cheer1000 I just spent three hours, prepping, cooking, and serving cast iron cooked tomahawk ribeyes... And that McDonalds is uncomfortably appealing right now. This must be the Paige effect.
[2:31:24] <+ThatGuyfromMars> @superblooms armada
[2:31:24] <%konekoryugamine> Oh dang which season did have the Minicons? It's been way too long
[2:31:24] <42nfl19> I had the toys way before seeing the show
[2:31:24] <%Fedgle> mcdonalds is not good
[2:31:29] <$Dutchpotato> HxH does run away the enemy is too powerful well but I see how that would be bad
[2:31:30] <%maskedriderhero> i remember that one animated show
[2:31:38] <TikanZK> @zal_silverfang yeah I thought he was super cool, but my mom threw him out rip
[2:31:38] <$OdysseyKnight> Time to kill some characters because you didn't love them enough to buy their toys
[2:31:41] <%maskedriderhero> Where in a late season, Starscream becomes an Autobot
[2:31:43] <+PenmanLupine> man I loved Silverbolts toy because fuck yeah wolf transformer but god he was such a pussy sometimes
[2:31:45] <Jmann1892> Dinobot was the best
[2:31:47] <Zeikier> Rhinox was voiced by Punch Out's Bear Hugger
[2:31:47] <%GoCoSpace> Only mcdonalds beef may sustain paige's girth
[2:31:48] <%TenderBabyBacon> she just needs the meat in her mouth
[2:31:49] <Superblooms> that was the first transformers show i ever saw.
[2:31:51] <+gralho> Dragon Ball Z Abridged: Episode 60 - Part 2 is out!!!!
[2:32:07] <+Skatedeandre> No talk more moon2A
[2:32:07] <zal_silverfang> yes paige. let the anger flow
[2:32:08] <eyelessstrider> wou
[2:32:16] <+ThatGuyfromMars> Airrazor was dtf
[2:32:17] <$GohanEgret> he gets drake'd
[2:32:18] <outis94> what was the fuzor that died in the last few episode?
[2:32:23] <Cloudy_TV> moon2T
[2:32:27] <+LumberjackJack> I'm the same about Mass Effect. I run my mouth because I loved it, but it ultimately eats me up D:
[2:32:27] <MyDarkStorm> @PeachSaliva Weird part that Optimus Primal finds Optimus Prime
[2:32:28] <%TenderBabyBacon> @gralho and its amazing
[2:32:32] <Zeikier> rat TRAPPED in a wheelchair
[2:32:32] <+Skatedeandre> OH I REMEMBER RAT TRAP
[2:32:42] <+DuffMacwhalen> it was that crazy energon apocalypse thing
[2:32:46] <eyelessstrider> @peachsaliva would you get beast wars toys now since you can?
[2:32:49] <zal_silverfang> yeah. how does a robot become handicapped???
[2:32:50] <+TendrilsTwitch> handicap because he was too dumb to make new legs even though theyre giant robots
[2:32:51] <+DuffMacwhalen> Rhinox somehow avoided it though
[2:32:56] <$Dutchpotato> Aren’t they all on wheels tho?
[2:33:08] <%TrevyWeaponsGuy> Just fucking mod yourself
[2:33:08] <arcaderabbit48> Didn't Rhinox become a huge asshole villain too?
[2:33:09] <Worldbrand> he's mad because he's short
[2:33:10] <ToneBacas> Paige can't wrap her head around the paraplegic robot
[2:33:12] <bambowl> how can a robot be crippled
[2:33:12] <%konekoryugamine> wha
[2:33:13] <%Aztec50> but he's always on wheels?
[2:33:18] <energywarning> i thought he was angry because he had no weapons? because he has that tail hacking thing
[2:33:18] <Supathief> Is Paige wearing the baller ass boots?
[2:33:22] <%konekoryugamine> Rat Trap?
[2:33:29] <ToneBacas> oh shit
[2:33:30] <%konekoryugamine> That's the name they went with.
[2:33:31] <zal_silverfang> "vaguely"
[2:33:31] <outis94> rhinox did become a vilan tank guy
[2:33:32] <Tracazoid> I assume Rattrap would have been a car of some sort back on cybertron prior to the Beast Wars thing anyway so it is rather odd.
[2:33:35] <%konekoryugamine> "Rat trap".
[2:33:36] <+DuffMacwhalen> robots can totally be handicapped. fuckin' transmutate.
[2:33:42] <+SenorCounter> Did Pat get ribs?
[2:33:43] <$Dutchpotato> Like wakka
[2:33:45] <Luesagna00> @peachsaliva always hated his weel design. i though they are always in like jungle terrane
[2:33:51] <%konekoryugamine> I think he got wings.
[2:33:58] <+PenmanLupine> pats got Chicken wings
[2:33:59] <+ShogunNoonto> he has wheels before wheels were invented
[2:34:05] <+DuffMacwhalen> There was literally an episode on beast wars about a retarded transformer named tramsmutate.
[2:34:10] <Storm_Samurai> Seriously did they just add transmetals to show off their new reflection tech?
[2:34:17] <+ThatGuyfromMars> I remember the predacons and decepticons both appearing in robots in disguise and was utterly confused
[2:34:20] <+SenorCounter> Damn now i want ribs or Buffalo wings
[2:34:23] <+DuffMacwhalen> and it turned out to be one of the most powerful robots
[2:34:25] <arcaderabbit48> @DuffMacwhalen I thought he was supposed to be a baby?
[2:34:27] <+DuffMacwhalen> it was dumb
[2:34:27] <Tooniearcade> They make rat trap so whiny and such a screw up when he was such a bad ass in Beast Wars
[2:34:29] <%konekoryugamine> Cliche number 5: Villain convinces the hero's friend they can fix something about them or their lives and make them turn heel
[2:34:38] <%Gogogolem> @PeachSaliva So interesting fact the whole reason Megatron started the cybertron war its because Optimus prime wants to keep a really strict caste system in place where megatron would be forced to mine his entire life without seeing the sky.
[2:34:42] <+JenovasPuppet> Wow, racist
[2:34:58] <mayorrev> is that a maple leaf on that mcdonalds cup?
[2:35:05] <+loukemia83> She was a Maximal with Predacon programming
[2:35:07] <+Fairy_princess77> I only collect the toys for a reason.
[2:35:10] <%konekoryugamine> Oh god then that DOES mean it's Optimus Christ versus Mega Devil!
[2:35:12] <+JenovasPuppet> Rinox ;_;
[2:35:15] <AggsMK7> I was so pissed. Rhinox was my favorite
[2:35:28] <$OdysseyKnight> Are your souls weighed down by energon?
[2:35:28] <+PenmanLupine> god Rhinox got it bad
[2:35:37] <%konekoryugamine> What happened to Rhinox?
[2:35:37] <+JenovasPuppet> I thought Waspinator got left on Earth?
[2:35:42] <+DuffMacwhalen> I love Clue
[2:35:49] <Storm_Samurai> srsly tho what happened?
[2:35:51] <SinfulElation> @PeachSaliva Do you have a PhD in Beast Machines?

[2:37:27] <+ThatGuyfromMars> @subjectx07x it shares the same continuity of the games
[2:37:28] <AncelDeLambert> gonna make Plague suffer, eh?
[2:37:32] <LiquidMathew> I only remember who they actually are, not their vehicle names

[2:37:42] <MyDarkStorm> He's discount Starscream
[2:37:45] <+DuffMacwhalen> Paige has commited all of this shit to fucking memory.
[2:37:46] <LiquidMathew> Rattrap can hack
[2:37:47] <%konekoryugamine> I LOOKED UP A PICTURE OF RHINOX AND THE LEGIT FIRST THING I THINK OF IS PAT'S FACE! XD
[2:37:49] <LiquidMathew> tail is cord
[2:37:49] <%konekoryugamine> RHINOX IS PAT
[2:37:51] <zal_silverfang> @Dingalow yes
[2:37:53] <+JenovasPuppet> LUL
[2:38:02] <derap41> People already have
[2:38:07] <%TrevyWeaponsGuy> Yeah no, that's just Pat
[2:38:16] <+ThatGuyfromMars> @mydarkstorm man he so is. His toys were just repaints of starscream
[2:38:17] <+tgutierrez135> dam i could use some mcdonalds right now
[2:38:19] <+ThatRandomGuy661> What are your thoughts on the movie for G1?
[2:38:20] <puhff> BUT PAIGE YOURE ILLITERATE
[2:38:22] <derap41> ***
[2:38:29] <leinadtonu> How do you remember all this?
[2:38:39] <derap41> Its only 80$
[2:38:39] <%SchroedingersFerret> @PeachSaliva Write Beastwars fanfiction and read it on stream.
[2:38:40] <TerraWraith> Oh my god, he's a Bikie Man from a Bikie Gang
[2:38:41] <%TrevyWeaponsGuy> Waspinator just flew there
[2:38:44] <+loukemia83> Thrust was waspinator
[2:38:45] <%TrevyWeaponsGuy> He's waspinator
[2:38:45] <$Dutchpotato> When’s the Paige video essay on beast machines
[2:38:45] <+JenovasPuppet> What the fuck?
[2:38:46] <energywarning> spoilers don't matter for trash
[2:38:47] <%maskedriderhero> why are vehicles fighting the animals
[2:38:48] <$Dutchpotato> What
[2:38:54] <+Skatedeandre> The older you get the better your memory is
[2:39:06] <bambowl> big grudges
[2:39:06] <%craig_t> @PeachSaliva i feel it, i get so invested in shows that dissapoint me
[2:39:07] <derap41> there a three fucking volumes of them
[2:39:18] <CrimsonGargoyle> this is like the shit ratchet and clank reboot did to us fans of the series LUL sympathy go UP
[2:39:24] <Logan_Jennings1> Wait that toy I had was some Bat version of Optimus? Wtf
[2:39:25] <ArtThouBored> Oh yeah true hatred sticks around more
[2:39:25] <AggsMK7> Dead on Waspinator
[2:39:28] <Twoiis> Jetstream
[2:39:28] <%redstonej> you cant spoil garbage
[2:39:28] <%maskedriderhero> Is that why Pat is with you? Because he made you so angry you wanted him around forever?
[2:39:30] <ArtThouBored> Like the Mass Effect 3
[2:39:31] <+DuffMacwhalen> Notscream.
[2:39:39] <LiquidMathew> Apparently storywise, Waspinator just got bored of being a god and left to go back to Cybertron
[2:39:40] <+ThatGuyfromMars> Thrust I think is one of the main villians in the bumblebee movie
[2:39:42] <+JenovasPuppet> Silverbolt is such a nerd
[2:39:46] <%konekoryugamine> Yeah Rhinox IS Pat
[2:39:50] <MyDarkStorm> why Dont you play transformers game from High Moon?
[2:39:52] <Luesagna00> @peachsaliva Peach is a HIPPO confirmed, she gets angry and holds perfect memory grudges forever!
[2:39:53] <$Dutchpotato> Sounds lame
[2:39:59] <+DuffMacwhalen> Silverbolt totally says 'milady' doesn't he
[2:40:00] <%konekoryugamine> I have never laughed this hard since I found out Takahata is essentially Itachi
[2:40:02] <Twoiis> I actually enjoyed that twist.
[2:40:04] <zal_silverfang> i can feel my soul cringing
[2:40:08] <LiquidMathew> Tankor reveal is first I believe
[2:40:17] <770megaman> Are you gonna play spider men?
[2:40:29] <Storm_Samurai> wait how are they in both bodies at the same time?
[2:40:31] <AncelDeLambert> There is only Jetstream Sam, no other Jetstream
[2:40:37] <AggsMK7> They pulled a Dark Beast with him
[2:40:41] <%cyberblade507> This whole Transformers rant is entirely my fault for asking who her favorite was and I love it.
[2:40:43] <+Diabetic> This is amazing.
[2:40:45] <%konekoryugamine> Because Dark is Not Evil
[2:40:50] <%konekoryugamine> Or TVTropes
[2:40:51] <SinfulElation> Yeah but how MANY spider tits tho?
[2:40:51] <+loukemia83> There was the episode of Wars where Megatron turns Rhinox into a Predacon with a ray gun, and Rhinox takes over
[2:40:51] <%krawtch> rhinox used to hang out in beast form and fart with animals
[2:40:53] <bambowl> character flips are the worst

[2:50:42] <arcaderabbit48> Rhinox was relaly cool, why did he become a villain?
[2:50:43] <Twoiis> She was a boy in the japanese version I believe.

[2:50:58] <+Diabetic> fuck yeah he does
[2:50:59] <%konekoryugamine> DONATIONS AND BIIIIIIIITTTTTSSSSSS
[2:50:59] <%cyberblade507> Also, the first Airazor toy was originally going to be a guy.
[2:51:03] <+PenmanLupine> cause he became a Transmetal 2. All Transmetal 2s were garbage
[2:51:07] <papanail> yessss paige is streaming
[2:51:09] <+SirG005E> wait cheetor is a trap?
[2:51:10] <%TrevyWeaponsGuy> YEAH HE LOOKS GREAT
[2:51:12] <+Nedlin> Cheetor post-puberty looks too messy
[2:51:13] <%konekoryugamine> Can't be that ba - OH MY GOD THAT'S BAD
[2:51:18] <%maskedriderhero> @PeachSaliva Did you ever watch Zoids? Giant CGI robot animals seems to be in your line of interest
[2:51:20] <+Grayhammatter> that's SUPER bad
[2:51:21] <+ThatGuyfromMars> And then they gave her boobs on her transmetal toy
[2:51:23] <+SirG005E> trapformers?
[2:51:24] <%TrevyWeaponsGuy> He looks like Incineroar
[2:51:26] <LiquidMathew> Is that the one with really red eyes?
[2:51:26] <%TrevyWeaponsGuy> I love it
[2:51:31] <VirtuaRailith> @PeachSaliva Depthcharge's hateboner for Rampage was my favorite part of beast wars.
[2:51:31] <+redeq2> It’s RAD !!!
[2:51:31] <+PenmanLupine> even Dinobot 2 kinda looked like an overdesigned mess
[2:51:33] <leinadtonu> Paige loves talking about this, uh...?
[2:51:42] <zal_silverfang> JESUS
[2:51:46] <tearsaurther> Cybertron series
[2:51:48] <dawnengel> hey peach just wanna say thanks for keeping me sane with your streams :)
[2:51:54] <zamzoph> DID YOU SHIP DEPTHCHARGE AND RAMPAGE?
[2:51:54] <TheMilhouseExperience> Is that the one where Optimus got a hoverboard?
[2:51:57] <+SirG005E> Depthcharge was Star Scream right?
[2:52:00] <$actionhank87> The SBFP pins are still available....ORDERING NOW! @PeachSaliva
[2:52:02] <derap41> Have you seen the latest series of them going camping
[2:52:03] <Hydrapissed> Zoids was better paige
[2:52:04] <Hydrapissed> FITE me
[2:52:07] <PakuV2> Pre-Crisis Cheetor looks like yellow Cell
[2:52:08] <derap41> they masturbate in a tent
[2:52:09] <+Diabetic> I remember when this came on at 11:30 on Fox Kids
[2:52:10] <+loukemia83> Transmutate was the weirdest baby
[2:52:11] <+DuffMacwhalen> FLIGHT IS NO LONGER YOUR ADVANTAGE, OPTIMUS PRIMAL
[2:52:11] <%cyberblade507> Airazor's Transmetal toy was one of the first, I think, to actually be intended as a female character from the outset.
[2:52:11] <+PenmanLupine> @SirG005E no, he was a damaged protospark
[2:52:16] <QaizerArt> @PeachSaliva Please keep talking about it, I love your passion about it.
[2:52:23] <+junpei098> Is Pat a fan of TDS?
[2:52:29] <AggsMK7> Cheetor was a cheetah with a jet engine attached to it
[2:52:29] <+redeq2> Yep AND ITS RAD
[2:52:30] <MyDarkStorm> OH JUST LOOK AT IT
[2:52:31] <+DuffMacwhalen> T-Rex Megatron with fucking jet turbines
[2:52:36] <+ThatRandomGuy661> Beast wars was somehow the period of "early" transformers I completely missed
[2:52:37] <%krawtch> in Canada it was called Beasties, I would assume because the broadcasting authority didn't want WAR to be in a kids show title
[2:52:37] <+Superstarsage> Nah i was just late
[2:52:37] <hntronium> I see that Beast Wars is why Paige is a furry
[2:52:42] <%stovetopism> Man I wish I was this passionate about a nerd thing, instead i remember dumb bullshit about everything
[2:52:42] <Worldbrand> because it's beast wars
[2:52:48] <%generalve> LUL LUL LUL
[2:52:49] <derap41> Must the the koreans
[2:52:50] <Hydrapissed> girl eating food = more viewers pat
[2:52:50] <Dr_Donkey_Brains> You aren't eating you frauds
[2:52:50] <+SirG005E> @PenmanLupine ahhhh. idk why I always thought that. Maybe the traitor flipflop nature of Depthcharge?
[2:52:51] <zal_silverfang> what about that Atlantis one? where Atlantis is a Cybertron ship or some shit?
[2:52:52] <%TrevyWeaponsGuy> Furry cybertronian dick convention
[2:52:54] <+JenovasPuppet> Video games are for losers! I'm gonna watch people eat!
[2:52:54] <Hydrapissed> whats there to think about
[2:52:56] <%Remery_> Because Paige is showing the world her Nerd Boner!
[2:53:01] <Gates623> @peachsaliva what do you think about Inferno
[2:53:04] <+cereal_box_conspiracy> Social Eating is a game, though. I thought that's what you were gonna play.
[2:53:04] <Kaitepaints> Because I love McDonald’s
[2:53:06] <MyDarkStorm> Play the GAME
[2:53:08] <%generalve> Get that grease all over your 1500 dollar laptop Kappa
[2:53:09] <zamzoph> I don't remember transmetal 2 blacknaihoifaehwogiia at all
[2:53:11] <+ThatGuyfromMars> @cyberblade507 first to be released, yeah. Arcee was gonna have it in 86 but was canned
[2:53:15] <%Typhaeon> ROG laptop? Not a Predator Triton, bad sponsor man Kappa
[2:53:18] <LiquidMathew> I remember Beast Wars was called Beasties in Canada for some reason, us Canadians are weird
[2:53:21] <PakuV2> oh WOW
[2:53:22] <%Remery_> Nice
[2:53:22] <Kaitepaints> Pull it up
[2:53:25] <+SirG005E> giant tit inspiration
[2:53:27] <NotSoAccurateNo1> that's the best part
[2:53:29] <QaizerArt> I can't believe that Paige is Blackarachnia
[2:53:29] <+SirG005E> named hitomi?
[2:53:31] <bambowl> McDonald's?
[2:53:31] <derap41> fucking product placements!
[2:53:34] <ProRJHunter> She's right
[2:53:35] <+Diabetic> ...what
[2:53:37] <Hydrapissed> stripper = black arachnia
[2:53:37] <+FadingEmber> @PeachSaliva I mean this unironically, please start a podcast
[2:53:37] <%TrevyWeaponsGuy> Perfect
[2:53:50] <zal_silverfang> very terrible
[2:53:50] <+ThatGuyfromMars> Nice
[2:53:53] <%stovetopism> Like extreme dinosaurs and Galdor. Why the fuck do I remember galdor?!
[2:53:55] <Huntercd> What about thongs?
[2:53:57] <arcaderabbit48> Oh my god the transmetals really do look nterrible
[2:53:59] <PakuV2> Beast wars made furries
[2:53:59] <+SirG005E> feels like a plague design
[2:54:00] <NotSoAccurateNo1> Sounds like something I would do
[2:54:01] <Twoiis> Mainframe Studios used to conduct hiring interviews at a nearby Stripclub.

[3:04:44] <+JenovasPuppet> I was mislead!
[3:04:45] <papanail> yaoi is harcore
[3:04:46] <StarlightGalactic> Yuri on Ice is pretty much shonen ai
[3:04:47] <MyDarkStorm> Shounen ai is lebain

[3:04:48] <%Ciphris> yaoi is DUDES BEING GAY
[3:04:51] <+SodiusChubz> like Gravitation
[3:04:51] <%Aztec50> Paige should watch Down the Rabbit Hole then. that series is great for web shenanigans.

[3:05:06] <$MagickBurritoh> naruto had a gay kiss
[3:05:07] <%umbypokochan> yaoi is gay stuff made for girls mostly, bara is gay stuff by gay men for gay men
[3:05:07] <zamzoph> but Naruto's pretty gay tho
[3:05:07] <PakuV2> Lemon Yaoi is HARD Hardcore, Lime Yaoi is Hardcore Lite

[3:05:16] <$Agami23> naruto had a gay moment right away. then never again
[3:05:24] <+JenovasPuppet> Naruto did way more for Sasuke's sake than his wife.
[3:05:24] <rytisone> Gun to your head: Is Naruto gay?

[3:10:49] <%konekoryugamine> Like, I BURIED myself in Kingdom Hearts Yaoi before I learned it wa sa whole GENRE
[3:10:52] <TheSniperJoe> Yeah it did it to me with Pat.
[3:10:56] <TheSniperJoe> :
[3:10:59] <%alliedmastercompy> Yeah, that one month break broke my streak, no worries though
[3:11:06] <%DuffMacwhalen> @PeachSaliva Pat are you enjoying Spider-Man? I like it but i'm feeling the monotony of it.
[3:11:08] <+simpo98> What are they called again in Beast Wars Maximos and Predacons ? @peachsaliva
[3:11:26] <+OmegaWeltall> I-Is she touching his balls?!
[3:11:30] <zamzoph> I want Portal Paige FeelsBadMan
[3:11:40] <arcaderabbit48> Honestly, Kingdom Hearts isn't the worst place to start with that.
[3:11:41] <energywarning> paige succed pat's health
[3:11:44] <$Agami23> so always??
[3:11:45] <Psyramics> Paige is a vampire, stealing all of Pat's vitality
[3:11:48] <%umbypokochan> oh.... my body....

[3:11:57] <Prevot> LUL pat
[3:12:00] <%Doctor_Death_Bed> oh man my grandmother actually has sundowner syndrome, that shits rough
[3:12:01] <$MagickBurritoh> cheer500 Hey, given Paige will never play DD, might I suggest a game called Rain World to play on stream, it's a physics platformer survival game where you play as an omnivourous slugcat
[3:12:01] <%Remery_> Keep asking
[3:12:09] <NotSoAccurateNo1> what the fuck, ask them why
[3:12:13] <%Mr_y1096> sipsipRude
[3:12:19] <%umbypokochan> sipsipRude
[3:12:23] <bambowl> for the knolage
[3:12:28] <Bouldus> why would you ask a dev questions about the game they devd?
[3:12:30] <zamzoph> RUDE!
[3:12:32] <%DuffMacwhalen> sipsipRude sipsipRude
[3:12:32] <leinadtonu> wait, asking questions is rude?
[3:12:33] <%Remery_> Is the question lewd?
[3:12:35] <Bouldus> thats the person youi ask
[3:12:36] <TheMilhouseExperience> But how will he learn?
[3:12:56] <+SergeEXE> She didn't reverse!
[3:12:59] <%konekoryugamine> cheer200 I'm just being nice today, and I just wanted to send condolences for Pat being sick. Also wanted to ask what my favorite ginger chucklefucks thought was the WORST, and I do say WORST, anime they have ever seen. You can't say anything SAO related, or anything Transformers related.
[3:13:01] <SuperNotSuspiciousMan> "I don't want to lose my job stop asking"
[3:13:03] <SgtSmilies> lol pestering people with questions is definitely rude
[3:13:03] <NotSoAccurateNo1> If they're under some NDA, can't they just say they're under an NDA?
[3:13:06] <%krawtch> hiss isn't in asterisks so he's actually just saying hiss
[3:13:08] <PakuV2> peech hates knowledge

[3:13:21] <%umbypokochan> you didn't reverse your rows before teh battle
[3:13:22] <sparrrow_> Pat Naruto cosplay when?
[3:13:24] <%umbypokochan> you are not pro
[3:13:24] <%DuffMacwhalen> oh god
[3:13:27] <%DuffMacwhalen> OH GOD
[3:13:29] <%konekoryugamine> Huh, that's a pretty god track

[3:13:36] <+AmaniIsYourBoss> Woof. That's a big woof.
[3:13:38] <ToneBacas> LUL
[3:13:41] <RurouniGeo> some NDAs say you cant tell people you are under NDA
[3:13:42] <cherubsanonymous> Never forget
[3:13:43] <%Hilleltaco> god pat don't bring us back to that
[3:13:44] <leinadtonu> That's awesome!
[3:13:50] <%Hilleltaco> i can't handle it
[3:13:51] <arcaderabbit48> @NotSoAccurateNo1 Ironically, it depends on the NDA. Because yes, some include the very existence of the NDA to be part of the NDA
[3:13:51] <NotSoAccurateNo1> damn, you got me
[3:13:54] <ToneBacas> Paige needs swirly glasses
[3:14:04] <%DuffMacwhalen> BEAST WARS IS REAL

[3:41:10] <%SuperCasualBoom> Cure2: Electric Bugaloo

[3:41:34] <%bloodypurpledog> What are you going to call Pat's shit baby
[3:41:39] <leinadtonu> Poopy kisses and beast wars... Podcast name.
[3:41:50] <puhff> Wtf y ether so high???
[3:41:56] <frogurtz> Its harder than the og.
[3:41:59] <%AbnormalVoid> DS version has much better gameplay
[3:42:00] <+simpo98> tbh the PSP is the best and most complete version
[3:42:01] <Dragonfang1337> Wasn't there a sequel to ff4 that took place years after?
[3:42:02] <$OdysseyKnight> The DS version is vengeful in difficulty
[3:42:02] <QaizerArt> Paige who is your more favorite girl from FF4, Rosa or Rydia?
[3:42:04] <%umbypokochan> play it on the HD version of DesMuMe
[3:42:06] <%SuperCasualBoom> @justinianknight Play the GBA version. You can bring the characters from past to the final boss
[3:42:07] <$nademonkey1100> how the fuck do they carry a cabin around
[3:42:09] <%cyberblade507> Would you like to see Rattrap play Starscream TO Starscream? It totally happens in the IDW comics.
[3:42:12] <$Kain5707> its broken hard
[3:42:14] <Luesagna00> @peachsaliva uhhh paige ya know we can actually hear pat in the bathroom... its audible
[3:42:25] <+AntithesisEK> oops Cronos, god of time replaced my brain with a cabbage.
[3:42:33] <%NotBryson> Pat is playing us the butt trombone solo
[3:42:35] <demonhunter790> “Starting to” Paige I have some bad news for you
[3:42:37] <+simpo98> PSP > DS version :P
[3:42:48] <+ThatRandomGuy661> What about the GBA/PSP version?
[3:42:48] <Eresus> yes
[3:42:48] <%DuffMacwhalen> no way
[3:42:48] <Risingxiv> PSP version is the best
[3:42:49] <frogurtz> Sucks we never got a FF5 + FF6 DS version.
[3:42:49] <QaizerArt> Paige, if you had to be drawn as one or the other, Rydia or Rosa?
[3:42:50] <Hydrapissed> HELL yeah
[3:42:51] <%Remery_> yes
[3:42:53] <SatansDick1> ye
[3:42:57] <MrCowKing> @PeachSaliva you're the cutest autistic couple I've ever seen
[3:43:02] <+StreamingAniki> I don't like the enemy level scaling in the ds version
[3:43:07] <%krawtch> i thought i heard a butt sound and now i am super closely listening for butt sounds
[3:43:10] <%bloodypurpledog> It sounds like when sonic drowns
[3:43:11] <Hydrapissed> autismos
[3:43:12] <derap41> Domestic
[3:43:14] <Risingxiv> DS is hardest and ugliest
[3:43:16] <Prevot> you're using the poop mic
[3:43:31] <jhp209> oh man I'm five pints of cider in I'm catching like half of every thing going on
[3:43:32] <%SuperCasualBoom> Watching Edward go weak to stable in leveling in FFIV GBA is hilariously awesome
[3:43:35] <NotSoAccurateNo1> take us off ch2
[3:43:36] <QaizerArt> Then pay attention to twitter!
[3:43:44] <weapon000> Rydia is best girl
[3:43:49] <+AntithesisEK> rydia's eventual outfit is pretty intense stuff
[3:43:50] <$OdysseyKnight> I see stink lines wafting in from off camera
[3:44:02] <AncelDeLambert> draw her as child Rydia!
[3:44:03] <%Typhaeon> Speaking of butt sounds, Twitter
[3:44:03] <+simpo98> PSP has FFIV Prelude FFIV and FFIV the After Years :) @PeachSaliva
[3:44:15] <+StreamingAniki> IMO making enemies scale to your level is a sin for turn based rpgs
[3:44:20] <%umbypokochan> i always hated this part
[3:44:20] <suhmguy> CoolStoryBob
[3:44:25] <Luesagna00> @peachsaliva first his pissing sounds now pooooping. that's gon be a clip
[3:44:29] <%umbypokochan> so cheesey
[3:44:31] <fussyphuk> hes prob holding a roll of tp right now
[3:44:38] <%Typhaeon> Please spare us the shit clip
[3:44:42] <%SuperCasualBoom> FFIV after years...what a horrible sequel. Like Disney DVD sequel horrible
[3:44:42] <demonhunter790> Born from a dragon you say?
[3:44:43] <%krawtch> making enemies give zero xp is a cardinal sin for turn based rpgs PAPER MARIOOOOOO
[3:44:44] <+BringBackSempai> this shit never made any sense to me
[3:44:50] <%AbnormalVoid> It means the light is your dad, idiot
[3:45:06] <weapon000> This game is why i love paladins
[3:45:08] <QaizerArt> Paige, if you like Rydia, would you like to see a shark I drew in Rydia's outfit that I am very genuinely sure is my favorite drawing?
[3:45:11] <arcaderabbit48> @krawtch Why did you remind me that Sticker Star exists?
[3:45:22] <%AbnormalVoid> I'm calling cecil an idiot, in case that wasn't clear lol
[3:45:25] <derap41> Targaryens?
[3:45:40] <leinadtonu> fus roh da?
[3:45:44] <%umbypokochan> i thought she said "shart"
[3:45:44] <@JustinianKnight> totally not Meteor
[3:45:48] <%krawtch> @arcaderabbit48 if i had to be reminded that rhinox had a whole episode of farting beans, everyone must feel a dark pain of some kind as well
[3:45:52] <+jK00215> why are 3 boulders following cecil?
[3:45:54] <+BringBackSempai> this is some Krypton shit
[3:45:58] <%AbnormalVoid> Gomez
[3:46:01] <+VideoVillain20> YES Hi Paige
[3:46:07] <%SuperCasualBoom> Fun Fact: Rydia learns Meteo at Lv 63
[3:46:09] <arcaderabbit48> @krawtch You know what? That's fair.
[3:46:09] <gloriusUMU> It's a' me, Meaty-o

[3:46:26] <+srkAres> basically thoughts and prayers
[3:46:27] <weapon000> Kain is best boy
[3:46:38] <+StreamingAniki> I have such fond memories of beating this game on an emulator during class in 5th grade
[3:46:43] <%AbnormalVoid> they get better Kappa
[3:46:43] <+BringBackSempai> was it this meteo or the one in 6 that hits everything on screen

[3:47:22] <+BringBackSempai> lies, only old people and girlfriends die in this game
[3:47:27] <%AbnormalVoid> SourPls
[3:47:32] <%umbypokochan> PRAISE THE SUN
[3:47:47] <%krawtch> must be HARD to talk about those kids so STONE faced
[3:47:49] <%SuperCasualBoom> @bringbacksempai and it was father and daughter. That bloodline is dead!
[3:47:54] <Luesagna00> were they headbanging?
[3:47:58] <$mister___doctor> You guys should stream the new Dragon Ball Abridged
[3:48:02] <%AbnormalVoid> Many people who should have died don't die
[3:48:03] <@JustinianKnight> the kids 'die' for a bit
[3:48:13] <%umbypokochan> only 1 person actually dies
[3:48:19] <%rdark_ksu> Liam and Woolie played it on the channel
[3:48:20] <+AntithesisEK> the elderly and girlfriends are paige's ideal prey
[3:48:22] <arcaderabbit48> Damn, the story wasn't that bad!
[3:48:22] <%umbypokochan> oh wait.. 2 people
[3:48:25] <EASrake> i would not say the story is Amazingly bad
[3:48:28] <+Blain_Cooper> Freedom Planet is a furry game
[3:48:30] <$Kain5707> oh you mean good sonic
[3:48:31] <+JenovasPuppet> "Better than Sonic Mania" not at all. It's okay, but it ain't no Sonic.
[3:48:39] <%umbypokochan> no, i'm wrong lol
[3:48:44] <$Metal_Slime_King> Freedom Planet was the best sonic game until Sonic Mania came out
[3:48:44] <%krawtch> better than sonic adventure yes. mania no.
[3:48:47] <Eresus> better sonic
[3:48:48] <demonhunter790> Didn’t Liam play Freedom Planet ?
[3:48:55] <+chowdah101> calling it better than mania is a hot take
[3:48:58] <@JustinianKnight> it is pretty good
[3:49:08] <leinadtonu> woolie and Liam loved it
[3:49:10] <+simpo98> im curious Paige did you play Rogue Galaxy on PS2 @PeachSaliva
[3:49:11] <NotSoAccurateNo1> freedom planet is only as furry as sonic
[3:49:17] <%Emperor_Derp> they played freedomplante on the channel
[3:49:17] <mistermastergreg> Pat is dead, TIME TO PARTY
[3:49:17] <+StreamingAniki> @peachsaliva is this your favorite snes FF game?
[3:49:39] <$Arazien> Rogue Galaxy is the shit!
[3:49:43] <%Typhaeon> Did you not like 6 as much?
[3:49:45] <%SuperCasualBoom> You’ll gonna find some hilarious finds.
[3:49:46] <+simpo98> aye :P
[3:49:55] <%umbypokochan> @PeachSaliva have you ever played a Saga game? (Saga Frontier / Romancing Saga / Final Fantasy Legend)
[3:49:56] <%DuffMacwhalen> @PeachSaliva Have you gotten a Fatal Cutie hat?
[3:49:59] <+StreamingAniki> It was my first too!!!!
[3:50:00] <@JustinianKnight> I only wish the story/world was more fleshed out
[3:50:01] <+AntithesisEK> the formative FF
[3:50:04] <+simpo98> FFIV and FFVI are my favourites
[3:50:06] <QaizerArt> @PeachSaliva What're your thoughts on FF6 though? Terra and Celes them girls tho!
[3:50:07] <RustyQuarters> So the real question is, is Edge a pedophile for wanting Rydia?
[3:50:17] <+HajimenoStream> nope time warp]
[3:50:20] <%SuperCasualBoom> Edge is R Kelly confirmed
[3:50:21] <+BringBackSempai> this was the first RPG I played that actually looked and sounded amazing (for 1992)
[3:50:24] <Intolerable> !uptime
[3:50:25] <%DuffMacwhalen> SOMEONE GET THIS GIRL A FATAL CUTIE HAT
[3:50:32] <+BringBackSempai> compared to FF1 that I played before

[3:51:02] <leinadtonu> agree
[3:51:11] <+Blain_Cooper> Gonna keep stream on in the background while I play FF 11
[3:51:12] <%Typhaeon> 9 got a lot of unwarranted hate when it came out
[3:51:16] <leinadtonu> I love 9 tho
[3:51:17] <+captain_history> so true
[3:51:17] <jhp209> @PeachSaliva whats a piece of media that is super important to you but almost no one else cares about?
[3:51:18] <+simpo98> FFIX is still awesome as well @PeachSaliva
[3:51:28] <+BringBackSempai> its really important to be able to grind RPG battles quickly
[3:51:30] <$mister___doctor> 7>6>9>Everyrhing else
[3:51:30] <@JustinianKnight> it's hard to have a wrong answer for this kinda thing tho
[3:51:30] <+th3madness> My boy shadow had a hard life
[3:51:34] <+BringBackSempai> its really hard to do that with 7's summons
[3:51:34] <+simpo98> Zidane best boy
[3:51:35] <%umbypokochan> get the item!
[3:51:37] <$Metal_Slime_King> cheer200 Did you ever find the Pink Tail in this game? The rarest item. I spent hours grinding for it and never got one.
[3:51:38] <@JustinianKnight> they're generally all very good
[3:51:41] <QaizerArt> 7's great! But I LOVE 6 so much more than any other FF game. It's story honestly hit a lot harder.
[3:51:45] <Dragonfang1337> he's alive
[3:51:45] <%umbypokochan> or did she get it and i wasn't paying attention?
[3:51:45] <arcaderabbit48> @jhp209 She just spent like 30 minutes talking about Beast Wars
[3:51:49] <Dragonfang1337> oh no
[3:51:54] <cherubsanonymous> Nothing will be better than 15 because it's not turn based :p
[3:51:56] <weapon000> do you go around the castle?
[3:51:56] <%SuperCasualBoom> 6 cast is everybody from different areas and races and class. X and after = everyone jpop drama cast of 7 people.

[3:56:11] <%Typhaeon> 14 is a slow start, but it really picks up when you get to the expansions
[3:56:17] <XyraFhoan> the game is super friendly to people who only play every so often
[3:56:20] <%Gogogolem> i'd love to watch you be bad at 14
[3:56:20] <%AbnormalVoid> nah don't it's bad Kappa
[3:56:24] <arcaderabbit48> It takes a long time for 14 to get good, unfortunately
[3:56:25] <@JustinianKnight> k
[3:56:27] <%SuperCasualBoom> Final Yawn 14
[3:56:32] <@JustinianKnight> it's really not too bad to catch up even
[3:56:33] <arcaderabbit48> But when it gets good, its really good
[3:56:42] <QaizerArt> @PeachSaliva If you are going to play 14, you better play it with that bald ass potato you love
[3:56:46] <mistermastergreg> Just ask Pat to grind it out for you
[3:56:48] <chocobodundee> what about Chrono Crosssss
[3:56:52] <+simpo98> Paige did you play FFXII ?
[3:57:01] <leinadtonu> MMOs require so much time...
[3:57:02] <arcaderabbit48> @QaizerArt Im not sure how much help PlagueofGripes would be for that game
[3:57:13] <+Blain_Cooper> 11 turned into a weird solo game now
[3:57:14] <%SuperCasualBoom> Innkeeper: Fuck the police!!! Sleep for free.
[3:57:26] <hypoid77> is pat STILL shitting?
[3:57:35] <%aslfrasle> @PeachSaliva You should totally play Warrior. Maximum Big and Strong
[3:57:38] <%krawtch> Pat shit himself into a sleep
[3:57:43] <leinadtonu> Pat's always shitting
[3:57:51] <%umbypokochan> the key was in his butt
[3:57:54] <hypoid77> lol
[3:57:55] <%AbnormalVoid> Pat Shidded and Farded
[3:57:58] <+JenovasPuppet> Reset the camera
[3:57:58] <+Endego> lol
[3:57:59] <pectusumbra> I mean it makes sense to give your mindslave a key in
[3:57:59] <%SuperCasualBoom> Baron Key joined the Party
[3:58:00] <QaizerArt> @arcaderabbit48 Sorry I meant the potato that shits in the bed
[3:58:04] <%Remery_> Shat so hard he passed out
[3:58:05] <+simpo98> i miss FFXIV i stopped playing after Heavensward
[3:58:15] <fussyphuk> pats prob taking a shower
[3:58:16] <mistermastergreg> Pat just absorbs everyone's shit
[3:58:21] <+simpo98> was a level 60 Black Mage
[3:58:27] <chocobodundee> well he is a toilet
[3:58:30] <Chaoko99> @simpo98 get back into it then.
[3:58:42] <%umbypokochan> it's weird how if you google umby pokochan one of the first things is my FFXIV character even though i haven't played in a long time... o.o
[3:58:45] <+simpo98> maybe some day @Chaoko99
[3:58:55] <Worldbrand> That game looked cute, but i dunno if it's much more than a side scrolling walking simulator
[3:59:18] <%krawtch> Pat is true chaotic for taking a shower earlier in the stream and then shitting
[3:59:22] <Chaoko99> It's probably to keep people from barging in and stealing shit.
[3:59:30] <Chaoko99> It's a weapon's store. Freaking knock.
[3:59:30] <legendarysabertooth> In that contextPat is the Liar Princess and Paige is the Blind Prince
[3:59:39] <+simpo98> not much time these days with work @Chaoko99
[3:59:40] <Worldbrand> Beautiful
[3:59:42] <%umbypokochan> go around the back and steal the chests
[3:59:49] <%umbypokochan> secret wall
[4:00:02] <%SuperCasualBoom> Paige, you’ll fine two claws in the cave you about to enter
[4:00:10] <demonhunter790> Oof
[4:00:28] <bambowl> scamed
[4:00:41] <%craig_t> @PeachSaliva i tried to play ffxiv, but to be honest i just sort of bounced off, and don't really know why, the gameplay was good, and the story wasn't that bad
[4:01:00] <@JustinianKnight> You can get Yang in Opera Omnia, kinda neat
[4:01:09] <@JustinianKnight> actually decent phone game
[4:01:35] <+simpo98> shame Yang never made it into Dissidia tho @JustinianKnight
[4:01:38] <%Typhaeon> He has that cool rattail, he'll be fine Kappa
[4:01:45] <%umbypokochan> go through the wall to steal chests behind counters
[4:01:49] <+simpo98> or Rydia :(
[4:01:59] <@JustinianKnight> yea Rydia woulda been good
[4:02:02] <@JustinianKnight> game needs more ladies
[4:02:11] <@JustinianKnight> Rinoa getting added was very cool tho
[4:02:12] <+zaibatsu_member_333> gah I'm back
[4:02:13] <mistermastergreg> steal their stuff and sell it back to them
[4:02:24] <+zaibatsu_member_333> ,_,)
[4:02:25] <+simpo98> NT got Rinoa recently @JustinianKnight
[4:02:30] <@JustinianKnight> yea
[4:02:36] <+zaibatsu_member_333> STEAL IT
[4:02:44] <+zaibatsu_member_333> THE MAKE A PROFIT
[4:02:52] <+zaibatsu_member_333> Then*
[4:03:00] <%umbypokochan> @PeachSaliva but really, you can take those chests, there's a secret passage if you walk through the right wall or something
[4:03:16] <StarlightGalactic> I got some mc d's to eat with paige
[4:03:18] <@JustinianKnight> big steal
[4:03:22] <+zaibatsu_member_333> woahh
[4:03:30] <bambowl> man i remember having a burning hatred for final fantasy because my brother never shut up about when we were kids.
[4:03:38] <@JustinianKnight> what a hero
[4:03:43] <%umbypokochan> yeyeyeyeyeye crimes
[4:03:44] <+simpo98> 2000 gold
[4:03:46] <+simpo98> :O
[4:03:52] <+tigerfang86> Cryme time with Paige
[4:03:54] <+tigerfang86> and Paige
[4:03:59] <%umbypokochan> acutally, some stuff in the cave is weak to ice
[4:04:17] <%krawtch> cecil is a paladin who holds up justice and the light but also THIEVES LIKE A BITCH
[4:04:20] <@JustinianKnight> oh hey
[4:04:21] <TheBlankAce> There is no point to not use two elements on yang the claws themselves have like no stats.
[4:04:22] <@JustinianKnight> thanks
[4:04:23] <+zaibatsu_member_333> Yay Normal Person Time! :D
[4:04:33] <$Kain5707> a mod should have a sub limesSmug
[4:04:37] <+zaibatsu_member_333> Not Garbalage Time onlyafroLove
[4:04:45] <demonhunter790> But I’m busy at normal people time!
[4:04:58] <Anonymasque> The mods now have ALL the power. We're doomed.
[4:04:59] <demonhunter790> Like a norm
[4:04:59] <+BringBackSempai> moon grinding was the worst
[4:05:17] <+simpo98> Final Fantasy Marathon when Paige :P @PeachSaliva
[4:05:24] <+BringBackSempai> I let a friend borrow this game, and he got all they way to the final boss then quit
[4:05:32] <Reanimator83> Get Pat to adjust the camera for you. If he still up.
[4:05:35] <+khalcipher> !uptime
[4:05:36] <+BringBackSempai> because of that last boss run
[4:05:41] <zamzoph> 8 LUL
[4:05:45] <@JustinianKnight> VIII is super good
[4:05:45] <+rei0> yay, 8
[4:05:46] <+Blain_Cooper> OH NO
[4:05:47] <%SuperCasualBoom> Paige, does Pat hate being Whiffle Pickle? I’ll stop if need be. Lol
[4:05:48] <$Trenr> oh god please no
[4:05:53] <+simpo98> Junction System tho is meh
[4:05:54] <$Arazien> Hell yeah 8!
[4:05:59] <%dawsfloss> woah no Pat its so quiet heh
[4:06:01] <%bloodypurpledog> Move Skelmo to the couch where he belongs
[4:06:02] <%umbypokochan> i once grinded to lv 99 in this game for no reason
[4:06:07] <+BringBackSempai> it was dealing with all the stuff on the way to the boss, he used up all his items
[4:06:14] <+Kongu_Bongu> Unless... you're playing the DS version.
[4:06:16] <+BringBackSempai> and didn't want to have to leave the final dungeon and return
[4:06:17] <dawnengel> my cat is chasing a fly
[4:06:18] <Anonymasque> I wanna see an FF8 revisit. I remembered finishing and liking the game but I was 14. That was a long time ago...
[4:06:27] <jacknerik> Anyone here play cities skylines? is base game +mass transit +after dark worth it for 20$
[4:06:31] <$Trenr> the game is such a cluster
[4:06:44] <+simpo98> yovgCranky yovgCranky yovgCranky the final boss of IV is easy tho
[4:06:49] <+Jokylvl> Are you by yourself?
[4:06:57] <%umbypokochan> one time I used Game Genie to sequence break and I had both Rydias at the end
[4:06:58] <+JenovasPuppet> How much grinding would you do on stream?
[4:07:11] <%krawtch> FF8 steps on its own balls the second you come back from space
[4:07:12] <+Arxel1> jacknerik yes
[4:07:20] <%Doctor_Death_Bed> @PeachSaliva you would play a game that you hate...and you refuse to play Dragons Dogma?
[4:07:21] <%Doctor_Death_Bed> how could you
[4:07:24] <%krawtch> then it stumbles backwards and slips on its own shit
[4:07:27] <$Trenr> the fact that it goes to space at all is wild
[4:07:27] <+Jokylvl> Because whos that behind you 😵
[4:07:30] <%Doctor_Death_Bed> I thought we were something Paige
[4:07:31] <@JustinianKnight> VIII is probably my 2nd favorite
[4:07:39] <$Kain5707> 10 hour stream? limesPoggers
[4:07:39] <zamzoph> "So I grinded offscreen..."
[4:07:42] <+Blain_Cooper> NO grinding in 8
[4:07:43] <+HajimenoStream> grind AWAY
[4:08:04] <%umbypokochan> always watching...
[4:08:04] <+FedoraNinja> 8 was the first one i beat
[4:08:05] <AncelDeLambert> the first hour of FF8 is nothing BUT grinding!
[4:08:08] <%krawtch> there's always the skell and the 'scemi
[4:08:09] <+simpo98> also the Junction System is easily exploitable @PeachSaliva @krawtch
[4:08:11] <leinadtonu> emotional support skeleton ftw
[4:08:15] <+JenovasPuppet> @Blain_Cooper You don't grind levels, but if you want to be good you've got to grind Draws.
[4:08:16] <Luesagna00> @peachsaliva it's not a video series, its a long ass stream. i imagine ppl assume grinding and shit in games
[4:08:19] <%SuperCasualBoom> FF8? You mean Triple Triad and that other game?
[4:08:21] <+ZombehTaco879> whered the goblin run off to?
[4:08:28] <+Mekhet09> GRIND IN 8 so you have some challenge.
[4:08:32] <%krawtch> junction system was garbage because you could never use your best magics because doing so would make your stats go down
[4:08:33] <+Jokylvl> Seems like your having lots of fun
[4:08:35] <$Trenr> crying intensifies
[4:08:42] <hntronium> Not even in death does duty end
[4:08:47] <castcode> FF8 the Ultimate Stockpiling Triple Triad Simulator
[4:08:47] <+Mekhet09> Level one runs were garbage because the game was easier.
[4:08:51] <%krawtch> also drawing 99 of any magic was cancer
[4:08:54] <+simpo98> aye @krawtch
[4:08:55] <Gameslayer2> I must be the only one that loves junctioning magic
[4:08:58] <+BringBackSempai> you can turn off the active system in 6 at least
[4:09:00] <weapon000> I love Woolie and Liam's Triple Triad video
[4:09:03] <%umbypokochan> play that ugly ass version of XV that's coming out that's really just a phone game
[4:09:07] <@JustinianKnight> I never had a problem with Junction
[4:09:08] <+BringBackSempai> or at least make it incredibly slow
[4:09:08] <+simpo98> totally agree
[4:09:18] <+Mekhet09> I like junctioning I just think you need to be smart about how you grinding.
[4:09:22] <$Arazien> If you drew 99 of any magic instead of refining it, then you're just bad at the game
[4:09:22] <+BringBackSempai> also 6 has "co-op"
[4:09:24] <demonhunter790> “Starting to lose it” implies you had it to begin with
[4:09:24] <castcode> That triple triad video was nice
[4:09:26] <%DuffMacwhalen> Triple triad aka the entire FF8 playthru
[4:09:26] <+JenovasPuppet> @Gameslayer2 I loved junctioning the first time I played, but it kills be every time I try to replay it.
[4:09:28] <deviljhojho94> IT WAS ICONIC
[4:09:28] <%DuffMacwhalen> It's fun.,
[4:09:31] <%krawtch> and drawing 99 of MULTIPLE magics, THREE TIMES for each member in the party was TERRIBLE
[4:09:42] <%AbnormalVoid> the main problem with the story is how incredibly dumb the story and lore is
[4:09:49] <%AbnormalVoid> with FF8*
[4:09:50] <Anonymasque> 13 deserves nothing but rejection..
[4:09:55] <%CaptainPileDriver> why not play a final fantasy no one talks about like 9, cause i don't know anything about 9
[4:09:57] <%SuperCasualBoom> FF8 = Final Fantasy Pokemon Card Game
[4:09:59] <+simpo98> Also Paige Triple Triad is in FFXIV :D @PeachSaliva
[4:10:02] <zamzoph> 9 <3
[4:10:05] <%krawtch> ff8 was going toward a pretty cool story but then they threw that in the garbage and told an unoriginal love story instead
[4:10:06] <%DuffMacwhalen> i hated 9.
[4:10:15] <+BringBackSempai> 9 is a throwback to all the NES and SNES games
[4:10:26] <@JustinianKnight> love 9
[4:10:28] <$Arazien> 9 is a delight
[4:10:29] <%SuperCasualBoom> 9 great but the startup to battles are too long.
[4:10:30] <deviljhojho94> 9 was glorious
[4:10:35] <%AbnormalVoid> like, 8's use of the amnesia trope is so forced
[4:10:36] <+simpo98> 9 is amazing
[4:10:41] <+simpo98> the cast is great
[4:10:43] <%umbypokochan> that jump rope crap can suck it
[4:10:44] <+textandnumbers> i love 9's world and soundtrack. i didn't enjoy the characters
[4:10:44] <+Calypso345> 9 is a goddamn masterpiece
[4:10:44] <demonhunter790> Why was 6 afraid of 7?
[4:10:46] <%DuffMacwhalen> It was too much of a shift for me. I started with mystic quest then 7 and 8
[4:10:50] <Eresus> 9 is easily in the top 5
[4:11:01] <deviljhojho94> Cotton
[4:11:04] <%CaptainPileDriver> cool, ginger buns senior
[4:11:05] <ryu1299> cause 7 sold more even tho it's trasherino
[4:11:06] <Dragonfang1337> Is Pat's dad just stronger pat?
[4:11:09] <castcode> Old Man Boivin Johnny Cash - Hurt.mp3
[4:11:12] <hypoid77> tell us more about pat's shit
[4:11:15] <+BringBackSempai> out of all the SNES FF games to play, how did you get mystic quest?
[4:11:16] <hntronium> There's a reason why Pat's dad is his God
[4:11:18] <AMajorTom> selectively provate
[4:11:18] <$Retrocop87> Steiner is one of the best FF characters. Rusty got your back
[4:11:19] <%SuperCasualBoom> Pat? Private?
[4:11:23] <ryu1299> it's actually pretty great but I like 6 more
[4:11:25] <legendarysabertooth> Reserved is the word
[4:11:29] <hntronium> His mom too
[4:11:42] <hypoid77> A french she-cotton hill?
[4:11:42] <hntronium> So we can finally find out if her accent is like that
[4:11:45] <bambowl> ooh hey dare
[4:11:50] <%umbypokochan> Scott Steiner?
[4:11:54] <zamzoph> Vivi used to be my favorite, but now Steiner is
[4:11:54] <dawnengel> hey paige being so ill all the time how do you find strength to tracel so much? that was the first thing to go for me when i got sick
[4:12:01] <dawnengel> *travel
[4:12:03] <%krawtch> i bought FF9 on steam but havent played it yet
[4:12:03] <+simpo98> Beatrix Best girl from FF9 :3
[4:12:09] <$Arazien> Steiner, Freya, and Beatrix are the best!
[4:12:12] <%krawtch> i bought it like a year ago though
[4:12:14] <+JenovasPuppet> Beatrix is best tsundere
[4:12:29] <+Real_Todd_Howard> Drinking mustard helps
[4:12:31] <%SuperCasualBoom> Steiner love Beatrice’s FAT ASSES!!
[4:12:34] <%CaptainPileDriver> you should really try persona 4, would love to see you hang out with the tough guy who can throw a motercycle but then is amazing at sowing
[4:12:39] <AncelDeLambert> the proud buffoun? Well, you're dating one, so.
[4:12:58] <AncelDeLambert> @peachsaliva You and Pat are totally Beatrix and Steiner.
[4:13:14] <+BringBackSempai> Steiner is a reference to Mr Thou
[4:13:19] <+jK00215> Sabin can suplex a ghost train!!!
[4:13:40] <dawnengel> i miss traveling....it makes me so sock now
[4:13:44] <dawnengel> *sick
[4:13:46] <%SuperCasualBoom> OMG Woolie is the Ninja from FF9. Right down to the hair and willing kill people.

[4:14:52] <CurrySauseBandit> College algerbra or calculus?
[4:14:58] <+ZombehTaco879> would you be willing to play through ff tactics?
[4:14:58] <Anonymasque> Math?! That's for losers!
[4:14:59] <dawnengel> tifa tits man
[4:15:01] <SatansDick1> i can help with your math homewotk
[4:15:12] <bambowl> at least you didnt have to drop out of school because of math
[4:15:13] <SatansDick1> im a math major
[4:15:17] <CurrySauseBandit> Why not jsut take an online course?
[4:15:17] <demonhunter790> I can’t cheat. I only have math classes.
[4:15:28] <%rdark_ksu> I basically have learned helplessness when it comes to math
[4:15:35] <tacostarvedbeast> @peachsaliva need help on my debate essay homework on which condiment is the best
[4:15:49] <Anonymasque> Math class became..laugh class. ...I'm sorry about this.
[4:15:52] <+Calypso345> damn, yang is strong
[4:15:53] <+Real_Todd_Howard> @tacostarvedbeast you already know the answer is mustard
[4:15:58] <%Remery_> Math is fun Calculus is not fun
[4:16:00] <%krawtch> i used to be not great at math, but then i learned to do trigonometric functions in my head like a big boy
[4:16:06] <castcode> Page and the 500 year Mustard War
[4:16:13] <dawnengel> i cried over my math homework in high school...it s was seriously painful to watch
[4:16:27] <SatansDick1> @Remery_ hey calculus is pretty fun
[4:16:45] <SatansDick1> :(
[4:16:46] <@JustinianKnight> I hate Math too
[4:16:48] <+Calypso345> Dude Beast Wars is legit my favorite show
[4:16:51] <Dragonfang1337> I just gave up
[4:17:02] <%Remery_> @SatansDick1 the moment I have to put an equation onto a grid my brain stops working
[4:17:04] <demonhunter790> I laugh hysterically into tears
[4:17:11] <+Everpresent_Overseer> What about beast machine math?
[4:17:15] <+Calypso345> its so fucking good
[4:17:15] <dawnengel> i would bang my head on the desk
[4:17:24] <RyuuAoi> What we playin', bios?
[4:17:25] <leinadtonu> I don't remember how beast war ends...
[4:17:25] <%SuperCasualBoom> Fuck that y = mx + b shit
[4:17:30] <dawnengel> well i mean not hard but...yea
[4:17:34] <XdaXcaptainX> i always thought these hydras just looked liked balls of regular snakes
[4:17:37] <+Mekhet09> That's just a line.
[4:17:39] <%krawtch> Rat Trap + wheelchair = tears
[4:17:41] <AncelDeLambert> no, algebra is and has always been the hardest part of math
[4:17:48] <tacostarvedbeast> Beast wars has waspinator, easy top tier
[4:17:48] <AncelDeLambert> Calculus isn't hard, the algebra is
[4:17:56] <+Mekhet09> What.
[4:18:00] <@JustinianKnight> you can turn off Active tho
[4:18:06] <+Mekhet09> Calculus is a lot more challenging.
[4:18:11] <@JustinianKnight> at least put it on Wait anyways
[4:18:13] <bambowl> i get depressed and really self critical with math for some reason
[4:18:23] <SatansDick1> @AncelDeLambert funny, most of my mistakes from calculus were from algebra
[4:18:24] <demonhunter790> Calculus was easy, Cal 2 though...
[4:18:26] <AncelDeLambert> it really isn't. Calculus is super easy, untangling the algebra is the pain
[4:18:27] <RyuuAoi> Oh shit! Peach do it!
[4:18:38] <%generalve> She doesn't like 6 ?!?!
[4:18:40] <@JustinianKnight> Stragos
[4:18:45] <RyuuAoi> Going where Zaibatsu DREAMS
[4:18:45] <+Mekhet09> Try multivariable calculus.
[4:18:55] <AncelDeLambert> that stuff I use constantly?
[4:18:57] <+Calypso345> Relm and Strago
[4:18:58] <%galaxyswirl> stragos id radical ttho
[4:18:58] <Anonymasque> One of my top tier childhood toys was my Optimus Primal. Arms were all chrome painted n' shit.
[4:19:02] <dawnengel> i wanna play 6
[4:19:07] <%umbypokochan> but Relm has the best dungeon in the second part of the game
[4:19:08] <dawnengel> you should do 6
[4:19:10] <%DuffMacwhalen> TIFA THO'
[4:19:12] <+JenovasPuppet> I don't like how there's a million ways to break the game, but no secret, ultra strong bosses to test your might against.
[4:19:16] <SatansDick1> @Mekhet09 i have , its the algebra the messes me up
[4:19:17] <+Real_Todd_Howard> @Mekhet09 stop I've already cried enough today
[4:19:18] <%SuperCasualBoom> Gau’s skill learning was horrible
[4:19:20] <tacostarvedbeast> Paige loves anime ass anime hair
[4:19:21] <%generalve> VIII is good it had good games FU
[4:19:31] <XdaXcaptainX> anyone that hasnt played 6 yet is living an empty shadow life
[4:19:31] <deviljhojho94> you just love her cuz of her body
[4:19:36] <%SuperCasualBoom> It was cause of the titties
[4:19:39] <%krawtch> aeris is barely a character
[4:19:40] <+Calypso345> Btw peach, I'm 80s guy from Road Rage Portland
[4:19:41] <Eresus> the only thing I dont like about FF7 is vincent
[4:19:48] <ancrest_tant> Dilly dally shilly shally
[4:19:49] <+LowBatteryLife> yuffie/redxiii fics, i will die on this hill
[4:19:54] <dawnengel> tifa tits
[4:19:55] <@JustinianKnight> Tifa is probably my fav of the ladies
[4:19:55] <+BringBackSempai> I played the GBA version of 6, and it was weird actually being able to use Relm'
[4:19:58] <%generalve> Tifa sipsipGasm sipsipGasm sipsipGasm sipsipGasm sipsipGasm sipsipGasm
[4:19:59] <+BringBackSempai> s sketch
[4:19:59] <weapon000> I think I like 6 just a little better than 4. but they are both my faves.
[4:19:59] <RyuuAoi> Paige, do VII before Pat 😈
[4:20:02] <SephytheOWA> Love Tifa, any girl who can punch the hell out of stuff is good in my book! >:3
[4:20:03] <+BringBackSempai> without breaking the game
[4:20:10] <$Kain5707> Yufi is a vineBab in 7
[4:20:16] <$Arazien> I found the Woolie
[4:20:20] <deviljhojho94> @LowBatteryLife Ah, my lost kin
[4:20:23] <+Blain_Cooper> @PeachSaliva How do you feel about the DS remake of this game?
[4:20:26] <%DuffMacwhalen> Everybody loves Tifa. If you don't you ain't no friend of mine.
[4:20:30] <$waltzqueen> heya just got outta work wassup
[4:20:37] <+JenovasPuppet> Probably not. Waiting for the remake.
[4:20:39] <RyuuAoi> DO VII
[4:20:41] <Sayie> Tifa is overrated as hell
[4:20:42] <deviljhojho94> PUNCHGIRLS Clap Clap Clap Clap Clap
[4:20:44] <Anonymasque> Aeris's character probably won't have the same impact in a remake. Like I'd find it hard to care now.
[4:20:47] <SatansDick1> !uptime
[4:20:51] <%generalve> Hey peach what next afternoon stream game will you play after this ?
[4:20:53] <tacostarvedbeast> Need a dart board with all the ffs ud play and just use that to pick the order
[4:20:56] <$Kain5707> what remake Kappa
[4:20:59] <Prevot> the remake will take so long you could play 7 now and forget it all by then
[4:21:01] <+JoeStillLife> LUL Remake
[4:21:11] <RyuuAoi> Cloud is BEST Smash
[4:21:17] <+Calypso345> lol the remake that will never happen
[4:21:20] <ancrest_tant> You mean that FF XV mod
[4:21:25] <demonhunter790> Is pat good at math ?
[4:21:32] <@JustinianKnight> I'll just be waiting for it...forever
[4:21:39] <SatansDick1> @demonhunter790 no he isnt
[4:21:57] <demonhunter790> Truly they were made for each other
[4:22:05] <dawnengel> man you're shennigans have got me through so much bullshit lol
[4:22:07] <$waltzqueen> good embarrasment strats
[4:22:13] <RyuuAoi> I love you, Peach! What a QUEEN!
[4:22:50] <SatansDick1> hey chat ive never played a final fantasy game, where should i start
[4:22:57] <$Kain5707> Mustard Queen
[4:23:04] <demonhunter790> How dare they be happy ?!
[4:23:05] <+LowBatteryLife> Positivity steamers are actually poison to me, a salty bitch.
[4:23:17] <dawnengel> i can relate to you two
[4:23:25] <+Calypso345> @satansdick1 Final Fantasy 7 is where a lot of people started
[4:23:25] <+jK00215> @peachsaliva You do you twitch mom!!
[4:23:49] <TheMilhouseExperience> NegaPaige is Paige's secret ending final boss.
[4:23:54] <Eresus> @Calypso345 it was also the first FF to be released in europe
[4:23:57] <RyuuAoi> Woolie salt is saltiest salt
[4:23:57] <%krawtch> as a terrible shadow human i dont like needlessly positive, high energy people
[4:24:02] <demonhunter790> I like seeing the cracks in the happy armor .
[4:24:03] <mistermastergreg> No one can be as possitive as Elmo
[4:24:10] <+Calypso345> @eresus ah that makes sense
[4:24:13] <$waltzqueen> some people are rock lee and some are sauske in a rock lee mask
[4:24:25] <Kaitepaints> Paige is my favorite ginger
[4:24:31] <@JustinianKnight> @SatansDick1 I recommend starting with 9
[4:24:40] <$Kain5707> BEEP BEEP
[4:24:53] <Anonymasque> I think it's more about being authentic rather than being this huge facade. You can be positive for your community as long as you're being honest to a degree.
[4:24:54] <RyuuAoi> @satansdick1 You can literally play the first game for free now a days.
[4:25:03] <tacostarvedbeast> I need pat to cosplay everyone’s fav ff ginger wakka
[4:25:07] <+LowBatteryLife> Hey, go listen to "Worthless" from the Brave Little Toaster soundtrack. It's very good.
[4:25:10] <%SuperCasualBoom> cheer200 When SNES Final Fantasy was a thing I made my own fanfic as a kid where the classic monsters played the cast. Imagine...an imp hero, a dragon dragoon, a tonberry monk, a blue mage Marboro, balloon karate master, Ninja cactuar. I think Enix miss the boat on such a story.
[4:25:10] <arcaderabbit48> @SatansDick1 If you want an older one, FF6 is good. FF7 is the generally considered best PSX on. 9 is more of a throw back to the classics, which might be lost on you, but its really good on its own merits too. If you want a turn based newer game, 10. Otherwise, 15 is honestly a fine place to start if you just want to jump in.
[4:25:11] <leinadtonu> @SatansDick1 I'd suggest 9 6 7
[4:25:14] <pectusumbra> right, another day or work tomorrow, gotta call it. good night
[4:25:14] <%krawtch> woke him up from the shit coma
[4:25:17] <+Calypso345> @ryuuaoi i would NOT recommend 1
[4:25:27] <%generalve> did she all ready go through all the donations kr did i miss them ?
[4:25:28] <ancrest_tant> @satansdick1 I would pick 7, 9, or 10. You could literally pick any though
[4:25:29] <Prevot> I like that Pat is just laying awake in bed
[4:25:34] <@JustinianKnight> yea 9 6 or 7 are good picks
[4:25:41] <SatansDick1> so 9 6 and 7
[4:25:52] <+Calypso345> yep
[4:25:52] <GreatestGuess> Disgusting happy people DansGame
[4:25:55] <%SuperCasualBoom> Go down
[4:26:05] <Luesagna00> @peachsaliva my favorite ginger is gingerade.
[4:26:07] <%krawtch> it reeks of being not genuine
[4:26:15] <demonhunter790> What does false happiness smell like Paige ?
[4:26:17] <$Kain5707> when is Paige playing Snake Eater?
[4:26:17] <RyuuAoi> @calypso345 You gotta though! Completionist here. I now. It's a curse.
[4:26:18] <$waltzqueen> start at ff1 and work uup, feel the improvement with each gen
[4:26:22] <RyuuAoi> *know
[4:26:32] <@JustinianKnight> My favs are all the PS1 games
[4:26:40] <@JustinianKnight> and 14
[4:26:43] <Eresus> 7/6 > 9 > 10 for me
[4:26:51] <+Calypso345> @ryuuaoi oh ive played it, just as a starting point i wouldn't recommend it
[4:26:52] <chambatron> What about triple triads?
[4:26:54] <ancrest_tant> It's 6 then 7 for me
[4:26:59] <Gnapalm> People whos favourite is 10 are heathens, just like me
[4:27:06] <Kaitepaints> Hey @peachsaliva I was recently hit by a car and it fuckin sucked. You’ve been in an accident before, did you feel like you changed emotionally? I’ve been lashing out quite a lot towards my loved ones and it sucks. It happens before I can stop it.
[4:27:07] <+tigerfang86> Paige loves trash? I'M SHOCKED
[4:27:10] <@JustinianKnight> hahaha
[4:27:12] <Dragonfang1337> D:
[4:27:12] <leinadtonu> 9 isn't the best but I love it, if that makes any sense.
[4:27:13] <%krawtch> weird how the PS2 only got one final fantasy game, since FF12 and X-2 dont count as video games.
[4:27:16] <%generalve> YEYEYE
[4:27:18] <jhp209> ps1 was my fisrt system
[4:27:19] <+CaptainJax> boo this woman
[4:27:21] <@JustinianKnight> I have like every TT card in 14
[4:27:22] <deviljhojho94> D:
[4:27:23] <+JenovasPuppet> wat
[4:27:24] <tacostarvedbeast> Ever played legend of dragoon?
[4:27:24] <+tigerfang86> Paige hates good card games? I'M SHOCKED AGAIN
[4:27:26] <HannibalBeerus> WHAT
[4:27:27] <castcode> IT BEGINS
[4:27:27] <deviljhojho94> UNSUBBED
[4:27:29] <$waltzqueen> that sucks @Kaitepaints
[4:27:33] <+JenovasPuppet> surely you mean the shit game from 9?
[4:27:35] <HannibalBeerus> UNSUBBED FROM SUPER BUNNY HOP
[4:27:36] <%generalve> card games suck
[4:27:37] <+srkAres> its because oyu have to use your brain for TT
[4:27:40] <ancrest_tant> Someone inform Woolie
[4:27:49] <RyuuAoi> @calypso345 Right on! You gave it a go. That matters! At least you're not oblivious to the origins.
[4:27:51] <%DuffMacwhalen> Sounds like PTSD
[4:28:15] <NooblettOfWar> or Low grade TBI... which may look like PTSD.
[4:28:18] <Kaitepaints> Grooossssss
[4:28:37] <chambatron> What about yugi or hearthstone? Do you hate card games in general?
[4:28:43] <+FadingEmber> But you should ask professional not streamer bro. No offense Paige
[4:28:47] <SatansDick1> dddddduel
[4:28:51] <Kaitepaints> I have been going to a councilor but they’re out of town
[4:29:04] <NooblettOfWar> @Kaitepaints has your balance changed or have a hard time doing normal day stuff like writing or talking?
[4:29:12] <Kaitepaints> Awwwwww.... thanks Paige
[4:29:23] <RyuuAoi> Peach, do you like Fighters? (Fighting Games)
[4:29:47] <RyuuAoi> Is Pat a fighter? Ha
[4:29:48] <Luesagna00> @peachsaliva physical therapy helps with stuff from physical trauma. massage therapy can rly help
[4:29:50] <Gnapalm> Did you get the fatal cutie hat, paige?
[4:30:08] <Kaitepaints> Ohhh yeah. I had flash backs really bad the first few weeks
[4:30:09] <+Arxel1> Scrubladies? LUL
[4:30:09] <NooblettOfWar> i had a friend that had both TBI and Induced coma... out for a week.. had to re-learn how to read,write, and walk.
[4:30:23] <SatansDick1> pat teaching figthing games LUL
[4:30:23] <%generalve> Hey @peachsaliva if you and pat ever go to the barcade in Brooklyn or in New Jersey Newark. drinks are on me
[4:30:24] <leinadtonu> It would be cool to see a stream with Pat or Woolie showing you the ropes.
[4:30:27] <RyuuAoi> Fighters would be hype!
[4:30:28] <Prevot> too much mcdonalds
[4:30:30] <%DuffMacwhalen> You had five burgers and a gallon of soda at nearly midnight
[4:30:31] <$waltzqueen> maybe some wter will help
[4:30:31] <@PinkieTheEerie> @PeachSaliva yea i had that before, got a sunbuurn that was a 3rd degree burn, the pain turned me into a FUCKING NUT. a angry bastard too. therepy is a need for that kinda thing, for a long time i wouldent leave my house out of fear of it happeneing again, dont let tramua rule your life my guy
[4:30:35] <%DuffMacwhalen> baka
[4:30:38] <tacostarvedbeast> Fighting games to Paige’s wrists? That won’t end well
[4:30:43] <GreatestGuess> After that SFV stream, pat teaching fighting games LUL
[4:30:50] <demonhunter790> Update on math homework, I am 10% done ✅
[4:30:51] <RyuuAoi> Ppppatron??
[4:30:52] <chambatron> U should cosplay female terry
[4:30:53] <Gnapalm> more coffee. throw a red bull in there. become patrice
[4:31:02] <deviljhojho94> YA
[4:31:05] <RyuuAoi> Did she say Patron?
[4:31:22] <bambowl> monster girls?
[4:31:25] <%DuffMacwhalen> then again here i am drinking four cups of coffee and my bedtime is in less than an hour, so what do I know.
[4:31:26] <AncelDeLambert> @peachsaliva no caffienated drinks after 6PM, silly billy
[4:31:34] <+BringBackSempai> I miss Squaresoft
[4:31:34] <$waltzqueen> you could have stopped at people love funking monster and been totally right
[4:31:36] <grayjammer> Monsters Only Parties are always the best idea ever, and it's a crime it's not more prevalent
[4:31:37] <demonhunter790> Did someone say Monster Girls ?
[4:31:39] <SatansDick1> @bambowl yes
[4:31:39] <dawnengel> caffine does does diddly for me
[4:31:40] <arcaderabbit48> I think there's a webcomic with that premise? Rusty and Co. I think?
[4:31:41] <@JustinianKnight> I think World of FF has monsters you can use at least
[4:31:45] <SGrim> Hot
[4:31:47] <@JustinianKnight> havent tried yet tho
[4:32:02] <RyuuAoi> @bringbacksempai #Whens3rdBirthday
[4:32:04] <%Ell1ot> hi Paige! i left to go get pizza because pizza is better than McDonald's
[4:32:05] <SatansDick1> spidergirls are best. fight me
[4:32:06] <%Sadira_snack_attack> World of FF is basically FF Pokemon
[4:32:06] <GreatestGuess> FFIX Frey’s is a top tier monster girl
[4:32:06] <Gnapalm> but the sugar crashes put me to sleep!
[4:32:11] <+CaptainJax> Monster Girl Quest stream when
[4:32:28] <SGrim> @SatansDick1 Spider Girls are just a lower order of Centaur. Get fucked rooKek
[4:32:29] <%SuperCasualBoom> The summons could all be humans. Be interesting
[4:32:29] <Eresus> they are not nomura characters
[4:32:29] <+Superstarsage> Licensing issues Paige
[4:32:34] <RyuuAoi> Peach, you play any of the Persona series?
[4:32:35] <@JustinianKnight> Nomura did not design them
[4:32:42] <@JustinianKnight> so he didn't want to use any
[4:32:45] <shadowgilgamesh> World of FF has 2 teams of 3, and 2 of each team are monsters, that's the closest yeah
[4:32:47] <+Superstarsage> Oh it's just Nomura nevermind
[4:32:51] <grayjammer> Monster GFs < Monster BFs
[4:32:51] <SatansDick1> @SGrim no bully spider
[4:32:52] <arcaderabbit48> Cecil had his Dark Knight armor literally bolted on to his skin, I'd call that pretty edgey
[4:32:54] <GreatestGuess> What about the DS remake?
[4:32:55] <demonhunter790> Where do you draw the line on monster girls?
[4:32:55] <boldandsaucywrongs> Even though Cecil literally wields THE DARKNESS
[4:32:56] <TheMilhouseExperience> There aren't any belts.
[4:32:56] <Gnapalm> there are X-2 characters, of all things
[4:32:56] <+Arxel1> But how are Kain or Cecil or LITERAL EDGE not Edgy Peach?!
[4:32:59] <Eresus> the only snes FF character in KH is Setzer
[4:33:07] <leinadtonu> It's hard to be edgy enough to hang out with Goofy.
[4:33:11] <+LogothX> nomura used setzer and he didnt design him
[4:33:11] <%HoldBtoRun> during the ps1 rpg era, before I knew what fanfic was, my friends and I wrote our own jrpgs in a notebook, complete with battles, exp, spells, and key items. it disappeared in my early teen years and I miss it
[4:33:14] <%SuperCasualBoom> Tellah did more than Aeris. He unleashed to Meteo to die. What Aeris do? Prays and gets stab
[4:33:16] <einSynd> It's okay, in the future Edge has three edgy kids
[4:33:18] <TheBlankAce> Setzer is in Kingdom Hearts 2
[4:33:31] <@JustinianKnight> because Nomura helped with 6 designs
[4:33:32] <SGrim> @SatansDick1 if the argument for spider boils down to "no bulli," then they truly are the inferior species rooSmug
[4:33:38] <tacostarvedbeast> A malboro paladin would be a fun character
[4:33:40] <+LogothX> kh2 setzer sucks big time too
[4:33:42] <%krawtch> aeris had voices in her head and ran around like a spaz all the time.
[4:33:54] <%generalve> do you watch avoidingthepuddle
[4:33:55] <%SuperCasualBoom> Yep.
[4:34:01] <Gnapalm> did you ever try X2 paige?
[4:34:07] <@JustinianKnight> Setzer in KH2 is just a guy that runs a mini game basically
[4:34:08] <arcaderabbit48> Tonberry Scholars do exist in 14, and a Tonberry Black Mage I think
[4:34:09] <KeiPrime> kh2 setzer jobs out to roxas
[4:34:11] <deviljhojho94> Setzer is cool fuck you
[4:34:16] <%SuperCasualBoom> Seltzer sucks
[4:34:16] <SatansDick1> @SGrim but centars are probably the ost vanilla mongirls
[4:34:23] <Dragonfang1337> "We totally OWNED you LAMERS"
[4:34:23] <%DuffMacwhalen> Avoidingthepuddle is Aris, the hagrid looking dude of Tekken casting
[4:34:24] <%umbypokochan> setzer makes the cute little rabbit with the hat come out and say Mugu Mugu
[4:34:26] <SatansDick1> most
[4:34:28] <deviljhojho94> i will shit on your yard
[4:34:29] <castcode> I kinda want setzer to be in 3
[4:34:31] <%Ell1ot> where's the little magic girl you kidnapped?
[4:34:31] <+LogothX> in kh2 setzer is out of character, he cries like a dumb baby
[4:34:33] <%generalve> Aris. he is a twitch streamer
[4:34:39] <%krawtch> so KH2 used Setzer better than MGS5 used Ocelot
[4:34:40] <+BringBackSempai> this stream needs a Beard Puddle emote
[4:34:42] <%craig_t> @PeachSaliva aris, aka avoiding the puddle, is a tekken streamer. cool guy
[4:34:46] <demonhunter790> Quick shoutout to AvoidingthePuddle
[4:34:49] <deviljhojho94> No i said fuck you to the other guy BibleThump
[4:34:51] <+JenovasPuppet> Setzer is the best! At sucking!
[4:34:51] <+animio> setzer is ok i guess
[4:34:52] <%SleepyFranke> alka seltzer is lovely though for when I have tummy issues
[4:34:55] <chambatron> Alka who?
[4:34:55] <%SuperCasualBoom> Setzer > Seltzer
[4:34:56] <demonhunter790> I think he’s fine
[4:34:57] <@JustinianKnight> Setzer is great man
[4:34:57] <Gnapalm> Sezter can catch this dick
[4:34:57] <dawnengel> *sells tickets*
[4:35:05] <tacostarvedbeast> Setzer leaves the seat up
[4:35:07] <Luesagna00> @peachsaliva Hate the banned that you liiiiiike!
[4:35:09] <AncelDeLambert> which one is Setzer again?
[4:35:14] <suhmguy> Setzer is bad in fights but cool in the story
[4:35:16] <RyuuAoi> Do REVELATIONS: PERSONA a.k.a. Persona PSP
[4:35:17] <%DuffMacwhalen> You've seen his face if you've watched Tekken 7 tornies
[4:35:17] <deviljhojho94> how come pat and paige only notice my horrible comments
[4:35:21] <+LogothX> ff6 sezter is the shit
[4:35:22] <%DuffMacwhalen> big hagrid beard boy
[4:35:24] <@JustinianKnight> Gambler/Airship Pilot from 6
[4:35:26] <%Ell1ot> can i get a story recap? i missed a bunch of the stream
[4:35:29] <bambowl> its either setzer talk or spider girl talk. its gettin weird in here @peachsaliva
[4:35:32] <@JustinianKnight> throws cards
[4:35:33] <%umbypokochan> Setzer is good if you are good at the slots, which are easy with practice
[4:35:39] <weapon000> the coolest thing about setzer is his airship
[4:35:39] <mistermastergreg> Setzer is the final fighter at a childs tournament in kh2, he's an adult
[4:35:42] <$cerass> I gotta avoid the puddle every time I jerk it
[4:35:44] <%SuperCasualBoom> Setzer rolls dice. Selzer is sparkling water
[4:35:54] <deviljhojho94> 4Head
[4:35:55] <SatansDick1> setzer is a bitch baby
[4:36:01] <@JustinianKnight> yea
[4:36:02] <RyuuAoi> @ell1ot We FF now!
[4:36:05] <+Superstarsage> darryl?
[4:36:08] <+tigerfang86> the coolest thing about someone is SOMEONE ELSE?
[4:36:11] <+SchlomoGoldbergsteinowitz> His girlfriend Derek
[4:36:11] <@JustinianKnight> Daryl
[4:36:13] <KeiPrime> random death darts on undead that revives them, thanks setzer
[4:36:13] <+LogothX> Daryl
[4:36:14] <+tigerfang86> paige plz
[4:36:15] <HannibalBeerus> LIZARD DOCTOR
[4:36:17] <arcaderabbit48> Setzer is kind of a womanizer though. Like, he plans on kidnapping an opera singer to be his bride
[4:36:18] <+sixcubit> i appreciate how there are just real ass crocodiles in this cave. they're not magical monsters at all. you just show up and punch a lizard
[4:36:22] <deviljhojho94> Setzer's gf was probably that shitty mime
[4:36:24] <QaizerArt> DARYL
[4:36:25] <SatansDick1> hey chat scub or antiscub
[4:36:29] <QaizerArt> Daryl the cutest
[4:36:31] <castcode> rip Daryl
[4:36:32] <$waltzqueen> Scub
[4:36:34] <%generalve> to much McDonald's Paige Kappa
[4:36:37] <%CyborgAV> Scub, duh.
[4:36:37] <%umbypokochan> you ate too much worm burgers
[4:36:37] <ryu1299> big good stream
[4:36:40] <$cerass> Damn I missed the stream
