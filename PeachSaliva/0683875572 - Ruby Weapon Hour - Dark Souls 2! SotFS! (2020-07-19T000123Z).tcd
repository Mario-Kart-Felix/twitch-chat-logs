[0:09:05] <%oda_flobunaga> sooooo, is the goal for her to beat it by Aug. 1st? then?
[0:09:08] <+Promessa_EX> imagine if peach streams had hololive chat rules
[0:09:13] <destinyspider> Wait, Pat doesn't have as much hair as this animation is advertising
[0:09:17] <Skatedeandre> Kusa
[0:09:20] <@SoFarFetched> Is this why she's trying to go through dark souls fast,before the anniversary
[0:09:20] <+Promessa_EX> everyone would just type kusa
[0:09:21] <$Sphincter_Spelunker> she'd be lucky to beat 1 DLC area by the 1st
[0:09:22] <%Bane_Kaikyo> Bane_Kaikyo subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 6 months! I was invited to a friend's DnD Campaign (quarantine approved of course) and I'm hella excited! If stop procrastinating, I'll be working on my character sheet and doodling stuff during this stream. I'll be playing as a Goliath so I'll be BIG anf STRONG!!
[0:09:23] <KoyaMusa> god you know she can't
[0:09:25] <@SoFarFetched> she'd have to skip the DLC then and do it later
[0:09:28] <+TopTieramisu> pekora, subaru, haachama

[0:09:30] <$NitronStreams> 草
[0:09:32] <artificerjoni> @redmagerebel Cranky's chat is pretty chill.
[0:09:35] <Vaardvark> the goal was to beat it by the end of august 2019 LUL
[0:09:35] <+TopTieramisu> wwwwww
[0:09:43] <@SoFarFetched> unless pat conveniently saves paige's save file so she can go back to the DLC after beating main game.
[0:09:45] <%Royalguard22> I hope she never finishes it. It just moves into different arcs.
[0:09:45] <Skatedeandre> Hachama is super cursed I love her
[0:09:51] <+Promessa_EX> かわいい草
[0:10:01] <%oda_flobunaga> she's just a couple of 24 hour streams away from beating it maybe?
[0:10:04] <+TopTieramisu> if you want scuffed asmr, subaru is your one stop shop
[0:10:04] <NireFuster> I'm sure Peaches will beat ds2 by the 3rd anniversary
[0:10:05] <$NitronStreams> Big草
[0:10:08] <@SoFarFetched> cause I can see her doing the DLC after beating main game.Then beat the game again after finishing the DLC.
[0:10:11] <%RedMageRebel> I need to watch more cranky @artificerjoni . i really only use twitch for pat and paige and critical role, and some vinny streams if i catch them
[0:10:12] <+Sir_Gawain_Lotsson> crikHype
[0:10:19] <+TopTieramisu> the dlc is definitely gonna pad the time

[0:26:13] <rajathene> Paige, for D&D you would have to keep track of a story, multiple plot lines, combat turn orders- and then do the calculations for your attacks once it was your turn. You would need America to send you your drugs.
[0:26:13] <Coystick> eww
[0:26:14] <SilverFaustX> tng on twitch ?
[0:26:15] <@ckbooks> It's hard to choose between Trek and Souls.

First performance since all this covid business started. hopefully I can still scream up there! lol have a great time, and thank you all for all the good times.

[0:34:49] <+zamatermort> Does Paige have the lock on?
[0:34:50] <$Niney_Who> Didn't Pat set a Password so she doesn't get invaded?
[0:34:51] <+BigCoffee> Pat is right, post poop showers are the best.

[0:35:15] <sosuke5> he loves it!
[0:35:17] <+mMayrro> they tried the ring chat
[0:35:17] <+Scevda> Server dissonance?
[0:35:18] <+OwlLightningMage> Paige probably got banned for cheaters dropping her items
[0:35:19] <$Niney_Who> @PeachSaliva Didn't Pat set a Password to stop you from getting invaded?
[0:35:19] <tau_psi_pi> setting up dark souls co-op is hell
[0:35:21] <+marsantas> Paige has cheat weapons people dropped her
[0:35:22] <$Solidnick18> maybe
[0:35:23] <ThighsSupreme> Name engraved ring?
[0:35:25] <+zamatermort> Paige, check if you have a password set
[0:35:26] <Sheepeze> isn't there a ring for this purpose
[0:35:27] <DeniedPants> isn't there a password system for summoning or was that 3
[0:35:30] <+marsantas> So she is almost certainly soft banned
[0:35:32] <%Lunarhawk> just have paige check if shes banned

[0:35:52] <+Mendin> Paige you don't have cheat items, you just have stacks of normal items that were maybe cheated in
[0:35:58] <+PleasantLee> Paige could check the Majula statue and see if the death number is the same as Plagues Majula statue death number
[0:35:59] <freelancebabymaker> go to majula i guess?
[0:36:00] <destinyspider> Paige, can you ask Plague why he is attempting to convert the common populus into furries?
[0:36:02] <+marsantas> Just play, he'll get in or not
[0:36:09] <DatAsuna> Nobdy a frmsoft is bothering to ban peple from DS2 in 2020
[0:36:10] <+Invlux> Well, Paige CAN be invaded and stuff

[0:54:17] <+ragingbrachy> i would help you paige
[0:54:17] <KoyaMusa> datasuna is a bit character anyways
[0:54:18] <+JenovasPuppet> Eli would help from the shadows to make Paige think she did it herself
[0:54:25] <$Niney_Who> Plague would run ahead, aggro everything, andl eave
[0:54:25] <+Sir_Gawain_Lotsson> @laserbeaming I don't think DS2 has finger
[0:54:30] <$shurtal> @peachsaliva Same thing happened to me! only it was my nose, and he did it til I bled. I looked like Rudolph for a week
[0:54:37] <@SoFarFetched> @studleydoorite even if she had her eyes open like in that one Scene of Clockwork Orange,she'd somehow still not see things LUL
[0:54:37] <%RedMageRebel> that could be said of many things paige
[0:54:38] <%Joustar_> Cat love is pain
[0:54:38] <+ragingbrachy> now pat has the toxoplasmosis
[0:54:38] <+Remery_> cats and their tongue spikes

[0:57:45] <%Erisianmisfit> Erisianmisfit subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 38 months! 
[0:57:45] <%RedMageRebel> Being bi in a gay bar is interesting cause some like you and others think you arent gay enough
[0:57:46] <+Promessa_EX> Let’s start a war
[0:57:46] <+Sir_Gawain_Lotsson> I only go to bars that have good borgar
[0:57:47] <%Royalguard22> Better question: Have we been in a gay bar knowingly?
[0:57:48] <+TopTieramisu> there are gay spas?
[0:57:49] <SaiyanShoto> I haven't but I don't go to bars
[0:57:50] <indig0bird> @emperordread I dunno, tellme when

[0:58:05] <Monkeyweed21> do spas exist anymore
[0:58:07] <JonKhan> WHy did they put a dragon rider here, answering this leads down dark paths....
[0:58:09] <SaiyanShoto> He want's to keep his orb untouched
[0:58:10] <$Sphincter_Spelunker> I know a gay bar that started to put a pride flag outside because there were too many biker types going at first
[0:58:10] <indig0bird> It's REALLY obvious
[0:58:13] <%Keyd00d> yeah all the gay guys
[0:58:14] <+Remery_> yea theres so many cocks
[0:58:16] <+Schrodingers_Box> Have you been to a Gay Steelmill?
[0:58:16] <@SoFarFetched> I mean,gay bars are REALLY upfront on them being a gay bar.
[0:58:17] <%RedMageRebel> ever been to an asian spa? ;)
[0:58:17] <+UrielCobalt> this stream is a gay bar
[0:58:18] <Darkfire346> I live in a place where if there was a gay bar, let's just say it would be burned down within a week....
[0:58:19] <SaiyanShoto> Like Homer
[0:58:19] <Mister_McDerp> it's super obvious
[0:58:20] <%Joustar_> you'd know.
[0:58:21] <indig0bird> There's literally no way of not knowing
[0:58:22] <+UrielCobalt> mind blown
[0:58:23] <GarbageQueenEllie> Gay bars are obvious. They're all bears on unicycles
[0:58:24] <%Keyd00d> all the penises
[0:58:27] <+Invlux> Hey wait a minute... this Lesbian bar doesn't have fire exits!
[0:58:28] <dariusclover> I want to go to a nice gay bar but there are not many around me
[0:58:28] <+marsantas> Yeah is the server a guy in only hotpants? gay bar
[0:58:28] <%2017y> gEnErALiZeD LoOk
[0:58:29] <cosmicgoatee> id like to imagine the rainbow flags inside were a dead giveaway

[0:58:33] <+Noelle_of_the_Nova> I'm gay and I've never been to a gay bar.
[0:58:34] <Coystick> Lesbian bars aren't gay bars
[0:58:34] <+Mendin> Does Paige's Stream Is The Gay Bar?!????
[0:58:36] <SGrim> @PeachSaliva so my local comic book store might be a gay bar?
[0:58:37] <Monkeyweed21> paige why
[0:58:38] <%Lunarhawk> why does paige run 95% of the way to the door and then not look at it
[0:58:40] <+jiggy_snipe> she liked being hit on by girls for once?
[0:58:41] <Profmcstevie> Bro all these dudes are kissing each other.....must be a full moon or something, not a gay bar bepSlain
[0:58:43] <Coystick> I WONDER
[0:58:45] <indig0bird> Think about the coolest bar you know, it's cooler than that
[0:58:47] <+PleasantLee> does Paige is the lesbian bar?
[0:58:47] <$DesertPenguin> The name of the bar usually gives it away
[0:58:49] <%FacetiousAF> drag shows are fun
[0:58:49] <%Piemono> Everyone likes Sausage
[0:58:49] <$SvenHolgersson> Cuz bros are easier to fuck
[0:58:49] <Coystick> Fuck for fuck's sake I wonder
[0:58:50] <%2017y> They're the same bar, pat.
[0:58:50] <buckwheat70> The trans bars is Korea are pretty awesome too.
[0:58:52] <+TopTieramisu> gay guys like to dance more?
[0:58:53] <GarbageQueenEllie> Because there's a song about gay bars
[0:58:54] <+Schrodingers_Box> Because Gays Party Harder
[0:58:54] <+ragingbrachy> yo
[0:58:55] <+Scevda> “Eli, why did you bring me to an gay undead burg?”
[0:58:56] <+loukemia83> gay dudes want to fuck
[0:58:56] <+necrocannibal2> GAY DUDES ARE HORNY
[0:59:00] <cosmicgoatee> because Lesbian bars are coffee shops
[0:59:01] <$Afterman_> men can go out at night without fear of being attacked
[0:59:01] <+marsantas> Because lesbian bars are more new
[0:59:03] <Coystick> Because guys FUCK
[0:59:03] <$SvenHolgersson> Dudes hornry

[1:24:30] <skyentombment> I remember once while going through Dragonkin Mausoleum, I was summoned to fight the Nameless king with other 3 dudes, but instead we just did the jerkoff motion with the shield while a caster clapped next to us
[1:24:30] <%Royalguard22> Time for grinding?
[1:24:32] <+Creggamonsta> does she have a better now?
[1:24:33] <Cryomancer_Maurice> One of the best weapons in the game is here.
[1:24:35] <+cdrom321> @Darkfire346 Pat said that they were going to skip certain ass-kicking optional portions of the game. He only specifically mentioned Darklurker, but I'm assuming that the three DLC challenge bosses are included.
[1:24:35] <ShichiNoBushi> Bad Man. Aaaaa-aaaaaah!
[1:24:40] <zaitje> the bad man returns

[3:03:01] <%Erisianmisfit> 2011 is when Bangarang came out
[3:03:04] <+blazecc> Little Paige? That was 2011
[3:03:05] <@SoFarFetched> @CommanderSqueaks pretty sure it was also used in AMVs
[3:03:10] <ShichiNoBushi> All the music videos from Daft Punk's Discovery album compose the anime movie Interstella 5555.

[4:01:38] <JetpackMcQuack> cyr5Head
[4:01:41] <+velemi> no it actually would make you die faster
[4:01:41] <JeedyJay> Mutant powers are just magic
[4:01:41] <+ALazo> Wolverine already breaks it by existing
[4:01:43] <Madbearv> mutants don't follow rules plague
[4:01:44] <+jiggy_snipe> he breaks rules
[4:01:44] <%Keyd00d> plague it's a comic
[4:01:46] <+RealThiele> he spend energy to regrow
[4:01:46] <+Scevda> Meat dimension
[4:01:48] <Shonen_hero> well he already does that
[4:01:48] <Laecerelius> Wolverine regenerates because his meat comes from the meat dimension
[4:01:49] <+ragingbrachy> yes
[4:01:50] <%AncelDeLambert> NO
[4:01:52] <+jiggy_snipe> yes
[4:01:53] <Laecerelius> I think tha tmight be real
[4:01:53] <zamzoph> Isn't there a Steven King story about self-cannibalism or something like that?
[4:01:54] <+JellyMat> regenerating costs energy

[4:02:07] <srkAres> LUL
[4:02:08] <Shonen_hero> he just makes mass out of nothing all the time
[4:02:09] <boywunderkind> The energy he would have to exhume to regenerate..
[4:02:09] <+TopTieramisu> adenosine triphosphate
[4:02:09] <TerryTheTurret> There's characters who can create fire and ice and lasers out of nowhere and he's worried about that..
[4:02:10] <TheAmazingClaytor> In this house we obey the laws of THERMODYNAMICS
[4:02:12] <+Jaysky> His magic healing factor means he's healthy

[4:02:21] <SGrim> Paige faked her way through too many science courses to be expected to know this.
[4:02:22] <%CommanderSqueaks> Peach is a pinnacle of the wonder of the American education system (says the Californian)
[4:02:22] <%Erisianmisfit> I mean how does Cyclops generate the energy for his beams?
[4:02:25] <%MaddyCaddy> Does Wolverine create energy?

[4:02:29] <%rdark_ksu> hes also like 200 years old
[4:02:30] <SymphonicMetalCitadel> What if it's the meat whale from Torchwood
[4:02:30] <%velemi> cutting off your flesh causes you to lose more energy than you could get back by consuming it
[4:02:32] <%Keyd00d> with a magic plan
[4:02:35] <%AncelDeLambert> this is why it's possible for Raiden to eventually beat Armstrong: he runs out of energy to heal with
