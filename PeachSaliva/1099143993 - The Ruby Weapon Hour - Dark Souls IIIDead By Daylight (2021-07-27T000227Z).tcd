[0:14:45] <$Sphincter_Spelunker> you said you used a new oil tho
[0:14:47] <Prism_Wing> All of oil

[0:14:57] <%Marzby> Hello today Paige!

[0:15:07] <%tizz86> yo creep-po
[0:15:08] <ididstuff666x> I cant imagine a life without lemon pepper
[0:15:12] <%Ziegsy> My doggo had an allergy test ;; shes super allergic to grass
[0:15:13] <%ssjklyco> Avocado make alot of people itchy but nothing life threatening

[0:15:30] <+heyalright107> irithyll dungeon
[0:15:31] <Monkeyweed21> the bad place full of mean ladies
[0:15:33] <BigFingerRo> Oh this is the BEST mindset to be in
[0:15:34] <@CreepyPorpoise> It might be that the new oil you're using isn't actually olive, its just being passed off as olive oil. Theres a whole like...scam around olive oil and a bunch of it isn't even actually olive, including some kinds in Italy.
[0:15:39] <+RyTYoung> I dunt
[0:15:39] <@PatStaresAt> @PeachSaliva im right here lol

[0:16:24] <ergulor> guter oil
[0:16:26] <+RealThiele> canola oil has an unfortunate alternate name
[0:16:29] <@PatStaresAt> Isn't it a straight right from the bonfire to the 2nd level?

[0:16:35] <Quilltaz> @Ziegsy aww poor kait, i hope you got some places she likes to go that isnt covered in green dirt stubble
[0:16:38] <Psyramics> canola is the alternate name
[0:16:39] <deefoursea> have you tried setting it to "W" for wumbo?
[0:16:46] <zhenthrim213> Canola oil is what Burger King fryers use
[0:16:46] <%nip_nips> @PatStaresAt she got the elevator shortcut to the fuckoff room yeah
[0:16:47] <Psyramics> it was renamed to canola to get away from the original name

[0:51:34] <Tampaoster> thats a GREAT hammer EEEEYYYYY
[0:51:42] <%Bt_Robot> Did Peach already do the big story thing for this area?
[0:51:44] <%WhereIsWill> nothing can beat unga
[0:51:44] <ohno778> Paige needs more women to murder
[0:51:54] <%Dakuu75> her default DS emotion is "Swing"
[0:51:58] <%patriotrenegade> no we're deliberately not doing it for a little bit

[0:53:05] <%patriotrenegade> no
[0:53:11] <Tampaoster> Eles precisar do moedinha!
[0:53:13] <%SveriSageAdvice> @PeachSaliva you'll be coming up on a boss door, but you'll want to explore the area a bit more

[0:53:38] <Sir_Gawain_Lotsson> "Woah, who killed all these women?"
[0:53:39] <%ElenaManetta> line your pockets
[0:53:42] <$Sphincter_Spelunker> she just noticed atpCap
[0:53:42] <+blademaster247> She just noticed
[0:53:43] <Coystick> This was Wolnir's pad
[0:53:43] <%Lion_kun> Take the weapon
[0:53:43] <%Bt_Robot> DO NOT DO BOSS YET, YOU STILL NEED TO DO BIG STORY
[0:53:44] <Hydrapissed> cause it means nothing now
[0:53:44] <ididstuff666x> Where IS Onion man?
[0:53:46] <blue8moon> no
[0:53:46] <%patriotrenegade> lore reasons
[0:53:47] <bevyrage> PAIGE NO
[0:53:48] <%holydeviant1> Gold, silver, bodies. You know, usual stuff
[0:53:49] <%SveriSageAdvice> do not go through boss door
[0:53:49] <%Lion_kun> Learn how to use it
[0:53:50] <blue8moon> NOOOOOOOOOOOOO
[0:53:50] <%cade_calrayn> PAIGE
[0:53:51] <%SveriSageAdvice> whew
[0:53:52] <SaltkeyAndAckfish> omg i can feel the internet power flow through me
[0:53:52] <CollinsOfBodom> NO
[0:53:53] <ohno778> NOOOOOOOOOO
[0:53:54] <breadwitchery> we call that "stylistic flair"
[0:53:54] <%patriotrenegade> @Bt_Robot we're doing a thing
[0:53:55] <%Garthunox> NOOOOOOOOOOO
[0:53:57] <freelancebabymaker> @PatStaresAt you might wanna be here for this
[0:53:58] <%Garthunox> NOOOOOOOOOO
[0:53:59] <+fetrigon> DESIST
[0:54:01] <PinoProxie> i m a g i n e
[0:54:03] <%GalacticaPhanto> We're trying to get her to get the weapon not fight the boss yet
[0:54:09] <SaltkeyAndAckfish> Kappa
[0:54:09] <+xen0riddley> OMG Peach, you avatar is so ADORABLE!
[0:54:10] <peachy996> rub up against the door to freak chat out
[0:54:10] <$Sphincter_Spelunker> to when you hoarded
[0:54:11] <%Dakuu75> WUT?! oh...
[0:54:14] <@SoFarFetched> nice sonic impression Kappa
[0:54:15] <%GalacticaPhanto> she can lose the fight
[0:54:15] <%superc37> trash tv?
[0:54:17] <$Sphincter_Spelunker> like a dragon
[0:54:18] <henshin2289> shut up just let her play game
[0:54:19] <+NWR_James> "To when I used to be a hoarder"
[0:54:21] <Void_The_Dark> @PatStaresAt if she goes to the boss I think she'll close off the Seigward quest line which I think will end Greirat's early as well.
[0:54:22] <%patriotrenegade> You guys actually think shell get the DeS reference and do it first try?
[0:54:23] <%Bt_Robot> YOU WANT TO MISS THE BEST SCENE IN THE GAME?
[0:54:24] <ohno778> CONCEPTUALIZE THE AROMA
[0:54:26] <PinoProxie> LUL
[0:54:26] <+MooseIsGoose> lol
[0:54:28] <jmboxchamp> theres gonna be 2 mimics
[0:54:30] <HaroldDonchee> part of my job is cleaning hoarder houses. it's amazing what you'll see
[0:54:41] <Hydrapissed> dead people
[0:54:45] <%TheWinged7> @PeachSaliva have you rescued onion knight from demon caves yet?
[0:54:45] <%Lion_kun> She should go in the door, grab the weapon and bone out so she can learn to use it and her buddy won't die like what happened in the best friends LP
[0:54:47] <BoneSkore> he got no face
[0:54:47] <Dave_VD> @GalacticaPhanto just let it play out at least once
[0:54:47] <%athuramn> @patriotrenegade LOL you're funny
[0:54:49] <%WhereIsWill> fuggin REKT omg
[0:54:50] <%cade_calrayn> god that hammer is OBSCENE
[0:54:51] <%JoshManVGH> My mother has been watching a LOT of long island medium.
[0:54:52] <+MooseIsGoose> Its that 420 dmg
[0:54:52] <%patriotrenegade> We're not gonna miss Siegward, we're guiding her to get the Storm Ruler first so Siegward doesnt die
[0:54:53] <peachy996> @patriotrenegade lolno and thats with all due respect to her
[0:55:00] <Tampaoster> HOLY SHIT SHES STRONK BOI
[0:55:00] <%CantWalkGood> such a gimmick boss
[0:55:05] <%ElenaManetta> THEY AREN'T HURTING ANYONE
[0:55:07] <DrkJP520> Are the conditions met for the cool thing here?
[0:55:08] <%GalacticaPhanto> @dave_vd Considering that's what Pat wants her to do then yes we do
[0:55:08] <%ElenaManetta> well now they are
[0:55:10] <%JoshManVGH> That was like a Nerdy Bart Simpson!
[0:55:12] <HeroToxiko> i remember cheesing the big bois by waking into the small hallway, but they would glitch in anyway
[0:55:12] <freelancebabymaker> does going in the boss room completely fuck the quest?
[0:55:13] <%CptCreampuff16> did she free onion bro yet?
[0:55:14] <+xen0riddley> you sound like a DBZ character when you talk like that
[0:55:16] <+treemanfour> They are cooked, so similar to a barbeque
[0:55:16] <%CantWalkGood> yhorm is the easiest in the game!
[0:55:16] <%Draylle> look at them shuffle
[0:55:19] <%Lion_kun> No she hasn't.
[0:55:19] <+MooseIsGoose> I hate how the walk
[0:55:24] <Coystick> That's right, run away from the wedding dresses
[0:55:29] <%patriotrenegade> pat couldnt figure out how toi use the storm ruler and Siegward died, she needs to know how to use it first
[0:55:35] <%Draylle> like an old lady that has to go to the bathroom
[0:55:36] <$Sphincter_Spelunker> atpShh
[0:55:39] <CollinsOfBodom> bridal shower ruined by big hammer
[0:55:40] <SpaceCapnCrone> something about utterly flattening people in those robes with a big hammer is oddly satisfying.
[0:55:42] <Ravioli_Ronin> SMASH THOSE LADIES Kappa
[0:55:46] <%Lion_kun> Using the weapon is not intuitive and needs practice, Pat let Onion Bro die because he didn't practice how to use it first.
[0:55:49] <danteftw20> they/'re wearing nicer boots than you, quick kill them!
[0:55:56] <Tampaoster> those 420s are the greatest thing of this night
[0:55:56] <%athuramn> oh if we're just straight up saying spoilers ._.
[0:56:02] <@PatStaresAt> I'm pretty sure grabbing the storm ruler and then coming back still triggers sieg
[0:56:03] <HeroToxiko> @SpaceCapnCrone *viking music starts playing*
[0:56:05] <PinoProxie> she loves killing the women
[0:56:08] <%BlackStarAura> WHERE THE WHITE WOMEN AT? Oh‚Ä¶
[0:56:09] <Hydrapissed> 420 damage
[0:56:09] <SaltkeyAndAckfish> damn paige be all like shabba ranks up in this
[0:56:11] <@PatStaresAt> doesn't it?
[0:56:14] <%Bt_Robot> IT DOES NOT
[0:56:15] <jmboxchamp> mimics
[0:56:16] <+NWR_James> every one of these women was pregnant
[0:56:17] <blue8moon> Last time I did the boss I barely got the weapon before bro died :(
[0:56:19] <%ThomasOfTroy> I thought it did
[0:56:21] <eco419> Noooo
[0:56:21] <%Lion_kun> It does because it's what Pat did in the best friends LP
[0:56:22] <jmboxchamp> both
[0:56:23] <%Draylle> swing away
[0:56:24] <%nip_nips> open both
[0:56:25] <$Sphincter_Spelunker> swing 1st
[0:56:27] <%patriotrenegade> you can grab the storm ruler and get out
[0:56:28] <Void_The_Dark> @PatStaresAt You trigger Seigward by helping him escape from his cell.
[0:56:30] <$Sphincter_Spelunker> ask later
[0:56:30] <Coystick> It's quite poetic that she's wearing Luci's armour. since they both have memory problems
[0:56:32] <Monkeyweed21> just swing
[0:56:33] <Sir_Gawain_Lotsson> tomatoBrain
[0:56:35] <%vVAstrAVv> check da chains
[0:56:35] <bevyrage> you did it paige
[0:56:39] <%Lion_kun> Woolie even said GOOD THING YOU DIDN'T KILL HIM
[0:56:40] <ididstuff666x> YES
[0:56:41] <%ThiccholasKappa> @NWR_James don't say that, she'll go sit at a bonfire just to kill them again
[0:56:41] <PinoProxie> bolth!
[0:56:42] <Sir_Gawain_Lotsson> brute smarts
[0:56:42] <%Draylle> he do a keek
[0:56:42] <femto216> They are friendly
[0:56:43] <Aydarkzero> wake them both up for fun times
[0:56:45] <Coystick> Get fucking kicked
[0:56:45] <HeroToxiko> tatsu
[0:56:46] <bevyrage> LUCKY
[0:56:47] <Hydrapissed> Dragon KICK
[0:56:47] <CollinsOfBodom> tatsumaki senpukyaku
[0:56:48] <%cade_calrayn> RIGHT TO THE FACE
[0:56:49] <%SveriSageAdvice> i am not sure, might be better to grab Sieg first, then grab the weapon and port out. Sieg doesnt die if you port out first @PatStaresAt
[0:56:50] <@MelBrooksKA> bolth mimics
[0:56:51] <eco419> Flying kicku
[0:56:53] <%WhereIsWill> tatsu to the dome!

[0:56:56] <Tampaoster> tatsumaki senpuu kyaku
[0:56:58] <Sir_Gawain_Lotsson> G L O R I O U S
[0:57:01] <%BlowFireThroatTotem> I wish mimics dis a sweet backflip
[0:57:03] <Hydrapissed> more hits before the get up
[0:57:04] <ohno778> There's more mimics than regular chests in this game i believe
[0:57:05] <+MooseIsGoose> There are 3 chests in this room
[0:57:06] <Void_The_Dark> @PatStaresAt If he's left in his cell then he can't save Greirat or come here.
[0:57:09] <OkamiDude15> Big and strong
[0:57:10] <%SveriSageAdvice> the triggers in DS3 for this questline are weird as shit
[0:57:15] <Hydrapissed> THE STAGGER
[0:57:19] <Monkeyweed21> fun fact:there are more mimics in DS3 than actual chests

[0:57:33] <Sir_Gawain_Lotsson> @Monkeyweed21 That has to be wrong
[0:57:36] <%vVAstrAVv> putting distance between u and mimics is a bad idea honestly
[0:57:36] <+doc_ock_rokc> DS memics are things of nightmares
[0:57:36] <freelancebabymaker> there she go

[0:57:47] <%patriotrenegade> Guys, she can go in, fight Yhorm, get the item and still get the thing later as long as she doesnt beat him
[0:57:47] <Tampaoster> its what they scream when they die
[0:57:49] <bevyrage> peach listening to the chest with her massive ears
[0:57:55] <Coystick> Did she actually go to the eye doctor?
[0:57:57] <Monkeyweed21> @Sir_Gawain_Lotsson its something like 18 mimics to 17 chests
[0:57:58] <%patriotrenegade> Ok boss time

[0:58:52] <%nip_nips> SPEND SOUL
[0:58:52] <blue8moon> up the tower
[0:58:52] <%BlowFireThroatTotem> DO they only have anime avatars, chat? Are there any prominent streamers that use an avatar that looks like a Jim Davis character?
[0:58:54] <%vVAstrAVv> probably
[0:58:54] <%Lion_kun> She should hit the bonfire first
[0:58:55] <%Bt_Robot> THE TOWER ONE
[0:58:55] <%SveriSageAdvice> there is a bonfire in the tower you came from
[0:58:58] <Sir_Gawain_Lotsson> the Bonfire with a Capital B, Paige
[0:59:00] <%king_wragles> rabble rabble rabble
[0:59:05] <+doc_ock_rokc> @PeachSaliva there is a bonfire in the tower you found the other bonfire at
[0:59:11] <Monkeyweed21> @bevyrage she needs to pick up storm ruler and learn how to use it or Sieg will die

[0:59:25] <$Sphincter_Spelunker> A muppet Vtuber would be cool
[0:59:26] <%patriotrenegade> They mean the bonfire you came from
[0:59:27] <%BlowFireThroatTotem> Is it v-tubing if it's on switch?
[0:59:29] <%GalacticaPhanto> Guys holy shit, as long as she doesn't kill boss she can grab item and peace out

[0:59:51] <Coystick> Bull shit
[0:59:52] <+RealThiele> RIP the name tucker
[0:59:52] <%Draylle> @BlowFireThroatTotem sounds like an untapped market, Vtubers can happen anywhere. it's a catch-all term
[0:59:54] <@SoFarFetched> Theres literally a vtuber category
[0:59:55] <eco419> Virtual tuber
[0:59:59] <%BlowFireThroatTotem> I just want a v-tuber that looks like Jon Arbuckle

[1:00:04] <+OldDarkwraith> Go back the way you came, a bonfire will be at the top of a ladder.
[1:00:05] <RetroCop87> souls fans continue the tradition of being shitty twitch watchers
[1:00:08] <Coystick> Oni-chan greatarrow
[1:00:09] <Sir_Gawain_Lotsson> It is impressive that Paige has not fallen off a cliff
[1:00:11] <%amymist> i saw a vtuber with a really unusual design a while ago, but i dont remember who they were
[1:00:21] <%Bt_Robot> DO NOT LISTEN TO HIM
[1:00:24] <eco419> Oh my god yes
[1:00:24] <%SveriSageAdvice> climb up the ladder, and look around for a ladder that goes higher
[1:00:28] <%king_wragles> @amymist Bahroo?
[1:00:35] <%Bt_Robot> HE IS TRYING TO DEPRIVE YOU OF STORY
[1:00:39] <+RealThiele> he came all the way upstairs to say he was right

[1:00:53] <Aydarkzero> oh right Paige has her own streaming room
[1:00:54] <freelancebabymaker> god this sidequest is obtuse as shit
[1:00:55] <Monkeyweed21> next to you
[1:01:00] <%BlowFireThroatTotem> Pat's available, chat rgtSmile
[1:01:02] <Spydurman> did Pat find the D.Z Sword?
[1:01:06] <ohno778> ladder man
[1:01:08] <$Sphincter_Spelunker> virtual Youtuber. That's what V-tuber stands for. ü§î
[1:01:09] <Sir_Gawain_Lotsson> @eco419 "You idiots, we're ALL backseating!"
[1:01:12] <$Sphincter_Spelunker> I hate it
[1:01:14] <+MooseIsGoose> This side quest is ridiculous
[1:01:21] <+RealThiele> LUL
[1:01:26] <Ravioli_Ronin> All the DS side quests are obtuse af LUL
[1:01:30] <+fetrigon> walkin aboot
[1:01:33] <%AncelDeLambert> alright, I'm late, has she gotten anywhere in the Profaned Capitol?
[1:01:38] <+Etherealizer> but what if the poochie was the one walking him the entire time, think about it
[1:01:45] <Sir_Gawain_Lotsson> This is a bus and Paige is not a licensed bus driver in our school district LUL
[1:01:46] <blue8moon> you got stuff you can turn in too
[1:01:48] <%king_wragles> @AncelDeLambert kinda
[1:01:49] <%Bluwizard21> I thought peach put on a princess voice and said welcome home just there
[1:01:49] <%GalacticaPhanto> As long as the boss isn't beat and she grabs the item she can't mess up the questline
[1:01:58] <Zakaraz> it has been a treat to see you streaming more often
[1:02:13] <%Lion_kun> Paige should hit the boss room. Grab the sword. Bone out and then explore the rest of the zone.
[1:02:16] <%patriotrenegade> @PeachSaliva I think Pat wants you to go fight the boss and grab the item in the room at the same time
[1:02:16] <%ThomasOfTroy> Clippers be ready
[1:02:23] <$shurtal> you have an estus shard
[1:02:23] <@SoFarFetched> "Would you like a Bath,Dinner,or.......ME??"

[1:02:26] <+Mumbles519> you have an estus shard you haven't given to andre
[1:02:28] <Hydrapissed> can sell souls to see amount
[1:02:29] <%patriotrenegade> probably not
[1:02:29] <+blademaster247> You should greet Pat in a Grimace costume
[1:02:29] <%nip_nips> USE SHARD
[1:02:31] <Sir_Gawain_Lotsson> @SoFarFetched oh god
[1:02:33] <fruit_pie_the_magician> Pat leaves?

[1:02:39] <Coystick> Man if I can get me wife willing to to talk like the Firekeeper for me, life won
[1:02:40] <%Draylle> "Welcome home, Patrick. What is it you desire?"
[1:02:42] <%vVAstrAVv> you can sell soul items to merchants for exactly as much as they give you.
[1:02:42] <Monkeyweed21> talk to andre
[1:02:42] <%BlowFireThroatTotem> You could put on yer trash hat and say welcome home like a homeless person.
[1:02:44] <%Bt_Robot> ANDRE

[1:08:35] <President_Pariah> Paige, IMO, you need to stop caring about losing souls less than ~2 levels worth, dropping 15k souls at this point isn't going to effect you much and each level up has VERY small impact
[1:08:36] <%Lion_kun> Pat, in your LP, you fought Yhorm l, died, then freed Sieg

[2:16:56] <+cdrom321> @TheZearGuy I think they've talked about when she fought Orphan, so I think so.
[2:16:57] <morningmoondude> Paige laser focused on that ass
[2:16:58] <Monkeyweed21> @Hozak oh yeah she's like 60% of the way to becoming one of those big dog monsters from Irithyll
[2:16:58] <luftraumm1> a giant woman
[2:17:10] <easy_bot_mason> She can get the armor but she'll never have the booty

[2:17:41] <$Sphincter_Spelunker> BOP
[2:17:46] <%ComfortableStranger> vampire fox Paige always has blood on the mind
[2:17:46] <+CatastropheCorvid> Dancer's strength is making people panic roll. You don't need to roll quite as much as you are. Doing bloody fantastic though.
[2:17:47] <JobbedBone> half lady, half ferret
[2:17:48] <+realm_forge> Think of her as a really pissed off jennifer lopez
[2:17:49] <+doc_ock_rokc> @PeachSaliva remember the dancer is a woman and then you can kill her easily
[2:17:50] <Tampaoster> its getting your blood born? what the actual fuck paige
[2:17:53] <peachy996> It's like Mergo's Wet Nurse in looks and vibe but it feels more like dodging Laurence and his crazy swings
[2:17:54] <CollinsOfBodom> paige is gettin porked up
[2:17:57] <+Dives__> We all horny for Dancer
[2:17:59] <%Shion963> we all are tbh

[2:23:36] <+cdrom321> Pat would totally be Vordt. That means that Paige would be the dancer.
[2:23:44] <HotSauceFiend> i do like that the environment also takes fire damage
[2:23:47] <Darkfire346> @user_naim fuck that bird.
[2:23:56] <user_naim> @darkfire346 exactly

[2:24:29] <AxelCezar> dancer is legit a great fight, pure skill no gimmick
[2:24:29] <%ClericOfSparda> I like dancer a lot more when I'm not fighting her
[2:24:30] <%3d_pbandj> your first fight went the best...???
[2:24:31] <luftraumm1> might be a good idea to ember up?
[2:24:32] <+doc_ock_rokc> Covid paige

[2:24:38] <%Lion_kun> smoked too much cigs
[2:24:40] <%geekjacob> dont breath the water
[2:24:41] <Sir_Gawain_Lotsson> Here lies Paige Boivin, slain by a bottle of water
[2:24:42] <%nip_nips> @3d_pbandj as is typical of souls bosses
[2:24:47] <%Shion963> chokeslammed through the screen
[2:24:48] <renyrells> i literally just clicked on the stream and paige is dying
[2:24:49] <$AzureGale> As long as you're not choking while fighting the boss
[2:24:50] <$Sphincter_Spelunker> don't inhale liquid just cuz you're thirsty for tall lady
[2:24:51] <%Agami23> paige, you are sounding like me after every round i have of guilty gear.
[2:24:52] <+MrATheGreat> That's some goooooood weed
[2:24:53] <%Dakuu75> spicey soup
[2:24:53] <+cdrom321> @user_naim Right? Vordt's super short because he stays low to the ground.
[2:24:56] <%ElkRiverDog> Choking....on your THIRST!
[2:24:59] <user_naim> Getting this close to TOS violations with this boss
[2:25:04] <CrimsonFox777> Paige, we know you want to be a skeleton, but stay alive!
[2:25:05] <BigFingerRo> @3d_pbandj Tends to happen with DS, your first attempts are full of adrenaline and no frustration
[2:25:06] <+D00msDayDan> what will kill her first, the dancer or her own throat
[2:25:10] <Dr_Mooose> oh
[2:25:10] <$AzureGale> Let me in! LET ME IIIIIN!
[2:25:11] <+MisterAvry> yerg
[2:25:11] <BigFingerRo> WHAAAAAAAA
[2:25:13] <HotSauceFiend> how long was that?
[2:25:14] <wasdsf> all that for nothing lol
[2:25:14] <Sir_Gawain_Lotsson> double choking
[2:25:14] <Monkeyweed21> Fun fact: the Dancer has a fancy veil because she used to be a princess
[2:25:14] <%ElkRiverDog> Seriously, don't die tho
[2:25:16] <HotSauceFiend> 2 seconds?
[2:25:19] <renyrells> now she's dying in the game too
[2:25:20] <morningmoondude> I TURNED AWAY FOR ONE SECOND AND IT'S OVER?
[2:25:20] <+doc_ock_rokc> @Sir_Gawain_Lotsson thousnads of people die every year to choking on water

[2:25:20] <$AzureGale> 10/10
[2:25:21] <biomegabear> I like that vtuber peach isn't over designed
[2:25:25] <user_naim> @cdrom321 ‚ÄùNever far from the fleeting Streamer‚Äù
[2:25:26] <President_Pariah> Paige, watch her sword hand, stay away from it, or behind it
[2:25:28] <%MechArch> the pre nut
[2:25:30] <Sir_Gawain_Lotsson> @doc_ock_rokc I believe it
[2:25:32] <+Ches_Neckbeard> dancer lady doesn't look pregnant so Paige can't kill her
[2:25:33] <CelestialCage> HOHOOOH
[2:25:33] <%Dakuu75> lol
[2:25:34] <+Caidezes> She's already taken by Vordt.
[2:25:35] <leargo> XD

[2:25:43] <%BlackStarAura> Premature annihilation
[2:25:44] <morningmoondude> Quickshot Paige
[2:25:46] <luftraumm1> vtubers are way too much, paige's is classy
[2:25:46] <SiriusLeeLost> has she considered changing to huger armor???
[2:25:52] <+blastyoboots> @Caidezes wasn't Vordt her brother
[2:25:52] <Sir_Gawain_Lotsson> @Caidezes Paige already took Bort and compressed his soul into a big stick
[2:25:53] <$Sphincter_Spelunker> bodying dancers in bed
[2:25:59] <Hydrapissed> vodt was her husband
[2:25:59] <+cdrom321> @user_naim How do we summon artists for this?
[2:26:09] <inorwise> her animations are so cool, theres a reason they used her for the demo
[2:26:17] <JobbedBone> we need to make sure the tent is big enough for large mommy gf with etherial veil
[2:26:18] <lexitheshark> Clever girl
[2:26:27] <%MightyDuckShoes> "Play this game and you'll go hollow in 45 seconds"
[2:26:36] <freelancebabymaker> @peachsaliva hey fun theory this boss MIGHT be like gwyneveres daughter or something
[2:26:39] <+MisterAvry> the big flowing veil on her is such a cool effect
[2:26:40] <+doc_ock_rokc> @cdrom321 \\`[T] // I am here
[2:26:43] <+TheotherKristian> Dancer too hot for p[aige
[2:26:56] <Hydrapissed> DRY
[2:26:56] <%MightyDuckShoes> sipsipGasm
[2:26:57] <%nip_nips> paige focusing, but not on the fight
[2:27:05] <%MechArch> need to do it raw
[2:27:06] <%BlackStarAura> MOIST
[2:27:10] <+MisterAvry> naw go in raw
[2:27:14] <freelancebabymaker> i think you have a shitload of them so
[2:27:15] <%Lion_kun> 25% health helps but it depnds on how many emebrs you have
[2:27:15] <%nip_nips> do it RAW
[2:27:19] <Darkfire346> embers can be farmed, so dealers choice
[2:27:20] <Monkeyweed21> If you pay attention you can see the Dancer setting the stage on fire with her sword
[2:27:20] <+Kyma1020> GOTTA DO IT RAW
[2:27:21] <maskedmook> "I could ember but I WANT her to kill me"
[2:27:23] <lexitheshark> Embering might give you a better health buffer, but you can do it raw
[2:27:26] <+cdrom321> @doc_ock_rokc Pat is Vordt. Paige is Dancer. Good?
[2:27:26] <+MisterAvry> oh baby we like it rawww
[2:27:35] <GarbageQueenEllie> Aurora Borealis?
[2:27:42] <lexitheshark> In this time of day
[2:27:46] <Hydrapissed> pat greyrat paige dancer
[2:27:46] <EuropanLamprey> you can buy her armor when you win and it's good for.its w3ight
[2:27:49] <+doc_ock_rokc> @cdrom321 yeah just figuring out hwo to do it
[2:27:56] <+gg_aleph> located entirely within your gown?
[2:27:57] <Quilltaz> Embering up for dancer is just you bringing roses for your date
[2:27:57] <Hozak> Aurora Australis since Paige is so close to the dancer's bottom.
[2:27:58] <Sir_Gawain_Lotsson> one swing from neutral is safe
[2:27:59] <+MisterAvry> good thing you healed
[2:28:08] <$AzureGale> NOT DED
[2:28:18] <%BlackStarAura> Ass-less chaps
[2:28:23] <%Agami23> i found a single fanfiction for dancer online
[2:28:25] <+cdrom321> @doc_ock_rokc No expectations. Perfectly up to you.
[2:28:30] <%MightyDuckShoes> Considering Vordt and the lack of protection on that ass, I would assume they were partial to doggy. psaDogchamp
[2:28:36] <%nip_nips> @Agami23 we must make more
[2:28:41] <+MisterAvry> all chaps are assless, otherwise they'd be pants
[2:28:42] <CelestialCage> TWO
[2:28:46] <+Caidezes> Vordt got pegged.
[2:28:49] <$Sphincter_Spelunker> speen

[2:29:12] <%Agami23> @nip_nips exactly
[2:29:17] <Darkfire346> for some reason during this and Vordts fights all i can think of is the Frosty the Snowman theme song.....
[2:29:18] <Monkeyweed21> @Agami23 you need to look for the ironic meme comics with super detailed drawings of her butt
[2:29:31] <JobbedBone> diablo 2 barbarian meta
[2:29:40] <+doc_ock_rokc> @Darkfire346 Why must you curse me so
[2:29:45] <%nip_nips> is this the run?
[2:29:49] <+MisterAvry> scoop

[2:30:01] <%ClericOfSparda> @MisterAvry Don't jinx it!
[2:30:02] <+blastyoboots> you're using Vordt's hammer, so how messed up slash fitting is it that you're swinging her partner's dick into her
[2:30:03] <%Lion_kun> you keep rolling too early
[2:30:03] <MyNameIsRasus> @nip_nips jinxed it
[2:30:05] <%Bt_Robot> SHE GOT THAT THIGH GAP, IT'S VERY DISTRACTING
[2:30:05] <President_Pariah> you can also unlock her Swords
[2:30:05] <peachy996> the echoey footsteps really make this boss
[2:30:06] <+RevolverOcelot16> so so close
[2:30:06] <%Lion_kun> or too late

[2:30:13] <TheAntiNihilist> attack its back
[2:30:14] <Dr_Mooose> he did it!?
[2:30:15] <MyNameIsRasus> what a hero
[2:30:17] <+doc_ock_rokc> @cdrom321 the tbf subreddit
[2:30:17] <maskedmook> You got this in soon
[2:30:18] <Darkfire346> @doc_ock_rokc were all cursed, brother
[2:30:18] <%Lion_kun> and rolling too much
[2:30:19] <inorwise> ?????
[2:30:19] <GarbageQueenEllie> ew egg
[2:30:21] <%MightyDuckShoes> What? Ross?
[2:30:22] <+MisterAvry> what? who ate eggs?
[2:30:23] <Sir_Gawain_Lotsson> Paige is so focused on the dancer's ass that she can't look at the swords LUL
[2:30:24] <%Bt_Robot> WHY DID THEY GIVE HER YOGA PANTS?
[2:30:27] <MyNameIsRasus> the virgin endwalker vs the chad eggeater
[2:30:28] <+fromnibelheim> he really looked like he was starting to break at the end bless him
[2:30:30] <+Ches_Neckbeard> did someone accomplish what smashmouth couldn't?
[2:30:31] <$AzureGale> Wow, it sounded like Paige's "yay" was echoing there :x
[2:30:33] <%YakumoYomi> Paige beat Ebrietas in one try. I want you all to remember that.
[2:30:39] <%MechArch> gotta dance
[2:30:43] <$Puhff> NO FUN
[2:30:43] <%BlackStarAura> Even the screams of pain are hentai-like
[2:30:45] <%patriotrenegade> @PeachSaliva Eli hates this boss
[2:30:47] <+cdrom321> @doc_ock_rokc I'm so glad that subreddit is still alive.
[2:30:48] <%Agami23> @MisterAvry a streamer named rubberninjaross ate thousands of eggs in ff14 for a stream
[2:30:49] <%Nkbzodiac> not rolling enough
[2:30:53] <%Lion_kun> Paige did not beat Ebrietas in one try lol
[2:30:56] <%patriotrenegade> He thinks she's too "much"
[2:30:56] <%Rumbutt> Her grab is actually a cone, so if you get close to her and roll to your right you can dodge much easier
[2:31:00] <+blademaster247> Why are you fighting these scrubs?
[2:31:02] <$Sphincter_Spelunker> @YakumoYomi it was multiple tries. the winning one just took less than 50 secs
[2:31:02] <%Lion_kun> She beat her in under 3 mintues but it was not her first try
[2:31:08] <MyNameIsRasus> she did beat ebrietas in 2 minutes tho
[2:31:09] <+MisterAvry> @Agami23 oh that Ross, awesome
[2:31:21] <$Sphincter_Spelunker> mins whatever
[2:31:30] <ToneBacas> Dancer moves so slow but when she gets going, she won't stop spinning
[2:31:31] <Darkfire346> he ate how many eggs?! this dude about to shit out a bathtub
[2:31:33] <%MightyDuckShoes> So his character ate the eggs or...
[2:31:38] <%YakumoYomi> @Sphincter_Spelunker Was it? I thought it was her first attempt. My mistake.
[2:31:39] <%patriotrenegade> @MyNameIsRasus we're still unsure as to whether it was a fluke or not
[2:31:43] <%hewlettfan96> This guy looks agonising
[2:31:44] <%nip_nips> her moves are so fluid its hard to tell when it ends and another string begins
[2:31:51] <+fromnibelheim> he ate over 140k eggs I think?
[2:31:53] <%Agami23> i love the detail of the arena catching on fire when she swings at it
[2:31:56] <Sir_Gawain_Lotsson> Did Paige ever fight the tigers in DS2?
[2:32:02] <%rumtumtugnutz> @darkfire346 he ate 138000 eggs in ffxiv
[2:32:02] <$Sphincter_Spelunker> ff14 egg eating, yes
[2:32:03] <%cade_calrayn> Nope
[2:32:09] <$pretendofriendo> she has weird rymth to the timing of her attacks different from the other bosses
[2:32:12] <%cade_calrayn> She got out to the tundra and that's it
[2:32:14] <MyNameIsRasus> did paige ever fight orphan in bb?
[2:32:15] <@SoFarFetched> @Sir_Gawain_Lotsson no she never did the DLC cause everyone said dont bother
[2:32:17] <femto216> This was the only boss I was so satisfied to beat since I'm shield guy and I beat it without one and in 4 tries
[2:32:28] <%Draylle> @MyNameIsRasus she did it first try
[2:32:29] <Darkfire346> @rumtumtugnutz ......why?!
[2:32:32] <$Sphincter_Spelunker> Paige beat all of Bloodborne, Orphan included
[2:32:32] <Sir_Gawain_Lotsson> @SoFarFetched Dude the Tigers have the most fucked up boss run of all time
[2:32:34] <MyNameIsRasus> oh my god
[2:32:42] <amused_platypus> paige has a 10% damage boost against woman
[2:32:43] <ToneBacas> imagine fighting Dancer right at the start of the game when you first get to this room
[2:32:50] <GarbageQueenEllie> Dance, Queen, daaaance
[2:32:55] <%EyeFarted> Wait, is she R2ing to start?
[2:33:03] <%Bt_Robot> I REMEMBER GOING INTO THIS FIGHT WITH 40 VIGOR AND STILL GETTING TWO SHOTTED
[2:33:10] <TheFramedWarlock> I beat this boss first try, I don't know why everyone finds her difficult
[2:33:12] <BigFingerRo> @ToneBacas You can, if you kill Emma
[2:33:13] <%rumtumtugnutz> @darkfire346 cause he ate 2000 eggs to celebrate Shadowbringers
[2:33:22] <eyeobject> YOU ARE THE DANCING QUEEN
[2:33:24] <$pretendofriendo> @bt_robot it do be distracting thou
[2:33:24] <%Lion_kun> Hey I just realized, isn't the Dancer based on Ciaran? Her weapons are giant versions of the tracers.
[2:33:27] <%Jack_of_No_Trades> Good attempt
[2:33:33] <+MrATheGreat> Yeah, Dancer's tough
[2:33:33] <Cory_the_Dinosaur> f
[2:33:35] <%Bt_Robot> YEAH, THOSE SPATS...
[2:33:39] <GarbageQueenEllie> You're doing really well, Peach. Proud of you
[2:33:42] <%rumtumtugnutz> And he‚Äôs Australian which must have something to do with it
[2:33:42] <%patriotrenegade> @PeachSaliva Paige, there isnt enough hate in your heart for this
[2:33:42] <+MrATheGreat> gotta learn those moves
[2:33:48] <Sir_Gawain_Lotsson> you almost demolished her first try, that's the fucked up part
[2:33:48] <TheZearGuy> She‚Äôs making you work for it
[2:33:49] <Monkeyweed21> FEEL THE BEAT OF THE TAMBORIINE
[2:33:50] <%patriotrenegade> You gotta HATE the boss!
[2:33:52] <Darkfire346> use tiddie power, gurl
[2:33:53] <+cdrom321> Might be easier.
[2:33:56] <%cade_calrayn> Yeah try embering
[2:33:56] <%ThomasOfTroy> May as well imo
[2:34:01] <TurtlesAndTentacles> You should not roll so much
[2:34:01] <MyNameIsRasus> too thicc to hate
[2:34:03] <alwayspronking> but she will die, as is tradition
[2:34:04] <CrimsonFox777> Your love for her is actually weakening you.
[2:34:04] <TheFramedWarlock> Use the ember in the fight for a full heal
[2:34:07] <%GalacticaPhanto> is it a good idea for her to go big swinging on her?
[2:34:11] <%nip_nips> paige dancer said papyrus is stinky
[2:34:11] <@Jekado> STUPID SEXY BOREAL DANCER
[2:34:12] <easy_bot_mason> get ANGY
[2:34:13] <+MisterAvry> this fight separates the dancing princesses from the dancing QUEENS
[2:34:14] <%Rumbutt> Peach throwing because she wants to see Dancer more
[2:34:16] <scrumbotime> Paige needs to become a misogynist, it's the only way to win
[2:34:20] <blue8moon> Just think of how cool you'll look in her outfit
[2:34:20] <amused_platypus> dancer of the boreal valley is girl bossing
[2:34:25] <GarbageQueenEllie> Bo'Real. Because you're worth it
[2:34:28] <Sir_Gawain_Lotsson> @GalacticaPhanto There is no option but big swing. It is the way.
[2:34:30] <+emperordread> She has that "swiggity swooty I'm comin for that booty" walk
[2:34:30] <%Jack_of_No_Trades> Just keep in mind that she COULD date all sorts of skeletons but chooses not to
[2:34:34] <easy_bot_mason> get angy at that stupidly nice booty
[2:34:35] <$Sphincter_Spelunker> @GarbageQueenEllie booooooo
[2:34:36] <Monkeyweed21> Lack of hate couldn't save Undine and dammit it wont save Dancer!
[2:34:41] <+TheMeromex> this is not my Saliva, but i support you in your endeavors either way
[2:34:41] <%hewlettfan96> How long exactly has she been hacking at this game??
[2:34:47] <%Agami23> @Lion_kun yeah they are, and i think theres a line about her being a descendent of the royal family, so likely related to kiaran
[2:34:48] <Hydrapissed> years
[2:34:51] <Darkfire346> I imagine the concept of this boss fight was another Biggie Smalls with Dancer and Vordt together
[2:34:54] <+cdrom321> @doc_ock_rokc Are you under the same name there?
[2:35:04] <dinnydanny777> I dislike dancer's breathing
[2:35:07] <dinnydanny777> it is creepy
[2:35:08] <%nip_nips> she just bitchslapped you
[2:35:08] <+MisterAvry> twice
[2:35:08] <Sir_Gawain_Lotsson> HOLY SHIT
[2:35:10] <Hydrapissed> how can she SLAP
[2:35:10] <Dr_Mooose> the disrespect
[2:35:11] <$Sphincter_Spelunker> @hewlettfan96 like a year, finally making progress in the last week tho
[2:35:11] <leargo> YES
[2:35:11] <%Lion_kun> I DID NOT KNOW SHE HAD A SLAP ATTACK
[2:35:14] <boomstickery> bitch slapped to death
[2:35:14] <%Draylle> now its personal
[2:35:15] <+CookieCutter007> what a queen
[2:35:17] <%parkslady> not the bitch slap!
[2:35:17] <Dr_Mooose> the 1 2
[2:35:18] <Hydrapissed> she has punches to lol
[2:35:18] <Sir_Gawain_Lotsson> THE CLEFAIRY DOUBLESLAP
[2:35:19] <MyNameIsRasus> oh the hate is coming
[2:35:19] <+MisterAvry> forth AND back
[2:35:20] <easy_bot_mason> SHE'S GETTING ABUSIVE
[2:35:20] <+ghostfaceninja_> with the pimp hand
[2:35:21] <%nip_nips> she said her eyes are UP HERE
[2:35:21] <%GalacticaPhanto> you're being too patient with her, just slap her
[2:35:22] <+NWR_James> what did the 5 fingers say to the face?

[2:35:37] <Cory_the_Dinosaur> coryth4Meow
[2:35:38] <+CapOfAllFools> Well, to be fair, she regular-slapped you, *then* bitch-slapped you.
[2:35:39] <MyNameIsRasus> HOW CAN SHE SLAP
[2:35:39] <%EyeFarted> She had to put you in your place

[2:35:52] <Hydrapissed> nah she dont she wants to kill people
[2:35:54] <$pretendofriendo> I'm sure you already know this but she has fundamentally different timing on her wind-ups and attacks and the rhythm of her attacks and the other bosses
[2:36:00] <%Bt_Robot> ALSO SHE TOLD ME YOUR HAIR LOOKS TERRIBLE
[2:36:26] <Profmcstevie> Let the hate come to you Paige, Dancer said MaoMao is cringe~
[2:36:26] <Darkfire346> imagine if she was as aggressive as vordt during her attacks...
[2:36:30] <Quilltaz> You‚Äôve datefighter her enough times for dancer to open up about her slapping fetishes, i see this as a big win
[2:36:56] <+dellakitty> lol
[2:36:56] <Cory_the_Dinosaur> did anybody mention you have her brother's hammer?
[2:36:56] <+cdrom321> I'll see you all next stream when she when she beats Dancer in one try.
[2:37:18] <femto216> Just follow your heart, Paige
[2:37:21] <%GalacticaPhanto> @cory_the_dinosaur Vordt isn't her brother
[2:37:23] <Darkfire346> Dancer thinks your vtuber avatar is the big dumb, use et

[2:42:29] <CollinsOfBodom> why bonk head when there's ass
[2:42:31] <luftraumm1> overhead strike?
[2:42:36] <Darkfire346> pretty sure you can crit paige by just Existing at her general direction
[2:42:48] <%nip_nips> good run so far
[2:42:49] <+MisterAvry> getting mostly butt shots so far
[2:42:52] <+YourRedDog> "I like your boot (but I'm not gay)" from the Aqua Teen movie would probably synch with this fight.
[2:42:56] <freelancebabymaker> @Darkfire346 if you just run by her really fast
[2:42:58] <%ClericOfSparda> Paige crits herself a lot
[2:43:01] <AthenaAegis> Nice dodge

[2:48:35] <pixelkingu> become dance queen
[2:48:35] <%Kenzo2000> I am proud of Paige now
[2:48:36] <easy_bot_mason> You can get her armor but you'll never have a booty like her
[2:48:38] <+MisterAvry> I showed up late but you did about as good as I did
[2:48:40] <Jaysky> Yeah the scarf on the armor is sick
[2:48:40] <%Rumbutt> you too can have a booty that will not quite
[2:48:41] <luftraumm1> best armour
[2:48:44] <zzNamttamzz> ORB is talking
[2:48:44] <MyNameIsRasus> Something tells me we're finishing this game in the dancer set
[2:48:45] <KeiganOfAstora> I missed so much. It was just yesterday that you were running aimlessly through Irithyll @PeachSaliva
[2:48:50] <$Puhff> her lore is sad too
[2:48:55] <pretendofriendo> dark
[2:48:59] <blue8moon> Let her enjoy the statue slitting it's throat LUL
[2:49:02] <+MrATheGreat> emo
[2:49:02] <GarbageQueenEllie> Oh no not the special sauce
[2:49:04] <ToneBacas> this rock bleeds. but how?
[2:49:05] <easy_bot_mason> dark like souls
[2:49:08] <%Sotetsu> All that for a 6 foot ladder
[2:49:14] <%thotbane> @Puhff She's supposed to be whatever the institutional descendant of a Lord's Blade is right?
[2:49:18] <Murphio_GS> Ladder
[2:49:19] <peachy996> clank
[2:49:19] <pretendofriendo> The Dark Blood of the souls of man
[2:49:20] <CollinsOfBodom> this ladder was brought to you by ragu
[2:49:20] <biglomix> thats the fire escape
[2:49:20] <Monkeyweed21> @PeachSaliva also the reason she has the fancy veil is cuz she's a princess
[2:49:22] <MyNameIsRasus> it's so stupid that it's for a ladder
[2:49:26] <%LysdexicAndVolingit> @Sotetsu that's at least 10 feet!
[2:49:27] <thebehatted> it's hard to believe, but that ladder is actually Anor Londo
[2:49:29] <+MisterAvry> a statue of a guy slitting his throat with a big sword is pretty fucking metal
[2:49:31] <Jaysky> Whoever said you can't get blood from a stone looks like an idiot now
[2:49:35] <user_naim> Fucking Spenser mansion shit
[2:49:39] <%BlackStarAura> SNAKE EATER
[2:49:47] <freelancebabymaker> @thotbane shes maybe like one of gwyneveres daughters

[2:52:39] <i_love_thicc_chicks> Like Demetra from Power Rangers Turbo?
[2:52:48] <heartlesshealer> @thotbane It's confusing because Zordon has a canon body in the Ooze movie

[2:53:07] <TheEndlessRiver1> Ludleth hung out because he was all on board, the others were not so agreeable
[2:53:08] <GarbageQueenEllie> Quickly, Paige! Restore the United States Congress!
[2:53:10] <Monkeyweed21> he's down to burn for eternity a SECOND time
[2:53:14] <dinnydanny777> I wonder what Ludleth did
[2:53:14] <Murphio_GS> DLC time?
[2:53:17] <%ClericOfSparda> LUL
[2:53:17] <%Mr_Pylon> Ludleth has the best quote in the series
[2:53:19] <easy_bot_mason> Ludleth is a lord amongst lords
[2:53:22] <TheEndlessRiver1> yes
[2:53:23] <lotharrio> He's the only one willing to follow through on what he should do, to keep the world going
[2:53:23] <TheEndlessRiver1> many people

[2:53:31] <Monkeyweed21> @PeachSaliva you can also get the Dancer's swords and dance like her
[2:53:35] <+MisterAvry> to google!

[2:53:56] <zzNamttamzz> Did Peach go the marriage route?
[2:54:03] <%Agami23> theres some sick cosplays, i found one fanfiction, and a assload of rule34

[2:54:31] <CollinsOfBodom> Did she ever go back to Yhorm
[2:54:32] <%ClericOfSparda> @Agami23 Good use of the word "assload"
[2:54:32] <lotharrio> Ludleth is just a shorter player character, basically. He only got as far as he did because he had some bullshit magic items.
[2:54:37] <Darkfire346> do the dragons count?
[2:54:40] <TheEndlessRiver1> Dancer is one of the toughest bosses
[2:54:41] <peachy996> hey can she get to the other gundyr? or is that for later?
[2:54:45] <%AncelDeLambert> she still needs to pick up Onion stuff in Yhorm's arena
[2:54:46] <%CantWalkGood> Storm King?

[3:11:39] <user_naim> The trick is meat. Meat saves every soup

[3:11:45] <JDRizzle316> bonk the old man

[3:12:02] <+Pharmakokinetic> ripostes are stronger than backstabs too
[3:12:02] <%BakiinPlaysStuff> I think Pat's mentioned that every stream of this game
[3:12:06] <heartlesshealer> well, if she was reading, then she couldn't listen

[3:16:48] <freelancebabymaker> @Monkeyweed21 and invisible and also maybe immortal?
[3:16:57] <$AzureGale> Time 4 panic pee
[3:16:59] <%hewlettfan96> YOU exist in entire state of Panic peach
[3:17:01] <%geekjacob> @Monkeyweed21 i thought it stoped after he kills it
[3:17:03] <Hydrapissed> can we like mod her game to wear it plays a loud honk noise when she can crit people
[3:17:18] <MoonlightWolves> Believe her panic goes "Oh balls... balls no!" micHA
[3:17:24] <Monkeyweed21> @freelancebabymaker its unclear whether the baby is invisible and he's holding it or if its a ghost and he's delusional, they leave it vague
[3:17:28] <Darkfire346> when gief time :(
[3:17:43] <%MarylandJutsu> more like when elmo time
[3:17:44] <+cdrom321> I'm back. Did she beat Blind Dragon Scrotum?
[3:17:48] <%cade_calrayn> I believe at one point they had a baby model in his arms but removed it because it was too graphic
[3:17:50] <Hydrapissed> @freelancebabymaker they also hint that the sun princess big booba ran off with the kid
[3:17:51] <Darkfire346> when Giefmo time
[3:17:51] <pretendofriendo> When on the piles of rubble around the stage, many of his attacks will miss the player, although he will still be in range of overhead slash attacks.
[3:17:53] <JobbedBone> its all the soup LUL
[3:17:57] <%thotbane> @rdark_ksu Good she should panic harder then. Disco is cool and I legit believe the efforts to kill disco were caused because disco had too many black and gay people for normie boomers
[3:18:01] <Monkeyweed21> @cdrom321 Mr. Crotch Tentacles remains alive
[3:18:05] <%MarylandJutsu> pretty much cade
[3:18:05] <freelancebabymaker> @Monkeyweed21 i heard a theory once that the baby noises are just him
[3:18:09] <%CantWalkGood> you can look up the original model with the actual baby, they thought it was to graphic because he crushes the baby in second phase
[3:18:13] <%thotbane> like at least in part, or subconsciously. In macro
[3:18:18] <+ghostfaceninja_> @cdrom321 she beat him, but then she decided not to LUL
[3:18:41] <%ItsRatman> Has Paige ever riposted in this playrhrough? Does she know what the sound cue is?
[3:18:42] <Hydrapissed> she had taht crit and just rolled away lol
[3:18:43] <JobbedBone> lance macdonald does cool rips
[3:18:48] <pretendofriendo> @cantwalkgood that fact ruined my day....
[3:18:50] <Hydrapissed> she doesnt not itsratman
[3:18:51] <Monkeyweed21> @freelancebabymaker thats also possible, again they leave it really vague if the baby is long gone and he's just crazy or if its just invisblessed
[3:18:55] <Sirius1xz> elevator has a short cut jump off
[3:19:07] <%geekjacob> wah
[3:19:07] <%ItsRatman> WAH

[3:19:15] <Monkeyweed21> drop off the elevator for a shortcut
[3:19:20] <%thotbane> @pretendofriendo FWIW the baby's already a dead baby when he's holding it, so he doesnt kill it. Why it cries? WHo knows its spookier that way
[3:19:29] <$AzureGale> Let's tako bout this
[3:19:37] <$AzureGale> Wait wrong line sorry
[3:19:45] <pretendofriendo> @thotbane that just makes it more sad
[3:19:46] <+MisterAvry> yeah what's halfway down the elevator?
[3:19:56] <KeiganOfAstora> There's another Estus Shard by the elevator if you jump off early @PeachSaliva
[3:19:58] <pretendofriendo> When on the piles of rubble around the stage, many of his attacks will miss the player, although he will still be in range of overhead slash attacks.
[3:20:32] <Monkeyweed21> @thotbane remember, death as a concept doesn't really apply to dragons so a half dragon child is gonna have some fucky shit
[3:20:32] <sirrice77> if you kill that greatsword knight you just dodged he drops a ring
[3:20:34] <dinnydanny777> Is that the Gorillaz laugh

[3:24:58] <JDRizzle316> failed
[3:24:58] <+AmanisHouseOfNonsense> Perfect!
[3:25:00] <KeiganOfAstora> It's a chunk?
[3:25:03] <+NWR_James> "I want that"
[3:25:04] <Monkeyweed21> For those curious: Oceiros is the old king of Lothric, after finding Seath's research on immortality he became obsessed with it to the point of fusing himself with dragon scales and making his youngest son Ocelot into a crossbreed like Priscilla
[3:25:06] <$AzureGale> nyannMegalul
[3:25:15] <%Draylle> this is just like real life, Paige hurting herself while trying to get something
[3:25:22] <TurtlesAndTentacles> Useless rolling is teaching you bad habits
[3:25:22] <JobbedBone> kill the last knight
[3:25:25] <ToneBacas> Britney Spears, why would you inflict Toxic upon us
[3:25:30] <+twohitgood> blooming purple

[3:25:45] <freelancebabymaker> nice
[3:25:46] <%nip_nips> thats one way to get rid of it
[3:25:46] <$Sphincter_Spelunker> that's how
[3:25:49] <%ReenMan350> or you can die that works too
[3:25:49] <%vivaciouseff> or divine blessing
[3:25:49] <%Ell1ot> there you go
[3:25:51] <BerryliciousDefinition> F
[3:25:53] <%juxtest> bonk
[3:25:54] <Murphio_GS> @Monkeyweed21 Though, according to some theories, Ocelot was never truly born

[3:25:56] <$AzureGale> nyannMegalul
[3:25:58] <tanarath> Purple moss, Paige

[3:26:20] <$Sphincter_Spelunker> SourPls atpDance SourPls
[3:26:21] <Monkeyweed21> @Murphio_GS Yea the whole Ocelot situation is left super vague as to whats actually going on
[3:26:25] <KeiganOfAstora> She's at +7 with the undead bone shards. Did she miss any so far?
[3:26:34] <Monkeyweed21> @thotbane Ocelot is an indigo child lol
[3:27:05] <@PatStaresAt> Its possible she missed some, once I stopped sitting in on each session shse's been skipping side rooms and such. I'll help her scrape the areas during the week for shards and upgrade mats
[3:27:27] <+realm_forge> It‚Äôs funny, when pat goes to brb it‚Äôs for a 45 min shit but Paige peppers in a dozen w min brbs
[3:27:27] <Profmcstevie> Yes pat, keep up that sigma attitude the work never ends
[3:27:28] <KeiganOfAstora> Werd, I was gonna go check the fextralife real quick but she's got enough for now
[3:27:31] <%MarylandJutsu> dang pat, you really are her coach
[3:27:31] <Murphio_GS> @Monkeyweed21 Maybe we kill Ocieros after him attempting to kill Ocelot and we unknowingly leave him to die alone NotLikeThis
[3:27:47] <+ghostfaceninja_> thanks Patty <3
[3:28:00] <rosemon5001> pat the backup crew itmejpNODDERS
[3:28:21] <+NWR_James> we'er either headed to a brick wall tonight followed by her doing it on the first try next stream or some kind of improbably BIG AND STRONG moment tonight

[3:29:12] <KeiganOfAstora> Firelink Shrine for that Estus Shard
[3:29:23] <pretendofriendo> he had a magic baby
[3:29:24] <TheEndlessRiver1> It went poorly
[3:29:28] <+GinAndRoses> what could POSSIBLY go wrong
[3:29:38] <Dunmarkh> Listen to the cut audio for this bossfight
[3:29:40] <+NWR_James> goddamn Seath
[3:29:40] <Hydrapissed> seathe did the big bang
[3:29:44] <KeiganOfAstora> Priscilla was natural
[3:29:46] <dinnydanny777> Does that mean somebody fucked a dragon
[3:29:47] <Coystick> Priscilla is naturally a best, yes.
[3:29:48] <%nip_nips> seath did the big lewd
[3:29:52] <heartlesshealer> Priscilla was born like that
[3:29:56] <KeiganOfAstora> There's animation too
[3:29:56] <Coystick> And an actual baby model
[3:29:59] <Murphio_GS> Cronch
[3:30:11] <Dunmarkh> It goes SPLORCH
[3:30:12] <+ghostfaceninja_> jesus
[3:30:14] <%TheWinged7> it still does scream
[3:30:15] <ToneBacas> FromSoft probably cut that out
[3:30:15] <Hydrapissed> CRUNCHES THE BABY
[3:30:18] <dinnydanny777> You can hear it crying
[3:30:20] <%ClericOfSparda> You kinda hear the baby crying
[3:30:20] <%nip_nips> CROMCH
[3:30:22] <TheEndlessRiver1> Paige he's insane
[3:30:24] <mr_saturday93> there used to be baby
[3:30:25] <%ItsRatman> Crushes it like a madman's essence
[3:30:26] <KeiganOfAstora> Cuz he went feral and didn't see it as his own
[3:30:27] <Hydrapissed> they cut it cause to hardcore
[3:30:29] <+HiroTSK5> You made him Angry
[3:30:29] <pretendofriendo> HES SUPER DUPER NUTSO
[3:30:32] <%BlackStarAura> FUCKED Up
[3:30:37] <KeiganOfAstora> That's really dark. Souls.
[3:30:38] <Coystick> Wow mic audio reminds me of TBFP early days
[3:30:40] <%nip_nips> what baby goes "IM A BABY!"
[3:30:41] <dinnydanny777> LUL
[3:30:42] <+G_Thunders> There‚Äôs a baby model too
[3:30:45] <moink1234> The typical baby "im a babee"
[3:30:45] <Murphio_GS> Cromch
[3:30:45] <+ALazo> babies make good paste
[3:30:49] <+HeadlessPhoenix_> wah, ima a baby, wah i dont pay taxes
[3:30:49] <+ghostfaceninja_> BabyRage I'm a baby LUL
[3:30:53] <Jaysky> I think it's cooler that it may be him imagining the baby
[3:30:54] <mr_saturday93> OH god pat dont have kids with this woman
[3:30:54] <peachy996> They cowarded out
[3:30:54] <AxelCezar> PG shit
[3:30:56] <razethetek> monkaS WubTF
[3:30:57] <JDRizzle316> it was too dark LUL
[3:30:57] <Profmcstevie> The line crosses at baby spiking
[3:30:59] <Hydrapissed> and EATING babies
[3:31:02] <TurtlesAndTentacles> Why the hell would a fucking baby say IM A BABY. HE"S NOT YOU PAT
[3:31:02] <lotharrio> Outright child murder is rough.
[3:31:04] <Hydrapissed> nah to hardcore
[3:31:05] <%3d_pbandj> You do kill a lot of babies in Bloodborne
[3:31:05] <@SoFarFetched> it was TOO straight foward
[3:31:05] <heartlesshealer> Game would be AO instead of R or whatever
[3:31:07] <ToneBacas> maybe the baby is like Priscilla and can turn invisible and we don't see it but it's there and bursts like intended
[3:31:08] <TurtlesAndTentacles> AND PAIGE
[3:31:09] <KeiganOfAstora> What exactly is Bloodborne about?
[3:31:10] <emper0rner0> There's laws in some countries against killing children in games
[3:31:10] <%TheWinged7> phrasing paige
[3:31:11] <%thotbane> BibleThump
[3:31:13] <valerios_> LUL
[3:31:13] <scrumbotime> Yes
[3:31:14] <dinnydanny777> Is this game not already rated like 18+ everywhere LUL
[3:31:17] <Profmcstevie> You can't touchdown little timmy
[3:31:18] <+allups> u dont hear the death rattle
[3:31:18] <RetroCop87> ROE VS LOTHRIC
[3:31:19] <peachy996> Think back and remember you never SEE Mergo
[3:31:20] <$Dutchpotato> It would completely fuck the games age rating Paige
[3:31:23] <HaroldDonchee> crush the baby
[3:31:24] <lotharrio> They'll lose the Australia and Germany markets if they show infants dying.
[3:31:25] <%Ell1ot> but babies are evil
[3:31:26] <+CrimKangaroo> my dog has just noticed Peach's avatar and is growling at it
[3:31:28] <KeiganOfAstora> That's Japan
[3:31:31] <%ItsRatman> Paige REALLY showing her aggression towards pregnant woman here
[3:31:33] <lexitheshark> Spike that baby into the end zone like Bones Jackson would've done
[3:31:34] <Hydrapissed> the baby isnt there really lol
[3:31:35] <pretendofriendo> the Bible explicitly tells us to smash Babies heads against STONES
[3:31:42] <sirrice77> sorry you can only imply the baby murder and not show it
[3:31:45] <TheEndlessRiver1> paige its a dragon man with magic, it doesnt have to make sense
[3:31:45] <+NWR_James> actual violence against children automatically triggers an ESRB rating
[3:31:46] <%nip_nips> spike that baby like its a touchdown
[3:31:48] <Wiiplayah43> Bloodborne isn't super-direct like that, there's a big difference
[3:31:49] <moink1234> the hot baby
[3:31:49] <+allups> u can just cant have audio
[3:31:49] <%3d_pbandj> This isn't even the first invisible Baby Paige has killed.
[3:31:50] <freelancebabymaker> YOURE PRETTY GOOD
[3:31:50] <Dunmarkh> REVOLVER
[3:31:51] <SpaceCapnCrone> REVOLVER OCELOTTE

[3:31:55] <+Solid_Stro> SNAAAAKE
[3:31:56] <lotharrio> Lottie-laddy
[3:31:57] <KeiganOfAstora> S T A M I N A @PeachSaliva
[3:32:01] <Coystick> No you have to scream it: OOOOOOCEEEEEELLLLOOOOOTTTE
[3:32:03] <Murphio_GS> Revolver Ocelotte is hot for sure
[3:32:03] <+HiroTSK5> Did you just call a baby hot?
[3:32:05] <HeroToxiko> There is totally a model for the baby but it's janky
[3:32:08] <+ghostfaceninja_> (revolver) Ocelotte
[3:32:08] <Jaysky> But his lines about him hiding don't make sense if he's actually holding him
[3:32:10] <razethetek> ohsellot
[3:32:11] <JDRizzle316> It's implied Ocelot ran away at some point
[3:32:14] <%alternative_flu> oh damn I saw it
[3:32:15] <anAngryHamster> Ocelot you need a real animal for your codename
[3:32:17] <Hydrapissed> Snake and ocelot bang aww yeh

[3:32:21] <TheEndlessRiver1> go play metal gear and think that lol
[3:32:22] <wasdsf> sploosh
[3:32:23] <ToneBacas> Revolver Ocelot
[3:32:24] <%alternative_flu> I saw him spike the baby
[3:32:25] <%nip_nips> engravings on your sword give you no tactical advantage whatsoever
[3:32:25] <moink1234> Metal gear
[3:32:25] <TurtlesAndTentacles> HWY DIDNT YOU DRINK. Paige I want to hug you into new year
[3:32:26] <rosemon5001> soo he suceeded whit seeths work? if the baby is cloaked right
[3:32:26] <HeroToxiko> Twilight?
[3:32:26] <Wiiplayah43> "you're pretty good!"
[3:32:28] <linSP> He‚Äôs hiding because he baby is invisible in his arms
[3:32:28] <+NWR_James> "That baby is kind of hot" - @PeachSaliva, 2021
[3:32:30] <%ClericOfSparda> Ahh, you saw Ocelot spike the tyke right when you died
[3:32:32] <%Ell1ot> baboo is an ocelot
[3:32:33] <peachy996> It's cool until Ovelot meow to call reinforcements
[3:32:33] <sirrice77> what if the guy then does the noise too
[3:32:36] <+zamatermort> Merooow

[3:32:45] <Hydrapissed> yah apparnetly big booba lady takes the kid away with some others
[3:32:49] <freelancebabymaker> as much as id wanna see that baby smash i like how them removing it makes whether or not the baby is even real super vague
[3:32:49] <dinnydanny777> Is priscilla half human?
[3:32:52] <Profmcstevie> That huge badonadonk and that veil give no tactical advantage whatsoever CarlSmile
[3:32:56] <Hydrapissed> they dont know what mgs is
[3:32:58] <KeiganOfAstora> She doesn't remember about the front-stab
[3:33:01] <Hydrapissed> ull be fine
[3:33:01] <+realm_forge> Ocelot is the name of a male stripper
[3:33:02] <+NWR_James> AND THEY SHOULD!
[3:33:02] <peachy996> Imagine Revolver Ocelot drinking from a bowl of milk
[3:33:06] <%nip_nips> thats just one name too
[3:33:11] <Void_The_Dark> @dinnydanny777 half god I think
[3:33:14] <%ClericOfSparda> selling those titanite shards Is some decent money
[3:33:14] <+HeadlessPhoenix_> then theres naveah
[3:33:15] <%MarylandJutsu> so is Ocerios....lothric's dad too?
[3:33:15] <%juxtest> @dinnydan777 Half "God"

[3:33:20] <%Ell1ot> you know someone named apple?
[3:33:21] <scrumbotime> I'm gonna name my child Admiral Wolverine Lightningbolt, the three best names possible
[3:33:21] <%TheWinged7> SACBRFRO is one hell of a set of initials
[3:33:22] <%3d_pbandj> Don't forget all the Kalisi's
[3:33:22] <JDRizzle316> Ocelot Johnson
[3:33:23] <BigFingerRo> I was expecting Birthday to be listed there
[3:33:26] <femto216> Wow still streaming
[3:33:26] <Hydrapissed> on right
[3:33:26] <lotharrio> My child's name is Carl. He's a stone cold psychopath.
[3:33:28] <eyeobject> Stay away from that child, Hunter
[3:33:33] <Drowsy_Tuna> I promptly told them to fuck off and stopped talking to them
[3:33:33] <%Jack_of_No_Trades> Danarys Sephiroth
[3:33:38] <dinnydanny777> @void_the_dark Oh that makes sense, does that mean a God had a baby with a dragon?
[3:33:38] <JDRizzle316> Carl Ocelot
[3:33:40] <dreamingsummer> Fern, River, And Ocelot - daym this is 100% me
[3:33:47] <TurtlesAndTentacles> good job!
[3:33:47] <KeiganOfAstora> USELESS for you!! LUL
[3:33:47] <blue8moon> chunky
[3:33:49] <Hydrapissed> she know about the shortcut on the right btw?>
[3:33:53] <KeiganOfAstora> Nope
[3:33:55] <+Solid_Stro> Unfortunately there are kids out there named Khaleesi
[3:33:59] <BigFingerRo> I wanna have a girl and name her Isabel, so I can call her Izzy
[3:34:01] <CollinsOfBodom> I do intake work for preschool. you'd be amazed some of the names that cross my desk.
[3:34:07] <KeiganOfAstora> Izzy is fun
[3:34:16] <%alternative_flu> yikes
[3:34:18] <peachy996> Wonder what Dovahkiin is up to?
[3:34:18] <Hydrapissed> some KIDS are named illdian and arthas
[3:34:20] <KeiganOfAstora> There's a whole podcast segment about it LUL
[3:34:21] <+NWR_James> yeah but it would be your fault
[3:34:25] <Void_The_Dark> @dinnydanny777 it's not very clear. Either Seath created her from an experiment or there was some strange business going on.
[3:34:25] <+TopTieramisu> khaleesi is the worst
[3:34:25] <blue8moon> I would name my daughter Isabel, it was my grandma's name :)
[3:34:28] <peachy996> Wonder if he regrets his name yet
[3:34:29] <lotharrio> One of my cousins named their first kid "Theodorus." Like holy shit...
[3:34:30] <%alternative_flu> never had a show like that bring that much emotion out of me before
[3:34:34] <Drowsy_Tuna> it's the worst
[3:34:35] <Sir_Gawain_Lotsson> Khaleesi wasn't even a FUCKING NAME
[3:34:36] <Dreigun> I have an... acquaintance who named their first kid Tyrion
[3:34:36] <VirtuaRailith> Would you name your kid something from Undertale?
[3:34:36] <%Kenzo2000> if they're young enough you could totally rename them without them knowing

[3:34:43] <scrumbotime> at that point you buy that kid a name change and just go "yeah you pick it now, i fucked up"
[3:34:47] <%3d_pbandj> at least naming your baby Jon is still fine
[3:34:47] <lexitheshark> Aria is also a style of song in opera, so you can always use that as a cover
[3:34:47] <MicrotonalMatt> Name your baby goblin
[3:34:49] <JDRizzle316> @Hydrapissed those names are kinda dope LUL
[3:34:50] <CatmanIX> did people ever name their kids Spock?
[3:34:51] <+TopTieramisu> it'll be like naming your child azor ahai

[3:35:36] <dinnydanny777> Aria seems like a nice name, it's a type of music
[3:35:37] <BigFingerRo> I'd like to have a girl and a boy, call em Izzy and Ozzy
[3:35:40] <%juxtest> This is my son. Butz
[3:35:41] <heartlesshealer> And then no more crying
[3:35:41] <%Agami23> so the baby is just invisible, right?
[3:35:47] <Monkeyweed21> He just did a rage drive on that baby
[3:35:48] <Hydrapissed> hes not there
[3:35:51] <Hydrapissed> its crazy magic

[3:36:08] <+Solid_Stro> My kids first name shall be Peach, and her middle name will be Saliva
[3:36:19] <Monkeyweed21> @Agami23 they leave it ambiguous if the baby is invisible or if he's just crazy and the baby died long ago
[3:36:20] <BigFingerRo> not TWICE PAIGE
[3:36:20] <KeiganOfAstora> Barely used any estus, sweet
[3:36:21] <%3d_pbandj> @Agami23 yup, its a real invisible baby.

[3:36:43] <maskedmook> YEAH
[3:36:45] <dinnydanny777> Kappa
[3:36:45] <peachy996> You're pretty good
[3:36:46] <GuyverTypeL> If you look at his first form he seems he id carrying the baby

[3:36:49] <Wiiplayah43> babby avenged
[3:36:50] <Primarch_Victus94> You did it
[3:36:51] <JDRizzle316> LUL
[3:36:51] <Void_The_Dark> @Agami23 that's a reasonable cannon now. Knowing that there use to be a baby model it seems more likely that the developers did a bad job cutting out the baby after they decided they didn't want it.
[3:36:51] <%juxtest> Meet my oldest son The Nerevarine
[3:36:51] <%ecolli37108> only a little bit
[3:36:54] <Murphio_GS> Choguh
[3:36:55] <peachy996> pretty.....good
[3:36:55] <%3d_pbandj> Now find that baby and make sure its dead
[3:36:56] <Hydrapissed> a dick
[3:36:56] <KeiganOfAstora> Ye ye ye
[3:36:56] <BigFingerRo> How many attempts was that?
[3:36:57] <tanarath> big chokeuh
[3:36:57] <razethetek> rah now
[3:37:00] <%nip_nips> a peanut butter DICK
[3:37:04] <Jaysky> @Agami23 He also said the baby ran away which means he was cradling nothing.
[3:37:04] <KeiganOfAstora> Just peanut butter? by itself
[3:37:05] <dinnydanny777> You know what would be a good name for a baby? Bunger.
[3:37:06] <%Ell1ot> just peanut butter?
[3:37:07] <%alternative_flu> oh man I could go for some peanut butter
[3:37:08] <%geekjacob> 7
[3:37:08] <KeiganOfAstora> 6?
[3:37:10] <%Raz_Pataz> the avatar does great covering up the sheer panic LUL
[3:37:14] <pretendofriendo> pat, can I have a spoon?
[3:37:14] <dinnydanny777> "This is my son, his name is Bunger."
[3:37:19] <Drowsy_Tuna> yeah, pats a man and can eat just peanut butter
[3:37:21] <%ClericOfSparda> How is Zangief not going nuts about peanut butter?
[3:37:26] <Hydrapissed> yah we need a panic emote for the model
[3:37:26] <Gelphaze> Timed to cash in!
[3:37:27] <MoonlightWolves> micOwO
[3:37:30] <BigFingerRo> @dinnydanny777 do you have another son called unger
[3:37:31] <%ssjklyco> 5 DS bosses in 3 days
[3:37:31] <KeiganOfAstora> These games are so easy when you use a big weapon
[3:37:35] <+lil_scooby_snack> big
[3:37:36] <Jaysky> Also if the baby were there and survived the squish during the fight why isn't it still crying after the King dies?
[3:37:38] <rosemon5001> smash that gilf dragons booty
[3:37:40] <Monkeyweed21> @PeachSaliva you can get dancer's swords and dance with them
[3:37:41] <dinnydanny777> @bigfingerro No but that's a good idea LUL
[3:37:53] <%MarylandJutsu> it didn't survive Jay
[3:37:53] <peachy996> King squished that baby
[3:37:55] <%AncelDeLambert> @PeachSaliva you still have Seigmayer's stuff to pick up, I think
[3:37:57] <%ClericOfSparda> Near the end of the game is kind of a boss rush
[3:37:57] <Hydrapissed> got estus shard
[3:37:59] <peachy996> He crushed it good
[3:38:04] <freelancebabymaker> has she noticed eygon standing there yet lol
[3:38:05] <+SciFiBrony> @Hydrapissed Except she'd be too busy panicking too much to change to it üòÜ
[3:38:05] <Jaysky> @MarylandJutsu It totally cried throughout the fight
[3:38:08] <KeiganOfAstora> Use the boss souls. You don't need them @PatStaresAt @PeachSaliva
[3:38:12] <peachy996> Everyone has their theory and I prefer mine
[3:38:13] <Monkeyweed21> @freelancebabymaker she talked to him
[3:38:14] <Hydrapissed> the kid was taking away before this fight
[3:38:26] <freelancebabymaker> @Monkeyweed21 oh ok mustve missed it
[3:38:27] <%nip_nips> 4
[3:38:38] <TheEndlessRiver1> did she ever get karla?
[3:38:40] <Wiiplayah43> @void_the_dark not bad, just minimal, since it's an easy assumption that Oceiros is hallucinating.
[3:38:42] <KeiganOfAstora> You can upgrade
[3:38:48] <Monkeyweed21> @KeiganOfAstora the dancer swords are worth checking out
[3:38:49] <Hydrapissed> is pat just eating peanut butter>

[3:58:47] <%Rumbutt> he woke up too late
[3:58:48] <KeiganOfAstora> Did someone fuck up his timing on purpose? Mayne Pontiff Sulyvahn?
[3:58:48] <dinnydanny777> why didn't he just be build differend
[3:58:51] <$rdark_ksu> Like when you for some reason wake up at 4 am and can't get back to sleep
[3:58:53] <+Fidranth> set his alarm for am instead of pm
[3:58:55] <Monkeyweed21> Gundyr woke up too late @PatStaresAt
[3:58:57] <%ElkRiverDog> *never been happier to not be wearing headphones*
[3:59:01] <Ravioli_Ronin> Patches didn‚Äôt set his alarm for him

[3:59:15] <%ClericOfSparda> why heal directly in front of him?
[3:59:17] <%nip_nips> you thought you were hot shit until you met THE CHAMP
[3:59:19] <freelancebabymaker> @KeiganOfAstora probably maybe yeah. theres a theory that links him to the lothric royal family
[3:59:22] <%juxtest> Good job Peach. Ruin his self esteem by making him think you let him win
[3:59:25] <Monkeyweed21> The only thing keeping the rest of the world from looking like THIS is Ludleth
[3:59:27] <dinnydanny777> Do Mace's still do big damage to armored guys like 2 LUL
[3:59:29] <CollinsOfBodom> I got lucky with this guy my first fight ever and a glitch occurred
[3:59:37] <+hyren21> Born too late to link the fire, born just in time to kick players in the face
