[0:01:55] <+informedotaku> Helltakers I hope
[0:01:56] <%mield916> HELLTAKER
[0:01:59] <@SoFarFetched> Probably no Ace Attorney since I'm sure she wants to be her best during that.

[0:02:02] <PlaidisTheNewPlaid> Aww yeah, time to go to sleep because I have work in the morning

[0:02:09] <%spiritofmojave> Puzzles?!
[0:02:14] <%spiritofmojave> OH BOY!
[0:02:20] <TheFramedWarlock> Shadow puzzles hopefully
[0:02:25] <cureneckbeard> shadow puzzles
[0:02:26] <DracaenaLeaf> wait are we live again? stream said it ended a minute ago but it shows that it's live now
[0:02:27] <+StrangeCoincidence> why does it cost $10 just to use doorstop?
[0:02:28] <IronGlorfindel> Does paige know Helltaker has Skeletons?
[0:02:28] <+Bluwizard21> PAT IS SLEEP POST JUST THE HAM MEMES
[0:02:29] <%TheWinged7> Dangit Peach, streaming 1 day before my re-sub now I'll have to wait a whole month before being able to say anything :P
[0:02:29] <%GabeSweetMan> Getting started nice and Sundowned.
[0:02:32] <coffeeabomination> Baba is stream?
[0:02:34] <Solidus_113> Helltaker will take no more than an hour and a half. It's an easy stream
[0:02:37] <Nordguy> i KNEW i did the right thing not to sleep!
[0:02:39] <Spydurman> Dead by Daylight would be a comfort pick, Phoenix Wright would be fun and whacky and FNAF would be hilarious and stressful for her. All good choices
[0:02:39] <%Promessa_EX> if paige is 15 minutes late, we are legally allowed to leave
[0:02:41] <Graxe_> Today's stream is a mystery
[0:02:41] <%optimasmaximas> i think it might just be an stream for once
[0:02:46] <zax130> pcrowHype pcrowHype pcrowHype pcrowHype pcrowHype pcrowHype pcrowHype pcrowHype pcrowHype pcrowHype pcrowHype pcrowHype pcrowHype pcrowHype pcrowHype pcrowHype pcrowHype pcrowHype pcrowHype pcrowHype
[0:02:46] <Graxe_> There might not even be a game
[0:02:47] <%optimasmaximas> or just chatting
[0:02:48] <%korth367> @Solidus_113 this is paige tho
[0:02:52] <+Fooguwu> What should we all convince her to play
[0:02:55] <ShineTheDiamond> Dead by Daylight is always fun to watch
[0:02:56] <%optimasmaximas> she said she might not be up for a game
[0:02:59] <@SoFarFetched> I feel like dead by daylight wouldn't be good for her back if she gets jump scares.
[0:03:00] <Solidus_113> you can freely skip puzzles and miss nothign
[0:03:02] <$Sphincter_Spelunker> Play Zoombinis
[0:03:03] <redtailedchonk> I am ready to vibe
[0:03:06] <$shadylawyerman> hey gang
[0:03:08] <Nordguy> play MINECRAFT
[0:03:14] <JonesMcFly> DoritosChip DoritosChip Kappa
[0:03:15] <Solidus_113> the only thing that will be a "challenge" is the final battle
[0:03:18] <@SoFarFetched> Especially if her body jumps during the scares
[0:03:19] <+StrangeCoincidence> io sono preggenerooooo
[0:03:25] <brambobelurkin> The time has coom
[0:03:26] <%TheZearGuy> While we wait, anyone try the free FF14? I’m so confused by everything.
[0:03:30] <Spydurman> she usually doesn't get jump scared by Dead by Daylight, just yelling about balls in her ass
[0:03:40] <+StrangeCoincidence> balls? in her ASS?
[0:03:43] <NeroInfinite> Ah good ol I dunno streams
[0:03:48] <@SoFarFetched> Hey never underestimate paige on what she gets scared by
[0:03:48] <%BourneWarrior> Oh Yeah its Sundowning Time
[0:03:49] <TheArrow_> it's more likely than you think
[0:03:53] <weissguard> True. But a small spasm could make a problem worse.
[0:03:57] <@SoFarFetched> she could suddenly get scared at a door opening
[0:03:57] <%korth367> Just chattin
[0:04:00] <%GabeSweetMan> Reminder that today is the 2 year anniversary of TotaliBiscuit's death: Aka this guy -> LUL

The cats turn into goo cats during this time & just lay all over the floor just to feel cooler. I aim the Dyson fan at them & occasionally spray a mist of water on them to cool them down. They don't mind the water during this time,they just look so defeated when it gets hot.

[1:49:18] <Zaphire_Saucypants> @GarbageQueenEllie wait...I forgot, they have to reposition between shots. If we're talking real life.
[1:49:20] <Neo_Kaiser> That guy who killed her said, "You win this? I win this"
[1:49:22] <MayorRev> My favorite paige moments are when she panics and then acts all cool when she solves the problem by accident
[1:49:24] <$Sphincter_Spelunker> yeah, look up how to make McD's fries at home.
[1:49:27] <DandyMackeroos> McDonalds fries are dry and tasteless if not fresh
[1:49:37] <kikispagh3tti> You can ask for them to be made fresh.
[1:49:39] <GarbageQueenEllie> @Zaphire_Saucypants Yeah, but I count it as camping if they just sit there for days
[1:49:41] <noahjpvd> ah
[1:49:42] <%maenos2> @mckraven hmm, good point. I would like to buy your bushes.
[1:49:43] <kikispagh3tti> Here's a hack; ask for them without salt.

[1:50:18] <Zaphire_Saucypants> @GarbageQueenEllie fair point. Just a sniper and his spotter camping out, dudes bein bros.
[1:50:18] <%StaceMcGate> no
[1:50:19] <$thomassolorio> no it loud

[1:50:30] <Valdorick> psa1guy
[1:50:30] <%worldbrand> No like you haven't been saying much
[1:50:31] <%Keyd00d> I think they meant it's just quiet and comfy
[1:50:33] <Kiari13> it's a little quiet but it's ALWAYS this quiet on your streams
[1:50:36] <kikispagh3tti> She's concentrating.
[1:50:38] <+TheHeroAppears> as in you are focusing meaning you are not talking as much
[1:50:38] <DandyMackeroos> It’s quiet as in not too talky
[1:50:39] <GarbageQueenEllie> @Zaphire_Saucypants 500 feet apart cuz THEY'RE NOT GAY
[1:50:40] <Kiari13> so people are used to it
[1:50:41] <NephiStreams> do not turn up the volume, have mercy @PeachSaliva LUL
[1:50:42] <Sir_Dolphinian> "quiet" as in the streamer isnt constantly screaming i guess
[1:50:42] <DedlokPM> Think they meant "Quiet Stream" as in a "Chill Stream"
[1:50:43] <%oda_flobunaga> @Admiral_PopnFresh Being dominated by Subs no less
[1:50:46] <kikispagh3tti> She's doing pretty good, so the focus is MAD.
[1:50:52] <$mckraven> 100% focus no room for talking
[1:50:54] <yourliteraldog> HALO Ops

[2:03:16] <zeif00> Who do you think the new killer is going to be Paige?
[2:03:18] <%Keyd00d> 2 hours of donosn at the end
[2:03:31] <+soullesskin> Awwww but I feel his goblin presence
[2:03:35] <boomstickery> Pat?
[2:03:35] <Ziegsy> Its gonna be jaws.
[2:03:36] <Azathotic> They won't do that
[2:03:37] <$Sphincter_Spelunker> chucky in da hood
[2:03:40] <laguerrilha> Can you unlock new killers by playing or you need to pay?
[2:03:41] <Valdorick> Face Hugger
[2:03:41] <%GabeSweetMan> PAT?
[2:03:44] <+LordSDB> Chuckie would be broken
[2:03:45] <%ThePuddingDead> we've literally had this conversation
[2:03:46] <Ziegsy> land shark
[2:03:46] <colouroftheiris77> Ohhh I made it just in time!
[2:03:46] <+lupinelass120> You just want to play as Pat
[2:03:46] <Pookiedaexzile> Leprechaun from the hood only
[2:03:49] <+soullesskin> Goethe curry
[2:03:50] <+Taengoo31> yoshikage kira Kappa
[2:03:51] <+Walopoh> Candyman dude
[2:03:52] <$thomassolorio> come on preditor
[2:03:52] <+The_Butterfly_Man> @Ziegsy Jaws would be hype
[2:03:54] <+demon1103> would love Leprachaun!!
[2:03:55] <Azathotic> Pretty sure they said they would never do Killer in different size/shape
[2:03:57] <+corgispudmen> Trolls
[2:03:58] <Shadope342> does that mean we can also do candyman
[2:03:59] <DandyMackeroos> Chucky has voodoo
[2:04:01] <$thomassolorio> joker
[2:04:01] <TomFrank> chucky would work so well
[2:04:04] <Azathotic> I want Candyman or Pinhead
[2:04:05] <Manmadeawesome> chucky gave me nightmares as a kid, that doll can burn in hell
[2:04:05] <%Bt_Robot> When's Critters?
[2:04:06] <Pookiedaexzile> The Gremlins
[2:04:06] <multi_streams> maybe giant doll chucky
[2:04:06] <Ziegsy> @Pookiedaexzile A friend with weed is a friend indeed!
[2:04:07] <boomstickery> the blob would be interesting
[2:04:09] <$BuoyantSoul> that one guy from Phantasm that has the flying death sphere
[2:04:12] <harlekuin966> cjuck
[2:04:13] <+Walopoh> Beetlejuice is my fantasy LUL
[2:04:20] <$Sphincter_Spelunker> is pumpkin head in this
[2:04:22] <JetpackMcQuack> Chucky would be hard to make I feel
[2:04:27] <Pookiedaexzile> THE puppets from Puppet Master
[2:04:28] <+LordSDB> Chuckie is too small and too fast Make it so he has to at least hit 4 times
[2:04:29] <TomFrank> correction, chucky would work well besides the picking people up part
[2:04:32] <laguerrilha> The crocked-man would be interesting
[2:04:37] <zeif00> People been big pushing Candyman cause the new movie is coming out
[2:04:41] <skyentombment> Ah yes, time for chicken dinners
[2:04:41] <DandyMackeroos> @buoyantsoul You mean Tall Man from Phantasm
[2:04:43] <Ziegsy> Alien would be awesome, but im betting on either dracula or terminator
[2:04:44] <%dekkitout> Candyman is my personal pick
[2:04:46] <%EynosStyles> would like to see a krampus
[2:04:52] <%Bt_Robot> Rapping Leprechaun would be the scariest monster...
[2:04:53] <DandyMackeroos> Candyman is pretty good
[2:04:55] <laguerrilha> krampus is a good one too
[2:04:57] <%maenos2> DEJA VU
[2:05:00] <%Reaped_Psyche> Oh man. Seeing Paige play Spelunky would be amazing. I don't know why I thought of that just now, but yes. Yes please.
[2:05:01] <Pookiedaexzile> Candyman but only if they could get the orginal actor
[2:05:08] <DandyMackeroos> Shootin the bees at people is pretty good
[2:05:09] <Pookiedaexzile> dudes too iconic to pass up
[2:05:09] <@Calek> they should add the Jeepers Creepers man
[2:05:11] <Psych_man13_13> Check out the new survivor
[2:05:17] <%ElkRiverDog> Is a slender man knock off in it yet?
[2:05:20] <$Sphincter_Spelunker> swish
[2:05:23] <+LordSDB> Jeeper Creepers would be godlike
[2:05:25] <%SvenHolgersson> WHERES STEVE
[2:05:26] <%EynosStyles> keeper creepers
[2:05:27] <skyentombment> Hey, guys, where's Orbman at?

[2:05:30] <%maenos2> seriously no one else gonna continue deja vu? y'all suck
[2:05:32] <+Jaysky> When is Aerith with chair?
[2:05:34] <Ziegsy> @ElkRiverDog legion is some creepy pasta bullshit
[2:05:41] <+The_Butterfly_Man> tomorrow is the 4th anniversary stream right?
[2:05:45] <%CrypticMochi> I wonder if they’re able to do a killer that stays still but teleports around?
[2:05:46] <%Bt_Robot> Peach's shirt tells monsters get dunked on!
[2:05:49] <DandyMackeroos> Jeeper the Creeper would fly and stuff
[2:05:54] <Ziegsy> @Jaysky you mean chairith?
[2:05:55] <Azathotic> @Calek The creator of Jeepers Creepers is a convicted pedophile
[2:06:01] <Pookiedaexzile> The chick from Autospy
[2:06:01] <zeif00> They're gonna announce a bunch of shit
[2:06:01] <Gutsandlove> tes
[2:06:05] <$TheKillerStove> @LordSDB They're not gonna touch the creeper witha 10 foot pole. The writer/director is a convicted pedo. lots of baggage there
[2:06:05] <Gutsandlove> yes
[2:06:07] <%EynosStyles> the guy from Sinister
[2:06:08] <%ElenaManetta> yeah the 4th stream you've ever done
[2:06:09] <+The_Butterfly_Man> for dead by daylight
[2:06:10] <SaltyDongs> woo
[2:06:11] <+Jaysky> Yes, Chairith would be a good addtion to DBD
[2:06:17] <%ElenaManetta> one stream a year
[2:06:21] <$Sphincter_Spelunker> the 4th stream this year
[2:06:23] <%Bt_Robot> YOU'VE STREAMED AT LEAST FIVE TIMES, THAT PERSON WAS CLEARLY LYING
[2:06:23] <+corgispudmen> crtl
[2:06:26] <+Zereaux> HELLRAISER
[2:06:27] <+Jaysky> Although they'd have to nerf her 1 hit ko
[2:06:28] <Ziegsy> the survivor would be sephiroth, just run from the chair
[2:06:40] <Pookiedaexzile> Raw Head Rex
[2:06:44] <Pookiedaexzile> but the dick version
[2:06:44] <zeif00> fuck nurse
[2:06:45] <%EynosStyles> or the devil from insidious
[2:06:46] <TomFrank> rawhead rex would be a great addition
[2:06:46] <Psych_man13_13> Also they changed how items work since you last played
[2:06:46] <+LordSDB> Oh man that super sucks @TheKillerStove
[2:06:52] <%oda_flobunaga> that would probably cause sepsis
[2:06:53] <+MillerLowlife> raincoat killer from deadly p
[2:06:55] <TomFrank> @Pookiedaexzile yes
[2:07:03] <%depressed_skeleton> So this is what happened to peaches ass
[2:07:04] <$Sphincter_Spelunker> oink oink
[2:07:08] <%dekkitout> Almost any cenobite would be cool
[2:07:09] <%nman9> 5 min
[2:07:11] <DandyMackeroos> Rawhead Rex would be really good at breaking things
[2:07:12] <Azathotic> Pallet dropping a Nurse LUL
[2:07:14] <+logoth_> Serpentinne
[2:07:14] <+Zereaux> gremlins
[2:07:19] <Valdorick> THE JUKES
[2:07:20] <%ThePuddingDead> wa
[2:07:20] <%RadicalWeegee> wha
[2:07:20] <+Zereaux> HAHAHAHA
[2:07:20] <boomstickery> how?!
[2:07:21] <Ziegsy> Its robocop and his nemesis, bad robocop
[2:07:27] <%ThePuddingDead> how the
[2:07:27] <$TheKillerStove> Is there a Samara knock off in yet? I'd love the long haired ghost girl archetype to get some rep
[2:07:28] <+Jaysky> Weird how Nurse hasn't done the nursey thing yet
[2:07:34] <Valdorick> The killer is your woman! Your Stand is working!
[2:07:45] <zeif00> Bought some good time
[2:07:46] <+logoth_> You got her to chase for for awhile though
[2:07:46] <colouroftheiris77> U need a bandade?
[2:07:49] <%ThePuddingDead> that took a bit
[2:07:51] <Azathotic> @Ziegsy Bad Robocop is literally just ED209 or Robocop II
[2:07:52] <+kewlmyc> You ran right back towards her
[2:07:53] <Pookiedaexzile> Wait...what if they went cool and put in Nemsis
[2:07:58] <%maenos2> god the hook always looks so painful
[2:08:02] <%holydeviant1> Would you say dead by daylight is the Smash Brothers of slasher flicks?
[2:08:07] <Zaku_III> Man, Paige is really HOOKED on this game.
[2:08:08] <Ziegsy> @Azathotic exactly. bad robocop.
[2:08:10] <Setaro> That was some good dodging
[2:08:15] <DandyMackeroos> Thanks for being next to the hook
[2:08:19] <%dekkitout> @Pookiedaexzile I think that's just REsistance
[2:08:22] <+chocolat3_milk> that was a good chase
[2:08:25] <Azathotic> @Ziegsy He's not called... nevermind
[2:08:25] <+chocolat3_milk> they got 2 gens done
[2:08:25] <%ThePuddingDead> @holydeviant1 that would be more like Freddy vs Jason
[2:08:26] <boomstickery> totem?
[2:08:30] <T_Sasquatch> @holydeviant1 no thats mortal kombat
[2:08:31] <DandyMackeroos> You’re doing good work Paige
[2:08:35] <FelixQuinnNoir> for real that was a great chase some crazy dodge
[2:08:39] <Ziegsy> @Azathotic :D
[2:08:40] <stranger59> Just sleep it off in the locker
[2:08:43] <+Jaysky> To be fair, being on a hook would do more than just hurt a bit
[2:08:53] <%EynosStyles> I think a giant eye ball with tentacles
[2:08:59] <Ziegsy> Pinhead would be aesthetically pleasing
[2:09:02] <+Jaysky> You'd be bleeding like a pig for the rest of the game
[2:09:03] <Buttsoup_Barnes> oh boy another game
[2:09:03] <$Sphincter_Spelunker> you're also being hooked right above the heart, how not dead
[2:09:05] <Pookiedaexzile> Vampire from 30 days of night

[2:16:20] <T_Sasquatch> LUL
[2:16:22] <%ShichiNoBushi> "Fired for demanding her paycheck"?
[2:16:24] <+Jaysky> It's a character backstory @masterp_91
[2:16:28] <%SvenHolgersson> This is some Tumblr shit
[2:16:28] <Ratfacepunk> characters in slasher films don't have this much backstory
[2:16:30] <Valdorick> Eat the rich?
[2:16:31] <JetpackMcQuack> How old is this person
[2:16:33] <lvl10cybermancer> Enjoy all of this backstory that will never be relevant to anything in game
[2:16:37] <%ThePuddingDead> in her 40's
[2:16:37] <pizzapastamn> This is really extra
[2:16:38] <%Keyd00d> what

[2:25:12] <%ShockzNDrawe> hangin
[2:25:15] <+skylerpilot> @StaceMcGate well... normally you would do it when the killer is MUCH closer to you as a way to dodge their attacks and confuse them, as they have a first person camera and can't follow movements that circle them nearly as well... but Paige didn't use to circle lol
[2:25:17] <$HarraceHarrison> Ah, the basement of safety
