[0:01:50] <+FrostMass22> Prepare for the story to shit itself in the last act
[0:01:51] <waterstealer> they just smashed last night
[0:01:53] <GarbageQueenEllie> I was JUST watching the VOD for the last session
[0:01:54] <DonatelloJose> I wonder if the basketball will be mad.
[0:01:57] <waterstealer> then they played super smash bros
[0:01:59] <waterstealer> HEYP
[0:02:04] <waterstealer> HEYO
[0:02:04] <flame_of_udun_> The story shits itself way earlier than that
[0:02:05] <thelaxinator> surprised she hasn't set up a spoiler room for the chat
[0:02:13] <+FrostMass22> Patsketball
[0:02:17] <sectorclaus> Do YoU lIkE jUmPeR?

[0:02:30] <waterstealer> just smash
[0:02:34] <alrobot2014> the story shits itself earlier, but this is when it starts rubbing the shit on itself
[0:02:35] <waterstealer> good clip came out of it
[0:02:36] <zamzoph> I'm just here for the Ruby Weapon Hour before the video game
[0:02:37] <%ssjklyco> I predict she gets Kara killed
[0:02:39] <$Sphincter_Spelunker> Those podcast clips were brutal, can't wait to catch the audio version
[0:02:39] <%happyface699> Sweet I don’t need the vod

[0:02:58] <+manwithboxonhead> I know I thought we were going to see Detroit: Become Gun.
[0:03:00] <waterstealer> i predict she gets connor killed, since she kills all the ones she loves
[0:03:12] <$Sphincter_Spelunker> Connor is not girl tho
[0:03:15] <blackbaron98> well hi there
[0:03:18] <%king_wragles> We raffle in Pat's stream... what do we do to panic in Paige's stream?
[0:03:18] <waterstealer> neither was papyrus

[0:03:23] <+PipIV> well hello
[0:03:25] <vexicbayn> Detroit Gun Humans begins now
[0:03:27] <+badchoice5> Is she late? Or is every clock wrong? Think about it.
[0:03:32] <GarbageQueenEllie> I wonder how Paige will react once she finds out that Kara is a ROBOT
[0:03:34] <$SleepyMaribo> !panic
[0:03:35] <waterstealer> KILL THE CHILD
[0:03:37] <%MaximumDaximum> What if Connor gets into Smash?
[0:03:40] <benjiFG> hank's son's name is GUN

[0:06:03] <+MildMannered> I actually caught a stream!
[0:06:04] <waterstealer> DELTARUUUNE
[0:06:06] <waterstealer> GUYS
[0:06:10] <waterstealer> SUSIE'S IN SMASH
[0:06:14] <waterstealer> QUOTE ME
[0:06:17] <+PipIV> wat
[0:06:23] <%happyface699> What is this
[0:06:25] <waterstealer> IT'S NOT FRISK OR SANS
[0:06:26] <flame_of_udun_> @waterstealer preserved for posterity
[0:06:26] <Breaburn_op> Some legends say toby fox whistled a toon while taking a piss in a local restroom. There were 7 remixes not even 30 minutes later...
[0:06:28] <waterstealer> ITS GONNA BE SUSIE
[0:06:29] <Arclight2879> Who's ready for android genocide?
[0:06:29] <DXLelouch24> itll be Sans, if only so Paige can rub it in Pats face
[0:06:37] <vexicbayn> if anybody underale makes it it'll be Undyne
[0:06:38] <+pleasenameyourcharacter> Speaking of Undertale music, I got into an argument with a friend the other day where he said "pianos are always sad." I plan on blasting Death By Glamor" into my mic next time to prove him fucking wrong.
[0:06:40] <GarbageQueenEllie> TFW Alphys gets into Smash for the lolz
[0:06:41] <DXLelouch24> and since he said it wont be Sans
[0:06:43] <%CaptainPileDriver> this game robs you of the ending with kara by lying to you
[0:06:44] <DXLelouch24> itl;l be Sand
[0:06:49] <DXLelouch24> Sans*
[0:06:54] <blackbaron98> what if its chara
[0:06:55] <waterstealer> @Breaburn_op that's strong
[0:06:58] <vexicbayn> Sand Undersale
[0:07:02] <$GohanEgret> Sand Uddertell
[0:07:09] <%Toynota10> So I've missed her entire 2nd run so far. What has she done?
[0:07:12] <%king_wragles> @pleasenameyourcharacter ... doesn't *** sky have a piano in it? Isn't it mostly MOSTLY piano?
[0:07:14] <+PipIV> the indigo child
[0:07:15] <+Reizunari> I just sat down to watch the ultimate VOD
[0:07:22] <flame_of_udun_> All memes aside, do you guys honestly think Sans is one of the DLC’s?
[0:07:27] <DXLelouch24> yes
[0:07:28] <alrobot2014> @Toynota10 this is her first run
[0:07:29] <%Kataguro> Didn't we just start the revolution proper last time?
[0:07:34] <%happyface699> @captainpiledriver She will be sad when she finds out hank is a indigo child and Kara is the oragami killa
[0:07:35] <%legendfather_of_giants> possible but not likely
[0:07:35] <+badchoice5> This sounds like Sonic music
[0:07:35] <DXLelouch24> alongside Dante and Subzero
[0:07:37] <%Toynota10> Ohhhhhhh yeah that makes more sense
[0:07:39] <DXLelouch24> lol
[0:07:40] <+PipIV> naw
[0:07:40] <$GohanEgret> @flame_of_udun_ I think there's a good shot
[0:07:43] <VictorySauce23> Hello, gamers
[0:07:45] <+FrostMass22> if any indie character would be in it, it would be an Undertale character
[0:07:48] <GarbageQueenEllie> Has Paige gotten to fuck North yet?
[0:07:51] <OwlLightningMage> I think an Undertale character has a good chance
[0:07:54] <DXLelouch24> ahh i love Max but hes crazy
[0:07:55] <+pleasenameyourcharacter> @king_wragles I'm not familiar, so i couldn't say.
[0:07:56] <%shozent> He is supreme the most incredible machine
[0:07:58] <flame_of_udun_> @gohanegret I guess crazier things have happened
[0:07:59] <+FrostMass22> And I mean not as an assist trophy
[0:07:59] <waterstealer> it has a better chance of being frisk than sans
[0:08:02] <+PipIV> North remains unfucked
[0:08:04] <+MarshallLee67> YEET
[0:08:04] <%Toynota10> Have Paige murdered all the women?
[0:08:05] <waterstealer> YEYEYEYEYE

Especially the part where Pat was ON FIRE mainly because Paige burned him as he was the basketball. Or should I say the Patketball? Nailed it! Paige, any xmas shopping yet? Pat, will you be going back to Monster Hunter for the Blood, I mean Iceborne expansion? Can’t wait for tonight’s play of Detroit: Become Smash Gameplay.
[0:09:45] <PanicSwytch> When you finish Detroit, Pat should dust off his Xbox and stream the DMC 5 demo!

[0:11:59] <$Sphincter_Spelunker> cheer222 Hello today. Missed the last few of y'alls streams so I don't know if it came up again, but I heard talks of potential doggos. Now, there are very few wrong answers when it comes to dogs, until you listed some. French Bulldogs. Ugly. English Bulldogs. Struggle to even breathe. Great Danes. What's so great about them? Nothing. A brown Newfoundland named Snuffleupagus? No contest. Clearly, the only option. And if it's a girl, you can call her Alice aka Mr. Snuffleupagus' little sister.
[0:12:01] <+sogeki_dan> You are the fries in the happy meal
[0:12:03] <Rockgagong> you are wonderful, mustardy pepper

[0:16:42] <+smargh1015> don't hit your SOs guys
[0:16:43] <+PipIV> what's a sidescrollers?
[0:16:44] <%legendfather_of_giants> @PeachSaliva she was only arrested for throwing some cardboard at him
[0:16:44] <%lethallunacyx> where?
[0:16:45] <+skizzuto> but Pat the basketball was definitely the highlight of the podcast
[0:16:45] <%linSP> Ninja???
[0:16:45] <+Yumonikki> Hallo people! KonCha
[0:16:45] <Luesagna00> @peachsaliva brothers and sisters shouldnt be fighting! NomNom
[0:16:48] <tarkus_awesome> @peachsaliva what fornite guy???
[0:16:48] <zamzoph> what does "cleared" mean?
[0:16:49] <%umbypokochan> it can't be as bad as when that soccer ref got his arms and legs ripped off
[0:16:50] <waterstealer> VICTORY ROYALE DOMESTIC ABUSE
[0:16:52] <+shawntk_> HE RAN FROM THE COPS
[0:16:52] <%cirilionaire> Don't hit people
[0:16:54] <%Logan_Jennings1> I watched like 15 seconds of it, it was... not good.
[0:16:55] <%Djinnazz> @PeachSaliva Paige looks like she's about to be chasd and murdered by Michael Myers.
[0:16:55] <+Reizunari> They were both wrong but he took it to far
[0:16:55] <BimboBagging> At least it was caught on camera
[0:16:56] <mechasloth23> don't watch it
[0:17:01] <%JackMillerTime> are abusers targeted in prison inmates or is it just pedos?
[0:17:02] <%SuperCasualBoom> @zamzoph Stage Cleared...?
[0:17:03] <DonatelloJose> Wait he ran? Wow
[0:17:09] <+FrostMass22> @zamzoph I think both were charged with domestic abuse
[0:17:09] <Arclight2879> I blame both those chucklefucks.
[0:17:10] <$GohanEgret> @tarkus_awesome apparently some fortnite streamer beat his wife on stream
[0:17:11] <DatAsuna> well, caught on mic
[0:17:12] <+Pavi132> That clip made me feel physically ill to be completely honest...
[0:17:15] <DatAsuna> not camera
[0:17:22] <+badchoice5> This, from the Domestic Abuse Power Hour?
[0:17:22] <zamzoph> @FrostMass22 oh okay
[0:17:24] <Worldbrand> What, don't stop?
[0:17:24] <Estuko> That abuse clip made me sick to my stomach, not fond of revisiting memories
[0:17:25] <+Pavi132> The screams were pretty horrifying
[0:17:31] <Bouldus> @JackMillerTime i mean hes in Australia, so yes
[0:17:31] <TheZillex> Abuse your family for VBucks
[0:17:32] <%duneblythe> Ironically, a twitch streamer hit an actually pregnant lady
[0:17:32] <%CaptainPileDriver> THERE'S A DIFFERENCE BETWEEN PAPERTOWLES AND A FIST
[0:17:34] <alrobot2014> You may want to rephase that
[0:17:35] <GarbageQueenEllie> @JackMillerTime I've heard it's always pedos and mommy killers that get rekt in prison
[0:17:37] <%SuperCasualBoom> What about Street Fighter?
[0:17:40] <Bouldus> @JackMillerTime idk about anywhere else
[0:17:41] <%abadbadman> i'll throw Oranges in socks at people, it doesnt bruise so that makes it OKAY!
[0:17:42] <DatAsuna> If you have to tell someone that, they won't listen
[0:17:43] <Recthel> you tell that to children
[0:17:46] <+shawntk_> pat should go off screen and yell and whine and say paige is beating him
[0:17:47] <katocrimson> wuf
[0:17:50] <%legendfather_of_giants> @PeachSaliva you said dont stop
[0:17:51] <+pleasenameyourcharacter> I wasn't thinking once and threw scissors. Nobody got hirt, but I learned my lesson.
[0:17:52] <$renegadehatter> cheer100 cheer100 Hi Paige and Pat I guess, been awhile since I've donated, but I'm glad to finally see you finish one of my favorite 2018 games and yes I know it's a David Cage game.

[0:17:53] <$rdark_ksu> keep yo hands to yoself
[0:17:54] <Arclight2879> It's not abuse of you yell yeet as you do it
[0:17:54] <Worldbrand> You said if somebody tells you to stop hitting them, don't
[0:17:55] <+NightOwlSam> just throw papertowels at pat so he'll have something for when he drops the tp in the toilet again
[0:17:57] <alrobot2014> You said to don't not stop
[0:17:58] <suikudo> that poor kid
[0:17:58] <$MagickBurritoh> @PeachSaliva is there a correlation between fortnite and beating your wife?
[0:18:00] <+MarshallLee67> LUL

[1:04:23] <DonatelloJose> At some point, the unconscious should take over that fear.
[1:04:23] <doofmaster> She's talking about Dick Masterson
[1:04:24] <%TheMilhouseExperience> This game is about killing robot slaves.

[1:04:33] <$Totally_not_toby> my friend had her first period in white pants while giving a presentation at school
[1:04:34] <GarbageQueenEllie> I'd be more scared of the poo than the blood- at least the blood's SUPPOSED to do that
[1:04:35] <+JakeIsNotGross> The fear stems from there being a problem we DON'T KNOW ABOUT.
[1:04:35] <%happyface699> Sharding
[1:04:35] <%emoonimoo> But what if a lady has IBS?
[1:04:36] <+cereal_box_conspiracy> Eat more == more poop?

[1:04:42] <%ssjklyco> We fart alot, so there is the fear that a fart will be more.
[1:04:43] <+pleasenameyourcharacter> because ladies are such a pain in our asses.

[1:04:57] <+UncannyMatt> We fear unexpected nuts
[1:04:59] <Endocrom> The android's reaction is appropriate
[1:04:59] <+FrostMass22> If men had a period, they would let it stain their pants to assert dominance

[2:07:28] <+NightOwlSam> he meets you down in the evidence room and tries to kill you
[2:07:32] <hntronium> @MildMannered She has a walkthrough

[2:47:18] <+barretzm> Todd is bad but not nearly as evil as the game thinks he is
[2:47:19] <T_Sasquatch> Its like beating your toy

[2:47:20] <Dr_mr_wang> todd took out the LED, so he did illegal things, oh yeah and the drugs
[2:47:22] <+walternatorz> How did Alice name Kara.

[2:47:35] <reonome> todd had an actual kid
[2:47:35] <OwlLightningMage> TODD BOUGH STRESS BALLS
[2:47:35] <%Kataguro> Todd bought a Tamagachi and a Dakimakura, and the latter shot him
[2:47:35] <deviljhojho94> PAIGE WHY
[2:47:37] <sackerkappa> So Kara is a sexbot all along...
[2:47:39] <averagehero1> TODD IS THE REAL HERO OF THIS STORY
[2:47:40] <DesperaDo2077> THE GAME FALLS APART
[2:47:42] <AlasterAngelo> THAT'S RIGHT PAT
[2:47:43] <TheZombiepope> CRAZY TALK
[2:47:43] <%AncelDeLambert> Pat you're doing the big spoils
[2:47:45] <circular7> paige got her mind blown
[2:47:46] <%Skeletorexplains> the child looks nothing like the childbot
[2:47:47] <mechasloth23> It all means nothing, this is such a bad twist
[2:47:47] <Gruhunchously> Guy who lives in destitution can afford two robots to play abusive house with.
[2:47:47] <$rdark_ksu> gold fish memory coming to the forefront here
[2:47:47] <+moranprime> And then 2B showed up and murdered everyone!@
[2:47:48] <GarbageQueenEllie> FORGETS
[2:47:48] <$GohanEgret> ITS AN ENDING, I think
[2:47:49] <alrobot2014> @PeachSaliva tell her about alice's drawing with her blood
[2:47:50] <LiquidMathew> THEY MENTION IT LATER IN THE GAME
[2:47:52] <Luesagna00> @peachsaliva his REAL KID is blonde
[2:47:53] <HannibalBeerus> BIG FORGET
[2:47:53] <OwlLightningMage> HE WASN'T ABUSING REAL PEOPLE
[2:47:54] <energywarning> it was like 2 months ago
[2:47:54] <Virokwet> i thought alice was a playmate for the sick kid
[2:47:55] <%krawtch> i love how the chemical composition of red ice is literally just cocaine
[2:47:56] <%Kataguro> It's in Alice's box of memories for some fucking reason
[2:47:56] <$joylent_blue> HE RANTS ABOUT HIS EX WIFE AT THE DINNER TABLE
[2:47:56] <circular7> you forgot
[2:47:57] <deviljhojho94> SHE IS LIKE KARA
[2:47:57] <leadenstrides> She saw it a while ago to be fair
[2:47:58] <deviljhojho94> SHE FORGOT
[2:47:59] <+Valison> 2
[2:47:59] <Sp3ctre48> Cause your memory is bad
[2:47:59] <theobble> YOU KNEW
[2:47:59] <mercado94> you dumb
[2:47:59] <%AncelDeLambert> @PeachSaliva Pat, you're doing the big spoils
[2:48:01] <%Skeletorexplains> and then 2B twerks on their corpses
[2:48:01] <+Walopoh> It's mentioned in dialogue
[2:48:02] <%emoonimoo> Because the photo was when the child was a toddler
[2:48:02] <OwlLightningMage> HE WAS BEATING HIS STRESS BALLS
[2:48:03] <booglesnurf> THATS RIGHT WOOLIE
[2:48:03] <+badchoice5> PAIGE IS IN NO CONDITION FOR THIS MUCH CAGE
[2:48:05] <+AXL808> Paige had her own mental block like Kara
[2:48:05] <%Kataguro> Memories of a family that isn't hers
[2:48:05] <leadenstrides> It was not clear
[2:48:06] <+cTAKU> BAIT AND SWITCH
[2:48:07] <Alpha820> You didn't notice it, BUT YOUR BRAIN DID.
[2:48:08] <OwlLightningMage> HE DID NOTHING WRONG
[2:48:08] <ExpendableComicRelief> cuz a lot of white kids are born with blonde hair but grow up to have brown
[2:48:09] <circular7> you took too long and forgot
[2:48:10] <PDS6400> FRUSTRATION IS GETTING BIGGER
[2:48:12] <DedlokPM> @PeachSaliva There were drawings of a blonde kid with todd and his wife and then drawings of Alice with brown hair
[2:48:12] <%krawtch> BLOODY LIES
[2:48:13] <lightsinx98> Todd was just using his property the way he wanted to
[2:48:16] <%TheMilhouseExperience> Too bad Paige killed Todd for NOTHING.
[2:48:16] <+SlightlySychotic> That was a red ring.
[2:48:16] <Dr_mr_wang> RED BLOOD
[2:48:18] <Gruhunchously> Lies
[2:48:19] <$rdark_ksu> big blood lie
[2:48:20] <deviljhojho94> BIG RETCON
[2:48:21] <%HorseChange> It's such dumb thing, you ignore it, and anything else just seems like there just may not be enough detail.
[2:48:21] <mercado94> Thats red oil
[2:48:21] <%SuichiTanaka> How did Alice have HOMEWORK?
[2:48:22] <sackerkappa> You know. You just don't want to see it.
[2:48:23] <AstroFalcon09> cage howard
[2:48:23] <gyrogogozeppeli> FOR FUCKS SAKE
[2:48:24] <%AncelDeLambert> LYING FUCKING PICTURE
[2:48:26] <reonome> you can deactivate it
[2:48:26] <leadenstrides> That was also a while ago
[2:48:28] <averagehero1> Todd and Griffin did nothing wrong and are the heros of justice
[2:48:28] <@SSaryn> A BIG FAT FUCKING LIE BY A FRENCH FUCK WHO LIKES THIRD ACT TWISTS TOO FUCKING MUCH
[2:48:29] <person181> kids can have them taken off
[2:48:29] <Maki_risu> LIES
[2:48:30] <+badchoice5> IT COMES OFF SO EASY ITS LIKE A STICKEr
[2:48:30] <omen_setter> The Cage'd egg has hatched
[2:48:32] <JDebss> it's literally a sticker
[2:48:34] <deviljhojho94> Christ
[2:48:34] <gyrogogozeppeli> I HATE THIS VIDEOGAME
[2:48:36] <LiquidMathew> Todd removed it for the illiusion
[2:48:36] <%Kataguro> But they don't bleed if you take it off, so that's nonsense
[2:48:37] <DrMoose7> the sticker fell off
[2:48:38] <%cherubsanonymous> So he could ABUSE HIS ROBOT CHILD
[2:48:38] <%Skeletorexplains> ROBOT SCHOOL
[2:48:38] <BioApple> Alice always has the blue thing I thought, Kara just ignored it because MOMMY,EXE
[2:48:39] <themagic_conch> IT WAS RIGHT THERE IN THE LAST SCENE
[2:48:39] <ExpendableComicRelief> @PeachSaliva They can turn it off.
[2:48:39] <Dragon_Batman> the weird thing is Alice drew a picture red blood. the blood came from the forehead where the led thing was
[2:48:40] <%Keyd00d> ROBOT HOMEWORK
[2:48:40] <Gruhunchously> This is so bad
[2:48:41] <Graxe_> Kid robots can have them removed.
[2:48:41] <deviljhojho94> WAIT, YEAH
[2:48:42] <%shozent> BUT WHY DOES IT COME BACK?
[2:48:43] <Bouldus> she drew a picture of him removing the led thing
[2:48:43] <Sp3ctre48> She had fake homework
[2:48:43] <$spire6> "Don't trust his lies" on the back of David Cage's photo
[2:48:43] <deviljhojho94> WHAT THE FUCK
[2:48:45] <OwlLightningMage> SHE HAD HOMEWORK
[2:48:45] <booglesnurf> thanks I hate it
[2:48:45] <Endocrom> He's still abusing a thing that represents a child, it's like psychos and torturing animals
[2:48:47] <ExpendableComicRelief> The kid robots can turn their LEDs off.
[2:48:49] <Nova712> she still has the blue icon...
[2:48:52] <%krawtch> watch me eat this spaghet, dollies.
[2:48:53] <3InchMensch> IT WAS REMOVED TO MAKE HER MORE LIKE A R E A L G I R L
[2:48:53] <Dr_mr_wang> HOMEWORK
[2:48:54] <%MechaBaphomet> @PeachSaliva The LEDS are optional on the kid androids
[2:48:54] <+JenovasPuppet> Running Homework Program
[2:48:54] <The_Esquana> he printed out problems from coolmathdotcom
[2:48:54] <GarbageQueenEllie> THE BITCH DON'T EVEN EAT
[2:48:55] <LiquidMathew> THEY CAN EAT
[2:48:55] <Mirrorcatch> this director is recognized by tedtalks by the way
[2:48:57] <@SSaryn> They eat Spaget
[2:48:58] <%Kataguro> It's like one of those hair-eating dolls
[2:48:59] <averagehero1> Robo homework am I right
[2:49:00] <+cvp5127> todd did nothing wrong
[2:49:00] <Nova712> they can disable the blue icon off
[2:49:02] <$rdark_ksu> literally wasted food. literally
[2:49:04] <alrobot2014> FEED HER MACKREL
[2:49:04] <omen_setter> this was really well thought out
[2:49:04] <Jontman42> He just eats both plates, that's why he's the fat evil
[2:49:04] <reonome> yeah they can turn it off
[2:49:05] <gyrogogozeppeli> YOURE WASTING SPHAGETTI FOR A ROBOT
[2:49:05] <$Sphincter_Spelunker> I thought it was there the whole time and Kara never saw it. Out of denial
[2:49:06] <%Kataguro> What?
[2:49:06] <%Skeletorexplains> Spaghetti is the national food of all robots.
[2:49:07] <doofmaster> A good plot twist ADDS meaning to everything prior
[2:49:07] <Worldbrand> That's actually even dumber
[2:49:07] <OwlLightningMage> SHE WAS LYING THE WHOLE TIME
[2:49:08] <prime_name> YOU CAN TURN IT OFF?!
[2:49:09] <Dr_mr_wang> BULLSHIT
[2:49:09] <missingangle> No?
[2:49:10] <AlasterAngelo> OF THE ROBOTS JUST WORK - Todd
[2:49:12] <OwlLightningMage> IT'S SO STUPID
[2:49:12] <+badchoice5> BECOME AS A GOD PAIGE
[2:49:12] <circular7> he was literally playing with his "dolls"
[2:49:14] <JDebss> Free Todd now!
[2:49:14] <Hadley> Wtf they can turn it off?
[2:49:14] <+OceanGovernor> LUL he ate both plates
[2:49:15] <mercado94> BULLSHIT
[2:49:16] <+Elexius> Because its a David Cage game, and every Cage game needs a FUCK YOU plot twist.
[2:49:17] <%Kataguro> I'm pretty sure that's not true
[2:49:18] <$Dutchpotato> that's wrong
[2:49:18] <Zalthia> You know what would fix this? If Alice TOLD Kara she was an Android in this scene, instead of her finding out.
[2:49:18] <averagehero1> HE EATS HER FOOD CAUSE HES FAT
[2:49:18] <VanLynx> HE'S POOR WHY MAKE MORE MEALS THAN NECESSARY
[2:49:18] <%lethallunacyx> Todd is a standup individual, just minding his own business doing his drugs and beating his machines
[2:49:19] <%AncelDeLambert> but then why the picture showing a head wound where the LED is?
[2:49:20] <+smargh1015> BOXED LUNCHES BIG BRO
[2:49:20] <ExpendableComicRelief> Yeah you can, it mentions it in a magazine
[2:49:21] <MrDonTacos_> 10/10 WRITING LUL
[2:49:22] <%NWR_James> BULLSHIT! THE LED IS A SECURITY FEATURE
[2:49:22] <%Keyd00d> "pretty good"
[2:49:22] <Dragon_Batman> no I'm pretty shure Todd ripped it off
[2:49:23] <%Skeletorexplains> THE BABY
[2:49:25] <+Brovdig> Did paige gun down todd?
[2:49:25] <Dr_mr_wang> YOU DON'T EVEN HAVE TO REMOVE IT?
[2:49:25] <TheZombiepope> Maybe she was just a therapy tool for Todd to get over his abusive behavior
[2:49:26] <%HorseChange> WOULD IT HAVE BEEN BETTER IF: Kara knew the entire time. Am I too hopeful?
[2:49:27] <st_jimmy456> it just cuts it out
[2:49:28] <+Walopoh> The childhood drawing was the led getting ripped off but she drew the blood red instead of blue
[2:49:28] <@CoalSavoie> No, there's a picture of Alice with her head bleeding is of the LED being removed
[2:49:29] <deviljhojho94> YOU CANT EVER ESCAPE THE CAGE
[2:49:29] <DedlokPM> @PeachSaliva Kara and Marcus just tore off their LEDs. Todd probably took hers off to look more like a hooman
[2:49:30] <Virokwet> no they cant, why else would they be ripping it off thier heands?
[2:49:31] <%Freelance7> It makes it less interesting
[2:49:33] <%TheMilhouseExperience> PAIGE is in a RAGE with the CAGE!
[2:49:34] <deviljhojho94> YOU WERE ALWAYS INSIDE THE CAGE
[2:49:34] <+AXL808> she felt no love at all...
[2:49:35] <+moranprime> Ending S[P]aghetti
[2:49:35] <%Keyd00d> The game's pretty good, only 1/3 of it is tolerable
[2:49:35] <OwlLightningMage> A ROBOT LOVING A ROBOT MEANS NOTHING
[2:49:37] <+SlightlySychotic> Kara could be completely removed from the game with no consequence.
[2:49:37] <+smargh1015> Kara is a total waste of time
[2:49:37] <brambobelurkin> THEY CAN JUST FUCKING LOOK NORMAL WITHOUT RIPPING IT OFF?
[2:49:37] <%Logan_Jennings1> I makes it FUCKING POINTLESS
[2:49:38] <%SiameseSneeze> Did I miss the fucking end?
[2:49:39] <sackerkappa> Here's the trick question: Does Alice like Kara for real or was she programmed to like her?
[2:49:40] <Hadley> She made that picture with her head bleeding so I assumed Todd removed her LED
[2:49:40] <missingangle> Connor: A+, Marcus C, Kara: F----
[2:49:41] <%krawtch> literally any defense for this terrible twist boils down to "BECAUSE, OKAY? SHUT UP"
[2:49:41] <%SausageShogunate> the whole game should've just been aConnor and Hank buddy cop comedy
[2:49:42] <%NWR_James> @CoalSavoie BUT ITS HERE NOW
[2:49:42] <$GohanEgret> It would be more interesting if Kara never knew
[2:49:44] <$rdark_ksu> Kara i'm cold. No you are not you literal example of a lie
[2:49:45] <ExpendableComicRelief> @NWR_James It's in one of the magazines, they can disable it in the kid lines.
[2:49:45] <Gruhunchously> Can a robot care for another robot
[2:49:45] <Laecerelius> I bet Tod is an Android too
[2:49:45] <MelodicCello> Honestly, just the fact that there are androids that are built to imitate A CHILD in this world is the most fucked up part about it. mathsquadNoDad
[2:49:49] <Luesagna00> @peachsaliva this is like fucking like the origami killer reveal fucking scene
[2:49:52] <+badchoice5> "Alice we called it" LUL
[2:49:52] <%Kataguro> Why would she?
[2:49:53] <%ZeOrbling> KARA ALREADY KNEW
[2:49:53] <OwlLightningMage> BECAUSE THE STORY IS STUPID
[2:49:53] <+skizzuto> Is Alice even deviant?
[2:49:53] <+cvp5127> his alice deviant?
[2:49:53] <+sana_kan> because alice isn't deviant I guess?
[2:49:54] <ithonmage> Children don't have souls
[2:49:55] <%Skeletorexplains> I thought the bitch went crazy with Mom.exe
[2:49:56] <Angry_Ev1L> IS ALICE EVEN A DEVIANT?\
[2:49:57] <%Freelance7> KARA DID KNOW
[2:49:58] <%krawtch> alice lies to put kara in danger
[2:49:58] <sosuke5> And Todd runs Asshole.exe
[2:49:59] <MSN04_Sazabi> ALICE IS NOT A DEVIANT SHE IS NOT SELF-AWARE
[2:50:00] <+smargh1015> is alice even deviant?
[2:50:00] <%lethallunacyx> stupid child .exe
[2:50:00] <GarbageQueenEllie> @MelodicCello YES
[2:50:00] <reonome> @CoalSavoie thats just a lying picture, in the character viewer they tell you child android leds can be deactivated
[2:50:01] <Graxe_> @PeachSaliva And Kara knew the entire time that Alice was a robot. Kara decided not to believe it.
[2:50:02] <OwlLightningMage> KARA IS STUPID
[2:50:03] <gyrogogozeppeli> YES
[2:50:04] <%legendfather_of_giants> @PeachSaliva she doesnt want to admit it
[2:50:04] <Gruhunchously> She repressed the memory
[2:50:05] <TheA1ternative> KARA CHOSE TO FORGET
[2:50:05] <$GohanEgret> willful ignorance
[2:50:05] <+dansinginthestreet> my brain just swapped kara for chara
[2:50:05] <Dragon_Batman> Kara was in denial the whole time
[2:50:05] <%galaxyswirl> @PeachSaliva you actually see a magazine for an alice bot at the beginning of the game
[2:50:06] <themagic_conch> she didnt want to know
[2:50:06] <%Ell1ot> i would've liked it if the little girl was a Hooman
[2:50:06] <LiquidMathew> SHE MENTAL BLOCKED IT
[2:50:06] <%HorseChange> It's a twist that Kara has been lying to herself and Alice willfully, because she wanted Alice to feel accepted among the humans?
[2:50:07] <The_Esquana> SHE CHOSE TO NOT AGKNOWLEDGE THE GLOWING LED
[2:50:07] <averagehero1> Child android is a super weapon that's the real plot twist
[2:50:07] <OwlLightningMage> IT'S SO STUPID
[2:50:09] <+badchoice5> CAGE LIED TO YOU
[2:50:09] <%AncelDeLambert> Alice can only be considered deviant if she shoots Todd
[2:50:09] <%king_wragles> @PeachSaliva YOU'RE ACTUALLY ABOUT TO FIND OUT WHY ALICE DID THE THING
[2:50:10] <Sp3ctre48> It's such a pointless twist, the game would have been fine without it
[2:50:12] <Endocrom> There's also the possibility that Alice might not even BE a deviant
[2:50:12] <%Toynota10> NO SHUT UP
[2:50:12] <+AXL808> Kara blocked her own mind
[2:50:13] <blackbaron98> STOOPID
[2:50:13] <Bouldus> Kara read the receipt for alace @PeachSaliva
[2:50:13] <booglesnurf> Davidcage dot exe
[2:50:13] <$rdark_ksu> Why do you keep feeding me? This pasta is tangling my servos
[2:50:13] <gyrogogozeppeli> SHE WAS DEVIANT BEFORE SHE WAS ACTUALLY DEVIANT
[2:50:15] <%Logan_Jennings1> THE GAME SAID NO YOU DON'T KNOW
[2:50:15] <%skm742> WHY DID LUTHER PREPARE A SPEECH?!?!?
[2:50:15] <mercado94> It was againts the Prime Directive
[2:50:16] <+barretzm> I don't think Alice is a deviant
[2:50:16] <+sana_kan> it seems like the game implies that alice is basically just a regular ass android that has no actual autonomy unlike kara or markus
[2:50:16] <Jontman42> She wanted to believe
[2:50:17] <%Keyd00d> BUT!
[2:50:17] <+moranprime> Bad writing is bad
[2:50:17] <%TheMilhouseExperience> She repressed her memory because REASONS.
[2:50:18] <+badchoice5> YOU GOT CAGED
[2:50:18] <Klarrann3> THE MAGAZINE IN TODD'S ROOM
[2:50:18] <+smargh1015> just like manfred in HR
[2:50:18] <averagehero1> Kara just ignored it the WHOLE time
[2:50:20] <%MightyMaxT> What if Child Androids were programmed to think they're real
[2:50:20] <LiquidMathew> SHE BLOCKED IT
[2:50:21] <$SubjectTea> NO SHUT UP PAIGE
[2:50:21] <Hadley> She forgot because PLOT
[2:50:21] <%Kataguro> I must take care of CHILD because I am VVYMYN
[2:50:23] <BioApple> The evidence seems to suggest children are deliberately programmed to not know they are robots, which makes no sense
[2:50:25] <arcaderabbit48> Kara was like "Dont let it set in"
[2:50:25] <+JenovasPuppet> Eet mahks sehns!
[2:50:27] <captainspauldin> lol
[2:50:27] <%emoonimoo> I was under the impression at first that Alice had no idea she was a robot and that's why she acted all helpless and shit
[2:50:27] <+Hilleltaco> She just didn't want to SEE IT maaaaan, such a good TWIST maaaaan ResidentSleeper
[2:50:27] <Gruhunchously> Is Alice a deviant?
[2:50:28] <%Divryne> GET CAGED BEEYATCH.
[2:50:29] <%duneblythe> alice didn't want to be rejected
[2:50:29] <Chalupa2474> good Lord this is disappointing
[2:50:30] <%HorseChange> REMEMBER HER DREAM OF THE UNICORN
[2:50:30] <Maki_risu> SELECTIVE MEMORY, BUT FOR ROBOTS
[2:50:31] <booglesnurf> Is that the script over there?
[2:50:32] <gyrogogozeppeli> SHE WAS DEVIANT BEFORE SHE WAS ACTUALLY DEVIANT!
[2:50:35] <%lethallunacyx> so then Kara is inferior to people
[2:50:36] <DedlokPM> @PeachSaliva She saw the magazine, knew, but then was like "She needs me to protect her. So I will think of her as hooman"
[2:50:36] <PDS6400> That's Right Jay!
[2:50:37] <Luesagna00> @peachsaliva she IS THE REAAL ORIGAMI KILLER
[2:50:37] <californaya> Paige is such a mood right now
[2:50:38] <circular7> she wanted to be a mommy
[2:50:38] <st_jimmy456> it's okay to be mad. it's fucking awful
[2:50:40] <+AXL808> The magazine is blurred out
[2:50:40] <+moranprime> Can we punch giant bugs in a office again Pat?
[2:50:41] <Dr_mr_wang> is Alice deviant? i guess she's whatever the script needs her to be, what's that? is that the script?
[2:50:43] <%krawtch> how come the police report didnt mention two androids.
[2:50:44] <deviljhojho94> Christ
[2:50:45] <averagehero1> Kara ignored the rampaging elephant in the room
[2:50:46] <%Skeletorexplains> STOLEN CHILD
[2:50:47] <3InchMensch> THIS MEANS KARA HAD TO HAVE BEEN A DEVIANT FROM THE MOMENT SHE WAS REACTIVATED
[2:50:47] <ExpendableComicRelief> OMEGALUL
[2:50:48] <MrDonTacos_> The answer to every "but?" question is: CAGE LUL
[2:50:49] <%HorseChange> That's right Susan!
[2:50:51] <%king_wragles> stolen robot
[2:50:52] <Dragon_Batman> because that would give the twist away
[2:50:53] <%NWR_James> PLAY OMIKRON
[2:50:54] <LiquidMathew> BECAUSE TODD REMOVED THE LED
[2:50:54] <%Skeletorexplains> I OWN THIS CHILD
[2:50:56] <gyrogogozeppeli> NotLikeThis NotLikeThis NotLikeThis NotLikeThis NotLikeThis NotLikeThis NotLikeThis NotLikeThis NotLikeThis NotLikeThis NotLikeThis NotLikeThis NotLikeThis
[2:50:56] <deviljhojho94> WELCOME TO THE CAGE
[2:50:59] <fingalights> Uh, umm. cause she wasn't on record?
[2:50:59] <%TheMilhouseExperience> And Todd died for Nothing.
[2:51:00] <%krawtch> if both of your TVs get stolen, do you only report one of them?
[2:51:01] <lightsinx98> Kara wholes story is a literal waste of time
[2:51:01] <%AncelDeLambert> god Cage is garbage
[2:51:02] <%juxtest> Connor was also in denial about Alice being an android
[2:51:02] <%king_wragles> stolen CHILD robot
[2:51:03] <Mirrorcatch> LIES
[2:51:07] <%lethallunacyx> but then again people also ignore truths
[2:51:07] <+angelofsparta1> i love your feet @subliminalmessages
[2:51:10] <+cvp5127> he tried
[2:51:10] <%HorseChange> Was Luther just building up that big speech?
[2:51:12] <averagehero1> TODD BOUGHT A MINI TOASTER CHILD
[2:51:13] <gyrogogozeppeli> LUTHER DONT ENABLE HER
[2:51:14] <%Rhinoprotoss> Luther tried
[2:51:17] <booglesnurf> Is robo Alice replacing fambily?
[2:51:18] <Estuko> Luther: I thought this was an open RP
[2:51:19] <$rdark_ksu> Luther didnt want to get stabbed by a crazy bitch in his sleep
[2:51:19] <DatAsuna> He actually isn't
[2:51:19] <+Sinister_Aglet> Luther thought it was funny
[2:51:20] <+timblenaut> Luther tries to tell her
[2:51:21] <%MightyMaxT> He "tries" a couple times
[2:51:21] <%Logan_Jennings1> He tried a few times but not very hard
[2:51:23] <3InchMensch> He did try a few times to tell Kara
[2:51:24] <BioApple> JERRY JERICHO
[2:51:25] <DatAsuna> He tries to tell her IN THAT SCENE
[2:51:26] <%cherubsanonymous> This is everything I hoped it would be
[2:51:26] <RollCritFail> Luther is playing along Just for Alice and Kara <3
[2:51:27] <%Skeletorexplains> WE GOTTA HELP THIS CHILD SMILE
[2:51:27] <%Kataguro> He keeps trying to because Kara is legitimately crazy
[2:51:27] <$joylent_blue> JERRY OF THE RIVER
[2:51:29] <%Keyd00d> JERRY
[2:51:29] <@SSaryn> DON'T WORRY ABOUT IT
[2:51:29] <%Plutt_bug> BRAVE LITTLE TOASTER WAS THE FIRST DEVIANT!!!
[2:51:31] <+barretzm> Luther likes crazy bitches
[2:51:31] <%Yumonikki> Jerry.
[2:51:32] <LiquidMathew> Jerrys are kinda dumb
[2:51:32] <clonexsniperx> everyone knows
[2:51:33] <DatAsuna> Kara's just a bitch
[2:51:33] <%king_wragles> TODD BOUGHT ROBOTS TO TURN ON HIS VACUUM ROBOT
[2:51:33] <+moranprime> Because bad writing
[2:51:33] <$spire6> Luther lies: A WH40K story
[2:51:33] <%HorseChange> OH GOD. Luther.. Ending speech about connections between people.... Please no
[2:51:34] <%AncelDeLambert> Luther is an idiot, he has no reason to actually go along with Kara's crap
[2:51:34] <%Logan_Jennings1> No
[2:51:34] <DedlokPM> @PeachSaliva HE TRIED TO TELL HER> MANY TIMES! BUT KARA KEPT SAYING "WE WILL TALK LATER!"
[2:51:35] <OwlLightningMage> EVERYONE KNOW AND SAID NOTHING
[2:51:35] <%lethallunacyx> probably
[2:51:36] <energywarning> luther did nothing wrong. don't you bring him into this
[2:51:36] <+AXL808> he pitted Kara
[2:51:37] <arcaderabbit48> Its actually really creepy when you start peeling the layers back. Like, Kara is broken as a person and Luthor just goes along with her delusions
[2:51:38] <OwlLightningMage> IT'S SO STUPID
[2:51:39] <+badchoice5> THEY CAN SPEAK MIND-TO-MIND
[2:51:40] <Maki_risu> He ''''''tries'''' but then zombie Jerry's
[2:51:41] <mercado94> yes
[2:51:43] <OwlLightningMage> THERE ARE ONLY A FEW
[2:51:44] <JDebss> Todd didn't know they're sentient either so not evil.
[2:51:45] <sackerkappa> Luther even tried telling Kara about Alice but then was stopped.
[2:51:46] <+JenovasPuppet> "It's been so long since we've seen one!"
[2:51:47] <Graxe_> Robots can still freeze, like the Jerries. Sure they don't need shelter, but they need some minimal warmth.
[2:51:50] <Dragon_Batman> I don't think those guys knew a dam thing
[2:51:52] <averagehero1> Jerry needes customers even if they aren't real children
[2:51:52] <Ropcord> SAVIN' THAT BUDGET
[2:51:54] <%Skeletorexplains> 1-3 black guys
[2:51:56] <%Skeletorexplains> 1 markus
[2:51:56] <C_Parkesy> Yo Chat! Yo @peachsaliva ! How's the stream going?
[2:51:57] <%TheMilhouseExperience> and then Conner and Markus.
[2:51:58] <circular7> Jerry may or may not have known, Luther definitely knew
[2:52:01] <booglesnurf> All androids look the same
[2:52:02] <Laironx3> Luther wanted to warn you about the dumb plot twist.
[2:52:03] <@SSaryn> And we maybe only see like 30-50 different types in the game.
[2:52:06] <OwlLightningMage> EVERYONE KNEW
[2:52:08] <%duneblythe> Jerry didn't know shit
[2:52:08] <%krawtch> kara runs away from luthers information because thats how you keep a plot point in suspension
[2:52:10] <+Walopoh> BARE MINIMUM OF BLACK GUYS
[2:52:11] <DedlokPM> Androids are "cheap"
[2:52:12] <Bouldus> robots are like 600 bucks
[2:52:14] <%TheMilhouseExperience> Welfare.
[2:52:14] <gyrogogozeppeli> IT MAKES NO FUCKING SENSE ALL FOR THAT SHITTY TWIST
[2:52:15] <OwlLightningMage> ANDROIDS ARE CHEAP SHUT UP
[2:52:15] <+badchoice5> THEY LITERALLY HAVE A TELEPATHIC CONNECTION
[2:52:16] <%HorseChange> LUTHER provides the most insiteful SPEECH in the game.
[2:52:16] <lightsinx98> HE IS A TAXI DRIVER
[2:52:17] <GarbageQueenEllie> He just spends all his cash on VICTIMS
[2:52:19] <%MrBorisMakarov> welfare
[2:52:19] <+cvp5127> AND DRUGS
[2:52:20] <Graxe_> And the Roomba.
[2:52:20] <%linSP> ALICE IS SELF AWARE, YOU GUYS ALL SUCK AND DAVID IS A GENIUS

[2:52:24] <Sp3ctre48> He's a drug dealer
[2:52:24] <%lethallunacyx> He does his thing
[2:52:24] <%badmr7> AND ALSO DRUGS
[2:52:25] <foreverN2dust> Maybe that is WHY he is destitute?
[2:52:26] <Worldbrand> Yeah but housing in detroit aint exactly tough to come by
[2:52:26] <+BoboDaHobo> Selling drugs
[2:52:26] <%SiameseSneeze> homeless, except he has a home
[2:52:27] <SubliminaIMessages> :p
[2:52:27] <%NWR_James> robots are stupid cheap
[2:52:27] <SpellCatty> Kara costed like the same as an Xbox One with inflation
[2:52:27] <Dragon_Batman> and then repairs that robot
[2:52:27] <%Plutt_bug> Drug trafficking is good money
[2:52:28] <%krawtch> can a MICROWAVE take care of a CALCULATOR
[2:52:28] <%lethallunacyx> don't judge
[2:52:29] <gyrogogozeppeli> ITS A STUPID TWIST
[2:52:29] <ExpendableComicRelief> for the same reason poor people have massive TVs
[2:52:29] <LiquidMathew> DRUG MONEY
[2:52:30] <Xelhesia> AND HE GET THE METH
[2:52:30] <poweredscoot> Turn off the baby robot

[2:52:31] <Ropcord> jesus christ david LUL
[2:52:31] <OwlLightningMage> SHE WAS HUNGRY AND COLD
[2:52:33] <%Kataguro> He sold a shitty manual taxi in a world of self-driving cars somehow
[2:52:33] <prime_name> AND THE ECONOMY IS IN SHAMBLES
[2:52:34] <Gruhunchously> It's SO stupid.
[2:52:34] <%sleepy_coffee> ....wat

[2:52:36] <Bouldus> @PeachSaliva Kara is literally a $700 model
[2:52:36] <%AncelDeLambert> AND he repairs the robot he destroyed
[2:52:36] <3InchMensch> I mean, not like he has to spend money on food for the child robOH WAIT
[2:52:39] <%emoonimoo> He's super fucking broke but can afford two fucking androids, drugs AND a roomba
[2:52:40] <SailingSaturn> He has 3 robots LUL
[2:52:40] <%Logan_Jennings1> NO SHUT UP, HE'S EVIL OKAY
[2:52:41] <averagehero1> Look the point is that this game is really stupid and should have won best narrative
[2:52:41] <Maki_risu> In cripplin' dept on red meth
[2:52:42] <Graxe_> He got an android to turn on the Roomba.
[2:52:42] <+MildMannered> because drugs
[2:52:43] <circular7> homeless robot either didn't know or knew and played along
[2:52:44] <@SSaryn> Da Red Ice
[2:52:45] <%Ez3z> the two of them together is probably the same as a couple of smartphones and/or TVs
[2:52:45] <%lethallunacyx> he got his side business
[2:52:46] <+cTAKU> so 80's
[2:52:47] <JDebss> then she turns on the robot vaccum
[2:52:47] <OwlLightningMage> HE WAS REPARING THE STRESS BALL
[2:52:47] <Ropcord> what number do we spam when it's david cage's fault?
[2:52:47] <Jontman42> Maybe he gets the robot as treatment for mental health issues or whatever
[2:52:48] <Gruhunchously> It's stupidity all the way down.
[2:52:48] <Luesagna00> @peachsaliva there are loan bills ya can find i the house
[2:52:48] <mercado94> do androids come with DLC?
[2:52:49] <+SlightlySychotic> Was Todd screwing Kara?
[2:52:52] <%AncelDeLambert> Todd's story would have been SO MUCH more interesting than this Kara shit
[2:52:52] <GarbageQueenEllie> YES THERE FUCKING IS
[2:52:53] <%krawtch> turns out the drug doesnt matter so they dont ever bring it up
[2:52:53] <The_Esquana> no Paige, don't think, just play
[2:52:54] <+AXL808> red herring
[2:52:54] <Laecerelius> Androids cost only like $10
[2:52:55] <%Skeletorexplains> THE DRUGS ARE MADE OF CHILDREN!!!!!
[2:52:55] <+pleasenameyourcharacter> That's fucked up american wellfare for ya.
[2:52:55] <%heyitsbrian> CAPS LOCK IS CRUISE CONTROL FOR COOL
[2:52:56] <arcaderabbit48> Yeah, Red Ice just kinda stops mattering.
[2:52:57] <%Toynota10> Have there been any interviews with David Cage about this?
[2:52:58] <%HorseChange> Drugs are bad
[2:53:00] <@CoalSavoie> If he IS a dealer, he's a shitty one
[2:53:01] <Dr_mr_wang> she never found the drugs
[2:53:01] <Huntercd> I am remembering why I hate this and Cage
[2:53:02] <leadenstrides> He also spends a lot of money on drugs.
[2:53:03] <Chalupa2474> LOL @ROOMBA HAHA
[2:53:04] <TheA1ternative> CARLS SON IS ON RED ICE
[2:53:04] <LiquidMathew> Its just a background detail
[2:53:05] <+FrostMass22> The drugs don't matter
[2:53:06] <Neo_Kaiser> and they have a roomba
[2:53:08] <%DOOOOOOOO000OOM> THE DRUGS PLOT GOES NOWHERE
[2:53:08] <+AXL808> drugs just a red herring
[2:53:11] <%emoonimoo> Red Ice is mentioned a small amount of times
[2:53:12] <californaya> is it????
[2:53:12] <%lethallunacyx> gotta get that red ice
[2:53:13] <+cvp5127> ZLATKO
[2:53:14] <person181> connors first case had some laying around
[2:53:14] <averagehero1> After the first act red ice becomes nonexistent
[2:53:15] <@SSaryn> IT'S ALMOST LIKE THEY SHOULD HAVE FOLLOWED THAT ONE PLOT LINE INSTEAD OF NOT AT ALL
[2:53:16] <%Rhinoprotoss> It's part of Hank's child death thing
[2:53:16] <+Joey_JoestarXD> It was probably dreoppped
[2:53:16] <Twoiis> There is another important one.
[2:53:18] <$rdark_ksu> The unemployment is like 40% what else you gonna do but get high?
[2:53:18] <+badchoice5> But no, Sex Bots
[2:53:18] <+walternatorz> they were harvesting them
[2:53:20] <+Blankets_and_Tea> this game's just like "yeah drugs are a think i guess"
[2:53:21] <BioApple> Androids are cheaper than my PC, do you think I could get Doom to run on one?
[2:53:21] <Gruhunchously> Kind of like how impending World War 3 just stops being important
[2:53:21] <%HorseChange> It's "world building".
[2:53:21] <Mr_Strut> Needs more super meth
[2:53:22] <$Sphincter_Spelunker> Probably wasn't Cage's idea is why it's interesting
[2:53:22] <%krawtch> despite containing "android blood" its chemical composition is the same as cocaine
[2:53:22] <+walternatorz> zlatko
[2:53:26] <G_Lancaster> harvesting thing is literally deus ex @PeachSaliva
[2:53:26] <%Logan_Jennings1> This game has so much potential to be interesting and does nothing with it.
[2:53:28] <+SlightlySychotic> I mean, it would make more sense if Todd was screwing Kara. Full surrogate family thing.
[2:53:38] <%krawtch> zlatko did nothing wrong
[2:53:39] <averagehero1> SCREW ROBO DRUGS WE NEED ROBO RIGHTS
[2:53:40] <TalisKanju> Did Paige finish Detroit?
[2:53:40] <booglesnurf> THATS RIGHT COLLIN
[2:53:41] <circular7> drugs are bad - cage
[2:53:42] <%lethallunacyx> shhh don't think
[2:53:42] <$joylent_blue> ITS ALMOST LIKE THERE COULD BE A BETTER GAME HIDDEN IN THIS SHIT
[2:53:44] <deviljhojho94> This is fucked
[2:53:44] <%HorseChange> YES PAIGE
[2:53:44] <gyrogogozeppeli> LUL
[2:53:45] <+cvp5127> is alice even a deviant?
[2:53:46] <Graxe_> The drug plot goes nowhere, just like the Arctic conflict with Russia.
[2:53:47] <gyrogogozeppeli> AS YOU SHOULD
[2:53:48] <+Hilleltaco> At least there's always Connor
[2:53:48] <%krawtch> all fat evils are just fat neutrals
[2:53:49] <Mr_Strut> This is why you enslave the robots
[2:53:49] <californaya> That's the spirit!
[2:53:51] <%AncelDeLambert> No, Zlatko liked modifying shit
[2:53:51] <themagic_conch> luthers cool tho
[2:53:51] <reonome> care about connor
[2:53:51] <$Sphincter_Spelunker> Or it was Cage's idea and he can't execute for shit
[2:53:51] <Mirrorcatch> probably edited out that red ice is supernatural or whatever
[2:53:52] <Ropcord> HEY CONNOR IS COOL
[2:53:53] <averagehero1> Good paige good
[2:53:56] <%TheMilhouseExperience> Rage against the Cage.
[2:53:57] <MrDonTacos_> THIS IS IT BOYS, THE TRUE DAVID CAGE EXPERIENCE LUL
[2:53:57] <Dr_mr_wang> DUMP ALICE IN THE TRASH
[2:53:58] <Hadley> Don't comfort the child
[2:53:58] <Laecerelius> There’s a dump full of robots full of precious drug materials
[2:53:58] <+smargh1015> oh boy is it
[2:53:59] <%lethallunacyx> FUN!
[2:54:02] <+JenovasPuppet> Yes
[2:54:02] <DatAsuna> Alice is deviant since before kara
[2:54:02] <3InchMensch> IS SHE?
[2:54:03] <+LumberjackJack> Ugh, don't remind me of ME3 again BibleThump
[2:54:03] <OwlLightningMage> MASS EFFECT 3'S ENDING IS TRASH
[2:54:04] <Dragon_Batman> kinda yea
[2:54:04] <fingalights> Maybe?
[2:54:05] <%Kataguro> Maybe
[2:54:05] <alrobot2014> TELL ME ABOUT THE SHEPARD
[2:54:06] <%krawtch> FAT NEUTRALS
[2:54:07] <+ThatGuyfromMars> Connor is best boy
[2:54:07] <MSN04_Sazabi> IS SHE???
[2:54:09] <%AncelDeLambert> we don't know
[2:54:09] <%Plutt_bug> FUCK THIS
[2:54:10] <+KevinsLunchbox> Kara tells Zlatko Alice is human and Zlatkos reaction is "holy shit this robot is deviant as fuck!"
[2:54:10] <Luesagna00> @peachsaliva just as bad as origami killer reveal
[2:54:10] <PDS6400> THAT'S RIGHT JAY
[2:54:11] <JDebss> Naw
[2:54:12] <GarbageQueenEllie> Kara was in denial cause she knows it's just as much bullshit as you do
[2:54:12] <DatAsuna> yes she is
[2:54:14] <deviljhojho94> I WILL NEVER NOT BE MAD ABOUT ME3
[2:54:14] <mercado94> BIG MAYBE
[2:54:14] <theobble> Alice kept it a secret intentionally because she was "afraid kara wouldn't love me anymore" (ACTUAL QUOTE IN GAME)
[2:54:14] <$rdark_ksu> got hit so hard she got awakened
[2:54:15] <%HorseChange> this ending ages really poorly. Damn
[2:54:15] <+JenovasPuppet> Alice couldn't have left her master if she wasn't a deviant
[2:54:16] <fingalights> But they don't know about her
[2:54:16] <DracaenaLeaf> She probably isn't a deviant, but acts like a child any way
[2:54:16] <gyrogogozeppeli> LUL
[2:54:16] <$Sphincter_Spelunker> The only good part of ME3 is the horde mode
[2:54:16] <AlasterAngelo> THAT'S RIGHT JAY
[2:54:17] <Estuko> She turned deviant when Todd performed Raging Demon on her
[2:54:17] <%MrBorisMakarov> alice is deviant but couldn't really do anything about it
[2:54:17] <DatAsuna> She leaves you notes and shit
[2:54:17] <3InchMensch> PAT'S RIGHT!
[2:54:19] <%Keyd00d> GOOD

[2:54:22] <%SuichiTanaka> LUL
[2:54:23] <BioApple> They wouldn't locate Alice since she wasn't on the police report as an android
[2:54:23] <RantingRavager> THAT'S RIGHT JAY
[2:54:24] <OwlLightningMage> MASS EFFECT 3'S ENDING GETS WORSE THE MORE YOU THINK ABOUT IT
[2:54:24] <%Yumonikki> YOU HAVE TO

[3:23:14] <nepwar> paige avoided going to patsuwich
[3:23:14] <theobble> i wanted the robo camp
[3:23:15] <negativejam> THEY'RE DOING THEIR JOB AT RECLYCING PLASTIC TOASTERS FeelsBadMan
[3:23:15] <averagehero1> You go to the scrap yard
[3:23:16] <Gruhunchously> There is no message. Judge me by my work.
[3:23:16] <+JenovasPuppet> GAME ABOUT NOTHING

[3:23:28] <%krawtch> you dont wake up in a mass grave
[3:23:28] <negativejam> AND GOT KILLED FOR IT FeelsBadMan
[3:23:28] <TalisKanju> Paige has that bloodlust
[3:23:30] <lightsinx98> this game is about plastic people being better than normal dudes
[3:23:30] <GarbageQueenEllie> This isn't a game about nothing. SEINFELD is a game about nothing
[3:23:33] <+sana_kan> I mean it's so muddled there really isn't anyway
[3:23:34] <%krawtch> there isnt a concentration camp
[3:23:36] <Dr_mr_wang> no message, now get in the robot ovens
[3:23:41] <+smargh1015> is David cage a bigger coward than Todd?
[3:23:46] <baronvonkame> the weirder options work out because cage HAD to make a scenario where everyone lives; thus all characters with a "save" option must be a QTE to save
[3:23:49] <+pleasenameyourcharacter> A moment of silence for our American heroes who died trying to stop the toaster menace...
[3:23:51] <lightsinx98> There IS a concentration camp
[3:23:52] <Laironx3> It's about nothing and everything
[3:23:52] <negativejam> THIS ISN'T ABOUT RACE! - David Cage screams into the sky
[3:23:53] <LifesNeverHumDrum> it still bothers me to no end that the concentraion camp and checkpoint are the same scene structure
[3:24:00] <snake_zen> R1
[3:24:00] <nepwar> i mean to be fair, its just a giant recycling plant
[3:24:01] <Dragonfang1337> everyone is here
[3:24:05] <PanicSwytch> NOT ABOUT CIVIL RIGHTS, EQUALITY, GENOCIDE OR HATE
[3:24:06] <BioApple> I hope this game doesn't have a message because right now its message seems to be "concentration camps are illogical, just shoot all your enemies asap"
[3:24:06] <%happyface699> @negativejam Toasters fuck ovens
[3:24:06] <+moranprime> Story boarding this game must've been a nightmare.
[3:24:09] <Hydrapissed> any one know how long hes been on ?
[3:24:14] <+barretzm> Todd Coward vs. David "Fartballs" Cage
[3:24:19] <+moranprime> Look at that lol, my story boards look nothing like that.
[3:24:27] <%krawtch> they stuff androids in one side of the machine and tupperware pops out the other side
[3:24:28] <ExpendableComicRelief> D:
[3:24:28] <+JenovasPuppet> You people are all nuts, trying to read real world politics into this pure game
[3:24:30] <averagehero1> Leave jiren to me says David cage
[3:24:30] <gyrogogozeppeli> Who cares
[3:24:30] <SailingSaturn> @moranprime overall its super impressive, gotta give them that cirTan
[3:24:32] <Gruhunchously> I feel sorry for the other people at Quantic Dream.
[3:24:33] <%Plutt_bug> Alice cant die
[3:24:33] <%Keyd00d> nobody cares
[3:24:33] <$GohanEgret> it's an ending
[3:24:34] <GarbageQueenEllie> You can ABANDON HER
[3:24:34] <$Chichen> who cares
[3:24:35] <bsmusic> ...
[3:24:35] <OwlLightningMage> WHO GIVES A SHIT
[3:24:37] <+cvp5127> who cares
[3:24:38] <$Sphincter_Spelunker> disgusting french gremlin
[3:24:38] <AlasterAngelo> EVERYBODY CLAPS
[3:24:39] <Jhyk3> Can Alice even die for real?
[3:24:39] <nepwar> Kara shuts down
[3:24:39] <Ultimatefool> The game gets better
[3:24:39] <+moranprime> @SailingSaturn Indeed.
[3:24:41] <Hydrapissed> who cares
[3:24:41] <+FrostMass22> Everyone is glad when she's dead
[3:24:42] <doofmaster> Kara can abandon alice in a couple spots
[3:24:42] <$serpenttucker> Can she even die?
[3:24:43] <Intolerable> FUCK THAT TINY TOASTER
[3:24:43] <%HorseChange> we laugh
[3:24:43] <OwlLightningMage> ALICE IS JUST A TOASTER
[3:24:44] <+skizzuto> i don't think alice can die here
[3:24:45] <%Logan_Jennings1> Man fuck Kara's story so much
[3:24:47] <RollCritFail> "It is not about Ze Racism" *Cage Leans In Closer and Whispers* "But it iz tho, teehee" Kappa
[3:24:47] <DatAsuna> Abandoning Alice ends the story
[3:24:47] <snake_zen> I HOPE THEY DO THE BOAT RIDE
[3:24:48] <negativejam> ALICE IS A PLASTIC TOASTER NotLikeThis
[3:24:49] <lightsinx98> you can leave kara in the concentration camp
[3:24:49] <%krawtch> Kara's story literally does not matter in this game whatsoever
[3:24:49] <Hadley> Why does it matter she's a toaster child
[3:24:49] <+barretzm> Who cares
[3:24:51] <missingangle> If Alice dies, everyone throws a party
[3:24:53] <Endocrom> Luther go BOOM
[3:24:54] <lightsinx98> Its AMAZING
[3:24:55] <%happyface699> @negativejam I hit my toaster the other day I’m evil as fuck
[3:24:58] <MrDonTacos_> clintFug clintS Luther
[3:24:58] <DatAsuna> There is no story after leaving alice
[3:25:01] <averagehero1> Kara is her own story after talking to Marcus like it honestly doesn't matter
[3:25:01] <gyrogogozeppeli> only peopel who care about Alice are easily swayed idiots
[3:25:02] <%krawtch> Kara dying at Todds house changes nothing
[3:25:05] <+YourPalFrost> yourpa1Ah
[3:25:06] <bsmusic> LUL
[3:25:07] <+badchoice5> Alice better make the BEST fucking toast after all this work
[3:25:07] <+JenovasPuppet> Surely Alice can die if you fail the concentration camp
[3:25:08] <alrobot2014> alice is a chinese myth dragon
[3:25:09] <DracaenaLeaf> Didn't luther die in the explosion
[3:25:10] <alexandrecau> fbi bad guy is replacement connor right? so for optimal story connor should be a machine
[3:25:12] <+FrostMass22> Alice dying is the most interesting thing she can do
[3:25:16] <Gruhunchously> I'm an easily swayed idiot...
[3:25:21] <G_Lancaster> If Alice dies in game YOU DIE in real life
[3:25:22] <nepwar> if alice dies, david cage comes on screen and yells EMOSHUNS at you
[3:25:23] <negativejam> @happyface699 I tried to make peace with my oven, they burnt my bread FeelsBadMan
[3:25:23] <OwlLightningMage> Innocent people murdered over toasters
[3:25:25] <%CapnCarnivore> where was the "throw child toaster overboard" prompt? @PeachSaliva
[3:25:26] <DatAsuna> @averagehero1 except she's not, if she leaves kara it just ends
[3:25:29] <GarbageQueenEllie> @JenovasPuppet You can fucking LEAVE her there and she gets owned
[3:25:30] <averagehero1> Kara will protect her NES mini at all cost
[3:25:31] <lightsinx98> you can ditch alice in the camp and leave her to die
[3:25:36] <lightsinx98> its the best
[3:25:39] <%krawtch> SWAT cops just doing their jobs, murdered by ruthless calculators
[3:25:39] <bsmusic> BEST BOY
[3:25:43] <+barretzm> If Alice dies you beat the Frenchman

[3:25:48] <Graxe_> Aw, now we don't get to see the camps.
[3:25:53] <HannibalBeerus> Kara is the Chip of this game because the whole fucking game doesnt change if she's in it or not
[3:25:53] <$Sphincter_Spelunker> I love that I just saw two comments in row calling them toasters LUL
[3:25:53] <%Logan_Jennings1> Conner is the only good part of this game.
[3:25:59] <ExpendableComicRelief> oh, hearing connor's name made me need to shit
[3:25:59] <bsmusic> 100%

[3:26:08] <lightsinx98> Paige should play Nier after this and this whole chat will cheer for androids
[3:26:10] <AlasterAngelo> This game should literally have only been a Connor game
[3:26:13] <Gruhunchously> This game is sorely missing a 'Sacrifice Alice' prompt at the end.
[3:26:14] <%krawtch> Alice is the PS1 classic of this game

[3:26:33] <AlasterAngelo> Machine Connor is a cold motherfucker
[3:26:33] <Master_Lance_> @PeachSaliva have you guys died as connor at all yet?
[3:26:34] <Dr_mr_wang> nier is so good

[3:26:35] <Graxe_> Connor get s a free ride.
[3:26:37] <averagehero1> machine connor is a literal terminator
[3:26:37] <Firesparks> conor vs hank is actually one of the best scene in the game
[3:26:41] <CastellanVon> You can straight up abandon Alice in the Concentration Camp ending. It's fucking hilarious
[3:26:44] <+smargh1015> this game is more missing having alice being an actual human
[3:26:45] <%Keyd00d> You're on friend stats
[3:26:46] <lightsinx98> Connor and Hank should have been the whole game

[3:26:55] <+pleasenameyourcharacter> I feel more sympathy for faceless soldiers designed to be emotionless and unsympathetic than the inherintly flawed, hypocritical "protagonist" that is Markus. Complete failure of a game.
[3:26:58] <Kalcom> friend stat
[3:26:59] <$Kravedarknesss> remember how kara was gonna have an interesting connection to the plot but then David decided to just regulate her to a caretaker
[3:27:02] <+badchoice5> How delicious would the toast have to be to justify giving your toaster a chance of going deviant?

[4:20:37] <+Nomicro4u> TELL HER YOUR FAILURE PAT
[4:20:37] <Jontman42> Yeah but the other one wouldn't have been all sentimental like that
[4:20:37] <CastellanVon> It's the delivery
[4:20:37] <HyperBomb21> The difference is that the real conner has aemotion behind it
[4:20:38] <Ropcord> yeah but connor was all sad about it
[4:20:39] <SailingSaturn> LUL
[4:20:39] <%Spydurman> But the point is Connor shows empathy
[4:20:39] <SkullyIsDie> YEP
[4:20:39] <Aussie_Manny> Meh.
[4:20:41] <time_axis> He knew Cole's name, but it was more about Connor's monologue there.

[4:20:41] <LiquidMathew> IT WAS BECAUSE CONNOR HAD EMOTION AND WAS SORRY COLE DIED

[4:20:49] <lethallylactic> Yeah, but Fake Connor wouldn't have been able to give that kind of answer.
[4:20:50] <Virokwet> but that andrid had no empathy
[4:20:50] <mr_slaide> CANADA
[4:20:50] <Neo_Kaiser> Just ask what happened at the police station.
[4:20:51] <+Camail> i think it was the empathy in his voice
[4:20:51] <DatAsuna> This si the worst of the 3 kara endings
[4:20:51] <+KaizenChaos> But he was too needy

[4:20:53] <Endocrom> Now all those androids have to take the one elevator up.

[4:20:55] <+Hilleltaco> Asking two androids questions is actually meaningless and useless
[4:20:55] <buffmurffy> it wasn't the name, it was connor showing sympathy
[4:20:55] <$Piemono> He wouldn't have cared enough about Hank to figure out his hangups from his son's death
[4:20:55] <+aversal_ammar> There's like another hour left.

[4:20:59] <%Admiral_PopnFresh> Umm...Yeah, freeing the androids is morally the right thing to do...but to think enormous social unrest wouldn't occur, and more surgeons will be on Red Ice, killing more kids in the future
[4:21:00] <+comb711> I think it's the sniveling the other connor has to do that gets him shot

[4:21:39] <Gruhunchously> There was definitely better ways to do that scene. Like have the other Connor clinically state the facts of Cole's death, and the real Connor empathizing with Hank's pain.

[4:21:51] <%GeneralSCPatton> cheer200 The real Connor's answer was uniquely human and went into the psychology of Hank's grief.

[4:42:30] <%juxtest> SHOW HER THE COWARD KARA END
[4:42:31] <+JenovasPuppet> "Best" is a descriptor of how the characters feel about it, not of the writing.

[4:42:36] <Endocrom> Hank is at the bar
[4:42:37] <Them00n> Paige is in a perpetual state of confusion.
[4:42:37] <%legendfather_of_giants> @PeachSaliva NUKE is best ending
[4:42:37] <%Admiral_PopnFresh> Even the good endings seem unfulfilling, eh Paige?
[4:42:37] <+TONYOO101> They forgot about him in this ending

[4:42:39] <$Sphincter_Spelunker> Apologize for yelling, Pat. Baka

[4:42:43] <The_Esquana> yes, let me look at this orange thing that blends into the background of the scene rather than the BLUE THING THAT STANDS OUT

[4:42:44] <%HorseChange> There is Pat
[4:42:45] <averagehero1> Hank went to Florida saying bye Conner BITCH

[4:42:57] <OwlLightningMage> NUKE AND EVIL CONNOR ARE THE BEST ENDINGS
[4:42:57] <+barretzm> After credits
[4:42:57] <%superc37> @peachsaliva So what happens like 5 years later when their neighbors inevitablely look at alice and go, "wait how is she still 8? and why do yall never eat?"
[4:42:59] <+AXL808> PeachSaliva! Blunders her way into the fray!
[4:43:00] <Hydrapissed> OMEGA BLIND!

[4:43:06] <%HorseChange> Again
[4:43:07] <Luesagna00> @peachsaliva it was seriously aggravating her not seeing the blue stone at the end
[4:43:07] <bsmusic> ....
[4:43:12] <%kinggooglyeyes> paige is secretly a moth pat we know this
[4:43:12] <itsangelll> Lol
[4:43:14] <Endocrom> "Magic rock"
[4:43:14] <+tigerfang86> SAME PAT
[4:43:14] <$Piemono> @PeachSaliva The worst part about the endings to this game is that CyberLife's Evil plan/the cause of deviancy changes based off your decisions
[4:43:16] <+tigerfang86> SAAAAAAAAAAAME
[4:43:17] <%Plutt_bug> HOW DID YOU REMEMBER COLE?!!?
[4:43:17] <Dragon_Batman> of course it's not gonna say it
[4:43:19] <+barretzm> Kill everyone
[4:43:20] <AstroFalcon09> yeah paige Kappa
[4:43:20] <+LumberjackJack> To be fair, it would have been better if the stone was brighter
[4:43:21] <suikudo> Paige is just Pats proxy at this point

[4:43:25] <alrobot2014> YOU YOURSELF SAID THE MAGIC ROCK
[4:43:25] <Salty3acon> 222222
[4:43:26] <$Sphincter_Spelunker> IT'S ALWAYS THE WORST ITS EVER BEEN
[4:43:26] <Worldbrand> it was mostly that she glued her camera to the ground for some reason
[4:43:27] <Tampaoster> that's what's worth
[4:43:27] <+aversal_ammar> BLIND LP

[5:21:58] <booglesnurf> Every room in their house has a bus on top of it just in case
[5:22:02] <SeventyForce> Just watch the ra9 end on youtubr :D
[5:22:02] <Kaitepaints> @neo_kaiser agreed
[5:22:04] <Luesagna00> @peachsaliva alice plot was similar of origami killer revesl
[5:22:05] <AlasterAngelo> hank and connor were improvised
[5:22:06] <%happyface699> @moranprime That’s right jay

[5:22:25] <%happyface699> See what I did there
[5:22:26] <%AncelDeLambert> "I love my daddy!"
[5:22:27] <Bouldus> they only had 1 child
[5:22:29] <+LumberjackJack> It's not Alice
[5:22:31] <+moranprime> Because laziness.
[5:22:32] <%shen4u> They couldn't afford another model
[5:22:33] <Shiranui24> same actor?
[5:22:36] <changtasia> ASSETS ARE EXPENSIVE
[5:22:38] <Bouldus> could find another 1
[5:22:41] <Bouldus> couldnt
[5:22:42] <%happyface699> No shutup

[5:22:56] <TalisKanju> David Cage, you are a HACK!
[5:22:57] <%SuichiTanaka> Fucking Red Dead
[5:22:59] <%QueequegTheater> "I know writers who use subtext, and they're all cowards."
[5:22:59] <+JenovasPuppet> EWW
[5:23:05] <AlasterAngelo> David Cage is inspirational. If he can be a successful writer anybody can
[5:23:07] <DracaenaLeaf> REcency sucks ass
[5:23:11] <frozenwaifu> HE DID GOOD
[5:23:17] <neonlightzzz> Brian carried that game on his back BOTH WAYS IN THE SNOW BAREFOOT
[5:23:19] <$rdark_ksu> Man Arthur Morgan did a god job being a Potato guy
[5:23:22] <Endocrom> Brian Dechart, Chris Judge and... Read Dead guy
[5:23:31] <NavigatorBR> @AlasterAngelo So true, thank you for that...
[5:23:33] <+Hilleltaco> Everything AROUND David is great
[5:23:37] <+moranprime> That scene where Connor fights the giant bugs in an office building was tight.
[5:23:37] <nepwar> Cage will upload himself so he will be quantic dreams
[5:23:38] <%AncelDeLambert> Kara's entire plot needs a rewrite from the ground up
[5:23:43] <DXLelouch24> dont worry Paige your emotional breakdown is already posted to the subreddit
[5:23:44] <+badchoice5> This game has the most realized potential of any Cage, and thats a shame
[5:23:49] <%TheMilhouseExperience> Extend that to the rest of the game. Very nice job. Also REVIVE YANG!
[5:23:53] <changtasia> Written and Directed by David Paige
[5:24:00] <black_mages_matter_> The mechanics and splitting story is impressive and cool, it's just all the stories you can see in this game are TOTAL TRASH GARBAGE
[5:24:05] <%QueequegTheater> Yang Xiao Long > All other Yangs
[5:24:07] <Angry_Ev1L> nobody knows
[5:24:14] <mercado94> who?
[5:24:17] <b1gboss007> arrhur morhan deserved to win, stop being hipsters and hating rdr2 because is popular
[5:24:18] <MementoExtasis> :) IceCold
[5:24:20] <%happyface699> @black_mages_matter_ Except Connor chan
[5:24:21] <nepwar> with the power of lupus, all is possible
[5:24:21] <DXLelouch24> Yang was alive the whole time Milhouse
[5:24:22] <+JenovasPuppet> lol
[5:24:26] <DXLelouch24> she checked
[5:24:29] <+badchoice5> Paige's melting mental state accidentally triggered ULTRA INSTINCT
[5:24:38] <booglesnurf> Yang Yong Wong
[5:24:41] <AlasterAngelo> "Well Dutch, if another man wants to sleep with my wife well who am I to stop him?"
[5:24:45] <+JenovasPuppet> Was this before or after you ATE ELMO'S HAIR?
[5:24:46] <Alpha820> Christopher Judge was in Stargate SG1 as Tealq. Have I outed myself as a huge nerd? Indeed.
[5:24:47] <%TheMilhouseExperience> That's the joke.
[5:24:53] <$Tredecian> ra9 is unexplained
[5:24:54] <Salty3acon> oh no
[5:24:57] <Luesagna00> wow less than 700 viewers now xD
[5:24:58] <%ssjklyco> New hard drive is required for paige
[5:25:08] <%QueequegTheater> @PeachSaliva Alright, I'm heading to sleep
[5:25:09] <%GeneralSCPatton> @alpha820 Indeed
[5:25:12] <+JenovasPuppet> The latter
[5:25:12] <OwlLightningMage> GO TO FUCKING BED BEFORE PAIGE DIES
[5:25:12] <%legendfather_of_giants> @Alpha820 nope, because you mispelled Teal'c
[5:25:18] <%AncelDeLambert> Alice makes NO FUCKING SENSE
[5:25:19] <DatAsuna> Stunted
[5:25:21] <+Nomicro4u> I don't like that childbots exist in a universe where sexbots are common place
[5:25:25] <nepwar> Is alice ever confirmed as a deviant?
[5:25:25] <+Gruntini> HAH
[5:25:27] <b1gboss007> @tredecian doesn't the game disk say ra9 implying that you are Ra9?
[5:25:29] <DonatelloJose> I believe she has lower processing power compared to normal adults.
[5:25:29] <booglesnurf> Marcus still has that button
[5:25:29] <+JenovasPuppet> Yep, Alice will never grow physically or mentally. She is forever a child.

[5:25:42] <black_mages_matter_> @happyface699 even some of that bothers me, like how you cant refuse to shoot the android for hank. it has to be for yourself. and they dont acknowledge that hank is replacing his dead son with a bipedal toaster. it's just the actors carrying it there. best line in the game is "I like dogs"
[5:25:43] <ingobernable34> NANI THE FUCK!?

[5:26:10] <LiquidMathew> Detroit President is Hilary Trump
[5:26:11] <Dragon_Batman> That's super weird
[5:26:13] <emillionghost> theres too many sound clips

[5:26:14] <averagehero1> Can we get President Paige then???
[5:26:15] <+JenovasPuppet> Paige could be president

[5:26:26] <%legendfather_of_giants> @PeachSaliva with the tickets
[5:26:27] <%happyface699> @black_mages_matter_ Yeah I cared about Connor and hank because of the actors but not the actual characters motivations

[5:27:07] <$Dutchpotato> yeah it was super imperssive
[5:27:11] <%happyface699> @dxlelouch24 He would just say tank controls and re2 is gospel
[5:27:14] <Kaitepaints> @dxlelouch24 I think about 2/3 of the human population could do better than trump
[5:27:22] <neonlightzzz> @frozenwaifu our country would be better for it
[5:27:24] <Shiranui24> it sounds really bad
[5:27:26] <+skizzuto> to be fair, she had pat's help a bit with stuff like finding cole's name

[5:28:22] <black_mages_matter_> @PeachSaliva Connor's story is about an old man whose son died and was gifted a Tamagotchi to replace him
[5:28:22] <+Nomicro4u> Real Paige would panic and get the answer wrong, that is how you would know
[5:28:24] <%TheMilhouseExperience> Evil paige would know the answer.
[5:28:28] <SeventyForce> Watch Connor's suicide ending
[5:28:29] <MrDonTacos_> EVIL PAIGE HATES MUSTARD
[5:28:29] <MSN04_Sazabi> Also look up the CyberLife ending it makes the game even worse by adding YET another twist
[5:28:29] <changtasia> doesn't matter, the real one would just go "wait, what was the question?"
