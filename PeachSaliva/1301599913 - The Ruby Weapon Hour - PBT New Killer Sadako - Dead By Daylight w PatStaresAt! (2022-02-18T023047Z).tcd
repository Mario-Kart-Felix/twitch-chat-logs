Very tight story, a likeable party and a killer final boss track. People should talk about it more often. It's your favorite isn't it? Would love to see you stream more FF.

[0:55:32] <%Ranryu692> it was THIS week, Pat
[0:55:32] <%barrakuta371> @SoFarFetched omg NotLikeThis
[0:55:33] <%Brassnarwhal> pat out here respecting women
[0:55:33] <Zeif00> This killer is going to be awful for Paige in particular
[0:55:38] <%Ranryu692> it was Monday lol
[0:55:39] <%arcaderabbit48> Sure showed him, I guess
[0:55:43] <+CalderGaming> you heard it from her chat: never make the mistake of respecting paige
[0:55:47] <%Dakuu75> Paige's Vtuber was at doodFps before Pat's cam
[0:55:50] <%Sotetsu> Good luck getting scared
[0:55:54] <arkv01> oh its on
[0:55:59] <+BiggusWingless> Oooooh
[0:56:00] <%arcaderabbit48> What's Sadako's deal?
[0:56:00] <Rafikator> he's right
[0:56:05] <$shurtal> Pat's a loser?
[0:56:10] <BigFingerRo> Oh cool,problems have been solve
[0:56:18] <%KingKrampus> pat you think Chrono Cross sucks and that the Tolkien anime is going to suck though
[0:56:30] <%Sotetsu> Oh good, we can see Paige's cat blinking.
[0:56:38] <+BiggusWingless> Chrono Cross is the Ben Shapiro's Sister of video games
[0:56:39] <+Felhad> Holding tape makes you build up the bad juice
[0:56:39] <@SoFarFetched> shes coming in her shitballs
[0:56:45] <%arcaderabbit48> She is smol
[0:56:52] <$shurtal> Sadako was fone!
[0:56:52] <%Brassnarwhal> you guys excited about getting the crunchyroll app on the switch? i love watching my anime in lower quality on a less mobile device than just using my phone
[0:56:55] <Rafikator> Sadako was our old partner ya know
[0:56:57] <%Sotetsu> @sofarfetched Thank you for spelling that that way.
[0:56:59] <%KingKrampus> @bigguswingless how dare you slander Chrono Cross like that
[0:57:13] <Mahrota> She really is shorter than the survivors, cute
[0:57:13] <@SoFarFetched> geefSmugAF
[0:57:19] <+CalderGaming> paige if you get grabbed you can yell "help! Leon!" and then Pat will DEFINITELY want to help you more
[0:57:22] <@SoFarFetched> shes also shorter than hag
[0:57:33] <+Felhad> she the smol
[0:57:34] <@SoFarFetched> She is the shortest behind hag.
[0:57:35] <Ner234> @Brassnarwhal My phone is shit so it'll be an upgrade. LUL
[0:57:39] <@SoFarFetched> No hags slightly taller.
[0:57:39] <%arcaderabbit48> She looks Survivor sized
[0:57:41] <+rrratbastard> she's the only one classified AS Short in the game. everyone else is medium or tall
[0:57:41] <%Brassnarwhal> that rando was throwing lol
[0:57:43] <%Sotetsu> She is the shortest, and she is the first to be called short.
[0:57:48] <Rafikator> TV you can play smash on that !
[0:57:56] <zzNamttamzz> Viktor is shorter
[0:58:02] <+Soliloquy123> I thought Freddy was Short as well
[0:58:10] <lemon_lover28> what is her tape gimmick?
[0:58:18] <+rrratbastard> nah, i double checked. freddy's medium too
[0:58:25] <%maskofmichael> I thinks she's kind of hot
[0:58:29] <+Fuggins4U> Pat and I saw her in Japan, she's not scary
[0:58:31] <%Sotetsu> Pat is only afraid of tall people
[0:58:51] <@SoFarFetched> Tape gimmick is you can grab a video tape,which turns off the TV for a lil while so she can't teleport,then you bring it to the farthest TV to remove some condemn off.
[0:58:59] <@SoFarFetched> Yeah even when you're fully condemned you can just remove it still.
[0:59:00] <+BiggusWingless> Hillbillussy
[0:59:03] <+Soliloquy123> Condemned is more for slowing people down than for getting kills
[0:59:11] <+Soliloquy123> It's a side objective they have to worry about
[0:59:13] <@SoFarFetched> Its not like once you're condemned you can't undo it.
[0:59:14] <Gehtingsberg> we can too
[0:59:14] <Rafikator> Pat is only scared if he needs to use consumables
[0:59:16] <%Sotetsu> Survivors need to get one permanent condemned blip per time they are hooked.
[0:59:19] <+CalderGaming> psaDogchamp psaGiefrail psaGiefstare
[0:59:31] <lemon_lover28> @SoFarFetched ty
[0:59:38] <$shurtal> he gums stuff
[0:59:38] <+Taisuru> Let him play with things
[0:59:39] <HaroldDonchee> sounds like a mechanic that would really mess with new people
[0:59:40] <%Brassnarwhal> psaGiefrail psaMenace
[1:00:01] <%arcaderabbit48> I just looked up what Sadako does and I still dont get it
[1:00:02] <+Taisuru> Gief for next Killer in dbd
[1:00:07] <Ell1ot> hide like a brave coward
[1:00:14] <+Felhad> @taisuru Too OP
[1:00:26] <@SoFarFetched> The other thing is you only get condemn built if you're near a TV when she teleports
[1:00:36] <@SoFarFetched> Which if she's not teleporting a lot you're not building a lot of condemn.
[1:00:41] <Rafikator> Killer mains are bad luck ?
[1:00:49] <Rafikator> SAD killer main noises
[1:00:55] <@SoFarFetched> Other way of course is holding onto the tape for a long period of time,but  you can just return it near the end and have most of it removed geefShrug
[1:00:57] <+Felhad> also builds slowly while holding the tape @sofarfetched
[1:01:05] <+Felhad> oh you know
[1:01:08] <@SoFarFetched> Yeah I just said it LUL above your response.
[1:01:16] <@SoFarFetched> Its just a lot of typing.
[1:01:20] <+Felhad> lol
[1:01:32] <+Felhad> it builds super slowly though
[1:01:38] <+Milo_san> sadako is hot
[1:01:40] <%jinking79> like freddy
[1:01:45] <+Felhad> they need to crank it up a bit
[1:02:03] <+rrratbastard> when's jhorror revival in the west? i want one missed call 2
[1:02:11] <@SoFarFetched> But even at fully condemn,you still need to hit them twice as they aren't with the exposed effect.
[1:02:39] <%Sotetsu> I like weak killers.
[1:02:41] <@SoFarFetched> and even when shes chasing you fully condemned,you can during the chase return a tape to remove some meter.
[1:02:42] <Ravioli_Ronin> Teleportussy
[1:02:43] <mr_saturday93> she has no way to enforce ppl to run to the
[1:02:49] <%MightyDuckShoes> This is the worst Pokedex voice.
[1:02:58] <Gehtingsberg> chat PLEASE
[1:02:59] <Rafikator> @rrratbastard  god please no  I'd like to see pulse again tho
[1:02:59] <%RayReborne> Cursed
[1:03:03] <PartyFavors> I think she's cool, but she definitely needs buffs
[1:03:03] <Samuel412> Imagine a horror movie where somebody actually broke down the ghost threat that harshly
[1:03:09] <%maskofmichael> Ringussy
[1:03:10] <+TopTieramisu> smallpoxussy
[1:03:12] <@ckbooks> She's basically like Myers. Big spooky but no anti-loop to deal with experienced survivors.
[1:03:15] <%Sotetsu> Err, I mean I like playing as weak killers.
[1:03:17] <+BiggusWingless> Do you know what it means to Sadako a Hoe?
[1:03:20] <+Felhad> Sadokussy
[1:03:25] <+Taisuru> VCRussy
[1:03:35] <%RayReborne> VCRUSSY OH GOD
[1:03:37] <@SoFarFetched> I have yet to play her in the PTB because I heard the wait was really long.
[1:03:41] <@SoFarFetched> so I just did a lot of survivor games against her.
[1:03:51] <lemon_lover28> I don't play this game but the meta seems like it would take a while to learn
[1:03:59] <+TopTieramisu> GG
[1:04:07] <BigFingerRo> Hey peach, have we not have NERRDALEEEERRRTs yet?
[1:04:07] <@SoFarFetched> Otz put her at C tier.
[1:04:10] <+godzookylives> YOU DID IT
[1:04:12] <+BiggusWingless> There is no such thing as a bad part of a pig
[1:04:13] <+rbakervv> she needs another way to build condemened, like while chasing suvivors or something
[1:04:17] <+rrratbastard> hopefully she gets some good changes for release. they also mentioned overhauling ghostface and legion too
[1:04:25] <+Felhad> Spooky doesnt equal dangerous though
[1:04:25] <%maskofmichael> I find her sexy
[1:04:29] <HaroldDonchee> did she down anyone?
[1:04:30] <%Sotetsu> 4 condemned blips or more should make you exposed.
[1:04:31] <%arcaderabbit48> She seems to have an incredibly specific gimmick that's ahrd to trigger and all it does is give her an Instant Kill. So at that point just play Pig or Pyramid Head
[1:04:32] <+BiggusWingless> Remember when Freddy was useless for like a year
[1:04:33] <+Taisuru> Spirit is a better Sadako
[1:04:43] <Rafikator> dUDE i'd love to see something new for ghostie face
[1:04:46] <%MightyDuckShoes> @Samuel412 Yeah, I wish for a real Ghostbusters movie. "See, there's yer problem. Ya got a Class 5 Poltergeist in your Oven."
[1:04:49] <Zeif00> I just ignored the tapes, and I escaped every match
[1:04:56] <$SinisterBroccoli> whos the guy in the bottom right?
[1:05:04] <$SinisterBroccoli> looks like a liam neeson
[1:05:07] <@SoFarFetched> @SinisterBroccoli Felix from The Blight Chapter
[1:05:13] <+CalderGaming> waynerWhiteP waynerWhite
[1:05:18] <%rumtumtugnutz> *farts with emphasis*
[1:05:33] <Gehtingsberg> @rumtumtugnutz lmao wut
[1:05:33] <%arcaderabbit48> Of Ghostbusters got a DBD killer, who would it be?
[1:05:37] <Meekest> rooWaddle eabWADDLE rooWaddle eabWADDLE
[1:05:41] <%DiasFox> DiasFox subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 2 months, currently on a 1 month streak! 
[1:05:49] <RetroCop87> ff9 best tho
[1:05:50] <@SoFarFetched> would probably make sense if Gozer or Vigo was the killer.
[1:06:04] <%rumtumtugnutz> it'd have to be Gozer
[1:06:05] <+Felhad> 6 is best
[1:06:13] <%Gouf_Troop> 9 is perfect imo but thats fair
[1:06:27] <%MisterRockett> IV is really good and somehow under 20 hours.
[1:06:27] <scrumbotime> of course
[1:06:28] <%Ranryu692> make it a giant Stay Puft marshmallow man, cowards
[1:06:29] <%arcaderabbit48> @PeachSaliva How is Yang's corpse doing by the way?
[1:06:29] <%rumtumtugnutz> teetaws
[1:06:29] <+goose_attack_almanac> tifa
[1:06:35] <SGrim> Correct
[1:06:36] <sydowoodo> hell yeah!!!
[1:06:40] <%NoHoldsBarredProductions> Tifa is life
[1:06:42] <scrumbotime> tifa can punch me
[1:06:53] <+Felhad> Tifa for sure no contest, and Sae is really strong
[1:06:58] <%MisterRockett> Yang lives either way lol.
[1:07:02] <%rumtumtugnutz> teetaw Lockhart is best girl
[1:07:04] <%arcaderabbit48> I dont believe you
[1:07:07] <@MelBrooksKA> Sai is alright but she's no contest with Tifa
[1:07:17] <%arcaderabbit48> Tifa's yeehaws
[1:07:38] <+Felhad> Viva Italia!
[1:07:39] <%MightyDuckShoes> @arcaderabbit48  I want Slimer. It would just be Slimer and his "kills" would be gags. But they'd likely just make it the Evil ghost lady Zuul? and Terror dog summons.
[1:07:51] <linSP> Ff6 is better than FF4 even though I like 4 better.
[1:07:52] <RetroCop87> I still haven't played it. Pixelremaster is going to be my virgin run
[1:08:02] <+Taisuru> That whomps
[1:08:05] <%RayReborne> yeah its nuts
[1:08:08] <%jinking79> Dancing Mad so good
[1:08:12] <%arcaderabbit48> @MightyDuckShoes Honestly giving DBD a joke killer would be kinda great. Just the one, but make it a really good one
[1:08:23] <%MisterRockett> I'm playing V clean now and can't wait till pixel remaster for VI comes out.
[1:08:25] <%rumtumtugnutz> ffvi is a fucking masterpiece
[1:08:32] <+CalderGaming> ANOTHER KNIFE?!
[1:08:35] <@MelBrooksKA> Has Woolie not played it?
[1:08:35] <morningmoondude> KNIFEGIEF
[1:08:36] <linSP> I can’t wait for woolie’s playthrough
[1:08:37] <%NoHoldsBarredProductions> @patstaresat Any interest at all in revisiting it as the big boy gamer you are today?
[1:08:38] <%rumtumtugnutz> and I bet Woolie will hate it
[1:08:40] <%RayReborne> i hope the pixel remaster is good cuz the ps1 version is SLOW AS BALLS
[1:08:41] <+Rofiarf> oh no zangief is stabbing pat!
[1:08:46] <+Taisuru> Gief is powerful
[1:08:50] <%Ranryu692> I still need to play Final Fantasies 4, 5, 6, 7, and 9
[1:08:53] <lemon_lover28> why start right before Elden Ring?
[1:08:55] <%RayReborne> couldnt play it cuz it was so slow on ps1
[1:08:57] <+Felhad> They need to stop giving him knives
[1:09:09] <RetroCop87> I bet Woolie will take 20 minutes to beat the Snail boss
[1:09:14] <%MightyDuckShoes> @arcaderabbit48  Yeah, I dont know if DBD already had one like that. But if it's novel they can have the one. As a treat.
[1:09:25] <%rumtumtugnutz> why is it always the dumb shit I say that gets called out, jeez,
[1:09:25] <+Taisuru> I also think he will like it because Sabin
[1:09:28] <%Brassnarwhal> Elden ring better watch out, the majoras mask switch port is coming out on the 25th as well, could be a tough competition
[1:09:28] <+Fuggins4U> no
[1:09:31] <+Fuggins4U> no PAt
[1:09:32] <+Rofiarf> no
[1:09:32] <@MelBrooksKA> Talk shit, get hit
[1:09:34] <+Felhad> no
[1:09:34] <mr_saturday93> no
[1:09:36] <+Fuggins4U> i thought he was a ninja
[1:09:36] <%Sotetsu> No
[1:09:36] <RetroCop87> no
[1:09:37] <Zeif00> no
[1:09:37] <PartyFavors> No

[1:09:46] <%zamatermort> No
[1:09:48] <+Fuggins4U> like
[1:09:48] <%MightyDuckShoes> Isn't shadow a ninja?
[1:09:48] <%RayReborne> lol
[1:09:48] <linSP> SHADOW IS A NINJA
[1:09:49] <+Felhad> Hes just in ninja garb
[1:09:55] <+Fuggins4U> wouldn't he be naked then?
[1:09:56] <RetroCop87> you know Square didn't believe in black people until Barret
[1:09:56] <%arcaderabbit48> He's a fucking ninja
[1:10:05] <%MightyDuckShoes> Did you think he was Blade, Pat?!
[1:10:08] <+Fuggins4U> oh Shadow's dream are super neat, i never saw all of them tho
[1:10:11] <artoflec> i definitely missed Shadow on the floating island though fuck
[1:10:12] <mr_saturday93> dreams of Jesus Christ? no Paige are ya a prophet!?
[1:10:13] <%RayReborne> hes just Ryu Hyabusa from NINJA GAYDEN Kappa
[1:10:18] <%arcaderabbit48> Wait. WAIT. Did that lady just slap you with kanji??
[1:10:22] <%Brassnarwhal> easy mistake for pat to make his local politicians wear blackface when they go to the schools for publicity
[1:10:25] <@SoFarFetched> yeah it says "noroir" curse
[1:10:25] <BigFingerRo> ahhhh yesssss the part of the stream I come here for, the OH JESUS SHIT ON MY TITTIES
[1:10:26] <Rafikator> " Nyeeeeh "
[1:10:31] <@SoFarFetched> noroi*
[1:10:32] <$chance_h> Kanji is pretty scary
[1:10:37] <Samuel412> Those knocked over boxes block the fucking ghost?
[1:10:37] <Ell1ot> i think she punched you with a stamp
[1:10:48] <Rafikator> You're toxic na na na na !:
[1:10:51] <BigFingerRo> let her rub your butt
[1:10:57] <%Brassnarwhal> @samuel412 when she manifests physically? yes
[1:10:59] <%arcaderabbit48> That's hilarious. I take it back, Sadako is the joke killer
[1:11:25] <%MightyDuckShoes> Yeah, The Ring would have been much scarier if the main character had to spend half the movie  restarting  generators. Kappa
[1:11:29] <artoflec> Paige do you have any like big SNES era games that everyone has played that you just missed
[1:11:35] <%rumtumtugnutz> your mom is a ninja
[1:11:38] <BigFingerRo> AHHHH GET REKT PLAGUE
[1:11:43] <+Fuggins4U> Tiddies
[1:12:11] <Ell1ot> that looks weird
[1:12:12] <BigFingerRo> this looks so silly
[1:12:15] <+Fuggins4U> this foxgirl swears like 3 sailors and my grandma
[1:12:28] <$Trenr> I mean, you were nailing those checks, looked pretty good to me
[1:12:30] <+allups> i like tht way more then the old one
[1:12:31] <+godzookylives> that looked kind of wacky
[1:12:34] <%greasypete00> sadako looks so goofy when she walks
[1:12:38] <%arcaderabbit48> The more of this I'm seeing, the more I'm thinking that Sadako may have been a mismatch for DBD
[1:12:42] <%jinking79> as if shaking the controller or mashing wasn't hard enough
[1:12:45] <DancesWitBalrog> Is that Sadako??
[1:12:46] <tank7013> So nice of you to get downed on purpose so we could see those animations Paige
[1:12:51] <+Fuggins4U> i wonder if that DBZ DBD game will be good
[1:12:57] <%Gouf_Troop> is pat mute
[1:13:01] <$Trenr> nice tunnel
[1:13:04] <GhoulishCripple> bold Strategy Cotton
[1:13:10] <+rrratbastard> the texas chainsaw one is really interesting to me. it's 3v4 apparently
[1:13:13] <VritraReiRei> damn, she's REALLY nice done in a lot of parts, but some of her animations just look jarring because Sadako is not really a fast pursuit kind of ghost
[1:13:15] <eustine> Does holding the tape make your counter go up?
[1:13:17] <+Felhad> If he talks then the killer can hear him
[1:13:32] <%toolofparanoia> the tv is the new demigorgon butthole tunnel
[1:13:33] <VritraReiRei> the way she slides around is more funny than scary LUL
[1:13:38] <+Fuggins4U> you still havin protein issues?
[1:13:44] <+Felhad> Is it time to order McDonald's?
[1:13:47] <@SoFarFetched> @eustine it does but VERY slowly,returning the tape to another TV removes a good amount of meter
[1:13:48] <%DoomUnderTheStairs> chikon is soooo good it's my favorite
[1:13:49] <+CalderGaming> dnoCOOKED
[1:13:57] <Ell1ot> i would like to see her drag people instead of the silly floating thing
[1:13:58] <eustine> @SoFarFetched ty
[1:13:59] <artoflec> howd u prepar chickgun artofl1Hm
[1:13:59] <%maskofmichael> Chicken and eggs are good together
[1:14:01] <mr_saturday93> fuck tunnlers
[1:14:03] <%MightyDuckShoes> I think it's an issue that this game has this framing with the claw monsters. It doesn't really fit some of these monsters. Sadako in a Texas Chainsaw map is weird
[1:14:11] <BigFingerRo> peach, do you eat like lil bits of stuff left on the counter or something? how come you're always running on fumes food-wise?
[1:14:17] <+CalderGaming> what a horrible night to have one
[1:14:21] <@SoFarFetched> you can just go to a TV and remove it geefO
[1:14:32] <DancesWitBalrog> 7 DAYS
[1:14:42] <%MightyDuckShoes> YAY
[1:14:42] <@SoFarFetched> Yup almost ALL removed.
[1:14:47] <Samuel412> pretty neat visual effect actually
[1:14:52] <BigFingerRo> she forgor
[1:14:53] <PartyFavors> @MightyDuckShoes they were trying something different, but she DOES definitely work better on indoor maps aesthetically
[1:14:53] <+Taisuru> So stupid that you can do that so quickly lol
[1:14:56] <Samuel412> wait, was it that easy to remove even
[1:14:59] <$Trenr> removed 4/7 curse
[1:14:59] <%toolofparanoia> the way she moves is so creepy
[1:15:10] <%arcaderabbit48> Sadako also honestly doesn't do a whole lot in her point of origin beyond be creepy and contort her body. So putting her in anything with hard rules and specific animations is just going to look off. Her primary attack is to just smack with giant glowing kanji for christ sake
[1:15:11] <+Ragnakawaii> that's sad that it removes so much
[1:15:18] <+Felhad> shoulda let her get the Mori psaSkelmo
[1:15:24] <artoflec> god what a fucking night, my dude. For a curse I mean.
[1:15:27] <+goose_attack_almanac> I thought you were a fox
[1:15:28] <@SoFarFetched> Yeah its why people don't bother removing the curse because once they get around to it, it removes alot geefShrug
[1:15:43] <tigerfang86> Pat SACRIFICED TO THE GODS
[1:15:43] <@SoFarFetched> killer still has to hit you twice to down you.
[1:15:49] <$Puhff> Massivussy
[1:15:57] <%toolofparanoia> I feel like a horror fan failure because I've never seen the original Ringu
[1:16:14] <DancesWitBalrog> Wasnt there a Kayako vs Sayako movie? maybe I just dreamnt The Grudge and The Ring had a crossover movie like Freddie vs Jason
[1:16:22] <%arcaderabbit48> I want the next crossover character to be Mitochondrial Eve
[1:16:26] <+CalderGaming> @toolofparanoia don't gatekeep yourself, it's fine
[1:16:29] <PartyFavors> @DancesWitBalrog no, that happened. It was very bad.
[1:16:31] <VentWilsn> imagine watching horror movies that arent The Bye Bye Man
[1:16:32] <%maskofmichael> It's the cops, cheese it!
[1:16:34] <%arcaderabbit48> @DancesWitBalrog No, that happened
[1:16:38] <%toolofparanoia> @DancesWitBalrog it exists
[1:16:39] <@SoFarFetched> @DancesWitBalrog there was, It was Sadako versus the Ju-on girl and they both merged
[1:16:52] <BigFingerRo> @arcaderabbit48 I don't want her if I can't also have Aya Breakowski
[1:16:53] <+polothegreatest> Ah yes,  baseball sadako
[1:17:06] <Samuel412> @artoflec solid reference.
[1:17:24] <DancesWitBalrog> thankfully I cant remember the plot of that movie LUL
[1:17:28] <%arcaderabbit48> @BigFingerRo Fine. But OG Aya is too powerful, so you get 3rd Birthday Aya instead
[1:17:34] <+joeyduderman> I effing love when you are vtuber
[1:17:40] <mr_sups> Just be faster than her
[1:17:47] <BigFingerRo> @arcaderabbit48 OH THAT SUCKS SO BAD THO
[1:17:48] <+Felhad> If any zombie fans haven't seen it go watch Train to Busan
[1:17:50] <%toolofparanoia> @toolofparanoia :) thank you. Still need to watch it
[1:17:54] <VritraReiRei> @PeachSaliva any other killers you would like to be added in the future? i cant think of any more monsters that arent already in the game
[1:18:15] <@SoFarFetched> geefO
[1:18:17] <@SoFarFetched> got greedy
[1:18:20] <DancesWitBalrog> what the hell paige LUL
[1:18:20] <%JoshManVGH> HUBRIS
[1:18:24] <+Fuggins4U> is the predator in this game?
[1:18:26] <BigFingerRo> @VritraReiRei Is the girlfriend from Get Out in?
[1:18:35] <+Taisuru> Oh, they changed the struggle again huh?
[1:18:36] <%ShinSanitater> ShinSanitater subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 26 months! Paiges v-tuber looks just as focused as her actual face why is that so accurate lmao

[1:19:16] <%AncelDeLambert> at least it can't get any dumber than the writing in 1
[1:19:17] <luftraumm1> i really enjoyed zero dawn, although it was horribly optimized on pc
[1:19:18] <artoflec> lol
[1:19:18] <VritraReiRei> For once, i wont be able to watch it live because I want to play it FIRST NotLikeThis

[1:19:47] <+CalderGaming> LA sucks [lived in LA for 4 years]
[1:19:48] <@Jekado> LA is the worst
[1:19:50] <KahnWick> I can't get into Horizon, platted the first game and it was just SOOO boring.
[1:19:51] <mr_sups> SAME ACTUALLY
[1:19:51] <@Jekado> Strident can confirm
[1:19:53] <+invalid_robin> The city is bad but around LA is fine
[1:19:54] <Daxalog> The only reason people live in LA is for connections
[1:19:54] <%ShinSanitater> Pat, the when you were playing warhammer you were surprised that kislev didn't have their own minis. They are coming out with a new line for them when they reboot the old fantasy world.
[1:19:56] <DancesWitBalrog> THE AIR QUALITY ISNT GREAT
[1:19:59] <+KngJester> his bloodline is weak
[1:20:00] <%Dakuu75> NO ONE in chat is defending LA lol
[1:20:00] <+BiggusWingless> LA is the fungal infected armpit of the west coast
[1:20:02] <artoflec> some parts of montreal are beautiful from when i went that one time tho
[1:20:02] <Cozy90> Pat Hollywood is even worse
[1:20:02] <%toolofparanoia> California is fine, parts of it are fine, LA is a trash fire
[1:20:02] <%Sotetsu> That wasn't the air, that is just what america does to you
[1:20:03] <%barrakuta371> LA is not fine. Sure some of the restaurants are nice, but thats not indicative of the city
[1:20:06] <$Puhff> All of California is diseased
[1:20:06] <%Gouf_Troop> im from cleveland so...
[1:20:06] <+Ragnakawaii> I would rather go to Staten Island than LA
[1:20:10] <+kyh9> Paige, LA is not fine to live
[1:20:14] <@SoFarFetched> I'd rather go to Candy Apple Island.
[1:20:16] <RetroCop87> Pat, aren't you a Captain Planet villain?
[1:20:19] <%RayReborne> @kahnwick then why did you plat it? just a completionist thing?
[1:20:20] <+kyh9> LA was barely livable 30 years ago
[1:20:20] <%KngJester> KngJester subscribed at Tier 1. 
[1:20:22] <+kyh9> It's worse now
[1:20:25] <+kyh9> NYC is more tolerable
[1:20:27] <artoflec> isnt staten island where the new york dump and vinny are
[1:20:31] <%ShinSanitater> i love dank shit
[1:20:42] <@MelBrooksKA> Super NSFW
[1:20:42] <DancesWitBalrog> i rather rustle with NYC super rats than go to LA
[1:20:44] <Ell1ot> what's it called again?
[1:20:47] <+CalderGaming> CHIKMIN
[1:20:51] <%Ranryu692> @artoflec nah we ship it to New Jersey now

[1:21:14] <+CalderGaming> Fuggins Stormwind shouted a man to death?!
[1:21:15] <$kawajenarts> yeah CA has air pollution days where you get boarded inside the buildings to prevent over-inhalation
[1:21:18] <+the22cstomp> MURDER IS OKAY
[1:21:23] <%Brassnarwhal> and your FISTS
[1:21:23] <nmaten> its ok sometimes
[1:21:23] <%MarylandJutsu> I'm here for balls in asses
[1:21:25] <DancesWitBalrog> Fuggins, I support your near future murder
[1:21:26] <$Puhff> FUGGINS KILL
[1:21:26] <luftraumm1> ROMANTICIZE MURDeR
[1:21:27] <+GinAndRoses> fresh kills landfill is full, now they're trying to reclaim it!
[1:21:27] <+DrFacilier> what if murder the rich
[1:21:28] <%robotoken> murder is always good
[1:21:29] <%Brassnarwhal> DO IT FUGGINS
[1:21:30] <$kawajenarts> was brutal during school
[1:21:31] <scrumbotime> MURDER AND KILLING AND MURDER
[1:21:31] <+mac_6ixx> murder is okay now?
[1:21:36] <%maskofmichael> a little murder is okay, as a treat
[1:21:37] <KahnWick> @rayreborne that and because it was easy; I wanted to like it because the robo-dinos are cool but the rest of the game was just uninteresting.
[1:21:37] <+RandyFistburgers> Did somebody say murder?
[1:21:38] <DancesWitBalrog> MEGALUL
[1:21:39] <+joeyduderman> Couples that survive together stay together
[1:21:44] <luftraumm1> murder is super ok tho
[1:21:45] <%AncelDeLambert> the "Not You" square
[1:21:47] <%Ranryu692> I loved that meme format
[1:21:47] <BigFingerRo> NORMALIZE REMOVING PEOPLE FROM THIS PLANE
[1:21:48] <scrumbotime> Yes
[1:21:50] <+Felhad> Which Twitter has the dankness again?
[1:21:51] <+Ynkubus_> Not even a little murder, as a treat?
[1:21:52] <+McSoliace> murders only okay when you do it barehanded
[1:21:54] <RetroCop87> Guinen approves murder
[1:21:59] <$Puhff> NOT YOU
[1:21:59] <peachy996> The Center Never Lies
[1:22:00] <%Gouf_Troop> I can see that
[1:22:10] <Cozy90> Gainen LOVES MURDER
[1:22:10] <%MarylandJutsu> maybe Pat....*credits roll*
[1:22:11] <BigFingerRo> We need a less harsh sounding word for murder
[1:22:12] <%Gouf_Troop> She said some things about the holocaust
[1:22:12] <RetroCop87> Movie Guinen was fucking weird
[1:22:14] <DancesWitBalrog> If Whoopi says its okay, then Fuggins should totally murder
[1:22:15] <artoflec> lost judgment was the most conflicting murder is okay theme ive ever experienced
[1:22:15] <%arcaderabbit48> Yeah, that sounds like something she'd say. Within reason, but Whoopi knows when someone needs to be taken down
[1:22:15] <BigFingerRo> neutralization?
[1:22:17] <luftraumm1> wasn't that the whole point of Everhood?
[1:22:23] <Samuel412> Guinan tried to throw hands with Q. She don't give a fuck.
[1:22:30] <$Puhff> Fuuuuuck that
[1:22:52] <%arcaderabbit48> To Picard!?!
[1:22:54] <$Puhff> God, leave old people ALONE
[1:22:55] <%toolofparanoia> Guinan HATES the Borg, KILL EM ALL
[1:22:59] <+BiggusWingless> If you were a stand user you'd have understood it
[1:23:02] <RetroCop87> I want her to have that stupid sparkler gun in Picard
[1:23:08] <+Felhad> Does anyone not hate the Borg?
[1:23:11] <Cozy90> Pat is which is stronger mid series TNG or DS9
[1:23:11] <blackened61986> Remember when Guinan stabbed Q with a fucking fork?
[1:23:19] <+joeyduderman> Was it not Klingon Sign Language?
[1:23:23] <%MarylandJutsu> all my homies hate the borg
[1:23:30] <slushieShank> I wanna be the borg
[1:23:40] <+BiggusWingless> Remember when Obrien picked his cave woman daughter up by the ankle, spun her around and chucked her through a time portal?
[1:23:40] <slushieShank> always wanted to join a hivemind
[1:23:47] <DancesWitBalrog> embrace greed, paige
[1:24:00] <@ckbooks> I thought Pat meant Guinan was using her regression perk on the gens and that made me laugh.
[1:24:02] <%rumtumtugnutz> The best Star Trek show is Enterprise.
[1:24:08] <+typo114> Hi Peach
[1:24:10] <%toolofparanoia> The fact the Guinan knows Q is fantastic and I laughed super hard at that episode
[1:24:10] <+joeyduderman> @rumtumtugnutz WRONG
[1:24:26] <%Dakuu75> JESUS, that is TOUGH lol
[1:24:28] <%MarylandJutsu> Storm  said NO PAIGE
[1:24:29] <%ShinSanitater> So anyone else trying to just not die before elden ring comes out?
[1:24:29] <+Felhad> Vanguard was a rad MMO that didn't deserve to die, the Psionic class was all part of a hivemind (had a shared global chat)
[1:24:29] <$Puhff> It's DS9
[1:24:41] <$Puhff> No debate
[1:24:52] <+joeyduderman> DS9 LIFE!
[1:24:54] <+BiggusWingless> The only good Star trek is the episode of the animated series where they meet Stavos Kiniculous and create Giant Spock with a Giant Cock
[1:25:05] <%MarylandJutsu> pat going down ha ha nice
[1:25:08] <DancesWitBalrog> is everyone on the 1st floor?
[1:25:21] <blackened61986> Enterprise fails literally in the intro.
[1:25:48] <Zeif00> if that was a scourge hook, she can see you
[1:25:48] <@SoFarFetched> Paige will never leave the bush as pat dies.
[1:25:54] <%MarylandJutsu> Paige loves that bush
[1:25:56] <@SoFarFetched> PAIGE YOU HAVENT EVEN BEEN HOOKED geefDense
[1:25:59] <+Ragnakawaii> It's been a long road... Getten from there to here~
[1:26:01] <tank7013> Pat has not mastered the arts of the bush
[1:26:02] <+BiggusWingless> DS9 = TNG > TOS > ENT > VOY > STD > Picard
[1:26:07] <%rumtumtugnutz> Honestly, I fully believe that if DS9 hadn't been made nearly 30 years ago (i.e. If they were making exactly that show today) that it wouldn;t be nearly as successful or beloved as it was.
[1:26:08] <%MarylandJutsu> @SoFarFetched that's what we're here to see.
[1:26:11] <%Sotetsu> How could you do that , Paige.
[1:26:16] <DancesWitBalrog> nice3
[1:26:20] <artoflec> D:
[1:26:20] <Zeif00> Paige playing farmville over here
[1:26:23] <scrumbotime> pat, report paige for toxicity
[1:26:29] <@SoFarFetched> "Paaattttuuuu Im on thirrrd hoookkk! -is actually on 0 hooks-"
[1:26:31] <%MarylandJutsu> @Sotetsu very easily
[1:26:41] <$Puhff> Damn she spittin
[1:26:47] <$shurtal> she dolly cam's her way around, ti's great
[1:26:53] <DancesWitBalrog> yes
[1:26:57] <luftraumm1> abt the hoodies right
[1:27:01] <Azathotic> So what's with BHVR getting hot licenses for killers then making them terrible
[1:27:03] <%RayReborne> LMAO
[1:27:03] <$Trenr> oh man I saw that one how awful for them
[1:27:10] <$kawajenarts> god I just saw this
[1:27:11] <scrumbotime> SEVEN
[1:27:12] <%barrakuta371> Crypto Bros taking an L
[1:27:15] <@SoFarFetched> LUL
[1:27:17] <scrumbotime> SEVEN HOODIES?
[1:27:17] <%RayReborne> PFFFFFFFF
[1:27:17] <DancesWitBalrog> manchildren
[1:27:18] <%Ranryu692> that sounds fake
[1:27:19] <+Taisuru> LUL
[1:27:21] <tank7013> Good fucking lord
[1:27:23] <%toolofparanoia> Bored Ape more like BAD
[1:27:24] <blackened61986> I hate hoodies.
[1:27:25] <+joeyduderman> that was a performance piece, Pat
[1:27:25] <%RayReborne> Fucking absolute morons
[1:27:25] <%rumtumtugnutz> And yeah, for the record, I don't actually think Enterprise is the best example of Star Trek. i do believe if it hadn't been Star Trek that it would have been much, much more successful.
[1:27:26] <rudiciuscaesar> Oh shit, live Big Strong Lady
[1:27:28] <RetroCop87> sounds almost like satire
[1:27:29] <artoflec> its so stupid that it sounds fake but holy shit
[1:27:29] <officialdjkl> hi
[1:27:31] <%AncelDeLambert> sad people who probably listen to Pickup Artists
[1:27:34] <+Taisuru> That sounds fake
[1:27:34] <@ckbooks> These people can't be real but I know they are.
[1:27:38] <Azathotic> NFT cultists make Star Citizen cultists look sane
[1:27:39] <tank7013> Absolutely no self awareness
[1:27:39] <%Sotetsu> Bored Ape are the ugliest things ever made.
[1:27:41] <%MarylandJutsu> .......people who expect their clothes to get all the attention?
[1:27:43] <$kawajenarts> they're ALMOST there
[1:27:44] <+Ragnakawaii> Those bros need to stop getting hoodies and start getting some bitches
[1:27:46] <%rumtumtugnutz> Boxes shorts are like NFTs for your balls
[1:27:49] <$Puhff> Didya see where Musk posted a Hitler meme about Trudeau???
[1:27:51] <%toolofparanoia> MUH PERSONALITY IS MONKE
[1:27:58] <%Sotetsu> @peachsaliva Could you get 3 other survivors and so a match with Pat as Sadako?
[1:28:02] <tanarath> creepy49Porpkek That's it, hoodies are out if style.
[1:28:08] <$Puhff> Unhinged lil freak
[1:28:15] <%rumtumtugnutz> The Supreme brick
[1:28:17] <+Rofiarf> nfts just seem like artificial scarcity
[1:28:17] <+thotbane> Pat retweet it
[1:28:20] <valstriam> It's on brand, yeah
[1:28:21] <nameless_majin> And then they'll say "You just don't get it"
[1:28:21] <scrumbotime> conspicuous consumption, which means it serves no other function
[1:28:28] <%MightyDuckShoes> Were these same guys schuffed that people didn't react to their shitty Ahegao hoodies?
[1:28:33] <DancesWitBalrog> why didnt anyone compliment me on my CELINE plain hoodie??? its $800!!!
[1:28:34] <%rumtumtugnutz> Why is Pat imitating Patrick Stewart
[1:28:37] <eustine> Ha got em

[1:32:56] <@SoFarFetched> Dark meat is really tasty
[1:32:56] <luftraumm1> the WHOLE leg is the best
[1:33:02] <%KeiganOfAstora> Dark meat is just different
[1:33:05] <%MooseIsGoose> Chicken thighs are better
[1:33:06] <+BigCoffee> you gfotta inflate the foreskin however. That's where the word blowjob comes from, to save a life at sea
[1:33:07] <Gehtingsberg> thighs are superior
[1:33:08] <%KeiganOfAstora> Get some drumsticks
[1:33:09] <%MooseIsGoose> Dark meat the best
[1:33:10] <+thotbane> dark meat is better
[1:33:10] <%KngJester> chicken breast is for poor people with no taste
[1:33:11] <+CalderGaming> HEARTS

[1:33:19] <%KeiganOfAstora> Dark meat just hits different
[1:33:22] <%arcaderabbit48> Probably a texture thing
[1:33:24] <%SuckerPunchSyd> And its better imo
[1:33:24] <ergulor> aren't brest pretty tasteless on its own?
[1:33:27] <rudiciuscaesar> this could segway into a Paige killing women joke cuz she doesn't appreciate the breast meat
[1:33:27] <Gehtingsberg> I want to try them
[1:33:31] <luftraumm1> chiken hearts is great
[1:33:32] <tanarath> Paige is a thigh girl
[1:33:32] <+BigCoffee> I prefer chicken livers
[1:33:33] <%KngJester> fired chicken hearts is so good
[1:33:33] <%KeiganOfAstora> Paige eats the hearts of her victims, confirmed
[1:33:35] <luftraumm1> all rgans actually
[1:33:37] <%toolofparanoia> Have you ever had duck, I love duck
[1:33:37] <%SuckerPunchSyd> Ooh that sounds good
[1:33:42] <%Brassnarwhal> organ meat is pretty gross texture wise it freaks me out
[1:33:45] <+Taisuru> Congrats!
[1:33:46] <%Sotetsu> I had raw horse heart in Japan.
[1:33:47] <+GinAndRoses> goated
[1:33:47] <%barrakuta371> gg
[1:33:48] <+CalderGaming> brining chicken breasts helps a lot with flavor, only takes half an hour
[1:33:48] <DancesWitBalrog> chicken hearts at yakiniku restaurants are SO GEWWWDD
[1:33:49] <+vehementvadr> my cousin eats chicken gizzard exclusively, it's an abomination
[1:33:50] <+meatguyjay> @ergulor yep, no fat on a breast, but you know what does have plenty of fat on a chicken? the thighs.
[1:33:52] <@MelBrooksKA> Your problem is that chicken thighs are superior to chicken breasts
[1:33:54] <@SoFarFetched> Well pat said one more game
[1:33:56] <DusK_The_Stray> Damn they're good
[1:33:56] <@SoFarFetched> now he leaves
[1:33:56] <Ell1ot> my niece likes to eat those eggs with the baby duck inside of it
[1:33:57] <@SoFarFetched> geefO
[1:33:58] <%Brassnarwhal> anyway bedtime goodnight
[1:34:14] <rudiciuscaesar> ok wait, does Pat like coconut?
[1:34:14] <luftraumm1> why not both?
[1:34:17] <scrumbotime> i like the taste of liver and the smooth iron taste of bone marrow
[1:34:19] <VentWilsn> oh u were saying flavor
[1:34:20] <DancesWitBalrog> i want beef tongue
[1:34:21] <%lussuria156> lussuria156 subscribed with Prime. They've subscribed for 7 months! 
[1:34:23] <rudiciuscaesar> cuz that's usually a texture breakpoint
[1:34:25] <+McSoliace> is that why he hates pizza
[1:34:33] <nameless_majin> Agree with Pat
[1:34:36] <DusK_The_Stray> There are some kinda textures I cannot at ALL eat
[1:34:36] <DancesWitBalrog> pat hates pizza?
[1:34:43] <%RayReborne> what about wet without liquid?
[1:34:44] <%Gouf_Troop> what do you think of mushrooms pat?
[1:34:46] <Samuel412> I'm more sensitive to texture, presumably because I can't smell, so I probably have reduced taste.
[1:34:49] <GhoulishCripple> I can't eat cream of chicken soup because it's goo texture. so I fully understand you pat
[1:34:49] <luftraumm1> slime can be great, mussels and oysters are the best
[1:34:49] <%DoomUnderTheStairs> I LOVE THAT TEXTURE

[1:36:58] <+thotbane> crab is better
[1:37:00] <%Sotetsu> Crab is so much better than lobster
[1:37:03] <+derpmandwn999> Same
[1:37:03] <+McSoliace> its not an easy choice for me
[1:37:03] <Ell1ot> why not both?

[1:37:03] <+MegadBlitz> I haven't eaten lobster jn a minute to judge
[1:37:07] <+Ragnakawaii> Crab and lobster is fine as long as I don't have to break the shells myself
[1:37:09] <+CalderGaming> what kind of crab is prevalent in MTL?
[1:37:09] <DusK_The_Stray> I haven't had lobster in forever so I can't even remember
[1:37:11] <YakumoYomi> I only eat crab/lobster in sushi

[1:37:28] <%RayReborne> Pat ehatsthe crab thing with Woolie? it came up in his Miles Morales Vods and I'm not aware of the story
[1:37:32] <%SuckerPunchSyd> Breaking the shell is the best part!

[1:37:40] <%SuckerPunchSyd> I get to be feral
[1:37:40] <+SharpClaw_> but i's so much work though pat XD

[1:38:10] <Gehtingsberg> why does woolie have so many problems with food
[1:38:10] <%SuckerPunchSyd> The real question is crab or crawfish
[1:38:10] <@MelBrooksKA> Is Woolie a crab people?

[1:38:51] <%KeiganOfAstora> Either "too bad eat it" or "it's the devil, throw it out"
[1:38:53] <rudiciuscaesar> like how Woolie doesn't like white chocolate anymore cuz he had so much of it when he was little.
[1:38:53] <+McSoliace> that is the reason why i hate pasta

[1:39:42] <%mighty_max_t> For me: Cocoa Wheat. Hot goop is just the WORST
[1:39:47] <%MooseIsGoose> duck quesadilla was the worst for me

[1:46:58] <%MarylandJutsu> lemon stealing whores pasta?
[1:47:23] <+polothegreatest> LUL LUL
[1:47:24] <$chance_h> Is it similar to Bitch Lasagna?
[1:47:46] <+Taisuru> "Puttana" means Whore, so Puttanesca...
[1:47:46] <%MarylandJutsu> @chance_h also known as the pat lasagna
[1:47:55] <+BootyFriend> anchovies, olives, and capers hmmm
[1:47:55] <@CreepyPorpoise> oh jeeze
[1:48:05] <+shoryukenabotch> My gf will love this LUL
[1:48:06] <@CreepyPorpoise> she doesn't do the creepy broken crawl on the ground though
[1:48:08] <Gehtingsberg> sounds amazing
[1:48:21] <%MarylandJutsu> @CreepyPorpoise missed potential
[1:48:27] <%RayReborne> never had capers before
[1:48:29] <luftraumm1> capers are very salty
[1:48:30] <DancesWitBalrog> i dont think i ever had capers
[1:48:30] <+joeyduderman> Capers just called.  They love you too
[1:48:44] <Gehtingsberg> chicken picatta is the bomb
[1:48:46] <+Taisuru> What ARE capers exactly?
[1:48:48] <@CreepyPorpoise> jeeze
[1:48:57] <%rumtumtugnutz> Capers are pickled peppercorn berries
[1:48:58] <+joeyduderman> I am adorable
[1:49:00] <@MelBrooksKA> Why  does Paige keep running towards the monster?
[1:49:07] <+BootyFriend> Bet, I'll surprise her tomorrow when she gets home from work with it
[1:49:13] <%rumtumtugnutz> And they're *delicious*
[1:49:13] <Ell1ot> i kinda like the silly way you float over Sadako now
[1:49:16] <+Ragnakawaii> Is relish just pickle jam?
[1:49:19] <+ThomasOfTroy> Wowowow, Sadako looking like a cutie patootie creepy49Bigblush
[1:49:23] <+meatguyjay> Chicken Piccata is another awesome caper dish.
[1:49:30] <%rumtumtugnutz> Jam is just strawberry relish
[1:49:31] <@CreepyPorpoise> Relish is so sweet
[1:49:31] <Gehtingsberg> no shut up lol
[1:49:37] <%RetroCop87> relish is pickle cereal
[1:49:37] <%VentWilsn> apparently puttanesca could mean "hey i just put a bunch of shit in a pan"
[1:49:38] <@CreepyPorpoise> Yeaaah Paige understands
[1:49:38] <TheBraveLittleClaptrap> Is Sadako just a better Nurse?
[1:49:39] <californaya> they make dill relish
[1:49:40] <rudiciuscaesar> there's a bitter relish
[1:49:42] <@CreepyPorpoise> Salt superiority
[1:49:42] <@MelBrooksKA> You don't relish relish?
[1:49:43] <%MarylandJutsu> Paiges true love is mustard
[1:49:44] <DancesWitBalrog> wow pat

[1:49:45] <+Taisuru> As a fellow pickle person I also do not like relish

[1:53:12] <%RayReborne> how fittinf
[1:53:21] <%ShinSanitater> sadakos mori is NOT cute though

[1:53:31] <californaya> is that bouncy skill check thing new
[1:53:42] <DancesWitBalrog> i dont understand her VCR tape mechanic. are they tp points?
[1:53:47] <$chance_h> Yeah it came out with the last killer
[1:53:51] <@SoFarFetched> @californaya yeah its new,its so people don't fuck up their wrists/fingers as much with the mashing
[1:54:07] <californaya> neat
[1:54:10] <%Chichen> jesus christ my brain just read that as Helf Seal
[1:54:21] <%BootyFriend> BootyFriend subscribed with Prime. 
[1:54:31] <%Dakuu75> I always feel tired after Pat and Paige's streams because they make me laugh too much
[1:54:32] <octotasty> does sadako use the power of smallpox to kill in this game?
[1:54:34] <rudiciuscaesar> woah, Paige's character's ass when she runs...
[1:54:51] <%Ranryu692> @rudiciuscaesar why do you think she chose her?
[1:54:52] <$shurtal> Im unfamiliar with that species of seal
[1:54:55] <californaya> RIP
[1:55:03] <@MelBrooksKA> Paige likes her character's ass too
[1:55:12] <$chance_h> Be free weeb
[1:55:22] <+derpmandwn999> Mmm, toast
[1:55:25] <%Chichen> now just win the game by yourself richkidEZ
[1:56:02] <$chance_h> This killer is pretty scary since she has good mobility and a small size
[1:56:23] <%Chichen> PFFT
[1:56:29] <%Chichen> ok bye ghost
[1:56:29] <californaya> could you theoretically win by hiding in a closet
[1:56:37] <$chance_h> Lol, get holed
[1:56:47] <@SoFarFetched> sadako going for the slugging
[1:57:11] <+TopTieramisu> clever girl
[1:57:11] <DancesWitBalrog> RIP
[1:57:13] <%jinking79> wonder if this is Sadako where it revealed she a boy
[1:57:13] <%Chichen> F
[1:57:26] <+TopTieramisu> probably movie sadako, not book sadako
[1:57:28] <@SoFarFetched> this sadako is female.
[1:57:31] <Scorian> if this killer gets a red version of her gown it'll be like its alma from fear
[1:57:32] <+LadySaga_> am I the only one that feels the way she carries you looks a bit silly?
[1:57:32] <@CreepyPorpoise> up to the great spoder in the sky
[1:57:34] <DancesWitBalrog> "heavens"
[1:57:51] <$chance_h> Yeah the carry is really bad
[1:57:59] <octotasty> so no smallpox powers?
[1:58:05] <%RayReborne> Ass Comrade
[1:58:06] <gatekeeperkun> looked away for a second and now Peach is a good vtuber, how unexpected
[1:58:06] <rudiciuscaesar> Good use of Spoder
[1:58:08] <+TopTieramisu> no smallpox powers
[1:58:09] <%Ranryu692> @peachsaliva I think you missed a bits donation from me
