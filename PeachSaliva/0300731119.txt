[0:02:57] <+TsunamiPoro> NO SHE NEEDS TO SEE THE STORY
[0:02:57] <The_Introspector> I just got three achievements in this game just so I had a higher gamerscore than my friend. I'm petty.
[0:02:58] <%duneblythe> sipsipHonk
[0:03:00] <+Blargimazombie> Solo first please
[0:03:00] <Hawkbone_> I think they will do singleplayer first, because co-op has little story but what it does have is slightly spoilery to the main game
[0:03:01] <arcadeHemorrhage > PLAY THE STORY
[0:03:02] <$happyface699> oh boy
[0:03:03] <GPAlpha> Solo First!
[0:03:03] <PumaOfDarkness> HYPE IT BEGINS!

[0:04:12] <%redstonej> 1 big time
[0:04:12] <ckangaroo15k> SOLO FIRST
[0:04:13] <%Sinister_Aglet> twitter is dumb
[0:04:14] <Wyrmsblood> I've got my Tome of Town Portal ready
[0:04:15] <leole11> didn't pat imply he would figure solutions and then not tell her? doesn't that imply it's just solo?
[0:04:18] <%Remery_> More Mcdonalds messing up orders
[0:04:18] <RobotFaker> Welp never mind sleeping then if this is starting
[0:04:21] <The_Introspector> Last time I checked the Twitter poll co-op was winning.
[0:04:23] <devanmuse> the CoOp campaign is designed with the assumption that you played the solo, isn't it? Like... they don't introduce you to some of the new mechanics propwely, right? Starting with coop sounds like... an awful idea
[0:04:24] <$GohanEgret> L O O P S
[0:04:24] <$WorldSoup5> oof

[0:04:36] <$TheSniperJoe> F
[0:04:37] <+DigbyMayor> F
[0:04:37] <%jalford31> Yeah solo first, co-op first is really weird, and doesn't teach you the concepts as well.
[0:04:38] <+cvp5127> go home
[0:04:40] <$RubberFistFight> @FoxDiamondGaming yeah, i'd never go to twitter for game suggestions. I try to make my own decisions.

[0:04:49] <%YourFavoriteShiba> cheer300 Good to see someone else that will be burning some gears instead of me today. Trying to get into radiology make brain hurty.
[0:04:50] <frozenottsel> I don't have class tomorrow, how convenient : D
[0:04:50] <@MelBrooksKA> I wonder if my bus will come before the intro ends?
[0:04:51] <zal_silverfang> oh no. the baby elmo destroy more
[0:04:52] <%GeneralSCPatton> F. He was number 1!
[0:04:54] <arcadeHemorrhage > F he will always be no1
[0:04:55] <+Toynota10> I just voted on Twiiter and Co-op has 67% so that's what she'll probably be playing
[0:04:55] <+Blargimazombie> So today we get the better sibling
[0:04:58] <+Plutt_bug> I bet she will forget to turn off the intro music and it will be playing for the whole stream
[0:05:00] <jack_s1n> Co-op is portal 3
[0:05:01] <+TsunamiPoro> daisen no bakuden bites za dusto
[0:05:05] <%HelveticaScenario> What I want from this stream is solo campaign and McDonald's.
[0:05:08] <+lutefiiisk> Wackdonalds is late. 2 hour thank you stream 20 minute gameplay. Calling it now
[0:05:08] <grayjammer> If you voted for co-op you're an absolute mongrel
[0:05:09] <@WoolyFish> We're being blessed with many intro l√∂√∂ps
[0:05:11] <element_of_loyalty> Dis agree
[0:05:15] <+wolfeman1911> Did I miss it?
[0:05:16] <+fatal_penguin_> I hope we get another Paige and Pat's Wonderful Relationship Part 3 video from this

[0:50:25] <$konekoryugamine> Nah, the day these guys go ahead and stream horseporn is the day I eat my own show. Or draw Pat as Jotaro.
[0:50:26] <Gehtingsberg> Just do story mode

[0:50:54] <%TheOnlyStrayCat> cheer1000 If I fall asleep, I apologize, Paige. My sleep pattern is still fucked, with my YouTube stuff still my other big time-consumer outside of work. I even changed when I edit it and the recording schedule of what days I do what. Maybe it's the Oregon heatwave on top of the smoke from literally every fire on the damn west coast, including Canadia. Which province is on the west coast again?

[1:14:51] <element_of_loyalty> ANIME
[1:14:51] <+camodikk> im guessing woolie would be lester, matt would be kryten and pat would be rimmer?
[1:14:52] <$konekoryugamine> Oh wow, "unreason" IS indeed a word.
[1:14:54] <%jalford31> @fatal_penguin_ glados "died" so the facility fell into disrepair with no one mangaing the facility, also portal is in the half life world
[1:14:56] <flattopswag> Probably shouldn't imply Elmo is the one in the companion cube...
[1:14:58] <$konekoryugamine> Learn something new!

[1:17:00] <LokimenD> why
[1:17:00] <Jalexster> Do you see? Do you really?
[1:17:01] <%Hilleltaco> From the same source that is
[1:17:02] <fattness132> sbfpSetIn sbfpSetIn sbfpSetIn sbfpSetIn

[1:17:04] <+TsunamiPoro> PAIGE
[1:17:04] <+xxviios> Casca armor too
[1:17:05] <%RaikenTB> THERE CAN BE ONLY ONE.
[1:17:07] <battlebeast67> There's a character that looks like Casca in Dragon's Dogma.
[1:17:08] <+jkobe34> why
[1:17:10] <devanmuse> one cube per button
[1:17:12] <%Keyd00d> Dragon's Dogma is too long tho

[1:17:27] <+Dimfish> how could this be
[1:17:27] <$RubberFistFight> @PeachSaliva it has nothing to do with STD testing. Slaves used to sing it on plantations, and it predates the American civil war.
[1:17:27] <+skizzuto> HOW CAN THIS BE?
[1:17:28] <Jalexster> IT'S ALREADY BEGUN
[1:17:32] <nexoosen> tbfp dragons dogma when?
