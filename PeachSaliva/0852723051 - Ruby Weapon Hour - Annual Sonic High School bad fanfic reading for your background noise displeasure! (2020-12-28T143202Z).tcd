[0:19:59] <%umbypokochan> @razielhex damn... foiled again!
[0:20:00] <@SoFarFetched> the reverse of horny
[0:20:01] <visitingfan> like why do this to yourself and also to us
[0:20:02] <thesugardaddy111> its a sonic stream we know
[0:20:02] <mystrycarambola> THIS FAN fic is low brow as fuck
[0:20:04] <+angel949> 18 year old Sonic
[0:20:05] <+Prowtellen> TAKE IT SERIOUSLY.
[0:20:09] <+MelodyMedley> Very horny and dumb stuff
[0:20:15] <+cowardman93> bonk drone at the ready
[0:20:16] <@PinkieTheEerie> Use the gamer words paige!
[0:20:20] <%remainprofane> Uh oh sisters
[0:20:23] <+ah_clif> HI Peach!
[0:20:23] <%blaccbird914> very debaucherous
[0:20:27] <Buttsoup_Barnes> wait why is there racism in a sonic fanfic wtf
[0:20:27] <$hrbeck_> Sonic High School is sincere! It‚Äôs still real to me, dammit!
[0:20:28] <pokefan9956> did pat ever find the eekum bokum?
[0:20:29] <@PinkieTheEerie> The GAMER WORDS
[0:20:29] <@SoFarFetched> and no saying the word in here
[0:20:30] <+razielhex> What level is "Sonic High School" when compared to "Tails gets Trolled"?
[0:20:32] <%Derbisol> Return of the Slurlords
[0:20:34] <+ah_clif> I can't believe youre streaming in my night time!
[0:20:36] <peyodogo> im so ready
[0:20:36] <+thegreenbenis> Gonna read Sonichu? @PeachSaliva
[0:20:36] <+Kurt_0> Wet?
[0:20:36] <+ah_clif> :)
[0:20:36] <thesugardaddy111> not gonna be poppin off the gamer word?
[0:20:40] <visitingfan> tails gets trolled is unironically amazing
[0:20:43] <@PinkieTheEerie> No gamer words allowed
[0:20:48] <conspros> Is this an erotic story?
[0:20:49] <orpleborple> of course furry shit has discrimination
[0:20:51] <visitingfan> have you SEEN where that went?
[0:20:52] <@PinkieTheEerie> Nor heated gamer moments
[0:21:01] <+razielhex> Sonic is always erotic
[0:21:02] <+MidnightBurst12> maybe?
[0:21:02] <@SoFarFetched> maybe for some.....
[0:21:04] <+McSoliace> i recommend saying REDACTED instead of "slur"
[0:21:08] <+SergeEXE> Eroticism for GENERATIONS
[0:21:10] <%KineKithZen> You're not going to get banned for the bit? How dare you
[0:21:11] <visitingfan> can you dare to cpompare wily e coyote being a necromancer god to some horny highschoolers
[0:21:15] <Psyramics> tails gets trolled is brilliant tho?
[0:21:16] <thesugardaddy111> I have to say technically but not really
[0:21:18] <heart_ablaze> no one may utter the forbidden language of gamers
[0:21:18] <+razielhex> but the scenes don't last long; sonic's gotta go fast
[0:21:20] <@SoFarFetched> M'ustard Kappa
[0:21:20] <ItamarZel> Paige is making up words in order to keep us sane
[0:21:22] <+HefestoForges> This one is Beatoffable
[0:21:23] <%blaccbird914> can we do a reading of tails gets trolled after this?
[0:21:25] <+metzselaar> What chapter we starting on?
[0:21:25] <+EpicBigchill> I remember the "Sex Thanks" from the last strem

[0:30:36] <%MegboyManuel> So did you get old lady glasses?
[0:30:43] <heart_ablaze> yeah I don't get why squinting of all things offended people
[0:30:43] <badbrokuma> what about contact lenses??
[0:30:46] <%Lion_kun> If only you had your glasses.
[0:30:46] <neptious> someone needs to chain your lenses to your neck paigey
[0:30:46] <PrettyThickandStrongDyck> show us

[0:31:15] <%Marg0Pol0> Seriously Paige, with the low cost of Zenni Optical glasses how can you not have a great new pair of glasses? KappaHD
[0:31:16] <%MegboyManuel> atleast with the old woman glasses youre getting, youll look less hostile
[0:31:16] <%Lion_kun> You'd rather make enemies of strangers and friends than get glasses.
[0:31:17] <+McSoliace> if they get mad at you for saying you aren't wearing glasses then fuck them
[0:31:18] <visitingfan> man this chapter of sonic high school is super weird

[0:31:25] <+Kurt_0> Their problem I guess
[0:31:35] <ShineTheDiamond> Ok guys. We need to find an eye doctor and dress him as a skeleton to get Paige correct lenses.
[0:31:36] <+emperordread> women
[0:31:38] <%SweetCheeksTVR> SweetCheeksTVR subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 3 months! This is the point where having glasses would help, because you can at least put on a show of taking them off and rubbing them like you can't see. because you can't

[0:41:02] <+argavus> Sexist clothes
[0:41:02] <cureneckbeard> sew some pockets on
[0:41:03] <thesugardaddy111> just buy guy clothes
[0:41:04] <cureneckbeard> wear a bum bag
[0:41:05] <@PlagueOfGripes> God made kangaroos with pockets
[0:41:08] <$UberKingKai> Girls pockets suck!
[0:41:09] <+SergeEXE> You always have a Secret Pocket
[0:41:10] <+PleasantLee> women dont get praticality, men dont get fun clothes. thats matriarchy
[0:41:12] <super_robo_mg> double entendre
[0:41:12] <%Lion_kun> why do girls choose to wear horrible footwear?
[0:41:12] <Willfordbrimly> I am so tired of hearing people complain about this INSANELY EASY PROBLEM TO FIX
[0:41:13] <+angel949> Its so purses will sell more
[0:41:14] <@SoFarFetched> Hi plague
[0:41:14] <%Derbisol> It's real, I tried to sneak shit into the GF's pocket, and was shocked how shallow it was
[0:41:15] <%blaccbird914> I had an argument with my sister about pocketa
[0:41:17] <+smargh1015> so what sort of stream are we doing today
[0:41:18] <wannabemoogle> WE GET FAKE POCKETS
[0:41:20] <AMajorTom> @bob900000 chapter 20 I think.
[0:41:20] <+AugustHaze> Gotta sell those purses somehow
[0:41:21] <wibbwobbler> fake pockets are hilarious
[0:41:22] <+OmegaWeltall> if feeemales have pockets then they'd want to make profit!!! D:
[0:41:23] <thesugardaddy111> buy guy clothes
[0:41:26] <3XHAUST> i dont miss girl jeans & their fake pockets
[0:41:27] <oAznoUta> I am a staunch pocket enthusiast. everything should have them
[0:41:28] <+storebrandcandy> real fake pockets
[0:41:31] <Sunstalker> Girlc clothes and men's wallets are a scam

[0:41:47] <%FutaSnek> sipsipHonk
[0:41:55] <+D00msDayDan> Why the heck did it autocorrect pocket to pockey
[0:42:08] <@PinkieTheEerie> Fuccccck you
[0:42:22] <Willfordbrimly> BUT YOU WONT BC COMPLAINING IS MORE FUN
[0:42:24] <+storebrandcandy> I would shop for clothes more often if they came with pocky
[0:42:27] <+cowardman93> bombing?
[0:42:34] <cureneckbeard> Nobody talked about it because it was a white guy
[0:42:35] <+razielhex> My wife wrote a fanfiction between Jack Frost from Guardians and Queen Elsa from Frozen and it got super popular but she wouldn't let me read it because I suggested that Kuai Liang be the love interest.
[0:42:37] <%blaccbird914> on Christmas day
[0:42:37] <Teyaric> Because it was a Q-Anon bombing with 5-G as the guiding ideology. That's why no one talked about it.
[0:42:39] <rosemon5001> when its a domestic usually they try to hush hush it
[0:42:50] <%FutaSnek> If you mean the nashville things its probably cause there wasnt a ton of casualties
[0:42:55] <@SoFarFetched> you're trying to make out with us? D:
[0:42:57] <%Treuan> White supremacist suicide bombed the AT&T building. Phones and internet have been out but that's the extent of it
[0:42:57] <%FutaSnek> Not super news worthy
[0:43:09] <+Prowtellen> Wait, seriously?
[0:43:10] <%Lion_kun> only the suicide bomber died
[0:43:10] <DocMadfox> I had to learn about it from an Aussie friend, it was weird
[0:43:11] <Zaphire_Saucypants> from what I know, only the bomber died?
[0:43:11] <Willfordbrimly> Whats to talk about?
[0:43:12] <%Derbisol> Wow why is Paige so mad on this fine morning?

[0:43:57] <%FutaSnek> Some crazy dude blew himself up in a RV but oddly brodcast a warning message before he did so people could evacuate like 3 injuries

[1:07:00] <@SoFarFetched> 2012 is when it was written
[1:07:02] <Samex_Comex> What!?
[1:07:03] <heart_ablaze> wow this plot is so deep
[1:07:03] <$rdark_ksu> Knuckles got turned into a baby and is the child of Espio and Rouge
[1:07:03] <wannabemoogle> So that part in sonic dreams
[1:07:04] <+NWR_James> She loved him so much he became a baby
[1:07:08] <+AkronymCLT> is this the vaatividya lore?
[1:07:12] <+pingpong7045> Knuckles also looks like Espio.

[1:08:04] <@SoFarFetched> about to read 21
[1:08:08] <Samex_Comex> Thats a big butt
[1:08:09] <SilverRoddo> How many babies can she born in the frozen time?
[1:08:12] <heart_ablaze> some one jacked off to this shit
[1:08:15] <SGrim> @PeachSaliva knuckles didn't want to get in the way of Espio fucking Rouge, so he became Espio's son.
[1:08:16] <+McSoliace> the cloaca

[2:17:26] <CloniiCory> Fics like this or My Immortal, or Until the End of Time are special in that I don't think particularly bad fanfiction can rise to prominence in these days, the internets community is too different.

[2:18:59] <%SmolCircles> The hyper awareness thats drilled into children now of the fact that all that we do on the internet is cataloged forever makes it so people aren't as willing to post their musings like this anymore. Its truely a different age, a safer age, a boring age.
