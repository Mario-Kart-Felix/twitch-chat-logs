[0:14:16] <+connos_livereview> ASHLEY A BITCH
[0:14:17] <%snow_bush> @GarbageQueenEllie She just gets bad in other ways later on.
[0:14:18] <%AncelDeLambert> Ashley's an asshole, but she's not Carth
[0:14:19] <anar_bael> Oh...I thought we were talking about a person

[0:14:42] <%TheNeedlesD> nah but fuck ashley tho
[0:14:43] <Enemy_In_Disguise> Understandable. Still racist
[0:14:43] <GarbageQueenEllie> @snow_bush I still prefer her over "Diet Carth". What's wrong with his HAIR, anyway?
[0:14:44] <FracturedImage> shes still a cunt tho
[0:14:46] <+MisterTylerrr> She's a cunt, fuck your money
[0:14:48] <dragoon001914> Ashley is reasonably suspicious about aliens since humans are the new kids on the block but people who hate Ashley just want alien penises.
[0:14:48] <%ThePuddingDead> Basically not a good 1st impression
[0:14:49] <takiyami> Space racist -> Spacist
[0:14:49] <+gralho> Is this that famous Barefeet stream?
[0:14:52] <%SulfurousAcid> she's still a cunt
[0:14:53] <VanLynx> It explains it does not excuse
[0:14:53] <+G_Thunders> Well then she’s just an idiot
[0:14:54] <%neojadan> Ashley > KaidenCarth
[0:14:54] <+smargh1015> racism isnt justifiable
[0:14:55] <BlueMoonBlues> I thought we were talking RE4 Ashley
[0:14:55] <crimsonharvest> yo do not gotta under any circumstances gotta hand it to her, AKA space isis
[0:14:56] <dekkitout> damn, racism, why you gotta be like that
[0:14:58] <eddeehh> Ashley’s a jobber. Screw her SwiftRage
[0:14:59] <admiralsatan> ash is right. aliens are dicks.
[0:14:59] <$graffitisamurai> But she is still a cunt
[0:15:01] <fruit_pie_the_magician> I don't care if she's a cunt for reasons, shes still a cunt
[0:15:01] <craptierchromgar> “Cutie Cuntie”
[0:15:03] <shaneok64> still space racist
[0:15:03] <JDebss> It's not racism if they're not HUMAN!
[0:15:04] <+connos_livereview> THESE AL behds bruhda
[0:15:05] <energywarning> first contact war ACUTALLY about the movie contact
[0:15:06] <Garthunox> it's like why the imperial in ffxiv invade, minus the race war
[0:15:06] <alwayspronking> Pat is quiet D:
[0:15:06] <%snow_bush> @GarbageQueenEllie Don't laugh at Kaiden's meatloaf hair! He tries very hard
[0:15:06] <AmericanaRed> What a snowflake
[0:15:07] <cureneckbeard> It's okay that she's racist because she's sheltered
[0:15:08] <%AncelDeLambert> the war was, like, thirty years ago from the game's perspective.
[0:15:09] <PSI_Guy95> so really it's surprising MORE humans aren't space racists
[0:15:09] <$Sphincter_Spelunker> Nah, she's a cunt. Especially that one bit later
[0:15:10] <valriot> Yeah but shes still dry oatmeal bitch
[0:15:11] <%topendbuzz> SO HOT
[0:15:11] <Twoiis> Pat's mic is kinda..no good.
[0:15:11] <Rhinoprotoss> the aliens are way cooler
[0:15:12] <ScreamingMeat> Her grandpa was disgraced because he was forced to surrender Shanxi to the Turians during the FCW
[0:15:13] <GohanEgret> Kreygasm
[0:15:13] <$iwasJase> she still sucks tho LUL
[0:15:14] <tacostarvedbeast> “I can’t tell the aliens from the animals” Ashley, don’t forget @peachsaliva
[0:15:14] <%emoonimoo> ALL Turians are hot
[0:15:16] <Shonen_hero> She becomes a little less racist
[0:15:17] <$Gr4ndm4rsh4ll> but Pat are the aliens actually skeletons?!

[0:19:34] <SGrim> @gruib James Vega is the quintessential paragon of dumb ass meat head. I actually like him because he was designed to reflect the aggregate choices of all ME 1 Shepard's and let the character look back into their own past. Quite deep for Bioware. rooPog

[0:39:57] <%AnAsianToaster> i never understood why the generator is running while you try to fix it
[0:39:58] <@danzig2> streamers curse
[0:40:01] <%AncelDeLambert> a visual notification that is actually REALLY hard to see through!
[0:40:02] <%AggsMK7> Killer's all the way over there tho

[0:40:12] <FunkyStreams> Pat you're just here so were here so stfu
[0:40:12] <+PeaceCentennial> So the new killer is the TF2 spy, right? Is that how he works?
[0:40:12] <xeros720> introducing a new Killer: Eye Doctor
[0:40:12] <%ElenaManetta> Crows get a bad rap
[0:40:13] <PSI_Guy95> the killer gets paged about your failure
[0:40:13] <%Lumkins> We believe in you, Paige! We...we do
[0:40:16] <%AncelDeLambert> @Gruhunchously only if he has a skill
[0:40:16] <+TheArrow_> The killer has a stupid idiot gaydar
[0:40:18] <$DocMadfox> Downloading Dead By Daylight for this stream, going to try to get to be the killer and smack around a Paige
[0:40:18] <%Trinity5> info man, show pepis
[0:40:20] <%ElenaManetta> Should be ducks, ducks are a fuck
[0:40:21] <+InsaneJackLondon> GET EYES ON THE INSIDE

[0:40:21] <AlasterAngelo> crows did nothing wrong
[0:40:22] <eatdapancakes> Are there no perks that hide the explodey gen thingo?
[0:40:23] <+bigmuffpie> thanks for the commentary pat. this game is still confusing af
[0:40:24] <+MrSargent90> How good is this game for a person without friends to play with?
[0:40:24] <randomp141> Paige now stinks of petrol stink, the killer will smell her.
[0:40:28] <DraxTD> should we just throw Shadow Puzzles into this game @PeachSaliva ?
[0:40:28] <%Remery_> why does it says jewish on the back of her sweater?
[0:40:29] <Dementedpenguin> Well, if the Killer has BBQ, you're screwed anyway. DansGame
[0:40:29] <callsigneagle01> @baronvonphazon It's just a normal US style republic democracy thing. You are fighting for Osea but it's just not quite as clear. But Osea is one of the world's 2 superpowers alongside Yuketobania.
[0:40:29] <$BioStormX> I always played in the dark and every year my prescription got worse. Then the one year I started turning the light on, my eyes didn't get worse
[0:40:30] <+patriotrenegade> @PeachSaliva Isn't playing in the dark BAD for your eyes??
[0:40:30] <%CubicPhantom> I love that detail
[0:40:31] <myninjaway_> MORE ASMR normalGASM normalGASM normalGASM normalGASM
[0:40:33] <CerberusDriver> People can only see you if theyre looking at you.. hm
[0:40:34] <IminyourBase> Pat can you give us some Paige stats?
[0:40:38] <PSI_Guy95> so you can corner cheat but they can't
[0:40:40] <$DocMadfox> I play the Trapper dye to sharing his name
[0:40:41] <%AggsMK7> That served a purpose
[0:40:42] <+KilogramHours> @PeachSaliva Is this Bird Box?
[0:40:44] <%maskedriderhero> Paige he's right behind you! Hes right behind you!!!
[0:40:44] <$DocMadfox> due**
[0:40:48] <+patriotrenegade> @PeachSaliva What if the killer increases their FOV
[0:40:52] <$Solidnick18> how often do you get to play as the killer?
[0:40:54] <+Skeletorexplains> You can do it Peach, Rip that generator apart!
[0:40:55] <+connos_livereview> if he has silencers on his eyes you cant hear him looking at you
[0:40:55] <mxcoriginal> No engine works like this
[0:40:57] <%DesertPenguin09> Pat your informative voice is awesome
[0:40:59] <+ssulcer> But what does elmo think about the game?
[0:40:59] <%AnAsianToaster> do you fail the check if it spins around again?
[0:41:00] <GohanEgret> ! CURSED !
[0:41:01] <Fujiwara_92> ASMR PAT AND PRO GAMER PEACH Kreygasm

[0:41:15] <%AnAsianToaster> oh man i hate it when i can't raise fov
[0:41:15] <%TheNeedlesD> leave the talking to Pat
[0:41:15] <mxcoriginal> Why would an engine have the pistons moving on the OUTSIDE of the block
[0:41:16] <%Remery_> when will the killer get a gun
[0:41:16] <$palebluedots> Don't talk then
[0:41:17] <%ElenaManetta> just let pat talk
[0:41:17] <callsigneagle01> @baronvonphazon It's strangeral Russia
[0:41:18] <SirSmudgey> Monitor and Abuse also effects killer vision
[0:41:19] <Gruhunchously> I was like, when the killer gets a visual notification, is it static at you last known loccation or does it follow you?
[0:41:19] <%PatAndPaigeEnabler> You veg out to this?! I 'm so nervous!
[0:41:19] <sosuke5> DO YOUR BEST
[0:41:20] <%ElenaManetta> until you're in a safe place
[0:41:20] <PSI_Guy95> React react react react react react!
[0:41:21] <takokasa> Monitor and Abuse also increases your FOV, but only until you enter a chase
[0:41:21] <+EndarspireJ> you can play as the killer whenever
[0:41:22] <%Blain_Cooper> LP TAX
[0:41:23] <%AnAsianToaster> i need at least 90 to not feel sick
[0:41:24] <xeros720> it's why Pat doesn't think about what he says
[0:41:25] <baronvonphazon> oh now that makes sense

[0:41:43] <%SiameseSneeze> ???
[0:41:43] <$Sphincter_Spelunker> Swish, 3 points
[0:41:43] <$Solidnick18> you could juke them
[0:41:46] <%NovaKnightmare> if the killer is smart, he may know that
[0:41:46] <%wizkid50000> Fun Fact: DBD is 50% off on Steam RN along with a bunch of DLC on sale
[0:41:50] <callsigneagle01> @baronvonphazon and it's the other giant ass country across the ocean from Osea. The two going to war was the focul point of 5
[0:41:51] <%ElenaManetta> Is it a literal pop up in the corner QUEST tier notify or like, a ding on the map with a circle appearing through the geometry
[0:41:52] <%MightyMaxT> How similar is it, gameplay wise, to the Friday the 13th game?
[0:41:53] <bendatron> @PeachSaliva hey pat did you ever finish xenoblade 2

[0:42:51] <callsigneagle01> @baronvonphazon Though Osea and Yuketobania didn't really have anything to do with Erusia or Usea before this. It's politics with the rest of Usea were totally seperate.

[0:43:49] <+skizzuto> are you 100% safe in the lockers or can the killer pull you out if they know you're there?

[0:54:29] <+patriotrenegade> @PeachSaliva DYK: Michael Myers is referred to as "The Shape" in the "Halloween" movies
[0:54:31] <callsigneagle01> @baronvonphazon Yeah, there's always just a little bit. One of the reasons Zero was like that was it had an 'ace style' meter that let you determine that. It switched between 'Mercenary', 'Soldier', and 'Knight' based on what targets you kill and how many, and it effects what boss squadrons you fight and some of the dialogue.
[0:54:31] <NikWritesStuff> but Paige, saying "good game" if you won is considered toxic and may get you banned

[1:16:37] <%starotter70> And then 13 year olds get mad
[1:16:37] <LiquidMathew> Oops I did it again
[1:16:38] <%Kinoskae> I rebound my struggle key to scrolling the mouse wheel down b/c it's a lot easier than mashing the spacebar
[1:16:38] <Coystick> Still your balls in my asshole -Paige Saliva 2019
[1:16:39] <masso101> Toxic means you're a NoTsEe
[1:16:39] <MyNameIsRasus> Cause I know that she's toxic
[1:16:40] <+chetasaur> lupus girl
[1:16:41] <+connos_livereview> NA NA NANANAH
[1:16:41] <Yummy_Nukes> toxicity has never been so cute!
[1:16:42] <+PeaceCentennial> *VIOLINS INTENSIFY*
[1:16:43] <tacostarvedbeast> Poor intern pat takes the abuse
[1:16:43] <ScreamingMeat> Bawls in the Ayuss
[1:16:46] <%ThatGuyfromMars> I'd say she's Lucky
[1:16:49] <randomp141> @PeachSaliva Sounds more like infectious, as toxin's cause degradation.
[1:16:49] <%Blain_Cooper> That song where Britney sings about balls in her ass
[1:16:49] <eatdapancakes> It's only toxic if you shout directly at the other folk, from what I know.
[1:16:50] <+Reevesypoo> If You Seek Amy
[1:16:51] <%ElenaManetta> HEY LOOK AT THAT SKIRT LADY SHE'S COOL
[1:16:52] <GohanEgret> @PeachSaliva I think folks talking about "being toxic" is like the overuse and misuse of "triggered"
[1:16:52] <+TerryTrojanWaterDistrict> da coin
[1:16:53] <%umbypokochan> toxic is when the poison gets worse every turn
[1:16:55] <ipwnlocks> ALWAYS burn offerings
[1:16:58] <%Lumkins> "I am a Britney Spears song!"
[1:17:00] <Kaitepaints> @Kinoskae good idea
[1:17:00] <spiegspikel> @gruhunchously Damn. My bad. It’s pretty easy to confuse the two
[1:17:00] <kingkyleedd> The toxciscity of our city of our streammm
[1:17:01] <tearsaurther> @peachsaliva sounds like thought crimes and sensitive skin people to me
[1:17:02] <%jiin6> Toxic is the media's new buzzword
[1:17:05] <lewdskeletor13> WITH THE TASTE OF YOUR LIPS IM ON A RIDE
[1:17:05] <baronvonphazon> @PeachSaliva does the killer smacking you when your on a hook do anything or is it just BM?
[1:17:05] <eatdapancakes> Also if you're a mediocre Britney Spears song
[1:17:06] <%AncelDeLambert> I don't like how most of your inventory is a one-time use
[1:17:08] <$Sphincter_Spelunker> hooker boots too
[1:17:10] <VritraReiRei> @PeachSaliva hence why you're not considered toxic, just wash your mouth with GARBALAGE

[1:17:34] <austincoffee5000> fashion before practicality
[1:17:36] <+skizzuto> this game seems fun but I hate the idea of consumable items in a multiplayer game's loadout for some reason

[2:10:53] <+BoboDaHobo> what about Joker from persona 5?
[2:10:55] <rockworm> Waluigi should be the next killer to make up for Nintendo giving him no love
[2:10:57] <+Sora20030c> a The Thing monster would be hype
[2:10:58] <Enemy_In_Disguise> ManBearPig is too strong of a pick

[2:11:22] <eatdapancakes> ....You joke, but Shadow Joker would be fucking rad

[2:11:23] <%king_wragles> woolieMIRIN
[2:11:23] <masso101> Randy Pitchford should be in it, he's already a predator in real life...
[2:11:25] <+illustriouslangley> The worst killer of all, DIABEETUS
[2:11:26] <callsigneagle01> Sanic?

[2:11:31] <SchroedingersFerret> Replace all killers with Scooby Doo villains.
[2:11:31] <callsigneagle01> Murderous Sanic?
[2:11:31] <Zzross_the_savagezz> Predator
[2:11:33] <Corporate_Redeemer> His gimmick is a guaranteed kill after 3-5 stabs, he runs, and jumps over pallets
[2:11:34] <%Puppet88> legions gimmick is being the worst killer in dbd and needs to be deleted
[2:11:34] <Zantetzuken> generator performance at risk
[2:11:34] <Gruhunchously> @masso101 oof
[2:11:42] <haisho> isn't Legion like...4 people
[2:11:42] <callsigneagle01> Oh NM he's Shadow
[2:11:42] <%Darkfire346> What about that chick who was the killer and also a dude?
[2:11:43] <person181> what's the downside?
[2:11:46] <eatdapancakes> i don't think dbd needs Sonic.exe tho
[2:11:47] <Stratrat> sounds like a son of a bitch
[2:11:48] <$ooblagis> That sounds broken
[2:11:51] <%maskedriderhero> Also Legion has multiple "characters' you can choose from, including a GIRL
[2:11:51] <randomp141> Legion has backs.
[2:11:52] <%Remery_> He's a druggie that runs around shanking people
[2:11:53] <$FrostMass22> He's actually bad?
[2:11:53] <%Raxus_Secundus> You did it
[2:11:56] <Gruhunchously> Pamela Voerhees?
[2:11:57] <LeishmaniaForever> This game needs a generator Mimic
[2:11:59] <Sotetsu> What balances Legion out, then?
[2:12:00] <%jiin6> Legion Assassins? Caesar marks you for death and the LEGION OBEYS
[2:12:01] <+Gravity_Gunner> mikeliveMarshmallow
[2:12:01] <+PaladinDupre> @PeachSaliva THE PREDATOR
[2:12:02] <+CarlosEoM> he can also wave dash
[2:12:03] <lizard0tm> He also needs to hit 3 times I think
[2:12:06] <+Yodifest> is legion op
[2:12:10] <giga_bit> he's actually really tame guys, not as strong as you'd think
[2:12:11] <%Raxus_Secundus> Yes, game needs a mimic
[2:12:14] <%CubicPhantom> What's his Side-B?
[2:12:16] <SirSmudgey> Legion is weak ass hell
[2:12:18] <EmilyOverdrive> But does he have a double jump?
[2:12:19] <Zaxshimysham> so many new players complained that he was bad now everyone points out how OP he is
[2:12:21] <Ayru_> i'm fast as fuck boi
[2:12:25] <%Darkfire346> Generator mimic!
[2:12:26] <eatdapancakes> I... thiiiink Pamela might break copyright, even with the Firday the 13th game being dead.
[2:12:26] <%iwishthiswasicq> But how's his recovery though?
[2:12:26] <%Remery_> he's pretty weak, just a nuisance
[2:12:26] <deviljhojho94> S P E E D
[2:12:27] <Dacaulk> He also can only see other survivors inside his terror when he stabs
[2:12:28] <+Sora20030c> so he's a chaser?
[2:12:28] <%bloodypurpledog> Put in the gay icon the Babadook
[2:12:28] <benjiFG> ! Bleed !
[2:12:29] <$Cavumentum> Okay but can he chaingrab space animals
[2:12:30] <FunkyStreams> runnin around at the speed of sound got people to kill doin it for the thrill yeeea
[2:12:30] <%Raxus_Secundus> Dark souls mimic to be particular
[2:12:30] <+tigerfang86> still fast as fuck boi
[2:12:31] <eco419> sanic
[2:12:32] <nomad480> gotta go fast!
[2:12:33] <+Grayhammatter> ah ha
[2:12:34] <Yummy_Nukes> @peachsaliva THE PREDATOR WITH ARNOLD SCHWARZENEGGER SURVIVOR
[2:12:34] <mesamus> legion is a reference to the purge,no?
[2:12:35] <druvirus> What about the Norman Bates from Psycho?
[2:12:35] <deviljhojho94> Ah-ha
[2:12:36] <grayjammer> s p e e d
[2:12:37] <dekkitout> go bleed racer go
[2:12:38] <LeishmaniaForever> Its a mimic!
[2:12:40] <giga_bit> I wish he was better, i honestly like the concept
[2:12:42] <OwlLightningMage> They should put in Undertaker
[2:12:43] <%king_wragles> @Yodifest from the sound of it, they're all OP in a way. The only difference in strength is how versatile their OP attribute is
[2:12:43] <%GeneralSCPatton> Final Destination would be a great killer. Call it Fate or Omen.
[2:12:46] <Corporate_Redeemer> Legion is the least fun killer to play as, not the worst. He's just really boring since he can tunnel the fuck out of you and you can't do much since he can jump over pallets.
[2:12:52] <Firesparks> paige, at least play one game as killer?
[2:12:53] <deadredeyez> bason doorhees
[2:12:53] <DedlokPM> @mesamus pretty much, but not officially so
[2:12:53] <+j3nngor387> A Wilfred Brimley Thing Monster would be awesome
[2:12:54] <+Grayhammatter> paige, why are you crouching?
[2:12:56] <masso101> What about a Elmo killer?
[2:12:56] <randomp141> @PeachSaliva So is Legion Blue??? ANd HedgeHog shaped???
[2:12:58] <callsigneagle01> They should put in Chris Benoit
[2:13:01] <Corporate_Redeemer> play against, not play as***
[2:13:07] <eatdapancakes> Elmo would be broken.
[2:13:09] <DesuDesuDokiDoki> too blacc
[2:13:10] <Laecerelius> Too bad Legion isn't like multiple killers that you can switch between and place strategically around the map
[2:13:12] <+BorinCorran> @eatdapancakes Depends if Victor Miller is involved. Since I think post-lawsuit he got her rights.
[2:13:21] <Enemy_In_Disguise> Put In Pumkinhead
[2:13:21] <eatdapancakes> ....Hmmm....
[2:13:21] <zettig> !uptime

[3:00:30] <%AncelDeLambert> Hey, it's the Until Dawn house
[3:00:30] <rockworm> looks like one of the survivors is griefing

[3:10:02] <SociallyAwkwardToaster> VAULT THE PALLET
[3:10:02] <+TempestaDePrimo> Legion is a stand
[3:10:04] <%galaxyswirl> stalling
[3:10:05] <%GarbageNirvana> Doesn't seem like it's beneficial

[3:10:31] <$AgentTexes> @GarbageNirvana Frenzy makes you fast and get a free hit.
[3:10:44] <+dumemoto> Sure, he could vault. But if he destroys them. He wont have to worry about them anymore
[3:10:45] <%GarbageNirvana> Ah, okay
[3:10:49] <%wizkid50000> WHISPERS IS BAD
[3:10:51] <%ElenaManetta> Pat you said you were going to have an even amount of game explanation and balls in your ass talk. What the heck.
[3:10:59] <lautalocos> wasnt the guy crouching just there?
[3:11:18] <$AgentTexes> @GarbageNirvana As well as put a debuff that makes them die if they don't mend themselves in a certain time period.
[3:11:20] <ShadowSketches> Pat you should try to get BBq and Chili from Leatherface as soon as you can, its great for finding survivors
[3:11:21] <%ElenaManetta> The killer looks REALLY overpowered in this scenario.,
[3:11:24] <%Remery_> "These hobo children keep shanking me"
[3:11:25] <+stolando_florida> Got knifed in the taint like Ghaddafi
[3:11:26] <%ThePuddingDead> leave him to crawl
[3:11:27] <%ElenaManetta> Like Pat is having no trouble with any of these guys
[3:11:28] <%Raxus_Secundus> Get them!
[3:11:32] <Valdorick> Gotcha bitch
[3:11:34] <+Demerson13> Legion is SO dumb
[3:11:40] <ipwnlocks> @ElenaManetta legion is weak
[3:11:41] <Firesparks> is bill going to be the sole survivor?
[3:11:42] <%Keyd00d> AAAAAAAAAAAAAA

[3:11:44] <Idon__> aaaaaah
[3:11:46] <$joylent_blue> that scream LUL
[3:11:46] <Yummy_Nukes> HA, GOTCHA BITCH

[3:11:50] <+universboy95> This is one of the worst killers btw folks
[3:11:50] <+Skeletorexplains> AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAaaaaaaaaaaaaaa
[3:11:52] <%ElenaManetta> But the speed buff is so long and the downtime is so tiny
[3:11:56] <dekkitout> its been awhile since i seen a ghaddafi reference
[3:11:58] <Maleicus> i sure hope bill makes it
[3:12:03] <alwayspronking> Or hatch?
[3:12:05] <DesuDesuDokiDoki> pat is good
[3:12:06] <eatdapancakes> ...The hatch, possibly?
[3:12:09] <%king_wragles> It's a clustered map, but it's not claustrophobic so Legion is able to do his dirt (from what I can tell, haven't played this yet)
[3:12:10] <OwlLightningMage> Spongebob tried to warn us about the dangers of hook masturbation BibleThump
[3:12:10] <%Keyd00d> AHA

[3:12:36] <+BeardedLuchador> Kappa
[3:12:44] <FunkyStreams> Pat I don't know if you remember or not but you explicitly said the exact opposite of whats happening now would happen.
[3:12:45] <$AgentTexes> @ElenaManetta Legion is only weak if you play him as the devs intended. If you tunnel one person at a time he's literally unbeatable because once they're bleeding there is literally nothing the survivor can do if the killer decides to tunnel.
[3:12:47] <LtThunderbolt> this is Legion territory now profligate
[3:12:48] <+intothfanfiction> they might bleed out and fall down
[3:12:50] <ShadowSketches> you shoulda gotten out of your power while he was unhooking him
[3:12:55] <@PlagueOfGripes> you lose 30 if the guy you pulled off the hook gets attacked a few seconds after you save them
[3:12:55] <ShadowSketches> you woulda had time to hit them
[3:12:58] <Corporate_Redeemer> You could've just grabbed Bill as he was unhooking him
[3:13:10] <Corporate_Redeemer> or hit him
[3:13:13] <%Remery_> and now you see why this killer is weak you have to be bad to die from him
[3:13:13] <+Smashking91> Nooo u missed blood on floor
[3:13:23] <+Smashking91> Follow those blood trails
[3:13:24] <%Remery_> mending is too easy
[3:13:24] <sparrrow_> big dumb small Pat
[3:13:25] <pennykettle_> or kissed him
[3:13:26] <+Yodifest> u let em go
[3:13:27] <ZeeJiggle> Ah well.
[3:13:28] <SirSmudgey> Can someone tell Pat/Paige the bleedout never finishes while healing
[3:13:28] <%ElenaManetta> I forgot I had a big knife...
[3:13:31] <+Skeletorexplains> don't forget the hatch
[3:13:33] <%galaxyswirl> umm

[3:14:01] <+wolfeman1911> The stream says 'Ruby Weapon Hour,' but Pat is playing. This does not compute.

[3:14:04] <%Aitch971> BLIND
[3:14:10] <$AgentTexes> @Remery_ No, Pat is just not really good. Put Legion in the hands of someone who knows how to cheese with him and you can't do anything.
[3:14:15] <+FloorBurger> hit the hatch
[3:14:17] <%ElenaManetta> WHY DOES IT SOUND LIKE THAT WHY IS IT SO SCARY
[3:14:17] <+universboy95> What are Pats perks?

[3:15:57] <+universboy95> You downed him but he can still jump in
[3:15:57] <$AgentTexes> @Remery_ Dude, you don't need to be rank 1 to cheese with him. You literally just need to get the free hit with frenzy and then moonwalk them to death.
[3:16:00] <LiquidMathew> Are you winning son?

[3:16:47] <%TheMilhouseExperience> Good luck. You are going to need it.
[3:16:51] <%ThePuddingDead> this is nice stream
[3:16:52] <%Remery_> @AgentTexes against good survivors? I don't think so
[3:16:52] <OwlLightningMage> Isn't Freddy the worst killer in the game?
[3:16:58] <%ElenaManetta> gonna go into a 3AM stream, eh?
[3:16:59] <%galaxyswirl> @OwlLightningMage yes
[3:17:03] <+Smashking91> The second worse killer lol
[3:17:03] <randomp141> Elmo is comfy and chillin like a kitty.
[3:17:03] <+universboy95> Yup
[3:17:05] <lupus_man> Give thank
[3:17:05] <sparrrow_> So is this game basically a better version of the Friday the 13th game?
[3:17:05] <eatdapancakes> DbD goes on sale more often than not, I've noticed
[3:17:07] <@PlagueOfGripes> killer really has to be wasting time
[3:17:07] <ShadowSketches> Freddy is the worse, but these arent high tiers so it shouldnt be too bad
[3:17:09] <OwlLightningMage> I'm hearing yes LUL
[3:17:13] <ipwnlocks> @OwlLightningMage he needs addons and perks to be good
[3:17:15] <%TheMilhouseExperience> Freddy is widely agreed to be the worst killer.
[3:17:19] <rockworm> i have so much fun playing Freddy but he's so hard
[3:17:25] <Yummy_Nukes> Sleepy time fun time
[3:17:28] <Corporate_Redeemer> His terror radius is the 1,2,3 song
[3:17:29] <%ElenaManetta> !uptime
[3:17:30] <LtThunderbolt> M A T H
[3:17:32] <%king_wragles> 1
[3:17:32] <$AgentTexes> @Remery_ Do you actually play this game? Cause it sounds like you have no idea what you're talking about.
[3:17:32] <%ElenaManetta> MOOBOT
[3:17:33] <$Sphincter_Spelunker> quick maffs
[3:17:33] <RichAnvils> BIG FUN = FAST TIME
[3:17:34] <%galaxyswirl> freddy and wraith are the worst and second worst killer
[3:17:41] <%ZeOrbling> FEET
[3:17:41] <+Smashking91> Legion is a little worse IMO
[3:17:45] <Run44forrest> 5 hour stream gooo
[3:17:48] <%Remery_> @AgentTexes Dude I'm fucking with you, who gives a fuck
[3:17:51] <+ItsNineTen> @peachsaliva you have the wiggle timing wrong, youre supposed to press each button for about a second at a time and the meter fills faster
[3:17:52] <%Puppet88> WRAITH BAD?????
[3:17:54] <+MechaBaphomet> FNAF
[3:17:56] <Yummy_Nukes> PEACH FEET
[3:17:57] <Corporate_Redeemer> THAT'S WRONG
[3:17:58] <Valdorick> Math works by rounding to the biggest hugest number. FACTS.
[3:17:59] <ShadowSketches> Wraith is not the 2nd worse killer, he's bad but not that bad
[3:17:59] <+universboy95> Wraith is fine
[3:18:00] <%Dotta5> Elmo kills stream
[3:18:00] <%Puppet88> WHOMST
[3:18:00] <+TempestaDePrimo> Maybe yall just suck
[3:18:00] <+brickwall35> wrong
[3:18:01] <%wizkid50000> WRONG, Wraith has gotten buffed big
[3:18:02] <DedlokPM> Wraith USED to but they bufffed him months ago
[3:18:04] <@StridentSong> Wraith is the second-lowest tier killer
[3:18:04] <%galaxyswirl> you can still see him when he is camo
[3:18:05] <+meatwhole> no leatherface is way worse
[3:18:05] <%king_wragles> What? Wraith is dope!
[3:18:08] <+Smashking91> Wraith got better after buff
[3:18:08] <Corporate_Redeemer> WRAITH IS NICE
[3:18:09] <@PlagueOfGripes> freddy is good against new players, useless against old ones
[3:18:10] <$MajorCrasher> wraith is great, meyers sucks
[3:18:11] <%Puppet88> WRAITH A STRONG BOY
[3:18:14] <%king_wragles> [I have no idea who Wraith is]
[3:18:21] <giga_bit> Wraith uncloak time is so easy to cheese, evne after that """"buff"""" they gave him.
[3:18:22] <suikudo> this looks dope
[3:18:24] <haisho> god this game is making me miss Evolve so much, but that game fucked itself so eh
[3:18:25] <Damashi_The_Kaotic> You struggle with Wraith because you are BLIND Paige
[3:18:29] <bayowolfterra> wiggling works if someone spends all game sabotaging, but the survivors got other problems if that's the case.
[3:18:32] <+TempestaDePrimo> This is the biggest dumb lmao
[3:18:32] <%ThePuddingDead> ....ok
[3:18:33] <OwlLightningMage> A Hunter's dream
[3:18:33] <DedlokPM> @king_wragles can go invisible and visible by ringing a bell
[3:18:36] <dekkitout> so like limbo, but invisible
[3:18:39] <@PlagueOfGripes> they cant see him
[3:18:41] <krymzen5> its like the remake visually
[3:18:46] <Corporate_Redeemer> Freddy is so bad that they're going to rework him
[3:18:56] <Run44forrest> lmaoooo
[3:18:56] <%ThePuddingDead> you have no feet
[3:18:59] <%TheMilhouseExperience> Wow that was awful.
[3:18:59] <tacostarvedbeast> Freddy should be able to summon Kevin bacon to attract victims
[3:19:00] <%galaxyswirl> dont get me wrong, i love wraith but yea he HAS to have 1 specific add on to even get kills
[3:19:00] <+TempestaDePrimo> I have a dream - Freddy
[3:19:08] <Idon__> WHIFF
[3:19:10] <%wizkid50000> Rework, its been literally a year
[3:19:16] <%Remery_> it's about time, hope they make him taller, he's like Pat height
[3:19:16] <%Raxus_Secundus> Big jukes
[3:19:19] <%Puppet88> the darn boy
[3:19:20] <$AgentTexes> They said that a year ago and the rework isn't coming any time soon. @PeachSaliva
[3:19:21] <ipwnlocks> dead 'ard
[3:19:22] <@PlagueOfGripes> they need to add more mechanics to the game
[3:19:22] <%ThePuddingDead> you might as well hook and stab him in the dream
[3:19:25] <Corporate_Redeemer> I love the finger wiggle
[3:19:25] <randomp141> Paige likes pedos.
[3:19:29] <OwlLightningMage> Nyx needs a damn rework
[3:19:30] <Idon__> AAAAAAAAAAH
[3:19:32] <%ElenaManetta> AAAAAAARGRGRGHHHHHHAHABLALGH
[3:19:36] <Yummy_Nukes> sleepy murder boi
[3:19:36] <+Smashking91> Not too great just used dead hard perk
[3:19:38] <ShadowSketches> When theyre in the dream any messed up skill check wakes them up and it slows down all their action speed
[3:19:38] <BrachyZoid> That development hell
[3:19:38] <raypoint_223> Big counters are people can wake thmeselves up with most failed skillchecks like self care and failing gens
[3:19:39] <+SWindleFeD> blades aren't rubbing together, still get the metal on metal sound.....wut?
[3:19:41] <@StridentSong> I'd love if they had even more then *just* "Repair the Generators"
[3:19:43] <Firesparks> who's the best killer?
[3:19:45] <+Yodifest> whys he so bad
[3:19:45] <dekkitout> nyx just got a rework NotLikeThis
[3:19:45] <$Sphincter_Spelunker> Freddy Kruegar @PeachSaliva
[3:19:48] <$palebluedots> What does the dream do?
[3:19:48] <mercado94> oh boy
[3:19:51] <DesuDesuDokiDoki> freddy is a pedo
[3:19:51] <%Puppet88> ???????
[3:19:52] <pennykettle_> nathanWat dumb comments
[3:19:52] <randomp141> Freddy is a pedo
[3:19:54] <%galaxyswirl> lul
[3:19:54] <Tooniearcade> They should have put in Scary Terry instead
[3:19:57] <OwlLightningMage> Nyx got a "rework"
[3:19:58] <randomp141> He was a pedophile who was burned alive.
[3:20:00] <%AncelDeLambert> someone cruisin for a ban
[3:20:01] <+TheArrow_> i like how you pull them to the dream world, but at the end of the day you still have to hook them up
[3:20:03] <%nofestu2> Because Freddy is a pedo
[3:20:04] <Corporate_Redeemer> Freddy used to be super good but then Survivors complained and he got nerfed into oblivion.
[3:20:05] <%AncelDeLambert> AAAAAH okay
[3:20:08] <%Puppet88> ooooooh
[3:20:08] <$Sphincter_Spelunker> The movie Paige
[3:20:09] <Smaenus> Isn't he only in his newest movie?
[3:20:10] <krymzen5> freddyis indeed a pedo
[3:20:12] <$Sphincter_Spelunker> His origin
[3:20:12] <Idon__> ooooh yeah
[3:20:13] <%AncelDeLambert> all is forgiven
[3:20:16] <DesuDesuDokiDoki> lol
[3:20:17] <Mopopolis> They have to snap out of it too if they escape, so takes at least 2 players away from gens
[3:20:18] <Idon__> yeeeaaaaaah
[3:20:19] <@PlagueOfGripes> gasp, he did evil
[3:20:22] <%ElenaManetta> Freddy did nothing wrong
[3:20:23] <ShadowSketches> So if people have selfcare if Freddy puts them to sleep they can heal themselves than mess up the skill check to wake them up
[3:20:23] <$FrostMass22> Yeah, in that remake thet retcon Freddy Krueger to have molested children before he became a supernatural entity
[3:20:25] <%krawtch> isnt he also a fictional character who doesnt exist
[3:20:25] <%Puppet88> you dont though oat
[3:20:27] <%wizkid50000> Pat, you just do it once
[3:20:28] <OwlLightningMage> Vauban needs a rework too
[3:20:30] <Zaxshimysham> you don't need to hold it
[3:20:32] <randomp141> No trying to take a shot at you, just saying he is just that.
[3:20:32] <+connos_livereview> fredo
[3:20:33] <+Ace9817> Almost like he's supposed to be a terrible human being?
[3:20:34] <+Smashking91> Night chat, glhf
[3:20:34] <ShadowSketches> and Pat you dont have to hold on to it, you just click on them once
[3:20:34] <SirSmudgey> YOU DONT HAVE TO HOLD IT PAT
[3:20:34] <Mopopolis> You dont have to hold on with it
[3:20:35] <Yummy_Nukes> "He's a cool killer"
[3:20:35] <Valdorick> He's a Pedo, yeah, but he's also a murderer, what, you're saying the problem you guys have is that he's a kiddy diddler and not that he's a mass murderer!?
[3:20:35] <DesuDesuDokiDoki> paige is mad
[3:20:39] <dekkitout> so we talkin chaotic evil, or randy evil 🤔
[3:20:39] <Zaxshimysham> you can just tap it once to hit them
[3:20:39] <%mothmanfanboy> Pat, you only have to tag them once
[3:20:39] <%Puppet88> just get them once pat, no need to hold
[3:20:39] <%TheMilhouseExperience> He really is a bad person.
[3:20:39] <@PlagueOfGripes> the worst evil, fictional evil
[3:20:40] <xeros720> it bugs me that the sleep effect alerts them
[3:20:40] <SirSmudgey> ITS ON A TIMER
[3:20:41] <%ElenaManetta> Nothing wrong with haunting someone's dreams, dreams aren't real.
[3:20:43] <Corporate_Redeemer> This is reboot Freddy so he's also a child diddler
[3:20:44] <Run44forrest> freddy: give me your Phone
[3:20:46] <The_Blumper> I find it hard to beleive a killer can be evil;
[3:20:46] <%topendbuzz> did you know a killer, killed?
[3:20:47] <KeystoneA1> Relax your booty Paige.
[3:20:50] <ShadowAssassin525> mhjgk
[3:20:50] <+universboy95> It's only 2 seconds you have to hold on
[3:20:50] <%Fruitywhompus> yeah no shit she was mad
[3:20:51] <Laecerelius> Vauban needs to sacrifice some of his friends to the altar of Pedro in order to get a decent rework
[3:20:51] <+Lokieda> you dont need to hold it
[3:20:53] <pennykettle_> Remember when there was a news story calling out Portal 2 for having a villain that makes fun of being adopted
[3:20:54] <%ThePuddingDead> u sleep her
[3:20:58] <+Nomicro4u> Pet Elmo for us
[3:20:59] <Coystick> Fictional evil is literally hilter
[3:20:59] <$FrostMass22> I'd rather he murder children than molest them.
[3:20:59] <DedlokPM> @PeachSaliva you don't have to hold it on them. You just need to hit them with it once and then after a bit they go to sleep.
[3:21:00] <@StridentSong> You don't have to hold the sleep thing. You just have to hit them with it and they get pulled in after 3s econds
[3:21:00] <DesuDesuDokiDoki> mad ' ^ '
[3:21:04] <SirSmudgey> YOU DONT HAVE THE HOLD THE POWER
[3:21:06] <+TempestaDePrimo> The guy from My Bloody Valentine as a killer
[3:21:07] <%wizkid50000> Please tell Pat he doesnt have to holf it
[3:21:07] <$AgentTexes> @PeachSaliva You don't have to hold on. Once the sound que happens you can let go. It's how you can sleep multiple people at the same time
[3:21:07] <mercado94> sing a lullaby into their ear
[3:21:12] <ShadowSketches> Pat you dont have to hold it, you can just click them once
[3:21:14] <+Smashking91> She ain't asleep
[3:21:16] <Idon__> ring around the rosie
[3:21:17] <$ooblagis> Does he even have any strengths beyond some stealth?
[3:21:17] <MadSkulll> you dont have to hold it
[3:21:18] <%SaltyDongs> juked
[3:21:19] <FunkyStreams> seems pretty fast tho
[3:21:21] <%Dotta5> Paige, planning on a Twitch sings stream at all?
[3:21:22] <alwayspronking> You don't have to hold it, just the initial is fine
[3:21:24] <KeystoneA1> The remake would've been better if Freddy wasn't an evil pedophile in life, but turned into a monster because the kids lied about him.
[3:21:25] <rockworm> the worst part about freddy is that survivors can just fail a skill check and get out of the dream world right away
[3:21:26] <benjiFG> the bass in the track when you chase them slaps
[3:21:30] <@PlagueOfGripes> he's a normal killer with one extra step
[3:21:30] <troxcree> If only Jason didn't have so many legal hang ups for no reason.
[3:21:31] <Stratrat> there has to be like are cooldowns increased in the dreamstate for the survivers?
[3:21:32] <%AncelDeLambert> yeah, either sleep should be instanteneous, or Freddy should have a non-existent cooldown to his attack
[3:21:34] <+Smashking91> Also always lunge
[3:21:36] <$SleepyMaribo> Hey @PeachSaliva i had a round where i managed to hook and kill all 4 survivors because i managed to catch all of them in beartraps.
[3:21:37] <krymzen5> they shouldn't be able to do anything in the dream
[3:21:38] <%ElenaManetta> Those teens need to be taught that unprotected teenage sex is bad SOMEHOW
[3:21:38] <LiquidMathew> like its neat that you don't have to worry about being spotted, but otherwise
[3:21:44] <%galaxyswirl> honestly all he needs is an increase in his move speed to make him alot better
[3:21:46] <%salty_syd913> at least you only have to pull them into the dream once
[3:21:46] <+Haarute> There's a sick bassline I keep hearing.
[3:21:48] <sniper_masa> With no addon, 7 seconds to fall asleep.
[3:21:51] <sparrrow_> Huntress cum eh
[3:21:55] <%ThePuddingDead> oh like babayaga?
[3:21:55] <@PlagueOfGripes> wish I could turn it off.
[3:21:57] <SeventyForce> Little bunny~
[3:21:59] <ShadowSketches> Freddy has the benefits of slowing down their action speed, being invisible, and letting you see survivors that are asleep and out of your terror radius
[3:21:59] <+Grayhammatter> wow, what a waste of that decisive strike
[3:22:00] <FunkyStreams> maybe increase the range of his sleepy time ability
[3:22:01] <Valdorick> Freddy - a Pedo. Also Freddy - Kills teens that have sex.
[3:22:02] <+Ace9817> Didn't freddie cut off someone's dick in one of the movies?
[3:22:02] <+Doctor_Stew> can freddy camp spikes and prevent people from pulling off of spikes by pulling them into the dream?
[3:22:03] <randomp141> I whined at pat to pick huntress, but he wouldn't.
[3:22:03] <bayowolfterra> the one thing i guess is hes invisible, and with howvtuis game works thats hardly an advantage.
[3:22:06] <Fujiwara_92> PLAY HUNTRESS
[3:22:07] <SirSmudgey> You don't need to hold Freddy's power, it only requires 1 tap
[3:22:09] <%nofestu2> It's called bayushki bayu
[3:22:09] <Corporate_Redeemer> They wake themselves up by failing skillchecks. HE has add-ons to shorten the sleep transition and reduce skillchecks
[3:22:10] <$FrostMass22> I hate the character so much, every Huntress camps like a bitch
[3:22:17] <tacostarvedbeast> I like how the killers are polite enough to close the lockers they open
[3:22:21] <FunkyStreams> that would be OP af
[3:22:25] <Idon__> LMAO
[3:22:26] <%Keyd00d> PALETTE
[3:22:27] <$ooblagis> It's MR. X!
[3:22:27] <$Sphincter_Spelunker> ring around the rosie
[3:22:28] <Idon__> THIS IS DUMB
[3:22:28] <ipwnlocks> freddy is fine with class photo addon
[3:22:36] <DesuDesuDokiDoki> *sigh*
[3:22:38] <Idon__> truly, a deadly killer
[3:22:39] <deviljhojho94> Freddie doesnt feel so good
[3:22:39] <DedlokPM> @PeachSaliva you don't have to hold it on them. You just need to click on them with it once and then after a bit they go to sleep.
[3:22:44] <%ElenaManetta> don't sigh pat you're being a FUCKING ASSHOLE!!!!!!!!!
[3:22:49] <%king_wragles> Freddy SOUNDS fun, but doesn't look fun
[3:22:49] <$Agami23> why can they drop dream pallets?
[3:22:49] <DesuDesuDokiDoki> URGH
[3:22:49] <Fujiwara_92> Freddy is dumb
[3:22:53] <%galaxyswirl> everyone does
[3:22:55] <$FrostMass22> Behold: a Paleblood sky!
[3:22:56] <OwlLightningMage> Freddy also sucks pig ass LUL
[3:22:58] <Corporate_Redeemer> The problem is that the devs are all survivor mains so they are Super biased against killers
[3:22:58] <Luesagna00> @peachsaliva this is super weird. freddy like is this dream lord being. so its rly off him just running around chasing ppl down.
[3:22:58] <Coystick> If you fail that's TOXIC
[3:22:59] <zettig> What's to stop the killer from just camping a hooked survivor until they die?
[3:23:01] <xeros720> they need to give him more of his movie abilities, like teleporting or stretchy arms
[3:23:02] <JDebss> This is a super disappointing Freddy
[3:23:03] <@PlagueOfGripes> killers enjoy pallets as much as survivors enjoy being forced to use them
[3:23:04] <+VanaSkiller> @randomp141 call him a pedo lover too, maybe then you'll get his attention LUL
[3:23:04] <BrachyZoid> It's ok. His mechanics are absurd
[3:23:05] <rockworm> Pat's already doing better than I did my first time with Freddy
[3:23:10] <%Remery_> wish he called people bitch
[3:23:11] <Mopopolis> The classic 360
[3:23:13] <%ThePuddingDead> thats 2
[3:23:18] <Yummy_Nukes> TICKLE HANDS
[3:23:19] <+CaptainObnoxious> watching it i feel like his attack should be given less of a pause after his attack since he can only attack in the dream state
[3:23:19] <%TheMilhouseExperience> Just put everyone to sleep.
[3:23:20] <$SleepyMaribo> Freddy is the least played killer.
[3:23:22] <%AncelDeLambert> they get negative points for camping
[3:23:25] <ipwnlocks> freddy cant camp, lmao
[3:23:25] <@StridentSong> If you camp, you get VERY few points
[3:23:25] <Mopopolis> Nope
[3:23:27] <bayowolfterra> theyre trying to juke your camera.
[3:23:28] <%Puppet88> no you dont pat
[3:23:29] <SirSmudgey> NO YOU DONT
[3:23:29] <ShadowSketches> No pat you dont have to hold it
[3:23:30] <%Puppet88> BIG WRONG
[3:23:31] <Hmmmm_Nice_Bike> freddy should just make them listen to his album
[3:23:32] <Smaenus> Freddy is a bad man but the sweater fashion is neat
[3:23:32] <MadSkulll> NO YOU DONT
[3:23:32] <$FrostMass22> It's also kind of stupid, imo
[3:23:35] <randomp141> @VanaSkiller What? wasn't paying attention to the chat?
[3:23:35] <MadSkulll> 1
[3:23:36] <+Demerson13> You don't have to hold
[3:23:36] <NumbusPlays> Nah, you can click but holding it puts them asleep faster
[3:23:37] <ShadowSketches> you click them once then wait about 8 seconds for them to sleep
[3:23:37] <%mothmanfanboy> NO PAT, IT'S ON A TIMER BEFORE THEY FALL ASLEEP
[3:23:39] <Mopopolis> Pat, try not holding it and see what happenes good sir
[3:23:40] <+TempestaDePrimo> Why does everyone run like that?
[3:23:41] <+ItsNineTen> 11111
[3:23:41] <+meatwhole> no you don't there is a transition time to sleep @PeachSaliva
[3:23:43] <$graffitisamurai> 1
[3:23:44] <@PlagueOfGripes> nothing actually. you can immediately fuck up someone's game at the cost of your own
[3:23:45] <+Ninestempest> 1
[3:23:46] <Corporate_Redeemer> NO YOU DON'T. IT JUST TAKES 7 SECONDS FOR THEM TO FALL ASLEEP
[3:23:47] <LtThunderbolt> giving nightmares like Wes Crave
[3:23:47] <SirSmudgey> YOU DONT NEED TO HOLD THE POWER ITS ON A TIMER
[3:23:47] <%ElenaManetta> If you max out your skill tree, what's the incentive then?
[3:23:49] <ANoNameIs> You should always camp the hook when the doors are open though
[3:23:50] <+Ace9817> I love his goofy finger wiggle.
[3:23:52] <%Puppet88> it just takes a few seconds for survivors to fall asleep after using your power on them
[3:23:56] <DedlokPM> @PeachSaliva YOU ABSOULTELY DO NOT NEED TO HOLD IT! ONCE YOU HEAR THE LAUGH THEY START FALLING TO SLEEP
[3:23:56] <$AgentTexes> @PeachSaliva Once that little light comes out of his hand they will go to sleep in a few seconds
[3:24:02] <%AncelDeLambert> that's WAY too long
[3:24:03] <$kinghats> that finger wiggle seams to eat time
[3:24:06] <Yummy_Nukes> TICKLE TICKLE
[3:24:09] <+TempestaDePrimo> 7 Seconds have passed
[3:24:10] <+TheArrow_> wish he didn't have to wiggle his fingers after every hit
[3:24:10] <$kinghats> seems*
[3:24:21] <Luesagna00> @peachsaliva why does points matter? u win the game tho if ya camp
[3:24:25] <DesuDesuDokiDoki> wiggley boi
[3:24:25] <BrachyZoid> It also gives them quite the personality
[3:24:27] <$Sphincter_Spelunker> This stream is too chill now. I need Paige's "relaxing" play
[3:24:28] <+HypestMoose> Apparently they wanna rework him
[3:24:33] <%ElenaManetta> Pat wiggles his dick
[3:24:37] <+Ace9817> Gotta loosen up his fingers, can't have them cramping up.
[3:24:37] <@PlagueOfGripes> plus you can't customize him, so who carea
[3:24:39] <%ThatGuyfromMars> @Luesagna00 you can't level up without points
[3:24:40] <DedlokPM> @king_wragles All killers have a little animation after a hit. It's so they can't double hit quickly
[3:24:42] <Run44forrest> time stop would be too OP huh?
[3:24:43] <bayowolfterra> @luesagna00 more upgrade points
[3:24:44] <tacostarvedbeast> Do they go to sleep faster if you hold the sleep juice?
[3:24:46] <%king_wragles> Lesion is a great staff in Warframe btw
[3:24:47] <rockworm> you do not win if you camp. This game punishes you hard for camping
[3:24:53] <FunkyStreams> yes, paige
[3:25:01] <+Skeletorexplains> Welcome to your nightmare. bitch
[3:25:02] <OwlLightningMage> Zarya is being added to Warframe LUL
[3:25:06] <DedlokPM> @tacostarvedbeast holding on them does nothing as far as I know
[3:25:10] <%AncelDeLambert> why is your foot not loading in?
[3:25:19] <$kinghats> why isnt freddy doing goofy nightmare shenanigans? its seems like theres a ton missing with his kit
[3:25:20] <%ThatGuyfromMars> now you're playing with power!
[3:25:21] <+Ace9817> I wanna see some sick combos with Freddie going Vega on survivors.
[3:25:22] <Clammy_chan> Who's your fave survivor btw?
[3:25:22] <Mopopolis> That's why machine gun builds were popular before for killers like Hag, since her mobility was trash when she came out
[3:25:24] <%galaxyswirl> it doesnt make since why pallets work on freddy
[3:25:25] <+TempestaDePrimo> @OwlLightningMage Zarya is best girl
[3:25:25] <ShadowSketches> His foot isnt in the dream world
[3:25:25] <@PlagueOfGripes> killers do win every time, just by degrees
[3:25:25] <pennykettle_> So this game seems to have a lot of roleplay in a way
[3:25:26] <%ThePuddingDead> how dare they pitch a fit at a killer
[3:25:27] <%ElenaManetta> NO GAMEPLAY SHAMING THO
[3:25:28] <%ThePuddingDead> ha rumph
[3:25:29] <BrachyZoid> Completely justified rage
[3:25:31] <energywarning> post game chat postman pat
[3:25:32] <%Keyd00d> I don't care if players hate me for playing hte game
[3:25:34] <Yummy_Nukes> TICKLE TICKLE
[3:25:37] <SUPEROBNOXIOUSALLCAPSNAME> I only camp snarky survivors that drop too many pallets and taunt me by doing stupid shit
[3:25:39] <Idon__> they're too uncowardly
[3:25:42] <OwlLightningMage> @TempestaDePrimo She's pretty cool
[3:25:42] <haisho> dont forget matchup unfamiliarity
[3:25:46] <Corporate_Redeemer> There used to be a "Machine Gun" build with a certain perk that made the cooldown time on killer hits to be 1 second long.
[3:25:49] <$FrostMass22> But camping is playing less of the game
[3:25:50] <lizard0tm> Seems like they're toying with you
[3:25:52] <try_it_sis_> sis had some vibrato
[3:25:54] <+Nomicro4u> That guys neck looks broken
[3:25:56] <bayowolfterra> id say its a loss for killer if everyone escapes, but otherwise yeah.
[3:25:57] <dekkitout> cant wait to min max the living hell out of my shields when zarya gets added
[3:25:59] <$AgentTexes> @PeachSaliva Pat if you wanna get better at the game you can watch a dude named Scott Jund play it. He also has a lot of tutorial videos for every killer.
[3:26:01] <%ElenaManetta> What about Pat's classic catchphrase in life where, "It's not cheap if I win the game"
[3:26:09] <%Fruitywhompus> Hbomb beat DK64 !!!!
[3:26:09] <mercado94> but what if my goal is piss off players
[3:26:12] <Idon__> byyyye
[3:26:13] <%AncelDeLambert> it's not playing the game. The point is to hook survivors, the point is NOT to succesfully sacrifice
[3:26:14] <Valdorick> Womp womp
[3:26:17] <+TheArrow_> oh wow
[3:26:19] <%druvirus> then you're an ass
[3:26:20] <Corporate_Redeemer> Asleep survivors shouldn't be able to escape
[3:26:21] <sparrrow_> poor Fweddie Kappa
[3:26:22] <+Ace9817> Yeah that... oof.
[3:26:23] <%ThePuddingDead> yeah thats ass
[3:26:24] <@PlagueOfGripes> I liked this guy called... html something
[3:26:25] <+PenmanLupine> @kinghats cause this isn't a Freddy Krueger game. The mechanics need to stay generic enough for multiple killers instead of focusing on 1 being able to do everything.
[3:26:26] <+Grayhammatter> oof
[3:26:28] <Luesagna00> but why even gain upgrades? to win the game could just camp.
[3:26:29] <Fujiwara_92> that's trash
[3:26:30] <Idon__> Freddy's too nice
[3:26:31] <LiquidMathew> 3 seconds maybe
[3:26:32] <zettig> Thanks everyone for the explanation.
[3:26:32] <$rdark_ksu> whos talking
[3:26:33] <%salty_syd913> possibly 3
[3:26:34] <sparrrow_> or instant
[3:26:35] <ShadowSketches> Freddy is very weak at the end stages, all his strenghts come from slowing down the game so it never gets to the end stage
[3:26:35] <ShichiNoBushi> Seems like camping is hardly even playing the game.
[3:26:36] <Idon__> byyyyyye
[3:26:37] <xeros720> hmm, maybe a stacking debuff that makes them easier to sleep the more times you sleep them?
[3:26:38] <+DuurHuur> My question is, what's the benefit of putting them to sleep? How does it make you stronger other than "I'm invisible"
[3:26:38] <haisho> he needs to ramp up in power as the game goes
[3:26:39] <DesuDesuDokiDoki> didnt paige win a Chicken Dinner by Camping LUL
[3:26:40] <OwlLightningMage> 30 seconds Kappa
[3:26:40] <+Demerson13> The game kind of breaks itself when you run NOED w/ mori as a killer
[3:26:41] <Idon__> lmao
[3:26:41] <%Spydurman> Dream world would be fine if those outside it couldn't save their buddies
[3:26:42] <sdbzdb> yeah make freddy like the pig
[3:26:43] <%ThePuddingDead> wow
[3:26:43] <%Keyd00d> TOXIC
[3:26:44] <%Spydurman> LUL
[3:26:45] <rockworm> whenever survivors are hanging out in the exit knowing they'll win no matter what you do... that is the worst feeling playing this game
[3:26:45] <krymzen5> oof
[3:26:45] <+Ace9817> WOOOOOW that's some BM
[3:26:46] <Tisaric> wow freddy is shit
[3:26:46] <+Grayhammatter> wow
[3:26:48] <+Bloodxb> it's too fair
[3:26:49] <Mopopolis> TAXIC
[3:26:50] <$AgentTexes> jundLUL
[3:26:51] <KeystoneA1> The disrespect
[3:26:51] <+mimikyu92> Thats impolite
[3:26:51] <$SleepyMaribo> i hate when killers camp
[3:26:52] <%SaltyDongs> fuck you
[3:26:52] <FunkyStreams> I mean fuck you cant even see freddy less youre asleep so just make him invisible till he chooses to use his ability
[3:26:53] <$Sphincter_Spelunker> ResidentSleeper
[3:26:54] <+PenmanLupine> lol. thats why Freddy is shit
[3:26:55] <benjiFG> social link with entity go down
[3:26:55] <JDebss> This really feels like you're only playing Freddy's glove and not the character.
[3:26:55] <+Gooniekorn> BM LUL
[3:26:56] <OwlLightningMage> Nerf Freddy Kappa
[3:26:56] <eco419> boooooo
[3:26:57] <BrachyZoid> It is a difficult killer
[3:26:57] <Hmmmm_Nice_Bike> freddy looked so sad
[3:26:58] <%absolute_weapon> Well. Sorry it went so bad. But thanks for doing it
[3:26:58] <Youknowwhyimhere008> 😡 toxic
[3:26:58] <nomad480> toxic teabagging
[3:26:58] <JackalKing> Camping isn't even the optimal way to play. People shit on people for doing it because its only purpose is to negatively impact the survivor you hooked. The killer gets more points by not camping. So a killer that camps is actively choosing to sacrifice points to give the other players a harder time
[3:26:58] <%king_wragles> I feel like Freddy could get a lot of use from a post wiggle melee boost
[3:26:58] <Fujiwara_92> TOXIC
[3:27:02] <Corporate_Redeemer> YOU TRIED
[3:27:02] <%SWFanatic> gg
[3:27:03] <ThirdWelles> "I wanna win, even if winning involves standing in one place for ten minutes"
[3:27:03] <+Skeletorexplains> Was that the same guy from last game?
[3:27:04] <%AncelDeLambert> okay, yeah, not bothering with Freddie
[3:27:06] <+TempestaDePrimo> They should add Thriller Michael Jackson
[3:27:07] <+shady520> Should not be able to leave in the dream state
[3:27:08] <+Yodifest> so how do u win
[3:27:10] <%king_wragles> and shorten that debuff timer
[3:27:11] <%Remery_> Freddy is like Pat height
[3:27:12] <Iam_Dead> why does Freddy even get stopped by palettes?
[3:27:15] <@PlagueOfGripes> No one had fun! the normal outcome!
[3:27:15] <tacostarvedbeast> Pat doesn’t like the invisible character?
[3:27:18] <Yummy_Nukes> gg pat you did gud big murder
[3:27:20] <+MisterCrimson> It sounds like Michael is more boring to play than bad
[3:27:20] <%ElenaManetta> Camping is a failure of the game designer.
[3:27:20] <ANoNameIs> @JackalKing You should camp a hooked survivor if the gates are open
[3:27:22] <+Story_Ark> man how disappointing, imo the best horror character ever and he aint even cool
[3:27:23] <undeadsamurai222> its crazy how backwards the ps4 version
[3:27:24] <randomp141> Ya, Freddy needs an instant dream state or players don't realize he hit them with the dream thing.
[3:27:25] <shlaggori> why isnt the byebye man int this game?
[3:27:25] <$SleepyMaribo> you weat them down
[3:27:26] <suikudo> looks cool but also looks like it plays like shit
[3:27:27] <DesuDesuDokiDoki> by killing
[3:27:27] <JDebss> by killing
[3:27:28] <$FrostMass22> @iam_dead Gameplay contrivance
[3:27:29] <ZeeJiggle> Way I see it, sometimes your only option is to camp, like if it's end game and gates are open. What else are you s'posed to do, y'know?
[3:27:29] <$SleepyMaribo> *wear
[3:27:30] <SUPEROBNOXIOUSALLCAPSNAME> you win by gettings pips, thats the only thing that matters
[3:27:32] <bayowolfterra> i think the tbagger was having fun...
[3:27:33] <sdbzdb> play the huntress thats always fun
[3:27:34] <%TheMilhouseExperience> Yeah freddy needs a rework.
[3:27:35] <$FrostMass22> Kill everyone
[3:27:35] <+ahegotrigger> yeah you shouldnt be able to leave while in dream world
[3:27:37] <SirSmudgey> You win by killing, this isn't rocket science
[3:27:37] <raypoint_223> If I get camped I get satisfaction knowing that i'm keeping killer busy.
[3:27:37] <BrachyZoid> No one plays games to have fun
[3:27:37] <WeedSpagon> What if we created a 5 player survival game in which 1 person plays as a monster hunting 4 survivors and the goal of the survivors is to escape. You could even call it Murdered by Moonlight.
[3:27:39] <%ThePuddingDead> so I take it all the extra killers are paid dlc then?
[3:27:39] <+Demerson13> This game has so much potential, I wish they'd develop the ideas more.
[3:27:42] <+ahegotrigger> just like with the pigs traps
[3:27:43] <Corporate_Redeemer> Freddy is so short that you don't even see his feet as he breaks pallets, NO JOKE
[3:27:43] <Yummy_Nukes> GOTTA KILL 'EM ALL
[3:27:43] <Coystick> PAIGE HURRY
[3:27:45] <DedlokPM> Like if you are not asleep you can save people for free because not only can freddy not hit you but they can't hit the person being unhooked either because they are awakened when you put them on the hook
[3:27:47] <ThirdWelles> "video games is about winning! Winning is how I have fun! That's why I only box with people 50lbs lighter than me!"
[3:27:47] <+Ace9817> I agree with Plague though, about "Degrees of winning"
[3:27:49] <changtasia> that lap pad is so dirty....
[3:27:57] <JackalKing> @ANoNameIs Well yes. As with any rules, there are exceptions
[3:27:59] <JDebss> some people care more about winning than points
[3:27:59] <Luesagna00> @peachsaliva leveling doesnt sound like a good incentive tho. "you played the role well even tho ya lost the game" like da fuck?
[3:28:04] <tacostarvedbeast> Kill them all peter
[3:28:06] <dekkitout> murder by moonlight actually sounds like a good name
[3:28:08] <$Sphincter_Spelunker> A design of dirt
[3:28:09] <%Keyd00d> GRIME
[3:28:10] <$kinghats> @PenmanLupine well I mean pulling someone into a dream seems to mean nothing other than "now you can see me and I can hit you" obscenely generic to me. Nothing about his kit says "Freddy" and not just a sandman kind of thing
[3:28:10] <+walternatorz> dirty roses
[3:28:11] <FunkyStreams> thought it was mustard stains
[3:28:11] <+Nomicro4u> Dirt Design
[3:28:12] <DesuDesuDokiDoki> filthy roses
[3:28:13] <energywarning> as she does
[3:28:13] <Coystick> It's filthy
[3:28:14] <+Grayhammatter> that's ROSES?
[3:28:14] <%NWR_James> FILTHY
[3:28:15] <LiquidMathew> The point is to try to be like the movies, excting not lame!
[3:28:15] <+MisterCrimson> roses...painted with ketchup
[3:28:17] <%ElenaManetta> That's her natural grease.
[3:28:20] <nomad480> filthy mustard roses
[3:28:21] <%galaxyswirl> @PeachSaliva so what changes did they make with the wraith? cause i mained him before his update so i dont know what they changed
[3:28:21] <bsmusic> LUL
[3:28:22] <$iwasJase> roses are disgusting
[3:28:22] <%jiin6> Mustard go Everywhere
[3:28:23] <Fujiwara_92> filthy roses
[3:28:24] <eco419> cummies daddy
[3:28:25] <+Ace9817> Wait mustard right on the pad..?
[3:28:28] <Enemy_In_Disguise> The killer is the GM
[3:28:29] <BigNerdSam> R U S T I C L A P P A D
[3:28:30] <Rivalshotzgp> Didn’t they say 2 deaths 2 escaped is effectively a tie
[3:28:32] <SUPEROBNOXIOUSALLCAPSNAME> There's a ranked system, you get pips which increase your rank
[3:28:35] <Valdorick> Plague just hates how inaccurate the game is. He's very experienced in random people being inside his fence and never leaving again.
[3:28:36] <dekkitout> blud web sounds 90's comics as hell
[3:28:36] <@StridentSong> One of the changes with Wraith are he starts in steath mode
[3:28:36] <OwlLightningMage> Revenant needs a rework because he is boring
[3:28:38] <ShadowSketches> DBD is all about progression
[3:28:40] <@PlagueOfGripes> the game just needs smaller in game goals other than points
[3:28:43] <tacostarvedbeast> I bet it smells like WcDonalds
[3:28:43] <Yummy_Nukes> oh paige you silly mustard girl
[3:28:44] <$SleepyMaribo> i like that items are oen game use
[3:28:44] <Iam_Dead> @frostmass22 no I know why, it's just he should be rewarded for pulling into dream state, and a good reward would be ignoring collision on palettes
[3:28:44] <FunkyStreams> better than strait out of the bottle I guess
[3:28:50] <ShichiNoBushi> Paige just sacrificed a small creature to Elmo.
[3:28:52] <%ThePuddingDead> whats The Doctor do?
[3:28:55] <%Remery_> his in n out of stealth is more fluid
[3:28:55] <%jiin6> people like numbers
[3:28:56] <%ElenaManetta> I have fun PISSSSS COMING OUT MY ASSSSSS
[3:28:56] <FunkyStreams> straight*
[3:28:58] <+Story_Ark> i dont like how shit it is on ps4 :(
[3:29:01] <satyr_king> STOP HAVING FUN
[3:29:02] <FunkyStreams> gettin late
[3:29:04] <+VanaSkiller> crying
[3:29:07] <Luesagna00> @peachsaliva no i mean leveling as the killer. like play to win OR gain points?
[3:29:07] <bayowolfterra> ooh, another game mode would be very nice.
[3:29:07] <%king_wragles> Okay, so here's my take on Freddy: he needs a melee boost that's triggered from the wiggle OR survivors have to go into the dream state to unhook their friends. Not a perfect solution but a decent on imo
[3:29:10] <$MajorCrasher> The main reason not to camp is that good survivors will get all the generators done while you're doing nothing
[3:29:13] <lupus_man> GIVE THANK
[3:29:14] <$Sphincter_Spelunker> Gamers Rise Up
[3:29:14] <Yummy_Nukes> NO FUN ALLOWED
[3:29:17] <haisho> Play Subnautica and shit your pants at the Reaper Leviathans already
[3:29:19] <+PenmanLupine> @kinghats yeah but your wondering why he's not doing his Nightmare on Elm Street stuff. I told you why.
[3:29:20] <DesuDesuDokiDoki> she luvs it
[3:29:20] <KeystoneA1> PUBG was a broken piece of shit anyway.
[3:29:24] <%Keyd00d> I'm cool just watching
[3:29:30] <Corporate_Redeemer> Myers with a Scratched Mirror add-on is super scary to play against because he has 0 terror radius
[3:29:30] <+Ace9817> Have you guys seen/played Hunt: Showdown?
[3:29:33] <+takakunai> it's so amazing
[3:29:33] <ShadowSketches> Paige why dont you use sprint burst
[3:29:35] <+D_day> Subnatica PogChamp
[3:29:36] <+MisterCrimson> Expanding the Dong for Trans Rights
[3:29:37] <%blazymaniac> he slept for a little while last night
[3:29:37] <Shastafield> he finished
[3:29:38] <FunkyStreams> NO THANK ALLOWED
[3:29:41] <+meatwhole> Yeah he just sleeps and puts a skeleton up to entertain stream @PeachSaliva
[3:29:43] <%galaxyswirl> so they didnt really do anything to really make wraith better, depressing
[3:29:44] <The_Blumper> Whats hbomberguy doing?
[3:29:45] <%Fruitywhompus> Hbomb just finished it !!!
[3:29:46] <Zeemod155> He's slept... it's the 57th hour
[3:29:46] <%ElenaManetta> Someone can live with pulling one all nighter it's finnnneeee
[3:29:46] <%jiin6> for a guy who loves ds2, he's doing ok
[3:29:49] <$FrostMass22> He's doing it to himself.
[3:29:49] <lupus_man> NO thank
[3:29:50] <tacostarvedbeast> H bomber guy?
[3:29:52] <a_mad_dragon> he's going to become Hsleeperguy
[3:29:53] <CLOUDSOFF> wtf are you feeding that cat, its huge!
[3:29:54] <+Barrel_l0l> the main reason I dislike this game is you cant level your blood web in private matches, meaning if me and my friends wanted a normal experience in private matches we'd have to grind normal matches for consumables that will be lost in the private matches
[3:29:55] <suikudo> Arin from game grumps did a 26 hour stream and beat all of the first KH
[3:29:56] <WeedSpagon> What about a third/first person open world zombie survival game with light crafting elements and PvP. You could call it NightS.
[3:29:57] <Kemmybelle> He's done.
[3:29:58] <raypoint_223> S paige is a meg main?
[3:29:58] <ShadowSketches> Sprint burst is my favorite Meg perk
[3:29:59] <+Skeletorexplains> me
[3:29:59] <$ooblagis> It's illegal
[3:29:59] <%ElenaManetta> IT'S AGAINST THE LAW.
[3:30:03] <+TempestaDePrimo> Spin the wheel.
[3:30:03] <ipwnlocks> MORI
[3:30:03] <%Raxus_Secundus> Did he borrow Skelmo?
[3:30:10] <NumbusPlays> wasn't pat leaving? LUL
[3:30:10] <%king_wragles> @PeachSaliva as long as he gives the skeleton his cut, it should be fine.
[3:30:12] <ShichiNoBushi> A good game is not one that guarantees you will win. It needs to create a tension and a possibility that you will lose.
[3:30:13] <%jiin6> 24 hr stream AND HE SLEEPS
[3:30:13] <floatRand> I am big pussy and start feeling like quitter at 12 hours of being awake.
[3:30:17] <DesuDesuDokiDoki> whos mori?
[3:30:17] <Corporate_Redeemer> M O R T I S
[3:30:19] <SirSmudgey> Gee I wonder who's gonna get mori'd

[3:30:23] <+Story_Ark> i really hope they patch the ps4 version, i got it for ps+ but it runs awful
[3:30:25] <floatRand> Doesn't really help that I didn't sleep tonight.
[3:30:27] <$SleepyMaribo> @PeachSaliva Wraith best killer.
[3:30:28] <+Demerson13> Mori with NOED, the ultimate fair combo.

[3:30:31] <ipwnlocks> get mori'ed paige plz
[3:30:33] <%ThePuddingDead> So can you unlock all the killers just by playing or by paying only?
[3:30:33] <+The48thCrow> Oh so all Skeletons are related?

[3:30:40] <%jiin6> British Skelmo
[3:30:42] <%TheMilhouseExperience> Mori is an offering that does a buff. I think.
[3:30:42] <+TempestaDePrimo> "Skelmo's calcium depraved cousin"
[3:30:46] <tacostarvedbeast> I bet bitch Ricky gave him the idea to use a skeleton
[3:30:46] <raypoint_223> Love you grandpa bill!
[3:30:47] <FunkyStreams> wouldnt be surprised if Paige actually owned that sweater irl
[3:30:47] <%jiin6> the Baby
[3:30:47] <%NWR_James> So did he sleep at some point?
[3:30:48] <Corporate_Redeemer> Moris let the killer outright kill downed players
[3:30:48] <+CaptainObnoxious> is that bill from left 4 dead?
[3:30:57] <bayowolfterra> @thepuddingdead all but the movie killers.
[3:30:58] <+D_day> PILLS HERE
[3:30:59] <DedlokPM> @ThePuddingDead Surivors in his terror radius build up madness. At max level madness they will scream randomly and seeing illusions of you standing and fake pallets. He has 2 attack stances, one that lets you charge up a shock that increases madness
[3:30:59] <+Skeletorexplains> 420 stream, nice
[3:30:59] <Yummy_Nukes> EMLO!
[3:30:59] <Maleicus> bill it is
[3:31:00] <sdbzdb> yeah bill is pc only
[3:31:05] <%ThatGuyfromMars> BTW Pat, on Friday it'll be five years since you received that Steve Buscemi portrait from the Mailbag
[3:31:06] <sodium_station> Man it's wild seeing Bill again, L4D2 was freaking 9 years ago
[3:31:07] <giga_bit> @ThePuddingDead Movie tie in characters only accept real cash, and getting the rest would take ages of playtime
[3:31:13] <+Story_Ark> how do you get a mori?
[3:31:14] <satyr_king> BILL!
[3:31:15] <%Remery_> The killer get a Fatality
[3:31:19] <randomp141> Freddies sleep state shouldn't alert players at all.
[3:31:21] <Corporate_Redeemer> Myers can kill you without downing

[3:31:41] <BrachyZoid> Go Paige, GO!!
[3:31:41] <@PlagueOfGripes> I think it has a lot of base design problems. a lot of the more famous killer players seem to be entitled children that whine about survivors trying to defend themselves. when they could be breaking down the design foibles, so nothing gets done

[3:32:37] <%AncelDeLambert> so, thanks to that dumbass for showing teh killer where you were
[3:32:38] <Mopopolis> 360 spin to win is the go to tactic
[3:32:39] <faegbeard> It's actually BAD to do.
[3:32:43] <@PlagueOfGripes> wiggle! so useful!
[3:32:49] <Corporate_Redeemer> Killers get a small amount of auto-aim
[3:32:49] <sdbzdb> wiggle rarly gets you out
[3:32:50] <%ElenaManetta> Is that the Jaws music?
[3:32:51] <$SleepyMaribo> Attempt Escape never fucking works
[3:32:57] <%ElenaManetta> IS the killer a shark?

[3:33:07] <@PlagueOfGripes> they nerfed that anyway
[3:33:07] <faegbeard> 360 spin = win. Serpentine = death.
[3:33:11] <%ThatGuyfromMars> YO Jaws should be the next killer
[3:33:12] <%Remery_> i think that Kate girl has a perk to improve your wiggling
[3:33:13] <@StridentSong> Hell yea
[3:33:20] <@PlagueOfGripes> you cant even really do it anymore
[3:33:24] <randomp141> @PeachSaliva Strident says yes
[3:33:26] <ShadowSketches> 360 only works if the killer is dumb tbh

[3:35:29] <Corporate_Redeemer> Sabotaging hooks used to permanently break those hooks, so there would be matches with literally the only hooks remaining being the ones in the basement

[3:36:06] <%SWFanatic> sipsipElmo sipsipElmo sipsipElmo
[3:36:06] <FunkyStreams> using a V8 engine as a generator is almost unheard of. Normally its a straight configuration for reliability reasons. this game sucks.
[3:36:06] <%AncelDeLambert> were there candles
[3:36:07] <krymzen5> no idea
[3:36:07] <JeedyJay> Just got back from the end of hbomberguy's stream. The DK64 ending almost drove him insane.
[3:36:07] <+Skeletorexplains> what totem do

[3:36:17] <DuoScratch> Cleanse Dulls to stop NOED @PeachSaliva
[3:36:20] <Yummy_Nukes> Elmo!
[3:36:20] <ShadowSketches> totems are used with certain perks
[3:36:20] <%ElenaManetta> WOW
[3:36:21] <Corporate_Redeemer> TRAP ROOM
[3:36:22] <%ElenaManetta> what a twist
[3:36:23] <bayowolfterra> i do wosh the hiding mechanics were more emphasis on stealth, though i understand the complications Involved
[3:36:25] <+TempestaDePrimo> I didn't even realize the generators were v8s
[3:36:26] <%ThePuddingDead> pretty simple
[3:36:26] <dekkitout> thats what a trapper does? wild
[3:36:27] <%Keyd00d> I love traps
[3:36:27] <+Grayhammatter> AH!
[3:36:29] <+Nomicro4u> He dresses like a girl to trick people
[3:36:29] <%Remery_> The traps aren't gay
[3:36:29] <Corporate_Redeemer> HE'S BASICALLY JASON
[3:36:30] <@PlagueOfGripes> and he sucks if people look down
[3:36:31] <%king_wragles> he sounds really complex
[3:36:32] <sparrrow_> traps Kappa
[3:36:32] <+TempestaDePrimo> am blind
[3:36:34] <Mopopolis> Trapper is one of the 3 vanilla killers
[3:36:34] <%ThePuddingDead> What does the Monster Hunter do!?
[3:36:36] <$thewhiterice92> How good is Japanese ghost girl?
[3:36:37] <+Story_Ark> how do you get traps?
[3:36:37] <ipwnlocks> nothing better than the sound of those traps going off
[3:36:40] <LeishmaniaForever> Paige loves traps confirmed
[3:36:44] <+Barrel_l0l> the fact that you have to fight the game itself rather than defy the killer player is a bad sign
[3:36:44] <BeeNoons> traps sfhSORA
[3:36:46] <Kratok> Well trapper also has to walk around finding his traps
[3:36:47] <ShadowSketches> if a killer uses a hex perk a dull totem around the map will be turned into a hex totem, if a survivor destroys the totem it will stop the killers perk
[3:36:49] <Corporate_Redeemer> HE'S THE BOX ART
[3:36:51] <+captain_elsewhere> very good but hard to use thewhiterice92
[3:36:52] <$rdark_ksu> i like trapper. cause nothing is more aggrivating than stepping in this games version of dog shit
[3:36:52] <mayorrev> why are you running
[3:36:52] <%king_wragles> So he takes these boys who look like girls and waits for the survivors to be the gay?
[3:36:54] <+Ace9817> LOL I'm glad someone made the trap joke
[3:36:54] <eco419> traps ikuuuuuu
[3:36:56] <+MisterCrimson> Hillbilly is leatherface, but then they put Leatherface in the game
[3:36:57] <$Sphincter_Spelunker> oink oink oink
[3:37:00] <%krawtch> the trapper kill a person then rig the body so when the cops show up the body EXPLODES and then the end of hidden agenda is really jank
[3:37:04] <mayorrev> oink
[3:37:11] <%NWR_James> WHO'S CROAKING
[3:37:12] <Mopopolis> There are traps scattered around the map, you pick them up as the killer, then it takes a couple seconds to place them down
[3:37:12] <%Raxus_Secundus> Run
[3:37:13] <%ThePuddingDead> @krawtch Fuckin LOL
[3:37:14] <mayorrev> oink for us

[4:04:10] <+Skeletorexplains> So there's no downside to D/Cing lots?
[4:04:10] <%Raxus_Secundus> Seven more
[4:04:11] <CalderGaming> that's not what "bob's your uncle" means
[4:04:12] <+Skeletorexplains> thats fucked up
[4:04:13] <FunkyStreams> WHAT DOES THAT MEAN
[4:04:14] <$AgentTexes> @PlagueOfGripes It's 4% but you can get it to over 50% with offerings and perks.
[4:04:18] <bayowolfterra> best game design. the greatest

[4:04:33] <%Puppet88> THOT SLAYER
[4:04:34] <%AncelDeLambert> I think I really hate the items in this game. I hate them being one-time uses in an ONLINE game
[4:04:34] <%CubicPhantom> the effect should at least stay for next 5 minutes or until end of match, whichever is longer
[4:04:34] <sparrrow_> THOT SLAYER
[4:04:36] <turf_wind_and_fire> THOT SLAYER
[4:04:36] <Run44forrest> LVL 50 Boss disconnect Thats how mafia works

[4:05:21] <$Sphincter_Spelunker> If she breathes
[4:05:23] <Corporate_Redeemer> MORI FOR FINAL GAME
[4:05:32] <ShadowSketches> Well survivors are all just skins
[4:05:32] <ipwnlocks> ace is a meme
[4:05:35] <ShadowSketches> his persk suck tho
[4:05:35] <@PlagueOfGripes> who
[4:05:35] <%theowlfiend> ALL wahmen are KWEENS
[4:05:35] <%ThePuddingDead> what does Mori stand for?
[4:05:36] <+MechaBaphomet> Whats mori?
[4:05:38] <+captain_elsewhere> his perks arent great
[4:05:39] <WeedSpagon> Ace looks like a dapper gentleman
[4:05:42] <%Lets_frown> @PeachSaliva He's good if he's a pet detective.
[4:05:47] <TwistedVerse> women are queens and yall are mean >:L
[4:05:47] <%ThePuddingDead> If she breathes!
[4:05:49] <%JEiddew> memento mori presumably
[4:05:50] <%TheMilhouseExperience> Jayson!
[4:05:55] <sparrrow_> All women are GASKWAHNS
[4:05:55] <@PlagueOfGripes> oh, the sleeze bag?
[4:05:58] <changtasia> halloween 2018 the movie was bretty gud
[4:05:59] <bayowolfterra> momento mori, allows the killer to kill without hooking.
[4:06:00] <%theowlfiend> YEYEYEYEYEYYE
[4:06:04] <ShadowSketches> Ace is a gentleman plague
[4:06:05] <%theowlfiend> HELLURWEEN
[4:06:10] <ShadowSketches> he wears solid gold pajamas
[4:06:14] <Run44forrest> so how badly does this run on ps4
[4:06:21] <$AgentTexes> @PeachSaliva He doesn't suck because survivors are just skins with skins, the only thing that really matters are the teachable perks.
[4:06:25] <Yummy_Nukes> Hollows Eve
[4:06:25] <+captain_elsewhere> no you have to hook once now bayowolfterra
[4:06:26] <%theowlfiend> it runs the same on ps4
[4:06:28] <@PlagueOfGripes> a problem killer games have is that the characters are designed to make you want to murder them, not to be them
[4:06:28] <randomp141> Does the match intro music reveal who's the killer?
[4:06:29] <ipwnlocks> ace is just a meme survivor
[4:06:29] <%Raxus_Secundus> What do the totems do?
[4:06:30] <+intothfanfiction> is the day by daylight story just limbo?
[4:06:33] <%Puppet88> pretty bad from what people have said
[4:06:39] <ShadowSketches> the ps4 version doesnt run great
[4:06:39] <%Keyd00d> BILLY
[4:06:42] <ShadowSketches> bad framerate
[4:06:43] <Crankthulhu> Or Leatherface
[4:06:46] <rockworm> dammit billy!
[4:06:46] <Corporate_Redeemer> Ace is just the douchy meme character. People just play him cuz he's used as a comic relief by the devs.
[4:06:46] <%Puppet88> anywhere from 15-45 ive seen people say?
[4:06:49] <@PlagueOfGripes> leave those scratchies
[4:06:52] <SirSmudgey> That was leatherface I think
[4:06:53] <bayowolfterra> Ah, my mistake. But yeah, otherwise correct.
[4:06:53] <AmanDotZip> is it part of the game how slow it is?
[4:06:54] <+RagenKajen> What do totems even do?
[4:06:57] <%Puppet88> thats was a leatherface chainsaw noise not billy
[4:07:09] <DedlokPM> @MechaBaphomet an offering that the killer can use that will let them kill without sacrificing on a hook if they meet specific conditions. Killer gets less points overall for doing the mori than saccing via hook but is a more guaranteed death
[4:07:15] <mercado94> it was me
[4:07:20] <+TempestaDePrimo> I keep misreading Leatherface as Leatherback
[4:07:20] <Crankthulhu> Yeah, Billy chainsaw is longer
[4:07:23] <Corporate_Redeemer> Like he gives finger guns when he's hooked in the promo art for the winter event
[4:07:24] <Desertfishing> billy big dick eh eh eh
[4:07:24] <mr_slaide> We demand Elmo!
[4:07:28] <+Toast_Master_General> Goodnight you fucks
[4:07:29] <+Skeletorexplains> takin' all bets, takin' all bets, How horribly will the oink-streamer die?

[4:07:55] <%JEiddew> put TF2's spy's disguises in
[4:07:55] <%Raxus_Secundus> @Skeletorexplains she will survive. No death
[4:07:59] <%Fruitywhompus> im so stressed
[4:08:01] <changtasia> those detroit QTEs are paying off
[4:08:03] <+Skeletorexplains> We got 1 bet on surviving.
[4:08:08] <Yummy_Nukes> yeah rub your hands on that generator
[4:08:09] <+MechaBaphomet> @DedlokPM Thank you!
[4:08:12] <Run44forrest> Big and Strong
[4:08:13] <ShadowSketches> Paige with the 1st blood
[4:08:14] <FunkyStreams> holy shit
[4:08:19] <%Puppet88> they need to be big enough to carry survivors and put them on hooks so little mini puppets wouldnt do
[4:08:19] <Coystick> Look at her waddle
[4:08:22] <fmc009> REMEMBER THE BASICS OF CQC
[4:08:25] <lionmanguy> The biggest and strongest
[4:08:27] <%theowlfiend> BRUTE SMARTS
[4:08:33] <ScreamingMeat> Message the generator
[4:08:35] <rockworm> repairing generators like a boss
[4:08:36] <bum_boi> @fmc009 LUL\
[4:08:38] <Corporate_Redeemer> His perks have to deal with luck and he used to be really good for unhooking yourself until they nerfed his perks. Now they just use him for his cosmetics and the memes.
[4:08:41] <sparrrow_> this feels like an Evil Within 2 zone
[4:08:46] <turf_wind_and_fire> Dude, a killer santa would've been a great addition during the holidays
[4:08:48] <ShadowSketches> Chucky will be the next licensed killer change my mind
[4:08:48] <%Fruitywhompus> ! TOXIC !
[4:08:48] <sodium_station> MAX spook
[4:08:49] <AlasterAngelo> toxic
[4:08:49] <Yummy_Nukes> peach gud at game
[4:08:56] <%ThePuddingDead> @PeachSaliva What'dya think Pat? Puppet Master for the new killer?
[4:08:57] <haisho> wow that player was baaaaaad
[4:08:59] <Desertfishing> led him right to you
[4:09:00] <ShadowSketches> Paige why not use sprint burst
[4:09:02] <%theowlfiend> sipsipRude sipsipRude sipsipRude sipsipRude
[4:09:03] <Run44forrest> oh thats gofy
[4:09:03] <bayowolfterra> lets see if the survivors are on there game and get the other generators.
[4:09:05] <vampireinarm> you got used as bait for someone else lmao
[4:09:09] <fmc009> fukt by nerds
[4:09:13] <randomp141> Needs to be a way to throw objects for distraction reasons.
[4:09:15] <Coystick> Off to the ass fucking hook
[4:09:16] <+MagickBurritoh> Paige is a shark, she can only look forwards
[4:09:18] <%theowlfiend> sbfpO sbfpN sbfpO
[4:09:18] <+Skeletorexplains> she gonna die
[4:09:19] <%RaikenTB> that hook clipping LUL
[4:09:19] <%JEiddew> that hook isn't even in her
[4:09:23] <%Raxus_Secundus> Welp, that may not have been the most prudent bet, but there is still more match to go
[4:09:26] <FunkyStreams> why does every massive 7ft tall dude become a serial killer according to hollywood?
[4:09:31] <rockworm> that other surivor ran to you so the killer would get you instead
[4:09:38] <fmc009> HELP ME BIATCH
[4:09:38] <ShadowSketches> have you tried going for Lithe or Balanced Landing then?
[4:09:41] <%Remery_> thats why you speed crouch everywhere
[4:09:48] <ShadowSketches> It lets you choose when you get the "burst"
[4:09:49] <@PlagueOfGripes> it's super easy for a killer to basically ruin your game
[4:09:50] <+RagenKajen> What do totems even do?
[4:09:51] <BigNerdSam> Can we get a compilation of all the times Paige has said "Fuck my ______"
[4:09:55] <+Skeletorexplains> paige is going crazy
[4:10:01] <AlasterAngelo> touching ur butt
[4:10:03] <%ThePuddingDead> clip it
[4:10:04] <fmc009> SAVED
[4:10:07] <@PlagueOfGripes> if the killer wants you to earn like 1k points, you're going to
[4:10:08] <+Deepfriedcthulhu> Nah Paige is right
[4:10:11] <LiquidMathew> She's going TOXIC
[4:10:12] <%TheMilhouseExperience> Dont help me off the hook - Paige, probably.
[4:10:12] <%RaikenTB> Paige wasn't crazy already?
[4:10:15] <%ThePuddingDead> just what a CRAZY PERSON would say!
[4:10:17] <+Skeletorexplains> Don't call me out, pat!
[4:10:17] <+Deepfriedcthulhu> Survivors can farm other survivors
[4:10:18] <giga_bit> It's just as easy for a group of survivors to ruin your game too.
[4:10:18] <$Sphincter_Spelunker> The crazy always think they're the sane ones
[4:10:20] <%JEiddew> paige is assuming everything is here to fuck her ass
[4:10:20] <%Spydurman> 3
[4:10:20] <mercado94> is she?
[4:10:21] <%Keyd00d> weird game
[4:10:22] <fmc009> TOXIC LUL

[4:10:28] <sparrrow_> TOXIC
[4:10:30] <harrydeans_hawaiian_shirt> pat looks uncomfortable
[4:10:33] <+Nomicro4u> Playing multiplayer will do that to you
[4:10:33] <changtasia> is there voicechat in the game?
[4:10:36] <%theowlfiend> sipsipHonk sipsipHonk sipsipHonk sipsipHonk
[4:10:39] <%Lets_frown> @PeachSaliva Paige you're so buttfucktoxic
[4:10:39] <%RaikenTB> That's right, Jay!
[4:10:40] <vampireinarm> Isnt it tho?
[4:10:42] <JackalKing> Isn't it!?
[4:10:43] <%Spydurman> all snooty for the booty
[4:10:45] <sodium_station> it fucks like a duck?
[4:10:45] <+connos_livereview> thats right jay
[4:10:45] <+captain_elsewhere> no thats part of the game changtasia
[4:10:45] <ScreamingMeat> ! Frenzy !
[4:10:47] <leinadtonu> how do you
[4:10:49] <fmc009> THANK GOD
[4:10:49] <SGrim> HOW DARE YOU TRY AND GET A GOOD SCORE rooREE
[4:10:49] <turf_wind_and_fire> and fucks like a duck?
[4:10:49] <LiquidMathew> STOP PUTTING DUCKS UP YOU BUTT!
[4:10:49] <+Skeletorexplains> thank god
[4:10:53] <%ThePuddingDead> even in the team?
[4:10:54] <SirSmudgey> MORI
[4:10:55] <@PlagueOfGripes> the one thing I don't like about friday the 13th
[4:10:57] <Corporate_Redeemer> Survivors will farm hooked survivors using WE'RE GONNA LIVE FOREVER for extra bloodpoints. it's super toxic since they basically kill you by unhooking you in front of the killer. Paige is super right here.
[4:10:58] <BrachyZoid> If I may ask. Keeping in the theme of the game. Favorite Horror movie tropes??
[4:11:03] <Luesagna00> @peachsaliva you went on a 30 minute racist tirade it was weird
[4:11:05] <%theowlfiend> THATS RIGHT JAY
[4:11:08] <DedlokPM> @Skeletorexplains No it is a thing. People will unhook you right in front of the killer for the points, but they also made it so that there is a point penalty for doing so, but the penalty is less than the point gain still.
[4:11:09] <+JenovasPuppet> Does her sweater say SWISH?
[4:11:09] <+captain_elsewhere> yes ThePuddingDead because voicechat makes the game stupid easy
[4:11:13] <$AgentTexes> No, if they're running up to unhook you while in the killer's terror radius they're either stupid or farming. Not helping.
[4:11:14] <leinadtonu> how do you farm these blood points?
[4:11:16] <%ThePuddingDead> ohhhh i see
[4:11:16] <ShadowSketches> get out the house Paige
[4:11:17] <%Lets_frown> sa
[4:11:20] <fmc009> STAY THE HIDDEN
[4:11:21] <bryanmildew> yes it does
[4:11:22] <turf_wind_and_fire> There's a closet on the back porch
[4:11:29] <+Deepfriedcthulhu> DON'T GO INTO THE BASEMENT VS LEATHERFACE
[4:11:32] <+Deepfriedcthulhu> that is how you die
[4:11:35] <+AXL808> Paige still needs to pick up her blood echoes
[4:11:41] <ShadowSketches> your toolbox is better than that key
[4:11:43] <SirSmudgey> Thats a worthless broken key
[4:11:44] <Yummy_Nukes> DOWN IN THE PEACH PIT
[4:11:47] <@PlagueOfGripes> I'm still not clear what keys do
[4:11:53] <%Djinnazz> why are you hiding in the rape dungeon?
[4:11:55] <fmc009> THIS IS SO RISKY. THE TENSION
[4:11:55] <%ThePuddingDead> not wrong
[4:11:56] <ShadowSketches> keys only do things with addons
[4:11:56] <sparrrow_> collect the Fart Echoes
[4:11:57] <ShichiNoBushi> When the murder-guy Flattens you like a pizza-pie That's a Mori
[4:12:04] <+ItsNineTen> Bubbys Basement time
[4:12:06] <+Skeletorexplains> a machine of peach
[4:12:09] <%Puppet88> broken keys are only for keeping track of the killer or teammates
[4:12:12] <a_mad_dragon> is the peach pit near the woolie hole?
[4:12:13] <Rivalshotzgp> @plagueofgripes Open the traps door whenever
[4:12:17] <%Keyd00d> no upstairs for you
[4:12:18] <SGrim> @PlagueOfGripes a complete kay allows you to open the hatch with multiple survivors still in the game.
[4:12:18] <%ThePuddingDead> hide bitch!
[4:12:22] <+Deepfriedcthulhu> Going into the basement vs Leatherface is a great way to get permahooked
[4:12:25] <%Puppet88> unbroken keys do the same but also can unlock the hatch if you find it
[4:12:27] <Reanimator83> Blair Witch in a corner and scare the shit outta the killer
[4:12:28] <@PlagueOfGripes> but the whole point of the game is to be alive as long as possible, not to leave
[4:12:31] <+captain_elsewhere> keys also have the ability to reaveal other survivors if they are nearby by using addons
[4:12:34] <@PlagueOfGripes> why would you bring a key
[4:12:39] <TwistedVerse> waiting for the killer to break in like the cool-aid man
[4:12:39] <Coystick> So this is set in an Evil WITHIN Nightmare dimension isn't it?
[4:12:43] <TwistedVerse> oHYeA
[4:12:44] <SirSmudgey> Hiding in lockers blocks BBQ now
[4:12:49] <ShadowSketches> well you bring keys because escaping gives you the most bloodpoints
[4:12:50] <DedlokPM> @PlagueOfGripes depends on the rarity and the add-ons put on it. mostly used to either open the hatch earlier/for multiple people
[4:12:52] <%ThePuddingDead> u dead
[4:12:54] <%Raxus_Secundus> Run Paige
[4:12:56] <SGrim> @PlagueOfGripes you still can't open the hatch until the generators are completed.
[4:12:58] <$AgentTexes> @PlagueOfGripes You get more points by getting out from the hatch.
[4:12:59] <TwistedVerse> f
[4:13:01] <AmanDotZip> no I will not fuck your ass
[4:13:02] <Coystick> Oh lawd he coming
[4:13:10] <Rivalshotzgp> @plagueofgripes Essentially taunting, or escaping doctor with more blood points
[4:13:11] <%ThePuddingDead> great camera angle
[4:13:11] <+MagickBurritoh> YEYEYEYYEYEE
[4:13:12] <+Skeletorexplains> nice
[4:13:13] <%Keyd00d> INVISBILE
[4:13:13] <@PlagueOfGripes> if a killer sees you, you basically aren't going to get away unless he gets bored

[4:14:02] <$AgentTexes> This is not a game, this is a bug that happens to have a game in it.
[4:14:05] <SGrim> @TwistedVerse you could say... a Ghost Faced killa

[4:14:22] <vampireinarm> this is the wrong stream now
[4:14:22] <mr_slaide> We demand Elmo!

[4:14:26] <+babrukus> hiii pat
[4:14:26] <haisho> I can't believe Simple and Clean's music video was literally a giant pun
[4:14:26] <%RaikenTB> Paige-sized dent in the couch.
[4:14:28] <Luesagna00> had no idea this was indie
[4:14:29] <%ThePuddingDead> too bad

[4:14:30] <LeishmaniaForever> Just let it go Pat
[4:14:30] <BrachyZoid> I'm pretty sure that Plague having fun unleashes Ragnarok
[4:14:31] <+flyingsnakes3> Don't cross the streams with paige pat

[4:14:34] <%ThePuddingDead> apologize to your fans
[4:14:34] <DedlokPM> @PlagueOfGripes depends on how well the survivor knows the map/pallet looping. I have seen survivors literally make a killer chase them while his teammates do all 5 generators.
[4:14:35] <leinadtonu> play a killer pato
[4:14:36] <%MightyMaxT> Swollowed pickle juice down the wrong pipe. Sucked

[4:39:53] <AmanDotZip> what are you talking about no you wouldnt
[4:39:54] <%JEiddew> not really, overwatch is pretty lax afaik
[4:39:55] <$Sphincter_Spelunker> Good Gob
[4:39:56] <%jiin6> GG gets ya banned
[4:39:57] <%TheMilhouseExperience> GG is a racial slur
[4:39:57] <hntronium> Overwatch is for prissy bitches
[4:39:58] <%MightyMaxT> Good...Gob?
[4:39:58] <%AncelDeLambert> OW is such garbage
[4:39:58] <mercado94> another reason why to not play overwatch
[4:39:59] <+MagickBurritoh> "Good game" is toxic?
[4:40:00] <raminnoodle420> gg ez gets recensored in overwatch
[4:40:02] <Bouldus> GG gets you banned in a ton of stuff because people are children
[4:40:03] <+TempestaDePrimo> GG = Good job?
[4:40:04] <%ThePuddingDead> yeah....fuck overwatch
[4:40:04] <Coystick> >Ovarywatch
[4:40:05] <SGrim> GG no rooREE
[4:40:06] <DedlokPM> gg ez and gg no re is toxic. But in most contexts gg by itself is not toxic
[4:40:07] <BrachyZoid> Every now and then you will have one game with good people
[4:40:07] <ScreamingMeat> That's stupid
[4:40:10] <+TheArrow_> GG means extreme
[4:40:11] <+Mittensbro> "gg ez" gets wordfiltered
[4:40:11] <Run44forrest> Good Gob
[4:40:12] <kascadekitty_7> do people still say gg no re?
[4:40:13] <Yummy_Nukes> GG EQUALS NAZI
[4:40:13] <$Hiro01231> Job is spelled with is G
[4:40:13] <Smaenus> GGEZ they filter in OW last I played yeah
[4:40:13] <@PlagueOfGripes> saying GG when everyone knows it was a lopsided match is where that comes from
[4:40:13] <%lykos_sif> When did 'gg' become bad to do?
[4:40:14] <Caidezes> Paige the supportive player.
[4:40:15] <zettig> Good Giob
[4:40:16] <IshikawaKenji> paige did you write the pat ending for ahegao academy
[4:40:17] <%JEiddew> gg ez and ezpz get turned in to short self-deprecating messages
[4:40:18] <%Remery_> Overwatch is ridiculous and full of sensitive babies who desperately want to know every heroes sexuality
[4:40:19] <AmanDotZip> No I'm the only person who likes overwatch in this game and im proud
[4:40:20] <TwistedVerse> say oui oui instead, sounds close to gg LUL
[4:40:21] <+connos_livereview> i a;ways say GG EZ in rocket league
[4:40:21] <$nademonkey1100> wait wait wati gg get baned in overwatch
[4:40:22] <Sitinomi> I see GG in overwatch all the time though?
[4:40:28] <%jiin6> Overwatch is sad game
[4:40:33] <bayowolfterra> eh
[4:40:36] <ScreamingMeat> Overwatch is full of cunts
[4:40:38] <Sitinomi> yes, it is a sad game
[4:40:38] <Run44forrest> Gamer Gate EZ
[4:40:38] <+Gravity_Gunner> GG doesn’t get you banned in Overwatch. ‘GG EZ’ probably won’t either.
[4:40:40] <leinadtonu> ironic GG
[4:40:41] <+Story_Ark> @peachsaliva if you say gg ez, itll change it to something funny like "mom says its my bedtime"
[4:40:42] <BeeNoons> ggez replaces with phrases like "sorry, my mom says I have to go" or stuff like that
[4:40:42] <$nademonkey1100> sooooo what if it was a lop sided match
[4:40:42] <bsmusic> when did "good game" become so bad
[4:40:43] <mercado94> overwatch: great porn, lame game
[4:40:47] <Jarvanii> just say nothing, it's the only way to win
[4:40:48] <eco419> i miss the old days
[4:40:52] <count_bob> Oh! @PeachSaliva Did you hear in Europe McDonalds lost the rights to the Big Mac?
[4:40:53] <AmanDotZip> One time I got stomped in Overwatch and someone said "I remember my first match"
[4:40:54] <BrachyZoid> Didn't like... half the people in tonight's games disconnected right?
[4:40:54] <raminnoodle420> Overwatch is the best game of passive agressiveness
[4:40:54] <%TheMilhouseExperience> People are actual full retard.
[4:40:57] <FunkyStreams> gg
[4:40:58] <%Verd_254> That is nonsense. Saying GG is supposed to be polite regardless.
[4:41:01] <AlasterAngelo> Pat you're really good at acting smug. Too good actually
[4:41:02] <leinadtonu> sarcastic GG?
[4:41:04] <%lykos_sif> People suck.
[4:41:04] <eco419> fucking softies
[4:41:04] <mercado94> yeah I like that idea
[4:41:10] <%JEiddew> I like Overwatch but playing it competitively is omegalul foolish
[4:41:12] <TwistedVerse> TOXICITY IN MY PORN GAME?? >:L
[4:41:16] <ghostoctopus1602> i

[4:41:20] <turf_wind_and_fire> Pat asmr Super Toxic LUL
[4:41:21] <%Remery_> @mercado94 the porn keeps the game afloat, like people knew about the porn before the game even came out
[4:41:21] <%king_wragles> That's right Jay, SUPER TOXIC.
[4:41:22] <LeishmaniaForever> Good Jorb
[4:41:24] <%CubicPhantom> i'm used to the starcraft version of GG where it means GG. salty fucks just complain that your race is OP
[4:41:27] <Bouldus> yea i use it really genuinely i do actually mean good game
[4:41:29] <$Sphincter_Spelunker> Shroedinger's matches
[4:41:36] <%druvirus> It's like saying "Have a good day" when you just made a mess of the chill space at work as you're leaving
[4:41:36] <bryanmildew> is there really porn of this?
[4:41:37] <+Cigwynn> LUL
[4:41:38] <$rdark_ksu> What if we just make everything so toxic that it becomes the new normal
[4:41:39] <+HRDSalami654> It's more likely than you would think.
[4:41:41] <TwistedVerse> shit in mah pants rn tbh lul
[4:41:41] <+Nomicro4u> I love the pretend typing
[4:41:42] <FunkyStreams> yep
[4:41:43] <+Story_Ark> @peachsaliva in overwatch if you say gg ez, itll change it to something like "mom says i have to log off" or something
[4:41:48] <+Camail> I have never seen a legit sarcastic gg, salty bitches aren’t subtle
[4:41:49] <@PlagueOfGripes> I like it when the killer actually helps you out, but it's rare
[4:41:51] <BrachyZoid> So like every game
[4:41:51] <$Falilth> was that the smash tournament guy?
[4:41:53] <+babrukus> god I love the salt mines
[4:41:54] <ShichiNoBushi> Good Jearbb

[4:42:05] <Smaenus> Man I played Rust again the other day, the saltiest bois of all time goddamn
[4:42:12] <%lykos_sif> This stream was fun. 10/10 would watch again.
[4:42:13] <ghostoctopus1602> i missed the stream because my brother is toxic. thanks alcoholism
[4:42:18] <FunkyStreams> bullshit
[4:42:20] <+MagickBurritoh> !COLLUSION!
[4:42:24] <%jiin6> Killer may spare you as the last one
[4:42:27] <TwistedVerse> h a c k e r m a n logging in CoolCat
[4:42:27] <DraxTD> can we see @PeachSaliva type in chat live?!
[4:42:31] <$Sphincter_Spelunker> Banned from tourneys
[4:42:33] <%ShinobiPhoenix> and "gay" was just supposed to mean you were happy, humans ruin everything eventually. Dracula was right to want to be rid of us.
[4:42:37] <%ThePuddingDead> He was like "Oh my gosh are you ok?"
[4:42:38] <ghostoctopus1602> sorry was that toxic?
[4:42:38] <FunkyStreams> that one time it happens all the time
[4:42:38] <BrachyZoid> I used to do that in Dark Souls 2. Invading and cleaning the horrible tomb with the enemy spawners
[4:42:38] <bayowolfterra> i do it if their deck is super stacked
[4:42:42] <AlasterAngelo> "We allowed him to hook us a couple of times"
[4:42:44] <@PlagueOfGripes> the fact that the game works that way at all, though...
[4:42:54] <ArtThouBored> I was too busy playing Astaroth in Soul Calibur 6 and so I missed your entire stream...whoooooooops
[4:43:04] <%galaxyswirl> thats honestly dumb
[4:43:05] <$maverickleeback> cheer1000 Just got off HBomberguy's stream- 340,000 dollars <3 <3 <3 Have a lovely night. Also my girlfriend and I are getting a cat named Kirby <3
[4:43:05] <TwistedVerse> so roleplaying.. instead of actually playing is more enjoyable you say?
[4:43:06] <BrachyZoid> Supah Toxic
[4:43:06] <+Nomicro4u> They all said GG
[4:43:08] <LeishmaniaForever> And that guys name? Albert Einstein
[4:43:08] <%jiin6> Humanity creates corruption
[4:43:12] <rockworm> that killer's name Albert Einstein
[4:43:13] <%TheMilhouseExperience> And it was a big gay hand holding time
[4:43:15] <TwistedVerse> never break immersion
[4:43:16] <bayowolfterra> DBD has a very loose definition of "win condition"
[4:43:17] <+SWindleFeD> Nah fuck that, if I win it's gonna be because I was better than the other guy
[4:43:18] <Yummy_Nukes> BIG SEXY TOXIC TIME
[4:43:18] <leinadtonu> weird for a competitive game...
[4:43:22] <%AncelDeLambert> And then the entire restaurant CLAPPED

[4:43:32] <%Remery_> you win in your heart
[4:43:33] <raminnoodle420> That killers name, Mother Teresa
[4:43:34] <+Camail> Play to win
[4:43:35] <@PlagueOfGripes> They thought Einstein was crazy until he started KICKIN ASS
[4:43:36] <blademaster247> And that dick's name is Albert Einsdick
[4:43:37] <DuoScratch> Most of the time, if a couple of survs DC, I'll just kill ppl super quick just to get to a better match.
[4:43:44] <AlasterAngelo> That killer grew up to be Hitler
[4:43:51] <%SWFanatic> Great stream. Hope more dbd streams in the future. Good night.

[4:52:15] <TwistedVerse> elmos tail is moving, clearly the tail controls the cat

[4:53:30] <%JEiddew> a normal sized dick on him looks massive
[4:53:33] <%ShinobiPhoenix> Wait, I got it. Scream should make a random survivor INTO a second killer, but the other Survivors don't know he's a traitor and helping to kill them or kill them him/herself
[4:53:33] <ArtThouBored> @TempestaDePrimo He'd just be stealing Chucky's gimmick
[4:53:36] <dungpie64> Bonewheels from Dark Souls

[4:56:46] <bryanmildew> canadian geese were invented by pierre canada
[4:56:48] <SGrim> @PeachSaliva lots of North American animals ended up in England as Curios and Zoo exibihits... COLONIALISM

[4:57:11] <+unclekulikov> REGULAR SHOW
[4:57:13] <ShichiNoBushi> Was watching a video on YouTube of another stream of Metroid Prime and they compared the Chozo to swans, and in one of the videos, one of the commentators explained an ordeal trying to find out if swans have dicks without putting suspicious words into the search field.
[4:57:13] <TwistedVerse> false, no turducken is edible
[4:57:14] <Bouldus> mother fucker
[4:57:15] <%JEiddew> They're not Canadian Geese they're Canada Geese god damn it.

[4:57:17] <$Agami23> paige, remember when you were worried about being too hot for the streams?
[4:57:20] <$rdark_ksu> canadian geese were born from the sweat from Lokis ass
[4:57:24] <@PlagueOfGripes> Canadian Geese are geese that fled cowardly from America during the revolution, after they betrayed us to the British
[4:57:25] <Intolerable> ELMO SO BRIGHT
[4:57:25] <mercado94> Einstein invented canadian gesee
[4:57:27] <sodium_station> that can't be true chat is liars

[5:04:49] <TwistedVerse> plague whats your fursona? all of them? >:L aAAAHH
[5:04:49] <Endocrom> Guns open to show respect
[5:04:50] <$rdark_ksu> Paige's fursona is like a badger or something, sassy and wants their trash pile their way
