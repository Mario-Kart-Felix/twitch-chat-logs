[0:16:21] <+psidefx> Is it a pog of the month thing now?
[0:16:22] <shieldecho> Start with IX
[0:16:24] <Srthunda> I started with 14
[0:16:25] <%samTUMZlettuce> Choo Chooo HypeRogue
[0:16:26] <%Lunarhawk> Start with World of Final Fantasy cowards
[0:16:27] <cureneckbeard> 6
[0:16:28] <D3rrtyD4n> 10!?!?
[0:16:31] <CanadianAnimatorGuy> 10? gross 6 IS THE BEST
[0:16:32] <Profmcstevie> But..Final Fantasy X is weird within the entire series isn't it?
[0:16:32] <bob900000> 10 came out in 2001
[0:16:33] <BoxNavy> 6 or 7 :)
[0:16:34] <%Agami23> i feel like 5 is a good starting place
[0:16:34] <+kyh9> All the modern releases of 6 are dogshit though. iOS and Steam versions of 6 are TERRIBLE
[0:16:35] <TomCrimson> but youre not wrong!!!
[0:16:35] <%Bluwizard21> i started with the first one on nes
[0:16:36] <aeonicvector> 4 or 9 bruh
[0:16:36] <+jiggy_snipe> why would you start with 10?
[0:16:37] <@commanderclaw> It's not like X turns 20 this year or something
[0:16:37] <+chase959> I only ever beat the one and two remake for psp
[0:16:37] <+pleblu> wtf why 10
[0:16:37] <+TheotherKristian> I started with XV and IV
[0:16:37] <cache_22> But FF X has the Ah Bed.
[0:16:37] <T_Sasquatch> start with 14
[0:16:37] <%grimmsean> I started with tactics...
[0:16:38] <TurtlesAndTentacles> PogChamp
[0:16:38] <orpleborple> cause the real pog man is actually a warlord
[0:16:39] <shieldecho> Hell, Remake doesn't suck
[0:16:39] <+Figleafplays> 10s a pretty good place to start
[0:16:40] <Blank9> start with 10 is good
[0:16:41] <mousesorcerer> HypeRogue HypeRogue HypeRogue
[0:16:43] <$JoshManVGH> 6 would be great it it was more readily available.
[0:16:44] <+Gouf_Troop> 6 is my first and i was born in 99 so dont worry
[0:16:45] <CanadianAnimatorGuy> YES
[0:16:47] <NoHoldsBarredProductions> You're right though, she should start with 6. Fuck maybe even 4.
[0:16:48] <mike2hands> PogChamp PogChamp PogChamp PogChamp PogChamp PogChamp PogChamp PogChamp
[0:16:49] <%Lion_kun> Why not 9?
[0:16:50] <cureneckbeard> you have to start with 1 and then give up because it sucks by modern standards
[0:16:50] <Tooniearcade> BUT YOURE RIGHT
[0:16:51] <+kyh9> Only the SNES and GBA versions of 6 are good
[0:16:52] <bob900000> 6 is my favorite game
[0:16:54] <+McSoliace> chat showing there age
[0:16:55] <+jiggy_snipe> yea start with 4
[0:16:55] <%ssjklyco> Here's robot shit in 6
[0:16:55] <Jetsfantasy> Six has the retro with a touch of more modern
[0:16:56] <cache_22> I started with FF IV, it is great.
[0:16:56] <mike2hands> Yes
[0:16:57] <D3rrtyD4n> im not a huge fan of 10
[0:16:57] <Coystick> Oh she's a giant cat again
[0:16:58] <+chase959> 1/4-1/2 thru a bunch but only beat the first one
[0:16:58] <+kyh9> Perfect first is 4
[0:17:01] <TheIncoherentGamer> 6 also has the best villain
[0:17:02] <Laecerelius> 4/6/7 would probably be the best firsts
[0:17:04] <aeonicvector> 9s great cause its the middle point of all FFs
[0:17:04] <Blank9> I fell out of 6 fast back on the PS1
[0:17:07] <Coystick> CECIL SQUAD SOUND OFF
[0:17:08] <blackbaron98> 6 was my first, played it on a emulator
[0:17:08] <xXjuffelXx> I started with 3 with the DS remake
[0:17:11] <twistedj3ster> Yeah? Then how come Yang is still DEAD
[0:17:11] <cureneckbeard> Sir Sabin!
[0:17:17] <BoxNavy> you cant go wrong with 4-10 so whatever
[0:17:18] <%Lion_kun> My first was 7 remake which was a baaaad idea.
[0:17:18] <XeroSigmaPrime> 6 is the best!
[0:17:18] <%grimmsean> nice
[0:17:22] <+Fooguwu> nice
[0:17:22] <aeonicvector> 6 or 9? nice
[0:17:22] <CanadianAnimatorGuy> 6 9 nice
[0:17:23] <Psyramics> 10 is the most modern game that still feels like an older FF game
[0:17:23] <$sumrand0> Did you know the phrase POG originates from the 90s fad known as Pogs. The kid with the coolest slammers was always declared the POG champ and granted VIP status in their social network!
[0:17:25] <%vehementvadr> what about 3
[0:17:25] <Hellvis92> is yang still dead?
[0:17:27] <+Someitalian123> what about 7
[0:17:28] <BlkFlameKami> shit all over 10 paige
[0:17:28] <Pookiedaexzile> Start FF with playing ChronoTrigger
[0:17:28] <laserbeaming> 5 presents you with ALL the series conventions.
[0:17:29] <+kyh9> 10 sold the best for a reason
[0:17:30] <mike2hands> 6 is the only one that ive played and is pretty entretainting
[0:17:32] <FirstFireKeeper> 7r dont scare them away
[0:17:37] <%samTUMZlettuce> :D
[0:17:37] <+kyh9> 10 is the first 'pretty' final fantasy

[0:42:41] <cureneckbeard> big smart
[0:42:43] <%KeiganOfAstora> Cancer is inherently natural to all life forms. Cancer is just cells that fucked up when sub-dividing. As we get older it tends to happen more often. Small tumors form, that kinda thing. Usually it's nothing to worry about but when it is, it's cancer. I no longer get upset when an old person dies of cancer. It's basically their body saying "We've done enough, time to go"
[0:42:45] <BoxNavy> woo

[1:09:20] <+patriotrenegade> @PeachSaliva When I saw the Expendables in theaters here in California, everyone cheered when Arnold Schwarzenegger had his cameo

[1:09:30] <CanadianAnimatorGuy> Same with The Hobbit 3
[1:09:31] <LVL1_Scumbag> What audiences are noisy?
[1:09:32] <%samTUMZlettuce> You can track political dogshit with the growth of Youtubers talking about what Rian Johnson did....

[1:12:44] <TheCrispyBoi> star forge
[1:12:44] <dizimous> It would be less bad to just say " The entire sequel trilogy was a dream"
[1:12:44] <+RealThiele> man if palpatines ships were illusions that wouldve been better
[1:12:45] <+Euphbugg> Frodo hero of all movies

[1:13:08] <+tigerfang86> PRANKED
[1:13:09] <X2Eliah> Yeah Hobbit is NOTHING compared to star wars
[1:13:12] <AxelCezar> Lord of the Rings will be shat on plenty with the new series
[1:13:12] <TheEndlessRiver1> the hobbit moves are bad but the worst thing they added was the love triangle
[1:13:14] <+tigerfang86> PRANKED PRO
[1:13:15] <%rumtumtugnutz> frodo is the worst hobbit.
[1:13:15] <LVL1_Scumbag> They did their piece and STOPPED

[1:13:19] <OldManDeckardCain> the hobbit triology was so awful tho
[1:13:20] <Coystick> on rewatch most of the Hobbits is watchable
[1:13:21] <CanadianAnimatorGuy> My Star Wars friend told me they're working on making multiple universe stuffs in a weird roundabout way to make the sequels non-canon
[1:13:22] <+Jp3g95> Jebaited
[1:13:22] <$sumrand0> Make a good product and STOP once youre out of ideas for good products DONT make bad products those are bad
[1:13:24] <%samTUMZlettuce> I DON'T DRINK OFTEN
[1:13:24] <%a_goth_pancake> except the tv show on amazon.
[1:13:26] <DrkJP520> Hobbit movies are so boring. LotR movies are fucking masterpieces
[1:13:27] <Monkeyweed21> NEVER FORGET THE FART FETISH WEDDING
[1:13:28] <TurtlesAndTentacles> Given how Racist Tolkien was? yes
[1:13:29] <%king_wragles> I mean, it ruins and fucks with the plot of The Hobbit but the rest of TLOTR is unaffected
[1:13:29] <+CptnCampy61> The hobbit wasn’t hot garbage
[1:13:31] <%AncelDeLambert> Time to take over the world!
[1:13:32] <+RealThiele> hobbit trilogy was a hot mess
[1:13:35] <%walternatorz> they still have the LotR amazone series
[1:13:36] <Laecerelius> Don't have to worry about monsters hurting you if you kill them
[1:13:36] <D3rrtyD4n> say what you want about the hobbit, but its no episode 9

[1:13:51] <Xeno351> the sequels were SO BAD that they made people ok with the prequels
[1:13:51] <LVL1_Scumbag> Ohai Mozgus
[1:13:52] <%AncelDeLambert> @PeachSaliva rifftrax definitely helps that
[1:13:52] <metalsiren31> So I can buy that somebody could build a giant fleet of Star Destroyers and bury them in a planet, the Empire had shittons of money. BUT WHO WAS THE CREW!? Do they expect us to believe they've just been waiting there for 20 years!?
[1:13:53] <+AkronymCLT> LotR will be fine because you can always say "The books are still good"

[1:14:29] <%ThomasOfTroy> Honestly, I thought the extended cuts of lotr made them better
[1:14:31] <SuperChumps> @PeachSaliva The extended versions ARE SOO MUCH BETTER
[1:14:32] <SpaceManHotepIV> do it Paige.
[1:14:35] <X2Eliah> I did that; it's worse than I remembered
[1:14:36] <Dragovus> Disney is NOT cannon
[1:14:36] <+tigerfang86> OOF
[1:14:36] <+D00msDayDan> I watched the whole lotr trilogy on a 12 hour flight from hk to california and retained none of it

[1:14:51] <Dragovus> China didn't like Finn
[1:14:51] <Aydarkzero> wasn't he suppose to be a Jedi?
[1:14:52] <Blank9> remember when finn was cut out of posters because china hates black people
[1:14:54] <QueequegTheater> IMO Last Jedi, despite having massive problems, is still the least shit of the sequels
[1:14:54] <$Tredecian> fuck

[1:14:54] <2Bs_USB_port> chug that chinese dick

[1:15:08] <+Movemeister> LUL
[1:15:08] <CanadianAnimatorGuy> What about Rose?
[1:15:09] <%MisterRockett> The fact that the new Star Wars is bad because racism made them bench the best character in the new trilogy is hilariously depressing.
[1:15:09] <Explodincatz> Page pisses on Finn love interest
[1:15:09] <T_Sasquatch> yes black storm trooper girl

[1:15:36] <+Movemeister> And then Lando giving that girl the FUCK eyes at the end
[1:15:36] <+captain_thickthighs> Worst is the original script for the third movie was great
[1:15:37] <%Too_Much_Nukie> China doesn't like interracial gay couples.
[1:15:38] <UlriktheSlayer1> poe got the bounty hunter girl who has like 2 seconds of screen time

[1:17:06] <DrkJP520> she's bayonetta's mom
[1:17:07] <Tooniearcade> She got short end of the stick
[1:17:07] <SaphronBlackbourne> Which actress got like, bullied off of Twitter was it her
[1:17:08] <%Too_Much_Nukie> Rose was added just so they could have an Asian character.
[1:17:08] <anAngryHamster> Don't blame actors for the writer's/director's desicions
[1:17:09] <TurtlesAndTentacles> Oscar Issac is going to be Moon Knight
[1:17:11] <@CreepyPorpoise> They're using that actress again for the new disney animated film
[1:17:11] <%mousesorcerer> ...."I don't know"
[1:17:11] <+LiquidDinosaur> @KeiganOfAstora i fucking HATE those two-knife bitches
[1:17:11] <shieldecho> Rose's actress is voicing the next Disney princess so she's got that going for her
[1:17:11] <UncleAndross_> the actors are great - the character was yikes
[1:17:12] <%samTUMZlettuce> It's not even funny.
[1:17:12] <+CptnCampy61> The actress got screwed. Rose is terrible
[1:17:12] <%Too_Much_Nukie> And then ironically they forget about her.
[1:17:13] <nivlac_555> the actress got a shit hand
[1:17:14] <X2Eliah> Good actors, just shitty scripts
[1:17:16] <%SharkMissile> Adam Driver is soooooo much better than they gave him
[1:17:17] <+ClericOfSparda> The actors who played Hook & Smee in "Hook" did the same thing. they played the characters as in a relationship.
[1:17:18] <+NWR_James> The actress is fine. The role sucks. The audience sucks more.
[1:17:19] <T_Sasquatch> @TurtlesAndTentacles SERIOUSLY ???
[1:17:23] <UlriktheSlayer1> they had great characters waiting to happen and no one could write them well
[1:17:25] <+FilthyHereticHorus> Name one other thing the actress has been in @PeachSaliva
[1:17:26] <%Too_Much_Nukie> Over an hour for sure.
[1:17:26] <Pappajimbo> oh yes
[1:17:27] <peachy996> Oscar Isaac was Apocalypse in Xmen
[1:17:32] <+VintageSpiffy> VintageSpiffy subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 7 months! 
[1:17:33] <$sumrand0> The actors are "just following orders" they're not responsible for the things they make/participate in!
[1:17:36] <+LensWander> Additionally Hollywood movies in China sometimes have new scenes added for propaganda purposes
[1:17:40] <CanadianAnimatorGuy> I feel bad for Geoffery's actor, god damn
[1:17:42] <anAngryHamster> They never bothered to film Tom Bombadil though
[1:17:42] <peachy996> Shame he got very little screen time
[1:17:44] <Aydarkzero> you can dislike the character but not the actor
[1:17:45] <%samTUMZlettuce> It's industrial as fuck.
[1:17:49] <X2Eliah> xD
[1:17:49] <nivlac_555> lol
[1:17:51] <%samTUMZlettuce> So stupid.
[1:17:52] <+LiquidDinosaur> The villain in Ben Hur played it like he and Ben Hur were ex-lovers but they had to hide that fact from Charlton Heston who was SUPER insecure in his heterosexuality
[1:17:52] <DjFrostBite95> LUL
[1:17:54] <UlriktheSlayer1> YEAH
[1:17:54] <+gimmickypizza> lol
[1:17:56] <$JoshManVGH> Rogue One is better if you cut out Vaders earlier scene
[1:17:58] <Xeno351> Adam driver is actually insanely good as an actor, I was shocked how good he is in other things
[1:17:59] <%valriot> Remember when Rose, the Chinese actress, kissed Finn, and then disappeared in the 3rd movie, as if the reception to that scene was bad to a certain audience
[1:18:01] <%samTUMZlettuce> Lucasfilm FUCKED
[1:18:05] <dizimous> S A V I N G W H A T W E L O V E
[1:18:06] <%king_wragles> I WILL FIGHT FOR LOOOOVVVEEEE
[1:18:06] <user_naim> Fuck the casino planet
[1:18:07] <+tigerfang86> we don't need LUKE BREAKING DOWN over HAN DEATH
[1:18:07] <+RealThiele> topher graces prequel cut
[1:18:09] <NocturnalRites> Good because Bombadil is not for general audiences
[1:18:11] <%AncelDeLambert> nnnope
[1:18:12] <+Fooguwu> play the game paige
[1:18:12] <UlriktheSlayer1> canto byte that fucking casino planet is such a god awful sequence
[1:18:14] <+captain_thickthighs> rose despawned
[1:18:15] <+CptnCampy61> Fuck Casino planet
[1:18:16] <Skatedeandre> Yeah she’s gone from the 3rd movie
[1:18:17] <Aydarkzero> @JoshManVGH where he's talking to that guy in the white?
[1:18:17] <islandsunn> they should have just cut all the parts on the spaceship
[1:18:17] <+burntbagels13> Phantom Menace literally ruined Jake Lloyds life
[1:18:17] <%emoonimoo> That South Park episode about Hollywood/Disney doing everything they can to appease China is so accurate knowing everything we do now
[1:18:18] <QueequegTheater> @PeachSaliva I hate it because TLJ has absolutely my favorite parts in it but so much of it is fucking terrible
[1:18:18] <+BigCoffee> Rose's character kinda sucked however. the whole casino arc was a waste of time
[1:18:20] <islandsunn> ruined the pacing
[1:18:21] <%BoxNavy> i love this podcast stream
[1:18:21] <bob900000> finn had a good deleted scene
[1:18:22] <%Lunarhawk> Its weird cause Rise of Skywalker is the exact opposite where everything is so rushed its terrible. People literally teleport across the universe instead of using space travel
[1:18:24] <T_Sasquatch> What do you mean we cant just wing a triology
[1:18:24] <LVL1_Scumbag> Why are you like this?
[1:18:26] <+CptnCampy61> Rose was never missed
[1:18:27] <+LiquidDinosaur> Charlton Heston also refused to accept that Michelangelo was confirmed super gay
[1:18:27] <T_Sasquatch> just WING IT
[1:18:30] <Pappajimbo> they cut the scean where luke mornes for han. Why would you cut that
[1:18:30] <%valriot> FUCK THAT GUY
[1:18:31] <%AncelDeLambert> c'mon, Paige, you can make it to the next shortcut, you can do it
[1:18:33] <%samTUMZlettuce> It would have helped.
[1:18:34] <T_Sasquatch> fuck do you need planning for
[1:18:34] <%KeiganOfAstora> You shouold be mad
[1:18:35] <Aydarkzero> lmao

[1:18:41] <%mousesorcerer> I love Topher
[1:18:42] <TurtlesAndTentacles> The casino scene and Rose was not needed
[1:18:42] <$JoshManVGH> @aydarkzero Yeah, I think Red Letter Media pointed that out
[1:18:43] <islandsunn> the casino arc was better than the spacebattle shit

[1:23:59] <+RealThiele> the lighthouse is amazing too
[1:23:59] <+Bailey__gaming> have i missed any bosses?
[1:24:01] <+SomeSageAdvice> im kinda stunned that like, Paige is getting a bunch of superarmor from her attacks and not getting staggered
[1:24:05] <TheEndlessRiver1> Heres the quote: “Our characters, in the movie The Man Who Killed Don Quixote, had to be physically close. I considered the actor’s behavior to be rude because, in the preparation of a scene, he didn’t take the care I believe he should have taken. Our characters had to be physically close and, every time he stood up with the force of the character to do the rest of the scene, the chair in which he was sitting would bump into me with some force, which bothered me.”
[1:24:05] <QueequegTheater> His co-star in an upcoming movie is accusing him of being a cunt
[1:24:08] <derap41> Here's a lesson for you all don't imagine people are ever nice

[1:24:23] <%BinaryFireball> Well, turns out, the performer is retracting some of her claims, admitting she was “venting” and “had no intention to bring any harm” to Adam’s reputation
[1:24:27] <TurtlesAndTentacles> Paige is Swing twice when she already kills them in once.....is she blind blind?

[1:24:53] <+SomeSageAdvice> im sure if you asked anyone about any actor, they would always say they're a jerkass
[1:24:53] <Psyramics> It's not true, that's a mistranslation, just every time he jumped out of the chair as part of the scene, it would bump into her
[1:24:53] <%BoxNavy> yeah
[1:24:54] <redstonej> adam driver said ok boomer
[1:24:55] <user_naim> Pat how does the Don Qui song in Yakuza go?

[1:37:38] <peachy996> Good job Crazy Talk
[1:37:38] <+OwlLightningMage> It was probably Pat
[1:37:39] <%Mr_Pylon> it was the style at the time
[1:37:42] <%Promessa_EX> there hasn't been much exploration
[1:37:44] <%Massimoman64> in the game too
[1:37:45] <Jetsfantasy> It was Pat blaming Plague
[1:37:46] <reyntime180> Flynns gives more attack the less load you have
[1:37:46] <$cade_calrayn> Pat, I'm pretty sure he said "Sure Paige put that on" when she asked about the new rings she found
[1:37:47] <%Promessa_EX> just lots of dying
[1:37:48] <+logoth_> just use a moss
[1:37:49] <+Taisuru> I mean, poison is hardly anything

[1:38:49] <SpaceManHotepIV> make butter
[1:38:49] <+OwlLightningMage> Bolder Heave is legit amazing
[1:38:51] <%Promessa_EX> if she's over 30% might as well be 70%
[1:38:52] <%KeiganOfAstora> That's the Ashen Estus Ring
[1:38:53] <syanplague> havel ring is not from a boss soul?
[1:38:54] <%mousesorcerer> herhehehehehe

[1:39:12] <%Too_Much_Nukie> Yeah technically. But you can just not get poisoned.
[1:39:18] <+Taisuru> It makes it last longer but gives you more time to get not poisoned
[1:39:21] <%LiquidDinosaur> i fucking hate the enemies here
[1:39:27] <coreyyotto> this place is just south florida isn't it
[1:39:28] <%LiquidDinosaur> i hate these enemies worse than i hate brainsuckers

[1:43:41] <$SirGO0SE> I didn't know that
[1:43:41] <+OwlLightningMage> I forgot about Paige not knowing about trains LUL
[1:43:44] <+patriotrenegade> Pat had to say something on the spot the difference

[1:44:13] <+Grayhammatter> HOW
[1:44:14] <Pookiedaexzile> You see women are bad at directions which is why they are called Traiblazers so much.
[1:44:14] <+Taisuru> BUY THE GLASSES
[1:44:15] <%KeiganOfAstora> @PeachSaliva Look at the stone relief above the fire. Each one is one of the Great Lords from Dark Souls1

[1:44:22] <traitorousturncoat> Good, that's what yoou do with contacts
[1:44:24] <%Zeif00> Just don't forget to take those contacts out
[1:44:24] <%xmetalicdemonx> at a snails pce
[1:44:25] <+tigerfang86> HONK
[1:44:26] <%BoxNavy> you have to buy the glasses
[1:44:26] <+Taisuru> Oh boy contacts, even easier to lose
[1:44:28] <+crazyspartan214> go back
[1:44:28] <peachy996> You cannot handle contacts
[1:44:28] <%xmetalicdemonx> pace
[1:44:28] <$SirGO0SE> you're just quoting yourself form 2017 now Paige
[1:44:30] <cyclog> @PeachSaliva What about laser surgery ?
[1:44:32] <+toastybites> INB4 Paige forgets to take out her contacts and they fuse to her cornea
[1:44:32] <%Promessa_EX> paige you would totally fall assleep with contacts on
[1:44:33] <samcast1> g'doi
[1:44:36] <syanplague> how long are we talking about glasses with Paige?
[1:44:36] <%mousesorcerer> sipsipSipsipblind sipsipSipsipblind sipsipSipsipblind
[1:44:37] <%Ranryu692> Paige can you just tell us how much it would cost to get like, 5 pairs of glasses and we'll crowd fund them for you? lol
[1:44:40] <Laecerelius> Paige hates being able to see
[1:44:41] <OldManDeckardCain> jesus christ, pat's accent wandered more than that guy's that play mad max LUL
[1:44:42] <+OwlLightningMage> Paige's definition of progress is very wrong
[1:44:44] <%KeiganOfAstora> The important one holy shit
[1:44:46] <peachy996> You will lose Contacts THE INSTANT you get them because you're you
[1:44:46] <%KeiganOfAstora> wow
[1:44:46] <syanplague> i fell like that been forever

[1:58:30] <QueequegTheater> @PeachSaliva Hey remember how in DS2 nobody even remembers any names because of how incredibly long it's been since DS1, and DS3 takes place at least 4,000 years after DS2, but there are incredibly accurate and detailed bas reliefs for the three lords from DS1? But don't worry, DS3 isn't top-to-bottom shallow fanservice or anything KappaHD
[1:58:30] <+OwlLightningMage> Bolder Heave time

[2:00:35] <+MegaCorpltd> DS2 had better thought out lore than 3. Fite me.
[2:00:38] <%KeiganOfAstora> Is that Sif?!?!?!
[2:00:39] <Essixian> DS2 is flawed but charming and if you disagree I will be mildly annoyed for like a second and then move on

[2:01:17] <SMuffinMan> 2 is fucking garbage the cap in this chat I swear
[2:01:19] <dizimous> Using existing lore from your franchise is not fanservice you dots
[2:01:22] <$Sphincter_Spelunker> @PanicSwytch BRUH. I'm in this photo and I don't like it. I'm sweatin right now LUL

[2:01:31] <QueequegTheater> Lucatiel is better than Solaire. Evidence: Lucatiel has a cool hat, Solaire has no hat
[2:01:32] <Jaysky> DS2 is the weakest of the games imo. It's way too long for it's own good and a SOTF made it worse, and also has the worst bosses overall.
[2:01:32] <%Promessa_EX> SASAGEYO
[2:01:35] <weissguard> Chat's being smelly and talking about which Soulsborne game is the best (again)

[2:03:01] <Coystick> Now it is time for Zangief Demon
[2:03:09] <+patriotrenegade> there u can see through the world
[2:03:11] <+OwlLightningMage> Elden Ring will be cool though, right?
[2:03:11] <%AncelDeLambert> no it isn't, look up and there's the castle, also, look around and theres the village
[2:03:11] <QueequegTheater> @superc37 No, ten mediocre bosses than one boring one. SoC literally has no unique moves, it's just recycled player movesets
[2:03:12] <peachy996> Yeah it's fun in Bloodborne
[2:03:13] <%AncelDeLambert> KILLLLLL!
[2:03:15] <Jaysky> Why would you prefer the twirling grim reaper who does nothing but curse over the boss that uses numerous playstyles and a call back?
[2:03:18] <+OwlLightningMage> Elden Ring
[2:03:19] <%BoxNavy> remember dark souls 1?
[2:03:19] <+Grayhammatter> time for kill
[2:03:23] <%AncelDeLambert> Bloodborne I feel doesn't do it enough
[2:03:28] <naoi0> No cam?
[2:03:28] <%KeiganOfAstora> No, it's just to give you a cool visual and sometimes the actual game world doesn't line up so they had to "move things"
[2:03:29] <$SirGO0SE> friend :)
[2:03:29] <QueequegTheater> HEY MEMBER DS1
[2:03:30] <+cdrom321> Hey. We don't have to go back to the cathedral just yet. That's cool.
[2:03:30] <peachy996> You see Old Yharnam from all sorts of vantage points
[2:03:30] <+OwlLightningMage> Everyone agree about Elden Ring
[2:03:31] <+YabbaTroll> time is convoluted
[2:03:39] <CanadianAnimatorGuy> If you drop your souls you can see them in that area across the world though, which is cool
[2:03:42] <%AncelDeLambert> there's not enough distinction between buildings in Bloodborne to truly orient yourself
[2:03:43] <mrjplays2k9> This is less far than I was expecting
[2:03:45] <Finakala> Nashandra literally has 3 moves and they're all nothing
[2:03:45] <+Taisuru> @YabbaTroll And distance is bullshit

[2:08:13] <%dekkitout> Pretty sure one of the scientists in covenant went "WTF don't do that!!!"
[2:08:13] <krabthecrab> Prometheus expects too much of its audience considering how boring it is
[2:08:15] <phantalime> A guy finds alien spores in that movie and sniffs them
[2:08:15] <tacostarvedbeast> the planet is breathable, 'time to use my travel size shower and get naked around these weird eggs"
[2:08:16] <%superc37> im starting to think *anyone* who says ds2 is better just straight like quantity instead of quality

[2:08:21] <$Tredecian> thats the horror, stupid people. what really scary is that they arent limited to movies

[2:08:43] <+tigerfang86> SO OLD
[2:08:43] <mrjplays2k9> in covenant a scientist thinks its a good idea to just smoke a cig on an alien planet
[2:08:44] <+OwlLightningMage> Elden Ring though
[2:08:46] <+tigerfang86> they're BIG OLD
[2:08:46] <%king_wragles> That said, I'm waiting for the one idiot to somehow get leprosy back into the lime light by being an idiot
[2:08:47] <+captain_thickthighs> this why you need osha in space
[2:08:48] <ARDM112> Prothemeus but especially Covenant would be vastly improved by not having anything to do with Alien or xenomorphs
[2:08:51] <%valriot> Why didn't they just use the android telling them the air was clean to explain that NotLikeThis
[2:08:54] <clockworkidiot> They're crusty

[2:09:22] <markdreizehn> In hindsight, them taking off their helmets in Prothemeus and Covenant make much more sense when you consider how Americans have treated the Covid situation and how HARD IT IS to literally get them to wear masks

[2:35:36] <%superc37> "paige just hit him"
[2:35:40] <YakumoYomi> Your weapon is huge, and it staggers them
[2:35:41] <TurtlesAndTentacles> Paige you are your greatest enemy
[2:35:46] <Murphio_GS> You can beat them because you can actually take the soul, but they can't because it's their soul and they already have it.
[2:35:54] <punishedVagabond> Don't panic stay calm
[2:35:59] <%AtlasMcCoy> But can Paige remember this?
[2:36:08] <+OwlLightningMage> Paige will not remember this
