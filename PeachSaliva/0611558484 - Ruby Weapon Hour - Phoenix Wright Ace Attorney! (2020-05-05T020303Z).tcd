[0:21:58] <$Sphincter_Spelunker> @Noelle_of_the_Nova he proposed in New Zealand mountains, I think
[0:21:58] <%happyface699> Lol
[0:21:59] <@PlagueOfGripes> Put a ring on your dinger
[0:22:00] <%spiritofmojave> WcDonald's hashbrown proposal
[0:22:00] <%Chichen> @PeachSaliva he's gonna hide it in Elmo's bag and tell you to shake his bag
[0:22:01] <+kyh9> It will be a misunderstanding when you receive a ring in your Mcdonalds Kid Meal
[0:22:01] <+StreamStopA> and then you will cry and call your mom
[0:22:01] <%realm_forge> What are the side effects of taking pat?
[0:22:02] <cache_22> "Do I have to?"
[0:22:02] <mrjohncarlton1> You'll just smack Pat and a bunch of SOnic rings will fall out
[0:22:04] <CaptHat211> HINT HINT, PAT. BE CREATIVE.
[0:22:04] <filialpails> "Will you settle?"
[0:22:04] <j0ustar> He'll put the ring on top of a McD patty
[0:22:08] <kwangalang> Woolie has the flowers from where he proposed
[0:22:09] <%Mornaka> and then you'd cry
[0:22:09] <+BoboDaHobo> wait where is Pat? isn't there a quarantine?
[0:22:09] <ExpressNode> It should just be a ring carved from a bone
[0:22:10] <mechengineers> you ever think of how finger puppet is a really fucked up adjective.
[0:22:10] <Yummy_Nukes> and then you'll go to the weed store and get the dankest of drugs
[0:22:10] <+SergeEXE> LMAO
[0:22:12] <+Estuko> @PeachSaliva if anything I feel like Pat would do something super out of place and confusing to everyone else but specifically special and perfect between you two lol

[0:28:16] <+gambit_gamble> punch the wasp
[0:28:17] <%zamatermort> Wasps are assholes
[0:28:17] <%spiritofmojave> Don't they target honeybee hives more?
[0:28:18] <Zaphire_Saucypants> also these wasps are bad all around

[0:28:20] <%nofestu2> *hates
[0:28:20] <Dhurkst> NOT THE BEES
[0:28:22] <$TIME_PUNCHER> Paige must HATE Tarantual wasps
[0:28:22] <WaxWitch> a whole can of Raid, eff wasps or anything close to them
[0:28:22] <CptCreampuff16> didnt you eat a bee sandwich?
[0:28:23] <mrjplays2k9> bees are fine, the evep make a woop noise when they bump into eachother
[0:28:23] <+gimmickypizza> Respect the bees
[0:28:24] <%GeneralSCPatton> EDF EDF
[0:28:25] <@Calek> the new wasps are definitely not the bees knees
[0:28:28] <%darcfowler1995> It’s a two Inch long fucking hornet it will fuck your ass up
[0:28:30] <skyentombment> mosquitoes feed spiders and frogs paige
[0:28:33] <+SergeEXE> TO SAVE OUR MOTHER EARTH FROM ANY ALIEN ATTACK
[0:28:34] <%AncelDeLambert> I think Paige missed mine
[0:28:35] <ExpressNode> I have phobia of bees and hornets. I freaked the fuck out at work and I ran inside the building as fast as I could
[0:28:36] <$mister___doctor> The other day I shook a tree and a wasp nest fell out. They stung me right in the eye. I had ran out of medicine too.
[0:28:36] <Paralurx> Paige respects the bees too much to eat the bee sandwich
[0:28:37] <honeyman18> it's called survival
[0:28:37] <%GohanHitsugaya> The only bug I like off the top of my head, is the Ladybug...
[0:28:38] <%heartlesshealer> you have Lupus, you have a free pass for bee fear
[0:28:38] <%ThePuddingDead> @PeachSaliva bees or if and their knees
[0:28:38] <%starotter70> sipsipSipsipblind
[0:28:38] <+DCN2049> Wasps have been scientifically demonstrated as being capable of pure spite.
[0:28:40] <@PlagueOfGripes> You ran from a lot of things
[0:28:41] <%Mornaka> LUL
[0:28:43] <skyentombment> you gonna fuck with mosquitoes like that?
[0:28:43] <ECRead> Genocide the murder hornets
[0:28:44] <RubberFistFight> @PeachSaliva What about bee sandwiches though? Or weaponised uterine bees?
[0:28:44] <%TigerCatGo> LORE
[0:28:44] <atgithursdays> PAIGE stop talking about boring things and tell me how you wash your hair in the shower/bath
[0:28:45] <Meekest> LUL
[0:28:46] <%happyface699> Nice
[0:28:47] <Zaphire_Saucypants> The general advisement for these wasps is to kill on site, cuz they really fuck with everything.
[0:28:48] <+CrimKangaroo> parasitic wasps are nature's biggest a*holes. they sting you and then mind control you and lay their eggs inside
[0:28:48] <%spiritofmojave> WHAT LUL
[0:28:48] <Madbearv> 'why is that man assaulting that woman'
[0:28:49] <%Dementedpenguin> I wasp snuck in my car one time while I was driving and hovered near my face. Almost goddamn crashed
[0:28:50] <+BubbaRands> NO NOT THE BEES
[0:28:50] <%Shonen_hero> I'm pretty bee/wasp phobic
[0:28:50] <%PanicSwytch> I worked an entire shift at my gamestore with a wasp fly around
[0:28:51] <+Dakuu75> this sounds... very paige
[0:28:53] <Nekros4442> @spiritofmojave Yes, It's known just 1 can destroy an entire hive if the bees arent used to delaing with them
[0:28:56] <arcanemacrocosm> running and flailing is litterally the worst thing to do, unless they re specifically attacking you
[0:28:56] <%starotter70> Bee > Car
[0:28:57] <@SoFarFetched> Think Twitch fucked up on sub messages and cheers again.
[0:28:57] <+DCN2049> Wasps will kill their own siblings, just because they can.
[0:28:59] <$Sphincter_Spelunker> @RafflesiaA spotted last year, bee keeper found one hive massacred and someone else found a hornet nest not too far away in the last month
[0:29:01] <Orenjevel> I was spraying for invasive plants with a conservation corps a while back and the guy next to me got CLOWNED by a bunch of yellow jackets it was funny but also horrifying

[0:41:33] <Aleate> Yang is still dead :)
[0:41:33] <%TigerCatGo> GOOD TASTE!!!!!
[0:41:35] <PartyFavors> and 9
[0:41:37] <%Ranryu692> back when Final Fantasy was good
[0:41:37] <%darcfowler1995> Four is the best
[0:41:37] <DXLelouch24> Atleast 6
[0:41:38] <%TigerCatGo> FF9 FOR ME
[0:41:39] <$Skittlesoul> play nine
[0:41:39] <thelonechris> My only experience with FF was FFXV
[0:41:40] <%GohanHitsugaya> I just bought 7 and 8 last night.
[0:41:40] <Quigsies> X is good
[0:41:40] <%Kirby_Sauce> NO7!
[0:41:41] <%supersugoisenpai1> I will simp for 9
[0:41:42] <%heartlesshealer> Minwu was good!
[0:41:42] <+BubbaRands> PLAY 9
[0:41:43] <%afronooch> 6 is great
[0:41:43] <$konekoryugamine> I've only got 7 and 8
[0:41:44] <ScreamLord> I've heard good things about FF9
[0:41:44] <DFireCreations> which version fo 4 tho
[0:41:45] <%emoonimoo> At least 4,6, 7 and 9

[0:41:47] <$Skittlesoul> 9 all day
[0:41:48] <coldfire0007> and 13 if you are feeling brave
[0:41:48] <Yummy_Nukes> WHO IS THE PROTAGONIST OF FF6 THOUGH?!?!?!?
[0:41:48] <+SaphronBlackbourne> I don't really like 4 but I loved 6
[0:41:49] <+NopeBadguy> The PSP version of 4 is the easiest to get into
[0:41:50] <Dhurkst> @ssjklyco He was never dead, apparently
[0:41:50] <%spiritofmojave> SIX IS HELLA GOOD
[0:41:51] <%Ranryu692> DON'T PLAY FFII
[0:41:51] <$konekoryugamine> Which one has Kefka?
[0:41:53] <peyodogo> 8 is incredibly stupid but it's such a good time
[0:41:56] <@SoFarFetched> 6
[0:42:00] <Rhinoprotoss> 6's random encounter rate is fucked
[0:42:00] <+zepelinnn1> 5 is cool too! great job system
[0:42:01] <Prevot> I need a remake of 6 cause I wanna play it but that shit's too old
[0:42:01] <%afronooch> Tactics is the best tho
[0:42:01] <%darcfowler1995> PSP version of four on emulation is pretty good
[0:42:02] <Orenjevel> play the original FFXIV
[0:42:02] <PartyFavors> 6 has Kegka
[0:42:04] <%heartlesshealer> 2 is bad, BUT MINWU
[0:42:08] <DXLelouch24> 4 has a DS version atleast
[0:42:08] <%starotter70> Steam version looks eh
[0:42:09] <PartyFavors> *Kefka
[0:42:10] <GoopyEuclid> Is 4 Spoony Bard?

[0:42:12] <+BubbaRands> UPDATED 3 IS MEH...
[0:42:12] <SpicyVibration> Which is the one where you get to kill God?
[0:42:12] <$konekoryugamine> Ty
[0:42:14] <$Sphincter_Spelunker> I only know about Ninja man and his dog and Sabin Suplexs
[0:42:15] <@PlagueOfGripes> I like the part where they sparkle and swarm around and room to fuck
[0:42:15] <LoneFonte> 6 steam version is fucked, right?
[0:42:18] <%ssjklyco> @Dhurkst at this point, he may as well be.
[0:42:19] <CaptainKarite> I started 7 last night and I just left Midgar
[0:42:20] <ExpressNode> Play FF12. I finished and it and don't remember shit all for the story. Combat is great though
[0:42:21] <XeroSigmaPrime> Which version of 6 is the best? SNES version?
[0:42:21] <T_Sasquatch> i tried, turns out i just dont like turn based games, i reached the shinra building tho
[0:42:22] <%spiritofmojave> Tactics and XII sipsipGasm
[0:42:23] <cureneckbeard> Sir Sabin!
[0:42:24] <zamzoph> oh no, Paige can't read
[0:42:27] <TimetodiveLTX> I CANNOT LIVE, I CANNOT DIE
[0:42:29] <+crimsonharvest> Everyone play the Brave New World mod for FF6
[0:42:35] <@SoFarFetched> @LoneFonte pretty much all the old Final fantasy games on steam are the mobile games.
[0:42:39] <Jetsfantasy> You need to play the SNES or GBA versions. PSX if you can't get those and have it already
[0:42:40] <%emoonimoo> Play 4 so that you can meet Golbez - one of the best FF boys
[0:42:42] <cureneckbeard> Paige likes FF6 the best. No wonder Pat likes her
[0:42:44] <Aydarkzero> planning on playing through 7 for the first time in a decade

If I use my real name, trying to promote it as my own may confuse people on the interwebs...But if I use my internet name then people will definitely find my Twitter and see all the weird pornography in my likes, plus normies might think pseudonyms are pretentious?

[0:44:30] <%ssjklyco> Cid, the 32 year old man with a smoking habit
[0:44:32] <Zaphire_Saucypants> @Bane_Kaikyo That's an important decision. Think of it like this. Come up with something you wouldn't be embarrassed to jot down and autograph with.

[0:47:13] <CaptHat211> Pat will get a Herkimer Diamond
[0:47:13] <indig0bird> Get a nice golden band. They're cute
[0:47:15] <Dhurkst> Diamonds aren't very valuable, scarcity is controlled by cartels
[0:47:16] <%Farples> But will the onion have layers?
[0:47:16] <djblue_shift> like marge sikpson?
[0:47:17] <+neon_island> A RUBY
[0:47:19] <%ssjklyco> An onion engagement ring has layers to it.
[0:47:20] <+thegreenbenis> Do it Paige.
[0:47:20] <%heartlesshealer> Pat is not allowed to eat a ring pop
[0:47:22] <TheWe4pon> Get a kidney stone ring
[0:47:22] <zeif00> A Giant Rhinestoned Onion Wedding Ring
[0:47:24] <Nekros4442> Just get a Black band imo
[0:47:24] <%TheMattman1313> Pat has to get you a new one every few weeks or so. It symbolizes the commitment!
[0:47:26] <+badchoice5> Canadian Police Bots roam the streets maintaining quarantine
[0:47:28] <%ShichiNoBushi> I think other gemstones are cooler than diamonds like sapphires or rubies.
[0:47:28] <Dhurkst> RUBY WEAPON
[0:47:30] <Echlir> Pat would give you an onion ring and then your'd break a tooth on the diamond ring inside
[0:47:31] <%XeroSigmaPrime> @Sphincter_Spelunker WHY THE FUCK WOULD IT NEED TO BE CLEANED?! ITS NOT A VACUUM OR SOME SHIT
[0:47:33] <TheShockVox> Now I’m gonna parasocial and assume we’re best friends!
[0:47:36] <+dylin456> just do the tattoo band
[0:47:37] <Orenjevel> C'mon, its the obviously correct choice
[0:47:39] <%Alopekis> Chaos Emerald
[0:47:40] <%Ranryu692> it'll be a dorito on a twist tie #gamerz
[0:47:40] <$Hylian726> RUBY WEAPON RING
[0:47:40] <%Binary_Fireball> IS IT THE TIME TO GAME!?
[0:47:42] <Mogel56> Blood Pearl ring
[0:47:44] <Yummy_Nukes> a big THICC ASS RUBY
[0:47:45] <%heartlesshealer> he licc
[0:47:47] <%sleepy_coffee> Haha Emlo likes to stare at your hands
[0:47:47] <%starotter70> @XeroSigmaPrime Wait, are you also the one who cut their own tongue?
[0:47:48] <+neon_island> Pat take notes my man
[0:47:51] <witchybrew> i feel like a partnet who would give me a ruby ring would HAVE to be a pirate and i am down for that.
[0:47:51] <$Jumpie8> pearls are nice and fancy
[0:47:51] <%Quack_of_Dawn> It was me getting my sub out of the way
[0:47:52] <%Binary_Fireball> of course not haha
[0:47:54] <Laironx3> what about one of those candy rings? LuvPeekR
[0:47:55] <witchybrew> partner**

[0:47:59] <+badchoice5> Gold ring
[0:47:59] <SweetCuppingCake> Wait, did I miss something? Are you guys finally engaged?
[0:48:03] <GoopyEuclid> GoopyEuclid subscribed with Twitch Prime. They've subscribed for 2 months! Hi Peach! As someone who's neuroatypical (very probably at least), your and Pat streams are extremely validating. GL on the stream!
[0:48:05] <indig0bird> I don't understand the people who want a natural diamond which is likely the product of slavery
[0:48:09] <%heartlesshealer> s p e e d
[0:48:09] <%spiritofmojave> Housing market monkaS
[0:48:12] <j0ustar> LIES
[0:48:14] <Shwepie> Has consumerism taught you nothing? You must demand the biggest and most expensive diamond, nothing else.
[0:48:15] <cureneckbeard> gotta go fast
[0:48:15] <%XeroSigmaPrime> @starotter70 ...maybe... I prefer the title of "licks knifes for the extra juice flavor on it"
[0:48:16] <$Sphincter_Spelunker> @XeroSigmaPrime Where do you think loose hair and lint goes? FailFish
[0:48:17] <%Kirby_Sauce> Ciao bella
[0:48:17] <%ryome> Make Pat get a materia bangle for you
[0:48:18] <+NWR_James> YET
[0:48:22] <j0ustar> 2nd date
[0:48:23] <%heartlesshealer> he did
[0:48:24] <LenDawsonsFresca> rubies are actually worth more than diamonds when you take into account the artificial scarcity pushed by De Biers
[0:48:25] <SpicyVibration> Pop the question Paige, you can do it!
[0:48:29] <T_Sasquatch> yet
[0:48:30] <mMayrro> LUL what a loser
[0:48:30] <%heartlesshealer> it was a sweet story
[0:48:31] <+Saggitori> wait are yall getting married for real
[0:48:31] <witchybrew> he knew.
[0:48:32] <%starotter70> @XeroSigmaPrime NotLikeThis
[0:48:32] <%Alopekis> That’s always hilarious
[0:48:33] <%spiritofmojave> LUL
[0:48:33] <+thegreenbenis> That's kinda adorable
[0:48:34] <+kyh9> And then you said "No way, friend"

[0:48:43] <$Solidnick18> Oh
[0:48:43] <Yummy_Nukes> AWWW
[0:48:43] <%darcfowler1995> It’s because he found someone great and wanted to lock it down before he lost it
[0:48:45] <Megaleg> oh shit it was last wee
[0:48:45] <%ShichiNoBushi> A ruby or sapphire shouldn't chip too much more easily than a diamond since they are both corundums which are just the next step below diamonds on the Moh's scale.
[0:48:47] <$Hylian726> it's a standing offer I assume
[0:48:47] <+NWR_James> @PeachSaliva Pat already told us he's going to do it during one of your streams to see you have a breakdown.
[0:48:48] <ExpressNode> Little quick to the trigger there
[0:48:49] <%Alopekis> He’ll always remember
[0:48:49] <%Clundy> They’re always engaged in friendly combat

[0:49:16] <+gimmickypizza> Elmo stream
[0:49:17] <$Sphincter_Spelunker> @XeroSigmaPrime Gonna be honest, I'm more upset how common not knowing about the lint trap is. This is like the 3rd time I've heard someone do that...

[0:49:31] <$duckmeat_woohoo> lol what is elmo looking at
[0:49:34] <cureneckbeard> I know a guy who proposed to his girlfriend over breakfast as a joke, but by the time he told her it was a joke, she had already called her parents, so he had to go through with it. They have two kids now
[0:49:39] <%heartlesshealer> he just baby

[0:50:00] <%SilvaChariot0133> Elmo Read the script
[0:50:01] <Nekros4442> THATS AMAZING

[0:50:15] <$Solidnick18> floop
[0:50:15] <Tersalus> its the LOOOONGEST CON
[0:50:16] <%starotter70> Accidental Shotgun Wedding
[0:50:16] <%TigerCatGo> WEAR THAT FARMER DIRTY OVERALLS
[0:50:16] <@PlagueOfGripes> "I fathered two children, as a joke."
[0:50:18] <indig0bird> Oh, taht's really cute
[0:50:20] <%TigerCatGo> OVERALL DRESS*
[0:50:23] <%XeroSigmaPrime> @Sphincter_Spelunker Yea its fucking crazy. Its nearly impossible to see the removable filter too.
[0:50:26] <Rhinoprotoss> Make Pat wear a flowy dress
[0:50:27] <%heartlesshealer> dresses are cool
[0:50:27] <skyentombment> Man, my gf and I were having a peetzer, and she had a very paige-like moment of "No, give me the other slice, this one doesn't have enough pepperonis! No not that one, it has too many!"
[0:50:29] <+Kise77> But a dress is fitting for Ace Attorney
[0:50:31] <+Kise77> gotta be fashionable
[0:50:34] <VritraReiRei> "I AM A GENIUS!!!" *minutes later* "OH NO"
[0:50:34] <+caffienatedjedi> Gotta go for the long con
[0:50:35] <goose_attack_almanac> My dad proposed to my mom on April Fools day, and she threatened to throw him out a window
[0:50:36] <+ShadowArcangel> Fathering two children is the longest con
[0:50:52] <%spiritofmojave> My children are jokes to me! just like my marriage WOAH HEY
[0:50:53] <Yummy_Nukes> but what if its 90 degrees outside?
[0:50:56] <%AncelDeLambert> ice or no ice depends on the whiskey
[0:51:00] <%ssjklyco> That sounds neat
[0:51:00] <%darcfowler1995> The real long con is sitting in your chair as an old man going ha ha I am the greatest prankster to ever live
[0:51:01] <+WingBuffet> depends on context — fountain soda has extra syrup and is balanced to taste good with ice, too strong otherwise
[0:51:02] <+UberWolfman> THE BABY!!!
[0:51:02] <$Agami23> get a cold rock to put in the drink
[0:51:03] <%nofestu2> what?

[0:51:19] <%TheSniperJoe> Whiskey Stones are great.
[0:51:20] <$Solidnick18> noice
[0:51:21] <%ShichiNoBushi> Banned from bar for crying too much.
[0:51:22] <%AncelDeLambert> you can't just say "NO ICE, IT'S WRONG!" because some whiskey needs to be watered down
[0:51:26] <Laironx3> PogChamp

[0:51:31] <%Binary_Fireball> Japanese whiskey neat is my favorite classy drink
[0:51:34] <ECRead> whiskey stones are great
[0:51:34] <LenDawsonsFresca> I don't like to get whiskey with anything in it the first time I drink that bottle
[0:51:34] <%GeneralSCPatton> There's nothing like a cold one. Even a cool one can be nice on a hot day. But a warm one is hardly even a one at all.
[0:51:36] <j0ustar> Neo levels of doging here
[0:51:48] <+Kise77> @PeachSaliva if you don't get new glasses once this is over we're all gonna riot

[0:51:52] <Rabbi_Hyman_Krustofsky> I swear, the last 4 years have ruined red hats. I always think the first upon first glance of a red hat, even with someone as not-bullshit as yourself
[0:51:52] <%nofestu2> n9
[0:51:52] <SomersaultJustice> that's not true
[0:51:54] <%nofestu2> no
[0:51:55] <%Ranryu692> no
[0:51:57] <cosmictrashcan> nah
[0:51:59] <%starotter70> Nah
[0:51:59] <Orenjevel> i've had majority mediocre teachers
[0:51:59] <ShadeTheNovice> no ive had plenty of mediocre teachers
[0:52:00] <Rabbi_Hyman_Krustofsky> the worst*
[0:52:00] <Quigsies> I'd say most are bad
[0:52:00] <%heartlesshealer> they're either great or they suck with no inbetween in memory vision
[0:52:00] <%Binary_Fireball> nope
[0:52:02] <LenDawsonsFresca> though bourbon on the rocks is wonderful in the summer

[0:52:05] <%SailingSaturn> @Toynota10 sipsipHellmo cirPat
[0:52:05] <$Sphincter_Spelunker> I had a teacher pretend to not realize the high school boys were not staring at her giant boobs
[0:52:05] <TimetodiveLTX> there are plenty of mediocre teachers!
[0:52:06] <%spiritofmojave> I don't think so, I've had meh teachers
[0:52:06] <%RafflesiaA> To be fair, it's hard on them too because, as stated, not trained for it.
[0:52:06] <$Solidnick18> i know some...
[0:52:06] <@Calek> all my teachers just existed then I graduated
[0:52:07] <Aleate> All of my teachers had been meh
[0:52:07] <%starotter70> It's your Stand Paige
[0:52:08] <Koopardon> Oh, I just came here, did I miss anything?
[0:52:09] <arcanemacrocosm> my mother was a teacher
[0:52:10] <thelonechris> I had an alcoholic teacher in 3rd grade
[0:52:10] <j0ustar> Teachers need to be obligated to KNOW how to use tech at this point.
[0:52:11] <%zamatermort> Nah, the mediocre ones just aren't memorable
[0:52:12] <smargh1015> no you just forget the mediocre ones
[0:52:13] <EASrake> Survivorship bias, no one talks about mediocre teachers
[0:52:13] <%darcfowler1995> Yeah I have a really bad Teacher story when I was a little kid one of the teachers told me that I was useless and left me crying in a corner
[0:52:14] <%JimmyRuss> You just forget the middle of the road ones
[0:52:14] <%ssjklyco> Why would they tell you that?
[0:52:14] <%WackyGear> @PeachSaliva the worst are the ones that teach bad but are nice people because you feel bad hating them.
[0:52:15] <%JJCheeker> JJCheeker subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 41 months, currently on a 41 month streak! Hello tonight Paige! Cheers to 41! Ur swell and so is Elmo! I wish I could give his pee covered body a Hug but I live in the states... please give him one for me! <3 sipsipElmo
[0:52:17] <lilferniee> honestly i kinda agree to that
[0:52:18] <%TigerCatGo> Wait, so you were an English-Teacher in Japan afterall?? :O
[0:52:18] <TimetodiveLTX> i've only had one really bad experience
[0:52:18] <$R3Roundabout> you don't remember the mediocre teachers
[0:52:20] <%atgithursdays> I have been given a chat
[0:52:21] <%XeroSigmaPrime> @GeneralSCPatton ...I like warm whiskey... Like I pop it in the microwave for 2 seconds warm...
[0:52:21] <jwhoff619> I’ve had some forgettable ass teachers
[0:52:22] <@PlagueOfGripes> all teachers are mediocre in some fashion. that's why they teach children
[0:52:22] <%atgithursdays> thanks
[0:52:22] <ExpressNode> !uptime
[0:52:23] <TimetodiveLTX> i'm not a physicist
[0:52:23] <Spydurman> your english teachers vs your math teachers?
[0:52:23] <+caffienatedjedi> One of my favorite teachers wasn't really that great of a teacher, he was just one of the guys in after school clubs.
[0:52:27] <cosmictrashcan> i feel like every single one of my teachers was mediocre lmao
[0:52:32] <Aleate> All except that one teacher who destroyed our Computer Lab because someone wrote a slur on his stool.
[0:52:35] <%heartlesshealer> yeah, memory vision erases the mediums
[0:52:37] <Koopardon> Hello, Paige and Elmo!!
[0:52:37] <LightningLynx89> I’ve only had one really bad teacher
[0:52:38] <%nofestu2> oh no
[0:52:39] <+tasty_snack7> because of your sparkling personality
[0:52:40] <%spiritofmojave> Yep, especially collegr
[0:52:41] <@SoFarFetched> no but do it though.
[0:52:42] <ccdrchau> This isn't real online teaching, even remotely close, real online courses are curated take two years to be set in properly and take hours of development time. This is emergency teaching and teacher's trying to salvage the best out of a global pandemic.
[0:52:42] <%deafmutelaughing> it's so tasty
[0:52:43] <ShadeTheNovice> no do it more
[0:52:43] <iosephe> CONSUME MIC
[0:52:44] <%starotter70> But your hungry?
[0:52:44] <%heartlesshealer> hungry Paige
[0:52:45] <rajathene> There was that time a teacher made me cry...

[0:52:52] <Chimeraelite> Nah, no one is amazing (except for my ol' track coach) and no one is horrible. Just varying levels of solid and annoying with a few exceptions

[1:56:32] <Level10Biscuit> So. You've chosen death.
[1:56:33] <+Kduff89> worst thing to do literally ever
[1:56:35] <%velemi> I mean a defense attorney could do it
[1:56:38] <katocrimson> joe exotic also defended himself
[1:56:38] <+Jaysky> But he's a defense attorney
[1:56:42] <%Keyd00d> Well I mean in this specific situation
[1:56:42] <%Alopekis> Always defend yourself
[1:56:44] <+gutlesscoward> yeah, phoenix is only doing this since he's screwed anyways
[1:56:46] <Hellarussian> uh oh
[1:56:47] <$NitronStreams> "anyone who defends themself has a fool for a client"
[1:56:50] <Monkeyweed21> EVEN LAWYERS DONT DEFEND THEMSELVES
[1:56:52] <+bear_breaker20> i would, it would be a fun argument
[1:56:52] <%Keyd00d> They were going to get him a rigged guy
[1:56:52] <%ssjklyco> Single Male Lawyer, fighting for just cause
[1:56:53] <+NWR_James> I mean all the lawyers refused to defend him
[1:56:55] <%RafflesiaA> It's absolutely a thing you are allowed to do but it's the worst idea 99% of the time
[1:56:55] <$correctedsun117> Honestly, even defense attorney's benefit from an additional lawyer
[1:56:56] <ScreamLord> CRUNCH CRUNCH CRUNCH
[1:56:57] <%ThePuddingDead> rabble rabble rabble rabble

[1:57:00] <RegalNoodle> rabble rabble rabble
[1:57:00] <Dragon_Batman> I mean if every defense attorney will be paid to make him guilty he has no choice
[1:57:02] <filialpails> peas and carrots peas and carrots
[1:57:03] <+NeonLight> White even said the lawyer he'd be stuck with would barely be able to count
[1:57:05] <indig0bird> It's the worst thing that you can do but literally every single other lawyer is in Redd's pocket
[1:57:07] <Quigsies> psaRaffle psaRaffle psaRaffle
[1:57:09] <%Alopekis> If you don’t defend yourself in court, you’re just a coward who needs others to fight your battles for you.
[1:57:09] <+OneThousandTomatoes> defend yourself if you can't actually get a lawyer
[1:57:10] <+Kduff89> edgy so hot
[1:57:11] <lotharrio> They're making Wright defend himself?

[2:18:14] <hzealot> press is a free action

[2:27:24] <Prevot> you fell for one of the classic blunders
[2:27:24] <PartyFavors> I love you Edgeworth
[2:27:25] <$StaceMcGate> Shouldn't this get Edgeworth disbarred for incriminating his witness?
[2:27:29] <+CrimKangaroo> leading the damn witness, you're honour!
[2:27:30] <%heartlesshealer> "When the autopsy report gets updated"
[2:27:31] <%DesuDesuDokiDoki> edgeworth is such a guilty motherfucker
[2:27:31] <indig0bird> He's literally trying to get his childhood friend killed
[2:27:33] <Jetssam> nah, japan law
[2:27:34] <$Sphincter_Spelunker> totally not leading the witness
[2:27:34] <lotharrio> Edgeworth is trying to book him for blackmail and tear apart BlueCorp, I guess?
[2:27:35] <$thomassolorio> lies all lies
[2:27:35] <PartyFavors> Anime Law
[2:27:36] <prophetdisharmonious> It's possible Edgeworth actually believes this, but yeah he's kinda a bitch boy
[2:27:36] <RubberFistFight> I would hate to live in this world, the legal system here is even more nonsensical than it is in reality.
[2:27:36] <+trippersigs22> I forgot how much of an absolute shit Edgeworth used to be.
[2:27:37] <Jetssam> is gud
[2:27:39] <%Th3SmartAlec> YOU CAN'T GIVE HIS TESTOMONY FOR HIM
[2:27:40] <+CrimKangaroo> *your
[2:27:41] <weissguard> @StaceMcGate Anime Court Land, remember?
[2:27:42] <SpicyVibration> edgeworth just casually committing perjury
[2:27:43] <Djinnazz> that's called purgery
[2:27:43] <Jetsfantasy> ANYTHING for a guilty verdict
[2:27:44] <BlacSoul> PURGERY IS ALSO A FELONY
[2:27:45] <+driemen> Japan law
[2:27:47] <garbageheaphound> what a scumbag i love it
[2:27:48] <+Yakobro> @StaceMcGate the only law here is anime!
[2:27:50] <RubberFistFight> FUCKING
[2:27:52] <+lethallunacyx> Isn't that fucker the prosecution, why the fuck is he creating a defense for that bastard?
[2:27:52] <j0ustar> So the Witness was lying from the start you say? WHAT CREDIBILITY!!!
[2:27:52] <RubberFistFight> LEADING THE WITNESS
[2:27:52] <%spiritofmojave> Edgeworth damn you you hot, snide, cold bitch
[2:27:52] <@PlagueOfGripes> like 90% of the shit going on in this game would result in jail time for everyone involved

[2:27:58] <Jetssam> he wasn't sworn in, he's not perjuring. :)
[2:27:59] <%AncelDeLambert> Edgeworth in here like fucking Orochimaru, and Phoenix forgives him like fucking Naruto
[2:27:59] <T_Sasquatch> didnt he literally say that his girl did it alone LUL

[2:28:01] <$correctedsun117> BIG PURGERY
[2:28:01] <$Gr4ndm4rsh4ll> OBJECTION: Leading the witness!
[2:28:01] <%lewdskeletor13> It’s anime law
[2:28:05] <GarbageQueenEllie> The only reason Edgeworth still has a job is because everyone in the Justice Dept is a negligent asshole
[2:28:07] <indig0bird> @PlagueOfGripes You're 10% wrong
[2:28:08] <+kyh9> New mission: KILL MILSE
[2:28:08] <+trippersigs22> @blacsoul id rather be convicted of that than murder.....
[2:28:09] <countgaculatv> This is super illegal
[2:28:09] <mrjohncarlton1> And to think among the Prosecutors Edgeworth is the "softie"
[2:28:10] <DrFaustMD> This is Japan lae
[2:28:11] <%mister___doctor> "Hey Phoenix, remember the time I tried to have you killed"

[2:31:24] <MayorRev> There was a game where you played as Edgeworth right? Is your objective still to prove people guilty in that one?
[2:31:26] <%ThePuddingDead> corrupt is not how u spell incompetent
[2:31:28] <Jetssam> judge is a new grad
[2:31:30] <+OneThousandTomatoes> oh, you got to the part where Edgeworth is helping you
[2:31:30] <goose_attack_almanac> WHICH IS SUPER ILLEGAL
[2:31:30] <HitchhikingThrough> holdit emote when
[2:31:30] <%Supermonaman> I love how much on a satire this series is of Japan's legal system.

[2:31:49] <Void_The_Dark> @MayorRev nah. It's more of a detective game. you're never really in court

[2:32:25] <+Ancopro> uhoh
[2:32:26] <PartyFavors> yeah Edgeworth has two spinoffs. You basically investigate crimes on scene, and you find the culprit by effectively doing the court segments outside of court to nail down the person who you will (offscreen) be trying for the crime.
[2:32:26] <%AncelDeLambert> @PeachSaliva you're fine
