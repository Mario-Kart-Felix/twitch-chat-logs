[0:18:20] <@SoFarFetched> yeah best not to Paige.
[0:18:24] <@SoFarFetched> cause you'd have to add people
[0:18:26] <+QueequegTheater> @PeachSaliva You don't trust me Kappa
[0:18:32] <%ComfortableStranger> I can take a hint
[0:18:40] <%Treuan> Yeah DBD has a separate friend list but you would need to add them there
[0:18:40] <%superc37> fair
[0:18:45] <nivlac_555> probably best not to
[0:18:46] <Skatedeandre> nah hes right

[0:18:50] <%ItalianWaifu> Don't talk to strangers
[0:18:51] <KCfusecoast> I‚Äôm concerned over the extra packs and what the best way to play with the packs available like Silent Hill or Resident Evil or Halloween and Saw
[0:18:55] <@SoFarFetched> so that's probably why pat is telling you not to.
[0:19:02] <phantomsleeves> i find solo queue is faster at night vs party queue at night personally

[0:19:34] <lilachysteria> we can hear him from downstairs lmfaooo
[0:19:34] <nightmarescarecrow> is the heatwave bad in Canada?
[0:19:36] <marvel877> He's streaming and we can hear him
[0:19:40] <+QueequegTheater> PogChamp
[0:19:50] <+LegendGHT> Nice room. When did you start streaming in here?
[0:19:54] <%SilvaChariot0133> psaDogchamp
[0:19:57] <Skatedeandre> are those peaches on ur idk what u call that
[0:19:59] <Arancet> but thats your whole life now, ought to be used to it
[0:20:00] <$JoshManVGH> The ambiance
[0:20:06] <%Treuan> Sweet music
[0:20:06] <%superc37> @KCfusecoast the only dlc you NEED for survivor is the halloween one imo bc the survivor it comes with, lurie, has the best perk in the game
[0:20:07] <%SilvaChariot0133> LUL
[0:20:08] <$NitronStreams> *offscreen streamer noises*
[0:20:08] <%ItalianWaifu> has Pat ever intruded on a zoom meeting?
[0:20:11] <lilachysteria> i love the pat ambience
[0:20:12] <@CreepyPorpoise> why was there a question mark
[0:20:14] <NeonBleu> the theme song of the house
[0:20:14] <%superc37> laurie*
[0:20:17] <+QueequegTheater> I can't stand wearing headphones and I play on console, it feels like double hardmode
[0:20:22] <Ozavic> Hey Peach, going to make my pathfinder character while I watch your stream. He's an orc shaman boy and I already love him
[0:20:24] <%SveriSageAdvice> lmao the inquisitive "love you too?"
[0:20:25] <%Ranryu692> you said " the music" right as a character on his screen started dancing
[0:20:26] <mike2hands> LOVE IS BEYOND NORMAL VOLUME
[0:20:35] <+QueequegTheater> @PeachSaliva Do you think there will ever be a rework or buff for Pig
[0:20:40] <%AncelDeLambert> BURN HER!
[0:20:45] <%walternatorz> evil witch vibes
[0:20:50] <%superc37> never
[0:20:58] <%superc37> she will always be terrible
[0:21:02] <phantomsleeves> paige are you gonna try killer during the anniversary
[0:21:08] <@SoFarFetched> nah you're all good geefPlz
[0:21:11] <%SveriSageAdvice> i dont hear very much stuttering?
[0:21:14] <%SveriSageAdvice> you're fine
[0:21:19] <+QueequegTheater> @superc37 :(
[0:21:24] <radda343> I can never get her stealth thing to actually work
[0:21:40] <%ComfortableStranger> @PeachSaliva is there a reason we never see you playing against pyramid head
[0:21:52] <+goose_attack_almanac> Hi Paige. I like the arm scrunchie
[0:21:56] <@ckbooks> I've fallen in love with Hag.
[0:21:57] <%ospreyworks> ospreyworks subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 8 months! Happy 8 Months, Peach! And Happy 5 Years to DbD! Given the chance and all the support and supplies necessary, which killer would you cosplay as?
[0:22:00] <phantomsleeves> there are some terrible spirit players though
[0:22:03] <Quiet__Viking> many people dislike spirit
[0:22:04] <%superc37> yeah thats p much the common consensus
[0:22:05] <+QueequegTheater> Good Spirit is like good Nurse but feels less fair
[0:22:07] <Ziegsy> INC RAID
[0:22:07] <@SoFarFetched> @ComfortableStranger because that really depends on who she's queueing up with on whether or not they play Pyramid Head.
[0:22:17] <%SilvaChariot0133> Ready your swords nyannRaid
[0:22:17] <nightmarescarecrow> my go to is the clown
[0:22:25] <Faustgesicht> How's The Plague doing?
[0:22:33] <%ComfortableStranger> @SoFarFetched just seems like we've seen every other killer
[0:22:37] <theKingRamses> what about blight mains
[0:22:39] <+QueequegTheater> I play on controller, Nurse is literally impossible for me
[0:22:40] <$thomassolorio> paige whats your favorit whisky
[0:22:42] <+Mendin> Spirit needing a nerf is probably the least controvertial killer statement you can made afte "please buff Clown"
[0:22:44] <@SoFarFetched> I mean it happens geefShrug you sometimes get a lot more killers than others.
[0:22:46] <+3d_pbandj> I tried to play spirit and couldn't catch anyone...woof
[0:22:50] <+QueequegTheater> Almost finished with that fence
[0:22:58] <+Mendin> Paige I think they meant the killer Plague not the farmer Plague
[0:23:07] <+Mendin> vommy mommy
[0:23:09] <Faustgesicht> Meant the vomiting plague fro m dbd but good to know
[0:23:14] <$thomassolorio> ha
[0:23:23] <KingKZ> I refuse to believe Nurse is actually playable. It has to be a massive prank.
[0:23:24] <%superc37> plagues also kin of meh on the tierlist
[0:23:26] <TakingLifesL> farmer plague isn't a killer?
[0:23:28] <phantomsleeves> @3d_pbandj spirit is definitely easier at higher ranks where people don‚Äôt hide the entire time
[0:23:39] <%ospreyworks> loving the progress on the stream room, Peach! I feel like you need a neon peach sign behind you
[0:23:40] <@SoFarFetched> @KingKZ I mean Nurse is literally practice remembering muscle memory on her blink.
[0:23:44] <$thomassolorio> why dont u like dead people dimonds
[0:23:46] <+Mendin> Plaguette is a solid mid-tier
[0:23:48] <+QueequegTheater> yet
[0:23:56] <+Mendin> @TakingLifesL Does he own pigs?
[0:24:04] <Badgerconda_> What happened to the sex dungeon stream room?
[0:24:06] <@SoFarFetched> along with what you can/can't blink through
[0:24:18] <+3d_pbandj> @phantomsleeves That was exactly it. I couldn't find a single person
[0:24:19] <@PlagueOfGripes> we used to own pigs
[0:24:19] <pretendofriendo> he owns sheep
[0:24:19] <+QueequegTheater> I still don't understand why they nerfed Pig's traps
[0:24:19] <Theo_Marks> The room looks sick!!!
[0:24:26] <%superc37> nemisis still desperately needs a buff to escape c tier
[0:24:26] <%ComfortableStranger> Ashley roboto has a neon sign that says "fuck" behind her
[0:24:31] <$thomassolorio> @TakingLifesL be wary of anyy man that keeps a pig farm

[0:41:51] <+Ches_Neckbeard> Rumsfeld was not shot
[0:41:52] <MrChaosDoughnut> You made the right choice.
[0:41:52] <Arancet> cheney did shooting
[0:41:54] <@commanderclaw> No, he was secretary of defense at the time
[0:41:55] <@SoFarFetched> @Ascethetic for Decisive Strike? geefThink hmm...kinda wanna say monitor & abuse gets the slightly better edge
[0:41:55] <%baronblank> cheney shot the guy, the guy who got shot apologized

[0:41:56] <PinoProxie> paige pat just told you

[0:41:59] <%ElkRiverDog> To be fair‚Ä¶beast wars.
[0:41:59] <+patriotrenegade> Rumsfeld helped orchestrate the invasion of Iraq in 2003 under false pretenses and is responsible for the current disastrous situation in the Middle East, so he's basically responsible for like 4 million dead people
[0:41:59] <teefpal> Dick Cheney shot a guy in the face
[0:42:01] <Maids4lyfe> HE'S JUST A WAR CRIMINAL
[0:42:03] <@SoFarFetched> Unless you mean deathslinger

[0:46:08] <@MelBrooksKA> DON'T LET YOUR DREAMS BE DREAMS
[0:46:12] <+Mendin> Paige FFXIV is an RPG that happens to also be an MMO, it is not an MMO that is an RPG
[0:46:12] <@PlagueOfGripes> it took me 3 months to get to the end of shadowbringers
[0:46:13] <Sacksquatch> being bad is the first step of gettin' good
[0:46:15] <+RaziWraith> You'll be bad at it but it will be fine! There is always someone worse.
[0:46:20] <@SoFarFetched> @Ascethetic rip those cakes geefCry none of my killers are prestiged because my minds like "but all those items/bloodpoints I used""
[0:46:20] <%ospreyworks> dang it, I will never know what killer she would cosplay

[0:46:26] <Dakuu75> I can't remember where I stopped playing XIV but, I didn't get to that big-castle zone in the icea area yet
[0:46:41] <$GarbageNirvana> @Ches_Neckbeard In fact that free trial includes the expansion Heavensward, which you may have heard is award-winning
[0:46:46] <+Mendin> @Dakuu75 You should pick back up, ice castle town is the start of great content

[0:46:52] <freelancebabymaker> or plague
[0:46:56] <gundam_fighter_kenshiro> pyramid head
[0:46:57] <MittensBroadcast> triangle girl
[0:46:59] <%ennui_on_me> Final Fantasy XI has been incredible for me so far, and if XIV is even better then I can't wait
[0:46:59] <%Reaped_Psyche> The answer is yes, because I see beautiful face!
[0:47:00] <%Fooguwu> Fooguwu subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 4 months! Yesterday I saw the woman I hoped to marry for the last time.

[0:47:02] <@SoFarFetched> @PlagueOfGripes Is that from starting from the very beginning? I went t hrough ARR in a month.
[0:47:11] <%Treuan> Legion would be simple as well

[0:47:17] <+SharpClaw_> not buff enough
[0:47:22] <freelancebabymaker> paige as the pig
[0:47:23] <RickyRelucent> Cosplay as those old ass paintings, with pitchfork guy and his wife infront of a barn
[0:47:23] <hairtoday> go plague, get gold
[0:47:34] <leinadtonu> Eli?
[0:47:37] <nivlac_555> Eli?

[0:47:51] <%Treuan> give it time, you'll levitate eventually
[0:48:06] <Zeif00> Just stand on Pat, it'd be about the same distance above the ground
[0:48:07] <%ComfortableStranger> how do you know you can't levitate if you've never tried
[0:48:07] <+Mendin> You're like literally half of Plague(killer)'s height
[0:48:07] <+BubbaRands> Killer? Eli?
[0:48:08] <wolfen091> killer plague, farmer plague... not seeing a difference
[0:48:11] <@SoFarFetched> Is this the laptop with pretty much the melted keyboard
[0:48:15] <%SilvaChariot0133> @Ches_Neckbeard until level 60, no time limit at all Kappa
[0:48:18] <Piemono> Get a new laptop?
[0:48:20] <Artista_AF> you could totally pull off an Eli cosplay

[0:48:35] <Dakuu75> this is too-real to be made up
[0:48:40] <@SoFarFetched> geefBounce *
[0:48:43] <+Mendin> Please tell me you at least got a cooling fan pad for your laptop to keep it from meltdowning as fast
[0:48:53] <Ziegsy> The nurse costume would be super easy to make, Could even make it look like you were levitating
[0:48:54] <$shurtal> Please everyone how we live
[0:48:56] <+MoonObscure> LOL
[0:49:05] <AFlyingTaco1> Fuck, that was 3 years ago already

[1:11:11] <Zeif00> I just got Kate's bikini outfit, very nice
[1:11:11] <vonmaultke> I dunno, Plagues looks better to me Jebaited

[1:11:45] <@SoFarFetched> @CappuccinoGuil yeah when you grab a perk on the web it starts at level one,and when it appears on the web when you grab it,it levels up and the perk gets better.
[1:11:57] <@SoFarFetched> max is level 3 for perks.
[1:12:00] <RickyRelucent> I don't even play this game
[1:12:00] <@PatStaresAt> Are they searching for a match or what
[1:12:02] <RickyRelucent> : 3

[1:12:08] <@SoFarFetched> they JUST started searching I believe
[1:12:22] <@SoFarFetched> Plague did warn the queue would be awhile.
[1:12:23] <great_wide_shark> queues are cursed tonight. allegedly patched, but we'll see
[1:12:24] <+BlowFireThroatTotem> WHAT-A-MATCH
[1:12:25] <+patriotrenegade> I heard Pyramid Head's ass got nerfed
[1:12:27] <CappuccinoGuil> @SoFarFetched neato
[1:12:38] <critiquequartz> As a lesbian I feel like I can‚Äôt have too much flannel but going through my closet revealed that half my shirts are flannels
[1:12:39] <+Ascethetic> killer queues arent bad atm

[1:13:00] <%Ranryu692> some shade
[1:13:01] <RickyRelucent> Like tricks etc
[1:13:02] <+toolofparanoia> Front harness so the dog can't drag you
[1:13:09] <RickyRelucent> Like make the puppy practice his rotations
[1:13:11] <RickyRelucent> or strings
[1:13:12] <HotSauceFiend> Tips for Teaching dog how to "Speak"
[1:13:13] <Maids4lyfe> it's hard to put a collar on orb-shaped dogs
[1:13:28] <CappuccinoGuil> Harnasses are great for small dogs. Collars can be easier to train bigger dogs, but you have to be careful on your pulls
[1:13:36] <Littlecjmajor> we used to use harnesses on our bulldogs but they found ways to slip out of them on walkies and then would go exploring on their own
[1:14:14] <@SoFarFetched> man imagine a pat stream where Paige is on the side sign languaging what pat says.
[1:14:26] <@JustinianKnight> hand signs are cool cuz then you feel like a dog wizard
[1:14:30] <%ItalianWaifu> is that how you train Pat too
[1:14:35] <topendbuzza> did you train pat the same?
[1:14:36] <@PatStaresAt> paige u looks super good on camera and your room look nice
[1:14:38] <%bravebravesrobin> that's an insanely good idea
[1:14:51] <+Mindtrick_Matt> Oh hey we're in the game now lol
[1:14:53] <RickyRelucent> So anybody gonna play freddy, or the wallhack ghost
[1:14:55] <HotSauceFiend> isnt a handshake the same thing as a high five for dogs?
[1:15:05] <@MelBrooksKA> Oh no, Pat's being nice, what did we do....
[1:15:05] <Dementedpenguin> I ship it.
[1:15:11] <@MelBrooksKA> he*
[1:15:12] <@ckbooks> Ron staaahp.
[1:15:31] <@PatStaresAt> Wow your Q is fucking terrible
[1:15:42] <ergulor> your paw?
[1:15:47] <@Jekado> Which is easier training Gief or training pat?
[1:15:49] <topendbuzza> can't belive peach is sleeping with one of the mods Kappa
[1:15:51] <@PlagueOfGripes> survivor queues are very long
[1:16:01] <RickyRelucent> Think its more like, what did pat to.
[1:16:04] <+doomunderthestairs> I taught my pups turn around and lay down as well which came easy

[1:16:08] <RickyRelucent> To be more specific, what he is going to do
[1:16:15] <RickyRelucent> he's basically stacking good karma in his own way
[1:16:18] <%walternatorz> Pat did build your spice rack.
[1:16:22] <+Mindtrick_Matt> Pat took longer
[1:16:37] <jetpack_rorschasch> But they both smell and eat too much. Kappa
[1:16:38] <miniyuna> she hss trouble understanding 'wait' but got sit really well
[1:16:41] <+BlowFireThroatTotem> Are there times when you have to literally fight your dog?

[1:23:29] <dekkitout> Cyber Plague seems more human oddly SeriousSloth
[1:23:32] <@SoFarFetched> Then Plague just get's "spirited away" from the match
[1:23:33] <MarylandJutsu> is it the eli wifi? aka the crappy wifi
[1:23:40] <Dunmarkh> damn you american isps
[1:23:43] <Ziegsy> @hotsaucefiend some screens were shared today
[1:23:45] <%ItalianWaifu> tomatoGrease where are you going cutie
[1:23:55] <HotSauceFiend> @Ziegsy thanks, i must have missed that
[1:24:02] <nivlac_555> robo-plague
[1:24:03] <%king_wragles> Plague is talking like Mordin.
[1:24:05] <+tigerfang86> UpUH
[1:24:11] <%Chichen> i can understand 1/3 of what plague says
[1:24:14] <+BlowFireThroatTotem> Paige has an italian accent
[1:24:20] <AFlyingTaco1> Shut upUH you face
[1:24:37] <Dakuu75> @Ziegsy @HotSauceFiend well, I heard the current versions on steam actually play bad, w/e the pixel quality is.
[1:24:40] <Ziegsy> i appreciate the footstep noises. they are very good
[1:24:53] <$SiameseSneeze> there she goes again
[1:24:59] <+tigerfang86> that is how space works
[1:25:01] <%ItalianWaifu> do the engines change places or are they in the same spot every map
[1:25:01] <RickyRelucent> SPOOKY SOUNDS
[1:25:16] <+tigerfang86> @ItalianWaifu they change every round
[1:25:19] <HotSauceFiend> @Dakuu75 aren't the current steam versions going to be pulled soon?
[1:25:24] <@Jekado> Looks like Yu Jin is Yu Jout
[1:25:26] <@MelBrooksKA> So what's spirit's deal?
[1:25:33] <+BlowFireThroatTotem> What's the pint of going to the Killer's lair?
[1:25:37] <+BlowFireThroatTotem> *point
[1:25:43] <+tigerfang86> item chest

[1:25:48] <+BlowFireThroatTotem> Ah
[1:25:49] <Dementedpenguin> @MelBrooksKA can travel while invisible
[1:25:51] <AFlyingTaco1> @Dakuu75 Basically, the Steam versions of the games are just ports of the PS1 version, so the translations aren't as good as the GBA versions, and the menu has to load every time you hit the button to open it.
[1:25:58] <+InuOblivion> The killer can hook you down there too
[1:26:30] <Dakuu75> @AFlyingTaco1 oh, ew, extra load times~
[1:26:58] <+tigerfang86> gross mode
[1:27:02] <+BlowFireThroatTotem> The character kinda looks like Madonna
[1:27:08] <lemon_lover28> creepy mode activate

[1:34:01] <zeekayart> yeah you're cool I GUESS
[1:34:04] <T_Sasquatch> (silence)
[1:34:17] <TurtlesAndTentacles> Plauge's sound is horrible
[1:34:27] <@PatStaresAt> Paiges frustration at you trying to actually find out about what she wanted to tell you is always baffling
[1:34:29] <@SoFarFetched> reminds me when pat came into the room to talk to paige about something and suddenly "OMG THERE's CAKE" and Pat was like "Paige,look at me not the screen"
[1:34:29] <TakingLifesL> paige is great, her hair is so pretty and she is smart
[1:34:34] <T_Sasquatch> his wifi is still manually cranked

[1:34:53] <CalderGaming> hey paige who's rumsfeld again

[1:35:04] <CappuccinoGuil> Paige, you're emotionally smart?
[1:35:08] <MarylandJutsu> and youre just there
[1:35:14] <@CreepyPorpoise> Paige has big emotional intelligence
[1:35:16] <T_Sasquatch> Smrt !
[1:35:23] <@SoFarFetched> billions and biollions
[1:35:23] <zeekayart> @CreepyPorpoise wow lol

[1:35:27] <+EdHeng> literally billions
[1:35:28] <@CreepyPorpoise> :C
[1:35:29] <@SoFarFetched> yeah its back on
[1:35:34] <zeekayart> emotions are valid!!!!!!
[1:35:36] <@SoFarFetched> they turned it on a few hours ago
[1:35:39] <@CreepyPorpoise> have you seen how emotionally constipated people are
[1:35:46] <RickyRelucent> having emotions just isn't smart to begin with
[1:35:46] <@CreepyPorpoise> maybe u just like emotional kombucha
[1:35:50] <RickyRelucent> Horrible business policies
[1:35:54] <+BlowFireThroatTotem> Paige is intelligent at revenge
[1:35:58] <MarylandJutsu> maybe empathy wisdom
[1:36:11] <@CreepyPorpoise> you're also quick comedically
[1:36:12] <T_Sasquatch> I am an Empath aiyanyNotlikethiss aiyanyHomework
[1:36:14] <MarylandJutsu> tactful
[1:36:15] <MarylandJutsu> ?
[1:36:16] <+EdHeng> situational awareness is emotional intelligence
[1:36:18] <RickyRelucent> Manipulative is explotive tho
[1:36:26] <CalderGaming> only if you're a sociopath eli
[1:36:27] <MarylandJutsu> tactful is the word eli
[1:36:29] <T_Sasquatch> im so empathetic bro
[1:36:33] <@CreepyPorpoise> maybe I don't understand what the definition of emotional intelligence is
[1:36:34] <CappuccinoGuil> ALL CAKES
[1:36:36] <jetpack_rorschasch> The fact that you know not to trust those people means you're smarter than most people Paige.
[1:36:55] <Badgerconda_> she's trying to manipulate us into thinking she's not manipulative, don't fall for it guys
[1:36:55] <topendbuzza> like pat
[1:36:58] <+patriotrenegade> Your detractors on Twitter always call you manipulative
[1:37:02] <MarylandJutsu> the manipulative people they know: elmo
[1:37:12] <CappuccinoGuil> paige is a himbo
[1:37:16] <MarylandJutsu> paige doesn't have the brain cells to scheme
[1:37:21] <+Shacklebox> Paige manipulated you into thinking she's manipulative
[1:37:21] <@SoFarFetched> She's manipulating us into thinking she's smarter than we actually think she is geefSmugAF
[1:37:27] <T_Sasquatch> manipulative is a weird word because being convincing isnt an evil trait LUL
[1:37:32] <wolfen091> paige is so manipulative that it seems like she's not manipulative at all
[1:37:36] <voodoo_zombie_dx> Shes a master mind in self destruction
[1:37:40] <@SoFarFetched> yeah Ace is one of the quietest
[1:37:43] <MarylandJutsu> @SoFarFetched manipulating us to thinking she big and strong
[1:37:48] <@SoFarFetched> while some survivors like Jane are super loud geefAwk
[1:37:50] <%lKaleidoscopel> ace has a built in iron will
[1:37:53] <@MelBrooksKA> @SoFarFetched She's not doing a good job
[1:37:54] <HotSauceFiend> I think emotional intelligence is not being dense in specific social situations.
[1:38:00] <CappuccinoGuil> "You see, nobody can find out your plan if you don't even know what the plan is, it's perfect."
[1:38:01] <HotSauceFiend> YES GHOSTY
[1:38:01] <@SoFarFetched> LOOK AT HIS FAAACEEE
[1:38:07] <Broand> it's ghostface killa
[1:38:09] <+NWR_James> RIP Ghostface
[1:38:09] <jetpack_rorschasch> Sociopaths would say something like that. They think even attempting to help people technically means you're manipulating them. Fuck those assholes.
[1:38:13] <HotSauceFiend> My Favourite Killer
[1:38:15] <T_Sasquatch> ghost face killahhhh
[1:38:17] <@SoFarFetched> Just remember to look at his face so he doesn't get the expose on you.
[1:38:27] <HotSauceFiend> Ghostface needs more costumes
[1:38:30] <CappuccinoGuil> SHOW US THAT CAKE, GHOSTIE SwiftFace
[1:38:30] <T_Sasquatch> i still cant believe this game lasted 5 years
[1:38:37] <Broand> man repairing looks like it takes a minute
[1:38:48] <Dementedpenguin> So imagine Ghostface brought a cake with him.
[1:39:03] <CappuccinoGuil> @Dementedpenguin Ghostface IS the cake KappaPride
[1:39:06] <@Jekado> because they didn't get the license
[1:39:09] <+thotbane> they have the rights to the mask not the movie
[1:39:10] <Dementedpenguin> LUL
[1:39:12] <+doc_ock_rokc> @PeachSaliva Thats because the movie didn't own the rights to the mask
[1:39:14] <@SoFarFetched> cheaper to get the rights to the mask than the movie Kappa
[1:39:14] <T_Sasquatch> the general survivor gameplay doesnt seem to have changed in 5 years
[1:39:35] <+doc_ock_rokc> The studio was being dicks
[1:39:37] <MarylandJutsu> ya gotta cut those corners
[1:39:38] <@SoFarFetched> why didnt you run LUL
[1:39:38] <freelancebabymaker> its because of weird copyright shit
[1:39:40] <+goose_attack_almanac> Was the Ghstface Killer a different person in each movie
[1:39:42] <%lKaleidoscopel> LUL
[1:39:46] <@SoFarFetched> YOU HEARD THE EXPOSED EFFECT
[1:39:49] <MarylandJutsu> yes goose
[1:39:51] <@SoFarFetched> THAT MEANS HE SAW YOU geefDense
[1:40:03] <HotSauceFiend> Survivor gameplay hasn't changed must, just more perks that are.... not as useful
[1:40:03] <+doc_ock_rokc> He 99ed and then tapped and stuck
[1:40:06] <freelancebabymaker> because the mask wasnt made for the movie it was like licensed i guess?
[1:40:07] <+goose_attack_almanac> @MarylandJutsu So in a way it being related to the mask makes sense
[1:40:24] <MarylandJutsu> eh kinda?
[1:40:28] <@SoFarFetched> HES GOT IRON MAIDEN
[1:40:30] <MarylandJutsu> they all had their own petty reasons
[1:40:33] <HotSauceFiend> Man i just want Ghostface's Mask from Scary Movie, WASSAP

[1:43:17] <ohno778> Plague no bully...
[1:43:18] <HotSauceFiend> @GarbageNirvana Depends on how good the players in the rest of the team are. It's not fake,
[1:43:21] <@Jekado> @GarbageNirvana camping is even more stupid for a killer to do because they can do 3 gens at once
[1:43:22] <%superc37> @garbagenirvana wont stop ppl from doing it. plus in certain situations, its the only option to win

[1:47:12] <phantomsleeves> not a 4 with NOED :(
[1:47:13] <HotSauceFiend> Emotional intelligence led paige to abandon her survivor friends
[1:47:19] <HotSauceFiend> So smart
[1:47:22] <%ItalianWaifu> I'd abandon anyone in a heatbeat to live
[1:47:22] <wolfen091> paige is the chick who survives only to be haunted 4 movies later

[1:52:22] <+Sendrak70> Why would you regret it? What does it do to the character?
[1:52:23] <+soycanadiense> KITTY DRUM
[1:52:23] <@PatStaresAt> I prestiged 3 times Nemmy and PH because I love them
[1:52:36] <Mieuxe> moon2E
[1:52:37] <@SoFarFetched> just cosmetics
[1:52:40] <@SoFarFetched> Its mainly cosmetic
[1:52:43] <CappuccinoGuil> chat, holy FUCK, I killed a mosquito in my room, I can finally go to bed T^T
[1:52:43] <+Brickshurt> Me too pat, I like to prestige the ones I know I will keep playing
[1:52:59] <Ziegsy> pat you poop in the hall yet, coward?
[1:53:06] <@MelBrooksKA> @SoFarFetched I remember the stupidest things about the old podcast
[1:53:12] <+Sendrak70> Sounds like its nothing but positive.
[1:53:18] <@SoFarFetched> I still think they need to do a carryover of perks when you prestige.
[1:53:21] <Mieuxe> awww big purr
[1:53:22] <%ospreyworks> weird, I'm only getting 360p on mobile
[1:53:23] <%Chichen> @PatStaresAt I havent played in a while but PH was so fun
[1:53:29] <+BlowFireThroatTotem> KISS THAT LITTLE MAN
[1:53:32] <radda343> pat the toot
[1:53:43] <Samurai_Tchan> @MelBrooksKA lol
[1:53:43] <+soycanadiense> Paige looking like Dorothy from the Wizard of Oz
[1:53:46] <jetpack_rorschasch> He big a fluffy!
[1:53:47] <@SoFarFetched> but sometimes even with prestige you can still get abit screwed on the RNG
[1:53:50] <+doc_ock_rokc> SAINT ELMO
[1:53:51] <%ospreyworks> he is a fine little old grandpa
[1:54:11] <SuperVaderMan> Multiplayer mods exist for ocarina
[1:54:27] <@MelBrooksKA> I was never a big fan of prestiging since I saw it introduced in COD
[1:54:35] <Decarcassor> The bloodweb rarity increase from prestige is very, very minimal. And rarer add-ons and offering does not always mean better. Some ultra rares are bad, some commons are good.
[1:54:40] <@PatStaresAt> I want to stream a shitzillion things but I only have so much timez
[1:54:43] <Samurai_Tchan> @MelBrooksKA somebody should edit steve buscemi eyes over patrick's
[1:54:43] <jetpack_rorschasch> Now feed him that delicious delicious hair.
[1:55:03] <CappuccinoGuil> Alright, all, I'm heading to bed, enjoy the rest of the stream, Paige, don't die as much.
[1:55:03] <@SoFarFetched> "haha just kidding....unless?"
[1:55:08] <@MelBrooksKA> @Samurai_Tchan Do it coward
[1:55:21] <HotSauceFiend> Mani finished watching Voyager and I just cant get into Enterprise. It feels like step backwards
[1:55:27] <+Shacklebox> I've started watching DS9! love me some ferengi shenanigans
[1:55:32] <wolfen091> never, ds9 must be streamed

[1:56:13] <+doc_ock_rokc> DS9
[1:56:14] <Dunmarkh> hell yeah ds9
[1:56:17] <+doc_ock_rokc> is the best
[1:56:26] <+SharpClaw_> enterprise is quite an interesting time capsule
[1:56:36] <+Brickshurt> Are the cakes stacking for this event guys?
[1:56:36] <X2Eliah> kek
[1:56:40] <Samurai_Tchan> @MelBrooksKA ‚úç(‚óî‚ó°‚óî) will do
[1:56:41] <%CopperTucker> tbh I'd prefer to just watch DBD for a little while.
[1:56:45] <wolfen091> 11pm for the good time zone, mid night for them cake eaters out east
[1:56:49] <+doc_ock_rokc> I love star trek but DS9 pokes holes in the star trek universe and then fills them in with awesome ideas
[1:57:03] <+doc_ock_rokc> Unlike some recent shit shows
[1:57:31] <HotSauceFiend> CAt Hair is the handicap holding you back
[1:57:31] <X2Eliah> Paige stop eating Elmohair
[1:57:49] <DillWillCat> Elmo hair in thair
[1:58:32] <@MelBrooksKA> BACK TO BACK! Death comes arriving on a midnight train!
[1:58:55] <Zeif00> that sound goes off when you're near one of those anniversary pedestals
[1:59:27] <@SoFarFetched> YEAH LOOK AT THAT
[1:59:29] <@Jekado> WOW
[1:59:33] <Dunmarkh> get nae naed
[1:59:33] <@SoFarFetched> CHEFS KISS RIGHT THERE
[1:59:40] <@Jekado> DAT NETCODE
[1:59:41] <Zeif00> LUL
[1:59:49] <+thotbane> HE'S GOT THIGH HIGH BOOTS
[1:59:49] <BigFingerRo> peaches getting that good ol GAMER toxicity in
[1:59:57] <Samurai_Tchan> thats some diferent kind of ninja turtle
[2:00:14] <HotSauceFiend> With items you can hold 2 traps right?
[2:00:24] <HotSauceFiend> srry perk*
[2:00:24] <%SveriSageAdvice> for a game that relies on jukes and outsmarting the killer, it sure has some A+ netcode
[2:00:26] <@SoFarFetched> yeah there's addons that let you hold more traps
[2:01:04] <HotSauceFiend> Trapper becomes less powerful the higher your rank is. At least thats what i remember. At rank 1, its laughble to play as trapper
[2:01:38] <%ItalianWaifu> psaBig DICK
[2:01:49] <BigFingerRo> I LOVE how Pat shits up his own stream and Peaches in the same amounts
[2:02:17] <$GarbageNirvana> I love how hooks have a grunt birthday party now
[2:02:22] <HotSauceFiend> No don't be those red rank people, they crouch taunt all the time
[2:02:24] <Dementedpenguin> You don't want red rank. It's horrible there.
[2:02:38] <+Brickshurt> It's a miserable experience
[2:02:44] <+Demerson13> Most red ranks play worse than green ranks. It's utter nonsense.
[2:02:58] <Samaugsch2> Should i stay rank 20?
[2:03:15] <phantomsleeves> red ranks and yellow ranks are the worst players
[2:03:25] <+Brickshurt> Rank 20 is almost too goofy there's a happy middle ground around rank 8 I'd say
[2:03:35] <phantomsleeves> brown ranks are just new, can‚Äôt blame em
[2:03:44] <$GarbageNirvana> That's the killer's job tho
[2:03:47] <HotSauceFiend> I have not heard a single trap go off yet
[2:03:49] <Samaugsch2> Yeah, i‚Äôm never getting to rank 8 lol
[2:04:10] <$GarbageNirvana> idk I might be biased because of how many killer streams I've seen where survivors are just shits
[2:04:28] <+Brickshurt> It's easier than you'd think! The game sort of rewards you for long time play
[2:04:29] <$GarbageNirvana> And the game is very clearly survivor-biased
[2:04:36] <HotSauceFiend> Oh hes got that ruin perk on, thats nasty
[2:04:45] <X2Eliah> the gen repair takes so long
[2:05:06] <HotSauceFiend> @GarbageNirvana wit the right killers,you could dominate nearly every game
[2:05:10] <+MackFighters> @X2Eliah it's a minute and a half to do on your own
[2:05:21] <+InuOblivion> The hex that the killer has doesn‚Äôt help either
[2:05:29] <$GarbageNirvana> Eh, not on Haddonfield you can't
[2:05:31] <@SoFarFetched> Yeah depending on the killer,they can just not care if everyone gives cake geefShrug
[2:05:40] <californaya> Waste of a cake = when you see a girl with a fat ass and no boobs
[2:06:04] <X2Eliah> wow
[2:06:09] <X2Eliah> brave
[2:06:16] <$GarbageNirvana> That was a good play tho
[2:06:18] <BigFingerRo> @californaya fym that's the OPTIMAL build!
[2:06:25] <phantomsleeves> is someone gonna unhook that poor guy
[2:06:41] <californaya> I'm a breast man, sorry
[2:06:52] <+Brickshurt> What is her other two perks chat?
[2:06:57] <BigFingerRo> both big parts is too extravagant, you wanna have all skinny, big boobs or big ass
[2:07:18] <$GarbageNirvana> Counterpoint: nah
[2:07:19] <+MackFighters> Leg Man > Boob or Butt Man
[2:07:22] <phantomsleeves> @bigfingerro bond and windows of opportunity
[2:07:41] <BigFingerRo> if you have it all you risk running into an insane person or just having too much to handle
[2:07:42] <phantomsleeves> @brickshurt sorry, meant to mention you instead
[2:07:44] <kenny_biff> isn't this just that Jason game??
[2:07:46] <+Brickshurt> haha thanks
[2:07:46] <@MelBrooksKA> @MackFighters All degenerates
[2:07:49] <HotSauceFiend> Damn i miss playing as PH, those were all fun matches
[2:07:51] <Zeif00> ngl y'all kind of played this bad *shrug*
[2:08:10] <Faustgesicht> Holy shit that david choe show looks pretentious
[2:08:16] <%heartlesshealer> okay, legs, boobs, butt, whatever. But ARMS. Arms strong enough to destroy you
[2:08:20] <$GarbageNirvana> uh
[2:08:21] <%SveriSageAdvice> @kenny_biff the jason game came out like 1 year and a few months after this
[2:08:23] <HotSauceFiend> lol wtf
[2:08:23] <+Brickshurt> 2 dead at 4 gens seems like the typical red renk experience so I think you're already mostly there
[2:08:25] <Dakuu75> lol
[2:08:26] <Dunmarkh> LUL
[2:08:33] <+DigiDom> LUL LUL LUL
[2:08:34] <$GarbageNirvana> That miiight have been a little toxic
[2:08:35] <AFlyingTaco1> LUL
[2:08:36] <$GarbageNirvana> Just a bit
[2:08:37] <@Jekado> its why hiding in corners is bad
[2:08:40] <HotSauceFiend> at least he left you alone
[2:08:45] <kenny_biff> @SveriSageAdvice I see!
[2:09:05] <Dementedpenguin> Oh god he wants the 4k NotLikeThis ......
[2:09:08] <DillWillCat> Trapper more like clapper
[2:09:20] <$GarbageNirvana> I will say, in all the killer streams I watch I don't think I've ever seen one trapper
[2:09:32] <+Taisuru> Paige knows what the killer needs due to her emotional intelligence, and what he needs is to GET FUCKED
[2:09:32] <Dakuu75> i wonder if you could've phased through him during the trap-setting animation
[2:09:33] <+MackFighters> that trapper is rank 2? Wow.
[2:09:38] <HotSauceFiend> Red ranks are full of tryhrds
[2:09:43] <+Brickshurt> Otzdarva is the only trapper I can think of if you've seen him around
[2:09:46] <X2Eliah> like Pat?
[2:09:50] <BigFingerRo> man, I HATE the term tryhard
[2:09:50] <%heartlesshealer> worse than pat
[2:09:53] <%ItalianWaifu> why wait to recover?
[2:10:00] <@Jekado> Otz is a trapper main no?
[2:10:03] <Dementedpenguin> And this is why red ranks is miserable
[2:10:06] <BigFingerRo> what's so wrong about trying your best at things?
[2:10:12] <$GarbageNirvana> Is he not supposed to try hard to win the game?
[2:10:16] <+MackFighters> Otz plays all killers, he doesn't really main anyone
[2:10:18] <$GarbageNirvana> He is a killer, should he not kill
[2:10:24] <BigFingerRo> I feel like that's a hipster thing, not liking effort
[2:10:27] <%heartlesshealer> there's trying your best, and trying your best while being an ass about it
[2:10:32] <X2Eliah> try, but dont be a penis
[2:10:33] <Zeif00> not everybody has the same goals in this game
[2:10:34] <nivlac_555> lol
[2:10:36] <RickyRelucent> Its funner if you're an actual tryhard
[2:10:37] <%ItalianWaifu> you can try hard and then you can "Try Hard"
[2:10:38] <%SveriSageAdvice> the main thing is to be the best Horror slasher as you can be
[2:10:42] <RickyRelucent> and not a meta or top tier only shitlord
[2:10:44] <+Brickshurt> At 4 gens left there's a bit of sportsmanship to show mercy for fun
[2:10:45] <+SharpClaw_> try to have fun
[2:10:46] <CalderGaming> this game is jank like that
[2:10:47] <+Taisuru> CAW CAW
[2:11:00] <+Taisuru> psaCaw
[2:11:01] <Zeif00> was he supposed to let you go?
[2:11:01] <$GarbageNirvana> I mean he shoulda just swung sure
[2:11:05] <%SveriSageAdvice> killing survivors isnt the actual main goal, but more to be the best shithead and ruin their day
[2:11:05] <@SoFarFetched> Think he's trying to find the meg to see if she's waiting for hatch
[2:11:07] <DillWillCat> I‚Äôm more of a ‚ÄúFryhard‚Äù myself
[2:11:11] <+Hyroph> is plagues voice kinda distorted? dont mean to complain, just wanna check if my pc audio acting up
[2:11:16] <TurtlesAndTentacles> I dont get it
[2:11:23] <RickyRelucent> Im more of a dryfart
[2:11:25] <@SoFarFetched> @Hyroph its not just you
[2:11:25] <HotSauceFiend> Playing a good game is one where everyone enjoys the experience. And you get good games like with ghostface. Some killers can be real disckish and those are tryhards
[2:11:26] <BigFingerRo> @Zeif00 I suspect he should've just attacked and be done with it
[2:11:28] <$GarbageNirvana> @Hyroph Plauge lives in rural America
[2:11:30] <X2Eliah> yeah plague is kinda compressed
[2:11:30] <@Jekado> Otz did a thing where he max out points while dying
[2:11:31] <@MelBrooksKA> @Hyroph Bad internet
[2:11:33] <Broand> It's plaguetron, he's only into robofurries
[2:11:35] <+A_DEAD_SHOW> is plague talking about otz?
[2:11:35] <phantomsleeves> you have to leave that corner to get the crow to leave paige
[2:11:35] <%ItalianWaifu> @Hyroph is is
[2:11:37] <@Jekado> it was neat
[2:11:38] <%SveriSageAdvice> you get way more points for messing with them than outright tunneling/going after specific people over and over
[2:11:46] <@SoFarFetched> No I think he was trying to find the meg so she doesn't get hatch.
[2:11:46] <HotSauceFiend> THeres no benefit to being rank one, except for bragging rights
[2:11:47] <Dementedpenguin> I had a teammate kill themselves on the hook when I tried unhooking them. That's the kind of survivors I get LUL
[2:11:49] <@SoFarFetched> Cause you're on death hook.
[2:11:56] <@SoFarFetched> cause theres the chance once you're dead,she escapes with hatch.
[2:12:04] <+Brickshurt> He do be hurting for the 4k
[2:12:09] <$GarbageNirvana> see this is why I don't play games like this, too much toxicity in the meta
[2:12:09] <Dementedpenguin> Out of spite for not unhooking them before finishing a gen
[2:12:10] <+MackFighters> 4 gens remaining LUL
[2:12:13] <@SoFarFetched> Killers will leave you to make sure they don't get hatch.
[2:12:22] <+Cairo_Cat> its been way to long since i caught a paige stream
[2:12:25] <HotSauceFiend> Shouldnt the hatch be on the map now
[2:12:26] <phantomsleeves> look for hatch at this point, that girl will probably kill herself
[2:12:34] <TurtlesAndTentacles> I guess? I mean I use to fuck with people Play Jason on that Shitty Friday the 13th game
[2:12:37] <+MackFighters> hatch hasn't spawned yet
[2:12:51] <$GarbageNirvana> Well at least he gave you that
[2:12:53] <Dakuu75> who the fuck is that killer?
[2:12:57] <@SoFarFetched> The Trapper
[2:13:07] <+MackFighters> Totally not Jason
[2:13:08] <+Taisuru> The Crapper
[2:13:09] <%lKaleidoscopel> no only at 1 gen or last survivor
[2:13:10] <Dakuu75> oh-wow... his skin is really good
[2:13:15] <buuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuut> Peach do you like the 90‚Äôs boy band b4-4???
[2:13:23] <HotSauceFiend> @GarbageNirvana It's a fun game, just when you get to the high ranks, it gets less fun i found
[2:13:25] <DillWillCat> Trapped in his own toxic game
[2:13:29] <Faustgesicht> I keep downloading and uninstalling on whether I feel like dealing with the toxicity
[2:13:40] <jemeralddragoon> Paige this is a competitive game, not a farming simulator
[2:13:45] <+Taisuru> Paige have you ever run into pat at random while he was playing killer?
[2:13:59] <Dakuu75> lol
[2:14:03] <ChaosedStar> Farm Deez Nutz
[2:14:04] <+MackFighters> 'competitive game' LMAO
[2:14:07] <%SveriSageAdvice> damn rude lol, its just a vidya gaem
[2:14:08] <HotSauceFiend> Farm for Bloodpoints!
[2:14:14] <Dakuu75> LOL
[2:14:22] <%SveriSageAdvice> Paige is havin fun, that's all that matters lol
[2:14:22] <Dementedpenguin> This game is NOT competitive LUL Even if that person is joking
[2:14:24] <vonmaultke> This game makes you play for points, not lifes
[2:14:32] <Dakuu75> @SveriSageAdvice ^
[2:14:34] <phantomsleeves> would you know it was pat by his play style?
[2:14:46] <X2Eliah> Dead by Daylight is T3h PR0 E-Sp0rtz
[2:14:47] <@SoFarFetched> most important thing is :are you having fun?
[2:15:09] <AFlyingTaco1> WHY YA SO TOXIC!?
[2:15:15] <X2Eliah> Pat is not toxic, he is venemous
[2:15:18] <%SveriSageAdvice> "a little bit"
[2:15:21] <wolfen091> his balls be toxic
[2:15:26] <+MackFighters> tell Pat to stop Face Camping me
[2:15:41] <HotSauceFiend> When you get to high rank killer, it's very enticing to be pure toxic waste
[2:15:42] <vonmaultke> LUL love it
[2:15:51] <X2Eliah> @wolfen091 just the one
[2:15:52] <TurtlesAndTentacles> Paige, Pat would kick your ass
[2:15:58] <+doc_ock_rokc> I'll do that if they are pricks to me in match
[2:16:17] <+SharpClaw_> pat will gank a lv 1 guy and laugh in his face
[2:16:18] <+MackFighters> oh hi Pat
[2:16:26] <+Taisuru> Hi he's pat
[2:16:27] <HotSauceFiend> Also to anyone watching this game for the first time, watch a Pat stream where is playing killer. Its a completely differnet game
[2:16:37] <@SoFarFetched> LUL
[2:16:37] <Dakuu75> oh-hi pat
[2:16:45] <AFlyingTaco1> Wow what a bastard LUL

[2:17:22] <+SharpClaw_> Pat is the reason for player decline XD
[2:17:23] <+doc_ock_rokc> I was unintentionally toxic once. I took a guy near the hatch but couldn't figure out how to put him down then I waited for him to wiggle out and he didn't so I hooked him and shut the gate and he reported me
[2:17:23] <+Taisuru> Get outuhhhhh
[2:17:25] <Dakuu75> get out-UH
[2:17:26] <%heartlesshealer> Wash your marriage orb!

[2:18:34] <DillWillCat> Pat was so toxic it affects anyone he tells it about to be even more toxic
[2:18:37] <HotSauceFiend> forgetting the camera is there is not a good idea
[2:18:44] <+Bailey__gaming> I love pat's giggles
[2:18:50] <%Chichen> is he fortnite dancing
[2:18:50] <+Taisuru> <3
[2:18:51] <jetpack_rorschasch> Pat loves bullying.

[2:19:07] <X2Eliah> He is literally like a gremlin in your house
[2:19:09] <+toolofparanoia> Bullied in real life = bully in video games
[2:19:10] <Zeif00> Those are the words of a man who's been raw dogged HARD by some surivivors
[2:19:21] <+Mendin> @PeachSaliva I just tweeted pat the forum bit so he can cackle more
[2:19:28] <StarlitStunner> Aspire to be like DSP
[2:19:35] <+Bailey__gaming> Eli Internet cutting out
[2:19:47] <@SoFarFetched> no Pat wants his dick to feel huge reading the post
[2:20:01] <DillWillCat> Pat needs an intervention
[2:20:04] <+toolofparanoia> sometimes you just gotta do a little trolling
[2:20:10] <X2Eliah> msn? EWW
[2:20:17] <+doc_ock_rokc> WHAT EWWW
[2:20:17] <phantomsleeves> as long as pat doesn‚Äôt face camp NotLikeThis
[2:20:23] <+MackFighters> Not using a cake offering. Absolute tragedy.
[2:20:24] <+doc_ock_rokc> fuck
[2:20:38] <+doc_ock_rokc> I try not to face camp
[2:20:42] <AFlyingTaco1> So what's the deal with the cakes? And no this isn't a Seinfeld reference.
[2:20:48] <+doc_ock_rokc> but sometimes i run into rescurers
[2:20:54] <@SoFarFetched> cakes reward more bloodpoints to everyone.
[2:20:55] <%SveriSageAdvice> oh my god that forum post reads "nah man i totally wasnt mad"
[2:20:56] <X2Eliah> what is face camping?
[2:21:08] <DillWillCat> Face camping is too basic for Pat
[2:21:13] <@SoFarFetched> @X2Eliah when you hook someone and just STAY there watching them on hook
[2:21:14] <Dementedpenguin> @X2Eliah hook someone and then just stand in front of them until they die
[2:21:18] <ferbeholds> everyone gets a lot of cakes too
[2:21:21] <AFlyingTaco1> Okay so they're like experience boosters
[2:21:21] <X2Eliah> oh
[2:21:22] <+Bailey__gaming> Hai Paige how are you anyway? I can't believe that I'm 40 now lol, I feel so old,
[2:21:28] <+MackFighters> More cake's offered, more points. 5 Cakes = 5.25x multiplier
[2:21:29] <X2Eliah> oknyeah that sucks
[2:21:31] <+Demerson13> Additively, not multiplicatively though.
[2:21:34] <+doc_ock_rokc> You can COMPLETELY level up killers easily
[2:21:40] <AFlyingTaco1> That's kind of cool
[2:21:41] <Dementedpenguin> DbD events bring out the worst in people
[2:21:43] <+InuOblivion> Dem cakes
[2:21:51] <@PatStaresAt> haha they mad

[2:23:10] <+Mendin> Not Reddit, so y'all cant peanut gallery it
[2:23:15] <Paperware> Deja*
[2:23:15] <Dementedpenguin> Nea the Killer strikes again.
[2:23:16] <HotSauceFiend> huh she left you alone
[2:23:17] <+Mendin> (It was on SA)
[2:23:17] <BigFingerRo> Hey Plague, how's Starlink working out for you? It recently started out here in Mexico and I'm considering it
[2:23:32] <+InuOblivion> Why would they make the hit box so big
[2:23:39] <jemeralddragoon> I hate these farming events. I will purposefully go around as survivor and get the other 3 people caught and make sure they can‚Äôt be saved and then I will let the killer hook me so everyone dies on first hook, especially when more than 1 cake is used
[2:23:42] <+doc_ock_rokc> @BigFingerRo he can't see you
[2:23:49] <@PatStaresAt> hey @PeachSaliva when are u going to try monster hunter with me ;_;
[2:23:59] <BigFingerRo> aw boo
[2:24:01] <+doc_ock_rokc> @PeachSaliva HEY PEACH ask plague about his skylink
[2:24:20] <yeildingthought> It‚Äôs offaly nice of paige to be next to a hook each time for the killer Kappa
[2:24:24] <@Jekado> can't wait for Rise on PC
[2:24:26] <Zeif00> @jemeralddragoon jesus
[2:24:39] <@PatStaresAt> Yeah Jekado I totally dropped off switch rise specifically cause I knew I'd be diving in hard on PC
[2:24:41] <+Ches_Neckbeard> @PeachSaliva why aren't you spending quality time with Pat in the best selling game Monster Hunter?
[2:24:42] <@MelBrooksKA> not the ball titties
[2:24:47] <+Bailey__gaming> fuck my balls tittys indeed
[2:25:14] <@SoFarFetched> @jemeralddragoon geefAwk damn literally admitting to being toxic right up front. Just not play during anniversary?
[2:25:16] <%Chichen> same pat. Big regret. the FPS drives me mad after playing so much
[2:25:39] <@PatStaresAt> Its still really impressive for a switch game
[2:25:42] <@PatStaresAt> But after woirld on PC
[2:25:44] <+Ches_Neckbeard> we should keep tagging @PeachSaliva in chat so she keeps looking over and gets mer'd by the man
[2:25:46] <AFlyingTaco1> I'd play Rise a lot more if my fucking Switch's dock worked.
[2:25:49] <%ItalianWaifu> get fucked killer
[2:25:57] <+mikesapartment> why paige a big bully
[2:26:05] <jemeralddragoon> @sofarfetched no, the game should be played properly. I‚Äôm not here to farm
[2:26:07] <+Taisuru> LUL
[2:26:08] <indig0bird> Lmaoooo
[2:26:22] <%ItalianWaifu> is that the huntress i've heard so much about
[2:26:26] <jemeralddragoon> And I will ruin every farm match if need be
[2:26:31] <+BigbysOffice> wtf is fun
[2:26:39] <Mister_McDerp> LUL
[2:26:40] <Zeif00> @jemeralddragoon "properly"
[2:26:43] <%heartlesshealer> =)
[2:26:47] <@PatStaresAt> I can hear Eli sweating
[2:26:53] <TurtlesAndTentacles> plauge your shitty audio makes it hard to take your shit talk serious
[2:26:55] <@SoFarFetched> @jemeralddragoon so the game should be played "properly" by purposely sabotaging every match with cakes? geefThink
[2:27:04] <jemeralddragoon> As a survivor, yes I am here to win
[2:27:05] <+Bogart4321> is that why plague doesnt like fighting games?
[2:27:38] <+Bailey__gaming> I like your hoodie paige
[2:27:39] <@PatStaresAt> You're on discord delay you codger
[2:27:41] <%ItalianWaifu> there was like a 4 sec pause
[2:27:47] <%ItalianWaifu> thats on you Plauge
[2:27:47] <AFlyingTaco1> Sassy Plague is the best Plague
[2:27:59] <TurtlesAndTentacles> have better audio
[2:28:02] <jemeralddragoon> @sofarfetched no the game should be played like normal and you get whatever points you get based on how well you did, not because the killer decided to be nice
[2:28:15] <%ItalianWaifu> and thats on me for spellign Plague wrong
[2:28:19] <@PatStaresAt> @PeachSaliva paige when monster hunter rise come out on da PC do you wanna play with me
[2:28:24] <HotSauceFiend> @AFlyingTaco1 I didnt know ther was another flavour of Plauge other than sassy
[2:28:26] <phantomsleeves> it feels nice to be a nice killer sometimes, esp if someone runs you
[2:28:27] <@PatStaresAt> i will be ur friend
[2:28:32] <@SoFarFetched> well all I can say bruh is not play during event geefShrug Im pretty sure you can survive the 2 weeks not playing DbD without farmers.
[2:28:58] <jemeralddragoon> No, ruin the game for everyone involved
[2:29:00] <%DrFacilier> If you struggle they cant drop you? (new to dbd)
[2:29:13] <phantomsleeves> aw
[2:29:17] <@SoFarFetched> @DrFacilier they can still drop you while you are struggling. It's a button press.
[2:29:32] <%superc37> ill be honest i dont think she'll be able to ahndle monhun
[2:29:32] <%GabeSweetMan> The most polite murder.
[2:29:38] <X2Eliah> wagyu boeuf
[2:29:43] <@SoFarFetched> No they're literally butt hurt because "do as I say not as I do" as they sabotage games.
[2:29:48] <+BaronVonProlix> Sweat by Daylight in here
[2:29:56] <Zeif00> They sound fun at parties
[2:29:56] <jemeralddragoon> Fun is stupid
[2:30:02] <Mister_McDerp> no, people can only have fun in approved ways
[2:30:06] <Dementedpenguin> Okay now I just think you're trolling....
[2:30:07] <%superc37> given how its a game that requires some amount of planning, teamwork and the ability to think when under pressure
[2:30:10] <@SoFarFetched> so you play DbD to torture yourself and not have fun? geefThink
[2:30:11] <@Jekado> "I had fun once... it was awful"
[2:30:16] <+Ascethetic> I'm normally a nice killer unless a survivor t-bags me
[2:30:24] <VritraReiRei> Translation: "No!!! Play the game how I WANT IT TO BE PLAYED"
[2:30:27] <+Ascethetic> then its toxic city
[2:30:28] <@SoFarFetched> sounding like plague here Kappa
[2:30:33] <%ItalianWaifu> LUL
[2:30:35] <blue8moon> if it's an event put in place by the developers of the game, is it not intended play?
[2:30:37] <jemeralddragoon> No I play to win
[2:30:37] <+Bailey__gaming> lol
[2:30:46] <chowdah101> who hurt you
[2:30:48] <X2Eliah> Man this is some mentally fucked up scenario
[2:31:03] <pork_adobe> yikes lmfao
[2:31:07] <Mister_McDerp> super serious gamers only LUL
[2:31:08] <%ItalianWaifu> we're all friends here
[2:31:18] <+Brickshurt> You got a license for this here fun?
[2:31:22] <Invlux> awww LUL
[2:31:22] <phantomsleeves> i never see nice huntress, this is cool of her
[2:31:28] <DillWillCat> jdrag is beyond saving at this point
[2:31:28] <phantomsleeves> oh nvm
[2:31:35] <vonmaultke> damn~ LUL
[2:31:37] <HotSauceFiend> This is kinda rare to have this niceness last for so long though
[2:31:39] <TurtlesAndTentacles> I dont play to win. I Win to Play!
[2:31:49] <HotSauceFiend> but thats probably due to the farming event
[2:31:52] <BigFingerRo> I'm reminded of this guy that paid like 1k in aimbots and cheat stuff because, in his own words "I only have fun when I win"
[2:31:58] <@Jekado> I'm still confused what counts as winning some other streams say its only 12 hooks does the killer win else its a loss?
[2:32:00] <Invlux> LUL
[2:32:00] <+BaronVonProlix> hags?
[2:32:01] <@SoFarFetched> Imagine only having fun when you win.
[2:32:02] <susukouhai> cool huntress dont chase, they exclusively trickshots
[2:32:04] <+Ascethetic> bing bong bois are chill
[2:32:05] <Scorilla> yay im a wraith main :D
[2:32:12] <+MoxaHaunt> Does anyone play Piggy anymore?
[2:32:13] <ferbeholds> what about trappers
[2:32:14] <@SoFarFetched> Thats how people become drug addicts,because then the endorphines of winning wears off.
[2:32:18] <phantomsleeves> people are SO toxic to wraith and they‚Äôre still such nice killers :(
[2:32:33] <+Ascethetic> im nervous to play hag
[2:32:53] <lilachysteria> wraiths are either extremely wholesome or the saltiest dudes
[2:32:56] <+Bailey__gaming> is there a tos violation if you do this? I don't want you to get banned
[2:33:01] <lilachysteria> esp since they buffed him and a lot more people started playing him
[2:33:02] <%ItalianWaifu> is there a point where being nice becomes just toying with you?
[2:33:03] <+Demerson13> Paige usually when a killer swings at air while holding you means to stop wiggling
[2:33:04] <DillWillCat> As a wraith I‚Äôll just go in the corner and ring my bell if I meet low ranks
[2:33:12] <+Ascethetic> well shit, i think imma play some wraith for a bith
[2:33:15] <+BaronVonProlix> i always wanted to play deathslinger because his name is terrible and he has a funny gun that doesnt make sense
[2:33:16] <DillWillCat> Just to give them a break
[2:33:23] <HotSauceFiend> I dunno. some wraith killers are pure a-holes. One guy guarded his totem until all the gens were fixed then one-shotted us all
[2:33:39] <+Taisuru> Hit her with the pallet
[2:33:42] <+Ilpala> just think of how strong you'll be after this many zenkai boosts
[2:33:42] <@SoFarFetched> Sometimes killers end up having a change of heart halfway.
[2:34:04] <+doc_ock_rokc> Isn't that the point to play with survivors
[2:34:06] <@Jekado> @Bailey__gaming no i don't think any games has "You can only play one way" as a TOS just don't be toxic i think or using hacks?
[2:34:07] <AFlyingTaco1> This seems a lot nicer than something like Siege
[2:34:12] <lilachysteria> weirdly the nicest killers i've encountered were deathslingers and pyramid heads
[2:34:16] <+Taisuru> Tunneling and Gen Rushing shouldn't be complained about come at me
[2:34:17] <+doc_ock_rokc> Im a killer main and I always try to be fair unless you ahve a key
[2:34:22] <DillWillCat> A nice wraith inspired me to become one
[2:34:22] <+doc_ock_rokc> THEN YOUR FUCKED
[2:34:25] <HotSauceFiend> How is the Twins killer? I haven;t seen anyone play as...them yet
[2:34:28] <@SoFarFetched> Gen Rushing isn't even a thing anymore since Brand New Parts was nerfed.
[2:34:35] <Dementedpenguin> Sometimes I get killers that become generous if survivors DC. Or the opposite..... they go in HARD after the DCS WutFace
[2:34:49] <Scorilla> wraith main here and back when I played all the time I would basically try my best to play the role of "host" of every match, trying my best to make sure ppl have fun and get scared/are given fair chance but still trying to win
[2:35:05] <+Keiyum> I generally try to win every game I can because dudes will dunk on me otherwise but 100% the most fun games are playing pig and survivors start with the snoot boopin
[2:35:06] <@SoFarFetched> and doing gens is literally the thing the survivors are supposed to mainly do.
[2:35:10] <@SoFarFetched> so its weird when killers go "how dare you do gens"
[2:35:16] <Invlux> Huntress's humming is actually really soothing
[2:35:23] <BigFingerRo> are you playing for the killer's team? Ask her if she'll let you have an axe too lol
[2:35:25] <Zeif00> I think everybody should play both sides tbh
[2:35:29] <+Taisuru> @Dementedpenguin It depends basically, if it seems like a toxic SWF and the person DC'd just to fuck you hell yeah I'm gonna go hard
[2:35:35] <lilachysteria> kate & anna's adventure
[2:35:36] <+Bailey__gaming> @jekado I'd worry that this would class as exploit or something
[2:35:39] <+Taisuru> Otherwise I take it easy
[2:35:40] <lilachysteria> through ormond
[2:35:48] <AFlyingTaco1> Aw that was really wholesome
[2:35:49] <HotSauceFiend> Now lets rake in the points
[2:36:00] <%ComfortableStranger> @Invlux that's how she lulls you into a false sense of safety
[2:36:05] <+Demerson13> Console gamers aren't people
[2:36:08] <SuperVaderMan> console peasants don't deserve interaction
[2:36:28] <%ItalianWaifu> does that not suck for the dead players though?
[2:36:28] <+AdumPlaze> 95 raiders from AdumPlaze have joined!
[2:36:30] <@SoFarFetched> I like how I suddenly saw "dude stop healing"
[2:36:31] <+iLike_femboys> get raided boiiiii

[2:37:06] <HotSauceFiend> what is a raid?
[2:37:17] <+AdumPlaze> hope you're doing well
[2:37:22] <@SoFarFetched> @Bailey__gaming I mean its not an "exploit" cause they aren't changing anything about the game. If farming was bannable a lot of the DbD community would be gone geefShrug

[2:37:32] <KRSx360> swifUwU
[2:37:40] <Zeif00> Pat was bullied as a young killer
[2:37:47] <@SoFarFetched> yeah Blood points is capped at 32k plus whatever bonuses from items.

[2:39:06] <thoughtfullyqualitydonut> Adum raid, also it's only teabagging if it's more than twice, see the bathroom playing with yourself rule
[2:39:08] <AFlyingTaco1> It's interesting how the act of t-bagging/slow t-bagging is a universal language amongst video game players
[2:39:11] <RickyRelucent> and y'know, ppl do sleep on some things
[2:39:22] <@SoFarFetched> I always boop geefPoint
[2:39:27] <RickyRelucent> Thinking or trying different things works out, you don't have to repeat what the popular channels say
[2:39:32] <RickyRelucent> Lab some stuff yourself
[2:39:36] <+Bailey__gaming> @jekado fair just wanted to, bow
[2:39:36] <RickyRelucent> Hi : 3
[2:40:02] <Eppielicious> your hair looks so good
[2:40:05] <TurtlesAndTentacles> I cant shake it 50 times at the stall?
[2:40:06] <Invlux> I enjoy a hearty bounce every now and again
[2:40:07] <dashmatt> Bounce hardily
[2:40:15] <Noahccountingfortaste> there's a weird survivor morse code that I assert NO ONE fully understands
[2:40:16] <+Taisuru> Twerk
[2:40:16] <@Jekado> @Bailey__gaming nah i understand its how some games kinda morph into another type. i feel like some get bored doing the same thing and some just want to grind for the event.
[2:40:18] <RickyRelucent> crusty?
[2:40:22] <RickyRelucent> curtsey**
[2:40:30] <Scorilla> i cant not give someone the hatch if theyve had a garbage game or garbage teammates
[2:40:31] <DillWillCat> Paige confirmed to indeed bounce heartily
[2:40:45] <Xenioplate> I considered buying this on Switch but Pyramid Head and the RE stuff was extra DLC and I'd already brought like $75 worth of games in the eShop
[2:40:46] <Zeif00> everybody is on their own journey, watching Paige play got me into this game and I usually float around red ranks
[2:40:50] <@SoFarFetched> you can only communicate with survivor in so many ways,you either point,make the beckon motion or crouch
[2:40:54] <+BaronVonProlix> FORMAL JORTS
[2:40:56] <+doc_ock_rokc> No paige it can e concidered an insult in some languages to do that
[2:41:01] <X2Eliah> Having asl in thegame would be neat
[2:41:02] <Xenioplate> Does the Switch version have crossplay?
[2:41:03] <jetpack_rorschasch> "Hello there, allow me to show you a harty bounce in recognition of your kindness!" LUL
[2:41:19] <TurtlesAndTentacles> I dont play I only pretend to
[2:41:20] <Scorilla> also try to allow a "reset" if i immediately roll them cuz fast matches are no fun with these long queues
[2:41:26] <Invlux> afaik it's fingers pointed at mouth from front of chin, then present hand outward a little
[2:41:30] <+doc_ock_rokc> If the killer can couch it can be used as a cross killer languages
[2:41:35] <@SoFarFetched> I used to be Rank 2 for a good while,but then I got burnt out and in purple ranks.
[2:41:35] <X2Eliah> Like, havingASL in the game would get a lot of people to learn it
[2:41:36] <+BaronVonProlix> his jorts will protect you
[2:42:09] <RickyRelucent> Then again Paige, don't let all this uhuh it has to stay fun stuff hold you back
[2:42:10] <DillWillCat> Jorts of protecc
[2:42:22] <RickyRelucent> Don't be afraid to give yourself the tools you need, and just take it from there
[2:42:23] <Invlux> LUL
[2:42:26] <thoughtfullyqualitydonut> Sign language would be so helpful with situations that require you to be quiet. Like idk surviving a murderer
[2:42:30] <imaginaryfanboy> imagin46LUL

I recently binged original series Star Trek and while I was expecting a fair amount of camp, I was genuinely caught off guard by just how earnest, hopeful, and charming it was.

[3:01:57] <DillWillCat> Paige steals hope and leaves love
[3:02:10] <+MackFighters> Deathslinger

[3:02:41] <RickyRelucent> Rata-tat-tat
[3:02:47] <+doc_ock_rokc> YEah
[3:02:48] <%Chichen> WHALER ON THE MOON
[3:02:49] <@SoFarFetched> so he can tell you a WHALE of a tail
[3:02:49] <+doc_ock_rokc> I get that
[3:02:50] <blue8moon> a whaler on the moon?
[3:02:52] <lilachysteria> that would be sick
[3:02:54] <Invlux> Evil seaman LUL
[3:02:54] <X2Eliah> Like an Ahab character
[3:02:55] <lilachysteria> ASJF:SKF
[3:02:57] <Dementedpenguin> Like.... Ahab?
[3:03:00] <BigFingerRo> A fiddler!
[3:03:00] <+doc_ock_rokc> THAT WOULD BE SICK
[3:03:02] <cyclog> Holy shit Page, Your hair is looking fucking amazing. What did you do ? Coat it in car shining stuff or something ?
[3:03:06] <BigFingerRo> And you put him on the roof!"
[3:03:07] <HotSauceFiend> Whalers on the moon, we carry a harpoon
[3:03:13] <+doc_ock_rokc> @PeachSaliva who is your least favorite killer
[3:03:17] <slix3431> Anybody else just sing the Whalers on the moon song out loud?
[3:03:25] <Invlux> Evil Whaler could sing ominous shanties
[3:03:30] <lilachysteria> that would be so scary but i want it so bad
[3:03:34] <RickyRelucent> Oni is kinda broken, no?
[3:03:36] <%AncelDeLambert> he might be new
[3:03:44] <+doc_ock_rokc> @slix3431 no you are entirely alone
[3:03:47] <DillWillCat> Hunts the survivors to save the whales
[3:03:49] <Noahccountingfortaste> could be looking for the crown?
[3:03:57] <Oxybe> Evil Whaler chasing people with his cursed squeezebox
[3:03:57] <Zourath> Consider: Whaler killer, with whale survivor
[3:04:05] <Oxybe> singing terrible shanties
[3:04:12] <@Jekado> @doc_ock_rokc i think she said spirit?
[3:04:18] <slix3431> Killer whale killer
[3:04:22] <lilachysteria> grandpa's got a GUN
[3:04:23] <HotSauceFiend> I wlould love a killer robot
[3:04:26] <slix3431> Survivor whalers
[3:04:32] <+doc_ock_rokc> Spirit? why spirit is hard
[3:04:44] <DillWillCat> Call me Ishmael
[3:04:54] <Oxybe> would the killer robot be one of those 1950's dome head robots with the wacky flailing arms?
[3:04:59] <lilachysteria> @HotSauceFiend not exactly horror but the T1000 would be cool
[3:05:01] <@SoFarFetched> @doc_ock_rokc think from what I remember she doesn't like her invisible movement since she's bad against her. Same with Nurse.
[3:05:14] <+MackFighters> he might be running a blood warden build
[3:05:14] <+doc_ock_rokc> Nurse is evil
[3:05:14] <Noahccountingfortaste> incoming NOED?
[3:05:24] <X2Eliah> did the killer just peace out?
[3:05:24] <@SoFarFetched> time to bet if NOED is a thing.
[3:05:27] <lilachysteria> inb4 noed
[3:05:28] <HotSauceFiend> Yeah, its either gotta be a super Tacky robot or the T1000
[3:05:38] <+waltzqueen> killer MIA
[3:05:39] <@Jekado> Paige doesn't like it when she can't see the killers movement... so all killers... psaSmug
[3:05:58] <@SoFarFetched> take him to Pallet town geefSmugAF
[3:06:05] <jemeralddragoon> Its totally a farming bot
[3:06:06] <lilachysteria> deathslinger's just vibing
[3:06:09] <ferbeholds> maybe he just wants to go down in rank
[3:06:24] <TurtlesAndTentacles> my back hurts so much
[3:06:28] <jemeralddragoon> Just sitting in the same place, M1ing and sometimes using M2
[3:06:29] <$Pandora_Prime> Put a Dalek killer in, cowards
[3:06:31] <Noahccountingfortaste> yeah, looks like intentional depipping
[3:06:36] <DillWillCat> Killer confirmed scared of red ranking
[3:06:44] <Dementedpenguin> I mean he's running into a tree so......
[3:06:45] <%AncelDeLambert> just go
[3:06:45] <lilachysteria> he's probably a bot
[3:06:46] <+doc_ock_rokc> Dalek would be funny
[3:06:46] <%Chichen> ... botting?
[3:06:58] <%Chichen> botting to farm points or something?
[3:06:59] <Zourath> Honestly, I kind of want an Audrey II-esque killer, just to see how Behaviour would manage to impliment a mostly immobile killer.
[3:07:08] <HotSauceFiend> I've never seen a bot killer before, how pointless
[3:07:23] <Dementedpenguin> Now I'm confused.
[3:07:24] <lilachysteria> LMFAO
[3:07:25] <@SoFarFetched> geefThink see something new everyday
[3:07:33] <Invlux> Mysterious

[3:07:41] <%AncelDeLambert> good job, Paige
[3:07:42] <lilachysteria> i think it's a bot tied to the totem somehow
[3:07:46] <HotSauceFiend> Whata bizarre killer
[3:07:47] <%AncelDeLambert> yoinked by a bot
[3:07:50] <@SoFarFetched> "MY SKELETON"
[3:07:50] <AFlyingTaco1> A mazing
[3:07:55] <Noahccountingfortaste> oh, he wants the BP
[3:07:58] <HotSauceFiend> unless its the one-shot totem>
[3:08:01] <Noahccountingfortaste> thrill of the hunt gives extra BP, no?
[3:08:05] <DillWillCat> ‚ÄúHow embarrassing‚Ä¢
[3:08:05] <@Jekado> NO TOUCH ONLY SKELETON
[3:08:13] <+Hyroph> this isnt a bot, man just loves his totem
[3:08:15] <X2Eliah> He's such a bot
[3:08:41] <HotSauceFiend> you have a map!
[3:08:51] <@SoFarFetched> @Noahccountingfortaste just 10% for the hunting category but can be up to 50%
[3:08:59] <@SoFarFetched> This killer about to get an easy 4k at this rate LUL
[3:09:06] <Noahccountingfortaste> yeah, so he might just want to get his BP coupled with the cakes

[3:15:46] <%heartlesshealer> especially after finding out that psaGiefrail will chew cables
[3:16:06] <scottjefferson2punto0> im gonna miss that ginger goblin
[3:16:08] <Hick12> You put up a gate to keep Pat out.
[3:16:16] <Invlux> Basements are extremely pog
[3:16:21] <freelancebabymaker> that house is real weird sounding paige
[3:16:22] <@SoFarFetched> basements keep the people out
[3:16:26] <+RealThiele> the basement is in Eli's heart
[3:16:27] <Profmcstevie> I've only really heard concerns of flooding when being in a basement
[3:16:33] <DillWillCat> Links in the basement
[3:16:34] <+whyskeywolfe> Paige you needed air
[3:16:36] <TurtlesAndTentacles> fuck that shit. spiders are in the basement
[3:16:39] <blue8moon> flooding can be a problem
[3:16:40] <X2Eliah> I'd be very scared about flooding
[3:16:42] <+whyskeywolfe> This is why you get sick
[3:16:48] <RickyRelucent> Like indians hewing into the earth to store shit at lower temperatures
[3:16:49] <%heartlesshealer> summer attic is awful space

[3:17:08] <HotSauceFiend> like a bomb sheleter?
[3:17:09] <Invlux> I've got a lot of family from NJ and most everyone has their casual living rooms in the basement
[3:17:11] <+InhumanMilitia> pat joins the ranks of chucky and leprechaun
[3:17:17] <Hick12> Attic is for degens. Basements are for cool teens.
[3:17:18] <Profmcstevie> Could I get a semi detached, semi above the ground
[3:17:21] <+wizard_of_diamonds> It was fun earlier when we only heard Plague's every other word LUL
[3:17:28] <%heartlesshealer> no, company wants to buy that property first and build a single room apartment renting out for $1000
[3:17:39] <+waltzqueen> @Hick12 not true! attic is also for cottage core people
[3:17:57] <DillWillCat> Eli‚Äôs Monster Girl Pageant Basement Bonanza
[3:17:59] <Oxybe> I lived in a basement with bad water drainage. every summer the snow that pooled by the terrible window would melt and the whole thing would flood.

[3:19:56] <Oxybe> Nickelback also has enough songs to be a musical, but is that really a good idea?
[3:20:19] <+RealThiele> LOOK AT THIS PHOTOGRAPH
[3:20:22] <+DeaconBluesClues> @paige appearantly there was some song they would always sing at the end of their concerts; a non English one maybe not on albums according to my dad

[3:23:55] <Noahccountingfortaste> show me NOED Blood Warden
[3:24:07] <Invlux> LUL

[3:24:15] <DillWillCat> Kind killers should be a forced event
[3:24:21] <freelancebabymaker> the edgelord has returned
[3:24:25] <BigFingerRo> "Ok break it a lil bit"
[3:25:02] <BigFingerRo> That looks like how I imagine road workers operate in montreal, going by how pat talks about it
[3:25:46] <@SoFarFetched> damn paige blocking his pallet DansGame
[3:26:03] <+korsoupp> Hey paige yyjSUPERPOG
[3:26:20] <RickyRelucent> Suddenly i'm thinking of Paige doing a playtrough of haunting grounds

[3:28:27] <Dunmarkh> @Broand it's ninja from fortnite
[3:28:38] <+RealThiele> secret koreans LUL
[3:28:46] <cyclog> God I love this cooperation
[3:28:54] <cyclog> Its like a assembly line of experience dispersal
[3:28:58] <RickyRelucent> the music is so jarring with the confetti sounds
[3:29:09] <RickyRelucent> or the other way around, rather
[3:29:17] <cyclog> really terrifying assembly line but hilarious at the same time.
[3:29:37] <biglomix> At what point is it still a game?
[3:29:40] <@SoFarFetched> BALOOON PARTYYY
[3:29:47] <DillWillCat> Hero Legend Kind Killer Mega Lord

[3:31:05] <@SoFarFetched> and EVERYONE had "fun"
[3:31:11] <mikeriffic> shaaaammmme
[3:31:12] <Armadelus> @PeachSaliva I really dig your BRB screen, just thought I'd say something positive my first time here.
[3:31:19] <DillWillCat> Best Killer hands down.
[3:31:22] <Dakuu75> what if they added a mechanic where, 2 ppl getting 1 person off the hook, would give them more health than 1 person?
[3:31:26] <Invlux> Console pleb LUL
[3:31:28] <@SoFarFetched> Everyone just needs to get those bloodpoints while they can because DbD is a HUGE grind.
[3:31:28] <jemeralddragoon> Barf
[3:31:29] <+Mendin> The only thing I dislike about this even is that I'm trying to P3 Nemsis so all the cakes I'm getting are going to go to waste if I dont stay at 50 and burn them before prestiging
[3:32:28] <$Puhff> eli is 8% better at DbD than Paggliacci, confirmed
[3:32:36] <Dakuu75> it's like, 1:30am for her. (idk if Plague is east or west coast
[3:32:41] <+Mendin> check a look
[3:32:45] <cs0402196> I'd try to join but the strongest piece of technology is a Switch, and Switch Apex feels horrible, I don't wanna try DBD.
[3:32:56] <SGrim> @Dakuu75 Plague is mountain time. 1 hour behind east coast
[3:33:07] <RickyRelucent> Plagues 21 years my senior, huh
[3:33:09] <@Jekado> like copa cabana song is pretty depressing
[3:33:12] <Laioken13> always turns out to be sex
[3:33:14] <blue8moon> mountain time is 2 hours behind east coast
[3:33:14] <%AncelDeLambert> I really liked Edge of Seventeen, and then I read the lyrics
[3:33:17] <RickyRelucent> Doesn't sound it
[3:33:19] <Dakuu75> @SGrim of course he is... (i'll never remember that) lol
[3:33:21] <%AncelDeLambert> and holy crap the lyrics are meaningless
[3:33:23] <+TruKiryu> When farming happens for me it kinda takes me back, its difficult to know when its a super sweaty game or a farming one. Even after 100 hours
[3:33:24] <+Mendin> Mountain time is 2 behind east coast and I think Plague is in Kentucky which is Eastern
[3:33:36] <blue8moon> Central is 1 hour behind
[3:33:42] <SGrim> @Mendin Central is two hours behind east coast
[3:33:43] <blue8moon> east coast*
[3:33:45] <Oxybe> See that girl, watch her stream, Diggin' mustard queen~
[3:33:49] <Dakuu75> torch?
[3:34:06] <+Mendin> Where the heck are you, the northeastern tip of canada?
[3:34:18] <blue8moon> Mountain time is 2 hours behind east coast
[3:34:28] <@SoFarFetched> plague's cornfields are just too huge and ruining the signal
[3:34:35] <mikeriffic> oh did you THINK you met him?
[3:34:35] <+whyskeywolfe> No, he's a shared delusion.
[3:35:00] <SGrim> Wait, I got them backwards. Plague is still 1 hour behind, but he's in central not mountain.
[3:35:10] <Profmcstevie> Don't be mean to yourself, it takes the fun out of us doing it barbChad
[3:35:18] <jetpack_rorschasch> What if Plague is really just a figment of our collective imaginations? WutFace
[3:35:33] <Zourath> Plague's totally real, it's not like he's Woolie or some other myth like that.
[3:35:35] <biglomix> Thats every state
[3:35:36] <Dakuu75> what'd Max spend on his personal fiber? like... a house?
[3:35:40] <Laioken13> wish my part of the state got fiber
[3:35:56] <Profmcstevie> The mustard hallucinations
[3:36:06] <cyclog> WAKE UP PAGE YOU HAVE BEEN IN A COMA FOR 20 YEARS THIS IS NOT REAL
[3:36:06] <+whyskeywolfe> Max lives in LA though. Fiber happens there.
[3:36:08] <%Chichen> "What if you're part of my mind?" "I'm dropping a lot of frames" "Yep. My mind."
[3:36:11] <+whyskeywolfe> Or he did, at least.
[3:36:34] <Profmcstevie> We'll get you out of there Eli hboxPray
[3:36:41] <+SaphronBlackbourne> Thinking about when Eli was echoey and sounded like God
[3:36:46] <Zourath> Man, a figment of your mind insulted your hand turkey. How embarassing.
[3:36:56] <%Chichen> stream die?
