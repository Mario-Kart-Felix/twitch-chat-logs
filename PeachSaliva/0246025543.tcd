My mother, having already heard the zombie horror stories, had them look for the alternative, which was Adderall. I learned as an adult not only did I NOT need it, but it would have had the desired effect (which was focus on schoolwork) regardless of if I had it or not.

[1:38:51] <%Melchior_the_Wise> Denny's is still way nicer than Waffle House
[1:38:52] <%pikebot> Pat there are fucking Dennys in Japan for fuck's sake\
[1:38:52] <+FOGSHIE> Denny’s is trash, but it does the job.
[1:38:52] <+NeonLight> Was the hotel a La Quinta?
[1:38:52] <Grayhammatter> denny's is the biggest punchline
[1:38:53] <+XzileGaming> what are you TALKING about, we have Denny's in Canada
[1:38:54] <elementofloyalty> Ya'll
[1:38:54] <ArcticAsylum> WAFFLE HOUSE
[1:38:55] <%breakfastmegapowers> How much does Pat have to pay @PeachSaliva
[1:38:56] <TheImmortal70> Imagine a Toronto IHop

[1:38:58] <%potatodono_> it really is
[1:38:58] <+TsunamiPoro> you dont go to dennys, you end up there
[1:38:58] <Innocuous_Goat> "Forced"
[1:38:59] <+Hamblasto> Nooooooo. Waffle House makes Denny's look like a 5-star restaurant
[1:38:59] <Ell1ot> she would've done her level 3 super if it was a girl that asked
[1:39:00] <Minorou> nothing good ever happens at Denny's. I learned that from my law class
[1:39:00] <RafflesiaA> @Piemono That's pretty rough since Ihop is also trash
[1:39:00] <the_mental_punk> no ihop?\
[1:39:01] <count_bob> It's what Tim Horton's is, only good.
[1:39:02] <elementofloyalty> Camerl toe

[1:39:03] <CatmanIX> maybe Montreal don't have Denny's, but Canada definitely does
[1:39:04] <%Kataguro> It goes IHOP, Denny's, Waffle House
[1:39:04] <Sirchoff> pat would LOVE denny's
[1:39:05] <%superc37> @RafflesiaA for shooting the awful dark vegetables, ofc. gotta keep the produce fresh.

[1:39:06] <+OranHexthief> ohh waffle house is a treat LUL
[1:39:06] <+AntithesisEK> If you gave people a choice between Hell and a Denny's when they died they would gleefully choose an infernal underworld.
[1:39:07] <marsano168> You don't GO to Denny's you END UP at one
[1:39:07] <BenLubar> I like the IHOP commercial where they drive a plane through an IHOP
[1:39:07] <%genowyn> There are Denny's in Canada pat

[1:39:10] <Jman409> Denny’s is pathetic trash, but I’d rather go there than Waffle House
[1:39:11] <ThePuddingDead> "silly"
[1:39:12] <%Djinnazz> @PeachSaliva If you're there past 12 it's just hookers nad seriel Killers.
[1:39:13] <aslfrasle> Denny's tumblr is the biggest punchline.

[1:39:25] <%ziriken> Denny's is the place homeless people go to to get newspapers for their feet because mcdonald's kicks them out
[1:39:26] <$ReversalPsychology> because you're a tall redhead
[1:39:28] <Benpower236> Hookers don't need to be sexy, they just need to be hookers

[2:07:17] <RafflesiaA> @breakfastmegapowers She used all the healing she had on her
[2:07:19] <MainMan_Jonadiah> Literally "dig up stupid"
[2:07:22] <elementofloyalty> no it did not
[2:07:29] <Louie_Salmon> Does Paige ask you to roleplay as a skeleton in the bedroom @peachsaliva
[2:07:35] <%breakfastmegapowers> @RafflesiaA Even in her IT boxes?
[2:07:38] <Shazzlnet> not 'nothing'

[2:07:50] <RyuuAoi> DONT TAKE DAMAGE
[2:07:51] <%Djinnazz> nope
[2:07:53] <RedMaskBandit> Paige get health items from ur box!!!!!!
[2:07:54] <@Donutjulio> Muffet is honestly the least morally redeemable person in the game tbh
[2:07:55] <+JenovasPuppet> Buckle up! It's gonna be a hot minute!
[2:07:55] <ThePuddingDead> *bobs head to tune*
[2:07:56] <+Grithalmur> You have 3lanes
[2:07:56] <elementofloyalty> who are you two trying to convince?
[2:07:56] <the_phantom_theif> Paig
[2:07:57] <MellowYellowFellow> did she not buy from the spider bake sale?
[2:07:59] <+OdysseyKnight> Don't give her tactics. Just let her fail with futile acts
[2:07:59] <+TheShal> Ojou Spiders are UNSTOPPABLE.
[2:08:00] <%ziriken> Nah, Memory is better
[2:08:00] <%mitchteck> Buy items

[2:08:02] <%masterhobbes> head boops to this
[2:08:04] <+patriotrenegade> JUST DONT GET HIT
[2:08:04] <gyrogogozeppeli> I think Mettatton's is high up there too
[2:08:04] <RafflesiaA> @breakfastmegapowers She has some still, but they're in the box and there's little chance she'll remember to get them
[2:08:05] <alwayspronking> they aren't wrong
[2:08:07] <laguerrilha> When she loses the bet tell her about the donut
[2:08:07] <cizal11> she did, but she ate it way back
[2:08:08] <AlchemiBeast> its the same song as the dummy/ napstablook theme
[2:08:08] <ricksaintriot> what are you talking about? Muffet is fine
[2:08:08] <SplodeyJesus> carciSpooder carciSpooder carciSpooder
[2:08:09] <BenLubar> a lot of people THINK they like this track --Pat
[2:08:09] <+TMulharin> Not my favorite, but it's pretttyyyyy gooooodd
[2:08:10] <Klefth> There's better ones
[2:08:12] <+ThatGuyfromMars> asgore and save the world are definitely my favorite tracks tho
[2:08:12] <+SergeEXE> Paige does a good Muffet
[2:08:12] <@PlagueOfGripes> get caught in muffet's web, where she can do whatever she wants to you, and all you have to do is last long enough to satisfy her to survive
[2:08:12] <%blademaster247> Hopes and Dreams is the best though
[2:08:12] <VritraReiRei> @MellowYellowFellow she did, it's in her box though
[2:08:14] <%Keyd00d> This was a kickstarter backer's character too, was it not?
[2:08:16] <MissMalisin> moon2GUMS moon2GUMS moon2GUMS
[2:08:16] <ErraticPillow> if you buy from the first bake sale it only effects the end of this fight
[2:08:16] <+SolidusRex> Asgore is better
[2:08:18] <Greycandle> @MellowYellowFellow She did, but then she ate the donut.
[2:08:18] <PortableBoredom> Would YOU eat a spiderweb if it were prepared right?
[2:08:18] <%captainthunderwolf> Dude, Burgentrucken is the best song by a mile.
[2:08:18] <+Isthajore> Don't stop the fight! Keep the spiders on a roll.
[2:08:18] <umbracatalyst> Too cheap to help her local spiders!
[2:08:18] <thisisnotNR> TIDDIES UP THE WEB
[2:08:20] <+SergeEXE> "Yee Haw I'm gonna fuck that spider" - Plague
[2:08:20] <MellowYellowFellow> ahahah she's bones then

[3:50:41] <%ziriken> That donation was at 10:00 cdt
[3:50:43] <RantingRavager> Dogwelder has a deep and detailed, Yoko-taro-esque backstory. His story goes deep into themes that touch on the meaning of humanity and our relationship with animals. When he welds dogs, does he really actually explemplify the nature between humans and domesticated animals?
[3:50:44] <shmupdogjoe> errr
[3:50:50] <%ziriken> we got a ways to go
[3:50:50] <troxcree> Dogwelder 2 is apparently able to weld stars together through the power of dogs.

[3:54:12] <mercado94> "perfect"
[3:54:21] <SGrim> @PeachSaliva speaking as a tall man who tried squatty potty: the reason he might not like it is because his legs could be long enough to simulate squatting by simply sitting down on the toilet. Source: my experience.
