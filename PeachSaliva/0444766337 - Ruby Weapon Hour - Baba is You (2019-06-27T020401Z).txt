[1:33:21] <+skizzuto> @Osiren_Tv anything that paige does rn that looks like pulling is actually just rewinding previous moves

[1:43:52] <Hydrapissed> OMEGA stall
[1:43:53] <%Keyd00d> As a sub that's super dumb. Let everyone watch
[1:43:56] <%GabeSweetMan> People feel weirdly entitled to their favorite internet personalities.
[1:43:57] <%ElenaManetta> Why did they decide THAT was the breaking point to no longer be your fan
[1:43:58] <reonome> yeah it was undertale

[1:44:20] <GohanEgret> @Anonymasque raiden pls
[1:44:20] <BlackfyreRoy> Paige has the weakest stand, but it is effective. Stalling the inevitable.
[1:44:23] <Kazic5000> Don't put your dick in crazy
[1:44:28] <complicatedclarity> the crazy just appears around paige
[1:44:29] <Run44forrest> we dom only
[1:44:30] <Prism_Wing> Bullies were right!
[1:44:31] <LiquidMathew> I think she was submode for like 10 minutes even
[1:44:32] <fruit_pie_the_magician> hobbBeep
[1:44:32] <Kazic5000> Or crazy dick in you
[1:44:33] <+sadbagofmalformedmilk> bad choice
[1:44:35] <ProRJHunter> Totally fair
[1:44:36] <suikudo> I remember that dude on twitter
[1:44:36] <krymzen5> i remember that. chat was awful
[1:44:41] <Hydrapissed> I mean if its for a story game and u dont wana get spoiled
[1:44:41] <%depressed_skeleton> baaabaaa
[1:44:44] <+JenovasPuppet> Emote only stream
[1:44:45] <+KennyK> So you got bullied out of sub only mode?
[1:44:47] <%Keyd00d> Undertale chat is always terrible so sure
[1:44:53] <turf_wind_and_fire> That’s so dumb, if you want it to be in sub mode that’s totally fine. I don’t understand why people get so upset.
[1:45:02] <%JEiddew> no booli
[1:45:04] <%GabeSweetMan> It's not cool to discriminate against Doms Paige. Y'know some people just like being on top.
[1:45:04] <Deekman> Please do not put Paige in the position of teaching a cooking class
[1:45:06] <+skizzuto> once a month is how often we usually get streams
[1:45:06] <BobaFetish2124> wasn't during undertale?
[1:45:11] <+InstiGaitan> pls no booli paige
[1:45:12] <TezarroEX> i think sub only is fine, people are just super crazy
[1:45:13] <+KennyK> rooBooli No Booli
[1:45:15] <+cereal_box_conspiracy> I'm not blaming the mods, but it was all their fault.
[1:45:15] <+InstiGaitan> pls
[1:45:15] <Hydrapissed> it was prob during undertale
[1:45:18] <%ssjklyco> Burning down the House Cooking, with Paige
[1:45:19] <$Sphincter_Spelunker> It wasn't. Vocal minority
[1:45:19] <Laironx3> It was Delta Rune I think
[1:45:19] <%JEiddew> bold of you to assume all doms are tops
[1:45:19] <Skatedeandre> Its not something to start frothing at the mouth at
[1:45:19] <+thefruggler> Pat show bepis 😡
[1:45:20] <Hydrapissed> story mode shit people go ape shit
[1:45:21] <suikudo> Now to prove that she wasnt bullied she has to do subs only
[1:45:21] <krymzen5> people feel entitled to everything. it shouldn't be a big deal.
[1:45:22] <damienlunas> If it were me I'd put sub-only mode back on just to spite that jerk, but that's 'cause I'm also a jerk.
[1:45:22] <+KennyK> Please No Booli rooBooli
[1:45:24] <Dragon_Batman> That happens on Max's a bunch, where there are just shit heads that show up
[1:45:29] <Nina96> wait is was gone what happend?

[1:45:35] <Skatedeandre> You can be a Dom from the bottom?
[1:45:36] <Umberman> The POORS vs the SUBS
[1:45:38] <Hydrapissed> story games = sub mode guranteed

[1:55:38] <deviljhojho94> crikPog
[1:55:38] <cureneckbeard> Paige should play Dark Souls. There are some creatures in that which she would appreciate
[1:55:39] <$connos_procrastination> baBA IS SEEK
[1:55:39] <Dragon_Batman> That would be hilarious but probably the worst
[1:55:40] <+Binary_Fireball> Chat is just a super person a single entity of hmmmm
[1:55:41] <+BLK_HRLQN_13> Dark souls 2 when :3
[1:55:41] <buckwheat70> Gd that sucks for Pat if we’re as important as he is.
[1:55:42] <EuropantLamprey> We would get you stuck in the Burg
[1:55:46] <+KennyK> Didn't know I was supposed to be funny but thanks rooHug rooHug rooHug
[1:55:47] <$rdark_ksu> if you played DS without Pat you and the game would spontaneously combust

[1:55:51] <%hawk_rush> "This game's better than DS1"
[1:55:53] <Kiari13> yeah jermaPluto

[1:55:58] <%TeraMercier> That's what God did with your penis pat
[1:55:58] <+mh9s> don't measure, don't cut, just buy a fucking bag
[1:55:58] <CrypticMochi> Will chat be a IRL GPS one day?
[1:55:58] <krymzen5> yea it is LUL
[1:55:59] <JanusII> Paige does a normal stream downstairs, Pat does a sub only stream upstairs reacting to Paige playing without any help.
[1:56:00] <iamnolionheart> But Pat I did that and it was still too small
[1:56:00] <Monkeyweed21> 2 levels 2 hours
[1:56:02] <GarbageQueenEllie> You can do it bababa
[1:56:02] <+linSP> holy shit dark souls 2 would be the ultimate test
[1:56:02] <LiquidMathew> I still have my home ec bag somewhere lol
[1:56:03] <ReiDuran> @PeachSaliva Hope you end up playing Ace Attorney eventually because it is good.
[1:56:03] <cureneckbeard> PAT is SENSIBLE
[1:56:04] <%ssjklyco> You have it in the bag
[1:56:06] <Mr_Strut> hoes sad

[1:56:27] <Run44forrest> keep stalling
[1:56:27] <PlainSimpleTailor> That is how I know you go on?
[1:56:28] <+talfurt> Pat should stream himself watching Paige play ds2
[1:56:29] <Kazic5000> That's fair
[1:56:29] <agrippaarpeggio> WE HEAR YOU GAMERS
[1:56:29] <%Angry_Ev1L> is it more pathetic than skeleton dating visual novel? xenoThinking
[1:56:29] <AlexanderTheConquerer> remember that ff4 stream that was 20 minutes gameplay sandwiched in 3 hours of donation reads
[1:56:30] <TezarroEX> tbh, if this is the kind of games you usually play, I don't blame you talking month long breaks
[1:56:30] <+Tyonidus> BUT SHE CAN'T SEE THEM HALF THE TIME LUL
[1:56:30] <sileo_patronus> ?????
[1:56:30] <+bread_assassin> The fact that the game's on is really just a formality at this point.
[1:56:31] <%ssjklyco> This stream is the best
[1:56:33] <%TheLakinessMonster> Is she sober yet?
[1:56:34] <Monkeyweed21> Paige is Stall
[1:56:35] <Skatedeandre> This stream is only 10% gameplay
[1:56:36] <+Gruntini> STALLING
[1:56:36] <+KinkyWalrus069> BABA IS PODCAST
[1:56:37] <+Arkfyre> First you hear and then you see
[1:56:37] <$Agami23> isnt that was pat says when someone is being nuts???
[1:56:38] <Lady_M91> If I want straight gameplay I'll just get the game myself, I'm here for the stream.
[1:56:40] <%JEiddew> paige is valid as fuck
[1:56:40] <$Mendin> @PeachSaliva Pat if she ever plays DS2 you'd better get her the DLC Chicken Wing ASAP for big and strong goals
[1:56:43] <$FrostMass22> Paige can't see her friends because she is blind
[1:56:43] <Dhurkst> DECISION is VALID
[1:56:44] <+miguelrod777> STALL

[2:43:07] <PrettyThickandStrongDyck> Pat advice ✓
[2:43:07] <Habblewater> Jerk off with your therapist
[2:43:11] <FatherGreyBeard> Pat the S-rank counselor
[2:43:12] <$Bncbck> i've been suicidal for 13 years and the jerking off thing does occasionally help

[2:47:00] <$RubberFistFight> @StrawberryPantsu chances are he'd win because he's mentioned before he's totally willing to fight dirty. Remember the story about him biting a kid's face?
[2:47:01] <+Forente> It is better not to know
[2:47:01] <$connos_procrastination> Go to the debonaire instead and stream it
