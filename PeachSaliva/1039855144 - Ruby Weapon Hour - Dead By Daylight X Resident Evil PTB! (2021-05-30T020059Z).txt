[0:24:38] <teras_kasi> Is Zuul in the fridge?
[0:24:39] <spoopymcspoops16> It is haunted
[0:24:39] <Brunothebodyguard> space is at the window coming for you
[0:24:40] <%TheWinged7> what looks like a person in the window is just Peaches reflection guys
[0:24:40] <BalterEgo> evil ghost Abe making an appearance again
[0:24:41] <HUGOMASTRPICE> what are we cooking?
[0:24:42] <MrChaosDoughnut> Ghosts are everywhere.
[0:24:46] <VritraReiRei> it's not about what they "like." its about how they are handled in each country. USA supermarket eggs you HAVE to refrigerate eggs or they will go bad
[0:24:47] <SheefEatsBeef> this is a live horrror murder camera angle
[0:24:47] <bigfastkaratedealership> You put the tomato in the fridge after you’ve used half of it for one dish
[0:24:48] <%firewhiskeys> i did think your reflection in the window was a ghost
[0:24:49] <+Captain_Spicy_> LMAO, it's actually Peach's reflection
[0:24:49] <thevoiceofcheese> Why is it so dark in there
[0:24:50] <+PR0swagonist> is she not in canada land?
[0:24:50] <+shupshup2121> not todABE
[0:24:51] <TrashManJonesy> Is there always a baby crawling around on the walls there? Or is that just me?
[0:24:51] <+BubbaRands> Sleep Paralysis Abe says Four Score!
[0:24:52] <postmortempc> You should make Lincoln’s favorite dish to summon him
[0:24:52] <+everslime> 4 score and 16  ghost ago
[0:24:53] <KeiganOfAstora> It's not a better or worse thing. It depends on how fast you go through your vegetables
[0:24:57] <BalterEgo> ghosts get hungry too
[0:24:58] <+Nomad_Scholar> Who the hell doesn't have blinds on their windows?
[0:24:58] <skrewarrior> the only thing outside is space

[0:44:35] <%bazzabarra> despite knowing it I love all dogs
[0:44:38] <RenniGlo> Honestly Dalmations are pretty af but they can be gnarly af
[0:44:39] <%king_wragles> Fun fact: dalmatians can develop psychological issues before they hit 16 months!

[1:04:35] <+BubbaRands> That's gotta be expensive for real vanilla extract
[1:04:37] <%dankjerri> eli's wild strawberries
[1:04:37] <Sotetsu> What is stone fruit?
[1:04:38] <@MelBrooksKA> Don't think I've every eaten straight butter although I do remember when I accidentally put Crisco on my pancakes instead of butter...

[1:05:39] <thevoiceofcheese> Tart
[1:05:47] <%walternatorz> banana bread stream next
[1:05:52] <$Sphincter_Spelunker> tart is like a less intense sour
[1:05:52] <%dankjerri> its what health tastes like
[1:05:53] <NawsCire> sort of a rich slightly tart and mushy berry
[1:05:57] <+BubbaRands> not yet
[1:05:58] <+fatal_penguin_> Banana Bread is solid
[1:05:58] <Ozavic> That's fine, though I do feel that bananas and strawberries are so damn good together
[1:05:59] <%Ashrox117> @fairore Youtube show where guests eat progressively hotter wings and answer questions. Paige and Pat should do a version where they just talk smack to each other the whole time though
[1:06:00] <JohnClaggart> they're about right
[1:06:01] <+barristerofthebar> They pretty ripe
[1:06:01] <%BulbasaursCry> Spotty nanners = best nanners
[1:06:04] <+BubbaRands> NEED TO BE SOFTER
[1:06:08] <NawsCire> like a less sour grape that isn't as TIGHT
[1:06:16] <mastermidget23> I just got here, when do we add the glass to the batter?
[1:06:21] <%dankjerri> mash that fuckin nan hardcore style

[1:06:24] <fairore> @ashrox117 ohh
[1:06:31] <Nelsukako> the backseat here is strong
[1:06:33] <jorniev> PAIGE there is a mouse in your kitchen!
[1:06:33] <LoliKappa> every good cooking stream involves a gaming mouse
[1:06:34] <%walternatorz> the production values
[1:06:35] <Ozavic> Anywho, going to go hang with the boyf, don't tell the Canadian Government
[1:06:36] <Explodincatz> cook the mouse
[1:06:36] <Wiiplayah43> It's weird how the best cooking nanners are too ripe for raw consumptions
[1:06:37] <$LifesNeverHumDrum> @NawsCire ooh girl your grape is so TIGHT
[1:06:41] <+fatal_penguin_> Butter up that mouse for smoother scrolling
[1:06:41] <JohnClaggart> peel the blueberries, paige
[1:06:41] <%dankjerri> OH MAN THIS IS GREAT
[1:06:45] <%BulbasaursCry> Paige are you okay

[1:07:08] <mr_saturday93> I keep hearing wizz like she needs to pee
[1:07:09] <%walternatorz> do you need to have chat look for it?
[1:07:11] <+Golinvoxx> Cooking Stream, aka watch a poor streaming go crazy over losing all the things
[1:07:12] <%sleepy_coffee> psshhhhh when in doubt use your hands
[1:07:14] <GravyLangley> wwwwwhhiiiiisskkkuhh
[1:07:15] <NawsCire> @LifesNeverHumDrum oh goodness gapecious me oh my how tight yo are
[1:07:16] <%THATGUY_789> use fork my gal
[1:07:17] <postmortempc> Just use your hands
[1:07:18] <%bazzabarra> feeels like this recipe is too rough for anyone streaming who isn't used to it
[1:07:22] <%BulbasaursCry> All the cool kids use whisks
[1:07:22] <+Auritus> it's the whisk in one of your many pockets?
[1:07:25] <%Ashrox117> @fairore Np, it’s where the Shaq reaction face meme came from lol
[1:07:26] <Coystick> Forks>whisks
[1:07:27] <+fatal_penguin_> Wisk with that butcher knife
[1:07:29] <$Sphincter_Spelunker> whisks are a pain in the ass to wash anyway
[1:07:40] <j_shents> You need a Sieve 😂
[1:07:40] <$LifesNeverHumDrum> @AdeptusExterminatus this is her mum's place
[1:07:41] <%dankjerri> she's so fast, i see like 7 hands
[1:07:41] <Sotetsu> What are you whisking together?
[1:07:42] <@MelBrooksKA> It's fine
[1:07:42] <Zyczenn> poor mouse
[1:07:42] <JohnClaggart> whisks work in more air
[1:07:43] <NawsCire> god damn the rum is hitting way faster than I thought it would
[1:07:43] <twistedj3ster> someone take a screenshot, photoshop an abe lincoln ghost in the window, and send it to her
[1:07:47] <%dankjerri> its the secret technique
[1:07:47] <Explodincatz> F mouse
[1:07:48] <%BulbasaursCry> Is that flour on the mouse?
[1:07:48] <%walternatorz> you're flouring your mouse.
[1:07:52] <SilverFaustX> nice 10fps
[1:07:53] <critiquequartz> That apron is really cuts
[1:07:56] <critiquequartz> Cute
[1:07:57] <%bazzabarra> i prefer using two forks to whisk
[1:07:57] <dan_g_v> Happy little mistakes
[1:07:58] <fluffy_sauce> that poor mouse!
[1:08:01] <+fatal_penguin_> Your hair can act as a wisk in a pinch
[1:08:03] <JohnClaggart> use more of your elbow for a fork whisking
[1:08:05] <fairore> @ashrox117 oh I didn't know  that
[1:08:07] <Coystick> Real gamer cooking
[1:08:07] <%bazzabarra> for a newb it seems easier
[1:08:09] <jorniev> A mouse! in the kitchen!
[1:08:10] <shadowslygaming> no whisk, bread flour....the shit show has begun
[1:08:11] <AdeptusExterminatus> @LifesNeverHumDrum Ohhhhhh, thanks!
[1:08:14] <NawsCire> you should put the bob ross stream on in the background
[1:08:18] <%dankjerri> too thick or too thin?
[1:08:23] <+Golinvoxx> you gotta hit those QTE's if you want the dough to come out good
[1:08:25] <fluffy_sauce> no electric mixer?
[1:08:27] <Dr_Mooose> confidence!
[1:08:27] <Sotetsu> Have you baked on a professional level?
[1:08:27] <T_Sasquatch> Where is paige ?

[1:08:39] <+Dives__> dummy thicc
[1:08:41] <$LifesNeverHumDrum> @JohnClaggart ok i know what you meant, but i thought for a second "shove your elbow in there and whisk with it"
[1:08:42] <JohnClaggart> it's supposed to be thick if you used bread flour
[1:08:43] <+MasterGeneralVic> 100% confidence
[1:08:48] <jorniev> amn i love cooking
[1:08:48] <%dankjerri> hab conpidance

[1:09:01] <%Caidezes> Add more confidence.
[1:09:01] <%dankjerri> more butter
[1:09:02] <Cpt_phantom> The mouse is absorbing too much moisture
[1:09:03] <+fatal_penguin_> Make Pancakes paige
[1:09:04] <+BubbaRands> thinner?
[1:09:15] <Meekest> It's so easy to bake a pretty cake
[1:09:15] <$Sphincter_Spelunker> too much macaroni
[1:09:16] <+senfood> Yo, what's on the menu?
[1:09:16] <afrobean18> big confidence you are doing great
[1:09:16] <%dankjerri> yeyeye

[1:09:19] <+barristerofthebar> uh prob not
[1:09:21] <karlitasunrise> Julia Child would be proud 👏
[1:09:22] <%dankjerri> milk will thin it too much
[1:09:26] <PageofHeart> Gotta do the Star Wars Christmas Special: stir, whip, stir, whip, whip, whip stir.
[1:09:27] <+Fooguwu> needs mold
[1:09:27] <+OmegaWeltall> ALL the butter
[1:09:28] <JohnClaggart> butter would make it worse
[1:09:29] <%dankjerri> balanxe gluten with fat
[1:09:29] <NawsCire> its THICK
[1:09:33] <+ratchetex> what did you say this was called?
[1:09:40] <jerree66> Butter is always good
[1:09:43] <Coystick> For the love of fuck gotta do the cooking by the book
[1:09:45] <Wiiplayah43> like every stream lol
[1:09:46] <spacebowie749> paula deen had too much butter, and that mad her racist
[1:09:48] <%Ranryu692> so every stream?
[1:09:48] <karlitasunrise> it's all good
[1:09:49] <%brokendarktower> you can do it
[1:09:49] <trianglehat> sounds like any other stream :)
[1:09:51] <%bazzabarra> rule #1 to cooking
[1:09:52] <%walternatorz> Pat's sixth sense is tingling right now.

[1:11:23] <+kapcommunist> big pancake
[1:11:24] <Aleate> The super Pancake Pog
[1:11:25] <+OmegaWeltall> is she making some sort of tart?
[1:11:27] <videogamegeffy> needs more bones
[1:11:27] <%bazzabarra> if you can make something tasty while experimenting you feel soo goood
[1:11:29] <fairore> @coystick listen  I never  really watched  lazy town  dont hurt me
[1:11:30] <fritz_dacat> Did you grease that pan
[1:11:32] <$Sphincter_Spelunker> in your mouth
[1:11:32] <%ClericOfSparda> that's a lot
[1:11:33] <$LifesNeverHumDrum> i dont think skillet go in oven but im not a mathmagician
[1:11:43] <Vyskus> y'all peel your pancakes before you eat them?
[1:11:46] <%dankjerri> theres enough butter in there that it should be fine.
[1:11:48] <%Ashrox117> @wiiplayah43 Well there’s always something in a pot in them
[1:11:49] <+barristerofthebar> That's a KNIFE
[1:11:50] <%bazzabarra> skillet do go in ovenj
[1:11:52] <+fatal_penguin_> Is the Midwest, everythings greasy already @fritz_dacat
[1:11:55] <%bazzabarra> for some recipes
[1:11:55] <+Seitine> Depends on if it's oven safe yo
[1:11:57] <Coystick> Cats paw cats paw watch ur fingers
[1:12:02] <+gregpivo> What's cooking anyway?
[1:12:03] <jorniev> you can use bananas for that recipeh?
[1:12:09] <rekinom> ayyyy clafoutis! Thanks for introducing me to this recipe
[1:12:12] <Sotetsu> Is the batter just milk, butter, eggs, and flour?
[1:12:16] <+barristerofthebar> @Seitine Can't imagine it is
[1:12:17] <Wiiplayah43> tiny berries HUGE KNIFE
[1:12:20] <%walternatorz> did this kitchen come fully stocked?
[1:12:22] <+BubbaRands> Wait is Clafoutis just a dutch baby?!
[1:12:23] <%dankjerri> get some juice in there, hand crush some of those bad boys
[1:12:43] <@MelBrooksKA> If only there was a paring knife back there
[1:12:44] <%BulbasaursCry> It looks like a giant chocolate chip pancake
[1:12:46] <NawsCire> its ok paige use the knife you are comfotable with
[1:12:50] <+fatal_penguin_> I feel like tearing up the berries would be easier
[1:12:56] <ShinBojangles> At what point do you start using the Dorito powder and bacon?
[1:12:56] <%firewhiskeys> gotta find royalty free cool jazz
[1:13:01] <Sotetsu> Just sing some jazz tunes
[1:13:02] <LoliKappa> drop your shield
[1:13:03] <%BulbasaursCry> make the berries feel pain before you cook them
[1:13:03] <%dankjerri> what about some classical
[1:13:04] <rekinom> Line up a bunch of 'em and use the whole knife! (dont do that)
[1:13:04] <%Promessa_EX> there's creative commons stuff you could use
[1:13:04] <%bazzabarra> surely there are free jazz tracks
[1:13:04] <+sniffy77> paige do exactly what ur doing
[1:13:08] <%ospreyworks> you could use something like Pretzel Rocks. all stream safe music.
[1:13:08] <Coystick> Paige that one on the right is crooked
[1:13:09] <$LifesNeverHumDrum> but can we ROAST you?
[1:13:12] <Srthunda> I thought this stream was for back seating
[1:13:12] <+fatal_penguin_> Have you tried clafoutis with mcdonalds fries on top Paige

[1:25:37] <Coystick> "You better not be keeping slaves in here"
[1:25:38] <Wiiplayah43> If it's Eli, the ghost of Jack Baker haunts that oven.
[1:25:44] <+Toshatron> "NO Abe the recipe says 30 mins!"
[1:25:46] <$Sphincter_Spelunker> Did your fear of Abe Lincoln come from Twin Peaks or Star Trek?
[1:25:49] <+fatal_penguin_> hahaha @Coystick

[1:25:56] <atgithursdays> @PeachSaliva Did you know there are certain ghost shows that assert that you can only see ghosts on camera, not with our eyes? So we could see ghosts and you could not'
[1:25:57] <NawsCire> you weren't

[1:26:10] <$cactus_gato> my partner and I work opposite schedules, he works at night so I'm home alone. it's fuck all terrifying sometimes, especially in an old creeky house
[1:26:10] <fairore> piage is curse
[1:26:15] <+doc_ock_rokc> Paige has a stand
[1:26:16] <+Plaguemelon> Maybe you should get exorcised
[1:26:19] <MetroidSlayerP7> "I'm back from the play.  what's I miss?"
[1:26:26] <Cpt_phantom> Paige is cursed

[1:26:46] <$cactus_gato> idea: mom's meatloaf and thenf
[1:26:48] <postmortempc> Will you mustard the loaf?
[1:26:49] <@MelBrooksKA> @Medrex She is not
[1:26:50] <twistedj3ster> @Medrex Oh interesting! Thanks
[1:26:51] <Aleate> But just think of how good the meatloaf is going to be tfuFat
[1:26:53] <robobeau> Time to break out the wine
[1:26:57] <%dankjerri> I would maybe wait for Momma Peach to be on standby
[1:27:05] <$cactus_gato> mom's meat loaf and then for breakfast have it with eggies tomorrow
[1:27:11] <JohnClaggart> T or t
[1:27:14] <$LifesNeverHumDrum> lowercase or upper case?
[1:27:15] <%firewhiskeys> meatloaf is pretty easy, though. it's hard to mess up
[1:27:16] <Srthunda> is it a big T or small t
[1:27:18] <$Sphincter_Spelunker> T or t yeah
[1:27:20] <+barristerofthebar> erbs
[1:27:20] <Dr_Mooose> just erbs
[1:27:22] <Wiiplayah43> urbz
[1:27:24] <CaptainBuddy15> glad you are haunted someone needs to be
[1:27:28] <Dr_Angelic> generally if it's a lowercase t (teaspoon), and a capital T is (tablespoon) sometimes
[1:27:29] <+fatal_penguin_> burbs
[1:27:30] <$hrbeck_> ms dash, probably
[1:27:31] <Vyskus> just use some grass
[1:27:32] <%dankjerri> probably basil, cilantro, and thyme
[1:27:33] <%vivaciouseff> vivaciouseff subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 8 months! hell yea food stream
[1:27:35] <JohnClaggart> yes meatloaf uses ketchup, paige

[1:27:37] <Cpt_phantom> Just a bag of erbs
[1:27:37] <CandyCoatedConfection> no t TJ Maxx herbs 😅
[1:27:43] <renyrells> i put BBQ sauce in my meatloaf js
[1:27:46] <JetpackMcQuack> Aw jeez
[1:27:48] <critiquequartz> That how you know it’s a family recipe you can’t read/ decode it
[1:27:50] <%Ashrox117> “ground flower” herbs 😉
[1:27:53] <+gregpivo> Either T or t, or split the difference and use 1.5 teaspoons
[1:27:54] <+fatal_penguin_> does your meatloaf use ketchup Paige
[1:27:58] <Jetsfantasy> Yeah, directions from someone who cooks by "feel" isn't helpful LUL
[1:28:01] <Zeif00> Could look up a preexisting meatloaf recipe to compare and contrast with your mom's
[1:28:04] <+lethallylactic> I use Campbell's tomato soup :)
[1:28:09] <%dankjerri> I put Mozzerella in my loaf
[1:28:11] <%firewhiskeys> we like to crush up doritos into our meatloaf sometimes
[1:28:11] <+doc_ock_rokc> Meatloaf is okay
[1:28:19] <$LifesNeverHumDrum> at least your mom writes her recipe DOWN
[1:28:22] <Coystick> The family recipe requires that you dance while whisking
[1:28:23] <+doc_ock_rokc> but im not a big fan
[1:28:28] <$rdark_ksu> family recipes rely on genetic memory Paige, its in your jeans
[1:28:34] <%dankjerri> sodium *deficient* loaf
[1:28:37] <Dr_Angelic> @critiquequartz Or if it has a million notes in the side of a recipe on cooking tips or taste or substitutions written in years worth of pencil/pen
[1:28:42] <sackerkappa> So the Anti-Pat, no salt at all.
[1:28:42] <Coystick> Sodiumloaf

[1:36:52] <+agomera666> you guys visiting Eli?
[1:36:55] <@commanderclaw> Pat and Woolie didn't know what a Nutter Butter was and were grossed out by it, I don't trust their food opinions
[1:36:57] <%Ashrox117> I’M STILL MAD ABOUT PEANUT BUTTERGATE
[1:36:58] <JetpackMcQuack> Great
[1:36:59] <+Plaguemelon> room temp water makes me gag

[1:37:24] <%sumrand0> Room Temperature Glass or do you prefer your broken glass chilled
[1:37:25] <Wiiplayah43> @commanderclaw That's some SERIOUS heresy.
[1:37:28] <JetpackMcQuack> Food goes bad so fast
[1:37:32] <+OmegaWeltall> oh between lil V and Woolie
[1:37:32] <$Sphincter_Spelunker> @commanderclaw was it nutter butter or a fluffer nutter?
[1:37:34] <%dankjerri> OH FUCK
[1:37:41] <%TheWinged7> no, the natural oily one
[1:37:41] <%dankjerri> NOT THE PEANUT BUTTER
[1:37:43] <councilmechanica> Yo that kitchen is fucking sick Paige
[1:37:44] <@commanderclaw> Natural versus artificial
[1:37:44] <Wiiplayah43> @Ranryu692 then you've never had good peanut butter
[1:37:45] <%Ashrox117> Natural vs hydrogenated
[1:37:45] <IminyourBase> peanut butter with the honey in it
[1:37:46] <%dankjerri> NO THE OIL
[1:37:46] <+Walopoh> George Washington Carver talked shit about the podcast
[1:37:46] <+gregpivo> Does someone refrigerate their peanut butter?
[1:37:47] <AllonBachuth> Woolie was right about peanut butter, Lil V is super wrong
[1:37:48] <@MelBrooksKA> Little V old fashion peanut butter versus modern
[1:37:48] <+HiroTSK5> Jiff versus actual peanut butter
[1:37:48] <+Kindan55> How dare u
[1:37:50] <ergulor> for bees
[1:37:50] <%AyotoCorp> Wasn't Little V the crazy one there though
[1:37:50] <+logoth_> No HE DIDNT
[1:37:50] <+fatal_penguin_> Crunchy or creamy peanut butter, Chat?
[1:37:52] <Zeif00> THE BEES
[1:37:53] <CandyCoatedConfection> crunchy all the way. it's the best.
[1:37:53] <lloyddboy> BEENUT BUTTER
[1:37:53] <%walternatorz> oh god that stupid dream
[1:37:54] <$cactus_gato> smooth peanut butter with cheese is good
[1:37:54] <%Ranryu692> @Wiiplayah43 because it doesn't exist
[1:37:54] <+agomera666> no, it was natural vs pre-mixed
[1:37:56] <thunka10> what? WHAT?
[1:37:58] <Valkryna> That is accurate
[1:37:59] <phantalime> woolie shits on real peanut butter and prefers plastic stuff
[1:37:59] <IrishWeegee> listen now, crunchy is amazing
[1:38:00] <%sumrand0> OH FUCK NOT THIS AGAIN PAIGE I JUST FORGOT
[1:38:01] <TheZearGuy> Makes sense
[1:38:01] <PlebianNoob> What?
[1:38:02] <waterstealer> no, its' oily penut butter vs smooth jif
[1:38:03] <+Medrex> nah little v was talking about that peanut butter where the oil seprates and you have to remix it
[1:38:04] <+Cl0udation> while i love crunchy, hearing that is great
[1:38:05] <$LifesNeverHumDrum> i choked on my spit, was not expecting that
[1:38:07] <Cpt_phantom> Paige, don’t do this
[1:38:08] <IminyourBase> bruh that is significant
[1:38:08] <supergoblinpunch> lily v was claiming oily PB supremacy
[1:38:09] <CandyCoatedConfection> crunchy is best
[1:38:10] <+CatsEyeBlind> That's fair, Scrooge is a bastard some times
[1:38:13] <Dr_Mooose> never forgive that duck

[1:38:54] <%sumrand0> I hate my brain for remembering that story
[1:38:55] <+shyguysupreme> So i just got here what is paige even talking about
[1:38:55] <Wiiplayah43> Woolie is convinced that sugary peanut spread is real PB, and actual real PB is bad because he's used to sugar
[1:38:56] <+fatal_penguin_> Would bees be crunchy is a sandwich
[1:38:56] <+gregpivo> 100% fair

[1:39:02] <%bassoontyphoon> Man a therapist could get multiple phDs trying to decipher your psyche
[1:39:02] <iosephe> Did Abraham Lincoln give you the beewich
[1:39:03] <wasdsf> what if you took a bite of the sandwich and it was space?
[1:39:04] <+AmanisHouseOfNonsense> Paige, why, of ALL characters, was it Scrooge McDuck???
[1:39:04] <$hrbeck_> Paige’s sexual awakening
[1:39:09] <Talyndemon> Well I mean Launchpad is the one to trust, obviously.  So good call.
[1:39:09] <%sumrand0> GODDAMN BEES
[1:39:09] <Cpt_phantom> That’s your own trauma, crunchy is superior
[1:39:10] <+doomunderthestairs> I can't believe we are seeing more than just the dungeon
[1:39:10] <Coystick> What if ur mom put bees in the meatloaf?
[1:39:10] <%dankjerri> there are bees in your dessert

[1:39:30] <$Draylle> that's nice Paige, let's get you to bed.
[1:39:31] <jorniev> hey remember when you fought, pat about a ham sandwich?
[1:39:31] <+Medrex> Crunchy peanut butter is bees.
[1:39:34] <+Jonny_Worldbeater> Bee-nut butter. AKA honey
[1:39:35] <CappuccinoGuil> @Sphincter_Spelunker Hold up, just a clarification: I AM crazy, but am I BEING crazy?
[1:39:38] <%dankjerri> psaMenace psaMenace psaMenace psaMenace
[1:39:38] <thbluewarden> it was Lincoln's ghost in disguise
[1:39:54] <TheZearGuy> Does the bees in the sandwich circle around to the worms in a burger?
[1:39:55] <+doomunderthestairs> and the hauntings of the dead presidents
[1:39:58] <+doomunderthestairs> jackson?
[1:39:58] <mustachegolem> I'm okay with eating bugs because I don't care about their suffering like I so with cows or pigs
[1:40:01] <$hrbeck_> Actual scrooge mcduck
[1:40:01] <@commanderclaw> This is a really nice kitchen, it's great
[1:40:02] <wasdsf> look out abraham lincoln is right behind you!
[1:40:07] <ttc_lover> Next bit
[1:40:11] <%sumrand0> My scary dreams are just always me existing and seeing the heat deathof the universe its super depressing and a bummer since its like....physics
[1:40:11] <+InternetShis> I'm glad we get to see the fourth room of the house on this stream
[1:40:12] <$Draylle> does it have a light?
[1:40:14] <%sleepy_coffee> Peach, was the scrouge bee dream after bringing the pie to the to the neighbors and their door was wasped up?
[1:40:14] <IminyourBase> turn on the oven light you can kind of see thru the glass when you do that
[1:40:14] <Sakanakao> hgoHappy
[1:40:15] <$Sphincter_Spelunker> @CappuccinoGuil depends. How long is the pan left without a lid?
[1:40:18] <Cpt_phantom> Paige, have you ever eaten bugs? It’s not as wild as you would think
[1:40:19] <twistedj3ster> I do it ALL THE TIME, it;s fine
[1:40:19] <%dankjerri> Abraham Lincoln, Paigepre hunter
[1:40:20] <+doomunderthestairs> I just made a cake and some peanutbutter chocolate chip cookies!
[1:40:23] <$cactus_gato> turn the oven light on :)
[1:40:24] <critiquequartz> Shine your phone flashlight in there
[1:40:24] <+fatal_penguin_> Ask the ghosts to check the pie for ya Paige
[1:40:26] <+InternetShis> Bit improved
[1:40:26] <Aleate> I like this bit more
[1:40:29] <critiquequartz> ??
[1:40:31] <%sumrand0> Intentionally
[1:40:33] <%dankjerri> 9 minutes
[1:40:35] <+Fep3> much better
[1:40:37] <+lethallylactic> DansGame
[1:40:40] <+Cl0udation> was introduced to this stream tonight....thank you so much
[1:40:41] <@commanderclaw> And those 1 million spiders we eat a year
[1:40:41] <PageofHeart> it took me until looking at the windows to notice this isnt the legendary basement kitchen of pat and paige's home.
[1:40:49] <%sumrand0> Never on a dare?!
[1:40:49] <%Promessa_EX> shoe on head really hates the bugs, i think its cool
[1:40:51] <%dankjerri> la cucaracha
[1:40:51] <+Medrex> do prawns count?
[1:40:52] <Wiiplayah43> supposedly, certain types of bugs are actually really good
[1:40:56] <17crawls1> Eyy first time catching you live in a long while!  Whatchya gonna cook?
[1:40:58] <CappuccinoGuil> @Sphincter_Spelunker I don't know, but long enough that the food is cold. And she cooks with no lids.
[1:41:06] <+fatal_penguin_> Chocolate covered bees?
[1:41:07] <%dankjerri> eat the cicada
[1:41:07] <jorniev> hachama is that vtuber that cooked a tarantula right?  would you eat that?
[1:41:10] <%Ashrox117> Bungers look pretty good tho
[1:41:18] <+InternetShis> Crawfish are good when the rich aren't around
[1:41:24] <%dankjerri> 8 minutes
[1:41:32] <%sumrand0> Pop a small black ant in my mouth NBD but vegetables are disgusting & tasteless im not a good measuring stick
[1:41:33] <+Medrex> problem is you can't shell most bugs. I'd be down for a lot more if you could
[1:41:37] <+InternetShis> Never forget what the rich did to brisket
[1:41:49] <%sumrand0> MUZAK
[1:41:49] <MetroidSlayerP7> I hear trantulas taste like crab
[1:41:50] <+fatal_penguin_> @InternetShis what did they do?
[1:42:00] <$Sphincter_Spelunker> @CappuccinoGuil being crazy. Even if it were flies, so what. There are worse things out there than flies.
[1:42:06] <%dankjerri> 7 minutes
[1:42:10] <Wiiplayah43> @sumrand0 try roasting veggies with olive oil, salt, & pepper
[1:42:13] <+Walopoh> I heard crabs taste like tarantulas
[1:42:22] <mustachegolem> crab and other sea things has the sea scent thi
[1:42:25] <%dankjerri> depends on the crab
[1:42:32] <mustachegolem> I feel like tarantulas wouldn't have that
[1:42:41] <%dankjerri> dungeoness and snow king have slightly different flavor
[1:42:41] <Cpt_phantom> Crabs aren’t my thing but they’re alright. Better when super fresh
[1:42:43] <iosephe> didn't she also eat a scorpion?
[1:42:44] <JohnClaggart> missing
[1:42:46] <Wiiplayah43> @Walopoh Not even close. Crab is great, tarantula is gross
[1:43:04] <mustachegolem> the hairs...
[1:43:06] <Wiiplayah43> @mustachegolem I've never gotten that impression tbh
[1:43:09] <+bottomlesscoffin> When you cook tarantula just right it falls off the exoskeleton
[1:43:18] <Wiiplayah43> @mustachegolem about cran I mean
[1:43:18] <%dankjerri> you ever just crush a claw with your bare hands?
[1:43:24] <Cpt_phantom> I’m not a fan of seafood, but if it’s super fresh I like it
[1:43:30] <%dankjerri> also, 6 minutes
[1:43:37] <$Sphincter_Spelunker> shellfish can be hit or miss. Prawns depending where they're caught can taste like mud
[1:43:42] <%sumrand0> I prefer absorption via osmosis
[1:43:50] <CappuccinoGuil> @Sphincter_Spelunker You are stronger at that than me. I don't like bugs near my food.

[1:57:32] <mike2hands> hmm idk
[1:57:34] <$Puhff> i do
[1:57:37] <$Puhff> flour is weird
[1:57:37] <tanarath> Are muffins cakes now, Paige?
[1:57:38] <derap41> BreadFlour just has more Gluten
[1:57:38] <WanderingYoren> so what does the recipe call for?
[1:57:42] <$Puhff> true
[1:57:50] <+fatal_penguin_> Baking is more Love, which I lack
[1:57:50] <Profmcstevie> Cooking requires judgement
[1:58:12] <%ClericOfSparda> awww
[1:58:13] <Ethrion> easy mode is now selectable
[1:58:15] <mike2hands> isn't all propuse flour bread flour?
[1:58:19] <%sumrand0> Low dose first I learned that from doing drugs, and going to college for the study of drugs!
[1:58:20] <%Jspeed8th> I believe the only difference is the gluten content which means it’ll be more stretchy like bread.
[1:58:21] <derap41> Time to make Custard
[1:58:23] <%Ashrox117> As long as you don’t use wheat flour you usually can get away with AP
[1:58:34] <+SWFanatic> c'est la vie

[2:29:10] <$rdark_ksu> honor is the best side dish for pasta

[2:33:17] <@PlagueOfGripes> paige has frozen food she won't eat because it's not for RICH people
[2:33:20] <@commanderclaw> You should try the trick where you invert the meatloaf onto a cookie sheet so that there's more surface area with glaze on it
[2:33:23] <$rdark_ksu> eat the non existing vegtables
[2:33:24] <StencilOST> Get a chair
[2:33:25] <%RedPanda25> speaking of Feetloaf my sister in laws pregnancy hippo feet are disgusting

[2:33:47] <+fatal_penguin_> @Weeabooninja yes she cooked clafoutis
[2:33:51] <derap41> Frozen food cost  way more money
[2:33:54] <%chosenjuan42> Paige's best recipe is how to make ham.  Step 1 take ham off ham sandwich
[2:33:57] <raineedaydreams> frozen food is way more expensive than fresh tho

[2:34:29] <+gregpivo> Poors buy seeds to grow their own food
[2:34:30] <@SoFarFetched> @Jjaz_R cause she's also in the US
[2:34:30] <%ClericOfSparda> Making food from scratch is hard when you work 8-10hr days, but it is healthier
[2:34:31] <+fatal_penguin_> frozen vegan food is expensive
[2:34:35] <%brokendarktower> dont eat frozen crap
[2:34:36] <@StridentSong> It depends on the area. Where I grew up getting a lot of fresh stuff was more expensive. Cause it was the fuck all nowhere in the mountains of California
[2:34:36] <Srthunda> I eat peanut and jelly sandwiches frozen, whats wrong with that
[2:34:39] <+Walopoh> spoiled rich people eat more trash than anybody

[2:34:45] <%chosenjuan42> shepherds pie is bomb
[2:34:45] <+necrocannibal2> frozen food is great if you don't want to go to the store every single day to get fresh stuff
[2:34:48] <lemon_lover28> your mom became poor? oh no
