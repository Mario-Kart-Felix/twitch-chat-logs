[0:20:07] <@SoFarFetched> @Futurecity10 Having the booster doesn't really mean "just don't give a shit whether or not you get COVID". They still want to be careful of getting it like everyone else.

[0:28:33] <Treasure_Vault> Come to america and pretend you're local. We'll give you a boosteer and ask NO QUESTIONS.
[0:28:34] <+TheMattman1313> A society
[0:28:34] <StebTheVee> You mean you're still not fully vaccinated?
[0:28:34] <%EyeFarted> PAT NEEDS A BOOSTER SEAT
[0:28:35] <SunsetJack> Wait, you can't do the January 4 appointement?
[0:28:35] <+RyTYoung> A society also
[0:28:36] <unfathomarble> yeah its horrible
[0:28:37] <%Th3SmartAlec> You got boost power!
[0:28:37] <SilverFaustX> im gettin mine in 10days, its from old to young here
[0:28:37] <ytwitchmeng> By then you will need a booster for the booster
[0:28:38] <%Sotetsu> The tundra.
[0:28:38] <%ChestMimik> I work with a medical office, and we literally cannot get enough Bossters to meet demand
[0:28:39] <+Reilata> I want to get my booster, but I feel sick already, so that's no good.
[0:28:39] <%nip_nips> The twins don't have boosters yet?
[0:28:39] <hearingthenseeing> Didn't we get fucked by China at first for the vaccines?
[0:28:41] <%KeiganOfAstora> January 17th is Betty White's birthday @PeachSaliva
[0:28:41] <+mmack093> I'm boosted and Omicron broke right through
[0:28:42] <Jerp> I'm eligible for the booster like, next week I think? at least in a week or two
[0:28:42] <+Scevda> I got mine before thanksgivng
[0:28:43] <%NoHoldsBarredProductions> Pfizer is crazy behind on availability for boosters. Almost all of the boosters in NS have to be Moderna.
[0:28:44] <+MisterAvry> you need Balto
[0:28:47] <$shurtal> Can they smell the menstruation?
[0:28:47] <%SuckerPunchSyd> I got my booster on the 23rd
[0:28:48] <graemecrackers2> 17th :'(
[0:28:49] <+Pengers> thats rough
[0:28:49] <%hewlettfan96> In a society
[0:28:50] <%TheWinged7> @peachsaliva yeah, Australia is running out of tests now because our pm refuses to do anything
[0:28:51] <worldbrand> yeah but even our polar bears got their boosters in ottawa
[0:28:52] <AMajorTom> Canada, man.
[0:28:53] <+michingmallecho> USA hoarding the boosters, I'm sorry 😔
[0:28:53] <+TDotGoat> do the polar bears take all the boosters?
[0:28:54] <ExpressNode> Got to get the booster pack
[0:28:54] <+buttdirt> Ontario is already doing 18 years old + for boosters
[0:28:54] <BedHome> yeah gotta vaccinatie the polarbears first
[0:28:57] <MookStyfawker> Boosters give you polar bears,
[0:29:01] <ytwitchmeng> Boosterken times 10
[0:29:02] <+Midashu> changes because COVID doesn't want to go away
[0:29:03] <StebTheVee> What's the difference?
[0:29:04] <+tempestzephyr> Cause the States are Hogging them
[0:29:04] <%janoonoo> Oh. We got ours in Manitoba.
[0:29:04] <SilverFaustX> janssen works better as a booster btw
[0:29:05] <%ospreyworks> booster was half as rough on me as the vaccines were, symptom wise
[0:29:06] <+Dova573> Thats wild all i had to do was go to my cvs where I work and got my booster
[0:29:06] <darylsleepshere> i just got my booster today!
[0:29:06] <%PocketBearIllustrator> got my booster yesterday and it kicked my ass when I went to bed
[0:29:08] <%ChrisPlaysThing> Don't worry, the 12th dose will make you immune
[0:29:09] <+anoldtoilet> :thinking:
[0:29:10] <%DianaTheAscian> I've got my booster just before demand started
[0:29:10] <%nip_nips> It's all age groups in the US.
[0:29:12] <+JoeSketchy> I was lucky enough to get my booster super early but it KO’d me for 2 days and it that time period, guess who got Covid with no symptoms? This guy!
[0:29:12] <derap41> Yeah its still 60+ here too
[0:29:14] <secret_npc> The lines for testing in Australia are like Wii Launch Bad
[0:29:17] <matsu_me> zangief will win
[0:29:18] <28moogles> I'm waiting to hear when I'm going to need a fourth shot at this point.
[0:29:19] <Treasure_Vault> Do you have passports? Come to america and LIE. The nurses encourage you to LIE and get the booster.
[0:29:20] <%Sotetsu> Pat, you need to snuggle a booster out.

[0:29:57] <hearingthenseeing> just let her be 100

[0:29:58] <+PrimalDweeb> Rest In Power Betty!
[0:29:58] <bundle_of_herbs> man am i glad i got my booster even if i had to queue for 2.5 hours
[0:29:59] <vehementvadr> it's all downhill from here
[0:29:59] <derap41> Now all we have is the Queen of England
[0:29:59] <$FrostedZaibatsu> She lived a long life. I cant be sad, but happy i can do the same
[0:30:00] <%hewlettfan96> 99 damn I didn’t think she could die
[0:30:00] <hearingthenseeing> let's all pretend
[0:30:01] <mikesapartment> i feel like the universe said "no"
[0:30:01] <Latija> she was immortal
[0:30:02] <mike2hands> Maan……

[0:30:02] <+VivaLetina> it started with alan rickman in 2015
[0:30:02] <secret_npc> 99 tho
[0:30:02] <%ospreyworks> eh, it would have sucked no matter when she died
[0:30:04] <MookStyfawker> Pour one out for the actual Queen.
[0:30:04] <+RandyFistburgers> THE END TIMES ARE NIGH
[0:30:06] <remainprofane> Rip
[0:30:07] <%KeiganOfAstora> She was only like, 60 years old too
[0:30:07] <+Reilata> Betty White went on to New Game +
[0:30:08] <AMajorTom> Betty: Apres moi, le deluge
[0:30:08] <+Scevda> Im surprised she got through 2020.
[0:30:12] <+Birdigalore> 2022 is fucked!
[0:30:13] <@Jekado> 2022 already foreboding...
[0:30:13] <BigYanno> I'm pissed that The Queen outlived her (probably anyway, nobody's seen her recently)
[0:30:14] <graemecrackers2> it is sad
[0:30:14] <$Trenr> betty white passed away on new years eve? isn't that one of the last seals that needs to be broken before the apocalypse?
[0:30:14] <+Mendin> @TheWinged7 hate to break it to you but she went a week or two ago
[0:30:15] <+TheUltrahumanoid> 2021 had to get that last jab in
[0:30:16] <Dr_Mooose> just never thought it would actually happen
[0:30:17] <waltzqueen> @CaptainPileDriver shes already dead. its just a deep fake that she is alive
[0:30:17] <$jake5713> The woman was a CHAMPION. FortOne BibleThump
[0:30:17] <%ospreyworks> it would have been worse if she'd died on the first day of 2022
[0:30:17] <Bl4kDynamite> Yup end of the world is right around the corner
[0:30:18] <CaptainBright> Or Betty White is one of the Queen's final gambit for her NEW PHASE
[0:30:18] <%Sotetsu> The last shitty thing to happen in 2021.
[0:30:19] <%Bt_Robot> She was the best of us
[0:30:20] <+sashagreenspiderqueen> @PrimalDweeb i get you want to be respectful but rest in power is for queer and black people, thats not for her
[0:30:20] <+RyTYoung> Just today I saw an article about Ryan Reynolds talking about her, then hours later she passed away
[0:30:23] <%hewlettfan96> Eeeeeee
[0:30:24] <+balouie> at least dolly parton is still around
[0:30:25] <Treasure_Vault> Now to elect a new sparkling gem... and it's Chris Pratt!
[0:30:25] <%ChestMimik> Bring out the Ouija board for her birthday. She's still invited!
[0:30:25] <%Catpurnicus> sorry, the us took all the boosters and gave them to antivaxx states that tossed them in the trash
[0:30:25] <+Kindan55> better the last day than the first
[0:30:27] <%PocketBearIllustrator> but then again, death comes for us all in the end
[0:30:27] <%ElkRiverDog> I mean, if you count leap years she made it to 100
[0:30:28] <+rheviel> 99 is a hell of a run though
[0:30:32] <%NoHoldsBarredProductions> She got to level 99 and said "aight imma head out"
[0:30:32] <%TheWinged7> well at least she never aged out of being able to play with Lego
[0:30:35] <secret_npc> I think reached the end of her wick instead of snuffing out
[0:30:36] <%hewlettfan96> Damn that is a bad omen
[0:30:36] <rosemon5001> last of the gilden has perished the curses will run wild now
[0:30:37] <%ospreyworks> yeah, she lived a hell of a life
[0:30:37] <AMajorTom> She was the last seal holding back the apocolypse

[1:23:17] <+Jhylla81> My nephew is 5 and he's the most hyper kid ive ever met. loving but hyper
[1:23:21] <@SoFarFetched> its like NOTHING but dark souls
[1:23:30] <@SoFarFetched> we say as you're doing Demons Souls
[1:23:31] <@SoFarFetched> Kappa
[1:23:31] <%Sotetsu> Good thing you're taking a break with Demon Souls and Elden Ring
[1:23:32] <worldbrand> oh hey that's fair
[1:23:33] <Jaysky> How bout that Ace Attorney
[1:23:34] <jetpack_rorschasch> It helps the semen to stay put inside you. Kappa
[1:23:35] <%g0atmeal> i dropped a challenge run at demon prince and came back years later. i really know the feeling
[1:23:39] <%aishman> Wait even Sekiro?!
[1:23:40] <FalseKingAki> sekiro?
[1:23:43] <+coward_man> DS3 DLC will be banged out over A summer, which summer? Who knows?
[1:23:47] <TurtlesAndTentacles> your earliest tweets were about pats penis lol
[1:23:47] <%ospreyworks> have you played sekiro?
[1:23:47] <BigYanno> SekiSoulsBorne Ring
[1:23:51] <Coystick> Sekiro doesn't count
[1:23:52] <Dunmarkh> We're gonna bang out demon's souls over new years
[1:23:57] <@SoFarFetched> @Jaysky she can't really do it because it destroys hers and pats voice doing all the lines.
[1:23:57] <%CaptainPileDriver> it's also one of if not the hardest dlc in the souls series
[1:24:00] <%RayReborne> Sekiro would be.......... interesting to see Paige attempt
[1:24:00] <brachydios777> Isn’t DS2 dlc hard as shit?
[1:24:01] <graemecrackers2> get those finger prints on all the shiny armor
[1:24:01] <derap41> but the DLC is the best part
[1:24:02] <digaogrunge> Elden Ring... 2022 can't be all bad
[1:24:02] <bob900000> is paige going to play sekiro?
[1:24:06] <+Mekhet09> You should try out psychonauts.
[1:24:07] <+CrimKangaroo> NO! No sekiro for Peach. It would bust her body more than it already is
[1:24:10] <Ell1ot> i've only played the first one
[1:24:20] <%legendfather_of_giants> ever going to try out it takes two?
[1:24:22] <%maenos2> man sekiro would break her wrists
[1:24:23] <secret_npc> is Village the first vore/mold game? hehehe
[1:24:23] <+JustToWatch> Sekiro would be the end of Paige
[1:24:23] <yukichocomilk> you can do it!
[1:24:24] <henshin2289> Yeah like why be in a rush for it to be all over?
[1:24:26] <%Sotetsu> Sekiro isn't a souls game
[1:24:30] <%AncelDeLambert> I certainly wasn't
[1:24:32] <T_Sasquatch> your wrists would break
[1:24:32] <TheZearGuy> It’s kind of meh to be honest
[1:24:33] <scrumbotime> Sekiro wants you to have reflexes and also you CANNOT face fuck
[1:24:34] <$SvenHolgersson> Sekiro is one of the harder ones
[1:24:35] <signofzeta> it's true, sekiro is intense
[1:24:36] <%g0atmeal> less about reflexes and more about timing imo, but physically taxing
[1:24:36] <Jaysky> @SoFarFetched Makes sense. It's not quite a stream game unlike AI Somnium
[1:24:38] <+Axellogic> Sekiro is much meaner
[1:24:39] <%StephanieSadGirl> If you want a puzzle game that is cute and no where near as hard as baba, I'd reccomend Sunshine Heavy Industries.  Its utterly adorable.
[1:24:40] <Prevot> can't just face fuck sekiro
[1:24:43] <+hiswill98> Sekiro is my favorite Souls game!
[1:24:43] <%AncelDeLambert> I never would have bought Sekiro if I didn't have an INSANE fever the week of release
[1:24:44] <%SuckerPunchSyd> Hands hurty
[1:24:47] <watts121> A TEST OF YOUR REFLEXES!
[1:24:48] <+CrimKangaroo> hey, i'm busted
[1:24:53] <%superc37> she is absolutely incapable of beating sekiro
[1:24:56] <brachydios777> Sekiro is all dex
[1:24:59] <Admiral_PopnFresh> that you are a zombie?
[1:25:00] <+realm_forge> Sekrio is the Kira of Souls games
[1:25:01] <Pappajimbo> worse than a stadia
[1:25:03] <T_Sasquatch> A TEST OF YOUR REFLEXES
[1:25:05] <%AncelDeLambert> Sekiro is pure pain
[1:25:08] <Sunstalker> scrumbotime You absolutely can facefuck a lot in sekiro
[1:25:08] <trackles_64> so no apex?
[1:25:12] <+coward_man> that explains SO MUCH
[1:25:12] <TallYoda08> Sekiro is sooo sick tho atpFeelsBeardMan
[1:25:21] <worldbrand> im from the future and Elden Ring is great, i'm stuck in the marsh though and i have no idea what to do about fiona
[1:25:27] <%RayReborne> GOOD VIBES

[1:25:32] <%StephanieSadGirl> F

[1:25:39] <+YPFrost> hi
[1:25:40] <@SoFarFetched> @mastermindgoblin not start yet
[1:25:43] <+Ches_Neckbeard> Both or Bolth?
[1:25:45] <+HuoShengdi> Sekiro demands the same dexterity a rhythm game would
[1:25:49] <+CrimKangaroo> Instead of >Sekiro, play Ghost of Tsushima. they are nothing alike, but it's a gorgeous game
[1:25:50] <trackles_64> i always pleasure myself
[1:25:51] <%Sotetsu> I just want to do pleasurable stuff. :(

[1:26:15] <%ChrisPlaysThing> LUL
[1:26:19] <TheFrontRowJoe> @huoshengdi exactly, if you're going purely deflect gameplay, sekiro is pretty much a rhythm game
[1:26:22] <+realm_forge> Do a big sex. Like the BIGGEST sex
[1:26:24] <$Chatterbox1991> i go on walk; can confirm it helps

[1:26:40] <@SoFarFetched> shit you fryin' chicken in there? That's pretty cool
[1:26:43] <%CaptainPileDriver> paige stop making people do things that you're in too

[1:26:51] <%legendfather_of_giants> don't think it don't say it

[1:45:34] <VritraReiRei> remember, you can build your character with ANY STAT. just because you start with stats, doesnt mean you are stuck with it
[1:45:34] <Laioken13> paige no listen good
[1:45:35] <@SoFarFetched> Paige just wants royalty cause she wants a crown
[1:45:36] <%mastermindgoblin> royalty works better for going magic/dex, TK goes strength/faith

[1:46:05] <%SophiaAmoreaVeritas> You are not locked in.
[1:46:06] <kazadog> @Manwad from a minmaxing perspective no because it has some high points in stats that most builds dont care about
[1:46:06] <Oscarthemowerman> temple knight has 14 STR and Barbarian has 15 STR not much of a difference
[1:46:11] <%SuckerPunchSyd> Pretty
[1:46:12] <zzNamttamzz> Never going to use the wand rooW

[1:46:41] <jetpack_rorschasch> Ring

[1:52:50] <%mastermindgoblin> You could always do the youtube method: set every single slider to one extreme or the other.
[1:52:52] <%GoogleyGareth> Or facial animations
[1:52:53] <Clundy> Time to spend an hour making Paige as a character

[1:53:20] <%JenovasPuppet> Take as much time as you want. I would be dying from anxiety, given this much choice.
[1:53:22] <digaogrunge> This is the good part, the game will be pain
[1:53:24] <+realm_forge> Spend all the time on this. This is gold
[1:53:24] <%Catpurnicus> the original one looked the best

[1:57:25] <%ChrisPlaysThing> I wish games would jut not do hair outside of cutscenes
[1:57:25] <brachydios777> Isn’t that nose crooked?
[1:57:29] <+MetroidSlayerP7> @frolomeo put a character creator in the game, and that becomes the entire game

[2:04:15] <Huntercd> Nioh 2 has a good cc
[2:04:22] <+FadingEmber> @ToastyBroDude honestly they will just get an attitude if they catch asking. Might make us wait another 2 hours
[2:04:31] <brachydios777> @catastrophecorvid Video games in general
[2:04:35] <%Sotetsu> It's only 8pm and I'm already sleepy...
[2:04:35] <ToastyBroDude> I don't watch Paige or Pat very often, so last time I checked usually it's like 40 mins max lol
[2:04:39] <someyounguy1> is the theme song a lil distorted for anyone else?
[2:04:40] <%KeiganOfAstora> @FadingEmber Which honestly is a bit childish of them but whatever it's their stream
[2:04:44] <@SoFarFetched> @mastermindgoblin I THINK there was a time she only played for like maybe hour or so but that was either because she wasn't feeling good or the internet was bad
[2:04:55] <EynoStiles> @theanora1 Pat doesnt have to do anything. Watch hits randomize turning the stream back on. lol
[2:04:59] <%mastermindgoblin> lol, that's fair.
[2:05:07] <%KeiganOfAstora> I remember recently she said she'd try to keep the intro to just an hour or so and do the rest after
[2:05:29] <@SoFarFetched> @someyounguy1 try a refresh
[2:05:35] <+FadingEmber> @KeiganOfAstora ...I mean childish is kinda their MO, so I am not surprised.
[2:05:37] <+patriotrenegade> Did she start the game yet
[2:05:41] <%mastermindgoblin> Honestly, it's really no big deal, but it is VERY FUNNY that they decided to take a break right as they were ready to start
[2:05:52] <GarbageQueenEllie> Fuck you, it's new years! Who's getting sloshed?
[2:05:53] <+anoldtoilet> its awesome

[2:07:15] <%TheWinged7> @peachsaliva  is Pat i still getting nto his baby new years costume?
[2:07:18] <+FadingEmber> @SoFarFetched Dude why are you even responding to me. I wasn't the one complaining.
[2:07:19] <ferretking131> hurrah for hydration!
[2:07:19] <brachydios777> I thought that was vodka for a sec
[2:07:21] <BigYanno> What's a gallon in nomal people numbers
[2:07:21] <MarsKarl> wtf that's so much water, that's like a bathroom trip every hour
[2:07:28] <+Taisuru> Did pat died?
[2:07:34] <SilverFaustX> thats too much
[2:07:34] <AMajorTom> at least 6 oz water per drink
[2:07:34] <Treasure_Vault> that's hot
[2:07:36] <+HRDSalami654> Don't do it too quickly.
[2:07:37] <%mastermindgoblin> Pat got thanos snapped
[2:07:38] <%CatastropheCorvid> @BigYanno 4 kitres or so
[2:07:38] <DXLelouch24> Why no long hair? You telling me this looks this good but they couldnt add a long hair option?
[2:07:43] <%Mr_y1096> rip in piss
[2:07:48] <jetpack_rorschasch> Yes, he died.
[2:07:48] <@SoFarFetched> @FadingEmber relax I mean if they wanna act how they want,they can LUL
[2:07:54] <+warlockwithapixie> Does Pat is dead?
[2:07:56] <+ReallyBigRocks> physics is hard
[2:07:56] <+VentWilsn> pat's cubeforming
[2:07:58] <%g0atmeal> hard to program
[2:07:58] <+CrimKangaroo> if you're drinking that much, be careful of hyponatremia
[2:08:00] <+Nekros4442> to be fair, long hair is a nightmare
[2:08:05] <brachydios777> Even monster hunter has long hair
[2:08:07] <cache_22> Long hair would clip through so much armor, plus helmets.
[2:08:12] <+captain_thickthighs> long hair is a pain to rig
[2:08:16] <captwolfaroo> Gotta jam that 'do in a helmet
[2:08:17] <Dunmarkh> yeah but it's fuckin cool though
[2:08:19] <%RayReborne> not to gice Pat the Mind Gnomes but Nioh 2 has one of the best character creators ive ever seen
[2:08:19] <%Sotetsu> Awww
[2:08:20] <TheZearGuy> Pony tails the same as capes. Both killers
[2:08:22] <%mastermindgoblin> CHEEESE
[2:08:22] <+ALazo> long hair means figuring out hair physics or living with horrible clipping
[2:08:22] <MidnightPacif1c> psaBougie choese
[2:08:23] <%g0atmeal> souls games have "shaved" versions of hair for when you put on a helmet
[2:08:26] <%bettysharkface> Secret cheese!
[2:08:30] <trackles_64> mary that man
[2:08:30] <%TheLemuroid> Top knots are optimal
[2:08:30] <+HRDSalami654> If you drink too quickly the water will just pass through your body with no benefit.
[2:08:31] <+Romuken> But...  But you only wanna eat the meat!
[2:08:31] <blue8moon> cheese and blueberry jam?
[2:08:32] <AMajorTom> Pat on the spot with that choes
[2:08:32] <GarbageQueenEllie> That shade of green goes great w Digi-Paige
[2:08:35] <%superc37> NIOH 2 HAS LONG HAIR THO
[2:08:37] <%JobbedBone> just throw AI at the hair physics and pre-bake most of it Kappa
[2:08:38] <%Sotetsu> What kind of cheese is that?
[2:08:39] <Huntercd> There is a great Canadian that sells diapers for Pat's costume
[2:08:41] <%superc37> and it looks good
[2:08:41] <OverzealousEuthanasiast> anime tho
[2:08:41] <Hydrapissed> she still making char?
[2:08:42] <secret_npc> There are a criminally low amount of long hair and dress options for RPGs
[2:08:44] <+SenorCounter> Eat them in a stack to fuck with him
[2:08:50] <Prevot> SMT V hears the excuses against long hair and says "lol, lmao"
[2:08:50] <%ChestMimik> "Did you not notice" "No" is the usual with Paige and food huh?
[2:08:51] <%mastermindgoblin> Pat such a sweetie
[2:08:54] <scrumbotime> well that explains your cat, dog, and pat
[2:09:02] <AMajorTom> My name is Prince, I like them stinky
[2:09:04] <chimeraxmachina> remember when that Alice: Madness returns game game out and everyone waslike "uuuhh long hair that isn't in a ponytail"
[2:09:05] <+FadingEmber> @SoFarFetched ...I never said they couldn't, but this point it just feel like you're wait to flex your mod.
[2:09:22] <@SoFarFetched> @FadingEmber nooo I think you're just weirdly freaking out on me just responding geefAwk

[2:09:37] <@SoFarFetched> There's nothing for me to flex.

[2:21:39] <+ReallyBigRocks> close enough
[2:21:40] <%SophiaAmoreaVeritas> You had the right idea.

[2:21:56] <Valkryna> wait Paige is playing a magic character?
[2:21:57] <brachydios777> I’d love it if there was a message that said”remember, switching to your pistol is faster than reloading”
[2:22:03] <%StephanieSadGirl> The 'boom' happens right before the 'shakalaka'
[2:22:04] <%Th3SmartAlec> @neonbleu LULQ
[2:22:06] <$SvenHolgersson> PAIGE YOU PLAYED DARK SOULS SILLY BILLY

[2:22:26] <marvel877> Its all a ruse, Paige is sober as a bird.
[2:22:27] <+Undenizen> that was a timed message to make it LOOK authentic.
[2:22:27] <hoagie_in_disguise> Paige: Beats Bloodborne.  Also Paige: How do I parry with the parry message on the screen.
[2:22:28] <%walternatorz> Paige is extremely competent at all video games.
[2:22:28] <VritraReiRei> Paige is just drunk is all Kappa
[2:22:29] <%Catpurnicus> you'd think chat would be happy that they get to see paige play her first souls game 5 times in a row
[2:22:31] <%g0atmeal> tbf we're relearning the controls after beating 4 of the games in the franchise
[2:22:32] <%VashyronM> She did kill the hardest boss in Bloodborne in 10 seconds

[2:22:36] <%superc37> god i wish this was a bit
[2:22:38] <%Ranryu692> How could this be scripted if Paige can't read?
[2:22:39] <%KeiganOfAstora> The video games isn't the bit, it's the blind
[2:22:41] <+FadingEmber> except the bonfires and the magic
[2:22:41] <%CappuccinoGuil> DELETED
[2:22:42] <+tempestzephyr> next bit

[2:23:37] <SivSarcast> Well, he's less threatening than a Black Knight.
[2:23:37] <%g0atmeal> @GarbageQueenEllie that would be an amazing fighting game super. the character just stops pretending to be bad for 5 seconds
[2:23:54] <%RayReborne> Start Blastinf with Gun Stick Kappa
[2:24:03] <AMajorTom> BAM
[2:24:07] <RetroCop87> Everyone remember to keep an eye out for the Souls fandom in chat. They'll be the ones complaining non-stop about optimal playstyles

[2:24:19] <%walternatorz> Do we take a drink every time Paige beats an enemy?
[2:24:19] <%Catpurnicus> I need to play this game again, it looks so good
[2:24:21] <%ChestMimik> @g0atmeal Pretending to be bad > holding back your full power
[2:24:23] <%MarsKarl> @RetroCop87 correct, they literally cannot help themselves

[2:25:08] <%Th3SmartAlec> raise your shield!
[2:25:15] <$SvenHolgersson> SHIELDS ARE FOR THE WEAK
[2:25:17] <trackles_64> Pat

[2:30:44] <%JobbedBone> that scene where casper describes what it feels like to die *messed* me up as a child
[2:30:46] <%MarsKarl> @CappuccinoGuil I think goth requires a willing decision to appear goth, and I remain unconvinced she is choosing much of anything
[2:30:46] <%g0atmeal> good hunter...
[2:30:49] <DXLelouch24> dunno but Melina is obviously the badass scar waifu

[2:41:29] <+Mekhet09> I never understood why people had a hard time with this.
[2:41:30] <+patriotrenegade> fuck this guy
[2:41:30] <scrumbotime> I had a STRUGGLE with the boss, because I went Barbarian and clubs are USELESS against it. I had to mid fight swap to a new sword and buff it
[2:41:30] <+Undenizen> he's doing a vore.
[2:41:31] <%RayReborne> no offense obviously
[2:41:33] <lotharrio> Ghosts vs demons!
[2:41:35] <primaryfire> hungy :)
[2:41:37] <%g0atmeal> @RayReborne fair enough, the skellies would be really distracting with their allure lol
[2:41:39] <%Th3SmartAlec> Get his ass Zangief!

[2:42:12] <+Undenizen> @pectusumbra large, veiny, and certainly up to no good.
[2:42:14] <OvaltineDream> He HATES it
[2:42:15] <studleydoorite> did Paige just look up into the sky to motion to the top of her screen
[2:42:17] <ferretking131> i think your lamp is haunted
[2:42:20] <%ChrisPlaysThing> Lamp is haunted
[2:42:25] <+diathex> Anyone else still not have a ps5 because of bs?
[2:42:26] <%ChrisPlaysThing> By Abe
[2:42:30] <%NigelSchnauzerpug> The light blinds him! He requires darkness!
[2:42:37] <+ReallyBigRocks> just kill Paige
[2:42:38] <Chaos_Aether> Alright get your scraping spears ready invader
[2:42:43] <%FacetiousAF> be huge do murders
[2:42:48] <+Mekhet09> @diathex I just got a ps5 because of 3 months of being in the sony direct queue.
[2:42:49] <%Keyd00d> They lumbering
[2:42:51] <%Th3SmartAlec> G U N
[2:42:54] <%ChestMimik> So anyways I started blastin
[2:42:56] <%superc37> you cant invade ghosts tho
[2:42:57] <%Ranryu692> the spells sound so wet
[2:42:59] <+forebringer> The gun kills the mans
[2:43:04] <+Undenizen> it LOOKS like it feels good
[2:43:07] <+AnthonyJMax> it does feel good
[2:43:08] <%Th3SmartAlec> Playstation 5? What the fuck is that?
[2:43:14] <ExpressNode> Felt surprisingly good. On the PS3 though....
[2:43:17] <worldbrand> the vibration sounds like it's a gimmick but it's really neat
[2:43:17] <%MarsKarl> dude like every other souls game has at least one exact sequence like this area
[2:43:21] <$SvenHolgersson> I played a Royal on my first time through and it was AMAZING
[2:43:24] <%Catpurnicus> zap zap
[2:43:27] <%legendfather_of_giants> until you get the mp regen sword
[2:43:27] <%Keyd00d> You can really feel the screams of the damned
[2:43:28] <+Mekhet09> It does but spells aren't very versatile in demon souls.
[2:43:31] <Latija> like a red mage
[2:43:31] <%MarsKarl> you'd figure they wouldn't callback to this so constantly
[2:43:37] <%ChrisPlaysThing> Big rumbly i nthe bumbly
[2:43:42] <Cosairen> KILL
[2:43:43] <tanarath> bork bork
[2:43:53] <SivSarcast> There's that classic flail attack.
[2:43:55] <+KevinsLunchbox> poke stabs are so good
[2:43:55] <+diathex> @Mekhet09 I should try that, i've been trying store apps on my phone for a year. and they always break (the apps) when the sales go live.
[2:43:58] <ExpressNode> I hate the dualshock 3. Glad Sony somewhat shifted away from it
[2:44:00] <+Mekhet09> I went all magic no weapons on my build and it was viable to a point.
[2:44:04] <ferretking131> get that grass!
[2:44:08] <hoagie_in_disguise> Paige has a gun but she'd rather feel the blood on her hands after dealing with them up close and personal.
[2:44:08] <%Keyd00d> nice roll
[2:44:12] <+ReallyBigRocks> big killin goin on
[2:44:17] <GarbageQueenEllie> yeyeye geeetum

[2:44:35] <ferretking131> YO NICE
[2:44:37] <%ChrisPlaysThing> Yoshi's Island Theme?!
[2:44:37] <Frolomeo> did they fix dexterity in this game?
[2:44:41] <%Agami23> i wish you got extra damage when your sword happens to hit them in the head
[2:44:45] <+MetroidSlayerP7> Zardoz "the gun is good" but for Des magic
[2:44:49] <%ocelotshotfirst> Says the woman who just got fire.
[2:44:52] <GarbageQueenEllie> It feels good to penetrate the enemies by thrusting your weapon at them
[2:44:58] <+ReallyBigRocks> just blast em
[2:45:10] <+Seancicle> soon gotta jet
[2:45:11] <+HRDSalami654> Reggie 2.0. lol

[2:46:27] <+TheUltrahumanoid> Oh shiny
[2:46:28] <+twohitgood> it's shiny looking because it's a bunch of souls because it's a pit for mass execution.

[2:46:32] <%CappuccinoGuil> GLASSES, PAIGE
[2:46:32] <%ChestMimik> blind
[2:46:33] <Jerp> for me I was like "oh I could pick up something here right?", in my first playthrough

[2:46:42] <worldbrand> Oh I definitely thought it looked like... something
[2:46:44] <DXLelouch24> @PeachSaliva Reggie didnt fall into that hole btw, so guess Reggies better at Souls than Paige
[2:46:44] <+Mekhet09> How are you even playing. if you're that blind.
[2:46:44] <ferretking131> That was not in fact what it looked like
[2:46:46] <brachydios777> you guys hear about how demon souls has the lancer from gears in its files?
[2:46:46] <GarbageQueenEllie> Walk on the waaaater
[2:46:47] <+MisterAvry> thank you Paige I needed that laugh
[2:46:50] <+bluedude153> PLEASE JUST BUY GLASSES HOW HAS IT BEEN YEARS OF THIS
[2:46:53] <+Undenizen> Hasn't the "paige needs glasses" saga been going on for like... years?
[2:46:55] <+ReallyBigRocks> it's definitely a big hole, it just looks friendly
[2:47:05] <+captain_thickthighs> we should make Reggie and Paige play against each other in a game let's see who's is better
[2:47:05] <tanarath> Paige, please, PLEASE, P L E A S E get glasses.
[2:47:10] <@SoFarFetched> @bluedude153 the funny  thing is she has.....they just keep breaking geefPlz
[2:47:13] <%legendfather_of_giants> 3 years
[2:47:14] <@SoFarFetched> or being lost
[2:47:15] <Cosairen> somerimes
[2:47:24] <TheeRabbi> Paige is like me when I was 13--rather be blind and stumble through life missing all the details than wear glasses.
[2:47:27] <%vivaldiva> sipsipSipsipblind
[2:47:30] <ferretking131> HUGE
[2:47:33] <yousomuch_> lmao she bought glasses tho and broke like 10 pairs right?
[2:47:41] <%JenovasPuppet> Oh that was bullshit!
[2:47:42] <OvaltineDream> Big and strong
[2:47:43] <@SoFarFetched> yeah it was either 10 or 12 pairs she lost/broke
[2:47:44] <%FacetiousAF> pag as whiff now is when hub sand makes your appointments.
[2:48:05] <ferretking131> well get
[2:48:11] <+PrimalDweeb> The sounds of the game are pretty noice.
[2:48:15] <%MarsKarl> @FacetiousAF finally, somebody had to say it (whatever that is)
[2:48:15] <+Mekhet09> You should switch to weaker grass.
[2:48:19] <+RemedyofRevenge> Is this a Pat vs back seat mind goblin? Or just casual playthrough

[2:50:31] <TheeRabbi> Yeah but Elden Ring won't half the stupid health bar mechanic
[2:50:31] <%Keyd00d> I feel like DeS won't be much of a problem for her. Good thing I don't have Crazy Talk
[2:50:42] <SivSarcast> The eastern blades have nice ripostes.
[2:50:49] <Treasure_Vault> haha, a hole
[2:50:52] <+kurejichi> that is NOT true lmao, timing is not the same
[2:50:52] <+ReallyBigRocks> not their fault you didn't read it
[2:50:53] <ferretking131> beware of water
[2:51:05] <+patriotrenegade> Eat that grass, you cow

[2:52:17] <%superc37> also ngl i also found it kinda weord how they put in the effort to give every weapon a unique 2-handed riposte animation but no way to parry when 2 handing
[2:52:17] <%Keyd00d> Get that spatial awareness
[2:52:18] <%crazyspartan214> clip it
[2:52:18] <+warlockwithapixie> This death, I like it, ANOTHER!

[2:52:24] <%RayReborne> its the New Years Pit Kappa
[2:52:25] <KellBeII> that hole has claimed many souls, yours wont be the last
[2:52:26] <+patriotrenegade> Gravity 2, Paige 0
[2:52:28] <SivSarcast> The second greatest ambush is the skeleton kick ambush trap in Dark Souls 1's Tomb of the Giants.
[2:52:35] <$Afterman_> has pat been informed of square enix's president's love for nfts?
[2:52:48] <silentshrug> No scream? Then why are we here?
[2:52:50] <%spongeofmystery> Dammit, I missed something good didn't I?
[2:52:54] <%QueequegTheater> UNH AHH UGGH

[2:53:22] <Parapattern> @spongeofmystery She fell down the sparkly hole not once, but twice
[2:53:27] <+ikantreeed> I Just started DS2 and already understand why ppl say it's the least good LUL
[2:53:28] <$SvenHolgersson> You can go super far with the stuff they give you at the beginning
[2:53:28] <$Afterman_> @superc37 nope. it was just recently made public, dm me and i can link u
[2:53:38] <%aishman> It's like the opposite problem I had with Dark Souls
[2:53:38] <CunnymobileBrakeFluid> I wish the enemies still sounded like in the original, I miss their old man screams tdogSad
[2:53:39] <ChungusQuest> still on the half moon grass
[2:54:03] <SivSarcast> I think a really good parrying tip came in when Pat and Woolie played DS1. "Don't watch their weapon, watch the hand"
[2:54:13] <%Keyd00d> Great!
[2:54:13] <%spongeofmystery> @Undenizen sipsipSipsipblind
[2:54:16] <morcego_cinzento_arts> time for Paige Soul. drink up your mustard estus

[2:56:33] <AMajorTom> The rain in Spain stays maily in the plain
[2:56:36] <ferretking131> paige should play through portal again
[2:56:38] <captwolfaroo> Then comes the deadly guessing game of which enemies can be parried
[2:56:40] <$Afterman_> @SilverFaustX i was just talking about that in chat lol
[2:56:48] <+Undenizen> i like how much they freak out
[2:57:07] <%RayReborne> shes LEARNING heck yeah
[2:57:08] <+FingaLights> Did Paige do Portal 2? i forget
[2:57:09] <tigerfang86> parry FRENZY
[2:57:09] <%sleepystardewfarmer> Every single time you pick up an item, the sound sounds exactly like the first bell of my alarm clock
[2:57:13] <Smaenus> addicted to PARRY
[2:57:19] <%Insom62> damn shes killin it
[2:57:20] <tanarath> This zone is turbo-fucked
[2:57:23] <NeroInfinite> the parry fever
[2:57:29] <+ikantreeed> Parrying is a gateway drug, next thing she'll be smoking CRACK!!!!!!
[2:57:35] <%mastermindgoblin> So what's the over under on Paige reaching Phalanx this year? Methinks not
[2:57:42] <@SoFarFetched> @FingaLights yeah she did Portal 2
[2:57:45] <+Undenizen> hey paige, dodge left in this area.
[2:57:47] <SivSarcast> @ikantreeed Spell parry next?
[2:57:49] <+MetroidSlayerP7> Parry the hole
[2:57:49] <$Afterman_> @mastermindgoblin 2021 or 2022?

[2:58:16] <%rumtumtugnutz> This year ends in a minute
[2:58:19] <%JenovasPuppet> Look at that water!
[2:58:21] <$Afterman_> @mastermindgoblin  shes actually gonna make negative progress Kappa just for you
[2:58:22] <Parapattern> Nemesis
[2:58:24] <+kimo313> 4 hours left
[2:58:26] <%AncelDeLambert> I've been cyberpunking. Why is Paige anything other than unga-bunga?
[2:58:33] <Srthunda> this year ends in 4 hours
[2:58:36] <%mastermindgoblin> @Afterman_ Awww, gonna make me blush
[2:58:38] <+Undenizen> I'm in 2022, so unless something goes REALLY wrong, i think she's got a shot.
[2:58:40] <+Mekhet09> I wouldn't worry about parrying unless it's useful.
[2:58:42] <LeeOhX> Is Peach gonna beat the game for the ball drops?! You better believe it
[2:58:43] <brachydios777> Paige and pat is est btw
[2:58:46] <ferretking131> damn he was waiting for it
[2:58:49] <+ReallyBigRocks> chat is currently discovering the concept of time zones
[2:58:49] <Cosairen> @AncelDeLambert GUN
[2:58:54] <linSP> god i cant get over how good this game looks
[2:58:55] <SivSarcast> It's like 12pm in 2022 here. No hover cars yet.
[2:58:56] <%JenovasPuppet> Roll back in three two...
[2:58:58] <captwolfaroo> Got an hour left of 2021, here
[2:59:00] <%rumtumtugnutz> Or no wait. In EST this year ends in an hour. Durr.
[2:59:02] <+extradopeness> well we got ONE HOUR to find out
[2:59:05] <KellBeII> she backed up into the exact saame position that time
[2:59:06] <Hydrapissed> SourPls SourPls SourPls
[2:59:07] <%mastermindgoblin> like, chat, I live in the same timezone as they do, not all of you do lmao
[2:59:08] <Smaenus> parry too satisfying LUL
[2:59:16] <SilverFaustX> this just in twitter still a shithole in 2022
[2:59:18] <Jerp> I like the parry too
[2:59:20] <%AncelDeLambert> you can do it, Paige, just reconnect to the cavewoman inside you
[2:59:22] <+MetroidSlayerP7> parry the darkness
[2:59:22] <Profmcstevie> You want hovercar accidents? People can't drive when gravity is involved
[2:59:37] <dashmatt> HAPPY NEW YEAR FROM NOVA SCOTIA🎉🎉🎉
[2:59:39] <%QueequegTheater> If we were in the hovercar timeline Betty White would be alive
[2:59:41] <%Agami23> this game is neat because all the parrys and backstabs have unique animations and stuff. also all the kicks are different
[2:59:42] <%g0atmeal> remember in 2015 when everyone talked about back to the future II? that was 7 years ago
[2:59:43] <SivSarcast> @Profmcstevie I want the "Woolie fighting on top of hovercars" thing.
[2:59:45] <brachydios777> Funfact: hovercars are actually a terrible idea
[2:59:47] <linSP> parry and punching tho
[2:59:48] <$Afterman_> yea no regular person needs a fucking hovercar. people are beyond moronas
[2:59:57] <%mastermindgoblin> I don't trust people with normal cars, and you wanna let them FLY?! YOU MADLADS!
[3:00:01] <MicrotonalMatt> No hover cars, only nfts in square enix games tdogGrungle
[3:00:01] <tanarath> Let the Unga flow through you, Paige
[3:00:04] <%AncelDeLambert> pffft
[3:00:05] <%Keyd00d> bwong
[3:00:08] <%AncelDeLambert> EEEEEEEEL KABONG!
[3:00:16] <%Keyd00d> lmao
[3:00:20] <Hydrapissed> FeelsAmazingMan
[3:00:20] <islandsunn> lol
[3:00:20] <+FingaLights> LUL
[3:00:23] <%JenovasPuppet> We must find Paige the shield with the fastest parry speed
[3:00:24] <@SoFarFetched> @mastermindgoblin I mean not everyone knows everyones timezones in here LUL we just guess
[3:00:28] <+Undenizen> Fun fact: In Lord Of The Rings, Ian McElain was directed to scream when he was stabbed. He refused, citing that people don't scream when they're stabbed in the back. He knows because he's stabbed people.
[3:00:30] <%VashyronM> magic pixel
[3:00:31] <%Insom62> just swat the bombs away
[3:00:31] <SivSarcast> Magic pixel let's go!
[3:00:31] <%legendfather_of_giants> nailed it
[3:00:34] <+ReallyBigRocks> good lord
[3:00:34] <+MidnightBurst12> noice
[3:00:34] <ferretking131> yo you parried that fire bomb that was bs
[3:00:38] <CunnymobileBrakeFluid> @MicrotonalMatt I see you, brother tdogJimn
[3:00:39] <%AncelDeLambert> Paige, I respect the attempt, but I think you'll just have to give the parry crown to Reggie
[3:00:39] <%g0atmeal> this much health 👌
[3:00:40] <$Afterman_> @MicrotonalMatt are you ready for your nft of louisoix's death? Kappa
[3:00:41] <%BlackSunEmperor> all praise the magic pixel
[3:00:44] <%Keyd00d> Uncharted territory
[3:00:51] <+FingaLights> Parry a Grenade
[3:00:56] <+extradopeness> october 21 is my bday so i have a very strong memory of all the BttF2 business
[3:00:56] <%JenovasPuppet> That was EVERYONE'S first Demons Souls experience
[3:00:56] <LeeOhX> I remember when Reggie was playing this, he parried an arrow I think and everyone was surprised
[3:00:56] <SilverFaustX> PB
[3:00:58] <MicrotonalMatt> @cunnymobilebrakefluid tdogWizz
[3:00:59] <brachydios777> Why are game companies trying to make nfts a thing? Cause it will actually laughablely make them very little money
[3:01:09] <%mastermindgoblin> @SoFarFetched i mean, totally fair, but also my comment wouldn't make much sense if I wasn't in their timezone lol
[3:01:16] <%g0atmeal> @LeeOhX I remember Woolie taking the controller out of his hands when he kept using firebombs LUL
[3:01:17] <buerdo> @peachsaliva happy new year from New brunswick
[3:01:18] <yukichocomilk> @brachydios777 they love scams
[3:01:24] <tigerfang86> TOXIC
[3:01:27] <Cosairen> @brachydios777 the idea of controlling the secondary market is like crack to them
[3:01:28] <%JenovasPuppet> I think I got to the top of the ramparts before I dropped the game for 5 years.
[3:01:28] <+Undenizen> @brachydios777 because it's free money, a small number of people like it, and it's not properly regulated yet.
[3:01:28] <+ReallyBigRocks> LUL
[3:01:40] <square__1> any money is money they didn't have before
[3:01:41] <AMajorTom> @Undenizen You mean Chistopher Lee Sauroman, who was a spy in WWII
[3:01:41] <linSP> all my damage for range
[3:01:44] <%mastermindgoblin> @brachydios777 moneymoneymoneymoneymoneymoneymoney
[3:01:46] <SilverFaustX> that wall is dead
[3:01:47] <+zamatermort> Yeah kill that wall!
[3:01:55] <+MetroidSlayerP7> but it's historically accurate!!1!
[3:01:55] <ferretking131> that was weird
[3:01:58] <LeeOhX> @g0atmeal that was the funniest shit ever LOL he put them away too and Reggie got so mad
[3:02:03] <+Undenizen> @AMajorTom I did mean that. My bad.
[3:02:11] <+extradopeness> oh the taste of your lips are murdeous ya toxic im slippin under
[3:02:11] <%spongeofmystery> sipsipSipsipblind
[3:02:13] <SivSarcast> NFTs will flop. Telling people to eat bugs won't flop as hard, and that's what scares me.
[3:02:22] <brachydios777> Didn’t Unbisoft only make like $300 when they tried nfts?
[3:02:32] <ferretking131> i love new parrying paige
[3:02:34] <AMajorTom> @Undenizen I love that fact, and that he was such a badass.
[3:02:45] <$Afterman_> @SivSarcast unless you live for a few more hundred years, i dont think bug protein will become that popular/widely needed
[3:02:46] <%mastermindgoblin> @brachydios777 according to the bit Pat described on the podcast, they lost like 150k
[3:02:48] <+extradopeness> that parry owns
[3:02:50] <yukichocomilk> @brachydios777 nah they spent more than they made afaik

[3:06:10] <brachydios777> @undenizen This makes me think of a theory of how to find out if a company is run by idiots who don’t know how money works, see if they try to implement nfts
[3:06:12] <AMajorTom> Take that, fiend!
[3:06:12] <$Afterman_> @mastermindgoblin also bugs are apparently super nutritious, and easy to "farm". its just just tryna make it.. appealing to the masses is hard.

[3:15:45] <tigerfang86> Victory is Victory!
[3:15:52] <+kurejichi> sipsipGasm_TK
[3:15:53] <%mastermindgoblin> It basically is cheating
[3:15:54] <%Keyd00d> Royal super carried me through my first souls game
[3:15:55] <+Mekhet09> If you want to stick with magic, you have to commit.
[3:15:56] <%mastermindgoblin> but also fuck it
[3:16:00] <%JenovasPuppet> I mean I just shot things with my wand for the whole game
[3:16:00] <Dragon_Batman> Yea that's fair
[3:16:05] <linSP> cheat lie steal!
[3:16:06] <Laecerelius> Just cheat!
[3:16:06] <Zombrocom> FUCK YEAH CHEAT THIS BULLSHIT
[3:16:07] <%g0atmeal> @patriotrenegade but how did it get the first 499 likes?
[3:16:10] <+FingaLights> BIG CHEAT
[3:16:10] <%legendfather_of_giants> PUT THT SHIT On
[3:16:13] <brachydios777> It’s the Hellsing mentality of “your powers are bullshit”
[3:16:13] <+RedSharkHC> Bling Ring
[3:16:15] <tentavision> WE GOT IT
[3:16:17] <ferretking131> thas a good ring
[3:16:21] <scrumbotime> They FIXED that bug in this version, I had to do the fight legit
[3:16:22] <%Orcapugs> That feeling never goes away
[3:16:22] <%cobalt_phoenix_> never ever take it off
[3:16:22] <tigerfang86> eyyyyyyy
[3:16:27] <@commanderclaw> Thanks Dark Souls 1 Marketing for fucking up the fanbase
[3:16:27] <%mastermindgoblin> Demon's has some really dumb bullshit, fuck yeah CHEAT LIKE A WINNER
[3:16:28] <GarbageQueenEllie> The "Who's texting you right now?" Ring.
[3:16:30] <Dragon_Batman> Never take it off like 90% of the time
[3:16:31] <+Logoth_> cling ring do your thing!
[3:16:34] <+ReallyBigRocks> yay corpses!
[3:16:34] <SGrim> 75% PogChamp
[3:16:36] <linSP> that ring is basic cheats
[3:16:38] <Marhunter7> Demon souls is: Cheat as hard as you can, break the game, become OP
[3:16:38] <+HelveticaScenario> So the community isn't a bunch of try hards?
[3:16:38] <JackaxeAM> Hoo-ray for shortcut
[3:16:39] <scrublord009> Hey pizza pasta force
[3:16:40] <+extradopeness> actually owning a ps5 and playing anything on it besides the DeS remake is goofy shoes
[3:16:42] <Jerp> the dark souls community got really heavy into difficulty circlejerking and "git gud, scrub". Demons souls on the other hand was "oh thank fuck I'm glad I made it, you need any help?"
[3:16:43] <%legendfather_of_giants> jade egg?
[3:16:52] <+AlucardX60> That's not true. It's morally the right thing to do to cheat in Dark Souls as well.
[3:17:05] <+fatty_rangel> hello peach
[3:17:09] <%mastermindgoblin> I mean, learning how to cheat is part of "git gud" lol
[3:17:13] <ferretking131> i clapped along to that
[3:17:13] <+MisterAvry> that was jaunty
[3:17:13] <linSP> did paige pick up the smelly armor?
[3:17:15] <%Keyd00d> Only cool people cheese the bosses
[3:17:16] <$SvenHolgersson> Cheating is Dark Souls is the correct move much like real life
[3:17:17] <SivSarcast> I hope Elden Ring keeps up the shortcut porn, and not just the Skyrim dungeon exit shenanigans.
[3:17:19] <Dragon_Batman> Nah take it
[3:17:24] <GarbageQueenEllie> Well, royal has the best outfit AND stats, so I'm all in!
[3:17:29] <+megaotter> what a banger
[3:17:30] <+Mekhet09> Depends on the people.
[3:17:34] <+RandyFistburgers> Fuckin play to win

[3:19:16] <%g0atmeal> i literally can't wait until 2022
[3:19:19] <+Mekhet09> In demon souls there are things that straight up cheat and it's bulllshit like the dragons don't even give you a pretense of a fair fight.
[3:19:19] <BisoromiBear> @Tawbah_ the future refused to change
[3:19:22] <%JenovasPuppet> You WILL know when it's time for the first boss

[3:22:34] <+Mekhet09> I hate ostrava's design in the remake. He should be pure gold.
[3:22:34] <%TheLemuroid> Is his the guy that needs to be escorted?
[3:22:34] <brachydios777> Harry potter would be much different is someone pulled out an m4 or some shit

[3:23:27] <+Tucker0603> PAIGE IS SO BLIND
[3:23:40] <+ikantreeed> magic looks so good in this game
[3:23:42] <%StephanieSadGirl> Be like Reggie, Paige, and backstab him!

[3:24:42] <brachydios777> @mastermindgoblin Also hogwarts seems a lot less impressive in hindsight when that whole shit can come crumbling down with a b2 bomber or etc

[3:31:46] <hoagie_in_disguise> Did Paige forget that this is Dark Souls?

[3:31:49] <AMajorTom> Thank the peopo, and say g'night.
[3:31:52] <brachydios777> Is the world building in Harry Potter actually bullshit, is that what I’m learning?

[3:33:09] <MidnightPacif1c> brittlWobbleBee
[3:33:11] <%StephanieSadGirl> Does Paige have her own discord?
[3:33:11] <%Keyd00d> they LOVE being slaves

[3:33:25] <%mastermindgoblin> Just pay them in socks and they couldn't be happier
[3:33:30] <@SoFarFetched> @StephanieSadGirl yup you just gotta make sure your discord is connected to your twitch and you can join from there
[3:33:36] <@SoFarFetched> It is a Sub only discord.
[3:33:43] <brachydios777> The “they actually love being slave” will be super racist every time
[3:34:01] <%StephanieSadGirl> I gotta check to see if its linked, I thought I did but havent gotten pat or paige's...
[3:34:06] <%mastermindgoblin> "Being a slave is totally gnarly" -Dobby probably

[3:34:26] <SilverFaustX> some asshole doing fireworks at 530am here
[3:34:28] <@SoFarFetched> @StephanieSadGirl yeah once you do your twitch connection on discord,it will sync to who you're currently subbed to that have a discord and you can join from there.
[3:34:31] <@SoFarFetched> @Taisuru try a refresh
[3:34:44] <brachydios777> @silverfaustx Well, fuck them then
[3:34:48] <+Undenizen> yeah JK tried really hard to be progressive. She actually did. Unfortunately she has a very outside-in view of minorities.

[3:36:11] <%RayReborne> i want to SLEEP lol
[3:36:25] <%mastermindgoblin> @Undenizen I mean, I guess, kinda reminds me of characters shows that wanna be PC, but end up saying extremely racist things in attempts to be nice to minorities

[3:38:36] <+Undenizen> @mastermindgoblin it's like when elderly folks say there's no way they can be racist because they respect how asians are good at maths.
[3:38:37] <%mastermindgoblin> GiefStaresAt Demon's Souls when?!

[3:39:55] <%walternatorz> Paige's brand is all over the place.
[3:39:56] <oda_flobunaga> MOAR VORE
[3:40:00] <%JenovasPuppet> It wasn't QUITE unfollow worthy, but it was damn close!
[3:40:04] <Zeif00> Justin gives NO fucks
[3:40:05] <@SoFarFetched> Im too used to being sent cursed that seeing it on Paige's feed looked fine to me geefBlank
[3:40:05] <jowi_time> woooo 20mins !!!!!
[3:40:06] <%Agami23> people were screaming in the discord servers i go to, and i was like "that seems about right"
[3:40:06] <%Keyd00d> I just scroll past
[3:40:07] <+realm_forge> You literally gave me a headache
[3:40:10] <$luckypineapple> cheer500 Hey Paige, happy new year. What do you think is one of the underappreciated Final Fantasy games? Also I cannot tell you guys enough about how much seratonin Zangieff and your abraham lincoln panic provides me and my gf
[3:40:12] <%mastermindgoblin> I follow Paige because of moments like when she described how she used to go dumpster diving and horrified pat
[3:40:18] <MyNameIsRasus> i mean tbf vore was out of left field
[3:40:23] <Coystick> I wish Ping would stop posting big gay bowser
[3:40:33] <fruit_pie_the_magician> Fromsoft seems to REALLY like magic, but then they feel bad that everyone is using it to steamroll their game
[3:40:34] <%VashyronM> I don't even think Paige's twitter is that bad. Maybe that says something about me
[3:40:40] <Dragon_Batman> 9 maybe?
[3:40:45] <%Keyd00d> psaGiefrail
[3:40:46] <AMajorTom> FF IV stream soon, I bet
[3:40:47] <+zamatermort> 3 is super underrated
[3:40:48] <+Mekhet09> @PeachSaliva Magic is op in bloodborne but you have to heavily wait fo rit to get good.
[3:40:48] <%mastermindgoblin> @MyNameIsRasus whyyyyyyyyy
[3:40:48] <$luckypineapple> HES SO BIG AND SUCH A LOVELY BOY
[3:40:57] <oda_flobunaga> @PeachSaliva as long as you don't post Guro...
[3:41:03] <Qsmash_> 5 is awesome
[3:41:08] <%mastermindgoblin> 4 is really good
[3:41:08] <+FingaLights> ye
[3:41:10] <%VashyronM> 9 is great
[3:41:11] <jowi_time> 9 is awesome!!
[3:41:16] <%JenovasPuppet> "9 is underrated" LUL LUL LUL
[3:41:16] <brachydios777> I feel like people who say Paige’s twitter is bad doesn’t know how bad it can actually be
[3:41:17] <%DianaTheAscian> 9 is a lot less underated nowadays
[3:41:19] <%Keyd00d> 9 is my favorite
[3:41:19] <MyNameIsRasus> 9 better than 7 fight me
[3:41:19] <%NigelSchnauzerpug> Is there any that you think is overrated?
[3:41:23] <%Agami23> i really need to play 9
[3:41:27] <Treasure_Vault> None of them are final, some of them are sci fi.
[3:41:29] <%VashyronM> Crazy Talk activated
[3:41:30] <%ChestMimik> Oh
[3:41:30] <%walternatorz> NAILED
[3:41:30] <Coystick> I never played 6 will one day
[3:41:30] <+MetroidSlayerP7> 5 job system is really fun
[3:41:32] <%TigerCatGo> HA!!!!!
[3:41:34] <%DianaTheAscian> I would die for Vivi
[3:41:35] <%legendfather_of_giants> i had someone yesterday tell me 2 is underrted
[3:41:35] <%Agami23> ff9 is the ff14 of final fantasy
[3:41:38] <%mastermindgoblin> I'm not sure if 4 is underrated cuz I never hear people talk about it lol
[3:41:39] <%Keyd00d> 9 is super underrated
[3:41:41] <%TigerCatGo> I understood her, because I'm also drunk
[3:41:42] <yukichocomilk> SHORTcut eh?
[3:41:42] <peachy996> Makes perfect sense to me
[3:41:43] <CrypticMochi> I need a good port of 5 or something
[3:41:44] <+VentWilsn> i should play the 9 whenever i actually beat 8
[3:41:51] <brachydios777> Raise your shield!
[3:41:53] <fruit_pie_the_magician> It's not as bad as the 7 popeye shit
[3:41:58] <Treasure_Vault> Vivi is a VILF
[3:42:13] <thunderborn32> how are you enjoying your poking stick? i know you usually like 2 handers
[3:42:13] <%Keyd00d> Yeah if people can stomach the 7 models they got no excuse
[3:42:13] <%JenovasPuppet> If you were to poll people on their favorite (non-mmo) FFs, IX would be an EASY third place, behind VI and VII.
[3:42:23] <signofzeta> even the low-level samurai in sekiro do it
[3:42:27] <%greasypete00> and then optimized the shit out of it
[3:42:32] <$luckypineapple> have we decided on a build or are we yoloing it?
[3:42:36] <+Undenizen> it's a GOOD flail
[3:42:38] <%mastermindgoblin> @JenovasPuppet you might be underestimating how many people genuinely love X
[3:42:39] <captwolfaroo> I haven't been able to get into any FF because it's not miserable enough, but 6 was close
[3:42:40] <Reveresao> And you die to it in every game
[3:42:51] <FunkyStreams> NICE SPACING
[3:42:57] <MyNameIsRasus> i wish xiv was single player so i could enjoy it
[3:43:04] <BisoromiBear> X-2 is the underratedest
[3:43:08] <+ikantreeed> @PeachSaliva Did u guys also get scared by that phone alert?
[3:43:09] <oda_flobunaga> 10-2 and 13-2 are terrible, and also underrated
[3:43:10] <%mastermindgoblin> @MyNameIsRasus you can play Solo no problem
[3:43:10] <+MetroidSlayerP7> it's like the old game is controlling fancy new puppets.  kinda wild, actually.
[3:43:14] <thunderborn32> if she wont block shouldn't she just 2 hand?
[3:43:16] <brachydios777> We’ve gone full circle from drop to now raise your shield
[3:43:18] <+Undenizen> do you think magic burns? or stings?
[3:43:24] <+aliceisneato> they dont even really update the graphics between games too much, DeS armors barely look different from DS3s armors in Cinders
[3:43:27] <ferretking131> ran over the item and even made a racecar noise
[3:43:38] <%JenovasPuppet> XIII-2 is unironic GOAT (as long as you don't care at all about story in your RPG lol)
[3:43:43] <FunkyStreams> its like listerine
[3:43:45] <+Ne1son> Ah yes the cold burn
[3:43:48] <+MidnightBurst12> it tickles so hard it hurts
[3:43:49] <+ReallyBigRocks> spearmint fire
[3:43:52] <%Agami23> i always imagined magic had a sort of electric burn to it. at least with a soul spear
[3:43:56] <oda_flobunaga> !0-2 straight up has the best oldschool ATB system Square ever produced
[3:44:01] <%mastermindgoblin> I never touched any of the additional 13 stuff because 13 itself is TRASH
[3:44:05] <MyNameIsRasus> @mastermindgoblin there are tons of dungeons that require other people, and multiplayer of any kind gives me anxiety
[3:44:06] <$luckypineapple> FFX I think is a game that has had its reputation genuinely harmed by the memes created by it
[3:44:08] <+ikantreeed> Magic burn u but in ur mouth, like u drank something way too hot
[3:44:20] <%RNGbob> RNGbob subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 38 months! Remember 2021 couldn't have been the worst year. It can only be the worst year so far. Happy NY gang
[3:44:26] <secret_npc> Did Lightning Returns do what X-2 did?
[3:44:28] <FunkyStreams> yee-
[3:44:29] <%Ranryu692> nice landing, guy
[3:44:29] <brachydios777> 13 is the dark age of Final Fantasy
[3:44:30] <+Undenizen> PFFT
[3:44:37] <%thejimjamz> thejimjamz subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 26 months, currently on a 21 month streak! Happy new year peach! The wife and I weren't able to make many streams but you remain a highlight whenever we watch. here's to more fears of the unknown in 2022
[3:44:38] <thunderborn32> im just happy that with 16 they're going witcher style and throwing item menus away
[3:44:45] <SivSarcast> I like how the guy grunted like his knees creaked or smth.
[3:44:46] <+ikantreeed> that was a nice jump lowkey
[3:44:53] <oda_flobunaga> 13-2 has one of the best villains Square has ever written, in an otherwise awful game
[3:45:00] <%mastermindgoblin> @MyNameIsRasus you can queue up and do dungeons without talking to the other people, but yeah the anxiety is totally fair, that's a bummer
[3:45:01] <Dragon_Batman> I've always thought 13 was passable personally
[3:45:05] <%ChestMimik> UGH
[3:45:06] <%walternatorz> ughhh
[3:45:09] <FunkyStreams> that guy was waiting for his chance to pounce on someone for like 300 years, only to totally overdo it.
[3:45:09] <%greasypete00> i feel like magic would be like the kind of burning you feel when you go from really cold into a warmer place
[3:45:10] <%KetsuoTaberu> excuse me
[3:45:15] <%RayReborne> Paige i found the vore tweets and tbh, not that bad, also funny Kappa

[3:46:14] <ytwitchmeng> What is a New Years tradition you would do when you were a kid?

[3:46:33] <oda_flobunaga> @brachydios777 so 13's plot is basically FF7 R's plot about defying fate but with character's you hate

[3:47:01] <FunkyStreams> trippy
[3:47:10] <%thejimjamz> I remember watching the Spongebob future episode on new years 1999

[3:47:19] <%DianaTheAscian> Paige.
[3:47:21] <Reveresao> Not me.
[3:47:22] <+FingaLights> Y3K is gonna be lit tho
[3:47:24] <%legendfather_of_giants> surviving Y2K with leonard Nemoy
[3:47:25] <%Keyd00d> and then Alex YIIk freaked out
[3:47:26] <brachydios777> Also wasn’t Snow voiced by Troy Baker?
[3:47:27] <$luckypineapple> cheer500 I have been bouncing off of FF9 a bit (First time playing it was this year) because its combat has NOT aged well and Zidane sucks. But Freya is bae and Vivi and Garnet are perfect and its the first game I got to play a nonbinary voraphile. Bless Quina
[3:47:28] <%JenovasPuppet> Planes falling from the sky!
[3:47:28] <+cvp5127> more like y2gay
[3:47:31] <%FacetiousAF> i remember thinking the moulin rouge music video was basically porn
[3:47:31] <FunkyStreams> I hope John Connor will save us
[3:47:33] <secret_npc> If they did The Purge but for Twitch wut would you do?
[3:47:34] <peachy996> Who didn't hide under the recliner portion of their chair as a kid?
[3:47:34] <MyNameIsRasus> y69k is where it's at
[3:47:36] <SivSarcast> I remember waking up on new Year's day at the turn of the millenium in 2000 and my parents weren't at home. I was a kid alone at home. It was weird.
[3:47:39] <Qsmash_> Chris Jericho was gonna end the world
[3:47:40] <+Undenizen> i remember the millennium. i was allowed to have champagne when i was 11.
[3:47:43] <AMajorTom> Like 5 people got letters dated 1900. That's it.
[3:47:44] <%mastermindgoblin> @brachydios777 Isn't everyone voiced by Troy Baker?
[3:47:47] <+TheMattman1313> Robbed by good programming practice
[3:47:48] <sirrice77> well y2k was averted by a ton of people working to avoid it
[3:47:51] <jowi_time> my cousin and I huddle together with flashlights
[3:47:52] <+ikantreeed> zanbeef
[3:47:55] <yukichocomilk> 2000 wasn't even the new millenium, that was 2001
[3:47:57] <GarbageQueenEllie> Kith dog
[3:47:59] <oda_flobunaga> I actually had a computer game that set its internal clock to 1900 on New Years 2000
[3:48:00] <Jerp> actual y2k will be about 16 years from now
[3:48:03] <thunderborn32> i just remember as a child thinking that myth of y2k was dumb
[3:48:17] <%Keyd00d> Well it wasn't so bad because preparations were in place
[3:48:20] <tanarath> Is pat like the possum kissing guy, but for zangief?
[3:48:23] <%mastermindgoblin> @Jerp what happens in 2038?
[3:48:24] <+JustToWatch> idk maybe we all died in Y2K, that would explain a lot
[3:48:26] <Dragon_Batman> Yea this game had it tougher with the wall stuff if I remember right
[3:48:27] <luckypineapple> i remember thinking y2k was people talking about Chris Jericho
[3:48:28] <Hydrapissed> waabyuComf
[3:48:29] <SGrim> @ChestMimik but Christr is too slippery to be pinned down. All his most ardent followers are talking about Jehovah's Wetness.
[3:48:33] <+BlackStarAura> heart butt
[3:48:33] <%Ranryu692> Is "stinky" just a universal nickname for pets?
[3:48:36] <Zeif00> 2012 had the same energy
[3:48:37] <%mastermindgoblin> guys I think we have a time traveller in chat
[3:48:37] <%ChestMimik> @Jerp Look, I can only fit about eight or nine apocalypses in my schedule to care about
[3:48:39] <+Ne1son> What a lordly dog he is
[3:48:50] <%NigelSchnauzerpug> 10 minutes!
[3:48:50] <brachydios777> Just saying, hearing Troy Baker in Final Fantasy is like hearing Nolan North in Final Fantasy, not something I’m used to
[3:48:52] <medril07> Gief a big bastard now
[3:48:57] <Jerp> mastermindgoblin year 2038 problem --- 32-bit computers won't be able to handle the date format. some mortgage companies and others that plan for super long terms already hit it
[3:49:02] <+Undenizen> @Ranryu692 i think they both literally just smell bad.
[3:49:06] <thunderborn32> remember that preacher that told thousands of people the earth was going to end and they should sell all their stuff, and then it didn't happen?
[3:49:06] <+trizetacannon44> Lift you shield
[3:49:08] <captwolfaroo> Rock out with your block out
[3:49:09] <%mastermindgoblin> Jerp comes from the future bearing a grim warning, will we listen?!
[3:49:19] <+zamatermort> Fuck them stairs
[3:49:24] <+AmanisHouseOfNonsense> 10 minutes!
[3:49:28] <Treasure_Vault> I was there for the Word of Jerp
[3:49:29] <GarbageQueenEllie> New Car smell
[3:49:29] <ferretking131> my dogs p stinky
[3:49:35] <%mastermindgoblin> LUL
[3:49:38] <+ikantreeed> U think Zangief would choose to link the fire?
[3:49:39] <%greasypete00> i know what kinda smell
[3:49:42] <%Ranryu692> @Ranryu692 Yeah, but I also call my dog "stinky" even if she's just had a bath
[3:49:43] <Jerp> well, more specifically 32-bit integers being used for timestamps, I believe
[3:49:44] <+MidnightBurst12> clean dog smell
[3:49:45] <+Undenizen> My rats smell nice.
[3:49:47] <+FingaLights> @mastermindgoblin The future refused to change
[3:49:47] <%Agami23> zangief looks like he would smell good and feel good to pet.
[3:49:48] <+RandyFistburgers> dogs smell like soap
[3:49:53] <CrypticMochi> The dog musk
[3:49:54] <Dragon_Batman> Yea, there is like a clean dog type of smell
[3:49:54] <%mastermindgoblin> Activate.... the fart cannon!
[3:49:58] <luckypineapple> get excited for ABORTION lake
[3:50:03] <+Taisuru> Speaking of blast, the gief cannon is pointed right at ya
[3:50:05] <+Ne1son> I wish I had a dog to pet
[3:50:13] <%Agami23> his coat has always looked so pretty and healthy. i love seeing him
[3:50:14] <%ChestMimik> @Jerp What, you really think companies out there are still using outdated tech? Hahahaha-*sobs uncontrolalbly*
[3:50:15] <%generalve> Why does Zangief always have his tongue out when sleeping
[3:50:17] <%JenovasPuppet> Describe with at least 5 adjectives how soft his fur is.
[3:50:20] <@SoFarFetched> she saw red and assumed explosilves
[3:50:20] <%legendfather_of_giants> it takes fire to set them off
[3:50:21] <GarbageQueenEllie> @luckypineapple omg is that real? That sounds metal
[3:50:22] <+Undenizen> "no."
[3:50:23] <Jerp> ChestMimik lol
[3:50:24] <@SoFarFetched> explosives*
[3:50:35] <%mastermindgoblin> Gief cannon makes me think of that stupid weapon from FF8 where the black hair chick shoots her dog at people
[3:50:37] <ferretking131> "no"
[3:50:48] <%JenovasPuppet> Fucking OWNED
[3:50:49] <luckypineapple> @GarbageQueenEllie look up 5-3 for Demons Souls

[3:50:55] <+FingaLights> @mastermindgoblin I love that attack
[3:50:57] <+Undenizen> i cant believe how good that spell is.
[3:50:57] <%legendfather_of_giants> @GarbageQueenEllie that's 5-3
[3:51:02] <%mastermindgoblin> dogs make for surprisingly effective ballistic missiles apparently
[3:51:04] <%thejimjamz> @mastermindgoblin Angelo canon with zangief would oneshot anything in that game
[3:51:16] <%SharkMissile> Is Paige gonna get all the coins? sipsipDab

[4:12:16] <$DensityD> you ran....very far away
[4:12:24] <BisoromiBear> @mastermindgoblin some people are into that
[4:12:27] <Hypnotoad0823> Happy new year Paige

[4:12:48] <%Tenchi_G> almost
[4:12:48] <+MisterAvry> he has a range, you ran out of range
[4:12:49] <%KeiganOfAstora> n
[4:12:52] <Dunmarkh> NotLikeThis
[4:12:55] <+MooseIsGoose> Tonight was my night and I wear it with honor
[4:12:57] <Dragon_Batman> Drake is angry
[4:12:58] <%mastermindgoblin> @silentshrug but what if you are wammin?
[4:13:00] <TheHeroAppears> oh boy
[4:13:01] <AMajorTom> Baba didn't like that

[4:13:18] <DancesWitBalrog> THE GEARS ARE TURNING
[4:13:35] <%optimasmaximas> yes pat
[4:13:36] <waltzqueen> @PeachSaliva Pat please buy this woman glasses for every birthday
[4:13:40] <$DensityD> protip: true cowards who do not go forward a little bit will never beat the game
[4:13:49] <Sunstalker> It's really convenient that every dragon in this game has no object permanance. Idiot dragons
[4:13:50] <silentshrug> The hint actually backfired
[4:14:02] <%KeiganOfAstora> That's not the floor, it's the ground
[4:14:19] <$SvenHolgersson> NOW RUN
[4:14:21] <%JenovasPuppet> Good job!
[4:14:26] <cloakofashes> Now run.
[4:14:29] <Dunmarkh> artful rolling
[4:14:32] <%mastermindgoblin> @KeiganOfAstora the ground is made of bricks?
[4:14:38] <$DensityD> as much rolling as possible, when nothing was really near
[4:14:38] <+FingaLights> "No......"
[4:14:38] <+RemedyofRevenge> brown bricks
[4:14:45] <%KeiganOfAstora> Floor is indoor, idk what to call this @mastermindgoblin
[4:14:45] <AMajorTom> and then what happened
[4:14:48] <%optimasmaximas> ….
[4:14:48] <%JenovasPuppet> Go go go go go!
[4:15:07] <%JenovasPuppet> sipsipGears sipsipGears sipsipGears sipsipGears
[4:15:11] <designergaze> Hello. Happy New Year! It's 2022 in NYC/
[4:15:39] <%mastermindgoblin> I legit never knew "floor" was based on being indoors, I thought it just mean any surface you walk on that is man made.
[4:15:53] <%legendfather_of_giants> dont do that tho the timings rough
[4:15:55] <AMajorTom> 2022 is happening
[4:16:04] <SilverFaustX> ass in face
[4:16:05] <+Taisuru> Big ol baby
[4:16:06] <Dragon_Batman> The best boi
[4:16:08] <$DensityD> wonder how long we would have been there without Pat Hints. [btw pAt RuInS dEmOnS sOuLs evRyTimE]
[4:16:08] <+RemedyofRevenge> in perfect position to fart in your face
[4:16:09] <+Undenizen> is "lying" the right word?
[4:16:10] <+Fetrigon> ye get him gief
[4:16:11] <luckypineapple> BAAAAAAAAAAYBE
[4:16:12] <+MooseIsGoose> Is he pouting because paige said no
[4:16:14] <+FingaLights> BUTT in face
[4:16:25] <%mastermindgoblin> Gief has big Iggy energy rn
[4:16:26] <+ReallyBigRocks> blasting stance
[4:16:28] <+RandyFistburgers> Beef stew orientation
[4:16:29] <dan_g_v> cutie
[4:16:29] <OvaltineDream> poot
[4:16:34] <%legendfather_of_giants> Woolie was way too hands-off with Reggie imo
[4:16:37] <%mastermindgoblin> Does Gief want coffee flavored gum?
[4:16:37] <+Taisuru> Locked and loaded
[4:16:42] <VritraReiRei> I thought we were suddenly done playing LUL
[4:16:45] <+RemedyofRevenge> getting those pupper roni farts in your face
[4:16:47] <$DensityD> cool spear
[4:16:49] <+FadingEmber> to be fair telling someone to run in the direction the dragon is coming is a bit counter intuitive for new players
[4:16:50] <luckypineapple> time to go fight the cow pat monster
[4:17:01] <Dragon_Batman> Good job making it through so far
[4:17:03] <SivSarcast> You flinched, Paige. There is beeyitch in your heart.
[4:17:03] <Dunmarkh> the fun weapon
[4:17:17] <dan_g_v> ze bad man
[4:17:17] <+Undenizen> it took paige more than a year to reach the boss.
[4:17:19] <$DensityD> cool javelin in the cutscene
[4:17:35] <%legendfather_of_giants> noice
[4:17:47] <SGrim> Note: Paige's reaction time seems to improve when inebriated.
[4:18:01] <%mastermindgoblin> Paige started DeS in 2021, and in 2022 she's still on 1-1. I wonder how far she'll get by 2023?
[4:18:14] <+Undenizen> @SGrim i get like that when i do my job too tbh
[4:18:20] <$DensityD> sipsipElmo_SQ
[4:18:24] <%KetsuoTaberu> that's good
[4:18:27] <+Freakin_Wolfy> "Not my finest moment" really should be the name of this channel
[4:18:30] <$vile_brand> 4 steps exactly
[4:18:33] <Dragon_Batman> Just beat it over spring, it'll be easy
[4:18:33] <SivSarcast> @mastermindgoblin Das pretty good.
[4:18:33] <@Jekado> Beat it by FALL
[4:18:40] <+Logoth_> Look forward to it
[4:18:42] <Hydrapissed> FALL
[4:18:45] <+RemedyofRevenge> I am so pumped for the next ultrakill update, Im thinking of speedrunning that game
[4:18:45] <+VentWilsn> were the demon souls levels named like 1-1 in the original too?
[4:18:46] <%optimasmaximas> LUL
[4:18:50] <%mastermindgoblin> Jokes aside, Paige is genuinely crushing it so far
[4:18:53] <+Mekhet09> It sucks.
[4:19:00] <$DensityD> that is, or is not, the scraping spear from the gate cutscene?
[4:19:02] <LankySensei> I haven't seen much of DSR but holy fuck this sound design is amazing
[4:19:03] <Admiral_PopnFresh> ITS SO BUSTED
[4:19:04] <%legendfather_of_giants> that is a Hoplite
[4:19:07] <SivSarcast> Oh yeah, the lock-on in the Cinders mod is AMAZING.
[4:19:18] <Dragon_Batman> Oh man she is gonna be fine when the time comes LUL
[4:19:24] <%mastermindgoblin> @VentWilsn the names like 1-1 are just player given I think, I'm not sure if the game ever refers to them that way, but we have been saying that since the OG.
[4:19:29] <+Mekhet09> maneater fight with magic is awful.
[4:19:32] <AMajorTom> bonfires are a myth
[4:19:34] <Admiral_PopnFresh> So much LIGHTNING
[4:19:35] <$DensityD> did pat explain the advantages of 2-handing against shield enemies yet?
[4:19:36] <%legendfather_of_giants> they shoot
[4:19:38] <+Logoth_> Even uhh
[4:19:38] <+RemedyofRevenge> even-UH
[4:19:39] <Profmcstevie> We didn't exist those yet
[4:19:44] <%KeiganOfAstora> You could just use a bow Pat and aim
[4:19:56] <FunkyStreams> if you look for the shadowy figure in the shadowy place, you;ll fins em no problem
[4:19:57] <cloakofashes> Pat, c'mon, you know that her looking right at it doesn't matter.
[4:20:02] <tanarath> please get glasses
[4:20:06] <$DensityD> a pile of goo with a shield and spear, what a strange enemy
[4:20:13] <%JenovasPuppet> Too bad mankind has yet to invent some sort of eyeball enhancement device you can wear on your face.

[4:24:51] <AMajorTom> oh no.
[4:24:52] <+Mekhet09> @PeachSaliva Pat you should let her try it once before giving advice. In my opinion, it'd be a balance between blind and helping.

[4:27:32] <$DensityD> please don't touch the archstone
[4:27:35] <Dragon_Batman> Yea Phalanx is a bit more of a puzzle LUL
[4:27:38] <%mastermindgoblin> it was the easiest boss in the game, you absolutely spammed firebombs, and you STILL almost died
[4:27:43] <%JenovasPuppet> Phalanx is hard as balls without firebombs.
[4:27:44] <+Undenizen> a human is you
[4:27:45] <luckypineapple> LEAVE BEFORE YOU GET INVADED
[4:27:46] <%walternatorz> a good partner always keeps you grounded

[4:28:54] <+FadingEmber> After 4hrs you can finally level up. Man, I hate how demon's is structured.
[4:28:57] <DXLelouch24> time to commit suicide
[4:29:08] <%mastermindgoblin> Kill yourself (in minecraft)

[4:29:29] <$vile_brand> yea you might wanna bump the brightness up a touch
[4:29:30] <@SoFarFetched> its dark alright, oh and the lighting isn't alot geefSmugAF
[4:29:32] <+FingaLights> It does look very dark on my side as well
[4:29:33] <Admiral_PopnFresh> a dark Souls game?
[4:29:34] <%NigelSchnauzerpug> Isn't Dead by Daylight also a dark game?
[4:29:34] <RetributionP> WEAR YOUR GLASSES
[4:29:35] <Dragon_Batman> Ahh he's nodding. Okie dokie then
[4:29:39] <FunkyStreams> I would've thought a game by the name of Demon's Souls would be so much more well-lit.
[4:29:40] <$SvenHolgersson> nope
[4:29:40] <+RandyFistburgers> not enough light getting into them balls
[4:29:40] <+AlucardX60> The game is actually kinda dark.
[4:29:41] <AsHeadsIsTails> It's not Dark its Demons
[4:29:44] <+FadingEmber> @FadingEmber that is also fair
[4:29:44] <brachydios777> suicide is badass!

[4:29:59] <luckypineapple> The Valley of Defilment is gonna be ROUGH
[4:30:00] <%JenovasPuppet> But it's Perfectly Calibrated
[4:30:00] <greenoni> Your problem is you aren't wearing your damn glasses!

[4:30:13] <ExpressNode> How do you get HDR working in OBS?
[4:30:18] <secret_npc> Brightness or maybe some PS5 accessibility?
[4:30:24] <%TheWinged7> pat HDR makes the darker parts darker
[4:30:25] <%ChestMimik> Paige's Sharingon is failing her
[4:30:26] <%legendfather_of_giants> the brightness isnt great, but it's also your glasses Paige

[4:37:44] <@Jekado> BATTLE TENDENCY
[4:37:44] <AMajorTom> Kay why ess
[4:37:44] <%TigerCatGo> We should have made a poll for the jump LUL
[4:37:46] <%legendfather_of_giants> DS3 poise exists Pat

[4:37:52] <tanarath> It's the E V I L
[4:37:52] <%mastermindgoblin> Yeah, i think it's the dumbest system they've made by a wide margin

[4:37:52] <$SvenHolgersson> THE WORST THING IN ANY OF THE GAMES
[4:37:59] <splicerss> damn its so nice to see siblings hanging out on New Years
[4:38:09] <oda_flobunaga> What about the Horse fuck valley System?
[4:38:09] <%mastermindgoblin> WT is way worse than DS3 poise
[4:38:12] <+MidnightBurst12> ???
[4:38:13] <+Fetrigon> *plays super mario 64 file select music*
[4:38:18] <linSP> if you die with body form, the game gets HARDER, and the worse you do, and the HARDER it gets AND you get locked out of cool shit
[4:38:22] <secret_npc> wtf no ignore all this doesn't matter
[4:38:23] <%legendfather_of_giants> killing Phalanx adds 1 tendency to all worlds, so theyre all the same rn @PeachSaliva
[4:38:26] <yukichocomilk> they look exactly the same
[4:38:26] <Zombrocom> Ho boy tendancy
[4:38:27] <%JenovasPuppet> You do not see that! Shut up!
[4:38:28] <%ChestMimik> Not to be confused with Battle Tendency
[4:38:32] <Arweynn> crazy talk 1-1 gives white tendancy to all worlds
[4:38:41] <KingKZ> Will this be on the test?
[4:38:48] <splicerss> your slightly whiter than the others
[4:38:50] <AMajorTom> Don't pay too much attention, just let him talk
[4:38:50] <%mastermindgoblin> also, 100% completion requires getting certain zones to both Pure Black AND Pure White

[4:39:19] <%JenovasPuppet> It's South Park's difficulty mode: Black is harder.
[4:39:22] <Dragon_Batman> Do good things it go white, do evil it go black
[4:39:32] <pretendofriendo> is the explained at all ingame?
[4:39:32] <%Tenchi_G> atpCarl Black huh!?
[4:39:35] <AMajorTom> 20 minutes, Central gang
[4:39:38] <%mastermindgoblin> the sheer fact that doing badly makes the game harder alone is ass backwards nonsense

[4:39:54] <%ChestMimik> This seems backwards of what it should be
[4:39:55] <KellBeII> less souls pat
[4:39:57] <brachydios777> what idiot thought this was a good idea?
[4:39:59] <+forebringer> Less damage and less souls
[4:40:04] <+Emperor_Z> I hate that you don't even meet a lot of NPCs if you're not at pure white
[4:40:04] <Zombrocom> So the better you do, the easier the game gets. The worse you do, the harder the game gets. Because... that makes sense.
[4:40:06] <%Tenchi_G> atpCarl Pure white huh!?
[4:40:13] <%ChestMimik> Do you NEED more healing items on white?
[4:40:13] <+kurejichi> not true pat, as usual
[4:40:14] <%legendfather_of_giants> there are also MORE ENEMIES
[4:40:14] <%mastermindgoblin> imagine if in RE4, if you shoot too much and run low on ammo, the AI director decided to give you LESS ammo
[4:40:18] <Dragon_Batman> Yea great things happen in pure white
[4:40:19] <splicerss> the PUREST
[4:40:22] <$SvenHolgersson> psaCrazyhand psaCrazyhead
[4:40:25] <KellBeII> also wrong, black tendency gives both more items and souls
[4:40:27] <yukichocomilk> stupidest system ever
[4:40:29] <%DianaTheAscian> It's a terrible system
[4:40:31] <$DensityD> and those silly pebbles for the secret armor
[4:40:31] <tux_3do> "i dont understand what youre talking about man, fromsoft games are completely intuitive and not obtuse"
[4:40:31] <+RandyFistburgers> it's basically a bunch of bullshit
[4:40:32] <AMajorTom> Do exactly bad enough
[4:40:36] <%legendfather_of_giants> @KellBeII healing items you get more in White
[4:40:40] <%superc37> its such a stupid system
[4:40:41] <mr_saturday93> sounds like black tend is better because of the materials
[4:40:43] <+Fetrigon> sipsipElmo_SG
[4:40:48] <%Arek_1> The fun way is to go through X-1, X-2, and X-3 in pure black world tendency. Then go pure white world tendency.
[4:40:49] <Dragon_Batman> Kill an NPC too I think
[4:40:54] <Hydrapissed> waabyuGun
[4:40:57] <%Tenchi_G> majinoElmo Pure black!

[4:41:49] <pretendofriendo> SHES RIGHT! ITS WAY DUMB!
[4:41:50] <$SvenHolgersson> @PeachSaliva There is also some questlines that can ONLY be completed in White and Black world tendencies

[4:42:33] <+Whiskey_T_Foxtrot> LTG's advice was prescient
[4:42:33] <$SvenHolgersson> IT IS LITERALLY THE BEST VERSION OF THE GAME
[4:42:39] <%mastermindgoblin> but also you won't ever get to see a lot of the cool fights against black phantoms
[4:42:39] <%Arek_1> On certain holidays, the global average was set to pure white or black, as well.
[4:42:41] <%legendfather_of_giants> NO EXPLANATION AT ALL IN GAME

[4:43:04] <+MidnightBurst12> what the acutal fuck
[4:43:05] <SivSarcast> So Black Friday is just pure black?
[4:43:06] <+Emperor_Z> It's one of the most bizarre, obscure, aimlessly-designed systems in video game history
[4:43:06] <%legendfather_of_giants> not even a tutorial message
[4:43:09] <KellBeII> youre kind of overstating it, you get some extra content from it but its not exactly like youre getting hidden bosses from it or anything
[4:43:16] <%Keyd00d> You can beat the game without caring
[4:43:18] <%mastermindgoblin> Being drunk might actually make it make more sense

[4:43:45] <Dragon_Batman> There are really neat people that show up too

[4:46:19] <RushUnplugged> "didn't age well" it's just turn based
[4:46:19] <%Sotetsu> Paige, you've been streaming all year. You deserve a break.
[4:46:20] <Dunmarkh> Garnt
[4:46:26] <@SoFarFetched> Vivi is cute though

[4:46:29] <%TheWinged7> @PeachSaliva yall missed my sub message at the start of the stream, did it just vanish?

[4:46:33] <Hydrapissed> waabyuPat
[4:46:39] <oda_flobunaga> FF8's combat is way worse
[4:46:40] <+cvp5127> post more vore
[4:46:42] <mr_saturday93> heard ff9 story is good
[4:46:42] <thunderborn32> but the music!
[4:46:46] <%AncelDeLambert> the combat is one of the main reasons I gave up my recent replay of it halfway through
[4:46:48] <%mastermindgoblin> I think you might have missed mine too
[4:46:49] <AMajorTom> Choosing things off a menu is old school gameplay
[4:47:00] <%mastermindgoblin> You got a chunk of my bet from earlier
[4:47:01] <@SoFarFetched> it either  vanished or she forgot to click
[4:47:02] <worldbrand> ff9 can have some weird balance issues if you're not on top of learning all abilities
[4:47:02] <@SoFarFetched> geefBlank
[4:47:07] <%Kay_Tana> You missed me too
[4:47:07] <%FacetiousAF> @cvp5127 begone thot
[4:47:10] <%Keyd00d> Turn based is baesd
[4:47:15] <%TheWinged7> all good, just wanted to make sure
[4:47:15] <%ChestMimik> 2022 vision
[4:47:18] <Dragon_Batman> Yea of vision
[4:47:24] <RushUnplugged> it's turn BASED not turn CRINGE
[4:47:30] <%mastermindgoblin> "Only about a year and a half"
[4:47:30] <%DianaTheAscian> Paige.
[4:47:30] <%CatastropheCorvid> "only"

[4:47:35] <%Keyd00d> LUL
[4:47:35] <%legendfather_of_giants> Paieg catacombs was 3 years ago
[4:47:35] <thunderborn32> A YEAR AND A HALF?
[4:47:37] <OldOnyx> "only"
[4:47:40] <%JenovasPuppet> That's not better!
[4:47:41] <hoagie_in_disguise> Paige has been blind for "only" a year and a half.
[4:47:42] <oda_flobunaga> JESUS CHRIST
[4:47:42] <AMajorTom> I've only needed glasses that I don't have for my thirties.
[4:47:49] <%Catpurnicus> wait, how do you drive
[4:47:51] <jetpack_rorschasch> Paige, you've lied about getting glasses for a long fucking time. It's time to actually do it.
[4:47:58] <%luckypineapple> luckypineapple subscribed with Prime. They've subscribed for 3 months! The story and the characters of FF9 are great. Also I think that FFX is one of those games that has suffered from the memes it made, because the game is so fucking good. Weird they never brought Wakka's Grand Wizard class back
[4:48:06] <%Ranryu692> Demon's Souls is my favorite of the Soulsborne games
[4:48:09] <$BepBepAmShep> Guys, it's "only" been a year and a half coxKappa No big deal then.
[4:48:12] <RetroCop87> HORK B'JORK

[4:48:32] <Oscarthemowerman> kill the meters? 🤔
[4:48:38] <%StephanieSadGirl> What the fuck is with you canadians and europeans and everyone elseians and wanting to kill meters?  What did htey ever do to you?
[4:48:40] <+Deekman> 10 min until New Years in Manitoba! Happy new year guys!!
[4:48:40] <%JenovasPuppet> Ooof
[4:48:41] <%AncelDeLambert> really?
[4:48:45] <%AncelDeLambert> ten is still decent
[4:48:46] <TheFrontRowJoe> average dark souls series fan vs. average demon's souls enjoyer
[4:48:49] <%VashyronM> Tidus ruins that game
[4:48:51] <%RayReborne> eyyy, blitzball
[4:48:52] <%Arek_1> csbeastBleetz
[4:48:53] <%DianaTheAscian> The memes helped X for me
[4:48:53] <@SoFarFetched> X is in a weird spot I feel
[4:48:55] <RetroCop87> FFX is just a more boring FFXIII
[4:48:55] <Dragon_Batman> Game is good, also very linear for a while. still good
[4:48:57] <%mastermindgoblin> *Tidus laughing noises*
[4:48:59] <%Agami23> tidus is more interesting in dissidia
[4:49:00] <%Sotetsu> I love 10. ❤️ Second favorite after 6.
[4:49:00] <%Keyd00d> X is pretty cool
[4:49:01] <+Taisuru> How about X-2 :V
[4:49:02] <%JenovasPuppet> Paige the vore was one thing, but now you've crossed a line!
[4:49:03] <+realm_forge> HA HA HA HA HAAAAA
[4:49:05] <+cvp5127> but lulu
[4:49:06] <%superc37> whats wrong paige, you dont like grnd wiard waka?
[4:49:06] <%luckypineapple> Rikku is best girl.
[4:49:06] <%NigelSchnauzerpug> The story is so bad that it ruins any aspects of the gameplay for me. I just can't look past it.
[4:49:07] <+RenoDeGeneric> How is Lulu only KINDA cool?
[4:49:07] <thunderborn32> YES riku best girl
[4:49:09] <oda_flobunaga> 10-2 is awful with great gameplay
[4:49:10] <%AncelDeLambert> the worst that ten gets is still not enough to sink it, somehow
[4:49:11] <RushUnplugged> Paige confirmed evil
[4:49:13] <%mastermindgoblin> Tidus is a really annoying protag
[4:49:14] <%RealThiele> booba
[4:49:16] <%ChestMimik> lol
[4:49:17] <%cobalt_phoenix_> that's good
[4:49:17] <+RandyFistburgers> ok bye
[4:49:18] <%supersparta12345> I think my message got skipped
[4:49:19] <%DianaTheAscian> LUL LUL LUL
[4:49:20] <%Bt_Robot> If they are within 15km, they are most certainly within 15mi.
[4:49:21] <+ReallyBigRocks> :O
[4:49:24] <KingKZ> X? You mean that Blitzball game with that fantasy side quest?
[4:49:24] <%Ranryu692> Paige won't, because she can
[4:49:26] <+talfurt> tidus isn't even close to being as bad as people make hims seem
[4:49:26] <%Ranryu692> t see
[4:49:29] <%AncelDeLambert> 10-2 is suck that is still fun
[4:49:30] <%g0atmeal> thanks for the stream!
[4:49:32] <%AncelDeLambert> it's suck-fun
[4:49:32] <%Sotetsu> Air Bud is a cheater
[4:49:33] <%VashyronM> @cvp5127 if she was the main character, best game
[4:49:33] <%Keyd00d> Tidus is fine
[4:49:35] <AMajorTom> There's no rule saying that dogs can't play
[4:49:37] <KCfusecoast> So whats your thoughts on PS5 so far when compared to PC and the news that 2022 will be a longer period of PS5 shortages vs Xbox Series X?
[4:49:37] <+barrakuta371> ok bye. and also happy new year
[4:49:44] <Coystick> Did Paige just glitch out irl?
[4:49:47] <%Sotetsu> Nice jug

[4:49:48] <T_Sasquatch> what the fuck i have that exact bottle
[4:49:48] <FunkyStreams> thats not good
[4:49:49] <+mayoRAMM> mayoRAMM subscribed with Prime. 
[4:49:51] <+RandyFistburgers> chugalug
[4:49:52] <CrypticMochi> I heard the english version had bad VA directions especially for Yuna
[4:49:52] <%ChestMimik> Law of averages
[4:49:56] <Admiral_PopnFresh> LUL
[4:49:57] <a_mad_dragon_> fill that with THICK WATER and drink the whole thing SoonerLater
[4:49:57] <Dragon_Batman> That's not great LUL
[4:49:57] <%RealThiele> big piss
[4:49:58] <%Keyd00d> woah hype
[4:49:59] <tanarath> It is
[4:50:01] <BisoromiBear> top off your meter right before it runs out, what's the problem?
[4:50:03] <+AgniBrandt> That's still bad
[4:50:03] <TheStrongBanana> hundred percent it's what she does
[4:50:04] <$BepBepAmShep> That's some night peeing, right there
[4:50:05] <SGrim> FRY THAT CHICKEN
[4:50:06] <+BelricPsytar> Stop doing that
[4:50:07] <square__1> Chug Queen
[4:50:07] <@SoFarFetched> "water tastes better when you need to go to bed"
[4:50:07] <SinnerEbru> pat, its called girlbossing
[4:50:08] <KCfusecoast> What time do you start drinking the champaigne?
[4:50:11] <%mastermindgoblin> Paige is using the water trick to make sure she gets up early, just like the native americans, or Bart
[4:50:13] <+realm_forge> SO MUCH BETTER
[4:50:14] <AMajorTom> Waking up to pee is based
[4:50:16] <KingKZ> TMI
[4:50:16] <%VashyronM> ...what?
[4:50:18] <%doomunderthestairs> damn this is too real
[4:50:20] <Profmcstevie> Porcelain destroyer
[4:50:21] <@SoFarFetched> more like girlpissing
[4:50:21] <FunkyStreams> @ChestMimik gotta min max that hydration
[4:50:22] <@SoFarFetched> geefPlz
[4:50:23] <%walternatorz> isn't that exactly what pat described?
[4:50:23] <hoagie_in_disguise> Welp.
[4:50:23] <+RandyFistburgers> load them kidneys to the max
[4:50:24] <%Sotetsu> That would make me get up, like, 4 times during the night
[4:50:26] <%HeadAsianInCharge> that's so much better.....
[4:50:27] <%Keyd00d> fried piss
[4:50:29] <%ChestMimik> Pat gatekeeping hydration strats
[4:50:30] <chan_chan_revolution> Hey guys what's going o-
[4:50:33] <anoddish1> You're an inspiration to us all
[4:50:34] <%RayReborne> fried piss
[4:50:35] <+MidnightBurst12> real power
[4:50:36] <%Ranryu692> this fried chicken piss noise is making me uncomfortable
[4:50:37] <%mastermindgoblin> I can't talk, I'm making PISS
[4:50:37] <+AgniBrandt> Paige no
[4:50:44] <%Sotetsu> Like Noah parting the red sea.
[4:50:51] <jetpack_rorschasch> You're supposed to drink it through the day Paige. You don't get any benefits if you just down it in an hour.
[4:50:53] <+realm_forge> It’s called Paige forgets to drink water
[4:50:54] <%JenovasPuppet> It's so much the original
[4:50:54] <%EyeFarted> SOUNDS LIKE A DOZEN RATS IN A KFC DEEP FRYER
[4:51:07] <%Keyd00d> and some terrible redesigns
[4:51:08] <+Jack8274> They literally made the old engine and worked over that
[4:51:09] <%greasypete00> its a litle less janky too
[4:51:10] <Dragon_Batman> I think they touched up animations for some things
[4:51:14] <+RandyFistburgers> It's pretty smooth still considering
[4:51:18] <%superc37> ALSO it has shittier music and art direction
[4:51:24] <%Sotetsu> I was playing along with you on the PS3 version. sipsipDab
[4:51:29] <%luckypineapple> Dark Souls is also agonizingly slow
[4:51:33] <%AncelDeLambert> DS2 is fucking BRICK in your ass
[4:51:41] <%legendfather_of_giants> 3 is super fast too
[4:51:42] <%luckypineapple> Dark Souls 2 and 3 are much faster than Dark Souls 1
[4:51:49] <AMajorTom> 7 minutes Central gang
[4:51:53] <+Jack8274> Even the heavy weapons are fast start ups
[4:51:55] <+RenoDeGeneric> nah this game is fast, it just feels good.
