[0:37:49] <%ThomasOfTroy> ThomasOfTroy subscribed with Twitch Prime. They've subscribed for 17 months! Thanks to you and Eli talking about Korone's yubi yubi videos, I got curious and fell into the vtuber hole! Korone's cute, but the rest of them are utter degenerates and I hold you two responsible for making me yet stray further from god's glorious light

I’ve been a hidden DLC in the chats for the last several months because I’ve doing three things. Work, helping get friends find scarce new Switches for cheap, and starting taking meds to help ease my anxiety so I can finally start uploading my content I been building for a long time. Not letting 2020 be full shit year. Wish me luck and have fun, Queencess Peach!

[1:49:05] <@Jekado> because people don't like yellow as a color i guess
[1:49:06] <Mister_McDerp> yellow is the color of piss
[1:49:07] <+neutralraff> who needs DC fandom when we got this.

[1:49:49] <+Engwithan_Elder_God> Just made it by fucking blue
[1:49:51] <$Polarix64> Yellow loses a lot because most of the time randoms are paired on Yellow while teams are paired on red and blue

[1:50:00] <+Shubreaker> BLUE LIVES DON'T MATTER
[1:50:01] <terminusterminal> Instead of putting the points in yellow they took the points out of blue

[2:12:50] <DavidSanChan> jump n dive towards incline
[2:12:54] <+RealThiele> chicken noises
[2:12:59] <+angel949> Dive towards the top part when its at an angle
[2:13:01] <%Kenzo2000> @GJIPE to cheer themselves up
[2:13:03] <Sunstalker> DavidSanChan Diving will kill you
[2:13:04] <%Roasted_Pheasant> Honestly this music just makes me think of splatoon every time

[2:13:26] <SomeOtherNeb> I still think that people that don't understand See Saw should not be allowed to drive
[2:13:26] <%dekkitout> @GJIPE When things go tits up- it implies dead
[2:13:32] <CriticKitten> Incredible
[2:13:37] <Skatedeandre> I also think of splatoon
[2:13:42] <Admiral_PopnFresh> @gjipe because it's similarly embarrassing when they pop out?
[2:13:45] <+abrupt_abe> Diving is the strat here
[2:13:50] <$SomeNEET> Using the dive to land when you're afraid you're going to break your legs helps a lot
[2:13:51] <+RealThiele> tactical dives are good

[2:49:55] <%a_goth_pancake> Lucio ball
[2:49:55] <$Piemono> Nothing new for Yellow
[2:49:56] <+Kurt_0> Fooseball
[2:49:59] <+Clundy> He came so long and came so far but in the end it doesn’t really matter... is what Paige would say if Pat got a vasectomy
[2:50:00] <@Jekado> yeah it can get pretty unbalanced
[2:50:00] <%Kenzo2000> Yeah, even the game hates Yellow
[2:50:01] <missingangle> Watch them win instead
[2:50:01] <%Starotter70> Fall Ball suc

[2:50:12] <+UrielCobalt> nvm
[2:50:12] <sothatsprettybrutal> yeah it has nothing to stop that or people just quitting if they're down or have less players
[2:50:14] <Xeno351> fall ball's the best
[2:50:14] <Valdorick> Nailed it
[2:50:15] <+ThePayphone> activate crazy talk, yellow W incoming
[2:50:15] <CatmanIX> oh you haven't played fall ball before? always 4v5 that I've seen
[2:50:21] <autcetera> I sweat the devs should make every team see themselves as yellow to stop the crazy stigma
[2:50:21] <$joylent_blue> yellow self scoring
[2:50:21] <Valdorick> Pats dick is so big
[2:50:23] <$NitronStreams> Rip yellow already dead

[3:11:41] <@SoFarFetched> It's paige's mouth and she can put whatever she wants in her mouth
[3:11:42] <+FlameLoneWolf> You didn't even do it intentionally.
[3:11:42] <@Jekado> "you gonna finish that mold"
[3:11:43] <%g0atmeal> i called dibs on the mold
[3:11:44] <Valentinius_Anodyne> Why would people do that
[3:11:47] <%miabyte> Paige is really covering new ground with COVID research. You could say she really broke the mold in that field.
[3:11:51] <SirKeigan> People still send you messages about that shit?
[3:11:56] <freelancebabymaker> really helping the perception of the female species.....
[3:12:00] <Oxybe> Paige ate the peniscillin

I know my sub message did but I was just gonna let it go. but someone else said theirs got missed too so I just thought I'd say something. sorry to be a bother. Anyway all I said was I'm the guy who has been commenting on your vods and said I have a cat named gizmo and I thought we were long lost siblings lol. also I'm working on something for you guys. its gonna take time but itll be worth it.
[3:31:25] <KingKrampus> and yes I used 600 points to highlight that, and it was worth it to put that image in y'all's minds
[3:31:28] <rytisone> I know now why you cry
