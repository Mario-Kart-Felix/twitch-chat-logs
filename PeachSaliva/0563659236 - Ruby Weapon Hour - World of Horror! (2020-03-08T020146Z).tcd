[0:20:01] <SovPho> Imagine how cheated you would feel if you found out one of the 13 herbs and spices was bay leaf.
[0:20:02] <%juxtest> The real world of horror is the Pats we nearly killed along the way
[0:20:02] <TomFrank> yea arent you supposed to take bay leaves out of food?
[0:20:02] <$wolfofsound> @PeachSaliva don't worry, his body tries to kill him every night
[0:20:02] <am_omega> Did Pat shit and or vomit the chili?
[0:20:03] <+Micalica> What a start!

[0:20:15] <%sharpington_> The house will clearly go to ELMO
[0:20:15] <$wolfofsound> ONE LEAF
[0:20:15] <Neo_Kaiser> If Pat dies Paige will have to stream with Adam.
[0:20:16] <awalr> elmo can have a little bay leaf, as a threat
[0:20:16] <%DesuDesuDokiDoki> fishy fishy~
[0:20:17] <sadiebubs> She is currently getting vidoe footage for her alaby
[0:20:17] <+the_mental_punk> That was only the first boss for the chili
[0:20:18] <%D00msDayDan> how ironic that a canadian would be done in by a leaf
[0:20:18] <%Dragon_Batman> It always is
[0:20:18] <+linSP> Can I get the house thanks :)
[0:20:19] <+arancet> whys there a bay leaf in chili?

[0:20:25] <%Conyst> make sure to check the rest of the chili for more bay leafs
[0:20:26] <+Thomzzz> wait the bay leaf wasnt a joke
[0:20:26] <+captain_tsoon> If pat dies we gotta bury him in the woolie hole
[0:20:27] <%TheWinged7> Paige you did nothing wrong, Pat should chew his food properly like an adult
[0:20:27] <+soundcloud_raptor> this game so good
[0:20:28] <shaggycactus> always remove them hahaha
[0:20:28] <DamnGoodCake> all good, honest mistake

[0:20:29] <zal_silverfang> @PeachSaliva but paige, thisis a start to the stream that we all expect
[0:20:29] <%EyeFarted> @PeachSaliva Paige, The Murderous Chef
[0:20:29] <ShineTheDiamond> THERE ARE MORE BAYLEAVES IN THERE?
[0:20:29] <%Dementedpenguin> The Woolie/Paige podcast is gonna be sick
[0:20:29] <%hntronium> indirect assassination
[0:20:30] <Skatedeandre> Why do you feel bad?
[0:20:30] <Hellarussian> yeah it was "incidental"
[0:20:30] <%king_wragles> It's not healthy to eat uncooked bayleaves, but you'll be fine. It's the RAW bayleaf that's the big, BIG problem
[0:20:30] <YakumoYomi> One Guy = One Leaf
[0:20:31] <xeros720> hindsight is 20/20
[0:20:32] <%D3rrtyD4n> for flava

[0:20:34] <3Xgilly> @PeachSaliva I bought a get smoked hat at PaxEast!!!!!

[0:20:35] <cureneckbeard> psa1guy
[0:20:36] <xeros720> and it's pat, so you know his luck
[0:20:37] <%DesuDesuDokiDoki> UWU
[0:20:37] <Valentinius_Anodyne> Bay Leaf is good
[0:20:37] <+NiceWizard> Bay leaves go in everything you cowards.
[0:20:37] <worldbrand> pat's not even a vvymyn
[0:20:37] <%GabeSweetMan> It adds flavor!
[0:20:37] <KaiserMario> "accidental murder"
[0:20:37] <+CJett92> Its manslaughter if it was an accident
[0:20:37] <+tentaclecosplayer> canada leaf!
[0:20:38] <redrins> eat the leaf
[0:20:38] <%BaronVonMagpie> cooking is just a nightmare for everyone. i ruined a bunch of potatoes earlier because the recipe was fucked up
[0:20:39] <yourliteraldog> Its a good spice
[0:20:40] <+arancet> weird, never seen that in a chili recipe
[0:20:41] <+Your_heals> wtf do bay leaves actually do? real talk
[0:20:41] <RyuuAoi> Pat COULD chew his food.
[0:20:41] <$ImasukyLomae> That's a good defense, just keep saying it It was an accident
[0:20:41] <foreverN2dust> as a treat
[0:20:44] <derekwst3> @PeachSaliva calm down, you didn't kill him
[0:20:44] <maxpasta> Use bigger leaves easier to find
[0:20:46] <%DesuDesuDokiDoki> OwO
[0:20:46] <+machshop> bay leaf helps you not fart so much from the beans
[0:20:50] <%zeif00> So much chili lately
[0:20:53] <+chiluzza> does pat eat like a duck?
[0:20:53] <sadiebubs> more like a recipe for distaster!
[0:20:54] <%chronoxgp> sipsipElmo_SG Guess I'm sleeping... out tonight
[0:20:55] <TomFrank> YET
[0:20:55] <%DesuDesuDokiDoki> yet
[0:20:55] <enby_shout> F
[0:20:56] <%spiritofmojave> TRU
[0:20:57] <%D3rrtyD4n> LOL
[0:20:57] <Skatedeandre> It’s not like you intentionally wanted the leaf to get stuck
[0:20:57] <@SSaryn> PAT DED
[0:20:58] <%ShichiNoBushi> A whole pokémon Bayleaf.
[0:20:58] <xeros720> a "little bit" of mustard
[0:21:00] <SovPho> @yourliteraldog it's an herb, not a spice
[0:21:00] <BoomerUnchained> Whuu?
[0:21:01] <%KingKZ> Pat needs to put points in his leaf resistance stat.
[0:21:01] <%jobbedbone> peach accidentally used the "kill women" recipe
[0:21:02] <+TheNegligibleOne> what is wrong with those pants
[0:21:03] <Admiral_PopnFresh> 1 Bay leaf is the equivalent of like 3 tablespoons of Oregano
[0:21:04] <$StaceMcGate> Peach "Manslaughter" Saliva
[0:21:04] <OwlLightningMage> We must not forget that Paige is actually a Russian spy
[0:21:04] <sadiebubs> Pat is dead confirmed
[0:21:05] <Aracon_> he might die later who knows
[0:21:05] <@PlagueOfGripes> bay leaves are a spice. you are not meant to devour them. they're like chewing through a sheet of plastic
[0:21:07] <Valentinius_Anodyne> It's only a little death, as a treat
[0:21:08] <Reanimator83> Tell Pat playing RE6 will make him feel better
[0:21:08] <Drusain> but we're chat, it's funny to overreach
[0:21:08] <%Dragon_Batman> When you hear.... dasoifnaoifnaoifhna;lfknj you kinda worry
[0:21:09] <RyuuAoi> You look good tonight @peachsaliva <3
[0:21:09] <+the_mental_punk> WHy is there chili on my bay Leaf
[0:21:09] <Darkrenai> I cant believe peach killed pat live on stream
[0:21:10] <%zamatermort> Paige, our job is to over react
[0:21:11] <ECRead> i obey cooking rules, not recipes
[0:21:12] <Jack_of_No_Trades> Your attempt failed, be relieved
[0:21:14] <+Dektoide> I can't believe Pat died
[0:21:14] <enby_shout> yeah but we typed F so he's dead
[0:21:16] <Neo_Kaiser> I knew it, Paige only dated Pat for his money and fame!
[0:21:19] <Sol_Install> pat uncomfortable?
[0:21:23] <%Kenzo2000> Boy are they
[0:21:23] <+TheNegligibleOne> I love them but they're terrible terrible pants
[0:21:24] <Skatedeandre> He did need assistance though
[0:21:25] <$wolfofsound> I bet he did
[0:21:25] <%Conyst> choking is very serious Paige
[0:21:26] <CrimsonCore90> yeah he did
[0:21:27] <SovPho> gosh diggity dog dang darnit they aren't a spice
[0:21:27] <%TheWinged7> Paige has a very Australian attitude, "shell be right mate"
[0:21:28] <@PlagueOfGripes> Its Pat
[0:21:29] <$StaceMcGate> so you didn't cut it enough?
[0:21:30] <Katorskay> So basically Pat is stupid
[0:21:31] <Dhurkst> PHRASING
[0:21:32] <valriot> LUL
[0:21:33] <%hntronium> big like paige's dick?
[0:21:34] <+machshop> he wasn't chewin his dang food
[0:21:34] <CptVolkow> Fuck it
[0:21:35] <awalr> he can't taste so he didn't see
[0:21:35] <Neo_Kaiser> She'll be apples
[0:21:36] <BoomerUnchained> Paige you have to finish RE6 if Pat passes
[0:21:36] <%Naotox10> its the curse
[0:21:36] <RantingRavager> Is Pat a Kirby and he just inhales the food?
[0:21:37] <CptVolkow> Leave the leaf in
[0:21:37] <+garbocardboardington> You tell her @PlagueOfGripes
[0:21:37] <peachy996> What's important is that Bayleef is the wors pokemon
[0:21:37] <%zamatermort> Because Pat eats like he is Kirby
[0:21:39] <Meekest> I didnt know you werent supposed to eat the bay leaf
[0:21:39] <+michingmallecho> it’s big enough
[0:21:40] <Djinnazz> So Pat is dumb.
[0:21:40] <%Typhaeon> Typhaeon subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 22 months! Pat should be on SNL Kappa
[0:21:41] <Mister_McDerp> pat swallows his food whole
[0:21:41] <Hellarussian> you're supposed to be his caretaker
[0:21:41] <+michingmallecho> psaSmug
[0:21:41] <+Solutha> Pat doesnt know what a bay leaf is
[0:21:41] <yourliteraldog> @SovPho Seasoning
[0:21:42] <+CptBritches> No, it really is Pat's
[0:21:43] <%DesuDesuDokiDoki> F
[0:21:43] <+SWFanatic> its fine
[0:21:43] <%chronoxgp> sipsipElmo_SG Impressive
[0:21:44] <Jack_of_No_Trades> Dont feel bad, it was good tv
[0:21:45] <Birdigalore> ANYWAY
[0:21:45] <%GabeSweetMan> Pat cannot be trusted to BREATH woman.
[0:21:45] <cureneckbeard> It's not like I'm worried about Pat or anything... I just want to get my money's worth from my sub, that's all! nyannTsun HMMPH! nyannTsun

[1:06:27] <TurtlesAndTentacles> Seinfield sucks and so does Jerry
[1:06:28] <%BioStormX> That's because Larry David is WAYYY funnier than Jerry Seinfeld
[1:06:29] <Alseid> Tom Papa is good and wholesome
[1:06:29] <$joylent_blue> mulaney's great
[1:06:29] <OwlLightningMage> Chapelle show was legendary
[1:06:29] <peachy996> S3 was hit or miss
[1:06:30] <$konekoryugamine> He's right though
[1:06:33] <smargh1015> Jerry is full boomer
[1:06:34] <JorgenTheElf> Carlin was a comrade
[1:06:38] <+MisterTylerrr> Mitch fucking Hedberg

[1:06:40] <shockmaster3> Chappelle is still good but not as strong as he used to be i feel
[1:06:40] <sadolerlaqreet1> Chappell vs key or peel

[1:25:04] <%sadiebubs> Hey, Paige. Since we are giving life advice I thought I'd ask if you have had experience with artistic burn out. I am a music major and really hoping to do it for a career, because it is my passion. Pretty often feel very discouraged when I feel like I don't practice enough, and I personally feel that video games are getting in my way. Do you have any tips for making significant life and habit changes for long term growth?

[3:29:21] <%GabeSweetMan> Not elder gods tho
[3:29:23] <gamezerox> No one is prepared for a KATANA
[3:29:25] <hamster_eater> she cant be stopped
[3:29:27] <Valdorick> They can be defeated! They can be!
[3:29:31] <%sharpington_> Is ending A always the best ending?
[3:29:33] <Brother_Coduss> so, toilet paper demons count as "ancient horrors" huh?
[3:29:35] <%Skelegroove> If all you needed was a sword then ancient evils are pretty weak
[3:29:36] <+logoth_> Wont you need to cure your brain damage eventually?
[3:29:37] <%MaddyCaddy> So from the story, if you take red, you get stabbed until you're covered in your own blood and if you take blue, you get strangled until you turn blue.
[3:29:38] <Zombrocom> Old gods have nothing on the power of SWORD
[3:29:40] <%ha2ken> Katana is holiest of swords
[3:29:40] <%GabeSweetMan> Do the riots ALWAYS happen at some point?
[3:29:42] <Djinnazz> BAD TOUCH
[3:29:43] <heartlesshealer> no threat management now
[3:29:43] <lloyddboy> TRUST ONLY YOUR FISTS
[3:29:44] <%GabeSweetMan> It feels like it.
[3:29:45] <Mige_> ancient evils are easily defeated with a katana
[3:29:46] <%MaddyCaddy> I have no idea what the lesson of the story is
[3:29:56] <UnfilteredComic> @PeachSaliva If you do the other ending, he drops his mask and you can equip it. Some endings give different rewards for harder fights

[4:25:27] <+cereal_box_conspiracy> why would you ask Paige for advice? Talk to a doctor, wtf.
[4:25:31] <heartlesshealer> brain things usually go unnoticed, so it's good they caught it
[4:25:43] <worldbrand> Like you! That's right, the person reading this!
[4:25:49] <%sadiebubs> Does Paige always read subs at the beginning of the stream?

[4:27:14] <%Kirby_Sauce> i am the conductor of the poop train
[4:27:15] <%GeneralSCPatton> Always better to get treatment before the tumor consumes your entire mind and erases your sense of self
[4:27:16] <Jathspuh> Libido
[4:27:16] <%tacostarvedbeast> @Kirby_Sauce too good a shot, my dodging was not up to snuff
[4:27:20] <heartlesshealer> WILLPOWER IS REAL
[4:27:22] <StalwartZephyr> Constitution
[4:27:25] <Valentinius_Anodyne> It increases your max Reason
[4:27:25] <xUmbraNinja> psa1guy
[4:27:26] <Coystick> My Dad's doing that going through chemo, positive thinking is a genuine medical assest
[4:27:28] <OkamiDude15> it increases your midichlorians
[4:27:33] <+SWFanatic> placebos work
[4:27:41] <%D00msDayDan> mind over matter
[4:27:42] <worldbrand> stress really matters
[4:27:46] <trustycoyote> The fact that you are getting surgery is a very good sign. They wouldn't do surgery if there is no hope. They would have gone the chemo route to give you a little more time.
[4:27:46] <%Grandma_Amari> Oh hey I was just watching the vod of Pat playing this game! What a neat 'lil roguelike
[4:27:50] <$Tredecian> gives you a vitality buff
[4:27:54] <%Kirby_Sauce> @tacostarvedbeast i'm sorry, what?
[4:27:55] <SpaceGuntank> the power of the HUMAN SOUL
[4:27:55] <Neo_Kaiser> I'm depressed and gonna die soon
[4:27:57] <StromkoPenguin> And make sure nobody's praying for you, because that actually makes it worse.
[4:28:04] <%depressed_skeleton> but..*i'm* depressed...
[4:28:06] <+Pyroclase> He waited until he was 70 just to do that?
[4:28:15] <%Kirby_Sauce> @tacostarvedbeast *are you playing crucible?*
[4:28:15] <%MaddyCaddy> Placebo you brain into surviving longer.
[4:28:16] <%GabeSweetMan> For all the shit that depression isn't a "real" illness, folks who don't have it will not understand how huge a debuff it is for our skill checks.
[4:28:20] <%sadiebubs> I think everyone here is probably depressed to some capacity...
[4:28:23] <zamzoph> OOPS
[4:28:27] <Valdorick> Oopsie doodles!
[4:28:27] <%foreverN2dust> whoop some ass
[4:28:28] <$Agami23> my brother used to basically will himself not to be sick. saying im not getting sick. the one time he didnt do that he got diagnosed with chrones.
[4:28:28] <+griffball13> BIG OOPS
[4:28:30] <%XeroSigmaPrime> Placebo is strong AF, thats why homeopathy, acupuncture, and most chiropractics are still a thing
[4:28:30] <OkamiDude15> increaseing your own social link gives you the big buffs
[4:28:32] <%GeneralSCPatton> +4 Morale Bonus to Fort Saves
[4:28:32] <+Grayhammatter> OOPS

[4:28:48] <+maskedriderhero> prank bro
[4:28:48] <KaliasTV> Placebo is real and it CAN unhurt you
[4:28:49] <+Estuko> I believe in it, you need that energy and positivity to survive. That will WILL SAVE YOU, I needed it badly when my throat was slashed open from the car accident. You can do it! ♥
[4:28:50] <+Carlos_the_Hobo> Got his golden ticket

[4:28:56] <%tacostarvedbeast> @Kirby_Sauce in my experience in most chats when people gift subs people talk about dodging the subs like a kinda game
[4:28:58] <%GabeSweetMan> Depression is like getting a /2 for every skill check roll.
[4:29:01] <YakumoYomi> Psychosomatic
[4:29:04] <+SWFanatic> don't be a victim, enjoy life
[4:29:05] <%JenovasPuppet> Do NOT have a church full of people pray for you!
[4:29:07] <%Bane_Kaikyo> So what you saying is it feels good to not be sick?
[4:29:08] <trustycoyote> Having a good mindset is paramount
[4:29:11] <%sadiebubs> Positive thinking is also like the only way to fix mental health!
[4:29:18] <%sadiebubs> as well as therapy
[4:29:18] <%TheMattman1313> The message is: Everyone who is sick and old and bedridden is lying. Just like Uncle Joe
[4:29:18] <punkthepsychopenguin> Thanks for all the positive vibes, Paige and chat!
