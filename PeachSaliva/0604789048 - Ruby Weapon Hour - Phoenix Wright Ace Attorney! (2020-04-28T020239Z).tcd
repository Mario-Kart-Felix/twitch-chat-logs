[0:09:10] <Prevot> pat better be there to do voices
[0:09:11] <@SoFarFetched> Cheer1000 Been watching your old streams to help pass the time & catch up on shit. Seeing Pat drunk on Hatoful Boyfriend was interesting. But hearing you say, "I will come to you at night & shit in your mouth with my bleached asshole" to Pat during a game of Mario Kart 8 made me think "That's such raw emotion for Paige". It's things like that,that makes me love you two and think "Glad I have a friend like Paige,oh and Pat too he's alright I guess" But seriously love you both (maybe mostly Elmo)

[0:26:48] <%AncelDeLambert> 9 is okay but it pales in every comparison to 7

[0:26:49] <%Fuggins4U> 6 and Below, aka Pat

[0:28:58] <CappuccinoGuil> "Chat will help" OH WE'RE NOT THE ONES TO RELY ON
[0:29:01] <@PlagueOfGripes> You won't get through a chapter
[0:29:02] <Dr_Angelic> There's 5 cases but case 4 and case 5 are practically interconnected story-wise
[0:29:06] <Jetsfantasy> You're maybe going to get only the first one tonight
[0:29:07] <%spiritofmojave> The chapters are LONNNG
[0:29:08] <gstut1> GUILTY!!!
[0:29:10] <+Kataguro> First chapter is really short. You can do the first two tonight probably
[0:29:10] <Garthunox> chapters are super long
[0:29:11] <ShichiNoBushi> 5 episodes. Each is broken into multiple investigation and trial stages.
[0:29:12] <%g0atmeal> A chapter is like a whole stream
[0:29:13] <+OwlLightningMage> I'm not helping you do shit
[0:29:13] <$darcfowler1995> Not the first time he’s Milked it
[0:29:13] <ringabal> Nothing will be wong

[0:29:20] <StencilOST> they are loooong
[0:29:20] <+CelioHogane> NO YOU WON'T
[0:29:22] <Mr_Ease> The first one is pretty short
[0:29:22] <star_feline> Chapter one is the babby chapter
[0:29:23] <+Yakobro> not the first real one
[0:29:23] <MrJazzbo> has Pat played these games?
[0:29:24] <%zamatermort> She will get through the FIRST one and that is it
[0:29:25] <%g0atmeal> First one is short tho
[0:29:25] <+le_master_of_le_swords> Think you will beat the game?
[0:29:25] <+doc_ock_rokc> You literally can't loose chap 1
[0:29:25] <+klassikFrank> Paige, you know this game involves reading, right?
[0:29:27] <+gimmickypizza> They're long
[0:29:27] <Twoiis> First is pretty short... then they get super duper long.
[0:29:28] <%purplehermit12> I dont rememberr the first one being that crazy long
[0:29:29] <%JobberForFTiers> @PlagueOfGripes sipsipRude
[0:29:29] <redlanternreviews> The final chapter is basically half of the game length
[0:29:29] <CappuccinoGuil> @PlagueOfGripes if she gets through the investigation, I'll clap
[0:29:30] <Garthunox> put you glasses on
[0:29:30] <terribleusername> she will get through the prologue
[0:29:35] <%purplehermit12> The later ones sure
[0:29:36] <%XeroSigmaPrime> @Sphincter_Spelunker SHUT UP, HOW ELSE AM I GOING TO GET THE STEAK JUICES
[0:29:38] <Garthunox> nothing will be wrong
[0:29:39] <nemsisturb> well no duh the first one but i think plague means the real case after it
[0:29:39] <amused_platypus> use your deduction skills, if there is a mustard based investigation you should be able to solve it.

[1:15:02] <$Wurmspawn> Paige loves women. Unless there are hot men around, then the women die so they aren't taken up all the thirsty men.

These games at least do it for funsies - the CSI games marketed themselves as requiring logic and careful thought. There are literal correct answers in those games that it deems INCORRECT simply because the devs didn't bother doing their homework.

[2:37:33] <Ahack13> Holy fuck, that would have been so helpful!
[2:37:34] <+OfficerMods> that'll save like a. hour
[2:37:35] <Coystick> Delicious glass

[2:37:42] <+ORGANizerC> just no resolution setting :^)
[2:37:42] <missingangle> Glass her--ait
[2:37:42] <+Wallabri> so much time spent tapping the DS stylus over ever pixel on the screen
[2:37:43] <%CommanderSqueaks> @ralfclogs Is not uterus safe!?
[2:37:45] <Aleate> Maya did it!
[2:37:45] <@CoalSavoie> JUST DON'T EAT THE GLASS, Paige
[2:37:46] <Prevot> oh boy here we go
[2:37:47] <%CommanderSqueaks> **no
[2:37:47] <zamzoph> The murderer! D:
[2:37:48] <deafmutelaughing> a one-sided piece of paper! that only has one side!
[2:37:48] <%Th3SmartAlec> 11037?!
[2:37:49] <+AlchemiBeast> super real evidence
[2:37:50] <jasonisgold79> Oh yeah, the light-hearted game of Ace Attorney where Murder happens like every other month. I mean the game is pretty funny and light-hearted, but it can take itself seriously and can even get sad and pretty dark from time to time.
[2:37:51] <%g0atmeal> Sister is guilty! Kill her!
[2:37:55] <Heyestus> Paige's insatiable lust for female death strikes once again. This time her thirst for clunge destruction has rewritten time to kill someone in a 20 year old game
[2:37:56] <TheAceol> 11037
[2:38:00] <+Jaysky> SISTER IS GUILTY AF
[2:38:01] <deafmutelaughing> definitely nothing else on that paper!
[2:38:03] <Roasted_Pheasant> Rip, tits mcgee
[2:38:05] <Prevot> always with the bloody message

[2:38:08] <ringabal> CHARLIE NO
[2:38:09] <%Th3SmartAlec> @TheAceol WHAT COULD IT MEAN?!!
[2:38:09] <televisedrevolting> Ah fuck it was Leon.
[2:38:12] <$Sphincter_Spelunker> the statue did it! case closed
[2:38:12] <%Breakfast_Megapowers> clearly guilty
[2:38:13] <$Wurmspawn> Irony would be if someone made a "non-lethal" replica of the murder weapon just to have it used to murder someone else.
[2:38:17] <DFireCreations> why did maya not call the police
[2:38:19] <%CommanderSqueaks> And the walls
[2:38:20] <%heartlesshealer> wha bout da body?

[4:25:01] <+lwpabloelenano2hc> 1 more
[4:25:02] <Man_in_the_Red> and then theres the other games
[4:25:03] <%zamatermort> This is the short one
[4:25:03] <+TimberWulfe> DAMN long
[4:25:03] <$NitronStreams> She was hit by. She was struck by... truck.
[4:25:05] <%Breakfast_Megapowers> LONG Trials like mah dick
[4:25:05] <televisedrevolting> 5 for each game!
[4:25:07] <%Aeogard> this is just reading stream
[4:25:09] <grandark_z317> @huntercd anime. also Japan.
[4:25:09] <HitchhikingThrough> THAT #5 THOUGH
[4:25:11] <Prevot> each one is longer than the previous one
[4:25:14] <$correctedsun117> And this is the shortest game
[4:25:16] <+Jaysky> The fifth trial is an absolute length eater
[4:25:16] <$Sphincter_Spelunker> @SoFarFetched one trial every month
[4:25:18] <%Keyd00d> first trial was more like 45 minutes
[4:25:18] <phatmac16> Rest for now
[4:25:19] <+yeknomlive> yeah usually split into 2 explore and 2 court
[4:25:19] <redlanternreviews> I'm fairly certain the final trial is like half of the total game length
[4:25:21] <%lewdskeletor13> Isn’t 5 a DLC case
[4:25:21] <Dragon_Batman> It works for an on the go situation with saving anytime
[4:25:22] <%g0atmeal> I love #5
[4:25:22] <NickHatesSnow> the lastt trial might be 3 streams
[4:25:23] <%SvenHolgersson> Theres one in the second that took FOREVERRRRRR
[4:25:25] <karanoyoukai> consoom food now
[4:25:26] <ShichiNoBushi> This is the first REAL trial.
[4:25:29] <YakumoYomi> Turnabout Goodbye is probably my favorite.
[4:25:30] <deafmutelaughing> I hate it so much
[4:25:32] <%Keyd00d> the one they added for the DS one is kind of too long
[4:25:33] <HitchhikingThrough> NUMBER 5 IS A FUCKING NIGHTMARE
[4:25:34] <+TimberWulfe> LIES!
[4:25:35] <+Pyroclase> really? Interesting
[4:25:35] <rubbishbinge> DLC case at the end of 3rd game
[4:25:36] <+Jaysky> Yep
[4:25:36] <Prevot> nope
[4:25:36] <ringabal> 3D TECHNOLOGY
[4:25:37] <splinter1619> 4d chess trials
[4:25:37] <qsirius> The last trial was an add-on in the DS version
[4:25:37] <televisedrevolting> 5 is always a goddamn winner though, jesus. It's literally always amazing.
[4:25:39] <Drunkengen> Which last trial?
[4:25:39] <Quigsies> Basically
[4:25:40] <+yeknomlive> the ds one or the gba one
[4:25:41] <zamzoph> The first game originally had 4
[4:25:41] <deafmutelaughing> JAR ROTATION
[4:25:42] <HitchhikingThrough> ITS SO FUCKING NUTS
[4:25:43] <%Th3SmartAlec> LUL
[4:25:43] <Brandon__Brando> ya its a good book
[4:25:44] <%g0atmeal> It's so great tho
[4:25:44] <Prevot> the last trial of 3 is the most complicated
[4:25:44] <ninjaguiden> yes
[4:25:44] <%Aeogard> LUL
[4:25:44] <+Jaysky> Likely
[4:25:45] <ExpressNode> Yeah it was rough
[4:25:46] <mattdel92> Real trial time
[4:25:47] <phatmac16> YES
[4:25:47] <%Keyd00d> *DS
[4:25:47] <rubbishbinge> well yeah, add-on
[4:25:48] <@SoFarFetched> "Rise from the ashes" should be the last tirla.
[4:25:50] <@SoFarFetched> tirla*
[4:25:50] <%zamatermort> It was also made specifically for the DS version
[4:25:52] <+Mondeiya> rise from the ashes hype
[4:25:52] <%spiritofmojave> FOR SURE
[4:25:52] <@SoFarFetched> TrIAL*
[4:25:53] <@SoFarFetched> LUL
[4:25:53] <StarkMaximum> Paige, even smart people have problems with the last case
[4:25:53] <ZeeJiggle> Ohhh, that one
[4:25:54] <+TimberWulfe> oh wait, unless it's the Emma Skye
[4:25:54] <deafmutelaughing> it sucks so bad
[4:25:55] <yeeyeyee> it will destroy paige
[4:25:55] <HitchhikingThrough> EVERYONE HAD TROUBLE WITH IT
[4:25:55] <+RevolverOcelot16> @Huntercd Which one Edgeworth or the judge or both? I call for both
[4:25:58] <Sloavon> I never finished it
[4:26:03] <+Ancopro> yup the ;last one is literally like 3 cases in one
[4:26:03] <HitchhikingThrough> its so fucking nuts
[4:26:04] <ManfredA> it's got a bunch of DS bullshit
[4:26:04] <%g0atmeal> It literally makes you blow into the mic
[4:26:05] <%Mr_Ease> in the first game, but this is a trilogy so there are 14 cases
[4:26:05] <+Jaysky> Good
[4:26:06] <%zamatermort> So it used DS tech to be cool
[4:26:06] <+Walopoh> SHADOW PUZZLE TRAIL
[4:26:06] <rubbishbinge> I has DS features

[4:26:09] <$correctedsun117> It's a great series
[4:26:09] <$Sphincter_Spelunker> too much talking 4/10
[4:26:10] <+Deano8817> I actually gave up on it
[4:26:10] <ringabal> SO SMART
[4:26:11] <phatmac16> IT'S GREAT

[4:36:19] <RubberFistFight> @PeachSaliva coronaviruses generally don't confer that much in the way of immunity. Couple of months is the average. For the record, one of the things that causes the common cold is a coronavirus. I believe there's also a gastrointestinal variant. Both of those aren't the same as the current one though, just in the same virus family.

[4:48:50] <@SoFarFetched> But you are a shiny lady
[4:48:51] <derap41> Optimists are anoying
[4:48:52] <peachy996> @Zulrez oh
[4:48:59] <$RetroCop87> YOU WISH YOU WERE OPTIMUS!?
[4:48:59] <Monkeyweed21> Pearl clutcher Karen
[4:49:02] <%spiritofmojave> you present like an optimist :b
[4:49:05] <peachy996> Nobody does the threeboobs anymore
[4:49:08] <$Sphincter_Spelunker> Is that why you don't like Optometrists?
[4:49:11] <@SoFarFetched> Primal instincts
[4:49:12] <%Bane_Kaikyo> I thirst for sexy Snek cuddles
[4:49:12] <Nupinoop296> of course
[4:49:12] <%depressed_skeleton> Nice save
[4:49:13] <ringabal> The positivity hole is fillled with lupus
[4:49:13] <peachy996> When did that go out of style
[4:49:21] <Artista_AF> you're our Shining Bacon
[4:49:21] <%walternatorz> are you pessimistic about your pessimism?
[4:49:29] <BeefyQueefer> about animal dicks
[4:49:32] <YakumoYomi> @Bane_Kaikyo You and me both, brother
[4:49:32] <derap41> ..I don't believe it
[4:49:32] <%spiritofmojave> EXPOSED
[4:49:35] <%Keyd00d> SEXY DOGS
[4:49:35] <Baeltyr> nice
[4:49:36] <LoliKappa> sexy dogs LUL
[4:49:36] <Dragon_Batman> That is weird, just knowing him and his content
[4:49:38] <%ThePuddingDead> it's weird, im terrified of snakes, but...sneks help with that
[4:49:40] <Prevot> plague is optmist about the future of interspecies relationships
[4:49:40] <%spiritofmojave> LUL
[4:49:40] <%ThePuddingDead> it's odd
[4:49:41] <$Sphincter_Spelunker> if you say so
[4:49:45] <%TheOnlyStrayCat> SEXY DOGS
[4:49:45] <leargo> on point
[4:49:48] <$RetroCop87> hoarse but whole
[4:49:49] <%depressed_skeleton> What if Pat is an Alien, Can't prove he isn't.
[4:49:50] <Valdorick> Look at those SEXY Dogs. Look at their hands, look at their fucking human hands.
[4:49:52] <%TheOnlyStrayCat> THAT'S WEIRD.
[4:49:54] <+Axellogic> I can see it
[4:49:54] <%Kirby_Sauce> cheer500 i need paige doing an objection! point pose and pat doing an edgeworth eyebulge w/ hunched back pose for a shitpost pleaseandthankyou
[4:50:01] <+Mekhet09> Did paige finally get that the bellboy was talking about the titties?
[4:50:01] <%spiritofmojave> that is a little jarring
[4:50:09] <BeefyQueefer> Plague is optimistic about his animal crimes, and Paige is worried she'll be jailed for her Skeleton crimes.
[4:50:09] <+Axellogic> He's overly critical because he cares too much!
[4:50:13] <%Ranryu692> you'd have to be an optimist to be that disappointed in things all the time
[4:50:14] <$zyberion626> Plague also gripes
[4:50:18] <Monkeyweed21> and the constant complaining
[4:50:19] <Dragon_Batman> I loved his podcast of Darksouls tho LUL
[4:50:19] <%depressed_skeleton> Make money & send money to pat.
[4:50:20] <%zamatermort> Pat is dead
[4:50:30] <%ThePuddingDead> @BeefyQueefer "Worried?"
[4:50:34] <+JavaManJoJo> Is this the end of the stream or the start?
[4:50:37] <theaterunderground> I'm pessimistic as hell too, but pessimism is its own optimism.
[4:50:38] <Arek_1> You can be optimistic and still be hella crass. LUL
[4:50:39] <NeroInfinite> end
[4:50:41] <$i_am_therydon> end
[4:50:43] <Dragon_Batman> @JavaManJoJo The end

[4:51:05] <Monkeyweed21> Ludvig Forsell LOVES the new podcast Pat
[4:51:10] <Dragon_Batman> They are good voices
[4:51:14] <YakumoYomi> I like that one part of Dark Souls when Plague was describing a boss that just ragdolls the player, and started cackling like a lunatic
[4:51:17] <$RetroCop87> Super SIMP level 3

[4:51:45] <%Ranryu692> *I saw her
[4:51:46] <DesuDesuDokiDoki> Konosuba is fucking great
[4:51:49] <%ssjklyco> It would be less effort to use your shirt
[4:51:50] <BeefyQueefer> There are gas-masks built into bras.
[4:51:51] <%fromnibelheim> the lingerie ones are cute tho
[4:51:55] <%superc37> there was this one I kid saw use their underwear as a mask and I was like why
[4:52:01] <%Breakfast_Megapowers> I just don't breathe when I go to work for 6 hours
[4:52:01] <%chrismij57> Konosuba is THE BEST
[4:52:04] <leargo> creativity
