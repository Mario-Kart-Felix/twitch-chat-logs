[0:50:47] <+nathandiel> ProAna THOTs
[0:50:52] <+Engwithan_Elder_God> Sweet. Came in just in time for game play.
[0:50:53] <+NWR_James> @laserbeaming No. Well...no? No. Mostly. Mostly yes
[0:50:59] <jonathandemel> @PeachSaliva Extra is a trash RPG, do not recommend
[0:50:59] <PrettyThickandStrongDyck> Paige going to do but murder all the womens
[0:51:03] <ShershaAD> @peachsaliva just wanted to ask real quick, since the decades coming to an end, do you and pat have a game of the decade? For me personally it was yakuza 0
[0:51:07] <Roz_Lynd> HI PATRICK!! @angriestpat
[0:51:10] <D3rrtyD4n> spooky sounds
[0:51:11] <%zeroarturia> I would totally go gay for Astolfo
[0:51:16] <Nina96> is fate the biggest anime waifu garbage?
[0:51:16] <Mogel56> I love Fate but Extra's gameplay is so bad. At least the Warrios games are decent
[0:51:17] <Coystick> Did I just hear a crow?
[0:51:23] <valentinostand> Peach cant murder all the Woman in Dark souls 2
[0:51:23] <+mh9s> vieo games
[0:51:23] <%AlatosDiogenes> Caw caw
[0:51:27] <spothydra0> Run the perk "No Mither" its over powered
[0:51:27] <%Meidolaon> EXTRA's gameplay is famously bad yeah
[0:51:27] <3Xgilly> What ever happend to DS2?
[0:51:33] <%TheFilth> hmmmm
[0:51:34] <romanticzomedy> bloodborne
[0:51:34] <jonathandemel> If you're gonna do anything Fate just read a VN
[0:51:39] <%starotter70> Oh jeez
[0:51:41] <Coystick> Dark Souls
[0:51:44] <%Divryne> Dundertale.
[0:51:45] <+FrostMass22> Nothing on these streams happens quicklu
[0:51:55] <Coystick> As cliche as it is, gotta be Dark Souls
[0:51:58] <+Dayube> Probably Dark Souls
[0:51:59] <%Meidolaon> And yet EXTRA and CCC are some of the best in writing
[0:51:59] <+Dingalow> 2010 onwards, idiots
[0:52:01] <%arsonistdaria> DMC2
[0:52:03] <+YabbaTroll> !uptime
[0:52:03] <ShershaAD> no i meant between 2010 and 2020
[0:52:05] <+cvp5127> w101
[0:52:08] <+YabbaTroll> feck
[0:52:14] <+primax104> Paige should say Undertale
[0:52:15] <%Faustgesicht> Witcher 3
[0:52:16] <Nina96> hollow knight, shovel knight, dark souls 1 of those
[0:52:17] <%Zagreus> Paige is a wonderful person for the worst of times <3
[0:52:18] <%Meidolaon> Man EXTRA was a PSP game LUL
[0:52:19] <D3rrtyD4n> 2009
[0:52:21] <+VantomPayne> Dark Souls, Okami for last decade but that one is probably just me
[0:52:21] <$Corporate_Redeemer> KNACK 2, BABBYYY
[0:52:22] <Coystick> 2011
[0:52:23] <+DrFacilier> 2011
[0:52:23] <+trustycoyote> Bloodborne?
[0:52:24] <+Dingalow> 2011
[0:52:27] <smargh1015> BimnY is Best Gaeme
[0:52:27] <Nina96> 2011
[0:52:33] <Coystick> 2 0 1 1 P A T
[0:52:34] <BoneofMalkav> Paige and her love of Papyrus
[0:52:35] <+DesertPenguin> 1924
[0:52:36] <D3rrtyD4n> dark souls
[0:52:38] <%Tyonidus> NOOO AM I TOO LATE?
[0:52:40] <+Dingalow> Dark Souls was 2011 ffs Pat
[0:52:40] <%zeroarturia> I feel that's kind of hard to think about. A Top 10 games of the decade would probably be better.
[0:52:40] <%lewdskeletor13> Undertale is a good pick
[0:52:43] <@PlagueOfGripes> Underblood
[0:52:44] <Dhurkst> same
[0:52:44] <%CommanderSqueaks> Cheer500 Since Twitch mobile is a rancid slut and ate my sub. Feeling super fabulous today: drinking red wine under a canopy, enjoying the three days of rain California gets a year, wearing the fuzziest hoodie that rivals your boots in whoritude and comfort and finishing up watching my favorite streamer (suck it Pat) show why she's the bumble-iest mustard queen.
[0:52:45] <+trustycoyote> Any of those are solid choices
[0:52:47] <ShershaAD> DEMONS SOULS WAS 2009
[0:52:49] <+mh9s> gotsta be Dark Souls
[0:52:50] <artificiallynatural> ONE GUY
[0:52:50] <+BoboDaHobo> nier automatic tomatoes
[0:52:53] <shadytreeofknowledge> shhhhh peach's mind
[0:52:55] <%SoFarFetched> Blood Souls
[0:52:57] <$Varlinator> P A P Y R U S <3 P A I G E
[0:52:58] <laserbeaming> Yeah, Demon Souls was 2009
[0:52:58] <@Calek> @Tyonidus you've missed all the donations, it's game time now
[0:52:59] <%MightyMaxT> Spider-Man PS4 or Dead Space 2
[0:52:59] <romanticzomedy> Underblood's a rad name
[0:53:00] <+Diabetic> Bloodborne
[0:53:01] <D3rrtyD4n> soulslike atpRtsd
[0:53:03] <%AlatosDiogenes> Code Vein kappa

[0:53:04] <Coystick> Dark Souls rewrote my brain
[0:53:05] <%Chichen> 4Head
[0:53:05] <$skizzuto> for me it's either undertale or xenoblade chronicles
[0:53:07] <spawnzie> Hollow Knight
[0:53:09] <VirtuaRailith> my dad's favorite game is Baba Is You
[0:53:09] <@commanderclaw> She must get women killed first
[0:53:10] <Ynkubus18> Warframe for me
[0:53:10] <%Tyonidus> @Calek oh awesome, thanks!
[0:53:11] <VirtuaRailith> he loves it
[0:53:14] <+FrostMass22> Dark Souls also ruined 3rd person action games
[0:53:14] <%SoFarFetched> that's a lot of 6's
[0:53:14] <ShershaAD> but yeah undertale makes total sense considering how much you love it @peachsaliva
[0:53:17] <LoliKappa> S.T.A.L.K.E.R. though
[0:53:20] <rubbishbinge> Arc Rise Fantasia lol

[1:01:53] <$Corporate_Redeemer> Typical Survivor main
[1:02:00] <%Binary_Fireball> I want a game where you collect sweaters
[1:02:07] <Decarcassor> @Peach He is a basic killer that get to collect blood to transform in to a easier version of Hillbillt for a while. Also his perks kinda suck.
[1:02:07] <+Zamorouskiwhich> I think thats the idea... it made stealth killers basically pointless
[1:02:08] <ShershaAD> @peachsaliva quick two questions for pat: Kiryu or majima and how long did it take to beat judgment?
[1:02:08] <+VidyaFranX> You could just learn how to loop : p
[1:02:13] <+atticus11789> Undetectable doesn't affect Spine Chill or Premonition.

[1:08:47] <CurrySauseBandit> If survs aren't dcing, screaming profanities, or leaving immediately out of the match without gg'ing. I haven't done my job. SeemsGood
[1:08:48] <+Diabetic> I'm waiting for Overwatch - Blackwatch Subscriptions
[1:08:51] <%CommanderSqueaks> @arsonistdaria Wait you were in Middle School when this game was out? Fucking kill me.
[1:08:51] <Mrman617> Prestige
[1:08:54] <+FrostMass22> GG is toxic but you know what isn't? China gunning down protestors

[1:08:59] <connos_procrastination> GG EZ in the rocket league chat everytime
[1:08:59] <DuoScratch> Those are how many times they've prestiged that character.
[1:08:59] <xWartedEMSx> The smell of that guys fear made the killer run away.
[1:08:59] <CurrySauseBandit> And yes ggez in like literally everygame is either banter or BM LUL
[1:08:59] <Decarcassor> @PeachSaliva Its the prestige level of the character
[1:09:01] <LeftOverPizza13> dwight bros
[1:09:01] <$realm_forge> REALLY DIG IN THERE PAT
[1:09:04] <LoliKappa> if you just try to be as toxic as possible it cancels out and becomes not toxic
[1:09:04] <%ArtemisM822> That’s the prestige symbol
[1:09:06] <SulfurousAcid> put on charms tho
[1:09:06] <+Dingalow> This is why only losers play Overwatch
[1:09:06] <%SoFarFetched> PRO DICKS
[1:09:10] <%AncelDeLambert> the Dwights being on the same animation loop is WEIRD
[1:09:10] <krymzen5> EZ is such a light burn tho. like it shouldn't bother u
[1:09:10] <%arsonistdaria> no not this game man
[1:09:12] <$Rumbutt> Prestige means nothing tbh
[1:09:12] <jorniev> could paige ever stream disco elysium?
[1:09:14] <@commanderclaw> Or people who need to compensate

[1:09:40] <Tinosruler> ez like your mom is the only sensible answer on gg ez
[1:09:41] <Decarcassor> @PeachSaliva Prestige is compleltly meaningless. It just indicate that the player hass spent a lot of BP for shitty blooding clothes.

[1:15:24] <+Walopoh> echo-location by roaring is funny to think about LUL
[1:15:25] <%Sora20030c> It's his power, he can suck them up to charge his power
[1:15:25] <%ArtemisM822> The blood is what the Oni absorbs for his power

[1:23:13] <ace23691> Wholesome Paige
[1:23:13] <studleydoorite> I also type things and then say them quietly to myself
[1:23:15] <%Roasted_Pheasant> I do kinda wish there was proximity voice chat
[1:23:15] <%CantWalkGood> CantWalkGood subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 4 months! Yay! Paige is back! Glad to see Dead By Daylight!
[1:23:16] <krymzen5> wholesome
[1:23:18] <$nademonkey1100> god the noise of that progression bar
[1:23:18] <Decarcassor> Wow. Rank 20 black pip. Incredible.
[1:23:20] <%Roasted_Pheasant> Just to have fun as a killer
[1:23:21] <+Zamorouskiwhich> @PeachSaliva Make sure to read that red addon
[1:23:22] <LaughingCatt> WHATS THAT SMELL
[1:23:25] <+Zamorouskiwhich> Oh...
[1:23:30] <krymzen5> oh
[1:23:34] <KingGoblodyte> IT'S BLUUD
[1:23:37] <ace23691> It sb lood
[1:23:39] <%SoFarFetched> maybe they have the blood pack like 40k games have LUL
[1:23:39] <largo1337> SFW BABY!!!
[1:23:49] <largo1337> wait SWF*
[1:23:50] <%Ell1ot> i've seen people use discord chat
[1:23:52] <detritus25> PROXIMITY MOM CHAT
[1:23:52] <ace23691> Yeah they cant talk
[1:23:54] <+FrostMass22> It doesn't matter because SWF breaks the meta of the game
[1:23:55] <Rostichenburg> This game has lore?
[1:23:59] <ace23691> Except for Ash
[1:24:00] <Daxalog> They shout for help dont they?
[1:24:03] <cursedcharley> I just figured it was so they wouldn't risk a killer hearing 'em
[1:24:07] <Tinosruler> ash can talk
[1:24:07] <ArtoriasTheTrenchfighter> People absolutely discord this
[1:24:08] <%SoFarFetched> yeah theres like chapters I believe.
[1:24:08] <$Corporate_Redeemer> @peachsaliva He can see you if you're next to blood drops. You also can't normally see them unless he uses a ultra rare add-ons that also reveals your aura
[1:24:10] <+ClaudeMcGarren> @Rostichenburg yes
[1:24:12] <%Promessa_EX> just play in a disco and gogo
[1:24:13] <coke_monster> @rostichenburg It also has doujins!
[1:24:14] <CurrySauseBandit> Probably? But being able to talk would be OP in this game anyway as 4 survs. SWF is cancer enough. :\
[1:24:15] <$Mendin> i love sailor Steve
[1:24:18] <BlacSoul> i feel like Prox is fine, SWF is booty butt cheeks
[1:24:19] <+StooEsq> Hunt: Showdown has proximity voice chat, but then people could use Discord to get around that
[1:24:22] <ovan20> @PeachSaliva they can't talk because the killer would have no chance and every voice chat online is horrible.
[1:24:23] <@PlagueOfGripes> who is that donald duck mother fucker
[1:24:25] <@PlagueOfGripes> kill him
[1:24:31] <+ClaudeMcGarren> @StooEsq and yet they dont lol
[1:24:32] <%Tyonidus> LMAO PLAGUE
[1:24:33] <%mostundesired> Scoops ahoy
[1:24:36] <%Tyonidus> I CANNOT UNSEE IT
[1:24:37] <$Mendin> Scoops Ahoy, plague
[1:24:39] <detritus25> I agree with plague
[1:24:40] <ace23691> Indeed
[1:24:41] <Jeemukun> I'm paiting some CSM while watching this and thinking to myself that GW should get in on this and get 'em to make a Night Lord killer
[1:24:44] <+blastazoid26> Steve Harrington is pretty tall
[1:24:45] <astroPunkFunk> hiya peach <3
[1:24:49] <Ion_Laser> lol
[1:24:50] <CrackerJack450> LUL plague
[1:24:53] <$Rumbutt> But SWF still uses discord and just dunks on killers
[1:24:55] <Ner234> Be More Rude
[1:24:56] <ace23691> SCOOPS
[1:24:58] <detritus25> Mom voice chats are all chats
[1:25:01] <$Corporate_Redeemer> RESPECT THE HARRINGTON
[1:25:03] <%Tyonidus> God @PlagueOfGripes I love you, never stop being you buddy.
[1:25:03] <%rumtumtugnutz> @PlagueOfGripes He's not Donald Duck. He's wearing pants.
[1:25:03] <Mrman617> Anyone can talk, but most choose not to so the other side doesn't hear them
[1:25:03] <roundii> That's Steven Stranger Things
[1:25:04] <weissguard> Scoops AHOY
[1:25:06] <Alpha8087> @PeachSaliva I mean if you drastically cut the killers field of view in a special rules match voicechat could work
[1:25:06] <studleydoorite> Plague is like a dog the owner can't admit is a problem
[1:25:07] <Rostichenburg> He's not Donald Duck he waers pants
[1:25:07] <BlacSoul> now we need to kill him
[1:25:09] <+Blargimazombie> That's a Stranger Thing
[1:25:12] <JumbleJams> i've seen lp's of ppl playing with friends and talking and the killer still wins most of the time
[1:25:13] <astroPunkFunk> senpai has noticed me
[1:25:14] <$nademonkey1100> i dont think plague has any other setting than rude
[1:25:27] <%Tyonidus> Paige is definitely going to hell for all these curse words! Tsk tsk!
[1:25:29] <Psych_man13_13> Wraith
[1:25:29] <SpaceGuntank> the Doctor
[1:25:33] <keatiestofthegribbles> doctor
[1:25:34] <ace23691> Monitor and Abuse
[1:25:35] <cursedcharley> Think it's the wraith
[1:25:38] <%galaxyswirl> wraith has a perk that does that @PeachSaliva
[1:25:38] <$Corporate_Redeemer> Wraith and Shock Doc
[1:25:38] <+Schlomogoldbergsteinowitz> plague only has horny and rude
[1:25:49] <DuoScratch> shadowborn is the big one.
[1:25:56] <$joylent_blue> rudely horny
[1:25:58] <%Tyonidus> Don't forget "Not a furry!"
[1:26:02] <ace23691> Theres a wraith perk too
[1:26:06] <detritus25> Game ingenuity, in this economy?
[1:26:06] <$Rumbutt> It's the Nurse's map
[1:26:07] <theDJDnetwork> Good evening Paige and Pat! Having a good day?
[1:26:12] <Rostichenburg> Rude + Horny = Rorny?
[1:26:20] <Ner234> I've never seen everyone spawn at the same spot before.
[1:26:23] <%Roasted_Pheasant> They're so disturbed they disturbed off the roof
[1:26:25] <$Varlinator> Rude & Horny sounds like a B rock band
[1:26:26] <ace23691> Run to the center building if you get in achase!
[1:26:28] <$Rumbutt> the indoor hospital is the doctors map, outdoors asylum is the nurse's
[1:26:29] <Decarcassor> You are thinking about the Léry Memorial map
[1:26:30] <+crimsonharvest> the lords of duckwalk
[1:26:30] <%SoFarFetched> or horny + rude = HORDE
[1:26:35] <Roz_Lynd> this is a weird asylum
[1:26:36] <%SoFarFetched> FOR THE HORDE
[1:26:37] <$Mendin> confusing asylum with Lerys
[1:26:39] <astroPunkFunk> pop a skelly
[1:26:40] <Roz_Lynd> there are trees growing outta the floor

[1:26:48] <%SoFarFetched> look at those twins
[1:26:49] <+keyoray> I wonder if a proximity activated voice chat would work. And the killer, if close enough, can here as well.
[1:26:49] <SpaceGuntank> a glitch in the matrix!
[1:26:49] <studleydoorite> I wish I was that generator

[1:29:18] <+thegreenbenis> OH FUCK IT'S SHREK
[1:29:22] <televisedrevolting> For ass.
[1:29:24] <mechengineers> sorry meant who is the killer paige is facing? like is he new or just a new skin?
[1:29:29] <+Schlomogoldbergsteinowitz> Quick paige get out of his swamp
[1:29:29] <thehashslingingslashers> he has abilities and add-ons that can find players
[1:29:30] <theDJDnetwork> Whoa! The person you took of that hook looked scarier than the monster chasing you. Props!
[1:29:31] <goombella> ew, he's slugging
[1:29:32] <eyelessstrider> Hust popped into stream and thought peach was an old man playing video games
[1:29:34] <moistborne> the sound design for oni is fucking great, he's t
[1:29:37] <keatiestofthegribbles> spirits dad
[1:29:41] <%galaxyswirl> @PeachSaliva whats your opinion of downing all 4 survivors without putting any of them on hooks?
[1:29:41] <ace23691> What are you doing in meh swamp?
[1:29:51] <%ArtemisM822> Oni’s ability basically forces him to slug
[1:29:56] <DuoScratch> Oni's gonna slug, he's designed to slug. It's the weirdest choice ever.
[1:30:01] <+Ascethetic> Oni are so dope
[1:30:07] <Habblewater> @mechengineers Oni, a new one
[1:30:07] <coke_monster> Sneaky breaky.
[1:30:10] <rusho> Slugging?
[1:30:18] <Decarcassor> @goombella sadly the way his power work encourage slugging. His lose his power gauge when he pick up survivors. :/
[1:30:21] <detritus25> Somebody once told me...
[1:30:22] <%ArtemisM822> Slugging is downing people without hooking them
[1:30:25] <ace23691> Leaving them on the ground is called slugging
[1:30:26] <laserbeaming> isw pwaige in cwoncentwation mode?
[1:30:26] <SulfurousAcid> born 2 slug
[1:30:29] <goombella> huh.
[1:30:30] <Alpha8087> How the hell can they even walk, a hook went right through them, unless theres RE herbs in that first aid kit
[1:30:30] <+Schlomogoldbergsteinowitz> What the hell, paige is really good at this game
[1:30:30] <CelioHogane> Damm... paige is super good
[1:30:31] <theDJDnetwork> You're carrying your team... Literally, you're picking them up and putting g them back down.
[1:30:39] <mechengineers> okay so it is a new one and and the wikis out 9f date
[1:31:01] <$Corporate_Redeemer> Paige just work on gens. You're being too altruistic
[1:31:02] <DuoScratch> @mechengineers it's because this is the PTB, so the wiki won't update till he's actually live.
[1:31:06] <laserbeaming> I think it's the power of the Cuve
[1:31:10] <laserbeaming> Cube
[1:31:10] <Rostichenburg> It seems like they combined an Oni with a Hannya with the face and the hair mixed with the spiked club
[1:31:12] <+Taisuru> I've never once seen this game from the killers perspective
[1:31:15] <+Reizie_Etherealm> Seems like any means necessary is met with no means available
[1:31:15] <ace23691> ONI is super dope though
[1:31:25] <%Binary_Fireball> I wonder how much this place would go for on the market. At least 3M
[1:31:34] <astroPunkFunk> i like the big roar
[1:31:37] <GreyFoxHoundDD> He's so loud!
[1:31:40] <laserbeaming> Helping out the new girl, that's cute
[1:31:41] <+Diabetic> He sounds like a fucking t-rex stomping
[1:31:45] <laserbeaming> and her identical twin
[1:31:50] <Rostichenburg> ONI is the best game Bungie ever made
[1:31:59] <ace23691> No market value to much blood
[1:32:01] <Finakala> ONI was pretty fun
[1:32:04] <goombella> This went poorly last time.
[1:32:05] <coke_monster> That spooked me a bit.
[1:32:05] <astroPunkFunk> oni makes sure you know that you're fucked
[1:32:06] <Ner234> Don't die Pat monkaS
[1:32:07] <Alpha8087> Its Mary Kate and Ashley running from the tv sitcom past, the Oni
[1:32:08] <%ArtemisM822> The new girl has Meg’s voice as a place holder and it bothers me lol 😂
[1:32:08] <+logoth_> Otogi is the best Fromsoftware game ever made
[1:32:10] <GreyFoxHoundDD> And now Pat is also trying to be spooky

[2:07:06] <mayorrev> aw you couldve messed with him
[2:07:09] <astroPunkFunk> he stomp
[2:07:13] <krymzen5> cool
[2:07:16] <Habblewater> bwaaah that paige ain't right
[2:07:25] <%starotter70> Honestly, i didn't know the recovery bit. I though you were just being Paige LUL
[2:07:31] <+Schlomogoldbergsteinowitz> Would you say this game is beginner friendly, or is it a steeper learning curve?
[2:07:43] <krymzen5> hmm
[2:07:45] <BlacSoul> yes
[2:07:49] <%supercasualboom> @peachsaliva Pics sent
[2:07:53] <+iamtrlly> I wish there was a way to recover without friends
[2:07:53] <krymzen5> kinda hard to say
[2:07:57] <keatiestofthegribbles> steep learning
[2:08:02] <%Breakfast_Megapowers> well at least we are only running from killers in videogame land and not in real life
[2:08:15] <Veeberschnitzel> There are a couple perks that let you recover without help
[2:08:25] <Tinosruler> unbreakable bill perk
[2:08:32] <Soul3Solo> The 13th of every month
[2:08:32] <Tinosruler> and no mither
[2:08:33] <krymzen5> i'd suggest watching a tutorial
[2:08:35] <nobody12349> It get really confusing when that one killer introduced Roman Cancels. Or the other that uses the Zapping system
[2:08:36] <%ArtemisM822> The perk is unbreakable (or no mither if you hate yourself)
[2:08:36] <%TheFilth> learn through failure
[2:08:37] <Rumbutt> @PeachSaliva There are two perks: Unbreakable lets you do it once, No Mither lets you do it any time, but you are always one shot
[2:08:43] <Veeberschnitzel> Unbreakable lets you recover completely once and always gives you faster recover speed. And no mither makes you always a one shot down but you can Always get up.
[2:08:57] <keatiestofthegribbles> evey 13th of the month they reset the clock
[2:08:58] <CrimsonFox777> Rank resets are monthly, I believe.
[2:09:05] <+iamtrlly> Its Not terribly difficult as a newbie. It takes a minute to figure out what you need to do but as far as staying alive long enough to learn without getting frustrated i'd say its fair.
[2:09:07] <+chippracoon> do you know if this is cross play?
[2:09:10] <BeefyQueefer> If you learned through failure then Paige would be the best person ever at everything.
[2:09:21] <Veeberschnitzel> Killer vs survivor is a very different experience. But playing both sides really helps understanding of the game
[2:09:21] <%starotter70> You do suprisingly well playing as the almost deceased
[2:09:27] <keatiestofthegribbles> no
[2:09:28] <Veeberschnitzel> It is not cross platform yet
[2:09:29] <Rumbutt> it is not cross platform
[2:09:33] <Soul3Solo> It's not cross
[2:09:35] <%ArtemisM822> Not yet
[2:09:41] <SulfurousAcid> it's death hide and seek tag
[2:09:43] <Rumbutt> and console is way behind PC on updates from what I understand
[2:09:43] <+chippracoon> aww it should be cross
[2:09:43] <+Blargimazombie> in your ass?
[2:09:45] <Mrman617> It is cross platform with Steam and Windows Store or atleast they are testing it
[2:09:49] <Tinosruler> every 13 of the month rank get reset
[2:09:58] <CrimsonFox777> Even at Portal!
[2:10:01] <BurningLlama777> Great streamers like PeachSaliva? :D
[2:10:05] <+iamtrlly> BUT, with Xbox Game Pass you can have it on PC and XBOX
[2:10:06] <Soul3Solo> Monto
[2:10:13] <wholewheat420> Morf, Cahla and Tokki are good DBD streamers!
[2:10:19] <$joylent_blue> Otzdarva is great too
[2:10:21] <Flukyjoker> PainReliever has a soothing voice, and always gives good tips
[2:10:24] <Conky89> If it is behind on updates, it is probably because updating games on console is a real bastard for indie devs.
[2:10:26] <+Schlomogoldbergsteinowitz> radical, downloading now
[2:10:29] <SulfurousAcid> I checked out Cahlaflour yesterday on your recommendation and she's fun
[2:10:30] <BurningLlama777> I was being honest!
[2:10:30] <Veeberschnitzel> I follow OhTofu as one of mine
[2:10:32] <BurningLlama777> :(

[2:18:38] <+VidyaFranX> @PeachSaliva If you don't hit the great skill check with Ruin, just stop until the smoke clears because the gen doesn't progress during that and you could trigger another skill check

[2:22:45] <$Scarnehu> bill nye the science guy
[2:22:50] <ChloeFleurage> the reason there's more jerks around is because every time a game updates, the fair-weather fans show up
[2:22:53] <$joylent_blue> don't be such a BILL, BILL
[2:22:54] <BeefyQueefer> wait is that bill cosplaying as Dante?
[2:22:55] <%Sphincter_Spelunker> Bill Nye is actually kind of an asshole
[2:22:58] <Habblewater> Bill Stickers will be prosecuted
[2:22:59] <+Schlomogoldbergsteinowitz> #notallbills
[2:23:00] <%a_wizard_in_space> don't fuck this up Bill
[2:23:08] <%ArtemisM822> Same
[2:23:09] <a_mad_dragon> if your bills are shitty, use coins instead
[2:23:10] <mayorrev> No dont worry this is the nice bill
[2:23:27] <mayorrev> This bill died for our sins
[2:23:42] <BurningLlama777> I tried to crouch-walk like that once and it's murder on your legs.
[2:23:51] <+Reizie_Etherealm> Walky talky
[2:23:57] <TonyPullMyDTRedgrave> Sorry if this was answered already, but what does cleansing totems do?
[2:24:00] <%ArtemisM822> Paige, you can still cleanse dull totems for points and to avoid noed
[2:24:04] <+mattymcfilth> you also cant listen and read at the same time
[2:24:22] <mayorrev> He's going super saiyan
[2:24:23] <%a_wizard_in_space> he big screm
[2:24:24] <+DesertPenguin> Hey Paige, ever break your foot?
[2:24:29] <%ArtemisM822> Some totems are lit and connected to perks
[2:24:31] <%AncelDeLambert> @PeachSaliva we have yet to hear any oinking from you, what gives?
[2:24:41] <%ArtemisM822> So you cleanse the totem to remove the perk
[2:24:42] <mayorrev> she oinked earlier
[2:24:48] <D3rrtyD4n> Clap
[2:24:49] <+mattymcfilth> is that the oni?
[2:24:54] <hntronium> she did the piggy noises earlier
[2:24:56] <krymzen5> i do
[2:25:06] <Soul3Solo> yes
[2:25:08] <%ArtemisM822> Noed is a perk that is activated at the end of the game if there are still any dull (not lit) totems
[2:25:08] <TonyPullMyDTRedgrave> @ArtemisM822 oh so like, its linked to the killers perks?
[2:25:08] <Nox_ludicro> NOED lights at the end
[2:25:09] <Habblewater> LIT AF
[2:25:09] <+Schlomogoldbergsteinowitz> CurseLit
[2:25:10] <%QueequegTheater> Hey look it's DS2 chasing you
[2:25:10] <goombella> Noed only lights when the gates happen, right?
[2:25:11] <D3rrtyD4n> thats not very lit fam
[2:25:12] <Rumbutt> NOED lights up when all gens are done
[2:25:18] <+VidyaFranX> NOED activates only on dull totems, so if you get them all before end game, NOED won't go off
[2:25:18] <Dementedpenguin> it gets lit after all gens are done. If there are any totems remaining
[2:25:19] <Rumbutt> if there are no totems, no NOED
[2:25:24] <Nox_ludicro> So if there's no totems to light, NOED no worky
[2:25:26] <mayorrev> DOOR STUCK
[2:25:27] <krymzen5> ?
[2:25:28] <%a_wizard_in_space> sipsipHellmo lit as AF

[2:49:15] <%Sphincter_Spelunker> Boomers at heart
[2:49:22] <BurningLlama777> We are free of the Boomer curse
[2:49:25] <KingGoblodyte> Born before 1965
[2:49:25] <$FrogROOT> WRONG AGAIN PAIGE
[2:49:26] <%ThePuddingDead> I feel like the definition of Boomer has completely lost its meaning just recently
[2:49:26] <BurningLlama777> R...right...?
[2:49:26] <%nofestu2> boomer is a state of mind
[2:49:27] <%TheFilth> Boomer is a way of life
[2:49:27] <+Schlomogoldbergsteinowitz> Detroit: Become Boomer

[2:49:32] <CrimKangaroo> @Sphincter_Spelunker seconded
[2:49:32] <a_mad_dragon> if someone's older than you, they're a boomer
[2:49:35] <Alseid> Boomers aren't born, they're made
[2:49:38] <%lewdskeletor13> Boomer is a mindset
[2:49:43] <%a_wizard_in_space> You may not be a Boomer by birth but you can be a Boomer by heart.

[2:49:50] <graemecrackers1> Boomerborne
[2:49:50] <BurningLlama777> I think as long as you're not willing to destroy the planet for your children, you're not a Boomer.
[2:49:53] <%Tyonidus> Is Elmo a boomer in cat years?
[2:49:54] <$FrogROOT> hi paige
[2:50:00] <CrimKangaroo> is boomer a state of mind?
