[0:44:41] <cureneckbeard> peepoops.
[0:44:41] <%CommanderSqueaks> Peach squeals when she's telling the truth.
[0:44:42] <VritraReiRei> @peachsaliva typically kids have more bitter taste buds and little sweet taste buds which is why they like candy but hate vegetables. as we grow older, we get more sweet taste buds compared to bitter things which is why adults like things like coffee and dark chocolate. that must mean you are the OPPOSITE
[0:44:42] <@SoFarFetched> You'RE DUMPING on the floor with trash
[0:44:44] <%AncelDeLambert> PAT YOU LITTER ACTIVELY!

[0:45:07] <$sumrand0> As a child I used to be excited for the future. Now I couldn't care less, even when it's good it usually got hyped up as great for months ahead of time so it's hard to even enjoy things because everything is hyped as "the best ever" or "a total failure" the never ending hyperbole makes me loath humanity
[0:45:10] <Hirschensky> i litter with my poop

[1:09:56] <socratetris> Imagine how much bullshit the average person thinks they are owed. Now imagine an entire society filled with people. The Law has to balance all of that bullshit so that most people feel like the bullshit fair. That's why the Law is the way it is. Not Lawyers fault, it's them pesky humans

[1:38:19] <%I4gotmyname89> i'm excited for that
[1:38:19] <wibbwobbler> shweet
[1:38:19] <~PeachSaliva> @shurtal har!!
[1:38:21] <+SWFanatic> Triple Triad
[1:38:22] <AMajorTom> I like the crossover where he meets lil‚Äô Amber

[1:38:42] <%CommanderSqueaks> "I almost died, let's play FF8!"
[1:38:53] <+deviljhojho_> FUCK THE DRAW SYSTEM
[1:38:55] <bob900000> yup
[1:38:56] <Rickbane> oh noo FFVIII
[1:38:59] <%Ranryu692> Woolie and Liam playing FF8 is one of my favorite SBFP episodes still
[1:39:00] <Laecerelius> UGH

[1:39:02] <+Jaromero435> peepee poopoo

[1:39:10] <coreyyotto> the battle system should've just been triple triad
[1:39:13] <cureneckbeard> abipopHYPE
[1:39:15] <%CommanderSqueaks> Triple Triad is literally the only reason anyone tricks themselves into liking FF8. Fight me.
[1:39:17] <Laecerelius> But then Triple Triad, a much better system, invalidates that shit system
[1:39:19] <Broken_Sonex> I like when Plague complains about things i hate :)
[1:39:20] <LoneFonte> oh yikes

[1:39:28] <boomstickery> imagine following up the materia system with the junction system...worst drop off in gaming
[1:39:29] <%rumtumtugnutz> It‚Äôs almost like ffviii is a bad jpg
[1:39:38] <Laecerelius> Get that Diablos to ingore battles!

[1:40:20] <2ndlaav> cards! your words are funny magic man
[1:40:23] <%ssjklyco> I liked 9's beter
[1:40:24] <+AmanisHouseOfNonsense> I like FF8 because it have cards, and cards like YUGIOH. Not really.
[1:40:25] <%walternatorz> Triple Triad is worth it alone
[1:40:26] <+Stormzcales_Lair> its poor mans tripple triad
[1:40:27] <+gamerform> is this the PPP cast
[1:40:27] <UW_Duncan> 8
[1:40:31] <Melchior_the_Wise> Not as good as Pazaak though
[1:40:31] <+Stormzcales_Lair> Triad is better
[1:40:34] <@SoFarFetched> Final Fantasy 9's card game was Tetra Master.
[1:40:36] <%CommanderSqueaks> Triple Triad is good, it is literally the only good thing out of FF8.
[1:40:37] <+Solid_Stro> Can I instead just hit something until it dies and beat the game like that?
[1:40:40] <bob900000> the card game in 8 is better
[1:40:40] <%I4gotmyname89> I just keep my characters HP yellow and use their limits over and over
[1:40:41] <boomstickery> i did the clap
[1:40:41] <islandsunn> there's an animation with woolie and liam in it about triple triad

[1:41:02] <islandsunn> have you tried turning off and turning it back on again
[1:41:05] <Rellim80> Upgrade?
[1:41:08] <Jetsfantasy> FF 8's battle theme is the only mainline battle theme that ISN'T in a 4/4 time signature.

[1:41:46] <boomstickery> you sparked joy in many people
[1:41:47] <%CommanderSqueaks> @Timesteel Even so, by default game uninstalls don't remove saves.
[1:41:47] <filialpails> @PeachSaliva try disabling shader pre-caching in steam's settings, it downloads and processes shaders in the background
[1:41:48] <SirKeigan> YES!!!!!!
[1:41:49] <+AXL808> Paige can ride the dragon up to the cloud and get her save back
[1:41:49] <%BinaryFireball> or bugsnax
[1:41:51] <+VvTacoSaladvV> @Timesteel It's true. DS3 does not have cloud saves. I learned this the hard way.

[1:56:40] <$sumrand0> @sirkeigan it sure is: there's definitely a bit more pre-play setup required but that's the price to pay for better performance & the ability to use mods that can completely change games in new and interesting ways!

[2:10:59] <$thewhiterice92> Good ol‚Äô vacuum hands
[2:10:59] <BinaryShuffle> Punish the grab Paige!
[2:11:03] <Fien111> Hug as close as possible and roll INTO him, rolling away takes too long to get back to hit. Rolling straight back is basically useless against almost all enemies
[2:11:03] <+Solid_Stro> Woolie you have to hit them psaWhat
[2:11:03] <%VvTacoSaladvV> FromSoft is good at hitboxes, but terrible at grab boxes lol
[2:11:03] <+patriotrenegade> u gotta HIT THEM

[2:11:10] <cipher758> now you are the treasure
[2:11:10] <Laecerelius> Grab hit boxes tend to suck
[2:11:12] <EuropanLamprey> you can try luring it into the dragon
[2:11:15] <Scorchfield> too much not swinging, too much dodging in front again
[2:11:18] <%Divryne> VORED.
[2:11:21] <Finakala> Yeah, grab hitboxes in Souls are never quite right
[2:11:22] <+parrotman01> Where is the webcam Paige? KappaHD
[2:11:24] <Broken_Sonex> You have to HIT him Woolie
[2:11:24] <Charlie99993> Less panic rolls
[2:11:29] <SoySocks> their punches and kicks aren't too bad to walk out of the way from
[2:11:35] <thebehatted> mimics are pretty annoying
[2:11:36] <+rsg220> isn't two handing mediocre in 3?
[2:11:36] <$thomassolorio> almost
[2:11:39] <KellBeII> enemies in general in 3 tend to be really tanky
[2:11:44] <SirKeigan> Do a two-handed charged R2 to start
[2:11:50] <%GraceTBM> 100% agreed they're not very fun
[2:11:50] <+KaiserKeen> she has a shield?
[2:11:56] <%VvTacoSaladvV> Dark Souls 3 is the Bloodborne of Dark Souls games.
[2:11:57] <mostundesired> I wouldn't call them bloodborne enemies, but yeah.

[2:14:42] <ObesePanda1212> YOU'RE DOING IT
[2:14:43] <DianaTheAscian> Woolie would have died and spent 5min explaining how his loss was part of his plan
[2:14:45] <promessav2> i wouldn't want to lose the longsword moveset and scaling
[2:14:47] <Mr_Strut> Everything is broken
[2:14:50] <+rsg220> im glad it's not just me having wireless controller issues

[2:14:55] <+DemonOfSalt> That axe is deep. It knows a thing or two.
[2:14:55] <+SWFanatic> Do it for Yuki-Chan
[2:14:56] <Mister_McDerp> wireless never ever
[2:14:58] <%Ranryu692> I like the DualSense, but I hope they still make a DualShock 5
[2:15:00] <$SvenHolgersson> That sounds awful Eli
[2:15:02] <mostundesired> Dropped inputs NotLikeThis
[2:15:04] <%CommanderSqueaks> Who would ever use a wireless keyboard.

[2:15:09] <SirKeigan> mult-eyeplayer, not multee-player?
[2:15:13] <chhdez> IS it?
[2:15:18] <SUTTONSOMEGA> but wireless gaming mice are good now
[2:15:20] <+cdrom321> No. It needs a wire.
[2:15:24] <YakumoYomi> I sit so close to my consoles/PC that wireless is kinda pointless
[2:15:24] <$NitronStreams> Is it the ghosts?
[2:15:24] <Dhurkst> @Ranryu692 pretty sure it *is* Dualshock 5
[2:15:26] <trianglehat> the government is intercepting your controller signals

[2:19:06] <Broken_Sonex> Fuck Pat's PC. Woolie PC for Life
[2:19:07] <promessav2> it has very loud hit confirm sounds
[2:19:07] <Mister_McDerp> Slap Souls
[2:19:09] <+patriotrenegade> Paige
[2:19:09] <AdmiralButtloaf> the PC knows that Paige was against pat getting the 3080
[2:19:12] <+OdysseyKnight> The controller has become Gold Experience Requiem while the PC has become King Crimson
[2:19:13] <+patriotrenegade> PAIGE
[2:19:14] <+LiquidDinosaur> BB is good DS is good this is lukewarm
[2:19:18] <Lancaster_H> we get it Eli you like it slow
[2:19:19] <+OdysseyKnight> and Paige is in the middle of the battle
[2:19:23] <+D00msDayDan> ds3 enemies are bloodborne aggressive
[2:19:24] <+patriotrenegade> @PeachSaliva Paige otherway
[2:19:25] <+sn0rlaxxxx> A shield bash is supposed to destroy stamina. Thats the point.
[2:19:25] <Fien111> DS2 just made MORE enemies
[2:19:28] <KellBeII> enemies flail their weaapons in front of them and do 800 damage
[2:19:29] <+other_badger> ds2 had the green club guys
[2:19:30] <+TopTieramisu> ds3 is dark souls pretending to be bloodborne
[2:19:34] <promessav2> ds2 faster with impossible parry
[2:19:40] <+Mitchellsocks> "We'll bang it out over the Fall!" This is what, stream 2?
[2:19:44] <+DemonOfSalt> That makes sense Plague. Everything is just generally angrier in this point in this world's history.
[2:19:47] <+CapnClassix> I beat Dark Souls, which would I play next?
[2:19:56] <promessav2> play dark souls again
[2:19:56] <Melchior_the_Wise> DS3 is Bloodborne Pretending to be Dark souls.
[2:19:56] <BoxNavy> @Mitchellsocks she was injured to be fair
[2:19:57] <%T_Sasquatch> im talking shit but i really like ds3
[2:20:06] <SirKeigan> it doesn't hurt that much tho
[2:20:11] <+AtlasMcCoy> My god I can't even remember when the first DS3 stream was
[2:20:13] <Fien111> Well....GIT GUD
[2:20:14] <+Mitchellsocks> @BoxNavy true
[2:20:15] <SirKeigan> Each hit isn't taking much HP
[2:20:22] <+patriotrenegade> @PeachSaliva u dont have to fight him
[2:20:22] <%CommanderSqueaks> Parrying requires patience, and calm...
[2:20:24] <extradopeness> I‚Äôll be back, I have to finish the last half hour of the new Action Button video.
[2:20:25] <L0CKE_C0LE> DS2 was really slow combat
[2:20:25] <the_Graboid> Could try out the weapon skills.
[2:20:26] <generalve> he's fucking pain in the ass
[2:20:27] <SirKeigan> you can kick his shield
[2:20:29] <%rumtumtugnutz> Blood borne is Bloodborne pretending to be Dark Souls.
[2:20:37] <$Chatterbox1991> Bloodbornem
[2:20:37] <+pheblorganzardo> tbh dark battleaxe isnt really much better than the longsword
[2:20:40] <BoxNavy> man these guys are rough
[2:20:40] <generalve> pattttttttt - paige
[2:20:47] <+pheblorganzardo> much worse moveset
[2:20:47] <%Lion_kun> paige you can drink twice in one motion
[2:20:49] <+coke_monster> That knight kicked her ass.
[2:20:50] <promessav2> ds3 parry is almost good, but the enemies are so fast sometimes
[2:20:55] <thebehatted> why do we choose to fight anything?
[2:20:57] <LoneFonte> asserting dominance
[2:20:59] <+TopTieramisu> Dark Souls is Dark Souls 3 pretending to not be Bloodborne
[2:21:00] <thebehatted> because it's there
[2:21:02] <SirKeigan> We're not getting the claymore?
[2:21:05] <+Mitchellsocks> Dark Battleaxe is nice in that it does extra to Vordt, but it's mid
[2:21:09] <Fien111> It was all Pointless!
[2:21:11] <Mister_McDerp> no claymore FeelsBadMan
[2:21:14] <the_Graboid> The claymore tho...
[2:21:15] <%CommanderSqueaks> Pat you are fine.
[2:21:18] <promessav2> if you can kill him a bunch, his armor is nice
[2:21:18] <+tigerfang86> it's all good pat pieHug
[2:21:20] <BoxNavy> and hes back
[2:21:24] <BoxNavy> :)
[2:21:24] <@SoFarFetched> Youre fine Pat,it was just a weird hiccup
[2:21:27] <generalve> no facecam ?
[2:21:27] <Fien111> But not this day tho
[2:21:30] <LoneFonte> u did good, pat
[2:21:30] <SirKeigan> perfect paige
[2:21:31] <+CapnClassix> No worries Pat, the convo was still enjoyable
[2:21:32] <cintra212> Its a bigger toothpick tho
[2:21:32] <+FoolsArcade> Paige says fuck you pat I'm having fun
[2:21:35] <BoxNavy> the hanging out is part of the fun
[2:21:38] <SirKeigan> 3
[2:21:39] <+Mitchellsocks> Have claymore. No claymore.
[2:21:40] <boomstickery> lol
[2:21:44] <%Ranryu692> you did a shit job, Pat
[2:21:44] <%CommanderSqueaks> Did Peach just ULTRA INSTINCT that mook?
[2:21:44] <islandsunn> Item
[2:21:46] <KellBeII> hi squeaks
[2:21:47] <+AmanisHouseOfNonsense> Pat, you did a psaBig good, don't worry.
[2:21:47] <SirKeigan> item
[2:21:47] <YakumoYomi> Shame, Patrick. SHAME!...but seriously, don't worry about it.
[2:21:48] <@SoFarFetched> @generalve yeah shes not f eeling it today since shes probably laying down at a weird angle because of her back.
[2:21:48] <Fien111> @generalve Paige is broken, camerca cannot
[2:21:48] <Ner234> really? That causes fall damage?
[2:21:50] <%Lion_kun> guys which is better DES or DS3?\
[2:21:51] <+Derpinator102> Do I hear the Plague
[2:21:51] <LeiaSkynoober> Love you pat! You‚Äôre big and smart for fixing the stuff
[2:21:51] <%Mr_y1096> mmm
[2:21:55] <Explodincatz> page just spank pat so he can get his cummies
[2:21:56] <+AtlasMcCoy> big blind
[2:21:56] <BoxNavy> monkaS
[2:21:57] <%T_Sasquatch> I swear this area was much darker for me
[2:21:58] <promessav2> does she have cell lift key?
[2:22:00] <Melchior_the_Wise> Is DS2 the hardest of all the souls Games?
[2:22:03] <generalve> COVID is so fucked in new Jersey right now
[2:22:06] <Melchior_the_Wise> including DLC
[2:22:09] <rosencruez> have confidence!
[2:22:09] <+tigerfang86> Womfidence....
[2:22:10] <%CommanderSqueaks> I think Peach just pulled a fucking Ultra Instinct on that Hollow, she dodged it without even realizing it was there.
[2:22:14] <Sunstalker> No confadance
[2:22:15] <+Dingalow> Have confidence. No confidence
[2:22:19] <$rdark_ksu> Uncle Touch's basement
[2:22:20] <+rsg220> overconfidence is a slow and asdjkasndasasd
[2:22:24] <BoxNavy> no confidence jermaPluto
[2:22:24] <heartlesshealer> psaGiefrail <3
[2:22:27] <%Lion_kun> After recently playing DES, I've grown to like it a lot. DS3 is so homogenized in its balance, it's kinda dull.
[2:22:28] <vinceshamwowslap> poor barrels did nothing wrong
[2:22:28] <+AmanisHouseOfNonsense> And with great longfidence, cums giant dicks
[2:22:29] <+FlameLoneWolf> Aww
[2:22:33] <+Mitchellsocks> People always say this one is easy, but a lot of these bosses are harder than any of them in the rest of the series for me.
[2:22:33] <SirKeigan> Kinda
[2:22:35] <SirKeigan> 2-1
[2:22:36] <+TopTieramisu> i don't think that's ultra instinct, that's mr magoo
[2:22:39] <SirKeigan> Fat official tho
[2:22:39] <generalve> why does grief always have his younger out when sleeping ?
[2:22:40] <Dhurkst> actually yeah
[2:22:42] <Fien111> That dog goin NUTS
[2:22:43] <%T_Sasquatch> Issa TRAP
[2:22:43] <$thomassolorio> zang squeef
[2:22:43] <+SWFanatic> MercyWing1 psaDogchamp MercyWing2 <3
[2:22:45] <mostundesired> Could've been worse.
[2:22:46] <BoxNavy> the one with the fat official?
[2:22:47] <generalve> *toubge
[2:22:49] <$SinisterBroccoli> You should've loaded up the cinders mod for paige without her knowing
[2:22:50] <Grandma_Amari> Huh, neat homage
[2:22:51] <+Derpinator102> execpt this one dosent crash your game
[2:22:52] <generalve> *tounge
[2:22:53] <+OdysseyKnight> Dog Official
[2:23:02] <+Mitchellsocks> Yeah, the 2-1 fat official room. With the dog boxes
[2:23:03] <+FlameLoneWolf> Wrestling bears in his sleep
[2:23:05] <+TopTieramisu> @Grandma_Amari "neat homage" is ds3 in a nutshell
[2:23:07] <thebehatted> he sees his mom and dad in his dreams and he is happy
[2:23:16] <Sunstalker> Get Paige a greataxe, feels like something she'll do good with
[2:23:17] <Fien111> It's never been used outside of Gwyn
[2:23:21] <thebehatted> his strong mom and angry dad
[2:23:21] <SirKeigan> Really?
[2:23:22] <promessav2> it's kind of worse than rapier
[2:23:25] <+SWFanatic> hey greirat
[2:23:26] <SirKeigan> usless
[2:23:28] <SirKeigan> it's so weak
[2:23:31] <mostundesired> Mailbreaker FeelsBadMan
[2:23:37] <L0CKE_C0LE> Fat official firebomb room= PTSD
[2:23:41] <%T_Sasquatch> I was looking through ds3 armor and holy shit its mostly ds1 ds2 armor
[2:23:43] <thebehatted> but it looks cooooooooooooool
[2:23:45] <BoxNavy> the claws have it worse than the mail breaker jermaPluto
[2:23:47] <Finakala> No really Pat
[2:23:51] <+Mitchellsocks> No medieval weapon. Only great club!
[2:23:54] <Fien111> I mean, you'd need the Aki engine for true medieval combat
[2:23:54] <LoneFonte> yeah but cool greet sword tho
[2:23:59] <LoneFonte> green*
[2:24:00] <chaosfrost462> I have many issues with this game but I still play it and enjoy it
[2:24:00] <$thomassolorio> zang keyf
[2:24:09] <$SinisterBroccoli> I always thought that your character was just picking up all this shit and doesn't know how to use it and just flails wildly
[2:24:09] <promessav2> i want her to get the other key
[2:24:15] <+other_badger> LUL

[2:24:23] <Azathotic> GAMER JOKE
[2:24:29] <promessav2> portals are later
[2:24:29] <%Keyd00d> Keyd00d subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 45 months! 
[2:24:31] <Brofarian> It doesn't recreate medieval weapons very well, but it does FANTASY weapons great
[2:24:31] <%Ranryu692> you shouldn't have tried
[2:24:34] <+other_badger> this cake is so delicious and moist
[2:24:40] <BoxNavy> TTours
[2:24:40] <+zamatermort> shits locked
[2:24:41] <+Mitchellsocks> "It looks like the lock is broken"
[2:24:43] <Fien111> Mitch Hedberg had a great "My wall is not a door" joke
[2:24:43] <+OdysseyKnight> A lot of bits of DS3 felt like "fine we'll make it to pay the bills since we have some leftover Bloodborne assets"
[2:24:46] <+D00msDayDan> Portal means door
[2:24:51] <doublexcreed> Baba IS Paige AND Door
[2:24:54] <+TopTieramisu> ds3 is obligation souls

[2:25:15] <AFlyingTaco1> LUL
[2:25:21] <$thomassolorio> I wonder if that barrel with the light beam on it was important naaaaaaaa
[2:25:22] <+SWFanatic> darksplaining

[2:26:22] <%amymist> he is pretty gnarly looking
[2:26:22] <AFlyingTaco1> The hardest Souls boss is the Camera
[2:26:22] <+TopTieramisu> F
[2:26:23] <@SoFarFetched> Paige you can beat the shit out of that guy before he transforms.
[2:26:23] <+tigerfang86> HE HATES THAT SHIT

[2:26:35] <NeroInfinite> I don'tlike'em
[2:26:35] <promessav2> so you get 2 or 3 free hits when you bomb them
[2:26:37] <+patriotrenegade> oof
[2:26:38] <Djinnazz> that's the point
[2:26:38] <%T_Sasquatch> They're stupid as FUCK

[2:26:54] <%Ranryu692> that reveal is fantastic, but that's the extent of thir appeal

[2:27:03] <promessav2> in that oe he's the one that's not praying
[2:27:04] <+Fooguwu> they're positional, which is why people think it's bullshit. just like midir
[2:27:04] <+SWFanatic> items not worth it
[2:27:05] <Charlie99993> What are those things even called
[2:27:08] <+zamatermort> Paige's constant refrain "I can't see"
[2:27:15] <+Peacefrog7> MonkaW

[2:27:19] <+Peacefrog7> monkaW

[2:27:22] <+LiquidDinosaur> @DemonOfSalt Therefore Sonic Hedgehog is Humanity
[2:27:23] <Djinnazz> Just use fire Plague
[2:27:23] <Gallhint> Dark Souls 3 really could have used another 6mo to a year in the oven
[2:27:24] <chaosfrost462> the pus of man is what happens when your enemy ideology is "dark souls hord"
[2:27:26] <charrison972> It's been fun. Good night all! Glad you finally got it working Pat. Paige, be big and strong.

[2:49:48] <$sumrand0> HAH GOTTIM
[2:49:54] <BoxNavy> Jebaited it gets her every time
[2:50:08] <$Quack_of_Dawn> I've been tempted recently to teach me 7-year-old half-brother souls, any tips?
[2:50:08] <spicystarbursts> are there illusory walls in DES?
[2:50:14] <Finakala> This jump and the one above it are both fucks
[2:50:15] <SubjectX07x> @primaryfire They plan for 1.0 to drop a year after this early access release, which was just on the 20th. Current roadmap goes up through the next 4 months and looks good.
[2:50:18] <Daniel_Is_I> @spicystarbursts In like one zone
[2:50:18] <$sumrand0> DS 3 ESTUS is actually really good IMO
[2:50:24] <$mckraven> I feel like the expectation of it became the mechanic
[2:50:31] <primaryfire> @spicystarbursts theres like 1 in the shrine of storms
[2:50:40] <spicystarbursts> Thanks!
[2:50:41] <Daniel_Is_I> Lost Bastille is the only place in the Souls series that has a lot of illusory walls, really
[2:50:42] <Fien111> Did paige just bump her HP like crazy then?
[2:50:42] <Gallhint> I wonder if people wouldnt put fake illusory wall messages down if negative ratings on soapstones had consequences
[2:50:46] <+Deekman> the new one in DeS was an actual new surprise
[2:50:48] <promessav2> bruh people just put signs mon them and you couldn't even activate them
[2:50:48] <+LiquidDinosaur> ROOM OF ALL MIMICS
[2:50:51] <+cdrom321> I have to stop this drinking game. She's saying tits too many times.
[2:50:55] <SubjectX07x> @primaryfire If I'm not mistaken it's by the same devs as Crypt of the Necrodancer so, I trust em.
[2:50:56] <$sumrand0> mashing is never an enjoyable experience. I don't appreciate beating on my controller intentionally
[2:50:59] <mattatatatatatatat> oh fuck this part
[2:50:59] <+patriotrenegade> two mimics right next to each other
[2:51:00] <+LiquidDinosaur> That one was cool because it was like, they were making mimics
[2:51:00] <Gallhint> but i think people just wouldnt place them to begin with...
[2:51:06] <+LiquidDinosaur> Aldia was making mimics because he's a fuck
[2:51:07] <chaosfrost462> the souls series could be told like final fantasy stories at this point. completely disconnected except for 2 or 3 big things.
[2:51:14] <+AtlasMcCoy> THE BOYS
[2:51:17] <%Keyd00d> make sure to walk into the middle of them
[2:51:18] <Ner234> The squad
[2:51:19] <UlriktheSlayer1> i love that
[2:51:19] <lotharrio> Dark Souls 4. Mimics will take up to three hits before activating.
[2:51:21] <SoySocks> lol she walked in-between ALL of them
[2:51:22] <scrumbotime> The floppiest garbage men
[2:51:24] <SirKeigan> she walks right inot the middle
[2:51:27] <SirKeigan> lol
[2:51:30] <Fien111> The paige drinking game is the sip when she dies/says "tits" and finish when she say "LISTEN...."
[2:51:39] <mellorolo> nada
[2:51:43] <primaryfire> @subjectx07x thsnks man I'll try to follow it a bit closer. necrodancer was tight as hell too, even if I sucked at it. got high hopes for the ost now
[2:51:44] <UlriktheSlayer1> i like it
[2:51:46] <+sugarfreemixup> you can tell if a chest is a mimic based on the chain
[2:51:50] <$heatbugg> @Fien111 we'd all die in 10 minutes
[2:51:54] <+patriotrenegade> @PeachSaliva You missed an Estus Flask shard
[2:51:57] <Lancaster_H> @Fien111 no thanks im cool being alive
[2:51:57] <Garthunox> Plague, in DS1 Mimics are only in the areas directly touching Anor Londo, so Sens Fortress, Anor Londo itself and the Archives, not counting the dlc that is
[2:52:00] <2fcd_twitch> They also climb up really slowly
[2:52:02] <LoneFonte> oh right, does paige know about weapon arts?
[2:52:04] <Zombrocom> Does plague like anyting?
[2:52:05] <SirKeigan> She missed an entire area
[2:52:09] <Fien111> @heatbugg Like paige
[2:52:11] <olaksi> read the room, the game
[2:52:14] <UlriktheSlayer1> @Zombrocom dark souls 1
[2:52:16] <SubjectX07x> @primaryfire Yeeeah honestly the OST is kinda nothing in its current state, the focus is very much the gameplay.
[2:52:16] <$heatbugg> ayyooo
[2:52:19] <$mckraven> I don't have any problem with the encounter. its fairly simple to manage lower level enemies
[2:52:27] <Laecerelius> He's also in a doorway which fucks up your ability to attack but of course NOT HIS!
[2:52:34] <primaryfire> @subjectx07x UH OH

[2:58:40] <+lazysaiyajin> Ptuber
[2:58:40] <Sloavon> so how late am I to the stream?
[2:58:45] <%T_Sasquatch> She's not beating vordt
[2:58:47] <sighphers> pat and plague should name their mentoring school for paige
[2:58:49] <%AncelDeLambert> about... two hours
[2:58:50] <%T_Sasquatch> I'll bet
[2:58:50] <+crustypunky> 3 hours late
[2:58:54] <Ris_Eltrut> @candycoatedconfection just close your eyes then
[2:58:55] <%optimasmaximas> LMAO just checked gamestop, only ps5 availability is the
[2:58:56] <Cory_the_Dinosaur> you missed nothing
[2:58:59] <coolguynickxx69> hey y'all. 3 hours in, so have they only been playing an hour?
[2:59:00] <%AncelDeLambert> but she's only been playing for close to an hour
[2:59:01] <+AtlasMcCoy> In 3 hours paige has made negative progress
[2:59:02] <%optimasmaximas> $850 bundle
[2:59:03] <CandyCoatedConfection> @t_sasquatch but the skybox is ugly.
[2:59:04] <L0CKE_C0LE> R2 to pee too
[2:59:05] <%superc37> very but shes still stuck at lothric so its whatever
[2:59:07] <MarylandJutsu> Pat is always part dead
[2:59:09] <lotharrio> Pat, talk about Star Trek's economy with Plague
[2:59:11] <%amymist> pat is withering
[2:59:11] <+patriotrenegade> @PeachSaliva She missed an Estus flask shard by the Tower bonfire
[2:59:21] <+rsg220> pat r u live?
[2:59:29] <%AncelDeLambert> I just hope she gets to Voidt
[2:59:29] <+TheotherKristian> Pat is in a constant state of "eh"
[2:59:33] <JetpackMcQuack> Pretend Pat isn't even there
[2:59:37] <chaosfrost462> Plauge save the stream by doing a letsplague of dark souls 3
[2:59:41] <$sumrand0> Chat can take care of itself. We know what to expect on Paige streams quiettHA
[2:59:47] <$SvenHolgersson> EXCEPT FOR POISE
[2:59:50] <$SvenHolgersson> GOD DAMN IT
[3:00:03] <+rsg220> rip armor
[3:00:04] <Djinnazz> i like that.
[3:00:06] <Aydarkzero> wait Paige was streaming!
[3:00:08] <danknugglit> It really makes you feel like spiderman
[3:00:13] <+TheotherKristian> Is the Cinder's mod worth it if I;ve only played the game through once?
[3:00:23] <+Deekman> Plague are you playing DeS?
[3:00:30] <+rsg220> fallen knight set was one of my favorites
[3:00:34] <SoySocks> @Deekman that's assuming he got a ps5
[3:00:36] <%T_Sasquatch> The game itself isn't striking color wise overall
[3:00:37] <Dao_Puppy> There's color?
[3:00:41] <+Mitchellsocks> I'm not a fan of the desaturated look of everything in the game
[3:00:48] <Fien111> Feed dog more
[3:00:50] <Helmed> poise and boss fights are the only bad thing about this game. i was the difference for me giving this game 300 hours, instead of just 100 hours danCry
[3:00:51] <MarylandJutsu> When did he STOP being fat and wrinkly
[3:00:52] <Old_tac0> show cam for dog
[3:00:55] <cintra212> You lose more distinctive designs but gain in more combination possibilities yea
[3:00:56] <+rsg220> I did find some of the character lighting pretty bad and wished it looked more natural like ds1
[3:00:57] <%T_Sasquatch> Like the screen right now is mostly BROWN
[3:00:58] <heartlesshealer> psaGiefrail <3
[3:01:00] <+AtlasMcCoy> Pat has like 6 ps5's he could probably give you one
[3:01:07] <@Jekado> would plague be able to play a ps5 game with all the downloading those games need these days?
[3:01:07] <$sumrand0> Appreciate the input Eli, I empathize with a lot of your criticisms of DS 3 I just find people don't contrast their complaints against their compliments so people assume the critic has no positive opinions about the game
[3:01:11] <Neo_Kaiser> The Remake designs are bad.
[3:01:11] <+Rutheniel> The colour tinting issue is very apparent with the armours they ported over from dark souls one
[3:01:12] <Fien111> PAIGE

[3:02:07] <$sumrand0> quiettHA quiettNoice u right

[3:02:57] <Fien111> Pat At Risk
[3:02:57] <@SoFarFetched> Is paige treating not eating on the bed YESTERDAY as "overwriting" a save.
[3:02:58] <Zombrocom> !Gastlighting!

[3:03:22] <%AncelDeLambert> she can get it later
[3:03:23] <+RushUnplugged> "slow and deliberate" DS1 kicks you out of firelink to 3 mobs at once, unless you bait them, it was never slow
[3:03:26] <+zamatermort> get ye flask
[3:03:28] <+Mitchellsocks> Under the slimey guy
[3:03:28] <%AncelDeLambert> she'll be back, whatevs
[3:03:29] <+Admiral_PopnFresh> You cannot get ye flask
[3:03:29] <$sumrand0> @sofarfetched Absolutely, Paige does NOT rotate her saves in life hahahaha
[3:03:37] <abelincoln_catpuncher> @peachsaliva the shard is down the tower with spear guy
[3:03:38] <+AtlasMcCoy> Paige's brain can't process information from more than a day ago
[3:03:49] <+DemonOfSalt> Congrats, you got her souls back.
[3:03:51] <mostundesired> LUL
[3:03:51] <+patriotrenegade> @PeachSaliva yeah, past the lothric spear knight
[3:03:53] <Xelhesia> LOL
[3:03:54] <MarylandJutsu> Used to be
[3:03:55] <%optimasmaximas> LUL
[3:03:55] <lotharrio> All those spiders keep eating her memories.
[3:03:56] <+Urgotfantasy> how... sweet?
[3:03:57] <Old_tac0> is paige going for big stronk build in this game
[3:03:57] <trianglehat> when?
[3:03:58] <KellBeII> feel like i would like 3 way more if more enemies didnt respawn
[3:03:58] <+AMagicalFlute> o o f LUL
[3:04:00] <+consistentlylistless> doubt
[3:04:01] <+JenovasPuppet> Aww Pat
[3:04:03] <SirKeigan> wha happun?
[3:04:03] <+BuriasDempsey> "Use to be"
[3:04:03] <+arancet> PAIGE YOU CHEATED THROUGH COLLEGE
[3:04:04] <@SoFarFetched> we need AU paige
[3:04:05] <DianaTheAscian> doubt
[3:04:06] <Djinnazz> that'll just make it worst
[3:04:07] <$rdark_ksu> key words "used to be"
[3:04:07] <2fcd_twitch> Don't say used to be
[3:04:07] <+Deekman> so many strokes
[3:04:08] <boomstickery> me too but chronic inflammation puts paid to that
[3:04:10] <+crustypunky> What if the clone is evul
[3:04:14] <filialpails> flowers for paigeron
[3:04:15] <Sunstalker> Really? Because you've told the math class stories, paige.
[3:04:16] <Djinnazz> Clones degrade the more you make.
[3:04:18] <Xelhesia> LIKE THOSE STREISAND DOGS
[3:04:19] <$sumrand0> Paige's brain does many "works" but none are actually helpful
[3:04:21] <+blademaster247> Remember when Paige's Elementary School Math teacher passed her out of pity
[3:04:25] <SirKeigan> proceeds to fight him anway
[3:04:27] <+patriotrenegade> Is that why you flunked math class?
[3:04:27] <2fcd_twitch> Why
[3:04:32] <Fien111> Paige needs to materialize via an old transporter buffer signal
[3:04:36] <%Keyd00d> Palpatine don't got a wife
[3:04:39] <leargo> the clone would deteriorate, truts me
[3:04:40] <JetpackMcQuack> pants this loser
[3:04:43] <Dhurkst> @superc37 Not even close. DS3 is the most desaturated by far. Dark Souls, and especially the original Demon's Souls, are packed with color, and even Bloodborne has some colorful parts.
[3:04:46] <+GinAndRoses> spinny lad
[3:04:47] <+zamatermort> Hes blinder than Paige
[3:04:47] <+Admiral_PopnFresh> let her rip
[3:04:50] <bleugh> maximum stealth
[3:04:51] <+patriotrenegade> Helmets dont have great peripheral vision
[3:05:04] <$sumrand0> Dark Souls plot is stupid over the course of the series
[3:05:10] <lotharrio> BUT THE BAAAAAAABY
[3:05:14] <+Derpprime> but the baby
[3:05:17] <$sumrand0> But DS isn't half as bad as Star Wars
[3:05:18] <boomstickery> he's a good boy Eli
[3:05:19] <Mechz71> BIG TRUE PLAGUE
[3:05:19] <$SinisterBroccoli> Might as well just take off the shield
[3:05:22] <hamster_eater> spin 2 win
[3:05:22] <Gallhint> based eli
[3:05:22] <%TigerCatGo> BUT BABY
[3:05:25] <+AtlasMcCoy> Plague is upset that other people have the capacity to love
[3:05:25] <$i_am_therydon> paige learn to attack after enemy attacks
[3:05:26] <+FlameLoneWolf> Pat is a dog mom
[3:05:26] <%augusta_wind> eli have you considered: he baby
[3:05:27] <Dao_Puppy> If Zangief were an actual human child I would have called the police weeks ago.
[3:05:31] <Sunstalker> We need to move her away from a shield, this is too bloodborne for her to use a shield
[3:05:36] <+BuriasDempsey> The baby
[3:05:37] <+mikehuntis4timmy> mikehuntis4timmy subscribed at Tier 1. 
[3:05:40] <+arancet> thank you plague
[3:05:40] <+Seitine> Just think about when they have a kid. LUL
[3:05:41] <+rsg220> plague did you ever have a favorite pet?
[3:05:41] <bleugh> paige pls
[3:05:41] <TurtlesAndTentacles> Sounds like hatin to me
[3:05:43] <Fien111> Also, Pat. How hard was it not to name him Iggy?
[3:05:43] <$SvenHolgersson> Pat would 100% get a "MY DOG IS SMARTER THAN YOUR HONOR STUDENT" car sticker
[3:05:49] <Mister_McDerp> give paige big two-handed weapon
[3:05:51] <Laecerelius> Paige hates attacking unless the enemy is hitting her
[3:05:53] <Helmed> this is like hololive where you cant talk about other vtubers until they do. now that plauge has talked shit about the dog. were allowed
[3:05:58] <councilmechanica> Pat tell Paige I sent her pictures of elmo‚Äôs sister weeks ago doing a big leggy stretch, I DM‚Äôd them to her on Twitter
[3:05:59] <+goodguydrew> Preach plague, preach!
[3:06:01] <Old_tac0> did paige get the greataxe for early game stronk
[3:06:01] <+Jrockoni> best thing about living in the country. people don't baby dogs.
[3:06:03] <+Mitchellsocks> Paige kill the old lady, she's EVIL!
[3:06:08] <%AncelDeLambert> Pat that's CINDERS
[3:06:31] <+cade_calrayn> Dogs deserve to be babied, they're such good beans
[3:06:43] <JetpackMcQuack> my life
[3:06:44] <Fien111> 4 hours
[3:06:49] <sighphers> how does plague treat his animal friends
[3:06:49] <$sumrand0> @mitchellsocks that's redudant Paige needs no excuse to kill ladies, evil or not she's just gotta eliminate the competition
[3:06:50] <+Urgotfantasy> dogs turn peoples brains into mush but I totally get it.
[3:07:06] <+Mitchellsocks> @sumrand0 Oh right, I forgot who i was watching
[3:07:07] <Dhurkst> @superc37 If a game were more desaturated than DS3, it would be borderline-grayscale.
[3:07:15] <+DemonOfSalt> gj
[3:07:18] <$sumrand0> @mitchellsocks quiettHA quiettHA quiettNoice
[3:07:31] <%Keyd00d> Don't forget the boyz
[3:07:31] <+Urgotfantasy> paige BIG
[3:07:34] <+AtlasMcCoy> big chop
[3:07:37] <Fien111> Plague is doing a service this stream and everyone should thank him
[3:07:46] <+rsg220> yes plague is a good
[3:07:51] <+cade_calrayn> my bf's dog singlehandedly pulled him out of a bipolar depressive state via cuddles and sleeping next to him, so that dog deserves all the love
[3:07:53] <+crustypunky> The jump part 2
[3:07:53] <%Keyd00d> LUL
[3:07:58] <%optimasmaximas> LUL
[3:08:02] <2fcd_twitch> I don't think that item is worth it
[3:08:05] <JetpackMcQuack> it's a trap
[3:08:07] <+FlameLoneWolf> LUL
[3:08:07] <BurdRightsActivist> drop your shield, perfect
[3:08:10] <%Keyd00d> he squat
[3:08:12] <BoxNavy> :(
[3:08:14] <+Mitchellsocks> i think it's a ring of sacrifice lmao
[3:08:16] <XzileGaming> does paige have tourettes now
[3:08:16] <+FlameLoneWolf> He clipped your head
[3:08:19] <+LiquidDinosaur> DRINK
[3:08:19] <+Rutheniel> It's a ring of sacrifice
[3:08:20] <%cylish> Blackfire bombs
[3:08:22] <+Rutheniel> ironically
[3:08:23] <Mikers29> Plague, when Cortez reached the new world he burned his boats to encourage his men. So leave the elevator
[3:08:25] <JetpackMcQuack> It's not worth it that's for sure LUL
[3:08:26] <DianaTheAscian> blackfire bombs
[3:08:27] <KellBeII> its just a ring of sacrifice
[3:08:27] <vinceshamwowslap> he got you by one pixel
[3:08:27] <+cade_calrayn> I think it's a ring?
[3:08:28] <$sumrand0> I know what it is: NOT WORTH IT
[3:08:31] <+rsg220> i remember way more items from in DS1 then any other games
[3:08:32] <%cylish> Its blackfirebombs
[3:08:33] <Srthunda> it is a ring of sacrifice
[3:08:37] <+patriotrenegade> @PeachSaliva The itemn you are trying to get is a a rare ring of sacrifice, its worth 2000 souls if you sell it
[3:08:48] <zeki177> she is alive ?
[3:08:53] <%superc37> @dhurkst well yeah it is. ds1's color pallete for most of the game was basically a greenish, greyish, yellow. with izalith being the exception bc of all the shitty blinding red and orange
[3:09:15] <Helmed> rsg220 thats another thing i hated in ds3. dark souls always had a big range of weapons you could get in the beginning. most basic weapons in ds3 are endgame for whatever reason
[3:09:21] <+LiquidDinosaur> who?
[3:09:23] <qu3kl41n_the_impure_king> Mahvel over
[3:09:28] <+LiquidDinosaur> change what?
[3:09:34] <MarylandJutsu> no elmo is peepee
[3:09:38] <Fien111> Fail
[3:09:42] <%superc37> what whatd it change?
[3:09:43] <+GinAndRoses> she do it
[3:09:45] <+twohitgood> illusory wall posted that on twitter
[3:09:46] <KellBeII> in the original game stockpile tomas' family items are on male corpses
[3:09:47] <+Rutheniel> "Patched to be more accurate" kinda sums up the Demon's Souls remake rather well
[3:09:55] <BoxNavy> that was the hardest jump on earth
[3:10:00] <+N0bdyNoOne> Because the puppy needs loving
[3:10:01] <mostundesired> Dogs can talk Season 2
[3:10:02] <+crustypunky> LUL
[3:10:03] <BoxNavy> DOGS CANT TALK
[3:10:04] <Fien111> Dog knows that Pat is dum
[3:10:06] <leargo> dogs know
[3:10:06] <Xelhesia> LOL
[3:10:07] <Finakala> The jump between rooves above this one is worse
[3:10:10] <BoxNavy> thats true
[3:10:10] <%walternatorz> he can cast spells
[3:10:12] <bettysharkface> Dogs can understand
[3:10:12] <+miguelrod777> lol true
[3:10:12] <Old_tac0> killing this guy isn't worth it
[3:10:14] <+LiquidDinosaur> @KellBeII why can't Stockpile Thomas be gay
[3:10:16] <%optimasmaximas> PLUNGE
[3:10:16] <JetpackMcQuack> Don't bully him
[3:10:18] <+AmanisHouseOfNonsense> Paige, stop tempting Crazy Talk
[3:10:19] <Srthunda> like a at stuck in a tree
[3:10:20] <coolguynickxx69> u also cannot reach him
[3:10:21] <+rsg220> @Helmed ds1 is also very comfy to play for me, just thinking about items to pick up which weapons I can optimally reach, all that doesn't exist for me in other games
[3:10:22] <+FlameLoneWolf> Dogs like it when you talk to them though
[3:10:22] <TurtlesAndTentacles> Plauge your super salt
[3:10:25] <%optimasmaximas> TAKE THE PLUNGE
[3:10:25] <+GinAndRoses> plunge on his ass
[3:10:25] <Xelhesia> DOGS TALK PLAGUE
[3:10:29] <BoxNavy> this is paiges downfall
[3:10:33] <Virokwet> plague need a pet to love
[3:10:50] <$LeRouch_the_Rebel> Do dogs understand when you give them the bird?
[3:10:50] <Fien111> No one knows
[3:10:53] <%superc37> god i wished they fixed satsuki so that he didnt look like a racist charicature of asian ppl. i also wish they would add the option to swap to the old voice acting and music.
[3:10:58] <%amymist> i think there actually is evidence to show that dogs typically like hearing their owners voice
[3:10:59] <+crustypunky> Paige doesn't even know
[3:11:01] <+CrookedSpiral> Dirty Work?
[3:11:02] <+Deekman> "Screwed" i think
[3:11:03] <MarylandJutsu> Pat is down there?
[3:11:04] <bettysharkface> Dog understands sit, and high five, and touch it, and here, and I gotta get up.
[3:11:04] <%walternatorz> Dirty Work came up in google
[3:11:06] <+EyeFarted> Dirty Work?
[3:11:10] <%amymist> even if they dont know what the words mean
[3:11:13] <BurdRightsActivist> fatevil
[3:11:15] <critiquequartz> Plauge *hates* dogs :(
[3:11:15] <Djinnazz> panicked.
[3:11:28] <SoySocks> Plague's thinking of Dirty Work
[3:11:35] <boomstickery> my jack russell communicates wiht me all the time, it gets annoying
[3:11:43] <JetpackMcQuack> use your new ring :)
[3:11:44] <+Seitine> Isn‚Äôt it that dogs understand our tones and expressions when have more than the words themselves?
[3:11:46] <+lwpabloelenano2hc> i find it wierd that a fury dont like a sertain animal...
[3:11:48] <+patriotrenegade> i like how when he swings you can see inside his model
[3:11:53] <loren_ipsuum> yey i made it to a live show
[3:11:57] <boomstickery> dogs understand both
[3:12:03] <devanmuse> I'm pretty sure my cat tries to meow my name regularly
[3:12:06] <+rsg220> can't wait for plague's mandalorian gripes video
[3:12:10] <%superc37> is this the lonfest anyones spent in lorhric at the start of the game?
[3:12:12] <2fcd_twitch> Not true actually
[3:12:13] <jimmytwofeet> WERES MY BOIVIN
[3:12:17] <%superc37> cuz it feels like it
[3:12:17] <JetpackMcQuack> LUL
[3:12:27] <BoxNavy> but why
[3:12:30] <+LiquidDinosaur> i dont like groups like this
[3:12:31] <Fien111> Paige never developed object permenance
[3:12:33] <+LiquidDinosaur> this is bloodborne shit
[3:12:36] <%walternatorz> REMEMBER
[3:12:39] <whitebatsy> BECAUSE GOLDFISH MEMORY
[3:12:39] <$rdark_ksu> dont ask for the impossible
[3:12:40] <+zamatermort> BECAUSE YOUR BRAIN IS BROKEN
[3:12:40] <SwindlerOfProgress> @patriotrenegade I noticed that, too LUL
[3:12:48] <Mister_McDerp> goldfish memory
[3:12:52] <@commanderclaw> If we healed Paige's brain she would turn into a smug asshole
[3:13:01] <+LiquidDinosaur> ROLL ONTO THE ROOF
[3:13:01] <+Gojibruh> yes
[3:13:05] <BakaSurvivah> unforgettable surprises
[3:13:05] <+patriotrenegade> Paige would stop dating PAt
[3:13:07] <%walternatorz> The damage is already done.
[3:13:08] <Dhurkst> @superc37 DS3 is just gray/gray-yellow, with splashes of dull orange from fire. DS1 is way more vibrant & varied.
[3:13:09] <2fcd_twitch> If you have the ring after you lost your souls it stops them from going away permenantly
[3:13:12] <Laecerelius> Plague‚Äôs life would be so much easier with fixed brain Paige
[3:13:17] <Fien111> "Thank god I dodged that bullet! OH, DOG!"
[3:13:18] <@Jekado> did she loose enough souls worth this?
[3:13:20] <+CapnClassix> What are going to school for, Paige?
[3:13:21] <+AmanisHouseOfNonsense> Dunno why, but laywer Paige sounds hilarious
[3:13:23] <%superc37> superc37 subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 42 months! ngl i kinda wish i had your memory so that i could experience everthing for the first time all the time
[3:13:29] <%walternatorz> Plague wouldn't know what to do with all his free time.
[3:13:31] <rytisone> but Paige was a lawyer in Ace Attorney
[3:13:33] <+cade_calrayn> in the ditch on the far side

[3:20:56] <+patriotrenegade> EVERYTHING
[3:20:56] <Aleate> otzConcern
[3:20:59] <CandyCoatedConfection> one thing I don't like is how stats and their new keep changing for every game
[3:21:06] <SirKeigan> this axe doesn't scale with stats
[3:21:11] <promessav2> no scale
[3:21:16] <Rhetco> dark axe doesnt scale with strength
[3:21:17] <+Seitine> lionDAE
[3:21:21] <%optimasmaximas> so were going himbo?
[3:21:23] <%optimasmaximas> great
[3:21:24] <cintra212> Her axe is dark infused Plague
[3:21:29] <Old_tac0> become more big stronk paige
[3:21:31] <AFlyingTaco1> Yeah this axe doesn't scale with any stats
[3:21:31] <Aleate> Wuh...
[3:21:34] <BoxNavy> do big
[3:21:38] <coreyyotto> she can just get a different weapon though
[3:21:39] <SirKeigan> fucking waste
[3:21:42] <promessav2> upgrade longsword then
[3:21:44] <$sumrand0> Gotta get her DKGS
[3:21:45] <$Quack_of_Dawn> ALWAYS strength with Paige
[3:21:48] <Rhetco> nah quality got nerfed to hell
[3:21:49] <KellBeII> strength builds eli
[3:21:54] <coreyyotto> meme dex builds
[3:21:57] <$sumrand0> Straight Sword Spam
[3:21:58] <BurdRightsActivist> Straightswords, that's it
[3:22:00] <TheoTTree> Quality builds are real nice but stay away from Quality infusions. They're real bad
[3:22:07] <TheGrimmHuntsman> Oh no, my greatest weakness! Dying!
[3:22:08] <2fcd_twitch> Quality is king in DS3
[3:22:08] <%bluetocho13> i have a good bleed build
[3:22:10] <%T_Sasquatch> Fuck meta. Fashion ONLY
[3:22:10] <Daniel_Is_I> Quality didn't get nerfed to hell, it's still the highest AR for 80% of the weapons
[3:22:13] <Old_tac0> get paige up to 32 strength for the greataxe lol
[3:22:14] <KellBeII> strength is the final meta both for pvp and pve
[3:22:21] <%Agami23> big fuck off axe.
[3:22:23] <LuLz_Emissary> any straightsword. buff it and you break the game
[3:22:25] <coreyyotto> cause the straighsword's moveset is just the cleaver's animations form bloodborne
[3:22:26] <+patriotrenegade> quality
[3:22:26] <$Quack_of_Dawn> Big Hammer did very well for my peanut brain here
[3:22:26] <+Mitchellsocks> PVE Meta is Sharp Sellsword Twinblades >>> God itself
[3:22:29] <+Rutheniel> 3s meta is either quality or glass cannon magic
[3:22:30] <TheoTTree> Heavy or Sharp infusion is better than Refined almost all the time
[3:22:30] <AFlyingTaco1> I mean you could use anything in PvE, couldn't you?
[3:22:31] <$sumrand0> Straight Sword Spam is PVE meta IIRC
[3:22:35] <BoxNavy> i forgot souls games even have a pvp meta
[3:22:35] <+TheFabledAble> demons was magic
[3:22:36] <$SinisterBroccoli> Demon's souls you can do anything
[3:22:37] <skyentombment> Boy it'll be fun to see peaches run around like a headless chicken until she finds a big sword
[3:22:41] <BoxNavy> i forgot there was pvp at all
[3:22:41] <+patriotrenegade> @PeachSaliva Farron Greatsword is easy mode
[3:22:44] <jimmytwofeet> Bleed builds are disgustingly good
[3:22:45] <Dakuu75> sharp Washing Pole, Dex build was my go-to
[3:22:46] <MarylandJutsu> when in doubt invest in ELMMMOO
[3:22:46] <SomeSageAdvice> the moment you get Havel's Shield, the rest of the game is a joke, it helped me beat the final DLC boss in one shot
[3:22:57] <+Mitchellsocks> Hallowslayer Greatsword is also very strong early
[3:22:57] <%T_Sasquatch> Personally I'd say Paige should choose a weapon type she likes
[3:22:59] <Shadope342> YEAH eli n paige antics again!
[3:23:01] <Djinnazz> pfff
[3:23:05] <+Rutheniel> Alternatively, DS3's meta is any twinned weapon
[3:23:13] <SubjectX07x> Personally a fan of Friede's scythe buuuut you ain't touchin that for... well probably ever because it's Paige.
[3:23:14] <+Mitchellsocks> But Sharp Sellsword is the highest dps by far, and is further buffable
[3:23:22] <CandyCoatedConfection> do Paige forget how to drop attack?
[3:23:25] <%Agami23> luck build with bleed would fuck dancer
[3:23:29] <CandyCoatedConfection> *did
[3:23:29] <+TheFabledAble> I really enjoyed my 125 faith/str build <3 it was so much fun
[3:23:30] <%optimasmaximas> paige is totally gonna summon dancer isnt she
[3:23:30] <$sumrand0> I wanna see Paige run the Farron Greatsword quiettNoice quiettNoice quiettNoice quiettNoice
[3:23:38] <+Rutheniel> And yeah, any of the infusions that still allow you to buff
[3:23:40] <AFlyingTaco1> I do remember Sharp Twin Sellsword dex builds being particularly strong
[3:23:41] <%bluetocho13> yeyeye love me some good bleed
[3:23:45] <promessav2> faith is good haha
[3:23:45] <+LensWander> What are some good quality scaling weapons?
[3:23:45] <$sumrand0> Aka Bloodborne Greatsword
[3:23:47] <cintra212> Great MAce is my fav weapon probs

[3:23:58] <deerlearning> -2
[3:24:04] <BurdRightsActivist> -2
[3:24:08] <+Rutheniel> Farron Greatsword is the meme weapon
[3:24:09] <JetpackMcQuack> gameattackWut
[3:24:11] <AMaidIndeed> WHY?
[3:24:14] <Dakuu75> big-crunch
[3:24:16] <SubjectX07x> Paige running the Farron greatsword might give her a stroke with its movement. @sumrand0
[3:24:17] <+Mitchellsocks> Guts sword is pretty poggers in this one, but she's already used it
[3:24:17] <Fien111> dogs love botlte
[3:24:25] <Lixagon> Vort great hammer

[3:37:04] <mostundesired> Why on earth would Pat answer on first try?
[3:37:05] <$arcielardor> He's turning into a gross dog thing
[3:37:08] <LuLz_Emissary> guess is half the fun LUL
[3:37:12] <mattatatatatatatat> FIRST TRY
[3:37:14] <Djinnazz> can she do it!
[3:37:16] <%Keyd00d> almost...
[3:37:16] <Djinnazz> nope
[3:37:18] <+Dives__> Close
[3:37:19] <+Rutheniel> I enjoy that Vordt does gain a full body hitbox when he swings around
[3:37:20] <JonKhan> Good try!
[3:37:20] <+tigerfang86> REALLY close
[3:37:20] <SoySocks> great first effort
[3:37:21] <RiverBirch> Good Job though!
[3:37:21] <skyentombment> YESSSSSSSSSSSSSS
[3:37:22] <+ygernesfeld> noooooooo
[3:37:22] <RiverBirch> GOOD JOB!
[3:37:22] <+Jaysky> Not aggressive enough
[3:37:23] <boomstickery> close
[3:37:23] <%walternatorz> good first attempt
[3:37:23] <JetpackMcQuack> Close one
[3:37:23] <+tigerfang86> Great try
[3:37:25] <+WhereIsWill> amazing 1st try
[3:37:25] <Old_tac0> she did really well for a first try
[3:37:25] <mostundesired> Good first try
[3:37:25] <+LandOfTheWay> @mattatatatatatatat you jinxed it
[3:37:26] <2fcd_twitch> Ember?
[3:37:26] <+ygernesfeld> so close tho
[3:37:26] <+DemonOfSalt> Good first go.
[3:37:26] <%AncelDeLambert> pretty close, shoulda healed
[3:37:26] <PartyFavors> Great first go!
[3:37:27] <%Agami23> i hate how his second form does a bunch of aoes
[3:37:28] <garbageheaphound> Good first try
[3:37:28] <RiverBirch> Honestly Good Job!
[3:37:29] <Rhetco> really close
[3:37:29] <AFlyingTaco1> That was a good goddamn first try, holy shit
[3:37:29] <XzileGaming> god fuck
[3:37:29] <Aleate> Very close, nice!
[3:37:29] <AlphaTauri> real close
[3:37:30] <%Keyd00d> You almost one shot that's amazing tbh
[3:37:33] <+cgreene64> Big strong
[3:37:34] <+zamatermort> Great try
[3:37:34] <+demon1103> not bad for first attempt
[3:37:34] <$sumrand0> ahh yes the "When DS bosses hit their second phase meme songs"
[3:37:36] <%chiazam> oh so close
[3:37:36] <+cdrom321> What is healing?
[3:37:46] <promessav2> there's like 8 things you could try
[3:37:47] <Laecerelius> She had no heals left
[3:37:48] <$thomassolorio> paige stay determined
[3:37:48] <clockworkidiot> I actually thought she got him
[3:37:50] <%Keyd00d> She was out of estus
[3:37:52] <%optimasmaximas> @Sir_Gawain_Lotsson might as well kill you tho cause the other boreal enemis get it on you and it makes em a bitch to fight
[3:37:56] <+Johnny_Treehouse> can't wait to go home and make a nice vordt
[3:38:00] <StealthlessFox> Vordt's hitbox in second phase is really bad, best to put him down and be done with it
[3:38:05] <+xendless_xurbia> I really don't like dark souls 3
[3:38:06] <+WhereIsWill> 2-3 phases
[3:38:08] <+cdrom321> @laecerelius Withdrawn.
[3:38:11] <+Sir_Gawain_Lotsson> @optimasmaximas correct. it might as well be Frenzy
[3:38:18] <+Rutheniel> Phase fatigue is a real thing
[3:38:19] <$sumrand0> Phase 1 LISTEN TO MY SONG Phase 2 OK NOW IMMA GIT U
[3:38:22] <SubjectX07x> And some are insanely dramatic shifts, especially in the DLC.
[3:38:23] <cjmk9> Listen to the beat or get beat
[3:38:23] <+McSoliace> Phases are cool but they can be a bit much
[3:38:28] <mostundesired> I don't mind phases, but give me one HP bar god damn.
[3:38:29] <TheoTTree> It's kinda weird, the phase-shift thing is great in some fights but it doesn't need to be in all of them in the precise same kind of manner
[3:38:34] <Srthunda> you can fall through the window instead
[3:38:34] <+Sir_Gawain_Lotsson> @optimasmaximas bottom line is is does NOT just fuck up your stamina
[3:38:35] <promessav2> Sif has the best shift
[3:38:36] <%Keyd00d> NIghtman
[3:38:36] <cjmk9> The music tells their attack pattern
[3:38:37] <+McSoliace> cough *sister bitch*
[3:38:43] <promessav2> he turns into a sad pathetic dog
[3:38:44] <$SinisterBroccoli> a lot of time in their "2nd phase" they either have less health or take more damage
[3:38:46] <+N0bdyNoOne> Nightmen?
[3:38:50] <+N0bdyNoOne> Do they fight the daymen?
[3:38:52] <IronGlorfindel> Emma drops a bonfire after she ded
[3:38:54] <+demon1103> the Dark Souls problem. people liked this? lets do it 50 more times!!!
[3:38:55] <%optimasmaximas> @Sir_Gawain_Lotsson god i WISH it only messed with stamina
[3:38:59] <@SoFarFetched> just like their parents
[3:39:00] <mattatatatatatatat> pat is also smelly
[3:39:03] <AFlyingTaco1> Oh man I got real scared that the elevator wasn't there for a sec9nd
[3:39:04] <BoxNavy> theyre both fat
[3:39:05] <sosuke5> just run for it
[3:39:05] <@SoFarFetched> continuing the legacy
[3:39:07] <vinceshamwowslap> eugeniLurk
[3:39:20] <%chiazam> You totally don't have to
[3:39:24] <+FlameLoneWolf> One smells like pee, the other smells like poop
[3:39:26] <promessav2> use shortcut pls
[3:39:32] <coolguynickxx69> hahahaaa
[3:39:35] <@SoFarFetched> yeah plague and paige are furries Kappa
[3:39:41] <$sumrand0> I enjoy the phase mechanic since it makes learning the fights easier, just wish there were some bosses that mixed it up with changes at 75% and/25% instead I think one or two did that but not in significance ways that i can remember
[3:39:42] <mattatatatatatatat> snow white? COS HES A DWARF
[3:40:00] <AFlyingTaco1> Crazy Talk never fails
[3:40:04] <sighphers> crazy talk
[3:40:04] <SubjectX07x> @McSoliace The cinders mod has something ridiculous in which you fight a 3 phased boss that is Ciaran, then at around 25% of her HP you fight Ornstein with Nameless King's moveset, then at 15% of his HP you fight Artorias with one of the Soul of Cinders movesets.
[3:40:17] <SubjectX07x> All while Gough shoots great arrows at you.
[3:40:19] <%Keyd00d> admire the ass
[3:40:23] <+StevorenoElcamino> I‚Äôm genuinely impressed shes remembering enemy placements well just then.
[3:40:26] <+N0bdyNoOne> Is page over levelled? She is doing chunks
[3:40:32] <AFlyingTaco1> @subjectx07x That sounds awful
[3:40:34] <+tigerfang86> his FROSTY FROSTY taint
[3:40:44] <+LiquidDinosaur> @SubjectX07x what is Ciaran's moveset
[3:40:52] <+rsg220> she has the deep battle axe from the mimic @N0bdyNoOne
[3:40:52] <Aleate> Nice!
[3:40:53] <RiverBirch> She got to his 2nd phase MUCH quicker
[3:40:55] <SubjectX07x> It replaces the Undead Champion in the Ashes of Ariandel DLC. @AFlyingTaco1
[3:40:56] <RiverBirch> so she's doing good!
[3:40:56] <+Sir_Gawain_Lotsson> good roll?
[3:40:56] <BoxNavy> sick
[3:41:01] <mattatatatatatatat> u gotta stab his taint
[3:41:03] <maxpasta> so is vordt a big monkey or just a big human that goes on all 4s
[3:41:06] <vinceshamwowslap> damn good roll
[3:41:09] <$sumrand0> DS 3 Final Boss was pretty awesome in concept & actual fight design terms IMO sure you can burn him down quickly with NPCs and friends but 1v1 it's a cool fight with interesting lore behind it
[3:41:23] <skyentombment> I WANNA SEE THIS BE A HATTRICK

[3:45:24] <maxpasta> Bort thammer
[3:45:25] <blue8moon> she gotta beat the next boss first
[3:45:27] <ChungusQuest> try the angel weapon?
[3:45:27] <@commanderclaw> The hammer is the best early game STR weapon
[3:45:32] <AFlyingTaco1> But you can get ready for it
[3:45:34] <coreyyotto> and poise is like a troll stat now too
[3:45:34] <promessav2> she could get great club
[3:45:35] <@commanderclaw> It carried me hard until like Ringed City
[3:45:37] <thebehatted> she does have the angle glaive
[3:45:38] <KellBeII> vordts hammer is a great strength weapon that you can effectively use the entire game
[3:45:47] <mostundesired> LUL
[3:45:52] <Emperor_Machinus> halberd?
[3:45:52] <primaryfire> borts hammer has a skill that activates poise but she probably won't be using that

[3:46:10] <chaosfrost462> ok rest of my trachea has been cleared I am not going to do a big die on stream
[3:46:11] <mostundesired> Boruto's dad's son's hammer.
[3:46:13] <%jsbrand115> ABORT HAMMER
[3:46:17] <Dakuu75> could just craft a raw-weapon and level that up. those are good for early game
[3:46:24] <coolguynickxx69> all hammers are abort hammers
[3:46:27] <JetpackMcQuack> The Hollowslayer sword is usually my next strength weapon
[3:46:27] <AFlyingTaco1> bunger bunger bunger

[3:53:32] <coolguynickxx69> america is having an undead problem
[3:53:33] <+tigerfang86> the fact that the universe just starts IMPLODING makes ds3 lore really cool to me

[3:54:14] <Aleate> psaGib
[3:54:19] <+TheFabledAble> @PeachSaliva there is a theory that the dark souls world is flat, and whenever the flame is relit, the previous region that was closest to the flame is pushed out to make room for what the flame creates. which eventually results in a bunch of important places just fucked and scrunched up like garbage on the edges of the world

[4:09:54] <KellBeII> the flamberge has a broken weapon art that does crazy damage
[4:09:56] <ahaegotrigger> okay killing a blacksmith in someone elses souls game is pretty fucked
[4:09:57] <Aleate> Time for Eli to absorb the Paige essence
[4:10:05] <+Hankovitch> i bet people are still trying to invade the O & S bonfire run in DS1...
[4:10:08] <+SickBangerzM9> paige only has skeleton porn
[4:10:23] <leargo> Eli is the boring unlcle
[4:10:23] <Neo_Kaiser> Who does Paige trust more, Pat or Plague?

[4:10:30] <+patriotrenegade> PAt, make her walk into the giant's arrows
[4:10:37] <maxpasta> god gamer
[4:10:41] <+SickBangerzM9> I wouldnt call eli boring. more untrustworthy
[4:10:47] <+Hankovitch> plague stresses her out less
[4:10:53] <promessav2> i get invaded in anor londo, ut that's because i killed gwynyvere
[4:10:55] <filialpails> bore my ass, uncle
[4:10:59] <+Prism_Wing> boring like the verb

[4:11:08] <Aleate> I'll boring your ass otzSip

[4:11:09] <+FlameLoneWolf> Paige is distressingly unboring
[4:11:14] <maxpasta> Borting however...
[4:11:21] <LuLz_Emissary> Kappa
[4:11:22] <%ClericOfSparda> Plague is the cool uncle everyone thinks is funny because he mocks everyone
[4:11:22] <+StevorenoElcamino> no they meant hes the uncle that‚Äôs INTO the act of BORING.
[4:11:23] <+Hankovitch> paige is distressing
[4:11:24] <ChungusQuest> she has a estus shard
[4:11:26] <+SickBangerzM9> 69 ehehe

[4:12:28] <%Agami23> enemies when backstabbed typically give you enough time when getting up to get off a charged r2
[4:12:28] <KaiserMario> GASP, Something Eli likes?! HOW?!
[4:12:31] <+trustycoyote> Paige is motivated now!
[4:12:32] <%chiazam> PYROMANCY
[4:12:40] <+Hankovitch> Eli is the uncle with the funny comic books that you only realize decades later were about sex and drugs
[4:12:40] <2fcd_twitch> Yet another kind NPC
[4:12:42] <+Jp3g95> Corn pops
[4:12:43] <+EyeFarted> HE ROMANCES THE PIES

[4:16:53] <skyentombment> YESSSSS
[4:16:55] <SuperVaderMan> the tracking LUL
[4:16:55] <+Rutheniel> The remake's fat official is a crime to humanity
[4:16:57] <Spudnacious_Dynasty> spam triggers during grab attacks
[4:16:57] <SoySocks> HA HA HA
[4:17:00] <+Hankovitch> PAIGE NO
[4:17:02] <+patriotrenegade> HAW HAW HAW
[4:17:06] <L0CKE_C0LE> Wait, they removed Fat Officials in the Remake?!
[4:17:07] <+fraillightning> hugs are nice
[4:17:08] <DracaenaLeaf> Fat Officials no longer exist? wat
[4:17:19] <%Agami23> they totally still exist. pat was fighting them on stream
[4:17:21] <blue8moon> They look very different now is all
[4:17:21] <+fraillightning> ipkSnug ipkHug
[4:17:22] <+axenred> dex hammer
[4:17:23] <BoxNavy> @L0CKE_C0LE changed the design
[4:17:24] <+Rutheniel> Their smile and optimism is gone
[4:17:26] <AFlyingTaco1> Spiked Mace I think
[4:17:26] <+axenred> spiked mace indeed
[4:17:26] <%AncelDeLambert> My master's curse!
[4:17:27] <Neo_Kaiser> Remake redesigned a lot of enemies and made them worse.
[4:17:29] <Old_tac0> Fat Officials were redesigned in the DeS Remaster
[4:17:30] <@SoFarFetched> @DracaenaLeaf they changed their design in the Remake
[4:17:30] <Dao_Puppy> Fat officials just now have weird exposed skin and boils, it's odd.
[4:17:30] <+patriotrenegade> Spiked Mace
[4:17:30] <+Axellogic> Fancy death mace
[4:17:31] <Ynkubus_> Fat Offocials exist but thyey needlessly change the look of them
[4:17:33] <Neo_Kaiser> The Flamelurker is no longer on fire
[4:17:39] <DracaenaLeaf> oh the smile parts, sure
[4:17:43] <seaechiowai> !uptime
[4:17:45] <+SickBangerzM9> bluepoint has a thing for making things as generic fantasy looking as possible
[4:17:45] <SpaceGuntank> man i always wanted that fucking mace but i never got it to fucking drop legit. i'm so salty
[4:17:49] <promessav2> you can get the fork too
[4:17:51] <L0CKE_C0LE> @Neo_Kaiser that sounds lame
[4:17:56] <BoxNavy> huh
[4:17:57] <Neo_Kaiser> The Monk was turned into a zombie for no reason.
[4:17:59] <JetpackMcQuack> It's just weird
[4:18:01] <Aleate> Its fine, time is convoluted
[4:18:03] <DracaenaLeaf> at least they still laugh and smile at times, but yeah
[4:18:07] <BoxNavy> :)
[4:18:08] <DazzlingFuhrer> @Ynkubus_ What do you mean? Bluebois would never needlessly ruin the design of something. :)
[4:18:31] <%CommanderSqueaks> I like the redesigns of DS...
[4:18:33] <+patriotrenegade> she has to go through Hodrick and the giant's arrow garden
[4:18:36] <+MayorRev> i'm going to bed
[4:18:40] <+MayorRev> goodnight
[4:18:40] <Neo_Kaiser> The children monks had dirt rubbed onto their robes, despite the lore stating that their robes are clean.
[4:18:47] <+Ultimate_Edge> They are also now just called officials, creating the joke that all of Bluepoint is fat LUL

[4:31:51] <DianaTheAscian> yes
[4:31:53] <AFlyingTaco1> claymore
[4:31:57] <Oxybe> Lately i've been a fan of the 100% fantasy Insect Glaive from MonHun.
[4:31:59] <ayruaeu> ivy Valentine's chain whip sword
[4:32:01] <%CommanderSqueaks> Guts DOES have a cool weapon.
[4:32:03] <wibbwobbler> can't go wrong with a cool lance
[4:32:08] <SpaceGuntank> and it also sounds like a frying pan whenever it hits anything
[4:32:08] <Garthunox> wait dragonslayer aint sharp?
[4:32:11] <+Rutheniel> I enjoy glaives
[4:32:12] <Gorgs7> give anyone a spear and put them up against a trained swordsman or mace wielder, the spear still wins like 75% of the time
[4:32:14] <NaturalGear> Lucerne my fav too
[4:32:18] <seaechiowai> a male pat being referred to as Patty is fucking with me on an existential level

[4:32:50] <%optimasmaximas> LUL
[4:32:57] <promessav2> and that's why it sucks that they made katanas to fight a spear guy in dr stone
[4:33:00] <L0CKE_C0LE> Ash's Chainsaw hand is the best
[4:33:06] <Aleate> ...
[4:33:06] <Dhurkst> @Garthunox "massive, thick, heavy, and far too rough. Indeed, it was like a heap of raw iron"

[4:33:09] <AFlyingTaco1> LUL LUL LUL
[4:33:09] <%CommanderSqueaks> @garthunox The blacksmith made it as a joke and never expected anyone to ever be strong enough to actually use it.

[4:33:41] <BoxNavy> it was too late
[4:33:51] <%CommanderSqueaks> It is like it is new!
[4:33:57] <ShichiNoBushi> What I heard about how Squall's gunblade is supposed to work is that the recoil of the bullet is supposed to shock through the blade. Almost like a crappy, primitive HF sword.
[4:33:58] <%optimasmaximas> i sympathize with tim rogers
[4:34:01] <%optimasmaximas> it sucks
[4:34:04] <mostundesired> STOP

[4:34:13] <Broken_Sonex> Guess Babo is dead. Wish unfulfilled.
[4:34:15] <Neo_Kaiser> That's what I have.
[4:34:16] <Gorgs7> I'm right up there, details come to me real easy, can't ever rewatch mystery movies
[4:34:16] <Dhurkst> @Garthunox plus, it's way too thick for an edge its size to be sharp. It's basically just a wedge
[4:34:22] <Neo_Kaiser> I have perfect memory
[4:34:23] <mostundesired> Let's try on these wonderful version goggles.
[4:34:23] <+realm_forge> This photo of Elmo looks stately as fuck
[4:34:29] <%CommanderSqueaks> "Remember."
[4:34:29] <mostundesired> Everything looks the same.
[4:34:30] <%optimasmaximas> paige...
[4:34:31] <Neo_Kaiser> I still remember the time Pat laughed at me.
[4:34:32] <+Derpprime> the professor X temple-hold
[4:34:33] <Aleate> Paige will never have to remember the time she ate poison
[4:34:37] <+rsg220> Paige is is having a....deadly premonition
[4:34:39] <%Ranryu692> I have ADHD memory problems, and I can only remember the bad, embarrassing things, so I'd much rather have his problem
[4:34:40] <Lycanthropic> women should bring back the bush
[4:34:41] <Djinnazz> Like Pooh Bear?
[4:34:42] <Neo_Kaiser> I also remember the time Pat yelled at me.
[4:34:45] <+trustycoyote> It's a mechnical queue, It's a real thing @PeachSaliva
[4:34:48] <%optimasmaximas> booooo @rsg220
[4:34:53] <+JenovasPuppet> Someone PLEASE draw Paige as Pooh!
[4:34:58] <+FlameLoneWolf> I'm terrible with names
[4:35:03] <+rsg220> @optimasmaximas :p
[4:35:07] <Garthunox> I know a bit of Berserk, and i knew that dragonslayer was a huge hunk of iron but i always thought it was at least sharp
[4:35:20] <+realm_forge> Winnie the Paige
[4:35:22] <%Agami23> my memory is either the best or the worst. like i can rewatch shows because i genuinely forget them. but fuck do i remember that summer where i played kingdom hearts 2 and stopped to look at fireflys outside
[4:35:28] <seaechiowai> yeah this actually works
[4:35:29] <ChungusQuest> massaging your head and forcefully willing yourself to think: that is the very epitome of brute smarts
[4:35:30] <+miguelrod777> white dragon
[4:35:33] <+cvp5127> like a pet
[4:35:33] <L0CKE_C0LE> Blue-Eyes White dragon
[4:35:37] <+trustycoyote> also another real ADHD tactic
[4:35:37] <%Ranryu692> I can remember full names much more easily than just first names
[4:35:42] <+CopperTucker> @PeachSaliva I am the same way. I can't remember names for shit
[4:35:51] <%CommanderSqueaks> @garthunox Even the name dragonslayer is a joke because the blacksmith thought none existed anymore, so what was the point of making a weapon that could kill one?
[4:35:51] <logoth_> blue eyes white jacket
[4:35:53] <+Ultimate_Edge> That‚Äôs why you adopt ‚Äúdude‚Äù meta and never require a name
[4:36:02] <$SinisterBroccoli> I'm so bad with pneumonic devices, they do not work for me
[4:36:10] <$SinisterBroccoli> I just have to brute force remember things
[4:36:16] <Aleate> "Just calm down LUL "
[4:36:21] <Gorgs7> @PeachSaliva but it's in big calming letters
[4:36:22] <seaechiowai> @ultimate_edge dood
[4:36:29] <Garthunox> and then grunbeld shows up, not a dragon necessarily but an apostle with the form of a dragon
[4:36:31] <L0CKE_C0LE> Better suggestion, scream "RUN FOR IT!"
[4:36:57] <%optimasmaximas> damn
[4:36:59] <+Ultimate_Edge> @seaechiowai dudz
[4:37:05] <%optimasmaximas> sorry paige glad youre getting better
