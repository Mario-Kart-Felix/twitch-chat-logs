[0:19:33] <plaguedoctor_syan> Rightfully so
[0:19:35] <TrashManJonesy> S T A R S
[0:19:35] <+MisterTylerrr> He is the most handsome
[0:19:45] <hewlettfan96> Nemesis!!! His design is still  intimidating even after 20 years
[0:19:49] <%ospreyworks> Lady D was too strong for the weak DBD players
[0:19:54] <@SoFarFetched> Dont think their bios are still out yet.
[0:19:55] <Zeif00> All his perks are ok
[0:20:07] <@SoFarFetched> level 3 is 7 seconds

[0:20:57] <%ospreyworks> I love how even Capcom just had to go, "yeah Resistance never took off. might as well chuck Nem and Jill into a better game."
[0:20:59] <hewlettfan96> It’s not fair your husbado is getting 1.1 grand followers
[0:21:03] <$JoshManVGH> I hope he yells "STARS!" when Hysteria triggers.
[0:21:03] <@SoFarFetched> and Oblivious is you don't hear the heartbeat when the killer is near.
[0:21:03] <$cade_calrayn> that's an lowercase Alpha, yeah, it's not an A
[0:21:05] <Zeif00> Oblivious = can't hear  terror radious

[0:22:09] <krewl123> f 1
[0:22:09] <@SoFarFetched> Its where the selection for killers is with the arrows
[0:22:14] <+patriotrenegade> So Pat was wrong and he's actually pretty good?
[0:22:15] <@SoFarFetched> but I don't think its there right now Paige cause I tried looking
[0:22:19] <+razielhex> STAAAAAAAAAAAAAAARS
[0:22:20] <+Prevot> his backstory is STAAAAARRRSSSS
[0:22:25] <+razielhex> Hah
[0:22:27] <hewlettfan96> What is nemesis exactly
[0:22:33] <$Sphincter_Spelunker> when is he not
[0:22:38] <leinadtonu> Pat?
[0:22:38] <@SoFarFetched> Nemesis is a Bio Weapon
[0:22:42] <+spodebroker> His backstory is he was Milla Jovovich's boyfriend.
[0:22:42] <$Sphincter_Spelunker> he a binch
[0:22:43] <@SoFarFetched> the ULTIMATE...BIO weapon
[0:22:44] <+patriotrenegade> Sometimes literally!
[0:22:46] <+Nitsorinni> The original mould
[0:22:50] <inorwise> he HATES resident evil
[0:22:51] <%Lunarhawk> Pat? BITCHING? I'm shocked! SHOCKED!
[0:22:52] <%theshillman> noooo, pat?? filled to the brim with poop?????
[0:22:53] <+razielhex> @hewlettfan96 A Tyrant
[0:22:55] <hewlettfan96> The original mold
[0:22:56] <udurbalanced> "Leon, you need to bang Claire"
[0:22:57] <plaguedoctor_syan> Typical Pat
[0:22:58] <Bail_Seven> so he's pat?
[0:23:00] <mr_saturday93> pat dum
[0:23:01] <blue8moon> pat would never
[0:23:02] <+MayorRev> He wants to build up blood points for the final build @PeachSaliva
[0:23:04] <%BurningLlama777> Pat jumped once with Nemesis and uninstalled the game.
[0:23:05] <krewl123> so it sounds like pat and in other news water is wet
[0:23:08] <inorwise> also nemmy is p strong
[0:23:10] <%Lunarhawk> Well, not that Shocked.
[0:23:10] <$JoshManVGH> Nemisis is his baby.
[0:23:11] <crimsonharvest> he loves it so much bitching was the only option he had
[0:23:16] <plaguedoctor_syan> Classic Pay
[0:23:21] <+spodebroker> He plays FortNite
[0:23:22] <plaguedoctor_syan> Pat*
[0:23:24] <Zeif00> He's just bitched cause he bad at killer
[0:23:25] <$JoshManVGH> He wants it to be as good as Pyramid Head.
[0:23:26] <$Sphincter_Spelunker> classic pay
[0:23:27] <dapperskeleton69> the killer should've been chris redfield, and he gets a damage buff against all male characters
[0:23:37] <NoHoldsBarredProductions> Instead he's playing a game that seems to be falling apart as he's playing it 😂
[0:23:39] <+waltzqueen> It probably can't live up to his Hopes and Dreams
[0:23:42] <%BentArcher> You'll never make it! Never ever make it! Don't you know you can't make it!? Weeeoooo
[0:23:43] <$cade_calrayn> He's just salty that they stole his idea for how Nemesis works
[0:23:46] <@SoFarFetched> "if he didn't have such a dumptruck of an ass..... " -Peachsaliva
[0:23:47] <skyentombment> OH GOD GUYS, SHE'S TURNED INTO ANGRIESTPAIGE
[0:23:49] <hewlettfan96> @razielhex Looks like a monster with a bad severe cleft palate
[0:23:51] <plaguedoctor_syan> He has Orb so we forgive him
[0:23:54] <Ell1ot> Paige is my hero
[0:23:59] <leinadtonu> Pat changed zombies for freakers...
[0:24:08] <+dpgoatman> did you know when he moris Jill he says S.T.A.R.S
[0:24:11] <@SoFarFetched> @hewlettfan96 its pretty much a human turned into a monster with science and stuff.
[0:24:11] <skyentombment> Is Pat gonna turn into PatSaliva?
[0:24:18] <LysdexicAndVolingit> Paige and Suzi stream when?
[0:24:18] <+NWR_James> @PeachSaliva Just deliberately butcher the lore and shame him into it
[0:24:28] <+razielhex> @hewlettfan96 Result of a Parasite called the NE-Alpha that was embedded T-Virus Tyrant Host.  So it made them cognitively aware.
[0:24:28] <$JoshManVGH> Zambos are NOT your friend, no matter how much of their Skeleton is exposed...
[0:24:29] <hewlettfan96> I figured @sofarfetched
[0:24:33] <MucousMembrain> Hello everyone
[0:24:34] <$Sphincter_Spelunker> I thought Tyrants were clones of some big dude
[0:24:36] <$cade_calrayn> AngriestPaige, isn't that her married name?
[0:24:36] <inorwise> yeah it does
[0:24:37] <Bail_Seven> yes
[0:24:39] <@SoFarFetched> not sure geefThink
[0:24:45] <krewl123> pagie did you get shocked when you started up the game and it gave you a shock by it saying the name of the game out loud it did for me
[0:24:46] <ashenfrenzy> it works if you heal yourself or others i think
[0:24:49] <inorwise> if its 3 people healing it doesnt though
[0:24:56] <@SoFarFetched> @Sphincter_Spelunker I forget the story on the tyrants so I could be wrong.
[0:25:06] <%BurningLlama777> Ha ha ha that's awesome
[0:25:20] <Bail_Seven> does test build use your same account?
[0:25:29] <@SoFarFetched> yeah same account
[0:25:35] <$Sphincter_Spelunker> @SoFarFetched I get my 2nd hand info from chat or wiki. I'm in the same boat
[0:25:40] <@SoFarFetched> the bloodpoints you use in PTB is not affected in your main game.
[0:25:42] <+razielhex> @Sphincter_Spelunker Right, but a Tyrant that had the Las Plagas parasite from RE4 created NEMESIS tyrants.
[0:26:19] <dapperskeleton69> *oh boy, more locker perks!*
[0:26:27] <%ClericOfSparda> That flashbang will likely become meta
[0:26:32] <krewl123> we get a firecracker for free so cool
[0:26:35] <$Sphincter_Spelunker> Who needs courage when you have a gun?
[0:26:36] <@SoFarFetched> @Sphincter_Spelunker yeah I haven't played all the games,especially like 5 and 6. So I just remember what I can from Pat's LP's LUL
[0:26:40] <Reanimator83> Lady Dimitrescu in DBD when...
[0:26:49] <@SoFarFetched> That ones helpful for people who get lost finding generators
[0:26:52] <+Calek> is an entire match called a trial
[0:26:53] <inorwise> this one is pretty bad sadly
[0:27:00] <krewl123> @Reanimator83 hopefully never
[0:27:05] <+razielhex> shout "Leon" like ther President's daughter
[0:27:07] <+xmetalicdemonx> but how is Jill's butt?
[0:27:25] <inorwise> counterforce is the noed destroyer so pog
[0:27:31] <dapperskeleton69> *oh boy, totem perks are worse!*
[0:27:38] <+waltzqueen> Nemmy has an addon called Jill's Sandwhich
[0:27:40] <@SoFarFetched> thats super helpful
[0:27:54] <@SoFarFetched> but it is a very "mmmm me" perk
[0:28:04] <Zeif00> Goodbye Ruin Undying
[0:28:04] <+waltzqueen> "I'll give you STARS"
[0:28:16] <@SoFarFetched> pretty much blinds the killer when they kick it LUL
[0:28:35] <dapperskeleton69> killers get buillied even harder, rip
[0:28:40] <Ell1ot> i forgot her last name was Valentine. I've been calling her Jill Sandwich.

[0:29:11] <+Nymphonomicon> Chill, Valentine.
[0:29:11] <krewl123> nenemiese has it for a add on
[0:29:14] <dapperskeleton69> isnt the sandwich for nemesis?
[0:29:22] <@SoFarFetched> No bloodpoints you use in the PTB doesnt affect your live BP
[0:29:28] <+MayorRev> ***
[0:29:29] <augusta_wind> Paige I started listening to My Dad Wrote a Porno because of you!! it’s a riot!!

[0:29:43] <+waltzqueen> let's see her items!
[0:29:49] <+Calek> they're different servers so I'd imagine they're separate
[0:29:49] <+archangel9889> So, the lore of this game is they are all in purgatory right?
[0:29:58] <udurbalanced> @PeachSaliva I've been a fan since your reading of Greer's manifesto.  Would you come back sometime for a dramatic reading with Rackets?
[0:30:00] <@SoFarFetched> and yeah there is an item Nemesis has called "Jill's Sandwich"
[0:30:04] <mythrilcrafter> I wonder if Jill ever goes by Jillian
[0:30:15] <Zeif00> PTB is totally separate, spend away
[0:30:20] <%ClericOfSparda> Oh man, I'm so salty. I just had a DBD match where a survivor was helping the killer. Reported both of them, but still salty
[0:30:24] <%ChrisPlaysThing> I'm having such a hard time staying quiet about my investments to family and friends
[0:30:39] <@SoFarFetched> @archangel9889 yeah pretty much the killers/survivors gets pulled into the Entity's realm where the survivors are forever trying to escape,while the killers have to keep sacrificing for the Entity.
[0:30:57] <Reanimator83> I'm still holding out hope for "The Tall Man" from Phantasm in DBD NotLikeThis
[0:30:59] <@SoFarFetched> nah you're fine paige
[0:31:08] <@SoFarFetched> also I can't believe Paige didn't believe me geefCry

[0:43:33] <dots4eyes> Will this be...Jill's last escape? Let's find out.
[0:43:36] <%ChrisPlaysThing> alright, shlorp the juice o nthe jenny and get it going
[0:43:37] <%BurningLlama777> Really the Entity should invest in some wind-powered generators.  I mean really.
[0:43:46] <@SoFarFetched> I mean you just don't get certain advantages that perks do. Like perks give bonuses/auras and such for things.
[0:43:52] <atgithursdays> HOW EMBARESSING

[0:45:09] <+HefestoForges> baddy daddy
[0:45:09] <hairtoday> BIG CHUNGUS

[0:45:19] <@SoFarFetched> I like how the infection is blue
[0:45:25] <inorwise> Nemmys chase music is sooooo goooood
[0:45:29] <%nyxing_it_up> this guy is kinda like plague meets pyramid head

[0:45:56] <@SoFarFetched> Its like with Plague,you don't *have* to heal
[0:45:59] <Noahccountingfortaste> think Plague, he is WAY better when you are infected
[0:46:02] <PinoProxie> my own clone
[0:46:06] <that_grumpy_panda_guy> I wonder when they will give Nemisis a Chris skin. lol jk
[0:46:07] <$TheNewZealandStory> vaccines just give you an extra health state against his tentacle, other than that they arent a big deal
[0:46:09] <@SoFarFetched> But zombies WILL smack you down in a hit
[0:46:11] <@SoFarFetched> when infected
[0:46:12] <%nyxing_it_up> there are limited heals too. they dont respwan like plague
[0:46:12] <TournamentArc> Paige, imagine if you or Pat's streams got featured in the streamer highlights at the event. Woulda been hilarious
[0:46:13] <Reanimator83> 6 feet Paige
[0:46:14] <Sperbus> Why is it blue? Are you cyber-infected?
[0:46:17] <+HefestoForges> close
[0:46:26] <@SoFarFetched> And yeah vaccines are not infinite,there's only a limited amount
[0:46:30] <+HefestoForges> JUKED
[0:46:32] <dots4eyes> Big tentacle claw
[0:46:40] <%ChrisPlaysThing> wow those UI updates are solid
[0:46:42] <@SoFarFetched> So you don't want to always heal y ourself from the Virus
[0:46:42] <$Sphincter_Spelunker> what was the plan
[0:46:43] <inorwise> TIIIITSS
[0:46:47] <emoonimoo> Starrrrrrrrrrs
[0:46:52] <$NitronStreams> Basement of shame
[0:46:55] <%CommanderSqueaks> Nemesis is dragging you to your optometrist appointment.
[0:46:55] <benjiFG> haaaaaa
[0:46:59] <%nyxing_it_up> i like that the Nemesis sickness mimics the Resi health meter
[0:47:03] <PinoProxie> head empty
[0:47:05] <+razielhex> oooh that clipping is...something else
[0:47:08] <skyboundnero> paige's plan is to win with pure power
[0:47:12] <%theshillman> the distress call of the Paigeis Americanus
[0:47:25] <@SoFarFetched> Im still glad this isn't mashing the spacebar anymore
[0:47:31] <+razielhex> jill and jill
[0:47:32] <+cactusplasma> are the VAs for Jill and Leon the same as their game VAs?
[0:47:39] <%CommanderSqueaks> Wait, is that blue goop supposed to be Nemesis blood?
[0:47:58] <%BurningLlama777> Ooh, AI zombies
[0:47:58] <Noahccountingfortaste> damn those zombies are THREATENING
[0:47:59] <inorwise> why isnt pat playing with you, is he a coward?
[0:48:03] <%nyxing_it_up> its t-virus apparently
[0:48:12] <%CommanderSqueaks> @inorwise He just finished a Days Gone stream
[0:48:12] <Ozavic> @inorwise He's streaming
[0:48:14] <@Jekado> the zombies can be threatening or useless is what i heard its pretty RNG
[0:48:19] <CappuccinoGuil> so, like they put Jill and Leon in the game with no guns?
[0:48:21] <%CommanderSqueaks> Oh wait, he still is streaming
[0:48:28] <$TheNewZealandStory> does paige know what a loop is
[0:48:35] <Noahccountingfortaste> I love his punches too
[0:48:38] <%sumrand0> I paused Korone to watch u Paige, hope you appreciate what that means! lol
[0:48:38] <%ChrisPlaysThing> Man he has so much range
[0:48:39] <Reanimator83> Playing this with a controller is even worse
[0:48:40] <@SoFarFetched> its finnnne its fine
[0:48:48] <@Jekado> He's also pretty fast
[0:48:54] <atgithursdays> And you are a fun person, Paige!
[0:48:55] <dots4eyes> The way he shoves you onto that hook
[0:48:59] <@SoFarFetched> Froot Loops
[0:49:07] <@Jekado> Can i get some LOOPS brother
[0:49:12] <+MayorRev> I was totally convinced leon would have a gun
[0:49:13] <inorwise> i noticed your doing a lot better in chases since last i watched
[0:49:14] <%ChrisPlaysThing> His increased range probably throws off the normal loop training
[0:49:15] <%theshillman> LÖÖPS
[0:49:20] <Sperbus> When do you get the rocket launcher
[0:49:21] <%CommanderSqueaks> Lööööööps

[0:50:00] <$cade_calrayn> All of her loops went into her lupus
[0:50:05] <@SoFarFetched> Also go use that blood on Leon,Jill has enough on her.
[0:50:09] <NoHoldsBarredProductions> Peach! Stay determined...
[0:50:15] <Zeif00> Love Lithe
[0:50:15] <%sumrand0> omg @commandersqueaks amazing
[0:50:26] <Noahccountingfortaste> inner strength might be good with that totem perk too
[0:50:33] <CappuccinoGuil> It feels really weird seeing Jill and Leon running around from these monsters instead of shooting them
[0:50:34] <%ClericOfSparda> Is resurgence that good? It seems... not bad, but not great.
[0:50:39] <@SoFarFetched> you can still change it paige
[0:50:39] <%AncelDeLambert> hey Paige Pat says your butt smells and you smell like butt

[0:51:21] <+NWR_James> butt should smell like butt. that's science
[0:51:23] <atgithursdays> Good butt smell or bad butt smell?
[0:51:26] <CappuccinoGuil> don't we all smell of butt? we have butts, after all
[0:51:27] <mythrilcrafter> Maybe Pat likes stinky butts?
[0:51:33] <%ospreyworks> please tell me Jill has a "master of unlocking" perk
[0:51:35] <@SoFarFetched> Paige sometimes just thinks about that DumpTruck geefStare
[0:51:35] <%AncelDeLambert> LUL
[0:51:39] <%ChrisPlaysThing> Pat loves butt smell, it's why he must spread it all all times
[0:51:39] <%ClericOfSparda> He's petting the dog right now, so he probably smells like dog.
[0:51:41] <devanmuse> What's a butt supposed to smell like? Lavender?
[0:51:41] <%CommanderSqueaks> What is a GOOD butt smell?
[0:51:43] <+Fooguwu> the sexual butt smell
[0:51:43] <%AncelDeLambert> I have arrived and already created discord

[0:51:48] <Zeif00> Poop comes from the butt
[0:51:50] <atgithursdays> If butt is fresh out the shower then it smells like a good butt smell
[0:51:54] <@SoFarFetched> @ospreyworks no unlocking perk cause there's nothing much to unlock in the game.
[0:51:55] <%sumrand0> zoomers
[0:51:56] <%CommanderSqueaks> @Fooguwu explain yourself
[0:52:00] <%theshillman> is pat just two hamsteaks in pajama pants with a ginger head perched on top?
[0:52:00] <udurbalanced> Pat hates RE but loves DMC, which was originally an RE game.
[0:52:03] <%AncelDeLambert> LUL LUL
[0:52:06] <OldOnyx> I dont know this game super well. Why does paige keep stopping to run toward the big threatening killer man for a sec?

[0:52:26] <@SoFarFetched> you suck on that butt bone
[0:52:27] <+NWR_James> They HAD butts
[0:52:28] <%ChrisPlaysThing> Butt shouldn't smell if it hasn't been occupied with poop recently

[1:01:32] <inorwise> nemmy is bugged rn actually which might be what hes talking about

[1:01:50] <+MisterTylerrr> Either a:  He's not perfect, so that means he sucks.  or B: I'm bad at him, so he sucks.
[1:01:50] <Grandma_Amari> Silly Paige, horses can't play hockey, they can't hold the stick Kappa
[1:01:50] <Noahccountingfortaste> @inorwise oh? bugged how?
[1:01:51] <%BurningLlama777> Oh no Jill's covered in blueberry jam.
[1:01:52] <$JoshManVGH> Whats with Nemisis and the blue goo?
[1:01:59] <$cade_calrayn> Paige, it's obvious, he's jealous that Nemesis is so tall
[1:02:04] <+MayorRev> whats that blue border?
[1:02:08] <Zeif00> could heal up w/ a totem
[1:02:09] <PartyFavors> Nemesis feels strong but dull to play as honestly. Like the zombies and vaccines make him cooler to play against as survivor. That's just an outside perspective though.
[1:02:16] <@SoFarFetched> the blue is they are infected with the virus
[1:02:16] <OldOnyx> nemmy sucked until pat  said said something. blame crazy talk
[1:02:18] <Sotetsu> I wish zombies were in every map for every killer. They are so fun, and make it so I have to pay so much more attention to my surroundings
[1:02:25] <Noahccountingfortaste> @MayorRev she's infected, so zombies and Nemesis's whip can down her
[1:02:27] <$JoshManVGH> Ahh.
[1:02:31] <+MayorRev> oh dear
[1:02:36] <+MayorRev> can you cure it?
[1:02:37] <dots4eyes> That looks like a trap
[1:02:42] <Noahccountingfortaste> yes, if she finds a vaccine
[1:02:52] <+Alaster101> where face cam paige
[1:02:53] <inorwise> @inorwise his first infection with his tenticle is meant to hinder(slow) you, but it just gives you a speed boost like normal
[1:03:11] <+3d_pbandj> Oh no, Jill's infected! just like in that one game...Zombies ate my neighbors!
[1:03:14] <Noahccountingfortaste> oh, wow, I didn't notice

[1:08:09] <PinoProxie> because he has to let the shit out, the shit must flow
[1:08:09] <+ArcanumArcanum> Because Pat is dumb and wasn't using perks and didn't learn the power

[1:26:58] <@SoFarFetched> yeah whenever you got free time
[1:27:00] <+Soliloquy123> Remember that kill he has in 3make where he presses the rocket launcher right up to Jill and fires? Would've made a great mori

[1:41:41] <bob900000> does cheating ever happen
[1:41:43] <+Taisuru> GGEZ isn't worth reporting but it is smelly
[1:41:45] <MyNameIsRasus> reporting is for n pass users only

[1:43:03] <%sumrand0> @sofarfetched looks r important
[1:43:19] <%CommanderSqueaks> Peach clearly has never looked at @ScrubQuotes
[1:43:22] <+king_of_beggars> The game looks a lot better than it usually does when Paige streams it. Has it gotten a patch recently or something, or is it just the lighting?
[1:43:27] <%ComfortableStranger> camping is a legitimate  strategy !
[1:43:28] <+king_of_beggars> Because I do like this daytime lighting.
[1:43:30] <+0ctopus666> i hope they add a claire skin
[1:43:33] <%BurningLlama777> It's a haydy hole
[1:43:53] <T_Sasquatch> Who cares about fun. Im here to PrideShrug  WIN
[1:43:54] <+necrocannibal2> I mean, if camping is so effective that's mostly the game's fault
[1:43:55] <+Soliloquy123> @king_of_beggars They've been visually updating older maps. This was the most recent
[1:43:56] <$Agami23> i think my favorite way to play killer is myers with scratched mirror
[1:43:58] <burncoat> What's paige's opinion on the Trickster?
[1:43:58] <MyNameIsRasus> i want a mod that switches mr x for chris
[1:44:02] <+necrocannibal2> some people will always play to win
[1:44:06] <+tennodoomtor> I remember how shit the lighting and low quality the graphics looked
[1:44:19] <%BurningLlama777> "MY SELF WORTH IS TIED TO THIS GAME MEANT FOR FUN"
[1:44:21] <$hrbeck_> @necrocannibal2 it’s not effective, it’s just boring
[1:44:23] <porkued> cow tools
[1:44:29] <+king_of_beggars> Yeah it looks really nice. I actually like this aesthetic better than the dark and spooky night corn.
[1:44:39] <+bugz_munny> I will drop the occasional "sugma nuts" at the end of a good match

[1:57:49] <BoxNavy> monkaS
[1:57:53] <balthazar758> @burningllama777 "guyyyyyzzzz"
[1:57:58] <$cade_calrayn> Paige you're going to post it on Twitter and the entire internet is going to scream

[1:59:10] <$hrbeck_> I miss when Paige was alive and had eyes
[1:59:10] <%BurningLlama777> There's kind of a mild smell of burning plastic, nbd
[1:59:23] <$cade_calrayn> Has Eli or Pat yelled at you about it?
[1:59:23] <+ah_clif> you sound like I did talking about my acute gastritis and taking like 5 medicines
[1:59:23] <AyotoCorp> Is Paige going to eat battery acid next
[1:59:40] <burncoat> I hear zambie
[1:59:44] <+ah_clif> it's not bad yet, but my fever is gone at least
[1:59:46] <@Jekado> get your flashbang is why
[1:59:46] <+necrocannibal2> is it just me or is Leon run animation weird? lol
[1:59:48] <%sumrand0> wonder if we're gunna hear it explode before the stream cuts out..........
[1:59:51] <+ah_clif> stomach still hurts
[2:00:00] <%ComfortableStranger> Paige, plz tell me you use a coolpad with that laptop :O

[2:01:26] <$hrbeck_> 6 sets of eyes and batteries
[2:01:28] <PartyFavors> just need practice
[2:01:29] <+thotbane> look she had to test it to see how it works
[2:01:33] <burncoat> The flashbang having a delay is weird
[2:02:35] <placeholder03> is this the actual layout of the RPD?
[2:03:03] <@Jekado> somewhat
[2:03:10] <@Jekado> its very simular but there are some slight changes?
[2:03:16] <@Jekado> thats what the devs said at least

[2:06:35] <+thotbane> yeah what does being infected do to you
[2:06:36] <%ComfortableStranger> playing a Jill is Jilling
[2:06:40] <%theshillman> what does that do though?
[2:06:49] <NireFuster> @necrocannibal2 I'm assuming it's some sort of debilitating state or something, maybe it makes you run slower or something
[2:06:53] <$Dotta5> being infected means you got the covids
[2:06:57] <@Jekado> something like that
[2:07:00] <$Agami23> causes coughing that makes you easier to find and makes you slower on a few things like goign through windows
[2:07:01] <%sumrand0> amazing
[2:07:02] <@Jekado> also you can bleed out on the ground
[2:07:03] <Valdorick> lewd

[2:07:32] <@Jekado> Terrible virus
[2:07:46] <$Dotta5> G-Fuel? more like T-Fuel
[2:07:49] <+necrocannibal2> @PeachSaliva what does being infected mean tho? do you run slower or something
[2:07:49] <bob900000> yes
[2:07:51] <NireFuster> Oh speaking of Resident Evil, have you played Village peach?
[2:07:52] <$Agami23> yeah tyrant
[2:07:57] <+Taisuru> Tickle Virus
[2:08:09] <%maskofmichael> T off these Nuts!
[2:08:13] <+necrocannibal2> oooh
[2:08:13] <$Agami23> the tyrant virus is way cooler than the G "golgotha" virus
[2:08:14] <Zeif00> slugging? DansGame
[2:08:15] <+lynlyn_ow> oh it's like plague
[2:08:23] <$hrbeck_> The v stand for “very bad”, i is “I wouldn’t want to have it”,...
[2:08:24] <anAngryHamster> The G in G-virus stands for Gyrant
[2:08:30] <phantalime> Thicc Virus
[2:08:39] <@Jekado> Suzi is thinking about streaming DbD now because of this
[2:08:51] <%ClericOfSparda> So he won, Nemesis is just dragging this out
[2:08:52] <+Taisuru> I love suzy but her vids don't do nearly enough on the lore IMO
[2:09:16] <Zeif00> Dude really wants his 4k
[2:09:18] <+TopTieramisu> aaaaaaaaaaaa
[2:09:23] <%Prism_Wing> Thass a big boi
[2:09:25] <+necrocannibal2> tbf RE lore is mostly really dumb
[2:09:25] <graemecrackers2> Big strong man <3
[2:09:26] <+Taisuru> (She's spariing people from spoilers I understand)
[2:09:39] <NeroInfinite> on to the zombie hook you go.
[2:09:41] <burncoat> In first person, Nemesis puts survivors on the hook head first
[2:09:43] <+Taisuru> @necrocannibal2 Yes but I live for that kinda shit you see
[2:09:45] <@SoFarFetched> I was TRYING to say bye geefPoint
[2:09:55] <%ClericOfSparda> Suzy's videos lean more toward development than lore. I like it tho because I barely know dev
[2:10:03] <@SoFarFetched> but he snatched you
[2:10:09] <%sumrand0> gg
[2:10:09] <placeholder03> Ethan could survive that hook
[2:10:14] <+UltimortalMoth> Are you having fun
[2:10:32] <+TopTieramisu> it helps that ethan has 3 arms
[2:10:34] <+Taisuru> Ethan would be able to unhook himself
[2:10:34] <+SWFanatic> you did it
[2:10:35] <DrkJP520> Is there a story reason the survivors can't talk?
[2:10:36] <+necrocannibal2> I just learned that the T-Virus vaccine is called Daylight
[2:10:49] <Zeif00> swf w/ Suzi would be fun
[2:10:50] <@SoFarFetched> sorry I mean he snatched ME
[2:10:57] <%Prism_Wing> Ash can talk 😗
[2:10:57] <@SoFarFetched> before I was trying to say bye to you on hook
[2:10:59] <@SoFarFetched> geefCry
[2:11:00] <+UltimortalMoth> @DrkJP520 No but Ash says groovy
[2:11:06] <Valdorick> Nightmare hell
[2:11:07] <$Agami23> the entity is a dickhead
[2:11:24] <Valdorick> and screaming!
[2:11:24] <%Prism_Wing> also t bagging
[2:11:25] <+necrocannibal2> no entity could stop Ash from calling things groovy
[2:11:27] <Valdorick> painfully
[2:11:27] <+thotbane> why would they talk they ned to be quiet
[2:11:38] <+Taisuru> WHAT NOW?
[2:11:38] <+NickNackProductions> survivors don't speak because so they don't give away their location
[2:11:39] <%maskofmichael> Ash is special, that dick
[2:11:39] <+thotbane> he says "thank you" in Korean iirc
[2:11:42] <burncoat> nemesis should say "stars"
[2:11:51] <+Mekhet09> Ashley better say LEON when she comes out.
[2:11:57] <+waltzqueen> Nemmy says STARS when he kills Jill
[2:11:58] <%Prism_Wing> @burncoatrapscallion he does when you mori jill :)
[2:11:58] <+SWFanatic> good night
[2:12:00] <$Agami23> in my mind they can talk, but not to each other only themselves. because the entity hates communication.
[2:12:01] <$AzureGale> Thanks for stream
[2:12:02] <+thotbane> and Plague talks all the time! Just in ancient Babylonian that nobody actually understands
