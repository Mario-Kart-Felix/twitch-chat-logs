[0:01:26] <+thegreenbenis> @plagueofgripes Yo
[0:01:30] <%maenos2> @anceldelambert I think she's ready, she wants to avoid ds2 dlc that badly
[0:01:35] <+Nordguy> Is Peach flying solo for this? it's podcast day
[0:01:37] <%remainprofane> Awh thanks!

[0:01:43] <+Scevda> sup, who has died today?
[0:01:47] <%remainprofane> she would never
[0:01:53] <%VashyronM> Isn't the DLC the best part of DS2, or am I misremembering?
[0:01:55] <%augusta_wind> wow I’m proud of Paige
[0:01:59] <+Bailey__gaming> WHAT ?,.,. 3 peach streams in a month who are you and what have u done with Paige.?
[0:01:59] <DatAsuna> Imagine skipping the DLC but insisting on chariot
[0:02:00] <AmericanaRed> WAAA WAAA WAAA shibuy4Kirby2
[0:02:00] <nimu290> hi peach
[0:02:07] <DatAsuna> @VashyronM it toally is
[0:02:12] <%oda_flobunaga> DLC is the only part of DS 2 worth playing
[0:02:13] <%laserbeaming> @VashyronM the DLC zones are excellent
[0:02:16] <%AncelDeLambert> it's supposed to be the best part, but by the time you get there you're so done with DS2 that it doesn't really matter
[0:02:19] <%VashyronM> That's what I thought.
[0:02:23] <DatAsuna> nobody ask how are you
[0:02:24] <BlindGato> Too bad we'll never see a DLC run
[0:02:30] <+Bailey__gaming> Hi guys <3
[0:02:43] <%laserbeaming> Such a shame that you have to go through the base game Zones to get to the DLC
[0:02:45] <%AncelDeLambert> Hey Paige, how are'ya?
[0:02:51] <Psych_man13_13> Man, and I was sad we weren’t going to get darklurker
[0:02:57] <nimu290> also how are you today?
[0:03:04] <devanmuse> @peachsaliva how are you today?
[0:03:07] <%Draylle> howdy chat KonCha

[0:03:25] <+NWR_James> I'd ask how Paige is but that might be rude
[0:03:32] <+Bailey__gaming> hi @draylle hope all is well psaGib
[0:03:33] <ashenfrenzy> oh damn, not doing DLC then
[0:03:34] <Frade> Paige is alive, oh shit
[0:03:36] <%AncelDeLambert> ah shit, new RLM
[0:03:39] <wishiwasadinosaur> Maybe she'll come back to the dlc after ds3... possibly
[0:03:39] <%AncelDeLambert> I didn't even know
[0:03:40] <PanicSwytch> Hey Paige How are u doing?
[0:03:42] <%laserbeaming> She's not doing the Giant Memories or Vendrick either. One of those Giant Souls is a pain in the butt to get
[0:03:44] <cureneckbeard> everyone asks "how is paige", but nobody asks "who's talking"
[0:03:44] <%AncelDeLambert> welp, that'll be for after the stream
[0:03:52] <rafaelba93> i love ds2, base and dlc
[0:03:52] <%augusta_wind> I think I’ll have some wine while I watch this stream
[0:03:52] <DatAsuna> @oda_flobunaga except you can do the DLC forever sgo she even accidentally enterred one of them
[0:03:52] <$Arazien> This is the most animated I have ever seen the stream!
[0:03:53] <cureneckbeard> put gief in the title card
[0:03:58] <EuropanLamprey> Watch Paige one shot the boss and the rest of the stream is fall guys
[0:04:03] <+worldbrand> But why is paige?
[0:04:03] <+SodiumPatrol> is the stream starting or ending?
[0:04:04] <%JD_Lars> New RLM? Guess I know what I’m watching after this
[0:04:04] <%theluckyhero> theluckyhero subscribed with Twitch Prime. They've subscribed for 3 months, currently on a 1 month streak! buh
[0:04:05] <Daisuke89> YEYEYEYE
[0:04:06] <%AncelDeLambert> Paige has played enough of DS2 to get the important references in DS3
[0:04:11] <PanicSwytch> Does anyone want to small talk?
[0:04:14] <Daisuke89> we finishing dark souls 2 today!!
[0:04:16] <SlingPlaysGames> I honestly used to hate ds2 but now ill do a run through every now and again and appreciate the build variety and some cool locations. Not what I wanted but u can't bring myself to hate it
[0:04:19] <Daisuke89> Haleluiah!
[0:04:24] <DatAsuna> @SodiumPatrol starting
[0:04:28] <+SodiumPatrol> ty
[0:04:33] <+Bailey__gaming> But BABA?!?!
[0:04:36] <BallerSwagBro9k> But can she handle DS3 faster more aggressive combat tho?
[0:04:42] <%linSP> I hope Paige gets the fat lady armor
[0:04:44] <Psych_man13_13> I hate how little ds2 gets in 3
[0:04:44] <cipher758> hello today
[0:04:53] <%oda_flobunaga> I played Dark Souls 2 after 1 and 3, it was so not worth it.
[0:04:58] <%mikessdd> didn't paige beat bloodborne?
[0:04:59] <Daisuke89> im playing condemned 2 while watching this stream and my heart is already torn apart by a friend that I confessed to and she dont even care :D
[0:05:00] <JobbedBone> No. and thats why it will be great
[0:05:06] <BallerSwagBro9k> @psych_man13_13 did u play the mod?
[0:05:14] <MarylandJutsu> how far is paige again/
[0:05:18] <%laserbeaming> @SlingPlaysGames I can conjure hatred for DS2 just by thinking of Iron Keep
[0:05:21] <Psych_man13_13> No, not yet
[0:05:23] <Daisuke89> shes fighting nashandra @MarylandJutsu
[0:05:29] <MarylandJutsu> Oh damn already
[0:05:31] <MarylandJutsu> allrighty
[0:05:31] <BallerSwagBro9k> Paige was healthier when she beat BB tho
[0:05:32] <%thejimjamz> HELLO TODAY
[0:05:33] <MarylandJutsu> we almost there
[0:05:35] <%augusta_wind> I’ve never played a Dark Souls game, which means all of my experience with DS has been through Paige playing it
[0:05:36] <+DeadlyPeaks> Did Paige change her mind on doing the dlc?
[0:05:38] <%remainprofane> woah what
[0:05:46] <+logoth_> dlc blowz
[0:05:48] <PanicSwytch> I think she's skipping the dlc
[0:05:48] <%remainprofane> I thought she was way behind that
[0:05:51] <wishiwasadinosaur> My favorite theory is that Wolnir is the main character from ds2
[0:05:53] <rafaelba93> iron keep was pvp zone, so i love it lol
[0:05:54] <MarylandJutsu> we also weren't in a quarentine in bb
[0:05:56] <%FacetiousAF> is it true?!
[0:05:56] <BallerSwagBro9k> Hopefully she OTKO Nash and plays more Fall Guys
[0:05:58] <Daisuke89> dlc will take her too long, think she will just finish DS2 and move onto DS3
[0:06:01] <Daisuke89> gogogogoggo
[0:06:01] <%thiccholaskappa> oh shit i'm gonna pog
[0:06:02] <MarylandJutsu> IT IS TIME

[0:06:15] <+WutangchickeN> SHE REMEMBERED TO PRESS THE BUTTON OH GOD
[0:06:17] <%remainprofane> Yoooooo
[0:06:18] <+PlatinumRevol> platin85LETSGOO platin85LETSGOO platin85LETSGOO
[0:06:20] <JobbedBone> Powerstancing was a great idea that added tons of depth to potential builds. Its a shame it was abandoned
[0:06:22] <+Bailey__gaming> hey @ballerswagbro9k <3
[0:06:23] <%mikessdd> So the prevailing theory is she was more powerful when she did BB?
[0:06:30] <AmericanaRed> COPYRIGHT NotLikeThis NotLikeThis
[0:06:32] <%AncelDeLambert> Here we gooooooooooo
[0:06:34] <Daisuke89> omg this song.. I was trying to remember where its from. now i know
[0:06:36] <MarylandJutsu> @mikessdd yes
[0:06:46] <Pojoh25> what am I watching ? jadeyanhWeird
[0:06:49] <BallerSwagBro9k> @bailey__gaming hey
[0:06:50] <%mikessdd> @MarylandJutsu Makes sense just checking
[0:06:59] <Pojoh25> actually the remix of Mario 64 is actually great
[0:06:59] <MyNameIsRasus> Yeah, Powerstancing really should have become a staple. It's such a rad concept.
[0:07:03] <Thirtine> wooo
[0:07:04] <MarylandJutsu> @mikessdd also the world wasn't all quarentined
[0:07:07] <%BoxNavy> SourPls
[0:07:19] <+Bailey__gaming> psaGiefrail psaGiefrail psaGiefrail psaGiefrail
[0:07:24] <MarylandJutsu> Also paige is taking care of two babies these days
[0:07:24] <EuropanLamprey> I think she just favors aggression over caution, DS3 should be easier for her
[0:07:28] <MarylandJutsu> Gief and Elmo
[0:07:28] <%remainprofane> twinblade build when
[0:07:31] <%thejimjamz> Reminder: Chariot is the undisputed champion until dethroned
[0:07:34] <+TheBigO75> Do y'all think fanfiction reading will ever make a comeback?
[0:07:38] <%mikessdd> @MarylandJutsu yeah being stuck at home definitely taxes the mind
[0:07:42] <peachy996> Yeah DS3 will agree with her more
[0:07:54] <%thiccholaskappa> chariot souls 2 Pog
[0:08:10] <MarylandJutsu> oh yeah DS3 has more of a BB agressive playstyle encuraged
[0:08:10] <%remainprofane> now we face the true enemy
[0:08:12] <%AncelDeLambert> I've attempted to play DS2 like three times, I still have no clue wtf powerstancing is or how it works
[0:08:14] <%remainprofane> chariot
[0:08:14] <peachy996> Looking forward to her fight Midir in 2023
[0:08:18] <SlingPlaysGames> where is she at right now? I almost never catch streams
[0:08:22] <+Bailey__gaming> BagOfMemes
[0:08:25] <MarylandJutsu> oh god midir
[0:08:35] <%remainprofane> supposedly it’s a special move set if you’re dual wielding two weapons
[0:08:35] <MarylandJutsu> @SlingPlaysGames apparenlty we are at Nashandra
[0:08:35] <%AncelDeLambert> @SlingPlaysGames end game, she has the Queen and the chariot to beat
[0:08:38] <JobbedBone> fanfiction never left our hearts.
[0:08:39] <SirKeigan> YE YE YE
[0:08:43] <%remainprofane> I think I have played in a long time
[0:08:45] <cosmicgoatee> 3 IN A ROW
[0:08:49] <%oda_flobunaga> But the tips fedora dragon is cool though
[0:08:55] <+chiazamformerlymankeyfigh> Paige? On a Monday?
[0:08:59] <cosmicgoatee> What blursed timeline is this Paige
[0:09:00] <lazerscraper> DLC?
[0:09:00] <%AncelDeLambert> knowing Paige she'll beat both bosses in ten minutes
[0:09:01] <BigNerdSam> mrfeel1Himikodab mrfeel1Himikodab mrfeel1Himikodab mrfeel1Himikodab mrfeel1Himikodab mrfeel1Himikodab mrfeel1Himikodab mrfeel1Himikodab mrfeel1Himikodab mrfeel1Himikodab mrfeel1Himikodab mrfeel1Himikodab mrfeel1Himikodab mrfeel1Himikodab

[0:09:06] <+WhereIsWill> psaDab psaDab psaDab
[0:09:07] <+chiazamformerlymankeyfigh> What sorcery is this?
[0:09:11] <PanicSwytch> She did 3 streams last week. She caught up really fast
[0:09:14] <%its_just_whatever_dude> sipsipDab sipsipDab sipsipDab sipsipDab
[0:09:15] <EuropanLamprey> If you are not powerstancing with the Flynn ring and Blade ring, you are playing DS2 suboptimally
[0:09:18] <MarylandJutsu> LEVE 2 TRAIN
[0:09:24] <cosmicgoatee> inb4 Chariot crying LUL
[0:09:30] <SirKeigan> No Vendrick, just Nashandra
[0:09:30] <%Skelegroove> Powerstancing gives you a unique moveset if you dual wield the same weapon type with 50% increase over stat requirement
[0:09:36] <peachy996> The general level flow of DS3 is more livelier than DS2 imo
[0:09:42] <%thiccholaskappa> she'll accidentally beat the final boss in 15 minutes then go into podcast saliva for the rest of the stream
[0:09:44] <MarylandJutsu> @SirKeigan but whut about chariot pog
[0:09:44] <+Bailey__gaming> I wish there was archives of all the fanfiction readings they were some of the biggest laughs, they only exist in small fragments
[0:09:48] <SirKeigan> Chariot is dead to her
[0:09:52] <%Idziman> Idziman subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 45 months, currently on a 45 month streak! Answer me this riddle, "If two witches watched two watches, which witch would watch which watch"
[0:09:54] <Ell1ot> Paige! i don't have my Wendy's yet!
[0:09:54] <+chiazamformerlymankeyfigh> I really don't want her to get tired too quick, but I'm really happy she's streaming
[0:10:22] <+PleasantLee> finale? she said finale right? how is that even possible
[0:10:37] <JobbedBone> the cool part about power stancing was it didn't have to be exactly the same weapon. so the moveset permutations were insane
[0:10:39] <+mMayrro> it only took 40 years...
[0:10:42] <SirKeigan> I really hope they surprise us with Dark Souls 3 right after. It's super easy to get started in and the faster combat will work better for her
[0:10:42] <+chiazamformerlymankeyfigh> Wait finale?
[0:10:53] <%mikessdd> Yeah shes not doing the dlc peeps
[0:10:53] <%augusta_wind> the idea that we'll actually finish Dark Souls today is crazy
[0:10:58] <Reanimator83> More than 1 stream in a month... ok I'm getting worried Kappa
[0:11:00] <Garthunox> RELEASE US
[0:11:00] <SirKeigan> We skipped a lot though
[0:11:03] <+Bailey__gaming> I love you all and I'm proud of her for getting here
[0:11:04] <%patriotrenegade> She better kill every enemy in DaS3.
[0:11:09] <+mMayrro> who knows she might explode right before the final boss
[0:11:17] <MarylandJutsu> well DS3 is more of a paige friendly game
[0:11:18] <SirKeigan> PeachSaliva vs Midir. God that's gonna be fucking awesome
[0:11:21] <%thejimjamz> Will paige be Venti starbucks deep today? We can only hope
[0:11:25] <EuropanLamprey> Powerstancing twin daggers with flynnROB actually made Daggers, good, not just viable but actually good
[0:11:34] <Mudstone12> if she does the dlc impromptu, i bope she never does the optional ones
[0:11:34] <+Fooguwu> ya paige is gonna like dks3 way more, kinda glad she's moving on in the end

[0:11:48] <Prevot> hope she plays something else instead of immediately starting DS3 and taking 2 years to get through it...
[0:11:51] <+Fooguwu> Paige? Labor? Gregoranante?!?!?
[0:11:55] <@Calek> power stance fume ultra greatswords was a fun playthrough

[0:33:11] <$DensityD> wow epic troll
[0:33:12] <JobbedBone> SAYING SORRY ISN'T ALWAYS AN APOLOGY, ITS AN EXPRESSION OF CONDOLENCE
[0:33:13] <%thejimjamz> She's screaming with tears in her eyes I WAS JUST PRETENDING
[0:33:15] <+SickBangerzM9> merely pretending
[0:33:17] <%nofestu2> it's just a joke
[0:33:18] <SoySocks> HA TWAS A JEST
[0:33:21] <$Arazien> That tweet is the most famous that asshat will EVER BE
[0:33:22] <%maenos2> i hear "how are you" at work so much and i always go "good, you?" without even thinking. like bitch (that lady whoc omplained not you), if i can say it again and again after having a stroke, you can say it too
[0:33:22] <+TimesApex> Merely pretending to be a fool
[0:33:23] <%QueequegTheater> @XeroSigmaPrime I believe you, but it's statistically unlikely
[0:33:23] <+SickBangerzM9> Hi Paige what are you?
[0:33:25] <Ianrazz> Haha I was just pretending to be a dumbass
[0:33:25] <SirKeigan> Her stream last night was full of people asking "how are you". It was awesome
[0:33:28] <%Promessa_EX> what about "How are you? good, how are you?" and nothing in response
[0:33:29] <@commanderclaw> Just lie and say you're happy
[0:33:29] <cureneckbeard> Hey, I think your dick is dirty. nyannKIMOI Try ending the game, and cleaning your dick nyannAngry

[0:33:42] <+Ne1son> That lady clearly doesn't understand midwest interactions, "how are you" is like 90% of my daily conversation
[0:33:44] <+worldbrand> a friend of mine goes with "hey what's good?" to avoid the "but what if things are bad" problem
[0:33:44] <Ianrazz> Erhhh

[0:33:53] <Laecerelius> The eternal answer to the question of "How are you?" is always "I'm fine!"
[0:33:53] <BallerSwagBro9k> BUT U JUST SAID IT THO
[0:33:53] <%Nekros4442> The real answer is to T-pose for dominance

[1:10:50] <Bigyanno> Shoulda said it in French
[1:10:54] <AxelCezar> A women saying "eat my ass" to a man is not an offence... bitterAyy
[1:10:55] <+buttdirt> was he a frenchie
[1:10:55] <skrewarrior> you have a very flow chart brain
[1:11:00] <Finakala> Honestly the Black Phantom in front of this boss is way harder than the actual boss, but she did that
[1:11:01] <stabbityrabbit> That's not Canada. That's asshole.
[1:11:02] <smartiger117> LUL
[1:11:05] <TheStrongBanana> why don't you pretended to eat my whole ass!
[1:11:05] <%Breakfast_Megapowers> Breakfast_Megapowers subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 33 months! Hey there Big Paige, how's the baby, Elmo and Zangief doing? Oh snap, sorry if you hate me asking how you are doing.
[1:11:11] <%walternatorz> there are pockets of backwards america in canada
[1:11:11] <californaya> That's an old people thing, I think
[1:11:11] <+Fooguwu> it's because canadians have no constant fear of being shot
[1:11:13] <%Sphincter_Spelunker> @AxelCezar Feel the same, don't know why she wanted to start rushing last stream
[1:11:14] <Meekest> Its ok that old man is dead now
[1:11:18] <PrettyThickandStrongDyck> "gasp how dare you insult me after i threaten your dog!"
[1:11:19] <%PomegranateKing> I am a god, you are my subjects
[1:11:20] <%superc37> oh yeah the run to him sucks ASS. especially when theres a spot that SHOULD have a ladder shortcut doesnt for whatever reason.
[1:11:26] <+Deekman> Love stream your next do walk
[1:11:27] <SirKeigan> Use an Effigy ever 5 or so deaths. You could use the extra 1/5 of HP
[1:11:29] <+Deekman> Live
[1:11:29] <aximeck> There was a really sad and angry man that lived near me when I was in junior high and he had a history of disappearing neighbours animals
[1:11:33] <KaiserMario> It's not canadians, it's just old white people
[1:11:33] <%theamazingroberto> on the plus side this boss run will get a lot faster pretty soon
[1:11:38] <aximeck> And there were like police warnings about him and shit
[1:11:40] <+Hick12> Don’t blame all of Canada for some shitheel in Montreal.

[1:12:08] <AxelCezar> @Sphincter_Spelunker right? after year long game, one could take 10 minutes to see the great DLCs, the base game is trash compared to those themed dungeons and bosses
[1:12:12] <%superc37> hey remember when the montreal subbreddit banned english
[1:12:20] <%PomegranateKing> PomegranateKing gifted a Tier 1 sub to rajathene! They have given 15 Gift Subs in the channel! 
[1:12:23] <%MyNameIsRasus> @superc37 i member
[1:12:28] <fairore> @superc37 they did what ?
[1:12:32] <%superc37> YUP
[1:12:37] <$zyberion626> @superc37 wasn't that a prank for 100k subs?
[1:12:37] <%superc37> look it up
[1:12:39] <+YelloGek> I would say the trick is to avoid staying in any of those little side-cubbyhole for too long. That skele-pressure is real.
[1:12:39] <californaya> @PomegranateKing I don't even know how to reply properly, lol
[1:12:40] <+Deekman> @aximeck same here! Lots of crazy here

[1:12:56] <%rajathene> @PomegranateKing Thanks for the gift sub! Such generosity!
[1:13:00] <%PomegranateKing> PomegranateKing gifted a Tier 1 sub to californaya! They have given 16 Gift Subs in the channel!

[1:13:16] <%king_wragles> Gonna buy that dog a book?!
[1:13:16] <ape_hawk> No one in the Pat/Paige household is smart
[1:13:18] <bleugh> tfw too intelligent to learn tricks
[1:13:18] <Finakala> Yeah it bugs me somewhat that she's going out of her way MULTIPLE STREAMS to kill Chariot, but not even going to try the DLC
[1:13:18] <+chiazamformerlymankeyfigh> S-So are we really finale tonight?

[1:56:55] <+Shadicara> But can Zangief complete dark souls?
[1:56:56] <mainmanjonadiah> M for Madden
[1:56:57] <super_robo_mg> because mouse and keyboard players are handicapped so they need help
[1:56:57] <+Solid_Stro> lytWIPED
[1:57:00] <UlriktheSlayer1> i think its because the devs didnt know how to make a souls game
[1:57:04] <DracaenaLeaf> Because it stands for Block
[1:57:05] <Owkono> the old Madden technique
[1:57:07] <%Sphincter_Spelunker> M for More blocking
[1:57:07] <DracaenaLeaf> 'em
[1:57:07] <+TDotGoat> Now Zangeif needs to learn to drop his shield
[1:57:07] <thesugardaddy111> cuz dark souls 2 dumb

[1:57:30] <+ArtoriasTheTrenchfighter> If it inverts the block button so it unblocks when you press, then for shield reliant builds, it could be useful?

[2:01:24] <%oda_flobunaga> Does anyone else remember the Green and Purple Catsup thing grom like 15 yrs ago?
[2:01:24] <spicystarbursts> pauge's BRB thing needs an Zangeif update
[2:01:27] <%ConflagrationsGaming> it was purple in my memory for some reason
[2:01:27] <thesugardaddy111> paige is a drug goblin
[2:01:37] <%Kenzo2000> They had purple too
[2:01:41] <+thegreenbenis> @Plagueofgripes Hey Eli.
[2:01:46] <+LeaIsChill> I left on BRB 15 minutes ago, what happened?
[2:01:46] <+Jaysky> I just remember it coming out when they had the wildberry poptarts
[2:01:54] <+RealThiele> paige will eat mold with a fox, paige will eat mold in a box, paige will eat mold here or there, paige will eat mold anywhere
[2:02:02] <%cloakofashes> @Garthunox Yeah, she beat chariot. Now Nashandra is new chariot.
[2:02:15] <%Kenzo2000> Paige is her own chariot
[2:02:15] <%ConflagrationsGaming> I remember the green mustard/purple ketchup in alignment with SHREK PROMOTIONALS? For some reason
[2:02:22] <%ConflagrationsGaming> i'll always associate it with shrek though
[2:02:22] <Coystick> New Chariot, same as the old Chariot
[2:02:31] <%oda_flobunaga> Paige will eat mold off an ass, Paige will eat mold off some glass
[2:02:35] <+Jaysky> It was because of Shrek?
[2:02:35] <thesugardaddy111> shrek mustard
[2:02:36] <spicystarbursts> Try to convince paige to avoid nashandra and push her to do a DLC instead
[2:02:42] <SpaceGuntank> shiiiit i left for 5 minutes and we're at BRB, did paige finally beat the game?

[2:03:02] <+Jaysky> @SpaceGuntank You overestimate her abilities
[2:03:06] <%augusta_wind> paige thinks sweet potato fries are gross, but slap some mold on there and she's all over them
[2:03:18] <+RealThiele> BAM
[2:03:21] <Crimpson> @SpaceCatStation Gave Nashandra like a few times and went AFK again
[2:03:22] <Mysnion> is it just me or does this boss seem pretty simple?
[2:03:27] <%oda_flobunaga> Imagine the shitshow of Paige vs the first tiger encounter
[2:03:29] <aximeck> Question: Is the alternate ending to DS2 exclusive to Scholar of the First Sin?
[2:03:31] <+Jaysky> It's very simple Mysnion
[2:03:37] <thesugardaddy111> paige will not be able to beat fume, calling it now itd gonna be like the sans fight where pat has to do it
[2:03:38] <%cloakofashes> Honestly, there's a chance Paige would somehow one-shot Fume, but get horribly stuck on, like... someone else.
[2:03:45] <spicystarbursts> this Boss is unbelievably simple
[2:03:47] <Profmcstevie> It's insulting simple, block and hit orbs
[2:03:55] <AFlyingTaco1> What boss is she on?

[2:04:06] <%ConflagrationsGaming> she's on Nashandra @AFlyingTaco1
[2:04:10] <+Jaysky> I'd go as far as saying this boss is one of the easiest in the game, and it's the supposed final boss of the original game
[2:04:16] <darklurker_dumahiem> OH NO THIS CRUSTY __ IS GoNNA DS 2
[2:04:20] <+PlatinumRevol> Has been 10 mins now. Called it Kappa
