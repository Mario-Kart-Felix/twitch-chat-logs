[0:59:07] <Dragon_Batman> I just realized if she goes for an ultra greatsword she will have a nightmare of a time
[0:59:07] <%DeadpanSoupcan> they cut all the content that mattered with this
[0:59:07] <%kiiiirsten> WHAT'S THAT SMELL
[0:59:08] <+YumoNikki> Took a good look, Paige... it's all a ruse. Nothing but disappointment from here on in.
[0:59:08] <carrion_king_> I always forget just how pretty this intro is
[0:59:09] <Nanomachiner> IM HERE FOR THIS!!!
[0:59:10] <OwlLightningMage> This intro made more sense when the game was actually about time travel

[0:59:14] <JustAnotherMuffin> @Moave No I think it pretty arguable that they give you some Family that you lost. Most likely a wife and child.
[0:59:15] <GreyFoxHoundDD> I wish this kind of shit was more in the game
[0:59:16] <coke_monster> God I want a Berserk adaptation.

[1:01:46] <+AlchemiBeast> remember paige: on, off, hit, drink

[1:01:47] <MicrotonalMatt> Pregagnancy is just another player inside you
[1:01:47] <+mh9s> double fisting
[1:01:49] <%stovetopism> parrying is for wimps anyway. Who need to parry when you have two giant ass swords?
[1:01:49] <+El_Tacobandito> double fisting
[1:01:49] <axelcezar> remember AGILITY ALWAYS UP sweet Inv. frames

[1:02:06] <Drag0n92> "can I die?" YES
[1:02:07] <%kiiiirsten> Coward
[1:02:07] <$TeraMercier> I always thought the ui in this game looked pretty nice
[1:02:08] <Bogart4321> can i fall in a darksouls game?
[1:02:09] <InugamiTheHound> Paige is into double fisting
[1:02:09] <Run44forrest> YEYEYE
[1:02:09] <%ThePuddingDead> i cant WAIT to see her react to falling damage
[1:02:10] <$jobbedbone> theres a secret down there
[1:02:10] <JimJamr> Is this her first time playing Dark Souls 2?
[1:02:11] <+Sebenoth> but does she know what you mean!?
[1:02:12] <redsynod> Double axehandle style
[1:02:12] <@SSaryn> 2 handing your fists is one of those things that's just really fucking stupid but somehow really effective
[1:02:12] <$Cavumentum> Nothing but ax handles
[1:02:13] <EASrake> oh yeah bad poise time
[1:02:14] <OwlLightningMage> Falling is the final boss
[1:02:16] <+Estuko> @PeachSaliva 'know what I mean?
[1:02:17] <weissguard> @PeachSaliva So for Pat, is the Steam version of Scholar stable?
[1:02:19] <%theslippybrit> no! you must suffer for us more
[1:02:20] <OwlLightningMage> No
[1:02:20] <mrvidicus> One of my favorite things about this game is the way all the armor fucking looks. It flows and blends with the model so well.
[1:02:21] <Sphincter_Spelunker> perfect
[1:02:23] <serra255> yes
[1:02:25] <arcaderabbit48> Paige, we just talked about how much you're going to die. Of course you can fell
[1:02:26] <$TeraMercier> It's Paige's first time
[1:02:26] <kindashagg> doggo time
[1:02:26] <magnumursusgames> oh my jesus yes
[1:02:26] <+patriotrenegade> She‚Äôs lost
[1:02:26] <%psychodave1234> i legit inhaled out of nervousness sO HARD
[1:02:29] <+Jaysky> "Can I die in a silly way in a game that's tagline is usually prepare to die?... Maybe."
[1:02:29] <Rare_SK> Yeah! Just back down!
[1:02:29] <zamzoph> @PeachSaliva Can't fall in Sekiro!
[1:02:30] <@commanderclaw> Video games want you to go towards the light, they are training you to die
[1:02:31] <Pairoschuz> Imagine falling off cliffs, this post made by the sekiro gang
[1:02:31] <%QueequegTheater> @weissguard It is absurdly stable
[1:02:33] <LodiFrostbeard> drop your shield
[1:02:33] <MoonObscure> lol
[1:02:34] <$JJnAJjohnson> oh, you fuckin FALL in THIS game
[1:02:35] <%MrBorisMakarov> know what I mean?
[1:02:35] <%skm742> nah, you can get some rusted coins in the next room
[1:02:38] <+CaptainJax> that was also a lie Kappa
[1:02:39] <+Order_of_Mystery> go right
[1:02:40] <LodiFrostbeard> perfect
[1:02:40] <coke_monster> Thats a good quote
[1:02:40] <MayShip> was that a lie?
[1:02:41] <fran031> Real talk: Does anyone actually think that the health bar thingy from this game is fair?
[1:02:41] <%starotter70> Perfect
[1:02:41] <BaronVonMagpie> "sometimes, i will lie"
[1:02:43] <weissguard> Sweet, thanks dude! @QueequegTheater
[1:02:43] <DarkShadow124> It begins
[1:02:43] <%skm742> I think
[1:02:43] <Coystick> Look at the Vagina LIGHT
[1:02:44] <ProRJHunter> Perfect
[1:02:45] <lloyddboy> FIGHT OGRE
[1:02:46] <Run44forrest> sometimes
[1:02:48] <+HelveticaScenario> That's a lie
[1:02:49] <$lotharrio> There are two Pats. One will always lie, the other will always tell the truth.
[1:02:49] <possumwalsh1221> Fantastic
[1:02:49] <DandyMackeroos> But really this game is out to get you from the very beginning unlike the other games where you‚Äôre more likely to stumble onto death.
[1:02:49] <EASrake> augh tthe bit rate
[1:02:50] <foreverN2dust> apatSmug
[1:02:51] <Prevot> eeehhhhh
[1:02:52] <$jobbedbone> the power stance system in this is so cool. Adds so much build variety
[1:02:52] <%QueequegTheater> @weissguard I'm on a laptop and get a buttery smooth 1080/60
[1:02:53] <ShichiNoBushi> "Sometimes" is the optimal ammount of lying.
[1:02:54] <%LupaTheWolf> except to amuse us
[1:02:56] <moore595> "I'll lie sometimes."
[1:02:56] <%theslippybrit> eat your hands
[1:02:58] <Zinitrad> So which Dark Souls has Paige beat again? I know she beat bloodborne, iwith power and finesse
[1:02:59] <+Grayhammatter> am awful jump
[1:03:00] <cureneckbeard> He won't lie but he will activate „ÄåCRAZY TALK„Äç
[1:03:01] <Jack_of_No_Trades> I actually feel warm and giddy and nostalgic watching Paige play a Dark Soul again. :) I wasn't expecting this emotion.

[1:55:14] <%QueequegTheater> My poor blood pressure
[1:55:18] <+FatherGreyBeard> I did this exact thing. I was scared of the tutorial mist and so I had to learn how to play on my own.

[1:58:03] <b_ikki> r2 only playthrough
[1:58:05] <%beyonddegeneracy> clap them dusty old cheeks Paige!
[1:58:05] <%GeneralSCPatton> Doesn't it have to be a neutral attack?
[1:58:10] <Louie_Salmon> It always helps to lock on and I don't comprehend how that isn't the first thing she wants to do
[1:58:13] <%QueequegTheater> @nzolozabal No but she has died 3 times already
[1:58:16] <leargo> Paige ded
[1:58:19] <%theslippybrit> roll into the attack to steal their satisfaction
[1:58:21] <+aivalera> Dagger on second for improved backstabs

[1:58:39] <nzolozabal> @QueequegTheater Okay. I just posted death 4 prematurely.
[1:58:39] <Niney_Who> 1
[1:58:41] <tigerfang86> CRAZY TALK
[1:58:41] <Louie_Salmon> Which sucks, because after removing the lighting the game could totally have handled ragdolls
[1:58:42] <Too_Much_Nukie> Not true.
[1:58:43] <Coystick> Betch SALIVA
[1:58:43] <+YumoNikki> Pat are you serious?
[1:58:45] <axelcezar> you can rename shit with Cheat Engine
[1:58:47] <coke_monster> Pat isnt into high level pvp
[1:58:48] <moragtang> In this game it's useful since backstep has iframes.
[1:58:49] <$SvenHolgersson> Baetch
[1:58:49] <Too_Much_Nukie> Backstep takes less stamina.
[1:58:50] <b_ikki> cmon pat doesnt do pvp
[1:58:51] <%Addem_Up> crazy talk activates once more
[1:58:51] <+Das_Bass> apatCrazy
[1:58:52] <tigerfang86> Pat that's CRAZY TALK
[1:58:52] <+Chewygamer> if it was faster or longer than your roll it would be a thing but its not
[1:58:52] <UrsaMinor222> pvp
[1:58:53] <$CommanderSqueaks> Pat, what the hell.
[1:59:01] <sosuke5> Never not strong attack
[1:59:05] <Tisaric> those damage numbers are hilarious
[1:59:10] <%ThePuddingDead> u have 3
[1:59:11] <%theslippybrit> cus hit it and quit it
[1:59:12] <Slan2350> they just blank it out if you use profanities
[1:59:13] <%Keyd00d> you have 3
[1:59:15] <+patriotrenegade> Because she thinks it‚Äôs a turn based RPG
[1:59:15] <+YumoNikki> PAT YOU BACKSTEP THROUGH PEOPLE THROWING THE SUN AT YOU
[1:59:15] <+Tyonidus> Does Paige know she can just R1? She doesn't have to R2 every time? Unless I'm an idiot and that IS the R1
[1:59:15] <flubber3d> one hit heavy hits for life
[1:59:16] <%Addem_Up> backstep has a unique attack afteryou use it
[1:59:18] <Sphincter_Spelunker> watch out for the 2nd swallow
[1:59:19] <+Jv9ufxcy> SPARKLY
[1:59:20] <$autismweaponised> PVP useful

[1:59:23] <%QueequegTheater> @PeachSaliva Pat backstep is for PvP
[1:59:24] <cherrycottontail> put her in the coffffffin paaaaaaat

[2:32:55] <leole11> hard mode? it's trash mode
[2:32:56] <+patriotrenegade> Paige is tiny and WEAK
[2:32:56] <OwlLightningMage> It also breaks all the quest in the game
[2:32:59] <EuropantLamprey> Dark Souls has two modes. Hard Mode and Harder Mode
[2:33:00] <arcaderabbit48> I adds some cool Phantom minibosses to some areas
[2:33:06] <%lewdskeletor13> BIG and STRONG

[2:33:13] <SirKezington> Finally
[2:33:14] <aeonicvector> @Louie_Salmon @PeachSaliva it also turns off enemy permadeath
[2:33:15] <$Mendin> Has paige really found every NPC but Better Paige The NPC?
[2:33:15] <TheGrimmHuntsman> Tricking people with that ring was always fun.
[2:33:18] <$Mendin> Amazing
[2:33:26] <DatAsuna> It's best for farming rare drops
[2:33:28] <Punisher329> @patriotrenegade no she‚Äôs big & stronk
[2:33:28] <DesuDesuDokiDoki> a Cresty Boi
[2:33:29] <deity_majora> @PeachSaliva It also turns off the enemy limits so they spawn infinitely
[2:33:31] <Zarkith> You do get a SICKASS Fisting Ring if you max out that covenant though
[2:33:33] <Louie_Salmon> Still hasn't even seen the herald

[2:33:38] <Sphincter_Spelunker> yes, Paige. follow them off the cliff
[2:33:39] <Slan2350> another useless covenant that is essentially a waste of time

[2:33:48] <+OkamiDude15> alright this is a no herlad run

[2:42:29] <%WingBuffet> Dark Souls 2 best souls
[2:42:30] <aeonicvector> just pump til AGL is 99
[2:42:31] <Rigenstein> just boost ADP asap
[2:42:32] <+MarshallLee67> the concept of having to waste levels to get a decent roll is fucking awful
[2:42:34] <$autismweaponised> it also increases the speed of item usage and other slieght of hand bs

[2:42:57] <+Das_Bass> ADP
[2:43:01] <%g0atmeal> Mace is good for early game
[2:43:02] <+thefruggler> Leveling up CBT increases whip damage
[2:43:03] <Nixonesque> ADP
[2:43:04] <+YumoNikki> SeemsGood
[2:43:05] <SirKezington> This game is such a fucking drag
[2:43:05] <+ratthedeadmeme> cant wait for paige to see how much of a pile this game is
[2:43:06] <+patriotrenegade> MORE STR
[2:43:07] <@Calek> 15 ADP as soon as possible
[2:43:09] <%g0atmeal> 40 then harder at 50
[2:43:12] <+Order_of_Mystery> ADP soft cap is... 16 right?
[2:43:12] <%QueequegTheater> Breakpoints, not softcap
[2:43:13] <PatchySouls> SourPls
[2:43:14] <DesuDesuDokiDoki> soft waifus
[2:43:14] <Louie_Salmon> The ADP soft cap is complicated
[2:43:15] <OwlLightningMage> Mace is really good for beginning
[2:43:15] <Zathas> 39???
[2:43:16] <b1gboss007> and people dare say this is a good game
[2:43:17] <aeonicvector> @PeachSaliva its when agl hits 99 is when you have DS1 roll
[2:43:19] <alwayspronking> I thought is was 40-ish??
[2:43:20] <%Keyd00d> dump into ADP for a bit
[2:43:21] <leole11> i just get 100 agility
[2:43:21] <%skm742> want 99 in AGI derived stat @PeachSaliva
[2:43:23] <DesuDesuDokiDoki> amazing chest ahead
[2:43:24] <%g0atmeal> Attunement also does it
[2:43:25] <moosemonkey397> 39 is the fast roll iframes from DS1
[2:43:30] <EASrake> that's for cast speed tho right?
[2:43:30] <axelcezar> THE ENTIRE GAME IS WEIRD PAT
[2:43:32] <$BioStormX> You basically want your agility to be 95-100 minimum. You can go higher
[2:43:32] <$Mendin> Yoy want 99 agi
[2:43:35] <braydenlikestea> I only up agility to 100
[2:43:35] <$RutilusMonachus> Isn't the general go-to for adaptability like 20?
[2:43:35] <smugjorgen> you get lots of level in DS2
[2:43:35] <NatetheHunter> 100 will give her a pretty good roll
[2:43:36] <+terminallyCapriciousz> Minimum Adaptability is 25 I think
[2:43:37] <Valentinius_Anodyne> Want 105 in Agility, I think actually
[2:43:40] <%skm742> 99 AGI = 12 i frames
[2:43:45] <Sphincter_Spelunker> Advise Paige to bench this for Doki Doki
[2:43:45] <BrachyZoid> We doing STR build?
[2:43:46] <+thefruggler> VIGOR??
[2:43:47] <Dragon_Batman> That sounds like a good plan
[2:43:48] <godlesscruelty> ADP to 27 whenever for tolerable rolls
[2:43:48] <Louie_Salmon> I think 17 is an earlier breakpoint for a decent roll
[2:43:48] <TheBlankAce> Quality of life stuff first
[2:43:50] <NatetheHunter> 105 should be max for this playthrough
[2:43:51] <%QueequegTheater> @PeachSaliva Pat, ADP has no actual softcap, agility has a soft cap at 110
[2:43:52] <+moink1234> fA
[2:43:53] <GalaxyGirlChel> so vigorous

[2:43:58] <%Addem_Up> agility at 99 is best
[2:43:58] <%Gogogolem> You mean six years from now?
[2:43:59] <%sleepy_coffee> Full adapt
[2:43:59] <Lastname_Firstname> invincibility frames stat tdogWL
[2:44:00] <cureneckbeard> Put luck up to fifty. Have lucky faith
[2:44:01] <$ESP_ROOT> yeah i know paige :)
[2:44:01] <leole11> remember vit
[2:44:04] <+Tyonidus> You are all saying different numbers for adaptability and I hate it
[2:44:04] <ShichiNoBushi> Big before Strong.
[2:44:05] <el_phthalo> Eh, 25-26 is more than enough to get you through the game, just enough to hit 99-100 agl.
[2:44:05] <aeonicvector> just get the AGI from ADP up to 99
[2:44:05] <arcaderabbit48> She really needs more Stamina. She's chewing through her bar like candy
[2:44:07] <+thefruggler> Rush 60 STR
[2:44:08] <+moink1234> Fair enough
[2:44:08] <%Addem_Up> 100 gives you a backstep i-frame increase
[2:44:09] <Rare_SK> power stance UGS
[2:44:09] <+megaotter> have her do the BEAR SEEK SEEK LEST before she leaves
[2:44:11] <Rigenstein> gonna end up using the big sword..
[2:44:12] <$Bt_Robot> If she's going big strong, why would she need a roll?
[2:44:12] <+psydaku> no INT for paige LUL
[2:44:12] <+patriotrenegade> @peachsaliva Pat get her some DEX so she can use the Grand Lance
[2:44:13] <%QueequegTheater> 99
[2:44:13] <Too_Much_Nukie> @PeachSaliva Paige should dual wield greatswords at the endgame.
[2:44:14] <cureneckbeard> Everything's at zero but Luck's at fifty
[2:44:14] <%MaximumDaximum> what about vitality?
[2:44:18] <blackbeaking> Give Paige the guts sword!!
[2:44:18] <leole11> greatsword is ridiculosly heavy
[2:44:19] <EuropantLamprey> 96 Agl is good for begining
[2:44:19] <Aydarkzero> doesn't adp stop at 20 or something?
[2:44:19] <+RobertThePatriot> She should fight the pursuer first thing.
[2:44:20] <SirKezington> I hate it
[2:44:20] <%skm742> 99 AGI is comfortable
[2:44:21] <%QueequegTheater> @PeachSaliva 99 Agility
[2:44:22] <Louie_Salmon> And multiple things raise agility
[2:44:25] <aeonicvector> 17 or so is DS1
[2:44:26] <mercado94> 4
[2:44:27] <ECRead> don't forget, attunement ALSO affects rolls
[2:44:27] <Zarkith> 27 is the Vigor Softcap in DS3
[2:44:27] <NatetheHunter> 100 agility at the least
[2:44:28] <Slan2350> oh no Pat is planning out her build...this can only be amazing
[2:44:31] <+Varnarok> 24
[2:44:32] <Scrub_Seeker> 25 is pretty good
[2:44:33] <subjectg> You need about 90 agility as of now, but the goal should be around 100 @peachsaliva
[2:44:33] <+CandideCamera> just play the game maybe
[2:44:35] <%QueequegTheater> @PeachSaliva Remember, Agility has breakpoints
[2:44:39] <+ArcanumMBD> remember when people thought Adaptability did nothing? Good times
[2:44:43] <%QueequegTheater> 99
[2:44:47] <Sphincter_Spelunker> hey, Pat. you smell
[2:44:48] <%QueequegTheater> 99 is the optimum BP
[2:44:52] <gloriousdemon> Rush str and endurance and get her stun locking bosses
[2:44:53] <aeonicvector> 17 agility is about what you want for MOST of this game
[2:44:54] <%skm742> 100 AGI only gives you one more frame on your backstep
[2:44:55] <%CappuccinoGuil> What's the build we're planning?
[2:44:56] <%karatepistolfist> DS2 isn't even that great so why do I remember it so fondly?!?
[2:44:58] <Louie_Salmon> 17, 25-ish, 39 are the breakpoints
[2:44:58] <%sleepy_coffee> I tried magic build for my first play through and man that didn‚Äôt work for me
[2:44:59] <+JenovasPuppet> I think you mean 28 is the Vigor softcap. Can't leave it at ugly 27.
[2:45:03] <+thefruggler> 60 STR üò°
[2:45:04] <aimlesshealer> END, then big STR
[2:45:06] <%QueequegTheater> @karatepistolfist cuz it's great
[2:45:07] <%Addem_Up> 24 adaptability should be good for agility
[2:45:07] <subjectg> Vigor softcaps at 40 in this one no?
[2:45:08] <Futurecity10> @PeachSaliva ENB, who wrote the guide for this game, said to just level Adapt to 20
[2:45:11] <+KoyaMusa> make her get a mace early on
[2:45:13] <Zombrocom> get 99 agi for now
[2:45:15] <Kazic5000> ADAPTIBILITY STRONK
[2:45:16] <el_phthalo> Thought 29 was the Vigor softcap.
[2:45:18] <EuropantLamprey> Adapt also makes your drink Estus faster
[2:45:19] <%QueequegTheater> @subjectg That's the second softcap

[3:39:07] <+thefruggler> I like that Paige is having the opposite problem Woolie had. Where he refused to drop his shield, she won't stop mashing attack.
[3:39:08] <+AtlasMcCoy> big anger
[3:39:11] <+jjhoho> cus if not you'll feel like SHIT
[3:39:12] <$RutilusMonachus> This woman beat bloodborne

[3:39:30] <$lotharrio> There's a moderately good Parma in the other direction.
[3:39:30] <$RutilusMonachus> Just think about that, this is the same person that beat Bloodborne
[3:39:31] <+patriotrenegade> She beat Ebrietas under two minutes
[3:39:32] <befreakinhappy> You can do it!
[3:39:34] <Jack_of_No_Trades> please believe in yourself Paige. It is the most important lesson you learn with every one of these games.
[3:39:35] <+KoyaMusa> is paige gonna naturally despawn all the enemies by killing them 11 times?
[3:39:42] <+patriotrenegade> Yes
[3:39:43] <sl8r4l8r> I can die happy if Paige can just get to the next bonfire.
[3:39:45] <+patriotrenegade> Absolutely.
[3:39:45] <salty_noodles_> Get a shield
[3:39:46] <foreverN2dust> This woman beat bloodstarved the first try and ebrietas on her second.

[3:39:54] <Bloodninja15> Bloodborne aint hard
[3:39:55] <$TeraMercier> Ebrietas is a QTE for strength builds

[3:49:16] <Someperson109> Exhaust dialogue
[3:49:20] <SForlord> I've rewatched the DS2 LP so much for background noise because of how nice the Majula theme is.
[3:49:24] <$lotharrio> Considering she keeps eating hits, VGR might make more sense.
[3:49:30] <DesuDesuDokiDoki> ?
[3:49:32] <bleugh> hp go up
[3:49:33] <+lordsdb> I was still thinking you could level up though the bonfire when I said why not level earlier, my bad
[3:49:36] <ShichiNoBushi> VGR gives more HP.
[3:49:49] <+KoyaMusa> 40 endurance no damage run incoming
[3:49:51] <King_Wolf_Rigger> You know, it's odd that FromSoft never realized that fans of the series liked hearing the level up lady, but only when she talked WHILE you leveled up.
[3:49:53] <$lotharrio> And that key.
[3:49:54] <DandyMackeroos> The Majula theme really is one the best things about this game.
[3:50:07] <VJdarkworld> @SForlord i made majula theme my animal crossing town jingle
[3:50:10] <%QueequegTheater> Also tons of other stuff
[3:50:11] <jerkhov_> hp goes up always so you can‚Äôt screw yourself over with bad optimization
[3:50:14] <ShichiNoBushi> Good thing you don't have to use the souls one at a time like in DS1.

[3:50:37] <NeroInfinite> 20 each

[3:51:53] <SulfurousAcid> does 3 houses have weapon durability?
[3:51:54] <$CommanderSqueaks> WAIT I stopped paying attention for a minute, we're on the pigs again!?
[3:51:54] <@Calek> isn't weapon durability in Fire Emblem just MP for your weapon skills
[3:51:59] <+Kurogane_Dread> SLOPPEH
[3:52:05] <DandyMackeroos> @lodifrostbeard It‚Äôs very soothing the majority of it before it gives off this nostalgic feeling near the end. And Majula itself is very pretty to look at.
[3:52:06] <$TeraMercier> Going back to Fallout 3 durability after New Vegas was like a max damage nightmare
[3:52:11] <+oOZtkOo> i looked away for a bit the pigs?!?
[3:52:11] <theRESNACKable> the tech
[3:52:11] <Prevot> durability sucks ass and they shouldn't have brought it back for Fire Emblem

[3:54:17] <gloriousdemon> Pigs are too human
[3:54:18] <$TeraMercier> @lotharrio I'm pretty sure there's only one merchant who buys your stuff in 2 and he moves around
[3:54:29] <+AtlasMcCoy> Fight of the century. Disabled Ogre vs 3 pork chops.
[3:54:29] <%skm742> doesn't she have a shard? She could just hit the blacksmith.
[3:54:30] <Someperson109> Emerald herald is the worst waifu
[3:54:30] <InugamiTheHound> remember the username "ruptured horse anus" from that shadow puzzel video
[3:54:31] <shmupdogjoe> Go fuck is the variant of that card game I wasn't allowed to play when I was little
[3:54:35] <DracaenaLeaf> Spoiilers tho
[3:54:35] <%QueequegTheater> THAT HAS ALREADY HAPPENED TWICE
[3:54:43] <cureneckbeard> I remember that
[3:54:46] <$lotharrio> @TeraMercier Are you sure? I thought most merchants can buy.
[3:54:46] <NeroInfinite> ahaha I remember that
[3:54:47] <suikudo> she is gonna roll into that fucking hole
[3:54:49] <LoliKappa> the chances are so high that it already happened
[3:54:51] <+Hankovitch> unless they changed something, the hub merchants don't buy items
[3:54:53] <King_Wolf_Rigger> That was a good moment

[3:56:01] <+AMSTHEGREAT> you want to get your agility up to a certain amount, it'll give your rolls more frames, also makes your estus animation a bit faster as well I think

[4:02:46] <InugamiTheHound> read more sonic fanfic
[4:02:47] <%THATGUY_789> Autophagia is the condition when you eat oneself, Autopagia is when Paige causes others to eat oneself
[4:02:47] <aimlesshealer> Wouldn't mind shorter streams, makes it easier to keep up
[4:02:52] <%MightyMaxT> Have you gone to the Eye Doctor since the last Souls game?
[4:02:55] <%ThePuddingDead> funny she's saying that on ANOTHER dark souls game
[4:02:55] <Nixonesque> she's never going to the optometrist, give it up
[4:02:56] <+Kise77> "Actually going" has been said since the start of the streams hasn't it?
[4:02:59] <%sleepy_coffee> You gotta get Elmo to mediate the streams like‚ÄùPaaaaat Emlo said it was my turn to streams.‚Äù
[4:03:00] <%WheatlyXT> Go to the medical eye professional

[4:03:34] <Mrbaconator> @PeachSaliva I would rather you feel better then have you sickly dance for my entertainment
[4:03:34] <%QueequegTheater> @PeachSaliva We literally are okay with once a month streams if it's for your health

[4:04:08] <DatAsuna> Boys re dumb at seeing makeup
[4:04:09] <PimpasaurusRex> We can't be big and strong all the time, no need to be embarrassed.
[4:04:10] <CopperTucker> You look flawless Paige
[4:04:13] <Wyrmsblood> goddamn that's a lot of makeup
[4:04:18] <%QueequegTheater> @Bane_Kaikyo Was it less than $5
[4:04:19] <DandyMackeroos> Might be the distance
[4:04:23] <%Gouf_Troop> Shes also the worst
[4:04:24] <+ArcanumMBD> Because people have shit taste
[4:04:24] <$TeraMercier> @Bane_Kaikyo I donated near the start of gameplay and they haven't gotten to me
[4:04:25] <InugamiTheHound> boys don't know what makeup is
[4:04:26] <worldbrand> that's because people keep posting #nomakeup with very neutral makeup
[4:04:27] <+ArcanumMBD> Shamir is best
[4:04:28] <mistersups> The Natural looking make up. The kind people are used to so they don't see
[4:04:28] <+Kataguro> Everyone picks waifu house because they are shallow. Blue Lions 4life
[4:04:29] <%WheatlyXT> The lighting makes your makeup look natural

[4:04:49] <Trash_leviathan> paige is a pillar man
[4:04:54] <%FruitPunchSamuraiJ> Like Pat

[4:05:31] <+Kataguro> @ArcanumMBD Someday they will know the high quality that is Dedue doing anything
[4:05:31] <hntronium> A dick with a beard
[4:05:31] <%FruitPunchSamuraiJ> she's going hollow
[4:05:32] <faegbeard> look like THE undead, not just AN undead
[4:05:34] <ShichiNoBushi> Paige has died a few times and become cursed.

[4:06:16] <+Kataguro> Yeah, this was great
[4:06:17] <%QueequegTheater> I like DS2's protag, the stuff near the end with you-know-who gives them an actual sense of agency
[4:06:21] <aimlesshealer> The best games are the ones you can hate with your whole heart and soul
[4:06:29] <hntronium> Where has Elmo been
[4:06:32] <+Schrodingers_Box> Send Paige through Resident Evil 2 Remake
[4:06:35] <kryedge> Has Peach seen Honda-San, the anime of the librarian SKELETON
[4:06:39] <%QueequegTheater> Unike DS1/3/DeS's characters

[4:07:04] <Ion_Laser> @rubberfistfight The VOD will be worth it
[4:07:06] <bear_breaker20> your mirror image is not your actual image*
[4:07:14] <Youwereeatenbyalid> God damn it when will the subreddit mods add peach to the sidebar?
[4:07:17] <El_Desperad0> eww no
[4:07:17] <+Kataguro> Featuring Drugs
[4:07:20] <$RubberFistFight> @Ion_Laser Oh I'm sure it will. Did she have a good time?
[4:07:21] <SulfurousAcid> you don't see your face as often as you see other people's faces
[4:07:24] <+IMDRanged> You have a Create-a-Character Face with sliders on full
[4:07:25] <El_Desperad0> It sucks and isn't canon
[4:07:28] <%QueequegTheater> Fugo a bitch

[4:07:50] <$Bane_Kaikyo> <3
[4:07:53] <%iwishthiswasicq> Purple Haze is more interesting than Fugo.
[4:07:55] <NeroInfinite> PHF is super not canon

[4:09:28] <$TeraMercier> Pat was ahngry
[4:09:33] <%QueequegTheater> It is my favorite game of all time
[4:09:40] <Nixonesque> adp is super dumb
[4:09:43] <b1gboss007> no one does
[4:09:54] <aimlesshealer> It takes some getting used to
[4:09:59] <$TeraMercier> float through the game like a cloud
[4:10:10] <%QueequegTheater> @PeachSaliva The word you're looking for is "floatier"
[4:10:13] <%sleepy_coffee> The terminator named Bernadetta got crazier after throwing an accuracy ring on her
[4:10:21] <subjectg> Floatier, but snappier i feel
[4:10:24] <DandyMackeroos> It‚Äôs quite strange since they just ended up fusing several of the stats in the next game.
[4:10:25] <%QueequegTheater> ^
[4:10:31] <$Bt_Robot> This player character seems to have lots of recovery time
[4:10:33] <+jessedouglas> sekiro and bb are fast
[4:10:45] <$RubberFistFight> @PeachSaliva Movement is more "flowing" in DaS2 but holy fuck you feel slow as shit in the beginning. Like your character takes "drink estus NOW PLEASE" as a general suggestion rather than a direct instruction.
[4:10:47] <%Gouf_Troop> what does floaty mean
[4:10:52] <$jaxondorfred> DoritosChip DoritosChip DoritosChip
[4:10:54] <Wyrmsblood> can't wait to see all the dark souls 1 fan fiction in this game
[4:10:56] <Tampaoster> heavier and clunkier
[4:10:58] <The_Introspector> That feel is enough for me to hate this game.
[4:10:58] <%Addem_Up> you gotta plan out what you're doing in DS2
[4:10:59] <ShichiNoBushi> Demon Souls?
[4:11:02] <carrion_king_> you said 1
[4:11:04] <SulfurousAcid> 2
[4:11:04] <Mornaka> 2
[4:11:04] <$TeraMercier> 2
[4:11:05] <%FloorBurger> NOPE
[4:11:05] <+JenovasPuppet> "What about Dark Souls?"
[4:11:05] <Prevot> NotLikeThis
[4:11:06] <carrion_king_> like 5 times
[4:11:07] <%Addem_Up> 2
[4:11:08] <Nina96> 3 times
[4:11:09] <+Piemen99> 2
[4:11:09] <Trash_leviathan> you sadi ds1
[4:11:10] <aimlesshealer> 2
[4:11:11] <$TeraMercier> She def didn't say 3
[4:11:11] <$Bt_Robot> The sun is getting low
[4:11:11] <%Binary_Fireball> 4
[4:11:13] <whitepantherz> you did not say 3 lmao
[4:11:13] <BabbittDog> Never said 3
[4:11:13] <Dragon_Batman> It sounded like you were talking bout 1
[4:11:18] <%ssjklyco> she said 1
[4:11:20] <+Intolerable> NEVER MENTIONED 3
[4:11:25] <DandyMackeroos> She didn‚Äôt mention 3
[4:11:29] <Sphincter_Spelunker> @Gouf_Troop delayed ending actions, I guess?
[4:11:33] <%QueequegTheater> @PeachSaliva All of the problems of this game's movement boil down to the shittiness of the ADP system. If you started the game at 105 Agility it would feel greaat
[4:11:33] <$nademonkey1100> 3 is much faster than 1
[4:11:33] <d00med_magus> 42 ti
[4:11:35] <%WingBuffet> 3 feels faster and lighter than 1
[4:11:42] <$TeraMercier> 3 feels nimble
[4:11:45] <DandyMackeroos> You regain the armor chunk in 3
[4:11:49] <Sozu_> 3 is bloodborne
[4:11:51] <$RubberFistFight> Fume Knight is one of the best goddamn fights in the whole game though
[4:11:58] <%Addem_Up> Good ol' Raime
[4:12:04] <carrion_king_> Wasn't his soul broken by the end?
[4:12:04] <PimpasaurusRex> Fume knight was fun, smelter demon was the one that got me tilting
[4:12:05] <mistersups> FUME KNIGHT is great, but a fuck
[4:12:05] <The_Introspector> DS3 is like an inbetween of DS1 and BB.
[4:12:05] <%QueequegTheater> Raime is AMAZING
[4:12:08] <DatAsuna> one shot
[4:12:11] <$RubberFistFight> I love how wearing Velstadt's helm makes him hulk out
[4:12:12] <+IMDRanged> woolieF sbfpSetIn woolieU
[4:12:17] <befreakinhappy> Fume Knight is fucking hard
[4:12:18] <NeroInfinite> Fume knight a fuck man
[4:12:19] <Tampaoster> pat get the mic closer to your mouth please

[4:12:23] <Laironx3> enbBlock
[4:12:25] <%QueequegTheater> @PeachSaliva All of the problems of this game's movement boil down to the shittiness of the ADP system. If you started the game at 105 Agility it would feel greaat
[4:12:25] <%Addem_Up> suffering
[4:12:29] <OwlLightningMage> Alonne is more fun
[4:12:31] <subjectg> You spend so little time at < 90 agility though
[4:12:31] <aimlesshealer> So Peach will kill him in 30 seconds?
[4:12:31] <DandyMackeroos> He‚Äôs a big fuck
[4:12:32] <worldbrand> i liked alonne as a fight but had more trouble with fume
[4:12:34] <$RubberFistFight> @Addem_Up yeah now that's just crazy
[4:12:35] <$Mendin> Ebrietas got clowned, Orphan of Kos 2.0
[4:12:37] <$TeraMercier> Yeah, Pat, the mic is farish
[4:12:39] <DandyMackeroos> And at the end you come out satisfied
[4:12:48] <$RubberFistFight> @worldbrand Sir Alonne's arena is gorgeous.

[4:13:49] <Ion_Laser> ^
[4:13:50] <Baconrath> almighty no solicitors sign
[4:13:51] <StaticSunrise> that's fucked up
[4:13:52] <$TeraMercier> It's rude to invade someone's space
[4:13:54] <%Addem_Up> electrify the fence
[4:13:56] <Trash_leviathan> if a disabled women can wreck ebrietas then anyone can
[4:13:56] <DestroyerDJ8> paige would break the door instead
[4:13:57] <crazy_laughter> Peach, you walk into doors
[4:14:01] <Sphincter_Spelunker> BUT YOU DIDN'T THIS TIME
[4:14:01] <Neo_Kaiser> Peach would walk right into a door.
[4:14:01] <%ssjklyco> She already got the Slab, so I expect her to get a boss to glitch out
[4:14:02] <korean_random> just close it 4Head
[4:14:02] <+Schrodingers_Box> Put up a NRA Sticker
[4:14:03] <aimlesshealer> He's gonna put that McDonald's in your mouth

[4:14:07] <crazy_laughter> You destroy doors, woman
[4:14:07] <ShichiNoBushi> Break doors, too.
[4:14:12] <$nademonkey1100> why the fuck do people do that?
[4:14:16] <Baconrath> @PeachSaliva are door checkers a thing in canada
[4:14:16] <BabbittDog> @PeachSaliva I missed something, did someone just walk in your house?
[4:14:18] <%Addem_Up> Paige is proven to open doors and then walk the other way

[4:21:20] <befreakinhappy> We're not mad, we're disappointed.
[4:21:20] <+JenovasPuppet> Paige isn't pulling that from nowhere. I think that used to be the case like decades ago
[4:21:21] <foreverN2dust> Did chat tell you that? big 3
[4:21:23] <jeosadn> Paige is SUPER right
[4:21:23] <+Schrodingers_Box> GO TO THE DOCTOR!
[4:21:24] <+Toast_Master_General> Because if you get it done while they're still getting worse after the surgery they'll start reverting
[4:21:24] <Zedimonx5> BIG WRONG! 2! 2!
[4:21:24] <King_Wolf_Rigger> Why would you listen to anyone but the doctor?
[4:21:24] <ShichiNoBushi> Get some Bato cyber eyes.
[4:21:25] <+HelveticaScenario> Don't get laser surgery
[4:21:26] <%depressed_skeleton> "Doctor why am i BLIND"
[4:21:28] <jeosadn> DONT BELIVE HIS LIES
[4:21:32] <Mornaka> Don't listen to us, we're crazy
[4:21:32] <calebhardman21> if it's not a doctor do not listen to no one
[4:21:34] <jwhoff619> Please take care of yourself
[4:21:35] <+AXL808> "You shouldn't take any medicine until you're dead"
[4:21:35] <$realm_forge> GO TO THE FUCKING EYE DOCTER
[4:21:38] <hntronium> @foreverN2dust 4
[4:21:39] <DandyMackeroos> You must receive the laser beams in your eyes
[4:21:43] <%ThePuddingDead> i thiiiink i fucked up my sub message
[4:21:44] <%ssjklyco> You know when you go to the doctor? it's after you stop getting worst and are dead
[4:21:45] <%bbHighvalor> bnest dark souls game
[4:21:46] <$Bt_Robot> The trick is to look directly into the sun. This is the true lasik.
[4:21:46] <%QueequegTheater> IT'S NOT AS BAD 3 MOTHERFUCKERS
[4:21:46] <Jolly_Adventurer> It's fine
[4:21:46] <+TravisSchnee> Next stream get them good eyes and surprise errybody
[4:21:51] <%THATGUY_789> waaaaaaiiiit, waaaaaaiiiit, waaaaaiiiiiiit. now is blind
[4:21:52] <DatAsuna> It's my second favourite
[4:21:52] <%Addem_Up> ds2 is the best
[4:21:54] <OwlLightningMage> It's the worst one.
[4:21:55] <%QueequegTheater> @PeachSaliva All of the problems of this game's movement boil down to the shittiness of the ADP system. If you started the game at 105 Agility it would feel greaat
[4:21:57] <b1gboss007> ADP
[4:21:58] <Prevot> it's the weakest by far
[4:21:59] <smilemychild> ds2 is great
[4:22:00] <Dragon_Batman> It's still a good game but in terms of it's others it is kinda bad
[4:22:00] <befreakinhappy> It's by far the worst one
[4:22:04] <CosmiStar> nice Mao Mao shirt Pat lol
[4:22:05] <Wyrmsblood> DS2 is the worst one
[4:22:05] <%Addem_Up> ds2>ds1>BB>ds3
[4:22:07] <b1gboss007> FLOATY
[4:22:07] <%sleepy_coffee> They just hand you a walking cane
[4:22:10] <DatAsuna> 3 is the worst
[4:22:10] <The_Introspector> I miss Bloodborne too. Just replay that game instead of DS2.
[4:22:12] <+Anonymasque> I've also gotten that advice though.. like you shouldn't get lasik if something like astigmatism is still changing your eyesight.
[4:22:13] <subjectg> DS2 is better than 3 if you ask me
[4:22:17] <FriendlyCheer> My favorite one actually
[4:22:22] <OwlLightningMage> I've put the most hours into it by far and its easily the worst one
[4:22:29] <b1gboss007> 3 doesnt have adp or soulmemory tho
[4:22:29] <%QueequegTheater> But Lucatiel and Vengarl and Vendrick and Aldia are SO FUCKING COOL
[4:22:31] <+AntithesisEK> aggressive gorilla blood frenzy
[4:22:31] <Dragon_Batman> Bloodborne did help the aggressive style
[4:22:33] <cherubs_anonymous> Brute smarts
[4:22:33] <Trash_leviathan> bb is the best on e
[4:22:34] <Prevot> bloodborne is a way easier and more forgiving game
[4:22:36] <King_Wolf_Rigger> Hyper aggressive and fast
[4:22:36] <befreakinhappy> it's easily the easiest one
[4:22:37] <%QueequegTheater> Yes
[4:22:37] <DracaenaLeaf> yes
[4:22:37] <benjiFG> it did
[4:22:38] <$RubberFistFight> @PeachSaliva Paige you broke your hands playing it!! LUL
[4:22:39] <Trash_leviathan> yes
[4:22:39] <%FloorBurger> yes
[4:22:40] <ShichiNoBushi> Where doess Sekiro stand?
[4:22:40] <Mornaka> it did
[4:22:41] <befreakinhappy> 3 came after Bloodborne
[4:22:42] <%THATGUY_789> Paige's life is a Nightmare
[4:22:43] <%zeki177> Bloodborn is the best one for sure
[4:22:44] <b1gboss007> yes
[4:22:44] <TheArrow_> I just wish DS2 didn't have such awful bosses
[4:22:45] <%ssjklyco> Fast and loose in a pigs asshole
[4:22:49] <Sphincter_Spelunker> Straightforward
[4:22:53] <+AXL808> Paige is saying she lives her life in madness
[4:22:55] <%s_xylocalsingles> bloodborne hardest
[4:22:55] <subjectg> Like I said, you spend so little time at <90 agility that starting at 105 would be superfluous
[4:22:56] <+JenovasPuppet> It's harder for Pat
[4:22:56] <befreakinhappy> Dark Souls 1 is the hardest
[4:22:57] <%ThePuddingDead> @PeachSaliva Please Please PLEASE check out Happy Souls, it's the best part of Dark Souls 2
[4:22:57] <%g0atmeal> Sekiro harder than BB harder than DS3
[4:22:58] <Caidezes> The Orphan of Kos is no joke.
[4:22:59] <+ChunLoArt> BB is easily the easiest
[4:23:00] <worldbrand> Nah I found DS2 harder than bloodborne
[4:23:03] <King_Wolf_Rigger> DS 3 mixes them, but god I hate it.
[4:23:03] <TheBlankAce> It depends on the person
[4:23:04] <$nademonkey1100> ds3 is garbo i hate it i just want ds2 or 1 kinda game they made it to bloodbourney
[4:23:04] <%s_xylocalsingles> @PeachSaliva no Paige, bloodborne is hardest
[4:23:05] <OwlLightningMage> Bloodborne is the easiest by far
[4:23:08] <Prevot> I starter with BB and it's the easiest
[4:23:10] <%ThePuddingDead> I should watch that tonight
[4:23:10] <+TheShal> Bloodborne lets you HEAL BY HITTING.
[4:23:11] <Wyrmsblood> Bloodborne is the hardest
[4:23:12] <Neo_Kaiser> I had no problem in Bloodborne
[4:23:12] <%ThePuddingDead> so wholesome
[4:23:15] <The_Introspector> Demon's Souls is the easiest. Bloodborne is hardest.
[4:23:15] <blackbeaking> Depending on your style of play bloodborne can be easier
[4:23:17] <$RubberFistFight> Orphan is easy peasy chicken dinner, what are you on about
[4:23:17] <+JenovasPuppet> Orphan is easy. Gascoign in the real final boss.
[4:23:18] <kerotuyu> But Sekiro, though
[4:23:18] <+ChunLoArt> Sekiro is the hardest
[4:23:18] <%zeki177> Ludwig is a biatch
[4:23:18] <+xShenzi> My best friend sucks at Dark Souls but beats Bloodborne no problem at all
[4:23:19] <DandyMackeroos> It depends on perspective
[4:23:20] <+Hilleltaco> Ludwig's fucked
[4:23:20] <+skylerpilot> DS2 is the hardest
[4:23:21] <%QueequegTheater> Chronologically it's DeS->DS1->DS2->BB->DS2:Scholar->DS3->Sekiro
[4:23:21] <Eggo1634> @peachsaliva don‚Äôt neglect your eyes Paige, I‚Äôm in my 30s and blind in my right eye because of putting off seeing a doctor.
[4:23:23] <%linSP> Bloodborne bosses are harder, DS2 AREAS are harder
[4:23:24] <$RubberFistFight> Ludwig and Laurence on the other hand
[4:23:25] <$Mendin> Your WRISTS WERE DYING for Ludwig, that skews it
[4:23:25] <blackbeaking> I did orphan in one shot
[4:23:27] <%Addem_Up> DS2 is easy if you can plan out what you're doing
[4:23:30] <Reanimator83> BB is not the hardest
[4:23:32] <OwlLightningMage> Bloodborne is the easiest
[4:23:34] <Prevot> movement, dodging and healing is crazy fast in BB
[4:23:34] <Sphincter_Spelunker> Bloodborne just has bosses that flail. You can just put your head down and R1
[4:23:36] <Wan6Saber> I disagree
[4:23:36] <Coystick> That's wrong MIDIR Pat
[4:23:38] <Dragon_Batman> That would depend on if it's the systems
[4:23:40] <+Hapsam> omg is this the end of the stream? this is the first time im catching the stream because of living in europe, i love your stream PeachSaliva
[4:23:40] <%THATGUY_789> what Ludwig from Mario?
[4:23:41] <TheArrow_> Demon's is the most unbalanced
[4:23:42] <Neo_Kaiser> DS2 is the easiest cause you can grind everyone away
[4:23:43] <gloriousdemon> Otogi is the easiest
[4:23:44] <+Hilleltaco> Ludwig's also weird in that he gets easier in phase 2
[4:23:50] <$Bt_Robot> Isn't darklurker the hardest?
[4:23:55] <romanticzomedy> orphan ain't so bad after elfriede
[4:23:58] <OwlLightningMage> Midir is harder than anything in BB
[4:23:59] <Zedimonx5> And Sekiro isn‚Äôt even on the list Jebaited
[4:24:06] <%zeki177> eLFRIEDE beat my ass so hard
[4:24:07] <foreverN2dust> yuri?
[4:24:08] <%QueequegTheater> @PeachSaliva DS2 is also the ONLY one with meaningful NG+ changes
[4:24:12] <hntronium> euros
[4:24:18] <CurrySauseBandit> It's an eye of the beholder thing. If your style supports blodborne's system, it's a cake walk.
[4:24:18] <Sphincter_Spelunker> white
[4:24:20] <The_Introspector> Midir isn't hard, he's just got too much damn health.
[4:24:21] <romanticzomedy> midir fucked me up
[4:24:24] <Coystick> for the gays
[4:24:26] <Moisthoodie> jerma is god
[4:24:26] <Wyrmsblood> @PeachSaliva SHUT UP NERDS
[4:24:27] <Nina96> NotLikeThis NotLikeThis NotLikeThis NotLikeThis NotLikeThis NotLikeThis NotLikeThis TehePelo TehePelo TehePelo
[4:24:27] <worldbrand> Yeah actually, after beating DS3's DLC and coming back for The Old Hunters, Maria was a joke and Kos didn't give me too much trouble
[4:24:28] <+Hilleltaco> ALL OF DA RULES
[4:24:29] <luckykae> omg
[4:24:30] <NeroInfinite> Ratss
[4:24:30] <lloyddboy> yaaaaaaay
[4:24:33] <+MisterTylerrr> We're Rats! We're Rats! We're furry and Forlorne!
[4:24:35] <+TravisSchnee> also DS2 has the best PVP by a longshot. Also Bloodbornes DLC while rad is balanced like some ass, its the hardest in that fights like Laurence just barely work.
[4:24:36] <Ion_Laser> SeemsGood
[4:24:36] <%Addem_Up> RATS
[4:24:37] <blackbeaking> If you play aggressively bloodborne is easy but dark souls fucks you
[4:24:43] <PudgePanda> Rat Gods PogChamp
[4:24:49] <%Addem_Up> rat covenant
[4:24:49] <Sphincter_Spelunker> fake fan
[4:24:51] <$RubberFistFight> @romanticzomedy Midir is an absolute nightmare at first, but once you learn him it's (relatively) easy street
[4:24:55] <+KaldorDraig0> That was wholesome as fuck
[4:24:58] <OwlLightningMage> BB is the easiest with very few exceptions
[4:25:01] <DandyMackeroos> Oh boy the Royal Rats
[4:25:01] <%QueequegTheater> DS3 feels harder than it actually is because it's full of Bloodborne bosses but still plays like DS
[4:25:05] <Trash_leviathan> WHAT
[4:25:09] <%ThePuddingDead> not a true fan
[4:25:10] <Sphincter_Spelunker> guess you aren't a real fan, then
[4:25:15] <El_Desperad0> Paige...
[4:25:18] <%ThePuddingDead> u fuckin FAKER
[4:25:28] <%Addem_Up> @QueequegTheater that's a great way to put it

[4:26:19] <Sphincter_Spelunker> being blind and wrong
[4:26:22] <+RevN7> Doesn‚Äôt matter what‚Äôs harder or easier Bloodborne is the most fun to play imo

[4:29:41] <$RubberFistFight> @PeachSaliva someone I know got their account permanently torpedoed because they used a reaction gif involving a gun, and the person they were responding to reported them for "death threats". It's completely absurd, Twitter refused to reverse their decision even though no threat was made,.
