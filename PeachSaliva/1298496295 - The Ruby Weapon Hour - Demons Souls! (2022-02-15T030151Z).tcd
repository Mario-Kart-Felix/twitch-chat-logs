[0:29:11] <GravyLangley> except all the chocolate products he does like
[0:29:14] <tanarath> "I asked"
[0:29:15] <%cherryburnout> just buy two chocolates pat

[0:30:10] <CappuccinoGuil> Paige is gonna be thriving. Moisturized. In her lane. Unbothered.
[0:30:12] <%Agami23> paige needs a soundboard and a GOXLR
[0:30:13] <+Fooguwu> You would need a physical pad for it tho or else it would take you 5 minutes and the game would crash
[0:30:15] <%KetsuoTaberu> fart with reverb
[0:30:15] <Mrbaconator> a soundboard is ALWAYS A GOOD IDEA
[0:30:18] <+derpmandwn999> Get a nut button

[0:30:36] <MrNoobMcSalt> yes but only if pat can randomly remap the sounds
[0:30:36] <jetpack_rorschasch> Does it matter what we think Paige? Because it sounds like it's already decided. Kappa
[0:30:37] <Harthhammer> Quark and Odo quotes
[0:30:38] <%maskofmichael> Cheer500 I know you probably don't care, but I have been playing the hell out of that free-to-play Yugioh Master Duel game the past couple of days and having a blast. Of course it gets frustrating sometimes when the other guy takes 10 minutes to play their turn, no joking. Also I kicked the ass out of a guy with a racial slur user name, so I'm proud of that.
[0:30:40] <Vermillion129> definitely pat soundbites

[0:37:58] <%Bluwizard21> @PeachSaliva Ok here's a problem I encountered with that. My name is Kyle, I received a lot of South Park Jokes through my life, I made my handle "A Jew" throughout Halo and when I got to TF2 I received a lot of flak saying I was racist (cause I'm not jewish) I don't hate jews, I just thought it was funny and fitting for me. What you think?
[0:37:59] <KingKZ> Paige, you are a walking miracle.
[0:38:00] <udurbalanced> No broken glass and hardly any body damage. God bless Toyota.

[0:38:40] <%barrakuta371> I thought so, but thought it was just the way he angled his head
[0:38:48] <%Sotetsu> @maskofmichael Only if you love it.

[0:40:50] <+Brassnarwhal> i heard dimaggio is stuck in negotiations about money on the podcast but havent heard aanything since
[0:41:00] <+Tucker0603> why is the mustard in the brb screen green?
[0:41:06] <%JoshManVGH> I can't beleive Hulu is trying to make their own Bender, with blackjack and hookers!
[0:41:18] <+Brassnarwhal> @gravylangley mor like recasting bart, fry is homer for sure
[0:41:28] <Pookiedaexzile> How dare they short change the Voice of Marcus Pheniox
[0:41:30] <GravyLangley> bender is more popular
[0:41:45] <%JoshManVGH> Any of them really. It's the whole team that makes that show shine.
[0:41:53] <+Brassnarwhal> @gravylangley yeah but he isn't the main character
[0:42:14] <%oAznoUta> lilyhoLilyPls
[0:42:30] <GravyLangley> @Brassnarwhal i mean you're right that fry is equivalanet ot homer in that regard, but in popularity/one of the main reasons people tune in bender is the homer
[0:42:35] <RushUnplugged> bootlicking for hulu is a new low

[0:44:13] <+penjaza> Horizon will do fine
[0:44:13] <Jerp> release timings are brutal
[0:44:16] <$NitronStreams> shoulda called it horizon: over shadowed
[0:44:18] <deviljhojho_> i gave it an honest go until i realized i dont like archery
[0:44:21] <%RayReborne> @keiganofastora Fuck Killzone lol. to each their own but fuck killzone
[0:44:23] <Coystick> I don't think there's much of a crossover between Elden Ring and Horizon's audiences
[0:44:26] <%JoshManVGH> There's also 2 weeks after Triangle Strategy to catch up
[0:44:28] <%cade_calrayn> it's a badass redhead killing dinosaurs. it's rad
[0:44:30] <%KeiganOfAstora> live, as in diehardman
[0:44:32] <+Deekman> god damn this game looks so fucking good
[0:44:34] <+Brassnarwhal> @nitronstreams Horizon: Eclipse
[0:44:35] <+cheerfulnpc> I wanted to like Horizon, but I couldn't get into it
[0:44:36] <+tempestzephyr> gave paige the weed of love
[0:44:38] <CzeekyTV> badass redhead fights giant dinosaur robots, how would it not be up Paige's alley
[0:44:38] <%legendfather_of_giants> thank god
[0:44:42] <drawie_holly> horizon is OKAY. the story is kinda bad
[0:44:45] <%cade_calrayn> though it may be hard on your hands, Paige, I broke a controller trigger fighting the T-Rex dino
[0:44:47] <+derpmandwn999> GoodBadMan

[0:48:20] <livehardman> I've never thought of a ding dong being stinky
[0:48:23] <Dianaillumani> Zangief's angry he's not in the BRB screen

[0:48:42] <%superc37> pat you are lowballing it super hard
[0:48:45] <+kyh9> Each quarter of the map is going to be its own swamp

[0:49:10] <+Brassnarwhal> @superc37 on the podcast he said a swamp per zone which i think is dead on
[0:49:12] <+notsoy> GET UR SOULS
[0:49:23] <scaryboisupreme> Do ya'll ever eat a food that you haven't eaten in a long time and then you eat it and you're like "why the fuck don't i eat this more often"

[0:49:35] <%spitelite> you should heal to full
[0:49:40] <+Brassnarwhal> psaBork
[0:49:42] <%SophiaAmoreaVeritas> Demon's Souls just wants everyone to touch some grass.
[0:49:49] <GravyLangley> ALL OF ELDEN RIGN IS JUST A SWAMP
[0:49:51] <GravyLangley> THE DEMO LIED
[0:49:53] <deviljhojho_> i've heard the deluxe version of elden ring comes with a small vial of non lethal poison for maximum immersion
[0:49:55] <livehardman> let zangief bark into mic
[0:49:58] <+kyh9> You’ll have to climb it snd it’ll give you every debuff in the game
[0:50:31] <%AncelDeLambert> Paige, you beat Bloodborne, the hardest one, you can do it
[0:50:39] <+Brassnarwhal> that's hilarious
[0:50:40] <+Caped_Eggy> DGod is difficult?
[0:50:41] <+UltraViolet371> all of them are armor spider except the ones that aren't this one
[0:50:52] <+TopTieramisu> has paige played sekiro?
[0:50:56] <+Brassnarwhal> @caped_eggy in that it is awful to play
[0:50:57] <+PrimalDweeb> One is only difficult because it's a bullshit puzzle...
[0:51:01] <%SophiaAmoreaVeritas> @Caped_Eggy "difficult"
[0:51:02] <%AncelDeLambert> Sekiro isn't souls, it's Sekiro
[0:51:07] <%AncelDeLambert> and Sekiro is bullshit
[0:51:09] <RetroCop87> You mean like Kirby?
[0:51:10] <udurbalanced> He's trying to find the meats
[0:51:11] <+Arek_1> LUL

[0:51:20] <+TopTieramisu> bullshit how LUL
[0:51:21] <%RayReborne> Sekiro is BIG PARRY FUCK YOU
[0:51:22] <scaryboisupreme> Sekiro is bullshit if you're bad at parrying
[0:51:26] <%RayReborne> its decent
[0:51:26] <drawie_holly> sekiro is a rhythm game
[0:51:26] <DanThePumpkinman> so that capcom countdown huh? We thinking sf6 or re4 remake?
[0:51:29] <%Ninestempest> Ninestempest subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 34 months, currently on a 31 month streak! 
[0:51:31] <+TopTieramisu> it's not even parrying
[0:51:31] <+Caped_Eggy> I don't remember having a problem with him
[0:51:32] <%AncelDeLambert> so it's bullshit
[0:51:34] <eyeobject> the butt is where toys go
[0:51:36] <+TopTieramisu> it's spamming block
[0:51:39] <+Arek_1> He's checking for worms.
[0:51:39] <randomlyalwaystired> @kyh9 and once you reach the top, you meet your long absent father who tells you about the world beyond the world
[0:51:41] <hairtoday> "VALENTIMES DAY MUTHURRRR"
[0:51:42] <GravyLangley> hubs says "this boss is so easy as a royal. EVERYTHING is easy as a royal"
[0:51:43] <tanarath> Paige, your wand
[0:51:47] <huskarl_zap> @danthepumpkinman Techromancer
[0:51:58] <scaryboisupreme> @DanThePumpkinman it's the REmake text font so RE4 remake for sure
[0:52:11] <%JoshManVGH> I like this reverse dignity chicken
[0:52:12] <+PrimalDweeb> Yikes...
[0:52:12] <%Ranryu692> that sounds normal for you, though
[0:52:12] <$SkookumHime> Happy Bday Peach!!!
[0:52:12] <@SoFarFetched> that sounds like normal paige talk to me
[0:52:13] <RetroCop87> but what about them?
[0:52:13] <+NWR_James> Paige, you love you them
[0:52:13] <DanThePumpkinman> @huskarl_zap are you reading my dreams?
[0:52:13] <%MrBorisMakarov> it's fine.
[0:52:15] <%SophiaAmoreaVeritas> I understood what you meant.
[0:52:16] <%oAznoUta> did you ever have a dreams?
[0:52:17] <ammobasket> I like Paige's one
[0:52:17] <tanarath> creepy49Porpkek
[0:52:19] <Rumbutt> oroLUL oroLUL oroLUL
[0:52:19] <%RayReborne> that you if you you want you that you you if you that you
[0:52:19] <%JoshManVGH> It's wholesome
[0:52:21] <%OctaivianRex> Sounded like regular Paige speech.
[0:52:24] <%That1blindkid> That1blindkid subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 9 months! Booger Goblins
[0:52:27] <+Brassnarwhal> in my experience most people who are convinced souls games are bullshit get posted on scrubquotes a lot
[0:52:27] <%JoshManVGH> CHRONO CROSS IS AWESOME!
[0:52:27] <%AncelDeLambert> Chrono Cross is good and awful
[0:52:28] <+ALazo> I you love you you guys you
[0:52:29] <RushUnplugged> "great" "game"
[0:52:31] <maxpasta> Its the count that thoughts
[0:52:34] <RetroCop87> man, I can't wait for the FF9 remaster
[0:52:35] <+ReallyBigRocks> wait was that really what it said? I feel like I read it and it was totally normal lmao
[0:52:36] <%JoshManVGH> That music is so good!
[0:52:38] <+BigCoffee> Pat has good taste, CC sucks
[0:52:42] <+tempestzephyr> Pat is Very WRONG
[0:52:45] <%Sotetsu> Chrono Cross is good, but it has waaaaay too many characters
[0:52:46] <GravyLangley> Chrono Cross is probably my husband's favorite game period
[0:52:50] <Pookiedaexzile> Trigger beat Cross
[0:52:53] <$NitronStreams> Chrono cross is a great bad game
[0:52:53] <RushUnplugged> CC is a travesty, sorry Paige
[0:52:56] <Pookiedaexzile> Like real life
[0:52:56] <tanarath> I just autotranslated it without even seeing something wrong.
[0:52:58] <%AncelDeLambert> Chrono Cross is fucking cursed. Every time I've tried to emulate it, my pc has died in some manner. Every. Time.
[0:52:59] <%SaiyanShoto> Chrono Cross is… A game
[0:52:59] <HeroToxiko> trigger will never be remastered
[0:53:05] <%oAznoUta> Square PSX games had awesome soundtracks and Chrono Cross is very much one of them
[0:53:06] <DanThePumpkinman> @scaryboisupreme yeah but it also takes place during what would have been capcom finals so who knows?
[0:53:12] <thatdudenamedlogan> Trigger doesn't need to be remastered.
[0:53:19] <+TopTieramisu> "judo moves"
[0:53:22] <%KeiganOfAstora> Getting up close is best
[0:53:23] <@SoFarFetched> @AncelDeLambert I guess it's "crossed" you for the last time Kappa
[0:53:25] <+Troispoint> Peach loves getting mansplained by Pat
[0:53:30] <%OctaivianRex> There's a much better version of this boss in Monster Hunter Rise.
[0:53:32] <DanThePumpkinman> capcom cup* finals
[0:53:34] <%KeiganOfAstora> There are safe spots up close
[0:53:36] <+derpmandwn999> Don’t touch the gamer goo
[0:53:36] <+notsoy> karate chops
[0:53:39] <Pookiedaexzile> Way of the Spider

[0:57:37] <%oAznoUta> is Lady Maria too obvious
[0:57:39] <%Ranryu692> @Pookiedaexzile it ended an hour ago
[0:57:39] <%Lion_kun> Isshin
[0:57:43] <huskarl_zap> also Ostrava would of been behind that gate if he survives
[0:57:43] <lexitheshark> Oh boy, big and strong time
[0:57:44] <Dianaillumani> I like Sister Fried
[0:57:45] <+Bailey__Gaming> @peachsaliva the hours approaching & you've got to reach your prime, that's when you need to put yourself to the test and show us a passage of time
[0:57:48] <+UltraViolet371> wow over the shoulder?
[0:57:49] <Valdorick> Mirror Knight is pretty poggers
[0:57:51] <Shacklebox> low profiled

[0:58:10] <Pookiedaexzile> Moon Presence
[0:58:13] <Admiral_PopnFresh> Pontiff Sulyvahn
[0:58:13] <%CptCreampuff16> Gwyndolin is the only correct answer due to being waifu
[0:58:15] <%Lion_kun> Nameless, O and S, Isshin
[0:58:18] <TurtlesAndTentacles> The new fan name will be Soul Borne Ring
[0:58:21] <livehardman> Pat is being nerdo
[0:58:24] <huskarl_zap> Godwyn solider number 1
[0:58:27] <+TopTieramisu> gwyndolin fight is mid though
[0:58:29] <StrapStreams> gotta love those real fake chests
[0:58:32] <%SophiaAmoreaVeritas> Fraudulent chests
[0:58:33] <dds333a> Iron Golem is also rad
[0:58:34] <randomlyalwaystired> Gwyn, because the entire fight and mood is brilliantly put together
[0:58:36] <%KeiganOfAstora> Old King Doran
[0:58:40] <%superc37> WAT
[0:58:40] <+UltraViolet371> here? some dark moon grass I think
[0:58:48] <@SoFarFetched> You know the Dead By Daylight Streamer: Otzdarva Kappa
[0:58:48] <+Arek_1> :(
[0:58:51] <%KeiganOfAstora> But even if he dies he just drops what he woulda given you later?
[0:58:52] <drawie_holly> i love the gargoyles
[0:58:52] <%superc37> HOW TF DID OSTRAVA DIED
[0:58:54] <+TopTieramisu> LUL
[0:58:56] <+notsoy> LOL
[0:58:56] <+TopTieramisu> Jebasted
[0:58:57] <Dianaillumani> He wants to be in the BRB screen
[0:59:00] <+UltraViolet371> oh yeah the sword and shield
[0:59:01] <+ClericOfSparda> I thought Pat was saying Otz got cancelled or something
[0:59:03] <+PrimalDweeb> The Tower Knight is alright
[0:59:03] <drawie_holly> super memorable
[0:59:05] <%vivaciouseff> shield and sword can be got elsewhere
[0:59:05] <Valentinius_Anodyne> Paige is also weak to fire it seems
[0:59:05] <%superc37> HOW DID PAIGE SCREW UP THAT BAD
[0:59:07] <StrapStreams> Hi Zangief
[0:59:09] <tanarath> Paige let Austrava die due to shinanigans
[0:59:09] <dds333a> LUL LUL LUL
[0:59:18] <+Bailey__Gaming> Ludwig the Holy blade is ny fave
[0:59:23] <$shurtal> Mausoleum key right?
[0:59:25] <+Arek_1> Pure Clearstone from Ostrava in 1-3.
[0:59:33] <%KeiganOfAstora> @Arek_1 Oh well
[0:59:39] <%KeiganOfAstora> Can always get it from a trade discord
[0:59:42] <+TopTieramisu> O&S? really
[0:59:47] <%Lion_kun> Ludwig is my favourite Bloodborne boss
[0:59:51] <+Kyma1020> I can see it
[0:59:53] <%KeiganOfAstora> Miyazaki just said his is 3-3 Old Monk
[0:59:55] <Midnight188> oh phew i didnt miss all of stream
[0:59:57] <Coystick> O&S or Manus for Dark 1, flip a coin
[0:59:59] <%superc37> Why didnt she just quit the game and reliad so that ostrava despawns?
[1:00:03] <+TopTieramisu> manus is my favorite from ds1
[1:00:06] <+Kyma1020> Gael just the culmination of all things souls for me.
[1:00:06] <$SkookumHime> Good night Peach! good luck!
[1:00:08] <%KeiganOfAstora> Manus? Not Artorius?
[1:00:13] <BigFingerRo> WOO
[1:00:16] <scaryboisupreme> O&S are the last fun bosses in Dark Souls until Gwyn imo
[1:00:16] <%Dakuu75> fucking storm outside is wrecking y internet
[1:00:23] <thatdudenamedlogan> What is the lore behind the muckmen holding shields
[1:00:25] <StrapStreams> In the same vein of my last question, what's your least favorite boss?
[1:00:26] <%SophiaAmoreaVeritas> Lady Maria because I enjoyed her beating me when I screwed up and was glad to have to get good. No other boss has done that for me yet.
[1:00:27] <%KeiganOfAstora> I get that Manus is so different from anything you've seen so far when playing DS1
[1:00:29] <BigFingerRo> Time for more wall-on-head action
[1:00:37] <Dianaillumani> I hope there are more Lady bosses in elden ring
[1:00:42] <RetroCop87> Jesus, I need to go to bed. I thought Pat said "when Epstein jumps down"
[1:00:42] <NireFuster> Will Paige be doing Elden Ring or will she be tagging along on Pat's stream?
[1:00:48] <+Bouerd> Champion Gundyr combos you and it fuckin rad
[1:00:52] <dds333a> @strapstreams Royal Rat Vanguard
[1:00:53] <+the22cstomp> i think the coolest boss is abyss watchers
[1:00:56] <@SoFarFetched> "Oh, to be hugged by Lady Maria. sipsipGasm "
[1:01:07] <+ReallyBigRocks> big mountain
[1:01:09] <huskarl_zap> Godrick solider is hype
[1:01:10] <%Lion_kun> So in Des, I would say Allant
[1:01:10] <+ReallyBigRocks> thats my dad
[1:01:18] <%Lion_kun> DS1 O and S
[1:01:19] <%SophiaAmoreaVeritas> @SoFarFetched LUL
[1:01:25] <%Lion_kun> DS2 Fume Knight
[1:01:27] <scaryboisupreme> I'm a psychopath cause I think Dark Souls 3 has the weakest boss fights of the series
[1:01:27] <+UltraViolet371> I'd say Dancer is up there in atmosphere and spectacle
[1:01:28] <%rumtumtugnutz> Is it appropriate to call a Boss I'd Like to Fight a BILF?
[1:01:32] <drawie_holly> kay but which souls boss would you DATE on aValentine
[1:01:35] <+TopTieramisu> she's not gonna make it
[1:01:37] <drawie_holly> day
[1:01:42] <+TopTieramisu> LUL
[1:01:43] <%Lion_kun> DS3 Nameless
[1:01:44] <+TopTieramisu> dammit
[1:01:50] <Vermillion129> there's winged spear somewhere here right?
[1:01:52] <%G_Thunders> @scaryboisupreme nah I agree with that. Soundtrack and visuals are amazing, but actually fighting them not so much
[1:01:52] <%Lion_kun> Bloodborne Ludwig
[1:01:59] <%Lion_kun> Sekiro Isshin
[1:02:05] <scaryboisupreme> Dark Souls 3 tries too hard to be Bloodborne 2
[1:02:09] <Coystick> Thinking about it, I'd say top 3 are Sword Saint, Ludwig, annnnnd Manus.
[1:02:11] <NireFuster> Ohohohoho
[1:02:16] <%RayReborne> oh yeah no ostrava down here cuz he deadedy dead dead
[1:02:18] <+ClericOfSparda> I only played BB and DS3 and my favorite was the Abyss watchers
[1:02:24] <+Bailey__Gaming> I like the dlc bosses in 1 and 3!
[1:02:36] <scaryboisupreme> Best fight in Dark Souls 2 is Sir Alonne
[1:02:40] <thatdudenamedlogan> Cyberdog 2077
[1:02:40] <+Bailey__Gaming> dog tech disabled
[1:02:45] <+ReallyBigRocks> LUL
[1:02:46] <+TopTieramisu> in all soulsborne? orphan, ludwig, lady maria
[1:02:54] <TurtlesAndTentacles> it's cool
[1:02:56] <drawie_holly> midir rules
[1:02:57] <+PrimalDweeb> Shield up Paige!
[1:02:59] <%RayReborne> Abyss Watchers is my fav out of all the games ive played in soulsborne
[1:03:04] <+ReallyBigRocks> the real dog tech is the borks
[1:03:05] <scaryboisupreme> OKay Midir is pretty good
[1:03:07] <%RayReborne> its just Rad as fuck
[1:03:09] <scaryboisupreme> cause it's Shin Godzilla
[1:03:20] <+PrimalDweeb> Good job!
[1:03:21] <Coystick> I didn't fight Orphan or Midir enough to appreciate them
[1:03:25] <drawie_holly> it IS shin godzilla
[1:03:27] <+Emperor_Machinus> DS2 White tigers?
[1:03:28] <%Lion_kun> I just beat Midir and Gael in under 5 tries
[1:03:30] <Cozy90> Hey pat how well do you think Reggie will do in elden ring?
[1:03:35] <%Lion_kun> It felt gooooood
[1:03:40] <%superc37> AGAIN
[1:03:46] <RushUnplugged> WOLF. WITH SWORD. that's it
[1:03:47] <NireFuster> BIG DOG, BIG SWORD, 10/10 design
[1:03:51] <+UltraViolet371> Gief's role model, it's why he keeps going for the knives
[1:03:51] <%superc37> MARIA AND ARTORIAS ARE PRETTY UP THERE
[1:03:56] <+Bailey__Gaming> other than living failures and that mushroom one, bloodbourne has no ba bosses
[1:04:00] <%rumtumtugnutz> Swordd Wolf is a BILF
[1:04:08] <+TopTieramisu> sif really suffers from having big blind spots by his legs
[1:04:13] <+Bailey__Gaming> they all rule super hard
[1:04:14] <%rumtumtugnutz> Is that Gollum
[1:04:14] <scaryboisupreme> Lady Maria is kinda lame cause yeah the character is cool but she's pure parry bait and is a pushover
[1:04:22] <drawie_holly> oh yeah amygdala rules
[1:04:22] <+Mendin> is Paige popping her lips every so often or is my computer going insane
[1:04:26] <%RayReborne> present ass for proper stabbing Kappa
[1:04:29] <+chiazam> Why did Sif want to kill you so bad?
[1:04:29] <+ReallyBigRocks> boletaria is cancelled?!1? :O
[1:04:32] <huskarl_zap> pat sus
[1:04:35] <%superc37> @bailey__gaming even then theyre not rly "poorly designed" bad, just kinda easier compared to the others
[1:04:36] <NireFuster> pop pop
[1:04:37] <+Mendin> #BoletariaIsOverParty
[1:04:38] <%Dakuu75> Dakuu75 is continuing the Gift Sub they got from ForneusAtSeaWorld! 
[1:04:39] <Coystick> Living Failures almost works, they're like Pinwheel if you fought them earlier they'd be fine early game bosses
[1:04:49] <drawie_holly> gascoine is also great
[1:04:53] <+Mendin> Not bothering me, I just wanted to make sure I wasn't receiving secret messages on my computer
[1:04:55] <Slimeking_Mike> :| :o :| :o
[1:05:01] <+TopTieramisu> fight lady maria without parrying. then it's great fun
[1:05:14] <Coystick> I think Gascoigne is the best "1st boss" in the series by a mile
[1:05:23] <+Bailey__Gaming> @superc37 I can not complain about any bb boss
[1:05:26] <randomlyalwaystired> @scaryboisupreme Same with Gwyn from DS1, but in his case, it adds more to his character and lore
[1:05:27] <+MisterAvry> great now I'm can-canning
[1:05:29] <scaryboisupreme> yeah, Gascoigne is the best first boss you can get
[1:05:34] <+TopTieramisu> for last bosses, i'd say gehrman is my favorite
[1:05:36] <Hydrapissed> pat yells from the distance
[1:05:49] <+Arek_1> Broadsword and Claymore are pretty noteworthy.
[1:05:55] <livehardman> catch a Wingull
[1:05:58] <BigFingerRo> Peach, you may one day get that second ass on top for your current ass that you want, but believe you me, Pat's trashbags-kissing ass is unfortunately out of reach for you, as is for most humans
[1:05:59] <Coystick> @TopTieramisu Not in a world where Sword Saint exists
[1:06:03] <scaryboisupreme> All the hunter bosses on Bloodborne suffer from the same problem of once you learn their movies, you can just parry them to death
[1:06:09] <Slimeking_Mike> @Bailey__Gaming Really? Can't even complain about the Amygdala in the Cursed Chalice?
[1:06:16] <+TopTieramisu> true. isshin is great. but i do think the atmosphere is greater for gehrman
[1:06:34] <udurbalanced> Save that Valentine's day talk for post stream
[1:06:38] <+MisterAvry> imagine getting chopped down by someone who didn't even see you when she came up the stairs
[1:06:39] <+TopTieramisu> your fighting in an area that was your safe area the whole game and the music is fantastic
[1:06:40] <livehardman> gehrman have cool scythe
[1:06:44] <+TopTieramisu> you're*
[1:06:57] <Coystick> Father Gas and Sword Saint Isshy are like bookends of perfection
[1:07:04] <+TopTieramisu> LUL

[1:07:26] <+Bailey__Gaming> @slimeking_mike I got platinum and didn't realy have issue other than Orphan but in terms of game play and design they are all bangers
[1:07:28] <+TopTieramisu> the rains of castamere

[1:07:40] <devanmuse> You got shot worse than that guy from the beginning of Akira
[1:07:45] <@SoFarFetched> Nah youre good.
[1:07:47] <%RayReborne> Bikey man from a Bikey gang?

[1:08:19] <@SoFarFetched> animated emote: paige popping.
[1:08:19] <Shacklebox> The dog is stealing all the mouth moisture
[1:08:24] <+chiazam> Popping makes your mouth less dry?
[1:08:24] <randomlyalwaystired> When did the popping noise become hated?
[1:08:33] <huskarl_zap> laynaPop
[1:08:34] <+Arek_1> @kimo313 The original, yeah.
[1:08:43] <+derpmandwn999> Stuff is giod
[1:08:54] <Slimeking_Mike> @Bailey__Gaming well then fair's fair, glad you liked it all!
[1:09:01] <Hydrapissed> get her some pedealite
[1:09:05] <+ReefTheWizard> brinG T H E J U G
[1:09:12] <NireFuster> Right in front of god, how embarassing
[1:09:27] <+MisterAvry> everyone reading this hydrate yourselves
[1:09:45] <drawie_holly> i think i’m gonna play elden ring with no shield so i die a lot
[1:09:46] <+ReefTheWizard> @MisterAvry dont tell me what to do
[1:09:57] <drawie_holly> it’s fu
[1:10:05] <drawie_holly> it’s fun to be bad at souls
[1:10:12] <+Bailey__Gaming> we need a hydrate channel point rewards I have 32k point to use
[1:10:13] <%SophiaAmoreaVeritas> Dark Souls, Beta Build
[1:10:19] <+TopTieramisu> i wonder how close to Guts you can become in Elden Ring
[1:10:29] <+PrimalDweeb> The silver is weaker
[1:10:46] <randomlyalwaystired> @drawie_holly just become a barehanded parry god! Youll do fine!
[1:10:50] <+UltraViolet371> Less damage, gives some extra MP I believe
[1:10:53] <%RayReborne> 119
[1:10:59] <BigFingerRo> Elden Ring should say "You're*" and "Don't you lecture me with your 30 dollar haircut" when you die
[1:11:06] <Latija> silver gives more mp, wooden does more damage, i think
[1:11:14] <@SoFarFetched> laynaPop laynaPop laynaPop
[1:11:17] <+ReefTheWizard> is demon souls easier or harder than dark souls
[1:11:21] <+TopTieramisu> easier
[1:11:26] <+TopTieramisu> but it has more obtuse mechanics
[1:11:32] <drawie_holly> @randomlyalwaystired  nah i want to die
[1:11:42] <drawie_holly> masochism time
[1:11:44] <tanarath> Damage
[1:11:45] <+ReefTheWizard> @TopTieramisu ah, classic
[1:11:50] <+UltraViolet371> oh boy
[1:12:08] <+ReefTheWizard> piss him off
[1:12:16] <+ReallyBigRocks> kick his ass
[1:12:16] <+UltraViolet371> and you will NOT get a drake sword
[1:12:16] <+kimo313> you can also do it melee
[1:12:19] <+PrimalDweeb> But you get dragon soul
[1:12:25] <huskarl_zap> buy 99 wooden bolts
[1:12:26] <randomlyalwaystired> @drawie_holly #gamergoalscomplete lol
[1:12:28] <+Arek_1> Or you can cut at its tail at the beginning of the trail with the Dragon Bone Crusher.
[1:12:33] <+ReefTheWizard> gonna have to be better than that
[1:12:49] <+mrcake_dragonman> Heya @PeachSaliva long time no see!
[1:12:57] <linSP> 15 minutes of dragon screech to get 20k souls i think
[1:13:14] <+Arek_1> Dragon Bone Smasher*. You would use its R2.
[1:13:26] <+TopTieramisu> i will say one thing. demon's souls doesn't have a lost izalith to bring it down
[1:13:28] <+ReefTheWizard> she doesnt wanna shoot the dragon 200+ times. its like she doesnt even souls
[1:13:52] <NireFuster> I love that she calls them ''bad men'' all the time lol

[1:41:51] <WillSin4Cash> Achilles is the weakness cause tower jn8ght ghey?
[1:41:55] <NireFuster> FUCKING TANKED IT
[1:41:58] <NireFuster> like a champ
[1:42:01] <%holydeviant1> Woah, I just woke up for this!
[1:42:04] <juan_wu_tamad> that block was pretty sick ngl
[1:42:06] <jetpack_rorschasch> That's not a hint Pat, everyone's gay in ancient Greece. E V E R Y O N E ! KappaPride
[1:42:15] <BigFingerRo> NO DAMAGE
[1:42:16] <+Undenizen> is "go for ankles" a necessary hint? it's the only part of him you can reach
[1:42:19] <RyuuAoi> @doc_ock_rokc Same doe
[1:42:25] <+realm_forge> God I wanna make that shield.....
[1:42:27] <+TopTieramisu> god the effects are so cool
[1:42:30] <%holydeviant1> fuck I love the tower knight
[1:42:33] <$Trenr> god this boss is so good
[1:42:34] <+Bouerd> I love the sound design here to much
[1:42:38] <NireFuster> I love the sound design of this
[1:42:44] <NireFuster> The armor clanking around is super satisfying
[1:42:44] <@SoFarFetched> @Undenizen with how blind paige is? Absolutely.
[1:42:47] <%holydeviant1> "armored man with weapon. but B I G"
[1:42:50] <+realm_forge> I would love to cosplay this boss
[1:42:54] <+Felhad> Where did they even get such a lrg boi
[1:42:58] <TurtlesAndTentacles> I feel like Paige becomes coward at the wrong time
[1:43:00] <BigFingerRo> man, Peach just doesn't do well with rolling under bosses eh?
[1:43:04] <umbranviking> FrankerZ
[1:43:05] <TurtlesAndTentacles> she's super good at this
[1:43:11] <+Undenizen> @Bouerd all over, the sound design on this is doing SO much work on this remake
[1:43:14] <juan_wu_tamad> what if there was a tarkus to assist here
[1:43:24] <%RayReborne> wrong way lol
[1:43:26] <+TopTieramisu> don't forget the haptic feedback
[1:43:29] <$TheGoodTimeGirl> i hate the sound design of this remake, everything is just so noisy
[1:43:32] <RyuuAoi> Fuck HIM in the ass, Peach!
[1:43:32] <+TopTieramisu> wonderfully implemented
[1:43:33] <NireFuster> Only thing about the sound design I don't like is the magic
[1:43:36] <NireFuster> Sounds way too sci fi
[1:43:38] <+doc_ock_rokc> @juan_wu_tamad Tarkus is to manly to appear here
[1:43:40] <NireFuster> It does not sound like magic at all
[1:43:41] <BigFingerRo> HIT THOSE BALLS PEACHES
[1:43:55] <+TopTieramisu> magic pixel
[1:43:56] <BigFingerRo> OH
[1:43:57] <+Felhad> What does magic sound like?
[1:43:59] <baka_sugoi> POKE HARDER
[1:43:59] <+Undenizen> @NireFuster what does magic sound like? wind chimes??
[1:44:14] <juan_wu_tamad> @doc_ock_rokc u right, tarkus would trivialize the goons on the sides
[1:44:18] <RyuuAoi> Keep rollin rollin rollin
[1:44:20] <%Keyd00d> magic sounds like shweeeen
[1:44:21] <+TopTieramisu> she blocked the shockwave
[1:44:25] <%Keyd00d> and nyooooom
[1:44:28] <NireFuster> It doesn't sound anything like the magic from the rest of the series
[1:44:31] <Daxalog> So why is there just a big guy here?
[1:44:31] <%G_Thunders> It sounds like Harry Potter magic. Which isn’t a bad thing it actually sounds like there’s force behind it
[1:44:38] <juan_wu_tamad> nice blockin paige!
[1:44:41] <+TopTieramisu> because paige killed the archers
[1:44:47] <juan_wu_tamad> B I G AND S T R O N G

[1:46:05] <NireFuster> BIG DAMAGE
[1:46:10] <cloakofashes> Not the shield.
[1:46:13] <%FacetiousAF> round 2 tho
[1:46:15] <+UltraViolet371> it'd be awesome if someone using coward strats had tower knight pull out some new moon grass
[1:46:15] <%Keyd00d> big man big fall
[1:46:26] <BigFingerRo> The coward corner
[1:46:28] <@SoFarFetched> @NireFuster I mean that makes sense since its not the same studio. I dont think FromSoft would let them have their sound board to use.
[1:46:29] <huskarl_zap> who the fuck was walking around the fog gate?
[1:46:36] <%Agami23> i wonder if throwing fire at his head is good
[1:46:45] <zhenthrim213> its ok im a coward too
[1:46:53] <Estwilde> get em !
[1:46:56] <+TopTieramisu> @Felhad remaking a game is nothing like making a game themselves

[1:47:00] <Estwilde> Nice!
[1:47:01] <BigFingerRo> Oh wow, he just falls over
[1:47:03] <juan_wu_tamad> TWIST HIS DICK!
[1:47:05] <+notsoy> lol
[1:47:06] <NireFuster> @SoFarFetched Yeah but it's more about the spells sounding super different rather than not being the exact same. They give me more sci fi laser beam vibes than magic personally
[1:47:07] <RyuuAoi> You doing it though!
[1:47:09] <+PrimalDweeb> Go for it's nuts! It's nuts!
[1:47:09] <Treasure_Vault> his legs don't take the big damage when he's on the ground, right?
[1:47:12] <Estwilde> That works. Keep it up!

[1:56:08] <%legendfather_of_giants> @PeachSaliva pure white takes 3 points, 1-1 boss adds 1 point to all zones, now she has 2 points for Boletaria
[1:56:11] <+PrimalDweeb> Congrats, you self deleted.
[1:56:12] <Pookiedaexzile> Tore up here ankussy
[1:56:18] <+realm_forge> Do a flip for Jesus
[1:56:18] <Mrbaconator> was that beating your wife at video games an aunty donna it sounds like one
[1:56:24] <Soulsbjorne> No.
[1:56:26] <%RayReborne> yes? looks like it to me
[1:56:26] <%legendfather_of_giants> NO it isnt
[1:56:26] <+GinAndRoses> no
[1:56:26] <Rumbutt> pure white is 3 bosses
[1:56:26] <+Deekman> no
[1:56:27] <juan_wu_tamad> if only it did the looney toons crater when they fell from such a height
[1:56:28] <+PrimalDweeb> It's close
[1:56:28] <Latija> she killed ostrava
[1:56:30] <huskarl_zap> it might be putlre white for Valentine's day because they did that in the original game
[1:56:30] <%holydeviant1> Imagine being Thomas and just sorting your shit out, when someone just fucking falls from the damn sky
[1:56:31] <%vivaciouseff> whiter, but not pure
[1:56:32] <lexitheshark> I think there's one more to go
[1:56:34] <razethetek> ppL
[1:56:38] <28moogles> Or kill an invader
[1:56:41] <Soulsbjorne> pure white has sparkles
[1:56:42] <%legendfather_of_giants> @PeachSaliva 1-1 boss adds 1 point to all areas
[1:56:46] <Pookiedaexzile> Looking at an AMerican "Is that pure white"
[1:56:47] <Lazy_Vagabond> Archstone 1 is different because more bosses
[1:56:50] <+Deekman> she could coop and beat a boss in 1:1
[1:56:52] <Vermillion129> black phantom kill +1 white
[1:56:59] <+UltraViolet371> of all the changes, why'd they not make this screen any clearer
[1:57:07] <linSP> let us invade you and give you free white world
[1:57:08] <+Etherealizer> I'm glad they ditched this mechanic lol
[1:57:09] <+PrimalDweeb> Either way, that other area in 1-1 should be open now.
[1:57:13] <%legendfather_of_giants> archstone 1 isn't actually different, Phalanx is
[1:57:39] <Pookiedaexzile> Shield plus Magic
[1:57:57] <Dieworc> We can do without your face
