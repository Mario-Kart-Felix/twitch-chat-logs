[1:11:22] <%Jpdodds> its not
[1:11:22] <%TombstoneTTromboners> or maybe it's
[1:11:23] <%QuadraticGravity> "Sequel to genocide"
[1:11:24] <%TombstoneTTromboners> something else
[1:11:24] <%QuadraticGravity> lmfao
[1:11:25] <%Admiral_PopnFresh> Wait Undertale got DLC?
[1:11:26] <%The_Dark_Gods> she's so certain on this theory
[1:11:27] <%AncelDeLambert> there's zero evidence it is
[1:11:33] <%Keyd00d> lol you know nothing about the game yet
[1:11:34] <%Toynota10> Dont worry im sure Pat's wrong
[1:11:35] <%jiin6> BTW, think Standalone story
[1:11:37] <%QuadraticGravity> You guys made stuff up super hard and are doubling down on it
[1:11:38] <%SlugNut> Does't everyone die in genocide including Toriel and Undyne?
[1:11:40] <%jackofadequacy> it might not be
[1:11:41] <%UncannyMatt> You're really jumping the gun right off the bat
[1:11:49] <%ArtemisM822> Pat is probably wrong though
[1:11:49] <@mothmandraws> spook
[1:11:52] <%mistymntns> The world is coming alive now that you are here!
[1:11:52] <%bread_assassin> I wonder if something happens if you beat everything without saving. No one tell me, though.
[1:11:55] <%Hamtacular> Gun jumping of the highest calibre
[1:12:01] <%AncelDeLambert> [CRAZY TALK]
[1:12:01] <@danzig2> just keep playing, it only gets more confusing

[1:12:23] <@MelBrooksKA> Guys. if you keep wildly speculating, you're gonna look like jackasses at the end of this
[1:12:25] <@mothmandraws> pat takes 2 steps into game "this is same walk pattern as the genocide run"
[1:12:26] <%The_Dark_Gods> go down first
[1:12:27] <%umbypokochan> lol it looks the same
[1:12:29] <%The_Dark_Gods> right is progress
[1:12:29] <%superc37> No thats crazy talk idiots, that was an ending.
[1:12:30] <%AncelDeLambert> I think it's fair to say you should enter this game with NO expectations
[1:12:31] <redginger666> down
[1:12:37] <%AncelDeLambert> Assume NOTHING
[1:12:45] <%superc37> sorry, thats NOT crazy talk is what i meant to say
[1:13:02] <%jiin6> welcome to the Tutorial ISEKAI FIELDS
[1:13:03] <%The_Dark_Gods> assume everything, have expectations to break
[1:13:05] <%x24sonic> hey pat is super wrong about the timeline

[1:29:48] <%bloodypurpledog> pee as a unit
[1:29:49] <%SuperCasualBoom> Underpiss
[1:29:50] <@MelBrooksKA> @Volta_Bass I don't think that'd turn out well
[1:29:52] <%NWR_James> Pat make the noise!
[1:29:58] <%KaosMachina> I was gonna play this but then I didn't so I'm watching you chucklefucks
[1:29:58] <@Volta_Bass> Of course. Peeing together is the best my dudes
[1:30:05] <%SSaryn> Shit and piss everywhere. Or just Batwing right now.
[1:30:06] <%The_Dark_Gods> Pat just be cool
[1:30:12] <%Mornaka> @PeachSaliva im getting druhnk because i just finished a 12 hour work day
[1:30:14] <%UncannyMatt> Help her pee she's dying
[1:30:17] <%Stereotreme> synchronous peeing is a sign of true enlightenment
[1:30:17] <%acousticdonuts> hey volta, when you pee together, do you cross the streams
[1:30:20] <%Big_Dream> she went upstairs to eat your cookie dough pat
[1:30:21] <%RaikenTB> Get any trick or treaters?
[1:30:22] <%SlugNut> Tell who what?
[1:30:25] <@MelBrooksKA> @Volta_Bass Please don't pee in those group troughs
[1:30:27] <%asgard147> kay
[1:30:27] <%NWR_James> TELL EVERYONE YOU KNOW
[1:30:29] <%PlayKingdomHeartsGames> Pat I was already halfway through RE1 when II heard you say on the podcast Directors Cut is ass, help
[1:30:30] <%Itselguapo> ooooo I hope Toby Fox doesn't find this! Or he will kills you guys
[1:30:30] <%ssjklyco> Trick paige into uninstalling it
[1:30:49] <%SuperCasualBoom> I think you miss my donation post back there
[1:30:53] <@mothmandraws> watch toby fox has some program that scans your pc to see if you talked about the game, and auto sends a cease and desist
[1:30:59] <%Hamtacular> The music is still strong af
[1:31:07] <%KaosMachina> I think this might be the Earthbound/Mother 2 to Undertale's Mother 1
[1:31:09] <%iwishthiswasicq> Oh, I forgot I was a sub and can still talk.
[1:31:10] <awsomesaucekirby> cheer232 why sub only?
[1:31:15] <%ssjklyco> Now that youre a home owner, you're the house people throw eggs at for not giving out candy.
[1:31:18] <@mothmandraws> so we can keep track of spoilers
[1:31:23] <%Admiral_PopnFresh> I made a LARP sword tonight, gonna be dueling nerds on Saturday
[1:31:25] <%NWR_James> spoilers
[1:31:26] <%TombstoneTTromboners> makes sense
[1:31:29] <%RaikenTB> It could be the original Director's Cut version which had the good soundtrack.
[1:31:33] <@MelBrooksKA> Did you pick up any candy for yourselves tonight?
[1:31:34] <%PlayKingdomHeartsGames> Nah I've been playing both because I need to see the way it started. Plus this acting is hysterical I love it
[1:31:34] <%duneblythe> I am playing Dark Souls 2. The drop your shield thing is very useful, thanks.
[1:31:37] <%VeryTricky> what stops a sub from spoiling?
[1:31:37] <%KaosMachina> That's the vibe I'm getting
[1:31:37] <%bread_assassin> Why the Gamecube one over the newer one? @PeachSaliva
[1:31:41] <%RaikenTB> only dualshock has the ass one.
[1:31:43] <%SleepyMaribo> Pat FYI there is a super boss in the demo and he is BULLSHIT
[1:31:43] <%iwishthiswasicq> @VeryTricky A ban
[1:31:49] <%NWR_James> clowns farting in the basement > this
[1:31:49] <@mothmandraws> so no one spoils it to pat and paige that bowsette kills papyrus
[1:31:54] <%Hamtacular> Chat is slower, so easier to catch/ban I guess
[1:32:13] <@thenefftw> That was me
[1:32:20] <%Admiral_PopnFresh> Oh wow
[1:32:20] <%Djinnazz> you just noticed?
[1:32:22] <%Shadowpint> I'm watching you and Woolie play Bloodborne, I kinda have to cuz I'm too shit at the game
[1:32:24] <%AlvinTheLiar> Piss with determination Pat
[1:32:24] <%Toynota10> It was a very wise decision
[1:32:24] <%SSaryn> Shit was getting rough Nef?
[1:32:27] <%UncannyMatt> It's for the greater good
[1:32:29] <%The_Dark_Gods> it's only been just an hour :U
[1:32:31] <%QuadraticGravity> @mothmandraws i mean people have been trying to lowkey spoil the entire time already
[1:32:31] <%AmericanaRed> sipsipHellmo sipsipHellmo we rule
[1:32:31] <%acousticdonuts> the greater good
[1:32:32] <%SlugNut> I think it's a good call. Not perfect but a good middle ground.
[1:32:32] <%iwishthiswasicq> I trust any decision made by any mod that isn't SSaryn.
[1:32:35] <%edited156> PUT IT AWAY PAT
[1:32:38] <%Dakuu75> I understand you coaxed 4.99 outa me so I could yell at you un-abaited so. i'm fine with it
[1:32:39] <%edited156> NO DICKWINGS
[1:32:39] <%SSaryn> HEY
[1:32:39] <%UncannyMatt> Put it away...?
[1:32:39] <%Neryl_> More to cut down on the wha?
[1:32:41] <%NWR_James> ...
[1:32:41] <%TombstoneTTromboners> can't believe thenefftw is going to be dishonorably discharged from his mod position
[1:32:42] <@thenefftw> @SSaryn It's to make certain it doesn't
[1:32:43] <%SSaryn> IM A GOOD MOD DAMN IT
[1:32:43] <%Retrocop87> sipsipHellmo sipsipHellmo sipsipHellmo
[1:32:44] <%Toynota10> I enjoy sub only mode a lot more
[1:32:45] <%RadRegice> I WANT TO SEE WHATEVER THE BAT WINGS ARE
[1:32:50] <%ssjklyco> Yeah, suck it Unsubbed people!
[1:32:52] <%Neryl_> Oof.
[1:32:53] <%Jpdodds> The hardest choices require the stronges of wills
[1:32:54] <%SuperCasualBoom> Put your dick away Pat
[1:32:56] <%bthevboi> "this shits fucked"
[1:33:02] <%bbHighvalor> Pat BIG DICK
[1:33:04] <%MrBorisMakarov> danGun2 here you go @SSaryn
[1:33:05] <%Djinnazz> @Shadowpint Dud, PEACH beat that game, you can do it.
[1:33:06] <%marsano168> surprisingly i've noticed people are keeping really good with Toby asking to keep spoilers to a minimum
[1:33:07] <%acousticdonuts> shit's fucked cap'n
[1:33:09] <%QuadraticGravity> @PeachSaliva Stop listening to pat
[1:33:11] <%Admiral_PopnFresh> I guess it makes sense, the crowd you two attract is REALLY rowdy for it's size
[1:33:12] <%SergeEXE> when did subs become $6
[1:33:17] <%Toynota10> @peachsaliva you have any questions about gameplay or anything else?
[1:33:17] <%TombstoneTTromboners> is it???
[1:33:19] <%Jpdodds> susie was gonna eat your face
[1:33:21] <@MelBrooksKA> You should probably stop wildly speculating...
[1:33:23] <%Jpdodds> You arent
[1:33:25] <%Faustgesicht> So is this an official release of toy fox?
[1:33:25] <%Jpdodds> and its not
[1:33:26] <%UncannyMatt> Why do you believe that?
[1:33:26] <@mothmandraws> ppl will be annoyed they cant talk, but they would be more annoyed if a cool moment gets spoiled
[1:33:27] <%Dakuu75> I don't think it's fucking "clearly" anything atm, you don't know shit
[1:33:30] <%iwishthiswasicq> I hope this game has nothing to do with Undertale and Toby just reused designs and names.
[1:33:30] <@Calek> she's probably not reading chat
[1:33:30] <%QuadraticGravity> @TombstoneTTromboners It's not, pat made shit up and convinced her
[1:33:31] <%x24sonic> it's a parallel timeline
[1:33:31] <%RadRegice> that is a big speculation that doesn't seem correct
[1:33:32] <%Itselguapo> your neither of them.... your Kris
[1:33:34] <%SSaryn> Paige has to give the GUN for me to GUN in here.
[1:33:35] <%SlugNut> If you're Chara, how are characters alive that Chara killed in that run?
[1:33:37] <%The_Dark_Gods> big assumptions
[1:33:38] <%topendbuzz> might just be au
[1:33:42] <%The_Dark_Gods> like, the biggliest
[1:33:44] <%x24sonic> it's not chara!!!!!
[1:33:46] <%QuadraticGravity> BIG BIG LIES AND GUN JUMPING
[1:33:47] <%TombstoneTTromboners> @QuadraticGravity yeah i know i'm just being goofy
[1:33:49] <%Dakuu75> WHY the fuck would this be chara?
[1:33:49] <%SergeEXE> The best part is we dont know
[1:33:50] <%x24sonic> it's AU
[1:33:52] <%SSaryn> That's some big ass assumptions boi
[1:33:56] <%Mogel56> Susie looks like the angry dummy lol
[1:34:01] <%jackofadequacy> I don't think it's a sequel
[1:34:01] <%Jpdodds> IF ITS CHARA WHY IS UNDYNE ALIEV
[1:34:02] <%marsano168> Guys relax speculation is half the fun!
[1:34:02] <%QuadraticGravity> Remember the thought process where pat made shit up
[1:34:03] <@mothmandraws> @PeachSaliva stop discussing the game, toby will turn up at your house
[1:34:05] <%topendbuzz> might be an au
[1:34:06] <%ssjklyco> It's probably just like how FF, Zelda, and Breath of Fire are different games with similar aspects of the previous games.
[1:34:07] <%umbypokochan> the drugs are making her believe things that aren't even suggested lol
[1:34:09] <%Jpdodds> why is undyne alive
[1:34:09] <%Toynota10> I wonder how many years in the future this game is
[1:34:09] <%CappuccinoGuil> I feel AU theory is a good one
[1:34:11] <%Dakuu75> who said this was "chara" like... where is this ass-sumption coming from? lol for real
[1:34:14] <%RadRegice> i don't know where the genocide idea is coming from when there were characters from the first game alive in the beginning
[1:34:15] <%x24sonic> TELL PATRICK HE IS EXTREMELY WRONG ABOUT THE TIMELINE
[1:34:17] <%bthevboi> dont spoil the mystery
[1:34:31] <%Djinnazz> CRAZY TALK.
[1:34:31] <%TombstoneTTromboners> only sans undertale has returned
[1:34:34] <%TombstoneTTromboners> and now he's the bad guy

[1:34:43] <%x24sonic> @Djinnazz crazy talk.
[1:34:44] <%OrochiSheewa> I'm still not convinced this is the full game
[1:34:46] <%Admiral_PopnFresh> blobDance I'm swaying to this waltz
[1:34:58] <%KaosMachina> I'm saying this again, this is the Earthbound to Undertale's Mother 1- it's not literally the same characters with rare exceptions, but it's going to be the same archetypes and _some_ of the same beats
[1:35:02] <%x24sonic> @OrochiSheewa it's "chapter 1"
[1:35:02] <%Stereotreme> never stop shooting the elderly. they know what they did.

[1:44:47] <%DrWolpertinger> gottem
[1:44:48] <%CappuccinoGuil> can you Lecture and Pacify in the same turn to defeat him automatically?

[1:45:01] <+SomeOtherNeb> LUL
[1:45:11] <%NWR_James> "Lancer was here. Kris is a loser"
[1:45:25] <%SoarFlyer> thrash me daddy
[1:45:28] <%SSaryn> If you do know you can make the enemies name blue or yellow, yes you can use Spare or Pacify
[1:45:43] <%The_Dark_Gods> is Field of Hopes and Dreams a remix of Hopes and Dreams?
[1:45:47] <%The_Dark_Gods> really?
[1:45:53] <%x24sonic> who could have guessed
[1:45:55] <%SergeEXE> LUL
[1:45:55] <%SSaryn> Yeah
[1:46:04] <%raziel391> Pat check Kris' cape
[1:46:05] <%DGenerator> You can pre-spare enemies as Ralsei moves second
[1:46:08] <@mothmandraws> pat just a trcik you can cue up an act then spare
[1:46:17] <%TombstoneTTromboners> no spare with ralsei
[1:46:19] <%The_Dark_Gods> you know
[1:46:21] <%The_Dark_Gods> he has meme eyes
[1:46:27] <%x24sonic> paige is right

[1:46:28] <%TombstoneTTromboners> only Kris can ACT
[1:46:31] <%Mornaka> SPARE WITH RALSEI
[1:46:43] <%Admiral_PopnFresh> This encounter music also reminds me of a remix of Asgore
[1:46:51] <%Dakuu75> can't believe how chicken-shit paige is to fight AT ALL, interesting. to the point where it scares her
[1:46:53] <%SSaryn> Yeah you can combo it
[1:46:55] <%umbypokochan> C O M B O
[1:46:57] <%SleepyMaribo> COMBOS!

[1:47:04] <%SergeEXE> DO COMBO
[1:47:07] <%redstonej> COMBO BREAKER
[1:47:10] <+Shikari21> man its real annoying the aversion to fighting
[1:47:10] <%jackofadequacy> big combo
[1:47:11] <%SSaryn> Itll help a LOT later.
[1:47:30] <@Calek> @Dakuu75 considering in the first game where killing one enemy locks you out of the true ending, you can understand her waryness
[1:47:35] <%Big_Dream> good night enjoy backwards undertale

[1:49:10] <%SSaryn> I cant believe Steve Fox stole Toby Foxs idea for a game Kappa
[1:49:12] <%marsano168> Time is convoluted in Lordran Pat
[1:49:13] <%NWR_James> The Majora's Mask of Undertale?
[1:49:15] <%QuadraticGravity> @Aitch971 They're really really fucking awful at that though
[1:49:18] <%ArtemisM822> Speaking of which, where are our skeleton friends?
[1:49:20] <%Coystick> So is this a full game or nah?
[1:49:20] <%crowsloft77> Most awkward uber eats order was when the guy came with his family
[1:49:20] <%Stereotreme> as someone who formerly commuted about 3 hours daily, can confirm. drivers are morons.
[1:49:24] <@mothmandraws> ask woolie
[1:49:24] <%OrochiSheewa> oh i just noticed, that kris is cyan, the color you choose at the start
[1:49:26] <%TheImmortal70> @NWR_James You know you're really not wrong

[1:49:39] <%The_Dark_Gods> Kris is always blue

[1:49:43] <%QuadraticGravity> @Dakuu75 This came out over twelve hours ago
[1:49:46] <@mothmandraws> most of mods have finished it

[1:50:43] <%SoarFlyer> Kris' icon looks like 2B
[1:50:43] <%KaosMachina> You fought a spade themed guy, now you're fighting diamond themed characters and now there's a heart themed one
[1:50:45] <%umbypokochan> i feel like every battle is a Final Fantasy back attack
[1:50:48] <%UncannyMatt> YEAH THAT MAKES SENSE
[1:50:51] <%JackMillerTime> diamond and heart
[1:50:54] <%TheImmortal70> You can GRIND Tp

[1:51:03] <%TombstoneTTromboners> what could these symbols mean...
[1:51:04] <%SSaryn> I would mod but Paige hates me and my money to fund her McDs Kappa
[1:51:05] <%TheImmortal70> It's a great addition to the original system of combat
[1:51:08] <%KaosMachina> yes there is Dakuu

[1:54:22] <%Dakuu75> I bet opening and taking that ribon is gonna lead to someone saying "someone stole my ribon from the chest I left in the middle of the empty field"
[1:54:24] <%Hamtacular> CUTENESS GO UP
[1:54:26] <%Mornaka> KAWAII GO UP
[1:54:27] <%UncannyMatt> Is there special dialogue for putting it on him?
[1:54:33] <%TheImmortal70> You bet your ass there is
[1:54:34] <evilchicken713> Am I the only one who sees Ralsei’s portrait having big horrible Jinx/Blackface lips?
[1:54:36] <%x24sonic> GIVE IT TO RALSEIIIIIIII
[1:54:42] <%Dakuu75> no
[1:54:46] <%x24sonic> rude
[1:54:46] <%Vascune> it was a dirty ribbon
[1:54:52] <%bevyrage> red ribbon
[1:54:53] <%SSaryn> @peachsaliva Put it on fluffy boi
[1:54:53] <%KaosMachina> This is like homestuck
[1:54:57] <%SlugNut> Fun tidbit, I gave it to Ralsei and there was a cute dialogue.
[1:55:02] <%KaosMachina> everyone going "IS THIS A REFERNECE TO <THING>"
[1:55:02] <%QuadraticGravity> Just going to start counting every gun jump that happens
[1:55:19] <%ssjklyco> DeltaRune is Paige and Pats full game of "Is this Anor Londo?"

[1:56:34] <%TheImmortal70> @peachsaliva Go for the three stooges
[1:56:36] <%NWR_James> Ralsei is sassy
[1:56:56] <%Itselguapo> the way Ralsei bows down when he acts, it reminds of Geno when he does his Geno blast.
[1:57:00] <%UncannyMatt> Kris does the Jotaro pose
[1:57:08] <%TheImmortal70> Knowing that Geno does that, that's gotta be a reference.
[1:57:11] <%TheImmortal70> That's just how this game is
[1:57:19] <%marsano168> @Dakuu75 let them have their speculative fun lol

[1:59:02] <%Dakuu75> I don't feel i'm being any worse than anyone else
[1:59:19] <@mothmandraws> I think this game has better general music for walking through areas (apart from the snow one)
[1:59:19] <%TheImmortal70> Even the phrase, "worse than anyone else" Is inherently negative
[1:59:37] <%yeeyeyee> if paige doesn't eat mcdonald's she dies, but eating mcdonald's kills her over time
[1:59:41] <%yeeyeyee> it's just a matter of dying slower
[1:59:45] <%TheImmortal70> I think it's easy to say so far this game has equal or better music
[1:59:47] <@Calek> @Dakuu75 you are who I am noticing so just chill and just let them have fun

[2:16:09] <%GarbageNirvana> Real talk tho this battle theme bang
[2:16:13] <%GarbageNirvana> s
[2:16:35] <%jiin6> the last guys so much like us
[2:16:43] <%TheImmortal70> Alright so Susie's special ability was S-Flatter in that one fight, but Ralsei's is X- whatever
[2:16:47] <%TheImmortal70> Why is it X?
[2:17:00] <@Calek> X for Cross
[2:17:01] <%yeeyeyee> that fluff is x-rated
[2:17:03] <%king_wragles> "we're friends now, let's have friendly violence together!"
[2:17:06] <%TombstoneTTromboners> because it's cool
[2:17:07] <@Calek> like combined
[2:17:10] <@Calek> like Chrono Trigger
[2:17:14] <%acousticdonuts> x for xtra-cute
[2:17:17] <%jiin6> TP monies delish
[2:17:19] <%TheImmortal70> Yeah I guess that could be it
[2:17:29] <%SleepyMaribo> Susie alone makes the combat niteresting
[2:17:31] <%TheImmortal70> With how things are in this... genre?
[2:17:35] <%TheImmortal70> Is this a genre now?
[2:17:38] <%Mornaka> 69
[2:17:41] <%Dakuu75> if you just un-equip susie's weapon do you still have to spend time warning ppl?
[2:17:50] <%king_wragles> those animations are friggin clean
[2:17:52] <%TheImmortal70> Anyways in this WHATEVER, every detail is important most of the time
[2:17:53] <%yeeyeyee> @Dakuu75 she still attacks
[2:17:55] <%QuadraticGravity> @Dakuu75 Can't unequip it
[2:17:58] <%jiin6> She Refuses
[2:18:13] <%Admiral_PopnFresh> Susie is a tad more psychotic than you Paige
[2:18:22] <%TheImmortal70> ROUXLS KAARD, YOU BASTARD
[2:18:24] <%Mornaka> rules knight?
[2:18:29] <%SleepyMaribo> Hey Pat if you deplete the hp of a enemy as Kris of Ralsie, you dont kill them, the enemy runs away, Only Susie can inflict a fatal blow.
[2:18:29] <%Mornaka> ah
[2:18:35] <%GarbageNirvana> Oh, I get it now
[2:18:54] <%TheImmortal70> That doesn't seem right at all
[2:18:59] <%yeeyeyee> susie stop negging so hard and often
[2:19:07] <%Dakuu75> @Admiral_PopnFresh dude, Susie seems mroe than "psycotic" she's repeditivly threatening multiple ppl to eat their face, then shoves her teeth into their personal space
[2:19:08] <%TheImmortal70> Because she can't hit them if you warn them
[2:19:15] <%QuadraticGravity> That sounds like bullshit
[2:19:18] <+SomeOtherNeb> me_irl
[2:19:30] <%TheImmortal70> Because even Ralsei can attack
[2:19:30] <%topendbuzz> jeez girl
[2:19:50] <%ToxInjection> on one hand: what ab edgelord
[2:19:58] <%Mornaka> green is not a primary color and neithert is purple
[2:20:07] <%ToxInjection> on the other hand: same
[2:20:17] <%TheImmortal70> Also anyone want to talk about how your colors became blue and red?
[2:20:22] <%TheImmortal70> You were green before
[2:20:28] <%iwishthiswasicq> Man, I hate when people put their teeth in my personal space.
[2:20:31] <%TombstoneTTromboners> now you're frisk colors
[2:20:33] <%QuadraticGravity> She forgot to spare again.
[2:20:45] <%bread_assassin> Did Paige already forget she could do this in one turn?
[2:20:50] <%jiin6> X Flatter
[2:20:59] <%Dakuu75> "let them have their fun"
[2:21:28] <%Mornaka> take your time
[2:21:39] <@mothmandraws> with bullet grazing
[2:21:42] <@mothmandraws> we just need bombs
[2:21:47] <%TheImmortal70> Bullet grazing is great
[2:21:48] <@mothmandraws> and 40x the bullet count
[2:21:51] <@mothmandraws> and we can be touhou
[2:22:02] <%TheImmortal70> @mothmandraws do you understand what you've done? THERE CAN BE A DODGE COMBO METER
[2:22:05] <%iwishthiswasicq> @PeachSaliva If you're sparing the last enemy and Ralsei has nothing to do, I'm pretty sure defending will give you more TP.
[2:22:06] <%QuadraticGravity> The save point was right ahead of you.
[2:22:07] <%Dakuu75> the sprites and animation all rdy make this better visually than undertale. regardless of everything else
[2:22:10] <%TheImmortal70> SMOKIN SICK STYLE DODGES
[2:22:12] <%jiin6> Delicious Delicious TP
[2:22:27] <%topendbuzz> yes 100 hours
[2:22:28] <%SaltyDongs> days
[2:22:37] <%yeeyeyee> ! LOST !
[2:22:43] <%TheImmortal70> Attacks and acts go in order, but defends at the end of battle go altogether
[2:22:47] <%UncannyMatt> 100 hours LUL
[2:22:47] <%acousticdonuts> ! DIRECTION AT RISK !
[2:22:51] <%iwishthiswasicq> I will dab now so I can make the money I paid worth it. apatDab

[2:24:10] <%TheImmortal70> Also even though Toby said not to talk about it for 24 hours, the fact so many people have dug around in this game and have posted guides to certain things is really helpful
[2:24:44] <%jiin6> sipsipDab apatDab
[2:24:46] <%acousticdonuts> i can't wait until people start talking about it for real, i bet i missed a ton of cool shit on my playthrough
[2:24:51] <%Dakuu75> lol, guides, r34, walkthroughs, fan fics, it ALL exists all rdy, i'm sure
[2:24:53] <%GuttyGoop> if you act with kris and spare with ralsei in the same turn you can knock em out one by one
[2:24:58] <%TheImmortal70> Oh definitely
[2:25:05] <%TheImmortal70> Someone already mentioned 20 posts of R34 at LEAST
[2:25:16] <%TheImmortal70> @guttyGoop They've been informed
[2:25:17] <%DrWolpertinger> gross
[2:25:19] <%jiin6> fans work fast...
[2:25:20] <%QuadraticGravity> unnatural
[2:25:21] <%yeeyeyee> @TheImmortal70 i think he knew people would talk about it, but wanted to dissuade people from being so open about what it actually is
[2:25:24] <@mothmandraws> here we go

[2:26:06] <%TheImmortal70> @yeeyeyee Of course all I had were some names, and boy does the image about what the game is make a whole lot of difference
[2:26:10] <%KaosMachina> fucking _amazing
[2:26:10] <%Hamtacular> Wow she bumbled through that and somehow made it

[3:52:53] <%x24sonic> SHE GETS GOOD
[3:52:55] <%MrBorisMakarov> rooCry
[3:52:57] <%acousticdonuts> IT'S ALMOST AS IF CHARACTERS CAN BE INTERESTING WITHOUT BEING NICE
[3:53:00] <%acousticdonuts> CRAZY IDEA
[3:53:01] <%Spydurman> also another example of a choice not mattering, weird
[3:53:03] <%The_Lady_Alustriel> asmoPepeHands
[3:53:04] <%king_wragles> While you're not wrong @Dakuu75 , you're also not wrong
[3:53:27] <%OffKilta> your choices are like points in whose line
[3:53:28] <%king_wragles> but I like how she (mostly) interacts with Lancer... cause he's the best.
[3:53:30] <%Dakuu75> man, what a slim and non-existant attempt at redemption here
[3:53:41] <%DrWolpertinger> but like she has to be a cunt in order for us to like her when she goes through her redemtion arc
[3:53:42] <%Spydurman> oh man I'm so hoping his dad is like a mega evil Sans
[3:53:42] <%x24sonic> she. redeems. herself.
[3:53:45] <%Jpdodds> This is a story about Susie. Your choices don't matter because YOU DONT MATTER
[3:53:47] <%QuadraticGravity> Paige wtf
[3:53:47] <%Jpdodds> NO
[3:53:50] <%Gustave_XIII> He's also ness

[3:53:50] <%RadRegice> lol
[3:53:51] <%QuadraticGravity> lmao
[3:53:52] <EASrake> No, Sans is Ness
[3:53:52] <coke_monster> NESS??
[3:53:52] <%SoarFlyer> ???
[3:53:56] <time_axis> DID SANS TURN INTO A TREE
[3:53:57] <megamonmon123> game theory
[3:53:57] <%Gustave_XIII> Not even
[3:53:58] <+Aftershock562> I don’t understand how people think this is somehow out of nowhere
[3:53:59] <%SuperPixelRush> he's not sans
[3:54:00] <@corn_on_fire> his teeth lmao
[3:54:04] <%king_wragles> DELTA RUNE IS SANS
[3:54:05] <%jiin6> the answer is no
[3:54:05] <%Dakuu75> LOL WHY?! Why the fuck does she keep assuming everyone is a famous undertale character XD
[3:54:06] <%ssjklyco> Is this Anor Londo?
[3:54:08] <@danzig2> let em theorize
[3:54:09] <%x24sonic> I WILL DEFEND SUSIE UNTIL THE DAY I DIE AND YALL WILL SEE LATER ON
[3:54:11] <%SuperPixelRush> SANS IS NESS
[3:54:12] <@mothmandraws> is he anor londo
[3:54:14] <%RadRegice> y'know who else has teeth? ness
[3:54:14] <%iwishthiswasicq> AND SUSIE IS TOTALLY PAPYRUS RIGHT?!?!?!
[3:54:15] <%MisterTylerrr> Sans MUST be his dad {I'm guessing. I haven't even played Undertale.{
[3:54:17] <%AbnormalVoid> Susie is NESS
[3:54:30] <%SoarFlyer> toothpaste man is flower
[3:54:36] <%DrWolpertinger> susie is mario
[3:54:36] <%The_Lady_Alustriel> x24sonic I like her already, she's good
[3:54:37] <%king_wragles> I mean, I like Susie (kinda) but she is factually a cunt.
[3:54:52] <%x24sonic> ok true
[3:55:02] <%yeeyeyee> @Dakuu75 yeah i wonder why she would think that when we've seena bunch of undertale characters and this all seems like a mushed up fever dream of undertale 1
[3:55:04] <%x24sonic> well i'm glad SOMEONE understands
[3:55:04] <%Spydurman> Kris and Ralsei secretly evil????
[3:55:10] <%acousticdonuts> i mean yeah, to start with

[3:56:08] <%jiin6> stupid people
[3:56:15] <%Spydurman> HOW CAN THIS GAME BE REAL IF OUR EYES ARENT REAL
[3:56:21] <%x24sonic> oH SHIT

[3:56:29] <%SaltyDongs> FLit Elevator
[3:56:31] <%jiin6> your eyes are going to prison
[3:56:32] <%king_wragles> this game is really just a dream the cold spaghetti had
[3:56:32] <%SoarFlyer> How can this game be free if our eyes are in prison
[3:56:38] <%GeneralSCPatton> This is very Wonderland-ish
[3:56:41] <%x24sonic> it is
[3:56:46] <%yeeyeyee> it super is
[3:56:49] <%Cobalt_Racer> what a thrill
[3:56:59] <%DrWolpertinger> what gave it away the cards, the suits, the checkers ans chess
[3:57:02] <%x24sonic> honestly i can't fucking believe this game is free bc it's a full 2-3 hours
[3:57:15] <%yeeyeyee> i said this before but this entire game is toby giving all of us shrooms and throwing us in a closet to fall into ourselves
[3:57:15] <%AbnormalVoid> just the demo
[3:57:16] <%jiin6> Susie caught the ACTing bug
[3:57:18] <%TheImmortal70> It's a QUALITY full 2-3 hours
[3:57:19] <%Spydurman> they've played Shitstorm games with less content
[3:57:27] <%x24sonic> @TheImmortal70 YE
[3:57:28] <%jiin6> this isn't a demo
[3:57:32] <@mothmandraws> I dont think "demo" is correct term
[3:57:34] <%DGenerator> !uptime
[3:57:36] <@mothmandraws> its chapter 1
[3:57:37] <%Dakuu75> @Spydurman true
[3:57:38] <%The_Lady_Alustriel> is this Frog Fractions 4?
[3:57:39] <%TheImmortal70> This is a chapter definitely
[3:57:41] <%x24sonic> agreed, demo isn't the right word
[3:57:45] <%acousticdonuts> this is the ground zeroes of undertale
[3:57:50] <%DrWolpertinger> @yeeyeyee is it because they get trapped in the closet?
[3:57:51] <%Spydurman> we do agree
[3:57:58] <%topendbuzz> wait there was a ff3?
[3:57:59] <%Dakuu75> SHUT UP!!!
[3:58:04] <%jiin6> this isn't undertale, more of a spinoff
[3:58:07] <%Dakuu75> jump off a CLIFF!!!
[3:58:13] <%acousticdonuts> jesus we get it
[3:58:13] <%Spydurman> ba-baka
[3:58:21] <%x24sonic> except as opposed to ground zeroes this game isn't extremely overpriced
[3:58:25] <%jiin6> for REALSIES
[3:58:25] <@mothmandraws> go ????
[3:58:27] <%Spydurman> DO IT
[3:58:28] <%Gustave_XIII> Wait, wat??

[4:27:57] <%AbnormalVoid> CHAOS CHAOOS
[4:27:59] <%acousticdonuts> I CAN DO ANYTHING
[4:28:08] <%SergeEXE> CHAOS LEGION
[4:28:14] <+Radoh> METAMORPHISIS
[4:28:25] <@mothmandraws> this is very close to a combo of 2-3 2hu songs
[4:28:26] <%QuadraticGravity> I have zero faith but am enjoying the attempt immensely.
[4:28:31] <+SomeOtherNeb> CHAOS VS FUCK SQUAD
[4:28:40] <%Aztec50> Does toby fox play Warhammer 40K?
[4:28:44] <%SuperPixelRush> oh my God they're gonna be streaming for another 2 hours aren't they
[4:28:54] <%SaltyDongs> -33
[4:28:55] <%TheImmortal70> Probably not
[4:28:56] <%QuadraticGravity> @SuperPixelRush Two if they stop after this attempt.
[4:29:03] <%TheImmortal70> Man seems like a 2hu / rpg player
[4:29:04] <%Dakuu75> NEGATIVE hp?! hp goes int eh negative here!? damn-son that's some hardcore-shit
[4:29:09] <%AbnormalVoid> SourPls so fucking good
[4:29:10] <@mothmandraws> I think 2-3 runs
[4:29:18] <%The_Lady_Alustriel> he's definitely a 2hu player
[4:29:19] <%TheImmortal70> It has to go negative because you can use normal healing items to revive
[4:29:21] <%SleepyMaribo> you can heal negative damage with regualr healing items
[4:29:23] <%jiin6> -33 dead
[4:29:31] <%TheImmortal70> So for instance the cake would revive
[4:29:35] <%TheImmortal70> So if you get REALLY fucked, you cake
[4:29:40] <%QuadraticGravity> Beating this boss earlier today made me fucking NUT
[4:29:40] <%TheImmortal70> And single falls, you use the mints
[4:29:56] <%TheImmortal70> It really isn't that bad, it took me like five attempts right at the beginning of the stream
[4:29:59] <@mothmandraws> I like this song, but its not same without random voice lines
[4:29:59] <%SuperPixelRush> they've still gotta beat the "final boss" and see the ending
[4:30:04] <%TheImmortal70> CHAOS CHAOS
[4:30:07] <%TheImmortal70> SourPls
[4:30:10] <%QuadraticGravity> DAMAGE IS HIGH, LADS
[4:30:13] <%SleepyMaribo> yeah tis fight is harder then sans
[4:30:17] <%Dakuu75> @QuadraticGravity it's one of those "takes a stupid amount of concentration to win" kinda things? like sans?
[4:30:19] <%jiin6> Fluffy is down
[4:30:20] <%acousticdonuts> JEVIL DON'T FUCK AROUND
[4:30:23] <%waddledoops> just pirouet
[4:30:24] <%TheImmortal70> That's the other clincher: You need EVERYONE up
[4:30:24] <%QuadraticGravity> @Dakuu75 Basically!
[4:30:30] <@mothmandraws> but ye id do 2-3 runs at most and go do actual stuff you can come back
[4:30:32] <%TheImmortal70> I love those conditions
[4:30:40] <%QuadraticGravity> Just do Pirouette
[4:30:41] <%Dakuu75> @QuadraticGravity good to know. at least I won't hold my breathe here then XD
[4:30:46] <%SleepyMaribo> saw someoen fight this guy and it took 2 hours, not because he kept dying, but because it takes forver to pacify Jevil
[4:30:48] <%TheImmortal70> Pirouette is worthless
[4:30:59] <%CaptainPileDriver> episode 1
[4:31:00] <%acousticdonuts> it really does
[4:31:00] <%DrWolpertinger> so can you act or do you have to beat his ass
[4:31:00] <%yeeyeyee> "this is a demo" h-haha
[4:31:04] <%TheImmortal70> It sometimes buffs him and uses 20 tp that could be used for guaranteed pacifist progress
[4:31:05] <%QuadraticGravity> It progresses the fight and has a chance at full heal
[4:31:06] <%jiin6> 1st ep...
[4:31:13] <%SergeEXE> man.....if episode 2 drops tomorrow....
[4:31:14] <%AbnormalVoid> METAMORPHOSIS
[4:31:15] <%TheImmortal70> @DrWolpertinger Both, and it changes the reward depending on the way you do it
[4:31:19] <%Aztec50> Is this the Binding of Isaac?
[4:31:22] <%SoarFlyer> go into where they intersect
[4:31:23] <%The_Lady_Alustriel> smells like chaos
[4:31:24] <%QuadraticGravity> No he's not.
[4:31:26] <%acousticdonuts> what do you get for killing him?
[4:31:26] <%SuperPixelRush> If episode 2 drops tomorrow I'm losing my shit
[4:31:32] <%SergeEXE> same
[4:31:34] <%Aztec50> its like all of my favorite games in one
[4:31:43] <%SuperPixelRush> I'm not even expecting episode 2 this year
[4:31:44] <%TheImmortal70> I don't believe episode 2 will come out
[4:31:54] <%SergeEXE> i dont either
[4:31:58] <%TheImmortal70> I think it'll be out before new years, but I think that he'll announce the full project
[4:31:59] <%DrWolpertinger> OMG I KNOW WHO HE IS. HES THAT CLOWN FROM ASHORES CASTLE WITH THE KNIGHT NITE
[4:32:00] <%QuadraticGravity> No, Pat, his name isn't blue.
[4:32:03] <@thenefftw> No, he's not
[4:32:05] <%The_Lady_Alustriel> what if toby pulls a Frog Fractions
[4:32:07] <%jiin6> ep 2 two years til never
[4:32:08] <%TheImmortal70> Nope
[4:32:15] <%TheImmortal70> Madjick is something completely different
[4:32:16] <%AbnormalVoid> he's just a Joker
[4:32:19] <%TheImmortal70> This is the JEVIL
[4:32:19] <%SuperPixelRush> episode 2 2019 most realistic
[4:32:19] <@thenefftw> @PeachSaliva Trust me, Jevil won't be tired for a while
[4:32:21] <%waddledoops> what if ep 2 is in the code of the game or some shit
[4:32:22] <%jiin6> Jester Evil
[4:32:26] <%Spydurman> Hypnosis and heal
[4:32:27] <%AbnormalVoid> everything here is Card Based
[4:32:28] <%QuadraticGravity> This is a dragout fucking brawl
[4:32:30] <%TheImmortal70> @peachsaliva Think Sans
[4:32:32] <%TheImmortal70> THIS ATTACK
[4:32:33] <%TheImmortal70> FUCK IT
[4:32:39] <%The_Lady_Alustriel> is this a gastor 🤔

[4:33:00] <%acousticdonuts> dude the bonus shopkeeper dialogue you get for fighting this guy is so intriguing
[4:33:11] <%Typhaeon> The spade ring attack is the absolute worst
[4:33:11] <%TheImmortal70> Fuck I forgot to check the shop keep dialogue
[4:33:12] <@mothmandraws> susie is best for full revive she can tank alot more
[4:33:12] <%SleepyMaribo> Pat they locked this guy up for a reason, ive yet to see someone beat thsiguy
[4:33:12] <%SuperPixelRush> really
[4:33:21] <%TheImmortal70> The spade ring attack is the third easiest
[4:33:21] <@thenefftw> I actually beat him
[4:33:26] <%Virtual_Rays> Use the other ACT
[4:33:28] <%Kazooki_Kazami> I CAN DO ANYTHING
[4:33:28] <@thenefftw> He's a piece of shit, but I did it
[4:33:29] <%Spydurman> how the fuck nef
[4:33:36] <%Virtual_Rays> Hypnosis cost too much and uses your other parties actions
[4:33:38] <@thenefftw> Got lucky on the second part
[4:33:38] <%OffKilta> ded
[4:33:38] <%acousticdonuts> yeah i managed somehow

[4:33:46] <%The_Lady_Alustriel> nef confirmed god amongst mortals
[4:33:47] <%CaptainPileDriver> this will take WAY to long
[4:33:49] <%acousticdonuts> took ALL of my healing items
[4:33:50] <%Djinnazz> just running into them at this point.
[4:33:52] <%QuadraticGravity> The fight actually stagnates on difficulty after Final Chaos

[4:36:38] <%acousticdonuts> PROTOCOL 3: PROTECT THE RALSEI

[4:38:21] <%DrWolpertinger> READ IT IN FRENCH PERDANT
[4:38:24] <%TheImmortal70> I think that's the POINT
[4:38:31] <%TheImmortal70> It's undertale but condensed
[4:38:33] <%QuadraticGravity> You've been playing for several hours, you HAVE beaten the entirety of undertale.
[4:38:36] <@mothmandraws> undertale light
[4:38:37] <%SuperPixelRush> yeah it feels like a condensed undertale
[4:39:05] <%SergeEXE> there MIGHT be something new tomorrow. it's a possibility.
[4:39:05] <%TheImmortal70> I finally put it together
[4:39:07] <%NWR_James> VERY purple
[4:39:10] <%TheImmortal70> I know why that voice is so fitting
[4:39:13] <%TheImmortal70> It's fucking Daryl
[4:39:14] <%jiin6> Sup
[4:39:19] <%TheImmortal70> Because Lancer is just fucking Daryl
[4:39:20] <%The_Lady_Alustriel> I HIGHLY doubt there will be something new
[4:39:23] <%Spydurman> murdered?
[4:39:23] <%TheImmortal70> From ok ko
[4:39:33] <%SuperPixelRush> well, we know there will be *something* tomorrow, but not Undertale related
[4:39:36] <%Spydurman> PogChamp
[4:39:39] <%SuperPixelRush> I'm referring to Smash
[4:39:39] <%NiktenKing> It's Pat's Irving voice
[4:39:45] <%The_Lady_Alustriel> so how many Fate jokes have people made tonight
[4:39:49] <%Aztec50> and so the circle of not nice fathers continues
[4:39:53] <%acousticdonuts> not enough
[4:40:00] <%AbnormalVoid> the way this is the third time this happens, the first two times set up by Susie, is so good
[4:40:05] <%AbnormalVoid> where he lifts him up
[4:40:14] <%The_Lady_Alustriel> yeah fair enough
[4:40:22] <%The_Lady_Alustriel> I haven't seen one in the like 40ish inutes I've been ehre

[4:41:04] <%The_Lady_Alustriel> Yeah I'm with Plague on this one
[4:41:05] <%AbnormalVoid> it's a very "first boss" bos design

[4:41:14] <%The_Lady_Alustriel> also SourPls
[4:41:16] <%QuadraticGravity> he looks weird and dorky and bad and i think that's intentional, it's pretty good

[4:41:51] <%Spydurman> Yeah I feel he looks stupid on purpose
[4:41:53] <%Shadowpint> I like his design.

[4:42:15] <@mothmandraws> I like his stomach
[4:42:19] <%jiin6> like a Whip
[4:42:23] <%AbnormalVoid> I fucking love how much this game plays with the old battle formula
[4:42:23] <%SuperPixelRush> I love it when he screws with the game like that

[4:43:58] <redginger666> check
[4:43:59] <%DrWolpertinger> Red Buster doesnt count as damage right?
[4:44:05] <%SergeEXE> it does
[4:44:09] <%TheImmortal70> It's explicitly damaage
[4:44:10] <%jiin6> use all the Red
[4:44:32] <%DrWolpertinger> oh shit
[4:44:33] <%jiin6> and then they don't move no more
[4:44:35] <%QuadraticGravity> Dual Heal is a party heal
[4:45:35] <%The_Lady_Alustriel> suds
[4:45:38] <%x24sonic> SUDS
[4:45:40] <%Dakuu75> oh gawd
[4:45:42] <%NiktenKing> UDS
[4:45:44] <%QuadraticGravity> EVERYTHING IS SANS
[4:45:46] <%Aztec50> he is kinda like a worse sans
[4:45:51] <%Shadowpint> its suds tundletar
[4:45:52] <%jiin6> not enough lasers and skuls
[4:45:53] <%SergeEXE> SUDS AND PAPILION
[4:45:53] <%AbnormalVoid> King is Sans Kappa
[4:45:53] <@mothmandraws> is sans sans?
[4:45:54] <%The_Lady_Alustriel> my favourite Undertale character Suds
[4:45:54] <%acousticdonuts> everything is sans
[4:45:59] <%acousticdonuts> except sans, he's papyrus
[4:46:00] <%Dakuu75> yeah, and because this guy is a king, and asgore is a king. they must be... BROTHERS!
[4:46:01] <%The_Lady_Alustriel> Is this a Sans
[4:46:16] <%SergeEXE> is this Anor Sans-do?
[4:46:17] <%Aztec50> well susie is a Sasuke so...
[4:46:20] <%NiktenKing> SUDS IS DESS
[4:46:24] <%Spydurman> Internet looking at skeletons "Is this a Sans?"
[4:46:32] <Chaoko99> SUDS UNDERTALE
[4:46:32] <%jiin6> tfsSubmit
[4:46:48] <%Dakuu75> @Aztec50 how is she a sasuke?
[4:46:57] <%SoarFlyer> petition to rename "skeletons" to "sanses"
[4:47:06] <%yeeyeyee> every person who starts as a jerk and later becomes less of a jerk is sasuke
[4:47:10] <%yeeyeyee> naruto invented character arcs
[4:47:17] <%Spydurman> Susie isn't Sasuke she's Paige
[4:47:25] <@mothmandraws> does no damage
[4:47:25] <%Aztec50> Is generally dark, need to go on a rescue arc, has a weird eye thing
[4:47:36] <%Dakuu75> I've yet to see susie become any less of a jerk
[4:47:45] <%Itselguapo> This game made me want to play Blue omen operation
[4:47:46] <%acousticdonuts> you haven't been looking
[4:48:09] <%yeeyeyee> susie is a good person
[4:48:11] <%The_Lady_Alustriel> I feel like chat turned on Susie super early and refuses to listen
[4:48:19] <%acousticdonuts> yeah that's pretty much what happened
[4:48:20] <%iwishthiswasicq> It's not chat, it's one guy.
[4:48:23] <%QuadraticGravity> Nah it's just that one guy Alus
[4:48:32] <%x24sonic> just the one guy
[4:48:32] <%The_Lady_Alustriel> I thouught I saw at least 2
[4:48:33] <%SoarFlyer> Susue killed my parents
[4:48:34] <%Aztec50> Susie is the best character though, so thats a point in the other direction
[4:48:39] <%x24sonic> susie is good
[4:48:43] <%marsano168> Susie is great
[4:48:48] <%iwishthiswasicq> Nah man, I do not like this person therefore writing is bad.
[4:48:48] <%Dakuu75> I guess i'm still on about how her first interaction and others was "I'm gonna eat your face" then shoved her teeth into ppl's faces
[4:49:01] <%Spydurman> @The_Lady_Alustriel to be fair our introduction to Susie was her trying to literally eat our face off
[4:49:01] <@mothmandraws> tbf dakuu
[4:49:03] <%acousticdonuts> yes, and a lot's happened since then
[4:49:06] <%waddledoops> the whole story of the pacifist run of the game is to show her character growth how have you not seen her change?\
[4:49:07] <%QuadraticGravity> Dont waste the cake.
[4:49:08] <@mothmandraws> thats how I normaly talk to ppl
[4:49:09] <@PlagueOfGripes> Susie's arc is going from raging cunt to 'normal asshole'
[4:49:20] <%jiin6> Susie Ate all the ham, then went to McDonalds and ate all the hashbrowns
[4:49:32] <%SoarFlyer> @PlagueOfGripes Your gripes aren't supposed to be CORRECT
[4:49:32] <%Aztec50> maybe even lovable ragamuffin
[4:49:33] <@thenefftw> At the start of the game, I hated her with every fiber of my being, but after playing through the story, I think she's pretty good
[4:49:36] <%The_Lady_Alustriel> Spydurman I guess but I wouldn't write her off
[4:49:40] <%iwishthiswasicq> @PlagueOfGripes More growth than anyone else in this game.
[4:49:40] <awsomesaucekirby> cheer232 susie is what if the little girl dog from FMA grew up
[4:49:47] <%Dakuu75> @PlagueOfGripes basically
[4:49:54] <%QuadraticGravity> God he looks so purposefully awful it's great
[4:49:58] <%Itselguapo> wait when Ralsei used a item did he lift his hat and use an item?
[4:50:05] <%AbnormalVoid> he reminds me of Pete lol
[4:50:28] <%jiin6> @PlagueOfGripes well what do you expect from an Isekai?
[4:50:33] <%Spydurman> she's gonna fucking murder him . . .
[4:50:53] <%TheImmortal70> Flowey: YOU FUCKING WHAT

[4:51:22] <%acousticdonuts> it's a swordshield
[4:51:26] <%Itselguapo> he always had the shield.....
[4:51:29] <EASrake> Kris has had the shield the entire time
[4:51:29] <%Aztec50> that shield shows up whenever they block
[4:51:30] <%acousticdonuts> or a shieldsword, depending on which hemisphere you're from
[4:51:32] <%Itselguapo> use used it when he defends....
[4:51:35] <%Virtual_Rays> @TheImmortal70 He uses shields during blocking though
[4:51:35] <%OffKilta> this game is going to be all about how it's impossible to go true pacifist
[4:51:44] <%TheImmortal70> Does he? Huh I guess I never noticed
[4:51:45] <%jiin6> HIS MUTE
[4:51:55] <%NiktenKing> EYES

[4:52:56] <%AbnormalVoid> LUL
[4:53:04] <@mothmandraws> dad is a rank in life

[4:53:13] <%QuadraticGravity> "Im the dad" gave me trouble breathing for a minute
[4:53:15] <%TheImmortal70> And it's a line that's already been used in ok ko, so that just adds to the fact he's JUST Daryl.
[4:53:17] <@mothmandraws> its like prestige in call of duty
[4:53:26] <%Virtual_Rays> Do NOT progress. Go back and talk to everyone.

[5:01:14] <%AbnormalVoid> I noticed that too
[5:01:16] <%AbnormalVoid> it's fucking weird
[5:01:20] <%NiktenKing> It changes throughout the game
[5:01:23] <%DGenerator> The game started out as "The Beginning," too.
[5:01:30] <%AbnormalVoid> dog noise
[5:01:31] <%SlugNut> I didn't notice that and I doubt chat is in on a goof so that sounds awesome.
[5:01:31] <%acousticdonuts> when you die, it becomes "the death"
[5:01:32] <%TheImmortal70> I'm assuming the dark is wherever the fuck gaster and "you" are

[5:11:08] <%duneblythe> video games are not real
[5:11:18] <@PlagueOfGripes> either it's a universe retelling or the plot is going to get really convoluted

[5:11:50] <%SuperPixelRush> @PlagueOfGripes I vote latter
[5:12:01] <%TheImmortal70> From what I can tell this is like if Chara just chose NOT to murder everyone and set them free way WAY earlier than Frisk
[5:12:02] <%QuadraticGravity> definitely the latter
[5:12:03] <%SuichiTanaka> Ahahahaha
[5:12:05] <%AbnormalVoid> it's so true LUL
[5:12:12] <@Donutjulio> This has to be an AU, with Asriel being alive, Asgore and Toriel being together, and Undyne and Alypys not being together
[5:12:13] <@PlagueOfGripes> wonder if this will be even remotely comprehensible to someone that never played 1
[5:12:14] <%jiin6> @PlagueOfGripes asset flip

[5:14:28] <%QuadraticGravity> I seriously hope that there's just as much of THIS as there is of DARK WORLD
[5:14:37] <%TheImmortal70> Yeah it's almost like they are a certain weird asshole
[5:14:45] <%QuadraticGravity> FAMILY Family family...
[5:14:56] <%NiktenKing> OOF

[5:17:07] <%TheImmortal70> I just connected more dots
[5:17:22] <%SuperPixelRush> Steel Ball Determination
[5:17:24] <%TheImmortal70> The entire town OTHER than Kris is monsters; after all, Chara never liked humans
[5:17:31] <%DrWolpertinger> lokkie first shopkeeper
[5:17:37] <%TheImmortal70> So this is the only way they even REMOTELY get a normal upbringing
[5:18:05] <%jiin6> DRINK the ice
[5:18:17] <%Spydurman> Also I wanna say holy shit Toby released what could almost be considered a super short game for free just to get ideas of where to go with it

[5:54:26] <+OceanGovernor> NEVER MORE WRONG
[5:54:26] <%NiktenKing> "I gotta make this big"

[5:54:30] <gslayer14> SANS DELTARUNE FOR SMASH
[5:54:30] <%SoarFlyer> Pat is Undertale
[5:54:30] <twohitgood> that's only because you have a tainted undertale game
[5:54:31] <+Seheti> A few options there and Pat chose the least right one
[5:54:31] <+mugwugsampoo> INFINITE SUKOYOMI
[5:54:31] <Belutima> @PeachSaliva sounds like a, Pacifict run, AFTER a Genocide run.
[5:54:31] <+AXL808> PAT IS SUPER WRONG- RIGHT
[5:54:31] <%Virtual_Rays> This isn't a demo though
[5:54:33] <%QuadraticGravity> I NEED TO KNOW.

[5:54:42] <+waterbuddy16> this is prequel, where the actual chara with a real persons name was still alive

[5:56:07] <+TaifuDragon> The Deltarune website has been up since Undertale launched on the wayback machine, it's all a work @PeachSaliva
[5:56:07] <DedlokPM> I completely understand. really helps deter spoils. mogsSmile
[5:56:08] <Meme_Platinum> no
[5:56:09] <EatTheB0otyLikeGroceries> My favorite dungeoon/catacombs stream!
[5:56:09] <DonatelloJose> i'm glad no one was spoiled. thank you mods
[5:56:09] <@Donutjulio> The song is called dont forget, which is also in a note you find in sans' shed, so it may be a weird prequel
[5:56:10] <MagicHatss> The music was LIT
[5:56:10] <%theo_marks> m o r t i s
[5:56:11] <twohitgood> i agree with the mods choice...even if it was a little frustrating at times but totally get it for the spoiler protection.
[5:56:11] <Calamity2007> We don't know in the end
[5:56:12] <Meme_Platinum> it's an AU
[5:56:13] <DrakeSilvos> I have no idea.
[5:56:13] <+doc_coyote> If Prime gave me more than one, it's currently going to my sister, I'd definitely give you both a sub.
[5:56:14] <count_bob> @PeachSaliva You can move your soul around the cage.

[5:56:18] <%theo_marks> big AU
[5:56:18] <thebeargoesHONK> I thought this was going to a "D&D themed" story with Chara, Asriel, and Frisk
[5:56:19] <+RushUnplugged> nobody knows, it's CHAPTER ONE
[5:56:19] <+clockcase> will yall play the next chapter if it comes out tomorrow?
[5:56:21] <DevotedlyDragonesque> We do not have enough information.
[5:56:21] <blackwolf4567> it was not!
[5:56:22] <+shawntk_> SANS IS SMASH
[5:56:22] <+chaosbuckle> Theres no real answers right now but its fun to speculate
[5:56:22] <$Tredecian> feels like a sandbox hes gonna kick over
[5:56:23] <%theo_marks> Big AU
[5:56:23] <Crankthulhu> @PeachSaliva The website for this game was set up back in 2015. TOBY HAS BEEN PLANNING THIS
[5:56:23] <Estuko> what a mysterious Jogo
[5:56:24] <OkamiDude15> sick
[5:56:25] <%NiktenKing> TOBY IS DOG
[5:56:26] <WanderingScholar> !uptime
[5:56:27] <Donchalant402> @PeachSaliva Dont forget the possibility of it being a completely unrelated AU
[5:56:28] <Hawkbone_> What a fucking bizarre way to release the first episode of your game
[5:56:29] <%TheImmortal70> @peachsaliva It's an alternate universe where monsters didn't get sealed undergroud, as Asriel, Asgore, and Toriel all went to college and monsters seem to be quite normalized
[5:56:31] <$ooblagis> SANS IS FROM THIS WORLD ORIGINALLY, HE HAS A PHTO OF YOUR PARTY AND THE BLUEPRINTS TO YOUR STUPID DUCK TANK
[5:56:32] <%Townspoon> 8-4 play, the people that translate the monster hunter games for nintendo are a part of this.... so it has to be nintendo related
[5:56:32] <$mister___doctor> PLAY DERTROIT
[5:56:33] <grayjammer> We dont have enough information to quite know what Deltarune is all about.
[5:56:35] <OwlLightningMage> We don't have enough information
[5:56:35] <Drdarktouch> chara wanted some pie.
[5:56:35] <Scharfster> Apparently there's a gaster fight or something secret like that
[5:56:36] <%SlugNut> It's like getting half-way through Diamond is Unbreakable and then Kira shows up
[5:56:36] <+Mike190Twitch> Toby is Dog, Toby is God
[5:56:36] <knomad2b> iv'e never been so in on a thing
[5:56:38] <CaptainKarite> You are the soul, not Chara, it seems like Chara has rejected you.
[5:56:38] <%Spydurman> I think I get it. A shit ton of people did Pacifist and Genocide so our main character is Frisk and Chara but since doing Genocide "negates" Pacifism Chara's in charge
[5:56:40] <Meme_Platinum> apatWink apatWink apatWink
[5:56:42] <+mimikyu92> there is simply *no way* the darkners aren't real. I adamantly refuse that
[5:56:42] <twohitgood> i gotta think you only got the chara ending because you did bad ending in undertale.
[5:56:43] <Belutima> @PeachSaliva looks like a Pacifist run, AFTER a genocide run.
[5:56:44] <gdemondays> Can't wait for 6 more Game Theory vids
[5:56:45] <%Keyd00d> well yeah it takes time to make a game
[5:56:48] <ekkieekk> @PeachSaliva the theme outside the hidden boss room is gasters theme slowed down
[5:56:50] <%Itselguapo> I'm going the fuck to sleep though, it's 4am and i need to wake up at 10 for the smash bros thing
[5:56:54] <%yeeyeyee> @PeachSaliva did you like the game
[5:56:57] <OkamiDude15> woopsMB toby was actually masahiro sakurai THE WHOLE TIME woopsMB
[5:56:59] <%ssjklyco> He's been planning a Smash reveal for 3 years? That's dedication
[5:57:02] <cizal11> @twohitgood no that happens regardless of your UT progress
[5:57:06] <+waterbuddy16> deltarune is an anagram for undertale too
[5:57:10] <reonome> @twohitgood nah it happens no matter what
[5:57:12] <Estel013> ❤
[5:57:15] <Slade_XZ7> REGARDLESS of the Nintendo Direct, WE NEED TO check the website/game tomorrow, cuz that’s so much foreshadowing
[5:57:18] <%The_Lady_Alustriel> Paige how can you read anything in chat lol
[5:57:19] <pwnjones> ELMO IS KING
[5:57:23] <%The_Lady_Alustriel> it's all paragraphs and caps
[5:57:23] <Prevot> I ain't gonna sleep now, it's like 5 hour till the direct
[5:57:25] <Scharfster> I really think he is
[5:57:27] <Niney_Who> I'd prefer UNDYNE for Smash to be honest, just for Suplexes
[5:57:27] <captainthunderwolf> @waterbuddy16 It's a pretty good anagram, too.
[5:57:30] <%Shadowpint> I stayed up the whole time against my better judgement
[5:57:30] <Niney_Who> But it's probably gonna be Sans
[5:57:30] <+doc_coyote> It's only 1 here so this is around when I start getting ready for bed anyway. So I'm here for the long haul
[5:57:33] <Hawkbone_> He's probably an assist trophy, which I think is great
[5:57:34] <MagicHatss> Has nobody pointed out that this Susie might be an alter of the Suzy that's mentioned in undertale but never shows up?
[5:57:36] <$Agami23> shovel knight didnt even get in
[5:57:36] <+Mike190Twitch> But Snake
[5:57:36] <%Keyd00d> the game is on switch
[5:57:36] <ekkieekk> You missed a few really good moments with fluffy boy but youll probably see it later
[5:57:38] <CaptainKarite> But they released undertale on switch
[5:57:39] <captainthunderwolf> And then Bayonetta says...
[5:57:40] <%TheImmortal70> Well he's here
[5:57:41] <Bonobonobone> sans is already in smash
[5:57:42] <@mothmandraws> ye but undertale got switch port
[5:57:42] <gdemondays> If Sans is in the game Papyrus could be an echo fighter
[5:57:42] <Prevot> it will be an assist trophy from undertale
[5:57:44] <Crankthulhu> @PeachSaliva There was a an update to Undertale in 2016 that added a photo of 3 characters in Sans's lab. It said "dont forget" which is also the ending theme of Deltarune
[5:57:44] <twohitgood> sans said play with papyrus tomorrow.
[5:57:49] <%Itselguapo> Sans undertale is the new assist trophy.
[5:57:49] <+hatesdps> also paige was seriously mean tonight
[5:57:50] <GoldenSJ> Gottem
[5:57:50] <%The_Lady_Alustriel> Niney_Who my man
[5:57:51] <HannibalBeerus> Yeah fucking right Sans will be in Smash
[5:57:52] <+deity_majora> Really depends on how popular they are in Japan @PeachSaliva
[5:57:53] <Calamity2007> @waterbuddy16 In addition Kris is a partial anagram for Frisk
[5:57:55] <CaptainKarite> hit enter as you said it >.<
[5:57:57] <Fujiwara_92> I'm from the future to say it was piranha plant
[5:57:58] <+Meekest> @PeachSaliva Did you notice that Alphys is into superhero stuff and not anime
[5:58:00] <%NiktenKing> Actually my uncle is Rick
[5:58:00] <HannibalBeerus> Shovel Knight isnt even in Smash
[5:58:03] <fairore> god no
[5:58:08] <HannibalBeerus> he got lucky as an assist
[5:58:08] <%linSP> undertale is fuckhuge in japan too right

[5:59:15] <%jiin6> Toby did music for homestuck
[5:59:17] <Crankthulhu> @PeachSaliva There was also a new NPC in 2016 update, where she tells you to visit her neighbor's kid "Suzy" in another town. I am dead serious.
[5:59:18] <Niney_Who> THAT'S TOO FUCKING EARLY
[5:59:20] <OkamiDude15> woopsMB charlie can i talk about the mail ive been dying to talk about the mail woopsHyper

[5:59:39] <$nitronLVIII> I dont want Sans in smash but Papyrus would be great
[5:59:39] <reonome> @thea1ternative sounds like you missed the reveal where his face was literally asriel
[5:59:40] <%yeeyeyee> BLIND
[5:59:40] <%TheImmortal70> @TheA1ternative Not just an anagram, they are STRAIGHT UP Asriel, while "Asriel" is apparently at college, implying that there is someone completely different filling the role of asriel in this universe
[5:59:41] <bsmusic> rip
[5:59:41] <+Meekest> Blind
[5:59:42] <%AbnormalVoid> NO
[5:59:43] <cizal11> can't see shitttttttt
[5:59:43] <Logan_Jennings1> Just wanted to say, Kris is a type of Dagger, which is a good giveaway for Chara
[5:59:47] <+clockcase> can see
[5:59:47] <Graxe_> Liam's gonna be streaming it, though.
[5:59:48] <zamzoph> FUG, I missed it
[5:59:48] <@mothmandraws> I think it might be more "handful of indies" for smash
[5:59:50] <Niney_Who> @nitronLVIII But what about Undyne and Suplexes
[5:59:51] <cizal11> ok it's on screen now
[5:59:52] <vike_me> Its good now.
[5:59:58] <+Grithalmur> Is good
[5:59:59] <TheA1ternative> WE SEE IT
[6:00:03] <$Sphincter_Spelunker> Hollow Knight for Smash
[6:00:06] <Crankthulhu> @PeachSaliva Talking to new NPC unlocks the photo in Sans's lab. Also, the flames underneath the door in Sans house looks like the teleporter doors in Deltarune
[6:00:06] <+chaosbuckle> Oh man, people would rage if Sans got in but Shovel Knight didn't. Undertale has my sword in that fight tho
[6:00:11] <%yeeyeyee> OH HOLY FUCK
[6:00:11] <%Keyd00d> nice
[6:00:16] <ataxia72> THAT'S SICK

[6:00:49] <%AbnormalVoid> Fight JEVIL!
[6:00:50] <+SagatAteMyCornFlakes> That theme was beautiful
[6:00:50] <Crankthulhu> @PeachSaliva Clam Girl is the new NPC I mentioned
[6:00:50] <knomad2b> SHOOK
[6:00:52] <reonome> people are just giving you websites dont bother
[6:00:54] <%Itselguapo> that theme in the menu, is the ps4 theme for when you purchase undertale
[6:00:56] <+Grithalmur> That can wait
[6:00:59] <Niney_Who> I couldn't beat the Jevil either don't feel bad
[6:01:01] <CaptainKarite> I'd like to see the side boss beat, I got my ass wrecked by him
[6:01:02] <DrakeSilvos> I haven't beaten it yet either.
[6:01:04] <cizal11> make pat do it
[6:01:05] <%TheImmortal70> @peachsaliva I don't think I can handle back to back updates of this shit
[6:01:09] <%AbnormalVoid> Pat fight Jevil, yeyeye
[6:01:11] <$Sphincter_Spelunker> It is tomorrow
[6:01:11] <+Grithalmur> Have a great night!
[6:01:12] <subjectg> Jevil isn’t so bad
[6:01:12] <OkamiDude15> cant wait for jevil woopsKek
[6:01:18] <$ooblagis> If you can beat Sans, you can steamroll Jevil
[6:01:19] <Donchalant402> @PeachSaliva link isnt showing up in stream chat ill tweet it to you
[6:01:19] <+Shinsasu> hes pretty easy, did it 3rd try. stock up on big heals
[6:01:21] <%SiameseSneeze> @PeachSaliva will you be continuing Detroit Become Human?
[6:01:21] <zamzoph> I beat him on my second try Kappa
[6:01:22] <Slade_XZ7> @peachsaliva during the “hijack” of undertale twitter, there were 6 black bars as the name. Which obviously points to Gaster. Also in both Delta Rune and Undertale, typing Gaster as your name crashes the game. If I had to wager a guess, Gaster’s the one pulling the strings of the entire game series.
[6:01:23] <Niney_Who> I fucking Melt after playing it too much and can't remember how to survive certain patterns
[6:01:24] <%Keyd00d> what if the rest of the game comes out tomorrow
[6:01:27] <Viridiant> Jevil isn't that hard. I'm not a high skill player and I beat him on my second try
[6:01:32] <BigNerdSam> If you wake up tomorrow and Papyrus Undertale is in smash, how hard would you shit?
[6:01:32] <$Sphincter_Spelunker> No Mettaton either
[6:01:33] <%SleepyMaribo> Pap is getting ready for Smash
[6:01:33] <OkamiDude15> @zamzoph same woopsNom
[6:01:34] <%The_Lady_Alustriel> Metatron got snubbed too!
[6:01:37] <@mothmandraws> chapter 2
[6:01:37] <+RushUnplugged> PAPYRUS IS TRAINING FOR SMASH
[6:01:37] <%theo_marks> BITE YE TONGUE
[6:01:37] <knomad2b> dude if this game gets constant updates i think i'll explode
[6:01:38] <nyghtmare42> delta rune is an anagram for undertale, neat
[6:01:38] <%Itselguapo> Paige you should try pizza tower soon too that game had a demo last night.
[6:01:38] <$ooblagis> Save the best to entice people
[6:01:40] <Viridiant> Way easier than Sans
[6:01:41] <CaptainKarite> SAME
[6:01:42] <Stright_S> WHATS WRONG WITH BURGERPANTS HUH?
[6:01:42] <@PlagueOfGripes> they didn't show Muffet.
[6:01:43] <+nanitchi> @PeachSaliva tumblr link doesnt work
[6:01:43] <bsmusic> LUL
[6:01:44] <HannibalBeerus> CAUSE YOU KILLED PAP
[6:01:44] <@mothmandraws> is probably gonna be about him
[6:01:45] <shadowgilgamesh> burgerpants is the most important
[6:01:47] <Crankthulhu> @PeachSaliva You get one of two items for beating Jevil and vague dialogue with stuffed doll vendor, but nothing else, he's just a Super Boss
[6:01:48] <%AbnormalVoid> Don't shit your pants like Pat
[6:01:48] <%theo_marks> no he didnt!
[6:01:49] <cizal11> @PeachSaliva papyrus is tomorrow, along with the onion san thing
[6:01:50] <+TehBeerBaron> it's not a demo
[6:01:53] <+chaosbuckle> Technically you talked to him tho
[6:01:53] <cj_art> papyrus probably plays an important part in this game :0
[6:01:53] <$NaotoKozuki> No napstablook
[6:01:55] <cizal11> whatever tomorrow means
[6:01:55] <%TheImmortal70> @Plagueofgripes She was a back thing though
[6:01:58] <+deity_majora> I think Megaton is a grave stone
[6:01:59] <+TehBeerBaron> it's chapter 1
[6:02:00] <retro_pk> Jevil is a bully and I hate him
[6:02:02] <%theo_marks> mettaton is in Napstablooks house!
[6:02:02] <MagicHatss> I feel like the snubbed characters will show up in later chapters
[6:02:05] <%SergeEXE> Spider puss
[6:02:06] <OkamiDude15> @PeachSaliva when are you gonna actually fight muffet and not cheese her?
[6:02:07] <$ooblagis> Onion said come back tomorrow
[6:02:09] <+Grithalmur> If c2 comes tomorrow thats nuts
[6:02:09] <%TheImmortal70> @Plagueofgripes Backer*
[6:02:10] <Donchalant402> @PeachSaliva Just sent you a tweet with the link I was trying to post, this is very relevant to suzie
[6:02:10] <%Keyd00d> they both mentioned tomorrow
[6:02:11] <+Mike190Twitch> But that's just a theory...a GAME THEORY
[6:02:11] <%QuadraticGravity> @PeachSaliva Okay the Waterfall NPCs page on the official wiki has interesting shit
[6:02:11] <+mimikyu92> muffet will not return, she was a backer guest character
[6:02:14] <Stright_S> onion san said hed show you something
[6:02:14] <%SlugNut> There was a graveyard
[6:02:14] <CaptainKarite> Shyra?
[6:02:16] <$Agami23> i wonder if muffet CAN show up? since its a fan character
[6:02:16] <+Shinsasu> muffet was a kickstarter guest, so she doesnt count
[6:02:17] <Stright_S> tomorow
[6:02:18] <%Keyd00d> a ghost in the machine
[6:02:18] <%AbnormalVoid> Metaton isn't a gravestone?
[6:02:19] <%SaltyDongs> the mic
[6:02:20] <%Itselguapo> yea your right about that
[6:02:21] <MagicHatss> Tomorrow seems like an important date
[6:02:22] <try_it_sis_> oof
[6:02:22] <+Meekest> @PeachSaliva Some things are the exact opposite to the original Undertale: Mettaton is a "nobody," Alphys is into superhero comics and American cartoons
[6:02:23] <%SuichiTanaka> Onion said they had something to tell you later
[6:02:23] <zingdev> the game might just be episodic.
[6:02:25] <$ooblagis> He has no gravestone, it's the turtle shopkeep and the almalgoms
[6:02:26] <zamzoph> that sounded like Metaton in the ghost house
[6:02:30] <Logan_Jennings1> Kris is a type of dagger, so I think Pat was super right about this being a Post-Genocide
[6:02:32] <cizal11> @PeachSaliva paige onion told you directly to come back tomorrow, just like sans did.
[6:02:33] <%Keyd00d> that was shyra...
[6:02:33] <twohitgood> napstablook, metaton, papyrus, spiderdance....kinda bummed shyren was a gravestone. :(
[6:02:33] <%ssjklyco> Paige killed him so hard in the Genocide run that hey lost the asset for him in Deltarune
[6:02:36] <DLN002> Are they still ghosts in this weird AU? You can never say for sure till we see them
[6:02:37] <%yeeyeyee> THAT WAS SHYRA @PeachSaliva
[6:02:37] <$ooblagis> That was Shyreen's sister
[6:02:38] <arfsm95> @PeachSaliva I'm going to sleep now. I don't read feedback anymore so all I did today was eat pancakes. Tomorrow I will answer some questions. that's his tweet
[6:02:39] <%Itselguapo> there were no doggos either
[6:02:39] <reonome> that was shyren
[6:02:39] <+babrukus> the turtle merchant from undertale 1 is gerson, so he's dead for sure
[6:02:40] <$Tredecian> METATON HAS NOBODY/ IS A NOBODY
[6:02:40] <dragon_babe> no that was shyrens sister
[6:02:40] <Stright_S> no that grave was for shyren
[6:02:40] <grayjammer> Microphone was Shyren's sister
[6:02:41] <+nanitchi> yeah napstablook?
[6:02:41] <%theo_marks> the gravestones were all the Amalgamations
[6:02:42] <Stright_S> you dools
[6:02:43] <%The_Lady_Alustriel> lol sorry I messed you up with "Metatron" thats just how I call them. I knew you would know
[6:02:44] <Futurecity10> 4am theory building
[6:02:46] <%linSP> muffet, glade, and so sorry are all guest oc's so they dont have to be in the sequel?
[6:02:47] <reonome> chat dont be dumb
[6:02:48] <%yeeyeyee> THOSE GRAVESTONES ARE FOR THE AMALGAMS @PeachSaliva
[6:02:49] <Stright_S> fools*
[6:02:49] <+Grithalmur> He was house sitting for Napstablook
[6:02:50] <%TheImmortal70> Also I think it's pretty established that gaster and "us" are doing something to fuck with the timelines
[6:02:52] <%SergeEXE> SLEEP
[6:02:52] <Hawkbone_> @PeachSaliva The gravestones were the 3 abominations in Alphy's True Lab, and one is the turtle shopkeep
[6:02:52] <%Aztec50> oh woooooooow
[6:02:55] <OkamiDude15> woopsMB THE DUMMY FINGER woopsMB
[6:02:58] <@mothmandraws> @AngriestPat are you ready, part 2 comes out tommorow, part 3 never comes, its the new halflife 3
[6:02:58] <captainthunderwolf> @Logan_Jennings1 It's also one "F" short of an anagram for Frisk. Good eye, dude.
[6:03:02] <Them00n> Remember Paige, you have to accept everything that will happen from now on.
[6:03:02] <+Mike190Twitch> Toby Fox why you do this to us
[6:03:07] <knomad2b> yeah the theme of choices not mattering is freaking me out
[6:03:07] <Crankthulhu> @PeachSaliva Also, the game sends some of your data from the game over the Internet somehwere. We don't know what for but PC guys have looked at it and confirmed
[6:03:09] <+Mike190Twitch> FUcking Toby, why is he such a swell guy?!
[6:03:18] <bsmusic> D:
[6:03:18] <+chaosbuckle> How about that ending song? Beautiful
[6:03:22] <$ooblagis> Kris
[6:03:23] <%TheImmortal70> Kris
[6:03:24] <Divryne> KRIS.
[6:03:24] <grayjammer> Kris
[6:03:24] <arfsm95> @PeachSaliva also, be carefull, this is also on toby's twitter Hey apparently the uninstaller for DELTARUNE just deletes the entire directory the uninstaller is in. Depending on where you installed it, this could have some consequences. I recommend you don't use the uninstaller.
[6:03:25] <captainthunderwolf> Kris
[6:03:25] <OkamiDude15> Kris
[6:03:26] <%Aztec50> apparently the delta rune is the crest of the Dreemurr family, like Toriel
[6:03:28] <awsomesaucekirby> cheer232 I just realized something important, but by the time i bought the bits, i forgot
[6:03:28] <%linSP> KRIS - FRISK
[6:03:30] <MagicHatss> Kris Frisk
[6:03:33] <%theo_marks> PRESS F FOR KRIS
[6:03:34] <+deity_majora> Kris was wearing Chara colors from the beginning
[6:03:36] <DLN002> There's also Suzy and Susie
[6:03:36] <Divryne> KRIS FUCK.

[6:03:43] <cizal11> kris fuck squad
[6:03:45] <Prevot> The missing F is in Fuck Squad LUL
[6:03:46] <%SiameseSneeze> @PeachSaliva the Undertale twitter said the game is "Far from being done"
[6:03:46] <Crankthulhu> KRIS IS KUM SPELLED BACKWARDS
[6:03:50] <ekkieekk> Chara+Frisk= Kris @PeachSaliva
[6:03:51] <Stright_S> delete the uninstaller
[6:03:52] <+deity_majora> It deletes the folder it is in @PeachSaliva
[6:03:53] <%Keyd00d> toby willd elete your computer
[6:03:54] <%TheImmortal70> You have NO reason to use the uninstaller
[6:03:54] <%Itselguapo> I imagine this deltarune chapter 1 and chapter 2 is a teaser of the full game
[6:03:55] <%Spydurman> Chara murdered the F is Kris
[6:03:55] <DracaenaLeaf> I thought Kris was a combo between Chara and Frisk
[6:03:55] <+chaosbuckle> FUCK SQUAD!
[6:03:57] <zamzoph> that installation ToS is no joke LUL
[6:03:58] <+BioHunter> @PeachSaliva i found a vid that u might be interested in

[6:03:59] <MagicHatss> Hey if you wanna uninstall, you gotta do it manually w/o the uninstaller
[6:04:00] <Donchalant402> Missing an F because CHARA TOOK YOUR FREEDOM, AT THE BEGINING OF DELTA RUNE YOU'RE TOLD YOUR CHOICES DONT MATTER @PeachSaliva
[6:04:01] <+Meekest> What happens if you put Kris into the Undertale 1 name thing?
[6:04:01] <+chaosbuckle> HOORAH

[6:05:58] <%QuadraticGravity> goodnight chat
[6:06:02] <bsmusic> D:
[6:06:13] <%TheImmortal70> @silverira See I can see that too since it's clear you got two personalities. It's either that, or the Asriel in this timeline is Frisk
[6:06:13] <%theo_marks> can't wait for the deltarune planet in Kingdom hearts 3 now
[6:06:18] <grayjammer> oof
[6:06:22] <DLN002> KRIS IN THE DARK WORLD HAS FRISKS SHIRT AS A CAPE
[6:06:28] <%TheImmortal70> @silverira And kris is an entirely different person serving as Chara's vessel
[6:06:31] <pwnjones> I'm commander shepard, and this is my favorite stem on the citadel.
[6:06:55] <OkamiDude15> if they actually put sans or any undertale character in smash what would the stage be? woopsThink
[6:06:55] <Divryne> @PeachSaliva Hope your friend is alright!

[6:07:01] <%galaxyswirl> i just looked it up but apparently the famly crest of the DREEMURRs is called the DELTA RUNE
[6:07:01] <Crankthulhu> The entire Undertale fandom is just Charlie in the mailroom right now
[6:07:05] <%yeeyeyee> i've never been so fucking psyched for anything as i am right now for this series
[6:07:07] <ekkieekk> @PeachSaliva an NPC in Undertale tells you that he wants you to meet his neighbors daughter, whos name is Suzy
[6:07:08] <+RadiatedImp> I'm so excited for tomorrow. This and crimefest is amazing
[6:07:11] <knomad2b> I think this games going to be getting analyzed for at least a year
[6:07:17] <arfsm95> i'm so fucking exited about deltarune, i already have an undertale tattoo, maybe a deltarune too?
[6:07:22] <Crankthulhu> And RIP people who didnt follow/know about the WD Gaster bullshit LUL
[6:07:31] <honeyman18> the most is a part of a cycle, will you continue it. it seems important
[6:07:36] <%TheImmortal70> @silverira But for sure we can say that Ras is Asriel goat boi, we're chara in some capacity, the monsters never went underground, and gaster + our observer character are fucking with the timeline now

[6:07:49] <honeyman18> moss
[6:07:51] <Huntercd> deltarune is just an anagram for undertale
[6:08:01] <knomad2b> i also liked this more than undertale overal.esp the battle system
[6:08:01] <%QuadraticGravity> @TheImmortal70 You have a weird definition of 'for sure'
[6:08:05] <%Spydurman> Sans is an anagram for Undertale
[6:08:07] <bsmusic> @Huntercd I think they know
[6:08:08] <Crankthulhu> One theory is Gaster scrambled the timeline to get back to reality, hence why everyone's name and life is "remixed"

[6:10:06] <%TheImmortal70> @QuadraticGravity I think these are some pretty DEFINITE conclusions looking at what we're shown. The things I'm not certain about are who "Asriel" is here, whether Kris is a normal human or is just straight up multipersonality chara
[6:10:07] <%Keyd00d> is this not social media
[6:10:09] <CaptainKarite> It doesn't leave this stream!

[6:11:21] <blackwolf4567> I don't want to keep it secret
[6:11:26] <HannibalBeerus> Putting out a post that says "FUCK YOU THIS HAPPENS" is different from seeing that someone is streaming the game

[6:12:34] <%yeeyeyee> if you play deltarune it deletes papyrus from your memories so you forget he existed
[6:12:39] <+Meekest> He came out and said "Paige is a bad person" and then did the Fortnite dance
[6:12:40] <$nitronLVIII> LUL
[6:12:40] <Angry_Ev1L> it deleted papyrus from the game when paige killed him in cold blood

[6:13:00] <DedlokPM> @PeachSaliva It's a troll. I didn't stream it and no papyrus for me. teenJOY
[6:13:00] <knomad2b> you killed him TWICE
[6:13:03] <%jiin6> SO MEAN
[6:13:05] <Wan6Saber> mor elike evily classy
[6:13:15] <DavidSanChan> Aggressively passive aggressive
[6:13:16] <shiny_prinny> sassily killing papyrus

[6:13:26] <+Meekest> Peach is making Papyrus fade away like Spider-Man did

[6:13:33] <+RadiatedImp> You heard it here first folks, deltarune is a DISSAPOINTMENT
[6:13:41] <Stright_S> but paige you made new friends along the way :D
[6:13:43] <%The_Lady_Alustriel> Mr. Toby I don't feel so good -Papyrus probably
[6:13:43] <faegbeard> "My Man" Pat thrown under the bus where he belongs
[6:13:44] <%SlugNut> Unless tomorrow just means when Chapter 2 comes out and we are all reading way too deep into it
[6:13:45] <HannibalBeerus> The more Peach seeks out Papyrus the more he ceases to exist
[6:13:45] <%NiktenKing> Paige got boneblocked
[6:13:46] <@mothmandraws> just wait paige part 2 is just a full papyrus dating sim, 4 hours of 1 on 1 papyrus romance
[6:13:54] <captainthunderwolf> @DedlokPM Obviously Toby Fox just knew you'd watch a stream and pre banned your copy of the game
[6:13:59] <+SagatAteMyCornFlakes> You should have not killed him maybe Kappa
[6:14:00] <Angry_Ev1L> game didn't show him so you would not be able to kill him AGAIN
[6:14:00] <OkamiDude15> maybe you would see him if you beat jevil woopsEZC there might be a possibility.... not
[6:14:01] <%Shadowpint> cheer200 First time cheering so hopefully I don't fuck this up, but I wanted to say hi. You're pretty cool and I wish I started watching you sooner. You and Pat have a great dynamic.

[6:14:52] <DedlokPM> @captainthunderwolf But I had no intnetion to do so until I beat it. teenJOY
[6:14:54] <$Sphincter_Spelunker> Is that like Danny Devito's rum ham
[6:14:55] <OkamiDude15> that shits fucked
[6:15:02] <captainthunderwolf> @DedlokPM What
[6:15:04] <%Aztec50> I think if you put in special names into the thing at the beginning, you get some special stuff
[6:15:09] <Tonyzx15> Its going to be hard to sleep after that ending
[6:15:16] <captainthunderwolf> @DedlokPM What's that? 'Intention'? That's how he knew.
[6:15:19] <%TheImmortal70> @peachsaliva If I had to ask a question, it would be what do you feel about the gameplay changes to this thing?
[6:15:24] <%The_Lady_Alustriel> Sphincter_Spelunker I like that it's Danny Devito's rum ham and not Frank Reynolds
[6:15:44] <infernopredator> What if you had to beat the boss to see him
[6:15:50] <DedlokPM> @captainthunderwolf but the intentiond did not exist until after
[6:15:52] <$Sphincter_Spelunker> @The_Lady_Alustriel I'm sleepy. It's funnier this way
[6:16:02] <Prevot> it's WAY better IMO
[6:16:03] <%Shadowpint> @PeachSaliva I just got a great idea, I should draw you and Pat as the Dark Fuck Squad
[6:16:08] <%The_Lady_Alustriel> Sphincter_Spelunker happy little accidents result in the best humour
[6:16:11] <knomad2b> yeah the acting systems much more fleshed out. having a party changes everything

[6:16:31] <cizal11> @AngriestPat in the first game you could also techincally fight until their name turned yellow and then spare, but it seems to be a full mechanic now

[6:26:10] <eco419> niceu
[6:26:15] <Wan6Saber> 69 tenchiAyy
[6:26:19] <blackorchidKI2> Can't wait to see fan art (porn) of this game, now Kappa
[6:26:25] <Stright_S> ^
[6:26:31] <b1gboss007> MAKE PAPYRUSS AN WALUIGI ECHO
[6:26:37] <rosemon5001> ASSAULT ALL
[6:26:43] <%The_Lady_Alustriel> keep Waluigi outta Smash
[6:26:44] <captainthunderwolf> @b1gboss007 Genuinely a good idea.
[6:26:49] <%ssjklyco> Papyrus is DETERMINED to Smash
[6:26:50] <$ooblagis> It's legit some Kingdom Hearts shit
[6:26:52] <%yeeyeyee> that's the beginning of the trip
[6:26:53] <Angry_Ev1L> IT WAS ISEKAI
[6:26:55] <Graxe_> Elmo is actually really bright on stream.
[6:26:57] <Stright_S> it was a red haring
[6:26:58] <cerberuscarmine> papyrus is behind it all
[6:27:01] <Stright_S> for the spooks
[6:27:03] <eco419> mmmmm
[6:27:08] <%bevyrage> when deltarune loads up and then defracts it makes a big eye with the red heart
[6:27:11] <$ooblagis> The Darkners are clearly like parts of "real" people
[6:27:19] <Stright_S> it was Halloween after all
[6:27:29] <Prevot> I'm a big fan of the double mouth monster design
[6:27:30] <eco419> awwwww LOOK at the baby
[6:27:43] <mikesapartment> You actually can't kill any enemies, they all flee.
[6:27:52] <SailingSaturn> @PeachSaliva or the Heart is Peach
[6:27:55] <knomad2b> i kinda think tht kara does it every night
[6:27:59] <captainthunderwolf> A Kris, as noted, is also a kind of knife.
[6:28:01] <%NiktenKing> CH RIS
[6:28:06] <knomad2b> hence why u choose ur vessel
[6:28:08] <Stright_S> its a lil bit of column a lil bit of b
[6:28:10] <$Sphincter_Spelunker> Steel Ball Run
[6:28:10] <+RadiatedImp> I can't FUCKING WAIT
[6:28:11] <Angry_Ev1L> and she'll go kill papyrus
[6:28:15] <%SergeEXE> who knows?????
[6:28:16] <+Meekest> Did you notice how different Asriel's side of the room is from Kris's?
[6:28:20] <%SergeEXE> only toby
[6:28:30] <Them00n> Man this shit makes me miss Homestuck.
[6:28:31] <try_it_sis_> STEELE BONE RUN
[6:28:32] <Prevot> what if it's just kris cause it works for both genders? LUL
[6:28:35] <DLN002> THAT'S why Toriel keeps saying Kris can't ever wake up early
[6:28:37] <$ooblagis> I think both "you" and Chara are sharing control of Kris
[6:28:46] <$Agami23> isnt the kris the best weapon in symphony for dps?
[6:28:47] <DLN002> Chara's taking control every night
[6:28:52] <Animeshowfan> yeah it could easily be anything . I really hope toby gives some insight later
[6:28:56] <+Meekest> You are unbanned from ham sandwich day
[6:28:56] <captainthunderwolf> Never forget, Fallout 76 seppukus on arrival
[6:29:01] <grayjammer> I'd be super stoked if Kris is someone completely different from Frisk/FallenChilld entirely, and the deal they've got going on is something else from the post-genocide pacifist ending thing
[6:29:06] <faegbeard> Papy won't be in the full game because Toby is a fan.
[6:29:10] <%NiktenKing> I wonder if you get anything for using the cell phone in any specific room in the dark world
[6:29:19] <Donchalant402> @PeachSaliva in undertale after you play the game after a genocide run you see what looks like the reflection of chara in the puddle in waterfall, the reflection is actually kris, the eyes are shaded out the same way
[6:29:21] <Huntercd> moist
[6:29:29] <Graxe_> Can't wait for the clips of Thirst Paige to spread around
[6:29:30] <%ssjklyco> Pats gonna come home and see Skelmo in his bed.
[6:29:41] <%yeeyeyee> YEAH THAT'S A REAL THING
[6:29:43] <%SergeEXE> apatWrong apatWrong apatWrong apatWrong apatWrong
[6:29:44] <%yeeyeyee> THAT'S SUPER REAL
[6:29:45] <captainthunderwolf> @Prevot Toby's shown his hand at all this conspiracy pun bullshit, and I'd say it's mostly likely for all of the reasons stated above at once.
[6:29:46] <Stright_S> hmmmmm
[6:29:50] <Animeshowfan> papyrus will show up but he will be emo
[6:29:50] <+Arxel1> Hey, @PeachSaliva soooo did you notice there were no other humans than Kris in the game? What if they switched places in the game, and humans are in the underground (behind that weird steel door)
[6:29:52] <DLN002> Did they patch that in?
[6:29:53] <Stright_S> i vaguely remember that
[6:29:56] <+Meekest> That's so specific
[6:29:56] <Angry_Ev1L> sounds like super lies
[6:29:57] <%yeeyeyee> THEY PATCHED THAT IN
[6:29:59] <Divryne> That's bullshit. But I believe it.
[6:30:01] <%QuadraticGravity> @PeachSaliva yo it's super late for wiki diving, but there's a section in Waterfall NPCs on the wiki for an NPC called 'Clam Girl' if you wanna check it. Super relevant.
[6:30:03] <$ooblagis> The tone of this game makes it clear BAD SHIT is going to happen, you really want Papyrus to deal with the shit yet to come?
[6:30:06] <Donchalant402> ***
[6:30:13] <Donchalant402> sadly I cant post the image
[6:30:13] <Angry_Ev1L> nah
[6:30:14] <captainthunderwolf> Some Morlock shit.
[6:30:19] <Belutima> @PeachSaliva if you try to do a Pacifist run, AFTER a genocide run. it fucks up the pacifist 4ever
[6:30:19] <$ooblagis> The Angel the monster worship probably killed most humans
[6:30:19] <Prevot> humans under the bed and all
[6:30:20] <DLN002> Chara would make an AU like that
[6:30:22] <knomad2b> tht would be screwed up
[6:30:22] <$mister___doctor> Missed the chance to call it Under2le
[6:30:24] <DLN002> Chara super hates humanity
[6:30:26] <+RadiatedImp> PLEASE LET SUSIE LIVE
[6:30:32] <OkamiDude15> so has chara been retconned to actually be kris? woopsThink
[6:30:37] <knomad2b> i swear if anyone dies
[6:30:39] <%theo_marks> christ pat
[6:30:40] <DLN002> Susie is super dead by the end
[6:30:40] <Stright_S> AND HOPES N DREAMS STARTS PLAYING
[6:30:42] <DavidSanChan> chara is so mean he is a real monster
[6:30:43] <%theo_marks> thats a bit graphic
[6:30:43] <$Agami23> didnt the intro show humans in dark and monsters in light?
[6:30:46] <Stright_S> AND YOU SAVE THE DAY
[6:30:46] <captainthunderwolf> The humans emerge and they've devolved into albino cave trolls.
[6:30:46] <DedlokPM> Did you guys hear about how character speed is tied to framerate in Fallout 76? And it's because of a known bug that has been in their engine since morrowind? And that they had no reason until now to fix it and yet they still did not fix it before the beta? @PeachSaliva teenJOY
[6:30:51] <eco419> pull my devil trigger
[6:30:51] <+Arxel1> And Noelle was scared of 'humans under the bed', so they are like the scary monsters
[6:30:52] <gslayer14> or chara finally found a world with no humanity
[6:30:52] <Triplicat> chapter 2 begins with chara having murdered the entire town in the night
[6:30:57] <+Meekest> How sad will you be if Chapter 2 starts with you murdering the fuck out of Susie and Raseil
[6:31:01] <%yeeyeyee> fight your college aged gote brother and he kicks your goddamn ass into hell
[6:31:02] <OkamiDude15> THERE WILL BE BLOOD! (blood) SHED! (shed) woopsHyper
[6:31:05] <+RadiatedImp> EXTREMELY SAD
[6:31:06] <%The_Lady_Alustriel> You should really check out the Wiki entry for Clam Girl in Waterfall, it's relevant
[6:31:10] <Bailey__gaming> I just got in I work up at the end
[6:31:15] <%theo_marks> Susie would not let you murder her come on
[6:31:18] <knomad2b> omg imagine if it forces you to play as kara
[6:31:20] <%theo_marks> she'd fuckshara up
[6:31:22] <Donchalant402> @PeachSaliva sent you the image on twitter
[6:31:26] <$Sphincter_Spelunker> That salad is gross
[6:31:28] <gslayer14> Susie pulls her face off and it's just Papy
[6:31:32] <+SatsumaVA> @PeachSaliva Where's the recipe for this salad!? xD
[6:31:43] <captainthunderwolf> @Arxel1 Yeah man, never forget that monsters are canonically made of dust compared to human flesh in Undertale. We're basically Lovecraftian hyperbeasts made of super matter to them.
[6:31:54] <+Ell1ot> are you talking about your salad cauldron full of drugs?
[6:31:57] <Bailey__gaming> is there two Elmos?
[6:32:15] <%SiameseSneeze> apatDab sipsipHellmo sipsipDab

[6:35:18] <Futurecity10> God dammit there is already gay porn of Rasiel
[6:35:20] <DedlokPM> @DirtyDeedsDunDirtCheap well it is like a 3-4 hour long game play at average.
[6:35:25] <+Mike190Twitch> Jack it to the Fuck Squad
[6:35:27] <Bouldus> lol no you dont want a jacket that says fuck squad
[6:35:28] <$Sphincter_Spelunker> Take off you pants and jacket
[6:35:29] <$Agami23> oh shit. i was too busy playing deltarune to notice the 9 pm update. super hype for that new LP
[6:35:31] <Animeshowfan> im honestly kinda sad chapter 1 is free its so. good I want to buy it
[6:35:32] <+hatesdps> dicks up for fuck squad
[6:35:32] <Vega32X> the jacket would say Dark Fuck Squad
[6:35:39] <%The_Lady_Alustriel> you could probably jack it to the fuck squad in like 3 weeks. 3 weeks seems reasonable for porn to appear
[6:35:45] <Triplicat> there was exactly one porn picture of ralsei on pixiv when I checked
[6:35:47] <Sensator> that camera is quite out of focus
[6:35:48] <%GeneralSCPatton> It was FUN Squad done with emotes
[6:35:52] <knomad2b> not gonna like, it made me tear up a few times
[6:36:01] <$ooblagis> There are MANY, just many of them are also porn
[6:36:02] <DLN002> @Triplicat That was fast. The 24h period isn't even over yet!

[6:36:22] <Lord_Magtok> There'll be porn by tomorrow morning. That's the real reason why Toby wants us to wait 24 hours.
[6:36:24] <+SatsumaVA> Where can I find the recipe for that cauldron salad?
[6:36:39] <knomad2b> there was porn within minutes
[6:36:40] <Bouldus> dead af
[6:36:40] <+hatesdps> fuck squad rolls deep sbfpWipeouts
[6:36:44] <$ooblagis> And in case anyone is wondering, there are already DOZENS of porn drawings for every main character

[6:37:03] <Stright_S> PogChamp
[6:37:08] <cizal11> LMFAO
[6:37:17] <knomad2b> that was the WORST
[6:37:18] <Prevot> does Paige know how to solve Captchas?
[6:37:19] <$Sphincter_Spelunker> @SatsumaVA Check her reddit. It honestly might be on one of the Undertale VoDs. Just check the comments
[6:37:20] <cerberuscarmine> "hard"
[6:37:20] <Stright_S> 694
[6:37:21] <Bailey__gaming> @peachsaliva it looks like there are two elmos
[6:37:24] <Stright_S> couple more people
[6:37:25] <+Ell1ot> how can this be?!
[6:37:35] <$nitronLVIII> "puzzles"
[6:37:48] <+hatesdps> are captchas puzzles
[6:37:54] <+Gravity_Gunner> Can we actually prove Paige isn’t a robot if she can’t solve captchas?
[6:37:59] <cerberuscarmine> ;o;
[6:38:10] <%Shadowpint> I... really should have turned SFW mode on cuz I didn't really wanna see r34 of kids
[6:38:12] <knomad2b> it's ok. i saw someone take ten mins on the 1st puzzle
[6:38:16] <cerberuscarmine> it makes you FEEL like spiderman
[6:38:30] <grayjammer> @Shadowpint :( i feel u man
[6:38:39] <Animeshowfan> its ok man. hope you will be ok
[6:38:42] <captainthunderwolf> @Shadowpint Yeah dog, that's a genuine hazard. Gotta keep sharp.
