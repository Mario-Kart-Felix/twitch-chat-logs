[0:05:03] <+polothegreatest> doodWat
[0:05:03] <+Shockrates20XX> Alright, is this gonna be V-Paige or Flesh Paige?
[0:05:14] <JackaxeAM> Unga Bunga
[0:05:22] <@SoFarFetched> I assume no vtubing as there isn't a tag in the stream for it.
[0:05:27] <+TheDwarvenBard> Why not Vlesh Paige
[0:05:30] <@SoFarFetched> since she usually tags Vtuber when she does it.
[0:05:32] <+Chimeraelite> oh shit we mon hun?
[0:05:35] <%Sotetsu> Maybe we'll get Elmo.
[0:05:35] <MyNameIsRasus> Vlesh the Stampaige

[0:05:47] <%skm742> skm742 subscribed with Prime. They've subscribed for 34 months! I'm using this to say that throwing hammer in blue mode (RT+B) at the start of the hunt and forgetting about it is a great help for beginners. Blue mode won't get you punished nearly as much (no long spinny move), and you can just learn the 2 modes later.
[0:05:54] <solfuture> wonder if Eli will grace us with his presence
[0:06:13] <TurtlesAndTentacles> Does anyone ever fear parasocial relationships that streaming creates?
[0:06:13] <+TheDwarvenBard> Well now I wanna see dumb art of peach in Vash's dumb coat

[0:06:32] <%gnarly_memes_bro> yah I just kinda prefer blue mode for hammer in general
[0:06:35] <@PatStaresAt> I just grab it every now and then for hammer
[0:06:38] <$chance_h> oh hey it's a pat
[0:06:40] <%Sotetsu> I'm wondering if Pat will be hunter rank 20. psaBougie
[0:06:42] <@PatStaresAt> for variatio I mean
[0:06:54] <MyNameIsRasus> Humanoid Typhoon is a REALLY apt descriptor for Paige

[0:06:56] <%Sotetsu> Oh hi Pat

[0:16:42] <Admiral_PopnFresh> @Mattais88 some mammals lay eggs

[0:17:15] <Tracazoid> I learned to shave on my own, so yeah, kids will do it even without instruction.
[0:17:20] <+blastyoboots> What happened was **THE** inevitable result of her Mom's stonewalling, and she realized her parenting mistake as soon as she was told the consequences
[0:17:21] <Admiral_PopnFresh> beard shaving

[0:17:24] <+NWR_James> NWR_James subscribed with Prime. They've subscribed for 52 months! I too "accidentally" "shaved" my eyebrow decades ago and still have a sharp line where no hair grows.

[0:18:02] <+RickyJZ> You're gonna play Monster Hunter: Rise? Awesome! I've been loving this game! Put about 24 hours into it so far.
[0:18:04] <%Dakuu75> So, Pat sees it.
[0:18:05] <+meatguyjay> I grew up without a functional father so I had to learn the whole shaving thing myself. My neck looks like a goddamn dalmatian.

[0:18:32] <+TheDwarvenBard> Be a badass! use a straight razor

[0:18:33] <BigFingerRo> for realzies mistakes

[0:18:38] <%Grimlockfly> Grimlockfly subscribed with Prime. They've subscribed for 9 months! my eyebrows are all crooked cuz i thought all dogs loved me as a small child and met the first one that didn't

[0:18:48] <+Emperor_Machinus> I sneezed while shaving one time and broke the razor on my face on time
[0:18:51] <%Ranryu692> have you?
[0:18:53] <Mattais88> Electric scares me, I want to know any fuck ups are one me
[0:18:55] <%ospreyworks> Started using one of those actual razor blades and yeah, mistakes with one of those are not forgiving

[0:19:04] <+OG_M_Bison> Sounds the same to me
[0:19:05] <jetpack_rorschasch> I taught myself, which is why I'm known as "fucked up face jimmy". LUL
[0:19:07] <ligerisnotcrash> a switch axe is basically a straight razor for monsters
[0:19:08] <+Panties222> I cut my lip shaving before a job interview and I held a kleenex to my face the entire time....I didn't get the job.
[0:19:09] <Admiral_PopnFresh> My dad did, asshole
[0:19:11] <%ssjklyco> The trick is to use the electric razer to get as close to the skin, then use a razer .

[0:43:09] <Nordguy> a girl was high key into me until i crushed her in dragon ball budokai tenkaichi
[0:43:09] <+Logoth_> Using only one eye would fuck up your eyes
[0:43:12] <%Ranryu692> doesn't seem worth the depth perception
[0:43:15] <%g0atmeal> you know what's even cooler? empty eye socket
[0:43:15] <solfuture> Pirates supposedly wore them to see below deck
[0:43:17] <Dova573> Chuunni Paige
[0:43:20] <Dova573> is great

[0:43:33] <%skrewarrior> you can't see anyway. might as well look cool
[0:43:35] <$cooldude69xx> Pirates wore eyepatches with both eyes still, sot theyd have an eye that's used to the dark of being below deck
[0:43:35] <%ForneusAtSeaWorld> got my wrist slashed by chickens looked like an emo till the scar whitened.
[0:43:35] <TheAntiNihilist> You said it to her face?

[0:44:00] <+Emperor_Machinus> @Admiral_PopnFresh Also this was in Mexico. Fists run rampant in school. the second I got picked on again in the US and beat them up suspended with a psych eval. But bulling never stopped they were more cautious of me though.

[0:44:21] <%GabeSweetMan> It took me AGES to realize the joke Megumin is based on. She's a chuuni in a fantasy setting where there's literally no point in being chuuni because you ACTUALLY have those powers and I just never got it until like 6 months ago.

[0:44:26] <PlaidisTheNewPlaid> I can't believe that Paige hates that girl with the eyepatch, because she stole the D away from her.

[0:47:06] <%king_wragles> BRB to console the cat and uh, the other thing
[0:47:11] <+BigCoffee> My mom used to be girl bullied when she was in high school. So she just went around and beat the shit out of her bullies 1 by 1 and was left alone after. That's her technique
[0:47:12] <%SilverJakler> Elmo: "mother hello-" Paige: *screams bloody murder*

[0:47:35] <+Chimeraelite> Dude wtf
[0:47:37] <+LokimenD> just suplex them
[0:47:39] <Pookiedaexzile> You gotta do the same thing
[0:47:43] <+Chimeraelite> from 3rd to 7TH???
[0:47:47] <MyNameIsRasus> Punch her nose in
[0:47:49] <$hattrick61> ztarget her ballsa
[0:47:53] <%CptCreampuff16> just z target the girl in the ovaries
[0:47:54] <+Stormzcales_Lair> Self defense classes exist....
[0:47:56] <tentavision> probably work on a girl too, just beat her up every day
[0:48:00] <+JenovasPuppet> Server her parents to her in a chili.
[0:48:04] <%GabeSweetMan> Girls are WAY more spiteful. I feel like physically attacking them would only make them double down.
[0:48:05] <unfathomarble> z-target her locker with drugs
[0:48:09] <+cvp5127> was she a lich?
[0:48:10] <%ssjklyco> Moving schools would likely not stop bullying, just change who is the bully.
[0:48:14] <+ThomasOfTroy> Can confirm that's how to deal with male bullies. I had to semi-choke one of mine to stop the problem
[0:48:20] <%optimasmaximas> YESSIR THATS WHAT WE LIKE TO HEAR
[0:48:22] <+polothegreatest> gym solves bullying doodWat
[0:48:24] <OvaltineDream> Thtat's good
[0:48:28] <+Chimeraelite> So I'm not a violent person but If you're bullying my buddy for that long I'm pushing their shit in
[0:48:35] <QueequegTheater> @PeachSaliva I got bullied once, and threw the private school kid who was doing it off a pier.
[0:48:38] <Pookiedaexzile> Violence stops bullying
[0:48:39] <MyNameIsRasus> My mom was bullied in school, until she got an iron cable and literally whipped the girl with it
[0:48:41] <+McSoliace> you can fight guy bullies, girl bullies are horrible with there bs
[0:48:56] <%Bluwizard21> So who has the clip of her screaming over elmo?
[0:48:59] <+Urgotfantasy> bullying stopped for me pretty much the moment high school started, everyone just kind of chilled out
[0:48:59] <+WeLucklessJacks> It sounds like the solution to girl bullying is to kick the bully's shit in.
[0:48:59] <Admiral_PopnFresh> Trauma from guilt?
[0:49:00] <$cooldude69xx> Ah, the Cry Bully
[0:49:01] <Sowlith> she thought you cursed her
[0:49:05] <cureneckbeard> Paige how dare you make her feel bad for bullying you
[0:49:05] <%GabeSweetMan> Oh yeah playing the victim is such a common strategy for girl bullies.
[0:49:05] <+JenovasPuppet> Yeah because you deserved it! Apparently.
[0:49:05] <%g0atmeal> sounds like a bad household for that girl
[0:49:14] <+pectusumbra> Literally the worst people.
[0:49:19] <PlaidisTheNewPlaid> She mad cause bad

[0:49:29] <+ThomasOfTroy> Woooooow, that's fucking brutal
[0:49:29] <+BigCoffee> you have a shit school
[0:49:30] <+blastyoboots> If I were to have a daughter and figured out which girl was bullying her, what if I took that tiny girl aside in a hallway by the hair and threatened her life and her family if she ever did or TOLD anyone to do anything bad to you again?
[0:49:34] <+BigCoffee> BEAT HER UP
[0:49:36] <+LokimenD> well, now you're married to Pat so who's the winner now?
[0:49:38] <+BigCoffee> ALWAYS BEAT THEM UP
[0:49:40] <tentavision> THE TEACHERS SHOULD HAVE USED THEIR ONE
[0:49:41] <%GabeSweetMan> Pat's policy would work I bet.
[0:49:42] <+BigCoffee> THATS THE ONE WAY
[0:49:42] <Chaos_Aether> what a prude that girl was
[0:49:44] <TurtlesAndTentacles> Your teachers are shit
[0:49:45] <+WeLucklessJacks> Awwwwww :(
[0:49:47] <+blastyoboots> I mean it'd mean prison for me but would it work???
[0:49:47] <%GabeSweetMan> YOU GET ONE
[0:49:48] <$cooldude69xx> @blastyoboots That's a fast way to get arrested man
[0:49:48] <MyNameIsRasus> Violence is always the answer
[0:49:49] <DianaTheAscian> BEAT THEM ALL
[0:49:50] <+BigCoffee> AMBUSH THE BITCH WITH A HOCKEY STICK
[0:49:50] <TurtlesAndTentacles> tell her parents
[0:49:51] <leinadtonu> Fuck that girl. Pardon my french.
[0:49:51] <+nivlac_555> geez
[0:50:00] <+Shockrates20XX> You showed her by shaving your eyebrow off.
[0:50:00] <@CreepyPorpoise> ahhh, bad parenting
[0:50:05] <+RahkshiLord> sleepovers suck anyway
[0:50:05] <+blastyoboots> @blastyoboots Yes but would it WORK
[0:50:07] <+ThomasOfTroy> @blastyoboots That's a pretty good way to get arrested real fast
[0:50:07] <%ForneusAtSeaWorld> if you're gonna fight, do it in the lunchroom. no after-school bullshit.
[0:50:07] <DoubleRrico> all the teachers already used their 'One'
[0:50:08] <TurtlesAndTentacles> I'm sorry Paige you should have beat her ass
[0:50:09] <PlaidisTheNewPlaid> Her mom didn't look at you because she knew her daughter was a bitch
[0:50:11] <Rickbane> just z target the calmostimy bag
[0:50:14] <cureneckbeard> Did she finally develop a conscience
[0:50:14] <sleepystardewfarmer> what a terrible mom???
[0:50:15] <+blastyoboots> @blastyoboots BUT WOULD IT WORK THOUGH

[0:50:26] <EDFscout> OOF
[0:50:27] <Laecerelius> Oh no, how terrible for her!
[0:50:28] <+TheDwarvenBard> She could STOP BULLYING. MAYBE.
[0:50:29] <Mattais88> but never apologize, that's a step too far
[0:50:30] <Nahual_Amini> Fuck her

[0:50:31] <+TheotherKristian> oh wow, buck that fitch
[0:50:31] <$KnivesEve> guilty oh no
[0:50:32] <%ospreyworks> two girls did that to me in middle school
[0:50:32] <PlaidisTheNewPlaid> Oh no, physical proof of the awful shit I did, better run away
[0:50:41] <PlaidisTheNewPlaid> More people need to not have children
[0:50:41] <+vanareus> tragic back story
[0:50:41] <leinadtonu> Still. Fuck her.
[0:50:41] <TurtlesAndTentacles> YEAH PAT
[0:50:42] <QueequegTheater> @PeachSaliva I got bullied once, and threw the uppity private school kid who was doing it off a pier.
[0:50:43] <+TheDwarvenBard> YES YOU CAN FORCE THEM. SUPLEX THE CHILDREN UNTIL THEY CEASE4
[0:50:43] <+BigCoffee> Beat her up
[0:50:43] <@SoFarFetched> @blastyoboots you'd definitely get arrested and "possible" kidnapping because you're forcefully taking a girl away. Alos more reason for people to stay away from you cause you'd seem pretty unhinged.
[0:50:44] <%CptCreampuff16> Beat the shit out of her
[0:50:45] <+Stormzcales_Lair> kick.. in teeth....
[0:50:45] <jetpack_rorschasch> Oh no, that poor girl. DansGame
[0:50:47] <+ocelotshotfirst> Just don't bully
[0:50:48] <PlaidisTheNewPlaid> Yes
[0:50:49] <+greasypete00> beat her
[0:50:49] <Admiral_PopnFresh> LIKE YAGAMI
[0:50:50] <%king_wragles> Krampus
[0:50:51] <+Chimeraelite> If I'm a little girl, yea. Ima push your shit in if you bully my friend
[0:50:54] <%king_wragles> You're thinking of Krampus
[0:50:55] <+Infernal_Dalek> Lil Punisher
[0:50:55] <+ocelotshotfirst> Many people don't!
[0:50:57] <+pectusumbra> Could send her to Silent Hill or something. Grats to woolie finishing that tonight
[0:50:57] <Nahual_Amini> Yeah, beat her
[0:50:58] <Rickbane> empathy the biggest killer
[0:50:58] <MyNameIsRasus> Baseball bat to the face
[0:50:59] <DianaTheAscian> Beatings
[0:50:59] <jetpack_rorschasch> Pat is right.
[0:51:00] <PlaidisTheNewPlaid> Every teacher gets one policy
[0:51:00] <+BootyFriend> man, that's so rough. my sister and I tag teamed our bully's asses
[0:51:01] <%CptCreampuff16> jump her
[0:51:04] <@CreepyPorpoise> children shouldnt be comfortable being unrelenting assholes to others in front of their parents
[0:51:05] <eyeobject> What if she thought you were hot and she couldn't express love?
[0:51:06] <%g0atmeal> that would just strengthen the bullies, natural selection
[0:51:06] <+bottomlesscoffin> fight the mom
[0:51:06] <$KnivesEve> so instead of blaming themselves, they blamed the beasts
[0:51:07] <Chaos_Aether> the pat policy
[0:51:09] <PlaidisTheNewPlaid> Based Pay with the facts
[0:51:10] <LVL1_Scumbag> The beatings will continue until morale improves
[0:51:11] <%W1nterTitan> every teacher gets one
[0:51:11] <rReizs> nothing is stopping pat from fulfilling his dreams
[0:51:12] <unfathomarble> Ask a teacher for is ONE TIME
[0:51:13] <+JenovasPuppet> Chat has chosen violence
[0:51:13] <Veluren> This reminds me of the "Every Teacher gets One" conversation
[0:51:13] <+WeLucklessJacks> Going to a bully's sleep over sounds horrible.
[0:51:15] <$TenguGemini> public humiliation of bullies?
[0:51:16] <TurtlesAndTentacles> BEAT HER ASS
[0:51:19] <%ssjklyco> Hire a detective to pose as a student and suplex kids
[0:51:19] <%maskofmichael> Hire a therapist?
[0:51:21] <+BubbaRands> Pay people to bully her
[0:51:21] <$rdark_ksu> What if you had a cattle prod?
[0:51:21] <+ThomasOfTroy> @blastyoboots Your kld would lose a parent and get bullied for having a batshit insane one that's in prison. It wouldn't work
[0:51:23] <+TheotherKristian> Simple solution: Suspension...via wedgies
[0:51:27] <+Emperor_Machinus> We need girl hitmen who don't kill but beat up other girls their age.
[0:51:27] <$heythisisntdarksouls> Every teacher gets one! Throw her out a window.
[0:51:27] <+tempestzephyr> why do conversations with pat always lead to beating up kids LUL
[0:51:30] <Mattais88> Go hang out with the boys?
[0:51:31] <+Chimeraelite> *lots of broken noses*
[0:51:35] <ammobasket> Forced sleepover inclusion would just make for overnight bullying
[0:51:37] <+blastyoboots> @SoFarFetched I wouldn't be taking her away, I just meant take her aside two meters in a school hallway on a parent visit day or something like that for the five seconds  it would take to make my death threat
[0:51:45] <FunkyStreams> I think kids should be alowed to challenge eachother to duels
[0:51:46] <BigFingerRo> Man
[0:51:49] <Nahual_Amini> Beat them too
[0:51:50] <%JoshManVGH> Oh god Mean Girls is REAL!?
[0:51:50] <%skrewarrior> that's so fucked up
[0:51:51] <%hairtoday> girl stuff is messed up
[0:51:52] <Grizzytron> This is why every teacher should get One
[0:51:54] <+Chimeraelite> Woooow so she's a weak willed piece of shit. Neat
[0:51:54] <QueequegTheater> @PeachSaliva Unfortunately, the only solution is making sure during recess no teachers are looking, and just beat her ass
[0:51:55] <PlaidisTheNewPlaid> Did she turn out to be a lesbian and was actually in love with you?

[0:52:20] <@SoFarFetched> @blastyoboots Then you'd also be putting a bigger target on your daughters back as she would know be the kid with the "unhinged parent" who wants to beat up little girls. You'd also get shunned by other parents/teachers.

[0:53:30] <DianaTheAscian> They do it to make themselves feel nice
[0:53:30] <@SoFarFetched> @blastyoboots Are you ACTUALLY trying to excuse  yourself to to find a reason to be cruel to a kid? geefAwk you might wanna rethink your life choices.
[0:53:31] <PlaidisTheNewPlaid> They only did it, because otherwise that girl would be mad at them
[0:53:35] <+ThomasOfTroy> @SoFarFetched A. Many schools have cameras, B. They'd believe her, and C. Maybe you shouldn't yet
[0:53:38] <%ForneusAtSeaWorld> tie her hair to something and play tetherball.

[0:54:19] <MyNameIsRasus> LUL LUL LUL
[0:54:19] <%Bluwizard21> My bullies became friends after a couple years. cause we had a total of 50 people in my school between 4 grades
[0:54:20] <solfuture> @peachsaliva Pat imparted us with some of your wisdom on the podcast about "not trusting self described story-tellers" Any stories behind that?
[0:54:22] <+goose_attack_almanac> hah
[0:54:26] <%hairtoday> do you though
[0:54:27] <tentavision> FINALLY THANK YOU
[0:54:27] <+Emperor_Machinus> Pat speaks the truth
[0:54:33] <%ChrisPlaysThing> My graduating year had something like a 70% mortality rate, most did not live to reach my age, 30.
[0:54:34] <cureneckbeard> is pat in a different room or something
[0:54:39] <Admiral_PopnFresh> @Bluwizard21 jesus
[0:54:41] <%GabeSweetMan> Is that a story from ages ago? That sounds familiar.
[0:54:41] <%cade_calrayn> What did you name your Palico, Paige?
[0:54:42] <%ForneusAtSeaWorld> and Tupperware parties
[0:54:42] <MicrotonalMatt> Pat is on fire tdogBruh
[0:54:43] <@CreepyPorpoise> it's weird being able to hear paige so well and having pat so low
[0:54:45] <MyNameIsRasus> @ChrisPlaysThing American?
[0:54:48] <@CreepyPorpoise> what a twist
[0:54:48] <PlaidisTheNewPlaid> You should have tricked them into a threesome, but then not shown up, and it's just two guys trying to cheat on their wives naked in a hotel room. Classic
[0:54:53] <my2k_> ahahahah
[0:54:54] <%ChrisPlaysThing> Most died to to suicide, others, stupidity.
[0:54:56] <SulfurousAcid> it's the courier PogBones

[0:55:12] <%JoshManVGH> Pat is even quieter.
[0:55:12] <DianaTheAscian> it's fine
[0:55:14] <%FacetiousAF> this is clearly pat's fault
[0:55:14] <Admiral_PopnFresh> its fine
[0:55:15] <+RickyJZ> It's okay
[0:55:16] <%asthanius> That’s normal
[0:55:16] <+AmanisHouseOfNonsense> All good Paige
[0:55:17] <Dova573> @Emperor_Machinus that sucks, When I moved to texas the schools here have a significant amount of hispanic students, so I got put into bilingual classes so that wasant  as much of a big deal
[0:55:17] <DoubleRrico> no worries
[0:55:17] <+Havictos> YOU GET ONE UNTIL IT'S DONE

[0:55:36] <+Taisuru> Pat getting smaller by the second
[0:55:37] <@SoFarFetched> @blastyoboots How about you just relax and not thing about these "unhinged" thoughts of "what ifs" if you're never planning to have a kid. Also you'd be literally doing permanent damage to a kid because she'd be seeing a grown up suddenly grab her by the hair and her first thought is probably gonna be you might ACTUALLY murder her.
[0:55:37] <leinadtonu> It's your stream, and it also is quite relatable.
[0:55:37] <sleepystardewfarmer> we enjoy listening to your stories
[0:55:38] <+Kavtech> Ehh, people love hearing about that sort of thing, don't worry about it.

[0:55:51] <+Cthulos> Smol, smol egg
[0:55:52] <rReizs> Pat punching a child is a 50/50 gamble to make them even more angry and mean to other people
[0:55:54] <+JenovasPuppet> Pat is not loud
[0:55:54] <%GabeSweetMan> @PeachSaliva It's YOUR stream Paige. I didn't mean to dig up your old trauma with my question. Pour your heart out as much as you like.

[0:56:28] <+JenovasPuppet> It didn't change Pat at all
[0:56:29] <+N1netbattler> NAH

[0:58:55] <@SoFarFetched> @cooldude69xx well I've timed them out for a day as they've been getting more and more unstable with their thought processes geefCringe
[0:58:55] <%ChrisPlaysThing> He sounds like Eli did in that one Star trek stream, tinny due to audio peaking
[0:58:58] <+JenovasPuppet> Pat sounds like he's coming out of a blown out speaker but there's probably nothing you can do about that.

[1:00:23] <$shurtal> Hes talking in some incomprehensible dead language
[1:00:23] <+JenovasPuppet> Okay so the trick is that Pat needs to yell REALLY loud from downstairs, then run up and check the results of his own voice on stream
[1:00:23] <+RigmaroleHM> No worries
[1:00:23] <%maskofmichael> It's okay, kids are mean to everyone

[1:22:39] <bundle_of_herbs> before monster hunter 3 there was no lock on
[1:22:40] <+demon1103> That's why you must learn to not lock on....it takes some getting used to but is a lot better

[1:23:10] <BigYanno> "And that's how my story ends. My dog attacked me with a toy and I just fuckin died"
[1:23:10] <WillofGame> Does Zangief have occasions where he doesn't understand how big he is?
[1:23:15] <$Ralfclogs> Pat murdered by Gief
[1:23:22] <+demon1103> I actually hate lock-on because I accidently do it and it disorients me
[1:23:23] <$cooldude69xx> @bundle_of_herbs Every time I hear about how few features were in older MH games, I becomes more shocked the first game caught on
[1:23:32] <PanicSwytch> Bork

[1:24:24] <+demon1103> Spin to Win XD
[1:24:25] <%BogBodyPositive> agreed
[1:24:33] <+HelveticaScenario> That butt slam is adorable
[1:24:48] <%JoshManVGH> The bunny keeps trying to assert dominance but it doesn't seem to be working
[1:24:48] <+JenovasPuppet> So close!
[1:24:55] <jmft2000> Music kinda low
[1:24:57] <+notsoy> did paige not get her glasses yet?
[1:24:59] <SulfurousAcid> lagombi do be a speedy boy
[1:25:19] <Mattais88> ran like a coward
[1:25:20] <+Talhee> Yeah pat's right Dual Blades tear him up
[1:25:22] <julrave> for real like duel blades and light bowgun I like a lot more against big lads
[1:25:23] <SulfurousAcid> sharpen the dog
[1:25:31] <%Ranryu692> fuck it up, Elmo!
[1:25:33] <%grapplingwithdepression> elmo and gief in cahoots to bring down pat's playing level
[1:25:43] <Valdorick> Why aren't you crawling behind the TV, Pat?
[1:25:47] <%asthanius> horse is big dog
[1:25:48] <SulfurousAcid> dog horse
[1:25:49] <+SilverDevilfish> You can also sharpen while on the dog
[1:25:50] <+ShutUpAceyP> fluffy horse
[1:25:50] <+shadowxdemon0> saw the nyanners milk just now this should be a good palate cleanser LUL
[1:25:56] <+demon1103> Monsters have severe A.D.D.   Oh boy time to Fight let's do i....SHINY!!
[1:26:05] <slandracon> What are the chances Pat will let Peach join his regular hunting group?
[1:26:18] <Clear_Truth> Did they fix the save bug yet?
[1:26:20] <+JenovasPuppet> Good thing the dog can dig through solid rock
[1:26:43] <BigYanno> aww he roll limesAw
[1:27:04] <SulfurousAcid> ice blight
[1:27:05] <BlueSpartan119> ice blight, wirebug cooldown is slower now
[1:27:10] <Admiral_PopnFresh> its soft snow
[1:27:11] <+JenovasPuppet> This game is grounded in realism
[1:27:13] <BigYanno> Hunters are basically superheroes
[1:27:20] <%GabeSweetMan> Thankfully humans in the MH universe are made of titanium.
[1:27:23] <%Dakuu75> I just imagine the little wire-bug shivvering in its cage. Like that Lucky-Cricket from Mulan
[1:27:26] <EDFscout> Pat ya whiffed!
[1:27:26] <julrave> humans are just built different in monster hunter universe
[1:27:31] <+demon1103> I've never actually read that prompt. Didn't know it was the wirebug specifically that froze...huh
[1:27:47] <Flickerember> built tough but gotta smack monster 500 times
[1:27:53] <%Chichen> paige DO be bonkin him tho
[1:27:55] <Flickerember> all stat points into hp
[1:28:05] <+Talhee> @BigYanno Hunters basically caused the apocalypse before regulations were put into place because hundreds of them would go out killing everything
[1:28:31] <SulfurousAcid> are there not hot/cold drinks in this?
[1:28:34] <BigYanno> I used a Whetstone today! I sharpened ALL my knives! It was one of the most satisfying things I've done in a long time
[1:28:34] <+JenovasPuppet> LUL
[1:28:36] <+GinAndRoses> keep that hammer sharp
[1:28:37] <Rozalyndis> andyBONK
[1:28:37] <%GabeSweetMan> bonk
[1:28:45] <%grapplingwithdepression> god ive been playing dauntless (on the switch rip) bc i was waiting on the new monhan xpac and now i feel the worst fomo in the world oof
[1:28:55] <+demon1103> just gotta get into the habit of sharpen after the Monsters ADD kicks in and runs off
[1:28:55] <+BootyFriend> Page not using the quick wheel?
[1:28:58] <+JenovasPuppet> He's like a chameleon!
[1:28:59] <SulfurousAcid> camoflague
[1:29:10] <bundle_of_herbs> paige isn't even locked on
[1:29:23] <+Nekros4442> locking on sucks anyway
[1:29:30] <%GabeSweetMan> When sharpening or healing, it helps to go to a different elevation to avoid getting hit. It doesn't guarantee since sometimes they'll just target you outright, but it lowers the odds of getting merc'd mid animation.
[1:29:37] <%TheWinged7> @peachsaliva  remind pat to tell you about the quick item wheel
[1:29:38] <BlueSpartan119> Right Stick
[1:29:44] <%Chichen> locking on genuinely sucks in this game dont worry paige
[1:29:53] <BigYanno> that's such a dumb lock on system
[1:29:53] <%AncelDeLambert> the lock on sucks and is for nerds
[1:29:55] <+goose_attack_almanac> It's a silly thing
[1:30:01] <+shadowxdemon0> paige please
[1:30:02] <%Dakuu75> lol
[1:30:02] <Rozalyndis> listen to chat pattyHelping so hard right now
[1:30:02] <%Kevlar_Caviar> i do the same thing all the time, don't stress about it LUL
[1:30:02] <SulfurousAcid> "vague picture"
[1:30:04] <DoubleRrico> alot of them look the same it's not you
[1:30:04] <%GabeSweetMan> When glasses.
[1:30:09] <BlueSpartan119> the icons are pretty distinct
[1:30:10] <Rozalyndis> bunch o backseat bettys over here
[1:30:14] <%JoshManVGH> Not dumb, it is for sure arcane
[1:30:15] <Scorchfield> eh, lock on isn't all that useful in MH anyway
[1:30:17] <$cooldude69xx> The pictures aren't even the same between games, it actually is kind of confusing
[1:30:19] <+demon1103> Paige: I don't know how to lock on.   Us: That's the neat part.....you don't     XD
[1:30:20] <+JenovasPuppet> Alt-world where it says the name: "How am I supposed to remember the name?? Just give a picture!"
[1:30:22] <+gatdragon> Paige NotLikeThis

[1:43:15] <+Pendragon3d> there he goes
[1:43:24] <Buttku> no bulli
[1:43:27] <jacobknight13> His page grew up to be the biggest bully in Pat's life .......his wife

[1:44:54] <Tonyzx15> She also needs to get the Freebies from the mail cat I don't think she has done that
[1:44:55] <+thedannydarko> I know this was a switch game but does Paige not have the graphics turned up all the way?
[1:44:56] <$cooldude69xx> "My shipment of spider webs and mushrooms came in!"
[1:45:05] <%Ranryu692> drog drifting
[1:45:07] <AsterisTV> Yeah, you basically hire dogs and cats to go on missions for you
[1:45:10] <Sowlith> @PeachSaliva the game seems to be cut off on the edges very slightly
[1:45:11] <Mattais88> Deja vu!
[1:45:12] <DoubleRrico> i wonder what bartering with a dog is like
[1:45:24] <vonmaultke> Tetranodon is like Great Jagras and Jyuratodus put together and better than both of them
[1:45:40] <BlueSpartan119> if you wirebug into the wall you can just run up it
[1:46:02] <$cooldude69xx> @vonmaultke Not high bars admittedly, but the sumo duckapus is great anyway
[1:46:03] <my2k_> VORE MONSTER

[1:47:00] <Mattais88> Vore Turtle
[1:47:00] <adamant1333> vore
[1:47:03] <+thedannydarko> Is there a walking skeleton monster somewhere?
[1:47:09] <my2k_> wait I thought the vore monster was really big
[1:47:09] <$cooldude69xx> Peach was looking for a skeleton
[1:47:12] <my2k_> and a dinosaur
[1:47:22] <my2k_> this thing seems kinda cute and much smaller
[1:47:24] <BlueSpartan119> he's a big sumo kappa frog
[1:47:26] <%MarsKarl> YEAH HIT EM
[1:47:26] <Tonyzx15> Thank god this is not like world and has super big maps peach would never be seen again
[1:47:30] <+vanareus> Pat tried deflecting, it wasn't very effective
[1:47:33] <my2k_> jesus that noise it makes is so scary
[1:47:33] <%skrewarrior> beyblade is the best
[1:47:37] <my2k_> PLATYPUS

[1:48:04] <$cooldude69xx> @Tonyzx15 I played 400 hours of World, to this day, I can't find my way around the forest
[1:48:11] <my2k_> OH MY GOD
[1:48:18] <rasamune> No one can navigate the forest
[1:48:19] <+TestAnon> mpreg
[1:48:25] <DoubleRrico> though technically this is Inflation
[1:48:26] <SulfurousAcid> btw paige the first aid meds are the free ones
[1:48:27] <my2k_> oh he just like... inflates, he doesn't like, eat you. okay that's okay
[1:48:27] <%GabeSweetMan> Tags: Vore, Mpreg, Inflation
[1:48:30] <my2k_> he's like a frog
[1:48:31] <+notsoy> that's not vore, that's inflation, but probably still paige's fetish
[1:48:33] <my2k_> giant frog
[1:48:35] <+Chamapa_Stys> @Tonyzx15 ill second this
[1:48:37] <my2k_> yeah this is a different fetish
[1:48:43] <my2k_> an important distinction
[1:48:48] <+thedannydarko> Does this game have as much confusing verticality as World? The forest was hard to navigate
[1:48:54] <Intersceptre> forest is easy after 3000 hours of filling wildlife journal
[1:48:56] <+Fenrisulfr_V> Man, Monster Hunter looks fun. Sucks that the only time I tried to play it was at the behest of someone that told me "it's like Dark Souls, so you should like it."
[1:49:08] <my2k_> oh my god
[1:49:08] <+GinAndRoses> his weakness is throwing up
[1:49:12] <%Dakuu75> Punch him in the Orb
[1:49:14] <BlueSpartan119> @rasamune the secret to navigating ancient forest is to treat it like 3 maps in one
[1:49:14] <rasamune> @thedannydarko not really. There's verticality but the maps are pretty straightforward
[1:49:15] <ValkahRoctsteel> Hit the orb
[1:49:22] <Mattais88> got vored
[1:49:24] <%Dakuu75> SHE DID IT
[1:49:27] <DoubleRrico> @GinAndRoses my weakness is throwing up
[1:49:28] <%GabeSweetMan> GOOD JOB
[1:49:35] <vonmaultke> NOW comes the vore LUL
[1:49:39] <%Sotetsu> The vore has become the voree
[1:49:51] <my2k_> jesus christ

[1:49:58] <+JenovasPuppet> You deserve this vore

[1:53:06] <+thedannydarko> What weapon is Pat using?
[1:53:11] <%Kevlar_Caviar> i really hope we get to see her reaction to khezu this stream
[1:53:14] <%ForneusAtSeaWorld> yeah
[1:53:16] <BlueSpartan119> @thedannydarko duel blades
[1:53:29] <+Fenrisulfr_V> Is there a weapon in this that's a fast-ish single sword?
[1:53:34] <BlueSpartan119> he's been swapping like every hunt
[1:53:44] <Megafang2145> @Fenrisulfr_V SnS
[1:53:49] <%AncelDeLambert> that's what poison bombs are for
[1:53:51] <%GabeSweetMan> Killing them is a pain in the ass.
[1:53:51] <BlueSpartan119> @Fenrisulfr_V longsword, it's like a katana
[1:53:52] <+thedannydarko> Makes sense, would imagine Pat is fairly well versed
[1:53:56] <dwhanson> @Fenrisulfr_V there's a katana. and a Sword and Shield
[1:53:57] <Tonyzx15> wait isn't Khezu HR2 yeahh Pat is going to have her fight it for sure
[1:54:06] <Admiral_PopnFresh> Longsword for estra weeb
[1:54:07] <Intersceptre> longsword LUL
[1:54:09] <%QueequegTheater> The longsword is just a katana
[1:54:09] <JackaxeAM> Don't shake a Longsword players hand
[1:54:14] <%AncelDeLambert> if you're going bug hunting, always keep some poison bombs for it
[1:54:16] <HeroToxiko> there is also insect glaive
[1:54:17] <+Fenrisulfr_V> Is the Longsword two-handed or one-handed? I don't really like shields.
[1:54:18] <mr_saturday93> LUL
[1:54:18] <%Dakuu75> LOL
[1:54:19] <%Kevlar_Caviar> LUL
[1:54:23] <%GabeSweetMan> No credit for you pat.
[1:54:24] <Firststrike_OW> LUL
[1:54:24] <+JenovasPuppet> Suck it, Greg!
[1:54:25] <HeroToxiko> it adds flight to the speed
[1:54:27] <maskedmook> EMBARISSING
[1:54:27] <Megafang2145> Two handed
[1:54:29] <+Dunder_Mifflinz> Greg just wants the attention
[1:54:30] <Admiral_PopnFresh> @Fenrisulfr_V 2
[1:54:32] <+Fenrisulfr_V> Cringe.
[1:54:32] <Intersceptre> eject LS users from hunts, don't look at them
[1:54:32] <%GabeSweetMan> Get wrekt greg.
[1:54:33] <%Dakuu75> @JenovasPuppet HAH!
[1:54:38] <%Kevlar_Caviar> get owned, GREG
[1:54:40] <+notsoy> longsword is vergil
[1:54:41] <+vanareus> Notice? I just got the twitch ping
[1:54:48] <twoah> The sword and shield doesn’t really use the shield for defense. It’s for bashing faces in
[1:54:54] <Tonyzx15> Pat don't lie you enjoy this as much as we do
[1:54:54] <jetpack_rorschasch> WE'RE THE SPECIAL ONES PAT, NOT YOU!
[1:54:59] <+Fenrisulfr_V> Is there a skin for Sword and Shield that makes the shield invisible?
[1:55:01] <%GabeSweetMan> Dark Souls is the reason I got into MH.
[1:55:06] <Megafang2145> actually YES
[1:55:12] <maskedmook> @gabesweetman same
[1:55:12] <morningmoondude> You know what I mean?
[1:55:14] <%Dakuu75> just roll out the way, then grab their dick and twist it!
[1:55:14] <+Uulyaoth> this game is like if dark souls had good combat
[1:55:16] <%QueequegTheater> @Fenrisulfr_V There are no skins
[1:55:18] <Intersceptre> I might be one of the few people who had Monster Hunter prep me to play Dark Souls. DS is a joke after early MH games
[1:55:19] <morningmoondude> Drop your shield
[1:55:19] <+leviting> man you were just in my recommmendeds, no notice needed
[1:55:26] <%ForneusAtSeaWorld> even down to repairing weapons
[1:55:27] <%GabeSweetMan> Anticipation, wind-ups, positioning, etc.
[1:55:31] <+RadDude6969> I played MH before Dark Souls it's good training the other way around too
[1:55:34] <Megafang2145> @Fenrisulfr_V There are with the rampage weapons
[1:55:39] <%hairtoday> get WET
[1:55:49] <%GabeSweetMan> Ugh water-blight is the worst.
[1:56:00] <%GabeSweetMan> Fire blight is who cares. Just roll.
[1:56:02] <+Fenrisulfr_V> @Fenrisulfr_V That'll work, then.
[1:56:03] <twoah> @fenrisulfr_v Yes, the ninja sword and shield does that as well as the Akuma layered costume
[1:56:04] <%Dakuu75> "Dragon Blight" still kinda sounds like a buff, to me, for some reason.
[1:56:16] <Tonyzx15> It took my friend force buying me 3 monster hunter games before I got into it and never looked back
[1:56:19] <+SilverDevilfish> "often"
[1:56:21] <+JenovasPuppet> Papyrus stabbed her awake
[1:56:28] <Intersceptre> >blights as a Lance user psaDown
[1:56:30] <+TestAnon> KILL
[1:56:31] <+thedannydarko> Like all good buddies do
[1:56:36] <BlueSpartan119> big murder
[1:56:43] <DoubleRrico> remember to do the Heimlich maneuver to cure choking blight
[1:56:45] <%GabeSweetMan> Mud-blight is the funniest.
[1:56:49] <Megafang2145> @Fenrisulfr_V Yeah the Hi Ninja Sword is what you would be looking for
[1:56:51] <+JenovasPuppet> Yeah, killing!
[1:56:52] <+Logoth_> No music?
[1:56:53] <+thedannydarko> Of course Paige picks murder
[1:56:58] <%Dakuu75> I thought there was NO downside to capture, and you should always do it?
[1:57:10] <%QueequegTheater> @PeachSaliva Keep hitting B on that
[1:57:12] <dwhanson> @Dakuu75 sometimes murder is fun
[1:57:13] <+demon1103> Yay!! Good Paige. Killing is always the  answer!!!
[1:57:15] <+Fenrisulfr_V> Man, not enough games let me be the guy with just a one-handed sword without massively penalizing me.
[1:57:19] <HeroToxiko> tailcut + cap is pretty fun for minmaxing
[1:57:20] <%Kevlar_Caviar> @Dakuu75 nope, in this there's a bunch of slay-only parts
[1:57:23] <%Ranryu692> he's bald now
[1:57:27] <+JenovasPuppet> Good hammer hits!
[1:57:36] <BlueSpartan119> @Logoth_ music is super low but it's there
[1:57:37] <%ForneusAtSeaWorld> nice dodge
[1:57:38] <Intersceptre> i have 3000+ hours on world with ZERO monster kills except elders of course
[1:57:41] <%barkon345> @Dakuu75 thats in World.
[1:57:47] <+Dunder_Mifflinz> Kinda reminds me of Greg
[1:57:48] <%Dakuu75> oh...
[1:57:50] <taylorpony> Now him Pat
[1:57:56] <%Ranryu692> oh cool, I'm people
[1:57:57] <twoah> Some specific parts are tied to carves, some have higher chances with cap
[1:57:58] <%CatastropheCorvid> @Dunder_Mifflinz Old Greg?
[1:58:15] <%GabeSweetMan> Tantrum
[1:58:19] <%barkon345> @Dakuu75 in rise you can get different drops based on if you capture or kill
[1:58:20] <Pookiedaexzile> I'm Old Greg
[1:58:22] <Tonyzx15> No in Monster Hunter Rise capture is not the go to for every hunt anymore like world its now a part by part base
[1:58:23] <%bluetocho13> bluetocho13 subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 61 months! 
[1:58:27] <+MidnightBurst12> i'd be mad too if i was bald
[1:58:29] <ashenfrenzy> hell yeah ill be selfish
[1:58:33] <Latija> get the loot
[1:58:34] <%Dakuu75> yeah because those drop smight dissapear!
[1:58:38] <+JenovasPuppet> Pick it up when you see it so you don't forget
[1:58:41] <%ForneusAtSeaWorld> wow lucky
[1:58:52] <HeroToxiko> Your fyp is VERY specific
[1:58:58] <DianaTheAscian> I always grab them immediately
[1:59:00] <%GabeSweetMan> Well it depends. Sometimes the odds of the team wiping can result in "GET IT BEFORE WE WIPE."
[1:59:07] <+demon1103> I pick up because if I don't theres a 50% chance I'll forget
[1:59:12] <DoubleRrico> took me forever to learn tiktok wasn't just people talking about the Kesha song
[1:59:15] <BlueSpartan119> shinnies dont disappear anymore in Rise
[1:59:16] <BigYanno> My FYP is cute animals and cosplay THOTs
[1:59:17] <+chiazam> I'd love to see Pat's fyp I bet its weird
[1:59:23] <Tonyzx15> Bomb it shove them in his mouth
[1:59:27] <+GinAndRoses> or that big crater wirebug thing
[1:59:29] <+JenovasPuppet> NICE
[1:59:30] <twoah> In old games, grabbing shinies during the fight is almost required because they disappear so fast
[1:59:31] <%Ranryu692> 101
[1:59:33] <+withguac> Wasn’t pAt and woolie talking about how awful Tik Tok is on the podcast? When did they decide to give it a chance?

[2:02:07] <%Kevlar_Caviar> KHEZU TIME
[2:02:07] <+withguac> @latija yeah, I follow their offfial TikTok accounts. But I’m surprised because the podcast was specifically about how they didn’t like the fan accounts and TikTok

[2:07:50] <shinigaomi> Hey page quick hammer tip, if you charge your blue hammer to max and hit LT+B with 2 wirebugs you'll do a slow rising attack that ends in a big slam, it does a ton of damage to a stationary target. Happy Hunting!
[2:07:51] <+Logoth_> 10 minutes is pretty good
[2:07:53] <DianaTheAscian> I never bother with those ones
[2:07:56] <BlueSpartan119> booster is like a 10min damage boost
[2:07:58] <Hydrapissed> Booster Clap best one

[2:09:04] <$DensityD> meat can summon swarm of pirrahna
[2:09:07] <KingZaffy> You can put the meat bait down in the water to summon pirannhas to attack that location
[2:09:11] <%Dakuu75> -because Pat want's to STARE AT YOUR BUTT
[2:09:11] <Intersceptre> time for sponge
[2:09:12] <%Agami23> you can throw the bait in some areas to have piranha attack monsters
[2:09:18] <%AncelDeLambert> the bait is used to cause pirhannas to attack an area
[2:09:23] <%Fuggins4U> Fuggins4U is gifting 1 Tier 1 Subs to PeachSaliva's community! They've gifted a total of 13 in the channel!

[2:11:05] <Intersceptre> time for a wash
[2:11:14] <$Ralfclogs> Banana Dino
[2:11:21] <Hydrapissed> white = armored orange = soft
[2:11:22] <$DensityD> white is small, yellow is nice hit
[2:11:24] <BlueSpartan119> yellow is your hitting a weak point so good damage
[2:11:25] <Intersceptre> hammer = always hit head like 99% of time
[2:11:34] <Admiral_PopnFresh> Cookie Dough Komodo Dragon
[2:11:41] <%Fuggins4U> beefs
[2:11:47] <BlueSpartan119> KT
[2:11:48] <$DensityD> CONTROLLER DYING??!
[2:11:49] <BlueSpartan119> LT*
[2:11:56] <%Fuggins4U> LT
[2:11:58] <+Orcapugs> Yellow is stun damage
[2:12:03] <Hydrapissed> u need to sheathe to use it
[2:12:05] <%Dakuu75> LT + Button
[2:12:11] <KingZaffy> Your weapon is out
[2:12:13] <BlueSpartan119> LT+Y or LT+B
[2:12:14] <jmft2000> there is no music
[2:12:16] <+SilverDevilfish> You have to press other buttons with it
[2:12:26] <antimatter_man> Aim up
[2:12:29] <+nershrika> can't use wireless while weapons out
[2:12:31] <+TestAnon> when in tri you fight a quropeco for the second time and it summons a rathian instead of a jaggi
[2:12:40] <+nershrika> *wirebug
[2:12:41] <batspiderfish> you always have at least two wirebug moves
[2:12:41] <+Cthulos> @jmft2000 she turned it down to better hear Pat
[2:12:51] <+CalderGaming> how can this BE
[2:12:59] <$DensityD> we should be elitist and bully paige into working in the training area
[2:13:00] <%Fuggins4U> LT aims/arms it, the other button "fires" it
[2:13:05] <%Dakuu75> I think it's different, if you have your weapon sheathed
[2:13:08] <jmft2000> Oh thanks
[2:13:14] <Mattais88> when your weapon is sheathed
[2:13:19] <Intersceptre> @DensityD i'd settle for her hitting head slams
[2:13:32] <+thesickestzak> There’s a lot of button combinations to keep track of honestly
[2:13:34] <BlueSpartan119> the LT reticle is only when youre sheathed iirc
[2:13:42] <$DensityD> she's putting on a great stream either way
[2:13:49] <BlueSpartan119> it's for aiming the spiderman shit
[2:13:53] <%Fuggins4U> sipsipBaby_TK
[2:13:55] <+OrangeMDT> Didn’t Paige learn that yesterday?
[2:13:56] <Hydrapissed> FISH damage
[2:13:58] <Intersceptre> i need the heavy grand slams on the head for big bonk energy
[2:13:59] <%Dakuu75> wow, fuck that fish
[2:14:02] <+nershrika> if ya want an easier time sharpening, you can sharpen your weapon while riding your palimute! leaves ya less vulnerable while actively fighting monsters!
[2:14:03] <EDFscout> sharpen on dog to do it on the go
[2:14:04] <+Havictos> LUL
[2:14:10] <@Jekado> FEESH!
[2:14:12] <%Fuggins4U> sipsipBaby_TK rileyoLOVE sipsipBaby_TK rileyoLOVE
[2:14:14] <Tonyzx15> btw you can sharpen while on your dog that lets you sharpen and move
[2:14:14] <$DensityD> what if she tried a gunner weapon, which requires a different button for wirebug attacks
[2:14:20] <$DensityD> that would be suffering
[2:14:21] <%Fuggins4U> dog carves
[2:14:21] <Intersceptre> >gunners
[2:14:34] <antimatter_man> Don’t carve the dog
[2:14:34] <@Jekado> psaGib meowriiiFish
[2:14:37] <%Dakuu75> I noticed when you carve the deer, they get back up like nothing happened. it's metal
[2:14:42] <%Fuggins4U> i'm glad Paige seems to be enjoying this!
[2:14:44] <$DensityD> SabaPing
[2:14:45] <TehMud> Banana nana fofana
[2:14:51] <%Agami23> i played this game for so long before i realized i could throw meat in here
[2:14:58] <TehMud> Banana does make a nice hammer though
[2:15:00] <Intersceptre> i use HBG for when farming needs 40+ runs, thats it
[2:15:09] <jetpack_rorschasch> Are you humming the theme tune to Bathroom Boys Paige?
[2:15:13] <+Havictos> @PeachSaliva Pat how the fuck do you sharpen a hammer or gun?
[2:15:20] <$DensityD> darn, she keeps going into spinning bludgeon but stopping it after only 1 hit
[2:15:22] <%Fuggins4U> @Havictos carefully
[2:15:24] <%Dakuu75> @Agami23 you can? lol
[2:15:36] <tigerfang86> SHOW BANANA
[2:15:40] <Mattais88> I wish more hammer transformed
[2:15:46] <whimwhisp> looks good for banana bread now~
[2:15:54] <Intersceptre> ludroth was always reasonably resistant to ahmmer iirc
[2:15:56] <RushUnplugged> bananas got harvested
[2:16:01] <Intersceptre> or KO's at least
[2:16:15] <$DensityD> initiate wyvern riding
[2:16:19] <$DensityD> ride the banana
[2:16:39] <tigerfang86> banana cares not for your trivial matters
[2:16:43] <%Agami23> @Agami23 yeah, if you throw raw meat in here a swarm of piranha attack the monster
[2:16:48] <cloakofashes> Instructions Unclear: Moving more.
[2:16:49] <+Havictos> knock him out then do fancy moves
[2:17:02] <Intersceptre> did they remove slides and wall jumps from Rise? World Hammer is godly in some zones
[2:17:09] <%Kevlar_Caviar> yeah hammer's not great for ludroth, if stories 2 taught me anything
[2:17:21] <tigerfang86> he sad
[2:17:24] <+goose_attack_almanac> his shadow is on the ceiling
[2:17:28] <antimatter_man> Hit him in the face!
[2:17:29] <BlueSpartan119> his sponge is dry
[2:17:32] <%Dakuu75> holy shit, his shadow was on the ceiling
[2:17:39] <$DensityD> try to learn that tell, the one for the shoulder charge, loads of monsters do that
[2:17:46] <+MidnightBurst12> moldy banana
[2:17:54] <%ForneusAtSeaWorld> you can do the spinning hammer on command now guy in chat
[2:18:02] <%SophiaAmoreaVeritas> Git banana

[2:18:28] <%Kevlar_Caviar> hope they do bishaten this stream, def one of the cooler new rise mons that isn't an elder dragon
[2:18:28] <$Ralfclogs> Stinky Banana
[2:18:30] <$shurtal> Paige dont each this mold
[2:18:48] <$DensityD> do dog drifting, do dog jumping, do a leap off the dog so you can do air attack
[2:18:50] <%Bane_Kaikyo> Did Paige turn off the music?
[2:19:02] <$DensityD> khezu mode
[2:19:07] <%ForneusAtSeaWorld> yeah and an i frame move. hammers great
[2:19:17] <Intersceptre> World had glider mantle abuse for hammer which was also cool
[2:19:26] <+Emperor_Machinus> I can't stop hearing the hawk sound
[2:19:43] <$DensityD> come on, spinning bludeon more
[2:19:51] <+notsoy> use your first aid meds

[2:20:03] <Intersceptre> grand slam > spinning
[2:20:12] <churropoppa> try hit and running?
[2:20:27] <+kknutson4> spin 2 win
[2:20:30] <+Fooguwu> Paige is going to shid and card
[2:20:31] <rasamune> going back to MHFU and jesus christ I forgot how unwieldy Hunting Horn is in this game
[2:20:45] <%Agami23> i just realized that pat and paige kind of make a perfect combo. since one can cut tails and one can break heads
[2:20:48] <tigerfang86> Big Combo
[2:20:51] <%grapplingwithdepression> @rasamune i miss it so much
[2:20:55] <Latija> @Agami23 Couple goals
[2:20:58] <$DensityD> make paige use hunting horn instead Jebaited
[2:20:58] <Intersceptre> hunting horn got big glow up through Iceborne and Rise
[2:21:01] <%grapplingwithdepression> wait FU?
[2:21:02] <%grapplingwithdepression> nvm
[2:21:11] <%grapplingwithdepression> i thought you said GU
[2:21:22] <Radioactivetaco9> I feel bad for all the people who liked old horn more because now their weapon is just gone
[2:21:27] <Intersceptre> suprise. tail is a tail
[2:21:29] <Latija> a tail :o
[2:21:35] <ferbeholds> like his tail
[2:21:36] <+JenovasPuppet> The one downside of Hammer is you can't cut off tails
[2:21:37] <twoah> Does FU have that performance stance thing? I’ve always wanted to try it
[2:21:41] <+Emperor_Machinus> @Intersceptre Is tail based?
[2:21:45] <+OrangeMDT> Paige, I can see your other healing items
[2:21:49] <+CalderGaming> ya got im on tha ropes, rock
[2:21:50] <rasamune> FU has the performance stance, yeah
[2:21:58] <my2k_> hey ty for the art retweet yesterday :D I'm so glad I caught a live stream. you guys are gems, tysm
[2:22:15] <Intersceptre> >Pat getting his GS authority strike
[2:22:56] <Intersceptre> i enjoyed iceborne when Hunting Horn had a way better wakeup than GS, hard KO and same damage
[2:23:33] <+NWR_James> B-I-G breath
[2:23:36] <Intersceptre> lots of setup mind you but way worth, better than watching a GS user flail the distancing
[2:23:47] <twoah> Waking monsters up with a triple stacked echo wave never gets old
[2:23:58] <+nershrika> wire dash
[2:24:02] <+JenovasPuppet> Water blight
[2:24:07] <Valdorick> That's just water blight, its fine
[2:24:09] <Radioactivetaco9> your stamina is wet. you can eat a nulberry or use a bunch of wiredashes
[2:24:16] <tigerfang86> waiting takes, a lot of waiting
[2:24:21] <Megafang2145> or roll around sometimes
[2:24:21] <Admiral_PopnFresh> Clap
[2:24:22] <Intersceptre> watching a noise hit for 1800 damage in world was hilarious
[2:24:24] <%grapplingwithdepression> @Radioactivetaco9 i didnt know the wiredash thing
[2:24:28] <Admiral_PopnFresh> SO CURE
[2:24:31] <%Agami23> some go away with wiredashes
[2:24:31] <Mattais88> haven't carted in a while
[2:24:32] <Admiral_PopnFresh> cute*
[2:24:40] <tanarath> You're fine
[2:24:45] <%Bane_Kaikyo> Why Paige music so quiet??
[2:24:54] <luckysteak> Just upgrade the armor's stats
[2:25:08] <luckysteak> no armor is worth getting in low rank other than izuchi, IMO
[2:25:20] <Intersceptre> who has the hammer set in Rise?
[2:25:30] <fairore> paige you full charge that wire bird attack
[2:25:33] <Intersceptre> gimme Slugger skill
[2:25:46] <+AWr00tBear> Talk to online cat for free stuff
[2:25:56] <Intersceptre> time for item managment with Pat
[2:26:02] <fairore> can
[2:26:07] <Intersceptre> eject bottles, eject rations and food
[2:26:27] <Tonyzx15> talk to the online cat to get all your free early game stuff
[2:26:30] <Intersceptre> eject raw meat
[2:27:05] <Intersceptre> took me hours to set up like 8 different loadouts on World, but worth
[2:27:30] <Megafang2145> ok
[2:27:41] <tanarath> You do you.
[2:27:55] <+weissguard> You did great, so that's understandable.
[2:28:08] <%SuckerPunchSyd> Aww they’re matching
[2:28:11] <BlueSpartan119> also the cat next to the hub questgiver is a shop too
[2:28:21] <BackflipCharm> Good to stock up when things are on sale too.
[2:28:28] <Intersceptre> >i have a lot of money she says before building armor sets
[2:28:29] <antimatter_man> Isn’t money a problem in this game
[2:28:37] <Megafang2145> no
[2:28:50] <BackflipCharm> Money's not bad once you learn how to grind it
[2:28:50] <Megafang2145> earlygame maybe but no
[2:28:53] <%Kevlar_Caviar> only if you don't know how to money farm
[2:28:55] <+D00msDayDan> @antimatter_man not until you get to super late game stuff
[2:29:02] <antimatter_man> Well we are in early game
[2:29:21] <+Logoth_> maybe its in storage
[2:29:23] <EDFscout> you auto crafted them into mega potions
[2:29:24] <BlueSpartan119> you used it all already
[2:29:26] <+AWr00tBear> DLC Cat is behind you give you free stuff
[2:29:26] <RushUnplugged> it's set on auto-craft so you already used it to make Mega-Potions
[2:29:28] <Megafang2145> auto craft
[2:29:28] <$DensityD> it auto-crafts
[2:29:29] <+notsoy> you used all your mega potions though
[2:29:30] <%Agami23> you've been using it automatically to craft mega potions
[2:29:32] <+JenovasPuppet> Auto-craft?
[2:29:35] <Intersceptre> i never like auto-craft on premium items, kinda annoying when your honey gets yoinked and you need to farm to make other items
[2:29:36] <%skrewarrior> auto craft
[2:29:37] <Mattais88> every honey you pick up upgrade a otion to mega potion
[2:29:41] <TehMud> KEKW
[2:29:42] <%AncelDeLambert> it was used to autocraft your mission potions, turn that off
[2:29:44] <+D00msDayDan> were you in the craft to inventory or craft to item box menu?
[2:29:44] <TehMud> LUL
[2:29:44] <+ThunderJim> christ!
[2:29:47] <Valdorick> Shoulda redeemed your code at the online cart to redeem yoru Hunnie
[2:29:51] <RushUnplugged> it's GOOD Paige, it's a good thing lol
[2:29:53] <tanarath> Paige, that's GOOD!
[2:30:19] <Latija> Waifu alert
[2:30:27] <+ThunderJim> big fan of that cute boat
[2:30:30] <+D00msDayDan> "white lady shows up" "oh that's a good thing?"
[2:30:32] <+GinAndRoses> potions good, megapotions GOOD
[2:30:33] <DianaTheAscian> look a white lady
[2:30:48] <%Agami23> have you seen the one from monster hunter stories?
[2:30:49] <%cade_calrayn> can you imagine Elmo meeting one of these cats?
[2:31:04] <%CopperTucker> I used cats for expeditions. Always brought dogs with me.
[2:31:10] <Megafang2145> usually cats
[2:31:37] <MidnightPacif1c> HypeJudge
[2:31:44] <+notsoy> pat should have named all the zangiefs after various FG grapplers
[2:31:46] <Intersceptre> Palico's > Doggo
[2:31:48] <%MisterRockett> I can't believe they brought this system back it was SO complicated in Generations.
[2:31:48] <BlueSpartan119> it's both
[2:31:50] <DianaTheAscian> also dogs
[2:31:50] <+ThunderJim> meowcenaries
[2:31:51] <+GinAndRoses> both
[2:31:52] <batspiderfish> it's both
[2:31:56] <fairore> its both
[2:31:57] <Megafang2145> both
[2:31:58] <+Complete_Phased> am I crazy or is the screen region off?
[2:32:00] <tanarath> meowcenaries
[2:32:09] <+Bupkis7> Both
[2:32:23] <%SophiaAmoreaVeritas> Animal economics.
[2:32:25] <TheRealNumberJ42> does pat know about the cohoot nest
[2:32:41] <antimatter_man> It is off
[2:32:44] <yukichocomilk> why do you have to mention that she's white..?
[2:32:49] <Intersceptre> Rondine the budget guildmarm
[2:32:53] <DianaTheAscian> she's very pretty
[2:32:54] <Megafang2145> she also sells traps sometimes
[2:32:54] <Admiral_PopnFresh> Portuguese traders
[2:32:56] <+Complete_Phased> berries and cream?
[2:32:57] <Latija> white
[2:32:58] <Admiral_PopnFresh> Nanban
[2:33:05] <$DensityD> get lots of scatter fish, so you can get mega barrel bombs early
[2:33:22] <+D00msDayDan> talk to the housekeeper in your room to do everything the buddy plaza does in one place
[2:33:33] <Intersceptre> Honey, Ivy, Parashroom, Thunderbug. Everything you need.
[2:34:09] <mongorific> gotta use that argussy
[2:34:43] <tigerfang86> who need that argussy ate
[2:35:09] <%grapplingwithdepression> so long chat,  may the bonks be everflowing
[2:35:11] <%SophiaAmoreaVeritas> Give me shinny, give me soft, give me warm.
[2:35:16] <%SophiaAmoreaVeritas> But in reverse.
[2:35:17] <Saltmeisterr> AND SO HAVE I
[2:35:23] <Valdorick> What, Pat and Paige have Cahoot-ies?
[2:35:26] <+bustawof> doodNuts
[2:35:27] <JackaxeAM> You can!
[2:35:28] <Megafang2145> Always good to check that out cause it may have good selling items
[2:35:29] <%Agami23> you can pet and feed them
[2:35:33] <+JenovasPuppet> Birds can't talk. Only cats can talk, duh!
[2:35:35] <temzzii> I have played this game for like 300 hours and i didnt know that
[2:35:36] <antimatter_man> Wtf I have never seen this area
[2:35:36] <+GinAndRoses> ALWAYS pet and feed your cahoot
[2:35:40] <+D00msDayDan> you can pet your cohoot with the d-pad menu
[2:35:41] <+Kiaayo> don't ask why cats can talk but not dogs or owls
[2:35:54] <+D00msDayDan> the cohoot in that nest is actually a different one, you can tell because it's not wearing anything
[2:36:01] <Intersceptre> cats are smart and figured it out
[2:36:13] <%maskofmichael> Paige will find a way to fall in that water
[2:36:47] <%Ranryu692> Death Stranding?
[2:36:51] <+JenovasPuppet> Pat is acting like such a stream sniper right now LUL

[2:38:46] <%Kevlar_Caviar> no worries, by endgame the monsters are VERY MUCH deserving of getting their asses kicked
