[0:22:12] <+badchoice5> Paige should use a shield, it's much easier

[0:22:28] <+tweedler92> So eye doctor tomorrow?
[0:22:28] <$RetroCop87> Don't let Paige's gradual improvement in Dark Souls distract you from the fact that Mr. Krabs once sold Spongebob's soul for 62 cents
[0:22:29] <+crimsonharvest> I"m doing it?? HOW CAN THIS BE?
[0:22:29] <$TeraMercier> He was telling you that you could achieve that boss
[0:22:30] <wirblewomble> It's clearly bothersome to Pat as well
[0:22:32] <$Agami23> its almost like its pats job to talk over gameplay
[0:22:32] <$SvenHolgersson> Pat almost ruined your greatest Bloodborne achievement NEVER FORGET
[0:22:33] <Djinnazz> FUGS?

[0:22:37] <FrustratedAF> @AirlineFood74 jesus saint christ its gonna be like 15 paige streams or more
[0:22:38] <cureneckbeard> I actually think this game is pretty challenging
[0:22:39] <Supathief> Has she got better from her vertigo?
[0:22:39] <%SoFarFetched> Cheer1000 Hey Paige,not sure if this was asked already but, would you ever play the DanganRonpa series and/or the Zero Time Dilemma series on stream? They are currently 80% off on Steam for those who are interested though.

[0:23:08] <+RevolverOcelot16> Yes, when Pat tells her how good she is she becomes worse. Crazy talk at work
[0:23:09] <$Brother_Coduss> use the dark sword
[0:23:11] <+bread_assassin> I want her to beat Fume Knight on her first try, and then Pat just proposes on the spot.
[0:23:13] <$TeraMercier> Fuggins does seem like a top
[0:23:14] <TurtlesAndTentacles> I meant to put yeah fuck pat...boy my random dyslexia is acting up

[0:34:10] <JojoPiero> You'll always be Big_Hairy_Stallion69 to me
[0:34:11] <$Brother_Coduss> Do they call Pat AngriestPat or Stumbo when they meet him?
[0:34:11] <%Hobojo153> But what's the name of your raccoon persona
[0:34:13] <%starotter70> How did you come up with PeachSaliva anyway?
[0:34:13] <FrustratedAF> PeachPaige Sali....va

[0:34:16] <%bluetocho13> whats Adams real name
[0:34:17] <$TeraMercier> "Nah, this bitch forgets her own name"
[0:34:18] <squirtkitten> @Ion_Laser tobiasCHAMP just in time
[0:34:18] <%king_wragles> @PeachSaliva both doesn't have an L in it Kappa
[0:34:21] <+Kataguro> Danganronpa yes. ZTD will kill Paige
[0:34:22] <%QueequegTheater> Oh yeah because DS2 isn't long enough
[0:34:23] <%Addem_Up> Furfuckertons the 3rd does the podcast with Pat right
[0:34:23] <$SweetCheeksTrap> I know you as paige
[0:34:27] <mr_slaide> Doogen grandpa.
[0:34:29] <zamzoph> playing danganronpa would take a looong time
[0:34:31] <%thatWaulfyguy> 80 percents that's basically free
[0:34:32] <%SirGO0SE> 80 big discount
[0:34:32] <%GabeSweetMan> Only the FIRST GAME.
[0:34:32] <$FrostMass22> Just don't get Ultra Despair Girls
[0:34:33] <anAngryHamster> Zero Time Dilemma is trash from beginning to end
[0:34:38] <Kuj999> Don’t play 3
[0:34:38] <+Blargimazombie> Doki Doki is free and will only take like one or two streams
[0:34:38] <+Shoozle> Zero Time Dilemma was the bad one Pat!
[0:34:39] <+BinaryForest> Does she mean Zero Escape or specifically ZTD
[0:34:39] <+badchoice5> Danganronpa is fucking GREAT
[0:34:41] <+Nikopol1717> The second one is amazing (ZTD)
[0:34:42] <%starotter70> I have mixed feelings about ZTD
[0:34:44] <%SoFarFetched> When's Fur Fuckertons the 3rd sipsipHellmo sipsipHellmo
[0:34:45] <Skatedeandre> It’s the biggest discount they’ve had
[0:34:45] <Objection_Justice> Wait 80%?! I gotta buy something!
[0:34:45] <%thatWaulfyguy> Pat explain how 80 percent off means they're paying you to play it
[0:34:46] <Lemmy_Zappa> Play the Danggit RonPaul
[0:34:46] <+KingGilbertIV> Danganronpa is amazing
[0:34:48] <hussdogrob> out of the basement window
[0:34:48] <%Hobojo153> Danganrompa is Phoenix Wright by way of Persona
[0:34:50] <$Brother_Coduss> isnt the dangan whatever the one with the evil teddybear and the murders?
[0:34:50] <%Keyd00d> only the first 2 ZE
[0:34:51] <+Blargimazombie> And it doesn't have puzzles or anything like that
[0:34:51] <shiny_prinny> so like chat basically
[0:34:51] <DesuDesuDokiDoki> >danganrompa
[0:34:53] <%GabeSweetMan> The first game of ZTD is incredible.
[0:34:54] <Kuj999> Don’t play Danganronpa 3
[0:34:54] <thetruenicster> Play the other two games first, cause Zero Time Dilemma will be super confusing otherwise
[0:34:55] <Skatedeandre> ZTD is GOOD
[0:34:56] <GohanEgret> Dumpy Roombas
[0:34:57] <%legendfather_of_giants> @Brother_Coduss yes
[0:35:02] <Run44forrest> ZERO ESCAPE PogChamp
[0:35:02] <+KillScottKill> as if Paige's first instinct wouldn't be to click on the skeleton
[0:35:03] <FrustratedAF> skeletons give paige the apatBig Kreygasm
[0:35:04] <%skm742> I don't think you'd need to convince her to click on the skeleton...
[0:35:04] <+le_master_of_le_swords> 999 is an amazing game!
[0:35:04] <+TheDullaMAN> Pat, you don't HAVE to tell her to click a skeleton.
[0:35:06] <star_feline> Dumbo Rompus
[0:35:07] <jellssssss20> DanGan though?!
[0:35:08] <+bread_assassin> Zero Time Dilemma would be a trainwreck.Danganronpa is a lot easier for her to get through.
[0:35:09] <InugamiTheHound> @PeachSaliva should Play Nekojishi its free on steam.
[0:35:10] <%Myribelle_> okay i dont think it'd be hard to get Peach to click on the skeleton though

[2:27:51] <Someperson109> don't lock on
[2:27:53] <+LuchaDePucha> you did a great job paige
[2:27:53] <juxtest> Hes tough if you haven't played a Souls game in a while
[2:27:53] <+AtlasMcCoy> You can lock onto the legs cant you
[2:27:54] <%mostundesired> Of course Pat thinks he's too tall Kappa
[2:27:54] <Fujiwara_92> Hes a 5
[2:27:55] <JDebss> easier than the first ds1 boss
[2:27:55] <NeroInfinite> Far too tall but he isn't that bad.
[2:27:56] <$connos_procrastination> make the pee noise to escape
[2:27:56] <%Finakala> If only you can lock onto his FEET
[2:27:56] <Darmarock> One of the easiest in the series
[2:27:56] <+badchoice5> If you have defense he's nothing
[2:27:56] <worldbrand> figuring out when to lock on is a big part of souls games
[2:27:56] <%legendfather_of_giants> @PeachSaliva you can target his feet
[2:27:57] <Zombrocom> That was the easiest one
[2:27:57] <+gerenago> dont lock on
[2:27:59] <BrachyZoid> koboldSmug
[2:28:00] <Run44forrest> you murdered a giant baby basically
[2:28:00] <Zebylth> just dont lock on and hes easy
[2:28:01] <suikudo> This isnt gonna be much fun if she is like this the whole game
[2:28:03] <EASrake> quite possible the easiest boss in the whole series
[2:28:03] <+Blargimazombie> Don't lock on to him
[2:28:04] <peachy996> Not as bad as Paarl
[2:28:05] <hussdogrob> It really says something that the person who most believes in Pat's made up BS is not his fans but his Significant other
[2:28:05] <+Darren716> Hes basically an easier Iron Golem
[2:28:06] <Louie_Salmon> I'm almost certain you can lock on to his feet
[2:28:07] <%Mendin> Kings Door for Big Prizes
[2:28:08] <Zombrocom> That was as easy as it will ever get
[2:28:08] <Shwepie> Someone call the Bully Hunters on Paige.
[2:28:09] <+Blargimazombie> Problem solved
[2:28:10] <+SaintSucc> jump
[2:28:13] <DandyMackeroos> Rip his face to expose attractive skeleton

[2:28:20] <@Calek> use the soul, it's free money
[2:28:21] <star_feline> perhaps...
[2:28:24] <%Finakala> Yeah Paarl is a pain in the ass to lock on with
[2:28:24] <%mostundesired> "Well yes, but no"
[2:28:26] <Objection_Justice> Lore time
[2:28:28] <Louie_Salmon> In fact I am positive you can lock onto his feet
[2:28:29] <Silly_Duckling> you can, in fact, lock on to his feet, she made it harder, but still CRUSHED IT

[2:33:02] <JDebss> Yes Mr Critic everything stinks
[2:33:02] <Fujiwara_92> Drop your menu
[2:33:02] <Niney_Who> Fashion Souls is a thing
[2:33:03] <worldbrand> DS3 is more like that
[2:33:03] <Jarvanii> so much shitty armor in ds2
[2:33:06] <%starotter70> BloodBorne is RARE
[2:33:07] <AmericanaRed> Kreygasm sucks
[2:33:07] <%ThePuddingDead> should prolly play some bb peach
[2:33:09] <%QueequegTheater> DS2 IS THE MOST FASHION ARE YOU INSANE
[2:33:10] <+Blargimazombie> @PeachSaliva You need to give her more money for her to move
[2:33:11] <FrustratedAF> fashion souls
[2:33:13] <i_alx> DS2 IS THE BEST FASHION SOULS
[2:33:14] <@Calek> there is fashion you just need more Vitality
[2:33:14] <%hellothisisxig> i want to see paige play Sekiro
[2:33:15] <%kiiiirsten> Stats are for losers
[2:33:15] <Inebriateddonut> DS3 is more like BB in that regard
[2:33:15] <Smaenus> Bloodborne 2 never FeelsBadMan
[2:33:16] <Louie_Salmon> Except frenzy
[2:33:16] <$SWFanatic> Artorias fashion best fashion
[2:33:16] <thebestestkevin> THERES SO MUCH FASHION

[2:33:17] <Silly_Duckling> naw, she moved
[2:33:17] <%mostundesired> Some stats mattered in Bloodborne
[2:33:18] <Dragon_Batman> The resistances were like the only good things
[2:33:20] <Hydrapissed> it aint
[2:33:20] <%DesertPenguin09> Falconer set will be the best thing until she picks up the Drangleic set
[2:33:20] <%ItsRatman> DS3 was like that too IIRC
[2:33:21] <%QueequegTheater> IT HAS MORE ARMOR THAN THE OTHER 5 GAMES COMBINED WOMAN
[2:33:24] <%Keyd00d> it was me :3
[2:33:25] <Someperson109> you just need to talk to her more
[2:33:26] <+badchoice5> You can play for fashion with medium and light armor
[2:33:26] <+doc_ock_rokc> @Conky89 ladies are thick not heavy
[2:33:28] <maharielves> youre wrong patrick
[2:33:28] <Niney_Who> @PeachSaliva Pat doesn't the Hag need more souls to be given to her for her to move?
[2:33:31] <FrustratedAF> it won't be all the way, has she even gotten enough shards?
[2:33:34] <thebestestkevin> WHAT QUEEQUEG SAID
[2:33:34] <mrvidicus> Sword power go UP.
[2:33:35] <%kiiiirsten> Dark Souls 2 is about being apatBig ugly
[2:33:36] <AmericanaRed> Kreygasm Kreygasm Kreygasm the music
[2:33:37] <ShichiNoBushi> It probably says "Here" or "I did it".
[2:33:37] <%mostundesired> @ItsRatman DS3 wasn't, but the game was so roll-heavy it might as well have been.
[2:33:40] <beefomkers> Bloodborne has the best fashion

[2:49:52] <JDebss> lol mimics are already easy as fuck to see
[2:49:53] <+LuchaDePucha> can you kick the chest to see if its a mimic?
[2:49:55] <LoliKappa> Produce is only for kings
[2:49:55] <%Sphincter_Spelunker> Show me the king's cummies
[2:49:55] <%GabeSweetMan> Thank god that shit disappeared 4ever.

[2:49:58] <Shwepie> Mimics always wake up after the first hit.
[2:50:01] <%Dazharos> I still really like DS2
[2:50:01] <Dr_Donkey_Brains> Equip the lance?
[2:50:02] <$RubberFistFight> @PeachSaliva if you unequip your weapon and PUNCH them, it works the same with much lower risk of wrecking them. It's not strike times, it's total damage amount.
[2:50:05] <%evermoore_hex> spoilers pat, let her break shit
[2:50:09] <%Keyd00d> it's true

[2:51:54] <Too_Much_Nukie> @king_wragles That's the dumbest fucking thing that people actually believe. You genuinely believe that they'd make a game out of spite just to piss people off? Waste literally hundreds of thousands of dollars just to spite fans of their previous game?
[2:51:54] <Silly_Duckling> @king_wragles oh yeah, they bought in to the "prepare to die" marketing, that's what I'm saying. They actively tried to make a cruel, difficult game and not an enjoyable one

[3:07:48] <Louie_Salmon> You should wear your turtle armor, so they can see you as one of their own
[3:07:50] <$RubberFistFight> @PeachSaliva so there's an INVISIBLE second stamina bar that kicks in when your main one depletes - it controls how long it is until you can run etc again. That's why you can't drain your stam then immediately start sprinting when it comes back. It's annoying as fuck.

[3:16:56] <Kirby_Sauce> Cheer500 Pig Bepis. I like how Max was confused as to what Akatsuki Blitzkampf was, so he watched the Friday Nights fisticuffs episode to research it. Discord is giving me issues again, and were it not 1am at my aunt's apartment, I'd be screaming like a madman. Cause I'm mad... Man... Discord stopped receiving input from my mic when i reset my cpu (it was chugging) and now it refuses to work for me. This is in addition to the screenshare audio being a ssaryn.

[3:20:52] <%FrustratedAF> BJs 4 paige
[3:20:53] <Vileosis> it's a low job
[3:20:54] <Louie_Salmon> Paige would be SO HAPPY if she saw what the turtle armor looks like on her character
[3:20:54] <Fujiwara_92> Lore blowjob
[3:21:03] <Dakuu75> if you bonfire away from Pat, when you come-back will his life/health reset? so he'd be younger, less old Pat?
[3:21:08] <%legendfather_of_giants> @PeachSaliva I blew through Giant in lik an hour, but Pursuer took me like 20 tries
[3:21:08] <Run44forrest> do it tho?
[3:21:09] <StalwartZephyr> I always thought he was the second boss
[3:21:09] <%DesertPenguin09> i thought he was the proper way to Lost Bastille
[3:21:09] <RetributionP> HE HAS A HUGE SWORD
[3:21:09] <Shion963> also unlocks a greatsword after
[3:21:09] <+badchoice5> Pursuer is no joke, and he doesn't appreciate your lack of respect Paige
[3:21:20] <patismyhero> She will struggle with Pursuer
[3:21:21] <Conky89> Dennis was a wound. The Persuer was salt in it.
[3:21:22] <Run44forrest> up?
[3:21:22] <%GabeSweetMan> DESCEND
[3:21:23] <ProRJHunter> YEYE

[3:21:32] <Hydrapissed> The Slime pit
[3:21:32] <DesuDesuDokiDoki> he want to mov here
[3:21:32] <%MightyMaxT> Reset the clock
[3:21:34] <%The_Introspector> The Woolie hole is a dank, dark, moist pit
[3:21:37] <Dr_Mooose> damn
[3:21:39] <%DesertPenguin09> He's not that hard, just a test of your knowledge of basic game mechanics and lots of HP
[3:21:40] <+IDTheftVictim> woolieOMG
[3:21:41] <%SirGO0SE> LUL
[3:21:49] <DandyMackeroos> What even
[3:21:50] <%Sunstalker> Nah, Pursuer is a joke. If Paige is less tired, she'll crush him.
[3:21:52] <Berendenn> Yay I made it to a stream
[3:21:54] <%JJCheeker> woolieYE woolieYE woolieYE
[3:22:02] <%SirGO0SE> woolieGASM
[3:22:02] <%Sphincter_Spelunker> Paige is always tired
[3:22:03] <%GabeSweetMan> As with all enemies, Ignorance is strength for Paige. The more she knows, the more she fears.
[3:22:05] <%romanticzomedy> This is a palatial estate compared to the Woolie Hole
[3:22:06] <%CaptainKarite> sbfpScared
[3:22:06] <%DesertPenguin09> it's a tired thing
[3:22:06] <+donobland> the gaping woolie hole
[3:22:08] <Carbonwater> @Berendenn yo, same
[3:22:10] <+Virokwet> yay
[3:22:11] <bluefooddye1> Not really tho
[3:22:12] <%QueequegTheater> There's a trick if you learn his easy parry timings
[3:22:13] <Silly_Duckling> Pursuer has a real problem with people who walk to his left, like a crippling problem, poor guy
[3:22:13] <%hellothisisxig> paige can beat this game no problem once she gets the hang of it.
[3:22:17] <Conky89> Got to love it when a PC freezes up. Well at least an ad that has no trouble playing didn't appear.
[3:22:17] <%The_Introspector> Pursuer also teaches you that some weapons just suck in this game and you should just use big weapons or maces
[3:22:19] <Louie_Salmon> Chat has Paige equipped the turtle armor yet? She got it as a drop earlier this stream
[3:22:20] <Vileosis> @berendenn it's ending LUL

[3:22:47] <Louie_Salmon> @a_mad_dragon They can be
[3:22:49] <%QueequegTheater> IS LUCATIEL THE PURSUER? THAT'S JUST A THEORY. A GAME THEORY
[3:22:50] <+w4rhe4rt_> ur poorly textured
[3:22:53] <$Bt_Robot> Shadow puzzles
[3:22:56] <OkoPoko> It's water that looks like oil
[3:23:02] <TwinBat> ANGER ACHE
[3:23:08] <+bread_assassin> This is making me want to replay the game,but my favorite weapons are like 70% through the game.
[3:23:09] <CeeDee__> but why so mad tho
[3:23:09] <JDebss> headaches are not funny
[3:23:12] <Conky89> Blood pressure...rising
[3:23:14] <CatmanIX> just tuned in, what i miss?
[3:23:17] <%SoFarFetched> swiper no swiping
[3:23:20] <Louie_Salmon> Chat please has she equipped the turtle power yet I have to see the big dumb turtle shell
[3:23:21] <%The_Introspector> PULL THE LEVER PAIG!
[3:23:22] <Dao_Puppy> It was the first try paige, it means very little.
[3:23:23] <dabeaminator> DS3 is great, and if you think DS2 is better then you're a diagnoseable psychopath.
[3:23:26] <+yeeyeyee> scholar sucks because it moves the best weapon to later in the game
[3:23:26] <%SirGO0SE> he swiping left on you bitch
[3:23:28] <JDebss> you're doing well Paige
[3:23:28] <%SoFarFetched> I dont think she has.

[3:23:32] <+yeeyeyee> the dragon skulll hammer
[3:23:35] <%Sphincter_Spelunker> if wishes were pennies
[3:23:35] <%legendfather_of_giants> @Louie_Salmon no, it's too heavy
[3:23:36] <%zamatermort> Don't hit chests! They break with damage done, not number of hits
[3:23:39] <+Chewygamer> You are throwing MAD shade thinking you can just waltz in and beat persuers ass.
[3:23:40] <Run44forrest> no she hasnt equipped turtle armor
[3:23:42] <a_mad_dragon> ds3 is better than ds2 but i'd still rather play ds2
[3:23:46] <EuropanLamprey> paige didn't die tonight until dennis
[3:23:48] <%adolphinwizard> Soul memory before the end
[3:23:51] <+JenovasPuppet> What kind of blowjobs have you been getting if you equate them to a swear level?
[3:23:52] <%QueequegTheater> @a_mad_dragon ALso it's not
[3:23:53] <Tampaoster> TIME FOR FIRE
[3:24:03] <Louie_Salmon> But she would be so happy if she could just see the turtle power
[3:24:03] <AirlineFood74> @PeachSaliva never dodge towards the sword arm. Always roll towards the shield side
[3:24:06] <%thatWaulfyguy> just had to do a fresh install of word and do permissions repair on my disk for god knows what reasons, what's going on in here
[3:24:07] <TikanZK> HERE IT COMES Kreygasm
[3:24:07] <%The_Introspector> Ah! Yes! The broken thief sword! The best weapon in the game only surpassed by the ladel.

[3:27:17] <%moranprime> Hey Pat, what's a good shield early on?
[3:27:17] <+Sebenoth> if she's going to face fuck she might want to shield it up eventually
[3:27:19] <%super_castle_beast> The sword is just a bad shield... DROP THE SWORD
[3:27:19] <NeroInfinite> >wasting
[3:27:20] <bsmusic> Blocking with the sword is bad

[3:27:31] <%BeefyQueefer> why
[3:27:35] <Run44forrest> FUCK THAT MACE GUY
[3:27:40] <%QueequegTheater> @moranprime You can buy a 95% shield from Maughlin for cheap
[3:27:43] <%legendfather_of_giants> @PeachSaliva the ones here don't have drops. They also respawn

[3:28:01] <%SirGO0SE> this build big and strong
[3:28:02] <a_mad_dragon> aggro him and pull him back
[3:28:03] <hussdogrob> the one thing I would have loved too get with DS1 in retrospect is the ability to get to Gwenevere without facing Smough and Ornstein, because then you could see that they both left and what you fight are a couple illusions
[3:28:04] <+badchoice5> Paige's play style is made for shield
[3:28:09] <TheJohnulousAytch> Paige has been tricked into more Dark Souls
[3:28:10] <%Roasted_Pheasant> apatCrazyhead
[3:28:11] <gervil_etnad> weird animation there
[3:28:13] <derap41> Heide knghts attack animation is bullshit
[3:28:13] <Tampaoster> now that you are happy again, persuer time Kappa
[3:28:15] <Tucker0603> THAT SET IS THE BEST
[3:28:21] <+xBolts4Lifex> Don't the only drop their stuff on NG+?
[3:28:24] <Run44forrest> its heavy though... and you get better stuff later on
[3:28:28] <%QueequegTheater> YEAH COWARD OUT
[3:28:29] <bluefooddye1> Heide set is pretty average, but really fucking cool
[3:28:30] <ElemethSigma> nah they drop on NG
[3:28:35] <derap41> They do damage before the animation finishes its bullshit
[3:28:36] <%GabeSweetMan> LOL
[3:28:36] <Dr_Mooose> that's his home
[3:28:37] <%QueequegTheater> LUL

[3:28:38] <$DocMadfox> You will fight him on his terms, Paige
[3:28:40] <Ion_Laser> WHIFF
[3:28:41] <$RutilusMonachus> Heide set is probably one of the coolest sets in the game

[3:28:50] <+yeeyeyee> man look at this good AI design
[3:28:51] <Djinnazz> He literally had his back to you.
[3:28:52] <%SirGO0SE> you might be able to back stab him when he runs back

[3:28:59] <@Volta_Bass> FIGHT FOR YOUR CHILDREN
[3:29:00] <$RubberFistFight> @PeachSaliva they also have arrows through their eyeslots into their heads, which is why they're so erratic and hard to predict - the arrow yanks their brain-parts every time they move.
[3:29:01] <Louie_Salmon> Literally swung and made his cape sway
[3:29:03] <DesuDesuDokiDoki> CHEESE

[3:29:54] <+badchoice5> @Silly_Duckling Actually, they are REALLY easy to backstab if you are patient

Oh, and I'm making an xcom game of skeletons in loincloths, biker jackets, and porn mustaches, in your honor. Wish the calcium cavalcade luck!
