[0:06:36] <%JoshManVGH> I feel like if Paige ever poisoned someone it would be extremely accidental. In like a "I forgot peanuts could kill you" sort of way
[0:06:57] <akarchives> Does that count self-poisoning
[0:07:06] <%JoshManVGH> The worlds greatest "aww shit" assassin!
[0:07:08] <%YakumoYomi> That makes her the perfect assassin: no one would suspect that it was intentional

[0:07:21] <+Taisuru> @JoshManVGH Luckily paige seems fortunate enough to only inflict blight on her own body and not others
[0:07:27] <%graemecrackers2> Big stream
[0:07:49] <%dankjerri> Cheer1000 im sure someones asked this before, but considering your new focus on reading ridiculous prose and playing video games, have you given any thought to playing visual novels, maybe the Phoenix Wright games, at all?
[0:07:53] <lildaddybree99> ywah if paige killed someone we would all assume she made a big mistake

[0:08:13] <HeartsickRuben> PrideGive PrideGive PrideGive
[0:08:18] <+RealThiele> she played Phoenix wright but the sheer amount of talking required killed her throat too
[0:08:24] <@SoFarFetched> She did play the first phoenix wright game,but her voice would get really tired and she would too.
[0:08:28] <@SoFarFetched> so she didn't get far.
[0:08:32] <@PatStaresAt> same happened to me
[0:08:34] <@PatStaresAt> shits brutal
[0:08:48] <@SoFarFetched> Yeah especially with all the dialogue options and doing different voices nonstop,
[0:08:50] <%JoshManVGH> but what a game though
[0:08:55] <+Taisuru> @QueequegTheater What happened, I haven't heard anything
[0:09:03] <%AncelDeLambert> she should do like Joel did and plug it into text-to-speech... badly
[0:09:11] <SovPho> another reason to only stream it once
[0:09:15] <Laioken13> talking for a long time is pretty brutal
[0:09:25] <%patriotrenegade> @patstaresat I heard Activision is using the same strikebreaking company Amazon uses
[0:09:34] <SovPho> now imagine talking for 8 hours and dealing with someone else's kids
[0:09:44] <%dankjerri> thats super fair, but i just need to see her play John Cena High School at least once
[0:09:57] <+RealThiele> gotta stay hydrated while talking. having one glass of water and a monster aint gonna do shit for your throat
[0:10:03] <$Puhff> LESGOOOOOO
[0:10:05] <%patriotrenegade> I can’t remember, she played Sonic Dreams right
[0:10:08] <%dankjerri> you need a whole gallon
[0:10:13] <%AncelDeLambert> well, you need HOT drinks for your voice

[1:09:33] <SovPho> i know about the lupus
[1:09:48] <tacostarvedbeast> i like your hat mustard queen
[1:09:49] <%athuramn> brain damage is an extension of lupus
[1:10:09] <%athuramn> though it varies from person to person
[1:10:18] <mr_saturday93> it's fine
[1:10:51] <SovPho> it's really about what you "catch" while on Lupus, I thought. It runs in my family, but mostly just affects the women :\
[1:11:23] <President_Pariah> this matchmaking drives me crazy. i'm low rank killer and get either high ranks and stomped or newbies and a cakewalk...rank never improves
[1:11:47] <%peyodogo> it is a tad loud imo, defo tolerable but a bit hard to hear you both clearly under the game audio
[1:11:48] <%athuramn> I only know one other person with lupus besides Paige and they share similar difficulties but I don't really know much else
[1:11:49] <freelancebabymaker> @SovPho i think paige has also got some like general neck an back problems???

[1:15:26] <@SoFarFetched> new ones are better to do since they help give rift fragments if you're wanting the cosmetics in the current rift.

[1:18:30] <%JoshManVGH> My niece is visiting, so we'll be looking for something fun to do with mimimum exposure risk.
[1:18:40] <$AzureGale> Everybody's working for the weekend
[1:18:41] <%peyodogo> @Chumblago13 oh thats so cool!
[1:18:42] <Highimbrighton> ^_^
[1:18:45] <DrkJP520> I'm rewatching LotR after like 5 years. finished 1st one tonight. masterpiece
[1:18:48] <%peyodogo> sign language rocks
[1:18:58] <neptious> I love your tiny little hat
[1:19:00] <@StridentSong> Slam sticks, make fire!
[1:19:03] <jetstreamlove_R> @peachsaliva if you could make/bring back a McDonalds order, what would it be?
[1:19:11] <+razielhex> The bois ever take you to the "Eye of Quebec"?
[1:19:11] <freelancebabymaker> slammin some hot dogs together
[1:19:20] <@StridentSong> Way to be a bitch Bill
[1:19:20] <churropoppa> booooo
[1:19:22] <daisymaisy02> What perks are you running btw?
[1:19:23] <@SoFarFetched> WOW
[1:19:24] <mr_saturday93> I hate survivors who do that
[1:19:24] <freelancebabymaker> wondering why the fire wont start
[1:19:24] <Dementedpenguin> wtf
[1:19:25] <%moonsaber99> booooooo
[1:19:27] <%ThomasOfTroy> I love the idea/thought of camping, but I rarely enjoy the actual experience of it
[1:19:28] <Dementedpenguin> ONE hit
[1:19:29] <BackflipCharm> It's always the Bill
[1:19:29] <Chumblago13> @peyodogo my girlfriend was teaching a baby some basic sign language and my sister and I wanted to learn too
[1:19:33] <+reclaimer087> seriously i'm embarrassed for them
[1:19:38] <ohno778> what a putz
[1:19:51] <@SoFarFetched> Is that like Glomping?
[1:19:52] <@SoFarFetched> geefThink
[1:20:00] <@SoFarFetched> WOW
[1:20:03] <@StridentSong> They *really* need to make more severe penalties for DC's
[1:20:05] <+reclaimer087> dude
[1:20:05] <mr_saturday93> LUL LUL LUL
[1:20:06] <%peyodogo> @Chumblago13 hell yeah, good on you two
[1:20:07] <@SoFarFetched> OKAY HOLD ON WHATS GOING ON
[1:20:08] <@Jekado> YAY!
[1:20:08] <%kid_flashionable> I have the unfortunate ability to always get deathly sick when going camping
[1:20:09] <$SinisterBroccoli> is that camping in full glam makeup?
[1:20:11] <mr_saturday93> what cowards
[1:20:12] <@StridentSong> Because it's clear the current ones aren't stopping people
[1:20:13] <+RealThiele> theres campgrounds that have Yurts and cabins that can be a nice compromise
[1:20:25] <%kid_flashionable> so glamping is good enough for me
[1:20:30] <freelancebabymaker> @SinisterBroccoli out in the woods with the motley crue
[1:20:32] <mr_saturday93> good nurse players are worse than spirit of say
[1:20:34] <+joeyduderman> Nurse is scarier than Spirit
[1:20:42] <@Jekado> They should just do the LoL penalty you can't get into another game until the current one is complete
[1:20:43] <Wan6Saber> nurse > spirit
[1:20:47] <Chumblago13> Learning some new skills that are actually useful while im home at least feels productive
[1:21:08] <jetstreamlove_R> it's like a real horror, the game is favored for the Killers benefit
[1:21:13] <%athuramn> I love roughing it in my electric car
[1:21:14] <@commanderclaw> My family does Whitewater River Rafting, and being out on a river for 7 days away from civilization is pretty neat
[1:21:17] <%kid_flashionable> maybe one day I'll try regular camping again, maybe in a colder area, and mosquito-less
[1:21:17] <%tx_tofu> tx_tofu subscribed at Tier 2. They've subscribed for 32 months, currently on a 32 month streak! hi mom

[1:34:41] <%Sotetsu> Paige messed up the settings on her stuff? sipsipGasm
[1:34:43] <freelancebabymaker> @PeachSaliva remember that other vtuber avatar you tried to use once?
[1:34:44] <%ThomasOfTroy> So you can't wink anymore?
[1:34:50] <SovPho> i knew what i was asking
[1:34:52] <jetstreamlove_R> sounds metal as hell

[1:37:27] <%Estuko> Paige has become the Muppet :)
[1:37:35] <%Sotetsu> Nice face. fmgNICE
[1:37:43] <SovPho> oh that's where that renamon one is from
[1:37:51] <Broand> I was literally watching girldm's explanation of her setup and click right into another explanation :V
[1:37:55] <@MelBrooksKA> This is probably not the best game to have in the background when I play War Thunder, the gen noise fucks with me super hard
[1:38:15] <SovPho> I had 1080p webcam that I loaned out to my cousin, it looked *okay* but... eh.
[1:38:24] <@MelBrooksKA> No, it just makes me wonder why my plane is making that noise
[1:38:27] <%Estuko> @MelBrooksKA I tried playing dbd while watching otz/peach play dbd. That was super anti-productive lol
[1:38:31] <@Jekado> I miss gens having that weird car noise when you repair them.
[1:38:31] <$KnivesEve> a webcam is usually cheaper than a iphone too
[1:38:47] <%ospreyworks> @estuko oh my god she is a muppet

[1:39:26] <Coystick> Your Mortaltuber
[1:39:28] <%king_wragles> i'll donate to not hear 'meat tuber' again T-T
[1:39:30] <%Estuko> brain just switched to 2D body, 3D body is recharging
[1:39:34] <+RealThiele> i like that it allows people like paige to feel empowered to be able to stream more
[1:39:37] <chan_chan_revolution> Strongest buttons in vtubing. But really, it looks great, you're a natural at it
[1:39:50] <$Sphincter_Spelunker> stream sweaty
[1:39:51] <%Sotetsu> I am happy with both Vtuber and fleshtuber Paige, 'cause it's the words that matter.
[1:39:51] <freelancebabymaker> the paige must molt before the fleshtuber can return
[1:39:53] <$KnivesEve> i perfer the word meat tuber than flesh tuber
[1:39:54] <TheCoobie> Honestly, it comes down to your comfort. And that's ok
[1:39:56] <%ospreyworks> yeah, that does sound like a big perk
[1:40:05] <jetstreamlove_R> Vtuber helps dress however you want and be comfy
[1:40:10] <@SoFarFetched> geefThink I just had a game with two D/Cs right off the bat like your match earlier. I wonder what's going on.
[1:40:13] <Dementedpenguin> You're fine.
[1:40:15] <+reclaimer087> @Sotetsu dormstLove dormstLove
[1:40:19] <Darkfire346> *bearing intensifies*
[1:40:27] <%JoshManVGH> It's fine, it's like a midseason recap
[1:40:42] <asakura_ayase> Either streaming method is good
[1:40:52] <Broand> There's a one minute video clip I was watching on youtube, twas iphone as you mention
[1:41:01] <+razielhex> spoooky ghost
[1:41:01] <+rivercitydemon> Did you see Froot's reaction to Plague's Pokemon animation
[1:41:02] <%Estuko> maybe use AFK guy as bait
[1:41:03] <%Sotetsu> Last time, Paige Streams Z!
[1:41:12] <%joeyduderman> They could be poodooing
[1:41:23] <%ospreyworks> for reals, though, the vtuber setup is totally worth it for all the streams we've been getting
[1:41:31] <%Sotetsu> What is going on
[1:41:33] <%ospreyworks> I'm happy it makes you so comfortable
[1:41:34] <@SoFarFetched> LUL
[1:41:36] <$TheNewZealandStory> but why
[1:41:37] <+dante_must_die_exe> LUL
[1:41:44] <@SoFarFetched> "BUT I WANNA TRYYYY"
[1:41:45] <+dante_must_die_exe> paige did the bad thing
[1:41:46] <%maskofmichael> do you?
[1:41:47] <%Sotetsu> LUL
[1:41:50] <Darkfire346> "why do i do things?" -Paige, every day of her life
[1:41:52] <$Sphincter_Spelunker> what was the plan
[1:41:54] <SovPho> fool of a took
[1:42:02] <freelancebabymaker> i do like to actually see paige "in person" or whatever but i dont wanna make it seem like im a weirdo who fucking hates the vtuber for no real reason or is pissed that paige just wants to stream more conveniently
[1:42:33] <@SoFarFetched> "constantly in a state of "GOD DAMMIT" " yeah that checks out geefLul
[1:42:35] <%Sotetsu> Lupus is only skin deep
[1:42:45] <Darkfire346> I've heard its like a state of feeling like theres Something always wrong with your body
[1:43:12] <%joeyduderman> I had a co-worker friend who had Lupus and I would always ask her about being a Werewolf. She loved it and would play along. Hers was very much skin based too.
[1:43:14] <%Sotetsu> Pain sucks. Adds insult to injury for skin problems.
[1:43:32] <%Estuko> For me, if I have a really bad game at the start it can only get better from there (hopefully...)
[1:43:33] <@Jekado> i think he was making sure there wasn't gonna be a pallet save
[1:43:46] <atgithursdays> vtubers is easier than real tubing
[1:43:56] <%greencapps> I'm just glad to see you stream more consistently
[1:43:57] <@Jekado> pallet saves are DEVESTATING
[1:44:05] <@Jekado> TUBE TUBING!
[1:44:13] <$Sphincter_Spelunker> tubular
[1:44:24] <Darkfire346> "just take me"
[1:44:25] <freelancebabymaker> the vtuber avatars arent usually free so theres that
[1:44:31] <%TheWinged7> like if your wearing pants
[1:44:35] <TheFramedWarlock> It's basically the same except you don't really have to think about how you look on camera
[1:44:39] <%Sotetsu> Vtubing can be a lot safer, too.
[1:44:39] <+Firzenion> What kind of ears does your vtuber have?
[1:44:42] <TheFramedWarlock> Apart from the rig fucking up
[1:44:49] <%Sotetsu> @firzenion Fox ears
[1:45:05] <Broand> faux ears
[1:45:10] <Darkfire346> Is Paiges mouth tracking off or is that normal?
[1:45:11] <%Sotetsu> LUL
[1:45:15] <freelancebabymaker> i dont wanna be a psycho about things changing lol i have way better things to be a psycho about
[1:45:23] <%valcheese> valcheese subscribed at Tier 2. They've subscribed for 9 months! 9 month sub baby! freedom!!!
[1:45:40] <TheFramedWarlock> Well no, I mean you only have to worry about the rig screwing up not that it IS screwing up LUL
[1:45:46] <%maskofmichael> pobodies nerfect
[1:45:47] <Darkfire346> talk to Korone!
[1:45:51] <%cade_calrayn> Paige we didn’t come here for supreme skills, we came here for you and your antics and those balls in your ass
[1:46:17] <%Ranryu692> We're all subs in here LUL
[1:46:17] <+TopTieramisu> korone taco
[1:46:30] <%Sotetsu> I want to watch Paige play DBD with Gura. sipsipBaby
[1:46:34] <freelancebabymaker> i come here for the pain
[1:46:41] <robotoken> I just enjoy Peach's company
[1:46:43] <Darkfire346> how darte you accuse Paige of having balls!
[1:46:50] <TheFramedWarlock> We come here to see Baba ceasing to be
[1:46:54] <%Sotetsu> Not good? But you beat Bloodborne.
[1:46:59] <@Jekado> I too miss HotS
[1:47:05] <+allups> LUL
[1:47:09] <%ospreyworks> my little sis and her gf are fans
[1:47:13] <felinepoetry> #RipBaba
[1:47:18] <crunchych1ps2> hiiii you are so sweet. love the streams
[1:47:27] <freelancebabymaker> i rly wanna see you go back to bloodborne and just have a great time all over again
[1:47:34] <asakura_ayase> New game plus bloodbourne?
[1:47:37] <AVkid_> im back for lurky tashal1Lurk
[1:47:38] <Darkfire346> eh, shes alright
[1:47:44] <%Sotetsu> Maybe you can play it again when it comes to PC.
[1:47:46] <Broand> But yeah I'm big into 3d models and rigs and stuff. So the recent rise in popularity for vtubers is a win for me
[1:47:47] <adelym0> gascoigne a lil sexy no?
[1:47:48] <+TopTieramisu> gascoigne is bae
[1:47:55] <$Sphincter_Spelunker> gaskwang
[1:47:56] <TheFramedWarlock> Are you gonna do Elden Ring when it comes out ? GlitchNRG
[1:47:56] <robotoken> Play Sekiro seems more your style
[1:47:56] <%Estuko> I love Gascoigne
[1:47:57] <@Jekado> Paige is Sweet because of all the Hurty sand and honey she eats.
[1:48:05] <Broand> Gas coig knee
[1:48:05] <Darkfire346> dont you mean Gasc-ONyeh?
[1:48:08] <freelancebabymaker> you had a pretty good time with the dancer in the last ds3 stream right
[1:48:10] <+TopTieramisu> he's a sensitive guy that gets moved by music
[1:48:12] <+reclaimer087> yeah that really brought you around to the soulsborne series
[1:48:15] <%ospreyworks> that Ebrietas win tho
[1:48:17] <weissguard> GasKWANG KappaClaus LUL
[1:48:19] <President_Pariah> Bloodborne is the only one that rewards you for frantically spamming R1, lot of people like it best
[1:48:20] <Broand> gaskwan
[1:48:26] <Darkfire346> GASKWANG
[1:48:30] <%Sotetsu> Gascoigne was the first real boss you killed. fmgLOVE
[1:48:30] <%Estuko> Beating him felt so very good, like opening up true progression. a big "I CAN DO IT"
[1:48:34] <Coystick> I have 1 build left that I haven't played in Bb, SKL/Arcane, saving it for the inevitable Blupoint remaster
[1:48:36] <+RandyFistburgers> that feeling of triumph
[1:48:41] <SovPho> you became a man that day
[1:48:47] <freelancebabymaker> didnt you also beat orphan of kos on your first try?
[1:48:48] <TheFramedWarlock> The first Soulsborne boss is always the hardest
[1:49:10] <TheFramedWarlock> I got my ass blown out by Gascoigne but first tried OoK and Lady Spoilers by the end LUL
[1:49:10] <%OctaivianRex> @freelancebabymaker No she did not.
[1:49:10] <SovPho> a game literally about getting good, despite memes
[1:49:12] <%AncelDeLambert> no, she beat Enebriatus in thirty seconds flat
[1:49:16] <$Sphincter_Spelunker> say hi to the Chalice Dungeons
[1:49:19] <%CantWalkGood> whats that smell?
[1:49:20] <Coystick> Taurus Demon took me 6 months to defeat in 2012
[1:49:23] <%ThomasOfTroy> I had my sister play Bloodborne, and Gascoigne was also her moment where everything clicked
[1:49:24] <%ospreyworks> mazel tov, you have become a true gamer
[1:49:28] <%AncelDeLambert> OoK fucks everyone, but not everyone is fucked by Enebriatus
[1:49:31] <+TopTieramisu> how was your lady maria fight?
[1:49:33] <%ThomasOfTroy> Not your first or second try
[1:49:35] <%OctaivianRex> That was not your try.
[1:49:42] <freelancebabymaker> you beat ebrietas within in like a minute
[1:49:45] <@SoFarFetched> Pat had you mess with ebrietas,then said "okay come back later" and you beat it in 30 seconds
[1:49:48] <freelancebabymaker> it maybe wasnt your first try
[1:49:54] <freelancebabymaker> but you did beast on that sad girl
[1:50:04] <@Jekado> Thats a common misconception about goldfish
[1:50:04] <@SoFarFetched> cause he just wanted to show you Ebrietas for now,then said "come back later when you're more leveled up"
[1:50:04] <DrkJP520> Ebrietas was a first try after a break, iirc. but not first try overall
[1:50:05] <%AncelDeLambert> Lady of Maria was basically my "I give up" moment. I beat her, but beating her wore me out.
[1:50:06] <Coystick> Pronounced "Eb-Bry-eh-tus"
[1:50:09] <+realm_forge> Lady Maria cosplay when?
[1:50:10] <freelancebabymaker> ebrietas lol
[1:50:11] <TheFramedWarlock> For some reason the beast bosses fuck me up in Bloodborne but the human bosses are pretty easy. I managed to first try OoK but the Moon Presence destroyed me for a few hours
[1:50:13] <+reclaimer087> your next upgrade is just a goldfish that swims around your head
[1:50:16] <Dalthine> Change Vtuber to Namazu?
[1:50:17] <%ThomasOfTroy> The prostitute and her baby you murdered?
[1:50:19] <$SinisterBroccoli> I think you'd like Sekiro
[1:50:25] <%CantWalkGood> habe you seen that animated video of the bloodborne blood bank?
[1:50:32] <$SinisterBroccoli> but your wrists may not like sekiro
[1:50:40] <AVkid_> no, u smart. game dumb, all dumb, game smart, take from me, a geneus
[1:50:41] <@SoFarFetched> You have the death grip on your controllers and playing bloodborne made it more tense LUL
[1:50:48] <freelancebabymaker> and then didnt you have to redo the ludwig fight because something got messed up?
[1:50:49] <%Estuko> for me it was with the final boss o the DLC, my poor heart struggles with stress and I gotta take biiig breaks lol
[1:51:00] <Faustgesicht> OOo legion
[1:51:01] <%OctaivianRex> Yeah I remember being mad at you for damaging yourself and refusing to wear the braces.
[1:51:02] <+reclaimer087> there's a totem in there
[1:51:05] <@SoFarFetched> goodbye god pallet
[1:51:12] <freelancebabymaker> @SinisterBroccoli i think pat did say that sekirp would fuck up paiges wrists
[1:51:29] <AVkid_> lmao i fucked up what was supposed to be a fucked sentence lol. nyway no worries man
[1:51:34] <%Estuko> I LOVE legion, I got the outfit for her the day of the dead one
[1:51:35] <$Sphincter_Spelunker> sekiro is too reflex intensive
[1:51:38] <Zeif00> quite the pied piper of killers
[1:52:00] <@SoFarFetched> that was the yui that was chased off
[1:52:10] <+TopTieramisu> sekiro is very button pressy
[1:52:11] <%AncelDeLambert> Sekiro would break your hands
[1:52:14] <SovPho> i don't like sekiro as much, personally
[1:52:20] <freelancebabymaker> and even then its still like fucked hard sometimes
[1:52:28] <Coystick> What about the Demon's Souls remake?
[1:52:29] <%Lion_kun> You can try it for an hour and see how you do?
[1:52:31] <TheFramedWarlock> Sekiro's my favourite BibleThump
[1:52:35] <+realm_forge> Any plans to play ratchet and clank?
[1:52:43] <%AncelDeLambert> I KNEW I wouldn't like Sekiro, I knew it wasn't for me, but then I had a horrible fever and bought it on launch because I was too sick to stop myself LUL
[1:52:52] <%JoshManVGH> Aren't there mods for the PC version to make it more accessible?
[1:53:00] <%ospreyworks> I'm hoping the rumors of PC Bloodborne with new content are true
[1:53:01] <%Ranryu692> sloths aren't real
[1:53:23] <%Estuko> they add a color blind update, makes me happy to not be increibly blind
[1:53:25] <%Lion_kun> I mean you don't need great reflexes. You can just mash the block button most of the time.
[1:53:27] <@SoFarFetched> theres always some bloodborne PC rumor
[1:53:29] <@SoFarFetched> is the problem
[1:53:38] <%AncelDeLambert> I was so sick on the launch of Sekiro I lost like ten pounds
[1:53:44] <@SoFarFetched> like how the past few years we've been getting "RUMORS OF BLOODBORNE COMING TO PC" and we get nothing
[1:53:45] <freelancebabymaker> there is always a bloodborne pc rumor
[1:53:47] <TheFramedWarlock> There are mods to make it more accessible but sadly they REALLY change the game
[1:53:53] <freelancebabymaker> and there is always a new silent hill rumor
[1:54:05] <@SoFarFetched> at this point with bloodborne,don't believe rumors and wait for actual facts.
[1:54:08] <%ospreyworks> @sofarfetched I neeeeed to believe
[1:54:08] <%athuramn> imo you might have the worst sense of direction I've seen in a person but at the same time, some of the dark souls playthrough really showed off the fact that you have great spacing and reaction speeds when you know what you're getting into
[1:54:14] <%AncelDeLambert> considering how FUCKED the game is, that's probably not an issue
[1:54:18] <$KnivesEve> Bloodborne pc is just like the switch pro, a fantasy
[1:54:19] <%ospreyworks> same with a pc p5 royal port
[1:54:20] <%AncelDeLambert> Sekiro is masochistic
[1:54:24] <@Jekado> @SoFarFetched but switch pro tho... geefBlank
[1:54:27] <@SoFarFetched> Remember when people kept talking rumors about the "switch pro" geefBruh
[1:54:27] <%Estuko> I'm tired of Silent Hill rumors... I just turn on my psp and pay the 1st one lol
[1:54:32] <freelancebabymaker> its like being a silent hill fan lol
[1:54:38] <$Sphincter_Spelunker> bayo 3 will come out before bloodborne 1 port
[1:54:42] <@SoFarFetched> and it was just "NEW SWITCH WITH OLED"
[1:54:49] <%AncelDeLambert> @SoFarFetched yes, I remember Saved Ya A Click Vidya
[1:54:49] <@Jekado> Whens switch pro with bloodborne 2 on it?
[1:54:51] <TheFramedWarlock> Sekiro's not that difficult, but it's very reflex and rhythm intensive
[1:55:01] <freelancebabymaker> the best silent hill content in like 12 years was the dlc for THIS GAME
[1:55:08] <+BurningSpaceManTV> @BurningSpaceManTV is new here. Say hello! SeemsGood
[1:55:17] <%Captainahab_37> is the sound messed up?
[1:55:20] <%ospreyworks> okay, but what was with the pics that reedus took with robbie the rabbit tho
[1:55:25] <%Lion_kun> Sekiro is mostly hard because it punishes the passivity of Souls players. Paige's unga bunga style might be more suited for it.
[1:55:29] <TheFramedWarlock> Like you know the moments in Souls when bosses do a bunch of attacks and Paige freaks out ? That's basically the entire moveset of all the bosses in Sekiro
[1:55:30] <%Captainahab_37> or am I the insane
[1:55:31] <%king_wragles> Paige you have exhaustion
[1:55:31] <chan_chan_revolution> Cunt bomb
[1:55:32] <weissguard> @SoFarFetched Well it was professionally made? geefSmugAF
[1:55:34] <+reclaimer087> LUL
[1:55:35] <@Jekado> its legion he has to move on
[1:55:35] <AVkid_> nah he a cunt
[1:55:37] <freelancebabymaker> uwu chase me
[1:55:49] <%ospreyworks> I'm resigned to SH being dead and buried, but the universe keeps teasing
[1:55:53] <@SoFarFetched> @Captainahab_37 try a refresh and see if that helps
[1:55:54] <%Captainahab_37> the byebye man?
[1:55:58] <TheFramedWarlock> The Peepee Poopoo Man in DBD when
[1:56:01] <%Dalthine> Dalthine subscribed with Prime. 
[1:56:11] <$AzureGale> Despite all my rage, I'm still a rat stuck in a cage
[1:56:15] <%Captainahab_37> @sofarfetched I think it was just the music tbh
[1:56:17] <%JoshManVGH> If they stopped making games that try to melt the switch, people would have been less inclined to buy into Swtch Pro rumors.
[1:56:18] <TheCoobie> Blessed heal party
[1:56:23] <freelancebabymaker> @ospreyworks conflictedly wanting remakes of the classic games but also just wanting it to fully die and for new stuff to get made
[1:56:35] <%ospreyworks> @freelancebabymaker precisely
[1:56:49] <AVkid_> the talk of rubbing booty has awoken me, off for a beer, brb to unlurk owldamKyubey feetfeetTongue1 feetfeetTongue2 feetfeetTongue3 feetfeetDrink tashal1Happy
[1:56:55] <%Estuko> I like to use Lisa Garland (sh nurse) with med kit a a little cosplay actual nurse role sometimes lol
[1:57:00] <%ospreyworks> I'd kill to see Kojima take another cracking at horror and I don't care if it's silent hill or pt
[1:57:08] <$SinisterBroccoli> how exactly do you "win" a match?
[1:57:09] <%king_wragles> stop leaving the gen
[1:57:10] <@SoFarFetched> welp sandbagged by the nea LUL
[1:57:19] <%Estuko> noooo it was so close
[1:57:19] <%Captainahab_37> leave all the gens
[1:57:25] <weissguard> Oh shit that gens not done yet.
[1:57:33] <cooldude69xx> Everyone talking about bloodborne and sekiro and here I am, an Armored Core fan, with my thumb all the way up my ass
[1:57:42] <%Captainahab_37> give up on all the gens, embrace the give up
[1:57:42] <freelancebabymaker> @ospreyworks downpour was kind of a step in the right direction id say but it sucks that its still the most recent one
[1:57:44] <@Jekado> @cooldude69xx Armored core is dead.
[1:57:49] <@SoFarFetched> yeah looks like that yui is waiting to finish the gen
[1:57:58] <HotSauceFiend> unless he's using specific items
[1:58:02] <@Jekado> poor poor armored core.
[1:58:04] <enby_goth> I followed and I think you voice is calming
[1:58:07] <%AncelDeLambert> "Win" is not really a functional word for this game
[1:58:14] <cooldude69xx> @cooldude69xx It's so dead and I'm sad about it
[1:58:16] <freelancebabymaker> @ospreyworks also yeah i still wanna see a full on kojima horror game
[1:58:16] <bigboy3d> don't get hooked up on those killers
[1:58:19] <%AncelDeLambert> you "play" this game, but you can't really "win" it
[1:58:20] <%JoshManVGH> But Daemon X Machina was cool.
[1:58:24] <%Estuko> @cooldude69xx *stares at old ThrustMaster flightstick* :(
[1:58:27] <@Jekado> Now that Fromsoft is reduced to the pokemon company but for souls games.
[1:58:28] <freelancebabymaker> i think hed be more suited to it than some people would think
[1:58:40] <$Sphincter_Spelunker> thrustmaster huh
[1:58:42] <@Jekado> Hey mechwarrior 5 is... okay
[1:58:44] <%king_wragles> Ya it's the game audio
[1:58:47] <%ospreyworks> @freelancebabymaker I'm cool with letting th SH franchise go. 1-3 are loved and thanks to fans, the sh2 enhanced edition has preserved the game beautifully
[1:58:52] <chan_chan_revolution> What a strong regular person.
[1:58:53] <cs0402196> The switch kinda freaks out when your switching pokemon manually on Pokemon Unite, instead of pressing X and having a static menu pop up and picking from there is much faster than manually scrolling left and right.
[1:59:04] <TheFramedWarlock> @cooldude69xx Well there is Daemon X Machina
[1:59:08] <@SoFarFetched> boy that hook is a farming hook LUL
[1:59:11] <TheFramedWarlock> cottontailAwkward
[1:59:21] <@Jekado> DxM had a weird story for sure.
[1:59:21] <Faustgesicht> Hey they getting hook
[1:59:23] <+lynlyn_ow> how is that gen still not done
[1:59:32] <@Jekado> its also not a super AC game
[1:59:33] <@SoFarFetched> Because when the killer kicks the gen,it starts regressing
[1:59:40] <freelancebabymaker> @ospreyworks thats true but good versions of 2 and 3 are just like borderline inaccesible and i wish there was a simple solution to that
[1:59:43] <%TheWinged7> are you asking Pat or Geif?
[1:59:44] <+polothegreatest> OhMyDog OhMyDog OhMyDog
[1:59:44] <cooldude69xx> @TheFramedWarlock Does DxM run well?
[1:59:47] <%BlackStarAura> psaDogchamp psaDogchamp psaDogchamp
[1:59:50] <+lynlyn_ow> yea i know but it was like literally 99 when paige left it
[1:59:51] <@SoFarFetched> so the longer you don't fix it,the longer it regresses losing progress
[1:59:51] <HotSauceFiend> Is plague in this stream aswell?
[1:59:51] <TheFramedWarlock> Yeah it does
[1:59:58] <+lynlyn_ow> and the killer was chasing someone else the whole time
[2:00:05] <+lynlyn_ow> it literally needed 1 nano sec of touching
[2:00:07] <+notkojima> ah ol' leg lickin' pat back at it again
[2:00:30] <%Estuko> Maybe they're going for points from chases?
[2:00:31] <HotSauceFiend> sometimes a nice killer will let people live to farm points off them
[2:00:33] <@SoFarFetched> @lynlyn_ow Yui was being very cautious on touching the gen because of the nancy and nea being near the killer. I assume around that time legion kicked the generator while one of them was down.
[2:00:35] <chan_chan_revolution> This game seems like it'd be really easy to be toxic in
[2:00:36] <%cade_calrayn> Zangief: I LEARNED IT FROM YOU MOM AND DAS
[2:00:43] <%cade_calrayn> *DAD lol
[2:01:00] <HotSauceFiend> @chan_chan_revolution It can be extremely toxic if you meet the wrongkiller and survivors
[2:01:05] <HotSauceFiend> most of them are good though
[2:01:12] <imagine_being_cringe> alalalalallala
[2:01:14] <Talen99> It is incredibly easy to be toxic in, the entire thing is built on a system of power tripping and smugness
[2:01:19] <%Estuko> the problem is the toxic ones are disgustingly toxic :(
[2:01:36] <MagikarpFestival> sipsipElmo
[2:01:48] <@SoFarFetched> NOED CHECK
[2:01:48] <@SoFarFetched> geefO
[2:01:51] <%ospreyworks> my friend's toddler is like a bulldog with opposable thumbs
[2:02:05] <+Soliloquy123> If killers use the Frosty Eyes cosmetic, 100% chance they run NOED
[2:02:06] <HotSauceFiend> But it goes both ways, both survivors and killers can be toxic to each other
[2:02:09] <$Sphincter_Spelunker> @ospreyworks do they feed it out of a bowl?
[2:02:25] <+Thesaltt> The worst thing for me is when the survivors wait at the gate and wait for you to show up to run away. It's like they're saying, "Hey killer! Watch me win!"
[2:02:30] <@SoFarFetched> nice NOED is gone
[2:02:30] <cs0402196> What's NOED?
[2:02:49] <%joeyduderman> flashlight shenanigans too
[2:02:57] <@SoFarFetched> No One Escapes Death = a hex totem activates on a dull totem and everyone can be downed in one hit until the totem is gone.
[2:03:07] <%Estuko> lol so mean
[2:03:08] <%ospreyworks> @sphincter_spelunker hahahaah, nah, but my god she has so much energy
[2:03:19] <HotSauceFiend> the flashbang stuff is great though
[2:03:24] <@SoFarFetched> So if you're at full health,you can be downed in one hit with NOED
[2:03:25] <%Estuko> ever got really good points there though
[2:03:38] <Talen99> "I mean there's not much a survivor can do except this thing I guess." Proceeds to happen on stream KEK
[2:03:40] <%ospreyworks> @sphincter_spelunker and she knows a bit of sign language, so watching her sign for "more" is the coolest thing
[2:03:47] <%BlowFireThroatTotem> I don't understand teabagging. it counts as teabagging if you're not like, on top of somebody?
[2:03:55] <+Mekhet09> You have 800k points why do you need more?
[2:03:58] <$Sphincter_Spelunker> @ospreyworks aw that's cute
[2:04:02] <%joeyduderman> Jane!
[2:04:04] <%joeyduderman> Bill?
[2:04:12] <@SoFarFetched> @Mekhet09 this game is VERY grindy
[2:04:13] <+polothegreatest> Bill?
[2:04:20] <%joeyduderman> JILL VALENTINE!
[2:04:22] <%king_wragles> As a killer main (eye roll) NOED isn't actually good. It only helps when you've done bad enough to make it to Collapse. It's a trap
[2:04:23] <%Estuko> Bill has really good stuff, I am (very slowly) getting blood points for him
[2:04:25] <+polothegreatest> 0.0
[2:04:29] <%joeyduderman> her perks are super dope
[2:04:29] <%ThomasOfTroy> "Why do you need more" Because I haven't hit the cap yet
[2:04:35] <@SoFarFetched> Yeah I will help
[2:04:35] <%Estuko> waoooh that Bill is awesome
[2:04:41] <President_Pariah> FYI it'll take like 1 mil to level a character from 1 to ~40
[2:04:45] <@SoFarFetched> If you want to VC Im down
[2:04:45] <%ospreyworks> did they ever fix the claire skin for jill?
[2:04:50] <Zeif00> Another power duo
[2:04:55] <@MelBrooksKA> @SoFarFetched Don't fuck up
[2:04:56] <%ospreyworks> she looked a bit off
[2:05:07] <%hewlettfan96> whats your fitness level?
[2:05:18] <%BlowFireThroatTotem> eating cold chef boyardee straight out of the can counts as fitness, I'm pretty sure
[2:05:30] <+lynlyn_ow> omg they broke jill's face
[2:05:31] <cs0402196> What skin was it that had the super fugged face?
[2:05:35] <SovPho> like astronaut condom sizes
[2:05:43] <+polothegreatest> HUUUUGEEEE
[2:05:53] <Faustgesicht> they in fact stung jill's face with bees. Candyman spoiler?
[2:06:00] <%cade_calrayn> The way you said “fitness” made me imagine your vtuber dancing to Fergalicious, Paige
[2:06:00] <+realm_forge> Paige will be ginger she ra
[2:06:02] <%ospreyworks> do you have a trainer, peach?
[2:06:07] <@SoFarFetched> did you want VC Paige? geefBush

[2:06:27] <TheDewdHole> PEACH IS ANIME NOW?!
[2:06:27] <+toolofparanoia> I hope they add candyman as a killer
[2:06:45] <@MelBrooksKA> Jesus, it's almost next weekend
[2:06:47] <%BlowFireThroatTotem> Candyman is a great flick
[2:06:52] <$Sphincter_Spelunker> then you can only blame the ADD once you have glasses
[2:06:53] <%BlowFireThroatTotem> the first one at least
[2:07:00] <atgithursdays> be my victim
[2:07:01] <%BlowFireThroatTotem> I'd recommend it to people who aren't even into war
[2:07:06] <%Lion_kun> When she gets her car, she will come up with another excuse:P
[2:07:09] <%BlowFireThroatTotem> *horror
[2:07:10] <Zeif00> Just call her LUL
[2:07:10] <%Estuko> candy man as killer would be very coool and scary, I still secretly hope for Crypto from Destroy All Humans... lol

[2:20:30] <@Jekado> doesn't the map tell you where hatch is?
[2:20:42] <%Sotetsu> Victor always looks the same. It's a shame.
[2:20:44] <%king_wragles> @Jekado Only if you have the add-on to track it
[2:20:50] <%king_wragles> OR, if it's a red map
[2:20:53] <HotSauceFiend> the hatch doesnt show up unless specific conditions are met
[2:21:03] <HotSauceFiend> like less number of player than there are gens
[2:21:04] <@MelBrooksKA> Unbeatoffable
[2:21:06] <%king_wragles> No he meant like tracking through the map, not hatch spawn itself

[2:38:14] <Uselesswhitenoise> im not
[2:38:26] <President_Pariah> prolly just cause it's not Dark Souls, chat gets frustrated during games like that
[2:38:40] <+Thesaltt> It'sm very exciting to see someone who was a somewhat bigger streamer who streamed traditionally become a Vtuber. It's awesome!
[2:38:52] <%ospreyworks> Peach, have you ever done a reading of a Chuck Tingle work on stream?
[2:39:05] <$AzureGale> I regret to inform you that your favorite TV show has been canceled
[2:39:19] <cs0402196> It's so rare that explosions happen that you legit scared me.
[2:39:21] <rudiciuscaesar> Idk, I feel Dark Souls, yeah, but I remember back in Bloodborne, there was no frustration. At least out of me, that was continuously impressive.
[2:39:30] <Kingjoker310> your model its too fucking cute paige i love it i just want to give you a big ol bear hug
[2:39:41] <leinadtonu> Although according to quantum immortality, you just jump to the next timeline where you don't die...

[2:41:47] <TheFramedWarlock> I'm getting a diagnosis next week !
[2:42:04] <cs0402196> Ifthe theory of Quantum Immortality is real, then when you've whiddled down every other life, every life you've ever lived has become one, but because your so old, you aren't all powerful.
[2:42:05] <leinadtonu> Wish I had ADHD... I'm just dumb lol

[2:42:51] <%peyodogo> look sometimes there's nothing up in your dome and thats okay
[2:42:52] <@Jekado> the other person also has 2 hooks
[2:42:53] <rudiciuscaesar> I have been told it's the opposite of OCD, but my horrible ex-wife's middle daughter has it, and idk, she's all over the place.
[2:43:02] <SovPho> Man, I took Adderall exactly one time with ADHD and was like "Holy shit, is this how normal people feel?"
[2:43:08] <Kingjoker310> having both gives more power bitterLOL
[2:43:10] <Hasemeow> Anyone else have organized messes
[2:43:10] <shyrstyne> i thought i was dumb turned out it was adhd

[2:43:25] <@Jekado> Lets see if this bird can find all chickens before they HATCH
[2:43:25] <rudiciuscaesar> organized mess, yes, am an artist, all things in my life are a mess.

[2:46:39] <rudiciuscaesar> is that a denim top?
[2:46:46] <Faustgesicht> Is Felix a good survivor?
[2:46:59] <+InhumanMilitia> pat in a booster seat
[2:47:11] <TheFramedWarlock> Make Pat's model just a Canadian head from South Park
[2:47:15] <rudiciuscaesar> Pat could just be a Tonberry, if that's not a potential copyright lawsuit...
[2:47:17] <Kingjoker310> yeah true but still tho
[2:47:19] <%LysdexicAndVolingit> I stil llike the Pat-Toilet vtuber idea
[2:47:20] <leinadtonu> orby thots
[2:47:24] <AVkid_> i like pat just being some guy saying "fuck you here's me" lol
[2:47:54] <+DeadlyPeaks> Vtube pat would be cool, but I’d miss the babies
[2:48:11] <Kingjoker310> but its all up to pat if he wants to do it in the end
[2:48:18] <rudiciuscaesar> @TheFramedWarlock Jesus, that's on point, that's the best, I agree with that fully.
[2:48:21] <leinadtonu> Pat's avatar would be a picture of pat doing like the "Dame da ne" meme
[2:48:27] <boomstickery> its jsut a pic of pat but south park canadian
[2:48:32] <Kingjoker310> pppffff
[2:48:47] <Hasemeow> aaa sad paige

[2:48:56] <Hasemeow> the ear game too strong holy hell
[2:49:19] <cs0402196> Is it possible to make a program that makes the babies pop-up as little hats for you when the get registered for your model?
[2:49:20] <rudiciuscaesar> wait, does the vtube have fangs sometimes?
[2:49:45] <Kingjoker310> how hard was it to setup everything up ? @PeachSaliva
[2:50:03] <megumoon500> what about a reskin of that one guy from aqua team hunger force for pat's 2d model?
[2:50:27] <AVkid_> @rudiciuscaesar i wanna say some frames do, i think the early tweets had some fangy ness
[2:50:31] <Kingjoker310> ahhh okay
[2:50:40] <rudiciuscaesar> yeah, totally, sometimes has fangs
[2:50:48] <Kingjoker310> well yeah
[2:51:52] <@MelBrooksKA> It's been extremely rainy in Tucson
[2:51:59] <+Soliloquy123> I get migraines in bad heat and Texas is murdering me
[2:51:59] <rudiciuscaesar> Huh, I get the really bad headache from the cold. When it's super hot by me, it feels like you're walking underwater.
[2:52:09] <@MelBrooksKA> There are rivers sometimes
[2:52:18] <%kid_flashionable> @soliloquy123 saame
[2:52:30] <cs0402196> The Thots come, ghe the Thots go.
[2:52:46] <AVkid_> @soliloquy123. yeah dude, houstons 90 with heat index of 102. shiz is unbearable
[2:52:54] <%kid_flashionable> the Texas heat, but instead of migraines I get stomach pains
[2:52:55] <rudiciuscaesar> yeah!!!! look at that tweeker
[2:53:02] <HaroldDonchee> how do the glasses stay up with fox ears? my immersion is completely broken
[2:53:03] <Faustgesicht> Yeah zombie ai bad
[2:53:14] <%kid_flashionable> in Dallas it's gonna be in the 100s tomorrow with a heat index of 114, why is Texas like this
[2:53:30] <AVkid_> @kid_flashionable. good jesus
[2:53:42] <AVkid_> f
[2:53:55] <leinadtonu> @kid_flashionable How much is that in Celsius?
[2:53:57] <%kid_flashionable> I hope the expected heat index will be lower honestly
[2:54:09] <%king_wragles> @kid_flashionable past boiling
[2:54:17] <@Jekado> WHY
[2:54:21] <leinadtonu> Jesus
[2:54:27] <rudiciuscaesar> nah, I think that was a valid attempt
[2:54:33] <AVkid_> noo lol 1 sec. @leinadtonu
[2:54:44] <megumoon500> this is the first summer in texas that i've got sun burn
[2:54:46] <%kid_flashionable> around 45 Celsius
[2:54:47] <%king_wragles> @leinadtonu OH, it's like 45.5
[2:54:58] <rudiciuscaesar> "what do you mean?"
[2:55:03] <Hasemeow> gotta love that triple digit temps
[2:55:06] <%king_wragles> I'm not great at math
[2:55:18] <%kid_flashionable> lmao me neither, that's why Google is there
[2:55:22] <Hasemeow> If our A/C went down id literally die
[2:55:27] <leinadtonu> sounds rough, stay safe.
[2:55:30] <AVkid_> @leinadtonu. yeah a humid 45.5
[2:55:40] <%kid_flashionable> yep, I'm very happy we fixed our ac recently
[2:55:42] <@Jekado> Ironic that Fetch is Leon and they got Nem Nems
[2:55:50] <%king_wragles> So I remembered boiling in celsius is 100, and for some reason mixed that with the boiling point in Farenheit
[2:56:05] <%kid_flashionable> God could you imagine boiling heat though?
[2:56:16] <%king_wragles> You would not be able to survive
[2:56:22] <%king_wragles> The water in the air would end up cooking you
[2:56:25] <%kid_flashionable> oh true
[2:56:38] <TheFramedWarlock> You would also just cook
[2:56:40] <rudiciuscaesar> I remember a few years back, I think like 2013, it was almost 105 in Pittsburgh and we don't have AC, most houses don't, so like, I went to Wendy's, and stayed there for like 5 hours, cuz they did.
[2:56:41] <%king_wragles> It'd have to be 212 for us
[2:56:42] <Hasemeow> iirc a town in pakistan reached like 126 Fahrenheit, was pretty crazy
[2:56:43] <%kid_flashionable> I guess I wouldn't have a choice to live in boiling heat
[2:56:48] <TheFramedWarlock> Without the water in the air
[2:56:54] <Kingjoker310> of course it would be hard to make a model but nice you got some help with the setup also again love your model looks super cute with the glasses and the lovely green eyes and its nice to see you again streaming its been awhile since i last saw your stream much love for you guys bitterSweet @PeachSaliva
[2:57:12] <%kid_flashionable> OH GOD yeah okay that's a not good hot, I forgot how high boiling temp was
[2:57:17] <AVkid_> @king_wragles dude i had an icelandic manager tell me to cook soup at 100 degrees, and we argued for five minutes before he was like " right, i mean 212" lol
[2:57:39] <AVkid_> i shoulda took the hours lol
[2:57:46] <%king_wragles> It's tough knowing two measurement systems when you're dumb
[2:57:52] <%kid_flashionable> this is why I didn't graduate with a math related major
[2:58:10] <%joeyduderman> I found out I was ADHD in 1986. I am an oldhead ADDDDDHHHRRRRRRRRRRRRR
[2:58:22] <%king_wragles> "I put it at 30, why isn't it freezing? OH ya, C. Right"
[2:58:32] <AVkid_> lol
[2:58:44] <%kid_flashionable> heheh
[2:59:19] <%king_wragles> Why is Dwight just making noise near you?

[3:00:27] <AVkid_> lovely feetfeetComfy
[3:00:33] <+spaghetti_shaman> Who is taller? Pat or Tomar/
[3:00:50] <Hasemeow> the real question, is who is taller, pat or zangief?
[3:00:58] <AVkid_> @spaghetti_shaman tomar, but just by a couple inches
[3:01:04] <@MelBrooksKA> The way FarFetch said "Thank you" reminded me of Beatles from Wind Waker
[3:01:08] <SovPho> yeah that's just... PEACHY

[3:04:17] <Kingjoker310> how did this happen cuz i got bits of the situation all i know your back is just messed the fuck up what started this whole mess
[3:04:31] <%king_wragles> Were they trying to give you an addiction?
[3:04:39] <Kingjoker310> THATS IT
[3:04:41] <%king_wragles> WAIT, is this from that one awful visit you had like 2 years ago?

[3:04:46] <AVkid_> took a 3 story spill, and lower back gets fucky. steroid/cortozone shots are a good temp, i really dunno how to fix, working like squats occasionally helped me, but maybe not universal
[3:04:47] <blue8moon> Paige is made of glass
[3:04:50] <Hasemeow> A sneeze so powerful the very ground shook
