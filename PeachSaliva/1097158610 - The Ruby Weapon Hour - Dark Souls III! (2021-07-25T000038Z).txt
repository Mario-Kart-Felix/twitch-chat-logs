[0:03:21] <SilverRoddo> Beastar stream PogChamp
[0:03:33] <Luna_Selenic> @maenos2 I'm betting she struggles on the Pontiff and blitzes through Irithyll Dungeon in one go
[0:03:42] <%Bt_Robot> @danteftw20 BUT HE WOULD GET THE MOST LAID!
[0:03:44] <+CatastropheCorvid> That's totally not it though. He said "Who would have me as a man", which more implied he was seen as a monster.

[0:05:30] <Coystick> Is Hamiltor cool at least?
[0:05:32] <KeiganOfAstora> SOLO Dark Souls 3 to be exact. This should be good
[0:05:35] <otakon17> that subtle Bone Trousle
[0:05:39] <danteftw20> you though you could escape to the stream chanel of the woman who'd bone skeletons from talking about one of the most prominent skeleton villains?

[0:07:47] <danteftw20> half skeleton half man, a skeleton man
[0:07:56] <cyclog> @patriotrenegade @@@ Kappa Kappa
[0:07:57] <otakon17> I mean aren't we ALL half skeleton?
[0:08:00] <%Ziegsy> Hey chat! the tanukis at my moms animal sanctuary had babies!
[0:08:05] <otakon17> oooh!
[0:08:12] <otakon17> wee racoon puppers
[0:08:24] <SilverRoddo> Skeletons are just pilots in a flesh mech
[0:08:27] <+Bailey__gaming> It's sad that skeleton and he man are barely in their show, that's 2021 tho
[0:08:29] <%Ziegsy> they are so small and loud
[0:08:31] <peachy996> We are all Skeletons in holiday clothing
[0:08:34] <%maenos2> do they actually got big balls like in my Japanese animes
[0:08:44] <otakon17> Skeletons just have a flesh exoskeleton?
[0:08:51] <%Ziegsy> They do, very much so. and the males will show them off if you get near their partners
[0:08:53] <otakon17> yes, tanuki do have large scrotums
[0:08:54] <$standby_for_titanfall> @ziegsy so how long til more Tanuki suits?
[0:08:56] <SilverRoddo> LUL
[0:09:02] <thelonechris> Don't tanukis have magical ballsacks or whatever?
[0:09:05] <%maenos2> oh wow I figured that was myth
[0:09:07] <%RedMageRebel> the biggest of balls
[0:09:09] <otakon17> in folklore, yes
[0:09:20] <cyclog> @Ziegsy bruh
[0:09:25] <otakon17> their testicles are normal sized for their bodies, their scrotums are what's large
[0:09:34] <jorniev> NOBODY BELIVED. BUT THE LEGENDS WERE TRUE
[0:09:37] <otakon17> XD
[0:09:38] <peachy996> I wonder if you can get your skeleton in Gold as a dying wish
[0:09:44] <+sonofthedeepsouth> But baba
[0:09:45] <+Etherealizer> tanuki balls are weapons of mass destruction
[0:09:47] <+Bailey__gaming> I like to think that Pom Poko is a documentary
[0:09:50] <otakon17> Gold Skeleton but a stand
[0:09:56] <otakon17> Pom Poko is a great movie
[0:10:03] <user_naim> Baba is Through
[0:10:03] <otakon17> love me some Ghibli films
[0:10:10] <otakon17> Baba is Skeleton?
[0:10:11] <user_naim> Sheep bastard
[0:10:15] <%maenos2> when my father died we had the option of donating his skeleton to the university hospital he was cared at
[0:10:23] <otakon17> did you go for it?
[0:10:32] <otakon17> that's kind of a noble thing I think
[0:10:33] <peachy996> I would like to be dipped in Gold. Covered in Jewels
[0:10:33] <+Bailey__gaming> and they get up to shinnaniganx
[0:10:48] <otakon17> dedicating your remains to the advancement of science and teaching
[0:10:49] <peachy996> I want to be as tacky in death as possible
[0:10:59] <otakon17> My mom wants to be dolled up like a clown
[0:10:59] <%maenos2> that was one option, other was cadaver study and came with a free cremation
[0:11:08] <%maenos2> we went eith the latter
[0:11:08] <Kroaat_> whoever knows where this song is from is a god
[0:11:15] <%BogBodyPositive> BogBodyPositive gifted a Tier 1 sub to PinkertonDanPie! This is their first Gift Sub in the channel! 
[0:11:22] <otakon17> it's a remix of Bone Trousle from UNDERTALE
[0:11:26] <+Bailey__gaming> I kinda wanna be shot into space like they do in star trek
[0:11:27] <%maenos2> brain study especially due to his passing was useful for dementia info
[0:11:28] <Kroaat_> WRONG
[0:11:28] <@SoFarFetched> Well Paige told us earlier Mew Mew's Theme
[0:11:29] <%RedMageRebel> if I can't get shot into space I wanna be buried in a natural cemetery. just a linen sheet; they have one near where I grew up and the cost of the funeral goes to buying more land and its set up as a park in perpetuity
[0:11:31] <@SoFarFetched> geefTux
[0:11:40] <otakon17> oh wait you're right
[0:11:41] <Kroaat_> its spider dance
[0:11:42] <%patriotrenegade> Tokyo Mew Mew?
[0:11:46] <%RedMageRebel> so it'll always be a natural space no matter how built up things get
[0:11:46] <otakon17> I'm sorry it's Spider Dance remix
[0:11:47] <%BogBodyPositive> @RedMageRebel I love natural burials
[0:11:55] <Kroaat_> you were on the right track otakon
[0:11:58] <%BogBodyPositive> idk if you can tell by my username lol
[0:12:03] <+sonofthedeepsouth> Start the stream before I piss meself!
[0:12:09] <Kroaat_> good you recognized its from ut
[0:12:14] <@SoFarFetched> Bruh Paige literally said "mew mew's theme"
[0:12:14] <otakon17> well I mean the Undertale boss themes all share the same basic "structure"
[0:12:17] <%patriotrenegade> When I die I want to be scattered at Disney Land. I also don't want to be cremated
[0:12:19] <%maenos2> btw word of advice if you ever spread human ashes - use gloves.
[0:12:19] <cyclog> I want a C4 burial. Let's see how much shrapnel I can produce.
[0:12:20] <Kroaat_> true ngl
[0:12:44] <otakon17> I don't think you can blow your corpse up
[0:12:49] <otakon17> because that's a biohazard
[0:12:50] <Kroaat_> all of ut's ost links back to spider dance
[0:12:51] <%Grimlockfly> Cheer200
[0:12:58] <%maenos2> well the MAN says so
[0:12:58] <cyclog> @otakon17 well not with that attitude.
[0:12:58] <rekinom> Shoot me into the sun pls
[0:13:01] <otakon17> let's do a YT search
[0:13:19] <+sonofthedeepsouth> fly me to the moon and let me shitpost among the stars
[0:13:32] <$Doctor_Death_Bed> Oh man it's been a hot minute ey?
[0:13:37] <@SoFarFetched> Im pretty sure this is the song Paige is using https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gT5bsym1Cug
[0:13:37] <%BogBodyPositive> dump me at a senator's house
[0:13:45] <+Bailey__gaming> flying through the universe in a coffin to maybe done day scare the bejebus out of an Ayy is what i want
[0:14:19] <otakon17> thanks @SoFarFetched
[0:14:19] <bakkatohri> The Ayy Lmaos left Earth because Humanity is frigid
[0:14:24] <%RedMageRebel> actually wait, do the meme where they tie your body to a ceiling fan and have it spin around as the space jam song blasts into the funeral home
[0:14:38] <%maenos2> ...the fuck meme is that
[0:14:46] <otakon17> NO WONDER IT GAVE ME MAD DUMMY VIBES

[1:02:20] <%Ranryu692> now THAT is how you get pink eye
[1:02:22] <rekinom> Anyone ever been in their basement and then have one of those house centipedes scuttle across your bare foot and then you just have to move
[1:02:33] <+AEUG_Ace_Kamille> Imagine getting chomped in half by a horrible centipede lady and being like "It's fine."
[1:02:34] <%JenovasPuppet> There are hopefully NOT ashes here.

[1:03:54] <ToneBacas> are your headphones turned on?
[1:03:54] <%Grimlockfly> it might be because you are a discord call?

[1:03:54] <Helix_Snake> put the headphones on your fox ears instead of your human ears
[1:03:56] <%Rumbutt> is it because of the discord call?
[1:03:56] <+thatgirlpossessed> We can hear splashing

[1:05:37] <+FennecZephyr> @PeachSaliva That sounds like an issue you can toggle with a settings menu
[1:05:39] <%athuramn> if you have communications to drop volume when you or someone talks is a windows setting
[1:05:44] <pabloelenano2> in discord

[1:07:08] <%OctaivianRex> Remember when Paige lowered the graphic quality to fix the FOV. Good times.
[1:07:19] <%JenovasPuppet> vtuber Pat is just in a Geek Squad shirt.

[1:08:58] <freelancebabymaker> oh man these streams make my stomach hurt
[1:08:59] <%OctaivianRex> Paige plays the role of the BACKPACK. Everyone carries her around.
[1:09:00] <assailantlf> Pat's audio is a bit low compared to Paige
[1:09:02] <Lone_Xeno> Yes... the ASHES. that's the only reason we are in here
[1:09:02] <+AEUG_Ace_Kamille> She's trying.
[1:09:02] <peachy996> There is no I in Paige. ...Wait a minute
[1:09:03] <@PatStaresAt> She's using her dedicated rig
[1:09:07] <Sir_Gawain_Lotsson> Fucked up settings like Motion Blur: ON. FOV: 30. HDR: ON with NON-COMPLIANT MONITOR. Anti-aliasing: OFF.
[1:09:10] <+Grayhammatter> poopoo ashes
[1:09:12] <%king_wragles> Okay, so stream dying is JUST on my end right?

[1:10:21] <+Epic_Fubar> please go back to onion man
[1:10:24] <%JenovasPuppet> He was snoring before lol
[1:10:26] <KeiganOfAstora> NPC's have multiple dialogue lines. You should be used to that
[1:10:27] <ToneBacas> sleeping is a dialogue
[1:10:33] <mr_saturday93> paige dum
[1:10:34] <%Rumbutt> yeah so you talk again paige
[1:10:37] <Lone_Xeno> Its THE LAW
[1:10:45] <Wiiplayah43> You always talk to people multiple times in these games
[1:10:46] <assailantlf> kinda bad game design, because the dialog box is so transparent with no dialog
[1:10:49] <gryffinp> to be fair to paige they probably should have had "zzzz" subtitles or something instead of just blank nothingtitles
[1:10:51] <+AmanisHouseOfNonsense> Yeah, Onion Man's the coolest
[1:10:55] <%patriotrenegade> USELESS
[1:10:55] <%Rumbutt> mash talk, spam talk, talk until they start saying the same damn shit
[1:10:57] <%Lion_kun> something you will never use

[1:11:25] <rekinom> It's booze made from his pee
[1:11:25] <%peyodogo> i wonder if estus is like a kind of pumpkin
[1:11:30] <+GinAndRoses> onion beer
[1:11:30] <postmortempc> Ever wonder the ingredients to the soup?
[1:11:31] <%king_wragles> His families bear, according to direct translation
[1:11:31] <a_mad_dragon_> booze soup
[1:11:33] <%athuramn> isn't it really messed up that there's a soup made out of estus
[1:11:35] <Sir_Gawain_Lotsson> LONG MAY THE SUN SHINE!
[1:11:35] <Lone_Xeno> Long may the sun shine!!
[1:11:36] <+FackinCrazy> I imagine estus tastes like creamsicle
[1:11:40] <HotSauceFiend> how does he drink through his onion helmet

[1:12:38] <%SveriSageAdvice> I think Paige is safe, but the estus soup might have been important to leave behind for a questline, i personally havent noticed a difference but its listed as part of the Siegward quests
[1:12:38] <boomstickery> how old is this guy? he was in DS1
[1:12:39] <$FrostedZaibatsu> Man was looking at a photo of Guinevere

[1:17:44] <%Grimlockfly> gotta sovereign those souls
[1:17:45] <%JenovasPuppet> @Hydrapissed Doesn't she have until Pontif to do stuff to save him?

[1:17:53] <%SveriSageAdvice> that's how i lost Greirat
[1:17:55] <Lone_Xeno> You DID it! you murdered greirat...
[1:18:03] <KeiganOfAstora> Greirat comes back when you kill a boss. But his second trip is to Irithyll. But you're at Irithyll already so idk how that works....
[1:18:11] <chronoxgp> i don't burn shards in these games they make your healling too good
[1:18:14] <%peyodogo> nah i thought you only lose greirat when you walk past that bonfire

[1:34:40] <BinaryBetrayer> Paig should set herself on fire to get her health bar back
[1:34:41] <KeiganOfAstora> I never used that shortcut because it's so close to the boss door, you just go a little further and you have the other shortcut that's closer
[1:34:44] <+realm_forge> ‘Pat sounds like he’s on life support lol

[1:35:56] <The_Vainglory> It's uncanny how the model can capture Paige's face of bewhilderment.
[1:35:56] <$Sphincter_Spelunker> PUT YOUR MIND TO GOING TO THE EYE DOCTOR
[1:35:57] <%JenovasPuppet> Did she kill the pilgrim? It's fine if she didn't, I'm just curious.
[1:35:59] <VirtuaRailith> Is Yang still dead in ff4?
[1:36:00] <CrimsonFox777> She will beat the game through BRUTE SMARTS!
[1:36:01] <%patriotrenegade> ok, you would get lost

[1:36:28] <%JenovasPuppet> Ooooooh nooooo
[1:36:28] <Tracazoid> That really is Paige's biggest weakness, panicking. As soon as she doesn't she's a monster. Well and a sense of direction.

[1:49:22] <cyb3r_demon> the stairs
[1:49:22] <$Sphincter_Spelunker> he was at half health

[1:49:33] <VritraReiRei> Remember Paige, dont swing more than 2 times in a row
[1:49:33] <Vadrigar1994> Yeah he's a bitch and a half

[1:51:41] <+TacoSaIad> pat didn't know you could just run to the left
[1:51:42] <+waddledoops> You don’t have to go to the bad men way you can just go left as soon as you leave the front door
[1:51:43] <%patriotrenegade> @PeachSaliva Paige, you are doing your best
[1:51:44] <+CherteuseKapibara> more teas

[1:51:58] <%JenovasPuppet> @ElenaManetta Pretty sure she has to hit a button
[1:52:00] <Jaxnos> THE QUESTION FOR WATER AFTER GOLDFISH HAS TO BE PEAK COMEDY
[1:52:01] <%pokefan9956> I'm your fishbowl?
[1:52:01] <%patriotrenegade> That is a lie, goldfish have very good memories

[1:52:05] <$Sphincter_Spelunker> don't drink pee
[1:52:07] <drawerinkshow> Mythbuster show that goldfish had better memory
[1:52:07] <BoxNavy> SourPls
[1:52:11] <HotSauceFiend> Slow mode was made to combat toxic chat. chat still seems slightly toxic
[1:52:11] <OkamiDude15> @ElenaManetta most likely set to a button command
[1:52:12] <KeiganOfAstora> Does "going to pee" and "fill my water" mean the same thing? Please tell me it doesn't
[1:52:25] <%Lion_kun> I've watched every stream paige has ever done.
[1:52:28] <%patriotrenegade> Im gonna need another soda for this
[1:52:28] <Sir_Gawain_Lotsson> BABA
[1:52:30] <%thotbane> I feel like Paige's avatar would look better with glasses. Maybe as a variant?
[1:52:31] <%Lion_kun> Her mental map has never been this bad.
[1:52:35] <peachy996> Slow Mode is needed if she's going to read the chat for advice/directions/help
[1:52:36] <$SirGO0SE> nyannHypers
[1:52:36] <Latija> sonic.. he can really move
[1:52:36] <willyfreshness> is she drinking pinapple juice again?
[1:52:38] <+Grayhammatter> but baba...
[1:52:40] <@SoFarFetched> her vtuber DOES have glasses
[1:52:44] <BinaryBetrayer> Raise your hand if you're in the shadow realm for modding DS3
[1:52:44] <dds333a> @thotbane there is a glasses option
[1:52:45] <@SoFarFetched> that she can choose to put on
[1:52:58] <KeiganOfAstora> *raises hand*
[1:53:03] <postmortempc> I feel like I need to drink now after getting lost in the city of one street
[1:53:03] <%probably_facetious> @thotbane Paige's real life avatar needs glasses
[1:53:21] <CrimsonFox777> @SoFarFetched But she refuses them just like in real life?
[1:53:32] <@SoFarFetched> look vtuber glasses? easy to get
[1:53:37] <%patriotrenegade> no the glasses are only for reading
[1:53:39] <@SoFarFetched> real LIFE glasses though,thats another story geefBlind
[1:53:53] <%thotbane> Is Irithyll just like, the outer borough of Anor Londo
[1:53:53] <drawerinkshow> Paige is in an Idol meeting
[1:54:02] <%Ranryu692> Fleshtuber glasses require going somewhere, and doing a thing
[1:54:07] <+balouie> I just noticed is that the sonic cartoon music
[1:54:11] <%thotbane> like is it the stuff you can see when you look down Anor Londo in DS1
[1:54:13] <%patriotrenegade> Paige is like that Riamu girl from Idolmaster
[1:54:24] <%EyeFarted> We need to start a petition to change Paige's avatar to a goldfish
[1:54:28] <%patriotrenegade> big titties, empty head

[2:02:23] <%Lion_kun> Pontiff is like the third hardest boss in the base game
[2:02:25] <ElenaManetta> it was tougher GETTING to the boss!
[2:02:26] <%Ranryu692> Ranryu692 gifted a Tier 1 sub to ElenaManetta! They have given 4 Gift Subs in the channel!

[2:03:09] <Spudnacious_Dynasty> Kinda weird you kill the most important dude halfway through the game
[2:03:10] <%Lion_kun> Why are her dodges so on point against bosses?
[2:03:10] <%Ranryu692> @ElenaManetta you deserve a trash icon LUL
[2:03:13] <leinadtonu> about time a vtuber killed the Pope
[2:03:14] <BoxNavy> he was da pope
[2:03:14] <%Bt_Robot> Also the guy who did all the bad stuff
[2:03:19] <CptHarlok> Pontiff was weird for me. Came into it expecting hell, but somehow lucked out into an easy fight.
[2:03:22] <KeiganOfAstora> I don't think she even noticed the mechanic where the "stand" was a copycat of the real thing @PatStaresAt
[2:03:25] <+thatgirlpossessed> The hammer the best - overlooked strength weapon
[2:03:27] <Lone_Xeno> the Dopest Pope
[2:03:29] <$Sphincter_Spelunker> oh yeah, her sub icon does look like a trash can

Paige, I want to give you props for a great boss fight, you almost choked in the end but you pulled yourself together, did not panic, healed up and waited for the right moment to strike and finish him instead of panic swinging. Fantastic gameplay.

[2:16:06] <chronoxgp> this is funner than music and csgo lol

[2:17:10] <@PlagueOfGripes> when I think of how dark souls 3 is designed, I often think of this terrible room
[2:17:12] <$Sphincter_Spelunker> thanks, Obama
[2:17:14] <DrkJP520> i forgot the second one
[2:17:17] <+Mitchellsocks> The Pontiff bonfire is literally a 20 second walk away from the top of the ladder though
[2:17:18] <Lone_Xeno> aaaaaand there it is
[2:17:21] <%Lion_kun> shut up Plague
[2:17:26] <BigYanno> The windup on his attacks can be brutal

[2:17:33] <%patriotrenegade> No Plague is right, this room sucks

[2:19:47] <+Mitchellsocks> I think the run is literally faster than the ladder
[2:19:47] <%Ranryu692> shouldn't you sing it backwards when you go down?
[2:19:48] <%Lion_kun> I really, really hope Elden Ring is not rushed, copy paste bullshit.

[2:20:16] <@PlagueOfGripes> yeah, these guys suck
[2:20:16] <KeiganOfAstora> These dogs are no joke
[2:20:16] <%JenovasPuppet> I have never seen that attack and now I've seen it twice!
[2:20:17] <+AmanisHouseOfNonsense> Welcome back to Bloodborne Paige! LUL
[2:20:17] <TheAntiNihilist> Nice
[2:20:17] <Prism_Wing> I have never seen that before
[2:20:18] <chronoxgp> @BinaryBetrayer no it was more about sticking with the same vision of dark souls and not adding too much fantasy stuff that would be better on next gen hardware
[2:20:19] <BinaryBetrayer> Cainhurst Castle was supposed to be here in the original design, but they didn't have time to finish it.
[2:20:19] <DrkJP520> You did you not alert the second dog while fighting the first one?
[2:20:20] <+Gorgodrn> @BinaryBetrayer Not even the recreation fo Anor Londo per se is the same in proportion and layout LUL
[2:20:21] <+Grayhammatter> PERFECT KO
[2:20:21] <+zsDirtyHarry> I've never seen that animation before. Neat!
[2:20:21] <Copious_Koopies> MUNCHED

[2:20:39] <%Vextalyst> PAIGE ROLL SIDEWAYS
[2:20:41] <%SharkMissile> You're made of meat! :V
[2:20:41] <%JenovasPuppet> Lizards Round 3
[2:20:42] <leinadtonu> timing the dodge seems hard
[2:20:44] <danteftw20> honey
[2:20:44] <nip_nips> because you got honey on everything
[2:20:45] <%Draylle> arent you?
[2:20:46] <%patriotrenegade> I dont think that actually does anything with these guys, its certainly never worked for me
[2:20:46] <KeiganOfAstora> They suck because they're an actual tough threat?
[2:20:46] <+FoolsArcade> Now when the Elmo alert waddles across the scene it looks like he bumps into Paiges boobs
[2:20:49] <$Sphincter_Spelunker> he can taste the spilled honey
[2:20:52] <+Birdigalore> Paige has become THE ULTIMATE BIO WEAPON
[2:20:54] <HotSauceFiend> For anyone who wants to see a taste of that horrible shrek hack, look up DS3 | A Hack of the Shrek on youtube.
[2:20:55] <%pokefan9956> poor gief
[2:20:58] <%JenovasPuppet> Round 3: Paige wins!
[2:20:58] <Ner234> Consume
[2:20:59] <+polothegreatest> u r peach
[2:21:01] <luftraumm1> I love the vtuber, I just wish the motion tracking was better
[2:21:01] <MysteryFish_> @Sphincter_Spelunker pedRain
[2:21:01] <%Lion_kun> I really really hope Elden Ring is polished and Miyazaki took his time with it and it's not a giant rehash remix like DS3
[2:21:03] <+SenorCounter> You sure that wasn't PAT?
[2:21:04] <NireFuster> WHAT LUL
[2:21:04] <+TDotGoat> this knee tastes like knee
[2:21:10] <rekinom> Probably some of the honey you spilled
[2:21:10] <Dr_Mooose> doesn't he think everything is delicious
[2:21:15] <chronoxgp> the sequel to dark souls is actually Loop Hero
[2:21:15] <+prinzeisenerz> usually dont watch, coz usually not up at 4.30am. but cool stream
[2:21:16] <Hydrapissed> pat does that to
[2:21:18] <KeiganOfAstora> @PatStaresAt When people say "mash the triggers" do you they mean just L2/R2 or all the L & R buttons?
[2:21:19] <Badgerconda_> He just likes the mustard that's always coming out of your pores @PeachSaliva
[2:21:22] <%Lion_kun> And I love DS3 but it's so easy to see the seams as it was stitched togetehr
[2:21:23] <user_naim> Those dogs arent that bad, they have a nice moveset
[2:21:29] <Lone_Xeno> it is only a matter of time until gief finds out that humans are just bags of food
[2:21:30] <%Lion_kun> No pat, I love DS3
[2:21:33] <defaultname3887> a polished rehashed
[2:21:39] <MysteryFish_> tree frog estus when brionyTap
[2:21:40] <%Lion_kun> But it's easy tos ee the seams from the origina vision of the game
[2:21:43] <+Gorgodrn> DS3 is the one title in the trilogy that is actually polished
[2:21:45] <%Lion_kun> original*
[2:21:46] <$Sphincter_Spelunker> polish deez
[2:21:47] <anAngryHamster> Ds3 is a giant jerkoff around the firswt game
[2:21:48] <SGrim> @PeachSaliva human skin has high natural salt and protien content in the dead cells. Dogs like eating your dead skin.
[2:21:52] <luftraumm1> a polished turd is still a poop
[2:21:54] <+Hellhander> Geif: "Wats dat smeeeeel..... Dats Fooooood....."
[2:21:57] <user_naim> I like fighting those dogs
[2:21:58] <%patriotrenegade> DS3 is juts constant references and it gets annoying at times
[2:21:59] <freelancebabymaker> i mean how dare the game thats all about cycles reuse and expand upon old areas?
[2:21:59] <HotSauceFiend> excited for elden ring
[2:22:02] <drawerinkshow> Even the armored cores?
[2:22:04] <chronoxgp> dark souls 2 is more about wandering around, ds1 and ds3 is about overcoming the Trials
[2:22:04] <The_Vainglory> I like to think of it as "farewell tour" of all the stuff you liked in DS1
[2:22:06] <%Gouf_Troop> yeah but ds1 and 2 were fun
[2:22:07] <Hydrapissed> yah froms games are always like that even armored core lol
[2:22:09] <KeiganOfAstora> There's always cut content and things get shifted around
[2:22:11] <Monkeyweed21> Sekiro had the least amount of cut content
[2:22:14] <defaultname3887> yeah like even in elden ring the are demons souls animations
[2:22:20] <%Lion_kun> I just want to kill the fucking Primordial Serpents as we were supposed to in the original game.
[2:22:22] <%JenovasPuppet> Nice dodge, dog!
[2:22:22] <MysteryFish_> Those little guys tho
[2:22:23] <Mr_JustinJones> DS1 is not fun
[2:22:25] <+Birdigalore> GOOD TRADE
[2:22:25] <peachy996> There are still grey blank spots on Yharnam's map if you know where to look
[2:22:27] <@PlagueOfGripes> ds3 is perfectly polished to reflect other games in its shine
[2:22:30] <%Sotetsu> These giant rats are the hardest enemies in the game
[2:22:36] <$SvenHolgersson> HOW ARE YOU ALIVE
[2:22:37] <aximeck> That 1 hp survival though
[2:22:38] <nip_nips> HIT IT
[2:22:38] <cache_22> Blessed magic pixel

[2:22:39] <+FackinCrazy> Fucking magic pixel
[2:22:41] <BinaryBetrayer> @PatStaresAt And the parts they don't finish they jam into the next game somehow.

[2:24:10] <%thotbane> ONLY ONE WAY TO FIND OUT
[2:24:11] <%cade_calrayn> thanks for the sub!
[2:24:19] <+Mendin> Every woman Paige hits is barren, it is known
[2:24:20] <+ClericOfSparda> I mean, most of these people are undead, so...
[2:24:22] <@PlagueOfGripes> I'm honestly not sure if she's even a person at this point
[2:24:25] <Prism_Wing> :)
[2:24:27] <%JenovasPuppet> I am feeling exactly 3 levels of hype
[2:24:29] <%SveriSageAdvice> isnt the deal with Firekeepers is that they have to lose a body part to become a firekeeper?
[2:24:29] <drawerinkshow> That is so.. Fishi
[2:24:32] <%Lion_kun> I want to make it clear, I adore DS3, I love it more than Bloodborne. But reading up on how the game was supposed to be makes me wish I played that game instead. It feels like DS3 is a game of compromise.
[2:24:33] <chronoxgp> yeah the maidens have been cloned so many times they can't reproduce
[2:24:37] <leinadtonu> HA!
[2:24:38] <SMuffinMan> @mendin Tale as old as time
[2:24:39] <$Sphincter_Spelunker> he means the fire keeper
[2:24:39] <MysteryFish_> that is the nicest thing anybody has ever said about me peach
[2:24:41] <%king_wragles> He's talking about that specific fire keeper
[2:24:41] <mario_Sif> she has ascended to higher than a person
[2:24:42] <%SharkMissile> Paige has become something more powerful than a person. An idea
[2:24:44] <%JenovasPuppet> It man
[2:24:45] <user_naim> Also I remember baiting the shit out of those big dumb rat-dogs. I can’t believe people hate them
[2:24:47] <@PlagueOfGripes> the level up lady, paige.
[2:24:47] <BinaryBetrayer> There're no people left in this universe. Just varying degrees of undead and shit.
[2:24:48] <Hydrapissed> eli is also a vtuber so he is also a LIE
[2:24:49] <KeiganOfAstora> He was talking about the Shrine Handmaiden
[2:24:50] <%ItsRatman> Be nice to him
[2:24:53] <HotSauceFiend> si hit o him
[2:24:54] <luftraumm1> I think Eli was taking abt fire keeper
[2:24:54] <NireFuster> He's talking about the firekeeper
[2:24:57] <%king_wragles> But ya, I'm pretty sure she's just a talking mass of humanity Plague
[2:24:58] <BoxNavy> eeeeeewwww
[2:24:58] <+Marienkin> you cant kill an idea
[2:24:58] <%JenovasPuppet> It dead man
[2:25:00] <+ClericOfSparda> Yes
[2:25:01] <aximeck> He's a wallflower at the dark dungeon party
[2:25:01] <freelancebabymaker> paige he is not alive
[2:25:02] <+FackinCrazy> Thats carl and this is his moms basement
[2:25:03] <+heyalright107> I remember Plague guiding a crab into the ruins back when this came out
[2:25:07] <%thotbane> Archdeacon McDonalds
[2:25:09] <Profmcstevie> Plague, talking about a character in dark souls. Paige, "hey this is about me! How dare he!"
[2:25:09] <SMuffinMan> He
[2:25:10] <+Etherealizer> its dead lol
[2:25:12] <MysteryFish_> It's trash Kappa
[2:25:13] <%patriotrenegade> He's a covenant
[2:25:14] <dredgyboi> it's a corpse
[2:25:14] <%SveriSageAdvice> they look kinda dead lol
[2:25:15] <%thotbane> Archdeacon McNuggies
[2:25:16] <pabloelenano2> he is dead
[2:25:17] <%king_wragles> THEY'RE A CORPSE
[2:25:18] <BinaryBetrayer> because they're fucking dead
[2:25:18] <BlueSpartan119> it's a corpse
[2:25:20] <Lone_Xeno> "She"
[2:25:20] <+Grayhammatter> he... they're dead
[2:25:23] <+TacoSaIad> He's dead, Jim
[2:25:24] <KeiganOfAstora> no
[2:25:24] <chronoxgp> McChicken
[2:25:25] <%patriotrenegade> he
[2:25:26] <%Lion_kun> And I know every Fromsoft game is a compromise but DS3 more than any other game really feels like they made some last minute changes.
[2:25:29] <BoxNavy> hes fucking dead dude
[2:25:29] <%ItsRatman> VVCDonnels
[2:25:30] <+realm_forge> More of an it at this point

[2:26:00] <luftraumm1> FAP ring its easier mode?
[2:26:02] <peachy996> Fuck Aldrich, Darks Suns ride or die
[2:26:02] <%Lion_kun> DS2 for all its flaws feels like it has a more consistent vision
[2:26:10] <chronoxgp> Demon souls and dark souls are the same game, elden ring is a new vision...
[2:26:11] <%Lion_kun> Oh DS3 has some of the best bosses
[2:26:12] <MysteryFish_> the ring of BEING A PIECE OF MALE PROPERTY brionyTap
[2:26:15] <+Marienkin> he really died inside didnt he?

[2:26:25] <+Gorgodrn> The mechanics they even promoted DS3 to have were cut (the Bonfire sacrifice) which was a bummer. It seems what they anted to do with it reached Sekiro and mechanics mentioned for Elden Ring though

[2:26:59] <KeiganOfAstora> Pat, you didn't know? It's fine
[2:27:00] <Jaysky> @Lion_kun Does it though? It's areas not being connected at all feels more consistent? The elevator from poison land to lava encased steel castle in the sky?
[2:27:06] <$Niney_Who> Fappy Fina

[2:28:00] <RetroCop87> Did Paige play MGS3 recently or something?
[2:28:01] <KeiganOfAstora> Maybe cuz you stay up to 4am on a regular basis?
[2:28:05] <luftraumm1> what happened to pat?
[2:28:08] <chronoxgp> dark souls are the only games i can play through without stopping to do something else
[2:28:08] <SMuffinMan> @sverisageadvice it does warn you in the description
[2:28:08] <+StrikeTheErf> model just going AAAAA

[2:28:15] <$Niney_Who> Pat Now: too fucking tired
[2:28:15] <freelancebabymaker> ah now i see why pat hates this
[2:28:16] <BinaryBetrayer> @luftraumm1 That's the question.

[2:28:25] <%pokefan9956> pat is gregnant
[2:28:26] <leinadtonu> MY LEG
[2:28:28] <Monkeyweed21> ITS TIME
[2:28:30] <%Lion_kun> DS2 had a stitched together level design but I do respect it for at least being super weird and different plus the dlc are fantastic
[2:28:31] <%thotbane> REMEMBER ME?
[2:28:32] <%thejimjamz> ITS TIIIIIME
[2:28:34] <%JenovasPuppet> A familiar feeling
[2:28:35] <cache_22> Over/under on how many times she is sniped this run?
[2:28:36] <anAngryHamster> @RetroCop87 THe ladder scene is forever
[2:28:37] <Profmcstevie> Archers AT THE READY
[2:28:43] <$Sphincter_Spelunker> shot through the heart
[2:28:43] <%FriedMattato> Paige took a whole fucking spear to the knee
[2:28:43] <user_naim> 40 MINUTES
[2:28:44] <SpaceManHotepIV> get a feeling so familiar
[2:28:45] <$Niney_Who> Pat 5 hours from now: Leamg of Lemgemds
[2:28:47] <%Bt_Robot> REMEMBER DARK SOULS ONE?
[2:28:49] <+FackinCrazy> it upgrades your mace i think
[2:28:49] <drawerinkshow> Horible cliping
[2:28:53] <+SenorCounter> Pat is ZZZZZzzzzzzz
[2:28:55] <nip_nips> lets just casually stroll along while getting sniped
[2:28:57] <BigCoffee> wtf is this, anor londo 2.0 ?
[2:28:57] <freelancebabymaker> will she notice
[2:28:59] <%Lion_kun> DS3 feels like they were going for something different, changed their minds and made DS3 into a DS1 best hits mix tape.
[2:29:00] <filialpails> serpentine!
[2:29:00] <Helix_Snake> do you still get double invaded with no summons in this area because the advantage is so unfair in the invaders favor?
[2:29:01] <%pokefan9956> HERE WE GO AGAIN
[2:29:02] <%thotbane> @Lion_kun i always think its weird how they just casually introduce the race of dwarves into Dark Souls and then forgets them. Same with Milfinitos/Finitos
[2:29:03] <Ner234> Oh boy
[2:29:03] <+Grayhammatter> do you remember?
[2:29:05] <+Birdigalore> This all feels familiar
[2:29:05] <+ClericOfSparda> Hey Paige, I think you stepped on a splinter
[2:29:08] <+heyalright107> hey what is this, Paige
[2:29:09] <%cade_calrayn> has she recognized it yet?
[2:29:10] <luftraumm1> sometimes I worry that content creators are too pressured into being always online
[2:29:14] <anAngryHamster> Anal London strikes again
[2:29:18] <%JenovasPuppet> LUL
[2:29:21] <%vivaciouseff> @SveriSageAdvice iirc it also has a pop up saying it will break if you try to take it off in ds1
[2:29:21] <AthenaAegis> Rooftop archers again eh? Kappa
[2:29:22] <%JenovasPuppet> From around the corner!
[2:29:23] <+Mendin> This is the sewing club
[2:29:24] <%SveriSageAdvice> @Helix_Snake yeah its still atrocious here lol
[2:29:30] <%thejimjamz> Silver knight set is pretty damn good looking though
[2:29:30] <lazyraccoon6> there is the chloranthy ring + 2 near the last boss area
[2:29:32] <drawerinkshow> First try!
[2:29:33] <Finakala> Just as easy as it is in DS1
[2:29:36] <SpaceManHotepIV> phew
[2:29:40] <%Lion_kun> I want to reiterate I love DS3, I love it so much I miss the cut content.
[2:29:46] <+GenesisPatton> You got spears in you.
[2:29:46] <%Estuko> PAige is starting to envision they're all wymn, her blood lust is stronger
[2:29:51] <quesokano> can't talk, holding breath
[2:29:53] <%Ranryu692> Paige press A
[2:29:53] <+Gorgodrn> DS2 has a few good things: fashion, power stance, weapon selection, and environmental gameplay elements. Otherwise it meandered and introduced a lot of ultimately redundant stuff and did nothing with it.
[2:29:54] <KeiganOfAstora> There's stuff down there go get it
[2:29:57] <%Bt_Robot> A
[2:29:59] <CrimsonFox777> A
[2:30:02] <Hexidimentional> Try Jumping
[2:30:03] <freelancebabymaker> did she just run past one of them.....
[2:30:06] <%JenovasPuppet> sipsipSipsipblind
[2:30:08] <+Grayhammatter> oauge....
[2:30:12] <%Lion_kun> DS2 DLC is really fantastic though
[2:30:12] <%Ranryu692> Don't give up, Skeleton!
[2:30:13] <chronoxgp> @Lion_kun there was no cut content from jus likes to confuse people with trailers, so they don't know the final version of the game
[2:30:15] <Helix_Snake> "whatever" casually walking away from stone exploding from the contact of massive arrows
[2:30:36] <freelancebabymaker> yep
[2:30:38] <%JenovasPuppet> The trick to uncovering their location is to swing the camera around wildly as fast as possible
[2:30:38] <%thejimjamz> Actual first try?
[2:30:42] <%SveriSageAdvice> @vivaciouseff ah apparently you only get the warning in the remaster
[2:30:44] <chronoxgp> @Lion_kun for example promo images of bloodborne were at dusk
[2:30:47] <KeiganOfAstora> HE DIDN'T DIE LUL
[2:30:51] <%Lion_kun> I mean there was that leak of original game design.
[2:30:52] <Lone_Xeno> its fine
[2:30:53] <%Grimlockfly> ignore
[2:30:54] <Hydrapissed> who cares leave em
[2:30:56] <NireFuster> Did Pat go away?
[2:31:04] <%Lion_kun> Like Godhome with a futre boss and his baby.
[2:31:04] <Srthunda> whos pat
[2:31:05] <drawerinkshow> She is so lucky!
[2:31:06] <+Gorgodrn> @chronoxgp There was cut content. Some of it were een restored and or part of the network test build
[2:31:09] <%Lion_kun> future*
[2:31:09] <mr_saturday93> has she figured out the similar locas yet?
[2:31:09] <%thejimjamz> Bad man slain

[2:38:47] <bloodybacon> I can't believe Peach turned herself into a Vtuber.
[2:38:50] <%Bluwizard21> Is it weird that Peach does anime things, or does she do them cause she watch anime?

[2:39:14] <chronoxgp> @thotbane I was around when these games were being made, I didn't not roll once unless it was to run backwards lol
[2:39:15] <%Sotetsu> Chat is usually wrong

[2:55:23] <Aydarkzero> don't worry about it
[2:55:23] <Hexidimentional> so paige is bringing in the darkness?
[2:55:24] <Marakami_Sadaneo> cirBlind
[2:55:25] <HaroldDonchee> he was sleepy
[2:55:27] <freelancebabymaker> either that or he was like groomed by this shitty cult
[2:55:29] <%Rumbutt> also he's not dead now, he's undead he just gonna respawn
[2:55:30] <ToneBacas> oh quit out and load again to get an item
[2:55:30] <Spudnacious_Dynasty> Maybe, it's kinda unclear
[2:55:31] <BinaryBetrayer> You took Anri's curse to become super more cursed. Now he's hollowed the fuck out and you're turbo cursed.
[2:55:32] <%Kenzo2000> Mazel Tov
[2:55:33] <rekinom> If you kill the statue lady he wont get kidnapped but you can't do the marriage
[2:55:35] <%SveriSageAdvice> the chest is further down the right side
[2:55:35] <%Sotetsu> Huge chest ahead
[2:55:36] <@PlagueOfGripes> I mean you're all undead or ashen or whatever, so who cares
[2:55:36] <+polothegreatest> chloroform psaWhat
[2:55:40] <Prism_Wing> How did your character know what to do?
[2:55:42] <leinadtonu> roofied into marriage
[2:55:48] <Hydrapissed> I think anri might have been undead already
[2:55:50] <linSP> it was the hidden statue paige almost killed
[2:55:54] <Monkeyweed21> FEMBOY RING
[2:55:55] <a_mad_dragon_> slipped him a roofie
[2:55:56] <popecrispy> jesus, through the head too. thats brutal.
[2:55:56] <$Dotta5> the uno card ring
[2:55:57] <%SveriSageAdvice> that would be the most evil spot to put a mimic in this game
[2:55:57] <+Dirty_Dandere> Good Practice for later
[2:55:58] <+Bigbauerboss> TransgenderPride
[2:55:58] <%JenovasPuppet> Now you can be the Anri
[2:56:01] <+Etherealizer> yeah depending on how you do it you can choose to save him instead by killing a hidden person
[2:56:01] <$SvenHolgersson> The lady is invisible in a room and will ambush Anri. You can kill them to save her/him
[2:56:02] <%SveriSageAdvice> a narrow ass corridor
[2:56:03] <%thotbane> FUTA RING
[2:56:03] <chronoxgp> boi
[2:56:04] <$Niney_Who> himbofication ring
[2:56:05] <$hattrick61> Trans ring
[2:56:05] <+velemi> trans ring
[2:56:05] <Panda_Boxer> why did Paige go this route again
[2:56:11] <%peyodogo> TransgenderPride TransgenderPride
[2:56:11] <%patriotrenegade> You couldve saved him if you had followed your instincts and murdered the lady in the statue! @PeachSaliva
[2:56:17] <+StrikeTheErf> could have been a friendship sword
[2:56:19] <%patriotrenegade> Ring of trans your gender
[2:56:23] <lotharrio> Your character knows what you think they know.
[2:56:24] <%Rumbutt> @Panda_Boxer she wanted the most fucked up ending
[2:56:25] <Spudnacious_Dynasty> Some lesbian marriages have swords. It's new.
[2:56:27] <Aydarkzero> she served her purpose
[2:56:27] <IminyourBase> pat is not allowed in the room while paige is in her furry form
[2:56:28] <+Gorgodrn> He's not dead, chat
[2:56:28] <Hydrapissed> LOL
[2:56:32] <%thotbane> Look at your trans ring
[2:56:32] <+Vigonept> thats how it goes
[2:56:32] <LoliKappa> every wedding involves a sword
[2:56:33] <NireFuster> Everyone is dead!
[2:56:35] <$hattrick61> errybody ded
[2:56:35] <klooswep> It can't be Utena because it's not a lesbian wedding
[2:56:35] <X2Eliah> Yes, pull the bleeding chest out of the sword
[2:56:37] <$Sphincter_Spelunker> that's dark souls baybee
[2:56:37] <+ClericOfSparda> Big Murder everywhere
[2:56:38] <%JenovasPuppet> Died of shame because you killed your husband
[2:56:39] <BinaryBetrayer> Everyone is dying, that's like the theme of the game.
[2:56:41] <SMuffinMan> OOPS ALL DEAD
[2:56:43] <+zamatermort> ANRI ISN'T DEAD PAIGE
[2:56:45] <Marakami_Sadaneo> Why is everyone dying. that's Dark Souls
[2:56:46] <$DensityD> pull and kiss my sword
[2:56:47] <+HiroTSK5> They're dead 'cause jobs' done
[2:56:48] <Faustgesicht> Well, it is like that. But you stab them
[2:56:52] <@PlagueOfGripes> It's time to die is why
[2:56:52] <%Sotetsu> You gave her sweet release.
[2:56:54] <%king_wragles> @Gorgodrn The guy with the sword in their face? Not dead?
[2:56:54] <+TDotGoat> best wedding ever
[2:56:58] <%Lion_kun> Now for secret path
[2:56:58] <+Etherealizer> Anri is a hollow they're already dead before this lol
[2:56:59] <lotharrio> You can find those people stalking Anri through most of the game.
[2:57:00] <$WaitHowDidIGetHere> For all Paige knew that sword could’ve been a wedding present.
[2:57:03] <rekinom> Undead only continue to live on because of great purpose, she fulfilled her purpose so she ded
[2:57:03] <Monkeyweed21> NOW WALK OFF THAT LEDGE
[2:57:05] <%BlackSunEmperor> You joined a death cult Paige
[2:57:05] <quesadiablo> she disguised herself as that guy
[2:57:07] <freelancebabymaker> loving this sleepy lore
[2:57:07] <WakeUpThrow> That was the very same old lady you sucker punched
[2:57:08] <Prism_Wing> She died of jealousy.
[2:57:09] <$Sphincter_Spelunker> too dumb to use it
[2:57:09] <BoxNavy> ...
[2:57:12] <%SveriSageAdvice> you have to use INT for it
[2:57:12] <%Rumbutt> you're too dumb to use chameleon
[2:57:18] <LunarKeidran> Everyone died when you got married Kappa
[2:57:19] <%JenovasPuppet> If you respec'd you could use it
[2:57:19] <+Gorgodrn> @king_wragles You literally can see him in the ending. If you don't purchase Elite set, he even wears it
[2:57:19] <$shurtal> your girl is too dumb

[3:17:58] <+polothegreatest> psaDogchamp psaDogchamp psaDogchamp
[3:17:58] <PartyFavors> It kinda sucks for Gwyndolin!

[3:18:13] <%Sotetsu> Zangief wants to help with the fight
[3:18:14] <$Puhff> Oh wow I didn't know about the Nito part
[3:18:15] <NireFuster> "That's awesome!" Paige that poor child is getting devoured LUL
[3:18:17] <%MarylandJutsu> no hyren he chews everything
[3:18:18] <Hexidimentional> he just wants you to love him more, so he becomes the things you love by DEVOURING THEM
[3:18:20] <+Mendin> Aldrich is the entire arena's goo-floor and the bone-slug going up to Gwyndolin's torso
[3:18:21] <%MarylandJutsu> TAKE TWO
[3:18:22] <$Sphincter_Spelunker> he's eating Nito too
[3:18:23] <acridpaladin> yea the man that turned into goo is eating 2 gods as it fights you
[3:18:24] <scrumbotime> Aldrich heard of eating ass and took it to the only conclusion you can in a place this dusty and bad
[3:18:25] <Monkeyweed21> Gwyndolin is now a mid meal flesh puppet
[3:18:28] <Finakala> You can facefuck him if he doesn't use his arrow bullshit
[3:18:29] <Spudnacious_Dynasty> Yeah but once Gwyndolin gets fully devoured he probably just respawns at a bonfire or some shit
[3:18:29] <BinaryBetrayer> Gwyndolin's still alive while being devoured. You can hear him groaning and moaning in the audio background.
[3:18:32] <PinoProxie> he chew himself?
[3:18:37] <rekinom> Aldrich eats ass confirmed
[3:18:47] <fruit_pie_the_magician> 023
