[0:03:59] <Monkeyweed21> feel free to read it most of it for yourself
[0:04:01] <+FunkyStreams> You tried nothing!
[0:04:12] <RyuuAoi> is that Speedy Gonzales?
[0:04:12] <%medoodoo> @FunkyStreams LOLOLOL

[0:04:51] <+VoidShaman> It is covering the game chat
[0:04:51] <$Sphincter_Spelunker> I would suggest she does read some aloud for her memory
[0:04:51] <%Dakuu75> @waltzqueen to cover chat
[0:04:54] <%Keyd00d> egg
[0:04:55] <$skizzuto> @waltzqueen It's to block the ingame chat log for people's privacy

[0:05:45] <%nip_nips> and mustard

[0:06:47] <LordDudeTheFirst> Cat boy extinction by Bun Bois
[0:06:48] <RyuuAoi> Twinks OTW
[0:06:50] <%DianaTheAscian> the death of many cat boys in November

[0:06:53] <+FunkyStreams> yet another bunny boy to abuse
[0:07:03] <%pokefan9956> the twinkpocalypse already happened. it's called q force
[0:07:06] <$JoshManVGH> Man I need to take some time off for Early Access.
[0:07:09] <+Goraka91> @Dakuu75 Birds are the Heavensward extremes if that's what you mean
[0:07:10] <+logoth_> 12 hour tutorial
[0:07:12] <Rumbutt> there's less than there used to be even
[0:07:22] <%dankjerri> only like 5 hours if you know where to go
[0:07:28] <OneThousandTomatoes> reading it aloud probably extended the time too
[0:07:29] <Rumbutt> they took some of these early quests out in 5.3
[0:07:32] <%Dakuu75> @Goraka91 ah, gotchya
[0:07:40] <%dankjerri> i restarted the same time peach did im on level 26 rn
[0:07:42] <+Mekhet09> @PatStaresAt So where do you put your GCD to see when you need to cast it I'm a max scholar but I still have an issue seeing when to like atherflow
[0:08:01] <Rumbutt> you don't get to be a waiter in the Ul'dah questline anymore, apparently
[0:08:15] <%RealThiele> bernard is a great name when its said like bernerd old britsh guy style
[0:08:20] <%Chichen> green
[0:08:29] <RyuuAoi> Pat, where are you?
[0:08:32] <%grapplingwithdepression> Man i wish id learned to play on pad. I wanna play xiv on my couch now and swapping between pad and mouse and key makes my old man brain shit the bed
[0:08:32] <stoic_nod> Also, iirc at lv15, you can do the "How to play your role" quests by talking to The Smith at any Adventurers guild. Finishing the questline gives you a ring that grans a +30% xp boost until lv30 and can be worn by all jobs.
[0:08:42] <%other_badger> @Mekhet09 If you're on controller, you can still set up traditional hotbars. A lot of people will have a botbar that doesn't have any bindings but just displays various cooldowns
[0:08:42] <+FunkyStreams> Geez, this steam just hemorrhaged 30% of it's viewers.
[0:08:55] <+bluedude153> wrong person
[0:08:55] <Elky3> isn't there color blind options in the system config?
[0:08:56] <metboy_pully> It gets a LOT easier to get around once you get flying.
[0:08:58] <+FunkyStreams> because of a simple technical diffuclty
[0:09:01] <+Goraka91> Are you lost small child?
[0:09:15] <%Dakuu75> I JUST noticed the sign infront of this building is being held by a big moogle baloon
[0:09:20] <+Mekhet09> @other_badger Sure but like where on the screen is optimal?
[0:09:22] <+FunkyStreams> Money!
[0:09:30] <waltzqueen> mahnee
[0:09:36] <%Dakuu75> do they have to constantly refill the helium to keep this sign up?
[0:10:06] <%other_badger> @Mekhet09 Wherever you'll notice it but not be annoyed by it. it's completely down to personal preference
[0:10:09] <twistedhands> that's what you think pat
[0:10:21] <+wizard_of_diamonds> Is anyone else having stream stutter?
[0:10:31] <waltzqueen> @wizard_of_diamonds i thought it was just me
[0:10:33] <bleugh> big stutters
[0:10:35] <OneThousandTomatoes> i put a sprint on its own floating bar because I bound it to my r3 press with marcos
[0:10:36] <%Chichen> Yah im still having buffering
[0:10:39] <twistedhands> yeah stutters here too
[0:10:40] <RyuuAoi> @wizard_of_diamonds Screen went green for a minute ha
[0:10:41] <+FingaLights> @wizard_of_diamonds na, check .... Oh nevermind just did
[0:10:43] <supergoblinpunch> That's some foreshadowing right there
[0:10:48] <Monkeyweed21> @wizard_of_diamonds yea sake twitch is shitting
[0:10:49] <bleugh> nasa still ddosing the stream
[0:10:50] <horsebeefsupreme> hi peach

[0:11:04] <+wizard_of_diamonds> It comes and goes for me
[0:11:05] <waltzqueen> oh, better now
[0:11:05] <%SveriSageAdvice> Twitch is being really fucky
[0:11:07] <+projectmanatees> is pat downloadin all the internet?
[0:11:12] <+Lordgale119> Twitch itself is the problem
[0:11:13] <+Lordgale119> I think
[0:11:17] <Monkeyweed21> twitch is fucky
[0:11:17] <+FunkyStreams> @wizard_of_diamonds It's most likely on account of the interent succombing to covid.
[0:11:22] <RyuuAoi> It's not you @peachsaliva it's us.
[0:11:25] <+Ilpala> seems fine now
[0:11:29] <+logoth_> I havent seen much stuttering
[0:11:33] <%Chichen> You teleported 5 feet
[0:11:36] <%nip_nips> teleporting like ten feet away
[0:11:50] <%walternatorz> Paige has gil to burn
[0:11:55] <%walternatorz> through teleports
[0:12:22] <kaio_kenney> OH Snap! How long has Paige been a vtuber!?

[0:13:21] <kaio_kenney> too cute? Does pat have character too for co streams
[0:13:35] <+CalderGaming> what if a vulture took YOUR eggs would that be fucked up or what
[0:13:37] <+FingaLights> @kaio_kenney yeah, but he's too short to be shown
[0:13:38] <@SoFarFetched> just Paige, it was mostly so she can stream when shes not looking well.
[0:13:41] <OneThousandTomatoes> @kaio_kenney yeah
[0:13:41] <Monkeyweed21> you have to kill the mom and the dad
[0:14:26] <diontmack> always felt like the arr quest completem usic sounded like dragon quest
[0:14:39] <%kid_flashionable> I'm glad to see that Paige also beep boops the music the game plays
[0:14:58] <OneThousandTomatoes> remember to use Sprint Paige
[0:15:04] <metboy_pully> Did you equip the new spear?
[0:15:05] <%Chichen> Yah, the elezen
[0:15:13] <%Dakuu75> the monsters would keep your neighbors honest
[0:15:14] <OneThousandTomatoes> if you want to go faster
[0:15:15] <%nip_nips> they look like monsters to you?
[0:15:24] <@CreepyPorpoise> I thought it was gonna be "thats one thing I don't like about living in montreal, all the monsters"
[0:15:27] <Monkeyweed21> also all the monsters in Montreal
[0:15:33] <Elky3> KKona
[0:15:38] <+SWFanatic> lol
[0:15:38] <$skizzuto> Rip stream again
[0:15:38] <ArkSeaside> has anyone gifted her a Bulldog minion yet
[0:15:39] <Ris_Eltrut> Paige is a Yeehaw
[0:15:42] <+FingaLights> @nip_nips 👍
[0:15:50] <diontmack> you could probably run into a final fantasy ass monster in montreal true
[0:15:57] <%walternatorz> nod
[0:15:58] <%Chichen> you currently are
[0:16:04] <%zamatermort> Welcome to MMOs Paige
[0:16:05] <$Puhff> nod
[0:16:07] <%Dakuu75> welcome to being the MMO protag chosen-one
[0:16:09] <MayShip> Fetch Quest 14 for a long while
[0:16:09] <jorniev> moose IS a raid boss
[0:16:10] <+chill_o_wisp> and that's the whole game lol
[0:16:15] <Monkeyweed21> this is the gen z experience
[0:16:30] <metboy_pully> It's basically the gig economy.
[0:16:32] <$Sphincter_Spelunker> hang on there's this creature minding it's own business, let me kill it
[0:16:35] <%juxtest> Pro move, stunned him to stop the AoE
[0:16:42] <+G_Thunders> At least later on the NPC’s acknowledge you’re doing all their grunt work
[0:16:43] <+FunkyStreams> Stop acknowledging the chat, Paige.
[0:16:44] <OneThousandTomatoes> you're just a random adventurer rn
[0:16:51] <%Dakuu75> it's like "yeah, I could go save the world but... miss. schmit over there needs me to deliver her groceries."
[0:16:54] <$JoshManVGH> This is also the "who is this nobody" part of the story
[0:17:05] <%Chichen> and it becomes way more satisfying.
[0:17:12] <OneThousandTomatoes> cool
[0:17:14] <+abrupt_abe> Numbers get bigger, brain release good chemical
[0:17:14] <+maffewsus> press button, do combo
[0:17:27] <$JoshManVGH> Scorpion want fight!
[0:17:28] <+Lordgale119> @ArkSeaside not yet, and she won't be getting to that content for a WHILE
[0:17:34] <Vermillion129> Ayy we back
[0:17:42] <diontmack> this is the most basic boring version of this moveset too so if you like it thats good
[0:17:50] <%walternatorz> you're good
[0:17:55] <%Chichen> a bit here and there
[0:17:56] <+wizard_of_diamonds> Fine right now

[0:18:39] <%Chichen> recommended gear button
[0:18:42] <$Sphincter_Spelunker> just look at numbers go up
[0:18:45] <MayShip> things get cool when you can experiment with different classes to see what you really like
[0:18:46] <OneThousandTomatoes> hit x then you can compare it
[0:18:49] <+mariomarc> Recommended Gear Button pls
[0:18:56] <+wizard_of_diamonds> Its so weird to see an MMO played via console
[0:19:03] <%Dakuu75> I think if you sort the list, it'll put the highest level stuff at the top, yeah?
[0:19:04] <%Chichen> @wizard_of_diamonds she's on PC with a gamepad
[0:19:06] <%zamatermort> The recommended gear button is your friend
[0:19:06] <Vermillion129> What lvl does drg start getting eye mechanic? 60-70?
[0:19:07] <%HollowBeansVG> please use recomnended gear Paige its so much faster
[0:19:23] <OneThousandTomatoes> @vermillion129 ye
[0:19:27] <+wizard_of_diamonds> Correction, its weird to see this game played with what you play console with Kappa
[0:19:29] <%Chichen> Shiny man
[0:19:29] <+BioHunter> did pat put her up to this?
[0:19:30] <ArkSeaside> @vermillion129 66 iirc
[0:19:32] <+maffewsus> perrrrrrfect
[0:19:34] <%Chichen> yep!
[0:19:34] <OneThousandTomatoes> shiny person
[0:19:35] <+SWFanatic> is it not worth picking up all the quests in the hub and then going out?
[0:19:36] <+alphonseisbest> left
[0:19:36] <$Puhff> yup
[0:19:37] <$Sphincter_Spelunker> @wizard_of_diamonds Never played Phantasy Star?
[0:19:38] <%Dakuu75> <3
[0:19:38] <+alphonseisbest> yup
[0:19:39] <OneThousandTomatoes> ye
[0:19:40] <+Lordgale119> is it desynced for anyone else?
[0:19:41] <+alphonseisbest> yeyeye
[0:19:43] <%Chichen> do that whenever you get new gear
[0:19:46] <OneThousandTomatoes> all good
[0:19:48] <+alphonseisbest> She's doing it! <3
[0:19:50] <%zamatermort> You did it last time too
[0:19:51] <%HollowBeansVG> yeah, it auto equips all the best stuff you have
[0:19:53] <$Puhff> LERNDING
[0:19:53] <waltzqueen> learn ning
[0:19:53] <metboy_pully> Recommended gear is SUCH a useful button.
[0:19:56] <+wizard_of_diamonds> @Sphincter_Spelunker Never heard of it, either
[0:19:56] <Monkeyweed21> BIG AND STRONG
[0:19:59] <+FingaLights> QoL tips
[0:20:02] <%SveriSageAdvice> its the easier way to just automatically equip stuff instead of searching for it lol
[0:20:04] <+alphonseisbest> yea it just takes time
[0:20:07] <%ComfortableStranger> ComfortableStranger subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 11 months! Paige, please promise me you won't try to drink any more pineapple juice.
[0:20:17] <Azathotic> @PeachSaliva If you go to Ul'dah, there's a seasonal quest that will get you a free umbrella
[0:20:22] <AdmiralButtloaf> its only not useful when you have 2 pieces of gear of the same item level
[0:20:34] <+alphonseisbest> are u looking forward to h=getting to the part of the story that made Pat cri?
[0:20:36] <$Sphincter_Spelunker> @wizard_of_diamonds Sega Dreamcast, it's not surprising. Thanks Sega atpFeelsBeardMan
[0:20:52] <%Dakuu75> what level can you start doing actual duties with a party and stuff?
[0:20:58] <OneThousandTomatoes> 15
[0:20:58] <%dankjerri> big impatient
[0:20:59] <+wizard_of_diamonds> Segaaaaaaa, the theme of sadness
[0:21:04] <@SoFarFetched> yet she denied my pineapple juice the other day
[0:21:05] <@SoFarFetched> geefBruh
[0:21:18] <Latija> are you allergic?
[0:21:19] <+FunkyStreams> Its bad for your mouth
[0:21:26] <%dankjerri> very allergic
[0:21:31] <%ComfortableStranger> not worth the hives IMHO
[0:21:34] <Vermillion129> Yikes
[0:21:34] <+DeaconBluesClues> what about artifical pineapple flavors? @PeachSaliva
[0:21:36] <+FunkyStreams> has like a flesh eating enzume in there, or some shit.
[0:21:41] <%Chichen> they arent here
[0:21:41] <@SoFarFetched> yeah bromine
[0:21:48] <%Dakuu75> (I thought only guys needed to worry about drinking pineapple juice)
[0:21:48] <%cooldude69xx> I do not like this self damaging strat
[0:21:49] <%walternatorz> green arrow
[0:21:49] <+Gudren> Don't forget all those pineapple candies too
[0:21:52] <+FunkyStreams> *enzyme
[0:21:54] <+FingaLights> Is there such a thing as artificial pineapple juice?
[0:21:54] <%dankjerri> its why you roast ham with pineapples
[0:21:58] <%dankjerri> similar to onions
[0:22:03] <%dankjerri> tenderizes the meat
[0:22:03] <+maffewsus> @Dakuu75 You need to progress further in the main story quest, the first dungeon can be done at lv 15
[0:22:20] <%Ranryu692> Pineapple is terrible
[0:22:29] <+maffewsus> But you can do FATEs with your party members in the world
[0:22:32] <Monkeyweed21> sweet and salty go well together
[0:22:43] <$Sphincter_Spelunker> atpCap
[0:22:45] <+alphonseisbest> are u looking forward to getting to the part of the story that made Pat cri?
[0:22:47] <%Chichen> mmm hurty sand
[0:22:48] <+KingpinLarry> The forbidden fruit
[0:22:48] <OneThousandTomatoes> why
[0:22:49] <%ComfortableStranger> no hurty sand either!
[0:22:49] <@CreepyPorpoise> its on brand for you to drink pineapple juice even though it hurts
[0:22:51] <+FingaLights> @Dakuu75 Huh? Why do guys need to worry about it?
[0:22:51] <$GarbageNirvana> You and your hurty foods
[0:22:56] <+emperordread> This crack is so morish
[0:22:58] <%dankjerri> and its also why your mouth feels REALLY bad after eating a lot of onion, and why ylur breath smells bad. your mouth flesh is rotting
[0:23:03] <ArkSeaside> she's on the full version and not the trial right? (judging by her being a Viera)
[0:23:07] <%JenovasPuppet> Disregard belts. Obtain currency.
[0:23:07] <@MelBrooksKA> Are you allergic to teriyaki sauce? Most modern stuff uses pineapple as I understand.
[0:23:09] <$Sphincter_Spelunker> I still can't believe you eat raw sugar. That's what a toddler does
[0:23:12] <demiiluna> Can you eat canned pineapple because the enzymes are inactive?
[0:23:24] <+MidnightBurst12> give egg
[0:23:33] <Purpleleven> Ooh nice, just in time for this quest
[0:23:33] <metboy_pully> Who has egg? (but in russian)
[0:23:45] <%dankjerri> may i have egg
