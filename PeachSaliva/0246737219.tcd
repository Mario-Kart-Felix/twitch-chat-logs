[1:06:56] <Hawkbone_> She got down to 4 health while wearing the temmie armor.
[1:06:59] <%krawtch> the temmie armor just turned her into her dark souls character
[1:07:01] <deviljhojho94> Not this time

[1:08:59] <+tigerfang86> ahahahaha
[1:08:59] <deviljhojho94> how can this be
[1:08:59] <Objection_Justice> Hahahahaha, awesome
[1:08:59] <On_Target> you would know if you paid attention to anythin
[1:09:04] <CaptainSharkFace> This is why you read the notes.
[1:09:08] <cizal11> what a nightmare
[1:09:11] <BenLubar> if she had read any signs at all she would know
[1:09:13] <+Slimshazbot> WTF is it with Undertale and backseating???
[1:09:14] <+magusdraco> ...wow
[1:09:18] <deviljhojho94> LUL
[1:09:19] <+LoganPayne> @CaptainSharkFace fuck the code
[1:09:19] <CashBanooca> I really love that its called "Final Froggit".
[1:09:21] <$MonsterEnvy> You would have known had you not ignored all the signs
[1:09:22] <Innocuous_Goat> You need to touch the green to get the spare.
[1:09:27] <CashBanooca> It's so silly.
[1:09:30] <fruit_pie_the_magician> "froggit" sounds super derogatory
[1:09:32] <Hispanacomida25> He's helping her.
[1:09:32] <%krawtch> if Toby Fox is so great, how come he couldn't direct this fanbase to be not AIDS
[1:09:32] <$GohanEgret> @Slimshazbot welcome to every game ever
[1:09:34] <anar_bael> Only one hit
[1:09:35] <dontfeedthechocobo> spare the guy
[1:09:37] <+cvp5127> Just flee you don't need money
[1:09:44] <Cheapheatmo> THEN WHY ARENT YOU
[1:09:45] <+Spikyshrike> @Slimshazbot If all games were as easy as UTale every game would have this much backseating Kappa
[1:09:45] <+rooked4> Undertale is a mini van with a dvd player & many backseats
[1:09:47] <+ThatGuyfromMars> @krawtch no one can control their fans
[1:09:47] <DraxTD> and yet she doesn't spare XD
[1:09:48] <+TerryTheTurret> @Slimshazbot I guess It's really easy to backseat in this game rooShrug
[1:09:49] <%Kataguro> This is more productive
[1:09:49] <Aninidas> She says she is strong
[1:09:50] <+byeblackbird> I know *doesnt do it*
[1:09:50] <Objection_Justice> Spare helps
[1:09:50] <+Nefarious_Bear> SHE KNOWS AND DOES T DO IT
[1:09:51] <Schuhart> M-m-m-m-monster spare
[1:09:52] <stigna1> @Slimshazbot I think its because people feel passionately about things, and they want those they like to experience those positive feelings as well.
[1:09:55] <+GummiBunnies> this music is pretty good
[1:09:56] <%Kataguro> Paige values efficiency
[1:09:56] <MainMan_Jonadiah> The attacks get easier when there's more enemies, so getting rid of one just makes the other attacks stronger.
[1:09:57] <TheImmortal70> GG
[1:10:01] <Hawkbone_> @Slimshazbot Lets be honoest, Paige really, really needs the direction, because she has proven to be really bad at this baby game
[1:10:01] <TheImmortal70> She's getting better
[1:10:02] <DraxTD> full judgements!
[1:10:03] <+commanderclaw> Big Judging
[1:10:06] <On_Target> she's going to be out of health items by the time she gets to mettaton
[1:10:09] <+TechGamer> GUD STUFF GURL
[1:10:10] <stigna1> Without realizing it that the pressuring can make things stressfull/less enjoyable.
[1:10:10] <babblingcabbage> She has an entire box of healing items
[1:10:11] <@thenefftw> @PeachSaliva Temmie Armor
[1:10:13] <Kiryurules> *judgement intensifies*
[1:10:13] <deviljhojho94> MEGALUL

[1:10:33] <+Vostroyan1> Temmie Armor is doing good so far
[1:10:33] <$MonsterEnvy> You need to go to the elavator
[1:10:36] <On_Target> @benlubar what's your point
[1:10:38] <MainMan_Jonadiah> @FenixSeraph She already did the puzzle... And THEN did the fight path.
[1:10:38] <@WoolyFish> Thief.

[1:11:26] <richter_the_d> Garbage theft is a mortal sin
[1:11:27] <+RunningNGunning> That garbage can has 4 kids to feed
[1:11:27] <Cheapheatmo> Papyrus immediately dies when you touch the money it's in the code
[1:11:27] <LuckyLagomorph> Oh fuck, the trash ending
[1:11:27] <MoulesFritz> @PeachSaliva papyrus dies if you take that money you strumpet
[1:11:30] <%Aitch971> you can flee
[1:11:30] <%GimmieGarbage> She got Elmo feom the dumpster, ehy not cash?

[1:11:58] <MainMan_Jonadiah> That was Undyne's money, now that it's been taken, she thinks Papyrus did it, so she killed him. Then she died of a broken heart. I can't believe you did this, Paige.
[1:12:00] <Kiryurules> :D
[1:12:05] <+rooked4> That Trashcan was an enemy stand

[1:38:38] <On_Target> @MGKBurrito Only boss souls will last long enough for a human to absorb. it's in the library.
[1:38:40] <+thesounddefense> asgore is on eof the only monsters whose soul will live long enough for you to take it
[1:38:41] <%Jubelaious> Technically, only powerful Monster's souls last after death

[1:39:24] <missingangle> Perhaps not just any soul, but the boss monster soul? I'm not sure
[1:39:25] <cizal11> @PeachSaliva this was from earlier, like waterfall or somethin, but only a boss monster soul persists long enough for a human to take it
[1:39:26] <+TombstoneTTromboners> the glamburger is good tho
[1:39:27] <xSettingSunx> Swap a bisicle for the buttspie too
[1:39:28] <StarMechV> Drop the glamburger *GRABS MORE BISCICLE*
[1:39:30] <+Nefarious_Bear> why does she have that stick?
[1:39:31] <yodajr99> no paige a monster soul dies instantly if you don't use it fast and asgore is right next to the portal all the time so he is the closest one
[1:39:33] <+LoganPayne> @SnaKemuho fuck thats strong
[1:39:33] <KeithKuruzu> Wait, does she still need the stick?
[1:39:33] <+TomServal> I love how she forgets basically every detail of this game each time. It's like it's true to the game itself. She resets every time.
[1:39:35] <MainMan_Jonadiah> I don't remember what items he's talking about.

[2:07:59] <+Cityscape17> Yayyyyy im finally here XD
[2:08:00] <On_Target> i love the idea of Paige pausing her final boss fight to cram McD's in her face
[2:08:00] <+G_Thunders> Kidnapping children was enough to satisfy her
[2:08:03] <jayordanny> KUREJI TAKU
[2:08:04] <FenixSeraph> They're all kids
[2:08:04] <mothdude> Asgore killed Ness and Lucas.

[2:08:07] <+waterbuddy16> PAT SPOILERS PLZ

[2:08:09] <gamewarden92> It's a toy gun
[2:08:09] <anar_bael> Geez chat went mad
[2:08:10] <hntronium> They were all kids
[2:08:11] <rugelachs> kids can wear cowboy hats tbr
[2:08:11] <On_Target> and Asgore's like, "You know that stuff's bad for you"
[2:08:13] <%mojothumper> Its all kids
[2:08:13] <+SolidusRex> You can grind the children though.
[2:08:15] <+JenovasPuppet> Let em live their lives, let em grow older!
[2:08:15] <AlchemiBeast> its a toy gun

[2:08:20] <KeithKuruzu> OOPS ALL KIDS
[2:08:20] <+Pavi132> Asgore is doing what he thinks is right for his people!
[2:08:20] <Innocuous_Goat> Yes, partake in child murder apologetics
[2:08:20] <corepool> crazy talk tries again
[2:08:21] <InspectahDecck> Asgore worse than griffith
[2:08:22] <InsomniacPersona> theres actually a fan game being made for yellow heart kid
[2:08:22] <$ZebraFace> Spoiler Pat
[2:08:22] <bryanmildew> lmao
[2:08:22] <+TombstoneTTromboners> paige endorses kid killing
[2:08:22] <+FragmentNation> kids can be cowboys?
[2:08:22] <stigna1> Engage with the story! That's actually awesome!
[2:08:25] <thelonechris> Gotta keep her strength up
[2:08:25] <%xijiy> They had to kill the kids or they're going to eventually die underground
[2:08:25] <%LordMoonIV> just the patty's, why?
[2:08:25] <+Cityscape17> Im eating mcdonalds as well XD LUL
[2:08:25] <doofmaster> the ballerina is implied to be a murderer since the tutu is dusty, in monster world dust=blood
[2:08:25] <Hawkbone_> You Know Agore Had To Do It To Em
[2:08:27] <mr_slaide> SHE EATS 24/7!
[2:08:27] <$Mornaka> fucking love this music, taking a second is fine
[2:08:27] <Elexius> Hold up Asgore, lemme eat my McD's
[2:08:27] <FenixSeraph> Paige is a thirsty flower
[2:08:28] <grenadier42> Asgore is very politely waiting while this idiot kid stuffs VVcDonalds down her gullet
[2:08:30] <the_phantom_theif> The suspense LUL
[2:08:30] <Worldbrand> The empty gun was found in a dumpster, probably unrelated
[2:08:30] <%mojothumper> Toy gun
[2:08:31] <kwangalang> and people wonder why everyone hates the undertale fandom 🤔
[2:08:31] <+SagatAteMyCornFlakes> Lol
[2:08:32] <deviljhojho94> hungry hungry lupus
[2:08:33] <SGrim> MAD 24/7 LUL
[2:08:33] <derekwst3> Paige just imagine him as a WOMAN
[2:08:34] <@MelBrooksKA> I would have it no other way
[2:08:36] <@thenefftw> Hungry for MURDER

[2:08:39] <gamezerox> Brand food I love it
[2:08:39] <MainMan_Jonadiah> Is it a toy gun? Or just a gun with no bullets?
[2:08:39] <%siegmy3r> All meaning is now lost. All momentum is being forsaken
[2:08:40] <+patchwerktwerk> Are you wearing socks @PeachSaliva
[2:08:40] <+Cityscape17> apatFist apatSkelmoney

[2:08:41] <+biglabowski> Kids can be cowboys
[2:08:43] <zamzoph> "FINAL BOSS" LUL
[2:08:44] <Ell1ot> how did they kill an adult cowboy with a gun when they can't even kill a child?
[2:08:45] <Zombrocom> I honestly kinda want her to die so she can see the extra dialogue
[2:08:46] <%galaxyswirl> they are all kids pat
[2:08:46] <lilybergo> The game or the vvcdonalds?
[2:08:46] <+Comrade_Vladof> Put that sick boss fight on hold to shove some McTrash in your face
[2:08:47] <+Confused_4K> Oh this aint even the best part
[2:08:48] <mothdude> "It's so good" "But enough about the mcdonalds"
[2:08:51] <subjectg> Best way to ruin the moment is making cup noodles during this fight
[2:08:51] <%captainthunderwolf> @doofmaster Somebody had to be a murderer, yeah
[2:08:51] <cereal_box_conspiracy> I thought she was blwon away by how good McDonald's is.
[2:08:51] <APsaull> How many patty’s did she buy?!

[2:09:05] <vivecdidnothingwrong> woof
[2:09:07] <gryffinp> The realization that there's this intense theme of sevens that runs through the entire game is really something, when you put it together
[2:09:07] <misterspotswood> this is sooo good, let me pause all of it for wcdonels
[2:09:07] <+Toynota10> well she's got good metabolism so whatever

[2:25:24] <Cheapheatmo> so is there an in-story explanation for why the game saves between fights? seems like flowey would avoid that

[2:25:26] <Nixonesque> i didn't know this fight had checkpoints
[2:25:28] <Valkyrjsen> Yeah, because Flowey is saving the game.

[2:37:09] <MainMan_Jonadiah> Undyne can suplex a boulder, so she should be able to bench like 1,000 children.

[2:38:16] <+Dasbubba> @apocalypticexpress you can’t get the true ending in the first run even if you were true pacifist.
[2:38:16] <%Kashi_Nin> its the true cowards way out
[2:38:17] <gryffinp> People are forgetting that there's actually an in-universe reason you have to get this ending before getting the true pacifist ending.
[2:38:18] <%captainthunderwolf> When you realize that everything Undyne says is taken from the lens of a shounen protagonist, it all becomes so cleaer.
[2:38:20] <Kiryurules> FeelsBadMan
[2:38:20] <$undyne486> Like Goku
[2:38:21] <hntronium> SHE ATE THE SNOWMAN PIECE

[2:48:21] <+SolidusRex> To be fair, Skeletor was pretty buff.
[2:48:22] <ToneBacas> sex is gonna get weird in this household
[2:48:22] <%Gouf_Troop> Skeletor is actually pretty hot
[2:48:24] <Grayhammatter> paige is turned on by skeletor
[2:48:25] <+AmaniIsYourBoss> Now chat, we have no right to kink shame here.
[2:48:26] <%Keyd00d> What part is she at?
[2:48:27] <xeros720> paige has said that she found big bones attractive

[2:48:31] <ElementalX1000> The skeleton kink is the strongest of them all
[2:48:33] <RafflesiaA> Some of them are super hard, a lot of them are babby easy
[2:48:33] <Elexius> Paige has been looking at THAT kind of fanart hasn't she?
[2:48:33] <reonome> you can't die anyway
[2:48:34] <%ziriken> absolutely
[2:48:35] <+Comrade_Vladof> Have you seen how ripped Skeletor is? It's no wonder she's into that
[2:48:35] <%kzkinthemorning> Take me to the bone zone
[2:48:36] <thelonechris> Pat's gonna get cucked by Skelmo
[2:48:37] <TheBigTaco> Pat has to roleplay papyrus during sex now
[2:48:37] <@thenefftw> I died a couple of times
[2:48:38] <%TheOnlyStrayCat> She
[2:48:39] <Bundy_mcbunderson> Pat dressed as Papyrus using that voice in the bedroom
[2:48:40] <RyuuAoi> Skeletor was a fucking badass
[2:48:41] <+byeblackbird> Isn't Flowey's shit suppose to be near impossible?
[2:48:44] <MarvelManning> meme
[2:48:45] <%TheOnlyStrayCat> didn't

[2:48:54] <%TheOnlyStrayCat> mic
[2:48:55] <%krawtch> its like DOOM
[2:48:55] <%TheOnlyStrayCat> to
[2:48:55] <%Remery_> Skeletor had the sickest burns
[2:48:56] <+KanjiBestHusbando> Flower's fight is designed to get in your head so you make more fuckups yourself
[2:48:56] <%TheOnlyStrayCat> her
[2:48:56] <CMP014> I always thought you had to die the first three times
[2:48:57] <angryhawk178> Will they be doing genocide?
[2:48:57] <Hawkbone_> Photoshop Flowey is designed to be confusing, not hard.
[2:48:58] <Hydrapissed> to scare u
[2:49:02] <@Moobot> YOU'RE BEING TOO LOUD! (sugoihumanboi) (warning)
[2:49:03] <+th3madness> the hardest part is getting to the first heart
[2:49:03] <buffmurffy> your health bar is exponential in that fight
[2:49:07] <+th3madness> then it's on the rails
[2:49:07] <alwayspronking> Flowey's fight is actually impossible to do flawless
[2:49:11] <+byeblackbird> I mean you got through it so yeah
[2:49:11] <Cheapheatmo> you did pretty good
[2:49:13] <zucchinibread> potemkin level guts
[2:49:13] <+BlakeLocked> @peachsaliva Y'all should do it while the excitement's up - starting a new stream for just Pacifist is gonna leave you floating.
[2:49:13] <darkfire344> you can take 14 hits before death
[2:49:15] <Innocuous_Goat> You did surprisingly well Paige
[2:49:18] <emillionghost> U do good paige
[2:49:18] <+serpenttucker> "first try"
[2:49:19] <mczarklesby> Fastest I've seen a streamer get it done on first try, it was good.
[2:49:19] <vivecdidnothingwrong> demands validation
[2:49:19] <viviknight> Paige do goo
[2:49:19] <@thenefftw> That was actually real good
[2:49:21] <%kzkinthemorning> How many people in the world have a skeleton fetish?
[2:49:21] <%captainthunderwolf> Flowey's fight is impossible to lose in certain parts
[2:49:22] <cizal11> didn't some guy do it flawlessly on youtube years ago
[2:49:23] <%krawtch> DOOM 2016 health is loaded the same way. You take more damage when you have a lot but you get tough when your health is low
[2:49:24] <+TsunamiPoro> canon first try
[2:49:24] <%Quack_of_Dawn> I didn't realize that you could die on flowey
[2:49:28] <TheImmortal70> HE WAS SINGING ULTRA INSTINCT
[2:49:28] <%breakfastmegapowers> Paige did as good as most people did being thrown into the deep end
[2:49:29] <DesuDesuDokiDoki> its cool
[2:49:29] <lethallylactic> YES
[2:49:31] <mastermidget23> There's NO WAY she'd beat that.
[2:49:33] <LGWPhanto> Paige would never beat Hollow Knight
[2:49:34] <%TheOnlyStrayCat> Her mic!
[2:49:34] <%Kashi_Nin> bug knight!
[2:49:34] <LokimenD> @PeachSaliva next game should be Spec Ops The Line. For contrast.
[2:49:35] <%StencilOST> that ones tough
[2:49:35] <@danzig2> Hollowknight is good
[2:49:35] <+Camail> hollow knight is AMAZING
[2:49:35] <+Chimeraelite> I think Hollow Knight would break her wrists
[2:49:36] <richter_the_d> Roughly 2 hours to finish pacifist
[2:49:37] <Hydrapissed> oh dear god SHED GET LOST
[2:49:38] <KoyaMusa> "consider" as in politely respond and never do it
[2:49:39] <generalve> LOL
[2:49:40] <Caidezes> Hollow Knight's great, but really long.
[2:49:40] <Garthunox> No!
[2:49:40] <secondsigma> Hollow Knight is a fucking 10/10
[2:49:41] <+th3madness> HOLLOW KNIGHT YES
[2:49:42] <+Kalz0ne> its impossible to perfect flowey
[2:49:42] <+Jaysky> Hollow Knight is pretty fantastic, but only if you enjoy metroidvanias
[2:49:43] <mercado94> lol
[2:49:43] <thelonechris> Jeez
[2:49:46] <derekwst3> next time
[2:49:48] <viviknight> Pat, tell Paige to move her mic please

[2:50:47] <%Remery_> It's better than actually WORKING
[2:50:49] <suhmguy> If it was anyone else I would tell them to do it. With Paige, I actually worry that she will get hurt LuL
[2:50:49] <LGWPhanto> there's no way it's 3 hours long
[2:50:50] <ArcticAsylum> LUL
[2:50:51] <LGWPhanto> it

[2:50:52] <ArtThouBored> But we said 2
[2:50:52] <TurtlesAndTentacles> PEOPLE HAVE DONE IT FOR 12
[2:50:53] <mercado94> @PeachSaliva you could start the new game and end it when you get tired
[2:50:53] <miguelrod777> MAX IS A GOD DON'T COMPARE
[2:50:54] <+BlakeLocked> Pat, it's like an hour even if Paige fumbles here and there!
[2:50:55] <%Solid_Seth> Aw I got here right at the end.

[2:50:57] <CMP014> Might as well do the San's easter egg now
[2:50:57] <Firesparks> do san's room and finish the rest later
[2:50:58] <%SuichiTanaka> Being 'ON' for a stream takes a lot out of you
[2:50:58] <%captainthunderwolf> IT'S LIKE ONE MORE HOUR
[2:50:58] <+Dingus_Tickler> It takes 2-3 hours, but this is Paige, so it’s 7-12 hours
[2:50:59] <+TechGamer> Streaming is hard to do
[2:51:01] <fakemalegamer> IT'S NOT THAT LONG COWARDS
[2:51:02] <$rdark_ksu> @PeachSaliva being "on" is fucking difficult as shit
[2:51:03] <%TrevyWeaponsGuy> Is that why the Dumdums are still on the couch
[2:51:04] <$Piemono> And why Paige is addicted to Mustard
[2:51:05] <Innocuous_Goat> Take a break and get some sleep
[2:51:05] <SaltyDongs> Pat haven't you gone for 8 hours
[2:51:07] <+Kalz0ne> @DXLelouch24 paige is playing it might be 3 hours

[2:51:08] <@danzig2> Its putting on a social act for hours

[2:51:08] <lethallylactic> Just B urself
[2:51:11] <FlameLoneWolf> Eh, I think you should save it as one last stream.

[2:51:16] <iamtheTwitchghost> bUrself
[2:51:17] <+Dragonfang1337> I think they can do some of it now and do the rest later
[2:51:17] <Firesparks> do san's room and we can do the last route in one video
[2:51:17] <+byeblackbird> Ignored

[2:51:19] <+xXichibanballer> i need them to stop streaming I'm procrastinating soooo hard right now
[2:51:19] <+TheShal> Ask to move the mic closer. Moves farther away from it
[2:51:22] <MarvelManning> whoever said it takes like 3 hours is either a liar, or wrong
[2:51:23] <generalve> LOL
[2:51:23] <+Grithalmur> More like 4 hours if you take your time
[2:51:24] <zaklindo99> alright, i got the solution. Paige pop some adderal, Pat down the Redbull.
[2:51:25] <CMP014> it's that long if you do all the dialouge at the end
[2:51:25] <+Chimeraelite> You're trying to BE more of you. But it's vocalizing everything that's going through your head
[2:51:28] <MainMan_Jonadiah> Pat just materializing Red bull's from his crotch.

[2:52:15] <+StriderGerry> LUL
[2:52:16] <$kinghats> This is why Paige wasnt on the Women of Twitch for Women's Day: DUCK PUSS
[2:52:16] <DantesAnimus> Bleh, it's not that interesting
[2:52:16] <sirrice77> Also probably shouldn't do it

[2:52:18] <$ZebraFace> 2 TOPS
[2:52:18] <miguelrod777> NO IT'S A SOLO GAME
[2:52:18] <vivecdidnothingwrong> How does she remain so blind?
[2:52:19] <%Remery_> Fuck No it's worse than Undertale
[2:52:19] <Hispanacomida25> EH No
[2:52:20] <twistedj3ster> NOT ON THIS STREAM
[2:52:21] <canadianogre> got to the good part then dropped it
[2:52:21] <%Keyd00d> Yeah I just love flavor of the month shit
[2:52:21] <+DuckfishPrime> Chat has little concept of time
[2:52:22] <mczarklesby> I dunno I think Undertale is a good game with gimmicks and doki doki is just ALL gimmick.
[2:52:23] <%TeamSe7yn> HUEHUEHUEHUEHUE
[2:52:23] <Bncbck> DOKI DOKI <3
[2:52:23] <Schuhart> The windup is a bit too long
[2:52:24] <@corn_on_fire> he got to the troubles and he gave up cause of the edge
[2:52:24] <Hawkbone_> Doki Doki is really good, but the first act is not really great
[2:52:24] <+Walopoh> YES
[2:52:24] <$GohanEgret> 2spoopy4me
[2:52:25] <mercado94> @PeachSaliva its a very average visual novel
[2:52:25] <vivecdidnothingwrong> Like it's weirdly impressive
[2:52:26] <+Dingus_Tickler> Doki Doki ResidentSleeper
[2:52:26] <Graxe_> Do it on your own time.
[2:52:27] <SGrim> That VN is fucking trash. The twist isn't worth the gameplay.
[2:52:27] <viviknight> ONLY MONIKA
[2:52:27] <Zombrocom> It's a shitty 4chan creepypasta
[2:52:28] <waterstealer> YES
[2:52:28] <+OdysseyKnight> It's free. It's like you get free money
[2:52:28] <%Yumonikki> PAIGE, NO
[2:52:28] <+Exyoh> If you play both Imscared and Undertale, it's not that impressive.
[2:52:29] <+Kalz0ne> dont tell her anything about it
[2:52:30] <+serpenttucker> Kappa
[2:52:32] <Elexius> Maybe save it for later? its not good to do too many games with big plot twists in a row

[2:52:35] <@Moobot> YOU'RE BEING TOO LOUD! (Varadox) (warning)
[2:52:35] <twistedj3ster> it's a trap
[2:52:36] <$FoxInABeret> It's a slow burn, but it is all oki-doki,
[2:52:36] <+Dingus_Tickler> Anime Visual Novels ResidentSleeper ResidentSleeper ResidentSleeper ResidentSleeper
[2:52:37] <wmooring> It kind of is, though...
[2:52:37] <ElementalX1000> It is literally free
[2:52:37] <+AmaniIsYourBoss> Well, he streamed it for waaaay longer than he's used to, and chat was pretty not great. So it wasn't a fun time.
[2:52:38] <Bncbck> it's the best advertising ever
[2:52:38] <thelonechris> Homestuck game
[2:52:38] <vivecdidnothingwrong> no
[2:52:38] <%Keyd00d> Just play every game every streamer plays
[2:52:39] <cizal11> don't play hiveswap
[2:52:40] <devanmuse> Matt couldn't deal with the chat hounding him about the game. As someone who was in that stream, I do NOT blame him
[2:52:40] <Laironx3> whaaaaaa free?
[2:52:40] <missingangle> It takes too long to get to the good shit, and people keep saying "we're almost there" when it's not and it ruins it for everyone
[2:52:41] <sugoihumanboi> It's meme trash
[2:52:41] <thisisnotNR> yeah HIVESWAP

[2:52:43] <FlameLoneWolf> It's worse than Undertale, but Doki Doki is good. Just not a great game for streaming.
[2:52:44] <dkthefriend> the homestuck game
[2:52:44] <+DesertOfSand> Doki Doki would be more free if it was $10 and 50% off
[2:52:44] <waterstealer> IT'S EXACTLY A FROG FRACTIONS

[2:53:15] <serrishtar> @PeachSaliva just do 1st half now and next stream 2nd half and start genocide
[2:53:15] <Hispanacomida25> No Hiveswap. It requires you to understand some of the lore

[3:10:07] <ckangaroo15k> They colonists had no concept of herd immunity.
[3:10:07] <Darren716> NO
[3:10:09] <cizal11> YES
[3:10:09] <Prevot> NotLikeThis
[3:10:09] <generalve> YES HE FULLY knew
[3:10:09] <RedMaskBandit> they knew. they had sick people use blankets first before giving the blankets
[3:10:10] <+AncientToco> Paige is a genocide denier Kappa
[3:10:10] <%KingOfTheSpaceWasp> smallpox killed like 29 out of 30 of native americans
[3:10:11] <%Melchior_the_Wise> *unintentional.
[3:10:13] <Nixonesque> ive been told the primary sources were just a mention of someone suggesting it but no one actually knew
[3:10:13] <HatingSince87> stop defending genocide Paige!!!! hahahahahah
[3:10:14] <faegbeard> The smallpox blankets were AFTER most of the native population had died of disease. But they still happened.
[3:10:14] <bagheadlive> someone hasn't heard of The Black Plague!
[3:10:15] <+Comrade_Vladof> It was not intentional but it did happen
[3:10:16] <OldOnyx> people thought it was miasma but they still knew the blankets were contagious
[3:10:16] <Innocuous_Goat> This isn't going anywhere good
[3:10:16] <+LogothX> YESSSSS
[3:10:17] <grenadier42> Paige you can save yourself, just move on
[3:10:18] <sosuke5> The Australians knew when they did their thing
[3:10:18] <@thenefftw> 1,600 PEOPLE ARE HERE, PAIGE
[3:10:19] <autismweaponised> Not everyone knew but a good chunk did
[3:10:21] <+y5noone> yes, there are letters
[3:10:22] <+witsull> CANADIAN history class LUL
[3:10:22] <%swordsman70> We'll just throw these chemicals on these people
[3:10:22] <%Kurgash> that's how the black plague was spread at times, hell even chemical warfare via launching plagued cows over castle walls
[3:10:22] <FenixSeraph> they didn't know what germs exactly were but they had an idea
[3:10:24] <DraxTD> @PeachSaliva yes, yes pat he totally knew to kill them that way
[3:10:25] <+Exyoh> It was convenient. But not all of it was intentional.
[3:10:26] <generalve> it was flat out chemical warfare
[3:10:26] <Nixonesque> PAIGE ISN'T WRONG
[3:10:27] <KILLDOZZZER> They used to catapult bodies at each other to spread disease in war!
[3:10:27] <Darren716> I learned in college classes that there were no blankets, it was just spread naturally
[3:10:28] <+TomServal> Technically all place's history is fucked up. Everyone conquered everywhere from someone else. It's just how shit worked. It's how the World became as it is
[3:10:28] <KeithKuruzu> I mean, they used to throw dead animals over walls during sieges to kill the people inside with disease so...
[3:10:31] <%ziriken> The earth is flat until i go to space
[3:10:32] <ArtThouBored> You will alwaya be our hat, Canada
[3:10:33] <%Mr_y1096> germ theory in the 1400s
[3:10:33] <MainMan_Jonadiah> Don't fret, never forget Woolie's "no guns in WW 1," thing.
[3:10:34] <fang14> Paige, I'm taking an American History course, he objectively knew
[3:10:34] <Jaxiis0> also people knew about diseases being contagious through exposure since medieval times
[3:10:35] <zamzoph> IT'S JUST A PRANK
[3:10:36] <babblingcabbage> April fools
[3:10:37] <Wastelander181> Because people got smallpox A LOT
[3:10:37] <+Chimeraelite> Yea, Pat has a point
[3:10:37] <aslfrasle> @angriestpat You should check out "I'll Libera Myself From Hell" It's a mashup of P4 and Gurren Lagann.
[3:10:37] <+TeethMuncher> Why does Paige hate native Americans?
[3:10:38] <+Exyoh> American history IS fucked.
[3:10:38] <%Jjrossman> IT WAS JUST A PRANK GUYS
[3:10:38] <ckangaroo15k> Paige is right, pat is wrong
[3:10:38] <$Piemono> It happened at least once, and was discussed many times
[3:10:38] <DesuDesuDokiDoki> PRANKED LOL
[3:10:38] <+tank8173> They figured out diseases with the Black Plauge
[3:10:39] <%wispernrain> In some cases it was on purpose in other cases it was accidental it happened in multiple cases over time with multiple culprits
[3:10:39] <SGrim> @PeachSaliva it's unconfirmable, but likely. The British gave away dirty blankets to those they valued less. It's never specifically stated to be a means of spreading smallpox. SeemsGood
[3:10:39] <wsintai> Just a PRANK BRO
[3:10:41] <fang14> It was biological warfare
[3:10:41] <deviljhojho94> JUST A ORANK BRO
[3:10:41] <FlameLoneWolf> He probably knew.
[3:10:42] <%Aitch971> GOD DAMN IT PAIGE
[3:10:42] <@thenefftw> JUST A PRANK, BRO
[3:10:42] <corepool> just a prank bro
[3:10:42] <+Chimeraelite> WORTH A SHOT RIGHT?
[3:10:44] <%NWR_James> ITS A PRANK, BRO
[3:10:44] <deviljhojho94> PRANKED
[3:10:47] <cizal11> what are you gonna question next, the holocaust???
[3:10:48] <Prevot> PRANK GONE VIRAL
[3:10:49] <DarkVinceX> ORANK
[3:10:49] <@Moobot> YOU'RE BEING TOO LOUD! (Ilpala271) (warning)
[3:10:49] <Jaxiis0> he knew
[3:10:50] <LeeOhX> PAIGE he saw that the blankets made people sick and killed them so they used them and figured out what it was after
[3:10:50] <+xXichibanballer> Canadians just sort of started taking more and more land for ourselves because of capitalism, and we tricked natives into thinking we'd share. And we did for a little bit, but then we turned out to be horrible monsters anyways.
[3:10:51] <On_Target> isn't Joe Rogan a comedian

[3:15:43] <+burgerkingwiki> did she beat flowey?
[3:15:48] <+cerberuscarmine> ye
[3:15:49] <Twoiis> An npc technically says you have to fight him.
[3:15:51] <+Exyoh> I took ages to come around to fighting him on my first run.
[3:15:54] <StarSkullyman> yeah she got neutral
[3:15:57] <%swordsman70> @HatingSince87 It's the game
[3:15:58] <Innocuous_Goat> They're in the throne room/garden in game
[3:16:00] <SwindlerOfProgress> Plus the debuffs.

[3:16:18] <gamezerox> I have a flashback to papyrus last bone attack
[3:16:18] <DOTHETHINGBRUH> its like free victory
[3:16:20] <%Solid_Seth> I think the game eventually says "You have to fight"
[3:16:21] <MainMan_Jonadiah> Asgore is the first fight in the game where you NEED to fight him. It's SO unintuitive!
[3:16:24] <latgeek> god damn, every time. guess I'm skipping these donations and watching the VoD.

[3:17:59] <%Ranting_Raven> Pat, did you catch that all the armor pieces represent the children that have been killed for their souls? It's kinda like finding the armor sets for all the starting classes in Dark Souls 1.

[3:31:07] <ECRead> Unlike YouTube Kappa
[3:31:09] <@MelBrooksKA> She posts stuff on Twiiter https://twitter.com/PeachSaliva and I try to post it on the Reddit https://www.reddit.com/r/PeachSaliva/
[3:31:21] <+KanjiBestHusbando> You have to heart and press the drop down menu next to it to enable notifications, but it doesn't seem to always work
