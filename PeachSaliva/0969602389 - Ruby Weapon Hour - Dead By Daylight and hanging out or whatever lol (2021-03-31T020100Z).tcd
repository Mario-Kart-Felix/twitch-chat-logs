[0:19:11] <spamspaz> Streaming high sounds stressful
[0:19:11] <%SpaghettiTime44> Hell yeah
[0:19:15] <fatclumsywitch> ayy, finall managed to log in and catch a stream for first time lol
[0:19:16] <TurtlesAndTentacles> you look so dark
[0:19:17] <$NitronStreams> I get it
[0:19:18] <%SpaghettiTime44> I LIKED YOUR WEED JOKE, PAIGE

[0:19:22] <dan_g_v> drunk stream?
[0:19:23] <thbluewarden> well done
[0:19:23] <KeiganOfAstora> Well done
[0:19:23] <%sonlascivious> Paige back at it with the late night monsters
[0:19:24] <%EyeFarted> It looks like your camera's high. With those lines
[0:19:25] <big_oistin> honestly no, but good try
[0:19:27] <freelancebabymaker> whoo funny joke
[0:19:28] <KeiganOfAstora> You. Did it
[0:19:28] <Zeif00> You like those zero ultras huh
[0:19:29] <+Kinoskae> Fast Forward to Paige standing in the middle of a field, as the killer approaches, trying desperately to swap camera batteries
[0:19:30] <%TheOnlyStrayCat> BOOMER JUICE
[0:19:32] <CobainsBrains77> Wah,Wah,Wah, hello, wah wah
[0:19:36] <Gehtingsberg> I could only imagine peach high. God what a nightmare LUL
[0:19:37] <+DrFacilier> i think your joke was missing the funny part
[0:19:39] <KeiganOfAstora> Love youuuuu LUL
[0:19:48] <+mrshazboto> Oh - if it's kosher to ask: what was reason for long solo trip that you needed to solicit podcasts for on twitter?
[0:19:49] <%JimmyRuss> Open your camera apature a bit
[0:20:00] <spamspaz> Make a merlot/monster medley, a true boomer cocktail
[0:20:01] <prettygoodatstuff> Bang! biggity bang
[0:20:02] <TurtlesAndTentacles> a little more light please. also you are funny
[0:20:08] <%TheOnlyStrayCat> I know that feel. Always unable to funny.
[0:20:14] <@Jekado> lets do that later
[0:20:16] <+Kinoskae> push button make work
[0:20:17] <$Weeabooninja> Give the camera coffee to wake it up more
[0:20:18] <Sotetsu> Hit it with a rock
[0:20:21] <%JZPotter> fun fact, alcohol will eventually make anxiety worse
[0:20:21] <@Jekado> better not to mess with the camera during stream
[0:20:24] <%SpaghettiTime44> Aren't you, like, a comedian?
[0:20:25] <atgithursdays> It is horribly strange to see you in such high quality so close up instead of far away and in low quality
[0:20:35] <KeiganOfAstora> I got a new phone today! OnePlus 8T. I know the 9 is coming out next week but last year's model is awlays good enough for many years. My last phone was bought in 2016
[0:20:44] <%samazonsky> Hehehe
[0:20:44] <MarylandJutsu> are there going to be balls in asses?
[0:20:49] <%SpaghettiTime44> LUL
[0:20:51] <TurtlesAndTentacles> she's like Kevin Smith
[0:20:51] <Zeif00> More of a funny internet clown
[0:20:52] <%SpaghettiTime44> My b
[0:20:52] <freelancebabymaker> we dont really know WHAT paige is honestly
[0:20:54] <prettygoodatstuff> sick overalls btw
[0:20:59] <%sonlascivious> This new set up almost feels like we're on a zoom chat together lol
[0:20:59] <CobainsBrains77> Comedienne
[0:20:59] <%walternatorz> paige secretly likes being called a comedian
[0:21:00] <@SoFarFetched> "Im NOT a comedian....thats supposed to be kept on the down low geefPoint "
[0:21:02] <+UltraViolet371> the term is Influencer
[0:21:04] <%JZPotter> The camera quality is stored in the balls
[0:21:04] <KeiganOfAstora> You're funny tho
[0:21:07] <$Kaiser_Loar> must give instructions to Page like you would do with your parents on how to text
[0:21:08] <spamspaz> Don't you put "me funnie" on your taxes under profession?
[0:21:09] <%MrMatternot> Comedienne
[0:21:13] <%AshleyRoboto> i prefer just calling myself a dumbass and letting the chips fall where they may
[0:21:17] <%samazonsky> It does set up an expectation, and confuses when you're being serious sometimes.
[0:21:17] <%EyeFarted> Hillbilly chic?
[0:21:21] <%SpaghettiTime44> Writing humor and being funny are two different things, I get it LUL Kappa @PeachSaliva
[0:21:22] <$Sphincter_Spelunker> bork
[0:21:23] <$DarkNerdShawny> Are we playing Dead By K-Pop today???? PogChamp
[0:21:23] <+Kinoskae> But, is "balls in my ass" not comedy? Kappa
[0:21:23] <%skm742> That shirt looks dope, even though I don't know what the design is.
[0:21:24] <TurtlesAndTentacles> yes light
[0:21:24] <@SoFarFetched> you should be fine paige.
[0:21:25] <%samazonsky> Lights look good.
[0:21:25] <$Weeabooninja> Lights might be good
[0:21:30] <KeiganOfAstora> Yea looks ok
[0:21:33] <atgithursdays> INDUSTRIAL SIZED BOTTLE OF MUSTARD IN LOWER RIGHT
[0:21:34] <%Nox_Ludicro> More light would probably fix the camera weirdness.
[0:21:34] <%xmetalicdemonx> yeah we leave expectations at the door when it comes to paige.
[0:21:34] <+Fooguwu> Pat and Paige stream titties?!?!
[0:21:35] <prettygoodatstuff> I honestly think it's fine. maybe one more light?
[0:21:41] <Gehtingsberg> It’s fine
[0:21:44] <@SoFarFetched> Paige when are you gonna submit your photo to vogue magazine geefPlz
[0:21:45] <+Bailey__gaming> @peachsaliva what's the difference between overalls and Dungerees?
[0:21:45] <fatclumsywitch> light always improves camera quality
[0:21:54] <+patriotrenegade> @PeachSaliva If you had Pat's ability to stream almost everyday or Pat had your comedic ability, you guys would be unstoppable
[0:21:54] <TurtlesAndTentacles> REALLY?!
[0:21:55] <+UltraViolet371> ooh
[0:21:56] <%samazonsky> I got FIVE
[0:21:58] <%SpaghettiTime44> ooo, I didn't know this
[0:22:01] <%skm742> ahhhh, neat! Was trying to determine whether it was a playing card or a tarot card.
[0:22:01] <+UltraViolet371> OF COURSE

[0:22:17] <+Jonny_Worldbeater> Oh, Paige, that's not fair. You're  hilarious. Just, rarely intentionally.

[0:25:19] <%VexicBayn> @weeabooninja it can but its surprisingly good at not doing it, the ends of stuff can get clipped if you trail off tho
[0:25:26] <@SoFarFetched> Only the secret club can be having a Pat AND Paige stream on.

[0:26:32] <Schizocyte> Hearing gief barking in the background is so nostalgic for my dog
