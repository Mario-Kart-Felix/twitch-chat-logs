[0:47:23] <mathbertoldo> Here's my two cents for DnD campaign writing: Write what you know, and if you don't know, research throughfully. In short, read a lot about medieval stuff so you can get ideas on what to do, or just say whatever and adapt modules for your players.

[0:48:57] <+Gouf_Troop> SLIME CLIMB IS THE BEST
[0:48:59] <+Euphbugg> Slime climb is top tier

[1:13:03] <%shi013> Super simple 2d6 system. D&D can teach very bad habits. Maids is just about goofin with friends and meme-ing on each other and trying to win favors and one up each other. All traits, powers, setting, and events are randomly generated. Characters and game can get generated in 15 minutes max. Single session Maids games are the most fun time.

[2:27:24] <%Keyd00d> ???
[2:27:24] <WillyFresh992> thats why she divorced him
[2:27:25] <madogod> the magic school bus
[2:27:26] <%walternatorz> lesbians can't divorce?
[2:27:28] <devanmuse> and then that one kid almost killed himself on Pluto
[2:27:28] <$SvenHolgersson> Miss Frizzle 100% killed their kid
[2:27:29] <@commanderclaw> Frizzle loves to get her frizz on
[2:27:30] <TheDewdHole> Mr. Frizzle was a beta, couldn't handle all that magic shit
[2:27:30] <AtisutoCurry> I can die in peace now
[2:27:30] <RantingRavager> Why not both? A divorced Lesbeen?
[2:27:30] <Meekest> She made a mistake and things got messy
[2:27:32] <+ThePuddingDead> kill children? yeah
[2:27:32] <+goose_attack_almanac> @deafmutelaughing I won that game of hex a gone. The world rewarded my scumbaggery
[2:27:34] <phantomsleeves> it’s true
[2:27:36] <$Solidnick18> plant those seeds
[2:27:37] <$Piemono> Everyone knows lesbians have magic vechicles
[2:27:38] <+EscoSul> lesbian plants

[2:27:40] <zamzoph> "Make mistakes! Get messy!"
[2:27:40] <Habblewater> Nah Arnolds stupid cousin killed arnold
[2:27:41] <phantomsleeves> we do go inside plants
[2:27:43] <cowardlord> That's a lesbian
[2:27:44] <Sogeki_Dan> She killed her husband and binded his soul into the bus, allowing it for space travel and magic
[2:27:44] <sonofthedeepsouth> The best school bus drivers?
[2:27:45] <$SvenHolgersson> And she became a teacher to cope with her child's death
[2:27:46] <TheArrow_> such as venus fly traps
[2:27:47] <kumaprime> space scissors
[2:27:49] <Thewoodentree> @PeachSaliva She got custody of the kids
[2:27:50] <+chicken_danger> thats why they dont let women into space, it turns them into lesbians
[2:27:51] <+luftraumm1> once married to a deadbeat, has since come out as lesbian and a magical teacher
[2:27:52] <dredshift> The only lesbian that went to space was a crazy bitch who tried to murder somebody
[2:27:54] <%dekkitout> Didn't the only lesbian in space try to commit murder and embezzlemnent?
[2:27:54] <TheDewdHole> "Can you just drive a normal fucking bus, dear?"
[2:27:54] <Habblewater> Make Mistakes! Get Pussy!
[2:27:56] <GPAlpha> Miss Frizzle definitely sent Jeffrey to the Shadow Realm then became a lesbian
[2:27:59] <+goose_attack_almanac> Post-menopausal Ms Frizzel became oddly erratic
[2:28:04] <+necrocannibal2> that bassline was sick
[2:28:06] <%rumtumtugnutz> You know that she probably lost an entire class.

[2:35:09] <$SvenHolgersson> She Hulk Paige
[2:35:11] <%Lion_kun> Paige, why do you say it's fine everytime you lose, by definition, it is not fine.
[2:35:15] <%dekkitout> Your doors are punks, sounds like
[2:35:22] <Kristoffers> lol
[2:35:24] <Mendin> the score is still like 5-1 though the
[2:35:28] <Dhurkst> because its fine
[2:35:28] <%king_wragles> Cause it's fine
[2:35:30] <+OwlLightningMage> HOW ARE YOU BREAKING DOORS SO OFTEN
[2:35:34] <$Solidnick18> it's fine
[2:35:34] <@SoFarFetched> Paige is like "Its a video game, Im here to have fun"
[2:35:37] <Thewoodentree> @PeachSaliva Its totaly beacue of the dog in the fire room meme
[2:35:37] <NoireRequiem> THIS IS FINE
[2:35:38] <+SpoonlessAlakazam> mariaCheesy facecam
[2:35:38] <BallerSwagBro9k> She also says Just Kidding all the time LUL
[2:35:44] <Manmadeawesome> she must lie to herself to believe it
[2:35:46] <AFlyingTaco1> No never have fun with video games
[2:35:47] <NoireRequiem> "SUCH A WEAK MINDSET"
[2:35:48] <deafmutelaughing> when you say it's just a game, you lost twice
[2:35:52] <mcarora19> @sofarfetched What a loser
[2:36:00] <TheDewdHole> I believe in you Paige, get that crown!
[2:36:10] <SoftButtCheeks> PokPikachu
[2:36:12] <+IrishWeegee> that was rude
[2:36:19] <%Lion_kun> If only you took fall guys as seriously as Ninja, Paige!
[2:36:20] <+SpoonlessAlakazam> etalWoah mariaPew hi
[2:36:21] <Thewoodentree> such a weak mindset
[2:36:24] <+DappercatEsquire> paige you'll never be mlg at this rate
[2:36:25] <%Lion_kun> Hahahaha
[2:36:25] <iswearimjustdandy> Imagine being mad at her for not winning
[2:36:26] <Mendin> great now I lost the game
[2:36:34] <vukovivestrheim> First time tuning into a Paige stream o: good luck with the guys who apparently fall!
[2:36:46] <+OwlLightningMage> You gotta throw a tantrum after you lose or you lose twice
[2:36:46] <%Ipsenscastle> I guess I just dont have any practice losing
[2:36:49] <%dekkitout> You win so hard, no game matters to you so losing is the same
[2:36:49] <+PR0swagonist> is she winning yet?
[2:36:50] <+IrishWeegee> that was rude
[2:36:57] <SatoruMasamune> 「PANIC AT THE DISCO」prevents the user from succeeding at a task whenever they are physically near another person or being observed by another person in real time. Success is only possible when completely alone.
[2:36:58] <%Lion_kun> I belive you'll win the crown one day Paige
[2:37:12] <%Lion_kun> Like you won that chicken dinner
[2:37:14] <@SoFarFetched> @mcarora19 sipsipRude
[2:37:14] <+OwlLightningMage> You have to shit your pants after you win or it doesn't count
[2:37:19] <sydowoodo> u can do it
[2:37:20] <+NWR_James> @PeachSaliva Use your door breaking powers to get through the fake doors
[2:37:21] <%trustycoyote> @PR0swagonist Well her back is getting better it seems so yes!
[2:37:38] <Mendin> Paige if you lose at the game that is literally about BREAKING THE DOORS
[2:37:39] <+G_Thunders> It’s actually so much harder to win now than it was like a week or two ago
[2:37:42] <+SWFanatic> What do we say to the God of Fall Guys? Not today
[2:37:45] <SirKeigan> Doors, her worst enemy
[2:37:52] <$mckraven> This music sounds like it could be in powerpuff girls
[2:37:57] <SirKeigan> yea

[2:38:32] <$Solidnick18> pat butt
[2:38:33] <danknugglit> Breakin doors a game for paige
[2:38:38] <SirKeigan> I chose it for summer reading one year cuz it was short LUL
[2:38:45] <+Estuko> LUL
[2:38:47] <$Solidnick18> LUL
[2:38:48] <@SoFarFetched> @mcarora19 you telling me or her? cause either way don't be rude
[2:38:48] <%depressed_skeleton> Pat don't blame it on the dog
[2:38:50] <+dmtjinni> LUL
[2:38:55] <+OwlLightningMage> All you have to do is squeeze him like a sponge to get all the pee out
[2:38:56] <$Solidnick18> that was pat
[2:38:58] <mutantlunchbox1> Turd alert!
[2:38:59] <Reanimator83> You got a win in pubg so gotta get one in this
[2:39:04] <+MeatClackin> Blamin' it on the dog LUL
[2:39:07] <+SpoonlessAlakazam> 1446 etalWoah
[2:39:13] <Mendin> QUICK PAIGE PUT THE BALLS IN YOUR ASS FOR SAFEKEEPING
[2:39:14] <Aydarkzero> handle those balls!
[2:39:20] <+dmtjinni> wow ur bad
[2:39:21] <peachy996> I would advise not squeezing your dog like a wet sponge
[2:39:33] <peachy996> I don't think that would be good for dog
[2:39:37] <$SvenHolgersson> This game sucks Paige its fineeeeeeeeeeeeee
[2:39:38] <+OwlLightningMage> Dog loves are sponges wet with piss
[2:39:39] <%Ipsenscastle> best thing to do if you're overwhelmed is protect your own balls
[2:39:40] <kumaprime> ya gotta play defense sometimes
[2:39:40] <SirKeigan> *to the tune of Gloria* ZAAAAAAAAAANGIEF! Z-A-N-G-I-E-F!! ZAAAAANGIEF!!!
[2:39:40] <+Sinetha> Bully yellow PogChamp
[2:39:42] <%Ipsenscastle> advice for life
[2:39:45] <+shaella> Just remember that nobody likes Yellow
[2:39:46] <+DappercatEsquire> don't worry, it's a team game, blame all these other losers
[2:39:54] <+Estuko> Can you imagine gaining the ability to double jump in real life but the catch is that you become limp after the 2nd leap? Fall Guys style.
[2:39:55] <+ItsCaptainDisco> Will you be getting a Gief emote?
[2:39:56] <$SvenHolgersson> They should let you grab the balls
[2:39:58] <mcarora19> @sofarfetched Oh you're being serious. Sorry I misread. My original comment was supposed to be a joke. Sorry if I overdid it.
[2:39:58] <+Sdeje> Blue was just hoarding everything
[2:40:05] <$SvenHolgersson> I want to grab the balls very much
[2:40:10] <+IrishWeegee> qqwwwwweew zxcaseqrw124`sdfbvcb
[2:40:21] <+dmtjinni> pfffft
[2:40:25] <Aydarkzero> almost there!
[2:40:27] <SatoruMasamune> 「PANIC AT THE DISCO」also prevents the user from ever taking responsibility for their failures, forcing them to try and blame others nearby for their own spastic freak-outs.
[2:40:28] <Valdorick> At least yellow is fuck
[2:40:30] <@SoFarFetched> @mcarora19 oh dude no worries,text is hard to tell at times LUL so my bad on that.
[2:40:30] <RantingRavager> Someone typed in their password
[2:40:34] <$Solidnick18> overtime again
[2:40:35] <+OwlLightningMage> This feels like Paige playing this game for real
[2:40:36] <Dementedpenguin> psaCrazyhead ?
[2:40:38] <Valdorick> OH NO BLUE IS TRYING TOO HARD
[2:40:40] <%Lion_kun> these challenges seem predicated on two teams screwing a third
[2:40:41] <%Ipsenscastle> F
[2:40:41] <TheIncoherentGamer> last second ball
[2:40:43] <+luftraumm1> psaCrazyhand
[2:40:44] <+yulytutful> try just pressing X when running at the ball rather than jumping then hitting X
[2:40:46] <puse9> crazy talk!
[2:40:47] <RantingRavager> PogChamp YOU WON
[2:40:47] <MetalSlimeHunt> [AUTOMATIC MODE]
[2:40:49] <$SvenHolgersson> This game better be dead in the next season

[2:41:21] <+JellyMat> he slying it's EASY
[2:41:22] <puse9> you dodge
[2:41:29] <Dementedpenguin> I'd rather they retire tail grab first
[2:41:30] <wannabemoogle> It's Themed! I hope they do a space one!
[2:41:31] <+OwlLightningMage> Everyone should make their password, Password
[2:41:33] <$Solidnick18> oh boy
[2:41:33] <pennykettle_> There better be more maps before the next season. How far away is that? And we only saw 3 so far
[2:41:34] <kumaprime> it needs rollback
[2:41:34] <+SWFanatic> L I T
[2:41:34] <@Calek> man it'd be a shame if all tail grab games just stopped existing next season
[2:41:36] <+luftraumm1> man I would watch much more sports ball if it had 3 teams and 8 balls
[2:41:36] <danknugglit> Stay in middle

[2:42:06] <$KnivesEve> yeah be a shame for fall ball...
[2:42:06] <GarbageQueenEllie> Fall Guys is a good name for this game. Really captures the feeling of universal mistrust
[2:42:06] <%ArtemisM822> Stay closer to front
[2:42:09] <+SWFanatic> BIG
[2:42:17] <%juxtest> I got pushed off by other people getting pushed off right at the end of this game once

[2:45:58] <GPAlpha> Yeah, Tip Toe can be a bitch so it's no worries
[2:46:00] <+G_Thunders> Once you’re about halfway you can start pathing out which rows can’t be correct by looking at what shakes
[2:46:01] <AFlyingTaco1> That's a good mindset for real, Paige. Don't let hate consume you like it does me.
[2:46:03] <MyNameIsRasus> This game never makes me legit mad
[2:46:03] <GarbageQueenEllie> I can see this being frustrating, but I'm just not competitive with this type of thing.
[2:46:04] <@SoFarFetched> I think it's the way the characters look,music and noise they make

[2:50:12] <Doofmaster> the game is so free they throw themselves off out of boredom
[2:50:20] <+DappercatEsquire> cheer200 @PeachSaliva this is for making me feel better about my skill in this game

[3:27:19] <Shishi1205> I hate the horse fuckers
[3:27:20] <+GabeSweetMan> I've found that trying to grab other people only EVER gets you eliminated because you can't jump while grabbing.

[3:28:01] <Who_lio42> that lone block that comes around is my favorite
