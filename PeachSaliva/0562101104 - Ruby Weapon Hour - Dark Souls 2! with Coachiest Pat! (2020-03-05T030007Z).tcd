[0:50:41] <$Solidnick18> He just like cute things
[0:50:41] <%CommanderSqueaks> Was that the English voice director or the Japanese?
[0:50:42] <+Reevesypoo> How can a written language be gay?

[0:50:51] <heartlesshealer> Cake debate reignited!
[0:50:51] <DracaenaLeaf> that's gay
[0:50:51] <%SoFarFetched> He's actually just a sensitive guy.
[0:50:51] <shouttothevoid> Kanji is bi at best
[0:50:53] <Finakala> P4 is so fucking good

[0:50:56] <+Lazy_Vagabond> how is that not stereotypical?
[0:50:57] <+zabando> They are not a cukcake. I am a baker.
[0:50:58] <sjcodan> Naoto isn't trans, either
[0:50:58] <$Solidnick18> He likes cute things that's it
[0:50:59] <+Exicuren> STOP LYING PAT
[0:50:59] <waterstealer> that sounds like you made that up pat
[0:50:59] <%CommanderSqueaks> Oh this is a minefield.
[0:51:00] <Chimeraelite> I just care if he fucks Naoto @PeachSaliva
[0:51:00] <+KENTASHIRO> but Tomokazu Seki wasn't told that, Pat
[0:51:01] <+AMSTHEGREAT> could be bi

[0:51:04] <honeyman18> He the psaBig GAY
[0:51:04] <%GabeSweetMan> Kanj is the BEST part of P4 regardless.
[0:51:05] <+BubbaRands> He's note just effeminate
[0:51:05] <+arancet> kanji is probably gay, but hes depicted as conflicted and still sorting it out
[0:51:06] <%ShockzNDrawe> I can explain later if u want
[0:51:07] <+trekkie11041> HE LIKES NAOTO
[0:51:08] <chronoxgp> KappaPride
[0:51:08] <%wsintai> Oh fuck this again
[0:51:09] <%ArtemisM822> Kanji is bi or questioning
[0:51:09] <filialpails> THERE'S NO SUCH THING AS STRAIGHT PEOPLE
[0:51:09] <%ssjklyco> I just got a Vita and just started Golden
[0:51:09] <frozenottsel> Subtlety and Persona.....
[0:51:09] <cureneckbeard> I know writers who use subtlety. They're cowards
[0:51:10] <Zaphire_Saucypants> queer isn't gay so much as wiggle-room gay.
[0:51:10] <%ShichiNoBushi> It's possible to be gay and not flamboyantly gay.
[0:51:10] <lego_beef> PLEASE
[0:51:11] <+doc_ock_rokc> It was a TRANSLATOR that decided he was gay the writers say no
[0:51:12] <%QueequegTheater> @PeachSaliva Literally the entire point of Kanji is that he likes feminine things but isn't gay
[0:51:14] <+masked_hero_lucky> Ah yees, a gay man who's obviously very into a woman
[0:51:15] <Prevot> the whole point of his story is that he ISN'T gay just for liking girly things
[0:51:18] <OwlLightningMage> MUFFINS ARE CAKES
[0:51:18] <goose_attack_almanac> Kanji's not gay. He's just into Traps.
[0:51:19] <%spiritofmojave> Oh no, this explosion of discourse
[0:51:19] <%peachy996> All the gay Kanji porn tells me he is gay
[0:51:20] <trianglehat> twitchlet Pat
[0:51:20] <+lethallylactic> Like the whole entire point of Kanji's character arc is learning to accept that having so-called "feminine" interests doesn't make him any less of a man.
[0:51:22] <%DesuDesuDokiDoki> nani
[0:51:22] <%GabeSweetMan> Straight people are a myth.

[0:51:28] <%QueequegTheater> @PeachSaliva Also Naoto isn't trans

[0:51:33] <$Sphincter_Spelunker> I didn't recognize adult business man Kanji
[0:51:34] <%ssjklyco> Hours wise, Pat has streamed more
[0:51:34] <Stab_master_ars0n> Kanji likes the pussy though because he‚Äôs got a hard on for naoto
[0:51:37] <StarlitStunner> He has the hots for Naoto tho and she has huge chest beefers

[1:25:22] <SpaceCatStation> @PabuPanda Bi...?
[1:25:23] <+doc_ock_rokc> Thing that gets me is that people who are all about "Being gay doesn't mean these stereotypes" are quick to use said steretotypes to say someone is gay

[1:27:50] <+doc_ock_rokc> @abelincoln_catpuncher stay safe. Hope you bought water and food
[1:27:51] <%Lion_kun> Half gay is when you have a character who should be gay but the company that made him is too homophobic to make him gay so they settle for effiminate instead.
[1:27:52] <+linSP> thats crazy talk
[1:27:53] <$DesertPenguin> @PatStaresAt Hammer is better overall
[1:27:53] <%SoFarFetched> @PatStaresAt Are you gonna have Paige get the other hammer from that one blacksmith that puts elements into your weapons? I did his hammer and put Raw into it.
[1:27:53] <+SWFanatic> He Can Really MoOoOve
[1:27:55] <%MoulesFritz> toyota reliability is no joke, the ridgeline is cheaply-made and badly underpowered
[1:27:57] <Zaphire_Saucypants> @PabuPanda Nah, don't. Ain't nothin wrong with bein a slut.
[1:27:58] <%QueequegTheater> @PatStaresAt Mea Culpa: I looked up some interviews and the project lead said Kanji is sort of gay
[1:28:03] <$DesertPenguin> @PeachSaliva Hope all is well

[1:28:05] <%jaxondorf> hey Pat.
[1:28:07] <+originfacts> wait
[1:28:08] <+patriotrenegade> Pat likes Reshiram, right
[1:28:09] <$Niney_Who> She'd just have to stay in that right side where there's less statues
[1:28:11] <%QueequegTheater> @PatStaresAt So I was wrong but so were you
[1:28:14] <+originfacts> is that heinz slime ketchup
[1:28:14] <$Jack_of_No_Trades> @MoulesFritz That sounds good to know, thanks. Reliability is a big priority

[1:28:40] <%peachy996> I never had the thread

[2:45:32] <CaptainKarite> So Yu is also bi
[2:45:32] <%maskofmichael> Spaghetti is on;y for people who don't die
[2:45:33] <Zeemod155> Shrodinger's Gay
[2:45:33] <%Keyd00d> Yosuke is the gayest person in that game
[2:45:33] <Nina96> I WAS ROBBED
[2:45:35] <%QueequegTheater> Really? Interesting
[2:45:36] <%SvenHolgersson> Schr√∂dinger's Sexuality
[2:45:36] <derap41> Stop ripping ass
[2:45:37] <Drusain> no way fam
[2:45:37] <LaughingCatt> I always thought Yosuke was closeted
[2:45:38] <%GabeSweetMan> I thought he was bi when I played cuz of his attraction to Naoto.
[2:45:39] <RagingLeo> he's a tough dude with a soft side
[2:45:40] <%eviljake9> Yuri recorded those lines
[2:45:41] <$R3Roundabout> HOW DARE THEY DENY US A PIECE OF HIM!
[2:45:42] <T_Sasquatch> Its not like he wanted to plow naoto as a dude
[2:45:42] <%Keyd00d> Even in the final product
[2:45:43] <Ashenik1> Arent we all BI though
[2:45:43] <@PlagueOfGripes> Do they not have a word for bisexual or are they just being stupid
[2:45:44] <%peachy996> Naoto is a B E A R D
[2:45:46] <%SirGO0SE> yo suke deez nutz
[2:45:50] <FennecZephyr> Yeah, that would have redeemed him
[2:45:51] <Grandma_Amari> What about Elmo's spaghetti? BibleThump
[2:45:52] <KitsuneManami> @PeachSaliva None of this is real, and Kanji wasnt gay
[2:45:54] <RyuuAoi> I mean who wouldn't bend Yosuke? Honestly.
[2:45:54] <Drusain> yosuke no way fam
[2:45:56] <filialpails> yosuke's romance social link even has english voice acting
[2:45:56] <cureneckbeard> gay tsundere
[2:45:57] <+Jaysky> Isn't that exactly why it makes sense?
[2:45:58] <Blank9> yosuke is absolutely closeted and projecting
[2:45:58] <%Dragon_Batman> That would make sense
[2:46:00] <+b1gboss007> sirve tho?
[2:46:02] <Animorphimagi> Thats dumb logic
[2:46:02] <$Sphincter_Spelunker> Yosuke's crush was a such a cunt. Wish that got resolved
[2:46:03] <%perspectivphilosophr> I always wanted to romance yosuke
[2:46:08] <%spiritofmojave> Would definitely redeem his homophobia Yosuke has in the whole camping thing
[2:46:08] <+Speedwagon_13> Yeah, he‚Äôs interested in naoto even after he finds out she‚Äôs a girl
[2:46:09] <zac_nap94> Hey kate paige take the cat ring off now
[2:46:09] <cureneckbeard> And Monster energy.
[2:46:12] <waterstealer> what about salami
[2:46:12] <%consistentlylistless> hairsketti
[2:46:14] <%Jekado> only his own hair spaghetti
[2:46:16] <qu3kl41n_the_impure_king> reminder pat, Atlas totally greenlit a Persona 5 anime thats already aired, but NO STREAMS THOUGH
[2:46:17] <sentientvin> Persona is just a homophobic mess even for japanese standards
[2:46:17] <zac_nap94> cant*
[2:46:20] <%Dragon_Batman> There must be something else
[2:46:21] <%QueequegTheater> @kitsunemanami Its literally an interview with the project lead of 04
[2:46:22] <$lotharrio> Well put some tomato sauce on that spaghetti, that's poisonous to cats I think.
[2:46:22] <oniwahoo> I'm pretty sure spaghetti is bad for cat, Pat
[2:46:22] <+Jaysky> He's projecting and is constantly concerned how gay he might get hanging about Kanji
[2:46:23] <MasterDecoder> Pretty sure Spaghetti would hurt him
[2:46:27] <%QueequegTheater> *P4
[2:46:28] <Tucker0603> by the way the rat group summons people to you, not you to them
[2:46:31] <CrookedNoseArts> Elmo's last name is spaghetti
[2:46:32] <+Taglog7> SingsNote CHOCOLATE HAIR SingsNote
[2:46:37] <%sleepy_coffee> Keep that chocolate hair away from@the bb
[2:46:38] <derap41> Knights ring
[2:46:39] <Grandma_Amari> Spaghetti is just the food edition of hair.
[2:46:40] <%GabeSweetMan> One day I too hope to have an underwhelming gay romance in a Persona game.
[2:46:40] <DatAsuna> Pat, eat a human effigy
[2:46:43] <+NWR_James> Spaghetti cat told me Elmo love Spaghetti
[2:46:45] <Silly_Duckling> She'll find a way
[2:46:46] <+linSP> HOW DID SHE GET A +2
[2:46:49] <worldbrand> the cat ring didnt save her from that fall haha
[2:46:51] <$Sphincter_Spelunker> it's not a phobia, it's bigotry

[2:56:05] <%QueequegTheater> IKEA is great, I love putting that shit together
[2:56:06] <+Jaysky> IKEA = Relationship death
[2:56:08] <%spiritofmojave> Ikeas breed resentment

[2:56:14] <cureneckbeard> Did Paige try to buy a wardrobe that Pat is too short to reach the top shelf?
[2:56:15] <+imthinkingdarbys> I worked at Ikea for 5 years
[2:56:15] <CloniiCory> IKEA sucks. I once tried to get a single lamp and it took like 3 hours.

[2:56:31] <T_Sasquatch> I went to an ikea for the first time and legitimately got so lost i started to actually panic

[2:56:32] <PunishedMercer_> just dig up tho
[2:56:32] <+Jontman42> Infinite furniture
[2:56:33] <$Sphincter_Spelunker> I had no idea Ikea had food for the longest time
[2:56:33] <+Jaysky> Isn't IKEA going out of business?
[2:56:33] <thegostofjon> only go to ikea IF youre both drunk
[2:56:36] <Grandma_Amari> My favorite SCP is still the one that's just an infinite IKEA.
[2:56:37] <+JavaManJoJo> My cousin went on a date to Ikea. She married the guy later
[2:56:37] <+Edrem> There is no escape from one another
[2:56:38] <worldbrand> Ikea visits have been my favorite dates
[2:56:38] <Frostydough1> i cant believe Pat curb stomped Paige at an Ikea
[2:56:38] <$lotharrio> You don't shop at Ikea, you suffer through it.
[2:56:38] <%spiritofmojave> It's like someone engineered the store to be one big queue
[2:56:39] <Crimpson> That is why you follow the arrows on the floor
[2:56:41] <%peachy996> Is IKEA some sort of trap room?
[2:56:41] <$Agami23> there is an SCP that is an endless repeating ikea with faceless workers who try to kill you.
[2:56:43] <%QueequegTheater> @peachsaliva that assumes I am willing to let someone else into my life besides my family
[2:56:44] <%TheSniperJoe> The closest my that I and my wife of 10 years have come to divorce, was assembling a fucking Ikea curio cabinet.
[2:56:47] <+imthinkingdarbys> it's not a maze its a single path
[2:56:50] <%zamatermort> You're just bad at Ikea
[2:56:51] <derap41> The Maze is there if you want to walk it you don't have to follow it
[2:56:52] <%ssjklyco> It's the only place that requires an RE style map
[2:56:53] <BeefyQueefer> livestream Paige going through a hedge maze.
[2:56:53] <%PerrinIsDead> I had a huge fight with my ex in a McDonalds parking lot and she got out of the car at 2 am to walk 20 miles home
[2:56:54] <%AncelDeLambert> those arrows are to confuse prey
[2:56:55] <%SvenHolgersson> Those arrows are LIES
[2:56:56] <SumKnowBuddy> BUT THE ARROWS ARE IN SWEDISH PAT
[2:56:59] <+unclekulikov> Repaint the arrows
[2:56:59] <T_Sasquatch> There were no arrowsss
[2:56:59] <Crimpson> It's not a maze if they tell you where to go
[2:56:59] <CloniiCory> It's a swedish prison.
[2:56:59] <DrkJP520> You'd think it would be fun cuz of the funny furniture names
[2:57:00] <%Tenchi_G> Spagets
[2:57:00] <Fien111> Ikea. Just some oak and some pine and a handful of Norsemen
[2:57:00] <a_mad_dragon> Pat, were you ever confused for the ikea monkey?
[2:57:02] <+Kiiper> Build the furniture without the manual live on stream
[2:57:02] <%SirGO0SE> its just like, its just like, its just like, a mini mall
[2:57:02] <%rumtumtugnutz> Ikea is an alien lifeform that is slowly leading you to your doom.
[2:57:08] <%Ez3z> Ikea is like a maze from Dennys that someone already solved for you
[2:57:08] <+Micalica> It is intentionally designed like a maze in order to MAKE you get lost and buy things.
[2:57:08] <Kemmybelle> I want one of those ikea plush sharks.
[2:57:09] <%zamatermort> Maze's don't have arrows and signs telling you where to go
[2:57:09] <cureneckbeard> My wife will never divorce me because she's two-dimensional
[2:57:10] <%arsonistdaria> one of those arrows leads to the Death Room
[2:57:11] <derap41> You don't have to follow those arrows
[2:57:13] <Sunstalker> It's a single path with no branches DansGame
[2:57:14] <%SvenHolgersson> If you can fuck on it buy it?

[2:57:20] <%SvenHolgersson> oh wait sorry nevermind
[2:57:24] <Ashenik1> Honestly this is more enjoyable than DS2
[2:57:25] <$lotharrio> If you don't want to follow the arrows and just leave an Ikea, it punishes you, like a child-god.
[2:57:27] <oniwahoo> The system works! Learn the system!
[2:57:27] <DjFrostBite95> smart rooH
[2:57:29] <derap41> Building IKEA furniture

[3:00:41] <YakumoYomi> Boobies and tits. My biology teacher loved using that joke when I was in high school.

[3:03:07] <%peachy996> That's how I avoided it
[3:03:08] <$Sphincter_Spelunker> see the problem with changing in the stall was that there was always one kid who took a massive shit
[3:03:09] <%GraceTBM> it's none of their business you know
[3:03:10] <tigress1208> tearBurn

[3:03:13] <Valdorick> The worst part
[3:03:14] <+Jaysky> Fair.
[3:03:14] <%TheSniperJoe> My generation grew up on Jackass, I became utterly immune to nudity because it was so common for dudes to just whip their balls out.
[3:03:14] <T_Sasquatch> @reclaimer087 big opposite dude. Women are extremely catty in general
[3:03:16] <Zaphire_Saucypants> Same here. Me neither.
[3:03:16] <%Dragon_Batman> Honestly that is super fair
[3:03:17] <LonePlus_> hi elmo
[3:03:18] <Valdorick> was the kids who would flop their dicks out
[3:03:18] <%Teintstein> It must be hard to fit on that tiny changing tray
[3:03:18] <@PlagueOfGripes> Remember when the teacher would spray you down with a water hose and be like, okay everyone make mooing noises now
[3:03:18] <BeefyQueefer> yeah i changed in the bathroom too, to protect the guy monster guys from my magnum dong
[3:03:19] <Jack_of_No_Trades> stranger nudity sucks
[3:03:19] <Valdorick> just cuz
[3:03:20] <+Etherealizer> my friends used to all pound it out to the same porno video in the same room together it was weird lol
[3:03:21] <Th1sisstan> at my middle school they didn't let us use the bathroom to change
[3:03:21] <dalishprince> thats valid
[3:03:22] <%TurtlesAndTentacles> I'm super insecure. been cheated on so many times I question if I'm good enought

[3:03:26] <%wsintai> You get used to it eventually
[3:03:27] <%vladhelsin> you would always get that one kid who ran around naked while screeching
[3:03:27] <+ThatGuyfromMars> I don't even wanna see myself naked
[3:03:28] <Sunstalker> We had communal and booths for changing at the swimming classes and it was entirely up to the teachers which we'd use.

[3:03:37] <%XeroSigmaPrime> Was on swim team, can confirm. We dont give a shit about nude
[3:03:37] <%peachy996> It's especially awkward when the coach gropes your nuts
[3:03:37] <+logoth_> Why do their weapons have evil gas on them
[3:03:38] <Daisuke89> @PeachSaliva I used to change in the restroom of the mens changing room in junior high. still dont change infront of others.

[3:09:18] <%ThePuddingDead> @PeachSaliva Paige...girls that have to deal with that shit, it's be expected and congratulated for, for boys? No support AT ALL and they have to figure that shit out themselves

[3:53:49] <tigerfang86> No :)
[3:53:49] <%Lunarhawk> @PeachSaliva in Peaches defense pate was like 2 years ago
[3:53:50] <ExhaustedHealer> that was last year pat
[3:53:50] <FatherGreyBeard> rats claimed the spiritual victory by reducing paige to tears
[3:53:55] <Simonator7x> she perceives memory differently
[3:53:55] <+Grayhammatter> no :)
[3:54:00] <MasterDecoder> @tigress1208 Yea, it was a moment
[3:54:03] <%shinydemonguy> remember patches?
[3:54:04] <JonKhan> I saw the clip now Im here
[3:54:05] <nawadap136> its been 84 years
[3:54:06] <%Keyd00d> She won't beat this game for another 5 years at this rate
[3:54:07] <+firmlygraspi1> I couldnt see Pate :)
[3:54:07] <$Agami23> he told you there was a treasure in a room and then closed a door on you
[3:54:09] <+WhereIsWill> its been 84 years
[3:54:10] <tigerfang86> actually last year
[3:54:12] <DamnGoodCake> To be fair, She met Pete like 2 years ago
[3:54:14] <Hellarussian> YEYEYEYEYEYEYE
[3:54:17] <%spiritofmojave> fast! yeah....
[3:54:18] <+Grayhammatter> REAL FAST
[3:54:20] <DedlokPM> psaWhat "Do you remember Pate?" "No. mogsSmeel "
[3:54:23] <cardboardboots> i dont know if its just me but every time i find him and pate fighting pate just destroys him
[3:54:28] <%Lizard0TM> IT'S NOT A YEAR LONG
[3:54:30] <%SoFarFetched> lewd
[3:54:30] <Sunstalker> It's the longest LP on the channel, no?
[3:54:32] <%Lunarhawk> @PeachSaliva All games are really long when you stream one night a month :)
[3:54:34] <%peachy996> You're not even halfway done
[3:54:35] <ScrubTheNerd> Fist pump is the best
[3:54:36] <%mighty_max_t> "You'll be seeing a lot more of this face"
[3:54:38] <%ha2ken> Now do it Paige
[3:54:42] <%Lizard0TM> Paige is just bad and slow!
[3:54:43] <derap41> Probably
[3:54:44] <%Keyd00d> With DLC yeah
[3:54:48] <%DesuDesuDokiDoki> KOTOR?
[3:54:49] <%Skelegroove> Kotor topped it didn't it?
[3:54:52] <CrimKangaroo> welp, gotta run. have a good night all
[3:54:55] <Ranryu692> it was KotOR with 99
[3:54:56] <%Lizard0TM> But that's okay
[3:54:57] <TonberryLives> KOTOR was
[3:54:59] <%ThePuddingDead> night
[3:54:59] <$lotharrio> Kotor stopped at 99.
[3:55:00] <%Keyd00d> Kotor is shorter counting DLC
[3:55:00] <+OdysseyKnight> Paige will qualify for a senior discount by the time this is done
[3:55:01] <skyentombment> WE DO IT
[3:55:04] <+cdrom321> Not longest. KOTOR. DS2 is second.
[3:55:05] <$Agami23> paige, you should use pats rooster teeth connections to get on the always open podcast
[3:55:10] <@commanderclaw> Even longer than KotoR
[3:55:17] <+blueragu47> I'm guessing she plans on doing the DLCs?
[3:55:20] <TonberryLives> No they didn't
[3:55:20] <%ssjklyco> No they didnt
[3:55:20] <CloniiCory> In fairness. I remember going through DS2 the summer I graduated High School...in 2014...Oh god....
[3:55:23] <2017y> no they didnt
[3:55:24] <$Niney_Who> NYOOM
[3:55:26] <2017y> lmao
[3:55:28] <%ssjklyco> It has 84 parts with the DLC
[3:55:32] <skyentombment> She qualifies for that discount already eeeeeeey
[3:55:32] <%Keyd00d> oh
[3:55:34] <%DesuDesuDokiDoki> Well, thats your fault for being a dummy then, isnt it?
[3:55:34] <%zorak100229> Fume Knight 2020
[3:55:35] <%Dragon_Batman> Yea I think so
[3:55:35] <%Keyd00d> nvm then
[3:55:35] <%GabeSweetMan> Yup
[3:55:35] <%peachy996> WRONG
[3:55:37] <$Sphincter_Spelunker> No, Paige should visit Funhaus and talk about Beast Machines with james
[3:55:38] <%spiritofmojave> 99 parts, yeah
[3:55:41] <Djinnazz> @Agami23 She'd kill them.
[3:55:41] <Zaphire_Saucypants> 99
[3:55:43] <%Keyd00d> Woolie is a slow boy
[3:55:44] <2017y> whats the longest duration wise tho
[3:55:45] <%DesuDesuDokiDoki> W O O L I E
[3:55:45] <%ha2ken> I still wish they had hit 100
[3:55:46] <Animorphimagi> Woolie
[3:55:46] <BeefyQueefer> Yea but Woolie played it
[3:55:46] <%Nobrev> REMEMBER TARIS
[3:55:47] <%GabeSweetMan> WOOLIE Pat. WOOLIE.
[3:55:47] <+firmlygraspi1> ECH
[3:55:47] <+patriotrenegade> Woolie
[3:55:48] <Sunstalker> Everytime Woolie gets to control the character LUL
[3:55:48] <$lotharrio> That first planet is like... 8 hours.
[3:55:49] <$Niney_Who> Woolie
[3:55:49] <Valdorick> And people mock Snailborne
[3:55:50] <Monkeyweed21> WOOLIE SPENT MULTIPLE EPISODES IN MENUS
[3:55:52] <%spiritofmojave> IT SHOULDVE BEEN 100 WOOLZ
[3:55:52] <Ranryu692> KotOR would've been 100 parts if the first one wasn't an hour long
[3:55:53] <%Dragon_Batman> I mean Woolie did take his time
[3:55:54] <thegostofjon> are you guys gonna play coop Baldurs Gate 3 when it comes out?
[3:55:55] <%GabeSweetMan> Woolie of the way of Menues
[3:55:58] <ExhaustedHealer> there is a reason kotor was the only lp i gave up on lol
[3:55:58] <Hydrapissed> monkaS
[3:55:59] <2017y> is kotor 15 minute episodes
[3:56:00] <%Smaenus> The true boss was Woolie fighting the menus
[3:56:00] <%Skelegroove> 30-45 hours
[3:56:03] <+cdrom321> It would've been 100, but you cheated and made 99 twice the length.
[3:56:05] <primaryfire> and yet Tokyo mirage sessions felt the longest
[3:56:07] <+RenoDeGeneric> Woolie on the sticks adds 30 episodes
[3:56:08] <BeefyQueefer> Woolie had the game set to pause after every combat round
[3:56:09] <%GabeSweetMan> Nice
[3:56:11] <%SirGO0SE> exploring eachothers asses Kreygasm
[3:56:11] <%peachy996> Maybe Pat was talking a lot
[3:56:13] <abelincoln_catpuncher> @PeachSaliva tbf you guys went through a LOT of side dialogue not to mention your shenanigan discusions
[3:56:14] <Zombrocom> Yeah, exploring menus
[3:56:18] <BeefyQueefer> he's doing Kotor2 faster though
[3:56:20] <@commanderclaw> 45 hours with Woolie
[3:56:21] <%peachy996> I don't remember KOTOR
[3:56:26] <primaryfire> skeleton_warrior.mp4
[3:56:27] <$Agami23> woolie was exploring the idea of the dark side
[3:56:28] <leothewhitelion> Woolie literally spent multiple episodes staring at the menu screens
[3:56:28] <@commanderclaw> Thank fuck for Lil V
[3:56:31] <Zombrocom> SKELETON WARRIORS
[3:56:31] <skyentombment> Oh man, time for the coolest, albeit easiest boss
[3:56:31] <%zamatermort> You put Woolie on control, of course it took ages
[3:56:32] <+patriotrenegade> SKELETONN
[3:56:32] <$lotharrio> Also like a fifth of Kotor is Woolie staring at pause menus.
[3:56:36] <themagic_conch> its almost time

[3:56:47] <+Blargimazombie> owo so sweepy
[3:56:48] <+AntithesisEK> sounds like Gatlinburg
[3:56:49] <vivaciouseff> disabling the real time combat system did no favors
[3:56:49] <cureneckbeard> Luckily Paige was a pro swimmer

[3:56:59] <Hydrapissed> monkaS monkaS monkaS

[3:57:05] <%nofestu2> was it gatlinburg in mid july?
[3:57:06] <@PlagueOfGripes> Gatlingburg has big hills
[3:57:07] <%peachy996> Paige your life is like a Dark Souls
[3:57:07] <+patriotrenegade> to buy crack

[3:57:30] <%Smaenus> Flask shard!
[3:57:30] <%GabeSweetMan> That was a bunch of upgrade items.
[3:57:33] <mrfreezepunsbestpuns> cheer500 hey Paige & Pat, now that Disney owns Disney Marvel and Disney Marvel owns the movie right to Disney X-men is there anything you're looking forwards to seeing?

[3:57:55] <YakumoYomi> She had that batch of bad ribs after the Gatlin Bros. concert and had Pat blow the door off that truck stop bathroom because she couldn't wait for the key.
[3:57:55] <+blueragu47> SPOOKS
[3:57:57] <DamnGoodCake> big worth
[3:58:02] <SkitsofRandom> @ssjklyco gatlinburg is a tourist spot, small town in the mountains built for vacationing with all your typical tourist trap stuff
[3:58:02] <Hellarussian> gotta find those emeralds
[3:58:03] <+AntithesisEK> Pigeon Forge is Silent Hill for KKona and Gatlinburg is budget disney.
[3:58:04] <MasterDecoder> @commanderclaw Fair enough

[4:09:20] <+patriotrenegade> like might as well screenshot of Earthen Peak
[4:09:20] <Goldenwolf98> LUL
[4:09:21] <Valdorick> Chest ahead, but horse
[4:09:31] <+its_a_mimic> Is this Donkey Kong jungle beat on dreamcast???????
[4:09:40] <+Tokanova> @its_a_mimic yes
[4:09:41] <rafaelba93> every time
[4:09:45] <primaryfire> her neck snaps if you use the dragon torso stone next to her smile
[4:09:52] <+its_a_mimic> fuck yea
[4:09:57] <$lotharrio> No.
[4:10:02] <2017y> shield is such a hilariuously bad idea
[4:10:03] <%Chichen> no
[4:10:08] <$lotharrio> Upgrading shields in this is bad.
[4:10:08] <falineth> still 74
[4:10:09] <$Sphincter_Spelunker> no
[4:10:09] <+firmlygraspi1> its at 100
[4:10:10] <tigerfang86> Probably not
[4:10:14] <Goldenwolf98> no never upgrade shields
[4:10:18] <2017y> upgrade armor :o
[4:10:19] <Zarkith> Non physical def goes up, so can't hurt?
[4:10:20] <%DesuDesuDokiDoki> does it go up later?
[4:10:20] <%Keyd00d> never
[4:10:21] <@commanderclaw> only non physical block
[4:10:23] <%Jekado> stability is at 74
[4:10:24] <$lotharrio> It does nearly nothing. You're better off boosting your armor instead.
[4:10:24] <CloniiCory> Upgrading shield is worthless.
[4:10:25] <+Tokanova> nnnnoooo
[4:10:25] <Berendenn> it just makes it block magic a bit better
[4:10:26] <Sunstalker> there's better shields anyway later
[4:10:26] <LeftOverPizza13> i don't remember any shields upgrading stability when upgrading them
[4:10:27] <+its_a_mimic> its the brain pain coach
[4:10:29] <SumKnowBuddy> pat.... you never upgrade shields
[4:10:30] <+Level10Biscuit> Do not.
[4:10:37] <Frostydough1> 3
[4:10:38] <%EyeFarted> STAB AT 74
[4:10:39] <JonKhan> Only if you got excess
[4:10:40] <$Sphincter_Spelunker> because you did that
[4:10:41] <cureneckbeard> why not upgrade shields
[4:10:41] <+Pookiedaexzile> Blackfscesmity
[4:10:42] <Sunstalker> Upgrade shields LAST if you need to
[4:10:42] <Bouerd> I think it does increase stability, just not every level
[4:10:43] <%spiritofmojave> Shield upgrades make such a minimal difference to everything but spell block
[4:10:45] <DamnGoodCake> waste of shards
[4:10:46] <Berendenn> upgrade shields last
[4:10:56] <%king_wragles> I think you upgraded it before to get 100 stability
[4:10:57] <rafaelba93> Sometimes upgrade shields
[4:10:59] <+its_a_mimic> how does he not know to never upgrade the shields
[4:10:59] <cardboardboots> stability upgrades every few levels for most sheilds
[4:10:59] <falineth> it maxes out at 78 but no improvement in this step
[4:11:01] <Monkeyweed21> only upgrade attack shields
[4:11:02] <%Jekado> havels has the highest stab?
[4:11:04] <%Jekado> i forget
[4:11:05] <%Dragon_Batman> It's already at 74
[4:11:06] <CloniiCory> You upgrade shields for flexing.
[4:11:06] <%Keyd00d> Waste
[4:11:08] <cureneckbeard> Upgrade shield shield last
[4:11:10] <$Sphincter_Spelunker> but it's not going up with the next one
[4:11:14] <Goldenwolf98> She barely uses it anyways so LUL
[4:11:19] <+holygodemperor> There is NO WAY pat is wrong
[4:11:23] <+jiggy_snipe> ,small improvements better to do other stuff
[4:11:26] <%Dragon_Batman> Shards and dust
[4:11:27] <+its_a_mimic> put all spuls into resist and shield
[4:11:28] <DamnGoodCake> no, you just burned shards last stream. It's not a huge deal.. but you have to use the shield for stability to matter XD
[4:11:29] <+calzonewithextracheese> you can upgrade resistance to certain ailements as well, it's not THAT bad...just not worth doing it now
[4:11:33] <%Lunarhawk> 2am time for food
[4:11:37] <%ThePuddingDead> considerable
[4:11:38] <$Sphincter_Spelunker> 1 progress
[4:11:40] <%zamatermort> Find clothes lady

[4:11:44] <%spiritofmojave> Pretty nice prog, woo
[4:11:46] <tigerfang86> you made some progress
[4:11:48] <CloniiCory> 2AM is the best time for food ngl.
[4:11:49] <%peachy996> Progess was made Rat was dead
[4:11:52] <+its_a_mimic> kill her
[4:11:55] <buerdo> People are dumb upgrading shields boost non physical resistance like magic or fire both things in the harvest valley
[4:11:56] <%Skelegroove> This game is gonna take forever
[4:11:58] <%SirGO0SE> im just now cracking the beers open tbh
[4:12:00] <%peachy996> Bones were beated

[4:14:51] <%SoFarFetched> @TheGrimmHuntsman you get it when you upgrade 8k worth of stuff and exhaust his dialogue
[4:14:52] <$Sphincter_Spelunker> she doesn't remember
[4:14:52] <%Jekado> because she forgot
[4:14:53] <%Skelegroove> Titanite weapons levels are equal to 2 normal levels. They have worse scaling generally
[4:14:54] <@PlagueOfGripes> his daughter's tits are enormous
[4:14:58] <%spiritofmojave> tell her you jerk!
[4:14:59] <tigerfang86> HUGE tits

[4:15:00] <%Lunarhawk> same plague
[4:15:03] <DamnGoodCake> yup
[4:15:06] <%TheFilth> tits hehe
[4:15:08] <@PlagueOfGripes> which has no bearing on her character or skill, but whatever
[4:15:10] <%DesuDesuDokiDoki> @PlagueOfGripes he proud daddy
[4:15:10] <falineth> craftsman looks better unless the move set is worth it
[4:15:13] <tigress1208> mcatLit mcatLit mcatLit
[4:15:19] <derap41> That hammer isn't as good
[4:15:19] <TheGrimmHuntsman> I mean I just wanted her to know about their relationship. That was it.
[4:15:22] <rafaelba93> power stance them
[4:15:23] <DamnGoodCake> upgrade it!
[4:15:23] <%Lunarhawk> hammer is heavy
[4:15:24] <%BaronVonMagpie> goddamn It JUST DID FAN ART WITH THE PREVIOUS HAMMER
[4:15:25] <$Sphincter_Spelunker> the bigger the boobs, the less funny they are
[4:15:25] <%Lunarhawk> 70.4
[4:15:26] <Goldenwolf98> @PlagueOfGripes It makes her better for fan art tho Kappa
[4:15:28] <2017y> she just spent all her money on levles
[4:15:30] <+its_a_mimic> Castlevania season 3 tomorrow
[4:15:36] <+TopTieramisu> she's got a nice pair of tit..anites
[4:15:43] <+theobble> Giant tits provide no tactical advantage whatsoever
[4:15:44] <%ha2ken> Those swings seem beefy
[4:15:45] <DamnGoodCake> MAKE HAMMER BIG LIKE PAIGE
[4:15:50] <derap41> Other hammer is better
[4:15:55] <Goldenwolf98> Dual wield them to be super cool
[4:15:57] <2017y> shockingly it has the exact same moveset just like all the meaningless dozens of weapons in this game
[4:16:00] <+GuildmasterAhnonay> this hammer is bad
[4:16:04] <%Lunarhawk> she doesnt have enough
[4:16:05] <$Hylian726> I prefer craftsman's usually
[4:16:06] <%EyeFarted> PLUS 5
[4:16:13] <$Sphincter_Spelunker> drumsticks are rad
[4:16:18] <derap41> Other hammer is straight up better
[4:16:18] <$Sphincter_Spelunker> but not for paige
[4:16:19] <Sunstalker> You'll stunlock bosses into defeat
[4:16:21] <%Dragon_Batman> You can barley wield the one

[4:16:50] <+DinnerCalzone> You need to have 1.5 times the strength and dex requirements of the weapon to dual wield
[4:16:51] <tigerfang86> Where dog
[4:16:51] <rafaelba93> dual wielding them would outdamage everything really
[4:16:53] <$trustycoyote> where dog?1
[4:16:53] <2017y> it doesnt matter that smith's goes to +10 it matters how they compare at like +7 to +4 or +5, reasonable upgrade levels she can expect to be at soon / now

[4:20:43] <%Jekado> equip both because of scaling
[4:20:43] <Berendenn> theyre roughly equal
[4:20:44] <%Lunarhawk> theyre basically the same right now
[4:20:48] <%Lunarhawk> blacksmith will be better after next upgrade
[4:20:49] <ScrubTheNerd> Equip both and just compare AR in the stats
[4:20:50] <tigerfang86> basically equal rn
[4:20:50] <derap41> X
[4:20:52] <DamnGoodCake> much worse

[4:21:05] <%zamatermort> one-THIRTEEN
[4:21:06] <%SoFarFetched> Craftsman has more upgrades.
[4:21:06] <falineth> but that is +3 vs +6
[4:21:08] <+Dirtiest_Bag> power stance time!
[4:21:10] <%SoFarFetched> sorry I mean Blacksmith*
[4:21:10] <+DinnerCalzone> POWER STANCE
[4:21:17] <+Sir_Gawain_Lotsson> @falineth one is twinkling
[4:21:17] <agrippaarpeggio> actually boss weapons in this game are pretty darn good
[4:21:18] <tigerfang86> POWER
[4:21:18] <Goldenwolf98> DUAL WIELD IT MAKES YOU BIG AND COOL
[4:21:20] <tigerfang86> P O W E R
[4:21:21] <derap41> You should probably always have shield
[4:21:22] <%EuropanLamprey> powerstance
[4:21:22] <+jiggy_snipe> Paige drop your shield
[4:21:23] <Top_Lane_Duelist> phew i made it, what i miss
[4:21:26] <%DesuDesuDokiDoki> try it
[4:21:27] <%TheFilth> duel wield coward
[4:21:28] <falineth> ah ok
[4:21:36] <%king_wragles> @Top_Lane_Duelist the entire stream
[4:21:39] <%Dragon_Batman> They're really almost done
[4:21:40] <2017y> that is dual wield
[4:21:42] <+DinnerCalzone> Dual wielding is power stance
[4:21:45] <agrippaarpeggio> Just Black Crypt Sword and Roaring Halberd are enough for me to call Pat on bullshit
[4:21:47] <BlindGato> Does she have the stats for it
[4:21:47] <Goldenwolf98> Shields are for cowards dual wield if for BIG STRONG
[4:21:47] <%SoFarFetched> yeah all dogs are dead
[4:21:47] <$Sphincter_Spelunker> @Top_Lane_Duelist two easy bosses, and a whole lot of fall deaths
[4:21:48] <Monkeyweed21> need 15 dex to power stance
[4:21:51] <Top_Lane_Duelist> elmoonfire.jpg
[4:21:51] <%Lunarhawk> @PeachSaliva Blacksmith hammer puts you at 70.4%, need more equip
[4:21:52] <$lotharrio> @falineth Yeah but the +3 has a smaller upgrade tree, so its +3 is equal to a +6.
[4:21:59] <primaryfire> wield one in each hand and hold triangle. your stats need to be at least 1.5x of the requirements to power stance
[4:22:01] <vivaciouseff> 1.5x stats to dual wield
[4:22:06] <rafaelba93> they dont even need to be similar, sword a big axe can work
[4:22:07] <%EuropanLamprey> powerstance you dont use the shield anyway
[4:22:12] <cureneckbeard> ???

[4:22:23] <+its_a_mimic> max is playing yugioh right now this is better. i prefer digimon
[4:22:33] <mobiusnightshade> Power stancing is the DS2 meta. It's why the DS2 representatives in DS3, the Drang warriors, use power-stanced maces and spears respectively.
[4:22:35] <primaryfire> literally can't even post numbers with decimals because the bot thinks it's a li k

[4:53:12] <derap41> You've considered that for 2 years
[4:53:12] <ghostofsolomon> i remember pat offering to pay for that
[4:53:13] <%SoFarFetched> I think you look good in both.
[4:53:16] <+DEETRz> Lasik is really worth it
[4:53:17] <tusk102> @PeachSaliva YEARS
[4:53:20] <%XeroSigmaPrime> DO IT SOON PLZ
[4:53:20] <MasterCosmic> You put glasses on your ass/
[4:53:20] <%Jekado> i don't know my dad got lasik and he woke up with his eyes fucked up again
[4:53:22] <+axellogic> "I am going to the eye doctor" Paige says everyday for years
[4:53:22] <$Sphincter_Spelunker> You said that 6 months ago too
[4:53:22] <%VashyronM> In 6 month
[4:53:24] <%Dragon_Batman> You do you, I think you look good either way
[4:53:25] <%SirGO0SE> lies :)
[4:53:26] <$Agami23> michael jones got laziq
[4:53:26] <cureneckbeard> But Paige, lasik would require you to go to the eye doctor.
[4:53:28] <TheArrow_> apparently lasik smells bad
[4:53:29] <abelincoln_catpuncher> tbh @PeachSaliva you look fantastic with glasses imo
[4:53:30] <%realm_forge> We‚Äôve heard that before

[4:53:40] <%BaronVonMagpie> you can also get the other kind of lasik if youre not a good canidate
[4:53:40] <%mostundesired> Lasik's not permanent, by the way.
[4:53:40] <@PlagueOfGripes> "These say Z-Ray vision!" "Z-Ray much better. Two more than X!"
[4:53:41] <%Neo_Kaiser> Just wear big, thick square nerd glasses instead.
[4:53:41] <zamzoph> @PeachSaliva you might have keratoconus and not qualify for lasik
[4:53:41] <suikudo> @PeachSaliva Seriously dont do Lasik

[5:14:37] <%Jekado> should really ask your doctor about doing that
[5:14:38] <%Neo_Kaiser> Male birth control caused suicide and the media mocked men for it.
[5:14:41] <%Lunarhawk> The ultimate birth control is already being pregnant
[5:14:46] <%realm_forge> In rare it‚Äôs like the elevator scene from the shining

[5:16:08] <Viperwing999> cursive is easier for essay writing tho
[5:16:09] <%VashyronM> Cursive is useless
[5:16:16] <Viperwing999> smoother on your hand
[5:16:20] <MasterDecoder> Fuck Cursive in 2020
[5:16:23] <Viperwing999> also quicker to write
[5:16:26] <+Jontman42> Why learn to produce anything, just consume
[5:16:28] <$Sphincter_Spelunker> I haven't used cursive since they taught in 3rd grade
[5:16:35] <mobiusnightshade> Calligraphy is nice to look at, though.

[5:16:58] <+Karglin> I'm pretty sure I only remember how to write my name for signature sin cursive and that's it.
[5:17:02] <abelincoln_catpuncher> if you're old enough to watch a stream, cursive shouldn't matter to your academic grades???
[5:17:03] <rubbishbinge> cursive is easier because you don't have to take your hand off the paper
[5:17:04] <%GabeSweetMan> @PlagueOfGripes *slow clap*
[5:17:04] <%VashyronM> Someone at my job writes the sloppiest cursive and it takes 20 minutes to decipher his fucking writing

[5:48:20] <derap41> Bikers are nice usually
[5:48:23] <%GabeSweetMan> Have they loosened those restrictions in Catholicism?
[5:48:24] <+Karglin> There is only extremes with priest. There never seems to be any middle ground, hard core boring or hardcore insane.

[5:48:42] <rubbishbinge> Priests just gotta say whoopsy doopsy and they get a free card

[5:49:11] <AdmiralButtloaf> not in the real life
[5:49:14] <$Agami23> did you ever meet gus from rooster teeth?
[5:49:14] <srkAres> pat turns into ashes when he enters a church
[5:49:17] <cureneckbeard> I hear there's a loophole where if you start out as an Anglican, who can marry, then convert to Catholicism, you can keep your wife because divorce is forbidden.
[5:49:18] <%Dragon_Batman> It's nothing special
[5:49:21] <+WhereIsWill> get crossed up FOR THE LORD

[5:49:52] <%SoFarFetched> Would you consider them your Father figure?
[5:49:54] <$Sphincter_Spelunker> Catholic: Don't do the thing. Oh, you already did? Are you sorry? No? Good enough
[5:50:00] <Viperwing999> so priests can burst sin power?
[5:50:02] <+Jontman42> Plague LUL
[5:50:06] <YakumoYomi> So do priests get more powerful when they take their collars off?
