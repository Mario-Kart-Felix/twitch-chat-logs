[0:03:32] <~PeachSaliva> Im only going to reaad it later (pat)
[0:03:33] <iamalittleboat> chats are always horrible when undertale is being streamed, in my experience
[0:03:34] <%breakfastmegapowers> Heyo. Fanfic Warrior. Im still here, and its your fault for being so dang charming and fun.
[0:03:34] <+callmedutch1> Undertale is actually an excellent game to stream imo, so looking forward to this

[0:03:54] <+Skatedeandre> Yeah guys Paige is going in 100% blind
[0:03:56] <@Donutjulio> alright guys gonna shower, that'll give me a half an hour to spare before the game starts
[0:03:58] <+Ryuartyi_> Looking forward to this since people can't tell her where to go or what to do.
[0:03:58] <+SimplyPandaz> man i really hope this is a certain type of play through and not another certain type
[0:03:58] <ArgentUndaCova> Undertale is a terrible game to stream imo, so many backseating
[0:03:59] <%Keyd00d> (pat)

[0:09:34] <AzureDusk> @PeachSaliva Cakes and muffins are both baked food products. The difference between cakes and muffins is that a muffin is a form of bread; whereas a cake, which is much sweeter, is not. Cakes are the favorite dessert choice while muffins are served for breakfast. Cakes usually have frosting on them while muffins are never frosted.

[1:34:24] <+ChaosVulpes> Stare down your mom when she throws her fireballs at you

[1:34:52] <HanPaul> uggo boots huh. looks like there's a giant rubber band holding it together
[1:34:59] <%ssjklyco> You can't give away ugly boots. You have to trick them on someone
[1:35:00] <$FoxInABeret> "They're not really my style. You know, because I'm not a $5 whore."
[1:35:03] <not_machoman> The Forbidden Undertale, Belowass
[1:35:03] <thelaxinator> I'll be honest, I looked over at the hooker boots and thought "wow how did Paige break her leg?"
