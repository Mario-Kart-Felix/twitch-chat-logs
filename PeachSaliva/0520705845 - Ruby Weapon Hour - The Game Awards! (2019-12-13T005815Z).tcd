[3:24:29] <+Imn0tacop> vaping helps quit smoking because it's an easier way to lower the nic levels gradually. A lot of people do use it as an excuse, but it is something that we've been blanket saying "no IT'S WORSE without actually looking into it. You can't seriously make the claims you are about vaping because, not only is that based on any research, but there isn't enough research for you to even base any statements off of.

[3:45:45] <Shwepie> Nintendo clearly doesn't care about the VGAs if they aren't winning Game of the Year.
[3:45:46] <%walternatorz> wolf among us is badass
[3:45:47] <%Eiddew> yeah that sign is outside snow white'a apartment iirc? @PeachSaliva
[3:45:48] <+RealThiele> telltale corpse puppet
[3:45:49] <%dagreenpillow> so many ADS
[3:45:50] <$SparkAfterDark> Do not be optimistic right now, I don't want it.
[3:45:51] <Dementedpenguin> The Wolf Among Us is my favorite Telltale game. It was fun
[3:45:52] <%LymanAl> @fettsvett201 You are welcome, kind stranger
[3:45:52] <+AnIcedCoffee> The new Batman game was rumoured to get a trailer here and a few days ago Geoff and one of the devs were getting weird about it on twitter
[3:45:52] <Oxybe> Ikumi, Muppets, Reggie. that is your takeaway.
[3:45:53] <+TacticalRainboom> Half-Life Alyx is the big thing that got canceled
[3:45:54] <%Jack_of_No_Trades> that hellblade 2 trailer was cool
[3:45:54] <Neo_Kaiser> Paige is a Fable.
[3:45:54] <+badjojokes> WHY DIDNT THEY AT LEAST SAVE THE XBOX TILL THE END????
[3:45:54] <$JackalopeHerd> Half Life Alyx fell through
[3:45:55] <+ahdurian> Surgeon Simuloator 2 D:
[3:45:55] <%bettysharkface> I am very happy for Disco ELysium
[3:45:55] <$NoirePanzer> Smell that Bigby MUSK
[3:45:56] <%ssjklyco> I hope they fixed the engine
[3:45:56] <spiritofmojave> Tell Tale still gripping to life is the most surprising thing
[3:45:57] <%D3rrtyD4n> honestly, could one thing save that shit show?
[3:45:57] <+neodeltai> Thank you Paige and Pat for making that abomination enjoyable.
[3:45:57] <Dragon_Batman> Some surprises

[3:46:02] <%BallerSwagBro9k> But Telltale ganes are so fake
[3:46:03] <+MRJadeK> fuck im gonna smoke some weed
[3:46:03] <%SoFarFetched> 5 months during the Game Awards and honestly this was made better seeing you and Pat watching this with great commentary. Hope the next game reveal event is a lot better than....whatever this event was. Also which muppet would you date Paige?
[3:46:03] <WalkingErection01> Honest 1. happy Sekiro won and 2. Actually interested in Dark Alliance Because I played it on my ps2 as a kid
[3:46:05] <+corgisploots> They had to waste like 10 minutes on that dumb Apex 'call in' joke
[3:46:06] <%cureneckbeard> Bigby like the D&D spells
