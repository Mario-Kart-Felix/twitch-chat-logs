[0:29:22] <critiquequartz> i think there was a bet?
[0:29:25] <+XdaXcaptainX> bigger fingers = better ring value because it takes more gold to properly clad your sausage fingers.

[0:53:40] <devanmuse> @linSP Jacob's Staircase*
[0:53:41] <%KeiganOfAstora> Up and to the right
[0:53:42] <%skyentombment> Oh man, I'm so fucking chuffed I got the exact number of deaths right
[0:54:05] <+Freakin_Wolfy> is she just gonna brute force her way through the game again?
[0:54:08] <%KeiganOfAstora> This isn't that bad
[0:54:08] <boomstickery> Pat, give her a 3 weapon
[0:54:08] <Sunstalker> That was a woman, Pat. DansGame
[0:54:09] <ChungusQuest> So as they become married and psychologically intermingle, will Pat lose the ability to use words while Paige loses the ability to see colors?
[0:54:12] <%dekkitout> Stock IS liquid bone 🤔
[0:54:13] <+patriotrenegade> nice trade
[0:54:20] <%KeiganOfAstora> Guy behind you

[0:54:41] <NeonBleu> One-Hit Souls
[0:54:45] <$Sphincter_Spelunker> Pat was talking about dudes lighting themselves on fire in DS2, but I don't remember that

[0:55:27] <TheFramedWarlock> CRAZY TALK, ACTIVATE
[0:55:27] <doctor_be> she fell for it, almost pulled it off, and then died to that old trick again
[0:55:30] <samcast1> definitely better than before
[0:55:36] <%KeiganOfAstora> Get through that ambush and you reach your first shortcut door
[0:55:38] <%skyentombment> MMMMMM MEEE MMM
[0:55:39] <Finakala> @lol_red_ranger Charibert pls
[0:55:49] <SuperBloodWolfMoon> I remember that part being miserable playing as a mage
[0:55:51] <DrkJP520> Just relax and play
[0:55:56] <$Sphincter_Spelunker> she does have glasses right
[0:56:08] <thunka10> FINALLY!
[0:56:09] <linSP> she can sEE
[0:56:12] <CanadianAnimatorGuy> She probably misses her old glasses
[0:56:12] <EnvyLeviathan_> Smake EATER
[0:56:12] <ZenDragoon> @ZenDragoon is new here. Say hello! HeyGuys
[0:56:13] <TonberryLives> Hooray!
[0:56:13] <%Promessa_EX> just wait ill jthe encounter
[0:56:14] <+Shacklebox> Paige has eyes?
[0:56:15] <+patriotrenegade> She has to beat those two Grave Wardens at once tho
[0:56:16] <linSP> she can FIGHT
[0:56:16] <+Freakin_Wolfy> Do the glasses have lenses?
[0:56:17] <MileenaTheOni> She can FIGHT.
[0:56:18] <doctor_be> are you talking about "the hyena?"
[0:56:19] <%ergulor> maybe that's why she can't beat the watchers
[0:56:20] <CrimsonFox777> Did she guess the prescription though?
[0:56:22] <%KeiganOfAstora> She's not gonna have enough souls to buy Siegward's armor
[0:56:23] <Lancaster_H> can she see tho?
[0:56:31] <ChungusQuest> Make her hear so that she can see!
[0:56:48] <%king_wragles> Well, if Paige has her glasses on she should be able too hear the death noise just fine
[0:56:50] <+Dunmarkh> big lies
[0:56:54] <cloakofashes> She loves swinging her big mace around.
[0:56:56] <+Shacklebox> Paige takes PHAT hits
[0:56:57] <Dakuu75> This path sucks. Every 5 feet something appears behind you and they all want your butt
[0:56:58] <TonberryLives> UNGA
[0:56:59] <CyborgAV> Paige loves violence
[0:57:00] <%Paralurx> She enjoys VIOLENCE
[0:57:02] <unlawfulvagabond> all she needs to do for the npc is open the big door, a patch fixed it so you no longer need to reload the area.
[0:57:07] <%XdaXcaptainX> MANY BIG HIT
[0:57:10] <Finakala> Why does she need glasses if she's deaf
[0:57:12] <%Dingalow> Does Paige need ear glasses?
[0:57:13] <%skyentombment> Man, DS3 has a guilty pleasure for me where I start a build for like mage or dex guy, but I ALWAYS gravitate back to the Farron Greatsword even though it's shit for pvp
[0:57:14] <%walternatorz> so long as Paige doesn't read
[0:57:19] <+whyskeywolfe> It's the Jesus Everytime system!

[1:03:05] <cloakofashes> Because it's goo.
[1:03:07] <%Promessa_EX> or firebomb if you please
[1:03:08] <doctor_be> those specific enemies have stupidly high physical resist
[1:03:08] <%KeiganOfAstora> fire
[1:03:10] <%KeiganOfAstora> Weak to fire
[1:03:11] <%Raz_Pataz> or piercing
[1:03:11] <%Chichen> fire in particular
[1:03:13] <devanmuse> goo stronk! too stronk!
[1:03:14] <%Chichen> ye
[1:03:22] <lotharrio> Pummeling jello is tough. Burning is the smart.
[1:03:24] <peachy996> Its also in Bloodborne
[1:03:29] <%KeiganOfAstora> It doesn't do much
[1:03:30] <%Chichen> why do they have puking statues
[1:03:30] <Tracazoid> Life Final Fantasy Flans, physical sucks so blast'em with magic
[1:03:32] <%Ranryu692> hitting with blunt works on things that have bones. goo doesn't have bones
[1:03:32] <danknugglit> Uh oh stinky
[1:03:35] <Tracazoid> Like*
[1:03:35] <doctor_be> thats a pretty ingenious way to introduce that mechanic

[1:04:09] <%KeiganOfAstora> Manus was the shit
[1:04:12] <+hoenhime344> has paige been through the catacombs?
[1:04:16] <Slimeking_Mike> Take this L evator
[1:04:17] <%walternatorz> I can only hear Plague when Manus is described
[1:04:18] <+vehementvadr> nito was neater
[1:04:19] <linSP> yay pogress
[1:04:21] <chambatron> Hey Paige Woolie just retweeted that the Image about Lola with long legs and big tits is fanart
[1:04:21] <%Dingalow> Kinda wish the Dark Souls franchise wasn't milked so bad
[1:04:28] <MetalSlimeHunt> @thunka10 What's so funny about this normal Catholicism? Kappa
[1:04:32] <+RealThiele> double manus for ornstein in randomizer LUL
[1:04:38] <dumahiem> a Catholic joke I know of no job where a man's not expected to turn gay with so many people standing there waiting for a communion wafer with their mouth open
[1:04:52] <%Chichen> been a while huh
[1:04:54] <olaksi> @Dingalow It's really only DS2 that goes full fanservice
[1:04:56] <%thotbane> @Dingalow imagine how much worse ANY OTHER company would have milked it, or if MIyazaki didnt have executive level control
[1:04:57] <%Raz_Pataz> Paige doesn't live in the past
[1:05:06] <+g0atmeal> g0atmeal subscribed with Prime. They've subscribed for 15 months! 
[1:05:08] <%Chichen> itchy tasty

[1:05:16] <linSP> thats a wet hole 😳
[1:05:20] <%BoxNavy> remember bloodborne?
[1:05:20] <danknugglit> Grant us bloodborne 2
[1:05:22] <%KeiganOfAstora> Where in the game does it say that The Deep is water behind the cathedral?
[1:05:24] <Aydarkzero> shortcut!
[1:05:26] <+luftraumm1> is that really the deep?
[1:05:26] <thunka10> Apparently I can only make jokes about Cathlicism so someday we'll find out together @MetalSlimeHunt
[1:05:31] <LunarRemix> @olaksi You literally go to Firelink Shrine in this game, what are you talking about
[1:05:31] <MyNameIsRasus> wuss dat smell
[1:05:32] <doctor_be> It doesnt Keigan
[1:05:37] <%KeiganOfAstora> Thouoght so
[1:05:39] <Dakuu75> can't believe bloodborne never got a 60 fps fix, even after the ps5 came out ffs
[1:05:41] <EnvyLeviathan_> @PeachSaliva is praying to a sinkhole really worth it though
[1:05:41] <danknugglit> ITZ BLUUD
[1:05:45] <%KeiganOfAstora> Pat making shit up agai
[1:05:45] <+lordericter> has she talked to the well yet I don't remember since its been 2 months
[1:05:50] <%thotbane> @KeiganOfAstora it's a fan theory that that pond is like, an emanation of the Deep. a naturally atttuned spot
[1:05:52] <%XdaXcaptainX> you can tell they tried real hard with dks3 shortcuts for like 1/5th of the game
[1:05:54] <LunarRemix> @olaksi Firelink, Lost Izalith and a couple of more DS1 locations
[1:06:02] <%KeiganOfAstora> Fair enough
[1:06:04] <%XdaXcaptainX> and then gave up and scattered free bonfires to the winds
[1:06:05] <olaksi> @LunarRemix I wouldn't call callbacks in asequel "milking it"
[1:06:07] <%thotbane> @KeiganOfAstora because that one Evangelist looking out at it, who drops the Deep Gem
[1:06:12] <Parapattern> Smoke a soul like a blunt
[1:06:13] <%Raz_Pataz> I mean 90% of souls lore is headcannon so Pat's statement isn't all that false
[1:06:14] <%KeiganOfAstora> Many souls to buy Catarina Set
[1:06:23] <%Treuan> he nor
[1:06:23] <%Promessa_EX> or just kill
[1:06:29] <doctor_be> to save the best boy

[1:06:34] <doctor_be> Onionlad
[1:06:37] <hairtoday> can't hear dognoise
[1:06:48] <olaksi> Compared to DS2 where the callbacks make zero sense
[1:06:49] <Aydarkzero> but that's what makes it fun!
[1:06:50] <NiftyNox> BEEG
[1:06:50] <cloakofashes> Okay, time to meet the giant friend.

[1:07:07] <Aydarkzero> good try though
[1:07:07] <Mirrorcatch> all lore is made up, even real life is made up
[1:07:08] <%Dingalow> I just don't think Dark Souls should have been a franchise in general tbh, but even so, they could have at least been entirely self-contained games
[1:07:09] <%ergulor> doge
[1:07:09] <%TheWinged7> M O R T I S
[1:07:10] <doctor_be> this part legitimately fucked me for awhile

[1:07:18] <MyNameIsRasus> HE MADDD
[1:07:22] <Lutre> he angy
[1:07:23] <@commanderclaw> He's sitting in shit, of course he's mad
[1:07:24] <+patriotrenegade> You come into HIS house
[1:07:25] <cloakofashes> He's huge and stuck in goo.
[1:07:25] <%XdaXcaptainX> hes angry because he lives in a pool of his own poop
[1:07:28] <%walternatorz> he is threatened by how big and strong Paige is
[1:07:28] <doctor_be> they had to build the cathedral around him
[1:07:28] <Aydarkzero> it made him strong
[1:07:29] <+patriotrenegade> With THOSE shoes!
[1:07:29] <thunka10> Mad because Big, Big because mad FeelsBadMan
[1:07:29] <adayuman> imagine the souls universe under the creative control of someone like ed boone
[1:07:30] <unlawfulvagabond> if you have enough hp you can drop off the ledge and attack his ankles
[1:07:31] <+thelonechris> Diarrhea makes you stronger
[1:07:31] <Ziegsy> F E R T I L I Z E D
[1:07:34] <NiftyNox> the secret of the gods
[1:07:35] <danknugglit> "Time is convoluted or whatever fuck you" -miyazaki
[1:07:35] <MyNameIsRasus> He was molded by it
[1:07:36] <linSP> living in poop will make you big
[1:07:36] <Parapattern> That's why Paige is so big
[1:07:37] <+robosqueeb> His cracked giant feet soak up all the nutrients
[1:07:37] <%ssjklyco> Then why is pat small
[1:07:37] <%XdaXcaptainX> lashing out at you is his only release in life
[1:07:37] <%FacetiousAF> that explains pat
[1:07:38] <Lancaster_H> thats why paige is so big and strong
[1:07:39] <%Chichen> ... is that how Zangief is growing?
[1:07:39] <%Dingalow> Just slapping on a timeline to Dark Souls made the universe a messs
[1:07:42] <%KeiganOfAstora> LUL

[1:07:46] <+RealThiele> grow fast to get out of the shit
[1:07:46] <ShichiNoBushi> Is that why Pat is so short? Because he never shat his pants?
[1:07:47] <MetalSlimeHunt> ???
[1:07:47] <+prisefighter1188> me an my bro have been running through ds3 and we've made it to irythill

[1:08:09] <linSP> dog nut
[1:08:11] <dumahiem> no he's huge because he's sitting down and doing nothing eating rats and not exercising plus he's got the souls
[1:08:13] <Parapattern> Paige lives in that nourishing Pat poop
[1:08:17] <+patriotrenegade> I think the giant just ate a lot of people and got lots of humanity and thus grew huge
[1:08:19] <+blastazoid00> Spite nut

[1:09:37] <%thotbane> @Dingalow Something about a cut zone, "God's Grave" and they had to shuffle around a bunch of bosses. Grundyr's model was supposed to be Oceiros, i think. Wolnir and Yhorm were swapped in place,

[1:12:45] <ArkSeaside> I once had a Gelatinous Cube the size of a city. It had dragons in it
[1:12:47] <+Fooguwu> why this way tho
[1:12:48] <MileenaTheOni> They're more like Black Puddings, but same family of monsters.

[1:13:08] <MetalSlimeHunt> My party once cast Shatter on a Gelatinous Cube when someone was inside it LUL
[1:13:09] <ShichiNoBushi> They are also transparent and nearly invisible, so adventurers have a tendency to walk straight into them.

[1:13:16] <danknugglit> You mean pat?
[1:13:18] <%AncelDeLambert> probably should grab Paige the dirt-basic pyromancy for those things

[1:14:41] <darklurker_dumahiem> all the smooches
[1:14:42] <+Encrouched> missed opportunity to not have a weapon called the "bear mace"
[1:14:43] <MetalSlimeHunt> Literally hundreds
[1:14:43] <NiftyNox> 9
[1:14:44] <MyNameIsRasus> 20 at best
[1:14:45] <xxshadowxx416> run
[1:14:46] <$vile_brand> 9 minimum
[1:14:46] <ArkSeaside> has Paige encountered the Ceiling Friend Evillak yet
[1:14:47] <Oxybe> Mace is a good boi. they put in the work to support their family.
[1:14:47] <%Promessa_EX> 8-10
[1:14:47] <$Sphincter_Spelunker> Hey, since humanity is gone, what do the La Parkas steal with their hand grab?
[1:14:48] <linSP> BEST dlc
[1:14:49] <sydowoodo> 12; paige's favorite number
[1:14:49] <+whyskeywolfe> Years.
[1:14:50] <%thotbane> @ArcanumArcanum what if some oozes were not that acidic that they'd hurt humans and are a delicacy
[1:14:55] <+prisefighter1188> forever
[1:14:57] <primaryfire> the dlc is good in all of em
[1:14:58] <+Freakin_Wolfy> Let's all thank the person who is helping paige the most in this playthrough: Vordt
[1:15:06] <%Promessa_EX> the sword ring is fun times
[1:15:07] <linSP> ds2 had great dlc that paige did not do btw
[1:15:09] <+patriotrenegade> Ashes of Ariendel isnt great
[1:15:13] <%Monkeyweed21> HEAL
[1:15:15] <%KeiganOfAstora> no
[1:15:16] <Lancaster_H> Woolie will finish the entire Arkham series before Paige finishes this
[1:15:17] <%Dingalow> Good job taking care of him
[1:15:19] <+Encrouched> become big item, become giantem
[1:15:23] <darklurker_dumahiem> in need of....lube
[1:15:24] <+robosqueeb> not good for heavy folks
[1:15:25] <%Promessa_EX> if you can keep your health topped off
[1:15:25] <%KeiganOfAstora> The other items are soul items
[1:15:26] <EuropanLamprey> Better than what you have now
[1:15:27] <+b_aleph> Who's Lloyd?
[1:15:29] <Clundy> Big boy smash
[1:15:30] <$Sphincter_Spelunker> Wendy's Nuts
[1:15:31] <MyNameIsRasus> ashes of ariandel has a sick final boss tho
[1:15:37] <+thelonechris> By the time we get to the end boss, Paige and Pat's kid will be going into college
[1:15:40] <ArkSeaside> Gwyn's Uncle
[1:15:41] <%Promessa_EX> lloyd is a dude that likes 1v1's
[1:15:43] <%dekkitout> Allfather Lloyd, aka Gwen's uncle
[1:15:44] <+patriotrenegade> Reggie will beat Dark Souls before Paige beats Dark Souls 3
[1:15:45] <Sunstalker> linSP We'd still be playing ds2 in 2024 then if she played those
[1:15:45] <%Raz_Pataz> oof
[1:15:47] <+Fooguwu> use it her rings suck
[1:15:48] <NiftyNox> Tbh if they made the Ringed City into a full game setting of its own I think that would have been a fantastic ending
[1:15:49] <+robosqueeb> ohh i whats the atk up when low weight ring
[1:15:49] <+patriotrenegade> It sucks
[1:15:50] <%Monkeyweed21> Lloyd Rroyd
[1:15:51] <primaryfire> the only critique I've ever seen of ashes of ariandel is that it's short, but that doesn't make it not-good
[1:15:55] <danknugglit> Its rtsr for babies
[1:15:58] <%XdaXcaptainX> doesnt she still have no real rings tho
[1:16:01] <+Encrouched> health full, clown'll eat me
[1:16:01] <%KeiganOfAstora> @patriotrenegade Holy shit you're right
[1:16:03] <ArkSeaside> nah Ariandel is kinda sucks
[1:16:07] <%XdaXcaptainX> plus it gurentees good hits after a chug
[1:16:14] <EuropanLamprey> It's better than Flynns ring she's wearing now which does literally nothing for her
[1:16:19] <darklurker_dumahiem> Alll father LLoyd looks like Christopher LLoyd.......dressed as uncle fester
[1:16:21] <Lancaster_H> wht rings u got bithc
[1:16:22] <thunka10> One (1) Ring of Engagement
[1:16:26] <+Fooguwu> 50 AR baby
[1:16:26] <moonlitdream> Lloyd's Ring is essential for beating the game at Soul level 1
[1:16:27] <$Sphincter_Spelunker> red
[1:16:27] <+patriotrenegade> bithc
[1:16:31] <$NumeroHoowan> don't think ariandel's bad. just underwhelming
[1:16:32] <DrkJP520> That ring is pointless for you Paige, and in the game too
[1:16:34] <+TheotherKristian> Ashes is great for that boss, primarily
[1:16:37] <$thomassolorio> We'll need lots of wood Need lots of leaves Need lots of paint But hush hush hush hush hush... Let's be quiet as a mouse And build a lovely little house For Wendy Oh for Wendy She's come to stay
[1:16:39] <linSP> blue shit is underrated
[1:16:45] <ArkSeaside> tits *are* fine too, thanks paige
[1:16:47] <MyNameIsRasus> @patriotrenegade man i'm really hyped up for reggie vs dark souls, that des lp was sick
[1:16:48] <+Encrouched> lloyd's is useless for everyone
[1:16:49] <%Chichen> Chichen subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 23 months, currently on a 23 month streak! Nearly 2 years! Wow! Elden Ring may be out by the time you finish this game, but that'll just be good timing! Congrats on da engagement! Happy for you both!
[1:16:52] <+patriotrenegade> blue tearstone is actually pretty good, its saved me from death A LOT
[1:16:52] <%dekkitout> I like the false hope/confidence that ring gives
[1:16:55] <%baronblank> just watch him to tell when to dodge
[1:16:56] <$Sphincter_Spelunker> bye full health buff
[1:16:59] <EuropanLamprey> Lloyd is useful if you know how to ring swap
[1:17:01] <Clundy> Isn’t Ariandel that city from Frozen? Kappa
[1:17:01] <%KeiganOfAstora> HEAL
