[2:58:36] <Dragon_Batman> Nah she is fast gurl
[2:58:37] <duke0fspook> She's not Talim slow
[2:58:38] <+Hilleltaco> Taki, known slowest character in Soul Calibur
[2:58:38] <IdiotWithADHDGamer> Taki is a very slow ninja.
[2:58:38] <thetruenicster> she's not slow
[2:58:41] <pillowwasp> taki is the slowest fighting game character
[2:58:44] <ECRead> Taki... is NOT slow...
[2:58:51] <Rhinoprotoss> you're slow
[2:58:51] <mostundesired> WHAT THE FUCK DO YOU MEAN SLOW
[2:58:53] <+sana_kan> she is not slow lol

[2:58:55] <pectusumbra> does she still have that gut stab?
[2:58:56] <duke0fspook> Nope
[2:58:56] <suikudo> She is one of the fastest
[2:58:56] <%Remery_> can't button mash with her
[2:58:57] <+Nobody404> "She's slow" as she fights Astaroth
[2:58:57] <benjiFG> baku
[2:58:58] <%AncelDeLambert> Taki combos like crazy
[2:59:01] <laserbeaming> Astaroth is the slow boy here
[2:59:01] <+Nomicro4u> Taki is one of the harder characters to use imho
[2:59:05] <Dio_TR> you're too slow- Sonic
[2:59:06] <+HanPaul> Talim is pretty fast
[2:59:07] <CriticKitten> Is Crazy Talk activating on Paige's words now too?
[2:59:09] <%JenovasPuppet> Jeez that costume destruction
[2:59:10] <tank7013> Damn
[2:59:11] <mostundesired> SICK
[2:59:12] <+NuclearLawlocausto> It's a range thing, I think
[2:59:12] <+Hilleltaco> Love that grab
[2:59:13] <Tisaric> god Astaroth is great
[2:59:14] <pectusumbra> hehehehe
[2:59:15] <%Fruitywhompus> CRONCH
[2:59:16] <zamzoph> JUST WALK LUL
[2:59:20] <ArtThouBored> You're thinking of range
[2:59:25] <+NuclearLawlocausto> Ivy can attack from farther away more quickly
[2:59:26] <pectusumbra> Damn, I want to see Ivy do that move.
[2:59:30] <$Sphincter_Spelunker> Paige nutting over big beefy two handing man
[2:59:31] <Firesparks> is female astaroth in this game?
[2:59:31] <HyperBomb21> @PeachSaliva Taki is a hard character to use
[2:59:32] <Jeter98> your doing her all of her slow moves and the jumping is just adding alot more time before your move comes out
[2:59:37] <TranquilTurnip> You gotta get in reeeaal close
[2:59:37] <+SleepyFranke> Honestly Paige should just be Astaroth. LIke it's the most HER character ever
[2:59:39] <$ThePuddingDead> Femmestaroth?
[2:59:41] <ArtThouBored> Ivy has more Taki has less
[2:59:45] <+clifin> Is the stone background real?
[2:59:48] <+clifin> or is a green screen?
[2:59:52] <+Hilleltaco> THE MIXUPS
[2:59:52] <fairore> taki is one of the fastest characters right now

[3:00:01] <@CreepyPorpoise> Yeah, try out one of the uggo dudes and if you like it, create a character yourself as them
[3:00:01] <waifoong98> They just have different specific buttons Paige
[3:00:03] <%GarbageNirvana> It kind of amazes me she doesn't go for big and strong tbh
[3:00:04] <%JenovasPuppet> @clifin It's real
[3:00:06] <+clifin> it looks like a goddamn dungeon
[3:00:08] <mostundesired> Oh shit, once Paige gets the concept, she can kick ass.

[3:01:09] <Melchior_the_Wise> Pat, how does it feel to know that with a few weeks of practice, Paige will continuously beat you?
[3:01:11] <Arek_1> SHA!
[3:01:16] <+NuclearLawlocausto> @PeachSaliva Taki is also a rather hard to use character by Soul Calibur standards
[3:01:16] <+DestroyerPhoenix> is pat aware that the reversal edges lower the guard stamina or does he just think he can get away with it
[3:01:25] <TheMilhouseExperience> Pat with Asteroth means BIG BLOWUP!
[3:01:25] <$jorgamund> when did astaroth get a snake necklace?
[3:01:26] <%GarbageNirvana> He's like a big ol' axe Frankenstein

[3:02:03] <%ss_goku2> ivy might be better for her in this matchup
[3:02:03] <+DestroyerPhoenix> i think you can just make him purple in the editor pillowwasp
[3:02:03] <%GarbageNirvana> You can probably make purple Astaroth in customization
[3:02:07] <MrPedrovsky> Does Geralt has his canon moveset from witcher so you can just play witcher but in soul calibur? He is the only thing that makes me want to actually play a fighting game for the first time in my life
[3:02:07] <subjectg> just use 22B pat
[3:02:07] <+Walopoh> (Poopy Noises)
[3:02:12] <%Remery_> He has so many grabs

[3:03:07] <+Walopoh> Haven't watched the stream in a while, whats with the dungeon wall? thanks
[3:03:08] <Melchior_the_Wise> while pat picks the big easy characters
[3:03:09] <%graffitisamurai> good grab
[3:03:10] <+Karebuncle> its the wind up, she has an awkward wind up
[3:03:15] <Belutima> @mrpedrovsky yes, its very accurate, even some new moves
[3:03:16] <subjectg> she did used to be faster
[3:03:17] <CaramelTaffy> missing all the cool moves
[3:03:17] <%graffitisamurai> USE YOUR SUPER
[3:03:18] <duke0fspook> To be fair Astaroth is no nightmare in terms of complexity
[3:03:19] <mostundesired> Oof, big clipping htere.
[3:03:20] <Rhinoprotoss> Does Pat not know how to play Astaroth?
[3:03:25] <HannibalBeerus> "Range, thats what I was thinking of" "She has this awkward slow thing where I have to be close"

[3:03:50] <mr_slaide> Tiddies.
[3:03:51] <LiquidMathew> "Now I'm Motivated"

[3:03:52] <+DestroyerPhoenix> oh no my big shoulderpads
[3:03:52] <$Sphincter_Spelunker> That mask is really terrible.
[3:03:52] <Arek_1> @mrpedrovsky Geralt has moves with both the Steel Sword and Silver Sword. Steel Sword has orange weapon trails, Silver Sword has blue weapon trails.

[3:05:59] <+HanPaul> pro Seigfried is fun to watch
[3:06:00] <+nolifegamin> Maxi is good for mash, hard for actually fighting for reals
[3:06:02] <%GarbageNirvana> Er, SC
[3:06:04] <+SlugNut> Wait Maxi is easy now? I thought he was one of the harder ones
[3:06:12] <%ZebraFace> Elmo wish to play

[3:06:20] <NooblettOfWar> Maxi.. mash with rhyme
[3:06:23] <Melchior_the_Wise> No, Maxi has always been beginner level
[3:06:24] <$ShoHayabusa> And there goes the bullshit LUL
[3:06:30] <sileo_patronus> Nice patience at the start there
[3:06:32] <umm_idunno> maxi is hard but mashing is pretty effective against scrubs
[3:06:33] <Ninjagregory98> Boo
[3:06:33] <Jeter98> maxi isnt easy, but he is button masher friendly
[3:06:34] <Melchior_the_Wise> he combos so easily
[3:06:37] <tank7013> @SlugNut I think the game refers to him as "intermediate"
[3:06:37] <mercado94> do a waveshine
[3:06:42] <$ShoHayabusa> LUL she getting it.
[3:06:46] <+DrunkenDice> Keep mashing it out paige!
[3:06:47] <laserbeaming> Maxi is super hard to play for real. Too many stances, hard to tell which one you are in. Almost all your attacks leave you in a stance

[3:07:45] <$ShoHayabusa> OOOh with the block
[3:07:45] <MrPedrovsky> @arek_1 derped for a moment, thought you meant some SC specific mechanic, meant as the person who played all games to a 100% and read all books and stuff to not only go “i clapped when i saw/did it” but also to just pick it up on a decent level by knowledge of witcher but absolutely zero experience in the fighting games, since his appearance in this game is the only thing that makes me want to buy a fighting game for the first time
[3:07:46] <%graffitisamurai> nice parry
[3:07:47] <+Nobody404> footsies master
[3:07:48] <%JenovasPuppet> Break out the fight sticks

[3:07:52] <CaramelTaffy> Ah yes Maxi aka the Eddie Gordo
[3:07:54] <$SleepyMaribo> wonder how'd she do with a fight stick, would it be easier on her wrists?

[3:11:50] <mostundesired> DENIED
[3:11:56] <$joylent_blue> his super is so boring
[3:11:57] <Dragon_Batman> At low health he gets buff, you can spend it by doing foward A+B
[3:11:59] <+Kirbachev> This looks good, but fuck that pricetag.

[3:12:30] <CheetosMascot_TM> I started with Tira, is she really bad?
[3:12:32] <Arek_1> @mrpedrovsky Ah, it's ok. I only have a surface knowledge of The Witcher. Geralt's fighting style here is just as spinny and twirly as he is in his games. He has a few spells and for his power up, he drinks some special potion. I know that's some power up in the games, too. Pretty faithful and, honestly, Geralt fits well in Soul Calibur VI.

[3:46:03] <fmc009> overhyped how? everyone who has watched it hates it xD
[3:46:04] <blackbookalpha> read the manga
[3:46:04] <T_Sasquatch> you people dont know EDGY
[3:46:06] <+Arkfyre> It's fine. Just watch it.
[3:46:07] <$TheSniperJoe> Goblin Slayer isn't even that edgy...Berserk had a WAAAAY more fucked up rape scene in it and no one complained.
[3:46:07] <AlasterAngelo> goblin slayer is fine
[3:46:07] <element_of_loyalty> TWEET
[3:46:08] <+SolidusRex> Goblin Slayer is cool

[3:46:11] <DaGodKira> GOBBO SLAYER IS GOOD PAIGE YOULL LIKE IT
[3:46:14] <Bouldus> yea goblin slayer is a little edgy, and it is overhyped, but so is every anime thats recommended
[3:46:14] <T_Sasquatch> a 5 second rape scene isnt edgy
[3:46:15] <Tophat12> Goblin Slayer lightens up after episode 1
[3:46:21] <%ZebraFace> I'm swimming in hand sanitizer
[3:46:21] <%Kravedarknesss> it's not terrible. the first episode just wasn't what people expected

[4:08:45] <$ThePuddingDead> it kinda is
[4:08:45] <viewtifulr> nope
[4:08:47] <JaydenSai> Reminder that Garth Merengi's Dark Place is on Youtube now @PeachSaliva
[4:08:48] <+Isthajore> Shizune was nice in concept. Her execution was horrid.
[4:08:49] <+cvp5127> kinda
[4:08:50] <AlasterAngelo> yes
[4:08:51] <fmc009> It's DnD but taken seriously???
[4:08:51] <TheMilhouseExperience> It's really tame by ep3
[4:08:52] <topendbuzz> its just dnd
[4:08:53] <+robert_edwards> don't watch Goblin Slayer.
[4:08:55] <%crowsloft77> it's D&D
[4:08:56] <element_of_loyalty> ST BERNARD PUPPLES
[4:08:56] <%JenovasPuppet> How is elmo still such a kitty?
[4:08:57] <%Tarviti> Heavily DnD inspired
[4:08:57] <suikudo> @PeachSaliva Just watch the first episode and you will understand
[4:08:58] <Basch71> they have dnd spread sheets
[4:08:58] <Bouldus> @PeachSaliva goblin slayer is DND but everyones a murder hobo, and has very little personality
[4:08:58] <%audrus> Goblin slayer is literally just a guild anime with r***
[4:08:59] <Credfield_> How much big money you fuck Big huge money
[4:09:00] <+SolidusRex> It IS DnD
[4:09:00] <+Arxel1> Its straight up DnD
[4:09:03] <%Keyd00d> just read berserk
[4:09:04] <$Ninjas_With_iPods> Dnd
[4:09:04] <$mandragoraroot> PogChamp
[4:09:04] <AlasterAngelo> the premise is that its literally a game of DnD
[4:09:05] <viewtifulr> it tries to be overlord but its not
[4:09:05] <$TheSniperJoe> Goblin Slayer is like a D&D game run by the edgiest GM you've ever met and one of the players is a half mute sociopath.
[4:09:06] <$ThePuddingDead> like everyone has spells with a certain number of uses per day and they bring attention to that
[4:09:07] <%SuichiTanaka> It's Murder Hobo flavor D&D
[4:09:07] <+WingBuffet> bwahven
[4:09:09] <+Grayhammatter> PogChamp

[4:09:47] <zamzoph> Quebec sucks
[4:09:48] <Futurecity10> OH CANADA
