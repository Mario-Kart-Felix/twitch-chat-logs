[0:27:06] <zal_silverfang> Mobile games trash
[0:27:09] <Dreigun> especially them
[0:27:09] <Mr_Strut> The mobile devs need that the most though

[0:27:20] <%PlayKingdomHeartsGames> Yeah that place is the dumpster
[0:27:20] <+VariantX7> its like bringing a dog to a cat show
[0:27:21] <Logan_Jennings1> sigh... can we just move on from this fucking Diablo news. I'm so tired of hearing about it now
[0:27:21] <$HentaiSenpai9K> @peachsaliva I recently discovered your musical talents. Would you consider playing a singing/karaoke game on stream?
[0:27:21] <thelonechris> That entire deal was a shitshow
[0:27:22] <%Kataguro> Mobile games have a worse track record, but aren't bad on their own. That game seems very bad though
[0:27:22] <+Skatedeandre> it was
[0:27:22] <BourneWarrior> mobile games BAD
[0:27:25] <+Diabetic> I'll play it, but I'll never spend money on it
[0:27:28] <%jiin6> Don't you have phones?
[0:27:28] <%happyface699> Yeah!!!!
[0:27:30] <CaptainKarite> yes
[0:27:32] <Wattermany> but sao mobile dlc tho
[0:27:34] <%AncelDeLambert> Poor Cheng
[0:27:34] <Hawkbone_> 99.99% of the mobile games industry is pure garbage that is beyond redemption
[0:27:35] <RCDv57> Is this an out of season april fools joke?
[0:27:35] <+sundizzle> what, you guys don't have phones?
[0:27:36] <%rdark_ksu> and here is our big finisher! a mobile who gives a shit fuck ya'll fart fart fart
[0:27:39] <+LogothX> mobile reskin cashgrab. Blizzard lost their souls

[0:27:40] <%Typhaeon> Just have a phone 4Head
[0:27:41] <+Skatedeandre> If it was attached to something it would have been fine
[0:27:42] <+Nymphonomicon> @PeachSaliva They had insults for the crowd.
[0:27:45] <T_Sasquatch> I literally have no space on my phone for any games
[0:27:47] <+griffball13> don't you have a phone you plebs
[0:27:48] <%Solidnick18> oof
[0:27:49] <%happyface699> james hetfield cant cream anymore
[0:27:54] <+Lovelyartbirb> The way you reveal a mobile game is the way Gears Pop was revealed
[0:27:54] <denam_of_windscale> ACTUALLY, I DON'T. WHO'DA THUNK IT
[0:27:55] <%Kataguro> Diablo is just functions. No one remembers the Witch Doctor anyway
[0:27:55] <+Dark_Shogun6715> U no hav fone?
[0:27:55] <$Tredecian> apparently that guy was a developer
[0:27:56] <Kalcom> But you insult us all the time
[0:27:56] <linkthellama> Mobile games are okay, mobile Chinese gatcha games aren't
[0:27:57] <cerberuscarmine> I DONT OWN A PHONE
[0:27:58] <TheZillex> I tried playing a mobile game recently and my phone got hot and ran out all my battery
[0:27:58] <ECRead> someone dress up as a cell phone and then just high-pitch screech
[0:27:59] <+badchoice5> I mean, you guys insult your audience and it seems to work
[0:28:00] <AMajorTom> Q&A: When can we expect an artbook for this new mobile game
[0:28:01] <$konekoryugamine> That doesn't sound like an insult as much as that sounds like a late 1990's question from a presenter.
[0:28:01] <+Diabetic> they could've just talked about d3 on the switch for ffs
[0:28:01] <cerberuscarmine> YOU FUCKSSSSS
[0:28:02] <$SvenHolgersson> EDGY AS FUCK
[0:28:04] <CrabSlacks> I don't have a phone
[0:28:05] <Jman409> Uppity
[0:28:06] <$HentaiSenpai9K> I just want Starcraft 3
[0:28:06] <Estuko> Phones are for stealth porn at work, not VIDEO GAMES
[0:28:06] <+PenmanLupine> All they needed was a still image of Diablo with the number 4 and all they had to say "Coming soon"
[0:28:07] <vectorcannonready> Remember Command and Conquer mobile?
[0:28:07] <%AncelDeLambert> I'd put movies on my phone before I put games on it, because it's better suited to that
[0:28:08] <awsomesaucekirby> cheer232 I just got some of my indiegogo TTS pillar custodian stretch goals 3d files. Soon I shall have the main course! Big oily man statues! Also, pat will never cross dress as well as Rata.
[0:28:10] <nepwar> hey i have a dreamcast, dont mean i want games to come out for it
[0:28:10] <mercado94> but i need to waste money in something that isnt waifu bait!
[0:28:11] <+KDZen_> Its like when Gears POP! Was announced. If it had not been for the Gears 4 announcement seconds later, people would have been pissed. but because people got the thing they wanted nobody gave a fuck
[0:28:11] <+DeathByAttempt> SEGA comes out to the E3 stage with a slow lead in of VF music, cut to Akria doin Tesuzankos and then straight to a mobile gatcha game. Moral of the story, no mobile on main stage
[0:28:12] <+Ssaik> the INDUSTRY for mobile is fucked, not the games
[0:28:12] <%TheCrispyBoi> is this an April fool's day joke?
[0:28:14] <frogurtz> Never insult the audience, always a bad idea.
[0:28:14] <Bouldus> my phone makes phonecalls
[0:28:16] <%jiin6> It was a dumb reply
[0:28:19] <+Taglog7> SwiftRage dont you guys have phones?

[0:28:39] <%GoCoSpace> "I don't like anal" - Customer "You have an anus, don't you?" - Blizzard

[0:30:20] <kabishen> Pat, how many stones are in the wall behind you?
[0:30:21] <$konekoryugamine> @PeachSaliva Yeah my sister downloaded the game and said she couldn't play it due to the servers on the Xbone X being compromised. I knew she was bluffing but still.
[0:30:22] <+Diabetic> @PeachSaliva and Pat advertised for F76. "Thanks Fallout 76" lol
[0:30:22] <%AncelDeLambert> BUY HIM ALL THE TOYS

[0:35:29] <cerberuscarmine> XD
[0:35:30] <ValidVenasaur> Its a 7 at best
[0:35:31] <+Xeno351> it's because goblin slayer looks like a buff skeleton doesn't it?
[0:35:31] <+TheDeadpoolDash> it isn't even that edgy, it is essentially a D&D campaign
[0:35:32] <+badchoice5> Who writes a name on your character sheet/
[0:35:33] <King_Wulgard> Goblin slayer is super dope

[0:35:38] <@Calek> sounds like how I do my writing

[0:35:42] <RantingRavager> ANVIL BEST GIRL
[0:35:42] <mrjohncarlton> Its just a guy killing goblins. Just like Doom is just a guy killing demons that's all it needs to be

[0:36:18] <+hahaha1171> i don't like thy CGI on his armor
[0:36:18] <+DrGlendale> Was it Mili? They do neat stuff if it's the same artist I'm thinking about.
[0:36:19] <%Coystick> Manga is reaaaally good
[0:36:19] <+aversal_ammar> It still bad tho

[0:36:25] <mercado94> @PeachSaliva Have you check out the spinoffs
[0:36:26] <knomad2b> exactly
[0:36:27] <%DarkKnightOfOolacile> Goblin Slayer gets a bad rep
[0:36:28] <+emperri> is it as metal as the ED from Asobi Asobase, a slice of life anime about middle school girls?
[0:36:28] <KoyaMusa> after the first scene its fairly tame
[0:36:29] <+badchoice5> Apparently it never goes that hard again, or so I hear
[0:36:29] <PinkCatHime> That's exactly what it is
[0:36:30] <Kaitepaints> barrSqueent
[0:36:30] <$Sphincter_Spelunker> Berserk tho
[0:36:31] <+rabidclone> its a way of filtering the weaklings. like woolie
[0:36:33] <s00bway> get elmo some cat wine
[0:36:33] <%Noahccountingfortaste> @peachsaliva the spinoff mangas are good too
[0:36:34] <%Arnschen> Literally has a line that says "Roll your d20"
[0:36:34] <%AncelDeLambert> that's why he did it, yep
[0:36:34] <%happyface699> Paige is talking normal
[0:36:34] <$HentaiSenpai9K> For I am GOBLIN SLAYER
[0:36:34] <CaptainKarite> Like in Berserk :D
[0:36:35] <%Coystick> No it's not, it's nothing people are having a tism
[0:36:35] <lethallylactic> Paige gets it
[0:36:36] <$Fenrirlives> @PeachSaliva So do I draw you as Lizard Shaman and Pat as Dwarf Priest?
[0:36:36] <+Ssaik> Agree actually
[0:36:36] <Vroom0> She gets it BibleThump
[0:36:39] <+bloomingzonda> @PeachSaliva The LNs are good and free on the GS subreddit
[0:36:39] <reiju_22> :) /
[0:36:39] <+Bupkis7> FUCK THE MANGA
[0:36:39] <Huntercd> Goblin Slayer is good
[0:36:40] <knomad2b> u need to see how awful goblins are
[0:36:40] <%Arnschen> In the OP
[0:36:41] <$KaiserRolled> IT doesn't glorify it or anything it's supposed to make you hate them
[0:36:42] <%graffitisamurai> @peachsaliva gets it
[0:36:42] <+Hilleltaco> Maybe could have been executed better, but it does have a purpose
[0:36:42] <chocobodundee> so its attack on titan 2
[0:36:42] <emoonimoo> Thank you!
[0:36:43] <%AncelDeLambert> She big gets it
[0:36:43] <RantingRavager> She gets it BibleThump
[0:36:45] <%Remery_> She gets it
[0:36:46] <Dragonfang1337> disagree but fair enough paige
[0:36:47] <+zalonar> anyone check ut mothers basement's vid yet?

[0:36:50] <+MMetas> I'm so happy!
[0:36:51] <Dave__> Nuh its just edgy
[0:36:51] <+aversal_ammar> It’s kinda lazy though
[0:36:51] <denam_of_windscale> it's not berserk tho
[0:36:52] <Estuko> I don't agree w/ the style but I'm not gonna knock others for it
[0:36:53] <+drakthebest> Paige is spitting some truth and I like it
[0:36:53] <%PlayKingdomHeartsGames> Its to make the goblins unlikable in the same way Araki always kills dogs
[0:36:55] <+KDZen_> If you guys like the opening, listen to Millennium Mother from Mili. incredible album
[0:36:57] <Bouldus> it makes "weak" enemies seems liek a hreat to the everyday person
[0:36:58] <Worldbrand> ya nailed it
[0:36:58] <tearsaurther> @peachsaliva chech the manga Blade of the Immortal, its lije a samurai buddy cop mentor story
[0:36:58] <Luesagna00> @peachsaliva EDDDDDDge kooooord!
[0:36:59] <CastellanVon> Even something as amazing as Berserk isn't for everyone
[0:36:59] <%Lion_kun> The only good goblins are the ones that don't leave their stinking holes.
[0:37:00] <%rdark_ksu> exactly! like shit is dark. you gotta inspire a life of hatred for GS
[0:37:00] <+Lovelyartbirb> attack on titan season 2 is trash
[0:37:00] <Derkinstacker> that first scene is also pretty much it.
[0:37:00] <%bread_assassin> It's one of the few things they can do to immediately justify the extinction of goblins.
[0:37:00] <mr_slaide> It's okay, the only ones offended are sjw's and they're idiots anyway.
[0:37:01] <+cvp5127> she gets itt

[0:37:08] <Fujiwara_92> @PeachSaliva how far are you in GS manga?
[0:37:10] <Kaitepaints> Ugh, nooooooooo! I can’t get through that kind of shit
[0:37:10] <xddddsorandom> It's big dumb show with no substance

[0:37:27] <SGrim> @PeachSaliva then please explain the sexualization of the scene. The Light Novel handles it better, but the manga and anime have blantant focus on tits and ass during the rape. It's not something to get through. It's something to abhor.

[0:38:12] <%CyborgAV> That was not sexy in the slightest
[0:38:12] <$ImasukyLomae> it was unpleasant
[0:38:12] <%rdark_ksu> horrific. the word is horrific
[0:38:12] <%graffitisamurai> what? it was horrifying
[0:38:13] <%Zaver88> *oof
[0:38:14] <$KaiserRolled> In what fucking universe was it sexualized in the anime?!
[0:38:15] <Rhinoprotoss> Watched too many of the hentais
[0:38:16] <awsomesaucekirby> Geoff would disagree with that
[0:38:18] <mr_slaide> It's insulting and abhorrent if you're an easily offended sjw.
[0:38:18] <T_Sasquatch> it was sexy tho
[0:38:19] <Kaitepaints> @knowthemuffinman WTF why are you NOT in Greenland?
[0:38:20] <sosuke5> "It wasn't a good rape" - Digibro
[0:38:20] <%Djinnazz> ppl will still jerk to it.
[0:38:20] <$SvenHolgersson> It was rape so yea no sexy
[0:38:21] <DXLelouch24> maybe if it was Goblin girls instead
[0:38:21] <+cereal_box_conspiracy> Listen, we all got our kinks.
[0:38:21] <Bouldus> it wasnt as well doen as Cascas scenes were but it was fine
[0:38:23] <TheZillex> But whats more sexy than a goblin
[0:38:23] <pakuman> some of those goblins were kinda cut ngl
[0:38:23] <mercado94> Geoff will disagree
[0:38:23] <santafer> The manga and LN are better, the show is skipping a lot of arcs
[0:38:24] <Zantetzuken> pat's not here to carry NotLikeThis

[0:38:30] <%ssjklyco> Goblin Rape is literally Grape. Think about it
[0:38:32] <SGrim> sexualization =/= sexy. Not even mentioned in my post.
[0:38:34] <Kalcom> detrone the anime pope
[0:38:34] <hntronium> Geoff has a shit opinion
[0:38:35] <DedlokPM> It was not sexy, but the blocking and placement of the goblins was definitely sexualized
[0:38:36] <$Fenrirlives> what's sexual about a girl getting claws dug into her skin as she screams in agony?
[0:38:36] <T_Sasquatch> her back was arched
[0:38:36] <+Hilleltaco> I don't think that's what they meant, they weren't saying they found it sexy, they were saying it was framed that way
[0:38:37] <%Solidnick18> lol

[0:38:48] <Hawkbone_> MonkaS
[0:38:48] <+Comrade_Vladof> It's supposed to make you want to murder goblins as much as the MC

[0:38:55] <awsomesaucekirby> What if Elmo is gay though?
[0:38:55] <knomad2b> geofs a cuck soooo
[0:38:55] <nepwar> i think hes refering to the mothers basement critque about how it focus more on showing T&A than the actual horror of the scene. eg goblins ripping the girls clothes but making sure not to block and of the lewd bits @PeachSaliva
[0:38:57] <DeepPix3l> Goblin Slayer critics: "Why they making rape so sexy?" Everyone else: DansGame
[0:38:58] <santafer> Rape will always be about sex, so it will always be sexualized.
[0:39:00] <Mortal_Wombat_I> Yeah all I heard about goblin slayer was that it was pretty good IF you can stomach the grossness of that prologue sequence. I personally thought it looked way too exploitative but that’s just my onion

Pat has the perfect mentality of a Sergeant - is an asshole and will call out your bullshit.
[0:39:04] <suikudo> I think Jeff couldnt be more wrong

[0:39:09] <hntronium> RIP Big Puss
[0:39:10] <arcaderabbit48> I think part of the problem is that there are Those People who will find anything sexy. So Those People start talking about it and start spreading the wrong idea about it. Keep in mind those same people ask for More Rape in stuff like this and Berserk
[0:39:13] <%Sinister_Aglet> I loling at where this stream goes when Pat leaves

[0:39:28] <DraxTD> @theo_marks Pat's a ghosty
[0:39:29] <energywarning> pat should've said no
[0:39:31] <emoonimoo> The Goblins know!
[0:39:31] <mercado94> The REAL goblins has come full with Redbull cans
[0:39:32] <suikudo> I think the show is framed to be like in any other anime you would have your pee pee out but not here
[0:39:32] <%happyface699> Murder
[0:39:33] <+Ssaik> it made my penis become the smaller penis
[0:39:34] <Bouldus> Rape scenes are usually depicted as power play type scenes
[0:39:34] <+Comrade_Vladof> The rape was framed as rape, go figure
[0:39:35] <Hawkbone_> !raffle
[0:39:35] <+MMetas> We should all go out and kill our local goblins
[0:39:36] <jijipose> Its supposed to make you hate the goblins

[0:39:37] <Mastigias> HELL YEAH COW GIRL
[0:39:37] <b1gboss007> Just 1 horror
[0:39:37] <T_Sasquatch> she was face down , ass up
[0:39:37] <jacklekins> the problem with goblin slayers first episode is that those characters dont matter and it was a bunch of no bodies so it doesnt have the same affect as someone you already care about.
[0:39:38] <heatrashes> imagine if it wasnt pat......... spooky
[0:39:39] <+MarshallLee67> COW TITS
[0:39:40] <$monkeyhous3> Pat might be a goblin fyi

[0:39:42] <Campost> !raffle
[0:39:42] <DedlokPM> @PeachSaliva What they mean by "Framed that way" they mean the placement of the the goblins making sure you can see the boobs and butt when they should be dogpiling her

[0:39:49] <+drakthebest> Look at paige being so reasonable
[0:39:49] <+grandmonkbun> It is a Doppleganger
[0:39:52] <mercado94> check those cows
[0:39:53] <Bouldus> rather then sexualized
[0:39:54] <Derkinstacker> udders
[0:39:54] <+cvp5127> no thots, only goblins
[0:39:57] <%rdark_ksu> big ol googlie mooglies
[0:39:57] <xddddsorandom> The problem with Goblin Slayer for me has nothing to do with the dumb controversy it's the fact that it has no real characters or objectives and the enemies are BIG BAD AND EVIL so it makes the conflict boring
[0:39:57] <knomad2b> MILK
[0:39:58] <Jman409> Cow girl is great
[0:40:00] <JohnJackJohnson> People really are stretching to call the scene sexualised

[0:40:04] <zal_silverfang> Paige you ARE a furry for other reasons
[0:40:06] <@commanderclaw> Paige is a stealth furry
[0:40:06] <%RaikenTB> she got nice tiddys

[0:40:11] <%AncelDeLambert> WEEEEEEEEEB!
[0:40:11] <+Freakin_Osvaldo> Mega milk
[0:40:13] <%theo_marks> BIG COW TIDDY
[0:40:14] <KoyaMusa> there are many good girls in goblin slayer but goblin slayer wants to kill the goblins
[0:40:16] <fearturkey24> you should watch mother's basement about that to get an idea of what people are saying
[0:40:16] <%redstonej> big tits for big goblins
[0:40:17] <Rhinoprotoss> Don't talk about Mother's Shillbag
[0:40:17] <$ImasukyLomae> Paige is not a furry, she wants to fuck stuff with no skin
[0:40:18] <+aversal_ammar> So Goblin Slayer is for horny people?
[0:40:18] <mr_slaide> Tons of milk.

[0:40:20] <+HostilePoundcakes> Cow girl = girl with big boobs
[0:40:23] <%Gogogolem> @PeachSaliva The thing about goblin slayer is i don't feel it would be getting as much as attention if it didn't have that scene in it.
[0:40:24] <DXLelouch24> Paige watch SSSS Gridman
[0:40:25] <%Remery_> MILK HER

[0:40:28] <DedlokPM> @PeachSaliva What they mean by "Framed that way" they mean the placement of the the goblins making sure you can see the boobs and butt when they should be dogpiling her
[0:40:28] <bambowl> its all about tone
[0:40:33] <viewtifulr> shows sucks next question
[0:40:35] <pectusumbra> It's the same thing as Explanation Point talked about with the likes of Eromanga Sensei
[0:40:35] <Dethhollow> It's really sad that we need a scene of pure fanservice just so people know "This isn't meant to turn you on"
[0:40:36] <Wattermany> might just skip ep 1
[0:40:36] <+Lovelyartbirb> Did anyone see the episode of pokemon with miltank in the desert?
[0:40:36] <bsmusic> Context matters
[0:40:37] <Prevot> I'd rather watch the good goblin show with the slime than the bad one with the rape
[0:40:37] <Parapattern> Paige has found the Anti-Fur Equation
[0:40:38] <santafer> There is not a large story because he is not the "MC" of the world
[0:40:39] <Bouldus> yea it was sort of mroe like, ok this is a thing in this
[0:40:40] <DatAsuna> Mother's basement basically makes the point it's justified in the light novel but misunderstood and sexualized in the manga and show
[0:40:40] <Mastigias> "because gobolinz"
[0:40:40] <%GarbageNirvana> It ain't that deep
[0:40:40] <ECRead> at the end of the day, it's a drawing
[0:40:41] <+Rinkimah> Goblin Slayer does it ONCE to se tthe mood. Plus Berzerk was WAYYY worse and nobody rioted over that
[0:40:41] <%Djinnazz> It's called Hentai. And it's ART.
[0:40:42] <Mr_Strut> People love to be outraged.

[0:40:44] <+McSoliace> let people like things
[0:40:45] <KoyaMusa> no not all of us
[0:40:45] <+AntithesisEK> still feels like an editor's decision more than the illustrators to 'oversell' the situation.
[0:40:46] <$KaiserRolled> We're gonna make it after all
[0:40:47] <+HypestMoose> People like to be outraged
[0:40:48] <%UncannyMatt> It's just bootleg Berserk
[0:40:49] <Volture_> Anime is stinky
[0:40:49] <bsmusic> People often forget that

[0:40:51] <%Remery_> Nice hand job action
[0:40:51] <Divryne> We're in this together you guys.
[0:40:51] <%Noahccountingfortaste> it's just showing goblins are super evil, yet bafflingly ignored by the greedy "good guys"
[0:40:51] <+peregrin_iii> No cryGrump

[0:40:52] <BritishBulldork> The easiest thing it to not care when people demand that shit of you.
[0:40:53] <Inebriateddonut> ANIME IS SRS BUSNES
[0:40:54] <Kaitepaints> EXPLAIN DIS
[0:40:54] <PinkCatHime> goblin slayer, the first anime that has rape in it, apparently
[0:40:57] <skrewarrior> I hate playing good games
[0:40:57] <mercado94> Experts in cinematography and storytelling like MotherBasement will disagree
[0:40:57] <%graffitisamurai> she likes the show, get over it
[0:40:58] <+bloomingzonda> Well how do you explain elf archers cute ears
[0:40:59] <%Ez3z> Mother's basement's video on the subject is actually a pretty fair analysis but that won't stop people from acting like he's demanding the show is banned from airing
[0:41:00] <TheZillex> anime is my lifeblood
[0:41:00] <Fujiwara_92> once again i'm with paige on this one
[0:41:02] <arcaderabbit48> Could they not have done the same but without rape? Was the rape needed when horrible slaughter would suffice?
[0:41:02] <suikudo> Jeff should stick to talking about OP;s
[0:41:02] <nepwar> i agree with mothers basement on the framing, but i don't think its a bad show or the episode is a war crime
[0:41:02] <Chumblago13> @PeachSaliva I found it interesting that goblins do that sort of thing regularly but are still treated as "minor threats" by adventurers who feel above them.
[0:41:03] <DXLelouch24> its not
[0:41:05] <%AncelDeLambert> We're all gonna watch Orcbolg rip a fucking troll in half with a water laser
[0:41:05] <+drakthebest> @PeachSaliva Cow girl's sexualization is supposed to make you go like "wow goblinslayer is super fucked for not being into this super hot girl who's trying to jump his bones"
[0:41:08] <T_Sasquatch> ive literally seen way worse in anime LUL
[0:41:10] <DXLelouch24> did everyone forget RAPEHORSE?
[0:41:13] <Pairoschuz> @Ez3z truth

[0:41:36] <SGrim> @PeachSaliva if we're continuing the discussion: my point is the scene itself makes sure to keep her tits and ass in view. It's even more explicit in the manga. The light novel (i.e. the creators original draft) describes the violence, but the manga and anime make sure to include fan-service. It's disgusting.

[0:42:33] <Kalcom> why is he a big racist?
[0:42:33] <comfyman12> @PeachSaliva I liked the concept that every adventurer is focused on glory and fighting the huge dragons meanwhile nobody is helping the farmers and folks getting ravaged by goblins
[0:42:33] <Wyrmsblood> Fuck them, Pat don't care

[0:42:36] <Karhax> "dissapointed"
[0:42:36] <%Doctor_Death_Bed> the thing of people saying "they coulda done it with just slaughter instead of rape" and like...you guys are still talking about it...so its sticking way more
[0:42:37] <%AncelDeLambert> Give Pat shit for retweeting someone, prepare to be ignored/laughed at

[0:42:53] <+Grayhammatter> that's fucked
[0:42:54] <%redstonej> did Pat retweet racism again?
[0:42:54] <%SuperCasualBoom> cheer200 Good evening, black mustard seed & red cabbage coleslaw! How much profit did you make off selling Elmo’s shedding hair on eBay so far? Stupid bullshit my street I live on became a one way street for no reason. Also, how in a few days did this become “Paige and Pat vs The World” with the stupid subs only issue and recent Twitter Shitters. It like when a content creator I followed just asked only for $4 to watch his entire new season and fans gave him shit. People take things 4 granted 🤬

[0:55:40] <+Mixawaves> 90 DAYS FIANCE
[0:55:41] <%swordsman70> I mean, the first episode is about proving that they're not racist
[0:55:41] <Karhax> watamote
[0:55:41] <+RedMaskBandit> sunny
[0:55:42] <+HiroTSK5> Sunny is nowhere near as cringey as other cringe shows
[0:55:42] <%Daigrey> curb
[0:55:42] <Volture_> Bird up
[0:55:42] <%ssjklyco> Sunny is the epitome of "We're not bad people, we're just SHITTY people"
[0:55:43] <%PlayKingdomHeartsGames> Nevermind Watamote
[0:55:43] <+hdhyperdrive> Office is way more cringe

[0:55:46] <%rdark_ksu> watamote was waaaaay easier
[0:55:47] <%SWFanatic> Curb is tougher to watch
[0:55:48] <bipdipper> Nathan for you if youre a real one
[0:55:48] <%RNGsusDied4Wins> Curb is real Sunny is Dark

[0:55:50] <+dramajoe> yeah curb, but sunny is close
[0:55:51] <+kojibeoulve> first episode of sunny is about getting racist
[0:55:51] <%AgentTexes> cheer250 Charlie and Mac beating up a bunch of kids over a bike is also a great scene.
[0:55:52] <Dr_Donkey_Brains> Sunny isn't cringey it's just funny
[0:55:52] <+R0bobot> Sunny is absurd
[0:55:53] <Hawkbone_> @PeachSaliva The real answer is Louie
[0:55:54] <fakemalegamer> WATAMOTE
[0:55:54] <seniorwhiteface> Curb X Sunny Crossover would be great
[0:55:55] <Logan_Jennings1> Sunny is watchable, Curb hurts.

[0:55:59] <Jman409> Sunny is an easier watch
[0:56:00] <+Sora20030c> I had to shut off Watamote, I can watch both the others but watamote is a whole 'nother level
[0:56:01] <%ArtemisM822> Sunny is hilarious. Curb hurts
[0:56:02] <orihsnek> Curb 100%
[0:56:05] <%DrWolpertinger> @swfanatic HEY YOU, HOW CAN I GET INTO THE DISCORD
[0:56:05] <%generalve> NATHAN
[0:56:06] <%rdark_ksu> black friends

[0:56:25] <+DeadpanSoupcan> god that firsdt episode
[0:56:26] <Kaitepaints> @starlightgalactic second
[0:56:26] <+Taglog7> THE IMPLICATIONS
[0:56:26] <+Grayhammatter> WOW
[0:56:28] <$Piemono> Dee is not dating a Black guy, that dude was super gay
[0:56:28] <+twohitgood> curb is pretty hard sometimes. sunny is more very stupid people scheming.
[0:56:28] <+Nefarious_Bear> Oh noooo
[0:56:30] <+kojibeoulve> and 6
[0:56:30] <weissguard> WutFace

[0:56:31] <%TeamSe7yn> It's Always Sunny is the best
[0:56:31] <Bouldus> that sounds liek a good afternoon Kappa
[0:56:33] <+TheDeadpoolDash> oof
[0:56:34] <Derkinstacker> it's amazing
[0:56:34] <%SWFanatic> Link your twitch acct in discord
[0:56:35] <SkyPirateArcane> That's fucking amazing
[0:56:35] <+Lovelyartbirb> Which should I watch first?
[0:56:35] <weissguard> THAT'S THE WORST
[0:56:36] <Hawkbone_> Louie is the real cringe
[0:56:36] <%forevern2dust> So good
[0:56:37] <%swordsman70> It's the best
[0:56:39] <LiquidMathew> Charlie says the N word too
[0:56:40] <leviathan666303> the DENNIS system
[0:56:42] <+Antoids> the always sunny characters start as bad as the seinfeld characters end
[0:56:42] <+trnzero> not just sex
[0:56:42] <%happyface699> It’s so fucked
[0:56:42] <bambowl> its so good
[0:56:44] <%rdark_ksu> i didnt even make it 10 min into sunny
[0:56:44] <Laironx3> Bunny hop again?
[0:56:46] <TheMilhouseExperience> That's several seasons in.
[0:56:46] <Jman409> The best
[0:56:47] <vectorcannonready> You put Curb on MVCI, Pat.
[0:56:47] <Prevot> my favorite Curb joke is Larry calling a black guy "My Caucasian"
[0:56:47] <+dramajoe> youre getting dennis'd
[0:56:48] <$Sphincter_Spelunker> Watamote made me yell "Nooooo" out loud. Sunny is fine
[0:56:49] <cerberuscarmine> what i miss?
[0:56:51] <+Dovakhin573> pat you anymore hxh?
[0:56:51] <OkamiDude15> oh man the dennis system woopsKek
[0:56:51] <%forevern2dust> paige has a discord?
[0:56:54] <+Ryuartyi_> A sub, unlike a Twitch dom
[0:56:55] <%forevern2dust> !discord
[0:56:56] <ape_hawk> yeah, dennis is a goddamn sociopath
[0:56:57] <Kaitepaints> So is dickmasterson real?
[0:56:58] <+cereal_box_conspiracy> No one in Sunny is ever actually that uncomfortable. Everyone is either a monster or reacting with anger.
[0:57:00] <$Agami23> what about the episode about the chick who gets artificially inseminated for money and becomes friends with the parents and steals their pool?
[0:57:01] <%SuichiTanaka> Paige loves subs
[0:57:02] <$Tredecian> pain
[0:57:04] <+Voidwyvern> Always Sunny is my favorite show about stupid people doing awful things.
[0:57:06] <+Ssaik> it hurts so much
[0:57:07] <+badchoice5> A knife in the stomach
[0:57:08] <%mistymntns> @PeachSaliva You can also join through connections on discord under Twitch.
[0:57:08] <BigNerdSam> Boat sex implications
[0:57:11] <+Skatedeandre> I never knew watamote was cringe
[0:57:11] <%AncelDeLambert> @Kaitepaints he is... in your heart
[0:57:11] <%NWR_James> I could read watamote but once it was animated it was not watchable
[0:57:14] <zechariazen> I'm overly empathic as well it's totally a thing
[0:57:17] <@SSaryn> it gets a little too real at times...
[0:57:18] <321Continue> It's Elmo's fault im not popular!
[0:57:19] <+Grayhammatter> partially real
[0:57:19] <romanticzomedy> holy shit that's a fancy couch

[0:57:29] <b1gboss007> Watamote iss too real
[0:57:29] <+R0bobot> The Cereal Defense is one of my favorite TV show episodes ever.
[0:57:29] <OkamiDude15> @Skatedeandre its not bad per say but its just TOO REAL
[0:57:29] <Jman409> That one really hurt
[0:57:30] <+Nefarious_Bear> FUCKING CHAD
[0:57:30] <MastinMusic> dickmasterson is real and surreal at the same time. He's the schrodinger's cat of dicks
[0:57:30] <+emperri> he's America's Favorite Mexican
[0:57:30] <BourneWarrior> I barely got through one episode of Watamote

[0:57:45] <Twoiis> Dungeon crawling and monster eating.
[0:57:46] <lloyddboy> GOOD SHIT
[0:57:46] <Prevot> THAT'S GOOD SHIT
[0:57:47] <%koriar> Dungeon Meshi is great you eat all the monsters
[0:57:49] <yendoria> ITs about eating monsters
[0:57:49] <Mittensbro> watamote is not a show you watch it is an exercise in social torture
[0:57:51] <$dalmek> It's a cooking manga, ostensibly
[0:57:51] <RantingRavager> IT'S ABOUT A DUNGEON NAMED MESHI
[0:57:52] <comfyman12> THEY GO INTO DUNGEONS AND COOK MONSTERS
[0:57:52] <$GohanEgret> elmo pls

[0:57:53] <+AntithesisEK> NOOOOOO DON'T RUIN IT
[0:57:54] <pectusumbra> people have to dungeon crawl and eat the monsters along the way to survive
[0:57:54] <%graffitisamurai> thats the good shit!!
[0:57:55] <+onlystrykerfan> Watamote gets less cringy
[0:57:56] <+AntithesisEK> NOOOOOOO
[0:57:56] <Kaitepaints> @anceldelambert I mean, does he believe what he says? I only just saw a clip of him on dr.phil
[0:57:56] <zanzibar_junker> Dungeon monster cooking
[0:57:56] <$Piemono> Dungeon Meshi is about adventures who have to survive off monsters meat cause they're poor
[0:57:57] <SGrim> Bell best boi, and Hestia eliminates all competiton
[0:58:01] <+PenmanLupine> Guys when you recommend something, please describe it a little. whats the point otherwise?
[0:58:01] <+il_barbiero> irony isn't real, pretending to be a misogynist just empowers others to be huge pricks
[0:58:02] <+joshiyoshi12> @PeachSaliva Dungeon meshi is at leas 10000x better then gobin slayer
[0:58:03] <Triplicat> paige's japanese pronunciation is better than all of the best friends' combinated
[0:58:03] <pectusumbra> combo dungeon fantasy with cooking manga
[0:58:04] <$Fenrirlives> @PeachSaliva Dungeon Meshi is delicious food + DnD shenanigans! SUPER GOOD!
[0:58:04] <%Solidnick18> idk what anime to watch recently
[0:58:05] <Bouldus> nice
[0:58:08] <+DomunDomunDomun> Dungeon meshi is great and completely wholesome.
[0:58:09] <cerberuscarmine> no mean to elmo its his birfdaaaaaaay
[0:58:12] <Perkell> Dungeon Meshi is amazing
[0:58:14] <+nolifegamin> So like Toriko but in a dungeon
[0:58:15] <madogod> elmo is one year closer to dying
[0:58:17] <+il_barbiero> where did him go
[0:58:17] <RollCritFail> So if Watamote is Anime Curb, is Konosuba Anime Always Sunny?
[0:58:18] <+Ssaik> Cold; the air and water flowing
[0:58:19] <%AncelDeLambert> @Kaitepaints someone tells me that he did Dr Phil and trolled the shit out of everyone
[0:58:21] <+Rinkimah> Zombie land is good
[0:58:23] <Stab_master_ars0n> Lethal Weapon 5 was a good movie.

[2:59:54] <Them00n> does this game have chainmail bikinis?
[2:59:55] <+SergeantSov> Somehow that has piercing resistance.
[2:59:58] <$joylent_blue> correct
[3:00:00] <OwlLightningMage> JUST FUCKING BUY ALL OF IT
[3:00:00] <+thebestestkevin> I also forgot how lame the armor looked for female characters
[3:00:01] <DXLelouch24> YOU DIDNT KNOW?
[3:00:01] <talisign> @katocrimson The left is the good one. Pat has confirmed
[3:00:03] <Graxe_> @PeachSaliva There's clothing, and then there's armor.
[3:00:03] <derap41> right of the vocations
[3:00:04] <+Ciphris> Clothing + armor
[3:00:05] <energywarning> brarmor
[3:00:06] <%The_Lady_Alustriel> This game already seems like a mess LUL
[3:00:06] <DXLelouch24> FRAUD DETECTED
[3:00:10] <fireking900> Paige makes the smallest things look like insurmountable tasks... its almost impressive.
[3:00:10] <%SuichiTanaka> It's the difference between CLOTHING and ARMOR
[3:00:14] <ArcanumMBD> Shirts are more for appearance than stats
[3:00:14] <+luftraumm1> this game is mostly just fashion until late game
[3:00:25] <+gralho> yea
[3:00:26] <+luftraumm1> use anything you want
[3:00:26] <+nolifegamin> just go full fashion
[3:00:27] <RickSaintRiot> wait, WHAT
[3:00:27] <derap41> left of vocacion shows if its cloting or armor
[3:00:30] <RickSaintRiot> there's a difference?!?!
[3:00:31] <Fujiwara_92> DID PAT ACTUALLY PLAY THIS?
[3:00:32] <+Elky3> she has a nice hat on chariWEEB
[3:00:33] <@PlagueOfGripes> wear a flannel pull over with a metal bra on top
[3:00:34] <Kiari13> did pat not know that or
[3:00:34] <RickSaintRiot> shit
[3:00:41] <RickSaintRiot> i been wearing clothes this whole damn time
[3:00:42] <Bouldus> it literally doesnt matter until past endgame
[3:00:45] <%moranprime> Holy cow you lose stamina fast in hard mode :(
[3:00:46] <+CaptainJax> JUST PICK WHATEVER LOOKS NICER
[3:00:49] <derap41> IT DOESN'T FUCKING MATTER
[3:00:51] <+Mekhet09> IT DOESN"T MATTER NOW
[3:00:53] <majindusto> Pat confirmed for Scrub
[3:00:56] <derap41> STOP MIN MAXING
[3:00:56] <Darlington_the_Deceiver> JUST WEAR NOTHING
[3:01:00] <$joylent_blue> GET WHAT LOOKS GOOD
[3:01:02] <RickSaintRiot> wear the Shrek Vest
[3:01:05] <ArcanumMBD> @PeachSaliva clothes always have crap stats, use them for appearance, and armor for actual stats
[3:01:05] <+CaptainJax> JUST GO
[3:01:05] <+Mekhet09> IT DOESN'T MATTER.
[3:01:06] <+SergeantSov> This matters not at all until endgame lol
[3:01:08] <+luftraumm1> fashion
[3:01:09] <OwlLightningMage> YOU HAVE INFINITE MONEY BUY IT ALL
[3:01:10] <b1gboss007> NotLikeThis NotLikeThis NotLikeThis
[3:01:17] <RickSaintRiot> clothes are cheating
[3:01:26] <%AncelDeLambert> clothes are for the weak
[3:01:26] <$joylent_blue> so is mine
[3:01:28] <darkslide44> Hemp wow big dank 420
[3:01:28] <Kaitepaints> @plagueofgripes and the top is either very very loose or skin tight. No in between!
[3:01:32] <@PlagueOfGripes> she will walk outside and find better gear
[3:01:39] <+Mekhet09> oh god
[3:01:40] <cordhine> You're doing great, Paige
[3:01:44] <tysmiller> fonz armor
[3:01:45] <%moranprime> Pat: Isn't it silly that the main character's house is right next to the Inn but we have to pay to stay the night at the inn? xD
[3:01:45] <cerberuscarmine> !uptime
[3:01:47] <RickSaintRiot> them, sobbing: you can't just keep pointing at everything and say it's cheating
[3:01:47] <Minorou> Big learning!

[3:02:06] <ArcanumMBD> Gotta protect the one boob
[3:02:07] <$BuoyantSoul> Protect your favorite boob
[3:02:08] <@PlagueOfGripes> that hydra won't know what to do against this much money
[3:02:09] <+SergeantSov> All of these stats matter so infinitely little
[3:02:12] <+Ciphris> having one out like an amazon
[3:02:13] <%Coystick> Tiddy armor
[3:02:13] <%forevern2dust> it protecc the broke boob
[3:02:14] <+nolifegamin> YE YE YE FASHION!
[3:02:14] <@SSaryn> Yeah, heighten the good titty.
[3:02:21] <%SuichiTanaka> That's the Marriage Titty~
[3:02:21] <RickSaintRiot> ff--f-f-f-fashion
[3:02:21] <majindusto> It's all about fashion
[3:02:25] <Roninx136> This game looks like a train wreck :D
[3:02:26] <energywarning> she's going to spend more time shopping than designing her own pawn
[3:02:26] <$joylent_blue> will we ever get to Pat pawn
[3:02:32] <Darlington_the_Deceiver> nothing is gonna save you from the goblin stank anyway Kappa
[3:02:32] <Kiari13> when was the last time she hit something?
[3:02:34] <+RafflesiaA> Just attack the enemies with your thousands of pounds of gold coins
[3:02:34] <DXLelouch24> yes
[3:02:36] <arcaderabbit48> This. This is why we can never let her anywhere near FF14
[3:02:37] <+Dovakhin573> I feel paiges character will become that buff chick from Overlord
[3:02:38] <Bouldus> the stats are pretty meaningless until endgame
[3:02:39] <RickSaintRiot> You think you know fashion? Fashion's a stranger.
[3:02:40] <b1gboss007> I can smell the smoke from over here
[3:02:42] <derap41> the stats don't matter this early
[3:02:44] <Luesagna00> @peachsaliva protect only the marriage titteh!
[3:02:48] <+khroness> how come so much gold
[3:02:50] <+WaiL_FiN> Tiddaypatch
[3:02:53] <knomad2b> omg
[3:02:53] <ArcanumMBD> @Kiari13 she hit a dragon like an hour or two ago.
[3:02:56] <RickSaintRiot> You think fashion's your friend?
[3:02:57] <$joylent_blue> Kiari13 honestly the tutorial
[3:02:57] <DXLelouch24> they sold a dlc item

[3:03:04] <RickSaintRiot> My friend, fashion is DANGER.
[3:03:05] <OwlLightningMage> PAIGE IT DOESN'T MATTER
[3:03:05] <@PlagueOfGripes> after two hours she has not stepped out the front door
[3:03:07] <%forevern2dust> that's wrong pat

[3:03:11] <Worldbrand> You will also be replacing your armor quite often
[3:03:14] <%Keyd00d> YOU ASKED FOR THIS
[3:03:14] <%SuichiTanaka> This is exactly what I wanted
[3:03:15] <ArcanumMBD> no fuck rook
[3:03:18] <$joylent_blue> only your main pawn
[3:03:18] <+Mekhet09> NO
[3:03:19] <+SergeantSov> We've been here for 40 years
[3:03:20] <ArcanumMBD> you will never see Rook ever again

[3:12:15] <Graxe_> Paige is gonna fight the cyclops at night.
[3:12:16] <%DrGlendale> Hey Paige, since I know you like manga now, I'm gonna suggest looking at Spirit Circle. New girl in town has a vendetta from a past life and the MC was the one that pissed her off in a past life. Plot is basically him reliving past lives in order to help and getting emotionally worn out along the way. Looks sorta basic at first glance but it gets pretty emotional pretty quick. One of my favorite manga ever and it's severely under rated. I really think you'd like it.
[3:12:17] <Graxe_> Oh no.
[3:12:18] <DesuDesuDokiDoki> b i g

[3:29:22] <Fujiwara_92> GUARDIAN IS THE WORST
[3:29:22] <+st_judge> NOT guardian
[3:29:22] <$joylent_blue> NOT GUARDIAN
[3:29:22] <vectorcannonready> He's an actual pawn.
[3:29:22] <@PlagueOfGripes> "is this pawn a compromise of paige's integrity?" yes
[3:29:23] <%SuichiTanaka> Utilitarian
[3:29:23] <TheButtravage> @PeachSaliva What class do you want to be in the end Pat?
[3:29:24] <%topendbuzz> dont tell them
[3:29:25] <+trnzero> NOT GUARDIAN
[3:29:25] <faegbeard> REMEMBER NOT TO GET ACQUISITOR
[3:29:27] <derap41> Guardian sucks
[3:29:29] <Kiari13> put it all into scather
[3:29:29] <%SuichiTanaka> Mitigator
[3:29:30] <Laecerelius> Scather and Challenger I think?
[3:29:31] <Derkinstacker> SCATHER CHALLANGER
[3:29:32] <+CaptainJax> scather and mitigator
[3:29:35] <orkky> scather is good
[3:29:37] <faegbeard> SCATHER, MITIGATOR, CHALLENGER
[3:29:38] <@SSaryn> Mitigator Ultalitarian and Scather
[3:29:39] <%SuichiTanaka> Challenger you don't want
[3:29:40] <Minorou> depends on which class you want
[3:29:40] <derap41> protect and collect shit
[3:29:40] <+Comrade_Vladof> AVOID NEXUS AT ALL COST
[3:29:41] <DXLelouch24> Pat is a Sword and Board
[3:29:42] <Graxe_> Scather/Challenger/Utilitarian/Mitigator. Acquisitor can be annoying.
[3:29:44] <%SuichiTanaka> unless you want a tank
[3:29:47] <+RushUnplugged> SCATHER/MITIGATOR/UTILITARIAN
[3:29:49] <Craven_Morstead> Violator Inclination
[3:29:52] <Minorou> scather's bad for ranged pawns, for example
[3:29:54] <+st_judge> And Utilitarian for Sorcerors
[3:30:03] <tank7013> @PeachSaliva Actions you take can still fuck with these later. Don't pick up items during a fight!
[3:30:03] <+Jimboq> cowardice not an option?
[3:30:07] <%edited156> When the fuck did Pat get a six pack that took up most of his torso
[3:30:11] <$joylent_blue> what class is he gonna be
[3:30:14] <+CaptainJax> utilitarian's fine too, makes them more likely to use those items you never use
[3:30:14] <NiftyNox> wheres Cheater
[3:30:14] <katocrimson> build a shonen character
[3:30:15] <Kiari13> commands also affect them
[3:30:16] <$lotharrio> Amazon Paige and Sorcerer-Coward Pat.

[3:31:26] <Kiari13> pat take big strides
[3:31:26] <derap41> Strider
[3:31:27] <TsunTsuchinoko> nah, doubling classes is cool
[3:31:27] <ArcanumMBD> Mage is super useful cause you can tailor-make your own healer instead of needing to hunt for one every couple of levels
[3:31:27] <Laecerelius> Ther's plenty of good mages on the marketplace
[3:31:28] <Bouldus> Pat is a dirty sneaky mage
[3:31:28] <DXLelouch24> PAT LOVES TO BACKSTAB

[3:31:33] <%Remery_> Strider is archer/knife boy
[3:31:35] <%SuichiTanaka> Pat always wants to be a sneaky crossbow jerk
[3:31:37] <derap41> Better to have a secondary mage

[3:40:04] <ArcanumMBD> @PeachSaliva The more levels your Pawns have than you, the less XP you earn. Likewise, the lower your pawns are than you, the more XP you earn. It's 1% per level, caps out at 25%, and it stacks per pawn.

[3:54:37] <%iwishthiswasicq> @CapnCarnivore Good stuff, played it back on the 360. I've got a lot of free time lately, so I'm probably gonna try and play it again.
[3:54:39] <+Max_Kaiser> I just finished DMC 3 and 4 today
[3:54:40] <%The_Lady_Alustriel> I really wanted to pick this game up, but the PC re-release means it's pretty pricey again so it's been collecting dust on my wishlist
[3:54:42] <HannibalBeerus> RORBS AND BLORBS AND PORBS
[3:54:52] <Willfordbrimly> SKYRIM LASH IS FOR THE NORRRRRDS
[3:54:52] <+krispen_wa> Some PC mods fix the stat bullshit thankfully
[3:54:58] <%Estuko> @PlagueOfGripes I never bothered with it, felt like doing homework/chores and I just wanted to kick things

[3:55:42] <Fujiwara_92> YES, ARISEN?
[3:55:43] <EASrake> WHAT WILL IT BE TODAY
[3:55:45] <+DFDEDSDCD> hey @PlagueOfGripes Min/Maxing only works up til lvl 100 or something after that it is near useless to min/max as the stat points earned go from 5-10 to 0-2.
[3:55:47] <b1gboss007> OPEN YOUR EYES
[3:55:52] <@SSaryn> Biting Wind is great.
[3:55:54] <+CapnCarnivore> oh my god that looks just like him

[3:55:58] <+xxviios> I put the stinger on trianhle cause its a point

[4:03:42] <OwlLightningMage> It plays literally nothing like Dragon Age
[4:03:43] <+Tylermcd93> It was not turn based at all
[4:03:44] <+Ninestempest> it's slow as fuck

[4:04:37] <b1gboss007> put the lantern in a shortcut
[4:04:40] <%Estuko> @The_Lady_Alustriel in Dragon's Dogma you can climb around on the monster and attack spots like the eye, head, armour pieces (cyclops) etc, and they'll react accordingly like trying to knock you off
[4:04:41] <+Tylermcd93> @Willfordbrimly It is
[4:04:42] <+CaptainJax> @PeachSaliva pat bind her lantern to a key and just control the lantern for her

[4:23:17] <$serpenttucker> THIS ISLAND IS GREAT FOR GRINDING RIFT CRYSTALS
[4:23:19] <$mister___doctor> This game feels like a mixture of Dark Souls, Skyrim, Devil May Cry, and Monster Hunter
[4:23:20] <nekodelic> Bitterblack Isle is literally my favorite level design in any game
[4:23:21] <Graxe_> Time to leave and come back much later.

[4:23:32] <Sadolerlaqzarret> Is it just me or the black robed woman’s hair look gross
[4:23:40] <+krispen_wa> i remember that if you had the original game and installed this, you'd have 100,000k rift items to purify a bunch of shit with
[4:23:42] <$joylent_blue> just walk through the door
[4:23:46] <+DFDEDSDCD> Do the first room

[4:24:28] <DracaenaLeaf> oh boy
[4:24:29] <+thebestestkevin> considering how important levels are in this game, im not sure if pats statement is all that accurate?

[4:25:01] <+krispen_wa> there's actually a player who got through BBI without doing any story so its doable
[4:25:03] <+RadSuit> "That's a lady yelling water."
[4:25:06] <ChatNinja> pretty sure the purple waypoint at this point only shows up if you're on bitterblack isle
[4:25:12] <$serpenttucker> @nekodelic You can run through the areas too. You'd be surprised by how many area's don't require you to actually fight to progress.
[4:25:16] <Graxe_> The purple only appears in BBI now from this point on, I think?
[4:25:16] <+CapnCarnivore> @PeachSaliva Pat, what is your favorite class? I'm a warrior guy myself because super armor is stronk

[4:26:15] <nekodelic> MAGICK ARCHER MOTHERFUCKER
[4:26:15] <+RushUnplugged> (literally every advanced class is awesome though)
[4:26:17] <Everpresent_Overseer> I like Mystic Knight for Runes
[4:26:19] <+CaptainJax> mystick knight chads > magick archer virgins
[4:26:21] <+krispen_wa> Magick archer became the most overpowered thanks to tiny hallways
[4:26:22] <Shemegory> pat didn't even let her see the cute dogs in the isle
[4:26:24] <+bustawof> i love how destructive and terrifying the final spells are in this game
[4:26:34] <rhysbrando> I recommend a good healer and a good ranged pawn, and I had an easier time going through here with magick archer
[4:26:36] <+Kirbachev> When did the Assassin get nerfed?
[4:26:36] <Graxe_> They reduced the time for Invisiblity and the strength buff of Autonomy.
[4:26:36] <+DFDEDSDCD> Still purple on minimap
[4:26:38] <OwlLightningMage> ASSASSIN WAS SO FUCKED
[4:26:40] <@PlagueOfGripes> the classes in dragon's dogma aren't balanced at all, or that well designed
[4:26:44] <+krispen_wa> it got nerfed when DA came out
[4:26:50] <+levit8960> @peachsaliva yo pat sry to bug you but did my donation message come through? if so could you read it out loud on stream, id really appreciate it
[4:26:52] <+CaptainJax> pat let her change to warrior
[4:26:52] <+krispen_wa> the solo damage buff got reduced to 20%
[4:26:54] <+krispen_wa> really bad
[4:27:03] <leviathan666303> tusk toss tho
[4:27:05] <+Kirbachev> Ah, okay. I only played with DA on the PC, so it's whatever to me. Can't miss what you never had.
[4:27:12] <nekodelic> @krispen_wa ricochet hunter spam involves skill and it's totally not a way to cheese the game Kappa
[4:27:30] <+thebestestkevin> im still pissed that greatswords only get like 2 special moves MAX
[4:27:37] <orkky> ranger tenfold flurry with blast arrows op
[4:27:39] <OwlLightningMage> Balance is for cowards
[4:27:42] <$joylent_blue> don't actually look at how to use the new attack though Kappa
[4:27:45] <Logan_Jennings1> Pat want skill.
[4:27:46] <+krispen_wa> but the one special move is all you need
[4:27:54] <+krispen_wa> arc of deliverance bay bay
[4:28:01] <+RushUnplugged> greatswords having limited moves sucks, but warrior is literally the "too angry to die" class
[4:28:04] <darkslide44> Run run away
[4:28:08] <+CapnCarnivore> @krispen_wa mah man.
[4:28:15] <+CapnCarnivore> or woman
[4:28:16] <$serpenttucker> ...
[4:28:17] <%Coystick> @PlagueOfGripes Brother have you seen Mystic Knight? You smack ki orbs to shoot lasers
[4:28:17] <+CapnCarnivore> I dunno
[4:28:20] <DesuDesuDokiDoki> HUUYHH?
[4:28:20] <cerberuscarmine> wew
[4:28:22] <%bloodypurpledog> sipsipGears sipsipGears sipsipGears
[4:28:22] <OwlLightningMage> Paige will LOVE Warrior
[4:28:28] <@SSaryn> INTO THE WATER
[4:28:31] <+CaptainJax> aught
[4:28:33] <$joylent_blue> oh NO her dialogue overlapped itself
[4:28:43] <Minorou> Arc of Deliverance is one of the coolest names of an attack
[4:28:46] <+krispen_wa> BEAR SEEK SEEK LEST
[4:28:46] <Shemegory> night walker
[4:28:48] <cerberuscarmine> go into the wataaaaa
[4:28:50] <+Kirbachev> Blitterlack.
[4:28:52] <+Solutha> Throw pat into the water
[4:28:53] <@SSaryn> plez go in watur, it cold.
[4:28:54] <Graxe_> That gif of a Warrior one-shotting a griffin mid-divebomb is so good.
[4:28:57] <orkky> Arc of Obliteration
[4:28:57] <Bouldus> o//
[4:29:02] <+DFDEDSDCD> You can stone over to BBI after a while if I remember correctly.
[4:29:05] <$joylent_blue> she almost fell LUL
[4:29:06] <+krispen_wa> that whole 1-shot video is good
[4:29:13] <@SSaryn> Damn it I'm trying to get her to do a flip into the water.
[4:29:14] <Logan_Jennings1> PAIGE DO IT PLUS ULTRA

[4:29:29] <+DFDEDSDCD> Do the well quest at night
[4:29:30] <+CapnCarnivore> Warrior is that Pop-Team epic panel where she's all "in one minute your life will fucking end" and then she's just standing there
[4:29:40] <deathsmions1> morning from engalnd
[4:29:44] <deathsmions1> england
[4:29:45] <Graxe_> Don't forget about Madeleine. At night, she's upstairs in the room.
[4:29:46] <+Nomicro4u> GOBLIN RAID
[4:29:48] <+bustawof> but the supershot attack that sacrifices your pawn tho
[4:29:48] <+MechaBaphomet> GOBLIN

[4:30:24] <+Nomicro4u> WHAT IS A WELL? IS IT LIKE A GOBOLIN?
[4:30:24] <OwlLightningMage> I don't actually think she's strong enough for that
[4:30:31] <Graxe_> Aw yeah, the well.

[4:31:07] <+CapnCarnivore> @SSaryn despite this being a japanese game... I have to agree this game feels like eurojank
[4:31:17] <b1gboss007> WUT MATE, YOU GOING DOWN
[4:31:19] <Zombrocom> Strike the tail arisen!
[4:31:20] <%jiin6> hey cousin

[4:31:46] <Pandapanda92> TURN BRIGHTNESS BACK DOWN
[4:31:50] <$joylent_blue> oh my god
[4:31:52] <+CapnCarnivore> oh mah gawd
[4:31:52] <@SSaryn> Dragons Dogma has the best eurojank out of any Japanese game I've ever seen and how they did it is mind blowing to me.
[4:31:58] <+robert_edwards> this is hell
[4:31:58] <%The_Lady_Alustriel> these menus NotLikeThis
[4:32:06] <DatAsuna> madama butterlfy
[4:32:07] <@PlagueOfGripes> I'd replay Dragon's Dogma, but I really don't want to deal with its bullshit
[4:32:08] <$joylent_blue> BEFO-
[4:32:09] <+Max_Kaiser> LUL
[4:32:12] <%jiin6> Never mind
[4:32:13] <%bloodypurpledog> The gators annihilated me the first time I went down there
[4:32:23] <derap41> The worst
[4:32:29] <$joylent_blue> oh my GOD
[4:32:31] <%jiin6> here in the barn
[4:32:32] <+Nomicro4u> SHES GONNA DUMP PAT FOR A STRONGER DWARF?
[4:32:33] <+CapnCarnivore> Don't be Matt, Paige
[4:32:38] <TheMilhouseExperience> Gun jumping for everyone.
[4:32:39] <+DFDEDSDCD> TIME TO REUP YOUR PAWNS. Or buy better ones
[4:32:45] <OwlLightningMage> Throw these pawns in the fucking trash
[4:32:46] <DesuDesuDokiDoki> blindness imprisoning me all that i see
[4:32:51] <derap41> Discard them like the objects they are
[4:32:52] <Luesagna00> someone make better peach!
[4:32:55] <DatAsuna> Fun thing about the pawn system
[4:32:55] <nekodelic> Dragon's Dogma lasts like 4 hours if you skip everything you don't need to do in ng+
[4:32:56] <+thebestestkevin> dragons dogma leveling system actively works against the ideas of its combat
[4:32:59] <Logan_Jennings1> Byeeeeee
[4:33:02] <DatAsuna> you have to pay for pawns higher level than your own but
[4:33:06] <rhysbrando> could throw em in the ocean and fire them like I do
[4:33:07] <+SchlomoGoldbergsteinowitz> Fuck you, me
[4:33:08] <DatAsuna> not if they'reo yur friends list
[4:33:11] <+Nomicro4u> Hate to see her go
[4:33:14] <%jiin6> Bye Nun paige
[4:33:14] <+Nomicro4u> but love to watch her walk away
[4:33:15] <wheke_> look at elmo how nice the baby is!!!!!!
[4:33:16] <+bustawof> Used and replaced just how i like mah ghost slaves
[4:33:17] <DatAsuna> so your friend can just give you a free level 200
[4:33:17] <+DFDEDSDCD> Before you finish the game look at your log of pawns you used.
[4:33:24] <+CapnCarnivore> is she online? @PeachSaliva
[4:33:24] <$serpenttucker> She didn't get rid of the first...
[4:33:26] <+federleicht> bailey is everywhere
[4:33:32] <derap41> NOT worth it
[4:33:32] <nekodelic> dragon's dogma leveling system is the only real BAD thing of the game
[4:33:36] <%HDmexiqtioner> Hi everyone. Feels good to be back.
[4:33:43] <helpmeimafruit> CICERO
[4:33:46] <Ropcord> fuck the heals, give me the buffs
[4:33:52] <$joylent_blue> always anodyne
[4:33:55] <Graxe_> Not if you have the damage output like with four sorcerers.
[4:33:55] <Maxicqwe> why so mean :(
[4:34:01] <EASrake> Sweet sweet anodyne
[4:34:01] <OwlLightningMage> Fire PogChamp
[4:34:01] <Ryo_no_Kage> Look. At. The. Baby!
[4:34:03] <+SchlomoGoldbergsteinowitz> The way damage/defense is calculated is my biggest gripe about DD
[4:34:05] <faegbeard> Searching is for scrubs, just pick pawns up that are there.
[4:34:15] <+st_judge> You don't need healing that badly since items exist
[4:34:17] <faegbeard> And tell the ones you don't want to fuck off.
[4:34:17] <+DFDEDSDCD> get anodyne and fire boon
[4:34:17] <@SSaryn> Frazil and Thunder Boon is great, has Anodyne on secondary is fucking awesome.
[4:34:18] <Zombrocom> Don't need healing if everything is dead to tornados and meteors *tap forhead*
[4:34:20] <nekodelic> tfw I went through the whole game with a magick archer as main and a fighter as pawn
[4:34:21] <+DFDEDSDCD> great for start
[4:34:21] <%SuichiTanaka> Anodyne and Holy Affinity are the most useful at this low level
[4:34:27] <orkky> frazil bad
[4:34:30] <derap41> Must have antidote
[4:34:36] <$joylent_blue> frazil is big bad
[4:34:38] <Ropcord> BOON BIG GOOD
[4:34:39] <$serpenttucker> ffs
[4:34:42] <+DFDEDSDCD> For the well get ice though.
[4:34:43] <SPidERMan8576> someone make an elmo pawn
[4:34:44] <+CapnCarnivore> @Graxe_ you just made me realize why pawns can't be hybrid classes. because imagine 4 mystic knights all comboing their orbs
[4:34:48] <wsintai> oh boy the lupis is doing big today
[4:34:53] <@SSaryn> Frazil is GOOD for right now.
[4:34:54] <nekodelic> get ice, you're gonna fight some gaytors
[4:34:56] <+krispen_wa> CRAIG BOONE
[4:35:15] <@SSaryn> Frazil is bad any other time of the day, but it's good RIGHT NOW.
[4:35:16] <+SchlomoGoldbergsteinowitz> Gators HATE being cold
[4:35:32] <$joylent_blue> a Craig Boone is when the enemy just gets fucking headshotted from a mile away
[4:35:41] <derap41> dps mage
[4:35:43] <Ropcord> man i just remembered how fucking broken magic knight is
[4:35:43] <+thebestestkevin> I think the thing that made me turned off from the game was running into basic bandits and water enemies that killed me in two hits and took a million years to kill individually
[4:35:45] <%Coystick> @CapnCarnivore no nut nov I can't afford to imagine thta
[4:35:47] <ChatNinja> Pat any comment on Dragons Dogma Online?
[4:35:48] <+spiegelspike> scarlet kissu
[4:35:55] <+CapnCarnivore> Are they playing online?
[4:35:55] <+Bhpicasso1> DRAGONS DOGMA Pog
[4:35:59] <nekodelic> Frazil is good when you can just cheese it from the top of a rock
[4:36:03] <+thebestestkevin> and then i leveled up a few times and curbstomped them
[4:36:10] <derap41> should be a dps mage in that case
[4:36:19] <CurrySauseBandit> Let her try it out
[4:36:20] <+MMetas> pat said mages are support
[4:36:22] <+MMetas> HAH
[4:36:23] <%SuichiTanaka> Another mage is fine, just get one with damage skills
[4:36:25] <Graxe_> But you can have a support mage and a dps mage.
[4:36:40] <Graxe_> And Anodyne fields stack.
[4:36:41] <+MMetas> They support your house by killing everything maybe
[4:36:44] <+DFDEDSDCD> Or shell out some points (If you have enought) for a sorcerer
[4:36:50] <+MMetas> Pat doesnt know the truth
[4:36:54] <+MMetas> you should have all dps mages
[4:36:59] <helpmeimafruit> it's Paul Blart
[4:37:01] <+MMetas> and upgrade to all dps sorcerers
[4:37:02] <+RushUnplugged> man seeing multiple sorcs combo spells and demolish monsters is ajoy
[4:37:05] <DracaenaLeaf> sloot
[4:37:05] <+levit8960> i recently turned 21 anim in the happiest place ive been in a long tine. i was in a rough place a year ago but now im very lucky to be surrounded with positivity and people i love, and who love me. i want to say everyone in this stream deserves to be happy and loved by the people around them. God bless every single one of you.
[4:37:08] <derap41> bewbies
[4:37:11] <+CapnCarnivore> @PeachSaliva I dunno if you guys are playing online or not, but these pawns don't look like freakazoids so I'd imagine not
[4:37:13] <+krispen_wa> Isn't Jonquil the name of that one OMikron city
[4:37:14] <TheMilhouseExperience> !hooker
[4:37:16] <EASrake> Let's play... WAIFU or WEIRDO

[4:37:40] <+Max_Kaiser> Couldn't get out fast enough
[4:37:44] <+MMetas> Does pat know you can make the mages cast aoe spells faster if they all channel at the same time?
