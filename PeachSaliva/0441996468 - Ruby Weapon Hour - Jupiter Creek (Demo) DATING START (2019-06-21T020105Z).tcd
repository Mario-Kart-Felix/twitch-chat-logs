[0:48:45] <ShichiNoBushi> I wouldn't be surprised if you can include Johnny Bravo in the "doesn't know what sex is" category not just because he's a children's cartoon character.

[0:49:49] <+ItsRatman> polygraphs are bullshit, why do people still use them
[0:49:51] <Lamedhos> Hypnotize yourself
[0:49:52] <slaydolf_critler> People use polygraphs to trick people into giving a confession
[0:49:54] <agiantpileoftrash> It’s bullshit

[0:49:54] <+Shady_Zaku> Why are you doing a polygraph???
[0:49:55] <blue6sub6remnant6> So tactically void bowels right off the bat?

[0:50:09] <%ElenaManetta> NO THANKS
[0:50:11] <+sixcubit> @PeachSaliva they're RIDICULOUSLY inaccurate. basically useless except to get people to confess on their own
[0:50:14] <spawnzie> Jokes on you I'm always freakin out
[0:50:14] <UhneekAnieke> okay nerd Pat
[0:50:15] <Ion_Laser> @LiquidMathew Not yet
[0:50:15] <GhostPyre> Ocean's 11
[0:50:16] <$Micalica> Polygraph tests can be exceedingly inaccurate. Any court or legal proceeding using them shouldn't take them seriously.
[0:50:16] <PopulousNix> polygraph machine was made as a party trick anyhow
[0:50:16] <haveswordmuststing> @itsratman because it gets results, so why invest in something different Kappa
[0:50:20] <Moonlight_Grimoire> polygraphs are inadmissible in court, so why are you having one?
[0:50:21] <%Naotox10> @PeachSaliva Getting ready for your date huh?
[0:50:21] <$Piemono> I've heard you can just clench your asshole, which changes your pulse
[0:50:22] <King_Wolf_Rigger> Pro-tip: Think about what your mom would think if you lied. Then don't.
[0:50:22] <%depressed_skeleton> neeeeeeeeeeeeerd
[0:50:25] <Kirby_Sauce> @ItsRatman because people believe it works
[0:50:26] <mybigmeech> He stole Paige's glasses monkaS
[0:50:30] <%KilljoyHexx> so if you are in pain the whole time...
[0:50:31] <fighterman> clench butthole every 3.5 seconds
[0:50:31] <try_it_sis_> DORK
[0:50:31] <themightyseptopus> Clench your butthole a lot ruins the results
[0:50:35] <%starotter70> Ha
[0:50:35] <$rdark_ksu> they are bullshit
[0:50:37] <+cosinity> Mythbusters tested various ways to beat polygraphs a while back, I forget what was best though
[0:50:38] <OwlLightningMage> Nooooo
[0:50:39] <JJnAJjohnson> NOPE
[0:50:42] <gustavozxd> CONFESSION TAPES
[0:50:42] <hntronium> @PeachSaliva Hey Pat check out the Railith pic that he just drew
[0:50:42] <$BayowolfTerra> no they cannot
[0:50:42] <+TheMattman1313> They're more of a deterrant
[0:50:43] <Mr_Strut> Also deny everything in the post polygraph interview
[0:50:45] <TheFilth> look at the squiggles Judge!
[0:50:45] <Badgerconda_> ironically, GOVERNMENT SECURITY CLEARANCES utilize polygraphs.
[0:50:46] <+redstonej> they are allowed in bird court
[0:50:46] <ExpressNode> In Canadian court or US court?
[0:50:48] <Coystick> Polygraphs are a MEME
[0:50:49] <+InstiGaitan> hell and I cannot stress this enough no
[0:50:50] <$RubberFistFight> Pat is right - they're a tool to coerce a confession.
[0:50:50] <AMajorTom> It's mostly theater to unnerve you
[0:50:52] <$nobunagaesq> Just take a deep breath and be honest. Take it slow and don't fret to much about right and wrong answers. you'll likely get a chance to explain your answers if there is a concern or discrepancy
[0:50:54] <haveswordmuststing> not to mention that one guy used a polygraph to measure plant emotions
[0:51:02] <+jerree66> It's true
[0:51:02] <Kirby_Sauce> It's all a head game
[0:51:02] <$SvenHolgersson> in short fuck pigs
[0:51:05] <Huntercd> What fetish we talking about
[0:51:07] <$GarbageNirvana> And yet I still had to take one to get my security clearance when I was with the Air Force

[0:51:11] <%AncelDeLambert> As Penn and Teller put it: It's Bad Cop Good Cop with the polygraph being the Bad Cop

[0:51:23] <%Ell1ot> Amazon women tried to throw Johnny Bravo into a volcano as a virgin sacrifice but it spit him back out, implying that Johnny Bravo got laid at some point off screen
[0:51:25] <Luesagna00> @peachsaliva lie detector test? yeah even the inventor admitted that the machine is not reliable.
[0:51:25] <EuropantLamprey> It's just to trick people into confessions
