[0:06:29] <@SoFarFetched> LUL
[0:06:30] <thescrubking27> Pats vtuber is gonna be one of those potato people from ff14
[0:06:31] <cherrycottontail> hey pat can you make lyon drop his note in castrum i hate my life
[0:06:42] <+KingKrampus> I'd think VTUBER pat would be a hamtaro hamster
[0:06:44] <%RealThiele> pats vtuber should just be a rat ina  toilet
[0:06:49] <%dankjerri> well, nowadays you get to 30 before youre done with the tutorial dungekns
[0:06:53] <+the_drummaestro> @SoFarFetched I'm an idiot ty
[0:07:00] <thescrubking27> Hamtaro pat. Yes
[0:07:05] <$DocMadfox> I continue to wish I enjoyed this game. The gameplay's great but dear god is the story not for me.
[0:07:07] <+KingKrampus> @thescrubking27 the weird adult children?
[0:07:12] <waltzqueen> @PatStaresAt if you had to vTube, what are you gonna be?
[0:07:14] <SolumFuturae> @RealThiele maybe just the toilet
[0:07:23] <thescrubking27> @kingkrampus yeah those ones
[0:07:30] <MarylandJutsu> YAY back to Eorzea with PAIIIIIGE
[0:07:38] <SolumFuturae> Riding HOOOOOOOME
[0:07:42] <@SoFarFetched> also reminder please no story stuff talk in chat if she's not there yet.
[0:07:43] <rustybuckethead21> Lalafel (i think that's what is called) Pat when??? also, hey chat koefLurk
[0:07:45] <%samTUMZfestival> Paaaaaaaat
[0:07:53] <+Grayhammatter> paaaaaaatuh
[0:07:54] <%pepperbeelady> @patstaresat can you give Zan a big old lovepat from me?
[0:07:59] <waltzqueen> Paaaaaaaaatuh
[0:07:59] <MarylandJutsu> @SoFarFetched oh yeah far, why'd she choose lancer?
[0:08:02] <%dankjerri> pat would never do a lalafell
[0:08:09] <@CreepyPorpoise> @rustybuckethead21 as soon as lalas get to be balding with a big beard
[0:08:10] <omega_reddu> But he did
[0:08:15] <+KingKrampus> lalafels have too much hair on their heads, not enough beard, for pat
[0:08:26] <%RealThiele> Patorito
[0:08:32] <%dankjerri> if he was plainsfolk he could do mutton chops
[0:08:33] <@SoFarFetched> Look dragoons be cool Kappa and paige wanted to be cool
[0:08:43] <MarylandJutsu> @SoFarFetched ......so someone lied to her
[0:08:46] <MarylandJutsu> sigh
[0:08:47] <ReiSuji> bawkDance
[0:08:49] <@SoFarFetched> she will JUMP
[0:08:54] <@SoFarFetched> ....and forget to come back down
[0:08:57] <rustybuckethead21> but still, lalafell pat vtuber when????
[0:09:01] <MarylandJutsu> you mean jump OFF the map
[0:09:05] <%cobalt_phoenix_> is it because she has a tendency to hurt herself like dragoons? be honest now
[0:09:07] <YakumoYomi> Kappa
[0:09:07] <+KingKrampus> @dankjerri why would pat not be a lalafell? because there's no appreciable difference to IRL?
[0:09:11] <@SoFarFetched> but seriously I assume she was interested in lancer/dragoon
[0:09:13] <Ultralazuli> pat would be a toilet vtuber
[0:09:16] <%dankjerri> we love when paige accidentally kills herself in game, theres no job better at it
[0:09:17] <MarylandJutsu> lol I know far
[0:09:25] <@SoFarFetched> geefLul
[0:09:33] <%cobalt_phoenix_> for real tho im liking this so far
[0:09:34] <%BinaryFireball> BinaryFireball subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 23 months! So I'm about to embark on my own evo journey. Seeing as how you recently watched all of it for the first time would you say it's ok to watch the movies first ? or do I really need to watch the tv series before? Anyways keep on rockin, rockin the beat
[0:09:34] <%RealThiele> every moment of being a dragoon brings you one step closer to accidentally going into space
[0:09:35] <+Grayhammatter> we like the jumps
[0:09:37] <GarbageQueenEllie> Yeaaah boiii moar Bunbuns
[0:09:38] <thescrubking27> Lalafel with a can of red bull and the get smoked hat will be pats vtuber
[0:09:39] <@SoFarFetched> cause Im sure she got the breakdown of what classes lead to what
[0:09:42] <%pepperbeelady> also hullo all PrideTake PrideWingR
[0:09:43] <CappuccinoGuil> @KingKrampus I can't see him making a lalafell that looks like him. At least Roe has like, the stocky built and good beard options
[0:09:50] <rizintaco> Even odds says Peach starts macking on Minfilia as soon as she can
[0:09:53] <MarylandJutsu> the Pat breakdown ifyou will Far?
[0:09:59] <%dankjerri> isnt her favorite character Kain?
[0:10:00] <+dragoon001914> Miqo'te > almost every other option
[0:10:01] <MarylandJutsu> I forget do you play 14 too Far?

[0:14:22] <%dankjerri> cancel culture, by Voltaire
[0:14:26] <%samTUMZfestival> NERDS read poetry. It's about BARS
[0:14:26] <Latija> her tweet is stupid but who even cares
[0:14:26] <@CreepyPorpoise> People got so mad that she dared say that not all art has to have purpose and meaning and be E L E V A T E D
[0:14:28] <GarbageQueenEllie> The poetry nerds that fired her are pussies
[0:14:30] <%pepperbeelady> she's not wrong
[0:14:31] <cherrycottontail> as always, publications hate when you are TRUE AND REAL
[0:14:32] <%Lets_frown> But, that's true.
[0:14:39] <@CreepyPorpoise> but as someone who draws anime boobies...
[0:14:41] <@SoFarFetched> @MarylandJutsu thank you geefSmush I was actually supposed to stream today but I was like "no not feeling well geefNLT "
[0:14:42] <SpaceCapnCrone> Excuse me but poetry recharges my devil trigger.
[0:14:44] <%Calek> I bet she likes to write poetry for MONEY
[0:14:44] <MarylandJutsu> @CreepyPorpoise wow....the audacity truly
[0:14:45] <%BinaryFireball> the plums in the fridge
[0:14:47] <+VictorVonLouche> probably not the full picture as it's twitter
[0:14:50] <cherrycottontail> No, she said that poetry is a circlejerk and no one else cares
[0:14:52] <%dankjerri> i wrote a poem about my dick once, how is that powerful
[0:14:54] <%RealThiele> how daaaaare you say our niche art is niche
[0:14:56] <+KingKrampus> @thejimjamz after a half year of streams all we see are a giant pair of boobs that talk
[0:15:00] <+logoth_> Everything is pitchforks these days
[0:15:00] <Monkeyweed21> everyone with talent went to hip hop so the poetry community has just gone rotten the last 30 or 40 years
[0:15:01] <%BinaryFireball> poetry is kinda dead
[0:15:02] <thescrubking27> That’s like... such a lukewarm take. She got fired for that?
[0:15:06] <%Hobojo153> But that's true though
[0:15:12] <%VashyronM> it can definitely be
[0:15:12] <%Lets_frown> @PeachSaliva It's Big Poetry, coming down on the little poets
[0:15:13] <GarbageQueenEllie> Poetry IS a circlejerk, and that's why ppl love it
[0:15:14] <+UberWolfman> Someone had an axe to grind
[0:15:15] <dan_g_v> Pat loves poetry
[0:15:16] <%Lets_frown> LUL
[0:15:16] <jorniev> MAGAZINE WAS CALLED BARREN, LIKE peoples usual interest for poetry
[0:15:16] <SolumFuturae> What she says extends to most writing outside of poetry.
[0:15:17] <MarylandJutsu> I think she said somehitng....more family appropriate
[0:15:19] <bingusdadingus> Rap is poems
[0:15:23] <+PenmanLupine> she was saying the only people paying attention to poetry were poets so messages weren't reaching any kind of relevant audience.

[0:19:30] <%BinaryFireball> Bezos wants me to watch the movies first
[0:19:33] <$Sphincter_Spelunker> I don't know why you would watch anime movies before a show first , anyway
[0:19:37] <Tracazoid> Tvseries->End of Evangelion->Rebuild movies
[0:19:38] <%DianaTheAscian> I surprised this is confusing for people
[0:19:40] <jorniev> trust the author
[0:19:42] <SpaceCapnCrone> Bezos is a philistine
[0:19:46] <Zeif00> Tv - End of - Moobies
[0:19:51] <MarylandJutsu> shit be wack yo
[0:19:51] <%Ranryu692> you can skip  Death and Rebirth because it's a recap movie plus the first half of End of Eva
[0:19:54] <%thejimjamz> @DianaTheAscian nothing about eva is simple
[0:19:55] <%hewlettfan96> How are the rebuild movies
[0:20:00] <+dragoon001914> Release order for any form of media
[0:20:02] <%Garthunox> cheer500 Just curious Paige, have you seen the original ARR opening cinematic? by that i mean the one that plays when you leave the screen on the main menu, ask pat if you're unsure, its amazing and shows the final moments of the original FFXIV
[0:20:02] <@SoFarFetched> @DianaTheAscian I mean we did have that one person with the hottest take that the EVA watch order was more difficult than Kingdom Hearts LUL
[0:20:03] <%samTUMZfestival> Invincible goes legit non-con...
[0:20:04] <jorniev> i still havent watched the last film
[0:20:06] <%GalacticaPhanto> I would eat Bezos like Eva 001 did
[0:20:08] <MarylandJutsu> release order is usually right
[0:20:13] <dan_g_v> no wai

[0:20:45] <jorniev> pen pen
[0:20:50] <%hewlettfan96> Is it necessary to watch the previous evangelion rebuild films before I watch evangelion 3.0??
[0:20:50] <MarylandJutsu> I'm so proud of your thoughts
[0:21:00] <coreyyotto> I don't know if we could handle the games of dignity chicken that would come out of a Peach/Pat Eva spoilercast
[0:21:05] <@SoFarFetched> @hewlettfan96 yes if you forgot a lot of it.
[0:21:06] <%GalacticaPhanto> I actually like Mari as best girl
[0:21:10] <%DianaTheAscian> @SoFarFetched I guess but I would think since the movies have names like 3.000183(Butts)02 or something it would be obvious at to what you watch first
[0:21:25] <MarylandJutsu> Best girl is OBVIOUSLY  the house penguin
[0:21:26] <jorniev> have you watched like MONSTER?
[0:21:27] <SolumFuturae> I would probably be in a better place if I didn't watch it when i was 10
[0:21:29] <+chill_o_wisp> I would consider Eva to be the closest thing to true "art" ever created by people

[0:23:58] <%Agami23> paige, do you know about the SCP that is an infinite ikea? it never ends.

[0:24:00] <%hewlettfan96> @sofarfetched What u mean?
[0:24:01] <@JustinianKnight> "I have to go to Ikea"
[0:24:05] <+Grayhammatter> the food court at ikea is so good

[0:25:02] <@SoFarFetched> I thought you were gonna say the meowsma
[0:25:05] <+Ynkubus_> What kind of Ikeas have you guys been going to? Is the one I'm at an aberration, I've never experience ikea rage.

[0:25:13] <%Lets_frown> There are arrows on the ground Paige.
[0:25:14] <Mortal_Wombat_I> That place is engineered to manipulate you no cap
[0:25:19] <%samTUMZfestival> IKEA is a Seinfeld episode waiting to happen.
[0:25:19] <%pepperbeelady> mustard would never do that to the Queen
[0:25:23] <MarylandJutsu> ok good
[0:25:25] <%DianaTheAscian> I've never seen the hotdogs at Ikea
[0:25:27] <+kyh9> Does Gaia Online count as an MMO?
[0:25:28] <MarylandJutsu> just wanted to check
[0:25:30] <$Sphincter_Spelunker> get leftovers ready
[0:25:39] <@JustinianKnight> nah Gaia was just a forum
[0:25:40] <%pepperbeelady> omh gaia xD
[0:25:43] <+kyh9> I think my first MMO was either FFXI or some really shitty chinese MMO from 2005
[0:25:46] <@SoFarFetched> yeah gaia was mainly forum

[0:26:36] <%hewlettfan96> @sofarfetched I see should I accept it as it’s own continuity? Or considering the canon mindfuck that is Eva does it even matter? Evangelion 2.0 is a direct sequel to EoE I hear
[0:26:38] <Monkeyweed21> the pineapple juice sent you down to 6

[0:28:34] <Futurecity10> Primal is the normie/internet famous server
[0:28:35] <ShadyIMG> I'm on Exclaibur myself.

[0:28:38] <+UberWolfman> We also have RP venues

[0:28:43] <%strugglepunk2> @samTUMZfestival balmung is the right answer here
[0:28:44] <%dankjerri> they still very much do
[0:28:44] <%CopperTucker> yes
[0:28:46] <%miabyte> Rebb has been trying to convince me to data center hop to Primal
[0:28:47] <%DianaTheAscian> Famfrit has the Jades
[0:28:48] <+kyh9> Ultros has a reputation for mustard-chugging bunny girls going around and being absurd
[0:28:49] <%Dakuu75> dodge mf-ers~
[0:28:50] <+alphonseisbest> yes
[0:28:50] <MarylandJutsu> @PeachSaliva better than balmung
[0:28:50] <SpaceCapnCrone> Ultros is in the small backwater data center
[0:28:52] <%dankjerri> balmung is still the RP server
[0:28:55] <+dragoon001914> Balmung has been known as the ERP server for YEARS
[0:28:55] <+axenred> oh wow! before the server split and my world was separated, every asshole i ever met was on ultros!
[0:28:56] <+Nekros4442> Server identiies still exist
[0:28:56] <GarbageQueenEllie> Where's the server that has the Theatre nerds w/ misplaced sexual energy?
[0:28:59] <RyuuAoi> Boobie slider go up?
[0:29:04] <@CreepyPorpoise> Yeah, no one wants to play on Primal
[0:29:06] <+Nekros4442> @GarbageQueenEllie Crystal
[0:29:10] <%strugglepunk2> @GarbageQueenEllie Faerie
[0:29:10] <@JustinianKnight> its less backwater than some of the other Primal ones tho
[0:29:12] <%dankjerri> @garbagequeenellie balmung
[0:29:13] <%samTUMZfestival> Nice; it sounds fun.
[0:29:13] <%valerios_> @Dakuu75 hey!! thanks very much for the gift sub limesHug
[0:29:13] <$JoshManVGH> Crossdatacenter will come with the expansion. Cross server is currently a thing.
[0:29:14] <@JustinianKnight> we're not Lamia
[0:29:15] <+alphonseisbest> yup
[0:29:15] <@JustinianKnight> lol
[0:29:16] <ShadyIMG> You joined at amazing time.
[0:29:17] <MarylandJutsu> Yes they have reps and not cross server yet
[0:29:17] <+kyh9> Yes
[0:29:18] <%Ranryu692> @GarbageQueenEllie so the RP server?
[0:29:19] <%SveriSageAdvice> what who said that
[0:29:20] <@CreepyPorpoise> we don't have the big erp server
[0:29:20] <$Sphincter_Spelunker> Role Play servers atpCap
[0:29:21] <%SveriSageAdvice> how dare
[0:29:25] <+alphonseisbest> it stinky
[0:29:25] <+dragoon001914> Aether gang where we @
[0:29:27] <%Rachet20> Primal is the best server
[0:29:27] <%walternatorz> all the new players stressed the servers too much to the point they don't want to stress it further with new data center switching
[0:29:27] <@CreepyPorpoise> or the "raiding scene"
[0:29:28] <GarbageQueenEllie> @Ranryu692 Basically yea
[0:29:28] <+kyh9> Primal and Balmung are where the ROLE PLAYERS are
[0:29:30] <@SoFarFetched> sounds like someone who couldn't  get into Primal Kappa
[0:29:32] <+kyh9> Especially THOSE role players
[0:29:37] <%Rachet20> Thats why we're all there now
[0:29:38] <%Garthunox> no one wants to play on NA servers full stop
[0:29:41] <MarylandJutsu> only almung is the wierd one
[0:29:44] <Rumbutt> because Primal is the middle of the road, isn't the fully erp dc, isn't the fully hardcore raid dc
[0:29:45] <%Agami23> not a ton of streamers on primal, though offline TV were talking about going with primal for their playing
[0:29:47] <@JustinianKnight> its just kinda nicely in the middle of everything
[0:29:47] <%Garthunox> NA raiding is ASS
[0:29:48] <MarylandJutsu> too many people in Primal
[0:29:49] <+alphonseisbest> :O
[0:29:49] <+kyh9> Stay away from me catgirls (male).  Stop dancing at me
[0:29:50] <demiiluna> Crystal is the roleplay dc, not Primal
[0:29:50] <%BinaryFireball> HOW?!?!?!
[0:29:50] <$Sphincter_Spelunker> it's cool
[0:29:52] <%Ranryu692> it's surprisingly good
[0:29:52] <bob900000> me neither
[0:29:55] <+alphonseisbest> WATCH IT
[0:29:56] <$JoshManVGH> Like I hopped over from Leviathan to Ultros to say hi during your debut. I have no idea what my server is known for.
[0:29:57] <SolumFuturae> still easier to raid on primal than crystal
[0:29:57] <%DianaTheAscian> I forget what data center I'm in
[0:29:59] <+alphonseisbest> it good
[0:29:59] <RyuuAoi> Never seen it
[0:30:02] <@SoFarFetched> its okay I haven't watched a lot of movies either
[0:30:02] <+kyh9> Blade Runner 1 is boring but atmospheric
[0:30:03] <demiiluna> Primal is the red-headed stepchild data center.
[0:30:03] <coreyyotto> adhd be like that
[0:30:04] <%BinaryFireball> Harrison Ford is hot back then!
[0:30:09] <%SveriSageAdvice> so people are upset that Primal is the chill server where you can do whatever you want?? lol
[0:30:09] <$NitronStreams> I havent seen bladerunner either
[0:30:12] <MarylandJutsu> Bladerunner is GREAT
[0:30:14] <Explodincatz> super overrated
[0:30:16] <MarylandJutsu> WATCH IT PAIGE
[0:30:16] <+kyh9> Blade Runner 1 wanted to be a video game before video games
[0:30:17] <%strugglepunk2> @SoFarFetched farfetched, i managed to make a road to 70 buff character on balmung, man. Nothing surprises me anymore
[0:30:18] <@JustinianKnight> oh yea, you can watch the 1.0 movie as well
[0:30:22] <%thejimjamz> For a time a thought Blade Runner was a movie about roller blades

[0:37:50] <+alphonseisbest> yes

[0:37:51] <%SlagChambers> @Grayhammatter wait, is Ross on this server?
[0:37:51] <+logoth_> This is why I prefer keyboard and mouse
[0:37:53] <%Treuan> Yup
[0:37:53] <stormhawk9891> It takes a bit to settle in
[0:37:54] <%Shotgun_Hobo1> sipsipSipsipblind sipsipSipsipblind
[0:37:56] <+Taisuru> Teleport
[0:37:59] <theshillman> oh god she's already doing the sad "huuugh" noises
[0:38:09] <WordsHere> I used controller for a little bit and then gave up on it
[0:38:14] <@JustinianKnight> I used controller but mouse for certain things if its easier
[0:38:17] <shinji_ifrit> I need the job action trailer so bad, gimmeeeee

[0:38:46] <%dankjerri> bentbranch
[0:38:46] <buddhistmetal> that's it

[0:40:21] <+axenred> if you see an enemy with a symbol after is name, kill it! including those level 7 enemies!
[0:40:21] <Xenokun> E G G

[0:41:12] <%AncelDeLambert> "chi-guh" is how I pronounce it, but I am a lemon, so who knows
[0:41:14] <demiiluna> Chigoe: a tropical flea, the female of which burrows and lays eggs beneath the host's skin, causing painful sores.
[0:41:29] <%dankjerri> a chocobo to bentbrabch is very frugal
[0:41:30] <CzeekyTV> @demiiluna thanks i hate it
[0:41:38] <+JGardner03> Imagine one of these Chigoe getting under your skin
[0:41:40] <SpaceCapnCrone> Chigoes were in FFXI, but they were much smaller and couldn't be targeted until they aggroed to you
[0:41:44] <pogo_hobo> wew
[0:41:45] <+alphonseisbest> @demiiluna HAWT
[0:41:46] <%Treasure_Vault> I think game looks lame. Everyone here likes game. We're both right.
[0:41:51] <+Grayhammatter> standing in? oh my
[0:41:53] <%Agami23> i see paige already knows to jump as she runs to look like she is going faster
[0:42:07] <TheFramedWarlock> Treasure Vault be like "Man, the tutorial is really boring this is lame"

[0:47:56] <+tomdwarf> Its totally fine, your not ruining your experience by using that gear
[0:47:56] <$Sphincter_Spelunker> crafted up is usually better, it's not an issue during early game
[0:47:56] <%NeonLight> FFXIV is not the dark souls of MMOs
[0:47:57] <rekinom> nah the gear is just a nice bonus and you'll replace it soon anyway
[0:47:57] <LlamaByDay> If gear is important, it won't be tradeable
[0:47:58] <+healnavi> hit the sparkle man button
[0:47:58] <%Calek> I'm extremely appalled Paige is being carried by the level 8 armour
[0:48:00] <+Lordgale119> you'll replace it in hours and keep it for cosmetic purposes
[0:48:00] <+HollowBeansVG> just use recomended gear peach
[0:48:00] <%JenovasPuppet> You'll replace that shit in like an HOUR
[0:48:01] <Tracazoid> No, you'll be out leveling that gear in no time anyway
[0:48:04] <+UltraViolet371> put on the bigger number always
[0:48:04] <%Chichen> recommended gear button at the top left
[0:48:04] <%Garthunox> gear doesnt make you better, you still need to be good at the game
[0:48:05] <+Quaraezha> You forgot the head
[0:48:07] <+chiazam> this gear will be obsolete in like half an hour
[0:48:08] <%Reaped_Psyche> You'll replace this stuff in like... an hour at most anyway.
[0:48:08] <%Treasure_Vault> i wish all the quest information was given by weirdoes with no lip-sync.

[0:48:18] <%Chichen> @PeachSaliva use the recommended gear button
[0:48:23] <+Quaraezha> Use the Recommended Gear button
[0:48:25] <Rumbutt> when you get to 80 you're gonna get dropped a full set of crafted gear and no one worth listening to would complain about that, this is nothing
[0:48:25] <+alphonseisbest> @Treasure_Vault the best way :P LUL
[0:48:31] <@SoFarFetched> bold of you guys to assume she won't forget about the button later Kappa
[0:48:31] <@Jekado> Gear is scaled scaled anyways and its doesn't need to be bought its just makes things faster
[0:48:31] <feisty_feathers> sipsipHellmo
[0:48:36] <%Estuko> Hope the game's treating you nicely! I'm glad to see you giving it a try ♥ ♥
[0:48:36] <%Chichen> you have more items
[0:48:38] <+healnavi> NotLikeThis
[0:48:44] <zeroeightsix> having gear given to you is part of the FFXIV welcoming process, like how I got a full crafted set when I joined my first fc

[0:49:09] <+SWFanatic> Pasta Rat?
[0:49:15] <@JustinianKnight> if you look at the mini map theres a little arrow
[0:49:19] <+chiazam> never let Paige forget about the Japan train story
[0:49:20] <SpaceCapnCrone> Eyepatches are the HEIGHT of style, it's a fact.
[0:49:20] <%JenovasPuppet> Is Paige going to have to change her name to Peach Zimbardo or will Pat have to change it to Patron Saliva?
[0:49:21] <@JustinianKnight> you can just follow that
[0:49:23] <MarylandJutsu> Elmo said NO....ME NOW
[0:49:24] <$Sphincter_Spelunker> getting lost on the Japanese trains
[0:49:25] <@JustinianKnight> the one in the corner

[0:50:34] <%Agami23> au ra get sexy horns and hats so they win
[0:50:40] <MarylandJutsu> dog is DIRTYYY
[0:50:42] <%DianaTheAscian> I wonder if turning off the map names would help
[0:50:43] <%Estuko> @Rachet20 The one thing I want for this game is for the ability to carry Lalafells as a mount.
[0:50:47] <Xenokun> You can use the Mini-Map in the upper-right, the Orange arrow on there indicates the direction of your quest
[0:50:53] <Blank9> map buton is square on controller
[0:50:58] <+chiazam> down the river paaige
[0:51:00] <%Rachet20> @Estuko SQUARE PLS
[0:51:04] <+furiousfurioso> I play with controller but just reach for the mouse when I want to move the map around and stuff, easier in my mind
[0:51:14] <@CreepyPorpoise> Your mini map up in the top right

[0:51:34] <+Bailey__gaming> Party Cave
[0:51:34] <%Estuko> @Rachet20 in Mabinogi when human players are allied with Giants they can use giant players as mounts and sit on the giant's shoulders as they run around. I love it

[0:52:01] <OneThousandTomatoes> you can zoom in on the map
[0:52:01] <SpaceCapnCrone> I heard a Nox
[0:52:07] <theshillman> WHY IS THERE A GUNDAMN THERE
[0:52:16] <+bytex678> we need to do this the paige way not the human way
[0:52:16] <@JustinianKnight> must have been the wind
[0:52:26] <+Pukenasty> would it help if she increased the size of the mini map so she can see it easier?
[0:52:35] <+Bailey__gaming> @peachsaliva compares to the party cave this is nothing lol
[0:52:40] <AdmiralButtloaf> zoom mini map out as well
[0:52:40] <+furiousfurioso> maybe it would help if she zooms the small map out a bit?
[0:52:41] <+Lordgale119> @theshillman FF is very gundam-friendly
[0:52:41] <%Garthunox> Dark souls had no arrows
[0:52:43] <%Estuko> Plus this is her first MMO isn't it? a lot of these things are super confusing I'm sure.
[0:52:44] <+healnavi> But there...is an arrow?
[0:52:48] <+Lordgale119> there's LITERALLY a gundam in this game
[0:52:50] <$Sphincter_Spelunker> circles are search quests
[0:52:57] <%Estuko> @theshillman it's unbelievably gundam friendly in FF14
[0:52:58] <@SoFarFetched> her biggest enemy: maps
[0:53:00] <pogo_hobo> main map is blank rofl
[0:53:03] <%CptCreampuff16> pat is there a way to disable the ingame chat?

[0:53:22] <$Sphincter_Spelunker> both
[0:53:24] <%JenovasPuppet> We need to go back to the detailed maps of the Souls games
[0:53:25] <Minorou> it's an MMO, they're always overwhelming at first
[0:53:26] <afronooch> nah the map is a whole hassle
[0:53:29] <%Treasure_Vault> Please keep complaining, I love it
[0:53:30] <MarylandJutsu> Paige you love FF4 which doesnt have ARROWS pointing you where to go
[0:53:30] <rizintaco> We got lots of featureless flatland
[0:53:32] <%DianaTheAscian> maybe its both
[0:53:32] <Madovir> press X until map good
[0:53:34] <rizintaco> And dirt
[0:53:35] <+bytex678> mouse and keyboard is so much easier to play with
[0:53:36] <$hrbeck_> it is the concept of map that is wrong
[0:53:37] <+tomdwarf> I have a sister who is map challenged. This is nothing new.
[0:53:38] <+alphonseisbest> DON'T WORRRY U'LL GET TO USED TO IT
[0:53:40] <+qanonisadeathcult> you don't where anything is or how to get there on the map in relation to where you are

[0:55:17] <%CopperTucker> whoever suggested the Elmowalker logo... I have made it
[0:55:18] <$JoshManVGH> Futz with the UI.
[0:55:20] <+bytex678> just play with the mouse and keyboard it's super much easier
[0:55:21] <+alphonseisbest> ur all good Pagie
[0:55:22] <@PlagueOfGripes> Paige, you know you don't prepare. That would be wrong
[0:55:30] <+alphonseisbest> Ur'll learn as u go
[0:55:33] <notaplushtoy> is she using a ps4 controller to play?
[0:55:35] <@Jekado> I've spent well over an hour just changing my UI to where i want it and i still don't like it setup the way it is
[0:55:35] <Blank9> controller's best
[0:55:37] <%MooseIsGoose> No do it all live
[0:55:40] <+alphonseisbest> @notaplushtoy yea
[0:55:41] <+SWFanatic> whats the opposite of crazy talk?
[0:55:45] <+Bailey__gaming> you can do it peach STAY DETERMINED
[0:55:47] <+alphonseisbest> Controller GANG
[0:55:56] <dan_g_v> doing it live is always the best
[0:56:02] <VentWilsn> "normal mute"?
[0:56:03] <%AncelDeLambert> we be mean you
[0:56:03] <%JustToWatch> honestly we come here for the troubleshooting and general incompetence
[0:56:22] <VentWilsn> "normal silence"
[0:56:23] <notaplushtoy> @notaplushtoy ty ty controler isn'nt bad but i haven't lvled up ninja fully so we shall see if that holds up lol
[0:56:26] <pogo_hobo> we need a bard to follow her to play the Jeopardy music for these moments
[0:56:32] <buddhistmetal> I've literally spent the weekend perfecting my ui and inventory, granted I have 5 retainers but I feel the desire to tweak everything
[0:56:33] <Latija> the ui is 100% customizable
[0:56:34] <%JenovasPuppet> It's VERY customizable.
[0:56:40] <shinji_ifrit> I... didn't know this, and I've been playing since 5.1
[0:56:40] <+UltraViolet371> every menu element in the game can be changed to how you want it
[0:56:43] <+alphonseisbest> HEH
[0:56:44] <$Sphincter_Spelunker> lol that's what she said
[0:56:48] <%SenorCounter> Bard playing Yakkity Sax
[0:56:56] <MarylandJutsu> it ok paige, you get used to it over time
[0:57:01] <@PlagueOfGripes> I will say, the map being tones of tan with light orange with low opacity as the objective was a poor choice
[0:57:01] <%dankjerri> i found the fetched
[0:57:03] <+Bailey__gaming> Good luck Peach, I'm off to watch the wrestling, I'm excited for a show for the 1st time in years
[0:57:03] <OneThousandTomatoes> x again
[0:57:05] <%sandrews> I'd say the customizability of the HUD is a little overwhelming
[0:57:05] <$Sphincter_Spelunker> opaque
[0:57:10] <+LittleCinders> MMOs are confusing, no worries Paige! it'll become second nature!
[0:57:28] <pogo_hobo> god gridania and shrouds are so comfy
[0:57:35] <Kiso52> woo bun paige
[0:57:35] <+bytex678> mmos is even more confusing with a joypad
[0:57:37] <@CreepyPorpoise> hYbrid yee
[0:57:41] <@PlagueOfGripes> These awkward controller inputs are why I just used mouse and keyboard
[0:57:42] <@CreepyPorpoise> you've got the mouse right there, why not use it
[0:57:43] <Djinnazz> NO.
[0:57:48] <zeroeightsix> Paige, what I do is drag the map full screen and zoom it for the whole area
[0:57:55] <%JustToWatch> ah yes, the abomination
[0:57:58] <$Sphincter_Spelunker> atpCap
[0:57:58] <%Aztec50> I think it's a lot easier to do the menus with mouse
[0:57:58] <@CreepyPorpoise> I use the controller for fighting and running around, but just use the mouse for the finer details
[0:58:01] <pogo_hobo> controller and mouse best combo
[0:58:03] <zeroeightsix> then you can walk around with it on transparency if you're lost
[0:58:03] <$Sphincter_Spelunker> he did say that
[0:58:03] <+alphonseisbest> @PlagueOfGripes welcome to 14, a great game, surrounded by ppoor choices LUL
[0:58:08] <%strugglepunk2> could she just use Mouse and keyboard?
[0:58:10] <Xenokun> Are they in an IKEA right now?
[0:58:12] <shinji_ifrit> he said it last stream too
[0:58:13] <%theallysaur> wait till she finds out she can get mustard in the game
[0:58:16] <Minorou> a good excuse tbh
[0:58:19] <Monkeyweed21> yea you can use your mouse for any menu
[0:58:20] <%TheWinged7> peepee, or Mr Peepee?
[0:58:20] <%nip_nips> pp on the brain?

[0:59:04] <pogo_hobo> @alphonseisbest controller isn't one of the poor choices - its great in this game
[0:59:21] <%theallysaur> @Sphincter_Spelunker LMFAO
[0:59:27] <buddhistmetal> this game being so good on controller is what convinced me to try it out
[0:59:28] <+alphonseisbest> @pogo_hobo oh yea I love playing on controller, i was on about the map colur
[0:59:32] <Kiso52> im amazed that peach managed to get a character created on ultros too
[0:59:37] <Valdorick> regens for more than 3000% her hp.
[0:59:38] <%Chichen> you werent stupid
[0:59:45] <pogo_hobo> @alphonseisbest oh ya
[0:59:48] <+furiousfurioso> it's probably real confusing if this is your first mmo too
[0:59:50] <+bytex678> i can't even fathom playing with a controller, i'd click the wrong buttons all the time
[0:59:50] <erik_the_oni> haventa?
[0:59:54] <+SWFanatic> use your special eyes
[0:59:55] <$Sphincter_Spelunker> she never reads maps

[1:00:02] <+FingaLights> We know about the trains in japan
[1:00:06] <+bytex678> at least there is no map in dark souls

[1:00:16] <$hrbeck_> "you think you have perceived me, paige!?"

[1:00:23] <$hrbeck_> green check
[1:00:25] <jorniev> its a whole new genre
[1:00:27] <+SWFanatic> shes doing it
[1:00:30] <$Sphincter_Spelunker> ohmygod, did she think the train would be like a bus??
[1:00:38] <%JenovasPuppet> There are like 5 billion things to learn in this game. It's totally cool that you don't learn them all instantly.
[1:00:42] <Monkeyweed21> @PeachSaliva you have a sprint button on LT and Y btw
[1:00:45] <%Keyd00d> no worries
[1:00:46] <+furiousfurioso> you're fine!
[1:00:48] <Chaos_Aether> no worry
[1:00:49] <+chiazam> when do we teach her how to Sprint
[1:00:49] <%Chichen> YOURE DOING FINE
[1:00:49] <+SWFanatic> you doin good
[1:00:50] <%Aztec50> Learning!
[1:00:51] <%SenorCounter> No this is your first day
[1:00:52] <$hrbeck_> we're here for it, embarassment and all
[1:00:54] <%walternatorz> first 24 hours
[1:00:55] <SpaceCapnCrone> It's your second first day
[1:00:58] <+WeLucklessJacks> You're fine.
[1:00:59] <MarylandJutsu> Paige you're doing great
[1:01:00] <@Jekado> NO i had ALOT of troubles navigating and the UI for a while.
[1:01:00] <%sandrews> eh growing pains?
[1:01:00] <Kiso52> this is fine
[1:01:01] <shinji_ifrit> it's not annoying lol
[1:01:03] <+bytex678> we grow stronger with your embarassment
[1:01:03] <Melchior_the_Wise> you're doing fine
[1:01:05] <OneThousandTomatoes> it's fine
[1:01:06] <+tomdwarf> Its totally cool. I come here expecting some hang-ups/difficulty.
[1:01:06] <Lunarclock> no this is funny
[1:01:07] <+FingaLights> We are here for this. It's still enjoyable because its with you
[1:01:08] <%SenorCounter> Your first 24 hours of overall play is considered your first day.
[1:01:09] <pogo_hobo> its funny lol
[1:01:09] <supergoblinpunch> Nothing to be embarrassed about the UI is min
[1:01:10] <$JoshManVGH> Also, controller is really great when you learn it, but it can be a little obtuse for first time navigation
[1:01:12] <+alphonseisbest> yup
[1:01:14] <vVAstrAVv> its not annoying paige. 14s map is notoriously hard to get to grips with
[1:01:14] <Kiso52> its not like pat cant help her at all XD
[1:01:15] <%Kenzo2000> It's a lot, we know
[1:01:16] <dan_g_v> no bully the bunfox
[1:01:18] <%Estuko> I would've been shocked if anyone jumped into FF14 and knew everything from the get-go. You'rre doing great! <3
[1:01:19] <+tomdwarf> Its a lot of info, menus, and control options
[1:01:24] <+alphonseisbest> ur doing good! <3
[1:01:24] <Coystick> I'll never get the appeal, MMOs are just bad RPGs with many people
[1:01:25] <+3d_pbandj> don't worry, soon there will be even more stuff on the screen
[1:01:31] <$Sphincter_Spelunker> you can toggle most it off
[1:01:32] <Melchior_the_Wise> GRIDANIA
[1:01:35] <%Reaped_Psyche> There are so many fucking menuse and windows in this game it took me a long while to make use of half of them.
[1:01:36] <entertainmentglutton> I hope you enjoy the game. need to be in the right frame of mind to understand everything
[1:01:36] <OneThousandTomatoes> yeah you just ignore it after a while

[1:01:50] <MarylandJutsu> Assist paige plz mr. npc

[1:02:06] <%Estuko> @Coystick Everyone has their game play preferences, some people like to play with people others don't
[1:02:20] <+bytex678> aeris doesn't die in this game sorry
[1:02:23] <+BIumen> @Coystick the key is this one is also a good mmo

[1:04:30] <$Sphincter_Spelunker> atpDance coxJam atpDance
[1:04:31] <+mariomarc> I think Paige might need a big cheat sheet to remember everything during the game
[1:04:32] <OneThousandTomatoes> refresh
[1:04:36] <%cobalt_phoenix_> @shinji_ifrit might need to refresh stream
[1:04:38] <Kiso52> omg smol pat
[1:04:42] <OneThousandTomatoes> twitch messes up sound sometimes
[1:04:59] <theanora1> Poor Geif isn't in the animation
[1:05:02] <%rumtumtugnutz> I don't think Paige is gonna have a good time with bosses
[1:05:03] <%Chichen> @shinji_ifrit reset stream or disable "Low Latency mode" in the cogwheel
[1:05:03] <shinji_ifrit> didn't help :(
[1:05:04] <%dankjerri> oh god
[1:05:08] <%dankjerri> oh god no
[1:05:21] <+evilpaul13> she needs to water Pat so he gets bigger
[1:05:21] <%dankjerri> you cant have this many phoenixes in a room
[1:05:22] <%Chichen> @shinji_ifrit Low latency mode, disable it.
[1:05:36] <shinji_ifrit> oh god, thanks @Chichen
[1:05:42] <Kiso52> @evilpaul13 LOL
[1:05:43] <+HollowBeansVG> yes we can
[1:06:06] <%Estuko> @evilpaul13 Buy T-Shirts, Every t-shirt you buy makes Pat grow in size and anger
[1:06:11] <$Sphincter_Spelunker> the sound distortion is twitch trying to catch you up from lag. I'd rather be behind
[1:06:33] <%dankjerri> @estuko deep cut
[1:06:38] <+filibertlilibert> Heck yeah I am ALL for Paige getting in on this
[1:07:19] <meggogan> My son be jammin to this music lol
[1:07:33] <Broand> Peach doko
[1:07:38] <%Estuko> @dankjerri I'm sorry
[1:08:26] <%dankjerri> oh no not like 'aw that sucks' more like 'now that i aint heard in a long time'
[1:08:41] <+SWFanatic> buying shirts makes orb go up?
[1:08:46] <%dankjerri> that wasnt even on the channel, right, that was the machinma days
[1:09:00] <%TheWinged7> i only just noticed the height comparison line between pat and the large drink LUL
[1:09:53] <$Sphincter_Spelunker> @dankjerri it was at the end of early tbf videos too

[1:10:53] <%Chichen> Disable low latency or refresh
[1:10:53] <+CalderGaming> triple triad lord spotted
[1:10:53] <Valdorick> psa1guy
[1:10:59] <+FingaLights> @SveriSageAdvice was, go to the settings, then advance, then turn off latency mode
[1:11:08] <Rumbutt> if you're watching and the music is fucky pause and then play the stream, sometimes works better than refresh
[1:11:11] <%Garthunox> vewwy fucky wucky
[1:11:12] <%Estuko> Hanging out in stream while messing aroud in Lego Studio is nice

[1:16:18] <shinji_ifrit> hello there gloved man
[1:16:22] <clempstwitch> @SveriSageAdvice Just fine thanks, having trouble sleeping so I'm checking out Paige's adventure :)
[1:16:31] <vVAstrAVv> pat thats a huge exaggeration
[1:16:33] <%Dakuu75> at least it's not FFXI... everything would chase you to the ends of the earth back then lol
[1:16:33] <+RoByte2> This isn't Eureka Pat, the leash range is pretty short
[1:16:34] <+Grayhammatter> remember to do combo peach
[1:16:34] <Psyramics> she forgot about comboes
[1:16:35] <JAGwab> why there isnt a goblin at this vtuber´s shoulder?
[1:16:48] <%WebmanJax> Remember Peach, your combo is 1. 2. 1. 2. 1. 2.
[1:16:48] <%RealThiele> much vorpal
[1:16:49] <olaksi> someone should probably tell her you need to use thrust every time
[1:17:04] <+alphonseisbest> @RoByte2 i don't think Pat has ever stepped foot in Euereka?
[1:17:09] <%Chichen> Paige, map
[1:17:10] <%DianaTheAscian> combos have left the brain
[1:17:13] <LilacsandFreedom> It'd be in the orange area
[1:17:13] <+Frampton1337> Remember Do Combo!
[1:17:15] <%juxtest> Shes a dragoon, she can either do her DPS combo or she can avoid the AoEs but she cant do both,
[1:17:21] <+ClericOfSparda> I never did. Pat wouldn't unless necessary
[1:17:22] <%SveriSageAdvice> @SveriSageAdvice oof, hope you can get some rest sometime soon dude
[1:17:23] <%Garthunox> brain is sive

[1:17:56] <%RealThiele> coxWiggle
[1:18:07] <%miabyte> hi @clempstwitch hun

[1:18:19] <%Keyd00d> remember true thrust then vorpal
[1:18:22] <@JustinianKnight> yea true
[1:18:28] <+Frampton1337> she did it once!
[1:18:29] <@JustinianKnight> sometimes its just the middle
[1:18:33] <clempstwitch> @miabyte HEY MIA!
[1:18:38] <+Grayhammatter> oh boy
[1:18:46] <%MooseIsGoose> Do not worry about the fate
[1:18:49] <@JustinianKnight> you can do the fate
[1:18:49] <%DianaTheAscian> ignore that
[1:18:51] <LoneFonte> SourPls
[1:18:52] <%juxtest> Alpha Male vs Alfemale
[1:19:03] <haisho> upstairs?
[1:19:04] <dr_sweets> Isn't Alfemale one of the elf twins
[1:19:05] <rizintaco> I'm still waiting for Mu Male to catch on.
[1:19:11] <$Sphincter_Spelunker> ignore Fate, just like the series
[1:19:13] <%Reaped_Psyche> I love that she's got this big hype crew following her around.
[1:19:25] <%MooseIsGoose> people killed it
[1:19:26] <%Chichen> yah just ignore em
[1:19:28] <pogo_hobo> you did it!
[1:19:30] <%Keyd00d> it always says joined fate when you're in the area but you don't have to do it
[1:19:30] <Valdorick> FATE/ Stay away
[1:19:38] <$Sphincter_Spelunker> @Valdorick LOL
[1:19:48] <SpaceCapnCrone> you can do 'em if you want
[1:19:51] <+shadowxdemon0> that was a good one
[1:19:58] <%DianaTheAscian> Fate don't really matter rn
[1:20:02] <squaggleboom> FATEs are only good for grinding other Jobs when you cap out your first one
[1:20:07] <$Sphincter_Spelunker> and a sprint
[1:20:14] <%HollowBeansVG> recommended gear!!! lol
[1:20:21] <%RealThiele> +2 sipsipGasm
[1:20:26] <+Quaraezha> +3
[1:20:27] <2017y> recommended gea
[1:20:36] <%clempstwitch> How're you enjoying your XIV adventure so far?
[1:20:38] <2017y> porin
[1:20:40] <@JustinianKnight> FATEs can just be fun mini lore too so just do em if ya feel like it
[1:20:42] <+livlinn> the what
[1:20:44] <@CreepyPorpoise> E G G
[1:20:45] <%Reaped_Psyche> I've noticed that the Recommended gear button stopped working for me after a certain point.
[1:20:45] <%Garthunox> Paige would you like to know a macro so you can set sprint to the right analog stick?
[1:20:51] <vVAstrAVv> soob cumzone
[1:20:54] <Kiso52> is pat in an alt?
[1:20:55] <pogo_hobo> soup
[1:20:55] <+FingaLights> Cum zone??
[1:20:56] <+Mekhet09> What's with the obnoxious endwalker logo? Is it to block chat?
[1:21:01] <@JustinianKnight> yes
[1:21:06] <SpaceCapnCrone> this group would probably just roll over any fates she does anyways
[1:21:07] <+FingaLights> @Mekhet09 ye
[1:21:19] <%Keyd00d> Jebaited thick
[1:21:22] <$Sphincter_Spelunker> again, why not just turn off the game chat? she's not doing group stuff
[1:21:23] <+Riceamike> Paige should just block chat with her avatar's huge knockers
[1:21:28] <+FingaLights> Jedi Thicc
[1:21:29] <%RealThiele> thicc
[1:21:32] <rizintaco> Jedite, the best Sailor Moon villian
[1:21:35] <%other_badger> when the jadeite is thicc 😳
[1:21:38] <+Mekhet09> @Sphincter_Spelunker Yeah that would be a better idea for now.
[1:21:39] <+VitoXXI> is that a rathalos?
[1:21:42] <+FoolsArcade> RATHALOS
[1:21:46] <%clempstwitch> This entire zone is super pretty. Favourite music in vanilla ARR
[1:21:56] <AdmiralButtloaf> EGG
[1:21:57] <+FunkyStreams> anal egg?
[1:21:59] <olaksi> it's really easy to accidentally unhide the ingame chat, it's not a big deal
[1:22:01] <%Bane_Kaikyo> Why doesn't Pat use a 2-person mount and chauferr Peach around?
[1:22:02] <Kiso52> @VitoXXI yeah you get him as a mount for the collab with mhw
[1:22:03] <%RealThiele> cannoli egg
[1:22:06] <+logoth_> Canoli
[1:22:16] <WordsHere> Money tomatoSmile
[1:22:18] <rekinom> @PatStaresAt Did you give paige a referral link so you get the gold chocob feathers ?
[1:22:20] <Kiso52> @Bane_Kaikyo i thikn hes on an alt to do the story with her
[1:22:27] <%Dakuu75> stun
[1:22:32] <+Aullama> Sweep the legs! stripGo
[1:22:33] <$skizzuto> It stuns enemies
[1:22:34] <%Chichen> STONE COLD STUNNER
[1:22:35] <Jaxnos> yeah, the chat doesn't really permanently hide, so this is a fine solution.
[1:22:46] <+evilpaul13> @Aullama beat me to it, why don't you?!?
[1:22:47] <$GarbageNirvana> Use it on mobs when they're casting a thing
[1:22:47] <%SveriSageAdvice> oh my god, there are so many of us here that the crowd shouts are here
[1:22:49] <+CalderGaming> Leg Sweep is a "hey stop that" skill to interrupt special enemy attacks you don't want to deal with
[1:22:49] <+thebeargoesHONK> Hey Paige, what are some of your favorite American movie tropes?  I'm partial to the 5 course breakfast and the character just grabs like half a dozen grapes as they run out the door..
[1:22:52] <@SoFarFetched> @Kiso52 thats not his alt
[1:22:53] <dr_sweets> Leg Sweep defeats Cobra Kai enemies instantly
[1:23:04] <@SoFarFetched> @Bane_Kaikyo probably to get her used to running around the map instead of being taken everywhere
[1:23:09] <olaksi> especially if the player hypothetically has a habit of panicking and pushing random UI buttons
[1:23:10] <Kiso52> @SoFarFetched fair i thought he was.
[1:23:17] <$GarbageNirvana> @thebeargoesHONK I have literally never seen that in my life
[1:23:38] <$Sphincter_Spelunker> damn, you get an interrupt this early? weird
[1:23:40] <$GarbageNirvana> What movies are you watching
[1:23:47] <%Bane_Kaikyo> @SoFarFetched that kinda makes sense... force her to gain some sense of direction... mmkay
[1:23:51] <%juxtest> The Jadeite Thicc, named in honor of Nophica, guardian deity of Gridania
[1:23:58] <%RealThiele> Galfrid and the Quivermen
[1:23:59] <Kiso52> but thanks farfetched for the clarification
[1:24:15] <+logoth_> Is that Maximillian dood
[1:24:18] <dr_sweets> Time for Dark Souls
[1:24:26] <rizintaco> Not Pictured: Any support
[1:24:30] <2017y> man the gridania story isnt exactly thrilling
[1:24:44] <+thebeargoesHONK> @2017y just give it 40 hours
[1:24:49] <$GarbageNirvana> I'm a sucker for a good pre-kill one-liner myself
[1:24:50] <@JustinianKnight> its the other way
[1:24:59] <%nip_nips> why she going that way?
[1:25:04] <maybefalco> blue is fate
[1:25:05] <$skizzuto> the blue is a fate
[1:25:06] <%MooseIsGoose> That is a fate thing
[1:25:06] <%nip_nips> blue is fate
[1:25:06] <%JenovasPuppet> Blue is a FATE
[1:25:06] <+bluedude153> Thats a fatre
[1:25:07] <@JustinianKnight> The blue is a FATE
[1:25:09] <LoneFonte> blue is something else
[1:25:10] <%RealThiele> Hasta la vista, baby
[1:25:11] <%juxtest> The blue circle is a FATE
[1:25:13] <%Chichen> NOT the blue
[1:25:13] <@SoFarFetched> check your main quest
[1:25:16] <%clempstwitch> ARR's story is certainly a story, isn't it? Boy Heavensward is great.
[1:25:17] <%SveriSageAdvice> you can click on the quest
[1:25:18] <+evilpaul13> blue circle is a FATE for exp
[1:25:18] <Jaxnos> @GarbageNirvana i know the one they mean. it's usually the dad at the start of the film that was a big business man and had no time to sit for breakfast, so he grabs some food and ignores the wife and kid. he learns to appreciate family by the end of the film and sits to family dinner.
[1:25:20] <+Kise77> blue is FATEs, big firey icon is your MSQ
[1:25:20] <%nip_nips> look on the top right map, it has an arrow
[1:25:21] <@JustinianKnight> look at the circle minimap
[1:25:23] <OneThousandTomatoes> orange better than blue
[1:25:24] <%DianaTheAscian> @PeachSaliva Blue is fate orange is quest
[1:25:26] <Aeonknight_87> @2017y they're trying to ease you in.  if they throw a shit load of story at you from the get go w/o any world building it gets overwhelming, on top of learning how2play
[1:25:26] <shiny_prinny> the blue circle is a FATE
[1:25:29] <@thenefftw> @PeachSaliva Blue is Fate
[1:25:30] <%JenovasPuppet> It's so simple! Don't go for the obvious thing, go for the other obvious thing! No not that thing!
[1:25:31] <$Sphincter_Spelunker> @PeachSaliva turn on your Sprint LT+Y atpCap
[1:25:32] <%Chichen> hit the map button
[1:25:36] <%Chichen> homes in on it
[1:25:37] <olaksi> blue is fate, orange is bad, yellow is quest, keep up!
[1:25:38] <MarylandJutsu> Thoughts on the Producers movie and why its so amazing?
[1:25:39] <OneThousandTomatoes> yeah
[1:25:39] <@JustinianKnight> also yea don't worry about it
[1:25:39] <Jaxnos> it's a very 90s trope at this point
[1:25:39] <%SveriSageAdvice> map button at the bottom
[1:25:40] <+Kise77> if you click on the text it pops it up on the map
[1:25:53] <Manooz> i'd jjust use kbm...
[1:25:56] <+evilpaul13> mouse wheel zooms out
[1:25:58] <%Keyd00d> use sprint
[1:25:59] <zeroeightsix> use a PS4 controller for the touchpad!
[1:26:08] <%Keyd00d> LB+Y

[1:26:31] <AdmiralButtloaf> black square
[1:26:33] <+evilpaul13> gray running icon
[1:26:37] <$Sphincter_Spelunker> FINALLY
[1:26:40] <+Mekhet09> It doesn't last long.
[1:26:41] <+maxteammagus> @kingkrampus ,as
[1:26:42] <%JenovasPuppet> Now you are SPEED
[1:26:44] <%Keyd00d> gotta go slow on these early parts
[1:26:47] <$Sphincter_Spelunker> THAT WAS THERE THE ENTIRE 1ST STREAM

[1:27:04] <MarylandJutsu> Abiilty
[1:27:05] <%Keyd00d> yeah it has to cooldown
[1:27:06] <2017y> turn around and elusive jump backwards; forwards
[1:27:07] <+evilpaul13> 60 second cool down
[1:27:10] <+Mekhet09> It sucks.
[1:27:12] <+CalderGaming> eventually you will get Mount
[1:27:13] <$skizzuto> yeah it lasts for 20 seconds and then you have to wait another 40 before you can use it again
[1:27:14] <Jaxnos> look at miss forever stamina over here
[1:27:14] <crimsonharvest> you can use it in fights if you really need to nope out
[1:27:14] <%JenovasPuppet> Some day you will unlock mounts
[1:27:16] <+Mekhet09> Should be indefinite outside of combat.
[1:27:16] <%Calek> sprint should be the default speed
[1:27:16] <%Garthunox> it used to use TP lol
[1:27:21] <%sandrews> hey at least it doesn't cause a resource
[1:27:25] <MarylandJutsu> no no paige this is what WE SUBSCRIBED for
[1:27:26] <tanarath> Jerry, this is 110% on-brand
[1:27:30] <+evilpaul13> go to Jeuno at level 18 to unlock Chocobo Riding
[1:27:32] <$Sphincter_Spelunker> TOR lets you sprint all day. 0/10

[1:27:38] <@SoFarFetched> Im trying to be thait fairy lure for her LUL
[1:27:40] <@SoFarFetched> that*
[1:27:43] <%DianaTheAscian> Pat should just set up that sprint on R3 or L3 for her
[1:27:45] <Ultralazuli> this music reminds me of the Fable series of games
[1:27:48] <@SSaryn> @Jekado Trust me, we've been trying to get this done for years.
[1:27:52] <%Chichen> its not indefinite
[1:27:53] <OneThousandTomatoes> its not

[1:27:54] <%clempstwitch> You're doing FINE, Paigey. It took me forever to get used to this games mechanics!
[1:27:55] <+Mekhet09> Lol I said i wish it was
[1:27:56] <Jaxnos> it's not, they're saying it should be
[1:27:57] <%MooseIsGoose> I though the auto run sucked because I kept hitting it but now I am used to it
[1:28:00] <Manooz> he said it SHOULD be
[1:28:01] <%Chichen> ITS NOT indefinite, just longer @PeachSaliva
[1:28:05] <%nip_nips> HONK

[1:50:40] <@JustinianKnight> its not very complicated
[1:50:41] <@SoFarFetched> its fine to play FF14 solo
[1:50:44] <Lithdoran> I can't wait until peach gets into end-game fashionbringers/fashionwalker
[1:50:47] <+SammyOVision> BED UNLOCKED
[1:50:49] <MarylandJutsu> yep you can play solos for sure
[1:50:52] <dr_sweets> @dabeaminator It's remarkable easy to play alone, at least until endgame
[1:50:53] <Lithdoran> Do you think Peach will play Reaper?
[1:50:59] <@SSaryn> It's definitely not gonna be completely solo but yeah, you can play easily solo.
[1:51:00] <+FunkyStreams> sleep.exe
[1:51:02] <%juxtest> Oh yeah Guildleves

[1:51:23] <+tomdwarf> They arent worth the time.
[1:51:25] <%JenovasPuppet> Pretty fucking pointless unless you're chivo farming.
[1:51:26] <theanora1> they're fine for crafting
[1:51:28] <%Wallabri> more like Guild Leave-those-alone
[1:51:29] <+Ynkubus_> not battle ones anyway
[1:51:30] <MarylandJutsu> Levemets however
[1:51:31] <%walternatorz> crafting guildleves are great
[1:51:31] <+chiazam> THESE JUST GO AWAY
[1:51:34] <+DeRedBaron> i missed this part and i didn't start doing them UNTIL i levelded up lancer... a week ago
[1:51:34] <+abrupt_abe> @creepyporpoise Of the coffee variety?

[1:51:50] <MarylandJutsu> yeah crafters/gatherers
[1:51:51] <vVAstrAVv> guild leves are only good for crafters/gatherers
[1:51:51] <%Garthunox> they're used for making money as a crafter pat
[1:51:55] <orbulon> I used leves to level up to 41 when i could do stone vigil
[1:51:56] <JanusII> There's a few specific uses for them but most people won't care going through MSQ.
[1:51:58] <Futurecity10> leves are good for 1-50 for gatherer
[1:52:01] <+Grayhammatter> ignore everyone, except for some
[1:52:04] <jorniev> WAIT REALLY!? nobody does subquests?
[1:52:05] <+tomdwarf> Paige sounds so disapointed.

[1:52:43] <%other_badger> @jorniev leves are good for crafters and gatherers but not really for combat classes
[1:52:56] <+tomdwarf> @jorniev Yeah, no. People do subquests that unlock other content (Like dungeons and boss fights), but base quests and randomized quests (leves)? I know nobody who does them.

[1:55:05] <$skizzuto> correct pronounciation LUL
[1:55:06] <%walternatorz> Roegadyn names are lit
[1:55:06] <@SoFarFetched> Ligma Lominsa
[1:55:08] <UvBenServed> LUL LUL LUL
[1:55:09] <%dankjerri> SEA WOLVES NAME
[1:55:10] <+CalderGaming> LIMSMA NUTZ
[1:55:11] <%Ranryu692> is that a Welsh name? LUL
[1:55:12] <OneThousandTomatoes> gaelic
[1:55:12] <LoneFonte> ROE NAMES YEAH
[1:55:12] <%hoodedlefty> the beehive is a classy joint... that happens to have mostly naked dancers
[1:55:13] <Valdorick> Fucking welsh
[1:55:13] <squaggleboom> She's not in Balmung so she won't see the ERP wall of Ul'dah
[1:55:15] <%CappuccinoGuil> Ahhhh yea, Roe names LUL
[1:55:16] <WhereIsWill> ligma lominsa LUL LUL
[1:55:19] <@commanderclaw> They're welsh AF
[1:55:20] <%SveriSageAdvice> there is a Miqote in Limsa Lominsa's bar that literally is just a keyboard smash
[1:55:21] <$shurtal> Unless you're Adjective Noun
[1:55:23] <+Ynkubus_> Wyb is pronounce vib
[1:55:24] <+Goraka91> Actually, it's Roogadine
[1:55:31] <%miabyte> I just assume all Roe's are Welsh
[1:55:31] <%walternatorz> just throw "w's" and "y's" at everything
[1:55:32] <%CappuccinoGuil> The Roes HATE vowels, Vowels killer their MOTHER.
[1:55:34] <@SoFarFetched> happy Wybbn's day
[1:55:37] <Latija> you will never wake up if you sleep
[1:55:37] <%dankjerri> just sea wolves. ul dah roe are almost native american in their naming
[1:55:40] <+AmanisHouseOfNonsense> Roe Names know people who use vowels, and those people are cowards.
[1:55:43] <@SSaryn> Rested EXP be gud
[1:55:44] <dabeaminator> Letter "E" aside, how do people do roleplay in a game where every character is the biggest strongest chosen one in the main plot?
[1:55:44] <Lithdoran> @Ranryu692 Yes. Rae names are either <Descriptor> <Noun> or Welsh.
[1:55:45] <stoic_nod> Sea Wolf Roe names are EASY to pronounce. Just pronounce them like they're spelled, but W's are V's
[1:55:50] <diontmack> hoary boulder the best
[1:55:52] <Lithdoran> Roe*
[1:55:52] <$skizzuto> Next quest is from Miounne
[1:55:55] <%Ranryu692> @Ranryu692 nice
[1:55:57] <+3d_pbandj> @Ynkubus_ It is!!!!???? Oh my gosh I've been confused by that for years
[1:55:58] <%walternatorz> next msq is back there
[1:55:58] <+Lordgale119> They're so god damn welsh
[1:56:01] <Mortal_Wombat_I> Doing /doze allows you to sleep!
[1:56:02] <%juxtest> How will Paige take to The Admiral?
[1:56:12] <%cherrycottontail> they are either welsh or a first time RPer
[1:56:17] <Mortal_Wombat_I> There’s actually 3 separate poses for sleeping
[1:56:20] <%Garthunox> my roe is not welsh fuck off with that
[1:56:30] <+Ynkubus_> @3d_pbandj I was confused at fist but I checked it out when I really wanted to pronounce Merlwybs name
[1:56:34] <%Garthunox> Arhlo is not welsh
[1:56:36] <+Lordgale119> if your roe has a name like that they sure are
[1:56:40] <@SoFarFetched> welshucks
[1:56:51] <theanora1> there are two types of Roe names "Adjective Noun" and "Zangief typing"
[1:56:52] <+Freelance7> Not in the beginning parts
[1:56:54] <@JustinianKnight> not until much later
[1:56:56] <+Grayhammatter> not in this part
[1:56:57] <%zamatermort> So much talking? In a rpg? no way
[1:57:00] <%cherrycottontail> also arr doesn't have much
[1:57:01] <@SoFarFetched> yeah bigger Key moments
[1:57:01] <@CreepyPorpoise> You'll get a lot more voice acting in the expansions, but even then yeah...
[1:57:01] <+Freelance7> There will be more as you get to the expansions
[1:57:07] <+Goraka91> Roe names are so aggressively Welsh i've been invited to 2 separate Welsh guilds by existing
[1:57:08] <+logoth_> ARR is like CTRL ALT DEL. a lot of words
[1:57:09] <RadianceInABottle> VA is going to be more prominent in Heavens Ward
[1:57:11] <eliamo101> the welsh are cute
[1:57:13] <SpaceCapnCrone> You know who has a great name?  Firmalbert.
[1:57:14] <MayShip> i was so happy when more scenes were voiced after ARR
[1:57:23] <squaggleboom> And the voice acting gets better after ARR
[1:57:26] <@JustinianKnight> Firmalbert is the true MVP
[1:57:36] <MayShip> I learned how to say so many names after
[1:57:43] <+RelikaNox> Firmalbert <3
[1:57:49] <+logoth_> "ohh...."
[1:57:55] <Nupinoop296> i love Firmalbert
[1:58:01] <@Jekado> RIDE MY CHOCOBO!
[1:58:03] <%sandrews> chubaco?
[1:58:05] <+Grayhammatter> choboco
[1:58:08] <squaggleboom> I had no idea how to say Alohinaud until voice acting
[1:58:20] <Lithdoran> Also, whoever said 'wyb' is pronounced 'vib' is wrong. In Welsh, 'w' is a long u sound.
[1:58:26] <+Lordgale119> time to obtain B U R D
[1:58:28] <Srthunda> is chobaco chocobo themed tabaco?
[1:58:41] <stoic_nod> @Lithdoran In FFXIV wyb is vib.
[1:58:42] <Djinnazz> @Srthunda flavored.
[1:58:42] <%sandrews> how do you make a long U sound?
[1:58:53] <+democrazyyy> you can do it paige
[1:58:56] <stoic_nod> Merlvib Bloofissvin
[1:58:57] <+Gudren> long u you say he vowels name
[1:59:02] <jorniev> i still remember that one video of a guy asking random people on the street what a chocobo was... and one dude getting REALLY angry about being asked.
[1:59:02] <+Lordgale119> @sandrews "oo" vs "uh"

[2:06:10] <+logoth_> Why is there a gorilla there
[2:06:14] <%Chichen> HOUSING.
[2:06:15] <$Sphincter_Spelunker> oh my god, that mount
[2:06:16] <rekinom> @GarbageNirvana Pride and accomplishment of having all the achievements
[2:06:16] <LordDudeTheFirst> Housing (Savage)
[2:06:17] <Srthunda> is it really living if you aint fishing?
[2:06:20] <MarylandJutsu> @logoth_ its a mount
[2:06:20] <%Garthunox> ITS FUCKING NOT
[2:06:23] <+aslfrasle> The fishing achievements are a bit much, but I've almost caught all the fish in the game.
[2:06:25] <+SammyOVision> GOOD LUCK BUYING LAND
[2:06:27] <olaksi> @MayShip this is why i did BLU quests lol
[2:06:28] <CrimsonFox777> HOME OWNERSHIP PogChamp
[2:06:28] <$shurtal> it's (TOTALLY NOT) Free Real Estate
[2:06:29] <$hrbeck_> rip
[2:06:29] <Futurecity10> I got a small house 3 months into starting FF14
[2:06:30] <tanarath> Pat, fuck you, it's fine
[2:06:40] <+aslfrasle> Only missing like half of the Shadowbringers Big Fish.
[2:06:40] <Futurecity10> shit was tight
[2:06:47] <MarylandJutsu> its opposite of free rel estte
[2:06:48] <LordDudeTheFirst> Actually Housing (Ultimate)
[2:06:49] <@JustinianKnight> I live there
[2:06:52] <+bluedude153> TIME TO GO TO THE ERP CLUBS
[2:06:53] <$Sphincter_Spelunker> just have this slave gorilla
[2:06:54] <+Mekhet09> Fuck gardening. I can't believe it's blocked by housing.
[2:06:57] <%Dapper_Cactuar> housing is the true endgame PVP
[2:07:01] <%JenovasPuppet> Pat needs to camp out for days to get Paige a house.
[2:07:02] <CrimsonFox777> Wait, wasn't the housing market in FF14 legitimately fucked for a while or am I thinking of some other MMO?
[2:07:02] <$GarbageNirvana> I wonder if there's players in the game rich enough to just have their own house without a FC or anything
[2:07:09] <OneThousandTomatoes> there are
[2:07:10] <Azathotic> Yoshi-P Add Instanced Housing Challenge
[2:07:13] <olaksi> @GarbageNirvana easily
[2:07:18] <+RelikaNox> I just recently lost my in-game house due to auto-demo cause I was working on an alt and missed the email warning sofieFine
[2:07:18] <+Lordgale119> Paige needs a strong party for the house buying raid, LF healers for her carpal tunnel
[2:07:21] <watts121> Paige went as tall as possible on her Viera right?
[2:07:24] <%fetrigon> drink TPFufun
[2:07:25] <%JenovasPuppet> @GarbageNirvana So many characters. It's just a matter of being able to find an open plot.
[2:07:25] <%walternatorz> has Paige gotten her new prescription yet?
[2:07:27] <+bluedude153> @CrimsonFox777 You cannot buy a house in ff14 at this point. Forget it exists, and stay sane
[2:07:28] <OneThousandTomatoes> really looking forward to the island
[2:07:35] <$GarbageNirvana> dang
[2:07:38] <%juxtest> I spent all my gil on shiny silver dye for a glam, and it was a better investment than a house
[2:07:41] <Neryl_> @RelikaNox riPepperonis
[2:07:46] <%Garthunox> psaBlind
[2:07:51] <hamster_eater> @CrimsonFox777 is there an mmo where housing -isnt- totally busted
[2:07:53] <@JustinianKnight> we have a big ol Fc house anyways
[2:07:54] <%fetrigon> sipsipSipsipblind
[2:08:04] <olaksi> @CrimsonFox777 art imitates life
[2:08:10] <+FunkyStreams> what's up with all the southern contractions?
[2:08:13] <%Dakuu75> there are cs where ppl call you by your last name right? I jsut wanna see an NPC call her "Mrs. Saliva"lol
[2:08:16] <OneThousandTomatoes> hopefully it'll stop gradening from being locked behind housing
[2:08:16] <Lithdoran> @CrimsonFox777 An mmo that doesn't have housing
[2:08:17] <%Dakuu75> npc*
[2:08:21] <+bluedude153> Let the people who run fancy night clubs have all the houses. They do gods work
[2:08:22] <@JustinianKnight> just take the cash at this point
[2:08:23] <+FingaLights> @olaksi LUL was just about to type that
[2:08:23] <$Sphincter_Spelunker> @FunkyStreams cuz she's southern
[2:08:24] <@Jekado> trust me you will stop reading some of them
[2:08:32] <+Shoosler> click in the right joystick to make the window bigger
[2:08:34] <$hrbeck_> yeah, no one cares about the words- just be paige
[2:08:36] <OneThousandTomatoes> when in doubt, take the money
[2:08:36] <$GarbageNirvana> @Dakuu75 When she joins a GC they'll call her by her rank & last name
[2:08:39] <+bluedude153> I went into a house that made itself look like it was the alleyway behind a dennys
[2:08:43] <OneThousandTomatoes> thats how mafia work
[2:08:44] <watts121> Qeeqya
[2:08:44] <%pokefan9956> !uptime
[2:08:45] <@JustinianKnight> Ki-Kern
[2:08:45] <@SoFarFetched> QUEQUEEG?
[2:08:48] <$Sphincter_Spelunker> sounds like a slur
[2:08:49] <Lithdoran> people read ARR quests??????
[2:08:51] <OneThousandTomatoes> I have no fucking idea
[2:08:52] <Monkeyweed21> quebeecer
[2:08:53] <+FunkyStreams> @Sphincter_Spelunker Oh, right. Glad she got out.
[2:08:55] <%Dakuu75> @GarbageNirvana lol, nice
[2:08:56] <Daxalog> Level Ups arent real unless you get a new skill
[2:09:02] <+FingaLights> All of it
[2:09:06] <+FunkyStreams> not all of us do.
[2:09:20] <%pokefan9956> why ain't uptime workin
[2:09:22] <%rumtumtugnutz> FFXIV is always fantasy british
[2:09:30] <%Garthunox> aint no americans in this game
[2:09:32] <$GarbageNirvana> Except when it's not
[2:09:37] <+SWFanatic> Can ratmen swim?
[2:09:42] <+CalderGaming> rats. they're the rats. qiqirn are the rats. they sneak at night they stalk at night, they're the rats.
[2:09:43] <@mike0dude> shadowbringer is like fantasy welsh
[2:09:46] <Futurecity10> jeez, and I cannot stress this enough, louise
[2:09:47] <%Dakuu75> there must be tons of ppl that wish they could make a Qiqirin character
[2:09:50] <$Sphincter_Spelunker> ratmen are part men, that part can swim
[2:09:51] <%Garthunox> the clempsmen
[2:09:51] <afronooch> @pokefan9956 2 hours 10 min
[2:09:51] <@JustinianKnight> theyre a kinda rat race from FFXI
[2:09:53] <Lithdoran> @Sphincter_Spelunker "Quequeg" "Kweekweg" however you wanna spell it IS a slur.
[2:09:57] <+SWFanatic> aha
[2:09:57] <%pokefan9956> thanks
[2:10:01] <%WebmanJax> You are not on that map.
[2:10:05] <+SWFanatic> so they swim in circles
[2:10:09] <$Sphincter_Spelunker> @Lithdoran I was talking about the in game name
[2:10:09] <%Chichen> thats new gridania
[2:10:10] <%Keyd00d> you're not on this map
[2:10:10] <@SoFarFetched> not the right map
[2:10:20] <+FunkyStreams> Oh, it's the mouse.
[2:10:38] <Lithdoran> @Sphincter_Spelunker my b
[2:10:40] <watts121> I've heard better
[2:10:43] <%dankjerri> dmca
[2:10:46] <%Dakuu75> Girdania is never, not-lit
[2:10:49] <%dankjerri> well...maybe not
[2:10:57] <$Sphincter_Spelunker> @Lithdoran no worries, I've read Moby Dick, it's fucked
[2:11:16] <+SWFanatic> Hi Boss, I smacked that shit up
[2:11:19] <GarbageQueenEllie> @Sphincter_Spelunker Like in a good way or a bad way
[2:11:27] <$Sphincter_Spelunker> the not fun way
[2:11:39] <+The_Protagonist> Lancer? I hardly know her.
[2:11:51] <GarbageQueenEllie> @Sphincter_Spelunker Plague makes it sound way better than it probably is.
[2:11:56] <Lithdoran> @GarbageQueenEllie In the racist way
[2:12:05] <$Sphincter_Spelunker> @GarbageQueenEllie like imagine obsessing over an Ex. that's Moby Dick
[2:12:10] <$shurtal> Man i'm not looking forward to the stat squish, i like being big beefm'n
[2:12:27] <+chiazam> "don't listen to him he's a dick"
[2:12:28] <Lithdoran> I'm looking forward to Reaper doe
[2:12:54] <%juxtest> Time to give up on this spear crap and go be a Pugilist
[2:13:08] <$GarbageNirvana> Congrats, you can go be something other than a floor tank now
[2:13:25] <%JenovasPuppet> Get paid
[2:13:27] <+Lordgale119> I'm really curious about how they're going to change Paladin, since every class they push in an expac gets a major rework or buff
[2:13:30] <+FingaLights> My mama was right!
[2:13:32] <@Velyndra> "he stole my lancer rock, time to be something else"
[2:13:32] <MarylandJutsu> yeah you can do a lot of classes
[2:13:32] <$GarbageNirvana> (nah but srsly DRG's p neat)
[2:13:35] <Azathotic> There's something hilarious about Paige's first class being the one that eats the most shit
[2:13:42] <Lithdoran> Except DRK, AST, SAM, RDM, or GNB
[2:13:42] <%miabyte> @PeachSaliva I recommend Blue Mage Kappa
[2:13:48] <Lithdoran> You can't be those yet
[2:13:50] <+chiazam> Anything IN GRIDANIA
[2:13:59] <MayShip> the drip sets
[2:14:00] <$Sphincter_Spelunker> PvP DansGame
[2:14:04] <metboy_pully> The lancer is a nifty story... And yeah, gear sets!
[2:14:09] <%dankjerri> for the next couple levels anyway
[2:14:09] <GarbageQueenEllie> I would totally do Blue Mage simply for da fashiooon
[2:14:09] <@SoFarFetched> need more levels
[2:14:11] <+UltraViolet371> or MCH or DNC
[2:14:14] <+RoByte2> Gear for PvP, yeah those were the days
[2:14:35] <Lithdoran> Who cares about physical ranged DPS classes Kappa?
[2:14:44] <%JenovasPuppet> That's a good one for flying.
[2:14:44] <Lithdoran> Kappa
[2:14:46] <+SWFanatic> Does Paige care not for crafting?
[2:15:03] <metboy_pully> What data center is this on? I give stuff to new players.
[2:15:11] <%JenovasPuppet> @SWFanatic Impossible to tell, since this is her first MMO and she hasn't tried it yet.
[2:15:21] <@SoFarFetched> @metboy_pully trades are not open and she has pat to help give her stuff.
[2:15:32] <MayShip> you can also click on the stone on the map to teleport
[2:15:48] <$Sphincter_Spelunker> oh god, don't let her tank
[2:15:50] <olaksi> someone has to keep eye on the floor, can't trust it
[2:15:54] <$Sphincter_Spelunker> I beg you
[2:15:55] <TheFramedWarlock> Yeah, they are known as that LUL
[2:16:10] <metboy_pully> @SoFarFetched FAIR ENOUGH! And yeah, as a lancer I often keep the floor from killing the party.
[2:16:12] <%Reaped_Psyche> We're a noble people...  Very grounded...
[2:16:13] <%JenovasPuppet> Wait where did that cactuar umbrella come from? Did I miss an event award???
[2:16:17] <%Dakuu75> there's umbrellas?! damn, that's cool
[2:16:20] <+Aeoneth> @Sphincter_Spelunker It's appropriate that she is a DRG she has traiing already in floor tanking
[2:16:27] <TerryTheTurret> @Sphincter_Spelunker Don't worry DRG is a good tank for beginners.
[2:16:29] <%CappuccinoGuil> You'll get there!
[2:16:29] <OneThousandTomatoes> you'll figure it out eventually
[2:16:39] <+FunkyStreams> whatch out, Pat. These bella' bros be mackin on ya girl.
[2:16:40] <$Sphincter_Spelunker> There's beginners, then there's Paige
[2:16:41] <%Reaped_Psyche> They're all holding umbrellas over her.  This is so wholesome.
[2:16:45] <metboy_pully> (DRG is not actually a tank)
[2:17:00] <%crow114> crow114 subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 19 months! 19 months of big and strong
[2:17:02] <%CappuccinoGuil> You're starting off in a better spot than me. I played ALL of ARR with mouse and keyboard, so change to gamepad took a while
[2:17:14] <+Aeoneth> @Sphincter_Spelunker Yes but she has IRL experience with floor tanking
[2:17:17] <+SWFanatic> Eyyyy Kupo *Finger guns*
[2:17:20] <OneThousandTomatoes> nope
[2:17:21] <Latija> LOL
[2:17:21] <LordDudeTheFirst> Wow
[2:17:22] <+bluedude153> jjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjesus

[2:17:33] <+WeLucklessJacks> BONK
[2:17:34] <%SenorCounter> yeah it's a hentai thing
[2:17:35] <GarbageQueenEllie> Isn't that a Yu Gi Oh thing
[2:17:36] <%hoodedlefty> Noooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooo
[2:17:37] <+CalderGaming> cringe donation
[2:17:40] <%pokefan9956> did....did somebody just ask that
[2:17:40] <+bluedude153> I hate it
[2:17:42] <%CappuccinoGuil> *UNLIMITED BONK WORKS*
[2:17:42] <%kid_flashionable> is it better to play with controller or keyboard with a mouse??
[2:17:45] <$Ralfclogs> Cringe
[2:17:48] <+FunkyStreams> what?
[2:17:52] <+FingaLights> I don't see that tag on the stream, so no?
[2:17:53] <+Lordgale119> why even
[2:17:54] <JanusII> #mindbreak
[2:17:55] <DrStinkers> me am become huge
[2:17:57] <OneThousandTomatoes> @kid_flashionable whatever you want
[2:18:02] <%Chichen> keeping ya dry
[2:18:03] <Azathotic> Y'all acting like Pat wouldn't say the same thing on stream
[2:18:06] <%stoatacious> @kid_flashionable you can do both, I'd personally say controller for comfort
[2:18:08] <+bluedude153> @kid_flashionable Keyboard and Mouse is waaaay less clunky but controller is just fine
[2:18:08] <TerryTheTurret> @kid_flashionable Both are good, whichever you're more comfortable with
[2:18:11] <$Sphincter_Spelunker> @kid_flashionable people have been saying controller is better than most
[2:18:16] <+Lordgale119> @Azathotic yeah but he gets to
[2:18:17] <%kid_flashionable> ooh I see
[2:18:23] <%Garthunox> cant plead the fifth in canada
[2:18:29] <%pokefan9956> @azathotic there's a difference between pat saying it and a random stranger saying it
[2:18:33] <DrStinkers> @kid_flashionable controller is more comfy except for the 1% where you just have to click on something
[2:18:42] <%CappuccinoGuil> @kid_flashionable depends on your setup. Gamepad is comfier, keyboard is snappier. If you got a TV and a place to sit comfortably away from it, gamepad is real good for that
[2:18:48] <pogo_hobo> you'll get used to everything soon
[2:18:49] <%kid_flashionable> thanks everyone! I've only ever played with keyboard and mouse so I was curious
[2:18:49] <metboy_pully> I don't own a controller, so can't judge between them.
[2:18:54] <$Sphincter_Spelunker> "we"
[2:18:58] <%pokefan9956> boooo
[2:19:00] <+SWFanatic> damn
[2:19:06] <+Lordgale119> dam
[2:19:08] <%kid_flashionable> maybe I'll try out controller sometime!
[2:19:10] <pogo_hobo> learning dps opener with controller was a daunting for me at first
[2:19:12] <UvBenServed> LUL LUL LUL
[2:19:13] <MayShip> controller with WXHB is really cool
[2:19:20] <+SWFanatic> right in the babymaker
[2:19:30] <%Reaped_Psyche> SHE WAS FAKING THOSE EGGS!  WE ALL KNOW SHE'S BARREN
[2:19:31] <JanusII> Chococide. leaflitNotlikethis
[2:19:33] <%juxtest> mmm chocomurder
[2:19:36] <+FunkyStreams> Is Square paying her for this?
[2:19:38] <+Mekhet09> Oh man, paige there's going to be a dark twist on the party story line.
[2:19:38] <%Dakuu75> CHOCOBO MURDER~?! HANG THEM~!
[2:19:39] <pogo_hobo> yeah they nailed controller in this game (abit better than ffxi)
[2:19:53] <OneThousandTomatoes> @funkystreams its not sponsored, thats just to cover chat
[2:19:54] <+Lordgale119> BIG REVENGE MURDER
[2:19:55] <%nip_nips> oh no
[2:19:58] <%CappuccinoGuil> @kid_flashionable let give you a BIG tip: you can use the controller's d-pad to precisely move stuff in the Hud Layout. Need to move something exactly 3 points to the left? Tap 3 times on the d-pad.
[2:20:12] <pogo_hobo> kill the ratty snoots
[2:20:15] <+SWFanatic> you made friends
[2:20:18] <%juxtest> WHO have to die now?
[2:20:24] <%kid_flashionable> @cappuccinoguil oh shit that's actually really nice to know
[2:20:28] <+SWFanatic> healer aggro
[2:20:30] <Monkeyweed21> they broke an egg you need to slaughter them all
[2:20:43] <xbb1024> Kill their children!
[2:21:00] <MayShip> their peoples egg crimes cannot be forgiven
[2:21:01] <+Lordgale119> kill them all, paige. You need the exp and they totally deserve it
[2:21:06] <$Sphincter_Spelunker> just a little genocide. as a treat
[2:21:06] <+SWFanatic> healer tank
[2:21:08] <+FunkyStreams> EPIC BATTLE COMPLETE
[2:21:09] <%CappuccinoGuil> @kid_flashionable I used my controller to touch up positions for my keyboard layout once I found out. It's beautiful.
[2:21:12] <%Dakuu75> chocobo murderers get no quarter
[2:21:24] <haisho> big strong woman murders tiny rat people
[2:21:44] <%kid_flashionable> @cappuccinoguil I'm still trying to figure out my HUD as a white mage but it's so fun to customize
[2:21:49] <+Lordgale119> not just the men, but the women, and the scramblers
[2:21:53] <pogo_hobo> hey leave koji alone
[2:21:54] <+snugglepuggs> Murder and pillage those undesirables
[2:21:59] <MayShip> the sprout drip
[2:22:07] <Monkeyweed21> DONT DO IT BLOODBATH
[2:22:11] <OneThousandTomatoes> drink their blood
[2:22:16] <@JustinianKnight> its lifesteal yes
[2:22:17] <%JenovasPuppet> Feed off the blood of your enemies!
[2:22:18] <%miabyte> paige like money, Send Money
[2:22:21] <metboy_pully> It's an extra way to self-heal in battle.
[2:22:22] <pogo_hobo> u get heals for hurting people lol
[2:22:24] <$Sphincter_Spelunker> like Rally in bloodborne
[2:22:24] <+healnavi> Has Paige realized that this game's characters have the big racism yet?
[2:22:25] <JanusII> Pretend it's red mustard.
[2:22:26] <%CappuccinoGuil> @kid_flashionable Hud Layout is the true FF14 experience. I love it.
[2:22:38] <$hrbeck_> bathe in blood to retain youth
[2:22:43] <+SWFanatic> Come at me you bastard Aahhhhhh
[2:22:43] <Tukenfarben> Plucking blue trumpets definitely sounds like a sex thing...
[2:22:45] <OneThousandTomatoes> not everything is a sex thing
[2:22:49] <+FunkyStreams> Just like Pat's ass.
[2:22:50] <LordDudeTheFirst> Eh The bestmen are weird anyway
[2:22:50] <%kid_flashionable> @cappuccinoguil I thought it was fashion rlyGottem
[2:22:54] <+snugglepuggs> Dumb bard
[2:22:56] <%pokefan9956> everything is a sex thing
[2:22:57] <$JoshManVGH> Dost thou verily
[2:23:00] <$Sphincter_Spelunker> @OneThousandTomatoes that's quitter talk
[2:23:09] <%CappuccinoGuil> @kid_flashionable I'm a free trial player, I don't play fashion the same way sipsipHellmo
[2:23:32] <%kid_flashionable> @cappuccinoguil and as a person just starting again in ARR, I'm totally in there with you sipsipHellmo
[2:23:35] <$Sphincter_Spelunker> so when are those glasses getting here
[2:23:38] <+Lordgale119> we must needs speak like this
[2:23:52] <+CalderGaming> EVERYONE saw that
[2:23:53] <@commanderclaw> You're not dumb, you're doing your best!
[2:23:54] <%JenovasPuppet> lol Pat's name disappears when he's in the party because she can ONLY see non-party friend names
[2:23:55] <LlamaByDay> Saw what
[2:23:59] <@commanderclaw> You're learning and that's okay
[2:24:02] <$JoshManVGH> No witnesses!
[2:24:02] <%nip_nips> THINGS WERE SEEN
[2:24:04] <Servantproto> the map Paige, the map
[2:24:06] <haisho> Everything was seen. Nothing will be forgotten.
[2:24:11] <+SWFanatic> blam

[2:24:13] <$Sphincter_Spelunker> I heard it. Therefore I saw it twice

[2:26:59] <$hrbeck_> well, guess what- the localization team loves this
[2:27:01] <metboy_pully> See the ^ on the icon?
[2:27:03] <Xenokun> Quest Icon is indicating up
[2:27:09] <JanusII> The icons on the map have up arrows if they're above you.
[2:27:09] <%Chichen> the marker also has an arrow
[2:27:10] <@JustinianKnight> theres a little ^
[2:27:11] <%Keyd00d> if you look real close at the icon
[2:27:11] <%JenovasPuppet> ^^^^^^^^
[2:27:15] <$hrbeck_> the arrows
[2:27:16] <%CappuccinoGuil> Someone tell Paige about the ^ v symbols next to the quest icon
[2:27:16] <%Keyd00d> it can be hard to see tho
[2:27:19] <+SWFanatic> oh no
[2:27:20] <$skizzuto> The quest icon has a ^ to indicate it's above you
[2:27:24] <%Ranryu692> the green check mark also has a little ^ on it
[2:27:25] <AdmiralButtloaf> quest icons have arrows for elevation
[2:27:30] <%CappuccinoGuil> It's tiiiiiny
[2:27:31] <+Lordgale119> SUN is DOWN
[2:27:32] <%Keyd00d> it's kinda tiny
[2:27:33] <+SWFanatic> yeh
[2:27:36] <%Chichen> its the gold ^
[2:27:40] <%Chichen> on it
[2:27:44] <%Keyd00d> next to the green check
[2:27:46] <%CappuccinoGuil> Yellow arrow, on the right of the marker
[2:27:49] <%JenovasPuppet> Slightly to the right of the checkmark
[2:27:49] <%nip_nips> its not green, its yellow
[2:27:49] <%Reaped_Psyche> It's not green
[2:27:52] <%Ranryu692> @PeachSaliva a yellow ^ on top of the green check
[2:27:53] <JanusII> Green checkmark, gold arrow ^
[2:27:53] <olaksi> ^
[2:27:56] <$skizzuto> It's yellow, touching the green checkmark
[2:27:59] <%SveriSageAdvice> little yellow arrow on the middle right part of the green check
[2:27:59] <+MisterrBlack> !uptime
[2:28:00] <$hrbeck_> it's yellow, it's small, it's on the icon
[2:28:03] <%Reaped_Psyche> Green check mark, yellow arrow.
[2:28:04] <AdmiralButtloaf> green check gold arrow
[2:28:05] <%Chichen> stream buffering?
[2:28:06] <+FunkyStreams> Paige is also colorblind.
[2:28:07] <$hrbeck_> you are blind
[2:28:09] <$Sphincter_Spelunker> uh huh
[2:28:10] <%CappuccinoGuil> The yellow arrow on the GREEN marker, Paige
[2:28:11] <+tomdwarf> Paige, its green.
[2:28:12] <+bluedude153> ????
[2:28:12] <%SveriSageAdvice> also when you mouse over it, it shows the up or down arrow
[2:28:13] <haisho> is yellow the new blue?
[2:28:13] <@SSaryn> Paige, that's Yellow and GREEN.
[2:28:14] <Hydel> lmao
[2:28:14] <%TheWinged7> the check is green, the arrow is yellow
[2:28:15] <+FunkyStreams> atop being blind.
[2:28:16] <%Keyd00d> and we can't see you
[2:28:18] <Rumbutt> but back in the day we didn't have that
[2:28:19] <OneThousandTomatoes> thats why I make my minimap bigger
[2:28:19] <+snugglepuggs> It’s indigo
[2:28:21] <%Keyd00d> Patrick
[2:28:21] <Xenokun> It is small, but you are also a bit blind
[2:28:21] <+SWFanatic> smol pat
[2:28:25] <%JenovasPuppet> It's not the clearest, but there used to be NOTHING to indicate height.
[2:28:26] <RyuuAoi> Peach, put on your new glasses!
[2:28:27] <@CreepyPorpoise> Yeah its yellow
[2:28:27] <Srthunda> I think its actually purple
[2:28:27] <@SSaryn> You're crazy.
[2:28:28] <%Ranryu692> no, you're correct
[2:28:28] <JanusII> You're right.
[2:28:29] <@CreepyPorpoise> Pat bad at colors
[2:28:30] <%SenorCounter> I mean honestly the mark should be at the top of the green check rather then to the side.
[2:28:31] <%Keyd00d> she's right
[2:28:32] <supergoblinpunch> Patalymo
[2:28:32] <$Sphincter_Spelunker> Shoulda named yourself Peach JOhns
[2:28:33] <@CreepyPorpoise> it is known
[2:28:34] <@MelBrooksKA> Both
[2:28:34] <%CappuccinoGuil> yes, that's what Pat said XD
[2:28:34] <%nip_nips> pats colorblind again
[2:28:34] <tacostarvedbeast> listen
[2:28:35] <+bluedude153> Do you want us to answer that
[2:28:38] <@SoFarFetched> is it though
[2:28:50] <+snugglepuggs> Peach blind. Pat colorblind
[2:28:54] <@SSaryn> Everyone is bad at everything here.
[2:28:56] <Dhurkst> wait paige is colorblind?
[2:28:56] <%Ranryu692> Pat can't even tell the difference between Blue and Indigo
[2:29:00] <+FunkyStreams> At that point the people at the clinic were probably just rying to get on with their day.
[2:29:02] <%Bane_Kaikyo> What's up with Paige's music? I starts up and random then fades away for no reason leaving only silence
[2:29:03] <olaksi> the eye doctor said my colorblindness is 100%
[2:29:04] <Vermillion129> Such a perfect couple
[2:29:04] <@JustinianKnight> time to bring back the Gamecube debate lol
[2:29:06] <PanicSwytch> Pat confirmed colorblind
[2:29:08] <%Dakuu75> aren't there Malboro around here somewhere?
[2:29:12] <tacostarvedbeast> TWYANE
[2:29:16] <%AncelDeLambert> ROBIN GETS ANOTHER SHOT!
[2:29:17] <%Keyd00d> I member
[2:29:20] <%AncelDeLambert> LET'S DO THE CHOP!
[2:29:21] <+wizard_of_diamonds> Don't let it sink in
[2:29:28] <+abrupt_abe> Robin gets another shot?
[2:29:29] <OneThousandTomatoes> @bane_kaikyo if you stand still for a long time it stops
[2:29:32] <@SoFarFetched> WE MAAAYY LOOK LIKE SISSYS,BUT WATCH WHAT YOU SAY OR ELSE WE'LL PUT OUT YOUR LIGHTS
[2:29:33] <%SenorCounter> I always laughed at the spit he threw when saying it
[2:29:33] <$Sphincter_Spelunker> member the 80's
[2:29:36] <RyuuAoi> Pat has astigmatism so he's basically blind too. He has his moments.
[2:29:39] <+RoByte2> "I lost. I lost? Wait a minute, I'm not supposed to lose. Let me see the script."
[2:29:42] <OneThousandTomatoes> in agroable areas, not city states
[2:29:47] <%JenovasPuppet> Delicious money
[2:29:48] <%SenorCounter> Take out scrips*
[2:29:50] <+FingaLights> @Ranryu692 Pat "There the same picture" 🟦 🟪
[2:29:54] <%Bane_Kaikyo> @OneThousandTomatoes but she is moving now and no music
[2:30:02] <+FingaLights> They're*
[2:30:09] <%AncelDeLambert> I love the gag of them checking the script
[2:30:10] <%Keyd00d> the next quest is almost always the same person you're next to
[2:30:17] <+wizard_of_diamonds> I don't understand the need to constantly hover a streamer layer
[2:30:17] <%ElkRiverDog> Lend me your ears! *splat splat splat*
[2:30:17] <%AncelDeLambert> "he does, he does..."
[2:30:20] <+wizard_of_diamonds> player*
[2:30:29] <Vermillion129> Pat cant identified his favourite color, blue Kappa
[2:30:36] <+Lordgale119> shadowfellow
[2:30:43] <%AncelDeLambert> Paige, does space exist?
[2:30:49] <+RoByte2> @ElkRiverDog That's disgusting!
[2:31:07] <%pokefan9956> he doesn't know blue and purple
[2:31:08] <$shurtal> in this case he was syaing green arrow, when he meant green checkmark, so he doesn't know his shapes
[2:31:10] <+RelikaNox> @Bane_Kaikyo The base game kinda does that with the non-city zone music. Once the expansions hit the music just keeps playing
[2:31:24] <+snugglepuggs> A pity pass for the test
[2:31:30] <%RealThiele> note deez nuts
[2:31:36] <$Sphincter_Spelunker> gottem
[2:31:44] <%Bane_Kaikyo> @RelikaNox I don't remember it being that bad when I played
[2:31:59] <@SoFarFetched> Remember there's people who still think pat hates music Kappa
[2:32:02] <%Dakuu75> a lot
[2:32:03] <RyuuAoi> Pat paid doctors to give him 20/20 on the test to rub it into Peach.
[2:32:04] <+CookieCutter007> this idiot
[2:32:05] <olaksi> wow, paige thinks space doesn't exist??
[2:32:06] <%pokefan9956> it's so clearly a coping mechanism for fear of space dumbasses lol
[2:32:08] <@SoFarFetched> when it was just to get everyone to shut up about music choices.
[2:32:09] <bleugh> paige is a flat earther confirmed
[2:32:11] <%Keyd00d> space <exists>
[2:32:13] <JanusII> Oh God we're existing in space right now.
[2:32:13] <SpaceCapnCrone> I mean, Space will kill you just for being there.
[2:32:14] <wasalujaco> pat hates music confirmed
[2:32:14] <+snugglepuggs> Everyone
[2:32:16] <+chiazam> Paige you believe Abraham Lincoln is HAUNTING YOU
[2:32:16] <Vermillion129> We always take it seriously for both of you
[2:32:18] <metboy_pully> Space exists, and won't pass on a chance to kill you.
[2:32:18] <GarbageQueenEllie> Is Math related to SPACE?
[2:32:18] <%JenovasPuppet> Space by definition does not exist.
[2:32:20] <%SenorCounter> Space and space Lincoln
[2:32:22] <%fetrigon> paige doesn't believe in space?! LUL
[2:32:23] <stoic_nod> Have any of us SEEN space?
[2:32:24] <%grapplingwithdepression> grapplingwithdepression subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 6 months, currently on a 6 month streak! I have once again returned for what seems to be my monthly stream message. Glad to see you're playing xiv now, have fun!
[2:32:24] <TerryTheTurret> I mean...space is nothingness so in a way technically it doesn't.
[2:32:26] <Monkeyweed21> are you excited for everyone to live in space working for Amazon
[2:32:26] <%Ranryu692> Paige doesn't think that space doesn't exist, she just prefers to pretend that Star Trek takes place at night
[2:32:28] <+wizard_of_diamonds> Does Paige play with her map on?
[2:32:28] <$Sphincter_Spelunker> stop Flanderizing Paige's character. She can do that on her own
[2:32:30] <+AmanisHouseOfNonsense> Space is real, and it's stealing your pee from your balls right now.
[2:32:30] <xbb1024> 3 dimensions doesn't exist
[2:32:31] <@JustinianKnight> theres no Honest Abe in space
[2:32:38] <Mechz71> Does the down force exists tho
[2:32:39] <Purpleleven> Man, its been awhile since I've jsut walked around in the Black Shroud, brings back memories
[2:32:41] <%Keyd00d> Enemies with the red icon will attack ya
[2:32:46] <olaksi> dimensions exists so space exists
[2:32:47] <%CopperTucker> Paige didn't you say on-stream that you didn't believe in space
[2:32:54] <RetroCop87> this chat is full of cringey idiots, of course there are people who will take it seriously
[2:32:55] <Xenokun> This situations was certainly DIE

[2:33:18] <+snugglepuggs> Yes
[2:33:18] <%grapplingwithdepression> Wait hold on why did no one tell paige to use macro 99 if shes using a pad?
[2:33:18] <%CopperTucker> you said it during the Dead Presidents stream
[2:33:19] <Khester824> in space is always night time
[2:33:19] <@JustinianKnight> wow

[2:33:21] <RyuuAoi> Probably
[2:33:22] <%Keyd00d> Yes, clearly that's the normal one
[2:33:22] <%Kenzo2000> I t was after we had to tell you that Santa was real too
[2:33:30] <+snugglepuggs> “Dark thing”
[2:33:30] <OneThousandTomatoes> i think
