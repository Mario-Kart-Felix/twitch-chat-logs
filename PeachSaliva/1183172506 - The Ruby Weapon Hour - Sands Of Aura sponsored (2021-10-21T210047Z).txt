[0:27:22] <%maskofmichael> Cheer500 Hey Paige, can you help me find somebody? I think they may be in chat. They're name is Maya Buttreeks.
[0:27:24] <%maenos2> @waltzqueen thanks!  It has been so far.  only lingering issues are nerve pains in my left leg and a weird lack of temperature sense.
[0:27:27] <Teyaric> But SAVING. Meaning it's not remotely like dark souls at all????
[0:27:40] <%Kurt_0> Bells = bonfire
[0:27:44] <drawerinkshow> You also drop your stuff on Diablo and Torchlight
[0:27:46] <Faithless_Zealot> Hi Paige

[0:28:12] <%waltzqueen> @maenos2 glad things are going well, man. and hey! now you can eat cookie fresh from the oven without hurting. Probably still cooks your tounge tho, so probably shouldnt
[0:28:15] <%Kurt_0> Beeg swing
[0:28:38] <%MarylandJutsu> @maskofmichael allright bart simpsons
[0:28:58] <Teyaric> This is some WRITING/Voice-Acting
[0:29:12] <%Kurt_0> Effigy = dark souls
[0:29:20] <%MarylandJutsu> we must offer elmooooo
[0:29:20] <%maenos2> @waltzqueen hah yeah, I was wary of stovetops for a while but it slowly returns.  I can finally feel some cold and heat is distant.  I'm told those nerves take a while to recover.  baby steps.
[0:29:43] <+trackles_64> F Pat
[0:29:46] <%Kurt_0> Big combo = beeg damage

[0:30:15] <%Kurt_0> sipsipRude
[0:30:18] <%ComfortableStranger> Paige do big UNGA BUNGA
[0:30:35] <mr_saturday93> Paige doing strategy? Don't hurt yourself
[0:30:40] <%Kurt_0> Use big brain
[0:31:02] <%Kurt_0> Oh that’s cool
[0:31:55] <tanarath> J U M P
[0:32:05] <%Kurt_0> Don’t miss
[0:32:30] <drawerinkshow> Big hammer where?
[0:32:32] <tanarath> Paige, special
[0:32:39] <%Kurt_0> Bigger sword where
[0:33:09] <%Kurt_0> Damn I gotta get this game
[0:33:39] <%MarylandJutsu> so we're celes from ff6....cool
[0:33:48] <tanarath> Sorry for backseating, I'll shut up
[0:33:49] <Ides42> these numbers are very specific
[0:34:19] <+detbasil> Can your fire wall hurt you?
[0:34:21] <%skm742> I think the animation on the third swing probably needs touching up. It looks like it moves vertical towards the end, so the last swing doesn't do a full sweep for the end of the combo. I'd say it should either be a full swing, or a stab to make it more clear the hitbox isn't another arc.
[0:34:30] <%MarylandJutsu> so pat will like the numbers?
[0:34:44] <hearingthenseeing> Oh no, not math
[0:35:04] <%MarylandJutsu> we have acquired.....pants
[0:35:19] <%Kurt_0> Equip the pant
[0:36:01] <+Sternold123> What's up with the resolution?

[0:36:03] <+detbasil> Do we have a full release date?
[0:36:15] <%Kurt_0> She scream when hit
[0:36:20] <drawerinkshow> BRUH

[0:37:10] <%MarylandJutsu> Bell said perish paige
[0:37:10] <%Landedx> Paige you have your special attacks
[0:37:15] <+Bailey__Gaming> Run Away!
[0:37:25] <+Bailey__Gaming> Poke and Run!
[0:37:26] <%Kurt_0> This is bad
[0:37:40] <+TopTieramisu> this is ds2 all over again
[0:38:01] <hearingthenseeing> optimal
[0:38:06] <%Kurt_0> She did it
[0:38:45] <drawerinkshow> Smash shield

[0:48:33] <SpookyMooks> there was a sparkly
[0:48:41] <Deft_Thought> Needed to channel that Eric Andre energy
[0:49:26] <+Dakuu75> These visuals remind me of harry potter for w/e reason
[0:49:31] <heartlesshealer> there was a sparkly, but there might be a fall death distance and the character was supposed to find a different way down =\
