[0:12:49] <%SWFanatic> We do it
[0:12:52] <+ThatGuyfromMars> God the frozen world in KH3 is awful. It's just a shitty rehash of the movie, THEY EVEN REUSE MOVIE FOOTAGE
[0:12:57] <%Skrypto> <3
[0:12:58] <Plutt_bug> Thanks go up
[0:12:59] <Ir_ramble> when the live action version of Black Cauldron, Disney?
[0:12:59] <%oddslogic> still the best peach
[0:12:59] <Zaphire_Saucypants> they just ripped off the the whole Let It Go scene, song and all, but with Sora in the back goin "whaa? Whoaaa."
[0:13:00] <$Gr4ndm4rsh4ll> @GohanEgret spaghetti and meatballs!
[0:13:00] <Skatedeandre> Frozen world is pretty bad
[0:13:03] <RichAnvils> BIG SPEAK LOUD GOOD
[0:13:03] <+ChaosVulpes> Frozen in Kingdom Hearts 3 was basically Sora and crew getting thrown off a mountain repeatedly and only meeting the main characters like once. The boss fight was pretty rad though, basically fighting the Heartless version of Fenrir
[0:13:03] <+skizzuto> KH3 frozen world was overly long for what was essentially a boring rehash of the movie plot, but I personally don't think it was as bad as everyone else
[0:13:03] <tacostarvedbeast> Big hero 69
[0:13:04] <DavidSanChan> Twirl stick for fat stacks
[0:13:04] <honestab33> the add where the dude drinks ranch through a straw makes me physically nauseous every single time

[0:13:10] <%harryf11> Kh3 is worst kh, sorry not sorry
[0:13:10] <Dio_TR> HAS THE OINK STARTED YET
[0:13:11] <%MightyMaxT> Frozen wasn't bad, imo. Just fine. The fact that it was praised as the second coming is what makes it bad
[0:13:11] <GohanEgret> @Gr4ndm4rsh4ll thank you dark souls

I’m been still applying for jobs and don’t know when it will ever end with me finding a new job, so I have been off the Pat and Paige streams grids. Since Pat calling himself a rock, can we call you Stone Cold Peach Austin? Anyway, I hope you have a wonderful stream tonight. Love your voice in the recent Plague’s vid, loving the glasses you wearing, and if they appear, shake the Elmo bag and shake the Pat!! (I betcha Red Bull cans will fall out.)

[0:30:01] <%wingblade7> is bill a mod or actual content in game?
[0:30:02] <+lethallunacyx> I expect you to unleash your 8th gate bankai

[0:30:26] <soutakuphi> @PeachSaliva hey paige curious to know if you ever are interested in playing Ahegao Academy the SBFP fangame one day, maybe for valentines day?
[0:30:27] <ItsRatman> @wingblade7 real, but not the same voice actor
[0:30:27] <%QueequegTheater> No
[0:30:29] <justinwhang> Sup dawg
[0:30:29] <KaptainKappathe5th> >hot pocket anus
[0:30:31] <aimlesshealer> Only Peach
[0:30:32] <%Raxus_Secundus> You're welcome
[0:30:34] <+badchoice5> But what if we don't watch for the game?
[0:30:36] <DuoScratch> @PeachSaliva another good perk to have, is something like Bond or Empathy, so you can keep track of other survivors too. Bond is a bit stronger, but shorter range, while Empathy needs a survivor to be hurt to see them, but at max rank, it's unlimited range.
[0:30:38] <%ElenaManetta> other plays? oh, okay. (cancels donation to give to that guy)
[0:30:39] <%QueequegTheater> That turns some people on, I hear
[0:30:39] <%krawtch> but this is how you learn what not to do :D
[0:30:41] <tacostarvedbeast> No
[0:30:41] <+pyrophant> do you play this game a lot?
[0:30:42] <hntronium> But I don't want to watch those people though

[0:32:03] <%l3sovikk> @PeachSaliva You're my favorite Vulpix!
[0:32:07] <CrimsonFox777> I thought she could only see them if she had an ultra-rare add-on. Could be mistaken.

[0:32:11] <SulfurousAcid> I think spine chill ignores stealth yeah
[0:32:13] <$Corporate_Redeemer> I hope it's a RUSSIAN ROULETTE Spirit
[0:32:14] <+badchoice5> Don't read this and focus on the prompt
[0:32:14] <%rumtumtugnutz> Thirsty Vulpix
[0:32:15] <%maskedriderhero> Why do the survivors scratch everything when they walk, they need to trim their nails
[0:32:15] <+Story_Ark> @owllightningmage pat became a rock because rocks dont pee or poop
[0:32:16] <AirlineFood74> @ThatGuyfromMars it looks so bad LUL
[0:32:16] <%AncelDeLambert> I really wish the killers weren't so expensive, it's kinda bullshit
[0:32:17] <%king_wragles> Alright you heathens, BILL YOUR GOD has graced us! Praise him!
[0:32:20] <bigbradish> @ThatGuyfromMars looked like a PS2 game
[0:32:21] <nobknee> @PeachSaliva You should give Risk of Rain a shot. Get Pat grumpy and be good at the game.
[0:32:25] <Conky89> That is some spidey sense shit right there

[0:33:13] <%psychodave1234> uh oh im thinkin about it
[0:33:17] <@StridentSong> Scratches
[0:33:21] <AMajorTom> Lockers are cheating, and not intended by the developers
[0:33:23] <%AncelDeLambert> Blood is Wraith
[0:33:24] <Fujiwara_92> go save ppl
[0:33:26] <$Corporate_Redeemer> No that's the Wraith's perk
[0:33:27] <TheStarbecue> CAT GO OFF
[0:33:29] <@StridentSong> She can see scratches while in spirit mode
[0:33:32] <+Story_Ark> @peachsaliva do you think they could ever make a dbd killer that can disguise themselves as a survivor?
[0:33:33] <@Calek> what's so bad about lockers
[0:33:33] <%2Metronomes> Nah, she doesnt have blood stuff
[0:33:33] <+badchoice5> Man stream snipers would absolutely ruin Paige wouldn't they
[0:33:34] <+Badgerconda_> WHO'S TALKING
[0:33:36] <%AncelDeLambert> and it's STILL not bright enough with the Wraith

[0:33:45] <+TheDullaMAN> Can she see why kids love CInnamon Toast Crunch?
[0:33:52] <+MagickBurritoh> she's coming?
[0:34:00] <ShichiNoBushi> She goes that way. I'll go home.
[0:34:01] <@StridentSong> @Calek If you get caught in a locker, it's an automatic downed and caught state for the killer. She can just carry you to a hook
[0:34:05] <+ThatGuyfromMars> @rudybrossard she said that pat is pretty tired so he's gonna chill in bed with emlo
[0:34:12] <%king_wragles> Why did they call it that?
[0:34:13] <DuoScratch> If you're in a locker, BBQ won't show you.

[0:34:52] <@StridentSong> Yeap. Also the lockers make noise when you enter them, so if the killer is close enough to hear it, they can generally figure out where you are
[0:34:58] <%maskedriderhero> @DeathsDoom It's Paige's Patrick Stick
[0:35:05] <%2Metronomes> We are seconds away from oink
[0:35:06] <%AbnormalVoid> just the ass

[0:35:38] <aimlesshealer> Ass was passed

[0:36:54] <TerraWraith> Run away like I do from my responsibilities!
[0:36:59] <+badchoice5> Paige refuses to battle the woman, a first

[0:37:25] <nutimik> Really good jukers and bodyblockers are the best survivors though

[0:37:28] <%AncelDeLambert> I caught him anyways, but god it was annoying
[0:37:30] <$HarraceHarrison> Hurl pallets at them for maximum points

[0:37:53] <%QueequegTheater> @Doctor_Death_Bed LUL
[0:37:57] <@Calek> this is a bold move by her cotton, let's see if it pays off
[0:37:58] <+thebonebard> last year is fun but its the voice chat that makes that game super fun, shockingly the forced lack of push to talk makes that game way better
[0:38:01] <exalt4747> New class added: Pat
[0:38:02] <%AncelDeLambert> cat?
[0:38:04] <Dakuu75> the cat is back?
[0:38:06] <%Doctor_Death_Bed> oh sorry that's my general message for all streamers I watch
[0:38:08] <%oKentucky> i thought her sweater said JEWISH
[0:38:08] <nutimik> her perk
[0:38:09] <benjiFG> you're doing nice so far, I wonder why

[0:38:15] <%AncelDeLambert> the cat is back in town, the cat is back in tooooooown
[0:38:25] <+ThatGuyfromMars> @benjiFG paige is surprisingly good at DBD
[0:38:26] <nutimik> she means the cat perk
[0:38:32] <%AncelDeLambert> heehehehe, basement time
[0:38:33] <Fujiwara_92> the cat? Elmo?
[0:38:35] <Plutt_bug> She CAN hear anything she is a woman
[0:38:36] <exalt4747> Pat's attributes are that he's really slow but he's a midget so you have to look directly down at him.
[0:38:37] <asaellan> Do you recommend buying last year the nightmare?? Is it a game that I will get sick of quick?
[0:38:39] <+MechaBaphomet> As fast as i can zoneThink

[0:39:11] <AirlineFood74> @PeachSaliva Did you hear that deku is racist now?
[0:39:14] <%maskedriderhero> Conti stop hunting monsters
[0:39:15] <$Corporate_Redeemer> Paige I recommend trying out Object of Obsession from Laurie to always see where the killer is. It sounds bad at first but it totally throws killers off their game
[0:39:19] <+ThatGuyfromMars> @Dakuu75 one is hooked so it's basically paige
[0:39:20] <riantDeliration> now i wanna play monhun damn

[0:40:01] <PSI_Guy95> honk
[0:40:03] <+badchoice5> It's endearing oinking, like a pet pig
[0:40:03] <%king_wragles> @PeachSaliva At least your tick isn't a full on sentence.
[0:40:05] <+Katmon27> i kinda wanna hear the oink
[0:40:05] <echodrone81> explain this oink
[0:40:05] <aiyobro> i'm on the last available missions in monHun, uncompletable by yourself
[0:40:06] <exalt4747> So how do you win?
[0:40:07] <$RC_S3kshun8> OInking?
[0:40:08] <SulfurousAcid> find the hatch
[0:40:08] <Dakuu75> @ThatGuyfromMars @king_wragles oh, I see
[0:40:08] <%jobbedbone> whats the bug feet around the one guy mean?
[0:40:09] <%SWFanatic> woolieREMEMBERS
[0:40:10] <Conky89> I predict oinks are coming soon.
[0:40:12] <person181> do it coward
[0:40:12] <RichAnvils> @PeachSaliva the oinker is endearing to us porkers
[0:40:12] <+ThatGuyfromMars> don't deny yourself the oink, paige.
[0:40:13] <IminyourBase> it helps me think
[0:40:15] <%MrBorisMakarov> LUL
[0:40:17] <DuoScratch> hatch time
[0:40:18] <AirlineFood74> JUST YOU
[0:40:18] <SulfurousAcid> FIND THE HATCH
[0:40:20] <%mercado94> LUL
[0:40:20] <Fujiwara_92> JUST DO IT
[0:40:22] <+skizzuto> but we're here for the weird oinks!
[0:40:22] <%AncelDeLambert> hatch time
[0:40:23] <+lethallunacyx> I need more oink though
[0:40:23] <buffmurffy> oink repression is unhealthy
[0:40:23] <+MechaBaphomet> This is a safe oinking space
[0:40:24] <$Corporate_Redeemer> HATCH QUEEN
[0:40:24] <SulfurousAcid> shovLUL
[0:40:25] <AirlineFood74> LAME IT OUT
[0:40:25] <ShichiNoBushi> Like Pat and the ghost sucking?
[0:40:26] <GohanEgret> apatHoldon
[0:40:28] <%TheFilth> sweat mode activate
[0:40:28] <%2Metronomes> Game over
[0:40:28] <+DK_Rance> oink oink
[0:40:28] <%AncelDeLambert> get on that HOOK!
[0:40:29] <+InsaneJackLondon> THEN THERE WAS ONE
[0:40:33] <+MagickBurritoh> she's the last one alive?
[0:40:34] <DuoScratch> Most commonly, it spawns near a generator
[0:40:36] <%WheatlyXT> apatBig apatHoldon
[0:40:38] <stiffybiro> what would win in a fight, 1 boink oink or 1 stronk honk?
[0:40:41] <$SiameseSneeze> wow, Paige is the last one alive
[0:40:41] <%MightyMaxT> I understand how this can be relaxing. You get super stressed playing the game and it lumps your "day-to-day" stress in with it, so when the game is over and the stress of it leaves, so does the everyday stress
[0:40:43] <$Corporate_Redeemer> apatDab apatDab apatDab apatDab apatDab for Paige
[0:40:43] <%ceaselessdiplomacy> as someone with ADHD you should oink if you need to
[0:40:44] <%AncelDeLambert> the second that hatch opens, fuck me I ain't finding ya
[0:40:47] <+badchoice5> One oink for safe, two oink for danger
[0:40:50] <%hawk_rush> just oink paige, you know you want to
[0:40:52] <%SergeantSov> oink
[0:40:57] <%Sphincter_Spelunker> Exactly, like Pat's ghost sucking. And Pat's nose touching. And Pat's eye rubbing
[0:40:58] <Laironx3> gotta let it out!
[0:40:59] <SulfurousAcid> do an oik
[0:41:00] <Yeajow> But to find the hatch she must see
[0:41:03] <$HarraceHarrison> You can head the hatch by the faint oinking sound it makes
[0:41:04] <+manwithboxonhead> 🐷
[0:41:04] <+ThatGuyfromMars> one oink for pat's fault, two oinks for paige's fault @badchoice5
[0:41:04] <%AncelDeLambert> ballsy
[0:41:10] <Bionicghost> what do you have crouch assigned to?
[0:41:12] <SulfurousAcid> surely the hatch is in the basement
[0:41:14] <Johno_san> hey idk if its been made known but is mama peach gonna have a v day stream or is daddy pat gonna hog her all to him self
[0:41:16] <Fujiwara_92> OINKING WILL HELP YOU, OINK PEACH OINK
[0:41:23] <%TheFilth> Gotta oink it out, gotta oink it out
[0:41:25] <%AncelDeLambert> hey, I found a hatch in the basement of the school, once
[0:41:29] <+ThatGuyfromMars> @Johno_san they did last year so it is possible
[0:41:30] <echodrone81> saw her
[0:41:34] <%ThePuddingDead> Oink for our amusement!
[0:41:35] <%wingblade7> what are the win conditions for the survivors?
[0:41:41] <$HarraceHarrison> "Basement Time" is my favorite point name
[0:41:43] <%WheatlyXT> survive
[0:41:45] <GohanEgret> nerd scott!
[0:41:48] <+badchoice5> If you are reading this you probably have better things to look at right now
[0:41:48] <Bionicghost> adapt
[0:41:50] <%ThePuddingDead> u realize your the last one alive right?
[0:41:51] <Bionicghost> evolve
[0:41:52] <Zaphire_Saucypants> oinking pleases the masses, Paige.
[0:41:52] <%king_wragles> @wingblade7 escape
[0:41:53] <deity_majora> oink oink oink
[0:41:55] <Johno_san> @ThatGuyfromMars ty for the hope!! :>

[0:42:08] <%SergeantSov> And we should start to hear some oinking
[0:42:12] <RodrigoBBarrenechea> oink you coward
[0:42:14] <%2Metronomes> @wingblade7 start all generators to power the door and escape, or find the hatch an escape
[0:42:18] <+MagickBurritoh> good circle
[0:42:19] <%jobbedbone> why does her sweater say jewish
[0:42:20] <+manwithboxonhead> 🐷
[0:42:21] <Dakuu75> do matches have time limits?
[0:42:21] <%hawk_rush> oink for us
[0:42:21] <+MechaBaphomet> You could echo locate with oinks
[0:42:22] <%ThePuddingDead> careful she might patrol
[0:42:27] <nutimik> do the hatches have set spawn points?
[0:42:27] <AirlineFood74> @wingblade7 turn on 4 generators and escape or as the last player alive you can escape through a hatch. The hatch is different in that all the generators don't need to be on
[0:42:28] <Fujiwara_92> OINK, YOU WON'T
[0:42:28] <ScreamingMeat> Year of the Oink
[0:42:31] <DuoScratch> She's probably already found it, and is camping.

[0:56:46] <captainthunderwolf> @QueequegTheater I've heard this exact opinion from devout fans, so it's probably pretty safe.
[0:56:46] <+TheDullaMAN> Paige feels comfortable around trash.

[0:58:02] <%QueequegTheater> @captainthunderwolf Fun fact: the molester backstory they used was actually Wes Craven's original plan for Freddy. I assume New Line Cinemas took one look at that in 1983 and said "FUCK NO, you're not having a kiddie rapist as a slasher villain"

[0:58:38] <+ThatGuyfromMars> @RowenCleric Freddy can't do damage to you unless you are asleep
[0:58:38] <%maskedriderhero> @RowenCleric Freddy can only effect you when you're asleep
[0:58:40] <%jobbedbone> @RowenCleric prerequisite for him to attack
[0:58:41] <+badchoice5> Isn't Yang still dead you guys?

[1:14:22] <GohanEgret> EXTRA ZESTY
[1:14:23] <%krawtch> everything is banned in OW because they spend more time trying to control the people playing the game, than actually working on the game
[1:14:23] <nutimik> then it's obviously sarcastic
[1:14:24] <+SuperPixelRush> ggez is toxic tho
[1:14:24] <%JEiddew> ggez is not banned in lol, lol

[1:14:39] <%mercado94> Blizzard said Im gay
[1:14:39] <Worldbrand> being employed is banned in overwatch
[1:14:43] <%UltraCasualBoom> I play OW without chat and it’s SO much more tolerable
[1:14:43] <%TheShal> Do you play underlook?
[1:14:43] <dragoon001914> Toxic is just so melodramatic to say. I remember when 'toxic' people were just called assholes.
[1:14:44] <$HarraceHarrison> The box!
[1:14:45] <%AncelDeLambert> liars, that was hard!
[1:14:46] <$Agami23> gg ez would get censored into reinhardt quotes on april fools
[1:14:48] <bigbradish> OW is full of toxic people I would know I dabble in toxicity
[1:14:51] <sdgundum990> the term toxic has meant nothing since it got overused in league of legends
[1:14:51] <+rooked4> GG is fine, but GGEZ is saying they were trash

[1:15:07] <%SergeantSov> "gg ez" is a handshake and a slap in the face at the same time

[1:15:09] <%JEiddew> ezpz is also banned
[1:15:10] <ItsRatman> i always say gg wp, because people are babies on the internet

[1:15:30] <+tigerfang86> @ThatGuyfromMars I appreciate how they keep trying to keep it fresh but I think this could go either way, because they way they're trying to push BUILD ALL YOUR UNITS FROM SCRATCH is not the way I want Fire Emblem to go
[1:15:31] <gustavozxd> people do it anyway and they spam it
[1:15:32] <Paradocks23> Hey! I play league and I can tell you that we are WAY more toxic than Overwatch.
[1:15:32] <%Raxus_Secundus> @mr_strut Because we are in a less civilized age
[1:15:33] <%jiin6> fun in gaming? oh thats toxic and requires a banning...
[1:15:36] <+rooked4> The EZ means, easy win, meaning they suck at the gam

[1:48:59] <NeutrinoInteraction> Paige just spends most of her time at the top of a waterfall, swinging a chain around.

[1:49:15] <nutimik> There's a small chance that the loading screen gives a tip about the current killer
[1:49:15] <%2Metronomes> Paige needs to go back for that key and look for the hatch
[1:49:21] <%jiin6> They sneak too?
[1:49:27] <%Ell1ot> Paige working on the machines relaxes me and i start falling asleep. then she gets scared and wakes me up

[1:49:38] <%TheFilth> I mean it would be pretty broken if you didn't, since she can have no horror radius if she's stalking
[1:49:40] <%AncelDeLambert> I wish the traps were easier to collect, they're so annoying to get where you want
[1:49:41] <%2Metronomes> @jiin6 Amanda can sneeak

[1:51:14] <$Weeabooninja> Oh hey, it's CrymeTina
[1:51:15] <stiffybiro> my killer does 40 rods to the hogshead and that’s just the way i likes it
[1:51:17] <$joylent_blue> the headgear helps straighten your teeth :)
[1:51:19] <%AncelDeLambert> @tiishi it's the SAW reverse bear trap
[1:51:19] <Firesparks> this killer is a reference to SAW
[1:51:20] <+Kahnicus> Hooked on Phonics worked for her.
[1:51:30] <+ThatGuyfromMars> @TheTakkster it insta kills you after a while if you don't take it off
[1:51:30] <%wingblade7> are the masks timed?
[1:51:30] <%ThePuddingDead> how long does that last?
[1:51:31] <%krawtch> maybe dont charge headstrong into your own death
[1:51:34] <BayowolfTerra> Its aloss regardless
[1:51:37] <+rooked4> Wellly wellly welly, the key wouldnt have worked anyways, it only spawns with two gens done
[1:51:41] <TheTakkster> Yikes
[1:51:42] <sdgundum990> Can the killer destroy items in chests that havent been claimed?
[1:51:48] <%AncelDeLambert> The traps begin their timer once the final generator has been started
[1:51:57] <+rooked4> Hes gonna laugh at us D:
[1:52:02] <DuoScratch> Just any generator @AncelDeLambert

[2:40:50] <HefestoForges> elmo has the timing nailed down
[2:40:50] <%ThePuddingDead> Nerds are born in the lockers....Molded by them
[2:40:50] <Sinister_Aglet> elmo is introduction hard mode
[2:40:50] <+tiishi> baby wants momma
[2:40:50] <%IAmAkiva> PASS THE CONTROLLER BRO
[2:40:51] <ShichiNoBushi> I thought it was established in a previous stream that hiding in lockers is especially risky when against the Huntress.
[2:40:52] <+Kahnicus> Does.... does that hammer murderer have rabbit ears?
[2:40:52] <Valdorick> Elmo with the REAL blocking.
[2:40:54] <%jiin6> sipsipElmo Dad said its my turn on the mouse
[2:41:00] <+tiishi> the IRL body block
[2:41:00] <mr_slaide> HE SCREMS
[2:41:02] <$Corporate_Redeemer> Dwights were the most frequent survivors to find inside lockers, hence the term Locker Dwights
[2:41:08] <OwlLightningMage> Elmo hates throwing in fighting games LUL
[2:41:10] <%ThePuddingDead> Elmo likes watching u play

[2:41:23] <Aleate> The lord says let Elmo take the wheel BlessRNG apatElmo
[2:41:24] <%joylent_blue> remember that time Elmo made you die to Orphan of Kos
[2:41:26] <+Kahnicus> ELNO SCREM ON STREM
[2:41:27] <$HarraceHarrison> Dwights can exude their leadership musk from the safety of the locker
[2:41:27] <%tweedler92> it's Elmo's turn on the Xbox apatPorgmo
[2:41:29] <Kaitepaints> @corporate_redeemer I’m confused
[2:41:29] <%SilentEric> Back when the game came out and there was 4 survivors, Dwight's lack of personal survival in his kit meant he got that reputation for cowardice to survive. @PeachSaliva
[2:41:32] <@StridentSong> @peachsaliva Back before the DLC's, there was certain behaviors the originals survivors would do. You'd have Locker Dwights, who would hide in lockers, Sabo Jakes who would sabotage everyting, and Distraction Megs, because they'd use Sprint Burst to distract the killer
[2:41:37] <lloyddboy> SCREMLO
[2:41:39] <%joylent_blue> Elmo loves sabotage
[2:41:40] <BayowolfTerra> go the other way?
[2:41:41] <emillionghost> why do u walk toward the killer?
[2:41:44] <Kaitepaints> Ooooooooooooh

[2:41:59] <%jiin6> sipsipElmo *screams in elmo*
[2:42:01] <+HRDSalami654> Emlo!
[2:42:07] <@StridentSong> Then they nerfed sabo into the ground, and Jake stopped being played as much
[2:42:09] <%QueequegTheater> Plague doesn't lewd things, he improves their physiques
[2:42:12] <%starotter70> I hope Pat's just staring at the ceiling in his bed, listening to all of Paige's shouting
[2:42:13] <BayowolfTerra> it's cuz she's above you.
[2:42:17] <SulfurousAcid> remember terror radius goes up and down too
[2:42:20] <%wingblade7> @wheke_ please dont pervert beast wars, there's more potential for lewd beast machines
[2:42:26] <%TheFilth> @StridentSong that was around the time I stopped playing
[2:42:35] <Zaphire_Saucypants> Fill us with your art cum, Plague.

[2:43:01] <+ThatGuyfromMars> @wingblade7 you make it sound like there isn't already porn of it
[2:43:05] <SeventyForce> Articus Cuminium Bukake
[2:43:10] <SulfurousAcid> Meg love noise
[2:43:10] <+rooked4> Paige, the trick is that the walls that are blocked by a door has a gen next to it that will open the wall once finished. If the wlal is already open, then theres no gen near by
[2:43:10] <@StridentSong> Around then is when I ended up getting Rank 1 Trapper, since jakes weren't fucking breaking my traps all the time. Then I stopped playing for a bit
[2:43:13] <%IAmAkiva> take a nap
[2:43:15] <%wingblade7> i dont need to know about the porn

[2:47:19] <%ThePuddingDead> lets watch the chat yall
[2:47:21] <$Corporate_Redeemer> Dwights tend to hide inside closest the most out of all the playable Survivors so people started joking that all Dwight mains hide in lockers. Kinda like how all Meg mains are chickens that run away at the slight heartbeat of a killer and Claudette mains being the most toxic and hard to see Survivors due their skin color and dark clothing making them LITERALLY impossible to see on certain areas of the map (not being racist, they literally disappear in pitch black areas).
[2:47:21] <BayowolfTerra> prepare for toxicity

[2:55:04] <CptBritches> HOT
[2:55:05] <Bouldus> always be mean to Pat Kappa
[2:55:05] <StalwartZephyr> Who fucking litters
[2:55:11] <%SuichiTanaka> Pat has massive resists to shame
[2:55:12] <%Keyd00d> BIGGER
[2:55:14] <%Skeletorexplains> WHAT?
[2:55:15] <Endocrom> Trouble is he HAS no shame
[2:55:17] <Fujiwara_92> he can't be shamed
[2:55:17] <%Nobrev> well littering is well and truly vile
[2:55:22] <%Spydurman> @PeachSaliva think if he was born on Christmas he'd hate Santa instead of the Earth?
[2:55:24] <OwlLightningMage> That and all the Red Bull
[2:55:24] <%joylent_blue> he is impervious to shame
[2:55:26] <%starotter70> I like the idea that the main goal in these streams is to slowly drive Pat insane through his OCD
[2:55:28] <%bloodypurpledog> Pat is singlehandedly destroying the ozone
[2:55:30] <nobknee> His "one true vice." Not like the closet chocolate. Kappa
[2:55:33] <%Breakfast_Megapowers> Isn't Pat the same guy that looks at the PERFECT dictatorship of Mirrors Edge and wants to live in it?
[2:55:33] <%joylent_blue> unless it is pant-shitting related
[2:55:34] <aimlesshealer> Someone sic that anti-litter motorcycle vigilante on Pat
[2:55:39] <HefestoForges> SECRET CANDY THO
[2:55:42] <OwlLightningMage> I forgot about closet chocolate LUL
[2:55:43] <nepwar> one day hes gonna step on some nasty litter and he'll find out its HIS litter
[2:55:45] <dashmatt> redbull too
[2:55:47] <+kiiiirsten> Me hungry now....
[2:55:49] <%Sphincter_Spelunker> Paige talking about vices as she eats fast food borger
[2:55:50] <+korth367> waow bitch
[2:55:54] <TheBlankAce> Pat's attempt to become a cartoon character will not be thwarted
[2:55:56] <%SuichiTanaka> Pat's perfection OCD is exactly WHY he gets so much catharsis from littering
[2:55:57] <KaptainKappathe5th> that argument between you and pat a couple days ago was the funniest thing ive ever seen on twitch
[2:56:02] <+Kahnicus> Ah, salad is gone, time now for fruit and meat.
[2:56:10] <+BlackJack607> And pat got me hooked on hard drugs.
[2:56:12] <RichAnvils> RIP that guys free time
[2:56:13] <%Breakfast_Megapowers> FF14 and DBD is a weird mix
[2:56:17] <+kiiiirsten> I hate the way you rip apart the burger with your hands like an animal before you take a bite, yet I am compelled by it as well
[2:56:29] <%NWR_James> "Smoke crack" - Patrick Boivin
[2:56:31] <BayowolfTerra> I still love the idea that a bunch people came to see Apex legends and got litter arguments.
[2:56:36] <+Toast_Master_General> Why the giant piece of wood on the sofa?
[2:56:45] <+kiiiirsten> @Toast_Master_General Keeps pat in line
[2:56:50] <%CyborgAV> Last Year stream when?
[2:56:55] <OwlLightningMage> We can't forgot that Pat told us how to smother our children during the Dead P LP
[2:56:57] <%Breakfast_Megapowers> @Toast_Master_General Why not?
[2:56:59] <%joylent_blue> its pat's giant popsicle stick
[2:57:04] <Zaphire_Saucypants> It's the abuse stick.
[2:57:05] <Valdorick> @SuichiTanaka No no, see, by littering outside, he's cleansing his soul. The garbage is out there, in someone else land, and that evil is theirs now. But his house? His -soul-? Its clean. There's less garbage in it.
[2:57:15] <ShichiNoBushi> Sloppy make-outs with L4D.
[2:57:18] <+Toast_Master_General> @kiiiirsten Ah makes sense
[2:57:19] <%Sphincter_Spelunker> That game title does not help phrasing
[2:57:19] <+Kahnicus> @Toast_Master_General May be for killing spiders, may be for telling the upstairs neighbord to fuck more quietly.
[2:57:22] <nobknee> @PeachSaliva Happy Valentine's Day, if you're into the holiday. May you and Pat have a fun one. Use lube!

[3:05:04] <Valdorick> The larger question at work here is - If a male cannibal grounds up your body, then it includes your dick - would eating the you slurry be gay?
[3:05:10] <+thebonebard> is sucking dick gay purely if you are dehydrating
[3:05:11] <nepwar> do zombie do it for pleasure or neccesity
[3:05:14] <lloyddboy> woo
[3:05:14] <+Kahnicus> The zombies smart enough to streetfight in Return of the Living Dead: Necropolis!
[3:05:17] <Bouldus> day of the dead arent zombies though, they have a "rage virus" so hyper rabies
[3:05:21] <%Breakfast_Megapowers> what if a Gay person turns into the Zombo and starts eating out someone of the opposite gender?

[3:40:02] <Kaitepaints> @salty_syd913 science is scary. I remember once I was in a biology class in college and we were learning about DNA and sometimes it just jumps around usually causing diseases.

[3:43:49] <Caidezes> Full Body has a super easy mode.
[3:43:49] <BeeNoons> thinking is hard for pat
[3:43:50] <person181> paige it WOULD BE THE WORST IT WILL EVER BE
[3:43:50] <DracaenaLeaf> you will be sucked
[3:43:50] <Sinister_Aglet> it has a new easy mode where you cannot die
[3:43:50] <$AgentTexes> @ThatGuyfromMars I got a ASUS ROG GL703 and when it plays games it gets pretty got because of the shitty design. I regret the purchase and don't recommend it. Had to undervolt and force the turbo off to keep it at respectable heat levels. It's loud as shit but it's definitely better than the two shitty laptops it replaced.
[3:43:52] <%cirilionaire> depends on what atlus's rules on streaming it are too
[3:43:54] <Worldbrand> I believe in brute smarts
[3:43:55] <zamzoph> SHADOOOOW PUZZLESSSSSS
[3:43:55] <$TeraMercier> It is pretty tough in the puzzles even on very easy
[3:43:57] <hntronium> Just stream it with Woolie
[3:43:57] <LixFury> make woolie do it
[3:43:59] <%ThePuddingDead> You could maybe do it for Halloween

[3:44:12] <BeeNoons> sfhGIFT
[3:44:16] <$TeraMercier> Wait until you can use a fully completed save to skip all the puzzles maybe?
[3:44:17] <TheBlankAce> Catherine has a mode equivalent to safety in the persona games so you'll be fine
[3:44:17] <aimlesshealer> It was a just flex
[3:44:19] <waifoong98> Pat dying live on stream because of Sherry puzzle doubt he can strea mthis LUL
[3:44:20] <+ThatGuyfromMars> @AgentTexes I have an old dell that serves me well

[3:44:24] <ScreamingMeat> I would gladly go full Ghost in the Shell with my cyberization
[3:44:28] <st4rrytea> oh yeah that would be difficult and a long stream
[3:44:30] <RollCritFail> Even Woolie has a hard time with the puzzles in Catherine
[3:44:34] <Smaenus> I do the same thing, feelsbad
[3:44:40] <kascadekitty_7> Climb up stupid
[3:44:42] <%joylent_blue> nah that one guy was a dick
[3:44:44] <$TeraMercier> @TheBlankAce There's no setting that makes the puzzles any easier, just stops punishing you harshly for failing
[3:44:46] <aimlesshealer> It was totally rude
[3:44:49] <zamzoph> but he would be right in most cases
[3:44:49] <Worldbrand> im with paige on this one
[3:44:49] <%Skeletorexplains> MrDestructoid Ha-ha
[3:44:55] <+Kise77> They should have been prepared for a flex
[3:44:55] <%ThePuddingDead> rude's gonna rude
[3:44:55] <DandyMackeroos> It's okay my life is mostly not so well thought out either.

[3:55:09] <grayjammer> Furry 2B
[3:55:10] <%joylent_blue> and another 2B
[3:55:14] <DandyMackeroos> So it's tame
[3:55:14] <%UltraCasualBoom> Dogtails! Woohoo!!!
[3:55:18] <DandyMackeroos> Hum
[3:55:23] <+Kahnicus> (((Normal)))?
[3:55:24] <Kaitepaints> And 4B
[3:55:26] <FlameLoneWolf> Normal is overrated
[3:55:35] <nepwar> 2B and 2B but chocolate
[3:55:36] <Kaitepaints> And DD
[3:55:46] <Endocrom> We need to get rid of time zones, like China
[3:55:51] <+lethallunacyx> no fanfic sonic the hedgehog?
[3:55:55] <nobknee> Furries don't bother me so much, but fursuits are never cool to me. They just never look good. It's like bangin' a mascot. Suppose it's the best they can do at the moment.
[3:56:02] <$KnivesEve> choco 2B is 2P
[3:56:02] <+ThatGuyfromMars> I know Violent J and his daughter are into that stuff
[3:56:06] <%ThePuddingDead> two weeks aint shit, u got it
[3:56:20] <%clifin> I SAID STUPID @PeachSaliva NO GOOD ADVICE
[3:56:27] <$Agami23> 2P is amazing.
[3:56:31] <waifoong98> GG, now you made the person worried Paige Kappa
[3:56:32] <DandyMackeroos> @kniveseve That 2P is pretty strong
[3:56:34] <chambatron> Do you checkyour pocket to see if Pat
[3:56:35] <$TeraMercier> Catherine doesn't have a skip puzzle button, and the whole game is puzzles. It's literally anti-Paige. And it's on a time limit so Paige'll probably explode
[3:56:38] <chambatron> s there?
[3:56:41] <+ThatGuyfromMars> senpai noticed you @ThePuddingDead
[3:56:50] <%ThePuddingDead> that she did
[3:56:54] <+MrComics> I've got a smaller move but still the biggest Ive done, super stressed but just chip away at it
[3:56:54] <%joylent_blue> she says
[3:57:09] <%clifin> @ThePuddingDead thanks, buddy
[3:57:12] <aimlesshealer> I love the FF4 streams
[3:57:15] <derap41> Has Pat taken you to Red Lobster yet or are you still young
[3:57:16] <Dakuu75> does the stream keep stalling/pausing for a second? (or that's just me)
[3:57:20] <+Kahnicus> Run around, say shitballs god dammit in my ass, casual night.
[3:57:21] <$TeraMercier> Paige likes to be the architect of her own stress
[3:57:27] <emillionghost> awww
[3:57:31] <%joylent_blue> Dakuu75 its smooth to me
[3:57:34] <$Agami23> the FF4 streams actually helped me keep my sanity during a hurricane evacuation.
[3:57:34] <rosemon5001> valentines day?soo i got to kali maaah people right?
[3:57:35] <DandyMackeroos> Remember when fanfiction overtook an FF4 stream?
[3:57:38] <ECRead> LUL
[3:57:38] <%salty_syd913> no shut up

[3:57:46] <aimlesshealer> Oh yes.

[3:57:50] <%ThePuddingDead> @clifin Not problem, keep your mind occupied getting your belongings and stuff getting sorted and you should be fine, and don't burn bridges
[3:57:50] <SchroedingersFerret> Last year, before the dark times

[3:58:46] <%UltraCasualBoom> A redheard wearing a blue shirt? You nuts?
