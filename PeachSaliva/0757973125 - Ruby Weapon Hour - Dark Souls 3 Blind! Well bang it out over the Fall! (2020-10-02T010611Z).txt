[0:48:01] <%QueequegTheater> That's wrong, there's only Dex builds in this game
[0:48:04] <Finakala> Imagine thinking DS1 is better when the second half of the game exists
[0:48:04] <OperatorJo_> G E N S H I N
[0:48:07] <+SaltyTheRower> str build for big and strong paige
[0:48:07] <%MoonObscure> genshin is good.

[0:48:10] <+RealThiele> Anri luk build
[0:48:10] <clempstwitch> man Genshin Impact is some fun shit
[0:48:12] <Bigyanno> DS1 has more potential builds but DS3 builds are much much easier to actually build
[0:48:21] <%QueequegTheater> DS3 isn't as deep or complex as any of the other games
[0:48:21] <%BeefMcCat> I WANTED TO
[0:48:21] <+Fooguwu> Paige would do better with a dex build to make it more like bloodborne. Strength isn't gonna work for her like in games with real poise

[1:38:34] <KaiserMario> Yeah LUL I feels MUCH BETTER
[1:38:35] <+trustycoyote> Mechanically it feels better
[1:38:38] <%BoxNavy> THE GRAFFICKS 🤓
[1:38:42] <the_Graboid> Did she secretly practice?
[1:38:45] <%TheFilth> did Pat burn himself there?
[1:38:47] <dabeaminator> Orbs have to be very high poly
[1:38:47] <$drabberfaun535> psaCrazyhand psaCrazyhead
[1:38:48] <%MyNameIsRasus> Besides Sekiro
[1:38:49] <%Lion_kun> and sekiro
[1:38:50] <%sleepers1mulant> DS3 really is better
[1:38:50] <Jrocy247> Sekiro is the newest game
[1:38:51] <%Sphincter_Spelunker> who
[1:38:54] <londorpaleale> You only need a voodoo to run pat.
[1:38:55] <SirKeigan> No fuck that
[1:38:55] <%BoxNavy> who is that?
[1:38:56] <Bigyanno> DS3 can look a little grubby at times but that's just an aesthetic thing
[1:38:59] <%SirGO0SE> i forgot :)
[1:38:59] <dots4eyes> Secure-O
[1:38:59] <SirKeigan> Weebu nonsense
[1:39:00] <Melchior_the_Wise> are we doing Demon's Souls remasterd pat?
[1:39:01] <%BinaryFireball> did paige play sekiro?
[1:39:01] <Zayasu> sekiro looks worse
[1:39:02] <+AmanisHouseOfNonsense> Da gwaphics, uWu
[1:39:04] <%Hick12> The graphics are good, but the colour pallet is very grey throughout the game.
[1:39:04] <danknugglit> Sekiro is v pretty
[1:39:04] <wibbwobbler> dlc is nice 2
[1:39:05] <%noctambulant00> id like to forget Sekiro
[1:39:05] <sniffy77> sekiro: play game twice
[1:39:06] <Zineta> sfhKEK
[1:39:07] <benjiFG> can't wait for paige's no damage 100% sekiro speedrun
[1:39:07] <Kalcom> I will forget sekiro thank you
[1:39:09] <Broand> Shapiro, Shadows die twice
[1:39:12] <+TopTieramisu> did you say sekiro looks worse than ds3?
[1:39:12] <T_Sasquatch> maybe we should forget sekiro
[1:39:15] <Reanimator83> Fuck that game
[1:39:15] <%SMuffinMan> Sekiro isn't Soulsborne
[1:39:15] <+Order_of_Mystery> just you wait till you see castle superbeast!
[1:39:16] <Admiral_PopnFresh> preparing is for smart people Kappa
[1:39:18] <garbageheaphound> WE NEVER ASSUMED
[1:39:21] <%BoxNavy> if paige practiced she would instantly forget the moment she went live
[1:39:22] <garbageheaphound> WE KNOW BETTER
[1:39:24] <+MisterAvry> somebody come get her, she killing crystal lizards
[1:39:27] <NireFuster> @BinaryFireball I don't think so
[1:39:28] <Bigyanno> It's towards the MASSIVE BEAMS OF LIGHT
[1:39:28] <ergulor> woohoo this saturday is going to be great
[1:39:30] <islandsunn> sekiro best from soft game
[1:39:31] <jmepik> soulsborkiro
[1:39:34] <+OwlLightningMage> Crazy Talk hypw
[1:39:35] <$joylent_blue> healing pvpHmm
[1:39:38] <%Deadmanslegacy> adios
[1:39:39] <NireFuster> Woah nice block
[1:39:40] <%noctambulant00> Never have I played a game that asks so much of the player and rewards basically nothing like Sekiro.
[1:39:43] <+MrAtheGreat> yooo its the mustard queen
[1:39:47] <@commanderclaw> Paige is doing way better with this game, I guess the Bloodborne feel makes her brain work
[1:39:52] <+TopTieramisu> sekiro is the prettiest game fromsoft has made. not including demon's souls remake
[1:39:52] <penitentpentwitch> Oh right, the weirdness of the "Luck Stat" and "Free Estus" in this game
[1:39:53] <buddhistmetal> the timing is so not worth it imo
[1:39:56] <%SvenHolgersson> WHIP THOSE BALLS OUT DUDE
[1:39:59] <%SvenHolgersson> LET EM SWAY
[1:39:59] <+trustycoyote> @SMuffinMan Thank you! I felt the same way but everyone says otherwise
[1:40:01] <+adolphinwizard> "No need to parry" Gets invaded by ***
[1:40:03] <islandsunn> sekiro rewards you with coolness
[1:40:04] <%MyNameIsRasus> "Parry, riposte; you are toast"
[1:40:04] <Bigyanno> Parry is just to show how large your penis is
[1:40:05] <whitebatsy> Parry Gundyr
[1:40:07] <TurtlesAndTentacles> she beat that crystal thing? damn
[1:40:08] <%TheFilth> ahh is hating Sekiro the new hot take
[1:40:08] <dabeaminator> Guys, she's in the first room, calm down.
[1:40:10] <%Sphincter_Spelunker> fromsoft isn't making the DeS remake
[1:40:10] <Admiral_PopnFresh> sure, that's why
[1:40:11] <+OwlLightningMage> Big need a certain Champion boss
[1:40:11] <KellBeII> is paige playing online?
[1:40:11] <%SegaDSi> @PeachSaliva you might want to put on the HUD
[1:40:11] <%BoxNavy> im the same way honestly. fuck ds1 and 2
[1:40:12] <TimesApex> The bloodborne feel make EVERYTHING better for everyone
[1:40:16] <@commanderclaw> Paige's balls are always out every stream
[1:40:16] <Melchior_the_Wise> She has biggest Penis
[1:40:19] <%SvenHolgersson> Sekiro is the most out there Fromsoft game to me
[1:40:19] <%Gatzarlok> Will this over confidence lead to her ruin with the first boss?
[1:40:20] <kindashagg> Paige digs high-speed violence
[1:40:20] <%tigerfang86> the HEART PENIS?>??
[1:40:21] <+MisterAvry> heart penis big
[1:40:21] <%BoxNavy> the cockballs
[1:40:21] <+VvTacoSaladvV> Dark Souls 2 feels like they deliberately made the game sluggish, as a joke.
[1:40:22] <PrettyThickandStrongDyck> Penis in heart sounds terrible
[1:40:22] <%ssjklyco> Jump
[1:40:22] <NireFuster> @dabeaminator She's still doing pretty good
[1:40:22] <%SMuffinMan> It's a good game but it's not Soulsborne
[1:40:23] <danknugglit> Big pp energy
[1:40:23] <+other_badger> waow
[1:40:24] <@SoFarFetched> Look at these cackle of cockles
[1:40:24] <+JonWhoLovesFlatWomen> WHAT?
[1:40:25] <+adolphinwizard> I super thought she would walk off the edge
[1:40:25] <%waltzqueen> PENIS THAT LIVES IN MY HEART
[1:40:25] <Admiral_PopnFresh> "Penis that lives in my heart"
[1:40:26] <%MyNameIsRasus> Cockels heh
[1:40:27] <Panquake25> any bets on first try Gundyr?
[1:40:27] <%noctambulant00> I don think theres anything new about disliking Sekiro
[1:40:27] <%Graxdon> I tried a smidge of Sekiro and it seemed odd. Maybe I need more time in, I'unno. Don't have the money for it now though
[1:40:28] <$AzureGale> If you have a penis in your heart see a doctor IMMEDIATELY
[1:40:30] <+chiazam> Oh I thought she was going to fall off
[1:40:30] <%juxtest> Other Souls games are just too slow for her Ultra Fast Genius Brain
[1:40:31] <%SvenHolgersson> As in it doesn't prepare you for it from other titles
[1:40:32] <$joylent_blue> LUL
[1:40:32] <+NeonBleu> i thought she was gonna fall off LUL
[1:40:33] <%sleepers1mulant> is that THE castle?
[1:40:33] <EuropanLamprey> Keep talking shit, the game will make sure you get hit
[1:40:34] <%Typhaeon> Is that Anor Londo, Pat
[1:40:35] <SGrim> "The penis that lives in my Heart," PeachSaliva 2020
[1:40:35] <+trustycoyote> @PeachSaliva Are you offline?
[1:40:35] <+MrAtheGreat> nut is her penis bigger than Elmo?
[1:40:35] <+Order_of_Mystery> you guys should do bloodborne again...
[1:40:39] <+GinAndRoses> it's pretty big i guess
[1:40:39] <%Starotter70> Press O
[1:40:39] <NireFuster> BONFIRE
[1:40:39] <Zineta> What a castle!
[1:40:40] <Melchior_the_Wise> ANOR LONDO
[1:40:40] <kylecoolperson> Medium Shields are bad for parrying.
[1:40:40] <dots4eyes> That's no Castle Super Beast tho
[1:40:41] <Bigyanno> See that castle? You can climb it
[1:40:41] <+patriotrenegade> thats MY castle
[1:40:41] <%MyNameIsRasus> IS THAT ANOR LONDO
[1:40:41] <@commanderclaw> This game is so pretty
[1:40:43] <s1rcuit> @TheFilth I liked it more than Dark Souls by a large margin
[1:40:43] <buddhistmetal> thought she was gonna fall
[1:40:44] <Coystick> Is that Castle Londo?
[1:40:45] <+chiazam> Fall off?
[1:40:49] <%SMuffinMan> I like it but Sekiro isn't Soulsborne
[1:40:49] <Redmannasah> Sekiro has a bunch of great stuff, dont be lame chat
[1:40:50] <%CantWalkGood> Play with the VR Mod!!!
[1:40:52] <+Standard_Enemy> I can't wait for Paige to beat sekiro in 1 sitting without ever dying a single time
[1:40:53] <Jrocy247> The Geography makes no sense in this game, but it's WAAAAY better than DS2's
[1:40:53] <Sunstalker> A boner is jsut the heart trying to leave the body :)
[1:40:54] <TimesApex> This game is still so pretty

[1:41:26] <+shinji_ifrit> huh, I never noticed Lothric was there
[1:41:27] <+BoboDaHobo> Sekiro had a ton of great shit in it but it's the least interesting to return to
[1:41:28] <Bigyanno> Huh I never noticed the sword in the bonfire has a darksign-eqsue circle on it
[1:41:28] <SirKeigan> I haven't had a bloody nose in years

[1:41:36] <Melchior_the_Wise> Makes the blood Nose
[1:41:38] <%linSP> splort blood out your nose like an uguu
[1:41:40] <%Lunarhawk> I remember the time pat was the guy with the thing yeah haha
[1:41:40] <+other_badger> by anime move, do you mean psychic powers or sexual harassment?
[1:41:42] <danknugglit> LUL
[1:41:43] <Admiral_PopnFresh> if you get horny in anime you get a nose bleed
[1:41:44] <%Sphincter_Spelunker> @Graxdon The parry system in Sekiro is when it all comes together. You pretty much have to get used to every new enemy, then it flows like butter
[1:41:46] <$AzureGale> Pat is going to have lots of nose emergencies during the Genshin Impact stream tomorrow
[1:41:47] <Ookamiden02> makes your blood nose?
[1:41:48] <%MyNameIsRasus> @other_badger yes
[1:41:49] <cureneckbeard> abipopKIRAPANTSU
[1:41:54] <dabeaminator> Sekiro shouldn't be compared to these games just because it's by the same developer. It's practically in a completely different genre.
[1:41:54] <%waltzqueen> Pat that's a shitty bloodline technique
[1:41:55] <dots4eyes> Don't mind...Pat's just doing his blood majick
[1:41:57] <jeosadn> Bloodline technique: STAIN SHIRT
[1:41:57] <studleydoorite> @BoxNavy -2 jermaOld

[1:41:59] <Melchior_the_Wise> did pat have a stroke?
[1:42:00] <PlebianNoob> I thought that has when anime guys were horny

[1:48:20] <+a_c_chirns> DS2 feels bad to play
[1:48:20] <%SMuffinMan> 2 is butt
[1:48:20] <+wydamn> Paige doesn't even NEED the humbus!
[1:48:21] <fritz_dacat> He's not that bad of a Man
[1:48:21] <+adolphinwizard> Now go lose to the swordsman
[1:48:21] <hairtoday> she has escaped the cube!
[1:48:23] <%chvmpchange> 2 is a shit game
[1:48:23] <PanicSwytch> Amazing job Paige
[1:48:23] <+WhereIsWill> limiters REMOVED
[1:48:24] <TimesApex> She took the inhibitor bracelets off like SHADOW THE HEDGEHOG
[1:48:24] <%cylish> 2 plays bad
[1:48:24] <dots4eyes> Her limiters are off boys
[1:48:27] <Panquake25> the weights are off!
[1:48:28] <peyodogo> ds3 controls so much better tbh
[1:48:28] <dabeaminator> Fun Fact, my idiot brother got stuck on Gundyr and gave up on Dark Souls 3 entirely in his baby rage.
[1:48:28] <%TheFilth> you're fighting the game
[1:48:28] <$Solidnick18> 2 is slog
[1:48:29] <ciaranartorias> weeeelll, idex gundyr isn't a bad man, he's resigned to testing you, but sure

[1:48:35] <penitentpentwitch> 3 has much smoother gameplay
[1:48:35] <+MrAtheGreat> It's more reactive
[1:48:35] <+Pookiedaexzile> It Just Feels Good
[1:48:36] <%OddballEA> how did you die to rats 50 times but kill this guy one try?

[1:59:43] <OneThousandTomatoes> first fart ever
[1:59:46] <%BoxNavy> she saves the one and lets it rip before bed
[1:59:46] <islandsunn> BegWan
[1:59:47] <Smaenus> girls don't fart that's a myth
[1:59:49] <SirKeigan> Vigor is good so you don't die as fast
[1:59:50] <$Trenr> it's been 84 years
[1:59:51] <@commanderclaw> Paige has a single hypercompressed fart in her body. When she dies she will end the earth
[1:59:53] <PrettyThickandStrongDyck> his orb holds massive fart power
[1:59:53] <SirKeigan> vigor is great at 20
[1:59:57] <%Sphincter_Spelunker> woo Bloodborne Endurance build

[2:00:05] <the_Acumen> Looks like Paige is the Smelter.
[2:00:10] <+Invlux> I'm playing the Pocket Souls mod rn, it's fun but it needs balancing HARD
[2:00:11] <NireFuster> Paige the fart DELTER
[2:00:11] <Crimpson> Paige is pull of fiber
[2:00:12] <Kalcom> what weapon did she run in bloodborne?
[2:00:13] <@SoFarFetched> I would say 2 Vig,2 End,2 Strength.
[2:00:13] <SpaceGuntank> there is nothing wrong with the tried and true STR build
[2:00:14] <Huntercd> Dog farts
[2:00:15] <PrettyThickandStrongDyck> @commanderclaw it's like that one daxters lab episode
[2:00:16] <+Solid_Stro> Smelter Delter Paige
[2:00:18] <SirKeigan> @peachsaliva There's a glitch to respec indefinitely
[2:00:20] <+Dayube> imagine holding a fart in for 30+ years, that's paige
[2:00:22] <+OwlLightningMage> Building towards a weapon after finding it has always been terrible advice
[2:00:22] <$Solidnick18> Big guts swords
[2:00:23] <RushUnplugged> BIG STRONG
[2:00:25] <SirKeigan> Swords are good
[2:00:28] <benjiFG> not again please
[2:00:28] <%MyNameIsRasus> PAIGE IS THE DELTER
[2:00:28] <%g0atmeal> You only get 5 respecs
[2:00:29] <sosuke5> not really though
[2:00:31] <+patriotrenegade> quality
[2:00:33] <Bigyanno> I think the's going quality then
[2:00:34] <%Sphincter_Spelunker> @Kalcom Ludwig's sword, I think
[2:00:35] <%SvenHolgersson> BIG ENDURANCE
[2:00:36] <Hydrapissed> VIGOR is OP!
[2:00:36] <%Lion_kun> i'd pump some health
[2:00:37] <$Solidnick18> become guts Kreygasm
[2:00:38] <SirKeigan> Endurance so you can swing more
[2:00:38] <%SvenHolgersson> BIG STRENGTH
[2:00:39] <%noctambulant00> Honestly your playstyle is only good with STR

[2:00:41] <+patriotrenegade> QUALITY
[2:00:42] <OneThousandTomatoes> @commanderclaw isn't that the setting of death stranding?
[2:00:42] <Finakala> END is always good
[2:00:44] <$joylent_blue> g0atmeal with a glitch you can do it infinitely
[2:00:44] <$AzureGale> "Whatever I'm doing right now feels really good" lines that have probably been heard in bed
[2:00:45] <StalwartZephyr> Stamina is the real health bar
[2:00:49] <LoneFonte> @g0atmeal i mean, thats much better than 0
[2:00:54] <wibbwobbler> cool moves on different weapons
[2:00:54] <EuropanLamprey> You need Vig asaop
[2:00:54] <Animorphimagi> SHUT UP PAT
[2:00:55] <Bigyanno> You can respec like 5 times
[2:00:56] <SirKeigan> no that's like 1/4th in
[2:00:56] <+crimsonharvest> Vigor imo
[2:00:57] <+Solid_Stro> I like a good butt poker class doodDerp
[2:00:59] <+Sebenoth> i'll paige decide, except..
[2:01:00] <Smaenus> Quality build best build IMO, it's almost every weapon in the game
[2:01:00] <cureneckbeard> put luck up to 50
[2:01:02] <darylsleepshere> max stamina for max spam
[2:01:02] <Zineta> All in Luck Kappa
[2:01:03] <SirKeigan> it's a quarter of the way in, not as far as a third
[2:01:06] <Hydrapissed> tongue
[2:01:07] <Etherealizer> You can straight up just make your weapon Raw for the first 1/3 of the game and put all your points into Vigor/End
[2:01:09] <+adolphinwizard> A tongue
[2:01:09] <Admiral_PopnFresh> swing swing swing swing swing swing swing
[2:01:09] <%noctambulant00> Unless you get real good at dodging real fast, dont build too far in to DEX
[2:01:09] <%BoxNavy> uhhh
[2:01:11] <Finakala> You can only respec 5 times per NG cycle, AND it'll lock you out of a questline, AND it's in an optional area
[2:01:12] <Monkeyweed21> oh god pat is gonna be taking info from Cinders mod and being wrong
[2:01:14] <+OwlLightningMage> You can only repec five times with a pvp item
[2:01:14] <+adolphinwizard> You gotta rip out some tongues
[2:01:15] <Hydrapissed> 5 max

[2:01:18] <%averyoddjew> you can only respec 5 times a playthrough
[2:01:19] <%tigerfang86> but you can do it for free
[2:01:21] <+JenovasPuppet> IT'S FINE
[2:01:21] <peachy996> stop goldblumming pat
[2:01:23] <SirKeigan> THERE'S A GLITCH
[2:01:24] <+CaptainKarite> UNLESS you use the cloud
[2:01:25] <PrettyThickandStrongDyck> BUT UH
[2:01:25] <UlriktheSlayer1> but you can get them from the base game as rare drops
[2:01:26] <SirKeigan> TO RESPEC INFINITELY
[2:01:26] <PlatinumWyvern> do the tree skip and get the silver serpent ring
[2:01:27] <Smaenus> Better than zero!
[2:01:28] <$joylent_blue> @PeachSaliva you can respec infinitely with a glitch
[2:01:28] <StalwartZephyr> You can find some items in the game for free
[2:01:29] <+adolphinwizard> You can save scum
[2:01:30] <@commanderclaw> Paige is indecisive AF, this is known
[2:01:31] <SirKeigan> There's a respect glitch
[2:01:32] <jaydubbies> lol you def wont need 5 times
[2:01:33] <+crimsonharvest> you dont need to do it any
[2:01:34] <Paralurx> EZ BUT LIMITED
[2:01:34] <%Lion_kun> save scum
[2:01:34] <+JenovasPuppet> NOBODY NEEDS MORE THAN 5!
[2:01:34] <Hydrapissed> 5 is ENOUGH
[2:01:35] <Rozalyndis> you'll hafta make a decision on SOME things paige cmon
[2:01:35] <SirKeigan> You can do it infinitely
[2:01:37] <EuropanLamprey> You can use a bug to get infinite respec
[2:01:37] <$ItsRatman> You dont need all 5 of them lol
[2:01:37] <+OwlLightningMage> It's not easy
[2:01:37] <Lancaster_H> JUST GO QUALITY
[2:01:37] <%g0atmeal> there's also less need to respec in this game
[2:01:38] <@PlagueOfGripes> It's a terrible system
[2:01:38] <%AdmiralButtloaf> @PeachSaliva soul items can be sold to a vendor in this game instead of using one at a time
[2:01:38] <%noctambulant00> It is easy.... 5 times
[2:01:39] <+bhp_99> it is easy
[2:01:39] <%SvenHolgersson> ENDURANCE GOOD

[2:01:49] <Bigyanno> I don't think anyone has ever used all 5 respecs
[2:01:50] <%Graxdon> Gotta get that silver ring.
[2:01:50] <the_Graboid> STRENGTH
[2:01:50] <Cherokia666> If your build is good enough, you'd barely need to respec once
[2:01:52] <2fcd_twitch> You can do it infinitely
[2:01:52] <+Solid_Stro> lytWIPED
[2:01:57] <$ImasukyLomae> Put it all in luck
[2:01:58] <%Hick12> Don't count on respeccing because it screws up Sirrus's quest if you do it early.
[2:01:59] <Kalcom> sex dex
[2:01:59] <the_Acumen> WRONG. You can respec a limitless amount of times using the Rosaria glitch.
[2:02:00] <+OwlLightningMage> It's a terrible system. Plague is super right
[2:02:01] <%Agami23> paige, we all know what your build is gonna be. your gonna pump lots of strength
[2:02:02] <SirKeigan> Two levels maybe
[2:02:03] <Hydrapissed> she can sell souls to now

[2:02:05] <%Promessa_EX> Just play good
[2:02:07] <PlatinumWyvern> you can get the covenant item from darkwraiths to respec, don't need to pvp
[2:02:08] <CurrySauseBandit> Alright, who actually needed to respec 5 times outside of PvP builds?
[2:02:09] <SirKeigan> Sell souls to the lady now. It's quicker
[2:02:10] <Bigyanno> Cannot go wrong with health and stamina
[2:02:11] <%chvmpchange> Paige You can totally respec without doing any pvp

[2:04:28] <+NeonBleu> BloodBorne Paige is back
[2:04:28] <+logoth_> Dark Souls 2 was harder due to its crap factor
[2:04:28] <@SoFarFetched> Pat why did you suddenly become a couch.
[2:04:29] <+trustycoyote> it's 2020. I'll believe anything
[2:04:29] <%TigerCatGo> Is this the real Paige??
[2:04:29] <OneThousandTomatoes> She has become the hugest
[2:04:30] <@commanderclaw> Ask Paige a question only the real Paige would know
[2:04:30] <+NobleJedi> SHOW DOG
[2:04:30] <$ImasukyLomae> very
[2:04:31] <%Hick12> Lothric will test her.
[2:04:31] <AFlyingTaco1> Send her to the swordsman
[2:04:33] <%MechArch> is it a bit?
[2:04:33] <theloganbrand> She didn't really have a long break between games
[2:04:33] <+TheDullaMAN> You know she still missed those items, though.
[2:04:34] <+doc_ock_rokc> Pat did you cheat code for paige?
[2:04:34] <TuxedoNash> make her fight Mr. Uchi
[2:04:34] <$ItsRatman> It's okay she'll hit the wall at Pontiff like we all do.
[2:04:35] <%Promessa_EX> She’s hitting button
[2:04:35] <+WhereIsWill> let paige crush it ORB
[2:04:36] <Finakala> Iudex Gundyr is one of the easiest bosses in the whole franchise tho
[2:04:37] <+Finalknightmare> katana man can trip her up maybe?
[2:04:37] <Melchior_the_Wise> I just watched that Fuck Bees video, it's kind of amazing
[2:04:37] <Smaenus> Katanner man
[2:04:37] <+sixcubit> i heard she killed old iron king first try
[2:04:38] <penitentpentwitch> It's 100
[2:04:38] <simulationbard> Don't worry she'll start thinking about it and just fall apart
[2:04:39] <Drusain> The shield is 100%
[2:04:39] <%noctambulant00> Shes gonna have a bad time with a few bosses.
[2:04:40] <+Order_of_Mystery> think she'll defeat swordmaster?
[2:04:40] <%Sphincter_Spelunker> She'll meet a wall at some enemy and one shot hard bosses, like always
[2:04:42] <EuropanLamprey> Have her fight the Naked Uchiman
[2:04:42] <Lancaster_H> pat are you guys gonna skim over all the story and lore bits in this game like in DS2? @PeachSaliva
[2:04:42] <$ryome> Ds2 is just that bad
[2:04:42] <+Fooguwu> Won't she do better with DEX in this game because it's more like BB and no poise?
[2:04:43] <DavidSanChan> each new sub steals some pat butt and adds it to paiges
[2:04:44] <jorniev> HOW SOFT IS THAT DOG
[2:04:44] <%Skelegroove> Some of the bosses in this are gonna stop her
[2:04:44] <%luckybudman> playing by feel and instinct is good
[2:04:45] <islandsunn> this is paige's evil twin that's good at the vidya gams
[2:04:45] <+LouieRouie> Let Zangief play
[2:04:45] <penitentpentwitch> It's one of the best starting items
[2:04:47] <+doc_ock_rokc> Did they change it recently?
[2:04:47] <%averyoddjew> best starting shield
[2:04:48] <+Ultimate_Edge> Just ask and pvp will change that real quick.
[2:04:48] <@SoFarFetched> Pat did you start her offline?
[2:04:52] <+Dayube> CRAZY TALK
[2:04:53] <+Solid_Stro> How’s Genshin Impact Pat? You addicted?
[2:04:53] <+Sebenoth> the gameplay responds better to twitchy gameplay, not so much patience like in older titles
[2:04:54] <Zineta> we demand to see the dog or we riot pokemoRiot
[2:04:55] <2fcd_twitch> She has acsended!
[2:05:01] <+necrocannibal2> the Heater Shield is not in this game
[2:05:02] <%BinaryFireball> you got it???
[2:05:02] <+JonWhoLovesFlatWomen> mariaPup
[2:05:02] <%BoxNavy> congrats pats
[2:05:04] <%SilvaChariot0133> Over-under on him going off the cliff again?
[2:05:06] <%FacetiousAF> uchi man will humble her
[2:05:06] <Admiral_PopnFresh> you got the card, hooray
[2:05:06] <+AgniBrandt> I DO, PAT
[2:05:07] <%noctambulant00> Grats Pat
[2:05:07] <+chiazam> Congrats
[2:05:08] <+trustycoyote> Congrats on the new card, Pat!
[2:05:08] <xxshadowxx416> no luck paige
[2:05:08] <%SegaDSi> Like Ive seen alot of blind LPs 1 try or 2 try Gundyr so its not unexpected
[2:05:09] <Melchior_the_Wise> You heard about the Capacitor bullshit?
[2:05:09] <+KidsSeeGh0sts> you only got one, not 3
[2:05:10] <$joylent_blue> should she be offline? dolphinThunk
[2:05:10] <TimesApex> I chose a PS5 over GPU. DeS called too hard
[2:05:11] <$Solidnick18> it's alright
[2:05:12] <AFlyingTaco1> How much was it?
[2:05:13] <+necrocannibal2> I know it because I love the Heater Shield
[2:05:13] <+angel949> Show Dog or psaRaffle
[2:05:14] <%SvenHolgersson> IT FUN
[2:05:15] <+cgreene64> What if she plays like that the whole run and you actually finish it by the end of the fall? Kappa
[2:05:15] <+AgniBrandt> I know the fucking feeling it's so good
[2:05:16] <TuxedoNash> congratulation on card
[2:05:17] <+NobleJedi> I'm gonna wait for the 40 series
[2:05:19] <%BoxNavy> its fuckin rad
[2:05:19] <Nekros4442> You gotten a 5* yet?
[2:05:19] <+NecDW4> Pat better stream in 8k just because he can at least once
[2:05:20] <penitentpentwitch> Consider the card as karmic payment for all that happened in Spelunky 2
[2:05:20] <%ClericOfSparda> That Video card is nice. I still have a 1070 Ti
[2:05:21] <%Aleate> Now how can we get her to attack the Priestess to get the Dancer fight early? otzConcern
[2:05:21] <%BinaryFireball> 3090 or 3080?
[2:05:22] <Mr_Strut> Is Pat a whale now?
[2:05:22] <+logoth_> You ever check out Honkey Impact?
[2:05:22] <+TheCrispyBoi> howe get card
[2:05:23] <+OwlLightningMage> That happiness won't last
[2:05:23] <+chiazam> In time for CYBERPUNK CRUNCH 2077
[2:05:24] <$AzureGale> Just wait until you go on a wishing spree tomorrow
[2:05:25] <OneThousandTomatoes> it's free with gacha
[2:05:26] <PlatinumWyvern> do tree skip for ring and estus shard
[2:05:26] <+AgniBrandt> 3080.
[2:05:27] <+deviljhojho_> im not playing genshin impact until they add a horrifying pig monster i can play as so i can self insert
[2:05:27] <+AmanisHouseOfNonsense> Pat, what are the odds of Dickbutt getting into Smash?
[2:05:27] <sophienatorz_unite> have you secretly opened a waifu box yet?
[2:05:29] <$Fenlig> 2080 ti to a 3080 isn't such a jump though
[2:05:29] <+TheDullaMAN> Who've you got, Pat?
[2:05:30] <Admiral_PopnFresh> Ok, so it's good? BECAUSE I CAN'T TELL
[2:05:30] <+doc_ock_rokc> Hey Pat I got a job today but I might not make enough money to resub until next month
[2:05:31] <+nicoleymcquack> I hate to say that gundyr took me like 5 tries
[2:05:31] <+trustycoyote> @BinaryFireball 3080
[2:05:31] <+WhereIsWill> whos gonna do DES pat?
[2:05:33] <EuropanLamprey> Naked Uchiman is real first boss
[2:05:33] <Personified134> Did you know Genshin Impact revoked all of Hololives streaming rights because Coco said Taiwan?
[2:05:37] <ammobasket> PROUD OF HER
[2:05:38] <+angel949> Then the DlC
[2:05:39] <@commanderclaw> Then she's not real Paige, she's a doppelganger
[2:05:39] <tylerpyre> cybercrunch 2077
[2:05:40] <+AgniBrandt> 10-15% actually, but still
[2:05:40] <%Sphincter_Spelunker> number go up
[2:05:41] <TimesApex> 3090 is super disappointing
[2:05:41] <%BinaryFireball> where did you get it?
[2:05:41] <+adolphinwizard> 16% but still dumb
[2:05:42] <Personified134> Coco's name is a banned phrase in the game
[2:05:43] <JaceDarkstar> pat... pet the pupper pls
[2:05:43] <%Lunarhawk> DS2 DLC is always waiting for after she finishes DS3
[2:05:43] <DXLelouch24> Pat did you see the 1.1 leaks, you might spend money afterall
[2:05:43] <AFlyingTaco1> No wait, what do you think of Paimon, Pat? Yea or nay?
[2:05:43] <TuxedoNash> the card put all its points in endurance
[2:05:44] <%Promessa_EX> I like the voices in jp good mista ice boi
[2:05:44] <scrumbotime> But its so big tho!
[2:05:44] <+strifexfair> where'd you snag one Pat?
[2:05:44] <+Fooguwu> Won't Paige do better with a DEX or quality weapon since poise isn't real and strength is less like BB?
[2:05:45] <twistedj3ster> but number
[2:05:45] <Finakala> If she's doing the DLC's as well, Friede will still fuck her up
[2:05:46] <%SegaDSi> Then Mod it up
[2:05:46] <mathbertoldo> Do you think her being good takes away the appeal of watching a DS let's play?
[2:05:47] <Melchior_the_Wise> Much better for Video editing though
[2:05:48] <+NeonBleu> 10% for 200% price
[2:05:48] <+Dives__> 3090 is for professionals who need a shitload of VRAM
[2:05:49] <%noctambulant00> 3090 is a cash grab
[2:05:49] <Sunstalker> but number go big
[2:05:51] <xxshadowxx416> but 4%
[2:05:53] <+Bail_seven> BUT IT BIG
[2:05:53] <$NitronStreams> 3090 is for workstations
[2:05:54] <Mr_Strut> But it's faster tho
[2:05:58] <%vaderxyz1970> But the FLEX though....
[2:05:59] <%luckybudman> paige is good at switching between offense and defense
[2:06:03] <@SoFarFetched> @WhereIsWill he's gonna play DES,which is why she's doing DS3 instead of old Demon Souls. Since he's gonna play DES when it comes out on PS5.
[2:06:03] <+DeadlyPeaks> Bloodborne was my 1st souls & I had an easier time with ds3 than 1 & 2 too
[2:06:05] <+SPplayer> You should try and get to to make her weapon Raw so she can continue pumping Health and Stamina until she finds a weapon she likes
[2:06:06] <$Fenlig> you gonna build a PC for pagie with the 2080?
[2:06:08] <mistermastergreg> but number small
[2:06:11] <penitentpentwitch> Super Armor
[2:06:11] <wibbwobbler> 3090 just 2 flex
[2:06:15] <%king_wragles> @PeachSaliva if you had to choose, and didn't have any job needs, would you choose a 3080 over a PS5?
[2:06:15] <%Sphincter_Spelunker> She did a quality build in Bloodborne, did great there
[2:06:17] <Kalcom> that's not poise
[2:06:17] <Admiral_PopnFresh> big weapons have more poise, its true
[2:06:17] <%BinaryFireball> damn I just want card
[2:06:18] <%Lion_kun> they killed poise
[2:06:18] <+demon1103> if she plays like this whole time and finishes by fall we run for bomb shelter
[2:06:19] <@PlagueOfGripes> a shit part
[2:06:20] <Shion963> poise for super armor on moves instead
[2:06:20] <copicmario> It will be like if Berserk ended
[2:06:21] <$joylent_blue> she's just gonna face tank shit anyway
[2:06:22] <Melchior_the_Wise> DUAL 3090s PAT
[2:06:22] <SirKeigan> @PeachSaliva I say go all in on Vigor and Endurance until you find weapons or armor you want to wield. Weapon upgrades give more than stat upgrades
[2:06:22] <TimesApex> You're on PC; just turn it on lol
[2:06:23] <+OwlLightningMage> That was changed Pat
[2:06:23] <Rozalyndis> profane greatsword yea
[2:06:25] <islandsunn> hyper armor
[2:06:25] <Finakala> Quality works well in this game tbh
[2:06:26] <Kalcom> that's hyper armor
[2:06:27] <+OwlLightningMage> That's wrong
[2:06:30] <+WhereIsWill> @SoFarFetched nice!
[2:06:30] <%noctambulant00> Her playstyle is only really good with STR
[2:06:30] <Perky_LKM> They changed it after Ashes came out to be kinda usefull, but still not worth building.
[2:06:32] <Drusain> Paige prefers horizontal swings anyway
[2:06:32] <+Fooguwu> 2 frames of poise will make paige unstoppable
[2:06:33] <sosuke5> 3
[2:06:34] <@SoFarFetched> @Rozalyndis Hello Roz!
[2:06:34] <stabbityrabbit> Can I just say that Genshin Impact not giving you a claymore user for free is some hot bullshit. Claymore are goddamn mandatory for certain parts of the game.
[2:06:34] <+angel949> Poise isn't real, It can't hurt me
[2:06:35] <+Sebenoth> yeah, poise makes it harder to get broken out of some swing animations, thats about it
[2:06:35] <+G_Thunders> Enemies have normal poise for some reason
[2:06:36] <@PlagueOfGripes> this advice won't end well
[2:06:38] <EuropanLamprey> Poise only matters on Huge weapons so Full Havels Chaos Hornit Dagger fucks can get fucked
[2:06:39] <%tigerfang86> PRANKED
[2:06:41] <$NitronStreams> Nvidia saying the 3090 is for 8K gaming was a super stupid move
[2:06:42] <%tigerfang86> ITS A LADY
[2:06:44] <%BoxNavy> ashen one jermaOld
[2:06:48] <+patriotrenegade> @PeachSaliva Three

[2:06:58] <maxpasta> Is that lady paige
[2:07:00] <%SvenHolgersson> Enjoy this and one more character
[2:07:00] <+OwlLightningMage> They changed poise so that you need more of it to get it to work with the weapon at all
[2:07:02] <%AncelDeLambert> different lady, same class
[2:07:04] <%SvenHolgersson> Its all the DS2 you get
[2:07:05] <$joylent_blue> clang, clang, clang

[2:07:23] <+Order_of_Mystery> who's laughing now you old bitch?
[2:07:24] <%FacetiousAF> andreeeeee

[2:07:33] <TimesApex> How has he lived THIS LONG
[2:07:33] <+G_Thunders> The DLC has an entire zone from
[2:07:35] <%tigerfang86> ITS HIM
[2:07:35] <%Lion_kun> so much better than Leningrast
[2:07:36] <Perky_LKM> Before like 1.08 you only needed like 5 poise to tank a blow from anything.
[2:07:36] <%Rumbutt> There are lots of DS2 refs
[2:07:37] <+BigDumBeak> andre smithing, very very fast
[2:07:37] <%waltzqueen> MOTUH MOVING

[2:07:48] <+WhereIsWill> cuz hes a BOSS
[2:07:48] <koffeemancer> His mouth moves. Weird
[2:07:48] <+Fooguwu> He stays alive because he always has a purpose
[2:07:48] <%Skelegroove> Don't think about it
[2:07:50] <+patriotrenegade> TIME IS CONVOLUTED
[2:07:50] <dots4eyes> Andre is still going further beyond
[2:07:51] <%Gatzarlok> He's undead and he NEVER loses his reason to live
[2:07:51] <$Solidnick18> YEAH
[2:07:52] <%TheFilth> no time to die when there's smithing to be done
[2:07:52] <%Lion_kun> paige, set your estus to all orange
[2:07:52] <+Jaysky> Aren't the blacksmiths immortal?
[2:07:53] <EuropanLamprey> Andre is too busy smithing to age

[2:08:01] <SilverFaustX> and the son of gywn
[2:08:03] <%Agami23> i like to think he is undead and just focused really hard on making swords
[2:08:05] <Darren716> Always allot to health
[2:08:06] <OneThousandTomatoes> to busy smithing to go hollow
[2:08:06] <%Nox_ludicro> Undead live forever, as long as the have hope and a purpose.
[2:08:07] <TimesApex> Andre is the Avatar. He just comes back as the same person every time
[2:08:10] <@SoFarFetched> @Rozalyndis hope you're ready for a "comfortable" stream of Paige playing Dark Souls 3 daphCozy

[2:08:23] <Finakala> That's blue, Pat
[2:08:23] <%rei0> that's blue
[2:08:24] <%SvenHolgersson> JUST LIKE SOLAIRE!
[2:08:24] <%noctambulant00> Yeah the old lady isnt such a bitch in this one because Miyazaki knows the DS series isnt about making you feel like shit, its about being determined in the face of hopelessness.

[2:22:33] <@PlagueOfGripes> Where do all these new souls come from if it needs so many? Don't think about that.
[2:22:34] <+Sebenoth> i think its because they had already burnt away part of themselves already that 1 wouldnt be enough?
[2:22:42] <%averyoddjew> gotta go kill 4, becuase he's the only one who actually DOES HIS JOB

[2:27:48] <%SvenHolgersson> Super ballsy Paige is fucking awesome
[2:27:51] <sniffy77> Did you know that some rich fucker bought the original london bridge and moved it to Arizona?
[2:27:51] <%noctambulant00> sword art
[2:27:52] <@commanderclaw> If Paige starts parrying consistently I'm going to have to take up Religion or driking
[2:27:53] <%SvenHolgersson> I love it

[2:28:14] <Rinkimah> Lotta back seaters in here rooBlank
[2:28:15] <EuropanLamprey> Easiest Parry is parrying his weeb stance and hitting L2 the moment he starts to move
[2:28:15] <NireFuster> double FISTING?
[2:28:18] <SirKeigan> L2
[2:28:18] <%TheFilth> d-double fisting?
[2:28:18] <%sleepers1mulant> you gotta stop blocking until you get stunned, you should roll back
[2:28:19] <Kalcom> play like blood
[2:28:19] <KaiserMario> or "iaijutsu"
[2:28:20] <SirKeigan> STANCE
[2:28:24] <the_Graboid> 2 hand and press L2 for weapon skills
[2:28:27] <SirKeigan> Do the stronger stance moves with L2

[2:28:32] <@commanderclaw> @penitentpentwitch The holy church of booze
[2:28:33] <twistedj3ster> If Paige parries him I'll flip
[2:28:35] <2fcd_twitch> Travel to Gundyr's bonfire to avoid the load screen
[2:28:37] <mistermastergreg> @PlagueOfGripes just let anime be cool and dumb man

[2:29:39] <kazadog> @Dhurkst you still take damage and lose stamina like you blocked it but you dont stagger thats all
[2:29:39] <+blastyoboots> I don't think NPCs have infinite stamina, I'm PRETTY SURE they follow the same stamina rules as everyone else in cluding bosses and mobs; he just has a lot of stamina AND gets some moves to free because theyre mana based Focus Moves when he weebs

[2:35:57] <benjiFG> one thing i absolutely hate in ds3 is how a lot of enemies just don't fucking stop attacking
[2:36:02] <+doc_ock_rokc> Paige is syncing with the game soo well
[2:36:02] <%BoxNavy> Pat's Poner
[2:36:05] <T_Sasquatch> @Rinkimah im fine with it, i just thinik its funny because later on the reuse an entire boss and the games somehow have zero connection
[2:36:06] <%MyNameIsRasus> She truly is an alpha gamer
[2:36:07] <hairtoday> paige's been paid for playing dark souls, she's a pro
[2:36:09] <%noctambulant00> All this crazy talk is gonna screw her later on.

[2:36:34] <KaiserMario> Vaati was talking about making rolling in Demon's Souls remake 8-directions like in this game, but I think it'd just make it too good...
[2:36:37] <Enemy_In_Disguise> More like Fun-dead
[2:36:38] <penitentpentwitch> Always a problem, until they turn into trees
[2:36:43] <+angel949> These guys are kinda skeletons, but they still have some flesh
[2:36:50] <+CaptainKarite> We should do somethin about that
[2:36:50] <+Invlux> Banjo music is the new Tiny Dancer
[2:36:50] <+democrazyyy> injected pure mtn dew before the stream started, to get a gamer edge

[2:37:17] <kazadog> @KaiserMario you can omniroll in des by just not locking on and its easy to do dont think it would make a huge difference
[2:37:18] <shinichizio> That was perfect.
[2:37:19] <T_Sasquatch> its ilk is weak to fire ARISEN !
[2:37:23] <Rinkimah> @Zineta She has ADD/ADHD so she would be overly wired.
[2:37:31] <%VaudeVille_Villain_> He's got a terminal case of the Bloodbornes
[2:37:33] <SirKeigan> This is Oolacile on steroids
[2:37:34] <+WingBuffet> does this look infected
[2:37:35] <Habblewater> I don't remember one of these being here
[2:37:36] <%SvenHolgersson> NO MAN IS SAFE
[2:37:36] <Rozalyndis> iudex gundyr had the same problem
[2:37:38] <+Jaysky> This is natural, as father Gwyn intended!
[2:37:38] <penitentpentwitch> In a bit of irony, humanity manifests as snakes
[2:37:38] <Coystick> Fulla Pus, goin' Nus
[2:37:38] <+MrAtheGreat> OTG
[2:37:39] <Enemy_In_Disguise> No confidence
[2:37:39] <+AmanisHouseOfNonsense> So yeah.
[2:37:39] <%Skelegroove> I forgot how loud this enemy is
[2:37:40] <peachy996> shit's nuts
[2:37:40] <$AzureGale> rekt
[2:37:40] <%SvenHolgersson> NOT EVEN GUNDYR
[2:37:41] <Jrocy247> Yea, These Enemies suck....
[2:37:43] <T_Sasquatch> oops
[2:37:43] <+ChrisAlgoo> yep! that's a dark souls!
[2:37:44] <%SMuffinMan> Rekt
[2:37:44] <+Sebenoth> just an ordinary undead
[2:37:46] <+doc_ock_rokc> THE DARK HAS COME
[2:37:49] <APsaull> humans becoming trees, humans becoming goo dragons. boy i sure with there was some sort of explaination
[2:37:50] <%Sphincter_Spelunker> that pus of man, sure is pus-y
[2:37:52] <+gambit_gamble> out of nowhere
[2:37:53] <buddhistmetal> those guys are fucks
[2:37:53] <Archer27> goo man go smash
[2:37:54] <BinaryShuffle> Too much blocking, need to drop shield and become HUGE
[2:37:56] <%Graxdon> Sould be firebombing
[2:37:58] <+angel949> Use the hot stuff 🔥
[2:37:59] <SixthSun2> Always be rolling
[2:38:02] <Bigyanno> time to learn to roll again
[2:38:03] <%MyNameIsRasus> Also firebombs help a lot
[2:38:04] <Valentinius_Anodyne> @Habblewater It's pretty easy to kill the enemy he spawns from before he transforms
[2:38:07] <%TheFilth> big boys roll
[2:38:07] <Novillion> they're weak to fire
[2:38:07] <Shion963> blocks are only for baby hits
[2:38:08] <+Mendin> Pat's Dad: "Eh it'll fall off in the shower"
[2:38:10] <+TheDullaMAN> Also fire
[2:38:11] <AFlyingTaco1> Also use fire
[2:38:11] <Finakala> Just stab them before they change
[2:38:13] <+NecDW4> Aloe Vera? NAH, that's weak shit, you need windex for an infection that rough
[2:38:17] <+MrAtheGreat> Fire is also good
[2:38:18] <%Mr_Pylon> too much puss to block
[2:38:19] <+WingBuffet> all these towertops look the same
[2:38:21] <+zamatermort> Just run up and kill him before he changes
[2:38:24] <@commanderclaw> Block medium and little hits, dodge big ones
[2:38:25] <+OwlLightningMage> Neither
[2:38:25] <%Gatzarlok> Any type of fire is good, I think a torch will even stun them
[2:38:29] <%Graxdon> @Finakala but then you don't get titanite and an ember
[2:38:30] <NireFuster> SKELETON DOG
[2:38:30] <+OwlLightningMage> Use fire
[2:38:31] <+MrAtheGreat> SCORCH AND PURGE
[2:38:34] <%TheFilth> damn that was a good jam
[2:38:35] <Melchior_the_Wise> Paige, are you a horn?
[2:38:38] <SulfurousAcid> I have a snort cog
[2:38:38] <KaiserMario> @kazadog Oh but it does, it requires a bit more awareness and skill to roll unlocked, and it changes how a lot of areas are balanced, think how much easier Maneater can be, for example
[2:38:39] <+MrAtheGreat> Skele-borg
[2:38:40] <Melchior_the_Wise> that was pretty decent
[2:38:42] <SulfurousAcid> *dog
[2:38:44] <Dakuu75> is Paige liking ds3 more than ds2 so far?
[2:38:47] <+MrAtheGreat> Skele-bork
[2:38:50] <skip_johnson> SeriousSloth

[2:39:38] <whitebatsy> Well that just means you won't get invaded
[2:39:42] <+doc_ock_rokc> I LIKE THE WAY YOU DIE BOY
[2:39:48] <2fcd_twitch> Yes you can
[2:39:48] <SirKeigan> @PeachSaliva Use your embers. You get more than enough in a single playthrough. Even if you die a bunch.
[2:39:49] <%king_wragles> How do you do the horn noise, Paige?
[2:39:50] <Jrocy247> Holy Shit, Elmo wants so much Attention from Paige
[2:39:53] <goodguydrew> lol Elmo has been replaced
[2:39:56] <+Jaysky> Isn't Day Paige stronger than Night Paige?
[2:39:58] <+other_badger> path of exile
[2:39:58] <buddhistmetal> he backs up to lure you into the ooze man
[2:40:00] <Valentinius_Anodyne> The Knight is so good because it's the only class that starts with a 100% Physical block shield
[2:40:03] <@PlagueOfGripes> what about NBA Jam, Pat?

[2:40:22] <+MrAtheGreat> GGOD D
[2:40:24] <Bigyanno> dude has like a 5 hit combo
[2:40:25] <%Aleate> That is my problem with this enemy type, yet
[2:40:26] <+Bupkis7> Never stop rolling!
[2:40:27] <%Sphincter_Spelunker> just like Bloodborne
[2:40:29] <%MyBulletsLAG> MyBulletsLAG subscribed with Twitch Prime. 
[2:40:33] <+OwlLightningMage> Fire hurts everything
[2:40:34] <$Solidnick18> left side is weak
[2:40:35] <%MyNameIsRasus> I don't like these enemies
[2:40:36] <SirKeigan> heal
[2:40:36] <%TheFilth> I never fought one of these guys proper
[2:40:39] <+ChrisAlgoo> like most of dark souls you just gotta get in his ass
[2:40:40] <+other_badger> @Gatzarlok it's not the good fire it's the hurty fire
[2:40:42] <+TehPostman> do you know about the back stabbing this before it transforms?
[2:40:44] <+Dives__> Gotta be aggressive with these slime boys
[2:40:45] <Dakuu75> Man, I always jsut bomb these guys. they're ass holes
[2:40:46] <$Solidnick18> oh
[2:40:47] <+Korzodin> Shes doing pretty well though, all things considered
[2:40:49] <%Sphincter_Spelunker> it got rocky
[2:40:51] <%waltzqueen> Death 10?
[2:40:54] <NireFuster> that was actually a pretty good attempt
[2:40:54] <+ChrisAlgoo> I usually just run past those folks
[2:40:54] <+Sebenoth> good enemy design means they never stop attacking
[2:40:55] <APsaull> yah I always void them early game
[2:40:55] <the_Graboid> Hit him hard and fast before he transforms
[2:40:55] <Jrocy247> You can kill him before he transforms
[2:40:55] <+MrAtheGreat> almost tho
[2:40:56] <metalsiren31> I always just cheeze them with fire
[2:40:58] <+doc_ock_rokc> Elmo is KING
[2:41:00] <%Graxdon> If you kill it before it changes you won't get big souls and items
[2:41:00] <NireFuster> death like, 6 or 7 not 10 yet
[2:41:01] <+Korzodin> That guy is a bitch to fight without fire
[2:41:02] <penitentpentwitch> Technically if you do enough damage you can kill him before he transforms
[2:41:03] <%shurtal> Pus of man is SO MUCH LIKE the fucking Guardian Ape it's hilarious
[2:41:03] <SirKeigan> Remember, not everything is meant to be taken on when you first confront it
[2:41:05] <Dakuu75> Look at that bloodborne enemy
[2:41:05] <%Gatzarlok> @other_badger OH so like when some games make friendly fire the blue fire?
[2:41:06] <%chvmpchange> If you kill him before he transforms hes really easy
[2:41:07] <+TehPostman> leftiKEKW
[2:41:09] <+zamatermort> Just kill him before he changes
[2:41:10] <%SegaDSi> these guys suck when you dont know the 2 tricks to them
[2:41:11] <+Izzzyko> run up and kill him b4 he turns
[2:41:14] <%sleepers1mulant> that guys an asshole
[2:41:15] <+Capn_Trips> gott sty in tight, bob and weave bob and weave
[2:41:17] <cureneckbeard> Amazing meatball!
[2:41:23] <+Invlux> Never had a problem with these guys as a pyromancer Kappa
[2:41:23] <goodguydrew> use fire, woman
[2:41:24] <NireFuster> did the dog just do a chomp soun effect?
[2:41:29] <$joylent_blue> Izzzyko shhhhhhhhhhh
[2:41:30] <+Korzodin> Buy some firebombs, yo
[2:41:33] <+OwlLightningMage> Those enemies are bad and Pat's terrible advice isn't helping
[2:41:35] <Dakuu75> @chvmpchange yyyyyyes, technically true. But, then he don't drop his sweet loots
[2:41:39] <+Sebenoth> pat: become zoo
[2:41:39] <Perky_LKM> Elmo is baby
[2:41:39] <Bigyanno> I wonder how Paige feels being the only skinny person in a house of round beings.
[2:41:41] <%BoxNavy> are they gonna fight?
[2:41:42] <%TheFilth> that's too much power for one man to handle
[2:41:43] <penitentpentwitch> Pat dual wielding again
[2:41:45] <trickquestionz> Is Elmo not DA BABY
[2:41:45] <Rionxgarland> pat is the baby man
[2:41:46] <+doc_ock_rokc> @PeachSaliva But isn't elmo the baby!
[2:41:47] <UvBenServed> Jealous
[2:41:47] <+G_Thunders> Is the explanation just that “some undead get a goo snake inside them”? I can’t remember anything else in this game about that enemy
[2:41:48] <%BoxNavy> dont make them have a fight
[2:41:51] <Kalcom> you are baby man
[2:41:53] <NireFuster> WRONG ONE
[2:41:55] <+Jaysky> FUck yer souls I guess
[2:41:57] <s1rcuit> Pat's the biggest baby around
[2:42:01] <ChungusQuest> Does Paige know about holding R2?
[2:42:03] <+NecDW4> WHEE NETWORK ERROR! THANKS CACTUS JACK
[2:42:05] <%Grimlockfly> Pat: Master of Babby SeemsGood100 SeemsGood100
[2:42:05] <+MrAtheGreat> HEAL AGAIN
[2:42:12] <+MrAtheGreat> Estus sucks in this game
[2:42:14] <%ElkRiverDog> coxStitches coxSoup coxSoup
[2:42:15] <NireFuster> "He's actually pretty slow"
[2:42:15] <%Graxdon> @G_Thunders It's an infection of pure Humanity
[2:42:16] <%MyNameIsRasus> Bomb'em
[2:42:16] <sniffy77> Paige these guys are the worst
[2:42:17] <2fcd_twitch> Wow, she's using heavy attacks on wake up
[2:42:18] <+doc_ock_rokc> Go the other way
[2:42:18] <%Grimlockfly> Does she have fire?
[2:42:19] <SirKeigan> Fuck it, do it later
[2:42:19] <dots4eyes> She can't read 'im
[2:42:19] <+Invlux> TIP TIME
[2:42:20] <penitentpentwitch> Hint time?
[2:42:22] <%Grimlockfly> and or bombs?
[2:42:22] <the_Graboid> Paige, you’re great. Every failure is because of Pat’s terrible coaching.
[2:42:23] <zamzoph> just don't fight him 4Head
[2:42:23] <%TheFilth> scary texture man go away!
[2:42:24] <@commanderclaw> Paige is having sensory processing issues
[2:42:24] <+Mendin> It's something like "Since the flame cycle is REALLY burning out ,the chance of humanity in hollows just going full abyss goo keeps increasing"
[2:42:24] <+Dives__> Attack from behind
[2:42:24] <CoffeeSlice> paige will figure it out
[2:42:24] <Jrocy247> Run up to him and kill him before he transform
[2:42:25] <%SvenHolgersson> Are we telling Paige the secret yet?
[2:42:25] <s1rcuit> it looks like the Mold from RE7
[2:42:25] <whitebatsy> HOW CAN THIS BE?
[2:42:25] <+doc_ock_rokc> @Grimlockfly nope
[2:42:25] <$joylent_blue> estus starts out ASS in this game
[2:42:27] <@PlagueOfGripes> I don't have a high opinion of those enemies. You have to just fuck them up
[2:42:28] <SirKeigan> USE FIRE
[2:42:28] <+Korzodin> FIRE
[2:42:30] <Dakuu75> "If you can't beat um... bomb'um."
[2:42:30] <Valentinius_Anodyne> Come back later
[2:42:30] <SirKeigan> FIRE
[2:42:31] <+ArtoriasTheTrenchfighter> Why are you trying to kill him?
[2:42:32] <%chvmpchange> PAIGE THIS ENEMY IS BULLSHIT MOVE ON
[2:42:33] <SirKeigan> USE FIRE
[2:42:33] <%SegaDSi> No dont tell her
[2:42:33] <%CantWalkGood> kill him quick
[2:42:34] <CurrySauseBandit> Hit it in the face
[2:42:34] <goodguydrew> gotta use fire
[2:42:34] <+zamatermort> KILL HIM BEFORE HE TRANSFORMS
[2:42:35] <benjiFG> this enemy kinda sux
[2:42:36] <%sleepers1mulant> this areas the proving ground tbh
[2:42:37] <AFlyingTaco1> I also have trouble with those enemies. Just kill them before they change.
[2:42:38] <@Jekado> he's weak to fire
[2:42:41] <%juxtest> Throw bombs at him until he goes away
[2:42:42] <+doc_ock_rokc> HE HATES fire
[2:42:42] <StalwartZephyr> He's very allergic
[2:42:43] <@Jekado> all puss is
[2:42:44] <jaydubbies> lol what does that do
[2:42:49] <$joylent_blue> THEIR KIND ILL LIKE FIRE
[2:42:50] <Melchior_the_Wise> he's a grass type in the Pokeman;s
[2:42:51] <SirKeigan> THE FIRST ONE
[2:42:55] <RushUnplugged> what does a FIRE. BOMB. do.
[2:42:56] <Melchior_the_Wise> hella weak to fire
[2:42:58] <%MyNameIsRasus> FIRE WORKS WELL
[2:43:00] <SiriusLeeLost> When she gets to the dragon path, make sure she SPRINTS straight upstairs to the tower door!
[2:43:00] <+doc_ock_rokc> Everyone is allergic to fire but he is SUPER allergic
[2:43:02] <SirKeigan> Don't you also have the Estus Ring
[2:43:03] <the_Graboid> Don’t waste bombs. Just kill before he turns
[2:43:03] <+OwlLightningMage> You have to kill them before they transform
[2:43:05] <%noctambulant00> @PlagueOfGripes you dont have a high opinion about a lot of things
[2:43:08] <Bigyanno> honestly that guy's attacks are so weird that it took me ages to learn his attack pattern
[2:43:10] <+mostbrokenrobo> Trace of goblins there
[2:43:10] <+tweedler92> Just bum rush em'
[2:43:13] <2fcd_twitch> Don't just spam fire bombs
[2:43:15] <SirKeigan> JUST RUSH IN AND KILL BEFORE HE BURNS
[2:43:16] <+Dives__> Lore too deep
[2:43:16] <+Sebenoth> fire, and by extension pyro, is fuckin busted in this game
[2:43:20] <+nekodelic> ARISEN, 'TIS WEAK TO FIRE
[2:43:20] <SirKeigan> Turns
[2:43:20] <SulfurousAcid> humanity hates flame?
[2:43:21] <%sleepers1mulant> hes oily hes super afraid of fire
[2:43:21] <KellBeII> its funny seeing paige have the same reaction as me when i first played. i dont even know how im supposed to fight the thing
[2:43:21] <$WETBUTTDISEASE> dark
[2:43:22] <jaydubbies> kill before transforming and save bombs
[2:43:24] <Finakala> Hollows hunt in packs, Arisen
[2:43:25] <penitentpentwitch> Darkness burns really well... for some reason?
[2:43:33] <zamzoph> But the Taurus Demon also hates flame even though it's fire 🤔
[2:43:34] <+PaladinDupre> hates it like I hate communism
[2:43:34] <+Korzodin> All these people saying to kill him before he turns are goons
[2:43:35] <+Undenizen> ooh. what'd i miss?
[2:43:37] <mathbertoldo> Living beings hate flame, just some are more tolerant of it.
[2:43:39] <SirKeigan> ha
[2:43:40] <s1rcuit> is that what those flesh beasts are, darkness manifest?
[2:43:41] <%TheFilth> she's learned the neutral game
[2:43:41] <%SvenHolgersson> PRO GAMER MOVES
[2:43:48] <%Agami23> darkness hates fire because it works really well for kindling. like coal or something
[2:43:49] <Bigyanno> STACK BAB
[2:43:52] <%MyNameIsRasus> HOLLOWGOBLIN, ARISEN
[2:43:52] <%SvenHolgersson> Pretty soon Paige can say the gamer word
[2:43:52] <+ChrisAlgoo> this game got nooch
[2:43:55] <+Invlux> He's wearing Chain Mail lol
[2:43:57] <goodguydrew> its just Venom
[2:43:59] <Melchior_the_Wise> oh, that guy had a haircut? I thought it was a hood. JEez
[2:44:01] <%SvenHolgersson> We just need a certain bridge
[2:44:04] <NireFuster> Did Paige get backstabs on DS2 at all?
[2:44:05] <+mostbrokenrobo> darkness hates fire b/c fire == light
[2:44:05] <SirKeigan> OR DO THAT
[2:44:05] <%MyNameIsRasus> THAT WORKS
[2:44:05] <penitentpentwitch> Victory
[2:44:06] <%TheFilth> tomatoPog
[2:44:06] <+Invlux> LUL oh my god
[2:44:07] <+Sebenoth> its positive feedback, feels good to backstab so you vibe into it easy
[2:44:08] <zamzoph> first try PogChamp
[2:44:10] <Jrocy247> PROBLEM SOLVED
[2:44:10] <+vicar_anat> good enough
[2:44:10] <T_Sasquatch> why is your character so short 🤔
[2:44:11] <+tweedler92> CLAP
[2:44:11] <+Korzodin> She gets nothing for it though
[2:44:11] <%sleepers1mulant> YEYEYEYEYE

[2:44:13] <$joylent_blue> you did it rooHappy
[2:44:14] <penitentpentwitch> And a Raw Gem
[2:44:15] <whitebatsy> If you kill him like that you don't get the thing
[2:44:15] <%Graxdon> But you get poo souls nad no items
[2:44:17] <Zineta> pokemoMazing
[2:44:18] <Bigyanno> that is my prefered strategy
[2:44:18] <SirKeigan> lies
[2:44:23] <+Jaysky> Hey hey chat guy saying that she couldn't do that--
[2:44:23] <the_Graboid> ITS THAT EASY
[2:44:25] <+emperordread> Well done
[2:44:30] <buddhistmetal> still worth for item here
[2:44:30] <+Fooguwu> is pat wrong
[2:44:31] <mathbertoldo> @undenizen Peach being moderately good at DS3, as opposed to the charmingly bad Paige from DS2, imo at least.
[2:44:31] <+MrAtheGreat> now go back and try it again but for realsies this t8ime
[2:44:31] <goodguydrew> booooooo!
[2:44:33] <Bigyanno> you already got the longbow
[2:44:34] <SirKeigan> Does he really drop something else if he changes?
[2:44:35] <%chvmpchange> he respawns so who cares lmao
[2:44:40] <%MyNameIsRasus> I was going to say "Come and get me, Lothric", but that works too!
[2:44:42] <+Korzodin> He does after he transforms
[2:44:44] <+ChrisAlgoo> IT'S RAAAAAAWWW
[2:44:44] <%chvmpchange> just a titanite shard
[2:44:45] <kazadog> @SirKeigan an ember and titanite
[2:44:46] <penitentpentwitch> 2 Raw Gems, what is this luck!?
[2:44:46] <+OwlLightningMage> Who cares
[2:44:46] <+Korzodin> A shard and an ember
[2:44:47] <+MrAtheGreat> He drops an ember iirc
[2:44:52] <SirKeigan> Never knew that. Always rushed in
[2:44:54] <StalwartZephyr> shard
[2:44:54] <%Graxdon> A shard and an ember
[2:44:56] <+axenred> snake boy drops large titanite, goes striaght into inventory
[2:44:57] <+patriotrenegade> drops a shard if you kill him pussed up
[2:44:58] <+Soulsbjorne> shard and an ember
[2:44:59] <%TheFilth> imo not worth the trouble
[2:44:59] <%chvmpchange> which is very good right now
[2:45:03] <heartlesshealer> missed half the stream due to groceries. Is Paige liking the closer to Bloodborne feel of DS3?
[2:45:04] <Jrocy247> It's JUST a Titanite Shard....
[2:45:04] <+Undenizen> @mathbertoldo that's weird. when did paige gain reflexes?
[2:45:04] <2fcd_twitch> He does
[2:45:10] <+PaladinDupre> @MyNameIsRasus I have chosen you randomly to decide if should have another glass of Scotch!
[2:45:11] <%chvmpchange> nah not worth it atm
[2:45:12] <2fcd_twitch> And an ember
[2:45:13] <+Jaysky> Just let her move on
[2:45:13] <%worldbrand> you dont gotta
[2:45:14] <SirKeigan> Fire makes it easy
[2:45:16] <+Sestren413> Its not worth it
[2:45:17] <+Korzodin> Tell her that he drops weapon upgrade juice
[2:45:18] <+Sebenoth> man i got to NG5 and never bothered to let them transform
[2:45:18] <%noctambulant00> titanite shards are everywhere though so
[2:45:18] <+MrAtheGreat> okay then level up first
[2:45:18] <count_bob> DO ET
[2:45:19] <Valentinius_Anodyne> Then don't. It isn't a big deal
[2:45:20] <Melchior_the_Wise> i mean, you don't have to
[2:45:24] <Jrocy247> It's really not worth it
[2:45:24] <%chvmpchange> bad advice
[2:45:26] <%ssjklyco> How is she not lost yet?
[2:45:26] <Bigyanno> the ember is the most important imo. you can early game farm a few embers if you're patient
[2:45:26] <kazadog> @heartlesshealer yes shes a ton better too first try gundyr
[2:45:28] <%MyNameIsRasus> @PaladinDupre the answer to that question is always yes

[2:45:52] <mathbertoldo> @undenizen From Bloodborne mostly. DS3 is flows better and is generally faster than the previous games in the franchise.

[2:48:33] <+democrazyyy> @kazadog my favorite bit of exposition casually thrown out there is "hey yeah all these places you are going to visit used to be super far away. used to, they all MOVED closer physically for some reason."

[2:48:43] <UlriktheSlayer1> MAJESTIC PEEPEE
[2:48:44] <+Korzodin> IF ONLY THERE WAS A WAY TO KNOW YOUR HEALTH AT ALL TIMES
[2:48:45] <$joylent_blue> maybe turn HUD on LUL
[2:48:54] <+MrAtheGreat> note that the estus only helas 40%
[2:48:57] <%Graxdon> Christ Paige, drink your orange juice
[2:49:07] <+Undenizen> "If you want me to not backseat you, you ca-" "PAT WHAT SHOULD I DO?"
[2:49:07] <+Mendin> @PeachSaliva Notice that you have FIVE ESTUS again like DS1, none of this 2 Estus and Lifegems thing from DS2. This mindset is important to get back into
[2:49:10] <%TheFilth> mind goblins: silenced tomatoSmile
[2:49:15] <heartlesshealer> menu with all this noise feels dangerous
[2:49:17] <2fcd_twitch> Never leave yorself at half health
[2:49:20] <buddhistmetal> I prefer on too
[2:49:31] <brows_> Pat, don’t give her any tips. Keep her as blind as possible LUL
[2:49:32] <+Korzodin> @MrAtheGreat It heals a set amount, not a percentage
[2:49:33] <kazadog> @Mendin well you get shards like ds2 and end up with 15 heals
[2:49:46] <Psyramics> he is literally here to backseat you
[2:49:47] <Broand> Authorized to ONE GUY
[2:49:48] <+Order_of_Mystery> why is elmo so big

[2:49:52] <+Mendin> Yeah but I mean at the start, and the gems dont exist
[2:49:54] <Dakuu75> HOW OFTEN does Paige say "let me do it myself, waah"
[2:49:56] <Rozalyndis> rule of thumb: don't help until paige asks
[2:49:59] <penitentpentwitch> Designated Back Seat Orb
[2:50:00] <Rozalyndis> it's kinda simple

[2:50:17] <trickquestionz> If Paige and Woolie had to race to escape from a maze, who'd find their way out first?
[2:50:18] <+MrAtheGreat> @Korzodin I know, the problem is that paige heals but doesn't realize that she's not healing as much as she's expecting it too
[2:50:18] <benjiFG> ghrist
[2:50:18] <SirKeigan> that was great

[2:58:51] <%Aleate> Confidence go up while Pat presence go down
[2:58:54] <the_Graboid> There is a better sword in that courtyard with the dragon fire. You’ll probably die getting it tho.
[2:59:07] <%TheFilth> how many times do you reckon you say "tits" a day?
[2:59:14] <%noctambulant00> I will say you handle the shield guys well
[2:59:18] <SirKeigan> I was about to say run into the room before he breathes for the frst time
[2:59:22] <fruit_pie_the_magician> theres a sweet axe in that mimic though
[2:59:22] <benjiFG> hab confidence

[2:59:37] <KaiserMario> @PeachSaliva LUL CSB 21 2:54:28 Woolie-"Not Minecraft Steve... that would suck." Pat-"Anyone but Minecraft Steve."
[2:59:38] <+kkraww> Need to get closer
[2:59:41] <%SMuffinMan> Nothing wrong with tits
[2:59:42] <+kkraww> To set him off
[2:59:42] <+Undenizen> I guess I would two if I had some attached to me.
[2:59:43] <AFlyingTaco1> She's actually doing pretty good so far
[2:59:45] <SirKeigan> You have to roll in
[2:59:49] <tusk102> JUST JOINED IN HOLY SHIT
[2:59:51] <SirKeigan> Run RUN RUN
[2:59:53] <kazadog> SHE STILL HASNT GONE TO THE EYE DOCTOR????
[2:59:57] <cureneckbeard> Paige you should go to the eye doctor.
[2:59:57] <$joylent_blue> T_Sasquatch i think she knows Wolnir exists (of course) but nothing else
[2:59:57] <eriksdrums> Are these the ones with the guessed prescription?
[2:59:58] <%Aleate> w o o
[2:59:58] <SirKeigan> stop
[3:00:00] <SirKeigan> TURN AROUND
[3:00:01] <NireFuster> Paige it's been years are you actually going to get new glasses?
[3:00:02] <%SMuffinMan> Tits are good

[3:00:19] <+TopTieramisu> #loudbitch
[3:00:19] <Jrocy247> Yea don't go out there with that Dragon around
[3:00:20] <Dhurkst> Didn't she promise to go to the eye doctor YEARS AGO?
[3:00:22] <+TheSaintJohn> here we go
[3:00:23] <T_Sasquatch> @joylent_blue ohh that makes way more sense now
[3:00:25] <+WingBuffet> tornado KEEEEEECK

[3:00:28] <%Graxdon> Oh, that's a bold choice
[3:00:28] <+patriotrenegade> HUHUHUH
[3:00:29] <+TheSaintJohn> rip
[3:00:31] <kazadog> i love the noises mimics make so much
[3:00:31] <Jrocy247> COMMAND GRAB
[3:00:33] <heartlesshealer> BYE SOULS
[3:00:33] <+GinAndRoses> he munch
[3:00:33] <+TopTieramisu> SUCC
[3:00:34] <blue8moon> why no get souls first?
[3:00:34] <dots4eyes> Command grab stronk
[3:00:34] <tusk102> how is peach able to play this game at midnight
[3:00:35] <skyentombment> SHE'S GONNA USE THE ROAD THAT HURTS HER EVERY TIME
[3:00:35] <T_Sasquatch> this guy hits hardddd
[3:00:35] <@PlagueOfGripes> mimics are a minor issue in this game
[3:00:35] <TechGamer> Ooof
[3:00:36] <%sleepers1mulant> the grab sucks
[3:00:36] <@Jekado> nommed
[3:00:36] <%worldbrand> oh yeah that mimic is terrifying even when you know it's there
[3:00:36] <%Aleate> tfuCry
[3:00:37] <TuxedoNash> and it's allllll gonnnnee
[3:00:38] <+patriotrenegade> TASTUMAKI SEMPUUUKEN
[3:00:38] <+doc_ock_rokc> Mimics are Badasses
[3:00:38] <+RealThiele> grabbed
[3:00:39] <+Sebenoth> aw, i was hoping it'd roundhouse her
[3:00:39] <mathbertoldo> GG
[3:00:40] <Zineta> doodDed
[3:00:40] <+Undenizen> VORE'D
[3:00:41] <Melchior_the_Wise> you were very yummy
[3:00:41] <%SMuffinMan> THE COMMAND GRAB
[3:00:42] <count_bob> Nom nom nom nom
[3:00:43] <PrettyThickandStrongDyck> ... Paige
[3:00:43] <%TheFilth> good rule of thumb is boys twice your size you need to roll
[3:00:44] <SirKeigan> It's always death. Two-hand and circle strafe
[3:00:44] <eriksdrums> UNAVOIDABLE CHIN MOVE!
[3:00:49] <%causewaybob> Did you guys know chimps have entered a Stone Age experts say
[3:00:57] <Zantetzuken> 0-2 mimic
[3:00:58] <+lord_campbell96> May wanna break that habit LUL
[3:00:59] <Kalcom> grab beats block
[3:00:59] <skyentombment> PEACHES, SHIELD IS BLOCK
[3:00:59] <derekwst3> your chin is to big, i catches you quick
[3:01:00] <%AxelCezar> mashing L1 R1 actually stops that thing
[3:01:02] <tylerpyre> imagine trying to block in Dark Souls III
[3:01:02] <Jrocy247> Wrong way Paige
[3:01:03] <+zamatermort> do both
[3:01:03] <%coreyyotto> honestly you should probably two-hand against the mimics
[3:01:07] <skyentombment> BIG SWORD IS ROLL
[3:01:12] <Halidar> just stopped by to say I loved the DS2 run, and I'm looking forward to watching the VoDs of this run. Have fun!
[3:01:13] <%TheWinged7> drop your sheild Paige LUL
[3:01:14] <%chvmpchange> YOU WANNA ROLL FOR EVERYTHING HE DOES
[3:01:14] <kylecoolperson> He isn't worth the trouble.
[3:01:16] <%SMuffinMan> Eriks LUL
[3:01:19] <SirKeigan> @causewaybob that was in 2015 lol
[3:01:23] <%Keyd00d> When Paige has shield she no block
[3:01:24] <+doc_ock_rokc> @causewaybob Nuke em from orbit. Establish the natural order
[3:01:26] <Rozalyndis> chat and their sass
[3:01:28] <whitebatsy> That was 23 days ago
[3:01:28] <%cylish> Peach its been like 3 hours
[3:01:29] <%sleepers1mulant> rolling around mimics is prob the best way to handle them
[3:01:30] <skyentombment> YOSSSSSS
[3:01:30] <+demon1103> that mimics a bit of a pain...not to mention the hitboxes.....
[3:01:32] <%Aleate> Rolling in this game feels so GOOD
[3:01:33] <mathbertoldo> They're easy to deal with, but hit like a truck.
[3:01:40] <Kalcom> embrace fast
[3:01:40] <the_Graboid> Try L2
[3:01:42] <+Undenizen> @causewaybob how do they figure? Ages are typically only defied at least an age after the fact
[3:01:51] <+parzano> can we get a "tits" counter
[3:01:54] <T_Sasquatch> They see you rolling and they are hating
[3:01:54] <KaiserMario> @PeachSaliva Mashing the bumpers/triggers helps taking less damage from grabs
[3:01:57] <Jrocy247> Hey, Tbf. Paige has been doing really good so far
[3:01:57] <%SMuffinMan> Tits are good
[3:02:02] <+lord_campbell96> Two handing with a baby sword doesnt change much
[3:02:04] <+Sebenoth> well.. blocking and rolling both have uses in this game, no need for either to be a dominant strat
[3:02:04] <GravyLangley> right in the pooper
[3:02:18] <+doc_ock_rokc> @parzano we do not have enough numbers
[3:02:18] <PrettyThickandStrongDyck> Someone on YT should count all the times live says tits
[3:02:24] <skyentombment> IT'S A NO DEFENSE STRATEGY, LET'S SEE HOW IT PLAYS OUT COTTON
[3:02:26] <Kalcom> false blocking is for chumps
[3:02:28] <+lord_campbell96> damage wise I meam
[3:02:29] <+parzano> @doc_ock_rokc then MAKE BIGGER NUMBERS
[3:02:45] <%Keyd00d> make sure to use it
[3:02:46] <+Mitchellsocks> Lol, this guy always gets me
[3:02:48] <derekwst3> i want a dnd game where i have a mimic as a companion, no one but me and the game master knows of the mimic, until stupidity happens
[3:02:54] <+kkraww> Unless it helps you learn to roll better
[3:03:00] <Drusain> Paige do you remember how to kick?
[3:03:04] <kazadog> shame nobody told her about the weapon art so she can instantly break his block
[3:03:07] <%TheFilth> never listen to chat for advice, we're all cryptids
[3:03:07] <phantalime> drop your shield up
[3:03:08] <Dhurkst> @tylerpyre It's just as viable as ever, dude
[3:03:11] <+RealThiele> rip
[3:03:17] <+parzano> Paige when is Pat gonna do Tik Tok dances
[3:03:18] <%Aleate> That floating armor outside tfuKEK
[3:03:19] <penitentpentwitch> Open door first!
[3:03:24] <+kkraww> Paige you can go the other way and not take damage
[3:03:25] <%Lunarhawk> It's a shame shes not killing the dragon to get the claymore
[3:03:26] <+TheDullaMAN> Forget the chest for now!
[3:03:31] <%theamazingroberto> HYPE
[3:03:33] <@PlagueOfGripes> be cool about fire safety
[3:03:33] <Jrocy247> If he Grabs, ROLL
[3:03:33] <+doc_ock_rokc> dont touch him
[3:03:36] <+Invlux> you can see it breathing LUL
[3:03:38] <+Sebenoth> eh, i'll concede blocking is probably more of a fallback, like eating a sweep or strafe from midir when you cant any distance
[3:03:38] <%SilvaChariot0133> Just kill it before it kills you 4Head
[3:03:39] <ChungusQuest> Charge R2 for big first hit!
[3:03:41] <heartlesshealer> =)
[3:03:42] <the_Graboid> Hold R2 for charge attack
[3:03:44] <%coreyyotto> like at least two-hand R2 for the first couple of hits while it can't do anything
[3:03:45] <%causewaybob> I think it has more the do with there frequent use of tools the internet is a weird place
[3:03:46] <%sleepers1mulant> wheres drake sword in this i cant remember
[3:03:49] <TheZearGuy> Should collect those items under the dragon
[3:03:49] <%theamazingroberto> how many bosses in is she?
[3:03:52] <skyentombment> LETS COME BACK ONCE THE GAME IS FINISHED
[3:03:53] <+kkraww> 0
[3:03:58] <+WingBuffet> gross, DS2 rules
[3:03:59] <%noctambulant00> it is
[3:04:00] <derekwst3> back stab the mimic
[3:04:02] <kazadog> @sleepers1mulant nowhere
[3:04:03] <+kkraww> well 1 boss
[3:04:04] <TheyCallMeVawn> But DS2 is better
[3:04:04] <+Mekhet09> It's way too nostalgic.
[3:04:04] <jorniev> I DO NOW
[3:04:05] <%Keyd00d> That's a bit unfair
[3:04:05] <%worldbrand> i got that vibe too yes
[3:04:07] <+SoaringTrumpet> ds2 was fine but different
[3:04:07] <%Aleate> Yes Kappa
[3:04:14] <%Keyd00d> Well you didn't play the best part
[3:04:14] <TechGamer> I do
[3:04:15] <derekwst3> yes
[3:04:16] <+lord_campbell96> Ds2 is bad tbh
[3:04:16] <%noctambulant00> DS2 is horrid
[3:04:19] <Jrocy247> Yea-No DS2 sucks
[3:04:22] <T_Sasquatch> STOP HATING ON DS2 NotLikeThis
[3:04:22] <+Xooler67> bs
[3:04:23] <+WingBuffet> Vendrick and his castle are the coolest shit in DS
[3:04:23] <Melchior_the_Wise> The DLC saves it
[3:04:24] <+doc_ock_rokc> DS2 has the best spells but its HORRIBLE
[3:04:24] <KingKZ> It is.
[3:04:25] <+CaptainKarite> It felt like Pat was trying to sell the good parts
[3:04:26] <TechGamer> In comparison to other yes DS2 is the worst
[3:04:27] <heartlesshealer> lolno it was just long
[3:04:27] <+MisterTylerrr> Ds2 is the worst of the series. But it's still a wonderful game
[3:04:30] <dizimous> DS2 is at least slightly bad
[3:04:32] <kazadog> ds2 is good you all are just babies
[3:04:33] <+lord_campbell96> ambitious but missed the mark
[3:04:33] <%sleepers1mulant> @kazadog fuck you're right, thats cinders
[3:04:33] <jorniev> i like ds2 but yeaah
[3:04:33] <%causewaybob> Also just realized I was gifted a sub thanks buddies
[3:04:33] <%noctambulant00> DS2 had some ok ideas but it wasnt great
[3:04:35] <%TheFilth> nah man you should watch a 10 hour series explaining why it's shit Kappa
[3:04:36] <derekwst3> the dlc is better but i agree the game wasnt great
[3:04:37] <xanerts> not liking ds2 is fine lol
[3:04:37] <%SMuffinMan> DS2 apologists BTFO sipsipDab
[3:04:38] <+parzano> PAT DO BIG DANCES
[3:04:41] <+WingBuffet> faaair enouuuugh
[3:04:44] <+Sebenoth> DS2, if nothing else, has a wide variety of builds
[3:04:50] <+demon1103> its weird....theres part of me that is into DS2....but I think thats the character creation whore in me, and DS@ has good build diversity
[3:04:50] <+RealThiele> stab his dick
[3:04:50] <Melchior_the_Wise> DS2 PVP though...
[3:04:52] <+Xooler67> Ds2 still my favorite of the series
[3:04:52] <+G_Thunders> This feels like discount Bloodborne with a lot of DS1 fan service to me. DS2 actually felt like it’s own thing
[3:04:53] <+transporterthesequel> Dark Souls 2 is still better than like, 90% of games
[3:04:53] <+HotZoneTurtle> Dark Souls 2's biggest problem was that it was called Dark Souls 2. If it wasn't a numbered entry, I feel like it would have been received better.
[3:04:53] <penitentpentwitch> Tatsu!
[3:04:55] <+parzano> did that mimic just tatsumaki?
[3:04:55] <+Kavtech> DS2 Isn't a great game but it's super fun.
[3:04:55] <dagreenpillow> DLC for DS2 is great thooo
[3:04:57] <the_Graboid> DS2 is special to me because it was my first, but I know it’s the worst
[3:04:57] <mathbertoldo> Ds2 is good, it's just usually considered the worst out of the three.
[3:04:57] <eriksdrums> Dark Souls 2 put Steve into Smash
[3:05:01] <+Undenizen> I really liked DS2's hollowing system. I wish they kept it.
[3:05:01] <+MisterTylerrr> It's a tatsu!!
[3:05:02] <%TigerCatGo> Everyone has different taste. On that note, DS2 SUCKS BALLS.
[3:05:02] <NireFuster> CHOMP CHOMP CHOMP
[3:05:03] <hawkhollywood> its a great game just not a very good dark souls
[3:05:04] <+angel949> Twist his dick!
[3:05:05] <+doc_ock_rokc> Dead
[3:05:05] <+Jaysky> Nom nom
[3:05:06] <+ChrisAlgoo> GET VORED
[3:05:06] <+Mekhet09> DS3 is much worse game imo because it's just nostalgia which I found way more obnoxious.
[3:05:07] <NireFuster> VORE TIME
[3:05:07] <+kkraww> Chompy boi
[3:05:07] <Dhurkst> TATSUMAKI SENPUKYAKU
[3:05:07] <Jrocy247> I NEVER seen him go for TWO grabs
[3:05:09] <Mr_Strut> Always looked more like balet to me
[3:05:09] <%Hick12> DS3 has great bosses, but is probably the game where they played it the safest.
[3:05:09] <GravyLangley> THE TRU BOSS OF DS3
[3:05:09] <+RealThiele> yum
[3:05:10] <heartlesshealer> F
[3:05:10] <+chiazam> MMMMMMMmmmmmm
[3:05:12] <GunEden> be better
[3:05:12] <CandyCoatedConfection> Liking DS2 takes a certain intellect that most others don't possess.
[3:05:13] <Melchior_the_Wise> He telegraphs it super hard
[3:05:13] <Zantetzuken> big chomps
[3:05:14] <+Jaysky> By not getting grabbed
[3:05:14] <skyentombment> And that's a hat trick, bois!
[3:05:14] <+nekodelic> use your devil trigger
[3:05:15] <alwayspronking> I think R1 and L1 mash struggle gets you out?
[3:05:15] <TheyCallMeVawn> Well you can roll
[3:05:15] <%Graxdon> How can this be?
[3:05:17] <derekwst3> we need a mimic chest pokemon
[3:05:17] <Bigyanno> just walk under his legs
[3:05:17] <Kalcom> mimic best fighter
[3:05:17] <+Mendin> Yes, th at mimic did the Tatsumaki Senpyukaku
[3:05:18] <+lord_campbell96> horse fuck valley alone makes it worse than any game ever made
[3:05:19] <+RealThiele> GUT GID
[3:05:19] <%krabthecrab> Vored vored vored!
[3:05:20] <VritraReiRei> Get Good Kappa
[3:05:20] <TechGamer> How is it you beat the 1st boss on first try but die to a Mimic!?
[3:05:22] <+WingBuffet> PATented
[3:05:24] <+parzano> PAT PRO TIPS
[3:05:24] <%sleepers1mulant> I don't like DS2 bc DS3 was my first DS
[3:05:25] <NireFuster> Peach just got VORED
[3:05:25] <T_Sasquatch> rmzLURK rmzCRY
[3:05:25] <BinaryShuffle> PATented
[3:05:26] <the_Graboid> You can hold R2 for a charged attack
[3:05:27] <chhdez> Just the tip
[3:05:28] <@PlagueOfGripes> I think you can also mash buttons to get out of the grab earlier? That seems like something DaS3 would do
[3:05:29] <+Sebenoth> PATented
[3:05:30] <+kkraww> GIT GUD
[3:05:32] <+TheDullaMAN> A Pat-ented Protip
[3:05:33] <Melchior_the_Wise> that was the Tip
[3:05:34] <+kkraww> Thats the pro ip
[3:05:34] <Melchior_the_Wise> lol
[3:05:36] <cureneckbeard> pat ented.
[3:05:38] <%noctambulant00> Miyazaki not being a big presence with 2 really hurt the games flow. Everything from the boss fights to the enemy placement.
[3:05:40] <%causewaybob> Wa ta goes the mimic
[3:05:40] <Kalcom> try dodge
[3:05:43] <Lancaster_H> Finally we're back to average Paige performance
[3:05:49] <Kalcom> don't get hit
[3:05:52] <%TheFilth> mmm meaty
[3:05:54] <+other_badger> Kreygasm
[3:06:03] <NireFuster> Peach just let that enemy do that thing and she just stood there...
[3:06:06] <+D00msDayDan> this game is basically bloodborne 2
[3:06:06] <%worldbrand> and you can do it two-handed for even bigger numbers
[3:06:06] <%linSP> shes gonna hit it alright
[3:06:06] <+RealThiele> no sparking tho
[3:06:07] <%sleepers1mulant> big hits yeye
[3:06:09] <penitentpentwitch> Whirligig Axe
[3:06:10] <%Skelegroove> I think you can mash out of mimics in all the games it is just super difficult
[3:06:11] <+angel949> Visceral Attacks
[3:06:14] <copicmario> Seeing a new dark soul from Paige is like seeing there is a new Berserk chapter
[3:06:18] <$ItsRatman> nothing better than a meaty R2
[3:06:26] <+demon1103> I think if not for the majority of bosses being lackluster, and the amount of BS in it, DS2 would be amazing
[3:06:28] <AFlyingTaco1> Jeez I keep forgetting that Paige beat the shit outta Bloodborne
[3:06:33] <%Aleate> Elmo has graced us with his presence once more sipsipHellmo
[3:06:33] <%TheFilth> the charge is great for hammers in this
[3:06:34] <+Sebenoth> DS2 was also the first souls game i didnt bounce off of, so i have a soft spot for it
[3:06:37] <Bigyanno> This is the time of Paige
[3:06:40] <EuropanLamprey> When are Weapon Arts getting explained?
[3:06:43] <kazadog> @copicmario come on now at least you know paige will eventually finish them
[3:06:44] <+zamatermort> backstab, step forward, charge R2
[3:06:48] <LoliKappa> real face-sitting hours
[3:06:51] <Melchior_the_Wise> elmo, sit on my face.
[3:06:52] <Melchior_the_Wise> lol
[3:06:56] <NireFuster> elmo facesits paige?

[3:07:01] <Rozalyndis> sakuButt sakuBlind
[3:07:03] <T_Sasquatch> To be fiar ds2 was my first dark souls game so im heavily biased
[3:07:05] <$joylent_blue> people will be arguing about DS2 for millennia to come, 'tis a fact of life
[3:07:06] <%krabthecrab> Sit on my face and tell me that you love me
[3:07:12] <Melchior_the_Wise> The lore of this get weirder every time
[3:07:12] <+lord_campbell96> I played all of ds2, got to the water DLC and gave up because I hated it
[3:07:17] <%Keyd00d> I forgot Woolie never finished Sekiro ;_;
[3:07:20] <%Graxdon> Drank
[3:07:21] <heartlesshealer> Does Elmo like Paige face because she overheats from the inability to sweat?
[3:07:22] <Kalcom> ds2 is an awful boring game if you use the poise build
[3:07:30] <+RealThiele> run away!
[3:07:37] <kazadog> @Kalcom thats all souls games
[3:07:37] <Torivore> Pat might just not remember weapon arts
[3:07:47] <twoto858> nice

[3:07:55] <penitentpentwitch> Possibly?
[3:07:58] <%Graxdon> There's only a few cool weapon arts
[3:08:01] <%Keyd00d> he likes the heat
[3:08:05] <$Puhff> do you poop tho?
[3:08:08] <heartlesshealer> so that makes you even more special to him
[3:08:10] <$rdark_ksu> buy that cat a heatin pad

[3:08:11] <$joylent_blue> rekt
[3:08:13] <%Keyd00d> cool guy
[3:08:13] <skyentombment> Once again, watch as we come back to the mimic once the game's finished
[3:08:15] <kazadog> @Graxdon only a few cool ones but most of them are useful
[3:08:16] <%noctambulant00> Thats just timmy, dont mind him
[3:08:18] <kylecoolperson> These knights are good to parry.
[3:08:18] <+RealThiele> norman reedus
[3:08:18] <T_Sasquatch> a cool guy
[3:08:18] <+ChrisAlgoo> look at all those nelo angelos

[3:08:19] <+parzano> no paige does not poop
[3:08:19] <+Undenizen> he's a cool guy
[3:08:19] <+Sebenoth> i wonder if people also conflate "i like DS2" as "you're wrong tho, its good!"
[3:08:21] <Bigyanno> It's mr no joke lite
[3:08:24] <Mr_Strut> Look at this fucking hero
[3:08:25] <skyentombment> welp, that's as far as we go
[3:08:28] <+chiazam> Oh she ran into the knights
[3:08:28] <+LouieRouie> Some guy
[3:08:29] <Melchior_the_Wise> bunch of assholes is what they are
[3:08:29] <%juxtest> Return of the Red Eyed Knight
[3:08:30] <%TheFilth> big and strong!
[3:08:33] <+angel949> I'm Well
[3:08:34] <+Undenizen> yeah this game does that
[3:08:36] <+doc_ock_rokc> Mr, Welcome to darksouls son
[3:08:38] <Kalcom> strong guys defeated:1
[3:08:38] <%Aleate> You are doing really well Paige. That is an introduction to an enemy type
[3:08:40] <%causewaybob> That’s Jim and billy
[3:08:42] <Jojoludens> his boyfriend
[3:08:44] <Slimeking_Mike> No, that guy you just fought is HARD for your first playthrough
[3:08:45] <penitentpentwitch> Progress Levels: Above Average
[3:08:45] <Bigyanno> but hey open door! no more running through fire!
[3:08:47] <grimmm99> Please roll more
[3:08:57] <%Aleate> PogChamp
[3:08:58] <+Kahylen123> Can’t use up all your stamina
[3:09:00] <%Aleate> That roll was sick
[3:09:04] <%sleepers1mulant> GOOD KICK
[3:09:08] <%Parapattern> They're just some rowdy bois
[3:09:12] <%Gatzarlok> 3 games in and paige still is surprised when she has trouble in games that are notoriously difficult.
[3:09:17] <Jrocy247> Does DS3 AI read your inputs and knows when you're spamming Attack when you're cornered?
[3:09:26] <+realm_forge> The space between bonfires are essentially stretches of roguelike gameplay
[3:09:31] <kazadog> @Jrocy247 i strongly doubt it
[3:09:34] <NireFuster> p h a t
[3:09:35] <%Hick12> Paige will be doing no hit NG+7 runs soon.
[3:09:43] <KaiserMario> I'm listening to "Blue Water Fangs" in the background and it makes this stream even better
[3:09:49] <+Undenizen> @Jrocy247 no, but if you're not timing your attacks it has a tendency to fuck you
[3:09:55] <$joylent_blue> paige needs to have a more positive body image BibleThump
[3:09:58] <+RealThiele> yeet
[3:10:01] <AFlyingTaco1> Pat she had plenty of time right there lol
[3:10:04] <+angel949> that's a bug
[3:10:06] <mathbertoldo> @sebenoth Good point. I think the better, unbiased way to say this would be "I like blank" instead of affirming "blank is good and if you say otherwise you're wrong".
[3:10:13] <Melchior_the_Wise> The Trees are people too
[3:10:16] <Artflop> You're doing great Paige! themagSad
[3:10:18] <+Tman451> ???
[3:10:18] <kazadog> @mathbertoldo big truth
[3:10:21] <Melchior_the_Wise> sounds like some hippy shit
[3:10:23] <NireFuster> do it you coward you won't
[3:10:23] <TungstenViper> ???
[3:10:27] <Jrocy247> @kazadog Well, you know how at some points when your cornered or panicking to roll out, the AI just goes fucking insane and start spam attacking you.
[3:10:28] <+Tarage> Make Paige play 13 Sentinals.
[3:10:33] <%TheFilth> forget about him huh?
[3:10:35] <%SilvaChariot0133> Hello There

[3:10:57] <kazadog> @Jrocy247 most enemies do that anyway you jst arent in a position to back off or interrupt them so they stop
[3:10:57] <+RealThiele> CAUSE ITS EASY
[3:10:58] <TheZearGuy> There we go
[3:10:58] <Zantetzuken> no personal space given
[3:10:58] <+demon1103> DS3 definitely tends to be more of Guerrilla warfare, get a few hits in and dip out

[3:12:21] <%TheFilth> tomatoConcern
[3:12:25] <$joylent_blue> OneThousandTomatoes paige forgot about the enemy that killed her not 5 minutes ago and got killed by it again
[3:12:39] <+HotZoneTurtle> @kyh9 Thats amazing. DBD just announced that there will be cross progression between Stadia and Steam.
[3:12:52] <kazadog> could be a good moment to teach weapon arts
[3:12:53] <+Undenizen> ahh.

[3:13:55] <+HotZoneTurtle> @kyh9 Honestly took it longer than I thought!
[3:13:58] <Jrocy247> Either Circle Strafe or practice your Parry
[3:14:03] <+TheSaintJohn> humanity at risk
[3:14:04] <%Graxdon> Clearly this lothric knight is mightier than Gundyr
[3:14:05] <%sleepers1mulant> Star wars squadrons is unpacking for me
[3:14:05] <NireFuster> Paige hit the guy before he screams PLEASE
[3:14:05] <EuropanLamprey> Watch Paige die 12 times to that Knight but stomp the boss
[3:14:05] <Kalcom> DS2 poisoned her
[3:14:06] <+TheDullaMAN> This is in your possession.
[3:14:08] <NireFuster> Don't let him scream
[3:14:08] <the_Graboid> Free claymore in the dragons breath

[3:14:27] <+Invlux> it takes SO MUCH TIME for such little soul
[3:14:29] <TechGamer> Free EXP
[3:14:29] <GravyLangley> its basically free money
[3:14:29] <%Keyd00d> Paige dares not kill the innocent
[3:14:29] <Djinnazz> Thye're not women
[3:14:31] <+Undenizen> they're not MUCH money.
[3:14:32] <NireFuster> PAIGE JUST HIT HIM BEFORE HE DOES TEH THING YOU LITERALLY BACKED AWAYYYYY
[3:14:32] <+TheSaintJohn> wombo
[3:14:33] <Melchior_the_Wise> because paige isn't a psychopath

[3:14:35] <Ell1ot> they're not women, Pat
[3:14:35] <%coreyyotto> not everyone has a murder boner
[3:14:36] <%TheFilth> she's not about ware crimes
[3:14:37] <Dhurkst> "I find that interesting that you're not being a psycho"
[3:14:38] <BlkFlameKami> pat is the evil twin
[3:14:41] <count_bob> It's free money paige.
[3:14:43] <penitentpentwitch> The time cost is not worth the investment
[3:14:44] <UlriktheSlayer1> pat is shocked paige doesnt murder for money
[3:14:46] <$joylent_blue> NireFuster use your inside voice rooSip
[3:14:48] <OneThousandTomatoes> Interesting, you aren't killing everyone

[3:14:55] <Torivore> Isn't only like 10 souls? What's the point
[3:14:56] <kazadog> you sure struck that fetus first
[3:14:59] <+doc_ock_rokc> In the arena of logic paige fights unarmed
[3:15:00] <+Sebenoth> but what if we told paige theyre female undead?
[3:15:02] <%Aleate> Oh yeah tfuKEK
[3:15:04] <Smaenus> You KNOW shes BARREN
[3:15:07] <%Hick12> You struck Gundyr first.

[3:16:42] <Grandma_Amari> Paige is a a hobbit with gigantism

[3:31:20] <Rozalyndis> this is why meditation practices give you something to focus on
[3:31:20] <+HostilePoundcakes> yeah that happens
[3:31:24] <$rdark_ksu> i cant meditate because my intrusive thoughts are super mean
[3:31:27] <Rozalyndis> like "you are now breathing manually"
[3:31:29] <Jrocy247> My Mind is too Horny for Meditation. :)
[3:31:30] <DXLelouch24> Paige im adhd thoughts dont stop meditation the key is to let them be and ignore them
[3:31:32] <%CommanderSqueaks> Lists and calendars.
[3:31:34] <+Ropcord> paige have you tried Hard Needle Drugs
[3:31:36] <%sleepers1mulant> Sleep sucks when you have ADHD because your thoughts start to race
