[0:09:59] <+the_mental_punk> @peachsaliva hiccups
[0:10:02] <~PeachSaliva> Oh boy
[0:10:06] <%dankjerri> but
[0:10:07] <%Velociraptor_Cleftes> it's like the video freezes for half a second occasionally
[0:10:09] <%peyodogo> video freezes for just a sec, audio keeps going
[0:10:13] <JobbedBone> I hate problems like this BibleThump so hard to diagnose
[0:10:14] <%dankjerri> its fine rn
[0:10:15] <~PeachSaliva> Well, that's not good.
[0:10:22] <+Archphronimos> to be fair, they're pretty small drops when they do happen at least
[0:10:24] <anfiilookinsgood> it fine :D
[0:10:25] <%dankjerri> its probably twitch servers again
[0:10:31] <%peyodogo> yeah, it's not too bad
[0:10:34] <%dankjerri> looks like its cleared up
[0:10:36] <+the_mental_punk> Yeah my guess is twitch
[0:10:56] <%Velociraptor_Cleftes> every time we've said it cleared up, it hiccups again within 30 seconds LIKE THAT
[0:11:04] <~PeachSaliva> Yeah, it's weird because it says I'm in the green.
[0:11:07] <~PeachSaliva> Not sure what else to do.
[0:11:08] <+the_mental_punk> Twitch may be doing a Fucky Wucky
[0:11:10] <anfiilookinsgood> im from australia 1-2 frame drop is normal
[0:11:15] <%dankjerri> twitch is just fucking with us
[0:11:16] <%AncelDeLambert> you can stop and restart the stream
[0:11:17] <VritraReiRei> Guess we know what time it is: PAAAATTTTTTTT

[0:11:27] <%peyodogo> oop
[0:11:29] <+Archphronimos> @PeachSaliva makes it sound like it's a Twitch server problem
[0:11:44] <augusta_wind> this music bumps
[0:11:51] <+the_mental_punk> Have we tried prayer
[0:11:51] <%Velociraptor_Cleftes> unless Pat's doing something real weird with your connection, it's probably not on your end?
[0:11:55] <%patriotrenegade> doodFps doodFps doodFps
[0:11:57] <%dankjerri> choppy video is whatever, audio is just fine thats whay i come for
[0:12:07] <%peyodogo> yeah we've obviously not been praying hard enough
[0:12:18] <%Velociraptor_Cleftes> unless you've changed something with your software that plays this loop?
[0:12:34] <+the_mental_punk> Why has god abandoned us, is it cause of the furry stuff
