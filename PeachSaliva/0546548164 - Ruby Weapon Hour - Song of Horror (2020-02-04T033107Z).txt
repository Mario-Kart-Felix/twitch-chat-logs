[0:16:41] <%Jekado> probably some racist thing in dolphin speak
[0:16:42] <$NekoUrabe> Cheer100 Cheer100 Pat once said he was going to die before Griffith gets his comeuppance. I think I’m going to die before Paige goes to the eye doctor. LUL

[0:16:49] <benjiFG> I like your shirt
[0:16:49] <+ArtoriasTheTrenchfighter> It's funny because they were obviously trying to do a Groot reference but they completely bombed it with Baby Nut as the name
[0:16:50] <Sphincter_Spelunker> cheer200 So I can relate to Paige's bad luck now. Many hands are tied and I need to remind myself, "Wait, I can't do that, that's illegal." On a lighter note, how about that Skull bean bag chair on the subreddit? I kinda want one too.

[0:46:02] <trueherobappo> Age backwards
[0:46:02] <jijipose> I haven't been carded since I was 17...
[0:46:03] <AMajorTom> Iowa's precincts are slower than usual to report caucus results.
[0:46:03] <BaronVonMagpie> Ive looked like an old boot heel since i was a teenager
[0:46:06] <%XeroSigmaPrime> PAIGE IS VAMPIRE CONFIRMED
[0:46:06] <Able195> Dont let it set in
[0:46:07] <RubberFistFight> I'm turning 37 in may and I get carded on the regular. Also the Out Of Context Paige Quotes guy thought I was only like 25 based on what I look like. I enjoy both of these things.
[0:46:07] <%WheatlyXT> I only don't get carded at my bar because I go there too often oop--
[0:46:08] <LiquidMathew> at least the weed stores card you

[0:46:25] <derap41> Its so fucking good
[0:46:25] <%ShockzNDrawe> it's fucked up
[0:46:26] <jerkhov_> sounds neat
[0:46:26] <%SoFarFetched> Someone I know got fired for not checking a card on a woman who was definitely super old. Guess the woman got upset about not being carded.
[0:46:27] <TimetodiveLTX> itll hit her harder than its hitting you
[0:46:28] <$Jack_of_No_Trades> i havent been carded since i was 16, I had to tell them I was a child. Going grey early really made it weird

[1:04:45] <Jeemukun> Thanks for the LuvSnooze @realm_forge
[1:04:45] <Camail> digimon fuckers are a wide variety
[1:04:46] <mankeyfigh> @PeachSaliva The true story is Pat would sacrifice his body to save Paige and Elmo
[1:04:48] <Huntercd> Pokémon at least digimon look human
[1:04:48] <HorribleHog> Por que no los dos?
[1:04:50] <+primax104> Digimon are basically SMT demons or Persona
[1:04:50] <adamisfruit> All of them
[1:04:51] <DandyMackeroos> Pokemon
[1:04:52] <RubberFistFight> Gardevoir exists, so Pokemon wins by default.
[1:04:53] <peachy996> At least Digifuckers can have a conversation with what they fuck
[1:04:53] <derap41> Pokemon fail the Harkness test Digimon Do not
[1:04:54] <%Coystick> DISPERSE the L E W D S
[1:04:57] <+Xeno351> most of the digimon are just people in cosplay
[1:04:57] <moore595> Just invite him up to the rooftop to give him a ham and cheese sandwhich then just gently push him off
[1:04:57] <+Konquerer> digimon can actually talk
[1:04:58] <%ElenaManetta> mrwoaw
[1:04:59] <+grim_abel> pokemon are animals so its worse
[1:04:59] <CrypticMochi> People in that world married pokemon so.....
[1:05:00] <%heyitsbrian> No one wins between pokemon or digimon in this argument
[1:05:01] <+Shadicara> Pokeporn is for the next level degenerates Kappa

[1:05:04] <peachy996> Have fun fucking your Machoke wo can only say his name
[1:05:05] <%WheatlyXT> the Pokemon fuckers are only okay if it stays with the actual Pokegirls
[1:05:05] <Animorphimagi> Digimon are intelligent
[1:05:06] <%SvenHolgersson> Digimon are intelligent and can talk people words theyre more fuckable
[1:05:06] <NekoUrabe> KonCha
[1:05:07] <+WhereIsWill> I'd bang a Digimon waay b4 a Pokémon
[1:05:08] <+Gondab> Lucario<3
[1:05:09] <%mighty_max_t> Digimon can talk. Pokemon can't. That alone makes Pokefuckers worse
[1:05:14] <%WheatlyXT> anything else is degeneracy
[1:05:15] <jerkhov_> that video got recommended recently
[1:05:18] <Storm_Samurai> Those aren’t monsters at all
[1:05:18] <+ArtoriasTheTrenchfighter> No you wouldn't you liar! You hate your bodily functions, you could never poop on yourself on purpose. Also the answer is obviously Pokemon.

[1:05:27] <Rojahh> Digimon is literally fucking your virtual waifu
[1:05:28] <%rumtumtugnutz> Digimon is already data, so its just like whacking it to porn if you fuck a digimon. Fucking pokemon is more degenerate-y.

[1:21:43] <trueherobappo> She's moaning..

[1:21:48] <DeathByGeek> doodStare
[1:21:48] <trueherobappo> and it's kinda weird..
[1:21:48] <Smaenus> I wonder if she just like dominates that one part where you have to do the electrical fuses
[1:21:48] <Aleate> ruuGasm
[1:21:49] <%Niney_Who> That was weird, oh well
[1:21:50] <%Coystick> Nemesis Haunting System might be amazing
[1:21:51] <ha2ken> It's her stand
[1:21:51] <%Breakfast_Megapowers> Stay calm and call the Police
[1:21:52] <antthefool> What is that invisible shit
[1:21:53] <$SirGO0SE> haha relatable
[1:21:54] <%ElenaManetta> Haha that was so weird how goofy
[1:21:56] <+TreeeFOX> Ay YAYAY
[1:21:56] <+Scevda> Different spooks for different chars. Very good.
[1:21:56] <%Divryne> !uptime
[1:21:58] <%SoFarFetched> PACHAMAMA
[1:21:59] <%JaydenSai> You know what, this reminds me of Haunting Ground @PeachSaliva
[1:21:59] <+Piemen99> WHERE THOSE EYES IN THE BACK?
[1:22:00] <jerkhov_> kono sutando nouryouku ga
[1:22:01] <+Shadicara> STANDO POWAH
[1:22:02] <%Breakfast_Megapowers> 911 surely can handle ghosts
[1:22:03] <sporeian94> PAIGE SHUT THEXBOX OFF RIGHT NOW!
[1:22:03] <SaltyBrim> New character, new creepies? Neat
[1:22:04] <Aleate> Does it?
[1:22:05] <+Dr_Mooose> this is when you leave the house
[1:22:06] <%Jekado> spooks everywhere system
[1:22:06] <%AncelDeLambert> I CoUlD cLimB UndER iT EasY!
[1:22:09] <@PlagueOfGripes> *hundreds of ghosts grab all over your body* "That was pretty weird!"
[1:22:10] <chattychocobo> THIS MUST BE THE WORK OF AN ENEMY STAND
[1:22:13] <%ElenaManetta> Can you see if the walkie talkie does anything in your inventory
[1:22:15] <+LanHikari64> jump out the window
[1:22:16] <EuropanLamprey> Paige escapes the ghost by casually walking away confused
[1:22:23] <%Lunarhawk> @PlagueOfGripes idk about you but I'd love to be groped by ghosts
[1:22:23] <MetroidSlayerP7> "Hey Mr ghost, I got a work ticket for a broken power breaker. Can you sign for this?"
[1:22:23] <+SolverCODO> There was nothing to hide from, just a spook
[1:22:25] <Aleate> The table is a hiding place. It has the hiding spot icon
[1:22:33] <%ElenaManetta> It just messes with your sanity if you stare at it, I guess
[1:22:33] <Zalthia> Ugh I had a really rough time at work
[1:22:40] <%SoFarFetched> Cause no monsters
[1:22:42] <Tampaoster> Every time you yawn a horny ghost sticks its dick in yo mouth
[1:22:43] <%ElenaManetta> I'm gonna guess this is one of those "if your sanity is low the monster appears"
[1:22:44] <%JaydenSai> Maybe you can only hide when you're in actual danger?
[1:22:47] <MyNameIsRasus> Kira Yoshikage as he was being dragged to hell: "THIS IS PRETTY WEIRD"
[1:22:48] <ValkyrieWarCry> The table is a hiding place
[1:22:50] <%Jekado> you can only hide if your actively being attacked by monsters
[1:22:52] <+LanHikari64> *yawn*
[1:22:57] <TurtlesAndTentacles> Paige...listen to the pat
[1:22:59] <ValkyrieWarCry> Be careful
[1:23:04] <danknugglit> Why are you in this house?

[1:23:19] <Aleate> ruuD
[1:23:20] <%SoFarFetched> @danknugglit she's playing as the electrician right now,so it's probably the missing family who called them.

[1:23:49] <+LanHikari64> she was dead the second you picked her
[1:23:50] <%WheatlyXT> Paige doesn't want to kill a lady? That's a first
[1:23:55] <Zalthia> How many characters have we gone through?
[1:24:00] <%SoFarFetched> She hasn't explored every room,she missed a few.
[1:24:04] <%JaydenSai> @Zalthia Just Sophie, so far
[1:24:06] <sharpington_> 1 character died so far
[1:24:09] <%ElenaManetta> You hear that evil?
[1:24:11] <%sleepy_coffee> The lady has a cool hat and hair
[1:24:16] <EuropanLamprey> As a perfect man once said "There's no point in being afraid of the inevitable"
[1:24:18] <zaptar13> That sounds like demons better hide
[1:24:19] <ValkyrieWarCry> The moldy room

[1:25:52] <+Shadicara> Wonder if she'll die by goo, ghost or pushed down the stairs Kappa
[1:25:52] <%Jekado> no you need wire
[1:25:55] <Sphincter_Spelunker> I looked away to watch FF7 trailers and now I'm lost
[1:25:58] <Arek_1> That was like a pantry?
[1:25:58] <TearDropBro> Gloo
[1:25:59] <+LanHikari64> pat wouldn't do drugs he wouldn't do that
[1:26:04] <MetroidSlayerP7> Grill up some ghost steaks
[1:26:06] <ha2ken> That Goo-B-Gone sure works wonders
[1:26:07] <mor3gan> damn hips

[1:26:31] <%SoFarFetched> Paige you could also try that garage cardoor button you got.
[1:26:32] <yourliteraldog> that room is full satans
[1:26:33] <sharpington_> Isn't she the maid/nanny?
[1:26:37] <+parrotman01> Oh hey, it's the beta version of RE4
[1:26:40] <$MeanMrBowman> Cheer200 You're my favorite Peach
[1:26:43] <ValkyrieWarCry> Maybe it's Catherine
[1:26:45] <ValkyrieWarCry> GET OUT OF THERE
[1:26:46] <MyNameIsRasus> Is that the PT bathroom?
[1:26:52] <+LanHikari64> you're my favorite deputy
[1:26:52] <%king_wragles> I don't know if it's the game, but I think I heard someone call me. Like my actual name and everything
[1:26:57] <+Shadicara> Spooky outside
[1:26:59] <%Jekado> no you need wire
[1:27:03] <%ElenaManetta> Oh
[1:27:06] <+LanHikari64> just jump the railing
[1:27:06] <%ElenaManetta> Thats nice flavor text for her
[1:27:08] <Aleate> What is with the battery and the tongs...
[1:27:12] <%ElenaManetta> That at least gives us some better idea, more than Sophie
[1:27:12] <$SirGO0SE> @LanHikari64 LUL
[1:27:13] <+Evil_John_Cena> apatDab apatDab apatDab apatDab
[1:27:16] <%SoFarFetched> Tjat
[1:27:17] <%Coystick> SILENT HILL
[1:27:21] <%SoFarFetched> that is probably the white noise you hear.
[1:27:21] <%Jekado> that might warn you about ghosts
[1:27:26] <Zaphire_Saucypants> doesn't have a number
[1:27:27] <42nfl19> take batteries
[1:27:28] <%Jekado> that might give you a ghost warner
[1:27:32] <MetroidSlayerP7> I like the different dialogue
[1:27:33] <%Lunarhawk> (passive)
[1:27:34] <Zaphire_Saucypants> and it's a passive. So probably not.
[1:27:38] <%Jekado> because remember the radios
[1:27:39] <+LanHikari64> i'm sure the monaters can hear it
[1:27:40] <%ElenaManetta> It doesnt have a number
[1:27:44] <%Jekado> so it might warn you if ghosts
[1:27:49] <%Coystick> Scented candles? Oh Sophie was one of THOSE ladies..
[1:27:50] <+Dr_Mooose> probably proximity based
[1:27:54] <%Niney_Who> IE "More time to Panic"
[1:27:55] <+MagicCalls> It's like Silent Hill
[1:27:57] <%ElenaManetta> it shouts "GHOST, BITCH"
[1:28:02] <oceanmatt> take the red herb
[1:28:08] <Zalthia> Ghosts don’t like scented candles?
[1:28:09] <$Mothman742> bruh who would ACTUALLY see one of these houses and goes "yeah this place doesnt look hauted AT ALL"
[1:28:19] <%Coystick> it shouts "GHOST, BITCH" in Gilbert Gottfried's voice
[1:28:19] <SpaceGuntank> honk
[1:28:26] <%SoFarFetched> @Zalthia each character has something to calm them down (for sanity),the woman before had scented candles.
[1:28:32] <MyNameIsRasus> When's Joe Baker gonna be added to the roster of this game?
[1:28:32] <+Shadicara> Remember the goo is weak to power bombs
[1:28:32] <yourliteraldog> goob
[1:28:42] <Zalthia> @sofarfetched ooohhhhhhhh that makes more sense
[1:28:42] <LiquidMathew> i think you need a cable for the battery to connect it
[1:28:45] <%sleepy_coffee> we all gangsta till the ghosts start staticking
[1:28:47] <%ElenaManetta> this whole house is spooky
[1:28:49] <MetroidSlayerP7> Ghost: "10-4 good buddy. I'll catch ya on the flip side. over and out."
[1:28:51] <+LanHikari64> what kind of hokum shenanigans are these things also this girl was dead the moment you put eyes on her
[1:28:53] <ValkyrieWarCry> the light is on now
[1:29:02] <ValkyrieWarCry> the green light is now

[1:29:04] <+Scevda> Heh i member @shadicara
[1:29:05] <%Lunarhawk> Just look for a dead horse, might be easier to find in this house than the already processed glue
[1:29:05] <Sphincter_Spelunker> senyorez
[1:29:15] <Zaphire_Saucypants> "Hahaha, I speak Spanish."

[1:30:12] <%Jekado> farfetch might be right you might have to go to the garage and try the door opener
[1:30:12] <$Mothman742> "hahaha yo hablo espanol"
[1:30:14] <Zaphire_Saucypants> @ElenaManetta I like both the solving and the "Oh yeah"
[1:30:23] <%depressed_skeleton> We keep hearing a ghost, its weird
[1:30:23] <$SirGO0SE> im bitchin about echo
[1:30:28] <yourliteraldog> use the babynut

[1:30:41] <%ElenaManetta> Pat's brave because he endured 7 years of shitstorms
[1:30:43] <Arek_1> You should turn down fourwat. Kappa
[1:30:47] <MetroidSlayerP7> It's very high in the spook meter
[1:30:50] <emillionghost> paige is right
[1:30:52] <%SoFarFetched> WOOD IS OP

[1:31:05] <Darkfire346> oh boy, Paige is streaming! I guess its time for women to die!
[1:31:14] <floralkami> those shower curtains aren't blessed
[1:31:15] <RubberFistFight> @PeachSaliva doesn't look like the curtains go all the way to the floor/shower pan, so your feet and ankles would still be visible.
[1:31:15] <%ElenaManetta> YEAHHHH
[1:31:16] <Zaphire_Saucypants> really? I though this was America.
[1:31:23] <%ElenaManetta> puzzles are getting solved now
[1:31:23] <sharpington_> The shower is extra bullshit because the curtains are closed for the first guy. The change implies they're important
[1:31:27] <$SirGO0SE> find a car its the only way to truly know
[1:31:29] <SpaceGuntank> did i just see a shadow of a person?
[1:31:32] <%Lunarhawk> oh my god its a CAR

[1:32:03] <%ElenaManetta> Did people mistake tongs for clamps?
[1:32:04] <ValkyrieWarCry> Be careful
[1:32:08] <Zaphire_Saucypants> I wonder if this character can do electrical stuff better. Like if she doesn't have to do certain puzzles?
[1:32:09] <42nfl19> is W101 the fastest backed kickstarter? it is at 1700% completion
[1:32:12] <SkyPirateArcane> I really like that this seems to be contained to a single location, the devs look like they polished it to hell and back
[1:32:12] <danknugglit> Perfect! Electricute the ghost
[1:32:13] <silverira> TAKE A DUMP ON THE DOORMAT AND LEAVE

[1:49:56] <%CommanderSqueaks> Peach, I told you that you'd die first in a horror movie, you have yet to prove me wrong. XD

[1:50:29] <$SirGO0SE> Alexander! You have no honor!

[1:51:06] <critiquequartz> did she kill the other women
[1:51:07] <%WheatlyXT> Will Alexander or Etienne ever see episode 2?
[1:51:09] <%JaydenSai> Wait, hang on, how will you get that girls items? Will those ghosts be gone? @PeachSaliva
[1:51:13] <%SoFarFetched> @critiquequartz yes
[1:51:13] <%ElenaManetta> So the others die, but Dan gets to live?
[1:51:13] <ChrustosKing> 1
[1:51:18] <$TIME_PUNCHER> He's 59, dude's dead of a heart attack before you start.
[1:51:18] <terribleusername> "is this the house where all the people disappeared?"
[1:51:20] <ha2ken> @critiquequartz Welcome back to the shitshow.
[1:51:21] <%Jekado> whats his gimick?
[1:51:21] <Aleate> I literally went into the other room, what did you do @PeachSaliva ?? ruuMad
[1:51:24] <MetroidSlayerP7> Daniel's boss must survive. His TPS reports are due Monday.
[1:51:26] <evbites> first scene turns out he hates himself and he kills himself via peanuts
[1:51:27] <APB_Harleqyn> Sooooo... if he dies we restarting fam?
[1:51:27] <SaltyBrim> Wait did Paige go into the door that had the QTE monster and died?
[1:51:28] <qo_op> now hes a sex skeleton
[1:51:31] <IceCubeMan99> @critiquequartz yeah
[1:51:33] <%SoFarFetched> yes
[1:51:35] <Sokumotanaka> So if they all die does the guy who killed jason come out with a gun and fight the demons?
[1:51:36] <OvaltineDream> Alcoholism is his gimmick
[1:51:37] <$SirGO0SE> e n h a n c e
[1:51:37] <%ShockzNDrawe> @ElenaManetta but how else will you be immersed if the game unless you make one tiny mistake and the game goes "you don't get to play with this character anymore"
[1:51:38] <evbites> no
[1:51:41] <Neo_Kaiser> Never leave the room when Paige is around, a woman might die.
[1:51:48] <%JaydenSai> Wait, hang on, how will you get that girls items? Will those ghosts be gone? @PeachSaliva
[1:51:51] <+OrangePancake20> So I heard Paige got really high and was in danger. Is everything alright?
[1:51:53] <peachy996> You basically died from a cheap jump scare
[1:51:54] <Sphincter_Spelunker> easy mode was already unlocked
[1:51:55] <Zalthia> That’s so dumb
[1:52:02] <sadolerlaqreet1> Do the dead characters become ghosts?
[1:52:04] <%ElenaManetta> listen i play dont starve, i love permadeath
[1:52:05] <%CommanderSqueaks> Survey says yes.
[1:52:06] <%SoFarFetched> @JaydenSai When a character dies,their items get dropped in the house for the next character to pick up.
[1:52:10] <zenith0111> @aleate As supposed to metaphorically walking into the next room Kappa
[1:52:12] <sharpington_> huh I didn't notice any visual cues
[1:52:12] <%ElenaManetta> permadeath drives me to KEEP TRYING!!!!
[1:52:18] <%nofestu2> easy modo
[1:52:19] <yourliteraldog> turn on vibration
[1:52:20] <energywarning> dante must listen mode
[1:52:20] <%SoFarFetched> He's the servants husband.
[1:52:21] <%WheatlyXT> she needs the visual cue because she is big handicapped
[1:52:23] <ha2ken> @sadolerlaqreet1 No. They become angels.
[1:52:30] <QaizerArt> Restart the game for the Visual Cues to take effect.
[1:52:32] <terribleusername> why is the rum gone?
[1:52:34] <Zaphire_Saucypants> Depending on the game, permadeath is okay. Not my favorite mechanic but I can live with it.
[1:52:35] <Zalthia> Unless they were supposed to die
[1:52:36] <%WheatlyXT> The alarm
[1:52:37] <%WheatlyXT> wait
[1:52:37] <EndlessScrapper> I appreciate Markkipliers determination in Until Dawn when he restarted a game he was over 3 hours in just to save one character he foolishly got killed
[1:52:38] <+Jaysky> Baba is Scare
[1:52:39] <%ElenaManetta> How come only Alina had an alarm to deal with
[1:52:39] <%WheatlyXT> is it dead?
[1:52:42] <%Jekado> second floor in the goo room
[1:52:43] <$SirGO0SE> retrieve blood echoes
[1:52:46] <%JaydenSai> @SoFarFetched Well yes, but in the same room? What if the ghosts are still there?
[1:52:47] <$TIME_PUNCHER> Paige is like some union between The Wiz and Pippi Longstocking, directed by Kevin Smith
[1:52:48] <%ssjklyco> why did he just walk in?
[1:53:01] <yourliteraldog> goo
[1:53:03] <Zaphire_Saucypants> @ElenaManetta She already dealt with the alarm and it burnt out.
[1:53:04] <%SoFarFetched> @JaydenSai I assume it's nearby instead of in the room you die if it's like a for sure death area.
[1:53:06] <QaizerArt> Paige you won't see the visual cues unless you restart the game
[1:53:06] <MayorRev> kamrade
[1:53:08] <Ner234> oof
[1:53:09] <%ShockzNDrawe> cuz the ghost broke the alarm
[1:53:11] <Parapattern> A nip for courage
[1:53:13] <%K2YP70C0CK> noice flask
[1:53:14] <%ElenaManetta> But Sophie didnt have to deal with it
[1:53:14] <QaizerArt> It literally said that as you were turning it on
[1:53:15] <%ssjklyco> you probably find more
[1:53:17] <%ElenaManetta> Or did Paige turn it off
[1:53:18] <energywarning> right now
[1:53:18] <$SirGO0SE> always
[1:53:18] <zenith0111> We all go quiet here... atpShh
[1:53:19] <%ShockzNDrawe> yeah but shut up though
[1:53:19] <%ElenaManetta> as Sophie
[1:53:20] <%SoFarFetched> When your sanity is fucked.
[1:53:20] <peachy996> Put the goo in the flask
[1:53:23] <SpaceGuntank> gool ol' liquid courage
[1:53:25] <terribleusername> drink your problems away
[1:53:26] <Zaphire_Saucypants> @ElenaManetta Probably cuz the power was off then.
[1:53:26] <RubberFistFight> "do you still hear the screams clarice..."
[1:53:28] <%JaydenSai> @PeachSaliva Apparently you need to restart for the visual cues? I dunno
[1:53:33] <%ElenaManetta> oh yeaaaah
[1:53:34] <%JaydenSai> I just work here
[1:53:37] <Zalthia> @peachsaliva Apparently you need to reset the game for visual cues to start working
[1:53:38] <Arek_1> @PeachSaliva Yeah, but what did the description say? LUL
[1:53:41] <$TIME_PUNCHER> Go find your corpse
[1:53:56] <+SolverCODO> collect your souls
[1:53:57] <QaizerArt> It LITERALLY said it when it was being turned on, Pat!
[1:54:02] <%ShockzNDrawe> I mean sure but then why is the power off for all 3 of these guys then
[1:54:07] <%ShockzNDrawe> like thats weird
[1:54:08] <sharpington_> It would be super cool if you found the previous characters in the house or with the first dude
[1:54:10] <%Niney_Who> Now go i nthe room again Kappa
[1:54:16] <%CantWalkGood> yeah it said it for visual cues
[1:54:16] <terribleusername> ah, the items of two dead women
[1:54:17] <ha2ken> Just test it to be sure. Kappa
[1:54:18] <$TIME_PUNCHER> The Corps. under the bed
[1:54:18] <%CommanderSqueaks> We have to accept that the game gave Peach every chance and the bumble still ensued.
[1:54:27] <Zalthia> Or you could reset just in case Pat is wrong?
[1:54:28] <$SirGO0SE> the door whisperer
[1:54:34] <yourliteraldog> yeah evil
[1:54:34] <%SoFarFetched> yes still death
[1:54:37] <%Lunarhawk> Open the door paige dont be a coward
[1:54:39] <%SoFarFetched> Paige you should solve the Key thing.
[1:54:40] <$TIME_PUNCHER> DO IT
[1:54:40] <%Lunarhawk> maybe youll see Alina inside
[1:54:40] <QaizerArt> Nah wait Pat's right I'm a dumbass.
[1:54:41] <%isolex_> where are the icons?
[1:54:41] <yourliteraldog> sounds of evil
[1:54:42] <Arek_1> The rest of your stuff was in that room. Kappa
[1:54:44] <terribleusername> check it out for science
[1:54:45] <%ssjklyco> go in
[1:54:49] <danknugglit> Coward
[1:54:50] <%isolex_> i don't see the icons they were talking about
[1:54:51] <SpaceGuntank> Dont Dead Open Inside
[1:54:53] <zedravan> is the visual cue, the darkness?
[1:54:54] <absolute_cagemony> Hi everyone is Paige doing a big weed?
[1:54:55] <$SirGO0SE> maybe they used a ghost phone huh
[1:54:58] <%SoFarFetched> Paige glue for key.
[1:55:03] <+MoralCompassGaming> Ghost callers, liek in that movie, One Missed Call
[1:55:05] <%ElenaManetta> Thats fine too
[1:55:05] <$TIME_PUNCHER> You could save her. you should totally go in
[1:55:06] <Zaphire_Saucypants> maybe we have to solve the dollhouse puzzle and the door won't have spooks behind it? @PeachSaliva
[1:55:08] <%ElenaManetta> Glue or servants quarters
[1:55:09] <Zalthia> I don’t see the visual cue
[1:55:12] <absolute_cagemony> Did Pat get her out of the ditch all right?
[1:55:14] <%ShockzNDrawe> Paige I think the point of the mechanic is that if you hear ANYTHING you shouldn't touch that door AT ALL.
[1:55:15] <%Niney_Who> If you're about to die just spray goo all over yourself
[1:55:18] <%CommanderSqueaks> I think the visual cue is that evil black moss shit that covers the doors?
[1:55:18] <+alseif5633> Key thing first
[1:55:23] <%WheatlyXT> I forgot about poop doll
[1:55:23] <+Kairi__> it's not a trick - you can trust me
[1:55:31] <%ElenaManetta> paige is getting the horror eye
[1:55:31] <$TIME_PUNCHER> She had the glue. Gotta loot your old corpse
[1:55:32] <jerkhov_> I was gone for like 30 minutes did other girl already die? NotLikeThis
[1:55:38] <yourliteraldog> poop
[1:55:38] <zenith0111> sipsipElmo Let me eat it
[1:55:39] <DracaenaLeaf> Wind is fine to hear
[1:55:40] <%Jekado> spores invade
[1:55:40] <%ShockzNDrawe> cuz ghosts n shit
[1:55:43] <%ElenaManetta> unless you hear an awesome rave
[1:55:46] <%ElenaManetta> then you should bareg through
[1:55:46] <%WheatlyXT> boy doll, girl doll, and poop doll
[1:55:47] <Zaphire_Saucypants> @jerkhov_ dead as fuck.
[1:55:48] <%JaydenSai> @jerkhov_ Yup! Ghosts ate her
[1:55:50] <absolute_cagemony> Does this game have shadow puzzles?
[1:55:53] <@commanderclaw> "I heard a child crying in this haunted house, so clearly I went to help them"
[1:56:06] <%CommanderSqueaks> @commanderclaw How could that possibly go wrong?
[1:56:07] <jerkhov_> stupid zombie ghosts
[1:56:11] <$Dotta5> the kush amplify Paige big brute smartness
[1:56:13] <%ShockzNDrawe> Ghost Rave
[1:56:13] <%Niney_Who> so kind of Paige to sacrifice that lady to feed those ghost kids
[1:56:14] <%ElenaManetta> to be fair, Sophie did say "I MUST FIND ZEE CHILD"
[1:56:23] <lunacys_straightjacket> he has a weird ass
[1:56:24] <absolute_cagemony> If you ever hear a child just make a bee line in the opposite direction, haunted house or no
[1:56:30] <$SirGO0SE> that was a weird sound
[1:56:34] <terribleusername> that doesn't look like half a key
[1:56:49] <%Lunarhawk> Sounds of Dead Women
[1:56:50] <Sphincter_Spelunker> is that one of them old timey cartoon jail keys?
[1:56:50] <Zaphire_Saucypants> sounds good to me
[1:56:51] <$TIME_PUNCHER> "Which room do I enter, the crying child room, the quiet room or the room with the bass guitar-heavy porn track playing?"
[1:56:58] <$TIME_PUNCHER> Decisions
[1:57:04] <%Jekado> hook for the film room
[1:57:05] <yourliteraldog> hook
[1:57:07] <Zaphire_Saucypants> expandable, huh?
[1:57:13] <absolute_cagemony> If I can't eat it or sex it, what's the point
[1:57:13] <%Lunarhawk> the hook man cometh
[1:57:15] <zenith0111> Hookman PogChamp
[1:57:16] <%ElenaManetta> like, the royal we?
[1:57:17] <+lucaflow> Bet's on paige getting a game over?
[1:57:18] <+windsoc> man hook hand hook attic door
[1:57:23] <%goatbait> Expand Hook
[1:57:25] <+wmeldrum> what's good beeple
[1:57:30] <$TIME_PUNCHER> Hey Paige, was that the PLOT HOOK?
[1:57:31] <%maskofmichael> Surely there are no ghost in the attic
[1:57:39] <+Jaysky> Listen to it.
[1:57:40] <zenith0111> DON'T LISTEN TO MUSIC
[1:57:51] <Parapattern> Why does it look like it was pinned in 1798?
[1:57:57] <jerkhov_> Just shazam it bro
[1:58:01] <Sphincter_Spelunker> the hiss
[1:58:02] <derap41> Banana Phone!
[1:58:03] <+wmeldrum> Baaabee SHARK
[1:58:08] <%Coystick> Spooky
[1:58:08] <%ElenaManetta> Imagine cursing your friend by accident with horror
[1:58:09] <$TIME_PUNCHER> It's a memetic virus.
[1:58:10] <$Gr4ndm4rsh4ll> ...is the music box an SCP?
[1:58:12] <silverira> music box SCP
[1:58:15] <+Jaysky> It's Baby Shark isn't it?
[1:58:17] <derap41> Ring ring ring ring ring ring banana phone
[1:58:18] <Animorphimagi> Sounds normal to me
[1:58:18] <%Jekado> OH look at "the don't look" picture again! see if it changed!
[1:58:19] <%SoFarFetched> @ElenaManetta "Oops all horror"
[1:58:19] <ha2ken> Time to listen to moozik bawks...
[1:58:21] <$Dotta5> It's filled with Carona
[1:58:25] <sleepycorpse> Look at the picture again
[1:58:27] <MicrotonalMatt> It’s finger family
[1:58:27] <%ssjklyco> Don't forget to look at the picture that said do not look.
[1:58:37] <derap41> dingdong dingdong dingdong ding banana phonee!
[1:58:43] <Sphincter_Spelunker> the music has the corona virus in it? @Dotta5 LUL
[1:58:45] <%ElenaManetta> I never saw an attic
[1:58:45] <$TIME_PUNCHER> If you play the music box backwards, people say you'll hear Justin Bieber
[1:58:45] <silverira> Class-"Euclid"
[1:58:47] <%WheatlyXT> servant's quaters
[1:58:50] <%ElenaManetta> Where the heck is the attic
[1:58:51] <%SoFarFetched> wasn't there 5 dolls?
[1:58:52] <derap41> I've got this feeling abudtish its so apealing
[1:58:53] <%WheatlyXT> because attic is too spooky for me
[1:58:58] <Zaphire_Saucypants> maybe solve the dollhouse and the ghosts in that room go away?
[1:59:00] <%CommanderSqueaks> Attic is the second evilist place in any house.

[2:04:12] <Torpedo_Daddy> Watching the door while the girl was reading!
[2:04:15] <zedravan> examine dolls? i think sophie said one looked skinny
[2:04:15] <QaizerArt> @PeachSaliva Inspecting the dolls gives you a hint about where they go. You've seen the hints before.
[2:04:27] <%WheatlyXT> lights are kinda flickering
[2:04:29] <%SoFarFetched> It is
[2:04:34] <absolute_cagemony> revelations 2 was okay.. it didn't have Jill's huge butt tho

[2:05:05] <%WheatlyXT> spooky
[2:05:07] <$TIME_PUNCHER> This feels like Supernatural plot crossed over with Days of Our Lives

[2:08:14] <Zalthia> To cope with horror I try to think of it as sad that the people died. I’m not sure that makes it better though, because then I get depressed.

[2:14:31] <MicrotonalMatt> 4444
[2:14:32] <%Breakfast_Megapowers> Let them ALL die
[2:14:33] <ha2ken> No discrimination here.
[2:14:33] <%ElenaManetta> I kind of like that some of these objects just kill you instantly, even if some people think it's cheap.
[2:14:34] <%isolex_> GIVE HIM A WARRIORS DEATH
[2:14:34] <%Lunarhawk> @PeachSaliva JUST DO IT GOOD
[2:14:34] <%K2YP70C0CK> woolieYE

[2:14:39] <devanmuse> Double, Triple, and Quadruple down!!!
[2:14:39] <%zorak100229> 1
[2:14:40] <+Dr_Mooose> gotta finish the job
[2:14:41] <Sokumotanaka> may as well go for broke
[2:14:44] <Zalthia> 2
[2:14:44] <+Vithaeria> yeah play with him and if he dies you can reset with all of them
[2:14:46] <+Vithaeria> exatly
[2:14:46] <%ElenaManetta> It feels liek a classic point and click adventure game when you just FUCKING DIE after clicking the wrong thing
[2:14:47] <Animorphimagi> Get info
[2:14:47] <+RealThiele> famous last words
[2:14:48] <%WheatlyXT> I wonder if you did the drink first you could've put your hand in the sink?
[2:14:49] <Laecerelius> You’ll kill him off quickly enough
[2:14:50] <lycandruid> pull a pat once you shit the floor you might as well smear it
[2:14:57] <%CommanderSqueaks> IT WAS EVIL GOO WATER
[2:14:58] <+mixedelirium> Try doing it without dying
[2:14:58] <Mister_McDerp> death is easy
[2:14:59] <%SoFarFetched> IT WAS PATS
[2:15:00] <Zalthia> You get more characters next episode
[2:15:03] <%CommanderSqueaks> It was evil oil
[2:15:04] <+AcrutaLao> Use Wakandan technology to banish the great evils
[2:15:05] <$TIME_PUNCHER> @peachsaliva You've already killed three people, what's one more?
[2:15:07] <GraceTBM> it's just incidental to curiosity
[2:15:08] <+Vithaeria> pat you monster
[2:15:11] <%ssjklyco> It was black water
[2:15:11] <ha2ken> Etienne gets buff "filled with determination"
[2:15:12] <$Bane_Kaikyo> I looked away, did she suddenly die again?
[2:15:13] <%ElenaManetta> It's nice that there is some danger in clickables vs. just the monster
[2:15:14] <+cvp5127> vored
[2:15:14] <+D00msDayDan> that was also like the most obvious "yo this shit will kill you" it could have been
[2:15:18] <%maskofmichael> Die, then make Pat play
[2:15:18] <%ShockzNDrawe> So I guess just don't interact with ANYTHING EVEN REMOTELY EVIL LOOKING
[2:15:21] <@Calek> @Bane_Kaikyo sure did
[2:15:22] <%SoFarFetched> Yeah you need to survive with people
[2:15:25] <lycandruid> sipsipGasm best emote
[2:15:34] <%ShockzNDrawe> because this seems to be a game that isn't gonna try to subvert your expectations
[2:15:34] <lycandruid> sipsipGasm sipsipGasm sipsipGasm sipsipGasm sipsipGasm sipsipGasm sipsipGasm
[2:15:36] <$Bane_Kaikyo> @calek dang
[2:15:44] <+alseif5633> servsnt quarters
[2:15:44] <%SoFarFetched> yes
[2:15:45] <Zaphire_Saucypants> past garage
[2:15:46] <%SoFarFetched> near ther
[2:15:47] <%ShockzNDrawe> shit is exactly how it looks
[2:15:59] <+AcrutaLao> Just remember... don't act dumb.
[2:16:01] <$TIME_PUNCHER> You know, he kinda looks like Reggie...
[2:16:02] <%ElenaManetta> It was definitely an obvious "gonna kill you" interactable because it was black like the goo, but I also wanted to see Paige gamble and see me be wrong
[2:16:02] <+Vithaeria> why are all of them coming to this house anyway
[2:16:12] <%WheatlyXT> Hints?
[2:16:18] <%SoFarFetched> He probably helps let you know what to do next.
[2:16:21] <%WheatlyXT> Paige that's racist
[2:16:23] <+D00msDayDan> yeah so the black guy can die first
[2:16:28] <Sokumotanaka> It kinda seems like RNG kills happen alot, like you can walk through a door and get offed no matter which door you pick or if a monster attacks you all doors are suddenly locked.
[2:16:29] <@commanderclaw> Obviously, he's black
[2:16:33] <+WhereIsWill> that lighter would be HOT AF
[2:16:41] <TheImmortal70> I would say that either etienne or alena are first since one has a danger meter and one is a puzzle helper
[2:16:45] <%CommanderSqueaks> @Sokumotanaka How is evil goo water and haunted baby crying RNG?
[2:16:48] <Valdorick> Needs to be the first character to die, huh?
[2:16:50] <+mugwugsampoo> cmonBruh
[2:16:51] <%Lunarhawk> I also write things down when I'm black
[2:16:53] <TurtlesAndTentacles> Of course the Brother writes stuff down
[2:16:55] <%K2YP70C0CK> atpCarl
[2:16:58] <Mister_McDerp> the only literate character
[2:16:58] <%mighty_max_t> right now?
[2:16:58] <%ElenaManetta> So what else to do now
[2:17:00] <+AcrutaLao> Smart man
[2:17:03] <+cereal_box_conspiracy> that sounds really awful if you don't know you're responding to chat
[2:17:05] <$TIME_PUNCHER> OH I SEE, he should die first because he's a nerd?? Nice, Paige
[2:17:16] <+AcrutaLao> See, if you hide in the darkness the evil can't find you
[2:17:22] <Sphincter_Spelunker> My name's George, and I'm the leader of the bunch
[2:17:26] <Zaphire_Saucypants> check the towel at least?
[2:17:27] <Arek_1> doodHokey
[2:17:30] <Sokumotanaka> @CommanderSqueaks You're experience in watchign paige is different from my own is what I can tell you
[2:17:35] <juxtest> Surely it couldn't happen again
[2:17:37] <+MagicCalls> Hi Pat I love you

[2:17:43] <%WheatlyXT> now you know for the next time

[2:17:46] <malletman241> but youll watch my dogshit academia
[2:17:46] <%ElenaManetta> It was JUST a death trap?
[2:17:47] <BakaAkaKeri> minidenKappa first to die?
[2:17:47] <sleepycorpse> Ha
[2:17:48] <metalwater8> Holy shit Paige got Alex killed
[2:17:48] <+paladinstarbuster> It was bait
[2:17:49] <Mister_McDerp> died for nothing!
[2:17:49] <%CommanderSqueaks> YES
[2:17:49] <+Brythildir> not even anything in it LUL
[2:17:49] <%ShockzNDrawe> yeah
[2:17:50] <QaizerArt> Are you FUCKING kidding? It's just a death trap?
[2:17:53] <%JaydenSai> Hey you drained the tub! And there was no object! Worth it @PeachSaliva
[2:17:54] <%CommanderSqueaks> It was only ever death
[2:17:54] <ralzonfleur> Peach distract me from politics
[2:17:55] <Zaphire_Saucypants> durn
[2:17:55] <QaizerArt> Man that's bullshit.
[2:17:56] <TopTierHarley> told you not to
[2:17:56] <%SoFarFetched> Paige you now have like attic and fireplace LUL
[2:17:59] <%ElenaManetta> WAY TO GO, pAT
[2:18:00] <%CommanderSqueaks> It's EVIL OIL WATER of COURSE IT IS
[2:18:02] <+RealThiele> this feels like a sierra adventure game
[2:18:03] <silverira> How nice of Alexander leave his things for you after he died @PeachSaliva
[2:18:07] <TurtlesAndTentacles> paige dont get the black man killed
[2:18:07] <%ssjklyco> Where was Elena with the guide
[2:18:08] <%ElenaManetta> "THERE'S CLEARLY a DOLL IN THERE, PAIGE"
[2:18:09] <Sphincter_Spelunker> Would've been cool to sacrifice characters for progression items
[2:18:10] <%maskofmichael> Please don't let Idris Elba die Page
[2:18:10] <Mister_McDerp> never listen to pat
[2:18:16] <%CommanderSqueaks> @ElenaManetta Clearly.
[2:18:26] <+mixedelirium> Bathtub is just there to troll Resident Evil fans
[2:18:31] <Aleate> Paige is pleased ruuGasm
[2:18:31] <BakaAkaKeri> sipsipGasm pleased
[2:18:32] <lycandruid> never listen to pat but always listen to pat
[2:18:33] <%CommanderSqueaks> Peach, just remember, do the exact opposite of whatever Pat says.
[2:18:33] <$TIME_PUNCHER> I guess you could say Alexander experienced Death Grips
[2:18:33] <%walternatorz> light the bonfire
[2:18:34] <%SoFarFetched> you placed it .
[2:18:35] <%JaydenSai> Fireplace @PeachSaliva
[2:18:37] <Zaphire_Saucypants> Thing is I actually like the old point and click Sierra games, but they typically had a save/load feature.
[2:18:39] <peachy996> Etienne sounds like a girl's name so he's done in 10 minutes
[2:18:48] <Zaphire_Saucypants> No permadeath
[2:18:49] <%WheatlyXT> "where is the ugly doll"
[2:18:50] <QaizerArt> Oh so YOU DID get a doll
[2:18:56] <%CantWalkGood> TEEN GIRL SQUAD!
[2:18:57] <SaltyDongs> smoke weed
[2:18:58] <+Andrizzleton> Etienne is french version of Steven
[2:18:59] <+cvp5127> speedrun
[2:18:59] <QaizerArt> But you HAD TO FUCKING KILL A CHARACTER TO GET IT
[2:19:01] <energywarning> they didn't stand a chance
[2:19:07] <Sokumotanaka> @CommanderSqueaks What I'll say is I've been attacked and doors that weren't locked were suddenly closed. with zero hiding places at times and sometimes it be fine until I opened a random door so I think it's probably rng to some degree
[2:19:10] <Sphincter_Spelunker> Mmmmmm meeeeee
[2:19:10] <%Jekado> ghost speed run strat
[2:19:14] <%ssjklyco> Now would be a good time to drink from the flask
[2:19:16] <$TIME_PUNCHER> So... why not just burn the house down. just sayin
[2:19:19] <%WheatlyXT> why light the fire?
[2:19:19] <+WhereIsWill> the women died swiftly and without mercy 1st
[2:19:21] <%nofestu2> pat should play this
[2:19:25] <%ElenaManetta> pat's just a babynut in the head
[2:19:26] <Paperware> Pat would probably get them killed even faster
[2:19:32] <$Dotta5> dat donk
[2:19:33] <%Lunarhawk> Throw the dolls on the fire
[2:19:34] <peachy996> @TIME_PUNCHER Not a good idea if you ever saw the Grudge
[2:19:36] <%SoFarFetched> right side
[2:19:37] <%ElenaManetta> BURN THE HAIKUs
[2:19:37] <%ShockzNDrawe> I like that when Pat realizes when he says or does something stupid he defaults to "yeah im so smart you guys"
[2:19:37] <%Naotox10> WAIT WHAT THE FUCK, I LOOK AWAY FOR A MINUTE AND ANOTHER CHARACTER IS BEING PLAYED????
[2:19:38] <%ElenaManetta> IT IS TIME
[2:19:40] <%CommanderSqueaks> @Sokumotanaka How many of those doors did you not listen to first?
[2:19:41] <$TIME_PUNCHER> BOOM, gas leak
[2:19:42] <+Konquerer> when do you get to play as the monsters
[2:19:42] <%WheatlyXT> is babynut like babyface?
[2:19:43] <lunacys_straightjacket> hug ass
[2:19:45] <Sphincter_Spelunker> @TIME_PUNCHER Japanese ghosts follow people. I imagine same rules
[2:19:45] <TomFrank> are you trying to kill the ghost or just annoy it by turning lights on?
[2:19:47] <Mister_McDerp> fire good!
[2:19:49] <+Vithaeria> burn the entire house and run away
[2:19:58] <$TIME_PUNCHER> oh deer
[2:20:01] <%zorak100229> Pat has the big brain
[2:20:03] <Zaphire_Saucypants> I guess we need to burn something?
[2:20:03] <+Konquerer> now stick your hand in it
[2:20:04] <%SoFarFetched> Now you got attic time
[2:20:05] <Aleate> Cool. I am glad we burned that Haiku for that ruuBaka
[2:20:06] <snowmuttplays> Ah, I see Paige is playing a male character tonight
[2:20:08] <Mister_McDerp> ghosts HATE fire!
[2:20:09] <Zalthia> No burning the house will just light the ghosts on fire
[2:20:10] <+RealThiele> this is the dumb ghost cause it has paige assigned to him so he can pass his exam
[2:20:10] <Sokumotanaka> @CommanderSqueaks I listened to them all, thanks for being presumptuous XD
[2:20:12] <snowmuttplays> He may surivive to the end!
[2:20:15] <silverira> @PeachSaliva look at your notes
[2:20:17] <Zaphire_Saucypants> guess its time for the attic
[2:20:17] <+mixedelirium> burn the haikus again!
[2:20:18] <@commanderclaw> Play Moonlight Sonata!
[2:20:19] <ha2ken> RE save room found

[2:20:30] <%CommanderSqueaks> @Sokumotanaka Just asking, but you're welcome none the less!
[2:20:34] <snowmuttplays> Wait what
[2:20:35] <%Lunarhawk> @PeachSaliva The fire is gonna boil the attic water that ate Aleksander and let you get the doll
[2:20:36] <Aleate> @snowmuttplays she already killed both the women and that other guy so

[2:20:37] <letjaeeol> sbfpRichard

[2:21:18] <Zaphire_Saucypants> is Pat coming down from his high?
[2:21:23] <%ElenaManetta> Does anyone know if Paige can go downstairs and turn the lights back on at the fusebox?
[2:21:29] <%ElenaManetta> Or did the lights die with Sophie?
[2:21:37] <+RealThiele> sophie like 5 minutes ago
[2:21:38] <Sokumotanaka> @CommanderSqueaks Ah doubling down, cute. 9_9 Anyway I think it can be a factor not saying it's bad but I can see why it would be semi difficult for some.
[2:21:45] <MassConnect> older than the hills? did they get hill implants?
[2:21:47] <%SoFarFetched> @ElenaManetta that puzzles completely solved.
[2:21:52] <+Creggamonsta> frankh1Thug

[2:45:07] <+gespenst25> Paige is that your heartbeat?
[2:45:07] <+Di0nin> That just means you're outside the terror radius
[2:45:08] <hntronium> I am the deaf and do not hear it
[2:45:11] <Torpedo_Daddy> Not the whole time.
[2:45:11] <%spiritofmojave> uh oh

[2:45:17] <%SoFarFetched> Paige, the kitchen.
[2:45:17] <%CommanderSqueaks> F for Pat's ears.
[2:45:18] <%ElenaManetta> Pat doesn't know what a heartbeat sounds like cause he doesnt have one
[2:45:18] <d00med_magus> this just in pat has no heart
[2:45:22] <$TIME_PUNCHER> Heartbeats represent mortality, and therefore existential dread. Ignore that shit
[2:45:23] <TurtlesAndTentacles> so she's blind and he's deaf
[2:45:23] <%ssjklyco> No
[2:45:23] <Mister_McDerp> pat's heart is still and dead

[2:45:58] <TheImmortal70> The music is also angry
[2:45:58] <Neo_Kaiser> Pat doesn't have a heart beat cause he drank so much Redbull.
[2:45:59] <Torpedo_Daddy> The room with the creepy sound is were the ugly one is, and you should obvi go there last.
