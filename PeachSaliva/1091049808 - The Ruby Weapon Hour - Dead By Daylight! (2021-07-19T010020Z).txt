[0:13:08] <freelancebabymaker> you are both weird freaks
[0:13:08] <T_Sasquatch> Milk is weird but normal
[0:13:09] <KeiganOfAstora> The milk is fine
[0:13:09] <+superbla25> milk is fine
[0:13:11] <%Zineta> I mean milk is normal
[0:13:12] <+KingKrampus> quick question what is "hurty sand"
[0:13:13] <KeiganOfAstora> Sugar is bad for you
[0:13:13] <%EyeFarted> IT'S YOU PAIGE
[0:13:13] <%YakumoYomi> Milk has nutritional value
[0:13:16] <WickedTwizzler> MILK IS FOR CHILDREN
[0:13:16] <%AncelDeLambert> milk help the tummy calm down
[0:13:17] <+ausl0> "2 shots of vodka"
[0:13:17] <$Sphincter_Spelunker> atpCap
[0:13:18] <whittacre> milk is normal
[0:13:19] <+WackyGear> milk is normal
[0:13:20] <+chuckyswiss> smoke da wheed?
[0:13:20] <Faustgesicht> Full fat milk you can burn off
[0:13:20] <KeiganOfAstora> Yes it is
[0:13:20] <%peyodogo> milk is nice
[0:13:21] <wolfen091> warm milk is normal
[0:13:22] <xcompleasedad> Milk is a literal stereotype
[0:13:22] <%vVAstrAVv> milk helps you sleep better than SUGAR
[0:13:22] <%dankjerri> SUGAR EATS YOUR BONES
[0:13:23] <KeiganOfAstora> Milk is very normal
[0:13:23] <%Mr_Pylon> Milk is normal, the Dairy Farmers of Canada told me so.
[0:13:24] <%patriotrenegade> HURTY SAND NIGHT SNACK
[0:13:24] <%Dakuu75> Do you have casts for your Vtuber model, like that BRB animation with the sonic music~?
[0:13:24] <Coystick> Milk is absolutely fine
[0:13:24] <%Bt_Robot> Milk's how some people go to sleep
[0:13:25] <KeiganOfAstora> Doesn't matter
[0:13:28] <%AncelDeLambert> PAIGE
[0:13:28] <+moistborne> just drink water like real people
[0:13:33] <%dankjerri> peach
[0:13:33] <%patriotrenegade> Yeah, thats fine
[0:13:35] <KeiganOfAstora> Pat doesn't care about calories lol
[0:13:35] <+WackyGear> grown men can drink milk
[0:13:35] <thedoodynator3000> Would it be better if it was WARM!?!
[0:13:35] <%dankjerri> pleazw
[0:13:36] <shieldecho> Paige would you stop eating hurty sand I'm worried about your teeth I am missing so many and I don't want you to end up like me
[0:13:37] <%ssjklyco> Milk is supposed to be cold
[0:13:38] <T_Sasquatch> Milk without any sugar. Yuck
[0:13:39] <+Lunarhawk> yours is weirder
[0:13:41] <%patriotrenegade> Its yours
[0:13:41] <wolfen091> a spoon full of sugar helps the medicine go down
[0:13:43] <ZegarWildheart> It helps the medicine go down tho!
[0:13:44] <DianaTheAscian> your both insane
[0:13:44] <%bassoontyphoon> Calories yes, but also calcium and vit D
[0:13:45] <MrNoobMcSalt> what's fucked about Cold milk specifically
[0:13:46] <Fennrir28> Both are weird. Then again, I usually have a little spoon of ice cream most nights, so... not my place to talk haha
[0:13:47] <Faustgesicht> Milk has other stuff the sugar in it
[0:13:49] <+itsamedriggonny> maybe if pat drinks milk he'll grow up to be big and strong
[0:13:50] <@MelBrooksKA> Milk is completely normal, you are somehow the weirdo when talking about Pat's habits
[0:13:51] <%Fooguwu> Paige stop being V-Hot damn, it's getting beatoffable over here
[0:13:51] <KeiganOfAstora> He drinks energy drinks
[0:13:51] <$Sphincter_Spelunker> Lots of people warm up hurty sand in the microwave when they can't sleep
[0:13:52] <Coystick> Peach is very dry
[0:13:56] <%dankjerri> pats an orb, he cant be dehydrated

[0:47:30] <GabiTheMermaid> Feta is life
[0:47:31] <%dankjerri> feta in the calzone
[0:47:33] <Profmcstevie> As it turned out the easiest way to make me eat vegetables was to COOK THEM PROPERLY, my mom had a habit of annihilating dark greens
[0:47:34] <Vyskus> you ever crack open a tub of cottage cheese and just go to town
[0:47:35] <@commanderclaw> I love Goat Cheese, it's great in so many things

[0:48:26] <%kyh9> I've finaly figured out how to use Demogorgon
[0:48:28] <$Draylle> thot begone

[0:49:27] <Profmcstevie> Asparagus is a liar, how dare it look like green beans but not be green beans
[0:49:29] <Clundy> I love the stinky pee sticks
[0:49:30] <%dankjerri> asparagus RAW
[0:49:34] <GabiTheMermaid> I like asparagus but it makes my pee smell sus
[0:49:35] <karawra> now i'm getting hungry haha
[0:49:35] <%Jack_of_No_Trades> Broiled with a bit of olive oil, parmesan and pepper
[0:49:37] <TheBadoe> yum
[0:49:41] <+MooseIsGoose> I just do salt and pepper for those
[0:49:41] <%dankjerri> ive never cooked a vegetable, i only eat them raw
[0:49:42] <+itsamedriggonny> pls don't call them pee sticks
[0:49:56] <Setaro> Oooh, now I wanna roast some veggies
[0:50:01] <Wiiplayah43> slow-roast veggies with olive oil, slat, & pepper. Sometimes, simple is best
[0:50:06] <@commanderclaw> I usually save the grease when I make bacon and use that as my oil when I roast Brussel Sprouts
[0:50:08] <Noahccountingfortaste> true, wii
[0:50:11] <Wiiplayah43> *salt
[0:50:19] <%AncelDeLambert> I have, still not a fan
[0:50:20] <GabiTheMermaid> Fahhhck
[0:50:24] <%AncelDeLambert> I prefer brocollini
[0:50:24] <%ospreyworks> Any plans on doing another cooking stream in the future? I love hearing you talk about cooking and I've even tried a few new recipes because of you.
[0:50:29] <PartyFavors> Ye ye, roast them with olive oil and bacon and pecans
[0:50:30] <bevyrage> did peach just get substantially quiet for anyone else?

[0:50:45] <+shiokenstar> Roasted brussels da best
[0:50:48] <PartyFavors> Brussels sprouts and pecans are a great combo
[0:50:51] <freelancebabymaker> like someone said annabelle
[0:51:10] <Clundy> Cauliflower gang

[0:52:06] <%ssjklyco> I will chop up squash, brussel sprouts, squash, asparagus, stick them in bags of oil and seasoning, shake them to cover, put them in a tin and chop sausages in with it and cook it all in the oven.
[0:52:11] <%dankjerri> @freelancebabymaker oh, what if annabelle could hide in closets and get you when you hid
[0:52:16] <%ospreyworks> Everything can be improved with bacon or bacon fat
[0:52:17] <+shiokenstar> Whats your favorite food to get for take out?
[0:52:18] <kinetikpaws> simple is good makes for easy cooking
[0:52:25] <%dankjerri> and you get auto bamfed to a hook
[0:52:27] <+diegobandzz> Pat has a simple pallet
[0:52:27] <GabiTheMermaid> I roast a bunch of carrots, squash n potatoes in bulk for the week and it’s p good
[0:52:29] <Clundy> What’s your view of cilantro?

[0:52:35] <Profmcstevie> Pats butthole can't handle the food of India, pity
[0:52:40] <%Jack_of_No_Trades> Kind gesture, not blowing out Pats butt
[0:52:43] <@commanderclaw> There's always milder curries if his white body can't handle the heat
[0:52:51] <%dankjerri> his caucasoid form cannot handle the spice
[0:53:04] <+chuckyswiss> RUN
[0:53:06] <freelancebabymaker> @dankjerri i really havent seen many of those movies so i dont know fully how annabelle works
[0:53:10] <%VigilantShield> welp
[0:53:11] <%patriotrenegade> I'm definitely pickier than Pat, I've got this stupid "super-taster" gene where the taste and texture of everything is magnified so I loathe a lot of fruits and vegetables
[0:53:14] <+itsamedriggonny> wow
[0:53:21] <kinetikpaws> just don't make him choke on a bay leaf again that was funny though
[0:53:26] <+realm_forge> Paige once made chili that destroyed pat 3 times during me of the mass effect 2 streams
[0:53:34] <Profmcstevie> Do either you or Pat taste Coriander like soap
[0:53:47] <+chuckyswiss> LUL the basil leaf was great

[0:54:12] <@commanderclaw> If pat's not into spicier stuff there's always white fish
[0:54:12] <@PlagueOfGripes> MEG
[0:54:13] <%peyodogo> to be fair a bay leaf in your throat is Rough
[0:54:14] <Clundy> Cabbage is just spicy lettuce

[1:04:40] <@PlagueOfGripes> past a certain rank, you can start hiding in lockers again because killers assume no one is stupid enough to use them

[1:05:50] <+itsamedriggonny> vtuber needs a big cigar
[1:05:56] <Wiiplayah43> Good cigars smell great, but cigar smell always clings to fabric.
[1:05:56] <+XdaXcaptainX> @jetstreamlove_R thats the killers lullaby
[1:06:00] <+MooseIsGoose> I can do a hooka every now and then just never got into any other smoking besides the weed
[1:06:01] <%dankjerri> @anceldelambert bro shes already dead
[1:06:01] <lloyddboy> LUL
[1:06:05] <Reilata> I like the smell since cigars and pipes remind me of my dad.
[1:06:06] <critiquequartz> Your vtuber needs a cogar
[1:06:06] <%ssjklyco> A dying mouse

[1:39:52] <thepardack> if you look reeeeally closely you'll see googly eyes on the frontmost point of PH's head
[1:39:56] <CappuccinoGuil> what is that thing spinning around one of her teammates portrait?
[1:39:57] <crassplay_> Remember when Pyramid head was so fucking caked up when they first added him that they had to add a patch to nerf his amazing ass?

[1:40:39] <jetstreamlove_R> send to the Shadow Realm
[1:40:44] <%king_wragles> Cage unless she's on death hook, in which case he can kill her out right

[1:40:52] <crassplay_> Remember what they took from you
[1:40:52] <Noahccountingfortaste> while tormented, survivors can be "caged" instead of hooked AND if they are on death hook, PH can kill them outright
[1:40:53] <Mangahero18> Is it a rule that V-tubers have to have animal parts?
[1:40:56] <+MarlooRedd> @Mangahero18 why don't you have cat ears?

[1:41:07] <RickyRelucent> i'm not so worried about the cat ears, but wether or not she has human ears under the hair
[1:41:09] <%king_wragles> OTHER than getting hooked and or caged
[1:41:13] <%dankjerri> ah shit i gotta bed for work, see ya later chat
[1:41:23] <%GalacticaPhanto> @vyskus Their guilt manifests into that cake

[1:58:55] <KohryuZX> Kill La kill is honestly one of the best action anime of that year those who say otherwise are too stuck up to see the deeper meanings beneath the fan service which also has meaning in the plot.
[1:58:59] <+shruke> Odd Taxi is amazing
[1:59:03] <%Garthunox> survivor is just all down to preference
[1:59:09] <%tsubakiparadox> BNA is so good

[2:08:06] <Tselota> hi page
[2:08:07] <%That1blindkid> @Jekado a BUSSY SAKA?
[2:08:15] <$Sphincter_Spelunker> atpOld
[2:08:17] <%king_wragles> Wait, what about puppets?
[2:08:19] <TheYellowcouch> digital muppet
[2:08:19] <Wiiplayah43> LORE
[2:08:28] <%arcaderabbit48> MuppetSaliva
[2:08:30] <%AncelDeLambert> this is a little low-effort on use-end to really call a puppet
[2:08:30] <@Jekado> @That1blindkid geefSusp
[2:08:35] <kinetikpaws> that was smooth
[2:08:35] <%chuckyswiss> WHOA
[2:08:38] <stranger59> vtuber magic!
[2:08:39] <%baronblank> nice
[2:08:42] <%AncelDeLambert> and I say that as someone who really likes puppets
[2:08:42] <+MidnightBurst12> cool
[2:08:45] <%Dakuu75> she's wearing a motion-capture thing on her face? is that how these work?
[2:08:48] <%NeonLight> so what youre saying is emotions is when someone pushes your buttons?
[2:08:51] <HotSauceFiend> what is the range of emotions in your setup
[2:08:54] <+itsamedriggonny> i see i see
[2:08:58] <Coystick> Do you have a cheek-puff pout emote?
[2:08:59] <%chuckyswiss> Can you do this face Kreygasm
[2:09:02] <pizzacat2222> teach us
[2:09:04] <RickyRelucent> better emotions then some actors today
[2:09:04] <%AncelDeLambert> @PeachSaliva okay, quiz time, do you like Greg the Bunny? The greatest puppet tv show of all time
[2:09:09] <$JoshManVGH> Is the tracking JUST tied to your head or does it use your shoulders too?
[2:09:14] <Wiiplayah43> @AncelDeLambert Concept matters more than effort, though
[2:09:14] <$SiameseSneeze> pyar pyar
[2:09:20] <%EyeFarted> Is there a constipated emote?
[2:09:23] <%LysdexicAndVolingit> So are you switching to vtubing full time or just when you don't want to be on camera?
[2:09:26] <%probably_facetious> WfN did an amazing job. I've said it before, but it bears repeating.
[2:09:26] <%AncelDeLambert> fuck ye
[2:09:27] <%Dakuu75> neat
[2:09:31] <%That1blindkid> now gimme your angry face TTours TTours
[2:09:31] <%AncelDeLambert> YEAH HE WAS
[2:09:34] <+megaotter> Paige, would you ever go on CodeMiko?
[2:09:41] <%NeonLight> Do you have a war face?!
[2:09:41] <%AncelDeLambert> that was the Fox show, tho, the IFC show is where the REAL shit is
[2:09:47] <Tselota> Hipaige
[2:09:49] <$Sphincter_Spelunker> I saw Greg the bunny once before IFC was nuked from my cable package
[2:10:00] <+shruke> Paige your tweet made me learn about wonderbread and I don't know if I will ever recover.
[2:10:02] <intestinal_bleeding> oh :<
[2:10:07] <Valdorick> Or Pat is walking around naked
[2:10:11] <kinetikpaws> whats the cheapest iphone you could get to do the job? was thinking about doing it in future
[2:10:12] <%LysdexicAndVolingit> That makes sense; glad you've got a way to do that!
[2:10:22] <afronooch> i love miko
[2:10:51] <+itsamedriggonny> paige ur vtuber doesn't have lupus i can't believe you would lie like this
[2:10:51] <studleydoorite> if Pat appears on a stream can he have a basketball avatar
[2:10:53] <Vyskus> code Miko is impressive even on a purely technical standpoint. that stuff is incredible
[2:10:57] <%That1blindkid> Miko is too uncanny for my taste
[2:11:02] <%That1blindkid> respect tho
[2:11:11] <+killfrost11> peach i love the new v-tuber avi! congrats working on making one my self it's really cool looking
[2:11:31] <Coystick> It's good that this makes you feel comfortable, but it's harder to bully you like this.
[2:11:43] <$JoshManVGH> Wait! What did you used to do with puppets?
[2:11:55] <$Sphincter_Spelunker> @Coystick I'd say it's easier
[2:12:10] <+killfrost11> well i hope you enjoy and love it!
[2:12:11] <%NeonLight> I love that the vtubing trend has allowed so many shy people to stream outside their comfort zone
[2:12:13] <Vyskus> I have no use for one, but I find myself super jealous of people with cool vtube or vrchat avatars
[2:12:13] <+brigiethebaguette> the more comfy and happy you are the better the stream!
[2:12:19] <$raziel391> hey paige i love the avatar. Big question you probably have answer before. Why a fox and not a raccoon like you said your fursona to be?
[2:12:29] <$JoshManVGH> Gas blast
[2:12:35] <+shruke> oh this guy is a pain
[2:12:35] <%AncelDeLambert> I think I'd call this more "mask acting" than puppetry
[2:12:37] <Coystick> @Sphincter_Spelunker I need to see the panic in her eyes
[2:12:43] <Prism_Wing> Shoulda had your daily apple
[2:12:43] <%That1blindkid> @raziel391 im guessing because snuffy is popular
[2:12:44] <%AncelDeLambert> like, it's a SUPER good mask
[2:12:45] <Coystick> wow that sounded less creepy in my head
[2:12:56] <Faustgesicht> Shame Doctor is my main
[2:13:10] <ExpressNode> Pork and beans with chilly
[2:13:13] <$Sphincter_Spelunker> @Coystick did you catch yesterday's stream? it picked up some of her more panicked moments during bosses
[2:13:14] <+itsamedriggonny> you never have to explain why you're hiding in a locker
[2:13:18] <Faustgesicht> Ahhhh that's why barbeque doesn't work sometimes
[2:13:29] <$Sphincter_Spelunker> and blank stares
[2:14:00] <@SoFarFetched> yeah don't worry,everyone has a favorite/least favorite
[2:14:04] <Faustgesicht> That and Oni
[2:14:10] <+megaotter> when is elmo's vtuber debut?
[2:14:14] <intestinal_bleeding> he's very strong at anti-loops
[2:14:29] <Moonlight_Grimoire> Ghostface is my favorite, I like jumpscaring players and being a sneaky beakie
[2:14:32] <Prism_Wing> Doctor is cool af. Got a 4k on my 2nd time using him today. Only monitor and abuse. No add ons 😅
[2:14:37] <$ItsRatman> Hearing Paige say "Fuck my [Expletive]" but in 2D hits differently
[2:14:42] <JobbedBone> the first vs third person thing allows for some really cool tech
[2:14:55] <Wiiplayah43> anti-lupes
[2:15:00] <intestinal_bleeding> i think face of ghost and myers are the only two killers who can still jumpscare me
[2:15:04] <Coystick> @Sphincter_Spelunker I guess there will be more bullying overall since she's streaming more
[2:15:22] <+Grayhammatter> JILLUH
[2:15:27] <studleydoorite> Jill is truly a survivor
[2:15:29] <+JDSkully> Spirit and Trapper are my mains. I can't stand the doctor, I can't seem to ever win against him unless he's just a braindead player
[2:15:33] <%chuckyswiss> JILLUH U A HOLEUH
[2:15:45] <%LysdexicAndVolingit> Jill boned you hard there
[2:15:46] <Noahccountingfortaste> oof
[2:15:48] <Noahccountingfortaste> so close
[2:15:48] <kinetikpaws> oof last second
[2:15:48] <$Sphincter_Spelunker> whack
[2:15:49] <alwayspronking> so close D:
[2:15:50] <phantomsleeves> that gen was almost done too ugh why jill
[2:15:51] <@SoFarFetched> If you need a buddy,let me know geefO
[2:15:52] <stranger59> Sooooo close
[2:15:52] <%ItalianWaifu> does getting the marker on the white spot build meter faster on the gens?
[2:15:54] <intestinal_bleeding> oooof
[2:15:55] <Prism_Wing> just snap out of it 4Head
[2:16:03] <%AncelDeLambert> BAKANAI!
[2:16:03] <intestinal_bleeding> jill literally could've just held m1 for a second
[2:16:04] <$hrbeck_> Does the tracking work on the tits up the ass?
[2:16:06] <$Sphincter_Spelunker> wish she would do that to me
[2:16:07] <Faustgesicht> Aww that's mean
[2:16:17] <%AncelDeLambert> @PeachSaliva Fetched says she's up to join
[2:16:17] <%MechArch> sipsipRude
[2:16:24] <Faustgesicht> Let them finish glyphs
[2:16:26] <pizzacat2222> who your favorite steamer
[2:16:36] <Prism_Wing> It's scummy to not let peeps get the glyph otzMAD
[2:16:42] <+itsamedriggonny> could pat be a toilet if he wanted to using vtuber technology
[2:16:53] <+Soliloquy123> Oh, does madness tier 3 keep you from being healed?
[2:17:00] <@Jekado> she was just offering.
[2:17:04] <phantomsleeves> no pop?
[2:17:10] <+tkzhyon> this is a revamped map? looks good
[2:17:20] <BigFingerRo> creepos are already losing their shit at the existence of anime boobs on this here stream, testing out boob tracking might legit make some weirdo throw a brick through Peaches' window
[2:17:26] <%king_wragles> Oh, killer can't see survivor glyphs. Just their own
[2:17:28] <RickyRelucent> some people play conservatively
[2:17:31] <%king_wragles> It's bugged I think
[2:17:34] <RickyRelucent> because the win is more important
[2:17:39] <phantomsleeves> oh look who came back to finish the gen LUL
[2:17:41] <%LysdexicAndVolingit> Jill comes in to bone you again!
[2:17:44] <+tkzhyon> hate doctor
[2:17:53] <pizzacat2222> sipsipGasm sipsipGasm sipsipGasm sipsipGasm sipsipGasm sipsipGasm sipsipGasm
[2:17:57] <BigFingerRo> ME THO
[2:18:02] <BigFingerRo> MMMMMMM MMEEEE
[2:18:04] <$JoshManVGH> Wow just immediately tossed you into the shit again. Jill's cursed
[2:18:16] <intestinal_bleeding> HAAAAAH
[2:18:31] <+killfrost11> most likey dick
[2:18:38] <BigFingerRo> I like the random FIX animation the survivors do with the gens
[2:18:40] <pizzacat2222> pcrowPeek pcrowPeek pcrowPeek pcrowPeek pcrowPeek pcrowPeek sipsipGasm sipsipGasm sipsipGasm sipsipGasm sipsipGasm
[2:19:05] <BigFingerRo> it makes me think like someone was told "act like you're tinkering with it" and just randomly started wrenching at it
[2:19:17] <+Soliloquy123> Doc always has such a giant terror radius too so I'm on pins and needles all game :c
[2:19:45] <+tkzhyon> doc is a poo poo smelly man
[2:19:53] <@SoFarFetched> boy he giving you a bad time geefScared
[2:19:55] <+JDSkully> Almost every killer uses BBQ
[2:19:56] <intestinal_bleeding> i guess it's luck it's not... spirit?
[2:20:04] <%NeonLight> DOOT
[2:20:18] <+tkzhyon> spirit op
[2:20:19] <+JDSkully> I love Spirit :)
[2:20:19] <pizzacat2222> is there a game you'd play with chat
[2:20:30] <HotSauceFiend> I am so glad that yopou dont have to mash A anymore on second hook
[2:20:35] <RickyRelucent> could playy xcom somemtime and name ppl after chat
[2:20:40] <+tkzhyon> vs spirit i just accept that i'll lose
[2:20:54] <@SoFarFetched> She usually plays games with friends. She doesn't wanna really do games with chat since she has to deal with the adding on steam issue.
[2:20:55] <%NeonLight> monkaS
[2:20:56] <+itsamedriggonny> hahaha
[2:20:58] <BigFingerRo> I actually like it
[2:21:02] <%LysdexicAndVolingit> Whats the red light? I don't know much about dbd
[2:21:03] <Prism_Wing> I love the laugh
[2:21:04] <Vileosis> since when Paige is a vtuber?
[2:21:06] <Moonlight_Grimoire> the mashing sucked, it was the reason I didn't enjoy playing survivor
[2:21:10] <@SoFarFetched> I think last time you tried...Jackbox?
[2:21:13] <Prism_Wing> it's weirdly satisfying
[2:21:16] <@SoFarFetched> yeah Chat can't be trusted
[2:21:17] <$hrbeck_> @vileosis always
[2:21:17] <%Dakuu75> don't do it
[2:21:18] <%MarylandJutsu> Too many wierdoes here
[2:21:22] <RetroCop87> you could play that marble game with chat
[2:21:24] <intestinal_bleeding> because unfortunately some people are weridos
[2:21:25] <$ItsRatman> I think Jackbox is pretty much the only game
[2:21:27] <@Jekado> Jackbox with chat as the audience would be fine.
[2:21:29] <+LensWander> Doctor's laugh sounds like a distorted version of the kekw laugh
[2:21:30] <BigFingerRo> it sounds like the kind of sfx that you'd hear in a haunted house at a fair
[2:21:31] <+MooseIsGoose> smart
[2:21:31] <RickyRelucent> the internet is weird, stick to your circle
[2:21:32] <%NeonLight> I wouldnt even play with me
[2:21:36] <HotSauceFiend> jackbox and drawful
[2:21:37] <kinetikpaws> yea that could be bad, id love to play with my big brain ace main

[2:25:54] <+chester804> Paige have you watched Beastars?

[2:25:55] <DusK_The_Stray> Big Paws to bap people with sounds like fun.

[2:26:06] <RickyRelucent> "I'm a gamer!" Plays cod for 2 hours a day
[2:26:08] <%MarylandJutsu> Comparing that to gamers is setting it a low bar
[2:26:09] <Explodincatz> LUL
[2:26:11] <$Sphincter_Spelunker> what about the fuck place
[2:26:11] <$hrbeck_> Furries try

[2:26:16] <$Sphincter_Spelunker> or was it fuck room
[2:26:17] <+itsamedriggonny> showering is for normies
[2:26:21] <%AncelDeLambert> WHY CAN'T PEOPLE JUST BE CHILL
[2:26:25] <stranger59> Furries > gamers, all day, every day.

[2:26:27] <%AncelDeLambert> like, c'mon
[2:26:31] <+Grayhammatter> fuck-room adjacent
[2:26:31] <+itsamedriggonny> all furries i know are nice
[2:26:52] <RickyRelucent> people are just desperate for an identity and will latch onto anything
[2:26:52] <+tkzhyon> i play trading card games sometimes and those guys kind of stink LUL
[2:26:56] <TurtlesAndTentacles> they pity the none fox!
[2:26:56] <Wiiplayah43> @PeachSaliva Sucks about the game cons. I went to Quake Con a lot, and the vast majority of them are nice.
[2:26:58] <+killfrost11> all the furryies i know are very sweet and kind

[2:27:03] <@SoFarFetched> yeah TCG players definitely stink
[2:27:04] <+shruke> pretty much everyone is better than gamers tbh
[2:27:05] <$ItsRatman> No keep throwing shade at smelly gamers. They MUST shower
[2:27:06] <%vVAstrAVv> they have to be chill if they want the yiff pit
[2:27:09] <$hrbeck_> Smelly
[2:27:13] <%Garthunox> you ever see internet historians video on Rain furrest?
[2:27:14] <bevyrage> 桃狐 (momo kitsune) or 'peach fox'
[2:27:16] <+itsamedriggonny> furries tend to also be lgbt, in my experience, so they at least understand being marginalized
[2:27:17] <%king_wragles> Paige has spreadsheets with time stamps, don't be fooled
[2:27:20] <RetroCop87> Paige, I don't think anyone here will be offended by the notion that gamer cons smell bad
[2:27:25] <%MarylandJutsu> @SoFarFetched but are they smellier than smash players?
[2:27:27] <%Mister_McDerp> friday night magic has a special kind of stink
[2:27:30] <%AncelDeLambert> LOVE IH
[2:27:32] <+TehBrickz> Oh noes
[2:27:34] <%NeonLight> oof
[2:27:39] <%AncelDeLambert> Historian is fun
[2:27:39] <critiquequartz> People at anime cons/ games cons don’t know how to keep their hands to themselves
[2:27:40] <stranger59> I don't recall this level, but it's been ages since I played.
[2:27:46] <$Sphincter_Spelunker> is that the diaper thing
[2:27:47] <+killfrost11> TCG player to me are the worst of the worst I will never go to a game of magic the gathering ever in my life
[2:27:49] <%AncelDeLambert> at least this isn't an indoors level
[2:27:51] <%king_wragles> How come survivors don't spawn together when I'm Huntress?
[2:27:54] <+Walopoh> SourPls
[2:27:54] <BigFingerRo> I've only been at small comic cons, but I am not a girl, so that alone makes it much less likely to get shitty treatment from people
[2:28:02] <+TehBrickz> Miguel!!
[2:28:13] <critiquequartz> I wore basically a sheet ghost to my last con and it was the best con experience I’ve ever had
[2:28:21] <$TheGreatSkenardo> Weird how well-lit this level is.
[2:28:22] <yodajr99> Mitchell Maguire
[2:28:25] <stranger59> @king_wragles Survivors normally use an item to spawn together.
[2:28:33] <%AncelDeLambert> survivors spawning together is bad, it makes the round go too fast
[2:28:38] <kinetikpaws> are you thinking of going back to BLFC in the future since covid dying down? that was my fav con Cheer100 Cheer100
[2:28:43] <%king_wragles> @stranger59 I've been playing this game for a few years, but thanks for the tip
[2:28:55] <+Tobatcie> I think the furry community was fairly accepting from the first, which attracted people who needed somewhere to be accepted. Those people went on to be more accepting of others in turn and the cycle continues
[2:28:57] <BigFingerRo> FLASLIGHT HIM
[2:28:59] <+tkzhyon> myers you scary bastord
[2:29:04] <%king_wragles> might actually get out of red rank, games are too serious these days
[2:29:05] <+Astrobstrd> Mikey time
[2:29:08] <$TheNewZealandStory> @AncelDeLambert it does the opposite, if they all spawn together you can pressure them all at once
[2:29:12] <$TheGreatSkenardo> Why would anyone go places
[2:29:16] <$NitronStreams> damn these gens are real close
[2:29:20] <%MarylandJutsu> Same here Paige

[2:44:54] <%king_wragles> The which one? badum tiss
[2:44:56] <%Mister_McDerp> it was very disappointing
[2:44:58] <whittacre> the ending is pretty dissapointing
[2:44:59] <%MarylandJutsu> the next one looks kinda cool
[2:44:59] <Arancet> should play it and see
[2:45:01] <+tkzhyon> i thought little hope was good
[2:45:05] <@SoFarFetched> @Estuko 4K = 4 kills/team wipe
[2:45:05] <CommanderCOOL> whoa Paige is a vtuber. I love it
[2:45:06] <whittacre> hopefully the next one is good
[2:45:07] <%CopperTucker> Paige I have been waiting for you to play Little Hope for like a year
[2:45:10] <bevyrage> until dawn is basically the good one out of the series
[2:45:14] <critiquequartz> I did not like little hope
[2:45:19] <bevyrage> every other game in the series so far has been lackluster
[2:45:22] <%CopperTucker> it wouldn't be the first time you played a bad game tbh
[2:45:25] <mr_saturday93> The twist in little hope is really bad
[2:45:33] <+tkzhyon> now that i think back little hope did have some random junk in it
[2:45:34] <Mattais88> Why isn't there an Until Dawn character in this game yet?
[2:45:34] <%MarylandJutsu> yeah the new one seemed kinda cool
[2:45:35] <whittacre> new one is out October
[2:45:36] <ExileNineteen> supermassive is pretty much done until they get quality writers again, if it ever happens
[2:45:42] <%That1blindkid> @PeachSaliva im still pissed you had a near perfect run in until dawn but one person died
[2:45:46] <mr_saturday93> Im not
[2:45:49] <gaelic_otaku> I heard Until Dawn was good and I watched Rimmy Down Under play Little Hope
[2:45:52] <+tkzhyon> oops ma bad lol
[2:45:58] <@SoFarFetched> shes just saying not to just in case
[2:45:58] <%king_wragles> So at the end of Little Hope, everyone just falls to the ground dead as a door nail
[2:45:58] <+Mekhet09> @ExileNineteen What happened?
[2:46:06] <%king_wragles> They super just die like a corpse
[2:46:06] <+allups> ur ganna forget
[2:46:08] <phantomsleeves> WOW LOL

[2:46:29] <superduckywho> Oooo!

[3:07:33] <%Dakuu75> @SoFarFetched Saw that you chose that Goose game as your first stream. How was it? (I been wanting to pick it up.)
[3:07:33] <%zangetsu_114> Hey I love your new v-tube thing going on!
[3:07:33] <Coystick> @PeachSaliva there must be a much smaller "streamer tax" effect when you're digital mode

[3:08:11] <+Taisuru> -squint-
[3:08:29] <@SoFarFetched> @Dakuu75 I liked it! it's definitely got some small issues here and there,but not enough to make you turn away from the game. It's definitely good fun if you like the Metal Slug games.
[3:08:30] <+GloweyEyes_Sapphire> it is very exhausting
[3:08:49] <tanarath> Paige, you're a jerk sometimes but it's ok because you really do care.
[3:08:50] <@SoFarFetched> And yeah I figured a new game for a first stream would be nice. Thought of some other games but I was like "nah Imma try with goose game"

[3:11:38] <Coystick> Say the line Ashley
[3:11:39] <Sartastic> HEEELP
[3:11:40] <+LensWander> Etiquette coaches, teaches people how to dress and act at high-class social functions
[3:11:43] <$Puhff> LEON YOU MUST FUCK
[3:11:48] <+jay_bazza> bye cute fox lady I have to go rubrLove rubrBless
[3:11:48] <%Dakuu75> I think the ONE public speaking I took from high school was "Never say "Um-" say, "and" instead"
[3:11:49] <%Marzby> Nope. just Theatre. nature of Irish degrees
[3:11:54] <%chuckyswiss> rub me Leon Kreygasm
[3:11:56] <Faustgesicht> Have you played a killer on stream before paige?
[3:11:58] <+DBTenno> And somewhere out there, Chris is shouting, "NO LEON, RUB MY SISTER, NOT HER! THINK OF THE BLOODLINE!"
[3:12:01] <$DensityD> on the matters of the bloodline
[3:12:15] <+superblar> @Puhff He can't. Ada hasn't told him what sex is yet.
[3:12:23] <critiquequartz> @hotsaucefiend it was more a joke at the people saying to them to go back to school and get a new degree, but I’m looking in to actuary certs
[3:12:25] <+shruke> I was lucky to stay at my cheap local college and grab a scholarship. Didn't cover all of it, but a lot
[3:12:28] <phantomsleeves> oh that leon tried so hardn
[3:12:29] <Arancet> yeah you did once or twice
[3:12:32] <@SoFarFetched> yeah you played freddie on the quietshy stream
[3:12:32] <%Marzby> Youth Theatre is where the moneys at but I dont like kids lol
[3:12:33] <$Sphincter_Spelunker> @superblar she totally has
[3:12:34] <%NeonLight> I keep mishearing Leon and thinking Im getting called out
[3:12:35] <Belakitu> That scream always reminds me of Finn from Adventure Time
[3:12:39] <$DensityD> have you played Remnant: From the Ashes on stream?
[3:12:39] <Noahccountingfortaste> we've definitely seen you dunk on Pat at least once on stream
[3:12:52] <Captainahab_37> I cut my thumb on a cheese grater :(
[3:12:59] <Captainahab_37> it wasn't cool
[3:13:00] <+GloweyEyes_Sapphire> i can play a little bit of huntress
[3:13:00] <@SoFarFetched> that doesnt sound "grate"
[3:13:02] <$DensityD> get well soon
[3:13:04] <demiiluna> Do you think the reason they won't put FNAF in the game is because there's already a Freddy
[3:13:09] <%Rumbutt> oroDC oroDC oroDC
[3:13:19] <%Dakuu75> @Captainahab_37 my condolences to your thumb
[3:13:20] <+DBTenno> @Captainahab_37 Oof you just realized one of my fears whenever I handle cheese.
[3:13:22] <stranger59> The dishonorable disconnect.
[3:13:31] <$JoshManVGH> This is true. Many jobs that say "minimum education BA or Higher" will typically consider you no matter what the degree is in, it's wild. My old IT manager had a masters in Civil Service. It's wild.
[3:13:32] <@SoFarFetched> I mean if it was freddy the bear,they would just call him "The Animatronic"
[3:13:34] <+Astrobstrd> The Nightmare iirc
[3:13:36] <%zangetsu_114> Freddy Fazbear
[3:13:36] <Djinnazz> Fuzzy
[3:13:36] <@SoFarFetched> "The NightMare"
[3:13:44] <Djinnazz> Fazzy even
[3:13:44] <StarkMaximum> The Nightbear
[3:13:46] <puse9> the nightmare?
[3:13:47] <%LastHazzerd> none of them are named their real name
[3:13:47] <Captainahab_37> Jimmy da Grape
[3:13:47] <%NeonLight> The Bear
[3:13:52] <$DensityD> it should be Chica anyway
[3:14:01] <+DBTenno> That's unBearable
[3:14:03] <Faustgesicht> The Showbear
[3:14:05] <+Astrobstrd> They really could just say The Animatronic and it'd be fine
[3:14:08] <puse9> would it be funny if they add nightman in DBD
[3:14:10] <%ssjklyco> Hunter of the Day Bear
[3:14:11] <%chuckyswiss> oh God not the puns
[3:14:12] <+InhumanMilitia> night otter is more apt
[3:14:19] <$DensityD> who's got the Vinesauce -2 emotes?
[3:14:22] <$DensityD> I need Fozzies
[3:14:29] <@SoFarFetched> psa2guy psa2guy
[3:14:34] <puse9> and the survivor would be dayman
[3:14:39] <%zangetsu_114> I could be Springtrap
[3:14:53] <%zangetsu_114> *It
[3:14:55] <StarkMaximum> @zangetsu_114 You could be! We'd never know.
[3:15:01] <$DensityD> sake-ah
[3:15:01] <%Marzby> Paige what did you dislike about the performance aspect of work

[3:15:39] <$DensityD> the feet lusters
[3:15:43] <Captainahab_37> Nightmare of the 13th street
[3:15:43] <%AncelDeLambert> Paige, your camera control is baffling
[3:16:16] <@SoFarFetched> think its time to find hatch
[3:16:24] <%Dakuu75> Hardest thing is probably keeping up with reading Chat while playing a game
[3:16:38] <Captainahab_37> bug legs ew
[3:16:45] <phantomsleeves> why is she crouching walking?
[3:16:47] <@SoFarFetched> "find the hatch,fug meg geefTux "

[3:17:42] <$Sphincter_Spelunker> you can't kill me, I'll kill me
[3:17:44] <BigFingerRo> Have you considered gitting gud, Peaches?
[3:18:20] <@SoFarFetched> Paige forgets to hit the "live" button

[3:18:24] <+InhumanMilitia> so do you have too keep your hands down to make sure the face tracker works
[3:18:31] <%Marzby> yeah
[3:18:41] <hearingthenseeing> Paige what was that French book you're reading
[3:18:43] <%Dakuu75> this game could make a great movie. Maybe something like Maze Runner, where they try to survive killers everyday
[3:18:50] <tacostarvedbeast> Mrs. Understand
[3:18:51] <$Sphincter_Spelunker> Paige also listens to her own intro and forgets she has a stream to start
[3:18:51] <Xenioplate> Paige says racial slurs LIVE on stream
[3:19:10] <hearingthenseeing> To learn the language
[3:19:14] <tacostarvedbeast> ohhh paige speaking french? sounds sugoi
[3:19:25] <+LensWander> Streamer: "I don't want a ham sandwich today." Viewer: "You hear that, streamer hates ham!"
[3:19:34] <tacostarvedbeast> dang this survivor hair game on point
[3:19:48] <thetransagenda> parlez-vous francais?
[3:20:09] <+SharpClaw_> paige only wants ham if it'S on pats sandwich
[3:20:10] <+LensWander> Comment ca va type-stuff
[3:20:17] <hearingthenseeing> I think you said it was like French in fifteen minutes or something?
[3:20:19] <@SoFarFetched> Im still thinking about how you paid money to be taught Quebec French,but you were just taught regular French and the teacher was like "Well shit you gotta learn quebecois on the streets geefPathetic "
[3:20:25] <%Dakuu75> omelette du fromage

[3:23:11] <Dave_VD> @tacostarvedbeast You're thinking of Pyrenees
[3:23:13] <%king_wragles> Oh, the bushes at my parents' old place were peonies. They smell nice
[3:23:14] <%chuckyswiss> That's very sweet <3
[3:23:16] <Captainahab_37> Aren't some flowers edible

[3:23:34] <BigFingerRo> Bugambilias are edible
[3:23:35] <%AncelDeLambert> THAT'S IT, I'M UNSUBSCRIBING FROM SUPERBUTTERBUNS!
[3:23:35] <Faustgesicht> Are you sure they aren't Marigolds, Paige?
[3:23:37] <hearingthenseeing> They're all edible if you're a dog
[3:23:44] <%Dakuu75> My mom got me to like cacti. The way they bloom for jsut a few days a year, is cool.
[3:23:44] <Wiiplayah43> Renunculas?
[3:23:50] <Captainahab_37> I know eating morning glory seeds is a big no no
[3:24:01] <tacostarvedbeast> tried coconut water for the first time, wasn't expecting it taste kind salty
[3:24:15] <%samTUMZfestival> Are you purposely hiding the bazongas because of the feedback? hehe
[3:24:15] <$Sphincter_Spelunker> nah, it's water
[3:24:24] <Captainahab_37> hibiscus is nice
[3:24:31] <tacostarvedbeast> ladies and germs
[3:24:36] <%AncelDeLambert> I've had coconut water from a FRESH coconut. And it was so rich it almost gave me an upset stomach
[3:24:38] <MelfinaStarwind> @Captainahab_37 love hibiscus scent
[3:24:48] <freelancebabymaker> there used to be these energy drinks with coconut water that i really liked
[3:24:51] <vonmaultke> Having fresh coconut water from Tonga was fantastic. WAY better then what they sell
[3:24:56] <@SoFarFetched> betting its haunted grounds
[3:24:57] <%Dakuu75> do you have to boil coconut water if it's right from the coconut? or it's safe to drink right away?
[3:24:58] <tacostarvedbeast> bing bong?
[3:24:59] <Captainahab_37> I hear coconut water really...clears the bowels?
[3:25:00] <+Grayhammatter> bing bong
[3:25:01] <@SoFarFetched> HAUNTED GROUNDS
[3:25:03] <@SoFarFetched> CONFIRMMMMEDDDD
[3:25:03] <freelancebabymaker> but idk if i could do full on coconut water
[3:25:05] <%AncelDeLambert> fresh coconut is good. Anything coconut that is NOT fresh, less so
[3:25:06] <thetransagenda> yo this model is adorable
[3:25:12] <@SoFarFetched> YOU ACTIVATED HAUNTED GROUNNNNDS
[3:25:14] <%AncelDeLambert> loser
[3:25:15] <demiiluna> No honor D:
[3:25:15] <DrFacilier> too scawy
[3:25:17] <%LastHazzerd> ayyyy, lmao
[3:25:23] <$TheNewZealandStory> cant even blame anyone for disconnecting against spirit
[3:25:25] <%chuckyswiss> Spirit? Nope, I'm out.
[3:25:54] <%king_wragles> Night all
[3:25:56] <vonmaultke> Want fresh coconuts now pvpCOPE
[3:25:56] <Kain5707> Paige when are you going to join the FF14 hype train?
[3:25:56] <@SoFarFetched> YEAH YOU DID,I BETTED BEFOREHAND IT WOULD BE
[3:25:58] <%samTUMZfestival> Still getting used to the model it's so cute
[3:25:58] <@SoFarFetched> geefO geefO
[3:26:08] <Captainahab_37> FF14 blew the FUCK up
[3:26:09] <%Dakuu75> you should be able to just put the pallet back up. they're not THAT heavy lol
[3:26:13] <tacostarvedbeast> i assume its the same feeling when you play against rogues in magic
[3:26:27] <$Sphincter_Spelunker> @Captainahab_37 cuz WoW imploded again
[3:26:34] <@SoFarFetched> I feel like FF14 for her would be an overload of things for her with how MUCH you need to do.
[3:26:36] <+Di0nin> how often do you play killer? if so, who's your main?
[3:26:40] <@SoFarFetched> well you CAN,its a Yui Perk
[3:26:46] <HotSauceFiend> unles you are that yuki chracter
[3:26:48] <$TheNewZealandStory> spirit and twins typically arent worth playing out a match against, even if you win it pretty boring
[3:26:54] <Captainahab_37> I never got into WoW but 14 is some good shit
[3:27:05] <Pixel_Butts> BRUH PEACH! WHAT HAPPENED?!?!? you look amazing
[3:27:07] <+Gondab> Wait, why isn't Peach getting skill checks, is that a Survivor perk?
[3:27:11] <%chuckyswiss> LUL that was a good one
[3:27:23] <tacostarvedbeast> palettes acutally made of card board to prevent Olympic athletes for having sex on them
[3:27:24] <%Dakuu75> Damn! Paige get's that sonic-speed when she gets hit.
[3:27:26] <$TheNewZealandStory> why no exhaustion perks
[3:27:32] <%chuckyswiss> fuck yeah
[3:27:33] <Captainahab_37> This game needs Benny Hill music
[3:27:42] <blue8moon> what race would paige be in FF14
[3:27:45] <Prism_Wing> When I last left you were talking about how you hate Spirit, and now I come back to a Spirit match LUL
[3:27:50] <armchairmaster_> Paige's balls at risk
[3:27:50] <@SoFarFetched> she dabbles in the exhaustion alright geefSmugAF
[3:28:01] <@Jekado> @blue8moon Potato
[3:28:03] <tacostarvedbeast> why people don't like playing against spirit?
[3:28:09] <bevyrage> are exhaustion perks in elmo's bag though?
[3:28:10] <%Marzby> hey
[3:28:14] <%samTUMZfestival> Dabbledowning
[3:28:21] <%Marzby> couldnt sleep so I'm back lol
[3:28:21] <@Jekado> Lalafel
[3:28:22] <demiiluna> But they have bunny bois now too!
[3:28:26] <+Gondab> Because Spirit is amazing at cat and mouse.
[3:28:37] <Faustgesicht> Seen the Bunny boys yet Paige?
[3:28:37] <tacostarvedbeast> id be down to be a smol bunny boy in that game
[3:28:41] <@SoFarFetched> @tacostarvedbeast some people are bad at when she does her "invisible" travel.
[3:28:46] <Prism_Wing> Aaaaaaaaaaa
[3:28:55] <$TheNewZealandStory> but why stand there
[3:29:03] <bevyrage> that was a pretty awful latency
[3:29:06] <%Marzby> Marzby is gifting 1 Tier 1 Subs to PeachSaliva's community! They've gifted a total of 1 in the channel! 
[3:29:06] <%Marzby> Marzby gifted a Tier 1 sub to TheYellowcouch! 
[3:29:06] <@SoFarFetched> she probably thought spirit was travelling
[3:29:07] <@SoFarFetched> LUL
[3:29:10] <@SoFarFetched> oh no flashlight
[3:29:11] <+Beebo_Brebo> This game is neato
[3:29:13] <%AncelDeLambert> that was by a PIXEL
[3:29:16] <%Dakuu75> you can't use a flashlight if your bloody. the blood makes the button slippery
[3:29:18] <@Jekado> another twitch streamer?
[3:29:20] <tacostarvedbeast> maybe spirits vision is based on movement, like a movie t rex
[3:29:22] <@SoFarFetched> you dont have a flashlight,
[3:29:24] <@SoFarFetched> LUL
[3:29:29] <@SoFarFetched> did they knock it down with franklins?
[3:29:30] <blue8moon> LUL
[3:29:34] <demiiluna> I totally play a bunny girl in FFXIV I tried to build her to be Wooliebait so she's tall, dark, muscled, short purple hair and green tats.
[3:29:37] <tacostarvedbeast> she kinda thicc dough
[3:29:39] <bevyrage> oh right, yeah paige you don't even have flashlight as a perk. otherwise it'd be in your hand
[3:29:43] <Captainahab_37> this Smurf has it out for you
[3:29:46] <Prism_Wing> My favorite thing about Spirit us "Aaaaaaaaaaaaa!" Like, why does the pallet hurt her THAT much? lol
[3:30:05] <Faustgesicht> Can spirit be a nice farmer or she just for sweat?
[3:30:06] <TurtlesAndTentacles> Paige you really shouldnt try to outsmart your skill set is fixing and helping lol
[3:30:08] <HotSauceFiend> quick page mash A
[3:30:10] <Captainahab_37> the spider legs are YUCKY
[3:30:13] <bevyrage> the pallet is covered in salt. she's very bitter about getting hit by it
[3:30:16] <@SoFarFetched> yeah either she didn't go in the game with a flashlight,or Spirit had Franklin's Demise which you smack an item out of their hand when you injure them.
[3:30:19] <+Gondab> The best thing is when you go invisible, FAKE travveling and stand still, letting people just run into you.
[3:30:20] <%chuckyswiss> Fight it Paige!
[3:30:31] <+Buzzard42> LOL
[3:30:35] <blue8moon> right into the knife
[3:30:36] <demiiluna> you tried!
[3:30:36] <+Di0nin> been a bit since I played, how long has 2nd hook been skill checks instead of mashing?
[3:30:36] <%chuckyswiss> LUL
[3:30:36] <+Grayhammatter> LUL
[3:30:37] <$DensityD> that's the noise to make
[3:30:39] <%chuckyswiss> damn
[3:30:44] <%samTUMZfestival> It's crazy how long this game's been popular.
[3:30:48] <+DBTenno> Time to get a 4-person discord squad to troll the Spirit
[3:30:54] <TurtlesAndTentacles> I'm sorry paige
[3:30:56] <@SoFarFetched> @Di0nin wanna say maybe a month or two now? geefThink maybe more
[3:31:01] <tacostarvedbeast> lol yea, getting 'u dont get to play' vibes from spirit killer
[3:31:09] <dan_g_v> is it good, tho
[3:31:10] <Captainahab_37> Is overwatch still popular or does nobody care
[3:31:12] <HotSauceFiend> When I play spirit, I generally try to be more generous with who I hook. It's hard to play against
[3:31:15] <Wiiplayah43> "only" 5?
[3:31:17] <@SoFarFetched> Overwatch is kinda just there
[3:31:24] <%Dakuu75> I think this and that Jason game came out, close to each other but, this was the clear winner
[3:31:28] <bevyrage> yeah it's relatively recent i'd say. within the recent fiscal quarter
[3:31:32] <tacostarvedbeast> overwatch was fun for a summer
[3:31:33] <codyppp1> digging the the vtuber look peach.
[3:31:34] <+Di0nin> @SoFarFetched yeah, been since last december since I played, makes sense I missed a lot lol
[3:31:37] <mr_saturday93> man fuck nurse
[3:31:37] <HotSauceFiend> Nurse Is fantastic
[3:31:53] <$TheNewZealandStory> nurse aint that hard to play, people exaggerate
[3:32:01] <+Gondab> It's only really worth playing a ton of when you can actually get BP through
[3:32:14] <HotSauceFiend> Nurse requires experience. People just dont jump into nurse as their first killer
[3:32:19] <+Gondab> like anniversery/lantern festible
[3:32:26] <+Di0nin> I love gorgon
[3:32:29] <%Marzby> I first was introduced to you during Pat's Japan video. time is weird
[3:32:29] <stranger59> If Friday the 13th wasn't kneecapped by the rights stuff, I'd play that more than DBD. But it was, so it sadly never got more to it.
[3:32:42] <Prism_Wing> Did you download the latest Windows update? Kappa
[3:33:01] <Captainahab_37> Friday the 13th I thought went offline
[3:33:09] <Captainahab_37> probably cuz I'm insane
[3:33:11] <%tuesti> wow same
[3:33:12] <hearingthenseeing> Paige do you have a game you thought you would love but ended up disliking?
[3:33:21] <+Beebo_Brebo> I think I first saw you there too
[3:33:26] <tacostarvedbeast> was that pre of post preiscope sonic shenanigan's?
[3:33:31] <%Marzby> your hip was bit by a dumb deer lol
[3:33:36] <Prism_Wing> prismw1Lara
[3:33:40] <Captainahab_37> FF10 has good combat
[3:33:43] <+DBTenno> Titus: "Aaaaahhahahahaha"
[3:33:44] <%AncelDeLambert> yeah: Backbone
[3:33:45] <%LastHazzerd> HAH HAH HAH HAH HAH
[3:33:45] <@SoFarFetched> thats fair
[3:33:50] <Captainahab_37> then there's the rest of 10
[3:33:53] <%AncelDeLambert> MAN Backbone was a massive disappointment
[3:33:55] <stranger59> @Captainahab_37 I think it's still up, but just can't get any updates due to whatever the rights situation is now.
[3:33:56] <@SoFarFetched> I remember you playing FF9 one time on stream
[3:33:56] <Captainahab_37> which is an issue
[3:34:01] <+BoboDaHobo> 10 sucks, it's just a hallway
[3:34:02] <TheSmerdis> I first became a fan of you through following Asterios. (which is Ironic cause i had been a fan of pat for years by that point)
[3:34:03] <Mattais88> I love it, but can see why others don't
[3:34:03] <Kain5707> FF10 is meh
[3:34:03] <%samTUMZfestival> That's a fun noise.
[3:34:03] <Wiiplayah43> I've heard mixed opinions about both, I personally enjoyed them
[3:34:06] <+Di0nin> Plagues video on 10 made me pee myself
[3:34:08] <tacostarvedbeast> combat good, i love the music, other than that its meh story and very linear
[3:34:11] <HotSauceFiend> I was excited for the Wonderful 1010 release on Steam. Then it released as a buggy mess
[3:34:12] <Prism_Wing> I love 10. It's a scuffed mess, but I love it.
[3:34:13] <AFlyingTaco1> 10's fine
[3:34:14] <brisk_dacat> What about nine
[3:34:15] <henshin2289> and ff7 is just nostalgia trash
[3:34:17] <%thewhiterice92> If you don't connect with Tidus and Yuna then you're really not gonna feel it
[3:34:17] <%arcaderabbit48> X starts out rough and has you doing menial chores that won't matter again for like 40 hours
[3:34:17] <Captainahab_37> first fuckin ff I played was 13 I hated it
[3:34:28] <fluffy_sauce> those are the correct answers, about 8 and 10 @PeachSaliva
[3:34:28] <Captainahab_37> I was like "why do people like this?!"
[3:34:31] <%samTUMZfestival> Bleetzboll
[3:34:32] <Prism_Wing> fuck blitzball tho
[3:34:36] <dan_g_v> that essay goes to crazy places XD Definitely not what I was expecting
[3:34:38] <%AncelDeLambert> Man, Plague does NOT understand The Fayth
[3:34:43] <+Di0nin> first FF i played was crisis core, man that game is gone
[3:34:44] <AFlyingTaco1> But IV is a great game
[3:34:45] <RickyRelucent> i didn't get most of that
[3:34:45] <+SharpClaw_> no one liked 13
[3:34:50] <Captainahab_37> I hear 6 is the bestest FF
[3:34:50] <dan_g_v> does people understand the Fayth?
[3:35:00] <RickyRelucent> But the ripping into one of the 3 stooges was fun
[3:35:01] <%arcaderabbit48> $ on the NES when it was called 2?
[3:35:03] <MogMoogle1> kupo
[3:35:04] <HotSauceFiend> @sharpclaw, no one line 13-1, people liked 13-2
[3:35:04] <%AncelDeLambert> I does understand the Fayth
[3:35:05] <markdreizehn> Which character in FF4 did you like most/self insert into?
[3:35:08] <Captainahab_37> but I only played 10-15 minus 11
[3:35:09] <%AncelDeLambert> I is nondumb
[3:35:10] <dan_g_v> you does!
[3:35:11] <HotSauceFiend> some people
[3:35:14] <%Dakuu75> Plague was jsut shitting all over the Lucas Goers and Blitzball for like 20 minutes. it was fucking amazing lol
[3:35:17] <$DensityD> needs more wah-wah-wah-wah
[3:35:19] <Captainahab_37> and minus x-2 cuz fuuuuck that
[3:35:20] <Coystick> FFIV I love as a classic fantasy rpg more than a final fantasy rpg
[3:35:24] <Mattais88> japanse 4 or american 4?
[3:35:25] <tacostarvedbeast> which one has the dude who suplexs a train?
[3:35:27] <Laioken13> crazy i also learned to read because of ff4
[3:35:27] <+logoth_> Did you like the DS remake?
[3:35:28] <Kain5707> so Paige would be a summoner limesHmm
[3:35:29] <+alternative_flu> FF6 was my first exposure to the series
[3:35:31] <Coystick> Cecil is my favorite FF protag
[3:35:33] <Quikanims> Oh wow, the vtuber thing wasn’t a joke
[3:35:38] <MogMoogle1> do you keep original names or rename every character in older FF games?
[3:35:42] <+SharpClaw_> did anyone play the crystal chronicles remake ?
[3:35:43] <Wiiplayah43> @henshin2289 Oof, a lot of people are going back to it & still enjoying it. I think that's just you, bromigo.
[3:35:46] <AFlyingTaco1> I still can't believe she ends up with Edge.
[3:35:49] <@SoFarFetched> I was watching that stream VOD when doing FF14 runs LUL
[3:35:53] <@SoFarFetched> so that cecil thing is FRESH in my mind
[3:35:58] <%AncelDeLambert> CECIIIIILLuh! I dropped my waaaaaanduh!
[3:36:03] <%arcaderabbit48> "I have a bow for some reason but I never use it when it would matter! Kiss me, Cecil!"
[3:36:08] <%Dakuu75> I think the only reason FFX is my favorite... is Auron
[3:36:10] <%robobeau> Also Edge / Rydia is the OTP in that game anyway
[3:36:10] <RetroCop87> I love Zidane, in that he's the only FF protag that's always confident in himself
[3:36:12] <Melchior_the_Wise> we are fufilling Paige's dream of being a furry
[3:36:27] <Zaphire_Saucypants> Nah, I support this 2D dream.
[3:36:28] <theincrediblerick> Paige has become vtuber??
[3:36:32] <Quikanims> Eh I don’t hate the gimmick, do you
[3:36:33] <@Jekado> What about mystic quest geefSmugAF
[3:36:34] <tacostarvedbeast> the most sex appeal
[3:36:37] <$DensityD> she's an ancient goddess cursed by a witch
[3:36:37] <Coystick> "Child of the party timeskips to become a badass" is a great trope
[3:36:37] <mr_saturday93> 6 is superior fight me
[3:36:37] <$JoshManVGH> Peach, did you ever play Lost Odyssey?
[3:36:40] <+DBTenno> Speaking of bullshit, did the devs intend for the K-pop "killer" to be the most un-threatening design?
[3:36:40] <%Marzby> Pat was a big part of me growing up. now I'm 26 and watch you both weekly. First time having money to subscribe in my life so just wanted to say thanks paige!
[3:36:44] <RetroCop87> FFIX is the underdog
[3:36:48] <+logoth_> 6's cast is unmatched
[3:36:51] <Melchior_the_Wise> and the best thing is your anime persona will never age
[3:36:53] <HotSauceFiend> FF6 blew my mind. Then celeste became the main character
[3:36:54] <Melchior_the_Wise> :)
[3:36:54] <demiiluna> The Brave New World mod for Final Fantasy 6 is really fun, it gives all the characters much more clearly defined niches so they're all useful and fun to use in their own way.
[3:36:55] <%robobeau> Shame it never got remade in the FFIV DS remake
[3:36:56] <HotSauceFiend> and it was amazing
[3:37:04] <RickyRelucent> i actually like legend of the dragoon myself, never got into FF like some of y'all
[3:37:04] <%That1blindkid> But N*SYNC road adventure tho Kappa
[3:37:05] <pazuuuzuuuu> Was 6 the first FF you played?
[3:37:07] <osuRohan> FFX gang
[3:37:13] <Jetsfantasy> 6 is special because there's no real MC
[3:37:14] <Captainahab_37> isn't Gorky 17 inspired by FF7
[3:37:15] <tacostarvedbeast> did u like 12 at all?
[3:37:21] <Melchior_the_Wise> FF is cool, but y'all ever play Phantasy Star? Kappa
[3:37:29] <pazuuuzuuuu> I hear the first FF you play is usually the favorite
[3:37:30] <Captainahab_37> for those who know what Gorky 17 is lol
[3:37:30] <%Dakuu75> which sprite FF had that summoner that wears all green?
[3:37:36] <Kain5707> D:
[3:37:37] <+DBTenno> I played the crap out of the Legend of Dragoon demo back when demo Playstations were still a thing in stores
[3:37:38] <HotSauceFiend> @Jetsfantasy I would say celeste brought everyone together again, therefore she's the MC?
[3:37:42] <%arcaderabbit48> 9 is fun but kinda suffered from some weird design and development decisions
[3:37:46] <$JoshManVGH> @dakuu75 4
[3:37:50] <%AncelDeLambert> 12 is not good. It has good elements. But it is not good.
[3:37:51] <Mattais88> I can't stand 12's combat
[3:37:51] <$TheNewZealandStory> 12 is fucking boring
[3:37:53] <Wiiplayah43> 12 is overrated as hell IMHO
[3:37:54] <%TheYellowcouch> TheYellowcouch is gifting 10 Tier 1 Subs to PeachSaliva's community! They've gifted a total of 10 in the channel!

[3:37:59] <%That1blindkid> I tricked my friend with XV by saying it was an N*SYNC road trip game
[3:37:59] <+Buzzard42> dodged
[3:38:01] <+Taisuru> 12 is good but it has problems
[3:38:01] <%Dakuu75> god-damn
[3:38:01] <+logoth_> 12 like a bad MMORPG
[3:38:01] <Kain5707> Paige HATES Fran
[3:38:02] <Captainahab_37> 12 is meh but I uh ..like the UI sounds
[3:38:06] <%Dakuu75> doodDah
[3:38:07] <+alternative_flu> I regret playing lightning returns
[3:38:08] <Quikanims> @dbtenno I took one look at his design and immediately realized they had the female fanbase in mind
[3:38:12] <Melchior_the_Wise> was 11 an MMO?
[3:38:13] <AFlyingTaco1> 12 was one of my favorites honestly
[3:38:17] <%Marzby> Pat was a big part of me growing up. now I'm 26 and watch you both weekly. First time having money to subscribe in my life so just wanted to say thanks paige!
[3:38:20] <%arcaderabbit48> I'd rather play 13 than 12.
[3:38:20] <@Jekado> Yeah 11 and 14 are mmos
[3:38:23] <Captainahab_37> I forget about lightning returns
[3:38:24] <@Jekado> and they are both still going
[3:38:34] <$TheNewZealandStory> paige you should use technician itll help you with those skill checks
[3:38:35] <+alternative_flu> i jumped into it without playing the previous two for some reason
[3:38:36] <%MechArch> psaDogchamp
[3:38:39] <$JoshManVGH> 12 is delightful if you enjoy setting up automation.
[3:38:46] <+BoboDaHobo> the world of 12 is interesting but it's a bore to play
[3:38:47] <mr_saturday93> I thought 12 was a mmo
[3:38:49] <HotSauceFiend> Lightning REturns wasn't bad, but I wasn't prepared for sidequest hell
[3:38:54] <%That1blindkid> 13 has good music
[3:38:56] <+logoth_> Nobody likes to think about 13; and that got THREE ENTRIES
[3:38:57] <+alternative_flu> same! it why i picked up the game
[3:38:57] <%That1blindkid> thats about it
[3:38:58] <%Marzby> sorry didn't mean to repost
[3:38:59] <%AncelDeLambert> I have not and will NEVER play 13 or its sequels
[3:39:02] <mr_saturday93> no mention of 15?
[3:39:04] <$TheGreatSkenardo> But would you get topped by Fang?
[3:39:06] <Captainahab_37> what's the final fantasy action game they're making now?
[3:39:08] <AFlyingTaco1> Going back to 13 recently, it's not as bad as I remember it, but it's still lacking in a lot of aspects
[3:39:13] <Captainahab_37> I just call it CHAOS
[3:39:23] <%ssjklyco> Fang should have been main character
[3:39:26] <+swordrey> How u feel about 16
[3:39:29] <+BoboDaHobo> 13 2 was surprisingly good but fuck 13
[3:39:34] <tacostarvedbeast> is chrono cross the one with the timing wheel?
[3:39:37] <+SharpClaw_> 13s story is just horrible, and the characters are unlikable
[3:39:37] <Kain5707> limesO
[3:39:37] <+alternative_flu> I can't listen to Lightning without thinking of Liara T'Soni
[3:39:37] <HotSauceFiend> I remember truly enjoying the ff13-2 combat arena challenges
[3:39:39] <Melchior_the_Wise> FF 16 announced?
[3:39:40] <osuRohan> FF 15 was such a specific experience I personally adored
[3:39:41] <$NitronStreams> Crono cross is fine. Its dumb as hell but its fine
[3:39:42] <Captainahab_37> is yoshi p working on 16?
[3:39:44] <$TheGreatSkenardo> Man this doctor is sleeping
[3:39:44] <+logoth_> Chrono Cross is the one with the UFO
[3:39:44] <%That1blindkid> im sad pat never did ignis dlc
[3:39:45] <+DBTenno> Can't wait for the avalanche of CHAOS-posting when that trainwreck final fantasy arrives. LUL
[3:39:45] <$JoshManVGH> Most of 13s cast would have done more to save the world if they just sat down and did nothing
[3:39:48] <+logoth_> and the luchador
[3:39:48] <%peyodogo> hey chrono cross is real nice, the music rocks
[3:39:58] <Noahccountingfortaste> man, lotta Docs tonight
[3:39:58] <$TheNewZealandStory> chrono cross only has music and aesthetics going for it, the gameplay and writing are terrible
[3:40:00] <$JoshManVGH> Chrono Cross was SO damn cool!
[3:40:01] <RickyRelucent> whats the one ps2 game, fucking arc something
[3:40:04] <@Jekado> Paige I forgot are you thinking of playing FF origins when it comes out?
[3:40:08] <+logoth_> Arc the Lad
[3:40:09] <RickyRelucent> with the stories about a human and a demon
[3:40:15] <%arcaderabbit48> He laugh
[3:40:15] <RickyRelucent> and the demon had a fucking frog stepfather
[3:40:17] <Captainahab_37> Shadow Hearts was cool
[3:40:18] <$JoshManVGH> the music in that game is to die for
[3:40:20] <blue8moon> Yoshi P is the producer of FF16, and the team working on it is mainly the team that did the HW expac of 14
[3:40:22] <%arcaderabbit48> He has himself a giggle
[3:40:27] <wibbwobbler> I love a good story but I’m usually drawn to characters
[3:40:28] <tacostarvedbeast> feel by bunch clench up on that one
[3:40:28] <%Marzby> How much to get Toby Fox to make a Papyrus game ?
[3:40:28] <Laioken13> he had a free hit and botched it lol
[3:40:29] <pazuuuzuuuu> Doki doki panic
[3:40:33] <Kain5707> Paige what do you think of Y'shtola?
[3:40:34] <+SharpClaw_> arc the lad ?
[3:40:38] <@SoFarFetched> DONT GIVE HIM FREE SHOCKS
[3:40:44] <@Jekado> why are you letting him build meter
[3:40:46] <Melchior_the_Wise> was that a glitch?
[3:40:46] <@SoFarFetched> LUL
[3:40:50] <$TheNewZealandStory> wow this doctor very bad
[3:40:50] <@SoFarFetched> he's got shadowborne
[3:40:50] <codyppp1> very good po sweetheart opo
[3:40:53] <phantomsleeves> paige no
[3:40:53] <GuyverTypeL> @peachsaliva try Phantasy Star 4 someday, has good characters
[3:40:54] <@SoFarFetched> sorry I mean lightborn
[3:40:55] <+Taisuru> Lightborne?
[3:41:13] <Melchior_the_Wise> yeah, Phantasy Star 4 got them good JRPG vibes without too much Jank
[3:41:13] <mr_saturday93> I feel like the flashlight needs a buff cause of shit like that
[3:41:22] <Captainahab_37> did y'all ever play digimon world
[3:41:31] <TurtlesAndTentacles> It was fake and then it wasnt
[3:41:37] <Captainahab_37> either people love it or fuckin hate it
[3:41:42] <%Marzby> Paige what your favourite modern horror ?
[3:41:46] <+Kiaayo> outplayed
[3:41:48] <$TheGreatSkenardo> to be fair you have wasted a lot of his time
[3:41:56] <Melchior_the_Wise> W I G G L E
[3:41:57] <+SharpClaw_> got alot of time for the team though
[3:41:59] <phantomsleeves> he lost so many gens
[3:42:01] <%Marzby> film or game
[3:42:05] <TurtlesAndTentacles> Paige you gotta break the pattern lol. i think he caught on to how you were running lol
[3:42:06] <@SoFarFetched> Im half expecting NOED on this doctor.
[3:42:11] <%Marzby> YES
[3:42:16] <@Jekado> sometimes its all about wasting killers time for the others to do gens
[3:42:18] <Captainahab_37> Clock Tower 3 looked weird
[3:42:18] <$TheNewZealandStory> which clock tower 2
[3:42:19] <%LastHazzerd> it's not modern but it is well known
[3:42:29] <Captainahab_37> I wish I could play Rule of Rose
[3:42:33] <hearingthenseeing> ... is the a gay flag on that death hook lol
[3:42:37] <+DBTenno> Clock Tower 3 definitely weird with its magical girl boss battles
[3:42:39] <Melchior_the_Wise> better than Phantasmagoria?
[3:42:40] <hearingthenseeing> there*
[3:42:40] <@SoFarFetched> Yeah its a pride charm
[3:42:44] <@SoFarFetched> for pride month
[3:42:48] <%Marzby> Phasmaphobia
[3:42:48] <+CaptainDerpies> @hearingthenseeing yeah you can get a pride flag charm
[3:42:50] <$TheNewZealandStory> there are two clock tower 2s, one of them is very bad
[3:42:54] <Zeif00> dbd said gay rights
[3:42:56] <phantomsleeves> sometimes killers be gay
[3:43:01] <%TheYellowcouch> Gay WRATH
[3:43:03] <Melchior_the_Wise> nah man its about Phantasmagoria
[3:43:06] <Sotetsu> PrideHeartL PrideHeartR
[3:43:06] <Kain5707> LUL
[3:43:07] <Captainahab_37> you sure the hook isn't an ally?
[3:43:08] <$TheNewZealandStory> @Captainahab_37 i dont recommend it
[3:43:10] <+Astrobstrd> Diversity win! The deranged doctor that just put a hook through your shoulder is gay
[3:43:10] <$JoshManVGH> The Babadook, LGBT icon.
[3:43:11] <%peyodogo> doc said gay rights :' )
[3:43:18] <tacostarvedbeast> is space jam worth the watch?
[3:43:19] <hearingthenseeing> well at least I'll be accepted as I'm brutally murdered
[3:43:31] <HotSauceFiend> Space Jam 1 or 2
[3:43:37] <Captainahab_37> @thenewzealandstory rule of rose or Clock Tower 3?
[3:43:37] <Zaphire_Saucypants> No better crime than gay war crimes.
[3:43:39] <+Gondab> I've had the doctor's rich guy skin on for so long I forget what the origional looked like.
[3:43:43] <$TheGreatSkenardo> Like I said, you wasted a lot of his time
[3:43:45] <Kain5707> Paige when are you going to have new Adam stories for us?
[3:43:54] <%Marzby> Apparently space jam 2 suck so bad
[3:43:54] <+DBTenno> They should have all the killers include a "gay rights" voiceline. Gotta have Nemesis shout "GAY RIGHTS" before punching Jill. LUL
[3:43:56] <Melchior_the_Wise> just play the true sequel to Space jam @tacostarvedbeast Shut up and Jam Gaiden
[3:44:01] <$TheNewZealandStory> @Captainahab_37 rule of rose, combat is beyond frustrating
[3:44:06] <%Dakuu75> I mean. the doc does have those dreamy stappled-wide-open bedroom eyes
[3:44:07] <phantomsleeves> oh no is this a three gen
[3:44:24] <@SoFarFetched> "Healing,THATS FOR SUCKERS!"
[3:44:26] <Captainahab_37> huh, the story looks interesting so I'll WATCH rule of rose
[3:44:30] <%lemon_rinds> Why does it sound like an orgy is going on??
[3:44:35] <hearingthenseeing> Dwight you ignorant slut
[3:44:36] <%arcaderabbit48> And the Doc's come-hither grimace. He makes the air positively electric!
[3:44:49] <%Dakuu75> is there a Wendigo killer?
[3:44:52] <$TheGreatSkenardo> time to scoot
[3:44:55] <Melchior_the_Wise> Ghost Dicks everwhere
[3:44:58] <Captainahab_37> I'm not shocked Space Jam 2 sucks
[3:45:04] <@SoFarFetched> called it
[3:45:05] <@SoFarFetched> NOED
[3:45:06] <Captainahab_37> it doesn't have Barkley
[3:45:10] <phantomsleeves> JUST GO
[3:45:13] <Mythematical> Hiiiiii! I can't watch survivor streams because I'm a killer player so they bore me to tears, so I'm just here to say we love you and then I'll sink into the fucking backrooms
[3:45:20] <ValHollaYoloson> NOED gamer
[3:45:23] <+Gondab> I wish there was a killer that thought all the survivors were demon possesed creatures.
[3:45:33] <+DBTenno> In other news, you or Pat plan on getting a Steam Deck?
[3:45:43] <Captainahab_37> They should just make a Shut up and Jam film
[3:45:52] <%ShockzNDrawe> what the fuck is this
[3:45:54] <HotSauceFiend> I wouldn't mind seeing a Spider based killer. If we are going based on horror characters and fears
[3:45:57] <%arcaderabbit48> We really need an evil priest killer in this game. I know there is The Plague, but that's not really the same thing
[3:46:06] <Melchior_the_Wise> Shut up and Jam is the best JRPG of the decade
[3:46:10] <@SoFarFetched> yeah thats been happening alot paige
[3:46:10] <$Dutchpotato> It’s such a bad name
[3:46:12] <@SoFarFetched> you're not the first

[3:46:18] <@Jekado> I hate stream deck and stream deck the names are too CLOSE
[3:46:20] <+DBTenno> Or "Gabe-boy" as people started to call it. LUL
[3:46:20] <Captainahab_37> steam Deck is a horrible name
[3:46:22] <Jetsfantasy> Doesn't help Elgato announced a new Stream Deck a few hours after Valve's Steam Deck
[3:46:27] <%peyodogo> a spider killer would make me not watch dbd anymore
[3:46:28] <$NitronStreams> Valve knew what they were doing with that name
[3:46:29] <tacostarvedbeast> but think of all the gams peach, 8 GAMS
[3:46:31] <Paperware> Switch Pad Pro
[3:46:33] <%arcaderabbit48> Fish man killer when?
[3:46:39] <HotSauceFiend> But thats the point, if this is a horror game, go spiders
[3:46:40] <%ShockzNDrawe> I mean
[3:46:41] <hearingthenseeing> they should have the Candyman... or do they
[3:46:42] <%ShockzNDrawe> do they
[3:46:42] <Mattais88> Shelob
[3:46:44] <+LensWander> Imagine the doctor from The Human Centipede as a killer

[3:50:51] <%ShockzNDrawe> have you ever rea dthe IDW comics
[3:50:56] <TurtlesAndTentacles> Paige are you actually a furry? No trolling, Im genuinely curious
[3:50:57] <Zaphire_Saucypants> how about...a Beast Wars podcast between Paige and Plague's vtubers? Farm cat and fox lady.
[3:51:10] <+DBTenno> I was right there w/ Star Wars Theory when he teared up seeing that certain scene at the end of the Mandalorian

[3:52:08] <+rivercitydemon> Thank God Beast Wars is on Tubi
[3:52:13] <%ShockzNDrawe> I'll fucking talk about beast machines
[3:52:14] <TurtlesAndTentacles> BEAST MACHINE IS AWESOME
[3:52:15] <Laioken13> how is it a mystery when she simps for garrus and asked someone to draw a lewd garrus
[3:52:16] <DareTheJackal> Yeeeeah.
[3:52:22] <RickyRelucent> could just said, or rather announced YES
[3:52:28] <$JoshManVGH> The Dan Avidan Defense: "I'm not a furry...but..."
[3:52:30] <Captainahab_37> do vtubers mean we're on the road to SHODAN
[3:52:32] <dan_g_v> ya kno
[3:52:34] <%samTUMZfestival> @Melchior_the_Wise He says he would make it legal if it "pleasures the animal".....
[3:52:38] <tanarath> Beast Machines had decent animation, at least.
[3:52:39] <%That1blindkid> @Laioken13 EVERYONE IS GARRUSEXUAL
[3:52:44] <$DensityD> they can't call it Space Jam 2. It's Space Joam New leGacy or something

[3:53:04] <+Grayhammatter> david uh
[3:53:07] <Tracazoid> Poor Rhinox
[3:53:14] <TurtlesAndTentacles> Also I hope I wasnt being rude by asking. Damn I actually feel bad now for asking that on stream
[3:53:21] <Captainahab_37> Yeast Machines and all they do is uh... make....bread?
[3:53:27] <Melchior_the_Wise> only 3 rows down and already seeing R34 of Blackarchnia...
[3:53:29] <%ShockzNDrawe> I like the themes of Beast Machines, but they were a little too complex to coer in a show like that
[3:53:35] <Captainahab_37> whatever yeast does, they do it!
[3:53:35] <%Dakuu75> that fucking meme of Rhinox transforming. but, it's some dude screaming in agony. fucking slayed me
[3:53:37] <%samTUMZfestival> I got too far down the rabbit hole, but there are levels. Peach isn't hurting anyone.
[3:53:41] <%arcaderabbit48> But Beast Machines had Dragon Megatron tho
[3:53:43] <+Taisuru> The designs were almost all fugly as sin too
[3:53:55] <%ssjklyco> They ruined the characters personalities. Rhinox may as well have been dead
[3:54:23] <$JoshManVGH> I just remember Optimus becoming new age, and the rat having some sorty of Transfomal Dysfunction.
[3:54:23] <tanarath> a
[3:54:27] <%arcaderabbit48> "Being a nazi is actually awesome!" said Rhinox apparently??
[3:54:27] <TurtlesAndTentacles> I loved everything about Beast Machines. Screw Rhinox
[3:54:31] <RetroCop87> I was always more into the Donkey Kong show than Beast Wars
[3:54:32] <tanarath> The toy was GREAT TOO
[3:54:33] <markdreizehn> Silverbot, Rhinox, Optimus and Ratrap all got destroyed by Beast Machines
[3:54:36] <Captainahab_37> beast machines look l
[3:54:36] <%samTUMZfestival> Good "Feel Bad" entertainment.
[3:54:37] <SpottyJJ> wait paige has a vtuber model now??? DOPE

[3:56:06] <President_Pariah> i'm playing killer while you're a survivor, Peach, and it's FUCKING me up hearing skill checks as a killer
[3:56:10] <Noahccountingfortaste> God I love Blight
[3:56:12] <SpottyJJ> blight, more like butt. GOTTEM
[3:56:18] <+Gondab> No one is as fast as 90MPH Billy

[3:56:32] <President_Pariah> i'm like, "did i come across the BIGGEST BUG?!"
[3:56:42] <$mister___doctor> Hey Pai- oh sweet Christ I forgot
[3:56:45] <Melchior_the_Wise> except 100 mph billy @Gondab
[3:56:46] <Captainahab_37> at least you ran faster than him
[3:56:54] <%arcaderabbit48> Blight's skills are cool but they seem like kind of a waste for an alchemist type killer? Should have been a pinball werewolf instead
[3:57:00] <RetroCop87> like monkeys picking fleas
[3:57:02] <Dave_VD> I wish I got to sit next to Rich Evans...
[3:57:03] <tacostarvedbeast> i dig paiges vtuber vibe
[3:57:12] <Ryuga409> Hello PeachSaliva how are you

[3:58:34] <%CubicPhantom> speedrun strats, right
[3:58:39] <Melchior_the_Wise> So the v-tubing is because Paige is horribly burned on most of her body?
[3:58:44] <Melchior_the_Wise> is that what I'm gathering
[3:58:58] <HotSauceFiend> @very wise of you to deduce that

[4:14:32] <Captainahab_37> does TLOU2 not have multiplayer?

[4:18:30] <%AncelDeLambert> Paige, that shitshow was a message from your brain
[4:18:30] <blue8moon> elmo does not wish you to play
[4:18:36] <Pavel_Stuchlik> Elmo thinks: "Mission complete!"
[4:18:37] <brisk_dacat> Pet kitty first
[4:18:41] <tanarath> It's bad luck not to pet him
[4:18:47] <%arcaderabbit48> I can't believe Paige was beaten by a Killer that doesnt exist and nobody plays
[4:18:53] <@SoFarFetched> oh no her vtuber
[4:18:56] <HotSauceFiend> end this with a aFreddy stream
[4:18:58] <+GloweyEyes_Sapphire> what is the cat doing?
[4:19:08] <PinoProxie> "my work here is done..."
[4:19:10] <bigrocksalt> make elmo vtuber please
[4:19:19] <blue8moon> he left because you weren't in a match so he can't distract you from it
[4:19:20] <tanarath> scratching paige, jumping on the keyboard, etc
[4:19:20] <brisk_dacat> He’ll get his love from pat now
[4:19:22] <Captainahab_37> Can you KILL the killer?
[4:19:28] <xifaithfull> Hey

[4:20:04] <zavi_dior> Aight heading out goodnight everyone <3
[4:20:06] <TonyBStreaming> So you can be a dick to the killer. A fate worse than death.
[4:20:08] <@SoFarFetched> he's definitely better after his buff
[4:20:13] <%arcaderabbit48> I'm convinced they'll eventually add a method to kill the Killer.
[4:20:14] <Noahccountingfortaste> they do? that's interesting
[4:20:17] <Faustgesicht> Because he's shy
[4:20:17] <brandonl1152> What about a flash bang
[4:20:20] <brisk_dacat> Didnt they use to have firecrackers?

[4:20:52] <lloyddboy> Kreygasm
[4:20:55] <Naho_Saenoki> I keep calling him Philip, since I went out of my way to learn each Killer's real name. SOmetimes I actually forget their title.
[4:20:56] <+tkzhyon> monkaS

[4:22:40] <%AncelDeLambert> ... does a lot even exist?
[4:22:41] <TonyBStreaming> Covid and Furries don't seem to mesh great
[4:22:48] <Faustgesicht> I see legion is pretty popular too
[4:22:48] <%topendbuzza> willing to share? Kappa
[4:22:50] <doge2944> StinkyCheese
[4:22:50] <+Taisuru> Paige, mouth the number and let's see if the v-tuber can convey it
[4:22:52] <tanarath> At least 100
[4:22:54] <stantheman_97> like a cemetery's worth
[4:22:57] <%AncelDeLambert> a whole two, folks, she got TWO
[4:23:00] <Captainahab_37> all porn is skeleton porn if you think about it
[4:23:02] <@Jekado> More then you think but less then you'd hope.
[4:23:05] <Captainahab_37> mostly organs tho
[4:23:06] <satans_finest_millennial> its one a book seller? Kappa
[4:23:10] <%arcaderabbit48> R-Rated stream where you read skeleporn when?
[4:23:11] <+Taisuru> Hehe
[4:23:16] <goatcommander717> the joy in your voice says it was enough
[4:23:16] <@Jekado> @Captainahab_37 what about slime porn.
[4:23:22] <HotSauceFiend> Do you know any skeleton based V-tubers
[4:23:27] <satans_finest_millennial> that is correct lol
[4:23:28] <@Jekado> yes she does
[4:23:32] <%topendbuzza> on stream reading?
[4:23:33] <Coystick> Do crying eyes with a smiling face, that will convey it
[4:23:33] <%ShockzNDrawe> monstergirls are neat
[4:23:37] <satans_finest_millennial> cinnomon bone
[4:23:39] <Noahccountingfortaste> Kon's great

[4:24:04] <%arcaderabbit48> C A K E
[4:24:13] <Captainahab_37> don't wake up it's like 1:30
[4:24:16] <@SoFarFetched> wake up? more like go to bed after this
[4:24:28] <h3ctareas> can you still get into this game ?
[4:24:29] <+MightyDuckShoes> Ironman Peach
[4:24:35] <%ShockzNDrawe> so since the debut have you had any other vtubers crawl out of the woodwork to suddenly insist hat you collab
[4:24:42] <%arcaderabbit48> We really do need a skeleton killer for DbD
[4:24:44] <HotSauceFiend> I have never seen anyone play twins this whole anniversary season
[4:24:45] <TonyBStreaming> How was the Res Evil stuff?
[4:24:58] <@Jekado> @arcaderabbit48 SPINAL for DbD!
[4:25:00] <+Gondab> Also the infinate bloodpoint grind.
[4:25:05] <@SoFarFetched> yeah Ive gotten a couple of Twins
[4:25:14] <HotSauceFiend> THAT MAP is a nightmare
[4:25:21] <@SoFarFetched> Resident Evil map should be enabled again geefThink you just can't use a map offering
[4:25:23] <HotSauceFiend> its perfect for Ghosface
[4:25:27] <luca_jn> Wasn't the RPD re-enabled?
[4:25:28] <%arcaderabbit48> Like, I'm kinda surprised so many classics don't have representation yet? No werewolf, no skeleton, no lake monster, but boy we got Conjoined Twins and whatever the fuck Blight is!
[4:25:31] <Captainahab_37> not tight like COOL then?
[4:25:32] <+Gondab> The map is AWEFUL for any ranged killer
[4:25:36] <$mield916> RPPD isnt out just not summonable
[4:25:42] <Captainahab_37> not tight like Beast Wars is TIGHT
[4:25:44] <luca_jn> I've played on it like ten times in the past week
[4:25:50] <@SoFarFetched> yeah I like how the RPD badge is already retired
[4:25:51] <Faustgesicht> Have you play against a trickster since the rework?
[4:26:08] <CurrySauseBandit> This map is not great as Huntress.
[4:26:08] <Captainahab_37> is this Francis from Friday the Elmteenth?
[4:26:17] <HotSauceFiend> Trickster feels like a weak huntress, not sure about this re-work
[4:26:17] <President_Pariah> i just got into DBD this week, READ THE MANUAL. it has a bunch of details on game mechanics the tutorial leaves out
[4:26:22] <Captainahab_37> Friday on Elm street
[4:26:28] <@SoFarFetched> the PTB for trickster definitely buffs him
[4:26:28] <Noahccountingfortaste> Trickster has some big changes coming in a week or 2
[4:26:30] <+alternative_flu> omg i cant believe you're playing with the jarule
[4:26:34] <@Jekado> the rework people seem to think is too strong
[4:26:39] <@Jekado> i think its still in ptb
[4:26:46] <@SoFarFetched> yeah still PTB
[4:26:46] <TonyBStreaming> @president_pariah there's a manual?
[4:26:55] <Noahccountingfortaste> I HOPE he is stronger soon, I'm having fun with him even now on the live servers
[4:27:01] <%arcaderabbit48> What's the Trickster rework, and is this the fast a character has ever gotten a rework in something? The dude just came out like a month ago
[4:27:01] <Noahccountingfortaste> a buff would be nice
[4:27:02] <@SoFarFetched> I assume the manual is for the console version of DbD
[4:27:03] <Captainahab_37> does ptb mean pet the baby?
[4:27:04] <President_Pariah> yeah, the Getting Started button or w/e

[4:29:23] <President_Pariah> tutorial also starts you out w/ almost 1 mil bloodpoints, least it did for me, enough to level several characters out the gate
[4:29:30] <%SharKinStereo> sipsipHellmo sipsipHellmo sipsipHellmo
[4:29:39] <President_Pariah> then everyone's using cakes so getting like 50k+ pts a match to level others
[4:29:46] <Captainahab_37> hide like a coward it's the only way!
[4:29:50] <HotSauceFiend> Is the thing about Cats intentionally falling asleep on keyboards real?
[4:29:55] <@SoFarFetched> tutorial I think gave 200k BP geefThink cause 1 mil is like the max BP
[4:30:03] <phantomsleeves> ooh she might have one shot hatchets be careful paige
[4:30:04] <%ShockzNDrawe> among us
[4:30:08] <Captainahab_37> cowards live, heroes doe
[4:30:11] <Captainahab_37> die*
[4:30:24] <President_Pariah> i had 900k after just completing tutorial, might've be anniversary thing
[4:30:27] <Captainahab_37> I almost misspelled heroes as herpes
[4:30:35] <@SoFarFetched> oh yeah definitely anniversary then cause it gave bloodpoints
[4:30:54] <TonyBStreaming> @hotsaucefiend kinda. Cats like mimicking what their owners are doing, so if you're focusing on a keyboard, they'll also like being on the keyboard
[4:31:09] <%AncelDeLambert> what's happening is that inside maps SUCK and it's impossible to find the damn things
[4:31:14] <CurrySauseBandit> I'm assuming the other 3 are also not doing gens like you are sooooo.
[4:31:42] <CurrySauseBandit> c:
[4:31:50] <Captainahab_37> eyes peeled inside that locker yeah
[4:32:06] <+CaptainDerpies> just hold m1 5head

[4:32:32] <+Angelnickl> I just got here, you have been streaming for quite a while. Good to see you.
[4:32:54] <Captainahab_37> that was a jump scare
[4:32:55] <phantomsleeves> that zarina came sliding in there
[4:33:01] <%AncelDeLambert> 4.5 hours, now
[4:33:11] <$Zero_Awakening> the pitter-patter of survivors running is so weird to me (only play killer)

[4:33:18] <%Marg0Pol0> Marg0Pol0 subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 9 months! Thanks for so much good content! Also, you should make a little vTuber companion for Pat when he's around. Maybe just an cartoon version of him from the eyes up next to you?
[4:33:24] <captain_elsewhere> hello sweeties imagin46Love
[4:33:26] <TonyBStreaming> But how, you're an anime now
[4:33:28] <+LensWander> Are those pallets that are lit up? What perk is that?
[4:33:30] <%AncelDeLambert> Fetched just use the emote tab, LUL
[4:33:37] <Captainahab_37> the pat VTuber is only the top of his head
[4:33:38] <Pavel_Stuchlik> You're a trooper, Paige, and an inspiration.
[4:33:42] <Jetsfantasy> !hydrate Kappa
[4:34:10] <+Angelnickl> Water is so terribly good for you. Doctors hate it.
[4:34:13] <@SoFarFetched> no I refuse geefNo
[4:34:14] <A_Sham> Just add in Hydration Bot. :D
[4:34:17] <@SoFarFetched> Imma type it out
[4:34:24] <%SharKinStereo> hm, I wonder if windows works for knowing if a pallet is fake, like against doctor
[4:34:35] <@SoFarFetched> Freddie c an also do fake pallets
[4:34:42] <@SoFarFetched> Its hilarious when you slam it down and it turns into kool aid
[4:35:00] <HotSauceFiend> doesnt doctor also have fake pallets
[4:35:02] <Captainahab_37> huntress got "bars"
[4:35:17] <%SharKinStereo> FailFish
[4:35:20] <Captainahab_37> are crows sound traps?
[4:35:21] <@SoFarFetched> paige confirms doesn't wanna heal women geefPlz
[4:35:22] <captain_elsewhere> yes @HotSauceFiend
[4:35:25] <%AncelDeLambert> @Captainahab_37 yes
[4:35:26] <TonyBStreaming> Ngl, knowing nothing about DBD Huntress is creeping me out
[4:35:38] <+TopTieramisu> welp
[4:35:49] <captain_elsewhere> she throws hatchets @TonyBStreaming
[4:35:51] <@SoFarFetched> @Captainahab_37 crows can let the killer know if someone passed by recently. There's a perk where you get notified by the crow if someone ran past.
[4:35:53] <Captainahab_37> the crows in Hunt Showdown make me hate crows
[4:35:56] <HotSauceFiend> Haha, i thought of an evil killer ability. Throw down a fake hatch
[4:36:01] <+Angelnickl> There is a hydrate channel point reward thing in your dashboard. We can remind you.
[4:36:06] <@SoFarFetched> ELMO CRAVES VIOLENCE
[4:36:07] <Noahccountingfortaste> he screm,
[4:36:08] <TonyBStreaming> @captain_elsewhere yo that's cool!
[4:36:08] <@SoFarFetched> psaGib
[4:36:11] <%ShockzNDrawe> good that fucking singing is driving me insane
[4:36:13] <Coystick> LET HIM PEE
[4:36:13] <%Dakuu75> He too strong
[4:36:18] <%ShockzNDrawe> like at least sing something good fucker
[4:36:20] <Pavel_Stuchlik> I had a fever and a headache all day yesterday as a result of my second Covid shot. You'd just shrug something minor like that off, Paige, and still be as entertaining as a comedy club.
[4:36:30] <%AncelDeLambert> LUL how is it this hard to find a gen to fix
[4:36:35] <brisk_dacat> Cat you give Elmo a cat toy??
[4:36:41] <Coystick> He HATES it
[4:36:45] <+TopTieramisu> omg, that's elmo?
[4:36:46] <Captainahab_37> Migraines STINK
[4:36:48] <+TopTieramisu> sounds like an actual infant
[4:36:50] <captain_elsewhere> damn you lucky @Pavel_Stuchlik i was out for like 3 days
[4:37:06] <%AncelDeLambert> RUUUUUUUN
[4:37:06] <@SoFarFetched> yeah shes more focused on the meg
[4:37:08] <Captainahab_37> thinking about migraines and headaches give me headaches am I crazy
[4:37:10] <%Dakuu75> that was a help
[4:37:22] <phantomsleeves> there was a gen downstairs
[4:37:23] <Captainahab_37> well, crazier
[4:37:24] <Kokobang> flashlight help!
[4:37:34] <+TopTieramisu> is the layout randomized?
[4:37:35] <captain_elsewhere> good attempt
[4:37:38] <Pavel_Stuchlik> @captain_elsewhere I sweated my pajamas, bed sheet and pillow through and through.
[4:37:46] <%arcaderabbit48> You want a Hale or a Lawernce?
[4:37:52] <%AncelDeLambert> this has gotten tense
[4:37:57] <captain_elsewhere> no @TopTieramisu this is one of the maps that has very little randomiziation
[4:37:59] <phantomsleeves> and hooks
[4:38:01] <HotSauceFiend> some elements are randomized
[4:38:04] <+Angelnickl> There is a hydrate channel point reward thing in your dashboard. We can remind you to take a sippy sip of water.
[4:38:14] <Captainahab_37> has the Huntress even SEEN you during this game?
[4:38:28] <Captainahab_37> greatest soldier in the world, PeachSaliva
[4:38:34] <%AncelDeLambert> LUL LUL LUL
[4:38:39] <+alternative_flu> too spicey
[4:38:49] <%AncelDeLambert> BIG PAIGE
[4:38:52] <HotSauceFiend> this map is not the best for our dear huntress
[4:38:54] <$Zero_Awakening> tlexScare
[4:38:57] <phantomsleeves> this huntress is not interested in paige wow
[4:38:58] <A_Sham> Hey, hiding is like, the biggest part of soldiering. Like, seriously. :D
[4:39:11] <%SharKinStereo> pretty sure huntress is following u
[4:39:18] <Captainahab_37> I just have no memory
[4:39:22] <CurrySauseBandit> I totally forgot where it was too LUL
[4:39:28] <+RenoDeGeneric> One lonely unloved generator
[4:39:30] <captain_elsewhere> kinda 50/50 @HotSauceFiend the corridors mean its easy for short stuff but longer range is almost completely out the question
[4:39:34] <%AncelDeLambert> this map SUCKS I hate it
[4:39:39] <+Angelnickl> Huntress is the only killer I would play. Bad at killer though.
[4:39:39] <$Zero_Awakening> Nemesis does quite well here in my games
[4:39:39] <%arcaderabbit48> Can Nurse teleport through walls?
[4:39:44] <%AncelDeLambert> indoor maps are bad for Trapper, I do not like
[4:39:46] <%SharKinStereo> does huntress even want her last BBQ stack?
[4:39:46] <luca_jn> worst part about this map is the 8000 pallets, if you're playing killer.
[4:39:50] <captain_elsewhere> yes @arcaderabbit48
[4:39:55] <brandonl1152> I would think that the last gen would be done by now
[4:40:01] <HotSauceFiend> THis map is fantastic when I wanna be evil with Spirit
[4:40:03] <@Jekado> and nurse can teleport throught floors
[4:40:11] <@SoFarFetched> yeah she gets HUGE fatigue
[4:40:12] <@Jekado> and SHE CAN TELEPORT THROUGH THE ENDGATE
[4:40:13] <+Dobster4221> god why is it always so calming when huntress starts humming?
[4:40:14] <@SoFarFetched> you need add-ons to make it less harsh
[4:40:17] <%ShockzNDrawe> I hate this bitch's humming
[4:40:31] <Captainahab_37> "we're" you mean you
[4:40:35] <%AncelDeLambert> Greatest gen mechanic in the world, BIG PAIGE
[4:40:40] <HotSauceFiend> 50/50 people like or hate the humming in this chat alone
[4:40:40] <%CubicPhantom> I hated it until I played her a bit
[4:40:40] <+alternative_flu> go get the fuck outta there hurry!
[4:40:43] <+alternative_flu> oh god
[4:40:44] <A_Sham> It's great. It's kind of a meta-mechanic, adding actual stress to the player. :D
[4:40:54] <captain_elsewhere> yeah when you hit 1000 hours with nursse is when you can actually play her elaKek
[4:40:55] <+Angelnickl> Her humming is calming to me. Creepy, but calming.
[4:40:58] <%samTUMZfestival> Use your FORESKIN FLASHLIGHT
[4:41:04] <+baconb2587> WE ARE WINNING RIGHT?

[4:42:16] <phantomsleeves> aw they’re trying
[4:42:23] <+Soliloquy123> This game really needs a way to tell teammates "Don't bother, let me die"
[4:42:26] <@SoFarFetched> Paige why not follow the Zarina LUL
[4:42:28] <phantomsleeves> that was so good of them
[4:42:29] <%AncelDeLambert> PAIGE FOLLOW THEM
