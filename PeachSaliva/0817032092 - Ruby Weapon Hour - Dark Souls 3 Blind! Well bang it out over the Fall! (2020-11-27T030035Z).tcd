[1:08:04] <%heartlesshealer> do not give her new game + items
[1:08:06] <Shion963> makes co-op easier
[1:08:16] <nutimik> you can't stop invasions unless you play offline
[1:08:16] <%Keyd00d> Yeah I've been wondering what you meant when you talked about the password blocking invading
[1:08:18] <$drabberfaun535> in dark 3 nobody can invade unless she summons help

[1:12:14] <CrouchingHelps> just a tad
[1:12:15] <+depressed_skeleton> A touch
[1:12:15] <IronGlorfindel> it's a little loud
[1:12:16] <+RushUnplugged> it's just pat being a lazy whisperer
[1:12:16] <+JenovasPuppet> Game is a tiny bit loud
[1:12:16] <%BoxNavy> this game is just naturally loud
[1:12:17] <+ChestMimik> It's fine, little loud but whatever
[1:12:18] <+Mitchellsocks> Game volume pretty loud
[1:12:21] <%DemonOfSalt> @Shion963 Yes, but they aren't as bad as people make them out to be.
[1:12:22] <%KeiganOfAstora> A tiny bit, not much

[1:12:47] <CandyCoatedConfection> don't forget the chest
[1:12:47] <benjiFG> that's good
[1:12:48] <Aydarkzero> ye
[1:12:48] <stabbityrabbit> He sounds like he's dying.
[1:12:49] <+CptCreampuff16> great
[1:12:49] <$i_am_therydon> paige your to afraid to attack somethimes
[1:12:53] <+depressed_skeleton> Kill something, its usually the dying stuff that overpowers.
[1:12:55] <%KeiganOfAstora> Chest!!!
[1:12:57] <%blue8moon> she totally missed the chest, yep
[1:12:59] <+JenovasPuppet> Can't tell until we hear the enemies scream
[1:13:05] <+CptCreampuff16> i think its just the backstab noise thats loud af
[1:13:06] <%BoxNavy> she missed a chest oh my goooood
[1:13:07] <Shion963> @demonofsalt I mean I still haven't beaten any of these games, so by default they're god gamers compared
[1:13:07] <SegaDSi> Was this the room where castle super beast was coined or was that a similar room?
[1:13:14] <Broken_Sonex> I wonder how Reggie will fair. Better than Paige? It's his first time going through so we'll see.
[1:13:15] <+Mitchellsocks> that chest is almost invisible
[1:13:19] <+RalvrWuff> I thought Paige wanted the HUD to be always on. Did she change her mind?
[1:13:27] <nutimik> that was in irythil
[1:13:30] <Vulgar_Prophet> Is that Plague I hear?
[1:13:31] <%KeiganOfAstora> Near Road of Sacrifices right?
[1:13:35] <+JenovasPuppet> F
[1:13:36] <DavidSanChan> purple
[1:13:40] <DracaenaLeaf> cornered
[1:13:42] <$Sphincter_Spelunker> this isn't bloodborne, stop facefucking
[1:13:44] <+fraillightning> did she win?
[1:13:47] <%DemonOfSalt> Good.
[1:13:48] <benjiFG> still kinda loud
[1:13:49] <+JenovasPuppet> Better sound thank you
[1:13:50] <%KeiganOfAstora> souunds fine
[1:13:51] <+Dunmarkh> we'll get that chest next time bois
[1:13:53] <+Invlux> I was gonna say Bloodborne, but that was The Party Cave
[1:13:53] <%BoxNavy> yeah
[1:13:54] <benjiFG> idk it might just be me
[1:13:55] <+fraillightning> sounds excellent
[1:13:56] <%KeiganOfAstora> ONE GUY
[1:13:56] <+ChestMimik> The Boruto Valley
[1:13:56] <Dr_Mooose> fine
[1:13:59] <+RushUnplugged> it's good
[1:14:02] <blackbaron98> Just got back, she's still in the castle?
[1:14:02] <%a_c_chirns> still loud to me, but I have the FFZ compressor or whatever?
[1:14:05] <+depressed_skeleton> Maybe just a Touch loud, but eh.
[1:14:07] <$i_am_therydon> it was the dungeons in ds3 right? or was that the scream lords bit?
[1:14:10] <%DemonOfSalt> We can hear you better, game audio itself is a bit loud still.
[1:14:12] <ghostmcfly6> sound perfect
[1:14:14] <+ChestMimik> I think the game is just naturally weird
[1:14:14] <laserbeaming> It's only loud when the zombie dogs attack
[1:14:19] <%ClericOfSparda> I show up an hour late and Peach is actually playing the game? blasphemy!
[1:14:22] <xanerts> still a little loud
[1:14:24] <%DemonOfSalt> But just barely.
[1:14:24] <snorlaxbud> pat make it a joel stream and just red line it
[1:14:28] <%KeiganOfAstora> Just go into the game settings and lower everything by one
[1:14:32] <Shion963> like some kind of sexy skull
[1:14:40] <promessav2> projectiles are aginst da rules
[1:14:43] <%BoxNavy> there is wood stuck on you
[1:14:46] <%KeiganOfAstora> It's fine

[1:15:33] <%ClericOfSparda> no she just backtracked

[1:17:09] <masterpoloko> ohh?
[1:17:10] <SegaDSi> oh
[1:17:10] <@commanderclaw> sipsipSipsipblind
[1:17:12] <%DemonOfSalt> Nice.
[1:17:13] <Broken_Sonex> FUCKING WOOOOOOOW
[1:17:16] <%KeiganOfAstora> Go back to Knightman. He dropped an item
[1:17:17] <$Sphincter_Spelunker> eyes like a blind hawk
[1:17:19] <+based_lobster> Wow...
[1:17:22] <Vulgar_Prophet> Could listen to Plague all damn day.
[1:17:24] <%KeiganOfAstora> It's worse lo
[1:17:24] <+ChestMimik> Did Paige steal Woolie's Borutogan?
[1:17:25] <snarfoogle> its worse but its better
[1:17:27] <laserbeaming> Weapon Skill instead of parry
[1:17:31] <+Kurt_0> PogChamp PogChamp PogChamp
[1:17:33] <promessav2> get lothirc shield next
[1:17:35] <maskedmook> the first one is better
[1:17:38] <%BoxNavy> ⭕
[1:17:45] <%KeiganOfAstora> As in Parry or Skill
[1:17:46] <+TheFabledAble> @PeachSaliva are you planning to parry? no? then use the shield with the "sword"
[1:17:55] <+ArmoredDeath> dekillPlan
[1:17:58] <Shion963> if she's not gonna parry, then wouldn't the weapon art be better
[1:17:59] <IronGlorfindel> oooh, weapon skill shield
[1:17:59] <deerlearning> better attack with the new one
[1:18:01] <%AncelDeLambert> Paige is gonna want a skill shield
[1:18:04] <xanerts> I didnt even know that
[1:18:05] <%BinaryFireball> I beat the entire game not knowing what plague just said
[1:18:05] <Dao_Puppy> Paige would do better with sheild bash if she doesn't like parrying.
[1:18:06] <spicystarbursts> remind me again why Paige isn't 2-handing?
[1:18:24] <deerlearning> new is better
[1:18:33] <olaksi> shield safety blanket
[1:18:34] <%blue8moon> she is actually using her shield against enemies
[1:18:34] <Broken_Sonex> Did Paige steal Woolie's eyes?
[1:18:35] <snarfoogle> poise enabled
[1:18:35] <%king_wragles> @spicystarbursts Cause she doesn't want to 2 hand
[1:18:50] <+RushUnplugged> @spicystarbursts because then she'd be blocking constantly, duh
[1:18:52] <$Sphincter_Spelunker> unga bunga
[1:18:56] <+based_lobster> YOWZA
[1:18:58] <Shion963> does the shout stagger?
[1:19:00] <+TheFabledAble> it also boosts your dmg
[1:19:03] <Broken_Sonex> Did she think they would be better?
[1:19:03] <SpaceGuntank> it sometimes even has follow ups
[1:19:04] <+HeroSolaire> I never knew this shield did this LMAO
[1:19:11] <nmaten> ds3 parry is ass
[1:19:13] <%KeiganOfAstora> it gives poise too right?
[1:19:13] <%superc37> yes the shout staggerd
[1:19:13] <CandyCoatedConfection> throwing knives
[1:19:14] <primaryfire> there are explosive barrels
[1:19:14] <+ChestMimik> I completely forgot about this mechanic
[1:19:16] <+HeroSolaire> I played through dark souls 3 3 times
[1:19:18] <%blue8moon> got some knives
[1:19:23] <promessav2> yeah there's more of a delay when switching to 2 hand
[1:19:24] <laserbeaming> I just two-hand when I need to use the weapon skill
[1:19:24] <+HeroSolaire> and never knew about this shield shit
[1:19:25] <Pass3rine> Throw a knife
[1:19:27] <Shion963> alluring skull, too
[1:19:27] <+ChestMimik> Kono dio da
[1:19:34] <%JJCheeker> I haven't played this in forever and I completely forgot about the mechanics
[1:19:34] <IronGlorfindel> got firebombs tho
[1:19:36] <%a_c_chirns> gonna step off the edge when she throws
[1:19:39] <%a_c_chirns> 100%

[1:21:04] <%king_wragles> YO
[1:21:04] <SegaDSi> But unga bunga tho
[1:21:07] <%a_c_chirns> I never thought of using them

[1:21:08] <maskedmook> are there pebbles in this game?
[1:21:08] <%cureneckbeard> !uptime
[1:21:08] <valriot> Wait.. is Paige still in this part of the game?
[1:21:08] <promessav2> items = bad
[1:21:14] <%king_wragles> She forced a backstab! She learnin'!
[1:21:14] <laserbeaming> I like the throwing knives
[1:21:17] <IronGlorfindel> I forget, are there pebbles in this game?
[1:21:19] <+fraillightning> is eli a program? what's a eli?

[1:22:12] <%king_wragles> @IronGlorfindel I mean, the knives serve the same purpose but do a bit of damage too
[1:22:16] <+GalacticaPhanto> @alephnoll it really isnt difficult, it's more memorization of enemy patterns and knowing when to hit
[1:22:19] <+Ankation> calculated
[1:22:22] <%king_wragles> BE CAREFUL OF DEEZ NUTS
[1:22:29] <%BoxNavy> safe :)
[1:22:31] <ArkSeaside> plague sounds like my great uncle
[1:22:31] <MyNameIsRasus> Paige hates healing
[1:22:42] <+Ankation> 100% skill
[1:22:44] <%a_c_chirns> Be wary of DEEZ NUTZ
[1:22:44] <%DemonOfSalt> @MyNameIsRasus Naw, she's just learning how.
[1:22:45] <TurtlesAndTentacles> I'm late what did I miss!
[1:22:52] <TurtlesAndTentacles> HAPPY THANKS GIVING.
[1:22:52] <IronGlorfindel> @king_wragles true, but don't show up in the mid-lategame
[1:22:55] <GarbageQueenEllie> Kite shields are pretty, I like them
[1:22:59] <%king_wragles> yaaa, that's fair
[1:23:02] <+Kurt_0> Did she kill the boss yet
[1:23:11] <Alephnoll> @GalacticaPhanto yeah thats true, maybe im just not interested in these types of games
[1:23:12] <%BoxNavy> yeah
[1:23:13] <ArkSeaside> gohelp the rat
[1:23:16] <%Keyd00d> She's starting to believe
[1:23:18] <%FacetiousAF> vordt is big dead
[1:23:18] <%KeiganOfAstora> Except DS2 is more recent than BB lol
[1:23:20] <@SoFarFetched> and then zangief crushes you
[1:23:21] <CyborgAV> Her Power, it's returning!
[1:23:23] <Jolly_Adventurer> She can fell the power within
[1:23:24] <%BoxNavy> when is the bloodborne restream
[1:23:24] <%FacetiousAF> curse-rotted still lives
[1:23:29] <+kvnmck94> bloodborn backstabs were way different tho
[1:23:31] <+twohitgood> DS3 is pretty much DarkBorne
[1:23:35] <%KeiganOfAstora> Item
[1:23:36] <+Mitchellsocks> ayotem
[1:23:37] <%KeiganOfAstora> Item in room
[1:23:43] <%a_c_chirns> R = L
[1:23:45] <+GalacticaPhanto> @alephnoll Its not for everyone. there are certain games I prefer to watch than play
[1:23:46] <+Mitchellsocks> Also 2 missing chests
[1:24:05] <%KeiganOfAstora> What other chests?
[1:24:11] <%blue8moon> stone stairs
[1:24:22] <Alephnoll> @GalacticaPhanto yeah same here lol
[1:24:26] <+Mitchellsocks> there was a chest right there
[1:24:29] <+ChestMimik> spoopy
[1:24:29] <Admiralpoosh> LUL
[1:24:32] <%BoxNavy> Jebaited
[1:24:33] <Shion963> damn ghosts
[1:24:38] <%KeiganOfAstora> That's why she can't play offline LUL
[1:24:39] <@commanderclaw> What's your excuse the rest of the time?
[1:24:41] <Shion963> BLBLBLBL
[1:24:42] <snarfoogle> your brain is receiving a call from diavolo?
[1:24:50] <Monkeyweed21> Happy Thanksgiving!
[1:24:57] <%BoxNavy> oh you got a grene
[1:25:06] <+Mitchellsocks> I don't think it's anything more than a medium use shield, but there's a chest where the dude's chilling too
[1:25:14] <%KeiganOfAstora> useless
[1:25:15] <$Sphincter_Spelunker> @Alephnoll Dark Souls 1 was the most straight forward when I started out. Give that a shot. Don't think I would have kept playing the other games if I hadn't played previous titles.
[1:25:19] <%KeiganOfAstora> No?
[1:25:24] <+Prism_Wing> lol
[1:25:25] <%BinaryFireball> it can be
[1:25:30] <%BoxNavy> that thing sucks for her build i think
[1:25:30] <GarbageQueenEllie> Big X
[1:25:32] <%LiquidDinosaur> \[T]/
[1:25:35] <%KeiganOfAstora> It scales with luck
[1:25:35] <@commanderclaw> I used that sword the whole game as a Faith build
[1:25:36] <Monkeyweed21> its for Solaire
[1:25:38] <Shion963> it's quality faith is it?
[1:25:43] <maskedmook> best series weapon claymore
[1:25:43] <@SoFarFetched> looks like you need more faith
[1:25:44] <%KeiganOfAstora> Nevermind, that's Anri's that scales with luck
[1:25:47] <laserbeaming> I love the Astora Straight Sword. But it's not among the best. It's good for early game!
[1:25:49] <+Mitchellsocks> Sword is busted early game in DS1
[1:25:54] <%BoxNavy> faith stay night
[1:25:56] <+GundamF91> If you pump Faith into it, its good
[1:25:56] <%Fooguwu> six
[1:25:58] <nmaten> thats deep
[1:26:08] <Shion963> I just rock the Dark Sword like a noob
[1:26:08] <Pookiedaexzile> Deep Dark Axe
[1:26:10] <promessav2> faith would probably like faith anyway
[1:26:12] <+pheblorganzardo> "Astora straight sword is a great fait weapon" lmao
[1:26:12] <+Heart0fInk> Best faith str weapon is the dragon slayer axe
[1:26:14] <%KeiganOfAstora> Does it have the health regen?
[1:26:17] <+Mitchellsocks> What even is the other chest in this room?
[1:26:17] <promessav2> paige lol
[1:26:20] <%DemonOfSalt> Paige, your deep. This weapon is cool.
[1:26:20] <+imtth> Who is that talking is that eyepatch ?
[1:26:22] <Aydarkzero> Claymore right away
[1:26:27] <%KeiganOfAstora> What's so good about the Astora Straight Sword?
[1:26:31] <%BinaryFireball> i wish there were more morning stars
[1:26:33] <@SoFarFetched> @imtth plague of gripes
[1:26:37] <%BoxNavy> whoooooa
[1:26:39] <+Heart0fInk> @imtth No. that's woolie
[1:26:41] <Shion963> that's crazy drops
[1:26:41] <+CrimKangaroo> deep axe sounds like an insta tag for thirst traps
[1:26:43] <laserbeaming> The Exile Greatsword is probably my favorite base game weapon
[1:26:46] <+Jaysky> No it's Waldo
[1:26:47] <+imtth> Oh it swoolie
[1:26:47] <+pheblorganzardo> it has a good weapon art, but it's not too crazy
[1:26:54] <AFlyingTaco1> Finding a likeable spear weapon in this game takes a while. Started a new file and it's rough.
[1:27:03] <%BoxNavy> ladd derr
[1:27:07] <BlindGato> And Peach never used weapon arts EVER again
[1:27:07] <%KeiganOfAstora> Lothric Knight Long Spear is best spear tho
[1:27:12] <%KeiganOfAstora> Farm the first area
[1:27:16] <+RushUnplugged> ^
[1:27:17] <+GalacticaPhanto> Wait wasnt she in the settlement?
[1:27:19] <Shion963> past the bad man
[1:27:20] <+Mitchellsocks> @laserbeaming Yeah, i just started a new playthrough in line with hers and am rocking it for the first time
[1:27:25] <%BoxNavy> the bad man
[1:27:27] <+jacewolf_is_the_best> lol

[1:27:48] <akibanoman> paige please press x my ocd
[1:27:51] <Dr_Mooose> large soul of deserted corpse btw
[1:27:53] <maskedmook> I always forget about weapon arts in this game so I never use them
[1:27:54] <nmaten> Large Soul of a Deserted Corpse
[1:27:55] <laserbeaming> @Mitchellsocks It's pretty fun! The weapon art takes a lot of stamina though!
[1:28:06] <megaman_sentinel> lol
[1:28:08] <%FacetiousAF> drink
[1:28:10] <+BigCoffee> LUL LUL LUL LUL
[1:28:10] <%KeiganOfAstora> Super triggered lol
[1:28:13] <SegaDSi> no keep it
[1:28:15] <olaksi> I miss you, [Large Soul of a Deserter Corpse]
[1:28:16] <jowi_time> is the AC out again?
[1:28:17] <+twohitgood> i wanted to see how long the playthrough could go with it up.
[1:28:18] <Monkeyweed21> are you?
[1:28:19] <%white_grimace> god damnit
[1:28:23] <%BoxNavy> it would have been funnier to keep it
[1:28:24] <Pookiedaexzile> Binkie Dick Pat needs a Sleepy little Nap
[1:28:25] <+MisterAvry> You're doing great Paige
[1:28:25] <AFlyingTaco1> The hardest Souls boss - Large Soul of a Something Undead
[1:28:25] <tanarath> You've been doing it for like 2 minutes
[1:28:28] <akibanoman> thanks
[1:28:30] <+deviljhojho_> fuck ups are half the reason i watch dont worry
[1:28:33] <%sumrand0> NEED CONFIDENCE
[1:28:40] <tanarath> but yeah, should have kept it
[1:28:40] <%ClericOfSparda> HAVE CONFIDENCE
[1:28:44] <promessav2> i think it'd be funny if you made paige invade for lift cell key
[1:28:47] <@SoFarFetched> @jowi_time AC in the winter time? It's because Paige injured her back again so no cam.
[1:28:50] <adayuman> farts exposed live
[1:28:54] <+ChestMimik> He
[1:28:55] <AFlyingTaco1> Nah that's fair. Dark Souls 3 is a big step up from 2 in terms of pacing.
[1:28:57] <%FacetiousAF> he is nice man
[1:28:58] <%BoxNavy> i thought she was gonna leave without opening the door
[1:28:58] <+ChestMimik> he cool
[1:28:59] <islandsunn> I like his voice
[1:28:59] <%sumrand0> Grey Rat Best Boi
[1:29:02] <Jolly_Adventurer> He's cool
[1:29:02] <laserbeaming> I like him because he's sad
[1:29:03] <+twohitgood> greirat is a good guy.
[1:29:04] <+NeonLight> Cool boi!
[1:29:04] <%FacetiousAF> paige is gonna give him a bone Kappa
[1:29:06] <Shion963> his voicework is great
[1:29:07] <+Jaysky> He's a cool boy
[1:29:09] <Dr_Mooose> a fine fellow
[1:29:09] <%KeiganOfAstora> His stuttering makes him feel more human
[1:29:12] <%barkon345> damn Paige is really getting good at the From Soft games
[1:29:21] <AFlyingTaco1> Poor Greirat
[1:29:22] <+Jaysky> Even other characters like Gray Rat
[1:29:27] <+Mitchellsocks> Oh I'm a dumbass, she's using the item from the chest i thought they missed
[1:29:29] <Dakuu75> "Town" is a bit of an overexageration
[1:29:30] <$Sphincter_Spelunker> I don't trust him. He's too nice. Kill him
[1:29:34] <+Prism_Wing> I hate his quest
[1:29:40] <%KeiganOfAstora> He sounds so sweet
[1:29:47] <AFlyingTaco1> His quest is pretty annoying, for sure.
[1:29:51] <%KeiganOfAstora> if you had so many wits why'd you get locked up?
[1:29:54] <OneThousandTomatoes> seems trustworthy
[1:29:57] <%BoxNavy> yes :)
[1:29:57] <%LiquidDinosaur> Best character
[1:30:00] <peachy996> It says a lot that a certain other NPC cares about him
[1:30:02] <Shion963> back to the Nexus
[1:30:05] <+Mitchellsocks> I think she's ready to kill the old lady SeemsGood
[1:30:12] <Coystick> he a chap
[1:30:18] <%sumrand0> Even Patches likes Grey Rat! And that dude is essentially a sociopath!!!
[1:30:20] <islandsunn> they give that hat to criminals
[1:30:20] <%KeiganOfAstora> Thief's honor and all that *wink wink* @peachy996
[1:30:22] <%FacetiousAF> it did get do'd
[1:30:23] <%BoxNavy> you diiiiid it
[1:30:24] <%TheWinged7> time to use a bone

[1:30:35] <laserbeaming> implied wife/love interest
[1:30:36] <%barkon345> has she played Demon Souls yet?
[1:30:36] <+Heart0fInk> Tharlls make OneyNG sounds. Prove me wrong
[1:30:40] <+Mitchellsocks> She found the wife Sadge
[1:30:42] <Monkeyweed21> Wife or Mom
[1:30:43] <olaksi> first area cleared
[1:30:44] <@SoFarFetched> she hasn't played Demon Souls
[1:30:46] <primaryfire> only other thing is the darkwraith but she isnt doing that
[1:30:55] <%ClericOfSparda> sipsipSipsipblind
[1:30:56] <%KeiganOfAstora> Demon's Souls is next, 2022
[1:30:57] <@SoFarFetched> She didn't wanna play the Remake at the same time pat would be playing it.
[1:30:58] <$rdark_ksu> he's not a knife weilding piss gremlin
[1:31:03] <%BoxNavy> ...
[1:31:05] <$Sphincter_Spelunker> Elden Ring 2025
[1:31:08] <%BoxNavy> its making a noise
[1:31:09] <laserbeaming> didn't you need a different key for the Darkwraith?
[1:31:11] <MyNameIsRasus> DeS is gonna be rough
[1:31:13] <peachy996> Paige cannot think straight, only obtuse
[1:31:13] <%FacetiousAF> elden ring isn't real
[1:31:16] <promessav2> the darkwraith would be fun
[1:31:19] <+Jaysky> The hell is an elden ring?
[1:31:22] <$NitronStreams> 👏👏👏
[1:31:24] <%JJCheeker> She did
[1:31:26] <%blue8moon> that key I think comes from bloodbornman
[1:31:26] <+Dunmarkh> elden ring 2077
[1:31:27] <+Jaysky> One of those imaginative wedding rings?
[1:31:35] <Alephnoll> elden ring is an original story and series right?

[1:31:48] <+Jaysky> Yes @Alephnoll
[1:31:51] <$Sphincter_Spelunker> gotta pay the yoel toll
[1:31:56] <TheCoolestRyker> Elden Ring is a crossover with Tokyo Mirage Sessions
[1:31:59] <islandsunn> endurance!
[1:32:01] <+Dives__> Yoel Hole Yoel Hole a pirates life for me
[1:32:02] <$Sphincter_Spelunker> if you wanna get this dark soul
[1:32:03] <+Shockrates20XX> bearer seek seek lest

[1:32:06] <lloyddboy> confound your toll, yoel
[1:32:07] <laserbeaming> Endurance is good
[1:32:08] <Alephnoll> @Jaysky thats good maybe itll be a good place to start then.
[1:32:08] <AFlyingTaco1> @PeachSaliva Hey by the way, do you guys celebrate Thanksgiving?

[1:33:04] <StalwartZephyr> it was a bodybag, to be fair
[1:33:04] <olaksi> i feel like bringing a bone of the deceased isn't the way to break the news
[1:33:05] <%TheWinged7> Piage loves giving bone Kappa
[1:33:05] <maskedmook> she boned him
[1:33:15] <+GrooovinMagic> I recognize this bone!
[1:33:16] <megaman_sentinel> he's one of the few characters that feel human
[1:33:16] <$Sphincter_Spelunker> "I recognize her bones anywhere!"
[1:33:16] <Sain_127> hi peach and man peach
[1:33:19] <+Mitchellsocks> @KeiganOfAstora You get pips on death for each dark sigil, so you get more on each death for each level

[1:57:11] <+twohitgood> cornbread is wonderful on its own and elevates anything you use it in.
[1:57:11] <%TheWinged7> anything with vinegar in it is a bad dressing IMO
[1:57:12] <clockworkidiot> people use regular bread for dressing?
[1:57:12] <leinadtonu> what's the difference?
[1:57:15] <$Sphincter_Spelunker> oh, stuffing

[2:09:53] <%cdrom321> cdrom321 subscribed with Prime. They've subscribed for 2 months, currently on a 1 month streak! Thank you for getting back to Dark Souls 3. Do your meds last long enough for a full session, or is some of the effective time spent on reading starting donations? I hope they're lasting long enough for you to stay comfortable throughout your streams.
[2:09:58] <%CommanderSqueaks> She is learning!
[2:10:03] <@SoFarFetched> where souls drop in here is odd.

[2:13:00] <Shion963> then shoulda use Dex weapons
[2:13:05] <+Admiral_PopnFresh> Paige likes to look into your open eyes during'
[2:13:13] <%MrCalieb> always be a coward and always be a snitch
[2:13:17] <FancyFishies> *Sigh* one day she will learn about the drop down attack on rat
[2:13:24] <Jaxnos> i just got back into the stream on "i just wanna facefuck"
[2:13:32] <+twohitgood> it'd go up when eli talks.

[2:13:37] <alcors_wisdom> it would spike everytime you saw the baby
[2:13:42] <%juxtest> So we know when Peach dies
[2:13:44] <%KeiganOfAstora> I saw a Demon's Souls stream with heart BPM on screen today
[2:13:45] <$Sphincter_Spelunker> I think we would be concerned how low your BP is

[2:13:55] <+Invlux> "what it's ALWAYS at 140??"
[2:13:56] <Srthunda> we would see it rise and collectively think your time has come live on stream
[2:13:57] <%CommanderSqueaks> "BORK MOTHER, BORK"

[2:15:12] <%CommanderSqueaks> Peach is actually pretty darn good when she isn't panicking.
[2:15:15] <%cdrom321> @fraillightning Step 2: Put your junk in the box.
[2:15:15] <Shion963> Hmmmm hmmm, hmmmm AHAH
[2:15:16] <jellssssss20> Lol did Paige inhale food and give herself the hiccups? Possiblyy

[2:15:58] <lotharrio> There is a dog there.
[2:15:59] <%YakumoYomi> @CommanderSqueaks Indeed. If she could channel that energy that she used to wreck Ebrietas, she'd be really scary
[2:15:59] <%cdrom321> @fraillightning Step 3: Have her open the box.
[2:16:01] <Srthunda> I just make them fall off every time
[2:16:02] <Shion963> please stop running to the door
[2:16:03] <%CommanderSqueaks> Peach loves the sewer.
[2:16:06] <@SoFarFetched> You can also fuck with their walking animations and make them fall,but you have to do it right.
[2:16:08] <$rdark_ksu> tickle his nuts
[2:16:12] <zungeboi> they totally can
[2:16:15] <%juxtest> Engage him in honorable one on one combat

[2:41:49] <NireFuster> This is why Paige always looks away when talking to NPCs

[2:42:21] <promessav2> you can get attacked by things while talking
[2:42:25] <+twohitgood> it's not really a fromsoft issue, it's an issue with the controller design and buttons that trigger when you put it down.
[2:42:27] <+kvnmck94> the baby wants to make sure your ok. after that screm
[2:42:29] <%DemonOfSalt> @SoFarFetched I had no idea.
[2:42:32] <Slim_Lipid> Why would FromSoft be to blame for Sony's issues LUL

[2:46:31] <+pheblorganzardo> dont upgrade the deep axe lmao
[2:46:36] <+pheblorganzardo> it isnt very good
[2:46:44] <$rdark_ksu> right off the side

[2:46:48] <%KeiganOfAstora> @superc37 chill out dude
[2:46:48] <jellssssss20> Wha.. what was any sort of plan there lol
[2:46:49] <+Invlux> Breakfast is the meal of champions, but Paige doesn't eat breakfast
[2:46:58] <$Puhff> maybe don't estus when enemies are on top of you
[2:46:59] <CheekyBirb> if you can hear, you can see
[2:47:02] <$Sphincter_Spelunker> @MrCalieb 4th, she played Bloodborne first
[2:47:21] <IronGlorfindel> If you can dodge a rats you can dodge a bowl
[2:47:30] <%MrCalieb> ah yeah i remember
[2:47:39] <%cdrom321> @IronGlorfindel Good one.
[2:47:44] <%KeiganOfAstora> Go go groll
[2:47:48] <%KeiganOfAstora> so close
[2:47:57] <+AtlasMcCoy> Holy shit that throw
[2:47:59] <leinadtonu> These games are a test of patience and persistence more than anything else.
[2:48:08] <SulfurousAcid> at least they don't have more bowls
[2:48:09] <NireFuster> Peach just a tip for the future, don't INMEDIATELY roll around, you have to time it to when they attack and not roll randomly
[2:48:10] <%MrCalieb> i just mean that its dark souls 3
[2:48:11] <%superc37> @keiganofastora i didnt mean that against her, i was replying to the ppl who were all like "man i hate how plague keeps backseating her smh" when if neither of them were here she wouldnt have have gotten this far to begin with
[2:48:13] <+ghostfaceninja_> how are long time viewers getting upset over Paige's gameplay? like huh?
[2:48:17] <%KeiganOfAstora> Especially patience since you don't move very fast even with a run
[2:48:18] <%TheWinged7> b o w l
[2:48:22] <%KeiganOfAstora> Gotcha
[2:48:30] <%KeiganOfAstora> She might've, we don't know

[2:48:54] <+lethallylactic> lol
[2:48:54] <+pheblorganzardo> HMMMMMMMMMMMMMM
[2:48:55] <sosuke5> OH NO
[2:48:57] <%MrCalieb> this brings me so much joy
[2:49:00] <$Sphincter_Spelunker> I like how Sekiro gets meta at mindlessly throwing yourself at death, again and again
[2:49:02] <TurtlesAndTentacles> Yes

[2:49:11] <Dao_Puppy> Plague being so behind is like twice the fun.
[2:49:12] <SomeSageAdvice> its the ADHD
[2:49:14] <@SoFarFetched> She's not gonna quite rolling randomly now.
[2:49:14] <%maskofmichael> you started dating Pat
[2:49:15] <+Kindan55> pats fault
[2:49:19] <IronGlorfindel> Sun=Down
[2:49:21] <CheekyBirb> not eating contributed
[2:49:23] <%KeiganOfAstora> ADHD is rough sometimes
[2:49:23] <%MrCalieb> only eli knows how to traverse the BRAIN WEB
[2:49:28] <@SoFarFetched> quit*
[2:49:29] <NireFuster> Yeah I was here for the DS2 streams... but it doesn't hurt to repeat it I suppose!
[2:49:32] <AFlyingTaco1> So Plague isn't able to see her?
[2:49:35] <FerwhateverDota> there we go
[2:49:39] <JetpackMcQuack> not dumb >:(
[2:49:46] <%g0atmeal> PogChamp
[2:49:50] <%MrCalieb> sick hop
[2:49:52] <Jathspuh> @AFlyingTaco1 there's a delay
[2:49:57] <$rdark_ksu> probably has to do with your repeated high fevers slow cooking your head meat
[2:50:01] <+ghostfaceninja_> there's a delay for dial-up users
[2:50:06] <SomeSageAdvice> its not that Paige is dumb by any means, its just that ADHD is a real son of a bitch to deal with
[2:50:09] <@SoFarFetched> Yeah reminder Plague is on a Discord call with her and is watching the stream like we are.
[2:50:10] <%cdrom321> @AFlyingTaco1 Not without a 15-second delay.
[2:50:11] <%g0atmeal> I love how he sits
[2:50:15] <$Sphincter_Spelunker> the meat is swollen @rdark_ksu
[2:50:17] <jellssssss20> Plague sees what we’re seeing at the delay we’re seeing it iirc
[2:50:18] <vVAstrAVv> eli please just tell her theres a bonfire down the elevator and save her some runs
[2:50:20] <%superc37> @keiganofastora going by how her ability to memorize environments and in internalize information is mixed with her general piss poor memory with these games? i sincerely doubt that
[2:50:25] <+lethallylactic> LUL
[2:50:27] <therealtacopancakes> if she dies again does it fail the quest?
[2:50:28] <SulfurousAcid> honest
[2:50:30] <Jathspuh> LUL
[2:50:31] <%MrCalieb> head meat disrupts the brain web
[2:50:31] <%MaddyCaddy> Demons are scary, yo
[2:50:31] <leinadtonu> sounds risky
[2:50:32] <AFlyingTaco1> Ah, okay. I thought he just couldn't watch it but was able to listen.
[2:50:40] <@SoFarFetched> Plague's been reading chat.
[2:50:41] <+Milosolaire> That's a lot to ask of someone lol
[2:50:44] <+FackinCrazy> what if it was a sexy demon?
[2:50:45] <peachy996> Demons are scary unless they're hot
[2:50:48] <%superc37> again not to knock at her, but i mean.. i just find that doubtful
[2:50:49] <%MrCalieb> oh
[2:50:52] <jellssssss20> Did Sieg climb back up that roof after you died?
[2:50:54] <+lordericter> sometimes you just gotta throw hands with beelzebub
[2:50:55] <+InstiGaitan> god my ass cheeks
[2:50:55] <$Sphincter_Spelunker> Paige pls
[2:50:56] <CheekyBirb> lmao
[2:50:56] <IronGlorfindel> Pro tip: you can *almost* stealth this segment
[2:50:57] <$Puhff> OMG BISH
[2:50:58] <%TheWinged7> emotional or physical
[2:50:59] <NireFuster> My heartrate spiked up after that
[2:51:03] <TurtlesAndTentacles> PAIGE WHAT THE FUCK MAN
[2:51:08] <FerwhateverDota> man how did she survive
[2:51:09] <lotharrio> "Now Paige, consider what you'll do once you pick this fight with the demon. I don't think you have much of a plan, here."
[2:51:16] <%MrCalieb> give demon compliment, will resolve conflict
[2:51:20] <%cdrom321> @AFlyingTaco1 It's because it he lives in the house from "Courage the Cowardly Dog".
[2:51:24] <@SoFarFetched> yeah he can die to him.
[2:51:31] <%g0atmeal> SPONGEBOB, YOU SHOULD HAVE WAITED

[3:02:43] <Spudnacious_Dynasty> Consider large club
[3:02:44] <JetpackMcQuack> LUL
[3:02:48] <%KeiganOfAstora> It's his descendant shut up

[3:02:52] <lotharrio> No that's his great-granddad or something. It's fine.
[3:02:53] <%cdrom321> Is the large club still good here?
[3:02:54] <SoySocks> does plague have a favorite Bloodborne npc?
[3:02:56] <%CommanderSqueaks> -The heaviest sigh-
[3:02:57] <+Jaysky> I find it really weird that they brought the exact same voice back
[3:03:00] <EuropanLamprey> He actually succeeds in his quest here tho
[3:03:02] <$Puhff> eli stop

[3:03:31] <jumpyhugs> Did you know Sieglind is a hot blond? I clipped my camera through her helmet
[3:03:32] <+gambit_gamble> !lurk
[3:03:32] <promessav2> i think it's interesting, and his armor is a lot more worn than siegfried
[3:03:32] <Jolly_Adventurer> does paige have a bow?
[3:03:35] <sosuke5> use your brain legs
[3:03:35] <biglomix> Why do I imagine plauge in a sweater right now
[3:03:36] <%juxtest> I forget what happens to Squidward after he falls down the well
[3:03:40] <%g0atmeal> Wow I never knew you could go there

[3:03:53] <%blue8moon> oh my god I didn't realize you could get up there, I always just shot it
[3:03:55] <$Sphincter_Spelunker> Sieglind plays deathless runs in Dark Souls
[3:04:03] <%MrCalieb> i always shoot it too

[3:24:36] <$rdark_ksu> Paige I thought you ate the bees in peanut butter with Scrooge mcduck
[3:24:36] <viciousgrim> sexy times
[3:24:38] <+demon1103> Spike mace!!! and she got it easily...thats fine, im not mad that I had to farm one for like a half hour the other night
[3:24:38] <+lordericter> should have spun your revolvers to deflect the bees
[3:24:41] <+ghostfaceninja_> those people are assholes
[3:24:44] <%Pandora_Prime> Flynn Lives
[3:24:45] <%Sotetsu> Was the pie okay?
[3:24:46] <theOG_RB> "They had hornets that attacked me. They were alright"
[3:24:47] <%MrCalieb> i like to think she's not retelling this story but that it happened AGAIN
[3:24:48] <+treemanfour> I once hit a hornet next with a weedwacker by accident, i have never run faster in my life
[3:24:49] <huskarl_zap> Woolie stole the pie and replaced it with hornets
[3:24:51] <AFlyingTaco1> That's kinda funny but that's also kinda fucked up that they just laughed at you
[3:24:51] <$Sphincter_Spelunker> @Sotetsu LUL
[3:24:52] <+KikioJane> That's fucking awful
[3:24:57] <NireFuster> Imagine seeing a lady rolling in the ground covered by hornets screaming in agony and her neighbors just laughing lol
[3:24:58] <+redstonej> hornets are just friends you haven't met yet
[3:24:59] <%aslfrasle> @rdark_ksu That's a separate story which had bees in her sandwich.
[3:25:01] <+jiggy_snipe> I would watch a Paige sitcom. Her life sounds odd
[3:25:02] <SwindlerOfProgress> @lordericter God, that part is so fucking dumb LUL
[3:25:02] <NireFuster> That's kinda awful
[3:25:04] <%g0atmeal> Equip BTSR
[3:25:05] <Zaphire_Saucypants> you didn't roll around while HOLDING the pie, did you?
[3:25:09] <jonnyworldbeater> And then she fell down the stairs and her shoes fell off
[3:25:10] <@SoFarFetched> she should actually equip that blood ring
[3:25:13] <leinadtonu> Well, imagine PAIGE rolling down a hill yelling "BEEESSS"
[3:25:14] <%MrCalieb> maybe the hornets were dressed as clowns
[3:25:14] <@SoFarFetched> that would have helped her
[3:25:20] <+ghostfaceninja_> "I'm just pop a quick H on this box..."
[3:25:26] <$rdark_ksu> @aslfrasle oh I know I just find it hilarious
[3:25:28] <%g0atmeal> Not the clutch ring tho
[3:25:31] <EuropanLamprey> Flynn Ring will do nothing for her with that armor
[3:25:32] <uncledoodsauce> woolie stealing pies is a rumor until proven true
[3:25:46] <logoth_> Ouch this ring weighs and an entire pound
[3:25:57] <%MrCalieb> so we know theres hornets in it
[3:25:57] <AFlyingTaco1> But it's just as true as that guy he killed that one time
[3:26:00] <Essixian> @logoth_ It's not pounds, it's Miyazakis
[3:26:02] <snarfoogle> the bigger the bling, the heavier the ring
[3:26:09] <+Ankation> everywhere but
[3:26:10] <IronGlorfindel> Flynn's Ring does literally nothing if you're wearing armor
[3:26:15] <SpaceGuntank> blue tearstone would be great for paige seeing as she gets hit quite often.
[3:26:17] <NocturneNovember> did we beat Casual Balrog?
[3:26:17] <huskarl_zap> woolie killed that pie and stole that guy
[3:26:28] <+jiggy_snipe> Woolie recently told the story of that guy he killed.
[3:26:31] <$Sphincter_Spelunker> her armor weighs 20 whole Miyazakis

[3:27:24] <+tigerfang86> she could use an ember
[3:27:28] <+tigerfang86> get that extra health

[3:36:33] <Essixian> So far in terms of NPCs we've got Wife, Buzzkill, Hey Guys Remember Dark Souls 2?, Simpin' For Dead Gals, Hammerbang The Bearded and Little Timmy No-Legs.
[3:36:33] <@SoFarFetched> Yeah she hasn't talked to a lot of people.

[3:37:07] <Shion963> Mortician's Asses
[3:37:08] <Essixian> So Plague, why is this Dark Souls 2 woman here?

[3:37:24] <+tigerfang86> does it REALLY matter
[3:37:33] <%g0atmeal> @Essixian something something convoluted
[3:37:34] <CheekyBirb> i mean Dark Souls 3 is a mish mash for the sake of it
