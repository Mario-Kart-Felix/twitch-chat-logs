[0:52:03] <%JoshManVGH> Oh yeah reticalless aiming!
[0:52:03] <%G_Thunders> @keyd00d that was the main gimmick in the first one, yeah

[0:52:05] <Raikouija> ohhhhh shit its a real JOTUN
[0:52:06] <Hawkbone_> Where gameplay

[0:52:08] <%tizz86> fiya
[0:52:09] <+cvp5127> hes fine
[0:52:09] <+Dunder_Mifflinz> It's gameplay without the QTE prompts
[0:52:09] <dan_g_v> seems we made an oopsie
[0:52:10] <%Sotetsu> Stop, drop, and roll.
[0:52:10] <%samTUMZfestival> Imagine taking a nap and then suddenly-
[0:52:10] <%BallerSwagBro9k> Burning Man
[0:52:12] <Tampaoster> @legendfather_of_giants THE OL DICKTWIST
[0:52:12] <%Keyd00d> Oh I see

[0:52:17] <odnucaf3> he was just sleeping
[0:52:17] <MicrotonalMatt> That’s not really how fire works
[0:52:18] <krewl123> this prono is getting weird man
[0:52:19] <KineticZen> The internal monologue is supposed to be split personality type stuff
[0:52:19] <assfordayz> wow they suck at it
[0:52:21] <theOakThorn> "gameplay"
[0:52:22] <Zombrocom> We call this "In-engine footage"
[0:52:22] <%hewlettfan96> Uuuuuh
[0:52:23] <%Leonnald> This doesn't look like gameplay at all, it looks like a cutscene, so who cares.
[0:52:23] <TurtlesAndTentacles> I feel bad for the Giant dude
[0:52:23] <SinnerEbru> do you need a water train, guy
[0:52:24] <%sleepers1mulant> monkaS

[0:52:28] <+Jrocy247> """"GAMEPLAY""""
[0:52:31] <%Sotetsu> The fire went out.
[0:52:32] <%spitelite> cinematic "gameplay" is dumb and i don't understand why people want it
[0:52:34] <%chiazam> This definitely isn’t as big as Elden Ring
[0:52:37] <jen895> this happened to my buddy eric
[0:52:37] <heartlesshealer> cool, great, picked a fight and got burned alive by their own tools
[0:52:37] <+TheNommad> did this bitch forget that Jotun are magic?

[0:52:48] <Dementedpenguin> Escort Mission PogChamp
[0:52:50] <RickyRelucent> FACE ME *run*
[0:52:50] <+Noir_Valdr> "gameplay." Hm.
[0:52:50] <+Scheaugne> giant fire baby man
[0:52:50] <Yuroshi> did they just burn the giant alive because he is a different race?
[0:52:50] <+yoshkosh20> the atmoshpere building though. holy shit.
[0:52:54] <tacoisgoods> "Gameplay"
[0:52:55] <ralphfromdk> So far it's basicly a walking sim...
[0:52:56] <T_Sasquatch> Cinematic experience
[0:52:57] <rhalmarius93> THOSE TWO DIED FOR NOTHING
[0:52:57] <Valdorick> This is really stupid when you realize she's just screaming at a cave wall and is just some homeless women.
[0:52:57] <+Birdigalore> Some engaging "gameplay" here
[0:52:59] <Louie_Salmon> That fake ass quick-turn
[0:52:59] <+Walopoh> very stylized but this trailer kinda... sucks
[0:52:59] <%BinaryFireball> this.mmm why did they make a sequel ...
[0:53:00] <ZorenMaximus> Where Kratos?
[0:53:00] <odnucaf3> where is Nioh 3?
[0:53:01] <+captain_thickthighs> are we still doing these video game movie things I thought we covered this like years ago no one cares we want gameplay
[0:53:01] <SulfurousAcid> I'm sure there was a button press to throw the spear
[0:53:02] <%Ranryu692> that thing is too tall to be Pat, guys
[0:53:02] <krewl123> were does the gameplay begin and the movie end?
[0:53:03] <Shacklebox> those guys are badasses
[0:53:04] <SassOverlord> getting seconds at a time of gameplay lmao
[0:53:05] <Justlaxy> Is this one gonna have VR like the last one?
[0:53:06] <%barkon345> I wonder if Heilung is doing the entire soundtrack
[0:53:06] <Drunkengen> VERY REAL GAMEPLAY
[0:53:06] <+Masked_Hero_Lucky> Lol, that spear magnetized to her hand
[0:53:07] <EMP_Ike_Turner> Gief hates it
[0:53:07] <fanciful_fright> I thought the monsters and stuff were metaphorical in the first game?
[0:53:07] <%Sotetsu> So is this gameplay?
[0:53:07] <+Shishi1205> That lance disappeared
[0:53:08] <AmericanaRed> FART NA NOOOO shibuy4Aqua
[0:53:09] <+mustachegolem> why are they not throwing more oil?
[0:53:10] <+NecDW4> actual gamep[lay LUL
[0:53:11] <$ChubbyPencil> This is either a deam or WOW did they just miss the point of their own game
[0:53:12] <%samTUMZfestival> RUN AWAY
[0:53:12] <Tampaoster> it reminds me of asura's wrath movieplay style of gameplay
[0:53:12] <SinnerEbru> i hope those are actual aim gameplay moments
[0:53:13] <Hawkbone_> Where are the video games
[0:53:17] <+Havictos> Are any of these people even there?
[0:53:17] <TurtlesAndTentacles> so you're picking on the giant cause he's a giant?
[0:53:19] <+admiral_of_crunch> Look at that in-depth gameplay. Hold that analog stick forward
[0:53:21] <%BinaryFireball> senua's gameplay was never great to be fair
[0:53:23] <TheotherKristian> IS THIS PLAGUE TALE 3!?!?
[0:53:23] <sothatsprettybrutal> here's one thing there is SO MUCH of this footage this is long as hell damn
[0:53:23] <+ProfessorMorrigan> stop bullying the jotunn peepoSad
[0:53:26] <T_Sasquatch> Yknow what's fucking cinematic ? Almost every second of ghost of tsushima
[0:53:26] <studleydoorite> what they need is an even bigger mannequin guy
[0:53:27] <ComfyFox> She has Mass Effect Eyes
[0:53:27] <Raikouija> yeah lets fight the same creatures that SPAWNED LOKI

[0:53:52] <anoddish1> This feels like it's going on for a while.
[0:53:52] <%g0atmeal> chat loves to be cynical lol
[0:53:53] <Allenou> G.A.M.E.P.L.A.Y.
[0:53:53] <Ipsenscastle> this seems like a dull part to showcase
[0:53:54] <%legendfather_of_giants> @cadence_the_sad it's not because its a cinematic game its because its Ninja Theory
[0:53:55] <%samTUMZfestival> THE GIANT should have his own game.
[0:53:59] <TurtlesAndTentacles> I don't like screaming Laura Bailey
[0:53:59] <heartlesshealer> man, why did they even try to fight it? What possible story could lead to this?
[0:54:00] <evbites> chat is pissing it's diaper
[0:54:02] <$scallycap> she screm
[0:54:02] <+Chimeraelite> don't worry about it people. The first game had plenty of stuff and challenge. Enjoy the show now and then
[0:54:03] <+admiral_of_crunch> Lots more production on this one, I can see why they want to show it off.
[0:54:03] <+QuandtumTheory> "attack" "girl thats what weve been doing"
[0:54:04] <+spleekle> @cadence_the_sad sadly, chat is always toxic during these things
[0:54:04] <AngryAsian5> What is their plan exactly?
[0:54:05] <+LadySaga_> lmao
[0:54:05] <Macguffn> Should I feel guilty that I don't care at all?
[0:54:06] <AMDBR9S> they did say this was gameplay?
[0:54:07] <%Sotetsu> This is so long.
[0:54:08] <+carfar_farcar> chat salty
[0:54:08] <%dankjerri> if i wanted to watch a story, id open a streaming service
[0:54:08] <+captain_thickthighs> I'm looking at my watch here
[0:54:09] <Valdorick> Nothing this is real, aint none of this is really happening.
[0:54:10] <+Birdigalore> Great plan, folks!
[0:54:11] <%Leonnald> This looks bad
[0:54:11] <kick13_> ninja theory with the shitty games again
[0:54:11] <SinnerEbru> its a big action sequence tho, its ATTENTION
[0:54:11] <%chiazam> Why don’t you attack too
[0:54:11] <$SvenHolgersson> This already feels way too long
[0:54:11] <+DrTomT18> @g0atmeal I mean this looks nice, but it looks like I'm watching a movie, not a video game.
[0:54:11] <+rockywm> this kinda long
[0:54:12] <mandatoryviolence> That thing just will not die
[0:54:12] <Zombrocom> This is what the first game was like I guess
[0:54:12] <TheZearGuy> Seems poorly planned
[0:54:12] <%sleepers1mulant> :/
[0:54:13] <Hawkbone_> Show actual gameplay
[0:54:14] <+InternetShis> cromch
[0:54:15] <+JaseAdrift> Just look at this gameplay
[0:54:15] <nuane> tbh they started it
[0:54:15] <+bugz_munny> So whens this airin on Netflix?
[0:54:15] <missingangle> @g0atmeal This happens every Game awards, tbh.
[0:54:19] <T_Sasquatch> @g0atmeal dude this is basically a cgi trailer. Like come on
[0:54:19] <Justlaxy> it's not real
[0:54:21] <sothatsprettybrutal> confront the pain of failing to kill that dude
[0:54:22] <+orochiblood> How is chat being toxic, this trailer kinda sucks. I liked Hellblade 1 btw.
[0:54:24] <%RealThiele> QTEs are gameplay right ? LUL

[0:54:28] <%MechArch> aot?
[0:54:28] <+Walopoh> bad trailer
[0:54:29] <Louie_Salmon> If you can summarize a trailer in one sentence you probably shouldn't have it last multiple minutes
[0:54:30] <stevenellis386> damn son
[0:54:30] <luciluxlu0> this is like negative context
[0:54:31] <%saltyblackyouth> Man. It's not a good time to like things. It's so much easier to just not like things.
[0:54:31] <+Roundhowl> This looks mid
[0:54:31] <HeyBoston> oh no the bad giant guy is actually good
[0:54:31] <worldbrand> what an odd trailer
[0:54:32] <Dr_Mooose> hmm
[0:54:34] <%Ranryu692> that was terrible

[1:00:11] <darkelfdebauchery> THAT FOUNDATION IS CAKED ON. YOU COULD BUILD A HOUSE ON THAT CHIN
[1:00:11] <jbrachob> It IS, I bet you it is
[1:00:11] <+michingmallecho> Star Wars David cage LUL
[1:00:11] <%RealThiele> uff FB

[1:00:17] <%chiazam> Ads
[1:00:17] <assfordayz> Its super on purpose
[1:00:17] <%AHomeschoolDropout> Every company that does it probably has a ton of rapists inside

[1:00:17] <chambatron> EVIL COMPANY NINTENDO
[1:00:18] <+coward_man> it's super on purpose
[1:00:19] <+boxboten> its very cynical at least
[1:00:19] <SubjectX07x> It's not on purpose, it's still very cringey "look at our representation" though.
[1:00:20] <Xhog1> Guys did you know that Nintendo Switch has games?
[1:00:20] <stevenellis386> really wanted to try eastward.
[1:00:21] <heartlesshealer> It like is
[1:00:21] <missingangle> It's not intentional, but it's still icky.
[1:00:22] <maubpp> it's pretty sus ngl
[1:00:23] <a_wandering_scarecrow> Whether it was intentional or not, it feels pretty fucking bad.
[1:00:23] <+AkronymCLT> i mean all the companies are evil
[1:00:23] <+Masked_Hero_Lucky> It's the game industry, it's totally on purpose

[1:00:29] <TheotherKristian> Oh it is
[1:00:29] <Zombrocom> When every single video game company is owned by monsters it's kind of inevitable
[1:00:29] <MrNoobMcSalt> It's WAY too convenient
[1:00:30] <bloodbornechad> Ender Lilies is great
[1:00:31] <uncle_grumps> All corporations are evil.

[1:30:55] <%legendfather_of_giants> @Ravioli_Ronin not anymore
[1:30:56] <%greasypete00> its destinky
[1:30:56] <ohno778> PLAY WARFRAME
[1:30:57] <cpt_langosta> lol who even plays destiny anymore
[1:30:58] <@A_German_spy> @PlagueOfGripes I see you're here too. Hey man
[1:31:01] <scizor285> new 30th anniversary event was good
[1:31:03] <user_naim> are they going to sell us mars 2
[1:31:03] <AmericanaRed> ANTHEM 2
[1:31:04] <+ScottishMadJacko> look at this temporary content
[1:31:04] <FunkyWaters> This looks cool ... oh wait, it's Destiny
[1:31:05] <roz_en> Was that not just the Halo CE pistol?
[1:31:06] <+captain_thickthighs> if it's popular enough Pat will have to play it
[1:31:06] <%hewlettfan96> Damn wooooow
[1:31:06] <T_Sasquatch> @ohno778 NO
[1:31:07] <@A_German_spy> @g0atmeal I admire your optimism karacoLOL
[1:31:07] <Valdorick> By the time this content released, EVERY SINGLE GUN IN THE TRAILER WILL HAVE BEEN SUNLIT
[1:31:09] <+bugz_munny> Same 3 enemies
[1:31:09] <aflowerybard> what i miss
[1:31:11] <butthurtdave> Did they ever fix it or did they doubledown and make it worse
[1:31:11] <CaptainPileDriver> destiny wishes it was good.
[1:31:11] <Hoodywolf> they added some halo guns recently that people talked about. But outside of that I havent heard much about it lol
[1:31:12] <+SorakuFett> Bungie 30th Anniversary, they put the Magnum and BR, as well as a sword with half an energy sword and a lever-action shotgun with a DMR barrel.
[1:31:14] <Gnapalm> Call it Destiny 3 and maybe ill care
[1:31:15] <+Logoth_> Destiny 2 is impossible to get into as a new player
[1:31:15] <+Dunder_Mifflinz> I WANT to love Destiny 2 so much, but the content and way they approach vaulting stuff just kills it for me
[1:31:16] <%gnarly_memes_bro> @g0atmeal don't give me hope man
[1:31:17] <Ghufufin> the blandest of enemies
[1:31:17] <+Birdigalore> Netflix Bebop got cancelled? lol
[1:31:19] <$GarbageNirvana> Let's look at Zangief
[1:31:20] <+NickyDynamite> Destiny is a game I love dearly and play a lot and still tell my friends probably dont play it
[1:31:21] <digaogrunge> Make Destiny 3 an FMV game
[1:31:22] <%BoxNavy> yes
[1:31:23] <+D00msDayDan> @captain_thickthighs pat did play it, then luke smith made sure he'd never touch it again
[1:31:23] <%bassoontyphoon> Destiny 2, more like Destiny Poo
[1:31:24] <%hewlettfan96> Destiny is too inconsistent to judge properly
[1:31:24] <Lodestarrobot> yes paige
[1:31:24] <%aishman> I absolutely hate how Destiny tells its story. It legit makes me feel like I have no idea waht the fuck is going on and thus I don't have fun
[1:31:25] <+Kevlar_Caviar> yes
[1:31:26] <Shwepie> @PeachSaliva Pat, did your opinion on Destiny 2 change more than your opinion on Warframe?
[1:31:27] <Tracazoid> Destiny 1, the game that was supposed to last a decade or more LUL
[1:31:29] <%chiazam> YOU CANT EVEN PLAY THE FIRST PART OF DESTINY 2
[1:31:30] <catfoot13> Won't we all look foolish when it turns out to be Destiny 5
[1:31:31] <%chiazam> Why
[1:31:31] <+Chewygamer> TOO ANGRY TO DIE
[1:31:33] <ralphfromdk> Destiny is the one where the ORB gives people powers.
[1:31:34] <willyfreshness> Good time to play Halo Infinite
[1:31:34] <%sleepers1mulant> DESTINY 2: THE BITCH QUEEN
[1:31:36] <cpt_langosta> LUL
[1:31:38] <%GetGianni> LUL
[1:31:39] <Skatedeandre> Oooh the enemy is just like you
[1:31:40] <+RandyFistburgers> lul
[1:31:40] <Hawkbone_> LUL
[1:31:40] <dinnydanny777> Na
[1:31:41] <%greasypete00> what is that helmet
[1:31:43] <RickyRelucent> they sold halo for this
[1:31:46] <+razielhex> Destiny 2 should have just been an expansion to Destiny 1, rather than a new game that effectively killed the first
[1:31:46] <rhalmarius93> GIANNI
[1:31:47] <PirateMike_> +1
[1:31:47] <$Sphincter_Spelunker> NaCl
[1:31:51] <+griffball13> LIGHT BACK
[1:31:51] <mr_saturday93> destiny 2 flip-flops depending on who you ask
[1:31:55] <+goose_attack_almanac> No this is video games
[1:31:57] <+Ne1son> Man this is really long
[1:31:57] <T_Sasquatch> Man this trailer is still going
[1:31:57] <+Noir_Valdr> no matter how much they try to show this game's "coolness", they removed the game that I paid for.
[1:31:58] <tanarath> Destiny is the one where Bungie tried to make Warframe and then fucked it up after making something good.
[1:31:59] <+banjostevens> This is long
[1:32:02] <Buttku> is destiny contractually obligated to never add new enemies?
[1:32:03] <+Massimoman64> Dang these trailers are looooooonnng
[1:32:03] <+TunakIn> dedstwnai
[1:32:03] <theOakThorn> If they are going to take content away they should rebrand it back to just "Destiny" and not Destiny 2
[1:32:03] <%AncelDeLambert> I haven't been paying attention, what the FUCK am I looking at?
[1:32:04] <Pede2011> WAY TOO LONG
[1:32:05] <+Genericho> next bit
[1:32:06] <benjakirb> does anybody care about this?
[1:32:06] <+DrTomT18> It's weird to imagine Gaurdians just like... hanging out and not doing action shit
[1:32:06] <unboundsky> I can’t wait for content to be deleted for this
[1:32:08] <%Catpurnicus> every trailer is 3x too long
[1:32:08] <cpt_langosta> that "thing" was a gun that'll get vaulted a few months after you earn it
[1:32:10] <Aeroallways> can't wait to pay for whatever this is and it being taken away in 2 years
[1:32:11] <oda_flobunaga> It just looks like a visual mess
[1:32:12] <AmericanaRed> THE BICH QUEEN
[1:32:13] <$GarbageNirvana> Turn off the dark
[1:32:14] <worldbrand> this is retroactively making me disinterested in destiny
[1:32:14] <%AncelDeLambert> WHAT
[1:32:14] <+oktavia_von> waifu
[1:32:15] <MidnightPacif1c> ResidentSleeper

[1:32:36] <%AHomeschoolDropout> What do you mean by "first mission"
[1:32:37] <%optimasmaximas> THATS NOT TRUE
[1:32:38] <+Vex_Machina> Very Cool....
[1:32:38] <+RayDaug> When do you get the content that you paid for but they took out of the game back?
[1:32:38] <Hoodywolf> hopefully that wasnt one of the big announcements lol

[1:32:45] <luciluxlu0> to bad good expansions exist
[1:32:45] <amiavamp> The Witch King? No, no, please don't sue us
[1:32:45] <MrNoobMcSalt> At this point Bungie should just turn into a Trailer house

[2:31:25] <+kyh9> UNAVOIDABLE CRINGE
[2:31:25] <butthurtdave> MCU Quip machine
[2:31:25] <DusK_The_Stray> The gameplay itself is really fun, but man, listening to it is pretty bad
[2:31:26] <+scottysunday> The medieval times adventure we all wanted
[2:31:26] <nuane> I dont know how dialogue can ruin a game but it did
[2:31:27] <$ChubbyPencil> The gameplay is fantastic but jesus christ just mute the entire game
[2:31:27] <%gnarly_memes_bro> @peachsaliva game will probably be fine but the dialog will be horrible

[2:31:32] <%optimasmaximas> the dlcs for 3 were a LOT better with that than the main game

[2:31:41] <ZorenMaximus> They don't shut the fuck up
[2:31:41] <Aleate> Its like someone reading a bad joke book for hours on end
[2:31:41] <%RayReborne> The VILLAINS are cringe. the player character chime in lines are decently funny

[2:31:53] <%JoshManVGH> They tried to emulate Anthony Burch and they totally failed.

[3:18:47] <NawsCire> what does game direction mean?
[3:18:47] <blackjack8182> RIGGED
[3:18:48] <etnoika> Has It Takes Two won anything???
[3:18:49] <+Noir_Valdr> uuuugh
[3:18:50] <Aleate> Psychonauts wins nothing tfuHypers
[3:18:51] <%OfficioPrefectusCorgi> Snpud
[3:18:53] <+Bullet_harrier> who care
[3:18:54] <+McSoliace> normies
[3:18:55] <+JGardner03> Is Deathloop the Last of Us this year, was that last year..
[3:18:55] <MidnightPacif1c> IMMERSIVE SIM
[3:18:56] <Dapper_Cactuar> both Ratchet and Psychonauts 2 won nothing
[3:18:57] <%generalve> Josef Favres got screwed hard
[3:19:00] <Billli11> it take two won 1
[3:19:01] <stevenellis386> Psychonauts didn't win a thing, did it
[3:19:02] <+fredan31> it's a weak year for games
[3:19:02] <%optimasmaximas> WHICH IS WHY JAPAN GAMES GET FUCKED
[3:19:05] <%sleepers1mulant> PSYCHONAUTS GOT SHAFTED
[3:19:06] <+scottysunday> Psychonauts 2 consistently being screwed over
[3:19:06] <+William_Patton> I like deathloop but thats still bs
[3:19:07] <dinnydanny777> But Dread won something
[3:19:09] <%chiazam> It was directed pretty well
[3:19:09] <Hawkbone_> Isn't Ratchet more "normie" than Deathloop though?
[3:19:09] <+kknutson4> Didn't Pat really like Deathloop
[3:19:10] <+flexin_apex> Hope they win goty at least
[3:19:10] <+Whiskey_T_Foxtrot> Like the academy awards but worse
[3:19:11] <%baka_sugoi> true
[3:19:11] <+nivlac_555> it's almost like all award show
[3:19:12] <MrMatternot> Loop Hero?
[3:19:12] <CaptainPileDriver> it's why guilty gear didn't get a fucking music nomination
[3:19:12] <+CyprienCole> they mixed it with worst game
[3:19:15] <%polothegreatest> cuz its a kids game /s LUL
[3:19:16] <Mattais88> Remember when 13 sentinels got nothing
[3:19:18] <gameshark45> So just severely handicapped then
[3:19:19] <whitebatsy> Also several of those Sites are under teh sam eumbrella corp
[3:19:20] <Raikouija> Metroid Dread is still nominated for Game of the year BTW
[3:19:20] <+TunakIn> man psychonauts being snubbed feels real bad
[3:19:23] <+goose_attack_almanac> FIVE ELDEN RING SIZED ANNOUNCEMENTS
[3:19:23] <OneThousandTomatoes> the snake is getting ready to eat everyone in <20 minutes

[3:19:44] <susukouhai> Wow they really hate Ratchet
[3:19:44] <tanarath> It's 50/50,which is better than the past, but par for the course right now.
[3:19:46] <+darudeampersandstorm> every single other Arkane game was more deserving
[3:19:46] <+blastyoboots> Two Japanese games won in the last half hour
[3:19:48] <%GetGianni> the judges saw the most ads for Deathloop so that's what they think the best game is
[3:19:48] <%doomunderthestairs> yasssssss
[3:19:49] <dukenux> tenk u
[3:19:50] <Explodincatz> I will never review the Japanese
[3:19:53] <+HiroTSK5> Neo Twewy was super Robbed this year

[3:34:18] <Gutsandlove> EDF
[3:34:19] <%le_master_of_le_swords> It’s ridiculous you have to do this
[3:34:19] <%JoshManVGH> The crap is Nexon?

[3:34:34] <DavidSanChan> pat's greasy piss lip filler
[3:34:36] <lemon_rinds> Did I miss anything remotely interesting over the last hour?
[3:34:36] <ZorenMaximus> Never heard of Nexon
[3:34:37] <MidnightPacif1c> EDF
[3:34:38] <Maids4lyfe> don't you just have a mute button instead of using volume slider?
[3:34:38] <+Dunder_Mifflinz> Why does this look alright though
[3:34:39] <%eveningrivers> Earth Defense Force?
[3:34:40] <HatingSince87> Earth Defense Force?
[3:34:40] <+WutangchickeN> every time that you have to mute it you should talk about how tiny Jeff's penis is
[3:34:40] <+Havictos> Why even bother with sound
[3:34:43] <%gnarly_memes_bro> @joshmanvgh purveyors of Maplestory and other trash mmos
[3:34:43] <+Bananamanstan> So if It takes two win think that will be brought up in court?
[3:34:45] <Zourath> Nexon managed to kill the most profitable MMO in the world, in the US.
[3:34:46] <+realm_forge> Giant enemy crab
[3:34:47] <OvaltineDream> atari

[3:34:51] <Caivyre> TO SAVE THE MOTHER EARTH FROM ANY ALIEN ATTACK
[3:34:52] <penitentpendant> ...Atari?

[3:34:53] <$SvenHolgersson> For the cringe factor
[3:34:54] <%doomunderthestairs> yassssssssssssss
[3:34:54] <VritraReiRei> @PeachSaliva i honestly suggest for future stuff like this, just mute the whole thing. people can put the video in the background while watching and you dont have to worry about music then
[3:34:55] <%legendfather_of_giants> YES DO
[3:34:56] <%Ranryu692> please do
[3:34:56] <%DMitSteve> oh look its the atari game
[3:34:56] <+Taisuru> I thought they updated their policy on DMCA shit during restreams?
[3:34:56] <cherrycottontail> yeah nexon is where you go when literally no one else will take you
[3:34:57] <Marakami_Sadaneo> remember when you started streams muted though
[3:34:57] <NewWillinium> The game works pretty at least, but that's not saying much these days unless it does something unique to the art style
[3:34:58] <missingangle> Oh that'd be fun!
[3:34:58] <+Will9099> do it
[3:34:59] <+Walopoh> Yes!
[3:35:00] <%TimetodiveLTX> the run speed seems really tuned

[3:35:04] <+razielhex> ED-209

[3:35:10] <Monkeyweed21> you could always ask Suzi or Butterbuns how they went this whole event without muting much and its fine for them

[3:41:33] <Finakala> Ratchet was rad honestly
[3:41:33] <octotasty> Mute for Guardians? I don't remember if it's nominated
[3:41:33] <CaptainPileDriver> it takes two is a really good game that has some fucked up scenes

[3:42:06] <Skatedeandre> i wish i was too actually
[3:42:06] <+Bananamanstan> FORMERLY NAMED GAME!
[3:42:07] <pokefan9956> calling it. it's gonna be psychonauts
[3:42:08] <CaptainPileDriver> psychonauts 2 literally would've never existed if the studio didn't get bought
[3:42:08] <belliqua> how rude that they play psychonauts and won't give them a fucking award
[3:42:11] <+Mekhet09> @TheHeroAppears Pat will never play psychonauts.
[3:42:12] <+rheviel> Zangief just appreciates food
[3:42:12] <+darudeampersandstorm> Psychonauts 2 is 100% the best out of all the games nominated
[3:42:14] <+razielhex> thiose drummers in center-left rear are going to town
[3:42:14] <blackjack8182> Anything other than Deathloop
[3:42:14] <%generalve> since like 2016
[3:42:15] <Hydrapissed> get drunk for elden ring pat
[3:42:16] <%GabeSweetMan> We all have our favorite, but EVERYONE here is united in ANTI-DEATHLOOP.
[3:42:17] <%doomunderthestairs> it would be real nice if It Take Two took it
[3:42:18] <mr_saturday93> has Paige ever been drunk on stream?
[3:42:19] <%polothegreatest> Psychooooo2
[3:42:21] <%cooldude69xx> @Prism_Zet Actually it was Paige! Fun fact
[3:42:22] <%AncelDeLambert> Psychonauts 2 is good, but it's not better than Metroid
[3:42:27] <+spleekle> YEYEYE VIII
[3:42:27] <+Walopoh> my pick RE
[3:42:33] <%generalve> Did you guys ever get drunk watching the TNG strams ?

[3:42:46] <+Jrocy247> RE OR METROID
[3:42:47] <%greasypete00> deathloop is on the list
[3:42:49] <%bassoontyphoon> none of these tracks are recognisable at all
[3:42:50] <+darudeampersandstorm> @AncelDeLambert imo it is, but that's because Metroid wasn't even the best Metroid to come out this year
[3:42:51] <%GabeSweetMan> @tanarath It doesn't matter. We're probably fucked.
[3:42:51] <catfoot13> Ratchet or RE8
[3:42:56] <%polothegreatest> granted metroid is good sofarfPog

[3:43:06] <+ShazBo2000> Village soundtrack  was great
[3:43:06] <crisscross0_> Yeah, Ratchet or Dread would be fine
[3:43:06] <+TheHateFish> Actually decent list this year, for a change
[3:43:08] <%polothegreatest> sipsipGasm

[3:58:42] <Valdorick> If two are better than one, then it makes sense. After all, if guys think with only one head, then of course activating both at the same time would improve their mental state!

[3:58:45] <%GabeSweetMan> I like Paige's version.

[3:59:06] <allanmiri> @Futurecity10 The what?
[3:59:09] <cpt_langosta> protip for anyone starting gen1 pokemon: name yourself "I peed" and your rival "I farted" so that oak, at one point, says "I peed and I farted." You're welcome.
[3:59:09] <@Jekado> It's either Taint or it AINT
[3:59:12] <Valdorick> taint what it use to be.
[3:59:13] <%GabeSweetMan> Good ol' NarutoX.
[3:59:20] <+BoboDaHobo> the Viagra thing is probably just a measure of "people with Alzheimer's don't get pussy" meaning they don't end up using Viagra
[3:59:22] <Futurecity10> @allanmiri The korean mmo with all the children?
[3:59:22] <+SenorCounter> They'll know

[3:59:49] <%Ranryu692> @PeachSaliva apparently Sonic Frontiers is being written by the author of the Sonic comics
[3:59:52] <@SoFarFetched> Just people unfortuantely looked at the trailer weirdly. But it didn't help they put the adult figuration of dancing onto kids so it looked odd.
[3:59:52] <+cvp5127> hes disney material
[3:59:53] <%GabeSweetMan> Ah so that's where my sub message went. lol
[3:59:58] <twistedj3ster> "All Jedi in my game are whores"

[4:00:04] <allanmiri> @SoFarFetched Not sure how that makes it a pedo mmo. Is one of the creators a creep?
[4:00:04] <YakumoYomi> They gave Stars Wars to EA. Cage might be a step up.
[4:00:04] <+Whiskey_T_Foxtrot> is the star wars game by quantic dream france, or quantic dream NA?

[4:00:35] <cpt_langosta> metroid primes were made in texas
[4:00:35] <%g0atmeal> That's basically Japan
[4:00:37] <%GabeSweetMan> Which is European Texas.
[4:00:38] <+Shockrates20XX> Keighley loves Kojima, but Kojima basically makes American movies as games.

[4:01:04] <%Catpurnicus> its england's summer home that they can't visit easily any more
[4:01:05] <+Whiskey_T_Foxtrot> You're not wrong. They're all just the remnants of rome really.
[4:01:06] <mudapersona> SMT 5 atleast got nominee  so there's that
[4:01:06] <MicrotonalMatt> The VGAs might not be able to get rights to Japanese game stuff they’re really protective of that stuff
