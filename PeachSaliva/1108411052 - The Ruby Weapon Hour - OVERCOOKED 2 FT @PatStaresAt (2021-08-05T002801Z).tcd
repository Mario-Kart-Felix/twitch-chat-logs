[0:15:14] <+Whiskey_T_Foxtrot> yellow vs. whitepages
[0:15:15] <SomeOtherNeb> address here in France too
[0:15:15] <%pokefan9956> address was a thing
[0:15:17] <KineticZen> White pages still exist
[0:15:19] <DrkJP520> And social security info
[0:15:20] <%Fooguwu> You can totally still do that
[0:15:21] <GuyverTypeL> but you had to search tho
[0:15:22] <SilverFaustX> terminator doxxed ppl with a yellow page
[0:15:22] <cache_22> The address was a plotpoint in the Terminator movie.
[0:15:22] <ExpressNode> They have a website
[0:15:22] <%ShockzNDrawe> shit was different back then
[0:15:23] <%ssjklyco> Remember Penny Saver
[0:15:25] <%RayReborne> I saw addresses for a while yeah
[0:15:25] <+CatastropheCorvid> There was the Yellow pages and the White pages.
[0:15:28] <wolfen091> they're referred to as boomer pages now
[0:15:28] <%KeiganOfAstora> yup
[0:15:30] <person181> you would not BELIVE how much a phonebook would've helped me a couple of years ago
[0:15:30] <%maenos2> lot of info online paive
[0:15:31] <%GabiTheMermaid> I remember those times and it makes me feel paranoid
[0:15:31] <%JoshManVGH> Oh yeah, the phonebook is how Terminator tracked down sara conner @peachsaliva
[0:15:32] <$rdark_ksu> Address used to be there too
[0:15:33] <%MetroidSlayerP7> weren't there blue pages?
[0:15:34] <ncr7wms3r22b7n3> Now is probably worse
[0:15:37] <+CatastropheCorvid> Depends on whether you called and told them to not include you.
[0:15:38] <theshillman> I cannot swipe the pages, this book thing is broken
[0:15:38] <+lodwilk> Phone books are totally a thing still. I used to work in a Bell store and we would get seniors coming in to ask for them
[0:15:42] <$NitronStreams> the plot of the first terminator he use a phone book to find every sarah conner
[0:15:44] <%pokefan9956> we lived in a pre doxx society
[0:15:44] <%Fooguwu> voter registries are the new phonebooks
[0:15:47] <+ValkyrieProfiling> sure pat
[0:15:49] <Dunmarkh> used to use phone books, freaked people out
[0:15:50] <Ranger747> its how the Terminator does his thing
[0:15:50] <BoxNavy> you are soooo strong
[0:15:52] <%Sotetsu> So Strong
[0:15:54] <wolfen091> was that when 1 person lived in canada?
[0:15:57] <+NWR_James> damn
[0:16:00] <person181> and when in doubt you can use it as TP
[0:16:01] <PerfectPepperPlantPro> See if we had a camera Pat could prove this point
[0:16:01] <%Ranryu692> I forgot about phone books LUL
[0:16:02] <%KeiganOfAstora> Of course you do
[0:16:02] <Gehtingsberg> That’s literally the plot to terminater he finds the wrong Sarah Connor with a phonebook
[0:16:03] <%cade_calrayn> that's not relevant to the topic at hand, Paige
[0:16:06] <%MetroidSlayerP7> I learned how to tear phone books in college.  there's a trick to it!
[0:16:07] <cache_22> Are there payphones in Montreal?
[0:16:08] <%ssjklyco> The launch of the 360
[0:16:09] <+Whiskey_T_Foxtrot> phone books can also be used for hiding bruises dnoQUAN
[0:16:09] <%cade_calrayn> don't blow him up like this
[0:16:14] <Sartastic> wow, I didn't even realize they stopped phone books
[0:16:16] <%JoshManVGH> They are actually REALLY easy to tear apart. There is a technique

[0:23:04] <+Whiskey_T_Foxtrot> If the french had to sing their alphabet as a song it would make them want to speak english.
[0:23:07] <%ShockzNDrawe> We learned that exact song in gradeschool here
[0:23:08] <cervidaequus> The french language wants people with lisps to die

[0:24:12] <PerfectPepperPlantPro> VV vs UU
[0:24:13] <+RelikaNox> I still write in cursive because it's faster for me :(
[0:24:13] <DedlokPM> rooOWO
[0:24:15] <TheReallJimbo> VVho, VVhere, VVhat
[0:24:15] <$velgaduere> instead of what? your feet?
[0:24:16] <%Rumbutt> VuuV
[0:24:17] <DrkJP520> I had like one cursive class in school, and I never properly learned it.
[0:24:18] <+glescoron> "Patrick you little fuck, learn the curvy words!"
[0:24:18] <%maenos2> as opposed to writing with your nose
[0:24:19] <jtdobyns> the inly cursive i use is my name when i sign
[0:24:21] <Prism_Wing> Completely useless skill
[0:24:23] <faintsmile> cursive looks pretty but thats abt all its good for
[0:24:24] <%Ell1ot> remember when the teacher said that we would never carry a calculator with us all the time?
[0:24:24] <SovPho> @spongeofmystery v was w lol
[0:24:25] <M4eta> i can only write in cursive
[0:24:26] <Storm_Samurai> Gotta sign checks
[0:24:27] <+CptnCampy61> Then we typed everything on Da computer
[0:24:28] <%MetroidSlayerP7> cursive is great for fountain pens, and nothing else!!
[0:24:29] <%Ranryu692> every single time a teacher said "they won't let you do that in university" they were wrong
[0:24:30] <GarbageQueenEllie> Cursive gives my fingers fucking carpal tunnel each time I try it
[0:24:35] <%Rumbutt> UUhoa this is uueird
[0:24:37] <%GabiTheMermaid> Me too!! I thought it was just me
[0:24:38] <%BigCoffee> cursive is garbage
[0:24:39] <%BlowFireThroatTotem> When is peesh gonna give her cat some sick kisses and backflips?
[0:24:39] <Mr_JustinJones> I thought everything was written in cursive as a kid. That was a fucking lie
[0:24:40] <ExpressNode> So how would you say the game VVV in French?
[0:24:40] <valerios_> @MetroidSlayerP7 ayyy, fountain pen nerds unit
[0:24:43] <MarsKarl> that's speedrun writing!
[0:24:45] <+RandyFistburgers> same. I connect shit but only when it's faster so like every third letter
[0:24:47] <cache_22> Paige, did you have a Lisa Frank binder or notebooks in school?
[0:24:47] <BoxNavy> teachers love to lie
[0:24:47] <chaosbringer28> my cursive is slower, and harder to read because i forgot/merged like half the cursive letters
[0:24:49] <%RayReborne> BIG STUPID TEACHER SPECIFIC LIES
[0:24:49] <mr_saturday93> LUL
[0:24:50] <%BigCoffee> @ExpressNode vee vee vee
[0:24:51] <TheReallJimbo> I agree with Paige. cursive and regular writing mixed together
[0:24:55] <MarsKarl> combining cursive and print to create the fastest method of writing
[0:24:59] <%KeiganOfAstora> THAT WAS TRUE IN 2000 THO
[0:25:03] <osaka_daioh> OH GOSH CAT
[0:25:04] <HaroldDonchee> it was the only way to get shitkids to listen for most of them
[0:25:06] <Demonization89> wish i could go back and "ok boomer" every lie they told
[0:25:10] <%rumtumtugnutz> My favorite one is 'you'll use Algebra every day in your normal life.
[0:25:12] <OmegaWeltall> yea caluclators cost a buck, who cares
[0:25:12] <+Ynkubus_> You'll learn this in college / You should have been taught this in high school
[0:25:14] <%Ranryu692> it's because they're teaching logic via math
[0:25:16] <%patriotrenegade> Theres a book called "Lies My Teacher Told Me" but its about history
[0:25:17] <Prism_Wing> "If you do a good job, you'll get ahead"
[0:25:18] <%JenovasPuppet> The foreman slaps the phone out of your hand, "YOU WILL DO IT BY HAND!"
[0:25:19] <faintsmile> LUL
[0:25:20] <ToneBacas> LUL
[0:25:20] <wannabemoogle> I thought it was for hand eye coordination or hand motor skills
[0:25:21] <BoxNavy> EleGiggle
[0:25:22] <%KeiganOfAstora> Because you're in a store and you're trying to figure out a sale real quick
[0:25:24] <KineticZen> Cursive is superior because it doesn't look like a child's writing, and it's faster
[0:25:25] <PerfectPepperPlantPro> If you really want to be an asshole, you write everything in cursive and roman numerals
[0:25:25] <+thelonechris> I had a teacher who hid vodka in a bottle of projector cleaner and would take swigs out of it once a day
[0:25:27] <wolfen091> the only time I didn't have access to a calculator was when I had to take their tests where they didn't allow them
[0:25:28] <%MetroidSlayerP7> when was the last time you held a calculator?  the 80's?  got em.
[0:25:28] <+RandyFistburgers> *pulls out abicus and slide rule*

[0:27:09] <GarbageQueenEllie> Video games taught me that War Bad
[0:27:12] <+thelonechris> My parents believed that every game was GTA and that it trained people to be terrorists
[0:27:12] <%ComfortableStranger> i did a presentation at work on hellblade, my co-workers had no idea video games could tell a story
[0:27:25] <SovPho> @spongeofmystery correct, v is the syllable "wuh" hence vini = wini, vidi = widi, vici = wicki

[0:28:18] <Wiiplayah43> @ComfortableStranger Dang, seriously? That's decades behind.
[0:28:18] <%ComfortableStranger> @ComfortableStranger basically
[0:28:20] <+zamatermort> The wii was rad
[0:28:21] <DrkJP520> I've always had a wee.

[0:28:36] <iosephe> that's correct
[0:28:36] <ExpressNode> Oui Oui
[0:28:36] <Profmcstevie> Despite the wii
[0:28:37] <%dankjerri> MONSTER HUNTER TRI

[0:28:40] <+ValkyrieProfiling> ennwii
[0:28:40] <+CaptainJax> metroid prime 3?
[0:28:41] <%Bt_Robot> Metroid Corruption
[0:28:42] <$velgaduere> Trauma Center 2 on the Wii was great tho
[0:28:44] <+thelonechris> The one thing I miss the most is the infinite loads of shovelware that the Wii brought forth
[0:28:44] <BoxNavy> both are on switch
[0:28:44] <$velgaduere> loved that shit
[0:28:46] <Tampaoster> play okama
[0:28:49] <Doofmaster> the waggle shit is sus but the pointing was fine
[0:28:51] <+ThomasOfTroy> Okami was great
[0:28:52] <$Puhff> Skyrim Sword LUL
[0:28:54] <ZeeJiggle> Shattered Memories is best on Wii purely because of how good the flashlight was.
[0:28:58] <TheArrow_> wii sports was the only good waggle
[0:29:00] <%RayReborne> no it's pretty fucking Zelda
[0:29:02] <Profmcstevie> It's built like a zelda
[0:29:02] <TheReallJimbo> Okami hd is fantastic
[0:29:04] <%BigCoffee> I've never played Okami...
[0:29:04] <%ComfortableStranger> Okami is AMZING!!
[0:29:06] <%BlackStarAura> Okami is so pretty
[0:29:07] <%djazo> OKAMI 2 IS THE BEST
[0:29:10] <ExpressNode> Skyrim on PS3 was fucked
[0:29:11] <%ssjklyco> Okami is my favorite Zelda Trilogy
[0:29:14] <$kawajenarts> that's why I dodged Twilight Princess for the Wii and managed to snag a Gamecube version instead
[0:29:22] <Wiiplayah43> @Puhff They kind of have a point, there was very little outside of 1st party games.
[0:29:23] <%dankjerri> yeah its like 3 games
[0:29:29] <ExpressNode> Okami Den?
[0:29:34] <Profmcstevie> Shoulda stopped at the fox

[0:29:47] <wolfen091> yup
[0:29:48] <%big_boss_baby> The third section kinda sucks
[0:29:48] <%Bt_Robot> Skyward is out on Switch, you could check it out.  I wouldn't recommend it.
[0:29:49] <+ValkyrieProfiling> ouch
[0:29:49] <ergulor> but is indeed long
[0:29:49] <+ArcanumArcanum> STILL HOLDS UP
[0:29:49] <%BigCoffee> arent most Zeldas like fucking 10-15 hours long?
[0:29:52] <+greasypete00> I love that fact that Okami is as long as it is

[0:30:18] <$Puhff> CUZ TITS SELL
[0:30:18] <TheReallJimbo> elf titties
[0:30:19] <spongeofmystery> Viggo Mortensen is as old now as Ian McKellen was when he played Gandalf
[0:30:22] <xanerts> are tits in lotr?
[0:30:22] <%BinaryFireball> I dont think so though
[0:30:23] <devanmuse> Because why else would you watch the Amazon thing instead of just The movies?
[0:30:27] <+sabertoothzombie> that makes no sense
[0:30:28] <ExpressNode> Oh he's talking about the sections. Also Okami was like 25 hours. Not short but still good
[0:30:28] <NoctisxMog> it's confirmed isn't it,
[0:30:30] <%TheLakinessMonster> Don't let it bring you pain that it was 20 years ago, be smug that in 20 years nothing has surpassed it.
[0:30:31] <%MetroidSlayerP7> I wore chainmail armor to Return of the King.  3 hours in hot heavy armor.
[0:30:31] <HaroldDonchee> I really doubt they'll have tits
[0:30:32] <shieldecho> I feel that's an HBO streaming mandate, possibly less so with Amazon
[0:30:32] <TheReallJimbo> ork tities
[0:30:33] <TheArrow_> i don't think there has to be but i do think there will be
[0:30:34] <%Nordguy> NAZGUL TITTIES THO

[0:30:48] <%Fooguwu> naked jumping jacks are not appealing
[0:30:49] <%dankjerri> "ALL WILL LOOK UPON ME AND GET HARD'
[0:30:53] <KineticZen> I'm concerned they're going to try to make Tolkien's setting low fantasy, and it'll suck
[0:30:53] <%patriotrenegade> SPODER TIDDIES
[0:30:54] <%maenos2> yes amazon
[0:30:55] <NoctisxMog> yes
[0:30:56] <+machshop> yeah
[0:31:02] <%dankjerri> unfortunately
[0:31:02] <Storm_Samurai> Elf booba
[0:31:03] <moistborne> Vigo Mortensen is as old now as Ian McKellen was when they filmed LOTR if you wanna feel really old
[0:31:04] <%JoshManVGH> After the Shelob glam up in the video game, there would be a riot.
[0:31:04] <silkoh> Sauron nudes confirmed
[0:31:04] <$Puhff> DansGame
[0:31:08] <%pokefan9956> wheel of time is so fucking dry
[0:31:09] <%dankjerri> YOULL LOVE IT
[0:31:09] <%JenovasPuppet> "And my cock!"
[0:31:16] <%Ell1ot> i stopped reading that series because the original author died
[0:31:18] <GarbageQueenEllie> If only the writers in charge of this stuff weren't shit.
[0:31:18] <+RAGING_1NF3RNO> Vigo Mortensen is now as old as Ian McEllen when he was in LOTR.
[0:31:19] <+ValkyrieProfiling> yeyeye Shelob booba
[0:31:19] <%maenos2> BOOK PURGE?
[0:31:23] <%patriotrenegade> I found Wheel of Time excruciatingly boring
[0:31:25] <TheReallJimbo> no nudes on LOTR, you have to go to their only fans for that
[0:31:33] <+Taisuru> Just got here, did Paige break the vtuber?
[0:31:44] <%maenos2> @taisuru they downstairs
[0:31:45] <NoctisxMog> I know nothing about wot and I'm i interested
[0:31:46] <ExpressNode> Paige 451
[0:31:47] <%Fooguwu> come on Kingkillers Chronicles...
[0:31:47] <Piemono> Brandon Sanderson did a pretty good job
[0:31:48] <toyforus235> so the book good
[0:31:49] <MarsKarl> LUL
[0:31:50] <%dankjerri> the stormlight archives guy
[0:31:50] <%JenovasPuppet> Yeah but Brandon Sanderson took over and he can do no wrong.
[0:31:51] <+machshop> bernie sanders finished it PogChamp
[0:31:54] <KineticZen> Brandon Sanderson wrote the Stormlight Archive series
[0:32:10] <Arancet> no, robert jordan's wife chose brandon
[0:32:11] <%maenos2> Sanderson is a writing machine
[0:32:14] <%Lion_kun> Will B.S. finish Game of Thrones
[0:32:19] <+mutavault666> jordan picked sanderson before he died
[0:32:21] <%dankjerri> @peachsaliva brandon had such immaculate notes that the only difference is ablittle bit of writing style
[0:32:22] <%pokefan9956> Sanderson is so good
[0:32:42] <%maenos2> @lion_kun no, Sanderson said he wouldn't and besides GRRM said to burn his noted when he dies
[0:32:44] <GarbageQueenEllie> what's wheel of time even about? never heard of it
[0:32:45] <%Rumbutt> There is a chapter in the last last book that is longer than some other books in the series
[0:32:48] <+blastyoboots> @PeachSaliva Brandon Sanderson was given by the guy's wife the exhaustive notes because the guy knew he was possibly going to die, yeah.  The ending chapter is also completely written by the author verbatim he wanted it JUST RIGHT before he died
[0:32:49] <+Cthulos> Book 14 was the best because they were written by Sanderson
[0:32:50] <ExpressNode> This is gonna happen to GRRM
[0:32:55] <+ValkyrieProfiling> yikes
[0:32:56] <%JenovasPuppet> Sanderson did a really good job aping the style too.
[0:32:58] <%dankjerri> @peachsaliva the last chapter of wot is longer than the fjrst harry potter book
[0:33:02] <%BinaryFireball> but the CG
[0:33:10] <faintsmile> shoulda made it animated
[0:33:13] <$velgaduere> each book has to be its own show lmao
[0:33:18] <+Romuken> 70's show did it
[0:33:18] <%JenovasPuppet> "How do you do, fellow kids?"
[0:33:22] <Kezeract> Actors would love that tbf
[0:33:24] <%dankjerri> it would take 3 seasons to do Lord of Chaos
[0:33:26] <+RD_NX> What if they record backwards and release it in 40 years
[0:33:26] <%ComfortableStranger> animate it, voice actors don't age
[0:33:26] <%Ranryu692> if it does well
[0:33:27] <+Calek> actors play younger characters all the time despite being older
[0:33:37] <+greasypete00> what series are they talking about?
[0:33:42] <HaroldDonchee> dude just make it like a soap opera
[0:33:48] <%dankjerri> they literally  cant

[0:34:07] <TheReallJimbo> soooo, Overcooked, right?
[0:34:09] <%RayReborne> THATS ONE PIECE PLOT LAYER
[0:34:10] <%Rumbutt> The first book was supposed to end where the THIRD book does! It was supposed to be a trilogy!!!
[0:34:11] <+mutavault666> they should animate it
[0:34:11] <%Ell1ot> some GoT people got recast
[0:34:12] <%RayReborne> hinting
[0:34:17] <$velgaduere> @TheReallJimbo nope, books, strap in kid
[0:34:18] <+Dova573> Sounds like oda lol

[0:34:56] <Piemono> Wolves are like a super big thing in the WoT
[0:34:56] <TheReallJimbo> I'm not new here, I just like to bring it up occasionally
[0:34:58] <%JenovasPuppet> Do not pretend for a MOMENT that you will remember those wolves!
[0:34:59] <DrkJP520> What did you say this book series was called?

[0:35:19] <mr_saturday93> everyone fucks
[0:35:20] <GarbageQueenEllie> Paige is DESPERATE for some high fantasy novel tiddies

[0:35:40] <Gehtingsberg> sipsipGasm
[0:35:43] <+blastyoboots> okay that's fair
[0:35:49] <%dankjerri> @peachsaliva Robert Jordan had a lot to say on gender power dynamics
[0:35:52] <%Rumbutt> yeah 11 was a slog
[0:35:58] <MarsKarl> Sanderson has inherited Jordan's ability to make a book take 400 pages more than it needs to
[0:36:02] <Piemono> There's like 2-3 books in the last half of that series that are just a fucking drag
[0:36:03] <+PenmanLupine> I can never get through Stormlight Archive. Shallan chapters fucking halt everything and I lose so much interest I can never keep going. and Kalladins depression ride really never feels like it's going anywhere
[0:36:04] <RayCSmooth> the final nut

[0:36:55] <BoxNavy> books bad
[0:36:57] <GarbageQueenEllie> omg it's a furry thing
[0:37:00] <$Wurmspawn> Pat used to read, then he took a pen to the knee.
[0:37:01] <%Ranryu692> I used to read books, and then I didn't have any book stores in walking distance anymore so I stopped
[0:37:02] <+SenorCounter> It goes on and on my friend
[0:37:04] <ExpressNode> I used to read books but then anime happened and I read light novels
[0:37:06] <+Taisuru> does Redwall fucks
[0:37:07] <osaka_daioh> My gosh XD I haven't been at a Paige and Pat stream is such a long time. This is such good stuff.
[0:37:10] <TheReallJimbo> I don't like to read books, does that make me dumb, Paige?
[0:37:12] <TheReallJimbo> that's mean
[0:37:22] <kingmemelord97> HungryPaimon
[0:37:23] <Nekros4442> Redwall is absolutely furry shit
[0:37:23] <+cvp5127> LUL
[0:37:23] <%cade_calrayn> @PeachSaliva throwing yourself off a cliff would require lifting Zangief off of you and that's not possible
[0:37:24] <%Nordguy> nateyb2Wave nateyb2Wave nateyb2Wave
[0:37:28] <+Romuken> show
[0:37:28] <+SenorCounter> Super Furry
[0:37:30] <+ratchetex> uwu
[0:37:31] <%Ranryu692> oh no, my childhood
[0:37:32] <Coystick> MICE FUCK?
[0:37:33] <%MetroidSlayerP7> I have a hard time reading books because of the ADHD.  Audiobooks, though
[0:37:36] <GarbageQueenEllie> looool
[0:37:36] <%JenovasPuppet> But are the mice the same size as the badgers?
[0:37:36] <CanadianAnimatorGuy> I'm not even furry but redwall is RAD
[0:37:37] <+zamatermort> It is but it isn't
[0:37:38] <Gehtingsberg> LUL
[0:37:41] <%ComfortableStranger> peach and woolie streaming at the  same time? thats gotta be a first
[0:37:42] <DracaenaLeaf> It never awokened anything from my friendgroup
[0:37:43] <+blastyoboots> @PeachSaliva Robert Jordan's writing is kind of stretched out and overlong.  To me the best books in the Wheel of Time were actually the last books because Brandon Sanderson wrote them and he's better at giving the readers what they all want, like _Mat being sassy and pulling something out of his ass_
[0:37:44] <MarsKarl> Brian Jacques was partially inspired by reading books to the visually impaired, that's why he uses such descriptive writing that appeals to other senses!
[0:37:44] <TheReallJimbo> fursonas
[0:37:45] <+thelonechris> Yes it does
[0:37:45] <faintsmile> YOU SAID paige
[0:37:47] <dizimous> It's furry
[0:37:48] <%Sotetsu> It started before Minerva Minx?
[0:37:49] <jerobees> You gotta start the kids on the furries while they're young
[0:37:50] <%patriotrenegade> @PeachSaliva Did you read Warrior Cats

[0:38:26] <%cade_calrayn> yeah.... famished for that furry shit
[0:38:28] <Coystick> Writing about food and sex are the two crutches for writing
[0:38:29] <$SinisterBroccoli> r r Martin does his food good
[0:38:32] <%dankjerri> i need that turkey leg
[0:38:35] <%Bt_Robot> Well, yeah.  Tolkien was English
[0:38:35] <Piemono> That series sucks

[0:39:48] <+ratchetex> bioshock is about how that book is dumb
[0:39:48] <faintsmile> even politics aside its just total ass
[0:39:49] <KineticZen> But yes, Ayn Rand is a terrible writer
[0:39:50] <%YakumoYomi> What? An Ayn Rand book is bad?
[0:39:53] <Coystick> Anal Brand
[0:39:56] <overlord_nico> It’s very dry
[0:39:57] <%Bt_Robot> AND STEEL\
[0:40:00] <F_manS> I got a third of the way through atlus strugged and dropped it, its really fucking boring.
[0:40:02] <Piemono> Is it surprising that Zack Snyder is a huge fan of Ayn Rand/
[0:40:03] <%ComfortableStranger> yeah ayn rand was a misanthrope
[0:40:04] <+thelonechris> @freelancebabymaker The sequel, Ready Player two, is even worse somehow
[0:40:05] <%Monkeyweed21> AYN RAND HAS NO IDEA HOW ECONOMICS OR LOGISTICS WORK
[0:40:10] <HaroldDonchee> I mean what did poor people ever do for me?
[0:40:12] <Doofmaster> hot take: Ayn Rand also not a great philosopher
[0:40:14] <%GabiTheMermaid> Very boring, read it in economics blargh
[0:40:16] <MarsKarl> Pull Yourself Up By the Boostraps: The Book: The Game: The Movie
[0:40:16] <%ssjklyco> You mean the prequel to Bioshock?
[0:40:19] <+delilah4you> No vTuber tonight?
[0:40:23] <%JoshManVGH> the main character gets sodimized by a pain stick for several months! It goes on for chapters!
[0:40:30] <Kezeract> "I'm rich af, so my opinion matters" - Ayn Rand, probably
[0:40:31] <+blastyoboots> @PeachSaliva Quote from John Rogers: “There are two novels that can change a bookish fourteen-year old’s life: The Lord of the Rings and Atlas Shrugged. One is a childish fantasy that often engenders a lifelong obsession with its unbelievable heroes, leading to an emotionally stunted, socially crippled adulthood, unable to deal with the real world. The other, of course, involves orcs."
[0:40:32] <F_manS> John Galt is a libertarian wet dream.
[0:40:35] <twistedj3ster> they fucked off to epsteins iirc
[0:40:38] <freelancebabymaker> @thelonechris what did they move on to 90s references every paragraph instead of 80s ones?
[0:40:40] <TheFramedWarlock> You mean the book where a character LITERALLY goes on a 40 page speech
[0:40:40] <%JoshManVGH> I fucking hate the sword of truth!
[0:40:41] <%MetroidSlayerP7> Atlas Shrugged is like 30000 pages
[0:40:45] <%MetroidSlayerP7> why?!
[0:40:49] <KingSwansJamboree> that sounds worse than the wall of text in 1984
[0:40:49] <%Sadira_snack_attack> yeah the speech.....in unbroken paragraphs. its fucking painful

[2:11:03] <Tracazoid> Healer life is suffering
[2:11:04] <+RealThiele> healers are angry god-complex
[2:11:05] <person181> lead by being BIG AND STRONG
[2:11:08] <+ValkyrieProfiling> healers in mmo are concentrated salt
[2:11:09] <Omiba98> i think paige would be ok as a tank
[2:11:09] <+MisterAvry> ayy off tank is where its at
[2:11:10] <%LeiaSkynoober> Can confirm, my static healer is always pissed

[2:11:11] <mike2hands> im a healer......BUT
[2:11:11] <+derrigible> I like being healing lol
[2:11:12] <%polothegreatest> healers are underapreciated
[2:11:16] <PocketBearIllustrator> I say be a tank. PLD is easy to learn.
[2:11:17] <person181> be a fisher main paige
[2:11:17] <BoxNavy> then be tank
[2:11:17] <NeroInfinite> Be a DPS
[2:11:19] <Explodincatz> dps easiest to learn an MMO

[2:11:19] <+Kinoskae> Be a Dragoon and be a Floor Tank
[2:11:22] <%JenovasPuppet> Warrior Paige makes way too much sense
[2:11:23] <Omiba98> BIG AND STRONG TANK
[2:11:24] <+Birdigalore> Start as black mage and switch to red mage for ultimate brain-off experience
[2:11:24] <BoxNavy> JUST BE TANK PAT WILL TEACH YOU
[2:11:24] <Psyramics> then be lancer
[2:11:24] <Alice_Lufenia> And I got ONE comm on that one!
[2:11:25] <Clyderso> I bet Paige is Lala
[2:11:26] <+RealThiele> Paigeadin
[2:11:29] <blue8moon> just be samurai

[2:11:35] <%Rumbutt> tanking is the chillest thing in 14
[2:11:39] <+thedannydarko> Nah paige is gonna make a big beefy hroth
[2:11:40] <lloyddboy> DPS LIKE BLUB ORN
[2:11:43] <person181> be gunbraker so you can be the BIG DAMAGE and the leader
[2:11:46] <+MisterTylerrr> Tank is the main charcter
[2:11:47] <@SoFarFetched> Paige I play tank I can help geefPlz
[2:11:47] <@Jekado> just DPS
[2:11:49] <$Sphincter_Spelunker> @PeachSaliva Tanks have to know the boss fights
[2:11:49] <+MisterAvry> find a bossy healer and make them lead
[2:11:49] <%JenovasPuppet> Just play Blue Mage
[2:11:51] <Alice_Lufenia> Tank initiates, but you can lead from any role
[2:11:52] <nibble_nuts> DPS can get the idea of how battles go without having the heaviest responsibilities, its good way to observe first
[2:11:52] <Profmcstevie> Leader! But leader.....but leader! But leader.....
[2:11:52] <%cade_calrayn> Paige wants to be a tanky DPS
[2:11:54] <%AncelDeLambert> omg
[2:11:55] <Omiba98> Tanking isnt too bad to start off
[2:11:57] <Dunmarkh> paige play dragoon?
[2:11:57] <Tracazoid> Want big and strong but not the leadership role that comes with
[2:11:58] <+Aeoneth> Play Dragoon  you can floor tank
[2:12:01] <@Jekado> BE A DRAGOON THEY ALWAYS TANK AND DPS!
[2:12:02] <%Puhff> Leader doesnt mean Guide
[2:12:03] <theshillman> Umi-dah!
[2:12:04] <BoxNavy> tanking is scary to do though i hate it
[2:12:09] <%AncelDeLambert> just let her be a Marauder
[2:12:09] <Profmcstevie> Paiges strength
[2:12:11] <blue8moon> good thing paige has been practicing throw
[2:12:12] <+Erictron4000> Being a tank in 14 is easy
[2:12:14] <NeroInfinite> Then play a monk.
[2:12:23] <+RealThiele> blergh monk
[2:12:24] <%mighty_max_t> I wish I could get into FF14, the combat just doesn't appeal to me
[2:12:24] <+MisterAvry> I really started enjoying WoW back in the day when death knights came out and I started tanking
[2:12:28] <%Kenzo2000> The trick to tanking is to just walk in with your dick swinging and remember to pop rampart
[2:12:32] <%Puhff> Ninja can KINDA off tank
[2:12:36] <@Jekado> another potato
[2:12:39] <CrimsonFox777> Pah-tay-ter
[2:12:40] <Alice_Lufenia> I'm tank main, can confirm is fun and easier than people think
[2:12:41] <%AncelDeLambert> you literally don't have to do anything other than keep your tank specific aura up until level 50
[2:12:48] <wasdsf> oh god switch
[2:12:52] <%JenovasPuppet> Delicious ground food

[2:23:34] <%mighty_max_t> I'm a little skeptical of chat....
[2:23:38] <@SoFarFetched> me and Jekado can be part of the jackbox party
[2:23:38] <%TheLakinessMonster> letting people win breeds weakness into their hearts
[2:23:39] <@SoFarFetched> geefPlz
[2:23:41] <%AncelDeLambert> Paige I will be REASONABLY nice to you
[2:23:42] <PocketBearIllustrator> I would absolutely love to play with y'all, but it's nearly 4 in the morning and I need my sleep.
[2:23:42] <%RayReborne> don't let win, just play bad
[2:23:48] <Srthunda> thats not your character trait
[2:23:48] <%JenovasPuppet> "All those times I lost? I totally LET you win"
[2:23:49] <%Dakuu75> Yeah, SoFarFetched has a good mic, let them play
[2:23:49] <+Scevda> How do we join?
[2:23:50] <$Sphincter_Spelunker> it's fun
[2:24:00] <%optimasmaximas> get the mods in as the other contestants
[2:24:04] <@Jekado> your gonna need more then 2 people in jackbox
[2:24:04] <%GabiTheMermaid> I’m excited
[2:24:05] <%KeiganOfAstora> @PeachSaliva "Letting someone win is like faking an orgasm. Every guy's done it at least once"
[2:24:06] <NeroInfinite> The audience can play.

[2:24:28] <+McSoliace> i subconsciously let people win
[2:24:30] <eyeobject> Old spousal abuse the stream
[2:24:32] <%mighty_max_t> I don't let people win, I just play on their level. If people don't know how to throw fireballs, I won't either

[3:44:02] <%mighty_max_t> I believe so?
[3:44:02] <%Ozavic> YES
[3:44:03] <@Jekado> The audience is the poll and You guys have to guess what our procentages are.
[3:44:03] <Profmcstevie> Yes because we have a big audience
[3:44:03] <ska234> hmm
[3:44:04] <+Basker17> creepy49Porpkek creepy49Porpkek creepy49Porpkek
[3:44:04] <Explodincatz> time for VPN to screw up the results
[3:44:05] <ska234> so
[3:44:06] <+ThomasOfTroy> The site asked us what WE use
[3:44:06] <%alternative_flu> nvm the audience data
[3:44:07] <@SoFarFetched> YEAH AUDIENCE
[3:44:07] <californaya> yeah, this is based on the audience
[3:44:09] <%ClericOfSparda> It's weird
[3:44:09] <missingangle> If a game does not have an audience, it uses global data
[3:44:09] <%JenovasPuppet> WE CONTROL YOUR FATE
[3:44:10] <PettyFunk> I think it's audience data unless there aren't enough responses
[3:44:11] <@SoFarFetched> WE CHOSE THE ANSWERS
[3:44:14] <puppetthebun> because there is an audience, it pools from the audience now instead of the global stats
[3:44:15] <ska234> audience data is TWITCH CHAT
[3:44:15] <+McSoliace> more people joined
[3:44:16] <%GabeSweetMan> We have psaBig audience
[3:44:16] <mylilmunchlaxx> audience answers you guess the percentage of the audience
[3:44:17] <benjiFG> OUR VOTE MATTERS
[3:44:17] <%Ozavic> Enough people answered
[3:44:18] <Dunmarkh> yeah because you're a streamer
[3:44:19] <%polothegreatest> OH NO
[3:44:19] <switchbored505> When the audience are big enough, we are the data
[3:44:20] <SpaceManHotepIV> It's based on us. The game uses global data with a small enough audience
[3:44:20] <Sol_Install> OH BOY
[3:44:21] <$AzureGale> This isn't rocket science Pat
[3:44:21] <SwindlerOfProgress> Probably got enough people in the audience

[3:44:38] <+I4gotmyname89> in chat
[3:44:38] <+MooseIsGoose> No the audience
[3:44:39] <Jetsfantasy> IT'S ASKING THE AUDIENCE THIS QUESTION
[3:44:39] <+zamatermort> Pat, it is the audiance
[3:44:40] <%7gryphons> people in the audience, not the world!
[3:44:41] <+kaniasaurus> IN THE AUDIANCE
[3:44:41] <Ravioli_Ronin> Oh no it’s a bad sample size LUL LUL LUL
[3:44:41] <%baronblank> in this audience
[3:44:41] <Mr_JustinJones> no in audience
[3:44:42] <ska234> I think so.
[3:44:43] <mylilmunchlaxx> we the stream audience
[3:44:43] <+thecowpow> this is VERY different depending on the show, pretty easy to binge a 12 episode season
[3:44:44] <%polothegreatest> NO PEOPLE, THE CHAT
[3:44:45] <%AmanDotZip> audience
[3:44:45] <%ClericOfSparda> IT'S BASED OFF CHAT
[3:44:46] <Sartastic> ppl are unconcentrated!!
[3:44:47] <%GabeSweetMan> It's just YOUR audience.
[3:44:47] <puppetthebun> THIS AUDIENCE RIGHT NOW
[3:44:47] <%AncelDeLambert> multiple TV shows are 13 episodes a season
[3:44:49] <freelancebabymaker> i watched all of invincible in one day 6 times in a row lol
[3:44:49] <+PolarBearPat> its polling the audience
[3:44:50] <Sol_Install> It's based on the audience in the game
[3:44:50] <%Ranryu692> @PeachSaliva it's polling the audience
[3:44:53] <gustavozxd> binge watching sucks, i can't remember shit like a day later LUL
[3:44:53] <Skatedeandre> yeah you're guessing what percentage of us will say we binged
[3:44:53] <X2Eliah> This game mode is kinda fucked with chat
[3:44:54] <Profmcstevie> Pat it's Global presumed until it's enough of an audience
[3:44:55] <@CreepyPorpoise> YES
[3:44:57] <%SharkMissile> Porp and Peach!!
[3:44:57] <leinadtonu> Chat ain't people
[3:44:59] <%GabeSweetMan> How well do you know YOUR audience!
[3:44:59] <mylilmunchlaxx> chat is the statistic
[3:44:59] <@SoFarFetched> If you were JUST playing with other people,it would be global results. BUT becuase  you're playing with chat,it's CHAT results not global.
[3:44:59] <ska234> lmao
[3:45:00] <+Rekinsinn> global stats are a fallback for if you dont play with an audience
[3:45:01] <+Fefe41> WE ALL NEED A LIFE
[3:45:02] <%cade_calrayn> I love that Paige's character is blind
[3:45:02] <Omiba98> PogChamp
[3:45:04] <$AzureGale> What part of "they're polling the audience" is so hard to understand
[3:45:05] <+Dunder_Mifflinz> The game is playing up the whole "Global data" thing but it's using the audience
[3:45:05] <@CreepyPorpoise> What does that say about me and Paige.
[3:45:07] <%Ranryu692> did someone DC?
[3:45:08] <switchbored505> The data pool is the audience, since the audience is large enough
[3:45:09] <humble_hill_dweller> Pat's Boomer Brain is kicking in.
[3:45:11] <Sartastic> oh no, I'm a fool
[3:45:12] <%JenovasPuppet> Good job throwing for Paige's birthday, Pat
[3:45:13] <@Jekado> Oh is the Audience Higher or lower then the average
[3:45:14] <+burumorning> @PeachSaliva Audience answers are used when more than 5 people answer in the audience! Global is a fallback!

[3:45:17] <SovPho> GOD WHY IS IT THE STEAM MESSAGE SOUND
[3:45:18] <%baronblank> it switched once you had an audience
[3:45:19] <$Niney_Who> That means it's loading pat, It defaults to that cause Video game
[3:45:19] <thetruenicster> It switched cause Audience
[3:45:20] <mylilmunchlaxx> when enough of people joined the audience
[3:45:21] <$AzureGale> THERE WAS NO SWITCHING
[3:45:22] <SpaceManHotepIV> It switched when the audience got big enough
[3:45:22] <+MooseIsGoose> We have a big enough audience
