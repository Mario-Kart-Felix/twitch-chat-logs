[1:02:01] <+KombatxKarlx18> Someone actually wrote this
[1:02:02] <Finakala> It writ itself into existence
[1:02:02] <$NitronStreams> I give this 10 out of 10 Skulls crying bloody tears
[1:02:03] <+Noeralf31> it manifested from the dark parts of the intenet, long ago
[1:02:03] <+allups> trollf
[1:02:03] <Fabric_tester> Yes
[1:02:04] <CappuccinoGuil> Embrace the cringe
[1:02:04] <+chuckyswiss> LOL WTF
[1:02:05] <%dankjerri> this is entirely sincere
[1:02:05] <%krymzen5> cant tell
[1:02:07] <%ssjklyco> I mean, someone has to write a troll fic
[1:02:08] <%ArtemisM822> This has to be a troll
[1:02:08] <Cynical2DD> Nyanners collab when
[1:02:09] <boomstickery> it was written by teh penguin of dooom lol holds up spork
[1:02:09] <pixeldust48> whether this was a trollfic or not is beyond mortal knowledge
[1:02:09] <Yukai_Yami> Omikron wishes it was this iconic
[1:02:09] <$rdark_ksu> genuine or not we still suffer
[1:02:11] <%king_wragles> I think this proves God is real and he is unkind and uncarring
[1:02:11] <OneThousandTomatoes> these kind of fanfics are too common for everyone to be a troll
[1:02:12] <+pohlcat93> I've been reading fanfiction for 20 years, it's real
[1:02:12] <GarbageQueenEllie> BOLTH
[1:02:13] <EliRegis> I dont think it was a troll fic
[1:02:13] <%ArtemisM822> Please let it be a troll
[1:02:14] <RangerJ95> may e its just the vtubing but you voice sounds more gremlin like.
[1:02:15] <@ckbooks> My Immortal is too incoherent to be a troll.
[1:02:16] <+Mr_y1096> i think its genuine
[1:02:16] <GoodnightSnek> My immortal is a genuine master piece from the heart no trolling here
[1:02:17] <+chuckyswiss> This is real
[1:02:17] <+ScrapKingKeita> It's bad in such a way that can only be pulled from sincere 200X 14 year olds
[1:02:18] <jowi_time> wrote it. too cringy not to be LUL
[1:02:18] <DedlokPM> Somebody actually wrote tjs troll fic
[1:02:20] <+saltpiggu> I mean, I think somebody actually wrote this as a troll fic

[1:02:23] <thelonechris> Cringe will make you strong
[1:02:26] <Wiiplayah43> I'm impressed how ambiguous it is, whether it's real or troll
[1:02:27] <%Sotetsu> Spoon feed me this cringe
[1:02:28] <EliRegis> I used to write on the net, as a cringey teen
[1:02:30] <TheChucklingOak> There's some shit later that REALLY makes me question things.
[1:02:31] <+Noeralf31> you may think the cringe is your friend, but I was BORN from it
[1:02:32] <Hawkbone_> Whether or not My Immortal is a trollfic is one of the greatest question of all time. Nobody will ever know the answer.
[1:02:33] <+Noeralf31> MOLDED by it
[1:02:34] <balthazar758> the truth is locked behind the cringelords
[1:02:34] <+chuckyswiss> So real
[1:02:35] <EliRegis> I think its real
[1:02:38] <%krymzen5> its very spot on if its a troll

[1:20:19] <GoodnightSnek> Talking to text on a screen EZ talking to people in a call SCARY
[1:20:20] <capnbeefs> That cod piece is quite something
[1:20:21] <Sirtimbob> I just arrived late. Are you 100% vtuber now?

[1:20:29] <leto_ii_muadibadder> shy is scary CrreamAwk
[1:20:30] <Hawkbone_> @SoFarFetched I know, I was making a joke
[1:20:33] <KLouDraws> an extroverted introvert?
[1:20:33] <eyeobject> art hashtag
[1:20:34] <floornine> @sirtimbob 50%
[1:20:35] <SomersaultJustice> you're hopped up on goofballs befpre the stream so you can be outgoing
[1:20:35] <$hattrick61> does plague use his vtuber
[1:20:38] <$AmanDotZip> social media presence and real life is different it makes sense
[1:20:40] <BigManLugan> but hand turkey
[1:20:47] <@SoFarFetched> @Hawkbone_ ah all good LUL chat's going very fast here and got some new people
[1:20:47] <%KendallLitDinner> So are you a 'quiet extravert,' like me?

[1:20:49] <those_bananas> Collab with plague cat
[1:20:50] <RyuuAoi> She gotta warm up to ya first
[1:20:50] <%NeonLight> Maybe the 2D image will help with that?
[1:20:58] <$AmanDotZip> i used to think i was an introvert until i couldnt go out due to pandemic
[1:21:00] <+RealThiele> jesus no

[1:21:04] <$Deadpal> I'm introverted as fuck. it's completely different then shy. I'm NOT shy and introverted lol.
[1:21:05] <%Sotetsu> You like attention, which conflicts with your shyness
[1:21:07] <%BoxNavy> yayaya the hand turkey
[1:21:08] <%CommanderSqueaks> Hand Turkey is the highest caliber artwork, it deserves to be framed.
[1:21:08] <+pohlcat93> but sometime it's like ripping off a bandaid
[1:21:09] <$AmanDotZip> i will draw fox BOOBA paige
[1:21:10] <Quilltaz> Theres a big difference between reading glorious art to viewers and asking another vtuber you maybe aint ever talked to to suddenly collab
[1:21:11] <OneThousandTomatoes> I think debuts mostly have hashtags for fanart and lewd fanart
[1:21:15] <jrpg_torkelson> I can't tell if this is cursed or not.
[1:21:16] <+grassglassgass> ears
[1:21:18] <Hawkbone_> Is this canon?
[1:21:18] <paladin_guy_> I'm pretty sure several of the Vshojo and Indy folks would love to work with you!

[1:21:28] <@Jekado> Paige puts hand turkey on wall then someone new in chat asks "DID YOUR KID DRAW THAT" geefSmugAF
[1:21:28] <person181> paige is a walking oxymoron
[1:21:28] <%BoxNavy> that dastardly green witch
[1:21:30] <TheChucklingOak> It's why the curse is evil, you see
[1:21:30] <%hewlettfan96> Play it by ear
[1:21:31] <ChungusQuest> Hope to see a full-size Skelmo lounging in the armchair
[1:21:31] <$StaceMcGate> What is the Witch's name?
[1:21:32] <Wiiplayah43> @AmanDotZip Introverts still like to go out sometimes, just not as much.
[1:21:32] <those_bananas> You got tags?
[1:21:32] <%abadbadman> everyone likes attention to some point
[1:21:34] <$AmanDotZip> im pretty sure every human likes attention
[1:21:37] <+Angelnickl> An animated gief running up to the window then running away would be cute.
[1:21:37] <%Ranryu692> they're not as mutually exclusive as you might think
[1:21:39] <%Sotetsu> She couldn't pronounce my name. :(

[1:54:05] <KingSwansJamboree> @ShogunNoonto if you feel you relate to the experiences/traits it can help a lot with understanding how/why you react in certain ways! I was diagnosed early and it really does help me approach things (tho be aware you might have difficulty getting a dx as an adult, brain stuff's still steeped in stereotypes unfortunately).
