[0:25:17] <%cade_calrayn> Paige, I'm pretty sure all of chat would agree when I say I'd rather have you stream without a camera than not stream at all :)

[0:26:23] <%Bloomingzonda> Paige have you considered that when you are having the lupus you could do some sweet juggalo streams to hide the red Kappa
[0:26:26] <+imthewisejanitor> We're here for the laughs and good times.
[0:26:31] <%cade_calrayn> We're here to watch and listen to you play. Your actual visual reactions are just a bonus and aren't necessary
[0:26:41] <+Freakin_Wolfy> It's an incantation
[0:26:41] <marvel877> Stream with that one still image of Elmo.
[0:26:44] <%king_wragles> @PeachSaliva weapons menu
[0:26:48] <+ReefTheWizard> armaments are weapons, poison armament was an incantation or sorcery
[0:26:48] <%FacetiousAF> the elmo blep
[0:26:49] <heartlesshealer> I remember when your back hurt and you just had the Elmo streams. We all appreciated it back then, it's fine to go without camera
[0:26:53] <%king_wragles> OH, you're looking for poison blade
[0:26:55] <peachy996> I mean the days of the Old channel had the guys off camera. It doesn't bug me none if you're not on camera
[0:27:00] <+ReefTheWizard> 2 stupid 5 spell
[0:27:02] <FishSkeleton> Not everyone even likes facecam, that was a big debate for the group on Pat's previous channel
[0:27:03] <%king_wragles> Poison blade just adds poison to a weapon
[0:27:04] <+Freakin_Wolfy> It's an incantation, it goes by faith I think
[0:27:05] <+ReefTheWizard> rip
[0:27:08] <orpleborple> he speen
[0:27:11] <+ReefTheWizard> blood rot
[0:27:12] <%king_wragles> It's a good spell, I use it a ton
[0:27:16] <%AncelDeLambert> well at least read it, maybe you CAN cast it
[0:27:22] <%cade_calrayn> Oh yeah, *never* get off the horse here, if you get knocked, immediately get back on
[0:27:25] <@CreepyPorpoise> don't worry, I was too feeble and bad with my hands to shoot an arrow yesterday in this game.
[0:27:26] <dan_g_v> rolling just coats you in the shit, Paige
[0:27:27] <+ReefTheWizard> god this is amazing
[0:27:35] <%cade_calrayn> You may have red orbs in your inventory?
[0:27:37] <+ReefTheWizard> arrow in your foot
[0:27:37] <dan_g_v> soap
[0:27:38] <bundle_of_herbs> soap i think!
[0:27:40] <%king_wragles> @PeachSaliva that's the fun part! You don't!
[0:27:42] <%cade_calrayn> Top of the tools menu?
[0:27:48] <%cade_calrayn> You can also craft them
[0:27:51] <CurrySauseBandit> There's a Miracle to cure it as well.
[0:27:55] <dan_g_v> soap washes poison5at least
[0:27:57] <FishSkeleton> Miyazaki: I JUST CAN'T HELP MYSELF I NEED TO SWAAAAMP
[0:27:58] <%Bloomingzonda> I got rid of my rot by going to the state health office and getting some penicillan
[0:28:21] <%cade_calrayn> @PeachSaliva they're called Stanching Boluses and they look like red orbs in your Tools menu
[0:28:42] <%cade_calrayn> you can craft all of them
[0:28:43] <%king_wragles> Oh hey, you have 2 gold seeds to increase your flasks
[0:28:46] <%AncelDeLambert> I mean, there is that miracle focus that scales off strength you should own
[0:28:56] <%FacetiousAF> @FishSkeleton oh god i'm gonna blighttown Kreygasm
[0:29:08] <leinadtonu> Exploration is really rewarding in this game.
[0:29:13] <+vehementvadr> I got rid of my rot with some sukaan
[0:29:26] <%FacetiousAF> the real reason we want the face cam on is to bully you about your glasses
[0:29:38] <+coward_man> well you done shitloads more than me!
[0:30:03] <%MooseIsGoose> Have you gone to the south of the caelid the big castle.
[0:30:11] <bundle_of_herbs> the infection (souls games) spreads!
[0:30:36] <+imthewisejanitor> I was aimlessly exploring in Horizon Zero Dawn, and I found my all-time favorite outdoor concert venue, I didn't even know that they put it IN the game to explore. Such a great surprise.
[0:30:46] <%cade_calrayn> Yeah, the north half of Caelid is much higher level than the rest
[0:30:47] <Sunstalker> D told you about a teleporter
[0:31:01] <Sunstalker> It's very intended to make players get thrown about the map
[0:31:02] <%adamthreetimes> There are fun things to do in Elden Ring that aren't just fighting so I get why folks who normally don't like Souls games dig it.
[0:31:05] <%cade_calrayn> I've been doing the same, I got my ex to try Elden Ring
[0:31:21] <+coward_man> I think this might be my favorite souls game purely because the exploration is so much better than the old games
[0:31:28] <peachy996> Death is a learning experience in these games
[0:31:38] <$hewlettfan96> Hey peachy how u doing today??
[0:31:40] <peachy996> Really in most games
[0:31:49] <peachy996> @hewlettfan96 can't complain
[0:31:59] <peachy996> Oh lol
[0:32:01] <%MooseIsGoose> I have not found this place
[0:32:08] <peachy996> My name is unfortunate LUL
[0:32:17] <+wizard_of_diamonds> <3
[0:32:18] <Spydurman> hell ya, good brain day
[0:32:26] <%tentavision> the only fail state is when you stop trying. until then the process is ongoing. if you aren't finished you can't have failed
[0:32:41] <+vehementvadr> next Miyazaki will make a dmv waiting simulator, then you'll understand the craving for death
[0:32:41] <TallYoda08> woolieSHOOK Early stream
[0:32:44] <%MooseIsGoose> death
[0:32:48] <%Jackgar> Jackgar subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 6 months, currently on a 6 month streak! We be doing the big and strong
[0:32:54] <+ReefTheWizard> @tentavision thats like the whole metaphor of hollowing out.
[0:33:10] <+ReefTheWizard> you hollow out when you quit trying, thats when you fail
[0:33:17] <dan_g_v> there's a weapon art that let's you quick dash in the wqtet
[0:33:18] <%Jackgar> Come Back later is a very valid strategy in this game
[0:33:19] <%Bloomingzonda> Something I was thinking about with Elden Ring is I think a lot of the reactions on both sides are because its essentially first blockbuster RPG to come out in 6 years
[0:33:30] <Broand> I have never eaten a legitimate pancake thicker than 1mm thick. Crepes forever
[0:33:41] <shanna_become_gamer> "fuck this for now" is gonna be a new motto for me
[0:33:50] <peachy996> It also helps that the open world in this isn't bland and lifeless
[0:33:51] <secret_npc> lmao death is absolutely a failstate, I think people just like the sound of themselves talking about Souls games
[0:34:01] <peachy996> Like a majority of open world games
[0:34:01] <+stickygumbolee> is your build pure unga bunga?
[0:34:12] <djblue_shift> Whoa early peach strim
[0:34:17] <%Jackgar> It's fun to see how different the routes people take are. I have like the whole northwest dealt with but I've barely touched the east outside of some secret areas
[0:34:20] <+ReefTheWizard> i  had to step away from souls like a week after my first try, then loved it afterwards
[0:34:32] <%FacetiousAF> do not give up, skeleton
[0:34:33] <$Sphincter_Spelunker> gambare skeleton
[0:34:33] <TurtlesAndTentacles> Crepes are pretentious lol. eat a hardworking pancake
[0:34:38] <peachy996> Do It.
[0:34:52] <%Jackgar> I think the fluffiness of pancakes are not to be underestimated
[0:35:08] <peachy996> If I had HAD to eat a breakfast, I guess Pancake.
[0:35:12] <$Sphincter_Spelunker> but you can roll a crepe and make it savory
[0:35:12] <leinadtonu> East side of the map was brutal for me
[0:35:16] <%VictorVonLouche> Well its just devolved from, guys just learn the mechanics, to git gud because the conversation is with stubborn people that wants a letsplay difficulty game basically.
[0:35:17] <%cade_calrayn> My boyfriend is the same way, Paige, lol. He can't handle a conversation while also doing something else
[0:35:18] <@CreepyPorpoise> dude, for real.
[0:35:22] <%AncelDeLambert> gawd Paige play the game how I tell you now hit the thing scrub
[0:35:23] <TurtlesAndTentacles> you know I watch people like you and Pat and I have no idea how I'm ever gonna beat the enemies you guys have.
[0:35:23] <%FacetiousAF> BRO HOW DID YOU NOT DODGE THAT E.Z.
[0:35:27] <%Jackgar> The east side seems to be meant for higher levels than the west side
[0:35:34] <+coward_man> Pancakes are infinitely better than Waffles, but I've only had potato waffles
[0:35:35] <CurrySauseBandit> The whole point of the Souls series is persevere in the face of adversity by trying again and again. People that talk down on people in these games for being "bad" are scum.
[0:35:37] <peachy996> A bad pancake is better than a good waffle lmao
[0:35:38] <%TheMoenia> TheMoenia subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 16 months! YAY
[0:35:47] <%AncelDeLambert> LUL
[0:35:48] <+Nekros4442> DoNt RoLl tWICE JUst roLl oNCE
[0:35:49] <%Jackgar> Maybe the whole OH GOD EVERYTHING IS RED AND HORRIBLE element of it is kind of a sign there
[0:35:59] <bundle_of_herbs> oh god that'S horrible
[0:35:59] <+ReefTheWizard> bad at game = bad at life
[0:36:02] <@CreepyPorpoise> there are definitely some highly toxic elements to the community
[0:36:02] <+imthewisejanitor> "You think I came out the pussy drawing Mozart??"
[0:36:06] <TurtlesAndTentacles> @peachy996 You dissing Waffles,my dood?!
[0:36:06] <%TheMoenia> some people need to seriously touch some grass
[0:36:06] <+coward_man> touch grass for real
[0:36:07] <%cade_calrayn> go touch actual grace, people
[0:36:10] <+ReefTheWizard> fucking nerds
[0:36:15] <$SinisterBroccoli> why do you hate crepes Paige?
[0:36:15] <orpleborple> crazy people
[0:36:17] <secret_npc> this is my first From game, and I've deduced that fans of these games are awful and have the worst senses of humor
[0:36:17] <+ccwettr123> the real subhumans are people that are cruel to people playing videogames wrong
[0:36:22] <%king_wragles> Ya, the person being told that should hide their face! Kappa
[0:36:23] <+ccwettr123> 'wrong'
[0:36:26] <peachy996> @TurtlesAndTentacles Give me a platform and I'll diss Breakfast as a whole
[0:36:27] <djblue_shift> @peachy996 thems fightin words
[0:36:27] <$Sphincter_Spelunker> @imthewisejanitor a good Arin-ism for once
[0:36:33] <@CreepyPorpoise> people get mad if you don't struggle enough to beat the thing they struggled to beat creepy49Porpkek
[0:36:35] <%AncelDeLambert> Be wary of sniper
[0:36:37] <%king_wragles> Twitter is awful
[0:36:38] <%Jackgar> So Hollowing is basically a metaphor in Dark Souls. The moment you give up is when you've hollowed out. Just like the Crestfallen warrior
[0:36:44] <+D00msDayDan> that's the sound they make too
[0:36:45] <%Sotetsu> Uuuuuh
[0:36:48] <Spydurman> that's how you weed out who to block
[0:36:50] <%Jackgar> As long as you keep fighting you haven't hollowed out
[0:36:52] <peachy996> I hate breakfast. The concept of Breakfast for Dinner disgusts me
[0:37:03] <TurtlesAndTentacles> @peachy996 You dissing Breakfast as a whole!? oh hell no. it's time for war
[0:37:13] <%Jackgar> Hot take: Waffles Good
[0:37:17] <TurtlesAndTentacles> BRINNER IS THE CORNER STONE FEAST OF CHAMPIONS
[0:37:18] <peachy996> To War!
[0:37:18] <+ReefTheWizard> @Jackgar the darksouls hollowing / depression themes sold me on it
[0:37:23] <+shootbang_exe> haven't been watching a ton since I'm playing on my own but what would you say the weirdest or coolest thing you've found so far is?
[0:37:26] <+imthewisejanitor> She said she'd give us her tips. KappaHD
[0:37:26] <djblue_shift> Oh wise peach, grant us your infinite wisdom
[0:37:29] <%cade_calrayn> I genuninely mean this, Paige, I think you're a good source of advice on how to get into Souls and how to handle the challenges; you may not have the technical advice but you give good advice
[0:37:30] <+coward_man> Babble away Paige, love hearing you talk about things!
[0:37:32] <$Sphincter_Spelunker> @peachy996 every meal after you wake up is breakfast. you're "breaking" the "fast" from the night before
[0:37:33] <%king_wragles> Alright I'm gonna swing on the next person to say 'brinner'
[0:37:40] <%Sotetsu> Did bad man die?
[0:37:46] <%Sotetsu> Yep
[0:37:47] <%AncelDeLambert> got da sword huh?
[0:37:54] <%Sotetsu> Sword sword
[0:37:56] <+coward_man> yeyeye the George sword
[0:37:58] <%EdgySalad> Hi Paige! <3 I made it for a streaaam
[0:37:59] <SubscribensteinsMonster> A sword made of lesser swords
[0:38:01] <+MartinOfLoxley> creepy49Porpkek
[0:38:03] <%AncelDeLambert> deathe by pointy
[0:38:05] <cartakus> such a ugly sword
[0:38:13] <%Sotetsu> That is such a good charm.
[0:38:14] <%Jackgar> That Grafted Greatsword is SUPER cool. But alas, I'm a Dex/Faith build so no shot I'm going to be wielding that anytime soon
[0:38:17] <+coward_man> I hit that last night Paige! it scared the shit out of me
[0:38:17] <iosephe> oh nice
[0:38:18] <+imthewisejanitor> @Sphincter_Spelunker They're increasingly rare, but they're out there.
[0:38:21] <%cade_calrayn> That one's great!
[0:38:28] <%Jackgar> When I picked it up I was like "Damn, bro"
[0:38:28] <peachy996> @Sphincter_Spelunker Okay. Breakfast still sucks though
[0:38:34] <%king_wragles> I'm just running with the Havel's and the FAP equivelants cause I'm boring and lame at parties
[0:38:35] <%Jackgar> The Scarseal is AWESOME
[0:38:38] <scrumbotime> I love the scar and soreseal
[0:38:44] <%cade_calrayn> It's an 8.5% damage increase
[0:38:44] <%Jackgar> Trust me it's a worthwhile tradeoff
[0:38:47] <scrumbotime> +3 to 4 diff stats
[0:38:47] <%cade_calrayn> It's a solid buff
[0:38:49] <%AncelDeLambert> sounds bad
[0:38:52] <$Sphincter_Spelunker> atpCap
[0:38:52] <+MartinOfLoxley> creepy49Hmm
[0:38:54] <+Nekros4442> its like 10 levels in 1 talisman
[0:39:01] <peachy996> Bacon is alright but better used in other stuff like a sandwhich
[0:39:09] <bundle_of_herbs> makes big and strong but you get the curse of stub your toes
[0:39:12] <scrumbotime> take more damage, but heal it, genius
[0:39:14] <%cade_calrayn> This is also a game that *demands* you pump Vitality, though, Paige
[0:39:20] <secret_npc> are you trying to kill or trying to survive?
[0:39:23] <%AncelDeLambert> jellyfish are fren
[0:39:26] <%Jackgar> Look how much more health you have now
[0:39:26] <%cade_calrayn> Like you *have* to in order to survive
[0:39:46] <peachy996> You wanted to go to a cave I think?
[0:39:48] <%cade_calrayn> I have ~1000 HP and Radahn one-shot me frequently before I got him
[0:39:50] <%Jackgar> There is another item that's the same but with the mental stats and that is also amazing
[0:40:00] <bundle_of_herbs> the primal urge to dump 30 levels into strength
[0:40:05] <%Sotetsu> I'd love to see you do the main quest in the castle. fmgJAHN
[0:40:06] <%cade_calrayn> That gaol is where Blaidd is, the one you had your cursor on
[0:40:07] <+ReefTheWizard> VIT is a crutch, HP is a crutch, glass cannon build.
[0:40:17] <$Sphincter_Spelunker> grind up some runes, cuz fuck it
[0:40:23] <+ReefTheWizard> @cade_calrayn confirming my thoughts
[0:40:24] <%MooseIsGoose> @cade_calrayn Same thing happened to me
[0:40:25] <scrumbotime> Hah, Vit is for people who CAN'T cast so many spells you can't see the enemy
[0:40:26] <%cade_calrayn> the southern gaol
[0:40:32] <+shootbang_exe> if I can't dodge or block might as well die
[0:40:32] <%Jackgar> Shields are a crutch, Torrent is a crutch
[0:40:33] <bundle_of_herbs> no need for hp if you don't get hit
[0:40:42] <%AncelDeLambert> hey Paige have you met the bubble people yet?
[0:40:47] <@CreepyPorpoise> Paige glass cannon irl
[0:40:54] <+ReefTheWizard> margit hit so hard that i decided the only way ill beat the game is by hitting hard as the bosses do
[0:40:57] <scrumbotime> Exactly! If you just don't get hit, it isn't bad that you have sub-500 hp
[0:40:58] <SpaceCapnCrone> I always build glass cannon and always regret it
[0:41:04] <cartakus> 30 points in Vit and still not enough
[0:41:17] <%Jackgar> See? Damage increase isn't that bad
[0:41:20] <MaritimeSpanker> OH BIG DOOT
[0:41:26] <%cade_calrayn> Have you fought Godrick yet? I don't remember
[0:41:27] <scrumbotime> just pump int to 58 and go ham with lasers
[0:41:31] <+ReefTheWizard> dragon communion incantations are a game changer
[0:41:41] <peachy996> Love those Twerking Trees
[0:41:41] <%Jackgar> Dragon incantations are SO fun
[0:41:49] <%Jackgar> But you have to invest in Arcane for it
[0:41:50] <MaritimeSpanker> How're you liking that big sword, by the by? It doing the big unga damage?
[0:41:52] <%cade_calrayn> SAME
[0:41:56] <+ReefTheWizard> paige you should take out the tree sentinel in the starting zone
[0:42:00] <BlueSpartan119> YEP
[0:42:03] <iosephe> mhm
[0:42:07] <scrumbotime> I've put 60 hours in, so i'm, taking a break. For the night.
[0:42:09] <%Jackgar> I'm like level 60 and have only done two of the demigod bosses
[0:42:16] <+ReefTheWizard> play enough elden ring and youll be dreaming of maidens
[0:42:31] <%camofbeans_> working this week has been absolute hell, I can't get anything done bc of elden ring
[0:42:32] <PenguinPall> I play until I am tired and hate the game, then I can't stop waiting to play it again
[0:42:32] <djblue_shift> I don‚Äôt even have it and i@ thinking about it
[0:42:34] <sleepystardewfarmer> yeah
[0:42:42] <+vehementvadr> tree sentinel implies grass sentinel
[0:42:46] <+ReefTheWizard> tree sentinel iseasy, approach on horseback, jump off and stay extremely close
[0:42:54] <%Jackgar> And somehow I still haven't fought this guy!
[0:42:56] <$hewlettfan96> How do I stop my cat from being so gaseous?? It‚Äôs disgusting and makes me want to puke! psaWrong
[0:43:07] <%Jackgar> I didn't even realize he was there, and I've fought 3 or 4 evergaol dudes already
[0:43:13] <MaritimeSpanker> @PeachSaliva why not give wielding two big swords at the same time a go?
[0:43:14] <modsformeandyou> Has anyone been watching Patrick Boivin's Elden Ring streams? I have a question about them which I need answered
[0:43:16] <@CreepyPorpoise> haha
[0:43:17] <%FacetiousAF> that's a WHOLE ASS DUDE
[0:43:23] <%Jackgar> This guy is even MORE Big and Strong
[0:43:27] <%Sotetsu> You can do it, skeleton
[0:43:27] <@CreepyPorpoise> thats a large lad
[0:43:27] <+ReefTheWizard> have you considered moving your potions to the y button menu so that you can one button call the horse?
[0:43:28] <$hewlettfan96> This guys strong whooooz
[0:43:30] <SpaceCapnCrone> parrying works on this dude if you're feeling spicy
[0:43:31] <%ceremight> Oh THIS GUY.
[0:43:33] <MaritimeSpanker> It makes the damage output increase
[0:43:34] <cartakus> Crucible is train with damage but very limited moves
[0:43:39] <%Jackgar> Might want to come back when your own Big and Strongness is higher up
[0:43:45] <$hewlettfan96> Bullshit cheap enemies
[0:43:46] <sirrice77> two swords is double the investment on upgrades
[0:43:54] <$Sphincter_Spelunker> say Maidens instead
[0:44:00] <marvel877> Paige is not a size queen.
[0:44:03] <%Jackgar> Two swords works great for scythes because dear lord the bleed buildup
[0:44:04] <%tentavision> i think you're more of a one big stick girl (good night everybody)
[0:44:06] <killr0ckstars> no ladies?
[0:44:06] <peachy996> Oh that's a comedian's routine. I forget ho
[0:44:09] <peachy996> *who
[0:44:10] <%Jackgar> But I don't know how viable it is on strength weapons
[0:44:14] <+ReefTheWizard> @sirrice77 yeah plus dual halberds looks way cooler
[0:44:14] <Ipsenscastle> what lvl is Paige atm?
[0:44:18] <peachy996> They also like adding Ladies onto everything
[0:44:19] <$hewlettfan96> I wish more girls went for short guys like you Paige
[0:44:28] <+wizard_of_diamonds> I doubt any of us care as long as you're having fun
[0:44:29] <sleepystardewfarmer> is there a way to fight the bosses again after you've defeated them?
[0:44:53] <%Jackgar> There is some fun stuff to be found in that area of the map
[0:45:04] <%tentavision> pat has it good cuz for him ALL GIRLS are tall girls
[0:45:04] <%Sotetsu> That's pretty high fmgPRAMS
[0:45:08] <%Jackgar> But Miyazaki's swamp fetish showing itself again
[0:45:12] <secret_npc> ladies
[0:45:15] <$hewlettfan96> Is that high I have no idea??
[0:45:19] <%Jackgar> Look how much damage that dude isn't doing to you
[0:45:20] <+ReefTheWizard> just run past him
[0:45:22] <scrumbotime> Finally, we found the jingle horse that needs to giddy up
[0:45:23] <$hewlettfan96> What‚Äôs the max level
[0:45:24] <+ReefTheWizard> its not worth it
[0:45:31] <%tentavision> STOMPED
[0:45:42] <+ReefTheWizard> big risk, no reward
[0:45:43] <secret_npc> this is a horse fight
[0:45:44] <SpaceCapnCrone> what be this ding-dongery!?
[0:45:51] <modsformeandyou> Has Paige been to bug nest?
[0:45:52] <+Kevlar_Caviar> haven't been watching these streams because of how many elden ring playthroughs i need to catch up with, how far is she compared to pat?
[0:45:56] <%Jackgar> Fun fact: The Ding Dongs were a pro wrestling tag team. They were very annoying
[0:45:56] <+Naacat> Any tips for beginners?

[0:47:31] <%Jackgar> "What the fuck is that, Jesus" is a common reaction to seeing a new enemy in this game

[0:48:52] <$hewlettfan96> Paige are you Teh gay?
[0:48:52] <Ipsenscastle> I shook too much and now my ass and tits have swapped places, why did I follow Paige's advice
[0:48:53] <%Lunarclock> Actually you're on your E game, which stands for Elden Ring (or so I'm told)
[0:49:00] <+imthewisejanitor> Togay is certainly a gay.
[0:49:01] <$Sphincter_Spelunker> yesterbi
[0:49:08] <scrumbotime> Hello on this gay is what my cat is saying when he jumps on me and meows
[0:49:11] <%CptCreampuff16> did she skip storm castle?
[0:49:11] <%SveriSageAdvice> does that mean your gaydar is broken today?
[0:49:12] <%Jackgar> Do you find the golden wisps to be helpful for you?
[0:49:17] <+imthewisejanitor> Tomorrowmo?
[0:49:20] <+ReefTheWizard> "sneak:
[0:49:22] <%king_wragles> you should murder everything in here
[0:49:30] <+vehementvadr> tomorrian
[0:49:31] <$hewlettfan96> Yestergay
[0:49:48] <$hewlettfan96> What a creepy cave
[0:49:51] <scrumbotime> ah yes, the gay wrist move
[0:49:56] <%king_wragles> They recognize each other by scent and wrist motions
[0:49:56] <TurtlesAndTentacles> How about Stacy's Mom. That's a good song
[0:49:58] <%Jackgar> Is there a hand motion for eating a clam?
[0:50:01] <%kyh9> The secret gay handshake
[0:50:07] <scrumbotime> haha leaf
[0:50:13] <+imthewisejanitor> And...and then everyone scissors...?
[0:50:20] <$hewlettfan96> Does it work the  same for bisexuals?
[0:50:22] <SpaceCapnCrone> damn, he blew it.
[0:50:23] <Ipsenscastle> Arteria Leaf is the true villain of Elden Ring
[0:50:30] <Psyramics> yeah, its the v hand sign
[0:50:30] <+vehementvadr> on the eve of yesterday morning
[0:50:33] <scrumbotime> @Jackgar That's where you make a V with your fingers and put it to your mouth
[0:50:35] <+Naacat> @sphincter_spelunker Ooh thank u, will do!
[0:50:40] <heartlesshealer> Are they... y'know? Non-allergic to shellfish?
[0:50:41] <%AncelDeLambert> side of mouth smirk and eyebrow raise
[0:50:44] <$hewlettfan96> @imthewisejanitor What‚Äôs ‚Äòscissoring‚Äô
[0:50:44] <%Jackgar> It would be the gay lady equivalent of doing the cheek push thing with your tongue
[0:50:56] <+ReefTheWizard> @Jackgar the same hand motion as opening a big door in souls
[0:50:58] <%Jackgar> @scrumbotime Oh that's true! The V-tongue thing, of course
[0:51:00] <scrumbotime> MONKEY
[0:51:05] <%kyh9> Jump heavy is by far more useful than blocking
[0:51:19] <%AncelDeLambert> oh THIS cave
[0:51:31] <%FacetiousAF> do you like the horsey combat?
[0:51:34] <%kyh9> Jump Heavy just mogs every other ability in the game
[0:51:34] <$hewlettfan96> Is this a hard part of the game?
[0:51:37] <%AncelDeLambert> have fun
[0:51:39] <%Jackgar> I actually didn't find this cave. So I guess I'm spoiling myself but whatever
[0:51:42] <heartlesshealer> Enjoy
[0:51:44] <%cade_calrayn> Everyone has a bad experience with *some* cave, Paige
[0:51:44] <%kyh9> Hey, they put it into the game for you to use
[0:51:54] <%Jackgar> This is the kind of game where it's actually cool to see other people finding stuff you didn't
[0:51:54] <%kyh9> And magic losers dont get to enjoy it, all the more reason to use it
[0:51:56] <%cade_calrayn> they're all different and all sucky in a different way
[0:52:03] <$hewlettfan96> Why do you move so sluggishly in all the souls games?
[0:52:05] <$Sphincter_Spelunker> stronguh
[0:52:09] <%FacetiousAF> fuck yea status stacks
[0:52:13] <%FacetiousAF> lets goooooo
[0:52:13] <%kyh9> Faith/intelligence users need not apply
[0:52:16] <%king_wragles> Wait till you can combo frostbite and bleed together
[0:52:16] <%Jackgar> The big-brain strat is to be a faith-based caster/melee hybrid
[0:52:16] <%kyh9> Stronguh
[0:52:20] <+imthewisejanitor> Stroooonguh
[0:52:25] <Sunstalker> I think Bleed+Frostbite would be a really strong combo too. Both are just big hp gauges
[0:52:25] <%FacetiousAF> @kyh9 sounds like the talk of a long-haired freaky person
[0:52:26] <scrumbotime> Just powerstance Moonveils
[0:52:27] <+Blackmage9999> psaGiefstare
[0:52:29] <%AncelDeLambert> yep, it's this cave. Try Down
[0:52:33] <%Jackgar> So you can use the faith scythes for melee but have spells
[0:52:42] <+ReefTheWizard> get your F 's ready boiz
[0:52:42] <TheAntiNihilist> ...no duh. three of any debuffs is strong
[0:52:43] <%kyh9> @kyh9 Get over here so I can Jump+Heavy you
[0:52:43] <$hewlettfan96> It honestly blows me away you somehow completed both 3 and Bloodborne, the stars must have aligned for you
[0:52:58] <%kyh9> What modest poise you have, woul dbe a shame if something happened to it
[0:53:03] <$hewlettfan96> Jeesus this guys hard
[0:53:14] <+ReefTheWizard> regular enemy lmao
[0:53:19] <+storebrandcandy> wasn't that guy a boss in another starting cave
[0:53:19] <$Sphincter_Spelunker> hell yeah block with your face
[0:53:20] <technicstars> TREASURE?
[0:53:41] <%AncelDeLambert> I have yet to find a mimic
[0:53:45] <$hewlettfan96> @reefthewizard Oh god he‚Äôs a regular enemy
[0:53:53] <technicstars> How many hours have you been playing so far?
[0:53:59] <%AncelDeLambert> you are not done
[0:54:08] <$hewlettfan96> How long is this game compared to the other souls?
[0:54:10] <heartlesshealer> hmm
[0:54:12] <+vehementvadr> why did my brain interpret the spear talisman as spear NFT?
[0:54:14] <%AncelDeLambert> well, you're dine in that room
[0:54:15] <+ReefTheWizard> @hewlettfan96 power scaling goes from the weakest in soulsbourne to the hardest
[0:54:16] <+imthewisejanitor> Ye
[0:54:28] <DoctorMulholland> Long as SHIT that's how long
[0:54:32] <%cade_calrayn> The way to the capital opens after 2, yes
[0:54:34] <%Jackgar> Yeah you only need to get 2 runes, but I mean....that's lame
[0:54:40] <%Jackgar> You gotta kill EVERYONE
[0:54:46] <%VictorVonLouche> Ye, the other ones become increasingly more bulshit to fight lol
[0:54:54] <%Jackgar> I've heard there are over 80 bosses in this game that you can fight
[0:54:57] <%AncelDeLambert> get your rainbow stones oit
[0:55:10] <%Jackgar> Including all the bosses of the micro dungeons
[0:55:31] <doster504> I'm at 92 hours and I just found a new area again lol
[0:55:38] <scrumbotime> i love that crafting means you will never not have prism stones
[0:55:39] <$hewlettfan96> @reefthewizard Yes of course, but what are the ‚Äòhard‚Äô enemies, comparatively speaking, since the series  general high level of difficulty
[0:55:53] <%FacetiousAF> gross how dare you enjoy things on the itnernet
[0:55:54] <Monkeyweed21> theres so much
[0:55:57] <%FacetiousAF> itner
[0:55:58] <@CreepyPorpoise> I feel it
[0:55:59] <%Jackgar> I keep forgetting crafting even exists even though I'm constantly picking up materials
[0:56:03] <+3d_pbandj> but how do you really feel?
[0:56:05] <%FacetiousAF> we like the babble
[0:56:09] <%Lunarclock> Don't apologize for streaming a game you're enjoying :D
[0:56:11] <Monkeyweed21> Literally everywhere and every build theres something cool
[0:56:16] <+imthewisejanitor> Look at the nerd, loving things. What a nerd.
[0:56:21] <%Nordguy> thank you for babble
[0:56:31] <@CreepyPorpoise> I do not like JUMPING SNAIL
[0:56:32] <jetpack_rorschasch> That‚Äôs why we‚Äôre here! SeemsGood
[0:56:34] <%kyh9> SNAIL
[0:56:37] <+storebrandcandy> pretty fast for a snail
[0:56:37] <%kyh9> IT WAS YOU, ALL ALONG
[0:56:38] <$Sphincter_Spelunker> dog
[0:56:44] <+vehementvadr> it's ok Paige, if I streamed I'd sniffle every 12 seconds, I'd take this any day
[0:56:45] <+ReefTheWizard> @hewlettfan96 when  youre on foot and encounter a goup of enemies it would be a good idea to size them up, its usually pretty obvious, and if not at first glance it will be when they start attacking
[0:56:58] <%FacetiousAF> more like ancel de lambast
[0:56:59] <DancesWitBalrog> Page's Great Rune isn't equipped?
[0:57:01] <%AncelDeLambert> hey that me
[0:57:04] <DancesWitBalrog> Paige
[0:57:09] <%AncelDeLambert> KNIVES RULE
[0:57:11] <Nitsuj293> Knives are good
[0:57:18] <+imthewisejanitor> Ansel Elgort was here??
[0:57:21] <Nitsuj293> much better then the other games
[0:57:27] <%cade_calrayn> Wait, have you beaten Godrick?
[0:57:33] <%cade_calrayn> If so, you have a Great Rune
[0:57:34] <%AncelDeLambert> does she have one?
[0:57:36] <Monkeyweed21> yea thrown objects now scale with stats and you can always craft more of them
[0:57:42] <DancesWitBalrog> ohhhh
[0:57:43] <%cade_calrayn> Okay you're good!
[0:57:45] <%Jackgar> Thank god they finally changed that
[0:57:50] <DancesWitBalrog> nvm me then
[0:57:50] <+ReefTheWizard> im high as shit were you askign how to tell what enemies are hard?
[0:57:52] <%AncelDeLambert> you're fine then
[0:57:57] <@CreepyPorpoise> haha
[0:58:01] <%AncelDeLambert> LUL
[0:58:02] <@CreepyPorpoise> holy shit
[0:58:03] <%cade_calrayn> Doing so gives you an item that boosts all your stats
[0:58:18] <DancesWitBalrog> lucky
[0:58:20] <+ReefTheWizard> @Monkeyweed21 crafting firepots was all i ever needed
[0:58:23] <@CreepyPorpoise> that was so close to being the end
[0:58:24] <%AncelDeLambert> I guess she doesn't need the rocks
[0:58:34] <+ReefTheWizard> steez
[0:58:35] <%AncelDeLambert> she's not int after all
[0:58:36] <+vehementvadr> has Paige beaten Cha Oak yet?
[0:58:37] <Monkeyweed21> @ReefTheWizard status darts are also kino
[0:58:45] <DancesWitBalrog> excuse me, STYLE
[0:58:53] <leinadtonu> First time an enemy chased me up a ladder I almost stream.
[0:58:56] <+ReefTheWizard> @Monkeyweed21 theres so much stuff
[0:58:59] <sleepystardewfarmer> the buzz lightyear approach
[0:58:59] <%AncelDeLambert> I wish I had more than poison daggers in my crafts
[0:59:11] <+ReefTheWizard> be wary of snail
[0:59:14] <@CreepyPorpoise> Ah, the bad man
[0:59:16] <%AncelDeLambert> BOSS TIME
[0:59:16] <%Jackgar> You could always spam the lock-on button if you suspect an enemy might be around
[0:59:23] <%Jackgar> Oh hey it's one of these guys
[0:59:23] <%FingaLights> That skelly wanted a fist bump :(
[0:59:27] <%AncelDeLambert> hate this guy
[0:59:31] <+ReefTheWizard> thats a lot of hp you took off, you got this guy
[0:59:32] <heartlesshealer> at least you got all those items
[0:59:35] <%cade_calrayn> Paige possesses a great deal of skill and luck, she just lacks any sense of direction and sometimes the ability to put any of those skills to use properly
[0:59:36] <%AncelDeLambert> HATE this guy
[0:59:38] <+storebrandcandy> would you like a boss before your boss
[0:59:41] <$Sphincter_Spelunker> oh, I didn't know that version was here
[0:59:49] <%Jackgar> I mean he's fast but he doesn't have a ton of health
[0:59:51] <%AncelDeLambert> hate him here, haye him in the Gaol
[0:59:52] <DancesWitBalrog> I think you send a message. that's all that counts
[0:59:56] <%Jackgar> One hit took a big chunk off
[0:59:57] <%SveriSageAdvice> he's more of a pushover than other bosses in the area
[0:59:59] <jetpack_rorschasch> Speaking of style‚Ä¶
[1:00:00] <+ReefTheWizard> give it another shot at least, now that youve seen what he does
[1:00:33] <+ReefTheWizard> always go for two attempts at least if its easy enough to get two
[1:00:43] <+ReefTheWizard> you never know if the first death just sucked
[1:00:44] <%AncelDeLambert> I grabbed some gold runes to beat him, fukim
[1:00:45] <%Jackgar> There's this one boss type that is SUPER fast and hard to hit but dies in like 2 or 3 hits. But it can kill you QUICK. And I don't mean this guy
[1:01:00] <+vehementvadr> I enjoy your race car noises
[1:01:01] <%pinkslimegoblin> hit him
[1:01:05] <%Jackgar> Blocking is good
[1:01:06] <DancesWitBalrog> I love that they added the Bloodborne lantern. it was lowkey one of my favorite items in that game
[1:01:11] <%FingaLights> dont be spooked
[1:01:13] <+ReefTheWizard> dont get hit, put the pointy bit of the sword inside him
[1:01:16] <%AncelDeLambert> yeah, be patient, he sticks to you
[1:01:19] <jetpack_rorschasch> Spoooky man
[1:01:25] <%cade_calrayn> Yooooo!
[1:01:28] <%Jackgar> See, look how much damage you did
[1:01:32] <cartakus> oh I did not find this one
[1:01:39] <%cade_calrayn> You are indeed Big and Strong
[1:01:42] <cartakus> where is it?
[1:01:48] <%AncelDeLambert> Paige needs some heavier ash
[1:01:55] <jetpack_rorschasch> Don‚Äôt forget the crust when they‚Äôre staggered Paige
[1:01:57] <+ReefTheWizard> block him
[1:01:59] <+ReefTheWizard> you got this\
[1:02:03] <DancesWitBalrog> YOOO
[1:02:14] <+ReefTheWizard> barely any stamina damage on his attack
[1:02:17] <DancesWitBalrog> "Nothing personal, kid"
[1:02:20] <+faytthepally> literally *teleports behind you*
[1:02:31] <+ReefTheWizard> dude you HAVE THIS
[1:02:33] <$Sphincter_Spelunker> 2 swings Paige, no mashy
[1:02:33] <+ReefTheWizard> EZ CLAP
[1:02:37] <+ReefTheWizard> thirsd try
[1:02:37] <%SveriSageAdvice> you got his ass
[1:02:38] <%Jackgar> See how big the damage was?
[1:02:39] <@CreepyPorpoise> very close
[1:02:41] <%FingaLights> NotLikeThis
[1:02:42] <%AncelDeLambert> I hate how face-fuck he is
[1:02:43] <%CptCreampuff16> press r2 after he bounces off your shield
[1:02:48] <%FingaLights> So close
[1:02:54] <%cade_calrayn> She was excited by the Bloodborne similarities
[1:02:55] <%Jackgar> Just stay in his ass and don't leet him do the zip arounds and you're good
[1:02:55] <+StromkoPenguin> FromSoft: "Players seem to like to back off and heal, what if bosses, no, enemies in general just didn't stop hitting you?"
[1:02:56] <+ReefTheWizard> dying is fun
[1:03:00] <%cade_calrayn> since that's just a Bloodborne right there
[1:03:04] <Nitsuj293> now crush his head coxJam
[1:03:04] <+vehementvadr> he has a lightning McQueen race car bed, the secret to his speed
[1:03:07] <%AncelDeLambert> Paige do you have an ash chunkier than the jellyfish?
[1:03:13] <%Jackgar> Guard counters are SUPER good against this type of dude
[1:03:19] <%SveriSageAdvice> he super hates it when you circle around to the left ive noticed lol
[1:03:29] <+ReefTheWizard> jellyfish is a god but his attacks do bleed
[1:03:32] <+ReefTheWizard> try wolvews
[1:03:36] <+stickygumbolee> need to get yourself an Oleg
[1:03:37] <%Jackgar> You can jump his horizontal swipes
[1:03:41] <+ReefTheWizard> skeletons
[1:03:43] <+FattimusSlime> An ass chunkier than jellyfish?  What is going on in this game?
[1:03:44] <+ReefTheWizard> dop skellys
[1:03:45] <%AncelDeLambert> use skeleton
[1:03:45] <%cade_calrayn> Have you unlocked the ability to upgrade your summons, Paige?
[1:03:47] <+ReefTheWizard> skellys fuck
[1:03:53] <+EdHeng> 3 wolfies help a lot
[1:03:53] <+shootbang_exe> yeah oleg owns
[1:03:54] <Nitsuj293> yeah a multi ash would be nice
[1:03:55] <Godrowkil> There is a way to improve your ashes too
[1:03:55] <jetpack_rorschasch> Don‚Äôt forget when they‚Äôre staggered, you can get the crit Paige.
[1:03:57] <%cade_calrayn> You have to do the quest for the red-hooded girl at Stormhill Shack
[1:03:58] <%FingaLights> Oh Paige, where is your grind spot?
[1:04:04] <%CptCreampuff16> do the skellys they respawn
[1:04:13] <%Jackgar> I'm SHOCKED you aren't using skeletons constantly. Just because of....you know....YOU.
[1:04:16] <%cade_calrayn> @FingaLights Greyoll Dragonbarrow's far eastern corner
[1:04:18] <Ipsenscastle> Oleg takes way too much FP for Paige to ever summon
[1:04:19] <Godrowkil> Uh
[1:04:36] <%CptCreampuff16> not big enough yet
[1:04:41] <%cade_calrayn> Oh good, you've unlocked upgrades?
[1:04:46] <%FingaLights> @cade_calrayn Thanks!
[1:04:52] <DancesWitBalrog> The skeletons are your loyal subjects tho
[1:04:54] <+ReefTheWizard> you just need distractions on this fight, not big tough boys, but either doggos or skellys should work here
[1:05:05] <+ReefTheWizard> never give up
[1:05:07] <jetpack_rorschasch> Skeley boys might be helpful.
[1:05:09] <%Jackgar> Yeah wolves might be better
[1:05:21] <Nitsuj293> I always was drawn to any ashes with range
[1:05:23] <+ReefTheWizard> oh you did tree setinel
[1:05:26] <+ReefTheWizard> cool
[1:05:28] <%cade_calrayn> Tree Sentinel
[1:05:31] <%cade_calrayn> they're... fun
[1:05:32] <%Jackgar> THe golden halberd is so cool
[1:05:34] <%king_wragles> That's a swing and slash halberd btw
[1:05:48] <DancesWitBalrog> Tree Sentinel is harder than Godrick imo.
[1:05:51] <+ReefTheWizard> big halbred fucks HARD btw
[1:06:12] <+ReefTheWizard> wtf skeletons
[1:06:16] <Nitsuj293> Tree Sentinel is easy as hell LUL
[1:06:18] <DracaenaLeaf> LUL
[1:06:26] <cartakus> what is the name of this place again?
[1:06:26] <$Sphincter_Spelunker> don't be mad at them, they don't have brains
[1:06:33] <+ReefTheWizard> okay, lets run that one back
[1:06:38] <DancesWitBalrog> bad RNG, you got this
[1:06:40] <%AncelDeLambert> oh god they're fighting the snails
[1:06:42] <%Jackgar> I guess they got distracted by the slugs?
[1:06:50] <+StromkoPenguin> The Pit of Bordt of the Voreal Valley
[1:06:52] <jetpack_rorschasch> Sorry‚Ä¶
[1:06:53] <%AncelDeLambert> mulligan
[1:06:56] <cartakus> Thank you!
[1:07:01] <+ReefTheWizard> couple of BONEHEADS
[1:07:01] <+barrakuta371> I looked away for a bit. What happened?
[1:07:05] <+imthewisejanitor> Pretend what didn't happen? KappaHD
[1:07:06] <gabgano> What a couple of bone heads üíÄ
[1:07:15] <%CptCreampuff16> this guy is easy to guard counter with your stats wait for the last hit of his combo
[1:07:16] <%Jackgar> I should go clear this spot out later. I've cleared out everything else around it but missed this spot
[1:07:18] <+ReefTheWizard> @gabgano damn bro
[1:07:20] <$Sphincter_Spelunker> Zoro says nothing happened
[1:07:26] <%AncelDeLambert> Paige summoned skelly, skelly fought fog wall
[1:07:36] <gabgano> @reefthewizard aaaay
[1:07:48] <%Jackgar> Did you see the spot in the roundtable with all the bloodstains?
[1:07:52] <jetpack_rorschasch> Them bones them bones need, upgrading!
[1:08:05] <+ReefTheWizard> @gabgano skeleton hivemind
[1:08:14] <%Jackgar> You probably have run items
[1:08:17] <%Jackgar> rune*
[1:08:24] <%CptCreampuff16> soul items?
[1:08:26] <+StromkoPenguin> So Elden Ring seems to focus even harder on armored knights and Arthurian legend and stuff: is Poise still nerfed into the ground?
[1:08:32] <%Jackgar> So my OCD makes it so I can never use my last of any type of golden rune
[1:08:41] <%AncelDeLambert> wait I thought she died. What was that red hood, then?
[1:08:49] <%Jackgar> So I have like a level 8 golden rune just sitting in my inventory because I always have to have one left
[1:08:53] <%cade_calrayn> Jellyfish is your favorite
[1:08:55] <%AncelDeLambert> DOGS
[1:08:57] <%cade_calrayn> Wolves and Jelly are both good
[1:08:58] <Willowight> maybe dogs
[1:08:58] <%Jackgar> Wolves
[1:08:59] <zzNamttamzz> jelly
[1:09:18] <TurtlesAndTentacles> Awoooo
[1:09:19] <%Jackgar> Jelly is way too slow to deal with that quick guy
[1:09:25] <%AncelDeLambert> SHE is a jelly LADY
[1:09:26] <Broand> @AncelDeLambert her friends, who she said were grafted
[1:09:45] <jetpack_rorschasch> You need something to slow his ass down, so maybe the wolfs?
[1:10:10] <DancesWitBalrog> I got a spirit by stumbling into a random catacombs and it's so OP. it's the only one I use now
[1:10:19] <%Fuggins4U> one thing that i find interesting, is that i've been watching a few different people plating this game, i almost never see the same bosses, areas, gear, etc
[1:10:30] <ergulor> right now since is prett early and no ones knows for sure yeah
[1:10:35] <%cade_calrayn> Honestly the worst thing that happens is accidental spoiling
[1:10:51] <DancesWitBalrog> @fuggins4u are you playing too?
[1:10:51] <%king_wragles> I've seen someone who played this for a week straight
[1:10:52] <%Fuggins4U> look, the good bois
[1:10:55] <%cade_calrayn> And yeah, I've been playing parallel to Pat, and every day he finds stuff I've missed, and I've found stuff he's missed
[1:10:57] <ergulor> they're doing the oleg
[1:10:58] <$Sphincter_Spelunker> atpCap
[1:11:01] <%Jackgar> Snails are it again!
[1:11:03] <%Fuggins4U> @DancesWitBalrog not yet, waiting for PC version to be patched
[1:11:03] <%king_wragles> They've only beaten one story boss and found SO MUCH plot
[1:11:05] <%Jackgar> at it*
[1:11:15] <%Fuggins4U> plus i have too many other things to do at the moment
[1:11:22] <Willowight> maybe kill the snails first
[1:11:23] <%king_wragles> Medium settings seem fine now a days, Fuggins
[1:11:26] <sirrice77> If you summon close to the fogwall when enemies chased you there you summons will target them instead of the boss since they're closer
[1:11:28] <+RedMaskBandit> Theyre good dogs!
[1:11:29] <%AncelDeLambert> I think you just have to clear those snails
[1:11:31] <%king_wragles> Still waiting on high settings to actually work
[1:11:38] <DancesWitBalrog> @fuggins4u from DS Fix or FromSoft? I don't have faith in latter to fix it
[1:11:41] <%VentWilsn> these are the most realistic doggos in video game history, just keep barking and pawing at the door
[1:11:46] <%strakillias> Kill the dude out side the door. It's worth an estus if needed to stop that doorway shit
[1:11:46] <%Jackgar> I've been on the ps5 version and when I heard rreports about it I was glad I did
[1:11:46] <jetpack_rorschasch> Oops
[1:12:04] <%king_wragles> It's something with how the game is actually using newer cards
[1:12:10] <%king_wragles> Graphics cards I mean
[1:12:13] <Dreigun> weirdly mine runs better on higher settings. I tried turning it down and my cpu tries to melt
[1:12:17] <%Jackgar> It's a bummer that console and PC can't crossplay in this game
[1:12:22] <%Fuggins4U> aww, i would've loved to see you two coop this, you could've taught him so much
[1:12:23] <DracaenaLeaf> RI- oh nice
[1:12:24] <+StromkoPenguin> People pretty randomly get bad stutters in this, some have been able to fix it with deep config fixes but likely not all.
[1:12:25] <DancesWitBalrog> STYLISH FALL
[1:12:28] <%FingaLights> WOW
[1:12:30] <TurtlesAndTentacles> Pat abandoned you
[1:12:32] <%FingaLights> Fall damage
[1:12:32] <%king_wragles> The problem is that ER doesn't seem to really use the current gen of GPUs?
[1:12:42] <%VentWilsn> LUL
[1:12:50] <DracaenaLeaf> the betrayals
[1:12:51] <Willowight> kill the snails first
[1:12:54] <DancesWitBalrog> @king_wragles it's using the Bloodborne engine, isn't it?
[1:12:55] <%Jackgar> Just kill the snails first
[1:12:57] <$Sphincter_Spelunker> the definition of insanity is what again
[1:13:03] <%king_wragles> @DancesWitBalrog DS3 I thought?
[1:13:10] <TurtlesAndTentacles> that becomes a regular enemy later lol
[1:13:12] <%FacetiousAF> i don't like the idea of a "deep config fix"
[1:13:16] <%Fuggins4U> and i OOP
[1:13:21] <jetpack_rorschasch> Well, I guess the wolves are out then.
[1:13:27] <DancesWitBalrog> @king_wragles DS3 was made on the engine to make BB
[1:13:32] <Broand> I don't know why, heck you managed to fix it one time when you swapped your controller out
[1:13:44] <jetpack_rorschasch> So jelly time?
[1:13:55] <%CptCreampuff16> try guard counters
[1:14:10] <%Jackgar> Nah the wolves would still be good just remove the distraction @jetpack_rorschasch
[1:14:15] <$Sphincter_Spelunker> you show that crystal who's boss
[1:14:17] <Broand> I notice it stutters when I disconnect/reconnect my headphones, so it might be the audio code
[1:14:26] <%rumtumtugnutz> Murderlate the angy floor penises
[1:14:27] <%FingaLights> Falling still gives me anxiety.
[1:14:33] <LVman037> hey page, can you get pat to say "iceswallowcome" out loud
[1:14:33] <%Fuggins4U> u got this, skeleton
[1:14:39] <LVman037> also hi!
[1:14:45] <%Jackgar> Guard counters really mess this guy up. I fought a boss of the same "type" as him elsewhere in the world and guard counters wrecked him
[1:15:07] <DancesWitBalrog> FIGHT BACK. FIGHT BACK
[1:15:11] <halnier> wish I could play more elden ring, but not really feeling up to it with this cold
[1:15:22] <%AncelDeLambert> so... that evergaol is gonna have to wait, clearly
[1:15:27] <DancesWitBalrog> EZ Clap
[1:15:29] <%Fuggins4U> u do it!
[1:15:30] <+gummilol> EZ
[1:15:31] <$Sphincter_Spelunker> good job wolves
[1:15:32] <%Jackgar> As long as you stay in his ass he's not too bad
[1:15:33] <%FingaLights> DED
[1:15:34] <%AncelDeLambert> yayyyy
[1:15:37] <%FingaLights> YOU
[1:15:40] <%FingaLights> DID IT
[1:15:43] <%rumtumtugnutz> You did it!
[1:15:45] <+StromkoPenguin> I love that you beat a feral knight boss by shielding up and letting wolves tear him up.
[1:15:46] <%AncelDeLambert> yaaay, more fp!
[1:15:47] <DancesWitBalrog> nice!
[1:15:48] <peachy996> greceful
[1:15:51] <%Jackgar> Yeah it's a great item
[1:15:52] <peachy996> stolish
[1:15:53] <jetpack_rorschasch> SeemsGood
[1:16:14] <%Fuggins4U> speaking of wolf
[1:16:16] <DancesWitBalrog> is the talisman version of the FAP ring in this game?
[1:16:21] <%AncelDeLambert> and a fren
[1:16:26] <%Fuggins4U> the wolf shack is a little known place
[1:16:27] <%Jackgar> There is a version of this guy that you can't summon against. That was the first time I ran into this boss type, but he dropped an AWESOME weapon.
[1:16:33] <+wizard_of_diamonds> Holy cow. Not only did I find my first illusory wall, the place I'm in is a SMORGASBORD of illusory walls.
[1:16:41] <%AncelDeLambert> she fren be nice
[1:16:46] <Sunstalker> She says you're stinky D:
[1:16:57] <Danitaras> hello Today
[1:17:01] <Sunstalker> Dead
[1:17:04] <sirrice77> Wolf dead
[1:17:06] <Hydrapissed> looks to be dead
[1:17:07] <peachy996> af0xygMoar
[1:17:11] <DancesWitBalrog> All Hearing? the guy with the ear fetish?
[1:17:12] <%SveriSageAdvice> wolf is dead
[1:17:13] <justcallmebobplease> You killed her wolf seems to be the implication, isn't it?
[1:17:16] <Hydrapissed> berserk
[1:17:17] <%AncelDeLambert> withold your antiwoman rage, Paige
[1:17:17] <Hydrapissed> is why
[1:17:18] <Broand> you need a thing
[1:17:18] <%FingaLights> Think you did a murder
[1:17:19] <justcallmebobplease> She talked like you did.
[1:17:20] <jetpack_rorschasch> Wolf be dead
[1:17:21] <ergulor> because baddass wolfs rule
[1:17:22] <%Bloomingzonda> The wold is tired from getting a wolf job
[1:17:25] <%VentWilsn> pour one out for wolvy
[1:17:26] <+imthewisejanitor> Deeply-repressed memories from Wolf's Rain?
[1:17:28] <%Fuggins4U> i did not! oh hi MArk
[1:17:28] <Sunstalker> No, she assumes you're with the people who did
[1:17:29] <Chester_goes_Berserk> george rr martin loves killing wolves
[1:17:30] <%SveriSageAdvice> she is mistaking you for someone else
[1:17:31] <%Nordguy> because it is really sad
[1:17:32] <%FacetiousAF> i did not kill her wolf i did NAAAHHHHT
[1:17:32] <%Jackgar> Have you meet Wolf Boi yet?
[1:17:38] <bassoontyphoon> It‚Äôs a joke reference
[1:17:42] <%MooseIsGoose> There is a site of grace next her
[1:17:43] <bassoontyphoon> Jojo*
[1:17:46] <@CreepyPorpoise> I like him
[1:17:48] <@CreepyPorpoise> wolf boy good
[1:17:51] <+HaloIsA> a good boy
[1:17:52] <+Fetrigon> paaaaiiiiggge
[1:17:56] <peachy996> Blaidd is a good boy
[1:17:57] <jetpack_rorschasch> Because wolves are like dogs, and dogs that die make you sad.
[1:18:01] <%Jackgar> Oh you should totally go fight the guy he wants you to fight
[1:18:01] <DancesWitBalrog> I haven't found wolf boy yet
[1:18:07] <%Bloomingzonda> You have met the guy you have to kill for wolf boy
[1:18:08] <+Fetrigon> creepy49Bonk creepy49Bonk creepy49Bonk creepy49Bonk
[1:18:09] <justcallmebobplease> Wolf boy wants the dude in the Evergaol in the starter zone, near the southern tip.
[1:18:12] <cartakus> he is chill
[1:18:17] <%Jackgar> It's a good reward and his quest line is cool
[1:18:29] <justcallmebobplease> You can summon wolf boy in the fight,  and co-op with wolf boy, it's fun!
[1:18:35] <sirrice77> yes, the npc by the wolf is the important part
[1:18:37] <%king_wragles> There's a wolfman?
[1:18:40] <Broand> it is yep, it's a dead end with a dead friend
[1:18:51] <DancesWitBalrog> @justcallmebobplease that's rad! I need to find him
[1:18:56] <%Jackgar> @king_wragles Yeah you can actually see him in the loading screen
[1:19:06] <%Fuggins4U> horse tricks!
[1:19:20] <%Jackgar> He is probably the most blatant Berserk reference in the game, but he's a nice guy
[1:19:24] <%Jackgar> With a very big sword
[1:19:25] <%Fuggins4U> horse ollies!
[1:19:28] <%Jackgar> And he looks SUPER cool
[1:19:33] <+cvp5127> yeyeye
[1:19:37] <%king_wragles> Well there goes Paige, breaking the game with her horse goat again
[1:19:40] <justcallmebobplease> @DancesWitBalrog Find the wolf man?  There are ruins in the starter zone that have a wolf howl that's oddly not-that-good sounding.  Hear that, talk to merchant in Church of Eilah.  Learn to snap fingers, snap at ruins, meet wolf boy.
[1:20:04] <%Fuggins4U> this can't possibly end well
[1:20:05] <+HaloIsA> this the most skyrim shit
[1:20:10] <jetpack_rorschasch> Goat-horse is doing a great job
[1:20:16] <%SveriSageAdvice> it is
[1:20:24] <DracaenaLeaf> lmao
[1:20:28] <%Jackgar> Yeah then Wolf Boy will you send you on an errand to go fight a guy, and it sets you on an actually super involved chain of side quests
[1:20:34] <DancesWitBalrog> I love that weapon
[1:20:35] <%Jackgar> It's super worth finding him
[1:20:37] <stevenellis386> hey @PeachSaliva and chat
[1:20:45] <MrMoonGoose> Sup!
[1:20:50] <%Jackgar> Yup
[1:20:52] <MrMoonGoose> Paige said, 'Ooh, new friend'
[1:20:55] <jetpack_rorschasch> Oh‚Ä¶
[1:21:02] <DusK_The_Stray> Hi Paige!
[1:21:03] <%SveriSageAdvice> if you head further along the Cliffside outside the entrance of the cave you came through, you can continue wolf lady's stuff
[1:21:04] <OToole42> heyo
[1:21:12] <%VentWilsn> i mean they're basically souls
[1:21:13] <MrMoonGoose> Graceholes
[1:21:19] <OToole42> Hey, calling a spade a spade
[1:21:26] <%CptCreampuff16> yes
[1:21:27] <%SveriSageAdvice> it is a dead end
[1:21:30] <$Sphincter_Spelunker> both
[1:21:33] <Danitaras> i mean they're the same thing
[1:21:34] <stevenellis386> so peach, are you lord of the rings yet?
[1:21:34] <LePipes> dead end
[1:21:36] <MrMoonGoose> @chat What's she tryna do rn?
[1:21:36] <Chester_goes_Berserk> It's dark souls 3 but open world lol
[1:21:37] <+cvp5127> its like coke
[1:21:38] <%CptCreampuff16> its for a later npc quest i thionk
[1:21:39] <%Jackgar> There are a lot of dead ends, and that's okay!
[1:21:42] <DancesWitBalrog> using Bloodborne terminology when playing non Bloodborne games is super appropriate, I think
[1:21:54] <%FacetiousAF> SAAAMMMEEEEE
[1:21:56] <$Sphincter_Spelunker> weapon
[1:22:08] <DusK_The_Stray> Perfect
[1:22:18] <%aishman> aishman subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 28 months! Hey Paige, thank you for being you. Constantly watching your streams made me not lose my mind with worry as my gf escaped Kiev yesterday. In happier news, did you see DbD got a board game announced?
[1:23:09] <%Jackgar> Thank god your gf got out safely!
[1:23:33] <%aishman> Yeah uh the past week was not the best time. Her poor texts is just constantly me going "Are you okay? are you safe?"
[1:23:36] <%Jackgar> As for a DbD board game, I could totally see how it could work. The trickiest thing is keeping knowledge from the killer but there are ways to figure that out
[1:23:42] <%Jackgar> Oh man it's these guys
[1:23:44] <djblue_shift> i mean if they/re all dead who's to say you were there
[1:24:02] <%aishman> I was even supposed to go this Feb to celebrate Valentine's with her
[1:24:08] <%aishman> but she talked me out of it
[1:24:09] <OToole42> jump attacks are so satisying in this
[1:24:12] <$Sphincter_Spelunker> spermie
[1:24:18] <OToole42> satisfying*
[1:24:18] <MrMoonGoose> Ooh, I missed the emote!
[1:24:27] <%Jackgar> Gonorrhea?
[1:24:28] <+imthewisejanitor> Fire spermies are the worst.
[1:24:31] <MrMoonGoose> Oooh, and it's really good toooooo!
[1:24:32] <%Bloomingzonda> Fire Spermie comes from the fire balls
[1:24:38] <$Sphincter_Spelunker> fucking wolf of wall street emote?
[1:24:38] <stevenellis386> puffin your chest
[1:24:38] <adamant1333> hamboneing
[1:24:55] <%aishman> @jackgar From what the devs said it's gonna be a 1v4 game where the survivors are doing hidden movement?
[1:25:05] <%VentWilsn> no Elden Ring‚Ñ¢ ahead LUL
[1:25:06] <adamant1333> hamboning
[1:25:09] <%Jackgar> @aishman Yeah that's what I would expect
[1:25:20] <stevenellis386> no prob
[1:25:24] <+imthewisejanitor> Did Paige fine the Elden Ring yet??
[1:25:25] <%aishman> @peachsaliva I appreciate you and everything you do dude
[1:25:26] <%FacetiousAF> noooo pat is stinkyyyyyyy
[1:25:26] <+HaloIsA> thank you for giving me something to watch before my shift
[1:25:27] <%CptCreampuff16> keep going
[1:25:27] <%Bloomingzonda> Your streams are always fun
[1:25:33] <Sunstalker> Keep going, it'll be fun.
[1:25:36] <+topendbuzza> pat smelly tho
[1:25:36] <%SveriSageAdvice> I'll stay here if you keep going, I'd love to help
[1:25:39] <+imthewisejanitor> Keep going! If you're feeling it, that is.
[1:25:52] <cartakus> is pat in the late areas?
[1:25:52] <%Jackgar> GOTTEM
[1:25:54] <doster504> I will watch both

[1:26:10] <+StromkoPenguin> It was only like 50 feet, what this horse got arthritis or something? teenB
[1:26:11] <Chester_goes_Berserk> That was 0 to 100 on the fall damage
[1:26:12] <+topendbuzza> mid
[1:26:14] <+Dustwalker44> How important is armor in this game?
[1:26:16] <~PeachSaliva> Im polishing off Caelid
[1:26:19] <~PeachSaliva> I'm heading to Atlus
[1:26:21] <%Bloomingzonda> @PeachSaliva they confirmed that jumping in the air with the horse doesn't save you from fall damage
[1:26:22] <~PeachSaliva> and btw Im peach apparently lol
[1:26:30] <stevenellis386> @PeachSaliva is it possible to invade his game LUL?
[1:26:32] <Zeif00> huehuehuew
[1:26:32] <DracaenaLeaf> hello peachstaresat
[1:26:32] <$Sphincter_Spelunker> I don't think the jump at the last second saves you. You get Gwen Stacy'd
[1:26:33] <%FingaLights> Hi @PeachSaliva

[1:26:52] <TurtlesAndTentacles> Paige why is your butt smelly

[1:26:58] <djblue_shift> he was supposed to only look at radahn but then he liked the horse too much
[1:26:58] <+topendbuzza> we know you have a smelly butt pat
[1:27:04] <%Jackgar> I would give a mild suggestion of advancing Wolf Boy's quest before going through any more of Caelid
[1:27:06] <Hydrapissed> GG
[1:27:11] <%SveriSageAdvice> paige....
[1:27:11] <marvel877> Pat is trying to replace Paige. Won't work, his orb gives him away.

[1:27:49] <%FacetiousAF> but gravity so thicccc
[1:27:49] <@CreepyPorpoise> yeah
[1:27:51] <TurtlesAndTentacles> follow the messages
[1:27:53] <%CptCreampuff16> the starting zone
[1:27:54] <%SveriSageAdvice> in Limgrave
[1:27:56] <+imthewisejanitor> Gravity just comes out of NOWHERE...
[1:28:07] <%Bloomingzonda> The way fall damage in this game works is it look at the height you started falling and where you stop falling to calculate damage. Nothing that slows you down helps @PeachSaliva
[1:28:10] <@CreepyPorpoise> If you look on your map he's pretty much right near the starting area. black circle on the map in the south
[1:28:12] <%Pukenasty> south of castle gate follow road
[1:28:14] <+goblinking92> its a black disk on the map
[1:28:16] <%Jackgar> Like right before you cross the bridge to the peninsula, it's up on a cliff
[1:28:24] <+StromkoPenguin> Gravity never hurt anybody, it's the rapid decelleration that's a jerk.
[1:28:33] <DusK_The_Stray> Some gravity is fake, lol
[1:28:37] <jetpack_rorschasch> That‚Äôs why I want a jet pack, so I can give gravity the finger and tell it to go fuck itself!
[1:28:42] <Willowight> isnt it calculated with air time and sometimes kill boxes
[1:28:48] <%FacetiousAF> gravity isn't real just swim in the air 4Head
[1:28:48] <%SveriSageAdvice> moonlight altar is up on top of the cliff, you can't get there yet
[1:28:59] <%Jackgar> I actually killed the guy he wanted me to kill hours before I ever met Wolfie
[1:29:11] <%CptCreampuff16> black circle south of the lake for wolf man enemy
[1:29:20] <+goblinking92> lower
[1:29:20] <@CreepyPorpoise> no no south of the starting area
[1:29:21] <%Bloomingzonda> There are places where they up the fall damage to stop sequence breaks
[1:29:24] <justcallmebobplease> STARTER AREA, Paige.
[1:29:27] <+topendbuzza> stupid Newton making gravity a thing
[1:29:28] <%TheMoenia> thanks for the stream peach, have a nice day everyone. its getting late over here
[1:29:29] <justcallmebobplease> South in STARTER AREA

[1:29:39] <%SveriSageAdvice> limgrave south of starting dungeon
[1:29:39] <%Bloomingzonda> dragon lake
[1:29:42] <Sunstalker> soutnext to the bridghe
[1:29:43] <justcallmebobplease> THAT GRAY CIRCLE

[1:29:45] <@CreepyPorpoise> Yeaah
[1:29:45] <%CptCreampuff16> yee
[1:29:46] <@CreepyPorpoise> thats it
[1:29:56] <%SveriSageAdvice> yes
[1:29:58] <%CptCreampuff16> nahh
[1:29:59] <%Jackgar> Now would be the perfect time for you to fight him
[1:30:01] <justcallmebobplease> NOT WITH WOLF BOY
[1:30:02] <%aishman> Not with wolfman help
[1:30:08] <%Bloomingzonda> Peach pat showed you this on his stream the other night so you could find it
[1:30:09] <$Sphincter_Spelunker> don't tell her
[1:30:10] <%aishman> Pat did it by himself though
[1:30:10] <+goblinking92> summon wolf man for help
[1:30:11] <+imthewisejanitor> Fear the bad, hard man.
[1:30:13] <%SveriSageAdvice> he will be easier now
[1:30:15] <%Jackgar> Let's just say you have experience with the fight
[1:30:15] <%Pukenasty> yes
[1:30:18] <@CreepyPorpoise> I killed him on my first try in on my first day of playing, just to flex creepy49Porpkek
[1:30:20] <MrMoonGoose> Is Paige totally crushing this game, y'all?
[1:30:25] <%CptCreampuff16> yea
[1:30:28] <%aishman> Yes
[1:30:34] <$Sphincter_Spelunker> nice helping
[1:30:41] <%SveriSageAdvice> Paige is absolutely crushing it
[1:30:48] <%Jackgar> @CreepyPorpoise Honestly I didn't even know he was something meant for later. I killed him before Margit. Then I used the weapon I got from him against Margit
[1:30:50] <%VentWilsn> by getting crushed by realities of gravity, then yes shes crushing it Kappa
[1:30:50] <+CalderGaming> [screaming and crying] IM HELPING IM HELPIIIIING
[1:30:51] <+eviiLJK> "ill help out" lets copernicus die
[1:30:52] <%SveriSageAdvice> and occasionally being crushed
[1:31:25] <+topendbuzza> you helped
[1:31:47] <+stickygumbolee> call an ambulance, but not for me
[1:32:00] <dukenux> this is probably against souls design philosophy, but itd be cool if there were some neutral mooks roaming the land
[1:32:05] <$Sphincter_Spelunker> what's with the Mario 2 enemies
[1:32:22] <dukenux> Bob-omb
[1:32:33] <%CptCreampuff16> yes
[1:32:33] <+goblinking92> yes
[1:32:37] <$Sirtimbob> Cheer500 as thanks for you help dear tarnished
[1:32:39] <%Jackgar> There's a sttattue around, it's fine
[1:32:41] <%Bloomingzonda> Yeah they make me think of Wiggler as well
[1:32:54] <+goblinking92> you activated the statue
[1:32:59] <%CptCreampuff16> you activate marika statues just by being nearby
[1:33:02] <+sonofthedeepsouth> So I've finnally watched Arcanum and I must say Jinx deserve to be trial as a terrorist and be dealt with accordingly fuck mental patient she gets the peace of the grave. No Kappa. She is basically schizophrenic ISIS
[1:33:23] <MrMoonGoose> Oh, I didn't know that.
[1:33:28] <+CalderGaming> it means you're in its sphere of influence. it's automatic
[1:33:29] <%VentWilsn> those fucking towers move like centipedes? GROSS
[1:33:30] <fumbles_tho> Its automatic
[1:33:31] <%Jackgar> As long as you're in the general area of it you're covered
[1:33:32] <%FingaLights> You just need to be near one
[1:33:33] <TurtlesAndTentacles> your souls will be on the outside  when you die
[1:34:04] <+topendbuzza> thanks pat but so wash your smelly ballz
[1:34:05] <+sonofthedeepsouth> wash the balls for her Pat

[1:34:41] <@CreepyPorpoise> I even talked to him before I came here, I just didn't even notice
[1:34:44] <%FingaLights> Perfect height
[1:34:49] <%Jackgar> It's your buddy!
[1:34:50] <DusK_The_Stray> He just kicks his ass super hard, holy shit

[1:35:04] <doster504> this is the first boss I fought lmao
[1:35:07] <%Jackgar> Yeah honestly Bladd could probably just solo this guy
[1:35:07] <@CreepyPorpoise> wow
[1:35:08] <MrMoonGoose> I wish I'd met Blaide before I found Darriwil lol
[1:35:09] <DusK_The_Stray> Nice

[1:35:13] <%Jackgar> That weapon is SUPER AWESOME
[1:35:16] <%CptCreampuff16> thats a really good sword
[1:35:18] <%Jackgar> I used it for a long time
[1:35:25] <%FingaLights> Building to use that now
[1:35:27] <%Pukenasty> wish i new wolfy could help, oh well
[1:35:27] <DusK_The_Stray> I wish I met Blaide too, fuck hahah
[1:35:36] <%Jackgar> Curved Greatsword
[1:35:37] <jetpack_rorschasch> I like to think Pat stretches out his ballsack and scrubs it on one of those old washboards
[1:35:45] <%Jackgar> Below scimitar
[1:35:47] <DusK_The_Stray> Just missed it
[1:35:50] <%Bloomingzonda> above ax
[1:35:52] <MrMoonGoose> It's real good. Built in quick dodge + strong attack
[1:36:04] <%Jackgar> You only need 3 more dex
[1:36:09] <doster504> that sword got me through half of the game
[1:36:13] <doster504> really strong
[1:36:15] <%Bloomingzonda> I just call him dog daddy
[1:36:16] <$Sphincter_Spelunker> curved greatswords are my fav souls weapons
[1:36:18] <bundle_of_herbs> like blithe
[1:36:19] <$Sphincter_Spelunker> ladies
[1:36:22] <DusK_The_Stray> I would think it's like Blade, but iunno
[1:36:22] <%CptCreampuff16> its a greatsword with bleed
[1:36:22] <%Pukenasty> im still using this sword
[1:36:23] <Ipsenscastle> Yeah it's Welsh, the double D makes a 'th'
[1:36:23] <%Jackgar> But that's also because you're wearing the item that gives +3 to all physical stats
[1:36:25] <+imthewisejanitor> Blithy
[1:36:26] <%ceremight> I still use it now lol
[1:36:28] <%strakillias> That sword is VERY good cause it does bleed
[1:36:30] <%FacetiousAF> @CptCreampuff16 psaGib
[1:36:33] <%Jackgar> So you would need 6 more dex if you take that amulet off
[1:36:41] <OverpricedTaco> I used that weapon my entire playthrough and beat the game with it, it's exceptional
[1:36:43] <Willowight> do you have a talisman with dex?
[1:36:50] <TurtlesAndTentacles> Bimmy
[1:37:00] <%Jackgar> @Willowight Yeah she's using the one that gives +3 to all physical stats
[1:37:01] <stevenellis386> so hes not a furry?

[1:37:44] <TurtlesAndTentacles> how did you get to meet Blaidd
[1:37:51] <%Bloomingzonda> Dragon dragon rock the drag paige

[1:38:36] <%AncelDeLambert> oh fuck i completely missed him
[1:38:48] <%Bloomingzonda> that is the tutorial building paige
[1:38:49] <+wizard_of_diamonds> Thank you, Ma'am
[1:38:51] <%cade_calrayn> tyhink that's the starting cave, Paige
[1:38:53] <%CptCreampuff16> thats the exist for starting zone
[1:38:55] <TurtlesAndTentacles> listen? does he howl?
[1:38:58] <TurtlesAndTentacles> okay cool
[1:39:08] <+BoboDaHobo> I completely missed him in the forest but starting rannis quest let's you meet him too
[1:39:09] <Sirtimbob> Country bear jamboree forest?
[1:39:14] <%FingaLights> You hear him.... Then you see him
[1:39:17] <%cade_calrayn> I mean there *is* the dungeon with Oleg under there, Paige
[1:39:19] <%tentavision> once you've heard him.... what
[1:39:20] <%cade_calrayn> You could give that a try
[1:39:31] <%tentavision> awoooo?
[1:39:36] <%Jackgar> Trust me, there's no way you'll miss finding Blaidd's buddy later on. He is also a big friend.
[1:39:37] <jetpack_rorschasch> There‚Äôs so much in this game that you can miss. I‚Äôm genuinely anxious about even starting it. NotLikeThis
[1:39:52] <+heyitsbrian> What sound does the wolf man make?  *HONK HONK*
[1:40:00] <TurtlesAndTentacles> I'm just gonna play while you play lol I keep watching everyone and forget to play on my own lol
[1:40:12] <Jetsfantasy> A second or third playthrough can always go back and doing new things
[1:40:18] <TheSaggitari> Go find the pope
[1:40:18] <$Sphincter_Spelunker> goblins too strong
[1:40:26] <%Jackgar> Oh once you hear Blaidd the firstt time in the forest, make sure to go back and talk to the first merchant you meet so you can tell you how to actually tallk to Blaidd
[1:40:35] <%cade_calrayn> Nope
[1:40:38] <%Jackgar> Horse > Dragon
[1:40:41] <%cade_calrayn> All Hail the Turtle Pope
[1:40:48] <%cade_calrayn> Long may he reign
[1:40:52] <%CptCreampuff16> horse
[1:41:00] <%Jackgar> Just horse it up
[1:41:03] <Jobless_Floppy> horse, the ultimate summon
[1:41:07] <%Jackgar> Turtle Pope is Dope
[1:41:08] <sirrice77> @jetpack_rorschasch You kinda can't actually miss most things, only things actually "missable" are endings and quests since npcs can die and you can only have one ending. Otherwise everything stays where it is and you can go find it whenever
[1:41:10] <jetpack_rorschasch> Well crab man wants to touch you
[1:41:19] <%Jackgar> Switch to the BIG sword?
[1:41:22] <+CalderGaming> something that casts lightning or magic if you have it
[1:41:33] <TurtlesAndTentacles> not in this one
[1:41:58] <TurtlesAndTentacles> Paige do you want a tip
[1:42:00] <Nitsuj293> The turtle pope's church jumpscared me during a revisit ngl
[1:42:05] <Jetsfantasy> Jelly is just a good general summon
[1:42:10] <%Jackgar> Honestly I jus tgot up in the dragon's ass with the horse and crushed him. But I also didn't fight the dragon until right before killing Godrick
[1:42:12] <Jetsfantasy> Tanky and ranged
[1:42:22] <Jetsfantasy> Aurelia is her name I think
[1:42:26] <+RedMaskBandit> Theres always been missable content like invasions and optional areas
[1:42:29] <+imthewisejanitor> Just the tip of the tip?
[1:42:30] <Sunstalker> I think jellies are asequeal?
[1:42:31] <Jetsfantasy> No, the jelly is tanky and ranged
[1:42:34] <Nitsuj293> Jelly is probably the best for this
[1:42:35] <%cade_calrayn> ^^
[1:42:41] <DracaenaLeaf> are they on top of the cliff?
[1:42:43] <%cade_calrayn> Jets was talking about the Jelly, Paige
[1:42:44] <%Jackgar> No they mean the jelly is ttanky and ranged. You actually want to be quick and in the dragon's butt
[1:42:49] <jetpack_rorschasch> Just the tip
[1:42:52] <LePipes> equip the jello!
[1:42:52] <%ceremight> Yup I just rode horsey around while stabbing his toes.

[1:49:39] <%Jackgar> It has to do with ballsack skin
[1:49:48] <OldOnyx> google is not your friend
[1:49:50] <@CreepyPorpoise> Getting real "t-shirt and socks with no pants cause I ran away from the changing table" baby vibe from this
[1:49:51] <%FingaLights> Don't not google Batwinging
[1:49:53] <+imthewisejanitor> Soemtiems you just gotta air-dry
[1:49:57] <%FacetiousAF> look at a bat wing and guess how you make a scrote do that
[1:50:03] <+imthewisejanitor> Wow, words are hard.
[1:50:06] <Psyramics> do not Google unless you feeling brave
[1:50:07] <TheSaggitari> POPE
[1:50:09] <$hewlettfan96> Oh right do you hold ur pecker up to constitute a middle finger
[1:50:16] <+topendbuzza> you know how bat wings are made of stretched skin yeah it's that
[1:50:34] <%Jackgar> There might be something in that hole on the map near where you fight the dragon...just saiyan'...
[1:50:43] <TheSaggitari> Search for the church
[1:50:43] <CrunchyPoopSoup> damn so many people here knowing what bat winging is
[1:50:44] <%cade_calrayn> Rampart Tower has door outside and stairs up to roof
[1:50:47] <%cade_calrayn> those are the options
[1:51:00] <$hewlettfan96> @creepyporpoise What do u mean? What about a changing table???
[1:51:13] <%Jackgar> Being able to just jump whenever in a Souls game is wild
[1:51:41] <%FingaLights> I just beat this Castle last night, think i'm 30 hours in. This is gonna be a long game for me
[1:51:43] <%Jackgar> Oh it's going to be a nightmare
[1:51:48] <TurtlesAndTentacles> Never back only forward lol
[1:51:49] <$mattwillpost> I straight up didn't use the jump for like my first 5 hours because I JUST FORGOT
[1:51:54] <$hewlettfan96> Wait what you couldn‚Äôt jump!!!? Before
[1:52:03] <%FacetiousAF> that sounds super real
[1:52:03] <+cvp5127> i forget crafting exist
[1:52:06] <%cade_calrayn> You never explored this area because you were running from the knights, Paige
[1:52:07] <%Jackgar> Before the only way to jump is while you're running
[1:52:07] <$hewlettfan96> Jesus that must have made things hard
[1:52:10] <%FacetiousAF> "new souls game, why would i try a JUMP"
[1:52:15] <%Jackgar> So you could only use running leaps
[1:52:18] <%cade_calrayn> it's a dead end but worth exploring
[1:52:21] <$Sphincter_Spelunker> Sekiro had a jump
[1:52:25] <$Sphincter_Spelunker> it was dope
[1:52:33] <%Jackgar> Sekiro is a way different combat vibe though
[1:52:50] <%Jackgar> I hardly even consider that a Souls game. It's its own thing
[1:52:50] <%FingaLights> SO STRONG
[1:52:51] <$hewlettfan96> That‚Äôs so weird why couldn‚Äôt you jump in the previous games, seems kind of like a useless removal, almost every 3D game ever has a jump feature
[1:52:54] <+The_EL_Destino> godspeed...godspeed
[1:53:46] <$hewlettfan96> What function is served removing the jump feature, is it just to make it harder? Ahh that‚Äôs it
[1:53:49] <jetpack_rorschasch> It‚Äôs like they took the combat mechanics of DS3 and mixed it with Sekiros gameplay mechanics.
[1:53:59] <%FingaLights> @hewlettfan96 Zelda didn't have a jump till BotW I think
[1:53:59] <%CptCreampuff16> i think i missed her goin south of the penninsula
[1:54:03] <%Jackgar> The game was just never designed with being able to jump in mind
[1:54:19] <%Jackgar> If you add a jump, combat needs to be designed with that option in mind
[1:54:30] <%Bloomingzonda> @hewlettfan96 There was a little jump it just wasn't useful
[1:54:32] <%Jackgar> "but hole" message DRINK!
[1:54:51] <%Jackgar> WOLF BOY
[1:55:04] <$hewlettfan96> @fingalights No you could definetly jump in Majoras mask and every game onwards, it was a command prompt for specific situations but it was still there
[1:55:26] <%Jackgar> Did you talk to the guy who wanted you to go to Morn?
[1:55:38] <$hewlettfan96> @bloomingzonda Ah but you can still duck and roll right?
[1:55:50] <%Jackgar> A lot of high end weapons are going to want you to have some dex anyway
[1:55:59] <%BogBodyPositive> BogBodyPositive subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 14 months! peach stream woot woot
[1:56:05] <%CptCreampuff16> the bloodhound sword can easily take you to endgame
[1:56:08] <leinadtonu> I don't even have a map for the south, and I finished the castle there.
[1:56:13] <%Bloomingzonda> @hewlettfan96 roll yes but not crouch there wasn't any stealth till sekiro which also added the jump
[1:56:23] <%CptCreampuff16> 3
[1:56:33] <%Jackgar> You need 16 dex total for the bloodhound's fang
[1:56:35] <%JoshManVGH> No dex need str
[1:56:39] <%FingaLights> @hewlettfan96 then darksouls would have a jump under that it just wasn't a dedicated jump button
[1:56:44] <%Jackgar> Which is the weapon you got from helping wolf boy
[1:56:48] <sirrice77> It requires 40 str and 14 dex for grafted blade
[1:56:50] <%cade_calrayn> Attributes Required
[1:56:51] <%JoshManVGH> See the attribure required secrion?
[1:56:52] <%CptCreampuff16> attribute required
[1:56:53] <$Sphincter_Spelunker> the red numbers
[1:56:54] <+SPplayer> that sword is also super heavy, its putting you into fat roll
[1:56:57] <tigerfang86> Attributes Required
[1:57:01] <%cade_calrayn> Middle of the page
[1:57:02] <%JoshManVGH> Yep
[1:57:02] <DusK_The_Stray> The part that says Attributes Required
[1:57:04] <%cade_calrayn> Lol
[1:57:04] <SecondBerial> @peachsaliva read the info on the Jelly summon
[1:57:05] <%Jackgar> >.>
[1:57:08] <%FacetiousAF> mmmmm
[1:57:08] <$Sphincter_Spelunker> atpCap
[1:57:09] <DracaenaLeaf> :)
[1:57:10] <%tentavision> paige are you wearing your glasses????
[1:57:13] <%FacetiousAF> HOW THOSE GLASSES
[1:57:14] <%JoshManVGH> It's a lot of info
[1:57:15] <%Jackgar> So when I was talking about Dex, it was for the other weapon you just got
[1:57:16] <%cade_calrayn> the blindness
[1:57:17] <$hewlettfan96> @bloomingzonda Oh right I see
[1:57:19] <%VentWilsn> sipsipSipsipblind sipsipSipsipblind sipsipSipsipblind
[1:57:19] <sirrice77> well honestly for me the red numbers are slightly harder to read
[1:57:26] <$hewlettfan96> @fingalights I see
[1:57:27] <@CreepyPorpoise> its a busy screen with a ton of numberss
[1:57:29] <%FacetiousAF> did you know she guessed her prescription
[1:57:43] <SecondBerial> melfin1ThumbsUp
[1:57:44] <%Jackgar> The one from fighting the guy in the Evergaol that Blaidd helped you with. It's a super good curved greatsword that does bleeding.
[1:57:47] <DusK_The_Stray> Oh wow, that's adorable
[1:57:48] <$hewlettfan96> Lool paige being ditzy again
[1:57:49] <%CptCreampuff16> blood hound sword has bleed which makes it really strong
[1:57:59] <@CreepyPorpoise> You know where else you can get a jellyfish friend named Aurelia? FFXIV.
[1:58:01] <%FacetiousAF> me tooooo
[1:58:02] <Sirtimbob> Paige what system are you plalying on?
[1:58:11] <%Jackgar> So scroll down to that other new sword
[1:58:12] <Sunstalker> @PeachSaliva Aurelia bedalia? Kappa
[1:58:21] <TurtlesAndTentacles> Dont feel bad Paige, I figured it a few moments before you did
[1:58:26] <%Jackgar> Bloodhound Fang
[1:58:30] <$Sphincter_Spelunker> that was a dex sword
[1:58:35] <%Jackgar> Above axe
[1:58:37] <DusK_The_Stray> Bloodhound Fang
[1:58:40] <%Jackgar> No
[1:58:44] <SecondBerial> @creepyporpoise melfin1Sip
[1:58:44] <TurtlesAndTentacles> Blood Fang
[1:58:55] <%FacetiousAF> bloodhound gang?!
[1:58:59] <%Jackgar> That's what you got from helping Blaidd
[1:59:01] <%AMajorTom> 3-2-1 Contact!
[1:59:05] <leinadtonu> That thing is a beast.
[1:59:06] <%cade_calrayn> that's a Bloodborne
[1:59:06] <%JoshManVGH> Cooooool!
[1:59:11] <%FacetiousAF> you get... a backflip?!
[1:59:25] <%Jackgar> It's pretty sweet
[1:59:39] <jetpack_rorschasch> Speaking of Sekiro‚Ä¶
[1:59:40] <+RedMaskBandit> Do a flip!
[1:59:46] <DusK_The_Stray> What weapon is Paige using?
[1:59:49] <SecondBerial> @peachsaliva it's a backflip with a unique heavy follow up
[1:59:50] <%CptCreampuff16> keep going
[1:59:56] <%Bloomingzonda> Fun fact Aurelia is actually one of the most common jellyfish genus
[1:59:58] <BigBadWolf009> keep going
[1:59:59] <+FattimusSlime> mommy daddy don't make us choose
[2:00:00] <%Bloomingzonda> KEEP GOING
[2:00:01] <+imthewisejanitor> If you keep going, I will stay.
[2:00:02] <TurtlesAndTentacles> Send us and come back if you want
[2:00:04] <$Sphincter_Spelunker> pat smells
[2:00:07] <%Jackgar> Also note that you only have 31 str and 15 dex now because you're wearing that one talisman, so just never take that talisman off
[2:00:08] <%cade_calrayn> Up to you, I'm gonna watch you both
[2:00:10] <%FingaLights> Keep going
[2:00:10] <TheSaggitari> Is he gonna bat wing us?
[2:00:11] <+RedMaskBandit> Do what u want Queen.
[2:00:15] <jetpack_rorschasch> What do you want Paige?
[2:00:18] <Danitaras> depends....is pat still naked?
[2:00:20] <Midnight188> if only coop stream was possible
[2:00:20] <%VentWilsn> i mean this stream was pretty early from when u usually go live
[2:00:29] <+barrakuta371> Up to you. May want to take a break at some point though
[2:00:57] <%JoshManVGH> Stab the small things!
[2:01:01] <BigBadWolf009> im gonna watch both anyway
[2:01:02] <%CptCreampuff16> farm till you can use the sword?
[2:01:03] <jetpack_rorschasch> Then just do some farming SeemsGood
[2:01:04] <+cvp5127> pat smells tho
[2:01:06] <Valtorias> farm some armor?
[2:01:10] <stevenellis386> you should invade his game
[2:01:23] <stevenellis386> IF thats a thing
[2:01:23] <$Sphincter_Spelunker> pat's on console
[2:01:24] <%SveriSageAdvice> ye his stream is up, i'll hang out here for now tho
[2:01:31] <%Jackgar> So it might not be a bad idea to use the Bloodhound Fang for a while because you're almost there, then go back to pumping up STR so you can use the BIG sword long-term
[2:01:36] <stevenellis386> oh
[2:01:53] <Sunstalker> Damn, I found the Nightrider Glaive finally. it drops from the wrong enemy, Fromsoft messed up.
[2:02:03] <$Sphincter_Spelunker> no
[2:02:04] <%JoshManVGH> Only solution is to buy a secret playstation then dunk!
[2:02:09] <%VentWilsn> i mean he is a dingdong but that's not the only reason
[2:02:11] <sirrice77> its right above the axe
[2:02:15] <%Jackgar> Not yet, that only works for STR unfortunately
[2:02:20] <%Jackgar> You can swing it around and see its moveset though
[2:02:31] <%strakillias> Its on its own below scimitar
[2:02:34] <$Sphincter_Spelunker> she hasn't been wearing her glasses the entire stream atpCap
[2:02:38] <sirrice77> and i think you're lacking dex with bloodhound
[2:02:44] <%Jackgar> You can check out the moveset at least
[2:02:47] <tigerfang86> you need 17 dex
[2:02:48] <%JoshManVGH> This you do need more Dex
[2:02:49] <tigerfang86> your str is fine
[2:02:53] <%Jackgar> Can you do the L@?
[2:02:57] <%JoshManVGH> Nice!
[2:02:59] <%Jackgar> THERE IT ISQ!
[2:03:02] <%Jackgar> Love that move
[2:03:04] <sirrice77> the l2 and a follow up
[2:03:06] <$GreenHerbWhiteSmoke> have you beat margrit?
[2:03:07] <sirrice77> if you press it again
[2:03:14] <%Jackgar> It's also super practical because it gets you out
[2:03:26] <hermitdab> follow the L2 up
[2:03:41] <hermitdab> you get an extra bloodborne dash attack basiclaly
[2:03:44] <hermitdab> basically
[2:03:45] <+barkon345> is there anything like the dark wood grain ring, that give you an actual back-lit in this game?
[2:03:45] <$GreenHerbWhiteSmoke> secret doom portal Pog
[2:03:47] <%king_wragles> Someone left their oven on
[2:03:50] <%king_wragles> OR it's that guy

[2:03:59] <Angerest> stumbled upon it 30 minutes ago

[2:03:59] <%CptCreampuff16> friend?

[2:04:14] <%Jackgar> Sometimes you just gotta do some howling
[2:04:22] <$GreenHerbWhiteSmoke> moon phases? mangoHmm
[2:04:23] <%FacetiousAF> maybe he likes the rain
[2:04:29] <tigerfang86> Sometimes you just have to howl at the gods in rage
[2:04:36] <%cade_calrayn> Guranq?
[2:04:42] <+CalderGaming> yup
[2:04:44] <Valkryna> did you kill the black gargoyle outside
[2:04:45] <%JoshManVGH> That's it
[2:04:46] <Valkryna> ?
[2:04:47] <+imthewisejanitor> Fumigating, he's not allowed inside.
[2:04:47] <%Jackgar> Feed him death roots and he gives you unique incantations
[2:04:48] <%FacetiousAF> check for wall?
[2:04:49] <$GreenHerbWhiteSmoke> he eats death? POGGIES
[2:04:50] <+ReefTheWizard> hes just vibin
[2:04:58] <Sunstalker> Death Vegetables you steal from Death rowing his boat, to feed to the werewolf pope D:
[2:05:08] <%FacetiousAF> shout outs to werewolf pope
[2:05:17] <$GreenHerbWhiteSmoke> peach stumbles upon success PogBones
[2:05:21] <Nitsuj293> apparently people found another easy farm in the area
[2:05:28] <%Jackgar> Yeah what's cool is all these places that can be reached by portals or trap chests can also often be reached the "normal" way
[2:05:36] <Angerest> looks like a standing fan
[2:05:42] <Nitsuj293> it is
[2:05:48] <%Jackgar> Isn't there the spot with a bunch of giants hanging around?
[2:05:52] <hydragoon513> Damn, I assumed the warp wouldn't work until the npc marked it.
[2:06:18] <%JoshManVGH> Is a farm area with more than 1000e to 1300 runes per kill?
[2:06:20] <Angerest> Horse works well
[2:06:22] <%FacetiousAF> SICK
[2:06:23] <%Jackgar> There's a field with a bunch of giants hanging around that are pretty easy and give like 1200 a pop
[2:06:31] <$GreenHerbWhiteSmoke> SHEESH
[2:06:41] <Nitsuj293> Near Lenne's Rise there is a ball that you can trick off a cliff, gives you 1900 per
[2:06:42] <%FacetiousAF> SHEEEEEEESSHHH
[2:06:45] <Midnight188> see im 5head and i just throw magic pebbles at everything. i'll throw rocks at god idc.
[2:06:55] <@CreepyPorpoise> hm
[2:07:04] <%SveriSageAdvice> i swung through here at level 70 and they still kicked my ass when they get a good swing in
[2:07:04] <@CreepyPorpoise> "metaphorically"
[2:07:08] <%FacetiousAF> uh oh porp is having a thought
[2:07:11] <Minorou> what a pro tip
[2:07:14] <cartakus> there is like 10 to 15 of these guys
[2:07:39] <Nitsuj293> and Lenne's rise is right under this area so this truely is the farming zone
[2:07:39] <Maids4lyfe> if GRRM had his way I'm pretty sure the enemies would also fuck you literally
[2:07:46] <$GreenHerbWhiteSmoke> PepoG run up and stab
[2:07:55] <%VentWilsn> wtf @Maids4lyfe
[2:08:08] <%AncelDeLambert> kudos to Paige for calling them "runes" because I still say "souls"
[2:08:12] <+imthewisejanitor> My uncles are named Chris, Ray, and Gary, but thank you.

[2:08:55] <Danitaras> Bob's your uncle and Sally's your aunt
[2:08:57] <Maids4lyfe> @VentWilsn GRRM is the writer of the back story
[2:09:03] <%tentavision> he goes by rob technically but whatever
[2:09:13] <+badhaye> you can kill the night calvary guy with a cheese strat that involves running him through the poison area.
[2:09:16] <+barkon345> pisses
[2:09:18] <$GreenHerbWhiteSmoke> pretty gruesome how youre replacing their spine with your sword
[2:09:18] <+The_EL_Destino> stealthy puma
[2:09:20] <%Jackgar> Yeah I think the field of giants might be faster. These guys die quick but they're SOOOOO spread out and you have to sneak around
[2:09:28] <%FacetiousAF> @badhaye mental note taken
[2:09:33] <+barkon345> the bobs your uncle
[2:09:34] <Nitsuj293> If you go down the ramp near Lenne's rise you can trick a ball off a cliff for 1900 souls @PeachSaliva
[2:09:36] <@SoFarFetched> Like twitter taking her literally and seriously geefPlz

[2:09:53] <%Jackgar> I think they're mushrooms
[2:10:00] <cartakus> with a collosal greatsword that backstab is so brutal, you beat them down them crush them with the sword
[2:10:01] <+imthewisejanitor> Uncle Chris was the one who gave me MGS1 for Christmas as a child, which turned into a lifelong love of all things Kojima and Metal Gear, so yeah, he's pretty alright.
[2:10:01] <MittensBroadcast> oh dang your both streaming right now i dont know who to watch noooooooooooo

[2:10:55] <Spydurman> @PeachSaliva ever been to Columbus Ohio? Considering moving there cause of family and how expensive shit is here
[2:10:56] <%Bloomingzonda> Southern Illinois just seems like the rest of the Midwest to me
[2:10:57] <%FacetiousAF> respectfully
[2:10:57] <Maids4lyfe> Yeah okay that makes sense
[2:11:00] <+imthewisejanitor> "No one will see me while shopping for socks at K-mart."
[2:11:03] <hermitdab> We have South at home.... Illinois
[2:11:11] <%FingaLights> It's Mid west. Feel the same for Missouri
[2:11:11] <Jetsfantasy> The False South
[2:11:21] <hermitdab> Liar South ahead
[2:11:25] <Maids4lyfe> lmao
[2:11:32] <%Bloomingzonda> Yeah we call all soda coke in New Mexico as well
[2:11:32] <%VentWilsn> damn right sprite
[2:11:32] <Maids4lyfe> Water is naked coke
[2:11:33] <+CalderGaming> so is sweet tea just flat coke Kappa
[2:11:40] <%AMajorTom> That was the same for me, I was in my twenties before I realized it was weird.
[2:11:48] <+barkon345> I thought soda was pop in the midwest
[2:11:49] <+imthewisejanitor> But why not just say the thing you want first???
[2:11:51] <jetpack_rorschasch> I‚Äôm learning so much about America from Paige‚Äôs descriptions of it. Kappa
[2:11:59] <+TopTieramisu> like how bandaid is interchangeable with bandage
[2:12:10] <+imthewisejanitor> Just say "I would like a Sprite???"
[2:12:11] <SecondBerial> melfin1Hypers
[2:12:23] <@SoFarFetched> They Might Be Giants geefThink
[2:12:28] <TurtlesAndTentacles> I just started Paige wish me luck

[2:12:38] <@Jekado> even in this area early on you can use the wolves to help you farm
[2:12:38] <Nitsuj293> this is faster then giants ngl
[2:12:38] <%FacetiousAF> @SoFarFetched You Might Be Chimken ü§î
[2:12:40] <%tentavision> ok nvm new question- who the hell goes to a restaurant and says " i want a carbonated beverage but i wont say which until you ask"
[2:12:44] <@SoFarFetched> geefBlank
[2:12:45] <@Jekado> since you get the wolves super early
[2:12:46] <%Bloomingzonda> @imthewisejanitor Its more like what kind of coke do you have. Its the blanket term instead of soda or pop
[2:12:46] <+barkon345> so if you said you wanted a pop would people look at you weird?
[2:12:47] <%Jackgar> The giants get fucked up super bad by bleeding weapons like the Bloodhound Fang
[2:12:52] <+CalderGaming> some say Kosm
[2:12:55] <+TopTieramisu> waffles
[2:12:57] <$Sphincter_Spelunker> waffles
[2:13:00] <hermitdab> waffles are GOATED
[2:13:02] <@CreepyPorpoise> pancakes
[2:13:02] <%FacetiousAF> i'm team syrup
[2:13:04] <+cvp5127> hes wrong
[2:13:05] <%Jackgar> Belgian Waffles, tho
[2:13:07] <Dreigun> waffles
[2:13:07] <%Bloomingzonda> I like pancakes better
[2:13:08] <%tentavision> both are great but i prefer pancakes.
[2:13:09] <$zyberion626> pancakes are great, but waffles are amazing
[2:13:11] <Spydurman> pancakes are amazing
[2:13:12] <IssaBoneman> Sup Peach! Having a good deathless run?
[2:13:12] <+twdlrr> just like if you wanted to you could get the milk bag and put it in the pitcher rather than buyng a carton
[2:13:17] <DusK_The_Stray> French Toast. though
[2:13:18] <+barkon345> eh French Toast over all of those
[2:13:21] <+imthewisejanitor> @imthewisejanitor Sure, but "what kind of coke do you have" is different from "I would like a coke."
[2:13:21] <+badhaye> WAFFLE HOOOOUSE!
[2:13:23] <$Sphincter_Spelunker> gimme the crispy edge and fluffy inside
[2:13:24] <hermitdab> Waffle House > IHOP
[2:13:24] <%FingaLights> Frozen Pancakes are better than Frozen Waffles, but fresh Waffles are better than Fresh Pancakes
[2:13:30] <$zyberion626> waffles require a waffle iron so it's more special
[2:13:31] <Zeif00> Depends on how they're dressed tbh
[2:13:31] <+RedMaskBandit> I like that waffles can be crunch
[2:13:31] <%AMajorTom> Waffles are better, but pancakes are easier to make.
[2:13:32] <+TopTieramisu> if the pancakes are super fluffy, then you have an argument
[2:13:38] <IssaBoneman> And waffles go hard pancakes saggy like my grandmas ass cheeks
[2:13:39] <+cvp5127> damn im coverting to waffle
[2:13:39] <@CreepyPorpoise> Yeah I could see that, I've had dessert waffles that were pretty good
[2:13:40] <+badhaye> Nothings more comfy than a waffle house waffle at 2 in the morning
[2:13:40] <Chester_goes_Berserk> pancake unless belgian
[2:13:40] <SecondBerial> good waffles are crispy. good pancakes are still soggy
[2:13:41] <%tentavision> pancakes>waffles unless theyre waffle house waffles
[2:13:49] <+celestialkitty> I prefer pancake but we're having waffles at our wedding.
[2:13:49] <hermitdab> truthhhhh
[2:13:52] <%AMajorTom> I have had more total enjoyment from pancakes over my lifetime.
[2:13:53] <Zakaraz> flapjacks/crepes
[2:13:55] <+CalderGaming> agree w/ paige
[2:13:57] <%CopperTucker> waffles are better than pancakes
[2:13:59] <DusK_The_Stray> Like a Syrup Gusher
[2:14:01] <@SoFarFetched> geefJuice drink the syrup
[2:14:05] <peachy996> The pockets are useless
[2:14:05] <+TopTieramisu> sponge isn't the most appetizing descriptor of food
[2:14:05] <%Jackgar> I like the light cruncy texture of a waffle
[2:14:09] <jetpack_rorschasch> Both are a good time in my books
[2:14:12] <Jetsfantasy> Guess I'm having breakfast for dinner tonight LUL
[2:14:14] <$Sphincter_Spelunker> but then the pancakes need more syrup
[2:14:14] <hermitdab> pancakes are like girl pants.. no pockets
[2:14:15] <%tentavision> NO THE PANCAKE CAN'T BE ALLOWED TO SOAK IT RUINS THE TEXTUUUURE
[2:14:17] <shyrstyne> but then pancake get soggy and texture bad :(
[2:14:20] <+imthewisejanitor> Always carry syrup in your pockets, kids.
[2:14:23] <%I4gotmyname89> chocolate chip pancakes are great
[2:14:43] <%Jackgar> A perfect waffle is crunchy on the outside but have some fluffiness on the inside
[2:14:49] <%Jackgar> And it's.....mmmmm
[2:14:51] <hermitdab> no one wants a sweaty pancake
[2:15:00] <hermitdab> unlike a sweaty you know what
[2:15:00] <+barkon345> French Toast >> Waffles or Pancakes
[2:15:02] <$Sphincter_Spelunker> @hermitdab this guy gets it
[2:15:03] <+RedMaskBandit> Theres a brief window between pancakes with slight syrup and the ones that are soggy
[2:15:11] <+TopTieramisu> crepes are also top tier
[2:15:14] <+Pleblu> mmmmmmm pancakes
[2:15:15] <%tentavision> french toast is INCREDIBLE
[2:15:15] <@CreepyPorpoise> man, I hate french toast, but its possible I've never had good french toast.
[2:15:21] <jetpack_rorschasch> Pockets do come in handy though
[2:15:24] <$Sphincter_Spelunker> @CreepyPorpoise bruh
[2:15:25] <DusK_The_Stray> French Toast gets it's own tier
[2:15:29] <$zyberion626> French toast is too decadent for me
[2:15:34] <+Pleblu> @dusk_the_stray true
[2:15:36] <%tentavision> pancake waffle and french toast are the starter Pok√©mon of breakfast
[2:15:42] <+CalderGaming> check the French toast for worms, you HAVE to
[2:15:44] <+imthewisejanitor> Sweaty pockets is a slippery slope to sweaty pussy.
[2:15:46] <$zyberion626> what? no pancakes are super easy
[2:15:51] <suddenlyscorched> Oh this is the peninsula of powerleveling
[2:15:54] <suddenlyscorched> I get it
[2:15:55] <%FacetiousAF> money
[2:15:56] <%FacetiousAF> its a money
[2:15:58] <SecondBerial> pancakes are 10000% easier
[2:16:01] <$Sphincter_Spelunker> eggs, vanilla, cinnamon + bread. bam french toast
[2:16:03] <%Jackgar> OKay now go fight the giant bird :D
[2:16:05] <hermitdab> sweaty pussy the GOAT no CAP
[2:16:07] <%Jackgar> (Do not do this)
[2:16:11] <+barkon345> pancakes made from homemade batter is super tough to make
[2:16:13] <+TopTieramisu> waffles require their own tool. it's biggest downfall
[2:16:15] <jetpack_rorschasch> Pancakes are the easiest by far.
[2:16:17] <+TopTieramisu> its*
[2:16:24] <Kain5707> early stream PogChamp
[2:16:29] <@SoFarFetched> yeah pancakes you can accidentally burn
[2:16:30] <%FingaLights> no
[2:16:35] <DusK_The_Stray> Manually insert the pockets into the Waffle
[2:16:35] <Arancet> good pancakes require technique and practice
[2:16:38] <SecondBerial> all of em are easy, but pancakes require less prep imo
[2:16:38] <Psyramics> wait, are we comparing home made pancakes to frozen waffles?
[2:16:40] <%Jackgar> Soulunes
[2:16:42] <%Jackgar> Roules
[2:16:45] <+bromontana> plus you can make sick art out of pancakes
[2:16:46] <+cvp5127> coke
[2:16:47] <%AMajorTom> That has not been my experience. Pancakes are super easy. Waffles require special equipment
[2:16:50] <$Sphincter_Spelunker> the first pancake is always a mulligan
[2:16:54] <Grethe_B> aaah peach D: Yhe tough choice between waffles and pancakes! I wish you could have tasted pancakes with bacon bits and my grans homemade blueberry jam~ <3
[2:16:54] <+RedMaskBandit> But u can burn them in the waffle iron
[2:16:58] <$zyberion626> I dunno french toast seems a bit harder
[2:16:58] <Kain5707> doing some farming Paige?
[2:17:00] <@SoFarFetched> Also getting that perfect circle on the pancakes
[2:17:01] <SecondBerial> fair
[2:17:11] <jetpack_rorschasch> So aren‚Äôt pancakes just crepes?
[2:17:17] <+CalderGaming> WHAT
[2:17:19] <+barkon345> pancakes with anything other then just the batter are really hard to flip without breaking them.
[2:17:22] <$Sphincter_Spelunker> cmonBruh
[2:17:23] <%Jackgar> TIME FOR NEW SWORD!
[2:17:46] <$Sphincter_Spelunker> never had a savory crepe before?
[2:17:50] <%CptCreampuff16> yes
[2:17:52] <%CptCreampuff16> do it
[2:17:55] <%CptCreampuff16> you will love it
[2:17:56] <%Jackgar> DO IT!
[2:17:58] <%FingaLights> above ax
[2:17:59] <Hydrapissed> greatsword solid move set if u like it go for it
[2:18:00] <%Jackgar> But also upgrade it a bit
[2:18:01] <jetpack_rorschasch> What! As a European I‚Äôm shocked and outraged by this crepe hate!
[2:18:04] <peachy996> Had crepes once, with the cream filing... didn't like it
[2:18:15] <Angerest> You don't have the BERSERK sword?
[2:18:20] <+RedMaskBandit> Reminds me of the ''quick cake'' and pastry arguments from years ago
[2:18:22] <%Jackgar> I think they were just pointing at the bloodhound fang
[2:18:23] <SecondBerial> @peachsaliva I accidentally made beast man mad by attacking statue out front. DO NOT do that lol
[2:18:27] <@CreepyPorpoise> I'd say maybe you just had bad crepes but you're in QC so I dunno
[2:18:28] <%CptCreampuff16> do the dex
[2:18:32] <lotharrio> Cleaver looks cool.
[2:18:36] <Minorou> oh man, there's a 4-minute Thai Elden Ring commercial making the rounds on twitter and its amazing
[2:18:37] <cartakus> oof
[2:18:37] <+TopTieramisu> yeah same
[2:18:42] <%CptCreampuff16> yes
[2:18:47] <%Jackgar> 2 in dex = bloodhound fang!
[2:18:52] <Kain5707> that statue has an amazing weapon though
[2:18:53] <%Jackgar> Although you'll also want to upgrade it a bit
[2:18:55] <Hydrapissed> what weapon u going for?
[2:18:56] <%Jackgar> Yeah
[2:19:00] <cartakus> wait what statue? The bird guy?
[2:19:01] <DusK_The_Stray> Wield the mighty Bloodhound Gang
[2:19:02] <%Jackgar> BUT THE FLIP THO!
[2:19:04] <Hydrapissed> curved gs and bleed is nice
[2:19:06] <$zyberion626> try its moveset first?
[2:19:07] <@SoFarFetched> But what about Bloodhound Gang? geefSmugAF
[2:19:07] <$Sphincter_Spelunker> dex is for other weapons too
[2:19:08] <%FacetiousAF> like paige knows the weapons in the game
[2:19:10] <Hydrapissed> power stance curved gs is very fun
[2:19:14] <%Jackgar> Okay so heads up: There's a way to respec later
[2:19:17] <Psyramics> I'm still using bloodhound fang
[2:19:17] <Hydrapissed> u can two hand maybe with 31 str
[2:19:17] <+TopTieramisu> looks like paige is going full strength
[2:19:22] <Zeif00> Japanese or French crepes?
[2:19:23] <+imthewisejanitor> Two in the dex, on in the spex.
[2:19:25] <+RedMaskBandit> Hispanic crepes are okay but I dont dig sweets
[2:19:26] <hermitdab> curved bloodhound blade is dope
[2:19:30] <Hydrapissed> rayla
[2:19:34] <$Sphincter_Spelunker> dex for bows so you don't need magic?
[2:19:41] <$zyberion626> is Paige trying to one hand the grafted blade?
[2:19:41] <jetpack_rorschasch> Two in the sec and one in the bush Kappa
[2:19:42] <Hydrapissed> try the move set out
[2:19:44] <cartakus> upgrade materials are kinda of a bitch though
[2:19:44] <Hydrapissed> see if ulike it
[2:19:45] <%SveriSageAdvice> yeah the respec is soon, you can always fix it later
[2:19:45] <%Jackgar> Yeah dex is also useful for ranged weapons, this is true
[2:19:47] <$zyberion626> cause she can 2 hand it right now
[2:19:48] <%CptCreampuff16> press r2 after using L2 with bloodblade
[2:19:52] <%AncelDeLambert> noice
[2:19:56] <Jetsfantasy> Wanna know a dumb trick with the grafted blade?
[2:19:59] <+TopTieramisu> i love bloodblade
[2:20:02] <%Jackgar> That's because it's not upgraded
[2:20:04] <Hydrapissed> attack speed might go up and it has bleed
[2:20:05] <DusK_The_Stray> Upgrade it!
[2:20:08] <%Ranryu692> wow, a midday Peach stream?\
[2:20:09] <Minorou> forever in the pursuit of Big Number
[2:20:11] <$Sphincter_Spelunker> it has bleed Paige
[2:20:11] <%SveriSageAdvice> you also can change the scaling on the weapon
[2:20:13] <%Jackgar> Your current weapon is at like +5
[2:20:17] <DusK_The_Stray> Yup
[2:20:21] <%Ranryu692> with more viewers than Pat?? nice
[2:20:22] <hermitdab> beyonce that and ugrade
[2:20:26] <%CptCreampuff16> did she take off the talisman?
[2:20:32] <jetpack_rorschasch> Attack power down! TearGlove
[2:20:37] <Hydrapissed> have u swung the weapon around before this ?
[2:20:42] <%CptCreampuff16> nvm im blind
[2:20:45] <%Jackgar> Bleeding STOMPS bosses
[2:20:56] <Hydrapissed> I mean if u dont like its move set then dont bother
[2:21:10] <hermitdab> follow the L2 up to dash
[2:21:14] <%SveriSageAdvice> granted its only non-special weapons that are able to be changed for a specific scaling, i dont know if Bloodhound is special
[2:21:18] <%Jackgar> It doesn't take much FP at all
[2:21:19] <cartakus> Did paige already go to shit hole red poison area?
[2:21:19] <DusK_The_Stray> That uses FP?
[2:21:23] <Hydrapissed> the guard counter is very fast on curved swords to
[2:21:27] <%Jackgar> It takes a very small amount of FP
[2:21:27] <%AncelDeLambert> WOOOO!
[2:21:28] <%CptCreampuff16> its not showing accurate numbers
[2:21:35] <%Jackgar> And yes the guard counter is VERY good on this weapon
[2:21:36] <Hydrapissed> yah can always just grind to lol
[2:21:45] <$Sphincter_Spelunker> don't you have the thing for more FP
[2:21:51] <%Jackgar> Might want to switch back
[2:21:57] <+britishfrog> Just popping in to say hey then going to catch up on your Elden Ring vods üëã
[2:22:16] <SecondBerial> @peachsaliva the heavy follow up on that special attack is tits
[2:22:17] <Hydrapissed> 4 fp yikes lol
[2:22:19] <%SveriSageAdvice> not much more, but there's a better version later
[2:22:23] <%Jackgar> How many somber smithing stones do you have?
[2:22:26] <%AncelDeLambert> a decent chunk
[2:22:31] <Hydrapissed> yah THE DRIP is sooooo scatterd
[2:22:35] <Hydrapissed> or u gata farm for it lol
[2:22:38] <%FacetiousAF> more like british fop
[2:22:53] <Danitaras> how dare you
[2:22:56] <+britishfrog> Alright settle down @FacetiousAF
[2:23:04] <+PrimalDweeb> Try taking off your helmet, it should look a little better that way.
[2:23:06] <+barkon345> to busy playing the game
[2:23:12] <cartakus> In the poison area with the bay blade enemy statue there is a cave with a talisman that gives more runes
[2:23:17] <%FacetiousAF> sorry :/
[2:23:25] <+barkon345> who has time to do YouTube uploads
[2:23:28] <%FacetiousAF> god now i need to google that word...
[2:23:31] <%FingaLights> I love listening to them as I work, Thanks for uploading Paige!
[2:24:10] <%AncelDeLambert> Paige, I wanna ask about a popoff "wow that view" point question: have you found the bubble guys?
[2:24:15] <+PrimalDweeb> You are welcome
[2:24:18] <%SveriSageAdvice> its nice and cool to hang out here
[2:24:29] <%Bloomingzonda> I rewatch your vods when I don't feel good because they cheer me up
[2:24:33] <%AncelDeLambert> sweet
[2:24:40] <%SveriSageAdvice> oh no those guys are very far away
[2:24:48] <+PrimalDweeb> Same
[2:24:49] <+RedMaskBandit> As long as it distracts you from voreing mold
[2:25:00] <%AncelDeLambert> I'll give you a hint if you want, once you're done farming
[2:25:16] <cartakus> are you sure?
[2:25:21] <+TopTieramisu> 2 gingers 1 mold
[2:25:34] <studleydoorite> the mold?
[2:25:36] <%Jackgar> You'll never live it down
[2:25:36] <@Jekado> MOLDEN RING!
[2:25:37] <cartakus> woolie's was the best
[2:25:43] <DusK_The_Stray> The mold added spice
[2:25:45] <%FacetiousAF> oh... kay...
[2:25:46] <cartakus> wtf
[2:25:47] <DusK_The_Stray> Whaaat?
[2:25:51] <$zyberion626> it's because you check your hamburgers for worms
[2:25:56] <+imthewisejanitor> Paige. LUL
[2:25:56] <$mattwillpost> I love twitter for getting IRATE for WHAT
[2:25:59] <%SweetCheeksTVR> SweetCheeksTVR subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 15 months, currently on a 12 month streak! Why would people think you ate your dog?????
[2:26:03] <+TopTieramisu> potato salad would be a cute dog name
[2:26:04] <%FingaLights> You didn't have a dog at the time tho, right?
[2:26:09] <$zyberion626> twitter is a strange and silly place
[2:26:10] <+imthewisejanitor> Why would you eat your moldy dog????
[2:26:11] <nip_nips> you DIDNT eat the dog?
[2:26:14] <+RedMaskBandit> But it happens on more than one occasion lol
[2:26:15] <+barkon345> I like going back and watching some of her old vods, particularly the Baba is You and the blood bourne vods
[2:26:19] <%Jackgar> I mean I was mad because you were eating mold, but not because of the dog thing, that's weird
[2:26:22] <studleydoorite> why does twitter ever attempt thinking
[2:26:23] <%SveriSageAdvice> oh no, i remember exactly how you phrased it, you described taking care of Zangief and then collapsing and eating the mold
[2:26:26] <Kain5707> what drugs are people on these days
[2:26:45] <%Jellly_> Jellly_ subscribed with Prime. They've subscribed for 2 months, currently on a 1 month streak! 
[2:26:47] <cartakus> Sanic life
[2:26:52] <+TopTieramisu> @Kain5707 elden ring
[2:26:57] <OldOnyx> it was more mold than salad
[2:27:08] <%VentWilsn> mold salad
[2:27:12] <%VentWilsn> YUMMY YUMMY
[2:27:14] <%SveriSageAdvice> it was baffling they somehow strung together you eating mold for eating Zangief
[2:27:22] <+TopTieramisu> mold with a side of potato
[2:27:30] <%Jackgar> I guess seeing all the fungus in this zone must be making you very hungry
[2:27:40] <%tentavision> Who?
[2:27:41] <%FacetiousAF> pat is... IN THERE based on the amount of time he's spent
[2:27:45] <%VentWilsn> "would you like some salad with ur mold, ma'am?"
[2:27:47] <jetpack_rorschasch> Twitter is a degenerate hellscape, don‚Äôt take it to heart.
[2:27:52] <%Bloomingzonda> We are here for the mustard queen
[2:27:58] <cartakus> yup
[2:28:01] <%FingaLights> I like Farm n Chill
[2:28:04] <nip_nips> im here for the out of context quotes
[2:28:16] <%Jackgar> I bet when he's asleep you can hear him go "oooooooooo, Elden Riiiiiing"
[2:28:25] <DusK_The_Stray> It's more the fucking insanity of the logic. Twitter is nuts
[2:28:27] <%Lunarclock> i love twitter
[2:28:33] <%Lunarclock> it's so funny
[2:28:34] <$Sphincter_Spelunker> guts sword ghost
[2:28:36] <cartakus> I hare teitter
[2:28:49] <+imthewisejanitor> It's okat, because Twitter isn't a real place.
[2:28:52] <+imthewisejanitor> okay*
[2:28:58] <cartakus> And i also cant read
[2:29:02] <%Lunarclock> i mean on a fundamental level i hate twitter. but it's all so surreal that it's entertaining nonetheless
[2:29:22] <%Bloomingzonda> This game is a lot of fun to watch different people play becuase it can be so extremely different. I have been keeping up on you, Pat, Plague, and Northernlion and they are all radically different playthroughs
[2:29:28] <%FingaLights> Hare Teitter is kinda a cool name tho @cartakus
[2:29:55] <+TopTieramisu> pat and NL are like opposites in a lot of ways
[2:30:08] <+TopTieramisu> pat is obsessively completionist and NL is blind
[2:30:35] <%VentWilsn> NL?
[2:30:39] <+TopTieramisu> northernlion
[2:30:42] <%Jackgar> I know a lot of people for who this is their first Souls game
[2:30:52] <%Lunarclock> This game is like if BotW hated you a liiiiiiittle more than usual
[2:30:55] <%Jackgar> And people who don't normally like Souls games but are loving this
[2:30:57] <OldOnyx> Dragons Dogma 2 has a lot to compete with
[2:31:07] <+TopTieramisu> yote
[2:31:07] <@Jekado> REPPUKEN
[2:31:08] <+barkon345> the problem is it doesn't have the casual appeal of skyrim
[2:31:12] <%Lunarclock> Yeowch!
[2:31:13] <TheZearGuy> This looks like a pretty good farming spot. Just randomly got to this zone yesterday.
[2:31:15] <+TopTieramisu> dubbo reppuken
[2:31:20] <%VentWilsn> this is definitely a video game marvel
[2:31:28] <Psyramics> I dunno, until you can mod in Thomas the Tank Engine to replace a dragon
[2:31:28] <+barkon345> people who don't even play bideo games were playing skyrim
[2:31:31] <+TopTieramisu> this is miyazaki's masterpiece
[2:31:39] <jetpack_rorschasch> I guess we‚Äôll have to wait until 2030 until we can say that Kappa
[2:31:44] <DusK_The_Stray> It's odd to me that BotW and Skyrim both didn't click with me and I love this game. Only played like an hour of Soulsborne total before
[2:31:49] <+barkon345> video games
[2:31:55] <+imthewisejanitor> "I think this might be game of the deaca- shit ass balls on my tits!"
[2:32:07] <+TopTieramisu> it is pretty early in the decade
[2:32:16] <+RedMaskBandit> An open world game of Dark 3 where its very forgiving
[2:32:26] <$Sphincter_Spelunker> so was Skyrim
[2:32:28] <kurono_alt> The Elden Ring hype got to me so I decided I should start with Dark Souls. so I've been playing DS Remastered
[2:32:28] <%Jackgar> DUNKED
[2:32:31] <%rumtumtugnutz> Oh yeah, this can't be a Darksouls sequel cause you can jump
[2:32:35] <%Jackgar> And there it is
[2:32:37] <+TopTieramisu> oof
[2:32:41] <%FingaLights> @DusK_The_Stray Interesting. have you tried Witcher 3?
[2:32:43] <%FacetiousAF> great content, paige
[2:32:44] <cartakus> F
[2:32:46] <Angerest> 2015-2025 is a decade
[2:32:53] <+TopTieramisu> it's a sekisoulsborne in one game
[2:32:55] <+barkon345> @DusK_The_Stray this game is a lot better then both of those games.
[2:32:57] <ReenBenkyou> unlucky
[2:32:57] <%VentWilsn> just like how ratchet and clank PS5 had GRAPHICS and NO LOADING SCREENS
[2:33:15] <%Jackgar> I probably should try thatt game
[2:33:17] <%Bloomingzonda> I think people are just hungry for an open world RPG. The only well reviewed one since FF15 in 2016 is Outer Worlds
[2:33:19] <@Jekado> game of the decade?  but its early in the decade what if there was an elden ring 2?
[2:33:22] <+imthewisejanitor> This is wonderful content, keep it up!
[2:33:29] <@Jekado> we still have like 8 years
[2:33:32] <%Jackgar> What's funny is you know what game is coming out this month?
[2:33:34] <%Jackgar> KILL CHAOS
[2:33:41] <%VentWilsn> its definitely nominee for game of the year already
[2:33:43] <@Jekado> i mean its good
[2:33:45] <%Jackgar> It's gonna be real funny playing that game after this
[2:33:45] <Danitaras> Elden Ring 2: Mo maidens, mo problems
[2:34:02] <DusK_The_Stray> @FingaLights No, I think it's cool but not enough for me to want to play it.
[2:34:02] <%rumtumtugnutz> Elden Ring 2: Electric Boogaloo
[2:34:05] <+barkon345> the thing is I don't feel like this game is as groundbreaking as the original darksouls
[2:34:06] <+imthewisejanitor> Soulsy-er
[2:34:06] <+CalderGaming> Wowee
[2:34:10] <cartakus> I'm more interest in garland guy than the game
[2:34:15] <Kain5707> just think of how amazing of a base this game is for more content/new souls games
[2:34:16] <@Jekado> REMEMBER FINAL FANTASY FIRST SOLDIER IS COMING OUT SOON that could be game of the decade geefBlank
[2:34:16] <%Jackgar> I mean this game is VERY good, and it's ridiculous how much content there is
[2:34:18] <+RedMaskBandit> Its only 2022 so maybe its a stretch but i will agree that its one of the best for the PS5 gen
[2:34:20] <+TopTieramisu> this game is important in helping pat get over grrm
[2:34:32] <+TopTieramisu> not finishing asoiaf
[2:34:32] <DusK_The_Stray> @barkon345 That's fair, I certainly enjoy it more than those two.
[2:34:36] <+imthewisejanitor> Nothing wrong with having an early contender.
[2:34:41] <Angerest> HUGE best of
[2:34:46] <%rumtumtugnutz> Final Fantasy isn;t going to touch a real Soulsborne.
[2:34:48] <%Jackgar> That all being said, as much as I love these games....please, please make a new Armored Core, Fromsoftware. I miss my Raven
[2:34:49] <%VentWilsn> "IT BROKE NEW GROUND" LUL
[2:35:03] <%FingaLights> It's FromSoft Best of,
[2:35:06] <%Jackgar> IT TOOK TWELVE YEARS TO MAKE
[2:35:13] <+CalderGaming> btw public service message: some of those little guys (Vulgar Militants) have a sickle and chain weapon... they won't ever drop one for you to use, so don't commit time to farming for one
[2:35:24] <jetpack_rorschasch> It‚Äôs so far the pinnacle of souls games though, so it‚Äôs at least the most ‚Äúimportant‚Äù souls game in the last decade.
[2:35:26] <+barkon345> no I agree it's everything that made darksouls great perfected
[2:35:27] <%Jackgar> Nah I'm doing a Red Letter Media meme
[2:35:29] <SecondBerial> @peachsaliva if you upgrade your sword one more time, you'll be one shotting those guys with the backstab
[2:35:33] <odnucaf3> @imthewisejanitor This is the real ending of GOT.
[2:35:35] <+TopTieramisu> this is fromsoft combining all the lessons it learned from its previous titles + botw
[2:35:38] <%Jackgar> Since someone else did "IT BROKE NEW GROUND"
[2:35:41] <+imthewisejanitor> "You've had spaghetti, but you've never had my GRANDMA'S spaghetti."
[2:35:49] <Kain5707> Paige what stats are you focusing on the most?
[2:35:57] <+RedMaskBandit> Honestly I feel that the FF series is hardy to get into
[2:35:57] <%Jackgar> This game didn't actually take 12 years....probably
[2:36:01] <cartakus> I just wish there was a flail weapon that was for str build
[2:36:09] <+TopTieramisu> this build goes brrrrrr
[2:36:11] <jetpack_rorschasch> IT BROKE NEW GROUND! - Mike
[2:36:22] <%Jackgar> @cartakus Yeah it is weird that flails are all dex
[2:36:22] <Kain5707> oh there is so many amazing STR/DEX weapons youre going to be very happy
[2:36:25] <+TopTieramisu> i wonder if rich evans is playing this game
[2:36:48] <%Jackgar> All the best STR weapons need some DEX and vice-versa
[2:37:16] <%Bloomingzonda> Dark Souls also got more popular as time went on. It got over shadowed the year it came out by Skyrim, LA Noire, Portal 2, and Deus Ex Human Revolution. It got big off Lets Plays
[2:37:17] <+CalderGaming> @cartakus chain link flail carried by some Pumpkin Heads
[2:37:20] <%Jackgar> Ah yes, the legendary stream where they got Mike to play a video game: Don't Shit Your Pants
[2:37:21] <OldOnyx> @Jackgar did those leaked screenshots of of new AC in early production turn out to be a hoax?
[2:37:23] <$Sphincter_Spelunker> the weirdo, yeah
[2:37:25] <+imthewisejanitor> Rich Evans is a national treasure.
[2:37:28] <+TopTieramisu> @Jackgar that was wonderful
[2:37:38] <%Jackgar> @OldOnyx I don't think we know either way yet
[2:38:00] <%Bloomingzonda> @PeachSaliva Jack from RLM has been playing Elden Ring on The Escapists youtube
[2:38:03] <cartakus> I got that one, it's ugly as shit though. Is paige fighting the night riders?
[2:38:06] <%FingaLights> Hope they know it wasn't you
[2:38:12] <@Jekado> annoyed they don't go down in one backstab... stupid magic pixel of health
[2:38:17] <jetpack_rorschasch> It‚Äôs a shame he stoped doing those game streams. I miss them.
[2:38:24] <+barkon345> I had him screaming oh my go as my notification sound for like 2 days
[2:38:36] <cartakus> I really like the nazgul guys
[2:38:42] <$hewlettfan96> Me too
[2:38:44] <+barkon345> I wanted to keep it longer bit people were getting pissed off at me
[2:38:52] <lethallylactic> He's standing there...MENACINGLY
[2:38:54] <$hewlettfan96> Hey how do I stop my cat from smelling so bad
[2:39:01] <+TopTieramisu> is jack loving elden ring?
[2:39:01] <%rumtumtugnutz> Don't Shit Your Pants deserves a AAA sequel.
[2:39:02] <%Jackgar> Sometimes a man's just gotta go out and do some howling
[2:39:10] <+TopTieramisu> it seems right up both jack and rich's alley
[2:39:13] <%Jackgar> Oops
[2:39:13] <lethallylactic> I love the special downward stab for these short enemies LUL
[2:39:14] <%Jackgar> OOPS!
[2:39:20] <$Sphincter_Spelunker> we know
[2:39:25] <+barkon345> do they still stream? or do anything game related anymore?
[2:39:31] <Hydrapissed> im telling
[2:39:33] <cartakus> I also did lol
[2:39:33] <%FingaLights> I did too
[2:39:34] <+TopTieramisu> jack does gaming content for escapist
[2:39:38] <%VentWilsn> sipsipSipsipblind sipsipSipsipblind
[2:39:39] <heartlesshealer> hi~mi~tsu~
[2:39:41] <+CalderGaming> ngl I thought those formations were enemies at first too
[2:39:44] <%rumtumtugnutz> It's his turn to play with the ring.
[2:39:46] <$hewlettfan96> His arse fucking reeks, and do t know what to f√©e ship anymore
[2:39:50] <%Bloomingzonda> @barkon345 Jack works for Escapist and does stuff
[2:39:53] <$hewlettfan96> Feed him
[2:39:54] <%wizard_of_diamonds> wizard_of_diamonds subscribed with Prime. 
[2:39:54] <jetpack_rorschasch> ‚ÄúThe Man‚Äù Kappa
[2:39:59] <+barkon345> @peachsaliva when is the last time you went for an eye exam
[2:40:03] <$hewlettfan96> Whoooooa
[2:40:07] <$hewlettfan96> That‚Äôs cool
[2:40:10] <cartakus> That dragon is easier than he seems
[2:40:12] <%FacetiousAF> now paige is just missing Wizard of Gold
[2:40:13] <%wizard_of_diamonds> Big and Strong
[2:40:18] <%rumtumtugnutz> @barkon345 Like six months ago?
[2:40:45] <heartlesshealer> yeah late last year, and Pat bemoaned Paige's ability to correctly guess her prescription again
[2:40:48] <%Jackgar> I'm glad The Escapist got rid of the shittier parts of leadership and are putting out good stuff again
[2:40:50] <+TopTieramisu> i was so freaked out when i first got to this place
[2:40:52] <$hewlettfan96> Haven‚Äôt u ever used kiwi farms Paige
[2:40:53] <ReenBenkyou> That reminds me, I gotta get new glasses. It's getting hard to see in class.
[2:40:54] <%FacetiousAF> :/
[2:40:55] <%FacetiousAF> paige.
[2:41:06] <+TopTieramisu> and now i'm watching a chill stream just farming here
[2:41:15] <%Bloomingzonda> BTW Paige because I wasd rewatching your stuff I discovered that people started reminding you to go to the eye doctor early in the DARK SOULS 2 PLAYTHROUGH
[2:41:29] <%Jackgar> While you're farming in-game, I'm farming IRL by having this on the background of my workout! Today is heavy pause squats!
[2:41:53] <$hewlettfan96> I need glasses yet I haven‚Äôt worn mine properly in 2 years, my right eye has actually gotten worse for not wearing them, it sucks
[2:42:14] <%FacetiousAF> :/ the fuckin racists are still at it?
[2:42:28] <%Jackgar> It helps to have a home gym setup. But yeah, it can be tough with a bad back
[2:42:29] <%FacetiousAF> sorry *Xenophobes
[2:42:32] <+TopTieramisu> monkaS
[2:42:36] <cartakus> oh the french?
[2:42:36] <%rumtumtugnutz> @Bloomingzonda I've been a patron of Peach for just over 3 years and people gave been telling her to go see the eye doctor since at least three months before that.
[2:42:38] <%AncelDeLambert> amazing how fast The Tarnished can duck walk
[2:42:39] <heartlesshealer> oh yeah you guys get ground ice over there
[2:42:45] <%FacetiousAF> you can dunk on people. rad.
[2:42:57] <%Jackgar> I know some good training programs for lower back pain rehab but obviously doctor's orders come first
[2:43:02] <%FingaLights> I thought that said Vulgar Manlett Gauntlets LUL
[2:43:04] <$hewlettfan96> I‚Äôm sorry your in so much pAin most of the time paige, that can‚Äôt Be fun wishing you well!! <3
[2:43:08] <heartlesshealer> ice is always danger
[2:43:10] <%Jackgar> Yeah fuck that guy, he sounds like a psycho
[2:43:28] <%wizard_of_diamonds> Damn, that's fucked up
[2:43:35] <+TopTieramisu> that's some extreme insecurity
[2:43:38] <$hewlettfan96> Lupus must suck, my aunt has it, do you have a metal disc in your spine
[2:43:53] <%Jackgar> Apparently a lot of that comes from residual anger at the English
[2:43:59] <+barkon345> @heartlesshealer the rocks later poured to melt that ice is a lot worse
[2:44:11] <%Jackgar> Which I can understand
[2:44:15] <Zeif00> To take all that shit out on you is unacceptable
[2:44:21] <heartlesshealer> you can understand, but also understand that the solution was an overreaction doing the exact same wrong that was done to them
[2:44:28] <jetpack_rorschasch> Sorry guys, but what happened about the guy screaming at Paige? Please inform me.
[2:44:34] <cartakus> ooooooof
[2:44:47] <+barkon345> @heartlesshealer *rock salt
[2:44:50] <%CptCreampuff16> dex
[2:44:54] <%Jackgar> One more dex for the weapon!
[2:44:57] <$hewlettfan96> Do you need to take pain meds?
[2:45:07] <Aussie_Manny> None of our business, that's what.
[2:45:07] <$Sphincter_Spelunker> @jetpack_rorschasch xenophobic neighbors don't like the English language and screamed at her
[2:45:13] <%rumtumtugnutz> @jetpack_rorschasch Pat and Paige were talking on their porch in english and a neighbour started screaming at them that they had no right to speak English.
[2:45:15] <%FingaLights> Are there any therapy exercises for it?
[2:45:18] <%Jackgar> You should probably upgrade it a little first
[2:45:22] <heartlesshealer> @barkon345 That makes more sense. A layer of essentially sand on top until it melts doesn't help well for driving
[2:45:24] <%rumtumtugnutz> And he used to be a nice neighbour if I recall
[2:45:25] <$hewlettfan96> Is there anyway to remove it completely? Like get surgery
[2:45:35] <%Jackgar> It's not going to do as much damage as the sword you were doing without upgrades
[2:45:35] <Druss_M> You see, the mistake was going outside
[2:45:40] <%CptCreampuff16> try the L2 plus R2 now it should be different
[2:46:05] <$Sphincter_Spelunker> "I have to yell at you in English so you can understand. No it's not a double standard."
[2:46:08] <%FacetiousAF> blood psaGib
[2:46:09] <$hewlettfan96> Maybe he was in crack cocaine
[2:46:26] <%Jackgar> Did you see that big sudden chunk of damage? That's you inflicting bleed
[2:46:27] <%FingaLights> Bleed is big good
[2:46:35] <$hewlettfan96> Jesus why????
[2:46:54] <$hewlettfan96> Maybe he was mad, poor guy hope he gets some help
[2:46:56] <%Jackgar> You could probably get this sword up to +2 or +3 right now and it will make a big difference
[2:47:00] <%rumtumtugnutz> Quebecois are very *very8 defensive of their culture.
[2:47:01] <%FacetiousAF> guess you should carry a knife Kappa
[2:47:06] <%FingaLights> was he old and or short?
[2:47:14] <+barkon345> what about that guy who reached into your car window and grabbed the steering wheel while you were trying to park
[2:47:17] <Zeif00> You said one of the other neighbors saw it happen?
[2:47:29] <tuesti> he def is a wackadoodle
[2:47:41] <jetpack_rorschasch> Umm.. even if it‚Äôs a regional thing you were still in the right Paige. He confronted you for no reason other than being a nationalist asshole. Fuck‚Äôem! DansGame
[2:47:42] <$hewlettfan96> He probably has a mental illness like schizophrenia, maybe you just triggered him
[2:47:54] <+barkon345> you have got some crazy people up near you
[2:47:55] <%rumtumtugnutz> I have friends who live in Montreal who tell me they get similar treatment.
[2:47:57] <Psyramics> and none of them got involved
[2:47:59] <Druss_M> Yeah Def a nationalist Qubec
[2:48:01] <+TopTieramisu> good to know it's not everyone there
[2:48:05] <southpawlynx> Seems legitimately traumatizing
[2:48:08] <Druss_M> F
[2:48:08] <+TopTieramisu> LUL
[2:48:08] <+SpareKeese> Very glad the neighbors sided/agreed with you
[2:48:11] <Danitaras> lol
[2:48:12] <%maskofmichael> You live in a society
[2:48:12] <%FacetiousAF> alright 5 pushups
[2:48:14] <Aussie_Manny> f
[2:48:15] <+barkon345> lmao
[2:48:15] <%FingaLights> OHNNOP
[2:48:19] <$hewlettfan96> Maybe you mis gendered him that‚Äôs why he got mad
[2:48:25] <+barkon345> lol that scream
[2:48:28] <+Walopoh> Nothing excuses being nationalistic trash
[2:48:30] <heartlesshealer> hewlett
[2:48:31] <$hewlettfan96> Shitting your pants??
[2:48:32] <%Jackgar> sipsipSipsipblind
[2:48:39] <$Sphincter_Spelunker> @hewlettfan96 nah, there's loads of people like that in Qubec. There's even videos of confrontations on youtube
[2:48:48] <Druss_M> You should apologise for him being french
[2:48:59] <+SpareKeese> You're nice tho
[2:49:02] <%wizard_of_diamonds> What on earth could you possibly be instigating
[2:49:06] <%Jackgar> There is a whole political party up there just for Quebec separatists
[2:49:10] <Aussie_Manny> OhMyDog ROHROHROH ROH ROHROH
[2:49:14] <%FingaLights> Paige has that Witches Curse, she draws agro everywhere
[2:49:16] <$hewlettfan96> @sphincter_spelunker Lol why?? There‚Äôs a lot of people who randomly scream at people a lot
[2:49:21] <GigaBombPlays> Most people who talk for a living are really quiet when they're off the clock so that makes sense for streamers
[2:49:24] <+SpareKeese> Why would anyone think you're instagatory?
[2:49:24] <+Derupiko> respectfully respectful
[2:49:28] <+Walopoh> I can tell just from how self-conscious you are that you aren't that kind of person
[2:49:32] <%FacetiousAF> INSTIGATE WALKING DOWN THE STREET
[2:49:35] <%rumtumtugnutz> A guy I went to school with is a doctor in Montreal, and there are people who have vandalized his clinic because he's English
[2:49:35] <$hewlettfan96> For being respectful??
[2:49:37] <%rumtumtugnutz> So like
[2:49:37] <%FacetiousAF> fuckin loons
[2:49:40] <%CptCreampuff16> try the L2 plus R2
[2:49:51] <$Sphincter_Spelunker> @hewlettfan96 no, I mean for literally speaking English. Confrontations over that
[2:49:53] <Druss_M> The exaggerated swagger of the English
[2:49:55] <%rumtumtugnutz> This whole 'Quebec nationalists are douchebags' thing is 100% true.
[2:50:03] <cartakus> Stand users are draw to each other
[2:50:07] <jetpack_rorschasch> People have been using nationalism as an excuse for being pieces of human garbage. You honestly did nothing wrong.
[2:50:09] <+TopTieramisu> nationalists in general
[2:50:18] <$hewlettfan96> @sphincter_spelunker Why?? That‚Äôs so dumb? Why would you take offence for someone not speaking in your dialect?
[2:50:23] <+Derupiko> Paige is big and strong and he got intimidated
[2:50:33] <Zeif00> I remember you guys saying you were planning on moving, that still on the table?
[2:50:48] <Danitaras> i remember how upset the quebecois were on twitter, point proven
[2:50:49] <%CptCreampuff16> if youre farming i think you can 2 hand the big big sword
[2:50:52] <%FingaLights> My PC works fine, no issue here. Must be you
[2:51:03] <%Jackgar> From what I understand it doesn't get like that guy until you get further out from the center of the city?
[2:51:10] <heartlesshealer> yeah, quebecois twitter was nuts
[2:51:12] <+imthewisejanitor> "It never happened to me, therefore it never happens to anyone."
[2:51:13] <%rumtumtugnutz> @hewlettfan96 It's because Quebec has laws to defend theuse of the French language to protect their culture, and people use that to be dickheads.
[2:51:13] <$hewlettfan96> Do you think it was racism that got him mad??
[2:51:13] <$Chatterbox1991> And of course you had that super racist guy going on some hyper disturbing anti-black tirade right in the middle of that
[2:51:23] <%wizard_of_diamonds> Ah Canada, famous bastion of racial tolerance, would never have a problem with an immigrant speaking a different language Kappa
[2:51:28] <$Chatterbox1991> (fuck that guy ftr)
[2:51:31] <%Jackgar> I have co-workers in Montreal so I hear about this a little bit
[2:51:35] <$Sphincter_Spelunker> @hewlettfan96 Not from here mentality. God forbid you be 2nd Gen and born there. Only need to "look" different
[2:51:37] <SecondBerial> it happens here in the US too. the nationalists that get infuriated over hearing people speaking Spanish. same thing.
[2:51:43] <%FacetiousAF> @wizard_of_diamonds totally love and respect their indigenous populations too
[2:51:51] <+pkmamsters> "I've never experienced prejudice and therefore it doesn't exist." is a hell of a point for some weirdos to make
[2:51:59] <$hewlettfan96> @rumtumtugnutz I see, are the french there just very protective and nationalistic in taht way?
[2:52:14] <+Walopoh> People that instigate shit often lack self-awareness in any ways, but your entire personality and comedy has always been VERY self-aware. We knew it wasn't because of you LUL
[2:52:15] <%CptCreampuff16> i meant the bigger sword that takes 40 str i think you can two hand it with your current stats
[2:52:42] <Aussie_Manny> OhMyDog ROHROHROH ROH ROHROH
[2:52:42] <$hewlettfan96> I‚Äôm sorry you have so many weirdos in your neighbourhood Paige
[2:52:49] <+Walopoh> Doesn't excuse being an asshole
[2:52:56] <$Chatterbox1991> you are cool!
[2:52:58] <GigaBombPlays> They shouldn't give you shit for that. You're making an attempt. That deserves praise not animosity.
[2:53:00] <heartlesshealer> I'm glad the other neighbors were cool about it with you
[2:53:07] <$hewlettfan96> psaDogchamp ROHROHROHROH *dripping gowl sound*
[2:53:17] <%FingaLights> @SecondBerial yep, totally. Feel like you can find that anywhere, just more in some places than others. Humans are weird
[2:53:21] <SecondBerial> you're super cool and big. not to mention strong
[2:53:23] <%wizard_of_diamonds> I feel so bad for Paige, and I'd talk more shit but I'm American lmao
[2:53:25] <%CopperTucker> Don't make excuses for assholes. They can all go suck it.
[2:53:32] <+TopTieramisu> is being bothered by non-perfect speaking of the language a french thing?
[2:53:33] <+imthewisejanitor> All it takes is one guy.
[2:53:47] <%CopperTucker> @TopTieramisu no, it's an American thing too.
[2:53:50] <+cvp5127> did he poop his pants
[2:53:55] <%FingaLights> Understanding is not the same as excusing
[2:53:56] <$hewlettfan96> Perhaps but it just doesn‚Äôt give them an excuse to be a dick like taht
[2:53:57] <%FacetiousAF> pat the huge baby
[2:53:59] <%Sotetsu> Hopping mad
[2:54:06] <+CalderGaming> hopefully we can all take this opportunity to reflect on how people get treated for not speaking our own languages perfectly in our own home countries
[2:54:12] <+TopTieramisu> @TopTieramisu i guess. depends on where
[2:54:14] <%rumtumtugnutz> Seriously, though, Canadians are not as nice as people like to portray them.
[2:54:24] <$hewlettfan96> He must‚Äôve looked like a cartoon character
[2:54:28] <+Walopoh> The history is fucked, but again if you attack somebody for their language THAT is what started this whole problem LUL
[2:54:40] <jetpack_rorschasch> Outsider/insider bullshit is an excuse to abuse other people for a sick sense of catharsis. That guy sounded like he was venting his personal shit. DansGame
[2:54:41] <SolumFuturae> oh god
[2:54:49] <$hewlettfan96> Paige didn‚Äôt you literally nearly poop yourself once??
[2:54:49] <+CalderGaming> I remember the Quebec nationalist Twitter backlash
[2:54:52] <SecondBerial> @fingalights I remember being really young and finding out OTHER countries have racist ppl in then too. blew my mind for some reason
[2:55:06] <Aussie_Manny> Just put your phone to your ear, and say "Hello, police?", and crazies like that might have enough sense to leave.
[2:55:10] <%Sotetsu> I've never met a nationalist, from any country, that I've liked.
[2:55:18] <heartlesshealer> oh yeah that fucking weirdo who digs through lady posts
[2:55:22] <Danitaras> ah yes the asian thing?
[2:55:35] <cartakus> Paige's agenda against the canada
[2:55:38] <Angerest> 1 out of MILLIONS could not be a bad apple, for SHAME
[2:55:38] <%VentWilsn> dont worry about it, my friend is Portuguese but hasn't learn how to speak the language. So he can understand like 20% of what his step mom says
[2:55:42] <jetpack_rorschasch> Fuck those nationalists! DansGame
[2:55:50] <$Sphincter_Spelunker> cherry picking arguments is a symptom of being terminally online
[2:55:52] <$hewlettfan96> @sotetsu Nationalism doesn‚Äôt mean racist/ facist, that‚Äôs too much of absolutist generalisation
[2:56:02] <+TopTieramisu> monkaS
[2:56:04] <+SpareKeese> UUUUH
[2:56:04] <%FacetiousAF> RUH ROH
[2:56:04] <Joco2222> yikes
[2:56:06] <+ThomasOfTroy> Oh yeah, you mentioned this
[2:56:09] <+cvp5127> thats too much effort
[2:56:10] <Zeif00> ew
[2:56:10] <%FingaLights> @SecondBerial I KNOW!!! It's so strange! It's both comforting and horrifying
[2:56:12] <+SpareKeese> Yikes
[2:56:16] <$hewlettfan96> Jesus
[2:56:16] <%Jackgar> UUUUUUGH
[2:56:17] <$zyberion626> Jesus H. Christ.
[2:56:19] <SecondBerial> big fucking oof
[2:56:24] <tuesti> oh my goood
[2:56:24] <$hewlettfan96> Ughhhhhh
[2:56:27] <%Sotetsu> Casual racism is always awkward.
[2:56:30] <%AncelDeLambert> well that's icky
[2:56:36] <Aussie_Manny> Those kinds of racists are a dying breed.
[2:56:39] <RickyRelucent> i'm a nationalist, i am against the state and i for liberties. theres racist on both sides
[2:56:40] <%rumtumtugnutz> I remember you telling this story.
[2:56:41] <+storebrandcandy> nah bro, nah
[2:56:42] <RickyRelucent> did i pass
[2:56:42] <+Walopoh> Wait tweeting about that is what they used to say YOU had "an agenda"?
[2:56:46] <jetpack_rorschasch> Oh no‚Ä¶ oh no no no!
[2:56:47] <$hewlettfan96> Casually racism how charming
[2:56:55] <$zyberion626> "This lady is American! Surely she'll appreciate CASUAL RACISM!"
[2:57:06] <+pkmamsters> "Oh you know..." and then he bucks his teeth and wears a rice hat
[2:57:06] <%Nordguy> lol ibwould not want to own that if i was quebeqois
[2:57:07] <cartakus> oof
[2:57:11] <%Jackgar> What are you upgrade materials looking like?
[2:57:12] <SecondBerial> just be like "what? I don't get it?" watch em squirm
[2:57:16] <Angerest> get into Competitive racism
[2:57:18] <%AncelDeLambert> "just admit you're racist towards the French, this example of not tolerating racism towards Asians proves it"
[2:57:20] <%Jackgar> Also if you want the BIG BIG sword eventually, that's 40 STR
[2:57:22] <$hewlettfan96> He seems like the guy who would scream the N word in a California suburb to see it‚Äôs effect
[2:57:26] <+TopTieramisu> how is that an example of an agenda?
[2:57:42] <%Sotetsu> meowriiiCopium
[2:57:47] <RickyRelucent> how can one not be racist vs france
[2:57:53] <heartlesshealer> Just Farm Later‚Ñ¢
[2:57:53] <RickyRelucent> honhon
[2:57:55] <%Jackgar> Yeah the best way to deal with folks like that is to get them to force them to explain themselves
[2:58:11] <%tentavision> i would have expected the US to be the ones inventing new weird types of racism
[2:58:13] <%FacetiousAF> that's not how lying works
[2:58:13] <%CptCreampuff16> these enemies are weak you can test the blood sword against them if you want
[2:58:17] <$hewlettfan96> There was actually a guy who did that at the black Panther premiere who screamed a racial slur and was nearly beaten to death by the ensuing riot
[2:58:17] <%Jackgar> Do you have any somber smithing stones?
[2:58:19] <%rumtumtugnutz> HONH HONH BAGUETTE
[2:58:19] <%wizard_of_diamonds> That wouldn't even be an agenda lmao.
[2:58:21] <%FingaLights> How dare you talk about bad experiences you've had
[2:58:28] <RickyRelucent> good take away
[2:58:29] <%Nordguy> if i was high out of my mind i woulda shouted doc out for being racist and blame it on the drugs after
[2:58:30] <heartlesshealer> It's just that the average to good times aren't notable enough to tweet about because they were benign, dude
[2:58:36] <$Sphincter_Spelunker> the big curved sword
[2:58:39] <%FacetiousAF> you stopped talking about life because some psycho nationalists want blood
[2:58:39] <%CptCreampuff16> blood hound fang
[2:58:47] <cartakus> @hewlettfan96 fuck around and find out I guess...
[2:58:48] <%rumtumtugnutz> It's almost like bad experiences color perception.
[2:58:49] <%Jackgar> The sword with the flippy move
[2:58:50] <$hewlettfan96> French people are very casually  rude I‚Äôve heard it‚Äôs just accepted
[2:58:57] <Joco2222> dude, I'm a Filipino in Alberta and work at a tech store, pretty much white anglo people doing eyes or speaking any asian language to me out of nowhere is every second day
[2:58:57] <%FingaLights> It's the curved sword that can make you flip
[2:59:03] <leinadtonu> So if I'm getting this right Paidge is an infiltrated gent trying to destroy the french part of Canada...
[2:59:05] <heartlesshealer> wow
[2:59:08] <RickyRelucent> just do like philosophes
[2:59:09] <%Jackgar> RIP
[2:59:13] <%Jackgar> IT'S SO COOL
[2:59:16] <RickyRelucent> philofiser?
[2:59:18] <%CptCreampuff16> press r2 after backflipp for blink
[2:59:19] <RickyRelucent> dont discuss it
[2:59:20] <jetpack_rorschasch> You can see their bias with the way they construct this fantasy about you Paige. It just proves you‚Äôre in the right.
[2:59:20] <SecondBerial> oh dude I was in the hospital for 2 ulcers last month and the nurse that let me under for the endoscopy had her mask down and breathing in my face right before i was put under
[2:59:22] <heartlesshealer> just destroyed that man
[2:59:31] <$hewlettfan96> @cartakus Well he did in the worst way possible lol
[2:59:33] <%Jackgar> Yeah do the L2 then mash R2 for even more cool shit
[2:59:38] <$Sphincter_Spelunker> toot
[2:59:44] <+CalderGaming> DOOT
[2:59:45] <$hewlettfan96> Brap
[2:59:48] <Psyramics> you can jump on the wheel to get at the archer
[2:59:49] <%rumtumtugnutz> Bloodhound sword? Did you get it from Jimmy Pop Ali?
[2:59:54] <+TopTieramisu> straight up artorias swing
[2:59:55] <$hewlettfan96> Most people are not nice
[2:59:55] <%SuckerPunchSyd> Thats so cool!
[2:59:55] <cartakus> Storm castle is so big
[3:00:06] <+CalderGaming> THE SWORD'S GOOD
[3:00:07] <RickyRelucent> yeah see, thats where you went wrong
[3:00:07] <+TopTieramisu> or i guess more sif
[3:00:12] <heartlesshealer> okay yeah this is a sword for you
[3:00:13] <leinadtonu> Hard hit after that slash is a work of beauty
[3:00:15] <RickyRelucent> French people are stereotypically foul
[3:00:23] <%rumtumtugnutz> He ytooted his doot doot floot
[3:00:24] <$hewlettfan96> They just want to find excuses to fight and kill each other
[3:00:25] <%Nordguy> @hewlettfan96 its the same in norway if you're old-passing. ypu wouldn't believe the horrible shit i jear as a silverhaired 20 yo in taxis
[3:00:26] <RickyRelucent> in a variety of manners
[3:00:27] <SecondBerial> @peachsaliva follow it up with a heavy
[3:00:33] <SecondBerial> it's tits
[3:00:34] <RickyRelucent> which may or may not apply
[3:00:40] <SecondBerial> its
[3:00:42] <cartakus> I canta believe that weapon is so early, and it has bleed also
[3:00:42] <$Sphincter_Spelunker> yes... ha ha ha... yes! Curved Greatswords for life
[3:00:42] <+TopTieramisu> some of these weapon arts do obscene damage
[3:00:46] <RickyRelucent> and its woman are very forward
[3:00:55] <%Jackgar> Bleeding weapons MELT big enemies like bosses and giants, too. Once the bleed buildup hits the threshold they lose a TON of health all at once
[3:00:55] <SecondBerial> Yeyeyeyeye
[3:00:58] <+CalderGaming> time to start allocating blue flasks
[3:00:58] <%CptCreampuff16> that invis makes you invincible i think
[3:00:59] <$hewlettfan96> Yes very
[3:01:05] <+Walopoh> those nationalists lose their shit at anybody pointing out anything wrong in their "perfect" nation and then call themselves "realists". The equivalent of holding their ears shut and screeching
[3:01:08] <SecondBerial> fun pvp tech
[3:01:09] <$zyberion626> just drink your blue raspberry lemonade @PeachSaliva
[3:01:15] <%Jackgar> Also you haven't even upgraded it yet, so once you get a couple levels on it, the weapon gets even more fun
[3:01:33] <$hewlettfan96> Why do you hate lemonade so much Paige?? I don‚Äôt get it?
[3:01:37] <RickyRelucent> because thats acknowledging the problem
[3:01:38] <SecondBerial> lot to like, plenty to hate as well!
[3:01:38] <+Walopoh> Nobody does, it's literally human nature to draw more attention to shitty things to fix them
[3:01:39] <RickyRelucent> and when they do
[3:01:43] <RickyRelucent> theyget called a racist
[3:01:46] <RickyRelucent> shrug
[3:01:55] <jetpack_rorschasch> Don‚Äôt be sorry, you‚Äôre just sharing your personal experiences.
[3:02:14] <%CptCreampuff16> btw dont mean to force you to use a weapon you dont like just think its a cool sword everyone should test out
[3:02:20] <%Jackgar> Look at how much it gains per level
[3:02:21] <$hewlettfan96> Yeah I hear Canada is just a nicer place to live in general compared to the states, not my opinion just from word of mouth
[3:02:26] <%Jackgar> +20 damage per level
[3:02:33] <SecondBerial> always test the moveset
[3:02:38] <$hewlettfan96> What is taht thing
[3:02:39] <heartlesshealer> monetarily it's usually better
[3:02:44] <SecondBerial> you never know what you'll like
[3:02:44] <RickyRelucent> when they would point one some of the nations flaws or w/e
[3:02:48] <RickyRelucent> or themselves
[3:02:51] <%FingaLights> How high a level do special weapons get?
[3:02:52] <+Walopoh> It REALLY depends
[3:03:00] <$zyberion626> there is no place 100% perfect
[3:03:02] <%Sotetsu> MySpace Status: It's complicated
[3:03:03] <%Jackgar> @FingaLights 10 I htink?
[3:03:12] <@CreepyPorpoise> The grass is always greener on the other side
[3:03:13] <+Walopoh> oh yeah Canada's racism is a well-known "secret"
[3:03:13] <SecondBerial> as a US citizen I wanna move to Canada so bad
[3:03:16] <$hewlettfan96> @zyberion626 Denmark comes close
[3:03:17] <%Jackgar> From what I've seen regular weapons go to like....+25 or something crazy
[3:03:25] <heartlesshealer> no emptying your entire extended family's savings from getting cancer, but yeah both countries have huge problems with treating the indigenous properly
[3:03:28] <jetpack_rorschasch> Meh, apples and oranges really.
[3:03:34] <RickyRelucent> canada's racist? the explains the apologies
[3:03:44] <+akita_opal> I think it's a place that has similar shitty things the states have.  but, it's a vanilla bean vs. vanilla in terms of difference.
[3:03:49] <$zyberion626> @hewlettfan96 yeah for the Danish
[3:03:51] <SecondBerial> no country treats its indigenous ppl well. it really sucks
[3:03:52] <@CreepyPorpoise> Woooooow
[3:03:56] <$hewlettfan96> Yeah it‚Äôs a very broad statement, there is no ‚Äòperfect‚Äô country where there‚Äôs no war and chocolate fountains and candy rainbows
[3:04:00] <%Sotetsu> How dare you.
[3:04:10] <%AncelDeLambert> aight, work done, time to drive home. see ya in 15, guys
[3:04:12] <%FacetiousAF> @hewlettfan96 and a living wage and good maternity leave
[3:04:18] <%Jackgar> This weapon is really good on the horse
[3:04:18] <heartlesshealer> have a safe drive
[3:04:19] <+CalderGaming> it's true, West coast US loves passive aggression
[3:04:21] <$hewlettfan96> Is it cold where you live?
[3:04:26] <$Chatterbox1991> You mean the thing where Pat yells at you to ask before stealing his food?
[3:04:26] <%Nordguy> @hewlettfan96 Denmark is very ignorant abt anything non wur√∏pea
[3:04:28] <%Jackgar> Yeah I was going to say, as a Bostonian, we very much DO NOT have that problem!
[3:04:31] <RickyRelucent> thing is we can both demonize radical liberalism or dictatorship
[3:04:32] <+CalderGaming> [native Californian here]
[3:04:35] <%Nordguy> European*
[3:04:38] <%Sotetsu> East Coast best coast, wooooo! ironmouseWiggly
[3:04:38] <heartlesshealer> or just ANY maternity leave is an upgrade
[3:04:39] <RickyRelucent> we just need to find a good midway point
[3:04:44] <RickyRelucent> and putin needs to fuck off
[3:04:49] <RickyRelucent> literally trump tier
[3:04:50] <@CreepyPorpoise> creepy49Hmm
[3:04:51] <RickyRelucent> rn
[3:04:58] <jetpack_rorschasch> ‚ÄúHOW DARE YOU!‚Äù *cluches pearls*
[3:05:08] <+CalderGaming> what's up porp
[3:05:18] <SecondBerial> East coast US is weird so many specific fast food chains
[3:05:19] <@CreepyPorpoise> the sad thing is, Canada's Maternity leave isn't even that amazing, its just way better than the zero the US requires.
[3:05:19] <%Nordguy> @hewlettfan96 otherwise its very lovely
[3:05:22] <+TopTieramisu> definitely would say he's worse than trump because he knows how to stay in power
[3:05:23] <%Jackgar> But you can't have healthcare because that's SOCIALISM! And that's the scary word!
[3:05:34] <$hewlettfan96> @nordguy Yes but it‚Äôs also probably the most peaceful country to live in, it‚Äôs frequently ranked at the top of GDP and live satisfaction indexes, it‚Äôs generally considered one of teh nicest places to live
[3:05:43] <%Sotetsu> That sword looks so fun
[3:05:50] <+CalderGaming> tree hulk tree hulk tree hulk
[3:05:53] <cartakus> land of the free is like gotta catch them all from pokemon

[3:12:23] <%Jackgar> Try near the cliffs
[3:12:25] <MrMoonGoose> Heh, found one of these earlier. It isn't the tree, but it isn't super important.
[3:12:29] <$hewlettfan96> A singing tree
[3:12:29] <jetpack_rorschasch> I heard yodelling!
[3:12:30] <SecondBerial> there is a source

[3:13:08] <+TopTieramisu> wrong cliffside
[3:13:14] <%Sotetsu> Use your ear balls.
[3:13:16] <%FingaLights> Who's Talking??
[3:13:21] <Danitaras> who's talking
[3:13:25] <+TopTieramisu> warmer
[3:13:32] <%Jackgar> The singing will get louder as you get closer
[3:13:35] <hereiam407> not ominous at all
[3:13:58] <%Nordguy> ngl I've sat down and listened to this for real its so pretty
[3:14:06] <peachy996> Pretty voice
[3:14:08] <%FacetiousAF> ave maria and all that
[3:14:08] <hereiam407> It's like Kass's accordion in the distance
[3:14:08] <jetpack_rorschasch> Maybe it‚Äôs sunsetting in Elden Ring Kappa
[3:14:14] <MrMoonGoose> Disappointment ahead
[3:14:18] <heartlesshealer> no one say anything, she'll find that singer
[3:14:34] <%Jackgar> DHave you tried using your L1 while on the horse?
[3:14:51] <%Nordguy> yall got any chant playlists to recommend??
[3:14:55] <RickyRelucent> y'know someguy has a 10 hour loop of this guy singing on YT already
[3:14:56] <%Jackgar> Found him
[3:14:59] <+TopTieramisu> yep
[3:15:00] <hereiam407> Singing Furry?
[3:15:03] <hereiam407> Furie*

[3:15:07] <%Sotetsu> Got 'er
[3:15:08] <Kain5707> that VA has a pretty voice
[3:15:17] <heartlesshealer> you were looking at a manbat singing
[3:15:26] <%FingaLights> I've said that so many times playing this game "wtf even is that?!"
[3:15:28] <jetpack_rorschasch> Like any good hobo, she‚Äôs under a bridge.
[3:15:31] <+CalderGaming> Britney spears bat cause it's toxic
[3:15:33] <%Jackgar> RIP Singing Bat Dude
[3:15:36] <+Teilwal> and a mouth
[3:15:39] <SecondBerial> the harpy sings to lure ppl. it got me too lol
[3:15:45] <Joco2222> rip
[3:15:50] <+TopTieramisu> i was freaked out when i found out
[3:15:52] <heartlesshealer> they are my favorite thing aside from the little worm dudes
[3:16:20] <MrMoonGoose> Teilwal like 'what that mouth do'
[3:16:22] <+CalderGaming> I mean, you're not far off
[3:16:23] <+Teilwal> bleh bleh bleh
[3:16:25] <%Nordguy> I can't believe you killef that opera singer what a monster
[3:16:30] <hereiam407> Furies look a lot friendlier than Harpies
[3:16:32] <%Jackgar> The rare Man-Harpie
[3:16:35] <+TopTieramisu> the closest thing to vampires is in bloodborne
[3:16:35] <%FacetiousAF> poisoned by young frankenstein
[3:16:40] <%Jackgar> You don't often have that trope with a male voice
[3:16:42] <%FingaLights> Marpie?
[3:16:51] <hereiam407> HarMan
[3:16:55] <%SveriSageAdvice> tiny ones only
[3:16:57] <%Jackgar> Just the tiny ones
[3:17:02] <+Teilwal> Dan HarMan?
[3:17:05] <+CalderGaming> seeds are from glowy trees AND SOME OTHER THINGS but not minor erdtrees
[3:17:06] <%CptCreampuff16> you got materials for custom potions
[3:17:12] <hereiam407> He has a beautiful voice
[3:17:13] <+TopTieramisu> from what i can tell, erdtrees are just for fighting those avatars
[3:17:19] <heartlesshealer> I think male harpies are called Alan(s?) or something
[3:17:25] <%Jackgar> Your reward for that boss was giving you more options for your Wonderous Physick mixtures
[3:17:25] <jetpack_rorschasch> QUEEN OF THE HARPES! HERE‚ÄôS YOUR CROWN YOUR MAJESTY!
[3:17:30] <heartlesshealer> unless Elden Ring has its own name for them
[3:17:59] <+TopTieramisu> touching the guys
[3:18:00] <%Sotetsu> Poison cute items would probably be helpful
[3:18:05] <+CalderGaming> so they're not for crafting, they're like ashes of war for a separate 1-charge flask
[3:18:17] <%Sotetsu> Those things point you to dungeons
[3:18:19] <+Teilwal> guide you to secrets
[3:18:20] <%Jellly_> they point towards dungeons
[3:18:21] <%FingaLights> Show you dank shit
[3:18:22] <%CptCreampuff16> follow the light
[3:18:24] <+demon1103> follow the glowing strand and find out
[3:18:25] <jetpack_rorschasch> Touch him, touch him good!
[3:18:25] <%Jackgar> It's giving you a clue for a secret
[3:18:26] <+badhaye> point to dungeons
[3:18:37] <Psyramics> follow it
[3:18:45] <+Teilwal> points to don johns
[3:18:56] <heartlesshealer> I'm mixing myths, ignore everything I said. Alans are their own winged creature thing
[3:19:02] <+CalderGaming> what about don Quixotes Kappa
[3:19:08] <hereiam407> But....
[3:19:17] <%Jackgar> Hey for funsies, have you gone down to the area with all the bloodstains in the round table zone?
[3:19:29] <+TopTieramisu> i'm guessing paige hasn't gotten her free hugs
[3:19:38] <acepangolin1> what level is she?
[3:19:42] <%FingaLights> How she has, many
[3:19:52] <%Jackgar> I STILL haven't found this Lanya girl
[3:19:54] <$Sphincter_Spelunker> Paige's mom made her anxious and that's the end of the story
[3:20:03] <+TopTieramisu> a stray pat in the bg
[3:20:08] <+cvp5127> cant believe those hugs debuff you
[3:20:22] <%Jackgar> Might as well
[3:20:26] <%SveriSageAdvice> should be fine
[3:20:40] <%Jackgar> HERESY
[3:20:50] <%FingaLights> He say's this every time, I swear
[3:20:56] <+CalderGaming> this poor guy, all you do is bring him what he considers to be evil bullshit
[3:20:59] <+TopTieramisu> @cvp5127 i heard they give you more poise?
[3:21:05] <%Sotetsu> Hershey!
[3:21:06] <%Jackgar> edge, lord
[3:21:06] <$Sphincter_Spelunker> just a little heresy, as a treat
[3:21:07] <cartakus> Kinda new that a cleric does not care about hex stuff
[3:21:07] <+TopTieramisu> so it's not all negative
[3:21:18] <cartakus> Okay dad!
[3:21:39] <+Fetrigon> wait wtf is that the map????
[3:21:48] <+cvp5127> @TopTieramisu the item she gives you cures the debuff and gives you more poise
[3:21:51] <cartakus> not even 50%
[3:21:51] <+TopTieramisu> yeah. the map expands as you discover new areas
[3:22:26] <+Fetrigon> holy fuck this game is huge.
[3:22:29] <%FingaLights> Game big
[3:22:31] <+TopTieramisu> look at those curiously shaped clouds
[3:22:32] <%Jackgar> The game super lies to you about the size of the map when you start the game
[3:22:50] <%Jackgar> Which is awesome
[3:22:54] <+TopTieramisu> the map isn't lying, you just haven't found more pieces :)
[3:23:04] <jetpack_rorschasch> Learnia! The most educated of all the Elden lands!
[3:23:10] <%Bloomingzonda> The area of the map paige has not uncovered is bigger than what she has
[3:23:11] <%FingaLights> It's a good lie. Makes you feel less terrified about where to go
[3:23:13] <cartakus> God I hope there, most of the crazy weapons are in the dlcs in the series. like bone fist
[3:23:18] <%Jackgar> Oh you found the elevator, I see
[3:23:20] <+TopTieramisu> that area is so cool
[3:23:23] <%Jackgar> That zone is AMAZING
[3:23:32] <%Jackgar> Nah this is just a tree
[3:23:34] <+TopTieramisu> it's probably one of the coolest areas fromsoft has ever made visually
[3:23:34] <%Jackgar> Okay so
[3:23:35] <%Jackgar> L1
[3:23:37] <cartakus> Fuck that river
[3:23:39] <+TopTieramisu> that area and caelid
[3:23:41] <%Jackgar> L1 on the horse swings on your left
[3:23:46] <jetpack_rorschasch> Spooooky
[3:24:01] <%Bloomingzonda> @cartakus The base game already has the craziest weapon I have seen in ant from soft game
[3:24:11] <+TopTieramisu> Jebasted
[3:24:17] <cartakus> Yeah it's great
[3:24:21] <%Jackgar> That's a good troll
[3:24:28] <+TopTieramisu> a harmless troll
[3:24:43] <%Jackgar> @Bloomingzonda Crazier than the pizza cutter?
[3:24:46] <%Bloomingzonda> Paige went in the troll hole haha
[3:24:48] <+TopTieramisu> bust a butt
[3:24:53] <cartakus> I just hope there is a dragon form stone. Just not like ds3 one....
[3:24:58] <%FingaLights> \o/ Praise be the Golden poo
[3:25:06] <%CptCreampuff16> finish castle?
[3:25:15] <+TopTieramisu> caelid is sooooo cool
[3:25:15] <%Jackgar> @cartakus There are spells that summon dragon body parts
[3:25:20] <+TopTieramisu> literal nightmare land
[3:25:25] <%Jackgar> I would suggest maybe going to fight the boss
[3:25:27] <%Bloomingzonda> @Jackgar look up Cipher Pata
[3:25:28] <jetpack_rorschasch> Oh boy!
[3:25:29] <cartakus> Yup I'm using those
[3:25:30] <%CptCreampuff16> the trex dogs are terrifying
[3:25:31] <%Jackgar> Just because it opens up stuff
[3:25:40] <+TopTieramisu> the crows are also horrifying
[3:25:43] <%ItalianWaifu> ItalianWaifu subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 12 months! 
[3:25:49] <%FingaLights> Paige is gonna just bust Godrick right open when she gets to him
[3:26:02] <hereiam407> good name
[3:26:10] <%Jackgar> @Bloomingzonda Ooooh, that thing. I have it but I ahven't used it yet. Although I can because I'm doing a lot of faith
[3:26:31] <%Jackgar> The fact that it's unblockable sounds nuts
[3:26:32] <+TopTieramisu> LUL
[3:26:37] <hereiam407> LUL
[3:26:40] <cartakus> lol
[3:26:48] <hereiam407> Quite a crowd
[3:27:06] <cartakus> amazing
[3:27:07] <%Bloomingzonda> @Jackgar Yeah fighting with unblockable words sounds nuts
[3:27:10] <%hereiam407> hereiam407 subscribed at Tier 1. 
[3:28:03] <+TopTieramisu> i think i messed up my build trying to go spellsword
[3:28:11] <%Jackgar> Although to get it you have to fight a pretty tough dude
[3:28:27] <+TopTieramisu> LUL
[3:28:28] <%Jackgar> But you could get it basically whenever you want
[3:28:33] <%Jackgar> PFFFFFFT that damage
[3:28:42] <%FingaLights> Yeah, I feel like I've been spreading myself too thin on stats
[3:28:50] <cartakus> That guy is a pain in the ass
[3:28:58] <%AncelDeLambert> oh damn it the THICC tree
[3:29:02] <+CalderGaming> f
[3:29:04] <+Walopoh> Holy SHit LUL
[3:29:08] <%AncelDeLambert> these bitches is ROUGH
[3:29:09] <MrMoonGoose> eff
[3:29:09] <Gruhunchously> crunch
[3:29:11] <cartakus> And there goes the bullut hell
[3:29:11] <+TopTieramisu> @FingaLights seriously. i've been putting stats into mind, int, strength, dex
[3:29:14] <+TopTieramisu> too many areas
[3:29:24] <MrMoonGoose> @PeachSaliva You can totally beat it
[3:29:31] <+TopTieramisu> i have like half of paige's health
[3:29:33] <%AncelDeLambert> oh, THIS one. I've avoided this one
[3:29:40] <+TopTieramisu> and we're similar levels
[3:29:41] <+RedMaskBandit> This one was tough but theres a grace in a cave to the NE of the tree
[3:29:53] <Pokakaa> Wow peach you're on fire with streaming.
[3:29:58] <%Jackgar> SURPRISE DUNGEON
[3:29:59] <%AncelDeLambert> oooooooo
[3:30:03] <%AncelDeLambert> I need to go here
[3:30:17] <%AncelDeLambert> dis fox on fiya
[3:30:19] <Pokakaa> ninilo2Niniluv
[3:30:26] <cartakus> It feels like a quality build with some form of magick is not great on level points to spend
[3:30:33] <MrMoonGoose> @PeachSaliva A little fire might help with the wooden-looking brute outside
[3:30:40] <+TopTieramisu> i really wanted to be a spellsword in this game
[3:30:43] <%Bloomingzonda> @TopTieramisu I'm working on spell sword and my idea is to do a Dex build and do enough mind and int to use some range spells like the fireballs that aren't huge
[3:30:58] <%FacetiousAF> those are technical difficulties for another day
[3:31:01] <Pokakaa> I love dark souls and elden ring, but I always end up just playing Guts...
[3:31:03] <+TopTieramisu> @Bloomingzonda currently my biggest damage dealer is sword arts
[3:31:12] <Pokakaa> *Googles where the greatsword is at*
[3:31:29] <%wizard_of_diamonds> Thank you Paige, your Big and Strong aura gave me the courage to face a powerful dragon and win 1st try! Woot
[3:31:30] <%FingaLights> Yeah, feel like you gotta pick either faith or int, then either strength or dex
[3:31:34] <%maskofmichael> maskofmichael subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 29 months! 29 months. That's like 145 dollars, or around 50 bottles of mustard. Please don't drown in the mustard Paige.
[3:31:37] <%Jackgar> There's an incantation called Flames of Frenzy you may have picked up from the peninsula that is SUPER cool
[3:32:04] <+TopTieramisu> blood blade does like 4 times my regular strikes
[3:32:06] <Pokakaa> When you think about it, being Guts is the most practical build choice and probably the encouraged/preferred of the games creator.
[3:32:09] <+TopTieramisu> or more
[3:32:17] <%Bloomingzonda> Its funny that we can hear Pat's ringgasming in the background
[3:32:27] <%FingaLights> why pat yelling?
[3:32:41] <%maskofmichael> @FingaLights Cause he's Pat
[3:32:42] <cartakus> Greatsword plus beast side step makes you feel like guts, only need armour
[3:32:51] <%FingaLights> @FingaLights fair enough
[3:32:55] <%Bloomingzonda> @TopTieramisu I saw that people are using the blood blade with the twin blade to be darth maul
[3:32:56] <%Jackgar> The block+L2 counter works wonders on these little bastards
[3:33:02] <+TopTieramisu> i was gonna dedicate my second build to go full guts
[3:33:06] <Pokakaa> @cartakus Dark Souls 3 had the closest
[3:33:09] <my2k_> helloooo thank you for streaming
[3:33:11] <%Jackgar> Errr, R2 counter
[3:33:19] <+TopTieramisu> @TopTieramisu ok, that sounds awesome
[3:33:35] <%AncelDeLambert> gotta use that R2 charge
[3:33:37] <jetpack_rorschasch> He yells at everything
[3:33:39] <Pokakaa> I think there's a set called the beast champion, but I don't know if it's worth it.
[3:33:50] <miniyuna> 8 raiders from miniyuna have joined! 
[3:33:52] <+TopTieramisu> if pat isn't yelling, he's thinking of a reason to yell
[3:33:57] <miniyuna> <3 miniyu2Temsmile lobennPikapop
[3:33:59] <%Jackgar> Yeah the R2 swing on this weapon is VERY good, as is its Guard Counter
[3:34:02] <miniyuna> <3 <3
[3:34:04] <%Jackgar> It's a huge sweep
[3:34:09] <miniyuna> hows the elden ring??
[3:34:09] <+RedMaskBandit> PokBlaziken
[3:34:16] <%tentavision> he does! psaBlind psaGoblin
[3:34:22] <cartakus> onestly I would be fine with the nazgul rider armour but that thing is still hiden
[3:34:41] <%hereiam407> Good
[3:34:50] <%Bloomingzonda> Paige is so lucky she caught herself a screamer LUL
[3:34:54] <+TopTieramisu> fromsoft struck a nice balance between the challenge you expect while also making it more accessible
[3:35:02] <+TopTieramisu> with a lot more organic ways to make the game easier
[3:35:08] <Pokakaa> If you cheat and set all of your stats to 99 but don't change anything else, it becomes Eldenrim
[3:35:28] <%tentavision> i had never even played a souls game before but when i played Bloodborne I STILL couldn't call them anything but souls
[3:35:33] <+TopTieramisu> scarlet rot, baby
[3:35:38] <%Jackgar> Uh oh
[3:35:39] <+TopTieramisu> aka toxic
[3:35:51] <Pokakaa> Oh is that what Scarlet does.
[3:35:53] <%Jackgar> You did open the boss door though
[3:35:59] <%Bloomingzonda> Oh no she got the blood poop on her
[3:36:04] <%tentavision> fromsoft loves elevators in fantasy almost as much as griffin McElroy
[3:36:14] <%Jackgar> You opened the boss door for that dungeon
[3:36:16] <+CalderGaming> yeah scarlet rot is just dark souls toxic, but with new lore
[3:36:17] <Pokakaa> Ever since I learned Torrent is immune to those effects in the swamp, my feet never touched the ground once...
[3:36:25] <+TopTieramisu> @tentavision this game has the king of all fromsoft elevators
[3:36:38] <%Jackgar> Unfortunately you can't use Torrent in dungeons
[3:36:42] <%Jackgar> That would be too good
[3:36:46] <Pokakaa> NEIGH! :D
[3:37:04] <+TopTieramisu> hooves are like feet armor
[3:37:11] <Pokakaa> You mean finger armor.
[3:37:22] <%FingaLights> This castle is very confusing
[3:37:24] <Pokakaa> They run.
[3:37:26] <Pokakaa> On.
[3:37:29] <Pokakaa> Fingers.
[3:37:30] <+CalderGaming> cursed animal fact reminder: hooves are modified finger/toenails
[3:37:41] <%CptCreampuff16> to the left of painting
[3:37:48] <+TopTieramisu> yeah, but it's covering the foot, not a finger
[3:38:01] <Pokakaa> That's where you're half right.
[3:38:08] <+CalderGaming> the toe. that's the correct analogous bone
[3:38:15] <Pokakaa> It's BOTH! :D
[3:38:28] <+RedMaskBandit> Does T have shoes?
[3:38:35] <%tentavision> it's not a foot. its a toe which is only part of a foot
[3:38:38] <%FingaLights> Hooven feet are actually them ballerina dancing on their toes
[3:38:40] <%FacetiousAF> does... doesn't the light give you away?
[3:38:45] <+TopTieramisu> isn't it more like the ball of the foot + toes?
[3:38:46] <Pokakaa> I don't imagine Torrent needs shoes
[3:39:04] <+CalderGaming> @facetiousaf one of the few bones that fromsoft throws us
[3:39:06] <Psyramics> that dude had a bag on his head
[3:39:09] <Pokakaa> He doesn't even conform to the laws that govern our reality.
[3:39:14] <%Jackgar> As far as I'm aware the light doesn't matter for enemy sight
[3:39:18] <Pokakaa> Or that reality either.
[3:39:19] <%Jackgar> Oh man, this room
[3:39:20] <Sunstalker> Stealth is not *that* advanced
[3:39:28] <Pokakaa> It's skyrim stealth.
[3:39:39] <Pokakaa> As long as they aren't looking directly at you, it works.
[3:39:39] <Danitaras> dooooot
[3:39:40] <+TopTieramisu> they call it tippy toeing, but you're actually balancing on the balls of your feet
[3:39:43] <%Ranryu692> you can summon in the courtyard
[3:39:45] <%FacetiousAF> what that pat screaming Kappa
[3:39:48] <%tentavision> they employed a Screaming Monkey security system
[3:39:51] <jetpack_rorschasch> Finger but hole
[3:39:57] <CoffeeKaiju> pastarat
[3:40:03] <%Jackgar> R2 clears out the whole pack in one go with this weapon
[3:40:07] <%tentavision> finger but hoof
[3:40:10] <$hewlettfan96> Patrat
[3:40:16] <MrMoonGoose> I too pray to LORDE in times of trouble.
[3:40:19] <%Jackgar> These are almost never bosses. Almost never.
[3:40:30] <+CalderGaming> that guard could sense you not speaking Land Between-ish and started jumping up and down and screaming to alert the whole castle
[3:40:32] <Pokakaa> I don't imagine Lorde hears those requests.
[3:40:35] <%CptCreampuff16> where are you trying to go?
[3:40:39] <Pokakaa> Though I bet she appreciates them.
[3:40:43] <%Jackgar> I'm glad they made chests invincible now
[3:40:50] <%Jackgar> Accidentally smashing a chest is the worst
[3:40:54] <%Bloomingzonda> they are magic
[3:40:58] <%Ranryu692> they have high requirements
[3:41:17] <Pokakaa> God I feel old. I just remembered the time Pat threatened to ban me from the TBF facebook page.
[3:41:24] <+CalderGaming> I accidentally learned that you have a short window to run/dodge out of the way of trap chest teleportation clouds
[3:41:30] <%Bloomingzonda> The book lets you use anime black fire
[3:41:32] <%FingaLights> Yeah, that was a dumb in DS2 @Jackgar
[3:41:48] <Pokakaa> Wow... that was 10 years ago.
[3:42:01] <%tentavision> dragon of the darkness flaaaaame
[3:42:10] <Pokakaa> And there's still more dark souls.
[3:42:10] <+RedMaskBandit> I noticed that only matters to a very select few enemies like the trumpet fucks in Storm castle
[3:42:17] <Pokakaa> What a time to be alive.
[3:42:17] <%Jackgar> Ambush them!
[3:42:38] <%Bloomingzonda> Oh no paige has full balls
[3:42:41] <%Jackgar> What's nice is that there are way more places to safely sit if you need to now
[3:42:42] <jetpack_rorschasch> Hmmm
[3:42:46] <Pokakaa> Gotta release the balls.
[3:42:46] <+TopTieramisu> ds2 really ran away with trying to make the player feel miserable
[3:42:56] <Pokakaa> That way she can convert more fluids from the mustards.
[3:43:08] <+TopTieramisu> "run too much? now you can't run until your stam is back to full" "opening doors? no invincibility, fucker"
[3:43:11] <%Jackgar> Like real talk, I'll say this since she's afk so as not to spoil, but I haven't found a single mimic yet
[3:43:12] <%Bloomingzonda> I have never actually beat DS2 becuase its more annoying than fun to me
[3:43:15] <%Jackgar> Trapped chests, however...
[3:43:17] <+RedMaskBandit> Like i feel that enemies should hear you if youre wearing med equipment load
[3:43:36] <%Jackgar> This game feels WAAAAY more fair than DS2
[3:43:55] <+TopTieramisu> it's funny when you're sneaking around and make a loud crash by bumping into debris but no one reacts
[3:43:58] <%Jackgar> DS2 is like they felt like they had to "live up" to thee reputation of difficulty from DeS and DS1
[3:43:59] <%FingaLights> Same, I stopped DS2. Mixed of bored and annoyed
[3:44:20] <%FacetiousAF> big stretches everyone
[3:44:23] <%Bloomingzonda> The bosses are also so boring in DS2
[3:44:34] <+TopTieramisu> "drink estus? it's no longer instant heal, bitch"
[3:44:37] <Pokakaa> That's just because they are humanoid more in that game
[3:44:41] <+CalderGaming> no mimics for me so far but more than one npc disguised as a plant
[3:44:53] <%Jackgar> @CalderGaming Oh yeah, that poor guy
[3:44:55] <ergulor> Wah
[3:45:00] <%hereiam407> wahhh
[3:45:00] <%FacetiousAF> mac confirm
[3:45:01] <%FacetiousAF> mic
[3:45:02] <%Jackgar> Wah
[3:45:06] <%FacetiousAF> paige voice yes
[3:45:07] <+TopTieramisu> "want iframes? better dump stats into it"
[3:45:09] <%SveriSageAdvice> yeye big wah
[3:45:10] <+imthewisejanitor> Waaaah
[3:45:13] <+RedMaskBandit> I remember trying to sneak and I fell ontop of some crates and some enemies seen't me
[3:45:13] <%hereiam407> mmm
[3:45:20] <Pokakaa> DS1 had a good mix of humanoid and non-humanoid bosses. DS2 had more human. DS3 had more non-human. That's how we got the Bludburns
[3:45:20] <%FacetiousAF> fun fact: pee is stored in your balls
[3:45:23] <%Nordguy> hot
[3:45:27] <%FingaLights> She had to switch balls
[3:45:27] <jetpack_rorschasch> Yep
[3:45:34] <%Jackgar> Nah
[3:45:36] <%Jackgar> Other side
[3:45:41] <%Jackgar> Leftt side
[3:45:43] <+imthewisejanitor> Elden Balls
[3:45:48] <%Jackgar> Ye
[3:45:53] <%FingaLights> Balls full? Take them out and switch them for empty ones!
[3:45:56] <+RedMaskBandit> Check surroundings
[3:45:57] <%hereiam407> Mama said gators are ornery cus they got all that pee and no penis
[3:45:59] <Sunstalker> Get the top one first
[3:46:02] <%Jackgar> You can do it!
[3:46:08] <%Jackgar> This side lets you get the top guy first
[3:46:09] <%Bloomingzonda> Women also keep their eggs in their balls so if they hold in their pee they will have pickle babies
[3:46:11] <Pokakaa> Gotta dump the old balls out later.
[3:46:12] <Sunstalker> Because if you jumpt to his spot first, you can't get back up to it$
[3:46:15] <+TopTieramisu> has paige fought the boss in stormveil? i remember pat mentioning she skipped past this whole area
[3:46:26] <%CptCreampuff16> one at a time
[3:46:27] <%Ranryu692> I don't even recognize this part of the castle LUL
[3:46:39] <%Jackgar> They are big deaf
[3:46:42] <%Ranryu692> very sneaky
[3:46:58] <Danitaras> stealth
[3:47:04] <Pokakaa> I just realized that despite playing much more than Peach, I am way behind her because I haven't followed anything REMOTELY RESEMBLING a linear path.
[3:47:04] <%Jackgar> I hate that you can't use the siege weapons after killing their user
[3:47:16] <%Bloomingzonda> I think the crouch makes it so thing only notice you if the is a striaght line from their eyes to you
[3:47:27] <+TopTieramisu> @Jackgar agreed
[3:47:33] <+RedMaskBandit> That part is only accessible if u use a stonekey past some rats
[3:47:33] <ken_kuma> That sword's neat
[3:47:35] <%Jackgar> They're VERY focused on manning those ballistae
[3:47:36] <%FingaLights> They are VERY focused
[3:47:56] <Pokakaa> No, those metal greaves are just really quiet
[3:48:03] <+imthewisejanitor> Bee attack!
[3:48:18] <%FingaLights> Hood looks cooler
[3:48:20] <%Ranryu692> Paige you're very strong, you'll be fine
[3:48:27] <+TopTieramisu> i feel like i explored a fair bit of this game and i have a sadly tiny wardrobe still
[3:48:37] <%Jackgar> Yeah the armor you have now is about the best stuff you're likely to have for this area
[3:48:48] <Pokakaa> I like their armor because it's good high level rogue armor.
[3:48:56] <+TopTieramisu> exile armor is my favorite of this area
[3:49:01] <+TopTieramisu> because it looks cool
[3:49:09] <+TopTieramisu> i'm still using it actually
[3:49:11] <%Jackgar> I love the while rising R1 on this weapon from the crouch
[3:49:11] <Pokakaa> No it's not, there's better armor from the godrick knights technically.
[3:49:15] <%Jackgar> This is A way to go
[3:49:16] <Pokakaa> If you like heavy armor that is.
[3:49:25] <%FingaLights> Depends on what you are trying to do
[3:49:25] <%Jackgar> There are a bunch of possible approaches
[3:49:29] <%CptCreampuff16> yes
[3:49:35] <Pokakaa> yes
[3:49:36] <%FingaLights> There are many
[3:49:38] <+TopTieramisu> one of several paths
[3:49:38] <%Ranryu692> You can also summon wolves or w/e
[3:49:44] <%CptCreampuff16> theres one other way but it involves jumping on roofs
[3:49:48] <%Jackgar> Oh there's a whole alternate roof-hopping route you could have taken up where the group of guys where one has the horn
[3:49:56] <Pokakaa> Don't think you have to go to godrick too soon, you can always just go around.
[3:49:59] <%Jackgar> That place where you first found out how cool this weapon's L2 was
[3:50:07] <%Jackgar> You could start roof-hopping up there
[3:50:13] <%Ranryu692> If you summon something you should be fine, you're way stronger than I was when I came through here, and you're way better at these games than I am
[3:50:36] <%Ranryu692> no it is, I've never beaten one of these games lol
[3:50:39] <%wizard_of_diamonds> I just had the most WTF experience in ER, but I have no idea what triggered it and I don't want to describe it unless it's spoilers
[3:50:39] <ken_kuma> Yeah, for real. You'll do better than I did with em
[3:50:46] <+TopTieramisu> you're definitely more than equipped to handle this area's boss
[3:50:47] <%Ranryu692> they don't engage until you do
[3:50:49] <%Jackgar> "Nah we're good"
[3:50:51] <%FingaLights> nice
[3:50:51] <Shockmaster182> The sword is sick as fuck
[3:50:54] <+imthewisejanitor> LUL
[3:50:56] <%FingaLights> Good boies
[3:50:57] <%Ranryu692> so you can sneak still
[3:50:57] <Pokakaa> Peach's years of dark souls experience has hardened her into an amazing mediumcore gamer
[3:50:58] <%AncelDeLambert> you have to create hostility first
[3:51:00] <%Jackgar> "Lone Wolves" - there are 3 of them
[3:51:00] <+polothegreatest> LUL
[3:51:03] <$zyberion626> "we want to discuss our healthcare package"
[3:51:04] <%wizard_of_diamonds> @PeachSaliva You have to engage the mob or a mob has to aggro on you
[3:51:06] <+TopTieramisu> i don't think they aggro for you
[3:51:06] <%AncelDeLambert> THEY WANT YOU TO BACKSTAB
[3:51:08] <Shockmaster182> You have to name them first
[3:51:13] <suddenlyscorched> Oh no she summoned Gief instead
[3:51:18] <TalisKanju> Pat and Paige streaming at the same time?
[3:51:21] <jetpack_rorschasch> Boys‚Ä¶ come on
[3:51:22] <%Jackgar> They know you're trying to use them as bait and they're like "Nah fuck you, lady"
[3:51:24] <+RedMaskBandit> Lol theyre on their union break till u attack
[3:51:32] <%AncelDeLambert> god, Paige is gonna be so cool once she gets one of these wind ashes
[3:51:34] <+imthewisejanitor> Bois pls
[3:51:36] <+TopTieramisu> uh oh
[3:51:39] <%Ranryu692> I almost beat this zone wearing just pants because I thought you had to have Light roll to be good
[3:51:40] <%CptCreampuff16> dont sit
[3:51:42] <Pokakaa> Paige turns to the eager wolves and just goes, "All right fuck it, is this what we doing?"
[3:51:43] <%FingaLights> WTF I missed this room@!@
[3:51:45] <+TopTieramisu> oops
[3:51:54] <%FacetiousAF> @FingaLights time to go back Kappa
[3:51:56] <+TopTieramisu> this is gonna get messy
[3:52:08] <Pokakaa> OOF
[3:52:12] <Pokakaa> Rip
[3:52:18] <+PrimalDweeb> It's interesting listening to both streams at the same time
[3:52:23] <+RedMaskBandit> This grace spot suck
[3:52:24] <%FingaLights> @FingaLights LUL I was certain I cleared this place up
[3:52:25] <@CreepyPorpoise> uh oh
[3:52:29] <$zyberion626> @PeachSaliva you DO NOT want to go back out the same door now
[3:52:29] <@CreepyPorpoise> cunning plans are dangerous
[3:52:29] <%AncelDeLambert> is it very cunning, Baldrick?
[3:52:35] <%Jackgar> Might as well keep pumping that strength until you have enough for the big boy sword
[3:52:36] <Pokakaa> Just as Peach's ass relaxed on the concrete, she saw the message
[3:52:49] <%Jackgar> You'll have to open the gate first
[3:52:52] <%CptCreampuff16> open the gate first
[3:52:59] <%Ranryu692> you can open the gate?
[3:53:01] <%Jackgar> You're like right next to the gate lever
[3:53:02] <Shockmaster182> Bouncing between you, pat, and woolie is crazy in regards to how drastically different things are in each stream
[3:53:04] <%FingaLights> "OPEN THA GAATEE!!"
[3:53:12] <%Ranryu692> I missed this whole part of the castle LUL
[3:53:12] <%Jackgar> It's like one room over from the grace
[3:53:13] <jetpack_rorschasch> Whatever you say Baldric Kappa
[3:53:19] <studleydoorite> Paige didn't go in through the main gate? but I thought she was big and strong...
[3:53:21] <+TopTieramisu> everyone's streaming
[3:53:32] <Pokakaa> I wonder if I turn on Pat's stream at the same time if I'll be able to clearly understand the background talking of them.
[3:53:39] <%Bloomingzonda> Paige just got done streaming her Pee
[3:53:41] <+imthewisejanitor> Literally all the cool kids are doing it.
[3:54:05] <%Jackgar> So for funsies after I cleared this whole area out I walked back in through the main gate
[3:54:08] <%Jackgar> It was amusing
[3:54:11] <%Jackgar> Nah I mean where you were
[3:54:19] <%Jackgar> The grace you just unlocked
[3:54:26] <%Jackgar> The front gate lever was right next to you
[3:54:48] <%Jackgar> OOf
[3:54:50] <%FacetiousAF> üëÄ
[3:54:51] <+TopTieramisu> they be lookin
[3:54:57] <%Sotetsu> fmgS
[3:55:16] <%CptCreampuff16> this is better so you can take out the balista guys
[3:55:26] <%Jackgar> This weapon has a great jumping R1
[3:55:33] <%Jackgar> Because it's LONG BOI
[3:55:41] <Shockmaster182> Little gremlins of the night
[3:55:47] <%Bloomingzonda> this makes me think of when my pet rats hear a wrapper. They chase me to the ends of the earth
[3:55:54] <Shockmaster182> Devious critters
[3:56:00] <%CptCreampuff16> they only care about balista
[3:56:16] <Pokakaa> Sneaky stabby sword.
[3:56:20] <%Jackgar> Their job is to man the ballista, and dammit, they're going to do their job!
[3:56:23] <+RedMaskBandit> Shame that u cant use the ballista
[3:56:37] <+TopTieramisu> i feel like i've rarely seen their wind attacks
[3:56:40] <Pokakaa> The size of an adolescent child. Quieter than a dagger.
[3:57:16] <%CptCreampuff16> yea
[3:57:16] <%Jackgar> Yes
[3:57:21] <%Jackgar> They won't attack unless you're engaged
[3:57:24] <+TopTieramisu> i think it's so that you can get a sneaky backstab
[3:57:24] <suddenlyscorched> You can probably just lump all of them
[3:57:31] <+RedMaskBandit> Yaaaaaaas queen
[3:57:33] <%Jackgar> Presumably so they don't accidentally aggro
[3:57:34] <%Ranryu692> @Jackgar But she's engaged to Pat
[3:57:48] <%Jackgar> You could just book it to the grace :p
[3:57:48] <%Bloomingzonda> Try Finger But Hole
[3:57:48] <Aussie_Manny> khadKEK AWOOOOOO
[3:58:00] <OldOnyx> They're good bois and wont bite unless provoked
[3:58:06] <Shockmaster182> No maidens?
[3:58:08] <%Ranryu692> I like wolves personally because they can distract a bunch of people
[3:58:17] <%Jackgar> Bork bork
[3:58:18] <Pokakaa> It's so interesting to see the Dark Souls formula converted to open world. I love when game formats are BotW'd as opposed to always intended for open world.
[3:58:25] <+SWFanatic> psaBork
[3:58:30] <%Jackgar> Go to the grace
[3:58:33] <Aussie_Manny> khadKEK khadKEK khadKEK
[3:58:37] <frothybubble> yeah you can make it to the grace
[3:58:43] <Pokakaa> Turn the grace on.
[3:58:44] <%CptCreampuff16> dont sit
[3:58:48] <%Jackgar> Don't sit, just go to the room
[3:58:53] <+RedMaskBandit> Use wolves cuz they disspear
[3:58:53] <Pokakaa> Wait she already has it
[3:58:55] <Pokakaa> right?
[3:58:58] <Sunstalker> Push lever prompt
[3:58:58] <%Jackgar> BYeah you did
[3:59:13] <Pokakaa> Spooky shit
[3:59:14] <studleydoorite> hate it when I go somewhere and forget if I left the grace on
[3:59:26] <Sunstalker> Pls don't fall down before opening lever
[3:59:30] <+RedMaskBandit> Bye union wolves
[3:59:35] <%Jackgar> You have not
[3:59:40] <%Jackgar> Right there
[3:59:40] <Pokakaa> you walked past it
[3:59:43] <Pokakaa> it's giant
[3:59:43] <%Jackgar> It's big
[3:59:44] <Sunstalker> the big ass thing next to you
[4:00:03] <Pokakaa> I was thinking of a smaller lever too, Paige.
[4:00:05] <Shockmaster182> What class did Paige start with?
[4:00:08] <%Jackgar> It's a different kind of lever than every other lever in the game, to be fair
[4:00:24] <Pokakaa> My expectations of what it will look like often blind me to what it will ACTUALLY look like a lot. Like paige :D
[4:00:33] <Pokakaa> F
[4:00:37] <%Ranryu692> lol
[4:00:39] <jetpack_rorschasch> Wolfs Kappa
[4:00:44] <OldOnyx> rip
[4:00:52] <+RedMaskBandit> PokBlaziken FlipThis
[4:00:56] <%Jackgar> SO do you want to do some PLATFORMING?!
[4:00:58] <Shockmaster182> F
[4:01:09] <jetpack_rorschasch> Opps
[4:01:20] <Pokakaa> The forbidden strat
[4:01:24] <%tentavision> now you know how we feel about coke
[4:01:35] <$zyberion626> once per boss/encounter
[4:01:36] <jetpack_rorschasch> I do it to Paige, it‚Äôs fine
[4:01:38] <frothybubble> once per encounter i think?
[4:01:39] <+CalderGaming> the pat is angered
[4:01:39] <%Ranryu692> only one per
[4:01:39] <%AncelDeLambert> once per area, yeah
[4:01:40] <%Sotetsu> I've per attempt
[4:01:47] <%Sotetsu> *Once
[4:01:48] <Sunstalker> Once per encounter? But you can summon as many different ashes as you can spar the fp?
[4:01:52] <+RedMaskBandit> 1st per summonable zone
[4:01:53] <+CalderGaming> the pat is jubilant
[4:01:59] <Pokakaa> I still don't entirely know what the blue flask does. Never used it. People tell me it does useful things, not sure. Idk.
[4:02:11] <Pokakaa> Sticking to red tho.
[4:02:15] <+CalderGaming> I have no idea but I can hear Pat, that's all I know
[4:02:21] <%AncelDeLambert> yes
[4:02:23] <%Jackgar> Correct
[4:02:23] <Pokakaa> Lol I was joking
[4:02:24] <+TopTieramisu> it's fp
[4:02:24] <%Jackgar> Okay so
[4:02:34] <%Jackgar> Go back to that staircase you jsut went up
[4:02:38] <%Jackgar> And look down and to the right
[4:02:42] <%vivaciouseff> if you've enough FP, i think you can summon different ashes, but once the ashes are dead it can't be resummoned until you sit
[4:02:50] <+RedMaskBandit> Union wolves get like 2 mins then they gotta go on break.
[4:02:54] <%Jackgar> This is where you came in
[4:02:56] <%CptCreampuff16> thats where you started
[4:03:05] <%Jackgar> No I mean next to the grace
[4:03:29] <Pokakaa> I'm just saying, when is Miyazaki gonna hit his cowboy phase and give us Dark Spurs?
[4:03:32] <Sunstalker> That man is now a merchant btw, Paige
[4:03:40] <%Jackgar> Okay so, the stairs to your left
[4:03:54] <%Jackgar> It's VERY sneaky
[4:03:55] <Pokakaa> Or Cow Souls, whatever.
[4:04:28] <Pokakaa> Oh is that how you're supposed to get that?
[4:04:28] <%Jackgar> There are so many little nooks and crannies like that, I love it
[4:04:42] <Pokakaa> I don't remember doing that...
[4:04:43] <%FacetiousAF> aye aye aye i'm a little butterfly
[4:04:49] <OldOnyx> good bois deserve union pawtection for collective borkening power
[4:04:53] <Aussie_Manny> Is Paige going to squat-walk the entire time?
[4:04:59] <cartakus> The only real thing I wish from added was a percent meter of events and items founds per area
[4:05:01] <Pokakaa> Oh god that song is good.
[4:05:13] <Pokakaa> I have never listened to it and I still know exactly what it is.
[4:05:14] <%FacetiousAF> I CAN SQUAT WALK TO GET AN ASS
[4:05:18] <%FacetiousAF> BRB
[4:05:20] <Pokakaa> Yes
[4:05:23] <jetpack_rorschasch> Try finger in nooks and crannies Kappa
[4:05:25] <%Jackgar> Barbell Hip Thrusts are what you want to get that booty game up
[4:05:27] <Aussie_Manny> lol
[4:05:40] <%Jackgar> This was just for some extra items
[4:05:58] <Pokakaa> Wait till that person finds out you can put a band around your knees while you do it.
[4:05:58] <%Bloomingzonda> Doing kegels increases your robustness stat
[4:06:04] <%CptCreampuff16> warp
[4:06:07] <%Jackgar> You teleport to a grace that's how :p
[4:06:17] <Pokakaa> Doing kegels increases your vitality stat.
[4:06:25] <%Jackgar> Want to do some platforming?
[4:06:30] <cartakus> Yes
[4:06:38] <%Jackgar> Top left
[4:06:40] <%CptCreampuff16> yes
[4:06:43] <Pokakaa> "Wanna use the dodgy jump system?"
[4:06:44] <Aussie_Manny> sure
[4:06:50] <%Bloomingzonda> you like jazz
[4:06:50] <%Jackgar> Yuuup
[4:06:57] <theghosttcatt> you like snake jazz?
[4:06:58] <heartlesshealer> Oh boy Rampart Tower
[4:07:09] <%Jackgar> I SCOURED this whole area like crazy
[4:07:09] <%CptCreampuff16> equip some throwing daggers if you have any for birds
[4:07:14] <%FacetiousAF> snazz if you will
[4:07:19] <Pokakaa> I love that this game has shown the world just how awful it would be if Devil May Cry did not have a double jump.
[4:07:20] <%Jackgar> No not these guys
[4:07:22] <%Jackgar> Don't worry
[4:07:23] <theghosttcatt> XD
[4:07:26] <%AncelDeLambert> it's near
[4:07:27] <ken_kuma> We strength building by the way?
[4:07:32] <%Jackgar> Well there is some
[4:07:32] <%AncelDeLambert> Paige, throw a bomb to blow up the birds
[4:07:46] <%Bloomingzonda> towards birds but down
[4:07:48] <Pokakaa> Battle hammer?
[4:07:53] <Pokakaa> Do I hear a battle hammer?
[4:07:57] <+TopTieramisu> yeah, your fp bar is quite small
[4:08:00] <ken_kuma> Shit, I'm spellswording and I'd kill to have that health bar
[4:08:02] <%Jackgar> There are two, here and another way
[4:08:40] <Pokakaa> This is where that light crossbow comes in handy
[4:08:46] <TehMud> Bird's the Word
[4:08:49] <%Jackgar> This weapon is a long boi so you may be able to handle them now
[4:09:02] <+TopTieramisu> flock off
[4:09:10] <Pokakaa> One thing I will say is that this game makes it very hard to remember where things are. Does anyone remember how they picked up anything that wasn't a super strong weapon?
[4:09:16] <theghosttcatt> i want  to kill the person who put swords on dem murderbirds
[4:09:34] <+CalderGaming> put that on her big giant memorial sword out by the side of the road. "Eh, fuck it. - some Tarnished"
[4:09:47] <TehMud> Tis just a scratch
[4:09:50] <+TopTieramisu> @theghosttcatt miyazaki chuckles somewhere but doesn't know why
[4:09:53] <DusK_The_Stray> I don't even remember where I picked up my super strong weapon
[4:09:54] <%CptCreampuff16> you can jump down there
[4:10:03] <%Jackgar> There's stuff on the other side of that bridge, too
[4:10:15] <%AncelDeLambert> remember your rainbow stones
[4:10:20] <%Jackgar> No I mean if you cross the whole thing
[4:10:54] <%Jackgar> I'm not sure what that guy was thinking :p
[4:11:06] <%FacetiousAF> CRONCH
[4:11:08] <+TopTieramisu> your life flashed before your eyes
[4:11:11] <%Jackgar> Okay so that wasn't just the stream then
[4:11:14] <%CptCreampuff16> follow messages they are friend
[4:11:39] <cartakus> Jesus I did not find that
[4:11:52] <cartakus> wair...
[4:11:56] <+TopTieramisu> i'm starting to regret playing this in offline mode
[4:12:03] <%CptCreampuff16> ok there is an enemy ahead you might wanna just run past them first then come back
[4:12:18] <%AncelDeLambert> stoooooones
[4:12:21] <%Jackgar> Yes there is a way
[4:12:34] <%Jackgar> Hug the wall
[4:12:36] <studleydoorite> spend it wisely
[4:12:36] <%AncelDeLambert> you can craft them real easy
[4:12:45] <+TopTieramisu> maybe you can craft more
[4:12:56] <%Jackgar> So you don't fall off :p
[4:13:00] <%AncelDeLambert> ... try jumping up and down on this ledge, please
[4:13:05] <Aussie_Manny> TakeNRG hug wall
[4:13:10] <jetpack_rorschasch> Isn‚Äôt there some hacking issues with the online modes on PC and PS5?
[4:13:18] <%Jackgar> Drop a stone there
[4:13:20] <Aussie_Manny> i don't like it
[4:13:22] <Justlaxy> not a good jump
[4:13:24] <cartakus> kid laugh?
[4:13:25] <+TopTieramisu> copium
[4:13:26] <Pokakaa> Anyone else really appreciating the touches George RR Martin has brought to this game's lore?
[4:13:31] <%Jackgar> Now is the time
[4:13:32] <%AncelDeLambert> well check your craft list, then
[4:13:39] <%AncelDeLambert> LUL
[4:13:46] <Pokakaa> F
[4:13:50] <%Ranryu692> you can craft them if you have ruin fragments
[4:13:50] <%AncelDeLambert> there ya go
[4:13:55] <%AncelDeLambert> YOU HAVE COTTON
[4:13:56] <TehMud> LUL
[4:13:59] <+TopTieramisu> @Pokakaa the scarlet rot and caelid kinda remind me of the north and the encroaching winter
[4:14:05] <Pokakaa> Hey it's okay, I've never even interacted with the crafting system.
[4:14:11] <%AncelDeLambert> and that's why I told you to jump in place
[4:14:14] <+PrimalDweeb> LUL
[4:14:14] <%Jackgar> I barely use the crafting, so I don't blame you :p
[4:14:14] <jetpack_rorschasch> Close your eyes and jump. Trust in the you that trusts fate!
[4:14:15] <studleydoorite> hold on I think you survived
[4:14:16] <%Jackgar> Okay so
[4:14:17] <MrMoonGoose> Unfortunate\
[4:14:18] <Pokakaa> @TopTieramisu Yeah, I know right? I like how much more alive the world feels.
[4:14:20] <%Jackgar> If you stayed there
[4:14:28] <%Jackgar> You would have landed on the platform when it crumbled
[4:14:52] <%Jackgar> Also you can run past where all the birds are to the opposite tower
[4:14:52] <%AncelDeLambert> down there? Yeah.
[4:15:01] <%AncelDeLambert> or.... kinda? yeah
[4:15:15] <%Jackgar> Hooray for jumping attack!
[4:15:43] <%AncelDeLambert> I believe you can craft Cotton, Paige, which lowers fall damage
[4:15:49] <%AncelDeLambert> try the middle, that's where I go
[4:16:46] <ken_kuma> I believed
[4:16:49] <%Jackgar> It was silent, too
[4:16:54] <%AncelDeLambert> about a minute? I think
[4:17:26] <jetpack_rorschasch> PogChamp
[4:17:35] <%Jackgar> Oh hey it's your souls

[4:20:39] <+imthewisejanitor> LUL LUL LUL
[4:20:41] <%AncelDeLambert> so you need to fall ON that ledge. Straight on.
[4:20:43] <suddenlyscorched> Holy shit

[4:20:48] <%CptCreampuff16> stand in the center and jump
[4:20:58] <%Jackgar> It's super weird, I know
[4:21:15] <%Pukenasty> learning with paige
[4:21:18] <%FingaLights> I think the cotton is messing her up? That didn't look right
[4:21:30] <%AncelDeLambert> for the birds, Paige, craft some bomb pots and throw them.
[4:21:32] <+TopTieramisu> i want to see miyazaki's take on a pure platformer game
[4:21:41] <+imthewisejanitor> Is there anything that birds in this game DON'T attack you with??
[4:21:42] <studleydoorite> these birds aren't even real
[4:21:45] <%Jackgar> This weapon smokes the birds so good
[4:21:47] <%king_wragles> @AncelDeLambert she might not have that item actually
[4:21:56] <+CalderGaming> I see I was right to have fire arrows for those birds every time I went that way
[4:22:24] <%AncelDeLambert> now JUMP down, not roll
[4:22:35] <%AncelDeLambert> yes
[4:22:36] <%Ranryu692> yes
[4:22:40] <%AncelDeLambert> ONTO the platform

[4:23:15] <%AncelDeLambert> that's the spear art the knights use

[4:23:20] <%CptCreampuff16> ok do not fight the enemy up ahead run past first then come back
[4:23:23] <%AncelDeLambert> no more falling

[4:35:41] <%CptCreampuff16> you can go up pillar too
[4:35:56] <%Jackgar> There are two or three whole-ass routes from here, but both can get you on progression
[4:36:29] <%Jackgar> This castle is SO GOOD
[4:36:40] <%Jackgar> (It didn't actually take 12 years to make, that was an RLM joke)
[4:36:40] <+imthewisejanitor> "It took 12 years to make!"
[4:36:43] <+CalderGaming> Paige the 12 years thing was a RLM joke
[4:36:56] <%wizard_of_diamonds> Get tricked lol

[4:55:24] <%AncelDeLambert> there's an imp door nearby, but there's a way to get around it without a key. Anyone remember how?
[4:56:07] <%AncelDeLambert> I'm trying to remember how to drop down behind the door, but coming up blank
[4:56:13] <%Dakuu75> I've had to come here to farm birds, for arrow materials. is there a better spot? (if anyone knows)

[4:57:38] <%AncelDeLambert> she should do that later
[4:57:39] <vicar_anat> Executed with impunity!
[4:57:42] <+RedMaskBandit> Its like u went into a pot daycare
[4:57:46] <%Dakuu75> they were orphans for, all of 1 minute... and then we killed them too.
[4:57:50] <%AncelDeLambert> actually, I should shut up

[4:59:11] <%Jackgar> She did
[4:59:32] <%AncelDeLambert> cool, she found out herself
[5:00:15] <%Jackgar> It's a tight jump
[5:00:20] <%Dakuu75> so hard to see in here at night
[5:00:21] <+RedMaskBandit> Has she seeketh grace?
[5:00:31] <+Teilwal> The jumping skills of an Italian plumber
[5:00:37] <+Bailey__Gaming> use lantern!
[5:00:44] <%AncelDeLambert> just a jump, I think
[5:00:51] <%CptCreampuff16> before going foward mgith wanna finish exploring the lower floor
[5:00:57] <%Bloomingzonda> Someone just posted a no death run of this game where they beat it in 2.5 hours
[5:00:58] <%AncelDeLambert> yaaaay
[5:01:07] <+Teilwal> im proud of you son
[5:01:13] <%Dakuu75> bull shit
[5:01:20] <%Dakuu75> hacks
[5:01:27] <%Jackgar> Yeah you apparently don't need to kill many bosses in this game to finish it
[5:01:29] <Aussie_Manny> The main story can be done in 2.5 hours?! Bruh.
[5:01:45] <+Bailey__Gaming> how many mandatory bosses are there
[5:01:50] <Aussie_Manny> I mean, the main story won't be my focus once I get this game. I'mma explore! 2020Snacking
[5:01:52] <%Bloomingzonda> yeah you only have to kill like 5 enemies to beat the game
[5:01:53] <Sunstalker> Yeah there's some broken magic builds that delete bosses
[5:02:00] <+RedMaskBandit> Nah more like ''swimming'' in Sekiro
[5:02:00] <%imthewisejanitor> "completely," eh...
[5:02:07] <FeralFozzie> im guessing thats not a 100% completion run
[5:02:17] <+CalderGaming> the one friend I know who beat the game did it in 51 hours and easily didn't do everything
[5:02:22] <%rumtumtugnutz> Like how you can technically beat Prey in 11 minutes
[5:02:32] <+Teilwal> can you invade Pat and do him a murder?
[5:03:01] <cartakus> god I'm 60 hours in and I think I fucked up so many npc quests
[5:03:03] <Aussie_Manny> haha
[5:03:05] <+CalderGaming> can you only invade players with a finger remedy active?
[5:03:07] <Sunstalker> He'd have to summon first which he won't
[5:03:08] <%Bloomingzonda> There is a speedrun where you beat every fallout game except 76 in an hour and a half
[5:03:11] <Aussie_Manny> what platform is Woolie on?
[5:03:25] <+Teilwal> a fight stick
[5:03:25] <%Jackgar> Also Pat probably has very big numbers right now
[5:03:37] <jetpack_rorschasch> The laminations of the orb!
[5:03:39] <+Ne1son> He's on PC
[5:03:41] <+Ne1son> isnt he
[5:03:42] <%imthewisejanitor> Oh shit, Pat is literally being double-teamed right now.
[5:03:47] <Kain5707> he swapped to PS5
[5:03:51] <%AncelDeLambert> yeyeye big shield big bois
[5:04:06] <+Teilwal> dual weild shields
[5:04:07] <%AncelDeLambert> fatty
[5:04:08] <%Jackgar> BIG HEAVY
[5:04:13] <+CalderGaming> woolie said on the last podcast that the PC version gave him too much technical grief so he moved to ps5
[5:04:17] <%AncelDeLambert> you can dump some armor
[5:04:24] <+Ne1son> Fatty roll
[5:04:25] <%AncelDeLambert> take that helmet off
[5:04:28] <+RedMaskBandit> That's hot
[5:04:32] <%AncelDeLambert> ooooooh pretty
[5:04:33] <%Bloomingzonda> put the hood on
[5:04:34] <%Jackgar> I mean you already have a 100% physical reduction shield, don't you?
[5:04:49] <%AncelDeLambert> just straight unequip the arms
[5:04:51] <+Bailey__Gaming> How's your PC version runnjng? mine is p borked if to much is happening
[5:04:54] <Kain5707> still fat
[5:04:55] <+Teilwal> what if naked and 2 shields
[5:04:59] <%Jackgar> It'll tell you on the bottom right
[5:05:00] <%AncelDeLambert> yeeeeeaaaah
[5:05:02] <%CptCreampuff16> if you change youre gonna wanna change its skill so you can use weapon art
[5:05:24] <Kain5707> there was a patch today
[5:05:25] <%Bloomingzonda> @PeachSaliva the panel on the right side of the equipment screen tells you what load you are at
[5:05:26] <+cvp5127> BIG
[5:05:28] <%AncelDeLambert> @PeachSaliva so that shield I believe has a bash, so you'll have to put the no skill ash on it for your sword
[5:05:38] <%SveriSageAdvice> they put out a patch that made the game run better at least for me, so im already fairly happy
[5:05:46] <%Jackgar> Yeah that shield takes away your L2 unless you ash it out
[5:06:01] <%AncelDeLambert> sweet
[5:06:12] <%AncelDeLambert> that's a dev message
[5:06:13] <Sunstalker> Paige, are you deadset on curved greaytswords or would you enjoy a Flamberge possibly?
[5:06:13] <%Jackgar> It's cool, but is it as cool as the flipping and dipping?
[5:06:26] <%AncelDeLambert> rainbow stoooooones
[5:06:42] <%AncelDeLambert> you can walk on that, it's cool
[5:07:37] <%AncelDeLambert> jumping WAS required ahead

[5:08:26] <%rumtumtugnutz> Don't do it Paige
[5:08:39] <%AncelDeLambert> I mean, it'd be fine if you did
[5:08:47] <%CptCreampuff16> more platforming

[5:09:36] <%AncelDeLambert> this coming area is a fuck, but it's so worth it
[5:09:40] <%Bloomingzonda> The description on those leaves weirds me out
[5:09:44] <%Jackgar> It's honestly insane how much stuff there is in just this one castle
[5:09:53] <%imthewisejanitor> I keep watching Pat die on his stream, but then listening to see if I can hear him yelling in the background of Paige's stream.
[5:10:58] <+Ne1son> Platforming master
[5:11:15] <%Sotetsu> This area is so flipping huge
[5:12:01] <%Bloomingzonda> Fun fact a group of rats is called a mischief
[5:12:16] <%CptCreampuff16> now you make the rules
[5:12:19] <jetpack_rorschasch> He makes all of tha rules!
[5:12:20] <%Jackgar> LONG SWOOOOORD
[5:12:20] <%Sotetsu> "He makes all the rules." LUL
[5:12:37] <%Jackgar> It's not quite as girthy, but it's quite long and curves juuuust the right direction
[5:13:13] <+ThomasOfTroy> There's a max on how long twitch streams can run
[5:13:14] <jetpack_rorschasch> Kappa
[5:13:19] <%Bloomingzonda> you have to restart stream every 48 hours on twitch
[5:13:19] <+ThomasOfTroy> So she has to restart it ev ery so often
[5:13:19] <%Sotetsu> Title still says Day 28
[5:13:20] <@SoFarFetched> Its day 28 of it
[5:13:26] <%imthewisejanitor> What journey?
[5:13:32] <+RedMaskBandit> It just works you

[5:14:37] <+RedMaskBandit> Oh i thought that was normal?
[5:14:44] <%AncelDeLambert> use your heaviest damage weapon
[5:14:46] <%CptCreampuff16> bloodhound
[5:14:49] <$rdark_ksu> Time to grip it and rip it!!!!
[5:14:55] <adamdavid101> You got this little red riding hood! big sword big swing.
[5:14:57] <%Sotetsu> Pat one shot this boss, so it's gotta be easy. psaSmug

[5:15:00] <%CptCreampuff16> bleed does big damages to bosses
[5:15:03] <Kain5707> bleed
[5:15:14] <%Jackgar> Yup
[5:15:15] <%CptCreampuff16> yes
[5:15:17] <%Bloomingzonda> having the second sword raises your load
[5:15:20] <+Ne1son> Yeah in the passive effects
[5:15:21] <%AncelDeLambert> unequip that other sword, it's too heavy
[5:15:44] <%CptCreampuff16> you can put glvose on
[5:15:45] <+Ne1son> Consider the load
[5:15:48] <%Jackgar> Remember it tells you if you're medium or fat on the right
[5:15:55] <%AncelDeLambert> can you summon here?
[5:16:09] <+Ne1son> Jelly if you can
[5:16:09] <%AncelDeLambert> I don't think so, I don't remember
[5:16:17] <%imthewisejanitor> Always consider your load KappaHD
[5:16:20] <%Jackgar> You'll need to top off your fp to summon
[5:16:32] <%CptCreampuff16> torch added weight but you dont need it since you have lantern
[5:16:49] <%Sotetsu> Dont give up, skeleton
[5:16:59] <+tumzfestival> No style, no grace
[5:16:59] <%AncelDeLambert> it's close enough
[5:16:59] <%Jackgar> When you see a GIGANTIC chunk of his life just suddenly disappear, that means you've bled them
[5:17:04] <%AncelDeLambert> you opened that shortcut
[5:17:06] <+Ne1son> Youre good
[5:17:08] <cartakus> oh THIS

[5:19:54] <CoyoteZappaVII> big slnky boy
[5:20:10] <%AncelDeLambert> got greedy
[5:20:11] <%Jackgar> Awwww
[5:20:12] <%Sotetsu> So close!
[5:20:12] <+RedMaskBandit> Does her potion not heal?
[5:20:15] <%Jackgar> Literally like 1 hit
[5:20:17] <%CptCreampuff16> dont roll focus on blocking
[5:20:23] <+Ne1son> Don't give up skeleton
[5:20:40] <$rdark_ksu> such is Souls
[5:20:46] <%Jackgar> Why changing the weapon?
[5:20:48] <%CptCreampuff16> sit at grace and mix potion
[5:20:50] <jetpack_rorschasch> What is this, Monster Hunter or something!
[5:21:06] <%Jackgar> One with HP regen perhaps?
[5:21:06] <+RedMaskBandit> Nah, u have a flask and a potion
[5:21:10] <%CptCreampuff16> mix wonderous physick
[5:21:16] <%Jackgar> Yeah
[5:21:24] <%Ranryu692> Paige you haven't been using your Physick???
[5:21:29] <%Jackgar> The regen one is nice
[5:21:30] <%CptCreampuff16> chose 2 you like
[5:21:42] <CoyoteZappaVII> follow your heart
[5:21:49] <%AncelDeLambert> yes, two are used
[5:21:56] <$rdark_ksu> You need a Potion of Flatulence +4
[5:21:59] <%Jackgar> It's a custom potion that you can pick two effects
[5:22:01] <+RedMaskBandit> Health is really good
[5:22:08] <%Jackgar> They don't go away, you can change them freely
[5:22:13] <%Jackgar> So the tears aren't consumed
[5:22:20] <%SveriSageAdvice> charge and strength might be pretty alright
[5:22:26] <%CptCreampuff16> you have a custom potion in your inventory called wonderous physic when you drink it it gives you the effects you chose
[5:22:36] <%Jackgar> All the crystal tears are permanent and can be swapped however you like
[5:22:45] <%Ranryu692> the Physick might be the game's best addition? certainly a contender anyway
[5:22:58] <%Jackgar> Crimsonburst gives you regen which is nice
[5:23:05] <%SveriSageAdvice> there is another tear later that combined with the charged attack one that can make this busted for you lol
[5:23:17] <+Ne1son> Yeah
[5:23:18] <%CptCreampuff16> yeah]
[5:23:20] <%Jackgar> Yup
[5:23:25] <%Jackgar> You're good to go
[5:23:53] <+RedMaskBandit> U Gucci
[5:23:54] <+Ne1son> nope
[5:23:55] <%Bloomingzonda> HONK
[5:23:56] <+Ne1son> other way
[5:24:02] <+Ne1son> west
[5:24:03] <+RedMaskBandit> No u
[5:24:05] <Kain5707> you only get 1 chug per bonfire though
[5:24:14] <%Bloomingzonda> right
[5:24:24] <+Ne1son> yeah
[5:24:26] <+Ne1son> down
[5:24:29] <%Bloomingzonda> down
[5:24:32] <%Bloomingzonda> back
[5:24:47] <%Jackgar> Yeah unlike the blue and red potions, you don't get one back for killing enemy groups in the overworld
[5:24:58] <+Ne1son> all the way down
[5:25:23] <%AncelDeLambert> use your knives from above, then
[5:25:25] <%Bloomingzonda> Bats are rat angels
[5:25:44] <%Jackgar> Why did you switch back from the bloodhound fang?
[5:25:57] <%CptCreampuff16> you can run past rat
[5:26:19] <%AncelDeLambert> oh no, he makes da rules!
[5:26:39] <+Ne1son> bloodhound is stronger
[5:26:39] <%CptCreampuff16> its not
[5:26:43] <%Jackgar> You are correct
[5:26:46] <%AncelDeLambert> it's the bleed, the bleed does huge damage
[5:26:56] <%Jackgar> Each level you put into special weapons like the Fang is a MUCH higher increase
[5:27:03] <%CptCreampuff16> blood hound is stonger since you upgraded it
[5:27:11] <%Jackgar> One level of the special weapons that need somber tears gives like +20 or higher boosts
[5:27:12] <%AncelDeLambert> if you die again, try putting the no skill ash on the greatshield
[5:27:19] <Kain5707> do you have 2 curved swords you can dual-weild?
[5:27:22] <%AncelDeLambert> RIGHT HERE
[5:27:25] <%SveriSageAdvice> right there
[5:27:27] <%Jackgar> Take it right now
[5:27:28] <%SveriSageAdvice> before fight
[5:27:36] <%AncelDeLambert> like three minutes
[5:27:37] <%Jackgar> A while
[5:27:38] <%SveriSageAdvice> lasts for a BIT
[5:27:38] <%Bloomingzonda> Does anyone else feel older any time they see that they are remaking a movie that came out while you were alive
[5:27:48] <%Jackgar> Probably the amount of time you'll spend in the fight
[5:27:56] <Kain5707> the shield is only 1 hit though
[5:27:58] <%AncelDeLambert> GET THE DICK GET THE DICK
[5:28:14] <%OctaivianRex> Pretty funny that Woolie and her are using the same sword.

[5:43:30] <%Bloomingzonda> that is just a normal dude paige you have fought a bunch
[5:43:30] <%CptCreampuff16> you can run around him
[5:43:31] <%Ranryu692> *path
[5:43:45] <%Jackgar> Although honestly she'd probably smoke this big dude
[5:43:47] <BigFingerRo> Pussy noballs, hides from the boss
[5:43:52] <%Jackgar> Especially with that weapon
[5:44:03] <%Jackgar> But he's got other little dudes with him
[5:45:43] <%CptCreampuff16> tbh i feel like shell kill the boss first try if she summons cool lady
[5:46:04] <%AncelDeLambert> if you want to avoid Big Man, I can tell you how
[5:46:09] <%Jackgar> Nah that's just a big dude
[5:46:12] <someweirdo227> yep
[5:46:13] <%CptCreampuff16> yep
[5:46:14] <%Dakuu75> yep

[5:46:45] <%AncelDeLambert> up the elevator
[5:46:47] <%Dakuu75> should be safety right behind that troll
[5:46:50] <someweirdo227> to the left past the troll
[5:46:53] <%Ranryu692> up the elevator from the grace site
[5:46:54] <%Bloomingzonda> There is a bonfire right behind the troll
[5:46:56] <phtephe_> Run past the troll and take a right when in the tunnel
[5:46:57] <%CptCreampuff16> go back to grace and up elevator
[5:47:17] <%Ranryu692> either works
[5:47:18] <+funya_rinpa> you could just run past them and the first right is a grace
[5:47:22] <phtephe_> Yep
[5:47:23] <+funya_rinpa> yeah
[5:47:24] <%Dakuu75> you can't miss it. if you run past him, you'll see
[5:47:25] <%Bloomingzonda> yeah
[5:47:25] <%CptCreampuff16> you could do that tpp
[5:47:25] <+RedMaskBandit> Its both the same grace
[5:47:27] <%CptCreampuff16> too
[5:47:27] <someweirdo227> yeah
[5:47:27] <%AncelDeLambert> that's one way
[5:47:29] <%Jackgar> You could sneak past him or just run right past him
[5:47:32] <%Ranryu692> yeah, that fire in the tunnel should be next to the door
[5:47:33] <+dane332> hello!
[5:47:49] <%Jackgar> Outplayed
[5:47:51] <%AncelDeLambert> sweet
[5:47:53] <someweirdo227> You...did it
[5:47:58] <%AncelDeLambert> and now... you can summon Wife
[5:48:02] <%CptCreampuff16> do you wanna summon cool lady for boss?
[5:48:13] <%Bloomingzonda> Yeah do that summon before boss
[5:48:20] <%Ranryu692> yes
[5:48:21] <%AncelDeLambert> YES
[5:48:21] <%Dakuu75> yes, summon her
[5:48:22] <+CalderGaming> summon her

[5:48:32] <%Ranryu692> no reason not to use NPC summons?
[5:48:33] <%AncelDeLambert> hells yeah
[5:48:39] <+CalderGaming> also don't worry about having to keep her alive through the whole fight
[5:48:41] <%Jackgar> It does increase the boss' HP, but an extra distraction is helpful
[5:48:42] <+dane332> i actually never met her so i never got to summon her lol
[5:49:05] <%Jackgar> Awww yeah, dual wielding axes!
[5:49:08] <jetpack_rorschasch> When you put those words together, it sounds like a pretty raunchy time! Kappa
[5:49:14] <BigFingerRo> lemme in on those balls girl, I mean, cmon
[5:49:20] <xxHungryxx> No ash summons?
[5:49:20] <+dane332> LETS GOOOO
[5:49:27] <%Jackgar> You can also still summon wolves, although I would save that for when he starts getting angry
[5:49:35] <+dane332> you got this i believe!

[5:53:36] <jetpack_rorschasch> PowerUpL YouDontSay PowerUpR
[5:53:46] <%Jackgar> Tell Pat you beat Godrick first try no problem
[5:53:52] <%Bloomingzonda> Pat spent like an hour on him

[5:53:57] <heartlesshealer> tell him
[5:54:00] <%Jackgar> Don't teleport away, there's more stuff past him

[5:54:09] <@SoFarFetched> youR PENIS
[5:54:10] <%Jackgar> Yeah....you're SUPER beefed up
[5:54:10] <@SoFarFetched> Kappa
[5:54:13] <Kain5707> bleed is so OP
[5:54:14] <%Sotetsu> You are 30 levels higher than most people, I think.
[5:54:16] <@SoFarFetched> to show off to pat
[5:54:16] <Kain5707> its crazy
[5:54:17] <%AncelDeLambert> ... I can never remember his name
[5:54:19] <%CptCreampuff16> i mean you are really big
[5:54:34] <%Jackgar> That weapon MELTS him like crazy
[5:54:37] <%AncelDeLambert> oh, LUL you're about ten levels higher than I was when I beat him
[5:54:39] <someweirdo227> Mind let's you summon bigger boys
[5:54:52] <+CalderGaming> level 50 is definitely ez street for godrick
[5:55:01] <%CptCreampuff16> round table has new friends to meet
[5:55:02] <%Jackgar> Wanna hear something AWESOME now that you've beaten him?
[5:55:05] <+CalderGaming> again no shame
[5:55:18] <%AncelDeLambert> ah, there he is
[5:55:18] <%Jackgar> Margit is WAY tougher
[5:55:28] <%AncelDeLambert> yeah, he's easier than Margit
[5:55:33] <MelfinaStarwind> GG Paige!
[5:55:41] <%AncelDeLambert> he's the guy at the gate
[5:55:43] <%Ranryu692> ye
[5:55:48] <%Jackgar> Margit is so much tougher that there's an item you can buy specifically to make him easier
[5:55:55] <Savage_Howitzer> doomsnBIG doomsnPPspin
[5:56:04] <signofzeta> it's what's left of him
[5:56:08] <%CptCreampuff16> thats whats left over
[5:56:09] <%Jackgar> That's what's LEFT of Godrick
[5:56:12] <%Ranryu692> under his foot
[5:56:19] <%Jackgar> Remember how tiny his head was compared to the rest of his body
[5:56:36] <%SpencerSDH> You'll have to kill this guy to get access to his merchant goods. I would do it. It's interesting.
[5:56:37] <signofzeta> yeah it's probably his original body
[5:56:39] <$zyberion626> Screw this guy! He steaks runes whenever you die in the castle!
[5:56:41] <DancesWitBalrog> Ohh, she already beat Godfrey and i missed it!
[5:56:52] <+Ne1son> You should kill him
[5:56:53] <$zyberion626> *steals
[5:56:55] <%Jackgar> Okay so, remember how you called how we was Megatron?
[5:56:56] <+xXfuzzball64Xx> all he wants to do is stamp heads
[5:57:03] <%Jackgar> ....would you ALSO like to be Megatron?
[5:57:05] <DancesWitBalrog> dont kill him boo
[5:57:06] <Jetsfantasy> Whoops :)
[5:57:23] <%Jackgar> Because you can also be Megatron
[5:57:27] <%CptCreampuff16> to the round table
[5:57:29] <%AncelDeLambert> OH! Head back to the Round Table
[5:57:30] <%Ranryu692> well bring 2k souls with you to the round table
[5:57:34] <DancesWitBalrog> Time to use Great Rune to become more bigger and more stronger
[5:57:35] <%Jackgar> First finish up stuff here
[5:57:36] <%AncelDeLambert> there's things to see back at the hub
[5:57:39] <%Jackgar> Then go back to the round table
[5:57:44] <%Jackgar> Don't go there yet
[5:57:46] <%SpencerSDH> Kill him for his merchant goods.
[5:57:51] <%Jackgar> You have to do some stuff here
[5:57:57] <%Jackgar> Nah go through here first
[5:58:01] <DancesWitBalrog> dont kill him :(
[5:58:02] <%CptCreampuff16> just go back and sell extra armor
[5:58:05] <+Ne1son> kill
[5:58:05] <%robotoken> Megatron is fine but Optimus Primal is forever
[5:58:08] <%CptCreampuff16> you have duplicates
[5:58:09] <%SpencerSDH> You can't get them any other way unfortunately
[5:58:28] <%Dakuu75> yep
[5:58:31] <%AncelDeLambert> that's his throne
[5:58:42] <%Jackgar> "He seems nice" You wouldn't be saying that if you tried to enter the castle through the front gate :p
[5:58:44] <%Ranryu692> I was wondering if you could get in that way
[5:59:21] <+funya_rinpa> you can get in here early? i guess there really is nothing blocking the other end, that's funny
[5:59:35] <%AncelDeLambert> I mean, he does tell you not to
[5:59:46] <%AncelDeLambert> @funya_rinpa you can go around the side of the castle
[5:59:57] <%SpencerSDH> Yeah, you can access the entire map without killing the bosses.
[6:00:00] <%Jackgar> Yeah you can ask him to open the gate for you, and when you do he calls the guards on you and you get WRECKED by the front gate siege weapons
[6:00:08] <%SpencerSDH> As far as I know
[6:00:11] <%AncelDeLambert> there's a bridge with a Finger Reader on it to the south, and if you drop off it you can use a goat path to bypass the castle
[6:00:24] <%AncelDeLambert> give grape
[6:00:26] <%Jackgar> I HAVE NOT FOUND THIS LADY
[6:00:31] <CoyoteZappaVII> is that... her hair
[6:00:32] <%Dakuu75> yep
[6:00:43] <Kain5707> give her deez
[6:00:50] <leaplearning> uwu
[6:00:51] <BigFingerRo> maidenless?
[6:00:58] <xxHungryxx> @peachsaliva Should examine grapes
[6:01:00] <%Bloomingzonda> Yeah eat your eyeball you weirdo
[6:01:04] <jetpack_rorschasch> Bitches love my grapes!
[6:01:09] <@CreepyPorpoise> get that fingie blessing
[6:01:17] <%Jackgar> So yeah, new stuff at the round table!
[6:01:18] <%SpencerSDH> You need to clear out two locations for two halves of a key item to open up a progression blocker that can also be bypassed by story progress, but you can reach the whole map at the start.
[6:01:23] <%CptCreampuff16> you can sell your duplicate armors
[6:01:29] <%Bloomingzonda> @PeachSaliva you have so many duplicate items to sell
[6:01:58] <+doc_ock_rokc> @PeachSaliva Dont forget to DOUBLE TAP
[6:02:07] <%Jackgar> L1 attacks the left side when mounted
[6:02:50] <Kain5707> Paige did you know there are many skeleton summons
[6:02:54] <%SpencerSDH> @PeachSaliva I just learned that mounting and dismounting gives you iframes, so you can use it to get out of a bind if you time it right. 60 hours in btw.
[6:03:05] <%Jackgar> L2 also works the same way as R2 but on the other side, too
[6:03:22] <%CptCreampuff16> you can just go back and sell items
[6:04:08] <%CptCreampuff16> sell armor
[6:04:11] <%Jackgar> There is a lot more stuff here now
[6:04:24] <%Bloomingzonda> Yeah talk to everyone
[6:04:38] <someweirdo227> explore a bit too
[6:04:46] <%Jackgar> Sell some dupe armor
[6:04:46] <%Bloomingzonda> go to armor
[6:05:14] <%Jackgar> :O
[6:05:22] <%CptCreampuff16> 4 souls
[6:05:31] <%tentavision> armors for pussys who are afraid of needles
[6:05:32] <%CptCreampuff16> your 4 short

[6:05:48] <%thejimjamz> No bossom for peach
[6:06:04] <%basicpotato0> do the hug
[6:06:19] <%Jackgar> Downstairs might have some new stuff, too, but I forget if they're there yet
[6:06:38] <%CptCreampuff16> you can go to balcony, or past the edgy guy. theres also a new door opened
[6:06:47] <%Jackgar> It's fine
[6:06:50] <%Ranryu692> I gave it to him
[6:06:50] <%Bloomingzonda> give
[6:06:50] <$zyberion626> it's all good to give him
[6:06:54] <%Jackgar> The books just expand his shop
[6:06:55] <%SveriSageAdvice> there isnt a single one that causes bad ends like in DS3

[6:09:43] <+RedMaskBandit> if it was "Dark Souls 4" then this would be both Frampt and Karth with same body
[6:09:51] <tanarath> Those feel like roots from the tree
[6:10:00] <%Jackgar> The big, hairy, twitching, decaying fingers
[6:10:09] <%imthewisejanitor> I heartell Pat just showed booty on stream.
[6:10:15] <Giztech> @PeachSaliva Pat is fighting gargoyles naked lol
[6:10:19] <cartakus> rero rero rero rero
[6:10:32] <%Jackgar> So basically she's saying she's your boss weapon vendor
[6:10:38] <+CalderGaming> this is your boss soul
[6:10:48] <%Jackgar> This is how you can become Megatron
[6:10:52] <FeralFozzie> she's gonna give you the fingers
[6:11:13] <%Jackgar> but, hole
[6:11:35] <BigFingerRo> Is she gonna check for anal tone too?
[6:11:46] <@SoFarFetched> She should at least ask you out before she gives you the two fingers
[6:11:47] <%Jackgar> God's Prostate Exam
[6:11:48] <@SoFarFetched> geefThink
[6:11:56] <BigFingerRo> not with those 2 fingers, hopefully
[6:11:58] <%Bloomingzonda> If the fingers can get in you aint got no anal tone
[6:12:15] <%Jackgar> Basically Godrick was a huge poser
[6:12:24] <%imthewisejanitor> Anal tone. LUL
[6:12:25] <%CptCreampuff16> recive
[6:12:30] <%ItalianWaifu> seek seek lest
[6:12:31] <+vaderxyz1970> Fingers think they are better than everyone
[6:12:33] <BigFingerRo> @Bloomingzonda gotta dial again, if that's the case LUL
[6:12:36] <jetpack_rorschasch> Now bend over! WutFace
[6:12:42] <%Jackgar> MEGATRON TIME
[6:12:50] <%AncelDeLambert> so choose a boss soul
[6:12:51] <%SpencerSDH> Oh look. Boss weapons
[6:12:54] <%AncelDeLambert> you get runes
[6:12:54] <%SpencerSDH> SHit load of souls
[6:12:57] <%Ranryu692> you get tons of runes
[6:12:58] <%CptCreampuff16> you get souls
[6:13:00] <%SpencerSDH> runes
[6:13:00] <%Jackgar> So if you select it in this menu, you can pick one of these two weapons
[6:13:01] <%Ranryu692> just like in the old games
[6:13:01] <%Bloomingzonda> Same as the other games
[6:13:04] <%CptCreampuff16> same rules as boss souls
[6:13:06] <%Jackgar> One is his axe. The other is his dragon arm
[6:13:08] <someweirdo227> Eat for big souls or use to make weapon
[6:13:09] <Rolandknight> remember DS3
[6:13:12] <DancesWitBalrog> you can get that dragon weapon that Pat had
[6:13:12] <%SpencerSDH> maybe
[6:13:17] <someweirdo227> Dragon fist is pretty cool
[6:13:20] <%Ranryu692> do you want to have a dragon head for a hand?
[6:13:23] <Mikers29> you can duplicate these souls
[6:13:23] <someweirdo227> Become Megatron
[6:13:24] <Jetsfantasy> Souls
[6:13:24] <%CptCreampuff16> its cool
[6:13:25] <tanarath> Rememberence gives boss item or souls
[6:13:29] <%Jackgar> Although the dragon arm also costs an extra 2000, but it's cool
[6:13:32] <%SpencerSDH> CHeck the stats.
[6:13:33] <Jetsfantasy> This is boss souls
[6:13:39] <%Jackgar> You can also get a dupe to get both weapons
[6:13:41] <%AncelDeLambert> @PeachSaliva you have to find a mausaleum
[6:13:46] <kittoimp> you can also clone remberances
[6:13:46] <$zyberion626> you find the roaming churches
[6:13:48] <%Dakuu75> So, there's a way to duplicate boss-souls. if you wanted to duel wield. you need to find the giant walking stone buildings
[6:13:51] <tanarath> You go to a special place & use it.
[6:13:52] <%Ranryu692> oooooh is that what the mausoleums do?
[6:13:59] <Mikers29> there is a place that you can use once to duplicate one remembrance
[6:14:01] <%Ranryu692> glad I've only used this one so far
[6:14:07] <%Jackgar> There's a walking mausoleum on the peninsula you might have already found
[6:14:11] <%Jackgar> You can do dupe it there
[6:14:23] <%Jackgar> And you can dupe one you already use, I believe
[6:14:24] <%CptCreampuff16> check out the weapons
[6:14:25] <%Dakuu75> if you really want.
[6:14:26] <%Jackgar> Yeah you can get both
[6:14:27] <scrumbotime> You can only make one of each though
[6:14:33] <scrumbotime> the shop has an "inventory"
[6:14:42] <kittoimp> its one of the loading screens. its a giant church on a walking mountain/turtle thing
[6:14:43] <+CalderGaming> you use up the mausoleum
[6:14:46] <tanarath> but you give up the chance to use it on later boss souls
[6:14:46] <%Ranryu692> you can press A safely
[6:14:46] <%CptCreampuff16> click ok
[6:14:47] <%Jackgar> Select the rememberance
[6:14:52] <%AncelDeLambert> click on it?
[6:14:54] <%Bloomingzonda> press a
[6:14:58] <%Jackgar> Just click on it
[6:14:59] <%Dakuu75> there's only so many of those duplicate spots. (I found like 4 so far and haven't explored everything.)
[6:15:03] <Kain5707> you have to give up your butt hole
[6:15:20] <%Bloomingzonda> Its gold and has furries on it, It is the paige weapon
[6:15:22] <%AncelDeLambert> so that earthquake thing he did
[6:15:37] <%Jackgar> Yeah it's considered used
[6:15:43] <%Dakuu75> they're one-use each
[6:15:47] <tanarath> Correct, 1 use per mausoleum
[6:16:00] <%Bloomingzonda> You also get a power up for going to the mausaleum after beating the assopciated boss
[6:16:03] <%AncelDeLambert> so hit x to check scaling
[6:16:03] <%Jackgar> It's L2 move is that volcano attack you saw him do
[6:16:17] <%Jackgar> Yes
[6:16:18] <tanarath> Don't use the soul tool you've thought about what you want to do with it.
[6:16:23] <+vaderxyz1970> The Tree was like okay that was cool well remember you for that
[6:16:23] <%Jackgar> Well no
[6:16:23] <%CptCreampuff16> yes
[6:16:24] <%AncelDeLambert> I mean, yeah, but it probably wouldn't be worth it
[6:16:28] <%Jackgar> You can only get 2 total
[6:16:31] <%AncelDeLambert> it probably costs runes to dupe
[6:16:35] <scrumbotime> you could get one of each
[6:16:35] <%CptCreampuff16> but its a limited amount of times you can do it
[6:16:38] <%Jackgar> It doesn't cost runes to dupe
[6:16:46] <%SpencerSDH> Just try it
[6:16:46] <+AlucardX60> You can turn your 1 soul into 2 soul then get both items.
[6:16:50] <+CalderGaming> it costs the mausoleum to dupe
[6:16:51] <%Jackgar> But when you dupe it, that mausoleum is used forever
[6:16:54] <%AncelDeLambert> it's been a long stream
[6:16:55] <%Dakuu75> I've never actually done it. so, Idk the cost of duplicating
[6:17:02] <%Jackgar> It's free but single use only
[6:17:04] <%imthewisejanitor> That was the sound of Pat beating a Gargoyle after like, two hours, holy shit
[6:17:10] <%Jackgar> There is also another guy you'll want to talk to here
[6:17:12] <tanarath> Don't use the boss soul now, think & ask people
[6:17:14] <%Ranryu692> talk to the incantation guy again before you leave, see what new incantations you can learn
[6:17:14] <%Bloomingzonda> Eat many borgers and have a good night
[6:17:16] <+dane332> rest well !
[6:17:16] <%AncelDeLambert> you dun good today
[6:17:17] <%Jackgar> But yeah, eat first
[6:17:18] <%Dakuu75> no rush
