[0:30:01] <@SoFarFetched> Check your computer and Streamlabs/OBS to make sure you didn't accidentally mute yourself
[0:30:09] <%FacetiousAF> hello chris wilson

[0:30:42] <+Sullen_Walrus> did something come unplugged?
[0:30:43] <@SoFarFetched> she's trying to fix that right now.
[0:30:44] <%FacetiousAF> psaGib wingies
[0:30:48] <@SoFarFetched> so give her time.
[0:30:59] <+Pleblu> she try restarting headphones maybe
[0:31:00] <%TheMoenia> we believe in you paige
[0:31:03] <%ospreyworks> Did it change your default input device?
[0:31:20] <DancesWitBalrog> i believe she said "FF6 is the greatest FF game of all time". sounds accurate
[0:31:21] <%featuringfen> double stream audio
[0:31:21] <formuoli8> wow
[0:31:22] <@SoFarFetched> @Pleblu headphones have nothing to do with the mic LUL

[0:31:27] <%CptCreampuff16> I think when she changed scene it didnt have a mic source
[0:31:31] <%ospreyworks> Nope, 2X stream audio
[0:31:34] <@MelBrooksKA> I think it happened as soon as you went away from Big Screen, not sure how that happened though
[0:31:43] <$trackles_64> we need paige subtitles
[0:31:47] <nomolomo> so weird how it happened after she switched windows tho
[0:31:49] <+Pleblu> @sofarfetched I'm thinking of mine
[0:31:51] <@SoFarFetched> Paige go through everything again to make sure nothing got accidentally muted.
[0:32:01] <love_machlne> paige are you sure the scene you switched to has a recording device rn?
[0:32:03] <$trackles_64> Do oyu know sign languege?
[0:32:07] <%BlackMage66652> Paige Will Figure It Out: Episode 01
[0:32:10] <twistedj3ster> did something get unplugged?
[0:32:17] <@SoFarFetched> Oh thats true,paige did the scene you switch too have an audio input?
[0:32:23] <@SoFarFetched> See if it lists your mic.
[0:32:23] <%ospreyworks> Nope
[0:32:27] <%Bailey__Gaming> Nurgle?
[0:32:29] <%ospreyworks> Double stream audio
[0:32:31] <nomolomo> @BlackMage66652 my favorite podcast!
[0:32:34] <Necnill> switch scenes and see if it randomly fixes maybe?
[0:32:39] <@SoFarFetched> If the mic isn't listed,it might mean you didn't add it as a source.
[0:32:41] <%ospreyworks> Okay, better
[0:32:49] <@SoFarFetched> try switching to just camera and see if your mic works.
[0:32:51] <~PeachSaliva> You can hear the game tho?
[0:32:55] <+Movemeister> Yus
[0:32:55] <+Sullen_Walrus> yes
[0:32:56] <%CptCreampuff16> yes
[0:32:57] <+polothegreatest> yup
[0:32:58] <+Pleblu> yup
[0:32:58] <%FacetiousAF> oh yeah game stream is fine
[0:32:58] <@SoFarFetched> Yeah we can still hear the video
[0:32:58] <blaflegume> I was like "wait, since when did Pat or Paige care about PoE?", then saw the hashtag LUL
[0:32:59] <%BlackMage66652> Yep
[0:32:59] <+Traximus_V> yes
[0:33:00] <bob900000> yes
[0:33:00] <%ospreyworks> Yup
[0:33:02] <%strakillias> Quick learn ASL and sign to us
[0:33:02] <Kyoshikei> Yes
[0:33:04] <Ell1ot> we can hear the game
[0:33:08] <@SoFarFetched> We'll let you know if the sound  goes out for that.
[0:33:18] <%FacetiousAF> @strakillias what's asl for "this shit looks hype"
[0:33:33] <love_machlne> once the trailer is over try switching back to the previous scene
[0:33:35] <%ospreyworks> No mic
[0:33:37] <%BlackMage66652> @strakillias Devil horns
[0:33:40] <+Sullen_Walrus> nope
[0:33:45] <@MelBrooksKA> no wah
[0:34:01] <Necnill> Maybe if we all pretend we hear we can gaslight the sponsors into thinking there's sound
[0:34:16] <%CptCreampuff16> Swap back to big screne
[0:34:17] <%ospreyworks> Maybe switch back to just chatting scene again?
[0:34:25] <+Ixiah> paige why would you turn off settings :(
[0:34:30] <@SoFarFetched> Paige are you able to do a screencap of what your setup looks like in OBS?
[0:34:35] <@SoFarFetched> just to be  sure
[0:34:51] <tanarath> Looking good, Paige!
[0:34:58] <mcarora19> First time I've ever seen a trailer actually use 'eldritch horror'
[0:35:04] <@SoFarFetched> cause its either you accidentally muted something,or the scene you're on currently doesn't have the mic.
[0:35:06] <@SoFarFetched> ORBB
[0:35:08] <%FacetiousAF> ... unplug the mic and put it back in??
[0:35:14] <%strakillias> @strakillias That or throwing thumbs up like the Fonz
[0:35:28] <~PeachSaliva> I know but nothing is working
[0:35:35] <~PeachSaliva> The game is more important than my voide
[0:35:39] <@SoFarFetched> THE VOID
[0:35:41] <~PeachSaliva> I’m sorry I’m doing my best. It worked beforehand
[0:35:41] <%BlackMage66652> Call Pat

[0:36:07] <Zeif00> can we introduce a whiteboard for communication
[0:36:10] <mcarora19> Just let the trailer play at this point, and fix it later
[0:36:10] <Necnill> It's all good, you're talking about as much as Pat
[0:36:14] <%ospreyworks> No wah

[0:43:57] <+krymzen5> ye, never got into Path bc its intimidating for me. theres so much stuff

[0:46:12] <DancesWitBalrog> she was too stunned to speak @sofarfetched
[0:46:13] <SlagChambers> @mcarora19 LUL
[0:46:19] <orpleborple> the woman was too stunned to speak
[0:46:23] <+sirjonston> paige in the lecture, puts glasses on and off in the hopes the knowledge will download
[0:47:05] <worldbrand> howdy paige lol
[0:47:06] <SlagChambers> Did she intentionally mute herself or did the mic mess up?
[0:47:08] <+AidanKuma> They did say that this stuff was post endgame. I don't think it's focused on new player stuff.
[0:47:14] <%FacetiousAF> 🤔 oh... kay
[0:47:15] <mcarora19> @slagchambers Mic mess up
[0:47:23] <SlagChambers> oof
[0:47:25] <DancesWitBalrog> her stand muted the mic YEP
[0:47:26] <missingangle> Still muted, oh no. Paige just sign your reactions :P
[0:47:27] <@SoFarFetched> There's a chance that either the mic is accidentally muted,or possibility the scene she might be on  doesn't have a mic?
[0:47:39] <@SoFarFetched> only way to test is if she quickly went to just camera and her voice was back.
[0:47:49] <@SoFarFetched> but she said it worked earlier.
[0:47:57] <worldbrand> I'm betting this is way more granular and detailed than you were expecting lol
[0:48:00] <DancesWitBalrog> paige speaks with her mind. i dont see what the problem is
[0:48:16] <+sirjonston> paige, no looking at your texts in class, pay attention to dry brittish boy
[0:48:53] <DancesWitBalrog> this is like taking your finals in a zoom meeting and your professor is watching you LUL
[0:49:00] <+SWFanatic> wottle bottle
[0:49:06] <+krymzen5> oh gooood that stuff
[0:49:22] <~PeachSaliva> @danceswitbalrog lol! Come on! This is actually super impressive for real
[0:50:09] <+krymzen5> seems like a minmaxers dream tbh
[0:50:15] <BackflipCharm> Ha ha he said sex
[0:50:22] <+AidanKuma> Heck yeah, this is like...Blood and Wine level addition to the game. just...rough for new players to sink their teeth into.
[0:50:33] <worldbrand> This is a lot of changes and improvements and additions, but it is also pretty much for players who have hit the endgame, and getting there is a feat in understanding the mechanics
[0:51:15] <%Sotetsu> Sex tents?
[0:51:16] <+AidanKuma> Truth, but it's also worth noting that getting to end game isn't too terrible of a commitment. it's not like you need to drop hundreds of dollars or anything.
[0:51:20] <+AidanKuma> just time.
[0:51:21] <~PeachSaliva> Lol sex
[0:51:43] <%Sotetsu> What is this game rated? sipsipGasm
[0:51:48] <%TheMoenia> i can literally only hear "sexed aunts"
[0:52:20] <+krymzen5> well someones gotta sex em
[0:52:25] <Ell1ot> i have no clue what the guy is talking about but i'm enjoying the pretty colors and explosions
[0:52:34] <XoftheTITANS> same
[0:52:40] <%FacetiousAF> nice nice nice nice
[0:53:00] <%TheMoenia> he could be speaking in greek for all i can understand, but pretty colours go brrrr
[0:53:58] <+cvp5127> should i be taking notes? will this be on the test?
[0:54:12] <+AidanKuma> PoE is like Warframe. It's confusing if you look at it's surface, but if you just inch your way in, stuff sort of reveals itself, and the community is good about helping with questions.
[0:54:22] <+satellyte_> warframe....
[0:54:26] <~PeachSaliva> @aidankuma for real
[0:54:27] <mcarora19> @aidankuma Depending on how much time, that's pretty much the same thing
[0:55:09] <+Kinoskae> @peachsaliva PPP Path of Exile Stream when?
[0:55:30] <+satellyte_> seeing the gears turning in peach's brain is great
[0:55:59] <Pookiedaexzile> Why is Pat Streaming this
[0:55:59] <+sirjonston> Paige thought she was playing diablo, instead shes playing COLLEGE
[0:56:14] <mcarora19> @pookiedaexzile They both got sponsored
[0:57:00] <+satellyte_> gonna try this out later
[0:57:04] <$NeoCre> I feel like we are 10 seconds from seeing smoke coming out of Paige’s ears
[0:57:13] <+AidanKuma> I love that they're giving you workarounds for RNG. RNG kills fun...This way we can always feel like our rewards are useful.
[0:57:30] <~PeachSaliva> @neocre lmao!!!
[0:58:15] <+sirjonston> @NeoCre the bose headphones are there to stop the smoke
[0:58:32] <+satellyte_> lol
[0:59:02] <mcarora19> @sirjonston But that's like blocking your exhaust
[0:59:08] <Mathochism> This game needs more sexy crypt keeper action.
[0:59:14] <Maya_Hett> relatively simple he said
[0:59:20] <XoftheTITANS> waiting for the, "This will be on the test."
[0:59:29] <%FacetiousAF> read them with your glasses paige

[1:00:11] <XoftheTITANS> DW?
[1:00:15] <+AidanKuma> Dual wield.
[1:00:24] <XoftheTITANS> thx
[1:00:26] <mcarora19> Man, even if I was into this game, there's no way I would be able to retain all this
[1:00:33] <+AidanKuma> HECK YES. sorting stash is hell!
[1:00:51] <blaflegume> hype
[1:00:55] <+satellyte_> thats neat
[1:01:04] <+AidanKuma> They don't want us to retain all of this, they want to let us know just how much there is we can find.
[1:01:09] <viciousgrim> so how much Do you understand page LUL
[1:01:15] <mcarora19> Fair enough
[1:01:20] <+satellyte_> oooo

[1:37:23] <%MarylandJutsu> oh god....dont remind me of about that post IT MADE ME CHOKE ON WATER
[1:37:33] <+93lobo> saw that on twitter
[1:37:41] <@SoFarFetched> make it your profile banner
[1:37:58] <%MarylandJutsu> @sofarfetched it does set the tone to any new followers
[1:37:59] <kobold_wrangler> She can’t be stopped
[1:38:07] <%cade_calrayn> my booster made my lymph nodes get GINORMOUS
[1:38:13] <+CalderGaming> that art is way more wholesome than I feared
[1:38:14] <Necnill> I got a reaction 8 days later. Ridiculous scenes -_-;
[1:38:16] <+Pleblu> I haven't gotten my booster yet...oy
[1:38:17] <%lord_of_iron_kingdom> but what about papyrus?
[1:38:27] <graemecrackers2> Take any weed during it?
[1:38:32] <twistedj3ster> yeah it takes a while and then kicks like a mule
[1:38:34] <%cade_calrayn> then my blasted boyfriend had his with no side effects because he NEVER gets sick
[1:38:37] <BattlexQueen> I got a wave exhaustion like 5 minutes after my booster 😂
[1:38:39] <%MarylandJutsu> is it bad if i.....didnt have any crazy symptoms from my booster? just a sore arm and tired
[1:38:46] <%MarylandJutsu> it makes me so nervous
[1:38:48] <SaltkeyAndAckfish> local swelling
[1:38:53] <@SoFarFetched> @MarylandJutsu its different for everyone.
[1:38:58] <Necnill> Oh yeah
[1:38:59] <$shurtal> yes
[1:39:00] <%lord_of_iron_kingdom> I took my booster and my flu shot at the same time and man. worse mistake
[1:39:04] <mcarora19> Knots in muscles
[1:39:05] <luftraumm1> the meat swellling
[1:39:05] <+Pleblu> no I understand that
[1:39:06] <$NitronStreams> kinda
[1:39:09] <SaltkeyAndAckfish> but it was pretty fine, did 20km nordic ski the day after
[1:39:10] <+SenorCounter> muscles aches
[1:39:11] <thetruthofyourbeing> when you can feel your clothes on you it's horrible
[1:39:12] <%MisterRockett> Breasts?
[1:39:13] <%MarylandJutsu> thank you Far, my anxiety brain appreciates it
[1:39:15] <%skrewarrior> your muscles?
[1:39:17] <+SenorCounter> and sometimes bone aches
[1:39:17] <+Prism_Zet> second one fucked me up pretty good, hoping the third goes better
[1:39:25] <%MarylandJutsu> So were your bones made of glass?
[1:39:29] <luftraumm1> inflamatory response maybe?
[1:39:31] <%Spadoinkle> Sorry, but worth.
[1:39:49] <%MarylandJutsu> for context new viewers: unusually messed up for paige is SOMETHING else
[1:39:57] <%cade_calrayn> this is the Mustard Lupus Queen, she's used to this sort of thing
[1:40:00] <%BlackSunEmperor> Paige passed the trial of fire
[1:40:07] <mcarora19> I got 101 fever with the first shot,  but rest were fine
[1:40:22] <%Spadoinkle> Yeah, kind of.
[1:40:23] <%ospreyworks> Imagine not being able to breathe on top of that
[1:40:24] <graemecrackers2> :(
[1:40:40] <SchroedingersFerret> Is it because your immune system is overreactive?
[1:40:43] <mcarora19> Lupus with Covid-19 would be legit horrific
[1:40:43] <%cade_calrayn> every time I hear the word Ponder I think of pondering the orb
[1:40:47] <+Volkrotia> I actually got COVID in December, double vaxxed, if i wasn't vaxxed i'd wish i was dead
[1:40:49] <graemecrackers2> Good job body
[1:40:50] <+Pleblu> I always get the worst of any sickness I get around. it blows
[1:40:50] <%MarylandJutsu> A mood paige, got those mutations that doctors have been like....if you get it? could be worse than the average person.....THANKS DNA
[1:40:55] <%OctaivianRex> You basically got thrashed on easy mode.
[1:40:58] <Reanimator83> I got my 2 shot and got covid. All I got was a head cold, luckily
[1:41:01] <mcarora19> Yep
[1:41:06] <%BinaryFireball> i got crazy shivers
[1:41:08] <luftraumm1> iirc lupus has a correlation with extreme inflamatory responses, so that seems like a good guess at your reaction to actual covid
[1:41:09] <%BinaryFireball> it sucked
[1:41:09] <graemecrackers2> The mustard killed it
[1:41:17] <%ospreyworks> My mom caught covid at the beginning of the pandemic and that fever wrecked her. She became dehydrated and started hallucinating.
[1:41:19] <%MarylandJutsu> oh wow even I got a sore arm and was more anemic then usual
[1:41:21] <mcarora19> My sister with fibromyalgia has similar issues
[1:41:24] <+Titsmcgheeee> I thought I had covid again with my vaccine but I caught covid twice prior
[1:41:30] <%MarylandJutsu> Coming this fall.....Moderna Moderna
[1:41:31] <+oktavia_von> my arm was just sore
[1:41:31] <+ominous_crows> it knocked me out for a week
[1:41:33] <%barrakuta371> My mom got only the sore arm. my sister and I were basically bed ridden for a few days.
[1:41:44] <%Spadoinkle> Get the cocktail.
[1:41:45] <+cvp5127> its good to mix?
[1:41:48] <graemecrackers2> All mine were moderna
[1:41:54] <%MarylandJutsu> Pfizer: i'm about to ruin this lady's day
[1:41:54] <+CalderGaming> where i am in california they advised NOT to mix
[1:41:55] <%TheMoenia> my first astra shot fucking slayed me. the second astra and the pfizer booster i only had slight swelling in my arm
[1:42:03] <+RandyFistburgers> @cvp5127 It can give you more robust protection
[1:42:15] <marvel877> They said you CAN mix, but eh...
[1:42:17] <+Volkrotia> They are technically made in the same lab jsut by diff companies
[1:42:19] <%Spadoinkle> I don't think anyones one hundred percent sure yet. Too early.
[1:42:19] <mcarora19> Doesn't make much difference
[1:42:20] <BattlexQueen> I went Pfizer Moderna Pfizer and the Moderna reaction was definitely the worst
[1:42:22] <$NeoCre> I missed, did you get Moderna?
[1:42:28] <%skrewarrior> I'm rocking straight pfizer
[1:42:29] <%MarylandJutsu> I'm doing research for financial stuff: there's not enough data to FULLY support it but many doctors believe mixing can assist with better reslienc
[1:42:31] <%MarylandJutsu> reslience
[1:42:57] <%cade_calrayn> "oh good morning! *kicks you in the gut*"
[1:43:00] <%Spadoinkle> Gotta up that resistance stat.
[1:43:02] <+RandyFistburgers> It means your body is looking out for two sections of the covid RNA  rather than one. So youre more protected from mutations if you mix
[1:43:09] <%MarylandJutsu> but its a crapshoot cause its a global pandemic and different locations can potentially cause the virus to work in different ways
[1:43:17] <thebalticguy1> Yeah i got covid yesterday so its nota funtime
[1:43:17] <luftraumm1> @PeachSaliva sorry about derailing this conversation, but i have to recommend a video to you, i instantly thought about your kind of humour and wanted to hear your thoughts, have you seen the lizard instagram girl video going around on twitter?
[1:43:18] <mcarora19> Literally what doesn't kill you makes you stronger
[1:43:23] <%MarylandJutsu> a tangent? in my paige stream? NEVER
[1:43:26] <StoicMoogle> Hey Peach :3
[1:43:31] <%Jamejarrs> Do you feel Breaky?
[1:43:35] <$NeoCre> So far it’s sounding like Moderna>Astra>Pfizer in order of strong to weak side effects and level of protection
[1:43:37] <%MarylandJutsu> how do you feel? I feeeeellll youuuuu joahhhhaannnnnaaa
[1:43:46] <marvel877> My mom and my cousin's teenagers got the Pfizer, felt nothing. My dad, cousin, and myself got the Moderna, kicked our asses.
[1:44:02] <luftraumm1> its hilarious gonna send it immediatelly
[1:44:06] <%MarylandJutsu> also remember paige has teh memory of a goldfish
[1:44:10] <%MarylandJutsu> so she might have seen it
[1:44:17] <%Bailey__Gaming> Glad you are feelin better
[1:44:20] <thebalticguy1> i was fine with pfizer
[1:44:21] <churropoppa> Moderna Gang nesuaFlex
[1:44:23] <tentavision> i got pfizer and frlt nothing
[1:44:27] <+satellyte_> peoples bodies are different
[1:44:29] <%MarylandJutsu> if you don't trust anything else, trust Dolly
[1:44:33] <+RandyFistburgers> Moderna has 3x the dose, thats why it kicks your ass
[1:44:44] <%TheMoenia> astra gang rise up
[1:44:52] <%MarylandJutsu> @RandyFistburgers well the booster acutally is a half dose of the standard/first two
[1:45:02] <%MarylandJutsu> for Moderna i mean
[1:45:03] <%KeiganOfAstora> He is taking care of himself first LUL
[1:45:03] <+Prism_Zet> LOL did you get the eye test updated yet?
[1:45:05] <%cade_calrayn> if you smashed your glasses on stream, you'd never live it down, Paige
[1:45:15] <mcarora19> @prism_zet she got new glasses
[1:45:18] <+RandyFistburgers> @MarylandJutsu But the moderna booster will still have 3x the pfizer
[1:45:18] <%MarylandJutsu> @cade_calrayn implying she hasn't done that already
[1:45:23] <yousomuch_> that pitcher was so cute!
[1:45:24] <+Prism_Zet> @mcarora19 oh thank god
[1:45:31] <rindoesstuffnthings> I'm part of the study for AstraZeneca. my immune system is overactive and I had one of 2 of the worst responses at that center

[1:52:39] <ammobasket> Every kitchen can be made a bit better
[1:52:43] <$chance_h> This is the weirdest Jerma impression, but really spot on
[1:52:45] <%MarylandJutsu> You'll just bang out that Kitchen remodeling over the summer
[1:52:53] <%ospreyworks> Man, hearing what so many people had planned for the spring of 2020 in the last two years is just really sad.

[1:53:47] <%Sotetsu> I just want to make sure I have all the ingredients the day before
[1:53:48] <+Dives__> I hate measuring so baking doesn't work for me. Eyeball everything!
[1:53:56] <%MarylandJutsu> tiny lebanese dad who looks amazing for his age
[1:53:58] <+RandyFistburgers> Hence the mustard chugging?

[1:54:23] <tentavision> you can fix him

[1:54:31] <+terraspan> Mustard is the ultimate spice. Makes sense.
[1:54:38] <%Bailey__Gaming> My Brain makes me HATE spicey food
[1:54:38] <+alternative_flu> Your dad is Lebanese? That's pretty cool
[1:54:39] <%ospreyworks> What are your top 3 particular ingredients that you always need to have on hand that might not be super popular?
[1:54:41] <%barrakuta371> Did your dad also tell you to drink mustard? sipsipHellmo

[1:57:18] <%Sotetsu> How do you spell that?
[1:57:22] <%MarylandJutsu> @cade_calrayn RACOON PAIGE
[1:57:25] <+FingaLights> AKA Dumpster diving
[1:57:57] <%MarylandJutsu> Fig doesn't sound like a pleasant color...its like puce
[1:58:01] <formuoli8> looks orange to me
[1:58:06] <BattlexQueen> oh that is a gorgeous colour
[1:58:08] <%Jamejarrs> Le Creuset for those who missed the spelling
[1:58:12] <%Jamejarrs> It pretty
[1:58:13] <+capnshupe> @PeachSaliva they're selling new fig dutch ovens on Crate&Barrel
[1:58:14] <%Sotetsu> Wow, gorgeous but expensive.
[1:58:24] <@SoFarFetched> I recently got a dutch oven geefPeep
[1:58:26] <%MarylandJutsu> Paige wants purple cause she she wants to feel like royalty
[1:58:28] <xXVeggiePLusXx> Put it on screen?
[1:58:33] <+capnshupe> aaaaaaaah v v fair, this is state-side
[1:58:35] <Eldalu> we still have it
[1:58:35] <+RandyFistburgers> crate and barrel is in canada
[1:58:42] <%MarylandJutsu> yeah what is up with Quebec in particular with shipping/buying stuff?
[1:58:43] <+SenorCounter> oof 390 on ebay
[1:58:43] <%king_wragles> Glad to hear everyone catching up with Dutch ovens
[1:58:43] <+Grayhammatter> oh, that's a rather nice purple
[1:58:44] <%FacetiousAF> kweebeck
[1:58:47] <+Pleblu> Oh I love that color
[1:58:47] <+RandyFistburgers> ah
[1:58:49] <+zamatermort> Ship it to your parents?
[1:58:51] <%king_wragles> It's the perfect tool for short ribs
[1:58:57] <%Sotetsu> What is a dutch oven? I'm only familiar with the slang.
[1:59:00] <tanarath> Canaidia is weird with shipping.
[1:59:01] <+Pleblu> That color with the gold yaaaass
[1:59:02] <BattlexQueen> could you ship it to family or a friend and have them send it to you?
[1:59:05] <%TheMoenia> yeah, and god is right about it too
[1:59:12] <luftraumm1> no techical shenanigans
[1:59:16] <%Dakuu75> I thought a dutch oven was when someone farts under the bed sheets
[1:59:26] <%MarylandJutsu> if you got gold? you have paige's attention
[1:59:27] <rindoesstuffnthings> yikes 109$
[1:59:27] <+CalderGaming> @Sotetsu heavy casserole pot, usually cast iron, if that means something to you
[1:59:29] <+goblinking92> is 500 alot for this?
[1:59:30] <Dopopo> Nah Quebec hates everyone
[1:59:37] <oda_flobunaga> Dutch oven is a thick sided ceramic pot
[1:59:46] <luftraumm1> 500 is a lot of anything
[1:59:53] <+Grayhammatter> i could buy a ps5 with that
[1:59:56] <+CalderGaming> le creuset's are ceramic-coated cast iron
[2:00:00] <+goblinking92> but is it worth it?
[2:00:01] <%MarylandJutsu> Do you think you were a noble/royalty in a past life? that would explain the love of gold and purple
[2:00:02] <+RandyFistburgers> Cuz french
[2:00:05] <Ombrebird> paige u know someone's gonna send you the ozzie fig now right?
[2:00:15] <luftraumm1> they last multiple lives
[2:00:16] <+CalderGaming> @goblinking92 it can last multiple lifetimes
[2:00:34] <graemecrackers2> Design Tascano has cool skeleton decor
[2:00:38] <+Pleblu> Ive never heard of these before but Im now in love
[2:00:50] <+Pleblu> Meringue is also pretty
[2:00:51] <%MarylandJutsu> you give it to your next of kin
[2:00:51] <+goblinking92> @caldergaming wow!
[2:00:55] <%Sotetsu> I'm going to die alone, so I guess it's not worth it
[2:01:02] <+ConLin_Arts_> so it is quality and not just "branding" that makes price big?
[2:01:03] <+Pleblu> Pass it down to elmo
[2:01:04] <%TheMoenia> pass it down to elmo and gief
[2:01:08] <Eldalu> the au store has a bunch of things in fig
[2:01:12] <%king_wragles> Lodge and Crock Pot also have Dutch ovens. Both have them under 100 USD$
[2:01:15] <+Grayhammatter> pass it down to gief
[2:01:17] <%MarylandJutsu> Here Gief, this oven will one day be yours. Gief: *stares at wall*
[2:01:23] <luftraumm1> the dutch oven is also an infallible cheat for baking soudough
[2:01:28] <+RandyFistburgers> Superstore actually does a good enamelled cast iron if one can't come up with le creuset dough
[2:01:30] <+ConLin_Arts_> when will they sponsor you
[2:01:36] <tanarath> Dumpster diving does!
[2:01:38] <%king_wragles> I like my Lodge dutch oven a good bit

[2:07:21] <%ospreyworks> How is that Herman Miller? I really want to get one
[2:07:30] <+ThomasOfTroy> HBO showed someone dying on a peloton, which tanked the stock. Peloton then made an ad with the actor who 'died', which was fixing the stock before that actor was accused of sexual misconduct.

[2:17:39] <%Sotetsu> @prism_zet LUL
[2:17:39] <%JoshManVGH> I imagine the Odo dog would need to be something with the temperament of a Doberman. something very serious and hyper aware.
[2:17:45] <DusK_The_Stray> So stylish
[2:18:23] <graemecrackers2> I want a pet chameleon
[2:18:27] <Maids4lyfe> until it mutates and does!
[2:18:32] <Kangumosa> Dogs can only give love and affection to humans.
[2:18:50] <%FaultyJawa> Bulldogs are very stoic, mine is too

[2:18:55] <%JoshManVGH> Aww!

[2:20:19] <+Pleblu> We babysat inlaws bulldog and we would wake up to her on the bed staring at us sleeping. Creepy shit
[2:20:30] <@MelBrooksKA> There's something about "no, it's just his face" that's hilarious
[2:20:38] <Maids4lyfe> LUL
[2:20:38] <%captain_thickthighs> Maybe its the saggyness Geif can relate

[2:21:35] <@SoFarFetched> door just breaks open
[2:21:36] <+Prism_Zet> My uncles bulldog would bark and run around when we were in the pool but never swim, I think he thought we were drowning. Then he dove in and tried to get to us, and just sank like a rock, had to lift him back out.
[2:21:43] <%FacetiousAF> like balls?
[2:21:48] <+Heart0fInk> Anal vore? Hot..
[2:21:50] <+BakiinPlaysStuff> Growing up my dog had a docked tail. When he would get really excited not only would his nub of a tail start wagging but his whole ass would be shaking. Could not contain the excitement LUL
[2:21:52] <+PrimalDweeb> Did they sleep there too?
[2:21:53] <%JoshManVGH> woolieONEGUY
[2:22:23] <@SoFarFetched> I also feel people didn't have a lot of confidence in you guys,even though you guys have mentioned MANY times you made sure to do research and everything.
[2:22:26] <%ChrisPlaysThing> Did you hear how vtubers don't want to be called eGirls now? They want to be called iLadies
[2:22:32] <luftraumm1> the possibility for getting bred dogs from shelters is a great way to escape the whole breeding environment
[2:22:35] <%FacetiousAF> the person un-incesting them?
[2:22:45] <+Pleblu> Thats so good. AKC bulldogs are a damn mess poor things
[2:23:14] <luftraumm1> but thats a systemic issue that needs to be adressed as such
[2:23:19] <+MetalPanic> it's less about un-inscesting them and more that they were bred for looks over health for so long
[2:23:24] <%Broand> His burgers
[2:23:25] <+Nekros4442> @chrisplaysthing ....why cant we just call them vtubers

[2:25:53] <+FingaLights> Paige is afraid of showing Skelly smut
[2:25:55] <$shurtal> the purple polka dot suit?
[2:25:57] <%Sotetsu> Converse can be sexy
[2:25:59] <mcarora19> Paige =/= Tucker Carlson?
[2:26:01] <+goblinking92> blue!?
[2:26:02] <%captain_thickthighs> converse give you extra grip
[2:26:02] <%FacetiousAF> who picked those colors...
[2:26:04] <+Prism_Zet> tucker carlson isn't turned on by the m&m anymore and he's sad
[2:26:04] <+Echlir> Her previous pant suit looked way better
[2:26:06] <+Logoth_> She looks like Hillary Clinton
[2:26:10] <SomersaultJustice> oof it's awful
[2:26:12] <Valkryna> I saw it and it doesn't look good
[2:26:12] <marvel877> That dumb pantsuit that's totally just for an anniversary thing and she'll go back to her OG design afterwards, but Fox News had a slow news day and decided to bitch about it?
[2:26:16] <+Pleblu> Yeah that is an ugly pantsuit
[2:26:16] <tentavision> it looks good+it doesn't matter
[2:26:16] <%JoshManVGH> Polkadots and stripes seems super busy
[2:26:17] <$shurtal> it's.... there's something about the patern that looks off
[2:26:18] <Maids4lyfe> why
[2:26:20] <nibble_nuts> this minnie is terrible
[2:26:21] <luftraumm1> Stella MCCartney though
[2:26:24] <mcarora19> It was just astroturfing to distract from child slavery anyway
[2:26:25] <+Heart0fInk> *** This thing?
[2:26:26] <%ospreyworks> It looks stupid and overly complicated
[2:26:27] <+polothegreatest> LUL LUL LUL
[2:26:28] <+Hellarussian> as you do
[2:26:31] <+Grayhammatter> shid and fard
[2:26:32] <%JoshManVGH> Bow pockets are also odd
[2:26:50] <%BinaryFireball> i love that Dinklage called out disney recently
[2:26:51] <luftraumm1> the blue doesnt work too
[2:26:53] <+RandyFistburgers> It even would have been better if it at least kept her colours imo
[2:27:00] <Maids4lyfe> I cannot imagine her without the polka dot dress
[2:27:05] <$shurtal> there's no color variation so it's hard to tell  wherer the top ends and the pants begin
[2:27:11] <%captain_thickthighs> she does look like shes gonna speak at the dnc
[2:27:12] <+Pleblu> Im for her wearing pants thats fine but this is a little ugh
[2:27:13] <+Heart0fInk> I miss when she was topless..
[2:27:29] <+polothegreatest> aLuli
[2:27:30] <%JoshManVGH> Is Mickey Mouse still shirtless? Why they hell can't he class up a bit, his girl is trying.
[2:27:30] <+alternative_flu> I don't understand why change the color
[2:27:30] <DancesWitBalrog> yeahhhh that outfit isnt fgashionable at all
[2:27:31] <marvel877> its totally not a permanent thing but yeah, it looks dumb.
[2:27:32] <luftraumm1> pantsuits with cleavage though Kreygasm Kreygasm
[2:27:32] <%TheMoenia> donald i think of blue, daisy is just freestyle
[2:27:33] <+polothegreatest> LUL LUL LUL
[2:27:42] <smoothwood07> it is certainly, a choice
[2:27:49] <%captain_thickthighs> they'll probably change it back after a the merch is sold out
[2:27:51] <+Heart0fInk> light blue daisy
[2:27:52] <%ospreyworks> Purple?
[2:28:05] <+PrimalDweeb> The mice are red, the ducks are blue.

[2:28:12] <rindoesstuffnthings> it's a suit
[2:28:12] <+PrimalDweeb> I think.
[2:28:13] <+Hellarussian> what a bold stance to take on this matter
[2:28:13] <%TheMoenia> donald duck comic books in particular are VERY big in parts of europe
[2:28:22] <+alternative_flu> shout out to that time my friend showed up to a court case wearing a polkadot suit and getting chewed out by the judge over it
[2:28:27] <+cvp5127> make her wear the suit in kingdom hearts
[2:28:27] <%JoshManVGH> is it intentionally supposed to a be "Disney Girl Boss" style?
[2:28:32] <+RandyFistburgers> Disney trying to be woke in any way just seems disingenuous cuz they're just too evil
[2:28:33] <SchroedingersFerret> Minnie has to go back to work because of the economy.
[2:28:34] <DancesWitBalrog> i never seen a dot suit on a non-clown ever
[2:28:39] <%ospreyworks> It almost makes me wonder if Disney's trying to distract from a scandal somewhere
[2:28:45] <graemecrackers2> Maybe we will find out why soon
[2:28:50] <+alternative_flu> true
[2:28:51] <%captain_thickthighs> You know what "slams table" lets give minnie hooker boots, Sluts rise up 2022
[2:29:00] <luftraumm1> good tailoring is always great
[2:29:06] <%TheMoenia> maybe disney plans to buy nestle
[2:29:08] <+Heart0fInk> Like.. women can look really good in a suit. Fuckin Mini mouse looks awful in one.

[3:00:06] <+Prism_Zet> Are you going to get one of those japanese, old people mech frames, then you could carry pat up the stairs
[3:00:09] <graemecrackers2> Peggy and Al Bundy
[3:00:20] <%MarylandJutsu> its great that when it counts you really do love each other, sometimes that just embodies itself by yelling at each other
[3:00:20] <@CreepyPorpoise> baking for animals is a good place to start, simple and they'll love it no matter what
[3:00:21] <Nancys_Perm> they're not difficult at all
[3:00:26] <%ChrisPlaysThing> I make jerky treats for my dog, she loves them
[3:00:31] <%cade_calrayn> oh god *that* is a slippery slope, Paige, and it ends with that dog never leaving you alone more than now
[3:00:35] <mcarora19> He's got his priorities straight
[3:00:40] <+Prism_Zet> @CreepyPorpoise cats, sometimes picky, gief would probably eat anything
[3:00:41] <Reanimator83> And his hair

[3:01:26] <ExpressNode> The house is a clown car
[3:01:31] <@MelBrooksKA> Ain't no rest for the peched
[3:01:33] <%MarylandJutsu> There is no god, only elmo
[3:01:43] <StoicMoogle> Its a blursed house
[3:01:47] <tanarath> Paige, don't you want more cursed animals, though?
[3:02:06] <stevenellis386> the dog, the cat, and the holy pat
[3:02:07] <+Prism_Zet> this is all training for the little people
[3:02:20] <%ChrisPlaysThing> 2020 was a... special year
[3:02:27] <%QueequegTheater> I live in Missouri, hearing this is kind of hilarious, because my small town has been totally normal since like summer 2020
[3:02:32] <graemecrackers2> Next location for the gathering of the juggalos
[3:02:39] <luftraumm1> become the dongus

[3:03:56] <%ospreyworks> Been doing photography color correction for work. Lots of photos of cigars. The just chatting has been funny.
[3:04:05] <+MooseIsGoose> Carmax normally helps a lot
[3:04:06] <luftraumm1> is it cold over there??
[3:04:07] <+Prism_Zet> Oh yeah, the other series I worked on came out on netflix
[3:04:09] <thetruthofyourbeing> helping me unwind after a tough day working at the hospital thanks Paige.
[3:04:12] <%MarylandJutsu> Same here paige
[3:04:20] <+SaphronBlackbourne> One of my favorite parts of you and Pat's streams is when you just sit and talk so this is great
[3:04:23] <%ChrisPlaysThing> I have a small one for my room, also is an essential oil diffuser
[3:04:25] <+PrimalDweeb> I'd say drink more water, but...
[3:04:37] <@CreepyPorpoise> I'm assuming you've been dealing with the same weather we have, its so SO cold and dry creepy49Cry
[3:04:38] <Onyx_Oryx> vanicream is where it's at. had terrible eczema on my lips and it cured it!
[3:04:38] <%ChrisPlaysThing> so i have lavender and all kinds of smells going on
[3:04:42] <Maids4lyfe> my grandma would use mayo
[3:04:58] <+Mekhet09> How the hell do you drink that much per day?
[3:05:04] <ExpressNode> Oh yeah imaging delivering all day and having your fingers burn from the cold.
[3:05:06] <+electric_bees> honestly, some of my favorite parts of your streams is just listening to you and pat bicker around and talk to chat
[3:05:11] <Zeif00> I LOVE sugar scrubs
[3:05:12] <Zakaraz> dry winters and eczema were a big problem before getting a humidifier. humidity went from 20% to 60%
[3:05:25] <+Breaknoon> oh yeah
[3:05:28] <Maids4lyfe> you're supposed to drink a lot of water over the course of a day @Mekhet09
[3:05:33] <thetruthofyourbeing> sip don't swig
[3:05:36] <%FacetiousAF> PAIGE
[3:05:38] <%FacetiousAF> goddamn it
[3:05:43] <+PrimalDweeb> Me too, Burts Bees is great.
[3:05:44] <Maids4lyfe> damnit paige

[3:05:54] <ItsMisterJason> Me. LUL
[3:05:56] <%captain_thickthighs> how? its literall life juice
[3:06:02] <+SenorCounter> It takes like nothing, literally nothing.
[3:06:03] <%ChrisPlaysThing> I can't say I enjoy water
[3:06:04] <Maids4lyfe> because it isn't salty enough?
[3:06:06] <+SenorCounter> tastes*
[3:06:07] <Nancys_Perm> a lot of people hate water, I love it
[3:06:08] <%ShinBojangles> I hated water as a kid and would drink nothing but sports drinks
[3:06:11] <ArOne_Start> hating what keeps you alive
[3:06:12] <%ospreyworks> Same. Can't drink it first thing in the morning. It has to be coffee.
[3:06:12] <+Taglog7> how do you feel about water pokemon?
[3:06:13] <%ChrisPlaysThing> I drink it because I must, or die
[3:06:13] <%bravebravesrobin> @peachsaliva drink Bud Light
[3:06:14] <mcarora19> Its the most neutral tasteless thing in the world
[3:06:14] <thetruthofyourbeing> 100% of water drinkers die.
[3:06:15] <ItsMisterJason> I drink coffee and milk all the time.
[3:06:16] <batspiderfish> used to hate water, until Elmo came along
[3:06:16] <%ShinBojangles> Now I almost only drink water
[3:06:19] <ItsMisterJason> That's like it
[3:06:22] <%Kirby_Sauce> @mcarora19 The aliens from that one movie
[3:06:27] <%ospreyworks> I got a yeti rambler, though, and i try to do three of those a day
[3:06:32] <%Kirby_Sauce> Signs i think?
[3:06:35] <@SoFarFetched> didnt you drink a lot of coconut water geefBlank
[3:06:36] <mcarora19> @bravebravesrobin Become the Ben Kissel
[3:06:42] <%FacetiousAF> get some gamersupps Kappa
[3:06:42] <%captain_thickthighs> is this why some Americans drink coke all the time
[3:06:49] <%CptCreampuff16> no glass you might want to eat it
[3:06:49] <+Prism_Zet> ugh, infusers gross me out
[3:06:53] <%bravebravesrobin> @mcarora19 it is known
[3:06:55] <+DamnFineCupofStreaming> hates water, eats poison
[3:06:58] <%ChrisPlaysThing> Drink a Coors light, it's like having sex on a canoe. It's fucking close to water
[3:07:03] <%BogBodyPositive> I also hate water so I've gotten REALLY into brewing cold tea
[3:07:09] <Maids4lyfe> did you forget to paint the nails on your other hand?
[3:07:10] <thetruthofyourbeing> gwt some sliced cucumbers in there Kreygasm
[3:07:13] <+PrimalDweeb> I'd love something big like that, of it kept the water cold.
[3:07:18] <%ChrisPlaysThing> huehuehue
[3:07:18] <mcarora19> @kirby_sauce Paige does sound like a Shyamalan character sometimes
[3:07:40] <+Mekhet09> I have to drink bottled water and most of it sucks but the water here is good for showering not good for putting into your body.
[3:07:40] <segychan> peach is here
[3:07:40] <graemecrackers2> Poggers
[3:07:43] <%CptCreampuff16> ngl ice cold water be hittin diff
[3:07:43] <captain_elsewhere> yeah i allways change plastic water bottles like every 6 months, probably should be more regular
[3:07:44] <+WeLucklessJacks> Water is great.
[3:07:47] <Maids4lyfe> the twist is how she continues to survive @mcarora19
[3:07:50] <ItsMisterJason> I would piss like 4 hours of the day
[3:07:59] <+Grayhammatter> LUL
[3:08:02] <Nancys_Perm> that's cool encouragement
[3:08:02] <DeathByPoke7> I would pee too much
[3:08:06] <%bravebravesrobin> @peachsaliva drinking from plastic is fine, as long as you clean it every few days or so, but it definitely shouldn't be permanent
[3:08:09] <+Prism_Zet> @ItsMisterJason you do basically fi you drink the whole thing
[3:08:11] <%ospreyworks> Drinking more water has helped massively with me getting headaches from being dehydrated
[3:08:12] <+Grayhammatter> drink the whole thing and then pee for 5 hours
[3:08:13] <%ShinBojangles> Its a game where piss is the prize PogBones
[3:08:15] <thetruthofyourbeing> gamification hydration
[3:08:17] <%bravebravesrobin> @peachsaliva that's hot
[3:08:18] <%strakillias> Are you able to lift that when it is full with your back?
[3:08:21] <%ChrisPlaysThing> you are pretty close to the limit
[3:08:21] <Profmcstevie> Hydration doesn't work by dumping it all at once LUL
[3:08:22] <tanarath> Shoe Pat how hard you can piss
[3:08:23] <+Grayhammatter> getting waterlogged is not good
[3:08:29] <Maids4lyfe> I have diabetes and I piss from nothing
[3:08:30] <mcarora19> Water toxicity is real but unlikely
[3:08:34] <Nancys_Perm> it's dangerous to drink a lot of water at once
[3:08:39] <+PrimalDweeb> You can literally drown your liver
[3:08:42] <captain_elsewhere> imagin46LUL
[3:08:46] <%captain_thickthighs> cant stack hydration buffs
[3:08:49] <+SaphronBlackbourne> A lady died by drinking too much water for a Wii
[3:08:57] <tanarath> Also, it can thin out the minerals in your blood, which can make thinking harder.
[3:08:59] <%bravebravesrobin> @peachsaliva get an IV
[3:08:59] <%ChrisPlaysThing> it's like 2.5 liters in less than 1 hour=death
[3:09:01] <+capnshupe> @Maids4lyfe twinsies
[3:09:08] <%lord_of_iron_kingdom> I do actually!
[3:09:10] <Maids4lyfe> nope
[3:09:11] <ItsMisterJason> Then like, i would never know if i was pissing from a fucked up prostate or just being a water drinking king. LUL
[3:09:14] <%lord_of_iron_kingdom> I love my sensor
[3:09:18] <%captain_thickthighs> are you a cyborg
[3:09:19] <segychan> wow that ring is HUGE
[3:09:27] <%cade_calrayn> Pat could never handle having an IV in the house
[3:09:39] <%lord_of_iron_kingdom> I am a cyborg
[3:09:41] <mcarora19> I habe to constantly drink water or I get burning dripping piss. Same as my pops.
[3:09:43] <%bravebravesrobin> 😳😳😳😳
[3:09:44] <Profmcstevie> Wired her up to a bottle of evian
[3:09:54] <%ChrisPlaysThing> Oh man, i don't know how i'll ever handle having an IV
[3:09:55] <%cade_calrayn> Pat hates needles too much
[3:10:03] <+PrimalDweeb> Did you enjoy the hard poops afterwards?
[3:10:03] <%ChrisPlaysThing> I really don't like needles
[3:10:09] <thetruthofyourbeing> insane hydration
[3:10:10] <%ospreyworks> I donated blood 3 times in 2020 after being exposed to covid to keep checking if I had antibodies. Donating blood made me realize how little water I drank regularly.
[3:10:14] <renyrells> got an iv once, i was pissing like a race horse the rest of the day
[3:10:15] <+SaphronBlackbourne> I think I might not have been drinking enough because awhile back I got a kidney stone, worst pain I ever felt
[3:10:17] <+Grayhammatter> insane hydration
[3:10:22] <+VentWilsn> IVs make you look radiant CONFIRMED
[3:10:30] <%bravebravesrobin> @peachsaliva what happened; I almost died?
[3:10:32] <%tentavision> you don't look like you're dying anymore!
[3:10:38] <@CreepyPorpoise> water is so important for your skin, its pretty nuts
[3:10:52] <$chance_h> if i don't work out my body doesn't give me the hydration cravings until i get a headache
[3:10:56] <Profmcstevie> Hook me up to that GOOD LOOKING JUICE doc
[3:11:01] <marvel877> Drink the water, Paige. PUT IT IN MY MOUTH.
[3:11:02] <@CreepyPorpoise> You don't even realize it until you're actually hydrated
[3:11:07] <%king_wragles> Grapes, celery, and a glass of plain water a day folks
[3:11:14] <segychan> @PeachSaliva will you show off your rings
[3:11:16] <%bravebravesrobin> @peachsaliva drinking water is great for sun burns too
[3:11:18] <DancesWitBalrog> my skin is so dry rn kuz of the cold weather and it's bothering me. i'm chugging water
[3:11:24] <+Prism_Zet> coins in your wrinkles is good for the magic tricks with the kids tho
[3:11:26] <+VentWilsn> weird you never hear about people taking IVs to look better outside of the hospital
[3:11:27] <%captain_thickthighs> WATER YOU NEED TO LIVE SKIN KEEPS YOU JUICE IN
[3:11:38] <mcarora19> Paige wants to fuck the cryptkeeper, not become one
[3:11:44] <%lord_of_iron_kingdom> as a diabetic the amount of water you need to drink to help your body regulate your stuff is nuts man
[3:11:48] <%FacetiousAF> comfy stream
[3:11:57] <Nancys_Perm> look at the bright side, you can do victor Victoria on your own
[3:11:58] <%lord_of_iron_kingdom> being type 1 or type 2 diabetic sucks
[3:12:06] <Sunstalker> A braaaap ring?

[3:12:44] <@SoFarFetched> do you ask Pat "Which hand do you want, Sans or Papyrus?"

[3:15:53] <+terry_quest> you have so many rings lol

[3:16:09] <DianaTheAscian> @peachsaliva did you and Pat ever fix his engagement ring after he bent it?
[3:16:17] <ExpressNode> Looks like a door ring
[3:16:17] <DancesWitBalrog> married folks: is it okay to wear your wedding ring on your necklace if you feel uncomfortable wearing rings on your fingers?
[3:16:24] <%ChrisPlaysThing> I want a cooler wedding ornament, i'll see what culture I can plunder for my amusement like my ancestors Kappa
[3:16:30] <@MelBrooksKA> @DianaTheAscian I think like the next day yes

[3:18:00] <luftraumm1> what id diamonds arent my thing?
[3:18:18] <+Prism_Zet> BLACK DIAMONDS

[3:18:44] <Maids4lyfe> just like those M&M's
[3:18:52] <Nancys_Perm> look up stones until you find one you like @luftraumm1
[3:18:59] <Profmcstevie> or if Paige has to punch a dude real hard with her diamond hand
[3:19:08] <@MelBrooksKA> Diamonds are stupid
[3:19:18] <eyeobject> BUT SHINY!
[3:19:18] <segychan> hella dum
[3:19:21] <$chance_h> Fun fact, Diamonds are flammable
[3:19:24] <+Grayhammatter> whom'stever
[3:19:27] <+Prism_Zet> Lab grown diamonds are fast becoming as good as real ones, and like 1/20 or less the cost
[3:19:28] <+CrisLeFortL> My sister's engagement rings uses a Opal, which looks really pretty
[3:19:33] <DianaTheAscian> my mom's engagement had an amethyst

[3:19:44] <%Bane_Kaikyo> ya don't gotta get diamonds, the prices are artificially driven way too high
[3:19:44] <%Dakuu75> How do you prove to the insurance company your dismond ring was stolen?
[3:19:44] <+Mekhet09> Tend to be cheaper then emeralds or rubies lol.
[3:19:46] <Maids4lyfe> shiny sparkle goes with stuff
[3:19:51] <+PrimalDweeb> If you're not into diamonds, I know people who Just wear silicon rings. As their wedding rings.
[3:19:57] <PassBand> "Put on this jewelery to die immediately"
[3:20:07] <@CreepyPorpoise> you know, I hadn't considered the breakability of the stone before.
[3:20:09] <Maids4lyfe> opal will shatter if you stare at it too long
[3:20:11] <@MelBrooksKA> Just get Zirconia Dioxide, they won't know the difference spyCappa
[3:20:12] <luftraumm1> oh so the hardness of a stone is a very important factor
[3:20:13] <SomersaultJustice> opal put on blast
[3:20:16] <%captain_thickthighs> @dakuu75 I'm sure you'll send them the police report
[3:20:17] <+PrimalDweeb> It's whatever you're into.
[3:20:23] <%bravebravesrobin> @peachsaliva get that bitch a diamond; bitches love diamonds
[3:20:24] <Nancys_Perm> opal canceled
[3:20:26] <%cade_calrayn> from a physics/geology standpoint yeah
[3:20:27] <Zeif00> that sounds like putting bad juju in the air
[3:20:30] <rindoesstuffnthings> I've lost the opal in my ring. but it's cheapish to replace
[3:20:35] <%ChrisPlaysThing> 10 is diamond
[3:20:39] <SomersaultJustice> opal is flaccid
[3:20:53] <+Prism_Zet> @CreepyPorpoise same deal if your gold is too pure, can bend and break easier than expected, fittings get bent diamond goes flying
[3:20:54] <Profmcstevie> Diamonds a tough son of a bitch PunchTrees
[3:20:59] <jakernova> Hello
[3:21:02] <%ChrisPlaysThing> cubic zirconia is a 7 iirc
[3:21:06] <+Grayhammatter> they use diamonds as drills
[3:21:12] <Maids4lyfe> canada doesn't have pennies anymore
[3:21:18] <angryoptimist> So: rubies, sapphires, diamonds--good?
[3:21:20] <%Dakuu75> I remember looking into all this when i was big into steven universe lol
[3:21:29] <DianaTheAscian> I leaned that scale from land of the lustrous LUL

[3:22:21] <+Mekhet09> I mean it's close.
[3:22:22] <+Grayhammatter> the chaos emeralds
[3:22:43] <luftraumm1> scratches and stuff
[3:22:56] <%ChrisPlaysThing> It needs to be as strong as your love Kappa
[3:23:04] <luftraumm1> over years its gonna happen
[3:23:08] <Maids4lyfe> the only thing that can scratch a diamond is a diamond, or something like that
[3:23:10] <+Payatann> Hey Peach, where the glasses?
[3:23:14] <Profmcstevie> "mostly sturdy" is a good way to almost be okay
[3:23:22] <luftraumm1> sapphires are cool as hell
[3:23:22] <%tentavision> there are green sapphires right
[3:23:23] <tanarath> classically valuable stones aren't always the nicest looking, as well.
[3:23:33] <captain_elsewhere> @Payatann contacts
[3:23:35] <Maids4lyfe> green sapphire is a thing?
[3:23:39] <captain_elsewhere> yup
[3:23:42] <+Mekhet09> you can also get them without blood.
[3:23:42] <Maids4lyfe> wow
[3:23:42] <$cgreene64> Amethyst is sapphire, right?
[3:23:53] <+Mekhet09> By getting synthetic.
[3:23:57] <+MooseIsGoose> The person I know who used an emerald does not wear it every day. They use one of those silicon rings for every day
[3:24:00] <+typo114> hullo
[3:24:04] <+Payatann> @captain_elsewhere  Yeah! Technology!
[3:24:05] <captain_elsewhere> @cgreene64
[3:24:15] <captain_elsewhere> oops
[3:24:17] <%ospreyworks> isn't amethyst a quartz?
[3:24:24] <$cgreene64> Ah, I couldn't remember but I thought they were the same lol
[3:24:24] <spongeofmystery> Basically the colour of a gem is down to the metallic impurities in it
[3:24:31] <captain_elsewhere> amethyst is a quartx
[3:24:37] <captain_elsewhere> so its pretty brittle
[3:24:48] <Profmcstevie> the date night ring
[3:24:50] <mcarora19> That's what I was thinking. Don't people in general just wear wedding bands day to day.
[3:24:52] <+SaphronBlackbourne> I want an eyeball ring like from RE Village
[3:24:56] <$cgreene64> @ospreyworks probably I know it's just a purple something else lol
[3:25:01] <tanarath> artificial diamonds look fantastic & don't come with a huge cost/aren't involved in crimes against humanity as well.
[3:25:06] <+MooseIsGoose> She climbs cell phone towers so I think any kind of ring would not be worn every day.
[3:25:18] <+typo114> wait did i miss the special events?
[3:25:30] <Maids4lyfe> oh apparently rubies are the same mineral as sapphire, both are made from corundum
[3:25:38] <+Prism_Zet> @tanarath yep, literally like 1/10'th the cost too
[3:25:49] <%lord_of_iron_kingdom> what's blood dimands?
[3:25:54] <+storebrandcandy> Plutonium is good for up to 24.1k years
[3:25:56] <+Mekhet09> I mean most of it is worked in shitty conditions even if they aren't "Blood diamond."
[3:26:03] <+Prism_Zet> @lord_of_iron_kingdom diamonds that cost human lives to mine essentially
[3:26:09] <%ospreyworks> Also, beware of getting a band made from anything too hard. My brother had a tungsten wedding band that he had to have cut off his finger because he broke his finger and it swelled.
[3:26:12] <Maids4lyfe> @lord_of_iron_kingdom diamonds that are mined by slaves and used to fund warlords
[3:26:22] <+typo114> the kelly blue book version but for diamonds
[3:26:23] <%lord_of_iron_kingdom> thank you homies
[3:26:27] <tanarath> @lord_of_iron_kingdom diamonds mined via slave labour, that fund dictators & warlords, etc.
[3:26:33] <+typo114> ... Kimberly
[3:26:51] <mcarora19> @ospreyworks Cut the band off the finger or cut off the finger?
[3:27:06] <Maids4lyfe> millions of years
[3:27:11] <+Prism_Zet> @mcarora19 tungsten is god damn hard, really difficult to get that off
[3:27:12] <%ospreyworks> the band
[3:27:14] <captain_elsewhere> @mcarora19 the ring
[3:27:27] <%KeiganOfAstora> Do you prefer the Miner's cut or the newer cut?
[3:27:41] <$cgreene64> The best option is to get matching tattoos Kappa
[3:27:42] <DancesWitBalrog> diamonds are 100% carbon, right?
[3:27:45] <Maids4lyfe> yes
[3:27:47] <captain_elsewhere> yes
[3:27:49] <%lord_of_iron_kingdom> yes
[3:27:50] <+Mekhet09> If you have millions of dollars.
[3:27:57] <captain_elsewhere> they are highly pressurised lumps of carbon
[3:27:58] <Maids4lyfe> solid chunk of carbon
[3:28:11] <+capnshupe> yes* impurities are what causes color to appear in diamonds
[3:28:11] <@MelBrooksKA> I guess the lab created diamond is more close to carbon neutral since it's made out of the carbon
[3:28:12] <+bytex678> Why do you know all this diamond lore?
[3:28:15] <%ospreyworks> I think they had to actually shatter the ring because you can't just cut it
[3:28:24] <captain_elsewhere> because gems are cool and hot
[3:28:30] <+Mekhet09> Pressurized carbon.
[3:28:33] <angryoptimist> Carbon footprint?  That makes me wonder how they're made--in a sense, ain't it a kind of carbon capture?  Though, that's got to be *extremely* energy expensive.  Explosives, maybe?
[3:28:34] <Maids4lyfe> research
[3:28:35] <+Prism_Zet> diamond crystal seeds its a neat process
[3:28:36] <Profmcstevie> DEFINITELY not a diamond thief
[3:28:41] <segychan> What IS this MYSTERY????
[3:28:42] <+Mekhet09> Are  you a secret jewler.
[3:28:43] <+bytex678> it's just there for no reason I
[3:28:45] <Maids4lyfe> funsies
[3:28:46] <SomersaultJustice> she wants to create a diamond skeleton
[3:28:47] <+VentWilsn> why would you wear a silicone ring again?
[3:28:47] <Nancys_Perm> stepha137Bobroscoe
[3:28:51] <luftraumm1> luxury products seem to be your expertise
[3:28:54] <Maids4lyfe> SOME PEOPLE HAVE HOBBIES
[3:28:56] <DianaTheAscian> it just manifest in Paige's brain
[3:28:56] <%ospreyworks> Peach the cat burgler
[3:29:02] <TheFramedWarlock> Peach "Blood Diamonds" Saliva
[3:29:06] <luftraumm1> or a machinist
[3:29:11] <captain_elsewhere> @VentWilsn so your real ring dont get broken and you dont have to pay 5k to get anohter one
[3:29:12] <+bytex678> The most brittle woman on this planet knows everything about the hardest stone on this planet
[3:29:13] <%ChrisPlaysThing> "Do these Diamonds smell like chloroform to you?"
[3:29:19] <+Scary_Monster> Is it expensive to resize a vintage ring? Does it hurt the ring?
[3:29:21] <Nancys_Perm> do sports, cook, etc
[3:29:26] <Profmcstevie> Or gloves, god forbid you don't get a good seal as a surgeon when diving into people
[3:29:26] <+10deez> So Italians can't wear diamond rings
[3:29:26] <+OrangeMDT> And here I thought Paige was a VA

[3:30:17] <@MelBrooksKA> @PeachSaliva It looks like Zirconia (ZrO2) is Mohs hardness 9 so it might be a good replacement
[3:30:18] <+typo114> kmaSalute
[3:30:21] <+Mekhet09> I mean those old diamonds had the biggest problems associated with them but I guess that's the past lol.

[3:35:57] <Nancys_Perm> don't lie to your SO, look what happened to pat with the m&ms
[3:35:57] <+bytex678> Those are the saddest Pawn Stars episodes. Where some girl wants to pawn her diamond ring and gets told it is fake immediately

[3:41:38] <tanarath> Ye, you should know & have made sure your friends & trusted family have checked to make sure you know.
[3:41:40] <+bytex678> not if you proposed after knowing them for 2 weeks
[3:41:41] <%MarylandJutsu> Also, you can kind of agree to live together or marriage in the next few years and then the EVENT of proposal can be a surprise?

[3:48:22] <%Ranryu692> propose with a ring made out of grandma!
[3:48:25] <%ChrisPlaysThing> That's metal as fuck
[3:48:29] <TerpanderLux> it would be cool to be a jewellry
[3:48:29] <%JetpackMcQuack> these are david spades ashes
[3:48:32] <+Prism_Zet> that's what I meant about a ring with the passed on generations
[3:48:39] <%ChrisPlaysThing> I'd rather clone my pet, unti lthe end of time
[3:48:40] <%CptCreampuff16> i want a ring that can be used to open cool resident evil puzzles
[3:48:42] <$Doctor_Death_Bed> part of me really likes a nice mossy agate, but I doubt others would share that interest
[3:48:43] <+bytex678> yeah there's these places where you can get a pet made into a tiny diamond
[3:48:44] <%ospreyworks> That's metal
[3:48:45] <spongeofmystery> Or the dead soldiers of you illegal mercenary army
[3:48:45] <%MarylandJutsu> that would be....either really good! or really awk
[3:48:48] <%tentavision> what about like, ashes from a tree
[3:48:48] <+bytex678> for  $100k
[3:48:53] <%ShinBojangles> Could a make a ring made out of hamburger patties?
[3:49:01] <+PrimalDweeb> Propose with a ring made of all your dead lovers!
[3:49:04] <Maids4lyfe> oh agate is a nice rock
[3:49:16] <my2k_> if I get a ring I really just want a basic gold stacker, and nothing else. Big ones get in the way and get caught and get dirty, don't they?
[3:49:17] <+bytex678> Make a diamond from the ashes of all the dead blood diamond miners
[3:49:23] <Maids4lyfe> just be careful with it
[3:49:29] <+Prism_Zet> @tentavision I mean, yeah, I guess, if the tree was grown from one of those eco coffins
[3:49:35] <+typo114> Do you like jade>
[3:49:35] <Heyestus> rocking up with a necklace and being able to say, "Yo  let me introduce you to my grandparents and aunt and uncle"
[3:49:37] <+typo114> ?

[3:49:49] <Maids4lyfe> true
[3:49:58] <Maids4lyfe> accidents happen
[3:49:59] <DancesWitBalrog> it only takes one
[3:49:59] <%bravebravesrobin> bravebravesrobin is gifting 1 Tier 1 Subs to PeachSaliva's community! They've gifted a total of 2 in the channel! 
[3:49:59] <%bravebravesrobin> bravebravesrobin is paying forward the Gift they got from jennalynnmeowri to the community! 
[3:50:00] <%bravebravesrobin> bravebravesrobin gifted a Tier 1 sub to grimmultra0717! 
[3:50:03] <mcarora19> @maids4lyfe Everyone will be less careful at some point
[3:50:04] <+bytex678> My uncle ripped his ring finger clean off when his wedding ring got stuck on something at his work
[3:50:14] <Maids4lyfe> @mcarora19 yeah that's true
[3:50:15] <+bytex678> he just had a stub
[3:50:15] <+cascadepersona> Emerald and Alexandrite are probably my favorites, aesthetically speaking
[3:50:24] <+Prism_Zet> @Heyestus It would be a very neat family heirloom if the tradition carried on
[3:50:33] <%MarylandJutsu> thought about blue stones like Lapis Lazuli? not your thing?
[3:50:39] <$Doctor_Death_Bed> I wonder if you could make the actual ring part of the ring out of bismuth
[3:50:51] <+Izzzyko> woter
[3:50:53] <$Doctor_Death_Bed> not exactly the crystals but the metal itself is also kinda pretty
[3:50:59] <$Doctor_Death_Bed> crystals would help
[3:51:05] <+Prism_Zet> @Doctor_Death_Bed that just melts though doesn't it, could have it made to look like it
[3:51:12] <+bytex678> Lo Pan would love paige too
[3:51:36] <+Izzzyko> chakra boosting engagement rings
[3:51:40] <Heyestus> Bismuth is quite brittle, comparitive to stuff like gold
[3:51:42] <$Doctor_Death_Bed> I don't really know the melting point of bismuth @Prism_Zet
[3:51:43] <%Ranryu692> soft stones aren't good for day-to-day rings
[3:51:46] <+Caidezes> Important rings gotta last.
[3:51:46] <xXVeggiePLusXx> Lapis is so soft you can polish it with your hands over the course of a couple decades
[3:51:49] <aguynamedd> KPOPTT
[3:51:57] <+Prism_Zet> @Doctor_Death_Bed oh nvm I was thinking of gallium
[3:52:06] <mcarora19> @izzzyko Fo when your partner is a saiyan
[3:52:56] <my2k_> I'm scared of soap and hand oil corroding things, some stones dissolve in water and oil as well
[3:53:01] <+Prism_Zet> @Doctor_Death_Bed bismuth is low melting point but not like, body temp melting point
[3:53:05] <+Breaknoon> what's the softest diamond?
[3:53:07] <+badhaye> No cap this is nice just having you talk in the background. It's like facetiming a friend while i do shit. Happy you're feeling better dude
[3:53:18] <Kalyzmyth> what about irridium
[3:53:38] <my2k_> yeah 100% agree, this is great listening lol
[3:53:50] <mcarora19> People talking aboit stuff they're passionate and knowledgeable about is the best type of stream
[3:53:51] <TerpanderLux> jermaPluto

[3:56:30] <$Doctor_Death_Bed> I've always liked the Shield Cut
[3:56:39] <Heyestus> It's pronounced "Mackwis" everyone thinks it's french but it isn't. SeemsGood
[3:56:40] <+PrimalDweeb> Why only the one hand with nails?
[3:56:45] <+bytex678> This is like listening to Plague talking about a wall in dark souls. Just strangely engrossing
[3:56:50] <my2k_> cushion cuts are the prettiest imho it looks the most ROYAL
[3:56:53] <%cade_calrayn> it's not called the *Ruby* Weapon Hour for nothing

[3:59:55] <mcarora19> Campy
[3:59:59] <+cvp5127> chuuni?
[4:00:09] <segychan> kitch?
[4:00:12] <+ChocolateMoofin> What would a cringey wedding ring look like?
[4:00:17] <Dova573> I feel like im learning some obscure lore
[4:00:17] <$Doctor_Death_Bed> What about cuts that are at least close to hearth, like Shield or Trillion?
[4:00:25] <$Doctor_Death_Bed> heart*
[4:00:31] <%sleepy_coffee> sleepy_coffee subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 40 months! It has been 40months, the skeleton has become too powerful
[4:00:36] <+badhaye> Jewlery Lore
[4:00:37] <DianaTheAscian> flames
[4:00:45] <Zeif00> cheugy is the new basic tbh
[4:00:46] <+Prism_Zet> oh damn, lab grown black diamond is like, affordable
[4:00:56] <+TimberWulfe> @ChocolateMoofin A Tattoo of their partner's name in a band on the finger?
[4:01:11] <Zeif00> Rose gold is considered cheugy
[4:01:12] <mcarora19> Is a skull shaped cut chewge?
[4:01:15] <%sleepy_coffee> I’d say mood rings would be bad wedding rings
[4:01:19] <%ShinBojangles> I feel like im on another planet hearing the word cheugy
[4:01:21] <%Ranryu692> trends are fleeting, engagement rings are supposed to be for life
[4:01:21] <%JoshManVGH> A manlyband Jimbeam oak barrel wedding ring sounds kinda cringy.
[4:01:32] <+Prism_Zet> @ChocolateMoofin funny enough hand tattos wear off fairly quickly cause the skin sheds more often
[4:01:32] <%MarylandJutsu> its not other peoples ring so who cares about what other people thing
[4:01:33] <%MarylandJutsu> think
[4:01:36] <+ChocolateMoofin> Is this one of those "It's all relative" scenarios?
[4:01:37] <TerpanderLux> decahedrons will be the next big thing
[4:01:39] <+bytex678> How the hell does she knows about all this. Master Jewel Thief for sure!
[4:01:40] <%JetpackMcQuack> no pop off
[4:01:43] <%ospreyworks> Basic is not trying. Cheugy is trying too hard?
[4:02:07] <+Troispoint> What's the difference between basic and based
[4:02:10] <+False_Being> it's antiquated
[4:02:18] <Sunstalker> This sounds like words a muppet would use. DansGame
[4:02:22] <SomersaultJustice> but what if it comes back
[4:02:24] <+ChocolateMoofin> @Prism_Zet I didn't think of that!
[4:02:34] <%MarylandJutsu> SEMANTICS are bullshit
[4:02:35] <+Nekros4442> i hate this
[4:02:36] <$Chatterbox1991> evening paige, eating the 2x Spicy Ramen and want to die
[4:02:37] <%ospreyworks> Yeah, it just seems like another word for kitschy.
[4:02:39] <+badhaye> Where does Vivienne Westwood land?
[4:02:40] <TerpanderLux> theres a lot of minutia to this
[4:02:40] <mcarora19> Pulling your pants way too up like the 90s is chewgue
[4:02:40] <+cvp5127> stop
[4:02:44] <+bytex678> I love how she's speaking in both hand language and normal language
[4:02:45] <%CptCreampuff16> ITS ALL CRINGE
[4:02:46] <%ChrisPlaysThing> I hate these words
[4:02:50] <+Caidezes> What about a chuuni ring though?
[4:02:54] <luftraumm1> Greg is chuggy AF
[4:02:56] <plowingpopsicles> 40 years ago is recent
[4:02:56] <Dova573> As starbucks employee, the most basic is those people who only order tik tok drinks
[4:02:57] <%MarylandJutsu> so are 90s chuugi?
[4:02:57] <batspiderfish> that makes sense. humanity does not!
[4:03:00] <mcarora19> @cptcreampuff16 OOPS ALL CRINGE
[4:03:02] <%Ranryu692> Naginatas are Chewgie
[4:03:03] <hitaker> does it make sense? no :)
[4:03:03] <%ospreyworks> Gamer RGB is cheugy?
[4:03:03] <+PrimalDweeb> It's like she's trying to speak to me, but I don't understand anything she's saying...
[4:03:03] <Zeif00> LUL
[4:03:03] <%FacetiousAF> this is a SEMINAR

[4:04:23] <+Prism_Zet> my tattoo's will never be in style, "cool anime/gaming tattoos
[4:04:24] <+ChocolateMoofin> @Prism_Zet but if they let them wear out a bit, wouldn't that make them chewge? Lasted the test of time?

[4:05:30] <+Prism_Zet> @Prism_Zet i have the sasuke curse mark, a kojipro foxhound, and griever ff8 ahaha
[4:05:38] <%Ranryu692> definitely make sure that the engagement ring has thorns on it so it hurts to take it off
[4:06:15] <+Prism_Zet> @Prism_Zet only mild cringe cause I drew them myself , so they're kind of tasteful, but dated as hell
[4:06:28] <+DovaDude29> We talking rings or fingernails?
[4:06:37] <%Ranryu692> which cut is best for use in a freeze ray? asking for a doctor friend
[4:06:44] <mcarora19> Drop it like it's hot. Don't actually do it tho, it'll scratch.
[4:06:45] <captain_elsewhere> rings
[4:06:45] <$velgaduere> @DovaDude29 ringernails

[4:07:34] <segychan> trapezoidal prism?
[4:07:52] <+bytex678> Look at her hands, the sign language is mesmerizing
[4:08:04] <mcarora19> @cptcreampuff16 It seems a lot like if you get some of this stuuf right, you'll maybe some brownie points. The other person's preference is kinda the only important thing.
[4:08:05] <+Izzzyko> paige jeweler arc
[4:08:06] <hitaker> not sparkly = matte?
[4:08:40] <+TimberWulfe> the "depth" kinda looks like the effect you get when 2 mirrors face each other
[4:08:46] <+bytex678> Paige sounds like a local jeweller
[4:08:47] <mcarora19> @izzzyko Paige *is* Adam Sandler confirmed
[4:08:50] <+RedMaskBandit> a super interesting stream. I use to be into fashion and learning the little details
[4:08:53] <%MarylandJutsu> don't go to Jareds
[4:08:55] <hitaker> ahhh yes yes... go to jared right paige
[4:09:05] <big_oki> jared from subway?
[4:09:13] <%CptCreampuff16> @mcarora19 i meant for myself lol
[4:09:22] <%Ranryu692> lewd
[4:09:34] <+Troispoint> vulnerable talking about shiny rocks uwu
[4:09:40] <macleodtheone> Hello Peach, love your stuff, do you still sing? Diamonds are a girl’s best friend would seem to fit.
[4:09:47] <+bytex678> I've never known anyone who knows this much about rocks
[4:09:57] <formuoli8> exposed as a 98 year old jeweler
[4:10:04] <%MarylandJutsu> Sundowning Clock is ticking
[4:10:15] <+TimberWulfe> isn't the foggy bits?
[4:10:22] <%justicecadet> I don't like wearing jewelry but peach makes me want to go look at rings
[4:10:25] <+TimberWulfe> *that the foggy
[4:10:33] <+ChocolateMoofin> They're MINERALS, @bytex678 !!!
[4:10:53] <%CptCreampuff16> are opaque stones a thing?
[4:11:06] <+Breaknoon> the dead pixels
[4:11:08] <+TimberWulfe> makes sense
[4:11:12] <+TimberWulfe> nodders
[4:11:19] <hitaker> what if i can only afford a ring pop?
[4:11:19] <%BinaryFireball> you ever get the urge to go into a jewelry store ask to see the most expensive ring and then just eat it?
[4:11:34] <+ChocolateMoofin> @hitaker Keep it in its package!
[4:11:36] <tanarath> Paige, what do you think about Pearls, especially uncut ones & not-white ones? I think they're really neat
[4:11:38] <$velgaduere> @BinaryFireball the urge? you mean you don't just... do it?
[4:11:39] <+Hellarussian> a carrot ring?
[4:11:45] <hitaker> @hitaker good tip!
[4:11:51] <SulfurousAcid> 🥕 💍
[4:11:52] <%BinaryFireball> @velgaduere i mean
[4:12:02] <chimeraxmachina> Ok damn, the emerald cut is actually super appealing and I don’t even care for jewellery
[4:12:04] <+TimberWulfe> Cut=shape, Color is no brainer, Clarity is how clear it is/how it catches the light, carat is size
[4:12:07] <hitaker> ba doop boop
[4:12:09] <$velgaduere> @BinaryFireball I'm wanted in 57 states
[4:12:19] <$velgaduere> may or may not be related
[4:12:36] <%BinaryFireball> damn you hungry
[4:12:45] <%BinaryFireball> i just want a snack
[4:13:07] <$velgaduere> @BinaryFireball the kidney stones are unreal
[4:13:22] <%BinaryFireball> i mean diamonds are forever
[4:13:36] <+ChocolateMoofin> Minecraft diamond?
[4:13:45] <eyeobject> But how do I get a beloved?
[4:13:48] <+DovaDude29> Karat isn’t the value ?
[4:14:14] <captain_elsewhere> yeah its a misnomer that karat=value
[4:14:20] <+TimberWulfe> I wonder if I should start wearing bands on my hand to desensitize me. I personally hate having anything on my hands.
[4:14:23] <%BinaryFireball> its cool you know all this stuff
[4:14:30] <%Ranryu692> big foggy diamond worth less than small clear diamond
[4:14:32] <+bytex678> I think we've discovered that Paige is a jeweller
[4:14:34] <Wizardism> I'm learning a lot about things I never had an interest in
[4:14:59] <eyeobject> Paige is so rock smart
[4:15:00] <+TimberWulfe> you could have a diamond the size of a marble but if it's uncut it's not worth much.
[4:15:10] <%DiscoMatador> It super cool watchin Paige pop off about stuff that she's into
[4:15:15] <+DovaDude29> Growing up, I though karat was it’s value in weight in gold, at least that’s what the looney tunes taught me, lmao
[4:15:17] <+Troispoint> shiny things enthusiast
[4:15:34] <+ChocolateMoofin> Value is the sum of all a products parts. Each part's (Karat, color, etc) have their own price influence. Market jargon and all that jazz
[4:15:36] <BedHome> UNLESS ITS GOLD
[4:15:56] <+bytex678> DD <3
[4:15:56] <$hewlettfan96> Hey Peach you look cool!!
[4:15:59] <+Mechanized82> what's the rating of a twinkling titanite
[4:16:11] <BedHome> what about just gold plastic
[4:16:27] <$hewlettfan96> Love the beanie hat look! Very fetching!!
[4:16:40] <segychan> 90's as ehck
[4:16:43] <$velgaduere> Paige looks like she runs an analog horror podcast
[4:16:47] <+ChocolateMoofin> Bout to drop the chewge album of 1985
[4:17:07] <$hewlettfan96> What are you discussing? Jewels??
[4:17:11] <+TimberWulfe> I attribute that shape to sapphires.
[4:17:19] <PocketBearIllustrator> 9 raiders from PocketBearIllustrator have joined! 
[4:17:20] <BedHome> if you get a pear shape ring that means you killed someone in prison, if its a red stone it means you killed ten people
[4:17:24] <PocketBearIllustrator> pocket103Raid BEAR RAID INCOMING pocket103Raid
[4:17:30] <+ChocolateMoofin> @hewlettfan96 different kinds of (marriage) rings, ye
[4:17:31] <+bytex678> i wonder if she talked about this as long with her jeweller when getting that ring
[4:17:39] <+Jonnlaxx> pocket103Raid BEAR RAID INCOMING  pocket103Raid
[4:17:45] <+Jonnlaxx> hi hi :D
[4:17:49] <hitaker> "babe no its pear shaped because youre pear shaped!! dont be mad its not bad luck!!"

[4:17:54] <PocketBearIllustrator> No prob, girl. Hope you're doing well.
[4:17:58] <$hewlettfan96> @chocolatemoofin I love rubies myself pear shaped ones
[4:18:00] <@MelBrooksKA> Getting our rocks off
[4:18:16] <+bytex678> get your rocks off get your rocks off honey
[4:18:21] <+bytex678> isnt that a song
[4:18:24] <$hewlettfan96> Steven universe time
[4:18:28] <+ChocolateMoofin> @hewlettfan96 something something man of culture
[4:18:28] <+TimberWulfe> pear cut
[4:18:47] <formuoli8> like a tear
[4:18:55] <+bytex678> imagine wearing pear shaped diamond for nails..would cut through everything
[4:19:00] <PocketBearIllustrator> @ChocolateMoofin It's a bit on brand for what I draw, so thank you! pocket103Pen
[4:19:07] <+Laycas49> What are we talking about
[4:19:22] <wanna_ben_dover> Check out Thermal cam lab on youtube !!!
[4:19:23] <%Ranryu692> :(
[4:19:23] <$hewlettfan96> @chocolatemoofin Of course, I’m partial to sapphires as well, I don’t really love pure white diamonds, I prefer colourful gems
[4:19:27] <+bytex678> I was just shouting PAIGE DONT DO THAT
[4:19:34] <%CptCreampuff16> we're here for diamond lore
[4:19:36] <+ChocolateMoofin> Ah, yes. WEAPONIZED rings lesss goooo
[4:19:51] <$hewlettfan96> Can you try singing Diamonds from Cowboy Bebop Paige??
[4:20:05] <segychan> good song yo
[4:20:08] <BedHome> whats your opinion of uncut or "rough" diamonds, when they looks almost opalescent
[4:20:26] <mcarora19> @hewlettfan96 Those rings from James Bond that can shoot lasers
[4:20:29] <+Laycas49> You're a diamond paige
[4:20:31] <+bytex678> why don't they make diamond weapons?
[4:20:44] <$hewlettfan96> 🎶 Little diamonds, please don’t go awaaay, leeet me looove youuu!!
[4:20:48] <BedHome> i love em because they are like, $30 for a lab rough diamond the size of your thumb
[4:20:49] <%JetpackMcQuack> spooky
[4:21:02] <BedHome> you can fucking DRENCH yourself in that shit
[4:21:05] <StoicMoogle> What do you think of diamond substitutes like moissanite?
[4:21:06] <+Prism_Zet> blakc diamonds are siiiick
[4:21:06] <BedHome> i love it
[4:21:11] <+badhaye> Ruby Westwood
[4:21:27] <$hewlettfan96> Black diamonds???! I thought those don’t exist?
[4:21:31] <+britishfrog> What about a ring made from old cigarette packet tinfoil?
[4:21:41] <+Prism_Zet> @hewlettfan96 they are rare natural, pretty cheap lab grown
[4:21:59] <$hewlettfan96> Weird having Paige talk about such typical ‘feminine’ subjects
[4:21:59] <+Prism_Zet> i love that they go up to AAAA quality lol
[4:22:13] <%FacetiousAF> cool sick, got it, just need an S/O
[4:22:17] <+bytex678> mostly people won't know ANYTHING about this shit though
[4:22:23] <Sunstalker> But society is worthless PepePls
[4:22:28] <PocketBearIllustrator> A copy of Pokemon Diamond, tho. :P
[4:22:29] <+DovaDude29> Black diamond sounds like one of those words for new things that don’t sound real, like rose chocolate or something
[4:22:35] <vonmaultke> Its a dick measuring contest with rocks? LUL
[4:22:38] <OldOnyx> that and a strictly controlled supply
[4:22:40] <+Prism_Zet> @FacetiousAF don't need an S/O to get yourself some bling
[4:22:44] <+Mekhet09> They aren't intrinsically worthless. Diamonds are used in industrial settings.
[4:22:52] <mcarora19> @dovadude29 Sounds like a superhero/supervillain name
[4:23:01] <$hewlettfan96> Black diamond sounds like some master criminal name@dovadude29
[4:23:03] <+TimberWulfe> like Adelie Penguins and Pebbles
[4:23:04] <tanarath> Normalize giving your beloved a sword for your engagement.
[4:23:08] <jowi_time> all because of one jwel company
[4:23:11] <+shin_en1> Diamond stream, LET'S GOOOOO!!!!!!
[4:23:22] <+bytex678> How would you ask your beloved if she WANTS a replacement stone instead of a diamond without her leaving you instantly tho?
[4:23:28] <segychan> tiste edur as hell
[4:23:28] <$hewlettfan96> Have you ever listened to Diamonds from Cowboy Bebop Paige? Amazing song
[4:23:31] <sulkcessor> ooh i'd love a sword so much more than a diamond LUL
[4:23:33] <luftraumm1> engagement swords should definitely be a thing
[4:23:36] <%cade_calrayn> a sword? in *that* clown house? Paige that would never end well
[4:23:36] <$velgaduere> normalize getting an entire sword set into a ring instead of a gemstone
[4:23:37] <SpartanSeventyEight> How is it going, Mrs.Peach Flavoured Saliva
[4:23:41] <@MelBrooksKA> "And my AXE!"
[4:23:42] <+Mekhet09> I'm glad I'm a nerd and this will never induce a panic attack in my like I've seen those women on that trashy channel.
[4:23:44] <+Laycas49> I feel like our 30+ generation is getting more disenfranchised with "social value" of things
[4:23:45] <%BinaryFireball> fuck it imma glue some fruity pebbles to the milk jug ring and call it a day
[4:23:46] <BedHome> the other good one i like is to book like, two or three consecutive gold or silver jewlry courses and make each other rings
[4:23:52] <SpartanSeventyEight> ...Also, oh god, could you imagine Pat with a sword? Anything would be too big for him.
[4:24:01] <$hewlettfan96> Topaz? Sapphires and Opals?
[4:24:01] <segychan> ever since i was a child i have wanted a Pouch of Jewels
[4:24:02] <BedHome> two or three jewlry courses so you have time to practice and learn what you like
[4:24:03] <%CptCreampuff16> @bytex678 i feel like if she leaves you for asking a question you dodged a bullet
[4:24:06] <eyeobject> Paige no. You hurt yourself way too easy to have a sword.
[4:24:07] <mcarora19> @laycas49 20+ too
[4:24:09] <+ChocolateMoofin> @tanarath A whole medieval style wedding with armor-like suits and gowns sounds appropriate
[4:24:15] <Tytangamer> Really, things only have the value any one person assigns to it. Like, to me, a Ferrari is worth less than dirt because my knees don't fit under the steering wheel.
[4:24:23] <+Laycas49> @SpartanSeventyEight Pat just needs a big belly plate and a spiked club
[4:24:51] <chimeraxmachina> Are opals and emeralds not recommended for daily wear rings?
[4:24:54] <+bytex678> But do most people even spend lots of time thinking about what diamonds or rocks or ring shapes they want sometime in the future?
[4:24:56] <SpartanSeventyEight> @Laycas49  ...thats perfect.
[4:25:00] <+ChocolateMoofin> @SpartanSeventyEight God of War Thor status
[4:25:06] <vonmaultke> Ceremonial Marriage Club
[4:25:12] <$hewlettfan96> Emeralds I almost forgot!!
[4:25:19] <+TimberWulfe> Platinum is so chemically interesting
[4:25:24] <tanarath> @chocolatemoofin Do whatever is appropriate, but sometimes cool is much more appropriate. Also, the wedding industry is a scam.
[4:25:28] <+Prism_Zet> the gaudiest jewelery color
[4:25:30] <$hewlettfan96> White gold?? Oooh errr
[4:25:30] <$velgaduere> Paige is literally Goldmember
[4:25:30] <%CptCreampuff16> gold is for winners
[4:25:32] <sulkcessor> @chimeraxmachina opal rings you should definitely take off when washing your hands afaik
[4:25:35] <%ChrisPlaysThing> Gold Member over here
[4:25:35] <formuoli8> dragons be like
[4:25:36] <BedHome> @bytex678 ive talked to some lady friends and weve always been too poor to even think about it lmao, everyone round here only gets wedding rings if there happens to be one in your family, otherwise you just get married at the goverment office
[4:25:37] <Tytangamer> My lizard brain says I'd want a tungsten ring, but that'd be a problem if I need to cut it off.
[4:25:39] <willyfreshness> Would you say you dig gold?
[4:25:41] <%Sotetsu> I love lamp
[4:25:41] <%FacetiousAF> the taste of it, the SMELL of it
[4:25:42] <%DiscoMatador> Paige Confirmed Goldmember
[4:25:44] <%FacetiousAF> THE TEXTURE
[4:25:46] <mcarora19> is there other gold than yellow gold?
[4:25:48] <+Mekhet09> platinum is nicer.
[4:25:48] <%ChrisPlaysThing> Pat needs a Gold Prince Albert
[4:25:49] <+snakemanmcgoo> hey your doing better now dope lytAWW
[4:25:50] <$hewlettfan96> All Gold is yellow silly it’s friggin gold adumHmm
[4:25:52] <+Laycas49> Her vinky is made of GOLD, She lost it in an unfortunate Schmelting accident
[4:25:53] <+polothegreatest> GGOOOOOLLLLDDD
[4:26:01] <mcarora19> I din't even know this
[4:26:02] <%Sotetsu> fmgCRY
[4:26:09] <+bytex678> Pat is watching and taking notes
[4:26:14] <+DovaDude29> Onyx orb with rose gold band would be cool beans.
[4:26:17] <%ChrisPlaysThing> White gold is a thing
[4:26:22] <+ChocolateMoofin> @tanarath oh i meant i love that sort of thing. appropriate in this context was "appropriate for me because COOL!"
[4:26:34] <$hewlettfan96> What is white or black Gold?? I didn’t even know those were a thing??
[4:26:45] <+TimberWulfe> makes sense
[4:26:51] <+bytex678> it must be so hard to buy a diamond ring for someone who knows THIS much about stones
[4:26:55] <%Sotetsu> Black gold is oil
[4:27:04] <%ChrisPlaysThing> What about Pink Gold Peach? Kappa
[4:27:06] <%Kharinite> getting some hard facts about jewelry today
[4:27:10] <%ChrisPlaysThing> Haha Mario Kart
[4:27:15] <+ChocolateMoofin> You need Peach Gold
[4:27:21] <+snakemanmcgoo> I feel tht way about gold in general
[4:27:23] <Nancys_Perm> @bytex678 I'm pretty sure Paige had an idea about what she wanted, if anything makes it easier
[4:27:24] <+Prism_Zet> They made a solid platinum gundam at like 1/128 scale, stupid expensive
[4:27:29] <$hewlettfan96> Rose Gold?? Is it like Pink Gold?
[4:27:35] <luftraumm1> how do you feel about emerald and gold?
[4:27:47] <+bytex678> imagine sitting through 2 hours of explanation about rocks when Pat asked paige what stone she wants
[4:27:47] <+TimberWulfe> Good Job, Pat!
[4:27:48] <SpartanSeventyEight> I can see why you wouldn't like it on you. "Doesn't stand out enough, it's flesh gold."
[4:27:48] <%Sotetsu> Poor Pat
[4:27:59] <captain_elsewhere> white gold is an alloy of nickel, silver or palladium and gold
[4:28:05] <%Sotetsu> Propose with a gift certificate
[4:28:07] <%Kharinite> how do you feel about obsidian?
[4:28:14] <$hewlettfan96> Do you like Crowns? Like royal jewels? And the Crown Jewels themselves?
[4:28:17] <+Laycas49> Reading his Pathfinder tweets makes it sound like Pat enjoys being in hell
[4:28:18] <+snakemanmcgoo> lytBLUSH lytBLUSH thts fuckin adorable
[4:28:23] <Nancys_Perm> that makes sense
[4:28:25] <willyfreshness> Gregs a good  guy
[4:28:30] <+Mekhet09> He'll have a second chance to get it right.
[4:28:38] <+Prism_Zet> LOL
[4:28:39] <Tytangamer> Pat has the biggest rock choosing metaphor penis.
[4:28:40] <+TimberWulfe> ponder the orb!
[4:28:41] <$velgaduere> Greg did good
[4:28:42] <SpartanSeventyEight> Exactly. It's not so much about the ring as much the knowledge they really tried for you.
[4:28:43] <+vivaldiva> psaSun
[4:28:49] <+bytex678> the stone represents pat's girth
[4:28:52] <susukouhai> he gave u his havel's ring
[4:28:59] <+Prism_Zet> Now i'm imagining you holding your hand up, and superimposing pat belly first over the diamond
[4:29:05] <captain_elsewhere> @hewlettfan96 its kinda copper ish colour, because its an alloy of copper +gold
[4:29:09] <PocketBearIllustrator> Wait, are we still talking about stones or Pokemon?
[4:29:19] <thereaperofcrows> That makes sense
[4:29:21] <BedHome> @SpartanSeventyEight thats why i always harp on doing jewlry courses and handmaking them for each other
[4:29:24] <$hewlettfan96> @captain_elsewhere I see is it expensive??
[4:29:26] <Reanimator83> She looks down at her hand and sees empty M&M bags <3
[4:29:41] <SpartanSeventyEight> Personal preference is personal preference.
[4:29:45] <+snakemanmcgoo> well aren't engagement rings not the wedded person ring?
[4:29:46] <MaesePC> orb shape stone <3
[4:29:48] <BedHome> just an m&m glued to a cereal box whistle ring
[4:29:55] <SaltyTheRower> Burn all bridges gotcha
[4:29:58] <+Hellarussian> im gonna take it SUPER personally
[4:30:00] <captain_elsewhere> @hewlettfan96 depends on the mixture of gold/copper
[4:30:31] <$hewlettfan96> @captain_elsewhere Ah right, what’s the average price of a bracelet for example
[4:30:53] <+TimberWulfe> "Hey Babe, I love all the effort you put into picking this ring out, BUT you overlooked this aspect of my daily life so let's get a small alteration made to better accommodate that." I would not take that personally.
[4:31:05] <+ChocolateMoofin> Have you ever done tutorials for stuff? I think you'd be great at it!
[4:31:19] <SpartanSeventyEight> Just looked up "round brilliant" 3 were the gem cut, 4th was a ring with a pikachu holding it.
[4:31:31] <sulkcessor> i can't wear rings and i hope that won't be a dealbreaker for someone
[4:31:40] <sulkcessor> if it ever comes to that
[4:31:42] <$hewlettfan96> Can men wear jewels and not look like metrosexuals
[4:31:45] <BedHome> @sulkcessor nuckleduster
[4:31:50] <sulkcessor> @sulkcessor LUL
[4:31:52] <+bytex678> maybe she WORKS with jewelry we just don't know it
[4:31:54] <%FacetiousAF> this went from sponsored to just hangin out
[4:31:56] <captain_elsewhere> @hewlettfan96 depending on the brand 50 to like 70 ish maybe for the affordable pieces
[4:32:06] <+TimberWulfe> @sulkcessor same duder, I don't like having stuff on my fingers.
[4:32:11] <%CptCreampuff16> i have not heard that word in a long time
[4:32:15] <Tytangamer> What if you need a giant ring? Like, I got sized for a 16 or 17 a few years ago.
[4:32:15] <+Mekhet09> Are wedding bracelets possible?
[4:32:20] <+bytex678> I've never had anything on my finger, ever
[4:32:21] <+ChocolateMoofin> Imagine not being Fashionsexual
[4:32:25] <+Prism_Zet> If I wasn't so terrified of ripping out more piercings I'd get like a diamond stud earring or something
[4:32:33] <+RandyFistburgers> Get big enough rocks they'll help you win in a fight
[4:32:36] <DianaTheAscian> simple is nice
[4:32:40] <%ChrisPlaysThing> Platyinum would have also been ok
[4:32:46] <+CrimKangaroo> Not if they do manual labour. seen so many de-gloving injuries. I once saw a guy partially deglove his whole hand because he was wearing a chunky watch
[4:32:54] <%cade_calrayn> it's a surprirse because Pat's not a classy guy
[4:33:07] <Ipsenscastle> rings get stuck on my fingers, I'm super scared of them
[4:33:15] <+ChocolateMoofin> The only ring ive had was a checkerboard band and i miss that thing tbh
[4:33:16] <$hewlettfan96> @captain_elsewhere Ahh cool maybe I’ll get some if I get a gf or boyfriend someday lol
[4:33:23] <Zeif00> I'm a guy and I'm thinking about getting my male partner just a simple band
[4:33:24] <Tytangamer> Ooo, I'd want to get something with Lightning Glass.
[4:33:25] <@MelBrooksKA> Fun fact, gold is a soft metal
[4:33:30] <SpartanSeventyEight> Someone's game to mock you for wearing a ring like that, cause if ya punch'em in the face, the ring will leave a reminder :u
[4:33:33] <+Prism_Zet> @Ipsenscastle sounds like a sizing thing
[4:33:35] <+RandyFistburgers> Did you have to get it cut off cuz it got squished on?
[4:33:35] <$hewlettfan96> Diamonds really are a woman’s best friend
[4:33:47] <BedHome> its definitly worth talking to the partner about it, if theres not an "obvious" answer
[4:33:48] <bamberfool> makes the pimp hand strong
[4:33:54] <BedHome> you can do rings on necklaces too
[4:33:55] <+polothegreatest> Highschool ring LUL
[4:33:57] <+ChocolateMoofin> you can always wear a ring on a necklace too. LoTR style
[4:33:57] <$velgaduere> you know what's super cool? you can do whatever you want as long as it's not hurting anyone :)
[4:34:01] <+badhaye> Just feel comfortable in what you wear. You'll always look good when you're comfortable.
[4:34:02] <PocketBearIllustrator> Masculine guys should also not be afraid to cry, I think.
[4:34:03] <+cherrycottontail> traditionally masculine men could use a magic fire ring
[4:34:08] <+snakemanmcgoo> would he have lost the finger without the ring
[4:34:11] <+cherrycottontail> how else you gonna be a mage
[4:34:11] <$hewlettfan96> I did use to wear metal jewelry
[4:34:12] <sulkcessor> you can look up menswear jewellery if you want, there's lots
[4:34:20] <formuoli8> like yoshi-p's rings
[4:34:27] <captain_elsewhere> @snakemanmcgoo no but it wouldve fucking hurt
[4:34:30] <+Prism_Zet> I wore rings all the time , but they got broke a lot skateboarding, eventually just stopped as I got into 3d &CG
[4:34:32] <+bytex678> my uncle lost his ring finger when the wedding ring caught on something at his work. Ripped the finger clean off.
[4:34:36] <BedHome> god you know what would be cool, one of those fukin tiny 1900s french ring deringers
[4:34:40] <$hewlettfan96> @pocketbearillustrator Heh, of course I cry at films all the time who cares
[4:34:42] <BedHome> gun ring
[4:34:56] <+TimberWulfe> if I had to wear a ring, I would like yellow-gold band with tiny emeralds embedded around it.
[4:35:21] <eyeobject> Of course guys can wear shiny things. That's why we have 4 ringslots
[4:35:30] <+RandyFistburgers> Thats neat
[4:35:30] <+Hellarussian> are rings from cereal boxes acceptable?
[4:35:31] <+TimberWulfe> I like Green
[4:35:48] <+Hexidimentional> i have to wear metals that cannot tarnish like sugical steel or tungsten because of the acidity of my sweat :C
[4:35:51] <+TimberWulfe> wait, emeralds are soft?!
[4:35:54] <+TimberWulfe> IDK
[4:35:57] <$velgaduere> Bezos?
[4:35:57] <my2k_> what's the weirdest or coolest cut you know of? or like a weird stone you think is neat?
[4:35:58] <segychan> comparatively
[4:35:59] <$hewlettfan96> I wore a lot of Hawaiin necklaces and cheap Christian jewellery, nothing fancy tho
[4:36:00] <+OrangeMDT> Is orange a marriage color?
[4:36:11] <+CrimKangaroo> if you want something like an emerald but harder (and more expensive) there is always Alexandrite
[4:36:13] <+cvp5127> will this be the longest stream
[4:36:13] <sulkcessor> my parents got solid gold rings in an abstract shape and they fit into eachother. okay this sounds gimmicky but they looked really cool. and they didn't want stones in theirs
[4:36:19] <willyfreshness> Rings are for Hobbits
[4:36:21] <eyeobject> Hi Paige's mom!
[4:36:22] <+DovaDude29> What if a emerald but it has the green lantern logo ingraved under it
[4:36:27] <+ChocolateMoofin> @my2k_ Stone Cold Steve Austin
[4:36:29] <$velgaduere> @OrangeMDT my best friend did his wedding in orange, I wore an orange and silver tux as the best man. it was fuckin awesome
[4:36:32] <+cvp5127> half way there
[4:36:39] <$hewlettfan96> Just for the record I got no issue with metrosexuality it was a joke
[4:36:40] <my2k_> hah my message got nerfed :P
[4:36:48] <%cade_calrayn> Deltarune chapter 2 was 8+ hours and featured far more crying
[4:36:51] <%Ranryu692> that deltarune chapter 2 one was a very long stream
[4:37:04] <+OrangeMDT> @velgaduere litty
[4:37:08] <%cade_calrayn> and far less Papyrus too
[4:37:16] <$hewlettfan96> @ranryu692 Jesus how long?
[4:37:25] <willyfreshness> I just don't wanna look Italian
[4:37:27] <$velgaduere> "formaldehyde", said Paige
[4:37:27] <stratrat13> sipsipElmo
[4:37:36] <$hewlettfan96> @cade_calrayn Holy hell 8 hours?
[4:37:48] <$hewlettfan96> psaWink psaWink psaWink
[4:38:02] <%Ranryu692> @hewlettfan96 it was a lot of "surely it's almost done?" lol
[4:38:02] <+joeyduderman> Is it a blood diamond?
[4:38:04] <mcarora19> Gaymer
[4:38:07] <+bytex678> I somehow feel Paige cares more about diamond rings than the general human being
[4:38:34] <+TimberWulfe> omg, someone should totally make that customization program
[4:38:34] <+Hexidimentional> Diamond value is entirely artificial, fun fact, diamonds are common as hell
[4:38:38] <$hewlettfan96> @ranryu692 Damn did Paige cry as much as the undertale stream too?
[4:38:56] <+PrimalDweeb> With how much you know about diamonds, I'd suggest you could get a job selling them. But with covid...
[4:39:04] <+CrimKangaroo> i know a bunch of friends who knew they were getting engaged and just went ring shopping together. The proposal happened later, but she knew what ring she was getting.
[4:39:12] <%BinaryFireball> lol
[4:39:14] <%justicecadet> lol
[4:39:20] <+Prism_Zet> lmao
[4:39:22] <Zeif00> Kappa
[4:39:23] <+bytex678> And she sips from the cup that is empty
[4:39:28] <$velgaduere> lol. lmao.
[4:39:30] <mcarora19> she was jeweller back in the day wasn't she?
[4:39:34] <my2k_> what's the weirdest or coolest cut you know of? or like a weird stone you think is neat?
[4:39:34] <+CrimKangaroo> alternately, proposing with a ¨place holder¨ ring is always an option
[4:39:34] <chimeraxmachina> Not this
[4:39:36] <DianaTheAscian> wait is that what Paige's real job is?
[4:39:37] <$hewlettfan96> Did you cry at Deltarune as much as undertale?
[4:39:37] <+Hexidimentional> i am a pentunia...
[4:39:38] <%cade_calrayn> lol i'm missing the joke
[4:39:40] <willyfreshness> Paiges origin story is coming together
[4:39:43] <+joeyduderman> It is about the cut
[4:39:48] <chimeraxmachina> QVC area is a go
[4:39:48] <segychan> PISS
[4:39:51] <+Hexidimentional> gosh paige make me blush
[4:39:53] <%ChrisPlaysThing> I KNEW IT
[4:39:53] <+bytex678> Elmo Pee coffee
[4:40:00] <+Hexidimentional> you also said my name right holy hell
[4:40:02] <eyeobject> Paige is a jewel thief confirmed
[4:40:05] <$hewlettfan96> Ewww
[4:40:06] <+TimberWulfe> for industrial applications it's amazing
[4:40:07] <+CrimKangaroo> also, artificial scarcity
[4:40:07] <@MelBrooksKA> Piss, aka American beer
[4:40:12] <%justicecadet> money is also worthless but g
[4:40:12] <Tytangamer> That's why I want something  that's got a sick origin story, like Lightning Glass.
[4:40:17] <luftraumm1> equating social constructions with non reality is a mistake
[4:40:18] <Mahbonk> i wont shame for piss drinking
[4:40:18] <%justicecadet> here we are
[4:40:26] <+joeyduderman> Is it not because of the monopoly the DeBeers family has on the mines?
[4:40:32] <$hewlettfan96> All things are worthless pepefeels
[4:40:33] <mcarora19> @melbrookska I mean, Aussies literally call their beer piss
[4:40:34] <+bytex678> cunty is a word?
[4:40:34] <luftraumm1> cunty can be funny
[4:40:35] <+Prism_Zet> you're allowed to be whatever you want,
[4:40:36] <PocketBearIllustrator> You're fine, Paige. No worries.
[4:40:52] <+CrimKangaroo> @joeyduderman largely, yes
[4:40:54] <chimeraxmachina> Paige is actually suffering from dragons Syndrom and will soon start hoarding immense amounts of golds and gems. This is how she’s easing us into it
[4:40:56] <@MelBrooksKA> @mcarora19 Americans do too
[4:40:56] <+bytex678> It's just rocks, really
[4:41:10] <+Hexidimentional> Lab diamonds are cool as hell, you can have a loved one compressed into a diamond
[4:41:16] <%justicecadet> and money is paper?
[4:41:23] <+joeyduderman> White Sapphire is what my ex-wife had in her ring.
[4:41:26] <+bytex678> and you can get your pet compressed into a tiny diamond and pay $100k
[4:41:31] <$zyberion626> Turn Pat into a diamond
[4:41:32] <$hewlettfan96> You are never a cunt, I’ve met many over the years and you are as far from taht as possible
[4:41:36] <%ChrisPlaysThing> I keep getting told I have a super diplomatic atmosphere when i'm in meetings and people just listen to me without questioning me without needing to better unsderstand. My juniors are in awe each time
[4:41:46] <SpartanSeventyEight> @Hexidimentional  ....Soul Gem?
[4:41:47] <segychan> i will be compressed into a J-O Crystal
[4:41:47] <+Prism_Zet> my sick Family cemetary ring passed down through the generations
[4:41:53] <willyfreshness> all diamonds are blood diamonds in a way
[4:41:53] <BedHome> with some of the lab created ones you can get SUPER HUGE ones too, like, massive. also emerald and ruby lab ones are wayyy low on carbon, you can make ruby in a microwave!
[4:41:55] <mcarora19> @chimeraxmachina Pat seems much more like the hoarding riches in his lair type
[4:41:59] <+Hexidimentional> @SpartanSeventyEight aaaay
[4:42:12] <+CrimKangaroo> @PeachSaliva alexandrite looks either like a ruby or an emerald depending on ambient light, and is about as hard as diamond
[4:42:16] <@MelBrooksKA> Mining is pretty ecologically destructive <- someone in the mining industry
[4:42:19] <BedHome> there are some at home guides and kits to make ruby in your own microwave if you want
[4:42:23] <%ChrisPlaysThing> We have some diamond mines here in canada, those aren't usually blood diamonds
[4:42:27] <$hewlettfan96> @zyberion626 You know taht is a real thing, some people when they die get turned into jewels, since they are pure carbon and humans have huge amounts of carbon in them
[4:42:36] <+Timmaahh97> but what does all this have to do with the chaos emeralds?
[4:42:37] <BedHome> not in an eating microwave tho lol
[4:42:38] <willyfreshness> No, I random commenter am correct
[4:42:46] <+Hexidimentional> @ChrisPlaysThing they're also in the territories so the ecological impact is pretty low
[4:42:49] <%Ranryu692> not until we can start mining asteroids or something
[4:42:50] <+Prism_Zet> That's why we need space mining, go mine that diamond asteroid thats like, the size of the moon or whatever
[4:42:53] <+LittleCinders> I like "traditional" diamonds and gems but part of me would really like Bismuth on a ring...
[4:42:55] <+LucentHolic> didn't one company dump a surplus of diamonds in the ocean to keep the price up?
[4:42:57] <%BinaryFireball> not a diamond
[4:42:58] <+DovaDude29> Would it be more carbon friendly to have a laser pointer on the band instead of diamonds? Think about it psaDogchamp
[4:42:59] <$velgaduere> the blood of gaia is on our hands hotsamWait
[4:43:00] <%justicecadet> reminds me of fur talk. sewing friend points out that fake furs are worse for environment so tries to salvage old furs for projects
[4:43:00] <+CrimKangaroo> Legacy diamond?
[4:43:06] <tanarath> Buy second hand or get a marriage axe.
[4:43:10] <BedHome> also solid gold without diamond!
[4:43:10] <segychan> pre-patch diamonds
[4:43:14] <willyfreshness> Dig up Grandma. lots of diamonds there.
[4:43:14] <+joeyduderman> PAWN SHOPS
[4:43:20] <RRTS_Spectre> @hewlettfan96 and then you can have that jewel embedded into the hilt of a sword so your heir can avenge you
[4:43:20] <$hewlettfan96> African diamond mining has such brutish conditions
[4:43:21] <Tytangamer> Why would someone have a problem with a lab diamond?
[4:43:21] <+CrimKangaroo> ooooo marriage axe....i like it
[4:43:22] <+PrimalDweeb> There's nothing wrong with a simple band, that's what I've always liked.
[4:43:24] <luftraumm1> no ethical consumption under capitalism yada yada yada
[4:43:25] <Ipsenscastle> or take it from a dragon's hoard, they won't miss it
[4:43:25] <%ChrisPlaysThing> like the 600 karat nipissing  yellow diamond?
[4:43:28] <eyeobject> Prepatch diamond
[4:43:35] <%BinaryFireball> right steal it from a live person
[4:43:37] <+ChocolateMoofin> DARIO BRANDO
[4:43:40] <+CrimKangaroo> status
[4:43:40] <$hewlettfan96> @rrts_spectre Damn that’s pretty fucking metal
[4:44:12] <willyfreshness> you see that article a couple weeks ago where deveers was like no lab diamonds bad
[4:44:19] <%BinaryFireball> oh
[4:44:21] <%BinaryFireball> ...
[4:44:24] <+CrimKangaroo> no wrong way.....so murder is back on the table!
[4:44:25] <+PrimalDweeb> A meteorite stone sounds pretty cool.
[4:44:27] <PocketBearIllustrator> Or just steal from the rich?
[4:44:27] <+bytex678> at least wipe the blood off if you steal it
[4:44:28] <%ChrisPlaysThing> Rob a pharaoh got it
[4:44:37] <Mahbonk> then kill the person
[4:44:38] <$hewlettfan96> Steal the queens diamonds
[4:44:40] <+TimberWulfe> I can imagine it.
[4:44:48] <mcarora19> Other product bad. Buy my product.
[4:44:49] <+Hexidimentional> wife and i are discussing options about rings because i cannot wear oxidizing metals, i like the idea of tungsten but what if i need it cut, so maybe platinum or just a sugical steel band?
[4:44:52] <Tytangamer> That seems like a very particular kind of person that doesn't want a mined diamond or lab diamond.
[4:44:57] <SpartanSeventyEight> "THIS THING BAD" person who is in direct competition.
[4:45:26] <+s0lidsnekeater> Punished Paige and her Diamond Dog and Pat
[4:45:27] <eyeobject> I like my women like my diamonds: made in a lab
[4:45:30] <+CrimKangaroo> @Hexidimentional have you considered tungstun? my bro-in-law had one and it looked dope
[4:45:36] <$chance_h> Chimeras vs Ancients: Diamond War.
[4:45:38] <@MelBrooksKA> Shocker, the people artificially inflating the prices of diamonds don't like cheaper, artificial diamonds
[4:45:39] <+bytex678> I loved how in Red Notice is all about jewel thieves stealing the most rare valuable diamonds in the world, for some rich guy who wants to give them to his daughter for her wedding...and then she's like "meh, when's dinner" in the end
[4:45:41] <+Prism_Zet> If/when we get to just mine the diamonds in space, and they become like, cheaper than aluminum or something. I want everything made out of diamonds
[4:45:46] <mcarora19> Ya get whatcha pay for
[4:45:52] <willyfreshness> diamonds are forever, unless rents due
[4:45:54] <+Hexidimentional> @CrimKangaroo you mean tungsten? like i said it can be a problem if you need the ring cut off your finger
[4:46:06] <segychan> loupe?
[4:46:07] <$velgaduere> can't be exempt from bias when you have stakes
[4:46:14] <BedHome> i like my diamonds like i like my women (me) very large and very cheap, usable in industrial processes
[4:46:15] <+bytex678> You mean you don't bite into it?
[4:46:23] <%fimbulwinters> lol I cant believe how much we value we put onto a chunk of carbon
[4:46:33] <$hewlettfan96> Completely random what are your favourite and least favourite smells?
[4:46:34] <$velgaduere> @bytex678 of course you bite into it, it has a cereal number
[4:46:44] <+Prism_Zet> I have a jewlers loupe for Magic cards hahah
[4:46:46] <%DiscoMatador> I judge my diamonds by taste
[4:46:46] <tanarath> That's cool. I want to add serial numbers to stones now
[4:46:47] <+Hexidimentional> canadian diamonds have a polar bear inside them
[4:46:49] <+CrimKangaroo> @Hexidimentional yes i did, thanks. i suppose that comes down to sizing?
[4:46:49] <jowi_time> oh that seems kinda scummy
[4:46:55] <+bytex678> but they did it in the movie
[4:46:57] <%ChrisPlaysThing> isn't that just the French word for magnifying glass?
[4:47:04] <%ChrisPlaysThing> Une Loupe?
[4:47:08] <willyfreshness> Pat is both least and most
[4:47:18] <$velgaduere> Paige you have the least-big big schnoz I've ever seen
[4:47:21] <mcarora19> Yeah sure, Elmo's toot
[4:47:23] <+Hexidimentional> @Hexidimentional tungsten is extremely hard, and can be incredibly impossible to cut off a finger in an emergency is what i'ms aying
[4:47:24] <+TimberWulfe> but it suits your face
[4:47:26] <$hewlettfan96> Oh dear
[4:47:26] <+RandyFistburgers> Overpowered olfactories
[4:47:29] <eyeobject> Paige hates stale piss. I don't remember why I know that
[4:47:32] <+celestialkitty> @hexidimentional I believe tungsten can be broken it's not like titanium where if you get it stuck then guess you don't need that finger then. I got my fiance tungsten.
[4:47:34] <$hewlettfan96> Ewwww
[4:47:37] <willyfreshness> You're like Daredevil but with smelly
[4:47:42] <+spookycool> I bought my girl a lab grown diamond and she still said yes
[4:47:46] <+Hexidimentional> hm
[4:47:47] <$zyberion626> whuh
[4:47:55] <%ChrisPlaysThing> @PeachSaliva  ***
[4:47:58] <%Ranryu692> that's celery for me
[4:48:00] <+Hexidimentional> we're also looking at epoxied fossil or wood so
[4:48:00] <+Prism_Zet> apocrine sweat glands
[4:48:04] <mcarora19> @eyeobject Unlike other people
[4:48:04] <+Hexidimentional> there's other options
[4:48:05] <+bytex678> I feel we get to know paige so much more tonight
[4:48:05] <%Ranryu692> celery smells exactly like B.O. to me
[4:48:08] <%ChrisPlaysThing> LUL
[4:48:14] <%ChrisPlaysThing> I knew i wasn't nuts
[4:48:16] <$hewlettfan96> Poop smells obviously
[4:48:18] <luftraumm1> herdy grassy is my favourite smell profile
[4:48:19] <+TimberWulfe> plant scent good until it's decomp
[4:48:26] <+bytex678> I can only imagine the offline convos Paige has with Plague of gripes now
[4:48:28] <+Hexidimentional> i think a trex bone ring would be rad as hell
[4:48:31] <mcarora19> @bytex678 We definitely got some good backstory hints
[4:48:35] <+RandyFistburgers> Leather candles smeel gud
[4:48:41] <+joeyduderman> Earthy?  Woodsy?
[4:48:42] <+CrimKangaroo> @Hexidimentional are you often in situations that would need you to have a ring cut off your finger? because having anything cut of a finger is always rather dicey
[4:48:49] <TurtlesAndTentacles> what about the smell of Dat Sweet sweet Herb we call the Weed
[4:49:03] <+spookycool> Damn Paige rockin margiela
[4:49:03] <+TimberWulfe> I love the smell of Pine
[4:49:22] <%fimbulwinters> I hate it when I have onions and the odor comes out in my sweat
[4:49:23] <+spookycool> Shit ain’t cheap
[4:49:29] <Tytangamer> Have you looked at the US state candles? Sounds like you might like Nebraska.
[4:49:38] <+Hexidimentional> @CrimKangaroo because of medical conditions i'd rather not get into, having to have a ring cut off my finger is an enevitibility
[4:49:43] <KCfusecoast> How’s it going Paige? ItsHappening ItsHappening
[4:49:44] <+RandyFistburgers> And booze, don't forget the booze
[4:49:45] <KCfusecoast> steebzUncle
[4:49:48] <+PrimalDweeb> How do you like cedar wood? Personally, I love it.
[4:49:52] <eyeobject> coffee is good smell
[4:49:53] <+bytex678> I love how emotive she is when she explains things
[4:49:54] <KCfusecoast> steebzUncle hope all is well
[4:49:59] <+spookycool> Tom Ford Tobacco Vanille is the goat boujee scent imo
[4:50:07] <%ChrisPlaysThing> I have cedar essential oil for my diffuser
[4:50:08] <mcarora19> Is this a redhead thing?
[4:50:09] <$zyberion626> sandalwood is my jam
[4:50:15] <+joeyduderman> Sandlewood is my absolute fave
[4:50:16] <%ChrisPlaysThing> and Pina colada
[4:50:17] <$hewlettfan96> Burning skeleton friggin neat
[4:50:17] <MelfinaStarwind> ooh that has clove in it
[4:50:22] <rindoesstuffnthings> there are markers that smell like that. I think its called fireplace
[4:50:26] <chimeraxmachina> @spookycool strongest yet nicest perfume I’ve ever smelled
[4:50:32] <+TimberWulfe> @fimbulwinters that's not how that works actually. the same bacteria that breakdowns onion juice to create that scent do the same to sweat.
[4:50:37] <+celestialkitty> @crimkangaroo  I have a silicone for daily wear because I wear at least two pairs of gloves at my job at all times and deal with heavy equipment. Just today smashed my hand between a giant metal piece of equipment and concrete wall. it's entirely possible to be in those situations often. On weekends and date nights I get to wear my diamonds.
[4:50:37] <MelfinaStarwind> I like smelling like that and also redhead fhaeThink
[4:50:40] <$hewlettfan96> BO and Dog gas  are easily the worst smells
[4:50:41] <BedHome> i recently bought some of the perfume my grandma has worn since she was younger than my mom, and its just a massivly familar cent, all lavender and bergamot, backed up with sandlewood and vetiver, over slow release florals
[4:50:47] <eyeobject> When she isn
[4:50:48] <Bnighted> Can I pluck the hairs from your toe with my front teeth?
[4:50:52] <+CrimKangaroo> @Hexidimentional yeah, fair enough. would you consider something other than a ring? not necessarily tungsten, but if potentially having something removed from a digit is a concern...
[4:50:55] <BedHome> my mom cant stand that i smell like her mom now its great
[4:51:01] <Tytangamer> Is it mustard?
[4:51:06] <%ChrisPlaysThing> @Bnighted WutFace
[4:51:19] <eyeobject> When Paige isn't wearing glasses, she must track her prey by smell
[4:51:22] <+celestialkitty> @bedhome sandalwood and vetiver sounds amazing.
[4:51:26] <$hewlettfan96> Best smells is female perfume, tropical flowers or certain foods
[4:51:49] <BedHome> @celestialkitty its very citrus forward and first but its great and cheap, elizabeth arden Blue Grass
[4:51:51] <SpartanSeventyEight> Just making me think of that one Stressed Out Lyric.
[4:51:52] <+bytex678> lilac and gooseberries
[4:51:54] <mcarora19> I get that. But doesn't everyone's skin smell a bit different.
[4:51:57] <+bytex678> what does that smell even
[4:52:09] <+OrangeMDT> Paige: I like smellz
[4:52:17] <BedHome> it just smells like safety and comfort to me now, and i want to make that the smell of that for others too
[4:52:17] <mcarora19> That's cool
[4:52:18] <+CrimKangaroo> @celestialkitty yeah, i used to work in those environments as well (degloving concerns, mostly). I´d never wear jewellery at work for those exact reasons
[4:52:23] <$hewlettfan96> Worst smells is BO and dog gas taht is like tear gas it’s disgusting 🤢
[4:52:26] <%ChrisPlaysThing> I like sweetgrass
[4:52:41] <+bytex678> why is BO the worst smell? It is the most natural thing we humans have. I don't get it
[4:52:41] <%justicecadet> eau de bone
[4:52:44] <+PrimalDweeb> Wow, nearly 5 hours; that's pretty long for you.
[4:52:45] <willyfreshness> I find Cat gas way worse than dog
[4:52:47] <BedHome> do you have a favourite kind of pie?
[4:52:50] <$zyberion626> Eau d'Orb
