It's really funny and and feels fairly accurate to how the internet was during the late 90s early 00's. Check it out when you have the time.

[3:37:32] <Naxura> WHY DON'T THEY JUST MAKE THE OLD MAN FOOD SMELL GOOD?
[3:37:33] <@PinkieTheEerie> If you feed chickens chicken nuggets, can you call the chicken you get from them a double chicken?

[3:38:33] <0dokuro> Bitch Ricky
[3:38:33] <%supersugoisenpai1> What a bitch thing to do
[3:38:34] <@PinkieTheEerie> If you feed a turky a duck that was fed on chicken meat for its entire life, is that a natural turducken?
[3:38:34] <derekwst3> Paige we are your boss, get back to work
[3:38:36] <+SpamKingRathalos> drink water

[3:38:40] <Zix_Serro> Gonna moomoomoo with Ricky
[3:38:40] <adamisfruit> I’d assume her teeth have the same consistency as rubber mallet heads
[3:38:43] <theobble> share mouth to mouth
[3:38:44] <Naxura> serious question, does her body compress?
[3:38:44] <Ion_Laser> Goddammit Bitch Ricky
[3:38:48] <Naxura> because if so
[3:38:50] <+Schir> when you share an energy drink with your friends you consume their power
[3:38:51] <dretheroboticdeer> YO THE STREAM OVER?
[3:38:52] <derekwst3> she knocks pat out then steals them

[3:38:54] <%DirtyGaijin> @PinkieTheEerie you just hungry to turducken?
[3:38:54] <VRNK> paige takes them with the same strength she uses to break doors
[3:38:56] <0dokuro> ITs been over
[3:38:57] <Naxura> then her bones are subject to bend
[3:39:00] <+LowBatteryLife> Yeah the end of this stream has been weirdly cursed
[3:39:03] <lupus_man> Fuck you bitch Ricky
[3:39:03] <0dokuro> This is just the sundowning at this point
[3:39:04] <tacostarvedbeast> Paige takes what she wants when she wants
[3:39:07] <derekwst3> your going to bed no redbull
[3:39:09] <Plutt_bug> The average human does not need all their teeth to survive
[3:39:09] <ReallyRedRum> Imagine if she tried to do the door knob trick when she was a kid to pull a loose tooth and it just stretched out
[3:39:10] <Naxura> which would imply, yes, her teeth would be bendy
[3:39:12] <@PinkieTheEerie> Is a fruit pie from hostis just a fruit hot pocket?
[3:39:13] <%ninjaassassin660> @PinkieTheEerie yes, and they make tiny turdchickens
[3:39:15] <cerberuscarmine> go to beeeeeeeed

[3:39:36] <Naxura> because if she can't compress,
[3:39:37] <SulfurousAcid> @PinkieTheEerie it has a sugar coating but yes
[3:39:40] <$superorangerobin> That's just life in Newfoundland

[3:39:48] <%spiritofmojave> I saw that in France when I visited, it was silly shit
[3:39:50] <tacostarvedbeast> Would be easy to enforce bed time
[3:39:52] <Naxura> that might mean that it's just her connective tissue is very stretchy
[3:39:54] <%DirtyGaijin> lots of dead 21 month olds
[3:39:55] <@PinkieTheEerie> hey how long would you have to let human blood ferment untill you could concider it booze legeally?

[3:40:19] <%MrSuperCasualBoom> ???????
[3:40:23] <arcaderabbit48> @PinkieTheEerie I dont think blood works that way, but you'll have to test that out yourself
[3:40:24] <+Archphronimos> until it had alcohol in it, which would be never because if not enough sugar content
[3:40:29] <Naxura> I think it has to have a given alcohol concentration, pinky
[3:40:31] <%QueequegTheater> IN THE WORDS OF WOOLIE, SHUT THE FUCK UP
[3:40:32] <%hawk_rush> WHY YOU GUYS DRINKING CAFFEINE BEFORE BED???
[3:40:35] <blowntheguy> I fucks with you pinkie
[3:40:37] <missingangle> Pinkie, sharing may be caring, but sharing is also disgusting, in this case
[3:40:38] <%starotter70> This sounds like a Yakuza Plot
[3:40:38] <Naxura> you'd have to put yeast into it and shit
[3:40:38] <@PinkieTheEerie> @PeachSaliva IVE BEEN ASKING CHAT HORRIABLE QUESTIONS AND NOBODY IS STOPPING MEEEEE

[3:41:02] <%xemnahort> @PinkieTheEerie I believe alcohol ios formed after at least 3 weeks of fermentation for most liquids though considering how thick blood is it'll probably take longer
[3:41:07] <theobble> I'm going to bed later nerds
[3:41:07] <+pl0xzz> Can you fold that coke wiener into an accordian?
[3:41:08] <reonome> there's beer made from vagina yeast, so why not blood booze

[3:52:43] <@PinkieTheEerie> FUN FACT, human meat dodges most the digestive process, so all the toxins that can be filtered out ARNT, and your liver and kidnies are filled to burst with toxins that leak into your blood
[3:52:44] <lexitheshark> That sounds like awesome
[3:52:48] <+badchoice5> I can't believe Paige is still going

[4:31:49] <$Polarix64> Gamecube games really should have some sort of virtual console release on modern Nintendo consoles specifically the Switch.... even if that does mean that Melee has a better chance of coming back to EVO
[4:31:54] <hntronium> Remember that dbd video that was 2 months late
[4:31:57] <$Kirby_Sauce> "Well aren't you just a tall glass of water? And you just know Gammy Num-Nums loves... MOISSTAAHH!"
