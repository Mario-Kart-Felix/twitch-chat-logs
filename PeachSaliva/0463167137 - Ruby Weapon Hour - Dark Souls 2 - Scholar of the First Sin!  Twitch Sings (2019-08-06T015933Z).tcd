[1:53:21] <Jack_of_No_Trades> This is a fun one, loving Paige belting it out and super surprised Pat absolutely nailed it on WNW better than I ever could and made it look like that is what he has been doing for the past ten years

[1:53:25] <Rotanimood> You pee at the same time, with the other standing over the sitting pee person and aiming for the hole left near the crotch
[1:53:26] <+doc_ock_rokc> Muffins are shortbreads
[1:53:29] <SolverCODO> KING CRIMSON WAS THAT YOU?
[1:53:29] <BappoSama> @romanticzomedy Dude, that song kicks ass!

[1:53:54] <%NariaNagisa> Muffins are quick breads
[1:53:56] <%Sphincter_Spelunker> poptarts are sandwiches
[1:53:56] <%Keaton_x> @GohanEgret Thank you
[1:53:59] <olwe123> interesting
[1:53:59] <$rdark_ksu> no uust no

[1:54:08] <SolverCODO> muffins are just small tasty breads
[1:54:08] <EnlightenedKramer> what happened? I got a phone call
[1:54:13] <BappoSama> they could have sang the muffin song
[1:54:14] <JJnAJjohnson> @Sphincter_Spelunker how DARE you
[1:54:16] <%YourFavoriteShiba> cheer500 Paige, it's your birthday. I'm surprised you a huge brown jug labeled 'XXX' on it. Shit, I think you're legally allowed to kill a man on your birthday. Also, happy birthday.
[1:54:18] <+jjhoho> poptarts are tortillas
[1:54:21] <OwlLightningMage> A SANDWICH HAS BREAK ANAKIN
[1:54:21] <GohanEgret> Dark Souls 2, but every time Paige dies Pat sings a verse from a JoJo OP
[1:54:24] <salty_noodles_> How did they get to twitch sings
[1:54:25] <@akuda_bar> @EnlightenedKramer pause to switch to dark souls and to drink an alcohol
[1:54:27] <+badchoice5> Man, Pat would have done a great rendition of Friend Like Me, he nailed Prince Ali
[1:54:28] <dekkitout> @Sphincter_Spelunker They fall on the chaotic evil portion, but yes
[1:54:36] <EnlightenedKramer> ahhhhhh yeeah
[1:54:36] <+terminallyCapriciousz> How many breads have you eaten in your life!?
[1:54:41] <+doc_ock_rokc> @EnlightenedKramer pat had a introvert moment and paige canceled the singing because he was super uncomforitable
[1:54:41] <StevenTheUnicorn> @GohanEgret OMFG YES
[1:54:43] <%QueequegTheater> A BIGGER ISSUE: WHY DO THEY HAVE ONLY 1 OZZY, 1 METALLICA, 1 MEGADETH, AND ZERO SLAYER BUT SEVEN PANTERA SONGS
[1:54:43] <cureneckbeard> Breads, or quick breads?
[1:54:43] <AMajorTom> For you people - if muffings aren't cake is fruit cake a cake
[1:54:46] <$TeraMercier> Is tthere no one willing to accept the idea that there's overlap in bread and sweet loaf definition?
[1:54:49] <+jjhoho> alright boys who wants to drink with paige
[1:54:50] <JJnAJjohnson> 3 breads eaten
[1:54:53] <EnlightenedKramer> @akuda_bar Thank you!

[1:54:58] <Run44forrest> im not 21
[1:55:01] <%Sphincter_Spelunker> LUL I'm fucking with you. They're desert raviloli
[1:55:04] <Caidezes> Pat basically had a panic attack. Adorable.
[1:55:06] <Zaphire_Saucypants> Imma drink mah Guinness
[1:55:07] <+doc_ock_rokc> @QueequegTheater because you are not a rocker?
[1:55:07] <EnlightenedKramer> Drunk Souls!!
[1:55:09] <$TeraMercier> Fuck yeah, I'll get my boring screwdrivers outta the fridge and drink too
[1:55:11] <+Piemen99> Did pat propose yet
[1:55:11] <Punisher329> @queequegtheater that’s fuckin weird
[1:55:14] <%foreverN2dust> if poptart is a sandwich then layercake is also a sandwich
[1:55:14] <OwlLightningMage> GRAPES ARE FRIED CHICKEN ARE NOT SANDWICHES YOU HEATHENS
[1:55:14] <EuropanLamprey> No Holy Diver, 0/10 my day is ruined
[1:55:17] <%Youwereeatenbyalid> Welp this still slaps
[1:55:17] <%QueequegTheater> PANTERA ONLY HAS TWO GOOD SONGS
[1:55:21] <StevenTheUnicorn> BibleThump BibleThump BibleThump BibleThump
[1:55:22] <Run44forrest> sucks because pat was killing it too
[1:55:22] <+jjhoho> fuck yes ok brb getting a drink too
[1:55:24] <$CommanderSqueaks> So the stream hasn't started yet, correct?
[1:55:26] <MasterDecoder> I hope they keep those in the YT version, but I'm sure someone like Solidus will grab it
[1:55:29] <%GomilkThatAlistar> Fun Fact Brownies are actually Cookies
[1:55:30] <Trash_leviathan> the whole new world part was so adorable
[1:55:32] <Nemesis2098> wtf I thought Holy Diver was DIO?
[1:55:33] <+ItsRatman> are they arguing off stream D:
[1:55:34] <SulfurousAcid> Is a double down a sandwich?
[1:55:34] <+jjhoho> that's 350% too muhc pantera then
[1:55:35] <+doc_ock_rokc> @QueequegTheater then why do you have 5 other ones?
[1:55:38] <ivansonic08> Also can we appreciate how good is volta's animation?
[1:55:41] <%lewdskeletor13> @commandersqueaks It has, they just finished karaoke
[1:55:43] <GohanEgret> @MasterDecoder they might have to edit them out due to copyright
[1:55:44] <+doc_ock_rokc> This isn't the age of CDs
[1:55:48] <Run44forrest> they are pissing
[1:55:49] <OwlLightningMage> A SANDWICH NEEDS BREAD
[1:55:50] <EuropanLamprey> It is Dio
[1:55:50] <BappoSama> @GomilkThatAlistar Is that so?
[1:55:51] <fruit_pie_the_magician> Pat was not killing it and he knew it, is the panic attack
[1:55:54] <%YourFavoriteShiba> cheer500 I meant to say I'm surprised you don't have a XXX jug in front of you.
[1:55:54] <InugamiTheHound> a whole new world and baby got back were both great
[1:55:57] <ivansonic08> @QueequegTheater NO, they have THREE good songs
[1:56:01] <%Sphincter_Spelunker> @OwlLightningMage a hot dog is a sandwich then Kappa
[1:56:03] <$RubberFistFight> @Run44forrest he nailed Prince Ali , that's for sure
[1:56:07] <%GomilkThatAlistar> Yep they are a sheet cookie @BappoSama
[1:56:08] <dukenux> Pat was doing decent actually
[1:56:09] <%QueequegTheater> @ivansonic08 Sure KappaHD
[1:56:17] <Caidezes> For real though, having a panic attack on stream must suck. Poor Pat.
[1:56:18] <darcfowler1995> a whole new world was actually nice but y'all motherfuker started going crazy
[1:56:21] <%QueequegTheater> They also have a Nazi singer
[1:56:24] <Nemesis2098> @ItsRatman No way they had a literal battle on stream over a sandwhich, if they were fighting theyd turn the camera on
[1:56:32] <yficaptions> @yficaptions is new here. Say hello! SeemsGood
[1:56:32] <OwlLightningMage> I'll accept a hot dog being a sandwich over a poptart LUL
[1:56:33] <%GomilkThatAlistar> What about a Nazi singer
[1:56:34] <MasterDecoder> @GohanEgret Oh, right. We'll see if it's the version that came through for us with low sound, might be passable?
[1:56:36] <%starotter70> He can still sing better than me at least
[1:56:40] <AntChodeny> am I late?
[1:56:40] <+king_of_beggars> I can't believe Paige hung him out to dry like that.
[1:56:42] <dukenux> Big Butts was too much
[1:56:42] <ivansonic08> @QueequegTheater Oh goddamit not another one
[1:56:46] <%QueequegTheater> @GomilkThatAlistar The singer of Pantera is a white supremacist
[1:56:47] <+king_of_beggars> What a cruelty.
[1:56:47] <%colouroftheiris77> Pat handled singing on Twitch better than I ever could, and he deserves massive props for that.
[1:56:48] <%JEiddew> pat i know nothing i can say will help but you can do the thing
[1:56:48] <$RubberFistFight> @Caidezes not helped by 2k+ people going "JUST DO THE THING PAT HURRRRR"
[1:56:49] <steph_the_doll> a hot dog is a sub
[1:56:50] <GohanEgret> @MasterDecoder probably
[1:56:54] <AntChodeny> what happen?
[1:56:54] <worldbrand> A pop tart is ravioli, which is a sandwich. Case closed.
[1:56:56] <dukenux> the butts were too big
[1:56:57] <%QueequegTheater> @ivansonic08 Phil Anselmo is a cunt
[1:56:59] <leargo> a hot dog IS a sandwich
[1:57:00] <%starotter70> @AntChodeny Did Karaoke, taking a break, then Dark Souls
[1:57:01] <JJnAJjohnson> @AntChodeny missed some singing, but not really
[1:57:11] <%karatepistolfist> I fuckin felt Pat's anxiety holy shit
[1:57:12] <%GomilkThatAlistar> HOT DOGS ARE AMERICAN TACOS
[1:57:14] <UnderpaidBob> what did Dio mean when he said "you can see his stripes but you know he's clean?"
[1:57:15] <$TeraMercier> Sandwiches are not enclosed on all sides fool
[1:57:18] <takiyami> Wait, when did the sandwich debate come up again?
[1:57:19] <AntChodeny> kool kool
[1:57:22] <$TeraMercier> A ravioli is an italian burrito
[1:57:25] <JonEWorldbeater> @QueequegTheater also a racist
[1:57:27] <GohanEgret> @UnderpaidBob a prisoner?
[1:57:31] <patismyhero> pat being left hanging. Must have felt disheartening.
[1:57:31] <%JEiddew> a ravioli is an italian bomb
[1:57:32] <%lewdskeletor13> fugginDab sipsipDab apatDab
[1:57:32] <SulfurousAcid> what about uncrustables
[1:57:39] <steph_the_doll> hot dogs are sub sandwiches
[1:57:40] <$TeraMercier> Uncrustable is a ravioli
[1:57:40] <%augusta_wind> hot dogs are american tacos holy shit you've opened my eyes
[1:57:44] <nochanceinhell_27> This song is a banger
[1:57:44] <%Sphincter_Spelunker> I always make brownies, but I wanted to try making blondies once. What's the difference in taste, chatroom?
[1:57:46] <%deviljhojho94> Ravioli isnt even real lmao
[1:57:48] <%deviljhojho94> you all got duped
[1:57:49] <%QueequegTheater> @joneworldbeater The "white supremacist" generally implies that
[1:57:49] <+g15835> FUCK, PAT SANG?
[1:57:51] <JJnAJjohnson> @TeraMercier LUL
[1:57:53] <EuropanLamprey> What did Dio mean by Rhinoceros Beetle X4
[1:57:58] <$RubberFistFight> @karatepistolfist he'll be out of sorts for the next few hours. Speaking from personal experience with the whole "singing in public and having an anxiety fit" thing.
[1:57:58] <GohanEgret> @g15835 a lot, too
[1:57:58] <%Sphincter_Spelunker> besides the chocolate
[1:57:59] <Trash_leviathan> did anyone clip their performance of a whole new world
[1:57:59] <%GomilkThatAlistar> Tortillas are a type of bread therefore hotdogs are tacos
[1:58:00] <+windsoc> uncrustable is unfortunately a big cold ravioli
[1:58:02] <Skatedeandre> I hate what we’re talking about in regards to sandwiches
[1:58:03] <NecrophiliacExtraodinaire> On man Metal Wolf Chaos is gonna be out in like 2 minutes
[1:58:04] <+Nobrev> hot dogs very much are sandwiches
[1:58:06] <wholewheat420> @Sphincter_Spelunker blondies are vanilla, brownies are chocolate
[1:58:06] <%segonian> is Pat in trouble?
[1:58:13] <$TeraMercier> But you can make a ravioli using bread, thusly shown by uncrustables
[1:58:14] <%deviljhojho94> Paige is lmao
[1:58:15] <%starotter70> @europanlamprey The Beetles
[1:58:19] <Caidezes> No. Paige is, though.
[1:58:20] <cureneckbeard> They have The Muppet Show theme on Twitch karaoke! SHAKE BAG
[1:58:22] <worldbrand> @sphincter_spelunker well i hate brownies, so i always prefer the blondies. red velvet could be good tho
[1:58:23] <%GomilkThatAlistar> if hot dogs are sandwiches then so are tacos
[1:58:24] <wholewheat420> that's literally all it is, same baking process
[1:58:25] <leargo> tortillas are flat bread that is diferent
[1:58:26] <+darudeampersandstorm> pierogis are polish burritos
[1:58:27] <BaronVonMagpie> quick poll, Let's Dance is a perfect song, y/y
[1:58:28] <OwlLightningMage> Pat is beating Paige as we speak WutFace
[1:58:32] <+terminallyCapriciousz> I hope Pat has the HONKs ready
[1:58:34] <$RubberFistFight> @segonian he had a minor panic attack because he was singing in public which is way outside of his comfort boundary, and it was being used for laughs.
[1:58:35] <$TeraMercier> To me, a vanilla brownie is a waste of effort
[1:58:36] <Skatedeandre> @darudeampersandstorm fuck off
[1:58:39] <dekkitout> Hotdogs are chaotic neutral sandwiches
[1:58:42] <+Nobrev> who the fuck makes a taco with bread
[1:58:46] <%ChillyEctomorph> Did I miss the stream? D :
[1:58:47] <OwlLightningMage> No dick for Paige tonight WutFace
[1:58:47] <%TheOnlyStrayCat> Cheer600 Last stream Streamlabs ate my sub message and donation, but I'll let it slide cause it your birthday. Besides, they were just about ragging on DS2 and offering help for Doki Doki if you do it cause I'm spoiled to bits on it. Anyways, Merry Birthmas.
[1:58:48] <StevenTheUnicorn> ^^^^
[1:58:48] <Skatedeandre> That has to be the worst one
[1:58:48] <GohanEgret> @BaronVonMagpie yes
[1:58:51] <%GomilkThatAlistar> Tortialls are bread
[1:58:51] <+Gerzie> This stream is always a huge mess.
[1:58:52] <dekkitout> Dammit, I know I have a chart for this somewhere
[1:58:54] <Trash_leviathan> tortillas are made from corn not bread
[1:58:55] <Skatedeandre> Polish burrito
[1:58:56] <%karatepistolfist> Taco with bread hurts to read
[1:58:57] <%Sphincter_Spelunker> @wholewheat420 just vanilla? damn, I could anything to that. dried cranberries and white chocolate sounds good Kreygasm

[1:59:39] <wholewheat420> @Sphincter_Spelunker that sounds amazing!! blondies are more customizable and less rich than brownies, so fruits go much better with them
[1:59:40] <%Sphincter_Spelunker> @worldbrand gonna blow your mind. red velvet is just chocolate with food coloring
[1:59:40] <chrchan> nirrabHug
[1:59:40] <mudamudajo> The baby have start to move

[2:00:16] <$RubberFistFight> @PeachSaliva it wasn't Queequeg, it was me.
[2:00:17] <AMajorTom> I think the sentiment was that the panic attack was a result of being subject to ridicule

[2:04:21] <Mrzero58 > Damn paige got fucked up
[2:04:22] <sosuke5> I never liked the broadsword moveset
[2:04:23] <cureneckbeard> Paige get a shield so we can tell you to drop your shield
[2:04:23] <leargo> little loud
[2:04:25] <emillionghost> people left
[2:04:25] <patismyhero> Chat an never ending string of emotions.
[2:04:26] <dukenux> is this the GER power WutFace
[2:04:29] <%starotter70> Great Start
[2:04:29] <+Grayhammatter> you did it

[2:04:31] <Feornic> So where in that Happy Souls video are we?
[2:04:31] <+JenovasPuppet> @QueequegTheater Twitch autofilled it! It doesn't count!
[2:04:31] <%Sphincter_Spelunker> think we were at 12 deaths
[2:04:35] <befreakinhappy> 11 deaths
[2:04:36] <%Sphincter_Spelunker> maybe?
[2:04:36] <@akuda_bar> even i am a mod

[2:04:39] <Louie_Salmon> Wait woah when did she get here?
[2:04:44] <%QueequegTheater> Still counts
[2:04:45] <+patriotrenegade> Pro Tip: attack them while they're attacking you
[2:04:47] <%Breakfast_Megapowers> Is this Anor Londo?
[2:04:48] <+Svanyr> Shpeeeeen
[2:04:52] <Trash_leviathan> why isnt queeueg a mod

[2:04:55] <laserbeaming> Paige, use a human effigy, you are too Hollow to Invade Kappa
[2:04:56] <emillionghost> whats the death count chat?
[2:04:58] <Run44forrest> literally the first area guys
[2:04:59] <ShichiNoBushi> "Let me get my berrings." *spins in a circle*
[2:05:03] <+Grayhammatter> even elmo is a mod
[2:05:04] <a_mad_dragon> they don't stop coming and they don't stop coming and they don't stop coming and they don't stop coming
[2:05:04] <arcaderabbit48> @PeachSaliva Pop a human effigy
[2:05:05] <wirblewomble> @breakfast_megapowers no this is blight town
[2:05:09] <%Sphincter_Spelunker> holy fuck she's at half health already
[2:05:10] <PrettyThickandStrongDyck> Is DS 2 still considered the black sheep of the franchise
[2:05:12] <OwlLightningMage> I'm convinced that Woolie will give up on Gon in Sixty Seconds when he realizes how his lack of plan will make it impossible to finish
[2:05:12] <$TeraMercier> fuck, what WAS the death count?
[2:05:12] <%Malikial> I love the flail attack those dorks do. It's legit always 1 swing longer than it feels it should be.
[2:05:13] <@akuda_bar> elmo is the worst mod
[2:05:16] <@akuda_bar> he does no help
[2:05:19] <StevenTheUnicorn> Kreygasm EFFIGY

[2:05:23] <%JEiddew> elmo is passive
[2:05:26] <%Keyd00d> @PrettyThickandStrongDyck yes
[2:05:26] <benjiFG> he's doing his best
[2:05:31] <%MightyMaxT> Just went & made myself dinner, did I miss anything after karaoke ended?
[2:05:31] <@akuda_bar> elmo moderates using intimidation only
[2:05:33] <GohanEgret> @akuda_bar you take that back, he's doing his BEST
[2:05:34] <%Keyd00d> but it's still fine
[2:05:34] <Skatedeandre> @akuda_bar hey Elmo’s trying his best okay
[2:05:36] <worldbrand> @prettythickandstrongdyck Despite people coming around to it in recent years, yes

[2:13:38] <LodiFrostbeard> OH GOD
[2:13:40] <%JEiddew> lifegems were a mistake. thoughts?
[2:13:42] <Valdorick> Life gems break the game 100%
[2:13:42] <TheHeroAppears> pat that's wrong
[2:13:42] <ShichiNoBushi> Amusingly, it was the DS2 LP where Woolie's sense of direction came up.
[2:13:42] <nootsandbooter> that enemy got yeeted
[2:13:45] <Dao_Puppy> Please play a game with woolie, I want to see them say the wrong directions and always go in the right direction.
[2:13:46] <@JustinianKnight> they super do
[2:13:46] <%Breakfast_Megapowers> Peach is Woolie part 2
[2:13:50] <ProRJHunter> I agree
[2:13:50] <Gray_skies1993> YES they do
[2:13:51] <count_bob> I like Lifegems.
[2:13:51] <@JustinianKnight> but hey whatever
[2:13:53] <+Lunatyr_> they're the greatest
[2:13:53] <%BeefyQueefer> pat is a poop man
[2:13:55] <+KoyaMusa> getting hit is a mistake
[2:13:55] <%GomilkThatAlistar> Life Gems are for me?
[2:13:55] <Dr_Donkey_Brains> Even the small ones
[2:14:00] <Prevot> no Souls game should have things like life gems
[2:14:00] <Neo_Kaiser> Life gems are too easy to get
[2:14:01] <+king_of_beggars> The mistakes are what kill you in Dark Souls.
[2:14:02] <Louie_Salmon> Exactly, you make mistakes constantly
[2:14:02] <Quigsies> They're so good tho
[2:14:03] <%Sphincter_Spelunker> @starotter70 Multiple Languages. I honestly don't remember Woolie's excuse. Maybe it was character left and stage left?
[2:14:05] <krymzen5> they give you unlimited mistakes
[2:14:05] <super_castle_beast> being able to farm them is a mistake
[2:14:06] <%Keyd00d> yeah but you start with less estus
[2:14:08] <+Grayhammatter> a big PHAT heal
[2:14:08] <DesuDesuDokiDoki> they break it
[2:14:08] <gps309> fat gulp
[2:14:08] <Dragon_Batman> Life gems are free health
[2:14:10] <@JustinianKnight> huh no, they do mess the game up sorta
[2:14:10] <JJnAJjohnson> @doc_ock_rokc *fuck, woolie i meant! punctuation is important
[2:14:12] <$Brother_Coduss> Lifegems are Dark Souls Easy Mode
[2:14:12] <HefestoForges> he said they do
[2:14:14] <+BurncoatRapscallion> Give me a big fat fucking heal
[2:14:14] <ittla> life gems are like if you had estus but could also buy blood vials
[2:14:14] <+patriotrenegade> Lifegems do mess up the balance
[2:14:15] <Nox_ludicro> Lifegems only cost 300 souls
[2:14:16] <%GeneralSCPatton> You can carry so many!
[2:14:17] <NeroInfinite> Life gems are basically free life with how often the fall out of enemies
[2:14:21] <%starotter70> @Sphincter_Spelunker Fair enough
[2:14:21] <%Roasted_Pheasant> @PeachSaliva The reason lifegems fuck the game up is having trivial healing items makes mistakes not matter.
[2:14:21] <%DesertPenguin09> Estus is for bosses
[2:14:24] <+ProtagonistJake> @peachsaliva Pat you’re now remembering that AWFUL video by hbomberwhatever
[2:14:25] <OwlLightningMage> You can carry 99 of them
[2:14:28] <XdaXcaptainX> sorta? they FUCK the healing economy
[2:14:28] <%QueequegTheater> @PeachSaliva Lifegems don't fuck the game up IMO, because the game is designed from the view that you enter every single encounter at full HP
[2:14:30] <Nox_ludicro> Always run with 99 of them once you can buy them
[2:14:34] <XdaXcaptainX> irreparably
[2:14:36] <KingKZ> There's a reason they didn't come back.
[2:14:37] <+Tyonidus> estus is for healing IN fights, lifegems when you're out of combat and need to top off
[2:14:40] <+SwdVengeance> Pat advising the use of *gasp* CONSUMABLES?!?!?
[2:14:42] <CoffeeTableBlack> regular life gems were so good i almost never used the better gems and only estus for bosses
[2:14:42] <maharielves> was i the only one who didnt like the gems?
[2:14:46] <steph_the_doll> theyre amazing when your low on estus
[2:14:46] <@JustinianKnight> yea just get as many as possible to use out of fights
[2:14:47] <$arcielardor> cheer500 You and Pat are highly entertaining. If you're brave, you can go down into the valley and pick up a fire-sword.
[2:14:48] <$TeraMercier> @Sphincter_Spelunker I think he explained that he doesn't remember which way the stick will turn the camera when he takes his finger off of it
[2:14:50] <issamight> Life gems trivializes traversal through areas
[2:14:52] <@JustinianKnight> use Estus in fights
[2:14:52] <+Mumbles519> why hasn't paige popped a humanity to get her max health back?
[2:14:52] <super_castle_beast> can she jump it?
[2:14:56] <Quigsies> Wait, any reason paige is running around with half health? She not used an effigy yet?
[2:14:57] <arcaderabbit48> Honestly, lifegems are fine. There's still plenty of opportunities for you to die, and they don't heal you very quickly. They're fine for inbetween fights, but they aren't exactly a panacea.
[2:14:58] <%JEiddew> having to farm vials rather than there being so many they feel infinite seems like... bad. but i have not played bloodbourne
[2:15:01] <%StevenTheUnicorn> sipsipGasm sipsipGasm
[2:15:02] <%GomilkThatAlistar> you tried sipsipHellmo
[2:15:06] <Fujiwara_92> They mess the game thats y they no comeback
[2:15:06] <leargo> its getting populated
[2:15:06] <%GeneralSCPatton> Yes, facefuck them harder
[2:15:07] <Kalcom> didn't jump
[2:15:08] <+Mekhet09> Lifegems are just from trying herbs again.
[2:15:08] <romanticzomedy> why isn't she using a shield again?
[2:15:12] <%Breakfast_Megapowers> They never came back because Souls is over
[2:15:12] <@JustinianKnight> Blood Vials is a bad system
[2:15:13] <$Brother_Coduss> when you try your best but you dont succeed~
[2:15:16] <+patriotrenegade> Just keep facefucking the enemies, Paige @PeachSaliva
[2:15:17] <%augusta_wind> an attempt was made
[2:15:18] <%SirGO0SE> sipsipHonk
[2:15:21] <InugamiTheHound> she wants big swords for big boys
[2:15:21] <%GomilkThatAlistar> shields are for nerds who want to hide
[2:15:21] <%DeadpanSoupcan> theyre basically the weeds from demonsouls
[2:15:24] <%starotter70> @romanticzomedy I don't think she has one
[2:15:25] <Prevot> blood vials was fucking awful
[2:15:28] <@JustinianKnight> they should just refresh on death
[2:15:30] <TMulharin> Paige desperately needs to learn to either dodge or block. NotLikeThis
[2:15:31] <+Mekhet09> Blood vials are fine but farming them was awful.
[2:15:31] <romanticzomedy> @starotter70 gotcha, thanks
[2:15:33] <Nox_ludicro> Lifegems reintroduce the problems that Demon's Souls had in it's healing economy. Which the Estus system was DESIGNED TO FIX.
[2:15:34] <+CandideCamera> Lifegems don't fuck the game up when you're running with a fraction of your lifebar, it's a later item that changes that which does fuck the game up
[2:15:40] <arcaderabbit48> Blood vials were an awful system in an otherwise really good game
[2:15:41] <@JustinianKnight> yea I just mean the farming really
[2:15:42] <%QueequegTheater> WRONG
[2:15:44] <worldbrand> ultimately I just dont think life gems or grass are... fun
[2:15:45] <%Sphincter_Spelunker> @TeraMercier Inverted Camera, sure. But most of the time he moves the character first coxMistake
[2:15:45] <%hawk_rush> @JustinianKnight yea, I don't like that they made them something to farm
[2:15:45] <%DesertPenguin09> WRONG
[2:15:45] <ittla> that fire should be filling the entire area with smoke
[2:15:46] <+TheMattman1313> I mean it's Swallow vs White Rafford's Dedoction in Wither
[2:15:47] <NeroInfinite> Careful near that there fire,
[2:15:50] <%DesertPenguin09> DOESN'T WORK LIKE THAT UNFORTUNATELY
[2:15:51] <TheFilth> I can't believe this was my first souls experience
[2:15:51] <%QueequegTheater> EFFIGIES DON'T HEAL
[2:15:56] <%DesertPenguin09> THEY GOT RID OF THAT

[2:16:05] <LifesNeverHumDrum> !time
[2:16:07] <Trash_leviathan> theyre talking abput max health
[2:16:08] <TurtlesAndTentacles> There was n other way to heal in bloodborne.......
[2:16:09] <NeroInfinite> Ah.
[2:16:10] <%Roasted_Pheasant> @PeachSaliva the reason DS1 is so tense is cause estus runs out and then you cant heal anymore. Lifegems make it so you always can be at full health.
[2:16:13] <$RubberFistFight> @TheMattman1313 ugh fuck that first game and it's weird convoluted system of EVERYTHING.
[2:16:14] <%Breakfast_Megapowers> Blood Vials are amazing, ya'll just get hit too much Kappa
[2:16:14] <%DesertPenguin09> THAT'S TOTALLY DIFFERENT
[2:16:14] <%QueequegTheater> Sure Pat KappaHD
[2:16:17] <wirblewomble> man I just spent the last few hours in ds3 and the 2 hits feel fuckin weird now, why do they just make that thumping sound?
[2:16:17] <maharielves> vials were less bad bc u could kill trolls and get em
[2:16:17] <Nemesis2098> @TheFilth Same. Honestly I prefer it over 3 and 1
[2:16:18] <@JustinianKnight> yea not like Humanities sadly
[2:16:18] <%JEiddew> i only use humanity for healing
[2:16:18] <Louie_Salmon> Well okay yeah

[2:16:25] <HefestoForges> uh huh Kappa

[2:16:56] <+patriotrenegade> Thats a free heal!
[2:16:58] <TheFilth> @Nemesis2098 for me the character building was stronger, but mechanically it suffers
[2:17:01] <BappoSama> here comes the turt
[2:17:01] <Nox_ludicro> Torch system in this game was very good. There just weren't any places in the game where you needed it.

[2:17:44] <$RubberFistFight> @JustinianKnight I feel like the lifegems were almost an afterthought put in to balance out the slow-ass limited Estus, but they kinda went too far in the wrong direction with it.

[2:23:58] <Pinesolbb> @JEiddew you can never go wrong with dynamite
[2:24:00] <ssebblue> and assert your dominance
[2:24:01] <%Roasted_Pheasant> @JEiddew You don't need to kill them. If you set out a decent number of traps, they'll learn pretty fast.
[2:24:03] <PhantaniumOG> and if that don't work use more gun
[2:24:08] <wsintai> tame an army of wolves to defeat the wild boars

[2:25:38] <beefomkers> All animals exist for that purpose
[2:25:40] <valriot> Elmo sees the chat saying "OO HE BIG BOY" 10s in advance then jumps on the couch

[3:05:12] <$RubberFistFight> @Conky89 it's most peoples' least favourite in the series. Doesn't necessarily mean it's a bad game, but it's definitely the weakest (imho) and had some serious problems. Still worth playing though, you just have to be patient with it LUL
[3:05:14] <Thenuclearwalrus> No its just night time
[3:05:14] <+Kataguro> It's just there in the air
[3:05:15] <+Grayhammatter> shit's locked

[3:05:20] <@JustinianKnight> DS3 prolly my fav but PVP in this was great
[3:05:23] <%shockzndrawe> if space is night time does that mean earth is day time?

[3:05:33] <+Blargimazombie> IT'S NOT
[3:05:33] <%velemi> Actually it works
[3:05:34] <+skylerpilot> not a lie
[3:05:34] <Goldenwolf98> Not lie

[3:05:35] <+ArcLifth> Its not, but don't
[3:05:35] <CoffeeTableBlack> Big truth
[3:05:35] <JINcredible1> cat ring

[3:05:36] <+skylerpilot> cat ring
[3:05:37] <+ArcanumMBD> YOU CAN LIVE IF YOU HAVE FIRE DEFENSE
[3:05:37] <+patriotrenegade> You can totally do it
[3:05:38] <Kalcom> CRAZY TALK
[3:05:38] <Thenuclearwalrus> PAT WRONG
[3:05:39] <Stevie0g> Did Paige’s fingers fall off or something?
[3:05:39] <+XeroSigmaPrime> IT WORKS
[3:05:39] <Emperor_Machinus> It id not!
[3:05:40] <JJnAJjohnson> silvercat ring i think
[3:05:41] <$RubberFistFight> It's only a lie until she gets the cat ring. Then it's the truth.
[3:05:41] <+TravisSchnee> Kitty ring does a save there
[3:05:41] <Chaoko99> ambushed
[3:05:41] <+enickma11> No its not a lie
[3:05:43] <%Jjrossman> Jjrossman subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 31 months, currently on a 31 month streak! Happy Birthday Paige!
[3:05:45] <%QueequegTheater> @PeachSaliva It is a lie for her, but if she had full health she could do it
[3:05:46] <%Keyd00d> big pat big wrong
[3:05:46] <Nox_ludicro> Cat ring
[3:05:47] <%Roasted_Pheasant> Silvercat Ring works. You dont have it.
[3:05:47] <+enickma11> 1
[3:05:49] <Tersalus> it actually works tho
[3:05:49] <+Zulos77> cat ring works
[3:05:52] <$RubberFistFight> So it's a CONDITIONAL lie.
[3:05:53] <fullplate> No its not, with enough health you can fall on the lizards head with a plunging attack
[3:05:54] <DRAGKUDO> you can live if you land on it
[3:05:55] <Nox_ludicro> Cat ring nullifies fall damage
[3:05:56] <@JustinianKnight> was Pat the liar all along?
[3:05:57] <Laironx3> shit's locked

We pay for lots in life that we can't afford, but we do it because it makes us happy to put a smile on the faces that've given us so many.

[3:35:30] <%shockzndrawe> he's dummy thicc
[3:35:33] <%duneblythe> metal wolf chaos
[3:35:35] <Prism_Wing> If Cale complied, he wouldn't have been stabbed with a fire sword.
[3:35:36] <+badchoice5> Pat, don't turn your back on Paige, she'll mistake you for a hollow
[3:35:38] <+Kataguro> Cale pls
[3:35:39] <captainpotato009> Clothes are evil; Deprived is most saintly class

[3:41:14] <DandyMackeroos> Paige falling to her death will be a running theme in this. But, that’s mostly because you’re very prone to falling to your death in this game.

[3:54:20] <Louie_Salmon> @the_introspector Yeah it's super weird. I think it was so you couldn't farm stuff forever, and you'd have to ascetic them back but idk

[3:54:41] <majindusto> Cool
[3:54:41] <+Mekhet09> There used to be 4 skeletons.
[3:54:42] <$RutilusMonachus> can you still just use those raw to go back to soul level 1?
[3:54:49] <derap41> So until you find the build you want you can level up however you want
[3:54:51] <+tuesti> yay! just found out Paige was streaming and she’s still playing! hi everyone!

[3:56:13] <Fujiwara_92> Maju lá is the best hub, no question
[3:56:15] <Louie_Salmon> DS1 has a more intricate hub, but this is legit pretty and calming
[3:56:15] <%SirGO0SE> it went from my least favorite to "as good as the others" over time. idk what it was i initially disliked but i got over it.
[3:56:22] <+ColonelRozum> @Caidezes no no no majulas nice, the rest of the game sucks
[3:56:23] <+JenovasPuppet> In terms of aesthetics, Majula is way nicer than the first hub.
[3:56:29] <$jobbedbone> drinking glass
[3:56:35] <%lewdskeletor13> I like this hub a lot
[3:56:36] <DatAsuna> Nexus is best hub tho

[3:56:41] <$jerker101e> Now don’t kill her, oh who am I kidding
[3:56:41] <giga_bit> Firelink is better, but Majula is nice in its own right.

[3:57:31] <+terminallyCapriciousz> Paige is doing REAL GOOD
[3:57:33] <The_Introspector> This game has plenty of good ideas and some good things, but the general feel and the unnecessary changes the devs decided to make from DS1 just make it the worst.

[3:58:51] <%super_castle_beast> @badchoice5 but your name...
[3:58:53] <Conky89> I will say this: This game takes a few steps forward, but also a few steps back.
[3:58:54] <+tuesti> isnt there a thing hiding in a random barrel in this game? idr what it is
[3:58:56] <InugamiTheHound> pat was ignoring Paige for more dark souls 2 which was a GOTY contender from IGN
[3:59:00] <+Blargimazombie> It's ambitious in it's scope, I just wish they didn't fuck with the mecahnics so much
[3:59:03] <%velemi> unless you're in covenant of champions or use a bonfire ascetic
[3:59:06] <+Varnarok> @Yadogari No, you still have to join the Covenant of Champions for infinite respawns
[3:59:07] <%depressed_skeleton> Turtle Power!!
[3:59:08] <%ssjklyco> I remembered you telling Woolie you played it 8 times during the LP and when he asked for directions, you always answered with "I don't know"
[3:59:11] <%SirGO0SE> is that for all enemies though..? so theres technically a limited amount of souls you can get in a run?
[3:59:12] <Yadogari> Ah alright
[3:59:14] <+lordsdb> did paige go up the ladder? I hope not
[3:59:16] <%QueequegTheater> @PeachSaliva Pat that makes me very happy to hear. It's my favorite game for spoiler reasons involving a deeply personal connection to a certain badass blonde lady, and I'm so sick of people spouting MatthewMatosis's video at me

[4:12:33] <@PlagueOfGripes> oh well
[4:12:33] <+MuneXC> @Futurecity10 calling people fucking idiots is a bit extreme. Calm down, you have hindsight because you beat the game, not everyone knows where everything is their first playthrough.
[4:12:34] <%AncelDeLambert> Eli is LIES

[4:13:07] <%Sphincter_Spelunker> Baba is Wall
[4:13:13] <$RubberFistFight> it's probably something dumb like she wasn't looking at it when it exploded, and the game engine fucking shat the bed and rolled in it, instead of doing the scripted event.

[4:49:56] <JetJaguar_2750> You are very right
[4:49:56] <Neo_Kaiser> Nah, vegemite is a slab

[4:50:02] <XdaXcaptainX> YEYEYE
[4:50:03] <Fujiwara_92> no
[4:50:04] <%Breakfast_Megapowers> Spoon the vegemite into the dingo
[4:50:05] <+PauliusMaximus> i eat alot but in crazy
[4:50:07] <DesuDesuDokiDoki> YEYEYEYEYEYE
[4:50:08] <Deekman> No way put tons on
[4:50:08] <Run44forrest> vegimite and mustard??? ok paige
[4:50:09] <+psycosis> I'd rather have nothing
[4:50:10] <%ChillyEctomorph> I'm going to play a vidya with my roommate
[4:50:10] <King_Wolf_Rigger> Just eat spoonfuls of it unless you're a bitch
[4:50:10] <$CommanderSqueaks> A little doot
[4:50:11] <%THATGUY_789> 100 percentage right Paige
[4:50:11] <+Mark_King_1978> So is Marmite but it's pretty much the same
[4:50:12] <kylejefferies> what is the UK thing that is like Vegemite but is like, beef?
[4:50:13] <+pkmamsters> Vegemustard

[4:50:15] <%ChillyEctomorph> Later everyone!
[4:50:15] <Neo_Kaiser> You slap as much vegemite as you can
[4:50:16] <Mornaka> toot the vegimite
[4:50:17] <Deekman> I’m Aussie and I eat it by the spoinful
[4:50:17] <+Intolerable> @PeachSaliva That's the pregnancy talking
[4:50:20] <+Grayhammatter> why spoon vegemite into a dingo?
[4:50:21] <imbatman37> its great just don't eat it by the spoonful
[4:50:21] <$CommanderSqueaks> Pat is warming up the Baby Oven right now.
[4:50:23] <GreyFoxHoundDD> You put butter on the toast, then take a tiny bit of vegemite, and throw that shit in the trash
[4:50:23] <$RubberFistFight> @PeachSaliva yes. as an Aussie, you are DEAD right. The saltiness of the butter cuts down the bitterness of the vegemite - the same reason some people put a pinch of salt in their coffee.
[4:50:24] <%ChillyEctomorph> Happy bday paige!
[4:50:26] <+tweedler92> Why don't they just dilute it in the jar???
[4:50:26] <The_Introspector> Vegemite is the grease found at the bottom of a dumpster.

[4:52:32] <TexasRedAustralian> Is Paige wearing the same clothes as the first DS2 Stream?
[4:52:33] <%lewdskeletor13> PULLED A BIG WOOLIE

[4:52:52] <%zamatermort> Ya dugoofed
[4:52:53] <+Mekhet09> No woolie knew what was happening but wanted to play videogames more.
[4:52:55] <DracaenaLeaf> I agree with pat
[4:52:55] <StromkoPenguin> If they wanted to bang but didn't and they don't just want it more now, then it was never meant to be.
[4:52:58] <%Breakfast_Megapowers> Woolie Double cockblocked himself
[4:52:58] <DandyMackeroos> I feel this detail is important

[4:53:02] <%QueequegTheater> She showed me her paddle and everything
[4:53:06] <Djinnazz> self cock blocking is way worst.
[4:53:06] <+badchoice5> Depends on how important the hookup was
[4:53:06] <bear_breaker20> WEED HANDICAP not a cockblock*
[4:53:08] <Dragon_Batman> I'm dumb and probably not pick up on that
[4:53:10] <Mornaka> Theres always next time buddy
[4:53:10] <%GabeSweetMan> Well here's the thing: Cockblocking yourself is a learning experience.
[4:53:10] <Fujiwara_92> queequeg Just woolied him self LUL

[4:53:13] <DesuDesuDokiDoki> ehh she prolly had chlamydia
[4:53:14] <$RubberFistFight> @Breakfast_Megapowers yeah but he had to play Marvel
[4:53:15] <$FrostMass22> No one has ever fucked up worse than Woolie
[4:53:16] <%SoFarFetched> I had a friend who didn't understand why a girl wanted to give him her phone number and told him her parents weren't gonna be home and wanted to invite him over.
[4:53:16] <Sir_Carl> i hate myself normally so cockblocking myself changes nothing
[4:53:18] <GreyFoxHoundDD> @Run44forrest He specifically did not that time tho
[4:53:18] <+psycosis> You can hit someone for blocking you though,if it's you there's no one to blame

[5:04:21] <xeros720> part 6 and 7 are both freaking amazing
[5:04:24] <+Mekhet09> STONE OCEAN IS THE BEST
[5:04:25] <%SirGO0SE> I would really enjoy another Sing Stream, that was a lot of fun and my initial impression was "awww less Dark Souls". @PeachSaliva
[5:04:28] <benjiFG> part 7 best part
[5:04:28] <Fujiwara_92> STAR OCEAN MAN
[5:04:29] <+Grayhammatter> JoJo: Star Ocean
[5:04:30] <+Fonarios> 8 still ain't done
[5:04:33] <%Gouf_Troop> Part 8 is great
[5:04:35] <Prevot> (X) Doubt

[5:04:53] <+Grayhammatter> oh i'm sure
[5:04:55] <%ssjklyco> JoJo is the new Stand
[5:04:55] <DrFacilier> do one again and record it

[5:04:56] <+Mark_King_1978> Escape rooms are fun
[5:04:56] <+Blargimazombie> Did one what?
[5:04:58] <%SoFarFetched> My convention had a Jojo's Bizarre Adventure Escape room last year
[5:04:58] <The_Introspector> I did an escape room with my cousin and suffocated him with my farts.
[5:04:59] <OwlLightningMage> Didn't Pat beat 999?
[5:04:59] <Run44forrest> 6 might be my favorite 8 is getting up there
[5:04:59] <+hoenhime344> paige wants to touch
[5:05:00] <+Blargimazombie> Oh

[5:05:03] <Djinnazz> oh yeah, the one where Pat couldn't refh the keys.
[5:05:03] <MicrotonalMatt> Star Ocean Till the End of Time is the most disappointing series since Xenosaga

[5:23:57] <LucLearns> did i miss ds2 stream?
[5:23:57] <The_Introspector> "I made Troy Baker walk away scared because I sang about barely legal Spider-Man."
[5:24:02] <%moranprime> moranprime subscribed with Twitch Prime. They've subscribed for 2 months, currently on a 1 month streak! Woot!

[5:24:12] <%ssjklyco> ssjklyco gifted a Tier 1 sub to bevyrage! This is their first Gift Sub in the channel! 
[5:24:15] <GreyFoxHoundDD> And I did both at the same time. It was the worst.
[5:24:17] <DrFacilier> invisible weapons
[5:24:17] <rytisone> there are people that beat the game with no damage
[5:24:23] <+badchoice5> No, deathless is 10 times as hard as no bonfire
[5:24:24] <+Blargimazombie> Rings that make weapons invisible
[5:24:30] <CurrySauseBandit> It's not that insane. Just don't suck.
[5:24:35] <%legendfather_of_giants> @PeachSaliva so Lobos
[5:24:35] <%SirGO0SE> your pc turns into hatsune miku and gives you a handy
[5:24:35] <The_Introspector> Now you can roleplay Saber from Fate/SN
[5:24:35] <%ssjklyco> @bevyrage you get a gift sub for that
[5:24:37] <%bevyrage> @ssjklyco Thanks mang. Didn't realize I was unsubbed.
[5:24:38] <FrustratedAF> rings that make vvymyn a big strong
[5:24:39] <TheChillRoom> The invis rings are great for PvP memes but not much else
[5:24:40] <Djinnazz> no Death is easy
[5:24:40] <DandyMackeroos> An undead bj
[5:24:44] <%bevyrage> = v =]b
[5:24:46] <+Blargimazombie> You can light bnfires, but not sit at them, that makes it doabe
[5:24:49] <xeros720> happy birthday, question mark
[5:24:49] <+Blargimazombie> I did it
[5:24:50] <majindusto> GIT GUD
[5:24:54] <+jessedouglas> No hit runs are fucking nuts
[5:24:55] <+badchoice5> No bonfire is long and frustrating, No death is hell
[5:24:58] <+Blargimazombie> But not the no death one
[5:25:04] <%shockzndrawe> Is elmo a gremlin
[5:25:05] <GreyFoxHoundDD> No deaths is not too bad, but no bonfires sucks because you have to walk everywhere
[5:25:06] <CurrySauseBandit> No hit is hard af though
[5:25:07] <%ThePabe> Paige still waiting for Pat to give her the ring that makes her invisiblessed
[5:25:09] <%SoFarFetched> baselard?
[5:25:10] <King_Wolf_Rigger> just need a healer for the Aery now, as long as these deeps don't coward out

[5:25:37] <The_Introspector> What the hell was that?!
[5:25:39] <TheChillRoom> Saddest dabs
[5:25:39] <mayorrev> dabsabled
[5:25:40] <+badchoice5> Ever try jumping down to the Gutter where a misstep loses 4-5 hours of progress?
[5:25:44] <%moranprime> Prepare to Dab
[5:25:45] <CurrySauseBandit> @greyfoxhounddd Gotta come in with a positive mindset on those runs. It'a not to terrible when you accept the runbacks
[5:25:45] <+pkmamsters> If you dab in the game. You dab in real life.
[5:25:45] <%SirGO0SE> dabsabled
[5:25:46] <%depressed_skeleton> I am a skeleton and i can dab twice as good.
[5:25:48] <SulfurousAcid> you gotta dab away the pain @PeachSaliva
[5:25:51] <Mornaka> Advanced Dabbing
[5:25:54] <CopperTucker> Elder Dab
[5:25:56] <Run44forrest> dab souls
[5:25:57] <The_Introspector> Paige is a senior citizen.
[5:26:02] <%depressed_skeleton> dabdabdabdab
[5:26:02] <TheChillRoom> @badchoice5 That's specifically what ended my one and only no bonfire run
[5:26:04] <King_Wolf_Rigger> You dabbed so hard, you couldn't dab no more
[5:26:07] <%ssjklyco> Paige needs to buy 10 glasses and hide them around the house
[5:26:12] <+jessedouglas> Dabsabled
[5:26:22] <CurrySauseBandit> @greyfoxhounddd That's my opinion anyway. o:
[5:26:24] <rytisone> dabbing is for young people
[5:26:27] <GreyFoxHoundDD> @CurrySauseBandit Which is fine to do, but it still doesn't make it fun
[5:26:28] <The_Introspector> We blew our budget!
[5:26:38] <+IMDRanged> So, they pulled a Konami
[5:26:46] <+badchoice5> @TheChillRoom The trick that makes no bonfire much easier is to only light the Majula bonfire, so that you can always homeward bone back to hub
[5:26:48] <+QuadraticGravity> I think apartments have stables
[5:26:49] <%TheSniperJoe> I can answer they moved the studio across the sea. It actually didn't have anything to do with contracts.
[5:26:49] <bsmusic> LUL
[5:26:49] <%moranprime> Is everyone Troy Baker in FF14 Kappa
[5:26:50] <SulfurousAcid> @PeachSaliva get ice cream cake

[5:27:12] <Roz_Lynd> youtube and nonstop streams of you guys
[5:27:21] <Run44forrest> whats the point of lighting bonfires if you cant use it
[5:27:23] <%TheSniperJoe> The cast is almost entirely from Europe now, they used largely L.A talent before but it wasn't a union gig.
[5:27:24] <Roz_Lynd> i think my favorite is pat's love for littering
[5:27:27] <DrFacilier> the old shitty baby camera
[5:27:35] <TheChillRoom> @badchoice5 That's actually brilliant. I might have to give that a go
[5:27:36] <Dragon_Batman> Awww yea those were the times
[5:27:41] <rytisone> SBFP RE2
[5:27:43] <%ssjklyco> I hated the reverse camera.

[5:28:22] <ShichiNoBushi> "Santa is REAL!!"

[5:35:39] <MasterDecoder> @Dragon_Batman Some moron on Twitter being a stupid moron
[5:35:40] <%depressed_skeleton> Deep water doesn't exist if you don't think about it.
[5:35:42] <Zaphire_Saucypants> "Oh, it's a long story, Batman." God that sounded absurd even to me
[5:35:49] <T_Sasquatch> Fuck the ocean
[5:35:49] <Mornaka> Which is worse? Space or ocean?
[5:35:50] <+hoenhime344> there is no other medium where someone named "Dragon Batman" is the least questionable thing about the content
[5:35:53] <Run44forrest> just go upside down pat
[5:35:54] <%moranprime> There's actual spooky monsters underwater
[5:35:54] <+AntithesisEK> is anti-love stronger than a hatred?

[5:35:56] <TheChillRoom> Molyneux is.. a character. And that character's main trait is Being Wrong. But not in a fun way like Crazy Talk
[5:35:56] <Valdorick> But what color is the ocean? Is it a deep dark blue?

[5:45:27] <+spawnzie> Jesus
[5:45:28] <bear_breaker20> fake it till you die*
[5:45:33] <Mornaka> I had an Ex that had a HORRIBLE sense of direction but walked with ULTIMATE CONFIDENCE
[5:45:36] <%SoFarFetched> you mean him and bevy rage?
[5:45:37] <Youknowwhyimhere008> atpCap
[5:45:40] <%Lumkins> The one where they brain fucked
[5:45:44] <Mornaka> We got lost a lot
[5:45:45] <+riderstrike152> Even if a car is going in reverse, you're still going somewhere
[5:45:49] <+ImpHelpSingIt> actually it was the transporter
[5:45:53] <+stantashev> PixelBob PixelBob cool story Pat

[5:45:57] <+jessedouglas> enigmaL apatJpeg enigmaR
[5:46:01] <FairOnFire> like Kamina
[5:46:02] <+spawnzie> WHO SAID THAT
[5:46:04] <%Kazooki_Kazami> Paige IS Picard
[5:46:09] <Ion_Laser> WHO'S TALKING
[5:46:10] <+Blargimazombie> The word I did wrong for a long time was omnipotent
[5:46:11] <GreyFoxHoundDD> And fuckin dies
[5:46:12] <%Sphincter_Spelunker> nerd
[5:46:15] <$RubberFistFight> Yeah he was like "of course I have no idea where to go, but I'm the captain, it's up to me to make SOME kind of decision and take the responsibility for it"
[5:46:19] <majindusto> DINOBOT BibleThump
[5:46:23] <%shockzndrawe> Dinobot vored his clone tho
[5:46:26] <zamzoph> He gets better. But evil.
[5:46:26] <The_Introspector> I'm only on S2 of TNG. Does Beverley come back cause the doctor they got to replace her is a bitch to Data.
[5:46:27] <Mornaka> GOKU NOOOO
[5:46:30] <Run44forrest> BigBossSalute
[5:46:35] <FairOnFire> Paige is literally Kamina. Swapping spit with yoko like true chad

[5:47:06] <$RubberFistFight> @The_Introspector yes she does. Pulaski was early TNG's attempt to ape Bones from TOS - remember how he was prickly to Spock, and TNG's Spock was Data (more or less)?

[5:47:58] <%shockzndrawe> fun fact, Beast Wars was called "Beasties" in canada for some fucking reason
[5:47:59] <TheChillRoom> @PeachSaliva The art direction was real good. That plant lady fucked me up though. That's a no thank you from me
[5:48:00] <+badchoice5> I have to sleep guys, I have a real job tomorrow

[5:48:03] <Mornaka> BEAST MACHINES WAS ODD AND I DIDN'T LIKE CHANGE
[5:48:06] <%ssjklyco> They ruined everything
[5:48:07] <+AntithesisEK> limiter released for .16 seconds
[5:48:08] <+MisterRockett> Beast Machines Rat Trap was SO BAD
[5:48:11] <+badchoice5> And Pat is gonna be late to the podcast again
[5:48:12] <Valdorick> "What if we just give the rat FUCKING WHEELS!?" "RADICAL!"
[5:48:14] <%Sphincter_Spelunker> Stay focused, Paige
[5:48:14] <Panquake25> Beast machines looked neat. Didn't have much else going for it
[5:48:17] <+MisterRockett> WHY WAS HE A CHILD????
[5:48:19] <%depressed_skeleton> Remember when Optimus Primal sacrificed himself & All the transformers returned to the planet Skipping & dancing?!
[5:48:20] <kylejefferies> inb4 Paige forgets to read the rest of my donation

[5:48:32] <zamzoph> @Valdorick he ALREADY had wheels!
[5:48:33] <Valdorick> Pat breaking
[5:48:36] <%moranprime> Whoops. I didn't know that would derail this stream. My bad.
[5:48:36] <Dragon_Batman> I remember liking Cheetor or whatever enough to get a toy
[5:48:45] <%THATGUY_789> Paige was gas lit by beast machines
[5:48:45] <%shockzndrawe> *bunch
[5:48:50] <%depressed_skeleton> Unfocus, let it all blur, wanted taught me this.
[5:48:53] <%ssjklyco> They ruined Rhinox
[5:48:53] <Mornaka> @jessedouglas 1 pm est
[5:48:58] <InugamiTheHound> where's your focus, kyle!
[5:49:05] <zamzoph> I liked evil Rhinox tho
[5:49:17] <%shockzndrawe> ye
[5:49:20] <JDebss> Seriously though, I've got an extra garbage truck transformer and he's already got a beard. Should I make a Pat custom?
[5:49:22] <+TheBrazilianHope> Why is there a picture of PeachSaliva behind them on the couch?
[5:49:23] <%depressed_skeleton> Dinobots sacrifice always makes me tear up
[5:49:31] <%shockzndrawe> I'm afraid people think I have alretior motives when I'm nice

[5:49:35] <%Breakfast_Megapowers> FUCK YOU FOR BEING SO NICE
[5:49:38] <GreyFoxHoundDD> I come off as a huge asshole and horribly depressed when I say what I'm thinking.
[5:49:40] <%THATGUY_789> Tigertron was underutilized
[5:49:41] <%zamatermort> Beast machines was fine
[5:49:45] <DracaenaLeaf> Lmao
[5:49:46] <majindusto> Reminder that in canada "Beast Wars" was called BEASTIES
[5:49:52] <%ssjklyco> Lupus mode
[5:49:54] <Mornaka> TIGERTRON WAS THE BEST
[5:49:54] <%shockzndrawe> what about TRANSMUTATE
[5:49:55] <%Sphincter_Spelunker> @THATGUY_789 you're being that guy
[5:50:01] <+IMDRanged> Damnit I tried to forget Beast Machines existed.
[5:50:01] <+mrcooperblack> i'm too drunk what's happening here?
[5:50:02] <+Zulos77> Lupus trigger
[5:50:05] <%shockzndrawe> remember TRANSMUTATE

[5:50:51] <+RadSuit> @PeachSaliva I know someone who did a Beast Wars/Machines podcast if you want some expert help.
[5:50:51] <Panquake25> TigerHawk got shafted hard
[5:50:56] <%THATGUY_789> the Noble silverbolt
[5:50:57] <+MisterRockett> Air Razor was written out of the show before her toy came out.
