[0:18:12] <%AncelDeLambert> I ABHORE cringe
[0:18:12] <%starotter70> It's STRONG Cringe
[0:18:14] <%Hobojo153> I recently showed a friend Always Sunny for the first time and he couldn't take it.
[0:18:14] <@Jekado> after a while the seasons get too bad
[0:18:15] <$Sphincter_Spelunker> I think my first episode was Dennis and Dee getting hooked on crack
[0:18:15] <karmahoudini_guitar> please watch the anime Watamote
[0:18:16] <Djinnazz> WHy, that shits funny.
[0:18:17] <%spiritofmojave> Curb and that have like the title for hardest to get through
[0:18:17] <@Jekado> i stopped
[0:18:17] <coldinnovation> i absolutely feel that sometimes
[0:18:18] <%TheWinged7> Watch Konosuba already
[0:18:18] <Ronaxsis> Agreed
[0:18:25] <appletumtum> WOW
[0:18:26] <cureneckbeard> red aqua
[0:18:27] <%AncelDeLambert> I can't watch Always Sunny, it hurts me
[0:18:27] <+Invlux> Kappa
[0:18:27] <%czeekyplays> I feel the same way when watching Always Sunny
[0:18:28] <%BourneWarrior> WATAMOTE IS SO BAD
[0:18:28] <%February_Croft> IT'S ALWAYS SUNNY IS HILARIOUS 😂
[0:18:29] <LSpiral> unclench , peach
[0:18:30] <%mighty_max_t> I'm a cringe pauser. I pause to get trhough the cringe
[0:18:30] <thesickestzak> It is the best worst feeling
[0:18:31] <%twistedj3ster> the blackface baby is the worst
[0:18:31] <terribleusername> the command center
[0:18:31] <%QueequegTheater> Wait isn't that for everyone?
[0:18:33] <notorious_rng> if youre like that on season 1 then woo boy
[0:18:34] <LSpiral> learn to unclench
[0:18:35] <%Hobojo153> How the best is Frank
[0:18:35] <%TalisKanju> Season 1 is like the worst season of Always Sunny
[0:18:35] <+Taglog7> psaDab psaDab psaDab
[0:18:36] <GarbageQueenEllie> Poopdeck is the wheel?
[0:18:37] <l33tc4k3> always sunny is 'just' about bearable for me in terms of cringe
[0:18:37] <%optimasmaximas> ???
[0:18:37] <DensityD> sounds like you want more anal sexy time Kreygasm
[0:18:37] <%depressed_skeleton> spin the wheel
[0:18:38] <+McSoliace> just pause for 5 minutes every 30 seconds like i do
[0:18:39] <%darcfowler1995> That’s the best episode though
[0:18:41] <+Invlux> The wheel is on the Poop Deck
[0:18:42] <@SoFarFetched> yeah
[0:18:44] <colouroftheiris77> Is it good? Charlie Day seems insufferable to watch for more than one episode at a time.
[0:18:45] <%spiritofmojave> you have to
[0:18:46] <%deafmutelaughing> I pause and stop watching for 30 minutes
[0:18:46] <%mighty_max_t> Yup
[0:18:48] <%ringabal> You guys see those scripts for the SBFP Always Sunny bits?
[0:18:48] <Mr_Strut> You spin it?
[0:18:49] <%ElenaManetta> I love cringe
[0:18:50] <mobiusnightshade> That's Pat's character! He's the Trashman! He eats your garbage!
[0:18:50] <abelincoln_catpuncher> oh yeah
[0:18:52] <+captainpodock> you have to cringe through
[0:18:53] <$Sphincter_Spelunker> They're charactures, Watamote is so much worse
[0:18:58] <%QueequegTheater> @Patstaresat has she got to the crack episode
[0:18:58] <%kawajenarts> the secondhand embarrassment is strong with that show
[0:19:01] <JZPotter> I honestly don't find Always Sunny to be cringe
[0:19:01] <%ShichiNoBushi> Would you put Wesley Crusher at your wheel?
[0:19:02] <Silent_Fyraena> Insert stick into Peach butthole to convert wheel to tiller? :0
[0:19:04] <%spiritofmojave> oh Seinfeld ain't that bad
[0:19:04] <%ElenaManetta> Cringe makes me feel better about myself
[0:19:07] <%optimasmaximas> @notorious_rng what show are we talkin about? was lookin at my phone and spaced out
[0:19:08] <+genowyn> Contrapoints' new video is a great deep dive about cringe
[0:19:08] <%BallerSwagBro9k> Im immune to cringe now
[0:19:08] <Ronaxsis> also agree
[0:19:09] <General_Terro> "OH SHIT" .. "im ok"
[0:19:12] <%ElenaManetta> It's like hey could be worse, could be that guy
[0:19:16] <%TalisKanju> The crack episode is in Season 2
[0:19:20] <terribleusername> Curb is hard to get through sometimes
[0:19:20] <$Sphincter_Spelunker> I meant caricatures, woops
[0:19:20] <$Tredecian> cheer250 I really appreciate the stream today, thanks miss saliva. also serious personal question for pat : what did the baseball say to the bat when he showed up for their date? "I'm sphere"
[0:19:21] <%spiritofmojave> yeeep
[0:19:22] <%Dementedpenguin> Always Sunny is fantastic if you embrace cringe.
[0:19:22] <$Draylle> Im that way with Nathan for You and Eric Andre. cringe in short bursts
[0:19:24] <Mr_Strut> Curb is fucking great
[0:19:24] <+hibbleshibble> What do they call that second hand embarrassment? I believe there's several languages with that word.
[0:19:26] <%ElenaManetta> hey guys remember the Office episode "Andy's Play"
[0:19:26] <GarbageQueenEllie> Some kinds of comedic storyline just make me mad. Why is that?
[0:19:27] <%Hobojo153> Episode 1 is literally called "The Gang gets Racist" and they don't slow down
[0:19:30] <notorious_rng> @optimasmaximas always sunny
[0:19:33] <fairore> @ballerswagbro9k your a fucking liar
[0:19:34] <+corgispudmen> I alway leave the room when cringe shows up
[0:19:36] <%QueequegTheater> As it turns out, Larry David is LITERALLY just George
[0:19:36] <lotharrio> His kids loved the show.
[0:19:36] <+cereal_box_conspiracy> he's the only reason the show is good
[0:19:36] <%February_Croft> @jzpotter SUICIDE IS BADASS
[0:19:37] <DrakanAroh> Watamote is infact worsek but idk Sunny isn't that bad. could be desensitized to it now tho tbh
[0:19:37] <zamzoph> Danny isn't in season 1 ?!
[0:19:38] <karmahoudini_guitar> show is much better with deVito
[0:19:40] <jnaynnay> No one can control Kramer
[0:19:40] <%KENTASHIRO> 1st episode they bought N Pass Premium
[0:19:43] <Mr_Strut> God bless danny
[0:19:43] <%starotter70> Isn't the 2nd episode about picking up girls at an abortion rally?
[0:19:45] <%Hobojo153> Wait Frank is season 2?
[0:19:47] <@commanderclaw> Paige needs ORB in her life
[0:19:47] <coldinnovation> Danny DeVito is amazing

[0:19:50] <JZPotter> @February_Croft Pepe Silvia
[0:19:51] <l33tc4k3> really? curb is good but i find it more cringe tbh
[0:19:52] <%kawajenarts> The "Flowers for Charlie" episode is the best
[0:19:54] <%TalisKanju> I found the bike Mac
[0:19:54] <%ElenaManetta> Fun fact: the gang never met danny devito before they started recording. they weren't sure how he was going to react to the script
[0:19:54] <%Hobojo153> I thought he was like episode 5
[0:19:55] <DrakanAroh> yeah frank starts in s2
[0:20:00] <%Dementedpenguin> Danny Devito is a treasure. Fight me.

[0:39:47] <%starotter70> The 3rd Testicle
[0:39:47] <%Rain_Mage> The Gamer Pouch
[0:39:47] <Dragovus> THE ORB!
[0:39:49] <$DensityD> balls of steel
[0:39:49] <jerobees> The balls are stored in the tummy
[0:39:49] <Alseid> This is the rare occasion that Pat is RIGHT
[0:39:50] <cureneckbeard> hehehe the orb
[0:39:50] <%Hobojo153> The orb is actually an omni ball
[0:39:51] <Klefth> He's a giant tanuki
[0:39:52] <+klassikFrank> Pat, stop mistake-shaming
[0:39:52] <%j0ustar> Pat is as cumorb

[0:39:55] <topendbuzza> PLAY THE ORB
[0:39:57] <Silent_Fyraena> RUB THE CRYSTAL ORB!
[0:40:00] <%ElenaManetta> if you dont know about safe sex you dont know about 9/11 this is a direct correlation
[0:40:02] <$DensityD> virtual reality
[0:40:03] <Monkeyweed21> VR would kill Paige
[0:40:04] <SMuffinMan> I will NOT disregard!
[0:40:05] <%deafmutelaughing> PSVR is vastly inferior
[0:40:05] <Silent_Fyraena> Orb of wisdom :)
[0:40:06] <%QueequegTheater> She would literally die on stream
[0:40:06] <%Hobojo153> Also Oculus Quest is like $300 I think
[0:40:06] <%ringabal> THE ORB REQUIRES MASSAGE
[0:40:07] <topendbuzza> eww vr
[0:40:07] <Neo_Kaiser> A teacher once said that her kids though 9/11 was a meme.
[0:40:08] <mr_mushie> oh
[0:40:08] <%maenos2> i feel like paige would trip and break her neck with VR
[0:40:09] <Zaphire_Saucypants> I'd like to see it.

[0:40:11] <%kawajenarts> the man with hot takes is over there fiddlin' with his junk

[0:40:15] <@PinkieTheEerie> VR CHAT GOOD TIME
[0:40:16] <%rumtumtugnutz> Oculus Quest doesn't need sensors!
[0:40:16] <+D00msDayDan> the only thing vr is good for is porn
[0:40:18] <$DensityD> don't do full setup, just get it
[0:40:21] <jowi_time> GET the QUEST!!
[0:40:21] <ExpressNode> Pay should just turn into a Snorlax
[0:40:23] <%ringabal> Pat would play as the birb
[0:40:24] <%ssjklyco> He may be playing with his belly/balls, he still didn't have a kid before he was 18
[0:40:26] <+VaudeVille_Villain_> It was never worth all the hoops I needed to jump through
[0:40:26] <Zaphire_Saucypants> but I'd worry about you accidentally killing yourself
[0:40:27] <$ShoMibu> So the lazy eye syndrom.

[0:40:31] <%ElkRiverDog> ShowLove100 ShowLove100 Hiya Paige! I meant to give this to you during Pat’s FF7 play through, but his (understandable) donation limit and my schedule since then stopped me. This is to celebrate the fact that we both said “Backstreets back, alright!” at the same time.

[0:43:22] <YakumoYomi> @j0ustar That's correct. It uses inside-out tracking and is completely standalone (save for needing a smartphone app to set it up), but you can connect it to a PC as a substitute for a Vive/Rift/Index with a proper cable.
[0:43:26] <$ShoMibu> We need a strip club for disable girls and guys, just 1 leg or wheel chair tricks
[0:43:28] <jowi_time> She was a
[0:43:29] <$DensityD> I wanted to have weird kinky intimacy with the hook hand doctor

[0:43:35] <jowi_time> She was a dentist
[0:43:36] <%ssjklyco> Turn it to glue
[0:43:39] <+OwlLightningMage> People forget that the train you suplex is also a ghost
[0:43:44] <%tinyswampthing> eat the horse
[0:43:46] <%nofestu2> wha5?
[0:43:47] <appletumtum> Horses will not show you the same mercy

[0:43:54] <%Totally_not_toby> EAT THE HORSE YEAH
[0:43:56] <$ShoMibu> Pat would say piss on it.
[0:43:57] <Mr_Strut> She understands now!
[0:43:58] <%sharpington_> Paige what have you done
[0:43:59] <assfordayz> Good lawyer
[0:43:59] <%starotter70> That sounds like something you'd say
[0:44:00] <$Sphincter_Spelunker> @DXLelouch24 to be fair, I lived by High School and was clean shaven at the time
[0:44:13] <%seycheles> sipsipSipsipblind sipsipSipsipblind sipsipSipsipblind
[0:44:20] <%aishman> @Jrocy247 No, FF4 came here as FF2. We skipped 2 and 3.

[0:44:48] <cureneckbeard> bolth
[0:44:50] <%j0ustar> @YakumoYomi Wasn't 100% if it was. We need to tell Pat since he still thinks VR costs like $1000 to set up but the Quest is like $400-600 and it needs only itself
[0:44:50] <topendbuzza> noooo
[0:44:51] <%Hobojo153> @Jrocy247 They never localized FF2, 3, and 5 originally
[0:44:54] <lotharrio> FF6: You suplex a train, trap a guilt-ghost in another dimension, climb a tower to steal some jewelry, see the horrible results of trans-species NTR, walk around in mech armor a few times, and get to hear a dog murder everything.
[0:44:57] <Sunstalker> WHO'S TOOTING? kinamaGasp

[1:09:22] <DrakanAroh> but the last two are rough iirc
[1:09:29] <zombie_goasts> Writing down facts does help improve the likelihood of recalling said facts

[2:43:42] <%spiritofmojave> fairly long
[2:43:43] <%oda_flobunaga> 50 hours

[2:43:47] <person181> LONG
[2:43:47] <hzealot> @PeachSaliva do we ever plan to get more than one day of gameplay / stream?
[2:43:49] <jowi_time> nice
[2:43:49] <%deafmutelaughing> another 2 hours, maybe 3
[2:43:51] <+blaflegume> Until it is done
[2:43:51] <katocrimson> still need to investigate
[2:43:51] <%oda_flobunaga> 410 Billion hours
[2:43:54] <%chiazamformerlymankeyfigh> Yeah stop here
[2:43:55] <+JacknZack27> If you’re tired you should stop
[2:44:01] <%RileyOMalley> I just noticed Elmos feet omg
[2:44:04] <+Walopoh> You should stop here tbh
[2:44:07] <Silent_Fyraena> @PeachSaliva There's another day of investigation (today) and another court day.
[2:44:10] <DXLelouch24> damn chat your slow, its not 2-3 hrs more
[2:44:11] <Zaphire_Saucypants> save again
[2:44:11] <%DesuDesuDokiDoki> uwu
[2:44:12] <%ringabal> SAVE AGAIN
[2:44:12] <Luna_selenic> I think I can finally remember this one, if I'm right it was dumb as fuck
[2:44:12] <@SoFarFetched> @hzealot Monday's for now of Ace Attorney
[2:44:13] <Zaphire_Saucypants> always save
[2:44:13] <hzealot> save again
[2:44:15] <+Grayhammatter> maya is basically paige
[2:44:15] <$DensityD> makes my heart go dokidoki
[2:44:15] <%Ynkubus18> yep
[2:44:17] <+desfore> Y
[2:44:18] <$Sphincter_Spelunker> "just got done sleeping, boy I can't wait to sleep more!" - Paige
[2:44:19] <%cherrycottontail> Just keep going for a bit Paige, or you'll turn this into another like 2-3 streams.
[2:44:29] <MasterDecoder> Always save, never stop saving
[2:44:33] <%cherrycottontail> It's totally 2-3 hours you haven't even met half the characters in this case yet
[2:44:39] <%worldbrand> bear in mind that this will be slower than a normal playthrough because paige is speaking every line
[2:44:40] <hzealot> @PeachSaliva golden rule of saving: Save over and over until you literally alt F4 post save
[2:44:46] <$DensityD> don't sleep paige, do yoga and then enter a calm meditative state
[2:44:54] <%GohanHitsugaya> Yay, magic.
[2:45:02] <%maenos2> all pat's fault gotcha
[2:45:03] <jowi_time> I was wondering what happened
[2:45:07] <%oda_flobunaga> @PeachSaliva, if you would consider playing more speech/reading heavy games in the future, please consider Planescape Torment. The first NPC party member you meet is a floating skull named Morte, voiced by Rob Paulson i.e. Pinkey from Pinkey N' the Brain. Morte is also the shortest character in the game so... sipsipGasm
[2:45:09] <$DensityD> don't blame the boys, they are good boys
[2:45:12] <DXLelouch24> just stream from the kitchen via a laptop
[2:45:13] <%spiritofmojave> tru
[2:45:14] <Zaphire_Saucypants> You'll probably finish the case next stream.
[2:45:14] <jowi_time> I thought you were supposed to start at 5
[2:45:14] <%DesuDesuDokiDoki> sleeping is fun, so is breathing and eating
[2:45:16] <Virokwet> lol
[2:45:16] <jowi_time> and llol
[2:45:18] <+Walopoh> Pat has it coming

[2:45:33] <%deafmutelaughing> everything's pat's fault
[2:45:34] <Arek_1> @DXLelouch24 Not sure what you were implying. You know that small cats are, like, 95% similar in DNA (and in stomachs) to big cats? What, do you ever see a tiger eating corn?
