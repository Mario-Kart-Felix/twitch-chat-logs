[0:13:16] <+PipIV> spilling at every angle
[0:13:16] <+Sackroad> Big Thongs for Big Dongs.

[0:13:21] <doctorferdinand> B all sa c
[0:13:22] <+irziggo> the balls get crushed
[0:13:23] <ECRead> @PeachSaliva it's fine

[0:13:24] <%JyrzRM> You just don't sit
[0:13:24] <element_of_loyalty> BESIDE THE SEAT
[0:13:24] <%CJett92> on either side of the seat
[0:13:24] <Divryne> Very carefully.
[0:13:25] <+badchoice5> Yes
[0:13:26] <+Tyonidus> no in front
[0:13:26] <%MrBorisMakarov> they just chill
[0:13:27] <AncelDeLambert> you never sit ON the balls
[0:13:27] <AtlasMcCoy> @PeachSaliva It's fine
[0:13:27] <+Virokwet> no one sits on thier balls
[0:13:28] <$MagickBurritoh> THE BALLS RETRACT
[0:13:29] <+badchoice5> They sit in front
[0:13:31] <%TenderBabyBacon> Frontish and kind of to the side
[0:13:31] <eldrich_horror> never sit on the balls
[0:13:32] <Arclight2879> Does it split the sack at the seem!
[0:13:33] <crimsonharvest> The balls sit flush on the seat just in front of your 'sit bone'
[0:13:34] <Caidezes> The balls schlorp.
[0:13:34] <Mr_LupLup> We just kinda let the balls hang
[0:13:35] <Laironx3> Balls go UP
[0:13:35] <+TsunamiPoro> I tuck when I get in drag
[0:13:36] <%HyperCharge_Sam> If you wear Spandex, it has built in padding
[0:13:37] <doctorferdinand> Bawlz
[0:13:38] <+PipIV> WE'RE NOT SITTING ON THEM
[0:13:38] <%velemi> They sit in front
[0:13:39] <Weeabooninja> They shlorp back up
[0:13:39] <%Tarviti> The balls go in
[0:13:40] <Admiral_PopnFresh> yes, paige, they are essentially infront
[0:13:40] <@MelBrooksKA> The package is very flexible
[0:13:40] <element_of_loyalty> Tail bone takes the job not the nuts
[0:13:40] <%Djinnazz> Hello today!

[0:13:43] <ECRead> @AtlasMcCoy doodBro
[0:13:44] <%generalve> elmo is sleeping
[0:13:46] <admiralsatan> your legs are spread
[0:13:46] <elshadow7> I think the reason you struggle with Portal so much is because you waste all of your smarts pondering these issues...
[0:13:46] <Carman2017> dont read this comment
[0:13:46] <rytisone> ITS JUST THERE
[0:13:48] <AncelDeLambert> this is an odd conversation
[0:13:50] <$MagickBurritoh> butt go down balls go up
[0:13:50] <+Skatedeandre> You have to re adjust yourself before you go
[0:13:51] <+badchoice5> Have you never seen a man retract their genitals Paige?
[0:13:51] <$BioStormX> The balls aren't being squeezed it's more like they just rest there while the pressure is on your ass
[0:13:53] <$Fenlig> Ya gotta tuck them into your poop hole!
[0:13:53] <vectorcannonready> It's like a squirrel in a crwn royale bag.
[0:13:54] <kumokalt> If you have big balls don’t use it
[0:13:54] <RoryDeuEx> Idk, I never rode a bike
[0:13:54] <alrobot2014> we don't sit on the dick shaped part of the bike
[0:13:55] <element_of_loyalty> BALLS?
[0:13:57] <%Djinnazz> Paige Tucks
[0:13:57] <laserbeaming> The Ball Triangle
[0:13:58] <CatmanIX> ideally it just works out and you don't have to think about it
[0:13:58] <Piejumper5814> loving the stream today
[0:13:59] <Admiral_PopnFresh> @Carman2017 sorry
[0:13:59] <Ropcord> 🤔 🤔 🤔
[0:14:00] <energywarning> it's not
[0:14:00] <$TootPirate> starUguu starPeach starUguu Yay a stream!
[0:14:00] <%HyperCharge_Sam> if you wear the Spandex, you got PADDING
[0:14:01] <C_S_N_G> They go in the ball compartment of your body
[0:14:01] <ooblagis> Your balls are cradled by your underwear, so they don't make direct contact
[0:14:02] <+ThePayphone> well if the top half wasnt there they'd just hang
[0:14:02] <+wolfeman1911> This is kinda like asking 'How do girls ride bikes? Does the seat go into you?'
[0:14:02] <%BodegaCat_> YOU JUST PUT THE BALLS IN THE BASKET
[0:14:02] <%velemi> FUTA
[0:14:03] <+PipIV> IT'S not
[0:14:03] <bananagourmet> it isn't
[0:14:03] <+zeliksisboss> its not
[0:14:04] <RollCritFail> You thought it was for legs, but it was for balls
[0:14:05] <element_of_loyalty> TheIlluminati
[0:14:06] <%swordsman70> It's not
[0:14:06] <%MrBorisMakarov> its not
[0:14:07] <$Chichen> ITS NOT
[0:14:07] <42nfl19> Well apparently male and female bike seats are different
[0:14:07] <DracaenaLeaf> depends on the seat
[0:14:09] <RoryDeuEx> Its odd, Paige
[0:14:10] <mercado94> is not
[0:14:10] <%SulfurousAcid> it's not
[0:14:11] <TheAzureGamer> It's not confortable, that's how
[0:14:11] <+TsunamiPoro> Tucking is important for crossdressing
[0:14:11] <RoryDeuEx> :o
[0:14:12] <person181> you don't really feel it
[0:14:12] <thelonechris> Pee is stored in the balls
[0:14:12] <Fujiwara_92> CAN WE LEAVE THIS CONVERSATION WutFace

[0:14:13] <AncelDeLambert> LULLUL
[0:14:13] <zaptar13> it's not
[0:14:14] <DracaenaLeaf> there are seat cushions for bikes
[0:14:15] <admiralsatan> protecc pee
[0:14:16] <Prism_Wing> The top half of the triangle is there because that's jow triangles work. Kappa
[0:14:16] <+oOZtkOo> NotLikeThis
[0:14:16] <mercado94> wtf paige
[0:14:18] <$lutefiiisk> Beacuse we manspread so the balls can rest on the triangle
[0:14:18] <+Virokwet> even elmo is tired
[0:14:19] <sponsoredviewer910> don't want your pee bursting out while you bike
[0:14:19] <+Sackroad> The balls are flexible.
[0:14:20] <crimsonharvest> you sit on the 'sit bone' when riding a bike and honestly it makes your balls numb to rest on that bone
[0:14:20] <geekjacob> is this going to become the dry cumming conversation allover again
[0:14:21] <+LuckyChocobo> Who says it's comfortable?
[0:14:22] <PumaOfDarkness> It's not comfortable. It rather hurts sometimes.
[0:14:24] <VanLynx> @PeachSaliva balls move forward to where your thighs would be if you were sitting. also feels like sitting

[1:57:42] <+Louie_Salmon> Anatomy was super cool
[1:57:43] <Piejumper5814> ANATOMY IS GREAT
[1:57:43] <+cereal_box_conspiracy> Soma is legit good.
[1:57:43] <element_of_loyalty> SPOOKY
[1:57:43] <%Hilleltaco> In a really interesting way too

[1:57:46] <frozenottsel> did it, naow
[1:57:47] <Jayschroo> Anatomy was FUCKING NUTS
[1:57:48] <$Agami23> yes it is
[1:57:49] <californaya> Anatomy might actually be my favorite modern horror game
[1:57:50] <thelonechris> Scary as fuck
[1:57:50] <DracaenaLeaf> It's spooky but not much of a game
[1:57:50] <%commanderclaw> YEYEYE, ANATOMY
[1:57:52] <Worldbrand> That was one of the best games in that shitstorm
[1:57:52] <+MarshallLee67> holy fuck anatomy

[1:58:10] <Jayschroo> HERE SHE IS
[1:58:11] <%swordsman70> no...
[1:58:11] <Rellim80> Paige playing SOMA would be GREAT
[1:58:11] <Sphincter_Spelunker> Paige can be our Angle or our Devil
[1:58:11] <californaya> she's almost got it
[1:58:12] <cizal11> what ELSE can be here
[1:58:16] <AncelDeLambert> only your PORTALS
[1:58:18] <jordanj4444> I remember Pat being REALLY unsettled by that game lol
[1:58:18] <%Remery_> SOMA isn't scary the weird lady gives you a boner
[1:58:18] <Graxe_> So which Stand in Jojo is basically a Portal Gun?
[1:58:18] <rytisone> but how?
[1:58:19] <californaya> the gears are turning
[1:58:19] <joblessbone> what stuff
[1:58:19] <%CJett92> how do portal?
[1:58:20] <$nitronLVIII> HOW
[1:58:20] <ricksaintriot> More Goo Is Needed
[1:58:22] <Graxe_> I forget.
[1:58:24] <Cheapheatmo> I played it after the shitstorm episode knowing what would happen and it still scared the shit out of me
[1:58:24] <crimsonharvest> SOMA oh god its full of GOO
[1:58:24] <ricksaintriot> you must spawn more goo
[1:58:25] <+BoboDaHobo> she figured out what the portals do
[1:58:27] <Cpt_phantom> Investigation, now we're sciencing
[1:58:29] <+Louie_Salmon> It's crazy how good anatomy is even though it's just a house and a bunch of dialogue

[1:58:37] <cizal11> why not
[1:58:37] <ricksaintriot> You Must Construct Additional Portals
[1:58:40] <VritraReiRei> Isn't that the one with the FEAR CORNER where they spent a good portion of the game ontop of a table in the corner of the kitchen? LUL
[1:58:40] <+ArcLifth> made out of energy
[1:58:41] <%CJett92> "oooooooooooh" she didnt solve it
[1:58:41] <AncelDeLambert> @peachsaliva gels don't go away when you go through the fields
[1:58:43] <element_of_loyalty> STOP THINKING N JUST DO IT
[1:58:44] <$nitronLVIII> if only she had a portal gun
[1:58:45] <%Sinister_Aglet> I love soma but I don't know if she should do a long story game
[1:58:45] <crimsonharvest> if only there was a device
[1:58:45] <%Remery_> SOMA and it's weird buthole locks
[1:58:46] <cizal11> use your words you're streaming
[1:58:51] <Dragon_Batman> don't goo to the portal
[1:58:52] <+JoeStillLife> putter longer
[1:58:52] <ricksaintriot> More Goo Depots Required
[1:58:53] <%mostundesired> I looked away for two seconds, what happened?
[1:58:53] <$Agami23> ???
[1:58:54] <californaya> no thinking. only portals.
[1:58:54] <Cpt_phantom> Atta girl Paige
[1:58:55] <+badchoice5> Ok Paige, here's a trick that helped me on this level. Think about how you would solve the puzzle if you had magic portals, then do that
[1:58:57] <element_of_loyalty> STOP TAKING
[1:58:58] <zal_silverfang> "what are you thinking about" "idk yet"
[1:59:02] <Bouldus> how can you think youre wrong if you dont know waht youre thinking?
[1:59:05] <%LordMoonIV> @Remery_ SOMA had the best butthole locks
[1:59:05] <Endocrom> Wonder what that box is up to...
[1:59:06] <mercado94> welp later im gonna watch that KingdomHearts 3 stream
[1:59:07] <californaya> YOU'RE ALMOST THERE

[1:59:17] <ECRead> Unlimited Goo Works
[1:59:18] <ricksaintriot> how can portals be real if our eyes aren't real.. good at seeing
[1:59:18] <%CJett92> TURN AROUND
[1:59:20] <element_of_loyalty> Peach talks to hides her lack of thinking.
[1:59:21] <CatmanIX> LOOK BEHIND YOU
[1:59:22] <$dotta5> no need for goo anymore
[1:59:22] <sirbobos> After all these mental gymnastics Paige should chill with a simple game, like Little Inferno.

[1:59:34] <californaya> oh my goooooooooood
[1:59:36] <%Remery_> @LordMoonIV the weird part was when you put your arms it, it would tighten up and grab your arm
[1:59:41] <Piejumper5814> GOOD JOB

[1:59:44] <rytisone> reverse brain work
[1:59:46] <Dragon_Batman> It's too simple that she is overthinking it
[1:59:47] <%legendfather_of_giants> do you even need the goo at all?
[1:59:48] <crimsonharvest> looooook
[1:59:48] <Dr_mr_wang> she's not thinking of the solution
[1:59:50] <crimsonharvest> LOOK WITH YOUR EYES

[2:08:06] <$dotta5> Well, the spelling is different
[2:08:07] <+TaifuDragon> @PeachSaliva mostly north america, but tornadoes have been seen everywhere besides antarctica
[2:08:08] <%LordMoonIV> 222222
[2:08:09] <%Yukihiyou> Monsoon is the name for the wind pattern, like El Nino
[2:08:10] <+JoeStillLife> LUL
[2:08:11] <%legendfather_of_giants> yes, but monsoons typically come with hurricanes
[2:08:11] <Semiconductive> you are the big smart

[2:08:12] <ricksaintriot> @demonhunter790 may i see it?
[2:08:15] <+TaifuDragon> Like vast majorityt
[2:08:15] <Logan_Jennings1> They happen everywhere but Antartica
[2:08:17] <+JoeStillLife> Chicago takes all the wind
[2:08:17] <element_of_loyalty> white
[2:08:19] <%Tarviti> Only difference is which ocean they start in
[2:08:23] <CrimsonCore90> America has the patent for wind
[2:08:24] <sosuke5> Monsoon is a wind of destruction
[2:08:24] <jack_s1n> Australia has cyclones
[2:08:25] <%CJett92> Has she forgotten about the white gel?
[2:08:26] <demonhunter790> @ricksaintriot no
[2:08:27] <+Blargimazombie> And that's why America in the most oppressed country
[2:08:28] <%TheFilth> typhoons = hurricane
[2:08:30] <+cereal_box_conspiracy> There's tornados in other country, but America is a huge tornado hotspot.
[2:08:30] <shurtal> Wind doesn't blow in America, Canada just sucks. BOOM
[2:08:30] <AthenaAegis> Hurricanes are localized imports Kappa
[2:08:31] <+Ssaik> Paige what are you doing
[2:08:31] <+badchoice5> Only the Winds of FREEDOM blow hard enough to make tornados
[2:08:32] <element_of_loyalty> THE GAS
[2:08:33] <EuropantLamprey> None
[2:08:34] <CatmanIX> Cyclone = Typhoon = Hurricane
[2:08:34] <AncelDeLambert> typhoon I think is either the SEASON or the direction of spin
[2:08:34] <XdaXcaptainX> america is the tornado champion
[2:08:34] <Endocrom> Pacific ocean
[2:08:34] <rytisone> what about fire tornados from disaster: day of crisis?
[2:08:35] <turf_wind_and_fire> Paige. Don’t do what I think you’re gonna do.
[2:08:35] <st_jimmy456> literally what ocean they're in
[2:08:36] <zamzoph> which ocean
[2:08:37] <ECRead> it depends on wind currents and elevations
[2:08:38] <$Agami23> the location
[2:08:38] <Worldbrand> hahaha
[2:08:38] <gyrogogozeppeli> the spellingh
[2:08:39] <Who_lio42> amount of water
[2:08:39] <$wolfofsound> @PeachSaliva Other locations that experience frequent tornado occurrences include northern Europe, western Asia, Bangladesh, Japan, Australia, New Zealand, China, South Africa, and Argentina. In fact, the United Kingdom has more tornadoes, relative to its land area, than any other country.
[2:08:40] <+BoboDaHobo> water
[2:08:44] <ricksaintriot> It's technically possible to have a tornado anywhere. NA has lots.
[2:08:45] <CptBritches> It's just where they form

[2:17:43] <JDebss> I wanted a spit-take
[2:17:44] <MoulesFritz> Dr Pepper in herantly inferior to Dr Pibb
[2:17:44] <CptBritches> Dr. Pepper is in every store that carries soda
[2:17:44] <%LordMoonIV> if only you could jump into the beam
[2:17:45] <%Mekhet09> it's awful.
[2:17:45] <+Dovakhin573> Yeah Dr Pepper is US thing mostly

[2:17:50] <moonsaber99> Dr pepper is bad
[2:17:50] <element_of_loyalty> SHE'S STUCK
[2:17:51] <%HyperCharge_Sam> It's not a super sweet soda, but I enjoy it
[2:17:52] <+Tylermcd93> Dr Pepper is okay.
[2:17:52] <+Sponsored_Subscriber> I've never had any of the coke or Pepsi like drinks
[2:17:54] <+Silversunburst> Is Pat Being Wrong Again?
[2:17:56] <Arclight2879> Dr. Pepper is trash.
[2:17:57] <SandaSimpson> its black goop how would you know boivin!?
[2:17:57] <daveontheupside> Dr. Pepper is a false idol
[2:17:58] <Dr_mr_wang> fun fact: aluminum doesn't have a smell, it's the metal mixing with the oils of your hand that smells. this is true for other metal smells like copper or iron
[2:17:58] <%Tarviti> Dr. Pepper is big in the sex criminal fanbase
[2:18:00] <%NigelSchnauzerpug> @demonhunter790 You're a monster
[2:18:00] <side_effect> oddly, Diet Dr. Pepper isn't bad, but regular Dr. Pepper is like cough syrup
[2:18:01] <Cheapheatmo> where do you want it to go??
[2:18:01] <deviljhojho94> MEXICAN COKE FOREVER
[2:18:03] <AncelDeLambert> Pat is being wrong again
[2:18:04] <+AmaniIsYourBoss> Dr Pepper is the Death Note of sodas.
[2:18:05] <cizal11> paige for god's sakes
[2:18:06] <Worldbrand> I started out hating Dr Pepper, so i know it's not for everyone
[2:18:07] <daveontheupside> There is only BARQ's
[2:18:07] <JDebss> @landmaster37 tastes like it
[2:18:08] <quickflames> Pibb is superior tho
[2:18:08] <%MightyMaxT> Is it a grate?
[2:18:08] <sirbobos> Yeah Pat, Paige tricked you. Dr. Pepper is is lie. You actually drank motor oil. Ha!

[2:18:47] <%LordMoonIV> AHHHHH
[2:18:48] <grayjammer> AAAH
[2:18:51] <Coystick> Oh no is she still in the SAME room?
[2:18:54] <ProRJHunter> AAAH
[2:19:02] <+Tylermcd93> That being said, Dr Pepper is super acidic so it's not for everyone
[2:19:04] <+Sponsored_Subscriber> Oh no not this one
[2:19:04] <element_of_loyalty> global warming - Canada's fault
[2:19:04] <EASrake> That's cause the earth hates how free we are
[2:19:05] <DapperHatwell> I haven't had DP in years. Lost a taste for it.
[2:19:07] <daveontheupside> Only $30 to SEE MOLECULES???
[2:19:07] <$dotta5> Dr pepper is what they put into the lethal injections
[2:19:09] <ricksaintriot> Dr. Pepper sued Coca Cola for making a soda called "Peppo"
[2:19:09] <Logan_Jennings1> Thanks CANADA
[2:19:10] <+badchoice5> YEAH! AMERICA FUCK YEAH!
[2:19:10] <%MightyMaxT> I grew up in Minnesota and never saw a Tornado
[2:19:12] <riantDeliration> this is like the roughest chamber in the whole game, it takes some time
[2:19:13] <DirtyDeedsDunDirtCheap> SCIENCE
[2:19:16] <+Roundelay11> We essentially live in a tornado chamber

[2:19:31] <ricksaintriot> they had to change it, so they changed it to "Dr. Pibb" which was still too close
[2:19:32] <%NWR_James> Dr. Pepper tastes like poson
[2:19:35] <%GohanEgret> LUL
[2:19:36] <%LordMoonIV> Canada being nice is just a cover for their sinister Tornado production
[2:19:38] <Coystick> USA tornados in that one area are op
[2:19:38] <rytisone> Dr Pepper is produced the same way as Virility in DmC
[2:19:42] <KilljoyHexx> B I G G O O
[2:19:43] <thelonechris> The entire Earth can be a tornado chamber if the conditions are right
[2:19:45] <$BioStormX> the most effective poisons taste good

[2:20:43] <Captainahab_37> What’s up you dorks
[2:20:44] <ricksaintriot> "It also does not contain extracts of the cola nut, which makes it not a cola."
[2:20:45] <KilljoyHexx> I actually cant stand dr pepper I think it tastes like bad cough syrup
[2:20:47] <%Ciphris> it's not the worst she just needs to time it

[2:25:30] <element_of_loyalty> HOKN
[2:25:32] <+badchoice5> Just a reminder to everyone that Paige CHOSE this, she did it to herself
[2:25:33] <TheIronBrass> GOD YOU'RE RIGHT THERE
[2:25:33] <danknugglit> Dont cross the dicks
[2:25:34] <Gash_Plague> Why is Paige's first instinct always to spew her goo everywhere?

[2:25:57] <%Ciphris> this is actually the worst i thought she would figure it out faster
[2:25:58] <crimsonharvest> you ahve so much time and you dont need to move
[2:26:02] <rytisone> just needed to press the button
[2:26:03] <EuropantLamprey> Pat, get a fire extinguisher, I can see smoke pouring out of Paige's ears

[2:26:12] <%SuperCasualBoom> cheer200 I heard Pat’s favorite movie recently was Jordan Peele’s directed horror “Get Gout”. Haha corny jokes all night. Anyway, Pat I won’t give you shit about the Dr. Pepper. I’m not going to judge you because everybody has have different tastes, just that everyone who enjoys a Dr. Pepper are way better people in life. At least you didn’t drink a Moxie. That carbonated drink is complete shit in a can.

[2:26:35] <twitcherview1> it makes perfect sense
[2:26:36] <Dr_mr_wang> it's the worst because the test is hard

[2:34:34] <$SparkAfterDark> Pat you are going to need to manually open her eyes and then remind her to keep them open every few seconds.
[2:34:34] <KilljoyHexx> Dr pepper sucks, Pat is right
[2:34:34] <%Remery_> Dr.Pepper taste like a flat cherry coke
[2:34:35] <+badchoice5> Yeah, I could only watch the intro, but I'm excited for DMC2
[2:34:36] <umbracatalyst> PAT HAS SHIT TASTE
[2:34:36] <ricksaintriot> every soda tastes better with cane sugar.
[2:34:36] <alrobot2014> do you remember, 22nd night of September, portals changing the minds of pretenders
[2:34:36] <AncelDeLambert> What's the deal with ANY soda, you baby boy?
[2:34:36] <+tigerfang86> totally great vid
[2:34:36] <rhus> DMC2 WAS SO GOOD
[2:34:37] <rudybrossard> Pat, your thoughts on Telttall closing
[2:34:38] <+AmaniIsYourBoss> I enjoyed the DMC2 lovers 'tears
[2:34:39] <sirbobos> FIX YOUR TONGUE PAT! It's broke!
[2:34:39] <$Sphincter_Spelunker> Richter the D is the true not coward
[2:34:40] <ashenonec> COWARD!! NO BALLS
[2:34:41] <danknugglit> I liked the part with the gun
[2:34:42] <CatmanIX> your taste buds are just wrong pat, but it's ok, you can't be blamed for your genetic deficiencies
[2:34:43] <zal_silverfang> @PeachSaliva It's kinda meant to be a cola by with like a after fruity taste instead of just tasting like outright cola sludge
[2:34:43] <Huntercd> You are just wrong Pat
[2:34:43] <MoulesFritz> @PeachSaliva you did exactly as much DMC2 as I wanted
[2:34:44] <%HyperCharge_Sam> It's more savory and less sweet, so if you're the kind of person who only eats tendies and cheese pizza, it's not for you
[2:34:44] <KiroKadura> YEEAH Play it COWARDS
[2:34:45] <%imextremelymanly> DMC 2 the best DMC
[2:34:46] <+SolidusRex> I just joined in, I thought Paige would be a LOT further than this considering the point where she started.
[2:34:47] <Dr_mr_wang> when's talos principal 100%?
[2:34:48] <topendbuzz> WITNESS ME
[2:34:49] <EuropantLamprey> DR PEPPER FOR LIFE
[2:34:49] <Rellim80> Coward
[2:34:50] <Coystick> Y is DMC2 so bulllied?
[2:34:50] <element_of_loyalty> WOOLIE IS GETTING MARIED
[2:34:50] <cizal11> is she crying in the bathroom
[2:34:52] <+Hinasil> Pat insults my lineage, my family has loved Dr Pepper since it's inception
[2:34:53] <RipSlamsteak> the slow fade fucking killed me
[2:34:53] <+aversal_ammar> DMC2 can eat my whole ass
[2:34:55] <%LordMoonIV> Dr Pepper is like mixing every drink available at the push fountains at Fast Food places
[2:34:56] <+Grayhammatter> play it you COWARDS
[2:34:57] <%SuperCasualBoom> Fuck Moxie
[2:34:58] <Makoiscutest> Play witness
[2:34:58] <Laironx3> (?) Billy will remember that
[2:34:59] <+PipIV> it's just a good soda from my state
[2:35:01] <%ssjklyco> @PeachSaliva Dr. Pepper is essentially advertised as a NON Cola Cola drink. People will either like it or hate it.
[2:35:01] <cherubsanonymous> It was so perfect
[2:35:01] <+tigerfang86> the transition was beautiful
[2:35:01] <Gash_Plague> Woolie and Billy are interchangeable
[2:35:02] <+Griffin1171> Because Billy loves DMC2
[2:35:06] <Intolerable> @PeachSaliva Dr. Pepper is an acquired taste.
[2:35:07] <KilljoyHexx> I stand with pat on this Dr Pepper Hill
[2:35:07] <rytisone> But the Infested Helicopter
[2:35:07] <element_of_loyalty> yes
[2:35:07] <ricksaintriot> @SolidusRex that is, as the kids say "where you're wrong kid-o"
[2:35:10] <guyman125> You should do DMC2 for the end of shitstorm because it is so bad it is scary
[2:35:10] <MoulesFritz> @PeachSaliva you did exactly as much DMC2 as I wanted.
[2:35:11] <troxcree> Yeah but when's DmC?
[2:35:12] <%Toynota10> so that means dmc4 right?
[2:35:12] <AMajorTom> I haven't seen it yet, did you just spoil me?
[2:35:14] <danknugglit> BIG GOOD LAUGHS
[2:35:15] <Darren716> Are you going to re-title it?

[2:35:25] <%salty_syd913> to me
[2:35:26] <%NigelSchnauzerpug> You're bad/ You Canadian.

[2:35:32] <$FoxInABeret> "I hate you and all the bands you like."
[2:35:32] <%AbnormalVoid> Dr. Pepper is so bad
[2:35:33] <ProRJHunter> I liked it then grew to hate it

[2:35:43] <AvailDreams> taste is subjective
[2:35:44] <ricksaintriot> RedBull tastes like gasoline
[2:35:44] <Tooniearcade> Yeee doctor pepper suxxxx
[2:35:45] <%imextremelymanly> that stinger was limp as fuck
[2:35:45] <%HyperCharge_Sam> DMC2 LOOKED WAY WORSE THAN I THOUGHT
[2:35:45] <AncelDeLambert> You literally didn't even TASTE IT
[2:35:47] <element_of_loyalty> FOODS HERE
[2:35:48] <+Griffin1171> the stumblin' stinger
[2:35:49] <%smargh1015> you guys going to do any RDR2 stuff on the channel
[2:35:51] <$Fenlig> Pat did you get your 2080, the benchmarks make them look like trash!
[2:35:51] <cherubsanonymous> DMC2 isn't actually Billy's favorite, but it turns out his opinion for liking it is even worse than we thought.
[2:35:51] <matrignomy7> I got so hype during the transition to 3.
[2:35:56] <+Doctor_Stew> Dr. Pepper is like the undertale of Sodas
[2:35:57] <%Toynota10> nice ringtone
[2:35:57] <%Sinister_Aglet> *guy who chugs medicine flavored soda* this cherry stuff is bad
[2:35:57] <Kyle4sod> IT'S REALISTIC
[2:35:58] <ne0bunny> is DMC2's story important to know for DMC5?
[2:35:59] <rytisone> Trish gameplay is the best part of that game
[2:35:59] <$nitronLVIII> apatBig COWARDS zoneRage
[2:36:00] <Gerik1233> Its fine. Now Pepsi that's terrible.
[2:36:03] <+Grayhammatter> DMC2 looks like GARBAGE compared to one
[2:36:03] <+Griffin1171> now but Billy loves DMC2, tho
[2:36:03] <%ssjklyco> I passed a controller to a friend and he recoiled when he hit the stinger button
[2:36:03] <Paralurx> Is the DMC2 thing a case of shattered glass, unshattered glass, or glass being shattered and then glued back together?
[2:36:04] <cizal11> it's the worst stinger i've ever seen
