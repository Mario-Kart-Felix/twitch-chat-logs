You can encourage swallowing by one of three methods; gently rubbing your cat's throat, blowing in your cat's nose, or have a syringe of water ready to go, and dribbling it into the side of your cat's mouth immediately after placing the pill. Pill Poppers."?

[0:55:09] <Perky_EDF> Xenogears is great. Though it and FF8 woulda been better if they didn't have to split development.
[0:55:13] <Laironx3> I want to see Matt & Woolie play KH and lose their shit when they see the FF cameos.
[0:55:13] <%Metballs> So...that Portal, eh?
[0:55:14] <$brave_sj> That sounds like an anime gag

[1:10:41] <mayorrev> pc_master_race.mp4
[1:10:41] <hntronium> Controller actively handicaps you Paige
[1:10:42] <Mr_Strut> Because a mouse is more precise for shooters
[1:10:44] <Hydrapissed> controler for portal is fine but most fps mouse aiming is better
[1:10:44] <+RafflesiaA> That old aperture logo is very nice
[1:10:44] <+TsunamiPoro> oh shit

[1:10:57] <+Youwereeatenbyalid> Controller for FPS is considered garbage
[1:11:00] <+MarshallLee67> because kb+m is objectively better for first person games
[1:11:03] <mostundesired> How fucking precise do you need to be for god damn Portal? DansGame
[1:11:04] <%mistersokar> Just use what's comfortable for you, even if controller is wrong
[1:11:05] <vonmaultke> PC ELITE pvpHonor MUH MOUSE IS BETTER
[1:11:05] <+JoeStillLife> I play primarily on PC and use a controller 90% of the time
[1:11:10] <%Spirit_hz> Drum controller is the real meta
[1:11:10] <corepool> oh this one might defeat her
[1:11:11] <Gruhunchously> Put science in me and make me live and strong and big now.
[1:11:12] <mayorrev> ohh man i love this puzzle
[1:11:13] <digital_pinp> Keyboard is best for everything especially fighters
[1:11:14] <+Youwereeatenbyalid> but probably not relevant outside of competative
[1:11:15] <%dirtyh4rr1> oof, this one
[1:11:16] <Hydrapissed> but this is also a puzzle game which requires zero aiming really soooo whooooo cares
[1:11:17] <%swordsman70> Oh this room
[1:11:17] <AthenaAegis> Eh, I vary between controller and KB&M depending on game
[1:11:17] <mayorrev> i remember this one vividly
[1:11:18] <%rdark_ksu> oh yea this long fucker
[1:11:18] <herush> i have to use controller or my wrists die
[1:11:19] <alwayspronking> buckle in!
[1:11:19] <$brave_sj> Because controllers are OBJECTIVELY worse for first person aiming why would you use the inferior method
[1:11:19] <+badchoice5> Why is Paige using her upgrade points
[1:11:21] <+tigerfang86> COMPLEX PUZZLES??????
[1:11:21] <mayorrev> its so fun

[1:11:53] <%galaxyswirl> 1
[1:11:54] <Fruitywhompus> x is good
[1:11:54] <+badchoice5> FF 10 is the best Final Fantasy
[1:11:55] <+TheImmortal70> It's goofy
[1:11:56] <Dire_Newt> i forgot spoony was a person
[1:11:57] <+Press_X_ToJASON> FFX is fiiiiiiine

[1:12:04] <$GohanEgret> 10 is great
[1:12:05] <AtlasMcCoy> teedus
[1:12:05] <Jaedon86> Once had a friend who thought he just sucked at fps games...turns out he was using a controller. Still give him shit about it.
[1:12:05] <TikanZK> even wakka????
[1:12:06] <$sylphyyyy> 8 is a good game aside from the draw syste,
[1:12:06] <@DreyfussFrost> 10 is great.
[1:12:06] <+tigerfang86> SUPPORT X
[1:12:06] <+HiroTSK5> X is my favorite version of classic turn-based battles
[1:12:07] <+ThatGuyfromMars> @Gouf_Troop he's bananas but he used to be incredibly funny
[1:12:07] <+BoboDaHobo> 10 is fun if you like walking down hallways
[1:12:07] <SuperNotSuspiciousMan> X is fine except for the voiceacting

[1:12:09] <$joylent_blue> Tidus fucking sucks but everyne else makes up for it
[1:12:09] <+RafflesiaA> 10's pretty alright
[1:12:10] <SleepyPB> X is fine, XIII is ok but its ruined because of its sequels
[1:12:10] <+DynamiteLPs> Pat Is Wrong? who knew
[1:12:10] <+tigerfang86> FURRY
[1:12:12] <Dire_Newt> his ff8 series was decent
[1:12:12] <ScallyCapt> knowing Paige shes going to Beautiful Mind this puzzle while later forgetting how to press buttons for 30 minutes
[1:12:12] <ape_hawk> tidus is MEANT to be a loser, tho

[1:12:14] <+badchoice5> Best music, best battle system
[1:12:14] <Hydrapissed> 8 and 13 are ULTRA OMEGA TRASH
[1:12:14] <Gruhunchously> Spoony, like a lot of creative types, has some deep seated issues.
[1:12:14] <+Press_X_ToJASON> as someone who doesnt like final fantasy, X is fiiiiiiine
[1:12:16] <aeonicvector> @PeachSaliva But 8s great, just play the actual game, and leave the RPG alone

[1:12:24] <$Chichen> Paige are you in furry denial
[1:12:24] <deviljhojho94> Waka is best
[1:12:26] <Firesparks> tidus is a loser in the beginning but he turn great near the end
[1:12:27] <+TsunamiPoro> Snow is the only good character in 13
[1:12:28] <mercado94> Of course
[1:12:29] <Ninjagregory98> It’s good if you ignore the fact that none of it makes any sense
[1:12:29] <$superorangerobin> Bitches don't know about my junctions
[1:12:32] <$FoxInABeret> "I'm wrong about a lot of stuff, but I'm not wrong about that" --Guy who says that about everything people tell him he's wrong about it.
[1:12:34] <zal_silverfang> she accidentally did it
[1:12:36] <b1gboss007> Of corse she likes the furr
[1:12:38] <%NWR_James> Did she just ask Whats hippity-happening?
[1:12:42] <TheBlankAce> Holy shit Pat Ono just got fired from Capcom's fighting game division.
[1:12:42] <+Press_X_ToJASON> @hero1151 he's dead to US
[1:12:42] <+RafflesiaA> @TsunamiPoro What about Sazh
[1:12:45] <vonmaultke> Like FF12? Jebaited everyone but the 2 kids they forced in for marketing is great
[1:12:48] <%GMAN_SECTOR> FF9 is the best you nerds
[1:12:50] <$joylent_blue> spoony is only dead by internet standards, he's still alive
[1:12:53] <%SulfurousAcid> what @TheBlankAce
[1:12:55] <Luesagna00> @peachsaliva most ppl hates how FFX is linear or they dont like the characters, or both
[1:12:55] <%CJett92> She's learning!
[1:12:56] <rhus> @TsunamiPoro why would you do my boy Sazh like that
[1:13:01] <%TheOnlyStrayCat> cheer500 He’s pointed a gun at me once. Albeit a broken and unloaded gun, but nonetheless. (a .22 revolver that was broken is a rare sight indeed, honestly). And it was his drunk ass being upset that I wouldn’t get off the couch after working all day. This was also several years ago, but the boy is just SLIGHTLY unhinged.
[1:13:07] <Gruhunchously> Isn't Pat's whole thing is that he's literally wrong about everything, especially when he thinks is right.
[1:13:10] <TheMilhouseExperience> She accidently solved the most of it.
[1:13:13] <+TsunamiPoro> Sazh is just annoying dont @ me

Cause there are some people who are just broken from the outset. Also, lets you test how they handle alcohol for a few years. Find out if they’re gonna punch Grandma out, you know?

[2:12:30] <CatmanIX> personality cores~
[2:12:31] <+TheImmortal70> It implies there are other portal substances
[2:12:31] <ProRJHunter> 1
[2:12:32] <admiralsatan> Didn't the Combine come to steal portal tech?
[2:12:32] <+Clik404> Pat you wrong
[2:12:33] <arcaderabbit48> No, pretty sure its confirmed that the core itself corrupts the personality modules

[2:12:39] <+anarachnid> yes that is correct pat
[2:12:40] <+BoboDaHobo> yeah they just made a portal gun and then waited for years to figure out how to use it
[2:12:42] <AtlasMcCoy> The goo is made out of portal
[2:12:42] <gyrogogozeppeli> my goo is made out of moon rocks
[2:12:43] <%SulfurousAcid> the goo is made out of portal
[2:12:43] <Gruhunchously> Pat is wrong, more at eleven
[2:12:43] <deviljhojho94> Patricio Wrongboivin
[2:12:44] <Mr_Strut> The goo is made out of portals!
[2:12:44] <mostundesired> I like the idea that they had so much moon goo they just used it to paint the walls. LUL
[2:12:44] <Fujiwara_92> GOO IS MADE OUTTA PORTAL
[2:12:50] <+Bupkis7> Pat is super wrong
[2:12:50] <%SuperCasualBoom> You know what’s in 1950s? Racism
[2:12:52] <herush> moon dust is just a really good portal conductor but it works on other things
[2:12:53] <CatmanIX> no he's super right
[2:12:53] <%SchroedingersFerret> That's a trait common to all supercomputers. My college's penguin cluster was a HUGE bitch.
[2:12:54] <+linSP> if pat ever admits he's wrong, crazy talk makes him not wrong
[2:12:54] <+RafflesiaA> Goo is moon rocks, that one is right
[2:12:55] <$Mendin> mint is just cold spicy in space
[2:12:56] <%GeneralSCPatton> It was all chronological order. They already had portal experiments. The moon goo was just the best conductor.
[2:12:57] <%SulfurousAcid> I picked up Spoder yesterday
[2:12:57] <+Youwereeatenbyalid> OK THANK GOD HE SAW IT AND I DON'T NEED TO DONATE BITS TO POINT OUT HOW WRONG YOU ARE

[3:05:37] <%GeneralSCPatton> I think that last one should be "Does the set of all sets that don't contain themselves contain itself?"
[3:05:42] <+walternatorz> every "no" is just another "oh" in a supercut.

[3:06:23] <tonfirean> To be fair, the last one is related to Russell's paradox in that typically the way we "resolve" Russel's paradox is to not talk about "the set of all sets" in the first place. Because the alternative is hamstringing or rejecting the axiom of comprehension and that's no fun.

[3:18:02] <+GuelermeDias> paige would have a brilliant career as a games journalist OR a tester, considering IGN and SBFP's level of videogame skill
[3:18:02] <EASrake> That's not the reason
[3:18:02] <Gruhunchously> CUTE GIRLS MIGHT BE WATCHING THIS STREAM, LAUGHING AT YOU!
[3:18:03] <Donchalant402> thats not why she cant help you
[3:18:05] <arcaderabbit48> @Mittensbro This game is about a lot of things, but that is one of them. Plus how power corrupts people, and the fucked up gender dynamic in work places can lead to idiots being in charge, and so on.
[3:18:07] <$awsomesaucekirby> cheer232 hey guys, i just got off work an hour late because no-came to get me when my shift was up. Free overtime i guess. My biggest issue with this supermarket is the bathroom has a sign saying "even if in a rush, please remember to flush" if the sign is gonna rhyme, give it some cadence for god's sake
[3:18:09] <GarrisonArmory> Thats not the reason Pat
[3:18:09] <sosuke5> That's not the only rason
[3:18:09] <+Youwereeatenbyalid> there's another reason
[3:18:19] <grayjammer> She was shorting out because she was thinking too emotionally about stuff.
[3:18:22] <%doc_ock_rokc> Hey I just remembered I bought beer the week before last
[3:18:22] <Snaketsu> is pat wrong again
[3:18:25] <%SuperCasualBoom> Elmo lost 2 of his 9 lives watching Paige puzzle quest
[3:18:29] <$brave_sj> Pat that's wrong but still probably partially true
[3:18:34] <VritraReiRei> @Mittensbro no, GLaDOS became numb to the testing, she just made test bercause it was fun. Wheatley just became Evil because he got mad with power
[3:18:39] <BeansAreFunnyhaha> it's important to examine your entire environment before attempting a solution
[3:18:40] <Donchalant402> thinking hard doesnt short her out, emotional outbursts do
[3:18:45] <+Mittensbro> @arcaderabbit48 The power one is obvious, but I don't see the gender dynamic thing
[3:18:46] <Laironx3> But it's as dinamite as a dinamite with a laser beam?
[3:18:48] <knomad2b> portal 2 still has some of the funniest comedy in any game iv'e played imo

[3:20:19] <Laironx3> The oposite of sanity
[3:20:19] <arcaderabbit48> @Mittensbro Wheatley is the stereotypical "idiot that things he could run the place but totally could not." Cave Johnson is somewhat similiar in that he's charismatic to get to the top, but ran his company in to the ground by killing people, buying moon rocks, and doing absolutely nothing what the miracles of science they actually made. Meanwhile, its implied Caroline was the one who was actually keeping the company from completely imploding in on itself.
