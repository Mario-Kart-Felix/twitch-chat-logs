[0:07:40] <+edibleskeleton> did pat grow from an egg?
[0:08:03] <+Dova573> Man my stats distribution is all over the place
[0:08:04] <~PeachSaliva> @edibleskeleton WHO TOLD YOU
[0:08:23] <+edibleskeleton> I knew it
[0:08:41] <udurbalanced> Pat confirmed for Digitamamon
[0:09:01] <+edibleskeleton> Pat confirmed loves mpreg
[0:09:23] <$trackles_64> is this a new intro?
[0:09:44] <plumsocks> what is mpreg
[0:09:54] <+YourRedDog> There has always been a Pat, but only one at a time. One emerges from their forest home in the Canadian Outback each generation to choose their successor. It's a little known fact that the Rumpelstiltsken story was based on Pat.
[0:10:21] <+edibleskeleton> male pregnancy
[0:10:23] <$trackles_64> Muffins are cakes tho
[0:10:46] <plumsocks> oh, who's pat's baby daddy
[0:10:48] <%SMuffinMan> What's a cake now? Kappa
[0:11:05] <$trackles_64> muffin is a small cake
[0:11:20] <%Ranryu692> I dunno about cakes and muffins, but an open-faced sandwich is not a sandwich
[0:11:27] <%SMuffinMan> Cake cake cake cake cake
[0:11:29] <$trackles_64> Hot dog is a sandwhich
[0:11:52] <$trackles_64> So is a burger
[0:11:59] <%Ranryu692> hell yeah they are
[0:12:16] <Zeif00> carlsPToss carlsPToss carlsPToss
[0:12:22] <udurbalanced> An open-faced sandwich is top heavy toast
[0:12:33] <+YourRedDog> Ok, so what I'm getting is if Muffin is Cake, and Hot Dog equals sammich, then Sammich divided by the hypotenuse of Cake equals Pi.
[0:12:39] <$trackles_64> A desconstructed sandwhich is just flour
[0:12:46] <%Ranryu692> an open-faced sandwich is a sandwich you haven't finished making yet
[0:12:59] <udurbalanced> Sandwich with the top down, if you will
[0:13:10] <ohno58> Muffins are indeed cakes

[0:35:08] <%MooseIsGoose> he is summoned in the fight
[0:35:08] <udurbalanced> Is it more or less funny that my ex was 47?
[0:35:11] <TurtlesAndTentacles> I didn't think you'd be streaming  today
[0:35:21] <%MooseIsGoose> he fucks the dude up
[0:35:36] <%cade_calrayn> We can tell you which one if you want, Blaidd can be summoned
[0:35:46] <%Sotetsu> I was refreshing Twitter looking for the stream announcement. fmgS
[0:36:06] <sirrice77> OH you got here?
[0:36:09] <MaybeFalco> YEYEYE
[0:36:14] <%greasypete00> yo this tower fucks
[0:36:14] <+DovaDude29> i got invaded by the 'No Maidens' man. feels bad NotLikeThis NotLikeThis
[0:36:15] <+blastyoboots> WHAT
[0:36:20] <edibleskeleton> Darksydephil has been getting his ass kicked
[0:36:20] <+blastyoboots> THERE'S A LADDER?!?!??!
[0:36:21] <+Mekhet09> THE INSIDE IS WORSE
[0:36:22] <%pinkslimegoblin> holy shit
[0:36:23] <sirrice77> Okay but have you gone down the inside yet?
[0:36:24] <Baljhet> that area's like soul level 100 btw
[0:36:30] <%greasypete00> you can farm here pretty well too
[0:36:34] <+adamisbarely3d> that's a dark souls
[0:36:36] <+wizard_of_diamonds> See that tower? You can climb it Kappa
[0:36:38] <nip_nips> i just fought the boss inside that tower, it will murder paige so hard
[0:36:44] <%VentWilsn> thought it was a bean Kappa
[0:36:46] <udurbalanced> Big dick livin
[0:36:47] <+KazairLux> big heart dong
[0:36:47] <rudiciuscaesar> dick shaped heart?

[0:37:06] <$ErikFeral> Dingdom Hearts, Chain of Dingalings
[0:37:11] <PlaidisTheNewPlaid> I thought the ding-dong you have in your heart was wolf shaped?
[0:37:12] <+blastyoboots> oh that's a *different* tower
[0:37:13] <+adamisbarely3d> climbing around on a ledge smaller than your character is the dark soulsest
[0:37:14] <tentavision> patches confirmed
[0:37:18] <+MartinOfLoxley> You meeting patches was the best
[0:37:25] <Spydurman> oh man you've really explored the fucked up area
[0:37:29] <+Felhad> Those skeletons rule
[0:37:36] <$ErikFeral> Nice, SkeletonQueen Build!
[0:37:42] <%AncelDeLambert> maaaaan I wanna say something but I also do not want to backseat
[0:37:43] <$ErikFeral> BigStrong
[0:37:46] <Spydurman> hell ya
[0:38:02] <rudiciuscaesar> arcane, what is this, Bloodborne.
[0:38:03] <TurtlesAndTentacles> does it?
[0:38:12] <%AncelDeLambert> did you use the stonekey in the skeleton lake?
[0:38:13] <nip_nips> whoever said it softcaps at 27 is wrong
[0:38:30] <+Felhad> she said 30
[0:38:34] <MaybeFalco> ive been told the new soft-cap is 60, and there's definitely some weapons/spells with high requirements
[0:38:36] <nip_nips> 30 is also wrong
[0:38:36] <+vaporousTippler> Uh, I don't want to give anyone false hope, but I fixed my stutter.
[0:38:38] <%AncelDeLambert> yes
[0:38:50] <nip_nips> ive raised it to 50 and still get big jumps every level
[0:38:59] <$ErikFeral> ... must avoid joke of 7 Intelligence...
[0:39:04] <RyuuAoi> I made itM
[0:39:08] <$ErikFeral> jokes aside, good build
[0:39:11] <%TheotherKristian> Welp, ya boy just lost 13,000 souls while playing Elden Ring in Stornveil
[0:39:12] <%MooseIsGoose> so if you go to the forlorn hound evergol it will let you summon the hot wolf man
[0:39:15] <%holydeviant1> 30 is a good place to hit requirements, though!
[0:39:17] <RyuuAoi> Did she just start?
[0:39:20] <+Felhad> psaBig ironmouseBRAVE
[0:39:21] <edibleskeleton> some spells need 52 intelligence
[0:39:22] <udurbalanced> Horse
[0:39:28] <nip_nips> one spell needs 70 intelligence LUL
[0:39:31] <+Felhad> one spell needs 70 int
[0:39:33] <+Felhad> lol
[0:39:33] <rudiciuscaesar> @RyuuAoi she's little over a half hour in I believe.
[0:39:36] <+KazairLux> I thought 40 was the soft cap for strength
[0:39:42] <TurtlesAndTentacles> you  aren't dumb
[0:39:52] <RyuuAoi> Peach, where are you? Ghost Peach tonight?
[0:39:56] <rudiciuscaesar> Karon?
[0:39:57] <rudiciuscaesar> Charon?
[0:40:01] <rudiciuscaesar> Charon
[0:40:01] <+MartinOfLoxley> Cairn
[0:40:02] <Cherokia666> Charon
[0:40:04] <Baljhet> psychopomp?
[0:40:04] <tentavision> charon
[0:40:04] <udurbalanced> Charon
[0:40:07] <nip_nips> karen of the river styx
[0:40:07] <RyuuAoi> @rudiciuscaesar No shenanigans at the start?
[0:40:08] <+YourRedDog> Charon
[0:40:11] <Maids4lyfe> Ferryman
[0:40:11] <+Felhad> Karen
[0:40:17] <ohno58> a aron
[0:40:18] <Spydurman> Kai-ron
[0:40:18] <PlaidisTheNewPlaid> Cairn?
[0:40:20] <udurbalanced> Kayr-on
[0:40:23] <TurtlesAndTentacles> Kai ron
[0:40:28] <+barrakuta371> A-A-ron
[0:40:29] <RyuuAoi> The little boy?
[0:40:30] <$ErikFeral> Karen, the Ferryman of Managers
[0:40:30] <+YourRedDog> I'm replacing Karen memes with Charon from here on out, though.
[0:40:31] <toahmes> They call it a mariner in game
[0:40:35] <+PatchTheSquid> Charon
[0:40:35] <rudiciuscaesar> yeah, it's pronounced like Ka-ron, I think. Since CH in Greek is a hard K sound.
[0:40:39] <+PatchTheSquid> The Ferryman
[0:40:39] <Baljhet> that one's good
[0:40:42] <$ErikFeral> Charon is the proper spelling
[0:40:43] <+Ne1son> I say use it you'll get more
[0:40:43] <%AncelDeLambert> you want what's in there if you're physical
[0:40:44] <RyuuAoi> Johhny Apple Seed?
[0:40:45] <Cherokia666> I know this one. Want to know the item?
[0:40:54] <%holydeviant1> there's a lot of places to get keys, don't worry overmuch
[0:40:57] <RyuuAoi> The racist little kid?
[0:40:58] <rudiciuscaesar> @RyuuAoi you missed Elmo screwing with Mustard Mama's controller.
[0:41:00] <%cade_calrayn> You get plenty through playing
[0:41:12] <RyuuAoi> @rudiciuscaesar F U C K
[0:41:18] <TurtlesAndTentacles> You called?
[0:41:18] <rudiciuscaesar> aiya! Daguiiiii
[0:41:20] <MoonObscure> D| O G

[0:41:37] <rudiciuscaesar> RAD
[0:41:41] <%VictorVonLouche> kill them all for their neck meat
[0:41:42] <MoonObscure> :D
[0:41:47] <tentavision> OH SHIT BEST ITEM
[0:41:47] <rudiciuscaesar> makes you like pizza?
[0:41:47] <Baljhet> makes you more turtle-y
[0:41:48] <ohno58> I'm pretty sure there are no mimics in this game
[0:42:02] <%SveriSageAdvice> i have never taken that talisman off yet, its too good lol
[0:42:05] <nip_nips> @ohno58 thats just what they want you to think monkaS
[0:42:06] <$ErikFeral> my mom has a collection of turtle memorabilia, since it was a hobby when she worked as a teacher
[0:42:20] <GhostPyre> that's useful for any build. magic uses stamina too
[0:42:27] <+Mekhet09> I'm playing level 1 no maiden. It's getting super hard.
[0:42:27] <jackalias> @ohno58 Knowing From Software there's exactly 1, just to keep you on your toes
[0:42:39] <rudiciuscaesar> can the player character swim in this game or only Torrent?
[0:42:42] <%atarifreak7> @Baljhet but is it turtle-y enough for  the turtle club?
[0:42:52] <tentavision> nope no swim
[0:42:54] <rudiciuscaesar> I would imagine you'd drown with the armor lol.
[0:42:54] <Baljhet> @rudiciuscaesar no swimming, all water deeper than ankle is instant death
[0:42:56] <%AncelDeLambert> nope, only wade
[0:42:59] <%greasypete00> no you sink like a metal ball
[0:42:59] <Maids4lyfe> water is death
[0:43:17] <rudiciuscaesar> awwww, really? That's a shame. Wish they changed that. Unless Tarnished canonically cannot swim lol.
[0:43:25] <rudiciuscaesar> like how the Hollows didn't have a shadow in DS3
[0:44:00] <SulfurousAcid> look at these fucking creatures
[0:44:08] <Parapattern> Imagine if there was some super obscure quest that gave you the ability to swim and it turns out there's an entire underwater map as big as the world map
[0:44:12] <rudiciuscaesar> you summoned the Jelly Fish for this one
[0:44:14] <+I4gotmyname89> I4gotmyname89 subscribed with Prime. They've subscribed for 28 months! 
[0:44:25] <rudiciuscaesar> who is a bad ass summon.
[0:44:48] <%cade_calrayn> Yup you’re heading the right way :)
[0:44:48] <MaybeFalco> jellyfish is a pretty good summon, it's very tanky
[0:44:56] <rudiciuscaesar> still not used to that jump lmao
[0:45:19] <SulfurousAcid> you get crazy stamina in this game
[0:45:24] <cartakus> This is still first part of limgrave right?
[0:45:34] <rudiciuscaesar> is that the moon?
[0:45:36] <rudiciuscaesar> oh wait, tree
[0:45:41] <%Tornadobear> sipsipElmo sipsipElmo sipsipElmo
[0:45:51] <rudiciuscaesar> oh and moon
[0:46:01] <SulfurousAcid> moon confirmed
[0:46:08] <+MartinOfLoxley> That's a big moon
[0:46:10] <MoonObscure> this game for reals is damn amazing..
[0:46:13] <MaybeFalco> that moon is very close
[0:46:17] <+wizard_of_diamonds> Big moon for big girls
[0:46:22] <SulfurousAcid> dawn of the first day
[0:46:25] <AdmiralButtloaf> where theres a moon theres a moon presance

[0:46:38] <+blastyoboots> @PeachSaliva have you tried Pocket Knives, ie crafting cheap Throwing Knives and keeping them on a Pouch shortcut so you can hit Y + D-pad button for an instant ranged attack?  Check out how strong it is because it SCALES with your Str and Dex
[0:47:07] <%AncelDeLambert> this place is safe
[0:47:17] <+blastyoboots> got it
[0:47:19] <cartakus> master dragon...he dead
[0:47:22] <AdmiralButtloaf> make contact?
[0:47:25] <+ReallyBigRocks> i'm 35 hours in and still haven't crafted anything
[0:47:26] <+ZephynM> Hope this play goes well. My game just stopped reading all forms of input and thoroughly infuriated me when I just wanna explore.
[0:47:28] <Strigiform> Dragon incantation build is now available
[0:47:29] <+Mekhet09> You can do that now it'll only take you like 2 minutes to see.
[0:47:39] <Baljhet> honestly I put all three potions plus Torrent on my pouch slots
[0:47:50] <%cade_calrayn> Wanna go kill some dragons, Paige?
[0:47:50] <rudiciuscaesar> what a majestic creature
[0:47:51] <SulfurousAcid> angy jelly
[0:48:18] <rudiciuscaesar> woah, squirrel raccoons
[0:48:19] <+wizard_of_diamonds> There's something about floating, moonlit jellyfish that I love
[0:48:24] <AdmiralButtloaf> dafuq?
[0:48:25] <Baljhet> penguins...but they can fly
[0:48:25] <rudiciuscaesar> no not the birbs

[0:48:36] <@SoFarFetched> note to self, Never hang out with paige when she has a sword geefBlinds
[0:48:37] <nip_nips> wont kill turtle but happily murder penguin

[0:48:40] <leaplearning> facecam
[0:48:40] <+fromnibelheim> :((((
[0:48:40] <+MartinOfLoxley> Sadge
[0:48:40] <udurbalanced> I love this environment. It's beautiful and desolate.
[0:48:40] <SulfurousAcid> no killing only applies to turtle guys
[0:48:42] <MoonObscure> lol
[0:48:42] <@SoFarFetched> she'd kill me
[0:48:46] <%AncelDeLambert> look, you need FEET, they have to die!
[0:48:49] <ohno58> Those birds were women
[0:48:52] <rudiciuscaesar> they must have all been female....
[0:49:06] <%cade_calrayn> Scarabs, yeah
[0:49:08] <%AncelDeLambert> huh, there's stone scarabs...
[0:49:24] <%holydeviant1> Also since Pots scale with your attack stats, you should always make a few and keep them on hand.
[0:49:29] <+PesterChunklage> you know the game would be ten times better if i could just summon a lil mike wazowski
[0:49:42] <%AncelDeLambert> oddly yeah
[0:49:48] <TurtlesAndTentacles> Paige why do you keep calling me
[0:49:50] <TurtlesAndTentacles> I kid
[0:49:52] <+blastyoboots> agreed
[0:49:56] <%AncelDeLambert> even more so than DS1, yeah
[0:49:58] <Baljhet> I love the overworld a whole lot. I don't have a good time on bosses.
[0:50:06] <jackalias> That's like saying poorest billionaire
[0:50:10] <MaybeFalco> its very calm until you walk into a field boss you didn't know was there
[0:50:14] <cartakus> on my way to kill the second of the main bosses...I think?
[0:50:14] <+ReallyBigRocks> being able to fuck off and do something else instead of bashing your head into a wall is awesome
[0:50:18] <%AncelDeLambert> the ability to just pinball off a problem really eases the tension
[0:50:31] <+Mekhet09> I disagree because a lot of the bosses feel poorly designed. They belong in bloodborne but you don't have bloodborne's mobility.
[0:50:46] <%AncelDeLambert> Paige, have you completed any of the Gaols? That shield guy reks my ass
[0:50:52] <Parapattern> I don't get everyone's problem with the difficulty in these games. Just level up until it's easy like every RPG.
[0:50:52] <ohno58> Yeah that's how i feel about the bosses
[0:50:57] <+Mekhet09> They get agroo.
[0:51:00] <+PesterChunklage> just like real life i get to avoid all my problems
[0:51:02] <%cade_calrayn> Yeah the island is just the dragon church
[0:51:10] <%greasypete00> Margit is a brick wall for many players
[0:51:12] <%AncelDeLambert> I disagree. I don't even roll out of Margit's knives, I just step side-to-side
[0:51:16] <cartakus> The bosses feel fast but have a small moveset to learn
[0:51:20] <senfood> Oh hey, extra runes night!
[0:51:23] <%pinkslimegoblin> peach is merciful in her strength
[0:51:29] <Baljhet> Good luck!
[0:51:34] <rudiciuscaesar> Stomp him, Paige.
[0:51:38] <anAngryHamster> I don't think Miyazaki has had any new ideas after Bloodborne
[0:51:42] <+ReallyBigRocks> I think you're a high enough level to beat his ass
[0:51:44] <%AncelDeLambert> how have you not beaten Margit and have THAT MUCH of the map above him filled in?
[0:51:51] <+imthewisejanitor> Stomp 'em in the nuts
[0:51:51] <rudiciuscaesar> @anAngryHamster I kinda agree...
[0:52:00] <%AncelDeLambert> or are you gonna get summoned, I'm confused
[0:52:01] <@SoFarFetched> @AncelDeLambert avoiding responsibilites Kappa
[0:52:06] <ohno58> She's pretty strong right now though. She can do it.
[0:52:17] <%pinkslimegoblin> I wonder what a minimum bosses run of this game would look like
[0:52:17] <%AncelDeLambert> I beat Margit before finding that shackle, fecking feck
[0:52:20] <+kewlmyc> Sure
[0:52:21] <Baljhet> I mean, you can completely fill in Limgrave, Caelid, and Liurnia before fighting any boss.
[0:52:22] <@SoFarFetched> fuck it

[0:52:24] <@SoFarFetched> do it

[0:53:03] <%DiscoMatador> Npc summons are a must
[0:53:10] <%AncelDeLambert> oh no she's bottoming out her stamina still
[0:53:16] <Ictiam> alot of the bosses that feel really unfair at first are more often than not parryable. like they really want to reward the good Sekiro players lol
[0:53:18] <%AncelDeLambert> DANG
[0:53:22] <cartakus> So easy
[0:53:23] <ohno58> She's fuckin him up

[0:53:51] <+MarkoTolstov> is it just me, or is Margit's VA very Fourchenault?
[0:54:00] <%AncelDeLambert> oh man I hate that sword

[0:55:55] <@SoFarFetched> all good
[0:55:56] <+blastyoboots> @PeachSaliva "Margit’s Shackle is priced a whopping 5,000 Runes. It can only be used in the first phase, and no more than twice in the fight. You can slot it into your quick item belt or pouch. Once activated, it will incapacitate him for about three seconds each time, giving you a chance to land a hit or two risk-free."
[0:56:01] <rudiciuscaesar> good volume now
[0:56:15] <+Kro_Raptor> I love drugs.
[0:56:39] <+NopeBadguy> SKELETON WARRIORS

[0:57:08] <rudiciuscaesar> man, that motion Margit makes when he tosses the little golden magic dagger to the ground, that's a good movement.
[0:57:09] <Baljhet> all these high-grade bosses have attacks designed to catch you if you roll immediately.
[0:57:10] <Broand> The boney bois...

[0:58:13] <stevenellis386> that something you should of used right when your about to beat the guy
[0:58:15] <+PesterChunklage> i think wolves keep him distracted longer
[0:58:16] <cartakus> F
[0:58:18] <%JoshManVGH> There's an NPC summon sign right outside Margets door on the right if you want a third buddy.
[0:58:23] <+ReallyBigRocks> that was good tho
[0:58:24] <rudiciuscaesar> still got him super far down though
[0:58:27] <Broand> Oh you're getting those sporadic slowdowns too?

[1:10:21] <RyuuAoi> Angriest Peach
[1:10:25] <Giztech> OWL2019gg
[1:10:26] <+Mekhet09> @PeachSaliva I don't know if you know this but margit delays attacks. So do most bosses to stop roll spam.
[1:10:28] <nip_nips> FIRST TRY!
[1:10:33] <%Fuggins4U> that jellyfish is a TANK
[1:10:34] <Profmcstevie> You'll remember this TARNISHED DIIIIIICK
[1:10:36] <TurtlesAndTentacles> 10th
[1:10:37] <An_Aimless_Avocado> Woe he has alot to say for someone who died and disintegrated
[1:10:41] <+imthewisejanitor> Yay murder! <3
[1:10:42] <MaybeFalco> look at that fat stack of runes
[1:10:55] <EASrake> its prevalent
[1:11:00] <cartakus> panic rolls leads to death
[1:11:03] <Profmcstevie> Nice mouse
[1:11:05] <MaybeFalco> mouse on screen
[1:11:07] <Spydurman> the game can't handle how much you just kicked its ass
[1:11:08] <BigFingerRo> @RyuuAoi That'd be an interesting change of gimmicks, PatSaliva and Angriest Peach
[1:11:11] <+kewlmyc> Is your controller dead?
[1:11:14] <+PesterChunklage> Now you begin your journey in elden ring
[1:11:16] <%Dakuu75> Panik... Calm...
[1:11:17] <HotSauceFiend> MArgits new attack-kills controller
[1:11:21] <%Dementedpenguin> The game fears your strength. WutFace
[1:11:32] <Profmcstevie> Live nerfing of the Paige, controller kill
[1:11:33] <%Fuggins4U> i showed up at the right time
[1:11:35] <stevenellis386> feels nice
[1:11:38] <%Fuggins4U> for big victory
[1:11:49] <rudiciuscaesar> Pat Saliva would just involve chocolate oranges....
[1:11:51] <xxHungryxx> Crushing the early game, Godwick is nxt to get a wallop
[1:12:00] <%Fuggins4U> Bo for Groke
[1:12:01] <cartakus> STR?
[1:12:02] <rudiciuscaesar> cna't go wrong with more HP
[1:12:04] <Spydurman> what would Dex do?
[1:12:08] <%AncelDeLambert> it's true
[1:12:10] <+PesterChunklage> margit's lingering will is psychomantis level controller fuckery
[1:12:13] <ohno58> I found Godrick harder
[1:12:17] <Profmcstevie> Only a big strong handsome IDIOT would go pure STR......
[1:12:19] <nip_nips> i had more difficulty with godrick
[1:12:19] <+Mekhet09> It depends on  how you play.
[1:12:22] <xxHungryxx> The both are pretty tough imo
[1:12:23] <%cade_calrayn> @PeachSaliva you'll eventually have to up your Mind to give you enough FP for better summons, just something to keep in mind.
[1:12:26] <EASrake> There's some truth to that
[1:12:30] <%cade_calrayn> (no pun intended)
[1:12:33] <An_Aimless_Avocado> i thought godrick was way harder personally. but its probably depending on playstyle
[1:12:37] <rudiciuscaesar> HORSE STABILITY sounds good
[1:12:41] <%Fuggins4U> insert mind
[1:12:46] <rudiciuscaesar> "MY MIND!!" - Professor X
[1:12:47] <%AncelDeLambert> mental MIND powers!
[1:12:48] <%Fuggins4U> boost horse bond
[1:12:50] <%cade_calrayn> 100 FP is a good one to shoot for
[1:12:51] <Profmcstevie> MIND INCREASE, EMPTINESS
[1:12:53] <Spydurman> MY MIIIIIND
[1:12:54] <HotSauceFiend> you bring that IQ to double digits page
[1:12:56] <RyuuAoi> Smoke a blunt, Peach!
[1:12:57] <+imthewisejanitor> Inject mind
[1:13:01] <%AncelDeLambert> ME! AND KG! (that's me!)
[1:13:03] <Gorgs7> Mind bullets!
[1:13:15] <%Fuggins4U> that's telekinesis Kyle
[1:13:18] <xxHungryxx> Granted, I just stood back and cheesed both with Sorcery 😏
[1:13:21] <%AncelDeLambert> That's telekinesis, Kyle!
[1:13:22] <%cade_calrayn> that's what you need for Oleg, Pat's excellent stand
[1:13:37] <Savage_Howitzer> bigtun17 bigtun17 bigtun17 bigtun17 bigtun17 bigtun17 bigtun17
[1:13:39] <cartakus> Oleg is so cool
[1:13:43] <QueequegTheater> no
[1:13:43] <+notsoy> no
[1:13:46] <rudiciuscaesar> sounds casting only
[1:13:47] <+Mekhet09> I wouldn't bother.
[1:13:48] <Profmcstevie> Casting only
[1:13:53] <Spydurman> looks like casting onlu
[1:13:53] <+kewlmyc> Dex and Strength are different weapons
[1:13:55] <+notsoy> i don't think anything has ever affected your melee attack animations
[1:13:59] <Profmcstevie> You can use smarts with BIG SWING sadly
[1:13:59] <+PesterChunklage> MORE STRENGTH MAKE PEACH STRONG
[1:14:00] <rudiciuscaesar> would be cool if the soft and hard cap did increase the speed
[1:14:02] <+notsoy> outside of the weapon minimums
[1:14:06] <rudiciuscaesar> wait, would it increase the speed of drawing a bow?
[1:14:08] <Spydurman> go psaBig
[1:14:12] <An_Aimless_Avocado> wait dex increases cast speed???
[1:14:21] <+notsoy> that's what it says yes
[1:14:31] <Profmcstevie> Dex mages
[1:14:34] <+notsoy> ofc it might be another situation where it only increases it 5% or whatever
[1:14:40] <rudiciuscaesar> man, these roads are like Pittsburgh's roads....
[1:14:45] <An_Aimless_Avocado> gotcha
[1:14:48] <udurbalanced> Ebola soup, even

[1:21:37] <MaybeFalco> @rudiciuscaesar fall damage is pretty much non-existent. you either take a little bit of damage, or you die. otherwise there's pretty much none.
[1:21:39] <jackalias> (not) Pro tip: ballistas are excellent for hunting in this game
[1:21:43] <ScreamLord> Homocidal
[1:21:46] <RyuuAoi> Peach, do you like Clamato?
[1:21:48] <+ReefTheWizard> sliterally didnt know you could go here
[1:21:48] <%AncelDeLambert> Paige, now would be a great time to try a throwing knife
[1:21:48] <%Dakuu75> These birds have studied the blade
[1:22:02] <+Namillus> Sometimes fall damage hits your stamina instead of your health and I'm not sure what the requirement for that is
[1:22:03] <EASrake> these birds have no scruples
[1:22:09] <SulfurousAcid> bless
[1:22:12] <YakumoYomi> Bless you
[1:22:16] <rudiciuscaesar> @MaybeFalco lol then how come dex leveling lowers your fall damage? Is that a joke or does it make you like, invincible to falling eventually
[1:22:17] <+ReefTheWizard> weeabirds with katana feet
[1:22:32] <%cade_calrayn> Awww she didn't fight the birbs
[1:22:32] <+ReefTheWizard> touch grass
[1:22:38] <DanteReaver> dex must lower fall damage on horse
[1:22:44] <%AncelDeLambert> actually, they have a SHITTON of honor
[1:22:52] <+ReefTheWizard> all that armor, no guts
[1:22:53] <An_Aimless_Avocado> @peachsaliva you have to stand when examining those summon statues
[1:22:57] <cartakus> bird monster in this game are asshats
[1:22:59] <DanteReaver> cause when you receive fall DMG on horse you lose hp
[1:23:06] <Spydurman> Worf would get destroyed by the pots in this game
[1:23:06] <rudiciuscaesar> "man"
[1:23:08] <Baljhet> very far
[1:23:14] <heartlesshealer> maybe the framerate will make him fall
[1:23:18] <+anoldtoilet> he would see you if you were standing up
[1:23:19] <%cade_calrayn> he is a Toot-Toot man so beware
[1:23:21] <MaybeFalco> @rudiciuscaesar there's a ring that makes you immune to fall damage, and it didn't actually work for me at all. so if i were to guess the ring and the dex stat bonus probably don't work.
[1:23:30] <+MartinOfLoxley> he sees you
[1:23:33] <Frostydough1> WHOS TALKING
[1:23:34] <ALazo> LUL
[1:23:36] <heartlesshealer> controller WHY
[1:23:36] <Baljhet> ...perhaps we should turn more settings down
[1:23:37] <%greasypete00> this is very unfortunate for the stream
[1:23:39] <+wizard_of_diamonds> RIP
[1:23:40] <%CzeekyTV> what platform is paige on?
[1:23:42] <EASrake> you need to restart the game or something

[1:24:15] <XzileGaming> im starting to think Paige ahs stress induced tourettes syndrom
[1:24:16] <rudiciuscaesar> @MaybeFalco that sounds like a joke, like the pendant or whatever from DS1 being useless

[1:24:53] <lettersofsky> no thank you, i don't wanna exit the butthole
[1:24:54] <RyuuAoi> Cats chew wires too. Confirmed
[1:24:54] <Spydurman> what's the gift shop???
[1:24:55] <%Dakuu75> @PeachSaliva the cable's connection for the PS4 controllers are really bad. I use to have to replace them, too often
[1:24:58] <+notsoy> to be fair, zangief destroys many things
[1:25:03] <+imthewisejanitor> Did you just call your ass the gift shop?
[1:25:07] <rudiciuscaesar> sorryuh
[1:25:11] <$Fenlig> Is it an Xbox controller, my port is fucked. I just use the wireless for stability
[1:25:11] <ohno58> soria
[1:25:12] <EASrake> can you elaborate on the Lemony soup?
[1:25:14] <heartlesshealer> the gift shop is the appendix
[1:25:16] <nip_nips> this is pats fault somehow
[1:25:20] <An_Aimless_Avocado> hey paige make sure to stand when examining those summon statues. it doesnt work when you do it crouched.
[1:25:20] <%Zulrez> only hot french doctor is allowed in there?
[1:25:21] <+ReefTheWizard> @imthewisejanitor she did
[1:25:25] <MaybeFalco> @rudiciuscaesar probably, but the pc version is broken a little bit
[1:25:28] <%AncelDeLambert> "It's not my fault!" Exclaims Paige as she races off in the Millenium Falcon
[1:25:31] <cartakus> This is jellys fault
[1:25:33] <%Logoth_> Ppaaaaaaaattt~
[1:25:43] <RyuuAoi> Hi Andrew ha
[1:25:44] <rudiciuscaesar> @MaybeFalco oh yeah? That's a shame, PS5 is ok?
[1:25:56] <Spydurman> oof that fog effect is chugging
[1:26:00] <rudiciuscaesar> also not surprising. It seems every big game launch has some weird problem now
[1:26:08] <heartlesshealer> ps4 version running on ps5 I've heard is the better running one
[1:26:13] <+ReefTheWizard> >gaslighting yourself over soup
[1:26:50] <Spydurman> oh man the PC just hates this area, it's strugglinh
[1:26:58] <+cvp5127> is that her comp or the stream chugging?
[1:27:00] <+ReefTheWizard> lmaoooo
[1:27:04] <heartlesshealer> Paige, is there big stuttering on your end or is this just twitch being twitch?
[1:27:07] <rudiciuscaesar> Anor Londo fire archers?!

[1:27:15] <An_Aimless_Avocado> it wasnt nearly this stuttery for me on pc i have no idea why this is wild
[1:27:15] <$Fenlig> Its the port not the cable
[1:27:19] <heartlesshealer> NotLikeThis
[1:27:21] <jackalias> You moved a little at the end
[1:27:22] <jabroni_mike_official> paaatttt we need a new cable
[1:27:23] <$velgaduere> sounds like a port issue
[1:27:24] <udurbalanced> This is karma for beating scorpion man
[1:27:25] <+barrakuta371> monarchOver
[1:27:25] <%cade_calrayn> Sounds like a controller issue then
[1:27:27] <@Jekado> the true elden ring was ELMO psaPorgmo
[1:27:28] <Baljhet> another usb port?
[1:27:29] <+Nekros4442> is it the port?
[1:27:30] <MaybeFalco> try a different port for the controller
[1:27:31] <SulfurousAcid> try a different usb port
[1:27:32] <%TheotherKristian> plug it in?
[1:27:32] <@PatStaresAt> @PeachSaliva try a different USB port
[1:27:32] <cartakus> why is the game also freezing?
[1:27:33] <+yoscribe> that's definitely a controller issue
[1:27:33] <%AncelDeLambert> It's just one of those days. Like a chainsaw, skin yer ass raw
[1:27:35] <$Fenlig> Use the wireless
[1:27:36] <+polothegreatest> plagueCringe
[1:27:37] <@Jekado> ELMO RING
[1:27:39] <+notsoy> it's either a USB port problem or a game problem
[1:27:43] <DrGhostJelly> oh...mu series x controller does the same thing
[1:27:47] <$velgaduere> plug it into a different USB port
[1:27:47] <+Namillus> controller problem
[1:27:50] <+thesw1tch> plug it into a different port maybe
[1:27:50] <heartlesshealer> Could try putting it in a different USB slot
[1:27:50] <%VentWilsn> time to play with keyboard? lytWORRY
[1:27:51] <+ReefTheWizard> >not bluetooth connection
[1:27:51] <$Fenlig> Should have bluetooth
[1:27:52] <EASrake> This is an issue completely separate from the stuttering issues others are reporting
[1:27:54] <Broand> I mean you know when game freezes up for like second? The controller is dying right then.
[1:27:56] <SulfurousAcid> does your computer not have multiple usb ports?
[1:28:03] <%rumtumtugnutz> if its turning off then the controller is fucked
[1:28:04] <rudiciuscaesar> Elmo wrecked the controller for real?
[1:28:07] <+adamisbarely3d> miyazaki paid Elmo to keep paige from succeding because she is TOO STRONG
[1:28:09] <Spydurman> LUL
[1:28:17] <+JayCantDo> It might be draining the controller faster than the cable can charge it
[1:28:17] <MaybeFalco> if you have an extra ps5 controller, those work really well on pc
[1:28:19] <$rdark_ksu> physically fight the controller
[1:28:20] <RyuuAoi> Maybe it's the weed, Peach
[1:28:20] <%cade_calrayn> THE FORBIDDEN TOOT-TOOT
[1:28:21] <+blastyoboots> if it won't work wirelessly then what if it's a bad wire?
[1:28:24] <+ReallyBigRocks> get got by the tootsman

[1:28:26] <%Logoth_> psaHoldon psaHoldon psaHoldon psaHoldon psaHoldon psaHoldon
[1:28:39] <Broand> They just replaced the wire
[1:28:41] <rudiciuscaesar> oh God that sound gives me anxiety lmao
[1:28:42] <MaybeFalco> ba da doop
[1:28:46] <+thesw1tch> i would laugh so hard if for some reason dude runs off the ledge
[1:28:49] <+Axellogic> HELLO IT IS I! How goes the paige streams?
[1:28:51] <EASrake> *USB noises*
[1:28:57] <rudiciuscaesar> I always think that's my PC getting ready to die
[1:28:58] <udurbalanced> System noises intensify
[1:29:00] <$velgaduere> @ReefTheWizard never to be cleaned, kept to serve as a stark reminder of the carnage
[1:29:06] <+imthewisejanitor> Boopy doo
[1:29:25] <$velgaduere> @ReefTheWizard perpetually sparking and leaking black smoke
[1:29:27] <EASrake> It would probably be a good idea to just relaunch the game as well
[1:29:35] <Maids4lyfe> Pat sits on a low couch so when Elmo and Geif knock the controllers off they don't fall as far, so your controller probably hits the floor harder and breaks? Just a hunch
[1:29:41] <+adamisbarely3d> DO NOT TOOT
[1:29:51] <heartlesshealer> yay her controls are lasting longer <3
[1:29:56] <heartlesshealer> so probably port
[1:29:57] <$velgaduere> tootn't
[1:30:00] <%cade_calrayn> beware the forbidden toot-toot

[1:30:36] <Spydurman> man I hope they fix the PC port. This might be the first Souls game I wanna play
[1:30:37] <SulfurousAcid> game be having trouble

[1:30:46] <+Ez3z> rooms haunted
[1:30:46] <+Axellogic> Did you break more glasses?
[1:30:47] <+MartinOfLoxley> Paige is being haunted by Lincoln
[1:30:48] <+ReallyBigRocks> get down
[1:30:48] <Spydurman> Lincoln?
[1:30:50] <+Nekros4442> is it Lincoln?
[1:30:51] <+imthewisejanitor> Toot ghosts
[1:30:53] <An_Aimless_Avocado> its the ghost of abe Lincoln
[1:30:54] <SulfurousAcid> maybe try restarting the game
[1:30:57] <Maids4lyfe> lincoln's revenge
[1:30:58] <+adamisbarely3d> Even while streaming?
[1:31:01] <%CzeekyTV> is paige on PC?
[1:31:02] <+ReefTheWizard> i have no trouble and i beat the second legacy dungeon already
[1:31:03] <MaybeFalco> paige have you tried duct-taping everything down so it can't move?
[1:31:03] <RyuuAoi> Ghost Pat
[1:31:04] <+thesw1tch> @spydurman hope you have a great pc, cuz the port is bad and it's resource heavy
[1:31:04] <SulfurousAcid> maybe the server disconnect messed it up somehow
[1:31:07] <Maids4lyfe> paige is on pc
[1:31:14] <HotSauceFiend> I heard from one person only, that the ghame stuttering gets worse as the game progress for the PC version
[1:31:19] <Spydurman> @thesw1tch I'm only gonna get it if they fix it
[1:31:27] <+ReefTheWizard> im here to watch her get attacked by dudes she doesnt know about?
[1:31:32] <mumbojumbono13> The stuttering we are seeing isn't the performance though. this also hapens to e when I disconnect my controller so the controller turning on and off is causing the stutter we are seeing here
[1:31:33] <rudiciuscaesar> Stealth Paige Mode, acitvate
[1:31:38] <Broand> I mean that margit fight was doing the start-stop thing it does on my game too.
[1:31:40] <HotSauceFiend> in late game the skipping is supposed to be ridicilous
[1:31:42] <+MartinOfLoxley> @thesw1tch I'm waiting for them to fix it since I only have a PS4 Pro and not a PS5
[1:31:50] <+anoldtoilet> its something weird that will probably get patched because it was there in ds3 as well
[1:31:50] <An_Aimless_Avocado> @hotsaucefiend funny, i was just saying it got better for me as i progressed. who knows lol
[1:31:50] <rudiciuscaesar> Vega?
[1:31:54] <MaybeFalco> @HotSauceFiend 50 hours on the pc version, i've had minimal stuttering, mileage may vary
[1:32:04] <+anoldtoilet> ds3 also hard crashed to desktop if you tried to sit at the bonfire on release
[1:32:05] <+imthewisejanitor> Paige, try and remember the basics of CQC.
[1:32:09] <+ReefTheWizard> @MaybeFalco lower end gpu?
[1:32:14] <HotSauceFiend> maybe it was a case if one guy,
[1:32:19] <SulfurousAcid> things happen, we understand
[1:32:20] <+adamisbarely3d> I'm gonna get it when I get a Steam Deck, bc they're apparently working on a special patch to make it work with Proton
[1:32:21] <An_Aimless_Avocado> yea i haven't had that much stuttering on here. it's present but nothing like this
[1:32:22] <+anoldtoilet> yeah also it seems totally random. ppl with 3060s getting stuttering and low end gpus doing fine
[1:32:22] <rudiciuscaesar> WOW,  the game just aborted Paige

[1:33:25] <+ReefTheWizard> @MaybeFalco newer better cards have more problems, 1660 super, no stutters, minimal even when streaming
[1:33:28] <Broand> It's the game, I get the same issue (without the controller dropping out)
[1:33:28] <+Axellogic> I doot doot'd in my heart

[1:34:00] <cartakus> Oof
[1:34:02] <%holydeviant1> Elden Ring doesn't have an easy mode, but Paige found the hard mode!
[1:34:02] <Baljhet> don't do it pat she's gonna break it
[1:34:04] <+notsoy> i bet this is a PC problem, not a controller problem
[1:34:05] <+MartinOfLoxley> PAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAATUH
[1:34:07] <+Axellogic> Do you use an xbox one controller? that reminds me of the issues with them
[1:34:08] <%Dakuu75> I bet Pat has the BIGGEST smile on his face right now~
[1:34:10] <heartlesshealer> Tell him you tried switching the ports
[1:34:11] <+ReefTheWizard> you guys have cute couple energy
[1:34:12] <+chiazam> Is it really Paige breaking the controllers?
[1:34:12] <Broand> I'm like 90% sure it's not the controller
[1:34:15] <Cherokia666> Just put pillows around everything you own
[1:34:15] <+Nekros4442> @PatStaresAt Could it somehow be that she's switching focus away from Elden Ring to a second monitor?
[1:34:16] <Arancet> (totally her faultuh)
[1:34:17] <DrGhostJelly> the slow down might be due to controller shenanigans :(

[1:37:26] <SulfurousAcid> remember when paige sung this for us?
[1:37:35] <xxHungryxx> I did contest for this, is she holding green ketchup?
[1:37:42] <xxHungryxx> or soap

[1:40:32] <MaybeFalco> @PatStaresAt but pat, the controller tastes good
[1:40:35] <udurbalanced> Not fair. Pat crusted mustard into the buttons and she couldn't help herself
[1:40:38] <+HefestoForges> she might eat it when no one's looking
[1:40:40] <%rumtumtugnutz> I like how derpy emlo is

[1:45:32] <+HefestoForges> she only has eyes on the inside

[1:51:08] <+ReallyBigRocks> way worse
[1:51:08] <+Mexiflan> poise is a thing but they actually tell you how much you got
[1:51:09] <+blastyoboots> throwing knives are really useful here!  try crafting, it's easier than it sounds
[1:51:10] <+Axellogic> Main gate is shorter but harder
[1:51:11] <%pinkslimegoblin> main gate is easy just run through
[1:51:12] <+HefestoForges> try it Kappa
[1:51:22] <SulfurousAcid> you can roll through them to destroy them

[1:53:51] <%AncelDeLambert> @PeachSaliva how willing are you to detour to get a light producing item?
[1:53:52] <heartlesshealer> Well, more that lock on is for height differences
[1:53:55] <+HefestoForges> @rudiciuscaesar haven't heard her say "balls in my ass" yet

[1:57:25] <sun312772> it;s dad rock
[1:57:25] <+imthewisejanitor> I went to a concert once where the house music before the headlining band was slowed-down and distorted Britney Spears music. It played for over an hour. It was literal hell.

[1:59:19] <MaybeFalco> guard counters are REALLY good
[1:59:30] <%Chichen> @PeachSaliva you got an extra slot after killing the boss
[1:59:37] <%Dakuu75> does this talisman increase backstab dmg too?

[2:00:02] <Spydurman> boo, no maidens there
[2:00:07] <%rumtumtugnutz> Aw nuts, I donated money so I could point out that Smash came out in 1994 and it makes me feel my 39 years, but I forgot to add a message.
[2:00:07] <DanteReaver> guard counter isn't riposte
[2:00:10] <%zamatermort> Just be careful as the have a weight to them
[2:00:14] <%rumtumtugnutz> Enjoy the ten bucks though
[2:00:25] <MaybeFalco> @Dakuu75 just the counter, not the riposte

[2:01:51] <DanteReaver> Morrowind actually came out 37 years ago, feel old yet?
[2:01:58] <%HefestoForges> HefestoForges subscribed with Prime. They've subscribed for 2 months! You can do it, Paige! <3
[2:02:06] <%Chichen> it just is paige
[2:02:11] <Spydurman> too late
[2:02:12] <rudiciuscaesar> man, my horrible ex-wife went to the teenage daughter's school for parent teacher conferences and they thought she was a student, and she's older than me, and she was SO PROUD of herself for that and i was like "what do I look like...I'm 30something too."
[2:02:15] <nip_nips> it is dad rock whether you like it or not
[2:02:15] <Pookiedaexzile> Their fans had kids
[2:02:18] <Pookiedaexzile> those are dads

[2:02:55] <%zamatermort> LUL
[2:02:55] <%rumtumtugnutz> The only Offspring Album that came out in 1999 was the Offspring Collection
[2:02:58] <+imthewisejanitor> LUL
[2:03:01] <$thewhiterice92> Listen if Foo Fighters is dad rock and they formed in 94, then Offspring from ten years before them is definitely dad rock
[2:03:03] <%HefestoForges> FromSoft pls
[2:03:03] <+Mexiflan> that Here Kitty Kitty cover was amazing

[2:03:20] <%rumtumtugnutz> The Offspring's first album came out pre-Nirvana.
[2:03:35] <+imthewisejanitor> LUL
[2:03:37] <%greasypete00> pretty fly for a white guy?

[2:03:50] <SulfurousAcid> the kids aren't alright
[2:03:53] <MaybeFalco> kids aren't alright
[2:03:55] <Spydurman> kids aren't alright?
[2:03:56] <rudiciuscaesar> wow, the term pre-Nirvana is a good term
[2:03:58] <luckpunch> Jenny had a chance well she really did
[2:04:06] <%a_mad_dragon_> i saw the offspring live once, but there were 9 bands before them and my ears were wrecked
[2:04:09] <+barkon345> so is Sublime dad rock as well?
[2:04:13] <SulfurousAcid> instead she dropped out and had a couple of kids
[2:04:24] <%greasypete00> stacy dropped out and had a couple of kids
[2:04:27] <+Mexiflan> when we were young the future was so bright
[2:04:33] <Spydurman> Jamie had a chance, well she really did Woah-oh Instead she dropped out and had a couple of kids Woah-oh
[2:04:42] <+Pendragwn> luckily i found the lyrics on dadrock .com
[2:04:51] <MaybeFalco> @Pendragwn LUL
[2:04:52] <+whyskeywolfe> Offspring have more than Pretty Fly for a White Guy?
[2:04:57] <%HefestoForges> that reminds me of "Janie's got a gun" from Aerosmith and now I feel old too
[2:04:59] <+tetraes> oof reminds me of my childhood hearing that in the car
[2:05:03] <+imthewisejanitor> I'm 14 and this is deep.
[2:05:04] <+barkon345> id say Green day is more dad rock then the Offspring
[2:05:04] <%rumtumtugnutz> Bad Habit is the best Offspring song.
[2:05:06] <therustystream> I like the offspring songs in crazy taxi
[2:05:08] <%greasypete00> lmao i always heard it as "stacy dropped out"
[2:05:10] <therustystream> that's all offspring is to me
[2:05:20] <SulfurousAcid> "old woman yells at cloud"
[2:05:20] <heartlesshealer> old woman yells at cloud
[2:05:22] <%rumtumtugnutz> Green Day is definitely dad rock
[2:05:28] <+imthewisejanitor> Old Peach Yells at Cloud.
[2:05:33] <therustystream> GREEN DAY IS ABSOLUTELY DAD ROCK
[2:05:36] <LlamaZarate> GREEN DAY IS NOT DAD ROCK
[2:05:41] <%cade_calrayn> Yup
[2:05:42] <+whyskeywolfe> As Backstreet Boys said, it's gonna be me.
[2:05:46] <MaybeFalco> green day is SUPER dad rock
[2:05:46] <LlamaZarate> NO, AM I OLD TOO?!?!
[2:05:49] <+Mexiflan> oh no this guy is way worse
[2:05:50] <+barkon345> I was once "wit it" until what "it" was changed
[2:05:53] <cowboy_plague_doctor> I mean green day is old, but is it dad rock?
[2:05:54] <+anoldtoilet> halberd guy!
[2:05:55] <+barkon345> with it
[2:05:57] <%linSP> you're right, its not dad rock, its grandpa rock
[2:05:59] <%rumtumtugnutz> If you're in denial about bands form the 90s being dad rock, then you are a dad.
[2:05:59] <%cade_calrayn> Honestly, Paige, you can just run past him up the stiars
[2:06:01] <+notsoy> block
[2:06:02] <QueequegTheater> Oh my god Paige roll
[2:06:02] <%cade_calrayn> He's not worthit
[2:06:03] <%zamatermort> Congrats, you have now discovered those are just normal enemies
[2:06:07] <LlamaZarate> Peach, you shield hates you, lying on the floor all neglected
[2:06:08] <heartlesshealer> when he charges up for the big windy fart aura, he can't be stunned
[2:06:10] <Spydurman> you should get a Jesus emote
[2:06:12] <+Pendragwn> all this music talk is making my music memory go into overdrive
[2:06:12] <Reveresao> Well you dont have to fight the first guy again at least
[2:06:14] <BigBadWolf009> back stab helps
[2:06:15] <+TMulharin> It's okay, Paige. Halberd Man hates you. too.
[2:06:21] <MostFrank> How long did it take you to beat ebritus?
[2:06:27] <Reveresao> no
[2:06:29] <+Mexiflan> nope
[2:06:29] <%zamatermort> No
[2:06:29] <rudiciuscaesar> you mean does he respawn?
[2:06:30] <+Mekhet09> No he's a normal enemy.
[2:06:30] <+notsoy> the paige classic, holding a shield and never using it
[2:06:32] <MaybeFalco> watch out for that halberd man paige
[2:06:33] <%holydeviant1> God stirs on his holy throne, sighs. "Paige is streaming again. I hear my name taken in vain every couple seconds."
[2:06:36] <%HefestoForges> you can just run into the open door now
[2:06:37] <heartlesshealer> normal respawning enemies
[2:06:38] <therustystream> NOPE LOL
[2:06:42] <cowboy_plague_doctor> you don't hate you, you hate halberd man
[2:06:42] <%AncelDeLambert> you already got the key, so you can ignore shield dude
[2:06:49] <Pookiedaexzile> HE's a normal man with one spell
[2:06:49] <therustystream> but you don't have to fight him anymore anyways
[2:06:50] <+barkon345> bowling for soup is going to have to make an update to their song 1985 called 1995
[2:06:53] <+KyrlGrimblood> Is anyone else thoroughly entertained every time she adds an "-ah" sound to the end of a sentence?
[2:07:00] <heartlesshealer> yes
[2:07:05] <heartlesshealer> it's endearing
[2:07:13] <%HefestoForges> I wear that as my "helmetless" look
[2:07:15] <+anoldtoilet> lol the cone hats
[2:07:20] <LlamaZarate> @KyrlGrimblood never noticed this... the study commences...
[2:07:22] <MaybeFalco> i still don't know what the altered stuff does
[2:07:22] <+anoldtoilet> i see someone was farming the little goons in caelid
[2:07:42] <Reveresao> ladder......
[2:07:45] <%HefestoForges> I think it's just not "new"
[2:07:45] <%rumtumtugnutz> The first time I heard a song from the fucking 90s on a classic rock station I felt myself die a little inside.
[2:07:46] <+anoldtoilet> its like slightly lighter and lower def than normal stuff, and looks differnt
[2:07:47] <+Mexiflan> it is real sad
[2:07:56] <%HefestoForges> like the altered version is all ragged or something
[2:07:58] <rudiciuscaesar> circa 2004
[2:08:01] <+Mexiflan> mark stays at home cause he's got no job, just plays guitar smokes a lot of pot
[2:08:06] <nip_nips> so young, but listening to dad rock
[2:08:07] <%cade_calrayn> .... Paige, I hate to tell you this, but I've never heard of Offspring, and I'm 28
[2:08:17] <LlamaZarate> @KyrlGrimblood is it an -ah, or just ambient "uh" 's

[2:19:15] <tanarath> @barkon345 the starting cutscene said tarnished are those who die but don't stay dead.
[2:19:17] <Pookiedaexzile> Cavewoman in Knight Armor buys Magic scroll for the pictures
[2:19:21] <+Mexiflan> after you beat Godrick
[2:19:25] <tanarath> Those tarnished by death.
[2:19:29] <+Mexiflan> gives you a cool weapon too
[2:19:35] <%AncelDeLambert> YEAAAAAAAH I just beat Godrick!
[2:19:40] <%AncelDeLambert> suck it, creepy dude!
[2:19:43] <+anoldtoilet> there are a few different kinds of undead it seems like

[2:20:00] <%AncelDeLambert> eh
[2:20:05] <%HefestoForges> you'd have to check his pants
[2:20:06] <heartlesshealer> depends on what you find hard
[2:20:06] <+Mexiflan> Godrick is always hard
[2:20:07] <therustystream> it's the same as the dude in the dark room

[2:20:15] <%zamatermort> It's the same type enemy you've fought twice already
[2:20:15] <slipdog> beware of beating ass
[2:20:17] <%Dakuu75> there's still a lot to do in this castle before you wanna fight him
[2:20:21] <HotSauceFiend> He's only hard if you make him hard
[2:20:24] <%AncelDeLambert> I almost beat him the first time I saw him
[2:20:26] <heartlesshealer> That's "another enemy is in my way" movement pattern
[2:20:27] <%rumtumtugnutz> And anyway, I was born in 1983 and there losts of bands I like from the 60s and 70s. Good music is good music.
[2:20:36] <%AncelDeLambert> the fire is the hardest part, tbh

[2:25:34] <%rumtumtugnutz> @barkon345 I don;t get your point.... You can buy like every album ever recorded on CD, and discmans and stuff like that were huge when I was in high school, so maybe five or six years difference isn't that much of a stretch. You don't have to listen to a band when they're new to be into a band.
