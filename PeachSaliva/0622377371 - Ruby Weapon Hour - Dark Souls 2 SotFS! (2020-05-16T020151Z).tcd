[0:05:33] <lotharrio> It's no surprise to me, Paige is her own worst enemy. Cause every now and then she kicks the living shit out of Weapon, Ruby. Can we forget about the things she said while mustard drunk?

[0:06:46] <$Sphincter_Spelunker> @StaceMcGate it might be rolling out to a select few. I don't see it either
[0:06:52] <%Jetssam> but the lupus makes her always close to death
[0:06:55] <NoHoldsBarredProductions> Paige has a fever, and the only prescription is YOU DIED

[0:22:35] <%TheFilth> I wish I could enjoy popular things but I'm a pretentious asshole
[0:22:35] <%oda_flobunaga> The problem with DS2 is that in so many parts it simply manages to be un-fun, whether its bs enemy placement or stupid level design or braindead bosses...

[0:40:11] <%RafflesiaA> That's the acid bug ain't it
[0:40:11] <dabeaminator> You always say you do better when Pat shuts up, so logically you'd be at your greatest power when he isn't there at all.
[0:40:12] <islandsunn> enemy
[0:40:12] <%optimasmaximas> @Zulrez perhaps crazy talk is the cause of sun down?

[0:48:38] <Phob05> Good job, Dark Hole
[0:48:41] <tusk102> @Sphincter_Spelunker i think it's less distraction and more her not having the option of just going "PAAAAAAT"
[0:48:42] <Daisuke89> @PeachSaliva Have you noticed how you do play better with Pat not here??
[0:48:43] <%spiritofmojave> this is going pretty good

[1:41:21] <+patriotrenegade> after acquiring the forgotten key down in the gulch, head back to Majula and jump down the well. There will be a ladder that will lead to a forgotten door. inside will be 3 chests and a corpse. The corpse contains the Dragon Talon. If you pay Laddersmith Gilligan 12,000 souls for the longest ladder, getting to the forgotten door is easier. (Automatically added to inventory on Xbox 360 and PS3).
[1:41:23] <%g0atmeal> You need to do bottom of black gulch first

[1:42:23] <Dragon_Batman> You have 100,00
[1:42:24] <%Skelegroove> 500 soul ladder is funny
[1:42:24] <+mMayrro> its 3 different ladders
[1:42:25] <+angel949> 12k
[1:42:25] <%omnicrescendo> buy all three!
[1:42:27] <Jarvanii> more expensive ladder goes deeper
[1:42:28] <2fcd_twitch> Only the most expensive one
[1:42:28] <Phob05> Yeah all of them

[1:42:30] <Fujiwara_92> it's just 12k
[1:42:31] <derap41> By them all
[1:42:38] <+consistentlylistless> buy LADDUR

[1:42:39] <Fujiwara_92> buy them all
[1:42:39] <Phob05> They're cheap
[1:42:43] <Zarkith> Frozen Flower is almost impossible to miss
[1:42:43] <NaturalGear> isn't it better to buy it later when souls are easier to come by?
[1:42:44] <$DesertPenguin> DLC is so far from now, should she use her souls now for levels and get this ladder later in the game?
[1:42:47] <%Keyd00d> monkaS
[1:42:49] <Scorchfield> there are 3 ladders, one for each payment, might as well get them all
[1:42:50] <buerdo> Buy all ladders for lawls
[1:42:54] <%g0atmeal> Don't buy 500 one
[1:42:54] <2fcd_twitch> @commandersqueaks It's fine
[1:42:55] <Monkeyweed21> They're cheap
[1:42:55] <Valentinius_Anodyne> First is funny, but pointless
[1:42:56] <+mMayrro> don't buy the first one tho
[1:42:56] <Dragon_Batman> You have 100K
[1:42:57] <%velemi> Cheer1000 If we're being fair, things like Iron Keep being above earthen peak is probably more because you're supposed to be going to areas that are very far away across an entire continent, but for some reason they didn't want to do a level select like demon souls and just mashed levels together
[1:42:57] <%DesuDesuDokiDoki> fair
[1:42:57] <$Sphincter_Spelunker> are you having fun
[1:42:58] <MarylandJutsu> sell elmo for more soulls
[1:43:00] <$DesertPenguin> YE YE YE

[1:43:02] <+Sebenoth> She’ll still want to place the ladder anyway
[1:43:03] <%GohanHitsugaya> Good choice.
[1:43:07] <+badchoice5> The poison key sucks
[1:43:07] <FacetiousAF> pat is lying

[1:43:21] <lotharrio> Better call. Might as well get levels, get to a later area and then buy that whatever.

[1:50:46] <+TreeeFOX> put 10 into JOE
[1:50:49] <Hydrapissed> Greatsword 11?
[1:50:52] <+CommanderSqueaks> Oh thank god
[1:50:52] <+GuildmasterAhnonay> 16 DEX
[1:50:53] <DandyMackeroos> Damage is okay, but survivability is much better
[1:50:53] <Kalcom> put 16
[1:50:54] <+CommanderSqueaks> Okay
[1:50:54] <Pookiedaexzile> PAT IS NO LONGER IN CONTROL
[1:50:55] <$DesertPenguin> IT only goes up by 10 from 40-48, it's not worth it
[1:50:55] <Monkeyweed21> Look at the stat loss
[1:50:55] <Jarvanii> this was all for the one level of dex
[1:50:56] <+trustycoyote> Check the attack on the right @PeachSaliva
[1:50:58] <%RafflesiaA> wow TEN WHOLE POINTS
[1:50:59] <EuropanLamprey> RED NUMBER FUCKERS
[1:51:03] <$DesertPenguin> Strength back to 40 is best
[1:51:11] <femto216> BibleThump BibleThump
[1:51:13] <cosmicgoatee> greatsword 11
[1:51:13] <Kazic5000> ALL IN ADP
[1:51:17] <Dragon_Batman> The dex addition helped
[1:51:18] <%oda_flobunaga> plus 10 more damage only... SUCH a frackking waste
[1:51:20] <+CommanderSqueaks> It's better now.
[1:51:20] <$DesertPenguin> but not much, put the points in VIGOR
[1:51:23] <+cdrom321> FUGginS sword.
[1:51:23] <+LegacyOfTheSith> this respec isnt adding much lol
[1:51:26] <+CommanderSqueaks> Before 10 dex it was nightmare.
[1:51:27] <Hydrapissed> I SAY more adp or vit
[1:51:27] <derap41> Pat look up red rust sword
[1:51:29] <Pookiedaexzile> WHY
[1:51:31] <EuropanLamprey> get adp to 32
[1:51:32] <+trustycoyote> Yes
[1:51:34] <%Skelegroove> 16 DEX
[1:51:35] <$DesertPenguin> he's right, back to 40
[1:51:36] <%Keyd00d> sure
[1:51:36] <@Jekado> wait she isn't rolling though
[1:51:36] <derap41> yup
[1:51:37] <+CommanderSqueaks> This is fine
[1:51:37] <hamster_eater> RUINED
[1:51:37] <Kalcom> dex!
[1:51:39] <@Jekado> she is using shield
[1:51:39] <+Caidezes> STR to 40 for now.
[1:51:42] <$DesertPenguin> 40
[1:51:43] <+CommanderSqueaks> Wait, she's not rolling?
[1:51:43] <%g0atmeal> 40 STR better
[1:51:44] <%DesuDesuDokiDoki> str 50
[1:51:44] <MyNameIsRasus> Into ADP
[1:51:45] <Finakala> Adp is a dump stat, use END or VIG like you had before
[1:51:45] <+GuildmasterAhnonay> 16 DEX
[1:51:45] <vinceshamwowslap> looks good
[1:51:46] <+luckypineapple> Better ADP is never a bad idea
[1:51:46] <%DrFaustMD> Isnt she using a shield?
[1:51:47] <Kazic5000> ADP THE STAT FOR ME
[1:51:48] <Zombrocom> 40 str, get more AGL
[1:51:49] <Fujiwara_92> 40 is fine
[1:51:50] <+Archphronimos> if she has greatshiled she should be tanking more
[1:51:50] <MyNameIsRasus> 40 STR
[1:51:51] <+cdrom321> 40 str and then ADP.
[1:51:52] <+AlphaBankai> NO PUT MORE VGR, the softcap is ridiculous
[1:51:52] <$DesertPenguin> 10 damage isn't worth it
[1:51:52] <+Archphronimos> less rolling
[1:51:52] <Monkeyweed21> you lose a lot of HP
[1:51:56] <Orenjevel> whatever, paige is good enough to beat the pigs she can beat the game
[1:51:57] <%Keyd00d> to have a decent sip
[1:51:58] <DandyMackeroos> ADP is the best stat
[1:51:58] <$DesertPenguin> it's 32, not 33
[1:51:59] <$RutilusMonachus> What's the point building so hard into AGL if she has a great huge greatshield?
[1:52:00] <$Sphincter_Spelunker> why are you like this, pat
[1:52:01] <Dragon_Batman> She will be rolling here and there
[1:52:01] <$DesertPenguin> i think?
[1:52:02] <+CommanderSqueaks> Why roll with shield?
[1:52:03] <derap41> Compare the damage from 40 and 50
[1:52:06] <+cdrom321> 32 ADP.
[1:52:09] <%worldbrand> what higher vit??
[1:52:11] <+comfyman12> VIT the same dum dum
[1:52:12] <DandyMackeroos> Rolling is always good
[1:52:12] <glass_marcus> considering how you tore through the last boss in 7 hits, i think you have enough str righ now
[1:52:19] <Hydrapissed> adp
[1:52:20] <%oda_flobunaga> @PeachSaliva you 1 shotted 2 bosses in a row do you really need to optimize?
[1:52:21] <Hydrapissed> I mean vit
[1:52:22] <%RafflesiaA> Or dex
[1:52:23] <$DesertPenguin> VGR
[1:52:24] <Radski5> VGR
[1:52:24] <Archer27> PERFECT thank you
[1:52:25] <%Skelegroove> 16 Dex
[1:52:25] <Pookiedaexzile> Not to late to pull out
[1:52:27] <Hydrapissed> VIT
[1:52:27] <+dirtyh4rr1> Good
[1:52:27] <%Lion_kun> DEX
[1:52:28] <%DesuDesuDokiDoki> ok
[1:52:29] <derap41> Lost 50 hp
[1:52:29] <%Chichen> VGR or end
[1:52:30] <+CommanderSqueaks> That's fine
[1:52:30] <+GuildmasterAhnonay> PUT IT IN DEX
[1:52:31] <Hydrapissed> YAHH more armor
[1:52:32] <MyNameIsRasus> OK
[1:52:33] <$DesertPenguin> it's one point of damage, that's not worth it
[1:52:35] <st_judge> Power stance never
[1:52:35] <+luckypineapple> Where we at in game?
[1:52:35] <lotharrio> Pat is obsessing about min-maxing, but he also always spends like a day or so grinding way past the level he would be so it's sort of HahaSweat HahaShrugRight
[1:52:36] <+Caidezes> GOOD
[1:52:36] <@SoFarFetched> @oda_flobunaga to be fair those two weren't really great bosses.
[1:52:36] <%g0atmeal> This is the DS2 experience
[1:52:39] <%TheZearGuy> She doesn’t roll though
[1:52:40] <$DesertPenguin> not if you don't need it
[1:52:40] <Orenjevel> good
[1:52:40] <Tersalus> we're all wrong R)
[1:52:41] <xanerts> GOOD
[1:52:41] <%worldbrand> It's fine
[1:52:42] <$DesertPenguin> give yourself more health
[1:52:42] <MyNameIsRasus> BETTER
[1:52:43] <derap41> its good
[1:52:43] <%Keyd00d> seems needless since you level up so much in this gmae
[1:52:43] <Monkeyweed21> you lose 60 HP and get 5 AGL
[1:52:44] <+CommanderSqueaks> It's fine now
[1:52:45] <%Keyd00d> but sure
[1:52:45] <$DesertPenguin> health
[1:52:48] <a_mad_dragon> GOOD
[1:52:49] <%g0atmeal> It's fine

[1:52:50] <Fujiwara_92> sure
[1:52:50] <%velemi> sure
[1:52:50] <+AlphaBankai> Pat, have you looked at Cinders mod? Fixes a couple of your issues with DS3, adds shortcuts to break linearity and like 300 new weapons/rings

[1:52:56] <djblue_shift> SeemsGood SeemsGood
[1:52:56] <Radski5> It's fine, you just lose 15% of your HP
[1:52:57] <@Jekado> does she need rolling if she is using shields?
[1:52:58] <EyeFarted> WHATEVER...
[1:52:58] <%LynbellDaYo> fuck it, go ahead
[1:52:59] <$DesertPenguin> You don't need the equip load

[1:54:33] <%ssjklyco> Just pretend chat is just 1 guy right now.
[1:54:33] <spoiledbadger> your fine
[1:54:33] <$DesertPenguin> Paige, seriously, and I'm not fucking with you, STR at 40 is good. Putting it to 50 doesn't give you a bit enough damage increase to make it worth it
[1:54:33] <+Chewygamer> its 50 hp out of 1400...
[1:54:34] <koolaid_kevster> numbers don't matter doe
[1:54:34] <+king_of_beggars> Believe in Pat's functionality.
[1:54:34] <Daniel_Is_I> It's 60 fucking HP
[1:54:34] <Orenjevel> you have a SHIELD
[1:54:35] <Zayasu> NOO
[1:54:36] <%Keyd00d> that's so little hp
[1:54:37] <+CommanderSqueaks> NUMBER GO DOWN
[1:54:38] <+bear_breaker20> Ch-eck
[1:54:38] <+AntithesisEK> ~100 ain't gonna help you
[1:54:39] <VJdarkworld> quick maths
[1:54:40] <SwindlerOfProgress> YOU did this, Pat
[1:54:40] <%nobody12349> Pat's voice is cracking
[1:54:40] <%worldbrand> It's 4%, that's the math you're looking for
[1:54:40] <@SoFarFetched> Paige is scared cause number go down.
[1:54:41] <%DesuDesuDokiDoki> LUL LUL LUL
[1:54:42] <@PlagueOfGripes> they're almost the same exact numbers. really you're just wasting a soul vessel because Pat is obsessed with meaningless number optimization
[1:54:42] <Coystick> Paige is ONE GUY
[1:54:42] <$Puhff> Yeah you do
[1:54:43] <+Caidezes> oh my god
[1:54:43] <vinceshamwowslap> pat wants you to get the soft caps
[1:54:44] <+shadoke> Adding to Dex now that you are capped at STR might increase your damage more
[1:54:44] <deepspaceshine> ONLY 38 HP Kappa
[1:54:44] <$Sphincter_Spelunker> Pat's being the guy. Not you
[1:54:44] <%chronoxgp> BloodborneThemesExplored.pdf May 16, 2020, 12:55 AM
[1:54:47] <AxelCezar> HP in DS2 is very important, there are too much bullshit in the game
[1:54:47] <SwindlerOfProgress> This is all your fault, Pat
[1:54:49] <Fujiwara_92> IT'S 38
[1:54:50] <Ashenik1> OE
[1:54:50] <coreyyotto> otherway around
[1:54:50] <buerdo> It’s basically the same as it was before hand none of these changes even matter
[1:54:51] <%velemi> Paige it's fucking nothing its fine
[1:54:52] <Crimpson> I can just imagine Pagies vows at the wedding.. Pat.. I trust you... but I trust Eli more.
[1:54:52] <$Puhff> Fuck it up, you know you want to
[1:54:53] <$DesertPenguin> you don't need 10 extra damage....
[1:54:53] <+CommanderSqueaks> @plagueofgripes Literally all it is.
[1:54:54] <+Jaysky> PAT, even if she messes up her stats she can ALWAYS reset her stats in Dark Souls 2.
[1:54:54] <Ashenik1> ONE GUY
[1:54:55] <Kazic5000> 60 hp is like 30% of an average attack.
[1:54:58] <islandsunn> int to zero
[1:54:58] <%hotdough> if it doesn't work out use another soul vessel
[1:54:58] <+angel949> 9d6
[1:55:00] <+dmtjinni> LUL
[1:55:01] <$DesertPenguin> put it in VGR
[1:55:02] <YakumoYomi> 50HP probably isn't even a single hit.
[1:55:02] <@PlagueOfGripes> so really you're just doing this for Pat
[1:55:03] <lotharrio> @PeachSaliva It's not Pat messing with you. It's his mind-goblins telling him to try and min-max you. I wouldn't worry about it, but I wouldn't do this a second time until you actually run into problems.
[1:55:03] <%g0atmeal> Saved you earlier today
[1:55:04] <VJdarkworld> CONFIRM

[1:55:18] <derap41> Pat doing basic math on stream is really brave because you can look like a dumbass doing that
[1:55:20] <%Keyd00d> Pat is pleased
[1:55:20] <$Agami23> that amount of HP saved her from the poison earlier
[1:55:21] <%EynosStyles> Paige you are literally play with 60% of your life bar.
[1:55:21] <VJdarkworld> put it all into resistance 4Head
[1:55:24] <Animorphimagi> Crazy talk
[1:55:25] <$DesertPenguin> 50 STR isn't needed it

[1:55:36] <Zombrocom> 50 str isn't reaaallly worth, but yeah that works
[1:55:36] <$Sphincter_Spelunker> 10 minute detour to sate the pat goblins
[1:55:37] <@Calek> you'll need 40 dex eventually
[1:55:37] <$Puhff> Don't listen to him

[1:55:40] <%oda_flobunaga> @PeachSaliva this will take three more years now
[1:55:40] <%g0atmeal> Honestly it's doable no matter what you level from here
[1:55:42] <$DesertPenguin> 10 points from 40 - 50 are better used in Vigor
[1:55:43] <malesin_01> YOU FOOL!!!!!

[1:55:53] <smargh1015> it's just numbers, skill is what really wins souls games
[1:55:53] <OldDarkwraith> @PeachSaliva Soft caps don't mean much in DKS2. When in doubt, dump into VGR, END and VIT
[1:55:54] <+CommanderSqueaks> @sofarfetched Was there literally any point of that point reallocation?

[1:56:55] <lotharrio> Drangleic Set is heavy. The Alonne set she can get here is pretty good too.
[1:56:57] <+Yosepmeist> its nbd
[1:56:58] <Monkeyweed21> She can upgrade to the headless guys armor when she finds his body
[1:57:00] <Kazic5000> Could rock that pimp sallet helm.
[1:57:01] <%encrouched> Hot stuff cummin thru
[1:57:02] <derap41> you never picked it up :(
[1:57:03] <@SoFarFetched> @YakumoYomi think she's sticking to hammer mostly,along with great sword depending.
[1:57:03] <+patriotrenegade> u didnt get Vengarl's stuff!
[1:57:05] <+Archphronimos> you could be a pretty butterfly
[1:57:08] <$DesertPenguin> It barely increases equip load. Do you still actually need it to keep a good roll?
[1:57:15] <derap41> headles guy is just straight up better
[1:57:17] <+Jaysky> Big iron on his hiiiiip
[1:57:17] <jimmytwofeet> GYRM BRUH

[1:57:22] <@SoFarFetched> She never killed Vengarl's body.
[1:57:24] <%Trenr> did Paige finish spider zone?
[1:57:25] <MyNameIsRasus> GYRM GANG

[1:57:43] <%g0atmeal> FURRY BOOTS
[1:57:46] <$Sphincter_Spelunker> You could get Elite Knight so early in 1 and Faraam is so late in 2. No wonder I don't remember wearing it

[2:36:14] <derap41> This game is literally killing Paige
[2:36:17] <Tersalus> you can throw from fairly far away
[2:36:18] <@Jekado> i love how the knife hitbox is larger then the doorway
[2:36:20] <%encrouched> Praise this inanimate poison knife

[2:36:36] <Coystick> Fight him ONE ON ONE HUGE
[2:36:43] <Valentinius_Anodyne> @Coystick I mean, it's pretty clearly designed this way, so it was an intended option
[2:36:43] <+Chewygamer> RUN
[2:36:44] <2fcd_twitch> Torch would be useful for lock on range
[2:36:45] <DandyMackeroos> Weirdo pervos with their glory hole faces

[2:36:59] <Klefth> JUST USE A TORCH
[2:37:00] <+CommanderSqueaks> Torch makes it so you can lock on from further, Peach.
[2:37:04] <derap41> The anus face
[2:37:04] <+cdrom321> The heavy crossbow is better.
[2:37:05] <@Jekado> best way to play darks souls is to not play dark souls
[2:37:05] <lotharrio> One hit did do like... 80% of your health.
[2:37:07] <zamzoph> "Last"

[2:43:54] <derap41> Rock armor is really un optimal
[2:43:55] <DickChapyGaming> become stone
[2:43:55] <%RafflesiaA> And it's better with shit stats unupgraded, that's amazing
[2:43:56] <DandyMackeroos> Retrospect is a bitch

[2:44:05] <@PlagueOfGripes> havel's also looks like a pile of garbage
[2:44:06] <Zombrocom> I think greatshield of glory has more stability right?
[2:44:07] <derap41> LUL
[2:44:07] <@SoFarFetched> but they had to move numbers around.
[2:44:08] <+Chewygamer> her equip load is too high too....
[2:44:10] <%oda_flobunaga> @PatStareAt Just use another Soul vessel
[2:44:10] <%aslfrasle> Check the armor too. It's super big
[2:44:12] <@SoFarFetched> to make it work.
[2:44:12] <+CommanderSqueaks> Pat you literally told her how to allocate her points.
[2:44:15] <Dragon_Batman> Out of all that and you didn't make shure?
[2:44:16] <DatAsuna> PERFECT PAT
[2:44:20] <@Calek> having the shield on puts you at 70.3% you need like one or two points of vitality
[2:44:21] <@Jekado> like most of the game looks like poop
[2:44:24] <$DesertPenguin> It looks cool tho
[2:44:24] <+trustycoyote> At least she does have to go get it later
[2:44:25] <+Chewygamer> LORE Kreygasm
[2:44:27] <%RafflesiaA> Paige do you really remember Havel

[2:44:28] <+CommanderSqueaks> It's not upsetting Pat, it's just hilarious.

[2:45:33] <Zombrocom> Only thing is you to unlearn who roll muscle memory
[2:45:34] <@Calek> @Sebenoth DS2 poise is still good
[2:45:35] <+trustycoyote> Why roll when big strong @PeachSaliva
[2:45:37] <@Jekado> just fucking throw away the evade its worthless now
[2:45:37] <$DesertPenguin> probably in the 600
[2:45:37] <oOZtkOo> rip the roll button out of the controller
[2:45:38] <GunEden> but smelter armor
[2:45:39] <+BubbaRands> psaBig D
[2:45:39] <%TheZearGuy> Points in adaptability well spent
[2:45:40] <+moink1234> doesn't ds2 have shit defense
[2:45:41] <@Calek> DS3 poise is what's pointless
[2:45:46] <Klefth> 766
[2:45:46] <%Skelegroove> Can you upgrade armor in ds2?
[2:45:48] <$DesertPenguin> 776
[2:45:48] <subjectg> We need the smelter mask for maximum scrub
[2:45:49] <+linSP> almost 1k slash defense
[2:45:49] <DandyMackeroos> It’s like full body ugly boots
[2:45:50] <gluttonousmimic> Welp, goodbye invincibility frames. Death yells intensify! SabaPing
[2:45:50] <dabeaminator> You'll still get staggered though, because Poise hasn't worked right since DS1.
[2:45:52] <$SinisterBroccoli> Big sigh

[2:45:56] <+Chewygamer> pat DS2 doesnt let you poisetank like DS1 does
[2:45:58] <Josef_Stryker> DS2 has more emphasis on hyper armour doesn't it?
[2:45:59] <+Sebenoth> Eh, fair enough, i just remember it being less, my bad
[2:46:01] <+CommanderSqueaks> Who said this armor looks like shit? You are super wrong.
[2:46:01] <@PlagueOfGripes> it's not dark souls 1 poise or anything, but
[2:46:02] <$DesertPenguin> Hit Y
[2:46:05] <+HotZoneTurtle> Those are her stats, not her armors
[2:46:07] <derap41> about double for a 50% weight increase
[2:46:08] <%JenovasPuppet> That hammer looks so tiny next to the Havel set.
[2:46:10] <$DesertPenguin> Bottom right

[2:46:26] <+Sebenoth> I usually use Flynn ring in DS2 and wear paper armor
[2:46:27] <Zombrocom> You just have to remember to NEVER ROLL
[2:46:27] <kurejichi> Pat this isn't DS1 it isn't going to be that impressive
[2:46:28] <DandyMackeroos> At least it isn’t DS3 poise
[2:46:28] <derap41> Knight Ring
[2:46:31] <%TheMattman1313> Havella
[2:46:31] <+GuildmasterAhnonay> Put on the royal soldier ring
[2:46:33] <%Skelegroove> Upgrade the armor then
[2:46:34] <%RafflesiaA> Keep the big shield it's fine

[2:54:20] <+cdrom321> Every other good build is nerfed.
[2:54:21] <@SoFarFetched> Paige always wants to be in people's asses and destroy their buttholes.
[2:54:22] <lotharrio> She liked Bloodborne, though?
[2:54:22] <bimjojo> 3000 hours - not recommended
[2:54:23] <@Jekado> could be worst could be caster build
[2:54:24] <+linSP> paige is str only

[2:54:52] <Neo_Kaiser> My opinion is the same as Matthewmatosis, Dark Souls 2 is better than most games in the last decade, but it's still a disappointment.

[3:03:36] <%worldbrand> I have a friend like you
[3:03:36] <DracaenaLeaf> Same
[3:03:37] <+Lunaticbro > psaMenace psaMenace psaMenace psaMenace psaMenace
[3:03:38] <%sharpington_> Did you like WarHeads?
[3:03:41] <Valentinius_Anodyne> That sounds revolting, but you do you friend
[3:03:42] <%CrypticMochi> brownSPOOKY
[3:03:44] <Dragon_Batman> That's the do it
[3:03:44] <ittla> better than kids who just eat ketchup and shredded cheese
[3:03:49] <derap41> Via elevator
[3:03:51] <%omnicrescendo> same here but with 57 sauce
[3:03:54] <DedlokPM> Time is convoluted in Drangleic
[3:03:55] <Tatrix912> I too...drank the pickle juice WutFace
[3:03:55] <DandyMackeroos> Mustard on Pizza
[3:03:59] <$DesertPenguin> IF IT MADE SENSE?!
[3:03:59] <%oda_flobunaga> It makes all the sense
[3:04:00] <ittla> mustard at least means you have a 'complex palate'
[3:04:05] <derap41> so many teleportation elevators
[3:04:09] <%optimasmaximas> in bloodborne?
[3:04:09] <LaughingCatt> they would have solved the problem my making the elevator just go down instead of up
[3:04:10] <@Jekado> its just the RE elevator
[3:04:12] <Zombrocom> Iron keep is on top of the mountain behind the windmill, it just doesn't properly communicate the travel to it though
[3:04:13] <%ssjklyco> A portal at the top of the windmil would make more sense
[3:04:13] <derap41> They do it once in this game
[3:04:14] <Dragon_Batman> They did have the bird thing earlier
[3:04:18] <Dragon_Batman> Funny enough
[3:04:18] <%sharpington_> that does happen, you did that
[3:04:19] <%TheMattman1313> Alternatively the sky in the Windmill area is a lie
[3:04:19] <+xeros720> maybe an airship or a mount
[3:04:19] <+Blargimazombie> It would have been fine if the elevator went down into a cavern
[3:04:21] <Valentinius_Anodyne> Yeah, that or the elevator just going down
[3:04:24] <%Zulrez> but paige a bird totally takes you places in this game LUL
[3:04:24] <Josef_Stryker> A bridge maybe
[3:04:25] <%CommanderSqueaks> CommanderSqueaks subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 9 months! As much as it's fun to bitch about you ruining it Pat, you made Peach even huger and that's never a bad thing. MOST of us are just saying that for funsies.

[3:09:01] <%Skelegroove> Tarkus working correctly is the only thing that matters
[3:09:01] <%ssjklyco> "You ruined the playthrough of a game I am not playing myself"

[3:09:12] <derap41> @ittla yeah there is
[3:09:13] <%LuchaDePucha> woolie loves his spears

[3:09:21] <Dragon_Batman> In all truth I think the Souls stuff has been the best playthroughs specially 1 and 2 @PeachSaliva
[3:09:24] <HoldBtoRun> that DS2 playthrough got me INTO Dark Souls in the first place

[3:13:23] <DandyMackeroos> @sphincter_spelunker Oh boy Skele Tiers
[3:13:26] <@SoFarFetched> @optimasmaximas yeah I know but my assumption is pat is doing a DS stream instead of Rev2 so she can rest at least.
