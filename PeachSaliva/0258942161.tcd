[0:42:28] <%TheOnlyStrayCat> cheer1500 So, to walk off the whitest fucking singing ever on this stream, time to talk about what MY white ass dealt with last week! A customer tried to get me fired by claiming I was racist for refusing service for her rude ass! Luckily, the store knows how I am enough that they literally laughed it off.
[0:42:28] <+flyingsnakes3> they are delaying the inevitable

[2:01:41] <elementofloyalty> @hrdronot
[2:01:42] <AncelDeLambert> Indigo jumps the shark and then it's a fever dream

[2:01:48] <+BryBreadmin> @cluelesssniper everyone who has a switch but didnt have the wii u is like "wow all these new games are great" and all of us who had a Wii U are just like :|
[2:01:55] <AncelDeLambert> Beyond is just reprehensible all the way through
[2:01:55] <ThePushaMan> No heavy rain is a dumb game with a stupid plot
[2:02:04] <TalisKanju> What about all that blackout trash that goes nowhere?
[2:02:07] <Luvinsus> How long until they find out that Funky can safely land on spikes? LUL
[2:02:12] <ThePushaMan> its not just the twist
[2:02:13] <Too_Much_Nukie> Heavy Rain falls apart under scrutiny.
[2:02:15] <elementofloyalty> never
[2:02:18] <%SergeEXE> LUL
[2:02:24] <+blewbeary> oh yall doin baby mode
[2:02:25] <GalaxyGirlChel> what do your funky eyes see
[2:02:26] <AncelDeLambert> oh, it absolutely IS a terrible game. But worse than the rest of the Cage mistakes?
[2:02:27] <$ThatLoliFromPersona> If funky cam do that he's broken
[2:02:29] <+blewbeary> i mean funky mode
[2:02:31] <$ThatLoliFromPersona> can
[2:02:31] <+LiveStreamOnyx> @luvinsus WHAT tppowerBulk
[2:02:32] <Rngiddion> I am going to what a Games Done Quick run of this after the stream is over. To bask in the difference
[2:02:42] <%breakfastmegapowers> We need more funky eyes on the inside
[2:02:42] <yalwin_khales> Heavy Rain would be interesting, if it was rewritten by someone who was actually competent.
[2:02:43] <neuroticbiotic> Heavy Rain has no Navajo spirit battles, and is thus slightly less of a mess
[2:02:50] <Kenori> I'm fairly certain Funky can surf on spikes
[2:02:51] <Huntercd> Should I watch those LPs again?
[2:02:51] <ThePushaMan> oh yeah, heavy rain is still cages best
[2:02:53] <+unfoldingchoas> as funky try to jump on the spikes
[2:03:00] <@thenefftw> AMAZING
[2:03:00] <elementofloyalty> PRESS A
[2:03:14] <AncelDeLambert> Cage is the videogame Lucas, he needs someone behind him with a ruler to slap his knuckles ever time he gets weird
[2:03:20] <%skizzuto> you couldn't tell which one the game wanted you to choose?
[2:03:21] <GalaxyGirlChel> Paige can do it
[2:03:27] <+BryBreadmin> it's fucking true Funky can land on spikes cant he
[2:03:27] <elementofloyalty> LUcky Ted
[2:03:32] <yalwin_khales> Paige can't do it
[2:03:34] <AncelDeLambert> If he had oversight, his games might be good
[2:03:34] <Firesparks> paige would be pocket?
[2:03:37] <deviljhojho94> Judas paige
[2:03:38] <+BryBreadmin> HE CAN

[2:04:21] <$Metroidzard> So you're telling me the future refused to change?
[2:04:22] <TalisKanju> Yeah, that's my biggest problem with Cage. His games tend to go off the deep end.
[2:04:23] <$googleygareth> LUL
[2:04:36] <+unfoldingchoas> lol they did notice
[2:04:37] <TheNeedlesD> It still hasn't dawned on her right?

[2:37:53] <elementofloyalty> fem boy
[2:37:54] <zamzoph> BEATRIX Kreygasm
[2:37:54] <FrostMass22> Pat probably told her that her womb was barren like the Gobi Desert.
[2:37:56] <+Aetropos> hell yeah beatrix
[2:38:03] <Eresus> lol
[2:38:03] <%AbnormalVoid> Beatrix is best FF9 character
[2:38:05] <+LuckyChocobo> Beatrix is great.
[2:38:07] <$RaussX> pat googling intensifies
[2:38:08] <@PlagueOfGripes> she had some big honkers
[2:38:09] <$ThatLoliFromPersona> tipping intensified
[2:38:13] <OkamiDude15> @PeachSaliva did pat tell you about his stash of candy in the cabinets?
[2:38:15] <%AbnormalVoid> she sure did
[2:38:16] <DantesAnimus> We'll be generating some head cannon lines for what he said
[2:38:17] <Bouldus> no vivi is, but beatrix is close
[2:38:17] <@Moobot> Do you have a Fanfiction for Paige to read? Submit it to us here and it may get read on stream! http://bit.ly/2jsxJo9

[2:38:17] <elementofloyalty> BOObs
[2:38:20] <$BryBreadmin> paige likes sexy but big strong outfits, makes sense
[2:38:24] <$RubberFistFight> @deviljhojho94 - nah, it was something armor-piercing and cruel, but probably deserved. Pat is very good at making dry, snarky, and very insulting comments.
[2:38:30] <TalisKanju> Is Beatrix the girl with the hot sister?
[2:38:32] <fireking900> Hey Plague
[2:38:33] <$siamesesneeze> It's TACTICAL Cleavage!
[2:38:37] <%Remery_> Stiener looks like a fat chode
[2:38:39] <%ziriken> for those wondering what pat said to get almost stabbed, he said he was glad she had a miscarriage so she couldnt bring that ******baby into this world

[2:43:06] <Huntercd> Diddy has a jetpack, so does that mean Woolie will steal it from him?

[2:44:44] <%captainthunderwolf> Chat, is Funky Kong the only character in history to wear a charismatic wifebeater?

[2:48:05] <Lagzlot> I love the minecart levels in this game because the music tells you when to jump, like the pop music levels in Rayman Legends.
[2:48:06] <$RubberFistFight> @captainthunderwolf - English vernacular is fucking littered with examples of things like that though. One of my personal faves is "getting gypped". Most people think it's "jipped" because they don't know the origin of the phrase.

[2:49:33] <%captainthunderwolf> @RubberFistFight I've got the correct ancestry to say the phrase "filthy Romani" instead, but yeah, I've actually come around to realize that's a rude phrase. There really is a buncha super unkind vernacular in this here hodge-podge post-German dialect mutant language, yepper.

[2:51:34] <%captainthunderwolf> ^
[2:51:37] <$RubberFistFight> @deviljhojho94 - I also just realised that this relationship is a perfect rebuttal to dudes who think being short means hot women won't be interested.
[2:51:39] <$Metroidzard> Good start
[2:51:43] <deviljhojho94> I know a guy that is only a torso. Then again, I live in Mexico

[2:54:54] <$BouyantSoul> that one Funky Kong ASMR thing made Funky not so cool in my eyes
[2:55:08] <Shade075> How many downed planes are on kong island????
[2:55:11] <elementofloyalty> nothing
[2:55:14] <$Metroidzard> @captainthunderwolf We were just talking about that. Bermuda Triangle
[2:55:16] <Ell1ot> banabnas
[2:55:17] <SwindlerOfProgress> Funky even breathes underwater.
[2:55:27] <elementofloyalty> all of them
[2:55:28] <Amberizing> this isnt Kong Island
[2:55:32] <Lagzlot> This isn't even kong island, those vikings booted you off kong island all the way to whereverthisis.
[2:55:33] <$BryBreadmin> yeah, Bermuda triangle
[2:55:35] <$RubberFistFight> man the whole ASMR thing is the weirdest shit. Most people who think they're able to trigger it actually aren't and just sound like pretentious idiots.
[2:55:38] <Strideral> They live on cursed island
[2:55:38] <TezarroEX> the lore
[2:55:39] <Too_Much_Nukie> Bermuda Triangle? More like, BANANA Triangle!
[2:55:46] <%captainthunderwolf> @Metroidzard Either that or the bananas are fucking magic
[2:55:50] <$renegadehatter> cheer100 Hey Pat, feel like we got off on the wrong foot with the whole Banjo thing earlier, but let's move to more positive news; thanks to you I started reading through Jojo for the first time and just started Stardust Crusaders this morning so I'm pretty excited (Read this next part to yourself) You are my favorite of the Best Friends and my hate comes from respect. Hope to keep watching you for years my man!

[2:56:31] <$RubberFistFight> Not only that, I'd wager the majority of them don't even know what ASMR actually means, nor that it's actually not a scientifically-confirmed thing and often gets confused with a sensation known as "frisson"
[2:56:31] <@Moobot> Do you have a Fanfiction for Paige to read? Submit it to us here and it may get read on stream! http://bit.ly/2jsxJo9
[2:56:36] <TalisKanju> That is a horrible abomination. Not a Sea Lion.

[2:58:50] <%captainthunderwolf> @RubberFistFight Alternatively, the planes were staffed by penguins, which is an adorable thought that still guarantees thousands of death and thus is a little less adorable.
