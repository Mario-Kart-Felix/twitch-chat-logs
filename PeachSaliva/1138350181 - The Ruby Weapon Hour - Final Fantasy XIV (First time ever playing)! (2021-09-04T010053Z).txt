[0:08:26] <+the_mental_punk> I’m not super familiar with mmos, but I find them interesting, just have a hard time staying involved on my own. But thanks for all the input to everyone who responded
[0:08:28] <+tomdwarf> People like the story. It is good, but unfortunately imo it doesnt get good till the tail end of 2.5.
[0:08:30] <%Dirty_Dandere> Pat said he would be here
[0:08:34] <+zamatermort> It is time!
[0:08:40] <NoHoldsBarredProductions> I paused one of Pat's ME3 VODs to come here. This is how it should be.
[0:08:42] <%ORGANizerC> Pat is just an idea
[0:08:43] <$DensityD> it's presumptuous
[0:08:44] <%BoxNavy> you know what this means? it means pat can get the wedding chocobo now
[0:08:46] <HypoNegative> Pat needs some fame time
[0:08:48] <%DianaTheAscian> I think Pat was joking about her doing the free trial
[0:08:54] <+Bailey__gaming> I hope she gets to see skeleton as there are some
[0:08:56] <$DensityD> it's Patsumptuous

[0:09:27] <+tomdwarf> @the_mental_punk I mean, I watch all 3, so I guess I count.
[0:09:35] <$DensityD> hi the_mental_punk
[0:09:35] <%ORGANizerC> Pat better pull out the platinum wedding gear
[0:09:35] <Mortal_Wombat_I> @tomdwarf honestly? ARR is probably the weakest writing in the entire game, but even then it was leagues better than that OTHER MMO which I came from. Just has pacing issues I think
[0:09:36] <@SoFarFetched> as a reminder please don't talk about future story stuff for FF14 in here.
[0:09:38] <%ORGANizerC> it's even on sale
[0:09:39] <%Chichen> stream buffering?
[0:09:40] <+fetrigon> @the_mental_punk sup

[0:10:04] <%EyeFarted> LAG
[0:10:04] <%Chichen> Big lag
[0:10:04] <+tomdwarf> @Shonen_hero Its just SO GENERIC, with no stakes that really grab me. Its not bad, but its so boilerplate as to be completely unremarkable.
[0:10:07] <%TheWinged7> anyone else getting frame drops?
[0:10:07] <~PeachSaliva> Shit, I'm lagging??>?
[0:10:08] <%SuckerPunchSyd> I hope for either Fem Roe or Viera
[0:10:08] <%dayz1003> Hope you're doing well Paige! I finally got a chance to use my Prime sub for you. My fiance has been watching you the past two years to help her fall asleep while I've been stuck on night shift. Thank you for taking care of her. :) PS I tweeted a charity I wanted you to look at but I don't know if you ever got it.

[0:11:21] <%Chichen> it seems to be better?
[0:11:22] <%DianaTheAscian> No said Pat
[0:11:23] <CappuccinoGuil> @Shonen_hero ARR is just so boilerplate because so many quests are just... pointless. There's so much fluff for nothing. Quests that are literally "Go to A, talk to NPC, go to B, talk to NPC, go back to A, talk to NPC, done"
[0:11:25] <+Shonen_hero> is Gief sitting on the internet
[0:11:27] <HypoNegative> PAT STOP DOWNLOADING FURRY PORN
[0:11:29] <+strugglepunk2> @dankjerri yes but have you considered max tall femroe

[0:11:34] <%Chichen> @PeachSaliva it seems good now?
[0:11:37] <@commanderclaw> Cheer500 Here's some advice, don't think about FFXIV as an MMO-RPG, think of it as an RPG-MMO. It's a Final Fantasy game where when you go into a dungeon or fight a boss you team up with some friends! Much love, and good luck!
[0:11:38] <+strugglepunk2> for the ultimate BIG AND STRONG experience
[0:11:44] <@StridentSong> I'm not seeing any framedrops anymore

[1:09:19] <@StridentSong> The whole stream is lagging :<
[1:09:20] <@PlagueOfGripes> not everything is caused by internet speeds
[1:09:20] <%Birdigalore> Who's on ***
[1:09:20] <%Chichen> settings too high
[1:09:20] <peachyprimrose> Damn it Pat this is your fault somehow
[1:09:21] <Solidus_113> I don't think you capped your FPS in the menu before starting
[1:09:21] <solracc25> game lag too
[1:09:22] <teefpal> You're gonna have to lower settings
[1:09:23] <MechaBaphomet> who's on the phone
[1:09:25] <MayShip> settings are maybe to high
[1:09:25] <+nocturne_reverie> mayhaps less settings on ultra
[1:09:26] <+LilyaFatal> Keep going for now
[1:09:26] <+Bailey__gaming> Heh SKELETON PORN
[1:09:27] <TheYellowcouch> Restart computer time
[1:09:28] <+Mendin> Paige's techno-curse is back in force
[1:09:28] <%Dakuu75> @PeachSaliva maybe lower your graphics settings for the game?
[1:09:29] <mustachegolem> it's not pat
[1:09:29] <maybefalco> gotta stop downloading 4k skeleton porn
[1:09:34] <%SveriSageAdvice> earlier you were lagging, im assuming its Twitch
[1:09:35] <+MoonObscure> ^
[1:09:36] <+BigCoffee> keep going maybe its cutscene
[1:09:36] <OldManDeckardCain> 5 terabytes of skeleporn is not nothing, paige
[1:09:39] <@JustinianKnight> a setting might be fuckin with it
[1:09:42] <+Chaos_Aether> Game is set to high
[1:09:43] <tubit> she's running it in 2k
[1:09:44] <%Nobrev> ff14 could run on a toaster honestly
[1:09:45] <@PlagueOfGripes> good thing the background will never run out of trees
[1:09:46] <Madovir> turn SSAO down
[1:09:46] <anAngryHamster> Computer is burning
[1:09:48] <%JenovasPuppet> Just continue until you finish the scene. It's good enough for the moment
[1:09:48] <%Ranryu692> this looks like Drakengard 3
[1:09:49] <%zamatermort> It happens, nbd
[1:09:50] <+LilyaFatal> It could be a lot worse
[1:09:51] <mismagilou> np it's ok
[1:09:51] <+coolthulhuu> this is just starting mmos
[1:09:51] <disflipmat> It's the effect of 1,000 people making new characters on your server
[1:09:52] <$KnivesEve> its on brand though
[1:09:52] <+Snacbo> Yeah, I have a friend that Vtubes and sometimes it causes this kinda lag
[1:09:54] <%dankjerri> wait for patih
[1:09:55] <flameod2> Rarely
[1:09:55] <+SWFanatic> its the games fault
[1:09:56] <%blue8moon> ff14 can run on a potato
[1:09:56] <+BigCoffee> Just finish the cutscene and see
[1:09:56] <+coolthulhuu> also on brand
[1:09:57] <%miabyte> maybe CPU throttling, should check task manager
[1:09:59] <%Dakuu75> @PeachSaliva or maybe try full screen vs borderless window, see if there's a difference
[1:09:59] <BigFingerRo> That's on brand for you , tho, no one gets mad at that
[1:10:00] <+Chaos_Aether> your likely capping your system
[1:10:00] <peachyprimrose> Yeah it's possible it might be settings, FFXIV can run on a lot of things but that's not without adjusting settings in some way
[1:10:00] <%ORGANizerC> gridania got a looootta trees
[1:10:01] <%walternatorz> are you clicked into the game? it has a setting to slow down frame rate if it's playing in the background
[1:10:01] <Valdorick> BIG sweat
[1:10:03] <+nocturne_reverie> you can change it as soon as you get into game, fortunately
[1:10:04] <flameod2> Even a potato could run this game
[1:10:04] <%barkon345> ff 14 dose not require a beefy PC to run
[1:10:05] <%JaydenSai> Its weird watching your Vtuber's boobs swing in slow motion @PeachSaliva
[1:10:05] <+Gudren> @Ranryu692  well this was designed with PS3 in mind
[1:10:07] <KaiserMario> Could be worse... Could be Pat LUL
[1:10:09] <OneThousandTomatoes> I would also check the game's resolution
[1:10:12] <%dankjerri> oh yeah pull up task manager
[1:10:13] <prime_name> Why is Endwalker there?
[1:10:16] <Mortal_Wombat_I> I assume it’s the vtuber rig? The game has incredible performance whenever I’ve played it
[1:10:21] <%Cozy90> jimminy christmas
[1:10:22] <Explodincatz> how can anyone read this text?
[1:10:23] <@PlagueOfGripes> usually slowdown on vtuber rigs is caused by effects
[1:10:24] <%BoxNavy> 😳
[1:10:27] <mismagilou> yep
[1:10:28] <$hrbeck_> did you touch video settings yet?
[1:10:29] <$KnivesEve> wow is ugly to me
[1:10:29] <MechaBaphomet> 😳
[1:10:29] <flameod2> It has to be the vtuber
[1:10:29] <+Kiaayo> @PeachSaliva click on the game
[1:10:29] <%dankjerri> you will want to fuck every noc

[1:10:35] <Tracazoid> FF likes their sexy characters
[1:10:37] <%other_badger> wow has better furries
[1:10:37] <%AncelDeLambert> WoW sucks
[1:10:38] <+Noeralf31> hmm, this does seem to be a notable fps drop
[1:10:38] <+MoonObscure> wow LUL
[1:10:38] <tubit> I think the vtuber avater is the culprit
[1:10:38] <%JenovasPuppet> The modding community for this game is STRONG
[1:10:39] <%Gouf_Troop> Blizzards style is pretty ugly
[1:10:39] <TheYellowcouch> big sexy people
[1:10:42] <%DianaTheAscian> Wow always looked kinda ugly
[1:10:42] <Starotter70> Wow is uggly
[1:10:42] <%Birdigalore> Everyone in WoW is muscle freaks
[1:10:44] <+Mekhet09> what class
[1:10:45] <%QueequegTheater> Jaina cosplays in FFXIV look better than Jaina does in WoW
[1:10:46] <SubjectX07x> Wow is for people who really like HOOVES.
[1:10:48] <NateyBeak> is this sponsered? cuz the endwalker thing in the corner there staring at me... endwalkeryry
[1:10:48] <Solidus_113> everyone in ff14 is sexy (no potato people)
[1:10:52] <BigFingerRo> PAAAATHUUUU
[1:10:52] <+MoonObscure> pathhhhhhhhh'
[1:10:52] <%dankjerri> PAAAAAATUH
[1:10:53] <+Gudren> Its warhammer aesthetics vs final fantasy
[1:10:53] <+Noeralf31> PaaaAAAAaaaat
[1:10:54] <+goose_attack_almanac> FF14 : Hot anime boys. WoW: YOU WANT SOME HUGE HECKIN SHOULDER PADS
[1:10:55] <JojoPiero> Blizzard and all 5 polygons of character model
[1:10:56] <+MoonObscure> TOUCH
[1:10:57] <peachyprimrose> It's somewhat difficult to make an unattractive character in this game
[1:10:58] <+Grayhammatter> paaaaaaaatuh
[1:10:59] <FullMetalEmblem> lol had deja vu with dat reaction
[1:10:59] <@PlagueOfGripes> try turning your vtuber rig off for a second and see what happens
[1:10:59] <%zamatermort> PAAAAATUH
[1:11:00] <+CalderGaming> final fantasy PUHAAAATUUUUH
[1:11:06] <+NYCrownlessKing> ^ @PlagueOfGripes
[1:11:08] <Subsidium_> Yep for sure
[1:11:08] <mismagilou> yep good idea
[1:11:10] <peachyprimrose> Yup, that's def a good idea
[1:11:10] <@SoFarFetched> yeah turn off the vtuber rig
[1:11:10] <+YoSoyConando89> It's Final Fantasy. Everyone is at least a 7
[1:11:11] <OneThousandTomatoes> thats normal
[1:11:11] <Swine_Slime> Smart
[1:11:12] <@SoFarFetched> it might be that
[1:11:12] <NateyBeak> OH! yes, the 100% right thing to do

[1:12:02] <+TreeSapling_Ca> Wow the timing
[1:12:03] <peachyprimrose> Was she clicked out of the game???

[1:12:11] <%walternatorz> I think she didn't have it open in the foreground
[1:12:19] <+SWFanatic> @peachyprimrose you might be right
[1:12:22] <flameod2> Yup she was just tabbed out
[1:12:23] <+Noeralf31> vineKermiepls
[1:12:24] <+geekjacob> you can get rI'd of chat
[1:12:24] <+spleekle> The stream cant handle a bunny girl AND a fox vtuber
[1:12:29] <%blue8moon> yeah, it's a default setting
[1:12:34] <flameod2> Game is always that slow tabbed out
[1:12:35] <NateyBeak> someone call their phone and tell them quick
[1:12:36] <%Cozy90> is that the sonic music??
[1:12:41] <zeroeightsix> I think the curse isn't the framerate, it's caring about the framerate
[1:12:50] <+TreeSapling_Ca> @PeachSaliva I think you were alt tabbed with the settings to lower framerates when FF14 is the inactive window
[1:12:55] <peachyprimrose> @flameod2 Not always, but by default it limits framerate when the window isn't focused
[1:12:56] <$Sphincter_Spelunker> so what class is a Lancer? melee damage?
[1:13:04] <+Lordgale119> melee dps
[1:13:04] <+CalderGaming> @Sphincter_Spelunker yup
[1:13:05] <+Eaglestrike117> Melee DPS, yeah
[1:13:05] <%blue8moon> yep
[1:13:06] <+Kiaayo> lancer is dragoon
[1:13:07] <+Gudren> Yes Lancer is melee deeps
[1:13:09] <+Lordgale119> proto dragoon
[1:13:19] <$Sphincter_Spelunker> Ah. Thought she would have gone with ranged.
[1:13:19] <flameod2> just tested it 16 fps when i tabbed out
[1:13:30] <peachyprimrose> I'm glad she's joining the DRG gang tho
[1:13:31] <+Toshatron> @TreeSapling_Ca the music was playing and she didn't check playing sounds out of focus
[1:13:32] <+Eaglestrike117> its paige dude, she wants to stab things
[1:13:32] <+goose_attack_almanac> is it fucked that I know the brand of mustard she transforms with
[1:13:32] <%blue8moon> paige isn't a coward Kappa
[1:13:34] <%TheHateFish> Melee DPS, turns into Dragoon, famous for backflipping off the edge and dying
[1:13:35] <zerointelligence000> what happened?
[1:13:44] <+Kiaayo> framerate was shit, she's trying to fix it
[1:13:44] <+Bailey__gaming> Lancer is poke wit stick till dead
[1:13:45] <$Sphincter_Spelunker> @TheHateFish oh no
[1:13:47] <%JenovasPuppet> The vtuber model was also low frames.
[1:13:48] <kainhighwind1990> @TheHateFish nah that's red mage
[1:13:50] <+jerkhov> You don’t have to stay the job you start as anyway
[1:13:54] <flameod2> Vtuber+tabbed out means poop frames
[1:14:03] <+Lordgale119> it's perfect for her
[1:14:03] <MrPandastic> It's not a Pat or Paige stream unless something gets fucked up at the start.
[1:14:26] <%TheHateFish> @TheHateFish Nah, Red Mage exists to cast Ver-Raise and flashbang the entire raid with their LB3
[1:14:26] <%WebmanJax> Yeah, Dragoon's job is to tank the floor. Everyone knows that.
[1:14:41] <%QueequegTheater> Wait was she playing in fullscreen instead of borderless?

[2:08:45] <Melchior_the_Wise> oh thank god
[2:08:49] <MarlooRedd> the real John Cena is the friends we make a long the way
[2:08:52] <CappuccinoGuil> @Melchior_the_Wise Paige got swarmed by chat in her world and got super awe-struck by everyone's characters
[2:08:53] <%Calek> and the first quest
[2:08:54] <Melchior_the_Wise> So I just made it in time
[2:09:14] <Mortal_Wombat_I> I adore how wholesome this entire interaction has been
[2:09:23] <CappuccinoGuil> Hehehehe.... she said list
[2:09:32] <Melchior_the_Wise> of course she's a Viera
[2:09:40] <%Estuko> @SakuraYui You'll find one, I was invited to a free company because I dressed like a pirate and it's pirate themed. Best free companies are friends imo, but there's ones for hard core raiders or stuff like that. ♥ It'll come to you
[2:09:50] <%DianaTheAscian> you can change the size of these menus if its to big or small
[2:09:57] <Laioken13> had to leave that mess it was making my computer put the fans on high

[2:11:11] <TheYellowcouch> Yeah this will probably lessen over time
[2:11:13] <FishSkeleton> Oh cool, she's going Lancer first?   I always would've thought Paige's Huge Quest would lead to Marauder first but stabby stick is a welcome surprise.
[2:11:15] <%JenovasPuppet> @dredgyboi Pat's character is way taller than her though
[2:11:16] <%DianaTheAscian> Pat is actually taller in this
[2:11:18] <TheYellowcouch> Everyone just wants to get in big time

[2:25:43] <+fromnibelheim> I just joined, so excited to see paige is a dragoon! It's been my main job since the beginning :)
[2:25:50] <%Fooguwu> @peachsaliva Im quite sure you skipped my donation from earlier tonight
[2:25:54] <+Jackgar> Viera is definitely suitable due to tall and hot, but I won't lie, I think Femroe would be perfect.
[2:26:04] <+Jackgar> Because BIG and STRONG
[2:26:14] <%Fooguwu> my sub message I mean
[2:26:20] <+doc_ock_rokc> @PeachSaliva send me picture and I'll make a 3d model of your character
[2:26:20] <%flagi64> Yep
[2:26:35] <%flagi64> NJ resident, got evacuated from my home
[2:26:51] <%flagi64> that sucked
[2:26:53] <%Chichen> @PeachSaliva Hope you enjoyed the cosplay surprise. I'm going to tweet you some pictures on twitter later! I took off the cosplay for now to show off my normal look
[2:27:06] <JohnAtDawn> @flagi64 Like, forcibly?
[2:27:14] <+doc_ock_rokc> im kinda sad paige isn't a potato
[2:27:21] <%JenovasPuppet> Are you ready for RACISM?
[2:27:31] <Sameriarix> Still talk to Ywain for now
[2:27:32] <%MrBorisMakarov> lance quest
[2:27:39] <%JenovasPuppet> Lance
[2:27:41] <AdmiralButtloaf> Ywain
[2:27:55] <$hrbeck_> Bunny boys are november, I can’t wait
[2:27:58] <%Jackgar> Jackgar subscribed at Tier 1. 
[2:28:08] <+trackles_64> this game so complicated
[2:28:27] <%Jackgar> I would always suggest people to do their class quests ASAP, priority over everything else
[2:28:28] <%Chichen> no
[2:28:33] <%JenovasPuppet> He is just a boy boy
[2:28:34] <JohnAtDawn> Ywain is a pretty cool guildmaster
[2:28:39] <%Jackgar> Since they unlock skills and gear
[2:28:48] <Monkeyweed21> this man is wearing oven mitts
[2:28:48] <+fromnibelheim> I forgot that he's kinda hot huh
[2:28:57] <%sandrews> sandrews subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 2 months! Hey Peach hope  you had a good day!
[2:28:57] <superdude22> He's got no style
[2:28:58] <%QueequegTheater> Poke, hard
[2:29:01] <superdude22> He's got no grace
[2:29:07] <%Jackgar> I think she's taller than his lance....
[2:29:10] <$hrbeck_> The lancer gear has no style
[2:29:12] <%JenovasPuppet> Ywain is pretty cool, but he's now Hamon Holyfist
[2:29:15] <%Jackgar> If you count the ears
[2:29:21] <%Kay_Tana> Di
[2:29:28] <ohno778> THRUSTS
[2:29:29] <+SammyOVision> You will face the floor. a lot
[2:29:30] <asdief_> ywain has no drip. sad
[2:29:39] <$NitronStreams> Long hard thrusts
[2:29:49] <%Dregon_Azure> @peachsaliva Family is all ok, we live in southern Louisiana and I got a new house like 1 week prior to the storm hitting, luckily no damage to my house, rode the storm out in my house and been working near 15 hour days since since I work for a power company
[2:29:50] <%JustToWatch> no drip fr fr
[2:29:56] <%Jackgar> Listen, I'd wear a literal clown suit if the stats were right
[2:30:00] <%Kenzo2000> There is a LOT of text in the early game, Paige. You may not want to read it all out loud
[2:30:14] <%flagi64> @JohnAtDawn water levels rose to a point where they shut the power off for safety. My area was oddly dry but down the street both ways was underwahter
[2:30:14] <$GarbageNirvana> Just narrate it like an old-timey radio announcer
[2:30:23] <+logoth_> In Limsa they say steamed hams
[2:30:23] <Solareon_> there's soooo much old english, you just end up memeing it eventually
[2:30:26] <%QueequegTheater> It's cool until you have to read 10 lines from baderon in a row
[2:30:28] <+logoth_> its a regional dialect
[2:30:35] <%JenovasPuppet> I'm shocked that big axe didn't win out over tanxiety.
[2:30:38] <Monkeyweed21> its time for 11th grade English to flex its worth
[2:30:40] <MrNoobMcSalt> dost thou knowest of thine automobile insurencess
[2:30:42] <%Jackgar> Wait until she meets a certain fancy-talking boy...
[2:30:44] <%blue8moon> the freaking rogue quest dialogue
[2:30:46] <$hrbeck_> ARR is a grind and they tried to make it better
[2:30:53] <zerointelligence000> we don't get scared... we just stand in aoe and die :3
[2:31:03] <ohno778> And jump right into the middle of AoEs
[2:31:05] <+logoth_> lol
[2:31:06] <%rumtumtugnutz> Ligm Lominsa
[2:31:13] <%rumtumtugnutz> *Ligma
[2:31:17] <%Jackgar> I think it's appropriate she went with Lance/Dragoon, since she's dying all the time IRL
[2:31:17] <%flagi64> @hrbeck_ honestly didnt mind the AAR grinf, i got to heavensward and dropped off cause the story moved too slow for me
[2:31:21] <%Estuko> @rumtumtugnutz its okay
[2:31:30] <Vermillion129> do it
[2:31:31] <+logoth_> Wayne
[2:31:35] <DrStinkers> you wayne?
[2:31:36] <+doc_ock_rokc> yo-wang
[2:31:38] <%Jackgar> Yeah I just say Wayne
[2:31:38] <$hrbeck_> A lancer will die a thousand times to pierce a foe once
[2:31:38] <+Noeralf31> you Wayne?
[2:31:42] <%JenovasPuppet> You rang?
[2:31:43] <JohnAtDawn> Have you the resolve to BECOME A SICK-ASS DRAGON KILLER IN THE FUTURE?!
[2:31:44] <+AmanisHouseOfNonsense> Have you the resolve to sweep the floors of thine enemies?
[2:31:45] <%barkon345> @hrbeck_ it's soooo much better now. you can get to level 30 and your job within a couple of hours
[2:31:46] <asdief_> @blue8moon is jack italian its very unclear
[2:31:46] <DancesWitBalrog> what a beautiful DUWANGGG
[2:31:53] <%rumtumtugnutz> @Estuko I'm on Crystal, so Balmung disagrees. :P
[2:31:56] <%Jackgar> @hrbeck_ Dragoon armor is LITERALLY designed with being eaten by a dragon in mind
[2:31:58] <kilochii> REALLY HARD
[2:32:04] <SlagChambers> Just fucking S E N D I T
[2:32:06] <%nip_nips> ladybugs, a true menace
[2:32:08] <+doc_ock_rokc> KILL THE LADY BUGS
[2:32:14] <CryoByjorne> Murder the ladybugs super hard
[2:32:15] <+doc_ock_rokc> FOR THEY ARE LADY
[2:32:16] <+Noeralf31> sanctioned murder!
[2:32:16] <%other_badger> FUCK THE BUGS Up
[2:32:16] <zerointelligence000> kill animals for no reason to become a true lancer
[2:32:18] <%MrBorisMakarov> time to kill some shit
[2:32:23] <%Puhff> KILL BUG
[2:32:24] <%blue8moon> @Jackgar look, as long as you kill the dragon on the way down, who cares if you die?
[2:32:28] <Basch71> murder the local wildlife
[2:32:28] <+CaptainJax> Them squirrels had it too good for too long
[2:32:31] <tubit> kill all the smol things
[2:32:32] <%rumtumtugnutz> Kill bugs and mushrooms
[2:32:39] <%Jackgar> I see she's already learned the art of spin-jumping
[2:32:40] <count_bob> You should touch the little crystals you see around.
[2:32:41] <Srthunda> look at these guys with all their fancy spears
[2:32:44] <$hrbeck_> @barkon345 that’s not the grind though
[2:32:46] <%blue8moon> do msq first, since it's in the city
[2:32:47] <+Stormzcales_Lair> Finish talk first
[2:32:48] <%Puhff> talk to guy
[2:32:51] <%Ranryu692> ABKS Always Be Killin Shit
[2:33:04] <Mahrota> It's better than the Conjurer start. "We vibe with nature, go kill some small animals with a rock"
[2:33:04] <%Jackgar> Has she been attuning?
[2:33:12] <%blue8moon> nope
[2:33:24] <+FancyFishies> Follow the lil triangles on your mini map
[2:33:28] <Monkeyweed21> theres an arrow on your minimap
[2:33:28] <%Jackgar> That's unfortunate
[2:33:28] <buddhistmetal> minimap has a marker too
[2:33:29] <%Dregon_Azure> @peachsaliva thanks for the good wishes! I need to be up for work in 6 and a half hours so hope you have a great remainder of your stream and enjoy your time in ff14!

[2:39:07] <iosephe> Click it to become poor
[2:39:08] <Estwilde> But it wants you to peruse it
[2:39:08] <Tracazoid> Don't look at the Blanka board
[2:39:09] <%Birdigalore> literal human trafficing
[2:39:10] <Thepothero> The Money Board coxJam
[2:39:10] <Kain5707> the MB is a Blanka player
[2:39:10] <Aleate> The market board mains Blanka
[2:39:12] <%JenovasPuppet> There are more shops south
[2:39:13] <%Estuko> I didn't touch market board till like, mid/end Heavensward lol
[2:39:15] <vierleger> Don't TALK to crafting players, don't shake their hands
[2:39:17] <OneThousandTomatoes> so many people buy things on the marketboard for more than in game verndors sell
[2:39:20] <+healnavi> PAIGE THE MARKET BOARD HAS CUTE PUPPIES
[2:39:22] <OneThousandTomatoes> its silly
[2:39:25] <+doc_ock_rokc> I need to play FF14
[2:39:29] <+doc_ock_rokc> maybe when i have time
[2:39:37] <%Jackgar> "Thrust? Oh goodness"
[2:39:40] <AdmiralButtloaf> aethernet
[2:39:45] <OneThousandTomatoes> but I will gladly make money boff they're inability to use google to look things up
[2:39:46] <%Puhff> oh i didnt know Pat got his Crafting Mentor
[2:39:48] <+FancyFishies> Follow the quest arrows on the mini map
[2:39:51] <tubit> Don't listen to Pat. There's bargains on the Market Board. BARGAINS
[2:39:52] <afronooch> it takes a little to get used too
[2:40:00] <$NitronStreams> youll get used to it
[2:40:00] <$CorruptDropbear> I have to ask - wouldn't KB+M be better for Paige?
[2:40:04] <%Kenzo2000> The menus seem like a nightmare on controller
[2:40:10] <buddhistmetal> you're learning :D
[2:40:11] <$Sphincter_Spelunker> @doc_ock_rokc you starting? I'm thinking about testing a new PC with a trial run
[2:40:14] <%blue8moon> you'll get there
[2:40:14] <%Jackgar> Never touch the market board, but ALWAYS touch the thing that lets you sell on it
[2:40:17] <count_bob> Don't forget to touch the small crystals you see around. Those are mini teleporters.
[2:40:19] <%TheWinged7> i mean you are, but nothing has changed there
[2:40:19] <%DianaTheAscian> oh thats a fast way to close those menus I never thought of
[2:40:20] <iosephe> No, it's complex
[2:40:22] <@Jekado> it took me a WHILE to get this UI
[2:40:22] <%Ranryu692> @CorruptDropbear not for her wrists
[2:40:26] <%Jackgar> Nah controller is actually super good, you just have to get used to it
[2:40:34] <%Jackgar> Controller is much more comfortable
[2:40:50] <Monkeyweed21> your first MMO is a bit to take in
[2:41:02] <%DianaTheAscian> Oh this game is awkward as hell at first to doing anything feels super weird
[2:41:06] <%JenovasPuppet> Omg how do you not know the map yet? It's like you haven't been playing this game for 8 years!
[2:41:08] <%Jackgar> Peach be lovin' the catbois
[2:41:11] <@JustinianKnight> dont encourage the catboys

[2:52:53] <%Jackgar> LR+A will bring up the teleport menu
[2:52:57] <%JustToWatch> BEDMAN
[2:53:03] <%Jackgar> @Ynkubus_ Yup. You can craft it. There's also a chair mount
[2:53:04] <+Grayhammatter> Bedman
[2:53:05] <moranprime> Everyone and their mounts LUL this is cool
[2:53:08] <%GalacticaPhanto> Isn't the bed a PvP mount?
[2:53:10] <Srthunda> the bed mount has to be made by a crafter
[2:53:12] <$Sphincter_Spelunker> first one's free
[2:53:12] <+Noeralf31> Kreygasm
[2:53:13] <Subsidium_> That's the most important part! The butt!
[2:53:14] <+KingpinLarry> Don't be nervous. That's the plan
[2:53:15] <+RandyFistburgers> Bunbuns
[2:53:15] <%Birdigalore> I thought I was the only person who remembers Little Nemo
[2:53:15] <+tomdwarf> Get to see that sexy butt. at all times
[2:53:17] <%Jackgar> There is SO MUCH BUTT you can look at in this game
[2:53:20] <Monkeyweed21> MMOs are very comfy games
[2:53:20] <%DianaTheAscian> You can get a nicer butt later
[2:53:21] <deity_majora> Paige knows of little nemo... I'm shocked a little bit
[2:53:23] <+3d_pbandj> You'll get clothes soon enough
[2:53:25] <%JenovasPuppet> Say goodbye to that butt as soon as you get your first piece of new gear LUL
[2:53:27] <%Jackgar> There's even a leg armor that makes your butt way bigger
[2:53:29] <+Noeralf31> just wait until you get into the dress-up aspects
[2:53:29] <%blue8moon> and you're playing a bunny, so you can always have a good butt
[2:53:30] <+Ynkubus_> @Jackgar oh man, I may work towards that now
[2:53:33] <Explodincatz> it gets very tedious at a point
[2:53:37] <%sandrews> Eh who cares about reading
[2:53:39] <OneThousandTomatoes> you'll get used to jt
[2:53:39] <$NitronStreams> take in rhe view before it gets covered by the newbie gear
[2:53:40] <%MrBorisMakarov> guys careful about your mounts blocking the screen :)
[2:53:42] <+tactician0> @peachsaliva are you gonna get into the ERP part of the game?
[2:53:43] <%Jackgar> @Ynkubus_ You'll want to raise Carpenter
[2:53:52] <+ArcanumArcanum> @GalacticaPhanto it's crafted. You get the materials from treasure maps, or the MB
[2:53:53] <%JenovasPuppet> Just play the game 8 hours a day for several years and you'll learn all the maps.
[2:54:03] <$Sphincter_Spelunker> atpCarl @tactician0
[2:54:06] <$Jibsoar> How's floor tank treating you? They do start in the the prettiest starting town.

[2:54:29] <+FancyFishies> PAT make sure you get some Glamor crystals and teach Peach about Plates so Peach can look at her characters peach the whole game
[2:54:31] <%Jackgar> You're going to be thinking "I like your outfit" SO MUCH in this game!
[2:54:35] <OneThousandTomatoes> no
[2:54:38] <$JoshManVGH> The quest log has a button that says Map, and when you press it, it brings up the big map and marks the place you need to go. Like how it looks on the minimap
[2:54:40] <+SergeEXE> only Some Jobs
[2:54:40] <%Chichen> no, depending on class
[2:54:41] <cobalt_phoenix_> depends on starter class
[2:54:41] <+Noeralf31> always remember to make use of the aetherites a LOT
[2:54:42] <zerointelligence000> it depends on your first class
[2:54:42] <%blue8moon> starting area depends on class

[2:54:48] <+SammyOVision> There are 3 cities
[2:54:48] <%Puhff> no

[2:54:53] <$JoshManVGH> It is a city
[2:54:54] <AdmiralButtloaf> lancers archers and conjurers
[2:54:55] <tubit> In the early version of the game, Gridania was just a straight up maze
[2:55:04] <%QueequegTheater> Marauder and arcanist
[2:55:07] <UvBenServed> Rogue
[2:55:10] <Zeikier> Monks are also Uldah
[2:55:14] <%QueequegTheater> Can't start as Rogue
[2:55:16] <%blue8moon> you can't start as a rogue tho
[2:55:23] <+logoth_> THRUST
[2:55:23] <%Jackgar> Yeah you can go to every single one of the guilds and unlock the ability to play every class. It's awesome.

[2:55:41] <+Noeralf31> hitlist
[2:55:47] <+Grayhammatter> a hitlist
[2:56:02] <+healnavi> dont worry about the hunting log its useless
[2:56:06] <%tigerfang86> Lances are COOL

[2:56:13] <%asakura_ayase> Sally forth
[2:56:15] <%Jackgar> @healnavi Not quite. It's awesome for exp
[2:56:18] <+Noeralf31> under that meter at the very bottom, on the left
[2:56:22] <buddhistmetal> you can get to 5 by doing the hunting log EZ
[2:56:26] <+BestTeaMaker> @healnavi not true, they're useful for early levels
[2:56:28] <Azathotic> Hunting logs aren't useless you get quite a bit of EXP at start from them
[2:56:31] <%Jackgar> Granted, levelling up is trivially easy in ARR now, but still
[2:56:35] <%Dakuu75> Rip and tear... until it is done...
[2:56:39] <%JenovasPuppet> Is the next MSQ unlocked yet?
[2:56:44] <cobalt_phoenix_> hunting log is a good xp boost for early levels til dungeons
[2:56:54] <Sameriarix> RIP "Please try rear heavy thrust" messages
[2:56:56] <Monkeyweed21> items arent a big deal in fights
[2:56:57] <%Jackgar> @JenovasPuppet Yeah she just hasn't gone to it yet
[2:57:13] <Monkeyweed21> kill stuff and get lots of xp
[2:57:17] <+Noeralf31> KAR EN TUK
[2:57:17] <cobalt_phoenix_> oh also don't forget to eat
[2:57:35] <%Jackgar> Basically that just means "See that icon? Kill things with that icon until they stop having that icon for BIG EXP"
[2:57:39] <%QueequegTheater> To the bannock
[2:57:40] <%Dakuu75> The only time I feel like playing XIV is when I'm watching someone else play it
[2:57:43] <%JenovasPuppet> Back to Mommy!
[2:57:49] <+Noeralf31> hee hee hee doody
[2:58:00] <CrimsonCore90> Did I miss it?
[2:58:01] <RushUnplugged> against Paige's every instinct, random murder is NOT the main source of xp
[2:58:02] <+LastHazzerd> cuuuuuute
[2:58:12] <+FancyFishies> Nope
[2:58:13] <+healnavi> she needs to do a sidequest

[2:58:25] <zerointelligence000> no she didn't accept the new one
[2:58:28] <afronooch> thats completed
[2:58:34] <%JenovasPuppet> There is no active MSQ right now. Gotta pick it up.
[2:58:34] <DrkJP520> She doesn't have one
[2:58:35] <%blue8moon> she was 2, you have to be 3
[2:58:36] <cobalt_phoenix_> it hasn't been started yet
[2:58:40] <DrStinkers> Never picked up the follow up quest
[2:58:42] <+SammyOVision> She's in the completed section
[2:58:46] <buddhistmetal> she hasn't picked it up bc she's not high level enough
[2:58:47] <Monkeyweed21> just go to her
[2:58:57] <iosephe> it's a level 4 quest

[2:59:37] <%SenorCounter> Welcome to MMOs
[2:59:37] <$Sphincter_Spelunker> controller isn't intuitive
[2:59:38] <%MrBorisMakarov> you're also new it's fine
[2:59:38] <$NitronStreams> You are very sane
[2:59:39] <%JenovasPuppet> Aetherytes are friends
[2:59:40] <%Chichen> No, completely normal. It's overwhelming.
[2:59:40] <cobalt_phoenix_> it's a lot to take in
[2:59:40] <+FancyFishies> You are unfamiliar with the map
[2:59:42] <%Faustgesicht> Hunting log is a great way to get through the early levels
[2:59:43] <%Jackgar> If you've never played an MMO before ever, there's a LOT of new stuff you will have to get used to
[2:59:44] <+Grayhammatter> welcome to MMOs
[2:59:45] <+pilgrimsayswhat> YEh MURDER
[2:59:49] <Monkeyweed21> MMOs are hard to get used to
[2:59:49] <+healnavi> she could also do a tutorial quest but that might confuse her
[2:59:52] <Zeikier> gameplay's a little scuffed, yeah
[2:59:54] <%skm742> it feels like info overload, yeah.
[2:59:58] <%Jackgar> And honestly this is one of the most newbie-friendly MMO's out there
[3:00:02] <@SoFarFetched> yes'
[3:00:04] <@StridentSong> That's Fetched
[3:00:07] <@Jekado> Fetch is chicken yeah
[3:00:08] <%SveriSageAdvice> MMOs are a bit confusing, i had a rough time adjusting at first to FFXIV after swapping to it from WoW
[3:00:08] <%Jackgar> ARISE CHICKEN
[3:00:09] <Monkeyweed21> my sister had these same problems getting into this
[3:00:10] <Kain5707> chmkn
[3:00:10] <%JenovasPuppet> The Chicken knows best
[3:00:14] <Srthunda> the map in this game is not great
[3:00:14] <%cade_calrayn> Who else would it be? hahaha
[3:00:20] <Zeikier> technically farfetch'd is duck 4Head
[3:00:23] <%Estuko> @SveriSageAdvice you're telling me, I came from Mabinogi haha
[3:00:23] <+Noeralf31> controller stuff feels more convoluted but that's because all the keyboard keys' stuff has to get condensed into the much smaller amount of controller buttons
[3:00:25] <%Ranryu692> you're probably going to have to add some people as friends after this stream lol
[3:00:25] <+KingpinLarry> I need to get back in this. It's been 2 months for me and I basically paying to just pay at this point.
[3:00:27] <+tactician0> paige you can take a whole year to finish a one quest if you wanted
[3:00:30] <+tomdwarf> Yeah, UI tends to be comprehensive, and confusing.

[3:07:04] <%Dakuu75> (I accidentally dipped my beard in my soup)
[3:07:06] <+FancyFishies> Those lil waves above the monsters heads will give you gold and exp if you kill enough of them,
[3:07:11] <TheYellowcouch> Nah SPAM BUTTON
[3:07:14] <%strakillias> I can't unsee how much the target indicator looks like a butt plug
[3:07:14] <TheYellowcouch> It's what we all do
[3:07:17] <%Jackgar> Oh trust me, you'll thank God for those 2.5 seconds eventually!
[3:07:20] <tubit> mmmmm... soup beard...
[3:07:22] <%DianaTheAscian> your gonna appreciate it alter on
[3:07:29] <@Jekado> ITS THE ATB SYSTEM!
[3:07:30] <%DianaTheAscian> later*
[3:07:43] <Kain5707> when you have a 2.4 GCD shit gets nuts
[3:07:50] <$Sphincter_Spelunker> learn 👏 your 👏 rotations 👏
[3:07:51] <buddhistmetal> it helps to think of it as ATB like, yeah
[3:07:52] <%Garthunox> dont wait, weave
[3:07:53] <%Jackgar> The shroom dropped shrooms!
[3:07:53] <@thenefftw> As long as Paige can hit the enemy and try to avoid the AoEs, she'll be set
[3:07:57] <%JenovasPuppet> You can continue your combo on a different enemy.
[3:08:01] <+RandyFistburgers> Same with apex
[3:08:01] <%Chichen> @PeachSaliva this isnt' competitive, so people are kinder.
[3:08:04] <%SveriSageAdvice> the FFXIV community is super friendly to new players
[3:08:04] <Monkeyweed21> the closest comparison would be FF12
[3:08:05] <%Dakuu75> this is an eventful moment in the Saliva-Lore
[3:08:07] <Valdorick> Its not a wholesome community
[3:08:08] <tanarath> Nah, ffxiv is super great
[3:08:10] <%Jackgar> I mean that's the difference between a pvp game and a mostly coop game, yeah?
[3:08:15] <+Masked_Hero_Lucky> The people following you around are so well behaved, it's kind of surprising
[3:08:22] <%DianaTheAscian> This is a co op game tbf
[3:08:22] <+BaldRex> the community is my favorite part besides the story and gameplay
[3:08:29] <+healnavi> People can get really fucking rude dont worry knijohLan
[3:08:30] <%Jackgar> YOU. DID IT.
[3:08:30] <AdmiralButtloaf> do you want us to bully you?
[3:08:30] <%Garthunox> Get fucked kiddo
[3:08:32] <%Estuko> my first game as killer in DBD all 4 survivors tbagged and taunted the entire match lol that was something
[3:08:32] <+Noeralf31> PogChamp
[3:08:34] <buddhistmetal> level 5 POG

[3:08:43] <+Grayhammatter> bigger, AND stronger
[3:08:45] <TheYellowcouch> Learning!
[3:08:46] <%Jackgar> Oh man, wait until you get Jump!
[3:08:46] <+Mekhet09> @peachsaliva  people can turn south with rades
[3:08:47] <DrkJP520> You can turn off the annoying "Not ready yet" alert sound, if you'd like
[3:08:49] <DrillStopsNoCops> Oh yeah, I read that you were gonna try this!
[3:08:55] <buddhistmetal> eventually you won't even have to look
[3:08:59] <@Jekado> FFXIV can be the most chill stress game out there...
[3:09:00] <%Jackgar> The PP gets SO BIG
[3:09:05] <FishSkeleton> big bunny dumptrucks
[3:09:12] <zerointelligence000> this game is easy to get addicted to and you have a really welcoming community
[3:09:17] <%cherrysavestheuniverse> I've played this game for 5 years and mindlessly pushing buttons weirdly doesn't get old sometimes.
[3:09:22] <%blue8moon> there's voice acting, but not a ton in ARR
[3:09:25] <%SenorCounter> leveling everyone is nice in MMOs usually, endgame is where people get irritable
[3:09:28] <%TheWinged7> bnnuy booty
[3:09:36] <%Jackgar> There's a LOT of text. They get better about doing voice over with every expansion, but ARR is BIG TEXT READS
[3:09:36] <+Terrah48> bun are best >3
[3:09:37] <%Ranryu692> @PeachSaliva are you drinking anything with electrolytes? My mum has had a dry mouth for a year now and water with electrolytes are the only thing that have helped her
[3:09:40] <Mortal_Wombat_I> Yeah the moment to moment gameplay still feels pretty good to do mindlessly
[3:09:42] <Monkeyweed21> you can get 2b tights that make your butt bigger
[3:09:48] <%Puhff> Dont worry, whenever you get bored, you can just buy a level skip Kappa
[3:09:50] <%Estuko> Hope you're enjoying the MMO! I know it's fun to jump into your first/unfamiliar mmo game and watching you do it is a blast
[3:09:56] <LordDudeTheFirst> The VA in 2.0 is... not great
[3:09:56] <%MisterRockett> Paige Lancer becomes Dragoon.
[3:09:59] <Monkeyweed21> go with what you think is coolest
[3:10:02] <%Garthunox> Pat you should tell her to attune to the minis
[3:10:05] <Kain5707> does Paige know about ERP
[3:10:05] <viewtifulr> jump into aoe
[3:10:08] <%Jackgar> NEW UGLY BOOTS!
[3:10:10] <%barkon345> qell you picked the job that will become a Dragoon
[3:10:11] <Rumbutt> Level 5 LNC, already headed to erp
[3:10:11] <%JenovasPuppet> @MisterRockett She definitely meant to say Au Ra
[3:10:21] <+Mekhet09> Don't be a thief. it'll be too much for you.
[3:10:27] <%cade_calrayn> So this is what Paige is like in an MMO, isn't it. She gets distracted by all the random hotties
[3:10:28] <tanarath> @kain5707 she reads sonic high school every year
[3:10:31] <%Jackgar> You can get the ugliest, hookeriest boots of all in this game
[3:10:37] <Dopamien> could be worse, could skip arr then get confused about whats happening later lol
[3:10:39] <Monkeyweed21> every class is a reference to a different FF character, so go with whatever you like
[3:10:42] <Kain5707> @tanarath i know thats why i asked
[3:10:46] <TheYellowcouch> speak to boy
[3:10:47] <+Grayhammatter> thanks momther
[3:10:50] <FishSkeleton> Dragoon is stupidly fun, you turn into a living blender animation wise once you get the spinny Heavensward moves
[3:10:53] <+Grayhammatter> speak to ywain
[3:10:55] <%JenovasPuppet> Just not the sidequests!
[3:11:15] <%Ranryu692> yeah, it's a Final Fantasy game
[3:11:20] <BobbyHopp> fashion is the real endgame of XIV
[3:11:22] <%Agami23> yeah, you can learn to play music by playing a specific class, its great
[3:11:24] <Valdorick> Final Fashiony is the real endgame
[3:11:25] <%Jackgar> @PeachSaliva There's a saying in this game: Fashion is the true Endgame
[3:11:25] <afronooch> fashion is the endgame
[3:11:27] <$NitronStreams> Fashion Fantasy 14
[3:11:27] <Aeonknight_87> paige walking around saying hello to everyone is precious
[3:11:27] <guyman125> it is called glamors and it is the true endgame
[3:11:29] <%Jackgar> Although housing, too
[3:11:31] <+AmanisHouseOfNonsense> There's a lot of good outfits and designs
[3:11:37] <%Dakuu75> everyone is so perfect... (it's disgusting really) Kappa
[3:11:39] <TheYellowcouch> Be attractive, Be E attractive
[3:11:40] <Mortal_Wombat_I> Fashion Fantasy is the truest engame
[3:11:49] <senorpapel> Fashion is where it’s at. Wait until you start creating outfits for different occasions and based around weapons
[3:11:56] <tubit> your fashion must be smashin
[3:11:57] <xxshadowxx416> fashion is the olny true endgame in mmos
[3:11:57] <$Sphincter_Spelunker> when do you get a mount
[3:11:59] <amritadyne> oh no what has pat done to you
[3:12:00] <Kain5707> lalaJam
[3:12:03] <%Jackgar> Pat with his goofy hat
[3:12:05] <Basch71> as max says, it not about getting gud, its about looking gud
[3:12:07] <Rumbutt> lalaJAM
[3:12:11] <+Noeralf31> lmao
[3:12:12] <%JenovasPuppet> Yeah! Trash gear!
[3:12:14] <+RandyFistburgers> LUL
[3:12:16] <%Jackgar> Time to earn some actual armor!
[3:12:16] <%blue8moon> he even has his own zangief in game
[3:12:18] <%Puhff> LUL
[3:12:25] <%flagi64> @PeachSaliva honestly, I suggest potentially looking at videos of other classes or play through the "role tutorials" (you unlock this later) to maybe get a better look at all of the classes available. It helped me out a lot to see what I wanted to do in the game. If you just wanna just have fun with experimenting that's always a blast.
[3:12:31] <$NitronStreams> Pat is enjoying the stream sniper experience
[3:12:38] <erodahs> You say everyone looks perfect... but you haven't seen my big pink Hrothgar in the 2b leggings and just a bunny head....
[3:12:41] <%Jackgar> The courage to jump into a boss' AOE indicator without doing mechanics and die
[3:12:53] <Solidus_113> LUL
[3:13:05] <FishSkeleton> we all need to give Paige the big donations if she graduates from the Hall of the Novice around level 15
[3:13:16] <%Dakuu75> Paige will NEVER panic, guys... neva-eva~
[3:13:18] <FishSkeleton> big proof of the not stupid
[3:13:20] <Kain5707> become a true gamer and ask where da EELs are
[3:13:24] <%Jackgar> Fuck yarzons, all my homies hate yarzons
[3:13:26] <TheYellowcouch> The neighbouring city to Yharnam
[3:13:41] <%Sotetsu> Sotetsu subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 7 months! Love you, Paige! Gridania is the best!
[3:13:43] <+Pendragon3d> Cant wait for Paige to just YEET off Titan's arena
[3:13:56] <TheYellowcouch> Yeah but poetry
[3:14:01] <+Isoterica> but the flavor
[3:14:01] <DrkJP520> Did you watch the cinematic intro to ARR?
[3:14:04] <Clyderso> pap
[3:14:05] <%JenovasPuppet> That's literally how it is in the Japanese version
[3:14:08] <+healnavi> she didnt
[3:14:14] <+Noeralf31> FF14 will take every opportunity to pad stuff out, you'll see
[3:14:21] <+Grayhammatter> do both
[3:14:27] <NireFuster> Oh cool I'm finally on time to catch a stream! I know nothing of FFXIV but I'll stick around anyways, love the character
[3:14:28] <%Jackgar> Oh god, did she attune to the plaza aetheryte?
[3:14:32] <FishSkeleton> ohh I wanna see her check out the Answes intro, good point
[3:14:32] <@SoFarFetched> yes
[3:14:37] <%Jackgar> Okay, phew
[3:14:41] <TheYellowcouch> it's outside
[3:14:41] <%Jackgar> I figured it was required
[3:14:42] <LovableSemi> of course paige would pick the class with a "put self in danger" button
[3:14:54] <Aeonknight_87> if you click on the quest in the list to the right, it'll show you where it's located on the map
[3:14:55] <%Jackgar> You can find out where the Bannock is by checking the quest info
[3:14:57] <%JenovasPuppet> It's where you logged in
[3:14:57] <@SoFarFetched> she'll be fine if she does
[3:14:58] <@SoFarFetched> dies*
[3:15:02] <Monkeyweed21> L2+Y is sprint btw
[3:15:04] <TheYellowcouch> Oh wait you should buy a hat

[3:15:24] <+sixcubit> god i love gridania but i can't stand its music

[3:15:29] <%JenovasPuppet> She was going straight there before Pat gave directions LUL

[3:15:33] <+healnavi> no, west
[3:15:38] <%flagi64> i assume paige is wearing the leveling items or was that only a pre-order thing?
[3:15:40] <+Mekhet09> why can't they make spirit indefinite outside of combat?
[3:15:48] <+RandyFistburgers> Weast
[3:15:48] <erodahs> well that certainly didn't work ><
[3:15:51] <cherrycottontail> click on the blue text part of the quest
[3:15:53] <Srthunda> agree
[3:15:54] <cherrycottontail> it will take you there
[3:15:55] <CappuccinoGuil> FF14 map is THE FUCKING WORST
[3:15:56] <%Jackgar> Take the same exit you took earlier
[3:16:03] <%Jackgar> And then keep going south
[3:16:13] <%DianaTheAscian> I find them pretty simple to read
[3:16:17] <@Jekado> yeah this has a weird map system
[3:16:17] <Gloppie> Yeah I bounced off the game like twice because of the map. Eventually got used to it though
[3:16:30] <cobalt_phoenix_> bannock is  outside city
[3:16:51] <%Jackgar> Because it's on a different map

[3:26:01] <$SirGO0SE> baba
[3:26:06] <%QueequegTheater> @PeachSaliva Pat is wrong, just click on the nest

[3:26:39] <+FancyFishies> Go to purple gas use item
[3:26:45] <%Jackgar> Pat is getting ahead of himself. Just walk up to the nest
[3:26:54] <%DianaTheAscian> This is way a way more complicated way to do this
[3:26:57] <%Qexec> this is needlessly convoluted
[3:26:59] <CappuccinoGuil> @QueequegTheater what about quests where you have to do this on an enemy?
[3:27:00] <$Sphincter_Spelunker> atpCap
[3:27:01] <%miabyte> I gotta go to sleep so I will take my leave, but this has been super cute and most enjoyable. Welcome to Eorzea lovely!

[3:28:01] <%Puhff> no prob!
[3:28:03] <Mortal_Wombat_I> I’m just now realizing in horror that Paige is the same woman who leaves their menu up in Dark Souls… there WILL be growing pains
[3:28:03] <+Vampireinarm> @Qexec its really not at all, just needs more than 1 brain cell active
[3:28:06] <TheYellowcouch> You are an unstoppable killing god with us around
[3:28:06] <%QueequegTheater> Never do that again, chat.  She must learn the hard way
[3:28:16] <%BinaryFireball> if only I could get my dad to be there for me like you guys are there for peach
[3:28:18] <%Jackgar> If she dies, she dies
[3:28:18] <iosephe> healed for over 10000%

[3:28:48] <%lil_pudintater9> ohhhhh
[3:28:48] <$Sphincter_Spelunker> uh huh atpCap
[3:28:49] <+RandyFistburgers> Soulsbrain
[3:28:49] <Solidus_113> there is a lock-on function you can enable
[3:28:54] <NireFuster> dark souls muscle memory LUL
[3:28:54] <%Fooguwu> DRINK ESTUS PAIGE
[3:28:55] <Vermillion129> Soul brain
[3:28:57] <$SirGO0SE> drop your shield Kappa
[3:29:04] <Monkeyweed21> lock on is L3 in this game
[3:29:13] <CappuccinoGuil> Pat might've forgotten because he maps R3 to Sprint, right?
[3:29:20] <%walternatorz> wait, II never knew FATE stood for something
[3:29:26] <%skm742> souls brain broke me for any game that doesn't use B for dodge
[3:29:31] <%Jackgar> Super don't worry about FATEs for now
[3:29:37] <$Sphincter_Spelunker> fomo missions? wth
[3:29:40] <%Calek> @walternatorz it doesn't, the game likes to yell random words
[3:30:14] <CappuccinoGuil> @Monkeyweed21 I mean, would it be a good idea for her to swap it around, then? Put R3 as lock-on
[3:30:15] <SaphronBlackbourne> @Sphincter_Spelunker It's not that big of a deal. Most aren't even worth doing
[3:30:17] <%Puhff> the lil swirly above an enemy name means they give more XP
[3:30:38] <TheYellowcouch> Come on Paige! GET EM!
[3:30:44] <CappuccinoGuil> LEVEL 6, LIFE SURGE, YAY
[3:30:46] <+RandyFistburgers> Big teamwerk
[3:30:47] <%Kenzo2000> Team effort
[3:30:48] <%Puhff> NEW MOVE
[3:30:53] <%Jackgar> New move!
[3:31:34] <iosephe> it crits
[3:31:38] <afronooch> gives big damage
[3:31:39] <LaughingCatt> it powers up your next attack
[3:31:39] <CryoByjorne> buffs the next move you use
[3:31:39] <Manooz> literally what it says
[3:31:46] <%JenovasPuppet> It makes your hits even BIGGERER
[3:31:55] <%Chichen> you can click it between the two really fast
[3:31:56] <%blue8moon> number gets bigger when you crit
[3:31:56] <iosephe> beeg damage
[3:31:58] <CappuccinoGuil> Guaranteed CRITS
[3:32:01] <%lil_pudintater9> yeah more buttons to hit
[3:32:02] <+Cuon_Alpinus> she's a natural
[3:32:07] <$Sphincter_Spelunker> is there not a list of your abilities? Not sure I like new moves just showing up on the button map
[3:32:13] <cobalt_phoenix_> ay she even saved it for the bigger attack
[3:32:14] <TheYellowcouch> I love how since we can't see the actual move tip it just looks like you mouse over and hte info beams over into your brain
[3:32:14] <%JenovasPuppet> Paige just intuitively figured that out.
[3:32:18] <%Jackgar> This is also a skill that doesn't care about that 2.5 second cooldown. So you can use it between attacks.
[3:32:22] <+Cuon_Alpinus> @Sphincter_Spelunker there is
[3:32:34] <Manooz> @Sphincter_Spelunker There is but new moves will be auto put on
[3:32:39] <buddhistmetal> honestly impressed she figured out to use it on the bigger hit :D
[3:32:53] <+Cuon_Alpinus> paige has da INTUITION
[3:33:17] <+Mekhet09> it gets much worse with more skills. @peachsaliva
[3:33:20] <CappuccinoGuil> For as instance as this game can get, I will always take my hat off to how beginner friendly it can be
[3:33:22] <%Jackgar> So they're in different rooms?
[3:33:27] <Solidus_113> video game become life
[3:33:28] <TheYellowcouch> PLAY MORE
[3:33:28] <cobalt_phoenix_> it begiiiiiins
[3:33:28] <+RandyFistburgers> The sun is down

[3:33:39] <%lil_pudintater9> THIS GAME IS CRACK PAIGE
[3:33:39] <%Agami23> you lost track of time
[3:33:39] <SlagChambers> As you get further you get more stuff to do during combat. When I first played combat felt really slow and with not much too do
[3:33:40] <%abakkus> YEEAAAHHHH
[3:33:41] <%Chichen> DATS AN MMO

[3:33:54] <%Ranryu692> you can feel the future days disappearing
[3:33:54] <UvBenServed> Time flies when you're doing crack
[3:33:54] <Aeonknight_87> MMO's are time vampires
[3:33:56] <+Noeralf31> timesucc
[3:33:57] <Drunknflayer> yep sounds like an mmo
[3:33:58] <$Sphincter_Spelunker> You started around an hour and half into the stream
[3:34:00] <Mortal_Wombat_I> Yep, you’re in the game now
[3:34:00] <+ALazo> be consoomed
[3:34:02] <Slimeking_Mike> Give your time a real sloppy one
[3:34:02] <%Jackgar> Some dude literally died playing Everquest back in the day because he never stopped
[3:34:05] <+megaman_sentinel> it's MMO has taken her
[3:34:07] <%Ranryu692> it's been 84 years
[3:34:08] <guyman125> literal hundreds of hours of gameplay
[3:34:09] <+ratearth> The summer of 2020 I basically nonstop logged FFXIV
[3:34:11] <%walternatorz> paige is now affected by the MMO time distortion bubble
[3:34:14] <$Sphincter_Spelunker> so only 2 hours
[3:34:15] <+healnavi> You'll wake up two years later
[3:34:18] <+fromnibelheim> ffxiv is the best time sink
[3:34:19] <Monkeyweed21> L2 and Y is sprint btw @PeachSaliva
[3:34:23] <+tomdwarf> Yeah, the insane people.
[3:34:30] <atsu333> You have ADD like me, you basically want to plan on not doing anything else for the rest of the day when you launch this.
[3:34:40] <+SiameseDuck> Hey Peach how's FF14 going
[3:34:42] <%abakkus> ive been playing for a year and my in game playtime is something like 150 days lmao
[3:34:43] <Guardiansaiyan> @atsu333 same!
[3:34:43] <+Mekhet09> they wouldn't sleep and get a heartattack.
[3:34:46] <%NPC_Mimic> no, they just put some fig jam up in there
[3:34:46] <%X2Eliah> Well not anymore, now they get 1 hour a day max LUL
[3:34:49] <+ratearth> There was a boss in FF 11 that had attempts that could last 30+ hours
[3:34:50] <Guardiansaiyan> ADHD REPRESENT! VirtualHug <3 VirtualHug <3
[3:34:52] <%Chichen> Paige, you have done *fantastic* today
[3:34:54] <cobalt_phoenix_> you're doing great
[3:34:54] <+Kise77> are you gonna try to catch up to play endwalker with Pat?
[3:35:09] <Solidus_113> you gotta be lvl 15 to do it
[3:35:11] <%other_badger> endwalker's a looooong way off
[3:35:12] <%walternatorz> you gotta make it to another city
[3:35:15] <%Jackgar> @ratearth You mean Absolute Virtue, the boss who would always get patched whenever someone beat it?
[3:35:15] <Solidus_113> sept 9th iirc
[3:35:18] <Aeonknight_87> @PeachSaliva you're doing fine.  MMO's can be very overwhelming up front, but you're processing it all
[3:35:19] <@JustinianKnight> thats why there are fireworks
[3:35:20] <%Kenzo2000> until the 9th
[3:35:21] <%Jackgar> And speaking of which, there's the pet version...
[3:35:22] <%other_badger> long way in game, I mean
[3:35:24] <2DSuperiority> you get an umbrella out of it too
[3:35:29] <%other_badger> endwalker's a devilishly short way off irl
[3:35:33] <%Ranryu692> is there a bunch of free shit like in gacha games?
[3:35:48] <%Jackgar> @Ranryu692 It is not like gacha
[3:35:53] <@JustinianKnight> there is free shit but this game isnt very gatcha
[3:35:57] <%Jackgar> I'm not sure what you mean by free shit, though
[3:36:00] <%zamatermort> Do big pokes
[3:36:04] <%Jackgar> But you know what IS free?
[3:36:05] <2DSuperiority> and you have to earn stuff
[3:36:08] <Monkeyweed21> @Ranryu692 mostly cosmetic stuff like a parasol, fireworks, champaigne etc
[3:36:30] <%Jackgar> The free trial that lets you play up to level 60, including the entire base game and the award-winning expansions Heavensward, with no limit on playtime
[3:36:31] <+sashagreenspiderqueen> oh shit paige is a vtuber now
[3:36:35] <+sashagreenspiderqueen> THE EARS so cute

[3:38:22] <cobalt_phoenix_> and once you have all of em you can use them to go right outside
[3:38:25] <TheYellowcouch> this is how we always were faster than you lol
[3:38:29] <%JenovasPuppet> Techmology!
[3:38:30] <iosephe> now you're thinking with aetherytes

[3:39:56] <+Tarage> Oh god
[3:40:10] <$ZeOrbling> i feel vindicated seeing pat wear the sephirot DRK sword
[3:40:19] <Monkeyweed21> I really want to get back in to 14 but the people I play with had a baby and they cant play
[3:40:21] <%Puhff> Damn Pat how many DRK glams do you have?

[3:40:42] <+Tarage> @PeachSaliva when the expansion comes out are you gonna gender change into one of those twink male buns?
[3:40:51] <%walternatorz> you need 160+ hours and MSQ progression
[3:40:51] <TheYellowcouch> Crack is good
[3:40:53] <FalseKingAki> you can remove it if you want
[3:40:54] <@SoFarFetched> yeah I beat ARR in a month.
[3:40:58] <valanway_slash> 168 hours played to lose the sprout iirc
[3:41:02] <@SoFarFetched> but that was like 10-12 hours a day I think.

[4:01:19] <DrkJP520> It's almost like your character doesn't know what can be seen.
[4:01:42] <%JenovasPuppet> Costs big monies

[4:02:04] <%sandrews> wow she  loads fast
[4:02:04] <TheYellowcouch> you're close
[4:02:05] <+Noeralf31> RATHALOS
[4:02:09] <Mortal_Wombat_I> She’s doing it!!
[4:02:16] <buddhistmetal> bentbranch, bannock is north
[4:02:16] <Vermillion129> LUL
[4:02:22] <%Nobrev> a little more north ways
[4:02:25] <RogueMinja> Northeast.
[4:02:30] <%Jackgar> Buy armor
[4:02:32] <superdude22> hit da best gear button
[4:02:33] <TheYellowcouch> you need the headpiece
[4:02:33] <T_Sasquatch> Is it backseat time ?
[4:02:34] <+Hilleltaco> Still got a couple of unfilled slots
[4:02:34] <+Tarage> Ah yes, the woman using a cat girl animated avatar is a nerd. Who would have guessed?
[4:02:35] <buddhistmetal> she needs a lvl 5 head hands and legs
[4:02:36] <+DreyfussFrost> The only thing you need is a head piece.
[4:02:39] <+Masked_Hero_Lucky> Just go buy some ilvl 5 gear
[4:02:45] <%JenovasPuppet> Yeah it's 3. Half the slots are ilvl 0!
[4:02:45] <@Jekado> doesn't paige have the mehpina earings?
[4:02:46] <TheYellowcouch> You can do it
[4:02:48] <@SoFarFetched> gonna give her items LUL
[4:02:49] <NevikGamina> just go to the vendor in this zone and buy the armor/weapon there
[4:02:49] <buddhistmetal> there should be a vendor nearby?
[4:02:51] <Monkeyweed21> @PeachSaliva there's a merchant near the quest
[4:02:57] <%Chichen> Did pat steal my glam to give to paige
[4:03:02] <%DianaTheAscian> does she have them?
[4:03:03] <+DreyfussFrost> There's a vendor just a couple steps from the quest, yeah.
[4:03:14] <+Tarage> Don't worry about it.
[4:03:18] <$Sphincter_Spelunker> so where does a normal person get money from if they also run into this problem?
[4:03:20] <%rumtumtugnutz> @Tarageshe's a foxgirl, but otherwise u right
[4:03:28] <superdude22> Pat is trying to be a good boyfriend
[4:03:36] <%randoli_spugoli> this is a pretty cute brb tbh
[4:03:40] <+Tarage> Fiancee.
[4:03:46] <shinji_ifrit> @Sphincter_Spelunker just do some sidequests, you can get a lot of gil early
[4:03:46] <superdude22> my bad, you're right
[4:03:52] <NevikGamina> @Sphincter_Spelunker iirc the MSQ up to this point gives you just enough gil to complete this quest
[4:03:58] <Mortal_Wombat_I> @sphincter_spelunker the quests offer more than enough Gil, otherwise you can just sell monster trash for enough
[4:03:59] <%Kenzo2000> MSQ pays well, or you can run dungeons for gil, or take up a gathering job
[4:04:05] <cherrycottontail> @Sphincter_Spelunker buying level 5 gear costs nothing
[4:04:13] <$Sphincter_Spelunker> ah, right. I forgot she wasn't doing any sidequests
[4:04:16] <+Tarage> Have they streamlined the MSQ yet or is it still 20000 missions long?
[4:04:23] <superdude22> they streamlined it
[4:04:29] <%JaydenSai> @Tarage Streamlined it
[4:04:29] <%Kenzo2000> it's streamlined now
[4:04:31] <+Tarage> Thank god, it was a slog
[4:04:43] <Mortal_Wombat_I> @tarage they did streamline it, but people will still say it’s a slog. I appreciated it still
[4:04:47] <NevikGamina> @Tarage the've mostly trimmed down the Titan build-up and post-ARR, so still kinda long but not as tedious
[4:04:53] <+Hilleltaco> The took like 20 quests off it I think
[4:05:02] <%DianaTheAscian> Its like 30% less of a slog now
[4:05:06] <+Tarage> It's just the beginning parts that were tedious.
[4:05:09] <%Kenzo2000> yeah, I had a friend go through the ARR patches in like three days  it took me a month
[4:05:10] <shinji_ifrit> the whole Titan part is still just the worst even though they shortened it
[4:05:14] <RushUnplugged> don't you also have an aetherite at the waking sands now??
[4:05:19] <+Tarage> I say this as I am literally playing FFXI right now...
[4:05:27] <+Hilleltaco> No aetheryte but there are tickets to teleport there
[4:05:34] <NevikGamina> @RushUnplugged still no Aetheryte there sadly
[4:05:46] <RushUnplugged> oh it's been forever for me but I heard stuff about it lol
[4:05:47] <+Tarage> Ah Waking Sands... the place that was cool till the story moved on and then you never go there again...
[4:05:53] <Monkeyweed21> @RushUnplugged they give you teleport tickets to waking sands
[4:05:57] <Mortal_Wombat_I> You can also just take a boat straight there from Limsa

[4:14:31] <%Kenzo2000> it's a pretty solid game even songle player
[4:14:33] <T_Sasquatch> You'll make friends eventually
[4:14:38] <+Tarage> @RD_NX This game is one of the most "I have no friends" friendly MMO games.
[4:14:38] <%other_badger> @RD_NX The story's really good and you can do most content with randos if you want
[4:14:40] <cobalt_phoenix_> @RD_NX speaking as someone who doesn't know anyone else, i'd say hell yeah at least for all the non super hard stuff
[4:14:41] <%sandrews> @RD_NX Yes story is really good too
[4:14:43] <%Estuko> @RD_NX This game is Final Fantasy first (RPG) multiplayer stuff is fetched for you in party quests :)
[4:14:45] <T_Sasquatch> I play mostly solo
[4:14:47] <%ORGANizerC> @T_Sasquatch bold claims
[4:14:48] <+Tarage> You don't gotta know no one.
[4:15:08] <%ORGANizerC> become lalafell to make million friends
[4:15:10] <+Tarage> You can queue up with some randos and never ever see them again.
[4:15:16] <$Sphincter_Spelunker> @RD_NX people are generally helpful if you say you're new.
[4:15:21] <%JenovasPuppet> Achievement Unlocked: Put on Pants
[4:15:24] <Mortal_Wombat_I> Yeah I appreciate that this game feels like a 400+ hour single player final fantasy in a really good way, PLUS mmo fun stuff added in there
[4:15:28] <+RD_NX> thanks guys, you make the decision easy :)

[4:16:09] <TheYellowcouch> We call them steroid cats in my friend group
[4:16:13] <%cade_calrayn> oh god can you imagine if Zangief could fly.... the chaos he would cause
[4:16:31] <%JenovasPuppet> It is very hard to make an unattractive character in this game.
[4:16:31] <%DianaTheAscian> falling slime
[4:16:37] <%Jackgar> @cade_calrayn I mean apparently he flew right into Peach the other day when she was trying to give him a back massage
[4:16:38] <%SuckerPunchSyd> @cade_calrayn no food would be safe
[4:16:44] <Lone_Xeno> if zangief could fly, pat and paige would die of starvation
[4:16:50] <%blue8moon> that one male au ra face is hard to make nice tho

[4:18:19] <Lone_Xeno> Imagine playing with the crossbar....
[4:18:21] <T_Sasquatch> You did it
[4:18:25] <+Tarage> Big hand eye coordination
[4:18:26] <luftraumm1> hey chat how's peaches getting along?
[4:18:27] <%Estuko> :)
[4:18:27] <$Sphincter_Spelunker> atpCap
[4:18:33] <%JenovasPuppet> Oh man, controller for very first MMO is such a bad idea.
[4:18:36] <%DianaTheAscian> shes doing good
[4:18:36] <%Estuko> You're getting it Paige no worries
[4:18:46] <qu3kl41n_the_impure_king> for some reason Pat sounds like he did way back in the Machinima days
[4:18:53] <%Dakuu75> is it possible to unlock the camera when you fly? (so you don't always go in the direction the camera is pointing?)
[4:18:56] <T_Sasquatch> Controller in ffxiv is pretty good
[4:19:02] <%DianaTheAscian> Its fine this game was designed for controllers
[4:19:05] <Lone_Xeno> I would probably pull my hair out if i had to play with a controller
[4:19:06] <luftraumm1> controller for xiv is great
[4:19:06] <Ks201> i did not know you could do that
[4:19:07] <jackythefrost> @JenovasPuppet XIV was specifically made for controllers
[4:19:08] <wasdsf> do you see what i mean
[4:19:08] <%other_badger> eh xiv with contreoller's good it just has a little more abstraction
[4:19:09] <+Tarage> Peach is being big and strong
[4:19:34] <+Tarage> Go under waterfall
[4:19:45] <%WebmanJax> Other side of the river.
[4:19:47] <mythrilcrafter> I just realised that I haven't played since the 5.4 update, the rust is gonna be so real when I get back in....
[4:19:49] <buddhistmetal> waterfall
[4:19:52] <Monkeyweed21> the game will take it easy on you for a while, so take it at your own pace
[4:19:52] <iosephe> go through waterfall
[4:20:00] <+FancyFishies> Those lil waves above the monsters heads will give you gold and exp if you kill enough of them,
[4:20:02] <shinji_ifrit> @Lone_Xeno it's a matter of preference, you can be really good at this game with either KBM or gamepad
[4:20:09] <rasamune> man he wasn't doin nothin to ya
[4:20:23] <T_Sasquatch> Might wanna tell her about her gcd combo LUL
[4:20:26] <%Jackgar> HONK

[4:20:33] <Ks201> also if you hold lb and move your right stick youll some out a little so you can see more of the world around you
[4:20:36] <%nip_nips> west side of the river
[4:20:36] <%Jackgar> There's a ramp next to the waterfall
[4:20:36] <T_Sasquatch> Loooool
[4:20:36] <luftraumm1> lancer is a pretty good job to learn stuff
[4:20:39] <@SoFarFetched> no above
[4:20:41] <@SoFarFetched> one guy lied
[4:20:53] <buddhistmetal> sorry up the cliff
[4:20:55] <+Tarage> I thought it was through the waterfall. My bad.
[4:21:06] <Lone_Xeno> @shinji_ifrit Once you've learned one way, switching is almost impossible tho
[4:21:16] <%DianaTheAscian> they are like a yellow brick road
[4:21:25] <luftraumm1> does she have an entourage?
[4:21:29] <@SoFarFetched> ye
[4:21:31] <@SoFarFetched> we are here
[4:21:33] <OneThousandTomatoes> so strong now

[4:23:57] <@JustinianKnight> theyre voiced a little bit later on too
[4:23:59] <%other_badger> I guess GKMM's song has moogle voices
[4:23:59] <demiiluna> Remember if a Kuplo Kopp asks you where you're going you don't have to answer him.
[4:24:03] <%alternative_flu> Tom Clancy's Final Fantasy

[4:24:28] <TheYellowcouch> If they're a Kuplo Kopp they have to tell you
[4:24:31] <jackythefrost> Issue is these are good VA's, they were just directed very poorly, these were all done in ONE TAKE
[4:24:31] <Dova573> Lalafel going Darl
[4:24:33] <Dova573> dark
[4:24:34] <%Nobrev> sam riegel was a decent alph
[4:24:35] <%blue8moon> angery tree
[4:24:36] <%Jackgar> @JenovasPuppet Yeah I kind of miss them, actually
[4:24:39] <+Tarage> BIG LAG TREE
[4:24:42] <%BoxNavy> monkaS
[4:24:46] <%vance168> I like how by now we all have masters degrees in aetherology as players lol

[4:24:50] <%cade_calrayn> KILL TREE PAIGE
[4:24:53] <+SkyfireHero> At it’s the Pat and Paige of the game
[4:24:56] <+Tarage> MURDER NATURE
[4:24:58] <Lone_Xeno> This is what happens when you dont hug the trees...
[4:25:03] <$Sphincter_Spelunker> imma punch it
[4:25:11] <%cade_calrayn> You got this!
[4:25:15] <mythrilcrafter> "the slightest distrubance to the aetheric flow and this happens...." welcome to the first half of the White Mage story line...
[4:25:18] <TheYellowcouch> Murdur tree
[4:25:19] <%JenovasPuppet> Stab tree!
[4:25:19] <%other_badger> oh nooooooo
[4:25:20] <+Tarage> Go full Minecraft Steve
[4:25:24] <%other_badger> she doesn't know how to weaver
[4:25:24] <+Selmassian> Man i forgot what they sounded like in ARR
[4:25:27] <%vance168> Nature is pissed
[4:25:36] <%Agami23> oh no
[4:25:37] <%other_badger> paaaaaaaaaaaaaaaat teach her weaving
[4:25:57] <luftraumm1> weaving can wait
[4:25:59] <Solidus_113> she might have to adjust what gets targeted when the weapon is out
[4:26:01] <+Tarage> @other_badger She's waaaay too new for that
[4:26:04] <%GalacticaPhanto> @other_badger what weaving? she only has 2 moves and lance charge
[4:26:04] <demiiluna> It might help to zoom out/change the camera angle
[4:26:06] <Lone_Xeno> Its fine
[4:26:08] <@JustinianKnight> getting used to targeting is the most important atm
[4:26:10] <%Jackgar> When you finish a combo, you have to start the combo over from the first move
[4:26:13] <Lone_Xeno> She'll get it
[4:26:13] <%BlackMage66652> Of course Paige picked the race with natural hooker boots
[4:26:14] <@JustinianKnight> other stuff is whatever
[4:26:14] <+DoctorDerp388> where the eeeeeels
[4:26:16] <%other_badger> the thingn is he TRIED to teach her
[4:26:18] <%Jackgar> So you have to alternate 1, 2, 1 ,2
[4:26:25] <+Rolandknight> Maybe she should try keyboard and mouse.
[4:26:28] <%Agami23> bo
[4:26:36] <+mariomarc> Paige do comob
[4:26:39] <DrkJP520> Alternate your attacks
[4:26:39] <TheYellowcouch> Kill the brushes to kill the oak
[4:26:42] <%JenovasPuppet> Why isn't Paige a top percentile raider yet? Where is her Ultimate clear??
[4:26:45] <demiiluna> You are doing this... 50% right, Paige.
[4:26:46] <%alternative_flu> poke em in the butt really hard
[4:26:47] <Lone_Xeno> She beat all the dark souls and bloodborne... She will learn how to do combo
[4:26:52] <AdmiralButtloaf> do combo
[4:26:52] <+Tarage> Big orange
[4:26:53] <OneThousandTomatoes> you can zoom out
[4:26:57] <%DianaTheAscian> oh god
[4:27:10] <+Tarage> Now we get to see if Paige can not stand in da orange
[4:27:15] <+wizard_of_diamonds> Paige chose Lancer!? The superior option for a superior woman!
[4:27:23] <%DianaTheAscian> did she lean about the orange yet?
[4:27:25] <+mariomarc> Paige, there is a combo system, please, it's just 1,2 right now
[4:27:26] <luftraumm1> does lancer/drg have positionals?
[4:27:27] <%Faustgesicht> anyone else getting graphic spikes or is that her?
[4:27:28] <Vermillion129> I see paige already training to be a floor tank by not dodging orange aoe
[4:27:34] <+Tarage> Orange big bad
[4:27:37] <demiiluna> Why did Paige choose lancer?
[4:27:38] <%sandrews> Congrats!
[4:27:38] <Lone_Xeno> OH!!!
[4:27:39] <NireFuster> You did it!
[4:27:41] <cobalt_phoenix_> you did it!
[4:27:41] <TheYellowcouch> You did ittt
[4:27:43] <iosephe> You did it!
[4:27:45] <%alternative_flu> you killed groot good job
[4:27:45] <Clyderso> Paige chose poke
[4:27:46] <@JustinianKnight> DRG has positionals but theyre not that hard
[4:27:49] <iosephe> orange is danger
[4:27:50] <+Tarage> Big AND strong
[4:27:50] <%nip_nips> you.. did it
[4:27:51] <cobalt_phoenix_> those are the hurty circles
[4:27:55] <%Kenzo2000> DRG has positionals later
[4:27:58] <+AmanisHouseOfNonsense> good night dudes, welcome to ff14 Paige!
[4:28:00] <%alternative_flu> wait actually I don't think that is groot she killed
[4:28:05] <Estwilde> There ya go, Paige! Alternate those two thrust attacks :) One combos into the other :)
[4:28:08] <$Sphincter_Spelunker> zoom out to see it better
[4:28:09] <luftraumm1> my guess is she chose lancer because of kain?
[4:28:14] <+Tarage> Time to hear, think, FEEL
[4:28:18] <Estwilde> 👏
[4:28:20] <T_Sasquatch> Mhmnmm meth

[4:28:27] <vVAstrAVv> youre supposed to notice it doing damage paige pol
[4:28:27] <+RandyFistburgers> That breaking bad crystal
[4:28:28] <Monkeyweed21> positionals arent a thing until you start playing in a party
[4:28:30] <Zeikier> yeah combat in this game has a lot of things where it won't tell you, which is kind of a bummer if you don't have a good coach
[4:28:36] <Lone_Xeno> Imagine trying to teach paige how to avoid the AOEs for aurum vale
[4:28:39] <%Jackgar> @TheEndlessRiver1 Not if you never played an MMO before

[4:41:17] <skewerstar> Oh wow Paige is getting into FFXIV!? Can't wait for the eventual FOR REAL Ruby Weapon hour! LUL
[4:41:19] <Clyderso> money
[4:41:19] <+DoctorDerp388> let me know when you hit the erp nightclubs
[4:41:20] <demiiluna> That is the new $30 mount that everyone is upset about/ super fucking hyped about because it's so sick.
[4:41:20] <%DianaTheAscian> Just never raid and you will have a pretty positive experience overall
[4:41:22] <tusk102> was that the alexander mount
[4:41:25] <Dapper_Cactuar> it's also a 2 person mount
[4:41:32] <+dawsfloss> I started playing ESO and someone have me 100k gold for no reason, ppl are nice in these to newbs
[4:41:32] <iosephe> center bottom
[4:41:39] <%walternatorz> Paige is slowly realizing what Pat is spending his money on
[4:41:42] <luftraumm1> compared to other communities it's pretty cool
[4:41:48] <%JenovasPuppet> You used to have to log out in the Inn for rested exp!
[4:41:50] <All_Salt> 30$ = mog station savage
[4:41:52] <Estwilde> Time for Paige to go whale on the store
[4:42:01] <NevikGamina> oh oh log out in the inn for a special animation
[4:42:02] <Toilet_Snake> there's a fun animation for logging out at an inn
[4:42:03] <@SoFarFetched> yeah you'll just come back on where you left
[4:42:04] <@JustinianKnight> if you log in an Inn you get a little cutscene
[4:42:06] <%walternatorz> you can get a room at an in and get a sleeping animation
[4:42:08] <Monkeyweed21> you CAN go to an inn iff you want
[4:42:13] <+Tarage> You can log out any time you like but you can NEVER leave!
[4:42:17] <tusk102> realm reborn red!
[4:42:20] <%JenovasPuppet> That was a ton of fun. Thanks for the stream!
[4:42:22] <+MoonObscure> xD
[4:42:23] <%encouraging_voice> doing it at an inn results in something cute though
[4:42:24] <SpaceCapnCrone> o7
[4:42:26] <Estwilde> yep moon is what you want to see before logging out 👍

[4:46:49] <SlagChambers> @PeachSaliva You should watch the ARR trailer if you haven't already

[4:47:24] <Valdorick> We are much nicer than Asmongold's audience.
[4:47:24] <+SiameseDuck> Don't worry Peach we'll let you die next time
[4:47:26] <%stoatacious> first impressions?
[4:47:26] <Aleate> Paige next stream: "So I did some grinding off stream..."
[4:47:26] <%Dakuu75> "Everybody gets one."
[4:47:33] <%Chichen> @PeachSaliva Glad you enjoyed the Peach Cosplay I was rocking earlier. I turned into the giant purple lady later.
[4:47:38] <NireFuster> <3 <3 <3
[4:47:46] <tusk102> yeaaaaaahhhh
[4:47:46] <$Sphincter_Spelunker> map suck
[4:47:48] <luftraumm1> pleasant is a good descriptor
[4:48:02] <Zeikier> how much of this will you stream vs off-stream playing?
[4:48:02] <@Jekado> the UI is pretty bad
[4:48:02] <%Chichen> you get used to it.
[4:48:03] <TheYellowcouch> yeah we all agree
[4:48:04] <Toilet_Snake> that's fair
[4:48:06] <OneThousandTomatoes> it cam be weird on controller
[4:48:07] <@Jekado> thats it
[4:48:10] <Mortal_Wombat_I> Hope we can see Paige and Pat run Sastasha
[4:48:10] <%BoxNavy> i had lots of problems with the map too. you learn
[4:48:13] <+Tarage> Remember the original game that had NO MAP AT ALL?
[4:48:14] <Mortal_Wombat_I> That would be LEGENDARY
[4:48:16] <%Jackgar> Honestly the area you started in is the part with the hardest map to navigate in the game. It just gets easier
[4:48:23] <luftraumm1> ui has a LOT of information
[4:48:23] <afronooch> the controller controls trip everyone up at first to be fair
[4:48:25] <vVAstrAVv> you get used to the map and its fine after that
[4:48:29] <%Dakuu75> @OneThousandTomatoes we didn't even get to the part about the cross-hot-bar stuff lol
[4:48:30] <%abakkus> the music *keeps getting better* if you'll believe it
[4:48:31] <Estwilde> You'll get more used to it
[4:48:31] <+Hilleltaco> it eases you into it
[4:48:32] <Zeikier> gridania's theme is a favorite
[4:48:33] <@thenefftw> the map is just something you learn to deal with
[4:48:37] <TheYellowcouch> The game does a good job of easing you in
[4:48:48] <+Tarage> Grandpa baby want attention
[4:49:06] <tusk102> it gets harder but it ramps up at a slope instead of just jumping up randomly
[4:49:06] <$Sphincter_Spelunker> but dark souls
[4:49:09] <@SoFarFetched> I feel like its a comfort game more like
[4:49:11] <+projectmanatees> comfort game
[4:49:15] <TheYellowcouch> I'd say don't feel obligated to play this on stream always
[4:49:15] <%Elky3> it can be both
[4:49:16] <+Tarage> Baba is You is a comfort game
[4:49:16] <%Chichen> @PeachSaliva Stream story, enjoy other stuff off stream?
[4:49:16] <xxshadowxx416> now only 40 more hours
[4:49:17] <@StridentSong> Definitely a comfort game
[4:49:17] <@SoFarFetched> honestly better to experience the story yourself.
[4:49:19] <%Jackgar> Have you seen the intro movie for A Realm Reborn, perchance?
[4:49:20] <%SuckerPunchSyd> Comfort game is good
[4:49:21] <@JustinianKnight> maybe not stream ALL on stream but just when you want to
[4:49:23] <%hairtoday> stream every now and then to show progress
[4:49:25] <Mortal_Wombat_I> comfort game with occasional streams for funsies?
[4:49:28] <Aeonknight_87> intro movie~
[4:49:28] <TheYellowcouch> Take your time and stream if you want to
[4:49:28] <Zeikier> maybe you can stream the end of each patch? like the finale of each expansion?
[4:49:30] <%abakkus> It's a very good comfort game, except for the story beats that rip tears out of you, but comforting all the same
[4:49:31] <%Agami23> could always just pop it up on stream as a "heres an update on progress" rather than streamign it all the time
[4:49:32] <+Ynkubus_> comfort with possible streams is the best
[4:49:33] <+Tarage> Now if only we could get Woolie to play
[4:49:34] <@SoFarFetched> she was told not to
[4:49:35] <%cobalt_phoenix_> if you only do this on stream it would take a veeeery long time, best to do on your own probably
[4:49:37] <@SoFarFetched> I think geefThink
[4:49:38] <%SuckerPunchSyd> Yeah 100% agree with fetched
[4:49:39] <%BoxNavy> monkaS elmo
[4:49:40] <%Nobrev> probably more of a comfort game until you get more acquainted with it
[4:49:47] <+logoth_> psaHoldon
[4:49:50] <@JustinianKnight> the one with Bahamut
[4:49:50] <Aleate> psaElmo
[4:49:52] <Monkeyweed21> stream it when you want but otherwise use it as a comfort game
[4:49:53] <%Jackgar> Did it have a big dragon in it that blew stuff up?
[4:49:56] <@SoFarFetched> when you tried watching the ARR opening cinematic,pat was like "SKIP IT"
[4:49:56] <%cobalt_phoenix_> @Tarage wdym, we already got him to make a character Kappa
[4:50:01] <tusk102> thats the one
[4:50:01] <%Chichen> Ye

[4:52:54] <%Chichen> you will learn
[4:52:55] <Dapper_Cactuar> YEAAAHHH TANK PROGRAM
[4:52:55] <@thenefftw> yeah!
[4:52:56] <@Jekado> its an ultros meme
[4:53:00] <%SuckerPunchSyd> TANK PROGRAM IS GREAT
[4:53:02] <%stoatacious> YEEEEE
[4:53:03] <@thenefftw> Tank Program!
[4:53:11] <%Fooguwu> @PeachSaliva my sub message was just poking you to go do physical therapy if you haven't yet, for your back! it's helped with mine so much, they usually have special tools and ways to treat you that you can't do at home
[4:53:23] <%DianaTheAscian> Tank Paige seems fitting
[4:53:30] <T_Sasquatch> Paige tanking would be hilarious
[4:53:34] <+Medrex> have you considered healer? we have fun, we swear
[4:53:34] <CyborgAV> WAR is pretty rad
[4:53:37] <buddhistmetal> FFXIV was my first MMO, within 8 months I was working on my omnicrafter. There's so much to do, hope you enjoy yourself ^_^
[4:53:37] <+Mekhet09> warriors do little damage and get yelled at the most...
[4:53:42] <%BlackMage66652> ULDAH HAS HOOKERS AND IS THUS BEST
[4:53:42] <%Jackgar> WAR is BIG and STRONG
[4:53:48] <+Tarage> RACE WAR
[4:53:54] <%polothegreatest> healer LUL
[4:53:59] <%Jackgar> @Mekhet09 Yeah but Fell Cleave, tho
[4:54:16] <%blue8moon> you get a pretty dress tho
[4:54:18] <CyborgAV> It's super cute
[4:54:18] <buddhistmetal> weddings in 14 are lit
[4:54:18] <%DianaTheAscian> You get a mount out of it
[4:54:24] <+Tarage> You're engaged but are you MMO Engaged? That's the big one.
[4:54:33] <%DianaTheAscian> and the ceremony is super cute
[4:54:33] <%JenovasPuppet> You don't NEED to level up a crafter, but you'll WANT to level up a crafter if you're going to get married
[4:54:57] <+Mekhet09> @jackgar it's fun but the rest of the rotation lol.
[4:55:16] <@StridentSong> I would forego accepting friend requests right now if Pat doesn't approve them
[4:55:20] <%stoatacious> war smooth brain gang!
[4:55:21] <TheYellowcouch> Get Pat to vet people by his friend list and you should be good to start
[4:55:23] <%Jackgar> Would you want a variant on your vtuber model that looks like your viera?
[4:55:25] <%blue8moon> the thing about friend requests is that even if you remove someone from your friend list, you aren't removed from theirs, which causes problems
[4:55:26] <%JenovasPuppet> Get your legs under you before taking non-Pat approved friend requests, would be my advice.
[4:55:44] <@SoFarFetched> @StridentSong ESPECIALLY from someone named "Sir SoFarFetched" I heard they tried to give pineapple juice
[4:55:46] <$Sphincter_Spelunker> friend lists generally let you know when they're online. just don't accept someone you don't know
[4:55:47] <NireFuster> Ooooh!
[4:55:52] <Valdorick> My sister also had trouble with the maps at first.
[4:55:54] <@Jekado> Uldah and Limsa is kinda hard to navigate at first
[4:55:57] <%Jackgar> The bun speaks to your soul, clearly!
[4:56:03] <raineedaydreams> that'd be so cute
[4:56:04] <%Fooguwu> @PeachSaliva my sub message was just poking you to go do physical therapy if you haven't yet, for your back! it's helped with mine so much, they usually have special tools and ways to treat you that you can't do at home
[4:56:06] <+Tarage> IDK man that FarFetched guy seems pretty okay.
[4:56:11] <Monkeyweed21> the other two zones are open plains and desert
[4:56:12] <RushUnplugged> the map isn't the best but if you get used to checking mainly the minimap, and only the bigger one for details, it gets easier
[4:56:26] <NireFuster> Good choice! Fox definitely fits you
[4:56:26] <%BlackMage66652> Does Paige know you can wear Fox ears in FF14?
[4:56:28] <%abakkus> also foxes are ginger colored :v
