[1:00:25] <lethallylactic> LUL
[1:00:26] <$ZeOrbling> hey chat how long has she been on?
[1:00:29] <PeteyMcPickle> surprisingly good Scottish accent
[1:00:29] <coke_monster> Morrah with their warmed floors.
[1:00:31] <Vitoria90> there's been plenty of Lucatiel cosplays
[1:00:31] <+Fuggins4U> CHAINJ YER FAYTTT
[1:00:33] <damienlunas> If ye had a chance to change yer face, would yeh
[1:00:33] <+SWFanatic> @ClaudeMcGarren its a mask
[1:00:35] <+corrosivePaladin> Because noone is cool enough to make her armor
[1:00:36] <GarbageQueenEllie> She's too cool
[1:00:36] <%legendfather_of_giants> she's not very interesting
[1:00:37] <transporterthesequel> Lucatiel is the best thing about DS2
[1:00:37] <+Elky3> because its not Lewd Kappa
[1:00:38] <Mister_McDerp> the man mask probably
[1:00:38] <%rumtumtugnutz> recitent cock flavoring
[1:00:39] <+ClaudeMcGarren> aaaaaah
[1:00:40] <Heartless_01> she is dumb
[1:00:41] <Hanyusha> I think people only do artorias and default knights

[1:00:45] <$BallerSwagBro9k> Oh thye do.....
[1:00:45] <AxelCezar> not enough sexy bits showing
[1:00:45] <+CJett92> @ZeOrbling Started playing the game about 30 minutes ago
[1:00:45] <@SSaryn> Cause Dark Souls cosplay is basically delegated to Solaire and nothing else
[1:00:46] <dabeaminator> Because DS2 isn't that popular.
[1:00:48] <koolaid_kevster> you cosplay her paige
[1:00:50] <$lotharrio> People are low on DS2, but her armor set still got into DS3, because she's cool as hell
[1:00:51] <$ZeOrbling> thanks!
[1:00:55] <GarbageQueenEllie> Get yoself a lass that can do both
[1:00:56] <Mister_McDerp> shes super undead
[1:00:57] <Fien111> Have you heard of the high elves?
[1:00:59] <+ClaudeMcGarren> @SWFanatic did not like ds2 so didnt play much of it at all gotcha ty
[1:01:00] <Fryclan> because people hate everything
[1:01:00] <coke_monster> ...?
[1:01:03] <SpaceGuntank> DS3 and 1 overshadowed DS2 so its not well known/popular
[1:01:04] <TheBlankAce> This game is also like 6 years old at this point
[1:01:06] <+Tearonex> the best chracter in this entire game
[1:01:12] <+Evitron1> have you heard of the high elves?
[1:01:12] <Mister_McDerp> she has alzheimers
[1:01:15] <spongeofmystery> Have you heard of the high elves?
[1:01:23] <GarbageQueenEllie> Dude she literally said change yer fate
[1:01:25] <MetaFurrical> Face Reveal PogChamp
[1:01:30] <%rumtumtugnutz> isn't base DS2 a large suck?
[1:01:40] <coke_monster> No goatee.

[1:17:11] <dabeaminator> Pat will never let her use the Grand Lance because he has preconceived notions of it being bad. He's so enamored with that sword. He made Woolie use it too.

[1:39:25] <weissguard> Yes
[1:39:32] <brambobelurkin> Bloodborne would only be enjoyable if you get off on the murder. Then it would be great to live in Yharnam.
[1:39:32] <%QueequegTheater> Majula is actually fucking SAFE THOUGH
[1:39:35] <%skm742> 99 is def the best bet.

[1:41:37] <ScreamLord> Charlotte's gonna be pissed
[1:41:41] <Jetsfantasy> I still need to get through this game. The 'weird' feeling of the game always threw me off compared to DS1
[1:41:45] <$lotharrio> Can't wait for Paige to "accidentally" cut the Maiden's head off.
[1:41:45] <%QueequegTheater> @legendfather_of_giants doesn't stop invasions tho

[1:41:51] <floralkami> @agami23 how the actual fuck

[1:42:07] <KingGoblodyte> F
[1:42:08] <EuropanLamprey> Which is now
[1:42:08] <dabeaminator> Pat thinks the only way to play this game is the way he played it. Hence why both Paige and Woolie have gotten stuck on the greatsword.
[1:42:12] <%MeMillionthDollar> Even numbers sipsipGasm
[1:42:18] <Novapulsus> Thank you chat
[1:42:26] <tigerfang86> HUGE damage
[1:42:26] <+CJett92> IM A DAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAD
[1:42:28] <Shishi1205> the greatsword is great
[1:42:30] <EuropanLamprey> 28 strength to one hand Greatsword and solve the stick problem
[1:42:33] <a_c_chirns> get CHUFFED
[1:42:34] <%QueequegTheater> @PeachSaliva she'd be doing more with the grand lance. It's like it was tailor made for her play style
[1:42:40] <fruit_pie_the_magician> This song is the musical equivalent of trying to stay awake, but you're so tired your dreams are actively overtaking you while you're still conscious
[1:42:43] <CrematedCube> greatsword is greatest sword
[1:42:45] <OToole42> yeah, rolling 1handed r1's with the greatsword are handy
[1:42:47] <%QueequegTheater> I can never be silenced
[1:42:48] <ogHALLOWEEN> BARS
[1:42:49] <waterstealer> wcduff

[1:42:56] <+Darren716> nvm
[1:42:59] <MyNameIsRasus> someone invade her game and give her a second greatsword
[1:43:02] <%QueequegTheater> It's literally "Facefuck: The Weapon"
[1:43:02] <Coystick> Lance the world
[1:43:02] <Sapphire_Breeze> it's more fun to see her miss so fuck the lance
[1:43:04] <@Calek> she said she likes to smash not poke though
[1:43:04] <theshadowproducer> is it iresponsible to give pat money
[1:43:05] <dabeaminator> Yes
[1:43:06] <+patriotrenegade> Yes

[1:43:11] <JDebss> I love the grand lance but it's not for Paige
[1:43:13] <lilo52> fuck lance
[1:43:16] <weissguard> That's a lie. LUL
[1:43:17] <Shishi1205> big sword for big dick energy
[1:43:20] <Coystick> Justice for Grandlance
[1:43:21] <+SaltySkeleton12> @PeachSaliva consider popping a human effigy at some point, get some of that health back?
[1:43:21] <Sunstalker> It is more of a STAMPEDE than a POKE with the grand lance.
[1:43:22] <+patriotrenegade> Better damage, better stagger, better poise damage
[1:43:26] <%QueequegTheater> :(
[1:43:27] <%trustycoyote> Does the lance smash? No.
[1:43:30] <fruit_pie_the_magician> I think she should use the Malformed Skull
[1:43:32] <ScreamLord> I actually had a lot of fun with the Grand Lance back in the day
[1:43:33] <tigerfang86> GOT EM
[1:43:33] <%RafflesiaA> Honestly none of this weapon arguing matters because fume is inevitable
[1:43:38] <+patriotrenegade> She already tried using it and liked it
[1:43:41] <%QueequegTheater> there it is
[1:43:43] <MyNameIsRasus> queequeg might like that tho
[1:43:43] <Lord_of_all_Edges> If you pester them enough, you will get your way.
[1:43:45] <%QueequegTheater> it's on the right
[1:43:45] <TonyPullMyDTRedgrave> @QueequegTheater except for how she literally just said she wants a smashy weapon not a stabby weapon so it would actually be the antithesis of her play style <_<
[1:43:48] <dabeaminator> You made her try it un-upgraded on an enemy so she'd think it was bad. You also refused to show her the heavy lunge.
[1:43:50] <+Grayhammatter> just do it though
[1:43:50] <hollaback_gnome> @dabeaminator In Pats defense Woolie chose the greatsword on his own after seeing it and the miracles nerf, and Paige ran giant build in DS1
[1:43:54] <EuropanLamprey> She doesn't have the stats for it, but the strong attack knocks everything down
[1:43:56] <fruit_pie_the_magician> MALFORMED SKULL

[1:45:21] <dabeaminator> It's a Strength weapon, her stats are exactly made for it, what are you talking about
[1:45:22] <Ipsenscastle> We need a number just for Queequeg. 4 I guess
[1:45:24] <+jasole37> grand Lance is my favorite weapon in all of dark souls, the greatsword is second favorite

[2:28:56] <Nina96> i usually roll back for that move
[2:28:56] <Finakala> Twice, PT

[2:29:04] <%Pandora_Prime> PAIGE CURSED
[2:29:04] <%Keyd00d> twice
[2:29:04] <lilo52> epic hitboxes
[2:29:04] <@Calek> you fought him twice
[2:29:06] <@Calek> at least twice
[2:29:09] <+Grayhammatter> he didn't pursue at all
[2:29:10] <+KennyK> he pursued you multiple times in D2
[2:29:10] <KingGoblodyte> TWICE PAT
[2:29:14] <+KennyK> 4 times
[2:29:20] <a_c_chirns> but WHY does he fight?
[2:29:20] <Shishi1205> 4 times by now
[2:29:24] <dabeaminator> You also fought him after Smelter Demon
[2:29:26] <T_Sasquatch> He's here in the original
[2:29:26] <$wolfofsound> Pat wrong about dark souls? Kappa
[2:29:27] <$lotharrio> The item that was destroyed looks like it was a "Rouge Water." Healing item that also recovers spell uses.
[2:29:29] <corepercentlives> Don't fret Lady Blind Sword you will conquer your enemies PeoplesChamp
[2:29:30] <bevyrage> boss fight and three optional zones, one of which requires fighting another boss first
[2:29:34] <Darmarock> He is also Armored Core reference
[2:29:37] <%trustycoyote> I never knew that, Pat! Only played the base game. THat's neat!
[2:29:37] <Mendin> I like that most of his reappearances are here, which you access after killing him the first time. It's the biggest "NAH MAN RUN IT BACK YOU DIDN'T WIN, ONE MORE, ONE MORE"
[2:29:39] <$Alpha8087> I like the face on the wall watchinng the fight
[2:29:39] <+storebrandcandy> the pursuer is so graceful hes like a ballerina of death
[2:29:42] <Scrub_Seeker> 4 times in vanilla DS2 actually, boss fight, in the bastille, after smelter demon, and in NG+ with 2 pursuer fight
[2:29:42] <Shishi1205> if you notice he has big curse energy
[2:29:50] <%RafflesiaA> He keeps fighting to find that answer @a_c_chirns
[2:29:53] <Habblewater> Oh i was thinking of a DS1 Curse
[2:29:54] <MoulesFritz> why not use r2 for big sing
[2:29:55] <zenith0111> But the 1st encounter is super skipable so 1 to 2.
[2:29:57] <+PaladinDupre> @PeachSaliva use your rolling attack more, its really, really good.
[2:30:00] <+SpamKingRathalos> Ruh roh
[2:30:01] <Jetsfantasy> Here's an odd fact. "The Pursuer was inspired by DMC4's Credo Angelo Credo. This was verified by game maker Hiroshima Takatsu. Credo refers to Angelo Credo from Devil May Cry 4 (single shield, single sword, both use flying/gliding attacks)"

[2:37:43] <+AXL808> Hacked items can be detected and will sometimes result in the DS account being suspended from online. With so many items as such a high level those items could be hacked.

[2:38:06] <studleydoorite> jermaOneguy be afwaaaaid
[2:38:06] <Zooperton> TRUE
[2:38:07] <ralwatt> You literally cannot get banned for having items that exist anywhere in the game.
[2:38:08] <+0range_> fatherdad is so wrong
[2:38:09] <Jetsfantasy> If it's an item that can be obtained legitimately in-game, it's safe. Consumable drops are fine, but be wary of equipment drops.

[2:38:13] <hagly> It's fiiiiiiinnneeee
