[0:04:55] <Melchior_the_Wise> He's so smooth
[0:04:58] <lotharrio> Is it because of his gaunt, skeletal appearance?
[0:04:59] <blastazoid00> I've never played the DLC, im going to enjoy this
[0:05:00] <%dankjerri> youd fuck that new dick
[0:05:01] <%AncelDeLambert> Paige, how have you, the Skeleton Queen, fallen for a man with no skeleton?
[0:05:02] <+realm_forge> Honestly it’s the best Trek show to come out since DS9
[0:05:03] <+the_mental_punk> @goblinpuppy yea
[0:05:12] <+Dante_Magnum> Garak is master tier character
[0:05:12] <%JenovasPuppet> Garak the Genocider
[0:05:25] <%patriotrenegade> sure
[0:05:27] <metalsiren31> The Quark and Garak root beer scene is like the best thing in Star Trek
[0:05:29] <%AncelDeLambert> for why?
[0:05:30] <%patriotrenegade> go for it
[0:05:32] <%Chichen> what
[0:05:33] <%dankjerri> garak 'swing first on the genocide' dukat

[0:05:34] <GarbageQueenEllie> Hmmm yea ok
[0:05:37] <Dr_Mooose> hm hm

[0:05:40] <%AncelDeLambert> Paige you had it last night, you were just dodging too early
[0:05:41] <%Treuan> Worth a shot
[0:05:41] <+FoolsArcade> thats not gonna speed up your swings
[0:05:42] <blastazoid00> but big number
[0:05:42] <inkwell1932> go for it!
[0:05:42] <%Lion_kun> Paige you are not good enough to parry
[0:05:44] <%Chichen> oh ok
[0:05:44] <+Dante_Magnum> Elim Garak: Former Cardassian Opressor
[0:05:46] <DrkJP520> Why not nolth?
[0:05:47] <%Lion_kun> or block
[0:05:50] <DraxTD> hay @PeachSaliva , you remember the episode where you get to see the DS9 cast as all humans without thier fancy makeup rigs?
[0:05:50] <+the_mental_punk> Use different shield ?
[0:05:50] <%Lion_kun> JSUT DO BIG DAMAGE
[0:05:52] <GarbageQueenEllie> I mean the shields there, might as well use it

[0:05:59] <%patriotrenegade> luckily you cant parry the wolf
[0:06:01] <%doomunderthestairs> if thats the case si there a better shield you can use for defense
[0:06:04] <goblinpuppy> @the_mental_punk thank you!
[0:06:05] <fruit_pie_the_magician> But you're using a giant hammer and the grass shield has ass stability
[0:06:05] <+FingaLights> She will blockj zero times

[0:26:54] <%KeiganOfAstora> Frost and Bleed proc are basically easy mode as it takes off extra damage
[0:26:56] <%GabeSweetMan> Those bird fuckers kick many an ass.
[0:26:59] <%AncelDeLambert> if she wants to finish this dlc first she has to pathfind her way through it

[0:28:56] <fruit_pie_the_magician> @judicator_revan  The frostbite effect more than makes up for any other minor gain in strength
[0:28:57] <%KeiganOfAstora> Uppa
[0:28:59] <BigFingerRo> So lesson learned: DS3 favors VIG and STR HEAVILY
[0:29:02] <%KeiganOfAstora> Pretty veil
[0:29:09] <The_UnfathoMarble> Man Ravenclaw as seen better days sheesh
[0:29:09] <%Fooguwu> Drop down in that ladder area for cool pants

[0:29:20] <Eightesu> Missing lots  of stuff
[0:29:22] <carrion_king_> oh wait no she did it!
[0:29:26] <%KeiganOfAstora> DS3 favors whatever you want. In a NG run everything is "strong enough"
[0:29:26] <%Velociraptor_Cleftes> BIG AND STRONG
[0:29:28] <Dr_Mooose> she's too good
[0:29:29] <NiftyNox> Tbh dark 3 almost doesnt let you make a "tank" build
[0:29:30] <%GabeSweetMan> I can't believe how hard she's beasting this.
[0:29:33] <%JenovasPuppet> The unga cannot be outbunga'd

[0:30:03] <%Fooguwu> you get cool pants for jumping down in the ladder room
[0:30:04] <blastazoid00> It does
[0:30:10] <TurtlesAndTentacles> better than blight town lol
[0:30:13] <judicator_revan> and plus if you put a dark gem on the fume ultra or lothric knight sword it does overtly more damage
[0:30:14] <%patriotrenegade> Its quaint!
[0:30:20] <%BlowFireThroatTotem> How spooky is this game compared to Bloodborne for you, Paige?

[0:31:37] <%GabeSweetMan> This is perhaps the least disgusting of the Blighttown's. It's more "corruption" than poo, but it's still got plenty of poo too.

[0:33:50] <+Ne1son> Paige is a real tough bloke
[0:33:52] <fruit_pie_the_magician> This game is based off bloodborne, so R1 spam is the hidden easy mode. It stunlocks anything with any weapon
[0:33:59] <%Fooguwu> @PatStaresAt the assless chaps that gael wears

[0:36:11] <%impulse255dj> arrySup
[0:36:11] <%KeiganOfAstora> Roll attack is soooo good
[0:36:15] <%Velociraptor_Cleftes> BIG AND STRONG
[0:36:16] <%AncelDeLambert> if Paige played Team Fortress 2 she'd be a W+MS1 Pyro

[0:36:57] <+DrMcDreamy108> It was a retirement gift.
[0:37:00] <%patriotrenegade> @PeachSaliva The Sable Church is the same organization Yuria is part of
[0:37:05] <+TheFabledAble> that sword fucks
[0:37:07] <BigYanno> it's a blade, and it's onyx
[0:37:08] <sirrice77> onyx blade is decent
[0:37:09] <%AncelDeLambert> you should probably clear out your inventory next bonfire
[0:37:11] <%KeiganOfAstora> @PeachSaliva Check the description of your hammer please
[0:37:12] <Coystick> Onyx Blade got good after they buff Greatswords, longest reach in class
[0:37:13] <%JobbedBone> 4 stat item, damn
[0:37:16] <StrapStreams> That's kinda romantic in a way
[0:37:18] <+Thesaltt> Black fire's pretty cool
[0:37:19] <%AncelDeLambert> which hammer?
[0:37:22] <%AncelDeLambert> LUL

[0:38:52] <Coystick> Start a fucking f i r e for her
[0:38:52] <benjiFG> "you talked to me, now I feel like leaving"
[0:38:54] <%doomunderthestairs> don't kill this woman
[0:38:57] <laserbeaming> the last boss for this is fucking hard
[0:38:59] <$hattrick61> SMASH VVOMAN

[0:39:04] <+ft3me> Tis good :)
[0:39:10] <@PatStaresAt> @PeachSaliva Gael was the weird kneeling red knight guy that warped you here, he's cool. She is in fact the painter
[0:39:11] <$hrbeck_> kill her like the fire keeper
[0:39:12] <%KeiganOfAstora> Totally get reach the boss tonight. This takes 30-90 minutes depending on how much you die
[0:39:15] <%patriotrenegade> @PeachSaliva The painter is FATHER Ariendel, whos under the church. She's a different painter
[0:39:16] <+ThomasOfTroy> You know, her position on that table really reminds me of Bloodborne more some reason...
[0:39:16] <%dankjerri> why did you not kill woman
[0:39:22] <%Lion_kun> open door
[0:39:31] <%SveriSageAdvice> if Paige beats the boss for this DLC tonight, she has the biggest dick energy out of any Dark Souls fan
[0:39:39] <@PatStaresAt> peepee poopoo
[0:39:40] <%Lion_kun> go back and kill crow knights, coward
[0:39:41] <%patriotrenegade> close enough

[0:39:58] <BigYanno> go murder a crow or 3
[0:39:59] <%AncelDeLambert> I have never once beaten the final boss of the DLC, I reached max give up this iteration
[0:40:01] <markdreizehn> I sure hope Paige doesn't get hit by any Jem Hadar anti coagulation phasers in this stream
[0:40:03] <+RD_NX> psaGib
[0:40:04] <%its_just_whatever_dude> sipsipElmo sipsipElmo
[0:40:06] <$AzureGale> mmmm, souls

[0:40:14] <%AncelDeLambert> I just DON'T care about the dlc, it never motivated me to finish
[0:40:22] <shotgang86> sipsipElmo
[0:40:24] <Treasure_Vault> There are a bunch of Jem Hadar in the next area, might be trouble.
[0:40:25] <StrapStreams> Paige does Elmo ever try to steal Gief's food or the other way around?
[0:40:27] <$Sphincter_Spelunker> you really don't need more levels, you blitzed through the DLC as is @PeachSaliva
[0:40:32] <Ethel9727> :O Pat calling you Peaches is so cute. My dog is named Peaches :3
[0:40:38] <%doomunderthestairs> god the dancer set is so fucking cool
[0:40:46] <@PatStaresAt> You COULD always have more levels though sphincter
[0:40:47] <%SveriSageAdvice> @AncelDeLambert i used Havel's Shield and i beat the very final boss of the DLCs on first try, that shield is broken af lol
[0:40:48] <+ThomasOfTroy> This dlc has the best boss lol, you missed out
[0:40:51] <$AzureGale> Making progress, Pat is no longer freaking Paige out :p
[0:40:52] <BigYanno> i was doing a kind of collectathon run of Cinders and entered ng+ at the low low level of 245
[0:40:52] <laserbeaming> @anceldelambert I beat that boss ONLY because of the cool weapon
[0:41:02] <laserbeaming> that weapon is too cool
[0:41:02] <%ReenMan350> ReenMan350 subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 43 months! peepeepoopoo

[0:41:14] <+RD_NX> I love this firelink theme
[0:41:15] <%KeiganOfAstora> I'm thinking Artorias set with Dancer head piece would look SUPREME @PeachSaliva @PatStaresAt
[0:41:16] <$hattrick61> SHIDFART
[0:41:18] <%patriotrenegade> pass
[0:41:21] <$Sphincter_Spelunker> @PatStaresAt "So I've been grinding offscreen"
[0:41:22] <%SveriSageAdvice> @AncelDeLambert every other attempt to do the DLC on any other build was thwarted and i still have not beaten them again because i get stomped by Friede
[0:41:24] <%doomunderthestairs> go back to crow pass
[0:41:27] <%AncelDeLambert> little did I know, of course, that said boss is just Maria all over again. Now that I've played Bloodborne, FUCK MARIA!
[0:41:27] <CandyCoatedConfection> Paige has really captured the spirit of a good dark souls player lately
[0:41:46] <%Monkeyweed21> you can go up the path or look in the church for cool stuff
[0:41:48] <+RD_NX> framedrops anyone else?
[0:41:53] <%KeiganOfAstora> yea
[0:41:55] <+ThomasOfTroy> A few
[0:41:55] <+babushkakoi> Maria is fun in Bloodborne
[0:41:56] <%dankjerri> nAh
[0:41:59] <+babushkakoi> Not so good here
[0:41:59] <%KeiganOfAstora> Just for a second there
[0:42:14] <+the_mental_punk> Leaves are just tree feathers
[0:42:27] <NiftyNox> trees are just ground birds
[0:42:32] <$AzureGale> nyannMegalul
[0:42:34] <danknugglit> Big and cool and strong
[0:42:41] <%patriotrenegade> Shes gonna get lost in here for sure, Pat sure did.
[0:42:41] <BigYanno> my second favorite boss will come soon limesDance
[0:42:56] <%Puhff> shhhh
[0:43:00] <Treasure_Vault> I can sympathize with Peach, as I also pick the biggest hammer I can find in every souls game.
[0:43:03] <shotgang86> Man I never considered using Vordt's Hammer, maybe when I play this game again I'll use it.
[0:43:04] <%dankjerri> so many
[0:43:08] <%Velociraptor_Cleftes> @NiftyNox TheIlluminati
[0:43:30] <+DrMcDreamy108> This is quite the exciting area.
[0:43:36] <$Sphincter_Spelunker> @shotgang86 it's the frostbite. I normally go for the giant curved sword or a club
[0:43:40] <BigYanno> I've tried using ultra heavy weapons but I can never get into the swing of them, no pun intended
[0:43:47] <%graemecrackers2> Flame go roar
[0:43:59] <%inkwell1932> inkwell1932 subscribed at Tier 1. 
[0:44:09] <%freelancebabymaker> these arent the olympics motherfuckers
[0:44:23] <%Velociraptor_Cleftes> always intend your puns, don't be a coward
[0:44:23] <@PatStaresAt> Man she's really fucking got the swing of it huh
[0:44:24] <%inkwell1932> YOOOO
[0:44:33] <el_r0berto> SWING of it LUL
[0:44:36] <%M3djedx> ah yes, great year
[0:44:41] <rudiciuscaesar> Yeah, Mustard Queen is liveeeee
[0:44:41] <shotgang86> @Sphincter_Spelunker yeah Frostbite seems like an useless stat debuff to have in this game but look at this damage
[0:44:44] <BigYanno> personally I've recently had fun doing a parry run, target shield and baller swag sword
[0:44:45] <$Sphincter_Spelunker> @BigYanno the rolling attack is the livesaver, maybe try one with a rolling attack that you're comfortable with?
[0:44:45] <danknugglit> Boo
[0:44:50] <+Archphronimos> Paige is BIG AND HUGE
[0:44:52] <%dankjerri> fucking just hit me in my skull with that hammer
[0:44:59] <%brokendarktower> based on the dialogue from the bird dude i wouldve thought the painted world feared fire, but no we have these flamethrowing guys everywhere
[0:45:01] <%JenovasPuppet> It don't mean a thing, if you ain't got that swing
[0:45:06] <Treasure_Vault> Back massage with that hammer please
[0:45:09] <%patriotrenegade> Go into the gorge up ahead for a sick weapon @PeachSaliva
[0:45:11] <rudiciuscaesar> Man, this is a weird Skyrim mod...
[0:45:14] <%AncelDeLambert> I wish I could remember where you get the Follower Torch in vanilla
[0:45:15] <@PatStaresAt> That roll attack is SO GOOD
[0:45:16] <%freelancebabymaker> @brokendarktower they arent natives
[0:45:20] <%AncelDeLambert> oh yeah, big hammer in ditch

[0:45:46] <%Fooguwu> Remember how a bell woke you up at the start of the game? That big ass bell back there is the one Friede knocked down so no one in here like you wouldw ake
[0:45:46] <@PatStaresAt> Have you guys noticed her reflexes have dramatically improved?

[0:47:52] <$Sphincter_Spelunker> the nightshades were holding her back
[0:48:02] <Treasure_Vault> I like sneaky muted Pat. He's like a shark full of tips.
[0:48:02] <%JobbedBone> the real glasses were inside her all along BibleThump
[0:48:03] <%doomunderthestairs> yeah something like that
[0:48:03] <rudiciuscaesar> Did Paige beat any bosses yet?
[0:48:09] <$Chatterbox1991> litterally I was thinking the word businessman and Paige said buisnessman
[0:48:09] <%freelancebabymaker> half an hour until WALL
[0:48:12] <%JenovasPuppet> @Idziman lol fair point. Every stream she had to relearn the game from scratch.
[0:48:12] <%doomunderthestairs> yeah gravetender at the start
[0:48:20] <$Chatterbox1991> I HAVE MAGIC POWERS
[0:48:22] <shotgang86> Did she went to the bottom of the area of the Bridge?
[0:48:23] <AthenaAegis> She'll fly through it, until Pat jinxes it Kappa
[0:48:29] <BigYanno> yeah but the boss might take a try or 50
[0:48:31] <Coystick> If only Gravetender wasn't such a shit fight, this'd be my fav dlc otherwise.
[0:48:31] <el_r0berto> whirlFlex
[0:48:32] <rudiciuscaesar> gravetender....oh the dude with the wolf?
[0:48:33] <%Velociraptor_Cleftes> @rudiciuscaesar Paige started the stream beating the gravetender on first try
[0:48:33] <shotgang86> And fought the champion and Not Sif?
[0:48:35] <Dunmarkh> @rudiciuscaesar she killed swordshieldwolflion man
[0:48:43] <+ghostfaceninja_> KomodoHype
[0:48:43] <%JobbedBone> cool party trick, nerd LUL
[0:48:45] <%dankjerri> nerd
[0:48:48] <%doomunderthestairs> yea wolf boy
[0:48:49] <%KeiganOfAstora> @shotgang86 yup
[0:48:51] <@PatStaresAt> She killed the tower boss in a single try apparently, I wans't even here
[0:49:04] <%KeiganOfAstora> @PatStaresAt LUL Yea first try
[0:49:07] <rudiciuscaesar> how do you even get to the wolf swordsmen combo, I can't even remember!
[0:49:10] <%IamGrapes> when did Paige get gud?
[0:49:13] <%king_wragles> Ya, I think she can 1 hand this DLC
[0:49:17] <danknugglit> Is elmo secretly playing today?
[0:49:21] <Tahzani> France, they are from france
[0:49:24] <%doomunderthestairs> you buy or transpose for his set I don't recall
[0:49:28] <BigYanno> well at least this doesn't have the BULLSHIT frostfire colossus that is in cinders
[0:49:32] <%Velociraptor_Cleftes> for real, beaten a boss and got past a couple ninjas and there have been no deaths all stream...this is crazy
[0:49:33] <shotgang86> Holy fuck thats amazing
[0:49:39] <@PatStaresAt> If she can get to Soul level 104 then she can fully switch over to Friedes scythe which is a direct DPS upgrade to hammer
[0:49:43] <%JobbedBone> @Tahzani IS THAT A FUCKING CONHEADS REFERENCE
[0:49:44] <%dankjerri> facetank
[0:49:46] <rudiciuscaesar> @IamGrapes Paige got good in 2017 playing Bloodborne, she handicaps herself like Goku and Piccolo, except she doesn't wear weighted clothing.
[0:49:58] <jetpack_rorschasch> I turned up 20 minutes late and she's gone through like half the dlc. So who the fuck injected her with super serum?
[0:49:59] <%king_wragles> I thought scythe was a balanced weapon?
[0:50:03] <%JobbedBone> why does seeing that make me feel *old*
[0:50:04] <%KeiganOfAstora> That Scythe is so damn good
[0:50:04] <Tahzani> @JobbedBone Yes
[0:50:07] <danknugglit> But less unga
[0:50:08] <%inkwell1932> i don't know shit about dark souls lol i'm just along for the ride
[0:50:09] <%king_wragles> Wait, I'm thinking of a different scythe
[0:50:16] <%doomunderthestairs> ring it

[0:51:31] <benjiFG> casting the spell, "hit the ground really fucking hard"

[0:52:07] <%doomunderthestairs> wow I forgot about the range on that windup swing
[0:52:12] <plzza_kun> "That's awesome!!!" she said while flying in midair

[0:53:58] <%JobbedBone> the different combo may have helped
[0:54:00] <Marakami_Sadaneo> I like how Paige is streaming more regularly now
[0:54:03] <%Velociraptor_Cleftes> back in the cave that the viking was guarding
[0:54:03] <TheOpinionater> she... sees?
[0:54:04] <%JenovasPuppet> Oh well, Pat says she's going scythe, so the other weapon doesn't matter.
[0:54:09] <+callmeflippy> tunr aroud
[0:54:11] <BigYanno> "oh I see" *proceeds to not go there*
[0:54:15] <rudiciuscaesar> woah that sipsipblind emoji is amazing...
[0:54:17] <DanThePumpkinman> you know what i hate? maces that call themselves hammers. that not a hammer, its a honkin big mace
[0:54:23] <%dankjerri> HypeSquawk
[0:54:25] <%Monkeyweed21> the cave was behind big man
[0:54:42] <%Draylle> she was two steps away a second ago LUL

[0:55:37] <%JobbedBone> ignore slides, acquire potential energy
[0:55:37] <$Sphincter_Spelunker> and my axe
[0:55:42] <danknugglit> The weapon art is dope
[0:55:43] <%Velociraptor_Cleftes> it blurs the line between hammer and axe, tbh
[0:55:43] <lotharrio> Big axe prayers
[0:55:50] <sirrice77> need 15 faith tho
[0:55:51] <%AncelDeLambert> oh it needs Faith, lol
[0:55:51] <rudiciuscaesar> did it use faith?
[0:55:55] <%patriotrenegade> its good
[0:56:02] <+MisterAvry> gotta have faith
[0:56:03] <+Axellogic> its a super rad axe tho
[0:56:03] <+realm_forge> AND MY AXE
[0:56:04] <RushUnplugged> yeah it needs 15 fth but it's a pretty good weapon
[0:56:04] <%Monkeyweed21> you need a little faith in THE PLAN
[0:56:08] <%peyodogo> the weapon art is real cool
[0:56:11] <%patriotrenegade> naw you get all the items
[0:56:31] <%KeiganOfAstora> @PeachSaliva How do you feel about Greataxes instead of Great Hammers? You've done a Greatsword build already. There's even Halberds too!
[0:56:32] <benjiFG> the main path is somwhere left in general
[0:56:37] <%JenovasPuppet> Generally speaking, just go up
[0:56:43] <%Velociraptor_Cleftes> you got it! back, straight, right, and right
[0:56:48] <RushUnplugged> got left across the cliff and then it turns right
[0:56:49] <$Sphincter_Spelunker> dig up stupid
[0:56:51] <%patriotrenegade> DIG UP
[0:56:51] <+DrMcDreamy108> What a fun area to explore.
[0:56:58] <%KeiganOfAstora> @Sphincter_Spelunker There it is!
[0:57:12] <%dankjerri> everybody do your share
[0:57:16] <rudiciuscaesar> "No you come out."
[0:57:17] <+FoolsArcade> You gotta go left to go up @PeachSaliva
[0:57:25] <CandyCoatedConfection> 🎶 clean up clean up, everybody do your share 🎶
[0:57:26] <+MisterAvry> bork
[0:57:26] <%KeiganOfAstora> HERE!
[0:57:27] <%Gloom_Tangerine> Does anyone know what the other weapon Paige is going for? I've heard her mention it, but have no idea what it is.
[0:57:27] <+FoolsArcade> you found it
[0:57:38] <%freelancebabymaker> friede scythe
[0:57:42] <%doomunderthestairs> man the clean up song lots memories
[0:57:43] <Jaysky> Awoo spotted
[0:57:58] <+MisterAvry> pup snuffed
[0:58:02] <maxpasta> Wowee
[0:58:03] <DanThePumpkinman> i think "Dig up stupid" is my favourite simpsons line
[0:58:08] <%KeiganOfAstora> Friede's Scythe for Ringed City
[0:58:08] <BigYanno> iirc the path is small and to the left
[0:58:16] <@PatStaresAt> I can't believe how fast she's doing this
[0:58:19] <%JobbedBone> my bologna
[0:58:22] <%freelancebabymaker> was that brodyquest lol
[0:58:24] <%dankjerri> shes saving Odo
[0:58:25] <+Emperor_Machinus> that torch is special
[0:58:26] <CandyCoatedConfection> no one can believe it
[0:58:27] <%Gloom_Tangerine> @freelancebabymaker got it, makes sense. thank you! sorry to be a bother.
[0:58:28] <%SveriSageAdvice> she is absolutely acing this content
[0:58:31] <PartyFavors> NICE
[0:58:34] <BigYanno> yeah this dlc FUCKED ME UP on my first playthrough
[0:58:35] <%AncelDeLambert> awooga
[0:58:37] <valerios_> OhMyDog
[0:58:45] <%graemecrackers2> Furries unite!
[0:58:48] <%KeiganOfAstora> @PatStaresAt It's kinda like it's not that hard in the first place if you just take your time and methodically kill everything
[0:58:53] <+MisterAvry> @PatStaresAt she's good at dark souls now
[0:58:54] <+Archphronimos> puppers snuffed
[0:58:55] <Sestren413> She's just bullying the wolves at this point
[0:58:58] <%KeiganOfAstora> It's when she freaks out that she has trouble
[0:59:01] <@PatStaresAt> Is she better than meee
[0:59:06] <+ThomasOfTroy> Yes
[0:59:06] <%freelancebabymaker> yes
[0:59:06] <BigYanno> yes
[0:59:07] <%dankjerri> yes
[0:59:07] <%king_wragles> She's doing better than I did and I SAW A PLAYTHROUGH before I did this area
[0:59:07] <rudiciuscaesar> I had no idea "dig up stupid" was from the Simpsons
[0:59:08] <valerios_> yes
[0:59:09] <%Agami23> local foxgirl shows wolves who's the alpha dog around here.
[0:59:09] <shotgang86> yes
[0:59:10] <%Velociraptor_Cleftes> yeah
[0:59:13] <%KeiganOfAstora> ONLY ONE WAY TO FIND OUT. PvP!!!!
[0:59:14] <+MisterAvry> brutal
[0:59:19] <fruit_pie_the_magician> Hammer is better than you, Pat
[0:59:20] <jetpack_rorschasch> yes
[0:59:24] <RushUnplugged> it's really a straight path, just winded, and she's just outmacing everything
[0:59:29] <Coystick> U, and I cannot stress this enough, wU
[0:59:29] <%king_wragles> @PatStaresAt At the very least, the hammer is
[0:59:29] <+MisterAvry> yeah you're gonna have to invade Paige, Pat
[0:59:31] <%KeiganOfAstora> I totally wanna see PvP between Paige and Pat
[0:59:31] <%AncelDeLambert> BOOM
[0:59:31] <%dankjerri> @keiganofastora i second the fiancé pvp
[0:59:32] <+ThomasOfTroy> Literally as soon as she starts playing it regularly, she gets WAY better, which makes sense
[0:59:32] <%JobbedBone> girlboss fox puts sigma wolves in their place
[0:59:34] <danknugglit> Shes better and shes blind
[0:59:40] <EuropanLamprey> I think Friede Scythe is a bad move for her since  it's a 180 degrees from the weapon she's using and it's a weapon that lives by its weapon art and hits certain enemies like wet paper due to split damage
[0:59:47] <%AncelDeLambert> YAAAAAY SHE LEARNS!
[0:59:47] <%KeiganOfAstora> Pat, start invading her ASAP
[0:59:54] <CandyCoatedConfection> fucking sick bro
[1:00:01] <rudiciuscaesar> wait, is Paige not even embered? I just saw her health value and assumed she was....
[1:00:02] <%dankjerri> invade your wife, pat
[1:00:03] <@PatStaresAt> Yeah Europan she'll obviously try the thing out first before sweitchin'
[1:00:06] <%king_wragles> @EuropanLamprey counter point: Paige does the Unga Bunga
[1:00:12] <RushUnplugged> KICK TREE
[1:00:14] <%Velociraptor_Cleftes> we've come a long way from Paige_vs_Archer.mp4
[1:00:15] <+MisterAvry> being leveled tf out so she can unga fkn bunga helps
[1:00:17] <BigFingerRo> Oh! that's right! she hasn't been invaded once here!
[1:00:17] <%AncelDeLambert> she's embered
[1:00:21] <BigYanno> Tree 2
[1:00:28] <rudiciuscaesar> aw, tree herpes
[1:00:29] <+MisterAvry> good job tree
[1:00:32] <%AncelDeLambert> remember to look next to the health bar to see if someone's embered
[1:00:33] <EuropanLamprey> @king_wragles and scythe is as far from unga bunga as you can be
[1:00:40] <+DrMcDreamy108> Oh wow this is a new area.
[1:00:40] <rudiciuscaesar> oh oyu can see it on her veil.

[1:04:07] <%AncelDeLambert> @PeachSaliva you should probably grab the NORMAL torch from your item box
[1:04:07] <benjiFG> you should go to the ash lady and buy an actual torch
[1:04:07] <$Sphincter_Spelunker> and that's the way we wash our hands
[1:04:08] <catalystoffire> Why does Pat's voice sound deeper than a Knight in Warcraft Tides of Darkness lol
[1:04:15] <%KeiganOfAstora> I love that moment in the Dark Souls LP when Woolie finds his first shortcut back to the bonfire

[1:04:28] <%KeiganOfAstora> It's like 2 hours for most peopel
[1:04:29] <Treasure_Vault> It is short, but the difficulty usually makes it longer.
[1:04:30] <%Monkeyweed21> you ran through A LOT

[1:06:21] <%KeiganOfAstora> She could buy the normal torch at Firelink which is lighter. Might still be under 70% with that
[1:06:34] <%GabeSweetMan> Smooches!
[1:06:34] <ArdentSlacker> Gotta say, it is impressive how they managed to make flies WORSE.
[1:06:39] <+MisterAvry> you got the worms

[1:10:29] <valerios_> NotLikeThis
[1:10:32] <fruit_pie_the_magician> Luckily, she unequipped the torch again
[1:10:32] <Treasure_Vault> Buy a normal torch from handmaiden
[1:10:35] <%GabeSweetMan> Just keep the torch on. You don't need the stamina recovery for these guys.
[1:10:36] <Bennett_Fracture> i was hopping for a no death day...
[1:10:39] <Dr_Mooose> beat a boss first try...and died to bugs
[1:10:41] <+realm_forge> Make sure to aggro every enemy then go into your menu
[1:10:43] <%AncelDeLambert> @PeachSaliva the regular torch is lighter than the Follower's Torch, it's in your bonfire storage box
[1:10:44] <%graemecrackers2> Fly my pretties
[1:10:49] <%freelancebabymaker> JUST KEEP THE TORCH EQUIPPED
[1:10:51] <+Pendragwn> sad paige
[1:10:52] <%Lion_kun> paige, either keep the torch on and accept a fat roll for that one stage or take off an armor piece
[1:10:57] <%freelancebabymaker> YOU DONT NEED TO ROLL DOWN THERE
[1:10:59] <$Sphincter_Spelunker> Happy marriage as she cries
[1:11:00] <%KeiganOfAstora> Dude, she never got it
[1:11:01] <%Velociraptor_Cleftes> @Dr_Mooose that's what happened when she listened to Pat!
[1:11:02] <%JobbedBone> bonfire box
[1:11:02] <sirrice77> @PeachSaliva if i'm being perfectly honest im gonna suggest just ignoring all the flies and just run around trying to find the switch which is on a pillar
[1:11:04] <%AncelDeLambert> much cry
[1:11:05] <Dunmarkh> NotLikeThis
[1:11:06] <%KeiganOfAstora> She needs to go back to Firelink to buy it
[1:11:06] <%AncelDeLambert> BONFIRE BOX
[1:11:09] <+SuperFineButtHairs> oh
[1:11:13] <%king_wragles> Sad Peach Model activate!
[1:11:14] <M0untain_wolf> SAD?
[1:11:16] <%KeiganOfAstora> Ah maybe in there but I don't think she ever bought one
[1:11:17] <Bennett_Fracture> no death run ruined...
[1:11:18] <shotgang86> sad
[1:11:18] <%Sotetsu> Is that area bugging you?
[1:11:24] <%Bane_Kaikyo> Or she could just wear lighter gloves?
[1:11:26] <Bennett_Fracture> i feel like its my fault...
[1:11:26] <benjiFG> it's a weapon
[1:11:29] <%KeiganOfAstora> Go to weapons

[1:11:38] <benjiFG> press Y
[1:11:40] <%JobbedBone> right pane

[1:11:46] <%JobbedBone> firelink
[1:11:47] <%KeiganOfAstora> Yea no torch

[1:11:54] <%AncelDeLambert> huh, I swore you got a freebie
[1:11:57] <%Idziman> it's 300 souls

[1:12:05] <%Fooguwu> oh, she had one but pat didnt re-buy it i bet
[1:12:18] <%king_wragles> It'll be like buying a pen for you basically
[1:12:18] <%AncelDeLambert> and if not her then Greyrat has it
[1:12:20] <$Sphincter_Spelunker> or right the PC switch
[1:12:28] <%GabeSweetMan> Oh right you reset!
[1:12:32] <%AncelDeLambert> ooooooooh okay
[1:12:33] <%KeiganOfAstora> Prisoner's Chain is also not really doing much now that her stats are much higher. Switch it for Havel's Ring for more equip load @PeachSaliva
[1:12:35] <%dankjerri> paige still cry
[1:12:37] <%Sotetsu> Not the Switch, the PS4
[1:12:38] <%GabeSweetMan> That makes total sense.

[1:13:31] <$Sphincter_Spelunker> not sponge worthy
[1:13:33] <robosqueeb> i just use saran wrap
[1:13:33] <%MarylandJutsu> PAT is GREGNANT

[1:13:40] <+ghostfaceninja_> wait did Pat think....
[1:13:40] <rudiciuscaesar> lmao SPONGE!?
[1:13:41] <%JenovasPuppet> @FiresideInternetCafe Yeah
[1:13:42] <%AncelDeLambert> it's a large profalactic that is inserted into the vagina
[1:13:42] <%Supermonaman> What.
[1:13:44] <robosqueeb> sponge totally still exists
[1:13:44] <%freelancebabymaker> what are we talking about
[1:13:46] <DanThePumpkinman> yo we talking mpreg?
[1:13:48] <HaroldDonchee> gotta have the sponge
[1:13:52] <%KeiganOfAstora> Put torch in left hand
[1:13:53] <%dankjerri> sponges just SOAKED in spermicide and yes pat they still exist
[1:13:54] <benjiFG> put the torch in the left hand
[1:13:55] <$Sphincter_Spelunker> gotta sop it up
[1:13:55] <+RealThiele> clearly seinfeld is 100% accurate
[1:13:56] <+whyskeywolfe> there's no such thing as a condom
[1:14:03] <jetpack_rorschasch> Guys, Pat's not fat and lazy, he's just pregnant. Kappa
[1:14:03] <%KeiganOfAstora> Left hand is better, she can leave it out and still swing hammer
[1:14:09] <%dankjerri> @patstaresat sponges absolutely still exist
[1:14:12] <%freelancebabymaker> we dont use condoms here in this stream
[1:14:21] <+ThomasOfTroy> Pornstars still use sponges, but they sometimes forget to take them out. Apparently, it's fucking AWFUL
[1:14:21] <+RealThiele> just hammer her sponge in
[1:14:22] <%MechArch> sponge up the nut
[1:14:22] <Ethel9727> The splooge sponge?
[1:14:23] <peachy996> spongebob keep it in your pants
[1:14:24] <benjiFG> also when you put the torch up when it's in your left hand it makes it brighter
[1:14:27] <%Monkeyweed21> what about a mini vacuum?
[1:14:29] <%GalacticaPhanto> The Goo Must Flow
[1:14:29] <%dankjerri> i used them like last week
[1:14:31] <robosqueeb> it protects the cervix from beeg pokes
[1:14:37] <+SuperFineButtHairs> Spongedong Nopregnantpants
[1:14:40] <+Pendragwn> never
[1:14:43] <%Fooguwu> that are 30 years old
[1:14:50] <%dankjerri> jerry seinfeld has never fucked
[1:14:50] <%CantWalkGood> Next do a no shield/caestus run!!
[1:14:56] <peachy996> Elaine Benes WOULD lie to you
[1:14:56] <%JobbedBone> THEY WERE ON A BREAK
[1:14:57] <+whyskeywolfe> You can still look to Rick and Morty though.
[1:15:01] <MarsKarl> I do not like that noise that is terrifying
[1:15:01] <%GabeSweetMan> Borf
[1:15:04] <%patriotrenegade> your comedy show is also like 30 years old Pat
[1:15:05] <%Bane_Kaikyo> @Monkeyweed21 isn't that what a douche is?
[1:15:07] <jackalias> I know they're probably small makeup sponges, buy I'm picturing someone using a loofah
[1:15:07] <%KeiganOfAstora> not really
[1:15:09] <+RealThiele> i mean the cast of seinfeld were habitual liars too
[1:15:15] <%JobbedBone> ROSS DID NOTHING WRONG
[1:15:15] <+FiresideInternetCafe> Yeah Elaine is a known liar Pat
[1:15:19] <Bennett_Fracture> drew carey show bench watch tonight...
[1:15:27] <benjiFG> in the room Kappa

[1:15:35] <+DrMcDreamy108> kill the flies
[1:15:39] <%KeiganOfAstora> Like a pirate ship wheel
[1:15:39] <+RealThiele> IM HELPING!
[1:15:42] <%GabeSweetMan> UNGA ONLY
[1:15:44] <+FiresideInternetCafe> This was better!
[1:15:48] <EMP_Ike_Turner> Elaine was a liar but she was hot so it’s morally gray.
[1:15:49] <benjiFG> god that veil is awesome
[1:15:49] <NiftyNox> brute smarts!
[1:15:50] <%freelancebabymaker> no it NEEDS to be harder
[1:15:50] <%dankjerri> an anchor winch
[1:15:50] <robosqueeb> dont mind the worm -cranks whel-
[1:15:52] <%KeiganOfAstora> No worries, she has no souls to lose. She can die yea
[1:15:53] <$Sphincter_Spelunker> just like the other Painted world
[1:15:56] <Treasure_Vault> Don't forget the illusory wall down here
[1:15:57] <%JobbedBone> allons-y~
[1:16:02] <%GabeSweetMan> Good luck EVER finding that bloodstain.
[1:16:02] <+SuperFineButtHairs> lady
[1:16:02] <fruit_pie_the_magician> Now you can just die
[1:16:03] <%Agami23> that armor you just got is the sexy man who was infront of the churchs armor
[1:16:06] <rudiciuscaesar> man, she must be bored, just sitting there all day.
[1:16:06] <+realm_forge> Paige MUST aggro the entire room
[1:16:07] <+transporterthesequel> Paige YOU MUST BE BIG AND STRONG
[1:16:07] <+FiresideInternetCafe> Oh shit didI join stream at the perfect time??
[1:16:09] <AthenaAegis> Almost time for PAIN
[1:16:10] <+Archphronimos> BIG AND STRONG STILL
[1:16:11] <Coystick> A little
[1:16:16] <Treasure_Vault> Very cool illusory wall down here.
[1:16:17] <%WhereIsWill> it really will LUL
[1:16:21] <MarsKarl> she's pretty tsundere about it
[1:16:21] <%GabeSweetMan> Hi DS1 reference.
[1:16:22] <ToneBacas> she told you to leave
[1:16:22] <Dr_Mooose> "this mothatrucker"
[1:16:26] <danknugglit> She hates references
[1:16:28] <%Sotetsu> You turned her statue. sipsipRude
[1:16:29] <+SuperFineButtHairs> bye pat
[1:16:30] <%KeiganOfAstora> @PeachSaliva The armor you just picked up has assless chaps
[1:16:36] <+MisterAvry> she is a mother fucker
[1:16:37] <$Sphincter_Spelunker> I would
[1:16:37] <%AncelDeLambert> THIS BOSS SUCKS
[1:16:39] <EuropanLamprey> I will
[1:16:39] <%Sotetsu> Don't summon heeelp
[1:16:39] <+babushkakoi> Time for Church
[1:16:40] <Treasure_Vault> Illusory wall and ember.
[1:16:40] <%KeiganOfAstora> Summon help
[1:16:42] <Eightesu> i will
[1:16:42] <+RealThiele> come back when humorous to do so pat
[1:16:43] <+MisterAvry> roll toward her
[1:16:43] <Woodywoo0100> I will /s
[1:16:45] <+ThomasOfTroy> Any chance for emote mode? I feel like chat gonna get real backseaty and spoilery
[1:16:45] <%JobbedBone> try it
[1:16:45] <MarsKarl> aw at least let her try
[1:16:45] <+transporterthesequel> This is literally the hardest boss in Souls
[1:16:46] <%WhereIsWill> call the goons
[1:16:48] <%AncelDeLambert> He's as fucking bad as ANYTHING in the Bloodborne DLC
[1:16:48] <%doomunderthestairs> not right off the bat go at a few gos
[1:16:49] <%g0atmeal> She might just crush it tbh
[1:16:50] <Eightesu> no summoning
[1:16:50] <Treasure_Vault> Not vital wall, but neat.
[1:16:50] <laserbeaming> this boss is fucked up
[1:16:50] <Ethel9727> I will. I believe in strong Paige
[1:16:51] <%peyodogo> try on your own a few times
[1:16:51] <fluffy_sauce> what at the npc she can fight?
[1:16:51] <%GabeSweetMan> She unga'd Nameless though so...
[1:16:51] <+FiresideInternetCafe> Yeah this is a co-op boss imo. Give it a few tries on your own so you can get it, but it is HARD.
[1:16:53] <AthenaAegis> GOOD FUCKING LUCK is my advice lmao
[1:16:53] <+bubblebasspickles> just don;t die lol
[1:16:55] <robosqueeb> this boss fucks
[1:16:55] <%freelancebabymaker> gael is your friend let him help
[1:16:56] <%graemecrackers2> Swing away
[1:16:57] <%Sotetsu> At least try to kill it.
[1:17:01] <Rionxgarland> im here to watch the disaster
[1:17:01] <+MisterAvry> I've been stuck on this fucker for two weeks
[1:17:03] <+transporterthesequel> Like no hyperbole, this is the pinnacle.
[1:17:04] <%peyodogo> but when you do beat it, yeah, if you have friends over it's whatever
[1:17:05] <%GabeSweetMan> If she can unga Nameless, she can do this, I believe!
[1:17:06] <%doomunderthestairs> this boss is great
[1:17:06] <+realm_forge> IT IS TIME. THE ULTIMATE UNGA BUNGA VS ULTIMATE DEXTERITY
[1:17:08] <amonimis> rip souls
[1:17:09] <TheOpinionater> just keep rollin rollin rollin
[1:17:11] <%AncelDeLambert> that said, there's still the OPTIONAL area down here
[1:17:14] <+MooseIsGoose> you picked up my favorite armor
[1:17:16] <%JenovasPuppet> My moto is: If the boss gets two people, so do you!
[1:17:17] <fluffy_sauce> she can go farther down
[1:17:20] <poisin224> clean
[1:17:21] <%KeiganOfAstora> That works
[1:17:21] <jetpack_rorschasch> There will be no shame with this motherfucker.
[1:17:25] <%femto216> This is the only Boss that I needed Co-Op and I'm not ashamed about it
[1:17:27] <Treasure_Vault> The optional area down there is rad.
[1:17:28] <brisk_dacat> Those guys were..Pretty FLY
[1:17:30] <%GabeSweetMan> @realm_forge Yup, you nailed it. This boss IS the ultimate dex build.
[1:17:34] <%Supermonaman> Try by yourself 1st if you want.
[1:17:35] <AthenaAegis> Fucking GREAT fight though
[1:17:36] <%JobbedBone> shut up chat LUL
[1:17:38] <%GabeSweetMan> Teleport guy
[1:17:40] <benjiFG> the guy  that sucked you
[1:17:41] <%JobbedBone> bump
[1:17:42] <+realm_forge> IT IS TIME FOR HIDS TO CLASH
[1:17:42] <DXLelouch24> I beat her without help, ill shame you forever Paige.
[1:17:43] <+OdysseyKnight> The hobo knight
[1:17:45] <%AncelDeLambert> what's the optional area in Vanilla? My brain is permanently corrupted by Cinders
[1:17:46] <+transporterthesequel> Yeah it's my favorite fight in the series
[1:17:47] <+realm_forge> GODS
[1:17:49] <%freelancebabymaker> it was a while ago
[1:17:49] <%Fooguwu> summoning might just make it harder because of the health increase and how long the fight is
[1:17:51] <Treasure_Vault> @PeachSaliva There's another illusory wall down in the bug pit.
[1:17:54] <Eightesu> he's a good man
[1:18:05] <%KeiganOfAstora> Once again it is time for Paige to defeat a woman @PeachSaliva
[1:18:09] <TheCrispyBoi> he good boy
[1:18:10] <%king_wragles> I swear, if she just one shots this
[1:18:11] <sirrice77> @DXLelouch24 I beat her alone at SL1. Does this mean i can shame you now?
[1:18:16] <%AncelDeLambert> oh, and you can talk to the kid upstairs
[1:18:18] <@PatStaresAt> @king_wragles THERE IS NO FUCKING WAY
[1:18:21] <%KeiganOfAstora> @Treasure_Vault Leads tow hat?
[1:18:23] <fluffy_sauce> theres another area to explore
[1:18:23] <+FiresideInternetCafe> Would Paige go online? Or do y'all avoid that after your online stream when DS3 released?
[1:18:25] <%king_wragles> DUDE YOU DON'T KNOW THAT
[1:18:29] <+transporterthesequel> There is like, a 50% chance your summoned help dies within the first 5 minutes and just makes it harder
[1:18:31] <%GabeSweetMan> I will SHIT if she one shots.
[1:18:36] <+MisterAvry> she's gonna 2 shot this
[1:18:37] <pabloelenano2> 1,2
[1:18:42] <%WhereIsWill> @king_wragles gonna have to agree with wragles on this one LUL
[1:18:42] <%graemecrackers2> 1 shot this shit
[1:18:46] <%baronblank> I will be in utter shock if she beats this first try
[1:18:47] <Treasure_Vault> @KeiganOfAstora DS1 reference and an npc invader
[1:18:48] <+McSoliace> if she one shots this we all have the tiniest balls
[1:18:49] <+RealThiele> empty the boobs
[1:18:51] <%graemecrackers2> 1 2
[1:18:54] <AthenaAegis> I would shit solid gold bricks if she first try'd this lmao
[1:18:54] <$Sphincter_Spelunker> SourPls
[1:18:57] <DXLelouch24> Pat why must you baby your wife? She can do it.
[1:18:57] <+Axellogic> She's gonna empty her power and focus into the toilet
[1:19:00] <maxpasta> SourPls
[1:19:00] <shotgang86> Pee is stored in the boobs
[1:19:02] <Treasure_Vault> Not that she'd remember it,iguess.
[1:19:04] <+transporterthesequel> There is literally no way. I can't even fathom it.
[1:19:04] <%patriotrenegade> Dunnel and Priscilla's tower isnt really worth it
[1:19:07] <+MisterAvry> she's going to make us all look like chumps
[1:19:12] <HaroldDonchee> hope she doesn't accidentally hit the npc
[1:19:12] <%WhereIsWill> itll be 10x worse than ebrietas if she one shots this
[1:19:14] <TurtlesAndTentacles> start the count
[1:19:16] <+SuperFineButtHairs> chibi pat
[1:19:22] <+MisterAvry> are you all ready? to look like chumps?
[1:19:28] <Dr_Mooose> bets, place ya bets!
[1:19:33] <+RealThiele> too late! im already a chump
[1:19:36] <shotgang86> -> baby sipsipElmo
[1:19:37] <%dankjerri> 3 tries
[1:19:40] <+realm_forge> This is going to be a clash of opposing gameplay styles that will shake the earth
[1:19:42] <fruit_pie_the_magician> I beat this in like three tries on NG+4
[1:19:45] <%patriotrenegade> I was on NG+ when I first fought Friede. And then I was NG++ when I fought Gael.
[1:19:49] <+transporterthesequel> I have killed this boss with every bog standard build in the game. It was a motherfucker each and every time.
[1:19:52] <TurtlesAndTentacles> I say she gets to the 3rd phase but dies to it
[1:20:02] <fruit_pie_the_magician> She can absolutely facetank the first two forms
[1:20:02] <%Velociraptor_Cleftes> I swear, if she beats this first try, we all have to sub for a full year
[1:20:05] <AthenaAegis> @WhereIsWill Pat would officially retire from Soulsborne if she first try'd this Kappa
[1:20:10] <%Bane_Kaikyo> How the hell do you beat DS3 without bonfires? I mean Curse-Rotted Greatwood litterally forces you to use one to get out of the boss room....
[1:20:12] <DXLelouch24> Gaels just gonna make it harder cause more hp
[1:20:13] <+transporterthesequel> DLC2's superboss is easier imo.
[1:20:17] <%GabeSweetMan> Unga Bunga is STRONG in this playthrough but I'll never touch a souls game again if she one shots this.
[1:20:18] <%KeiganOfAstora> @Treasure_Vault Oh yea
[1:20:19] <Zero_Jacks> lytCLAP
[1:20:19] <BigYanno> I say she gets flustered by phase 2 and dies to it
[1:20:28] <%Supermonaman> Yeah that sounds about right @TurtlesAndTentacles
[1:20:29] <%patriotrenegade> Curse-Rotted is optional tho
[1:20:30] <+megaman_sentinel> why does the song sound familiar
[1:20:30] <$Sphincter_Spelunker> Curse rot is optional
[1:20:33] <shotgang86> To me its the worst sequence of events this boss fight. Not as hard as Midir, but up there
[1:20:38] <%GalacticaPhanto> waiting for nodes to pop in FF14 is the worst
[1:20:42] <DXLelouch24> Phase 3 WILL kill her

[1:34:20] <+whyskeywolfe> Extravert Fokksu did very well.
[1:34:20] <%Epic_Fubar> that was a SOLID first attempted
[1:34:20] <%MarylandJutsu> YOU ARE SO BIG AND STRONG
[1:34:20] <$Chatterbox1991> so fight Ornstein and Smough THAN the Bloodborne last boss
[1:34:21] <JasonPlaysStylishly> Phase 3 on first try amazing
[1:34:21] <laserbeaming> that last one is the real boss
[1:34:22] <blue8moon> Big good job
[1:34:25] <%peyodogo> YOU CAN SUPER KEEP GOING WITHOUT SUMMONING, NO SHAME IF YOU DO BUT
[1:34:26] <shotgang86> that was good and GOOD LORD THAT DAMAGE
[1:34:29] <Sol_Install> That was theh best first attempt i've seen for that boss
[1:34:30] <%JobbedBone> likes like maria + ornstein and smough?
[1:34:30] <+Archphronimos> that was legit amazing
[1:34:33] <AthenaAegis> FIRST TWO PHASES on the FIRST TRY! FUCKING AMAZING! PogChamp
[1:34:33] <+thatgirlpossessed> you can do it alone
[1:34:41] <+tigerfang86> HEARS BEFORE SHE SEES
[1:34:42] <+MisterAvry> you can see where she lands if you look
[1:34:42] <%g0atmeal> this is my fav part of the franchise. that was an awesome attempt
[1:34:42] <Sol_Install> Like, you had the best i've seen for that boss
[1:34:45] <BigYanno> she always jumps DIRECTLY behind you
[1:34:51] <%Velociraptor_Cleftes> No summon needed, you totally got this!
[1:34:55] <+FoolsArcade> you can see her footsteps in the snow too
[1:34:59] <DXLelouch24> @peachsaliva You can do it alone,Pats just babying you
[1:35:03] <+FiresideInternetCafe> You do way more damage to big man too.
[1:35:04] <+MisterAvry> She can also dash to the sides, but that looks different
[1:35:04] <%peyodogo> shit i gotta go grab food but theres a fair chance she'll get it next try lmfao
[1:35:06] <%MarylandJutsu> @PeachSaliva you need to smoke a cigarette?
[1:35:08] <%GabeSweetMan> You can unga super hard in that phase. Also the bowl slam has a MASSIVE range. Run INTO him to doge it.
[1:35:09] <jetpack_rorschasch> It took me days to beat this boss paige, so you're doing amazing right now! SeemsGood
[1:35:10] <+RealThiele> get up grandpas ass
[1:35:12] <%AncelDeLambert> she was actually doing REALLY well focusing Friede
[1:35:13] <$Sphincter_Spelunker> @PeachSaliva The big charges in a straight line too. Think of him as a train
[1:35:13] <+transporterthesequel> Doing it alone is 100% the play
[1:35:17] <VritraReiRei> @PeachSaliva you did AMAZING first try. ONE ADVICE: watch your stamina, you were swinging with no Stamina
[1:35:23] <Jmann1892> Its easier to hit the big guy but her lust for woman murder won't let her
[1:35:26] <+tigerfang86> Miracle builds bepREE
[1:35:27] <%JobbedBone> a lot of times hes moving away from you if you're trying to hit his back
[1:35:28] <+Kemmybelle> That was amazing Paige. Good job.
[1:35:29] <%graemecrackers2> Bop her
[1:35:31] <%JobbedBone> it may have whiffed
[1:35:32] <%SveriSageAdvice> it even looked like you were doing significantly more damage to him than to her, he might have a blunt damage weakness
[1:35:32] <Bennett_Fracture> yo paige... try to audition for the next awesome game done quick...
[1:35:33] <+transporterthesequel> Gael does not justify the extra health with how hard Paige is swingin.
[1:35:36] <+tigerfang86> friede investing in faith points
[1:35:38] <%freelancebabymaker> no you totally do way more damage to him
[1:35:40] <+FoolsArcade> the life bar totally moved when you hit him
[1:35:41] <fruit_pie_the_magician> You hit them both simultaneously, and it fucked like half their life bar
[1:35:44] <%AncelDeLambert> @PeachSaliva so hey there's a ladder to your left
[1:35:50] <+FiresideInternetCafe> You can defo do this with no summons with that try. Phase 3 is mad, mad hard though.
[1:35:51] <ferbeholds> you played amazing there paige
[1:35:53] <+transporterthesequel> Yeah that was so rad
[1:35:57] <%KeiganOfAstora> @PeachSaliva Attack the big guy in Phase 2. You were doing more damage to him
[1:35:57] <+MisterAvry> you did

[1:36:49] <+BennyBiscuits13> She's nice, leave her alone
[1:36:49] <%Sotetsu> Don't hurt her, she is an angel
[1:36:51] <Coystick> Fun fact, her gestures here are the longest single animation in the whole series
[1:36:53] <%g0atmeal> i will call it "elden ring"
[1:36:56] <%Velociraptor_Cleftes> She's painting Bloodborne!
[1:36:58] <+MisterAvry> I like when kids in games aren't little shits
[1:37:00] <%freelancebabymaker> what does vaati like to call this girl? aria?
[1:37:00] <%GabeSweetMan> I love her VA.
[1:37:01] <Jaysky> Goodly
[1:37:01] <%AncelDeLambert> WE DON'T NEED NO WATER LET THE MOTHAFUCKA BURN
[1:37:03] <%JenovasPuppet> Only kill women! Do not kill girls!
[1:37:11] <%Sotetsu> Braid her hair
[1:37:17] <%GabeSweetMan> She is underage. Not on Paige's murderadar.
[1:37:18] <mr_saturday93> See flame? Show her a 🔦
[1:37:19] <Eightesu> Also immortal she can't be hit
[1:37:22] <%doomunderthestairs> I forget is she blind as well?
[1:37:25] <%GabeSweetMan> Paige only kills vvymen.
[1:37:26] <$Quack_of_Dawn> So she's making a painted world in here
[1:37:31] <+MisterAvry> YOU are scary
[1:37:31] <%doomunderthestairs> yeah right?
[1:37:40] <%Fooguwu> She also has dragon-like features
[1:37:40] <+MisterAvry> boss should be scared of you
[1:37:40] <%patriotrenegade> Yeah, go ahead and kill her
[1:37:41] <%g0atmeal> that might be for story reasons but idk
[1:37:42] <+transporterthesequel> Friede is a...slight spoiler
[1:37:42] <ergulor> where do you summon your ally?
[1:37:45] <%freelancebabymaker> @doomunderthestairs no but she is like a crossbreed or something
[1:37:46] <+Dundee15> still coming down from that adrenaline.
[1:37:50] <%Monkeyweed21> she is a child so she is videogame immortal
[1:37:51] <ArdentSlacker> ... who *isn't* immortal? It's a game about undead and undying peeps?
[1:37:52] <+transporterthesequel> Lets just say you and her are alike
[1:37:57] <Treasure_Vault> She's probably gonna struggle all night, call it quits, and first try it next time
[1:37:58] <%doomunderthestairs> yeah that I remember
[1:37:58] <rosemon5001> she is tiny and paige doesnt percive her as a threat thats why she lives LUL
[1:38:05] <TheOpinionater> summon friendo?
[1:38:07] <TurtlesAndTentacles> The lore behind Friede is pretty tight
[1:38:08] <$Quack_of_Dawn> @Treasure_Vault That's the Paige way
[1:38:14] <CandyCoatedConfection> what if this world is destroyed? then doesn't her painted world get destroyed too?
[1:38:15] <%JobbedBone> OH YE OF LITTLE FAITH
[1:38:18] <%Velociraptor_Cleftes> tbh the summon would just dilute Paige's strength
[1:38:19] <+transporterthesequel> @TurtlesAndTentacles it's freakin rad
[1:38:22] <%GabeSweetMan> @Treasure_Vault That's a fair guess given the trajectory of this LP.
[1:38:22] <Tahzani> You got this
[1:38:24] <%freelancebabymaker> lol
[1:38:28] <Profmcstevie> Her blood is ours and OURS ALONE
[1:38:29] <%patriotrenegade> oh do behave Kappa
[1:38:29] <%WhereIsWill> lets gooo then!
[1:38:29] <$Sphincter_Spelunker> man, I'm hungry too, but I'm afraid Paige is gonna wreck this boss
[1:38:29] <laserbeaming> Maybe ember just for extra health
[1:38:31] <+MisterAvry> you don't need a summon
[1:38:33] <DanThePumpkinman> you can do the thing Paige! We believe in you!
[1:38:37] <$Quack_of_Dawn> No diluting this woman murder by sharing it
[1:38:47] <%GabeSweetMan> Remember to stay in the frost Paige! She's never expect it!
[1:38:48] <+MisterAvry> directly behind
[1:38:48] <%JobbedBone> you can ember mid-fight for a free full heal
[1:38:49] <benjiFG> *gasp*
[1:38:58] <%doomunderthestairs> that's the way get em peach
[1:38:59] <+AbnormalVoid> you need headphones
[1:39:03] <Coystick> It's doing me heaps of favors :^)
[1:39:05] <%JobbedBone> lef
[1:39:07] <$Sphincter_Spelunker> @AbnormalVoid she do
[1:39:08] <acridpaladin> She always jumps behind you to the left or right
[1:39:12] <+AbnormalVoid> ah lol
[1:39:13] <+MisterAvry> yeah listening is a bad idea. spin 180 and look for the puff of snow when she lands
[1:39:18] <BigYanno> She jumps directly behind where you are looking when she jumps
[1:39:18] <%vVAstrAVv> the direction of the snow when she jumps helped me
[1:39:20] <Dunmarkh> getting distracted by her feetsies? you really are a souls fan.
[1:39:23] <fruit_pie_the_magician> You can also just run in the direction she jumps
[1:39:26] <HawkHollywood> she always jumps directly behind you so when she cloaks just go the opposite direction
[1:39:29] <benjiFG> LUL
[1:39:32] <%freelancebabymaker> oh she saw her
[1:39:32] <Dr_Mooose> ok?
[1:39:33] <danknugglit> You have to hear so you can see paige
[1:39:34] <%WhereIsWill> get fucked
[1:39:34] <%freelancebabymaker> nice
[1:39:35] <LoneFonte> good shit
[1:39:39] <%GabeSweetMan> You're alright for estus.
[1:39:39] <$Quack_of_Dawn> Good first phase
[1:39:40] <%Sotetsu> Piece of cake
[1:39:45] <Jaysky> WutFace
[1:39:45] <TurtlesAndTentacles> She always jumps directly behind, I learned something today
[1:39:51] <%GabeSweetMan> Go unga on Dad.
[1:39:53] <$Sphincter_Spelunker> nothing personnel
[1:39:54] <+Axellogic> Its amazing that her learned habit of just maddly rolling everywhere is somehow working
[1:40:00] <DanThePumpkinman> time for MORE SOUP
[1:40:04] <%JobbedBone> bosses in mirror are closer than they appear
[1:40:09] <Bennett_Fracture> man... this speedrun is not going well...
[1:40:09] <%freelancebabymaker> damn
[1:40:11] <+MisterAvry> man it would suck to get smacked with a gold bowl the size of a Volvo
[1:40:13] <%GabeSweetMan> Paige, don't target her for this Phase.
[1:40:17] <%vVAstrAVv> why paige why
[1:40:17] <LoneFonte> stunlocked NotLikeThis
[1:40:19] <%freelancebabymaker> hey paige try and avoid the ice she throws down
[1:40:21] <Tyonidus> @MisterAvry LOL
[1:40:22] <BigYanno> see that's how it usually goes
[1:40:23] <poisin224> he big
[1:40:23] <%KeiganOfAstora> This is good. Get the first phase done quickly so you have all your estus for Phase 2 and 3
[1:40:24] <+megaman_sentinel> where did he get a lord vessel from
[1:40:25] <+epinefrain> when's pat getting his vtuber?
[1:40:26] <%GabeSweetMan> That bowl slam has MASSIVE range.
[1:40:27] <%Lion_kun> Paige, target the bug boy
[1:40:29] <Tahzani> The dad is an awkward interesting design I really like
[1:40:30] <TurtlesAndTentacles> Yeah why is it scary?
[1:40:30] <danknugglit> Ice is bad to step on
[1:40:33] <%Lion_kun> big*
[1:40:34] <fluffy_sauce> you should go fight livid pyromancer dunnel
[1:40:36] <benjiFG> what
[1:40:37] <fruit_pie_the_magician> because he big and bowl mush you
[1:40:39] <EMP_Ike_Turner> mah flail
[1:40:39] <%patriotrenegade> @PeachSaliva remember to conserve your estus for round 3
[1:40:40] <%Lion_kun> He was too far.
[1:40:41] <%GabeSweetMan> Give it a few more shots.
[1:40:41] <%freelancebabymaker> avoid ice
[1:40:41] <TurtlesAndTentacles> You've killed everyone!
[1:40:43] <+JustToWatch> Paige instinctively targets the woman to kill
[1:40:43] <Tyonidus> just push a direction on the RIGHT stick that you want to switch lock to
[1:40:45] <+Archphronimos> could ember up
[1:40:45] <JacklongKondur> you got this tiger, or fox?
[1:40:45] <peachy996> Phase 1 you can handle, it's phase 2 you're going to have learn so you can have more estus for PHase 3
[1:40:46] <%Velociraptor_Cleftes> want to ember?
[1:40:50] <+MooseIsGoose> He only comes in phase 2 and 3
[1:40:50] <@PatStaresAt> Wait holy sahit you can summon him WITHOUT ember?
[1:40:52] <@PatStaresAt> Oh man they know
[1:40:53] <+transporterthesequel> Get outta phase 1 with about 12, get out of phase 2 with 7, and you should be cash(Estus charge wise)
[1:40:58] <Jaysky> Gael is a cool guy
[1:40:58] <BigYanno> If Pat got a vtuber avatar would it fit on screen or would paige have to tilt the camera down?
[1:41:09] <%GabeSweetMan> Paige STAMINA
[1:41:11] <%Monkeyweed21> @PatStaresAt it makes the end of Ringed City all the sweeter
[1:41:15] <%WhereIsWill> just tank it out! LUL
[1:41:18] <benjiFG> yeah stay alive
[1:41:28] <%freelancebabymaker> @PatStaresAt yeah its like your bloodstain showing up outside of the nameless boss room lol
[1:41:28] <Jaysky> @patstaresat He wants IN on this burning
[1:41:28] <poisin224> die in phase 1 for a laugh
[1:41:34] <$Sphincter_Spelunker> @BigYanno Pat's avatar would peek over the bottom of the screen like the neighbor in Home Improvement
[1:41:57] <%freelancebabymaker> damn
[1:41:58] <infinityk11> JEEEEZ
[1:41:58] <poisin224> LUL
[1:41:59] <%WhereIsWill> got droppec
[1:41:59] <mr_saturday93> Jesus Paige...
[1:42:00] <+Pendragwn> it would peek out of the cleavage or over the head
[1:42:03] <Treasure_Vault> Directly behind you! Don't listen to the steps.
[1:42:04] <%g0atmeal> you can see where she jumps when she starts to turn invis
[1:42:07] <danknugglit> Camst
[1:42:07] <+Rofiarf> stand against a well maybe?
[1:42:08] <EMP_Ike_Turner> Get gripped
[1:42:09] <TurtlesAndTentacles> Shes always directly behind you
[1:42:11] <%GabeSweetMan> She's always right behind you.
[1:42:11] <%freelancebabymaker> fuck the listening you rolling was working out fine
[1:42:13] <%peyodogo> yeah, do what works for you
[1:42:16] <%vVAstrAVv> dont roll directly away from her please
[1:42:17] <+Bigchill___> Just turn around and turn your camera, youll see her land
[1:42:17] <%falineth> I seem to remember you can see where she lands
[1:42:20] <$bowmaniarules> You can do it! Big and strong!
[1:42:21] <fruit_pie_the_magician> You can just go in the direction she jumps, the snow tells you
[1:42:24] <infinityk11> This is intense
[1:42:24] <+transporterthesequel> she lets out a little puff when she lands too, and breaks stuff.
[1:42:24] <Treasure_Vault> Directly behind you means directly behind you.
[1:42:25] <+Pendragwn> just do it perfect paige
[1:42:35] <%doomunderthestairs> fucking love that animation it's so fucking cool
[1:42:38] <markdreizehn> Paige you should just play the way you played the first time since you did best following your oown instincts
[1:42:41] <pi_in_the_sci> You seem to be ignoring audio cues, listen for slashes to learn dodge timeing
[1:42:52] <EMP_Ike_Turner> Friede the Invisiblessed
[1:42:54] <%GabeSweetMan> You saw where she landed Paige!
[1:42:56] <+MisterAvry> wha...
[1:42:58] <danknugglit> How
[1:42:59] <%JenovasPuppet> She can't hear what she can't see
[1:43:01] <peachy996> just roll and smash
[1:43:02] <+MisterAvry> you saw where she landed!@
[1:43:07] <%doomunderthestairs> yeah you see a poof of dust where she lands
[1:43:07] <%GabeSweetMan> Her going invisible doesn't mean she stops existing.
[1:43:08] <%vVAstrAVv> YOU SAW WHERE SHE WENT PAIGE
[1:43:11] <infinityk11> smash and roll
[1:43:14] <+QueequegTheater> Friede is probably my most hated boss fight in the series, because it feels both overtuned and uninspired.  It's just Priscilla + O&S + Lady Maria.  She even uses some of Maria's animations
[1:43:15] <peachy996> discard strats, embrace unga and/or bunga
[1:43:17] <%Monkeyweed21> stamina
[1:43:23] <+transporterthesequel> Fun fact, Friede's one of the few one on one fights in the series that doesn't really have alot of poise.
[1:43:24] <%GabeSweetMan> Object permanence is hard for the Peach.
[1:43:24] <mr_saturday93> fuck that move
[1:43:30] <%JenovasPuppet> BAITED
[1:43:30] <+TMulharin> D:

[1:43:35] <mr_saturday93> woah hard C
[1:43:35] <pabloelenano2> D:
[1:43:36] <HyperionXV> The frost cloud of the mace is making the landing snow cloud a bit hidden
[1:43:36] <poisin224> D:
[1:43:36] <+MisterAvry> behind
[1:43:37] <+QueequegTheater> Paige, you bunga'ed before unga
[1:43:38] <%GabeSweetMan> ALWAYS BEHIND PAIGE
[1:43:41] <%vVAstrAVv> WHEN YOU SEE WHERE SHE WENT DO THE THING
[1:43:42] <pi_in_the_sci> learn when to stop swinging
[1:43:43] <%g0atmeal> watch the ground for a snow poof where she lands
[1:43:45] <%GabeSweetMan> ALWAYS BEHIND
[1:43:45] <Bennett_Fracture> never give up... trust your instincts...
[1:43:45] <Treasure_Vault> Stop listening, please
[1:43:46] <+Axellogic> Cause you arent doing it
[1:43:47] <acridpaladin> paige you gotta move the camera...
[1:43:48] <BigYanno> Chat try to remember how STRESSFUL this fight was the first time you did it
[1:43:50] <SulfurousAcid> paige directly behind you
[1:43:50] <$bowmaniarules> Big and strong! Big and strong!
[1:43:50] <%Fooguwu> @PeachSaliva when she jumps, she leaves a trail of snow in the direction she jumps. when you get close, you can see her
[1:43:53] <mr_saturday93> Check your behind Paige
[1:43:54] <%JenovasPuppet> Return from whem'st thou came
[1:43:54] <+MooseIsGoose> thats because you never went behind
[1:43:56] <Treasure_Vault> I don't know why Pat lead with the footsteps tip, it's not good
[1:43:59] <+Axellogic> You arent tho
[1:43:59] <%GabeSweetMan> But you NEVER took it LMAO
[1:44:01] <TheRealGreaterGamer> Paige is playing with apple ear buds guys give her a break
[1:44:03] <%Lion_kun> Paige, your atrocious camera work is killing you
[1:44:05] <danknugglit> Youre not ho LUL
[1:44:10] <+Pendragwn> just do exactly what I did it only took me 37 attempts
[1:44:10] <%freelancebabymaker> you rolling during your first try was fine just do that
[1:44:11] <%GabeSweetMan> You never rotate the camera though!

[1:47:13] <Tyonidus> Paige I could be wrong but I think you're confused about how to switch your lock on. You just have to push the right stick to the left or to the right depending on which way the other enemy you want to switch it to is. Could be wrong though maybe it's being stupid.
[1:47:14] <%vVAstrAVv> theres maybe 10% skill

[1:51:56] <TheStrongBanana> does it count as looming if you are at eye level with him while sitting?
[1:51:57] <blue8moon> thank's pixel
[1:51:59] <@commanderclaw> That's a magic ass pixel
[1:52:01] <Admiral_PopnFresh> @JobbedBone man I loom so hard you don't even know
[1:52:02] <Jaysky> jermaChomp
[1:52:04] <%dankjerri> The Orb doth loom like the sun over an unforgiving world
[1:52:06] <%WhereIsWill> AMAZING
[1:52:06] <peachy996> That wasn't even 1 HP that was 0.1
[1:52:08] <$bowmaniarules> Wowzers in yo trousers
[1:52:09] <Faustgesicht> Backhand the healer
[1:52:12] <SivSarcast> No-lock hit? Nice
[1:52:16] <%Puhff> hit him in the ASS
[1:52:17] <+MooseIsGoose> Is cause she is woman
[1:52:20] <+MisterAvry> he's the size of a house
[1:52:20] <BigYanno> BTW if you need a breather for a second you can backstab her
[1:52:23] <+QueequegTheater> Paige did you just swing at air three times for literally no reason
[1:52:23] <+MisterAvry> and slow
[1:52:24] <peachy996> Plus she staggers
[1:52:24] <%JobbedBone> depth perception LUL
[1:52:31] <benjiFG> two hand your mace
[1:52:34] <%Puhff> hey you got a hit in
[1:52:35] <Admiral_PopnFresh> god already 50 percent on this face
[1:52:38] <%vVAstrAVv> you can get him if youre not across the room
[1:52:43] <mr_saturday93> Sandwich!
[1:52:44] <TheRealGreaterGamer> CHAIRED
[1:52:46] <BigYanno> Weirdly he's easier to hit with fast weapons and she's easier with big ones
[1:52:46] <Admiral_PopnFresh> at least DPS is good
[1:52:48] <Jaysky> No Paige you're ash
[1:52:50] <%GabeSweetMan> I think I figured it out. Paige is so incredibly good at dodging "on reaction" because she's intending to dodge half a second earlier, but because the game is intentionally trying to throw off your timing with delayed attacks, Paige's delayed reaction speed syncs up with most bosses.
[1:52:51] <peachy996> And she is used to Friede swinging more than crow man
[1:52:54] <danknugglit> Good attempt
[1:52:54] <@commanderclaw> You went one handed there for a bit, might want to change back to two handed
[1:53:00] <$Sphincter_Spelunker> @PeachSaliva The big guy always attacks in a straight line when he's far away
[1:53:04] <rosemon5001> wow she really cant control her whamen murder boner KEKW
[1:53:07] <NiftyNox> strimmer y are u not perfect like me???? qnger
[1:53:10] <TheRealGreaterGamer> @GabeSweetMan BIG BRAIN
[1:53:16] <%dankjerri> HypeBeard HypeBeard HypeBeard
[1:53:19] <+transporterthesequel> Paige I'm going to give you the best advice. Don't listen to anyone. Just stop thinking. FULL HEAD EMPTY MUST SWING
[1:53:24] <%AncelDeLambert> alright, everybody, raise your arms and give Paige your energy
[1:53:26] <%peyodogo> love how the boss is just like "you already fucked everything up on your side of things, leave us alone here at least"
[1:53:32] <%JoshManVGH> So is this like the Princes fight, where she's gotta down them both at the same time to win?
[1:53:38] <Admiral_PopnFresh> good damage
[1:53:39] <shotgang86> So paige is doing that thing in Baki where they are just "let your body fight don't think"
[1:53:41] <+MisterAvry> how!
[1:53:42] <BigYanno> I'd Unga Sister Friede's Bunga any day
[1:53:42] <%peyodogo> @transporterthesequel yeah this is prob the best advice for real
[1:53:45] <%AncelDeLambert> @peyodogo the problem is "here" is pretty fucked up too
[1:53:46] <+MooseIsGoose> You saw where she landed
[1:53:46] <AMajorTom> jaboodyEnergy jaboodyEnergy
[1:53:46] <+WRATHZOG> Ah she saw that one
[1:53:47] <benjiFG> PAIGE
[1:53:47] <mr_saturday93> Always behind Paige.
[1:53:48] <%vVAstrAVv> brute force never fails starting now
[1:53:49] <Treasure_Vault> You saw where she landed!
[1:53:49] <%Fooguwu> paige you SAW HER LAND
[1:53:49] <+transporterthesequel> Wow that's some pat level blind
[1:53:50] <TheRealGreaterGamer> EARS EARS
[1:53:53] <Admiral_PopnFresh> you did a 360 though LUL
[1:53:53] <%g0atmeal> just go hit her, you saw where she landed
[1:53:53] <%Lion_kun> YOU SAW WHERE SHE LANDED
[1:53:54] <BigYanno> YOU SAW THE POMF
[1:53:54] <@PatStaresAt> @PeachSaliva Paige you saw where she landed
[1:53:55] <pabloelenano2> you looked at her...and then started to spin the camera...
[1:53:56] <glass_marcus> You saw her
[1:54:00] <+MisterAvry> You have to GO TO WHERE SHE LANDS!
[1:54:01] <Onilink> Wow... you need to run up to her lol. YOu were locked on still.
[1:54:02] <%patriotrenegade> You SAW where she landed
[1:54:02] <Oneyeseesin3D> gotta drink that soul flavored gatoraid
[1:54:05] <@PatStaresAt> @PeachSaliva She landed directly in front of you and went invisible
[1:54:05] <peachy996> just roll like a nut when she does that
[1:54:05] <Bennett_Fracture> cant win em all eh...
[1:54:08] <Coystick> I can't believe Pat would sabotage your success like this.
[1:54:08] <%JobbedBone> its the advice's fault Kappa
[1:54:09] <%AncelDeLambert> UNGA. BUNGA.
[1:54:10] <%GabeSweetMan> YUP!
[1:54:10] <Profmcstevie> Honestly, when she goes invisible just stand still and roll when you see her, she has a big wind up
[1:54:11] <mr_saturday93> Full ultra instinct
[1:54:12] <danknugglit> UNGA
[1:54:12] <%Lion_kun> WHY DIDN'T YOU GO TO THE SPOT AND ATTACK HER
[1:54:14] <%AncelDeLambert> UNGA BUNGA!
[1:54:14] <shotgang86> JUST UNGA
[1:54:15] <Oneyeseesin3D> Time for Brute smarts

[1:54:16] <%GabeSweetMan> UNGA BUNGA ULTRA INSTINCT
[1:54:16] <@commanderclaw> No thoughts, only hammer
[1:54:17] <%vVAstrAVv> youre like doing it wrong then saying it dont help
[1:54:19] <%graemecrackers2> Swing harder
[1:54:20] <%Puhff> it did not
[1:54:20] <%Fooguwu> run up to where she lands and HIT HER PAIGE
[1:54:21] <+Undenizen> Paige, your top is slipping down.
[1:54:24] <+QueequegTheater> JUST USE 6H Kappa
[1:54:24] <ryderbootz> i am shaking my fist at the screen like an 80 year old
[1:54:24] <BigYanno> That's where she landed so THAT'S WHERE SHE IS
[1:54:25] <DancesWitBalrog> UNGA BUNGA
[1:54:25] <%Velociraptor_Cleftes> Activate ULTRA INSTINCT
[1:54:25] <Piemono> Yeah just return to MONKE
[1:54:26] <%geekjacob> ember up might help a bit more
[1:54:27] <WillofGame> What do you y'all think estus tastes like?
[1:54:28] <+ThomasOfTroy> Emote mode?
[1:54:28] <benjiFG> i'm so upset
[1:54:28] <%Sotetsu> Mute the chaaaaaat
[1:54:29] <+FiresideInternetCafe> IT DOESN'T MATTER IF SHE 'SAW' HER OR NOT. She has said multiple times she's just going to play her way and she doesn't want the advice.
[1:54:29] <+JustToWatch> just close your eyes and swing
[1:54:29] <%patriotrenegade> Then run over and hit her
[1:54:29] <Treasure_Vault> When she lands, unga ?
[1:54:30] <Dunmarkh> just activate your gamer powers
[1:54:30] <Onilink> You need to run up to her to make her turn visible lol.
[1:54:31] <+MisterAvry> Seeing her land doesn't do shit if you just run in a fucking circle instead of going to attack
[1:54:32] <Ethel9727> Paige, I believe in you <3
[1:54:33] <mr_saturday93> Paige you asked for this
[1:54:34] <$Sphincter_Spelunker> welcome to dark souls
[1:54:34] <JayCantDo> Wall
[1:54:35] <%Puhff> you always sucked :)
[1:54:35] <%dankjerri> chaaaatuh
[1:54:36] <TheStrongBanana> you are doing fucking great
[1:54:36] <%Lion_kun> She turns visible if you go close to her.
[1:54:36] <Admiral_PopnFresh> octoSad
[1:54:37] <+transporterthesequel> Look, literally ALL OF US have been here with her.
[1:54:38] <%MarylandJutsu> Guys dont be rude
[1:54:39] <$Quack_of_Dawn> @WillofGame everclear
[1:54:39] <+Axellogic> Did you know that she has a scythe?
[1:54:40] <lotharrio> Unga... bunga?
[1:54:41] <TurtlesAndTentacles> Paige you will always see where she lands if you directly behind yourself. Youre doing fine.
[1:54:43] <maxpasta> ur doing great
[1:54:43] <Valdorick> This fight sucks.
[1:54:43] <danknugglit> Youre doing great though
[1:54:45] <mr_saturday93> LUL
[1:54:47] <%ElkRiverDog> Emote only?
[1:54:47] <%vVAstrAVv> oh noone thought youd get THIS fight done dw lol
[1:54:49] <TurtlesAndTentacles> You didnt run toward her
[1:54:50] <%Puhff> hehehehehe
[1:54:50] <shotgang86> hmmmm
[1:54:51] <mr_saturday93> Ha oral
[1:54:55] <+Archphronimos> you can do it. you've shown that you can
[1:54:56] <+MooseIsGoose> Paige just imagine they both woman you will win
[1:54:56] <Valdorick> HEY-OH
[1:54:56] <Dunmarkh> the full package
[1:54:56] <CandyCoatedConfection> LUL
[1:54:56] <%sandrews> sometimes Unga Bunga is the best brain strat
[1:54:57] <%KeiganOfAstora> Oral is not allowed
[1:55:00] <%dankjerri> just shove that mace in their assholes like you always do
[1:55:00] <+QueequegTheater> @PeachSaliva @PatStaresAt If only she had completed the DS2 DLCs she would have the secret knowledge of how to beat this fight easy Kappa
[1:55:12] <+FiresideInternetCafe> I feel like her lunge is somewhat inconsistent but maybe I'm nuts.
[1:55:13] <shotgang86> to be honest that is one nasty grab
[1:55:17] <TheRealGreaterGamer> Maybe the next time she does that attack running in a circle will work
[1:55:18] <%Puhff> i love when you swing at nothing
[1:55:27] <TurtlesAndTentacles> LMAO Paige youre super lady
[1:55:27] <Onilink> You need to run up to her to make her turn visible lol. You are doing well on the direction but you just stand there.
[1:55:29] <SivSarcast> Also Paige, if you throw knives at her, those will be visible.
[1:55:33] <clumsydemiurge> is this the vtuber that beat pinwheel first try
[1:55:33] <%Fooguwu> Paige doesn't understand that if she knows where she lands, she can run up and hit her
[1:55:34] <%GabeSweetMan> LUL
[1:55:35] <benjiFG> the pomf
[1:55:35] <+RD_NX> I never beat sissy friede
[1:55:35] <%dankjerri> drankeded
[1:55:37] <mr_saturday93> I noticed that she dodges in a straight line instead of to the side
[1:55:39] <%GabeSweetMan> Sip sip takes priority
[1:55:39] <Admiral_PopnFresh> I'm drinking right now!
[1:55:40] <+FiresideInternetCafe> You can unga her but you have to do it with more health.
[1:55:40] <augusta_wind> you got this!!
[1:55:42] <Mrbaconator> pizzaed when you shoulda french fried
[1:55:42] <%Puhff> tuuuunnel viiiision
[1:55:42] <+JustToWatch> just tech the throw
[1:55:45] <%patriotrenegade> well, I guess she'll figure it out herself.
[1:55:46] <+QueequegTheater> So is the full Skyrim LP next Kappa
[1:55:46] <danknugglit> You can do it :)
[1:55:46] <%Agami23> paige, get a fly swatter and slap her ass with it like the big lady from resident evil

[1:55:59] <+McSoliace> chat has become the enemy
[1:56:00] <haydenthygreat> this fight is a pain in the booty
[1:56:03] <%vVAstrAVv> pat tell how how to not walk in a circle
[1:56:04] <+MisterAvry> You're doing amazing except for that one thing
[1:56:04] <$bowmaniarules> Not with that attitude!
[1:56:05] <+FiresideInternetCafe> This isn't a one day boss lol I wouldn't blame you.l
[1:56:06] <BigYanno> UNGA!
[1:56:07] <BigYanno> BUNGA!
[1:56:08] <%Joller2> if you roll towards her when she reappears it might give you a better shot of dodging that move
[1:56:08] <%peyodogo> its a fun fight though
[1:56:10] <Admiral_PopnFresh> you are strong, probably in a better situation then when i try this boss solo
[1:56:10] <%dankjerri> hit those fuckers
[1:56:11] <%KeiganOfAstora> Summon help
[1:56:13] <+MooseIsGoose> Believe in the you that we believe in
[1:56:14] <%KeiganOfAstora> Try it with help one time
[1:56:15] <EMP_Ike_Turner> This is a real-ass fight, don’t sweat it
[1:56:15] <%doomunderthestairs> I believe in the unga bunga
[1:56:15] <shotgang86> Unga her Bunga
[1:56:16] <+transporterthesequel> Look it's fine, literally the way we all learned phase one is COPIUS amounts of deaths to that grab. You eventually just feel it.
[1:56:23] <$bowmaniarules> Well that's different!
[1:56:26] <%KeiganOfAstora> @PeachSaliva Try it with Gael this time
[1:56:27] <%Puhff> SUN IS DOWN
[1:56:27] <+MisterAvry> low bar for ornery
[1:56:27] <mr_saturday93> And horny
[1:56:27] <%Velociraptor_Cleftes> you're actually doing great with tracking the jump! if you're able to run toward her, she'll reappear and you don't have to spam roll
[1:56:28] <%dankjerri> have a cracker
[1:56:29] <%GabeSweetMan> You made INCREDIBLE progress tonight tbh.
[1:56:29] <$hrbeck_> it rhyme
[1:56:30] <TheRealGreaterGamer> Paige is using bluetooth wii speakers go easy on her
[1:56:31] <%peyodogo> like as long as you're having fun it should go decent
[1:56:32] <Prism_Wing> No, Anri died.
[1:56:32] <peachy996> No worries if you don't.

[1:56:52] <AMajorTom> She's right behind me? Imma turn 360 degrees and walk away.
[1:56:53] <mr_saturday93> I'd say I'm Horngry
[1:56:54] <%dankjerri> ennui
[1:56:56] <@commanderclaw> I often do way better with a Souls boss after coming back the next day for some reason. Don't push yourself and make it unfun for yourself
[1:57:00] <BigYanno> Honestly doing phase 1 without backstabbing her to death is never fun
[1:57:02] <danknugglit> Good dodge
