[0:21:46] <YakumoYomi> Youtube's sound library has some good music
[0:21:46] <Djinnazz> That's not the same team
[0:21:46] <%Gogogolem> Gogogolem subscribed with Prime. They've subscribed for 45 months!
[0:21:47] <+nazzynoeyes> Deus Ex is dead and I am so fucking upset about it. I just want Adam Jensen back :(
[0:21:47] <%TooManyGs> Hard Pass
[0:21:47] <+Frost_Quill> He sexed that tentacle.

[0:22:06] <justcallmebobplease> 'Fresh', huh
[0:22:07] <+ringabal> That's what I'm talking about!
[0:22:07] <$Varlinator> Might be good.... if it doesn't have ANY microtransactions
[0:22:07] <goose_coward> FRENCH take
[0:22:07] <+Vampireinarm> single player Pog
[0:22:08] <Spiralpower1620> ok I down for that
[0:22:08] <+michingmallecho> Single player okay
[0:22:08] <Sotetsu> For the past few years, we've been making terrible 3rd party licensed games.
[0:22:09] <cardamomo88> french so french
[0:22:09] <coreyyotto> as long as it's not a GaaS it should be okay
[0:22:09] <MelonsArePeopleToo> wish I had a sexy tentacle :(
[0:22:10] <SomeAsianDood> have you heard la hee?
[0:22:10] <AlphaRayAllen> SUPER DMCA
[0:22:11] <+gwanzan> awesome, no Game as a service bullshit
[0:22:12] <+DorianCreed> C'est francais
[0:22:15] <%Nitsorinni> REally makes you FEEL like Peter
[0:22:15] <@PlagueOfGripes> square-enix's latest batch of published games leaves a little to be desired
[0:22:16] <clumsydemiurge> totally not based on the mcu versions
[0:22:17] <+shouttothevoid> wow very unique
[0:22:17] <bigfastkaratedealership> OH SO THIS GARBAGE IS WHY WE ARENT GETING MORE DEUS EX?!?
[0:22:20] <Raikouija> Games as a service needs to die
[0:22:21] <KishinGrek> this looks better than avengers
[0:22:21] <X2Eliah> At least it's not bloody multiplayer
[0:22:23] <+The_Protagonist> that'd get DMCA'd like crazy yeah
[0:22:23] <freelancebabymaker> god as long as its not the avengers
[0:22:24] <Devbob98> Cool art
[0:22:25] <KeiPrime> our take on the guardians, but the roster is from the movie
[0:22:25] <+Ixiah> Plague join the stream !
[0:22:25] <%legendfather_of_giants> I Need a Hero getting a lot of play lately @PeachSaliva
[0:22:26] <+crocodile_t34rz> In fact, exactly the opposite of Avengers
[0:22:26] <%takotoots> yeyeyeye
[0:22:28] <TurtlesAndTentacles> I bought avengers. Im waiting on this bullshit
[0:22:29] <+michingmallecho> Deus Ex is dead BibleThump
[0:22:31] <+IveGotALaserFace> this actually looks pretty cool
[0:22:31] <+senfood> DAN ABNETT YES
[0:22:32] <+Captainahab_37> I hope the story is 3 hours then it's a destiny clone
[0:22:32] <Profmcstevie> Only a little to be desired...just a liitttle
[0:22:33] <stabbityrabbit> Our own fresh take. The copy pasted story-focused-AAA formula.
[0:22:34] <%dankjerri> when I think fresh game i dont think 3rd person action adventure
[0:22:34] <theanora1> you think they're doing it separate from Avengers cause that game bombed so hard?
[0:22:34] <%Ranryu692> where are Moondragon and Phyla Vell, though?
[0:22:34] <laguerrilha> Groot looks kind of stiff, like a tree
[0:22:35] <Diablo169> Oh thats a big fucking deal.
[0:22:37] <terrantom1990> oh shit Dan!!
[0:22:37] <+ThatGuyThunder> Hopefully it‚Äôs better than Avengers. Give it more time to develop than not at all.
[0:22:38] <+Sir_Gawain_Lotsson> DOG
[0:22:38] <lotharrio> Yeah! DAN ABNETT!
[0:22:39] <+clockworkblues> big boy
[0:22:40] <moonmintparadise> OF COURSE DAN ABNETT WROTE IT
[0:22:41] <+gwanzan> Abnett's GotG is fucking amazing
[0:22:42] <balthazar758> what a shame
[0:22:42] <iosephe> Wait Dan Abnett!?
[0:22:42] <Toni_Master43> God, comic Starlord looks way cooler
[0:22:43] <+RealThiele> gameplay?
[0:22:43] <+IveGotALaserFace> holy shit its Dan!
[0:22:44] <+gaomachine> Holy crap Dan Abnett!
[0:22:44] <antimatter_man> Wait it was need a hero?
[0:22:45] <josstil> space dog looks cool
[0:22:46] <+Imperial_Madman> DAN MY BOI
[0:22:46] <stabbityrabbit> DAN ABNETT GAME GOOD NOW
[0:22:50] <buerdo> I don‚Äôt like starlord‚Äôs haircut
[0:22:52] <+Eureka_seveN77> Warhammer man!
[0:22:53] <DeadEyeArrow> Dan Abnett is a good writer
[0:22:53] <Prevot> why the fuck would they only make starlord playable
[0:22:53] <lotharrio> Now bring in Andy Landing!
[0:22:54] <%dankjerri> boooo Dan abnett
[0:22:54] <VentWilsn> LITERALLY JUST SAY IF THE LOOT SYSTEM WILL BE FIXED
[0:22:55] <+Frost_Quill> I like Guardians of the Galaxy, so I'll give this a chance.
[0:22:56] <drag0nbl00ded> let them make Deus Ex square you COWARDS!
[0:22:56] <antimatter_man> Didnt they JUST use that song for He Man
[0:22:57] <%Jjrossman> ok Dan Abnett is based
[0:22:57] <joliorn> yaaaay abnett
[0:22:58] <KineticZen> Actual writer alongside "VP" parasite
[0:23:05] <BlueBiscuitGT> Yeah but this are definitely based on the MCU version, although even the comics ended up imitating the movie version
[0:23:07] <%takotoots> @antimatter_man yea
[0:23:09] <%ajvstheworld> As much as I hope this succeeds, this holds zero interest from me.
[0:23:09] <+Prism_Zet> where's starlords dumb space scooter gun
[0:23:09] <+regularjimmy88> Fresh take? They have the characterisation of the MCU version. There's nothing original here.
[0:23:10] <josstil> furry crush
[0:23:13] <+tsubakiparadox> fricken goatee braids lol
[0:23:14] <+Ixiah> and they asked WHERE ARE THE MINIBUYS ???
[0:23:15] <Mangahero18> I feel bad for the developers for this game because even if this game is GOOD its going to get flak for not having the more mainstream likenesses of the movie character counterparts. The game characters here are obviously based off of the Comic versions.
[0:23:15] <Pnutz409> that name is so montreal
[0:23:16] <$Niney_Who> Listen just don't make it a Dogshit Looter game like Avengers
[0:23:16] <BlueBiscuitGT> Quill used to be so different
[0:23:20] <Chaos_Aether> I am groot
[0:23:21] <karovus> is that kratos
[0:23:23] <+clockworkblues> pupppy
[0:23:23] <$Niney_Who> Make it a character action
[0:23:25] <%Keyd00d> whateveruh
[0:23:27] <$Solidnick18> drax loks okay
[0:23:27] <%Ranryu692> GIVE DRAX HIS SAX
[0:23:29] <Diablo169> Ok this has gone on too long now.
[0:23:30] <guiltyboya> It looks interesting. As long as it's not a game-as-service garbage, I'm interested
[0:23:32] <%Starotter70> psaDogchamp
[0:23:33] <+ThatAbridger> Is this the Avengers game or separate?
[0:23:33] <+Ixiah> choese foot
[0:23:34] <+FlubbedPig> This feels more interesting right off the bat than Avengers, honestly.
[0:23:34] <+Frost_Quill> Drax is too small.
[0:23:36] <Zeif00> Gief wants all that CHEESE
[0:23:37] <+crocodile_t34rz> Quill used to be kinda straight laced before mcu
[0:23:37] <Devbob98> Mary poppins is best guardian
[0:23:37] <Spiralpower1620> MCU GOTG >> Comics GOTG
[0:23:38] <ShinMaddrox> It's a new game.  but it's clearly running on the Marvel Avengers engine.
[0:23:38] <Louie_Salmon> If this somehow turns out to be a live service game it may as well not exist
[0:23:39] <Raikouija> Deus ex died for this shit
[0:23:40] <+ratreborn> this isn't the Avengers team, this is the Deus Ex team, maybe it will be decent
[0:23:41] <%ajvstheworld> I think I‚Äôm just too jaded on super hero shit.
[0:23:41] <+TheotherKristian> What are the odds this plays like avengers?
[0:23:42] <BlueBiscuitGT> Those look like Destiny enemies
[0:23:48] <AlphaRayAllen> Okay
[0:23:48] <%walternatorz> sell rocket
[0:23:50] <J_Walter_Weatherman> LITERALLY

[0:24:07] <+tsubakiparadox> WALKMAN YEEAAAAH
[0:24:10] <+JusTTheGuyYouNeed> At least this time the characters dont look like discount Mcu avengers
[0:24:13] <Louie_Salmon> Alright this is a little much
[0:24:13] <Jrocy247> Next game
[0:24:13] <ConorIsOnTwitchNow> the boots are cool
[0:24:13] <Sotetsu> @plagueofgripes Ouph
[0:24:15] <VentWilsn> BUT I WANT ROCKET
[0:24:15] <%Nitsorinni> Who cares?
[0:24:16] <+DGenerator> Susan Sarandon is running the narrative?
[0:24:17] <cardamomo88> literally
[0:24:17] <+Speed1ines> You really are playing a game
[0:24:17] <+Shishi1205> yeah
[0:24:18] <laguerrilha> yeah
[0:24:18] <+Ne1son> Wrong
[0:24:19] <+RealThiele> ayyy gameplay
[0:24:19] <Tracazoid> Discount Warframe man
[0:24:20] <Darren716> Oh I just realized, this game is gonna be a DMCA nightmare
[0:24:20] <Diablo169> It's fucking boring.
[0:24:21] <%dankjerri> done with this already
[0:24:21] <HitchhikingThrough> Oh this game is going to be IMPOSSIBLE to stream
[0:24:21] <+Wulfphelz> I actually like the design of these characters compared to the Avengers design
[0:24:21] <+dedeec> oH DO YOU only PLAY AS STARLORD?
[0:24:23] <%ajvstheworld> Agree.
[0:24:23] <Daxalog> !nextgame
[0:24:24] <nehaerys> ResidentSleeper ResidentSleeper ResidentSleeper
[0:24:27] <+dedeec> oh i fucked the caps up
[0:24:28] <TheYellowcouch> that's real weak
[0:24:29] <+Talimity> it really makes you FEEL like a guardian
[0:24:29] <TurtlesAndTentacles> I like being Star Lord.
[0:24:29] <formuoli8> sygorne?
[0:24:31] <%Keyd00d> we saw all this
[0:24:31] <KineticZen> It looks really floaty and without impact so far
[0:24:31] <%ajvstheworld> You should be able to play all of em.
[0:24:32] <cheerfulnpc> The more time they spend on one game, the more obvious it is that they don't have a lot to show
[0:24:33] <lotharrio> If you could play as all of them, you'd never play as Starlord.
[0:24:33] <+angelnickl> You can't play fun characters.
[0:24:35] <AnneSQF> we just saw all these clips.....
[0:24:35] <+FlubbedPig> Eh, his tools work the best for gameplay
[0:24:35] <%Ranryu692> Star Lord is the most interesting if they actually utilise his Element Guns
[0:24:35] <ape_hawk> OH MY GOD, NEXT
[0:24:35] <MemMoor> it's not mass effect if you don't play as a boring human
[0:24:36] <cardamomo88> let me by a rocket
[0:24:37] <Spiralpower1620> Steve Blum as Star-Lord?
[0:24:37] <amiavamp> It's like Mass Effect, what do you mean you don't want to play as the boring human lol
[0:24:38] <Chaossheep> wow that joke almost got funnier the second time
[0:24:38] <%takotoots> ff7 party combat would be cool
[0:24:38] <+boomstarprime> is this mass effect?
[0:24:41] <josstil> about 5 years too late
[0:24:41] <Louie_Salmon> Just saying words huh
[0:24:41] <GinoDacampo> budget chris pratt
[0:24:41] <Diablo169> We saw the film, you don't need to tell us this shit jesus

[0:24:48] <%ajvstheworld> Why the most boring one of the entire group?
[0:24:49] <+Morgluxia> ResidentSleeper
[0:24:51] <Dementedpenguin> What's the point then?

[0:24:57] <goose_coward> how's everyone's day going
[0:24:59] <%TooManyGs> Bad track record for Marvel games, definitely passing on it
[0:24:59] <coreyyotto> Why does Drax look like Kratos
[0:25:01] <KeiPrime> all the footage was already shwon in the trailer
[0:25:02] <SomeAsianDood> it's just marvel rehash ResidentSleeper
[0:25:03] <Pnutz409> isn't starlord the blank slate hero?
[0:25:03] <Dfreddy8> FILLER
[0:25:03] <nomolomo> would rather play as gamora to shoot and fight with a sword, honestly. sounds more interesting

[0:28:03] <FirstFireKeeper> ResidentSleeper ResidentSleeper LUL Great banter

[0:28:25] <%TomAtlus> Kill me
[0:28:25] <BlueBiscuitGT> You would need more charismatic voice actors to make this work
[0:28:26] <+gwanzan> at least this isn't Avengers crap

[0:33:58] <laguerrilha> Please end here
[0:33:59] <+OneGorillionDollars> Theres no point in making marvel games if 80% of your budget has to go towards paying rights
[0:33:59] <+FlubbedPig> I REALLY don't like Peter's voice
[0:33:59] <Pnutz409> can you drive to the studio and say wtf?

[0:34:06] <+shaidot> Just let Insomniac do all the superhero games going forward
[0:34:07] <+NateyBeak> I cant beleive that the more they show of this the worse it gets
[0:34:08] <+megaman_sentinel> are those Legos
[0:34:08] <%half_awake1> Zangief is best part of presentation
[0:34:10] <GearVoltron> Next bit
[0:34:10] <+psidefx> I never noticed the style meter until the end

[0:35:09] <+brosesarered> why are you saying choices don't matter? he chose to change his mind
[0:35:09] <TurtlesAndTentacles> Paige likes short assholes. Its on brand

[0:35:21] <+michingmallecho> the graphics and fur on rocket looks nice

[0:46:20] <+Movemeister> mobile game LUL
[0:46:20] <Zeikier> inb4 Platinum sent to the CoD Mines

[0:46:22] <+OmegaWeltall> this looks EARLY.... VERY EARLY
[0:46:23] <+Prism_Zet> this looks like "white knight" chronicles
[0:46:23] <KuroStardust> Platinum has made some bad games
[0:46:23] <bob900000> this is really weird
[0:46:24] <SomeAsianDood> 4 player coop???
[0:46:24] <+king_of_beggars> This feels really shitty in my eyeballs.
[0:46:24] <+BallinArbiter> Come on platinum what is this?
[0:46:24] <RoldanDgr8> where's the style?
[0:46:24] <%Ranryu692> isn't it a mobile game?
[0:46:24] <+Aceofstaves> ITS SO STIFF
[0:46:25] <8BitDsx> very stiff looking
[0:46:25] <+lethallunacyx> Also looks generic and boring
[0:46:25] <aqua_mashu> platinum has lost its luster
[0:46:25] <Valdorick> Maybe it some of the people from Dragon's Dogma?
[0:46:25] <noyman2000> Almost Alfred Ashfordy
[0:46:26] <%dankjerri> this is not the A team
[0:46:26] <Broand> The enemies aren't responing to attacks
[0:46:26] <%viciousgrim> seems a bit slow
[0:46:26] <$MrDrayko> TMNT, Korra
[0:46:26] <+Captainahab_37> this looks limp yeah
[0:46:26] <$Varlinator> This can't be platinum
[0:46:26] <bigshedman> Still waiting on that 'unique artstyle'...
[0:46:26] <+Ilpala> nothing has weight, the enemies are no-selling everything

[0:46:28] <+zinris> is this phone game?
[0:46:28] <2Bs_USB_port> flaccid game
[0:46:28] <BlueBiscuitGT> Also doesn't look like the original trailer IMO
[0:46:28] <iosephe> Maybe they're trying to do a Dark Souls?
[0:46:28] <Darren716> We haven't seen one dodge
[0:46:28] <bumpoman> platinum didnt give 2 shits
[0:46:28] <+greencapps> man that artstyle looks bad
[0:46:28] <+toficque> yeah, not very Platinum
[0:46:29] <ToneBacas> Z team more like
[0:46:29] <@PlagueOfGripes> Platinum B?

[0:46:30] <DeadEyeArrow> Scalebound leftover work
[0:46:31] <%legendfather_of_giants> This looks like a Diablo-like
[0:46:31] <PunkZedB> it looks flacid
[0:46:32] <cardamomo88> no winners today only losers
[0:46:32] <+BubbaRands> this is clunky
[0:46:34] <goose_coward> Platinum is dead, long live Platinum
[0:46:34] <%Bt_Robot> That seems much slower than most Platinum games
[0:46:35] <coreyyotto> Early? Wasn't it announced over a year ago?
[0:46:35] <MelonsArePeopleToo> SEEN THROUGH THE VEIL AT LAST MEGATRON? NOW I RULE THE DECEPTICONS

[1:01:33] <J0j0nes> DARKNESS!!!
[1:01:33] <Hanbei1708> the fourth was garland
[1:01:34] <Shion963> pointlessly edgy, and also tonally dissonant in how they're dressed
[1:01:34] <%walternatorz> they already made a silly goose game, it was good
[1:01:35] <+Massimoman64> BECAUSE OF THE CHAOS
[1:01:36] <%Bt_Robot> C H A O S?
[1:01:36] <bigfastkaratedealership> psaSkelmo psaSkelmo psaSkelmo
[1:01:36] <+Frost_Quill> It was unintentionally goofy edgy.  Goofy edgy can be fun when they know the'yre doing it, but they're not.
[1:01:37] <+cappyd33> garlond is the fourth one
[1:01:37] <Grim1952> This is a japanese dub game
[1:01:37] <+crocodile_t34rz> Where was Fighter, Black Mage, Black Belt, White Mage, Red Mage, Thief?!
[1:01:37] <goose_coward> CHAOS IS THE ONLY TRUE ANSWER
[1:01:38] <+gwanzan> White Mage!
[1:01:38] <floralkami> the main characters look like jobbers
[1:01:39] <+Rusty_beartrap> Final Fantasy XV: Final Fantasy Origins
[1:01:39] <investorscratchit> You're 4
[1:01:39] <+regularjimmy88> Garland will beomce a Warrior of Light
[1:01:39] <$Puhff> it's one trailer
[1:01:40] <laexae> CHAOS
[1:01:40] <+dayz1003> they can't count
[1:01:41] <gamezerox> Engine couldn't handle it
[1:01:42] <guiltyboya> PLOT TWIST - THE FOURTH ONE IS CHAOS
[1:01:43] <+biodomewithpaulyshor> There are three characters because Destiny poisoned the well for everybody
[1:01:43] <srkAres> maybe its CHAOS
[1:01:43] <+king_of_beggars> Why aren't all 3 Monk to cheese roll the game?
[1:01:44] <+Mr_Pylon> they probably arent the actual warriors of light
[1:01:44] <shieldecho> It's a Nomura game, if you replace chaos with darkness there'd be no  difference
[1:01:45] <devanmuse> what was the name of that trailer? the edgy one? i missed it
[1:01:45] <%Nitsorinni> CHOAS is the 4th
[1:01:45] <+DakotaMacDoodle> not a good trailer.
[1:01:46] <%TooManyGs> THey really didn't need to do a showcase
[1:01:46] <Lupinzee> Who the fuck decided to let Nomura ruin Garland
[1:01:46] <Gorshum> Garland will be the 4th
[1:01:46] <komixsanz> That was basically DMC reboot but with final fantasy...
[1:01:46] <$RenegadeHatter> FINAL FANTASY USA
[1:01:48] <Kaji04> GARLAND IS THE 4th WoL
[1:01:48] <Dunmarkh> CHAOS
[1:01:48] <%takotoots> cuz their probably not no WoL
[1:01:49] <axelkaspar> WE ARE IN HELL
[1:01:49] <FunkyStreams> Chaos looks like a Nightmare from SC so its cool.
[1:01:49] <%dankjerri> absolute fuckin shit show
[1:01:49] <%Keyd00d> I can really enjoy some dumb edgy stuff but... damn
[1:01:49] <+Andrizzleton> she was the vo
[1:01:51] <%superc37> superc37 subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 49 months, currently on a 49 month streak! so does japan not have thesauruses or dictionaries or is numora's vocabulary jjust that small
[1:01:51] <+TunakIn> that was a nomura game gosh darb

[1:01:55] <nomolomo> so thoughts on the marvel panel?
[1:01:56] <Asgardian_Rebel> Worst E3 ever my roommate fell asleep during it
[1:01:57] <+dayz1003> that was video games.
[1:01:57] <%legendfather_of_giants> @PeachSaliva max is going to be on the Twich Gaming show
[1:01:58] <Dunmarkh> IT WAS CHAOS
[1:01:59] <kclt10> That sure was a winner

[1:02:11] <+wickedends> I'm glad I was cautiously optimistic about that FFI reimagining
[1:02:11] <CatRidder> dont be
[1:02:12] <J0j0nes> It's supposed to be four, and two of them were girls.
[1:02:12] <Enigmatic_Voidling> Plot Twist: Those assholes fail and then the ACTUAL group of FF1 Heroes show up and then don't fail
[1:02:14] <+michingmallecho> I wonder if Capcom will show SF6 or just a tease tomorrow
[1:02:14] <+LeftHandedHeather> Can someone explain why the main dude is wearing like a button up T shirt instead of armor????
[1:02:14] <%Nitsorinni> Incredibly optimistic take
[1:02:14] <+gwanzan> they certainly can't get worse
[1:02:14] <Coystick> PC gaming Show will save us
[1:02:15] <OnonokiNonon> It was more of an anti-thing, really.
[1:02:16] <$JoshManVGH> CHAOS DID THIS! WE MUST KILL CHAOS!

[1:02:22] <+darkmithrionx> No Paige, SHADE EM
[1:02:22] <bigfastkaratedealership> That was the whole stream?
[1:02:22] <+Ritei> it would be fine if they didnt spend 25 mins on marvel

[1:02:27] <Ultimatefool> C. H. A. O. S
[1:02:28] <Esparsenior> In 6 months ‚Ä¶ not a chance]
[1:02:29] <$Puhff> yeah life is strange is garbage, i wish it would die
[1:02:29] <CD_Vorporal> chaos emeralds
[1:02:30] <+TopTieramisu> EmPaThY
[1:02:32] <+Shaggnar> Just call it telepathy
[1:02:32] <+RealThiele> her power is explained badly
[1:02:32] <+Lioncock> all i want from square is a new deus ex and they dont wanna fucking make one
[1:02:33] <wohdin> Tetsuya Nomura should be publicly filleted for his crimes
[1:02:33] <+CaityCoopScoops> That was one of the streams i've ever seen
[1:02:35] <+king_of_beggars> We're not going to talk about that Platinum game looking like it's made for the PS3? Okay.
[1:02:35] <+wickedends> I HAVE TO KILL CHAOS!!!!!!!!!!!
[1:02:35] <Papa_Bearman> It was a 45-minute presentation and 4/9 of it was on Guardians of the Galaxy.
[1:02:39] <missingangle> If they called it ANYTHING ELSE it'd be fine
[1:02:39] <abuse_of_juice> TELEMPATHY
[1:02:39] <%RenegadeHatter> Bahamut Chaos
[1:02:40] <+darkmithrionx> Shade must be thrown
[1:02:41] <%ThomasOfTroy> @PeachSaliva You guys gonna watch the Back 4 Blood stream at 5?
[1:02:43] <M4eta> THATS NOT EMPATHY
[1:02:43] <Gorshum> She can feel your confusion with her empathy power
[1:02:44] <therealtacopancakes> telEmpathy
[1:02:44] <%dankjerri> the writer is confused
[1:02:45] <+Aceofstaves> It's hokey white girl 'empath' empathy tho
[1:02:45] <%Bt_Robot> Platinum Live-Service game.
[1:02:46] <CappuccinoGuil> I think it's because Empathy makes it easier to understand than Telepathy in a pitch.
[1:02:47] <+flexin_apex> Gimme scorn already
[1:02:48] <$JoshManVGH> Or your forcible manipulation of their feelings and psyche?
[1:02:48] <+crocodile_t34rz> CHAOOOOS!
[1:02:49] <+michingmallecho> I'm really interested in the Pixel remaster of FF1-6. I think they're actually going to bring the proper versions to steam
[1:02:49] <deviljhojho_> chaos empathy
[1:02:50] <Jetsfantasy> They're banking on you not knowing the definition of empathy
[1:02:51] <mental_mashup> So square had the worst fucking presentation ever. They‚Äôre gonna kill themselves with the marvel shit
[1:02:52] <+macbojack> I don't think dame developers know what empathy is...
[1:02:52] <+Catpurnicus> No, its "THE PSYCHIC POWER OF EMPATHY" (tm)
[1:02:54] <+RealThiele> that evil dead game looks hype
[1:02:55] <krewl123> will you watch the stream at 5?
[1:02:55] <SweetCuppingCake> Nothing gunna save that Guardians of the Galaxy game. Like Pat said, that‚Äôs coming out way too soon
[1:02:55] <Spiralpower1620> I'm honestly interested in the Guardians Game
[1:02:59] <SGrim> @Papa_Bearman And it wasn't even interesting
[1:03:03] <Sotetsu> I would love to see you play Life is Strange.
[1:03:04] <tanarath> back 4 blood, huh
[1:03:05] <Papa_Bearman> Not entirely, no.
[1:03:09] <JetpackMcQuack> whatever
[1:03:09] <+flexin_apex> @spiralpower1620 Same
[1:03:13] <+HiroTSK5> That was new
[1:03:15] <moonmintparadise> I THINK THEY HAD NOTHING NEW TO SHOW
[1:03:15] <+AdamElJefe> RIGHT?
[1:03:15] <%legendfather_of_giants> @PeachSaliva Max is going on Twitch Gaming to ask about the Square stuff RN.
[1:03:15] <SerpentScintilla> i feel like I took mental damage watching
[1:03:17] <Coystick> 16 isn't a CHAOS number
[1:03:18] <Dunmarkh> chaos
[1:03:18] <theKingRamses> but chaos tho
[1:03:19] <$Puhff> what?
[1:03:19] <+Imperial_Madman> Left 4 dead was my first steam game
[1:03:19] <Darren716> @PeachSaliva Know if Pat is doing the PC Gaming show?
[1:03:20] <TrafficCohen> CHAOS
[1:03:21] <+Ritei> western conference, not a focus for them
[1:03:23] <+dayz1003> BUT MARVEL THOUGH
[1:03:23] <Astrophizz> most mainline games don't show anything for years after the first trailer
[1:03:25] <DianaTheAscian> they never do that
[1:03:27] <%dankjerri> the XIV conference is now where all the final fantasy is
[1:03:28] <TurtlesAndTentacles> @PeachSaliva Maybe they saving for SONY
[1:03:29] <+Shishi1205> Babylon being a GAS is baffling
[1:03:29] <+cvp5127> marvel ft square enix
[1:03:30] <majindusto> People  blaming  NOMURA  still for everything  is fucking annoying
[1:03:30] <+Ritei> probably will be at tgs
[1:03:30] <$Puhff> Why would they just show the same trailer again????
[1:03:30] <Coystick> Marvel=Chaos
[1:03:32] <balthazar758> that's all they had
[1:03:33] <+gwanzan> is 16 even going to come out in 2022?
[1:03:33] <theognightcrawler> Square Twitter accounts all went private
[1:03:35] <+ParryLurr> that marvel shit went on forever
[1:03:37] <+RealThiele> marvel is strangling them to death with costs id guess
[1:03:37] <balthazar758> lol
[1:03:37] <%Bt_Robot> GOTG is just gonna suck.

[1:03:41] <PanicSwytch> CHAOS
[1:03:43] <mental_mashup> The new final fantasy thing they showed looked like a ps3 game
[1:03:43] <+cvp5127> LUL

[1:03:44] <+wickedends> who cares all about that trash, FFVIIR > all, you buy now

[1:04:40] <+king_of_beggars> It's for communicating with corporate entities and if the entity does bad then that's what gets communicated.
[1:04:43] <+neo_crimson> Nah no sympathy
[1:04:43] <%Bt_Robot> Write a letter?
[1:04:43] <+OrangeMDT> It‚Äôs there job to receive the feedback

[1:04:50] <Jetsfantasy> We all do, but they're the sacrificial lamb(s)
[1:04:52] <shieldecho> Hey maybe don't do death threats. Maybe that's a thing you can do on your end. Maybe the internet might be improved a little if people didn't do death threats over video games.
[1:04:53] <%legendfather_of_giants> @vVAstrAVv he didn't record a VOD because DMCA
[1:04:53] <%ThomasOfTroy> Dog is chonky

[1:04:58] <Coystick> Zangief will heal the stream
[1:04:58] <%OswaldTheDog> the point of social media isn‚Äôt to be a jackass but it seems that‚Äôs what people always wanna be
[1:04:59] <+BallinArbiter> It‚Äôs not the Twitter guys fault but that conference was so bad
[1:04:59] <PunkZedB> c o n s u m e
[1:04:59] <Prevot> actually the point of social media is to let us bully huge corporations

[1:05:11] <shieldecho> LOOK AT HIM
[1:05:13] <HumanAdventure> I think calling out marketing people for their BS is fair, so long as it's not death threats are full-on harassment.
[1:05:13] <Melchior_the_Wise> he's going to be like Clifford one day

[1:08:59] <Daniel_Is_I> GEX
[1:09:00] <awalbaru> Imagine good games LUL
[1:09:00] <+xmetalicdemonx> THE DARK CHAOS
[1:09:01] <+cvp5127> short attention span
[1:09:02] <PunkZedB> as they're fighting too
[1:09:03] <%ssjklyco> it looks like a Koei Techmo game
[1:09:03] <goose_coward> just like in the films
[1:09:04] <%Garthunox> next LiS game "I have the chameleons greatest power! And its the claws! I have the claws of a chameleon!"
[1:09:04] <peachy996> Chaos Control
[1:09:05] <coreyyotto> Have you ever talked while walking? It's tiring
[1:09:06] <RoldanDgr8> also the designs being so boring
[1:09:06] <Dunmarkh> BECAUSE THEY NEED TO KILL CHAOS
[1:09:06] <+Kriptin> WE HAVE TO KILL KAY-OSS
[1:09:06] <+razielhex> WALK & TALK.
[1:09:07] <Sporkgasm> What CHAOS do CHAOS you CHAOS mean CHAOS about CHAOS the CHAOS dialogue?
[1:09:07] <Profmcstevie> They are afraid of empty air
[1:09:07] <Coystick> NIOH was a FUCKING fluke for Team Ninja
[1:09:09] <%legendfather_of_giants> because Joss Whedon
[1:09:10] <amiavamp> Because that's how Marvel movies are written
[1:09:10] <+McSoliace> tbf it is the the guardians
[1:09:12] <+eanscrale> To make it seem like you're doing somethin
[1:09:13] <antimatter_man> Yeah uh
[1:09:13] <illtima> Remember Nioh 2's INCREDIBLE character creator? Well fuck you, play as this piece of white bread now.
[1:09:15] <+xmetalicdemonx> THE DARKNESS IS BRINGING OUT THE CHAOS
[1:09:16] <Cosairen> CHAOS CHAOS
[1:09:17] <nomolomo> ff xv had that too and i found it to be maddening
[1:09:18] <%Bt_Robot> Should the new game be called "Life is Jessica?"
[1:09:18] <CatRidder> yes
[1:09:21] <Dunmarkh> CHAOS
[1:09:23] <cardamomo88> CHAOS
[1:09:23] <RenniGlo> when it's nonstop talk it's bad. I need some peace every once in awhile
[1:09:23] <Prevot> why is paige throwing a buttplug for gief to catch
[1:09:24] <+Pendlez> big baby dog
[1:09:24] <Profmcstevie> It's same with some streamer advice to always talk even if you have nothing to say
[1:09:25] <Dragovus> @PeachSaliva You need the walk and talk cause how else do they hide the load
[1:09:25] <antimatter_man> theres another fix for making your playtesters bored
[1:09:26] <+Captainahab_37> we gotta kill Chaos
[1:09:27] <+HiroTSK5> NieR does the walk and talk well
[1:09:27] <goose_coward> that boy has serious momentum
[1:09:27] <Sunstalker> REMEMBER WHEN OUR PROTAGONISTS WERE MUTE AND WE LIKED IT?
[1:09:29] <SaltyGuyMan> Bad Company was amazing for random squad chats
[1:09:32] <%dankjerri> because marvel funny haha ADHD comedy haha
[1:09:33] <nomolomo> yeah dragon age does it great! all their conversations were super interesting to hear
[1:09:33] <peachyprimrose> CHAOOOOOOS
[1:09:34] <SummonerMagno> yakuza 7 with the random conversations
[1:09:35] <DianaTheAscian> the guardians never stfu in the movies as well
[1:09:35] <%baronblank> that ff origins guy looks like a 360 shooter man
[1:09:35] <parkslady> aww
[1:09:36] <+DrFacilier> One of the worst E3s in a while?
[1:09:36] <mythoclyst> Nomura's Favorite color pallet.
[1:09:36] <KineticZen> It's the same thing that happened to the Netflix MST3K reboot, you have so many writers wanting to cram their one-liners in that nothing has time to breathe at all, and it's just constant noise
[1:09:36] <+wickedends> CHAOS
[1:09:39] <$Solidnick18> NEED CHAOS
[1:09:39] <wohdin> the constant talking is why i HATED dragon‚Äôs dogma
[1:09:41] <peachy996> Because you need to fill the silence.
[1:09:41] <justcallmebobplease> That's Arin's Sonic Voice!
[1:09:42] <+tsubakiparadox> Dragon age only has people talk when shits HAPPENING. when it's just walking, they shut up
[1:09:44] <+michingmallecho> CHAOS KomodoHype KomodoHype
[1:09:46] <%Aeogard> drakengard/nier do in battle dialogue really well imo
[1:09:46] <+RealThiele> i hope those guys die horribly
[1:09:47] <chimeraxmachina> I love walking in silence while playing, it‚Äôs such a calming feeling
[1:09:48] <nomolomo> and they actually said something that mattered and flashed out their characters more
[1:09:51] <%ssjklyco> Final Fantasy Shadow the Hedgehog
[1:09:53] <+bluguu> Bouncer 2 would have been a pop off
[1:09:54] <weirdee> C H A O S
[1:09:55] <+razielhex> @PeachSaliva It's SORKIN TIME!  Walk & Talk Baby!  Walk & Talk!
[1:09:57] <balthazar758> bad company 2 triggers dialogue if you stand still for awhile. you control it.
[1:09:57] <coreyyotto> That too
[1:09:57] <peachy996> Any silence must be FILLED with Quirky Dialogue
[1:09:58] <+crocodile_t34rz> But Garland getting his voice back is fantastic. Love that voice actor
[1:09:58] <JetpackMcQuack> kinamaHmm
[1:10:00] <+InvertableQuasar> There was literally just no pauses
[1:10:03] <Murcielagoincursio> "Life is therapy"
[1:10:06] <+eanscrale> the Platcom final fantasy
[1:10:06] <+streamtouched> ff origin featuring shadow the hedgehog
[1:10:07] <$Solidnick18> play one of them i guess
[1:10:12] <Coystick> Everyone is allowed to bully Square until TGS
[1:10:14] <viewtifulr> it's filler
[1:10:16] <%lKaleidoscopel> @skotgun thanks for the sub
[1:10:18] <+tweedler92> Why was the main character just wearing a henly?
[1:10:19] <therealtacopancakes> versus and 13
[1:10:19] <mental_mashup> Team ninja does not handle other people IP‚Äôs well
[1:10:21] <AthenaAegis> Because we didn't learn well enough with Other M and Ninja Gaiden 3 Kappa
[1:10:22] <%baka_sugoi> B A D
[1:10:23] <gamezerox> Gotta use that FF7 engine
[1:10:23] <+superrhubarbpie> strangers looks like 2 gens behind of action game development
[1:10:23] <awalbaru> THe worst I think
[1:10:25] <depotagents> gief highlight of e3
[1:10:25] <KineticZen> This company doesn't deserve FFXIV
[1:10:27] <+Shishi1205> one is dmc the other is nioh @PeachSaliva
[1:10:28] <+MugenSandan> Who exactly is the one that keeps trying to make FF into something ultra edgey!?
[1:10:28] <+Massimoman64> butt
[1:10:28] <+michingmallecho> The action game by platinum looks slower than Ff16. How
[1:10:30] <shieldecho> psaBig psaDogchamp
[1:10:31] <Raikouija> One is Soulsborne the other is character action
[1:10:31] <+Rusty_beartrap> Would you say it exceeded your expectations?
[1:10:32] <CappuccinoGuil> All of them, yes
[1:10:32] <MichelangeloStark> Avengers License and the Multiverse of Sadness
[1:10:33] <%Treuan> Uh-oh
[1:10:33] <+king_of_beggars> It's every nephew of every Platinum employee, put on a single team.
[1:10:34] <dagreenpillow> Someone say the director for FF:O is the people who made FF13 so yeah
[1:10:35] <tsundingus> square enix USA
[1:10:35] <$JoshManVGH> Why is the Warrior of Light, William from Nioh?
[1:10:35] <roz_en> It looks like something Nomura wanted to do, but couldn't get proper backing behind it
[1:10:37] <+Ritei> they did
[1:10:37] <%Chichen> @PeachSaliva not true. They merged accounts a while ago
[1:10:38] <cardamomo88> the usa one I think
[1:10:38] <mythoclyst> Nomura
[1:10:39] <+dayz1003> it is true.
[1:10:39] <+streamtouched> CHAOS control
[1:10:40] <Daniel_Is_I> @PeachSaliva That's an old defunct account apparently
[1:10:40] <Madax_Rixala> Sadly disappointed
[1:10:40] <Darren716> Oh boo hoo
[1:10:40] <Sausious> fake btw
[1:10:44] <bob900000> fake
[1:10:44] <Papa_Bearman> The only reason anyone liked their 2019 presentation is because it was the 'Final Fantasy VII' presentation.
[1:10:46] <Sporkgasm> they have so many IP's people care about and choose to do nothing with so many of them
[1:10:46] <%Ranryu692> every account except the main account has gone private
[1:10:46] <CappuccinoGuil> It's true
[1:10:46] <+toficque> no feedback
[1:10:47] <catloafffing> squareenixusa is locked
[1:10:48] <+cappyd33> its true
[1:10:50] <%Chichen> @PeachSaliva not true. Its OLD account
[1:10:51] <Jrocy247> The SquareEnixUSA is locked, the Main one is not
[1:10:52] <SaltyGuyMan> nah it's just the regional ones privated since they merged with the main acc
[1:10:53] <popipopomipo> it's true
[1:10:54] <+dayz1003> It is true, Squarenixusa went private
[1:10:54] <wibbwobbler> Pretty bland designs for that new ff
[1:10:55] <+BlueHolli> it's absolutely true
[1:10:56] <+xmetalicdemonx> nah be mean
[1:10:56] <afronooch> thats a meme.
[1:10:56] <depotagents> square didn't lock, the square usa account merged with the main square enix account
[1:10:58] <Coystick> I'm gonna be super toxic to them
[1:10:58] <PinoProxie> SquareEnixUSA locked
[1:10:58] <+Shaggnar> It is true LUL
[1:10:58] <goose_coward> gamers are the meanest
[1:10:59] <generalve> Zangief you okay bud ?
[1:10:59] <merantian> @MichelangeloStark fucking well done sir
[1:11:01] <Daxalog> Are you going to show the pc gaming show?
[1:11:02] <%Garthunox> Its a brand
[1:11:03] <CalderGaming> you can fact check this RIGHT NOW
[1:11:03] <peachy996> The account is probably like "stop saying Chaos at us you fucks"
[1:11:04] <PinoProxie> HEART BUTT
[1:11:05] <DianaTheAscian> its fake paige
[1:11:06] <%Garthunox> fuck the brand
[1:11:08] <$JoshManVGH> More not western shit!
[1:11:09] <dukenux> they want to KILL CHAOS
[1:11:09] <+gwanzan> how can they be mean;  S-E cut off their social media
[1:11:11] <Solidus_113> Origins is being directed by the guy who directed FF13, Lighting Returns, and Dirge
[1:11:12] <+eanscrale> Nah
[1:11:12] <NeverNotNinja> Square Enix's Twitter hasn't mentioned Final CHAOS
[1:11:12] <Madax_Rixala> Looks like FF:O has class change so that looks cool.
[1:11:13] <@commanderclaw> "Dear Final Fantasy Forum, I never thought it would happen to me"
[1:11:14] <MichelangeloStark> @merantian Thank you kind person!
[1:11:16] <%OswaldTheDog> It‚Äôs true

[1:11:33] <amiavamp> Gief practicing his command throws
[1:11:36] <viewtifulr> they hate the britsh
[1:11:37] <%Garthunox> THEY COULDVE SHOWED THE ENDWALKER TRAILER
[1:11:37] <Papa_Bearman> That is a cartoon dog.
[1:11:42] <Coystick> He loves it
[1:11:43] <karovus> we got like 1 second of ff16 footage and it looked infinitely more interesting than anything else they showed
[1:11:43] <coreyyotto> It's been a long time since I've genuinely thought that I would rather have nothing
[1:11:53] <peachy996> It only makes him crazier
