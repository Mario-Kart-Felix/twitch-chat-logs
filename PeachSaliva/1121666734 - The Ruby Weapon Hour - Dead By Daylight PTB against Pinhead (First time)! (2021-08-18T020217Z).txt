[0:05:29] <rudiciuscaesar> I stay off Twitter though because that shit is poisonous.
[0:05:54] <@SoFarFetched> @rudiciuscaesar its actually this one https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gT5bsym1Cug
[0:06:03] <%SMuffinMan> LFGGGG
[0:06:37] <rudiciuscaesar> @SoFarFetched thanks, I didn't recognize this remix, I just knew it was Spider Dance from like 4 notes in lol.
[0:06:53] <rudiciuscaesar> I listen to that song at least once a day on my way to work because I need to be hype...
[0:06:57] <@SoFarFetched> But its not spider dance LUL
[0:07:16] <Meltgar> PINHEAD LARRY time?!
[0:07:21] <rudiciuscaesar> It has part of it in it, like right now.
[0:07:29] <@MistyMntns> It is Pinhead Larry Time!!
[0:07:31] <rudiciuscaesar> if we're hearing it at the same time though, idk how that time delay works
[0:07:45] <@SoFarFetched> yeah but I mean if we're going by song title cover.
[0:07:54] <SpaceManHotepIV> who're you callin pinhead
[0:08:10] <NoHoldsBarredProductions> sipsipDab

[0:08:37] <rudiciuscaesar> I was like "wtf is this, they added another boss? weird."
[0:08:42] <+realm_forge> This song makes me sad that Undertale doesn’t have its own theme park
[0:08:42] <@MistyMntns> Jesus That line is going to be SPAMMED to no hell today.
[0:08:48] <Meltgar> @rudiciuscaesar It actually had a switch trailer ALTHOUGH i don't remember if it was a stream or normal trailer

[0:10:07] <rudiciuscaesar> I mean shit, I'm still playing Skyrim, SF4, and AOE3. And Undertale original, sometimes.

[0:10:44] <@SoFarFetched> sometimes you can't beat the classics when it comes to video games geefPlz
[0:10:49] <rudiciuscaesar> man, that Switch release though, that day, I worked that, I had to come in 2 hours early to set up, it was great. Had a blast selling it on launch.
[0:10:57] <+realm_forge> @rudiciuscaesar you never stop playing Skyrim. You just take long breaks

[0:11:10] <%JoshManVGH> pro life advice: puzzle boxes are great fun. and a good way to engage your brain. Do NOT complete any puzzles with the words "lament" or "configuration" in their title.
[0:11:10] <+SWFanatic> yeyeye
[0:11:10] <hearingthenseeing> it's time
[0:11:11] <@SoFarFetched> Just like  Todd Howard will never stop re-releasing skyrim

[0:13:24] <@MistyMntns> His Moobs are out and his pouch is out as well.
[0:13:26] <luckykae> never watched the movies pinhead is in
[0:13:32] <rudiciuscaesar> Cenobite always terrified me since that's a rank in my church and I feel they never bothered to see if that title was ever used for anything creepy in media.

[0:14:03] <rudiciuscaesar> I've seen it
[0:14:03] <%freelancebabymaker> hellraiser fucks dude
[0:14:03] <%sick_kickflips> many moons ago
[0:14:04] <AFlyingTaco1> Does he have a special attack where the other cenobites are featured?
[0:14:05] <@SoFarFetched> I was going to at some point.
[0:14:05] <$Weeabooninja> nope
[0:14:05] <%SMuffinMan> Yeah that movie RULES
[0:14:05] <@Jekado> yeah a long time ago
[0:14:06] <%JimmyRuss> I saw it when I was 12
[0:14:08] <hearingthenseeing> no like needles
[0:14:09] <%GojiraKira> yup
[0:14:10] <+KingKrampus> never have
[0:14:11] <rudiciuscaesar> but I am a huge baby and it freaks me out
[0:14:11] <%Dirty_Dandere> Yeeeee
[0:14:12] <%JimmyRuss> Thanks Dad
[0:14:14] <@Jekado> yeah.... 20 years...
[0:14:16] <AFlyingTaco1> Yeah it's a tri
[0:14:16] <ergulor> Sadly no
[0:14:17] <Mohawk_Sandwich> read the book. it's badasscool
[0:14:21] <@Jekado> yeah the effects are Great!
[0:14:22] <AFlyingTaco1> *trip
[0:14:26] <@Jekado> i miss practical effects
[0:14:26] <ergulor> oh there are books? nice
[0:14:26] <Meltgar> Didn't know Hellrazer had sequels
[0:14:26] <@SoFarFetched> @AFlyingTaco1 just him,his add-ons mention the other cenobites.
[0:14:27] <rudiciuscaesar> and Pinhead is the most normal of the cenobites.
[0:14:31] <SlimeBasher> my pitch for a kids show is "The Cenobabies"
[0:14:32] <%JoshManVGH> Clive Barker did not fuck around
[0:14:32] <FlashFrame> They did all that on a VERY tight budget too.
[0:14:35] <zavi_dior> recommend?
[0:14:37] <rudiciuscaesar> yeah, relatively around
[0:14:38] <%brokendarktower> luv the 1st movie the creator Clive barkers a bit problematic tho,
[0:14:39] <%GojiraKira> closish
[0:14:45] <%JoshManVGH> Isn't The Thing also Clive Barker?
[0:14:45] <@Jekado> no survivor is weird
[0:14:49] <%mckraven> @peachsaliva its amazing that the movie is still a toned down version compared to how much the book fucks
[0:14:50] <%AncelDeLambert> I can't handle horror
[0:14:53] <%freelancebabymaker> clive barker is like gay british stephen king
[0:14:53] <benjiFG> marathon the other 9 movies and stream it :D
[0:14:54] <%MarylandJutsu> @PeachSaliva does he have sights to show you?
[0:14:57] <+qanonisadeathcult> the lore of the cenobites is the greatest
[0:15:03] <AFlyingTaco1> @SoFarFetched That's unfortunate, but not unexpected. Still cool he's in.
[0:15:06] <+OmegaGrimoire> just the first one?
[0:15:12] <FlashFrame> Yeah the book is way more hardcore.
[0:15:15] <%JimmyRuss> Hellraiser as a webdev: I have such sites to show you.
[0:15:20] <SlimeBasher> It gets fucking WILD
[0:15:23] <@SoFarFetched> yeaahh
[0:15:24] <%JoshManVGH> Nvm, The Thing was John Carpenter
[0:15:24] <AFlyingTaco1> @PeachSaliva Which part scared you the hardest?
[0:15:28] <rudiciuscaesar> I forget which one terrified me the most, there's one of the sequels with a female cenobite and just the sight of her freaks me out
[0:15:31] <%MarylandJutsu> yeah they have diminsihing returns
[0:15:31] <Meltgar> Pinhead's torture scenes got STUCKED in my mind forever as a kid LUL
[0:15:35] <%JoshManVGH> 2 is alright, and then... yeah
[0:15:35] <+Ne1son> 1 and 2 are very good
[0:15:36] <%AncelDeLambert> how many did Jay like?
[0:15:39] <%sick_kickflips> it's crazy that they've made 10
[0:15:39] <+OmegaGrimoire> they get worse the higher the number LUL
[0:15:43] <%MarylandJutsu> oh yeah frank being all gross
[0:15:44] <rudiciuscaesar> Frank...
[0:15:50] <TheCrispyBoi> 2 is good
[0:15:52] <%freelancebabymaker> yeah thats a wet movie
[0:15:53] <%samTUMZfestival> Always Sunny?
[0:15:58] <%ComfortableStranger> oooh pinhead
[0:16:01] <rudiciuscaesar> fucking gonna go look up Frank cuz I can't remember...
[0:16:02] <%MarylandJutsu> the evil stepmom ye
[0:16:03] <FlashFrame> something like 10, and there's a reboot on the way.
[0:16:04] <AFlyingTaco1> The second movie is fucking metal
[0:16:15] <+qanonisadeathcult> There's a few in the middle that are not great.
[0:16:20] <krewl123> the devs have wanted the cenobites for like a lonnnnnnnnnnnnnng time
[0:16:22] <%MarylandJutsu> oh yeah, the lengths to which that woman goes
[0:16:24] <+Ne1son> Naw she's just a freak
[0:16:25] <AFlyingTaco1> Crazy puss is tempting to the dick
[0:16:29] <%JoshManVGH> Wouldn't the dick also be like... flayed?
[0:16:34] <%Dirty_Dandere> LUL
[0:16:34] <%maskofmichael> 12 inches
[0:16:38] <godzookylives> @PeachSaliva the second movie is even gorier
[0:16:45] <@MistyMntns> He also SPEAKS in game
[0:16:45] <%mckraven> @joshmanvgh yeah and she likes that
[0:16:47] <%MarylandJutsu> yeah when she first met him
[0:16:48] <+patriotrenegade> flayed for her pleasure
[0:16:51] <rudiciuscaesar> OH GOD
[0:16:53] <%JoshManVGH> Oooh
[0:16:54] <rudiciuscaesar> I just watched
[0:16:55] <rudiciuscaesar> fuck that
[0:16:58] <%samTUMZfestival> My kitten came upstairs to say hello.
[0:16:59] <%JimmyRuss> The twins who put their hands under your skin?
[0:17:02] <zavi_dior> Pinhead gives me BDSM  vibes
[0:17:04] <+mikesapartment> what the FUCK there's 10 movies
[0:17:05] <%JimmyRuss> Creepy and spooky hot
[0:17:07] <%MarylandJutsu> Zangief!...i mean Pinhead....speak
[0:17:10] <ChrisPlaysThing> I got an add for ghost pepper KD, what fresh nightmare inspired that
[0:17:15] <@MistyMntns> @PeachSaliva He says one line and it will get ingrained into your head.
[0:17:17] <%freelancebabymaker> @zavi_dior oh you have no idead
[0:17:20] <DanThePumpkinman> hope he gets a skin that is female cenobite
[0:17:28] <%CptCreampuff16> make bigger

[0:17:37] <%SilverJakler> SilverJakler subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 20 months! If they ever add a FNAF rep it should definitely be Springtrap. Wonder what he could do?
[0:17:38] <%JoshManVGH> They Cenobites come from a dimension of Pure Pleasure, if that answers any questions.
[0:17:38] <President_Pariah> Pinhead is hilarious, whenever he teleports to you he says, "You opened the box...I CAME" LUL
[0:17:39] <+KingKrampus> ENLORGE BOOB
[0:17:41] <hearingthenseeing> BIG and STRONG
[0:17:42] <%MarylandJutsu> @MistyMntns is it ""we have such sights to show you?"
[0:17:43] <rudiciuscaesar> whenever a girl says "hey, I found my whips and chains" If you were around for the 80s, like me, that sentence will terrify you lol
[0:17:44] <Burncoat> The two comics I saw were pretty great. The cenobites being full on "We're only here for those that deserve it"
[0:17:53] <zavi_dior> @freelancebabymaker Gone make me act up
[0:18:00] <%patriotrenegade> Everyday I drink 8 fluid ounces of 5G-permeated fluoridated water. My pineal gland has calcified to such an extant that it can stop small arms fire

[0:18:05] <@MistyMntns> Its that Line
[0:18:08] <Meekest> Guess what he's gonna say a lot
[0:18:09] <%JimmyRuss> Hellraiser has a pin in his head for every time someone says his famous line
[0:18:12] <CrimsonFox777> Kreygasm
[0:18:14] <%MarylandJutsu> oh is t Misty?
[0:18:23] <%patriotrenegade> patriotrenegade subscribed with Prime. They've subscribed for 4 months, currently on a 2 month streak! Everyday I drink 8 fluid ounces of 5G-permeated fluoridated water. My pineal gland has calcified to such an extant that it can stop small arms fire
[0:18:25] <+realm_forge> Am I the only one who wants to see Pinhead fight Lady Dimitrescu?
[0:18:28] <ChrisPlaysThing> So if you open the box, he dumps the paint, got it
[0:18:33] <@MistyMntns> Number
[0:18:47] <@SoFarFetched> you mean how EVERYONE keeps saying Springtrap
[0:18:53] <Meltgar> SPOILERS TO THOSE WHO HAVENT SEEN THE MOVIE-----------------------------------------------I didn't knew Pinhead was "Lawful" evil
[0:18:54] <%freelancebabymaker> i marathoned all of the hellraiser once when there were only 9 of them and it was ROUGH
[0:18:55] <ergulor> i still think it should be freddy
[0:18:56] <%Zeif00> FNAF fans on twitter were LIVID today
[0:18:59] <ergulor> is in the fukng name
[0:19:00] <@MistyMntns> FNAF fan needs to just chiillllll
[0:19:15] <+KingKrampus> @zeif00 why where they livid
[0:19:22] <+Ne1son> Instead we could have no Fnaf and be better off
[0:19:24] <%SilverJakler> OH I'm glad that Pinhead is in, don't get me wrong
[0:19:27] <+realm_forge> PLAY FNAF ON STREAM!,,,,
[0:19:31] <ChrisPlaysThing> Maybe it can stop snake shot
[0:19:33] <%mckraven> @meltgar best is all about the rules
[0:19:33] <@MistyMntns> @Ne1son This right here.
[0:19:41] <@SoFarFetched> @KingKrampus because it was Hellraiser and not FNAF
[0:19:44] <hearingthenseeing> if you have to ask
[0:19:46] <%freelancebabymaker> springtrap is probably the most interesting fnaf character but he could totally be reskinned as like normal freddy or golden freddy

[0:21:43] <%MarylandJutsu> jenna no!
[0:21:45] <%patriotrenegade> "The Entity"
[0:21:45] <FlashFrame> So, this lore implies that Pinhead wasn't summoned by the Entity, he just kinda, showed up.

[0:30:57] <%freelancebabymaker> hellraiser 1 and 2 are like some of my go to horror movies i love them
[0:30:57] <Elite_Beat_Gator> They all drunk
[0:31:00] <@Jekado> NO TIME FOR DANCING!!!
[0:31:01] <benjiFG> "can I an hooker" -PeachSaliva
[0:31:04] <rudiciuscaesar> crab walker
[0:31:06] <%superc37> @PeachSaliva try finding the puzzle box?
[0:31:06] <@SoFarFetched> MOONWALK LIKE A SMOOTH CRIMINAL
[0:31:07] <scrumbotime> she has doo doo booty
[0:31:10] <Ghostbusttyler> That chain dumpy
[0:31:16] <qaaj> Chain in your ass, oof
[0:31:17] <@MistyMntns> Get the booooox
[0:31:18] <HotSauceFiend> what happens at max chain?
[0:31:22] <rudiciuscaesar> lmao that hook out the ass, I saw that while in mid-drink and almost snorted out my Dr. Pepper
[0:31:29] <+Emperor_Machinus> crab walk to victory, mp pme will find out you pooped your pants
[0:31:42] <@SoFarFetched> yeah you and steve hjave the problem
[0:31:44] <@SoFarFetched> Nea is fine
[0:31:45] <+MitchPfitz> everyone is chained. is it even possible to win?
[0:31:50] <%AncelDeLambert> this round is borked
[0:31:51] <%freelancebabymaker> this is so goofy looking lol
[0:31:54] <+Anime_Flux> hahahaha
[0:32:00] <%MooseIsGoose> The poop face
[0:32:02] <AFlyingTaco1> LUL Cenobite too OP, he defies the laws of the game with bugs
[0:32:03] <%freelancebabymaker> PAIN AND PLEASURE
[0:32:06] <%graemecrackers2> lol
[0:32:10] <rudiciuscaesar> the cenobite hooks inflict IBS?
[0:32:11] <+GenesisPatton> You've already pooped yourself. May as well just let yourself die. Avoid the shame.
[0:32:15] <Burncoat> I think breaking the chains with the environment avoids the bug better than taking it off manually?
[0:32:15] <qaaj> Not the best showcase, but this is the public beta, right?
[0:32:16] <%TheWinged7> just an average monday night Kappa
[0:32:17] <@Jekado> new killer that makes you shit your pants.
[0:32:17] <+Anime_Flux> backward dumps
[0:32:17] <%graemecrackers2> test build tho
[0:32:21] <%Ell1ot> that's the face i make when i take a dump while standing
[0:32:22] <MiamiMemory> I hope this doesn't awaken anything in me
[0:32:37] <@SoFarFetched> I didnt  think it'd be RIGHT off the bat
[0:32:40] <@SoFarFetched> I was expecting a few bugs
[0:32:48] <cannamom89> lmao wtf
[0:32:49] <@SoFarFetched> ahh spooked me
[0:32:50] <President_Pariah> i was watching a streamer earlier, that bug happens like EVERY match
[0:32:52] <OmegaWeltall> Demons to some Angels to others
[0:32:57] <rudiciuscaesar> maybe it will be the only time it happens
[0:32:58] <%graemecrackers2> how did you enjoy the Hellraiser films ? @PeachSaliva
[0:33:13] <@SoFarFetched> oh yeah they changed MMR color ranking
[0:33:18] <%JaydenSai> JaydenSai subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 50 months! 50 months? Thats like half of 100 months! Thanks for the fun times Paige, you da best!
[0:33:38] <HotSauceFiend> why are your rank symbols different colors?
[0:33:41] <+SciFiBrony> What's the bug? I just got in here 😆
[0:33:51] <@SoFarFetched> update
[0:33:58] <@SoFarFetched> cause PTB shows the updates that will go Live later
[0:34:01] <President_Pariah> early impressions are pinhead looks great but feels very weak power wise, decent perks tho
[0:34:36] <@SoFarFetched> yeah PTB showed some updates
[0:34:37] <@Jekado> @SciFiBrony the new killer's harrasment power sometimes never shuts off.
[0:34:43] <$Weeabooninja> who is the new survivor?
[0:34:47] <@Jekado> no one
[0:34:49] <@Jekado> just a killer
[0:35:05] <@SoFarFetched> they said the next killer/survivor would be seperate
[0:35:09] <President_Pariah> the streamers i watched said he's a lot like Clown but MUCH more complicated for a weaker effect, needs some tweaking
[0:35:13] <rudiciuscaesar> Kristy yeah
[0:35:15] <FlashFrame> I played him for a bit, he's a bit lacking overall, and coordinated teams can easily wreck him. But he's fun to play as and against.
[0:35:17] <CrimsonFox777> Have we already made a "Who you callin' Pinhead?" joke?
[0:35:18] <%GojiraKira> I haven't experienced the bugs from his perspective, but I could definitely tell something was up from how the survivors were acting
[0:35:18] <krewl123> hey peach just want you to know the devs have wanted a cenobite for like a long time so the devs are really happy to get the hellraiser licensee and also he fits so well into the lore
[0:35:25] <%freelancebabymaker> the girl from the first movie is so attractive
[0:35:35] <+InternetShis> Yo Paige, just formatted my PC cause I was getting frequent crashes and low frame desktop afterwards, unsure if I downloaded something fucky
[0:35:44] <Elite_Beat_Gator> And Ghostface didn't come with a Cindy survivor
[0:35:52] <+InternetShis> I'm in the phase of remembering what I downloaded
[0:36:00] <%freelancebabymaker> SHES SO FUCKING PRETTY LIKE
[0:36:02] <GarbageQueenEllie> Mmm
[0:36:03] <Prism_Wing> yeh
[0:36:08] <CandyCoatedConfection> totally
[0:36:10] <%cade_calrayn> She doesn't look like an actress, basically
[0:36:11] <$Weeabooninja> When you say on the street....
[0:36:11] <FlashFrame> The true power of him won't really be figured out until the DLC goes live.
[0:36:12] <krewl123> @Elite_Beat_Gator cause they only licensed the mask not the movies
[0:36:15] <President_Pariah> so you're saying beautiful people don't exist in real life, got it
[0:36:15] <rudiciuscaesar> @freelancebabymaker your screen name is amazing, I felt I had to point that out. I'm not joking, that's one of the best screen names I've ever seen lmao.
[0:36:16] <$NitronStreams> It makes sense
[0:36:18] <benjiFG> yeah the girl with the throat is hot I agree
[0:36:24] <AFlyingTaco1> You mean the main character?
[0:36:24] <%RealThiele> "She looks like a beautiful woman" -Paige
[0:36:25] <sydowoodo> which lady????
[0:36:27] <%freelancebabymaker> kirsty cotton horror movie waifu
[0:36:27] <%isolex_> Girl next door hot is the BEST
[0:36:34] <SpaceManHotepIV> oh man
[0:36:35] <%samTUMZfestival> Dammit Paige
[0:36:41] <scrumbotime> Paige is on the 'roids again and full of power
[0:36:42] <GarbageQueenEllie> Paige go brrrrrr
[0:36:43] <@SoFarFetched> @Elite_Beat_Gator it was just Ghostface for his DLC
[0:36:43] <@Jekado> you're a phone ring tone?
[0:36:49] <%Sotetsu> What is pre-workout?
[0:36:50] <%freelancebabymaker> @rudiciuscaesar ty i make it a point to have amazing gut punch usernames
[0:36:54] <%mckraven> mckraven subscribed with Prime. They've subscribed for 12 months! A full 12 months! I finally got my first job at a AAA game company and your's and Pat's streams have been helping me get through the crunch
[0:36:59] <%Sotetsu> She's full of bees! PrideFloat
[0:37:09] <rudiciuscaesar> wait, wtf is Paige talking about, why she jittering?
[0:37:11] <%cade_calrayn> wait, I thought your hands did that normally, Paige? :P
[0:37:15] <krewl123> peach can be extra goofy?
[0:37:15] <%maskofmichael> "High" Paige
[0:37:15] <%graemecrackers2> i like the Chatterer cenobite he cute
[0:37:28] <%freelancebabymaker> @rudiciuscaesar it was either gonna be freelancebabymaker or barebacksteakhouse lmao
[0:37:30] <%CptCreampuff16> i mean some consider preworkout as a good substitute for adhd medication
[0:37:32] <%CantWalkGood> Wait! Pinhead!? Thats awesome!
[0:37:39] <%AncelDeLambert> I hope you unionize
[0:37:40] <mr_saturday93> congratulations!
[0:37:41] <President_Pariah> pinhead has to aim his chains sorta like Nurse, but it only slows you a little and breaks super easy/fast to be effective
[0:37:42] <%Sotetsu> Make sure to uh oh
[0:37:42] <Nekros4442> I mean he said he's getting crunched
[0:37:44] <+glgzephyr> I mean, they're crunching him, so....
[0:37:46] <Meltgar> YOOOO cool stuff dude
[0:37:47] <Nekros4442> So lets just....
[0:37:49] <%JaydenSai> I know you probably talked about this but man, Stranger Things getting pulled sucks as a Demo main :c @PeachSaliva
[0:37:53] <@Jekado> oh neat it shows who has the box
[0:37:55] <CandyCoatedConfection> he's so talkative. it's weird.
[0:37:58] <+Thesaltt> I still absolutely love your avatar.  I still am so surprised that that you became a Vtuber
[0:38:04] <@MistyMntns> @JaydenSai You can still play him.
[0:38:07] <@SoFarFetched> yeah that message was like "YAY--oohhhh...."  cause "my first job is already crunching me"
[0:38:18] <pipaa88> @jaydensai you can still play with demo
[0:38:23] <AFlyingTaco1> The Thinger Strange
[0:38:26] <%Sotetsu> You keep it if you own it, at least
[0:38:27] <%AncelDeLambert> don't you still get to PLAY as Demogorgan? You just can't buy him anymore
[0:38:29] <%RealThiele> rip steve and nancy
[0:38:31] <CandyCoatedConfection> will their perks stay?
[0:38:32] <rudiciuscaesar> wait, they're gonna remove them from the game?
[0:38:33] <%freelancebabymaker> the things is strange
[0:38:38] <Meltgar> Was it because Copyright? or License?
[0:38:43] <President_Pariah> the Stranger Things DLC pack is ~$4 on GMG
[0:38:44] <PartyFavors> License
[0:38:44] <@SoFarFetched> @AncelDeLambert yeah if you bought the Stranger Things DLC,they're yours forever
[0:38:47] <rudiciuscaesar> yep
[0:38:48] <President_Pariah> yeah the license expired
[0:38:50] <%AncelDeLambert> it happened again
[0:38:54] <AFlyingTaco1> RIP
[0:38:54] <rudiciuscaesar> Paige has been made stranger.
[0:38:57] <@MistyMntns> License thing. Rumor is that they want to make their own game
[0:39:01] <splinter1619> ooh that looked like it worked
[0:39:04] <%Sotetsu> The license ran out, and for whatever reason it wasn't renewed.
[0:39:05] <Decarcassor> As far as I understand you won't be able to purchase them anymore, but they will stay in the gam
[0:39:07] <mr_saturday93> License has expired is what Paige is trying to say
[0:39:09] <@SoFarFetched> The Stranger Things DLC goes on sale later I believe.
[0:39:10] <pipaa88> you can still keep your things, and play as demo or any survivor as long as you have it
[0:39:11] <%joeyduderman> It is going off the store
[0:39:12] <+mikesapartment> all the cosmetics half off too
[0:39:15] <%joeyduderman> and everything is on sale
[0:39:16] <@Jekado> They are making their own game
[0:39:18] <%freelancebabymaker> DEMONS TO SOME.....ANGELS TO OTHERS
[0:39:18] <devanmuse> Wow, those animations look VERY early
[0:39:19] <@Jekado> i think
[0:39:19] <@SoFarFetched> yeah November 17th
[0:39:26] <emper0rner0> Wait I don't think it goes on sale until tomorrow
[0:39:28] <%AncelDeLambert> it's hilarious if the Demogorgan just stays at huge discount until the retirement
[0:39:30] <rudiciuscaesar> ohhhh so they aren't like patched out of the game
[0:39:30] <+glgzephyr> it's 12 dollars right now
[0:39:34] <rudiciuscaesar> you just lose the chance to get them
[0:39:35] <Yuroshi> they'll go on sale tomorrow
[0:39:37] <GarbageQueenEllie> oof hook clip
[0:39:39] <%cade_calrayn> So basically, they're losing the license but trying to give it to everyone they can, that's neat
[0:39:41] <@SoFarFetched> The Perks will turn Generic,instead of character themed.
[0:39:42] <President_Pariah> he came
[0:39:53] <%JaydenSai> I suppose i'm just worried Demo will stop getting reworks and updates
[0:39:55] <benjiFG> flex
[0:39:57] <+nivlac_555> wtf lol
[0:39:58] <%JaydenSai> /shrug
[0:40:01] <Elite_Beat_Gator> I'm glad I bought the DBD Stranger Things Edition on pc and Xbox one x
[0:40:01] <@SoFarFetched> Yeah Cosmetics are 50% off starting tomorrow.
[0:40:01] <%Sotetsu> Wow, unlucky
[0:40:07] <benjiFG> show off your bulging muscles
[0:40:11] <%AncelDeLambert> I hope it's F U levels of on sale
[0:40:12] <%joeyduderman> So do all the skins
[0:40:16] <%AncelDeLambert> because it would be funny
[0:40:16] <splinter1619> permanent no sprinting gg lol
[0:40:18] <+InternetShis> Overkill ran into a similar issue with Payday 2 and the Scarface character DLC, but the mansion map is still available
[0:40:21] <@SoFarFetched> yeah Map is being removed
[0:40:23] <%mckraven> putting it on sale before the license ends us a nice gesture at least
[0:40:26] <Decarcassor> Expect a reskin of the Hawkins lab map.
[0:40:26] <%joeyduderman> Oh thank gooooooood
[0:40:29] <%AncelDeLambert> BUT, didn't people hate that map?
[0:40:31] <Prism_Wing> You can body block at least lol
[0:40:32] <%joeyduderman> that map is the literal worst
[0:40:35] <%Sotetsu> I hope the re-release the map as a generic lab.
[0:40:39] <%rivercitydemon> Hopefully the map gets reskinned
[0:40:41] <%radda343> it'd be easy to reskin demo if they wanted to
[0:40:43] <CandyCoatedConfection> the map is so cool though, it's so pretty. shame 😣
[0:40:47] <President_Pariah> just release the Bawkins Labs map
[0:40:49] <%JaydenSai> If you can find the cube, it makes the bug go away @PeachSaliva
[0:40:50] <%Sotetsu> I love that map
[0:40:53] <splinter1619> I go to Twitter and it's literally 50/50 thank God it's gone and nooooo save the map
[0:40:55] <FlashFrame> yeah it's the worst bug.
[0:40:56] <Elite_Beat_Gator> Moonwalking Kate
[0:40:57] <@SoFarFetched> Finding the cube in the grass though LUL
[0:40:57] <+Mendin> Oh good, Pinhead is  as buggy for survivors side as it is for the killers' side
[0:40:58] <%freelancebabymaker> reskin the demogorgon into the xenomorph or something
[0:41:04] <%joeyduderman> I like it as Trapper
[0:41:12] <@SoFarFetched> she will moonwalk her way over
[0:41:19] <+SaphronBlackbourne> I despised that map, I'm fine letting it go
[0:41:28] <%cade_calrayn> back, back, back it up
[0:41:30] <@SoFarFetched> THE BOOOXX
[0:41:31] <@SoFarFetched> geefFine
[0:41:39] <%JaydenSai> THE BOX
[0:41:42] <krewl123> @freelancebabymaker then they waste a alien update
[0:41:44] <@MistyMntns> The booooooox
[0:41:47] <%freelancebabymaker> that voice actor does a good doug bradley impression
[0:41:56] <quinndan> think they bring the map back with a different skin to it?
[0:41:57] <@SoFarFetched> LUL
[0:41:57] <%cade_calrayn> what's behind Dwight's head?
[0:41:59] <President_Pariah> i'm sure they know
[0:42:00] <+glgzephyr> YOU OPENED IT
[0:42:01] <+logoth_> So much moaning
[0:42:03] <+Anime_Flux> lol
[0:42:08] <Decarcassor> I think it can go away if you get chained again
[0:42:09] <Meltgar> Oh it got bugged???
[0:42:11] <+InternetShis> Love to see it
[0:42:11] <@SoFarFetched> @cade_calrayn crown from anniversary event
[0:42:16] <rudiciuscaesar> they probably have no idea what is happening to your model lmao
[0:42:16] <%AncelDeLambert> you're JUST gonna have to get caught or DC
[0:42:18] <%cade_calrayn> ah thanks Fetchd
[0:42:28] <President_Pariah> anyone that's played a match or two has seen this bug and are just having fun regardless, or trying to
[0:42:36] <+Mendin> His attack animation is difficult to judge, downing survivors who are chained often makes them stay standing, and hook aiming/collision is not great
[0:42:38] <@SoFarFetched> you open up the menu
[0:42:39] <splinter1619> can you flash your light
[0:42:42] <@SoFarFetched> like with the ESC
[0:42:46] <+glgzephyr> It is probably time to hop off the PTB lmao
[0:42:46] <President_Pariah> if you DC you get a 5 min penalty
[0:42:50] <%Sotetsu> If you get hit with the chain power, it fixes it.
[0:42:50] <phantomsleeves> apparently walking backwards and moving side to side fixes it?
[0:42:54] <FlashFrame> just press Escape and leave match
[0:42:58] <hearingthenseeing> use yourself as bait at least?
[0:43:00] <@SoFarFetched> its not your fault
[0:43:01] <VritraReiRei> Alt+F4 Kappa
[0:43:04] <devanmuse> it's funny how you can't get caught by the killer when you WANT him to get you
[0:43:04] <%AncelDeLambert> nothing on the twitter account about a hotfix
[0:43:13] <DanThePumpkinman> it's not your fault dude
[0:43:21] <@SoFarFetched> LUL
[0:43:23] <@Jekado> The killer is so effective it killed PTB geefGasp
[0:43:24] <%freelancebabymaker> please notice me pin daddy

[0:43:27] <%freelancebabymaker> oh my god

[0:43:44] <+Anime_Flux> LUL
[0:43:45] <%cade_calrayn> i left for 30 seconds and come back to hear Paige said "there's voodoo in my butt!"
[0:43:49] <+Mendin> OH, see, you were still standing when downed
[0:43:51] <+Mendin> That's one of them
[0:43:52] <splinter1619> cursed animation
[0:43:52] <Ghostbusttyler> SUCH PLEASURE AND PAIN
[0:43:58] <Dunmarkh> LUL
[0:44:05] <+InternetShis> This game is a mess and I expect nothing less from Overkill
[0:44:15] <DanThePumpkinman> I'd love for Chucky to get into dbd but i have no clue how tf he would work lol
[0:44:17] <%joeyduderman> Peach.  You are such a joy to watch.  I need to do it more often.
[0:44:28] <+Mendin> @DanThePumpkinman Perma-Victor
[0:44:32] <%freelancebabymaker> i need to be careful i keep almost accidentally quoting candyman lmao
[0:44:35] <%cade_calrayn> she really is!
[0:44:43] <+glgzephyr> Paige, it's totally the game's fault lmao
[0:44:43] <pi_in_the_sci> Maybe try another survivor
[0:44:44] <@SoFarFetched> @InternetShis Overkill is PayDay people, this is BeHaviour LUL
[0:44:52] <Dementedpenguin> It's fine Paige. You're entertaining regardless.
[0:44:56] <ChrisPlaysThing> Goldfish mode engaged
[0:44:59] <%joeyduderman> Paige... You are always a mess :P
[0:44:59] <+SciFiBrony> Why are you apologizing? You're not the one bugging the game. It kinda IS the game's fault 😆
[0:45:08] <%Ranryu692> Pasta Rat incoming
[0:45:09] <%freelancebabymaker> what about all the other noises
[0:45:10] <%JaydenSai> Ah you're a delight no matter what Paige, dont apologize!
[0:45:13] <@SoFarFetched> you better order some food
[0:45:15] <$NitronStreams> I smell Pasta
[0:45:15] <@SoFarFetched> geefPoint
[0:45:21] <+InternetShis> @SoFarFetched I'm going crazy, did they just have a promo thing in Payday for DBD?
[0:45:24] <+papa_doomy> Funni stream
[0:45:29] <%Sotetsu> I saw a cool mockup of Chucky where instead of picking up and carrying survivors, he jumped on their back and threatened to slit their throat with a knife. It was an elegant solution to the size problem.
[0:45:34] <peyodogo> :) we can do it
[0:45:34] <+SWFanatic> hope its fixed before it goes live
[0:45:45] <%RealThiele> raid time

[0:46:04] <%Sotetsu> THE Pasta Rat???
[0:46:04] <FlashFrame> @Sotetsu voodoo doll would work well for that, or if they went for techno chucky [from the reboot] they could use Kaslan drones.
[0:46:06] <@PatStaresAt> Oh god damnit

[0:46:37] <mikeriffic> what do you think of him so far @PeachSaliva ?
[0:46:39] <AFlyingTaco1> Who's PastaRat? He sounds like a fuckin' NERD!
[0:46:45] <%freelancebabymaker> im still on the idea that chucky would need some kind of lowered version of hooks
[0:46:49] <+xerotwo> FamilyMan OOP AHH!
[0:46:49] <@MistyMntns> Ugh I love this map
[0:46:54] <williamrooster> psaDab psaDab psaDab
[0:46:56] <@Jekado> maybe focus looking for the box then?
[0:46:58] <Dementedpenguin> The ptb has been buggy all day. Earlier I saw a Pinhead bug out after getting hit by Head On
[0:47:00] <%Sotetsu> Pinhead looks so cool
[0:47:02] <%ospreyworks> just remember paige- you are big and strong and capable
[0:47:06] <%Agami23> whats the box do?
[0:47:08] <BlackStarAura> He has such sights to show you
[0:47:09] <FlashFrame> Paige, just a heads up, you can break the chains by using walls, treat them similar to Deathslinger's chains.
[0:47:16] <terrorengine> do you shoot lazers out of the box?
[0:47:16] <@MistyMntns> Oohhh I love the Box animation on the survivor
[0:47:18] <illTemperedSeaBass> Have you considered mercilessly pallete-looping and t-bagging when the killer gives up?
[0:47:23] <%freelancebabymaker> this game needs the bear from condemned
[0:47:25] <ergulor> the cube
[0:47:27] <GarbageQueenEllie> Destroy that box, Paige
[0:47:30] <%JaydenSai> The box lights up the closer you get. I've seen the box clear the bug of the infinite chains @PeachSaliva
[0:47:35] <T_Sasquatch> What's in the box ?????
[0:47:43] <benjiFG> with these bugs you get the pass
[0:47:44] <%Sotetsu> Solving the box is a death sentence.
[0:47:45] <%M3djedx> sipsipRude
[0:47:47] <@SoFarFetched> Paige would T-Bag me geefPlz
[0:47:48] <AFlyingTaco1> Paige is too pure
[0:47:49] <%Agami23> i've never seen the movie, so i find the box thing weird but cool
[0:47:54] <illTemperedSeaBass> Oh it most certainly is poor etiquette, but it's also mandatory DbD culture.
[0:47:54] <danteftw20> that's the reverse of how the movie box works
[0:47:54] <%Sotetsu> sipsipGasm
[0:47:55] <@Jekado> Paige confirms Tbags pat all the time!
[0:48:00] <%freelancebabymaker> the box has hooks in it
[0:48:02] <%freelancebabymaker> so many hooks
[0:48:05] <Meltgar> METAL BAWKES
[0:48:07] <BlackStarAura> Garak’s actor was in the first Hellraiser movie
[0:48:08] <terrorengine> its good stuff
[0:48:09] <AFlyingTaco1> It's a great movie
[0:48:11] <Dementedpenguin> @Agami23 the movie can be very graphic.
[0:48:15] <%RealThiele> jeez fast gen
[0:48:16] <%BinaryFireball> your first time watching it???
[0:48:18] <+Ynkubus_> Its great
[0:48:19] <CandyCoatedConfection> wait really? you guys hell raiser is a classic.
[0:48:21] <%Sotetsu> I hear 1 and 2 are good
[0:48:27] <AFlyingTaco1> The second one is fucking metal
[0:48:31] <@SoFarFetched> oh yeah the pallet got updated too
[0:48:35] <%Agami23> fuck i love practical effects, but im also a coward
[0:48:36] <%freelancebabymaker> hellraiser and hellraiser 2 are awesome
[0:48:40] <+Ynkubus_> 1, 2 and 3 are must watches
[0:48:43] <%wibbwobbler> WutFace
[0:48:46] <illTemperedSeaBass> Oh no. He's camping.
[0:48:50] <%freelancebabymaker> most of the sequels suck

[0:49:18] <+xerotwo> doodYelp
[0:49:19] <@SoFarFetched> phase camping
[0:49:20] <+realm_forge> The franchise is notorious for awakening kinks so ya know....have fun
[0:49:27] <Visorak6> So whats the new guy do
[0:49:35] <@SoFarFetched> chains excite him
[0:49:36] <@SoFarFetched> Kappa
[0:49:37] <%freelancebabymaker> @realm_forge what else could be awakened here
[0:49:38] <Meltgar> @Visorak6 Chain city
[0:49:38] <illTemperedSeaBass> Face-camping killer. You're legally allowed to t-bag, now. ArgieB8
[0:49:46] <Ghostbusttyler> @Visorak6 Chains
[0:49:50] <+Captain_Spicy_> RUB THE BUTT
[0:49:51] <AFlyingTaco1> You know I have to wonder if the Cenobites were inspired by the Godhand
[0:49:59] <%Agami23> at this point, i dont know if anything can awaken a new kink out of me.
[0:50:02] <%freelancebabymaker> eat ass to restore health
[0:50:11] <%radda343> heal people by giving them a good back rub
[0:50:12] <terrorengine> Hey, page, guess what the female Cenobites is name.
[0:50:16] <%graemecrackers2> Hellraiser was originally X-Rated
[0:50:19] <+realm_forge> @freelancebabymaker there’s always something else lol
[0:50:20] <+Ynkubus_> @AFlyingTaco1 other way around
[0:50:21] <topiodonk> i have never seen hellraiser but i have read a crossover harry potter fanfic and it was very silly
[0:50:33] <hearingthenseeing> where pat at? bed?
[0:50:37] <+SciFiBrony> What do the generators even do?
[0:50:45] <+xerotwo> It kinda sucks that the Stranger Things dlc is gonna be removed from this game
[0:50:52] <benjiFG> i like things sometimes
[0:50:58] <%freelancebabymaker> @PeachSaliva yknow they originally wanted to call the first hellraiser "sadomasochists from beyond the grave"
[0:50:58] <%RealThiele> he died
[0:51:00] <illTemperedSeaBass> I love the Thing! In fact, he's my favorite of the Fantastic Four! BrokeBack
[0:51:10] <@SoFarFetched> @AFlyingTaco1 well the original hellraiser book came out in 1986 while Berserk came out in Japan in 1989
[0:51:11] <%FallenAngelZelos> FallenAngelZelos extended their Tier 1 subscription through September! 
[0:51:15] <@MistyMntns> Camping
[0:51:17] <@MistyMntns> Asshole
[0:51:17] <+InternetShis> He's downstairs swimming in all that pasta sauce
[0:51:21] <%mckraven> pat has been gone for 5 years
[0:51:27] <illTemperedSeaBass> F.
[0:51:34] <+Anime_Flux> this guy sucks
[0:51:37] <%isolex_> Imagine facecamping on the PTB
[0:51:40] <FlashFrame> that white aura is the box.
[0:51:41] <+realm_forge> Pat is somewhere in the house shoveling fistfuls of cake into his face
[0:51:42] <+whyskeywolfe> What a butt!
[0:51:48] <Dementedpenguin> Camping in the ptb. NotLikeThis
[0:51:50] <@MistyMntns> @isolex_ Imagine Facecamping period.
[0:51:53] <AFlyingTaco1> @Ynkubus_  @SoFarFetched I didn't know Berserk came out after Hellraiser, that's cool
[0:51:54] <%radda343> I think that white aura thing is the cube
[0:51:59] <%cade_calrayn> Plot twist: Pat is actually just Zangief's V-Tuber avatar
[0:52:02] <benjiFG> That player has a great name
[0:52:05] <FlashFrame> Yeah the white aura in the distance is the puzzle box.
[0:52:08] <illTemperedSeaBass> The door doesn't open on 5 gens. They spawn on 5 gens, allowing you to pull a lever for 20 seconds which does open the door.
[0:52:08] <ChaoticArsonist_> Such a mean Pinhead
[0:52:15] <%radda343> he found it
[0:52:17] <%isolex_> @isolex_ Truth, but on the ptb its even more egregious
[0:52:32] <@MistyMntns> Its because people who dont play killer, play killer in the PTB
[0:52:33] <Decarcassor> Annnd its already over
[0:52:37] <FlashFrame> okay so now you're under a chain hunt, someone NEEDS to solve the box.
[0:52:42] <Decarcassor> That chain stuff is kind of underwhelming
[0:52:45] <@SoFarFetched> think its more people don't care if its PTB,they'll still camp
[0:52:45] <+kaaaazi> which perks are you running
[0:52:53] <+konigiv> I think the chain bug only happens when the chain collides with a wall or something
[0:52:54] <@SoFarFetched> they tend to still have the same playstyle they have in the live server
[0:52:56] <Ghostbusttyler> Meg just did the box
[0:52:56] <FlashFrame> it's the white aura
[0:53:00] <Prism_Wing> it has a white aura
[0:53:04] <%radda343> they did that's why the chains stopped
[0:53:13] <%radda343> it respawns at a random place once solved
[0:53:14] <terrorengine> the box is in morrocco
[0:53:15] <+kaaaazi> thank you!!!
[0:53:17] <FlashFrame> when you hear the church bells, it's back on the map.
[0:53:25] <%freelancebabymaker> whats youre pleasure sir?
[0:53:29] <FastmanJones> You should be able to see the boxs aura when its available
[0:53:30] <%Sotetsu> You can see the box's aura. It is boxes shaped.
[0:53:41] <keeenny907> Why did you choose those perks?
[0:53:53] <FlashFrame> you're on point.
[0:54:06] <ChaoticArsonist_> Tip for finding gens on this map, look for flickering lights or exit signs and a gen should be nearby
[0:54:09] <%freelancebabymaker> @PeachSaliva yknow they originally wanted to call the first hellraiser "sadomasochists from beyond the grave"
[0:54:11] <tanarath> What's solving the box do?
[0:54:13] <+kaaaazi> Do you use window of opportunity often?
[0:54:18] <%Sotetsu> You can steal the box when you leave got extra points.
[0:54:28] <President_Pariah> there's no incentive to solve the box, if you just carry it you hold Pinhead's passive hostage indefinitely, apparently
[0:54:31] <@SoFarFetched> then BAM, NOED check
[0:54:40] <%radda343> the white thing is the box
[0:54:50] <FlashFrame> it removes the "Curse"
[0:54:52] <tanarath> run
[0:54:55] <%freelancebabymaker> ohhh the music
[0:55:03] <MiamiMemory> YOU SOLVED THE BOX
[0:55:11] <%Sotetsu> He came
[0:55:13] <@PlagueOfGripes> paige wants into the sex pain cave
[0:55:18] <%JaydenSai> Hi Plague
[0:55:21] <President_Pariah> if you're solving the box Pinhead can destroy it to teleportto you
[0:55:21] <terrorengine> bummer
[0:55:24] <@SoFarFetched> well theres the noed check
[0:55:26] <FlashFrame> you also cannot drop the box, once you pick it up unless you solve it, and you won't drop it if the killer has Franklins.
[0:55:27] <@SoFarFetched> no NOED
[0:55:34] <+xerotwo> BYE NERD LUL
[0:55:35] <terrorengine> nice
[0:55:36] <@SoFarFetched> no no he didnt
[0:55:37] <@SoFarFetched> LUL
[0:55:45] <+xerotwo> LUL
[0:55:47] <@SoFarFetched> Im saying the NOED check happened and there was no NOED
[0:55:49] <%freelancebabymaker> but she already has one
[0:55:53] <@PlagueOfGripes> that's what the cube DOES
[0:55:55] <%freelancebabymaker> thats where pat lives
[0:55:57] <@SoFarFetched> well you at least escaped
[0:55:57] <Prism_Wing> zero kills even with camping lol
[0:56:04] <%JaydenSai> The cave is full of pasta sauce right now
[0:56:09] <@PlagueOfGripes> what the hell are these roman numerals
[0:56:10] <Dementedpenguin> >_>
[0:56:15] <AFlyingTaco1> Is the sex pain cave like the Party Cave from Bloodborne?
[0:56:17] <@SoFarFetched> @PlagueOfGripes new ranking system
[0:56:17] <ergulor> your avatar protected us from the curses
[0:56:23] <+Commander_Cruz> This vrchat update is crazy chilledPOGGERS
[0:56:25] <+realm_forge> I’d go to a club called the sex pain cave

[0:56:31] <%cade_calrayn> she's gonna orgder.... WcDonalds?
[0:56:33] <%superc37> @PeachSaliva did you see the leak that pinhead might be getting a genderswapped skin?
[0:56:36] <+InternetShis> SHEESH
[0:56:36] <FlashFrame> They're showing off stuff for the new ranking system yeah.
[0:56:41] <Prism_Wing> @aflyingtaco1 It's a competitor Kappa
[0:56:42] <%medoodoo> what the hell is a sex pain cave?
[0:56:44] <FlashFrame> it's not implimented yet though.
[0:56:47] <$rdark_ksu> you should order Falafel
[0:56:47] <@SoFarFetched> Paige you should order food quick
[0:56:50] <CandyCoatedConfection> borrowed time
[0:56:52] <@PlagueOfGripes> I played two matches today but nervous system started acting up
[0:56:53] <@SoFarFetched> while you're loading in
[0:56:59] <CandyCoatedConfection> it's always good.
[0:56:59] <%radda343> lithe + dance with me is legit
[0:56:59] <%Sotetsu> @medoodoo Exactly what it sounds like fmgNICE
[0:57:03] <illTemperedSeaBass> I heard No Mither is a good one. Kappa
[0:57:14] <illTemperedSeaBass> No it isn't.
[0:57:16] <illTemperedSeaBass> That was a joke.
[0:57:18] <%medoodoo> @Sotetsu WHAT?
[0:57:18] <illTemperedSeaBass> Don't use it.
[0:57:20] <@PlagueOfGripes> no mither is not
[0:57:21] <topiodonk> female cenobite looks cool
[0:57:22] <@SoFarFetched> But you dont keep the blood paige
[0:57:24] <@SoFarFetched> LUL its PTB
[0:57:26] <%superc37> no its not paige thts a meme
[0:57:28] <%king_wragles> Paige, it's PTB
[0:57:29] <@PlagueOfGripes> PTB paige
[0:57:34] <tanarath> christmas cake
[0:57:36] <@SoFarFetched> Blood you earn in PTB does not carry over into Live.
[0:57:37] <ManfredA> it's David's perk
[0:57:37] <illTemperedSeaBass> No Mither is you're always injured.
[0:57:41] <@PlagueOfGripes> no mither is the one where you're always half dead
[0:57:42] <illTemperedSeaBass> But quiet.
[0:57:45] <CandyCoatedConfection> it's the one where you stay injured
[0:57:47] <illTemperedSeaBass> And can pick yourself up when downed.
[0:57:48] <CrimsonFox777> Jebaited
[0:57:48] <%radda343> the one where you spend the whole trial injured
[0:57:51] <FlashFrame> you start injured, and can't heal.
[0:57:53] <%king_wragles> But very silent, no bleeding
[0:58:07] <%superc37> we dont
[0:58:14] <robotoken> no one does paige
[0:58:16] <%JaydenSai> Thats not why we're here Paige
[0:58:41] <@PlagueOfGripes> also the game was insanely laggy tonight
[0:58:43] <%Damien_Kova> Damien_Kova subscribed with Prime. 
[0:58:49] <%radda343> fyi he can teleport to you while you solve the box
[0:58:49] <ChaoticArsonist_> If you want good DbD tips, go to Otzdarva
[0:58:52] <alliedmastercompy> I would rather you have fun, than be a fountain of knowledge. Play to your strengths @PeachSaliva, you are a fun, entertaining person.
[0:58:52] <%altwaal05> altwaal05 subscribed with Prime. They've subscribed for 4 months, currently on a 2 month streak! Four months and no regrets!!
[0:58:53] <illTemperedSeaBass> I already watch a different streamer for DbD try-harding. God it looks so exhausting.
[0:58:55] <KnightOfTrousers> THE GAMER CUBE?!?!?!
[0:59:03] <%medoodoo> oh please paige please dont go that far
[0:59:05] <%JaydenSai> Yes Paige give us your hot tip
[0:59:06] <ManfredA> while you're solving it
[0:59:09] <mr_saturday93> pure?
[0:59:10] <%JaydenSai> By all means
[0:59:13] <@PlagueOfGripes> what benefit is there to solving the cube
[0:59:14] <%freelancebabymaker> the box
[0:59:22] <@Jekado> When are we getting a Paige esque highlight real like Otz has
[0:59:25] <%graemecrackers2> oh my
[0:59:25] <BlackStarAura> Shadow puzzle box
[0:59:26] <President_Pariah> Pinhead teleporting to you has the same effect as solving the box
[0:59:31] <+democrazyyy> if you dont solve cube and the meter fills this happens
[0:59:36] <emper0rner0> @PlagueOfGripes No more passive chains stunning and slowing you
[0:59:37] <%JaydenSai> @PlagueOfGripes It stops the chains from spawning and bothering you when the gauge fills
[0:59:37] <%JoshManVGH> Gooddamn why is a daylight map spooking me more than the dark decrepit ones?
[0:59:38] <President_Pariah> it resets Pinhead's passive power
[0:59:39] <+glgzephyr> what a great mechanic....
[0:59:45] <@PlagueOfGripes> ah.
[0:59:47] <da_ji1> Omg last time I played DBD this map was so low quality. Were all the maps revamped cause they look fuckin awesome now
[0:59:48] <%radda343> @PlagueOfGripes it stops him from finding it and starting the chain spawns
[0:59:48] <@PlagueOfGripes> it looks annoying
[0:59:51] <+InternetShis> That needs a tunin
[0:59:56] <Decarcassor> @PlagueOfGripes There is some kind of chain meter, whdere chain start to attack survivors passevely. Solving the box stop that.
[0:59:57] <%JaydenSai> @PlagueOfGripes It is!
[1:00:09] <+democrazyyy> everybody gets constantly attacked by chains for a few sec, while someone is solving it he can teleport right to them as well
[1:00:11] <danteftw20> have you considered colabing with Melody? I heard she's a big fan of your voice acting in plague's animations
[1:00:18] <scrumbotime> paige is Sneaky
[1:00:18] <%freelancebabymaker> lol
[1:00:21] <mikeriffic> what was the plan paige!
[1:00:27] <Vermillion129> Oh. hey Paige, thank you pat for sending the chat here
[1:00:29] <+democrazyyy> hold m1 for those
[1:00:31] <+DescendantDroog> gotta hold the button
[1:00:36] <@PlagueOfGripes> solve the cube of lust or face the chains of bare bottom spankings
[1:00:37] <%graemecrackers2> Pinhead is 6 foot 5 inches
[1:00:43] <%Drowsy_Tuna> hi Paige and chat sipsipDab sipsipDab
[1:00:45] <mikeriffic> oh ya
[1:00:46] <%freelancebabymaker> the bug seems to happen whenever you go thru stuff while the hooks have you?
[1:00:46] <hearingthenseeing> The ride never ends
[1:00:48] <%rivercitydemon> Not again SilverCry
[1:00:49] <Decarcassor> But since the box is super easy to find, survivors keep fucking with it and the passive chain power almost never activate. :/
[1:00:59] <Dunmarkh> beautiful, incredible, stunning and brave
[1:01:00] <FlashFrame> Paige has the worst luck with this bug.
[1:01:01] <+CalderGaming> that's the sound of the bugs, working on the chaaaaaains
[1:01:01] <scrumbotime> Eli, I thought you solved the cube of lust AND got bare bottom spankings?
[1:01:02] <@Jekado> can't even run is weird
[1:01:03] <AFlyingTaco1> @PlagueOfGripes But then no one would want to solve the cube
[1:01:07] <+konigiv> the bug happens when the chains collide with a wall or something
[1:01:16] <+xerotwo> LUL
[1:01:18] <baka_sugoi> poop
[1:01:18] <%JimmyRuss> Is that three out of four games?
[1:01:24] <%polothegreatest> LUL LUL
[1:01:24] <+SimplesRock> 3 for 3
[1:01:26] <%TheWinged7> your character in game does too Kappa
[1:01:26] <+InternetShis> NEED... FIBER...
[1:01:28] <scrumbotime> You tellin' me if I want to play with a funny puzzle cube the BDSM demons LEAVE???
[1:01:28] <%freelancebabymaker> oh no ive made a new hole
[1:01:34] <draca23> Just give them your corpse uncle to spare you.
[1:01:37] <%JaydenSai> She needs more fiber in her diet
[1:01:52] <ManfredA> in the lore solving the box is what summons the cenobites
[1:01:55] <ManfredA> so it's a little funny
[1:01:58] <+ForgottenVoidCast> I come into the stream and see this first. I love bugs.
[1:02:03] <terrorengine> is he that tall in the movie?
[1:02:10] <President_Pariah> the red rank survivors have just been grabbing the box, tapping it to bait Pinhead into teleporting so they can make him 'Come'

[1:02:44] <Decarcassor> Pinorb

[1:03:16] <@SoFarFetched> Zarinna
[1:03:16] <scrumbotime> Paige enjoys many condom mints
[1:03:17] <FlashFrame> the original actor for Pinhead is 5'11"
[1:03:19] <@PlagueOfGripes> oh who is the new survivor
[1:03:20] <@SoFarFetched> That's Zarinna
[1:03:25] <%rivercitydemon> Zarina
[1:03:26] <FlashFrame> Zirana.
[1:03:27] <@SoFarFetched> No new survivoe Plague
[1:03:29] <President_Pariah> there isn't a new survivor
[1:03:30] <+DescendantDroog> the greek collection for zarina
[1:03:30] <@SoFarFetched> survivor*
[1:03:31] <@SoFarFetched> its just killer
[1:03:32] <+Load_Complete> Does kate normally moan that often? when on the hook? goddamn
[1:03:34] <Prism_Wing> lol
[1:03:40] <President_Pariah> and there's no new map either

[1:03:48] <%JaydenSai> All I know is Pinhead loves to come to his box
[1:03:50] <@PlagueOfGripes> who came with pinhead
[1:03:53] <+Rolandknight> YAY bugs
[1:03:55] <terrorengine> lol
[1:03:57] <@SoFarFetched> @PlagueOfGripes just Pinhead
[1:04:02] <%freelancebabymaker> free to DIE
[1:04:07] <+glgzephyr> oh my god I hate this
[1:04:07] <hearingthenseeing> there is no escape
[1:04:11] <@PlagueOfGripes> JUST pinhead? that's weird
[1:04:13] <%JaydenSai> @PlagueOfGripes Just Pinhead, the original actress had licensing issues
[1:04:13] <+Load_Complete> they're calling this a paragraph not a chapter so no survivor.
[1:04:13] <@Jekado> only pinhead CAME
[1:04:15] <+NopeBadguy> Who ya callin' "Pinhead"?
[1:04:16] <+GuilKato> wiggle wiggle wiggle
[1:04:17] <%rivercitydemon> One of the survivors is a wrestling fan by the name
[1:04:17] <%Ozavic> We're 3/3 tonight y'all, this seems like it needs more time in the oven
[1:04:18] <+NopeBadguy> I wanna be Dirty Dan
[1:04:21] <Prism_Wing> WE came with Pinhead
[1:04:23] <illTemperedSeaBass> NOEC. No One Escapes Chains. Broken perk, plz nerf.
[1:04:24] <FlashFrame> it's another "paragraph" chapter. no survivor or map, just killer.
[1:04:29] <@SoFarFetched> @PlagueOfGripes believe they did it before with Ghostface. I think they mentioned awhile back the next killer and survivor would be seperate.
[1:04:29] <FlashFrame> similar to Leatherface.
[1:04:39] <+NopeBadguy> Can't believe they added Pinhead Larry and not Dirty Dan
[1:04:40] <+Ynkubus_> It would have been cool if they had Hell/Labyrinth for the map
[1:04:41] <@SoFarFetched> yeah and leatherface was his own
[1:04:46] <KnightOfTrousers> These movies are before my time but I should look them up
[1:04:49] <@PlagueOfGripes> what if they added a survivor from a license but no killer
[1:04:54] <Broand> I'm dirty dan
[1:04:55] <ChaoticArsonist_> FINALLY! The Killer-Survivor count is even, I think
[1:04:55] <+NopeBadguy> @PeachSaliva It's a Spongebob Reference
[1:04:56] <illTemperedSeaBass> I'm Dirty Dan. :)
[1:04:58] <@PlagueOfGripes> heh
[1:04:58] <quinndan> not even a map?
[1:04:59] <draca23> Spongebob
[1:05:00] <%JaydenSai> Hah
[1:05:01] <%Zeif00> Apparently we might be getting a new surivor after this
[1:05:01] <sydowoodo> I'm dirty dan
[1:05:01] <%JaydenSai> Gottem
[1:05:03] <Mister_McDerp> I'M DIRTY DAN
[1:05:03] <CrimsonFox777> No, I'm Dirty Dan
[1:05:03] <FlashFrame> @PlagueOfGripes  they did with Ash Williams.
[1:05:04] <+FoolsArcade> They did that already
[1:05:04] <hearingthenseeing> I'M dirty dan
[1:05:05] <danteftw20> I"M DIRTY DAN!!
[1:05:05] <mikeriffic> i mean, Ash
[1:05:05] <AFlyingTaco1> It's Spongebob reference lol
[1:05:05] <$Weeabooninja> Dirty Dan is Spongebob
[1:05:06] <+FoolsArcade> Ash Williams
[1:05:06] <%freelancebabymaker> i feel like any map for hellraiser would be annoying
[1:05:07] <%Ozavic> Ash kinda
[1:05:07] <terrorengine> that sounds bad
[1:05:08] <Prism_Wing> That was Bill
[1:05:09] <ManfredA> @KnightOfTrousers The first film is great but very gory
[1:05:10] <+razielhex> SUCH SIGHTS
[1:05:10] <%TECHNO_OUTLAW> I'm Dirty Dan
[1:05:11] <@PlagueOfGripes> I'M Dirty Dan
[1:05:12] <+xmetalicdemonx> ash williams
[1:05:13] <+rrratbastard> wasnt evil dead that
[1:05:13] <@SoFarFetched> They did do that with Ash and Bill.
[1:05:14] <greenoni> No, I'm Dirty Dan.
[1:05:14] <+DescendantDroog> they did that with Ash and Bill
[1:05:15] <CandyCoatedConfection> weird that they basically made pinhead a beside chapter.
[1:05:15] <@Jekado> Ash has no killer.
[1:05:17] <+NopeBadguy> I'm Dirty Dan
[1:05:24] <FlashFrame> Evil Dead chapter was just Ash, no killer or map.
[1:05:24] <marrowjuice> I'm Dirty Dan
[1:05:24] <CandyCoatedConfection> *b-side
[1:05:26] <LysdexicAndVolingit> No I'm dirty dan!
[1:05:31] <terrorengine> you know, that show that came out 2 decades ago
[1:05:31] <%JoshManVGH> Here is Jennifer Aneston from Leperchaun. You kids go have fun.
[1:05:33] <mr_saturday93> no childhood lol
[1:05:34] <@PlagueOfGripes> who you callin pinhead?
[1:05:45] <+NopeBadguy> Which one of you is the REAL Dirty Dan
[1:05:50] <+razielhex> Cenobite's name is just Hell Priest
[1:05:51] <@SoFarFetched> yeah and we only had Bill from Left 4 Dead
[1:05:56] <+Load_Complete> They can't do leprechuan cause of his size so get jennifer aniston's character
[1:05:57] <FlashFrame> And bill yeah.
[1:06:03] <%Zeif00> Ghostface was also their own Paragraph too
[1:06:04] <%freelancebabymaker> the map for hellraiser would either be the house from 1 or MAYBE the labyrinth from 2 but both of those sound like a pain in the ass
[1:06:07] <FrankBlarghHonk> Huh, I stop playing DBD for a week and I come across this as the first time I hear that Pinhead is in the game now.
[1:06:09] <FlashFrame> but we got cosmetics for other L4D characters for the main survivors.
[1:06:11] <+democrazyyy> must be actively trtying to solve cube
[1:06:14] <Decarcassor> We also had 2 chapter with 2 survivors
[1:06:16] <Parapattern> Alright, Pin Head, now you get yours!
[1:06:17] <ManfredA> he can teleport when someone uses the box, and when he uses his power he basically puts down a portal that he can shoot a chain from
[1:06:22] <@SoFarFetched> @FrankBlarghHonk yeah he JUST came out on the PTB today
[1:06:24] <%DoctorWrenchcoat> He can teleport to a survivor solving the box.
[1:06:25] <%JaydenSai> Whose left in classic horror villains you want them to try and get Paige? @PeachSaliva I know you want Chucky but anyone else?
[1:06:27] <ChaoticArsonist_> Evil Devs not giving us Springtrap
[1:06:32] <@PlagueOfGripes> have you encountered PTB Clown yet?
[1:06:35] <%JoshManVGH> Someone has to complete the Lament Configuration in order to open the door.
[1:06:36] <+razielhex> in the 2nd Hellraiser book when he fights against Harry D'amor (from Lord of Illusions and Books of Blood) the Hellpriest just starts trying to kill Satan
[1:06:42] <+Blargimazombie> Dude screw Springtrap
[1:06:47] <@SoFarFetched> The more people ask for SpringTrap,the more Behavior pushes it away Kappa
[1:06:47] <+democrazyyy> he can spy with that portal too without shooitng
[1:06:50] <%radda343> that's an alright killer perk
[1:06:51] <%freelancebabymaker> @JaydenSai i mean they kinda got all the classics
[1:06:59] <ManfredA> he came
[1:07:00] <LoneFonte> he CAME
[1:07:01] <+Load_Complete> he's also got the new perk
[1:07:04] <ergulor> what did he say?
[1:07:05] <%CantWalkGood> Apparently after the original name ideas for the movie were turned down, they started asking the production crew for names. A 60 year old woman in costumes said "What  a Woman Would do for a Good +×$@"
[1:07:06] <Dunmarkh> show box
[1:07:11] <+NopeBadguy> As someone who hasn't played eitehr game in a while, is Deathgarden still active or has it just been abandoned for DBD?
[1:07:14] <ManfredA> yes and it goes through walls/floors
[1:07:18] <BaronVonProlix> who did they get to voice Pinhead? that sounded suspiciously like Wayne June
[1:07:20] <@SoFarFetched> @NopeBadguy its been gone for YEARS
[1:07:33] <+Load_Complete> oh that's neat. I didn't know he only says the "I came" part to the person he teleports to
[1:07:35] <+NopeBadguy> @SoFarFetched Oh, F. I actually remember liking that gam
[1:07:43] <%freelancebabymaker> @PeachSaliva yknow they originally wanted to call the first hellraiser "sadomasochists from beyond the grave"
[1:07:52] <FlashFrame> so that sound is the box reappearing on the map
[1:07:57] <illTemperedSeaBass> @NopeBadguy Is Death Garden DbD but with Titanfall mobility? That game has an anti-pulse at this point. Deader than dead.
[1:08:02] <+razielhex> @freelancebabymaker super weird, because Clive Barker named it "The Hellbound Heart"
[1:08:02] <%radda343> those chimes almost sound like the bingbong man
[1:08:11] <ManfredA> he seems like an annoying killer for people who haven't mastered him but nightmarish when people do
[1:08:14] <+NopeBadguy> Man, that sucks
[1:08:19] <@SoFarFetched> yeah that was the book title
[1:08:19] <%JaydenSai> @radda343 Chime means the box has respawned
[1:08:23] <@SoFarFetched> they're probably at the other exit gate
[1:08:27] <%freelancebabymaker> thats also the name of the book
[1:08:28] <Decarcassor> Deathgarden was an unwatchable mess.
[1:08:28] <+razielhex> Yeah, it's a short story.  It's got a lot more semen in the story but the movie follows it pretty closely.
[1:08:30] <KnightOfTrousers> I once read a comic where a girl with an abusive stepfather kept praying to jesus to save her. Then she found the puzzle box. "Jese sent them." And they fucked up the stepdad Cheer500
[1:08:41] <%rivercitydemon> GG nyannPOG nyannPOG nyannPOG
[1:08:45] <ChaoticArsonist_> Do the box in the mean time
[1:09:03] <@SoFarFetched> Jesse Jesus of course
[1:09:03] <@SoFarFetched> Kappa
[1:09:06] <FlashFrame> Jesus
[1:09:07] <@SoFarFetched> the new religion
[1:09:10] <Mister_McDerp> praise jesse
[1:09:12] <+NateyBeak> so close to THE BEST LEVEL
[1:09:16] <CrimsonFox777> Our Lord and Savior, Jese Christ.
[1:09:17] <+CandideCamera> Jesse Crist
[1:09:19] <%freelancebabymaker> well...demons to some angels to others yknow?
[1:09:20] <FlashFrame> "Angels to some, Demons to others"
[1:09:20] <%CantWalkGood> @razielhex they turned it down because it sounded like a romance novel, so he gave them the second name and the producers thought it was to sexual
[1:09:22] <Prism_Wing> lol
[1:09:22] <CandyCoatedConfection> LUL
[1:09:25] <Jaysky> Oh dang
[1:09:26] <KnightOfTrousers> Jesse Christ lol
[1:09:27] <illTemperedSeaBass> Can you spare a minute for Jesse Christ our lord and savior?
[1:09:29] <+razielhex> @KnightOfTrousers Yeah, the Hellraiser comics definitely have a different characterization of the cenobites; they don't harm children, but they go after people who do if children accidently solve the Lamentation Configuration.
[1:09:31] <+glgzephyr> I think you mean JoJo
[1:09:31] <phantomsleeves> does anyone know what bronze rank would be in the old ranking system?
[1:09:32] <Mattais88> JJ Style
[1:09:33] <+Thesaltt> JJJ?!  I want my pictures of Spiderman!
[1:09:33] <vulpuspictus> Jesus was the original jostar
[1:09:34] <+GuilKato> Jesus wants photos of spiderman!
[1:09:34] <ChrisPlaysThing> J J H christ
[1:09:35] <%TECHNO_OUTLAW> can this fox lady even read
[1:09:36] <BlackStarAura> Uncle Jesse
[1:09:37] <majorpeppy> Jojo Jesus
[1:09:38] <emper0rner0> Oh shit is that a JOJO reference??
[1:09:39] <Jaysky> Yo Jesus hear me out!
[1:09:40] <%MarylandJutsu> JJ PAIGE IM
[1:09:42] <illTemperedSeaBass> This mothafucka need JESSE!
[1:09:45] <ChaoticArsonist_> Do you wanna talk about our Lord and saviour Jesse Christ?
[1:09:58] <KnightOfTrousers> Jesseeeeee the Christ!
[1:09:59] <hearingthenseeing> Jesus, James, and Meowth, that's right!
[1:10:00] <%rivercitydemon> Yep
[1:10:00] <ergulor> yes
[1:10:00] <Dementedpenguin> What did Jesse die for?
[1:10:00] <%SveriSageAdvice> that eldritch nightmare? yeah
[1:10:01] <danteftw20> the only way to get into heaven is PHOTOS, PHOTOS OF SPIDERMAN!
[1:10:03] <+pkmamsters> Jayjay always scared me
[1:10:06] <%MarylandJutsu> those faces on those planes scared me
[1:10:07] <+xerotwo> Oh god Jay Jay
[1:10:08] <+pkmamsters> because i didn't like the CG
[1:10:10] <AFlyingTaco1> Just barely. I remember the jingle.
[1:10:11] <LoneFonte> sadly yes
[1:10:11] <+GuilKato> Jay Jonah Jameson - he wants photos of spiderman now
[1:10:11] <+rancherobill> that shit was cursed looking
[1:10:13] <%maskofmichael> JJ Christ: I WANT PICTURES OF SPIDER-SATAN!
[1:10:13] <%GabiTheMermaid> He had a wrinkly face
[1:10:13] <%zeroarturia> I do
[1:10:16] <+realm_forge> Y’all bitches need Jessie
[1:10:18] <+xerotwo> It's got the creepy faces
[1:10:19] <+democrazyyy> that was my childhood
[1:10:22] <+SciFiBrony> I just now remembered
[1:10:26] <+razielhex> those shorts are amazing
[1:10:28] <%SveriSageAdvice> its because they made the faces too human
[1:10:29] <+democrazyyy> the propellers were mustaches
[1:10:32] <%doomunderthestairs> yep yep
[1:10:35] <@SoFarFetched> @phantomsleeves I assume it reflects what you were prior, so Im guessing green for Bronze.
[1:10:37] <KnightOfTrousers> "Lets hold up a massive airliner full of cargo, low on fuel for the sake of a baby tree on the runway"
[1:10:40] <%SveriSageAdvice> with that generation of 3d Animation, human faces are nightmarish
[1:10:40] <Mattais88> Must hate those Cars spinoffs then...
[1:10:40] <%GabiTheMermaid> You’re right it hits different
[1:10:42] <FrankBlarghHonk> I remember the one episode where they basically say fuck off to the moon and the man on the moon gets depressed.
[1:10:46] <ChaoticArsonist_> Thomas the tank engine is the best
[1:10:52] <anAngryHamster> Thomas had Ringo Starr and George Carlin, can't  top that
[1:10:53] <%doomunderthestairs> with more realistic faces
[1:10:56] <+SciFiBrony> Part of it was that those planes, like, they had articulated bending bodies and wings
[1:10:57] <$TheNewZealandStory> pinhead is so cool
[1:11:05] <FastmanJones> JJ the Jetplane for DBD
[1:11:05] <+razielhex> so when you're on the test server, do your live consumables not get consumes?
[1:11:06] <reddpop_> CHOEZ
[1:11:10] <%GabiTheMermaid> those planes were too rounded, thomas had corners so you could still tell it was a machine
[1:11:18] <ManfredA> I wanna see the add on he has where he gives people deep wound with his chains
[1:11:19] <+realm_forge> The meatcanyon Thomas the Tank engine animation is brilliant
[1:11:20] <illTemperedSeaBass> ... What the hell are you boomers talking about?
[1:11:20] <%JaydenSai> Like some sort of Rat?
[1:11:21] <Broand> I know a couple who does that, it DOES rule
[1:11:23] <@SoFarFetched> @razielhex whatever you spent in the PTB does not effect live server
[1:11:27] <%JaydenSai> A rat who likes Pasta?
[1:11:31] <ChaoticArsonist_> His cheese and all them holes
[1:11:32] <%JaydenSai> A..Pasta Rat?
[1:11:40] <@SoFarFetched> So like any bloodpoints you earn in PTB does not carry over to the live server.
[1:11:42] <AFlyingTaco1> Da YOUFS
[1:11:42] <cureneckbeard> But Paige, there are no skeletons on the moon. Just tall night-time
[1:11:46] <+razielhex> OOOH WATCH HOW HE GLIDES
[1:11:48] <%pokefan9956> so pat is pasta rat. but what kind of pasta
[1:11:48] <+razielhex> that's so good
[1:11:50] <ManfredA> yes
[1:11:51] <FlashFrame> no, the PTB takes a snapshot from your account a few weeks back and uses that data, nothing you use in the PTB is used on your live account.
[1:11:52] <ManfredA> he can do that
[1:12:05] <+razielhex> JESUS WEPT
[1:12:11] <Prism_Wing> LUL
[1:12:13] <@SoFarFetched> excuse you
[1:12:18] <%JaydenSai> OPENED THE BOX
[1:12:19] <ChaoticArsonist_> What if they added Slenderman to DbD?
[1:12:19] <%Spydurman> JESSE WEPT
[1:12:20] <@SoFarFetched> you mean Jesse jesus wept
[1:12:20] <%JaydenSai> I CAME
[1:12:22] <BaronVonProlix> enough with the tears...its a waste of perfectly good suffering
[1:12:22] <%freelancebabymaker> JESUS WEPT
[1:12:23] <%MarylandJutsu> JEHEESUS
[1:12:24] <@SoFarFetched> JESSE JESUS
[1:12:30] <%freelancebabymaker> CAUSE HES A FREAK
[1:12:33] <BaronVonProlix> its a british saying IIRC
[1:12:35] <FlashFrame> because it's a blasphme.
[1:12:35] <%MarylandJutsu> @PeachSaliva bible verse
[1:12:36] <Mister_McDerp> jesse wept BibleThump
[1:12:38] <%freelancebabymaker> HES A SEXUAL FREAK
[1:12:38] <+NopeBadguy> JEESAS
[1:12:38] <hearingthenseeing> Jesse wept
[1:12:39] <$vile_brand> if i remember right he went off script
[1:12:39] <ManfredA> his power can be set down through walls, sorta like Nurse's blink
[1:12:41] <FrankBlarghHonk> I GET TORN APART!?!
[1:12:42] <Prism_Wing> Jesse Pinkman wept
[1:12:43] <%JaydenSai> Its a bible verse, I think?
[1:12:47] <+glgzephyr> it's just an edgy bible verse
[1:12:47] <cureneckbeard> bible
[1:12:48] <%Ranryu692> the words "Jesus wept' make me think of Community
[1:12:50] <+Demerson13> Andrew Robinson improvised that line
[1:12:51] <kayamek> Jesse Jesus Jonah Jameson
[1:12:52] <CrimsonFox777> BRITISH DansGame
[1:12:52] <weapon000> But Paige, he has such sights to show you.
[1:12:56] <+wizard_of_diamonds> It's a reference to the idea that Jesus is watching him become a perv
[1:12:57] <BaronVonProlix> Jeremy Clarkson says it all the time, either that or hes a big hellraiser fan
[1:12:58] <%rumtumtugnutz> Its the shortest verse in the bible.
[1:12:59] <vulpuspictus> It means "for fuck sake"
[1:12:59] <cureneckbeard> It's the shortest sentence in the New Testament
[1:13:00] <%graemecrackers2> that's how he dabs on the haters
[1:13:00] <ManfredA> Jesus Wept is sorta famous as the shortest bible verse
[1:13:02] <Broand> That's the shortest... verse I think, In the bible
[1:13:04] <%bevyrage> reminds me of 'chaos reigns' from the movie 'Antichrist'
[1:13:04] <emper0rner0> Is that what that Community joke is referencing?? I never realized
[1:13:04] <+Tornix> classic commercial
[1:13:09] <%Ranryu692> @PeachSaliva is that Mr Bucket song from something, or did you come up with it?
[1:13:16] <%BinaryFireball> mr.bucket or scary bilbo porn? which is scarier?
[1:13:19] <+Tornix> it's from a kids toy
[1:13:21] <%Ell1ot> wait... i thought you put them in his head and he spits them out his mouth
[1:13:22] <%JaydenSai> @Ranryu692 It was an actual childrens toy in the 90's
[1:13:22] <%rumtumtugnutz> "Jesus wept" is the shortest verse in the bible
[1:13:23] <BaronVonProlix> we all wish
[1:13:24] <ChaoticArsonist_> THE GODS LEFT US LONG AGO, all we have is their stories to tell of their power
[1:13:31] <%MarylandJutsu> its the shortest bible vese in existence

[1:24:20] <%Agami23> i wish they would add nicholas cage as a survivor
[1:24:25] <%TheWinged7> and thats why were all here
[1:24:32] <illTemperedSeaBass> What anime is the "People die when they are killed" thing from again?
[1:24:34] <$TheNewZealandStory> @SveriSageAdvice it may as well be, its so ugly
[1:24:39] <%freelancebabymaker> ghost rider lol
[1:24:39] <ManfredA> from the Wicker Man or from Mandy
[1:24:41] <vulpuspictus> cage should be a killer
[1:24:42] <@Jekado> Nicolas Cage should be a killer.
[1:24:47] <%MarylandJutsu> How'd it GET BURNED
[1:24:47] <%NeonLight> @illTemperedSeaBass Fate
[1:24:50] <$Falilth> they put bombs on his balls in the new nick cage movie
[1:24:51] <vulpuspictus> no character just himself
[1:24:53] <%MarylandJutsu> HOWD IT GET BURNED
[1:24:53] <illTemperedSeaBass> Nicolas Cage should be both a Killer and a Survivor.
[1:24:56] <FlashFrame> I want Grandma Laurie Strode from Halloween 2018 and 2018 Mikey skins.
[1:24:59] <draca23> That's a genuine problem among Fey in some DnD lore. They DON'T know you die when you are killed lol.
[1:24:59] <Thirtine> @illTemperedSeaBass fate/stay night
[1:25:01] <Dementedpenguin> @ManfredA Wicker Man survivor. Mandy Killer
[1:25:02] <+razielhex> Niocholas Cage is both a survivor and a killer
[1:25:04] <%BinaryFireball> I was severely disappointed with Pig
[1:25:10] <%joeyduderman> Nicholas Cage as both Killer AND survivor
[1:25:13] <weapon000> @illTemperedSeaBass crendorSkittles
[1:25:14] <OfficioPrefectusCorgi> Nicoles Cage as all roles
[1:25:14] <%BinaryFireball> thought it was gonna be john wick nick cage style
[1:25:17] <+razielhex> It's a special CAGEMATCH
[1:25:18] <ManfredA> I still want Ellen Ripley as a survivor
[1:25:20] <%BinaryFireball> but it was just crying dinner story
[1:25:21] <+Shad8snake> Wicker man level would be cool
[1:25:23] <+razielhex> everyone picks different Nick cages
[1:25:23] <%freelancebabymaker> i wonder if michael could get a new skin for the upcoming movie
[1:25:25] <FrankBlarghHonk> So, in the GenZ Bible, would Moses parting The Red Sea with a BeyBlade be canon?
[1:25:26] <illTemperedSeaBass> Isn't "Fate/Stay Night" the one where King Arthur is a waifu?
[1:25:29] <@Jekado> I would love the Mummy as a killer with Brenden Frasier as the survivor.
[1:25:30] <$ErikFeral> People died when they are killed, unless healed by a teammate cause heroes never die
[1:25:30] <%radda343> Jodie is video game aware so that would be neat
[1:25:31] <FlashFrame> Pinhead struts like he owns the place.
[1:25:34] <ChaoticArsonist_> I am a cringer
[1:25:34] <+democrazyyy> i love how he phases through windows instead of vaulting over normally
[1:25:41] <@SoFarFetched> @illTemperedSeaBass theres "alot" of waifus like that
[1:25:42] <cureneckbeard> @illtemperedseabass it's a bible quote
[1:25:47] <%freelancebabymaker> michael myers looks so fucking EVIL in the trailers for the new movie
[1:25:47] <%MarylandJutsu> @Jekado or evie, shes cool
[1:25:52] <GeoGio3> You can now play as just Nicholas CAge, Killer nic, survivor Nic, object nic
[1:25:52] <%freelancebabymaker> lol
[1:25:54] <@SoFarFetched> BBARRAAA
[1:25:56] <%TheWinged7> spacebar-aaahh
[1:25:59] <%doomunderthestairs> tittirs ahhhh
[1:26:03] <%ospreyworks> so excited for the next Halloween movie
[1:26:09] <mr_saturday93> so many uhs
[1:26:10] <@Jekado> @MarylandJutsu yee evie would be dope too.
[1:26:11] <ChrisPlaysThing> The QuarkBar
[1:26:17] <+the_mental_punk> How’s everyone doing, just joined the steam, watching from work
[1:26:18] <$ErikFeral> I want to watch the pig film with Nic Cage
[1:26:19] <$Falilth> why does pinhead look like he's strutting in 6 inch heels ?
[1:26:21] <ManfredA> they put a massive amount of effort into his animations and visuals
[1:26:22] <FlashFrame> That teleport is so movie accurate.
[1:26:22] <+Blargimazombie> His vault animation is great
[1:26:27] <ChaoticArsonist_> Thou whipped out thine cock too early again
[1:26:28] <+Blargimazombie> He just phases through it
[1:26:30] <+razielhex> @Falilth he probably is?
[1:26:31] <FlashFrame> yeah his vault he juts phases through the wall.
[1:26:41] <@SoFarFetched> I'll Mori you paige
[1:26:43] <%ospreyworks> one of the terminators would make a cool killer
[1:26:49] <emper0rner0> I would do anything to get an old Michael and old Laurie skin from the new movies
[1:26:49] <@SoFarFetched> geefTux
[1:27:01] <Prism_Wing> I was thinking how a cult leader killer could work in this game, and literally just yesterday I thought of their passive power being being 4 buffed hooks just like Scourge hook lol.
[1:27:01] <%NeonLight> how long til xenomorph?
[1:27:04] <%MarylandJutsu> The Mummy with Brendan Fraiser and Rachel Weiz was apparenlty a lot of my friends bisexual awakening
[1:27:08] <+the_mental_punk> @peachsaliva folding laundry at my hotel night job.
[1:27:10] <FrankBlarghHonk> A killer based on "The Fly" could be interesting
[1:27:14] <AFlyingTaco1> He just pulls out a gun and shoots you
[1:27:17] <+democrazyyy> when do we get the alien with facehugger eggs around the map
[1:27:22] <FlashFrame> well, we are getting an ALIEN tv series, so a Xenomorph killer would be pretty cool.
[1:27:26] <+TheTimelordPan> Jack from The Shining would be awesome, and the Overlook as a level...
[1:27:28] <+Blargimazombie> Yeah get terminator for a robot killer, don't give FNAF man more money
[1:27:29] <%joeyduderman> I want Pumpkin Head to take the place of Demigorgon
[1:27:33] <%radda343> only if the drum bit of the terminator theme is is chase music
[1:27:34] <@SoFarFetched> HE CAME
[1:27:36] <$Falilth> the level would be the nostromo
[1:27:38] <@SoFarFetched> sipsipGasm sipsipGasm sipsipGasm
[1:27:39] <+razielhex> rawhead rex
[1:27:41] <%JaydenSai> HE CAME!
[1:27:42] <+Blargimazombie> Then you can get Sarah Conner for survivor
[1:27:47] <%freelancebabymaker> RAWHEAD REX
[1:27:55] <%Drowsy_Tuna> would it do gun?
[1:28:01] <+razielhex> his only weakness is MPREG
[1:28:01] <$MrJoeJoe> i would love the t 800 kill with the power of gun
[1:28:02] <%freelancebabymaker> @razielhex YEAH
[1:28:05] <+the_mental_punk> So when the sale for stranger things goes up. All the cosmetics and characters will cost 90 dollars
[1:28:06] <%Spydurman> and upon losing for the 5th time to a child Jesse declared to his followers "balls, balls in my ass" and thus it is written
[1:28:18] <NeroInfinite> It'd have to be the liquid terminator unless we want another killer with gun lol
[1:28:22] <%radda343> oh no he has ruin whatever will you do
[1:28:35] <FlashFrame> T1000 would be the best pick for terminator killer, yeah.
[1:28:38] <%MarylandJutsu> What if.....a bladerunner expansion with a replicant killer and Deckard as a survivor
[1:28:46] <rudiciuscaesar> ah man, a Terminator would be great
[1:28:50] <%NeonLight> T1000 better have the best run animation
[1:28:54] <illTemperedSeaBass> @NeroInfinite It could also be lady-terminator whose power is breast enlargement.
[1:28:58] <@SoFarFetched> yeah Elodie is being chased so claudette went to go save Ace
[1:28:59] <Prism_Wing> There are so many Ninja quotes that could fit in the meme bible.
[1:29:01] <%freelancebabymaker> we need pumpkinhead to complete the P HEAD trio
[1:29:14] <+razielhex> Any creature that has ever killed Lance Henrikson
[1:29:21] <+razielhex> Whioch includes fukken Pinhead
[1:29:24] <%NeonLight> F it, Ringwraith from LOTR
[1:29:27] <+the_mental_punk> I feel like Stefan Valentino from evil within 2 could be inter grated so easily. He already has a power concept that would work for this game
[1:29:35] <%asakura_ayase> I would love alien killer and ripley survivor
[1:29:35] <$AzureGale> If you're shitting balls see a doctor IMMEDIATELY
[1:29:37] <+rancherobill> what about a jurassic park raptor
[1:29:38] <ChrisPlaysThing> BugSaliva
[1:29:41] <%radda343> we can't see it
[1:29:43] <+Blargimazombie> We can't see it lol
[1:29:45] <%maskofmichael> WE can't tell
[1:29:47] <@SoFarFetched> Killers can look the other way while moving to not trigger spine chill.
[1:29:52] <scrumbotime> if you're shitting balls, see a doctor, if you're shitting cubes, you're a wombat
[1:29:54] <%JaydenSai> You're blocking it
[1:29:55] <%freelancebabymaker> @razielhex i forget did pumpkinhead kill lance henriksen too
[1:29:57] <rudiciuscaesar> lmao no, it has to be the Trex
[1:29:58] <FlashFrame> JP Raptor killer, with Alan Grant survivor.
[1:30:04] <+lynlyn_ow> move to the other side paige
[1:30:04] <Decarcassor> Killers can counter spinechill by crabwalking.
[1:30:08] <emper0rner0> Is Spinechill making that loud noise occasionally? Or is that Pinhead?
[1:30:10] <ManfredA> better solve that box
[1:30:14] <GeoGio3> sauron as a monster fuck it, get legolas and frodo or some shit as survivors
[1:30:16] <@SoFarFetched> spinechill doesnt make a noise
[1:30:17] <%radda343> man what a great power to use with ruin
[1:30:21] <$Falilth> yall are sleeping on a sarah fiers killer from fear street.  it would play like a rts
[1:30:23] <+razielhex> @freelancebabymaker Yes at the end
[1:30:24] <@SoFarFetched> that electric noise is from Ruin whenever she stops working on the gen
[1:30:26] <sydowoodo> damn that sucks :/
[1:30:28] <Prism_Wing> YO! Ok hear me out. Next killer: The Anaconda. Survivor: Jennifer Lopez.
[1:30:30] <phantomsleeves> wow so you HAVE TO do that box eventually
[1:30:37] <%freelancebabymaker> @razielhex get him in here
[1:30:38] <+the_mental_punk> Do you thing his power where he can look through the portal works on spinechill?
[1:30:44] <scrumbotime> Chain Hunt is just, so good
[1:30:50] <@SoFarFetched> Elodie is solving it
[1:30:56] <@SoFarFetched> HUB tells you
[1:30:56] <FlashFrame> chain hunt is awesome.
[1:30:57] <$GeneralSCPatton> The true horror game is failing to kill a giant house centipede before it goes under something you can't move. Objective: SURVIVE
[1:31:11] <ChaoticArsonist_> Box fun times
[1:31:14] <FlashFrame> Pinhead took her down and he got the box.
[1:31:19] <%radda343> he wasn't doing anything so he teleported to her
[1:31:23] <%JaydenSai> She didnt get to solve it, Pinhead came
[1:31:27] <@Jekado> the hub shows who has the box and it animates when they are trying to solve it.
[1:31:28] <%radda343> you kinda have to wait until he's in a chase
[1:31:30] <$AzureGale> That sounded like a peach scream :x
[1:31:32] <ManfredA> I still think The Thing would be fun but impostor killers don't really work in DBD'
[1:31:36] <ChrisPlaysThing> @GeneralSCPatton It's the Centipedes house now
[1:31:36] <reddpop_> that's what she said?
[1:31:38] <ChaoticArsonist_> Although, I did start the old English speaking
[1:31:43] <@Jekado> CAME
[1:31:43] <scrumbotime> HE CAME
[1:31:44] <%ospreyworks> xenomorph with the hunter's bear traps reskinned to eggs and face huggers that temporarily incapacitate survivors, and then you have to get it removed like the pig's head trap
[1:31:44] <ChaoticArsonist_> Annoyingly enough
[1:31:46] <@SoFarFetched> HE  CAME
[1:31:46] <FlashFrame> he's teleporting
[1:31:48] <+SausageShogun> HE CAME
[1:31:49] <ManfredA> HE CAME
[1:31:51] <%radda343> he teleported
[1:31:55] <+TopTieramisu> holy shit, pinhead
[1:32:01] <+TopTieramisu> when did he get added?
[1:32:02] <scrumbotime> @radda343 pinhead can do both
[1:32:04] <%radda343> you gotta wait until he's occupied to solve
[1:32:05] <rudiciuscaesar> @ospreyworks that's a good diea
[1:32:05] <ManfredA> he's so menacing
[1:32:07] <rudiciuscaesar> idea*
[1:32:08] <+glgzephyr> oh lawd he comin
[1:32:08] <%MarylandJutsu> hes coming for your wigpaige
[1:32:09] <@SoFarFetched> LUL
[1:32:10] <@SoFarFetched> everytime
[1:32:13] <tuesti> LUL
[1:32:13] <FastmanJones> He came
[1:32:14] <illTemperedSeaBass> Moral victory.
[1:32:15] <+the_mental_punk> Have you experienced the bug with the chains yet? @peachsaliva
[1:32:18] <+SWFanatic> hehehehehe ... oh
[1:32:25] <%MarylandJutsu> @the_mental_punk the first round we did
[1:32:27] <@SoFarFetched> @the_mental_punk that was the beginning of the stream LUL
[1:32:30] <rudiciuscaesar> hang in there Paige
[1:32:30] <+LensWander> Paige opened the box, didn't she?
[1:32:32] <Joem1k> pinhead's no joke
[1:32:33] <FlashFrame> @the_mental_punk multiple times, first game she got hit with it.
[1:32:34] <keemii_don> who is he?
[1:32:34] <ChaoticArsonist_> The chase music is so disorienting
[1:32:36] <mythrilcrafter> Doing things seems louder than usual, was there an update that made game sounds louder?
[1:32:38] <+the_mental_punk> @sofarfetched thank you
[1:32:42] <%graemecrackers2> damn right through the hook like butter
[1:32:51] <@SoFarFetched> AND order food
[1:32:52] <Faustgesicht> Love him and his perks are fantastic
[1:32:55] <illTemperedSeaBass> "Dude, you broke my rubix cube!" -Pinhead
[1:33:01] <$AzureGale> Time 2 despair pee
[1:33:07] <%radda343> time for a mcdonald
[1:33:08] <%freelancebabymaker> in terms of like non licensed killers id like to see a scary deformed possessed girl like amy from faith or the woman from the end of rec [REC]
[1:33:10] <+the_mental_punk> Foods
[1:33:21] <%graemecrackers2> such sweet suffering
[1:33:28] <%freelancebabymaker> just mash together two of the scariest pieces of media ive ever seen please
[1:33:31] <%freelancebabymaker> right into my mouth
[1:33:37] <illTemperedSeaBass> Isn't this the intro theme to that old Sonic cartoon?
[1:33:37] <%maskofmichael> Paige ordering food: "Pat-uh! I'm hungry-uh!"
[1:33:42] <@SoFarFetched> yes
[1:33:44] <@SoFarFetched> its a remix
[1:33:59] <+razielhex> Lance Henrikson has failed to take on:  Aliens, The Antichrist, Pirahnas, Terminators, Xenomorphs, Pumpkinhead, Cajun Jean-Claude Van Dam & Wilford Brimley, Ghostface, Predators, Pinhead, Sasquatches, the British Empire, a Succubus, and a gingerclown
[1:34:01] <@SoFarFetched> https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MzfBMHkaVsU
[1:34:07] <+the_mental_punk> Apparently if you Lori while the chain bug is happening the survivor will be directly behind pinhead during the animation instead of the right place
[1:34:21] <+lynlyn_ow> @SoFarFetched how do you feel about the new killer? A tier, F tier, somewhere in between?
[1:34:30] <%mckraven> @freelancebabymaker pretty much any character that could be played by Javier Botet would be cool and scary
[1:34:49] <%freelancebabymaker> @mckraven literally yes
[1:34:57] <+democrazyyy> ive seen him mori empty space which is funny
[1:35:15] <+democrazyyy> with the survivor still walking around in background bugged until it finished
[1:35:26] <%freelancebabymaker> i just want amy from faith but way longer and lankier
[1:35:27] <@SoFarFetched> @lynlyn_ow I havent been able to play with him myself today geefSweat but I feel he is an in between like maybe B?
[1:35:40] <@SoFarFetched> though also depends high or low B geefThink
[1:35:45] <+democrazyyy> i want a werewolf killer real bad
[1:35:51] <%freelancebabymaker> i wonder if that would translate well into dbd at all? the style of faith i mean
[1:35:54] <+democrazyyy> maybe they could reskin demo as one somehow with that lunge
[1:35:59] <+the_mental_punk> So the paragraph survivor that’s suppose to come later. Who could that be? Any hints or leaks out yet about that?
[1:36:13] <+SWFanatic> wah wah
[1:36:19] <%Drowsy_Tuna> wah
[1:36:22] <illTemperedSeaBass> "Baby is feet"?
[1:36:25] <tuesti> wah
[1:36:26] <%asakura_ayase> Wah
[1:36:26] <+lynlyn_ow> gotcha thanks. Just trying to get a feel of how ppl view him right now. Seems strong in the hands of someone who practice and know how to play him and maybe with teh right perks/addons he seems really strong @SoFarFetched
[1:36:28] <%MarylandJutsu> Wah wah?
[1:36:30] <@SoFarFetched> "no thoughts,head empty"
[1:36:30] <%freelancebabymaker> faith is still one of the scariest games ive ever seen
[1:36:38] <$AzureGale> O_O
[1:36:38] <%freelancebabymaker> it has not been topped for me recently
[1:36:44] <%MarylandJutsu> @freelancebabymaker mortiiiiiisssss
[1:36:52] <OfficioPrefectusCorgi> Your Welcome
[1:36:58] <deusvultdegenerate> Faith is super good
[1:37:11] <+razielhex> it's like 10,000 thank yous when all you need is Text-to-speech
[1:37:12] <illTemperedSeaBass> Faith is better than it has any right to be.
[1:37:14] <%freelancebabymaker> @deusvultdegenerate that name fits lol
[1:37:19] <OfficioPrefectusCorgi> Bread butts
[1:37:23] <%MarylandJutsu> corgies aare just lil sausages
[1:37:25] <%MarylandJutsu> with legs
[1:37:27] <illTemperedSeaBass> "Mortis" is even an unreasonably funny meme.
[1:37:29] <@MelBrooksKA> Heading to bed, have a good night everyone
[1:37:37] <@SoFarFetched> @lynlyn_ow oh yeah no problem geefWink sometimes its interesting to see how people feel about a new killer when its watching/playing as him.
[1:37:38] <%Fooguwu> corgis be havin that dumptruck ass
[1:37:50] <%freelancebabymaker> faith is like you nailed an atari to a chair and forced it to watch bootleg european copies of the exorcist
[1:37:53] <@SoFarFetched> oh yeah thats her new greek skin
[1:38:18] <%CopperTucker> Paige why
[1:38:21] <+lynlyn_ow> @SoFarFetched yea exactly always good to get others opinion esp ones that know a lot about the game and play both sides :)
[1:38:27] <%MarylandJutsu> Also paige, i love that gief is a huge coward toward smaller dogs
[1:38:30] <%MarylandJutsu> i love him
[1:38:38] <illTemperedSeaBass> @freelancebabymaker You trapped an Atari 2600 in a haunted house and had an Atari Jaguar chase the poor thing.
[1:38:40] <deusvultdegenerate> @freelancebabymaker I aim to please
[1:38:44] <Dementedpenguin> That's fine. We experienced FULL BROOKS in For The Uniform LUL
[1:38:50] <%mckraven> are you still on DS9?
[1:38:50] <+democrazyyy> i always mean to start watching star trek but i never know where to start
[1:39:09] <%Ranryu692> TNG
[1:39:11] <%MarylandJutsu> Plague often does art while watching
[1:39:13] <+SciFiBrony> What Star Trek are you on?
[1:39:16] <%freelancebabymaker> the flashlight sequence in the like demo for faith episode 3 oh my god
[1:39:18] <Tracazoid> The original series or TNG, whichever floats your boat more
[1:39:19] <%maskofmichael> You star at episode 1
[1:39:22] <@SoFarFetched> https://picarto.tv/plague <--- for Pat,Paige, and Plague watching Star Trek
[1:39:23] <%freelancebabymaker> shit a whole through my chair
[1:39:31] <@SoFarFetched> @SciFiBrony DS9 Season 5 I believe
[1:39:37] <%MarylandJutsu> That empty barrell has NO HONOR
[1:39:41] <%tkzhyon> hi paige sipsipHellmo
[1:39:45] <%CopperTucker> Original is fun. TNG is good. DS9 is really good.
[1:39:47] <%joeyduderman> TOS is trash
[1:39:47] <ChrisPlaysThing> TNG is a very good place
[1:39:52] <Piemono> DS( > TNG
[1:39:53] <ChrisPlaysThing> if you skip the trash
[1:39:54] <+RandyFistburgers> tng holds up mostly
[1:39:56] <%joeyduderman> DS9 is god
[1:39:59] <+bestefforts> My friend had me start with TNG as well. I fell so hard for Data
[1:39:59] <%CopperTucker> TOS has some really great episodes
[1:40:02] <illTemperedSeaBass> My mom tried to get me into Star Trek TNG, but I couldn't get passed the first episode and Q's moon-sized net of Quantum Mike & Ike's.
[1:40:02] <+rancherobill> if you have too, watch the og movies
[1:40:05] <%freelancebabymaker> i cant do sci fi unless theres giant robots
[1:40:06] <%CopperTucker> you just gotta roll with it being campy
[1:40:06] <+rancherobill> then tng
[1:40:08] <deusvultdegenerate> I liked DS9 a lot, seen most of TOS, but I haven't sat through TNG
[1:40:13] <+SciFiBrony> TNG IS great. But TOS has a stronger start than TNG
[1:40:14] <%X2Eliah> You know you could skip the old stuff and just start with Picard
[1:40:14] <vulpuspictus> Don't forget to watch lower decks after
[1:40:20] <%mckraven> TNG is a great starting point. DS9 you kinda need to have seen at least a few episodes of TNG to get the impact of the opening
[1:40:22] <@SoFarFetched> @lynlyn_ow oh yeah for sure,I like playing both because the experience play as  and going against a killer is definitely interesting. Especially when you gotta think like a survivor as a killer and think like a killer as a survivor geefO
[1:40:26] <Piemono> Picards feels like an ideal, Sisko feels like a real dude
[1:40:27] <%Ranryu692> DS9 is amazing, but it isn't a good one to start with because of how much it builds off of what TOS and TNG did
[1:40:33] <cureneckbeard> ^
[1:40:34] <ChrisPlaysThing> You just need to be in the mindset of the time period to enjoy TOS
[1:40:35] <%CopperTucker> TNG takes a few seasons to really find its footing
[1:40:40] <+the_mental_punk> Still going through GOT right now. Hope it turns out good
[1:40:43] <%Ranryu692> first season of TNG has some rough episodes
[1:40:45] <tanarath> TOS has higher highs but has jank, TNG has.... problems, but it's good.
[1:40:46] <%Spydurman> TNG is a good starting point, just survive S1
[1:40:51] <+SWFanatic> "Theres no medical reason for a headache."
[1:41:03] <%freelancebabymaker> the only good show ive watched fully at least recently was invincible
[1:41:04] <+democrazyyy> i heard of an episode where they turn into lizards and have babies before turning back and never mention it again, which greatly amuses me
[1:41:07] <ChrisPlaysThing> Survive beardless Riker
[1:41:09] <%MarylandJutsu> Remember when Worf got his spine shattered by an empty Barrel??
[1:41:10] <%MarylandJutsu> good times
[1:41:18] <Burncoat> Remember the time Troi got pregnant with a space ghost baby and it died
[1:41:19] <%CopperTucker> @democrazyyy That's Voyager
[1:41:21] <Dementedpenguin> @democrazyyy that's voyager
[1:41:35] <illTemperedSeaBass> TNG would be 75% better if that mary-sue kid didn't exist. What was his name again?
[1:41:35] <+lynlyn_ow> @SoFarFetched it definitely helps me improve game play on both bc you get a feel for "oh this is how survivors think" or "oh this is what a killer would do" and then get frustrating games on both sides LUL
[1:41:43] <%Ranryu692> remember when Beverly was smiling when she told Worf she couldn't fix his spine
[1:41:58] <Dementedpenguin> @illTemperedSeaBass wesley?
[1:41:58] <%mckraven> season 1 has some good episodes. season 2 of tng is a weird starting point considering the first episode is that Troi space rape episode
[1:42:00] <%JaydenSai> It's been fun watching your journey through Star Trek, Paige! @PeachSaliva
[1:42:08] <illTemperedSeaBass> @Dementedpenguin Yeah, Wesley.
[1:42:10] <%Ranryu692> Wesley SUCKS
[1:42:13] <cureneckbeard> That was the Voyager episode Threshold. The writers of that episode went on to make a sci-fi series named Threshold which starred Peter Dinklage and Brent Spiner, and got cancelled before it finished the first season
[1:42:14] <Dementedpenguin> LUL
[1:42:16] <%freelancebabymaker> nice lol
[1:42:26] <tanarath> Voyager was the brainchild of THAT PRODUCER and it shows. the actors do well despite that.
[1:42:27] <%CopperTucker> @PeachSaliva have you ever heard the song "The USS Make Shit Up"?
[1:42:28] <%Agami23> did you know there was a star trek green lantern crossover comic?
[1:42:41] <vulpuspictus> remember that time wesley killed another student at the academy and didn't show any remorse
[1:42:52] <@SoFarFetched> @lynlyn_ow yeah I can't tell you how many times as killer Im like "Id probably be hiding over here right now" and find a survivor there geefLul
[1:42:53] <weapon000> @Agami23 and an X-men one
[1:42:55] <+Ches_Neckbeard> how are you excited for voyager?
[1:43:01] <Dementedpenguin> My favorite Wesley episode is when Picard cusses him out.
[1:43:02] <%Ranryu692> remember when Beverly fucked the same Irish ghost that fucked her mom and grandma?
[1:43:03] <mynefariousplans> there is a green lantern Planet of the Apes crossover as well
[1:43:05] <%X2Eliah> Oh you're looking forward to Voyager?
[1:43:07] <%X2Eliah> LUL
[1:43:07] <tlflordhand> DS9 would be great just because Odo and the supporting characters. I despise cpt Sissyco who is more of a prophet martyr than a starfleet cpt
[1:43:11] <AFlyingTaco1> LUL
[1:43:12] <@SoFarFetched> I mean she eats McDonalds
[1:43:12] <%altwaal05> Voyager is my favorite!
[1:43:13] <@SoFarFetched> Kappa
[1:43:13] <%freelancebabymaker> pretty sure star trek crossed over with transformers too
[1:43:15] <%mckraven> @agami23 if you wanna see a silly star trek comic look up Star Trek: mirror broken. Everyone is super ripped
[1:43:17] <illTemperedSeaBass> Suddenly your romance with Pat makes sense. Kappa
[1:43:18] <%MarylandJutsu> Paige loves GARBAGE
[1:43:19] <+SWFanatic> not doodoo, just poopoo
[1:43:20] <Dementedpenguin> Voyager is insanity.
[1:43:21] <Tracazoid> Paige gets to see all of Janeway's warcrimes
[1:43:21] <%NeonLight> So bull doodoo?
[1:43:22] <+bestefforts> Voyager is so good
[1:43:23] <%MarylandJutsu> looks at hooker boots
[1:43:25] <tanarath> You'll enjoy it when it isn't terrible.
[1:43:25] <+Ches_Neckbeard> Paige as a man who enjoys garbage it's way past garbage
[1:43:27] <+SciFiBrony> You and Pat DID pay to see the Emoji Movie 😆
[1:43:34] <ChrisPlaysThing> I saw more Picard recently, Boy do the foreign influences show up strong >_>. Like Wire-fu style
[1:43:39] <mynefariousplans> I have been watching DS9 clips on YouTube but haven't seen the show
[1:43:43] <tanarath> GIMME DA GARBAGE
[1:43:46] <AFlyingTaco1> Oh god why
[1:43:51] <%ospreyworks> I love trash!
[1:43:54] <%freelancebabymaker> thats like my favorite podcast clip lmao
[1:43:54] <weapon000> Janeway is history's greatest villian
[1:43:54] <%NeonLight> Gotta do it for *content*
[1:43:55] <%Ranryu692> "for the podcast" suuuuure LUL
[1:43:56] <AFlyingTaco1> Oh well that's understandable then
[1:43:56] <+Vestillion> that voice coming out of that model is just so jarring to me
[1:43:58] <%MarylandJutsu> ENDLESS TRASH
[1:44:00] <illTemperedSeaBass> There's "good" garbage, there's "bad" garbage, and there's "actual insanity-inducing gaslighting" garbage. Voyager is the latter-most.
[1:44:09] <%maskofmichael> In your opinion, what's the difference between good-shit and bad-shit media?
[1:44:13] <%freelancebabymaker> ass hook
[1:44:14] <ChrisPlaysThing> Ninja Romulan Picard protector
[1:44:14] <+democrazyyy> SOLVE THE CUUUUUBE
[1:44:30] <%X2Eliah> Voyager is really not that bad, it's just made by people who think different.
[1:44:32] <tanarath> Paige, you need a raccoon version of your avatar
[1:44:33] <%NeonLight> HE CAME
[1:44:36] <+democrazyyy> he CAME
[1:44:39] <%mckraven> @maskofmichael for me its all about if it keeps me entertained
[1:44:41] <+glgzephyr> he CAME
[1:44:42] <%JaydenSai> HE CAME
[1:44:46] <+lynlyn_ow> @SoFarFetched HAHA! totally the blendettes are not happy with me or the urbanly evading survivors bc i watch out the corner of my eye for those sneaky sneaky survivors. Glad to see someone thinks the same way i do haha
[1:44:49] <%joeyduderman> I get that Pinhead is a DBD killer but wasn't the villain in the movies
[1:44:57] <Joem1k> man pinhead is ruthless.
[1:44:59] <+InternetShis> Dirty twitch ads
[1:45:03] <+TopTieramisu> Jebaited
[1:45:07] <%X2Eliah> Paige
[1:45:11] <illTemperedSeaBass> @X2Eliah It is absolutely that bad. Janeway doesn't have a character.
[1:45:11] <%X2Eliah> order of events
[1:45:12] <tlflordhand> They ruined the borg in voyager. But, SevenofNine was a cool ass character
[1:45:13] <+InternetShis> No I do not want to die for oil, US Army
[1:45:15] <%NeonLight> actually yeah, Bill is here, do we have a L4D killer?
[1:45:20] <%MarylandJutsu> @joeyduderman hes the icon of the series though
[1:45:25] <+TopTieramisu> well, this cenobites
[1:45:25] <%JaydenSai> @NeonLight Nope!
[1:45:25] <+democrazyyy> wheres my vampire and werewolf killers
[1:45:27] <%X2Eliah> @illTemperedSeaBass And yet she is the most talked-about captain
[1:45:28] <%freelancebabymaker> @joeyduderman i mean pyramid head isnt technically the villain of silent hill 2
[1:45:29] <+democrazyyy> or a cool mummy
[1:45:34] <mynefariousplans> My apartment would be way cleaner of I could convert trash to food like star trek
[1:45:45] <2atoich1> patiently waiting for a COVID based killer.
[1:45:49] <illTemperedSeaBass> @X2Eliah Because of how bad she is. She isn't Captain Jack Sparrow, my man.
[1:45:53] <ChrisPlaysThing> @NeonLight Would be either charger(hillbilly) or jockey
[1:45:53] <%mckraven> @freelancebabymaker is there even a villain of silent hill 2?
[1:45:53] <%joeyduderman> @freelancebabymaker I never actually played it
[1:45:59] <+the_mental_punk> James Sunderland as a alt skin for pyramid head
[1:46:03] <+SWFanatic> damn
[1:46:06] <%radda343> thank bill for that BT lol
[1:46:07] <%freelancebabymaker> @mckraven i mean the town maybe
[1:46:09] <ergulor> of gripes
[1:46:14] <%JaydenSai> Vommy Mommy!
[1:46:19] <%joeyduderman> I love how much I get to hear the word Titties in this stream
[1:46:21] <%radda343> vommy mommy the best
[1:46:22] <+SWFanatic> noice
[1:46:22] <%X2Eliah> @JaydenSai .... no
[1:46:24] <$AzureGale> They should make a Karen killer
[1:46:24] <hearingthenseeing> Paige you gotta let that go
[1:46:27] <%JaydenSai> @JaydenSai Yes
[1:46:35] <+the_mental_punk> I want a blob killer
[1:46:36] <%mckraven> @freelancebabymaker james is both hero and villain
[1:46:37] <+Toservethemaster> I'm antsy for another original killer soon
[1:46:46] <+TopTieramisu> i like the implementation of pinhead
[1:46:48] <vulpuspictus> Janeway's a killer, she killed tuvix
[1:46:56] <+democrazyyy> youll die alone
[1:46:58] <%MarylandJutsu> Paige will gladly die on this hillalone
[1:46:59] <Piemono> Gonna die on that Hook
[1:47:00] <+InternetShis> When is Jerma gonna be a killer
[1:47:02] <weapon000> @AzureGale You hear about that terrible karen horror movie
[1:47:02] <greenoni> Paige you can't juke this killler
[1:47:04] <peachy996> Fuck Tuvix
[1:47:05] <hearingthenseeing> she will die on her poop hill
[1:47:05] <blue8moon> oh I recognize that guy
[1:47:10] <sydowoodo> but why tho???
[1:47:11] <%X2Eliah> I am not sre about Pinhead's animations, he looks so stiff
[1:47:16] <peachy996> Tuvix is an abomination that deserved to die.
[1:47:27] <peachy996> Talaxian and Vulcan abomination
[1:47:32] <+democrazyyy> my favorite animation is his vaulting one, he just phases through the wall instead of clambering over
[1:47:32] <+the_mental_punk> Megan Fox with Jennifer’s body is a killer option
[1:47:33] <Dementedpenguin> >_>
[1:47:33] <mynefariousplans> Has everyone here seen the amazing horror music video parodies by the Merkins
[1:47:34] <+InternetShis> You Can (Not) Juke Pinhead
[1:47:35] <cureneckbeard> I think Babylon 5 is worth watching at some point
[1:47:39] <illTemperedSeaBass> Janeway is so inconsistently-written, so schizophrenic due to bad writing that the actress literally said at one point that she began playing the part like Janeway was crazy.
[1:47:41] <AFlyingTaco1> He's pretty stiff in the sequel too
[1:47:41] <weapon000> @X2Eliah I mean that's kinda the point of the character
[1:47:42] <razethetek> wubbyPog
[1:47:42] <%mckraven> @x2eliah he isn't the most flexible character in the movies either
[1:47:47] <%Ranryu692> I'd imagine the costume was rather difficult to move in
[1:47:47] <%NeonLight> I like it, adds to how alien he is
[1:47:48] <+TopTieramisu> the first 2 hellraisers are the only ones that anyone should watch
[1:47:48] <peachy996> They all walk around the Cenobites
[1:47:54] <+coke_monster> Im very stuff.
[1:48:02] <Burncoat> Didn't they make him the head of the Cenobites because the others couldn't move in their costumes?
[1:48:02] <%JaydenSai> Pinhead doesnt animate much in the movies anyway
[1:48:03] <peachy996> The only one that's actively moving is the Engineer in the hallways
[1:48:24] <$AzureGale> @weapon000 I have not heard of this Karen horror movie.  I will have to look this up
[1:48:27] <+Vestillion> you'd think they'd die of blood loss after the second meathook impalement
[1:48:30] <peachy996> Also yes first 2 Hellraisers are the only good ones
[1:48:32] <AFlyingTaco1> Isn't Hellraiser 3 about a big dumb ghost war or some shit?
[1:48:35] <%X2Eliah> oh ok. Haven't seen the movies. Had a wrong impression from pop culture :)
[1:48:43] <%JaydenSai> YOU OPENED IT
[1:48:44] <%MarylandJutsu> Elmo opened the boooox
[1:48:51] <$AzureGale> WHAT'S IN THE BOX !?!?!!?!??!?!?!?!
[1:48:55] <+InternetShis> Mom said it's my turn on the puzzle box
[1:49:01] <illTemperedSeaBass> Elmo is sitting in the box RIGHT NOW! D:
[1:49:03] <+TopTieramisu> which is the hellraiser in space?
[1:49:06] <+the_mental_punk> Hell raiser 1 & 2 is honestly very lovecraftian
[1:49:17] <peachy996> If you're really fiending for more Hellraiser you can try Hellraiser Inferno but eh
[1:49:25] <%mckraven> @x2eliah pinhead is actually very calm and composed. He just wants you to join him in the pleasures of pain
[1:49:26] <+TopTieramisu> i loved the depiction of hell in hellraiser 2
[1:49:27] <vulpuspictus> event horizon?
[1:49:41] <%MarylandJutsu> RIP paige
[1:49:47] <@SoFarFetched> gotta do them Jukes
[1:49:48] <$AzureGale> F
[1:49:50] <GeoGio3> I want his coat
[1:49:51] <%X2Eliah> @mckraven Just like Janeway then
[1:49:52] <weapon000> @AFlyingTaco1 yeah it's takes place in future and space
[1:49:53] <sydowoodo> it does seem touhg
[1:49:53] <%Spydurman> think they gotta shorten his chain range, either the chains themselves or how far he can cast em
[1:49:57] <peachy996> No more tears, It's a waste of good suffering
[1:49:57] <razethetek> heckraiser too OP
[1:49:59] <@SoFarFetched> also you mind if I join geefBush
[1:49:59] <sydowoodo> *tough
[1:50:00] <$Dotta5> Tried jiving him?
[1:50:04] <+the_mental_punk> It’s not even confirmed they come from hell. It’s just our perception of hell
[1:50:05] <illTemperedSeaBass> Just juke the chains. Kappa
[1:50:07] <+democrazyyy> when he chains his vision is tied to the chain which seems like the best opportunity once you juke em
[1:50:08] <illTemperedSeaBass> 4Head
[1:50:09] <tlflordhand> how exactly can you juke this op character?
[1:50:19] <%X2Eliah> LUL heckraiser, nice
[1:50:19] <%AncelDeLambert> devs, when I asked you to fix pallet looping, I didn't mean making one killer completely counter it
[1:50:23] <+InternetShis> Ya zooged when a shoulda zonked
[1:50:31] <Faustgesicht> Has hillbilly turning to
[1:50:36] <emper0rner0> Once people know how to play as him he's gonna be pretty oppressive
[1:50:37] <BooitsDock> what the dog doing
[1:50:40] <+democrazyyy> he has to like pilot them into you which is pretty disorienting to me personally
[1:50:41] <+glgzephyr> it's probably worth playing him at least once, to see what it's like from his perspective
[1:50:43] <peachy996> Needs more cool Pinhead lines
[1:50:44] <@SoFarFetched> @AncelDeLambert theres a couple killers that can shoot/hit over pallets
[1:50:45] <greenoni> I don't remember which one but one of them is about a video game based on Hellraiser. I don't think the cenobites are actually in the movie just drug induced nightmare visions of them.
[1:50:47] <%NeonLight> Gief is angy!
[1:50:51] <hearingthenseeing> Gief opened the box
[1:50:54] <+coke_monster> you zapped when you shoulda zooped
[1:50:54] <+the_mental_punk> He range with his chains don’t matter cause why would you change someone very far away. His power honestly works more like clown and Freddy
[1:51:00] <+InternetShis> GIEFY NEEDS HIS WALKIES NAOW
[1:51:02] <cureneckbeard> "what the dog doing",
[1:51:03] <%3d_pbandj> you gotta solve the puzzle box! thats how you beat him!
[1:51:05] <%maskofmichael> Fat Mad Dog
[1:51:10] <BooitsDock> fat and mad
[1:51:16] <+lynlyn_ow> oh my
[1:51:17] <+TopTieramisu> monkaS
[1:51:20] <%NeonLight> ...huh
[1:51:20] <weapon000> Gief about to 720 Pat for that borger
[1:51:20] <+democrazyyy> the real killer was in the team monkaS
[1:51:23] <$AzureGale> ew
[1:51:23] <hearingthenseeing> maybe some snorting will help you?
[1:51:25] <+InternetShis> Hm
[1:51:26] <%JaydenSai> Oh ew
[1:51:30] <emper0rner0> Well we're waiting
[1:51:30] <%NeonLight> and during a pandemic
[1:51:31] <peyodogo> yikers
[1:51:31] <+nevermorecake> Gross
[1:51:32] <peachy996> That's one way to get a sub
[1:51:38] <+nevermorecake> That's how you get COVID
[1:51:39] <%X2Eliah> what
[1:51:40] <BooitsDock> angry
[1:51:45] <+the_mental_punk> The true killer in DbD is Netflix
[1:51:45] <Dementedpenguin> WutFace
[1:51:45] <+InternetShis> That's not healthy
[1:51:49] <%Agami23> i know some people who would pay for that
[1:51:52] <+Thesaltt> Oh no!  The RHONA!
[1:51:54] <illTemperedSeaBass> We shouldn't jump to "nerf this killer" so quickly. There are like, 2 killer that are generally op, and the majority of killers are kinda trash.
[1:51:54] <OfficioPrefectusCorgi> Good Golly Bad Manners
[1:51:58] <sydowoodo> they want dat saliva
[1:52:00] <@SoFarFetched> time to open our mouths SAY AAAAAAA geefJuice geefJuice geefJuice geefJuice geefJuice geefJuice
[1:52:01] <+glgzephyr> I have COVID and this is a bad idea
[1:52:03] <+coke_monster> @agami23 Me :)
[1:52:21] <+InternetShis> People drank bath water, let's not judge
[1:52:27] <peachy996> He did just come out today
[1:52:29] <+Thesaltt> It could be both?
[1:52:30] <+lynlyn_ow> what was that noise?
[1:52:39] <%X2Eliah> Ok ok Listen. Paige. Get vampire teeth inserts, open up a channel on OnlyFangs, and you'll make crazy money
[1:52:40] <+glgzephyr> @InternetShis I will judge all of them
[1:52:53] <%Drowsy_Tuna> one time I was thirsty and told my wife, she said she could split
[1:53:00] <@SoFarFetched> @lynlyn_ow believe that bell noise is the box appearing
[1:53:01] <+the_mental_punk> @peachsaliva how was your games while mmr was on
[1:53:03] <%Drowsy_Tuna> in my mouth t
[1:53:09] <+lynlyn_ow> @SoFarFetched ohh thanks!
[1:53:12] <+transporterthesequel> Kinda fits, you aren't getting away from a Cenobite
[1:53:13] <$Dotta5> Billy, sweet Billy boy I knewww you would come back
[1:53:16] <%Drowsy_Tuna> I called her bluff then she did
[1:53:27] <@SoFarFetched> yeah because quintin is already solving it
[1:53:28] <+SWFanatic> Francish
[1:53:29] <peachy996> They should have had a Kirsty
[1:53:29] <%Zeif00> I've see a lot of people just taking the box and solving it away from gens and it seems to work
[1:53:32] <+SWFanatic> Louish
[1:53:38] <@SoFarFetched> or he's holding the box hostage
[1:53:40] <$Dotta5> nailed it
[1:53:42] <illTemperedSeaBass> Hah.
[1:53:44] <@SoFarFetched> Im pretty sure he's holding it hostage LUL
[1:53:52] <+democrazyyy> i love this map
[1:54:06] <@SoFarFetched> "GIVE ME THE BOXXX"
[1:54:06] <%NeonLight> oh hell....raiser
[1:54:11] <%X2Eliah> It would be nice to get a Nazgul killer (and maybe two hobbits as survivors)
[1:54:14] <hearingthenseeing> Days since last stream with no musical references: 0
[1:54:15] <peachy996> Cheezus Wept
[1:54:21] <+TopTieramisu> what's in the boooooox
[1:54:23] <+coke_monster> The box! You gotta get the box!
[1:54:27] <%JaydenSai> The bawwwwx
[1:54:38] <%JaydenSai> Its the pasta rat!
[1:54:41] <+the_mental_punk> God is in the box
[1:54:45] <$Dotta5> Pat pees his pants, it's THE coolest
[1:54:45] <spongeofmystery> Paige, as a fellow Kate main I may have to switch from her leather outfit to your custom one
[1:54:50] <illTemperedSeaBass> @X2Eliah "Why yes, we had Hobbit. But what about Second Hobit?"
[1:54:50] <+InternetShis> Pat says Muh
[1:54:51] <+Thesaltt> I love that your avatar's mouth is constantly going "WA!  WA!" at almost all times.
[1:54:53] <+lynlyn_ow> oh you get a flashlight for doing the box?
[1:55:13] <AFlyingTaco1> Oh wow that's a blast from the past
[1:55:15] <@SoFarFetched> no she had to drop her flashlight to grab the box
[1:55:16] <@SoFarFetched> LUL
[1:55:22] <@SoFarFetched> can't hold two things
[1:55:22] <+lynlyn_ow> OH HAHAHAHAHA
[1:55:22] <greenoni> @lynlyn_ow nah she started with it
[1:55:29] <%mckraven> I'd like to see art the clown from terrifier as a killer
[1:55:29] <+lynlyn_ow> i'm stupid
[1:55:31] <+lynlyn_ow> don't mind me
[1:55:34] <%X2Eliah> Wait so what does the box do?
[1:55:43] <peachy996> I'd like to see a Killer Klow
[1:55:44] <@SoFarFetched> Box stops the chain hunt
[1:55:46] <+InternetShis> Maybe no survivors, but the Flood from Halo as a killer?
[1:55:49] <peachy996> From Outer Space
[1:55:50] <ChrisPlaysThing> let's chains attack
[1:55:54] <%Dakuu75> is it just me, or is Paige's tuber-mouth being twitchy tonight?
[1:56:02] <illTemperedSeaBass> Box teaches you pleasure through pain or some other Slaaneshi shit.
[1:56:14] <%Zeif00> The chain hunt once it starts is really annoying, chains interrupt you constantly
[1:56:17] <ChrisPlaysThing> Don't give Box to Hellraiser
[1:56:20] <+Thesaltt> You have summoned me!  AND I CAME!
[1:56:24] <%radda343> the chain hunt starts if he finds the box first too
[1:56:34] <%NeonLight> :O
[1:56:37] <illTemperedSeaBass> :O
[1:56:37] <+Taisuru> "AND I CAME"
[1:56:38] <@SoFarFetched> sipsipGasm HE CAME sipsipGasm
[1:56:38] <%10deez> :O
[1:56:38] <+lynlyn_ow> LUL
[1:56:41] <%JaydenSai> HE CAME
[1:56:44] <%X2Eliah> LUL
[1:56:46] <+Doomtastic> you look like you're chattering your teeth
[1:56:48] <+Doomtastic> lol
[1:56:48] <mr_saturday93> LUL LUL LUL
[1:56:50] <+InternetShis> :O
[1:56:53] <Faustgesicht> So if some red rank grabs the box early and just holds it hostage, the chain hunt will never start. Hmmm
[1:56:54] <thesugardaddy111> LUL LUL LUL
[1:57:00] <%JaydenSai> Yeah your mouth is doing a weird chattering thing? @PeachSaliva
[1:57:02] <emper0rner0> Your mouth is kinda vibrating yeah
[1:57:03] <vulpuspictus> must be cold
[1:57:04] <+lynlyn_ow> yea mouth twitches LUL
[1:57:04] <+InternetShis> The rigging is very shocked tonight
[1:57:05] <$hrbeck_> In the words of Patuh, ghost dicks
[1:57:05] <peachy996> It is not hands that call him, it is someone fucking up the Generator repair
[1:57:06] <%grapplingwithdepression> Man every time i see someone streaming this game i want to play it but the severe brainworms dont let me play a game without a full roster and the astronomical size of the dlc makes me stay away
[1:57:06] <@SoFarFetched> oh yeah I see now
[1:57:11] <%NeonLight> Now its just constant :O
[1:57:13] <+Doomtastic> maybe you're just that spooked? lol
[1:57:14] <illTemperedSeaBass> You were also stuck O-facing earlier.
[1:57:14] <+Thesaltt> evoKO AND I CAME evoKO
[1:57:16] <alliedmastercompy> Paige is the Chatterer Cenobite
[1:57:17] <+lynlyn_ow> now i can't unsee it LUL
[1:57:19] <%grapplingwithdepression> Also makes getting into fighting games late a nightmare
[1:57:21] <%X2Eliah> Maybe Paige is just very cold
[1:57:24] <%Monkeyweed21> you could always rebrand from fox to goldfish and make it a gimmick
[1:57:28] <@Jekado> maybe your vtuber is scared
[1:57:29] <tanarath> Paige just does mouth things unconiously, it's fine.
[1:57:31] <ChrisPlaysThing> Is the rig set to lipsync on mic pickup or from visual tracking?
[1:57:34] <%mckraven> @illtemperedseabass cenobites are actually really similar to the Dark Eldar
[1:57:37] <whiskey8822> yeah, mostly it's the perpetual O-face
[1:57:41] <spongeofmystery> You're not, one of the cenobites is called the Chatterer
[1:57:44] <@SoFarFetched> Paige's V-tuber is putting the BITE in Cenobite geefPlz
[1:57:45] <%bevyrage> it's likely low lighting or the camera needs to be cleaned
[1:57:46] <cureneckbeard> picking up poorly due to poor lighting maybe
[1:57:47] <+InternetShis> Paige is Pop Cat
[1:57:50] <+InternetShis> Pop Fox
[1:57:52] <hearingthenseeing> it's nice and cool in Ontario currently
[1:57:55] <peachy996> How long until they put Candyman in I wonder
[1:58:00] <cureneckbeard> remember when pat had his camera set to 480p by mistake for like a year
[1:58:01] <+Thesaltt> @SoFarFetched I get it!
[1:58:01] <%JaydenSai> Actually one of the Cenobites is 'The Chatterer' so, you're in character! @PeachSaliva
[1:58:03] <illTemperedSeaBass> @mckraven The deldar? That's subjectively even worse than the Slaaneshi cultists! WutFace
[1:58:06] <+Taisuru> Is there a survivor with Pinhead? What do their perks do?
[1:58:09] <%NeonLight> HE CAME
[1:58:12] <$NitronStreams> He CAME
[1:58:16] <@SoFarFetched> @Taisuru just Pinhead
[1:58:17] <%JaydenSai> HE CAME!
[1:58:17] <+Thesaltt> evoKO AND I CAME evoKO
[1:58:19] <+DazedCookies> HE CAME
[1:58:25] <@SoFarFetched> sipsipGasm HE CAME sipsipGasm
[1:58:27] <+Doomtastic> he came? ayo? YOU NEED TO LEAVE
[1:58:28] <ChrisPlaysThing> If the rig is set for visual tracking lighting could be it, if it's set for audio it could be the game audio is too loud and being picked up by the mic
[1:58:30] <+InternetShis> HE CAME
[1:58:42] <President_Pariah> i clapped when he came
[1:58:43] <majorpeppy> do you have dark lipstick on? that might be messing with what the cam picks up? idk
[1:58:43] <$AzureGale> nyannBlush
[1:58:45] <%maskofmichael> He Came on Paige. To Paige. On Paige?
[1:58:47] <%CubicPhantom> you failed to solve his torture sudoku
[1:58:51] <+ALazo> Kreygasm
[1:58:53] <%10deez> Is the movie Hellraiser any good?
[1:58:56] <eccentricpersona> YES, DBD content is what i live for
[1:58:59] <+skm742> Those chains look like they feel like walking into a spiderweb.
[1:59:02] <peachy996> I like the way he carries you. Very fitting to his character
[1:59:03] <spongeofmystery> aw man he picks you up with chains? that's so COOL
[1:59:05] <eccentricpersona> *Paige DBD Content
[1:59:07] <+TopTieramisu> the first 2 hellraisers
[1:59:10] <%NeonLight> Yugi solves the Puzzle and summons Pinhead
[1:59:11] <ChrisPlaysThing> Torture Rubik's Cube
[1:59:14] <+TopTieramisu> don't watch any more than those
[1:59:16] <AFlyingTaco1> First two are great
[1:59:17] <+InternetShis> The Shadow Puzzle
[1:59:17] <%grapplingwithdepression> The one with the dvd player cenobite gets me every time
[1:59:18] <+the_mental_punk> @10deez yes the first 2 are very lovecraftian I just watched them this weekend
[1:59:18] <+SWFanatic> Francish!
[1:59:20] <%X2Eliah> @NeonLight yoooooooo
[1:59:22] <peachy996> Hellraiser is good, the second one is not AS good but still really good
[1:59:22] <+Thesaltt> 2 out of 11 are pretty cool
[1:59:23] <+SWFanatic> Louish!
[1:59:31] <%10deez> Nice
[1:59:32] <peachy996> Hellraiser 2 has some great quotes
[1:59:34] <+Ynkubus_> Watch 1,2,3 after that take em or leave em
[1:59:34] <tanarath> Bill-uh
[1:59:34] <+Taisuru> lolbill
[1:59:40] <StebTheVee> Jesus wept
[1:59:45] <+TopTieramisu> face explodes
[1:59:48] <+Thesaltt> There's like, 10 of them
[1:59:51] <%Agami23> im a slut for crazy good practical effects. might watch it tommorow
[1:59:52] <eccentricpersona> watched that movie when i was 9, shouldnt have done that
[1:59:52] <peachy996> Hellraiser 2 has my favorite line about wanting to see the afterlife
[1:59:54] <%grapplingwithdepression> Dont forget the super sick hellraiser comics
[2:00:01] <peachy996> "You wanted to know. NOW you know"
[2:00:04] <emper0rner0> I've already seen the first two. I've heard the 3rd one is at least worth watching, is that true?
[2:00:06] <+Taisuru> Can pinhead see the box?
[2:00:10] <%3d_pbandj> Its got a lot of gore. like you must enjoy some real looking gore to have a good time
[2:00:18] <Bravewolf_Braveheart> Scary stream.
[2:00:22] <+the_mental_punk> Pinhead cannot see the box
[2:00:28] <%maskofmichael> If Paige was the star of a Hellraiser movie it would just be a 3 hour film of her trying to solve the box
[2:00:29] <ChrisPlaysThing> bopped
[2:00:32] <eccentricpersona> that intro scene after the guy solved the cube and he appeared just scared the sht out of 9 yr old me
[2:00:33] <%mckraven> you gotta see the hellraiser in space though. if only for the sake of saying you have
[2:00:43] <+Thesaltt> @maskofmichael only 3 hours?
[2:01:03] <+TopTieramisu> pinhead isn't even the worst villain in either of the first 2 movies
[2:01:05] <+Taisuru> Locker LUL
[2:01:06] <%X2Eliah> Creepy good, or creepy bad?
[2:01:14] <Faustgesicht> Man Blendette players are gonna have a field day with this guy
[2:01:16] <ChrisPlaysThing> Is this a new accessibility option that was added? I remeber having to spam the spacebar
[2:01:17] <eccentricpersona> Both
[2:01:23] <%maskofmichael> @maskofmichael It's a HEAVYLY edited film
[2:01:25] <%X2Eliah> Because "creepy" can mean some really gross bayou domestic abuse sh*t
[2:01:29] <eccentricpersona> nah i think thats the default now
[2:01:43] <StebTheVee> The more you think about it, the frightening Pinhead and cenobites are. They kill you, you go straight to hell.
[2:01:44] <%grapplingwithdepression> Its sorta torture pornish ngl
[2:01:50] <eccentricpersona> i didnt have to switch it, its just QTEs now
[2:01:55] <+Taisuru> Wet creepy
[2:02:01] <%NeonLight> did anyone even like spamming spacebar?
[2:02:03] <+TopTieramisu> i mean the cenobites believe pain is joy
[2:02:08] <peachy996> Sorta but not indulgent on the torture porn like other movies
[2:02:09] <vulpuspictus> scary creepy not One Hour Photo creepy
[2:02:11] <sydowoodo> why paige
[2:02:15] <AFlyingTaco1> Like spooky creepy, not awful human stuff creepy
[2:02:15] <$NitronStreams> HE CAME
[2:02:18] <emper0rner0> Its BDSM horror the movie
[2:02:18] <%JaydenSai> HE CAME
[2:02:19] <illTemperedSeaBass> HE CAME
[2:02:21] <eccentricpersona> its way better than the Nightmare on Elm Street reboot
[2:02:25] <+Thesaltt> evoMindblown AND HE CAME! evoMindblown
[2:02:25] <%X2Eliah> @vulpuspictus Ok thank you that's waht I wanted to know :)
[2:02:28] <+Taisuru> I'm surprised he isn't slower after teleporting
[2:02:32] <%3d_pbandj> @grapplingwithdepression very true...I mean that's the point of solving the box right? to get IN on the torture porn?
[2:02:40] <+panik96> 2d Paige is kinda cute not gonna lie
[2:02:43] <illTemperedSeaBass> Quick, crawl to the hatch!
[2:02:43] <mr_saturday93> You were over the pallet that's bs
[2:02:44] <keemii_don> "He said come and he came"
[2:02:58] <keemii_don> peeping tom is creepy glorySuffer
[2:02:58] <AFlyingTaco1> Vile, sickening
[2:03:02] <%CubicPhantom> that's valid
[2:03:03] <StebTheVee> dmostetic abuse is disturbing
[2:03:05] <peachy996> Hellraiser and Hellbound has so many great quotes that are memorable to me
[2:03:15] <%mckraven> domestic abuse stuff is more upsetting and sickening than creepy
[2:03:17] <peachy996> Probably the most out of any horror movie
[2:03:19] <eccentricpersona> Ive never actually looked closely at ur model but u got HUGE BAZONGAS
[2:03:22] <Bravewolf_Braveheart> Pinhead is just relentlessly killing peach.
[2:03:25] <+the_mental_punk> Is the movie hot?
[2:03:29] <%Drowsy_Tuna> LUL LUL
[2:03:32] <spongeofmystery> "We have such sights to show you"
[2:03:37] <+Taisuru> Pat and gief eating paige's food
[2:03:38] <+glgzephyr> the idea that these characters can survive getting hooked once never stops being ridiculous
[2:03:42] <$AzureGale> Won't be good, I'm sure
[2:03:43] <+SWFanatic> #FoodConcerned
[2:03:54] <peachy996> "We have eternity to know your flesh"
[2:03:55] <$NitronStreams> Its 10pm do you know where your food is?
[2:03:57] <$hrbeck_> Yeah, hellraiser has a LOT more dialog than the usual horror movie
[2:04:09] <%10deez> Hellraiser's trailer looks good! I see where the demons from Mandy get their inspiration
[2:04:28] <M0untain_wolf> FOOD missing
[2:04:34] <peachyprimrose> Just got here, how's it been so far?
[2:04:40] <%X2Eliah> @glgzephyr that's kind of a horror movie trope
[2:04:41] <MinusGix> the hooking is the easy part, the Labyrinth is the more worrying place to be
[2:04:45] <Bravewolf_Braveheart> 404 food not found?
[2:04:47] <%X2Eliah> @peachyprimrose creepy
[2:04:56] <peachy996> I think the one problem with the sequel is they drop the ball near the end but it's still really good.
[2:05:02] <eccentricpersona> @x2eliah but creepy good or creepy bad
[2:05:05] <%mckraven> @glgzephyr apparently there's lore that explains. something about the dark entity running the game feeding off pain and keeping them going forever
[2:05:07] <%X2Eliah> LUL
[2:05:24] <vulpuspictus> @peachyprimrose We found jesus
[2:05:45] <peachy996> But if you don't like the later hellraiser movies, it's a good place to end
[2:06:19] <+SWFanatic> wahwah
[2:06:25] <+whyskeywolfe> welcome back
[2:06:29] <1stDove> wah chenzBlep

[2:06:48] <+whyskeywolfe> just chatting is good
[2:06:48] <%mckraven> I dont mind
[2:06:48] <spongeofmystery> @mckraven also the Entity makes the killer unnaturally strong, which is how smaller ones like the Pig or Legion are able to one-arm an adult up to head height
[2:06:50] <%Dakuu75> it's fine
[2:06:50] <@SoFarFetched> Do chatting
[2:06:51] <sydowoodo> we can't even see you

[2:07:38] <%Dakuu75> @PeachSaliva is this like "eat on stream or end the stream?" (w/e the "don't end the stream" option is.)
[2:07:41] <benjiFG> :o
