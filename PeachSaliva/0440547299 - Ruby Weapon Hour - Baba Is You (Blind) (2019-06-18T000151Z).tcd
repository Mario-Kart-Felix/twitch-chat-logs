Would you consider playing the old school version or remake in a future play? I figure you pick Kevin as your main because he becomes a werewolf furry warrior when night falls. Enjoy the game Heavy Mustard Machine Gun Peach and Rocket Elmo Launcher Pat.

[1:39:11] <+megaotter> oh, i got it now
[1:39:11] <$GoogleyGareth> Eventually, Paige stopped thinking...
[1:39:13] <$happyface699> FALLING AWAY FROM ME
[1:39:14] <TheZillex> Brain is Stop

[1:39:17] <$birdfella> Please
[1:39:17] <%crimsonharvest> just push the word into the jelly
[1:39:18] <3xgilly> i think i figured it out
[1:39:18] <Louie_Salmon> @run44forrest You just literally push anything into a jellyfish and then walk in
[1:39:19] <worldbrand> AND I'M ABOUT TO BREAK
[1:39:19] <TaciturnEngine> Text goes before textbox
[1:39:19] <$mrhooppaw> @run44forrest push a word onto a jelly. itll sink and disappear. flag is available
[1:39:19] <Tyrannus_Natas> This chat is great
[1:39:19] <dukenux> I've become so SINK
[1:39:20] <+HotBloodedHero> Wall and Baba is You
[1:39:21] <$luka_etoile> Man I wonder what she could push into a jelly.
[1:39:21] <%GeneralSCPatton> Remember what you did when WATER WAS SINK?
[1:39:22] <ProRJHunter> This music is good
[1:39:22] <Ion_Laser> I'VE BECOME SO TIRED
[1:39:23] <%Admiral_PopnFresh> Can't move Stop?

[1:39:25] <+gespenst25> THERE's only one rthing you can do?
[1:39:25] <$Mendin> There are two main solutions here
[1:39:26] <ExpressNode> Paint is dump
[1:39:27] <GodlikeFool> Im confused now
[1:39:28] <Mesonoxian_Methuselah> CUT MY LIFE INTO PIECES
[1:39:29] <sosandstorm> this shallow breathing I'm doing isn't helping either
[1:39:33] <Dragon_Batman> That and tho
[1:39:33] <+HellfireComms> Baba Is Jelly
[1:39:34] <$SWFanatic> apatLiz AND apatGoblin IS apatFist
[1:39:35] <InsomniacPersona> if only something could tank the jellies
[1:39:36] <Run44forrest> oh ok yeah i thought she tried that already
[1:39:38] <SGrim> @dukenux that's good rooPog
[1:39:38] <%galaxyswirl> this is my last RESORT
[1:39:38] <Smart_ZaK1> THIS IS MY LAST RESORT
[1:39:39] <%AncelDeLambert> I am surprised taht there are two solutions
[1:39:40] <$Mendin> both involve understanding what SINK does
[1:39:40] <evbites> someone do a time comparison between her and woolie
[1:39:40] <ShadeTheNovice> Oh I think she might have it
[1:39:40] <spiritofmojave> I'm still comfy despite this frustration, music is good
[1:39:42] <+gespenst25> WHY

[1:39:53] <+megaotter> there are a couple solutions, actually
[1:39:54] <%duneblythe> kill jelly
[1:39:54] <ColRedyx> Fuck it. I'm pretty sure the answer is "Wall and Baba is You" because objects can only sink one other object.

[1:42:00] <ColRedyx> There's no priority between stop or sink guys, stop just prevents you from entering the tile so you wouldn't be able to sink anyway.

[1:42:09] <Zathas> This is actually just incredibly depressing. How can God allow such a travesty to exist in this pure world. Paige's mother should be ascended to Sainthood for having raised this miraclulous mustard goblin.

[3:36:28] <+AlwaysBeGaming> LUL
[3:36:29] <garbageheaphound> key is you
[3:36:31] <+steelzaru> @Graxe_ painful
[3:36:32] <dickbuttwoman> Need to be SHUT to be Opened
[3:36:32] <crimsonsaens> Go back to when you became the Door
[3:36:33] <+krispen_wa> key is you
[3:36:33] <spawnzie> the hedge would stop the words right
[3:36:34] <+megaotter> ok i got it
[3:36:36] <+ThatGuyfromMars> does paige even know what she's doing
[3:36:38] <Fujiwara_92> DOOR IS NOT SHUT
[3:36:39] <+BinaryForest> The fact that she stranded an Is in an unmovable spot is gonna cause problems
[3:36:42] <spiritofmojave> Brain is die
[3:36:42] <Louie_Salmon> You're too attached to the idea of a real life door being shut and a real life key opening it
[3:36:43] <AlmondRoll> never mind, I see a way to salvage this
[3:36:44] <fIashman92> Bunch of ways to do this
[3:36:46] <%Admiral_PopnFresh> Key is you
[3:36:46] <+mmSoTasty> the key was in a different spot before
[3:36:48] <Lewin_Godwynn> So I get home and see a shitload of Paige memes on Twitter what glory did I miss and was it clipped?
[3:36:48] <dezik45> Key is You
[3:36:49] <%GeneralSCPatton> Dammit, she's trying backwards sentences again
[3:36:50] <alwayspronking> Paige is Crash
[3:36:51] <+JenovasPuppet> PAIGE STUCK
[3:36:54] <BlueSpartan119> key is shut, door is open?
[3:36:57] <fIashman92> Key is Keke or Keke is Door
[3:36:59] <Smart_ZaK1> Key is shut
[3:37:01] <%Roasted_Pheasant> Keke is Screwed onto big dick and used as a cocksleeve
[3:37:01] <ShadeTheNovice> There are two ways to solve this
[3:37:02] <$gamewarden92> Darkseid is
[3:37:04] <PrettyThickandStrongDyck> Paige is not crash
[3:37:09] <+MakotoPB> set up IS beforehand so you can make Key is You
[3:37:11] <+krispen_wa> The way is shut
[3:37:14] <+Rolandknight> Key is you
[3:37:15] <+megaotter> Make Keke a Door too, Make door shut, kamikaze one door into key then you can make flag win
[3:37:16] <crimsonsaens> @Lewin_Godwynn A lot of it was clipped
[3:37:17] <PrettyThickandStrongDyck> Paige is unbreakable

[3:37:29] <+MonsieurHedge> why cant baba just be baba man
[3:37:30] <+twohitgood> that would turn keke to key

[3:40:24] <$FrustratedAF> this is gonna end up the last one isn't it?
[3:40:25] <Dr_Mooose> maybe 1 more LUL

[3:40:30] <+linSP> this is still like the first world of like 10
[3:40:31] <axelcezar> this one is about the X is X again
[3:40:35] <spiritofmojave> Yeah maybe just this lmao
[3:40:35] <+sora8745> 🦀 $11 btw 🦀
[3:40:35] <+MonsieurHedge> the trick to this one is affirming your self-worth
[3:40:37] <Valdorick> Baba is in open relationship
[3:40:38] <+OctaivianRex> This is 100% the last one.
[3:40:46] <MetroidSlayerP7> Paige's brain has been running overclocked for too long. Needs liquid metal thermal interface material.
[3:40:48] <%Roasted_Pheasant> But what is win
[3:40:49] <+mmSoTasty> this game looks pretty cool, I'll have to look into it
[3:40:51] <omen_setter> ez pz
[3:40:51] <deafmutelaughing> why can't Baba open the door
[3:40:52] <+JenovasPuppet> Baba is Win!
[3:40:54] <$RC_S3kshun8> can you just do BaBa is Win lol @PeachSaliva
[3:40:58] <+AlwaysBeGaming> WutFace
[3:41:00] <DedlokPM> BABA is OPEN for anything. teenB
[3:41:01] <ooblag> Rgis is pretty simple
[3:41:04] <%Roasted_Pheasant> @deafmutelaughing because door is shut
[3:41:10] <spawnzie> But if you Baba is Win Baba is defeat first
[3:41:11] <AlmondRoll> Ah, I see it
[3:41:11] <leviathan666303> i solved it
[3:41:11] <TheIncoherentGamer> Finish first level
[3:41:12] <Valdorick> But for baba to is win, baba must is defeat
[3:41:13] <%Roasted_Pheasant> And stop
[3:41:17] <wheke_> @PlagueOfGripes so baba is porn? soon?
[3:41:20] <$FrustratedAF> i might have gotten it???
[3:41:23] <$RC_S3kshun8> OH just do Crab is Win!
[3:41:26] <deafmutelaughing> but Open means you can open the door doesn't it? or am I wrong @Roasted_Pheasant
[3:41:29] <+Nobrev> @RC_S3kshun8 you have to get past baba is defeat to do that
[3:41:30] <leviathan666303> flag is push and open, then crab is win
[3:41:33] <ooblag> You eventually want Crab to be win, so you the Flag as a key
[3:41:34] <+JenovasPuppet> Would Baba is Defeat even count if Baba isn't something else as well?
[3:41:35] <%galaxyswirl> solved it
[3:41:39] <gyro_gogo_zeppeli> Pat will die
[3:41:40] <+badchoice5> Look to Jesus, Paige, he has all the answers you could ever need
[3:41:43] <$SWFanatic> Elmo IS Stop
[3:41:44] <TheLakinessMonster> Chat becomes more illegible with Baba is You speak
[3:41:46] <$FrustratedAF> you get the crab and the flag and you push them up so one is the win and i'm assuming paige doesn't see chat tonight
[3:41:48] <%Roasted_Pheasant> @deafmutelaughing it's because door is also stop. door cannot open because door cannot be entered
[3:41:49] <+bubblebasspickles> RIP Pat

[4:17:39] <filialpails> that prank show is the exact reason why we can't disarm the workers
[4:17:40] <xmetalicdemonx> I hate prank shows that mess with normal people.
[4:17:40] <%MightyMaxT> Wait. They're pranking people with JOB OFFERS?!
[4:17:41] <+badchoice5> Pranking the unemployed is pure evil
[4:17:41] <$Kataguro> That is a foolish hope
[4:17:42] <Run44forrest> hahahahah PERISH
[4:17:42] <Kratok> "Pranked you, nothing happened"
[4:17:48] <$TeraMercier> But then it's just pageantry for someone being crushed in their hopes
[4:17:48] <+Forente> that is cruel if true
[4:17:48] <Kratok> ITS PURE EVIL
[4:17:53] <%Faustgesicht> Kids gonna get assaulted
[4:17:55] <+DukeMoose> the tooth gap kid from Stranger Things is getting a show where they prank poor people. explicitly poor
[4:17:56] <+TheShal> That kid is gonna be known as the Fat Evil
[4:17:58] <%MrSuperCasualBoom> That kid must be all smiles....wait.
[4:18:00] <+Xeno351> 100 percent as bad as it sounds
[4:18:02] <+BruceyG> I'm out of the loop, why is it evil?
[4:18:03] <tadaoismad> IT'S A JOB but actually I'm going to train you to the best job ever
[4:18:05] <indig0bird> Even if he's a kid hired by a huge company, that's not defensible
[4:18:08] <Zaphire_Saucypants> fake fuckin job offers. Poor kid
[4:18:11] <indig0bird> In any fucking way
[4:18:11] <+Despera__> At best hopefully they give them like $5000 and set them up with a job search service
[4:18:14] <%Roasted_Pheasant> @DukeMoose ah. well yeah. that's uhhhh. no.
[4:18:19] <+Mekhet09> that sucks.
[4:18:21] <Ion_Laser> @MrSuperCasualBoom Kappa

[4:18:31] <$Kataguro> Like it's legit just twisting the knife in people down on their luck. HOPEFULLY it's not the worst
[4:18:35] <+badchoice5> As a recent member of the unemployed (for like 9 months), fake job offers is one of the worst things I've ever heard of
[4:18:38] <%MrSuperCasualBoom> @ion_laser 🤷♀️😬
[4:18:40] <Zaphire_Saucypants> and his parents slapped in the face for letting it happen

[4:18:46] <tadaoismad> I hope it's not
[4:18:46] <Kratok> Is giving them 5000 even worth it?
[4:18:49] <$rdark_ksu> ITs not so bad cause at the end you get to suplex the child

[4:20:45] <+Sir_Gawain_Lotsson> ***
[4:20:45] <$Agami23> when you guys first went out, didnt you think pat accidentally missed the trashcan when he was littering?
[4:20:47] <indig0bird> I don't think the kid's to blame, because even if he was the sole creator of the whole show, IN a huge company full of people doing all sorts of jobs NO ONE SAID NO
[4:20:49] <+Flambage> @PeachSaliva How far does this large penis hit?
[4:20:50] <cureneckbeard> I'm laughing for real at "It is a Canadian custom"

[4:32:32] <+TONYOO101> The lupus kills the rabies
[4:32:35] <ShichiNoBushi> Does the lupus counter it?
[4:32:38] <Dr_Mooose> it's scary
[4:32:39] <$Sphincter_Spelunker> Possums are. Paige aren't
[4:32:41] <%starotter70> If she already has them...
[4:32:43] <TheLakinessMonster> She doesn't know rabies because she is immune
[4:32:45] <faegbeard> it's like that thing with Mr Burns where all the diseases are trying to get through the door
[4:32:46] <leviathan666303> lupus counters rabies
[4:32:50] <+SoarFlyer> no it's once symptoms show
[4:32:54] <King_Wolf_Rigger> Well, if you catch it fast enough you'll be okay.
[4:32:54] <DarbyV> Lupus is a hard counter
[4:32:56] <$RubberFistFight> if you catch rabies AND IT GOES UNTREATED - you're definitely dead.
[4:32:57] <Valdorick> Rabies Rights!
[4:32:59] <+Kairi__> Elmo lowkey plotting to murder his humans
[4:33:01] <$RubberFistFight> but it's easy to treat.

[4:33:12] <Luesagna00> @peachsaliva yeah cure for that
[4:33:12] <Run44forrest> so if i have rabies i just have to contract Lupus>

[4:33:13] <Drick_> you can get treated for rabies with a ton of shots in your belly
[4:33:18] <Drick_> rather, cured

[4:36:06] <$RubberFistFight> @MasterDecoder I know, but it's always fun informing people who still think it's the worst thing ever. Like it's still a shitty disease, but it's a practical non-issue for developed nations, but thanks to the history people still think it's a world-ender.

[4:39:00] <$RubberFistFight> @PeachSaliva I get what Pat is saying, it's egregious and excessive. Thing is, people like us don't think the same way as people like that.
