[0:00:25] <%nip_nips> hello today
[0:01:00] <darklion125> what is yalls favorite soup
[0:01:07] <@PatStaresAt> hello today also
[0:01:07] <%nip_nips> whiskey
[0:01:20] <+wmeldrum> soup! chimpken
[0:01:24] <%GojiraKira> hallo
[0:01:37] <+wmeldrum> I hope you're all happy and well
[0:01:54] <+RealThiele> paige AND toilet-chan. truly we are blessed
[0:02:23] <Hellbound235> dazeOogabooga
[0:02:24] <darklion125> eh my wife quit a job she just started cus they increase the insurance every year because you get older
[0:02:41] <anfiilookinsgood> WAH
[0:02:43] <darklion125> which seems like a dumb af thing to do
[0:02:53] <%femto216> Yaaaay
[0:03:00] <%cade_calrayn> y'all ready to see Paige wipe the floor with Friede in the first 20 minutes?
[0:03:04] <darklion125> that and it isnt even good insurance
[0:03:13] <%cade_calrayn> that is if chat doesn't backseat her off the stream again
[0:03:14] <+RealThiele> older people have more health problems so insurance has gotta gouge as hard as they can before you die
[0:03:27] <%KeiganOfAstora> @cade_calrayn I think it was more her hands to be honest
[0:03:28] <%nip_nips> watch her just crush it first try tonight
[0:03:30] <Treasure_Vault> She'll be at midir in an hour.
[0:03:31] <SpaceManHotepIV> hullo today
[0:03:47] <cipher758> hello today wah wah
[0:03:47] <+Bailey__gaming> I really love this  ore active Peach Streams
[0:03:50] <anfiilookinsgood> hahaha
[0:03:57] <ToneBacas> @cade_calrayn she'll beat her on her first try of the stream and move on to the second DLC
[0:04:02] <+SimplesRock> Hi all! How is everyone evening?
[0:04:11] <anfiilookinsgood> will she summon Gael?
[0:04:13] <darklion125> yea but if you have insurance through a company they should not be charging $800 a week to insure someone in thier 50s
[0:04:18] <anfiilookinsgood> or solo
[0:04:18] <TurtlesAndTentacles> she didn't even say she was proud of us last night 😔
[0:04:19] <%KeiganOfAstora> Midir is gonna take awhile. First is the Old Demon Prince and Demon In Pain. That's a tough fight if she's not gonna summon NPC help
[0:04:27] <darklion125> especially if the job pays $15
[0:04:38] <+RealThiele> oh yeah insurance is mostly a scam
[0:04:51] <%cade_calrayn> Pat will go nuclear with salt and envy at the ease with which Paige handles the Ringed City
[0:05:02] <%JoshManVGH> @darklion125 That sounds like a company that isn't PROVIDING health insurance, so much as signing employees up for it.
[0:05:02] <~PeachSaliva> @TurtlesAndTentacles yes i did silly!
[0:05:18] <%Puhff> For Paige, it is...ENBIGGENING TIME!
[0:05:21] <%cade_calrayn> *gasp* hi Paige!
[0:05:22] <TurtlesAndTentacles> @peachsaliva How did I miss it! I'm sorry! I'm not worthy!
[0:05:31] <%That1blindkid> Im just here for the food
[0:05:36] <%cade_calrayn> she is listening and thus she sees all
[0:05:44] <%cade_calrayn> for if you hear, you see
[0:05:46] <darklion125> @JoshManVGH yea she just told them she wasnt going to come in anymore which is good
[0:05:51] <%nip_nips> im just here to watch paige murder women
[0:05:52] <+RealThiele> paige can only power one sense at a time
[0:05:55] <TurtlesAndTentacles> alright chat today we will all be kind and chill.
[0:05:56] <anfiilookinsgood> im here for the SHADOW PUZZLES
[0:05:59] <+Bailey__gaming> Hey Paige
[0:06:13] <+MisterAvry> hello!
[0:06:14] <+Archphronimos> So how BIG AND HUGE is Paige going to be tonight? Yesterday was ridiculous
[0:06:22] <+MisterAvry> she's gonna beat Friede
[0:06:24] <%GalacticaPhanto> Can't wait for another stream where chat has shit takes
[0:06:24] <%nip_nips> @anfiilookinsgood shes gonna have a good time with the shadow puzzles in the ringed city
[0:06:26] <+MisterAvry> for one
[0:06:27] <+Bailey__gaming> Hehe I'm so happy people love SHADOW Puzzzl3w
[0:06:35] <+MooseIsGoose> woot she gonna get that woman
[0:06:44] <jetpack_rorschasch> If chat were shitty the last time, I'm sure they've learned their lesson. So let's be positive for Paige tonight guys! SeemsGood
[0:06:44] <anfiilookinsgood> LUL LUL
[0:06:45] <@MistyMntns> Hellooooo Everyone
[0:06:49] <DianaTheAscian> I'm surprised she didn't go with the dark set to wear the whole game
[0:07:07] <+RealThiele> Dancer has that phat ass doe
[0:07:10] <%Puhff> I have learned no lessons and Imme be real toxic tonight Keepo
[0:07:21] <DianaTheAscian> but skeleton though
[0:07:24] <+MisterAvry> I think we didn't quite convey that tracking her down while invisible is like, free hits.
[0:07:27] <+Archphronimos> I believe in you Paige! Kick that ancient cripple and woman's asses
[0:07:29] <Coystick> Time to kill a woman and bully birds in the name of art
[0:07:29] <missingangle> Chat we should only be the typical level of toxic tonight. Not gamer level toxic. C'mon you all know better.
[0:07:37] <%JobbedBone> ye I'm sorry if I contributed, didn't realize what was intended to be snark would come off as so antagonistic BibleThump
[0:07:38] <BigFingerRo> My oh my, Peach sure is giving us an embarassment of content lately!
[0:07:47] <%nip_nips> @DianaTheAscian is that the skinman outfit?
[0:07:52] <+Bailey__gaming> I love this Tune
[0:07:55] <cipher758> are u ready to laugh
[0:07:56] <peachy996> I'll be jumping between streams so in case I miss it, I hereby donate all of my "kill fictional nun" energy to Paige.
[0:08:00] <%Sotetsu> It's the Ruby Weapon Hour! sipsipDab
[0:08:13] <peachy996> Kill the woman, you ginger Terminator made of glass
[0:08:15] <BigFingerRo> @missingangle You can hold back if you want, I'm turning off my Intel Bleep filters tonight!
[0:08:15] <%Reaped_Psyche> This song is so fuckin hype.
[0:08:28] <DianaTheAscian> @nip_nips its the set dark wraiths drop
[0:08:38] <+RealThiele> spider dance and death report are my top 2 of UT
[0:08:40] <anfiilookinsgood> darkness
[0:08:40] <Coystick> Actually, is sis Freide or Ariandel vulnerable to toxic? She has all those Dung Pies
[0:08:40] <%nip_nips> yeah thats the skinman cosplay
[0:08:51] <devanmuse> did she defeat Friede last night? or is that item one on the agenda?
[0:08:56] <%GabeSweetMan> Time for Peach to TOTALLY ONE SHOT FRIEDA. No pressure. Believe in the Unga Bunga.
[0:09:07] <%nip_nips> @devanmuse its where we begin tonight
[0:09:07] <%GabeSweetMan> Friende is item one @devanmuse
[0:09:18] <anfiilookinsgood> Friede all Omaewa mo shinderu
[0:09:20] <BigFingerRo> @Coystick Cmon man, do you honestly think that's a good strategy for this specific boss?
[0:09:32] <%nip_nips> throwing doodoo is always a good strategy
[0:09:39] <benjiFG> more like sus friede
[0:09:42] <BigFingerRo> especially when unga bunga has proven to be so effective!
[0:09:49] <%PrincessAlex23> PrincessAlex23 subscribed with Prime. They've subscribed for 8 months! Hello today Peach, good luck adding yet another VVymyn to your death toll tonight.  Freide will never know what hit her.
[0:09:49] <%freelancebabymaker> i think paige is just gonna have to unga bunga until she wins
[0:09:51] <%GabeSweetMan> Forget Strategy, Return to Bunga
[0:09:58] <DianaTheAscian> i missed last stream did she beat nameless?
[0:10:00] <%GalacticaPhanto> more like Poop Friede
[0:10:04] <+Bailey__gaming> D A N C I N G !!
[0:10:10] <%levimonstapaws> Hello today!
[0:10:11] <%hewlettfan96> What a day
[0:10:13] <+Anderobot> She beat nameless a while ago
[0:10:20] <Coystick> @BigFingerRo for Ariandel phase yes, he's a big slow target and would be a good source of damage ticks
[0:10:24] <BigFingerRo> @freelancebabymaker So just stay the course
[0:10:31] <peachy996> @DianaTheAscian She did
[0:10:34] <%freelancebabymaker> unga bunga did really well on her first try and chat advice wasnt really helping her
[0:10:41] <%hkazu_> hkazu_ subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 24 months, currently on a 24 month streak! Damn 2 years tho… time flies
[0:10:44] <DianaTheAscian> @peachy996 k
[0:10:51] <%freelancebabymaker> @BigFingerRo pretty much yeah
[0:10:54] <BigFingerRo> @Coystick That could be a plan, if the pie dungs were infinite, like with a spell or something
[0:10:58] <@MistyMntns> psaBig sipsipDab
[0:10:58] <%GalacticaPhanto> I think forgot to translate the help into Peach Speak
[0:11:08] <%GabeSweetMan> She was already sundowning so the info wasn't absorbing. Presumably coming at this fresh will help her start internalizing the patterns.
[0:11:10] <dejaymc> heyy
[0:11:15] <%hewlettfan96> Paige sure let a lot of grotesque enemies last time
[0:11:18] <+Bailey__gaming> L O O P Z
[0:11:30] <%hewlettfan96> sipsipHellmo sipsipHellmo sipsipHellmo
[0:11:37] <BigFingerRo> How many attempts have we seen so far of friede?
[0:11:42] <%Ziegsy> IM HERE
[0:11:42] <%nip_nips> not many yet
[0:11:44] <%GabeSweetMan> Like 7 or so?
[0:11:50] <+Archphronimos> She did crazy well last night, I honestly didn't see any sundowning. Just seems like chat being really negative
[0:11:50] <%Ziegsy> and intime for intro!
[0:11:52] <%freelancebabymaker> a decent amount
[0:11:54] <%hewlettfan96> I literally came into the stream albeit like 2 mins before it was gonna end
[0:11:56] <%GalacticaPhanto> Rather Pat didn't translate the advice to Peach Speak
[0:11:57] <peachy996> She is a Terminator made of Glass   spray painted in Gold
[0:12:20] <anfiilookinsgood> this boss fight is just HARD
[0:12:24] <%JobbedBone> lets leave it in the past. Just excited to watch today!
[0:12:34] <peachy996> She did amazing the first time, then once the advice came in she faltered. But that happens in souls games
[0:12:37] <AthenaAegis> @peachy996 LMAO EleGiggle
[0:12:39] <%JobbedBone> rooBobble
[0:12:39] <BigFingerRo> So, we should make our best effort to overcrowd peach with advice and stress her out!
[0:12:49] <+Bailey__gaming> I was feeling really sad till the music started
[0:12:52] <peachy996> Sometimes your amazing first shot can get in your head.
[0:12:53] <BigFingerRo> I see, I can roll with that
[0:13:05] <%GabeSweetMan> The REAL skill she's shown is a result of her being consistent with her schedule so she's been incredible at maintaining her momentum tbh.
[0:13:09] <%nip_nips> the first run is often the best one before your actual successful run
[0:13:17] <peachy996> And you get frustrated when every attempt afterwards isn't as good
[0:13:22] <%samTUMZfestival> Vtube Paige is so much fun :)
[0:13:23] <%JoshManVGH> Meeerow
[0:13:23] <peachy996> Happens to me with Maria

[0:14:30] <%GabeSweetMan> Well remember also that as Paige's skill to knowledge ratio is inverse to all of humanity so we must instead do what we can to empty her of knowledge so that she can return to UNGA.

[0:21:50] <%JoshManVGH> 13 has some cool music...
[0:21:52] <%Reaped_Psyche> Tactics best, but you numbered fans never wanna talk about that.
[0:21:52] <blue8moon> 8 needs a remake just to give it a chance to make sense LUL
[0:21:53] <%g0atmeal> are you gonna try ff16 when it comes out?
[0:21:54] <+I4gotmyname89> 14?
[0:21:54] <+Ne1son> 13 is bad and people should feel bad about it
[0:21:55] <silverpoyozo> the music in 13 and 13-2 is pretty good
[0:21:57] <%Monkeyweed21> FF13 is the realm of darkness in FF14
[0:21:58] <%JoshManVGH> And.... uh...
[0:21:59] <islandsunn> cartoon eating sfx
[0:21:59] <%GabeSweetMan> Tactics GOAT

[0:22:00] <%mikehuntis4timmy> its good its a straight line for line 30 hrs then opens up
[0:22:03] <%king_wragles> Man, the model looks SO weird when you eat lmao
[0:22:07] <%JobbedBone> None of the ones with a central romance hold up Kappa fite me

[0:22:17] <%optimasmaximas> yeeeeeesh
[0:22:17] <%levimonstapaws> haruchiSuffer
[0:22:18] <%SveriSageAdvice> 14 has managed to make me cry more times than any other game i've played, its ridiculous
[0:22:19] <%JoshManVGH> Scissoring Motercycle Shiva?
[0:22:20] <%FacetiousAF> no its not tho???
[0:22:20] <%Ziegsy> The remake gave sephiroth a booty swagger so is by default the best game ever.
[0:22:22] <anfiilookinsgood> don't mess with all 2 of us
[0:22:25] <%optimasmaximas> 10 lol
[0:22:31] <%RealThiele> HA HA HA HA HA HA
[0:22:32] <%king_wragles> @sean2946 Probably an easy fight sipsipDab
[0:22:32] <@MelBrooksKA> Lulu hot
[0:22:32] <%Agami23> final fantasy 10 is good for a persons first RPG
[0:22:33] <%BoxNavy> no one likes 3 remake jermaPluto
[0:22:35] <%GabeSweetMan> It's great, but not the best. Still one of the strongest battle systems imo, but fuck the sphere grid.
[0:22:39] <%JoshManVGH> Bleetz Bawl!
[0:22:42] <blue8moon> blitzball sucks big time
[0:22:44] <CanadianAnimatorGuy> I like 3 remake but it's not my fav
[0:22:45] <%Monkeyweed21> yea the cast is hit or miss
[0:22:45] <%Ell1ot> in 10 i like the forced laugh that the japanese voice actor did
[0:22:46] <peachy996> Kimahri is hot to look at but useless
[0:22:46] <+natacalico> i feel like the only crazy person who liked blitzball
[0:22:47] <@SoFarFetched> 10 brought Lulu
[0:22:48] <Madinki> YOU DON'T THE BLITZ BRUDDA?!
[0:22:53] <%g0atmeal> my favorite FF game is kingdom hearts Kappa
[0:23:02] <%Sotetsu> 10 is my second favorite
[0:23:06] <%MoonObscure> LULUOMG
[0:23:08] <%GabeSweetMan> Truth
[0:23:09] <%Agami23> im still sad that blitz baller isnt a class in ff14
[0:23:10] <%MoonObscure> she hot
[0:23:11] <%ElkRiverDog> Listen, 10 was the first one I played and thus it has a special place in my heart, but it is NOT the best FF game
[0:23:15] <%RealThiele> the stoic sacrificial lamb
[0:23:17] <Madinki> BIG KIMARI PUSH AND THAT'S IT
[0:23:19] <blue8moon> hey, I made him a second black mage when I played, he was very useful then
[0:23:25] <$AzureGale> Kimari's overdrive sux big time
[0:23:26] <anfiilookinsgood> how good was Plagues ff10 review
[0:23:31] <AthenaAegis> Lulu's dress is made of Nomura Kappa

[0:23:45] <%LordSDB> @anfiilookinsgood It was great and very funny
[0:23:54] <Madinki> The Yamoto- something
[0:23:59] <%Grimlockfly> Tidus is a little bit TOO much of a goober, and the design is too much
[0:24:00] <Madinki> I forgot what it was
[0:24:05] <SpaceManHotepIV> nadeshiko?
[0:24:08] <deltamissfits> just today?

[0:24:22] <Madinki> @SpaceManHotepIV That's it!
[0:24:22] <@SoFarFetched> that one priestess character trait? geefThink
[0:24:27] <+realm_forge> She’s got an ass that won’t quit got it
[0:24:29] <sakuraasouls> I adore your vtube model omg its adorable potato276PotatoLegionLove
[0:24:34] <TheAntiNihilist> I think Paige should replay FFX. I think she forgets the vibe of the game

[0:24:36] <+I4gotmyname89> Yamato Nadeshiko
[0:24:37] <+FxyDEV> Auron

[0:24:54] <+DakotaMacDoodle> I really liked 12 as well even tho the story is a star wars basically. the art style and battle system is fun
[0:24:57] <%freelancebabymaker> my power went out ten minutes ago whatd i miss
[0:25:05] <Madinki> Yamato Nadeshiko: The IDEAL JAPANISE WOMAN
[0:25:07] <%Ell1ot> remember when Waka compared the destruction of Riku's home to fireworks?
[0:25:14] <%LordSDB> Is it Damsel in distress? Just trying to guess the trope
[0:25:17] <%Lion_kun> I thought the stream won't be for another hour :(

[0:25:47] <%LordSDB> Also for me its goes FF 12, then FF9 then between FF6/10 for me
[0:25:52] <%GabeSweetMan> Paige is the character archetype you're thinking the Yamato Nadeshiko? "flower of Nipponese womanhood"
[0:25:54] <+realm_forge> Shrine maiden?
[0:25:54] <anfiilookinsgood> remember when Yuna embraced THE GUN?
[0:25:55] <%Reaped_Psyche> Until she gets kidnapped by Seymore.

[0:26:02] <blue8moon> Yuna is as much the protagonist as Tidus, in concept
[0:26:02] <%JoshManVGH> One of TV Tropes tropes for her is "Cronic Hero Syndrome"
[0:26:13] <islandsunn> I love seeing the model gulp like a fish as you chow down
[0:26:15] <%freelancebabymaker> well at least we know youve eaten
[0:26:15] <bob900000> balthier is great

[0:26:31] <%saadi90> I love 12!
[0:26:31] <@SoFarFetched> ffxII is just Star wars Kappa
[0:26:33] <$AzureGale> Paige is good people
[0:26:35] <blue8moon> 12 has an issue where the plot drops out for like 6 solid hours in the middle of the game LUL
[0:26:35] <%BettyMwwaahh> didnt 12 make the bunny girls? hard to forget it for that reason
[0:26:42] <+DakotaMacDoodle> that's totally fair

[0:27:44] <%freelancebabymaker> something about those netflix transformers shows rubs me the wrong way
[0:27:50] <%Monkeyweed21> @GalacticaPhanto Yamato Nadeshiko is an ironic stage name for wrestling
[0:27:51] <%Jack_of_No_Trades> If Eli told you not to jump off a bridge, would you do it?
[0:27:53] <M0untain_wolf> Saw it last night and i was entertained
[0:27:57] <%zeroarturia> The greatest tragedy is beast wars Megatron

[0:44:41] <%LeiaSkynoober> Father and Sister
[0:44:41] <Aydarkzero> reeeeeeeeee
[0:44:42] <%That1blindkid> its a church thing
[0:44:43] <%freelancebabymaker> shes like his carer or something
[0:44:47] <%JoshManVGH> So who's the dude with the bowl?
[0:44:47] <Coystick> They're Lady and bird
[0:44:48] <%Monkeyweed21> its a church
[0:44:50] <BigFingerRo> get hit with a BOWL}
[0:44:52] <+MooseIsGoose> I think adopted
[0:44:59] <%g0atmeal> i've never been to church, is it like this?
[0:45:00] <anfiilookinsgood> Soups up !
[0:45:01] <%nip_nips> bowl vs hammer, which would win?
[0:45:09] <bowiedayko> Soup time
[0:45:11] <BigFingerRo> YOU GOT A BOWL YOU'RE READY TO FUCKIN ROCK
[0:45:11] <Broand> did you vanquish the doggy
[0:45:12] <+MooseIsGoose> smash his bowl
[0:45:13] <%freelancebabymaker> @JoshManVGH hes the guy who made the painting were in right now
[0:45:16] <TurtlesAndTentacles> more like father and captor
[0:45:16] <+lordericter> oh shit Paige already made it this far in the boss
[0:45:17] <%JoshManVGH> Oh so like Father Priest and Sister Nun?
[0:45:18] <cidmaik> From what I gathered they are family... not father - daughter though
[0:45:20] <%EdHeng> my church is on fire most of the time D:
[0:45:20] <%SMuffinMan> @broand She did
[0:45:20] <$AzureGale> Take me to church etc.
[0:45:23] <bowiedayko> Soup beats bowl and hammer
[0:45:23] <%JobbedBone> woolie describes it like this LUL
[0:45:24] <islandsunn> It's getting frosty
[0:45:24] <+Ne1son> This is what happens when you are high in church
[0:45:25] <%nip_nips> @Broand pup was snuffed
[0:45:26] <%ComfortableStranger> why  the fire tho?
[0:45:26] <%AncelDeLambert> everything burning down, blood, screaming. Yeah, church
[0:45:27] <%Sotetsu> She's guarding him as part of the plot to keep the first flame from being linked.
[0:45:28] <%Ziegsy> once a year anyway, the priest slaps your head with a holy bowl
[0:45:30] <%AncelDeLambert> @PeachSaliva he is big
[0:45:31] <cidmaik> or part of the same tribe or something like that
[0:45:32] <%freelancebabymaker> thats fair
[0:45:34] <%samTUMZfestival> This is what Woolie sees
[0:45:37] <+dalmek> more like the STRONGegration
[0:45:38] <+ThomasOfTroy> Because it's cool
[0:45:40] <Zudrag> it was spicy soup
[0:45:40] <bowiedayko> Soup so good it raises the dead
[0:45:41] <%JoshManVGH> He is very huge
[0:45:43] <+Romuken> you gotta hit him, or his bowl?
[0:45:43] <%Ziegsy> homemade chilli
[0:45:43] <PMda2nd> chili
[0:45:44] <%athuramn> what a cool boss
[0:45:44] <%Sotetsu> That's the Lord Vessel
[0:45:45] <Coystick> Treat him as a stage hazard and home in on the woman
[0:45:45] <+tempestzephyr> he's got chilli
[0:45:45] <@MistyMntns> Its the Holy Fire
[0:45:47] <blue8moon> yeah, the father and sister are as in priest and nun, not necessarily relatives
[0:45:48] <CrimsonFox777> Metal bowl sparked against the stone, maybe?
[0:45:49] <bowiedayko> Soup is spicy
[0:45:50] <%AncelDeLambert> and by big, I mean the perspective is screwing you over
[0:45:50] <%Monkeyweed21> Spicy soup bowl
[0:45:50] <$AzureGale> The fire within still burns bright
[0:45:53] <%freelancebabymaker> because when as are two a flame alighteth
[0:45:58] <cidmaik> Good luck... I had to get help to beat this one
[0:45:59] <Djinnazz> XD
[0:45:59] <peachy996> Fair strat, She staggers from your hits and you'll be spending the whole boss fight on her anyway
[0:45:59] <%Agami23> because he is slamming a lord vessel around
[0:46:00] <islandsunn> oof
[0:46:00] <%freelancebabymaker> damn
[0:46:02] <Aydarkzero> greed
[0:46:02] <+FiresideInternetCafe> GOD DAMN
[0:46:03] <BigFingerRo> THAT'S TWO
[0:46:03] <PMda2nd> gg
[0:46:03] <+SmartLX> His shins are the most exposed part.
[0:46:03] <@PatStaresAt> u can do it beb
[0:46:04] <%samTUMZfestival> WAAAAAAH
[0:46:04] <@Jekado> look at this song of fire and ice... psaWink
[0:46:04] <$AzureGale> DED
[0:46:05] <%cade_calrayn> Especially if you’re gay, this is what gay church looks like. We like it hot and spicy
[0:46:12] <%nip_nips> still practice runs
[0:46:12] <%ComfortableStranger> was that BOWLing?
[0:46:14] <$TheNewZealandStory> i do not think this boss is well designed
[0:46:21] <%JoshManVGH> The holy fire, filled with ire. The blessed ice is filled with... lice....?
[0:46:21] <TheEmeraldPanic> RIP
[0:46:21] <%That1blindkid> Does she know about Gael?
[0:46:23] <+realm_forge> He’s got big cloak and hair so he looks bulkier than he is
[0:46:23] <anfiilookinsgood> bowling for soup?
[0:46:24] <%IamGrapes> @PeachSaliva dont want to invite Gale to the party?
[0:46:29] <%AncelDeLambert> @PeachSaliva it's two things. The perspective makes it hard for you to judge the distance, since he's so big. And he doesn't react to you hitting him, so you don't get confirmation
[0:46:32] <%BettyMwwaahh> its jut too long
[0:46:33] <peachy996> I think 3 was too much
[0:46:34] <Gelphaze> if you ember you could summon Gale!
[0:46:40] <cidmaik> hot and spicy... but... its icy and dry in that church
[0:46:40] <peachy996> overkill
[0:46:41] <%nip_nips> gael has story purpose
[0:46:43] <%probably_facetious> Oh hey, this fight is in Code Vein.
[0:46:45] <BigFingerRo> Do 10 attempts and then summon
[0:46:47] <+ThomasOfTroy> This is straight up one of the best bosses in Dark Souls
[0:46:50] <%Lion_kun> I think the boss fulfills its design of being super hard.
[0:46:52] <+Valdus_Storm19> Bonjour everyone
[0:46:59] <%IamGrapes> @PeachSaliva we wont think less of you if you invite Gale
[0:47:01] <%g0atmeal> @Gelphaze you can summon him regardless i think. devs knew this one is tough
[0:47:01] <%Ziegsy> shes got to proove she can do it solo! she doesnt need gale
[0:47:05] <%samTUMZfestival> Comment ca va?
[0:47:06] <HawkHollywood> he actually joins the fight in the 2nd phase so you can still crush 1st solo
[0:47:07] <%GalacticaPhanto> Having help does make the boss easier to fight
[0:47:10] <%cache_22> Friede staggers so it's easy to confirm hits.
[0:47:30] <$cgreene64> I do really enjoy that the arena gets bigger in the 2nd phase
[0:47:32] <hjhelio> @hjhelio is new here. Say hello! SeemsGood
[0:47:34] <%g0atmeal> that combo is so satisfying
[0:47:36] <%ComfortableStranger> stunlock pro
[0:47:37] <cidmaik> Anything is easy if everyone gets the aggro off of each other
[0:47:52] <@SoFarFetched> look paige needs that dig bick energy to go "NO HELP FROM FRIEND geefNo "
[0:47:53] <%Ziegsy> hello!
[0:48:04] <%RedPanda25> You can do it peach!
[0:48:04] <daisymaisy02> that teleport shit is nasty
[0:48:13] <%samTUMZfestival> You got em
[0:48:14] <%femto216> My Smart TV is super delayed compared to my Phone lol
[0:48:17] <cidmaik> whats nasty is her horrid reach
[0:48:18] <%freelancebabymaker> @peachsaliva summoning gael kinda has a bit of story significance so dont feel  bad if you summon him
[0:48:20] <%Monkeyweed21> nice
[0:48:22] <anfiilookinsgood> T pose!
[0:48:22] <californaya> YEAH
[0:48:23] <silverpoyozo> ez
[0:48:23] <%Ziegsy> @SoFarFetched what about assistance from an enemy?
[0:48:23] <%RedPanda25> Siiiiiick
[0:48:26] <%JoshManVGH> When in doubt, hug it out!
[0:48:29] <+thedarknightprinny> I really love this fight so satisfying when you win. like lady Maria in blood borne
[0:48:31] <%SMuffinMan> @daisymaisy02 It's not that nasty just turn around and bop her lol
[0:48:31] <islandsunn> has Paige gotten to phase 3 yet
[0:48:31] <cidmaik> You can be 2 miles away and she still hits you
[0:48:32] <+MooseIsGoose> health
[0:48:33] <%Sotetsu> I'm out of hot cocoa :(
[0:48:35] <+So_I_Started_Blasting> getting that first phase down
[0:48:42] <%nip_nips> @islandsunn on her first attempt last night
[0:48:51] <%EdHeng> his ass is so fat it's stuck in the chair
[0:48:54] <@Jekado> God i drink soup like that...
[0:48:56] <%AncelDeLambert> trolololololol
[0:48:57] <SiriusLeeLost> When she vanishes, just stand still. When you hear that whispering noise, start dodging.  Otherwise you're wasting a lot of stamina between hits
[0:48:57] <%samTUMZfestival> Big ass can't get out the chair
[0:49:00] <Parapattern> Butt Stuck
[0:49:01] <BigFingerRo> THAT'S 3
[0:49:01] <+MooseIsGoose> got them to half health
[0:49:01] <hjhelio> F
[0:49:03] <%Ziegsy> BOWL'D
[0:49:03] <cidmaik> Jesus one shot
[0:49:05] <BigFingerRo> HAT TRICK
[0:49:05] <%femto216> Hit his ass chair
[0:49:07] <%ComfortableStranger> does frostbite only slow?
[0:49:13] <anfiilookinsgood> there is alot of noise
[0:49:16] <%g0atmeal> this is like the O&S of ds3
[0:49:17] <%AncelDeLambert> you do you
[0:49:20] <+wizard_of_diamonds> Sensory overload, I get it
[0:49:21] <+MooseIsGoose> @ComfortableStranger It slows stamina regen
[0:49:23] <$cgreene64> @ComfortableStranger fostbite damages and slows stamina regen
[0:49:25] <cidmaik> Frostbite slows you and slows your stsmina recovery
[0:49:27] <%Monkeyweed21> @ComfortableStranger damage and stamina penalties
[0:49:29] <BigFingerRo> I'm telling you, it's gonna be 10
[0:49:34] <%nip_nips> slowed stamina regen is bad for unga bunga
[0:49:35] <$Sphincter_Spelunker> what up gamers. how long ago did gameplay start?
[0:49:36] <%JoshManVGH> How does one become frostbitten while surrounded by fire and molten juice?
[0:49:36] <%ComfortableStranger> gotcha thanks
[0:49:37] <%AncelDeLambert> that said, again, this is the HARDEST fight in all of Dark Souls, we're cool with you summoning
[0:49:39] <@MelBrooksKA> Lady murder comes naturally to Paige
[0:49:40] <%JobbedBone> were they trying to force him into a throne like the other lordsS?
[0:49:54] <%nip_nips> not as hard as pinwheel
[0:49:55] <$cgreene64> cool animation tho
[0:49:55] <Eightesu> can you back stab her
[0:49:59] <+ThomasOfTroy> Yes
[0:50:01] <+Romuken> Wait, Vordt's hammer does ice dmg, right?
[0:50:09] <cidmaik> this boss is pain... if you decide to go full Ice res second phase crushes you with fire
[0:50:11] <Dunmarkh> @Romuken yee
[0:50:12] <benjiFG> where'd she go
[0:50:12] <%AncelDeLambert> @JobbedBone Friede is preventing him from finding his flail and whipping himself
[0:50:13] <%SMuffinMan> ...
[0:50:14] <%freelancebabymaker> NICE
[0:50:15] <bowiedayko> I never liked the really hairy bosses like this as my brain can't handle all the moving stuff on screen.
[0:50:20] <%g0atmeal> she's immune to frost but weak to strike so it's still good for this boss
[0:50:28] <%samTUMZfestival> Paige not stopping until all other ladies are dead.
[0:50:28] <%ahomeschooldropout> Paige's archnemesis is another woman trying to murder her
[0:50:29] <%JobbedBone> ice is an aux effect not a damage type but ye
[0:50:33] <+Romuken> Ah ok, was wondering about that.  Thank you @g0atmeal
[0:50:34] <%AncelDeLambert> @cidmaik then third does Dark
[0:50:37] <+RayDaug> Object permanence is for cowards
[0:50:43] <%nip_nips> kick the woman for extra disrespect
[0:50:44] <Coystick> KICKED
[0:50:46] <islandsunn> that kick!
[0:50:46] <AthenaAegis> Oof, I heard and felt that blow connect on Friede
[0:50:50] <%Ziegsy> @bowiedayko Its a cloak but i get chu
[0:50:53] <$Sphincter_Spelunker> kick the baby
[0:50:54] <%AncelDeLambert> @JobbedBone 3% total health on proc
[0:50:59] <benjiFG> i wonder if you can use the kick to reset her into not jumping backwards
[0:51:03] <cidmaik> I go Dark on this game
[0:51:13] <%femto216> She teleports right behind you everytime
[0:51:27] <DapperCadavr> nothing personel kid
[0:51:30] <BigFingerRo> a friend of mine did this fight with 99 STR and the demon axe and STILL had to try a couple times
[0:51:31] <cidmaik> that magic that turns your weapon embed in dark is strong xD
[0:51:38] <%AncelDeLambert> oh, excuse me, ELEVEN percent total on proc, 3% is Cinders
[0:51:39] <%JobbedBone> @AncelDeLambert and?
[0:51:41] <TheCheeseWilly> I missed a few filler episodes why are you a Vtuber now?
[0:51:43] <%freelancebabymaker> wow nice
[0:51:48] <Dunmarkh> @femto216 180 is a lot of degrees dude
[0:51:49] <%AncelDeLambert> so Frostbite is even stronger in vanilla
[0:51:52] <$cgreene64> @TheCheeseWilly it's fun and easy!
[0:51:55] <%samTUMZfestival> @TheCheeseWilly Why not?
[0:51:57] <Coystick> Keep space between you and bird daddy
[0:52:01] <%freelancebabymaker> @TheCheeseWilly cuz why not
[0:52:02] <Eightesu> couldn't you hypothetically hit both Friede and Ariendel to get like double the damage?
[0:52:02] <+ThomasOfTroy> @TheCheeseWilly She's finally embraced her fursona
[0:52:04] <%Ziegsy> @TheCheeseWilly a witch got her and locked her in a library
[0:52:06] <cidmaik> She can heal right?
[0:52:12] <+MooseIsGoose> I found it easier to unlock and fight them since they are so all over the place
[0:52:14] <sirrice77> @TheCheeseWilly because that is the inevitable fate of everyone, to become vtuber
[0:52:18] <%freelancebabymaker> @TheCheeseWilly it also lets her start streams quicker
[0:52:23] <%AncelDeLambert> LUL she just rolled into him
[0:52:23] <%g0atmeal> frost has a cooldown tho, i think bleed can be proc'd over and over
[0:52:24] <%RealThiele> the heal she does is like 2 hits of unga
[0:52:31] <%JoshManVGH> ALMS! ALMS FOR THE POOR!
[0:52:37] <$Sphincter_Spelunker> @TheCheeseWilly lupus flare ups kept her off camera, vtuber shows her reactions while she's still off cam
[0:52:45] <cidmaik> thats two extra hits that didnt exist before
[0:52:50] <%JoshManVGH> Nice recovery!
[0:52:57] <Coystick> SHE DRINK
[0:52:58] <%JoshManVGH> Yeyeye!
[0:52:58] <%ComfortableStranger> the FOV is doing no favors in this fight
[0:52:59] <BigYanno> Since your swings take so much stamina frostbite is basically your kryptonite as it slows stamina regen
[0:53:00] <cipher758> lol
[0:53:05] <%RedPanda25> You can do it peach!!!!!!
[0:53:05] <%AncelDeLambert> YEEEEEAAAAAH!
[0:53:06] <%g0atmeal> NICE
[0:53:06] <+MooseIsGoose> Boom
[0:53:07] <%BoxNavy> B)
[0:53:07] <+MooseIsGoose> Heal
[0:53:08] <%AncelDeLambert> phase 3
[0:53:08] <Coystick> Yeyeyeye
[0:53:08] <%freelancebabymaker> nice nice nice
[0:53:08] <kenny_biff> !!!!!
[0:53:09] <Eightesu> Round 3 baby

[0:54:48] <Coystick> Good warmup tho
[0:54:49] <%Agami23> at some point you onehanded your weapon, and suddenly hit her like 5 times which was rad af
[0:54:49] <+MooseIsGoose> You were doing good
[0:54:50] <%cache_22> You did switch to onehanding in that last bit of the third phase.

[0:55:54] <yuggie_the_shark> did she beat the game and not learn stamina management?
[0:55:55] <%Monkeyweed21> Are you enjoying Ornstein and Smough of the Astral Clocktower?
[0:55:59] <%JoshManVGH> The battle of which woman has the coldest weapon
[0:56:00] <%KeiganOfAstora> Is it okay to tell her to use embers?
[0:56:01] <cidmaik> Now I know... the bigger the weapon the better... that or a katana
[0:56:06] <@SoFarFetched> @yuggie_the_shark look sometimes you gotta unga bunga geefTux

[0:56:22] <+Ne1son> Holy poise
[0:56:22] <TurtlesAndTentacles> @sofarfetched people still being dumb?
[0:56:34] <@SoFarFetched> @KeiganOfAstora I mean thats entirely up to her
[0:56:35] <sirrice77> @freelancebabymaker yes but if you're embered already you can't use one
[0:56:37] <+MooseIsGoose> boom
[0:56:43] <+charlie2089> Is the screen randomly zooming in and out for anyone else?
[0:56:46] <TurtlesAndTentacles> Easy Peezy
[0:56:46] <%g0atmeal> i'd consider saving embers for the later bosses, she's nearly got this
[0:56:48] <%Agami23> i cant tell if i find friede hot or if i find her scythe hot
[0:56:54] <+kungfauxboi> you can skip
[0:56:56] <%freelancebabymaker> @sirrice77 shit i didnt know that
[0:56:56] <+ThomasOfTroy> It's not
[0:56:56] <@SoFarFetched> Its why she had to put "First Playthrough" because people kept telling her what to do and how to play
[0:56:57] <TheCheeseWilly> Spanked
[0:56:57] <cidmaik> it zooms out for second phase
[0:56:57] <%Lion_kun> Nah
[0:56:58] <Fennrir28> Good luck
[0:56:58] <Djinnazz> no?
[0:56:59] <benjiFG> no

[0:57:01] <+ThomasOfTroy> It's fine
[0:57:01] <+MooseIsGoose> no
[0:57:02] <+thelonechris> No...?
[0:57:02] <peachy996> I havent noticed anything
[0:57:03] <%SMuffinMan> Looks fine to me
[0:57:05] <+lucaflowe> Is this really a three phase fight?
[0:57:11] <cidmaik> it really is
[0:57:11] <AthenaAegis> Calling it now, Paige is gonna STOMP this fucker before the night is over
[0:57:11] <%SMuffinMan> @lucaflowe yup
[0:57:13] <%ahomeschooldropout> Paige's natural archnemesis would be, of course, another woman trying to kill her
[0:57:13] <+ThomasOfTroy> @lucaflowe Hell yea it is
[0:57:14] <TheCheeseWilly> Screens fine for me
[0:57:14] <%Lion_kun> She got Friede to 50% in the third phase, that's pretty good.
[0:57:15] <+lucaflowe> Disgusting
[0:57:16] <+kungfauxboi> gotcha
[0:57:21] <fruit_pie_the_magician> Screen zooms in when the camera is next to a wall
[0:57:24] <%freelancebabymaker> @lucaflowe lol yeah
[0:57:25] <sirrice77> @freelancebabymaker yeah it's to prevent DS1 humanity abuse from happening again i think
[0:57:25] <@SoFarFetched> and its literally "calm down its her  first playthrough just relax"
[0:57:26] <%SMuffinMan> @lucaflowe You mean awesome
[0:57:35] <@Jekado> Breathe and take a break if you have to paige you're doing super good.
[0:57:40] <%femto216> BegWan
[0:57:40] <$Sphincter_Spelunker> it's about to get rocky
[0:57:43] <+lucaflowe> Things can be awesome and disgusting at the same time lmao
[0:57:46] <%Ziegsy> backseaters will be thrown from the bus
[0:57:48] <%freelancebabymaker> this fight is so long they give you one of the rewards 2/3 of the way through it
[0:57:52] <TheCheeseWilly> That was almost fucking rad
[0:57:59] <%Monkeyweed21> Paige has a 50% damage increase vs Women
[0:58:04] <%freelancebabymaker> @sirrice77 damn okay
[0:58:04] <cidmaik> This phase is annoying... gotta go super slow... land 1 or 2 hits... check for steam soup guy position
[0:58:12] <%g0atmeal> @Monkeyweed21 Womanslayer Greathammer
[0:58:18] <@MistyMntns> He just wants His Soup

[0:59:03] <cidmaik> Third phase... there is no strategy... beg you land your swings and she misses hers
[0:59:04] <%Ziegsy> is this revenge for paige drinking all the soup throughout the game?

[1:02:37] <%JobbedBone> Impractical weapons are more impressive. Thats the whole point
[1:02:49] <yuggie_the_shark> aaaaaah! says soup dad
[1:02:56] <blue8moon> I mean, the scythe is at least good at grabbing people LUL
[1:02:57] <$Sphincter_Spelunker> @BigFingerRo her witch's curse
[1:03:07] <plzza_kun> ! COLD NIPS!
[1:03:17] <%femto216> He is like a truck lol
[1:03:23] <@Jekado> Plague talking about Scythes reminds me of him talking about how bad bat'leths are from star trek
[1:03:23] <%JobbedBone> anyone can kill with GUN
[1:03:23] <%g0atmeal> would've been cool if they talked during the fight like in sekiro
[1:03:25] <cidmaik> just noticed soup dad hips are so big the chair is stuck on him huh
[1:03:25] <yuggie_the_shark> bowled over
[1:03:28] <islandsunn> he bulldozed u lol
[1:03:32] <Coystick> She has like a sniper and shotgun version of the frost attack it's so cool.
[1:03:35] <AthenaAegis> Soup Guy is Pat with the chair stuck to his ass Kappa
[1:03:42] <TheCheeseWilly> TAKE HIS MUSTARD
[1:03:50] <+MisterAvry> nice you interrupted the heal
[1:03:54] <%JobbedBone> watching plague play baba was something else LUL
[1:04:06] <@Jekado> I'm just thinking of the weird combo of ice cream and soup now.
[1:04:06] <cidmaik> You literslly cannot move him away from his chair
[1:04:07] <@SoFarFetched> plague playing baba I felt his brain fry more than paige's
[1:04:07] <Eightesu> this is the famous estus soup
[1:04:11] <%AncelDeLambert> scythes are a stupid weapon, but they're cool, so who cares
[1:04:11] <+charlie2089> A hammer twice as big as you is exactly practicle either
[1:04:17] <TheCheeseWilly> Omg his fat juicy dumper is stuck in the chair
[1:04:21] <@SoFarFetched> paige is a short fry,plague is the LONG fry Kappa
[1:04:31] <+MooseIsGoose> nice roll
[1:04:32] <%g0atmeal> that was close
[1:04:33] <%Lion_kun> that was close
[1:04:37] <T_Sasquatch> UNGA BUNGA
[1:04:37] <%Monkeyweed21> lol they never fixed the floating candles
[1:04:38] <%JobbedBone> and the difference was that plague got ANGRY
[1:04:42] <peachy996> you're getting the hang of phase 2 better
[1:04:43] <%CptCreampuff16> When she does the invis jump, wait till she lands turn around and swing youll interrupt her charge
[1:04:45] <+MisterAvry> that got chaotic
[1:04:47] <%samTUMZfestival> Aww no
[1:04:47] <BigFingerRo> THAT'S SEVUNNNNNN
[1:04:47] <@MistyMntns> You Got Soup'ed
[1:04:48] <Coystick> Got CAMERA'D
[1:04:49] <+MooseIsGoose> Dang he just kinda stood there

[1:04:55] <@PatStaresAt> wh balls ass
[1:04:59] <@PatStaresAt> why
[1:04:59] <cidmaik> lol
[1:05:00] <%Agami23> i hate how ariandel kinda just envelopes you so you cant see shit
[1:05:02] <%Monkeyweed21> ITS JUST MORE SOUP
[1:05:02] <%nip_nips> why not
[1:05:03] <BigFingerRo> Succcc every nut that I haaaave
[1:05:05] <yuggie_the_shark> balls insde of your ass?
[1:05:05] <+Romuken> would her invisi-jump be a good time for Paige to use that ridiculously long wind-up swing?
[1:05:05] <$Sphincter_Spelunker> wh pat
[1:05:05] <%ComfortableStranger> next try WILL succeed
[1:05:07] <jacobgarmon> Hi
[1:05:08] <%cache_22> Don't worry sadghetti is here to help.
[1:05:09] <T_Sasquatch> Thals Balls
[1:05:10] <Eightesu> more like soup up the butt
[1:05:12] <PMda2nd> 🫕
[1:05:16] <+MooseIsGoose> He put his ass in your camera
[1:05:17] <%Puhff> NOM
[1:05:19] <+MisterAvry> @Romuken It would
[1:05:28] <+Romuken> noic
[1:05:29] <@SoFarFetched> @CptCreampuff16 she's been told that advice many times yesterday,we're trying not to backseat hard today.
[1:05:32] <%samTUMZfestival> Can they mocap jiggling ass?
[1:05:34] <Coystick> Just let the bird man butt chug his spicy soup gawd
[1:05:44] <blue8moon> just take the creepy old man's soup gift, that's all he wants
[1:05:54] <%freelancebabymaker> NICE
[1:05:57] <$Sphincter_Spelunker> @samTUMZfestival dude LUL
[1:05:58] <yuggie_the_shark> I want sister friede and lady maria to make out
[1:06:05] <DrkJP520> Just kill him now. He'll never see it coming
[1:06:11] <%samTUMZfestival> @Sphincter_Spelunker I'm sure Peter Jackson could.
[1:06:15] <cidmaik> I like how this fight is kinda anime like... he doesn't even bother to move to help her unless you crush her skull
[1:06:17] <Ravioli_Ronin> WOW that’s a big damage
[1:06:18] <yuggie_the_shark> nice
[1:06:21] <%samTUMZfestival> Andy Serkis THICC
[1:06:45] <@MistyMntns> Only Big Numbers today
[1:06:47] <+MisterAvry> when I fight her I keep landing backstabs that she dashes out of and I'm stuck in the animation
[1:06:49] <cidmaik> Oh right... he's a vampire... needs blood first to get warm to move
[1:06:51] <benjiFG> nice
[1:06:53] <TheCheeseWilly> Now dats a lota damaj
[1:06:54] <@PatStaresAt> noice
[1:06:57] <yuggie_the_shark> muh fleyal
[1:06:59] <blue8moon> friede too cool for school
[1:07:04] <%g0atmeal> @MisterAvry backstabbing the air looks really silly
[1:07:04] <T_Sasquatch> UNGA BUNGA
[1:07:06] <+Romuken> @PeachSaliva maybe mega-swing when she hops behind you to counter?  I don't play the game but I remember you showing off that move and how slow it was.
[1:07:10] <Ravioli_Ronin> KEEILL
[1:07:16] <$Sphincter_Spelunker> only 3 heals used for phase 1 again, good pace
[1:07:18] <BigFingerRo> yes, stay in the corner it is safe there
[1:07:22] <+Romuken> ball shit oh no
[1:07:27] <$Sphincter_Spelunker> welp
[1:07:27] <%freelancebabymaker> damn
[1:07:28] <BigFingerRo> THAT'S 8
[1:07:36] <BigFingerRo> Cmoooon 2 more!
[1:07:40] <%Tenchi_G> Ive seen someone take a month to do this
[1:07:40] <DrkJP520> I wonder what a scythe vs scythe fight would look like IRL. Probably really goofy.
[1:07:46] <+MisterAvry> @g0atmeal especially with a giant flaming club like I use
[1:07:46] <@SoFarFetched> GIVE ME THAT FORBIDDEN LAVA SOUP geefJuice geefJuice geefJuice geefJuice
[1:07:53] <%ComfortableStranger> Paige you got this, you know what to do
[1:07:53] <+SmartLX> How much help are we allowed to give?
[1:07:54] <%Monkeyweed21> THE WHOLE AISLE IS JUST SOUP
[1:08:06] <%nip_nips> WHY ARE YOU AT SOUP?
[1:08:09] <bowiedayko> You can do it anime lady
[1:08:15] <@SoFarFetched> @SmartLX this is all her today, Chat fucked up yesterday with it being 90% backseating.
[1:08:16] <%nip_nips> uh oh
[1:08:17] <cidmaik> 9
[1:08:18] <TheCheeseWilly> Maybe if you ping pong and try to keep them on opposite ends
[1:08:20] <Djinnazz> WREKCT
[1:08:20] <Coystick> Do not stray from the holy path of R1
[1:08:24] <+SmartLX> Got it.
[1:08:25] <BigFingerRo> THAT'S 9
[1:08:25] <bowiedayko> I'm at the soup store
[1:08:26] <+MooseIsGoose> That was just a reset
[1:08:27] <Eightesu> some runs be like that
[1:08:35] <@SoFarFetched> THE HOLY R1
[1:08:36] <@SoFarFetched> PRAY IT
[1:08:37] <PMda2nd> perfect
[1:08:38] <%ComfortableStranger> maybe finish the sadsghetti first?
[1:08:39] <heartlesshealer> You can do it Paige. You are the Big and Strong, and the pets love you
[1:08:39] <+MisterAvry> I've only gotten an R2 on her by finding her invisible
[1:08:41] <zzNamttamzz> Big and Strong
[1:08:43] <sakuraasouls> now shes just trying to protecc the flamin cheeto soup
[1:08:45] <%freelancebabymaker> you got this unga bunga
[1:08:46] <$AzureGale> FLAWLESS VICTPRY
[1:08:52] <%Ziegsy> axialTalon axialTalon axialTalon axialTalon
[1:08:52] <Blak3_Nikos> Ur still there?!
[1:08:55] <+ThomasOfTroy> Not helpful really
[1:08:55] <%g0atmeal> she damages through shields
[1:08:55] <%FacetiousAF> mmmm keep at it
[1:08:55] <BigFingerRo> @cidmaik How many do you think it'll take? 10's almost certain
[1:08:55] <%ComfortableStranger> food distracting Paige
[1:08:57] <Eightesu> dodging is better
[1:08:58] <+MisterAvry> nah stay bunga
[1:08:58] <cidmaik> Yeah R1 is your friend... L2 and R2 are ill advisors
[1:09:00] <PMda2nd> nah, your doing fine
[1:09:02] <Djinnazz> it's a grab.
[1:09:02] <bowiedayko> Do what you';re doing
[1:09:03] <afronooch> l=lewd
[1:09:03] <@PatStaresAt> @PeachSaliva Shield can be helpful but she eats through it with the magic damage and frost
[1:09:05] <blue8moon> your shield won't be helpful really
[1:09:06] <heartlesshealer> uhhh, it depends. Your setup is fine
[1:09:06] <PMda2nd> you're*
[1:09:06] <%Lion_kun> she will break your guard
[1:09:06] <%SMuffinMan> sipsipHellmo sipsipHellmo sipsipHellmo
[1:09:07] <islandsunn> this is fine
[1:09:07] <%freelancebabymaker> i dont think itll make a difference here
[1:09:08] <ColdxCrush> Oh man this was my hardest DS3 boss out of all of them
[1:09:08] <%nip_nips> UNGA BUNGA IS THE WAY
[1:09:09] <+SmartLX> Phase 3 is a lot of elemental damage on the scythe.
[1:09:10] <%TheWinged7> such a slob paige
[1:09:11] <Djinnazz> LOL, no....
[1:09:11] <sirrice77> she combos too much for a shield
[1:09:13] <+MisterAvry> yeah this is hard as BALLS
[1:09:13] <peachy996> of this dlc yeah
[1:09:14] <%peyodogo> you're doing fine
[1:09:14] <TheEndlessRiver1> eh i wouldnt say harest
[1:09:14] <%cache_22> I think your current strategy is doing well for the most part.
[1:09:15] <%TheWinged7> the sauce eerywhere
[1:09:16] <luftraumm1> I'd say at this point you're not gonna get used to shielding
[1:09:16] <bowiedayko> She has magic damage. Just DOGDE
[1:09:16] <%AncelDeLambert> possibly the hardest Bloodborne boss, too
[1:09:16] <BigYanno> ehhhhhhhhhhhh second hardest
[1:09:17] <%samTUMZfestival> Another benefit of VTuber, she's covered in condiments.
[1:09:18] <Blak3_Nikos> Dang
[1:09:18] <cidmaik> poke her... 2 hits
[1:09:19] <@Jekado> i feel like you'd loose too much damage doing shield
[1:09:19] <%superc37> no she aint
[1:09:19] <@commanderclaw> IMO it's only the *second* hardest boss
[1:09:21] <TheEndlessRiver1> second hardest at most
[1:09:22] <Frade> Paige plz, you had beaten bloodborne, this is cake
[1:09:22] <islandsunn> bosses like this will blow through most shields
[1:09:23] <%freelancebabymaker> look ma no hands
[1:09:23] <%Monkeyweed21> The hardest boss so far
[1:09:23] <+JusTTheGuyYouNeed> fourth hardest but
[1:09:23] <cidmaik> wait her out
[1:09:24] <BigYanno> MAYBE third hardest
[1:09:25] <@Jekado> and your play style doesn't use shield
[1:09:25] <fruit_pie_the_magician> Your shield sucks to guard with, and dark fucks up the best shields
[1:09:27] <%bluetocho13> who told you this was the hardest
[1:09:29] <cidmaik> poke her more
[1:09:29] <%probably_facetious> She sipp
[1:09:30] <jetpack_rorschasch> Guys, be nice to Piage. We talked about this.
[1:09:31] <TurtlesAndTentacles> you got to the 3rd phase in one fucking try. trust me you're strong as hell.
[1:09:31] <EuropanLamprey> One of the top three, you got another one on this level in the next DLC
[1:09:31] <$Sphincter_Spelunker> I was mid-type about to ask how much spaghetti sauce is on that desk lol
[1:09:31] <%femto216> Midir would like to chat with you
[1:09:32] <cidmaik> wait a bit more
[1:09:33] <krabthecrab> It's not as hard as Pinwheel, but still pretty tough
[1:09:33] <%peyodogo> what could help - so you can practice the later mechanics more - is summoning gaeñ
[1:09:35] <metalsiren31> You have a really good weapon for her, she's just really hard and you have to learn the timing
[1:09:37] <%ComfortableStranger> you got to phase 3, you don't need to change strat, just gain foucus
[1:09:39] <Coystick> Top 2
[1:09:41] <@PatStaresAt> @PeachSaliva Main thing is when she go invisible if you just guess a direction and get close she takes forever to charge up her crap
[1:09:41] <Djinnazz> Naw
[1:09:42] <%freelancebabymaker> i mean its really subjective
[1:09:43] <ColdxCrush> It is easily one of the hardest lol
[1:09:43] <TheEndlessRiver1> It's definitely Top 3
[1:09:44] <DXLelouch24> Oh thats cute you think this is the hardest
[1:09:44] <%g0atmeal> hardest or at least tied for me
[1:09:48] <@commanderclaw> Oh yeah, one of the hardest, it's top 3 for sure
[1:09:48] <bowiedayko> Top 3 definitely
[1:09:48] <DXLelouch24> Its not paige
[1:09:49] <+MarkoTolstov> it's up there, imo
[1:09:50] <%Monkeyweed21> Both of these are true
[1:09:50] <%Lion_kun> friede is up there
[1:09:50] <heartlesshealer> she's mostly a bunch of learning and that's it
[1:09:51] <%Lion_kun> top 3
[1:09:52] <+JusTTheGuyYouNeed> she is up there
[1:09:53] <Eightesu> one of but not the hardest bosses Kappa
[1:09:53] <heartlesshealer> you'll get this
[1:09:53] <ColdxCrush> Midir and Gael were both easy af to me compared to this
[1:09:54] <+MisterAvry> different opinions I guess. she's tougher than Manus
[1:09:54] <+charlie2089> Its super hard
[1:09:56] <%Ziegsy> now im picturing peach with one of those giant hamster water bottles 'mlem mlem mlem'
[1:09:56] <+ThomasOfTroy> This is top 2, mostly because it's phases in a row
[1:09:57] <WhyWorry07> @WhyWorry07 is new here. Say hello! VoHiYo
[1:09:58] <%peyodogo> it's up there for me
[1:09:59] <%AncelDeLambert> this boss ends playthroughs
[1:09:59] <@PatStaresAt> If it's not it's definitely up there
[1:09:59] <metalsiren31> Easily the hardest boss for me
[1:10:03] <%That1blindkid> If you spin the camera when she jumps you can see where she lands
[1:10:07] <cidmaik> She's really Nameless King level of BS in phase 3
[1:10:08] <+RayDaug> It's only hard because it's an endurance test. Individually, the phases aren't that bad.
[1:10:08] <Blak3_Nikos> I believe it
[1:10:12] <islandsunn> you already know when to heal which is the hardest part of this fight
[1:10:13] <%JoshManVGH> 3 Phases of "Fuck your shit up" for sure tough stuff.
[1:10:18] <%peyodogo> VoHiYo
[1:10:18] <EuropanLamprey> Nameless, Friede, and you know who from the next DLC
[1:10:22] <BigYanno> Oh it's fucking up there but in this game alone there's 2 other bosses that could maybe be considered harder
[1:10:23] <Xiangchang> Stamina Bar is the ultimate boss.
[1:10:26] <%AncelDeLambert> dodge when you hear the metal
[1:10:26] <$Sphincter_Spelunker> it's mostly annoying for being one of the only bosses with 3 phases
[1:10:27] <cidmaik> THE HARDEST PART IS PHASE 2!?
[1:10:27] <@SoFarFetched> @That1blindkid lets not give advice on the  first phase. She's been told that a shitload yesterday.
[1:10:35] <heartlesshealer> Sound cues when it comes to that move
[1:10:36] <%peyodogo> @EuropanLamprey hohoho
[1:10:43] <Coystick> So it'd be Friede, Shin Godzilla, and Santa for top 3 hardest right?
[1:10:48] <Eightesu> your head dodges it with your attack animation
[1:10:50] <%ComfortableStranger> is this harder than Lugwig?
[1:10:52] <benjiFG> very nice
[1:10:52] <%That1blindkid> DLC 2 bosses just have HUGE health pools
[1:10:57] <%AncelDeLambert> oh no greed
[1:11:02] <@SoFarFetched> if Paige is gonna unga bunga,she's gonna  unga bunga geefChair
[1:11:11] <$Sphincter_Spelunker> atpCap
[1:11:13] <cidmaik> Always leave a tiny bit of stamina to roll out
[1:11:19] <BigYanno> There's an optional boss in DLC 2 that does stupid damage and has a crazy health pool
[1:11:22] <+esoteric_simp> LuL cunt
[1:11:23] <%freelancebabymaker> unga bunga is working fine
[1:11:25] <%nip_nips> just make sure to unga before bunga
[1:11:27] <Tahzani> This scene shook me the firs ttime I saw it
[1:11:30] <@commanderclaw> Barbarian Paige, in a Barbarian Rage, will destroy this boss from the Dark souls Stage!
[1:11:36] <%ComfortableStranger> @SoFarFetched basically, and she's proven she can make it work
[1:11:39] <%Agami23> she misses because of how her swing is angled and how your swing makes you duck a little bit
[1:11:39] <BigFingerRo> that's a big freeze
[1:11:39] <Jontman42> just hit with hammer
[1:11:47] <cidmaik> the problem is the damned AoE's
[1:11:47] <%g0atmeal> Yeah, next DLC is balanced for 50 vigor imo. Going 40 to 50 helped a lot for me.
[1:11:47] <happy_void> sometimes, a lady just needs to face fuck her enemies
[1:11:54] <cidmaik> way to much stuff on the ground
[1:11:55] <bowiedayko> SEND SOUPY OLD MAN TO BED
[1:12:04] <+ThomasOfTroy> Oof
[1:12:05] <M0untain_wolf> Spicy souuuup!
[1:12:05] <%freelancebabymaker> damn
[1:12:07] <bowiedayko> How many times we have to tell you old man
[1:12:08] <%nip_nips> SOUP DEFEAT
[1:12:10] <@SoFarFetched> SOUP TODAAYYYY
[1:12:12] <Eightesu> but yuria your both interrupting soup time for this old man but also keeping these two love birds away from one another
[1:12:12] <PMda2nd> 🍲
[1:12:16] <gronzen> ...So I'm revisiting after ages away, Paige has am avatar???
[1:12:17] <heartlesshealer> just rolled the wrong way, it's fine
[1:12:19] <Eightesu> Paige*
[1:12:19] <%JoshManVGH> Stop...hammer time bah dan na na na. dan na dana
[1:12:22] <%cache_22> He also takes up a ton of the screen so it's hard to see anything.
[1:12:24] <+MisterAvry> the old soup and ice Gazpacho Combo
[1:12:24] <@MistyMntns> No Soup for you
[1:12:24] <BigFingerRo> AND THERE WE HAVE IT FOLKS , THE TRIPLE HAT TRICK AND THE PERFECT 10
[1:12:26] <TurtlesAndTentacles> I bet Paige can Unga pat's bunga
[1:12:29] <@SoFarFetched> Do the method you were choosing to do yourself last time
[1:12:31] <Jontman42> I'm at soup
[1:12:31] <TheCheeseWilly> Hit him
[1:12:31] <M0untain_wolf> No Soup for you
[1:12:33] <@SoFarFetched> Cause that was working for you
[1:12:34] <cidmaik> Well at least they SHARE THE HEALTHBAR
[1:12:38] <Coystick> Maybe switching for Sadsghetti to Soup will help
[1:12:43] <+ThomasOfTroy> Soup is generally gross and overrated. There, I said it
[1:12:43] <cidmaik> Imagine if each had their own bars...
[1:12:44] <%KeiganOfAstora> Try it with Gael just one time
[1:12:54] <%JoshManVGH> She's being coy this time
[1:12:57] <krabthecrab> It's not soup, it's his chamber pot
[1:12:57] <cidmaik> and you had to kill them at almost the same time
[1:12:59] <blue8moon> god imagine if they had separate healthbars
[1:13:07] <%hewlettfan96> jesus christ
[1:13:08] <%Ranryu692> I used to live near the Soup Nazi's restaurant, but I never got any soup
[1:13:08] <%g0atmeal> @cidmaik though it might kill the pace if you get one and the phase gets easier for a while
[1:13:08] <%JoshManVGH> nay, flirty?
[1:13:10] <%ComfortableStranger> @SoFarFetched second this
[1:13:11] <BigFingerRo> Welp, I got what I wanted, I only now await more frustration and tits in the ass
[1:13:11] <TheCheeseWilly> Spank that nun Fox Dad
[1:13:18] <%sporeian94> PROTIP: To defeat Sister Friede, smack at it until it dies
[1:13:29] <@SoFarFetched> Smack that ass UNTIL ITS DONE
[1:13:32] <%Agami23> @gronzen yeah paige went full vtuber. the artist did a really good job too
[1:13:33] <TurtlesAndTentacles> Pretend she's pat's butt and give it a smack!
[1:13:33] <@Jekado> something about that backjump slash i really like.
[1:13:38] <BigFingerRo> 11
[1:13:38] <%g0atmeal> she took the scenic route lol
[1:13:41] <@SoFarFetched> You're getting there paige
[1:13:43] <+MisterAvry> does she have any elemental weaknesses?
[1:13:48] <Coystick> Stay Determined Peach
[1:13:49] <@SoFarFetched> just do what you were doing yesterday
[1:13:49] <%JoshManVGH> Ok that was a cool effect. Go invisible while backjumping into a bookcase? Superb
[1:13:55] <TheCheeseWilly> Rip and tear until it is almost done but you get dunked with soup
[1:13:57] <@commanderclaw> You're getting there, we believe in you!
[1:14:01] <gronzen> Damn... I should go watch paige's reaction to the fetus birds
[1:14:02] <+TheotherKristian> Sweet Hotness. Sister Freide best girl

[1:14:10] <metalsiren31> Her elemental weakness is steel
[1:14:11] <BigYanno> honestly maybe running away from her isn't worth it over just letting her come to you and dodging when she appears
[1:14:11] <%JoshManVGH> Bonk and Smash! Until it is done!
[1:14:13] <%g0atmeal> @MisterAvry fextralife says just strike, resistant against elements

[1:14:23] <cidmaik> @g0atmeal Peach is getting to the peak of her performance... where she crushes 1 or 2 phases... but then if she keeps losing it becomes a trainwreck where she wont see the second round

[1:14:35] <%g0atmeal> but ariandel is weak to magic
[1:14:44] <cidmaik> then if she pushes through, she will beat it
[1:14:49] <@MistyMntns> @BigFingerRo Nah I think she has it on her own

[1:18:15] <%hewlettfan96> Dark souls May have been inspired heavily by berserk
[1:18:18] <%cade_calrayn> she's already proven she's big and strong, she must prove that she is the Biggest and the Strongest
[1:18:20] <@SoFarFetched> Paige wants to kill the woman HERSELF

[1:20:18] <+CrimKangaroo> kill that woman, peach. you know you want to.
[1:20:27] <Treasure_Vault> Does DS3 have any shitty boss runs? None come to mind
[1:20:28] <%ComfortableStranger> @freelancebabymaker that must have been intentional, kind of a mercy thing
[1:20:44] <%ScrivenerJeff> Something about hearing that come from the avatar makes it so much better.
[1:20:47] <Treasure_Vault> Maybe Sage?
[1:20:49] <cidmaik> All bosses are fun
[1:20:51] <%ScrivenerJeff> RyuChamp

[1:21:33] <%freelancebabymaker> you got this paige
[1:21:34] <%ComfortableStranger> past 9
[1:21:36] <Profmcstevie> It is scientifically proven swearing and cursing helps soothe
[1:21:40] <@SoFarFetched> Paige is teaching anatomy class this whole time geefPlz
[1:21:40] <Treasure_Vault> Watch her jump real careful like
[1:21:44] <%Ziegsy> IMAGINE: you hear the clanging of bells outside, the children run and gather at the door. 'Soup! The soup man is here!' They cry. You gather up your pennies for the soup, while outside father  Ariandel drags his chair down the road.
[1:21:50] <BigFingerRo> @ComfortableStranger no no, it's 15 this stream
[1:21:51] <+ghostfaceninja_> you can do it Paige, we believe in you
[1:21:52] <wolfen091> its not 9, its 821, you're just in the wrong timezone
[1:21:55] <@SoFarFetched> uhh

[1:21:58] <%nip_nips> bow only run now
[1:22:00] <%Lion_kun> your equipment is optimized
[1:22:00] <@Jekado> take a break if you have to don't mess up your hands.

[1:22:01] <@MistyMntns> To what?
[1:22:01] <islandsunn> ember up!
[1:22:02] <BigFingerRo> I wasn't counting the last streams
[1:22:07] <%sporeian94> BARE HANDS
[1:22:08] <bowiedayko> Not now, its too late. Only unga can win
[1:22:08] <%ComfortableStranger> @ComfortableStranger no the time
[1:22:10] <fruit_pie_the_magician> Your equipment is frost resistant
[1:22:11] <benjiFG> armor doesn't matter in ds3
[1:22:12] <%Lion_kun> armor means nothing in dark souls
[1:22:12] <@SoFarFetched> BEAR HANDS
[1:22:12] <%BoxNavy> no :)
[1:22:13] <$Sphincter_Spelunker> great idea Paige atpCap
[1:22:13] <%AncelDeLambert> I mean, you have a PRETTY beefy weapon
[1:22:13] <%g0atmeal> you have some of the best equipment for this fight
[1:22:14] <@MistyMntns> A Car wheel?
[1:22:15] <peachy996> Can she not go to the Dreg Heap if she wants a change of pace?
[1:22:15] <@Jekado> if you want to mix it up you can but most of your stuff is spec to the current weapon
[1:22:16] <%g0atmeal> unequip torch
[1:22:17] <%Ashrox117> Depraved set let's go
[1:22:17] <@PatStaresAt> @peachsaliva you could but you'd have to farm souls to upgrade it
[1:22:18] <%Grimlockfly> ember up, phone a friend
[1:22:18] <BigFingerRo> BE HEAVIER
[1:22:20] <bowiedayko> Only unga, this boss is hard
[1:22:21] <%AncelDeLambert> check your box for other hammers
[1:22:21] <%femto216> Change the weapon 👀👀
[1:22:23] <+MarkoTolstov> ember up at the beginning of phase 2 @PeachSaliva
[1:22:23] <%KeiganOfAstora> How so
[1:22:23] <+MisterAvry> not much more substantial than a big fuckin hammer
[1:22:24] <benjiFG> the only stats that matter for armor are resistances
[1:22:24] <%nip_nips> gael is your protection
[1:22:26] <%BettyMwwaahh> armor doesnt really matter
[1:22:28] <%KeiganOfAstora> Weapon?
[1:22:28] <%freelancebabymaker> bigger armor could fuck up your roll
[1:22:30] <%Grimlockfly> Ask Gael to help
[1:22:30] <islandsunn> remove estus ring, replace with frostbite
[1:22:31] <TurtlesAndTentacles> ask Patman. I think you're doing fine
[1:22:32] <Melchior_the_Wise> be sure to wear your dental dam
[1:22:33] <%AncelDeLambert> top
[1:22:35] <%g0atmeal> torch is unnecessary weight
[1:22:35] <%SveriSageAdvice> unfortunately i think you have like one of the best armor sets for frost resistance
[1:22:37] <@PatStaresAt> @peachsaliva just use Gael lel
[1:22:38] <@SoFarFetched> yeah ember up
[1:22:38] <blue8moon> I don't think it'd help, dancer has frost resistance, but the other phases also have fire and dark
[1:22:38] <%BoxNavy> no >:(
[1:22:42] <cidmaik> wait... she was going in ASHEN MODE
[1:22:43] <AtisutoCurry> I spent 35 minutes listening to the plague and peach beastars podcast lmao I forgot I had the stream up as well

[1:22:48] <+MooseIsGoose> extra health may do it
[1:22:48] <+MisterAvry> oh yeah frostbite ring might be a good idea
[1:22:48] <%freelancebabymaker> you have 56 of them
[1:22:49] <islandsunn> frostbite ring!
[1:22:51] <@SoFarFetched> you got a lot of ember

[1:22:58] <%AncelDeLambert> DO IT. SUBMIT
[1:22:58] <@MistyMntns> How about Dragon Breath?
[1:22:58] <VritraReiRei> you can also use Embers as emergency healing
[1:23:00] <%king_wragles> @PeachSaliva ember should be enough
[1:23:00] <%freelancebabymaker> oh forstbite ring?

[1:24:13] <@commanderclaw> It increases HP
[1:24:14] <%BoxNavy> you get more health
[1:24:14] <TheCheeseWilly> Ember
[1:24:15] <%freelancebabymaker> it gives you more health
[1:24:15] <Coystick> Gael gang we got too cocky...
[1:24:16] <@PatStaresAt> @peachsaliva it'll give you a little more health
[1:24:17] <%Monkeyweed21> more health
[1:24:19] <cidmaik> Embered is more HP

[1:24:24] <+MooseIsGoose> Then try gayle
[1:24:25] <TheCheeseWilly> You got this
[1:24:26] <TurtlesAndTentacles> more life says the experts
[1:24:26] <$Sphincter_Spelunker> she didn't even know what ember did before she chose it atpCap
[1:24:27] <@Jekado> then gael it up
[1:24:27] <BigYanno> like an extra 10% helf
[1:24:27] <TheCheeseWilly> No summon
[1:24:28] <+MarkoTolstov> WHOA
[1:24:29] <%FacetiousAF> i think she's got some embers to spare....
[1:24:29] <TheCheeseWilly> Fuck that
[1:24:30] <%femto216> Oh nooo we lost
[1:24:31] <+charlie2089> Probs an extra hit
[1:24:31] <%doomunderthestairs> in fact I save it as a last estus sometimes
[1:24:33] <TheCheeseWilly> Yes
[1:24:33] <BluffRainbow> Hey @peachsaliva hi chat how’s everyone doing today?
[1:24:33] <@MistyMntns> Ember on the Nice Number
[1:24:34] <%freelancebabymaker> por que no las dos
[1:24:35] <%KeiganOfAstora> Why not both?
[1:24:39] <+D00msDayDan> i can't get over how the ember restored sound is also the stake driver from bloodborne
[1:24:40] <%Monkeyweed21> its like 20 or 30% health
[1:24:46] <%g0atmeal> if she summons gael, she'll win right away, might be kinda anticlimactic
[1:24:48] <BigFingerRo> Let's see if it lasts for long
[1:24:48] <blue8moon> it's soooooo biiiiiiiiig
[1:24:49] <+MooseIsGoose> Tank everything
[1:24:52] <cidmaik> Didnt she had a friend that was like... training her in the Dark Souls way
[1:24:53] <BigYanno> I love when the bar takes up more than half the screen
[1:24:54] <%TheWinged7> what a beutiful dewang *chew*
[1:24:54] <+ThomasOfTroy> 17.36% turnout with that poll. I love democracy
[1:24:58] <+ghostfaceninja_> that bar is BIG and STRONG
[1:25:01] <%nip_nips> @doomunderthestairs i usually save ember for phase transition heals on multi-part bosses
[1:25:04] <$AzureGale> Yes let's find a couple to do
[1:25:06] <cidmaik> what happened to telling her about embered mode!?
[1:25:10] <WakeofRuin> just breath man
[1:25:10] <AtisutoCurry> IIF
[1:25:16] <BigFingerRo> Peach really likes those telegraphed attacks
[1:25:17] <%KeiganOfAstora> Ember is just for more HP so things that you normally die to will now leave you with little HP instead
[1:25:17] <%mikehuntis4timmy> big bar
[1:25:18] <+slacklegend> Miss you on Dick Show
[1:25:20] <%Ashrox117> Girl what about using that shield
[1:25:27] <%ComfortableStranger> Every time Paige asks pat for help I wish he would say "Paige you don't need me"
[1:25:29] <islandsunn> boom!
[1:25:30] <Melchior_the_Wise> @slacklegend agreed
[1:25:36] <blue8moon> her shield is for stamina regen, not blocking
[1:25:39] <BigYanno> I've never learned how to dodge that double swing
[1:25:41] <%Ashrox117> Ohhh
[1:25:45] <BluffRainbow> Gotta love dark souls boss music
[1:25:47] <%doomunderthestairs> @nip_nips that too!  Super useful on this one between the second and third phase which is how I beat her this boss the first time!
[1:25:51] <AthenaAegis> Yeah, Embering at the start of phase 3 would help save on Estus. A good idea
[1:25:52] <%sporeian94> Does paige know you can see the footprints in the snow?
[1:25:53] <@Jekado> yeah that pause to break rhythm
[1:26:01] <BigFingerRo> the DODGES THO
[1:26:05] <%ComfortableStranger> Pat is Dumbo's feather, she never needed him in the first place
[1:26:10] <+slacklegend> come back on Dick Show like you used to Peach
[1:26:11] <%freelancebabymaker> nice
[1:26:12] <%ScrivenerJeff> THE READS
[1:26:13] <islandsunn> noice
[1:26:14] <@SoFarFetched> PogChamp
[1:26:17] <Dazhuko> you got this!
[1:26:19] <cidmaik> Dark Souls... the only game that 1/3 left of health means you are one hit away from dying
[1:26:19] <%femto216> @bigyanno I've never learned how to roll
[1:26:21] <%Agami23> damn, baited her out and everything. sick
[1:26:29] <%SMuffinMan> @sporeian94 She watched her jump down in front of her several times when she turns around and ignores her lol
[1:26:30] <%g0atmeal> oh my god
[1:26:33] <WakeofRuin> sick
[1:26:36] <+slacklegend> miss u hard
[1:26:44] <+Caped_Eggy> He missed LUL
[1:26:44] <+MarkoTolstov> @PeachSaliva since embers are also full heals, i recommend NOT embering until phase 2. That way, you can have full health and bigger HP for the real fight.
[1:26:45] <BigFingerRo> sweet 16
[1:26:47] <%doomunderthestairs> awwww man
[1:26:47] <%nip_nips> TAG HIM IN

[1:26:50] <%cade_calrayn> GAEL GANG RISE UP
[1:26:51] <%AncelDeLambert> YAAAAAY GIVE UPS!

[1:26:57] <%BoxNavy> yeyeye
[1:26:58] <%doomunderthestairs> you can try sacing the ember after the second phase
[1:27:01] <Melchior_the_Wise> This boss is really hard Tho
[1:27:01] <JayCantDo> GAEL
[1:27:02] <WakeofRuin> BibleThump BibleThump BibleThump
[1:27:02] <%Agami23> i just noticed something. when you get hit by ariandels fire, you lose the frostbite effect
[1:27:02] <Treasure_Vault> This boss fight is real tough
[1:27:02] <%king_wragles> *super far
[1:27:02] <%nip_nips> the devs expect you to use gael thats why he doesnt need an ember
[1:27:02] <sendart> yeyeye
[1:27:02] <@Jekado> GAEL FORCE time!
[1:27:03] <%Ranryu692> Ranryu692 subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 23 months! Hello today from a different side of the Atlantic than usual! You've got this Sister Friede fight;  I believe in you! Also woo! almost 2 years of subbing! That is, of subscribing; I've been subbing all my life! Ugh that was terrible, I'll see myself out

[1:27:03] <%freelancebabymaker> GAEL IS YOUR FRIEND LET HIM HELP
[1:27:04] <+Chewygamer> Yo what you have to do is hit it very hard
[1:27:05] <islandsunn> FROSTBITE RING
[1:27:05] <BigYanno> Just having a second target in phase 2 is SO useful
[1:27:06] <+slacklegend> it does suck
[1:27:08] <+MooseIsGoose> You do not
[1:27:09] <+lethallunacyx> !uptime
[1:27:10] <BigFingerRo> You need ember to summon
[1:27:10] <benjiFG> nope
[1:27:11] <BigYanno> no
[1:27:12] <+MooseIsGoose> but do it for fun
[1:27:13] <+MisterAvry> but if you get Gael how can I hope to beat her without Gael? You're my hero Paige
[1:27:14] <sirrice77> No gael is special
[1:27:14] <WakeofRuin> PJSalt PJSalt PJSalt PJSalt PJSalt
[1:27:15] <cidmaik> To see em you need to be embered no
[1:27:17] <@commanderclaw> Gael is a fun man with a neat plan
[1:27:17] <%KeiganOfAstora> Gael is here for you and it's fun
[1:27:17] <%Grimlockfly> The whole point is embers for summon
[1:27:17] <@PatStaresAt> @peachsaliva hes the only free summon in dark souls history
[1:27:17] <WhyWorry07> Jolly Cooperation@
[1:27:18] <%Monkeyweed21> @PeachSaliva Pat didnt even get to phase 3 without Gael lol
[1:27:18] <%AncelDeLambert> where IS he? I didn't notice his sign
[1:27:20] <+ghostfaceninja_> Gael, ASSIST ME! doodmaxhype
[1:27:23] <%g0atmeal> gael is special, no ember needed
[1:27:26] <%Lion_kun> ember anyway, take every advantage
[1:27:28] <%GabeSweetMan> LUL
[1:27:30] <happy_void> good guy Gael, the man you can trust
[1:27:31] <TheCheeseWilly> No you got this
[1:27:37] <WhyWorry07> Eyy :D
[1:27:38] <TheCheeseWilly> We saw you almost had it
[1:27:38] <%JoshManVGH> So I just got to a level in Gears of War 2 in which the objective was "Avoid the digestive teeth"... I'm queasy...
[1:27:39] <%AncelDeLambert> Unta binta Solo, ho ho ho
[1:27:41] <%nip_nips> this is the run
[1:27:42] <+ThomasOfTroy> Yeah, but pat's bad at video games
[1:27:42] <@Jekado> really the fight is so hard they make it so you don't need embered? geefThink
[1:27:43] <benjiFG> @PatStaresAt dusk haha
[1:27:43] <@PatStaresAt> I know how to give up like a pro!
[1:27:43] <%doomunderthestairs> ember after second phase then
[1:27:44] <%KeiganOfAstora> But ember gives more HP and you have a ton of them...
[1:27:45] <%doomunderthestairs> it will help
[1:27:48] <$AzureGale> nyannMegalul
[1:27:48] <+slacklegend> but what would suck more would be you not being on tds again
[1:27:55] <%nip_nips> he comes in phase 2
[1:27:56] <+MooseIsGoose> In phase 2
[1:27:57] <TheEndlessRiver1> PHASE 2
[1:27:58] <%Lion_kun> he summons in phase 2
[1:27:58] <%AncelDeLambert> oh okay
[1:27:59] <$cgreene64> he summons in phase 2
[1:27:59] <%freelancebabymaker> yeah lol
[1:27:59] <%king_wragles> Ya it's fine
[1:28:00] <@SoFarFetched> Pat's been practicing giving up for years geefPlz
[1:28:00] <TheEndlessRiver1> oops caps
[1:28:02] <+cdrom321> He just won't show up now.
[1:28:04] <%g0atmeal> in your hour of need, he will arrive
[1:28:04] <BigYanno> click yes
[1:28:04] <%freelancebabymaker> hes a special summon
[1:28:04] <sirrice77> Gael only shows up at phase 2 onward
[1:28:05] <+MisterAvry> instead of right now beside you
[1:28:05] <%KeiganOfAstora> THANKS FOR SPOILING IT CHAT
[1:28:06] <blue8moon> still gotta first phase her
[1:28:06] <+slacklegend> plees come back on tds
[1:28:07] <%AncelDeLambert> that's weird
[1:28:13] <%king_wragles> You have phase 1 down, don't worry
[1:28:16] <%hewlettfan96> What a DILLLDO
[1:28:17] <+slacklegend> we miss u
[1:28:22] <%doomunderthestairs> I actually had no clue he only shows up on second phase
[1:28:22] <@commanderclaw> A Dark Souls Dildo sounds bad and crusty
[1:28:22] <TurtlesAndTentacles> don't call him a dildo.... yet lol
[1:28:24] <%freelancebabymaker> he shows up late so he can actually help lol
[1:28:25] <BigFingerRo> @king_wragles DON'T JINX IT
[1:28:25] <%JoshManVGH> Sacrifice 3 masters to special summon Gael in Attack Mode
[1:28:28] <BigYanno> Trust me you want him to have all his health in phase 2
[1:28:36] <@SoFarFetched> chat? Spoiling stuff? UNHEARD OF
[1:28:38] <%KeiganOfAstora> It woulda been cool to have him show up when you least expect it
[1:28:39] <%CollinsOfBodom> yep
[1:28:39] <%doomunderthestairs> makes sense
[1:28:43] <%patriotrenegade> What attempt is this
[1:28:47] <%superc37> its not a spoiler tho
[1:28:51] <%JobbedBone> I bet if there was a dark souls dildo, everyone would tell you you're using it wrong
[1:28:52] <BigFingerRo> @patriotrenegade 17
[1:28:53] <%freelancebabymaker> @patriotrenegade 17?
[1:28:53] <%superc37> its like
[1:28:53] <%nip_nips> this is attempt 354
[1:28:54] <%SMuffinMan> @patriotrenegade Lost count
[1:28:58] <$Sphincter_Spelunker> Bet the Dark Souls dildo is Kirk
[1:29:00] <+MooseIsGoose> Almost
[1:29:02] <@SoFarFetched> @superc37 jokes are hard to translate in text
[1:29:04] <WhyWorry07> You can see the footprints in the snow if you look close
[1:29:07] <+ThomasOfTroy> @JobbedBone That'd be on the box tbh
[1:29:16] <Treasure_Vault> She'll figure out the jump trick one day.
[1:29:17] <%superc37> not even close to being improtant enoguh to be considered a spoiler
[1:29:19] <%g0atmeal> the dark souls dildo isn't even that hard, i beat it on the first try
[1:29:21] <Treasure_Vault> Maybe not today, but one day.
[1:29:31] <@commanderclaw> I think you have to dodge towards her when she disappears, not away
[1:29:33] <%KeiganOfAstora> Honestly, I hate that move too and also get caught in it nearly every time
[1:29:38] <%SMuffinMan> @whyworry07 Cut out the middle man. She always drops directly behind you on your 6.
[1:29:42] <%femto216> This fight in online Co-Op is so fun, gangbanging poor sister
[1:29:44] <BigYanno> I don't think Paige understands that Friede is jumping behind her, not teleporting randomly
[1:29:47] <Treasure_Vault> HIT HER
[1:29:48] <%SMuffinMan> No footprints needed
[1:29:51] <BluffRainbow> @jobbedbone it’s easy to use the dark souls dildo, just drop your shield Kappa
[1:29:54] <%Lion_kun> HIT HERRRRR
[1:29:56] <cidmaik> Wait... is this the fight to see who's the better ice wielder?
[1:29:57] <blue8moon> that wind-up
[1:29:58] <TurtlesAndTentacles> but why no hit when see lol
[1:29:58] <BigYanno> You can knock her out of that move
[1:30:00] <@PatStaresAt> @peachsaliva hit her lol
[1:30:05] <%KeiganOfAstora> You have so much HP though now
[1:30:06] <Treasure_Vault> If you see her charging, hit her instead of rolling eight times
[1:30:09] <%freelancebabymaker> yeah the whole jump behind thing has only gotten on paiges nerves
[1:30:10] <BigFingerRo> @PatStaresAt WOOLIE YOU HAVE TO HIT HER
[1:30:11] <%nip_nips> HIT THE WOMAN
[1:30:13] <%g0atmeal> she is a nice lady
[1:30:13] <sendart> less rolling more unga
[1:30:13] <%doomunderthestairs> I like this cutscene

[1:30:16] <LaughingCatt> hit her Lisa
[1:30:16] <%GabeSweetMan> NAAHHHT
[1:30:16] <fruit_pie_the_magician> The only time Paige won't hit her is when there aren't any consequences
[1:30:16] <+MisterAvry> you have to hit her
[1:30:18] <WhyWorry07> Oh hi mark :D
[1:30:19] <+ghostfaceninja_> oh hi Mark

[1:30:24] <EuropanLamprey> Paige if you see her during her invisible wind up you can knock her out of it
[1:30:25] <AthenaAegis> lmao
[1:30:26] <+MooseIsGoose> Lol
[1:30:26] <+MisterAvry> hitting the woman is the only way

[1:34:36] <%GabeSweetMan> Yup
[1:34:37] <+ghostfaceninja_> YEP
[1:34:37] <BigYanno> So unlike the watchdogs of farron this boss isn't free even with a summon
[1:34:39] <%KeiganOfAstora> It's the canon battle
[1:34:40] <Treasure_Vault> @PeachSaliva You can drink twice in a row! Spam the estus button now and try
[1:34:42] <+MooseIsGoose> You did dang good
[1:34:43] <TurtlesAndTentacles> I really thought you had that shit
[1:34:45] <%MacDoodle16> YEP
[1:34:46] <RoseManor> trying attacking
[1:34:47] <+slacklegend> seems like impossible without
[1:34:47] <TheButtravage> @PeachSaliva Try using your weapon art sometimes too, might help.
[1:34:47] <+MisterAvry> Use Gael or no avail
[1:34:47] <%wibbwobbler> wooow
[1:34:49] <%AncelDeLambert> loady?
[1:34:52] <%GabeSweetMan> I ABSOLUTELY used Gael to beat this. Could not beat this solo myself.
[1:34:54] <+MarkoTolstov> they misspelled lost LUL
[1:34:54] <%freelancebabymaker> its a typo lol
[1:34:54] <%BoxNavy> loadie :)
[1:34:55] <Treasure_Vault> You did real good
[1:34:55] <mr_saturday93> Damage duh
[1:34:55] <@SoFarFetched> they meant lost
[1:34:58] <+CrimKangaroo> The ungest of bungas
[1:34:58] <TurtlesAndTentacles> loady?
[1:34:58] <@SoFarFetched> they typo'd
[1:34:59] <%MarylandJutsu> USE GALE OR PERISH
[1:35:00] <peachy996> Gael is important in this DLC so it's no problem if you ask for his help
[1:35:01] <%doomunderthestairs> it took a while but I did manage on my lonesome
[1:35:01] <%Sotetsu> You're doing it!
[1:35:02] <BigYanno> Next try, you got this
[1:35:04] <PMda2nd> almost won
[1:35:05] <@PatStaresAt> @PeachSaliva It really feels like a challenge run type boss for masochists without Gael
[1:35:05] <+MisterAvry> loda? belter?
[1:35:06] <Coystick> Must be Zoomer slang
[1:35:07] <%thatbrownguy64> Good run at it, you can do it

[1:35:10] <WhyWorry07> Good fight ^^
[1:35:10] <fruit_pie_the_magician> Dear Loady
[1:35:10] <+cvp5127> they tried
[1:35:10] <EuropanLamprey> The biggest advantage of a summon is not the extra damage, it's the fact the boss sometimes is looking at someone else
[1:35:13] <BigFingerRo> That's 17, one more try and it's legal!
[1:35:14] <blue8moon> I think they were try to say lost?
[1:35:15] <%AncelDeLambert> oh, his hand was off position. "Lost"
[1:35:15] <%mikehuntis4timmy> its means BIG AND STRONG
[1:35:17] <TurtlesAndTentacles> can we use that as term for now on? loady?

[1:35:30] <@commanderclaw> I beat it myself and I don't recommend it, fighting with gael is neato
[1:35:32] <BigYanno> This boss without gael is really fucking hard with slow weapons
[1:35:32] <+MooseIsGoose> I only beat this solo when I overleveled the crap out of my guy
[1:35:32] <blue8moon> paige is very big and strong
[1:35:34] <TurtlesAndTentacles> we she wins in chanting Loady
[1:35:37] <%AncelDeLambert> After this urining, we'll be riiiiiiiight back!

[2:12:54] <@PatStaresAt> Keigan the strength scaling on this shit is terrible
[2:12:56] <Dunmarkh> she sells a good weapon
[2:12:56] <lotharrio> Well she said as much.
[2:12:56] <peachy996> This is one of the few woman you don't want to kill
[2:12:57] <penitentpendant> @whyskeywolfe Not directly. It's implied to keep the darkness/'root wings' in check. Which is showcased in this zone.
[2:12:57] <heartlesshealer> well she just said
[2:12:58] <%nip_nips> STEAL HER BUTTERSCOTCH
[2:13:01] <BigYanno> She has the splitleaf greatsword which is a fun weapon
[2:13:01] <DancesWitBalrog> I DEMAND BUTTERSCOTCH
[2:13:01] <Magicferret> She says she doesn't have anything but she has an awesome weapon
[2:13:07] <fruit_pie_the_magician> That splitleaf sword is a meme
[2:13:09] <%BoxNavy> is she the lady that narrated the intro?
[2:13:12] <%g0atmeal> just set every stat to 99
[2:13:20] <NeroInfinite> She told you she had nothing
[2:13:21] <luftraumm1> awesome dialogue
[2:13:23] <+tigerfang86> damn....
[2:13:26] <$Sphincter_Spelunker> no but ok
[2:13:27] <SiriusLeeLost> BITCH, WE KNOW YOU HAVE RIBBON CANDY STASHED IN THERE!!!!
[2:13:27] <+whyskeywolfe> A god of crap, maybe.
[2:13:34] <Coystick> Endless expanse of ultra rubble
[2:13:37] <heartlesshealer> so look at all the world falling into itself
[2:13:39] <%freelancebabymaker> god i love this game
[2:13:46] <%RealThiele> Langoliers are busy pac-manning Anor londo

[2:14:01] <+whyskeywolfe> Oh man I had a cavity a while back. NOT A JOKE.
[2:14:07] <+MarkoTolstov> the atmosphere and lore to these types of game is something i aspire to create, it's phenomenal
[2:14:20] <@PatStaresAt> @PeachSaliva Because this DLC is last timewise, at this point the entire planet has basically been crushed into this spot
[2:14:21] <luftraumm1> wait isn't the demon prince lorian fought the old demon?
[2:14:25] <Coystick> Rude
[2:14:32] <+tigerfang86> Gael the bro

[2:14:40] <+whyskeywolfe> @luftraumm1 yeah but shhhh shhhhhhh
[2:14:40] <%Monkeyweed21> Gael will show you the way
[2:14:45] <%patriotrenegade> Take the plunge
[2:14:52] <lotharrio> Lots of ash to cushion your fall.
[2:14:54] <amused_platypus> Paige are you ever going to play ff14?
[2:14:54] <%freelancebabymaker> @PeachSaliva lots of long falls in this area that dont actually hurt you
[2:15:04] <+tigerfang86> SPIN IT
[2:15:05] <$AzureGale> SO SMOOTH
[2:15:07] <peachy996> if the earth was flat as paper, this is someone crunching it up into a ball
[2:15:14] <%g0atmeal> watching this is making me wanna go use the scythe again lol

[2:15:31] <%vVAstrAVv> something's going alright
[2:15:36] <%g0atmeal> scythe has a sweet spot
[2:15:41] <%Lion_kun> try other moves
[2:15:46] <%freelancebabymaker> youve used it for two minutes
[2:15:47] <+tupacula1996> HEAL
[2:15:49] <%TheWinged7> just beause its not heavy doesnt make it not good
[2:15:50] <bevyrage> you have to hit them at the blade's reach, not at the pommel
[2:15:51] <+cvp5127> paige needs unga
[2:15:52] <heartlesshealer> she stayed away from the summoner
[2:15:52] <%RealThiele> local V-tuber gets boned
[2:15:52] <BigYanno> Heal for the love of christ
[2:15:53] <+babushkakoi> It's great for stun-locking
[2:15:54] <%optimasmaximas> youre unga bunga course you say that
[2:15:54] <+tupacula1996> !
[2:15:55] <$Sphincter_Spelunker> change bad

[2:16:00] <TurtlesAndTentacles> you've used it for 2 seconds
[2:16:00] <%BoxNavy> this dude has a billion health
[2:16:01] <peachy996> Knew you would miss hammer
[2:16:02] <+tigerfang86> Change bad, or is it???
[2:16:03] <+babushkakoi> You're just used to big solo hits
[2:16:06] <@SoFarFetched> WE VOTED WITH  DEMOCRACY geefDense
[2:16:08] <+whyskeywolfe> You got him right where you want him
[2:16:09] <strugglesv> these enemies are just really trough
[2:16:09] <BigYanno> Hammer would NOT help here
[2:16:12] <AMajorTom> You're a DEXer now
[2:16:13] <mr_saturday93> Remember those things on his head?
[2:16:14] <%freelancebabymaker> LOOK AT THAT STUNLOCK
[2:16:14] <@PatStaresAt> @PeachSaliva You're doing more damage to them with this than hammor
[2:16:14] <+NateyBeak> oooh that stun lock
[2:16:14] <VritraReiRei> Paige cant UNGA anymore FeelsBadMan
[2:16:14] <EuropanLamprey> If you're not using the WA, this weapon is not great
[2:16:15] <%AncelDeLambert> use spell scythe
[2:16:17] <+lordericter> its sure not gobbling your stamina like the hammer
[2:16:22] <lotharrio> She misses the stun lock with hammer.
[2:16:22] <Arweynn> use dual wield
[2:16:22] <+chase959> I knew she was just weebing out over the scythe. She needs the unga bunga strength
[2:16:23] <Coystick> DO MORE THAN R1
[2:16:23] <%RealThiele> yeah hammer is big and safe
[2:16:23] <%AncelDeLambert> Paige, he's just huge
[2:16:26] <%SveriSageAdvice> definitely try some of the other attacks Paige
[2:16:26] <benjiFG> these guys are just super tough
[2:16:26] <%cade_calrayn> @SoFarFetched and we saw how that turned out with the ending of the Age of Fire, didn't we?
[2:16:26] <%That1blindkid> This dlc is super stacked health wise
[2:16:26] <bevyrage> you're hitting them with the handle instead of the blade paige
[2:16:26] <%geekjacob> hammer would not save you here
[2:16:26] <NeroInfinite> you gotta use L@
[2:16:27] <$AzureGale> nyannMegalul
[2:16:28] <+FoolsArcade> use teh L2
[2:16:30] <+So_I_Started_Blasting> try that L2 button
[2:16:31] <+NateyBeak> peach omg you are stunlocking a guy who usually unga bunga's me
[2:16:33] <BigYanno> Nah, these guys just have stupid HP
[2:16:34] <%superc37> @PeachSaliva paige thats bc you dont do the playstyle that it require
[2:16:38] <cooldude69xx> The best weapon is the one you're most comfortable with
[2:16:39] <%AncelDeLambert> LOOK HOW FAST
[2:16:39] <%BoxNavy> that was cool
[2:16:39] <heartlesshealer> there you go
[2:16:39] <TurtlesAndTentacles> THERE YOU GO
[2:16:42] <%SveriSageAdvice> beautiful there we go
[2:16:43] <%Agami23> these enemies actually just have stupid defense
[2:16:45] <+lordericter> also yeah the second scythe is most the dps
[2:16:45] <%peyodogo> gotta use more of the moveset
[2:16:45] <Coystick> Give it a chance Ma'am
[2:16:49] <@PatStaresAt> @PeachSaliva you're doing so much damage that you stunlocked a guy that stomps most people
[2:16:49] <Indigo_Automaton> The scythe is very good, you just have to get used to it
[2:16:51] <BigYanno> There is a trick to one shot them though
[2:16:52] <+tigerfang86> S p e e d
[2:16:54] <%freelancebabymaker> just give it a bit longer
[2:16:57] <+whyskeywolfe> You're doing totes fine.
[2:16:58] <%GabeSweetMan> Is Soul of Cinder's location not chronologically after this? I always thought [SPOILER]'s fight is the actual definitive dead last event in the timeline even after SoC. Something something flow of time convoluted etc.
[2:16:59] <%Monkeyweed21> SPEED UNGA
[2:17:02] <@SoFarFetched> @cade_calrayn Honestly her betraying the poll AND doing the betrayal with the ending was pretty worked perfectly geefO
[2:17:08] <@SoFarFetched> it was the BIGGEST betrayal of an ending
[2:17:12] <%patriotrenegade> That dagger is neat
[2:17:13] <hakumaribo> jesus christ Paige, your stun locking it, eery 3rd or 4th hit, most people cant even do that!!!
[2:17:13] <Dunmarkh> cool dagger
[2:17:13] <Indigo_Automaton> You can totally use that dagger too
[2:17:14] <%AncelDeLambert> LUL she has the build for that dagger, now
[2:17:15] <BigYanno> The aquamarine dagger is SO FUCKING COOL
[2:17:16] <%cade_calrayn> She betrayed even herself
[2:17:16] <%g0atmeal> this dlc has incredible str weapons too if you prefer
[2:17:17] <@SoFarFetched> she not only betrayed us,but also the LADY
[2:17:18] <fruit_pie_the_magician> sometimes, you have to see what people do and like, respond to it
[2:17:19] <%cade_calrayn> It was classic Paige
[2:17:23] <%vVAstrAVv> that dagger is bonkersss btw
[2:17:26] <+MooseIsGoose> that dagger has a cool moveset if want to look
[2:17:26] <SiriusLeeLost> Revert back to your Bloodborne mindset.  QUICK, remember the basics of CQC!!!
[2:17:28] <%SophiaAmoreaVeritas> This style is meant more for combining several different moves, I think.
[2:17:28] <Indigo_Automaton> Try theat dagger, it's dope as fuck
[2:17:29] <%That1blindkid> that dagger is a lightsaber
[2:17:32] <gronzen> God I was gone for a hot minute and oh neat, she's here!
[2:17:32] <Coystick> Scythe's have a sweet spot in their range for max damage, you don't have to bet right up in their face, try hitting from a few feet away
[2:17:33] <%doomunderthestairs> yeah like I thought it doesn't fit peaches unga bunga playstyle but at least she try
[2:17:33] <%superc37> the dagger i kinda dogshit tho
[2:17:46] <+realm_forge> You were mashing the potatoes now you’re slicing them
[2:17:46] <+charlie2089> lightsaber dagger
[2:17:51] <+Gcvftw> Dex weapons are all about the quick hits and dodge.  Compared to full swings like the hammer.  It also has the ability to freeze.
[2:17:53] <+tigerfang86> DEX BOIZ
[2:17:53] <%rumtumtugnutz> I like how VPaige has the "no thoughts ever" look perpetually.
[2:17:54] <+whyskeywolfe> You're a freaking god of death.
[2:17:56] <bevyrage> hey look, doubled the damage because you hit the guy with your blade 'stead of the pole
[2:17:56] <%BoxNavy> it good :)
[2:18:05] <@SoFarFetched> Paige is no longer unga bunga,she  is only unga
[2:18:07] <%nip_nips> JEBAITED

[2:18:42] <Coystick> It's some kind of... DARK STRANDING
[2:18:45] <%RealThiele> skelemans abound
[2:18:50] <Vithaeria> aaah i love this dlc
[2:18:52] <+Ne1son> WHAT CAN THE HARVEST HOPE FOR, IF NOT FOR THE CARE OF THE REAPER-PAIGE
[2:18:52] <+Dives__> Damn ankle biters
[2:18:54] <%KeiganOfAstora> hold L2 and spam R2
[2:19:02] <@SoFarFetched> Ahhh the lost forbidden fanfiction section
[2:19:03] <Vithaeria> especially for Peach
[2:19:03] <%g0atmeal> scythe does ~2x damage if you hit with the blade
[2:19:07] <%optimasmaximas> @Coystick the first strand type enemy
[2:19:09] <%GabeSweetMan> Whelp
[2:19:09] <luftraumm1> bonk

[2:19:13] <%freelancebabymaker> give it a bit longer
[2:19:14] <BigYanno> This place is trap central
[2:19:15] <+FoolsArcade> you're doing good for not being use to it tho
[2:19:16] <heartlesshealer> gotta make it two weapons
[2:19:18] <@SoFarFetched> not so unga,not so bunga
[2:19:20] <%patriotrenegade> Squishy?
[2:19:21] <@PatStaresAt> @PeachSaliva Scythe also does bonus damage if you hit with the blade
[2:19:21] <DancesWitBalrog> trap room
[2:19:21] <BigYanno> you ARE strong tho
[2:19:23] <penitentpendant> She craves the Bunga
[2:19:24] <%nip_nips> this dlc makes you feel not as strong with any build
[2:19:26] <%AncelDeLambert> you do SO MUCH damage when you hold L2
[2:19:26] <%SophiaAmoreaVeritas> Give it thirty minutes.
[2:19:28] <%doomunderthestairs> humanity everywhere
[2:19:29] <%RealThiele> LUL
[2:19:31] <benjiFG> but paige loves facefucking
[2:19:31] <Coystick> You are strong, just make sure to hit with the scythe's blade and not the pole!
[2:19:34] <BigYanno> these guys are just tough
[2:19:34] <fruit_pie_the_magician> interestingly, this build also works with the immolation tinder, the best weapon ever
[2:19:39] <%GabeSweetMan> The Age of Unga is Over. But Bunga lives on in our hearts and in our Scythe.
[2:19:43] <%Monkeyweed21> @PeachSaliva if you get far enough in this DLC there is an even bigger stronger hammer
[2:19:43] <@PatStaresAt> immolation tinder?
[2:19:44] <%JobbedBone> or does it do less damage if you hit with the stick?
[2:19:56] <benjiFG> the thing the fire mages in irithyll use
[2:19:59] <%GabeSweetMan> That poor dead bastard lol
[2:20:12] <%doomunderthestairs> yeah I was hoping she would elvole to larger hamma
[2:20:13] <%g0atmeal> immolation tinder is my fav dating app
[2:20:17] <%KeiganOfAstora> immolation tinder
[2:20:18] <Coystick> That RANGE tho
[2:20:21] <@SoFarFetched> That dead body is being taken for a ride everytime paige falls
[2:20:24] <fruit_pie_the_magician> @PatStaresAt Its that thing those pyro guys in Irathyll use
[2:20:26] <%AncelDeLambert> good, now RUUUUUUN
[2:20:27] <%nip_nips> time for the attack helicopters

[2:20:39] <Indigo_Automaton> @PatStaresAt It's a catalyst that can be used as melee but the scythes are better. She picked up the lightsaber dagger which she can use too
[2:20:39] <Magicferret> Angels with LASERS!

[2:30:31] <+Amakuni1> Sekiro is one of the easier souls games though
[2:30:32] <%Mr_Pylon> Do not mention the Scottish Souls!
[2:30:32] <%g0atmeal> yeah demon's would be really easy after all this
[2:30:38] <%GabeSweetMan> HESITATION IS DEFEAT
[2:30:39] <cooldude69xx> Sekiros die four-ice
[2:30:40] <sirrice77> @MarylandJutsu you can actually just spam the parry button and do fine for most of it but her wrists probably can't do that either
[2:30:40] <dmitSteve> shadows die four times?
[2:30:42] <%Ziegsy> what about nioh?
[2:30:42] <fruit_pie_the_magician> Sekiro is esoteric and demands precise timing
[2:30:45] <$Sphincter_Spelunker> @Amakuni1 if you have normal relfexes
[2:30:46] <lotharrio> When you die in Sekiro... you die in real life!
[2:30:47] <%MarylandJutsu> Demons souls is a whole nother level
[2:30:55] <%MarylandJutsu> @sirrice77 also true
[2:30:59] <+ThomasOfTroy> What about DS2 DLC?
[2:31:02] <%cache_22> Demon's Souls would be fun.
[2:31:02] <%SophiaAmoreaVeritas> That's fine, boycott Activision.
[2:31:03] <happy_void> This is probably the hardest DLC fromsoft has ever made IMO
[2:31:06] <%patriotrenegade> eh you aint mising a bunch
[2:31:09] <%KeiganOfAstora> Go to the left
[2:31:09] <%g0atmeal> nioh is harder than anything from fromsoft imo
[2:31:11] <mr_saturday93> Magic pixel
[2:31:14] <%Idziman> THE LUCK
[2:31:17] <%cade_calrayn> STOP MENTIONING SEKIRO PAIGE
[2:31:17] <churropoppa> sekiro is just a rhythm game
[2:31:18] <+KojiColnair> I really didn't enjoy sekiro, Liked all the toher ones
[2:31:18] <%pokefan9956> I'm trying to think of good stuff that pat hasn't played
[2:31:18] <%nip_nips> gawdam
[2:31:20] <%vVAstrAVv> demon souls is fine once you can infuse a dagger to get through the hallways
[2:31:25] <%Grimlockfly> no new path
[2:31:26] <Coystick> Nioh is still on my list
[2:31:28] <%GabeSweetMan> Why no heal paige
[2:31:28] <%Grimlockfly> new path back there
[2:31:28] <Treasure_Vault> BLIND
[2:31:31] <%g0atmeal> unless you cheese with kusarigama
[2:31:32] <digaogrunge> HEAL
[2:31:33] <%pokefan9956> stuff that'd be up Paige's alley
[2:31:33] <%freelancebabymaker> KILL THE SLUG THING
[2:31:33] <+FoolsArcade> BLIND
[2:31:34] <%MarylandJutsu> @vVAstrAVv or just choose the royal starting class
[2:31:34] <%Monkeyweed21> KILL THING
[2:31:35] <+tigerfang86> THAT THING PAIGE
[2:31:36] <Treasure_Vault> KILL SLUG
[2:31:39] <BigYanno> KILL IT
[2:31:39] <%KeiganOfAstora> Oh my god
[2:31:39] <Treasure_Vault> Ok double blind
[2:31:40] <penitentpendant> Thing Unkilled
[2:31:41] <%KeiganOfAstora> Kill the thing
[2:31:42] <%patriotrenegade> @PeachSaliva theres a new path back there that you DEFINITELY want to go down
[2:31:43] <Treasure_Vault> Incredible
[2:31:43] <LaughingCatt> lobosKek
[2:31:43] <bevyrage> psaBlind
[2:31:44] <@MistyMntns> @churropoppa Honestly I never thought of it that way.
[2:31:47] <%KeiganOfAstora> LMFAO
[2:31:47] <%Ziegsy> Nioh is alot of fun as a ninja build
[2:31:48] <+tupacula1996> HEAL
[2:31:48] <lotharrio> Is she running past  second bro?
[2:32:00] <%GabeSweetMan> HEALTH PAIGE
[2:32:01] <%nip_nips> shes not going down the path that hes on
[2:32:06] <bevyrage> i also wanna point out that iirc firelink armor is not resistant to dark at all
[2:32:09] <lotharrio> SIP
[2:32:09] <+BoboDaHobo> sekiro is just a high speed bop-it game, sucha
[2:32:10] <sirrice77> Nioh is not any harder than souls games just different in some fundamental ways
[2:32:10] <T_Sasquatch> Ma'am drink your sunny D
[2:32:12] <BigYanno> Paaaaaaaaaaaaaaaat Paige is playing the game wrooooooooooooooong

[2:35:34] <%GabeSweetMan> This place has ZERO Chill.

[2:35:36] <fruit_pie_the_magician> Its literally the only thing you can do
[2:35:37] <%nip_nips> GO OUT THE BROKEN WALL IN THE CHAPEL

[2:36:17] <%Agami23> the angels used to be so much worse, they would have WAY stronger accuracy and just instantly hit you with 5 beams
[2:36:17] <%KeiganOfAstora> That totally works
[2:36:18] <%doomunderthestairs> not that one at least
[2:36:18] <+tigerfang86> DO COMBO
[2:36:19] <%GabeSweetMan> Dark Souls remains the KING of incredible hit boxes.

[2:42:03] <$Quack_of_Dawn> Unfortunately Lapp is bound to the DLC
[2:42:04] <UnImprest> cant, he on a mission
[2:42:05] <%GabeSweetMan> He's restricted to DLC only.
[2:42:05] <%king_wragles> You can punch him in the face cause Patches is an asshole
[2:42:06] <%doomunderthestairs> yep best fran

[2:42:48] <%Reaped_Psyche> I think showing up works.
[2:42:50] <%SMuffinMan> Boneward Home Bone
[2:42:51] <lotharrio> It's just faster
[2:42:54] <%g0atmeal> he's so thicc

[2:43:03] <%GabeSweetMan> Well that works. Just the slow way.

[2:43:24] <Klefth> A fucking slab...
[2:43:28] <benjiFG> this really is a earthen peak ruins
[2:43:35] <%KeiganOfAstora> @That1blindkid It's just the same style. You get their armor later
[2:43:36] <+SciFiBrony> Paige is in for a rude awakening if this is who I think it is 😆
[2:43:36] <%g0atmeal> @KeiganOfAstora the nice lady with the marbles
[2:43:37] <%doomunderthestairs> yeah it does look like the ruin set a bit
[2:43:37] <Dunmarkh> @WutangchickeN would have been less loading screens.
[2:43:39] <%freelancebabymaker> @KeiganOfAstora the angel thing lol
[2:43:43] <happy_void> the old turtle lady
[2:43:47] <%doomunderthestairs> the actual set is in here somewhere
[2:43:47] <$Sphincter_Spelunker> chat atpCap shut up
[2:43:48] <%KeiganOfAstora> Ha I got two different answers
[2:43:49] <%patriotrenegade> ok go fight angel
[2:43:50] <sirrice77> @KeiganOfAstora i assumed the angel because i would shoot at him too
[2:43:54] <%That1blindkid> @SciFiBrony check your whispers
[2:43:56] <Treasure_Vault> Go forward, or finish exploring behind you
[2:44:09] <%BoxNavy> jermaThing
[2:44:15] <@MistyMntns> Angel sounds just like the Grudge
[2:44:16] <%freelancebabymaker> fucking grudge noises
[2:44:17] <BigYanno> It moves BTW
[2:44:19] <%g0atmeal> i just realized the new armor won't look good when you're hollow :(
[2:44:21] <%nip_nips> angel does so little damage now
[2:44:23] <DancesWitBalrog> Sadako death rattle
[2:44:24] <+WutangchickeN> GEE WILLIKERS
[2:44:26] <%patriotrenegade> @PeachSaliva They used to do triple damage before they got nerfed
[2:44:33] <%KeiganOfAstora> Did FromSoft ever say if the Angels was their attempt at forcing you to use stealth. Maybe a test for Sekiro?
[2:44:36] <%GabeSweetMan> GOLLY JEE WILLICKERS
[2:44:37] <%Monkeyweed21> oh man this is nothing compared to launch angels
[2:44:39] <UnImprest> Its so majestic Kappa
[2:44:39] <+Mictlan93> g o l l y
[2:44:46] <%doomunderthestairs> not sure if they ever mentioned it
[2:44:49] <%GabeSweetMan> Did they nerf the angels?
[2:44:50] <%nip_nips> yeah this run was a nightmare before
[2:44:59] <%BoxNavy> how scary would it be if you were the last person on earth and a big scary angel was raining down beams of light at you like this
[2:45:02] <%Ziegsy> Launch angels sounds like an anime with girls in mechas and I need it
[2:45:06] <%MoonObscure> i remember how fun this angels were when this dlc got first release lol...
[2:45:11] <%doomunderthestairs> not like you can really be that stealthy with em here just gotta run for it kinda mostly
