[0:30:09] <PhantonBat> Wait a minute, there's no mustard
[0:30:11] <%spongeofmystery> Woo Kate mains represent
[0:30:32] <%king_wragles> @PeachSaliva zombies react to sound alerts btw, like slamming shed doors or blowing up gens, etc
[0:30:43] <%spongeofmystery> It's called Self-Awareness now, iirc
[0:30:54] <MarylandJutsu> slap that Orb
[0:31:07] <%cade_calrayn> you love slapping that orb?
[0:31:12] <+tempestzephyr> slap that ass like a drum
[0:31:13] <MarylandJutsu> That new girl seems cool
[0:31:15] <MarylandJutsu> witchy lady
[0:31:19] <%Ranryu692> you like Kate's ass
[0:31:32] <MarylandJutsu> @Ranryu692 paige is a woman of simple pleasures
[0:31:33] <MarylandJutsu> like mustard
[0:31:38] <%king_wragles> Kate and Meg are good, wish someone told me that Feng is super loud when she's not hurt and walking
[0:31:47] <%SaiyanShoto> @NoHoldsBarredProductions Thanks for the gift sub!
[0:31:47] <%spongeofmystery> @MarylandJutsu her hat makes her basically invisible when crouching in bushes, especially in the Western level
[0:31:49] <%superc37> what ass lmao
[0:32:03] <%superc37> theyre all flatter than a board
[0:32:05] <niffinbox> I want that sweater shes wearing
[0:32:05] <MarylandJutsu> @spongeofmystery good for her
[0:32:10] <%NoHoldsBarredProductions> @saiyanshoto You're welcome!
[0:32:21] <MarylandJutsu> I hate it when pants nerf my ass
[0:32:27] <%king_wragles> I mean if you're playing for ass, play Jane
[0:32:37] <%cade_calrayn> that's one of the many reasons I never wear pants, Maryland
[0:32:43] <%superc37> i'd kill for cheryls sweater imo
[0:32:44] <%cartakus> Romero stole all the ass
[0:32:49] <%spongeofmystery> ngl I would love a version of Cheryl's Xmas jumper
[0:32:53] <MarylandJutsu> @cade_calrayn you have learned one of the secrets of the universe
[0:33:12] <%king_wragles> @cartakus When they were handing out ass, Jane Romero went back for thirds
[0:33:13] <MarylandJutsu> Noted massive pussy PeachSaliva
[0:33:33] <%king_wragles> Did they ever un-nerfk PH's ass?
[0:33:45] <+ClericOfSparda> Paige is a pussy...Hound?
[0:33:58] <+PenmanLupine> its par the course for any MMO update
[0:33:59] <+geekjacob> yep i keep getting thrown out
[0:34:01] <%cartakus> Yeah like a couple hundred people
[0:34:05] <MarylandJutsu> Its cause the VTubers and WoWers brought their fanbases
[0:34:05] <%spongeofmystery> @king_wragles as a PH main, regrettably no sipsipElmo
[0:34:15] <GhostLizard277> yeah they un-nerfed ph's ass
[0:34:15] <TurtlesAndTentacles> More like No Walker lol
[0:34:17] <hearingthenseeing> "BART!"
[0:34:17] <%Ranryu692> if you can't get into Endwalker, download DBD free off the Epic Game Store and play it until the servers are unfucked
[0:34:20] <%Mrbaconator> pyramid head should change to pyramid ass
[0:34:21] <TimetodiveLTX> god bless them for that
[0:34:27] <TimetodiveLTX> oh fuck
[0:34:30] <%DashXero> Spotted.
[0:34:42] <%cartakus> Blegh
[0:34:44] <studleydoorite> you've got blue on you
[0:34:54] <MarylandJutsu> Nemesis's power turning people into toast
[0:35:23] <VritraReiRei> da ba de da ba di
[0:35:24] <%king_wragles> abu dee abu die
[0:35:31] <%DashXero> Oh. Hey. It's Nemesis.
[0:35:33] <+KingpinLarry> I took 2 months off FF14 near the end of Stormblood's post game. I just said "f it", and I'm going to wait a week or 2 for the "pros" to beat the story.
[0:35:38] <%superc37> paige theres a giant blue aura around your screen anytime youre within range
[0:35:47] <niffinbox> sweater ruined </3
[0:36:01] <MarylandJutsu> well we're assholes here, but we aren't elitist
[0:36:13] <%superc37> i mean theres a reason why unbreakables one of the strongest perks in the game lol
[0:36:24] <azure_dunes> nemasus
[0:36:25] <%king_wragles> Berries are for people who escape!
[0:36:32] <%superc37> yes
[0:36:42] <%superc37> it goves you an extra hit
[0:36:47] <%cartakus> Both
[0:36:52] <Zeif00> The Unbreakable boon only seems good if you're have a full swf
[0:37:13] <GhostLizard277> it's an extra health state, so it's worth it unless you want to save it for later/other players
[0:37:22] <%cartakus> Mot helping
[0:37:22] <%king_wragles> Eruption
[0:37:27] <%superc37> nemesis's perk
[0:37:32] <%cartakus> Jolt
[0:37:41] <%king_wragles> You're unable to do actions when Eruption goes off
[0:37:52] <%superc37> @cartakus nope, its eruption
[0:38:00] <%cartakus> Ya
[0:38:58] <%king_wragles> Did they change how Eruption works? I didn't see him re-apply it
[0:39:05] <heartlesshealer> just immediately, okay
[0:39:30] <$Puhff> y'all are so weird
[0:40:24] <+ClericOfSparda> You walking makes me more paranoid than running
[0:40:48] <niffinbox> wonder what pat would look like as a v tuber

[0:43:52] <BigFingerRo> promo code wooliem to cheat but NOT gamble
[0:43:53] <Dementedpenguin> @king_wragles yup, I did that yesterday
[0:43:53] <MarylandJutsu> the burnout is real for them
[0:44:09] <$alex_streams_a_thing> My friend is a nurse who is an anti-vaxxer.  It hurts to think being around her.
[0:44:16] <%Sotetsu> I love that song. :D
[0:44:17] <%spongeofmystery> @king_wragles can confirm, DECIPHERSTRIKE gets 150k
[0:44:19] <%Mrbaconator> the sky is blue and all the trees are green @PeachSaliva
[0:44:33] <%Mrbaconator> something something baked patata
[0:44:34] <MarylandJutsu> its a oofa....and dare i say a dooofa
[0:44:46] <%Spadoinkle> Oh it's rough with these firefighters. Already had some quitters.
[0:44:46] <%JoshManVGH> A dissappinting amount
[0:44:50] <%Mrbaconator> my heart is full like a baked patata?
[0:44:55] <%cartakus> lmao said the nurse lol
[0:44:56] <$alex_streams_a_thing> She LITERALLY was vaccinating people
[0:44:56] <%Spadoinkle> More overtime for me.....yay.
[0:44:59] <+buttdirt> some dopes protesting in front of a vaccination site in Montreal
[0:45:05] <+buttdirt> protested*
[0:45:06] <+SnorlaxBud> Ontario too, my local hospital pretty much fully re-staffed
[0:45:14] <marvel877> assistant to the regional scientist
[0:45:20] <%justicecadet> every job has dumb ppl
[0:45:52] <sleepystardewfarmer> my mom is a nurse and she knew a doctor who was antivax... got tons of people sick :(
[0:46:01] <%cartakus> oof
[0:46:05] <%Spadoinkle> 24 hour shifts, baby. Living that addi life.
[0:46:20] <MarylandJutsu> shit be wack
[0:46:39] <heartlesshealer> but also the damn nurse cliques
[0:46:39] <MarylandJutsu> Nah that makes sense, a lot of kids want to be a vet too
[0:46:43] <%Scarnehu> Scarnehu subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 5 months! 5 months woothank you for all the    C O N T E N T
[0:46:45] <%justicecadet> nursing fields attracts weird bullies, evangelicals
[0:47:04] <%Spadoinkle> Oh, well. Kid will get a very good Krimbus. Gotta get those Etsy Deltarune plushys somehow.
[0:47:08] <spacebowie749> oh crud, just jumped in and heard Elis voice
[0:47:11] <+Gogogolem> I remember seeing my mom covered in vomit and blood. She said nothing took a shower then sat down next to me and said don't be a nurse.
[0:47:13] <heartlesshealer> it's because they're given a position to hold power over the sick and helpless
[0:47:23] <+tempestzephyr> some of the meanest mean girls become nurses
[0:47:27] <%cartakus> Kinda makes sense, the church used to take care of the sick
[0:47:31] <SinnerEbru> travel nursing is the SHIT. only downside is it requires like 5y experience
[0:48:11] <TimetodiveLTX> to be fair they're totally bluffing
[0:48:14] <MarylandJutsu> Its the lupus
[0:48:17] <+wizard_of_diamonds> It's bad because at that point you might hope to have a life and maybe a family, which is hard as hell if you want to go into travel
[0:48:20] <TimetodiveLTX> like assholes who can't communicate properly
[0:48:23] <Treasure_Vault> This programming language was invented this year, what do you mean ten years experience
[0:48:26] <+Seancicle> au revoir
[0:48:35] <NeonBleu> "10 years experinece" but this coding language is 1 year old...
[0:48:36] <TimetodiveLTX> when they ask for a wild amount of experience
[0:48:37] <%king_wragles> I remember hearing something about nurse shortages dropping the minimum requirements for being a nurse in a few states
[0:48:37] <critiquequartz> My favorite is when they need 10+ years experience in a coding language that‚Äôs like 4 years old
[0:48:50] <+Faustgesicht> oh man an oni
[0:48:53] <StebTheVee> The meanest people become either doctors, police, or lawyers.
[0:48:54] <+Arek_1> Amanda's not a real name.
[0:48:57] <MarylandJutsu> Oni said I HEARD YOU TALKING about your past
[0:48:58] <BigFingerRo> Some motherfuckers here were looking for someone with 3 years experience in Ruby, a programming language that already isn't in use
[0:49:04] <TimetodiveLTX> just apply anyway
[0:49:10] <$alex_streams_a_thing> Amanda is a myth
[0:49:12] <%justicecadet> I feel bad for the great nurses being stuck with mean girl nurses
[0:49:21] <ignorum> amandas everywhere getting thanos snapped right now
[0:49:31] <SinnerEbru> @wizard_of_diamonds yeah the distance is a bit of a killer, housing is provided but it can fuck up family relationships at a point
[0:49:37] <heartlesshealer> but it's not ABOUT YOU, nurse in the past
[0:49:46] <MarylandJutsu> Paige: i am in IMMENSE PAIN, bad nurse: how dare you
[0:49:57] <StebTheVee> How do you get experience for a job you never had?
[0:49:57] <+wizard_of_diamonds> @SinnerEbru Especially since the juiciest contracts are for a WHILE, you're as gone as an off shore oil person
[0:50:00] <TimetodiveLTX> woof
[0:50:00] <BigFingerRo> hey Peaches, where orb?
[0:50:01] <niffinbox> curse harder
[0:50:13] <heartlesshealer> she was good, but her manner sucked
[0:50:15] <%Spadoinkle> Yeah, interviewed for IT entry job to get off the ambulance. For real, they were like, "You sure you got the work ethic for this field?" It bois are weird.
[0:50:15] <TheMostJill> Swear more.
[0:50:17] <MarylandJutsu> ah my bad, her bedside manner was....not great
[0:50:28] <MarylandJutsu> taking his 2nd shower probably
[0:50:33] <eyeobject> orb in endwalker que
[0:50:34] <%cartakus> Cursing  AT the nurse should be a problem right?
[0:50:37] <+ClericOfSparda> So was the Oni technically camping, or is this map just too tiny
[0:50:38] <%nip_nips> pat is off getting disconnected while afk from ffxiv
[0:50:48] <+BoboDaHobo> People that get upset at swearing are the dumbest people on earth
[0:50:55] <heartlesshealer> AT the nurse is a problem, just around the nurse is different
[0:51:00] <SinnerEbru> @wizard_of_diamonds yuuuup. im glad my mom took 6mo contracts at longest and was always in reasonable distance (12hr) so it wasnt The Worst
[0:51:04] <+realm_forge> I had a nurse who was visibly terrified of me and had been sent in to take my blood
[0:51:10] <%Spadoinkle> S'okay. I curse at nurses. Like all the time.
[0:51:29] <+realm_forge> It like she was locked in a room with a hungry mountain lion
[0:51:34] <$kawajenarts> ngl as someone with a fear of needles if I had a nurse who was terrible at it I'd flip my lid
[0:51:48] <%JoshManVGH> Only if they poke for an IV and like stir the needle, then I swear
[0:51:54] <%king_wragles> That was a good plan until it wasn't
[0:51:56] <+ClericOfSparda> This map is too small
[0:52:09] <SinnerEbru> lately at clinics i talk with whoevers taking my vitals about how the clinic needs more RNs
[0:52:13] <%king_wragles> This NEVER would have happened in your Meg sweater
[0:52:48] <%Spadoinkle> psaBig focus. psaBig concentrate.
[0:52:51] <%Sotetsu> This map is frustrating as killer when they bring boons, because they can reach through both floors.
[0:52:56] <%aishman> aishman subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 25 months! 25 months of the best vtuber! Also Paige, any chances of you, Pat and Ellie ever playing a digital board game on stream?
[0:53:03] <QueequegTheater> I don't know, as a killer I love this map Kappa
[0:53:04] <%Sotetsu> Emphasis on sick
[0:53:08] <+KingpinLarry> did you say sick or sex skills?
[0:53:13] <%nip_nips> yes
[0:53:14] <%Ranryu692> they're a kind of sick
[0:53:18] <+ClericOfSparda> I've only ever seen Oni here and in the Corn farm
[0:53:24] <+KingpinLarry> I wasn't paying attention
[0:53:24] <spacebowie749> I came to your stream because your skill is making me laugh, which is pretty sick in my opinion
[0:53:42] <%king_wragles> Do you skills have appendicitis? Cause they're pretty sick
[0:53:47] <%king_wragles> Thank you, I'll be here all week
[0:53:52] <LeviMonstaPaws> How did you dodge that??
[0:54:00] <pokefan9956> @peachsaliva , did you get the Ethernet hooked up yet?
[0:54:11] <$FrostedZaibatsu> DBD is free on the Epic store too
[0:54:15] <%Sotetsu> When I play killer, I like to think my opponents are like Paige. Makes me feel nicer towards them.
[0:54:34] <+mostdumbname> that's a sick Oni skin
[0:55:02] <leinadtonu> Hi Paige, Eli, and chat. I got the epic store free version of this game. Is there any DLC you'd recommend? Sorry if this has already been asked.
[0:55:06] <%Sotetsu> Sweet, and actually enjoying the game
[0:55:06] <mattymcfilth> you got killed by oni-chan
[0:55:36] <@SoFarFetched> yeah she's gone up against artist
[0:55:37] <%polothegreatest> LUL
[0:55:39] <%cartakus> Pov you have a Ethernet cable but no fighting games to play. How long until Project L god?
[0:55:40] <otakon17> the Stranger Things DLC you should buy
[0:55:46] <MarylandJutsu> @otakon17 ........
[0:55:50] <otakon17> if they're still available because,
[0:55:53] <@SoFarFetched> you can't buy the stranger things DLC anymore
[0:56:00] <@SoFarFetched> it's been gone since last month
[0:56:04] <otakon17> well shoot
[0:56:14] <MarylandJutsu> Although some DLC is one killer or one survivor
[0:56:14] <$alex_streams_a_thing> The epic store irritated me so much I uninstalled that damn thing.
[0:56:14] <mor3gan> DBD isn't free? Doesn't all the dlc cost like as much as a game
[0:56:16] <%cartakus> Demodoggo is a rare animal now
[0:56:24] <%Sotetsu> Find a killer that looks cool, and buy that. it goes on sale a lot.
[0:56:25] <@SoFarFetched> DbD is free on epic game stores soon
[0:56:27] <+mostdumbname> I would just go off which killer or suvivor you think is neat. There's a big meta to the game I wouldn't worry too much if you're just starting out
[0:56:34] <MarylandJutsu> @mor3gan base game has a good chunk of survivors and killers
[0:56:37] <Zeif00> I think Otz has a video about what dlcs to buy first
[0:56:40] <@SoFarFetched> but dlc you need to buy
[0:56:45] <Lildiablos> Just got back from bootcamp when did Paige become a Vtuber
[0:56:54] <otakon17> a wee back
[0:56:56] <%Sotetsu> @sofarfetched It's free now until the 7th
[0:56:56] <MarylandJutsu> @Lildiablos oh quite a whlie ago my dude
[0:56:56] <%Spadoinkle> Going on my dating profile: "Ugh, I like more evasive skills..."
[0:57:04] <goatbrice> hello, what perks are you using?
[0:57:13] <%polothegreatest> demongorgon is a shiny killer now HolidayCookie
[0:57:16] <KageAruki> for killers, most recommend Leatherface (his perk that other killers then get is very useful for leveling up)
[0:57:17] <%king_wragles> Start out with any killer except Huntress, or you'll be fucked for killer forever. Signed a Huntress main
[0:57:35] <@SoFarFetched> yeah you debuted late July I believe
[0:57:35] <%cartakus> Nurse is up there too
[0:57:50] <+mostdumbname> Paige's boobas are in the way of seeing her perks
[0:57:51] <otakon17> vtuber model is covering the perks
[0:57:54] <MarylandJutsu> yeah it was summery i think with the debut
[0:57:56] <+mostdumbname> a crying shame
[0:58:01] <%king_wragles> I'd love to be able to play a killer that isn't Huntress
[0:58:15] <$Niney_Who> Start out with Killer, Buy Demogorgon-- oh right
[0:58:19] <@SoFarFetched> but then we can't see vtuber
[0:58:21] <otakon17> can't you heal?
[0:58:22] <+purgamentoram> Paige have you ever tried the perk smash hit? I feel like you might enjoy it
[0:58:30] <MarylandJutsu> @SoFarFetched truly a catch 22
[0:58:36] <mor3gan> doesn't every player hate every killer
[0:58:40] <%Sotetsu> My first killer was Legion. They are good for learning basic chases. I still love them. PrideFloat
[0:58:46] <otakon17> so screwed either way
[0:58:52] <%king_wragles> This map is really in Oni's favor here. Few good windows
[0:58:52] <@SoFarFetched> it's the DbD way
[0:59:00] <%cartakus> The only way
[0:59:04] <+mostdumbname> Everyone has one or two they don't like going against the most
[0:59:06] <MarylandJutsu> depending on the killer and their buffs
[0:59:09] <+ClericOfSparda> I'm fine with most killers, but I particularly hate Oni
[0:59:10] <$Niney_Who> you can say Blight paige it's ok
[0:59:14] <MarylandJutsu> some get buffed, others get nerfed
[0:59:16] <otakon17> Billy?
[0:59:22] <KageAruki> Hillbilly
[0:59:26] <otakon17> oh Hillybilly
[0:59:30] <$Niney_Who> Yeah playing him is the same
[0:59:38] <$Puhff> billy no
[0:59:38] <%cartakus> Vommy mommy
[0:59:43] <%king_wragles> HEY, remember when Blight was just a joke and then people finally figured out how to play him?
[0:59:44] <MarylandJutsu> Bing Bong Boy
[0:59:44] <Latija> bing bong?
[0:59:44] <$Puhff> billy y
[0:59:47] <KageAruki> Everyone hates playing against Spirit (a bit better now, but infamous for making people disconnect to avoid playing the match)
[0:59:48] <%king_wragles> Now he's a fucking MENACE
[0:59:48] <%Ranryu692> go Knicks
[0:59:52] <otakon17> wait do they even need the Hillbilly now since they have Leatherface?
[0:59:54] <MarylandJutsu> Wraith scary now
[0:59:57] <$Niney_Who> because to be Freakishly good with Blight you gotta have a high-sensitivity and know how to meld into certain objects to dash along them
[0:59:58] <pokefan9956> go mets
[1:00:00] <BigFingerRo> BI LI
[1:00:02] <MarylandJutsu> @otakon17 they're slightly different
[1:00:09] <BigFingerRo> I NEED YOUR HELP BIG BAD BI LI
[1:00:10] <pokefan9956> love da mets
[1:00:12] <%king_wragles> @pokefan9956 IT'S ALL ABOUT THE METS BABY
[1:00:14] <+ClericOfSparda> I like Vommy Mommy
[1:00:17] <@SoFarFetched> yeah hillbilly and leatherface play different
[1:00:19] <otakon17> Bubba's? XD
[1:00:28] <@SoFarFetched> bubba is leatherface
[1:00:28] <%Sotetsu> What does being a Legion main say about me? fmgJAHN
[1:00:30] <Jakeawienas> I've always called wraith "the bell tolls' when i play with friends
[1:00:34] <%generalve> Paige's avatar looks so weird when she eats
[1:00:35] <otakon17> ah
[1:00:39] <trobort> Hubba Bubba
[1:00:41] <+purgamentoram> Bubba is a simple man
[1:00:43] <sekshun789> The only killer I actively hate playing against is ghost face because my A.D.D genuinely won‚Äôt let me focus enough on the screen so I always get insta downed lol. Stealth killers are the bane of my existence
[1:00:46] <otakon17> wow I had no idea DbD had this much meta to it
[1:00:46] <@SoFarFetched> people like basement camping as bubba
[1:00:48] <+Faustgesicht> Now how bout vommy mommy?
[1:00:51] <%king_wragles> Bubba mains don't return the shopping cart to the coral
[1:00:51] <+kiradusk4200> whats Grapes take on Demo-Dog players?
[1:00:53] <MarylandJutsu> Doctor used to be a problem
[1:00:53] <%cartakus> Or nurse aka Fucking over powered meta closing queen bitch
[1:00:54] <Zeif00> Only thing you can really do against camping is to just do the gens and get out
[1:00:55] <$Niney_Who> The only killer who seems to always tunnel me is Nemmy
[1:01:01] <%king_wragles> Bubba mains pick fruit from the bottom
[1:01:02] <eyeobject> But which killers kiss each other?
[1:01:07] <MarylandJutsu> @eyeobject none
[1:01:10] <Hypnotoad0823> does Paiges avatar have tiddie physics?
[1:01:11] <$Niney_Who> I am one uhnSuffer
[1:01:19] <%king_wragles> Bubba mains put the toilet paper under, not over
[1:01:21] <$Niney_Who> Demogorgon kisses Artist
[1:01:23] <@SoFarFetched> yeah it got titty physics
[1:01:24] <%justicecadet> DBD ships hell yeah
[1:01:29] <$Sphincter_Spelunker> atpCap
[1:01:31] <%kyh9> I main Demo.  It's fun
[1:01:31] <%justicecadet> I think it's fanon
[1:01:32] <CrimsonFox777> ?
[1:01:32] <+mostdumbname> I remember haging out with people who would accuse everyone of blowing a ghost everytime they yawned
[1:01:35] <$Niney_Who> They had matching outfits
[1:01:37] <+mostdumbname> It was funny every time
[1:01:42] <TallYoda08> atpCap atpCap atpCap
[1:01:42] <+ClericOfSparda> LUL
[1:01:49] <%justicecadet> killer x survivor
[1:01:50] <MarylandJutsu> That explains a lot about PAige
[1:01:50] <%cartakus> Nurse blight and hag is the Trinity of Hell
[1:01:52] <%kyh9> Maining Demogorgon means you go through Red add-ons like crazy, especially the ones that let you silently emerge and shit
[1:01:54] <%Spadoinkle> E-lies.
[1:01:54] <%king_wragles> None of the killers know each other @PeachSaliva
[1:01:55] <otakon17> says the woman lusting after a 7 foot tall skeleton
[1:01:55] <pokefan9956> this feels like one of the weirdest games to have shipping
[1:02:01] <+ClericOfSparda> LUL Paige is fandom trash t101EHHH
[1:02:03] <%cooldude69xx> This... true lie
[1:02:03] <$Puhff> I don't think the ghosts and monsters care much for romance
[1:02:04] <$Niney_Who> HAg is the worst to play against. Nurse depends.
[1:02:11] <Tracazoid> More than Odo?
[1:02:11] <placeholder03> Pyramid Head and Nemisis are boyfriends
[1:02:11] <@SoFarFetched> well you got legion being 4 different people
[1:02:12] <%justicecadet> @pokefan9956 nah, it's spicy
[1:02:12] <MarylandJutsu> Paige: isn't it cannon that i'm marrying pat for his skeleton
[1:02:14] <%kyh9> Nothing is more fun than just appearing from around a corner with no warning
[1:02:15] <otakon17> DID YOU SEE THE QUARK NFT THING PAIGE!?
[1:02:18] <MarylandJutsu> @SoFarFetched oh god don't remind me
[1:02:35] <+purgamentoram> I feel like Ghostface and Nemesis would get it on
[1:02:35] <+realm_forge> HOW COUD YOU BETRAY ODO?
[1:02:37] <+ClericOfSparda> Paige retweeted the Quark NFT thing and I could not stop watching it
[1:02:44] <otakon17> lol it's great
[1:02:45] <$Sphincter_Spelunker> NTR Odo
[1:02:48] <+purgamentoram> Paige tell us about your dbd doujins
[1:02:52] <MarylandJutsu> I like Data
[1:02:53] <otakon17> "They stole my apes Odo!"
[1:03:01] <otakon17> Quark needs someone to work off of
[1:03:23] <%king_wragles> I feel like Garrick is so mysterious and interesting as a character is because we're forced to fill in the blanks for his character
[1:03:25] <$Sphincter_Spelunker> atpCap
[1:03:28] <%cartakus> aww cool
[1:03:31] <+ClericOfSparda> LUL LUL LUL
[1:03:34] <$Niney_Who> One thing is always certain in DBD. Bunny Fengs have like an 80% chance to be Assholes.
[1:03:37] <MarylandJutsu> Paige was lost in the doujinshi

[1:07:27] <+blue_eyed_tyrant> gotta crouch spam with the ghostface
[1:07:34] <@SoFarFetched> ghostface just peeks at you long enough to get you exposed
[1:07:40] <otakon17> @FrostedZaibatsu almost positive no
[1:07:45] <%king_wragles> "while I'm bleeding out on this hook, I'll just read donos real quick"
[1:07:54] <otakon17> I wish there was a digital version of Heroquest
[1:07:57] <MarylandJutsu> @SoFarFetched ghostface gives me low key anxiety
[1:08:09] <+pectusumbra> Play Armello. It's very pretty and Plague can make inappropriate fan art
[1:08:11] <@SoFarFetched> ghostface I can't take serious because he dances

[1:25:40] <%rdark_ksu> How you feel about twice baked potatoes???
[1:25:40] <Cynical2DD> Thats not good, Kenny had his heart replaced with a bake potato and he died
[1:25:49] <$StephanieSadGirl> You mean there was a point where Plague and Pat were orb brothers?
[1:26:02] <morcego_cinzento_arts> i liked mashed potatos if they are not too much l√≠quido like and with some seasoning and spices.
[1:26:08] <%THATGUY_789> more the load than the potat
[1:26:09] <niffinbox> he became the potato

[1:28:21] <morcego_cinzento_arts> my fave way to do potatos is to peal their skin, dice them into small cubes, boil them in a pressure pot for about 15 mins, then i either bake then in the over or fry then. they get crispy outside and mushy inside

[1:37:34] <$StephanieSadGirl> Paige... not every black person is Tapp...  Is this like the Dark Pictures game again?
[1:37:37] <morcego_cinzento_arts> plot twist is that Eli is not a person, but rather the voice of reason inside Paige's head desperately trying to get her to survive
[1:37:41] <inorwise> n-no hes a teacher

[1:40:40] <pokefan9956> somebody could mod the game to make him look like pat
[1:40:41] <%JoshManVGH> Would it be prop hunt with Chucky?
[1:40:43] <morcego_cinzento_arts> @stephaniesadgirl indeed
[1:40:47] <$StephanieSadGirl> How did she miss that swing?
[1:40:48] <TimetodiveLTX> chucky never seemed like a monster that'd chase you in the woods
[1:41:00] <%JoshManVGH> Bunch of good guy dolls all over the map and Chucky hides among them
[1:41:21] <$StephanieSadGirl> @JoshManVGH So chucky would be reverse prop hunt?
[1:41:21] <Mamba_janai> chucky would make it hard for the survivor to see
[1:41:26] <morcego_cinzento_arts> Paige says Chucky, but i think of the living toys in the puppet Master movies
[1:41:29] <%LanceCorpralScottBukake> @peachsaliva you won‚Äôt get Chucky. You‚Äôll get Annebelle and you‚Äôll like it.
[1:41:34] <$Sphincter_Spelunker> wouldn't chucky be a problem like Yoda in Soul Caliber
[1:41:51] <TimetodiveLTX> yeah chucky doing flips and shti
[1:41:54] <eyeobject> Chucky and his wife on top of each other in a trench coat might work as a killer
[1:41:56] <%Sotetsu> Ouch, only one hook
[1:41:58] <%cartakus> Wait how would the fucker hook anyone?
[1:41:59] <$StephanieSadGirl> Chucky would probably have to like, jump onto a survivor and proc a skill check that they have to fail inorder to get a hit, to make the small size fair
[1:42:44] <%LanceCorpralScottBukake> No! Chuck‚Äôs gender binary child!! That‚Äôs the character!
[1:42:45] <$StephanieSadGirl> Plague, you mean that DBD has... bugs?  why I never
[1:42:48] <+DonFrancisco34> @PeachSaliva Did you see the movie based off the character The Shape from DBD?
[1:42:52] <morcego_cinzento_arts> i would love if they added some Guilhermo Del Toro monsters as killers, like the strigoi/reaver vampires, or the Judas Breed bugs in Mimic
[1:42:59] <%LanceCorpralScottBukake> Not binary. Non binary
[1:43:54] <%cartakus> I though he decided to be a boy by the end of the movie
[1:44:03] <+SpareKeese> Remember to drink water everyone!
[1:44:10] <eyeobject> Candyman would be pretty cool
[1:44:13] <$StephanieSadGirl> @SpareKeese maxmor2Teefs maxmor2Teefs maxmor2Teefs
[1:44:19] <$Sphincter_Spelunker> oh shit, you right @SpareKeese thanks
[1:44:36] <%LanceCorpralScottBukake> @eyeobject Candy man would be tight
[1:44:48] <%LanceCorpralScottBukake> @eyeobject he literally has a hook
[1:44:57] <+SpareKeese> @sphincter_spelunker Np!
[1:45:03] <%cartakus> So does hook man
[1:45:16] <$StephanieSadGirl> @PeachSaliva Thank you for streaming, catching you live, or seeing the VODs pop up on youtube make my day.
[1:45:24] <+diegobandzz> Are they still doing Star Trek streams by any chance?
[1:45:33] <morcego_cinzento_arts> i imagine each survivor in a roll of escapes if it was a story, would be like Scream's Sydney Campbell. Just over and over again she has to survive some insane slasher over and over again
[1:45:48] <%cartakus> I think one of the killers from 13 ghosts would be cool
[1:46:02] <@SoFarFetched> @diegobandzz they did one recently the other day,to find out when they do it check PlagueofGripes twitter. It tends to be planned day of or a lil before.
[1:46:11] <%spongeofmystery> Self Preservation is so incredibly marginal that it's never worth taking
[1:46:14] <+diegobandzz> Ahhh thanks
[1:46:17] <morcego_cinzento_arts> i can see a killer from 13 Ghosts
[1:46:23] <RushUnplugged> Lower Decks when
[1:46:26] <pokefan9956> I have absolutely no idea how he'd work, but they should add AM from I have no mouth and I must scream
[1:46:34] <$StephanieSadGirl> @morcego_cinzento_arts That movie scared the crap out of me as a kid
[1:46:48] <MarylandJutsu> Oh yeah Paige, my mom has a French Bulldog named Skye, she also mermaids like Gief does, I told my mom that you call it that and shes taken to using it
[1:46:48] <%cartakus> AM is overpowered
[1:46:59] <$StephanieSadGirl> Am would have to be the map itself
[1:47:14] <morcego_cinzento_arts> @stephaniesadgirl never seen it but saw the ghost designs
[1:47:20] <pokefan9956> yeah. I have no mouth and I must scream would have to, like, be its own game
[1:47:33] <%FingaLights> What about the Blob
[1:47:47] <QueequegTheater> Like every perk is just "Yeah but Spine Chill is better"
[1:47:51] <$StephanieSadGirl> @morcego_cinzento_arts My guess is that it doesn't hold up, but the designs were so good
[1:47:58] <KageAruki> small game is actually good
[1:48:32] <KageAruki> otz did a bit of anecdotal testing, and i think he decided detective's hunch was probably the most useful, then small game
[1:48:38] <MarylandJutsu> Small game is a phoenix
[1:48:39] <morcego_cinzento_arts> @stephaniesadgirl very few early 2000's horror movies do
[1:48:49] <%cartakus> I think it does still entertain atleast. The ghost that crushed shaggy was so simple but he terrified me as a kid
[1:48:49] <$StephanieSadGirl> I loved running an asshole build, that was built around babysitter and POing the killer off, get myself killed so often
[1:48:53] <$Sphincter_Spelunker> what was the movie that made Sandra Bullock laugh at the monster so they nix'd showing it in the final cut
[1:48:56] <KageAruki> no, for the totem hunting perks
[1:49:05] <KageAruki> counterforce was one of the worst if i recall
[1:49:13] <%cartakus> Bird box
[1:49:25] <%spongeofmystery> I run Detective's Hunch as often as I can because I still don't know where everything spawns yet
[1:49:36] <$Sphincter_Spelunker> @cartakus that's it, thanks
[1:49:41] <$StephanieSadGirl> Sabo is useless now, completly useless
[1:49:47] <WoolieVersus> 168 raiders from WoolieVersus have joined! 
[1:49:58] <pokefan9956> RAID
[1:49:58] <%polothegreatest> woolieYE woolieYE woolieYE woolieYE
[1:49:58] <+SnorlaxBud> Birthday Trash Raid

[1:49:59] <CrimsonFox777> Didn't the hooks not come back after being sabotaged way back when?

[1:49:59] <@SoFarFetched> Thanks for the raid woolie! geefSmush
[1:50:01] <Dementedpenguin> When the game first came out, hooks never regenerated. Killers had to drag survivors to the basement.
[1:50:03] <$StephanieSadGirl> Even trying to sabo as htey are hooking doesnt matter if the killer just drops the survivor and waits
[1:50:08] <Dementedpenguin> *when sabo'd
[1:50:14] <+SpareKeese> Woolie! Hello!
[1:50:16] <%king_wragles> Delaying the killer is the most effective thing a survivor can do other than just focusing down gens

[1:51:35] <%baka_sugoi> REGGIE SOULS
[1:51:43] <%FingaLights> How is Pat enjoying his crack?
[1:51:49] <%cartakus> Reggie is busted
[1:51:50] <$Sphincter_Spelunker> fucking Archers
[1:51:55] <slackerunchained> Reggie is alternately lucky and on the very verge of Hollowing out.
[1:51:56] <$Sphincter_Spelunker> that was bullshit
[1:52:03] <%baka_sugoi> Reggies Tarkus moment was funny
[1:52:06] <%DashXero> There's some skill in how that luck is used.
[1:52:15] <+emperordread> #TeamReggie woolieKICKDAD
[1:52:16] <%Dakuu75> @PeachSaliva are you having fun?
[1:52:16] <%Ranryu692> @peachsaliva you should talk to Woolie about you invading Reggie
[1:52:22] <%doomunderthestairs> same
[1:52:25] <someyounguy1> everyone deserves a tarkus moment
[1:52:27] <plaguedoctor_vi> Not all those who wonder are lost
[1:52:28] <+Ragnakawaii> Black Iron Farkus
[1:52:28] <RushUnplugged> Reggie got Tarkus-gaslit
[1:52:32] <Teras_ode> Two Tarkus moments to be exact LUL
[1:52:44] <QueequegTheater> Is he not looking at bricks long enough for Eli Kappa
[1:52:49] <MarylandJutsu> Uncle Eli only likes them youtube
[1:52:58] <%doomunderthestairs> Reggie hunters
[1:53:04] <%baka_sugoi> who would win Reggie or Paige in a SOULS match?
[1:53:17] <MarylandJutsu> I feel you paige, adderall does that to me too
[1:53:25] <lloyddboy> Reggie-ciders
[1:53:25] <+SpareKeese> Huh
[1:53:26] <Samex_Comex> A cooling fan?
[1:53:31] <Teras_ode> They also have that Watchdog thing on so I don't know if it blocks invaders too
[1:53:41] <%weapon000> So Eli is hot-headed?
[1:53:44] <$Sphincter_Spelunker> Paige would fall off a cliff
[1:53:45] <QueequegTheater> The Reggie queue is clogged LUL
[1:53:45] <%AncelDeLambert> Reggie switched on the patience switch
[1:53:49] <%doomunderthestairs> yeeeeep
[1:53:56] <$Sphincter_Spelunker> unga
[1:53:59] <%AncelDeLambert> she does not MASH, she RUBS her face on in
[1:53:59] <Profmcstevie> you'd make him laugh yelling about balls IN your ass
[1:53:59] <Teras_ode> depends if paige has UGS or not
[1:53:59] <RushUnplugged> the first to backroll off a cliff loses
[1:54:01] <MarylandJutsu> Paige you LOVE mashing DONT LIE
[1:54:03] <%doomunderthestairs> unga bunga
[1:54:04] <%cobalt_phoenix_> big unga
[1:54:04] <rosemon5001> paige spread her debuff over the interwebs to farmer man
[1:54:05] <%cartakus> You ARE good at bloodborne
[1:54:06] <%baka_sugoi> the last time you played you just UNGA BUNGA
[1:54:08] <VritraReiRei> "I don't mash r1" Kappa
[1:54:09] <%polothegreatest> BIG numbers
[1:54:16] <eyeobject> Paige's lack of planning would work in her favor
[1:54:18] <%Ranryu692> Paige vs Reggie would be the battle of underthinking against overthinking
[1:54:23] <%AncelDeLambert> the strategy is "YAAAAAAAH!"
[1:54:27] <%cobalt_phoenix_> reggie would win because of his luck
[1:54:28] <+mostdumbname> paige rolls her face and boobs all over the controller
[1:54:29] <%doomunderthestairs> hmmmmm so smash
[1:54:30] <slackerunchained> That means you win against the Four Kings, Paige. :P
[1:54:31] <%DashXero> Cobra Kai
[1:54:32] <$StephanieSadGirl> I dont mash, Paige says, and im just remembering the Detarune mecha fight...
[1:54:35] <TimetodiveLTX> reggie has probably played whatever game you're talking about at a high level
[1:54:39] <%cartakus> The BEST souls like
[1:54:41] <Tracazoid> Panicked flailing
[1:54:43] <%baka_sugoi> Reggie has luck You have UNGA
[1:54:44] <studleydoorite> is Plauge some sort of bad man apologist!?
[1:54:56] <eyeobject> hit bad man because he mean me
[1:55:00] <TimetodiveLTX> reggie probably knows all the top players on a first name basis randomly
[1:55:04] <Cynical2DD> Using the scyhte in DS3 I gotta smash since it kills in 3-4 swings
[1:55:05] <vehementvadr> Paige's sigma grindset is the r1 button
[1:55:07] <slackerunchained> Appo!
[1:55:14] <%AncelDeLambert> nom nom nom nom
[1:55:19] <KageAruki> So, I found the Otz totem video. For finding the first totem: Map > Small game > detectives > counterforce
[1:55:25] <%polothegreatest> WutFace
[1:55:26] <Samex_Comex> He looks like a pig
[1:55:27] <essence_of_lariatto> Golly
[1:55:27] <@SoFarFetched> For someone who doesn't like Mashed potatoes you sure like MASHING buttons  geefPlz
[1:55:29] <slackerunchained> Jeez. how long does this game take to load?
[1:55:30] <%Dakuu75> I just finished cooking dinner and the WHOLE time I was thinking... "I hope to got FFXIV doesn't log me out" lol
[1:55:33] <+SpareKeese> I REMEMBER THAT
[1:55:38] <@SoFarFetched> GOLLY
[1:55:40] <%AncelDeLambert> wait, Paige doesn't like mash potatos?
[1:55:43] <Profmcstevie> OH THAT
[1:55:44] <%AncelDeLambert> Paige.
[1:55:48] <%cartakus> Oh yeah the dead rising psychos they could be in dbd too I guess
[1:55:53] <@SoFarFetched> It was a pig looking creature eli
[1:55:54] <Cynical2DD> Hes a pig clown
[1:55:55] <$Sphincter_Spelunker> you must die
[1:55:57] <+SpareKeese> It was a pig man
[1:55:58] <morcego_cinzento_arts> Reggie would win with all his Lucky drops. like how fortunate for his build to get in his first tit√¢nio demon fight, a poleiro that uses both strengh and inteligence
[1:56:01] <%polothegreatest> "GOOD" - Zelda
[1:56:12] <@SoFarFetched> @AncelDeLambert yeah she said earlier she doesnt like mashed potatoes
[1:56:17] <KageAruki> finding all totems: Map > small game, detectives, counterforce  cleansing all totems, Map > detectives, small, game, counterforce  So counterforce was consistently the worst in his limited testing

[2:00:17] <Druss_M> ROCK and STONE
[2:00:20] <rosemon5001> vhs looks like that hello neighbour multiplayer
[2:00:33] <@MelBrooksKA> But the game is always dead in the daylight
[2:00:42] <@SoFarFetched> There's also that Evil Dead Asymmetrical coming out
[2:00:45] <QueequegTheater> DBD has too many licensed killers
[2:00:48] <%cartakus> No Jason from space
[2:00:49] <CommanderCOOL> oh this game is free on epic store...is this crossplay??
[2:00:52] <graemecrackers2> TikTacToe is best gameplay
[2:00:52] <Dementedpenguin> I was bummed you never got to play as the mother.
[2:00:56] <@SoFarFetched> @CommanderCOOL yeah DbD has crossplay
[2:01:00] <%baka_sugoi> JAY SOOON
[2:01:01] <+diegobandzz> JAson
[2:01:02] <CommanderCOOL> hell yeah
[2:01:04] <slackerunchained> Jason wearing a baseball uniform... but also still wearing his hockey mask...
[2:01:09] <CommanderCOOL> @SoFarFetched thanks dude
[2:01:09] <QueequegTheater> You don't get to play as Michael Myers in other asym games
[2:01:09] <YakumoYomi> Friday the 13th is unfortunately a "dead" game because of rights disputes (unless that's changed)
[2:01:16] <slackerunchained> Don't go, Jason Waterfalls...
[2:01:30] <waltzqueen> @slackerunchained LUL
[2:01:48] <@SoFarFetched> yeah isn't it you have multiple ways to escape for Friday the 13th? sofarfThink
[2:01:53] <morcego_cinzento_arts> "oh but he's back! he's the man behind the mask!"
[2:01:53] <MrGreenToS> Friday the 13th game with mic and friends is pretty good
[2:01:59] <$StephanieSadGirl> Eli has very good taste
[2:02:00] <%cartakus> I don't like most movie killers tbh, also Trickster
[2:02:01] <lloyddboy> big an strong
[2:02:04] <%justicecadet> michael?
[2:02:04] <@SoFarFetched> Press X to Jason
[2:02:11] <Profmcstevie> It has to be Huntress with Pyramid Heads CHEEKS being nerfed....
[2:02:20] <$Sphincter_Spelunker> pre-nerf Pyramid Head
[2:02:22] <waltzqueen> Trickster is all Stlye no substance, much like actual KPop stars
[2:02:30] <Dapper_Cactuar> also the game has a stamina meter
[2:02:34] <$StephanieSadGirl> Even with the cheeks, Pyramid head doesnt slay people like Huntress slays sapphics
[2:02:43] <VritraReiRei> Paige's ears keep twitching a lot and its SUPER cute LUL
[2:02:53] <%AncelDeLambert> yeah, the game is pretty much dead
[2:02:59] <+diegobandzz> @slackerunchained boo to you sir
[2:03:02] <Lixagon> the game go caught in a copyright nightmare and they had to drop development
[2:03:03] <+mostdumbname> How's the Predator game the same company made doing? It didn't look too great from the gameplay I saw
[2:03:06] <%AncelDeLambert> I feel the same way about MOBAs
[2:03:06] <CommanderCOOL> you can play evolve....wait XD
[2:03:09] <waltzqueen> did you ever play L4D2 versus"?
[2:03:09] <@SoFarFetched> yeah I feel that
[2:03:11] <+ALazo> you should have that looked at
[2:03:13] <Oxybe> Wasn't there a predator asymmetiric game?
[2:03:17] <slackerunchained> @diegobandzz I apologize for nothing. :)
[2:03:18] <Case_Ah_Dia> the population died due to Jason killing them all
[2:03:19] <%AncelDeLambert> kinda sad that Awesomenauts is dead, now that I'm reminded
[2:03:30] <%cartakus> Yeah hunting grounds or something?
[2:03:36] <@SoFarFetched> geefSnap HE CAME geefSnap
[2:03:37] <%AncelDeLambert> DAMN I wish there was a player base for Awesomenauts
[2:03:39] <%weapon000> I came
[2:03:41] <Case_Ah_Dia> It's NFT man
[2:03:41] <MarylandJutsu> We opened the box......and HE CAME
[2:03:46] <$StephanieSadGirl> HE CAME
[2:03:51] <CrimsonFox777> Who you callin' Pinhead?
[2:03:53] <Dementedpenguin> I only played the demo for Predator. That game could end in seconds if you knew how to play the Predator LUL
[2:03:54] <morcego_cinzento_arts> predator: hunting Ground
[2:04:04] <$Sphincter_Spelunker> I'm Dirty Dan
[2:04:10] <CommanderCOOL> does this game have proximity chat?
[2:04:17] <Case_Ah_Dia> I thought it was a bug???
[2:04:19] <slackerunchained> @cartakus Did you say Haunting Ground? Aww, Yiss! I'm gonna pet the heck outta Hewie. :D
[2:04:19] <$StephanieSadGirl> no chat at all
[2:04:21] <@SoFarFetched> Yeah I think the original creator of Hellraiser is BARELY getting his IP back later this month
[2:04:26] <morcego_cinzento_arts> i want to try Alien: Fireteam Elite
[2:04:37] <%FingaLights> What's that really old game where there are three factions. like, one giant , a small group of gun guys with jetpacks and then zerg like group
[2:04:38] <Case_Ah_Dia> thank you
[2:04:38] <$StephanieSadGirl> @CommanderCOOL No there is no chat at all in game
[2:04:42] <Piemono> Isn't the original creator of Hellraiser just Clive Barker?
[2:04:43] <%baka_sugoi> Case O DillA
[2:04:45] <Mrman617> I assumed it was because of the "I CAME!" jokes
[2:04:52] <CommanderCOOL> @StephanieSadGirl whoa really??
[2:04:52] <%doomunderthestairs> LIES
[2:04:55] <CommanderCOOL> why not
[2:05:07] <$Sphincter_Spelunker> would be better if you had Dilluh instead @Case_Ah_Dia
[2:05:36] <$StephanieSadGirl> @CommanderCOOL Yeah, the survivor game play is designed around not being able to communicate, its why killers complain so much about teams of survivors using discord or some other third party software
[2:05:38] <Case_Ah_Dia> Behaviour refuses to behave
[2:05:39] <morcego_cinzento_arts> @piemono indeed He is
[2:05:59] <%cartakus> oh boy
[2:06:20] <CommanderCOOL> @StephanieSadGirl oh interesting. you would think they would account for 3rd party apps like that
[2:06:31] <graemecrackers2> he spooky
[2:06:42] <@SoFarFetched> Yeah the only chat in DbD is after chat and the chat between survivors while waiting to find a match or in lobby
[2:06:45] <%AncelDeLambert> the killer is pretty pissed right about now
[2:06:49] <@SoFarFetched> though after chat can get VERY spicy sofarfRage
[2:06:58] <CommanderCOOL> lmao
[2:07:04] <$StephanieSadGirl> @CommanderCOOL The devs seem to not care at all about third party apps and stuff
[2:07:06] <%cartakus> Chain hunt
[2:07:08] <MarylandJutsu> Brave to assume Paige knows what a box looks like PAige
[2:07:09] <CommanderCOOL> i bet. bunch a salty sams
[2:07:21] <@SoFarFetched> She can't because the box is also yellow like her perk window of opportunity LUL
[2:07:27] <eyeobject> Does Paige need her glasses?
[2:07:27] <+Damie904> It's a white object that has an aura
[2:07:27] <raineedaydreams> oh is that the guy with glitchy chains when he first came out
[2:07:29] <Oxybe> woof. i just checked predator hunting grounds on steamcharts. 60 average players
[2:07:29] <%FingaLights> "You opened the box... I came"
[2:07:31] <@SoFarFetched> so the yellow box might blend in with the yellow highlighted  things.
[2:07:39] <CommanderCOOL> @StephanieSadGirl ahh okay thank you for keeping me updated
[2:07:42] <%AncelDeLambert> there's a lot of yellow on screen right now
[2:07:44] <@SoFarFetched> and Plague said someone picked it up
[2:07:51] <morcego_cinzento_arts> you guys remember Riddick: Assault on Dark Athena? it had a multiplayer of a team of four players as mercenaries VS one player as riddick in stealth mode
[2:07:54] <slackerunchained> Imagine how ridiculously surreal a horror movie would be if it played out like a Killer-Loss match, where the slasher kills absolutely nobody and the survivors are just outright clowning on him. :P
[2:07:54] <@SoFarFetched> geefSnape HE CAME geefSnap
[2:07:57] <@SoFarFetched> geefSnap *
[2:08:01] <%AncelDeLambert> primarily from the stream of SCARE PISS oozing out behind Paige
[2:08:02] <$StephanieSadGirl> @CommanderCOOL You are welcome!
[2:08:05] <MarylandJutsu> this game is truly held together by toothpaste and toothpicks
[2:08:08] <%weapon000> she said the thing  HahaBall
[2:08:17] <Case_Ah_Dia> I hope he cleaned up afterwards
[2:08:23] <@SoFarFetched> yeah you would think they would have the box a different color then with window of opportunity.
[2:08:34] <Slimeking_Mike> The Box. You Opened It. I Glooped
[2:08:40] <CommanderCOOL> i might have to try this out. ive never played these types of games before
[2:08:43] <%cartakus> Wah? No, dbd is a complete and reliable game

[2:09:30] <$StephanieSadGirl> His terror radius is Big and Long and I came
[2:09:51] <%AncelDeLambert> His terror radius is huge and doesn't afraid of anything
[2:10:05] <morcego_cinzento_arts> gurfy terror
[2:10:25] <MarylandJutsu> popping that good generator
[2:10:34] <morcego_cinzento_arts> terror ripped for her pleasure

[2:17:42] <Tracazoid> The 4000 queue wait isn't so much the issue, it's the crashing out of it consistly

[2:21:06] <%imissedthat> that's true, but just admit the queue is stupid, and bullshit, and they should provide a better product

[2:21:58] <%cartakus> Said the hat fucker
[2:22:01] <@SoFarFetched> @imissedthat I mean the issue isn't "better product" its servers are literally dealing with a shit ton of people logging in at the same time. Which that's gonna happen like when sites crash horribly when a lot of people visit the site to get tickets to something
[2:22:05] <morcego_cinzento_arts> in the furry scale. the most desireable is Kellie Briggs from SwatKats and Cheetarah from Thundercats
[2:22:05] <$Sphincter_Spelunker> send link in chat
[2:22:06] <@CreepyPorpoise> The hrothgar "concept" i see tossed around most often is fanart

[2:25:58] <MarylandJutsu> @Sphincter_Spelunker they're the same in FF14's univerrse
[2:26:03] <@MelBrooksKA> Every time Paige laughs at a monster fucking up she immediately eats shit
[2:26:14] <TechnicalCultist> just got here, when did Paige go vtuber?
[2:26:15] <$StephanieSadGirl> @MelBrooksKA The phrase is literally 'talk shit get hit'
[2:26:16] <Laecerelius> Earlier I couldn't even connect to the data center to try and get on
[2:26:22] <morcego_cinzento_arts> funny enough the fem hrothgar kind remind me of the feline alien species in both Star Trek and Star Wars
[2:26:24] <@SoFarFetched> @TechnicalCultist about late july of this year
[2:26:28] <%Chichen> @Laecerelius RELOG fast and you stay in queue
[2:26:35] <Profmcstevie> Paige would evade the killer in a horror film and compulsively peak out and call them a bitch, dooming her
[2:26:35] <TechnicalCultist> damn, i'm way out of touch
[2:26:37] <Laecerelius> It's cool, I got to play like 18 hours yesterday
[2:26:37] <%Chichen> if you relog in fast you stay in your spot FFXIV homies.
[2:26:41] <MarylandJutsu> Its mostly depends on the time of day
[2:26:57] <+ForlornCarton> I got kicked at 90, but then logged in again immediately, and got right in
[2:27:10] <%cartakus> Luckyyyyyy
[2:27:11] <MarylandJutsu> like when its equvalent of after work hours/night FF14 is slammed
[2:27:14] <@SoFarFetched> yeah times seem to be way better when youre logging in after midnight.
[2:27:16] <%Spadoinkle> Turns out sleep is an elusive mistress. You still winning, son?
[2:27:28] <$StephanieSadGirl> Finish that Gen!  Finish that Gen!
[2:27:32] <+ForlornCarton> This is after being kicked about 5 times throughout the day though
[2:27:40] <+Ragnakawaii> This blight doing numbers
[2:27:55] <Mathochism> @Chichen Unless the lobby server stays down long enough that you can't get back in quick like it just did to me.
[2:27:55] <@SoFarFetched> yeah I think its pretty much everyone trying to play during the day to advance story as much as they can.
[2:28:07] <@SoFarFetched> IN the ass
