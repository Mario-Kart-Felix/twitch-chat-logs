[0:08:22] <BigFingerRo> at this pace, I'm like 20% convinced peaches will finish vanilla ds3 today
[0:08:22] <%Ziegsy> it was so good

[0:44:25] <freelancebabymaker> paige you NEED those eyes
[0:44:27] <%FacetiousAF> you should give those back
[0:44:30] <Monkeyweed21> @Ipsenscastle by the time Gundyr and the other champions woke up, it was too late and the Age of Dark was starting, so Ludleth sacrificed himself to sustain future Firelink Shrine, so that the Unkindled could travel back to before the fire went out and rekindle it using the other lords
[0:44:31] <blue8moon> blueberries
[0:44:33] <%VashyronM> you stole a blind woman's eyes peach

[0:44:42] <blue8moon> not all firekeepers are blind
[0:44:42] <DanThePumpkinman> aren't all fire keepers blind? isn't that the deal?
[0:44:46] <@PatStaresAt> @peachsaliva thats the item that unlocks endings 2 and 3.

[0:45:09] <G_Ship1> You know you could buy artorias stuff

[0:45:15] <%orpleborple> they are like olives
[0:45:15] <Teneb0r> Wow, that avatar is like the cutest ever. :3
[0:45:20] <%Bt_Robot> QUICKLY, PUT THOSE EYES, ON THE INSIDE!
[0:45:21] <blue8moon> Your firekeeper in DS1 wasn't blind, she was missing her tongue
[0:45:23] <freelancebabymaker> i am half ginger
[0:45:24] <%nip_nips> forbidden gushers
[0:45:25] <rekinom> Gingers stinky but in a good way
[0:45:27] <%LeiaSkynoober> @DanThePumpkinman No, each fire keeper gives some aspect of themself for fire keeper powers.
[0:45:28] <Quilltaz> Paige first instinct is to eat the eyes she stole from an old incapable lady
[0:45:28] <Jaysky> @Eightesu I thought that was her tongue not legs
[0:45:30] <KeiganOfAstora> I'm not ginger but I have red in my beard. Does that count?
[0:45:30] <+Patch_TheSquid> what about half-gingers?

[0:47:01] <+Axellogic> give EYES first
[0:47:02] <Monkeyweed21> @SoFarFetched bold of you to assume paige can read any of the text to begin with
[0:47:03] <TheEndlessRiver1> GIVE EYES TO FIRE
[0:47:03] <+Axellogic> EYES
[0:47:03] <cache_22> Dancer was such a cool fight.
[0:47:04] <mr_saturday93> How quickly she forgets
[0:47:06] <KeiganOfAstora> Archdragon Peak is for later, she's not ready for that
[0:47:09] <BoxNavy> dancing
[0:47:12] <%patriotrenegade> she can do the eyes later
[0:47:16] <%sick_kickflips> or are they
[0:47:19] <+Axellogic> Firekeeper needs those eyes

[0:47:21] <blue8moon> up ladder
[0:47:32] <BoxNavy> you. did it

[0:47:33] <Monkeyweed21> she has a bunch of other stuff to do first
[0:47:34] <+Axellogic> She's doomed to further blindness
[0:47:34] <%patriotrenegade> she could take Gael like this
[0:47:35] <$CanonHusbando> resistances just make the bars go up, if they're too high you see them kicking in when you're TPing
[0:47:35] <%dankjerri> G O UPPIES

[0:47:37] <tanarath> give firekeeper the eyes, Paige
[0:47:38] <BigFingerRo> OH FUCK YEAH ARCHDRAGON
[0:47:43] <@PatStaresAt> @PeachSaliva You now have the chance to do all 4 endings. You're succesfully unlocked the fourth and toughest, but if you want you can go back and get the base, or two more difficult ones
[0:47:46] <rosemon5001> she has that permanet debuff on her
[0:47:48] <+Mekhet09> I'm not even joking but you should take notes.

[0:48:12] <%nip_nips> paige what are your thoughts about DRAGONS?
[0:48:12] <+blastyoboots> The only reason the haters think your vtoobs are bigger than your normal ones is that your vtuber's arms and shoulders are so thin they're secretly skeleton arms. Also because they hate women and the ability to choose whichever cute virtual avatar you like
[0:48:13] <mr_saturday93> Archdragon peak is a bitch of a location

[1:08:38] <mr_saturday93> Snort that drink
[1:08:38] <$Sphincter_Spelunker> bone water
[1:08:42] <TrashManRising> Liquid bones for bone Mom
[1:08:42] <Tyrant_Bahamut> Paige loves skeletons so much she's incorporated them into her diet
[1:08:42] <%juxtest> Now your Estus Flask is stronger
[1:08:44] <thesugardaddy111> we in the bone zone now bois
[1:08:45] <%SpaghettiTime44> are you okay? why the broth if you don't mind me asking?
[1:08:46] <%sandrews> psaDogchamp
[1:08:49] <+Axellogic> will she see the items this time
[1:08:50] <+Cobaltor_252> GREAT START
[1:08:53] <+Axellogic> SHE DID IT
[1:09:00] <%JenovasPuppet> Wapeach is spelled deach
[1:09:01] <%EyeFarted> yay
[1:09:04] <%RayReborne> PEACH LOVE CHUNK
[1:09:05] <PleaseCallMeSugar> the bone broth made her play better
[1:09:06] <chimeraxmachina> Wait bone broth tastes good?
[1:09:07] <@SoFarFetched> SHE NEEDS TO FUEL HER BONES
[1:09:13] <holsety5> bone fuel
[1:09:16] <imagine_being_cringe> broth of the bones Kappa
[1:09:16] <blue8moon> well she is made of glass
[1:09:21] <G_Ship1> @axellogic she will…when pat finally points them out
[1:09:22] <%spitelite> but i oop
[1:09:25] <TrashManRising> She did the "But I oop" thing
[1:09:27] <%Zerenis> Paige seeks to steal the bone power from other creatures
[1:09:28] <BigFingerRo> so, Peach, you should make a big effort of hitting the feet
[1:09:33] <%Agami23> my brother has joint problems, so i might have to look into this for him
[1:09:40] <%SpaghettiTime44> alright! just curious
[1:09:45] <$CanonHusbando> also you're just wasting the bones if you don't cook them into broth
[1:09:45] <Broand> It's kind of soupish right
[1:09:46] <fugly_nick> Now go ring the bell
[1:09:47] <$Sphincter_Spelunker> @chimeraxmachina a lot of soup recipes use the animals bones instead of the meat as a base
[1:09:49] <Jetsfantasy> You hurt someone else's bones to make bone healing juice
[1:09:50] <Monkeyweed21> even bone in liquid form is stronger than Paige
[1:09:51] <freelancebabymaker> DAMN HER
[1:09:54] <BigFingerRo> THE BELL PAIGE
[1:10:01] <big_oistin> she must leech bone power
[1:10:05] <BigFingerRo> YESSSSSSSS
[1:10:07] <Broand> Like you use bone broth as a base for soups
[1:10:09] <thesugardaddy111> rip
[1:10:10] <%patriotrenegade> bit
[1:10:10] <$CanonHusbando> it being advertised as a health food is a new thing but bone froth is just like, how you should make broth
[1:10:11] <+Kobi_Robi_Tobi> Get necked
[1:10:11] <freelancebabymaker> MORTIS

[1:10:25] <%nip_nips> that bell is for look pretty, not for ring
[1:10:26] <BigFingerRo> Yeah, the bell totally rings
[1:10:32] <+Mendin> it's called STOCK
[1:10:33] <+Axellogic> drop bell from thoughts
[1:10:34] <KeiganOfAstora> hit the bell with an arrow
[1:10:35] <thesugardaddy111> bell is trap
[1:10:35] <%BinaryFireball> is it salty?
[1:10:39] <+RandyFistburgers> soop

[1:11:07] <RagnarokAM> I AM THE LAST ONE
[1:11:07] <@SoFarFetched> geefPoint
[1:11:09] <mr_sups> I AM THE LAST ONE!
[1:11:10] <KeiganOfAstora> It's great shut up
[1:11:11] <$CanonHusbando> the bell is to lure you into the arena so you get jumped by the dragon
[1:11:11] <snoozeaholic> You got to ring the bell with stormruler since there isn't enough wind power Kappa
[1:11:11] <BinaryBetrayer> "Good movie, don't watch it though"
[1:11:12] <%SpaghettiTime44> "don't rewatch it because it's actually not good"
[1:11:14] <+stickygumbolee> Dragonslayer>Dragonheart
[1:11:16] <+Ynkubus_> Dont tell me what to do
[1:11:17] <Coystick> To the stars Bowen, to the stars.. ;_;
[1:11:18] <+Anderobot> If only there were GLOWING MESSAGES ON THE FLOOR that gave you hints
[1:11:19] <%FacetiousAF> the chicken is spicy tonight
[1:11:23] <+Axellogic> "its super good but dont watch it it sucks"
[1:11:25] <%patriotrenegade> shut up
[1:11:26] <cache_22> There are 5 Dragonheart movies?
[1:11:29] <Quilltaz> Chat is really helpful, half tells a lie the other tells the truth and both sides just say shit too
[1:11:30] <KeiganOfAstora> yup
[1:11:31] <%Rumbutt> Dragonheart is amazing, and it's great that they never made a sequel
[1:11:32] <KeiganOfAstora> 5
[1:11:36] <$Sphincter_Spelunker> it's better with rose-tinted glasses
[1:11:36] <$CanonHusbando> it's super good but it sucks actually
[1:11:36] <blue8moon> why she no clear screen NotLikeThis
[1:11:38] <%nip_nips> im gonna watch the whole thing before she finishes this run
[1:11:43] <$CanonHusbando> only good in my nostalgia
[1:11:47] <$AzureGale> They may take our dragons but they will never take our FREEDOM
[1:11:47] <%JenovasPuppet> Stand in the dragon fire to absorb its power
[1:11:55] <Broand> I like soup. I know this one guy who makes a kickass curried parsnip soup
[1:12:06] <fugly_nick> @JenovasPuppet You gotta use Path of the Dragon first though
[1:12:11] <+MetroidSlayerP7> guilty pleasure fo sho
[1:12:13] <thesugardaddy111> man soup isn't a meal tho
[1:12:13] <RagnarokAM> Because chat will get bitchy about it. I hope Paige never clears screens
[1:12:14] <+twohitgood> dragon fire is pretty hott.
[1:12:16] <+FoolsArcade> you leave the item alert up for like 5 minutes a little bit ago
[1:12:17] <+Axellogic> now roll off the edge again
[1:12:20] <freelancebabymaker> you just keep leaving item pickeups on your screen for areally long time
[1:12:21] <%nip_nips> you gotta t-pose in front of the wyvern
[1:12:21] <thesugardaddy111> it's super not filling
[1:12:22] <$CanonHusbando> soup is absolutely a meal
[1:12:22] <%sandrews> It's better in my mind brain than in my eyes
[1:12:25] <G_Ship1> @binaryfireball it’s not if you make your own (season to taste) but store bought wise stock is less salty than broth and IMO more flavor
[1:12:25] <benjiFG> STINGER
[1:12:26] <%TheLakinessMonster> It's a time piece of a movie. doesn't stand up to today's quality, but the aesthetic and style was fun
[1:12:27] <$Sphincter_Spelunker> You make soup a meal with the fixings
[1:12:31] <SilverFaustX> AngelThump
[1:12:32] <+PenmanLupine> don't worry about it
[1:12:36] <$Sphincter_Spelunker> noodles, veggies etc
[1:12:46] <%SpaghettiTime44> yes, we can see
[1:12:46] <+Cobaltor_252> everything's fine
[1:12:47] <RagnarokAM> People are being tits, don't worry
[1:12:47] <thesugardaddy111> nah soup is an appetizer
[1:12:47] <%Grimlockfly> yeah, don't worry about it
[1:12:47] <KeiganOfAstora> KEEP GOING
[1:12:49] <%Grimlockfly> stay alive
[1:12:51] <KeiganOfAstora> IGNOR HIM
[1:12:52] <Omiba98> the screen has been cleared you're good
[1:12:53] <%juxtest> An item pickup notification was on screen for a bit
[1:12:53] <BinaryBetrayer> The real question is can you see, paige?
[1:12:53] <%Cafe_Spider> chat really is like a Ouija board sometimes
[1:12:55] <+PenmanLupine> it's fine, dude just had a moment and wanted to type things
[1:12:56] <Magicferret> Dragon fire really clears out the pores
[1:12:56] <%spitelite> good roll

[1:13:03] <freelancebabymaker> no its just that youre not clicking away the item pickup prompts sometimes
[1:13:03] <pabloelenano2> @PeachSaliva its because you didnt turn down 4 wat
[1:13:10] <Broand> Soup can be augmented for stronger meals, it's a versatile foodstuff!
[1:13:11] <+britishfrog> @PeachSaliva You caused quite a stir in PayMoneyWubby's chat :D
[1:13:11] <thesugardaddy111> the only way you can get full is by eating a absolute shit load of it

[1:13:58] <RagnarokAM> I actually adore this boss. It's a great change of pace from a 1v1 arena fight
[1:13:58] <%juxtest> Use Hammer to hit the snake guys at the dragon like a baseball
[1:14:01] <SideswipeV2> Rolling into combat is nuuuuuuuts
[1:14:02] <Kalcom> roll into it!
[1:14:07] <KeiganOfAstora> GO GO GO

[1:32:02] <$CanonHusbando> dragonslayer ornstein babey coolest MF in the series love that fursuiter
[1:32:07] <RagnarokAM> Always wanted to do a Spear only run
[1:32:07] <Prism_Wing> sexual
[1:32:08] <$Sphincter_Spelunker> @PeachSaliva Paige, what does Ornstein look like atpCap
[1:32:16] <Monkeyweed21> fun fact: you never met the real Ornstein in any of the games
[1:32:21] <%nip_nips> time is convoluted
[1:32:22] <RagnarokAM> You found an Illusion
[1:32:23] <peachy996> Or 2
[1:32:23] <+TacoSaIad> @anAngryHamster wait wut?
[1:32:24] <blue8moon> ghost ornstein
[1:32:31] <%JenovasPuppet> Dark Souls """"lore"""""
[1:32:32] <Monkeyweed21> Smough is real
[1:32:34] <Dunmarkh> who the fuck did you fight in 1,2, and 3????
[1:32:35] <$CanonHusbando> smaugh is real in DS1
[1:32:35] <TheEndlessRiver1> @PatStaresAt smough is real, you read he was the last defender
[1:32:36] <peachy996> Ornstein is in 3 diff games
[1:32:37] <%Grimlockfly> illusions, Michael
[1:32:37] <%AncelDeLambert> cuz someone could NEVER copy his armor in a new land
[1:32:38] <$SvenHolgersson> Smough was real
[1:32:39] <+babushkakoi> @Monkeyweed21 Not even in 1?
[1:32:41] <+BaddyBanterITV> liquid ornstein atpCap
[1:32:42] <%Agami23> smough might be real.
[1:32:42] <$SvenHolgersson> Ornstein wasn't
[1:32:42] <+tigerfang86> Smough is real and a big ol loser imo
[1:32:42] <%Rumbutt> nah, it's that Dark Souls 1 protag never made it that far in DS3 time line
[1:32:45] <%Draylle> sounds like a lame retcon
[1:32:46] <+Jonny_Worldbeater> TWO-HANDED THRUST. PIERCES DEEP.
[1:32:47] <%nip_nips> 2 was just an imposter in cosplay
[1:32:48] <blue8moon> gwyndolin made lots of illusions, not entirely out of the question
[1:32:52] <shotgang86> ...how?
[1:32:52] <%ElkRiverDog> Or a fanboy lugged the thing here
[1:32:53] <%AncelDeLambert> there's just no feasible way for someone to make a second set of armor, IT'S NOT POSSIBLE!
[1:33:00] <rosemon5001> i wonder how likely it is if there is a impossibly hidden use for the calamity ring like the coins in the demon souls remake
[1:33:00] <weissguard> Biggie was real, Smalls was not.
[1:33:03] <$CanonHusbando> theres an item in irithyl that says this lore
[1:33:04] <snoozeaholic> Illusions of the trap
[1:33:05] <weissguard> *Allegedly
[1:33:06] <+Dovah_Dogma> @peachsaliva are u guys doin MAGFest
[1:33:06] <RagnarokAM> Ornstein: You didn't win...
[1:33:07] <anAngryHamster> They just make it up as they go along
[1:33:09] <$CanonHusbando> I think it's smaugh's hammer?
[1:33:13] <peachy996> It's almost as if the writing in DS is stupid lol
[1:33:15] <@PatStaresAt> I LOVE THIS BSOS SO MUCH
[1:33:15] <+pwnjones> All hail the ORB, it has spoken
[1:33:21] <Arweynn> Also what was with ds2 abyss ornstein?

[1:33:37] <+tigerfang86> DRAGON NINJAS
[1:33:39] <%JenovasPuppet> Man just gotta get like 1 more strength or hammer upgrade and then these guys get one-shot
[1:33:41] <+Mendin> THIS ONE'S FOR YOU MORPH
[1:33:42] <%nip_nips> too much unga, not enough bunga
[1:33:42] <Dunmarkh> magfest is cursed
[1:33:45] <Monkeyweed21> @babushkakoi When Ornstein left to go find his master, he gave most of his soul to Gwyndolin and Gwynovere, Gwyndolin using it to defend Anor Londo and Gwyneve using it to make the Old Dragonslayer in Heide
[1:33:45] <%waltzqueen> MOR+IS
[1:33:54] <shotgang86> Magfest has a curse field
[1:34:01] <$Sphincter_Spelunker> and a new variant from Cuba :)
[1:34:04] <tanarath> please don't, delta is bad
[1:34:09] <%Agami23> poor projektmelody caught the covid.
[1:34:09] <+MetroidSlayerP7> delta sucks
[1:34:17] <%JenovasPuppet> Pointless Ahead
[1:34:18] <SilverFaustX> get your 3rd shot
[1:34:19] <shotgang86> ...delta is from india
[1:34:22] <+pwnjones> My best friend had short covid and died. Stay safe kids.
[1:34:26] <Jetsfantasy> @Agami23 Melody caught it?! I didn't hear about that
[1:34:27] <%JenovasPuppet> Best shortcut in the game!
[1:34:28] <benjiFG> useless shortcut mmm
[1:34:35] <@PatStaresAt> @PeachSaliva this shortcut is weirdly pointless
[1:34:37] <blue8moon> this shortcut is pretty useless
[1:34:39] <%patriotrenegade> This is literally the most baffling elevator in the game absolutely useless
[1:34:39] <tanarath> Delta IS from india, paige
[1:34:40] <$Sphincter_Spelunker> @shotgang86 yeah, there's more elsewhere
[1:34:40] <%Grimlockfly> this is the beginning of the area
[1:34:45] <%waltzqueen> @pwnjones my condolences
[1:34:51] <%nip_nips> Hurrah for pointless!
[1:34:51] <TrashManRising> Stay home and be safe, Mustard Mom.
[1:34:52] <+BaddyBanterITV> this shortcut is merely a cut
[1:34:55] <%ElkRiverDog> Honestly I recommend waiting another and waiting for all the anti-vaxxers to change their mind (or, yah know, have nature take its course)
[1:34:55] <$CanonHusbando> Sometimes they build the shortcuts before the place bonfires it’s fine
[1:35:02] <shotgang86> oh ok
[1:35:04] <%Sotetsu> Do you think it's unreasonable to not want to be around family that refuses to get a vaccine?
[1:35:04] <%Bluwizard21> @PeachSaliva I'm sure I will be called an idiot, but I am finally going to go and get vaccinated, While I fully endorse vaccinations I did not trust vaccines coming out as fast as they did with no real testing on them
[1:35:06] <+babushkakoi> @Monkeyweed21 Oh shit, I had no idea. I guess DS has more to teach us everyday lol
[1:35:06] <Jetsfantasy> Yeah, it came to florida and it's spreading
[1:35:08] <+pwnjones> We were really looking forward to Elden Ring
[1:35:09] <%JenovasPuppet> LUL
[1:35:10] <freelancebabymaker> yeah but if they cut this shortcut from the game people would spend like 6 years trying to put it back in tho
[1:35:12] <Dunmarkh> LUL
[1:35:15] <BigFingerRo> THE THREE PIECE
[1:35:15] <%JenovasPuppet> Stealth Havel strikes again!
[1:35:15] <%patriotrenegade> TOO HUGE
[1:35:18] <%maenos2> personally i'm not going ot any cons until at LEAST 2023
[1:35:19] <shotgang86> hey havel looking good
[1:35:20] <Filtiarn0914> LOL
[1:35:22] <+BaddyBanterITV> bonked
[1:35:22] <tanarath> nah, there's a worse varient of delta coming though.
[1:35:23] <bigboy3d> hopefully this new variant isn't worse
[1:35:23] <CollinsOfBodom> unstoppable force meets immovable object
[1:35:24] <%patriotrenegade> ROCKED
[1:35:25] <TimesApex> It's you but stronger
[1:35:26] <BigFingerRo> YOU GOT THE BISCUIT AND NO DRING
[1:35:27] <%Agami23> @Jetsfantasy yeah she made a tweet about it. its pinned on her twitter. worst part is she was vaccinated and still caught it
[1:35:30] <Dr_Mooose> can he sweep?
[1:35:35] <%nip_nips> @CanonHusbando then theres the back to back bonfires after the armor boi
[1:35:37] <Kalcom> why do you do this to yourself
[1:35:37] <%CptCreampuff16> did she ever finish demon ruins?
[1:35:45] <%patriotrenegade> She never did Demon Ruins
[1:35:51] <Jetsfantasy> @Agami23 Aww, poor Melody. Thanks for the info
[1:35:53] <BigFingerRo> @CptCreampuff16 NOPE
[1:35:54] <$CanonHusbando> See there is some dark souls 2 in here after all
[1:35:55] <%nip_nips> she stepped in the demom ruins and noped out
[1:35:57] <shieldecho> @Bluwizard21 The reason some vaccines take longer is because there's less need and less funding. In this case there was a global need so multiple countries funded it.
[1:36:01] <Monkeyweed21> @CptCreampuff16 she beat the boss and nothing else
[1:36:09] <Wiiplayah43> stupid sexy havel, rock hard Kappa
[1:36:15] <%JenovasPuppet> Really, I thought she beat Witch o' the Irish?
[1:36:22] <%patriotrenegade> Just like Pat, she missed 90% of the Demon Ruins
[1:36:24] <G_Ship1> So demon ruins is an option then…
[1:36:29] <%CptCreampuff16> yup
[1:36:40] <@PatStaresAt> Honestly Demon Ruins is awful and has no boss reward
[1:36:46] <$CanonHusbando> Demon ruins is mostly like upgrade mats
[1:36:47] <Wiiplayah43> @canonhusbando quite a bit, actually
[1:36:49] <sirrice77> idk if demon ruins is really any option, it has nothing she needs and it's a pain
[1:36:50] <%patriotrenegade> yeah but its an area
[1:36:51] <$Sphincter_Spelunker> @Agami23 vaccines protect from the more dire symptoms, everyone is likely to get covid at some point now.
[1:36:53] <%nip_nips> its only useful if you want the items
[1:37:01] <%JenovasPuppet> Yeah but it has spider wife :(
[1:37:05] <+tuifuiegoeris> oh no

[1:37:59] <%thejimjamz> Good evening peach- we still big and strong?
[1:38:00] <G_Ship1> @monkeyweed21 true FUGS is always fun
[1:38:03] <Wiiplayah43> @sirrice77 it's an option for the sake of content/completionism
[1:38:29] <%CptCreampuff16> i just like the quelana and fairlady grave in demon ruins
[1:38:31] <%patriotrenegade> @PeachSaliva Favorite song and moment in the Doomstar Requiem

[1:38:58] <sirrice77> @Wiiplayah43 i don't know if peach actually cares about that if its not a boss or some sort of cool lore thing
[1:39:05] <BigFingerRo> @patriotrenegade The duel
[1:39:13] <%nip_nips> this room is a miniboss for peach
[1:39:16] <Clyderso> hitbox
[1:39:18] <TrashManRising> That was a good fight

[1:40:57] <%nip_nips> it means shes SUPER GREGNANT
[1:40:58] <%FacetiousAF> have you considered chocolate is YUMMY?
[1:40:58] <Coystick> To feed the BABY
[1:40:59] <%Bluwizard21> or she's pmsing
[1:40:59] <blue8moon> chocolate is delicious
[1:41:00] <+dante_must_die_exe> r u bakin a bun in the oven, paige
[1:41:01] <%Zerenis> Pregananant
[1:41:03] <RagnarokAM> Way to know nothing about women, chat. Ya virgins
[1:41:04] <+RigmaroleHM> I constantly want chocolate
[1:41:04] <mr_saturday93> Because it's you Paige
[1:41:06] <%Agami23> whats your favorite kind of chocolate?
[1:41:07] <Eightesu> we want to see a baby
[1:41:08] <Monkeyweed21> you crave WIERD SHIT
[1:41:09] <%thejimjamz> Must feed babby choco latte

[1:41:10] <StarlitStunner> prognant brood
[1:41:11] <$CanonHusbando> I baked a chocolate cake this afternoon and I might just eat the whole thing
[1:41:13] <mr_saturday93> and we ar disgusting
[1:41:14] <ergulor> becuase if you get pregnant you will die
[1:41:15] <%JenovasPuppet> Oh wait, did you get that secret bonfire in the waterway?

[1:41:16] <SilverFaustX> because u break when the wind blows
[1:41:17] <Monkeyweed21> YOU DRINK PICKLES FFS
[1:41:18] <Maids4lyfe> it's pickles, if a woman wants pickles she's pregnant chocolate has nothing to do with it
[1:41:19] <CrimsonFox777> "It just means she wants some fuckin'..."
[1:41:20] <+NWR_James> Because "Gregnant" is a fun word
[1:41:20] <ChungusQuest> A woman requesting chocolate just means she's low on either HP or SAN points
[1:41:20] <+Romuken> We're concerned about the orb of broken bones you'd make.
[1:41:21] <Omiba98> now I want chocolate pretzels FeelsBadMan

[1:41:47] <%Bluwizard21> @PeachSaliva Nothing between you and Pat is normal, but yeah it would be healthy
[1:41:47] <%JenovasPuppet> Chestburster
[1:41:47] <tanarath> we worry
[1:41:48] <%nip_nips> mpreg

[1:41:52] <BoxNavy> shes right
[1:41:54] <%thejimjamz> Can confirm
[1:41:55] <RagnarokAM> Maybe a bunch of strangers on the internet SHOULDn'T take interest in a woman's reproduction
[1:41:55] <asdief_> no doubt
[1:41:58] <+NWR_James> have you asked your eye docor?
[1:42:00] <+RickyJZ> It's true, I crave chocolate 24/7
[1:42:01] <+tuifuiegoeris> Paige watching you play games makes me remember watching my sister play games for some reason. Maybe you just exude big sister energy I dunno.
[1:42:01] <SailingSaturn> Pat is Pregnant cirD
[1:42:05] <Melchior_the_Wise> would you Drink Papyrus if he was bone juice?
[1:42:06] <%king_wragles> You didn't specify whether or not the doctor confirmed you WOULDN'T give birth to a velociraptor
[1:42:07] <+Thesaltt> My wife told me she wouldn't die if she had a baby. Fool me once...
[1:42:07] <+tempestzephyr> pat is therefore always pregnant
[1:42:08] <%waltzqueen> @mr_saturday93 dude, what ,makes you think thats anokay thing to ask bruh
[1:42:08] <%nip_nips> the wombo combo
[1:42:13] <%ElkRiverDog> We are eager for the army of American/Canadian gingers who will take over the world
[1:42:17] <$CanonHusbando> Rife with atypical hunger
[1:42:17] <$Sphincter_Spelunker> I haven't craved chocolate in awhile. Guess I'm not ovulating

[1:42:29] <%patriotrenegade> BARELY
[1:42:30] <%FacetiousAF> put your dick away
[1:42:30] <Blank9> Be told about eyes on the inside.
[1:42:33] <B1ak3N1k05999> I haven’t had chocolate in a long while. What does it taste like?
[1:42:35] <%Bluwizard21> @PeachSaliva Can't you see you're pregnant?
[1:42:37] <%Zerenis> Hanging on by the skin of your teeth to regular enemies
[1:42:37] <+vaderxyz1970> What about your ENT doctor?
[1:42:41] <%king_wragles> It's kinda weird
[1:42:44] <RagnarokAM> It's kinda fucking awkward
[1:42:46] <freelancebabymaker> im sorry sir but youve been diagnosed with "submissive and breedable"

[1:42:55] <BoxNavy> yeah we know :)
[1:42:55] <el_r0berto> uterus*
[1:42:58] <+tuifuiegoeris> AZOTH
[1:42:59] <%king_wragles> Caramel is the better candy tho

[1:43:01] <Omiba98> chocolate good
[1:43:01] <+ZackTheGnomeChild> lol
[1:43:03] <BigFingerRo> I don't think of puss when I think pregnancy!
[1:43:04] <RagnarokAM> No, dig at them. Chat gotta grow up
[1:43:04] <Vadrigar1994> W O M B
[1:43:04] <ChungusQuest> "It's uter-US, not uter-U!"
[1:43:06] <rosemon5001> we want to imagine the ginger gremlin you two would produce
[1:43:06] <Kalcom> ok gregant
[1:43:08] <%FacetiousAF> eggs arent chocolate
[1:43:09] <hairtoday> yeah that's fair
[1:43:09] <BigFingerRo> I think of big belly
[1:43:12] <$Sphincter_Spelunker> atpCap
[1:43:12] <%Bluwizard21> @PeachSaliva Fair enough
[1:43:12] <tanarath> You're always surprising us with stuff
[1:43:14] <+BaddyBanterITV> I can't believe Pat is pregnant
[1:43:14] <+RigmaroleHM> Yeah, there's times in gatherings if I don't feel like drinking alcohol, the first question someone asks is PREGNANT?
[1:43:15] <+tuifuiegoeris> @PeachSaliva they want your azoth
[1:43:16] <BinaryBetrayer> Bitter Chocolate > Sweet Chocolate
[1:43:21] <+pwnjones> The pussy is just the hallway to the womb. The Vestibule, or Foyer if you will.
[1:43:23] <osuRohan> Autonomy is dead apparently
[1:43:24] <Broand> *kills snake man" haha it looks like an uncircumcised weiner
[1:43:26] <%RayReborne> I've never heard the chocolate = preggers thing lol
[1:43:28] <$KnivesEve> whats about wombs?? what xD
[1:43:30] <Melchior_the_Wise> because chat will raise your child Paige
[1:43:31] <%Roasted_Pheasant> Roasted_Pheasant subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 26 months, currently on a 13 month streak! "If I got pregnant it would be normal." she said. Knowing the kid would still be hers and Pats. Luvya, goblin queen! Fluff them gief n elmo butts.
[1:43:32] <tanarath> Also, Zangief & Elmo are the babies.
[1:43:34] <mr_saturday93> Paige I really REALLY don't want to think what's inside your womb or any of your nasty parts
[1:43:37] <%ElkRiverDog> As an Ace/Aro it's REALLY weird when people assume chocolate=wants baby for me
[1:43:40] <$CanonHusbando> to be fair you were singing about nut earlier
[1:43:42] <wolfen091> leave it to paige to make it weird
[1:43:44] <+Romuken> give chocolate beighnets from popeyes
[1:43:44] <%Bluwizard21> @BinaryBetrayer That's cause sweet chocolate is mostly just sugar
[1:43:45] <+The_I_T_Guy> because a genetic mashup between the ginger gremlin and the mustard queen sounds hilarious
[1:43:49] <RagnarokAM> Oh shit take that Chat
[1:43:49] <SilverFaustX> lol
[1:43:54] <KaiserMario> I thought your womb had nothing but mustard babies?
[1:43:57] <BigFingerRo> SQUINT
[1:43:59] <%Grimlockfly> curly chain safe
[1:44:01] <TheFramedWarlock> What females find it weird when we ask about the condition of their fetus chamber ? 2020Suspicious
[1:44:03] <%patriotrenegade> just smack it
[1:44:05] <+tuifuiegoeris> she had to lean away from the mic to breath out the gas
[1:44:07] <%JoshManVGH> Don't women typically have very weird cravings when pregnant? Like bubble gum ice cream and pickled bananas or something
[1:44:11] <+Mendin> Is that Zangief snoring?
[1:44:14] <$AzureGale> Yeah that's pretty fucking creepy
[1:44:15] <+MetroidSlayerP7> chocolate makes me thing about chocolate
[1:44:21] <%king_wragles> It's a flat screen, why are you trying to look around it?
[1:44:22] <%RayReborne> upset Wahmen? Time of the month obviously durr Kappa
[1:44:24] <HoldBtoRun> I hear about periods more in my daily work life than anything else, I'm just kind of conditioned to think about vaginas, it's not my fault
[1:44:24] <%patriotrenegade> @PeachSaliva Those are the Prince Lothric's clothes! Take a look!
[1:44:24] <%waltzqueen> @JoshManVGH you take that back! bubblegum ice cream is always god

[1:44:32] <$CanonHusbando> thinking about that bussy are you?
[1:44:33] <%Zerenis> Not everything has to be sexual
[1:44:35] <fluffy_sauce> because we care
[1:44:35] <%Bluwizard21> they would birth the next Louis C.K. A nasty talking sarcastic ginger gremlin
[1:44:36] <Monkeyweed21> look up
[1:44:38] <%CptCreampuff16> i just ask if they want me to make them spaghetti
[1:44:39] <mr_saturday93> It Paige was preggo would the child be functional unlike it's parents?
[1:44:39] <Melchior_the_Wise> paige is defensive because Porgnant is = Ture
[1:44:40] <+tempestzephyr> break the cycle
[1:44:41] <Melchior_the_Wise> Ture
[1:44:42] <%JoshManVGH> @waltzqueen holy shit that's a real thibg!?
[1:44:42] <Kalcom> "whatever gender" uhh
[1:44:43] <Teyaric> But the IDOL's illusion of AVAILABILITY

[1:44:47] <+1shoting> thanks paige i just choked
[1:44:49] <%peyodogo> i really appreciate that lil "whatever gender they are"
[1:44:51] <RagnarokAM> 'BeCauSe wE cAre'.
[1:44:53] <Blank9> If they ask me, that just means they think I'm looking submissive and breedable.
[1:44:55] <Monkeyweed21> you missed a whole path
[1:44:55] <Broand> my bussy is running right now

[1:45:10] <cache_22> You had the status effect that stops you from drinking
[1:45:10] <%patriotrenegade> @PeachSaliva Gundry was originally King Oceiros in the original build of DS3
[1:45:10] <BigFingerRo> YOU JUST STOOD THERE
[1:45:11] <+FoolsArcade> how can you be THIS blind

[1:45:24] <Vithaeria> some people is just too much
[1:45:24] <%ElkRiverDog> Look em in the eye and say "why are you interested? do you have mommy issues?"
[1:45:33] <$AzureGale> Though-uh
[1:45:36] <chimeraxmachina> Good rule of thumb not to ask people overly specific things about their bodies, unless you know them well. There’s so much subtle body policing especially for women..
[1:45:39] <%TheLakinessMonster> shots? this a drinking game because we can make it a drinking game
[1:45:43] <%RayReborne> no sunny D, instead sunny B for Bone Juice!

[2:47:16] <+TINMANxHMx> Paige, I took an 1800's coffin and turned it into a book shelf

[3:02:40] <+TINMANxHMx> F
[3:02:41] <%nip_nips> she thought it was a woman
[3:02:41] <+logoth_> Are they women?
[3:02:43] <+wolfofsound> she got the blood lust
[3:02:46] <Vithaeria> at least you got the elevator down, you've won
[3:02:48] <%Zerenis> That’s some good whimpering
[3:02:50] <mr_saturday93> Clip that
[3:02:53] <+Walopoh> compressed-voice Pat
[3:03:01] <$Sphincter_Spelunker> Should she do DLC before final boss?
[3:03:13] <%Agami23> i wish that i could have done boss invasions with the dragonslayer armor
[3:03:16] <+FingaLights> Be done before fall>!?!?!
[3:03:19] <BigYanno> Pat suddenly remembering how long the second DLC can be
[3:03:26] <%FacetiousAF> not even ashes??
[3:03:26] <Dunmarkh> get those paired greatswords
[3:03:32] <$Sphincter_Spelunker> you right
[3:03:40] <Vithaeria> its always a joke though
[3:03:43] <benjiFG> dlc's nutz lol
[3:03:44] <%doomunderthestairs> yeah easy peasy if you save it for last
[3:03:45] <Profmcstevie> big and strong is expected
[3:03:46] <%doomunderthestairs> dont do that
[3:03:47] <sirrice77> fair enough, im used to doing ashes early
[3:03:49] <%worldbrand> yeah looking at dragonslayer armor, it's gonna crumple
[3:03:52] <mr_saturday93> but this is Paige playing so....
[3:03:53] <sirrice77> but pat's right
[3:03:57] <%SophiaAmoreaVeritas> DLC 2 might as well be Dark Souls 4.
[3:03:58] <BinaryBetrayer> Somehow I can't see Paige beating either of the dlc bosses
[3:04:11] <Desthanos> But it's a nice send off of the series though.
[3:04:18] <+wolfofsound> same with me at 32, older and more run down version LUL
[3:04:18] <%MetroidSlayerP7> @worldbrand it's got crumple zones like a car lol
[3:04:22] <bosssbatttle> @BinaryBetrayer i can see that they are extremely hard
[3:04:23] <sirrice77> actually the final boss is fun on an sl1 run
[3:04:26] <BoxNavy> she did do that
[3:04:27] <+TINMANxHMx> I saved the final boss for last on my last playthrough... didnt really even have to try considering I was fresh off the bad ass in 2nd DLC
[3:04:29] <$Sphincter_Spelunker> Maybe she can go back to 2 and beat Fume
[3:04:34] <BigFingerRo> SHLUPPACUT
[3:04:37] <Wiiplayah43> it's really not a joke, they're just being macho
[3:04:38] <yukichocomilk> if she beat orphan she can do anything
[3:04:40] <%doomunderthestairs> i mean with mr hamma I thi
[3:04:41] <phantalime> lol if she did orphan she can do those bosses
[3:04:44] <%Zerenis> That was a completely different game, so……..
[3:04:47] <%doomunderthestairs> think shell be just fine
[3:04:48] <ManiacalLord> lol
[3:04:49] <Copious_Koopies> Midir will be fun to watch

[3:04:59] <filialpails> air support
[3:04:59] <%king_wragles> Fun fact: Paige got a near WR run on Ebriaetas
[3:05:01] <Monkeyweed21> I CAN GO TWICE AS HIGH
[3:05:02] <$Sphincter_Spelunker> cloudy with a chance of meatballs

[3:16:54] <PhantonBat> Not anymore
[3:16:55] <BigYanno> to be fair dodging into attacks usually works in dark souls due to the way the camera locks
[3:16:57] <TheAngryArtist> i knew it
[3:17:00] <+wolfofsound> man this year just melted
[3:17:00] <rudiciuscaesar> 45 minutes? Radical.

[3:17:14] <pretendofriendo> covid? pandemic? paige its 2007 let's play halo
[3:17:17] <BigYanno> it makes you roll around them if you're locked on rather than straight into them
[3:17:27] <rudiciuscaesar> lmao I would adore to see her and Pat try to co-op any Halo game.
[3:17:32] <BigYanno> Wait, does she have the calamity ring on?
[3:17:35] <+wolfofsound> god I wish it was 2007 again
[3:17:37] <+cubbywolf> see, you embrace defeat by sending the elevator back down
[3:17:41] <BigYanno> I SEE THA CALAMITY SYMBOL

[3:18:10] <+CatastropheCorvid> Prisoner's chain
[3:18:18] <Kalcom> remove limiters
[3:18:18] <rudiciuscaesar> That is the calamity ring's C symbol, right?
[3:18:24] <$SvenHolgersson> Need to stick close when he twohands it
[3:18:26] <RagnarokAM> Relax chat, it's the Prisoner Chain

[3:19:18] <+RickyJZ> No Puppet jinxed it
[3:19:19] <pretendofriendo> is that the Purdue's move set?
[3:19:19] <$SvenHolgersson> Can't roll away when he twohands it
[3:19:19] <Noktifer> Paige, ROLL ONCE, then attack, instead of rolling 3 times away from him
[3:19:20] <BigFingerRo> SUPREME SUPREME SUPREME
[3:19:20] <%SophiaAmoreaVeritas> Cheer245 You have a good approach. Pat is correct. Both are simultaneously true.
[3:19:23] <slimetus_ultima> bad reads NotLikeThis
[3:19:26] <ManiacalLord> Look, just wear the armor of thorns and roll at him
[3:19:27] <%EyeFarted> you unga'd when you should have bunga'd

[3:21:36] <$Sphincter_Spelunker> roll toward the wide swings
[3:21:37] <Zaphire_Saucypants> You can do it, Paige.

[3:23:21] <rudiciuscaesar> he is just a spirit in armor, right?
[3:23:24] <+Reyvierno> God gave Paige "The Lupis" for He feared what He created
[3:23:26] <$Sphincter_Spelunker> how can this be
[3:23:27] <BoxNavy> i think you gotta wait for him to do an attack before you heal
[3:23:28] <rudiciuscaesar> Paige doesn't afraid of anything?
[3:23:29] <mr_saturday93> BIG AND STRONG
[3:23:31] <Hydrapissed> HES POINTING TO THE BLEACHERS with that slam come on
[3:23:31] <BinaryBetrayer> because you wanted to show him that you don't care how long it takes

[3:23:52] <BigFingerRo> SLEEPING MAKES ME FEEL GOOD
[3:23:57] <Quilltaz> The penis in your heart makes you too brave not to take a 400 kilogram weapon smash to the face
[3:24:02] <rudiciuscaesar> Idk, I use super fast weapons like the mercenary twin sabers or whatever
[3:24:09] <+JustToWatch> I now realize that if the Pontiff had a shield Paige would still be fighting him
[3:24:11] <PhantonBat> "Why would I just stand there and take it?" Noramlly what Paige says on Saturday nights
[3:24:21] <rudiciuscaesar> now to me, Aldritch is a nightmare.
[3:24:21] <Hydrapissed> yehhh
[3:24:26] <rudiciuscaesar> he has funnels basically from Gundam
[3:25:11] <BigFingerRo> I love attacks that involve the shield too
[3:25:20] <BigFingerRo> are there bosses that are shield only?
[3:25:23] <+bustahwuulf> sandy, why cant we roll the other way?
[3:25:24] <TheAngryArtist> that's one pissed off suit of fuck
[3:25:25] <Teyaric> .... DID SHE JUST GUARD CRUSH HIM!?

[3:25:41] <%nip_nips> dont roll in a circle around him if you're trying to put distance
[3:25:41] <rudiciuscaesar> could she have verceraled or whatever
[3:25:44] <+FingaLights> She can not contain the murder
[3:25:44] <boomstickery> when you stagger him use that time to heal not hit
[3:25:45] <%Zerenis> Yeah she deals literally insane amounts of damage to the boss
[3:25:47] <%Agami23> when you hit his shield, try not to keep hitting his shield
[3:25:47] <%JenovasPuppet> You could use an ember for more health (and maybe a summon)
[3:25:47] <rudiciuscaesar> riposte the boss?
[3:25:47] <+JustToWatch> have you tried not getting hit
[3:25:47] <%AncelDeLambert> it might be you're out of gas

[3:26:55] <%Zerenis> Grumpy Peach is grumpy
[3:26:57] <glass_marcus> You have 12 Rolls for the rest of the stream. Use them wisely
[3:26:58] <%doomunderthestairs> you're doing ok for the most part its just that charge long swing that trips you up
[3:27:01] <Zaphire_Saucypants> The real truth. There was always a tiny Pat inside of Paige.
[3:27:02] <DianaTheAscian> This is a very Pat reaction
[3:27:05] <%AncelDeLambert> I say that with love, Paige
[3:27:05] <%doomunderthestairs> I forget how to avoid that one honestly
[3:27:06] <Jetsfantasy> Malicious compliance is a Pat thing too, ain't it? LUL
[3:27:07] <%RayReborne> only roll, don't attack Kappa
[3:27:07] <%Zerenis> You totally are
[3:27:07] <sydowoodo> maybe a break?????
[3:27:11] <%doomunderthestairs> once you get that you got it
[3:27:13] <%Ranryu692> Paige is active aggressive
[3:27:13] <RagnarokAM> How is This PASSIVE?
[3:27:14] <Dunmarkh> switch to a ranged bow and arrow builld
[3:27:15] <Hydrapissed> she is chat

[3:27:25] <%Zerenis> LUL that is exactly what you did
[3:27:25] <mrtanaka111> closeted passive agressive pech
[3:27:28] <+MilosolaireX> Those rolls would've saved you but the last one went side ways instead of back
[3:27:29] <$Sphincter_Spelunker> she's buttah
[3:27:30] <Teyaric> Seriously - You'll be amazed how effective just one roll AWAY from him then a little bit of walking away.
[3:27:30] <RagnarokAM> Oh my god shut up chat
[3:27:31] <%AncelDeLambert> aggressively sexual volpix
[3:27:31] <BinaryBetrayer> That was your one roll
[3:27:32] <slimetus_ultima> oh nvm
[3:27:32] <BigYanno> Have a break, have a kit-kat
[3:27:32] <+RickyJZ> No breaks. She's too close.
[3:27:32] <+JellyAndKake> you made it out of the midwest without being passive aggressive? How?
[3:27:34] <%Agami23> paige needs active aggression. beat his shit in

[3:27:39] <+bustahwuulf> ROLL ONCE AT A TIME
[3:27:39] <Kingjoker310> whats going i just got back whats happening
[3:27:40] <Hydrapissed> LETS NOT ROLL wooooo
[3:27:41] <%JenovasPuppet> One of those two thins!
[3:27:42] <$hattrick61> ONE ROLL AT A TIME
[3:27:43] <Hydrapissed> ZERO ROLL run
[3:27:44] <%Idziman> there's no passive aggression here, only active aggression Kappa
[3:27:44] <%TheWinged7> Paiges aggressive is not a passive, its an active ablility
[3:27:44] <rudiciuscaesar> Passive aggression Paige is clearly not a thing. Paige is either super assertive, or verbally aggressive.
[3:27:45] <mrtanaka111> win by only rolling
[3:27:46] <benjiFG> @PeachSaliva don't roll to create distance, only for invincibility
[3:27:48] <BigYanno> I don't want you to not roll
[3:27:49] <%EyeFarted> Nah, I'm just being anxious. I wanna see her beat him. Sorry if I'm being an ass.
[3:27:50] <mr_saturday93> NO LESS ROLL
[3:27:50] <SilverFaustX> keep more distance and wait for a opening
[3:27:51] <%nip_nips> roll to dodge a hit, not just spam roll
[3:27:54] <%ItsRatman> Roll decisively.
[3:27:54] <%JenovasPuppet> Roll just enough!
[3:27:54] <Zaphire_Saucypants> Roll to dodge, not to run away.
[3:27:56] <TheFramedWarlock> ONCE PER ATTACK
[3:27:56] <%SophiaAmoreaVeritas> Time your roll to the movement of your opponent.
[3:27:57] <+Mekhet09> You keep panick rolling.
[3:27:57] <%Rumbutt> you should roll only to dodge attacks
[3:27:58] <Jetsfantasy> No double rolling I think they're saying
[3:27:59] <yukichocomilk> roll to dodge attacks but don't panic
[3:27:59] <%Marzby> SLAP
[3:27:59] <Teyaric> WALK
[3:28:00] <Dunmarkh> sprint
[3:28:00] <mr_saturday93> don't spam it
[3:28:00] <Bloodninja15> Just stop panic rolling
[3:28:01] <phantalime> run
[3:28:01] <BigFingerRo> Change weapons?
[3:28:01] <bosssbatttle> dont spam roll
[3:28:01] <%nip_nips> RUN for distance
[3:28:02] <$hattrick61> unbind your o button
[3:28:02] <Hydrapissed> u need to just roll hes hits and nothing else ur rolling away to much u can just run away if u want
[3:28:03] <glass_marcus> run
[3:28:03] <strangelee> Walk away
[3:28:03] <%Zerenis> You should only be rolling through his attacks. Other than that you can run
[3:28:03] <+Inferno_Icon> Dont panic roll
[3:28:03] <+FoolsArcade> walk
[3:28:04] <Profmcstevie> with legs
[3:28:04] <+ALazo> use your feetsies
[3:28:04] <SilverFaustX> run
[3:28:05] <hairtoday> roll right on the two-handed dash
[3:28:05] <lazylazzer> Distance is for cowards. Hug your foes.
[3:28:06] <+JustToWatch> 10% less rolls
[3:28:07] <Baarthas> that's the neat part, you don't
[3:28:08] <Noktifer> YOU DON'T
[3:28:08] <%SveriSageAdvice> i cant say anything because i roll my way to victory on this boss fight lol, i roll so far away
[3:28:10] <BigYanno> move the stick in the direction he is
[3:28:10] <%Rumbutt> sprint to create distance, or just move back
[3:28:11] <+babushkakoi> You do fine in the first half but start panic rolling in his last half
[3:28:15] <Jetsfantasy> Walk back, you regen stamina while doing it
[3:28:18] <+Epic_Fubar> run away
[3:28:19] <Noktifer> Stay in on him and stay to HIS right side. So, MOVE LEFT OF HIM
[3:28:21] <Mr_JustinJones> Just pay to your stamina
[3:28:21] <%ItsRatman> Why do you need distance? Just let them come to you
[3:28:22] <leinadtonu> run away
[3:28:23] <mrtanaka111> just listen to all of us at same time, focus and roll by not rolling
[3:28:24] <$hattrick61> Respec into a miracle build
[3:28:27] <BigFingerRo> maybe peach needs to change weapons? just as a change of scenery
[3:28:29] <BinaryBetrayer> When he starts charging that giant area of effect attack you should roll out of the way because it throws you off and deals massive damage.
[3:28:29] <rudiciuscaesar> don't run, use the normal character speed, you can really circling him easily.
[3:28:30] <TheFramedWarlock> Each attack only needs one roll, rolling more than that will throw off your rhythm
[3:28:30] <%Zerenis> Like anytime you are rolling four-five times just to get away from the boss you should be running instead
[3:28:31] <+FoolsArcade> only roll when you see the attack coming toward you, not when its charging up
[3:28:32] <awfully_crispy> Good luck Paige!
[3:28:32] <+MilosolaireX> just keep rolling it was working
[3:28:35] <slimetus_ultima> peachis enslaved y habits tho
[3:28:38] <%EyeFarted> Sorry about this everyone...
[3:28:39] <%Marzby> Fuck it just have fun
[3:28:39] <%JenovasPuppet> Just do it perfectly.
[3:28:39] <+FingaLights> Oh no, the concessive advice frome 1000 people
[3:28:40] <+Archphronimos> you could also ember up for more health
[3:28:41] <+TheShal> Just don't get hit /s
[3:28:41] <%nip_nips> do every contrary statement at once
[3:28:41] <leinadtonu> run away then come back rolling
[3:28:45] <rudiciuscaesar> you can do it Paige, crush the boss.
[3:28:46] <mrtanaka111> dont try
[3:28:47] <TheHeroAppears> only roll when you feel the need deep in your heart
[3:28:48] <+JustToWatch> damn we're good at this advice thing
[3:28:48] <mrtanaka111> jesus
[3:28:49] <+Epic_Fubar> just vibe it
[3:28:51] <slimetus_ultima> JUST GO APE SHIT
[3:28:52] <+GinAndRoses> active aggressive
[3:28:53] <BigYanno> put on all the rings that improce your rolling
[3:28:56] <$hattrick61> Remember you can go right by turning left
[3:28:56] <PleaseCallMeSugar> could it be that she's not mathematically benefiting enough from the Prisoner's Ring to offset the extra damage it makes her take?
[3:28:59] <$Sphincter_Spelunker> damn
[3:29:00] <Hydrapissed> and a lil racist
[3:29:01] <valerios_> ayyyyy
[3:29:01] <blue8moon> passive ain't paige's style Kappa
[3:29:07] <+lordericter> Hey its ornsteins corpse
[3:29:07] <%grapplingwithdepression> Im highlighting my message because i guess i have points. Just don't get hit its the key to winning.
[3:29:08] <%Zerenis> “Fine, I just won’t roll then” that’s passive aggressive
[3:29:11] <mrtanaka111> WHY ARE YOU NOT ROLLING
[3:29:15] <+goose_attack_almanac> (she is not joking)
[3:29:23] <HawkHollywood> she isn't passive aggressive she's aggressively passive
[3:29:24] <%JenovasPuppet> Now see you shoulda rolled there.
[3:29:24] <floralkami> I swear, your body language is perfect for vTubing
[3:29:24] <%grapplingwithdepression> You see you got hit
[3:29:24] <Hydrapissed> THE GIGA SHIELD BASH
[3:29:25] <+bustahwuulf> Do you rhythm game?
[3:29:28] <+RickyJZ> @mrtanaka111 stop
[3:29:32] <$hattrick61> OK NOW ROLL HARDER
[3:29:32] <SilverFaustX> dont hit it 3 times in a row
[3:29:37] <$Sphincter_Spelunker> you swung at his shield tho
[3:29:38] <+Sendrak70> Next advice, ember up and summon help.
[3:29:39] <%nip_nips> you didnt roll when he was swinging at you though
[3:29:40] <slimetus_ultima> ok nvm HE WENT APE SHIT
[3:29:40] <BigFingerRo> "I ROLLED DOO!" DSPaige
[3:29:41] <%SophiaAmoreaVeritas> That was better in some ways.
[3:29:42] <+babushkakoi> Strafing also helps when he does a shield bash
[3:29:43] <+vicar_anat> Autobots, ROLL OUT!
[3:29:44] <Dunmarkh> now do it again, WITH FEELING
[3:29:45] <BigYanno> OK, new plan. Completely respec as a mage.
[3:29:51] <cache_22> Is positioning towards the shield side (right) better than the sword side?
[3:29:51] <yukichocomilk> just fight it until you learn LUL no need for any tips
[3:29:52] <%Draylle> hit and run tactics basically
[3:29:52] <%nip_nips> dont hit shield
[3:29:52] <%AncelDeLambert> how's your blood sugar doin
[3:29:53] <Hydrapissed> remebmer u can roll then hit btw
[3:29:53] <SeelessButts> You must paint the fence and wash the car, just like Mr. Miagi said @PeachSaliva
[3:29:53] <%SveriSageAdvice> one big thing to help, this boss sucks ass at turning, keep making him turn and he'll eventually start swinging at nothing
[3:29:53] <Mr_JustinJones> Do Less
[3:29:53] <rudiciuscaesar> Count your swings if you have to
[3:29:54] <leinadtonu> you're getting it tho.
[3:29:56] <+FingaLights> Shield do not give damage
[3:29:56] <floralkami> hit twice, roll out?
[3:29:57] <mrtanaka111> but are you counting your rolls?
[3:29:58] <+bustahwuulf> be 20% more aggressive
[3:29:58] <+Double_negative> I think you should switch to a faster weapon honestly.
[3:29:58] <rudiciuscaesar> you did it before and it worked every time.
[3:29:59] <+Reyvierno> Pull out a gun
[3:30:00] <+FoolsArcade> 2 hits, roll to escape attack, 2 hits, roll 2 escape attack
[3:30:00] <@commanderclaw> Just hit once at a time
[3:30:00] <glass_marcus> The idea is just stamina conservation
[3:30:01] <NeoSoundBox> circle strafe
[3:30:02] <%AncelDeLambert> patience, young padawan
[3:30:03] <%ItsRatman> New plan: Give chat the controller
[3:30:03] <sirrice77> okay so don't attack his shield at all, it's not gonna work
[3:30:03] <%nip_nips> hitting shield not do damage
[3:30:03] <+TMulharin> hit 50% less
[3:30:03] <+JustToWatch> do 100$ better
[3:30:04] <%Rumbutt> dodge, swing/heal, then wait for the next atatck, repeat
[3:30:05] <%Agami23> he holds up his shield and blocks your attacks.
[3:30:06] <Hydrapissed> u have an evade attack to btw
[3:30:06] <bosssbatttle> hit 1 or twice and roll once per his attacks
[3:30:07] <@SoFarFetched> @mrtanaka111 why would she count? Kappa
[3:30:07] <Dunmarkh> try pyromancy
[3:30:07] <$Sphincter_Spelunker> @PeachSaliva roll to dodge, run for distance, swing twice
[3:30:08] <+Epic_Fubar> don't die
[3:30:08] <Mr_JustinJones> Pay attention to your stamina
[3:30:08] <albret__einstrong> die 20 percent less
[3:30:09] <%Psych_man13_13> Don’t hit shield
[3:30:10] <TheHeroAppears> 100% reason to remember the name
[3:30:11] <andiianfii> narrate your actions
[3:30:13] <BigFingerRo> @BigYanno I like this plan, let's switch over to a mod while we're at it
[3:30:14] <%femto216> It reminds me of my 20 attempts
[3:30:16] <+Inferno_Icon> Dont go in when you shield break its a trap
[3:30:16] <slimetus_ultima> twist his dicc
[3:30:18] <Kingjoker310> dont do anything just stand there bitterLUL
[3:30:21] <BigYanno> roll to his left
[3:30:23] <$hattrick61> respec into archery build
[3:30:26] <%JenovasPuppet> Equip thorn armor and then roll to your hearts content!
[3:30:29] <$Sphincter_Spelunker> he has none
[3:30:29] <Hydrapissed> ur evade attack is pretty fast to btw dont gata stand then swing as well
[3:30:29] <psychoteletubby7> @PeachSaliva use the fountain in the middle if you need space
[3:30:32] <leinadtonu> roll like a butterfly, sting like a roll!
[3:30:32] <peachy996> butthole
[3:30:33] <%SveriSageAdvice> boss sucks at turning, he will eventually swing at nothing lol
[3:30:33] <+JustToWatch> I fucked up I meant 100%
[3:30:34] <%BinaryFireball> twist and pull
[3:30:34] <+MilosolaireX> no plan just believe
[3:30:35] <%nip_nips> twist his dick right off
[3:30:36] <floralkami> roll over his dick
[3:30:37] <pretendofriendo> telegraphs this by taking out his weapon and slowly brandishing it to the sky. With an approximately 1-second delay after he finishes, a lightning strike will be summoned directly over you,
[3:30:39] <%Idziman> the ol' Dick Twist
[3:30:39] <peachy996> that is my sage advice
[3:30:40] <%baronblank> give em the ooooool' dick twist
[3:30:40] <BigYanno> It's just a suit of armor, it doesn't have a dick
[3:30:41] <mrtanaka111> roll twice as much as you attack and only 1/4 of as much as yous huffle
[3:30:41] <BinaryBetrayer> But what if he's into it?
[3:30:41] <TheFramedWarlock> Roll once per attack and only attack once, when you are sure you've got an opening so you don't overcommit and get knocked out of it or have it blocked
[3:30:44] <slimetus_ultima> twisty right off

[3:33:48] <$Sphincter_Spelunker> tastes like defeat
[3:33:48] <ergulor> ike floor
[3:33:49] <+RickyJZ> That was a really great run. The opening when you kept dodging to his backside and then counter-striking him was excellent.
[3:33:51] <TheAngryArtist> im so mad
[3:33:53] <rudiciuscaesar> Ring out, she got Astaroth'ed
[3:33:55] <leinadtonu> tasted like ROLIN'

[3:34:06] <ergulor> with a delay or...?
[3:34:09] <BinaryBetrayer> I've learned to know the taste of Concrete
[3:34:09] <andiianfii> fucking understandable
[3:34:10] <+GinAndRoses> i'm blaming pat
[3:34:12] <phantalime> technically you got wiped OFF the floor
[3:34:12] <Armadelus> I particularly enjoyed the look on her avatars face.
[3:34:12] <Hydrapissed> it pats fault
[3:34:13] <PleaseCallMeSugar> wow she really did get wiped with the floor huh
[3:34:13] <+polothegreatest> intoxicating like alcohol HSCheers
[3:34:17] <PhantonBat> Eat floor, high in fibre
[3:34:20] <+nial_evol> all natural choke
[3:34:21] <BoxNavy> you farted haha
[3:34:21] <andiianfii> howe could pat do this
[3:34:21] <mr_saturday93> I'm getting flashbacks to when Pat fought that one boss in DS3 dlc
[3:34:22] <floralkami> LUL
[3:34:22] <leinadtonu> but blaming Pat is fun...
[3:34:22] <Monkeyweed21> you were doing amazing
[3:34:24] <albret__einstrong> tasted ike twisted dick.
[3:34:24] <%king_wragles> Can WE blame Pat?
[3:34:24] <cache_22> Can we blame Pat anyways?
[3:34:25] <Dunmarkh> I did this? Pat did this
[3:34:25] <psychoteletubby7> can I blame pat?
[3:34:28] <BigFingerRo> That was the worst luck I've ever seen
[3:34:30] <Armadelus> The look of horror and mortification
[3:34:33] <Jetsfantasy> Take a deep breath, you've got this.
[3:34:36] <%SophiaAmoreaVeritas> Cheer200 You were doing exactly what you need to do for 80% of the boss fight.
[3:34:39] <Tahzani> You did a lot better than me when I tried this guy
[3:34:40] <sydowoodo> can chat blame pat
[3:34:40] <floralkami> "That was aaaaaalll me... I Farted"
[3:34:42] <TheAngryArtist> it technically is pats fault, he got her to play these games.
[3:34:45] <+FingaLights> I get that, I have the same thing
[3:34:50] <+RickyJZ> seriously though that last attempt was great. Keep that up and you'll get this guy no sweat.
[3:34:51] <%Bt_Robot> RESTING BITCH VOICE?
[3:34:51] <BoxNavy> :)
[3:34:56] <+Inferno_Icon> Your tone-uh
[3:34:56] <RagnarokAM> My Girlfriend is the same way too. She has pissed off a lot of people sadly
[3:34:57] <slimetus_ultima> she got this
[3:35:00] <slimetus_ultima> you got this
[3:35:04] <Drenik74> :s
[3:35:07] <+JustToWatch> I'm sure Pat is at least a LITTLE at fault
[3:35:08] <BigYanno> Wait, I have an idea. Put the ring taht makes you invisible when you roll. That with the dancer's veil will disorientate the armor and make it fall apart mentally
[3:35:08] <leinadtonu> THE ROLLIN' ZONE!
[3:35:09] <$Sphincter_Spelunker> audrey plaza
[3:35:09] <%AncelDeLambert> we can always blame Pat
[3:35:10] <pretendofriendo> His waist-level charged lunge. This attack cannot be blocked or dodged sideways, though it can be rolled through.
[3:35:12] <PhantonBat> Oh we playing?
[3:35:19] <ManiacalLord> My wife is the same lol
[3:35:20] <PhantonBat> Shut up Meg
[3:35:20] <+polothegreatest> psaCanada sipsipRude
[3:35:20] <floralkami> I have that, but with my face
[3:35:21] <%Grimlockfly> when in doubt, blame pat
[3:35:22] <%Zerenis> You will definitely win in one of the next 13 attempts
[3:35:22] <Zaphire_Saucypants> I'm the same way, face and voice.
[3:35:22] <BigFingerRo> Here's the jinx: You will win this time
[3:35:25] <rudiciuscaesar> I know what you mean about that tone thing, whenever I'm out of my home state people can't understand me, they get frustrated, and then when i switch to normal English, they assume I'm being a bitch.
[3:35:25] <+Daigrey> beliebe in youself

[3:38:19] <SilverFaustX> keep range
[3:38:20] <rudiciuscaesar> oh he destroys the railings!
[3:38:21] <%nip_nips> greed is more dangerous than the boss
[3:38:39] <%king_wragles> @rekinom Pretends huh?
[3:38:41] <Wiiplayah43> @bigyanno he doesn't
[3:38:42] <PhiloRobo> You can do it!
[3:38:46] <%grapplingwithdepression> Pat knows that if he unleashed his cool with his dashing looks he would outgrow the podcast and honestly twitch itself
[3:38:47] <BigYanno> The first and only advice I seriously give people for Dark Souls games is Don't Get Greedy
[3:38:47] <Quilltaz> Yo this armor dude using ki blasts man, this really is dragon balls
[3:38:47] <Vithaeria> @BigYanno well, it's not like that, it's just once
[3:38:48] <Drenik74> Just give them a hug maybe
[3:38:51] <AVkid_> lmao its like you're clicking on a soundboard of swears
[3:38:52] <BigYanno> @Wiiplayah43 shhhhh
[3:39:00] <Hydrapissed> WOOF
[3:39:00] <%grapplingwithdepression> he limits himself for us, so that we may enjoy him on this free service

[3:39:05] <rudiciuscaesar> WHAT?!
[3:39:08] <%Draylle> this boss is real jerk
[3:39:10] <andiianfii> greedy for heals
[3:39:10] <rudiciuscaesar> that was max range, I thought he missed.

[3:39:11] <derap41> Got outbonked
[3:39:13] <+gogorobotz> alluuxWhy alluuxWhy alluuxWhy
[3:39:14] <RagnarokAM> Let's blame that on Pat being hot
[3:39:16] <%nip_nips> too thirsty
[3:39:16] <+Ralen_Sharr> what about getting help? is that still a thing in DS?
[3:39:17] <pretendofriendo> you were doing so well
[3:39:18] <Noktifer> @PeachSaliva Do you look at your character or the boss?
[3:39:18] <@commanderclaw> You were doing better, you've got this!
[3:39:19] <TheAngryArtist> BibleThump
[3:39:26] <%Bt_Robot> THE BEST PLACE TO BE IN THIS FIGHT IS RIGHT BEHIND THE BOSS
[3:39:26] <ManiacalLord> It was pat's fault
[3:39:26] <%Agami23> that projectile sucks, i forgot he could do that
[3:39:27] <Kingjoker310> you almost got it
[3:39:28] <%Draylle> you're doing really good tho,
[3:39:29] <%SophiaAmoreaVeritas> this is a strong boss
[3:39:30] <%JenovasPuppet> Extreme got this
[3:39:30] <Dunmarkh> *succ*
[3:39:30] <slimetus_ultima> you didnt twist his dick NotLikeThis
[3:39:31] <Vithaeria> getting closer
[3:39:32] <rudiciuscaesar> are there any NPCs that can help?
[3:39:33] <%EyeFarted> hives?
[3:39:33] <PhiloRobo> I think that guy was cheating
[3:39:36] <rudiciuscaesar> I can't remember.
[3:39:37] <mr_saturday93> That attack has range. AND TIP; she. he swings his shield dodge to his right
[3:39:40] <+RickyJZ> That was a another good run. Now it's just a matter of memorizing his moveset
[3:39:40] <%Psych_man13_13> Distracted by Pats hot bod
[3:39:45] <Noktifer> Focus on the boss, and whenever he charges up, wait for his start up and then roll AT HIM.
[3:39:47] <Hydrapissed> sorry
[3:39:47] <mrtanaka111> should be looking at chat...
[3:39:49] <BigYanno> Some of his hitboxes can be weird
[3:39:52] <TheAngryArtist> eyetracker when?
[3:39:52] <%Bt_Robot> HE HAS LOTS OF SUPER MOVES FOR MID AND LONG RANGE THAT ARE DIFFICULT TO AVOID
[3:39:53] <+FingaLights> Bee hives?
[3:39:54] <%grapplingwithdepression> Hey peach do you find this vtubin setup makes you feel more relaxed streamin?
[3:39:55] <leinadtonu> just play blindfolded to avoid distractions
[3:39:55] <derap41> Did Paige make her boobos even bigger?
[3:40:01] <slimetus_ultima> off hives\
[3:40:08] <%nip_nips> they grow every stream
[3:40:11] <Dunmarkh> @derap41 that's where the bees come out of
[3:40:11] <%EyeFarted> The bees are trying to sleep.
[3:40:12] <%Draylle> you sure?
[3:40:13] <BoxNavy> boobo
[3:40:14] <Hydrapissed> put them to age 99
[3:40:14] <rudiciuscaesar> I had hives once, Idk how you grew to tolerate that, I mean, I guess by necessity, sorry.
[3:40:14] <Zaphire_Saucypants> nothin to keep one self-conscious than a v-tuber rig.
[3:40:14] <+bustahwuulf> they get bigger every stream
[3:40:15] <%ItsRatman> Did you?
[3:40:15] <%Estuko> People were so scared lol
[3:40:16] <peachy996> I think you're doing fine. Just don't feel pressured to beat it as much
[3:40:16] <RagnarokAM> I get them late at night too. It's actually due to our energy level and the body's fatigue levels
[3:40:17] <Jetsfantasy> You turned them down?
[3:40:18] <Ner234> Boobs are scary
[3:40:19] <+wolfofsound> titties should be motionless!
[3:40:19] <awfully_crispy> does pat like cooking?
[3:40:22] <%Agami23> because people are cowards
[3:40:22] <floralkami> there were jiggle physics?
[3:40:24] <DancesWitBalrog> hi Paige HungryPaimon
[3:40:24] <mr_saturday93> going to take a shower so I hope ya win while I'm doing that Paige
[3:40:24] <Kingjoker310> its still jigglely
[3:40:25] <%JenovasPuppet> Did you hit Apply?
[3:40:25] <Dunmarkh> Crank that shit up
[3:40:25] <Kalcom> jiggle is not size
[3:40:26] <%Ranryu692> Paige turned down her DOA Age slider
[3:40:27] <zenith0111> Less jiggle = more perk
[3:40:27] <gyabs> TURN THEM BACK UP
[3:40:27] <BinaryBetrayer> You should turn it up to eleven
[3:40:28] <pretendofriendo> 👁👄👁
[3:40:28] <klooswep> big ears big hair big boobs
[3:40:29] <Monkeyweed21> they looked like the DoA water balloons
[3:40:30] <BigYanno> Well to be fair they are bigger than her head
[3:40:30] <andiianfii> need a test stream with maximum jiggle
[3:40:31] <Angerest> BIGGER JIGGLIER
[3:40:31] <+Hilleltaco> they were moving too fast i felt threatened
[3:40:32] <leinadtonu> max boob physics
[3:40:32] <%Zerenis> Maybe cause boobas don’t jiggle for 30 seconds after barely moving?
[3:40:35] <+goose_attack_almanac> People are afraid of breasts
[3:40:36] <slimetus_ultima> You heard it here frist, BOOBA freaks PPL out
[3:40:38] <ergulor> can you put it at max level i want to see how crazy it gets
[3:40:38] <%Grimlockfly> Mo jiggle
[3:40:38] <+TopTieramisu> just use the transform tool
[3:40:39] <+the22cstomp> you should increase them by .1% every stream just to gaslight chat
[3:40:40] <filialpails> COWARDS ALL
[3:40:41] <+Reyvierno> Turn jiggle to MAX. I want DoA Beach Volleyball physics in this bitch.
[3:40:42] <PhiloRobo> They should have over-reactive physics, like superball levels of bounce
[3:40:42] <+FingaLights> "80% of the model please"
[3:40:48] <%Agami23> wispering is such a good artist
[3:40:48] <+TMulharin> What if you made the rest of the model smaller instead?
[3:40:49] <Quilltaz> Crank it up so much that it rivals that zombie anime
[3:40:50] <cooldude69xx> Go up a cup for every guy who complains.
[3:40:50] <%MetroidSlayerP7> Booba Fett
[3:40:50] <tanarath> @floralkami there still are, they turned them way down.
[3:40:51] <rudiciuscaesar> top offffff
[3:40:53] <Jetsfantasy> Honestly I find it hilarious and I'd lean into the anime just to spite
[3:40:54] <rudiciuscaesar> HP lowwww
[3:40:55] <weissguard> mmhmm. Lots of Art
[3:41:01] <slimetus_ultima> bad reads oof
[3:41:03] <Dunmarkh> Whispering, I NEED MORE POWER
[3:41:09] <%Grimlockfly> Whispering, this is an emergency, a BOOB EMERGENCY
[3:41:11] <AVkid_> "freaked people out" lol "AAAGH! THEY'RE JIGGLING!"
[3:41:14] <+shootbang_exe> honestly paige should just drag a jpg of a toilet on screen whenever pat stops by to help
[3:41:17] <%Zerenis> Greed
[3:41:19] <%king_wragles> The hitbox on that is fucked
[3:41:20] <+TopTieramisu> watch out paige
[3:41:22] <Quilltaz> Whispering takes payment per boob mass instead of per hour
[3:41:23] <Vithaeria> i actually like that she is failing this much because i get to hear the music
[3:41:24] <floralkami> @tanarath cowards, the whole lot of them who freaked
[3:41:24] <%grapplingwithdepression> can you roll into that swipe?
[3:41:30] <Hydrapissed> people are fucking weird man
[3:41:31] <SpaceCapnCrone> that one was to lure him off guard, it's the long game.
[3:41:31] <%nip_nips> people are scared of booba
[3:41:32] <derap41> This guy looks like a spikey ninja turtle
[3:41:33] <TheFramedWarlock> SUUUPERSIIIIIZE MEEEEEEE
[3:41:34] <%JenovasPuppet> Paige was distracted by her own vboobers
[3:41:34] <mrtanaka111> im freaked out
[3:41:36] <AVkid_> good jeezus lol
[3:41:37] <%MetroidSlayerP7> Internet is fucked
[3:41:39] <BoxNavy> people are very weird about boobs for some reason
[3:41:39] <%king_wragles> Sounds like their problem
[3:41:41] <+the22cstomp> why are people scared of a model
[3:41:41] <peachy996> They are intimidated by the boobs
[3:41:41] <zenith0111> Think you sold out? LUL
[3:41:41] <@commanderclaw> What about your fluffy tail tho
[3:41:42] <tanarath> Better rolling this time, Paige, but work on it more, you're doing great.
[3:41:43] <+FingaLights> ????
[3:41:43] <PhiloRobo> Man those people wouldn't be able to handle some of those hololive chicks, huh?
[3:41:44] <pretendofriendo> it's the THRID HIT after that stagger gets you in trouble🥺
[3:41:45] <+polothegreatest> LUL
[3:41:46] <rudiciuscaesar> yeah, her original boobie bounce was like Rufus's in SF4.
[3:41:46] <BigYanno> I actually agree with the greed of going for extra hits when he changes phases. The damage you take is worth it
[3:41:48] <floralkami> they are a VERY vocal minority
[3:41:48] <%nip_nips> YOUR FOX EARS ARE NOT ACCURATE TO YOUR REAL EARS
[3:41:49] <+Hilleltaco> But the fox ears are
[3:41:50] <leinadtonu> huehue
[3:41:51] <PinoProxie> paige why aren't your ears on model?
[3:41:52] <+nial_evol> creepos DansGame
[3:41:52] <Sartastic> ew
[3:41:55] <+Axellogic> some of those comments are a bit....
[3:41:57] <yukichocomilk> why are people so stupid
[3:41:57] <klooswep> "I had a nightmare where your boobs showed up outside my house with a knife"
[3:41:57] <slimetus_ultima> PPL are weird
[3:41:58] <Dunmarkh> I should send some messages to crank that shit up
[3:41:58] <RagnarokAM> Sounds like they just want to see your boobs period
[3:41:58] <+goose_attack_almanac> thats a weird thing to say
[3:41:59] <BoxNavy> paiges anatomically accurate fox ears
[3:42:00] <hairtoday> but big tiddy scary
[3:42:05] <albret__einstrong> turn up jiggle to homer simpson bell level
[3:42:06] <mrtanaka111> can you put like a tail on your forehead?
[3:42:06] <derap41> Isn't the point of Vtubers that you can be anything
[3:42:06] <%vVAstrAVv> maybe its just the lighting of them
[3:42:08] <%ElkRiverDog> I'm going to be real: I was staring at the pearls
[3:42:10] <%baronblank> people are being weird, your avatar looks great
[3:42:10] <%CzeekyTV> People are overly hung up on booba for dumb reasons
[3:42:13] <%Agami23> god i hate people. just let people have fun with vtubes
[3:42:14] <%king_wragles> They're in the credits at the bottom of the page!
[3:42:14] <+RickyJZ> Okay that's weird. Those people need to get thicker skin LUL
[3:42:15] <+wolfofsound> Paige is cool but I can't imagine caring that much about a style choice
[3:42:16] <rekinom> are the fox ears accurate to you in real life?
[3:42:17] <slimetus_ultima> dubs to whisper
[3:42:17] <%RayReborne> Anime tiddies are the most controversial Subject Kappa
[3:42:18] <Hydrapissed> GIGA spice
[3:42:20] <mr_saturday93> I've seen ya in a bikini on IG your bewbs are average
[3:42:20] <+Sendrak70> Honker bondanka kazongers
[3:42:22] <cache_22> Too spicy for Twitch
[3:42:22] <%Estuko> Such cry babies but if it makes life easier for page then I'm sticking on the boat ride regardless
[3:42:22] <FrankBlarghHonk> Hello! I am a 1 man Raid! I have the Wraith Bell from Dead by Daylight!! FEAR ME!
[3:42:22] <weissguard> psaBig SPICE
[3:42:24] <$TheRustedKnight> Why would anyone care about if they matched your actual size? BOOBA IS BOOBA
[3:42:24] <markdreizehn> It's kind of creepy that folks think they have the right to tell you how big or small your avatars boobs can be. Like they have ownership of it
[3:42:25] <+bustahwuulf> spicy my fav color
[3:42:25] <Jetsfantasy> "I'm addicted to porn, you have to change your presentation style." and blah blah blah
[3:42:25] <%EyeFarted> @PeachSaliva Have you tried setting jiggle to max just to see what happens
[3:42:25] <Mundkipz> is his art sonic spicy?
[3:42:26] <pretendofriendo> "the boobs are unrealistic" SHE HAS FOX EARS!!!
[3:42:29] <floralkami> yeah, fuck them kids!
[3:42:33] <+TopTieramisu> why does someone expect an animated avatar to be exactly accurate to a real person?
[3:42:35] <albret__einstrong> turn up jiggle to hamer simpson belly lrvrl
[3:42:35] <+polothegreatest> why not watch game instead OSFrog
[3:42:36] <%vVAstrAVv> but like you barely have them on screen ppl gotta grow up
[3:42:41] <%Rumbutt> "Your model design is too boring but also not accurate to your real life body to the milimeter WAAAAA!!!"
[3:42:42] <BigYanno> I would hope no under 18's are here given the number of times she's screamed cunt this stream
[3:42:44] <%nip_nips> you're showing BARE SHOULDER though, very scandalous
[3:42:46] <PhantonBat> So Vtubing is just porn
[3:42:47] <Jetsfantasy> Sweater puppies are based anyways
[3:42:47] <+the22cstomp> paige you dont have fox ears irl >:(
[3:42:50] <%Psych_man13_13> I’ll admit, I didn’t care for the vtube at first but it’s grown on me
[3:42:53] <%Bane_Kaikyo> Can confirm: WFN does spicy work but it's pretty good
[3:42:56] <+JellyAndKake> It's not on you but will just be weird when the prons start getting made
[3:42:56] <Quilltaz> Each of paige’s boobs are just two contained kirbys armed woth switchblades, if they got any bigger they would break free and start stabbing all of us, scp lore right here
[3:42:57] <klooswep> Your model is so unrealistic, no one has hair that good looking Kappa
[3:42:59] <%BlowFireThroatTotem> why do you hate this guy paige?
[3:43:02] <mr_saturday93> her bewbs aren't even intimidating
[3:43:08] <leinadtonu> maybe some people just fear the idea of boobs
[3:43:14] <Kingjoker310> but big booba is actually scary paige
[3:43:17] <AVkid_> @floralkami. no, dont fuck kids. thats 4 laps and a ban
[3:43:21] <pretendofriendo> shes saving the fox ears for marriage
[3:43:26] <%CzeekyTV> Randos hate any boob that they can't touch
[3:43:39] <Hydrapissed> same hp erry time
[3:43:40] <%nip_nips> boss say NO DRINK
[3:43:42] <PhiloRobo> idk y u gotta add more vtubers to my follow list paige
[3:43:42] <rudiciuscaesar> that was just bad luck
[3:43:43] <derap41> Really is the battle of the Bonks
[3:43:44] <%grapplingwithdepression> i was CLENCHED that time
[3:43:46] <%BlowFireThroatTotem> big booba makes me wake up in a cold sweat
[3:43:46] <scrumbotime> paige, the balls go in the ass
[3:43:48] <albret__einstrong> your model is fake, you don't even have real cat ears
[3:43:48] <slimetus_ultima> drinkies? DENIED
[3:43:51] <%Zerenis> barrOof
[3:43:53] <CalderGaming> NotLikeThis
[3:43:58] <leinadtonu> I don't get it tho, boobs rule
[3:43:59] <SilverFaustX> dont drink so close to him
[3:44:03] <%Rumbutt> If you take a hit and get up, you need to wait until he swings and you dodge before taking a drink
[3:44:04] <+Epic_Fubar> damn, thought you had it that time
[3:44:09] <mrtanaka111> whats a hentai?

[3:44:17] <scrumbotime> Who could be angry about a boner?
[3:44:17] <%ItsRatman> Hentai? I would never!
[3:44:18] <pretendofriendo> hentia for the BEST GUY
[3:44:18] <+TheShal> Why would you get angry over a boner? Be excited!
[3:44:19] <Jetsfantasy> That's just puberty

[3:44:26] <%BlowFireThroatTotem> Damn this boner rgtNo rgtNo rgtNo
[3:44:28] <derap41> @mrtanaka111 Its Art is what I learned from TV
[3:44:29] <%Estuko> it's people who never interacted with a women and just panic angrily in reaction.
[3:44:30] <AVkid_> im angry about my boner lmao
[3:44:30] <floralkami> why be angry about boner???
[3:44:31] <TheAngryArtist> big upset boner
[3:44:32] <hairtoday> holy shit, that's awesome
[3:44:32] <mr_saturday93> I think you should call Pat for sexual energy and advice
[3:44:35] <weissguard> That's rad
[3:44:35] <%nip_nips> anger comes from boners
[3:44:38] <BinaryBetrayer> I wanna hear more about that fun fact.
[3:44:41] <zenith0111> Silence wench! I no longer wish to be horny. I just want to be happy hocOoonoo
[3:44:41] <Jetsfantasy> I'd kill for a Golden Girls D&D adaptation
[3:44:41] <%TECHNO_OUTLAW> is that what happens when you see a xray
[3:44:47] <Coystick> I pride myself on being able to identify at a glance the differences between anime and hentai screencaps.
[3:44:50] <+FingaLights> Cause they now got a BONE to pick
[3:44:50] <floralkami> why would you ever be angry about your boner???
[3:44:56] <%baronblank> there's one tweet about it so little info unfortunately afaik
[3:44:57] <FrankBlarghHonk> @PeachSaliva Hello! I just did my second ever stream! You and others I watch have inspired me to start streaming! All I have been streaming is Dead by Daylight!
[3:44:58] <leinadtonu> They are the four humors, right?
[3:45:03] <%BlowFireThroatTotem> but you have to get me thinking about boners, Paige? now I'm pissed
[3:45:04] <+polothegreatest> *guts theme plays in the background*
[3:45:04] <%Sotetsu> You can do it, Paaaaige
[3:45:04] <Quilltaz> Curse thee mine erection, I despise thee for rrrrrrising at the sight of every animated woman upon twitche!!!
[3:45:07] <Hydrapissed> ELEVATOR time
[3:45:10] <%EyeFarted> bLANCH IS THE BARD
[3:45:10] <BoxNavy> oh nooo
[3:45:15] <Kingjoker310> theres not enough hentai for me to feel the horny
[3:45:16] <dr_sweets> I think it was based on personalities, actually
[3:45:17] <%PhiloRobo> PhiloRobo subscribed at Tier 1. 
[3:45:22] <mrtanaka111> to be fair that guy was mentally ill
[3:45:23] <floralkami> LUL I remember that
[3:45:26] <%Sotetsu> Wait, who sued someone over their boner?
[3:45:29] <dr_sweets> But Blanche is the bard 100%
[3:45:33] <Hydrapissed> mall cop
[3:45:48] <Maids4lyfe> someone sued disney for a boner or something
[3:45:49] <Jetsfantasy> Sophia would be the bard, cause she's always horny
[3:45:51] <+Quack_of_Dawn> So much boner that it is illegal
[3:45:53] <BinaryBetrayer> "That was the plan, to give a boner. And you got one"
[3:45:56] <leinadtonu> which ninja turtle would each golden girl be?
[3:45:58] <Jetsfantasy> Blanche, I mean
[3:45:59] <floralkami> @sotetsu tried, they filled 2 lawsuits, both thrown out
[3:46:02] <hairtoday> there was probably a fight over who gets to be bard
[3:46:10] <%LysdexicAndVolingit> Typical adventuring party those days was fighter, cleric, thief/rogue, and wizard
[3:46:12] <Hydrapissed> LOL!1

[3:58:14] <$Sphincter_Spelunker> you aint got no leg lt dan
[3:58:15] <+FingaLights> He aint even got any legs
[3:58:16] <%JenovasPuppet> He killed FITTY MEN
[3:58:17] <+doc_ock_rokc> This man BURNED HIMSELF ALIVE to save the world because he wanted to
[3:58:20] <%Rumbutt> no Peach, HE sacrificed his legs to link the fire
[3:58:20] <mrtanaka111> pats wrong
[3:58:24] <%SveriSageAdvice> basically he didnt get big enough with souls, so he lost his legs
[3:58:25] <derap41> He has no intention of escape....because he can't fucking walk
[3:58:28] <Armadelus> Lieutenant Dan ain't got no legs
[3:58:40] <BoxNavy> the gods suck
[3:58:42] <+doc_ock_rokc> That man ain't no bitch but he has no legs
[3:58:43] <Mr_JustinJones> Got his legs beat like Rick james
[3:58:58] <+TopTieramisu> Late Stage Capitalism, the game franchise
[3:59:01] <derap41> and human sacrifice remember human sacrifices
[3:59:04] <Wiiplayah43> @mrtanaka111 nope he's actually right this time
[3:59:21] <mrtanaka111> @Wiiplayah43 no way
[3:59:24] <%nip_nips> yuria wants you to STEAL the fire
[3:59:24] <Woodywoo0100> How does this differ from the lord of dark stuff?
[3:59:25] <Wiiplayah43> @toptieramisu that's impressive projection
[3:59:34] <peachy996> That world sounds like trash tbh
[3:59:35] <+Reyvierno> Yuria wants humans to have the flame
[3:59:39] <Coystick> Make Londor Great Again!
[3:59:41] <%CantWalkGood> dark stalker kaathe
[3:59:45] <%ItsRatman> But how do we get the Waterworld ending
[3:59:49] <+TopTieramisu> @Wiiplayah43 offended?
[3:59:55] <+FingaLights> There isn't anything about that sentence I don't love
[3:59:57] <BoxNavy> just let this world die moon2W
[3:59:57] <mrtanaka111> anarchist or centrist
[3:59:58] <+doc_ock_rokc> @PeachSaliva The Dark is humanity. The age of dark with flame is the age of humanity and not the gods
[3:59:59] <Tahzani> World is pretty awful as it is, oblivion might not be that bad
[4:00:03] <Wiiplayah43> @toptieramisu not really
[4:00:03] <SilverFaustX> LORE
[4:00:04] <+Reyvierno> Keep God flame, give flames to human, or get rid of flame
[4:00:12] <+TopTieramisu> @Wiiplayah43 k
[4:00:12] <pretendofriendo> HELP A WEIRD GIRL PAINT A NEW WORLD MADE OF SADNESS
[4:00:15] <%FacetiousAF> ??
[4:00:15] <leinadtonu> which ending leads to kingdom hearts tho?
[4:00:17] <rosemon5001> marriage ending is hard to do for her i think
[4:00:18] <TheEndlessRiver1> you now can do all ending options, hurraaaaay
[4:00:20] <%JenovasPuppet> Dragon Armor
[4:00:22] <DancesWitBalrog> Firekeeper path is the best i think
[4:00:22] <%Agami23> age of flame, age of dark, age of man basically
[4:00:36] <%vVAstrAVv> ye
[4:00:37] <BigYanno> the world without flame is the natural state that the world should be in right now
[4:00:38] <+doc_ock_rokc> So just you?
[4:00:43] <%nip_nips> gonna be a while before another bonfire
[4:00:47] <Wiiplayah43> @mrtanaka111 I assume you're talking about Pat's lore explanation
[4:00:50] <%JenovasPuppet> The next bonfire is extremely hidden
[4:00:51] <%Rumbutt> Firekeeper path also has the super secret fourth ending
[4:00:53] <TheEndlessRiver1> good luck, long time before bonfire
[4:00:57] <+doc_ock_rokc> @BigYanno The flame is a cycle the world without flame is the world of dragons
[4:00:59] <%FacetiousAF> my feelings on the next bit wax and wane
[4:01:02] <%patriotrenegade> How’d you like Dragobslayer Armor?
[4:01:05] <pretendofriendo> Usurp the FLAME AND TAKE IT AS Thy own ashen one!
[4:01:09] <DancesWitBalrog> @Rumbutt i hate that one D:
[4:01:10] <derap41> @BigYanno The "natural" state is a state of change not fire not dark
[4:01:18] <Monkeyweed21> Ludleth got to Untended Graves, saw the dark, and Linked the Flame himself in order to sustain this version of Firelink Shrine, so the Unkindled could go travel and get the other Lords of Cinder. He is the only reason the Age of Fire is still going
[4:01:19] <presidentpun> You can do it PAIGE
[4:01:23] <%JenovasPuppet> How they expect new players to make this run is beyond me.
[4:01:24] <presidentpun> I BELIEVE
[4:01:27] <cooldude69xx> Literally one item between these bonfires
[4:01:33] <BoxNavy> so, no one in this history of this games universe has ever tried something other than the age of fire/dark shit? thats kinda funny
[4:01:34] <Dunmarkh> LUL
[4:01:43] <mrtanaka111> @BoxNavy we dont know
[4:01:43] <%Agami23> want something weird? look closely at the face of the body holding that item
[4:01:45] <Tahzani> Ooh this part is so fun
[4:01:48] <$Sphincter_Spelunker> @BoxNavy time is convoluted
[4:01:49] <SilverFaustX> that still bothers me, why so close
[4:01:52] <Wiiplayah43> @toptieramisu was just pointing out a fact, is all.
[4:01:54] <TheEndlessRiver1> it looks like at some point they made the decision for every boss to make a bonfire, so some of them are VERY close because they didnt really mess with those already in place
[4:01:55] <TheAngryArtist> all these nerds pretending to understand DS lore. that shit is nonsense.
[4:01:59] <Dunmarkh> what the fuck is this level design
[4:02:03] <derap41> @BoxNavy Stone Dragons had age of Ancients where nothing happened ever. until something did
[4:02:03] <+TopTieramisu> @Wiiplayah43 are you still talking about that?
[4:02:08] <BigYanno> people have been confused by the fact that there are literally 2 bonfires in sight of each other since day 1
[4:02:10] <%Agami23> yeah i know right?
[4:02:11] <%FacetiousAF> ??
[4:02:12] <%patriotrenegade> That key won’t be here if you don’t kill Oceiros
[4:02:12] <rudiciuscaesar> what face?
[4:02:16] <Kalcom> he's tired
[4:02:17] <+FingaLights> A Blinking
[4:02:19] <%nip_nips> hes resting
[4:02:19] <+Quack_of_Dawn> Uh oh we made an oopsie
[4:02:19] <BinaryBetrayer> Hey remember when this game was originally about killing the 4 dark lords?

[4:05:21] <+doc_ock_rokc> @Monkeyweed21 The theory goes that Champion Gundere or however you spell it was suppoed to link the flame but the ashen one stopped him due to dark time shinanigans Which lead to ludric to step in and create the time that the ashenone came from
[4:05:29] <%Cafe_Spider> and the furtive Ludric, so easily forgotten

[4:07:12] <Dunmarkh> damn hands and their 0 damage attacks, run from them
[4:07:16] <Monkeyweed21> @doc_ock_rokc yea thats super possible, although the main issue is that in the "original" timeline the bell of awakening didn't ring until it was already too late, hence Ludleth's plan involving time traveling
[4:07:28] <%PhiloRobo> Yeah Dark Soul doesn't like poke out any eye holes or nothing huh
[4:07:29] <+Quack_of_Dawn> Ghosts can't hurt you if your head's covered in wax

[4:08:34] <cache_22> "Book Bowels" is a thing?

[4:08:45] <+I4gotmyname89> yes
[4:08:45] <SilverFaustX> @PeachSaliva The Mariko Aoki phenomenon
[4:08:49] <pretendofriendo> The Mariko Aoki phenomenon (青木まりこ現象, Aoki Mariko genshō) is a Japanese expression referring to an urge to defecate that is suddenly felt after entering bookstores.
[4:08:52] <+Dives__> Soooo waxy
[4:08:52] <Dave_VD> I love that bookstore smell so much and I'm glad it doesn't make me shit
[4:08:52] <%ItsRatman> Keep applying that vaseline
[4:08:55] <Jetsfantasy> Chat, it's called the Mariko Aoki phenomenon
[4:08:55] <presidentpun> Isn't it amazing how much paige is better at these games than woolie despite having literal brain damage
[4:08:56] <%JenovasPuppet> Dunk the ass
[4:09:00] <%Maids4lyfe> The Mariko Aoki phenomenon (青木まりこ現象, Aoki Mariko genshō) is a Japanese expression referring to an urge to defecate that is suddenly felt after entering bookstores.
[4:09:01] <rudiciuscaesar> is that Pat in person, if so, hi patttttt

[4:09:13] <SilverFaustX> never stop being japan
[4:09:16] <TheEndlessRiver1> the hands hurt you if you're not waxed
[4:09:17] <+doc_ock_rokc> @PeachSaliva Knowledge is power, Power is energy, Energy is matter, Matter is mass, Mass produces gravity, This pulls your shit out
[4:09:18] <%PhiloRobo> So these are those Yaoi Hands???
[4:09:18] <%patriotrenegade> no go to the right
[4:09:23] <Profmcstevie> Right in the self help aisle

[4:09:28] <%JenovasPuppet> Perhaps the GIANT STAIRS?
[4:09:29] <%Bt_Robot> UP STAIRS
[4:09:31] <+FingaLights> Is that why people have books and magazines in bathrooms???
[4:09:33] <%Zerenis> Doesn’t Japan sell panties in vending machines?

[4:09:47] <maxpasta> which Dewey decimal number is the toilet?
[4:09:50] <VritraReiRei> should we let her figure it out on her own or tell her what the wax does? 🤔
[4:09:50] <SpaceCapnCrone> that phenomenon explains why an arm just like those comes out of a toilet in Majora's Mask.
[4:09:55] <Jetsfantasy> You'd think with the wax on she couldn't get more blind

[4:23:54] <+wolfofsound> the only estate I want to get real about is mr. bucket's mouth
[4:23:59] <$Sphincter_Spelunker> @PeachSaliva someone said you and pat playing video games to pay expenses is inspiring
[4:24:01] <PhantonBat> The fact that vidya games pay for the sex dungeon
[4:24:16] <%patriotrenegade> Love the noises of Pat washing dishes in the background
[4:24:18] <%JenovasPuppet> You ever watch that Mr. Bucket commercial that makes you poop your pants? Look it up, it's a real thing.
[4:24:28] <@SoFarFetched> Remember playing video games bought the house he fucks Paige in Kappa

[4:24:43] <%nip_nips> does he need a step stool to wash the dishes?
[4:24:48] <%FacetiousAF> that's some husband material Kappa
[4:24:51] <Jetsfantasy> He didn't mute his mic LUL

[4:24:52] <%Bt_Robot> WATER ON THE KNEE, BROKEN FUNNY BONE, THOSE AREN'T REAL CONDITIONS

[4:25:46] <%Sotetsu> All that clown porn
[4:25:56] <%Ranryu692> Pat just starts reading all of his credit card numbers aloud
[4:25:59] <pretendofriendo> time to do the WEIRD GROSS THING
[4:26:04] <PhantonBat> The secret porn, the most powerful porn
[4:26:11] <floralkami> you could make a beat out of PatWashingDishes. wav
[4:26:14] <%Grimlockfly> THE SECRET PORN IS THE BEST PORN
[4:26:15] <%patriotrenegade> Cant wait for the housing bubble to burst so I can buy my own home
[4:26:17] <+FingaLights> @Sotetsu it's amazing all the shapes they make
[4:26:18] <rudiciuscaesar> is it even more strange in Quebec?
[4:26:24] <%Reaped_Psyche> Can't have you finding him wacking it to his secret normie porn.
[4:26:30] <+wolfofsound> It's a sellers market that's for sure
[4:26:31] <%PhiloRobo> Love these little witch goblins.
[4:26:31] <RagnarokAM> Everyone wants to be a BnB and it fucked all the prices
[4:26:32] <rudiciuscaesar> cuz they have so much autonomy
[4:26:36] <%ZephynM> That is way more flasks than I what I had at that point in the game.
[4:26:40] <%Sotetsu> @fingalights otzKEK
[4:26:43] <Dave_VD> I figured that it's a result of people trying to emmigrate/immigrate there
[4:26:44] <BinaryBetrayer> We're moving to a world where nobody owns houses and instead rents them to large investing conglomerates
[4:27:05] <+wolfofsound> LUL
[4:27:11] <%nip_nips> nobody wants to live near them
[4:27:11] <$Sphincter_Spelunker> no one wants french neighbors
[4:27:20] <%Draylle> not even the French?
[4:27:25] <+Reyvierno> Stinky
[4:27:25] <rudiciuscaesar> I'm just curious cuz states with more autonomy have a worst housing market, at least in my state.
[4:27:28] <floralkami> guys, we all know the secret porn is just moderately clothed women in tiny hats
[4:27:29] <vonmaultke> Time to be become French
[4:27:31] <%patriotrenegade> I fire my gun in the air a couple times every few weeks to keep the rent low
[4:27:32] <%Dakuu75> but, I love the smell of Baguettes
[4:27:38] <+TopTieramisu> lucky for you guys
[4:27:38] <%TheWinged7> and they are all je suis fatigue
[4:27:42] <+TopTieramisu> that's not a factor
[4:27:42] <Monkeyweed21> WALL
[4:27:42] <Jetsfantasy> There's a stereotype against the french? What? No! I could never imagine that... D:
[4:27:44] <%Sotetsu> Just have everyone speak English. sipsipHellmo
[4:27:46] <fluffy_sauce> the wall!
[4:27:50] <mrtanaka111> so the meta is having a french in every house for cheaper rent
[4:27:58] <%patriotrenegade> illusory wall upstairs

[4:41:54] <%CantWalkGood> its a good game, but if you don't like parrying you'll hate it
[4:42:10] <%luckypineapple> This entire section is basically a DES reference
[4:42:11] <Vaardvark> "they're a demons souls reference" you can literally say that about every single thing in this game and it would be true
[4:42:11] <TheAngryArtist> @sphincter_spelunker weird. i beat it like 4 times and still wanna play it again.
[4:42:23] <%luckypineapple> I forget has paige played DES yet?
[4:42:23] <Kalcom> paige has never parried a boss
[4:42:29] <Wiiplayah43> I don't remember those at all, you sure?
[4:42:33] <PhantonBat> Has Paige done Demon's Souls yet?
[4:42:43] <%TheWinged7> pew pew
[4:42:45] <%patriotrenegade> The spellcaster is the lady who invades you in the Untended Graves, Lion Knight Albert is a summonable for Vordt and the Black Hand guy is Gotthardt's apprentice
[4:42:47] <%MetroidSlayerP7> I hate parry so much I re-edited Friends so that Chandler wasn't in the show
[4:42:49] <%nip_nips> paige does not parry, she unga bunga
[4:42:49] <Monkeyweed21> dont let them splash you with cum
[4:42:58] <+Mekhet09> @PeachSaliva the problem with sekiro is that you need to parry everything.
[4:43:00] <Wiiplayah43> @vaardvark not even close. Dark Souls, yes, but not Demon's Souls
[4:43:11] <+lordericter> PARTY TIME
[4:43:20] <%luckypineapple> i remember this was the level i ended up giving up on DS3
[4:43:23] <%JenovasPuppet> You can lure one, sort of
[4:43:25] <TheAngryArtist> i hate these asshole npcs
[4:43:28] <+FingaLights> Crazy talk?
[4:43:29] <%nip_nips> @Wiiplayah43 like half the game is a des reference

[4:43:59] <%vVAstrAVv> ITEMMM
[4:44:01] <Dave_VD> It sounds like we can all agree that Paige is gonna skip Sekiro and that's rad in its own way. That leaves room for a Mass Effect playthrough

[4:44:07] <$Sphincter_Spelunker> this guy's got his spacing down
[4:44:10] <%TheWinged7> 2

[4:46:45] <+FingaLights> Teleport to it
[4:46:46] <acexclover> kind of weird bonfire placement huh
[4:46:50] <weissguard> nintHeart
[4:46:54] <TheDewdHole> @Dave_VD gives Perseverance, so she'd get super tanky for a few swings
[4:46:55] <%nip_nips> they are happy together?
[4:47:02] <+Sendrak70> Maybe they are just siblings?
[4:47:10] <%vVAstrAVv> yeah they were dumb with bonfires in this one
[4:47:14] <albret__einstrong> what if they seduce pat?
[4:47:15] <$Sphincter_Spelunker> "roommates" KappaPride
[4:47:18] <yourliteraldog> Pat might seduce them cus he such an alpha
[4:47:20] <mr_saturday93> But Pats raw sexual energy might attract them. (would on me)
[4:47:48] <%nip_nips> what if pat seduces THEM?
[4:47:49] <+polothegreatest> dont you mean "cousins"? LUL
[4:47:53] <Dave_VD> @TheDewdHole Oh cool is that like super armor? I might have to give this weapon a shot next time I play this game
[4:47:53] <acexclover> alot of your stats page they set me off they arent even sylvsDead

[4:48:42] <%Rumbutt> STOP
[4:48:44] <BoxNavy> elevadurr
[4:48:50] <TheDewdHole> @Dave_VD yup. poise functions oddly in this game but it can be very fun. i recommend
[4:48:51] <RushUnplugged> @Dave_VD most big weapons totally have super-armor (so much for "poise doesn't work") and their special skill increases it. you can just swing through hits
[4:48:52] <%vVAstrAVv> pat. u go so her brain turn on
[4:48:58] <+xerotwo> LUL
[4:48:59] <Ner234> She's TRYING

[4:49:10] <%patriotrenegade> @PeachSaliva go
[4:49:12] <%patriotrenegade> left
[4:49:20] <%baronblank> remember pat is slightly behind on your stream paige

[4:49:34] <albret__einstrong> vtuber artist forgot to rig brains

[4:49:42] <BigYanno> up is your friend
[4:49:45] <rosemon5001> you should check out the golden pats
[4:49:47] <%JenovasPuppet> Oh yeah, did that bone shard ever get burnt?
[4:49:48] <+lordericter> why would anything bad happen on a bridge
[4:49:56] <blue8moon> kick their butts!
[4:49:58] <penitentpendant> It's not the most inspiring line of defense
[4:50:00] <+lordericter> RUN
[4:50:00] <%nip_nips> nothing bad ever happens on bridges in dark souls
[4:50:02] <penitentpendant> But they're tryin'
[4:50:06] <Dave_VD> @TheDewdHole @RushUnplugged That's rad
[4:50:10] <%MetroidSlayerP7> skeleton warriors
[4:50:17] <$Sphincter_Spelunker> gamers and bridges, name a more iconic duo
[4:50:19] <%ElkRiverDog> What is it with Souls games and bridge ambushes, any?
[4:50:24] <Wiiplayah43> HUGE DeS reference here
[4:50:47] <yourliteraldog> Rember when COD always had ya blow up a nazi bridge
[4:50:58] <%CzeekyTV> oh yeah, red eye knight on a bridge
[4:51:05] <Monkeyweed21> @PeachSaliva there is an estus shard if you go up the other stairs

[4:51:42] <MrPolarBearCub> BIG BOI ITEM

[4:52:05] <$Sphincter_Spelunker> twofer
[4:52:09] <%JenovasPuppet> Good job, hammer
[4:52:09] <%Sotetsu> Geeze, so strong
[4:52:11] <albret__einstrong> If they want you to link the fire, why do they try so hard to stop you
[4:52:13] <%Bt_Robot> SHE'S TRAVELLING AT THE SPEED OF LIGHT
[4:52:14] <shinyruo8> WutFace

[4:52:18] <+bunchaghosts> hell yeah
[4:52:23] <%Rumbutt> turn right
[4:52:24] <%MetroidSlayerP7> I'm a fan of the Lothric Knight armor set. it's pretty okay.
[4:52:34] <MrPolarBearCub> Watching her literally power house through those makes me sad lol
[4:52:34] <weissguard> Pat struggled with that in the LP, btw
[4:52:36] <+FingaLights> Pat is on delay
[4:52:41] <%JenovasPuppet> There's a delay, Pat!
[4:52:42] <MrPolarBearCub> That was so dang easy lol
[4:52:46] <cache_22> The delay of Pat's instructions is comical.
[4:52:53] <sirrice77> i didn't know about this elevator for the longest time
[4:52:56] <penitentpendant> Fun Fact: I beat my first run of this game never finding THIS elevator
[4:52:59] <%JenovasPuppet> It's a tough run!
[4:52:59] <BigYanno> but pat wasn't HUGE
[4:53:00] <%nip_nips> pat struggles with easy stuff
[4:53:01] <$Sphincter_Spelunker> be sure to thank Hammer
[4:53:01] <wolfen091> so it seems they fixed the poise bug to where it works now
[4:53:02] <+lordericter> It seems like they nerfed the bridge
[4:53:03] <+polothegreatest> sipsipDab sipsipDab sipsipDab
[4:53:06] <%PhiloRobo> BORK
[4:53:07] <Dave_VD> "Tch"

[4:53:13] <Jaysky> @penitentpendant I found it out after I beat the boss
[4:53:13] <Monkeyweed21> @PeachSaliva pat got lost on a staircase for 30 minutes in the LP
[4:53:16] <+DeaconBluesClues> nerd who is bad at video games
[4:53:16] <peachy996> Oh come on Pat that was still a chunky build
[4:53:19] <RushUnplugged> Pat you had the pre-nerf Estoc
[4:53:21] <BoxNavy> ARF ARF

[4:54:12] <%Bt_Robot> sipsipSipsipblind sipsipSipsipblind sipsipSipsipblind
[4:54:13] <MrPolarBearCub> Literally go straight lol
[4:54:16] <%Bane_Kaikyo> *looks at bossroom* No that's not it
[4:54:18] <BigYanno> You spent like 3 hours fighting the boss hete
[4:54:20] <%nip_nips> shes not full on estus
[4:54:29] <%TheWinged7> !uptime
[4:54:33] <+doc_ock_rokc> yee
[4:54:40] <$Sphincter_Spelunker> uptime is next to the view count
[4:54:40] <Monkeyweed21> @PeachSaliva the final estus shard is on the roof of the archives
[4:54:45] <MrPolarBearCub> Pat the liar
[4:54:46] <%patriotrenegade> Well the base game
[4:54:47] <%Agami23> theres no more zones.
[4:54:47] <%JenovasPuppet> Assuming no optional areas or DLC.
[4:54:50] <penitentpendant> Skipping the DLC?
[4:54:50] <rosemon5001> she should still get it to meet the golden boys
[4:54:50] <Monkeyweed21> She still has Dragon Peak
[4:54:56] <+the22cstomp> dlc?
[4:54:58] <MrPolarBearCub> Ehhh
[4:54:58] <Coystick> Dee Ell Ceeee
[4:55:03] <+NateyBeak> dlc??
[4:55:04] <+Gouf_Troop> dlc
[4:55:05] <%vVAstrAVv> nameless?
[4:55:07] <Jaysky> Eh, she's better off doing the DLC Pat
[4:55:13] <%Draylle> this is going a lot smoother than DS2, maybe its the frequent streaming
[4:55:13] <+DragonArt07> DLC?
[4:55:15] <BoxNavy> she can do last boss and dlc and NK the next couple streams
[4:55:15] <MrPolarBearCub> Benadryl lol
[4:55:18] <+DeaconBluesClues> dlc, also arch dragon peak area
[4:55:20] <%nip_nips> she can do dlc after final boss
[4:55:23] <BigYanno> dlc AFTER fibal boss
[4:55:24] <%Dakuu75> DUDE! she can't ACTUALLY beat it... (I'm not ready for this)
[4:55:25] <%EyeFarted> SAD MUSIC'
[4:55:25] <xbb1024> but that's how you exchange darkness within you
[4:55:25] <RagnarokAM> No folks, DLC before Final Boss would make the Final Boss WAY TOO EASY
[4:55:29] <%MetroidSlayerP7> fire keeper was like "why are you holding my hand?!"
[4:55:31] <DianaTheAscian> she can do dlc after
[4:55:31] <+cubbywolf> ew pats voice
[4:55:33] <penitentpendant> Paranoia leftover from DS2
[4:55:33] <%Sotetsu> First kill boss
[4:55:34] <Dave_VD> I think he means "beat the game"
[4:55:35] <sirrice77> guys after you beat the final boss it doesn't make you automaticaly goto ng+
[4:55:36] <weissguard> The DLC explicitly takes place beyond the final boss
[4:55:37] <%patriotrenegade> because the final boss is FINAL Kappa
[4:55:40] <+cubbywolf> LUL
[4:55:40] <Jaysky> Cause then she gets colsure
[4:55:41] <mr_saturday93> Super hard!
[4:55:43] <+DeaconBluesClues> thats how I did it
[4:55:43] <TheDewdHole> Slave Knight Gael needs to be the final fight
[4:55:44] <DianaTheAscian> this isn't bloodborne
[4:55:45] <%nip_nips> the final boss is miyazaki
[4:55:45] <%Agami23> paige is going to stomp the final boss, lets be real
[4:55:46] <+RigmaroleHM> Might be confusing with DaS1
[4:55:46] <+cubbywolf> DLC must be played
[4:55:46] <Jaysky> *closure
[4:55:47] <BigYanno> the DLC can be crazy hard
[4:55:49] <penitentpendant> Though at least you're not forced into NG+ in this game
[4:55:49] <+polothegreatest> it is?
[4:55:51] <TheEndlessRiver1> you can do the dlc after the final boss yall
[4:55:52] <%patriotrenegade> For my lore OCD of course!
[4:55:54] <BigYanno> end
[4:55:55] <%SveriSageAdvice> like guys you remember you can fight DLC after final boss right?
[4:55:57] <TheEndlessRiver1> its not a playthrough ender
[4:55:59] <Kalcom> but what if she touches the end game button
[4:56:00] <%Agami23> hell she might stomp the twink and hunk
[4:56:00] <%vVAstrAVv> ds3 doesn't throw u into ng+ its fine
[4:56:02] <TheEndlessRiver1> it wont auto start ng+
[4:56:07] <+DragonArt07> Did she fight the nameless king?
[4:56:07] <Monkeyweed21> wieght
[4:56:07] <MrPolarBearCub> DLC before boss it’s always cannon lol
[4:56:09] <%JenovasPuppet> Big VIG
[4:56:09] <%PhiloRobo> HypeScream
[4:56:19] <+cubbywolf> math
[4:56:19] <+DeaconBluesClues> archdragon before dlc, right?
[4:56:20] <Jaysky> @TheEndlessRiver1 Yep, but if she does the final boss she'll have closure and may never bother depending
[4:56:24] <$Sphincter_Spelunker> HypeShame
[4:56:26] <+Gouf_Troop> nameless king tho pat
[4:56:29] <Monkeyweed21> @DragonArt07 she did not get close to him yet
[4:56:30] <%JenovasPuppet> Do you have another?
[4:56:31] <+DeaconBluesClues> vitality also amps physical defense
[4:56:37] <+RigmaroleHM> About to ResidentSleeper ResidentSleeper
[4:56:41] <BigYanno> NAMELESS KING OF COURSE
[4:56:42] <TheEndlessRiver1> @TheEndlessRiver1 pat will make her
[4:56:50] <+DragonArt07> Wrong bonfire
[4:56:51] <Monkeyweed21> @PeachSaliva you can get the final estus shard on the roof of the archives
[4:56:51] <BigYanno> I forgot about nameless king
[4:56:52] <Wiiplayah43> it's not stupid, you need it to be HUGE
[4:56:52] <TheAntiNihilist> NAMELESS KING
[4:56:56] <MrPolarBearCub> Hey *whistles* commere
[4:57:05] <%PhiloRobo> "Red toy" I think a Kong chew?
[4:57:05] <BigYanno> now Nameless King is a worthy final boss
[4:57:08] <penitentpendant> Warping 5 feet
[4:57:10] <%JenovasPuppet> Pass the controller to Pat and then quietly mumble in a near-sleep state, pretending that you're playing.
[4:57:10] <Monkeyweed21> No use this elevator to get to the roof
[4:57:11] <%Agami23> well i mean its right there
[4:57:11] <rosemon5001> pat can you lead her to the golden boys?
[4:57:13] <%CptCreampuff16> she didnt find greirat? or did she even send him
[4:57:13] <DianaTheAscian> you can do it all after
[4:57:14] <%nip_nips> warping to a bonfire you can see
[4:57:16] <$Sphincter_Spelunker> 1 boss view, you can do it
[4:57:22] <+cubbywolf> you know weed is legal here right?
[4:57:28] <$SvenHolgersson> sweep paige needs her night night juice
[4:57:29] <Monkeyweed21> The final estus shard is literally 10 feet away
[4:57:32] <+Sendrak70> Might as well call it here, that way you dont get frustrated when things start getting too intense.
[4:57:34] <%JenovasPuppet> OH BOY LUL
[4:57:40] <penitentpendant> Eh, seeing the boss's intro is worthwhile
[4:57:40] <%Rumbutt> WRONG WAY
[4:57:41] <$SvenHolgersson> It's amazing
[4:57:43] <cache_22> Oh no...
[4:57:43] <%JenovasPuppet> Teleport back!
