[0:20:26] <%patriotrenegade> BIG DAMAGE
[0:20:26] <aximeck> You got this!
[0:20:27] <devanmuse> Sassy Sussy Baa
[0:20:30] <devanmuse> Baka
[0:20:30] <%king_wragles> You're a bit over geared/leveled for this, but the game is still HARD
[0:20:31] <peachy996> Take a nice nap
[0:20:31] <EuropanLamprey> Lvl 90 is not overleveled
[0:20:33] <SMuffinMan> He was legit being nice
[0:20:33] <+Ne1son> How many rolls can Paige do in the stopped time
[0:20:34] <%femto216> A battle between cripples
[0:20:34] <freelancebabymaker> @peachsaliva this boss can be like fucked hard for some people so just dont freak out if you lose
[0:20:35] <+Axellogic> We never said you were going to do well just that you were very strong
[0:20:35] <+tigerfang86> you can be nice but also sassy
[0:20:38] <TallYoda08> @PatStaresAt True lol
[0:20:38] <+Ralen_Sharr> kinda starts that fight with a cheap shot
[0:20:39] <%AncelDeLambert> I think the suggested level for this boss is the low 90s
[0:20:44] <%AncelDeLambert> SHE IS NOT OVERLEVELED
[0:20:46] <Melchior_the_Wise> does Paige know if they are Traps?
[0:20:49] <@PatStaresAt> @PeachSaliva For real, the best chance to hit him is with your attack out of a roll after one of his big swings
[0:20:50] <peachy996> snicey
[0:20:53] <%Bluwizard21> oh wow she's only 88?
[0:20:55] <oozebear> when this paige hits 88 levels you're gonna see some serious shit
[0:20:56] <%patriotrenegade> Her weapon is just really good
[0:21:02] <%KeiganOfAstora> Yea, your roll attack is really good
[0:21:08] <freelancebabymaker> @PeachSaliva just try and keep a cool head an dont panic
[0:21:11] <Melchior_the_Wise> does that mean you can time travel?
[0:21:13] <%Bluwizard21> well when you only have 3 stats to level
[0:21:15] <Melchior_the_Wise> 88 Levels per hour
[0:21:15] <cache_22> Lorian also hates when you get up in his rear.
[0:21:16] <+mellamoberny> this is a package deal lol
[0:21:20] <DrkJP520> it's been 88 years

[0:21:35] <%ssjklyco> Over leveled or not, Paige evens it out.
[0:21:35] <T_Sasquatch> all these consistent streams in a row damn paige. Good job !
[0:21:40] <AthenaAegis> Here's the strategy: Unga, then Bunga Kappa
[0:21:41] <%JoshManVGH> 88 levels but a lich ain't one.
[0:21:45] <+Aarseth> 8 is the sacred number of Khorne, Blood for the blood god!
[0:21:46] <%KeiganOfAstora> 3?
[0:21:47] <EuropanLamprey> @PatStaresAt You plan on getting the remaining estus shards and bone before the DLCs for her?

[0:23:17] <Monkeyweed21> god this music is amazing
[0:23:17] <%KeiganOfAstora> @PeachSaliva Here's a good tip: use your remaining soul items to buy a shit ton of embers. They give you more HP and having a lot means you don't have to worry about running out. You'll probably only die 5-10 times here and the other few bosses so get 30 and you're good
[0:23:33] <+QueequegTheater> DS3 is so hard that you can dodge 12 times in a row Kappa
[0:23:35] <freelancebabymaker> @KeiganOfAstora honestly yes
[0:23:39] <%MarylandJutsu> all good paige you got this
[0:23:42] <%AncelDeLambert> I don't think she's really used any of her embers anyways up to now, so she probably has a ton
[0:23:43] <ryderbootz> watch out for his Teleportation Takedown move! Its a killer!
[0:23:46] <+TheMadeMember> lock on when he disappears
[0:23:47] <%patriotrenegade> Nothing personal, kid
[0:23:47] <Melchior_the_Wise> @KeiganOfAstora if she's going to do DLC, she's got a long way to go
[0:23:50] <+tigerfang86> HE STOOD UP
[0:23:54] <%KeiganOfAstora> Or someone just invade her and drop her 99 Embers LUL
[0:23:54] <+tigerfang86> for like 2 seconds
[0:23:55] <%vVAstrAVv> paige there is no distance you can make against a teleporter. youre best healing is on oppertunity.
[0:23:59] <freelancebabymaker> she has the fear of cinsumables just like pat does
[0:23:59] <Finakala> You'll need all those embers for Friede
[0:24:02] <%MarylandJutsu> TRICKSTER!

[0:27:14] <%KeiganOfAstora> @cache_22 She can't handle Outer Wilds dude. I asked once lol
[0:27:16] <+QueequegTheater> Play Disco Elysium, it's fully voice acted Kappa
[0:27:18] <Monkeyweed21> you have to do math
[0:27:24] <$Agami23> the game puzzle agent might be more paiges style, it has full voice acting and similar gameplay as layton
[0:27:26] <%MisterRockett> @Bluwizard21 GOD I forgot about that! I wanna watch that now.
[0:27:29] <@SoFarFetched> "on my home from work"
[0:27:31] <%ComfortableStranger> @KeiganOfAstora of course its in space

[0:27:41] <peachy996> Oh you'll get this one
[0:27:42] <@Jekado> You can play Obra Dinn!

[0:27:52] <tictoc_clock> @Dunmarkh thanks for explaining that as I did not know that commercial existed as well also oh god the Fast & Furious Memes with coffee now
[0:27:53] <@Jekado> we'd have to put Obra Dinn in emote mode tho!
[0:27:55] <@SoFarFetched> If she played Obra Dinn chat would be in emote mode LUL
[0:27:59] <freelancebabymaker> @Jekado how would she do with that you think?
[0:28:04] <%KeiganOfAstora> @SoFarFetched Why?
[0:28:10] <@SoFarFetched> @freelancebabymaker she did pretty good when pat was play ing

[0:28:27] <+Kriptin> BibleThump200 Just install two Text To Speech machines in your Vboobs so they can do the talking for you.
[0:28:27] <@MelBrooksKA> @jekado Paaaatuh mode
[0:28:27] <freelancebabymaker> @SoFarFetched was she helping?
[0:28:31] <%AncelDeLambert> Paige was there when Pat played Obra Dinn, there's no secrets left for her
[0:28:33] <mr_saturday93> Hell
[0:28:37] <BoxNavy> do spanish flea on the mouth trumpet
[0:28:37] <@Jekado> @freelancebabymaker She did better then pat in some sections and she likes murder mysteries
[0:28:38] <@SoFarFetched> @KeiganOfAstora its a game that you can ONLY play once,because theres only one answer to things.
[0:28:41] <%SuckerPunchSyd> @keiganofastora its a cool puzzle game
[0:28:44] <%AncelDeLambert> that first twenty minutes is the biggest pop-off of Obra Dinn, you can't get it back
[0:28:44] <%patriotrenegade> I ran out of ice cubes, so I'm using frozen pizza rolls rn
[0:28:44] <+realm_forge> I wonder if I could make Vort’s Hammer out of foam
[0:28:45] <Monkeyweed21> asking patuh
[0:28:50] <+ikantreeed> ola
[0:28:58] <Vithaeria> I like that she has played 3 DS games probably with the chat spamming her about the "elevator trick" and she still needs to be reminded. I'm not picking on her, i really enjoy it
[0:29:11] <+Dives__> Patty? Cute
[0:29:13] <Monkeyweed21> Aldritch

[0:29:19] <Melchior_the_Wise> Orb is too distracting
[0:29:19] <peachy996> light show no hit
[0:29:19] <%nip_nips> light show = no fight, just dodge
[0:29:23] <Monkeyweed21> think of Aldritch and his arrows
[0:29:23] <+SenorCounter> light show happen = run
[0:29:25] <DrkJP520> keep rollin rollin rollin
[0:29:25] <%patriotrenegade> no

[0:41:29] <%JoshManVGH> Prey Slaughtered!
[0:41:29] <%MechArch> you defeated elevator
[0:41:30] <Marakami_Sadaneo> I was watching pat's RE2 vod and why do you have something against bagels
[0:41:31] <%nip_nips> if you can beat elevator, you can beat anything
[0:41:32] <Melchior_the_Wise> @Ravioli_Ronin you think so?
[0:41:33] <%KeiganOfAstora> Yahtzee
[0:41:35] <@PatStaresAt> @peachsaliva im not 100% but it looks like his overhead swing is always the last hit in his combo. so you can dodge them to the side and swing
[0:41:37] <%sick_kickflips> perhaps the real elevator is the friends we made along the way
[0:41:37] <Valkryna> Lothric has no chance now that you've defeated the elevator
[0:41:41] <+dalmek> the real boss fights were the elevators we took along the way
[0:41:42] <%Sotetsu> That elevator's just trying to get a rise out of you.

[0:44:07] <%sick_kickflips> ooof
[0:44:07] <%ComfortableStranger> RIP
[0:44:08] <benjiFG> this fight is always hell for me cause my R3 button barely works
[0:44:12] <Vithaeria> A trick for phase 2: Focus on avoiding his BIG SWORD rather than the magic, you will avoid both if you do that
[0:44:13] <peachy996> gettin there
[0:44:14] <%AncelDeLambert> Lightshow
[0:44:15] <+loukemia83> Paige wait for the fireworks to stop!

[0:44:34] <%LysdexicAndVolingit> @ZenaiZ About $2k worth of money
[0:44:35] <+thelonechris> Snow cone
[0:44:37] <$hrbeck_> the little brother lays eggs, just like kakyoin

[0:44:42] <BoxNavy> the shame cone
[0:44:42] <%KeiganOfAstora> You can't change Jesus Christ?
[0:44:44] <%ssjklyco> So, my advice that may work for you, is vocally count their attacks like you did when you beat Gwyn and Orphan
[0:44:48] <+Axellogic> Wait you have wind?
[0:44:50] <freelancebabymaker> i feel like you could use some more health
[0:44:50] <ZComiX> when you are on the light show try unlockfrom the boss because you'll start dodging into him after he teleports
[0:44:50] <%NeonLight> LUL

[0:44:56] <%ComfortableStranger> not without plastic surgery
[0:44:57] <%AncelDeLambert> well... you CAN, it just requires surgery
[0:44:59] <Dunmarkh> Wind? You can make them sway in the breeze?
[0:45:02] <%king_wragles> Pat with the helpful advice
[0:45:03] <peachy996> get all up in Lothric's Cone? I think only Lorian can do that
[0:45:05] <artificiallynatural> wind?
[0:45:06] <%GalacticaPhanto> But what if I WANTED TO?
[0:45:07] <%RayReborne> Gear Third them Tiddies
[0:45:08] <+AntithesisEK> the wind could be pushing you just like the dangan
[0:45:10] <+Ne1son> I choose not to believe in the absence of the boob slider

[0:48:00] <%cade_calrayn> Yeah it's the Vitality level she's at, it's enough to tank several of those hits with just a fraction to spare
[0:48:04] <%CubicPhantom> luck is a skill, and you have mastered it

[0:56:33] <%AncelDeLambert> doin' good, doggo
[0:56:36] <T_Sasquatch> i wish fromsoft games had instant restarts at bosses. Boss runs just kill the momentum
[0:56:39] <ToneBacas> oh look, another dogged contender OhMyDog
[0:56:41] <%Gloom_Tangerine> Is there a reason no ember for more health?
[0:56:43] <Broand> hittem with your rhythm stick
[0:56:50] <%SophiaAmoreaVeritas> SeemsGood
[0:56:56] <%patriotrenegade> what if she needs the emebrs for later?
[0:56:56] <benjiFG> bork
[0:56:58] <%nip_nips> @Gloom_Tangerine shes too big and strong for ember
[0:56:59] <BoxNavy> a r f
[0:57:01] <%NeonLight> Fashion souls is the proper way to play
[0:57:02] <peachy996> @T_Sasquatch the closest you have is Maria
[0:57:02] <Marakami_Sadaneo> it's fine
[0:57:03] <ToneBacas> eh
[0:57:05] <%KeiganOfAstora> Ember is good, more HP
[0:57:05] <freelancebabymaker> @Gloom_Tangerine she has SO MANY soul items
[0:57:08] <SomeOtherNeb> do what you want
[0:57:08] <%cade_calrayn> It's not cheating, this is the second-to-last boss
[0:57:09] <$cgreene64> whatever you want to d9
[0:57:10] <BoxNavy> do it up
[0:57:10] <benjiFG> perfectly legit
[0:57:11] <%RayReborne> what no Big ember lol
[0:57:11] <$AmanDotZip> never
[0:57:11] <%Agami23> do it if you want, its a mechanic
[0:57:12] <Monkeyweed21> do it
[0:57:12] <%ssjklyco> Everything is cheating in dark souls
[0:57:13] <TheZearGuy> Go for it
[0:57:13] <%CubicPhantom> who cares about that nonsense, ember if you feel like it
[0:57:13] <penitentpendant> Embering is fine, summoning help is more debatable
[0:57:13] <%sick_kickflips> follow your heart
[0:57:14] <oozebear> if it's a mechanic in the base game it's not cheatibg
[0:57:15] <%AncelDeLambert> who thu FUCK thinks an ember is cheating?
[0:57:17] <%KeiganOfAstora> @PeachSaliva Use your soul items to buy a ton of embers
[0:57:17] <SomeOtherNeb> the bosses cheat, why wouldn't you?
[0:57:18] <%nip_nips> ELEVATOR DOWN
[0:57:18] <%Major_Lee_> D Lords
[0:57:18] <ToneBacas> send it down
[0:57:18] <Zeif00> Honestly do what it takes girl
[0:57:20] <fruit_pie_the_magician> I think technically he embers in phase 2 anyway
[0:57:21] <%cade_calrayn> Ember up if you want, it'll let you tank more!
[0:57:22] <freelancebabymaker> you being embered is literally how you should be
[0:57:22] <%CptCreampuff16> he is embered up
[0:57:22] <%JoshManVGH> But the boss run give you time to reflect on your errors and plan your next approach
[0:57:23] <%vVAstrAVv> ember if you know youve got it
[0:57:23] <Sir_Gawain_Lotsson> Only reason not to use it is if you think you're about to lose 100 times and lose all your embers @PeachSaliva
[0:57:25] <%RayReborne> ember up lol
[0:57:25] <%NeonLight> People think levelling up is cheating
[0:57:29] <+FackinCrazy> Its more like not using them is hard mode
[0:57:31] <%JoshManVGH> Ember like a boss!
[0:57:32] <Marakami_Sadaneo> real cheating is using che@tengine
[0:57:34] <ToneBacas> future Paige will be pissed at you
[0:57:34] <%AncelDeLambert> show me the people who think that's cheating, I have a club for them. With nails in.
[0:57:34] <%patriotrenegade> you might need them later!
[0:57:38] <%KeiganOfAstora> More HP is good for you
[0:57:40] <%Garthunox> using a common game mechanic aint cheating paige, whatever helps you win
[0:57:43] <$Sphincter_Spelunker> Pat definitely cheated then
[0:57:44] <%nip_nips> not beating this boss at level 1 is cheating
[0:57:44] <freelancebabymaker> i also think you might also have like 80 of them
[0:57:45] <%sick_kickflips> you've already lost to the elevator
[0:57:49] <%ssjklyco> You dodged? That's cheating
[0:57:50] <Sir_Gawain_Lotsson> good dodge at start
[0:57:53] <%KeiganOfAstora> People are being tryhards, stop it
[0:57:54] <%cade_calrayn> She has so many embers and Pat will grind for more if she runs out
[0:57:58] <EuropanLamprey> Lvl 1 Deprived with stick or you didn't really play Dark Souls
[0:57:59] <Sir_Gawain_Lotsson> that one was not so great
[0:57:59] <mattynezz> If you haven't done a SL1 run, you haven't played REAL Dark Souls
[0:58:00] <SomeOtherNeb> I have clearly missed a few streams because she's good at dodging now
[0:58:02] <%sick_kickflips> oo direct hit
[0:58:15] <%AncelDeLambert> oh no she's hitting roll when she wants to smack
[0:58:17] <%Maids4lyfe> ease up on the rolling
[0:58:18] <%KeiganOfAstora> @mattynezz Do you believe that seriously?
[0:58:26] <%CubicPhantom> man I always hate the timing on big overhead swings. so rough
[0:58:27] <mattynezz> Obviously not
[0:58:33] <%KeiganOfAstora> Oh ok wasn't sure lol
[0:58:34] <$Sphincter_Spelunker> @KeiganOfAstora its sarcasm my dude
[0:58:36] <%AncelDeLambert> YEYEYEYE
[0:58:42] <%JoshManVGH> What is an SL1 run?
[0:58:45] <%MechArch> you do it
[0:58:46] <%optimasmaximas> i always liked this fights OST
[0:58:47] <%KeiganOfAstora> That one felt plausible LUL
[0:58:47] <mattynezz> Soul Level 1
[0:58:48] <%sick_kickflips> KILL THE FOLGERS TWINKS
[0:58:49] <%nip_nips> clearly they meant sl1 no bonfire no hit no roll
[0:58:50] <%cade_calrayn> the amount of damage Paige does in a hit is strictly obscene
[0:58:52] <T_Sasquatch> @JoshManVGH pain , it is pain
[0:58:53] <Zeif00> That was pretty quick
[0:58:55] <$Sphincter_Spelunker> ugh
[0:58:56] <EuropanLamprey> Lvl 1 isn't enough, you have to be naked and fight with broken straight sword
[0:58:57] <ShinMaddrox> @JoshManVGH Soul level 1. as in never leveling up
[0:58:59] <+Walopoh> Oh....
[0:59:00] <%Urgotfantasy> Mmm, coffee
[0:59:03] <Jaysky> o
[0:59:03] <%CubicPhantom> yeah this violin is killing it
[0:59:04] <%Maids4lyfe> Voght's hammer is insane
[0:59:05] <cache_22> Beware the Foldger's flavor crystalls.
[0:59:11] <$Sphincter_Spelunker> D: language
[0:59:14] <MetalSlimeHunt> D:
[0:59:15] <SilverFaustX> hob did a all boss + dlc no hit today
[0:59:17] <%JoshManVGH> Oh lord, god, why would anyone do that!
[0:59:20] <$cgreene64> I've only played DS3 with friends and goon squad all the way B)
[0:59:20] <SomeOtherNeb> Adult woman assaults disabled man and child (worldstar dot com)
[0:59:23] <T_Sasquatch> cunt is such a fun word
[0:59:23] <Jaysky> Now imagine this fight optimized for Paige
[0:59:24] <%ssjklyco> Is it cheating if the person in question lost to the elevator?
[0:59:30] <Jaysky> *unoptimized
[0:59:33] <MetalSlimeHunt> Gonna have to censor that one before it goes on YT LUL
[0:59:39] <%KeiganOfAstora> @PatStaresAt Maybe those extra estus and bone shards might help so she doesn't use have to double-sip as often
[0:59:41] <%nip_nips> @JoshManVGH sl1 is a fun challenge when you can breeze through the game with a normal build
[0:59:46] <%KeiganOfAstora> ?
[0:59:48] <ryderbootz> if you've never beat Soul of Cinder, than you've never REALLY beat DS3!
[1:00:17] <+Calek> if you've never beaten the last boss can you really say you've beaten it?
[1:00:19] <$cgreene64> 🤔
[1:00:29] <EuropanLamprey> If you know what Estus tastes like, can you truly be a Dark Soul?
[1:00:31] <%AncelDeLambert> Paige please just hit him from th efront
[1:00:37] <BoxNavy> hitting his back seems really difficult cus of those fast 180s
[1:00:37] <%sick_kickflips> SWING ON HIN
[1:00:38] <%KeiganOfAstora> stamina
[1:00:45] <%nip_nips> the twink strikes back
[1:00:47] <%NeonLight> Spent that meter
[1:00:49] <Coystick> Staminalet lmao
[1:00:50] <Copious_Koopies> doing good so far
[1:00:56] <Melchior_the_Wise> the twinks still doing good?
[1:01:00] <%KeiganOfAstora> no more heals
[1:01:04] <SomeOtherNeb> there's good work being done here
[1:01:10] <%RayReborne> trying to hit him in the back seems to be making you do worse
[1:01:10] <TheStrongBanana> You can do it hammer!
[1:01:12] <freelancebabymaker> @peachsaliva theres an estus shard or whatever up on the rooftops on the other end of the bridge if youd like a break
[1:01:12] <%AncelDeLambert> it's not worth it to ALWAYS go for the early damage on Lothric, just hit big bro from the front
[1:01:13] <sean2946> Paige, we have faith in you!!! No matter how many times it takes, dust yourself off and try again. You can do it!
[1:01:16] <+MidnightBurst12> good try
[1:01:17] <$cgreene64> gotcha with a left hook there
[1:01:18] <%KeiganOfAstora> @PeachSaliva How do you feel?
[1:01:20] <%femto216> This is the wrong built for this boss
[1:01:21] <SilverFaustX> wanna know how to cheese him?
[1:01:25] <%RayReborne> SEEMS to anyway
[1:01:26] <ryderbootz> dont let that twink dark your soul paige
[1:01:27] <@PatStaresAt> @PeachSaliva the guy who told you to aim for the back did you wrong. Just focus on hits. The time it takes to walk around to his ass isn't worth it
[1:01:28] <Zeif00> you're getting further each time <3
[1:01:29] <ChungusQuest> He's such a shit heel and a class act at the same time
[1:01:34] <%skm742> You've definitely got this. Improving very quickly.
[1:01:34] <%cade_calrayn> Yeah, try hitting him more from the front
[1:01:35] <%JoshManVGH> That follow up is rough, but great dodge of the light wave
[1:01:39] <peachy996> you're learning it more and more
[1:01:44] <boomstickery> yeah just use roll attack
[1:01:45] <%TheWinged7> well, ive gotta go get my covid jab, GL @PeachSaliva hopefully youll be a the final boss my the time im back
[1:01:46] <%ssjklyco> Beat him so hard that he is no longer disabled
[1:01:49] <tanjietv> dodge straight behind him
[1:01:52] <Monkeyweed21> Twunk first
[1:01:54] <$Sphincter_Spelunker> only one direction. forward
[1:01:55] <+Aarseth> Yeah just hit, don't bother walking all the way to the center of his back
[1:01:56] <%SophiaAmoreaVeritas> You're getting better.
[1:01:58] <tanjietv> thats the whole point of the fight
[1:01:58] <Monkeyweed21> then Twink
[1:02:01] <$Puhff> ok I wasn't WRONG in that the twink will die first
[1:02:02] <fruit_pie_the_magician> The hammer hits them both half the time anyway
[1:02:02] <mattynezz> I wish Pat didn't convince Paige that spamming R1 with no stamina did more damage than just chillin' for a sec
[1:02:02] <%CantWalkGood> yeah make sure you have stamina though and you can get more hits
[1:02:03] <freelancebabymaker> the smaller one never heals
[1:02:04] <EuropanLamprey> With a big enough weapon, you should hit both anyway
[1:02:06] <Melchior_the_Wise> get that big guy up
[1:02:06] <%AncelDeLambert> just beat the shit out of him on the ground
[1:02:08] <%nip_nips> ELEVATOR BOSS
[1:02:11] <%RayReborne> it takes a revive to kill little bro anyway lol
[1:02:11] <%AncelDeLambert> LUL
[1:02:11] <freelancebabymaker> ah shit here we go again
[1:02:14] <%Garthunox> but he gets up with less health each time
[1:02:16] <%Bt_Robot> Like Throne Watcher and Defender
[1:02:18] <SilverFaustX> rollin more important than walkin
[1:02:18] <BoxNavy> :)
[1:02:19] <%TheWinged7> secret found
[1:02:20] <$Puhff> I never said it was a GOOD idea
[1:02:21] <%cade_calrayn> Yeah, it's a cycle, you can get him down in two goes with your damage, Paige
[1:02:26] <$Kriptin> The bigger guy is weaker each time he's revived
[1:02:28] <%JoshManVGH> Make him regret ever inbibing those flavor crystals!
[1:02:31] <%nip_nips> nope
[1:02:32] <Monkeyweed21> he revives with less health each time
[1:02:33] <+FackinCrazy> Rolling back is getting you hit by his pokes try rolling through them instead if you can
[1:02:34] <%Garthunox> nope
[1:02:35] <$AmanDotZip> NOT YOUR WEAPON
[1:02:36] <+Axellogic> RETURN THE SLAB
[1:02:38] <SomeOtherNeb> not on your weapon, it's a boss weapon

[1:04:24] <keemii_don> had*
[1:04:25] <%KeiganOfAstora> Did that Courage joke get tied to Dark Souls back in DS1?
[1:04:28] <EuropanLamprey> THE MAN IN GAUZE
[1:04:29] <mattynezz> Damn
[1:04:30] <@MelBrooksKA> It took us a shit long time to get cable too, I missed like Dexter's Lab and the Power Puff Girls as a kid
[1:04:35] <+thelonechris> The man in guaze~
[1:04:38] <fruit_pie_the_magician> Had like 10 channels before then, I remember being jealous that other people could watch the aladdin show and freakazoid and shit
[1:04:39] <mattynezz> This one is going well
[1:04:51] <SomeOtherNeb> she's improved so much, I'm impressed!
[1:04:55] <%kewlmyc> Those are some meaty hits from Paige
[1:04:57] <peachy996> I had cable on and off as a kid
[1:04:58] <$Sphincter_Spelunker> @SomeOtherNeb no, I mean this stream. Chat made the same joke and she said return the slab in the same cadence
[1:05:03] <freelancebabymaker> i always had cable as a kid because my uncle knew how to pirate shit lmao
[1:05:03] <%alternative_flu> nice
[1:05:04] <cache_22> Hammer (and Paige) are doing work
[1:05:05] <@PatStaresAt> @PeachSaliva In phase 2, if big boy is almost dead, go for single hits so you have more stamina for smol boy
[1:05:05] <+MidnightBurst12> nice
[1:05:06] <%KeiganOfAstora> My parents were big tv and movie people so we had cable all through my childhood. Loved it
[1:05:07] <%WhereIsWill> dramatic finish!
[1:05:08] <%Agami23> that was anime as fuck
[1:05:09] <+Axellogic> Good job rolling when it is time now
[1:05:22] <+Axellogic> oh no
[1:05:28] <+Axellogic> Why hath I spoken
[1:05:31] <$SinisterBroccoli> I think you may be able to avoid the magic by just running?
[1:05:44] <Coystick> Roll count: 38463789437598
[1:05:44] <freelancebabymaker> NICE
[1:05:46] <T_Sasquatch> heavy weapons in souls games just look like stress
[1:05:51] <%JoshManVGH> We didn't have cable until I was in high school. But I remember visiting my grandparents in the boonies where they did have cable. Blew my little mind that there was a channel of nothing but cartoons.
[1:05:53] <SomeOtherNeb> hey Lothric if you're so strong why can't you walk
[1:06:04] <ryderbootz> remember your Double Ds, "Dont Dead"

[1:06:31] <Coystick> KA-CHUNK
[1:06:32] <@PatStaresAt> That attempt was a quantum leap forward babe
[1:06:33] <freelancebabymaker> ember
[1:06:33] <keemii_don> glorySuffer glorySuffer
[1:06:33] <ChungusQuest> Yo that was good tho
[1:06:33] <mattynezz> I just realized that Souls Bosses are basically Punch Out fights
[1:06:34] <%KeiganOfAstora> That's the two-hander, big damage
[1:06:34] <%Lion_kun> The delay
[1:06:35] <+loukemia83> That was a good one!
[1:06:35] <%graemecrackers2> Why dosen't Dark Souls put out replica swords, id love to get them on my walls
[1:06:37] <Marakami_Sadaneo> You can do it Paige cirNeuron
[1:06:39] <%AncelDeLambert> ember up
[1:06:39] <%ssjklyco> You were seeing it that last stretch with the good rolls
[1:06:39] <ryderbootz> GAME
[1:06:40] <%WhereIsWill> good fight tho forreal
[1:06:43] <+loukemia83> Getting the timing down!
[1:06:43] <peachy996> this was before adult swim too
[1:06:46] <keemii_don> Hit for Six
[1:06:47] <%JoshManVGH> Those dodges where fucking great though!
[1:06:49] <+RowenCleric> does hte v tuber model have an angry determined face?
[1:06:49] <%RayReborne> Big reads, Great try!!
[1:06:54] <%nip_nips> shes getting better at the dodges
[1:06:55] <+CptOblivion> I've been lurking for a while, but your exploits with vtuber-ing have inspired me to start learning how to make avatars, it's a blast! thanks for showing me the light!
[1:06:56] <%KeiganOfAstora> @graemecrackers2 Etsy has stuff
[1:07:00] <%SophiaAmoreaVeritas> Great reaction times.
[1:07:04] <peachy996> before adult swim you had a gigantic block of hanna barbera cartoons
[1:07:04] <freelancebabymaker> @RowenCleric it can only sob
[1:07:05] <%vVAstrAVv> paige stop trying to create distance if the moves he uses at distance will kill you lol
[1:07:15] <+RowenCleric> it can only cry.... so sad haha
[1:07:21] <$Sphincter_Spelunker> roll toward
[1:07:21] <%Agami23> that advice is bad
[1:07:25] <+FoolsArcade> Don't roll to get places, roll to dodge!
[1:07:25] <+loukemia83> Distance is good for heal
[1:07:28] <%nip_nips> distance just means you cant hit him when he has openings
[1:07:30] <%KeiganOfAstora> You need an undead bone shard so your estus is stronger
[1:07:31] <%worldbrand> Just bash his noggin in, you got this
[1:07:33] <%king_wragles> Paige, just imagine they're both women
[1:07:36] <@PatStaresAt> @PeachSaliva Distance is great for heal and defense ignore that guy
[1:07:37] <%ssjklyco> Your counting is working actually
[1:07:37] <%AmanDotZip> what can we talk about now that pat isnt around 😏😏
[1:07:38] <Melchior_the_Wise> I caught you at the Road Show with the Dick show guys, great performance
[1:07:40] <%Ranryu692> Also don't back into walls LUL
[1:07:46] <ChungusQuest> Keep counting! Nice, orderly, structured numbers in sequence is good for brain
[1:07:50] <%Grimlockfly> i would recommend hitting the guy till dead
[1:07:52] <%nip_nips> distance is not good for defense he TELEPORTS
[1:07:54] <$Sphincter_Spelunker> atpCap
[1:07:55] <%vVAstrAVv> oh yeah the light things are the one time thats fine
[1:07:55] <+CptOblivion> keep your distance, but also be close at the same time
[1:07:56] <%SophiaAmoreaVeritas> I agree with Pat
[1:07:57] <%Garthunox> 1 more wont help
[1:07:58] <BoxNavy> :) ...
[1:07:58] <andiianfii> not really
[1:08:00] <%MechArch> psaSmug
[1:08:00] <%graemecrackers2> Shes barren!
[1:08:01] <freelancebabymaker> pretty sure theres one at the other end of the bridge
[1:08:01] <%KeiganOfAstora> More time to think about it lol
[1:08:01] <@PatStaresAt> @PeachSaliva I have no idea where the ones you missed are lol
[1:08:02] <%patriotrenegade> naw you got this
[1:08:04] <%AmanDotZip> sadge
[1:08:08] <%CubicPhantom> you're developing a strategy, and it's working to get you farther into the fight. you do you
[1:08:16] <%RayReborne> other side
[1:08:16] <%JoshManVGH> Ember for edge?
[1:08:19] <EuropanLamprey> One's behind the angels, the other two are in Demon Ruins
[1:08:21] <happy_void> the duality of chat
[1:08:21] <@PatStaresAt> @PeachSaliva I can help you do cleanup later but honestly one or two estus wont make a difference
[1:08:22] <%Garthunox> if you cant do it with what you have then the little difference 1 would make wont help all that much
[1:08:24] <%KeiganOfAstora> @PatStaresAt There's one on top of the Archives where those three angels are
[1:08:28] <%skm742> Listen to pat, he knows you better.
[1:08:31] <Monkeyweed21> @PatStaresAt theres an estus shard on the roof of the librarby
[1:08:31] <%cade_calrayn> Ember up for just a bit of an edge, yeah
[1:08:31] <%vVAstrAVv> distance is usually great but if you can bait out a move with a big opening its better
[1:08:35] <%SophiaAmoreaVeritas> woolieYE
[1:08:35] <$Sphincter_Spelunker> been there
[1:08:36] <ryderbootz> yeaa pop an ember
[1:08:39] <ChungusQuest> @PeachSaliva have you ever tried Green Blossom?
[1:08:44] <%RayReborne> ember up if you want
[1:08:46] <FlashFrame> 2 swings on little boy then back off because the heal/explosion is coming.
[1:08:48] <Melchior_the_Wise> thats the most embarassing way to be caught, with dick in hand
[1:08:48] <%KeiganOfAstora> I don't think more estus will help but having it heal more per estus is usefull
[1:08:50] <%patriotrenegade> Yeah, thats the mechanic.
[1:08:51] <andiianfii> have you tried not having your dick in your hand?
[1:08:53] <boomstickery> its still teh same roll and then roll attack when he finishes his combo
[1:08:55] <@SoFarFetched> USE SMALL WORDES
[1:08:56] <%graemecrackers2> Try hitting harder
[1:08:57] <@SoFarFetched> geefDense
[1:09:01] <%AmanDotZip> mama mia am i not speaka da good Ingles?
[1:09:01] <rosemon5001> she should fight the angels to get pat into a golden suit of armor cosplay
[1:09:03] <brambobelurkin> Swing Hammer
[1:09:04] <SilverFaustX> roll in to the fog gate
[1:09:04] <+SenorCounter> LOL
[1:09:05] <%nip_nips> MORE HIT, LESS DIE
[1:09:05] <@SoFarFetched> DO BIG SMASHY SMASHY
[1:09:06] <@PatStaresAt> @PeachSaliva So the trick with that Paige, is that you want to kill big boy with one hit and then use like 3-4 sweings on ltitle boy. You can't kill him in one go, it'll take 2
[1:09:06] <keemii_don> Dumb it down but be nice.
[1:09:06] <%KeiganOfAstora> I don't know how to do that lol
[1:09:09] <Monkeyweed21> GET UP IN HIS ARMPITS
[1:09:09] <Valkryna> your weapon art has poise on it. You could use it to tank hits
[1:09:10] <+WutangchickeN> wutang6FLAVOR wutang6FLAVOR wutang6FLAVOR
[1:09:10] <+FackinCrazy> The fight is supposed to be one of those bring them both down until you can kill them back to back but most people just brute force it
[1:09:10] <sosuke5> Use ember
[1:09:11] <+MidnightBurst12> LUL
[1:09:12] <freelancebabymaker> i just feel like she could really use more health
[1:09:13] <+thelonechris> Hit the bad man
[1:09:14] <%CantWalkGood> have you burned those undead bone shards?
[1:09:14] <drawerinkshow> Just dodge and let the hammer do the work
[1:09:14] <mr_saturday93> Paige is too innocent to understand
[1:09:17] <andiianfii> kill kill kill
[1:09:23] <%MechArch> do good job
[1:09:25] <%ssjklyco> Explain like I'm 10, but also can't see.
[1:09:26] <fruit_pie_the_magician> ME SMASH WITH CLUB
[1:09:26] <%KeiganOfAstora> Yea
[1:09:26] <%Grimlockfly> We love more hit, less die!
[1:09:26] <+doc_ock_rokc> @PeachSaliva Hug bad man to avoid long range attacks
[1:09:27] <+tempestzephyr> smash his dick
[1:09:27] <%KeiganOfAstora> yea yea
[1:09:27] <vonmaultke> Simplify your language but don't be sassy about it
[1:09:27] <%AmanDotZip> lmao it worked
[1:09:27] <Copious_Koopies> no
[1:09:29] <freelancebabymaker> yes
[1:09:30] <$vile_brand> your kinda panic rolling
[1:09:30] <SilverFaustX> no
[1:09:30] <%RayReborne> yeah

[1:09:31] <+Quack_of_Dawn> Pretty much
[1:09:32] <%patriotrenegade> yes
[1:09:33] <$Puhff> yes
[1:09:34] <FlashFrame> pretty much yes.
[1:09:34] <cache_22> Save END when defeat big man so you can hit little man
[1:09:35] <%JoshManVGH> Correct
[1:09:35] <$Puhff> no
[1:09:36] <Indigo_Automaton> Basically
[1:09:36] <%Bt_Robot> Second part is DPS race, ignore Big Boy
[1:09:36] <Copious_Koopies> you can kill both
[1:09:37] <%skm742> just expect it
[1:09:37] <+loukemia83> It's really hard for it not happen
[1:09:38] <%cade_calrayn> Yup! You're doing fantastic, Paige
[1:09:39] <@PatStaresAt> Pretty much, he has too much health
[1:09:39] <%AmanDotZip> yeah small man is meant to stay alive
[1:09:41] <%FacetiousAF> that's just the fight
[1:09:42] <%Maids4lyfe> little boy has more hp anyways
[1:09:42] <Finakala> Unless you're OP as shit, yes
[1:09:42] <%vVAstrAVv> big guy gets revived with less hp every time btw
[1:09:42] <@PatStaresAt> You *CAN* but it's super hard
[1:09:43] <%nip_nips> its expected for him to bring back big boi
[1:09:45] <boomstickery> just hit till die
[1:09:45] <penitentpendant> No, he's too tanky to kill in one down
[1:09:47] <%Idziman> you can hit little boy while he's on big boy's back
[1:09:48] <ryderbootz> try using both hands on the hammer, instead of using your left hand for giving them the middle finger
[1:09:49] <%Lion_kun> If you can hit the small man enough, it is possible to get him in one hit.
[1:09:49] <Monkeyweed21> Small man has BIG health
[1:09:49] <ToneBacas> just bonk bonk
[1:09:50] <%RayReborne> each revive brings big boy up with less health
[1:09:51] <boomstickery> smash till no smash
[1:09:51] <+doc_ock_rokc> @PeachSaliva Small man actual boss big man is his Add
[1:09:51] <%AmanDotZip> knowledge boom
[1:09:54] <%FacetiousAF> i'm gonna know Kreygasm
[1:09:54] <fruit_pie_the_magician> You actually CAN kill him before that, but it's kind of a pain in the ass
[1:09:55] <%geekjacob> yes
[1:09:55] <sosuke5> full of know stuff
[1:09:55] <%CubicPhantom> it's not a failure state, it's the gimmick of the fight
[1:09:56] <freelancebabymaker> i think you just need to watch your stamina when big man goes down
[1:09:59] <KaiserMario> Pat is a poo poo head
[1:09:59] <%vivaciouseff> you *can* in one go, but you need some like busted good equip
[1:10:00] <andiianfii> you are big no frighten
[1:10:00] <%JoshManVGH> Nah you basically got to phase 3 and got splat
[1:10:00] <%MarylandJutsu> Full of Knowledge....and Lupus
[1:10:01] <SilverFaustX> depends on weapon and build
[1:10:03] <@PatStaresAt> I love this confused woman
[1:10:05] <%Major_Lee_> kill big bro then whack the twink bro while revive
[1:10:05] <%Agami23> your weapon is also good for this because its so big its clipping through big boy and dealing small damage to the twink
[1:10:06] <%Bt_Robot> Boss fight ends with little brother's death
[1:10:08] <%AmanDotZip> @KaiserMario its true
[1:10:12] <%vVAstrAVv> yeah don't be frightened
[1:10:18] <%AncelDeLambert> ha ha, Pat loves you, NEEEEEERD
[1:10:20] <%nip_nips> pat big poo poo head
[1:10:24] <Lewin_Godwynn> Also when the big boy does his big flashy sword with wave of magic after, small boi throws a big magic spear.
[1:10:24] <SilverFaustX> yea like this
[1:10:36] <%MarylandJutsu> @PatStaresAt you really did put a ring on it
[1:10:38] <keemii_don> Pray to RNjesus tht it pays off

[1:12:46] <@PatStaresAt> @PeachSaliva Cool detail is that his soul magic is pure white instead of blue. I think it's because of his dragon experiment bullshit his dad was into

[1:13:18] <mr_saturday93> @patstaresat I thought it was because of that holy magic shit
[1:13:18] <%AncelDeLambert> nah, he adapted the magic to use faith
[1:13:20] <%Kriptin> No, it's because it's Blessed
[1:13:23] <%AmanDotZip> oh you should hav a death tracker

[1:13:57] <Coystick> Everything
[1:13:58] <BoxNavy> da lore
[1:14:01] <%RayReborne> Lore lol
[1:14:01] <%AncelDeLambert> lore
[1:14:02] <@PatStaresAt> Im wrong about the lore ;_;
[1:14:04] <%nip_nips> what ISNT he wrong about
[1:14:05] <%vVAstrAVv> itll block the light show perhaps but then big guy
[1:14:05] <+Walopoh> L O R E
[1:14:09] <Lewin_Godwynn> This isn't Anor Londo.
[1:14:14] <%alternative_flu> make it your head cannon
[1:14:15] <+zamatermort> Everything, Pat is always wrong
[1:14:20] <%CubicPhantom> I do admire that confidence
[1:14:21] <@PatStaresAt> Its good to talk with confidence!
[1:14:21] <@commanderclaw> That's cause Pat is a SIGMA MALE
[1:14:22] <Coystick> PattiVidya
[1:14:22] <boomstickery> he talks crazy talk
[1:14:22] <%SophiaAmoreaVeritas> nothing
[1:14:25] <%alternative_flu> fuck everyone else's opinion
[1:14:26] <%Agami23> have confidence
[1:14:27] <$Sphincter_Spelunker> Man is wrong but also loud so who knows
[1:14:28] <%patriotrenegade> More like Ligma male
[1:14:29] <+Walopoh> Especially this series in particular LUL
[1:14:31] <hairtoday> pat is right to forget about miracles
[1:14:31] <+thelonechris> Saying that Pat's wrong about something is like pointing out that the sky is blue
[1:14:32] <Lewin_Godwynn> Pat Manvin
[1:14:39] <%Grimlockfly> @PatStaresAt Crazy talk doesn't work as well in twitch chat
[1:14:39] <%SuckerPunchSyd> Don’t fall in when you go pee
[1:14:41] <%KeiganOfAstora> You're no VaatiStaresAt that's for sure @PatStaresAt
[1:14:42] <%optimasmaximas> i thought the new thing to be was gigachad? @commanderclaw
[1:14:43] <+doc_ock_rokc> Everything you know is wrong, up is down, left is right, and short is long
[1:14:43] <asdief_> dark souls lore is famous for being very clear and consistent
[1:14:45] <+Quack_of_Dawn> This kid was basically groomed to become cinder so of course it's a miracles
[1:14:46] <EuropanLamprey> I think the magic is white because Lothric is a faith build, his weapon is Faith
[1:15:02] <@commanderclaw> @optimasmaximas Woolie is the Gigachad, Pat is the Sigma Male
[1:15:11] <Coystick> Stop railing on this poor man's already shattered ass bone
[1:15:19] <Lewin_Godwynn> No keep doing it tho
[1:15:20] <%MarylandJutsu> Paige is a biker man from a biker gang
[1:15:20] <%vVAstrAVv> also pat remember just osirus was obsessed with dragons. the rest of lothric was obsessed with gertrude
[1:15:25] <%optimasmaximas> @commanderclaw ah i see

[1:15:40] <mr_saturday93> I just want to point out that a crippled fictional character is beating the shit outta of real life crippled woman
[1:15:40] <+thelonechris> Is that what happened to this boss? He broke his ass and that's why he's crawling?
[1:15:40] <Coystick> "That was for my ass bone"
[1:15:41] <@PatStaresAt> This is fantastic improvement save for AVARICE
[1:15:42] <%vVAstrAVv> greed indeed
[1:15:44] <%doomunderthestairs> you should let out a big pee
[1:15:45] <%Ranryu692> you were distracted by the pee in your balls

[1:17:20] <%JoshManVGH> Telling you, just keep playing gunshot sounds to scare him away.
[1:17:22] <ChungusQuest> Have you made peace with the number 5 yet?
[1:17:23] <@PatStaresAt> Could you imagine if Paige was like related to John Wilkes Booth
[1:17:23] <cache_22> Paige hails from the land of Lincoln. That's why she's cursed.
[1:17:24] <mattynezz> Does that episode of the Venture Bros with Ghost Abraham Lincoln scare you?
[1:17:29] <SomeOtherNeb> Lincoln was so gay
[1:17:29] <$Sphincter_Spelunker> who is money

[1:17:39] <oozebear> but there's money on the line!
[1:17:39] <+doc_ock_rokc> @PatStaresAt She could be related to Doctor Mud
[1:17:39] <SomeOtherNeb> PAT LUL

[1:17:45] <Drurr> At least you know he wouldn't lie about it
[1:17:45] <Magicferret> Lincoln had 5 kids or something
[1:17:46] <%nip_nips> just get lincoln to take you to a gay bar
[1:17:46] <cache_22> Lincoln was a wrestler.
[1:17:46] <%vVAstrAVv> which idk how you can beat bloodborne and still be scared of big nighttime lol

[1:17:54] <+ThomasOfTroy> That'd be fucking HILARIOUS
[1:17:56] <asdief_> he did go to a theatre

[1:19:20] <%JoshManVGH> All you're asking them to do is come sit on a chair, this is a fairly extreme response.
[1:19:20] <mr_saturday93> Empty your balls

[1:19:41] <%SuckerPunchSyd> Why do those little bars pop up when you come back to life?
[1:19:44] <%SophiaAmoreaVeritas> woolieSMUG
[1:19:44] <+ThomasOfTroy> Keep an eye out for Lincoln, supposedly he liked to wait in bathrooms
[1:19:47] <%SophiaAmoreaVeritas> SeemsGood
[1:19:52] <@PatStaresAt> Is that true thomas
[1:19:57] <andiianfii> rings taking effect
[1:19:59] <%FacetiousAF> FeelsBadMan i've been watching so many VODs i thought i could skip this
[1:20:05] <$Sphincter_Spelunker> @SuckerPunchSyd it's resistance bars from items
[1:20:07] <FlashFrame> one of the best BRB screens I've ever seen.
[1:20:11] <%SuckerPunchSyd> Ahh gotcha! Thanks!
[1:20:12] <%JoshManVGH> Wait in bathrooms and do what?
[1:20:18] <%vVAstrAVv> @suckerpunchsyd cus something is boosting her resistences and games are dumb
[1:20:26] <+FackinCrazy> Ok real talk who would win in a fight the ghost of Abe Lincoln or the brave little toaster
[1:20:33] <@PatStaresAt> Its the prisoners chain I thinkj
[1:20:39] <andiianfii> abe, that dude was jacked
[1:20:41] <oozebear> Abe's got the reach, that's what fight club taught me
[1:20:42] <satiresatyr> toaster
[1:20:48] <%alternative_flu> toasters can kill tho
[1:20:48] <mattynezz> Ghost Abe is immortal and has reach
[1:20:50] <Marakami_Sadaneo> beep beep
[1:20:52] <FlashFrame> Abe's got Reach, but the BLT can do anything so...
[1:20:53] <satiresatyr> get eletrocuted
[1:20:53] <+FackinCrazy> but toaster has the heat man
[1:20:55] <MidnightSnack69> teqEyes
[1:20:56] <%KeiganOfAstora> @PatStaresAt Switch Prisoner's Chain for Ring of Steel Protection?
[1:21:00] <%alternative_flu> and abe was killed so I think toaster wins
[1:21:04] <%KeiganOfAstora> Does she have Wolf Ring?
[1:21:06] <%JoshManVGH> Brave Little Toaster, what is and Old ghost gonna do against modern technology that's also alive.
[1:21:11] <+ThomasOfTroy> @PatStaresAt Yes. While taking a bath at the White House, Winston Churchhill was visited by the ghost of Lincoln. I'm not even joking
[1:21:12] <mattynezz> But GHOST Abe was never killed
[1:21:12] <ryderbootz> ghosts cant touch you, so the toaster wins
[1:21:20] <sirrice77> what is a toaster but a small underpowered death ray?
[1:21:22] <+FackinCrazy> And im pretty sure toaster is crazy from when the ac killed itself
[1:21:25] <@PatStaresAt> Eh, health or estus isn't the issue here. it's just getting it down and thats happen
[1:21:30] <@SoFarFetched> just remember,if you're choking on air,that's ghost dicks geefPlz

[1:22:41] <FlashFrame> She's been doing quite well.
[1:22:44] <%JoshManVGH> What if the Ghost of Abe Lincoln just wants to see the end of the play he never got to see? And all Paige has to do is perform the play to send him on.
[1:22:59] <%AncelDeLambert> ahem hem hem
[1:23:00] <$Sphincter_Spelunker> she should buy embers instead of levels
[1:23:02] <@PatStaresAt> Ill help her find the other shards before DLC streams, cause she'll never be going back to those old areas

[1:23:22] <%RayReborne> lol
[1:23:24] <%vVAstrAVv> shes used soul items pretty liberally i wouldnt expect her to have 1 levels worth let alone more
[1:23:31] <%AncelDeLambert> ... I kinda expected todays stream to be short, since it's only three bosses and that's the game, but oopsie me

[1:29:55] <+dancedancemans> ds2 is great smfh
[1:29:59] <calzonewithextracheese> Bruh what, DS2 DLC was the best part of the game
[1:30:00] <$shurtal> sipsipElmo_SG
[1:30:00] <%JoshManVGH> Gorgling for luck!
[1:30:03] <Dunmarkh> nothin personnel kid
[1:30:03] <PocketBearIllustrator> I oughta try playing Dark Souls with friends. what's it like with coop?
[1:30:06] <+TheApproachingSnom> He is ANGY
[1:30:06] <%Garthunox> @evilchris22 whats it like being so wrong?
[1:30:07] <peachy996> It's funny you played the entire boring part of DS2 ie the base game and skipped all of the somewhat interesting DLC
[1:30:09] <+razielhex> TELEPORTIN' BITCH
[1:30:12] <%JoshManVGH> The gorgaling has failed you!
[1:30:13] <%vVAstrAVv> time to just die lol
[1:30:13] <@PatStaresAt> Paige is hydrated
[1:30:41] <+A_Cat_Herder> chat it is possible to parry this or will it just smash through?
[1:30:45] <freelancebabymaker> the fox girl must be watered regularly
[1:30:51] <%MarylandJutsu> @PeachSaliva what if......the two brother but gief and elmo. gief is the one with the big sword, elmo is the one with the magic
[1:30:52] <BigFingerRo> BAD MAN
[1:31:00] <%Lion_kun> That attack has a delay
[1:31:00] <+Quack_of_Dawn> I know there's a lot you just can't parry in this game
[1:31:01] <Coystick> Maybe she plays better dehydrated?
[1:31:03] <+A_Cat_Herder> correction: is it possible to parry
[1:31:04] <%Draylle> it did not resonate with joy
[1:31:06] <%JoshManVGH> Can one parry with a twohaned weapon?
[1:31:07] <%patriotrenegade> coward
[1:31:10] <%doomunderthestairs> yeah same here
[1:31:10] <@commanderclaw> I didn't even finish DS2, I disliked how it felt
[1:31:11] <SMuffinMan> 2 is ass honestly
[1:31:11] <$SirGO0SE> hello friends :)
[1:31:13] <%Garthunox> nah
[1:31:14] <+jordy_j_s> she's just collecting frame data rn trust trust
[1:31:15] <+CrabStealer> That's the case with most people
[1:31:15] <+gksnipa> dlc is overratef tbh
[1:31:15] <%Garthunox> its not
[1:31:16] <+RickyJZ> Same I bounced off of Dark Souls 2 HARD.
[1:31:16] <@PatStaresAt> @PeachSaliva Hey Paige, btw lemme know if Im bugging you too much, but nearly 100% of rolls on this one should be directly to the left or right
[1:31:18] <+redreymar> every single time he says "you may rest here if you like" i think if tyler1 breaking his controller lmao]
[1:31:18] <Coystick> But the Crowns are soooo good it hurts
[1:31:20] <%MarylandJutsu> DLC of DS2 isn't bad
[1:31:29] <Sir_Gawain_Lotsson> DS2 Ice world is really hard
[1:31:29] <+A_Cat_Herder> @JoshManVGH Oh right, I forgot that you can't parry when double handing
[1:31:29] <%mikehuntis4timmy> @PeachSaliva i think cuz this ones a bit more like bloodborne fast but not that fast
[1:31:31] <+FackinCrazy> DS2 is also like twice as long as 1 and 3
[1:31:31] <+Walopoh> hydration swole
[1:31:33] <%Agami23> the DLC has some of the worst shit in DS2
[1:31:35] <%Bt_Robot> OK, WHEN OLDER BROTHER LIFTS HIS SWORD OVER HIS HEAD FOR A BIG SMASH, JUST WALK TO THE RIGHT AND GET A HIT IN
[1:31:35] <mattynezz> She's just saying that because Poise sucks in DS2
[1:31:37] <%vVAstrAVv> any demons souls interest paige?
[1:31:38] <peachy996> The DLCs for 2 at least try to give you a Dark Souls feel whereas the base game is just so...generic
[1:31:39] <lotharrio> Well I mean, DS2 is so lengthy. It took Paige a full year, basically, to finish it!
[1:31:40] <%Grimlockfly> The DLC is pieces of manus became queens and fucked up the kings of foreign lands
[1:31:42] <%Garthunox> @PeachSaliva in all of the DS2 dlc it has 1, maybe 2, standout bosses, thats it
[1:31:44] <peachy996> lifeless
[1:31:45] <$Sphincter_Spelunker> will she beat the elevator
[1:31:50] <andiianfii> poise is way worse in ds3 though
[1:31:51] <Sir_Gawain_Lotsson> the unicorns in Fuck Valley really destroy you
[1:31:53] <%KeiganOfAstora> Does she know how poise works?
[1:31:54] <peachy996> Majula Theme is nice tho
[1:31:57] <calzonewithextracheese> Poise isnt a think in 3
[1:31:59] <%RayReborne> Gonna ember up? got a few to spare right?
[1:32:02] <SomeOtherNeb> Poise barely exists in DS3 why are we discussing it
[1:32:02] <Dunmarkh> well you got hit a lot so I guess
[1:32:04] <WickedTwizzler> pat navi always helpful t101Bless
[1:32:05] <%KeiganOfAstora> EMbers, remember?
[1:32:06] <Coystick> You shave off half of Vanilla DS2 and replace it with the Lost Crowns Trilogy and DS2 is a perfect game
[1:32:06] <%KeiganOfAstora> Embers
[1:32:07] <%patriotrenegade> Poise isnt in 3, its in 2
[1:32:09] <%KeiganOfAstora> Yes please
[1:32:09] <+RahkshiLord> everything sucks in ds2 not just poise
[1:32:11] <BoxNavy> go for it
[1:32:12] <freelancebabymaker> why not
[1:32:12] <%KeiganOfAstora> First item
[1:32:15] <%JoshManVGH> I thought poise worked in 2 but was fucked in 3
[1:32:16] <%KeiganOfAstora> YES YOU HAVE 51
[1:32:16] <+TheApproachingSnom> Cheer200 Apparently Lorian can be parried in one specific swing but you're guaranteed to take damage of you do it anyway LUL LUL
[1:32:18] <+RickyJZ> yeah
[1:32:18] <%NeonLight> Thats plenty of embers
[1:32:19] <Gelphaze> it can help
[1:32:20] <SomeOtherNeb> why not, if it helps!
[1:32:20] <+ThomasOfTroy> Ah yes, the tigers of horse fuck alley, who can forget
[1:32:20] <%Agami23> go for it, you have 51
[1:32:20] <%SophiaAmoreaVeritas> Try it with an ember ONCE
[1:32:21] <%ssjklyco> Sure
[1:32:22] <$vile_brand> leveling up a bit might be a good idea
[1:32:22] <$Sphincter_Spelunker> use it as a heal in phase 2?
[1:32:22] <mattynezz> Sorry, Armor, not poise, been a minute
[1:32:23] <lotharrio> Sure you have too many anyway.
[1:32:23] <benjiFG> yes
[1:32:23] <+RickyJZ> You've got a ton of them
[1:32:23] <%RayReborne> 50 lmao YES
[1:32:23] <Zeif00> ye
[1:32:24] <sirrice77> it will give extra health if you think that helps
[1:32:24] <freelancebabymaker> YOU HAVE 51???
[1:32:25] <calzonewithextracheese> Bruh DS2 is fine, it's like a 7/10 game
[1:32:26] <%Bt_Robot> yOU DON'T WANT SUMMONS?
[1:32:26] <+CptOblivion> I dunno, you'll only have 50 left if you do
[1:32:28] <%KeiganOfAstora> You get so much more health
[1:32:29] <TheZearGuy> What if you need them later
[1:32:29] <@PatStaresAt> You have 51 embers, its the first item on the menu when you press start
[1:32:30] <+tupacula1996> yes
[1:32:31] <%vVAstrAVv> what if you need it later
[1:32:33] <%JoshManVGH> Flame on!
[1:32:33] <+ALazo> poise is the ability to get slapped in the face and not flinch. Is it something you did a lot?
[1:32:41] <%graemecrackers2> Pop that shit
[1:32:43] <+FackinCrazy> Power stancing should come back tho
[1:32:49] <sosuke5> But what if you need them later?
[1:32:50] <%KeiganOfAstora> Chunky HP
[1:32:54] <%JoshManVGH> Edge!
[1:32:55] <BoxNavy> look at that HEALTH
[1:32:55] <%Lets_frown> hey dude
[1:32:56] <WickedTwizzler> now you are big and strong
[1:32:57] <%patriotrenegade> But you might need it for later!
[1:33:00] <Lewin_Godwynn> Big and strong with the HP to match
[1:33:01] <freelancebabymaker> well you still have 50 of them so
[1:33:04] <+RahkshiLord> pro tip: just stop getting hit
[1:33:07] <%KeiganOfAstora> More HP is nice
[1:33:10] <andiianfii> ds2 is a solid 8/10 wich is good compared to ds3's 7
[1:33:13] <%KeiganOfAstora> Those times when you would die you won't now
[1:33:14] <%JoshManVGH> Holy crap has Paige played Catherine!?
[1:33:15] <%RayReborne> it's the end of the main game @sosuke5 lmao
[1:33:16] <keemii_don> Nth times the charm
[1:33:17] <SomeOtherNeb> those DODGES
[1:33:20] <%AncelDeLambert> stiiiil trying to backstab the boss
[1:33:23] <%NeonLight> Thats a boss health bar right there
[1:33:26] <+Kyma1020> BOY CAME SWINGING
[1:33:27] <+CptOblivion> is poise also related to staggering the boss? I noticed it happened at least once, but maybe that's a specific counter-hit mechanic or something
[1:33:29] <+Axellogic> PAIGE I BELIEVE IN YOU!
[1:33:31] <+Axellogic> I think
[1:33:35] <$Sphincter_Spelunker> @andiianfii you sound like you like pineapple on pizza
[1:33:36] <%doomunderthestairs> yeah ds2 was pretty bland compared to ds3
[1:33:38] <Tahzani> This guy is so flexible for his condition. Must do yoga
[1:33:39] <peachy996> 7/10 game perfectly describes DSII but also does it no favors
[1:33:40] <%KeiganOfAstora> @CptOblivion Sort of. Enemies have poise too
[1:33:44] <$TheApproachingSnom> One-hit frost buildup is BUSTED in this fight!
[1:33:45] <%AncelDeLambert> badoop?

[1:39:40] <%AncelDeLambert> @PeachSaliva you can check required souls to level up in your stat menu without talking to Firekeeper
[1:39:42] <$Sphincter_Spelunker> @PeachSaliva time for a harder boss
[1:39:44] <sirrice77> @PeachSaliva doesn't matter for you but if you defeat the brothers twice, as in again in NG+, if you get both of their swords from Ludleth they can be combined to form a third sword
[1:39:45] <freelancebabymaker> lAAADYYY

[2:41:18] <Finakala> @TheWinged7 Only Nameless King is left, and she's there
[2:41:23] <%Garthunox> why save the princes?
[2:41:26] <brachydios777> Consume
[2:41:28] <Marakami_Sadaneo> remember chat, she has no memory
[2:41:29] <%patriotrenegade> @PeachSaliva Do you plan on doing NG+?
[2:41:30] <$shurtal> two princes, like the SONG
[2:41:33] <Indigo_Automaton> Eat the Prince too, you aren't gonna use their swords, they need magic
[2:41:33] <+CptOblivion> I feel like a lot of these descriptions are also lore that chat has been talking about a lot so it's stuff you already know
[2:41:34] <Wiiplayah43> @DanThePumpkinman Kinda was, yeah. Lack of prominent 3rd party games was a real bummer.
[2:41:35] <peachy996> Save the princes as Dessert
[2:41:37] <Yrelask> we need a royal family soul tier list
[2:41:37] <$Puhff> yeah vaati cool
[2:41:37] <%VexicBayn> Vaati is just bedtime stories for doomers
[2:41:39] <%geekjacob> yeah its super calming
[2:41:40] <%TheWinged7> @Finakala ok ty, ill have to go back and watch it later
[2:41:40] <rudiciuscaesar> wait, Paige hasn't even watched Vaati's Bloodborne stuff?
[2:41:42] <%Garthunox> ye
[2:41:42] <@PatStaresAt> Yeah it needs NG+
[2:41:42] <%GalacticaPhanto> You're never gonna use the weapon in your current build tho
[2:41:43] <%patriotrenegade> yes
[2:41:45] <+Patch_TheSquid> Vaati's shit is top tier
[2:41:46] <$shurtal> the hammer is fully upgrade, right?
[2:41:47] <T_Sasquatch> well personally i think it because the souls give unique shit so people dont want her to miss out
[2:41:52] <%geekjacob> yeah you sadly do
[2:41:52] <benjiFG> you need ng+ to combine both brothers' swords
[2:41:52] <%Chimeraelite> that or have someone drop it off for you
[2:41:54] <tanarath> ng + to get the other half
[2:41:56] <+realm_forge> Paige likes to keep the boss thinks captive
[2:41:58] <Dunmarkh> paige that is the only one you will not use guaranteed
[2:41:59] <@PatStaresAt> @PeachSaliva Honestly at this point the soul requirement is super high now
[2:42:00] <mattynezz> It's two swords, which you can glue together
[2:42:01] <%vVAstrAVv> ng+ for the COMBINED sword
[2:42:01] <peachy996> EAT EAT EAT
[2:42:03] <Finakala> The one boss weapon you could've used is already consoomed, so eat the rest
[2:42:05] <islandsunn> check with the old lady
[2:42:07] <blue8moon> You have plenty of time to eat it later if you want too
[2:42:08] <@PatStaresAt> You're probably good now
[2:42:09] <mattynezz> So you need two of those souls
[2:42:09] <%vVAstrAVv> the halves are still cool
[2:42:10] <Bit_Byter> Cheer3000 for V Tuber Paige - You stinky mustard queen
[2:42:10] <%SophiaAmoreaVeritas> @PatStaresAt Should she level up her current weapon?
[2:42:11] <islandsunn> when you try to sell souls it tells you
[2:42:13] <peachy996> She's a remorseless eating machine!
[2:42:14] <calzonewithextracheese> But if the only weapon she is using is this she doesn't need anything else
[2:42:15] <Dunmarkh> Why?
[2:42:16] <@PatStaresAt> @PeachSaliva Hey I love you you do big good job
[2:42:18] <valerios_> :(

[2:46:05] <rudiciuscaesar> That's Greg, the nameless king.
[2:46:06] <$shurtal> Gwyn's First born BABY
[2:46:06] <Sir_Gawain_Lotsson> Gwyn's kid
[2:46:07] <%Maids4lyfe> Gwyn's son
[2:46:07] <%ItsRatman> He doesnt have a name, we'll never know
[2:46:09] <valerios_> really good first try
[2:46:09] <BigYanno> Nameless King, AKA "opening? What opening?"
[2:46:10] <+tupacula1996> Thats Gwens kid
[2:46:10] <islandsunn> BIG NUMBER vs DO COMBO
[2:46:10] <%spitelite> 'thats it' -paige
[2:46:11] <Bit_Byter> big boi hurt
[2:46:11] <Finakala> He is the storm that is approaching
[2:46:13] <%Konquerer> i was gonna flip if you got that first try
[2:46:15] <%Monkeyweed21> Gwyn's CHAD son
[2:46:16] <%AncelDeLambert> that's the firstborn of Gwyn
[2:46:16] <@PatStaresAt> @PeachSaliva That's his son that got kicked out of Anor Londo, those missing statues way back when
[2:46:16] <mattynezz> Gwyn's Son who sided with the Dragons
[2:46:18] <Eightesu> his name might be Faraam
[2:46:23] <+VVerewolfJones> Nameless King is the moniker of every Subreddit owner.
[2:46:23] <+PkSilent01> his kid
[2:46:23] <+doc_ock_rokc> @PeachSaliva Gwyn's first born the inspiration for Solaire
[2:46:24] <+LensWander> You gonna let some dude without a name beat you, Paige?
[2:46:25] <DancesWitBalrog> She can kill him. That was a good attempt
[2:46:26] <$Sphincter_Spelunker> lost to the anals of history. I'm sure I spelled that right
[2:46:29] <leinadtonu> you hit brutally hard Paige, cool.
[2:46:34] <@PatStaresAt> @PeachSaliva He's the god of war in their pantheon
[2:46:35] <%Rumbutt> that's his son the dragon fucker
[2:46:38] <%GalacticaPhanto> @peachsaliva you did a fantastic first try
[2:46:39] <islandsunn> he's a massive badass
[2:46:41] <%SveriSageAdvice> he got kicked out because he sided with the dragons
[2:46:42] <BigYanno> Wasn't he the former god of war
[2:46:44] <islandsunn> oof
[2:46:45] <Dopamien> @Sphincter_Spelunker appropiate name
[2:46:45] <Finakala> I got so used to eating shit on Nameless that I could perfect the dragon every time
[2:46:46] <AthenaAegis> Enjoy Kappa
[2:46:46] <%cade_calrayn> he's Dark Souls' Kratos
[2:46:47] <luftraumm1> hes the guy solaire was trying to find right?
[2:46:52] <$hattrick61> man betrayed his family for drussy\
[2:46:54] <yourliteraldog> HADES
[2:46:58] <peachy996> This is the guy that lost the anals of history
[2:46:59] <T_Sasquatch> wasnt that jsut speculation ?
[2:47:00] <%CosmicInfinity> god i hate this fight
[2:47:04] <rudiciuscaesar> @cade_calrayn damn, he really is Dark Souls Kratos lol
[2:47:04] <%cade_calrayn> @hattrick61 I HATE that
[2:47:05] <Dunmarkh> @luftraumm1 he's the guy people thought solaire was
[2:47:08] <+zamatermort> Good swings LUL
[2:47:10] <%MechArch> good doges
[2:47:10] <Ravioli_Ronin> He likes to eat a war
[2:47:15] <%nip_nips> nameless king is a great fight but this first phase is just annoying
[2:47:17] <Melchior_the_Wise> Yeah, what games use a fucking CLAVICORD in their soundtracks?
[2:47:20] <islandsunn> DEPTH PERCEPTION
[2:47:22] <%RLT917> @hattrick61 atpRtsd
[2:47:23] <BigYanno> So the enemy in phase 1 is the camera. It sucks BALLS for this fight. Also the weird ground fucks with your perspective
[2:47:26] <Finakala> The depth perception in this fight is the real boss
[2:47:26] <yourliteraldog> Unga but no bunga
[2:47:28] <+loukemia83> I think Paige's eyes may betray her on this one
[2:47:30] <benjiFG> the camera is AWFUL
[2:47:31] <rudiciuscaesar> it's super hard to tell the distance with the clouds and no real floor, so don't get upset over that, Paige.
[2:47:32] <%MrBorisMakarov> these whiffs atpRtsd
[2:47:32] <+zamatermort> You have to HIT HIM WOOLIE
[2:47:34] <%That1blindkid> The depth on this fog floor is aids
[2:47:35] <MaximumOctober> big whiff
[2:47:36] <+RahkshiLord> he didn't LOSE the annals of history he was LOST TO THEM, as in, he was erased from history
[2:47:39] <+FiresideInternetCafe> The first phase has weird angles like this that make it a weird fight.
[2:47:40] <MyNameIsRasus> oh we're here huh
[2:47:44] <$Sphincter_Spelunker> atpRtsd1 atpRtsd2
[2:47:46] <%patriotrenegade> The Nameless King's model is actually bigger when he's on the dragon
[2:47:49] <+redreymar> THE MUSIC THO THIS FIGHT IS SO GOOD
[2:48:01] <+VVerewolfJones> Hehe, anals of history.
[2:48:03] <MyNameIsRasus> how far has she gotten?
[2:48:07] <valerios_> @redreymar amen m6kwMask
[2:48:08] <EuropanLamprey> @RahkshiLord His real crime was losing Gwyn's Van Helen Mixtape
[2:48:10] <BigYanno> So if you've ever wondered what it'd be like to be brutally murdered by a man riding a turkey this is it
[2:48:12] <BigFingerRo> well that's more like it!
[2:48:13] <CrypticMochi> You know, I hope they figured out how to do big boss fights in Elden Ring
[2:48:16] <Dunmarkh> @MyNameIsRasus second phase
[2:48:16] <brachydios777> rip
[2:48:16] <perfect_disaster> take your time
[2:48:19] <%ItsRatman> Imagine if all those whiffs hit :(
[2:48:19] <SMuffinMan> Pancaked LUL
[2:48:20] <%femto216> First attempt sometimes are the Best ones lol
[2:48:22] <@PatStaresAt> @PeachSaliva So the camera on this part sucks, basically the birds head is on the floor when Nameless is swinging
[2:48:26] <%MrBorisMakarov> @mynameisrasus second phase 75 percent
[2:48:27] <cooldude69xx> Looking at it from the outside, the camera really is the real enemy in phase 1
[2:48:31] <TheRealGreaterGamer> Dont even bother locking on IMO LUL
[2:48:32] <%vVAstrAVv> the camera must win
[2:48:32] <+FiresideInternetCafe> @CrypticMochi I think they figured it out in Sekiro TBH
[2:48:35] <MyNameIsRasus> ooh that's pretty good
[2:48:36] <Melchior_the_Wise> He is big strong
[2:48:40] <%Garthunox> @femto216 what about the attempt where you win?
[2:48:42] <%Monkeyweed21> this is the hardest thing in vanilla DS3 if you beat this you are GODLIKE
[2:48:44] <@PatStaresAt> SPEEN
[2:48:45] <rudiciuscaesar> costume changeeeee
[2:48:47] <valerios_> speen
[2:48:49] <afronooch> SPEEEEEN
[2:48:50] <Finakala> Yeah Sekiro's camera feltt better for bigger things, it still sucks in cramped spaces though
[2:48:52] <BoxNavy> vineChatspin
[2:48:54] <+Gondab> Eldin Ring boss fight where you ride your horse on the boss
[2:48:56] <CrypticMochi> Oh yeah I forget about Sekiro
[2:49:01] <%geekjacob> overhead swins are the best for this dragon
[2:49:02] <keemii_don> CHANGE SEQUENCE ACTIVATE
[2:49:08] <SMuffinMan> SONIC THE HEDGEHOG
[2:49:09] <MarsKarl> DxCat
[2:49:10] <perfect_disaster> so... how you guys doing
[2:49:10] <yourliteraldog> She is putting on something more modest
[2:49:14] <BigYanno> Phase 1 sucks, it really does. My main issue with this boss is that learning the king's patterns is locked behind bullshit camera boss
[2:49:17] <islandsunn> GET SMOKED
[2:49:23] <luftraumm1> why did summer dresses become a meme about being railed?
[2:49:24] <leinadtonu> costume change, like in those hot tub streams
[2:49:44] <DancesWitBalrog> speaking of SANIC, did yall hear about Chris Chan? monkaW
[2:49:56] <yourliteraldog> summer dresses are easy access
[2:49:59] <perfect_disaster> @DancesWitBalrog pls dont
[2:50:02] <Marakami_Sadaneo> can we not talk about that
[2:50:07] <%Monkeyweed21> @Gondab elden ring boss where you ride the boss who IS a horse
[2:50:12] <Yrelask> brb, changing into a DANK suit of armor
[2:50:13] <luftraumm1> is it because of the access?
[2:50:14] <%Ranryu692> @DancesWitBalrog peach forbade talking about that
[2:50:18] <leinadtonu> What's the difference between a summer dress and a fall dress? the fabric?
[2:50:24] <DancesWitBalrog> @ranryu692 oh sorry
[2:50:27] <brachydios777> No talks about you know who
[2:50:31] <luftraumm1> length?
[2:50:38] <%Ranryu692> I thought you did? I'
[2:50:39] <%Ranryu692> m sorry
[2:50:40] <%optimasmaximas> oh god
[2:50:41] <benjiFG> speen
[2:50:41] <$Puhff> Ii forbid it
[2:50:44] <mr_saturday93> Just don't....
[2:50:45] <brachydios777> Oh
[2:50:49] <peachy996> The plot thickens and grows more uncomfortable
[2:50:52] <DancesWitBalrog> I just heard about the news 30 minutes ago
[2:50:56] <afronooch> id rather not have twitch chats opinion on it tbh
[2:50:57] <%Sick_Haystacks> the saga is ongoing
[2:50:59] <valerios_> pls no
[2:50:59] <%ItsRatman> Probably better not to discuss it
[2:51:01] <peachy996> There's not much to say other than "Oof!'
[2:51:03] <perfect_disaster> still lets not
[2:51:06] <@PatStaresAt> @PeachSaliva So the camera on this part sucks, basically the birds head is on the floor when Nameless is swinging
[2:51:07] <mr_saturday93> The cringe... is too much and I live too close to that person
[2:51:07] <%mikehuntis4timmy> its pretty fucked
[2:51:08] <%Major_Lee_> Prison Saga begins now
[2:51:08] <islandsunn> mad man's knowledge
[2:51:09] <@SoFarFetched> yeah or else twitch chat would be nothing but it.
[2:51:09] <Ravioli_Ronin> Naaaaaaaah im good NotLikeThis NotLikeThis NotLikeThis
[2:51:09] <HeroToxiko> Too shakesperean
[2:51:14] <%Jack_of_No_Trades> is this something I don;t want to know? Who;s Christian?
[2:51:17] <brachydios777> The story causes Frenzy
[2:51:17] <%pokefan9956> do you guys still have her can lol
[2:51:21] <+Gondab> @Monkeyweed21 Eldin Ring boss fight where your beaten to death with your own horse.
[2:51:22] <@SoFarFetched> It was probably because I was deleting the messages last time.
[2:51:22] <%femto216> Who?
[2:51:27] <%geekjacob> who?
[2:51:29] <+RickyJZ> @Jack_of_No_Trades You don't want to know
[2:51:29] <@SoFarFetched> which they thought YOU banned it
[2:51:30] <+barrakuta371> @jack_of_no_trades Better you not know
[2:51:34] <peachy996> @Jack_of_No_Trades Don't worry about it
[2:51:34] <+glescoron> Don't look up Chris chan I'm begging you all
[2:51:41] <%Jack_of_No_Trades> Got it
[2:51:42] <peachy996> You are all better off not knowing
[2:51:48] <brachydios777> Its best not knowing
[2:51:50] <@PatStaresAt> Do yourself all a huge favour and dodge that nightmare
[2:51:52] <@SoFarFetched> Yeah its more I was saving Chat's mind.
[2:51:57] <@SoFarFetched> cause I rather just d elete the messages
[2:51:57] <%FacetiousAF> sensitive nature
[2:52:00] <Ravioli_Ronin> Not knowing is best for public safety
[2:52:00] <%Sick_Haystacks> It's almost not worth thinking about
[2:52:02] <%geekjacob> oh the thing
[2:52:02] <@Jekado> its a slippery slope is why
[2:52:05] <%patriotrenegade> the visceral horror
[2:52:06] <valerios_> i mean chat was being primo chat the other day, makes sense
[2:52:09] <%ItsRatman> Telling people not to look it up makes them look it up. You cant win!
[2:52:11] <%optimasmaximas> its pretty bad i dont balme her for deleting the messages
[2:52:12] <Jetsfantasy> Far fetched was being a bro
[2:52:13] <%YakumoYomi> Too late for me, Pat
[2:52:18] <+ThomasOfTroy> @SoFarFetched And we appreciate it
[2:52:18] <+barrakuta371> I wish I could unlearn it. Thanks Yahoo News for giving me a forced headline
[2:52:21] <peachy996> @PatStaresAt Benoit the Nightmare away.
[2:52:23] <DancesWitBalrog> @sofarfetched sorry about that
[2:52:31] <perfect_disaster> lets talk about prime ministers and black face
[2:52:33] <brachydios777> ye
[2:52:35] <%geekjacob> yeah pat its too late for me i already know
[2:52:35] <Coystick> Reminds me of OG Demon's Souls OST
[2:52:36] <afronooch> lol
[2:52:37] <+aslfrasle> As an adherent of the Eye, I had to know.
[2:52:37] <%SuckerPunchSyd> Twist his dick Paige!
[2:52:38] <thunka10> no :)
[2:52:41] <Eightesu> will we be hearing it alot?
[2:52:49] <%Ranryu692> @SoFarFetched yeah, it was the combo of you deleting the messages and Paige saying she didn't want to talk about it, I added them up when I shouldn't have LUL
[2:52:54] <+SenorCounter> Give him the old dick Twist!
[2:52:56] <%YakumoYomi> It's not Tuesday, so no dick twisting
[2:53:02] <yourliteraldog> yeah racist heads of state is better topic.
[2:53:06] <%Agami23> the way the dragon looks reminds me of bloodborne.
[2:53:09] <islandsunn> ok that was bullshit
[2:53:20] <%MechArch> yeyeyeye
[2:53:25] <%pokefan9956> so what's next in terms of longer games after dark souls 3?
[2:53:25] <@PatStaresAt> WOW
[2:53:27] <%Sick_Haystacks> right in its stupid beak
[2:53:28] <+ThomasOfTroy> Nice dogde
[2:53:29] <peachy996> I like the how the lock on visual for the dragon makes it look like it has a glowing eye
[2:53:29] <+SenorCounter> wow nice
[2:53:30] <valerios_> what
[2:53:30] <%pokefan9956> nioh maybe?

[2:53:33] <@SoFarFetched> @Ranryu692 nah its all good LUL I was also being pretty quick because I was remembering in Pat's chat I was deleting a couple messages too cause people were like "HEY CHRIS CHAN"
[2:53:35] <brachydios777> wowy
[2:53:35] <MyNameIsRasus> WHAT A ROLL

[2:53:41] <DancesWitBalrog> so close
[2:53:43] <@PatStaresAt> @PeachSaliva Paige you can't just swing 5 times
[2:53:45] <%pokefan9956> Paige playing nioh would be interesting
[2:53:46] <%femto216> Oww
[2:53:48] <BigYanno> the delay on his attacks is murder
[2:53:48] <peachy996> bonk the head
[2:53:49] <%FacetiousAF> MASHed potatoes
[2:53:53] <%Agami23> this fight made my bow using ass feel very justified
[2:53:57] <%Monkeyweed21> why is Woolie playing the game
[2:53:59] <peachy996> that's all you gotta do herer
[2:54:00] <@Jekado> @PatStaresAt Sooo... 6 times?

[2:54:04] <%CptCreampuff16> does this hammer have any overhead swings?
[2:54:04] <leinadtonu> no 5 swings, try 6 swings
[2:54:11] <DancesWitBalrog> @eightesu that was the very first game she played and beat on this channel
[2:54:12] <valerios_> LUL
[2:54:15] <MyNameIsRasus> LUL
[2:54:15] <%That1blindkid> I would love to see her go back to Bloodborne when she finishes all of these
[2:54:15] <%ItsRatman> LUL LUL LUL
[2:54:16] <@PatStaresAt> Oh the game has a weird input delay, sometimes when you mash it 5 times it'll do those 5 times no matter what else you press

[2:57:02] <BigYanno> I haven't fought this boss in years, but I fought him so many times just trying to beat him that I still remember his patterns. Can't remember my age half the time but I remember the patterns of a dark souls boss
[2:57:05] <perfect_disaster> yep
[2:57:07] <@PatStaresAt> This guy is definitely a 1 hit and roll dude
[2:57:09] <rudiciuscaesar> keep your distance for a bit.
[2:57:09] <MyNameIsRasus> chimken avenged
[2:57:11] <valerios_> he does not like an ass hugger
[2:57:15] <%That1blindkid> The problem is he delays his attacks and punishes panic rolling
[2:57:16] <rudiciuscaesar> no no no, Paige, you can do it.
[2:57:17] <@commanderclaw> Ganbatte Paige Kun!
[2:57:19] <@SoFarFetched> @MyNameIsRasus geefGasp I died?
