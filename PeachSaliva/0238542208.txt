[0:02:33] <%umbypokochan> she*
[0:02:37] <+TerraBranfordStrife> what kind of run is she doing?
[0:02:39] <ancrest_tant> @zucchinibread that insinuates that she could see
[0:02:39] <+ChaosVulpes> And yet she won PUBG on like her second time playing...
[0:02:45] <MarylandJutsu> @TerraBranfordStrife blind run
[0:02:46] <suikudo> irrelevant
[0:02:46] <@Moobot> Do you have a Fanfiction for Paige to read? Submit it to us here and it may get read on stream! http://bit.ly/2jsxJo9

[0:02:52] <%hawk_rush> LUL
[0:02:55] <AncelDeLambert> Peach is unwittingly doing a Pacifist run
[0:02:56] <zucchinibread> paigeBlind
[0:02:56] <Sochin_Iitsu> Every run is a blind run with Paige
[0:02:57] <TheInkshow> PUBG dont have puzzles
[0:02:57] <+xijiy> @TerraBranfordStrife Shes just playing the game
[0:03:03] <+patriotrenegade> Paige playing Undertale makes me think Bloodborne was a fluke
[0:03:07] <%Ultimaman123> @PeachSaliva Talk to everything, but kill if necessary
[0:03:08] <%ZebraFace> Shes a pacifist rn
[0:03:09] <+Ches_Neckbeard> @TerraBranfordStrife totally blind just like Peach herself
[0:03:10] <+Aggro_Will> I'm gonna fuckng say it. Muffins aren't cakes.
[0:03:13] <UnregisteredOffender> Mic muted and WcDonald's either already there or on the way
[0:03:14] <Sochin_Iitsu> Bloodborne was a fluke
[0:03:16] <%breakfastmegapowers> Guys NO SPOILERS!!!
[0:03:16] <%TheOnlyStrayCat> @hawk_rush You're on.
[0:03:19] <AncelDeLambert> Muffins are fucking cakes
[0:03:24] <TheInkshow> muted mic here we go
[0:03:25] <%umbypokochan> bloodborne is easier for paige because she is bloodthirtsy killer
[0:03:25] <+Aggro_Will> They're not iced and are served for breakfast!
[0:03:26] <+Ches_Neckbeard> Pie is cake!
[0:03:28] <+Aggro_Will> They';re QUICKBREADS.
[0:03:28] <+BoboDaHobo> She's really good at games but she gets freaked out easily and loses all capability, if she stays calm she is big strong
[0:03:29] <DapperHatwell> Muffins are bald cupcakes
[0:03:32] <888deathkid888> i just relized the majority of charaters are female
[0:03:36] <+xijiy> Hopefully you all aren't ruining the game for her on twitter
[0:03:36] <$Ultradoom333> Muffins are delicious
[0:03:39] <+WorldSoup5> !muffindebate
[0:03:40] <@Moobot> Did you just say muffins aren't cakes WorldSoup5?!
[0:03:40] <thelonechris> Hopefully Paige doesn't get WcDonald's worms during the stream
[0:03:42] <+ChaosVulpes> Muffins aren't cakes. They aren't iced so therefore are not cakes. No icing, no cake. Now a cupcake is a cake...
[0:03:43] <@Moobot> I must have misheard you WorldSoup5 I'll let this slide...for now.
[0:03:43] <Fujiwara_92> kill everything, but talk if necessary Kappa
[0:03:43] <Shade075> YEYEYEY in time!
[0:03:51] <denam_of_windscale> Mustard can never serve as a full meal CHANGE MY MIND
[0:03:54] <+Aggro_Will> A cupcake is totally a cake.
[0:03:54] <+miyoles> MURDER PARTY!
[0:03:54] <AncelDeLambert> I hate to say this, but if you've never played this game before, and want to stay away from spoilers, turn off the chat
[0:04:00] <Twoiis> long intro is long
[0:04:00] <%A1Cartwood> Intro loop
[0:04:02] <AMajorTom> forget muffins. Is cornbread really bread?
[0:04:02] <LordLicoriceDerp> Best advice for her is DO NOT LOOK AT CHAT
[0:04:03] <+Aggro_Will> But a PANCAKE isn't, we can agree?
[0:04:05] <SchroedingersFerret> Liam laming it out against Sephiroth right now.
[0:04:08] <Mornaka> someone last week said layer cakes are sandwiches
[0:04:09] <TheInkshow> !fuckboivin is reading
[0:04:09] <+Aggro_Will> Cornbread is ALSO quickbread.
[0:04:11] <%breakfastmegapowers> #GetBanned for #Spoilers
[0:04:12] <+Aggro_Will> Proof: CORNBREAD MUFFINS
[0:04:12] <%TheOnlyStrayCat> @hawk_rush I'll take that bet, I say $5 it's all on.
[0:04:13] <suikudo> this intro is cool but it loops like shit
[0:04:14] <Hawkbone_> Pancakes are cake.
[0:04:22] <+YZYMANDIAS> pancakes are cake
[0:04:22] <+Ches_Neckbeard> Pat took the chat away from Paige also don't spoiler and let Paige be blind
[0:04:29] <jrsanchez93> Cupcakes are totally cake, Muffins aren't though.
[0:04:32] <Fujiwara_92> she won't look at the chat guys, Pat's gonna make sure of that OpieOP
[0:04:32] <Captain_Joe1911> atpLook \ :) @PeachSaliva
[0:04:35] <Aeogard> @SchroedingersFerret how's he doing? I planned on watching the vod later
[0:04:36] <AMajorTom> So then, cake is bread?
[0:04:40] <Sochin_Iitsu> pancakes are dogshit. Just like muffins and regular cake
[0:04:41] <AncelDeLambert> FUCK YOU, FLOWEY!
[0:04:41] <TheInkshow> Pat tell her she missed a boss
[0:04:41] <+YZYMANDIAS> bread is cake
[0:04:42] <%hawk_rush> @TheOnlyStrayCat But it's imaginary $5, 'cause I be broke rn
[0:04:43] <grayjammer> @AncelDeLambert Peach isnt looking at Chat. Pat is serving as a spoiler-free medium in case stuff goes wrong
[0:04:43] <+ChaosVulpes> What type of cornbread? Are you talking the fluffy sweet type of cornbread or the thin, crunchy, salty kind?
[0:04:44] <Parkerthomas> Caked have frosting on them. Therefore muffins arent cakes. However if you put frosting on a muffin then iy becomes a cupcake.
[0:04:44] <thelonechris> LMAO
[0:04:44] <UnregisteredOffender> Oh lord
[0:04:45] <waterstealer> remember when paige ate a snowman right in front of him

[2:26:45] <tomokocchi_> don't walk into the blue circles
[2:26:46] <Louie_Salmon> Paige knows you guys, she's super big and cool
[2:26:46] <MainMan_Jonadiah> @AncelDeLambert She literally has infinite healing items now, haha.

[2:26:48] <+CrimsonCore90> How...just How?
[2:26:49] <+SkaNinja> don't lose hope
[2:26:51] <Valkyrjsen> She beat Orphan of Kos.
[2:26:52] <+TeethMuncher> Paige vs The World
[2:26:54] <Hawkbone_> "There was nothing i could do, Pat!"
[2:26:54] <Elexius> "Maybe Undyne won't hurt me if I stand completely still."
[2:26:55] <DesmondtheOrc> STRONG AS FUCK
[2:26:56] <+ChaosVulpes> Don't step on the landmines Paige!
[2:26:56] <elementofloyalty> Where's the support?
[2:26:56] <+coolthulhuu> with big sword
[2:26:56] <%TenaciousLeeOfficial> !hooker
[2:26:57] <@Moobot> It has been 0 Days 0 Hours 0 Minutes since last being mistaken for a hooker.
[2:26:57] <megamonmon123> @WoolyFish broken clock is right twice a day i guess
[2:26:59] <AncelDeLambert> well, only if she rolls a salad
[2:27:01] <Sochin_Iitsu> Bloodborne was a fluke
[2:27:05] <goose_attack_almanac> Paige VS Emerald Splash
[2:27:09] <+StencilOST> Hint look at the bottom path to solve the maze
[2:27:10] <%TenaciousLeeOfficial> It has to have been the biggest fluke
[2:27:11] <subjectg> KURAE
[2:27:12] <darklordnoir> Good ol' Peach
[2:27:13] <seriousseen> Man pat is lucky she sucks so much
[2:27:14] <+AcidicHorizon> Undertale > Orphan of kos
[2:27:15] <$evermoore_hex> She beat Ebriatas in a MINUTE
[2:27:19] <%finaltrinity5> That's such a good way to intorduce the sequence, honestly
[2:27:22] <$FoxInABeret> Yeah, weapon triangle says spears beat swords.
[2:27:23] <+NiktenKing> To be fair... at least this is harder than her spear throws
[2:27:24] <fireking900> bloodborne was the biggest lie ever told
[2:27:28] <goose_attack_almanac> @PeachSaliva Ruby Weapon vs Emerald Splash
[2:27:28] <alextrebeken> strength build carried her in all games
[2:27:28] <@WoolyFish> ??????
[2:27:28] <stigna1> Undertale is the Bloodborne of video games, to be fair.
[2:27:29] <megamonmon123> @TenaciousLeeOfficial are we asking for a bloodborne recount?
[2:27:29] <@Moobot> Do you have a Fanfiction for Paige to read? Submit it to us here and it may get read on stream! http://bit.ly/2jsxJo9

[2:27:44] <goose_attack_almanac> @MikeyxStyles there it is
[2:27:45] <On_Target> Nah, Paige is just reverse skillful. She beat Bloodborne no problem but would cause the computer to explode if she played Burn the Rope
