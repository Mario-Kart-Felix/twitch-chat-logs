[0:32:41] <%zorak100229> It‚Äôs hell here
[0:32:44] <+terraspan> So not the single dose?
[0:32:45] <%Ranryu692> aw yeah, get that adderall too @PeachSaliva
[0:32:45] <marvel877> 3-4 weeks.
[0:32:45] <%Marg0Pol0> Pfizer is the 2 week one
[0:32:45] <+CelticFrost70> its a trap dont come here
[0:32:45] <%chance_h> Isn‚Äôt the boarder closed?
[0:32:45] <%hewlettfan96> It‚Äôs Like Fury Road down there

[0:32:50] <%walternatorz> you can do that now
[0:32:51] <$cade_calrayn> yeah it's 3 and then you wait a few days for the second effects
[0:32:51] <muniea5> it's two shots though, right?
[0:32:52] <TheAntiNihilist> isnt that near Chicago. sounds like a bad idea
[0:32:53] <+Ches_Neckbeard> 3-4 weeks for the 2nd shot then 2 more weeks for immunity

[0:32:59] <xXjuffelXx> How long is that trip
[0:32:59] <%VexicBayn> 3 weeks for pfizer
[0:32:59] <@SoFarFetched> Think it would be safer to just do the shot and personal business.
[0:33:00] <Ziegsy> Shes heading through the C.U.M. zone
[0:33:00] <MarylandJutsu> 3-4 weeks ish
[0:33:00] <$Sphincter_Spelunker> when is the last time you driven a long distance? rip back
[0:33:01] <NoHoldsBarredProductions> Some places are separating the shots by like three months.
[0:33:03] <afronooch> j&j is one shot
[0:33:04] <marvel877> Mom's was 3 weeks, Dad's is 4.
[0:33:04] <%Jack_of_No_Trades> Have him vaccinate before you do so you can bother him

[0:48:05] <%JZPotter> @PeachSaliva It's an old song. It was in Lost in Translation

I couldn't afford an ergo chair, but I bought one that fits my body well, has the cushioning I like and is made of decent materials. I've been able to sit for hours in comfort for the first time in my life!

[1:10:25] <%g0atmeal> Was it Sonic themed?
[1:10:26] <Varrens> This sounds more and more like a Big Bang Theory wedding by the second
[1:10:27] <+ennui_on_me> life dropped an epic husband,
[1:10:28] <$StaceMcGate> @PeachSaliva not even a dance to Death by Glamour?
[1:10:31] <Jaysky> Have your wedding your way please.
[1:10:33] <%worldbrand> it's a bit Much
[1:10:33] <+waltzqueen> MMMMMM
[1:10:35] <%walternatorz> the wedding still should be about the couple
[1:10:39] <+RealThiele> shes trying so hard not to shit on them LUL
[1:10:44] <TakingLifesL> napkins and cake topper stuff that works for
[1:10:45] <Tracazoid> So no Sonic fanfic readings?
[1:10:50] <%blastyoboots> Cringetastic
[1:10:50] <$TIME_PUNCHER> I've seen Mario themed wedding, whatever floats your goat I guess
[1:10:52] <rosencruez> First Dance to BoneTrousle
[1:10:52] <Jaysky> Put a skeleton in the corner
[1:10:55] <%Campfire_Chronicles> kids call it 'cringe' i believe
[1:10:56] <$hrbeck_> Is your first dance gonna be Megalomania or not!?
[1:10:58] <aeravon> I did that
[1:10:58] <%AncelDeLambert> "tacky", the word you're looking for is "tacky
[1:11:00] <JustYudha> Just say tacky lol
[1:11:00] <Meekest> The tasteful Sans tie
[1:11:01] <aeravon> Dont do it
[1:11:02] <%Jack_of_No_Trades> subtle 30 foot tall Papyrus at the alter
[1:11:03] <lloyddboy> skelmo's not gonna be the minister???
[1:11:04] <+waltzqueen> Tacky
[1:11:05] <+shad8snake> a lil something is fine, but being completely themed is a bit much
[1:11:06] <Wiiplayah43> nerrrrrrrrrd. jk
[1:11:12] <Coystick> Prelude
[1:11:15] <%walternatorz> is Pat in chat to take notes?
[1:11:15] <jetpack_rorschasch> Yeah, keep it a little more classy than cringy. SeemsGood
[1:11:20] <alliedmastercompy> Red Wing Theme from the beginning of the game.
[1:11:20] <theCrowRunner> Like more subtlety?
[1:11:22] <tacostarvedbeast> So the brides maids won‚Äôt be wearing ‚Äúget smoked‚Äù hats got it
[1:11:23] <%maskofmichael> Play Spooky Scary Skeletons
[1:11:24] <+waltzqueen> the theme might not be that bad tbqh
[1:11:24] <Djinnazz> Just lie to them.
[1:11:25] <Ravioli_Ronin> Secret nerd stuff
[1:11:30] <aeravon> We had tables named for the nations of FFXI. seriously, dont do it
[1:11:32] <OneThousandTomatoes> people who dont know it can still apreciate
[1:11:37] <blackbookalpha> I remember filming a wedding and the couple's dance was FF8's Eyes On Me
[1:11:42] <MetroidSlayerP7> THink of the inlaws and grandpas
[1:11:45] <critiquequartz> you put anything on a cello it sounds like classical music
[1:11:46] <Wiiplayah43> @aeravon damn that's extra
[1:11:47] <Coystick> Walk down the aisle to Cleric Beast theme
[1:11:47] <%blastyoboots> Do that, it‚Äôs subtle enough!
[1:11:48] <$TIME_PUNCHER> Pat has to learn to dance for the wedding dance
[1:11:52] <+shruke> Like a t-shirt with a design that only sticks out if you know it
[1:11:59] <$Sphincter_Spelunker> Get you some Akatsuki robes for a wedding
[1:12:00] <Jaysky> So basically you're saying you want something subtle like a tshirt with an obscure reference of a game as opposed to a game box art on a tshirt
[1:12:00] <critiquequartz> or organ
[1:12:02] <Varrens> Okay eyes on me is a good pick
[1:12:02] <ammobasket> you woulda gone a different way

[1:12:20] <deafmutelaughing> Pat will be too busy playing fortnite
[1:12:20] <bispearl> howl moving castle theme to dance to
[1:12:22] <%Campfire_Chronicles> the FF7R song Hollow is super nice to listen to in any context
[1:12:23] <%skyentombment> You should make your first song be a Banjo Kazooie song

[1:12:28] <+waltzqueen> @bispearl yes

[1:21:39] <+RealThiele> plug manscaped
[1:21:43] <TheLemuroid> I popped into Arcadum's work stream the other day and there was an intimidating list of potential players
[1:21:51] <TheLemuroid> You were in it
[1:21:55] <Dazko_> FACE REVEAL
[1:21:59] <@SoFarFetched> @PlagueOfGripes you having fun with AU Pat & paige?
[1:22:01] <Finakala> Arcadum's upcoming vtuber d&d is going to be amazing
[1:22:10] <%BoxNavy> me :)
[1:22:10] <$Sphincter_Spelunker> no spoilers
[1:22:11] <$Agami23> list of potential players
[1:22:11] <$AzureGale> Always be yourself. Unless you can be Elmo. Then be Elmo.
[1:22:15] <OneThousandTomatoes> its weird that both nyanners and sajam already agreed to play with arcadum
[1:22:16] <dabeaminator> List? What list?
[1:22:23] <%sonlascivious> sonlascivious subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 6 months, currently on a 1 month streak! Can't believe I've been subbed for so long but it's the least I can do for my favorite mustard queen!
[1:22:24] <$Agami23> not in a group. if you DM him you can see about getting in with ross
[1:22:25] <@PlagueOfGripes> no idea what you're talking about
[1:22:26] <@SoFarFetched> Arcadum made a list of group DnD sessions
[1:22:38] <@SoFarFetched> and paige was listed as a potential for a group
[1:22:39] <+mugwugsampoo> üìú ‚úçÔ∏è cmonBruh
[1:22:56] <jorniev> maaaaaan i would totally watch her play DnD
[1:22:56] <%Campfire_Chronicles> ooh Paige and Ross would be the start of a great dnd party
[1:23:04] <%chance_h> Put battery in fridge and camera in oven
[1:23:08] <@SoFarFetched> Cause Arcadum needs the confirmation if you're okay with the group and can do it.
[1:23:14] <Varrens> Oh rad! do they know what they're running or has it not been decided?
[1:23:15] <$Sphincter_Spelunker> Paige cannot be a Necromancer, it is forbidden
[1:23:18] <$Agami23> he is trying to figure out how to group people up. but he has planned players for the first 5 campaigns. including one with peachjars
[1:23:19] <%sumrand0> Vtube aka the death of art.....jk luv Korone, hard not to.
[1:23:26] <Wiiplayah43> @Campfire_Chronicles this is a collab I never knew I needed

[1:23:53] <Finakala> The mustard's always been green
[1:23:54] <+AngriestAngryArtist> because I'm about to lariat my new 32" monitor LOL!

[2:06:17] <+cafefunk> Dont worry about your rambling, i like hearing whats going on with your life LuvSign
[2:06:22] <ChungusQuest> Drifting Elmo particles were very visible in this camera setup.  It's pretty hilarious
[2:06:26] <+radda343> he is a king MercyWing1 psaPorgmo MercyWing2
[2:06:42] <$Sphincter_Spelunker> @Darkfire346 Montana is beautiful, I have some family who lived there for a time. The only thing they missed was some food and the beach
[2:06:54] <Foaminghammer> hell yeah brother
[2:06:57] <@SoFarFetched> @Sotetsu Well thats good to hear geefHug and yeah I accidentally do that as killer sometimes too.
[2:07:02] <MarylandJutsu> Paige is multifaceted
[2:07:06] <@SoFarFetched> I try to be fair as killer when I can.
[2:07:16] <%Paralurx> Paralurx subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 21 months! Oh look, Paige has bee banished from the sex dungeon and must stream from elsewhere
[2:07:17] <%ShootThatZombie> did you ever get around to posting a photo of your setup?
[2:07:49] <Darkfire346> @Sphincter_Spelunker i just want to legit live away from society so I can choose when I want to be around people. i hate neighbors.
[2:07:50] <joso_grando> hold up a boombox
[2:07:59] <WanderingYoren> *Eli fence joke goes here*
[2:08:07] <%arcaderabbit48> Like some short, ginger, Slender Man
[2:08:09] <$Agami23> dress like a ghost and look longingly at them from the distance so if they walk by a window they can catch a glimpse of you
[2:08:09] <$cade_calrayn> and he has nice feet
[2:08:15] <ChungusQuest> oh man, Kentucky is in that area with the 50ft white crosses all down the highways.  So creepy.
[2:08:15] <Darkfire346> beep beep
[2:08:16] <%czeekytv> Are DBD queues always this long? o.O
[2:08:17] <%samazonsky> beep beep
[2:08:42] <$Sphincter_Spelunker> @Darkfire346 Be sure to check taxes and such. Some states might be deceptively cheap to live with a caveat
[2:08:45] <MarylandJutsu> byeee emlo
[2:08:49] <@SoFarFetched> @czeekytv survivor queues are longer because more people play survivor,but when you play killer you get into faster queues.
[2:08:50] <%maskofmichael> based on time of day too
[2:08:53] <WanderingYoren> I would think more people would want to play killer more than survivors?
[2:08:54] <%arcaderabbit48> Oh hey, I live in Kentucky! Its not great
[2:08:58] <WanderingYoren> how strange
[2:08:58] <+razielhex> @czeekytv Game is almost 5 years old.
[2:09:08] <SulfurousAcid> survivor queue tends to get bad at around 6pm central
[2:09:11] <@PlagueOfGripes> I forgot how I set up my DbD macros, but I did some sort of fucking magic where my macro is set to the comma key and my interact button is my CTRL key, but when I use my mouse it makes the interact button a toggle (???)
[2:09:12] <%czeekytv> Ah it's the ol healer vs dps queue times lol
[2:09:14] <MackFighters> there's a massive update this week too!
[2:09:16] <%ospreyworks> More than you'd expect, less than you'd hope
[2:09:18] <Darkfire346> DBD IS 5 YEARS OLD?!
[2:09:21] <$sekoshi> Best time to play is during midday weekday for survivor
[2:09:23] <%ospreyworks> It is a fun game
[2:09:26] <tacostarvedbeast> What killer has the cutest butt?
[2:09:27] <+razielhex> @Darkfire346 Uhh, June 2016
[2:09:31] <T_Sasquatch> its been 5 years .... fuck
[2:09:33] <clockworknait1> hoping for a ps5 dbd upgrade
[2:09:33] <Darkfire346> WTF
[2:09:38] <WanderingYoren> 30k on steam charts atm, that's pretty sizeable
[2:09:38] <@SoFarFetched> yeah 5th anniversary event should be coming up in May
[2:09:52] <jorniev> feeling sleeepy GOODBYE PAIGE
[2:10:00] <@PlagueOfGripes> no it's what it should be, I just don't remember what I did
[2:10:01] <%king_wragles> Oh ya, changing the struggle button to mouse wheel down will make your life super easy, Paige
[2:10:05] <jorniev> have fun
[2:10:06] <Darkfire346> Oldest game i still play is CounterStrike:Source and its older than some of yuou guys
[2:10:14] <+JonWhoLovesFlatWomen> time for balls in ass?
[2:10:16] <@SoFarFetched> and tommorow they are releasing a new Killer/Survivor
[2:10:31] <%czeekytv> Is killer just not as fun to play in this game?
[2:10:35] <+razielhex> slappa da space
[2:10:39] <%czeekytv> So people don't queue as it?
[2:10:39] <%bevyrage> just put crouch to toggle and set it to ctrl
[2:10:51] <$thomassolorio> BUFF EDDIE
[2:10:53] <%king_wragles> I mean if it's comfy lol
[2:10:54] <+Bail_Seven> PEDDALS?
[2:11:03] <+razielhex> man, I don't take this long to get a Vermintide II match
[2:11:07] <@SoFarFetched> @czeekytv Killer can be fun,this is just one of those games when the community can be toxic. Survivors tend to be more toxic to the killer. But Killers themselves can also be toxic in their playstyle.
[2:11:10] <@PlagueOfGripes> why don't you queue THEN talk
[2:11:11] <%samazonsky> It's okay we enjoy your company.
[2:11:13] <%king_wragles> There aren't enough killers imo
[2:11:15] <$Sphincter_Spelunker> Fortnite would have queued already
[2:11:25] <@SoFarFetched> Since some people have said they avoid killer cause they're not good and dont wanna deal with toxic survivors.
[2:11:26] <%king_wragles> Killer players I mean
[2:11:32] <%EyeFarted> @PeachSaliva Just play some DS3 while you wait?
[2:11:41] <+strakillias> Hey Paige, do your hands ever start aching when you use a controller? Like after only 10 minutes.
[2:11:44] <+alternative_flu> Honestly this stream has been pretty zen to me
[2:11:46] <%BoxNavy> its nice :)
[2:11:46] <@PlagueOfGripes> we don't
[2:11:48] <+razielhex> damn it MEG
[2:11:48] <%czeekytv> Can't pause DS3 Kappa
[2:11:52] <%arcaderabbit48> @czeekytv Playing Killer is really stressful, because of the responsibility. You set the pace of the game, you're the primary threat, and you're 1v4. Same reason why a lot of people don't play Tank in MMOs. All eyes are on you
[2:11:58] <Ravioli_Ronin> Hunt Pat in fortnite
[2:12:01] <%Ranryu692> it's either this or be alone, so...
[2:12:01] <%Wiiplayah43> @peachsaliva it's what we're here for, lol
[2:12:03] <@SoFarFetched> Paige accidentally does the death grip with her controllers which causes it to hurt more.
[2:12:07] <+cafefunk> Youre so mean to yourself LUL
[2:12:09] <ChungusQuest> Dwight and his harem LUL

[2:12:26] <@SoFarFetched> The brain is a weird thing.
[2:12:32] <@SoFarFetched> we say mean things to ourselves
[2:12:33] <%EyeFarted> I had to coming
[2:12:37] <@SoFarFetched> but we go "damn I'd fuck me"
[2:12:40] <$thomassolorio> you know we love it
[2:12:40] <%czeekytv> I like playing tank in MMOs so I guess I just don't get it lol
[2:12:40] <%EyeFarted> *it
[2:12:53] <T_Sasquatch> i think rsi gloves are a thing
[2:12:56] <+strakillias> Just asking bout the hands cause I got "who knows lol" as the result for a lupus test
[2:13:01] <+psydaku> cant relate SFF.
[2:13:10] <@SoFarFetched> @czeekytv I say DbD is a different mindset.cause some survivors try to tilt killers by teabagging a lot (with the crouch command)
[2:13:16] <$thomassolorio> need a humidifier up in this bish
[2:13:35] <%king_wragles> If you don't like tbagging survivors, play Huntress or Deathslinger lol
[2:13:37] <+razielhex> Dr. House turning in his grave
[2:13:38] <%Kenzo2000> Pat sucks the moisture off like one of those fish that sticks to the tank
[2:13:42] <Arancet> fulla lupus
[2:13:42] <%czeekytv> Ah that kind of toxic. And if matches drag on I can see it being not very fun

[2:14:48] <+someyounguy1> you are the novel gone girl
[2:14:48] <@SoFarFetched> @czeekytv yeah pretty much. There can also be meta builds which can make newbie survivors have a hard time with veterans. Also if survivors are really good at looping the killer it can frustrate the killer.
[2:14:49] <%DiscoMatador> Black cube has Devoured Paige
[2:14:50] <Zaphire_Saucypants> I'd say just give up on it for this session

[2:33:06] <%AncelDeLambert> see, ya don't camp because it cedes generator progress to the survivors so SUCK IT, KILLER
[2:33:24] <@SoFarFetched> Yeah camping gives less points,so I never know why they still go for it.
[2:33:26] <CandyCoatedConfection> @sofarfetched I guess she just doesn't want scratch marks then. ok
[2:33:30] <@SoFarFetched> cause you want more hooks for more points
[2:33:44] <+Kinoskae> She might be running Whispers

[2:39:38] <dots4eyes> Pat might know
[2:39:39] <ExileNineteen> don't camp, don't tunnel, if you notice a weaker survivor let them be
[2:39:44] <Zeif00> Survival Rulebook

[2:40:08] <+angelnickl> Pat does the big killer time.
[2:40:12] <$thomassolorio> pats a super villan
[2:40:18] <+GalacticaPhanto> I think he mentioned a good amount of tips in his DbD VODs
[2:40:22] <dots4eyes> Pat might might just say to dunk on the newer player
[2:40:23] <Kaleidoscope_Misfortune> nothing really someone will always be mad atleast thats my thinking
[2:40:26] <ExileNineteen> @Sotetsu i'm grinding for r1 surv rn, can you tell these bubbas and slingers that
[2:40:26] <$TIME_PUNCHER> DbD can be like sleeping in the woods in England. lots of teabags and camping
[2:40:31] <$Agami23> have fun. hide right behind a survivor if they dont notice you so that you jumpscare them
[2:40:32] <%TigerCatGo> Yo, a live stream, sweet!!
[2:40:32] <+iceballstwitch> people will say "dont camp or tunnel" and then 3 will crowd every hook
[2:40:32] <%CantWalkGood> I hate it when people tea bag
[2:40:38] <@SoFarFetched> I try to let newbie survivors go but they keep running away when I try to give them hatch geefJames
[2:40:53] <$thomassolorio> just say bitch alot and be overtly sexual
[2:40:54] <Shacklebox> No kick that child's ass so hard they never want to play again
[2:40:55] <Sotetsu> @exilenineteen I hope I never get to red ranks, it sounds miserable.
[2:41:06] <%maskofmichael> do you use forever freddy?
[2:41:14] <$Sphincter_Spelunker> yeah, gatekeep those children
[2:41:15] <@SoFarFetched> I try to give hatch when the teammates are bad.
[2:41:16] <Joem1k> you should try out hunt showdown
[2:41:19] <+angelnickl> I only played huntress as killer but people kept rage quitting on me.
[2:41:27] <Sotetsu> I've been playing pig, and everyone seems to have pig.
[2:41:28] <+alternative_flu> do them kids dirty paige
[2:41:31] <extradopeness> What‚Äôs up Paige!
[2:41:34] <Sotetsu> *hate pig
[2:41:35] <MackFighters> pat's too busy beating up kids on fortnite now
[2:41:36] <Shacklebox> well you're high level now
[2:41:37] <@SoFarFetched> cause sometimes y ou get those survivors who think more for themselves.
[2:41:39] <@SoFarFetched> and not help.
[2:41:41] <mr_saturday93> I rarely do that unless the player was cool
[2:41:42] <$Agami23> be toxic like pat where you type in "i clapped when i saw it" when you win
[2:41:46] <pleasedontyelle> People are really sweaty now. Especially after the 13th of each month (rank reset).
[2:41:47] <BackflipCharm> Nice to see you streaming again. That chair must be some kind of magical.
[2:41:47] <%PrincessAlex23> Playing killer, I always try to do as good as I can.  If I'm scrubbing it up, how are the survivors going to have any fun?
[2:41:53] <@SoFarFetched> and y ou're like "guys...they are on first hook and already almost dead  geefBruh "
[2:42:00] <%king_wragles> Hatch is only for those who earned it! ONLY THE STRONG SHALL SURVIVE! RRRAAAAAA
[2:42:14] <$Sphincter_Spelunker> Bean dad the hatch
[2:42:35] <@SoFarFetched> @PrincessAlex23 I try to observe survivors to see how they react when  being chased/hiding. Cause then you start seeing patterns on how certain players run from you. Its always a learning experience.
[2:42:38] <Sotetsu> I need practice counting hooks and and telling survivor apart so it's easier to not tunnel.
[2:42:47] <+angelnickl> Killer has the power to grace the poor survivors a hatch.
[2:42:51] <%king_wragles> "You must understand what the developers had in mind with the hatch. Know it's parts, the timer and triggers"
[2:42:54] <%TheWinged7> you need to turn off Elmo first?
[2:42:58] <%BoxNavy> D:
[2:43:09] <@PlagueOfGripes> elmo remains

[2:43:22] <Candy_Kaiju> Elmo stays winning
[2:43:23] <joso_grando> elmo is eternal
[2:43:30] <@SoFarFetched> I remember a newbie killer was gonna give me hatch,but the second to last survivor wouldn't let go of hook. Killer got imapatient and just hooked me,which I was like "y'know...thats fair" LUL
[2:43:33] <PleaseCallMeSugar> psh, right paige, you can't fool us
[2:43:34] <Sotetsu> Woo, Outriders!

[2:48:58] <+Kinoskae> easier to stun now
[2:49:10] <+kewlmyc> THE MUSIC
[2:49:11] <MackFighters> Mikey is level 3 now!
[2:49:13] <%ttc_lover> If it‚Äôs still within the return period, might be worth considering returning the Sony camera, they are notoriously bad for overheating so unfortunately not super great for streaming webcam use. Canon and Fujifilm cameras for the most part don‚Äôt have that difficulty. Maybe checkout the Fuji XE4, really small and has a display that flips over top the camera so you can see from it‚Äôs point of view and touch screen to change sets easier
[2:49:17] <JanusII> I bet they're all like I can't believe Famous Streamer PeachSaliva went AFK at an important moment during the most important online game of anything in our entire lives.
[2:49:29] <Coystick> He cuumin'

[2:58:04] <%LeRouch_the_Rebel> My favorite is the old bitchy one Kappa
[2:58:10] <extradopeness> Yeah it‚Äôs the charm of the show
[2:58:11] <$thomassolorio> rose is the heart
[2:58:21] <extradopeness> Blanche gets it a lot tho
[2:58:25] <a_mad_dragon_> fun fact: golden girls canonically takes place two doors down from empty nest
[2:58:29] <+Kinoskae> My wife and I are watching OZ again...
[2:58:37] <heartlesshealer> Golden Girls is eternal
[2:58:38] <$Sphincter_Spelunker> Inbetweeners is a shit on each comedy
[2:58:39] <blackbeaking> sex in the city has aged so poorly in everything except the fashion lol
[2:58:46] <$Sphincter_Spelunker> each other*
[2:58:50] <+Kinoskae> Yes, it's an amazing show
[2:58:51] <Ell1ot> i used to think the little old lady was the oldest but she was the youngest, i was told
[2:58:58] <ScarabLordVhok> how is the new se up going? i saw part of the last video of you trying to get everything set up
[2:59:03] <$AzureGale> Does Golden Girls also include 3 Doors Down?
[2:59:10] <extradopeness> Isn‚Äôt there like an HIV/AIDS episode on Golden Girls
[2:59:13] <Coystick> The trauma of having to watch Sexy City with my high school sweetheart still haunts me.
[2:59:17] <blackbeaking> will and grace is iconic and needs more love
[2:59:21] <%BoxNavy> really?
[2:59:25] <$Chatterbox1991> @PeachSaliva  you ever see the Robot Chicken Bit on Golden Girls x Sex in the City?
[2:59:26] <+skeletrail> WAIT SOPHIA
[2:59:27] <Ell1ot> and it b lew my mind
[2:59:33] <$thomassolorio> big mamas house and the nanny too
[2:59:40] <$Sphincter_Spelunker> @Coystick Gilmore Girls for me. I win
[2:59:43] <+SenorCounter> I mean Menopause piece.
[2:59:43] <UlriktheSlayer1> sophia is best golden girl
[2:59:46] <+waltzqueen> the nanny was fun
[2:59:53] <+bunchaghosts> they tackled THE ISSUES
[3:00:00] <Ell1ot> i like to imitate her laugh
[3:00:00] <$thomassolorio> the life time morning and after noon line up
[3:00:04] <%LeRouch_the_Rebel> The butler tho
[3:00:07] <extradopeness> Yeah that was a really well done episode
[3:00:09] <Shacklebox> The spinoff had a great episode with Don Cheadle and the confederate flag
[3:00:12] <+Kinoskae> OZ is one of those shows that's obviously dated, but it's still SO GOOD, and the themes are still relevant
[3:00:14] <%sonlascivious> sex and the city wanted to be scandalous to start with then just continued to age like milk
[3:00:14] <ScarabLordVhok> i watched all these shows growing up but i never saw them in order because it was on tv
[3:00:16] <%MisterRockett> I couldn't get into The Nany when I was a kid.
[3:00:17] <HalloweenHangover> Niles is a great character.
[3:00:20] <Coystick> Fran Drescher is still hot
[3:00:24] <PartyFavors> The Nanny is one of my all time favorites. I have so many memories of watching it on Nick at Nite.
[3:00:26] <UlriktheSlayer1> niles is great
[3:00:36] <+lynlyn_ow> I miss 3's company
[3:00:40] <$thomassolorio> i miss the sitcom butler
[3:00:41] <blackbeaking> frasier is so good, I watched it all in like 3 months and it was amazing
[3:00:45] <%YakumoYomi> Speaking of older sitcoms, I used to watch Designing Women with my mom
[3:00:47] <heartlesshealer> I wish The Nanny were still on tv now that I'm an adult. I remember it coming on half the time I was at my aunt's after school
[3:00:47] <maverickdrifter> Yo we talkin frasier?
[3:00:47] <%Carquar> I remember my mom telling me that the reason Fran Drescher's voice was the way it was is because she accidentally inhaled a bunch of mustard
[3:00:53] <$thomassolorio> hell ya she is
[3:01:02] <BackflipCharm> I was always more of a Fresh Prince person myself
[3:01:05] <$Chatterbox1991> Married with Children was metal as fuck
[3:01:06] <Xelhesia> theres not many shows like the nanny anymore :(
[3:01:06] <BigManLugan> hard to believe Frasier is coming back
[3:01:18] <%CopperTucker> News Radio aged fairly well.
[3:01:26] <spicystarbursts> Frasier is a classic. I don't recall the material being dated
[3:01:27] <$thomassolorio> i want a nanny reboot call it bubby about her watching her grand children
[3:01:36] <%sonlascivious> i think some people are too quick to jump to holding those shows to todays standards
[3:01:42] <$Chatterbox1991> @PeachSaliva  theres a bunch of legit good sitcomes that good killed by the writers strike
[3:01:45] <+Kinoskae> Six Feet Under was another really good HBO show from the 90's
[3:01:46] <extradopeness> Some of the later Frazier episodes are kinda rough
[3:01:46] <$thomassolorio> and being a total gilf
[3:01:48] <$Chatterbox1991> Girlfriends
[3:01:52] <%PrincessAlex23> Sex ans the City aged fine, it's just ALWAYS been like that.
[3:01:57] <$AzureGale> Wowowowowwowowoowow
[3:01:58] <heartlesshealer> Yeah, it's a shame, but the strike had to happen
[3:01:59] <Xelhesia> wow
[3:02:00] <BerryliciousDefinition> oooooo
[3:02:01] <$Sphincter_Spelunker> Bloodborne hunter?? wtf
[3:02:02] <dots4eyes> Gunman
[3:02:08] <spicystarbursts> is this a new map? I dtopped when the twins killer came out
[3:02:09] <@SoFarFetched> oh Deathslinger
[3:02:14] <samwantsham> love some good ole peach saliva
[3:02:15] <@SoFarFetched> @spicystarbursts they reworked the old maps.
[3:02:19] <CandyCoatedConfection> can't stand death slinger. don't know why though.
[3:02:27] <UlriktheSlayer1> cool
[3:02:28] <Coystick> GUN Slinger
[3:02:29] <+ChaseArcade> That 70‚Äôs Show is still really great.
[3:02:30] <ExileNineteen> i didn't used to think slinger was that bad
[3:02:34] <@SoFarFetched> They've been updating the graphics on everything slowly,so many maps have gotten the update.
[3:02:41] <ExileNineteen> until you play some r1 ones that hit every shot
[3:02:42] <$renegade_blade> madgleYeehaw
[3:02:45] <PleaseCallMeSugar> That 70's Show, ironically, is timeless
[3:02:55] <+TopTieramisu> as long as you don't think about the actors
[3:02:57] <$Sphincter_Spelunker> @chasearcade not when you know about Danny Masterson in hindsight
[3:03:00] <$AzureGale> I thought Pat played Pyramid Head almost exclusively
[3:03:06] <spicystarbursts> huh maybe i will get back into dbd, to see the graphics if anything
[3:03:07] <UlriktheSlayer1> my friends and i watch a lot of that 70s show growing up
[3:03:15] <+ChaseArcade> It is. Shame That 80‚Äôs Show was so awful.
[3:03:18] <@SoFarFetched> this is gonna make me play some DbD later.
[3:03:21] <+angelnickl> You got this!
[3:03:26] <%Wiiplayah43> @Sphincter_Spelunker What? He looks like a cowboy, though.
[3:03:30] <$TIME_PUNCHER> hands? is there a goblin near?
[3:03:32] <$thomassolorio> noice
[3:03:37] <Ell1ot> all this talk of bbq and chili is making me hungry
[3:03:41] <ExileNineteen> surv queues are so long that i can watch stream in big chunks
[3:03:43] <Xelhesia> Friends is still great too
[3:04:07] <@SoFarFetched> time to leave
[3:04:08] <@SoFarFetched> LUL
[3:04:12] <marvel877> Try watching That 70s Show over and over because nothing else's on tv. You realize fast all the times Donna's right for the wrong reasons and Eric's wrong for the right reasons.
[3:04:26] <@SoFarFetched> D: D:
[3:04:29] <Elite_Beat_Gator> He Knows
[3:04:30] <$AzureGale> u ded
[3:04:33] <Coystick> sweatin
[3:04:34] <$thomassolorio> i want Lady Dimitrescu in this game
[3:04:41] <TheA1ternative> ass blast usa
[3:04:46] <@SoFarFetched> Paige you should probably leave cause someone is on hook
[3:04:46] <@SoFarFetched> LUL
[3:04:53] <@SoFarFetched> or was
[3:05:00] <PleaseCallMeSugar> if lady dimitrescu was in this game, too many people would lose on purpose
[3:05:02] <heartlesshealer> ffffff
[3:05:09] <spicystarbursts> I think the only reason we still use TV is cuz my parents still want to watch Bold and Beautiful
[3:05:15] <$Sphincter_Spelunker> LadyDChokingMePogChamp
[3:05:17] <extradopeness> I started watching the waltons recently and I fucking love it
[3:05:18] <+ChaseArcade> I could watch Red get angry and threaten to put his foot in Eric‚Äôs ass forever.
[3:05:18] <Ell1ot> wont Dimitrescu bump her head on all the doors?
[3:05:19] <$thomassolorio> dont be a hero
[3:05:24] <%skyentombment> Oh good, still good time to get some OH LORD GOD JESUS IN HEAVEN
[3:05:31] <PleaseCallMeSugar> @Sphincter_Spelunker god mood
[3:05:33] <Coystick> COWARDS WAY
[3:05:50] <%theshyzombie> theshyzombie subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 6 months!
[3:05:54] <$thomassolorio> discretion is the better part of vallor
[3:06:15] <+ChaseArcade> Red Foreman needs to be a killer in DBD. He kills you then calls you a ‚ÄúDumbass!‚Äù
[3:06:15] <+Kinoskae> Totem to your left
[3:06:18] <$TheNewZealandStory> you couldve saved him
[3:06:22] <%Chichen> "sucks... TO BE YOU"
[3:06:23] <Discount_CJ> I mean you could help me
[3:06:24] <$thomassolorio> hes fine
[3:06:32] <ExileNineteen> deathslinger has big red forman energy
[3:06:33] <TheA1ternative> he's fiiiiiiiiine
[3:06:42] <@SoFarFetched> they D'C'd LUL
[3:06:48] <CandyCoatedConfection> I would dc too in this situation tbh
[3:06:49] <Pablo_Gonzalo> I don't blame them
[3:06:53] <$GenesisKnight> Sorry not sorry?
[3:06:55] <%JoshManVGH> What is the benefit of breaking totems?
[3:07:05] <+Kinoskae> More bloodpoints
[3:07:10] <$TheNewZealandStory> cant blame someone for d/cing when your team just watches you die
[3:07:14] <+Kinoskae> and it helps with certain hexes
[3:07:14] <$Sphincter_Spelunker> get to fingering that machinery, Dwight
[3:07:17] <%maskofmichael> stops hexs
[3:07:18] <ExileNineteen> there are many killer buffs that utilize totems. when you break certain totems, you can dispel the buffs
[3:07:20] <spicystarbursts> bloodpoints or to stop specific killer abilities
[3:07:26] <$thomassolorio> good what ever ajective makes u happy
[3:07:33] <+Kinoskae> Crunchy, crunchy totems
[3:07:35] <%JoshManVGH> Neat!
[3:07:37] <@SoFarFetched> @JoshManVGH stops hexes that do certain things,depending on lit/unlit totems.
[3:07:48] <ExileNineteen> these days it seems like 1/2 of killers use noed so doing bones is always worth
[3:07:48] <$AzureGale> R U D E
[3:07:51] <@SoFarFetched> Yeah the person on hook disconnected. I would have just taken teh  bloodpoints.
[3:07:54] <itIsJustMat> they died on hook then dc'd
[3:08:02] <$TheNewZealandStory> well they were already dead when they disconnected
[3:08:04] <@SoFarFetched> cause bloodpoints is bloodpoints
[3:08:05] <+Kinoskae> Oh he sees you for sure
[3:08:05] <@SoFarFetched> LUL
[3:08:07] <spicystarbursts> i see Disconnecting like jerk is still a part of this game
