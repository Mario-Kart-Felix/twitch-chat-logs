[0:12:00] <blueboy7529> i dont think pat hits paige i think its the other way around
[0:12:01] <%rzb0828> apatPat apatFist
[0:12:02] <%MaximumDaximum> HEAVY SPLOOSH
[0:12:02] <%Freelance7> If he had hit you, you would break into pieces
[0:12:04] <%jcloud648> sipsipRude
[0:12:04] <dreu81> M. O. I. S. T.
[0:12:04] <+Ches_Neckbeard> we all know Paige is the abusive one in this relationship
[0:12:04] <Milo_san> !hooker
[0:12:05] <Zeemod155> Paige probably hits Pat Kappa
[0:12:06] <zaptar13> OMG HE DID LUL
[0:12:07] <$ImasukyLomae> Paige would bruise like a tomato
[0:12:08] <reonome> LUL
[0:12:09] <Psych_man13_13> @PeachSaliva So Pat, how many times through Heavy Rain will this make it for you?
[0:12:09] <+jerree66> !hooker
[0:12:09] <$dotta5> with your dong
[0:12:11] <ShadeTheNovice> LUL
[0:12:11] <deviljhojho94> you are a mod, can you not ban automod? Kappa
[0:12:13] <+bri8203> not the zip! zip down! without zip!
[0:12:16] <Fujiwara_92> LUL
[0:12:16] <%GeneSlamm> Sounds like a woolie explanation
[0:12:17] <puddingpants88> shes like the least trashy lady on the net, hard swears was just weird
[0:12:17] <%ziriken> Do you know the origin of make out?
[0:12:17] <%Freelance7> It's damaging her brain so much, that she falls in love with you
[0:12:19] <$iwasJase> crazy talk
[0:12:20] <%Solidnick18> okay
[0:12:20] <blueboy7529> consensual whoring
[0:12:21] <%TheOnlyStrayCat> @MelBrooksKA I hate Automod too.
[0:12:22] <UselessTheDog> Why
[0:12:24] <orihsnek> you smash her with your charm club
[0:12:25] <ape_hawk> "short"
[0:12:26] <+cvp5127> one hour later
[0:12:27] <Primary_> I'm wondering what pat was doing on the pc for 2 hours in the DS stream when they were just talking
[0:12:28] <+Chimeraelite> it's their "play" for naughty times
[0:12:29] <UselessTheDog> The sadness never ends
[0:12:30] <Mr_LupLup> Ik ben vulgaris, magistralis, en ik bewerk die vrouwtjes met mien knots
[0:12:30] <ape_hawk> 4 HOURS LATER
[0:12:30] <$FrustratedAF> th bad game
[0:12:32] <LoudBass1821> Now we know how pat got Paige
[0:12:32] <ShadeTheNovice> Of a heavy variety
[0:12:32] <ToneBacas> the caging
[0:12:32] <%Solidnick18> the cage fall
[0:12:33] <$GohanEgret> splash mountain
[0:12:36] <lozovalazo1> I did not hit her!!!
[0:12:38] <%bribees> let the rain fall down
[0:12:39] <RichAnvils> consensual whoring is called marriage
[0:12:45] <JZPotter> Heavy Whore
[0:12:45] <jerobees> WOW

[0:13:02] <GarbageQueenEllie> I really wanted Detroit to be ze bad game. Have I been bamboozled?
[0:13:03] <whimsicallifestyle> PangriestAt
[0:13:04] <$GohanEgret> beech you app
[0:13:05] <+JoeStillLife> Can't wait to see Pat lose
[0:13:05] <%jcloud648> Whores make more women for Paige to murder
[0:13:05] <Worldbrand> pat already got beat up and now he's stroking out
[0:13:06] <DracaenaLeaf> Did I miss more A Way Out?
[0:13:06] <@MelBrooksKA> @PeachSaliva Please turn off automod, it's really annoying to have to say "pussy" is fine for the 8th time
[0:13:07] <ShadeTheNovice> Should we though?
[0:13:09] <elchupacabra1987> le mauvais jeu
[0:13:09] <@Moobot> Do you have a Fanfiction for Paige to read? Submit it to us here and it may get read on stream! http://bit.ly/2jsxJo9
[0:13:10] <Decsevm> is pats brain melting?
[0:13:10] <+LogothX> Fightcade or 30th?
[0:13:14] <%Solidnick18> pat is gonna blow up that guy in 3rd strike
[0:13:15] <Fujiwara_92> fuck him up
[0:13:16] <+AngriestAngryArtist> NICE! I'll try to catch it :D
[0:13:17] <@WoolyFish> You can watch Pat lose at 2PM EST tomorrow here. https://www.twitch.tv/angriestpat
[0:13:20] <ZeoNidia> does the stream look a bit fuzzy today or is it my eyeballs/computer
[0:13:21] <Cjthebagman> How appropriate. The ad I'm getting is Detroit.
[0:13:22] <Mr_LupLup> Paige your tit is out, please fix that
[0:13:22] <SGrim> PatSaliva and AngriestPeach LuL
[0:13:23] <Primary_> I feel like he has evolved from angriestpat to loudestpat
[0:13:23] <Phantonbat> So Pat's getting double perfected by Eyepatch Wolf then?
[0:13:26] <PopdropGardner> So I'm surprised Pat can kill a single character more than once tbh
[0:13:26] <+jerree66> @WoolyFish shots fired
[0:13:28] <Decsevm> when is fighterpedia coming back?
[0:13:28] <roada_rolla_da> Pat is gonna be so blown up
[0:13:29] <Sleepofgiants> angriestpeach and patsaliva
[0:13:30] <Zantetzuken> pat's verbal influence is spreading
[0:13:31] <zaptar13> Don't get drunk or you might suck eyepatchwolf's sick
[0:13:32] <$FrustratedAF> pat's got all the twelve tech he's been hiding Kappa
[0:13:32] <lozovalazo1> Pat beats Wolves live on stream
[0:13:35] <+TeethMuncher> What if eye patch picks Chun li?
[0:13:38] <+ArcadeTrick> Lol they both suck Jebaited
[0:13:40] <mrjohncarlton> Will this 3rd Strike stream end with somebody getting their dick sucked? Kappa

[0:34:50] <Worldbrand> My favourite is "I will hit you and I won't stop until the police come"
[0:34:53] <AbnormalEnd> a single gaze at pat's small man complex can see that he is no threat at all
[0:34:55] <The_Butterfly_Man> as paige looks down at pat and says she is ok
[0:34:57] <+G_Thunders> @castellanvon I was actually shocked at how badly that ending went compared to what I got playing the game
[0:34:58] <%LifesNeverHumDrum> but then she'd somehow take damage after

[1:27:46] <KommandantRaphael > Ethan has clearly crushed jason for being a stupid shit
[1:27:47] <Cjthebagman> That car was a hamon user.
[1:27:47] <TheFilth> Cage demanded Jason's life
[1:27:47] <SwindlerOfProgress> I've never heard that explanation.
[1:27:48] <turf_wind_and_fire> It's like Black Panther's suit

[1:28:21] <Psyramics> how did he get on the other side of the street the first time?
[1:28:21] <HayabusaTaichou> It looks like Ethan slams Jason's head into the ground and that's what kills him.
[1:28:21] <Sotetsu> This game is full of anti-car propoganda.

[1:29:09] <$jorgamund> he got a balloon and then booked it OUT OF THE MALL
[1:29:10] <+Jaysky> Mikatonic apparently Jason thought his parents went there? Which makes zero sense.
[1:29:11] <+MechaBaphomet> the whole family is
[1:29:13] <Everpresent_Overseer> Maybe he is slow
[1:29:15] <$wolfofsound> jason screeching
[1:29:16] <+G_Thunders> He was supposed to be like 6 originally I think
[1:29:16] <+Fenrirlives> Ethan should've pulled a Rosa Ushiromiya on that child
[1:29:16] <Liwyn> jason is on the cage spectrum
[1:29:17] <+cereal_box_conspiracy> Why does Jason make a beeline into traffic?
[1:29:17] <sponsoredviewer910> game over, you got the good ending

[1:29:17] <3InchMensch> Yes, different than all the other living children
[1:29:18] <TheFilth> I'm sorry Ethan, your son has been diagnosed with plot convenience

[1:29:30] <+HaleScythe> The word is "challeneged" these days.
[1:29:30] <%punkthepsychopenguin> @Jaysky I think originally, the killer lured Jason away for kidnapping and they scrapped that.
[1:29:31] <missingangle> Then Cage made a retarded boy get himself killed. So really, let's not go there lol
[1:29:32] <periwnklepaladin> I never realised how shitty of a scene that was.
[1:29:32] <JusTTheGuyYouNeed> The question here is why the little shit crossed the street
[1:29:33] <+NightOwlSam> he was supposed to be younger, which would fit better

[1:31:13] <bambowl> because he didn't JASON enough
[1:31:14] <%punkthepsychopenguin> So here's an important question: Why is the woman who "hit" Jason not a playable character?
[1:31:17] <$Dutchpotato> They got a divorce because of it
[1:31:18] <+TRYH4RDBL4CKGUY> the kid had like autism or something
[1:31:19] <ArgentUndaCova> Natural selection at work, I guess.
[1:31:19] <Mythundare> Kid would totally be in the front seat here
[1:31:19] <+Jimboq> ethan mars- dad of the year 2010
[1:31:19] <faegbeard> This isn't a tragedy, it's a miracle of natural selection.
[1:31:22] <+MarshallLee67> was Jason an android from CyberLife who was literally built to die?
[1:31:23] <%StubYourToe> death by plot
[1:31:24] <SwindlerOfProgress> Nah, Paige, you're making too much sense. It's Ethan's fault because the plot says so.
[1:31:25] <zeus200045> Wouldn't Ethan still be charged with negligence?
[1:31:25] <$SvenHolgersson> Why didn't they just have him fall into the road or something jesus

I'm three stops away from my home and a goddamn tree branch falls on the track out of nowhere. I somehow got out of the train hopped on a lyft. I was super hungry and in need for a gyro but the gyro cart was no where to be found. Hangry and tired I went home defeated only to find leftovers and my favorite streamers online! NY struggles are real.

[2:39:10] <$QueequegTheater> Don't forget that Lucatiel is also BIG and STRONG as fuck. Lupus truly is a buff
[2:39:15] <%zenwebley> It's like the opposite of plot armor
[2:39:28] <blackbaron98> jormangand is very good, whatch that shit

[2:39:43] <+Nomicro4u> Jason was made of paper... Origami paper.

[2:39:44] <+Blargimazombie> The jason
[2:39:45] <@MelBrooksKA> The scene was poorly done if we have to work to rationalize it
[2:39:45] <cj_art> kill them all, ethan
[2:39:47] <+TeethMuncher> Spiderman comics, the epitome of physics
[2:39:47] <Naho_Saenoki> @zenwebley It's like if the plot armor had iron maiden spikes in it.
[2:39:55] <$low_ver_zealous> Elmo is looking extra brick-like today, what a sweet boy
[2:39:56] <+Ches_Neckbeard> Jason had a weak bitch neck like a punk ass
[2:39:57] <Phantonbat> Jason cracks his head on the ground
[2:40:00] <Everpresent_Overseer> @zenwebley Plot Target Mark?
[2:40:01] <+AntithesisEK> jason being Cage's gwen stacy is profound
[2:40:01] <%MightyMaxT> Jason got Gwen Stacy'd
[2:40:02] <%KendallLitDinner> why even have Ethan dive for him? it just adds confusion
[2:40:04] <HayabusaTaichou> Jason definitely dies from Ethan shoving his head into the ground.

[2:40:31] <Ser_Randal> Just like my japanese animes
[2:40:32] <ShadeTheNovice> ?
[2:40:32] <blackmagemasher> your idea would ruin the plot
[2:40:32] <TheFilth> it would've been hilarious
[2:40:33] <+the_cyclone_wolf> Jason was killed by Ethan's EX Chariot Tackle
[2:40:34] <Prism_Wing> Ethan gave Jason an RKO
[2:40:34] <blackmagemasher> just sayin'
[2:40:36] <%Freelance7> This totally wasnt funny
[2:40:37] <Everpresent_Overseer> He used Jason as a cushion against the asphalt
[2:40:37] <+Blargimazombie> Final Destination
[2:40:37] <%zenwebley> Since I'm guessing David Cage infact uses darts to decide his plot's direction

[2:40:44] <+serpenttucker> @PeachSaliva It's also possible that Jason just had his neck snapped from an awkward landing after getting clotheslined by his father and then hit by a car.

[3:28:14] <grayjammer> an origami in the hand is worth two orchids in the bush
[3:28:20] <+yet_another_brony> its probably facing the same both ways
[3:28:20] <Valkyrjsen> Look at those quantic dreams people
[3:28:21] <Hawkbone_> @thesw1tch How does the drugs help his detecting?

[3:28:24] <%Mr_y1096> cahm
[3:28:29] <justdukefreeman> it's pat
[3:28:29] <%breakfastmegapowers> Why is the text on the virtual documents facing the Camera and not Jayden?
[3:28:29] <+Derpprime> auuhwganized
[3:28:33] <+clifin> the bureau is very inclusive
[3:28:34] <qaaj> Awganized
[3:28:38] <Valkyrjsen> It IS Pat.
[3:28:39] <+thesw1tch> he's on drugs right now, doing detective work
[3:28:40] <redeq2> Where‚Äôs the sounds coming from cmonBruh
[3:28:45] <%Mr_y1096> apatWhat it wasn't me guys
[3:28:46] <%LifesNeverHumDrum> the real origami killer is not a day under 50
[3:28:50] <+yet_another_brony> vr
[3:28:52] <$dotta5> "He probably wears hooker boots and claims them as being rustic"
[3:28:53] <Hawkbone_> @thesw1tch No he's not
[3:28:56] <Minorou> not a single lead, but they have a profile
[3:28:57] <benjiFG> if he only wears one glove how is he using his ungloved hand
[3:28:58] <+bloomingzonda> pat is the killer
[3:28:59] <+thesw1tch> yeah he is
[3:29:18] <Hawkbone_> @thesw1tch He never took the drugs. This is the ARI glasses
[3:29:23] <mercado94> @redeq2 the sunglasses has speakers bursting sound effect for the experience
[3:29:29] <+thesw1tch> @hawkbone_ I'm not spoiling the game. he's on drugs
[3:29:37] <SubliminaIMessages> Spoiler alert Elmo did it
[3:29:37] <@Moobot> We're accepting fanfiction submissions, if you think you have a good one message a mod today!
[3:29:38] <+Gravity_Gunner> No Data? Data would have solved this already
[3:29:40] <Aussie_Manny> Nahman Jayden.
[3:29:44] <topendbuzz> why tho?
[3:29:44] <redeq2> The killer is smaller than a chocolate rabbit
[3:29:47] <%GarbageNirvana> The interface for this is needlessly fancy
[3:29:56] <%Freelance7> No daytuh
[3:29:58] <Hawkbone_> @thesw1tch I never said you were spoiling it, and no, hes not on drugs. This is the glasses.
[3:30:02] <%LifesNeverHumDrum> Chevra Lee
[3:30:03] <MetaFurrical> there's no such thing as needlessly fancy
[3:30:08] <+Nefarious_Bear> vineRaptor
[3:30:11] <%GeneSlamm> Man fuck malibus
[3:30:16] <latgeek> Literally nothing about tire tracks could tell you an exact model and year.
[3:30:17] <%GarbageNirvana> There is when it gets in the way of efficiency
[3:30:23] <Aussie_Manny> Do Datah 4 G-O Anal Isis.
[3:30:26] <+thesw1tch> @hawkbone_ did you ever beat this game?
[3:30:32] <+TeethMuncher> How is there still crime if this future tech is available?
[3:30:33] <Hawkbone_> @thesw1tch Yes.
[3:30:37] <%zenwebley> I was about to make a Jarvis joke before I remembered that Lloyd the Ghostly Bartender is in this game....
[3:30:39] <awooliehunterisneveralone> That's not how future police work!
[3:30:45] <%GarbageNirvana> And when you're solving a goddamn series of serial murders you probably wanna keep things neat and tidy
[3:30:49] <%LifesNeverHumDrum> kaaaahmen
[3:30:57] <latgeek> I buy my origami at the origami stoah!
[3:30:58] <vonmaultke> Why is he making such detailed guesses over such little evidence Jebaited
[3:31:00] <$dotta5> just like pornography
[3:31:02] <%Metballs> That's a lot of flower shops
[3:31:04] <awooliehunterisneveralone> AWKID
[3:31:05] <%Freelance7> NO DAYTUH
[3:31:07] <%MightyMaxT> Kahmen Sandiega?
[3:31:12] <%Metballs> Liek 3 a street
[3:31:13] <VritraReiRei> Why does the killer have to buy his paper specifically from an origami store? what's wrong with regular paper
[3:31:15] <mr_slaide> Elmo is such a good boy.
[3:31:16] <+TeethMuncher> @vonmaultke because he's a protagonist
[3:31:16] <qaaj> The awkid is a kamen sphecies.
[3:31:17] <MetaFurrical> I dunno, people design things to look nice to keep people relaxed and motivated to work hard
[3:31:21] <redeq2> Where‚Äôs the loli file ?
[3:31:22] <Press_X_ToJASON> remember when matt and pat watched jayden say there was one origami store, and decide there were 100?
[3:31:22] <Firesparks> which character have the most common death? madison or jaden?
[3:31:23] <mr_slaide> Look at that beautiful child.

[3:31:54] <+thesw1tch> @hawkbone_ then remember what happened? he's doing drugs as we speak
[3:32:02] <eduwardovich> P?
[3:32:02] <%LifesNeverHumDrum> @vritrareirei right? a smart man would just cut printer paper to size or something
[3:32:09] <msshakedown> Orchid pollen is a sticky liquid, not dust. Doesn't make sense that it would be leaving such a powerful scent trail, especially in the rain.
[3:32:10] <+thesw1tch> I would love virtual drugs myself
[3:32:17] <+cerberuscarmine> aaaaaaaand
[3:32:17] <Hawkbone_> @thesw1tch You fucking idiot this is virtual reality not drugs.

[3:39:30] <+irregularcog> @Hawkbone_ I have my own ideas on the logic of the "VR glasses are real drug" thing. I figure the idea is that the spacial reality that Jayden sees is so real that using it so much messes with him. Also there's probably a neural link of some sort and it's an early prototype
[3:39:34] <%LifesNeverHumDrum> thank God he had pants on

[4:29:13] <%Djinnazz> why didn't she take her inhaler?
[4:29:17] <%LifesNeverHumDrum> my childhood asthma also went away. but i have also always had bad lung capacity as well
[4:29:18] <mushrooming> Childhood asthma can resolve itself
[4:29:19] <MetaFurrical> D"
[4:29:20] <$RubberFistFight> Pat-dot-exe has stopped working
[4:29:20] <+clifin> it was a steroid, it sometimes go away as you age

[4:29:25] <+DarkOnyx7> elaT
[4:29:26] <Lunatyr_> He's remembering PogChamp
[4:29:32] <Rowan_Atkinsonn> I used the same thing and got rid of mine
[4:29:32] <Willfordbrimly> Teddy Roosevelt had asthma as a child but grew out of it
[4:29:33] <+cvp5127> is that why you cant smell
[4:29:35] <$RubberFistFight> @PeachSaliva - it's a weird sweet metallic taste
[4:29:36] <HappiestFace> i have that now its bad, i canno breathe
[4:29:36] <+PenmanLupine> Revelaiton
[4:29:40] <zhen_Twitch> Does it taste like asparagus?
[4:29:47] <Liwyn> thats why he cant smell
[4:29:53] <%LifesNeverHumDrum> oh no
[4:29:54] <MissMalisin> Redbull is gross
[4:29:56] <Willfordbrimly> also ventilin gets you high in a pinch lol
[4:29:57] <zhen_Twitch> Wait did he say pringles?
[4:29:57] <DedlokPM> oh no
[4:29:58] <+irregularcog> I know a badass MMA Jiu jitsu guy who had asthma and stuff but eventually just grew out of it, I guess his lungs grew up
[4:30:00] <@Moobot> We're accepting fanfiction submissions, if you think you have a good one message a mod today!
[4:30:02] <+cerberuscarmine> ooooooooh
[4:30:02] <%SuichiTanaka> Pat is realizing why his tastes are jacked
[4:30:02] <%ssjklyco> i use Albuterol, dont know what ventalin is.
[4:30:05] <ELuscious> But redbulls ruin your kidneys DansGame
[4:30:06] <+LordGeneric> Redbull = Life
[4:30:08] <leinadtonu> So it's a sex thing eh?
[4:30:08] <ItsMeUncleEric> All sorts of revelations today
[4:30:09] <+cerberuscarmine> XD
[4:30:09] <zhen_Twitch> oh it was redbull. I'm deaf.
[4:30:11] <@CreepyPorpoise> Unfortunately the redbull is killing you
[4:30:12] <mercado94> Pat finally connected the dots
[4:30:16] <+ccwettr123> Pat legit addicted to redbull confirmed
[4:30:17] <$Agami23> my brother had a really bad asthma attack in school, and a kid pointed it out to the teacher(who was a sub) and the teacher said and i quote. "oh well, if he dies the janitor can just clean him up" and tried to give the kid and my brother detention for leaving the class after he said that.
[4:30:18] <$rdark_ksu> yo man my lungs are rad as fuck and I love red bull taste
[4:30:20] <Rowan_Atkinsonn> The darkest timeline
[4:30:23] <+clifin> ventolin is i thing albuterol and ipratropium
[4:30:28] <$mister___doctor> Ironically, although they remind you of not dying, they progressively kill you
[4:30:35] <mushrooming> Ventolin is brand name for albuterol
[4:30:41] <zhen_Twitch> I have a severe coffee addiction when I put the stuff in the coffee maker I get a small dopamine rush
[4:30:42] <vonmaultke> I think childhood asthma is related to the rib cage restricting deeper breathing @peachsaliva
[4:30:52] <Phantonbat> Asthma never fully goes away it can e triggered at any time
[4:31:19] <AbnormalEnd> it can go away
[4:31:24] <$mister___doctor> You will always be cursed with Ashma
[4:31:27] <CatmanIX> @Phantonbat it could, but it also might not
