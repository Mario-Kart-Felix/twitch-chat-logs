[0:06:56] <dakotachipmath> @stovetopism she beat dragonslayer first try after being stuck on Heides Tower of Fland for 2 hours.
[0:06:56] <%lewdskeletor13> apatGib
[0:06:56] <VestigeOuroboros> it was glorious
[0:07:00] <%legendfather_of_giants> @stovetopism 2 hours of dying to the giant knights and then oneshotting Dragonrider
[0:07:04] <%altwaal05> altwaal05 subscribed with Twitch Prime. 
[0:07:05] <%BaronVonMagpie> now i gotta wait with baited breath to see weather its a ps4 controller in her hands or I wasted all afternoon
[0:07:07] <%stovetopism> well bad cuz no progress but good that I didnt miss much
[0:07:07] <EphemeralBlitz0> Nice @romanticzomedy enjoy
[0:07:08] <%Caidezes> I hope she makes even less progress than last time today. Just to see Pat's next breakdown.
[0:07:09] <+PaladinDupre> Just once I want them to cut away from the intro and its just Elmo on the couch
[0:07:12] <mesamus> moon knight is coming!
[0:07:15] <%Finakala> Dragonrider is pathetic to be fair
[0:07:19] <%QueequegTheater> @BaronVonMagpie She's on PC mate
[0:07:22] <%romanticzomedy> @EphemeralBlitz0 thanks! have fun finishing up your route too
[0:07:26] <%Sphincter_Spelunker> Last time, Paige bumbled through the zone for over 2 hours and one shot the boss
[0:07:30] <dakotachipmath> It was hilarious when Paige oneshot dragons slayer. Pat was so pissed 😂
[0:07:30] <derekwst3> should i eat ramen or a sandwhich?
[0:07:32] <%legendfather_of_giants> @stovetopism the clip on the subreddit explains it all really
[0:07:35] <%Sphincter_Spelunker> How. can. this. be.

[0:07:39] <EphemeralBlitz0> Kreygasm
[0:07:42] <DemonicHoward> cant wait to spend the next 50 streams trying to get to the petrified forest
[0:07:42] <tusk102> Us: omg woolie is so slow at these games Paige: on her fourth stream and not even done with pursuer
[0:07:43] <EuropanLamprey> I never fight Dragonrider, I just trick him off the edge 10 minutes into a character for free early levels
[0:07:43] <%lewdskeletor13> Paige is an Alpha Gamer, she struggles on enemies and then one shots boss’s
[0:07:43] <%romanticzomedy> pat shrieking in disbelief was the highlight of last stream
[0:07:55] <+AngriestAngryArtist> arent the bosses super lenient
[0:08:04] <+Bailey__gaming> @lewdskeletor13 time to pet the baby, time to shake the bag, time to order wcdonalds
[0:08:08] <+Th3SmartAlec> @dakotachipmath It's kinda hilarious how Dragon Rider is inferior to the very enemies you have to go through to get to him
[0:08:11] <%BaronVonMagpie> Queequeg I die
[0:08:13] <%Finakala> Dragonrider is one of the few Soulsbornesekiro bosses I have never died to
[0:08:14] <+patriotrenegade> Bosses are super easy for the most part
[0:08:18] <Roadrunner_Rebel> upload to youtube! unless you have already...
[0:08:20] <%Sphincter_Spelunker> @AngriestAngryArtist Yes, but she was struggling with the regular enemies

[0:40:08] <%jeffishype> just teach her how to kick
[0:40:09] <video_kojima_> SHE'S LEARNDING
[0:40:13] <@MelBrooksKA> Sun is u[
[0:40:15] <+Pookiedaexzile> Whose sun is setting
[0:40:16] <@MelBrooksKA> up*
[0:40:17] <valriot> Brain Refreshed
[0:40:18] <+HelveticaScenario> Reming her of forward and R1 again, Pat
[0:40:21] <+Forente> apatBig Imporvement
[0:40:21] <%NWR_James> So I fell asleep with the last stream on. I had weird dreams but didnt go back to watch. How likely is it whatever the fuck happened caused them?
[0:40:21] <Gruhunchously> We are all the sun
[0:40:21] <+KnightOfHopeX> Controversial opinion: This game ain't that bad.
[0:40:21] <Skatedeandre> Estus
[0:40:22] <fruit_pie_the_magician> Okay, seriously, her reaction time is easily a half a second better than last time
[0:40:23] <%Finakala> Yeah I came back to DS2 after playing both DS3 and Bloodborne and man it felt slow
[0:40:27] <JoltyJ> She's a neural net processor.
[0:40:31] <Skatedeandre> CHUG
[0:40:33] <Shishi1205> @peachsaliva you can also circle them and backstab them to get them easier.
[0:40:36] <derekwst3> he tells her to use lifegem so she uses estus
[0:40:36] <LoliKappa> adderall is gonna save this playthrough
[0:40:46] <+mh9s> someone send her last stream to a museum because that needs to be remembered for generations
[0:40:47] <Louie_Salmon> Don't worry Pat, you don't need to encourage her to swing
[0:40:49] <%legendfather_of_giants> @derekwst3 use gems during the fight
[0:40:49] <valriot> FULL STR, NO INT
[0:40:53] <%romanticzomedy> adderall and early streams
[0:40:54] <haveswordmuststing> anyone remember those forest bros that just hover on the ground and pretend theyre running by rotating their legs
[0:41:00] <+Hoisengineer> PRAISE THE SUN
[0:41:01] <%Sphincter_Spelunker> never say that name again Pat
[0:41:05] <VestigeOuroboros> The ballista exists.
[0:41:05] <Skatedeandre> “Drop ur shield”
[0:41:09] <%evermoore_hex> 0 Int sipsipDab
[0:41:10] <VestigeOuroboros> But is completely ignored
[0:41:11] <%Yaruzu> God this is completely different
[0:41:13] <DracaenaLeaf> skele archers are plebs
[0:41:13] <haveswordmuststing> those guys are cool
[0:41:15] <JoltyJ> BRUTE SMARTS
[0:41:15] <+YumoNikki> Aye aye cap'n!
[0:41:15] <%romanticzomedy> WE DO IT
[0:41:15] <%patriotrenegade> Ballista isnt worth it
[0:41:15] <pisshound87> didnt see the last stream, surprised she didnt beat the pursuer when it attacks in the level
[0:41:16] <%starotter70> Do it
[0:41:16] <RetributionP> darn I missed all the talking. I guess I'll just leave and watch the vod later
[0:41:17] <+CJett92> Are YOU?
[0:41:17] <Shishi1205> on the dlc many enemies are trivialised by backstabbing
[0:41:17] <Gruhunchously> Remember that she remembered Hank's son's name when no one else could.
[0:41:18] <Debabruce> You know what I mean
[0:41:19] <derekwst3> kill it
[0:41:21] <%legendfather_of_giants> YES
[0:41:23] <%Kenzo2000> Remember that Paige has a record of one shifting bosses if its the first thing in the stream
[0:41:27] <LoliKappa> @Sphincter_Spelunker why Kappa
[0:41:29] <%Finakala> The ballista is perfect for murdering/being murdered by summons more than anything
[0:41:30] <+Th3SmartAlec> Paige, don't jinx it
[0:41:31] <+AmaniIsYourBoss> I can't believe Paige did it first try
[0:41:32] <roburab> first try! let's go
[0:41:33] <derekwst3> you are more confident
[0:41:33] <tigerfang86> HAW HAW
[0:41:36] <%SoFarFetched> harumph harumph
[0:41:39] <TimetodiveLTX> hurfhurf
[0:41:39] <TheFramedWarlock> Valriot you forgot her special ability, [Brute Smarts] which allows her to transform STR into INT after a certain amount of time
[0:41:40] <JoltyJ> huehuehue
[0:41:40] <%zorak100229> Do ittttt
[0:41:41] <tacoisgoods> First try
[0:41:43] <weissguard> YEET
[0:41:45] <%Sphincter_Spelunker> ! overthinking !
[0:41:46] <Fujiwara_92> FIRST TRY TIME
[0:41:47] <DemonicHoward> roll towards the shield
[0:41:49] <+floralkami> yeah, this is a different area?
[0:41:49] <tigerfang86> sure
[0:41:51] <%romanticzomedy> yeah just give up, that's how you win
[0:41:51] <%evermoore_hex> game plan sipsipDab
[0:41:52] <%starotter70> Too late
[0:41:54] <+YumoNikki> Uhhhh....
[0:41:54] <RupanSen> so take it serously
[0:41:55] <+CJett92> She's already dead
[0:41:56] <switchadvictumexe> shes gonna get split, right?
[0:41:57] <%Finakala> I have never killed Pursuer with the ballista, but I have killed the host when I was helping and have been killed by a summon
[0:41:59] <studleydoorite> you've already out thought yourself
[0:42:00] <benjiFG> be bad (good)
[0:42:00] <OwlLightningMage> NO
[0:42:00] <tigerfang86> she's super dead
[0:42:00] <+SamleyTimes> same for me tbh
[0:42:00] <%IminyourBase> so be the silliest
[0:42:00] <%Lion_kun> USE THE BALLISTA
[0:42:01] <Shishi1205> Interesting theory
[0:42:02] <gustavozxd> already wrong
[0:42:02] <LifesNeverHumDrum> why not
[0:42:03] <InugamiTheHound> apatDab
[0:42:03] <+Th3SmartAlec> F
[0:42:03] <worldbrand> i dont think i agree with you

[0:42:03] <Trash_leviathan> nice
[0:42:04] <%MrBorisMakarov> she's dead
[0:42:04] <+Sir_Gawain_Lotsson> F
[0:42:05] <%fattness132> You cannot abuse your powers in that manner paige
[0:42:06] <TwinBat> inb4 it isn't fine
[0:42:06] <OwlLightningMage> REVERSE THAT LOGIC
[0:42:06] <SausageShogun> kick pursuer's ass paige! PogChamp
[0:42:06] <%Kenzo2000> Except when you took it seriously last time
[0:42:07] <+badchoice5> The Pursuer will punish you for your lack of respect
[0:42:07] <weissguard> I'd believe that Paige is capable of beating it First Try of the night right now.
[0:42:07] <Captain_Joe1911> Emlo sleep heart2Eundori zzz

[0:43:22] <Shishi1205> Never used that ring
[0:43:25] <+TheMattman1313> Also Pursurer just negates effigies super hard

[0:43:37] <%Sphincter_Spelunker> DS2 doesn't like that
[0:43:37] <shabop> tracking overheads
[0:43:38] <%Yaruzu> The hitboxes in this game linger way too long
[0:43:38] <Psych_man13_13> But Pat, I hate the ring of binding
[0:43:42] <+Th3SmartAlec> Paige just ignored him
[0:43:42] <pisshound87> no its got the smallest invincibility window in the series
[0:43:45] <+sdelaby> Paige you pretty much always want to roll forward and to the left when he swings. just get into the habit
[0:43:45] <+OkamiDude15> @leole11 probably not
[0:43:46] <Shishi1205> omega punish +tracking hard

[0:45:23] <%QueequegTheater> ALWAYS RIGHT
[0:45:23] <veldinmusic> I find that circling right around him works best
[0:45:23] <pisshound87> from a design perspective this boss fight is meant to teach the player to avoid barrels
[0:45:23] <+badchoice5> Pursuing is a way of life, Paige
[0:45:23] <+Valison> @PeachSaliva Do we type 4 if it's the barrels?
[0:45:24] <RagingLeo> get your PopCorn out everyone

[0:45:28] <InugamiTheHound> aren't you suppose to roll to his right to his shield arm??
[0:45:29] <%chicken_danger> hug his shield
[0:45:30] <Debabruce> YOUR RIGHT always
[0:45:30] <fruit_pie_the_magician> Roll INTO the sword
[0:45:31] <%romanticzomedy> nah the way he swings his sword, rolling right goes through it
[0:45:32] <Skatedeandre> Here we go
[0:45:32] <razdoop> Roll into sword
[0:45:32] <TripleTRex> purser is big

[0:45:34] <Trash_leviathan> you rolled into the sword
[0:45:34] <$Nope80808> You were rolling into the sword
[0:45:34] <+gralho> just hug his shield
[0:45:35] <%Yaruzu> You need to roll into the attacks
[0:45:36] <%lewdskeletor13> Fucking barrels
[0:45:36] <+OctaivianRex> You avoid the backswing if you roll on the right
[0:45:37] <%MediocreHermits> roll threw the sword
[0:45:37] <JoltyJ> This is my first livestream from Paige, glad to see the standard of quality is uphelf.
[0:45:37] <Dingo_Eejit> adoptability?
[0:45:39] <%cureneckbeard> sipsipSipsipblind
[0:45:40] <j3xtrom> @Mendin She doesn't need ADP. She just needs to roll better lol
[0:45:42] <leole11> roll to the other side
[0:45:45] <energywarning> schedule your rolls for next week
[0:45:45] <+Mleahy24> youve got to be agressive against pursuer. push toward him at all times
[0:45:45] <+VashyronM> Wrap your body around the shield.
[0:45:46] <VestigeOuroboros> Does [CRAZY TALK] also invert left and right for the people pat talks to?
[0:45:46] <switchadvictumexe> are shields simply not allowed this run?
[0:45:48] <+HelveticaScenario> Stop using the stones, use Estus
[0:45:48] <Niney_Who> Paige needs to learn to hug the butt
[0:45:49] <Dovakhin573> actually you wanna roll into the sword, become yhe sword
[0:45:50] <+TheMattman1313> @PeachSaliva Not when his swing starts from the ground.
[0:45:53] <+Sir_Gawain_Lotsson> GOBLINS apatGoblin
[0:45:53] <Coystick> Pursuer: ayy bitch you plAY POKER?!
[0:45:54] <%legendfather_of_giants> @PeachSaliva right is WRONG for that attack. Just roll later
[0:45:56] <fruit_pie_the_magician> I think you can probably run this pretty easy
[0:45:58] <AirlineFood74> Paige doesn't know the difference between right and left
[0:45:58] <pisshound87> most enemies you want to roll on the side of them with the weapon but the pursuer is weird
[0:45:58] <%QueequegTheater> @switchadvictumexe It's Paige, so yes
[0:45:59] <%chicken_danger> hhield suggin
[0:45:59] <%patriotrenegade> SWITCH TO ESTUS
[0:46:00] <AxelCezar> my bet is that twins there will dissapear first
[0:46:05] <GarbageQueenEllie> Glomp that booty, Paige
[0:46:06] <RyuuAoi> I'm gonna need some wine for this! 🍷
[0:46:06] <derekwst3> @PeachSaliva Pat go to the bathroom, she nows you are watching and cant play good
[0:46:08] <+badchoice5> Pat, let Paige learn to respect the Pursuer on her own tine
[0:46:09] <%evermoore_hex> coxOrc
[0:46:10] <Louie_Salmon> This arena is actually forshadowing for the lategame mini-boss "Barrel Mimic"
[0:46:12] <hottdogman> damn barrels
[0:46:13] <InugamiTheHound> apatGoblin
[0:46:15] <%Kenzo2000> *rolls early* “My reflexes though”
[0:46:15] <Captain_Aham> slow your roll
[0:46:17] <tacoisgoods> Bob and weave
[0:46:24] <+nekomancerer> Have y'all seen the Moon Knight series has been announced???
[0:46:25] <jonathandemel> @PeachSaliva Imagine Paige with object permanence. She'd be unstoppable
[0:46:26] <+HelveticaScenario> She's using all her life gems, Pat
[0:46:26] <+tuchpi> see what I mean?
[0:46:27] <hottdogman> too much reflexes
[0:46:27] <weissguard> Solid.
[0:46:29] <%chicken_danger> bosses telegraph harder
[0:46:34] <derekwst3> girls are watching
[0:46:37] <razdoop> You actually want to roll into sword
[0:46:37] <%Roasted_Pheasant> is she winning the videogame?
[0:46:38] <JoltyJ> I hope it's crazy Moon Knight
[0:46:40] <Captain_Aham> hardcore gamer reflexes
[0:46:43] <AxelCezar> USE ESTUS PLEEEASE
[0:46:43] <AirlineFood74> @PeachSaliva PLEASE USE THE ESTUS
[0:46:46] <tigerfang86> the PERFECT FIGHTER
[0:46:47] <%legendfather_of_giants> @PeachSaliva hug pursuer's ass and he's EZ with a shield
[0:46:47] <RyuuAoi> @badchoice5 It's Pat... DarkMode
[0:46:49] <%Sphincter_Spelunker> Sunny D
[0:46:52] <Shishi1205> do not r2
[0:46:53] <tigerfang86> she would be the ULTIMATE FIGHTER
[0:46:55] <RagingLeo> so none of these guys are here in the OG version
[0:46:56] <%kelevra___> kelevra___ subscribed with Twitch Prime. 
[0:46:57] <+kenpachi9211> how many deaths tonight?
[0:46:57] <+Pookiedaexzile> I remember that object
[0:46:59] <+OkamiDude15> she would be stronger than dio over heaven
[0:47:00] <+Th3SmartAlec> Paige, ETSUS IS FREE
[0:47:08] <JoltyJ> She traded in Object Permanance for more STR.
[0:47:08] <+Mumbles519> ESTUS
[0:47:08] <alrobot2014> paige would become the ultimate bioweapon
[0:47:09] <pisshound87> its slower than ds1 and obviously bloodborn but this game super rewards aggressive play
[0:47:11] <mostundesired> Oh shit what up, what I miss?
[0:47:11] <%QueequegTheater> SWITCH TO ESTUS
[0:47:13] <DemonicHoward> @PeachSaliva you should also stop fighting people in tight hallways because your hitting your sword on both walls
[0:47:14] <+Pookiedaexzile> Aaaand dead

[0:47:15] <razdoop> Preemptive F
[0:47:16] <switchadvictumexe> paige, summon pat to die on the sword before you
[0:47:17] <VestigeOuroboros> 3 deaths
[0:47:17] <PrimeNeverproc> paiges problem is shes used to sundowning so now the sun is in her eyes
[0:47:17] <GarbageQueenEllie> God made Paige without object permanence because otherwise, she'd be too powerful

[0:48:07] <AirlineFood74> ESTUSSSSS
[0:48:08] <%legendfather_of_giants> @PeachSaliva walking right dodges mostly everything he has
[0:48:08] <%Kuro_Koshka> Estus also heals f a s t e r
[0:48:11] <%evermoore_hex> choked sipsipGasm
[0:48:11] <lupus_man> Estusssss
[0:48:11] <+Mleahy24> always forward
[0:48:12] <Ion_Laser> Damn barrels!
[0:48:13] <pisshound87> much better attempt there
[0:48:15] <tacoisgoods> Estus>Lifegem
[0:48:15] <AxelCezar> why pat is not perceiving the healing item????
[0:48:18] <+TheImmortal70> Panic
[0:48:19] <Louie_Salmon> @mashinchaserr That can only land if you parry
[0:48:20] <AirlineFood74> ESTUS IS BIG FREE
[0:48:20] <Djinnazz> Hear and then you SEE
[0:48:21] <energywarning> it's free estus state
[0:48:22] <+Pookiedaexzile> But it slow
[0:48:23] <+KnightOfHopeX> In fact, you could just shimmy to the right all the time and it would make it easier.
[0:48:24] <+Th3SmartAlec> ITS NOT
[0:48:25] <%QueequegTheater> Literally never
[0:48:25] <%patriotrenegade> IT IS NOT
[0:48:26] <DemonicHoward> also when you go to hte right its eaiser to get behind them
[0:48:26] <AirlineFood74> HONK
[0:48:27] <+TheCrispyBoi> wow healing takes so long in this game
[0:48:28] <%CappuccinoGuil> Estus drinking is actually faster
[0:48:28] <InugamiTheHound> use the estus, its way faster dude
[0:48:29] <+SamleyTimes> *smacks lips*
[0:48:29] <Niney_Who> The lifegem gives you a little bit of mobility but it's the same time
[0:48:30] <AirlineFood74> HOOOOONK
[0:48:30] <mostundesired> Nah, life gems are for travel, estus is for bosses. Generally.
[0:48:30] <kindashagg> Or at least never dodge directly away from him. He tags that for free.
[0:48:31] <+CJett92> C O N S U M M A B L E
[0:48:33] <pisshound87> life gem is very fast, but you need to dodge while you regen
[0:48:33] <Louie_Salmon> The difference is less now, because you have leveled ADP
[0:48:34] <Shishi1205> you have to time the estus that's it
[0:48:34] <+MrHaru> Why would you think it would be faster?
[0:48:34] <%mashinchaserr> sipsipHonk
[0:48:35] <OwlLightningMage> You keep telling her to use them in fights
[0:48:35] <Blazeofflame> Get Smoke'd
[0:48:36] <%Sphincter_Spelunker> watch her click back onto the gems by mistake
[0:48:36] <%Latija> the animation is faster but it heals slower
[0:48:37] <SteveFox90> YOU DIED
[0:48:39] <%jobbedbone> adp makes you drink faster too right?
[0:48:40] <Shishi1205> gems are faster
[0:48:40] <%starotter70> Nice
[0:48:41] <SirKamBam> drop thine shield
[0:48:41] <Coystick> I don't like Roll Souls I hope Elden Ring has no roll.
[0:48:41] <Debabruce> Except the shield extension
[0:48:42] <AxelCezar> bitterShook bitterShook
[0:48:43] <%evermoore_hex> 1
[0:48:45] <dodgy_dingo_> hey fellas

[0:48:48] <JoltyJ> TWOFER
[0:48:48] <%chicken_danger> hug the shield
[0:48:49] <Debabruce> dodge that backwards
[0:48:51] <+Pookiedaexzile> Honk
[0:48:52] <RyuuAoi> Why would you EVER use life gems? Never use items. You never know when you'll need those.
[0:48:53] <+Blargimazombie> They're faster to use, but the healing is slower
[0:48:54] <%Sphincter_Spelunker> then get good
[0:48:54] <%QueequegTheater> Then get better
[0:48:55] <+TopTieramisu> bad mechanic

[0:49:17] <+Mleahy24> baby mode = mace build
[0:49:17] <VestigeOuroboros> Baby mode is now selectable
[0:49:17] <mostundesired> She's still using the bastard sword, right?
[0:49:18] <$HarraceHarrison> Bearer of the curse... would you like a golden Tankui suit?
[0:49:18] <Louie_Salmon> The best kind of easy mode is one that is punishment for losing
[0:49:18] <pisshound87> that only happened with one boss for me and im super embarrassed about it
[0:49:19] <%starotter70> BabyRage
[0:49:19] <%patriotrenegade> You'll wish for baby mode when you have to fight Smelter Demon in Iron Keep @PeachSaliva

[0:56:59] <studleydoorite> I want one CSGO team to take mushrooms and weed for a tourney, and listen to those comms
[0:56:59] <GarbageQueenEllie> eSports is suck a joke

[0:57:07] <InugamiTheHound> does that mean sonic fox take adderall??
[0:57:09] <derekwst3> is shellmo grounded again?
[0:57:13] <mostundesired> ARE YOU SURE?
[0:57:13] <MarylandJutsu> @PeachSaliva Same here, i take it as needed. I feel ya on so many levels
[0:57:13] <fruit_pie_the_magician> Adderall does WAY different things to people who dont have ADD. If you don't have ADD its just literally speed
[0:57:13] <%QueequegTheater> @PeachSaliva I don't have ADHD but a misdiagnosis in high school meant I was on 130 mg of Vyvans a day. Pat, is that a lot?
[0:57:14] <MonstarGrrrl> hiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiigh

[0:57:17] <%Ranryu692> @PeachSaliva I'm amazed you can eat, does it not kill your appetite?
[0:57:19] <+Deano8817> But you're always high
[0:57:20] <JoltyJ> well that's the baseline
[0:57:25] <krymzen5> if you have a real diagnosis, u gen don't feel high
[0:57:25] <+fingalights> Paige high when it wears off
[0:57:25] <snoozeaholic> What if the true eSports were the adderall we took along the way

[0:57:31] <pisshound87> yeah it doesnt make people who have ADD and take a reasonable dose feel high
[0:57:31] <antyriku2> thats because you already are high normally

[0:57:33] <+demon1103> remember winners do drugs. just look at captain america, the biggest drugie

[0:57:52] <Deekman> Can’t you take melatonin to counter the effects? My daughter is adhd and it works for her
[0:57:52] <codycurry52> When I'm high I'm way more focus
[0:57:53] <+MugenSandan> 130 mg of vyvanse is nearly deadly whoever was asking
[0:57:53] <Skatedeandre> Wait where did she put that wrapper
[0:57:54] <SGrim> @PeachSaliva that's because you actually need the medicine. If your brain chemistry works without adderall, then you get high as shit on it.

Also does 3 durability damage per hit and can break invaders armor that has low durabilit (IE third dragon ring). ALSO has s scaling in strength. Also 80% damage reduction so you can use it as a decent shield.

[2:10:31] <$RubberFistFight> @dakotachipmath because she knows it drives you, specifically, insane, and she wakes up every morning wanting nothing more than to piss you off. Alternatively, it's a normal human habit that normal humans have.
[2:10:34] <anar_bael> brute smarts and brute luck
[2:10:38] <$Bt_Robot> They really pumped the drop rate for their gear
[2:10:38] <Torivore> With Gavlan, you real. You feel?

[2:10:48] <RetributionP> no gavlan

[2:29:04] <%king_wragles> Plague, I'm afraid your efforts may be in vain.
[2:29:04] <SGrim> @PlagueOfGripes that would require depth perception, which she doesn't have.
[2:29:04] <%QueequegTheater> WHY
[2:29:05] <+Th3SmartAlec> Many times
[2:29:06] <%chicken_danger> eat an effigy 20% higher max health
[2:29:07] <%QueequegTheater> WHY GO THERE
[2:29:07] <mostundesired> Use hamon
[2:29:09] <@PlagueOfGripes> "Stop and look straight ahead" (turns wildly, whipping camera in every direction) "WHERE"
[2:29:09] <energywarning> girl's on a rampage
[2:29:11] <%JenovasPuppet> Pat is the best coach
[2:29:11] <sheevabestwaifu> Again
[2:29:11] <%Run44forrest> dont go there
[2:29:13] <Dakuu75> "right infront of you" could be the character's orientation or the camera
[2:29:15] <Whiskey_T_Foxtrot> Don't listen to pat. He's trying to steal your glory.
[2:29:18] <+badchoice5> Rushing places she doesn’t need to go

[2:30:06] <Hydrapissed> from focused to frazzled

[2:30:08] <%Run44forrest> Get GREATSWORD BECOME BIG

[2:39:50] <zamzoph> @PeachSaliva stop apologizing
[2:39:51] <+forevermasterless> They invaded you, all bets are off. It's only a "duel" if you consented to it by summoning them in for a fight.

[2:39:54] <%primax104> ah yes, the lannister way
[2:39:54] <+TheMattman1313> Look at DA BABY marking BISCUITS IN THE AIR
[2:39:54] <%Nobrev> HONOR IS A COWARD'S TOOL
[2:39:55] <derap41> If its an invasion you fucking kill them
[2:39:55] <%stovetopism> Only honor if I let you in with a red sign, you invade you have no rights
[2:39:56] <Kingtweedy> NOOOO HONOR
[2:39:56] <%QueequegTheater> @PeachSaliva DUELS get dignity. INVASIONS get no mercy
[2:39:57] <IntrepidEye> and theres the run around like a bitch trying to bait into mobs
[2:39:57] <sonofthedeepsouth> NOOOOO
[2:39:57] <%dmdyne99> PAT IS TYRION CONFIRMED
[2:39:58] <VestigeOuroboros> NO HONOR
[2:39:58] <Jolly_Adventurer> It's more embarrasing if you beat them without healing
[2:39:58] <%velemi> THEY CANT HEAL
[2:39:59] <%Valdorick> Pat = Pragmatic (which is fancy people talk for BIG COWARD)
[2:40:00] <LeftOverPizza13> fair fights don't exist
[2:40:00] <TurtlesAndTentacles> YOU HAVE No HonOR
[2:40:00] <Zarkith> THEY invaded YOU, honor is off the table

[2:40:03] <GarbageQueenEllie> Figures Pat would subscribe to the Tyrion Lannister technique
[2:40:03] <Blurredborderlines> Invaders gst no sympathy
[2:40:03] <Maids4lyfe> @PeachSaliva invaders can't heal in dark souls 2 anyways
[2:40:04] <BakerBrute> Its the Invaders job to pressure you enough that you can't heal
[2:40:04] <+BrotherGaius> You have No honour
[2:40:05] <DemonicHoward> pagie never apologize for killing people
[2:40:05] <leole11> IT WAS AN INVASION, NOT A DUEL
[2:40:05] <andyspz> he gave you items so it was a fight of honour
[2:40:06] <EuropanLamprey> @PeachSaliva paige, invaders can't heal
[2:40:06] <+badchoice5> They let you kill them
[2:40:08] <Ion_Laser> The Tyrion Route is a good route tho
[2:40:09] <Louie_Salmon> Well, they can invade another time, for an honorable duel
[2:40:09] <sheevabestwaifu> Wat guy u wanna be
[2:40:09] <OwlLightningMage> DS PVP DOESN'T MATTER
[2:40:11] <$RubberFistFight> If it's outside of previously-agreed-upon-and-setup rules, like a fightclub, or whatever? Then fuck honor, go for the kill, "fighting clean" is fucking absurd in a game like this.
[2:40:12] <oneterriblemistake> TAKE THE FIRST NAPKIN PAIGE

[2:40:42] <SuspiciousEd> Can somebody actually invade her? She's gonna finish this game not even knowing that invaders are hostile lol
[2:40:45] <%legendfather_of_giants> @PeachSaliva not with estus, they can with miracles IIRC
[2:40:46] <%starotter70> Their wounds cannot heal
[2:40:49] <derap41> invaders are not duelers
[2:40:50] <%QueequegTheater> THEY ARE INVADERS. YOU MURDER THEM AND YOU SMILE WHILE YOU DO IT
[2:40:52] <+badchoice5> Paige is absorbing Pats scumbag tactics
[2:40:55] <anar_bael> TIME FOR GUTS SWORD
[2:41:01] <+Amingingchicken> you're welcome for the armour
[2:41:01] <tigerfang86> Whoa I looked away for a minute and now you have FASHION
[2:41:04] <tigerfang86> BIG FASHION
[2:41:06] <Niney_Who> Now you just need a sick Helmet
[2:41:16] <$nademonkey1100> fasion before stats
[2:41:17] <%JenovasPuppet> Generic Dark Souls enemy: "I"m just going to swing my arms and if you walk into them it's your fault you got hit"
[2:41:17] <%Sphincter_Spelunker> show feet
[2:41:18] <GarbageQueenEllie> Now you just need a pimp hat
[2:41:20] <TMulharin> My mentality is "My house, my rules", unless the invader bows or waves or some other cheerful gesture
[2:41:22] <%dalmek> my fave dishonor is when an allied spirit uses Warmth to heal bosses
[2:41:22] <derap41> But for real don't pick up dropped items the can crash your game
[2:41:26] <%Ranryu692> Ferengi?
[2:41:27] <Niney_Who> buyt HELMET
[2:41:27] <Monkeyweed21> try hat
[2:41:28] <%legendfather_of_giants> @PeachSaliva helmet might work
[2:41:30] <%IShadowStrykerI> guy in the house dropped an item too
[2:41:31] <Blank9> helmet
[2:41:32] <Karhax> People invading should actually try to kill, dropping items is lame
[2:41:34] <NeroInfinite> helmet
[2:41:34] <Louie_Salmon> The helmet is cool though
[2:41:35] <DemonicHoward> wow she got the menu away frsit try
[2:41:35] <%stovetopism> Your current chest piece is also worse than whay out had before
[2:41:37] <%RafflesiaA> Fashion though

[2:42:09] <derekwst3> they dont like torches
[2:42:09] <Dakuu75> the fact that the cape is pure white and shows all the SHIT you walk in though. XD
[2:42:10] <SuspiciousEd> Literally worst advice
[2:42:13] <tigerfang86> BIG

[2:42:17] <%Sphincter_Spelunker> @TMulharin I gave up once and just prostrated once in a DS2 invasion. The guy was actually nice and dropped 25 Hero Soul items. Was a pleasant surprise

[2:55:46] <Shishi1205> yeah she's going to attack backwards
[2:55:48] <Whiskey_T_Foxtrot> One day he'll have enough souls to go to the moon.
[2:55:48] <+NDHCemployee> "I'm learning," she said, lying
[2:55:49] <RyuuAoi> R1 & R2 combos, @peachsaliva !
[2:55:50] <%Kuro_Koshka> R2 sucks
[2:55:50] <sharpington_> R2 must be best because it is STRONG
[2:55:52] <+HelveticaScenario> She needs to be able to one hand this, Pat. The R1 is perfect for crowd control
[2:55:52] <Louie_Salmon> @benjifg It is bigger and slower, and she wants to be the biggest
[2:55:54] <+Forente> if they are staggered you can go for the second swing
[2:55:56] <%Undertakerand619> Hey everyone
[2:55:56] <Shishi1205> I'm predicting it now
[2:56:00] <%chicken_danger> your range is better than most enemies
[2:56:00] <mostundesired> ????
[2:56:01] <oneterriblemistake> the r2 has its uses
[2:56:01] <razdoop> wut
[2:56:02] <%Keyd00d> she was doing better with the other sword
[2:56:02] <%Kuro_Koshka> One handed R1 is the 2H R2 but faster and better
[2:56:03] <+FoolsArcade> she cant do this
[2:56:06] <%audrus> "Im learning" More like im lieing heyo
[2:56:10] <Coystick> Dark Souls 2 is magical!
[2:56:12] <%CommanderSqueaks> Paige says she wants to be the biggest, but she can't handle all the weight and girth of it all.
[2:56:13] <GarbageQueenEllie> r1r1r1
[2:56:14] <DemonicHoward> goodbye sun hello new moon
[2:56:14] <dakotachipmath> LOL
[2:56:17] <snoozeaholic> She cant use it properly until she loses an eye and an arm
[2:56:19] <Blurredborderlines> Should have invested in VIT tbh to wear beefy armor and still roll
[2:56:20] <SPidERMan8576> TehePelo BrokeBack
[2:56:21] <Shishi1205> this thing one handed is pretty cool
[2:56:23] <TheyCallMeVawn> Are you though?
[2:56:24] <%Run44forrest> let go of the left stick
[2:56:26] <OwlLightningMage> Golf swing
[2:56:28] <%chicken_danger> BIG AND STRONG
[2:56:30] <majindusto> Paige really loves saying Ballsacks
[2:56:33] <derap41> Gonna murder the guy in the dress now?
[2:56:33] <Niney_Who> The 1 Handed moveset is better fight me
[2:56:33] <sharpington_> Go left now?
[2:56:37] <CurrySauseBandit> @PeachSaliva You may want to try out doing untargetted attacks as well
[2:56:37] <%Mendin> USE, do not burn, an Effigy Paige
[2:56:38] <razdoop> She is actualy better than woolie right now
[2:56:40] <SulfurousAcid> what sword is this? justgot here
[2:56:40] <Shadope342> da moon go up, but da sun go down
[2:56:40] <sheevabestwaifu> How could this be
[2:56:41] <%Kuro_Koshka> 1 handed is certainly better
[2:56:43] <RyuuAoi> Let him finish his string, then go the FUCK IN
[2:56:43] <%romanticzomedy> YOU LEARNED
[2:56:43] <%audrus> ok
[2:56:44] <%DesuDesuDokiDoki> nice

You, Pat, and many others I watched recently got me hyped up and I want to try again n jump back in as I still believe I have what it takes with my original ideas. Ask you guys how to prep and now that I got the materials, I cant wait to get my stuff edited, completed, and uploaded when the times right. Thanks for your fuck ups lifting me up!
[2:57:46] <mostundesired> It's bigger than most shields

[2:58:50] <OwlLightningMage> The greatlance is also a big weapon
[2:58:51] <oneterriblemistake> its not as good as a shield but it can block some hits
[2:58:52] <NeroInfinite> great sword is for longer distances

[3:11:38] <Animorphimagi> it soudns like she wants to play DMC or Darksiders
[3:11:39] <SuspiciousEd> It's mostly because you're using a less upgraded weapon with shit stats for it.
[3:11:39] <switchadvictumexe> "magically"
[3:11:40] <+ArcLifth> Why does paige want to battle everyone on the big bridge

[3:11:48] <%DesertPenguin09> I missed the last two hours what did she do
[3:11:49] <Puhff> I think Paige would just prefer a nice hack and slash
[3:11:50] <$i_am_therydon> the enemies will despawn before she learns to play well.
[3:11:50] <OwlLightningMage> Chat is screaming for the grand lance LUL
[3:11:50] <Niney_Who> Mace or Craftsman Hammer could be good for Peach
[3:11:54] <lloyddboy> SUN IS DOWN

[3:11:56] <+MechaBaphomet> 8

[3:12:20] <derap41> The recovery is slower tho
[3:12:20] <Niney_Who> ????

[3:12:24] <%patriotrenegade> no
[3:12:24] <Ion_Laser> ???
[3:12:24] <Hydrapissed> same stamina but less recovery
[3:12:24] <@PlagueOfGripes> NO
[3:12:24] <Puhff> ...
[3:12:25] <SunnyD_Solaire> ??
[3:12:26] <tigerfang86> WHAT
[3:12:26] <%jobbedbone> uhhhhh
[3:12:26] <%Valdorick> But does it attack faster?
[3:12:26] <krymzen5> you could before
[3:12:26] <LokimenD> But how can paige see the white of their eyes if she's behind them? @PeachSaliva
[3:12:27] <+ArcLifth> But be farther away though
[3:12:27] <realm_forge> WHY
[3:12:28] <Monkeyweed21> YOU DONT WANT TO BE CLOSER
[3:12:28] <Niney_Who> YOU CAN GET CLOSE with the GREATSWORD TOO
[3:12:28] <%SoFarFetched> SHE WANTS TO FEEL THEIR SKIN A GAINST HERS
[3:12:28] <tigerfang86> HUH
[3:12:29] <Ion_Laser> WutFace
[3:12:30] <Hydrapissed> big sword has more recovery
[3:12:30] <Puhff> 2
[3:12:31] <TheButtravage> It's faster though.
[3:12:31] <pharaohaegyptus> YOU DONT NEED TO GET CLOSER IF YOUR SWORD IS LONGER
[3:12:33] <%CommanderSqueaks> PAIGE why do you insist on being bad?
[3:12:33] <%audrus> paige you can just be closer
[3:12:33] <+xBolts4Lifex> Jesus christ
[3:12:35] <andyspz> why would you WANT to get closer
[3:12:36] <%BaronVonMagpie> theres a lot less recovery
[3:12:36] <RupanSen> you have a better roll with bastard
[3:12:37] <Hydrapissed> shes faster with this one
[3:12:37] <+FoolsArcade> @PeachSaliva the difference is that she started counting swings again
[3:12:38] <LifesNeverHumDrum> she wants to facefuck ok
[3:12:39] <captainthunderwolf> The recovery from the swings is way worse on the big sword, Pat.
[3:12:39] <%Kuro_Koshka> Paige wants the wide swing of the 1H
[3:12:39] <%evermoore_hex> "I WANT TO DIE"
[3:12:40] <2fcd_twitch> It's still faster though
[3:12:40] <%QueequegTheater> SHE IS SAYING SHE WANTS BLOODBORNE
[3:12:40] <%patriotrenegade> Greatsword has a bigger sweet spot i guess
[3:12:40] <Niney_Who> @PeachSaliva Maybe she wants the horizontal swings
[3:12:41] <%romanticzomedy> she's saying she's too blind to swee with the greatsword
[3:12:42] <+MechaBaphomet> worse reach for less damage 4Head
[3:12:42] <lloyddboy> UNLEARNDING
[3:12:43] <RyuuAoi> You don't want to be closer. Keep your distance.
[3:12:44] <AirlineFood74> @PeachSaliva Pat push Grand Lance
[3:12:44] <Shishi1205> lost reach and damage for actually nothing
[3:12:44] <%Kuro_Koshka> and the faster swing
[3:12:44] <%Run44forrest> shes rolling after the attack NoLikeThis
[3:12:45] <Mortal_Wombat_I> You don’t WANT to be closer??
[3:12:45] <%CappuccinoGuil> Paige, Bastard Sword uses 3 swings to kill these guys. Greatsword uses 2 swings.
[3:12:45] <majindusto> HUGE COWARD
[3:12:45] <%BaronVonMagpie> theres tons of difference
[3:12:46] <%adolphinwizard> And then took all 3 hits
[3:12:46] <RadSuit> Roll directly into their swings Paige.
[3:12:46] <%QueequegTheater> BUT ITS NOT FUCKING BLOODBORNE
[3:12:47] <Hydrapissed> she wants the a.d.d swing and roll
[3:12:47] <SuspiciousEd> Ate that whole combo for lunch
[3:12:47] <Louie_Salmon> She wants to fuck their faces
[3:12:47] <HeavyC4> wow she getting worse
[3:12:48] <RadSuit> That's how to do it.

[3:12:49] <Shion963> maybe count swings with UGS
[3:12:50] <leole11> you ate every hit
[3:12:50] <Yum438> Let her use what she wants
[3:12:50] <@PlagueOfGripes> Paige is bad at the video game! Oh my god! Oh my goddddd

[3:12:54] <sasparillatango> it attacks faster
[3:12:56] <%zamatermort> Close is bad
[3:12:56] <%RafflesiaA> @PeachSaliva Remind her to count when she has the greatsword
[3:12:56] <+Pookiedaexzile> She really wants to play bloodborne
[3:12:56] <TehMud> LUL
[3:12:57] <@Calek> Paige will like the Greatsword R1 once she has enough strength to one hand it

[3:12:59] <Hydrapissed> Big sword have more dedication and recovery
[3:13:00] <MetalSlimeHunt> She wants to get closer because her vision range is six inches before the TV
[3:13:02] <+Pookiedaexzile> A not bad game

[3:13:03] <Burny01> is it paige's naptime soon?
[3:13:05] <Wintorz> it feels different though. she clearly feels confident with the shorter one
[3:13:07] <Blurredborderlines> it's almost like the iron knights are smacking her in the head going "WRONG, WRONG, WRONG"
[3:13:08] <Niney_Who> Enemies are apatBig
[3:13:09] <%Sphincter_Spelunker> we all do

[3:13:10] <TehMud> I'm getting Woolie flashbacks
[3:13:10] <%patriotrenegade> PLAY BLOODBORNE THEN
[3:13:11] <%BaronVonMagpie> if she doesnt want to play with the slab dont make her
[3:13:11] <%Admiral_PopnFresh> There is a difference, Paige will sacrifice range for horizontal hitbox, she wants a Dark Souls 3 straight sword
[3:13:12] <+TopTieramisu> bloodborne is the best
[3:13:12] <+MagickBurritoh> YOU ARE NOT BIG
[3:13:13] <RyuuAoi> THIS IS HOW WE DO IT

[3:13:18] <%arancet> yeah i cant play DS because its not bloodborne
[3:13:18] <kurejichi> Paige wants to ONE-HAND the greatsword. she wants WIDE swings
[3:13:19] <%jobbedbone> @PeachSaliva maybe its the horizontal swings get enough str to one hand the great sword for its one handed r1
[3:13:19] <realm_forge> It may seem overwhelming at first but you’ll get used to it
[3:13:20] <@PlagueOfGripes> are you suggesting Bloodborne is more thoughtless?
[3:13:20] <anar_bael> This is one of the most anti bloodborne game
[3:13:20] <Shishi1205> play it again it's right there
[3:13:21] <OswaldTheDog> SCIENCE !
[3:13:21] <%Sphincter_Spelunker> you're not big
[3:13:22] <+ArcLifth> stamnia = 0
[3:13:22] <%RafflesiaA> Honestly we all wish there was more bloodborne
[3:13:23] <Taliesin_> I think a lot of people who play DS2 wish they were playing Bloodborne tbh
[3:13:23] <Animorphimagi> played DMC or Darksiders
[3:13:24] <majindusto> Bloodborne too good
[3:13:24] <%ItsRatman> me too paige me too
[3:13:29] <ammobasket> DS2 bloodborne mod GO!
[3:13:29] <dabeaminator> Paige, if Bloodborne 2 came out you would still have to relearn everything.
[3:13:30] <RagingLeo> btw maces work great against dudes in armor

[3:13:34] <TheButtravage> @PlagueOfGripes We expect her to be bad, I just didn't want to see another Greatsword run in DS2 again.
[3:13:35] <cobax93> she gonna try Dark Souls 3?
[3:13:35] <DeathByPoke7> this is the opposite of bloodborne

[3:13:40] <+HelveticaScenario> She wants to mash, Pat. Bastard sword has a faster swing. Her brain wants what it wants
[3:13:40] <Shishi1205> rip
[3:13:40] <$Bncbck> then why not just PLAY DEX, ITS THE SAME, HONEST
[3:13:40] <+NobleJedi> I'm very curios how she'd do in Sekiro....
[3:13:41] <Niney_Who> @PeachSaliva Please let her try a Shield and Mace
[3:13:41] <+TheImmortal70> I sincerely wonder if she could beat blood borne again if she went back to it
[3:13:41] <OldDarkwraith> @PeachSaliva There are longer swords than the bastard sword, that aren't as difficult to use as the greatsword
[3:13:42] <HeavyC4> SOULS GONE
[3:13:42] <2fcd_twitch> why 3
[3:13:42] <%Keyd00d> SHE WAS BETTER BEFORE THIS SWORD

[3:13:44] <%adolphinwizard> Gotcha with the tip there
[3:13:44] <pharaohaegyptus> Paige, button press times three no
[3:13:45] <Rashnam> Not sure if Paige would be interested, but in case Pat hasn't mentioned it, the enemies in this area are super weak to blunt damage

[3:13:49] <+badchoice5> Bloodbourne engenders recklessness
[3:13:49] <%tylerpyre> That definitely uses mmore stamina
[3:13:49] <+FoolsArcade> @PeachSaliva you did it again, you stopped counting the enemies attacks
[3:13:49] <oneterriblemistake> paige never swing 3 times
[3:13:49] <%CommanderSqueaks> No, implying Bloodborne lends itself to a more in your face, aggressive gameplay style, where this is far more methodical and slow paced.

[3:14:05] <+FoolsArcade> Thank you Pat
[3:14:08] <%shiny_prinny> is the sword so big your depth perception is fucked?
[3:14:11] <%Lion_kun> swing twice and roll to safety
[3:14:12] <%Emperor_Machinus> BaBa is Sundown
[3:14:12] <LifesNeverHumDrum> ah yes, Balseks Paige, of the great Biggstrong line
[3:14:15] <realm_forge> Count the ballsacks
[3:14:16] <+FilthyHereticHorus> @PeachSaliva its not you, its the sword
[3:14:16] <TheBlankAce> Its just the sundown, the time for competency has ended\
[3:14:17] <+ArcLifth> Big count is big kills
[3:14:18] <%QueequegTheater> @PeachSaliva Is it possible that your ADHD is actually causing this?
[3:14:21] <snoozeaholic> Sun so down, he might as well be in Metal Gear Rising
[3:14:21] <eldragon_1> Just stop attacking 3 times. 2 and back off.
[3:14:23] <%Mendin> Try The Grand Lance
[3:14:23] <SuspiciousEd> Just depop them Kappa
[3:14:24] <@PlagueOfGripes> Paige gets tilted after sundown because the Earth is leaning to one side
[3:14:24] <VestigeOuroboros> Swing first
[3:14:24] <esbekay> stone ring rapier stagger most enemies
[3:14:25] <OwlLightningMage> We're never getting the Grand Lance
[3:14:27] <%chicken_danger> ballsex
[3:14:27] <Monkeyweed21> Paige's greatest enemy is her own hubris
[3:14:28] <+badchoice5> Just kill them til they get tired of your ass and don’t come back
[3:14:31] <luckyifpurple> Man should have just rolled dex and put everything into the Murakumo like a real one
[3:14:32] <Moonlight_Grimoire> so what it seems to be more of is she needs something that flails side to side over a vertical slice
[3:14:34] <majindusto> SAFETY DANCE
[3:14:35] <%Admiral_PopnFresh> Horizontal swing and the Greatsword rhythm is too slow for Paige
[3:14:35] <derap41> Remember Don't get Greedy
[3:14:36] <%umbypokochan> @PeachSaliva don't use a weapon that you don't find fun, it just ruins the game
[3:14:36] <Hydrapissed> Paige tilts with earth
[3:14:36] <tigerfang86> WOW
[3:14:37] <OwlLightningMage> Suggest it when Pat is gone.
[3:14:38] <Dr_Mooose> good idea
[3:14:40] <%QueequegTheater> VIG VIG VIG VIG
[3:14:40] <dabeaminator> No Pat, the advice in the chat is to use the Grand Lance.
[3:14:41] <+goose_attack_almanac> @PeachSaliva Paige, the weapon is bigger, but it's attacks are narrower and cost more stamina. You can still bait enemies into your R2 after two swings.
[3:14:41] <%DesuDesuDokiDoki> nah
[3:14:43] <%patriotrenegade> Graaaaaaand Laaaaaance
[3:14:44] <%Sphincter_Spelunker> just kill them 12 times
[3:14:47] <%BaronVonMagpie> good, grand lance would be awful to watch
[3:14:49] <12gagerager> Timing is absolutely crucial with bigfer swords.
[3:14:50] <Monkeyweed21> THATS WRONG PAT
[3:14:50] <krymzen5> no such thing
[3:14:51] <Niney_Who> @PeachSaliva Maybe paige prefers a faster horizontal-swinging weapon and doesn't care for range
[3:14:51] <%Valdorick> Streamers can't GET overleveled
[3:14:52] <Shishi1205> if you get the counter swing they only take 2 hits
[3:14:53] <sheevabestwaifu> Hit and run with greatsword
[3:14:54] <Louie_Salmon> Pretty sure about right
[3:14:54] <%RafflesiaA> Who caaaares just get huge
[3:14:55] <%Nobrev> it also looks like you have a mid roll with the greatsword and a lighter roll with the bastard sword
[3:14:55] <HeavyC4> it less about levels and more about weapons. you need a blunt weapon
[3:14:55] <sharpington_> @PeachSaliva Remember how many swings you get before you run out of stamina
[3:14:56] <+FilthyHereticHorus> that sword is a slow piece of garbo
[3:14:57] <%stovetopism> Get more STR, VIT, END, VIG
[3:14:58] <%QueequegTheater> @PeachSaliva Paige if you finish this game + DLCs below 175 you did it wrong

[3:15:01] <%BaronVonMagpie> do thou forget woolies partizan
[3:15:01] <Puhff> fuck it!
[3:15:03] <Moonlight_Grimoire> you can't get overleveled in a dark souls game
[3:15:03] <+badchoice5> Pats acceptable level goes up every time he’s asked
[3:15:03] <Graxe_> Yeah, could just kill them until they stop respawning
[3:15:05] <TheButtravage> @PeachSaliva Anytime you ask that question, the answer is always "yes."
[3:15:06] <snoozeaholic> Should invest in a rapier if they want babymode

[3:16:37] <+ArcLifth> if you can get 3 swings and have stamina will be good for you
[3:16:41] <+Mekhet09> You should level up the weapon.

[3:16:53] <+Mekhet09> @PeachSaliva You should see if you can level up the weapon.
[3:16:55] <$Solidnick18> yeah 2
[3:16:55] <%Sphincter_Spelunker> r2
[3:16:58] <Puhff> 2 swings and a roll
[3:16:58] <+FoolsArcade> @PeachSaliva you need Stamina like a Elmo needs to eat his own fur
[3:17:00] <dabeaminator> At this point Pat is obviously ignoring the Lance advice for some reason. He must not like it.
[3:17:03] <sheevabestwaifu> 1 swing
[3:17:05] <GarbageQueenEllie> The ol' 1 2
[3:17:07] <Cryomancer_Maurice> at this point she might just be better laming it out with a **spear**
[3:17:09] <pharaohaegyptus> No Pat, don't say that last part
[3:17:09] <Shishi1205> they usually die from 3
[3:17:10] <cgmerryo> ADP is useless if you're a shield pleb

[3:17:27] <%Run44forrest> dont roll just strafe
[3:17:32] <TheButtravage> @dabeaminator Pat wants greatsword in all DS2 gameplay.
[3:17:32] <%LodiFrostbeard> @dabeaminator why re yall so obsessed with the lance? it sucks
[3:17:38] <%QueequegTheater> @PeachSaliva If you want to facefuck, use the Grand Lance. It's literally custom built for that exact purpose
[3:17:40] <Shishi1205> counter swing and another r1 and easy
[3:17:40] <Mortal_Wombat_I> Why not just fight him in the arena?
[3:17:40] <%Papa_Tak> yeah adp doesnt really do anything when she doesnt roll
[3:17:44] <%Estuko> @PeachSaliva Also great for murdering Plague
[3:17:46] <$Solidnick18> like that one boss
[3:17:53] <%stovetopism> Dual greatword or riot
[3:17:56] <+MagickBurritoh> so early
[3:17:57] <%Keyd00d> those early rolls are disgusting
[3:18:02] <LokimenD> Clean
[3:18:03] <dabeaminator> The Lance has a fantastic moveset and A Strength scaling.

[3:18:17] <+FoolsArcade> @PeachSaliva Patrick, Tell her that there are moves that she doesn't have to roll away from, she may benefit from just sidestepping those overheads from the big bois

[3:18:59] <+FoolsArcade> @PeachSaliva Its almost like you slow down and do better!!
[3:18:59] <Laironx3> vineChamp
[3:19:01] <+Pookiedaexzile> Shes starting to believe
[3:19:02] <OwlLightningMage> Everyone in chat wants her to tru the Grand Lance LUL
[3:19:04] <%chicken_danger> GETTING HUGE
[3:19:05] <worldbrand> what we should do instead is push weapons for people to invade her with
[3:19:08] <%QueequegTheater> G R A N D L A N C E
[3:19:10] <%evermoore_hex> grand lance is so far away
[3:19:10] <+Devildragon911> Maybe she should try it one handed?
[3:19:12] <VestigeOuroboros> lance armstrong only has 1 testicle
[3:19:13] <TurtlesAndTentacles> Bitch ass White Knight
[3:19:13] <+Kataguro> I wonder if Paige should jump attack
[3:19:13] <%Estuko> @Tyonidus it super sucks, lol. I just wanted to go home by the end of the day, finally home and eating a warm crisp bun with some cheese. Poor happy dinner lol
[3:19:14] <Moonlight_Grimoire> down up roll, down up roll
[3:19:14] <Niney_Who> You're bigger than Sword Heides but not the Spear Heides
[3:19:14] <%stovetopism> Stay with the Greatsword!
[3:19:17] <+SubparScrub> Fuck up Queequeg
[3:19:17] <+xBolts4Lifex> Drink your mustard
[3:19:17] <SunnyD_Solaire> i love their weird movements
[3:19:18] <%QueequegTheater> Grance Lance for Summer Slam
[3:19:18] <RyuuAoi> BIG DICK HOURS
[3:19:19] <%BaronVonMagpie> I specifically do not want her to try the grand lance
[3:19:20] <Hydrapissed> @supercasualboom idk cant see it
[3:19:21] <%Finakala> Grand Lance is super lategame though isn't it?
[3:19:21] <eldragon_1> Good. Just remember only 2
[3:19:21] <Kingtweedy> wow, complete 180 in a second, this enemy is bs lol
[3:19:23] <Shishi1205> already forgot the only 2 swings thing
[3:19:25] <+Tyonidus> @Estuko aw yiss
[3:19:26] <GarbageQueenEllie> That's what she said
[3:19:26] <sheevabestwaifu> Gunlance
[3:19:26] <%jobbedbone> stop trying to make grand lance happen. It will never be a thing
[3:19:28] <$RubberFistFight> yeah trying to save time is the quickest way to waste time in this game.
[3:19:29] <%patriotrenegade> @evermoore_hex its in her nventory
[3:19:30] <xeros720> BIG STRONG SLOW is the way to go
[3:19:32] <%LodiFrostbeard> SWITCH TO SWORD AND BOARD
[3:19:32] <%QueequegTheater> @Finakala Not in Scholar, she already has it
[3:19:34] <S8ntrick2> What's the Goal? Orienstien 2?
[3:19:35] <$RubberFistFight> going slow is ironically much faster.
[3:19:37] <LokimenD> We need to push Grand Lance for Summerslam
[3:19:38] <LifesNeverHumDrum> dont let your ADD win, fight it. With a big sword~
[3:19:38] <SuspiciousEd> @worldbrand unfortunately Mr. Shakedown is gonna consume all the invasion windows with shitty meme invasions
[3:19:41] <%patriotrenegade> GRAND LANCE IS BETTER
[3:19:41] <NeroInfinite> Prefer faster wepaons pat
[3:19:42] <Tucker0603> but it boring
[3:19:42] <%Finakala> Oh fair, only played vanilla
[3:19:44] <+NobleJedi> that's very good advice. just slow the fuck down
[3:19:44] <%stovetopism> The Greatsword is the best things about DS2
[3:19:44] <TheButtravage> Someone invade her with a bigger strong weapon so she wants that instead.
[3:19:47] <%DesuDesuDokiDoki> nice
[3:19:50] <%supercasualboom> @hydrapissed Yeah it said share reward with 3 others so I have no idea.
[3:19:53] <worldbrand> yeah how is he getting so many invasions anyway?
[3:19:53] <%chicken_danger> r a n g e
[3:19:55] <Shishi1205> too close
[3:19:58] <S8ntrick2> I'm a real Gamer Boy, I use magic
[3:20:01] <reiju_22> just pick a top tier weapon atpRtsd
[3:20:03] <snoozeaholic> Someone invade her with a fume UGS
[3:20:04] <Hydrapissed> @supercasualboom said something about a fight box
[3:20:05] <+Pixel_Matt> PowerUpL EarthDay PowerUpR
[3:20:05] <%patriotrenegade> Someone invade her with the King's Ultragreatsword
[3:20:06] <%QueequegTheater> Shakedown, invade and murder her with the grand lance
[3:20:07] <%waterstealer> RETHINK YOUR ROLLS
[3:20:09] <+MagickBurritoh> Take those hits
[3:20:09] <ClumzyDragon> rooBlank
[3:20:10] <Thenuclearwalrus> BIG AND STRONG
[3:20:10] <%Valdorick> I got it! Just go with a str/faith build and use the defenders greatsword (on past 1.0) Kappa
[3:20:11] <patismyhero> Strong and Weak
[3:20:12] <+FoolsArcade> @PeachSaliva Its ok to take a hit if you don't die
[3:20:12] <+forevermasterless> if she doesn't like the lance it's w/e but there's literally no reason not to at least try it for two seconds.
[3:20:13] <%QueequegTheater> GRAND LANCE IS BETTER
[3:20:14] <tigerfang86> just pick a top tier
[3:20:14] <%evermoore_hex> someone invade and just drop the Fume Ultra
[3:20:18] <+SubparScrub> Someone invade for the love of god
[3:20:19] <OwlLightningMage> @QueequegTheater I second this
[3:20:20] <%bluetocho13> yo you wanna learn how to do a fuckin infinite?
[3:20:20] <Sir_Kino> good job sword
[3:20:21] <RyuuAoi> That was fair, @peachsaliva !
[3:20:21] <Shishi1205> scales pretty good
[3:20:22] <$RubberFistFight> JUST THE TIP
[3:20:23] <Niney_Who> But it does shit damage
[3:20:24] <%QueequegTheater> LET HER TRY IT ONCE PAT
[3:20:24] <%JonEWorldbeater> Isn't it just Guts' sword?
[3:20:24] <$Solidnick18> just the tip
[3:20:24] <+Mekhet09> @PeachSaliva Use L1 to block you'd take less damage.
[3:20:24] <%DesuDesuDokiDoki> just pick a top tier
[3:20:25] <%Sphincter_Spelunker> weapon loyalty LUL just pick a top tier
[3:20:25] <HeavyC4> pick a weapon you want paige, not the top tier
[3:20:27] <%supercasualboom> I just hope they get my music references in my last two donations.
[3:20:28] <krymzen5> she has suprisingly good spacing
[3:20:30] <Niney_Who> Fight him on the STEPS
[3:20:30] <SuspiciousEd> @worldbrand Networking hacks I would assume. There was an invader in Woolie's DS1 playthrough who explained to him that was a thing
[3:20:31] <%stovetopism> Throw the great lance into the water
[3:20:31] <tigerfang86> DEX CREW IS HERE
[3:20:32] <+NobleJedi> she could always press L1, but that might be too much info for her tho.....
[3:20:32] <%CaptainKarite> sbfpScared
[3:20:33] <Shion963> man I'm reconsidering my Drangleic Sword now
[3:20:37] <%LodiFrostbeard> @bluetocho13 can she even uise it?
[3:20:39] <%RafflesiaA> Don't drop fugs that's gonna be super silly
[3:20:40] <%adolphinwizard> *the absolute tip*
[3:20:41] <worldbrand> @SuspiciousEd that's a real bummer
[3:20:42] <snoozeaholic> Did they ever pick up the giant seeds from all those invasions?
[3:20:43] <juxtest> Kill him to death
[3:20:44] <GarbageQueenEllie> heheh
[3:20:44] <%Admiral_PopnFresh> I'm not a fan of oversized weapons, except speares
[3:20:44] <tigerfang86> DEX CREW VS GREATSWORD
[3:20:48] <Darmarock> inb4 ded in 2 secons
[3:20:50] <Shion963> approach him and slam
[3:20:52] <Intolerable> I just got home. Did Pat get that sword for her?
[3:20:54] <+FoolsArcade> @PeachSaliva His spear might be shorter but all his moves have forward momentum
[3:20:54] <leole11> i hate this piece of shit
[3:20:57] <%Sphincter_Spelunker> "his spear is smaller than my sword" ha
[3:21:01] <%alex_id> YEYEYE

[3:30:22] <Intolerable> Why no open chest??
[3:30:26] <%adolphinwizard> The smoke increases
[3:30:27] <tigerfang86> the most challenging concept
[3:30:29] <%chicken_danger> YOU CAN BACK OFF ALOT OF HIS ATTACKS WITHOUT ROLLING AFTER THE FIRST ROLL
[3:30:35] <MetalSlimeHunt> Doggo cometh
[3:30:36] <SulfurousAcid> roll late on the comand grab
[3:30:39] <%legendfather_of_giants> @PeachSaliva you can hit him while he spawns
[3:30:40] <DracaenaLeaf> that door is open
[3:30:40] <Shishi1205> you can actually hit him while he appears
[3:30:44] <$Bane_Kaikyo> The Pursuer is so cool tho
[3:30:44] <Saltmeisterr> its mister x
[3:30:48] <+FoolsArcade> @PeachSaliva You don't have to ROLL away from all of Pursuers moves, a lot of them you can side step
[3:30:49] <Dr_Mooose> dogoos

[3:40:20] <%chicken_danger> delete pomf
[3:40:20] <%cureneckbeard> free hugs
[3:40:21] <%RadicalWeegee> At fur cons they do it to friends
[3:40:22] <RadSuit> Those were the days.
[3:40:22] <serra255> i was arround for that
[3:40:22] <TheBlankAce> Glomping died a while ago
[3:40:24] <%THATGUY_789> Pat hates human interaction
[3:40:24] <LifesNeverHumDrum> we suffered on the glomp cross for the children of now
[3:40:24] <+jessedouglas> @PeachSaliva nope im wrong it says it $13 on the american store (erica)
[3:40:28] <+Kataguro> It's current year
[3:40:29] <%supercasualboom> Whose that Pokémon???? It’s Glomp....!?!?!
[3:40:29] <Dr_Mooose> that's good
[3:40:30] <Habblewater> I always thought GLOMP was like, semi vore or something, some hideous anime creature clamping on to someone face like a lamprey
[3:40:31] <Rhinoprotoss> Cause you might die
[3:40:32] <%Sphincter_Spelunker> this is why people hated anime. not cuz they couldn't name 15 gokus
[3:40:32] <Mr_Strut> I should rewatch ranma
[3:40:35] <CrimsonFox777> NOT a furry
[3:40:36] <+VanaSkiller> not lookin to get metoo'd
[3:40:36] <%RadicalWeegee> YUP!
[3:40:37] <+starkandstag> apatGoblin
[3:40:37] <%GalacticaPhanto> remember yaoi paddles?
[3:40:39] <%DesuDesuDokiDoki> FURRIES ARE CONTAGIOUS
[3:40:40] <zamzoph> you don't know where those fursuits have been
[3:40:42] <+tweedler92> Wholesome
[3:40:42] <+Hoisengineer> there's a report of one poor person getting their hip shattered by that
[3:40:43] <%Keyd00d> 2 years worth of semen glomped into her
[3:40:44] <Hazard_Kujacker> as THEY FUCKING SHOULD
[3:40:44] <%waltzqueen> YAOI PADDLES ARE EVIL
[3:40:47] <investorscratchit> ASK FOR CONSENT CON
[3:40:48] <%Yaruzu> There used to be a wooden paddle called the yaoi paddle and there was an incident where someone hit a random person with the side of it and broke their pelvis
[3:40:50] <+DukeMoose> like that story of the guy who walks with a cane because some giant horbeast weeb glomper broke his mcfucking leg?
[3:40:50] <%SoFarFetched> They dont allow it much now
[3:40:51] <%Amingingchicken> Amingingchicken subscribed with Twitch Prime. 
[3:40:54] <%Estuko> @Sphincter_Spelunker lmfao, I love anime and video games. I hard avoided the anime/video game club in my school.
[3:40:54] <$Rumbutt> Part of the reason for that is probably all the fucking glomps
[3:40:55] <%rumtumtugnutz> It's like a fart in a mascot costume.
[3:40:56] <squirtkitten> tobiasCREEP
[3:40:57] <HyperBomb21> A tackle hug would probably kill Paige
[3:40:58] <%chicken_danger> Weirdos need to keep weird congregated, fight me
[3:40:58] <%cureneckbeard> They had to ban yaoi paddles after a dude got hit by one and got a broken hip
[3:41:00] <%jiin6> if paige get Glomped, she get broke in half
[3:41:00] <Laironx3> yeah always ask
[3:41:00] <Sheepeze> Glomping seems like a good way to get an ass kicking
[3:41:01] <%GalacticaPhanto> yaoi paddles are tools of satan
[3:41:03] <$Draylle> even back then it seemed inappropriate
[3:41:03] <%THATGUY_789> it's where Paige got the Lupus from the wolf furry
[3:41:03] <%BaronVonMagpie> I got glomped at an anime con and I wasnt even cosplaying
[3:41:03] <%waltzqueen> YAOI PADDLES ARE STILL ILLGEAL AT CONS
[3:41:04] <kasios> oh god I'm late aren't i
[3:41:05] <Animorphimagi> I'll glomp you next time I see you Paige...
[3:41:07] <CrimsonFox777> @DesuDesuDokiDoki There's actually an SCP with that premise.

[3:54:38] <VJdarkworld> why we fucking letters
[3:54:38] <%ShichiNoBushi> It's attached to the X chromosome, and Y is submissive to X.

[3:55:10] <RyuuAoi> Wait...I just noticed the matching PJ pants! @peachsaliva
[3:55:10] <+Th3SmartAlec> @MelBrooksKA Wait, like 1/20 men are colorblind?!
[3:55:10] <$nademonkey1100> stay away from hong kong
[3:55:11] <TheFilth> still weird that people dreamt in black & white before TV
[3:55:13] <%DesertPenguin09> IT can be monochrome if it's that bad
[3:55:14] <derekwst3> girls are more likely to have better differences with color but they can be colerblind
[3:55:15] <%TeraMercier> Holy shit 8 percent is a lot
[3:55:15] <%Nobrev> be INCREDIBLY cautious if you're going to china right now

[3:56:04] <@MelBrooksKA> @Th3SmartAlec And a lot of people don't know it till someone puts up a chart showing color blindness and goes "I can"
[3:56:08] <%stovetopism> @rumtumtugnutz depends on the type, very rare. people cannot see any color
[3:56:12] <@MelBrooksKA> I can't tell the difference
[3:56:26] <%Nobrev> @a_mad_dragon i believe so but you don't lose anything either
[3:56:30] <dabeaminator> Get ready for Recession 2

[3:56:42] <%Yaruzu> THE SUN
[3:56:43] <%Keyd00d> Yes
[3:56:45] <+Th3SmartAlec> THE SUN TOLD ME TO DO IT
[3:56:46] <@MelBrooksKA> Red-green color blindness is the most common, other ones aren't that common
[3:56:46] <Shishi1205> the number circles you mean?
[3:56:51] <%Mister_McDerp> that damn sun did it again
[3:56:52] <%Keyd00d> the sun told me

[3:57:12] <+Kataguro> Paige would love Sunless Sea. There's never a sun to go down. Until there is.
[3:57:13] <%rumtumtugnutz> @stovetopism it could be argued that achromatopsia is different from color blindness.
[3:57:14] <%arancet> a little TOO paige
