[0:18:43] <Vaunno> pc gaming 🙃
[0:18:45] <hereiam407> Is this on PC?
[0:18:55] <+maria_luke> shapes are now LETTERS
[0:19:00] <Paralurx> I like how they went to splash screen so we wouldn't hear Pat praying to the machine spirits
[0:19:06] <+imthewisejanitor> @storytayl0r It fits nicely if you use 4 "mas"
[0:19:08] <xxHungryxx> And now, the Bloodring of Eldensouls
[0:19:09] <mrducksauce> I get stutters too
[0:19:13] <mrducksauce> It's annoying
[0:19:15] <razz_zie> Hi Paige, I like ur jacket romollaPeek
[0:19:18] <%greasypete00> it's was worse today than it was yesterday when I played
[0:19:22] <+Taisuru> Hopefully they get those stutters sorted out
[0:19:24] <SulfurousAcid> I've had some big stutters on my ps4 pro just playing ds3
[0:19:24] <YakumoYomi> Elden Ring is a little weird on PC right now. Stuttering is a big problem for a lot of people (myself included)
[0:19:24] <mrducksauce> Mostly when you are fighting 5 guys
[0:19:26] <yukichocomilk> mine drops fps a lot but my pc is old so i cna't complain. at least it runs
[0:19:31] <hereiam407> Yes
[0:19:33] <Danitaras> wha wha
[0:19:33] <%Dakuu75> 100% all the frame issues are on the game's end. don't worry.

[0:19:46] <SulfurousAcid> I see and then I hear
[0:19:48] <storytayl0r> Just wear one sleeve of the jacket
[0:19:49] <Paralurx> I can see the sounds
[0:19:50] <+PrimalDweeb> The image is heard
[0:19:53] <hereiam407> I saw Giantbomb play this on Steam Deck, and it was stuttering. I was wondering if it was the Deck or just the game.
[0:19:54] <PanicSwytch> ...i canh hear the image
[0:20:00] <+maria_luke> oh it is Bandai Namco lol
[0:20:03] <%SaiyanShoto> I just realized I’d that Pats shirt? LUL
[0:20:06] <Vaunno> stutters are secretly manipulated by the day and weather monkaS @greasypete00

[0:33:16] <hereiam407> I'm enjoying this medieval feel
[0:33:25] <+Alopekis> They're runes. Completely different.
[0:33:33] <StarOtter70> Legally distinct
[0:33:40] <+Alopekis> Illegally distinct
[0:33:52] <xxHungryxx> Your souls would be outside the arena where you fight him so it's safe @peachsaliva
[0:33:59] <Vaunno> can't believe shes abandoning her blood echoes like that

[0:35:20] <%cade_calrayn> What are you looking for? Can you describe it?

[0:36:15] <dds333a> They got goons
[0:36:29] <Vaunno> @t_sasquatch + fated to die in obscurity
[0:36:30] <SixxMakaveli> It's super windy
[0:36:41] <xxHungryxx> Stealth gameplay
[0:37:08] <Vaunno> she snek
[0:37:27] <%Dakuu75> I feel like the Stealth, is a great way to even the odds when you have to fight 50 dudes at once. more fair.
[0:37:29] <xxHungryxx> you can also roll while sneaking
[0:37:32] <+NopeBadguy> A NEW BREED OF STEALTH
[0:37:36] <T_Sasquatch> Its funny to see people play because i refuse to stealth in games that aren't specifically stealth games
[0:37:45] <+SWFanatic> nice
[0:37:51] <BigFingerRo> Oh man, the stutter
[0:37:59] <Vaunno> oh god monkaFPS
[0:38:08] <BigFingerRo> game looks amazing but man am I glad I waited
[0:38:37] <+vehementvadr> Paige, master of stealth, until she gets caught
[0:38:50] <xxHungryxx> Just play the whole game crouching
[0:39:05] <Vaunno> god those trees ARE twerking
[0:39:06] <twistedj3ster> I'm running it on High on a 1650m, no idea why I got lucky
[0:39:09] <%Dakuu75> From what I heard the game is intentionally using less resources, than your PC actually has. I dunno why
[0:39:16] <Jetsfantasy> Yeah. I've had to change some stuff but it's rough. Changing shader cache settings in Nvidia control panel and switching over to Nvme hard drive helped a lot
[0:39:26] <BigFingerRo> Castle Super Beast Crest
[0:39:34] <+Alopekis> I have Wendy's
[0:39:41] <%Dakuu75> @BigFingerRo yo. doodShake

[0:40:54] <+SWFanatic> Zangief could eat those dogs
[0:41:15] <Sir_Carl> Man, watching other people play this makes me feel like a crazy person for the route I took
[0:41:21] <IamGrapes> it's office paige!
[0:41:40] <Vaunno> wild skeleman attacks!
[0:41:51] <+Namillus> "how to make parry even more satisfying - it works on mounted enemies"

[0:50:29] <%cade_calrayn> how many times have you embraced the booba lady, Paige?
[0:50:31] <Parapattern> It's odd seeing so many Souls NPCs wearing such bright colors
[0:50:34] <+Alopekis> @ExpressNode I can't beat him. I've tried everything. I even had a giant jellyfish on my side and I couldn't beat him.
[0:50:35] <%Sotetsu> Wait, did Paige beat that boss in the castle gate?
[0:50:54] <RyuuAoi> Edge Lord
[0:51:04] <eduwardovich> Love a nice, salty Bloody Mary. Do you use pickle juice?

[0:51:34] <%cade_calrayn> oh it's Ofnir again. The asshat
[0:51:40] <ExpressNode> @alopekis I explored a bit and got some physicks for stamina and charges for Samurai and used skills.  The Iai skills take a chunk off
[0:51:41] <$KnightOfTrousers> Is this just Sean Bean?
[0:51:44] <+Alopekis> What if I don't want to be the Elden Lord? What if I just wanna kill stuff?
[0:51:45] <xxHungryxx> @alopekis He has a Micky mouse voice
[0:52:06] <+SWFanatic> Oh that was GRRM's advice, Just get Sean Bean to read everything
[0:52:14] <buuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuut> What about wisdom of the pinky?
[0:52:15] <+Alopekis> @xxHungryxx He just buys his way to being the Elden Lord.
[0:52:22] <DancesWitBalrog> wait, he's a Lord? I don't get it
[0:52:34] <%cade_calrayn> that's Sir Gideon Ofnir
[0:52:37] <%cade_calrayn> the All-Knowing
[0:52:39] <%cade_calrayn> he's kind of a dick
[0:53:01] <eduwardovich> @cade_calrayn or a douche-canoe, if you will.
[0:53:02] <+Alopekis> @cade_calrayn You leave Sir Geidon Ofnir, the All-Knowing alone!
[0:53:02] <Vaunno> @cade_calrayn i wonder if he knows that too
[0:53:03] <Aussie_Manny> bartender lmao

[0:53:21] <ExpressNode> @alopekis I think I also used the wolves summons
[0:53:29] <%thejimjamz> man nihilistic smiths are a strong trope
[0:53:33] <Aussie_Manny> It's Pat, but taller and with less barnacles.
[0:53:34] <eduwardovich> You appear to be covered in barnacles, sir...
[0:53:36] <DancesWitBalrog> me
[0:53:39] <Vaunno> oooh
[0:53:53] <+Alopekis> @ExpressNode Yeah I tried the wolves too. I think I just need to explore until my character is OP cause I'm bad at this game. lol

[0:54:13] <+imthewisejanitor> This is such an in-depth dating sim.
[0:54:16] <Aussie_Manny> "Can you give her this note? I'm too a-scared to do it myself."
[0:54:19] <+Alopekis> It would be unethical for them to kiss
[0:54:23] <eduwardovich> Notice me, senpai

[0:56:59] <+Taisuru> Ye
[0:57:04] <eduwardovich> I feel like he may be inspired by Hephaestus in Greek mythology. God of the forge, also said to be hunchbacked/disfigured.
[0:57:11] <ExpressNode> For me I plan on Dex now and maybe branch of it seems good
[0:57:20] <hereiam407> The undead assasin
[0:57:25] <+Alopekis> @eduwardovich But did Hephaestus get the girl?
[0:57:32] <Vaunno> black knife in th episs fountain, classic trope

[1:00:18] <hereiam407> Giant walking bell castle
[1:00:20] <+Alopekis> Yup
[1:00:22] <+MattyNezz> It's Bloodbourne flavored, but it's mostly just corn syrup
[1:00:27] <+Alopekis> They're like mini dungeons
[1:00:30] <Vaunno> beast dickery is automatically bloodborne
[1:00:35] <80sHairMetalFan> Yum, yum, youm!!!!
[1:00:36] <DancesWitBalrog> Bloodborne so thick I can hoont it
[1:00:42] <%cade_calrayn> Yeah these catacombs are always small with a boss
[1:01:08] <+Alopekis> You can't kill a skeleton
[1:01:16] <thegurubutcher> Sup
[1:01:42] <+MattyNezz> We know why
[1:01:48] <+Alopekis> Gotta make sure their head is on properly. Would be embarrassing if they attacked you and it fell off.
[1:01:58] <+Taisuru> Someone needs to make a mod to give the hug woman a "Free Huge" shirt
[1:02:08] <+Taisuru> *Free hugs

[1:02:41] <Jetsfantasy> "Free Huge" strewn across vast mountains
[1:02:46] <+imthewisejanitor> f r e e  h uu g e
[1:02:48] <xxHungryxx> Huge should ALWAYS be free
[1:02:50] <MarlooRedd> Huge did nothing wrong
[1:02:58] <secret_npc> INT up to 18 at least
[1:03:08] <IamGrapes> Plage's Huge Quest?
[1:03:12] <+Alopekis> Put Faith up to 30
[1:03:12] <secret_npc> magic weapon
[1:03:14] <%cade_calrayn> Bump Endurance and Strength til you hit caps
[1:03:19] <+DoktahDoktah> Whats teh games soft and hard caps?
[1:03:26] <tanarath> Strm
[1:03:30] <sirrice77> idk if she should bump faith or int when they're already so low
[1:03:30] <eduwardovich> Stamina. You do tend to spam dodge a lot...
[1:03:31] <%Dakuu75> the bigger summons cost like 100-FP
[1:03:32] <tanarath> Str*
[1:03:39] <+StevenTheUnicorn> bababooey
[1:03:46] <xxHungryxx> I'd say worry about your main stats for now
[1:03:48] <+MattyNezz> There are a lot of BIG SWORDS for BIG DAMAGE that need at least some of one of the magic stats
[1:03:49] <secret_npc> there's some neat fresh INT and Faith weapons in this one
[1:03:50] <%strakillias> I agree with End Str to 30. but do 20 End then nothin but Str until 30
[1:03:52] <+Alopekis> Take notes
[1:03:59] <%cade_calrayn> The wolves take 55 FP, they're great
[1:04:02] <+whyskeywolfe> she has lupus
[1:04:15] <secret_npc> but man, that endurance though
[1:04:16] <+MattyNezz> One of them costs 104
[1:04:16] <+Alopekis> The wolves are fun
[1:04:20] <%Sotetsu> I have 100 FP at 23 int
[1:04:20] <+Alopekis> And the giant jellyfish
[1:04:24] <twistedj3ster> The D in AD stands for damage
[1:04:26] <+DoktahDoktah> Got a nice moonlight greatsword like weapon. So that weapon hitting harder is nice. It seems like you can get alot of swings with it so stamina doesn't seem like a big issue.
[1:04:26] <+reaver93> Im hating all the odd numbers hahaha
[1:04:37] <+Alopekis> Big McLarge Huge
[1:04:38] <%cade_calrayn> Strength and Endurance to cap
[1:04:49] <%Bloomingzonda> 50 in arcane
[1:04:53] <+whyskeywolfe> right now more dex
[1:04:59] <%Sotetsu> I found a big weapon that takes 32 str
[1:04:59] <Vaunno> @reaver93 uuugh i haaate it
[1:05:02] <%cade_calrayn> You're good with FP for now, since you've got enough for the wolves
[1:05:05] <+StevenTheUnicorn> MORE BIG
[1:05:11] <+whyskeywolfe> you straight cant use a bunch of weapons with that low dex
[1:05:12] <tanarath> Str/Vig/End w/ some Mind for fp?
[1:05:16] <+StevenTheUnicorn> STR STR MORE BIG
[1:05:16] <+Alopekis> Bump whichever attribute is going to be least helpful
[1:05:29] <twistedj3ster> bump dex a little, as a treat
[1:05:30] <+MattyNezz> The Guts Sword needs 31 Str
[1:05:31] <%DiscoMatador> anyone know if there are respec items in this game?
[1:05:31] <%cade_calrayn> I'd say find a weapon that you like, and build towards it
[1:05:39] <eduwardovich> Agreed
[1:05:40] <+ajeanstarks78 > one  weapon has 40 str
[1:05:45] <sirrice77> i would get dex to like 14
[1:05:50] <%Bloomingzonda> There are strength weapons that need 15 Dex
[1:05:50] <+whyskeywolfe> yay i feel seen
[1:05:52] <secret_npc> apparently there's a respec later, if that makes any of this easier
[1:05:52] <+DoktahDoktah> Tell nobody you put points into dex. Infact like right now just to cover it up. Those were totally points in STR.
[1:05:53] <Vaunno> up those decks
[1:05:53] <%Sotetsu> Don't forget to up Dog, too.
[1:05:58] <+Alopekis> Can you get a machine gun in this game?
[1:06:19] <Aussie_Manny> What's up dog?
[1:06:24] <+Alopekis> Don't forget Henway either.
[1:06:26] <+StevenTheUnicorn> there's an item you can buy that helps against Margey
[1:06:27] <+DoktahDoktah> @secret_npc Thats super cool if true.
[1:06:30] <+MattyNezz> Only as a rare lootbox drop
[1:06:30] <+Dunder_Mifflinz> @Alopekis It's on PC. So give it like a week
[1:06:38] <+Chewygamer> good luck with this motherfucker he is not a nice man
[1:06:45] <Aussie_Manny> Oh, this fight? Cool.

[1:07:07] <Ell1ot> i have pizza and churro. today is good day
[1:07:07] <adelym0> you also gotta be in a specific area to summon, there'll be a glyph on the left side
[1:07:11] <Anderobot> They’re items like estus
[1:07:12] <IamGrapes> summons are an item and you summon them while fighting the boss
[1:07:12] <+Chewygamer> just scroll down its a jellyfish
[1:07:14] <%Bloomingzonda> like you use it like an item
[1:07:19] <+Alopekis> Jellyfish
[1:07:22] <+reaver93> Pat knows where it is
[1:07:27] <IamGrapes> i would reccomend jellyfish
[1:07:31] <+StevenTheUnicorn> it stuns him, a vendor sells it
[1:07:32] <Jetsfantasy> Jellyfish is a fuckin' BRO
[1:07:35] <+Alopekis> Oh yeah, I heard there was an item but I couldn't find it
[1:07:36] <sirrice77> Do you want hints to find it?

[1:11:29] <Zeif00> tbf there is good shit in every direction
[1:11:32] <+Alopekis> Is there a lore reason why the enemies in Souls games are always so much bigger than the normal people?

[1:30:03] <+Taisuru> lol Patches you shit
[1:30:15] <%ceremight> Yes you do
[1:30:17] <+Alopekis> Patches is probably the craziest character in all of the Souls games.
[1:30:17] <%cade_calrayn> @PeachSaliva  now, if you leave and rest at a grace, and come back, he's a vendor
[1:30:19] <BigFingerRo> BEAT HIM LIKE A RENTED MULE

[1:30:41] <PlatinumWyvern> he sells the item for margit
[1:30:44] <SpencerSDH> He moves to another location. You'll see him later on.
[1:30:51] <heartlesshealer> as long as he's outdoors you can always kill him
[1:30:58] <%Dakuu75> (since she found him) Anyone know if he gets pissed, when you try to open his second chest?
[1:31:02] <+Alopekis> Patches has always been the real hero of the Souls franchise.
[1:31:02] <+Taisuru> PATCHES WHEEL PATCHES DEAL
[1:31:13] <%cade_calrayn> WHEEL AND DEAL
[1:31:20] <+StevenTheUnicorn> sick threads m8

[1:31:33] <+TheRagabash> sit at the grace and then go back and see what he sells!
[1:31:34] <%cade_calrayn> Of course!
[1:31:35] <SpencerSDH> Patches unnaturally clean bald head is always recognizable.
[1:31:36] <yukichocomilk> this is the coolest patches moment
[1:31:41] <Gorgs7> could always sell it to him in true Patches fashion @PeachSaliva
[1:31:44] <+Alopekis> I was gonna drop obvious hints but decided against it.
[1:31:52] <+whyskeywolfe> unfortunately ebrietas is confirmed not in game
[1:31:53] <%cade_calrayn> At least he didn't dropkick you like all the other times
[1:31:58] <+Taisuru> He wasn't in DS2 was he?
[1:32:01] <heartlesshealer> Murkwater Cave, if anyone missed map look
[1:32:04] <+3d_pbandj> He's not in DS2

[1:32:18] <%Agami23> theres a patchs in sekiro and armored core too
[1:32:23] <+Alopekis> Patches is the most recurring character of the Souls franchise.
[1:32:27] <+itsanonbunny> i did not know he wasn't in ds2
[1:32:30] <DancesWitBalrog> There was a Patches wannabe in DS2
[1:32:31] <+Alopekis> Patches is in Armored Core?
[1:32:32] <cartakus> and ds2 he is a split personality of two guys
[1:32:33] <Vaunno> armored core patches??

[1:32:38] <%cade_calrayn> Sekiro? Since when?
[1:32:38] <Zeemod155> Patchi-san
[1:32:38] <SpencerSDH> He is in Sekiro as "Anayama" which means "Patch"
[1:32:39] <$cooldude69xx> @3d_pbandj He is, he has a fued with a guy named Creighton
[1:32:39] <funnyfunnykid> They put this man in everything i think
[1:32:39] <+KyrlGrimblood> I must have missed him in DS2.
[1:32:39] <+Taisuru> Badger
[1:32:44] <%cade_calrayn> Ahhhhhh
[1:32:46] <+itsanonbunny> ohhh
[1:32:48] <ergulor> Fuck yeah Mushroom
[1:32:59] <%Agami23> his name in sekiro is "the patch of luck" i think. tries to bitch out half way through his fight.
[1:32:59] <Vaunno> but is patches in KINGS FIELD?!
[1:33:00] <Essixian> @3d_pbandj @cooldude69xx He's called Pate in DS2 though
[1:33:03] <%MooseIsGoose> do not steal from him again
[1:33:04] <%Agami23> or in armored core i mean
[1:33:05] <+Alopekis> Patches travels through the dimensions.
[1:33:13] <eduwardovich> I want to say patches is one of the Arena guys in Armored Core? I don't remember though.
[1:33:14] <+3d_pbandj> @3d_pbandj You mean Mild Mannered Pate?
[1:33:26] <+Taisuru> "You won't need a refund, and you also won't get one"
[1:33:31] <Vaunno> pate is patches? ehhhh
[1:33:45] <%zamatermort> Pate is NOT Patches
[1:33:45] <+Taisuru> Pate is not patches
[1:33:50] <+3d_pbandj> Pate's not Patches. he's voiced by a different guy too
[1:33:51] <xxHungryxx> Jack Black
[1:33:54] <Essixian> Pate is Patches in spirit
[1:33:56] <BigFingerRo> BO? YOU'RE the BO, rude?

[1:34:09] <Vaunno> yeah, thats stupid why would he be patches
[1:34:15] <+StevenTheUnicorn> : )
[1:34:20] <fuji_n2> Pate is Patches cause I say so :) Kappa
[1:34:26] <Parapattern> *Solid Snake Voice* "No! That is NOT Patches!"
[1:34:27] <+whyskeywolfe> Will Vanderpuye, a good Irish name

[1:34:49] <BigFingerRo> pickled in gold, that's a weird concept
[1:34:50] <%captain_thickthighs> Modern patches would sell an NFT straight up
[1:34:53] <Vaunno> 😳 😳
[1:34:57] <fuji_n2> don't kink shame him
[1:35:00] <%captain_thickthighs> kinky
[1:35:04] <fuji_n2> that's his fetish Kappa
[1:35:06] <sun312772> fetish means something else here
[1:35:11] <+Alopekis> No it doesn't
[1:35:11] <%cade_calrayn> You wanna kink-shame a boss, Paige?
[1:35:13] <+StevenTheUnicorn> big expensive fetish
[1:35:14] <SpencerSDH> Helps in the boss fight.
[1:35:15] <+Alopekis> It means the funny thing
[1:35:20] <Vaunno> @captain_thickthighs DAMMIT HE FUCKIN WOULD
[1:35:33] <+3d_pbandj> yea a lot of cultures have little statue things called 'fetish'
[1:35:34] <+StevenTheUnicorn> KINK SHAME A BOSS
[1:35:44] <%cade_calrayn> You should have some Rune items, I bet
[1:35:46] <SpencerSDH> But you're gonna solo all the bosses right ;)
[1:35:51] <%Dakuu75> feels worth it, just to see what it does in the fight
[1:35:53] <%captain_thickthighs> so Margaret is horney all the time literally and metaphorically
[1:35:57] <fuji_n2> pay 5k for a kink shame
[1:36:10] <Gorgs7> didn't you beat Margit already?
[1:36:15] <+Alopekis> No
[1:36:24] <xxHungryxx> Could always just farm the runes?
[1:36:28] <SpencerSDH> sell fruit
[1:36:31] <SpencerSDH> You have loads
[1:36:32] <%Bloomingzonda> @PeachSaliva Apparently Pathes voice actor announces MMA and Kickboxing matches in the UK
[1:36:35] <SpencerSDH> 1000 worth
[1:36:35] <Vaunno> "time for farming"
[1:36:35] <%captain_thickthighs> we need his safe word for stun lock
[1:36:36] <penitentpendant> Better to go explore and come back
[1:36:41] <+Alopekis> Sell your armor
[1:36:57] <Gorgs7> @PeachSaliva Sell Patches his armor back
[1:36:58] <xxHungryxx> The graveyards are also a place to find gold runes
[1:37:01] <penitentpendant> Leave it be for now
[1:37:03] <%Agami23> try it
[1:37:04] <+StevenTheUnicorn> he won't be mad
[1:37:10] <Vaunno> its fiiine
[1:37:11] <SpencerSDH> He won't be mad
[1:37:13] <+CalderGaming> paige? paige. when has patches ever been on the level
[1:37:15] <Vaunno> try it
[1:37:17] <+StevenTheUnicorn> he'll just laugh at u
[1:37:17] <%cade_calrayn> FYI, Paige, there's an entire zone south of the lake that you can explore before fighting Margit
[1:37:22] <+StevenTheUnicorn> farm good
[1:37:26] <Essixian> If you open that chest, Nothing Bad Will Happen.
[1:37:27] <Vaunno> :)
[1:37:32] <Aussie_Manny> tiffosDance
[1:37:39] <%CptCreampuff16> did she go to brb to farm runes?
[1:37:46] <+Alopekis> Nothing bad has ever come from opening a chest
[1:38:12] <Ell1ot> is farming runes a euphemism for going to the bathroom?
[1:38:30] <Vaunno> @ell1ot you implying it ISNT?
[1:38:35] <+Alopekis> If it is, then I need to go farm some runes.
[1:38:48] <+CalderGaming> who needs euphemisms when there are literally dung bombs in this game
[1:38:59] <+whyskeywolfe> Opening chests in Elden Ring is 100% good times in good places.
[1:39:02] <+Alopekis> There's a Loathsome Dung Eater too
[1:39:08] <%Dakuu75> ok, opening that chest was worth it
[1:39:08] <Aussie_Manny> tiffosThumbs
[1:39:27] <+whyskeywolfe> goddamn that was a quick pee
[1:39:35] <rommlll> 1 2 3 4

[1:39:46] <Vaunno> open amazing chest
[1:39:58] <rommlll> how far ahead is the paige
[1:39:58] <+StevenTheUnicorn> patches does have that effect on me
[1:39:59] <%cade_calrayn> @PeachSaliva everything south of the Lake is optional, and there's an entire zone the size of the one you've been exploring down there

[2:45:12] <downmagic> oh my god!
[2:45:13] <%StephanieSadGirl> @cyborgsamuraicowboyfanboy u aint wrong
[2:45:14] <Sigma_190_Beta> @PeachSaliva It's Gems/Jewels.
[2:45:18] <Aussie_Manny> Those must be fireflies. Fireflies that got stuck up in that big bluish black thing.
[2:45:19] <%FacetiousAF> 1 paige
[2:45:19] <%Puhff> yes dear
[2:45:20] <Spydurman> Hey
[2:45:26] <%FacetiousAF> nirnroot psaGib
[2:45:28] <ThatChainmecha> the night theme in this game sounds like the dark world theme from deltarune
[2:45:32] <%StephanieSadGirl> the sparkles in the ceiling are just the the butts of all the plants you have been picking
[2:45:33] <Spydurman> How goes Elden Ring?
[2:45:39] <hereiam407> Creepy yet beautiful
[2:45:40] <downmagic> Elden Ring is Under tail
[2:45:44] <+TungstenoViperante> Paige, you're the frist one to notice and i love it
[2:45:47] <+PrimalDweeb> This place is really big, you can use your horse here.
[2:45:56] <Aussie_Manny> Oh god, please not another key item needed. NotLikeThis
[2:45:56] <downmagic> so when SANS
[2:45:56] <rommlll> ride hors
[2:45:59] <%StephanieSadGirl> yes, use horse is important
[2:46:01] <ThatChainmecha> same
[2:46:05] <xxHungryxx> Smoke Herba
[2:46:06] <Aussie_Manny> Mind the water.
[2:46:07] <ThatChainmecha> i just unga bunga
[2:46:08] <penitentpendant> You need recipe books
[2:46:15] <Spydurman> I don't think I've seen anyone craft LUL
[2:46:17] <%zamatermort> Hit start, go to crafting
[2:46:20] <%StephanieSadGirl> the crafting system is actually quite simple, surprisingly so, you just need ot buy the crafting cook books
[2:46:21] <@SoFarFetched> geefBlind so dark
[2:46:21] <rudiciuscaesar> sneaking around constantly, what is this, Arkham Asylum
[2:46:21] <penitentpendant> Try to buy any that merchants have whenever you get a chance
[2:46:24] <+brightman42> it's handy, I can make all sorts of arrows now
[2:46:25] <+ReallyBigRocks> im 25 hours in and haven't crafted a single thing
[2:46:33] <%cade_calrayn> Don't forget your lamp, Paige
[2:46:38] <+PrimalDweeb> When booba is hurta, be sure to rub it with herba.
[2:46:48] <Hydrapissed> yah crafting seems to be just for ammo and bombs and curing items
[2:46:51] <Hydrapissed> its kinda eh
[2:46:53] <ThatChainmecha> haha
[2:46:55] <+ReallyBigRocks> not necessary if all you do is smack thing with big sword
[2:46:59] <%StephanieSadGirl> You can craft consumables.  I'v been using it alot because I'm using my bow alot and run out of arrows...
[2:47:04] <downmagic> friends
[2:47:05] <ThatChainmecha> dont bother them
[2:47:05] <+CalderGaming> crafting has made things way nicer to be a Bow/Crossbow User
[2:47:09] <$SirGO0SE> loving the stream setup btw paige <3
[2:47:24] <+brightman42> craft some throwing knives and lure them out maybe?
[2:47:25] <%StephanieSadGirl> @CalderGaming Right?!  That along side the LONG lock on range has made bwos and crossbows actually useful
[2:47:29] <Hydrapissed> food for buffs I guess
[2:47:29] <Ides42> yeah buying arrows is a money pit
[2:47:38] <$Fenlig> Does Paige know she keeps pressing down on the L3 and sneaking about?
[2:47:40] <ThatChainmecha> no, there another way to make a potion though
[2:47:48] <CryoByjorne> you can make arrow and damage pots
[2:47:48] <%cade_calrayn> You can make most of the items you'd normally buy - arrows, poison resistance items, firebombs, etc.
[2:47:49] <+brightman42> ya need recipe books for more stuff
[2:47:57] <downmagic> friends!
[2:48:04] <+PrimalDweeb> You can jump up there, just not from here.
[2:48:06] <ThatChainmecha> they wont bother you, unless you get close
[2:48:10] <ThatChainmecha> dont
[2:48:10] <%StephanieSadGirl> there are so many types of arrows.  My problem w/ crafting is that it requires you to go kill the friendly animals for resources...
[2:48:14] <cyborgsamuraicowboyfanboy> @stephaniesadgirl Yeah! That place was one the coolest things in Ds2.
[2:48:22] <kenny_biff> I just ran past all thesr guys lol
[2:48:27] <Aussie_Manny> ouchie

[2:48:30] <+heyitsbrian> backstabs are key
[2:48:30] <%StephanieSadGirl> @cyborgsamuraicowboyfanboy It was beautiful, too bad the enemies made it nearly unbearable
[2:48:31] <+brightman42> huh
[2:48:31] <+PrimalDweeb> Yeah, they hit super hard.
[2:48:39] <vilecrois> they're super slow though

[2:48:40] <%cade_calrayn> Yeah... so this place is high-level
[2:48:42] <xxHungryxx> Strong pointy sticks
[2:48:43] <%StephanieSadGirl> just walk past them, they are SLOW
[2:48:46] <%zamatermort> Oh Paige, you have found seeds, you can upgrade your flask

[2:49:01] <Ides42> can use horse to get past
[2:49:03] <+PrimalDweeb> This is a come back later place, but you can still explore and get a lot of stuff.

[2:58:47] <cyborgsamuraicowboyfanboy> @stephaniesadgirl Okay, I can cope with that. Cos I'm doing a new game + run of Ds3 right now, and the autotracking that takes place in almost EVERY SINGLE ENEMY ATTACK is one of the worst things about that game. It's so obnoxious 👿
[2:58:56] <ThatChainmecha> its the first day of spring break and im just drinking a gallon of milk
[2:58:56] <TychoRho> ironmouseWTF
[2:59:18] <%StephanieSadGirl> @cyborgsamuraicowboyfanboy It just makes trying to run through the area to explore and grab items extremly dangerous, vs a slow crawl killing everything
[2:59:24] <ThatChainmecha> enemy autotracking hasnt been that bad so far in this game
[2:59:33] <ThatChainmecha> except for spellcasting enemies
[2:59:35] <%StephanieSadGirl> no its real good in this game actually, so far

[3:01:22] <%StephanieSadGirl> I love that there are so many animal friends that arent hostile to you in this game, its real nice and is a real good chan ge of pace for souls games
[3:01:24] <Frostofthecwsw> there are multiple minors
[3:01:36] <+CalderGaming> a major number of minors
[3:01:42] <%StephanieSadGirl> @Frostofthecwsw and Spider-man isn't one of them, because hes 18
[3:01:44] <ThatChainmecha> im sorry i kill all wildlife i see in this game
[3:01:48] <ThatChainmecha> i need meat
[3:02:01] <Ides42> @StephanieSadGirl except if you want to be an archer you need to murder everyone you find
[3:02:16] <ThatChainmecha> i love how goblins in this game are literally just chimpanzees
[3:02:20] <%StephanieSadGirl> I do play an archer, I just grind and buy arrows from the nice shop guy on the coast
[3:02:35] <Ides42> fair
[3:02:52] <%StephanieSadGirl> its a complete loss, as far as cost to value, spend 4 arrows to kill something worth 25 souls, but still
[3:02:52] <+ChiuTheFat> So tank-y!

[3:04:13] <ThatChainmecha> oh yeah this should be fun
[3:04:17] <Aussie_Manny> AWOOOOOOOOOO
[3:04:41] <%cade_calrayn> Press Triangle/Y on one of the Gestures to Switch
[3:04:56] <cyborgsamuraicowboyfanboy> @thatchainmecha Good. U understand right? The most egregious example I can think of is at the beginning of castle lothric with those undead soldiers with the swords, when they continuously stagger forwards towards u and have this huuuuuge wind up which completely locks onto you no matter how far you run away from him. And then it just hits you.
[3:04:57] <ExpressNode> I think you push Y to switch them out on your menu
[3:04:58] <sirrice77> gestures are below the pouch so open up items, switch out with triangle
