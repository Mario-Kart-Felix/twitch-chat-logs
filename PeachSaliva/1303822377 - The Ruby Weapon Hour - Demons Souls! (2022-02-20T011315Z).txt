[0:10:29] <Latija> kegels

[0:10:36] <BigFingerRo> WOO
[0:10:37] <%KetsuoTaberu> you wear a diaper

[0:10:44] <CatRidder> stop peach
[0:10:47] <TheFrontRowJoe> tighten that up ? like with a wrench ?
[0:10:48] <%TerpanderLux> it shrinks
[0:10:49] <+ReallyBigRocks> it's a muscle that's meant to stretch
[0:10:50] <arkv01> prolapse
[0:10:50] <TurtlesAndTentacles> you can always tighten up
[0:10:51] <Danitaras> they call you the whistler
[0:10:54] <%TerpanderLux> it shrinks and disappears
[0:10:57] <$kawajenarts> ask the real questions
[0:11:02] <Coystick> Zangief hates it
[0:11:05] <%CzeekyTV> kegels?
[0:11:07] <+barrakuta371> I dunno, but I know you should get a colonoscopy regularly
[0:11:08] <%TerpanderLux> yes
[0:11:10] <%KetsuoTaberu> a face lift for buttholes
[0:11:11] <Ombrebird> technically yes
[0:11:13] <%Sotetsu> It depends on if you try to crush the penis, or just go with it.
[0:11:14] <Dr_Mooose> if its a muscle you can work it
[0:11:18] <%TerpanderLux> assceps
[0:11:19] <+ReallyBigRocks> I guess if you had like a weighted butt plug or something
[0:11:19] <+Piemen99> LIFT?!
[0:11:20] <ToneBacas> it's a muscle so it can contract I assume
[0:11:24] <$NitronStreams> buttceps
[0:11:26] <shanna_become_gamer> Do you even lift.
[0:11:26] <%perspectivphilosophr> as an ICU nurse is called loss of anal tone

[0:11:32] <%ChrisPlaysThing> Bounce up and down on a trampoline, build up theat P muscle
[0:11:34] <biglomix> Depends
[0:11:35] <Delenay> never trust a fart
[0:11:36] <+Ne1son> You ass just prolapses thats how it goes
[0:11:37] <%TerpanderLux> then you will lose the bet
[0:11:38] <%VideoGoblin> At 70, every fart is a risk
[0:11:38] <+Pleblu> Never trust a 70s fart
[0:11:41] <linSP> just wear a diaper starting now
[0:11:44] <$kawajenarts> it's not like you're overstretching a rubber band Paige
[0:11:47] <Dapper_Cactuar> dafuq kind of conversation did I join to
[0:11:48] <SlagChambers> The energy of this conversation reminds me of the "fake male orgasm" talk
[0:11:49] <ToneBacas> LUL
[0:11:49] <%Sotetsu> I make anal tones when I fart
[0:11:49] <arkv01> I don't even trust my farts now
[0:11:49] <+tempestzephyr> it all just falls out
[0:11:54] <+Piemen99> @PeachSaliva you're always rolling that fart dice
[0:11:56] <Coystick> noooo
[0:11:59] <%ChrisPlaysThing> Paige has lost most of her anal tone Kappa
[0:12:00] <%Bluwizard21> @PeachSaliva An average sphincter can stretch to allow a adult raccon in
[0:12:08] <%Sotetsu> Let's all learn about Paige's anal tone. fmgJAHN
[0:12:10] <+realm_forge> Everybody’s gambled on a fart and lost it doesn’t matter how old you are
[0:12:13] <+ReallyBigRocks> anal tone is a good euphemism for farts
[0:12:13] <hearingthenseeing> incoming butt lore
[0:12:16] <%TerpanderLux> monkaS tone
[0:12:21] <%KetsuoTaberu> LUL

[0:12:54] <TheFrontRowJoe> MonkaW
[0:12:55] <+McSoliace> pat almost got revenge
[0:12:58] <+Pleblu> Do they use tuning forks to check the tones?
[0:13:03] <Latija> i'm going to canada now
[0:13:04] <marvel877> NO BUTT STUFF
[0:13:05] <%KetsuoTaberu> She almost got away with it too
[0:13:06] <@SoFarFetched> geefSmugAF
[0:13:06] <%TerpanderLux> :)
[0:13:07] <%ElMaestroChoque> mm i think it is a E#
[0:13:08] <BigFingerRo> Now THIS is a convo to walk into first thing in the stream
[0:13:11] <blackened61986> So wait. You DIDN'T want the hot French chick inside you?

[0:13:14] <Dr_Mooose> some people pay extra for that
[0:13:15] <BigFingerRo> AH POOP FROM THERE
[0:13:15] <%ChrisPlaysThing> *shrugs*
[0:13:15] <@MelBrooksKA> If your butt isn't at least a High C, you gotta get that shit fixed
[0:13:21] <arkv01> hon hon hon
[0:13:23] <%TerpanderLux> haha. hohn hohn.
[0:13:24] <%Sotetsu> Hoh hoh
[0:13:28] <+Pleblu> Just slap the but rim with the tuning fork
[0:13:30] <%Lion_kun> Shut up and spread those cheeks, Paige. God you Americans are so shy.
[0:13:32] <linSP> why wouldn’t you take the offer for a free butt job
[0:13:34] <%TerpanderLux> same.
[0:13:37] <shieldecho> ...I have pee anxiety, sometimes it takes me a full minute. I feel like a few seconds is fine.
[0:13:38] <Latija> LOL
[0:13:39] <%JoshManVGH> I mean, in USA, getting fingered is the CHEAPER option!
[0:13:39] <%Sotetsu> Just think of something sweet.
[0:13:42] <TurtlesAndTentacles> HON HON GIVE ME YOUR BUTT HOLE
[0:13:43] <+Ne1son> I volunteer
[0:13:44] <Ombrebird> did the nurse offer to be naked with you in solidarity?
[0:13:47] <BigFingerRo> That's for pat only
[0:13:49] <peachy996> tickle tickle
[0:13:50] <Danitaras> Paige is pure, she won't allow it
[0:13:51] <%TheYellowcouch> opportunity missed
[0:13:54] <+realm_forge> WHAT PLANET ARE YOU FROM PAIGE
[0:13:55] <%TerpanderLux> she loves it
[0:13:56] <%ChrisPlaysThing> She'll check the tone by humming into your ass
[0:14:00] <tanarath> she liked your butt
[0:14:03] <marrowjuice> i just dropped in, what the actual fuck are you guys talking about???
[0:14:04] <%Vextalyst> Paige's fear: what if I enjoy this?
[0:14:05] <%ChrisPlaysThing> and try matching the tone Kappa
[0:14:06] <%Sotetsu> Get sphincter injections to help with tone.
[0:14:08] <Latija> WHY NOT
[0:14:08] <%JoshManVGH> A CT scan can run $3000USD here.
[0:14:08] <arkv01> you really should've accepted her offer :)
[0:14:10] <SilverFaustX> why not
[0:14:13] <%TheYellowcouch> yes
[0:14:15] <linSP> BUT YOU NEED IT TO LIVE
[0:14:15] <%Lion_kun> It's a medical procedure, paige.
[0:14:15] <Dr_Mooose> very true
[0:14:15] <%TerpanderLux> not me :)
[0:14:16] <+MidnightBurst12> true
[0:14:16] <%W1nterTitan> True
[0:14:17] <TurtlesAndTentacles> But if it's life or death you really should
[0:14:18] <hearingthenseeing> she wasn't asking
[0:14:18] <KodoqueG> and?
[0:14:19] <%Ranryu692> it's probably significantly cheaper for her to use her finger than the CT scan
[0:14:20] <Coystick> And then she pulled out the rubber glove
[0:14:20] <%ChrisPlaysThing> FUCK YEAH
[0:14:21] <@MelBrooksKA> Paige is also a freak
[0:14:21] <%Lion_kun> It was a necessity!
[0:14:21] <+Pleblu> Do you want ugly ladies doing it?
[0:14:21] <peachy996> yeah?
[0:14:22] <Foopoof> anal? no anal
[0:14:22] <BigFingerRo> THIS IS FOR MEDICINE
[0:14:23] <biglomix> so you did an expensive scan instead
[0:14:24] <DrFaustMD> I-It's not like I want you to put it in my butt b-baka
[0:14:24] <%Sotetsu> Pat, you're in the chat, too.
[0:14:26] <%DoomUnderTheStairs> all kinky freaks
[0:14:28] <alroy909> that was a missed opportunity paige
[0:14:29] <SleepyTimeTonberry> pwnsBonk1 pwnsBonk2
[0:14:31] <stealthfart> It was a medical procedure. It’s all proper
[0:14:31] <+realm_forge> WE SURE ARE PAT
[0:14:32] <%Lion_kun> Because in canada, healthcare isn't a scam.
[0:14:32] <$NitronStreams> Icm not a freak I'm a weirdo
[0:14:33] <%ElMaestroChoque> medical butt toning
[0:14:34] <%JoshManVGH> That's awesome!
[0:14:34] <@MelBrooksKA> YOU WANT TO FUCK A SKELETON
[0:14:35] <+McSoliace> we're freaks in pat's chat too
[0:14:40] <%KetsuoTaberu> What's the cost of the fingers-in-butthole vs a CT scan?
[0:14:44] <%DoomUnderTheStairs> well now we know Paige don't like the butt stuff
[0:14:46] <NoHoldsBarredProductions> She just wanted more content for her OnlyFans, Paige.
[0:14:48] <+HelveticaScenario> Tell Pat to shut up. I am NOT a freak. I'm a degenerate.
[0:14:55] <%TheYellowcouch> time to go to Canada I guess

[0:15:55] <$rdark_ksu> Aint it the same muscles used for the pee and the poo? I'd assume thats the reason. Not that the hot French Dr had a butthole fascination
[0:15:55] <+CalderGaming> @biglomix i mean with paige's luck maybe they WERE
[0:15:58] <+Mantorok06> psaDogchamp

[0:16:31] <%Dakuu75> asking the real questions
[0:16:32] <Void_The_Dark> ITS FISTING OR DEATH, PAIGE
[0:16:33] <DracaenaLeaf> it makes sense, don't you hide it from Pat?
[0:16:34] <%Brassnarwhal> she has to check if your prostate is swollen paige

[0:16:46] <%JoshManVGH> What if it's the only way to
[0:16:48] <blackened61986> Two is too many for Paige.
[0:16:49] <+dawsfloss> maybe 3 idk

[0:17:04] <arkv01> @Bearphonics paige you will need to get a colonoscopy at some point in your life
[0:17:05] <rcand9> 2 is basically nothing
[0:17:05] <%Lion_kun> Are you saying Pat's dick is smaller than 2 fingers?
[0:17:05] <+Pleblu> Paige its ok if its a one knuckler
[0:17:05] <%TheYellowcouch> coward
[0:17:06] <%Dakuu75> you're a pro at 2 fingers
[0:17:09] <TurtlesAndTentacles> its always 2 Paige.

[0:17:17] <LoneFonte> i just got here what tHE FUCK
[0:17:17] <Ombrebird> its 3 or the first paige
[0:17:18] <%Ranryu692> You've definitely taken a poop thicker than 2 fingers
[0:17:19] <%perspectivphilosophr> the reason they check the anal tone in the rectum is because it can let you know if there is spinal nerve issues.  which would affect the urethra. it's weird but there is science behind it.
[0:17:19] <+Logoth_> Gordon ramsay uses 3 fingers
[0:17:20] <+Pleblu> Two knuckler is too much
[0:17:20] <+MidnightBurst12> wtf is this conversation even?

[0:17:51] <TurtlesAndTentacles> You realize men have to get colon exams, especially men of color. 2 fingers mean nothing lol

[0:18:51] <tinytinykittycat> partin it like Moses
[0:18:51] <%JoshManVGH> Also, is it the nurse that typically does that sort of procedure?
[0:18:51] <MetalSlimeHunt> For the record, anal tone is a legitimate medical diagnostic. But also hilarious.
[0:18:51] <stolando> this is called anal vore i think
[0:18:52] <%vivaldiva> oh man we're taking Vore to a whole new level
[0:18:52] <TheFrontRowJoe> OK DUD
[0:18:52] <KodoqueG> "there's a clog further up the pipe"
[0:18:53] <+Sir_Louis> Is an anal tone what you get when you butt dial someone?
[0:18:54] <+ReallyBigRocks> a medical marvel
[0:18:57] <Treasure_Vault> Footing

[0:21:02] <SiriusLeeLost> Gonna be awkward for Paige when Eldin Ring ask you to join the Two Finger club :v
[0:21:05] <+Jack8274> Is that why she was indignant? No one has ever said no before?

[0:21:28] <+Piemen99> "But Reddit said this would work"
[0:21:29] <cs0402196> french lady suprised that her pegging streak on white males ends with white females

[0:28:36] <+Piemen99> I remember that one time pat talked about that one horse girl that got decapitated
[0:28:38] <DianaTheAscian> thats the same for a lot of people
[0:28:39] <teefpal> Are we still talking about butt stuff
[0:28:43] <%Brassnarwhal> that's so rude to say even if it's true lol
[0:28:49] <APsaull> TBH my first notion of what you guys looked like was from old old Plague of Gripes animations.

[0:29:16] <Ombrebird> @piemen99 source for the horse decapitation?
[0:29:19] <%FaultyJawa> reminds me of a friend (person of color) who had a guy at a store tell her, "you're really pretty for being so dark"

[0:30:26] <GhostlySkunk> Filter life
[0:30:28] <teefpal> Oh no you look normal
[0:30:31] <+Mekhet09> That's because of photoshop.
[0:30:34] <Broand> I don't look good either way!
[0:30:34] <%perspectivphilosophr> or they use photo retouching
[0:30:37] <+Mekhet09> And angles.
[0:30:39] <Reti_the_gator> like pat
[0:30:41] <absolute_cagemony> Does Paige ever dress up as Lady Damestricue and chase Pat around the house?
[0:30:46] <+ReallyBigRocks> It's because most people have crazy filters on their photos, basically CG face replacement
[0:30:54] <+Psycho_Kowalski> Canadian woman insists most people are hideous

[0:39:20] <teefpal> Gods salty

[0:39:36] <rasamune> Because fuck em
[0:39:36] <+realm_forge> Most of the biblical cities were ass to be honest
[0:39:37] <%SlagChambers> probably just chosen based off of the location the storytellers were in
[0:39:38] <teefpal> There is an actual thematic reason but I dont remember
[0:39:38] <Ombrebird> gods salty butthole
[0:39:38] <Burdenslo> cause God is an arsehole
[0:39:39] <Broand> Was it Kosher salt?
[0:39:40] <+TheUltrahumanoid> God was flashing  his salty butthole
[0:39:42] <%RetroCop87> God was like "I need some salt for these fries, and these fools will DEFINITELY turn to salt..."
[0:39:43] <%rumtumtugnutz> Salt was evil
[0:39:43] <+NWR_James> There are salt pillars in the area

[0:39:46] <+yungkame> the vibes were just off
[0:39:50] <%TerpanderLux> you werent there.
[0:39:51] <+CalderGaming> someone probably saw a large salt deposit that looked kind of like a person and wrote a morality tale to explain it

[1:12:18] <+Mekhet09> Just make it a lets play.
[1:12:19] <worldbrand> that would be neat because it would give people who want to play it for themselves a chance to catch up too
[1:12:21] <%Th3SmartAlec> no plan, only subathon
[1:12:22] <+UltraViolet371> wait but then how will you grind a little off-stream is paige is streaming

[1:12:32] <+Felhad> you all know subathons allow for sleeping yes?
[1:12:33] <+barrakuta371> depends, a plan helps
[1:12:34] <+ReallyBigRocks> planning to not do anything else
[1:12:36] <ELkasle> figure out as you go
[1:12:36] <%TheYellowcouch> nah I'm sure you can just wing a forever stream
[1:12:37] <tanarath> Plan
[1:12:38] <Coystick> I wasn't able to get the day off so I'm going to commit petty crimes at work as retribution
[1:12:38] <Foopoof> planning is for poosies, just do
[1:12:41] <+Arizon1317> At least two cases of redbull
[1:12:44] <%Sotetsu> 4 days is plenty of time

[1:13:00] <%Th3SmartAlec> That's even BETTER though
[1:13:01] <%DianaTheAscian> THATS EVEN BATTER
[1:13:03] <DashXero> That wouldn't happen, Pat.
[1:13:04] <Treasure_Vault> That'd be hilarious though
[1:13:05] <critiquequartz> I think you’d need to announce it at least and build it up
[1:13:06] <+cvp5127> thats the best part
[1:13:07] <Spydurman> like it goes for 2 hours?
[1:13:09] <huskarl_zap> YouTube Warhammer videos subathon siege of vraks took four days
[1:13:09] <MyNameIsRasus> 1 sub = 1 hour
[1:13:14] <$cgreene64> "sunbathing, ended early."😔😔😔😔😔
[1:13:14] <Vaunno> 1 sub = 0.025s
[1:13:15] <DashXero> You could get the big subs.
[1:13:20] <critiquequartz> I doubt it would
[1:13:23] <Sigma_190_Beta> 1 Sub for three minutes.
[1:13:25] <%Sotetsu> 1 sub = 10 minutes
[1:13:25] <linSP> one sub = 1 day
[1:13:25] <+vehementvadr> 5 minutes is a bit much
[1:13:26] <BigFingerRo> 15 mins per sub
[1:13:27] <+Toast_Master_General> Pat no matter if it's a success or not it will defiantly still be pathetic
[1:13:27] <ELkasle> 1 sub 10m
[1:13:28] <Bit_Byter> You're selling yourself short
[1:13:30] <Spydurman> nyannSadge
[1:13:31] <+bytex678> 1 sub 30 minutes
[1:13:32] <%TheYellowcouch> no
[1:13:33] <Spydurman> ya
[1:13:33] <BigYanno> 1 sub = 10 minutes
[1:13:34] <Dr_Mooose> 5 mins is a lot
[1:13:34] <%FacetiousAF> 1 sub =  1 soul level Kappa
[1:13:36] <+SWFanatic> Maybe just shoot for quality rather than quantity
[1:13:36] <+NWR_James> 1 sub 20 days
[1:13:36] <+Saggitori> You're short
[1:13:37] <CatRidder> 3 minutes 1 sub
[1:13:40] <+SWFanatic> every sub you be more funny
[1:13:41] <critiquequartz> 1 sub is 2 minutes
[1:13:43] <+MidnightBurst12> 1 sum = 1 hour
[1:13:46] <MyNameIsRasus> 2 minutes
[1:13:46] <Spydurman> what if the subathon is like 1 hour
[1:13:48] <Pookiedaexzile> Total Failure Big Mistake
[1:13:48] <Bit_Byter> fair enough lol
[1:13:48] <+yungkame> 1 sub = 5 hours
[1:13:49] <%Sotetsu> I totally get it.
[1:13:52] <Vaunno> he's selling appropriate to his height
[1:13:52] <twistedj3ster> I'm afraid we'll sub too much and get sick of you before we run out of sub
[1:13:52] <Treasure_Vault> And then it's way too big, yeah
[1:13:53] <+cherrycottontail> try it then, loser
[1:13:53] <%TheYellowcouch> start big and get smaller
[1:13:54] <cartakus> Nah
[1:13:55] <+OrangeMDT> 1 sub = 1 stream
[1:13:56] <$SirGO0SE> 1 sub = show feet? 😳
[1:13:57] <+Toast_Master_General> Ah yes the first time
[1:13:57] <%DianaTheAscian> You've had some crazy donnos in the past
[1:13:57] <GamesNoir> HAHAHAHAHAHA
[1:13:59] <worldbrand> there's probably a formula for it based on your analytics
[1:13:59] <%Th3SmartAlec> well then... I guess we'll all see your big/small penis then
[1:14:00] <+TheMeromex> thats sights
[1:14:02] <+bytex678> and your subathon will end after 1 hour
[1:14:03] <%realm_forge> realm_forge subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 5 months! Just got Father G to werewolf form I see what you mean now 😝
[1:14:03] <AlaridKonz> you could test the first hour, and adjust from there
[1:14:04] <Spydurman> you just delete the VOD and all evidence the subathon ever happened
[1:14:05] <MyNameIsRasus> hit the back of the subathon
[1:14:06] <aeravon> so true
[1:14:08] <%VashyronM> I don't think that's how it works
[1:14:15] <Cynical2DD> Those arrows seems really slow
[1:14:16] <%Bluwizard21> @PeachSaliva Pat, you had 1.4k viewers yesterday. Elden Ring is the biggest shit of the year. You will probably do just fine
[1:14:16] <Pookiedaexzile> 5 inches Confirmed
[1:14:18] <%MegadBlitz> "oh no i-i-is it too big? I'm sowwy"
[1:14:19] <critiquequartz> If you hit 10,000 subs you have to play banjo kazooie on stream
[1:14:23] <MyNameIsRasus> it's pat
[1:14:30] <Mattais88> 1 sub+ 1 minute of rug on screen
[1:14:33] <Vaunno> its dat boi
[1:14:35] <BigFingerRo> FITE HIM
[1:14:37] <huskarl_zap> vanguard also got whiteface
[1:14:46] <MyNameIsRasus> every 1 hour of subs we get a minute of rug time
[1:14:47] <BigFingerRo> FORSOOTH IT'S THAT MAN

[1:15:07] <%VashyronM> But what if Elden Ring is bad though
[1:15:08] <+Saggitori> it would be kinda funny
[1:15:09] <Cynical2DD> Why not a CSB Subathon
[1:15:10] <Latija> just stream like a normal person
[1:15:10] <Hydrapissed> pat ima mortgage my house if u do it

[1:15:15] <my2k_> I'VE WAITED AGES FOR YOU GUYS TO PLAY ELDEN RING, A SUBATHON IS A GREAT IDEA PLS
[1:15:22] <+CalderGaming> what if elden ring BREAKS
[1:15:23] <teefpal> People will absolutely say its bad
[1:15:24] <+twohitgood> can't be any worse than DS2.
[1:15:24] <Bit_Byter> make me sub again daddies
[1:15:25] <%rekinom> A reverse subathon where each sub removes 5 minutes from how long you're going to be streaming
[1:15:26] <+ALazo> yeah but what if tho
[1:15:27] <Pookiedaexzile> Pat Played it
[1:15:27] <tanarath> Pat, we'd make you dance, it'll be fine
[1:15:27] <MyNameIsRasus> It has powerstancing, it's good by default
[1:15:28] <%TheYellowcouch> how even could it be bad
[1:15:32] <+Kemmybelle> What about 1 sub = however long you choose up to a stream of 12 hours? At least for the first time to see how it goes.
[1:15:32] <Coystick> Plague is going to LOVE Elden Ring
[1:15:32] <+cherrycottontail> do it pat, do the subathon
[1:15:34] <huskarl_zap> lol
[1:15:42] <+vehementvadr> pat will gift 100 subs if elden ring is bad
[1:15:44] <+TheMeromex> it be embarrassing for 1 of you if the other gets more subs on the subaton
[1:15:46] <critiquequartz> Don’t you guys have friends that stream? Can’t you ask them for advice ?

[1:15:54] <Octopimp> hey the best souls
[1:15:54] <%DoomUnderTheStairs> If you guys do a subathon I will definitely be down to watch and play elden ring myself at the same time!
[1:15:54] <cartakus> You have a build pat?
[1:15:55] <%Dakuu75> I think the only "planning" you need is, make sure your health is on point that day. (good night rest, take your meds) then make sure you have enough mods
[1:15:55] <+ReallyBigRocks> god could you imagine if it's just complete fucking garbage?
[1:15:56] <$SirGO0SE> a surprise to no one
[1:15:57] <eduwardovich> It could conceivably be one of those where it shits itself in the last act.
[1:15:58] <%DoomUnderTheStairs> yeahhhhh
[1:16:00] <+ClericOfSparda> Elden Ring will not be bad. It's Dark Souls with Horses
[1:16:01] <+yungkame> ok but what about a reverse subathon? 48 hours and each sub takes 5 seconds off
[1:16:03] <$cooldude69xx> Eli hates games that need reactions
[1:16:04] <Coystick> He loves it so much, it's going to be his favourite
[1:16:05] <%g0atmeal> he hates everything
[1:16:05] <+notsoy> what if? it's a souls game, of course it's going to be buggy

[1:16:22] <+patriotrenegade> @linSP you shut the hell up
[1:16:25] <teefpal> @eduwardovich Those are the worst, especially if the rest of the game is good
[1:16:29] <%zamatermort> Eli hates good thing
[1:16:30] <%Sotetsu> Plague shuns the good in Man.

[1:54:25] <MetalSlimeHunt> Local woman criticizes Pat over talking about pure madness after two hours of talking about pure madness
[1:54:26] <+UltraViolet371> are these spite parries, what the hell
[1:54:26] <BroSage> hello mustard soveriegn, and the one who must be pondered. Do you believe Elden Ring will be a single game, or are we gearing up for another trilogy?

[1:55:15] <zzNamttamzz> elder ring, eldest ring
[1:55:24] <MetalSlimeHunt> I think From has pretty clearly shown with Sekiro and Bloodborne that they want to move to standalones
[1:55:25] <%rumtumtugnutz> elden ring is gonna be a standalone
[1:55:26] <%Dakuu75> I think is should be Elden Ring then in a few months Bloodborne remaster will be anounced.
[1:55:41] <%TerpanderLux> elden rim
[1:55:42] <ExpressNode> Probably expansions at least but no sequels for sure

[1:56:21] <DashXero> Sekiro: great Souls game, terrible Tenchu game.
[1:56:23] <+CalderGaming> someday there will be a new armored core and no one will like it because it won't be souls enough
[1:56:23] <DancesWitBalrog> Sekiro is a Tenchu game to me, not a Souls
[1:56:25] <$Puhff> It's also hard af
[1:56:30] <Coystick> From makes Souls games, everyone else makes Soulslikes, I've been saying that from the start, it's so easy and Soulsborne sounds so stupid.
[1:56:34] <%DianaTheAscian> the only thing it shares with the other is that fromsoft made it

[2:17:42] <Ape_Law> "you know how you were doing it shitty, and bad before? Just do it good!"
[2:17:44] <Treasure_Vault> He sent a letter to a lady saying "Oh my god I am retarded"
[2:17:47] <MetalSlimeHunt> The first time Lovecraft went to New York he had a mental breakdown
[2:17:51] <$cooldude69xx> He talked about how he regretted it
[2:17:52] <zenith0111> Tbf at the time he came out in that fairly progressive lol
[2:17:52] <+UltraViolet371> Yeah he said he regretted a lot of his views later
[2:17:53] <TheHeroAppears> the in prase
[2:17:55] <Ozavic> He improved, still racist
[2:17:59] <%TheYellowcouch> he apologized on twitter
[2:18:02] <TheHeroAppears> the in praise of shadows vid on him is great
[2:18:05] <+Shoosler> more like HATEcraft
[2:18:07] <+patriotrenegade> Italians till terrified him.
[2:18:09] <+swesterly> lovecraft is irrelevant, just read laird barron
[2:18:09] <@PlagueOfGripes> he was improving because of his exposure to the people he was raised to hate
[2:18:15] <TheEndlessRiver1> lovecraft was horribly isolated, so actually getting exposed did help, but still racist
[2:18:23] <+Ne1son> Xenophobic heavy on the Phobic
[2:18:25] <$rdark_ksu> Wasn’t he raised in like very very isolated with his super wack ass mom?
[2:18:25] <@MistyMntns> OH BOY do we like talking about Lovecraft
[2:18:25] <$Xevtes> @Shoosler psaDabb
[2:18:26] <AvroEltz> Not just the racism, wasn't he super paranoid?
[2:18:28] <zenith0111> LMAOOOO
[2:18:31] <%wolfofsound> @PlagueOfGripes like most southern people who meet minorities
[2:18:32] <Ape_Law> the dude who wrote tarzan was just "holy hell lovecraft"
[2:18:32] <+RandyFistburgers> His book I have legit has a "this dude was a big racist" disclaimer in it
[2:18:33] <+TopTieramisu> yeah, his mom sounded very wack
[2:18:36] <@MelBrooksKA> Wasn't his wife Jewish or something too?
[2:18:44] <TurtlesAndTentacles> yeah just 3/5 th of a human. this is why Loe
[2:18:44] <%DyslexicWizrad> he named his cat the N-word but his stories are amazing
[2:18:44] <+TopTieramisu> and his dad named the cat, too i think?
[2:18:45] <%AncelDeLambert> "Lovecraft, dude, you've got to stop having an existential crisis over having a Polish ancestor, man, this is embarrasing."
[2:18:50] <%g0atmeal> you have to escape horny jail
[2:18:50] <%Th3SmartAlec> what a twist!
[2:18:52] <%wolfofsound> @MelBrooksKA he loved her "despite" that
[2:18:53] <scrumbotime> killed an innocent man
[2:18:55] <TurtlesAndTentacles> this is why Lovecraft country is great
[2:18:57] <%Agami23> he wrote about how much he hated everyone too. like welsh and alaskans and stuff. which is really funny since he was part welsh
[2:19:01] <+Arizon1317> The KKK asked him to stop associating with them
[2:19:02] <$cooldude69xx> @AncelDeLambert Welsh actually
[2:19:06] <%shi013> he got racist because he moved to new york
[2:19:06] <+patriotrenegade> THE MIXUP
[2:19:09] <%Sotetsu> What time does Elden Ring come out on Thursday?
[2:19:14] <MetalSlimeHunt> She was, though they did end up divorcing. She said he was a passable husband.
[2:19:15] <+Arizon1317> look it up
[2:19:15] <+TopTieramisu> that's bs
[2:19:17] <hasansviewcountbot> KKK took my baby away
[2:19:17] <%AncelDeLambert> @AncelDeLambert I knew it was something unusual
[2:19:19] <zenith0111> OH NO
[2:19:20] <@PlagueOfGripes> another perfect paige play
[2:19:21] <+godzookylives> @PeachSaliva Robert Howard the creator of Conan was a pen pal of Lovecraft and told him in letters to tone down the racism
[2:19:22] <+TopTieramisu> no way...
[2:19:22] <+Ne1son> Source
[2:19:24] <zenith0111> THATS SO CRINGE
[2:19:27] <%wolfofsound> @PeachSaliva this is a closed cross burning my guy
[2:19:28] <churropoppa> he hated poor white people too cause they weren't "pure" LUL
[2:19:28] <DashXero> Wait. That's possible?
[2:19:28] <%AncelDeLambert> man, Twitch's thread feature suuuuuucks
[2:19:29] <%bevyrage> that's fake
[2:19:30] <%Dakuu75> he couldn't of been THAT high level. wow.
[2:19:32] <%g0atmeal> i would be so humiliated if the kkk didn't associate with me
[2:19:33] <jetpack_rorschasch> I hope it's real.
[2:19:38] <$rdark_ksu> So his Jewish wife fucked some sanity into him?
[2:19:42] <Chaos_Aether> it will
[2:19:44] <$Puhff> A man from 100 years ago was racist, i am shocked
[2:19:44] <thebestesttrashpanda> Truly the eldritch god of racism
[2:19:47] <Coystick> Hitler was like "bruh"
[2:19:49] <+TopTieramisu> but everyone tells the truth online
[2:19:51] <@MistyMntns> Speaking of Lovecraft I saw his notes and drawings when I was in Providence.
[2:19:51] <linSP> does the hp is the racism
[2:19:53] <DancesWitBalrog> FBI now spying on Pat's phone
[2:19:54] <vulpuspictus> I like how Lovecraft was so dumb he was scared of curved geometry
[2:19:54] <%Th3SmartAlec> just put in "Jojo Part 6", it'll balance out
[2:19:55] <@PlagueOfGripes> fox news recommendations incoming for pat
[2:19:55] <%realm_forge> I heard he had a mental breakdown over finding out he had Welsh ancestors
[2:19:56] <%shi013> none of what pat said is true
[2:19:58] <%DyslexicWizrad> Pat's om a no flight list now. GG
[2:20:01] <thebestesttrashpanda> or maybe the elder truth is racism
[2:20:01] <TurtlesAndTentacles> Do it for Stranger Things Paige
[2:20:04] <MetalSlimeHunt> The center of Lovecraft's issues appears to have been wild paranoia, which seeped into everything else including the racism
[2:20:05] <Fien111> HP did fucking HATE the nazis though
[2:20:05] <%greasypete00> I remember hearing somewhere that the kk k was originally formed as kind of a shitpost?
[2:20:06] <Ape_Law> he was double secret ultra racist
[2:20:06] <+Ne1son> People love making shit up about HP like there isnt enough stuff already there
[2:20:07] <%TerpanderLux> D:
[2:20:13] <%Agami23> wait, does paiges sword do a DoT?
[2:20:18] <%wolfofsound> @PlagueOfGripes can eating shit cure covid"
[2:20:22] <+swesterly> again cosmic horror has come a long way and has far surpassed lovecraft
[2:20:23] <jetpack_rorschasch> Lies are more fun though!
[2:20:24] <+Ophill> Wakka even thought lovcraft was a bit much
[2:20:26] <@commanderclaw> And then he died of colon cancer at age 30
[2:20:27] <%Agami23> huh
[2:20:29] <churropoppa> It's all literally true that chatter just doesn't know anything
[2:20:35] <@MelBrooksKA> Also he did not name his cat that
[2:20:40] <$Puhff> Who cares??? HE'S DEAD
[2:20:41] <@MelBrooksKA> That was his dad
[2:20:47] <%TerpanderLux> the bad men
[2:20:48] <zenith0111> HP Lovecraft was also cheating on his wife with a college fanboy
[2:20:48] <$Puhff> Like wtf lol
[2:20:49] <@PlagueOfGripes> DoTs don't work so great in games where the enemies die in like 2-3 hits
[2:20:51] <%g0atmeal> PogChamp
[2:20:53] <%tentavision> NO THE MIND FLAYER
[2:20:54] <+Shoosler> he can STAY dead for all I care!
[2:20:54] <AvroEltz> Everything is a lie, Lovecraft didn't exist, he was always a lie
[2:21:00] <+TopTieramisu> the cat was used to the name
[2:21:01] <MetalSlimeHunt> Ok sure, but he did write all those letters, that was definitely him
[2:21:02] <%wolfofsound> I think not renaming was a mark
[2:21:03] <+godzookylives> Lovecraft was big into colonialism and thought that it was white people's duty to "civilize" the world
[2:21:04] <Mattais88> Because it was like 13, like?
[2:21:09] <$Sirtimbob> Why attend church when I can listen to Paiges stream? Jesus, Mary, Joseph
[2:21:12] <%asthanius> That makes it worse
[2:21:21] <%DianaTheAscian> he would say his wife was "one of the good ones"
[2:21:21] <@PlagueOfGripes> chairman meow
[2:21:24] <Treasure_Vault> Imagine he tried to rename it and the cat wouldn't respond to anything else
[2:21:26] <%Agami23> i wonder how much lovecraft lost it when he learned he was part welsh since he wrote so many stories about the welsh as fish people
[2:21:27] <%ElkRiverDog> Apparently the kkk and Lovecraft never talked, but they probably wouldn't have like his work because they think that they are a Christian organization
[2:21:33] <twistedj3ster> He named a character's cat that in one of his stories
[2:21:41] <DancesWitBalrog> @dianatheascian what. the fuck.
[2:21:46] <%TheYellowcouch> do you think he would also call his cat grandpa
[2:21:55] <+TopTieramisu> @Agami23 the shadow over innsmouth was written as a response to him finding out his heritage
[2:21:56] <MetalSlimeHunt> Shadow over Innsmouth was written in a haze of panic over Lovecraft's discovery that one of his grandparents was Welsh and not English
[2:22:09] <+OneTrueAsshat> I've done this level countless times and still get lost
[2:22:26] <%wolfofsound> Oh the horror
[2:22:26] <%TerpanderLux> OH NOOOOO
[2:22:28] <@MistyMntns> I gotta say, Shadow over Insmouth is my favorite stories.
[2:22:30] <scrumbotime> THE WELSH ARE FISH PEOPLE?
[2:22:32] <+swesterly> @Puhff i mean his work isn't idiot
[2:22:34] <Feldum14> Eww
[2:22:35] <%Agami23> yeah
[2:22:35] <%asthanius> tbf, england is gross
[2:22:35] <Badgerconda_> I mean, they do fuck sheep, so that's fair
[2:22:35] <%wolfofsound> @PeachSaliva not those sheep fuckers
[2:22:37] <Grave_Titan_D> oh no the sheep
[2:22:38] <TurtlesAndTentacles> he was deep racist
[2:22:38] <Coystick> The WRONG kind of british
[2:22:42] <%Sotetsu> The horror
[2:22:44] <$rdark_ksu> oh no they were from West England!
[2:22:46] <jetpack_rorschasch> DEAR GOD NOT WELSH! WutFace
[2:22:46] <SGrim> I'm not racist, but the Welsh are a disgusting people. LUL
[2:22:48] <+OverzealousEuthanasiast> seeds of insanity
[2:22:49] <zenith0111> Oh no wonder people cant make a HP Lovecraft game. Makes killing any monster feel incredibly racist
[2:22:49] <Fien111> Cthulhu speak is basically just Welsh, same spelling
[2:22:51] <DancesWitBalrog> Welsh = fish ppl, Mr Lovecraft?
[2:22:57] <+GinAndRoses> yh yo y'm wylsh!
[2:22:58] <%TerpanderLux> EleGiggle
[2:22:59] <Coystick> Welsh and the Irish
[2:22:59] <+D00msDayDan> idk doesn't sound racist to me
[2:22:59] <Treasure_Vault> You should see his views on the Celts
[2:23:02] <%greasypete00> they're literally from whales
[2:23:03] <+Ophill> Welsh DansGame
[2:23:05] <$cooldude69xx> @Puhff We can always separate the art from the artist
[2:23:05] <%asthanius> Have you heard them speak? Basically fish people
[2:23:06] <ExpressNode> Guess he won't like Xenoblade 2
[2:23:06] <studleydoorite> was he wrong
[2:23:06] <%DyslexicWizrad> H.P. also wrote a storying about Atlantis
[2:23:14] <LLCoolZJ> welsh are sheep people not fish
[2:23:15] <+Ches_Neckbeard> well yeah they're sheep fuckers not fish fuckers
[2:23:15] <Coystick> He probably had thoughts on the Scottish too
[2:23:15] <Grave_Titan_D> have you met welsh?
[2:23:18] <@PlagueOfGripes> most of his universe wasn't written by him anyway
[2:23:18] <vulpuspictus> Welsh does sound a lot like fish speak though
[2:23:19] <+swesterly> @Puhff ok woody allen
[2:23:19] <Badgerconda_> Come from whales, their language is strange and sounds like gurgling, it checks out, honestly.
[2:23:22] <Fien111> Meanwhile Xenoblade knows better....they're catfolk
[2:23:23] <%zamatermort> Tbf, the Welsh are fish monsters
[2:23:28] <+whyskeywolfe> Listen, we can all agree the English are history's greatest monsters.
[2:23:30] <SGrim> @PeachSaliva of course, they're fish monsters, they're from WHALES
[2:23:33] <%Pandora_Prime> I mean Osakans are pretty bad. creepy49Porpkek
[2:23:34] <%JoshManVGH> He grew up a rich New Englander in a time where they all had a sick up their ass about being litterally better than everyone.
[2:23:36] <$SinisterBroccoli> have you heard of cold air? his story about how he's scared of air conditioning?
[2:23:37] <+Trimoon333> Honestly Lovecrafts racism is kinda funny
[2:23:44] <+godzookylives> @PeachSaliva he referred to his Jewish wife as "well assimilated"
[2:23:46] <DancesWitBalrog> @llcoolzj so, they're fluffy! <3
[2:23:47] <Mattais88> The welsh always get shit on though
[2:23:51] <zenith0111> @plagueofgripes Who did then?
[2:23:52] <$Puhff> @swesterly go fuck yourself, dont compare me to that pedophile
[2:23:56] <randomlyalwaystired> Sounds like he just kinda hated everyone tbh
[2:23:58] <+notsoy> @JoshManVGH i'm pretty sure new englanders STILL are like that
[2:24:17] <zenith0111> "well assimilated" jesus christ
[2:24:21] <+TopTieramisu> lovecraft definitely was living in his own mental prison
[2:24:27] <Fien111> "You're one of the good ones, honey"
[2:24:27] <+UltraViolet371> yeah you could say he hated everyone but writers
[2:24:29] <@MistyMntns> It was a different time
[2:24:30] <Treasure_Vault> @notsoy As someone currently in New England, the vocabulary has slightly updated since then
[2:24:31] <DancesWitBalrog> @pandora_prime wait what
[2:24:33] <MetalSlimeHunt> Lovecraft's beliefs are kind of funny, but only because they were too fringe to be used as a weapon
[2:24:35] <@PlagueOfGripes> most lovecraftian stories was the creation of a circle of his writer friends
[2:24:35] <BroSage> how to right about fear? literally fear everything and everyone
[2:24:38] <+whyskeywolfe> Lovecraft would definitely have voted for Brexit.
[2:24:40] <@PlagueOfGripes> it varies story to story
[2:24:41] <%JoshManVGH> @notsoy But I AM better than everyone, I just don't hate them for it
[2:24:46] <+Ne1son> Man was severely traumatized by his own existence.
[2:24:49] <$SirGO0SE> LUL
[2:24:50] <%wolfofsound> @PeachSaliva he hated Italians, a crazy take on life
[2:24:52] <zenith0111> LUL
[2:25:06] <%Bluwizard21> I have a family I'm friends with that are jewish they make so many jew jokes it is nuts
[2:25:09] <jetpack_rorschasch> But what if! WutFace
[2:25:09] <@MistyMntns> I just think that He was *super* crazy
[2:25:10] <Coystick> This is the first bit of Progress in 1.5 streams
[2:25:13] <%asthanius> Yeah he would HATE Tifa
[2:25:17] <MetalSlimeHunt> It's true, the entire Weird Stories group shouldn't be reduced to just Lovecraft
[2:25:17] <%wolfofsound> LUL
[2:25:23] <Mattais88> Mor ethat the Chinese are such godless heathens they'd worship seafood
[2:25:23] <jetpack_rorschasch> Fucking lol!
[2:25:25] <thebestesttrashpanda> Are the emissaries in bloodborne just Chinese people
[2:25:26] <Profmcstevie> The cosmic lasagna
[2:25:26] <+Shoosler> he would have liked Tifa though, trust me
[2:25:27] <@MelBrooksKA> He didn't like AC either
[2:25:28] <Explodincatz> we were robbed
[2:25:28] <+ReallyBigRocks> incomprehensible past
[2:25:29] <@commanderclaw> He basically did say she was "one of the good ones, he was going on an anti semitic rant one day, and his wife says "I'm Jewish you know" and he pats her hand and says "No, you're a Lovecraft"
[2:25:29] <Grave_Titan_D> its better to list who did like at this point
[2:25:30] <+Emperor_Machinus> Flying spaghetti monster
[2:25:30] <udurbalanced> August Derleth also wrote some interesting stories
[2:25:30] <%JoshManVGH> It was once said that HP Lovecraft dropped out of school  because "he didn't have the constitution for Math"
[2:25:31] <%DyslexicWizrad> tbf he hated himself
[2:25:31] <my2k_> white guy racism is another level
[2:25:33] <%Th3SmartAlec> I for one welcome the Great Spaghetti Monster
[2:25:35] <DancesWitBalrog> Jojo Spaghetti as a Lovecraft monster would be sick ngl
[2:25:42] <tcosmiclatte> the speget you couldn't forget
[2:25:44] <bossbear> edgar allen poe was a weirdo too
[2:25:49] <+UltraViolet371> Though you can actually see how the tone of his stories changed as he got more open-minded, less horror and more sci-fi
[2:25:54] <+swesterly> @MetalSlimeHunt not to mention weird fiction and cosmic horror are in a renaissance right now
[2:25:56] <AvroEltz> Alien worms that hide in spaghetti and invade your brain and take over your body
[2:25:58] <$rdark_ksu> Oh no its the Baked Ziti of Shogoth!
[2:26:02] <+TopTieramisu> LUL
[2:26:04] <%wolfofsound> @PeachSaliva Imagine being so white you actually judge race on greys of white LUL
[2:26:04] <+sashagreenspiderqueen> @PeachSaliva shockingly, he wrote one of the few anti-colonial science fiction stories from white authors of his era just a year before he died, "in the walls of eryx" about leaving indigenous people (still aliens tho) alone and not pilfering their cultures
[2:26:04] <bossbear> LUL
[2:26:13] <%rekinom> He was also an anti-semite even though his wife was jewish
[2:26:19] <bossbear> of course there is also his poor cat
[2:26:26] <$Puhff> If you think Lovecraft's racism is bad, I have some concerning news about your government officials...
[2:26:27] <DancesWitBalrog> The Spaghetti looked at me, MENANCELY
[2:26:29] <CatRidder> a french doctor in the inside
[2:26:35] <+Ne1son> Everyone here talking about Lovecraft little do they know he was neurodivergent and a minor
[2:26:42] <MetalSlimeHunt> In lighter trivia, Lovecraft also write a detailed essay about why cats are a superior animal to dogs in every respect
[2:26:46] <Ape_Law> lovecraft would have lasted less than a week on twitter, but oh man, what a week
[2:26:51] <bossbear> but he flunked geometry
[2:26:54] <+TopTieramisu> @Puhff i'm sure they're aware of trudeau's proclivities
[2:27:06] <zenith0111> He also had a fling with a college fanboy who they used to wrote notes to each other apparently
[2:27:08] <udurbalanced> He only flunked Euclidean geometry
[2:27:10] <+sashagreenspiderqueen> but then, orson scott card wrote the follow to ender's game as a story about respecting and understanding cultures through empathy and patient communication and hes 👀 not good
[2:27:11] <%JoshManVGH> @bossbear Non-Euclidian shapes!
[2:27:12] <@MistyMntns> If you guys want to know more about Hp Lovecraft, read the Annotated HP Lovecraft. It is all the stories, annotated with historical context, where he got inspiration  and other things like that.
[2:27:19] <bossbear> @JoshManVGH yeah
[2:27:20] <ohno58> That was some real prison shit right there
[2:27:21] <+notsoy> imagine they're women, that should help you kill them
[2:27:24] <DashXero> Might as well take care of the rest.
[2:27:29] <$SinisterBroccoli> Cool Air was lovecrafts story about how air conditioning was evil
[2:27:37] <%wolfofsound> "he came right at me judge"
[2:27:38] <+swesterly> paige you sound like the lapd
[2:27:40] <Grave_Titan_D> no mercy
[2:27:43] <udurbalanced> Schroedinger was a pederast and a kiddie diddler
[2:27:45] <@MistyMntns> No it wasnt
[2:27:45] <%TerpanderLux> yea
[2:27:47] <zenith0111> WHAT
[2:27:47] <metalsiren31> Fuck yeah it was
[2:27:50] <@commanderclaw> YEP
[2:27:50] <DancesWitBalrog> AC existed
[2:27:51] <+notsoy> y'all are making shit up now
[2:27:52] <TheEndlessRiver1> Lovecraft was afraid of basically everything
[2:27:55] <%JoshManVGH> YEAH! it was Brand New when he moved to New York!
[2:27:55] <sun312772> oh yea
[2:27:56] <DashXero> Was there ANYTHING this Lovecraft fellow didn't hate?
[2:27:56] <+Shoosler> no it was
[2:27:56] <+RandyFistburgers> Is there anything he liked besides hate?
[2:27:56] <+TopTieramisu> this chat is full of baiters
[2:27:57] <MetalSlimeHunt> I don't think I can take Orson Scott Card seriously after he wrote Empire, even putting all the other criticism aside
[2:27:57] <@commanderclaw> He was afraid of Air Conditioning
[2:27:57] <bossbear> lovecraft - " OH NO TECHNOLOGY "
[2:27:57] <metalsiren31> READ IT COWARDS
[2:27:58] <DancesWitBalrog> AC existed then?
[2:28:02] <%legendfather_of_giants> @PeachSaliva yeah, Lovecraft didn't hate so mmuch as he was afraid of EVERYTHING not familiar
[2:28:03] <%DianaTheAscian> very old
[2:28:05] <sun312772> that was the whole story
[2:28:05] <ExpressNode> Yep
[2:28:07] <bossbear> yes
[2:28:07] <tanarath> @sinisterbroccoli it's about how it makes you immortal
[2:28:10] <udurbalanced> It's thousands of years old
[2:28:11] <Fien111> Not evil, he just hated being cold
[2:28:12] <$SirGO0SE> Air Conditioning is of the old gods
[2:28:13] <%Pandora_Prime> Paige needs an Adjudicator Shield stat
[2:28:13] <%baka_sugoi> movie theaters and shit
[2:28:13] <skyshinecrusader> Air conditioning had just come out at the time
[2:28:16] <Valentinius_Anodyne> The air conditioning thing is actually true, funnily enough
[2:28:17] <%TerpanderLux> owned
[2:28:18] <+RandyFistburgers> Swamp coolers be old af
[2:28:18] <%wolfofsound> old as fuck, didn't you watch community? @PeachSaliva
[2:28:20] <+Shoosler> ancient egypt had air conditioning
[2:28:22] <zenith0111> Do you know how old FAX amchines REALLY are?
[2:28:26] <bossbear> ( plays poison )
[2:28:27] <+ReallyBigRocks> it was originally for dehumidifying, making the air cold was a side effect
[2:28:29] <DancesWitBalrog> AC is from the Old Ones
[2:28:30] <%asthanius> Lincoln had a fax machine
[2:28:30] <Manwad> What? No. In Dead Air It was just a weirdo wizard who used being cold as his immortality shit. An AC enabled it. No commentary on like, air cons being evil.
[2:28:34] <%Agami23> holy shit, the bloodborne PSX thing just released splitscreen multiplayer
[2:28:40] <+TopTieramisu> LUL
[2:28:43] <+MidnightBurst12> electric AC is the new invention
[2:28:44] <Ape_Law> you did it
[2:28:44] <udurbalanced> Fax machines were contemporary with Abe Lincoln and Samurai
[2:28:45] <+sashagreenspiderqueen> fwiw swamp coolers have existed since before electricity
[2:28:45] <+TopTieramisu> amazing
[2:28:53] <peachy996> @Agami23 Sounds rad
[2:28:56] <jetpack_rorschasch> I get the feeling his abnormal fear of everything gave him the ability to write about the unbearable fear of the unkown.
[2:28:56] <twistedj3ster> Paige just Kylo Ren'd that dude
[2:29:00] <MetalSlimeHunt> Personally, I was a fan of the immortal wizard who turned himself into living salt instead of the one who used AC LUL
[2:29:01] <bossbear> ac was given to us by the ancient dong lords who were followers of shagoth
[2:29:03] <+Ne1son> Its hard to express exactly how fucked up Lovecraft was due to many factors in his life. Man had so many insane phobias
[2:29:07] <%ElkRiverDog> Go watch OSP's Lovecraft Halloween video on YouTube if you want a quick and hilarious summary of that story
[2:29:09] <@MistyMntns> Yall. Read the annotated HP Lovecraft
[2:29:15] <+TopTieramisu> LUL
[2:29:18] <bossbear> LUL
[2:29:19] <LaughingCatt> lobosFall
[2:29:20] <$cooldude69xx> @Manwad Chat in a mood where everything has to be wildly evil because they dont like the guy who wrote it
[2:29:32] <+sashagreenspiderqueen> @PeachSaliva ancient egyptians had early air conditioners that worked through evaporation
[2:29:38] <Fien111> On a related note Lovecraft in Brooklyn by The Mountain Goats is fantastic song
[2:29:43] <usuallysleepy> i always thought this level is one of the most depressing areas in any souls game
[2:29:44] <+TopTieramisu> twitch chat dogpiling on a subject? nooooo
[2:29:49] <%TerpanderLux> monkaS
[2:29:52] <udurbalanced> Yes
[2:29:54] <MetalSlimeHunt> Ok, cooling by evaporation isn't "air conditioning". That's just a basic thing, everyone can do that.
[2:29:57] <%asthanius> Ancient Egypt also had batteries
[2:29:57] <Treasure_Vault> Yeah, with ice?
[2:29:59] <%wolfofsound> @PeachSaliva aliens dummy
[2:30:00] <udurbalanced> AC works on evaporating air which draws away heat
[2:30:01] <LLCoolZJ> They also slept on rocks.
[2:30:01] <+MidnightBurst12> evaporation cools things
[2:30:02] <BroSage> @sashagreenspiderqueen is tru
[2:30:07] <+Shoosler> even the history channel knows that
[2:30:13] <%RetroCop87> they would run small canals through their living spaces to cool the insides down
[2:30:17] <SGrim> @MetalSlimeHunt Are you, or are you not, conditioning the air?
[2:30:18] <%Agami23> egyptians were smart AF. not surprising
[2:30:20] <%g0atmeal> @LaughingCatt lobosWave
[2:30:24] <+polothegreatest> jar+sand+water= old fridge LUL
[2:30:24] <zenith0111> Makes sense tho given how fast we figured out plumbing and water control with aquaducts
[2:30:25] <Manwad> There's a Lovecraft story about a guy who lays curses on people who wronged him. The protagonist got cursed. Turns out the curse was the guy just breaking into their house and killing them.
[2:30:26] <bossbear> also there are the hanging garden's which are fucking wild to read about
[2:30:36] <MetalSlimeHunt> No like, wear a damp t-shirt if you're oveheating at night. The evaporation will keep you icy cold. Don't try this if the air is humid though.
[2:30:40] <udurbalanced> @Manwad Simple and effective
[2:30:41] <Explodincatz> lemma guess, Zuko has a scar on him?
[2:30:42] <+ReallyBigRocks> air conditioning is called that because it conditions the air e.g. removes moisture. the cooling is a side effect of the process
[2:30:48] <jetpack_rorschasch> The Egyptians also invented Go Karts LUL
[2:30:48] <Ozavic> Thank you, I'm sitting with my boys now
[2:30:49] <Ape_Law> you're a hero
[2:30:53] <@MistyMntns> Its like the burning of the Libary of Alexandria put our world back  by like 1000 years.
[2:31:00] <bossbear> I wonder if hp lovecraft did a thing on pot people ?
[2:31:00] <critiquequartz> Wait till pat hears about how old plumbing is
[2:31:09] <zenith0111> @mistymntns OOF
[2:31:10] <%Bluwizard21> Egyptians also made fridges around the same time as the middle eastern cultures did
[2:31:10] <+swesterly> @MistyMntns sure it did
[2:31:12] <$cooldude69xx> @Manwad Scariest curse of all: a knife
[2:31:13] <+TopTieramisu> pot bois
[2:31:17] <bossbear> boys are born outta pots in demon souls
[2:31:17] <+Shoosler> @MetalSlimeHunt they literally had a method to cool the air in a room, not just cool down a person with a wet tshirt lmao
[2:31:19] <MetalSlimeHunt> But yes, in theory you can put a bucket of water in a hot and dry room, and it'll cool it down.
[2:31:21] <%TerpanderLux> chjbDance
[2:31:28] <jetpack_rorschasch> There are boys in these pots!
[2:31:32] <SGrim> @Agami23 Egyptians were as smart as any other people group, but had a writing systems sufficient to past more advanced knowledge reliably between generations.
[2:31:32] <+TopTieramisu> a stray chjb
[2:31:36] <%realm_forge> POT SQUAD
[2:31:38] <Ape_Law> get em
[2:31:38] <udurbalanced> I don't think the burning of Alexandria did as much harm as people think.  Engineering is applying real world observations to technology, not an arcane science
[2:31:45] <MetalSlimeHunt> @Shoosler It's the exact same physical principle, just applied more effectively
[2:31:51] <bossbear> oh hey Cthulhu  bro
[2:31:59] <@MistyMntns> Man now I am remembering the one line from Spaceship Earth in Epcot.
[2:32:01] <+swesterly> @udurbalanced exactly, hard to imagine how alexandria imapcted the maya
[2:32:06] <+Shoosler> @MetalSlimeHunt thus it was air conditioning
[2:32:07] <usuallysleepy> kinda hard to imagine that at one point, the 3 major abrahamic faiths managed to come together to collaborate and share human knowledge in the Iberian region, and then was totally torn up with crusader warfare
[2:32:09] <@MistyMntns> Remember the Phonetians, you can thank them for your ABCs
[2:32:11] <+rafaelba93> thats not a doctor page
[2:32:15] <zenith0111> Next thing theyre going to be like "Egyptians had VR and Lovecraft thought it was witchcraft"
[2:32:16] <bossbear> atleast they don't suck out insight Kappa
[2:32:32] <+Emperor_Machinus> @MistyMntns Which annoted one? there is a 2014 and a 2019
[2:32:36] <@MistyMntns> Both
[2:32:39] <%Bluwizard21> @MistyMntns Phonetians are from Phoenix
[2:32:41] <udurbalanced> It's the same problem with Ancient Aliens.  Engineers design things based on how the world works. Physics hasn't changed.

[2:34:26] <%g0atmeal> an ELDEN lady in GOLDEN clothes with RING shaped hair??
[2:34:38] <$rdark_ksu> Paige shares many traits with the common crow. The most obvious is a love of shiny
[2:34:47] <jetpack_rorschasch> IT'S ALL CONNECTED! PogChamp
[2:34:57] <+swesterly> she doesn't have  anme she is just some guy's wife
[2:34:57] <bossbear> just some cool chick
[2:35:04] <@PlagueOfGripes> I hate it when people apply continuity from later games to ones made like 10-20 years prior
[2:35:11] <+ReallyBigRocks> :)
[2:35:17] <%TheYellowcouch> she's got some rockin boobs
[2:35:18] <@MistyMntns> @Emperor_Machinus The first one has the more famous stories.
[2:35:27] <DancesWitBalrog> FUCK THE CHURCH

[2:35:36] <+D00msDayDan> halo fans are so bad about that
[2:35:37] <MetalSlimeHunt> King's Field 2 is canon to Dark Souls 3 and I won't hear otherwise
[2:35:37] <+swesterly> @PlagueOfGripes don't you also hate it when fromsoft makes games that aren't dark souls 1
[2:35:38] <%RetroCop87> Plague hating something inconsequential?
[2:35:39] <@PlagueOfGripes> It just made me think of a Zelda video I watched yesterday
[2:35:40] <afrotoa> She looks like she needs a hug

[2:35:53] <@PlagueOfGripes> the point of that video is how awful it was
[2:35:57] <zenith0111> damn
[2:36:00] <udurbalanced> The later continuity applied to the same story as the old games, so why not recognize the connection?
[2:36:02] <+Emperor_Machinus> @MistyMntns thank you. Maybe next paycheck for the second book
[2:36:06] <ohno58> Need another dbz gripes video.

[2:45:04] <vVAstrAVv> the mines are easy you just want her to power level
[2:45:05] <+rafaelba93> wall skip makes it easy]
[2:45:13] <jetpack_rorschasch> Paige needs the true true!
[2:45:18] <%Agami23> hell she could just run past adjudicator if she really wanted
[2:45:23] <ohno58> Paige afraid of spooders?
[2:45:26] <bossbear> paige has alot of problems with the spiders
[2:45:33] <bossbear> if anybody remembers muffet Kappa
[2:45:35] <MetalSlimeHunt> Armor Spider is Miyazaki's letter of hatred to people with arachnophobia. I don't even have arachnophobia and I hate it.
[2:45:36] <AlaridKonz> what do the numbers mean?
[2:45:37] <udurbalanced> Didn't Paige get smoked here a lot ?
[2:45:46] <vVAstrAVv> yeah why would paige panic over adjudicator lol
[2:45:48] <+rafaelba93> does wall skip works in remake
[2:45:51] <+rafaelba93> ?
[2:45:54] <+notsoy> the skellies aren't the problem anymore, fat boy is now
[2:45:58] <rReizs> armour spider also camps like a coward while trying to slow you
[2:46:04] <%Pandora_Prime> Get her the shield it will solve many problem
[2:46:17] <+UltraViolet371> help, I want to be playing elden ring right now hhnnng it's bad today
[2:46:27] <MetalSlimeHunt> The fact that the animation is so good in this remake definitely doesn't help. That thing moves and looks like an honest to god real giant fucking spider
[2:46:29] <+D00msDayDan> don't you guys remember? get her a shield and she'll start rolling instead
[2:46:33] <Ape_Law> oh, elden ring

[2:47:01] <%asthanius> Elden Toilet Seat

[2:47:17] <bossbear> Kappa
[2:47:19] <%asthanius> you fucked the toilet?
[2:47:21] <%BlackMage66652> What kind of degenerate wants a cold toilet?

[2:48:06] <%Th3SmartAlec> lewd
[2:48:06] <%RetroCop87> tldr, Pat fucked up the toilet and his weak baby arms can't clean up after himself
[2:48:06] <ohno58> hot
[2:48:06] <Ape_Law> hey, it wasn't a one shot this time
[2:48:06] <%Sotetsu> Pat has to wash his own feet now

[2:48:11] <+Your_Lord_and_Senpai> LUL

[2:48:36] <%cade_calrayn> that was extremely lewd
[2:48:50] <ohno58> A souls classic
[2:48:51] <%JoshManVGH> I am perplexed still at how a toilet could be so fucked that it needs a steel pad.
[2:49:02] <jetpack_rorschasch> The toilet keeps getting clogged because Pat has to mush the shit between his toes after taking a shit. LUL
[2:49:14] <%asthanius> excuse is brain bad sometimes
[2:49:29] <Jaysky> Girl you do better with faster games like Bloodborne
[2:49:35] <%superc37> I thinks its bc ds1 had poise and armor that had actual defense

[2:53:34] <%Agami23> no i think the shittiest is bringing that back for DS2
[2:53:36] <YelloGek> I didn't know someone could look like a cop like that
[2:53:51] <+HelveticaScenario> Pat, Paige can shoot those manta rays out of the sky with her magic
[2:53:55] <%vivaciouseff> @Agami23 agreed, but more ring slots made it not as shit as it couda been
[2:53:57] <Ape_Law> this is never gonna get a pc port and that makes me sad
[2:54:01] <+patriotrenegade> The parry window on the gold skeletons is so hilarious
[2:54:17] <@PlagueOfGripes> psycho mantis rays

[2:58:30] <Ziegsy> my copy of elden ring is at the postoffice 20 mins from my house and I cant get it till monday ziegsyChaos
[2:58:32] <+patriotrenegade> Whyd you buy digital lol
[2:58:42] <+sniffy77> Lucky biiiiiitches
[2:58:42] <ChungusQuest> I found out from a reddit post this morning that my PC stats didn't cut muster for Elden Ring. I am now $2000 poorer.
[2:58:52] <%DianaTheAscian> does it even work?
[2:58:59] <%SaiyanShoto> Did you guys get Elden Ring chocolate?
[2:59:03] <torruun_ralliot> Paige trying to trigger the skellymans. smh
[2:59:07] <%MooseIsGoose> The thief ring made them not go down stairs
[2:59:12] <$EsotericOdyssey> @ChungusQuest idk if mine will work, but I can run DS3 and Sekiro just fine
[2:59:21] <+sniffy77> stream it under Artifact
[2:59:29] <Ziegsy> I bought mine from an indie store online thats just too lazy to wait
[2:59:35] <$EsotericOdyssey> my graphics card is slightly better than I need but my processor is slightly worse
[2:59:39] <ohno58> PC version might be doodoo
[2:59:40] <%rekinom> My new CPU will be here a day before elden ring
[2:59:40] <+ReallyBigRocks> wack
[2:59:41] <@PlagueOfGripes> I'll probably have to do a real playthrough and an LP playthrough
[2:59:44] <%Th3SmartAlec> oh joy
[2:59:47] <%TerpanderLux> my cousin is getting me a key for the pc version moon2W
[2:59:49] <%Agami23> i cant even run it even if i wanted so im going with ps4
[2:59:50] <dzmi13> The other day someone was streaming their review copy of elden ring :(
[2:59:52] <Ape_Law> pc version so you can mod the horse into a crab
[2:59:53] <twistedj3ster> oh no my 1650
[2:59:53] <+bluedude153> Not if I bought in on Green man Gaming a week ago during a sale :/
[2:59:54] <+Caped_Eggy> Shit
[2:59:54] <+kewlmyc> I got it on CDKeys though....
[2:59:54] <+Akizea> yeah i just refunded my pc copy and just switched it to ps5
[2:59:54] <Kronark> What if I bought a key from a third party site.....
[2:59:56] <+HelveticaScenario> Concerns over a pc release...you don't say LUL
[2:59:56] <+patriotrenegade> Console Kings rise up
[2:59:58] <+eanscrale> I just hope they fixed THAT exploit
[3:00:00] <bossbear> yey
[3:00:01] <%DianaTheAscian> the PC version being fucky is on brand
[3:00:03] <%Th3SmartAlec> Kappa
[3:00:06] <+Ne1son> Oh yeah let me just get my ps5 out
[3:00:07] <+WackyGear> @PeachSaliva what issues with the PC version?
[3:00:10] <+Emperor_Machinus> I got pre-ordered for my Ps5
[3:00:13] <%RetroCop87> how long until the cip supply catches up?
[3:00:14] <%the22cstomp> thanks crypto
[3:00:14] <+HelveticaScenario> This is why I'm playing that on PS5
[3:00:15] <%Dakuu75> Pat, was there any news on the potential hacking-threat, of playing online?
[3:00:16] <+Felhad> Im gunna play it on XSEX
[3:00:17] <+Your_Lord_and_Senpai> LUL a PS5
[3:00:18] <@MistyMntns> Damn CHIP SHORTAGE
[3:00:19] <%kyh9> @Bane_Kaikyo Thanks for the gift sub!
[3:00:20] <@PlagueOfGripes> unless you want to use buyer roulette apps
[3:00:22] <jetpack_rorschasch> Yeah, the PS5s we ALL have. NotLikeThis
[3:00:22] <%DianaTheAscian> We should kill scalpers
[3:00:24] <Kronark> Dark Souls 3 and Sekiro were pretty solid though...
[3:00:24] <%Agami23> get elden ring on ps4 and it gives you the PS5 version too!
[3:00:28] <rReizs> ps4 it is?
[3:00:29] <koffeemancer> my copy of elden ring was a gift so even it runs bad imma still play it
[3:00:30] <Ziegsy> are you telling me I could take my aunts boobs to sony and get them to make me a ps5?
[3:00:30] <%kyh9> Sony could set up, I don't know, A FUCKING QUEUE
[3:00:31] <%greasypete00> I'm confident the stutter will get fixed
[3:00:34] <%kyh9> OR THE RETAILERS COULD
[3:00:35] <Cynical2DD> I just want to play FF7 Intergrade but i cant get a 5
[3:00:36] <+TungstenoViperante> Stuttering that can be fixed with Vsync???
[3:00:39] <%zamatermort> Network test worked well enough on my ps4, so whatever
[3:00:44] <%kyh9> JUST GIVE ME A LIST TO PUT MY NAME ON AND ILL WAIT MY TURN TO BUY A PS5
[3:00:47] <darkodargon> Is it true its like 70GB
[3:00:48] <%rekinom> @TungstenoViperante No
[3:00:50] <+patriotrenegade> Yeah, Elon Musk's coup in Bolivia didn't pan out and now we dont have enough silicon because the Bolivian government is socialist
[3:00:53] <+OneTrueAsshat> Lance also said he's not worried bout it and that it will probably be patched day 1
[3:00:58] <twistedj3ster> @kyh9 I"M IN THE Q
[3:01:02] <+Emperor_Machinus> I spent 2 hours spamming the buy button on gamestop last year...
[3:01:04] <+ReallyBigRocks> but also PC gaming is all One Guys who have the weirdest issues that no one else has
[3:01:06] <%kyh9> @twistedj3ster Is there a queue?
[3:01:06] <+patriotrenegade> And something something worker's rights
[3:01:13] <+TungstenoViperante> @rekinom i confused stuttering with screen tearing...
[3:01:15] <Ape_Law> the stuttering is a shader issue, drivers or a patch will fix it
[3:01:21] <%Agami23> isnt there a decoy item in this?
[3:01:25] <%rekinom> @TungstenoViperante Easy mistake to make, no worries
[3:01:29] <@PlagueOfGripes> isn't the black katana skeleton and blackened skeleton with a katana and not a skeleton with a black katana
[3:01:31] <twistedj3ster> @kyh9 Yeah, sony's own site, they'll send you an email
[3:01:35] <%kyh9> I'm gonna get it on Series X
[3:01:37] <earthboy2k> isn't it like 45-50fps on ps5
[3:01:43] <%kyh9> @twistedj3ster Cool, I'll try that
[3:01:49] <bossbear> 80 gb on ps5 .... interesting
[3:01:53] <ohno58> BBS
[3:01:57] <+eanscrale> wtf why is it 80 gigs?
[3:01:58] <+patriotrenegade> black skeleton
[3:01:59] <bossbear> also there is always ps4 Kappa
[3:02:01] <LaughingCatt> Black Dual Katana Skeleton
[3:02:05] <@PlagueOfGripes> angry sksleton
[3:02:05] <ChungusQuest> Skeleton, katana, black
[3:02:11] <%Dakuu75> Is it still unsafe to play Elden Ring online, because of hacks?
[3:02:21] <+ReallyBigRocks> is 80gb not like standard for AAA games these days?
[3:02:22] <+Felhad> Cause its a big modern open world game?
[3:02:25] <%rekinom> One of the friendly NPC summons in elden ring has his name censored. "vagabond" becomes "***abond"
[3:02:25] <bossbear> just looked it up and on pc its apparently 60gb un patched , gotta remember that
[3:02:30] <+patriotrenegade> youre just gonna have to chain backstab him
[3:02:48] <Ape_Law> shrecked
[3:02:49] <%greasypete00> hacks will probably happen even with easyanticheat
[3:02:51] <jetpack_rorschasch> Now kill what you love most!
[3:02:57] <iosephe> It's probably safe
[3:02:58] <linSP> i was playing ds2 when the servers went down and got worried that i got softbanned
[3:02:58] <bossbear> ironic
[3:03:00] <%MooseIsGoose> I lame him out and shoot through the broken archway
[3:03:02] <ohno58> use fire?
[3:03:10] <bossbear> @linSP same
[3:03:45] <iosephe> Can't really predict which game or software will have a zero day RCE exploit next
[3:03:51] <%Agami23> cant paige use soul remains to lure the black katana skeleton out?
[3:04:05] <Karglin> Why not aggro with fire from distance and climb ladder then shoot down?
[3:04:21] <+Emperor_Machinus> @linSP I got soft banned on DS3 when my save got corrupted and replaced it with a copy pasted version of the same save I did.
[3:04:36] <+notsoy> she's also walking all the way around back out of the backstab arc
[3:05:02] <+eanscrale> Yeah From's cheat detection is... bad.
[3:05:15] <BroSage> fire works well for the BKS
[3:05:40] <linSP> @Emperor_Machinus that sucks, basically theres no way to recover a botched save because messing with it will fail the check with from's servers
[3:06:11] <Jaysky> y'all play online?
[3:06:22] <+Emperor_Machinus> @linSP I did not know that at the time unfortunately, now I am stuck on the cheaters gulag
[3:06:56] <BigYanno> Pat tell her she's doing great
[3:07:23] <%MooseIsGoose> nice
[3:07:25] <+DeaconBluesClues> just shoot him then run up da ladder
[3:07:35] <Ell1ot> just say drop your shield
[3:07:35] <TheHeroAppears> you can feel paige start to lose as pats mouth opens

[3:12:35] <+Emperor_Machinus> @Shinted24 that bring up implication of blanket/sleeve stuff
[3:12:38] <studleydoorite> LUL these streams are just voice-controlled LPs for Pat

[3:15:48] <%Agami23> i hope theres a part in elden ring thats similar to the 3-2
[3:15:51] <$EsotericOdyssey> I CLENCHED
[3:15:58] <$EsotericOdyssey> I clenched watching this
[3:16:01] <@PlagueOfGripes> the elden ring turned into a tree!
[3:16:02] <bossbear> LUL
[3:16:17] <%Dakuu75> sic
[3:16:23] <Treasure_Vault> ofc, sans undertale
[3:16:25] <%greasypete00> if its actually in sekiro world that would be cool i think
[3:16:30] <bossbear> oh you were there all along .... my guiding umbasa
[3:16:31] <torruun_ralliot> I remember when Gascoigne said "umbasa" and everyone lost their minds
[3:16:37] <+Emperor_Machinus> Could the elder ring be realted to tree rings?
[3:16:58] <+BuckChuckman> Umbussy
[3:17:00] <@PlagueOfGripes> from is so used to reusing ideas and not caring that trying to tie their games together is both easy and totally pointless
[3:17:06] <studleydoorite> I saw umbasa burned in my toast this morning
[3:17:10] <Ziegsy> the elden ring is an eclipse. duh
[3:17:15] <atlasdotwav> Blew through that area like it was nothing
[3:17:20] <%asthanius> Demons Souls has climbing it's weird
[3:17:30] <MetalSlimeHunt> Climbing in a souls game? RUINED
[3:17:30] <%bevyrage> it's specific zone climbing
[3:17:39] <californaya> The Elden Ring is the friends we made along the way
[3:17:42] <+RedMaskBandit> HE FIGURED IT OUT
[3:17:44] <%bevyrage> only some ledges let you climb up them and even then it's usually one small spot on 'em
[3:17:59] <wolverinewaswrong> I remember when people tried to link demons and ds1
[3:18:06] <%Agami23> im guessing elden ring with be a fromsoft greatest hits
[3:18:08] <%g0atmeal> sword... you mean like the SWORD saint?!?
[3:18:12] <Ape_Law> elden ring is kings field
[3:18:14] <Manwad> I fucking hope Totally Not White Glint is in Elden ring
[3:18:20] <BroSage> we liked it so they put a ring on it
[3:18:24] <@PlagueOfGripes> I would much much rather not. I prefer not to think of dark souls 2 or 3 as being related at all
[3:18:26] <Kronark> I thought that Dark Souls 3 made it pretty clear that the Dark Age was inevitable
[3:18:27] <DracaenaLeaf> LUL
[3:18:37] <bossbear> I like it when they just do lil easter eggs or of course the holy moonlight blade , few things will be cool as a weapon shootin laser beams
