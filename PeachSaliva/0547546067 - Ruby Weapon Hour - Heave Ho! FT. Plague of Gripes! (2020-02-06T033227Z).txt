[3:05:36] <wsintai> @SvenHolgersson You want to add abortion to it too? Damn bro
[3:05:49] <+captain_tsoon> Now we're getting some where
[3:05:54] <%K2YP70C0CK> Prometheus david doodSick
[3:05:57] <zamzoph> @PeachSaliva What about FF4?
[3:05:58] <%ssjklyco> after she revives yang
[3:06:01] <NeroInfinite> Taintstain
[3:06:14] <ShichiNoBushi> Like a beer stein?
[3:06:14] <%SvenHolgersson> @wsintai Listen I gotta cover all the bases my commissions dont pay for themselves
[3:06:26] <GraceTBM> hows them eye doctor coming along paaaige @PeachSaliva
[3:06:27] <+lethallunacyx> If it's not taintstain, we've all failed
[3:06:28] <Valdorick> Paige is are Pregerrntee?
[3:06:30] <%prism_zet> @peachsaliva pat wanting to reincarnate like piccolo spitting up an egg made me think of that
[3:06:35] <%Coystick> Plague is my wife
[3:06:43] <%K2YP70C0CK> taintstain doodGood
[3:06:50] <zamzoph> Plague isn't a character?
[3:06:54] <%Jekado> crazy farmer man?
[3:06:57] <$Sphincter_Spelunker> gripe man
[3:06:58] <+captain_tsoon> Everyone plays a character, Paige
[3:06:59] <ShichiNoBushi> It's an online persona.
[3:07:04] <worldbrand> where does plague end and the gripes begin?
[3:07:05] <Valdorick> "Fence man"
[3:07:12] <%Coystick> Paige pls tell me you're playing a character too for the love of God.
[3:07:16] <%Jekado> like a purer form of yourself
[3:07:18] <+EpsilonDSC> @PeachSaliva Everyone puts on a character
[3:07:18] <%GarbageNirvana> It was basically the Channel Awesome way of doing YT vids
[3:07:21] <$Sphincter_Spelunker> Flanderize yourself
[3:07:24] <%SvenHolgersson> It's like turning yourself up to 11 like all the time
[3:07:26] <ryderbootz> plague is a furry, eli is a fence maker
[3:07:28] <%GarbageNirvana> And then most of those people turned out to be assholes
[3:07:31] <%GarbageNirvana> So like
[3:07:35] <Louie_Salmon> There's a fitting Batman quote here
[3:07:40] <+EpsilonDSC> James is such a cool dude.
[3:07:41] <%ElenaManetta> its why everyone thinks paige and pat are doing a bit
[3:07:42] <Louie_Salmon> About masks and wearing them
[3:07:49] <ShichiNoBushi> How much of James Rolfe is Board James?
[3:07:51] <+Estuko> AVGN is such a nice guy
[3:07:54] <$Sphincter_Spelunker> @ElenaManetta it's NOT?
[3:07:54] <%SoFarFetched> Paige IS a character
[3:07:54] <%Neo_Kaiser> AVGN is still entertaining to watch.
[3:07:56] <Arek_1> The persona is more hammed up.
[3:07:57] <+captain_tsoon> Paige please be wrong
[3:07:57] <%CopperTucker> Plague sounds hot tbh
[3:07:58] <+lethallunacyx> Wait you actually watch anime? what a nerd
[3:08:00] <TheArrow_> he doesn't even build fences anymore
[3:08:02] <Dhurkst> yyyyup
[3:08:02] <bettysharkface> The Joji Filthy Frank issue
[3:08:05] <+EpsilonDSC> holy shit
[3:08:07] <%Neo_Kaiser> AVGN has aged like fine wine.
[3:08:08] <worldbrand> you're cartoons
[3:08:11] <%K2YP70C0CK> pro twitch actor
[3:08:12] <zamzoph> Plague is totally a character
[3:08:13] <%ssjklyco> You are your character Paige
[3:08:13] <%SvenHolgersson> You've let too much of yourself slip through WE KNOW YOU TOO GOOD NOW
[3:08:14] <+jiggy_snipe> Pat acts like he's not a character but it's actually hyper him
[3:08:14] <oniwahoo> A Perpetual State of Character
[3:08:18] <JunkyardCrow> Brutal Plague LUL
[3:08:18] <+wingblade7> Always on is a great way to describe these lovable idiots
[3:08:20] <%Jekado> farmer plague complaining about their kids and their animus and how they won't stay off his lawn
[3:08:28] <%SoFarFetched> LUL
[3:08:36] <%K2YP70C0CK> woolieMIRIN

[3:08:54] <%peachy996> PatSalivaGripesAt
[3:08:56] <NeroInfinite> Boil it
[3:08:57] <worldbrand> it absolutely helps

[3:09:16] <%ElenaManetta> use the free one the dentist gives you every 6 months
[3:09:19] <%Jekado> the boiling water would be bad for that then?
[3:09:20] <+lethallunacyx> Fuckin why waist the water? lol
[3:09:25] <%peachy996> This stream is officially the Devil
[3:09:30] <%Jekado> wouldn't plastic be more wasteful
[3:09:31] <ryderbootz> use a different finger for brushing every time
[3:09:31] <%SvenHolgersson> Naruto toothbrush?
[3:09:31] <+lethallunacyx> Why waste 5 dollars?
[3:09:31] <%peachy996> Hooray!
[3:09:36] <NeroInfinite> yes
[3:09:36] <%Jekado> yeah
[3:09:37] <$Sphincter_Spelunker> gotta get the poo particles off the toothbrush if you keep it in the bathroom

[3:10:00] <Alchemystee> those "sticks" are still around actually, some that i know use it for whitening too
[3:10:00] <cureneckbeard> they used actual sticks, in england
[3:10:05] <+theobble> paige knows because she was there
[3:10:07] <%IMDRanged> I'm doing it...
[3:10:08] <ha2ken> My old man used to use the side of his finger as a toothbrush...life was hard back them...
[3:10:11] <+dcn2049> datun
[3:10:11] <NeroInfinite> Egypt and american indians did that
[3:10:20] <worldbrand> we just also didnt have food and drinks that were 50% sugar back then, though
[3:10:24] <%ssjklyco> Where do you get tapping from chewing
[3:10:26] <ryderbootz> talk about the mystical tooth demons!

[3:16:22] <%peachy996> I've alwaysbeen up late
[3:16:42] <Huntercd> Damn vampires
[3:16:50] <%ElenaManetta> that game drove me crazy
[3:17:06] <+Konquerer> bullshit
[3:17:12] <%SvenHolgersson> BULLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLSHIT
[3:17:20] <rathom2ndgig> Super butter buns’ video on DBD kills me daily
[3:17:22] <%king_wragles> @PeachSaliva probably one of Plague's better videos too
[3:17:28] <EuropanLamprey> BULLSHIT
[3:17:29] <oniwahoo> That was a good video
[3:17:33] <+lethallunacyx> It takes teamwork to become a fucking tailed beast monster?!
[3:17:39] <%Coystick> I'M SO FUCKING MAD ABOUT ANIME AAAARRRRUGGGGHHH
[3:17:40] <%Neo_Kaiser> Ew
[3:17:44] <%SvenHolgersson> It was about how much Naruto fucking sucks shit
[3:17:52] <%ssjklyco> does it count if the team is made up of shadowclones of yourself?
[3:17:54] <rathom2ndgig> Well you were right tho plague
[3:17:57] <%Jekado> but Tien tho
[3:17:59] <%SvenHolgersson> Now is Naruto worse than Bleach?
[3:18:04] <Valdorick> Plague of Gripes, the DBZ channel?
[3:18:05] <oniwahoo> Naruto the self made hypocrite
[3:18:18] <+captain_tsoon> A team of 1 multiplied by a thousand
[3:18:21] <%Jekado> dosen't he have like a demon in him with infinite energy or something?
[3:18:23] <%prism_zet> bleach is still empty calories
[3:18:25] <$Sphincter_Spelunker> I went back and read bleach. Big mistake
[3:18:26] <%peachy996> Bleach was really hard to watch sometime but...I didn't watch Naruto
[3:18:30] <cureneckbeard> Naruto the Hypocrite is such a good video
[3:18:34] <peyodogo> I mean tbf plague's pretty on the money for the most part
[3:18:39] <%SvenHolgersson> They're both shitty
[3:18:42] <+TheMattman1313> FUCK YOU SASUKE YOU ARE MY NAKAMA
[3:18:47] <+lethallunacyx> But you legit convinced people (pat) that it was completely true
[3:18:48] <rathom2ndgig> It’s dumb stupid anime
[3:18:50] <%ShockzNDrawe> The writer literally made it all up as he went. Itachi originally was just an actual murdering psychopath
[3:19:11] <%ShockzNDrawe> Plague is his online persona
[3:19:14] <TonberryLives> You can still hate something in principle but still not give a fuck about it personally.
[3:19:14] <$Sphincter_Spelunker> Zebra cum
[3:19:16] <%SvenHolgersson> What a hackfraud
[3:19:17] <%ShockzNDrawe> as opposed to Eli
[3:19:25] <cureneckbeard> like how pat pretends to be angry
[3:19:28] <%SvenHolgersson> Some good designs though
[3:19:35] <%SoFarFetched> plague just suddenly mutters "Ritual of blood ritual of blood ritual of blood"
[3:19:38] <%peachy996> Parts of Bleach were cool/fun but there was too much garbage filler and okubo is kind of a hack
[3:19:48] <+theobble> WOW
[3:19:52] <%SoFarFetched> LUL
[3:19:55] <+jiggy_snipe> LUL

[3:20:01] <%walternatorz> uhhhh
[3:20:03] <%CopperTucker> Plague you're definitely as much of a character as Pat and Paige
[3:20:04] <ShichiNoBushi> Any time anyone is interacting with another person, they are trying to impress someone including themselves.
[3:20:06] <+dcn2049> Hahahahahaaaa
[3:20:08] <+jiggy_snipe> Eli is an interesting gentleman
[3:20:09] <damienlunas> Eli does have some crazy takes
[3:20:13] <%ShockzNDrawe> oh god does Paiige not know what a persona is either
[3:20:13] <%Jekado> what about muppet ville paige?
[3:20:14] <%GarbageNirvana> Get you a gun with cartoon bullets that can't shoot for shit
[3:20:15] <oniwahoo> Eli the Plague Cartoon
[3:20:24] <Arek_1> Naruto is an Übermensch and Sasuke is a nihilist.
[3:20:25] <%SvenHolgersson> Cool World was weird

[3:20:57] <cureneckbeard> more like no guy buy
[3:21:04] <GraceTBM> that no man's sky video is a little overtalked
[3:21:11] <%Jekado> bye paige

[3:21:13] <%ShockzNDrawe> bye bye
[3:21:14] <%SvenHolgersson> Night fuckos
