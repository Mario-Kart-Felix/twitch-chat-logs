[0:08:51] <Feragorn> the green boomer
[0:08:55] <AncelDeLambert> if you can still stomach webcomics, and sprite webcomics especially, go look up Captain SNES, which parodies Captain N but with swearing

[0:09:39] <R3Roundabout> but only above the mouth

[0:22:00] <ch1nesegooseberry> He was based on Albert Einstein, who isn't too popular in Japan for some reason
[0:22:03] <+Mekhet09> It's because the japanese are still upset about nukes pat.

[0:28:13] <+Jessie_Lockhart> Its a classic issue with shows like this from 80s and 90s where there are tons of animation and coloring errors
[0:28:14] <+swid_harry> Audrey 2 is awesome

[0:30:53] <+Jessie_Lockhart> Eggplant Wizard from Kid Icarus
[0:30:54] <+pectusumbra> To be fair aren't they like recurring nemesis or something?
[0:31:01] <+SvenHolgersson> She is a sin against Videogame God

[0:31:27] <+redthebaron> just pointing that gun
[0:31:34] <codiekitty> ONE! Ah ah ah!
[0:31:44] <JackofKnights> dracula is public domain though
[0:31:45] <+Theora_Jones> I love the weird-ass combination of characters they chose for this series. Especially the sentient Game Boy that shows up eventually.
[0:31:48] <+DJ_Androm3da_OFFICIAL> One, two, THREE lawsuits! Ah ah ah!
[0:31:56] <Feragorn> sesame street bought the licensing rights
[0:32:04] <+Theora_Jones> Dr. Acula

[0:32:21] <%noahammerman> that's a real gun kevin has there
[0:32:32] <CalderGaming> Steelbeak?!
[0:32:36] <+swid_harry> why is mega man green
[0:32:44] <+Jessie_Lockhart> Reality is the artists and writers were handed the boxes and thats it. They based all this on loose ideas. Plus they were probably AF on coke.
[0:32:49] <codiekitty> He has the Leaf Shield on.
[0:32:57] <majindusto> Still not as bad as Captain N version of Alucard
[0:32:57] <+Totally_Not_Toby> that's pretty raw
[0:33:08] <+redthebaron> he has a gun and really doesn't have any trigger discipline
[0:33:10] <Finakala> Pat's 86 confirmed
[0:33:11] <+Theora_Jones> Alucard with his sweet blond bouffont?

[0:34:24] <+Theora_Jones> I'm not gonna admit how old I am, but I definitely watched this shit when it first aired.

[0:34:29] <DetroitSentai> Roughnecks
[0:34:30] <+SolidusRex> There was a Starship Trooper cartoon for kids

[0:36:23] <ammobasket> "Justice is slow but inevitable"
[0:36:25] <+Jessie_Lockhart> It did not take itself seriously
[0:36:35] <+Theora_Jones> Oh lort, did anyone else see "Our RoboCop Remake," with the scene that's just RoboCop shooting like a million dicks?
[0:36:40] <+LiquidDinosaur> what about the scene where he shoots a billion jillion guys in the dick
[0:36:51] <+LiquidDinosaur> @Theora_Jones jinx
[0:36:54] <Naho_Saenoki> @Theora_Jones That's the only scene of it I saw.
[0:36:56] <%noahammerman> not a good time for "what if we made a cop but stronger"
[0:36:59] <theleggedone> People still don't get Starship Troopers
[0:37:00] <+Gouf_Troop> ITS AFRAID
[0:37:01] <+thegreenbenis> Robocop the dick slayer
[0:37:05] <+Jessie_Lockhart> Humans were the monsters all along
[0:37:05] <+Theora_Jones> @LiquidDinosaur Great minds and all that

[0:39:44] <+michingmallecho> I disagree, there‚Äôs a lot of metaphor in his gun being stolen. The gun represents his masculinity and now he‚Äôs impotent. Captain N is real deep

[0:40:29] <+LiquidDinosaur> This is Papyrus but accidentally
[0:40:31] <PettyFunk> It literally looks like Papyrus in his COOL DUDE costume
[0:40:32] <+inktoxicant> Mister Steal Your Girl (If You're Pat)
[0:40:37] <+NitronStreams> holy shit it is 90s papyrus
[0:41:09] <+Theora_Jones> It's the same thing as those Halloween masks that come with a plastic shirt that say the name of the thing you're dressed as.

[0:43:01] <ammobasket> Mr Bones is the editor and wanted a bit part
[0:43:04] <codiekitty> Shame Mr. Bones wasn't one of those red skeletons that reforms after you kill them.

[0:50:55] <jdllama> She's like a fish
[0:50:55] <morningmoondude> Very carefully
[0:50:55] <+BinaryFireball> she gave birth from her teeth
[0:51:01] <+Totally_Not_Toby> no part of this makes sense
[0:51:04] <jdllama> so she spreads her eggs along the bottom of the vat
[0:51:05] <PettyFunk> They installed a little keg tap into her tank, she gave birth out of that
[0:51:08] <CzeekyPlays> Go find the pussy vat

[0:53:20] <+Theora_Jones> I don't think anyone is willing to claim ownership of this shit
[0:53:22] <+cvp5127> who named the forest?
[0:53:23] <+Jessie_Lockhart> Its a review show

[0:55:29] <+SvenHolgersson> Kevin has a toxic homelife
[0:55:38] <+Theora_Jones> Kevin has no friends IRL
[0:55:46] <IndoorSitup> Have they talked about N's age yet?
[0:56:00] <codiekitty> There's an episode where he goes home, but then has to come back, Flatbush Koopa style.
[0:56:10] <+tigerfang86> or else I'm gonna have to MOW MY LAWN
[0:56:10] <ScreamLord> Wah Wah
[0:56:11] <+Jessie_Lockhart> They sort of address that in a later episode where his classmates show up in Videoland
[0:56:11] <+SolidusRex> Mother Brain's going to cum?
[0:56:13] <honeyman18> Kevin comes back into the wasteland of the apocalypse
[0:56:15] <FockHead> Help out or you're cleaning Mother Brain's room, boyo
[0:56:23] <+Jessie_Lockhart> There‚Äôs no mention that he‚Äôs been gone for any stretch of time
[0:56:31] <+BinaryFireball> is kevin a majestic bird who can fly?
[0:56:42] <+LiquidDinosaur> What if he's also IRL like in Garzy's Wing
[0:57:00] <+alcoholoch> lana runs a britain style empire where all her holdings are far away from whatever rinky dink castle she lives in
[0:57:20] <+Jessie_Lockhart> Yeah wheres my Toy Story 3 ending for Captain N?
[0:57:34] <+Theora_Jones> Kevin is holding back the harsh truth that if he doesn't hold in the reset button while turning the power off, their save game is toast.
[0:57:43] <+Jessie_Lockhart> There are towns people in Zelda for example
[0:58:03] <%noahammerman> indiana jones I guess
[0:58:12] <+alcoholoch> theres that one in starfox adventures?
[0:58:14] <+SvenHolgersson> I WANT A NEW CAPTAIN N

[0:58:20] <derekwst3> castlevania 2 had invisible floors i think
[0:58:22] <FockHead> I don't remember any invisible bridges in Castlevania
[0:58:28] <FockHead> That's more a Mega Man style trick
[0:58:33] <+Jessie_Lockhart> There is a fair amount of invisible stuff in games for a long time
[0:58:42] <+MrSargent90> I think castlevania 1 had an invisible platform on the final screen before going to fight dracula
[0:58:44] <+LiquidDinosaur> oh my god this is the kid from the This is Sparta remix
[0:58:47] <+MrSargent90> where you get lots of hearts
[0:58:53] <+SvenHolgersson> WHY DOES ICARUS HAVE EYELINER

[1:06:21] <+tigerfang86> Cow
[1:06:22] <honeyman18> Just ices megaman in cold blood
[1:06:23] <FockHead> Because why not?
[1:06:29] <The_Dark_Gods> The 'mock the starving' arrow
[1:06:31] <+SvenHolgersson> DOES HE LIVE IN THE ARROW
[1:06:33] <+Theora_Jones> That cow has clearly come into contact with Simon Belmont
[1:06:34] <+LiquidDinosaur> skinny but giant tits
[1:06:35] <+SvenHolgersson> THIS IS SCARY
[1:06:40] <+LiquidDinosaur> this is like anime proportions
[1:06:46] <+inktoxicant> WHY IS THIS COW
[1:06:47] <honeyman18> That cow is just dying of famine
[1:06:52] <+alcoholoch> man how fucked would this show had gotten if they had a pokemon episode
[1:06:53] <+Jessie_Lockhart> So the cow is extremely malnourished YET its utter is full?!
[1:06:55] <+LiquidDinosaur> Anorexic Cow
[1:06:57] <+tigerfang86> well
[1:06:58] <+BinaryFireball> reminds me of old disney cartoons
[1:06:59] <+tigerfang86> they're not wrong
[1:07:25] <SGrim> The phrase big tiddy anime cow has made Pat uncomfortable. Note this.
[1:07:29] <+Theora_Jones> Cow Fighter 2020
[1:07:38] <derekwst3> cow nintendo's most famous character
[1:07:42] <+Jessie_Lockhart> These are midwestern animators. They love their cows. Kappa
[1:07:45] <+LiquidDinosaur> @SGrim we must use this against him in the future
[1:07:51] <+NitronStreams> every one always asks why cow, but no one asks "how cow?"
[1:07:56] <+Theora_Jones> Give us Cow in Smash, you Nintendo cowards!
[1:08:06] <+LiquidDinosaur> @NitronStreams PRETTY GOOD, IT DOESNT SEEM
[1:08:07] <+BinaryFireball> do cows have horns? I though that was only bulls for some reason
[1:08:18] <+Jessie_Lockhart> It is only bulls
[1:08:28] <derekwst3> what you buyn
[1:08:32] <+Theora_Jones> This bovine has left us with more questions than answers.
[1:08:33] <+BinaryFireball> ok good I'm not crazy
[1:08:41] <+LiquidDinosaur> a spool
[1:08:44] <+dmtjinni> angriest pat
[1:08:45] <+Jessie_Lockhart> Also voiced by Steve Buscemi
[1:08:53] <honeyman18> Which bullet is healing, let me just shoot you till i find it!
[1:08:57] <+LiquidDinosaur> WHAT IS WRONG WITH MEGAMAN
[1:09:00] <+LiquidDinosaur> WHY IS MEGAMAN A WEIRD BABY
[1:09:01] <+BinaryFireball> that's weed.... the man was making a peperroni pizza arrow
[1:09:06] <derekwst3> cow pokemon
[1:09:09] <+SvenHolgersson> WHY WOULD YOU MAKE THESE ARROWS
[1:09:13] <+Jessie_Lockhart> @liquiddinosaur dont worry about it
[1:09:13] <FockHead> @LiquidDinosaur That's how DiC do
[1:09:20] <+NeonLight> Wait, being shot with an arrow doesnt make you angry by default?
[1:09:41] <+tigerfang86> that's never happened before
[1:09:43] <+tigerfang86> never
[1:09:43] <+Jessie_Lockhart> DiC is terrible. They only got so much work bc they were cheap.
[1:09:46] <+Theora_Jones> There are only two options when being shot with an arrow: anger, or horny for brain
[1:09:47] <derekwst3> no way...
[1:09:47] <+SvenHolgersson> Yea cuz NO ONE gets mad at your significant other
[1:09:49] <+NitronStreams> Yeah Pat
[1:09:49] <+SvenHolgersson> NEVER
[1:09:57] <CzeekyPlays> JUST EAT THE SANDWICH
[1:09:58] <morningmoondude> let her eat the ham, pat
[1:10:16] <+LiquidDinosaur> Cold frigid passionless marriage
[1:10:30] <+OwlLightningMage> Pat was really mad when Paige beat him in Mario Kart
[1:10:32] <+Theora_Jones> Don't threaten me with a good time
[1:10:50] <morningmoondude> oh yeah, forgot about Paige beating Pat at mario kart 8
[1:10:52] <Arazien> Let Launchpad McBelmont fuck the brain
[1:10:57] <codiekitty> And maybe if Mother Brain gets some action she'll stop caring about taking over Videoland.
[1:10:57] <+Jessie_Lockhart> Cold flacid marriage
[1:11:00] <Tytangamer> Now we need an edit of them at the altar with Simon being Paige and motherbrain is Pat.
[1:11:05] <+NeonLight> Simon did it to himself, in the process of almost doing the same thing to mother brain
[1:11:10] <sileo_patronus> Love is just chemicals anyway
[1:11:26] <+NitronStreams> ^beat me to it
[1:11:28] <+Theora_Jones> In this case, LSD
[1:11:31] <+LiquidDinosaur> I WANT AN ALIEN SOLDIER CARTOON
[1:11:34] <zk_nails> how I met your Mother Brain
[1:11:44] <+Jessie_Lockhart> Woolie: ‚Äúits all chemicals, it doesnt matter‚Äù
[1:12:02] <+dmtjinni> this pad dude is cool i like him
[1:12:05] <+dmtjinni> pat*
[1:12:06] <+tigerfang86> HELL YEAH
[1:12:08] <IndoorSitup> Audio was in one ear for a second
[1:12:08] <+Theora_Jones> "The sweet release of death!"
[1:12:09] <TomCrimson> ITS HAPPENING
[1:12:13] <+cvp5127> PogChamp
[1:12:13] <+DJ_Androm3da_OFFICIAL> At that moment Duke knew he fucked up
[1:12:14] <honeyman18> R E L E A S E M E
[1:12:19] <theleggedone> PogChamp
[1:12:20] <+LiquidDinosaur> @dmtjinni Pat is incredibly cool psaDab
[1:12:41] <JackofKnights> does Simon call MB "mommy" while they fuck?
[1:12:46] <+Jessie_Lockhart> Duke is an adrenaline
[1:13:10] <+DJ_Androm3da_OFFICIAL> He grabbed her panties
[1:13:14] <+Jessie_Lockhart> Captain Lana
[1:13:20] <+SvenHolgersson> Lana making me act up
[1:13:33] <majindusto> FREEDOM!!!!!
[1:13:36] <ElkRiverDog> Hit the ground hard thot
[1:13:37] <+abrupt_abe> Wait when did he get his gun back?
[1:13:55] <+Jessie_Lockhart> Dont worry about it
[1:14:03] <derekwst3> the princess grabbed it when she was thrown in the hole
[1:14:11] <ammobasket> "You're all probably wondering how I got into this kooky situation!"
[1:14:15] <+Jessie_Lockhart> That is this show‚Äôs logic ‚Äúdont worry about it‚Äù
[1:14:17] <+NitronStreams> were they thrown in the same hole as the gun?
[1:14:24] <+Jessie_Lockhart> Yes
[1:14:38] <+philjamesson> also paused using Select. uncommon.
[1:14:42] <FockHead> That doesn't seem fair
[1:14:43] <+alcoholoch> its so unsportsmanlike
[1:14:50] <majindusto> G U N
[1:14:51] <derekwst3> gun is strongest character
[1:15:03] <+Theora_Jones> To be fair, you can successfully fight most people with a gun.
[1:15:17] <Tytangamer> I‚Äôm gonna use my first bunch of points to say there was a Starship Troopers cartoon made in Canada.
[1:15:18] <sileo_patronus> That's why I like Digimon: Data Squad because the protagonist just fistfights them.
[1:15:24] <The_Dark_Gods> It'll be just as lucid as the Mike Tyson show
[1:15:52] <+Theora_Jones> Fucking cow squirt again. Thanks.
[1:16:08] <Pookiedaexzile> l
[1:16:25] <reonome> shhh its magic
[1:16:25] <ammobasket> pause-buffer to save the day
[1:16:35] <+alcoholoch> how were his clothes blowing in the wind when he paused reality?
[1:16:57] <+SvenHolgersson> This is some Zach Hadel shit
[1:16:59] <+Jessie_Lockhart> He‚Äôs a seahorse man
[1:17:01] <derekwst3> seahorse man
[1:17:01] <Pookiedaexzile> "writer"

[1:17:09] <Pookiedaexzile> like the artist didn't pull that out his ass
[1:17:10] <+alcoholoch> he looks like he's super into this union
[1:17:14] <FockHead> Slogra?
[1:17:15] <+Jessie_Lockhart> Slogra?
[1:17:15] <reonome> he's a furry into bdsm
[1:17:23] <ch1nesegooseberry> Slogra didn't show up until IV
[1:17:26] <+Jessie_Lockhart> Bloodlines
[1:17:32] <Feragorn> that's a hork bajir
[1:17:35] <codiekitty> Pretty sure that belt is a bridle.
[1:17:36] <FockHead> That's SotN, MAYBE Dracula X. Both exist after Captain N
[1:17:45] <derekwst3> the pig could of been a link monster?
[1:17:55] <+Jessie_Lockhart> The one with Richter was his first appearance
[1:18:02] <morningmoondude> he has a tie
[1:18:17] <+LiquidDinosaur> HE'S THE WORST MONSTER OF ALL
[1:18:22] <+Jessie_Lockhart> Also that belt is not effective that high up. Its a fashion statement
[1:18:32] <FockHead> Maybe he's a Homunculus. Or a Frankenstein with lots of makeup
[1:18:36] <Shwepie> Why is Paige at the wedding?
[1:19:28] <0rond> wow
[1:19:32] <+SvenHolgersson> CAPTAIN N SHOULD SUE

[1:23:27] <theleggedone> You could just plagiarize this an call it a harddrive article
[1:23:31] <+SvenHolgersson> IS IT A BIT
[1:23:31] <+DJ_Androm3da_OFFICIAL> Thats the best headline ive ever seen LUL
[1:23:49] <FockHead> Honestly I can't even tell anymore
[1:23:52] <+LiquidDinosaur> "gentrification has finally come to williamsberg" IN TWENTY NINETEEN? UH BROOO?!?!?!
[1:23:58] <LeftOverPizza13> FINALLY
[1:24:01] <+LiquidDinosaur> SEVENTEEN*
[1:24:03] <0rond> the best satire is that when you can't tell it's satire from the title
[1:24:09] <+LiquidDinosaur> THAT HAS TO BE SATIRE. IT HAS TO BE.
[1:24:11] <paintedroes> the trump thing makes it feel like a bit

[1:27:29] <ammobasket> must be a rights dispute
[1:27:31] <theleggedone> It is like drawing a penis on the Mona Lisa
[1:28:29] <MrUnimportant> Hardpore Cornography
[1:28:31] <+templar010> But what does hardcore mean
[1:28:41] <+NitronStreams> hardpore cornography
[1:28:41] <sileo_patronus> Hardpore Cornography indeed
[1:28:58] <codiekitty> "Hard Corps" was the Genesis Contra game.
[1:29:18] <+tigerfang86> HELL YEAH
[1:29:21] <0rond> that guy was the best
[1:29:23] <+tigerfang86> respect the hustle
[1:29:25] <0rond> the strongest hustle
[1:29:28] <+alcoholoch> respect the hustle
[1:29:34] <honeyman18> A sacrifice was made
[1:29:37] <+philjamesson> but you get to be the guy
[1:29:39] <Pookiedaexzile> What was that game that was song unpopular people played full on porn
[1:29:44] <Pookiedaexzile> in stream
[1:29:50] <+LiquidDinosaur> Justin.tv
[1:30:05] <+Mr_y1096> yeyeye
[1:30:13] <+tigerfang86> @Pookiedaexzile Artifact, the bad Valve card game i think
[1:30:14] <0rond> you know the twitch admins fucking lost it watching that guy
[1:30:23] <+Totally_Not_Toby> this is transformative, right?
[1:30:37] <+mMayrro> just pretend chat are voices in your head
[1:30:38] <that_guy_from_high_school> No negg us forever
[1:30:47] <Pookiedaexzile> The universe speaks

[1:31:00] <ammobasket> I hear EVERYONE likes this one
[1:31:03] <FockHead> Nooo you can't acknowledge the chat, then it can constitute as fair use!
[1:31:04] <+Theora_Jones> It's a group collaboration to make sure the very important Captain N wiki is as accurate as possible.
[1:31:23] <FockHead> I love Dracula's Noveau Riche look
[1:31:31] <+BinaryFireball> Man ends his parasocial relationship but is unable to find closure
[1:31:34] <+Theora_Jones> Dracula has persistent "I smelled the rankest fart" face
[1:31:35] <0rond> king hippo cleans up nice
[1:31:51] <+BizarroDF> king hippo is DTF
[1:31:52] <Pookiedaexzile> It was animated in the 80s
[1:31:56] <Pookiedaexzile> shit takes forever
[1:31:59] <+secretspud> The implication that King Hippo has just fucked the shit out of Mother Brain is destroying me.
[1:32:09] <+BizarroDF> king hippo's prostate has a lil bandaid on it
[1:32:16] <Pookiedaexzile> Where do you put your dick in that
[1:32:24] <derekwst3> black faced ghost
[1:32:28] <0rond> baphpmet from some castlevania prolly
[1:32:38] <codiekitty> King Hippo's suit looks like a banana peel.
[1:32:40] <morningmoondude> DARK MOOMIN
[1:32:46] <+LiquidDinosaur> Violent Moomin
[1:32:56] <+secretspud> King Hippo versus a normal dog FIGHT!
[1:32:59] <+BizarroDF> king hippo's suit might be one of those suits they bury people in which is why theres no back
[1:33:15] <+Theora_Jones> King Hippo's jacket is split up the back because he stole it from a corpse.
[1:33:16] <+abrupt_abe> He totally had the gun when they fell off the bridge
[1:33:19] <+Mekhet09> That's his new suit Pat you were wrong.
[1:33:22] <FockHead> I love the color of the shirt around Hippo's neck goes NUTS. Nice quality, DIC
[1:33:29] <Pookiedaexzile> Mother Brain gotta give ridiculous toppy wit dem lips son

[1:34:13] <+OfficioPrefectusCorgi> Kevin has the gun
[1:34:14] <+LiquidDinosaur> @Pookiedaexzile I've heard the phrase "getting some brain" but this is just silly

[1:35:23] <+BizarroDF> why cant megaman just absorb the antidote arrow and then fire a hundred of em using his mega ammo
[1:35:26] <SGrim> Why does megaman have a clock on his wrist? Wouldn't the time simply feed into his brain? BrainSlug
[1:35:28] <+BizarroDF> hope someone got fired for that one
[1:36:07] <+secretspud> There, the Count lays until 1999

[1:36:21] <+philjamesson> his gun is the monster from It
[1:36:24] <FockHead> It's a temporal gun linked to if Simon Belmont gets married or not. That's the only explaination
[1:36:59] <Naho_Saenoki> They were thrown into the same hole as the gun.
[1:37:08] <+LiquidDinosaur> Wait is that Castlevania Dracula? which Dracula is that

[1:37:57] <theleggedone> Dr wahwee
[1:37:58] <Thalchampz> it should've been Medusa
[1:38:06] <morningmoondude> Eggplant Wizard is kinda high level, but when they made a new Kid Icarus they made a better one with Tempura
[1:38:07] <+Theora_Jones> "backstory" and "character"
[1:38:13] <+tigerfang86> LMAO
[1:38:20] <+philjamesson> hahahaha
[1:38:30] <The_Dark_Gods> Cyberpunk terrorist, animal-man who knows boxing, and some random wizard mook
[1:38:35] <codiekitty> Eggplant Wizard was an enemy that showed up in some levels and threw eggplants around, and if you touched one it'd seal all your abilities and you had to backtrack to a nurse.
[1:38:47] <honeyman18> find yo self an eggplant wizard daddy in your life
[1:38:55] <0rond> eggplant wizard is my waifu

[1:45:06] <FockHead> I kinda love it. Simon is that right blend of scampish and annoying
[1:45:16] <AncelDeLambert> he's just Johnny Bravo
[1:45:24] <SatoruMasamune> Simon looks like a fucking World War 1 combat pilot. What the fuck does that have to do with fighting Dracula?
[1:45:32] <honeyman18> All of them wanna know who wrote this shit
[1:45:35] <AncelDeLambert> but not as cool as Johnny Bravo because Johnny has sweet shades
[1:45:38] <+Theora_Jones> Duke's inner monologue is just "The Sound of Silence" on repeat
[1:46:29] <AncelDeLambert> just Kenny it
[1:46:35] <FockHead> Same with Sealab. No continuity is a fun way to go at it
[1:46:36] <Mothman742> Space dandy is amazing
[1:46:56] <+Theora_Jones> The elderlies talking about "Get a Life"
[1:47:07] <+SvenHolgersson> THATS GREAT
[1:47:07] <Shwepie> Them dying in the first episode did happen though. Almost ever episode is a different multiverse pair.

[1:47:41] <+SvenHolgersson> CRUBMLES TO DUST
[1:47:48] <honeyman18> advertise ball cremes
[1:47:55] <jdllama> I can attest to that
[1:48:00] <FockHead> And then you turn into Tom Green, and you completely disappear
[1:48:01] <AncelDeLambert> it's the CIIIIIIIIRCLE of JEEEEEEFFFFF!
[1:48:03] <Zetheos> Millennials are now old enough to be called boomer : (
[1:48:04] <+mMayrro> JeffStaresAt

[1:48:10] <AncelDeLambert> and it moves us aaaaaaaaaallllll!
[1:48:42] <MelBrooksKA> So whose the guy that's in the tbfp subreddit?
[1:48:42] <paintedroes> 7/10, MVP is Duke for sure
[1:48:47] <ch1nesegooseberry> 6/10, MVP: the cow
[1:48:48] <+DJ_Androm3da_OFFICIAL> 6/10
[1:48:49] <Zetheos> 5/7
[1:48:51] <+SvenHolgersson> Kid Icarus for sure
[1:48:52] <+DJ_Androm3da_OFFICIAL> My MVP is Mr Bones
[1:48:52] <morningmoondude> 6/10
[1:48:53] <AncelDeLambert> I give this a Suckicus out of ten
[1:48:55] <+SvenHolgersson> He does all the work
[1:48:55] <FockHead> Simon is MVP for self-love
[1:48:56] <jdllama> 8/10, MVP is Count Sleeve Chomper
[1:48:58] <codiekitty> MVP was the cow, she didn't ask to be in this.
[1:49:02] <Naho_Saenoki> Simon for MVP
[1:49:08] <jdllama> Ooooh shit yeah MVP is the arrow creator
[1:49:09] <+Theora_Jones> Duke is the MVP for his longing for sweet release
[1:49:12] <morningmoondude> Moomin in a black coat for MVP
[1:49:19] <+JD_Lars> 6. MVP is King Hippo‚Äôs suit
[1:49:19] <AncientToco> 7/10 MVP jar babies
[1:49:25] <+philjamesson> mvp is the guy who made the cow arrow
[1:49:42] <CanadianAnimatorGuy> Bat Count
[1:49:47] <+inktoxicant> mister booooones
[1:49:50] <MrUnimportant> Yeah, MVP Mr. Bones. He was a wild ride.
[1:50:04] <+NitronStreams> Mr. Bones has strong branding
[1:50:10] <+LiquidDinosaur> He's just Papyrus
[1:50:27] <%im____joe> I missed a big chunk of the podcast and everybody is saying the cow and I have no idea what's happening
[1:50:29] <+SvenHolgersson> Easy 10 if they actually got married
[1:51:01] <+Valentttine> paige will be mad if you don't pick mr bones
[1:51:10] <+Theora_Jones> Most importantly, Duke longs for the void
[1:51:27] <+inktoxicant> Mister Bones also breathes fire
[1:51:27] <+philjamesson> easy to explain joe. kid icarus visited an arrow craftsman who shot an arrow whose sole purpose was to spawn a scrawny, malnourished cow
[1:51:37] <+Theora_Jones> Duke would shoot a man in the dick.
[1:51:48] <IndoorSitup> B O O M E R
[1:52:07] <FockHead> Why can't they go into something weird, like Cheetahmen
[1:52:21] <codiekitty> It's about a shrieking baby dragon.
[1:52:21] <FockHead> It's got the DragoLord in name only
[1:52:24] <CanadianAnimatorGuy> BABY DWAGON
[1:52:25] <+Theora_Jones> Isn't there one where they do Faxanadu? Like, they couldn't get Zelda, so close enough?
[1:52:49] <codiekitty> They do Faxanadu, but they also do Zelda twice.
[1:52:51] <+Peachylana> Zelda is season 2
[1:53:13] <+Theora_Jones> I blocked out everything after season 1 due to Game Boy being terrifying.
[1:53:23] <AncelDeLambert> it's not surprising that the background art they went back to the most was also the most generic, because it means they could spend more on drawing them, since other shows could use it too
[1:53:46] <+rumtumtugnutz> I remember Pro Stars because of a Hair Jordan joke
[1:53:49] <+LiquidDinosaur> NUT
[1:54:03] <AncelDeLambert> FUCKING MICHEAL JACKSON
