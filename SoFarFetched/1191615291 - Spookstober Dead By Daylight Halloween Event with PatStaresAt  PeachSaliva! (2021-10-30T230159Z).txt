[1:17:45] <Agami23> my favorite one of those is people making average human proportioned pat using his head

[1:40:43] <@Jekado> fuck... i hate when i accidently did that
[1:40:55] <JoshManVGH> Yes...
[1:40:56] <@Jekado> wear a blue shirt with kakis at best buy
[1:40:58] <Ranryu692> that's great
[1:41:03] <@Jekado> or red shirt at target...
[1:41:16] <Ranryu692> wow
[1:41:54] <@Jekado> there were times someone would ask me a question at best buy and if i knew it would just answer it anyways.
[1:42:04] <JoshManVGH> I used to wear button ups and ties to work. Got stopped in a grocery story one cause someone thought I was a manager. I'm... unclear what energy I was putting out.
[1:42:04] <Sotetsu> Red shirts are always the first to go.
[1:42:09] <ElkRiverDog> Anything vaguely resembling a red shirt at target.  Seriously, wore a sienna tank top one time
[1:43:06] <Sotetsu> Karen's are like  bulls. They
[1:43:16] <Sotetsu> can only see red
[1:43:25] <JoshManVGH> Hooray!
[1:43:27] <Sotetsu> wtg, Pat.
[1:43:44] <ElkRiverDog> @Sotetsu Truth
[1:43:54] <JoshManVGH> You still have Infurate? I thought that became Inner Release
[1:43:59] <%Ranryu692> Ranryu692 subscribed at Tier 1. 
[1:44:43] <Sotetsu> Pat makes me want to play FF 14
[1:44:55] <JoshManVGH> Damn it, I don't know my buttons!
[1:45:00] <%Ranryu692> I ran into Zangief in the roulette the other night psaDogchamp
[1:45:44] <Sotetsu> sipsipRude
[1:46:33] <Sotetsu> I thought Pat stopped playing DBD because of NFTs, so this is a nice surprise.
[1:46:40] <@Jekado> fetch just gets her servant to get her food or snacks.... geefBlinds wait... THATS ME sofarfBirb
[1:46:51] <JoshManVGH> Work Related Calorie Expense
[1:47:19] <Sotetsu> McDonald's increased prices in the US.
[1:48:30] <Sotetsu> I'm weak, too. Hopefully there are no more nfts
[1:49:42] <JoshManVGH> The louder you are the more Investors are likely to hear about it!
[1:49:51] <Sotetsu> I'm really good at complaining fmgNICE
[1:50:02] <%Ranryu692> that's good,  because I have a lot more voice than I have dollar
[1:50:38] <Puhff> Exactly. Everybody going on about why I bitched about Chappelle and it's lke, my bitching is the only power I have in the capitalist hellworld
[1:51:01] <%Ranryu692> as long as it isn't RE5 Jill
[1:51:33] <JoshManVGH> Eat the Rich? Naw man, ANNOY the Rich! It's way more satisfying!
[1:51:40] <@Jekado> When are we getting Jill from "Welcome to Raccoon city" costume?
[1:51:52] <+Dirty_Dandere> RE5 Jill with the Cap was nice
[1:52:06] <Sotetsu> I love how boons made Plague super viable.
[1:53:04] <JoshManVGH> @jekado I would give money RIGHT NOW if there was a game with Hannah John-Kamen in it!
[1:53:18] <Sotetsu> Because healing with a boon totem is very easy, and Plague infection doesn't let you heal, Plague is a lot more appealing
[1:54:20] <+Malikial> pukified seems way worse than being jokerfied
[1:54:53] <Puhff> the irony
[1:55:00] <+Malikial> maybe I just hate the puking.
[1:55:35] <Sotetsu> There is also something very satisfying about puking on survivors. fmgS
[1:56:12] <JoshManVGH> @malikial That's totally fair. You would see a lot more heroes and civic action if there was a dude running around Gothem with Upchuck Gas.
[1:57:32] <Sotetsu> On the reverse side, killers that are good at just injuring and not downing (like my girl Legion) are a lot weaker with boon totems.
[1:57:40] <JoshManVGH> Pants Shitting Gas seems like it would be labeled a war crime
[1:58:54] <Sotetsu> Ruuuuun, Paige! sipsipSipsipblind
[2:00:03] <Sotetsu> LUL
[2:00:14] <+Dirty_Dandere> LUL LUL LUL

[2:02:11] <JoshManVGH> Weird shit out there now. I lost it earlier at an ad for Pedialite Sport. Fucking imagining some macho sports guy knocking back Pedialite on the sidelines

[2:04:34] <Puhff> I agree, PlgueofGripes also freaks me out
[2:04:48] <Sotetsu> I hear you, Paige. I need a ton of sleep. It sucks.
[2:05:48] <JoshManVGH> I've found as I get older, the less consistent I am with my sleep schedule, the more sleep I need.
[2:06:03] <Sotetsu> Um, do you play with silent viewers, Fetched? tangBless
[2:06:48] <Sotetsu> Woo, 30+ represent!

[2:08:42] <@Jekado> made of glass... but also super strong
[2:08:48] <@Jekado> paige is basically a glass cannon
[2:09:16] <Sotetsu> Just live in your own filth and stream.
[2:09:29] <Puhff> Would it not help with an 8 hour stream to give yourself breaks and lunch like an actual job?
[2:09:33] <Puhff> or no??
[2:10:01] <Sotetsu> People tend to leave during breaks, so that can be hard for newer streamers.
[2:10:16] <JoshManVGH> If tomorrows game is compelling that may push the will to stream!
[2:11:18] <Sotetsu> Pat, you are a word crafter.
[2:11:19] <Puhff> @Sotetsu true but the way Twitch works, if you're new and streaming for that long, you better be streaming something hugely popular
[2:11:39] <Sotetsu> @puhff Yeah, that is rough.
[2:12:10] <Sotetsu> fmgS
[2:12:40] <@Jekado> stream Front Mission Gunhazzard!
[2:12:41] <Puhff> :O
[2:12:51] <Sotetsu> I was gonna suggest my friend play DBD. Is that a bad call for a small streamer?
[2:12:54] <+Vextalyst> Can confirm this is true
[2:13:05] <JoshManVGH> How do you do that without getting labeled "The Rocket Night adventures streamer"â€½
[2:13:24] <Sotetsu> When is the next Sonic Highschool reading?
[2:14:19] <Sotetsu> Does your boon go away if you die?

[2:23:56] <Sotetsu> No worries, I know that can be risky.
[2:24:23] <JoshManVGH> Is this a happy Vault Dweller killer?
[2:25:14] <JoshManVGH> It's content!
[2:26:19] <TautestCrane1> I was surprised by how many viewers you had Fetched, then I remembered that it was the co-stream day
[2:27:15] <Agami23> do pumpkins just give some bloodpoints?
[2:27:29] <Sotetsu> Nice mindgame!
[2:28:02] <Agami23> articulation of facts?

[3:12:30] <JoshManVGH> That was a nice thing to do!
[3:12:41] <@Jekado> people do get pretty spicy when playing

[3:16:08] <JoshManVGH> It's fun to watch. I have no patients to play it so this is great
[3:16:59] <Sotetsu> Just did a Pig game. No one tried to boop me.
[3:17:07] <JoshManVGH> Oh my god! Ghost Face does the frigging "I'm gonna getcha!" run!

[3:44:09] <@Jekado> do you want soda?
[3:45:05] <Sotetsu> Smooth jazz Nemesis
[3:45:35] <JoshManVGH> Is it weird that I'm getting Delilah After Dark vibes from this stream?
[3:46:30] <%bevyrage> she just wanted to hang out with the glow sticks
[3:47:13] <@Jekado> zombo value
[3:48:41] <JoshManVGH> I remeber the entire Delilah show being audio ambian. And forwhatever reason if we had to take a long drive home from visiting family, my mother would not allow anything else on the radio.
[3:51:11] <@Jekado> they made this map to well...
[3:51:58] <Sotetsu> It's frustrating seeing a gen aura and not knowing how to get there.
[3:52:06] <@Jekado> some say there are people still playing this map to this day...
[3:52:14] <Sotetsu> @jekado LUL
[3:52:53] <JoshManVGH> What a dick move!
[3:52:55] <@Jekado> PUNCH her in there
[3:53:17] <JoshManVGH> Yeah? Yeah! Yeah? Yeah! Yeah! NOPE!
[3:56:50] <@Jekado> They should make a wrestler Killer and his weapon is just a chair.
[3:58:02] <@Jekado> guess they took a... U-y... gSmug
[3:58:21] <@Jekado> U-y can mean U Turn here!
[3:58:31] <JoshManVGH> @jekado Can the Chair Killer have and Aerith skin,
[3:58:34] <JoshManVGH> ?
[3:59:05] <Sotetsu> What about a Me-y?
[3:59:15] <@Jekado> @JoshManVGH that would be kinda dope
[4:00:21] <@Jekado> tho a big female wrestler type feels harder to run... AWAY... from
[4:00:46] <JoshManVGH> Be like living that one Lady D comic
[4:01:01] <JoshManVGH> "Noooo don't caaaatch me!"
[4:01:34] <@Jekado> pretty much i'm thinking Nui from Dorororo just chasing you with a chair.
[4:02:33] <JoshManVGH> YEEEES! Big fucking leaping slam with the chair.
[4:02:58] <JoshManVGH> They carry to the hook is a Backbreaker
[4:03:47] <@Jekado> if the mori is just like a power bomb into a grave would be kinda cool
[4:04:32] <@Jekado> powerbomb but like in a friendly way...
[4:05:14] <JoshManVGH> Uses like a shadow spike from the Entity to climb on and get into position.
[4:07:26] <JoshManVGH> Honestly, Shin and Noi would fit right in with the killers in their own right.
[4:11:14] <@Jekado> yes spirit halloween store the ghost that haunts dead businesses.
[4:12:39] <@Jekado> yeah the one i worked at...
[4:12:54] <@Jekado> Fry's was a zombie of a store near the end anyways
[4:24:54] <@Jekado> to many people is why
[4:27:49] <JoshManVGH> Whaaaaat the fuck it that!?

[4:52:29] <+Malikial> 8 hours, that's a workday!
[4:53:43] <+Malikial> I've never played this before but I like watching people get harassed by the bad man/woman.
[4:54:36] <+Malikial> Just one crumb of totem please.
[4:55:19] <+Malikial> That heal animation you just rubbed her butt.
[4:55:36] <@Jekado> oh no Korean Majima

[4:57:07] <+Malikial> That claw thing looks rough.
[4:59:06] <+Malikial> I like that this game is just about getting the fuck away from him.
[4:59:14] <+Malikial> Not unlocking a shotgun and taking him down.
[5:01:15] <+Malikial> This angry kpop man is annoying.
[5:01:56] <+Malikial> I can't believe you're leveling up past 69.
[5:02:45] <+Malikial> Can you get to 420?
[5:04:06] <+Malikial> Alright I'm gonna go cook my food, I might be back soon. Like this though.

[5:25:44] <~SoFarFetched> !ads
[5:25:44] <@Nightbot> Ads will be played during loading screens or downtime during game-plays. This prevents pre-rolls & helps support the channel. Thanks for being understanding!
[5:26:33] <JoshManVGH> Ad threat primed, game secured
[5:27:10] <JoshManVGH> Twas Twitch delayed the matchmaking!
[5:27:53] <JoshManVGH> It's creepy enough to be real, DBD could use AWS.
[5:29:41] <+king_wragles> king_wragles subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 3 months! haha, resub time
[5:32:11] <JoshManVGH> Whaaaat was that!
[5:41:03] <+king_wragles> Calm Spirit now delays screms?
[5:42:11] <+king_wragles> So your Birb moves their mouth and it's synced
[5:42:58] <@Jekado> HE'S TURNING US INTO MONSTERS!

[5:46:07] <ShockzNDrawe> Still going huh?
[5:46:11] <+king_wragles> No like, I thought it didn't say it on the description
[5:46:13] <+Lord_Rockman> followed
[5:46:20] <ShockzNDrawe> cool
[5:46:34] <ShockzNDrawe> how've the games been
[5:48:19] <+king_wragles> Well, it's bed oclock
[5:48:24] <ShockzNDrawe> I always found it interesting that it's 1st pewrson for killer but 3rd person for survivors. guess it makes sense because killer is combat based while survivor is task based and the zoomed out camera makes it easier to watch your surroundings
[5:48:25] <+king_wragles> gl hf, thanks for stream
[5:48:36] <@Jekado> wow i never realize how slow that axe startup is
[6:00:55] <@Jekado> yeah i feel bad because they were expecting a save

[7:27:18] <@Jekado> ironically not really a pin ball champ
[7:29:30] <@Jekado> the weirdest is blight doesn't scare me as much as him throwing used syringes on the ground.
[7:29:43] <@Jekado> geefSusp
[7:30:08] <%Ranryu692> horrifying
[7:30:51] <@Jekado> like geef says your team is only as good as the weakest link and sometimes its easy to find the weakest link
