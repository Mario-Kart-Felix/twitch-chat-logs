[0:21:22] <TokkanAU> @carrotc I wasn't thinking DPs, I was thinking Gran = rushdown and Katalina = spacing
[0:21:24] <carrotc> Because they ain't got their hands on the new build

[0:29:57] <Triplicat> "just block dude it's not that hard"
[0:29:58] <+zaledoria> Lowain is amazing and opened up Anime NYC
[0:29:58] <furix> did they fix the whole blocking cross ups by holding the block button?
[0:30:02] <+DoubleDaze> lowain bros are frat guys i love them
[0:30:03] <Frazaell> Lowain bros can summon Yugu
[0:30:05] <Richtofen2003> Lowain gang
[0:30:21] <julzbeingjulz> Literal surfer dudes
[0:30:25] <+DanUgore> Isnt that the point of buttons to block furix?
[0:30:29] <sorridsnake12> @furix we wouldn't know cause they refuse to show anything new
[0:30:32] <+AngelDS_150> I need to see human piramid attack in action
[0:30:33] <+DoubleDaze> do i grind gw or do i grind mats for song cirThink
[0:30:37] <shltthedd> 50/50 mix "sup fam you good"
[0:30:38] <+TeeJayVA> @furix you couldn't throw tech or something like that. There was a drawback to using it
[0:30:40] <furix> naw they had said they were gonna fix that
[0:30:58] <+AngelDS_150> who needs to block?
[0:30:59] <schwis_orifice> wait there's a block button?
[0:31:01] <furix> apperently blocking cross ups with blocks was a glitch or something they were planning on fixing? Or so I heard
[0:31:03] <+zaledoria> @DoubleDaze is your dark good and did you do minimum if you have any?
[0:31:14] <+TeeJayVA> could be.
[0:31:15] <furix> with block button*
[0:31:19] <+MacaroniTurtle> There's a block button and traditional block
[0:31:24] <Triplicat> if you're holding the block button and get thrown you are forced to late tech and you take damage
[0:31:28] <DanaCWSF> @DoubleDaze follow your heart and slack at gw
[0:31:32] <Triplicat> I do not remember if this can kill you
[0:31:32] <+DoubleDaze> @zaledoria i hit my quota and we're winning rn lmao
[0:31:33] <+MaelstromFC> PokCroagunk
[0:31:34] <furix> block button also feels a bit slow? from what i remember in the beta
[0:31:43] <+MacaroniTurtle> But nip rush
[0:31:44] <schwis_orifice> plus 2343245236
[0:31:44] <+zaledoria> Then farm mats for song for next gw
[0:31:44] <Frazaell> I've heard that you can't tech throws if you're holding the block Button
[0:31:47] <+DoubleDaze> slacc c tier cirComfy
[0:31:47] <+DanUgore> looks slow af
[0:31:53] <+P_Rock_Brown> char look sick
[0:31:55] <Joey_JoestarXD> there's nothing to "fix" with the block button blocking crossups, that's how it's supposed to work.
[0:31:57] <+TeeJayVA> I think it's suppose to be a crutch for new players but not abusing.
[0:32:09] <+TeeJayVA> abusable*
[0:32:21] <DanaCWSF> PokScizor
[0:32:22] <Frazaell> Just grab them. They can't tech while using the block button
[0:32:24] <+TeeJayVA> well, no free. At high level players might be choosing between both options
[0:32:25] <chaos2frozen> it's the same as how MK has a block button
[0:32:26] <shltthedd> does percival have fucking KOFMIA wild wolf blockstrings
[0:32:38] <+Ginger_Snaps> They can tech while using the block button but it's always a late tech
[0:32:52] <carrotc> ^
[0:33:04] <schwis_orifice> this dude gay?
[0:33:07] <carrotc> They'll take the damage and be guaranteed minus
[0:33:16] <Joey_JoestarXD> The high low and throw mixes are the most deadly too which block button doesn't save you from
[0:33:17] <Vekysus_Arashi> pretty much
[0:33:18] <schwis_orifice> why is gran's loli not playable?
[0:33:20] <Frazaell> WHO USES LMHU. JUST USE ABCD
[0:33:29] <julzbeingjulz> gdi Percival
[0:33:29] <+SkaiVibration> yessir
[0:33:32] <julzbeingjulz> So. smug
[0:33:34] <+zaledoria> Lyria doesnt fight thats why
[0:33:35] <Joey_JoestarXD> arc games use LMHU
[0:33:36] <+DanUgore> DBFZ uses LMHS
[0:33:40] <furix> GET BACK TO GRINDING YOUR NM95s!!
[0:33:50] <Dreadnautx> Bring on The WOOLIEman\

[0:33:58] <Frazaell> BBTAG?
[0:33:59] <carrotc> @Frazaell LMH notation is confirmed, it doesn't matter if you prefer ABC for this game
[0:33:59] <+Schiz_Turtles> i got here just in time, boys
[0:34:07] <Frazaell> Well fuck
[0:34:09] <Vekysus_Arashi> BeautifulDude plays Percival
[0:34:18] <+zaledoria> Gran's loli is Lyria
[0:34:18] <Frazaell> I reject your reality and replace my own.
[0:34:25] <+Gordout> who cares, everyone knows what you're saying if you use ABCD
[0:34:26] <carrotc> @zaledoria jail
[0:34:27] <julzbeingjulz> That special edition man
[0:34:28] <DontSkipMyIntro> Who does Woolie play if there's no punch girl?
[0:34:34] <schwis_orifice> @zaledoria lucky bastard that gran mofo
[0:34:44] <Frazaell> Ladiva is grab, so not a punch girl.
[0:34:49] <furix> woolie future Aliza main?
[0:34:52] <+MacaroniTurtle> If the physical premium edition came with the dlc pass I'd get that but it doesn't
[0:34:59] <Frazaell> Same.
[0:35:02] <driskolestate> That Premium Edition is available on Amazon.
[0:35:05] <Frazaell> Now I'm second-guessing
[0:35:06] <furix> oh wait Aliza is kick girl nvm
[0:35:15] <Joey_JoestarXD> woolie plays Lancelot same with kizzie
[0:35:23] <Frazaell> But I really want physical stuff.
[0:35:25] <carrotc> smh wanting a punch girl instead of Ayer-Dudley
[0:35:30] <DontSkipMyIntro> Thanks
[0:35:32] <Frazaell> Because look at that cover.
[0:35:33] <ninjaONIZUKA> hey guys did they announce anything?
[0:35:36] <furix> Ayer punches himself tho, not the opponent
[0:35:37] <+zaledoria> Aliza is my favorite and I'm gonna bbe said she isnt gonna be dlc
[0:35:39] <julzbeingjulz> Oh artbook is a treat Cygames art is wonderful
[0:35:54] <+Gemmicks> gemmicBang
[0:35:56] <G_Zus_> I want a steelbook

[0:36:23] <Frazaell> I just want Djeeta in, man
[0:36:24] <Benigmatica> Who's gonna buy for the mobile game rewards?
[0:36:25] <Rai0h> where is Shirou?

[0:36:47] <carrotc> me want brick
[0:36:52] <vulcanvolga> @sorridsnake12 too weak. also why not both :P
[0:36:54] <julzbeingjulz> Some characters may appear as non playable and even as bosses in this game
[0:36:56] <julzbeingjulz> Yes
[0:37:00] <julzbeingjulz> *Yes
[0:37:00] <Frazaell> DUDE, GIMME THE FREE GAME COPY IF YOU GUYS JUST BUY THE GAME FOR IT
[0:37:02] <Vekysus_Arashi> this art book for me is way more attractive then any Statue that other LE comes with, Cydesignation art is just so good
[0:37:08] <julzbeingjulz> Dude frick mobile
[0:37:13] <julzbeingjulz> *yet
[0:37:20] <ninjaONIZUKA> djeeta could've played exactly like gran. with a few adjustments. to give us a round 12 roster
[0:37:26] <carrotc> frick u
[0:37:29] <Rai0h> should I spark for Jeanne ass?
[0:37:32] <Neverwinner_> no
[0:37:37] <+zaledoria> I would still love the statue. My Vira scale figure is amazing looking
[0:37:38] <carrotc> no Djeeta in my wholesome Granblue reeeeeee
[0:37:40] <Frazaell> But the cutscene mannerisms would be too jarring, I think.
[0:38:02] <Frazaell> Oh yeah, I saw a summer Vira being sold at an anime figure store.
[0:38:04] <sorridsnake12> @Rai0h yes. She's really, really good
[0:38:07] <ninjaONIZUKA> different interactions. Like ryu & Ken
[0:38:21] <+Gordout> new light jeanne is amazing but save til new years imo
[0:38:23] <airco_ki> add djeeta but she's a joke character with a credit card
[0:38:30] <henkingu> you allslacking on GW. smh
[0:38:38] <+Gordout> binch im doing nm95s right now
[0:38:39] <carrotc> @henkingu we can multitask loser
[0:38:43] <+MacaroniTurtle> fuck gw
[0:38:44] <+zaledoria> Who saus we arent doing both
[0:38:49] <julzbeingjulz> ^^^^
[0:38:52] <Neverwinner_> fuck gw indeed
[0:38:55] <ninjaONIZUKA> my guild just gave up
[0:38:58] <+zaledoria> And Djeeta imo should just be a skin for gran
[0:39:06] <carrotc> Djeeta should just get yeet
[0:39:09] <Frazaell> GEO DIED FOR OUR SINS. DEATH TO GE
[0:39:12] <Frazaell> FUCK
[0:39:14] <Joey_JoestarXD> add Djeeta as a training mode dummy SoBayed
[0:39:14] <+zaledoria> Cause I mean it would be an easy way to add her
[0:39:22] <carrotc> @Joey_JoestarXD yas
[0:39:28] <Rai0h> they can't make a skin, it cost too much money with the way Arcsys is doing those 3D models
[0:39:40] <airco_ki> ASW has said before with GG that they can't do skins in their style, it takes as much work as adding a new character.
[0:39:45] <Rai0h> if they put Djeeta in, it will be an entire new character (which is better)
[0:39:49] <Frazaell> GEO DIED FOR OUR SINS. DEATH TO GUILD WARS.
[0:39:56] <Vekysus_Arashi> Djeeta and Gran have the same personality, the only difference is that she is a girl
[0:39:57] <sorridsnake12> Djetta is not in cause she's not canon. It's called GRANblue Fantasy, not Granblue fanDJEETA Kappa
[0:40:01] <Zinax7> whoa woolie!
[0:40:02] <+DoubleDaze> Woolie Pog
[0:40:09] <carrotc> @sorridsnake12 PREACH IT BRUTHA
[0:40:13] <Joey_JoestarXD> at least we are getting multiple color packs which I think you can get with pendants
[0:40:23] <Benigmatica> @Rai0h Djeeta would be a clone to Gran.
[0:40:24] <+SkaiVibration> WOOLIE
[0:40:26] <+SkaiVibration> MAN LIKE WOOLIE
[0:40:27] <ptalibaba> he is a beautiful dude
[0:40:29] <airco_ki> as far as i care the only canon there is to granblue is what gets published at comiket
[0:40:31] <+Qsmash_> pls expose Woolie
[0:40:31] <+Tearonex> sbfpYeyeye sbfpYeyeye sbfpYeyeye sbfpYeyeye
[0:40:34] <shltthedd> eyepatch on brah
[0:40:40] <Rai0h> @Benigmatica not if they pick a different class
[0:40:40] <Frazaell> She's actually called Djeeta because it's GRANblue fanTADJEE
[0:40:41] <arqa__> actually it's called granblue fanTADJEE
[0:40:44] <+zaledoria> Wait are we gonna be grinding pendants in this too? I thought I was done with that
[0:40:46] <airco_ki> so djeeta's fair game
[0:40:49] <shltthedd> dont need depth perception to do percival combo .
[0:40:50] <+BrokenMagnum> Woolie!
[0:40:51] <Triplicat> wow it's woolie versus from woolieversus
[0:40:53] <carrotc> Djeeta is never fair game
[0:40:55] <+Embee305> Is that beautifuldude?
[0:40:56] <Solidus_113> Woolie!
[0:40:56] <Neverwinner_> never seen these characters before PogChamp
[0:40:56] <carrotc> Djeeta is unfair game
[0:41:01] <Frazaell> If she was spelled as Syta, it would have made a lot of sense.
[0:41:02] <Triplicat> first name woolie last name versus
[0:41:13] <+TheCaptainX96> do combo vs Big Damage
[0:41:31] <+Embee305> Why does Beautiful Dude have an eye patch?
[0:41:54] <+daiquirincheese> think its because fire emblem
[0:42:03] <Joey_JoestarXD> punished dude
[0:42:11] <Triplicat> rip
[0:42:17] <Bloo561> his vision has problems currently
[0:42:18] <Atrklstream> chip kills PogChamp
[0:42:19] <Triplicat> it was a good idea
[0:42:22] <shltthedd> C H I P
[0:42:33] <+mccf> Wait this has chip kills?
[0:42:40] <Bloo561> yes
[0:42:40] <Atrklstream> hell yeah it does
[0:42:42] <+zettazettazetta> yes
[0:42:52] <carrotc> Yep
[0:42:56] <Silverforte> chip is really low in this game so its fine
[0:42:56] <Kaylem20201> just defends nullify chip
[0:42:57] <sorridsnake12> it's because beautiful dude is sagat
[0:42:59] <furix> this game is so sick
[0:42:59] <+zettazettazetta> makes sense, considering it has multiple zoner-types
[0:43:03] <+Eyekantspele> is there cross up protection?
[0:43:04] <carrotc> More games need to keep chip damages tbh
[0:43:05] <Joey_JoestarXD> chip kills was a necessity I think, blocking is too strong
[0:43:15] <Rooflemonger> game looks so pretty
[0:43:17] <Rai0h> Skill Icons are under the life bar? They didn't listen to any complain during the beta, right?
[0:43:27] <+SkaiVibration> yo woolie let's go!

[0:43:57] <Frazaell> @rai0h Older build.
[0:44:08] <Bloo561> I feel they didn't change it cause they wanted to keep all the information in one area
[0:44:11] <Rai0h> oh okey

[0:45:28] <+ThatPhageGuy> Did they make Beautiful Dude put his limiter eyepatch on?!
[0:45:35] <Joey_JoestarXD> they know lowain and Ladiva were too op so they kept them out of the beta for your own safety Kappa
[0:45:55] <Bloo561> lol

[0:56:44] <AnoooSaaanT> Charlotta = J. A every approach
[0:56:50] <Tsukoblue> When will Rune Factory 4 S be released in NA?
[0:56:59] <sorridsnake12> jwong was streaming tekken for a bit too
[0:57:00] <+MightyZek> @MightyZek is new here. Say hello! SeemsGood
[0:57:05] <+MacaroniTurtle> Didn't j.A get fixed in the newest build?
[0:57:10] <+Gordout> it's more street fighter than "anime" tbh
[0:57:19] <+AngelDS_150> I need a steam version of this game, I don't care if it releases 6 months later than ps4 version
[0:57:19] <nesman1995> hi @MightyZek
[0:57:26] <+Ginger_Snaps> fixed? nothing was wrong with it lol
[0:57:36] <carrotc> Only 6 months? LUL
[0:57:37] <+MightyZek> Sup @nesman1995
[0:57:37] <+Vulji> Zeta will have air dashes.
[0:57:42] <+kamen_dragoon> i cant wait to play as the big dude with the scythe
[0:57:43] <+AngelDS_150> even 1 year
[0:57:49] <nesman1995> nm @MightyZek
[0:57:49] <+yusufestacado> GG2020 is even more street fighter than this.
[0:57:51] <+Vulji> I hope that will not become a nightmare
[0:57:52] <Rai0h> @AngelDS_150 they want to make PC versions, same with GB Relink
[0:58:00] <+AngelDS_150> i know
[0:58:20] <+Vulji> "Woolie doesn't know to play Lancelot" basically
[0:58:29] <AnoooSaaanT> GG2020 felt strange especially coming from Rev2
[0:58:32] <Rai0h> street fighter is anime
[0:58:42] <Vekysus_Arashi> in this build you actually don't need to use Ex that much, it's not necessary to be honest outside of doing damage
[0:58:44] <Frazaell> Taters!
[0:58:44] <Felpier> Best potato!
[0:58:54] <Vekysus_Arashi> i think this is one of the reasons they changed the KD to be a Ex only thing
[0:59:02] <Frazaell> YOU CAN MOVE FORWARD INSTEAD OF CHARGING. SHE'S GREAT
[0:59:10] <+Vulji> let's go Holy knight captain
[0:59:25] <chaos2frozen> GG2020 has air dashing, what are you talking about it being more Street Fighter lol
[0:59:26] <+AngelDS_150> wtf charlotta
[0:59:30] <NarcissistCactus> TTours
[0:59:42] <carrotc> @chaos2frozen They're poking fun at it because of changes, lul
[0:59:43] <+yusufestacado> I mean in GBFV you can do auto chain combo at least. In GG2020 all you can do is 2p2p2p2p2pthrow
[1:00:18] <chaos2frozen> You're right, GG should have auto combos
[1:00:20] <Kain_Dizengarth_> 2P2D, 2p 6P, 2P 6k
[1:00:20] <+Ginger_Snaps> I thought 2p chained into command normals?
[1:00:27] <+sew350> kizzie2NotShook kizzie2NotShook kizzie2NotShook majinoGameplay majinoGameplay majinoGameplay
[1:00:48] <AnoooSaaanT> I will say the Gattling really felt different but need more practice on it to make a judgement then again it's just the demo it still has time to change
[1:00:54] <Vekysus_Arashi> you can also link 2L on standing normals
[1:01:03] <Vekysus_Arashi> just like any other FG
[1:01:13] <Vekysus_Arashi> not GG2020 LUL
[1:01:13] <Triplicat> GET IT SHAKA
[1:01:26] <Vekysus_Arashi> you need to use a command normal for it
[1:01:35] <WTFTreeman> PogChamp
[1:01:39] <+SkaiVibration> MIX
[1:01:41] <nayout> WTF
[1:01:42] <NarcissistCactus> woolie taking notes
[1:01:46] <+Vulji> See this is how you play Lancelot
[1:02:10] <+AngelDS_150> kizzie knows how lancelot works
[1:02:17] <Rai0h> Black Knight would look so fucking sick with Arcsys artstyle, but she will never be in it since she is not in the base game, they will only pick the most popular for DLCs
[1:02:38] <sorridsnake12> I NEED TO SEE NOBLE EXECUTION
[1:02:44] <little_grease> more jump a pls
[1:02:51] <AnoooSaaanT> can chip to death
[1:03:02] <Aquios_> You mean Excalibur VoHiYo
[1:03:09] <Neverwinner_> no you dont
[1:03:09] <WTFTreeman> black knight would be PogChamp
[1:03:20] <+yusufestacado> No FD but chip kill in GBFV. No chip kill but FD in GG2020. ArcSys claims they have "vision"
[1:03:24] <Aquios_> Which Black Knight Kappa
[1:03:25] <+Vulji> Apollonia should absolutely be in
[1:03:25] <Silverforte> i just looked up black knight, so basically a judge magister, thats sick
[1:03:29] <+yusufestacado> That's some real galaxy vision they have
[1:03:37] <Atrklstream> EXSU
[1:03:37] <+AngelDS_150> EXCALIBUUUR

[1:04:18] <Agckuu_Coceg> Straight to the box Lancelot goes

[1:04:22] <Aquios_> See, Excalibur VoHiYo
[1:04:22] <carrotc> o lmao they're crewmates
[1:04:26] <+zaledoria> They slaccing
[1:04:32] <undeuxtroisqua> EXXXCARRIIBBBAAAAAAAAA
[1:04:36] <Frazaell> WHAT THE FUCK ARE YOU GUYS DOING, SLACKING ON GW
[1:04:41] <Aquios_> Apollonia without the armor
[1:04:45] <+Vulji> Take that Lancelot and chain him in the dungeon
[1:05:00] <+Vulji> Naked Apollonia Kreygasm
[1:05:07] <LOK_Stiff_Steve> qtest exukiriba you'll ever see
[1:05:21] <carrotc> Apollonia DansGame
[1:05:23] <pyookoomookoo> is this the old version of the game?
[1:05:27] <Atrklstream> yes
[1:05:46] <+Vulji> Respect the black knight
[1:05:49] <Rai0h> Just imagine Black Knight with a Dark Essence mode
[1:05:53] <pyookoomookoo> i hope they don't take out knockdowns fr
[1:06:15] <Triplicat> I still don't know why that Charlotta route is so inconsistent
[1:06:28] <sorridsnake12> If Black night was in they'd use her Original ougi as her skybound and her 5* Ougi as her super skybound
[1:06:38] <outlawvinegar> afaict linking into 46 only works on crouching
[1:06:42] <Frazaell> Should've spot dodged. Kappa
[1:06:47] <ninjaONIZUKA> i need black knight in this asap
[1:06:51] <orlando_benreed> yeah, it's like gear, you get extra hitstun on crouching
[1:07:00] <+SeraphyxP> We need to Charlotta "Yaaaaa!" victory
[1:07:04] <sorridsnake12> Too bad, no Black Knight. You get Naru instead
[1:07:13] <ninjaONIZUKA> F :(
[1:07:16] <Rai0h> as DLC*
[1:07:24] <+kamen_dragoon> tell me why seigfreid isnt in this game
[1:07:26] <+Vulji> Give me my boy Spinnah
[1:07:27] <+zaledoria> No big tiddie draph means all bad characters
[1:07:28] <+TheCaptainX96> Any chance that Kamen rider guy will make it in?
[1:07:28] <ninjaONIZUKA> Id take her as dlc
[1:07:45] <+kamen_dragoon> hes cain from ff but with dark knight weapon
[1:07:45] <Rai0h> @kamen_dragoon because Siegfried will sell a lot of DLC
[1:07:48] <outlawvinegar> because there are already 2 dragon knights, they've already got so much representation
[1:07:49] <ninjaONIZUKA> nicholas?
[1:07:57] <anwoPrinz> Vaseraga is a draph with big titty
[1:07:59] <+kamen_dragoon> ill buy him
[1:08:06] <+kamen_dragoon> ill buy everything on him
[1:08:06] <+TheCaptainX96> Yes
[1:08:07] <MetalVictini> Can this game be understood without having played the mobile game?
[1:08:14] <Agckuu_Coceg> Easily.
[1:08:15] <+Vulji> yes
[1:08:16] <+zaledoria> Yes it can be
[1:08:16] <jiorone> yes
[1:08:18] <sorridsnake12> @TheCaptainX96 Shirou doesn't look likely to make it
[1:08:18] <catgirl1477> yes!
[1:08:20] <+Gordout> yes
[1:08:22] <ninjaONIZUKA> Metal, yeah they designed it like that
[1:08:29] <+Vulji> Shirou as very low chance imo
[1:08:33] <+kamen_dragoon> ive never played the mobile game and i love this
[1:08:35] <+Vulji> has*
[1:08:39] <+308caliber> well that was underwhelming
[1:08:41] <Rai0h> I think they say that they wanted to but Sieg instead of Lancelot but he was not ready, so he will certainly be in the first season
[1:08:41] <+Gordout> shirou would be sick but yeah that's not happening
[1:08:42] <catgirl1477> shirou;;
[1:08:42] <ciapolillas> @ciapolillas is new here. Say hello! VoHiYo
[1:08:48] <+Gordout> would love shirou in his suit
[1:08:50] <+ha1fwaycrook> That pressure
[1:08:51] <+kamen_dragoon> my friend started showing me designs i want in this game though
[1:09:00] <carrotc> Don't play the mobile game or you will be trapped in true hell @kamen_dragoon
[1:09:07] <carrotc> 10/10 mobile RPG don't play it Kappa
[1:09:11] <Vekysus_Arashi> See? Kizzie only use Ex for Chip Kills, because KD is just guaranteed from most moves
[1:09:12] <little_grease> who's Thhe guy with mask n claw
[1:09:19] <carrotc> Or else you'll be like me, grinding while watching stream
[1:09:23] <ninjaONIZUKA> there's so many crazy designs i want in VS
[1:09:26] <catgirl1477> six
[1:09:28] <+DoubleDaze> six
[1:09:29] <ninjaONIZUKA> Six?
[1:09:30] <sorridsnake12> @Gordout He'd be so awesome in his metal gear revengance gigante suit
[1:09:31] <catgirl1477> y
[1:09:36] <Rai0h> my bet is that 3 of the 5 DLCs are Vira / Naru / Sieg
[1:09:41] <+ndarkstar> It's fine. You can auto through GW while watching the stream.
[1:09:41] <little_grease> six ya put him in
[1:09:42] <+Vulji> I'm fine with everyone making it for dlc, except Djeeta.
[1:09:47] <+zaledoria> And Beatrix
[1:09:51] <+DoubleDaze> im hella bias, gimme sandalphon
[1:09:56] <+Vulji> Don't waste a slot with bland MC female
[1:09:56] <Neverwinner_> i'm fine with everyone too as long as it's not jeanne
[1:09:56] <ninjaONIZUKA> I want Belial & Jeanne
[1:09:59] <carrotc> Sandalphon Kreygasm
[1:10:04] <ninjaONIZUKA> ..
[1:10:07] <+kamen_dragoon> @carrotc dont worry, i dont play gacha
[1:10:09] <+zaledoria> I'm a straight guy but Sandalphon does it for me
[1:10:11] <+DoubleDaze> im so bitter about jeanne rn
[1:10:13] <carrotc> @kamen_dragoon how dare u
[1:10:18] <carrotc> Kappa
[1:10:21] <+Vulji> Sandal Kreygasm
[1:10:27] <Vekysus_Arashi> why hate on Jeanne?
[1:10:28] <+DoubleDaze> sandalphon with the tight leggings and heels
[1:10:30] <outlawvinegar> naru will get in over yuisis but I still want her instead
[1:10:35] <+Vulji> Make me some coffee my angel plz
[1:10:35] <+mccf> because they couldn't roll that ass
[1:10:38] <88thestreammonster> season 1 is gonna be all gran but a different job
[1:10:39] <+kamen_dragoon> unless you count metal slug attack as a gacha
[1:10:41] <Neverwinner_> because she's boring and she gets too much cygames favouritism already
[1:10:44] <+DoubleDaze> cos she powercreeped herself in her ele after a rework lmao, im mad
[1:10:46] <orlando_benreed> corner defense is rough with char with spaced fireball strings cause it's basically IB, parry, or nothing -- she has the speed for abare, but not much for reach
[1:10:59] <Atrklstream> this is gonna hurt
[1:11:02] <+Vulji> EXCALIBUR
[1:11:04] <+DoubleDaze> WHERE GRAND REIN cirREE
[1:11:04] <carrotc> @kamen_dragoon If you do look at it soem of the story content actually cool as frick
[1:11:05] <WTFTreeman> monkaS
[1:11:07] <outlawvinegar> can roll forward through the fireball, unless they took that mechanic out

[1:31:45] <AnoooSaaanT> oh wow the box art from premium looks good i kinda want that instead of the V formation we have atm
[1:31:52] <fgcstone> lmao
[1:31:54] <ninjaONIZUKA> dlc akuma xD
[1:31:56] <Criminalbmc_97> dlc terry is just anila
[1:31:57] <fgcstone> SNK takeover
[1:31:59] <+Vulji> Macho Vyrn is secret boss of the rpg mode 100%
[1:32:01] <zakki_with_melon> dlc Grimnir
[1:32:06] <Criminalbmc_97> i mean she does have buster wolf ougi
[1:32:06] <+alicehanshra> Yeah it's really a problem that the season pass isn't in the physical edition
[1:32:07] <pleblight> ahhh don't mind that either
[1:32:11] <fgcstone> oh, then heroines Terry
[1:32:17] <+zaledoria> Grimnir is being removed from the mobile game
[1:32:19] <+AngelDS_150> machovyrn dlc
[1:32:24] <+alicehanshra> BibleThump BibleThump BibleThump
[1:32:29] <+alicehanshra> Don't remove Grim
[1:32:33] <PlumpPotatoRump> New demo, ima guess
[1:32:40] <ninjaONIZUKA> i might need this premium edition
[1:32:48] <Criminalbmc_97> machovyrn dlc so every intro can be "who could Vyrn POSSIBLY be?!' for another 5 years
[1:33:19] <pleblight> nah I just like grand blues vee personality
[1:33:20] <AnoooSaaanT> if only the premium added the 5 dlc with it I would buy this
[1:33:30] <pleblight> and since he can morph into anything
[1:33:35] <+Vulji> I would love to have the OST and the artbook but fuck having to buy the season ass separately...
[1:33:38] <+alicehanshra> I'm still gonna buy the premium.
[1:33:40] <Criminalbmc_97> Knife hand vee was a treat
[1:33:41] <jiorone> premium is 80$
[1:33:46] <+alicehanshra> I just really hope they change it or something
[1:33:52] <jiorone> thats why don't include DLC
[1:33:53] <watasan> @watasan is new here. Say hello! VoHiYo
[1:33:57] <Zinax7> man why they go to xseed for publisher
[1:34:01] <RantingDuck> can't someone there ask them or something
[1:34:05] <jiorone> you can buy it appart
[1:34:07] <pleblight> I think price for premium which comes with art book and ost isn't a bad deal imo

[1:35:46] <tonton151> When is Ayer

[1:35:51] <pleblight> It's because rollback is a big cost risk. have to have the Entire game and maybe even the engine trvovle around it
[1:35:56] <Criminalbmc_97> it's unfortunately too late for ggpo at launch at least
