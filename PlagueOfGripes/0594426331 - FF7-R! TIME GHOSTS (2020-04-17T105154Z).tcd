[0:02:26] <BurdRightsActivist> Oh look it's a dragon
[0:02:28] <BurdRightsActivist> I'd fuck him
[0:03:23] <mrgaster8> o your streaming
[0:03:29] <examplez0> Can't wait for the Neo and Zero Bahamut fights
[0:06:18] <mrgaster8> this is going to take a min
[0:08:00] <%caramello_man> Twice in one day! What is this sorcery?
[0:16:15] <+psydaku> did you ever complete the 200% stagger challenge? If so, how?
[0:17:00] <%Demirose41> to stagger the bastard you gotta use attacks like focus thrust on cloud and overpower focused strike to interrupt the count down
[0:17:37] <fillmydarksoulwithlight> @psydaku fight fat chocobo get him to stagget, power up tifa twice with unbridled strength and then do rise and fall knto omnistrike
[0:18:21] <examplez0> If only there was a VR battle where you could fight Chadley himself
[0:18:36] <%Demirose41> but chadley is like 20 ft tall
[0:19:24] <%caramello_man> and he uses the monocle to focus sunlight on you like an asshole
[0:20:03] <fluffy_sauce> jesus, he's still streaming
[0:20:17] <fillmydarksoulwithlight> plague whats your playtime at
[0:26:48] <%Demirose41> \
[0:26:50] <Zinax7> has mr plague finished the game yet?
[0:26:53] <rasmus206060> LUL
[0:27:32] <examplez0> "mr plague" lmao

[0:28:38] <the_king_of_the_south> use regen and haste
[0:29:21] <sosandstorm> woah, surprised to see you up, am I catching the end or beginning of the stream?
[0:29:30] <Quinnotetiquan> this a first playthrough?
[0:29:33] <shin_marx> unlocking summons by fighting them is a really cool challenge
[0:29:45] <joanna9700> Prepare for a viewer spike Plague, twitch is dying elsewhere
[0:29:55] <Cybersoul666> Ahoy plague!
[0:30:02] <+kewlmyc> Might want to farm out Revive, to get auto-life
[0:30:10] <medril07> beaten the game I'm guessing?
[0:30:46] <+kewlmyc> I mean he's doing post game content, so yeah
[0:31:01] <examplez0> No he hasn't
[0:31:04] <%caramello_man> nah he's not finished yet
[0:31:23] <+kewlmyc> Huh, I stand corrected then
[0:31:25] <examplez0> He's doing all the side stuff before progressing forward
[0:31:33] <+kewlmyc> Just a shitton of grinding
[0:31:37] <examplez0> Yep
[0:31:45] <examplez0> He was doing it off stream but now he's back
[0:33:33] <Djinnazz> Cutscene mine?
[0:33:40] <+snugglepuggs> cutscene mine?
[0:33:52] <Djinnazz> did it crash or something?
[0:33:56] <valriot> The airduct?
[0:33:57] <%caramello_man> he hit progress so he had to reload
[0:34:11] <SilverRoddo> Cutscene claymore
[0:35:10] <smugfox95> Midgar Space Agency
[0:35:20] <%laserbeaming> Barret is indeed an angel
[0:35:21] <inmate5580> The old gods ate rising and the crave blood of the innocent and the damned. Prostrate yourself and worship their glory, praise their names for its synonymous with perfection
[0:35:49] <joanna9700> Crap where did Barret learn about the Special Beam Cannon?
[0:36:18] <%caramello_man> I just realised barret is wearing his sunglasses in VR
[0:36:18] <%laserbeaming> I'm guessing this is the Post Game Dimension?
[0:36:29] <silvcrest> nope
[0:37:47] <Relinfearous> BasedGod
[0:38:38] <SilverRoddo> We are, we are VRâ€”virtual reality
[0:39:04] <Cybersoul666> Woah is that the power of dlc?
[0:39:28] <%laserbeaming> Oh, they changed it from Dolphin Blow to Dolphin Flurry? A shame.
[0:39:59] <Djinnazz> It's a dmg race
[0:40:55] <Djinnazz> actually it's a stagger race.
[0:42:32] <PatchySouls> @laserbeaming The localization team knew too much about the implications
[0:42:42] <PatchySouls> sad day
[0:42:48] <%laserbeaming> indeed
[0:44:28] <availablethor> Where are we in the story right now?
[0:44:34] <Djinnazz> GG
[0:44:38] <valriot> Imagine calling Bahamut an asshole
[0:44:45] <%caramello_man> nice work plague!
[0:44:47] <fillmydarksoulwithlight> gg congrats
[0:44:51] <SilverRoddo> kingkrUGG
[0:44:52] <examplez0> gg no re
[0:44:54] <+snugglepuggs> SAVE UR GAME
[0:45:10] <examplez0> Yeah could you say that a bit louder Chadley
[0:45:13] <kiwicoffin> I'm a boy genius so I can just poo out this ultimate summon
[0:45:17] <examplez0> I don't think the president quite heard you
[0:45:30] <fluffy_sauce> so before you even leave Midgar, you get like half the summons in the entire OG?
[0:45:43] <PatchySouls> arent there summons that are more ultimate than bahamut in OG ff7 anyway
[0:45:47] <examplez0> No more CHadley forever
[0:46:21] <valriot> Reminds me of old FF7 where you'd just gimmick and bullshit a boss to death once you know how
[0:46:30] <silvcrest> bahamut zero. knights
[0:46:43] <examplez0> You'd better save here
[0:46:52] <silvcrest> im forgetting a few @patchysouls
[0:46:53] <wotebi> can you summon bahamut to fight bahamut?
[0:46:54] <examplez0> I'd hate for you to go through that again
[0:47:22] <PatchySouls> @silvcrest I know Knights of the Round is one of them
[0:47:37] <%laserbeaming> too bad you can't have loadouts
[0:47:38] <+thatfig> what chapter we on
[0:47:45] <silvcrest> there is another version of bahamut as well
[0:47:46] <fillmydarksoulwithlight> 16
[0:47:49] <+thatfig> oooo
[0:47:54] <silvcrest> in the og
[0:48:14] <@Nightbot> Plague is a youtube animator and also streams at https://picarto.tv/Plague . Also: t-shirts! http://goo.gl/lze8QO
[0:48:36] <smugfox95> Its Cloud, from FF7!
[0:48:43] <PatchySouls> Wait, you could fight Bahamut at this part? goddamn.
[0:48:56] <kiwicoffin> Look dude it's Cloud from Kingdom Hearts 3!
[0:49:06] <examplez0> If only the time ghosts could have progressing before
[0:49:13] <+UnwoundCaesar70> Kunsel finna send u emails
[0:49:15] <examplez0> Could have stopped you from progressing
[0:49:17] <PatchySouls> time ghosts summon Yoroza to fuck up Sephiroth
[0:49:19] <PatchySouls> so cool!
[0:49:19] <valriot> Yeah Bahamut just unlocks once you do all of Chadleys stuff
[0:49:21] <+clausover> that crisis core reference\
[0:49:29] <%caramello_man> oh no, the chairs!
[0:49:32] <penitentpentwitch> Make sure to keep some materia on all characters, there're fights in the future that require you to use everyone. Annoying as that is.
[0:49:41] <fluffy_sauce> they're level 50?!
[0:49:41] <availablethor> Cloud is very crazy.
[0:49:51] <+snugglepuggs> u grinded to level 50?
[0:50:01] <examplez0> Sticking it to Shinra
[0:50:01] <+Zenzei> Zenzei subscribed with Twitch Prime. 
[0:50:14] <fluffy_sauce> why is it able to go up to level 50?
[0:50:35] <penitentpentwitch> Some poor Janitor: "I JUST fixed this!"
[0:51:35] <fillmydarksoulwithlight> John DiMaggio is fun at least
[0:51:35] <umbilicalsky9> weyland-yutani
[0:51:37] <PatchySouls> vineTubby shitty bender
[0:52:30] <penitentpentwitch> The solo ones can be tough
[0:52:52] <fillmydarksoulwithlight> the solos ones sucked for barret the most on mine
[0:52:55] <PatchySouls> Solo Tifa is basically a race to stagger, then you slay them
[0:53:01] <PatchySouls> kinda comical
[0:53:39] <penitentpentwitch> The sweet relief of a safety save
[0:53:45] <mrgaster8> 66 hours jee
[0:53:46] <%laserbeaming> Dance the Safety Save Dance
[0:54:17] <fillmydarksoulwithlight> early morning stream
