[0:00:03] <arkv01> oooo we back
[0:00:11] <arkv01> twitter is too lewd
[0:00:13] <Apolonm> VoHiYo
[0:00:28] <RykerSkies> good old partial loss of connectivity, definitely not your fault but definitely not something you can fix
[0:00:30] <vonmaultke> PogChamp we get to keep complaining about this
[0:00:53] <JohnClaggart> you could record locally while streaming
[0:01:07] <Bizerco> Cats truly are the vermin of Midgar.
[0:01:13] <impartialcredit> a clock pastry?
[0:01:16] <Bizerco> Instead of Pigeons they have cats.
[0:01:28] <arkv01> even cloud is like these fukken cats
[0:01:37] <vonmaultke> fuzzy little shit
[0:01:45] <SilverRoddo> HahaCat HahaCat
[0:01:48] <arkv01> actually adds a lot to his characterization
[0:01:53] <+sourceofall> then stop?
[0:01:54] <arkv01> uh oh gg internets
[0:02:01] <Bizerco> The cat stole her sweet roll.
[0:02:02] <arkv01> uh my bad that was me LUL
[0:02:56] <vonmaultke> I don't remember a johnny? dodMiss
[0:03:04] <terminusterminal> You don't remmeber Johnny from the original games?
[0:03:15] <JohnClaggart> johnny was always there

[0:03:45] <arkv01> man they are gonna kill that boy
[0:03:50] <vonmaultke> Oh one of they guys at the market
[0:03:54] <CyberDingus> How much did I miss?
[0:04:00] <JohnClaggart> shinra have copters
[0:04:19] <terminusterminal> Is that Yuri Lowenthal again?
[0:04:34] <Bizerco> Isn't everyone Yuri Lowenthal in Japan? I thought he was Citizen number 4?
[0:04:41] <SilverRoddo> Greg Ayers?
[0:05:01] <arkv01> oh that was amazing LUL
[0:05:14] <vonmaultke> @CyberDingus Destiny Plot Ghosts, Anime white haired genius kid tropes, and some good visuals
[0:05:15] <arkv01> I thought we were entering into the johnny dies cutscene as clodd watches
[0:05:20] <vonmaultke> Anything i missed?
[0:05:33] <JohnClaggart> plague scan
[0:06:02] <CitrousCt> Props to you Plague for wanting to continue with FF7 despite knowing how it ends
[0:06:05] <arkv01> WEW big number
[0:06:30] <Murphio_GS> Those poor puppies
[0:06:41] <arkv01> I expect hard mode unlock after first run maybe?
[0:06:54] <Leichenfresser> Don't kill Johnny Depp
[0:07:08] <arkv01> damn I thought clodd was ready to kill civvies
[0:07:08] <CitrousCt> Bye Yuri Lowenthal
[0:07:17] <JohnClaggart> this is worse than original for johnny
[0:07:35] <Bizerco> Stop thinking about logic, Retcons only work if we don't think about how pointless and dumb they are.
[0:07:37] <Chester_goes_Berserk> it's an excuse to develop cloud and tifa, yeah
[0:07:38] <Gruedo> big beautiful anime eyes
[0:07:40] <arkv01> wake up? bitch we gotta silence them
[0:07:46] <Leichenfresser> Waking up from Buster Sword cuts... yep.
[0:07:49] <+RAAAAAINMAKER> He was gonna fucking Johnny just to shut him up
[0:07:54] <+RAAAAAINMAKER> kill*
[0:07:57] <+FrenchTact1cs> the party REAA
[0:08:01] <Bizerco> Noone ever dies in a Final Fantasy game... they're just sleeping... noones ever really gone..
[0:08:05] <CyberDingus> KID FRIENDLY
[0:08:20] <kiwicoffin> I wonder if the japanese makes more sense
[0:08:21] <vonmaultke> You cut them up with a sword the size of a surf board
[0:08:28] <Murphio_GS> hot red eyes
[0:08:30] <vonmaultke> they should be dead
[0:08:38] <CitrousCt> The Buster Sword is just a foam replica of the Dragon Slayer
[0:08:48] <+Axellogic> I think you are safe now
[0:08:57] <+Axellogic> Just dont go back to the bar
[0:09:06] <SilverRoddo> “Their parachutes deployed, they’re okay.”
[0:09:09] <Leichenfresser> damn you chairs!
[0:09:10] <Chester_goes_Berserk> yeah bar is progression
[0:09:12] <arkv01> bar is progress yeah
[0:09:15] <CitrousCt> @PlagueOfGripes So how goes quarantine?
[0:09:27] <Rodzzila> Is like the Batman for CollegeHumor that put the villains to "sleep" LUL
[0:09:28] <+FrenchTact1cs> you have to open the door. you're safe
[0:09:33] <Zohare> You'll get a point of no return choice if you do wander near
[0:09:35] <+RAAAAAINMAKER> It's all story to about chapter 9 after this slum section
[0:09:38] <Murphio_GS> DOOM rats
[0:09:39] <Bizerco> Isn't Plague always Quarantined on his farm? Where no sane Mortal Dare Venture?
[0:09:51] <CitrousCt> Fair enough
[0:10:00] <CitrousCt> Even an actual plague won't touch him
[0:10:03] <saddlezilla1> So does Cloud being down for murder only scare Tifa, or excite her as well?
[0:10:27] <Bizerco> This is a modern game, murder is bad mang.
[0:10:40] <arkv01> oh no poor child
[0:10:46] <Leichenfresser> they teleported
[0:10:58] <CitrousCt> Is it just me, or is this game boosting some serious aliasing?
[0:11:11] <Gavaline> Why does every child and animal think that twink with a sword Cloud is scary?
[0:11:27] <CyberDingus> they fear the Edge
[0:11:37] <sonofthedeepsouth> I mean Plague Childhoods were meant to be killed afterall
[0:11:37] <Leichenfresser> I mean Cloud might not look scary, but a man-sized sword is still a man-sized sword.
[0:11:40] <arkv01> drakes?>
[0:11:45] <arkv01> jesus christ, midgar is dangerous
[0:11:48] <sonofthedeepsouth> XP
[0:11:49] <+FrenchTact1cs> DRAAAKE!?
[0:11:51] <CitrousCt> What, giant ducks?
[0:11:52] <sonofthedeepsouth> Yeah
[0:12:00] <terminusterminal> Like male ducks>
[0:12:02] <+Suplexsenpai> Cull
[0:12:08] <terminusterminal> Here to drill dick the world
[0:12:11] <CitrousCt> Could go for some foie gras
[0:12:15] <Bizerco> This is a world where people have gun arms and legs, I doubt a Giant Sword would be that scary.
[0:12:19] <saddlezilla1> @Gavaline to be fair if so KPOP looking fucker showed up to my door w/ a giant sword and immaculate eyebrows, I'd be scared...
[0:12:29] <arkv01> thats some nightmare fuel
[0:12:32] <sonofthedeepsouth> They climb now
[0:12:41] <Bizerco> "Oh no, my gun leg accidentally went off when I sat down! Everyone is dead! ...Whoops."
[0:12:51] <eluded_> They fly now!
[0:12:51] <SilverRoddo> They’ve adapted!
[0:12:58] <Leichenfresser> They fly now.
[0:13:22] <CitrousCt> So, is it safe to assume Yuffie and Cid aren't in the game?
[0:13:31] <saddlezilla1> So how annoying d'yall think Yuffie will be?
[0:13:36] <Leichenfresser> that's kinda cute
[0:13:40] <+Suplexsenpai> Surprisingly big
[0:13:44] <CitrousCt> Cloud jump good
[0:13:46] <+FrenchTact1cs> she's too powerful for the area. bosses will let you stress test her.
[0:13:50] <sonofthedeepsouth> He flies now?
[0:14:00] <sonofthedeepsouth> Kappa
[0:14:03] <Gavaline> How else will they get to the inevitable Advent Children choreography?
[0:14:07] <Leichenfresser> weak to farts
[0:14:11] <@Nightbot> Plague is a youtube animator and also streams at https://picarto.tv/Plague . Also: t-shirts! http://goo.gl/lze8QO
[0:14:24] <CitrousCt> Can someone explain the FF7 compilation story to me?
[0:14:33] <CitrousCt> Like did humanity go extinct basically?
[0:14:37] <sonofthedeepsouth> Bladder at risk
[0:14:47] <Leichenfresser> the FF7 compilation story is that Gackt really wanted to be in FF7.
[0:15:22] <Bizerco> Imagine 90's Japanese storytelling and a plot revolving around poluition and capitalism @CitrousCt
[0:15:54] <CitrousCt> Right. But I vaguely recall that the beginning of Advent Children takes place hundreds of years after ff7
[0:16:06] <Bizerco> Basically people made the earth really dirty and thats why everything is bad. Its more or less the OverBlood 2 plot.
[0:16:20] <eluded_> I'm sure Vincent will show up early, he's Nomura's favorite edgy boy
[0:16:28] <TheWe4pon> good
[0:16:29] <Leichenfresser> looks nice plague
[0:16:29] <Aleate> Its nice :)
[0:16:30] <Gavaline> Comfy and fine
[0:16:30] <Frankomancer> this is sweet, i like it
[0:16:30] <vonmaultke> Looks good
[0:16:31] <%bettysharkface> A fancy boy
[0:16:32] <+lojack69> it's beautiful
[0:16:34] <+Suplexsenpai> Nice :)
[0:16:35] <arkv01> it's nice, kinda shrinks the total area tho
[0:16:52] <JohnClaggart> i like the smaller plague window
[0:16:57] <impartialcredit> i call them treasures
[0:17:00] <sonofthedeepsouth> Flying Bastards
[0:17:01] <SilverRoddo> It’s a beautiful layout.
[0:17:06] <saddlezilla1> @CitrousCt The after credits end of OG FF7 showed REd XIII 500 years later & Midgar reclaimed by nature. Basically implying all was right w/ the world.
[0:17:10] <+UmoLoco> whoa that npc looks like Plague!
[0:17:23] <Gavaline> You're sure good at being an ex-soldier Cloud
[0:17:28] <CitrousCt> @saddlezilla1 I remember that. But did they talk about what happened to humanity?
[0:17:48] <arkv01> buncha lil cuties!
[0:17:59] <jiin6> it was basically kill rats til they showup
[0:18:11] <sonofthedeepsouth> Red XIII introduction scene will be pretty fun. Remember what he was supposed to be doing in the original....Mating!
[0:18:19] <CitrousCt> Cause I get finding cleaner and more sustainable solutions for pollution, less so for bringing humanity back to the hunter gatherer age
[0:18:22] <sonofthedeepsouth> Yeah I will make all of you remember
[0:18:41] <+RAAAAAINMAKER> Tifa is just racks up stagger with constant pressure
[0:18:58] <saddlezilla1> @CitrousCt No. But after the Red XIII scene it fades to black & you hear children laughing. Implying either humanity was ok somewhere or at peace in the Lifestream.
[0:19:04] <Gavaline> Did you make sure to ASSESS the doomrats?
[0:19:13] <CitrousCt> Fair enough
[0:19:41] <CitrousCt> Kinda weird way to end off considering the compilation had some serious plot holes
[0:19:45] <arkv01> you're the doormat, simp kun
[0:20:02] <Bizerco> Most games from the 90s had plot holes, we called them "Transplation gaps".
[0:20:12] <sonofthedeepsouth> Simp Kun is every ntr story protagonist
[0:20:12] <Bizerco> Translation*
[0:20:15] <saddlezilla1> Well the comp only came into being after FF7's success, they didn't plan it.
[0:20:18] <Leichenfresser> this is Gackt and this is my favorite store in FF7.
[0:20:23] <mihokspawn> First mod for the PC version "Shepard as Cloud"
[0:20:26] <SilverRoddo> He has a Grammy.
[0:20:27] <arkv01> so is this blitzball prelude theme trying to connect FFX with ff7?
[0:20:31] <arkv01> cause it's a fun overlap
[0:20:31] <mihokspawn> first non NSFW
[0:20:34] <sonofthedeepsouth> What do you mean simp kun you were kidnapped and forced to watch
[0:20:35] <Gavaline> We could always have ended with the "amazing" story beats of Dirge instead :)
[0:20:50] <Bizerco> @arkv01 Assets cost money, make sure to hide and reuse them. Gotta use all the kill.
[0:20:50] <JohnClaggart> yes its the blitzball music
[0:21:03] <CitrousCt> BLEETZBALL
[0:21:10] <sonofthedeepsouth> Tifa has mantained her beefers
[0:21:14] <JohnClaggart> i expect episode 2 to have ride my chocobo
[0:21:14] <saddlezilla1> Dear god dirge... i know most of the comp was meh, but if there was just one i could annihilate from existence...
[0:21:17] <%caramello_man> bye plague
[0:21:19] <eluded_> quiz: are Tifa's bobble troubles at a comfortable size for everyone here? they're still kinda scary to me
[0:21:22] <arkv01> my god tifa, you queen
[0:21:23] <sonofthedeepsouth> BLADDER
[0:21:23] <saddlezilla1> bye dude
[0:21:27] <sonofthedeepsouth> SHEEEIT
[0:21:30] <arkv01> thanks fam, see ya tmrw!
[0:21:34] <%bettysharkface> Good stream

[0:21:48] <widowmakerassnice> Have a good night or day
[0:21:53] <arkv01> pat can succ my crimes!
