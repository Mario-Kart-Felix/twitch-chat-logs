[0:09:16] <TheIncoherentGamer> the weirdest
[0:09:23] <uncleholly> when was the last time Plague drew a human
[0:09:26] <uncleholly> Launch?
[0:09:27] <Another_Rhombus> Neferpito needs more art
[0:09:28] <jsikandere> cat, fish or bird. Make your choice.
[0:09:28] <+modmanawesome69> Rip my N word Nate Dogg
[0:09:33] <BrachyZoid> To be fair, humans are boring
[0:09:40] <Triblade1992> Hello
[0:09:44] <antwan121000> thats not true
[0:09:46] <+BourbonneBlack> ruffle some feathers
[0:09:49] <+Termoil313> I wanna see Plague's high school art work
[0:09:54] <FauxGateau> pitou got done dirty...
[0:09:55] <editorsebas> ant cat
[0:09:56] <uncleholly> I dunno, man. Goblin Slayer is mostly human
[0:09:57] <TheIncoherentGamer> to be fair all of them are humanoids thats basicually human
[0:10:09] <antwan121000> cat girls are just humans with headbands your just jerking it to humans
[0:10:12] <SlayrideTwinsinner> Well I mean.... Neferpitou's a chimera ant with cat shit in them and we dunno if they're male or female so -shrug-
[0:10:26] <+Termoil313> SourPls
[0:10:28] <TheIncoherentGamer> who said anything to jerk I just really like his art
[0:10:34] <antwan121000> sure
[0:10:37] <antwan121000> fam sure
[0:10:38] <uncleholly> Well if we're gonna draw a cat thing why boner, then we have to go with Schrodinger
[0:10:40] <TheIncoherentGamer> and him
[0:10:46] <SlayrideTwinsinner> Alrighty Medli art it seems.
[0:10:47] <Triblade1992> I prefer my cat girl more human with a little cat like Yoruichi
[0:10:48] <FauxGateau> from hellsing?
[0:10:50] <TheIncoherentGamer> eli always fun to watch
[0:10:56] <uncleholly> Yeah from Hellsing
[0:10:58] <AgentZombieMan> Ariba

[0:11:09] <FauxGateau> cat boy genius
[0:11:09] <SlayrideTwinsinner> I'll share it with my Zelda fanboy friend when it's done.
[0:11:09] <jsikandere> i think the biggest question here is does medli have a cloaca or normal junk?
[0:11:17] <Vladimir_Lemon> Where can people vote?
[0:11:19] <FauxGateau> cloaca clearly
[0:11:20] <EmeraldSage> heck yea , medlei
[0:11:25] <AgentZombieMan> How about Sheeva from Mortal Kombat? How is she placing?
[0:11:26] <SlayrideTwinsinner> Oh right yeah
[0:11:27] <antwan121000> huh plauge kinda looks like a skinny version of reviewtechusa
[0:11:33] <FauxGateau> just like pallegina from pillars
[0:11:33] <+mistersokar> @PlagueOfGripes is this another one of your crazy fusions?
[0:11:38] <SlayrideTwinsinner> Might want a repost of the strrawpoll in case people missed it.

[0:12:11] <jsikandere> rosemary
[0:12:14] <SlayrideTwinsinner> Sheesh that spike
[0:12:15] <vladtet909> Bird girl could use some more art.
[0:12:18] <AgentZombieMan> If Plague vapes I will kill myself
[0:12:20] <FauxGateau> oh he's got a diffuser
[0:12:21] <antwan121000> fish girl is for lewds
[0:12:21] <TheIncoherentGamer> Lemon always a decent choice
[0:12:22] <Prism_Wing> fragrance of water.
[0:12:26] <+SpectralShot> Oh hey it's better looking Pat
[0:12:27] <uncleholly> plague no, the game awards told us not to vape
[0:12:27] <+Termoil313> Peppermint "stimulates the brain"
[0:12:31] <FauxGateau> it's essential oils probably
[0:12:36] <Prism_Wing> The beach!
[0:12:38] <person181> it's cuz paige isn't hear to kiss her feat
[0:12:43] <OrangeGameCinema> Yeah you going to be drawing medli? Nice

[0:14:24] <FunkyRot> what a momentous day, Eli eats a nanner
[0:14:25] <vladtet909> A bird a cat and a fish. That'd be one messed up trifusion
[0:14:26] <uncleholly> what we do need
[0:14:31] <uncleholly> Is a robot trifusion
[0:14:34] <TheIncoherentGamer> It would be weird
[0:14:41] <uncleholly> like Appleseed, Alphonse, and uhhhhh
[0:14:43] <Vladimir_Lemon> That's how the monkeys would do it
[0:14:43] <AgentZombieMan> @PlagueOfGripes I was gonna be a stupid asshole and suggest you do a Trifusion of Goro from Mortal Kombat, Goro from Persona 5 and Goro from Yakuza.

[0:39:54] <MarylandJutsu> Everytime Plague is on the podcast, he blacks out
[0:40:00] <ThirdStrike_Alex> Yeah during the DMC5 bit I forgot Peach was there for a minute lol
[0:40:05] <jonathandemel> It's weird how unsettling character drawings are when you don't add pupils
[0:40:06] <AgentZombieMan> Oh, absolutely the best guest
[0:40:07] <+wasson_g> personally, i've always found the design of this character atrocious.
[0:40:08] <+daveronald> yes favorite
[0:40:10] <TheIncoherentGamer> @PeachSaliva Your week and "the Domestic" was my favorite parts of the podcast. Dont worry about being too quite you were great
[0:40:31] <+wasson_g> and I like birds.
[0:40:32] <+kewlmyc> Yeah, he's my favorite, though Paige gave him a run for their money.
[0:40:37] <AgentZombieMan> Fuck you Woolie. #ReplaceLiamWithPlague
[0:40:41] <vonmaultke> pvpWhy
[0:40:46] <+Shaggnar> podcast with just 2 people doesn't work as well
[0:40:56] <+Void_The_Dark> ooo, him
[0:40:58] <uncleholly> plague is just a great man.
[0:41:04] <TheIncoherentGamer> GO PLAGUE
[0:41:10] <uncleholly> Such a fucking asshole, but a great man
[0:41:14] <FauxGateau> plague is my spirit animal.
[0:41:38] <SilverRoddo> Blame Woolz for a Plague-less Friendcast, is the take-away. That's what i heard.
[0:41:53] <rakshum> holy shit unca plague and paige, i tuned in good time
[0:41:58] <+techhunter80> woolie's podcast was blessed and saved by plague
[0:42:02] <Coystick> Oh good, the bird girl, nothing can go wrong.
[0:42:29] <VirtuaRailith> I'm the opposite, the internet is the garbage can where I throw my trash
[0:42:42] <SilverRoddo> I love this Eternal Sonata soundtrack Eli is playing in the back ground.
[0:42:58] <Coystick> Explains the length of the Let's Plague episodes
[0:43:09] <TheIncoherentGamer> Woolie does have that problem. Fixing something till it's broken. Most of the time he does stop before that but other times it just a bit too far
[0:43:24] <+Taglog7> Woolie will figure it out
[0:43:32] <MarylandJutsu> one day
[0:43:33] <+greenmistofhyrule> o yay paige
[0:43:41] <TheIncoherentGamer> no time for mister snip snip
[0:44:10] <ehStuGatz> @PeachSaliva have you seen the sonichu version of the poster?
[0:44:19] <SilverRoddo> Sanic spyWhy
[0:44:38] <huangsuave> so this is plague in his element, huh?
[0:44:39] <TheIncoherentGamer> I find the Pikachu one is fine cause they lean into the weirdness
[0:44:43] <+that_guy_from_high_school> have you seen the new sonic poster?
[0:44:46] <Coystick> Gibbs Devito
[0:44:46] <person181> peach can shadow be the goth kid in class in your interpretation
[0:45:02] <+SpaghettiPuncher> Based on the poster, it's awful
[0:45:09] <+UberWolfman> I really hope the movie is one giant meta gag of Eggman makijng a movie to ruin sonic's reputation.
[0:45:22] <nutimik> mono-eye WutFace
[0:45:27] <+TheGenieA1> I think that the movie sonic is going to have two eyes
[0:45:32] <TheIncoherentGamer> I hope it takes itself seriously cause the fire will be greater
[0:45:42] <+TheGenieA1> if there is a monoeye I will have nightmares
[0:46:05] <+Gulping> if they contacted you they'd probably do better. Plague's really good at the sanics
[0:46:07] <+that_guy_from_high_school> the real question is who was asking for a sonic movie?
[0:46:12] <+Gulping> I love fluffy jigglypuff
[0:46:14] <SilverRoddo> Maybe its a fictional poster in-world, and the real Sonic comes in, and critiques the dumb poster.
[0:46:37] <+Gulping> Fluffy jigglypuff is wonderful
[0:47:01] <DonatelloJose> @that_guy_from_high_school The foolish
[0:47:02] <Coystick> What if the white of the monoeye is actually his skull, and his pupils are his eye sockets?
[0:47:21] <+TheGenieA1> headcannon: all live action video game movies take place in the same fucked up universe
[0:47:31] <Coystick> and he just runs around with this gaping wound on his face
[0:47:31] <Mrbaconator> GAZE UPON HIS LEGS
[0:47:32] <TheIncoherentGamer> I was against Jigglypuff at the start. Then I realized how horrible it could have been now I like Jiggly's design
[0:47:32] <nutimik> he moves his eyesockets around?
[0:47:34] <Risingxiv> and mickey mouse gloves
[0:47:53] <SilverRoddo> I want it to be a Who Framed Roger Rabbit? Cel-animated thing.
[0:47:55] <+Gulping> https://i.imgur.com/QKIZV4Y.jpg
[0:48:06] <+Gulping> for reference, an actual hedgehog
[0:48:07] <not_crabby> lol
[0:48:11] <Daxalog> Incredible image
[0:48:15] <Nineless> That's not the picture of the dress.
[0:48:16] <TheIncoherentGamer> that would be good though Silver and I dont think Sonic can be good
[0:48:17] <Risingxiv> I'd want it to be like the Sonic CD opening
[0:48:17] <person181> but that's cool gulping
[0:48:30] <+Gulping> https://i.imgur.com/NePFNCr.jpg
[0:48:30] <Daxalog> But is the dress Yellow? Or Blue?
[0:48:30] <mr_gentleman96> Honestly a Sonic Mania art stykle wouldeat
[0:48:35] <+that_guy_from_high_school> a new poster for the sonic movie https://twitter.com/Wario64/status/1072673476199268352?s=19
[0:48:39] <mr_gentleman96> would be great
[0:48:41] <+wolfeman1911> To be honest, the best idea is to not do it at all.
[0:48:43] <piggypig> the live action sonic looks so horrifying i hate looking at it
[0:48:51] <Blaze33405> jesus christ...
[0:49:02] <Theforgottenregiment> Sonic is not a hedgehog, and never has been one. I don't care what anyone says. He's closer to an alien genetically engineered abomination.
[0:49:05] <Risingxiv> Sonic boom is really nice
[0:49:21] <+Gulping> oh god that's awful, wario
[0:49:24] <Coystick> Do it as a feature length episode of the Mania shorts
[0:49:29] <DonatelloJose> https://imgur.com/gallery/CxHkZcJ
[0:49:30] <+Gulping> or that guy or whatever
[0:49:31] <+Gulping> fuck
[0:49:33] <+that_guy_from_high_school> I don't get why people think the live action version should be the ultimate version of a piece of media.
[0:49:35] <+Gulping> that's horrible
[0:49:37] <TheIncoherentGamer> but Live action thing is in now so you have to do it for the monies
[0:49:44] <+jisang0415> YES MEDLI WON
[0:49:57] <Coystick> Robotnik is the best thing.
[0:50:02] <IntrepidEye> Best thing to do would be like Sonic Unleashed and give the human characters exaggerated Pixar esq designs.
[0:50:14] <person181> is sonics eye poping out in that poster
[0:50:21] <+Gulping> ...his arms are DIFFERENT COLORS.
[0:50:28] <TheIncoherentGamer> Yea seeing Jim Carry acting again. Should be fun
[0:50:42] <+Gulping> oh wait no, no, no
[0:50:47] <Huntercd> They should just have a real hedgehog
[0:50:53] <Coystick> No cheating in 3D
[0:50:56] <+Gulping> he's blue to mid-bicep, then he's tan
[0:50:57] <DonatelloJose> Would... Would they have the gull/ball to cast knuckles as an African american child?
[0:51:05] <+5Two> That's no good.
[0:51:08] <Risingxiv> they could of made the eyes like a 2d or animated texture
[0:51:14] <nutimik> I don't know about Jim Carrey anymore, he's gone nuts the last few years
[0:51:29] <+mistersokar> Just give him sunglasses so you avoid the whole eye mess
[0:51:30] <person181> just give him a blue mowhowk
[0:51:34] <Coystick> What if he had retractable eye stalks like a snail?
[0:51:36] <Theforgottenregiment> Live action adaptations are completely pointless most of the time, but Hollywood thinks real life humans are the best for everything, soooo...
[0:51:47] <Huntercd> Just use a real hedghog
[0:51:48] <ehStuGatz> isn't Jim Carrey's girlfriend the reason he went insane
[0:51:56] <%Freonade> Why does Sonic have muscle!?
[0:52:04] <+kewlmyc> It is
[0:52:05] <+aialy> he finna go fast.
[0:52:10] <+that_guy_from_high_school> Paramount
[0:52:11] <Risingxiv> I already know whats gonna happen in the movie, Cringe and many more cringe
[0:52:12] <LixFury> MURICA
[0:52:13] <+All_Salt> Paramount Pictures
[0:52:15] <nutimik> live action is also exponentially less expensive than 3d animation and especially 2d animation
[0:52:18] <Coystick> Sonic voiced by Tom Hardy
[0:52:24] <+MagickBurritoh> Is he gonna have the side mouth?
[0:52:31] <DonatelloJose> Oh no....
[0:52:33] <+Gulping> Well to monster hunter's credit, Tony Jaa is just a videogame character
[0:52:37] <person181> because animation is expensive right?
[0:52:44] <nutimik> yea it is
[0:52:44] <+kewlmyc> No it's Paramount
[0:52:45] <+that_guy_from_high_school> oh boy its get better and better.
[0:52:46] <sec0nd_impact> it's the fast and the furious guys
[0:52:46] <Theforgottenregiment> True, true. Still don't like it. :V
[0:52:54] <TheIncoherentGamer> good sign
[0:52:55] <+Gulping> Like he's in the full armor he has the big ridiculous sword made of bone
[0:52:58] <Coystick> It'll be an interesting Half in the Bag at least.
[0:53:09] <Huntercd> Oh no
[0:53:09] <VirtuaRailith> Sonic in Star Trek
[0:53:10] <Piemono> Oh boy
[0:53:10] <TheIncoherentGamer> more good sign
[0:53:15] <Zaphire_Saucypants> Oof
[0:53:18] <Coystick> Sonic at night.
[0:53:32] <+greenmistofhyrule> oof
[0:53:32] <OrangeGameCinema> SPOILERS: Sonic runs
[0:53:40] <rakshum> radioactive chilidog
[0:53:45] <piggypig> hearing this hurts me physically
[0:53:46] <TheIncoherentGamer> finger crossed for chili dog
[0:53:56] <SlayrideTwinsinner> Robotnik is gonna be Jim Carrey
[0:53:56] <+Shaggnar> I want it to be so bad that you can't tell if it's self aware or not
[0:53:58] <+aialy> Animorphs.
[0:54:00] <SlayrideTwinsinner> Which is hilarious
[0:54:00] <+Gulping> Orbot and Cubot
[0:54:05] <nutimik> It's a track runner bitten by a radioactive eyeball
[0:54:07] <+Void_The_Dark> Sega even remember Grounder and Scratch?
[0:54:11] <Theforgottenregiment> There better be a PINGAS reference.
[0:54:11] <DonatelloJose> would they reference as far back as Sally over Amy? Kids these day have no idea who Sally is.
[0:54:13] <SlayrideTwinsinner> I may watch it just for Jim Carrey
[0:54:17] <VirtuaRailith> Paige's terrible move sounds too watchable
[0:54:22] <+that_guy_from_high_school> The cube and the ball. both represent pat.
[0:54:23] <piggypig> cant wait for the sonichu reference
[0:54:24] <hypecactuar> Plague!!!!
[0:54:27] <Coystick> Wait Jim Carrey is robotnik?
[0:54:28] <OrangeGameCinema> @Theforgottenregiment They already referenced that in the sonic boom series
[0:54:34] <@Nightbot> Plague is a youtube animator and also streams at https://picarto.tv/Plague . Also: t-shirts! http://goo.gl/lze8QO
[0:54:35] <+wasson_g> Jaleal White better be in the movie.
[0:54:38] <person181> can shadow be the goth bad boy who in this
[0:54:40] <Theforgottenregiment> Oh really? Haha!
[0:54:40] <PunishedRaccoon> hi plague and peach
[0:54:44] <cherubsanonymous> "He's the faster....."
[0:54:57] <VirtuaRailith> I think the Sonic movie will just be the horrible Woody Woodpecker movie but with Sonic instead of Woody Woodpecker
[0:54:59] <Daxalog> Robotnik has a power ring factory. Grounder/Scatch knocks off a ring off a conveyer belt which kicks it all of
[0:55:01] <TheIncoherentGamer> I disagree about no Shadow he's to popular. like he might just be background
[0:55:01] <Theforgottenregiment> Can't wait for Chris-chan's reaction to the live action movie.
[0:55:04] <+NirvashTypeMQ> plaguee streams??
[0:55:05] <OrangeGameCinema> It should be based of the Sonic '06 story
[0:55:07] <SilverRoddo> I hope this Sonic movie is the gateway to more animal humanoid films.
[0:55:07] <Huntercd> Is Paige better from the Sadness?
[0:55:12] <+that_guy_from_high_school> the last thing I saw was Psyched
[0:55:13] <+mistersokar> @PlagueOfGripes just saw him a few days ago at Steel City Con
[0:55:17] <+wasson_g> >Jaleal White >is black
[0:55:25] <+wasson_g> honestly now.
[0:55:26] <nutimik> zoinks
[0:55:29] <Raconteur999> he did that game show in the dark
[0:55:32] <OrangeGameCinema> @NirvashTypeMQ ikr i was surprised too
[0:55:37] <Coystick> Scooby Doo cross Sonic wen?
[0:55:41] <DonatelloJose> Jeepers...
[0:55:44] <SilverRoddo> Frank Black is white.
[0:55:53] <+5Two> All I want to see is a robot baby fall to earth and explode
[0:55:53] <+wasson_g> my god...
[0:56:10] <masterdodo15> bird chick won
[0:56:12] <+UberWolfman> Whens the SoniChu movie?
[0:56:14] <OrangeGameCinema> A sexual wink
[0:56:15] <+that_guy_from_high_school> a wet dream paige.
[0:56:15] <+Shaggnar> Oh at some point Sonic will make out with an actual human girl. That is happening.
[0:56:16] <Coystick> Felate that meat
[0:56:17] <TheIncoherentGamer> Welp bed time for me. Can't wait to see the Drawing in the morning. Have a goodnight everyone
[0:56:18] <+Ell1ot> i'm confused. where's the star trek?
[0:56:18] <+Gulping> He's just going to gulp the fucker down
[0:56:22] <Piemono> SONIC WHY
[0:56:26] <Coystick> Like a goose
[0:56:28] <+Gulping> SOLD
[0:56:29] <T_Sasquatch> ahhhh face cam , ahhh paige
[0:56:29] <VirtuaRailith> 1000% Soinc will kiss a human
[0:56:34] <Daxalog> Hell say Damn
[0:56:36] <person181> but how will the chaos emeralds work into the plot?
[0:56:39] <forgetme000> EEP DOG
[0:56:39] <DonatelloJose> Fred says fuck.
[0:56:40] <OrangeGameCinema> He says fuck Mario. Like how robin said fuck batman
[0:56:45] <nutimik> while showing his shiny gold cockring
[0:56:55] <+wasson_g> they need a ChrisChan movie with full epic CGI ready player one style sonichu scenes.
[0:56:57] <+that_guy_from_high_school> no
[0:57:04] <+5Two> That has to be reserved for Shadow
[0:57:12] <AgentZombieMan> @OrangeGameCinema Then shoots Robotnik in the face with a Shotgun'
[0:57:13] <piggypig> theres going to be a "sega does what nintendont" reference in there
[0:57:19] <Piemono> In Bruce Almighty they get a fuck in
[0:57:21] <+kewlmyc> She says "goddamn" not fuck
[0:57:23] <BillieNoMates> Should have been maggy
[0:57:26] <nutimik> shoulda been santa's little helper
[0:57:29] <+that_guy_from_high_school> you can have 1 fuck in a non literal way. you can't say motherfucker.
[0:57:38] <+Void_The_Dark> Should of been Bumble Bee man
[0:57:41] <Coystick> Paige, language please.
[0:57:41] <+kewlmyc> I can show you the clip
[0:57:43] <DonatelloJose> is fuck tier two?
[0:57:44] <+wasson_g> It should have just been Barney belching "Fuck" at the end of the credits.
[0:57:46] <ScarletVenture> Fred says fuck
[0:57:48] <HiddenPorpoise> no one said fuck
[0:57:48] <suikudo> PAIGEY TALK?!
[0:57:49] <nutimik> I'm pretty sure she doesn't tho
[0:57:54] <Black_Storme> just look it up on youtube.
[0:57:54] <DonatelloJose> HE DOES NOT
[0:58:00] <%Sewphee> 10,000% fuck.
[0:58:02] <SilverRoddo> It will be a smart move if Sonic gives advice, and tells them "its no good".
[0:58:07] <DoubleDurian> Marge doesn't say fuck, she just tweets alt-right content
[0:58:10] <T_Sasquatch> you're related to pat so you're probably wrong
[0:58:13] <nutimik> half the time he's on picarto instead though
[0:58:14] <%Gogogolem> @PlagueOfGripes Plague this is free for me so fuck it take it.
[0:58:24] <vonmaultke> LUL
[0:58:31] <+wasson_g> sonic gives advice and says "underage smoking?? THATS just FUCKED."
[0:58:34] <+Shaggnar> Plague doesn't stream regularly enough for me to sub rooFeels
[0:58:37] <+kewlmyc> https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c9tx0o2MLMU
[0:58:40] <BillieNoMates> Twitch subs are like a 50% cut as opposed to 20% off Patreon?
[0:58:46] <SlayrideTwinsinner> I just do like $1 a thing cause it's what I can afford right now.
[0:58:48] <OrangeGameCinema> The movie better end with a sonic sez
[0:58:58] <EmeraldSage> live action adaptations can be done right even with hyper realism , but the way these directors or whatever executives are doing it is what makes it seem like it cant be done. But from what i've witnessed it seems it's directors putting their own terrible fanfic in the story or are just straight ignorant of the franchise they were hired to represent.
[0:59:01] <SlayrideTwinsinner> If I had the income I'd do more.
[0:59:12] <AgentZombieMan> To be fair, sometimes you're doing well then BOOM! Gas tank starts leaking and takes a $600 bat to your account
[0:59:16] <cherubsanonymous> I hope SO
[0:59:16] <nutimik> people aren't allowed to say how big the cut is from subs
[0:59:17] <SilverRoddo> I wish Twitch allowed subs through the Apple store and not just bits.
[0:59:21] <Piemono> Marge is part of the Proud Boys
[0:59:23] <BillieNoMates> I'd like to see more openess from companies in the recieving party.
[0:59:36] <CherryLambo> What about them Sonic heads?
[0:59:38] <nutimik> hard to resist the urge to normalise the proportions
[0:59:40] <DonatelloJose> "Meth isn't as bad as you'd think. It helps me go fast" Sonic 2019
[0:59:42] <nutimik> I get that
[0:59:53] <suikudo> Its a beak nose
[0:59:58] <OrangeGameCinema> Its a bill nose
[0:59:58] <nutimik> Yea the beak bothers me so much
[0:59:59] <vladtet909> Pseudo realism.
[1:00:02] <Coystick> Your whole thing is those glorious variably thick lines.
[1:00:02] <suikudo> her mouth is normal
[1:00:04] <nutimik> can she open the beak?
[1:00:10] <+Gulping> Twitch can't get their site working more than 40% of the time
[1:00:10] <+UberWolfman> shes a good girl
[1:00:12] <+wasson_g> it's a prosthetic she wears...after the accident.
[1:00:15] <Raconteur999> I have no money, so my "support" is coloring line art
[1:00:16] <+Termoil313> HONKER SabaPing
[1:00:17] <Coystick> She's a failed FEV subject
[1:00:20] <nutimik> So it's just a terrible nose
[1:00:28] <+Termoil313> SabaPing H O N K E R SabaPing
[1:00:42] <OrangeGameCinema> Their nose is for attracting mates
[1:00:49] <+Gulping> how the fuck is patreon going to get a live streaming platform when a company that's worth almost as much as russia can't do it
[1:00:52] <+someone_unkwon1> wow, this is my first time seeing plague IRL. is it offensive to say he looks a bit like Pat?
[1:00:53] <+Fontaime> QUACK
[1:00:55] <harraceharrison> The great Rito Noseaggedon
[1:00:57] <+Termoil313> SabaPing Grant us HONKERS SabaPing
[1:01:02] <Coystick> It goes flush during mating season
[1:01:02] <+UberWolfman> Yeah they were Zora!
[1:01:02] <nutimik> learn me sensei
[1:01:10] <Coystick> lore
[1:01:11] <editorsebas> fish evolved into birds
[1:01:12] <+Gulping> Maybe just draw her head like she's a BotW rito
[1:01:17] <+Gulping> so just a bird
[1:01:18] <+greenmistofhyrule> birds from fish
[1:01:18] <DonatelloJose> The planet flooded? BETTER EVOLVE TO GROW WINGS
[1:01:24] <SlayrideTwinsinner> Yeah cause the sage for her people was a Zora
[1:01:29] <+wasson_g> i'd love to play windwaker some day...they gonna put it on switch?
[1:01:36] <OrangeGameCinema> Close! They were the fish people but they evolved into the bird people after hyrule was flooded. Try me im a zelda expert
[1:01:39] <SlayrideTwinsinner> So when she learns from them that's how you find out
[1:01:41] <DoubleDurian> Can they fly?, do they lay eggs?
[1:01:43] <BillieNoMates> Nah. They just had bird fetishes
[1:01:45] <Huntercd> The Goddess sound like dicks
[1:01:47] <reonome> oh paige is here
[1:01:47] <SlayrideTwinsinner> They can fly.
[1:01:50] <SlayrideTwinsinner> And yes they lay eggs
[1:01:51] <Raconteur999> something said it cursed the oceans, so they couldn't stay in the water
[1:01:51] <BillieNoMates> And wanted dat cloaca
[1:01:54] <SlayrideTwinsinner> Cause Zora laid eggs
[1:01:54] <+greenmistofhyrule> but why birds if so much water?
[1:01:55] <Piemono> Why would you go from being a fish person to a bird person in Water World?
[1:01:58] <ThirdStrike_Alex> It’s in the game. Someone straight up says it
[1:02:03] <Futurecity10> The Kokiri are the same, they just changed form
[1:02:07] <+that_guy_from_high_school> yes so the fish people were turned into birds when the world flooded?
[1:02:09] <SlayrideTwinsinner> Yep
[1:02:09] <harraceharrison> Koroks are fine but I don't like how the ones in BotW look IDENTICAL to the ones from WW
[1:02:13] <SlayrideTwinsinner> Korkiri changed
[1:02:15] <SilverRoddo> Spores, from outer space, that's how they evolved.
[1:02:22] <vladtet909> Forest sprites
[1:02:28] <AgentZombieMan> Your face is lost in time
[1:02:30] <ThirdStrike_Alex> They literally meet their ancestor spirit and it’s a Zora
[1:02:39] <+Gulping> Yeah, now they're the Koroks because they lost their hand privileges
[1:02:39] <OrangeGameCinema> Since everything was flooded ya thing it wouldve been a good idea to stay being a fish :/
[1:02:40] <Futurecity10> They were always forest sprites, who can change forms
[1:02:53] <+Gulping> Koroks are no longer allowed to have hands
[1:03:30] <Raconteur999> for the third time, cursed ocean water
[1:03:32] <+Gulping> Like they're troublesome enough as is do you want them to have actual dextrous goddamn hands
[1:03:35] <forgetme000> he little tree goblin things?
[1:03:36] <ThirdStrike_Alex> Peach likes the little children in the woods more
[1:03:37] <HiddenPorpoise> They are like that in WW because there is nothing to copy so they just turn back into twigs
[1:03:55] <+Gulping> Do you have any idea what that would unleash
[1:03:57] <Futurecity10> Kinda like that Breath is so out there that its its own timeline
[1:04:03] <BillieNoMates> Wait. Plague actually leaves his farm?
[1:04:15] <+Shaggnar> oof
[1:04:23] <+Gulping> Breath is the endpoint of every timeline reunified by egregious use of the Magic Goddamn Triangles
[1:04:27] <Zaphire_Saucypants> ouch
[1:04:35] <FauxGateau> remember how breath has that convo that says it's three different timelines that merged?
[1:04:36] <+wasson_g> traveler from another dimension.
[1:04:41] <+greenmistofhyrule> paige no remember
[1:04:44] <T_Sasquatch> yikes LUL

[1:04:53] <OrangeGameCinema> Internet troll?
[1:04:59] <person181> this is why i never got to know anyone
[1:05:01] <FauxGateau> hey dude im right there with you
[1:05:07] <Futurecity10> Breath was an okay game, but was an aweful zelda game
[1:05:08] <ScarletVenture> The true timeline is that every game is a dream and Link's Awakening is the meta-canon.
[1:05:09] <FauxGateau> nintendo is just having a laugh
[1:05:27] <+MisterTylerrr> Hello y'all
[1:05:42] <BillieNoMates> He was trying to seduce you
[1:05:47] <+Gulping> some jackass wanted to clear up the timeline confusion and they used the Triforce to do it and everything got jacked up. Again.
[1:05:48] <nutimik> a good friend with a terrible memory
[1:05:58] <EmeraldSage> But you mean so much plague D:
[1:06:03] <+wasson_g> he was just doing the normie thing where they over exaggerat being friendly
[1:06:06] <OrangeGameCinema> He was just having a minor episode of severe paranoid schizophrenia
[1:06:07] <ehStuGatz> next time Plague's on the podcast he's gonna be going "who the fuck are you people"
[1:06:09] <FauxGateau> plague helped me out once.
[1:06:11] <vonmaultke> LUL "he cares about me or something" - Plague of gripes
[1:06:17] <nutimik> he wasn't hairy enough to get in plague's pants
[1:06:24] <Theforgottenregiment> "I'm a great friend... when I remember who my friends are."
[1:06:24] <Futurecity10> Paige, you still mind broken from yesterday sbfpRichard
[1:06:26] <+MisterTylerrr> Hi Plague, Hey Peach! You were great on the podcast, Paige.
[1:06:27] <piggypig> plague is a handsome devil, wouldnt suprise me if strangers at walmart would hit him up
[1:06:37] <+Gulping> Do they have to build your fence
[1:06:38] <nutimik> he's an old spinster
[1:06:49] <+jorgamund> plague requires VERY sexy pokemon Kappa
[1:07:02] <%Sewphee> Plague is too wise to fuck.
[1:07:03] <+Gulping> do they have to come over with some tools and whatever the fuck you're making the damn thing out of
[1:07:04] <Coystick> SageOfGripes
[1:07:09] <ChortlesJ1> Oh great, even his Medii is turning out beautiful
[1:07:15] <+UberWolfman> and other questionable ladies.
[1:07:21] <person181> cuz they can be anything
[1:07:21] <+Shaggnar> Eevee is the best, that's why
[1:07:21] <OrangeGameCinema> Sexy pokemon, thats a bit redundant
[1:07:23] <hectoriglesiasbenavides> who wouldnt want to seduce palgue
[1:07:25] <+modmanawesome69> im 21 and on grindr, im allowed to make stupid decisions, PLAGUE patDab
[1:07:29] <Coystick> Whats the plant one with the thorn between her tits?
[1:07:29] <+MisterTylerrr> I've been saying for years, Plague is a handsome mother fucker. Thought so ever since his Patreon video
[1:07:29] <Mr_Strut> Eevees are very malleable.
[1:07:29] <ehStuGatz> plague has accidentally given himself several VERY specific fetishes
[1:07:30] <AgentZombieMan> ... Fuck talk about Bad Memory...
[1:07:42] <valanway_diabolos> Eevees can be *anything*
[1:07:47] <nutimik> peach into eevees confirmed
[1:07:50] <%EpicBigchill> @PlagueOfGripes in the animation you said that eevees were very popular
[1:07:51] <HiddenPorpoise> Plague, you literally drew a mountain of dead eevees
[1:07:53] <nutimik> tiny like pat
[1:07:54] <OrangeGameCinema> Eevees go both ways
[1:07:57] <AgentZombieMan> In the video there was a specific bit about "The Eevee's are particularly popular"
[1:08:03] <AgentZombieMan> IN YOUR VIDEO
[1:08:09] <+jorgamund> @PlagueOfGripes does the talking actually distract you from the drawing, or does it help with the flow like the music does?
[1:08:15] <+Gulping> there was a specific mention of the eeveelutions yes
[1:08:18] <Mr_Strut> The lewd incantation
[1:08:24] <+Gulping> plague the fence wizard
[1:08:25] <%Sewphee> Boner Wizard
[1:08:31] <person181> this just goes to show how bad his memory is
[1:08:40] <+MisterTylerrr> *Watches Plague's Patreon announcement video* Oh no, he's hot!
[1:08:45] <DonatelloJose> A big hat Logan hat.
[1:08:52] <T_Sasquatch> wizard hat LUL
[1:08:56] <Mr_Strut> The grand wizard you might say
[1:09:01] <OrangeGameCinema> plague confirmed dilf
[1:09:05] <+jorgamund> Mouseketeers, disavow!
[1:09:17] <person181> talk about how bad karas story was
[1:09:23] <DonatelloJose> bumbled her way right into the best ending.
[1:09:29] <ehStuGatz> Peach also learned how people get bits last night
[1:09:31] <Futurecity10> I dont understand
[1:09:38] <DigDugRug> Draw her with big freaking tiddie
[1:09:45] <Huntercd> Fuck David Cage
[1:09:46] <+wasson_g> "I put on my robe and wizard hat" haha who remembers?
[1:09:49] <+greenmistofhyrule> I don't understand
[1:09:52] <%Sewphee> Oh Paige, I've just started watching your Bloodborne LP, cause you been making me laugh on the Plague streams.
[1:10:00] <Futurecity10> Detriot is a better game if you die scene one
[1:10:03] <Futurecity10> with kara
[1:10:05] <%Sewphee> They're good fun.
[1:10:09] <DoubleDurian> cara's storyline is the hatian earthquake of bad writing.
[1:10:19] <+wasson_g> Up with Johnny Cage.
[1:10:23] <+wasson_g> Down with David Cage.
[1:10:27] <AgentZombieMan> JOHNNY CAGE
[1:10:35] <Daxalog> Kara entire story is just "What do "normal" androids have to deal with"
[1:10:40] <FauxGateau> going down with david cage
[1:10:47] <Raconteur999> Yahtzee sums up the pointlessness of Kara, We knew that robots can love robots at the brothel
[1:10:51] <T_Sasquatch> Wouldn't it have been better if you knew she was a robot and you test players on how they treat her knowing she is a robot
[1:10:56] <vonmaultke> plotholes are increasing pvpS
[1:10:58] <FauxGateau> that'd be cool
[1:11:02] <+KaizenChaos> Fat evil ripped it out
[1:11:13] <+wasson_g> never played that game...but hearing a synapsis of it reminds me why i nuked the androids in fallout 4.
[1:11:29] <+MisterTylerrr> A lot of things in the game are well executed, None of them are in Kara's gameplay
[1:11:31] <+modmanawesome69> same with fucking RA9
[1:11:32] <person181> "frustration getting bigger"-karas story
[1:11:38] <+modmanawesome69> and how nothing comes out of that
[1:11:41] <+greenmistofhyrule> cumski
[1:11:46] <ehStuGatz> the Harkness test?
[1:11:47] <+wasson_g> the Noam Chomski test...
[1:11:48] <vonmaultke> The Harkness test Kreygasm
[1:11:58] <Jontman42> I think there was a mention somewhere that the child models aren't required to have one necessarily.
[1:12:08] <T_Sasquatch> OwO cumski
[1:12:12] <FauxGateau> child models don't have the lcd yeah
[1:12:17] <+jorgamund> "hey guys, I put a backdoor in all the androis!" And nobody thinks it's important enough to follow up with him
[1:12:19] <EmeraldSage> android 21 is best girl
[1:12:20] <FauxGateau> just to keep your immersion i guess
[1:12:41] <DoubleDurian> David Cage is the Hatian Earthquake of game directors.
[1:12:51] <forgetme000> in the gallery it says that you can buy the alice bots without without the LEDs
[1:12:51] <Ginsan31> yo Plague and chat
[1:12:54] <%Sewphee> Time to get ready for work, have a good strem.
[1:12:57] <DonatelloJose> the uncanny valley of not being able to detect that an android is an android is what they were trying to talk about.
[1:13:05] <+wasson_g> @DoubleDurian lol
[1:13:18] <+MisterTylerrr> It's HORRIBLY on the nose
[1:13:29] <Laecerelius> Kamski doesn't even give you any useful information if you do it
[1:13:36] <T_Sasquatch> the game itself has already made its decision that robots are people
[1:13:36] <+wasson_g> you'd think le french could be le subtle n'shit.
[1:13:44] <cherubsanonymous> "Good things are good and bad things are bad, I am great writer!"
[1:13:51] <+wasson_g> but non.
[1:13:52] <FauxGateau> ha french are never subtle
[1:14:03] <Andele1503> Just shoot the robot, if his test is correct the android girl would be begging you to not shoot her , but no she is a toaster
[1:14:19] <Raconteur999> you choose what you ask, it's your mistake if you asked a worthless question, but he'll give you the boat name
[1:14:24] <+wasson_g> actually yeah, the french cannot into subtlety.
[1:14:29] <Laecerelius> I think that his androids are like an old model that is incapable of going deviant or something like that
[1:14:31] <ECRead> slap that toaster
[1:14:31] <person181> it turns from child abuse to property damage
[1:14:43] <ehStuGatz> it's like punching a speedbag with your kid's face on it
[1:14:48] <T_Sasquatch> you don't beat your devices Kappa
[1:14:50] <Coystick> She's a daughter realdoll to him
[1:14:53] <Theforgottenregiment> David Cage is the Tommy Wiseau of game directors.
[1:14:53] <harraceharrison> Fat evil to dumb evil
[1:14:56] <FauxGateau> would you really punch a toaster because your wife left you due to robots?
[1:15:00] <+jorgamund> ok, but legit psych question: how is that a BAD way for a man that broken to cope with his problems? Are drugs and confinement better?
[1:15:01] <DonatelloJose> Better to take you anger out on the scapegoat little girl android then an actual person, at least from his perspective.
[1:15:02] <vladtet909> David Cage is about as subtle as flashing sign with his ambiguity.
[1:15:06] <Theforgottenregiment> Maybe the Neil Breen of game directors, I dunno.
[1:15:06] <ECRead> i might
[1:15:11] <+wasson_g> David Cage is the Telltale Interactive of...wait..
[1:15:19] <AgentZombieMan> Dude, if the Detriot Universe, Robo-Pedophilia would be RAMPANT
[1:15:19] <FauxGateau> too soon
[1:15:27] <Daxalog> For the single moms who cant compete I guess?
[1:15:28] <+MisterTylerrr> Like Baby Ashley?
[1:15:30] <ProRJHunter> Remember Detroit has no meaning at all.
[1:15:31] <FauxGateau> but would anyone care?
[1:15:42] <FauxGateau> probably not.
[1:15:42] <T_Sasquatch> you KNOW why they make those dolls
[1:15:42] <Huntercd> Those reborn dolls
[1:15:45] <Huntercd> eww
[1:15:45] <harraceharrison> Does Pat still have that?
[1:15:54] <person181> @ProRJHunter the game about nothing
[1:15:54] <editorsebas> Does Pat still have baby Ashley?
[1:15:58] <Kemmybelle> ind of like baby Ashley
[1:15:59] <FauxGateau> he better
[1:16:03] <ScarletVenture> Oh, you mean the horror movie dolls
[1:16:04] <vonmaultke> Thats messed up
[1:16:05] <+wasson_g> Reborn dolls?
[1:16:14] <Theforgottenregiment> The Doll Reborn.
[1:16:15] <AgentZombieMan> Here ya go: https://www.etsy.com/listing/629267298/custom-order-very-realistic-newborn-baby Wanna be creeped the fuck out?
[1:16:17] <+wasson_g> that reminds me of Reboot.
[1:16:28] <EmeraldSage> lol omg
[1:16:29] <$atlasbot1> plague talking about his childhood
[1:16:32] <DoubleDurian> Realistic Infant dolls are the Hatian Earthquake of copping mechanisms
[1:16:33] <FunkyRot> mondo kek
[1:16:33] <+MisterTylerrr> Primates have ODD parenting techniques
[1:16:35] <FauxGateau> that makes sense to me
[1:16:36] <+greenmistofhyrule> fuck em
[1:16:37] <Andele1503> ITS NOT SAD, its ugly
[1:16:37] <person181> but why though?
[1:16:39] <T_Sasquatch> LUL
[1:16:40] <+Taglog7> fuk gorillas?
[1:16:41] <+0ni0n_L0rd> But a woman losing their child and seeking comfort in a doll isn't?
[1:16:45] <+modmanawesome69> That is the worst link i've clicked in weeks thanks @AgentZombieMan
[1:16:46] <DonatelloJose> they have limited consciousness. who cares? /s

[1:16:58] <OrangeGameCinema> When I die I wanna be turned into a helicopter drone
[1:17:04] <+blazymaniac> but hilarious to think about
[1:17:07] <+wasson_g> funny. it's funny.
[1:17:21] <+wasson_g> it's a stuffed cat with a drone apparatus attached.
[1:17:31] <ehStuGatz> @OrangeGameCinema only if you're T-posing
[1:17:33] <ECRead> LUL
[1:17:35] <vonmaultke> LUL
[1:17:35] <Mr_Strut> If you're gonna do it, why half ass it?
[1:17:38] <+wasson_g> STROGG CAT.
[1:17:40] <+0ni0n_L0rd> No DO do that
[1:17:42] <Raconteur999> with fans to maximize the spread
[1:17:44] <+0ni0n_L0rd> Do it all the time
[1:17:48] <+0ni0n_L0rd> Never NOT do that
[1:17:51] <korg1b> ay yo, give me tew pairs i need tew pears
[1:17:53] <+jorgamund> such strict morals
[1:17:56] <Mr_Strut> Turn your pet into a transformer
[1:17:57] <AgentZombieMan> @PeachSaliva I shared the horrifying creepy realistic baby doll
[1:18:12] <FauxGateau> actually never mind im into it now.
[1:18:17] <LordLicoriceDerp> When I die, I want my skin to be preserved and attached to a drone like a flappy horror-cloak, so it just floats behind the drone. FWIPWIPWIPWIPW
[1:18:30] <LordLicoriceDerp> The Blood-Starved Drone
[1:18:53] <JoeNeutrino> @LordLicoriceDerp My thought exactly
[1:19:02] <Mr_Strut> Time a huge bitch
[1:19:06] <+wasson_g> poor pooch.
[1:19:16] <+hawk_rush> oh boy, medli!! Hi @PlagueOfGripes
[1:19:23] <+0ni0n_L0rd> Yeah maybe take him other places than the vet that are nice
[1:19:34] <+Shaggnar> Take him to the park
[1:19:47] <harraceharrison> At the vet: "Why is your cats face covered in ice cream"
[1:19:54] <person181> take him for walks
[1:19:59] <+Ell1ot> tell Elmo to stop being a butt
[1:20:05] <ChortlesJ1> Plague and Peach talking about cats is a big deja vu
[1:20:08] <mortelkilll> cats dont really take "walks"
[1:20:10] <+wasson_g> ayyyy who else had that Pure Funk cd?
[1:20:11] <+0ni0n_L0rd> Dogs > Cats > Small Dogs
[1:20:19] <mortelkilll> if you get yoru cat out on the leach its not gonan go really far
[1:20:36] <DonatelloJose> this music is bumping.
[1:20:43] <mortelkilll> my cat doesnt even leave the fron t of the house and just sleep there
[1:20:51] <Raconteur999> but pets can't possibly understand that you're the one driving, controlling the destination, Cars are just a weird box that sometimes go to parks and sometimes go to vets
[1:20:56] <Mr_Strut> And then Plague saw Callie Briggs
[1:21:01] <+Probliterator> Thanks for re-tweeting cat images Eli, it's always nice to look at my phone during the day and seeing that.
[1:21:07] <keiji_maede> lol

[1:21:59] <LordLicoriceDerp> The bathtub would turn into a flesh slurry cocktail
[1:21:59] <BillieNoMates> I just came back to Elmo scratching your boobs
[1:22:04] <$atlasbot1> Peepee
[1:22:09] <JoeNeutrino> Get a claw stuck in your nipple and just rip it right off.
[1:22:11] <+Probliterator> muh BOY

[1:22:50] <AgentZombieMan> Hands? What's wrong with Hands?
[1:22:54] <+Shaggnar> Feet are indeed creepy as fuck
[1:22:57] <AgentZombieMan> Anus
[1:22:59] <mortelkilll> animl bodies didnt develop for esthetic
[1:23:04] <+greenmistofhyrule> mouths
[1:23:08] <forgetme000> the left the right and the holy dong
[1:23:09] <skelfae> FEET
[1:23:10] <mortelkilll> probably the mouth
[1:23:10] <person181> genitals no question
[1:23:13] <Futurecity10> Gooch
[1:23:13] <AgentZombieMan> Taint
[1:23:13] <ehStuGatz> belly button
[1:23:14] <Ultimatrium> bellybutton
[1:23:15] <vonmaultke> Teeth
[1:23:17] <LordLicoriceDerp> The brain, it makes you think of bad things, like spider buttholes
[1:23:19] <FauxGateau> these are babie answers
[1:23:21] <piggypig> the coochie
[1:23:21] <editorsebas> ears are creepy
[1:23:22] <+modmanawesome69> Ears
[1:23:23] <Coystick> I hate the spine
[1:23:25] <AgentZombieMan> @vonmaultke You okay?
[1:23:26] <+0ni0n_L0rd> No such thing, the whole human body is beautiful. You people are weird.
[1:23:27] <TheAsylumCat> nose
[1:23:30] <mortelkilll> in almost every animal, the mouth is horrifying to look at
[1:23:30] <+NirvashTypeMQ> tonsil stones
[1:23:31] <+greenmistofhyrule> ewww belly buttons
[1:23:38] <Raconteur999> unbent elbows
[1:23:40] <+wasson_g> "Human Buttholes"
[1:23:41] <+TheGenieA1> wtf is this
[1:23:42] <DonatelloJose> The more you know Jingle****
[1:23:47] <+TheGenieA1> conversation
[1:23:49] <FauxGateau> human body is just a chemical scented meat suit. it's awesome.
[1:23:52] <+hawk_rush> belly buttons are a gateway into your body, they're fucking weird
[1:23:54] <Mr_Strut> Pretty soon the police will identify people by their buttholes
[1:23:56] <+wasson_g> I heard you can surf those.
[1:24:07] <EmeraldSage> lmao XD
[1:24:08] <vonmaultke> @AgentZombieMan its fine to look at but its bone piercing your face, its weird
[1:24:11] <$Captain_Krunk> Be thankful we're not one of them kind of sea creatures where their mouth is located in their butthole X_X
[1:24:13] <AgentZombieMan> My toenails are pretty bad, specifically
[1:24:26] <+greenmistofhyrule> belly buttons are up there
[1:24:28] <BillieNoMates> Plague habitually removes his teeth
[1:24:30] <Mr_Strut> How many things are we going to exclude?
[1:24:33] <Daxalog> Teeth roots are the worst
[1:24:34] <mortelkilll> well the teeth are gross by purpose
[1:24:34] <FauxGateau> ooo yeah teeth are bad
[1:24:35] <harraceharrison> Why don't you like your meat hole full of bone spurs plague
[1:24:38] <+Draylle> teeth are sensitive little bitches
[1:24:39] <TheAsylumCat> noses are fucking weird
[1:24:40] <+Bacon_Rage> human teeth are trash
[1:24:46] <mortelkilll> the teets very concept is to chew down living beings
[1:24:48] <+greenmistofhyrule> teeth suck
[1:24:49] <$Captain_Krunk> Agreed, rotting food in your mouth is the worst. Teeth tend to keep those LUL
[1:24:56] <mortelkilll> so yeah teeths are logically creepy
[1:24:59] <+Shaggnar> You ever really look at an iris, it's really weird
[1:25:08] <FauxGateau> don't like looking at them or thinking about them.
[1:25:21] <Daxalog> Specifically floss?
[1:25:21] <OrangeGameCinema> i dont floss ever
[1:25:26] <$Captain_Krunk> You need to get a water pic
[1:25:27] <Theforgottenregiment> The pelvis is unnerving.
[1:25:32] <AgentZombieMan> I've got some jacked to shit teeth'
[1:25:35] <+0ni0n_L0rd> >Japan smells like piss
[1:25:38] <FauxGateau> please floss everyone.
[1:25:38] <$Captain_Krunk> Water pics make flossing a lot easier
[1:25:42] <LordLicoriceDerp> I have to use those eco-unfriendly plackers things, it's the only way to get into my back teeth
[1:25:47] <+greenmistofhyrule> im disabled I agree with paige stale piss is gross
[1:25:54] <mortelkilll> the human body has plenty of of weird parts that are pretty bad at their job
[1:25:56] <T_Sasquatch> I've never been to a dentist LUL
[1:26:00] <Theforgottenregiment> I've heard that too.
[1:26:05] <Pyr0_Fr0st> And yet society has found it perfectly aceptable to put others people genitalia in their mouth
[1:26:11] <+wasson_g> ...that sounds dumb af tbh.
[1:26:12] <+Lorps> im so glad to finally see plagues face. i want to lick the top of his head and give a loving smack on it
[1:26:13] <$Captain_Krunk> Be warned, you are going to smell the most disgusting thing ever when you do water pic floss. But that's what you want to get rid off LUL
[1:26:13] <vonmaultke> that sounds bullshit to me Jebaited
[1:26:13] <+Shaggnar> Dental issues, not just flossing
[1:26:15] <mortelkilll> like, we really shouldnt be upright but we are aniway and the body paying for it
[1:26:18] <Coystick> But not a causation
[1:26:23] <JoeNeutrino> That sounds like propaganda being spread by Big Floss.
[1:26:27] <FauxGateau> who wants to live forever?
[1:26:30] <BillieNoMates> Good excuse to drink wine
[1:26:37] <ECRead> is milk good or bad for you now? who the fuck knows
[1:26:37] <Coystick> DOWN WITH BIG FLOSS
[1:26:38] <+daveronald> coffee cures and causes cancer
[1:26:40] <DonatelloJose> there is so much misinformation these days, I just tune all that out.
[1:26:43] <+Punishedkaiger> Is this bloodborne chimes in the background?
[1:26:51] <+greenmistofhyrule> yes laser vision
[1:26:52] <FauxGateau> yeah that's mergos
[1:26:53] <Daxalog> STD super powers when?
[1:26:53] <AgentZombieMan> My beavers are uneven, my top molars are flaying outward, my bottom from teeth are mushed together, I've got 2 teeth that were just straight-up angled
[1:27:02] <+Punishedkaiger> The blud
[1:27:05] <BillieNoMates> Just melt their boyfriend
[1:27:06] <Coystick> K we can sleep head to toe and it won't be gay
[1:27:06] <Mr_Strut> Sounds more like raping someone at laserpoint
[1:27:12] <LordLicoriceDerp> laser-wink
[1:27:15] <Daxalog> at laserpoint
[1:27:19] <AgentZombieMan> @Mr_Strut Like Superman
[1:27:22] <JoeNeutrino> My teeth are very... British. The stereotype is true.
[1:27:26] <mortelkilll> are the lazers deadly lazers or like lazer pointers?
[1:27:26] <Coystick> call your dick the laserpointer
[1:27:27] <+wasson_g> you shoot a fly out of air
[1:27:37] <AgentZombieMan> DICK LAZERS
[1:27:42] <skelfae> there's like a thing in academia that eggs go from good to bad with a new study every month
[1:27:44] <person181> why would it come out of there
[1:27:44] <FauxGateau> my p mess
[1:27:45] <EmeraldSage> is no one going to mention the Blood Borne sound track?
[1:27:45] <Coystick> Just like Shin Godzilla
[1:27:45] <LordLicoriceDerp> ... dick light saber battles
[1:27:50] <LordLicoriceDerp> Beat Saber but with penises
[1:27:53] <$Captain_Krunk> This is true
[1:27:54] <+greenmistofhyrule> no anal lasers
[1:27:56] <+jorgamund> I mean, who can say what kind of death rays are available as options?
[1:27:57] <$Captain_Krunk> vineTommy
[1:28:00] <BillieNoMates> But can his laser penis make him fly like Cyclops
[1:28:21] <+0ni0n_L0rd> That's called fighting.
[1:28:30] <+jorgamund> we CAN settle things like rams. they're called street fights. People just frown on it now
[1:28:31] <Daxalog> Paige wants Medabots/pokemon/yu-gi-oh to be real.
[1:28:34] <Risingxiv> bash penises together to settle out differences?
[1:28:38] <TheAsylumCat> shin Chan literally had a star wars cock fight
[1:28:42] <mortelkilll> dont horns feel pain?
[1:28:46] <BillieNoMates> Nah
[1:28:46] <Mr_Strut> Sharp ones
[1:28:47] <AgentZombieMan> Okay wait shut the fuck up. @PlagueOfGripes I wanna hear that story
[1:28:49] <Piemono> Wouldn't the biggest and strongest always win then?
[1:28:57] <Mr_Strut> Spear horns
[1:28:58] <T_Sasquatch> i like horns
[1:29:03] <+greenmistofhyrule> i want big ram horns
[1:29:07] <mortelkilll> i guess it has to be a balance of otuhgness and ligntness
[1:29:09] <Daxalog> Would political leaders have the largest most dangerous or tricky to beat horns?
[1:29:12] <mortelkilll> toughness
[1:29:15] <TheAsylumCat> Yup, sums it up
[1:29:17] <DonatelloJose> young goats are like kittens with hoofs
[1:29:17] <Nineless> I already have enough headaches. I don't want to butt heads literally even with horns.
[1:29:18] <JoeNeutrino> I want the spiral horns of a markhour.
[1:29:19] <$Captain_Krunk> Just like foxes
[1:29:23] <+wasson_g> what about antlers?
[1:29:31] <DonatelloJose> they are sooo funny. they they grow up to be assholes
[1:29:31] <mortelkilll> antlers are horns i think
[1:29:36] <$Captain_Krunk> People think foxes are very cure when they're young. But when they get older, they're less fun to play with
[1:29:37] <BillieNoMates> Just have drill horns
[1:29:42] <$Captain_Krunk> Cute*
[1:29:43] <BillieNoMates> That constantly ossicilate
[1:29:44] <person181> can i retract them, this would change my awnser?
[1:29:46] <+jorgamund> @Daxalog yes. and eventually, the political system would evolve to where they don't need the horns, and the horns become ceremonial headgear. I.e. crowns Kappa
[1:29:52] <%FoxDemonXI> be careful with talking about kids with horns, it'll get a little to close to being homestuck
[1:29:52] <+Taglog7> I want my horns to stab my brain
[1:29:55] <Mr_Strut> Should draw Medli with horns
[1:29:56] <AgentZombieMan> Rhino Horn is the best, obviously
[1:30:01] <mortelkilll> blowhorns Kappa
[1:30:01] <%FoxDemonXI> zoneSweat
[1:30:02] <piggypig> waht if we had tusks coming out of our mouths?
[1:30:02] <T_Sasquatch> I'd want ram like horns
[1:30:04] <+Taglog7> Shedding antlers looks Brutal
[1:30:07] <Raconteur999> Ibex horns, like Loki's helmet
[1:30:08] <azure_end> My experiences with a pet goat was short term. It died in like 3 months of a snake bite.
[1:30:10] <+wasson_g> I think like texas long-horn horns would suck
[1:30:13] <TCMZiggy> Paige should cosplay as Maleficent
[1:30:16] <T_Sasquatch> Rhino horns are extreme
[1:30:16] <EmeraldSage> i'd want the sick horns ichigo gets from Bleach whern he gos full Hollow
[1:30:19] <Daxalog> Horns that grow back into your body
[1:30:26] <Kemmybelle> if Paige plays Dragon Age Inquisition, she can be a Qunari and be big & strong and have horns.
[1:30:28] <JoeNeutrino> I'd be afraid of having my horn broken. Would it feel like having your teeth broken or a broken bone?
[1:30:30] <editorsebas> Moose horns would be terrible
[1:30:41] <TheAsylumCat> I always thought tails would be cool, but Eli ruined that for me.
[1:30:44] <+wasson_g> what about a single unicorn horn?...huh?
[1:30:45] <+ElderDeku> Markhor is best.
[1:30:45] <Raconteur999> long horn bull
[1:30:49] <person181> @Daxalog those would be good for long hair
[1:30:52] <piggypig> a pig?
[1:30:54] <+ghostmutton> You could have a darth maul head
[1:30:55] <+MisterTylerrr> Mountain goats and Beavers
[1:30:56] <not_crabby> a boar
[1:30:58] <ScarletVenture> Did you know that a narwhal horn is a tooth?
[1:30:58] <BillieNoMates> rabbits do that
[1:30:59] <Risingxiv> boar
[1:31:02] <mortelkilll> so narwhals?
[1:31:05] <+Calliphor> look up cactus buck for weird horns
[1:31:08] <EmeraldSage> its tusk not horns, from a wild hof
[1:31:08] <carlosmanriquez> like hamsters
[1:31:09] <piggypig> paige what about tusks?
[1:31:09] <+Taglog7> orc tusks makes no sense
[1:31:12] <OrangeGameCinema> Some bird beaks do that, they curve into their neck
[1:31:16] <ECRead> it's a kind for feral boar
[1:31:16] <JoeNeutrino> So much for intelligent design.
[1:31:17] <+guesswhatadam> Hi plague!
[1:31:18] <T_Sasquatch> Now i think of it, I wonder how heavy horns must be
[1:31:19] <FauxGateau> reminds me of that angry beavers episode
[1:31:19] <+wasson_g> that'd be col to have a Narwhal horn on your wall
[1:31:30] <FauxGateau> where the teeth grow through your brain
[1:31:31] <AgentZombieMan> Babirusa, A.K.A. the Deer-Pig what you are thinking about Plage
[1:31:34] <AgentZombieMan> *Plague
[1:31:34] <+ElderDeku> Giraffes have ossicones. They're made of bone and aren't horns.
[1:31:37] <EmeraldSage> hog*
[1:31:41] <person181> why are we limiting ourselfs to living things, why not demon horns
[1:31:46] <carlosmanriquez> @PlagueOfGripes hamsters stab themselves on the neck with their teeth
[1:31:49] <AgentZombieMan> Apparently Rabbits have the same kind of issue with their teeth
[1:31:54] <BillieNoMates> With giant bone boners
[1:31:55] <Nineless> Doesn't the narwhal count as a tusk?
[1:31:57] <mortelkilll> the nrwhal horn actually a giant tooth thats piercing their face
[1:32:00] <JoeNeutrino> LUL
[1:32:02] <+Shaggnar> That's not a horn, that's a tooth that grows out of your face
[1:32:02] <KayThree> we're basically already there plague
[1:32:04] <BillieNoMates> Since elephant seals have a bone in their junk
[1:32:06] <Nineless> Horns on head, tusks from jaws.
[1:32:08] <ScarletVenture> Having a narwhal horn would imply you'd have a single extremely long tooth sticking up through your lip.
[1:32:09] <mortelkilll> also narwhals cant fight with it, its super sensible
[1:32:24] <JoeNeutrino> Like two obese men in a mosh pit.
[1:32:31] <skelfae> because giraffes whip their heads around to try break ech othrs necks. giraffe fights are fucked up
[1:32:46] <AgentZombieMan> Blood Fucking is the Best Fucking
[1:32:46] <Raconteur999> they're biting, though, aren't they?
[1:32:50] <Parapattern> She got a pizza box in that boat
[1:32:52] <Mr_Strut> Why do they have giant testicles on their face
[1:32:53] <Theforgottenregiment> Dick noses, heh.
[1:32:55] <+wasson_g> I wonder if a paleolithic explorer found a narwhal tusk and used it as a spear
[1:33:00] <Hydrapissed> !uptime
[1:33:00] <@Nightbot> 1 hour 33 minutes 10 seconds
[1:33:08] <ehStuGatz> otters have the kinkiest and worst sex
[1:33:12] <mortelkilll> some species get screwed sexually
[1:33:20] <ScarletVenture> Elephant seal bulls are cunts
[1:33:23] <JoeNeutrino> Like ducks
[1:33:33] <Hydrapissed> is plague okay?
[1:33:34] <+Probliterator> What is this about Zebra?
[1:33:35] <Mr_Strut> Why not duck penises
[1:33:46] <Daxalog> Why do Zebras have so much seminal fluid? God
[1:33:47] <mortelkilll> duck penises can only exist for duck vaginas
[1:33:49] <ehStuGatz> otters will regularly drown their mates by holding their heads underwater during sex
[1:33:50] <skelfae> giraffe fights!
[1:33:51] <DonatelloJose> Oh

[1:38:06] <hulkster95> They sleep more then sloths for fucks sake
[1:38:11] <+Shaggnar> Koala's are just Panda's that live in trees
[1:38:14] <Theforgottenregiment> Koalas are dumb as well.

[1:40:15] <heytakeiteasyterry> hi
[1:40:15] <AgentZombieMan> @person181 Other koalas probably
[1:40:17] <Raconteur999> The Trumps probably do

[1:40:33] <carlosmanriquez> https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FZBo2wBH0zE&t=0s&list=LLAMkJx2Fj1xT0g9J5CLH_wA&index=23
[1:40:33] <person181> @AgentZombieMan it's a mad mad world out there
[1:40:36] <+Bacon_Rage> D:
[1:40:36] <jiin6> Shit paige
[1:40:37] <ScarletVenture> Pap, not palp
[1:40:41] <$Captain_Krunk> vineJape
[1:40:51] <Futurecity10> Pap
[1:40:51] <LordLicoriceDerp> So you're saying koalas are the king of eating ass
[1:40:52] <ehStuGatz> eat that ass like it's groceries
[1:40:53] <skelfae> aussie here they have survived solely by being nutritionally worthless to predators
[1:40:54] <jiin6> i learned that from manga
[1:40:54] <BillieNoMates> just milk the anus, baby koala
[1:40:55] <$Captain_Krunk> Talk about being up your ma's ass
[1:40:56] <+lols_royce> so it can aquire the right gut flora
[1:40:56] <harraceharrison> Eat da poopoo
[1:40:58] <Mr_Strut> Yes Paige. Butt.
[1:40:58] <Bambelkun> amazing koala
[1:40:58] <+Ell1ot> the leaves are too poisonous for the babies
[1:41:00] <FunkyRot> this is fucking horrible
[1:41:00] <carlosmanriquez> https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sjt8ufc6GtY&t=0s&list=LLAMkJx2Fj1xT0g9J5CLH_wA&index=20
[1:41:01] <+Taglog7> eat shit kid ..... okay
[1:41:03] <RememberNotorious> they aren't worth saving
[1:41:03] <Raconteur999> you gotta introduce the gut bacteria somehow
[1:41:04] <$Captain_Krunk> YES
[1:41:05] <RememberNotorious> let them die
[1:41:07] <AgentZombieMan> Can we just firebomb Australia? Be doing everyone a favor, including the Australian Residents
[1:41:08] <Coystick> It's depicted in the aussie 5$ bill
[1:41:08] <ChortlesJ1> This is the greatest stream
[1:41:10] <vonmaultke> actual shit eating retard bears LUL
[1:41:11] <BillieNoMates> the babies don't have the right bacteria
[1:41:15] <+ElderDeku> Gut flora.
[1:41:15] <Dragonfighter46> koala facts are the best
[1:41:15] <jiin6> immunity from Ecalyptus oil
[1:41:17] <ScarletVenture> I think the technical reason is that the mother has microbes in her belly that help digest the eucalyptus, but the babies don't have it.
[1:41:20] <bunnog> gasp i found you!
[1:41:22] <bunnog> OhMyDog
[1:41:25] <+jorgamund> I want webcam footage of someone who doesn't know who Plauge is, coming into this chat for the first time because he wanted to see Zelda drawings
[1:41:26] <FauxGateau> watching plague torture paige with animal facts while i stare on in abject terror is my new aesthetic
[1:41:30] <piggypig> evolution is funny like that
[1:41:33] <+lols_royce> they need the bacteria that can handle eucalyptis
[1:41:36] <BillieNoMates> Just nuke Australia
[1:41:39] <BillieNoMates> It's safer
[1:41:39] <+Sapphire2300> okay no
[1:41:43] <TheAsylumCat> fucking spiders in Australia
[1:41:43] <Hydrapissed> nuke it all
[1:41:46] <%Freonade> "Irrespective of how we act on this planet, 25% of species that were here today will be gone tomorrow. Let them go gracefully!" - George Carlin
[1:41:46] <+Sapphire2300> the worst creature is the sunfish
[1:41:46] <+wasson_g> humans are like that with Wolf Brand Chili.
[1:41:48] <AgentZombieMan> Vagina?
[1:41:48] <+Ell1ot> i looked up the zebra thing you were talking about
[1:41:49] <DonatelloJose> eating during this stream was a mistake....
[1:41:56] <jiin6> Paige got hugged by koala
[1:42:01] <skelfae> it's claws are horrific
[1:42:03] <jiin6> every day
[1:42:08] <$Captain_Krunk> Why...
[1:42:18] <Breezeknight> the great emu war anyone?
[1:42:20] <+greenmistofhyrule> dont nuke australia you'll just buff it
[1:42:24] <jiin6> by the neck and throw them into the forest
[1:42:27] <jggoryl> koalas were only recently observed drinking water in the wild
[1:42:28] <+wasson_g> because dogs rule.
[1:42:28] <Hydrapissed> lol
[1:42:29] <AgentZombieMan> Dogs will eat the Koala then get chlamydia
[1:42:32] <jggoryl> like last year
[1:42:37] <ScarletVenture> "Mmm boy, I can't get enough of this koala-killin'! Woof."
[1:42:38] <TheAsylumCat> @breezeknight oh christ
[1:42:39] <Futurecity10> I would kill all koalas to get back dodos
[1:42:42] <jiin6> you don't want mutant koala's
[1:42:43] <+wasson_g> my precious pooch would kill the shit out of a koala.
[1:42:44] <Nineless> Dog will fix human problem.
[1:42:45] <harraceharrison> They need to get the Koalas to fight the cane toads
[1:42:46] <+lols_royce> kinda? in certain areas they are
[1:42:53] <Theforgottenregiment> The Great Emu War was amazing.
[1:42:54] <DoubleDurian> Koalas are def of the spectrum
[1:42:54] <+Shaggnar> They're close, they're vulnerable
[1:42:55] <Laecerelius> Dog rule, just like O’Brien!
[1:43:00] <+lols_royce> regional varients
[1:43:00] <AgentZombieMan> There should be Koala Golfing day. Just take out clubs once a month and thwap those fuckers
[1:43:01] <jiin6> Tasmanian Devil's are riddled with cancer
[1:43:09] <$Captain_Krunk> But people wuv them BabyRage
[1:43:11] <DoubleDurian> Plague, are koalas on the spectrum
[1:43:15] <skelfae> kangaroos next! they're six foot tall beef slabs who can kick holes in your stomach
[1:43:21] <rakshum> koalas are on "too stupid to live" list
[1:43:21] <Artista_AF> yeah but at least Pandas can learn Kung Fu
[1:43:24] <mortelkilll> ive heard panda actually shouldnt eat bamboo, they are supposed to have another diet but bamboo all they can find
[1:43:24] <+jorgamund> Pandas are God's way of refuting the idea of natural selection
[1:43:29] <jiin6> Kangaroos are just jumping rats
[1:43:31] <$Captain_Krunk> We let them exist, keeping natural selection from wiping them out
[1:43:33] <Mr_Strut> They developed the most useful evolutionary trait. Ingratiating themselves to humans.
[1:43:35] <AgentZombieMan> Pandas are at least cool. Koalas are evil.
[1:43:37] <+Shaggnar> They also shoot the babies out like a god damn cannon
[1:43:45] <ScarletVenture> Tactical baby theft
[1:43:46] <Huntercd> Pandas deserve death
[1:43:48] <Nineless> 😂 Replace babby.
[1:43:52] <+Ell1ot> well, it is easier to take care of one baby than two
[1:43:56] <Risingxiv> females only want to mate at one time of the year and if the female isnt in the mood then they wont mate at all that year
[1:44:03] <+wasson_g> only after like billions of dollars
[1:44:03] <BillieNoMates> Pandas are forcibly inseminated
[1:44:04] <Raconteur999> Oh, not even one plant, They need one TYPE of one plant, gotta be the one they're familiar with
[1:44:06] <Coystick> Why bother, let nature do what nature wants to do
[1:44:11] <BillieNoMates> Then the babies are taken FROM the mother to raise them
[1:44:13] <Bambelkun> need a tier list of horrible animal
[1:44:14] <jiin6> Panda's are prudes
[1:44:22] <+wasson_g> literally the hugest waste of money
[1:44:27] <piggypig> one panda got super horny
[1:44:36] <Hydrapissed> its what I need
[1:44:37] <+Ell1ot> they need the stank to get in the mood
[1:44:41] <ScarletVenture> Pandas are nature's R. Kelly
[1:44:42] <Mr_Strut> They LOVE the smell of stale piss
[1:44:42] <Raconteur999> Like Pat
[1:44:43] <DonatelloJose> science.
[1:44:57] <LordLicoriceDerp> Pandas are the goddamn worst
[1:44:57] <jiin6> they love panda porn
[1:44:57] <+Ell1ot> Pandas like Panda porn?
[1:44:59] <TheAsylumCat> panda porn
[1:45:03] <editorsebas> it's like watching tier zoo
[1:45:05] <%Freonade> Educational
[1:45:09] <+Ell1ot> well, makes sense
[1:45:11] <heytakeiteasyterry> they love the smell of piss
[1:45:16] <SwagetronPrime> Urin. Nature's aphrodisiac
[1:45:23] <cherubsanonymous> Plague getting red-pilled tonight
[1:45:24] <BillieNoMates> Just the ones that were delicious
[1:45:26] <$Captain_Krunk> We as the supreme power of the animal kingdom ALLOW you pandas to live! JUST. LIVE!
[1:45:28] <+wasson_g> lol. it's all true.
[1:45:29] <+MechaBaphomet> Like people?
[1:45:30] <jiin6> Nature just wants things dead, Let Nature Take the Shot
[1:45:31] <Laecerelius> Plague X TierZoo when?!?!
[1:45:31] <DonatelloJose> evolution is cruel, but fair.
[1:45:37] <TheAsylumCat> @swagetronprime more so than we'd like
[1:45:52] <+lols_royce> its cause we invented passenger airplanes instead
[1:45:56] <person181> pigen go BIG DOWN
[1:45:58] <+lols_royce> drove them to extinction
[1:46:09] <heytakeiteasyterry> someone make this an audio clip for sound cloud
[1:46:11] <Bambelkun> i cant wait for next patch
[1:46:11] <cherubsanonymous> WORLD IS A FUCK
[1:46:15] <TheAsylumCat> dodos
[1:46:15] <themagic_conch> born to die world is a fuck
[1:46:19] <+Ell1ot> they wanted more options or only the ugly ones were left
[1:46:19] <hectoriglesiasbenavides> like dodos?
[1:46:23] <ScarletVenture> I mean, our species IS why there's like a billion times more jellyfish in the ocean now.
[1:46:27] <Raconteur999> aardwolf
[1:46:28] <hectoriglesiasbenavides> tortoises
[1:46:29] <$Captain_Krunk> Don't worry, a new organism will come along and replace them :P
[1:46:32] <Futurecity10> Give me dodo's back
[1:46:39] <DoubleDurian> What if you could engineer a panda to be lean, agile, dynamic, and powferully horny
[1:46:41] <mortelkilll> gotta admire the species that thrive in human presence liek rats and jellyfishes
[1:46:42] <+wasson_g> Merrichippis. best name ever.
[1:46:46] <ScarletVenture> The dickdick
[1:46:48] <Theforgottenregiment> Thylacines rule.
[1:46:49] <skelfae> Tasmania tiger
[1:46:51] <Nineless> Woolly mammoth!
[1:46:52] <+wasson_g> dik-dik.
[1:46:52] <+greenmistofhyrule> dikdik
[1:46:53] <Coystick> Terror Bird
[1:46:56] <Blaze33405> Megalodon is my favorite
[1:47:03] <rakshum> recently extinct animals fascinate me
[1:47:09] <+Taglog7> Release the Giant Sloth!
[1:47:14] <carlosmanriquez> @PlagueOfGripes walking with dinasours is a fucking good show that has an episode about the ice age
[1:47:18] <LordLicoriceDerp> Carcals are murder kittens
[1:47:18] <+greenmistofhyrule> yessss leaf sized
[1:47:20] <LordLicoriceDerp> Carcacals?
[1:47:23] <+wasson_g> yeah the Pleistocene era ended a mere 11k ago.
[1:47:28] <DonatelloJose> is it a desert cat or jungle cat?
[1:47:35] <+wasson_g> geographically speaking...is it actually over?
[1:47:36] <Raconteur999> ah, that's what I mean, Tasmanian Tiger
[1:47:36] <LordLicoriceDerp> Caracals, that's the one
[1:47:36] <piggypig> @carlosmanriquez youre thinking of the sequel, walking with beasts
[1:47:37] <TheAsylumCat> @nineless I'm imagining a elephant with dreads
[1:47:41] <+wasson_g> geologically i mean..
[1:47:44] <bursky00> We have leopard cats where we live and they're really cute and small, haven't seen one in the wild for a while though.
[1:47:50] <Coystick> EElmo is the deadliest cat alive
[1:47:53] <%Freonade> THE BABY
[1:47:56] <ScarletVenture> Caracals scream and it sounds like a laser. They're cool.
[1:48:02] <mortelkilll> big cats are just big cats
[1:48:10] <AgentZombieMan> Anyone else getting a Dwight Schrute vibe from Plague this episode?
[1:48:13] <%EpicBigchill> its soothing
[1:48:14] <Andele1503> Best animals are Crocodiles, they have been around since almost forever and barely changed
[1:48:27] <+jorgamund> wasn't winamp discontinued?
[1:48:28] <Hydrapissed> wheres my fortnite songs
[1:48:30] <Bambelkun> it nice plague
[1:48:33] <+wasson_g> You could argue that elephants and Rhinos are leftovers from the ice age, as the last reminants of the megafauna
[1:48:34] <mortelkilll> there qutie a few animal that managed to survive a long time on very primitive bodies
[1:48:35] <Raconteur999> Elmo is the biggest hunter of Loops
[1:48:36] <mortelkilll> like sharks
[1:48:37] <skelfae> speaking of things that need to be allowed to die
[1:48:38] <TheAsylumCat> @andele1503 is argue octopus
[1:48:40] <DonatelloJose> Classical symphonies are my jam.
[1:48:44] <DoubleDurian> Speculate on alien biology plague
[1:48:59] <+Ell1ot> every time Plague says an animal fact, i have to look it up to see if he's wrong
[1:48:59] <Theforgottenregiment> Pandas are technically carnivores. Those lazy fucks need to start eating meat again.
[1:49:00] <Andele1503> @TheAsylumCat Yup, tentacles too are great
[1:49:02] <piggypig> @Andele1503 crocodillians used to be super varied in size and shape, there use to be one that archeologists call armadillo croc
[1:49:04] <Bambelkun> i learn alot of animal horrible fact
[1:49:07] <Coystick> And I thought I was going overboard with 12k songs
[1:49:10] <Hydrapissed> Luv that mumble rap
[1:49:12] <+modmanawesome69> Play some Bluegrass covers of Rock Songs! Plague got me hooked on that shit
[1:49:15] <mortelkilll> the alien biology thing is a myth based on a scientist hyperboling
[1:49:17] <ehStuGatz> wasn't there a croc that could run
[1:49:22] <suikudo> First live stream i came to plague was jamming to like snoop or something
[1:49:24] <Huntercd> Plague has good taste
[1:49:29] <mortelkilll> octopus are 100% related to other cephalopods, they arent aliens
[1:49:31] <jiin6> its good to be selective with music
[1:49:37] <+ElderDeku> I bet Plague listens to Week
[1:49:40] <+ElderDeku> Ween*
[1:49:45] <FunkyRot> as long as the song is good then its good
[1:49:46] <VasWookiee> @PlagueOfGripes Plague I really licke your streams and I appreciate and thank the world everyday that you exist. So basically thank you for existing.
[1:49:54] <Andele1503> @piggypig size, yes, shape, barely (skull shape is the most varied thing across their fossil record, bone location and count mostly stuck to scale based on size
[1:50:02] <DonatelloJose> <3 Glen Miller is Bae

[1:51:41] <ScarletVenture> Like 1920s to 1980s.
[1:51:42] <+wasson_g> really good covers of vidya music.
[1:51:51] <AgentZombieMan> Parov Stelar does Electro-Swing music and it's great
[1:51:59] <BillieNoMates> its why you don't listen to people and ignore everyone
[1:52:00] <Raconteur999> "Thanks, I hate it"
[1:52:03] <Coystick> I got into Barbara Acklin thanks to Plague
[1:52:06] <BillieNoMates> Its the only way to success
[1:52:12] <VasWookiee> Plague u maek me happey

[1:53:10] <VasWookiee> What's your opinion on Gachi music? I personally cant get it out of my head @PlagueOfGripes
[1:53:24] <Coystick> Powerglove did Blood Dragon's OST from mem
[1:53:33] <DonatelloJose> @Mrbaconator Thier spark amndrill cover is AMAZING
[1:53:35] <BillieNoMates> Murder cockerel

[1:53:59] <person181> i've never known how old any of the cats i've had were
[1:54:03] <ScarletVenture> "Hah, sentimentality."
[1:54:14] <VasWookiee> @PlagueOfGripes You look exactly how I expected
[1:54:21] <Bambelkun> LUL
[1:54:24] <Hydrapissed> a lil upset
[1:54:25] <Laecerelius> His lifestyle determined his death style
[1:54:26] <+NirvashTypeMQ> what did the cat do to you :(
[1:54:28] <cherubsanonymous> He always sounds upset, Paige
[1:54:32] <@Nightbot> Plague is a youtube animator and also streams at https://picarto.tv/Plague . Also: t-shirts! http://goo.gl/lze8QO
[1:54:39] <@Nightbot> @dzmi13 -> Who the heck are you? My evil twin? [stop spamming emotes] [warning]
[1:54:42] <+Cook_4_Souls> Hey plague
[1:54:47] <Hydrapissed> OH MY goodd hes hurting
[1:54:49] <Strayed1> LUL
[1:54:51] <Coystick> Podcast title
[1:54:51] <DonatelloJose> darkness imprisoning me
[1:54:51] <+dzmi13> bitterTears
[1:54:51] <suikudo> Plague please be my big brother!
[1:54:52] <Theforgottenregiment> Plague demands the most from his animal companions.
[1:54:56] <+SWindleFeD> @PlagueOfGripes go darker please
[1:55:04] <FauxGateau> this is what i come here for
[1:55:09] <Raconteur999> elephants bury the dead
[1:55:10] <+Taglog7> Keepo
[1:55:11] <jiin6> Cats eat owners corpses
[1:55:18] <Laecerelius> Trash her dead baby’s grave
[1:55:29] <Futurecity10> Cats will eat your corpse second one
[1:55:31] <FauxGateau> "if you didn't wanna be eaten you shouldn't have died, idiot."
[1:55:35] <Theforgottenregiment> Cats kinda care, at times.
[1:55:39] <FauxGateau> do they?
[1:55:42] <Raconteur999> someone said they were taking a nap and woke up covered in leaves and branches
[1:55:48] <Raconteur999> it freaked out the elephants
[1:55:54] <ScarletVenture> Cats are smart enough to realize that you aren't your dead corpse.
[1:56:00] <DonatelloJose> My cats did that a couple years ago. When one passed, the other gave up.
[1:56:01] <jiin6> Cats are jerks, they only care if your not suffering enough
[1:56:04] <DoubleDurian> Elephants detected and some say even caused the Hatian earthquake
[1:56:08] <ScarletVenture> Dogs only care about your BODY, ugh
[1:56:36] <korg1b> @PlagueOfGripes u like Elliott Smith?
[1:56:58] <Coystick> I'm upset now
[1:57:01] <ScarletVenture> what
[1:57:10] <$Captain_Krunk> This is Oblivion logic. (Shot by arrow) "Hmmph, must have been the wind" LUL
[1:57:13] <+NirvashTypeMQ> how does he know all this?
[1:57:15] <ScarletVenture> No wonder I like giraffes.
[1:57:16] <piggypig> elephant doctors will sometimes go waist deep in their anuses to check on their health
[1:57:18] <Raconteur999> elephant butts have to be big because of big trunks reaching in
[1:57:19] <+lols_royce> its tough to see whats going on from all the way up there
[1:57:19] <Theforgottenregiment> A for effort, my dear pachyderm.
[1:57:21] <MrHappyFunshine> yer killing me bro
[1:57:28] <Hydrapissed> Great plowing
[1:57:30] <+wasson_g> well...look at them.
[1:57:36] <+PenmanLupine> Medli looks like she's going to tell me how I got caught by that imperial ambush.
[1:57:37] <FunkyRot> how does plauge know so much about animal facts?
[1:57:37] <Hydrapissed> Its true
[1:57:37] <Theforgottenregiment> Mondo gay.
[1:57:38] <jiin6> Giraffes are the big gays
[1:57:40] <+wasson_g> they're pretty queer.
[1:57:45] <Hydrapissed> Ultra GAY
[1:57:47] <FunkyRot> theyre turbo gay
[1:57:51] <OrangeGameCinema> time to clear my history
[1:57:59] <ScarletVenture> I like giraffes like at least 15% more now.
[1:58:17] <+wasson_g> all tall and neat looking, prancing around the Serengeti. total divas.
[1:58:19] <ehStuGatz> giraffes are literally the big gay
[1:58:20] <LordLicoriceDerp> not a lot to do out there in the savannah
[1:58:24] <not_crabby> how do you feel that your discord is as gay as giraffes @PlagueOfGripes
[1:58:27] <Mr_Strut> I love learning about nature because it makes me feel better about destroying it.
[1:58:31] <ScarletVenture> A giraffe could climb a tree once, then it would die.

[2:10:59] <Coystick> R I P big puss
[2:11:03] <AgentZombieMan> From what I know about Plague, he probably wasn't so much of a Bully as he was just a Dick. Like he wouldn't steal lunch money or pick on little kids, but would also do things like Hadukening basketballs into people's faces.
[2:11:04] <hntronium> Best among us
[2:11:18] <%c_tighearnach> i was a standoffish lonely loser type, and now there's nobody for me to be standoffish towards

[2:13:05] <laserbeaming> You can make it go slower
[2:13:10] <sosuke5> But that's the game though
[2:13:10] <+ChimeraGryph> the other way is to play the song of time backwards to slow it down
[2:13:10] <+Draylle> isnt that the central mechanic though?
[2:13:11] <hntronium> Paige, no, bad
[2:13:18] <hntronium> I know you hate timers but no

[2:24:54] <finaltrinity5> they fall and ruin a great picture spot at Yosemite national park
[2:24:56] <RememberNotorious> they do
[2:24:59] <BillieNoMates> They'd just die vertically like large oaks tend to
[2:25:02] <+daveronald> they rot and crumble slowly
[2:25:03] <+Jigokuro> so much arguing
[2:25:03] <+MechaBaphomet> LUL
[2:25:05] <+Draylle> climbing means "ascension" right? you would climb a log for the 1 foot that is its width
[2:25:05] <Artista_AF> they start falling appart
[2:25:13] <+modmanawesome69> usually wind and mud weakening the roots
[2:25:23] <ECRead> they just rot
[2:25:26] <finaltrinity5> WORMS
[2:25:26] <+wasson_g> they die on their feet, like men.
[2:25:41] <+modmanawesome69> and fun fact. the big ones cause earthquake feeling shakes

[2:26:04] <+daveronald> you could just dig a hole
[2:26:05] <medjoe> would make for a sick tree house
[2:26:06] <+tussletoes> Being buried in a tree sounds like something I can get behind
[2:26:06] <finaltrinity5> imagine hollowing out a tree to hide bodies
[2:26:15] <finaltrinity5> DRRR DRR DRRR

[2:40:36] <+Shaggnar> Petsmart will cover up the Pat smell
[2:40:41] <BillieNoMates> Play with the animals and throw the dead in the woods like tradition states
[2:41:00] <+dickbuttwoman> Those smells synergize

[2:50:02] <person181> @DraxTD of course
[2:50:07] <%Cogito1001> You think Zuccerberg sits up all night processing all the data on facebook to send back to his home planet?
[2:50:09] <mortelkilll> facebook to me is 90% moms and grandma so not the best place to date
[2:50:09] <+wasson_g> the guy looks like a fuckin loser.
[2:50:11] <finaltrinity5> hey man she said it, not me @carlosmanriquez

[2:52:35] <%Cogito1001> Real men use either garlic or basil
[2:52:37] <vonmaultke> That sounds like an arbitrary thing to pick at someone over
[2:52:42] <+dickbuttwoman> He thought croutons should be cinammon flavored
[2:52:49] <BillieNoMates> Sounds like she is high maintenance
[2:52:49] <Coystick> What a monster
[2:52:50] <+dickbuttwoman> Like a cinnamon toast crunch of some sort
[2:52:55] <T_Sasquatch> eating rabbit food LUL

[2:53:04] <Huntercd> Kale is seaweed?
[2:53:06] <finaltrinity5> oh man she didnt rinse the kale
[2:53:06] <vonmaultke> Sounds absurdly high maintenance
[2:53:15] <BillieNoMates> Plagues face then was exactly what I did
[2:53:16] <+wasson_g> the real answer of the test was to slap her and have HER make a sandwich for him.
[2:53:16] <carlosmanriquez> @finaltrinity5 my internet will kill itself, it doesn't like me stopping the show
[2:53:16] <LordLicoriceDerp> "You didn't rinse my kale right"

[2:53:54] <BillieNoMates> Plague of Nihilism

[2:54:07] <vonmaultke> Plague isn't wrong
[2:54:09] <%Cogito1001> Nito

[2:59:53] <Huntercd> Al Bundy was a great dad
[2:59:54] <+Nefarious_Bear> Al Bundy is timeless
[2:59:56] <finaltrinity5> oh jesus lol
[2:59:56] <%Cogito1001> Al Bundy was the GOAT
[2:59:58] <+modmanawesome69> al bundy is the best
[2:59:59] <cherubsanonymous> That's clever af how dare
[3:00:02] <T_Sasquatch> I just realised how weird married with children sounds LUL

[3:00:12] <finaltrinity5> yooo till I collapse
[3:00:14] <person181> that show is so dated
[3:00:16] <+Nefarious_Bear> The wife was also the voice of Leela

[3:00:29] <mayorrev> oh shit eminem
[3:00:30] <+dickbuttwoman> 4 TOUCHDOWNS
[3:00:32] <mayorrev> my jam
[3:00:36] <OrangeGameCinema> It was clever. Because she's so fat that even less fat women orbit her
[3:00:38] <+Nefarious_Bear> yeah his wife always wanted to fuck and Al was like NAH
[3:00:44] <Huntercd> Peggy was hot
[3:00:44] <OrangeGameCinema> not just skinny ones
[3:00:47] <IntrepidEye> Al Bundy. Supposedly dirt poor but still has a nice house
[3:00:55] <%Cogito1001> I had so much trouble connecting Peggy Bundy's voice to Taraunga Leela
[3:00:59] <%Cogito1001> its still weird to me
[3:01:00] <Huntercd> Marcy was cute too
[3:01:05] <piggypig> we talking about king of the hill?
[3:01:11] <+Nefarious_Bear> I remember the episode where Peggy was berating Al for making so little money, and it turns out the only person that made less money than Al was Peggy LUL

[3:01:51] <cowunstoppable> what video games are people playing these days?
[3:01:54] <%Cogito1001> In a later episode of Futurama the even refrenced Married with Children and it was still weird
[3:01:56] <Huntercd> Al's wife and daughter were so hot
[3:02:01] <IntrepidEye> I'm still in love with Death Peg. She looked amazing with her natural hair.
[3:02:06] <mortelkilll> @cowunstoppable lots of smash bros
[3:02:08] <+Nefarious_Bear> My parents didnt want me watching Family Guy, which is understandable

[3:06:52] <Hydrapissed> Dead by daylight drawings
[3:06:54] <SlayrideTwinsinner> The stoner was voiced by Pauly Shore
[3:06:58] <Huntercd> Roxanne was hot
[3:07:05] <mortelkilll> meh, people sometime just forget girls they were into
[3:07:11] <+dickbuttwoman> Pistol pete is a thing
[3:07:13] <mortelkilll> especially if it doesnt work out
[3:07:15] <onesleepymonkey> They dated once, realized they didn't like each other and parted ways. my guess anyway

[3:08:23] <carlosmanriquez> to the extreme
[3:08:31] <cherubsanonymous> Extremely Goofy Movie has some of the most hilarious character animation I've ever seen
[3:08:34] <SlayrideTwinsinner> PJ got that poetry chick
[3:08:37] <Firemane1279> Roxanna makes an apperance in the Disney Channel show from 2000 before hanging with the Heroes started
[3:08:39] <JoeNeutrino> Put on some Powerline and crank that shit up.
[3:08:43] <Shadow_Jager> No Roxane or even a mention in the second movie.
[3:08:50] <FunkyRot> will Plague ever grow long hair?

[3:10:01] <SlayrideTwinsinner> But PJ got with that hot poetry girl which actually oddly enough was an inspiration to me.
[3:10:11] <SlayrideTwinsinner> That even big guys can get decent girls.
[3:10:12] <finaltrinity5> plague of gripes the twitch thot
[3:10:18] <SlayrideTwinsinner> And I've found that to actually be true.
[3:10:19] <+Bacon_Rage> thot that doesn't pay his taxes

[3:10:23] <+dickbuttwoman> If she breathe she a thot
[3:10:26] <+Shaggnar> Yes
[3:10:27] <+blazymaniac> just draw a character on it, and then write it off as a business expense
[3:10:27] <Explodincatz> i still have no idea what a thot is
[3:10:33] <+Nefarious_Bear> EYEBROWS ON FLEEK

[3:10:50] <mayorrev> all women are queens, anakin!
[3:10:51] <jeecay> @SlayrideTwinsinner biggie smalls imparted that to me at a young age. still haven't figured out how to do it though
[3:10:51] <FunkyRot> i remember
[3:10:51] <Huntercd> What the fuck is fleck?
[3:10:54] <carlosmanriquez> bieng fleek is radical
[3:10:56] <%Cogito1001> It was Wack

[3:11:23] <Firemane1279> House of Mouse! That's the show Roxanne makes an appearance in after the movies.
[3:11:25] <person181> this is why i use old slang like tubular and gnarlly
[3:11:27] <Artista_AF> oh man, the poetry girl doesn't get enough porn, which is weird because Pete & Pete Jr are basically what every hentai artist thinks "a hot guy, every reader can self-insert as"
[3:11:28] <%Cogito1001> Bird up
[3:11:29] <+Bro_Dzee> @finaltrinity5 agree
[3:11:32] <+dickbuttwoman> Hello fellow kids
[3:11:39] <SlayrideTwinsinner> @jeecay Confidence. Actually there's a quote from Shisho Makoto from Rurouni Kenshin that applies here.
[3:11:52] <SlayrideTwinsinner> "Women are attracted to a real man, no matter what he looks like."
[3:11:58] <Huntercd> Is this when she hit the pregnant chick
[3:12:17] <SlayrideTwinsinner> Shisho is fucking fantastic.
[3:12:19] <mayorrev> PJSalt

[3:12:27] <finaltrinity5> first of all no its not
[3:12:34] <jeecay> @SlayrideTwinsinner Shishio Makoto is great
[3:12:34] <arkv01> paige is letting her thothood show again
[3:12:35] <+dickbuttwoman> "We taught her wrong, as a joke"
[3:12:37] <SlayrideTwinsinner> Sucks that the creator of Rurouni Kenshin is a pedo :(
[3:12:38] <%Cogito1001> Saudi
[3:12:38] <carlosmanriquez> how do you not know this highly specific thing?
[3:12:39] <FauxGateau> you're out of touch
[3:12:41] <%Freonade> She was just Out of Touch
[3:12:46] <carlosmanriquez> it's in the news
[3:12:55] <finaltrinity5> she sounds salty
[3:12:55] <Piemono> She was obviously talking about the Saudis and their effects on world politics
[3:12:58] <+Nefarious_Bear> "being salty" comes from a mad person looking like they just ate a bowl of salt iirc
[3:13:00] <cherubsanonymous> Sexksis
[3:13:01] <suikudo> shawdy?
[3:13:01] <SlayrideTwinsinner> Like his personal shit aside what he makes is great.
[3:13:01] <Coystick> Ditto

[3:13:07] <carlosmanriquez> sauty?
[3:13:10] <ECRead> they were what we like to call "wrong"
[3:13:10] <@dcn2049> So are we, plague.
[3:13:11] <+dickbuttwoman> Plague, you're the most feminine of the extended best friends family
[3:13:13] <FauxGateau> im surprised woman havent gone crazy yet

[3:13:18] <finaltrinity5> freshman year college we just replaced everytime we would say "salty" with "sally"
[3:13:23] <+dickbuttwoman> The most sensitive
[3:13:31] <mayorrev> @PeachSaliva how do you come across the nastiest people, mostly girls?
[3:13:37] <%Cogito1001> LIBERAL!?
[3:13:47] <person181> most don't like other men right from the start
[3:13:48] <+Nefarious_Bear> I dont wanna super generalize but guys dont really cheme against other guys behind their back
[3:13:53] <+Nefarious_Bear> *scheme
[3:13:58] <finaltrinity5> @mayorrev for real, remember the story of that drunk girl that attacked paige?
[3:13:59] <jeecay> Plague is an alien confirmed
[3:14:10] <+wasson_g> lol you think her circumstances are unique?
[3:14:17] <+Nefarious_Bear> Guys can fight each other in one second and then be buying each other drinks in the other second
[3:14:19] <+dickbuttwoman> Does my shitty sonic facts spam make you angry plague?
[3:14:20] <FauxGateau> women are horrifying is the short answer
[3:14:24] <Coystick> Vvymyn
[3:14:33] <T_Sasquatch> i mean, if i don't like a dude its probably going to end in a fight which is extremely rare for me
[3:14:36] <+Taglog7> mean girl pwa
[3:14:41] <carlosmanriquez> you are a magnet of trouble paige, without even trying
[3:14:43] <%Cogito1001> This song is strangly fitting
[3:14:44] <Futurecity10> Woman are horrible people in general Kappa
[3:14:46] <finaltrinity5> is that the girl who sent you taylor swift lyrics?
[3:14:53] <+Nefarious_Bear> women, amirite? Kappa
[3:14:56] <T_Sasquatch> The dislike has to be from a real situation where a fight will happen
[3:15:04] <+dickbuttwoman> Woolie rn: "JUST TALK"
[3:15:10] <+Nefarious_Bear> LUL
[3:15:11] <Coystick> Women are the ducks of the animal kingdom.
[3:15:11] <FauxGateau> huh there's no way that worked.
[3:15:24] <piggypig> i once knew a girl who paid a guy to stab my friend'd boyfriend
[3:15:28] <Laecerelius> Paige with the Talk no Jutsu!
[3:15:31] <OrangeGameCinema> Stalked for 2 years over a misunderstanding. mercy
[3:15:31] <mayorrev> mistaken identity?
[3:15:36] <JoeNeutrino> That is some scary crazy.
[3:15:41] <T_Sasquatch> "Just talk" sounds like a dumb plot point but people in real life literally wont talk
[3:15:49] <+WhyIDie> "Oh god, I'm insecure, time to lash out"
[3:15:53] <PsychedelicRev> People are too difficult
[3:15:54] <jeecay> I live in my head....AM I A WOMAN?
[3:15:57] <finaltrinity5> that's the definition of "lost in my feelings"
[3:15:59] <cherubsanonymous> Who isn't?
[3:16:03] <FauxGateau> there's too much in the way for me to deal with to just talk
[3:16:07] <carlosmanriquez> big anxiety
[3:16:11] <FauxGateau> yes
[3:16:14] <@dcn2049> definitely are
[3:16:20] <person181> i think most men take things at a surface value and dont dig to deep
[3:16:20] <jeecay> anxiety power go
[3:16:51] <+WhyIDie> if there was ever a time for woolie to pop out screaming "JUST TALK"
[3:16:55] <+yuppie_water> Well women are taught to be passive so the way they can be aggressive is to be passive-aggressive.
[3:16:59] <cherubsanonymous> VVoman
[3:17:01] <PsychedelicRev> That is a fantastic quality that I wish people did
[3:17:01] <+VulgarVigil> Are you attempting to imply that I'm insecure? Such accusations are most uncouth sir. I am now on my way to declaring war on Kentucky to show how secure I am.
[3:17:06] <jeecay> Peach is proof that "just talk" works
[3:17:11] <+dickbuttwoman> I take the John Mulaney approach of "I'm going to hold all my emotions deep down here, and then I'll die"
[3:17:16] <FauxGateau> i mean we're getting into armchair psychology but people are complicated
[3:17:19] <finaltrinity5> yo high school girl drama is the wildest shit
[3:17:22] <+Bacon_Rage> alpha paige PogChamp
[3:17:30] <T_Sasquatch> you cant "just talk" a person that doesn't want to talk to you
[3:17:33] <finaltrinity5> I just look back like "how the fuck did they have time for that"
[3:17:47] <jeecay> @FauxGateau stupid. people are supid
[3:17:52] <+modmanawesome69> this is why you gotta just find an endless supply of BBC guys off of grindr and never make emotional connections apatDab apatDab
[3:17:53] <+Nefarious_Bear> you have all the time in the world for drama in highschol
[3:17:55] <%Cogito1001> @dickbuttwoman Try the Nathan Fielder approch, of tricking them into leasing a condo.
[3:17:59] <FauxGateau> they just don't understand is all
[3:18:12] <FauxGateau> it's not stupidity it's more ignorance.
[3:18:12] <+Nefarious_Bear> you can coast through highschool super hard, which leaves plenty of time for social drama
[3:18:24] <+dickbuttwoman> @Cogito1001 Oh, I gotta try that one time. Sounds much more healthy and lucrative.
[3:18:28] <%Cogito1001> Works everytime

[3:19:18] <Futurecity10> There always this one comic panel I remember. Its two dudes on a step talking about relationships between guys and girls. The example they give is a group of 5 guys and 5 girls are given the task of lifting a box. The guys will all lift the box and for the woman, only 2-3 will lift the box whilst the other 2 pretend to lift it
[3:19:25] <+dickbuttwoman> "My neck breaks SO easily!"

[3:21:23] <carlosmanriquez> but tits tho
[3:21:27] <OrangeGameCinema> Without makeup women look more like men than men
[3:21:29] <Nineless> Men minus beards?
[3:21:30] <Coystick> You can always guess by the shoulders
[3:21:33] <+WhyIDie> on the other side of it, there's those men that look like women
[3:21:38] <PsychedelicRev> All secrets, revealed. Revelations...
[3:21:51] <Cazador115> @jeecay Can confirm. I often inhabit caves and crave gold.
[3:21:54] <+dickbuttwoman> "BUT I'M PRETTIER NOW"
[3:22:02] <T_Sasquatch> its more like we are used to seeing women in make up
[3:22:04] <FauxGateau> i prefer the no make up but if you want it.
[3:22:05] <+modmanawesome69> Blue lipstick or riot....
[3:22:08] <%Cogito1001> Eli probably looks pretty in red lipstick
[3:22:19] <finaltrinity5> yeah I ain't really about lipstick but who am I to judge
[3:22:22] <person181> small amounts are fine
[3:22:24] <%Gaagaagi> what sucks is when you meet a girls dad and realize she has her dads face
[3:22:27] <+Probliterator> Makeup just makes them taste weird when you lick their face.
[3:22:33] <jeecay> @Cazador115 LOL.
[3:22:34] <halfway_noctural> feminine men are obviously the way to go
[3:22:38] <T_Sasquatch> @Gaagaagi LUL ruined forever
[3:22:39] <+wasson_g> territorial display.
[3:22:40] <finaltrinity5> @probliterator that's facts
[3:22:41] <JoeNeutrino> @Gaagaagi ouch
[3:22:51] <+yuppie_water> like, matte or gloss tho?
[3:22:51] <carlosmanriquez> @Cogito1001 yeah but it'd had to be pretty faded, a very strong red would overpower his pasty face
[3:22:56] <+daveronald> baboon asses
[3:22:58] <+Nefarious_Bear> @PeachSaliva Have you ever had a girl get mad when you critique their look like that. I once said to a girl that her new glasses weren't as good as the old ones (NICELY) and she cried
[3:23:07] <+VulgarVigil> Modern make-up practices are just the tradition of war paint being carried on by the modern world
[3:23:24] <%Cogito1001> Nah the contrast would be what would sell it
[3:23:26] <FauxGateau> lol better not to comment at all bear
[3:23:32] <+dickbuttwoman> Or as plague calls them "The time of the great de-masculization"
[3:23:37] <Nineless> Well before then it was all about everyone powdering their faces and fake beauty marks.
[3:23:38] <%Cogito1001> Go for the pennywise look
[3:23:39] <+Shaggnar> Phrasing
[3:23:44] <jeecay> @VulgarVigil hmmmm maybe i can use war paint to hide my baldness :P
[3:23:46] <+WhyIDie> was it the elizabethan times when they bit their lips to get a red color to them to attract men? unsure when that was
[3:23:47] <T_Sasquatch> so women use makeup to enhance themselves others depend on makeup
[3:23:50] <carlosmanriquez> @Cogito1001 FANART INCOMING
[3:24:07] <%Cogito1001> 100%
[3:24:09] <person181> lucky for me i have no idea on who i am as a person
[3:24:14] <Zaphire_Saucypants> aaaaay the Stalker song
[3:24:17] <Huntercd> stalker song
[3:24:21] <carlosmanriquez> maybe she was in bad spot
[3:24:26] <halfway_noctural> stop caring
[3:24:33] <finaltrinity5> is it dimples
[3:24:42] <+VulgarVigil> @jeecay Just go for the full Star Trek Klingon look :^)
[3:24:43] <FauxGateau> break through the shame barrier then become strong as hell.
[3:24:52] <Nineless> Eyes.
[3:24:53] <+Nefarious_Bear> I mean the girl I was talking about is basically always in a bad spot so that may explain it LUL
[3:24:56] <T_Sasquatch> her massive forehead Kappa
[3:25:06] <+Shaggnar> Everyone hates their nose
[3:25:10] <+BopBeep> Plague just successfully got out of that trap
[3:25:17] <%Cogito1001> Shes insecure about her HIDEOUS BOOTS
[3:25:18] <jeecay> @VulgarVigil then i can tell people i don't like to suck the ridges
[3:25:24] <+Bro_Dzee> I had the guy who was taking my passport photo point out how misaligned my eyes are
[3:25:25] <+Nefarious_Bear> Paige dont let anyone shame you about your POWERFUL JAW
[3:25:29] <+WhyIDie> insignificant, like pores
[3:25:29] <+lols_royce> gotta be the earlobes
[3:25:37] <finaltrinity5> thin lips?
[3:25:40] <FauxGateau> just own it and fuck those people.
[3:25:46] <person181> this is why i never look at mysef
[3:25:49] <+dickbuttwoman> Go talk to an 8th grader
[3:25:51] <gamma_wavve> weird ankles
[3:25:57] <+dickbuttwoman> They'll get to the thing about you that you don't like
[3:25:58] <FauxGateau> i broke every mirror in my house.
[3:26:00] <finaltrinity5> dimples?
[3:26:02] <%Cogito1001> T H I C C L I P
[3:26:03] <+Nefarious_Bear> I hate how big my cheeks look when I smile, that's about it I think
[3:26:06] <+InhumanMilitia> Howdy y'all, how you doin?
[3:26:08] <ehStuGatz> paige has those DSLs
[3:26:14] <+TECHNO_OUTLAW> eye brows
[3:26:16] <+Nefarious_Bear> vinejoelNut
[3:26:22] <FauxGateau> im alright
[3:26:25] <jeecay> I don't like looking at myself in the mirror. but that's just cause I fear the reflection will reach out and kill me.
[3:26:30] <T_Sasquatch> I am still guessing forehead
[3:26:30] <finaltrinity5> man every time I see the term DSL I burst out laughing
[3:26:35] <carlosmanriquez> even your own face
[3:26:35] <Nineless> LUL
[3:26:36] <@dcn2049> haha nice
[3:26:38] <PsychedelicRev> Too often Eli
[3:26:39] <OrangeGameCinema> For me thats every word
[3:26:40] <+ChimeraGryph> mandella effect?
[3:26:42] <piggypig> CHEESE IS AN ANIMAL
[3:26:43] <vonmaultke> Plague thats too close to home
[3:26:44] <hntronium> Mandela effect
[3:26:48] <T_Sasquatch> almost every day
[3:26:55] <vonmaultke> I can't remember my mothers face
[3:26:57] <FrithnanthH> @plagueofgripes I hope that at some point in a TNG stream you might draw Spock summoning Satan, like he did that one time
[3:27:04] <finaltrinity5> yo stoplights are actually fuckin huge
[3:27:08] <+WhyIDie> like that feeling when you say the word so many times it stops being a word?
[3:27:13] <+InhumanMilitia> loony tunes or toons
[3:27:14] <FauxGateau> plague got ego death from looking at a toliet
[3:27:14] <%Freonade> remembering how to tie a shoe
[3:27:18] <carlosmanriquez> @FrithnanthH wait what?
[3:27:20] <+VulgarVigil> Either a sign of too much or too little insight Kappa
[3:27:22] <+wasson_g> he had a Lucid Transcendental Toilet Moment.'
[3:27:33] <halfway_noctural> INSIGHT GAINED
[3:27:33] <VirtuaRailith> I had a good time playing warframe with the plauge and peach podcast in the background
[3:27:58] <T_Sasquatch> or there are times when i saw english words and I imagine them sounding foreign
[3:28:00] <+dickbuttwoman> Her hair?
[3:28:01] <+modmanawesome69> well what the hell is it?
[3:28:05] <vonmaultke> bad skin?
[3:28:20] <T_Sasquatch> thicc forehead
[3:28:21] <bloodypurpledog> A secret butthole behind your left eye?
[3:28:25] <PsychedelicRev> Wonderful powers of observation
[3:28:29] <finaltrinity5> shes got an extra pair of eye lids
[3:28:30] <+WhyIDie> is it the unceasing flow of blood from your eye sockets? it doesn't look that bad
[3:28:39] <+Nefarious_Bear> speaking of word sounds I used to think epitome was pronounced "eppy-tome"
[3:28:43] <FrithnanthH> @carlosmanriquez Don't you remember the time Spock drew a Pentagram and summoned the Devil?
[3:28:50] <+TinoPepino24> is it the fat around the neck?
[3:28:53] <+dickbuttwoman> "Nobody fucking cares. And if they do, they're petty and ain't worth your time"
[3:28:53] <+Nefarious_Bear> I got ripped a new one when my friends heard me pronounce it LUL
[3:29:05] <finaltrinity5> @nefarious_bear that's not that bad, when you think about the word epitaph
[3:29:18] <finaltrinity5> but also get rekt lmao
[3:29:22] <T_Sasquatch> @Nefarious_Bear i struggle pronouncing crispy
[3:29:22] <jeecay> is it a scar that reminds you of the battle in which you lost your super powers?

[3:30:11] <Nineless> What's hair?
[3:30:11] <VirtuaRailith> Even my flaws are meeee
[3:30:12] <FrithnanthH> @carlosmanriquez It's the animated series, that's where the really weird stuff happens

[3:30:28] <sosuke5> You could do a lot worse tbh
[3:30:29] <awalr> bread pit
[3:30:31] <+VulgarVigil> Is it time for transhumanism already?
[3:30:31] <Samex_Comex> You are handsome to me
[3:30:32] <vonmaultke> Chome me daddy
[3:30:35] <Huntercd> Paige with a fade tessPURR
[3:30:37] <FauxGateau> nah that'd be horrible.
[3:30:40] <gamma_wavve> a better body who wouldnt want that
[3:30:44] <+Shaggnar> But Plague is handsome as fuck
[3:30:47] <+Nefarious_Bear> 1 in 6 people have the herps
[3:30:48] <FauxGateau> cause you'd never konw if people were being serious
[3:30:49] <+dickbuttwoman> Got that herpalerp
[3:30:52] <onesleepymonkey> implying plague doesn't have herpes.
[3:30:56] <carlosmanriquez> @FrithnanthH i've been on the fence on watching TAS but now i will
[3:30:57] <PiCheese> LUL
[3:30:59] <+WhyIDie> drowning in the herps
[3:30:59] <Laecerelius> Gotta Admech it up and get me some cyberdongs
[3:31:05] <hntronium> I bet Paige has Herpes
[3:31:07] <Paralurx> AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAIDS
[3:31:09] <+wasson_g> he just wants his ego placed into a Cybrid Warrior.
[3:31:13] <carlosmanriquez> prettaids
[3:31:15] <FrithnanthH> @carlosmanriquez It's pretty goofy
[3:31:18] <finaltrinity5> LOL
[3:31:19] <+wasson_g> then...you'll all pay.
[3:31:31] <%Cogito1001> Rich Evans definately has herpes and diabetes
[3:31:32] <+VulgarVigil> I'll get the hacksaw and steel sheets. It's robot ascension time
[3:31:34] <FauxGateau> haha
[3:31:35] <JoeNeutrino> Just imagine her ruined vagina and you don't feel so intimidated
[3:31:36] <+Nefarious_Bear> the worst part about herps is that condoms dont even protect against them well
[3:31:37] <PsychedelicRev> Descaling the intimidation factor
[3:31:37] <Raconteur999> imagine weeping blisters in their underwear
[3:31:39] <FauxGateau> so mature
[3:31:40] <+WhyIDie> so that's a public speaking tip? imagine everyone in the room has herpes
[3:31:43] <sosuke5> Good job, Todd
[3:31:47] <Nineless> Nah, am not.
[3:31:53] <jeecay> Paige: Awful human. Superb superhero
[3:31:53] <Paralurx> "I'm not horribly immoral, I'm just QUIRKY"
[3:31:56] <FauxGateau> just spread rumors about them
[3:31:59] <Ginsan31> no i`m not awful LUL
[3:32:01] <FauxGateau> like a hero
[3:32:04] <+dickbuttwoman> Imagining them doing sonic cosplay
[3:32:06] <carlosmanriquez> @FrithnanthH star trek is pretty goofy though, most of it's not badly animated
[3:32:09] <+Shaggnar> "Oh no, he's hot"
[3:32:09] <finaltrinity5> I don't care that you have herpes, I care that you're a DOUCHECANOE
[3:32:11] <+wasson_g> that's why u gotta stick to 2d girls.
[3:32:15] <+wasson_g> they're so clean....
[3:32:16] <halfway_noctural> nobody ever expects the herpes
[3:32:24] <jeecay> sucker punch them in the gut like wolverine did cyclops
[3:32:29] <Nineless> Picture them in old timey swimsuits.
[3:32:31] <Raconteur999> that's how Houdini died!
[3:32:38] <+modmanawesome69> sonic cosplay?
[3:32:42] <finaltrinity5> @nineless shit I'm into that though
[3:32:43] <+VulgarVigil> Physical violence is the foundation of most of my lasting friendships :^)
[3:32:45] <gamma_wavve> giant monoeyes
[3:32:45] <FauxGateau> it'll get me porked up
[3:32:46] <+Nefarious_Bear> anatomically correct sonic cosplays
[3:32:48] <%Cogito1001> Anyone see that new sonic poster that looks like he came on the san francisco bridge
[3:32:51] <person181> but what if it's sonicFOX cosplay?
[3:32:56] <PsychedelicRev> With reason
[3:32:58] <+dickbuttwoman> @Cogito1001 Everyone saw it
[3:33:03] <Nineless> finaltrinity5 Blue and white horizontal stripes, from neck to knee!
[3:33:04] <Paralurx> Not since the incident...
[3:33:06] <+dickbuttwoman> @Cogito1001 Nobody liked that.
[3:33:06] <Ginsan31> so Plague are you telling us to punch people so we can start having a relationship?
[3:33:06] <JoeNeutrino> I assume everyone's seen the design of movie SOnic.
[3:33:10] <kell_twit> for good reason
[3:33:14] <hntronium> The bridge one?
[3:33:17] <+dickbuttwoman> SONIC WUZ HERE
[3:33:17] <JoeNeutrino> With his creepy human legs.
[3:33:21] <+Nefarious_Bear> I just want to see Jim Carey as DR ROBOTNIK
[3:33:23] <%Cogito1001> I loved it. Its so aweful
[3:33:24] <OrangeGameCinema> OMG that poster was real??
[3:33:27] <OrangeGameCinema> I saw that
[3:33:28] <halfway_noctural> all strong relationships start with a good punch
[3:33:28] <+yotsubach4n> looks bad
[3:33:29] <gamma_wavve> the legs looked detached from his body its super weird
[3:33:29] <Raconteur999> the bridge one from Sonic's crotch-view
[3:33:32] <+wasson_g> for gay pride. cuz sonic is gay now.
[3:33:38] <+lols_royce> no socks though?
[3:33:38] <+dickbuttwoman> Thank you for being offended for me, Plague
[3:33:40] <person181> ya but neither does sega
[3:33:42] <%Cogito1001> This movie is gonna be busfire abortion
[3:33:42] <FauxGateau> it'll make money
[3:33:42] <OrangeGameCinema> I thought it was fan made as a joke
[3:33:46] <cherubsanonymous> Being Sega
[3:33:52] <jeecay> @PlagueOfGripes it's so they can reenact the first level of sonic adventure 2
[3:34:02] <carlosmanriquez> and make a horrible abomination to the lord with the beloved mascot
[3:34:08] <+Shaggnar> When even Sonicteam knows it's trash that's bad
[3:34:11] <+VulgarVigil> It honestly feels like Paramount is putting more effort into looking like they're not putting effort into the movie than anything else
[3:34:12] <+Nefarious_Bear> Eggette is the best Sonic OC
[3:34:18] <Coystick> SHE EXISTS
[3:34:18] <OrangeGameCinema> Its sad how Sonic OVA is the only good sonic movie
[3:34:22] <FauxGateau> hollywood is burning to the ground so they'll try anything at this point.
[3:34:23] <+wasson_g> that'll be the big reveal in the movie, sonic nad eggman kiss for the first time.
[3:34:24] <+WhyIDie> hollywood got their herpes-covered mitts on monster hunter FeelsBadMan
[3:34:24] <@Nightbot> Plague is a youtube animator and also streams at https://picarto.tv/Plague . Also: t-shirts! http://goo.gl/lze8QO
[3:34:31] <+Nefarious_Bear> is Captain Vidya gonna be there?
[3:34:33] <Coystick> MAKE. EGGETTE. CANON.
[3:34:34] <+lols_royce> do you think that he runs the sonic twitter himself in the movie?
[3:34:35] <Paralurx> Ugandan Knuckles should be in it
[3:34:37] <+dickbuttwoman> We're all just waiting for what the Sonic Twitter is gonna say
[3:34:44] <jeecay> It better have mecha sonic
[3:34:47] <carlosmanriquez> is that eggman with the bowsette hat?
[3:34:51] <FauxGateau> it's pretty funny tho
[3:34:57] <Nineless> Nothing, but imagine pretty people have herpes.
[3:35:01] <@dcn2049> He's mean to those he likes the most, or some bullshit.
[3:35:05] <carlosmanriquez> climbing a pool

[3:37:02] <Paralurx> I love how dumb our language is
[3:37:07] <+5Two> P'Sylocke is my favorite X Man
[3:37:15] <jeecay> I remember reading the word stomach and thinking it was a diffrent word pronounced Stum-match
[3:37:15] <+Nefarious_Bear> Japanese is a fucking mess too, woo boy. I took it for 4 years
[3:37:16] <Raconteur999> English is the bastard child of like 500 fathers
[3:37:27] <Laecerelius> English is a trash fire and it’s great
[3:37:30] <jiin6> its all about meeee
[3:37:32] <finaltrinity5> fishing for complements lol
[3:37:32] <+wasson_g> i couldn't remember how to spell "rumor" earlier....
[3:37:34] <Ginsan31> dude the rules of english are so dumb
[3:37:34] <+Nefarious_Bear> HOPE YOU LIKE 2000 KANJI CHARACTERS
[3:37:37] <Coystick> meeeeeeeeeee
[3:37:40] <gamma_wavve> fuck kanji
[3:37:42] <editorsebas> English has messed up phonetics!
[3:37:43] <+Shaggnar> English is mostly just just French and Latin with a weird German base to it
[3:37:49] <jeecay> @Raconteur999 english is the son of a filthy whore
[3:37:57] <PsychedelicRev> It is. English is the most complicated mess of Historical production
[3:38:01] <+Nefarious_Bear> Japanese would be much easier if kanji was just removed
[3:38:02] <Desertfishing> plague is the prettiest girl in town
[3:38:05] <$Cardboard96> vinejoelThink
[3:38:05] <carlosmanriquez> as a spanish talking person english is fucking weird and spanish is just a pain in the ass
[3:38:05] <Raconteur999> mmm, but a sexy one
[3:38:06] <jiin6> English is a dumpster fire of an language
[3:38:09] <vonmaultke> Fishing for compliments pvpSass
[3:38:09] <FauxGateau> more like who dares cares.
[3:38:13] <+Bacon_Rage> starRaph
[3:38:27] <+VulgarVigil> Gotta really appreciate the strong foundation for English laid out by Shakespeare, France and Germany
[3:38:35] <Paralurx> YEEEAAHEAAAA
[3:38:39] <Ginsan31> na dude english ignores all the rules of Latin and made rules on the fly
[3:38:51] <%Cogito1001> Bantastic Bidea
[3:38:58] <finaltrinity5> oh wow yeah there is definitely a dude background going YEAHYEAHYEAHEAHYEAH
[3:38:58] <+modmanawesome69> on the co-op yall did
[3:39:00] <$KamiKiryu> pogchamp100
[3:39:01] <Ginsan31> in Latin words are pronounce as they are written
[3:39:03] <jeecay> Paige was working them brute smarts in portal
[3:39:03] <+Nefarious_Bear> Paige finished the single player, but not the multiplayer
[3:39:14] <PsychedelicRev> English uses the rules of Old English/Norse, and Latin and French etc
[3:39:14] <jiin6> pat doesn't help
[3:39:17] <Huntercd> Paige beat the game
[3:39:18] <finaltrinity5> LOL
[3:39:20] <+dickbuttwoman> The idea of a shitting, giggling cunt is
[3:39:21] <+Nefarious_Bear> Watching Paige fail at puzzles is the best/worst
[3:39:23] <+dickbuttwoman> Pretty good
[3:39:27] <@dcn2049> I imagine playing with pat is worse than playing with huggles was
[3:39:31] <Piemono> Jiren?
[3:39:34] <ECRead> SHADOW PUZZLES
[3:39:35] <finaltrinity5> Leave Jiren to Paigr
[3:39:35] <jeecay> Pat is the master of negative reinforcement
[3:39:38] <Paralurx> Just do the puzzle gooder, Paige
[3:39:38] <+Nefarious_Bear> It'll never, EVER be as bad as when Paige had to do the Susie puzzle in Deltarune
[3:39:44] <FauxGateau> i miss fuggins!
[3:39:50] <FauxGateau> roll him out
[3:39:56] <Raconteur999> so can we get Paige and Jenna Marbles doing the co-op for Portal 2?
[3:40:04] <+Nefarious_Bear> "what do I do" she says as the puzzle is RIGHT IN FRONT OF HER
[3:40:11] <SkullyIsDie> Bad depth perception?
[3:40:15] <%Cogito1001> I like the idea that fuggins is in storage until needed.
[3:40:24] <FunkyRot> i gotta bannana slamma jamma off to bed, later plague and Paige and everyone else
[3:40:27] <jeecay> Everyone's jealous of her brute smarts
[3:40:35] <carlosmanriquez> @PeachSaliva something weird happens with you a pat, his wierd bullshit doesn't mask yours like with woolie or mat, it gets even more out there
[3:40:44] <gamma_wavve> the sooner the better on that lasik
[3:40:52] <+dickbuttwoman> Gotta do the big fails
[3:41:00] <gamma_wavve> get that shit outta the way
[3:41:03] <PsychedelicRev> Gotta bait donations Paige
[3:41:04] <Ginsan31> Paige did you beated Blood Borne? I think I saw you play it once
[3:41:04] <+Nefarious_Bear> the process of lasik is kinda horrifying. They slice open the lid of your eye
[3:41:12] <$Cardboard96> doing shit is funny
[3:41:14] <+Nefarious_Bear> and shoot LASERS at it
[3:41:26] <Paralurx> Avoiding a super helpful procedure that would improve your life so you won't get embarrassed.
[3:41:27] <jeecay> Maybe if Paige fixes her eyes Pat will finally fix his nose
[3:41:28] <+dickbuttwoman> But paige, the definition of a "good job" in this industry is fucking everything up spectacularly on camera
[3:41:29] <Paralurx> What an hero
[3:41:30] <finaltrinity5> definitely all a ruse
[3:41:43] <+Bacon_Rage> no ones this bad :)
[3:41:46] <Raconteur999> and sizzle away the extra eye humor until the curve is right
[3:41:59] <FauxGateau> haha if that were the case. id probably lose all faith in humanity
[3:42:04] <finaltrinity5> hey @plagueofgripes who's doing this cover
[3:42:06] <FauxGateau> luckily it's not.
[3:42:08] <jeecay> Toilet reading is the best reading
[3:42:22] <Zelwrig> hello ♥
[3:42:26] <jeecay> That woman went full muppet. you never go full muppet
[3:42:34] <+Nefarious_Bear> Paige could you walk us through your brain process of you utterly failing that one Deltarune puzzle
[3:42:44] <+5Two> There are several videos of people doing that
[3:42:50] <kara_lin> haaaaaiiiiiiiiii~~~
[3:42:53] <FauxGateau> i mean of course that's a thing
[3:42:56] <finaltrinity5> twitch acting is definitely a thing
[3:43:04] <FauxGateau> that's your lively hood
[3:43:11] <jeecay> ah twitch acting. like low tier god?
[3:43:14] <%Cogito1001> Then why is pat on there
[3:43:16] <finaltrinity5> but pat is the biggest liar
[3:43:21] <sosuke5> You lie all the time
[3:43:22] <+dickbuttwoman> That taste... it's the taste of a liar
[3:43:22] <Paralurx> CHAT WILL SMELL YOUR BULLSHIT
[3:43:22] <+modmanawesome69> I like the video of the dude reseting lets go to get a shiny mewtwo then once he gets it, it was when he was looking away for a second and didn't notice it.
[3:43:24] <+Nefarious_Bear> Dr. Disrespect your wife
[3:43:34] <jiin6> I lie to you too plague
[3:43:34] <Samex_Comex> What how could you Plague!
[3:43:35] <+dickbuttwoman> WE ALL KNOW ABOUT YOUR FURRY PORN PLAGUE
[3:43:42] <Raconteur999> Couch was forged by Hephaestus
[3:43:43] <$Cardboard96> "I lie to my chat all the time" is that a lie? vinejoelThink vinejoelThink
[3:43:46] <finaltrinity5> yeah you call him out and then he turns it around on you lol
[3:43:48] <FauxGateau> lies are a virtue in this world.
[3:43:49] <finaltrinity5> every time
[3:43:50] <jeecay> I thought woolie was the biggest lier. Pat's the biggest cheater
[3:44:01] <+Nefarious_Bear> Plague has like 2 yottabytes of furry porn that he'll never share with the internet
[3:44:04] <PsychedelicRev> Twitch, the stage for smelling lies
[3:44:06] <jiin6> pat's the biggest baby
[3:44:12] <%maledictus_faust> you have to believe the lie is true
[3:44:13] <Firemane1279> This is the Global Stage bitch gennaSmug gennaSmug gennaSmug
[3:44:16] <Paralurx> Wait how can you say not to lie on stream when you've had Woolie over on a stream before?
[3:44:20] <+VulgarVigil> And the biggest twist of all, the Great Fence Chronicle was all a ruse to divert attention from... something...
[3:44:25] <+dickbuttwoman> What the fuck is dramaturgey?
[3:44:37] <finaltrinity5> writing scripts for stage play?
[3:44:38] <carlosmanriquez> @PeachSaliva does pat lie or is it just him super sure about the wrong thing he thinks he knows?
[3:44:41] <FauxGateau> yeah
[3:44:45] <Ginsan31> drama what?
[3:44:46] <%maledictus_faust> magical screaming
[3:44:47] <jeecay> @dickbuttwoman Magic activated via drama?
[3:44:57] <jiin6> Pat's wrong and he lies about it
[3:44:57] <+Nefarious_Bear> The first word's of Woolie's new podcast was "I lied" LUL
[3:44:59] <Raconteur999> @PlagueOfGripes will this be colored or line art?
[3:45:02] <+WhyIDie> I'd imagine it's probably similar to a dramasmith
[3:45:05] <jeecay> acting so hard you manifest a fireball
[3:45:12] <+dickbuttwoman> Oh, so, like, writing a closet drama or whatever
[3:45:18] <%Cogito1001> PAts lying is legendary, him scamming games outta of stores before release is the best
[3:45:22] <FauxGateau> yeah it's learning to write plays
[3:45:33] <FauxGateau> stage directions and actor postions
[3:45:33] <gamma_wavve> hows it spelled drama chergy?
[3:45:35] <%Cogito1001> Hes like spiderman villian in the 60s
[3:45:38] <+lols_royce> oh playing 1 store against the other? that was hilarious
[3:45:42] <finaltrinity5> what like he let you audit the class?
[3:45:56] <+dickbuttwoman> Plague, what's your favorite play?
[3:46:10] <%maledictus_faust> these bird folk always disturb me
[3:46:12] <FauxGateau> anything by shaw.
[3:46:19] <PsychedelicRev> That's a great professor to come across, they are great and too few
[3:46:20] <carlosmanriquez> @Cogito1001 yeah but he lies to people he hates like the oustide people
[3:46:25] <finaltrinity5> yo he let you fuck off with the prereqs, that's an OG
[3:46:34] <jeecay> He wanted some plague booty :P
[3:46:45] <carlosmanriquez> oh my
[3:46:46] <%Cogito1001> He'll also lie if it ges him something he wants
[3:46:50] <Paralurx> He saw the furry art and thought "I wanna hang with THIS guy for a semester"
[3:47:00] <Ginsan31> was Plague working on a new story?
[3:47:02] <+Nefarious_Bear> Plague saw "Cats" and the rest was history
[3:47:09] <carlosmanriquez> that's truw
[3:47:11] <carlosmanriquez> truw
[3:47:14] <carlosmanriquez> true
[3:47:14] <Coystick> @Nefarious_Bear new lore
[3:47:20] <+Nefarious_Bear> truw LUL
[3:47:22] <FauxGateau> He loves brigadoon
[3:47:23] <%Cogito1001> Makes too much sense
[3:47:24] <carlosmanriquez> 3rd time's the charm
[3:47:29] <Raconteur999> The book was better
[3:47:32] <+dickbuttwoman> I am a big fan of Faust by Goethe
[3:47:37] <jeecay> When are we gonna see an onstage adaption of jackie chan's Police Story?
[3:47:55] <T_Sasquatch> i can READ
[3:47:55] <finaltrinity5> I do think there is value in being well read. theres def more value in not being a jackass
[3:47:59] <+SpiceMustF1ow> MacBeth
[3:47:59] <Ginsan31> dude I can`t get into reading books
[3:48:00] <%maledictus_faust> reading makes you a worse person, just agree to terms of service and move on
[3:48:06] <PsychedelicRev> Yes
[3:48:07] <Vladimir_Lemon> Antigone was one, yeah?
[3:48:20] <FauxGateau> faust is tell me to sign something again.
[3:48:22] <carlosmanriquez> @PeachSaliva i fell super dumb i didn't understand any words you said
[3:48:23] <piggypig> i like flowers for algernon
[3:48:28] <Huntercd> The Greek gods were assholes
[3:48:32] <%Cogito1001> Reading makes you a nerd. And no one wants to be a nerd. AMIRTIE?
[3:48:39] <T_Sasquatch> i used to read , then i found the internet and video games
[3:48:51] <Coystick> Whom is Agamennon
[3:48:52] <%maledictus_faust> c'mon if you sign your life will be so much better @fauxgateau
[3:49:01] <PsychedelicRev> The Greek style of the 3 play set.
[3:49:01] <carlosmanriquez> @Cogito1001 yes, you are tie
[3:49:04] <jeecay> @Coystick sounds like a digimon
[3:49:09] <person181> i had teachers pass me just cuz i read books in class
[3:49:09] <FauxGateau> sounds legit to me.
[3:49:14] <Huntercd> Fuck Agamemnon
[3:49:27] <%maledictus_faust> trust me BloodTrail
[3:49:32] <%Cogito1001> @carlosmanriquez Go back to watching Patrick Stewards head get caressed
[3:49:35] <T_Sasquatch> Agamemnon sounds like a rare pokemon LUL
[3:49:44] <Ginsan31> I have aphantasia so reading books is extra hard for me
[3:49:46] <hntronium> IIRC it was because they couldn't get to Troy and he had to sacrifice her so the storms would settle?
[3:49:46] <$Cardboard96> happy story :)
[3:49:49] <jeecay> LOL. The condition is to run up to the first thing you see and immediately kill it. the gods are psychopaths
[3:49:49] <jiin6> Bathtub Death
[3:49:52] <%maledictus_faust> it's a mutated aggron
[3:49:53] <carlosmanriquez> @Cogito1001 please link
[3:49:56] <+dickbuttwoman> So, this is a comedy, right?
[3:50:05] <Ginsan31> comic books are more aphantasia friendly
[3:50:06] <%maledictus_faust> this is actually tragedy
[3:50:07] <PsychedelicRev> Stabbed right in the bathtub
[3:50:12] <%Cogito1001> 9.95$ Credit only
[3:50:14] <jiin6> God's were assholes
[3:50:19] <Paralurx> Wow, Paige is a apatBig fucking nerd
[3:50:21] <T_Sasquatch> GODS
[3:50:22] <+InhumanMilitia> im seeing this story as a jojo episode lol
[3:50:26] <%maledictus_faust> gourds
[3:50:30] <carlosmanriquez> @Cogito1001 you drive a hard bargain
[3:50:36] <FauxGateau> paige knows a lot about things you wouldn't think
[3:50:45] <+MagickBurritoh> is it just Kratos?
[3:50:51] <jeecay> He got psychoed
[3:50:58] <PsychedelicRev> Then it continues into the Libation Bearers, if I remember right
[3:51:07] <juicysal> The tragedy is that no wedding happens.
[3:51:30] <+dickbuttwoman> "Sonic the hedgehog is better than people give it credit for"
[3:51:31] <%maledictus_faust> zeus used his stand Bolts for all to defeat the antagonist, the true heart of mankind
[3:51:39] <jiin6> FAKE CASSANDRA NEWS
[3:51:40] <jeecay> She's got a reverse jojo's power

[3:52:12] <sosuke5> RED SUN OVER PARADISE
[3:52:12] <jeecay> nite
[3:52:13] <Paralurx> Lucid Paige is apatBig SMART
[3:52:14] <PsychedelicRev> Night man
[3:52:15] <finaltrinity5> its 3 am where you live paige lol
[3:52:20] <person181> nite dude
[3:52:29] <jeecay> Paige is at peak brute smarts right now
[3:52:40] <jiin6> this man's blood is Ribbons
[3:52:52] <+dickbuttwoman> You shouldn't push your hand too hard plague
[3:52:59] <Huntercd> Her daughter Electra killed her right?
[3:53:00] <%maledictus_faust> let's be powerful and fuck? what a notion
[3:53:03] <jeecay> "Lets be powerful together and fuck" anyone that says this to me will have me.
[3:53:12] <Raconteur999> that's what kills him, too many ribbons in his veins
[3:53:24] <+dickbuttwoman> The "Triune"?
[3:53:30] <finaltrinity5> wait isnt this the song you used in the dark souls parody?
[3:53:36] <PsychedelicRev> The Greeks wrote 3 plays that are meant to be preformed in a single day
[3:53:39] <%maledictus_faust> 9/10 doctors recommend ribbons in your veins
[3:53:40] <+PandLantis> An Omnibus?
[3:53:52] <Raconteur999> the tenth doctor died
[3:54:06] <+Nefarious_Bear> What did you major in Paige?
[3:54:17] <Paralurx> No ragrets Paige
[3:54:19] <+dickbuttwoman> "That's why I studied 18th century German Closet Dramas!"
[3:54:20] <sosuke5> no ragret
[3:54:24] <%maledictus_faust> it's a
[3:54:27] <Ginsan31> real jobs suck bro
[3:54:28] <@Nightbot> Plague is a youtube animator and also streams at https://picarto.tv/Plague . Also: t-shirts! http://goo.gl/lze8QO
[3:54:34] <jiin6> John Hurt is Technically the 9th doctor
[3:54:59] <jeecay> so paige defeats her lupis and gets her powers back?
[3:55:03] <%maledictus_faust> I would literally do nothing all day every day.
[3:55:08] <T_Sasquatch> You can always just sit down and read about it at home instead of wasting money on a college course for something so niche
[3:55:20] <Ginsan31> I would just draw
[3:55:27] <Raconteur999> can we stop 9-11?
[3:55:29] <Coystick> whack it
[3:55:39] <+Nefarious_Bear> Paige you cant solve simple puzzles you think you can solve murders
[3:55:45] <FauxGateau> i would probably whack it too
[3:55:47] <Huntercd> Officer Peach?
[3:55:52] <Coystick> The killer is right behind this shadow puzzle
[3:55:53] <jeecay> Detective paige and her muppet sidekick would be a good as tv show
[3:56:05] <+PandLantis> Ah, yes.. Good ole fashioned coercion
[3:56:08] <+Nefarious_Bear> @Coystick [sweating intensifies]
[3:56:10] <+Shaggnar> Human intelligence. I have a friend in the army who does that
[3:56:21] <FauxGateau> that's some dark shit
[3:56:25] <+Nefarious_Bear> The final clue is behind this playing card puzzle
[3:56:26] <%Cogito1001> Paiges Sidekick would literally be a Jim henson puppet and you all know it
[3:56:35] <person181> stocks or like art shit or something
[3:56:36] <FauxGateau> but i suppose it serves a purpose.
[3:56:37] <+Nefarious_Bear> Paige's sidekick would be a puppet of Pat
[3:56:37] <Raconteur999> you mean Pat?
[3:56:40] <+dickbuttwoman> Eli digging down deep into the uncomfortable bits of self-doubt and inhibition
[3:56:56] <Paralurx> I'm imagining when they need Paige to come in and interrogate a tough suspect somebody just gets on their phone and says "Call in the Ruby Weapon"
[3:56:57] <Raconteur999> that's redundant
[3:56:58] <FauxGateau> paige sounds like she should be a guidance counsoler
[3:56:58] <jeecay> @Cogito1001 you thinking of Pat.
[3:57:03] <%maledictus_faust> therapists have a high rate of mental illness.
[3:57:22] <gamma_wavve> ice ice baby
[3:57:28] <+Nefarious_Bear> DAISAN NO BAKUDAN
[3:57:33] <+PandLantis> Wow, that is totally a Stand
[3:57:33] <jeecay> @Paralurx That's gotta be the name of the show
[3:57:34] <PsychedelicRev> Paige, ever consider Social Work in Mental Health?
[3:57:36] <Futurecity10> Like that one robot chicken skit?
[3:57:41] <%Cogito1001> Dear god if paige did an entire stream of warframe on pats channel but using a hand puppet of pat instead of him being there, that would be the best ever
[3:57:50] <+dickbuttwoman> Man, I'd be like, fatman from MGS2 if you looked at me
[3:57:52] <sosuke5> The therapist industry is predominately women
[3:58:07] <VirtuaRailith> PAIGE SHOULD PROBABLY PLAY ACE ATTOURNEY GAMES HUH?
[3:58:09] <FauxGateau> see the psychebombs
[3:58:10] <+PandLantis> Someone draw that, quick!
[3:58:10] <jiin6> that sounds like really bad ability
[3:58:12] <jeecay> Ok chat. What's the name of Paige's stand?
[3:58:20] <Coystick> Isn't that the plot of the bunny girl anime
[3:58:21] <gamma_wavve> that's...not a stand? i feel like that already is
[3:58:26] <+modmanawesome69> sounds like a shitty Heaven's door
[3:58:28] <+PandLantis> Ginger Bomb
[3:58:29] <VirtuaRailith> It's the psychlocks in AA
[3:58:33] <FauxGateau> it is
[3:58:34] <%maledictus_faust> and then you meet the man who is a box of barely stable nitroglycerin
[3:58:35] <VirtuaRailith> you gotta unlock the truth
[3:58:37] <PsychedelicRev> The literal chains which make up an individual
[3:58:42] <Raconteur999> that's the ghost of Jacob Marley
[3:58:46] <Coystick> I'd Schol all day.
[3:59:23] <jeecay> @Peachsaliva what's the name of your stand and how much does crazy talk interfere with it.
[3:59:27] <+Nefarious_Bear> Oooh I got it! Her stand's name would be 「ＰＲＩＶＡＴＥ ＥＹＥ」 (Hall and Oates song)
[3:59:27] <+dickbuttwoman> THE GOUT
[3:59:30] <person181> @Coystick kinda one girl can predict the future to such a point that time repeats its self
[3:59:30] <jiin6> you need to give pats happy juice to him first
[3:59:31] <PsychedelicRev> Paige, specifically reading scholarship, or lab work?
[3:59:35] <FauxGateau> that's a good one bear
[3:59:37] <vladtet909> "The gout"
[3:59:49] <jeecay> @Nefarious_Bear That's pretty good
[3:59:56] <%maledictus_faust> genetic experimentation
[3:59:57] <vonmaultke> AI development PogChamp
[3:59:58] <+All_Salt> deep learning

[4:00:05] <%maledictus_faust> making cat girls
[4:00:07] <+InhumanMilitia> plague cat girl science
[4:00:08] <+dickbuttwoman> We're witnessing the creation of a JRPG bossfight
[4:00:11] <+Shadian> Plague is going to develop FEV
[4:00:17] <jiin6> will you fuck a singlarity tho
[4:00:17] <FauxGateau> oh god plague wants to start the singularity
[4:00:19] <T_Sasquatch> singularity LUL
[4:00:23] <jeecay> So eli want's that requiem stand...you know the one.
[4:00:24] <OrangeGameCinema> Plague is a man of smarts
[4:00:28] <ghettomacgyver> Heya Plague good to see you still alive and doing stuff
[4:00:37] <%Cogito1001> Pat the Philosopher = Diogenes
[4:00:39] <person181> plague is your INT or WIS higher?
[4:00:47] <+PandLantis> Mmmm.. Idk, I gotta disagree with that. Plague is very wise.
[4:00:51] <+Bro_Dzee> Just a simple man trying to make his way in the universe
[4:00:52] <jiin6> ooooo MEeeeee
[4:00:52] <DraxTD> @PeachSaliva why are you still awake woman?!
[4:00:56] <+dickbuttwoman> Plague, you're smart enough to be witty and know your limits
[4:00:57] <+Nefarious_Bear> Plague "not a furry" gripes
[4:00:59] <@Nightbot> @Cardboard96 -> No! Come on! No! [stop spamming emotes] [warning]
[4:01:01] <+PandLantis> I'd say Plague's WIS is higher, his INT is probably average.
[4:01:02] <FauxGateau> I like plague being the humble farmer.
[4:01:09] <FauxGateau> who also has wis
[4:01:09] <sosuke5> It's a sad time when you have to admit you're kind of a simpleton
[4:01:09] <Coystick> He is but a simple man, tending his furries
[4:01:13] <Raconteur999> would Medli be a "feathery"?
[4:01:14] <PsychedelicRev> To consider oneself intelligent, steps into arrogance, so I think... Is that just me?
[4:01:16] <jeecay> Do what you want plague. It's your america.
[4:01:17] <$Cardboard96> vinejoelDio
[4:01:17] <%maledictus_faust> it's his primal compulsion to create furries

[4:03:52] <PsychedelicRev> @PlagueOfGripes Loving the linework, I take great inspiration from it
[4:03:53] <jeecay> Gotta keep leveling up
[4:03:56] <+dickbuttwoman> The best artists are those that are never satisfied
[4:03:56] <vonmaultke> Eli + Science = the Island of doctor moraeu with more sexualised creatures

[4:05:00] <jeecay> No one's ever told me I was amazing...or good...or adequate
[4:05:02] <+Nefarious_Bear> Men dont get compliments that often FeelsBadMan
[4:05:11] <Zaphire_Saucypants> Oh wow Eli, you're so fuckin' greaaaat.
[4:05:17] <FauxGateau> when i do i think they're just lying to me.
[4:05:23] <FauxGateau> and they usually are
[4:05:38] <+modmanawesome69> @PeachSaliva You would be prettier if you smiled more
[4:05:40] <+dickbuttwoman> Yeah grandma clothes!
[4:05:40] <jiin6> no one wins
[4:05:43] <finaltrinity5> the most unbeatoffable stream
[4:05:52] <%Cogito1001> Men need to step up, complement each other more, and tuck their homies into bed at night
[4:05:54] <jiin6> paige looks comfy
[4:05:55] <vonmaultke> i've received 7 compliments in my adult life pvpFATTERZ
[4:05:57] <Coystick> Looking comfy is the highest form of beauty
[4:05:58] <awalr> always optimize clothes for comfy
[4:05:59] <person181> it is the glasses that make you look like a gran
[4:06:00] <finaltrinity5> the circle glasses are part of your brand at this point
[4:06:06] <LixFury> the grandma cloths make Paige a real person LUL
[4:06:06] <weightedguccigi> what LUL
[4:06:10] <Huntercd> Paige and her ugly boots

[4:06:17] <PsychedelicRev> @FauxGateau We think that a lot; don't let it get to you
[4:06:22] <+Ell1ot> Paige, you look like a creepy murderer when you smile
[4:06:22] <finaltrinity5> have you ever seen pouting anime girls
[4:06:27] <+InhumanMilitia> I just wear whats comfortable
[4:06:27] <jeecay> @PeachSaliva You would be prettier if you hit people in the teeth
[4:06:31] <Ether101_Prime> People tell me I need to smile more and always tell them "No."
[4:06:33] <jiin6> Creepy Smiles
[4:06:38] <Coystick> The nega-smile
[4:06:38] <%maledictus_faust> you're so beautiful when you're miserable, like a finch smashed under a car tire
[4:06:41] <awalr> give em the Judge Dredd
[4:06:45] <kell_twit> frowning intensifies
[4:06:58] <+Nefarious_Bear> thats super weird
[4:06:58] <jeecay> Never work retail. People are always telling you to smile
[4:06:59] <PsychedelicRev> That is creepy
[4:07:02] <suikudo> Your chin does this wierd thing when you cry
[4:07:02] <$Cardboard96> to be fair people could tell you you're a bitch if they really wanted
[4:07:06] <Coystick> The boner cry
[4:07:10] <jiin6> paige is pretty creepy tho

[4:07:50] <vonmaultke> so 70's
[4:07:53] <Coystick> Did Soulful Strut come first or did Am I the Same Girl?
[4:08:02] <Raconteur999> my favorite song is Rhapsody in Blue
[4:08:02] <%maledictus_faust> I don't cry, I just hold it in and bury it in breakfast burritos
[4:08:03] <%Cogito1001> I cried once back in 1995.
[4:08:19] <jeecay> @PlagueOfGripes What do you think of "Summer Madness"
[4:08:23] <Shadow_Jager> Is Paige on another stream?
[4:08:43] <person181> i don't cry lest i get redaculed by my family
[4:08:49] <Raconteur999> she's probably just skyped
[4:08:52] <jeecay> @Shadow_Jager 2 in fact.
[4:09:02] <gamma_wavve> a mysterious song
[4:09:23] <Coystick> Huh, I have a different version
[4:09:31] <Paralurx> I like this song's lore
[4:09:32] <Stay_Hydrated_Bot> @plagueofgripes stayhyBottle You've been live for over 4 hours. By this point in your broadcast you should have consumed at least 16oz (480mL) of water to maintain optimum hydration.
[4:09:33] <Shadow_Jager> @jeecay Really what is she doing?
[4:09:43] <+Nefarious_Bear> its like calling Fortunate Son IT AINT ME
[4:09:46] <Coystick> IT'S ON THE CD JACKET
[4:09:57] <FauxGateau> that peeves me right off
[4:10:05] <+dickbuttwoman> Am I the same girl is the name given to it after the first release
[4:10:06] <PsychedelicRev> @Nefarious_Bear Basically
[4:10:18] <awalr> "secret"
[4:10:20] <%Cogito1001> Multistream Drifting
[4:10:22] <jeecay> oops I read that wrong. sorry @Shadow_Jager
[4:10:50] <jeecay> Drink water Plague
[4:11:03] <weightedguccigi> wow
[4:11:04] <Shadow_Jager> @jeecay No problem was just wondering.
[4:11:06] <+Nefarious_Bear> LUL
[4:11:07] <weightedguccigi> LUL
[4:11:08] <Devildavacado> Oh hells yeah. Plague stream.
[4:11:10] <%maledictus_faust> they have apps for that
[4:11:18] <gamma_wavve> you know you can just use shazam right
[4:11:26] <+Nefarious_Bear> this was probably before shazam
[4:11:32] <+Shaggnar> I'm assuming this is before Shazam was a thing?
[4:11:34] <Samex_Comex> Damn nice work
[4:11:34] <gamma_wavve> oh maybe
[4:11:41] <awalr> 2 live crew always comes to the rescue
[4:11:49] <weightedguccigi> omg 2live crew
[4:11:53] <+dickbuttwoman> Also, this isn't just some random people. These are session musicians. As a former session musician, we don't get credited often for our work, but it's a proud profession.
[4:11:56] <gamma_wavve> nope
[4:11:58] <finaltrinity5> nah
[4:12:02] <finaltrinity5> still free
[4:12:13] <+Shaggnar> It's free, they link you to places you can but music
[4:12:17] <+Nefarious_Bear> There's nothing more satisfying than finding a song you listened to 10 years ago and you only know like 1 line from it
[4:12:22] <PsychedelicRev> @dickbuttwoman That's very interesting
[4:12:32] <kell_twit> !uptime
[4:12:32] <@Nightbot> 4 hours 12 minutes 42 seconds
[4:12:33] <Raconteur999> you have been building a huge bill for Shazam and didn't know it
[4:12:40] <SkullyIsDie> Plauge has great taste
[4:12:53] <weightedguccigi> great wind down after work
[4:12:58] <$Cardboard96> brandy "you're a fine" girl was used in guardians i know that feel, it made it hard to talk about southerns nights
[4:13:13] <+modmanawesome69> god we've been here for more than 4 hours
[4:13:16] <+modmanawesome69> christ
[4:13:18] <OrangeGameCinema> That hair is majestic Kreygasm
[4:13:24] <finaltrinity5> ego the living planet
[4:13:25] <sosuke5> Ego
[4:13:48] <cherubsanonymous> GOTG2 is best MCU film, fight me
[4:14:03] <+dickbuttwoman> Sonic comics are the only good comics
[4:14:03] <+modmanawesome69> GOTG2 isnt even the best GOTG movie
[4:14:08] <finaltrinity5> marvel cinematic universe ain't perfect but it is VERY successful
[4:14:13] <FauxGateau> yeah serenity is
[4:14:14] <+Nefarious_Bear> watching plague draw makes me want to develop an actual skill in life that isnt playing videogames well
[4:14:36] <PsychedelicRev> Paige, thank you!
[4:14:38] <cherubsanonymous> Yeah, it's not like they had 20 movies to do that
[4:14:45] <%Cogito1001> Make him and Deadpool go on Jerry Springer.
[4:14:46] <Shadow_Jager> Too bad there will be no more GOTG movies.
[4:14:46] <finaltrinity5> who would you cast as death?
[4:14:50] <sosuke5> It would be hard to incorporate
[4:14:58] <Raconteur999> They coulda used Hela!
[4:15:14] <T_Sasquatch> I'd prefer if thanos didn't kill half of the universe just to get his dick wet
[4:15:17] <jeecay> He'd have no sympathy if he was looking to commit genocide to get laid
[4:15:17] <+dickbuttwoman> Death ain't abstract in marvel
[4:15:19] <Ether101_Prime> They didn't have the movie rights to Death.
[4:15:20] <cherubsanonymous> It wouldn't have appealed to a mainstream audience, even it was more coherent than what they went with
[4:15:20] <ghettomacgyver> Night guys, just wanted to stop in and see what lewd things were going on but its late AF, ya'll have fun :D
[4:15:20] <Raconteur999> literal GODDESS of DEATH
[4:15:24] <%maledictus_faust> halving pregnancy rates
[4:15:27] <+Nefarious_Bear> Thanos didn't live up to "The Mad Titan" in Infinity War
[4:15:29] <bursky00> The gauntlet or the collective stones can't do that though.
[4:15:31] <FauxGateau> night dude
[4:15:34] <OrangeGameCinema> anita sarkeesian
[4:15:36] <+Nefarious_Bear> Thanos isnt supposed to be a sympathetic character
[4:15:36] <Futurecity10> Hollywood pick would be anjelina joelee
[4:15:37] <+DERGONS86> Thats e
[4:15:44] <person181> whoever played malifacent
[4:15:48] <PsychedelicRev> A Skeleton would be a good pick
[4:16:00] <weightedguccigi> damn LUL
[4:16:02] <%maledictus_faust> a rather small cat
[4:16:13] <cherubsanonymous> We should probably stop seeing actors as people
[4:16:15] <+dickbuttwoman> Alan Cummings in drag
[4:16:18] <+Maids4lyfe> whoever plays Deadpool's dead girlfriend
[4:16:21] <jeecay> seeing as how she's a skeleton you just need a good voice actress
[4:16:25] <+Nefarious_Bear> Jim Carey in drag
[4:16:48] <person181> NO make her like jessaca rabbit and make her animated
[4:16:53] <Firemane1279> the same Voice type as Liara T'soni could be good?
[4:16:55] <$Cardboard96> mm blood milk
[4:16:59] <Shadow_Jager> Yeah Jim Carrey in drag lol
[4:17:05] <jeecay> Blood milk. better than cows milk
[4:17:16] <+Nefarious_Bear> does blood have nipples
[4:17:16] <Ether101_Prime> I think they should have kept Star Lord's dad being J'son but Jams Gunn was to worried that people would realize he was just a young Han Solo.
[4:17:19] <Coystick> Maaaaan I haven't listened to Rob Zombie in a while
[4:17:21] <Samex_Comex> Rock on Zombie man
[4:17:26] <Gentlemanjake_> I love it
[4:17:27] <+Maids4lyfe> so do you guys put your cereal before or after the blood milk? teaBuns
[4:17:31] <IntrepidEye> Sounds ok
[4:17:34] <PsychedelicRev> @PeachSaliva Maybe Milla Jovovich?
[4:17:43] <gamma_wavve> its great
[4:17:46] <SkullyIsDie> Sounds like a good song in a genre I hate
[4:17:53] <%Cogito1001> no
[4:17:58] <$Cardboard96> my phone died now i must hink
[4:17:59] <Devildavacado> Tilda Swinton?
[4:18:01] <$Cardboard96> *think
[4:18:18] <finaltrinity5> kat dennings as lady death lmao
[4:18:22] <jiin6> in everything?
[4:18:24] <+Maids4lyfe> Morena Baccarin
[4:18:32] <finaltrinity5> Charlize theron?
[4:18:33] <Raconteur999> she's already Jane porter's friend
[4:18:35] <+dickbuttwoman> Divine, the main character of Pink Flamingos?
[4:18:57] <jeecay> Kat Dennings needs to play livewire in man of steel 2..if such a thing could exist
[4:18:58] <PsychedelicRev> I think she has a decent range and can play the sultry. I would say Keria Knightly as well, but don't think she would fit
[4:19:05] <+Nefarious_Bear> Amy Schumer as Lady Death, she's already killing comedy
[4:19:06] <finaltrinity5> I would have definitely chosen Cate blanchett if she wasnt already Hela
[4:19:09] <person181> unless you're a man, you can be anything
[4:19:13] <jiin6> Keira knightly is crazy tho
[4:19:15] <+The4winds> I show up late hoping that maybe pitou was being drawn. Hopes=dashed
[4:19:15] <+Ell1ot> james earl jones! what are we talking about?
[4:19:39] <PsychedelicRev> @jiin6 Yes, but just talking about the role of Lady Death
[4:19:45] <+Nefarious_Bear> a good lady death pick for the MCU
[4:19:57] <piggypig> muh menopause
[4:19:57] <+Nefarious_Bear> I wouldnt mind james earl jones LUL
[4:19:57] <Firemane1279> @ell1ot What actress would be good for lady death. I's say the same voice type as Liara T'soni
[4:20:07] <Devildavacado> The film industry is pretty fucked for anyone who isn't a white male.
[4:20:17] <jeecay> takahata 101 for lady death
[4:20:17] <sosuke5> Unless you are Judy Dench, but still you're limited
[4:20:22] <%maledictus_faust> beefy cat girl action superhero
[4:20:26] <+VanaSkiller> YEE no1WOW
[4:20:31] <LixFury> Need more beef cake girls
[4:20:33] <+dickbuttwoman> Harris Milstead
[4:20:36] <IntrepidEye> I'm kind of a fan of Helen Mirren after RED
[4:20:36] <jiin6> Buff Judy Dench
[4:20:40] <vonmaultke> no1WOW
[4:20:48] <finaltrinity5> buff judy dench for SURE
[4:20:51] <Samex_Comex> They should make a Golden Girls cinematic universe
[4:20:52] <person181> could she crush a watermelon with her thighs plauge?
[4:20:52] <Huntercd> There are plenty of hot older women in Hollywood
[4:20:57] <+VanaSkiller> anuYareYare
[4:21:06] <cherubsanonymous> I mean, she did beef up for the role
[4:21:07] <finaltrinity5> its gal gadot
[4:21:10] <+Ell1ot> wasn't she pregnant for part of the movie?
[4:21:11] <jiin6> that young han solo was too pretty
[4:21:11] <jeecay> Do you even lift Diana?
[4:21:12] <$Cardboard96> cast an ogre
[4:21:14] <+The4winds> Either they can act or they can fit the look
[4:21:29] <awalr> vvymyn
[4:21:39] <jeecay> I was so empowered I cried
[4:21:42] <%Cogito1001> POWERFULLSHIT

[4:22:26] <EmeraldSage> #thighssavelives
[4:22:30] <austonamous> jiggle sparks emotion, yes.
[4:22:43] <finaltrinity5> wonder woman was/is the best dcu movie, right?
[4:22:45] <Firemane1279> wonder woman thighs. gennaDoge gennaDoge gennaDoge
[4:23:05] <%maledictus_faust> honestly Male or female, you're not overpowering an alien
[4:23:14] <Paralurx> I remember seeing Sarah Conner doing pullups and shit in T2 and thinking she was super fucking rad
[4:23:16] <@BitterBits> Why bird girl Eli
[4:23:31] <Ayru_> democracy
[4:23:34] <$Cardboard96> cast idubbz jumping off counter.mp4
[4:23:35] <Ether101_Prime> If that was the reason then why didn't everyone love the Underworld movies?
[4:23:37] <Raconteur999> or you're JK Rowling and you just say shit ten years later
[4:23:38] <PsychedelicRev> @PlagueOfGripes I think this trend of female leads in film and games got started and will probably will continue for awhile, how did Woolie put it, "The Times"
[4:23:39] <T_Sasquatch> that's why black widow sucks. "bad ass"
[4:23:41] <Karwakamu> Ripley was written as a man and then just cast as a woman
[4:23:51] <jeecay> @Paralurx best part was cocking the shotgun onehanded
[4:23:51] <Samex_Comex> It's Nic!
[4:23:59] <+dickbuttwoman> There's things out there for them already, but it's definitely not mainstream
[4:24:08] <$Cardboard96> "Empowered because a woman's thighs jiggled." vinejoelLUL
[4:24:12] <+Ell1ot> Best actor: Thigh Jiggle
[4:24:14] <@BitterBits> @Samex_Comex don't blow it, you know he ain't paying attention
[4:24:16] <juicysal> The Rippling of those thighs is destroying the Patriarchy, Paige!
[4:24:39] <Samex_Comex> Oops
[4:24:39] <NME_Dom> NIC
[4:24:46] <jiin6> hey nic
[4:24:49] <%Cogito1001> JK needs to be banned from retconning things
[4:24:50] <LixFury> how about you write a good character instead of writing a gay black character?
[4:24:58] <theamazingroberto> jach nicholson's line from as good as it gets (when asked how he writes women so well) "first i write a man. then i take away reason, and accountability"
[4:25:16] <jiin6> all the sexuals
[4:25:22] <+The4winds> @LixFury So a gay black character is inherently bad?
[4:25:24] <Devildavacado> White, straight, male is the default for most protagonists. If your protag varies in any way, and is in a flop, it will be used to justify not casting the same kind of character in future films.
[4:25:29] <@BitterBits> hola
[4:25:41] <Huntercd> @BitterBits bitterAyy
[4:25:42] <@BitterBits> don't do that

[4:27:06] <LixFury> @The4winds no im saying a character that is written to be a good character and made a minority later will be better then a character created to be a minority

[4:28:18] <MrHappyFunshine> Running on empty food reviews?
[4:28:23] <piggypig> eggs are just bird periods
[4:28:25] <jiin6> its such a great edit
[4:28:40] <Raconteur999> @PlagueOfGripes do you plan to color this or is it line art?
[4:28:42] <piggypig> so youd be eating her period
[4:28:51] <LixFury> oh god the IBS is real in this edit LUL
[4:28:58] <vonmaultke> tasty period
[4:29:24] <Them00n> Well there's no uterine lining in an egg. So that's good.
[4:29:27] <finaltrinity5> wait can someone whisper this to me lol I missed it
[4:29:44] <@dcn2049> The laugh at the end is what does it
[4:30:03] <@BitterBits> @finaltrinity5 https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v_y7n20ryX0
[4:30:17] <+The4winds> @LixFury I can agree with that, but I guess I always thought that's how you should write anyway.
[4:30:20] <Huntercd> bird menstruation
[4:30:21] <finaltrinity5> ty ty
[4:30:33] <Coystick> Constantly
[4:30:36] <%applesonthemoon> yeah breakfast is just bird periods
[4:30:37] <%Cogito1001> Buy an autoblow 5000 paige
[4:30:38] <Them00n> Apparently humans are the only species that has periods.
[4:30:40] <Devildavacado> I'm not sure human standards can be applied to other species.
[4:30:46] <Them00n> Sucks to be you Paige.
[4:30:51] <+Ell1ot> Paige lays giant eggs? is that where the pee is stored?
[4:30:52] <Coystick> your pat sized egg
[4:31:00] <$Cardboard96> vinejoelLUL
[4:31:04] <jiin6> Giant egg laying, new paige lore
[4:31:13] <+Shaggnar> They make one a day
[4:31:15] <Samex_Comex> Magic?
[4:31:24] <jiin6> its probably magic
[4:31:24] <+Maids4lyfe> it's just bird periods
[4:31:25] <austonamous> empty void?
[4:31:28] <LixFury> @The4winds you'd think but the hollywood machine thinks in focus groups and mass appeal, not in artistic integrity or quality.
[4:31:30] <%Cogito1001> Its work of the devil
[4:31:39] <Them00n> Do they form an entire egg in a day?
[4:31:50] <piggypig> yes
[4:31:59] <Huntercd> No belly buttons
[4:32:03] <Raconteur999> sometimes an egg shell forms around an entire egg
[4:32:05] <piggypig> as someone who's dad is a chicken farmer i know lots about chicken and their eg production
[4:32:12] <+Bro_Dzee> Fry it up, or would that be cannibalism
[4:32:12] <Samex_Comex> Take eggs out to curve
[4:32:16] <platypusgiraffe> they'd be tasty
[4:32:16] <Devildavacado> Is scrambling a human egg considered cannibalism?
[4:32:18] <%Cogito1001> Thats a pretty good yoke
[4:32:19] <Explodincatz> wow
[4:32:27] <+The4winds> @LixFury That's how it's always been though. Look at any popular film trend in the last 50 years.
[4:32:28] <jiin6> wow indeed
[4:32:31] <+InhumanMilitia> eggs are soft when in the chicken like when you soak an egg in vinegar they get a shell when they need to lay i think
[4:32:37] <Ether101_Prime> I wonder if they'd like the lady fight in My Lucky Star?
[4:32:39] <jiin6> they do...

[4:32:50] <cherubsanonymous> Thank goodness
[4:32:52] <eloquentB> wtf conversation did i walk in on
[4:32:58] <+Ell1ot> can we go back to talking about the weird things animals do instead of the weird things people do?
[4:32:59] <+RandomDefault> Tuned in to "Some women eat their own placenta"
[4:33:00] <Makaru225> Plague has that good taste
[4:33:15] <%Cogito1001> Fry em on the griddle
[4:33:15] <$Cardboard96> vinejoelMmm
[4:33:16] <+Maids4lyfe> did you know that human semen can be used as a 1 to 1 substitute for egg whites
[4:33:24] <@dcn2049> What if you asked them to?
[4:33:34] <Explodincatz> teal

[4:35:33] <@BitterBits> Yeah Ashen is a slow start but picks up
[4:35:36] <Raconteur999> @PlagueOfGripes will this be a line art? I'm looking for a new coloring project
[4:35:41] <%Cogito1001> speaking of souls clones did that anime one ever come out? COde Vein?
[4:35:41] <@BitterBits> controls are tight and it's fairly fun to bonk things
[4:35:45] <Futurecity10> @PeachSaliva Did you see a page from the sonic movie was leaked? https://i.redd.it/wk8p62nlhr321.jpg
[4:35:48] <+Manjove> finally finished ending E of Nier Automata

[4:35:51] <+The4winds> when's pitou
[4:35:51] <@BitterBits> and honestly that's about 300% more than most souls clones have been able to pull off
[4:35:56] <QuixDragonII> Ashen?
[4:36:06] <Futurecity10> Ashen or Code Vein?
[4:36:06] <luckevalentine> below

[4:36:27] <@BitterBits> Yeah Ashen is a solid game though
[4:36:32] <+Maids4lyfe> I still don't understand how the Zora evolved into the Rito
[4:36:34] <@BitterBits> I think it's been worth the $40
[4:36:39] <sosuke5> The Hunter x hunter antagonist
[4:36:42] <Zaphire_Saucypants> yes
[4:36:52] <PsychedelicRev> Would it be better if it were to be called Above?
[4:36:53] <%Cogito1001> Thats fine
[4:36:54] <Raconteur999> you talking that Game Grumps Balogna Man?

[4:37:31] <%Cogito1001> Godsmack is like that also
[4:37:35] <+Manjove> i like Disturbed
[4:37:36] <approachingdeath> I love you for hating pearl jam
[4:37:36] <+Maids4lyfe> Pearl Jam, Creed
[4:37:52] <cherubsanonymous> McCartney era is the only good era
[4:37:53] <SkullyIsDie> Im not a beatles fan either
[4:37:53] <+InhumanMilitia> same plague
[4:37:59] <jiin6> you're not the only one
[4:38:03] <approachingdeath> Oh no, I like the Beetles
[4:38:05] <+Maids4lyfe> I never really cared for The Beatles
[4:38:08] <Futurecity10> I'm with plague, I dont like the beatles
[4:38:12] <+InhumanMilitia> No its not paige
[4:38:13] <austonamous> I respect them but it's not my cup of tea
[4:38:18] <+Maids4lyfe> not hate them, just I don't listen to them
[4:38:19] <approachingdeath> Hey Jude though
[4:38:20] <austonamous> TPFufun
[4:38:22] <QuixDragonII> they say you're either a Beatles man or an Elvis man
[4:38:25] <+Hilleltaco> I can't stand listening to The Beatles, but not because I think they're bad, my parents just played them way too much
[4:38:32] <+The4winds> They're fine, I never listen to them in any playlists, but I won't get mad if they start playing
[4:38:35] <%Cogito1001> The Wiggles > The Beatles FITE ME
[4:38:40] <+Bro_Dzee> You can't be expected to like everything
[4:39:18] <T_Sasquatch> popular things tend to be eh too
[4:39:21] <+Maids4lyfe> I feel like my taste in music is stilted
[4:39:29] <Them00n> My guitar gently weeps?
[4:39:30] <+Ell1ot> I want to eat some ham
[4:39:31] <+The4winds> Only pearl jam song I like is Even Flow just like everyone else
[4:39:31] <Samex_Comex> I Am the Walrus?
[4:39:45] <Devildavacado> The Beatles is probably too cheerful for Plague.
[4:39:52] <+Maids4lyfe> lol
[4:39:57] <@BitterBits> @PlagueOfGripes Gonna go get upset at smash. Enjoy the draw man.
[4:40:13] <piggypig> @PlagueOfGripes you ever listened to any songs by WEEN?
[4:40:14] <%Cogito1001> see ya
[4:40:31] <vladtet909> What about Maxwell's Silver Hammer
[4:40:37] <+modmanawesome69> JUMP
[4:40:38] <approachingdeath> Starting to sound like an Elliott Smith guy, plague
[4:40:39] <Paralurx> YOU GOT THE TOUCH
[4:40:45] <+TinoPepino24> how about the smiths?
[4:40:56] <Paralurx> This song is the fucking shit, I love it so hype
[4:41:10] <Samex_Comex> Kick his butt Optimus prime!
[4:41:17] <jeecay> If you got the touch every time someone made the right decision we'd have world peace.
[4:41:18] <Explodincatz> what is spirit mode?
[4:41:20] <Them00n> Tom Waits is the shit.
[4:41:22] <Futurecity10> I 100%ed The world of light. Its a massive joke
[4:41:25] <+Hilleltaco> I love Tom Waits
[4:41:26] <Ether101_Prime> I was playing World of Light like by default.
[4:41:28] <Them00n> Play some Rain Dogs.
[4:41:34] <jeecay> "One shall stand. One shall fall"
[4:41:40] <Coystick> Gimme that Mule Variations
[4:41:44] <Raconteur999> Yes, I know about Transformers, but who here thinks about this song in AMV Hell?
[4:42:14] <Them00n> Bottom of the World is probably my favorite.
[4:42:29] <gamma_wavve> my favorite is come on up to the house
[4:42:31] <jeecay> @Raconteur999 I think about mark walberg butchering in boogie nights
[4:42:50] <Raconteur999> Say hi to ya mother for me
[4:42:59] <austonamous> favorite song to personally sing plague?
[4:43:01] <QuixDragonII> William S. Burroughs.. ewww
[4:43:06] <+modmanawesome69> my band like that is Pink Floyd. not particularly a fan
[4:43:10] <+Shaggnar> The crazy drug guy
[4:43:12] <Devildavacado> Some people just aren't going to like some music. It's people who get upset over someone elses music taste that confuses me.
[4:43:14] <$Cardboard96> I like hell broke luce or whatever from tom
[4:43:21] <%Cogito1001> You guys like David Byrne?
[4:43:24] <jeecay> HE WILLIAM TELLED HER?
[4:43:30] <QuixDragonII> Nope, they made a movie about it called Naked Lunch
[4:43:33] <jiin6> Foreshadowing
[4:43:34] <QuixDragonII> disturbing af
[4:43:43] <Coystick> Filipino Box Spring Hooooog
[4:44:27] <jeecay> Never trust the devil. even if you are the devil don't trust him
[4:44:35] <Paralurx> "This bullet will do a thing when you fire it, and when he fired it the bullet did the thing"
[4:45:14] <awalr> "or whatever"
[4:45:14] <+Hilleltaco> There's still a lot of Tom Waits stuff I haven't heard yet, but I think about Hell Broke Luce a lot
[4:45:15] <jeecay> Ok Chat favorite deal with the devil story
[4:45:27] <jeecay> I like Bearskin
[4:45:29] <+Ell1ot> what if the bullet killed his mistress instead of his wife? that's an awkward conversation he's going to have with his wife later
[4:45:45] <platypusgiraffe> the devil went down to georgia
[4:45:45] <$Cardboard96> Robert Johnson is the name
[4:45:51] <Raconteur999> The Keanu Reeves Constantine movie has flaws, but I sill love the last ten minutes
[4:45:54] <%Cogito1001> his instrument was his stand
[4:45:55] <QuixDragonII> Bob Dylan larped making a deal with Satan in an interview once.
[4:45:57] <Devildavacado> What deal would you make with Satan?
[4:45:58] <Huntercd> Dethklok
[4:46:04] <awalr> what if satan could give you buff catgirls
[4:46:04] <Devildavacado> Theoretically.
[4:46:30] <gamma_wavve> he could probably get the best lawyers too
[4:46:33] <jeecay> Your lawyer prolly works for satan he's got his own firm
[4:46:34] <+Ell1ot> he's the devil, not a genie
[4:46:37] <austonamous> lawyers dont do that already?
[4:47:11] <+NeonTurnip> but that's with knowledge of what the monkeys paw does
[4:47:24] <jeecay> I guess the question here is Is it wrong to torment a sadist?
[4:47:25] <approachingdeath> Devil using monkey paw rules
[4:47:28] <Devildavacado> The Monkeys Paw is trying to teach you that there's no changing fate.
[4:47:30] <+Maids4lyfe> LUL
[4:47:34] <Nineless> Just throw the monkey's paw into a shredder.
[4:47:38] <vladtet909> The only opera I like is Der Freischütz and that also involves the Devil.
[4:47:41] <Devildavacado> It's a story about hubris.
[4:47:42] <vonmaultke> But plague pays the price
[4:47:43] <Nineless> Don't even try to beat it at its own game. Turn it into glue.
[4:47:44] <Shadow_Jager> Simple you which that nothing bad can happen to you or your loved ones
[4:47:49] <jeecay> ask the devil to make a wish on the monkey's paw
[4:47:50] <+Ell1ot> i wish the monkey paw would grow the rest of his body back
[4:47:53] <+zer0crow> "I wish you can't grant any wishes, ever again."
[4:47:57] <gamma_wavve> damn plague
[4:48:00] <Them00n> What if the monkey's paw fucks you over anyway?
[4:48:06] <jiin6> monkey pa's
[4:48:10] <Raconteur999> What if you don't eat the last bite of doughnut?
[4:48:13] <cherubsanonymous> "Hii, I'm Paul!"
[4:48:15] <+TinoPepino24> más sabe el diablo por viejo que por diablo
[4:48:18] <%Cogito1001> Yeehaw
[4:48:38] <finaltrinity5> I thought you called your grandma meemaw

[4:48:46] <Samex_Comex> Nana and Papa
[4:48:47] <$Cardboard96> Granny is fine too
[4:48:49] <%Cogito1001> pep pep
[4:48:51] <QuixDragonII> A lot of southerners call their grandmother mema
[4:48:55] <sosuke5> Nan and Pop
[4:49:04] <+modmanawesome69> Papa and Nonnie
[4:49:10] <jiin6> mom and old man
[4:49:23] <$Cardboard96> gaga pepap
[4:49:28] <QuixDragonII> we called my grand dad bigdaddy, in hindsight it sounded like a pimp
[4:49:28] <piggypig> i called my grandmother by her name, but i didnt know that was her name i thought that was how you said grandma in spanish
[4:49:30] <finaltrinity5> calling someone by their last name what a fucking weeb
[4:49:40] <+Ell1ot> wish for the monkey paw to turn back into a whole monkey so you can kill it and have multiple monkey paws
[4:49:43] <+Bro_Dzee> Nana and Poppa Bob
[4:49:43] <%Cogito1001> Dad and Susan
[4:49:55] <Risingxiv> granny sexbang
[4:49:55] <vonmaultke> I call my grandparents Nana and dead
[4:50:12] <jeecay> Dan learned to talk super early and just mimiced his parents. so he called his grandparents mom and dad and his parents by name
[4:50:15] <Devildavacado> My dad insists on his grand kids calling him by his nick name.
[4:50:16] <cherubsanonymous> My family calls our grandmother Mena
[4:50:23] <+Shaggnar> It's considered being too personal for them
[4:50:31] <jiin6> my grandma was nan and grandpa Pap...haha yep
[4:50:35] <OrangeGameCinema> Actually, Dan heard his mom call her mom 'mom' so Dan started calling her, his grandma, mom.
[4:50:59] <jeecay> MMMMMMMM. I"m sorry paige but I still feel like I'm better than you
[4:51:05] <person181> japan is weird

[4:51:45] <%Cogito1001> XENOPHOBIA BABY
[4:51:58] <vonmaultke> The Gaijin bubble?
[4:52:00] <Paralurx> Naka, like Nakama
[4:52:07] <Raconteur999> they're pretty cruel to Japan-born Koreans, too
[4:52:31] <approachingdeath> Xenophobia and maybe a dash of sexism
[4:52:33] <Paralurx> Racism can be cultural
[4:52:36] <Nineless> Cultural racism is racism.
[4:52:40] <@dcn2049> It's racism.
[4:52:47] <jiin6> japanese are kinda big on racism
[4:52:54] <jeecay> Our racism is diffrent :P
[4:52:55] <Firemane1279> Paige, it's still racism.
[4:52:57] <approachingdeath> that sweet sweet cultural racism
[4:52:58] <not_crabby> woo racism
[4:52:58] <Nineless> It's a very pervasive thing in asia in general.
[4:53:00] <$Cardboard96> sounds totally tubular dude
[4:53:05] <%Cogito1001> Culture aint always good.
[4:53:06] <+Ell1ot> does this bird girl have two mouths? does her beak open so she can eat things?
[4:53:07] <@dcn2049> making it cultural doesn't make it right
[4:53:14] <piggypig> living in isolation will do that to you
[4:53:15] <+Manjove> tolerance of intolerance isnt a terrible idea
[4:53:16] <Firemane1279> maybe xenophobic, but that's a strech.
[4:53:17] <approachingdeath> Tubular racism
[4:53:19] <jiin6> They are the Nails, not hammered down
[4:53:25] <PsychedelicRev> Their super long history of fighting against Korea
[4:53:30] <jeecay> Gundam has space racism
[4:53:32] <not_crabby> being racism is fine if its ingrained at birth
[4:53:34] <cherubsanonymous> They don't really hate people specifically for their race and moreso they're like "Who the fuck are you get out of our country"
[4:53:37] <vonmaultke> They might wear white pointy hats Kappa
[4:53:38] <not_crabby> Kappa
[4:53:38] <%Cogito1001> BAD PAIGE
[4:53:40] <piggypig> dont engage dacon
[4:53:49] <@dcn2049> Shush pig
[4:53:56] <sosuke5> So...hate the japanese then...
[4:53:57] <piggypig> hush dacon uwu
[4:54:01] <platypusgiraffe> Paige you're always wrong just like pat
[4:54:02] <$Cardboard96> don't tell me what to do pig
[4:54:05] <jiin6> the internet is a place where logic dies, you can't argue with it
[4:54:18] <piggypig> remember guys, christmas carols at 5pm today
[4:54:26] <reonome> baka gaijin

[4:54:40] <$Cardboard96> Gaijin sounds like such a mean word
[4:54:41] <cherubsanonymous> I LOVE BEING OSTRACIZED
[4:54:55] <Kratok> They worked really hard institutionalizing you into their institutional prejudice
[4:55:15] <jeecay> I'm not accepted anywhere anyway to meh
[4:55:32] <piggypig> pigs arent accepted anywhere 😢
[4:55:39] <Huntercd> Yea it's kinda like that
[4:55:45] <PsychedelicRev> I'll be working there, soon, for a year up in Hokkaido, I wouldn't expect being fully accepted as a foreigner
[4:55:51] <person181> sleep is calling my name, night all
[4:55:51] <Raconteur999> hell, there's a subset of Japanese that used to be the laboring class and they call them "four-legs" or something
[4:55:59] <$Cardboard96> They're just calling you foriegn guy ?
[4:55:59] <Nineless> "Greetings, I too am a human being, yes I am. Smile."
[4:56:18] <jeecay> Gaijin-sama
[4:56:22] <Devildavacado> Is insulting your friends not a thing in Japan?

[4:56:52] <piggypig> ELI-DESU~
[4:56:53] <finaltrinity5> you saying Japan ain't got the bantz
[4:57:01] <vonmaultke> So it’s like pakeha here? It’s a slur against white people but it’s used as a political term of race now
[4:57:08] <+VanaSkiller> Paigey DESU~ no1WOW
[4:57:10] <Paralurx> If you can't tell your friends that they're pieces of shit are you even really their friend?
[4:57:16] <Samex_Comex> Do they still shove their fingers into butts?
[4:57:19] <%Cogito1001> Japan is extremely fast pace and has little chill
[4:57:25] <Huntercd> Japan is fun to visit but not to stay
[4:57:30] <PsychedelicRev> @PeachSaliva Sorry Paige, I missed it if you said it, what part of Japan were you in?
[4:57:33] <Kratok> That's the same for us, in a less structured way. You'd probably never introduce yourself as Miss Boivin even if it was the expected way to be spoken to in a... party or something
[4:57:43] <cherubsanonymous> Desu desu, cunt
[4:57:54] <Coystick> yesh we aussies love animeland

[4:58:41] <Coystick> "G'day cunts. where's Akihabra"?
[4:58:49] <jeecay> I heard someone tell me Kyoto is the place to visit. that same person said tokyo was busy and miserable
[4:58:58] <+Manjove> is plague making a fetish bird?
[4:59:02] <Devildavacado> "Oh yeah? Come over here and say that."
[4:59:02] <Ether101_Prime> What's up with foreign lover intersts in anime?
[4:59:13] <jeecay> A friend of mine went to osaka and loved it
[4:59:15] <+Manjove> because mysterious
[4:59:19] <approachingdeath> “That’s my purse, gaijin!” (Commence groin kicking)
[4:59:22] <OrangeGameCinema> @Manjove What's a "fetish bird?"
[4:59:23] <cherubsanonymous> It's purrty good
[4:59:27] <jiin6> Osaka is the south of japan
[4:59:29] <gamma_wavve> night yall
[4:59:30] <+VanaSkiller> LUL
[4:59:30] <Nineless> That's the only reason anyone outside japan knows about Osaka being Osaka.

[4:59:50] <Stay_Hydrated_Bot> @plagueofgripes stayhyBottle You've been live for just over 5 hours. By this point in your broadcast you should have consumed at least 20oz (600mL) of water to maintain optimum hydration.
[5:00:02] <PsychedelicRev> I imagine Osaka and Kyushu (mainly Kyushu) would be like Hokkaido. Paige, ever visit, or get know, what it's like there
[5:00:14] <Ayru_> rabbit island

[5:02:54] <+Hilleltaco> Oh I think I read that blog
[5:03:07] <piggypig> imagine a bunch of japanese people trying to tug your penis all the time
[5:03:09] <shalashasknya> American military incidents didn't help with those perceptions.
[5:03:10] <Explodincatz> thats cause Woolie looks like an anime
[5:03:11] <Raconteur999> all the kids doing Kancho
[5:03:11] <jeecay> They probably thought he was a celebrity
[5:03:14] <awalr> japan thinks every big black guy is Bob Sapp
[5:03:19] <Coystick> Because to them Woolie is a Kaiju
[5:03:21] <jiin6> Woolie was a living anime
[5:03:29] <Paralurx> wear a cup
[5:03:32] <$Cardboard96> A black man? I heard of those !
[5:03:33] <suikudo> I wonder if it was nice or if he felt like an exotic animal
[5:03:55] <+Ell1ot> I forgot that Woolie went to Japan because he didn't have a high budget puppet show and implied nudity.
[5:04:04] <reonome> thats because he's a big weeb
[5:04:06] <Samex_Comex> Oh shit it's Blanka
[5:04:06] <+Maids4lyfe> lol
[5:04:07] <%Cogito1001> Ohio is gross
[5:04:07] <+Shaggnar> From what I've heard people in rural japan are actually more accepting of foreigners. They just treat you like people and will never bring up that your foreign
[5:04:12] <PsychedelicRev> @PeachSaliva I'm really enjoying this information, I leave to work there in a few months, it's great to learn about what it's like living and working there. Thank you!
[5:04:18] <jeecay> Ohio gozaimasu
[5:04:21] <jiin6> woolie visited, never lived
[5:04:24] <suikudo> Thats good to hear! ive been holding off because i wasnt sure how the reception would be
[5:04:25] <%Cogito1001> Indiana is worse
[5:04:27] <$Cardboard96> I know someone who left ohio for germany
[5:04:27] <@dcn2049> Ohio is a shit hole, yes
[5:04:31] <approachingdeath> woolie was probably busy marking out over weeb shit
[5:04:34] <piggypig> lol dacon
[5:04:36] <Coystick> OOOOOOOOOH
[5:04:39] <+modmanawesome69> I had friends that went to Japan a year or so ago, they said they loved Hokkaido
[5:04:45] <+Maids4lyfe> Ohio: Grandpa's Cheese Barn, HELL IS REAL, and endless empty space
[5:04:46] <%Cogito1001> Indiana is the Florida of the north

[5:04:59] <mutelava> Heya :(
[5:05:05] <Huntercd> I was stationed in Japan I had fun.
[5:05:18] <Samex_Comex> Is that the Potato state?
[5:05:19] <InfinityCircuit> Indiana, the state that fought for the Union and regretted it
[5:05:20] <+Maids4lyfe> it's almost like everyone in Utah is in a cult or something
[5:05:23] <approachingdeath> ohio seems more south than some of the south
[5:05:24] <GGRollo> "I don't experience depression" God I wish that was me.
[5:05:37] <Huntercd> The bars are fun
[5:05:39] <jeecay> @GGRollo I know that feel

[5:05:53] <PsychedelicRev> @PeachSaliva Wow. Very valuable information. Thank you so much!
[5:05:57] <Kratok> I feel like I'd love to be a stand out foreigner in a bar
[5:05:58] <jeecay> Japanglish
[5:06:00] <$Cardboard96> I heard blue collar japanese people can really drink
[5:06:01] <Devildavacado> How hard do you think it would be to bar tend your way around Japan?
[5:06:04] <PsychedelicRev> I really appreciate it
[5:06:16] <Paralurx> Gomenesorry
[5:06:19] <jeecay> some people have a gift for language. My sister is like that.
[5:06:28] <suikudo> I also thank you its a relief to know all that
[5:06:48] <suikudo> I have actually been postponing the trip because of this
[5:06:50] <GGRollo> @jeecay <3
[5:06:50] <+TinoPepino24> how about if your a Latino in Japan?
[5:07:08] <juicysal> Did you sit in his lap?
[5:07:11] <%maledictus_faust> I used to find the idea of knowing another language interesting until I became a linguist and found out people are stupid in every language. =/
[5:07:14] <Coystick> Herbivore men
[5:07:16] <Paralurx> Paige did you hug everybody?
[5:07:19] <+modmanawesome69> I had friends that went to Japan a year or so ago, they said they loved Hokkaido. One was a very mexican man. he said he loved it @TinoPepino24

[5:08:10] <%Cogito1001> Ive seen the footage
[5:08:12] <piggypig> @dcn2049 hey cutie~
[5:08:16] <T_Sasquatch> how do people like that get overpopulated?
[5:08:20] <Coystick> Abe gotta save the race with big tiddy anime
[5:08:21] <jeecay> cucking an entire country. such evil is deep and profound
[5:08:25] <Paralurx> Go out, get fucked up
[5:08:35] <Raconteur999> ahh, never mind, it looks like the blog is gone
[5:08:48] <%Cogito1001> Japan isn overpopulated, theyre ona decline
[5:08:49] <Raconteur999> but the TV Tropes is good
[5:08:51] <$Cardboard96> @piggypig vinejoelBBQ
[5:08:54] <Coystick> When in Rome is the term you're looking for
[5:09:09] <+Maids4lyfe> Japan is just very tightly packed
[5:09:33] <%Cogito1001> Bodypillows are stealing all the men
[5:09:36] <GGRollo> Kana is stupid easy to learn using mnemonics too. I got those down in less than a week or so.
[5:09:39] <Paralurx> Japanese have invested so much in Give-Up Technology that they forgot to breed at all and their population is decreasing at a concerning rate
[5:09:51] <Huntercd> I just got a phrase book when I went
[5:10:02] <PsychedelicRev> @PeachSaliva I've learned some hiragana. Some of the ways of speaking is very helpful indeed. Again, thanks again Paige
[5:10:03] <cherubsanonymous> Why
[5:10:05] <piggypig> japanese women are probably really thirsty for breeding
[5:10:13] <+Ell1ot> i get confused when people tell me that they read audio books
[5:10:14] <rakshum> Much like pandas, japanese need help in breeding!
[5:10:17] <+Manjove> should listen to Thrawn or Tarkin
[5:10:24] <T_Sasquatch> I really dont like audiobooks
[5:10:24] <Coystick> Revan is a jerk
[5:10:45] <Rivalshotzgp> I thought I lost hope on Star Wars, but then that clone wars trailer came out
[5:10:49] <+Maids4lyfe> I listen to printed books teaBuns
[5:10:53] <$Cardboard96> Japan's birth rate was been too low since the 60s or something, they're fine
[5:10:56] <+TinoPepino24> podcast are a life saver working as a security guard
[5:11:02] <vonmaultke> Population decreasing is a good problem to have, imagine being China, too many people eating and screwing everywhere
[5:11:11] <BunnyMcFluff> Luke in legends was BS
[5:11:13] <reonome> PLAY FREEBIRD
[5:11:17] <+Ell1ot> will Japan breed better if we show them panda porn?

[5:12:41] <austonamous> you did the thing, I'm big proud of ya
[5:12:59] <platypusgiraffe> hard and fast
[5:13:16] <PsychedelicRev> Streaming is exhausting, even with zero viewers lol
[5:13:18] <Explodincatz> a lot of brainwork
[5:13:30] <Devildavacado> Ennui?
[5:13:36] <%Cogito1001> Ima regret watching this when i go into work in a hour
[5:13:45] <awalr> fresh air is good
[5:13:47] <%Cogito1001> Worth it anyway
[5:13:49] <+VanaSkiller> I do that too
[5:13:50] <jeecay> must be the video portion cause I always feel energized after recording a podcast.
[5:13:56] <vonmaultke> @cyndersquest learn to block out the human body into simple shapes and learn to arrange them then learn details body part by part.
[5:14:00] <Raconteur999> check the fence for stray drones
[5:14:01] <Samex_Comex> That man is standing outside again
[5:14:02] <Huntercd> The dark of night is great
[5:14:15] <+Ell1ot> do you stand out there with your clothes on?
[5:14:17] <reonome> uhhhhhhh
[5:14:28] <%maledictus_faust> stoic eli staring to his long lost homeworld in the sky
[5:14:29] <jeecay> Why are you dragging a coffin behind you Eli
[5:14:33] <sosuke5> Canvas bag
[5:14:33] <@dcn2049> he waits for the cosmic voices to command him
[5:14:34] <Kratok> I love corpses in burlap bags
[5:14:43] <+Maids4lyfe> Everyone should have a burlap bag. I have several.
[5:14:50] <@dcn2049> twitching burlap bags
[5:14:54] <%Cogito1001> or a nylon one either
[5:14:55] <Devildavacado> We used to store potatoes in burlap.
[5:15:00] <$Cardboard96> wearing a burlap sack is also suspicious
[5:15:01] <Huntercd> I hate deer
[5:15:02] <Devildavacado> Potatoes are nice.
[5:15:04] <jeecay> the dear will eat your craps
[5:15:09] <+Invading_Fish> oh deer
[5:15:11] <jeecay> This is why you eat the deer
[5:15:14] <+KawaiiJetty> i join to hear some burlap bags sweet
[5:15:17] <Kratok> Was it Rule of Rose with the moving burlap bags that you could beat until they stopped?
[5:15:26] <+Maids4lyfe> I don't have deer, I have alligators in my yard
[5:15:27] <%maledictus_faust> what if you kill them twice for each blueberry eaten
[5:15:31] <Samex_Comex> She's fating them up to eat them later
[5:15:44] <vonmaultke> Burlap is either dead people, cash or poor people clothes.
[5:16:04] <Huntercd> Deer are stupid
[5:16:09] <jeecay> tasty deer meat
[5:16:23] <$Cardboard96> Deer hate life
[5:16:29] <OrangeGameCinema> Deer meat is cheap because it's under a buck
[5:16:29] <jeecay> Deers get up and walk off getting hit by cars
[5:16:31] <%Cogito1001> My friend fixed his rotten problem by planting Carolina Reapers around the permeter of his garden. That seemed to work, dunno if itll work with deer or larger animals
[5:16:39] <Coystick> litterally born tto die
[5:16:41] <+modmanawesome69> go look up the louis ck deer bit. its the fucking best thing ever
[5:16:45] <+psycosis> if Paige did hit a deer she would hear it then see she hit it
[5:16:52] <Raconteur999> anyone ever read that letter to the editor about moving the deer crossing to a less populated road?
[5:16:54] <$Cardboard96> Missouri is not unlike that
[5:16:57] <juicysal> God I get upset when I nearly hit a stray cat. How the fuck do you get over hitting a damned dear?
