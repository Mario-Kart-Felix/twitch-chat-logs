[0:13:55] <%bettysharkface> 15 minutes boyos.
[0:13:56] <+Cook_4_Souls> Unless you're a corporation that is failing. the government will shower you with praise,
[0:14:04] <Dao_Puppy> 5 minutes of staring wasn't enough?
[0:14:18] <LeafSprout> Canada's stimulus package gives 2k CAD per month, which is 1,433USD
[0:14:21] <majindusto> Ecstasy of Gold is Such an Awesome song tho
[0:14:25] <sonofthedeepsouth> @Cook_4_Souls Based NeoLiberalism
[0:14:27] <%tokenreefer> i heard certain products are already increasing in price
[0:14:34] <+polypolipauli> what would garak look like as a snek lady?
[0:14:52] <sonofthedeepsouth> Good music and art
[0:14:56] <%bettysharkface> I like the fainter one
[0:14:56] <sonofthedeepsouth> awesome
[0:15:06] <LeafSprout> RTX voice can apparently work on other cards, but it's not yet set in stone on how to crack it
[0:15:08] <sonofthedeepsouth> I like the angle tho
[0:15:14] <lost_fortune> now that FF7R has come out, are you looking forward to any games?
[0:15:50] <sonofthedeepsouth> Are the 7r sequels coming annually?
[0:15:59] <%tokenreefer> hardmode is just padding
[0:16:00] <LeafSprout> yeah is there even any upcoming games that people are hyped for before cyberpunk?
[0:16:21] <heytakeiteasyterry> hello plague
[0:16:24] <derangedhobo_> You can enable RTX voice on any card by making some changes in the nvidia files. 10-15% performance hit on 10 series and older. It's in a recent PCGamer article how to do it.
[0:16:30] <locobo98> what a saucy mouse
[0:16:34] <sonofthedeepsouth> Corona fucking up game release dates is quite funny to me
[0:16:42] <%tokenreefer> unfortunately its pretty linear
[0:16:51] <lost_fortune> I think maybe LoU 2, but I don't remember when to what date that has been delayed
[0:16:54] <heytakeiteasyterry> corona also fucking up the u.s economy
[0:17:00] <LeafSprout> @derangedhobo_ that fix doesn't work on many people's machines
[0:17:09] <lost_fortune> *world economy more like
[0:17:17] <%tokenreefer> more like fudged the us economy
[0:17:22] <LeafSprout> my bf has a 1080 and got all kinds of errors when he tried to do that
[0:17:24] <%tokenreefer> world*
[0:17:25] <sonofthedeepsouth> Corona be like hey world economic stability VIBE CHECK
[0:17:34] <%TehBrickz> Oh my fuck twitch makes it hard for me to throw money
[0:17:44] <theenigmaticdude> Ghosts of Tsushima is suppose to come out june, hope it still does
[0:17:45] <%tokenreefer> more like cup check lol
[0:17:45] <sprintmucho> FF7r didn’t ruin my childhood, coronavirus did.
[0:17:48] <%TehBrickz> Anyways.
[0:17:51] <%bettysharkface> Yeah the animal crossing rats are my least favourite
[0:18:06] <LeafSprout> it kinda looks like a yeen
[0:18:17] <locobo98> the proportions are a bitch
[0:18:18] <+HajimenoStream> Good song choice Plague, are you ready for a life under the sun for 8 minutes?
[0:18:19] <derangedhobo_> @LeafSprout Ahh fair, I've not tried it, could be just their test machine is a bit more stable then.
[0:18:19] <sonofthedeepsouth> LUL
[0:18:19] <@DCN2049> they're pretty messed up
[0:18:24] <sonofthedeepsouth> Daily Plague struggle
[0:18:31] <@DCN2049> Well if you're gonna pick the worst looking ones, yes it is
[0:18:32] <Stillchr> what about Ankha, or is that too easy?
[0:18:33] <+Cook_4_Souls> @sonofthedeepsouth More like CoVid-19 vibe checking America.
[0:18:34] <Aussie_Manny> Ah, we're playing Da Samoorai's theme song. BasedGod
[0:18:40] <ShadBo> That's why we're all here. The uncomfortable sexualized anthro's.
[0:18:43] <%bettysharkface> I think Bella is Funshine's favourite though, so he's gonna be stocked to see this when it's done
[0:18:50] <%bettysharkface> stoked*
[0:18:52] <%TehBrickz> Hold on. I need to give you more money
[0:18:55] <%tokenreefer> the fox girls pretty cute dough
[0:18:59] <LeafSprout> just be a furry like me and you'll be fine with sexualizing animal crossing characters
[0:19:12] <sonofthedeepsouth> No
[0:19:17] <Stillchr> Audie is great
[0:19:26] <Aussie_Manny> @PlagueOfGripes Was this put to a vote, or did you just pick this villager personally?
[0:19:46] <%bettysharkface> My favourite is Stitches, he's extra cute in the new game.
[0:20:01] <%CaptHat211> More shortstacks? Yes please.
[0:20:11] <LeafSprout> I like Kicks
[0:20:33] <sonofthedeepsouth> Okay guys this was really bothering and I hope you can help me out. In batman begins Bruce lets rash fall to his death but in the Dark Knight he doesn't let joker fall. What gives?
[0:20:38] <sprintmucho> I still can’t get a grasp around the term shortstacks. It just makes me think of pancakes. Delicious pancakes.
[0:20:45] <Aussie_Manny> Sentimental Eli. louiseyAwh
[0:20:48] <%tokenreefer> is it being a furry if you enjoy anthropomorphic drawings of animals?
[0:20:54] <LeafSprout> yes
[0:21:13] <heytakeiteasyterry> shortstacks are a slang term for pancakes much like flapjacks right?
[0:21:33] <sonofthedeepsouth> Shortstachs aco threads are great tho
[0:21:34] <%tokenreefer> but only drawings... on the side of basically human@leafsprout
[0:21:41] <LeafSprout> yes and no. being a furry is liking anthro characters AND identifying yourself as a furry, that's it
[0:22:02] <+PleasantLee> sup gang
[0:22:06] <%TehBrickz> Twitch won't let me give you more money
[0:22:12] <%TehBrickz> So hotdog
[0:22:17] <%tokenreefer> i basically just like porn pictures lol
[0:22:24] <sprintmucho> @heytakeiteasyterry Yes, sweet buttery pancakes.
[0:22:30] <Aussie_Manny> Ah, man, what the fuck. These songs are funkin'! BasedGod
[0:22:33] <LeafSprout> I mean that kinda makes you a furry then lol
[0:22:54] <%tokenreefer> it is what it is @leafsprout
[0:22:54] <ShadBo> Furry is an incredibly nebulous term. There is a huge assortment of interests and kinks that fit under the one umbrella term.
[0:23:02] <%Samex_Comex> uh oh goth rat
[0:23:13] <Aussie_Manny> What about Super Saiyan 3 Goku?
[0:23:17] <@DCN2049> Asari don't. Only Liara did
[0:23:18] <Aussie_Manny> Or Gamora?
[0:23:24] <+PleasantLee> eyebrows are expressive, they're needeed
[0:23:33] <LeafSprout> I can give you multiple artists that do good lizards without eyebrows plague
[0:23:37] <$doomp12> or just one long scale above each eye
[0:23:39] <sonofthedeepsouth> Hmmm
[0:23:41] <Aussie_Manny> Or Super Saiyan 3 Gamora?
[0:23:45] <sonofthedeepsouth> Give lizard breats too
[0:23:53] <heytakeiteasyterry> animal crossing
[0:23:55] <sonofthedeepsouth> Lizards hould always have breasts
[0:23:55] <%Samex_Comex> big angry eyebrows
[0:24:15] <+PleasantLee> how are people to recognise your sexy mouse is being alluring if their eyebrows dont show it
[0:24:16] <sprintmucho> I’m not proud to admit I’ve gotten into heated debates with friends on why argonian women have breasts
[0:24:19] <%tokenreefer> are freckles just instinctively cute or...?
[0:24:30] <@DCN2049> seems fine so far
[0:24:31] <LeafSprout> its been fine
[0:24:34] <BopBeep> Nay'nt
[0:24:35] <%tokenreefer> pretty solid twitch experience
[0:24:37] <sonofthedeepsouth> Arogians have a case for breats because of the Hist tho
[0:24:49] <sonofthedeepsouth> and the Hist does whatever the fuck it wants
[0:24:51] <lost_fortune> this music is bopin
[0:24:55] <%Samex_Comex> going good on my phone
[0:24:58] <+EpicBigchill> Plague time
[0:25:06] <LeafSprout> this music is perfect vaporwave music
[0:25:08] <+HajimenoStream> twitch is still filled with talentless hacks convincing children to give them their moni
[0:25:12] <LeafSprout> just need to slow it down
[0:25:12] <%tokenreefer> america has been up for a few hours...
[0:25:29] <LeafSprout> @tokenreefer what makes you think i ever sleep

[0:29:57] <sonofthedeepsouth> Gnaging Up
[0:29:59] <%tokenreefer> i feel like the people who watch plague are generally older
[0:30:01] <BopBeep> SourPls
[0:30:02] <+EpicBigchill> You're outta touch
[0:30:08] <%bettysharkface> Hahaha
[0:30:09] <+PleasantLee> come on everybody
[0:30:13] <+PleasantLee> you know the words
[0:30:16] <+EpicBigchill> but its not thursday
[0:30:38] <LeafSprout> i feel like plague is a soulwax fan
[0:31:01] <+PleasantLee> I'M OUTTA TIME!
[0:31:06] <heytakeiteasyterry> @plagueofgripes so my friend what were your thoughts on ff7r?
[0:31:49] <+HajimenoStream> is this music nostalgic for you plague
[0:31:54] <+PleasantLee> I'm outta my head when you're not arooooound
[0:32:08] <+PleasantLee> as the kids say, this slaps
[0:32:31] <%bettysharkface> I think I've only ever heard the chorus of this song
[0:32:38] <+HajimenoStream> I disagree if the seeded feeling is routed in something important enough to you
[0:32:40] <heytakeiteasyterry> @plagueofgripes why so many 1980s songs?
[0:33:04] <%bettysharkface> I grew up listening to the Sisters of Mercy and Souxie and the Banshees
[0:33:22] <+PleasantLee> because the 80's was the best duh, and no other decade should try to compete
[0:33:28] <LeafSprout> @PlagueOfGripes bit of a personal question. What is a good way to find motivation to do work that I enjoy doing, but can't come up with ideas for (3d modeling). I have good self esteem so I can't use that
[0:34:02] <+silvery_cricket> This man sounds out of touch and out of time
[0:34:07] <+HajimenoStream> Anything
[0:34:19] <+HajimenoStream> you wanna 3d model my belly?
[0:34:29] <+PleasantLee> @LeafSprout find a house hold object you like the shape of
[0:34:40] <LixFury> @LeafSprout go on art station and find something thats cool to replicate
[0:34:53] <%Samex_Comex> Your out of lunch
[0:35:00] <+stinkomeanie> Plague thanks to your last art stream I became a huge Fleet Foxes fan. Thank you for introducing me to it.
[0:35:06] <+HajimenoStream> Youre out of thyme
[0:35:57] <LeafSprout> its more like I struggle to find motivation to actually commit to something, even though I know I will enjoy modeling it
[0:36:47] <+HajimenoStream> they say you gotta walk before you run
[0:36:52] <LixFury> then assign a time for modeling and let it become routine
[0:36:54] <+HajimenoStream> crawl before you walk
[0:36:59] <Daxalog> The sketch takes the whole day though.
[0:37:03] <locobo98> thoughts on the new kawai dictator of NK
[0:37:15] <LeafSprout> good advice
[0:37:16] <Dao_Puppy> I like tools. Screwdrivers, scissors, hammers, simple textures on a hundred polys or so.
[0:37:18] <PlebianNoob> What?
[0:37:21] <+HajimenoStream> You gotta shid before you fard
[0:37:29] <lost_fortune> you can always start off with trying recreating N64 models to make it simple
[0:37:35] <+EpicBigchill> @PlagueOfGripes any ideas when you might do another Star Trek stream?
[0:37:47] <%bettysharkface> LUL
[0:37:55] <+PleasantLee> you gotta lube it before you tube it
[0:38:11] <scarboardalive> Idk, watching creative people talk or do what I need inspiration for usually works for me. Like of you need motivation for modeling, find some cool people that models stuff you like
[0:38:17] <LeafSprout> @lost_fortune I did think of low poly models, but I would still want to rig and weight paint those as well, I think ill stick to objects for now
[0:38:23] <+stinkomeanie> Oh your too good to me Mr. Plague ❤️
[0:38:42] <%tokenreefer> 99% perspiration
[0:39:00] <BopBeep> New trek stream will probably come when Pat takes a day off streaming
[0:39:03] <ReNhoSoft1> Hey everyone, gmorning horussProbe
[0:39:10] <heytakeiteasyterry> @plagueofgripes Howdy neighbor
[0:39:13] <LeafSprout> mornin

[0:39:29] <heytakeiteasyterry> hows Kentucky right now in texas its hot as fuck outside
[0:39:32] <+stinkomeanie> I made Quiet Houses my funeral song.
[0:39:32] <%tokenreefer> pat does too many sub only streams
[0:39:35] <%bettysharkface> Oh this is the song that reminds me of Spirited Away
[0:39:50] <%tokenreefer> i just listen to the podcast now
[0:39:59] <LeafSprout> just be subscriber, simple solution
[0:40:03] <LeafSprout> lol
[0:40:22] <%tokenreefer> i dont like being gate kept
[0:40:41] <%tokenreefer> i understand the need though
[0:41:15] <+stinkomeanie> One day I hope to own land and play this music on blast.
[0:41:23] <+HajimenoStream> Thats suprising to hear token
[0:41:33] <+HajimenoStream> I value my time and money a bit too much for that
[0:41:39] <+PleasantLee> majula
[0:41:43] <LeafSprout> kind of unrelated, but I'm hella hyped. The world is SHITTY right now as a whole, with covid19 and trump and all that, but man the art scene, entertainment, and video games are gonna be BOOMIN
[0:41:45] <+zestyArsenic> pat was doing sub only for ff7r because turds spoil all day
[0:41:55] <PlebianNoob> Dang I still need to finish persona
[0:42:09] <+HajimenoStream> Thats one way to handle it for sure
[0:42:15] <+stinkomeanie> I wish I could get into RPGs so I could play this game, love the music and style.
[0:42:22] <voltvexen> funny I was just playing this a few hours ago
[0:42:24] <%tokenreefer> like i said i understand the need. but i. just not about it
[0:42:33] <+PleasantLee> I cant believe persona 5's music called every a gay retard and got away with it
[0:42:56] <LeafSprout> my favorite part about the FF stream was Paige's tweet
[0:43:03] <+HajimenoStream> My HDD ate shit and destroyed my P5 save so Im just gonna get royal and go thru that
[0:43:05] <lost_fortune> that have furries in them?
[0:43:13] <+EpicBigchill> I do, matts big brother
[0:43:16] <+EpicBigchill> Liam
[0:43:16] <theenigmaticdude> I had the p5 theme that played this song on my ps4 for so long
[0:43:20] <+HajimenoStream> Aye i remember
[0:43:32] <+PleasantLee> ohh the ting where pat had a friend, ghost liam
[0:43:35] <%tokenreefer> yea yea yea i remember that
[0:43:39] <+Fnir> yup
[0:43:41] <+PleasantLee> yeah that was a good intro
[0:43:55] <+HajimenoStream> Mental Thriller?
[0:44:01] <KakePews> oh i got a little serie for you
[0:44:14] <LeafSprout> you should watch Zodiac
[0:44:14] <Treuan> I'm a big baby so they're all scary to me
[0:44:23] <comedeity> unsettling
[0:44:31] <%tokenreefer> do you like lynchian stuff?
[0:44:34] <+HajimenoStream> sounds like se7en
[0:44:38] <lost_fortune> so like in Twin Peaks?
[0:44:54] <PlebianNoob> Kinda like that one game with the cat the dropped out of college? I think it is called night in the woods?
[0:44:56] <+stinkomeanie> So Plague did you pick up yoga like everyone else on quarantine?
[0:45:06] <LeafSprout> @PlagueOfGripes would Serial Experiments Lain fall under that?
[0:45:10] <%tokenreefer> surrealistic
[0:45:21] <%bettysharkface> Can we watch Spirited Away some time?
[0:45:46] <+stinkomeanie> “Ugh I’m trash”
[0:46:10] <%tokenreefer> he had a lot of potential that man
[0:46:11] <Jeemukun> I actually just started playing NitW lately, seen playthroughs before so I know the story, but it's still fun
[0:46:15] <Dao_Puppy> Kind of ruined the whole vibe of a dying small town too, made it seem like it was a specific place instead of something more general.
[0:46:16] <LeafSprout> that left arm be lookin weird
[0:46:21] <+Ether101_Prime> Is that the one that took his own life?
[0:47:03] <Jeemukun> @Ether101_Prime that's the one, he did the music for the game, but that whole situation is a big can of worms
[0:47:11] <%tokenreefer> surrealism in media can be great but it definitely can fall flat
[0:47:15] <YoOctober> Wonder what plague is working on today....Oh my hggWoke hggWoke hggWoke
[0:47:20] <Livelinne> Punk mouse🥰
[0:47:23] <+stinkomeanie> Playing Bloodborne while listening. Plague what was your build?
[0:47:47] <LeafSprout> Alec Holowka
[0:47:49] <%tokenreefer> she was his own girlfriend and she abused him
[0:48:12] <+PleasantLee> wheel build
[0:48:17] <%tokenreefer> allegedly
[0:48:18] <+PleasantLee> only wheel builds
[0:48:45] <@DCN2049> not missing too much from the DLC
[0:48:47] <Dao_Puppy> But broccoli builds...
[0:48:49] <lost_fortune> so has fromsoft completely lost you now?
[0:49:55] <Stillchr> Armored Core was great
[0:49:58] <Jeemukun> ye got good taste in music plague
[0:50:06] <+PleasantLee> and sekiro was a stab in the balls for tenchu fans
[0:50:26] <theenigmaticdude> l miss armored core
[0:50:27] <%tokenreefer> sekiro was cool... but i did love tenchu
[0:50:48] <+stinkomeanie> Ditto, loved Tenchu
[0:50:56] <Jeemukun> I did like Sekiro, but I'm also a dirty weeb and japanese history nerd so it got me more for that then anything
[0:51:01] <LeafSprout> not entirely true, the NitW team believed Zoe Quinn because there was other evidence, but there's not enough information to be entirely sure. I'd rather believe a group of people rather than one dude though
[0:51:06] <+PleasantLee> I miss tenchu so much
[0:51:41] <KakePews> Too many awesome games munchk4Cry
[0:51:44] <%tokenreefer> games are not games anymore but amusment park rides
[0:51:48] <Handsome0ne> What about Soma? Did you like it?
[0:52:03] <locobo98> would you say that games have started to become homogenized?
[0:52:08] <%bettysharkface> FFX?
[0:52:08] <voltvexen> what song is this
[0:52:24] <Jeemukun> I've been diving back into the SMT/Persona games myself, need to finish SMTIV still
[0:52:36] <LeafSprout> @PlagueOfGripes same as crisis core
[0:52:42] <locobo98> would it be that games have become presentation obsessed rather than mechanics based?
[0:52:50] <LeafSprout> final fantasy has always had this problem
[0:52:56] <+Ether101_Prime> @LeafSprout You mean all that stuff that got proven to be not true?
[0:52:58] <+stinkomeanie> FFVIIR is the prime example of asking people what they want but the don’t know what they want.
[0:52:59] <LeafSprout> or at least 3d FF did
[0:53:00] <%bettysharkface> The only FF I ever played/finished
[0:53:00] <PlebianNoob> Are you glad that they did it as a remaster, changing the gameplay, or would you have prefered it stayed as a turn based gameplay?
[0:53:14] <%tokenreefer> i think there is a market for real games though. its just hard to know
[0:53:17] <locobo98> where they go LOOK AT THAT rather than go do this
[0:53:19] <+Typhaeon> Been trying to find a game with a decent amount of player freedom, and also writing that isn't dogshit
[0:53:31] <@DCN2049> good
[0:53:39] <Jeemukun> I'm also living through P5R vicariously through Pat's playthrough
[0:53:40] <lost_fortune> what would even be considered a middle tier game back in the day?
[0:53:46] <locobo98> nothins stoppig you from lets plaguing morrowind
[0:53:49] <+PleasantLee> wasnt it sooo cool when rufus started shooting lasers from coins...somehow
[0:54:00] <locobo98> or some other old RPG
[0:54:28] <%tokenreefer> rufus = another scientific railgun.jpg @pleasantlee
[0:54:51] <Livelinne> It’s looking good
[0:55:28] <GoopyEuclid> Like, foreshortening people I find to be really hard if that’s what you mean?
[0:55:36] <%bettysharkface> Beanbag chair?
[0:55:40] <+Shaggnar> Beanbag
[0:55:45] <%tokenreefer> then your arm falls asleep
[0:56:08] <+PleasantLee> have her sitting in one of those 60's chairs, where the back of it is a scoop
[0:56:10] <Dao_Puppy> Throw pillows, throw pillos everywhere.
[0:56:15] <%bettysharkface> Reclining on her man slave?
[0:56:23] <%tokenreefer> fainting chair
[0:56:49] <%bettysharkface> Sorry, I assumed the rats sexuality.
[0:56:54] <Jeemukun> there's those little old couches from like victorian/roman times
[0:56:54] <LeafSprout> @Ether101_Prime that's news to me, the NitW team believed Zoe, and I don't recall seeing anything to contradict that or the evidence provided
[0:57:17] <%bettysharkface> Bot?
[0:57:25] <LeafSprout> ill do it
[0:57:27] <+PleasantLee> would seem so
[0:57:30] <@DCN2049> hrrrrm
[0:57:30] <mesamus> oh plague started the halo 2 song
[0:57:37] <%Samex_Comex> squeak squeak
[0:57:40] <%tokenreefer> valorant bot lol
[0:57:43] <LeafSprout> its a garbage video
[0:57:44] <Livelinne> chilling on hookah?
[0:57:45] <LeafSprout> dont click
[0:57:48] <BopBeep> GTAB
[0:57:48] <LeafSprout> lol
[0:57:53] <@DCN2049> Checking in on it
[0:58:04] <@DCN2049> yeah, bot. Begone
[0:58:12] <+EpicBigchill> Do a froggy chair
[0:58:29] <PoisonFrame> would one of those therapist chair work for that pose?
[0:58:33] <+PleasantLee> I'm still amazed Woolie had never heard Swift Horse from the Shadow of the Colossus OST
[0:58:42] <%tokenreefer> this is from SOTC
[0:58:52] <Livelinne> Ooooh sotc
[0:58:57] <+PleasantLee> should T/O'd Paige
[0:58:58] <%tokenreefer> i played this game for 100s of hours
[0:58:59] <DoostCola> sounds like paige
[0:59:02] <@DCN2049> He probably deserved it
[0:59:02] <theloganbrand> Classic Paige
[0:59:04] <%bettysharkface> There was a dude shitting on you for not enjoying FF7R
[0:59:13] <@DCN2049> Oh yeah, he deserved it
[0:59:14] <%bettysharkface> And she was like, shut the fuck up idiot
[0:59:18] <@DCN2049> guy was going ape shit
[0:59:19] <+PleasantLee> last guardian
[0:59:20] <%bettysharkface> And booped him
[0:59:23] <%bettysharkface> Last Guardian
[0:59:26] <+spacehouse> The Last Guardian
[0:59:28] <%tokenreefer> last guardian
[0:59:33] <%bettysharkface> I named my dog after the beasty
[0:59:34] <%bettysharkface> Trico
[0:59:37] <+stinkomeanie> Last Guardian
[0:59:40] <LeafSprout> is this the "aerith will never fuck you"
[0:59:55] <LeafSprout> or is that a different dude
[0:59:57] <+stinkomeanie> God this song always made my heart sank when I killed a colossus
[0:59:59] <%bettysharkface> "Toriko"
[1:00:04] <+PleasantLee> ;_;
[1:00:11] <Livelinne> “The man eating eagle, Torico" in jp
[1:00:23] <%tokenreefer> i waited 20 years for that game and never played it
[1:00:28] <Livelinne> BibleThump
[1:00:48] <Livelinne> Yah it was harsh
[1:00:50] <@DCN2049> I just wanted another colossus
[1:01:10] <%bettysharkface> I barely remember the game tbh, I just enjoyed big friend
[1:01:17] <%tokenreefer> 10 years too late @dcn2049
[1:01:18] <Jeemukun> at some point it's either bad writing or weird fetish yes
[1:01:23] <+Cook_4_Souls> IS that how you feel about Nier: Automata?
[1:01:49] <%CaptHat211> I’m back.
[1:01:51] <%bettysharkface> Most of my time was spent looking at Trico and just being like "yeah, big"
[1:02:24] <%tokenreefer> it was too on the nose. 10 years of anticipation killed the game
[1:02:25] <+PleasantLee> should have been a petting sim
[1:03:17] <+PleasantLee> automata has 5 canon endings and by the next game none of them will matter
[1:03:19] <%bettysharkface> I wanna make a little harness with wings for my dog Trico
[1:03:41] <+stinkomeanie> Speaking of things that do t respect your time, ever got into One Piece?
[1:03:55] <LeafSprout> no, because it doesn't respect my time
[1:04:10] <+lostforte> eh
[1:04:13] <lost_fortune> it's pretty popular and it probably saves on development time
[1:04:15] <+lostforte> you can play through the game so fast
[1:04:25] <+lostforte> and they skip through a big chunk do to story reasons
[1:04:44] <+r_Foeburden87> papa Nier so much better
[1:04:50] <+PleasantLee> papa nier never really existed woooooooOOOoooo
[1:04:53] <$ViroViranVictus> RIPCheer100 I just wanted you to know the like "..you can slip and slide off my taint for all I care" has been etched on the inside of my skull for nearly half a decade. I cant thank you enough.
[1:05:09] <@DCN2049> Oh wow. Starsiege
[1:05:10] <%bettysharkface> Wot
[1:05:14] <Livelinne> Yeah Japanese developers have this problem. Like there’s basic mentality for "must WORK for the fun!" Kinda
[1:05:15] <+nullC> CYBRIDS!
[1:05:20] <@DCN2049> hahaha
[1:05:22] <+PleasantLee> papa nier is the only choice that makes sense, no brother would go to the lengths for their sister that bro nier does
[1:05:47] <LeafSprout> did you guys check out the travis scott concert for fortnite
[1:06:02] <lost_fortune> man, that Starsiege playthrough is probably my favorite thing on your channel plague
[1:06:06] <Jeemukun> sounds like something out of a C&C game
[1:06:09] <@DCN2049> I liked the other cybrid track more
[1:06:23] <tigerd23> Sounds familiar
[1:06:55] <@DCN2049> There were about two with lyrics
[1:07:05] <+nullC> Probably Mechsoul.
[1:07:11] <%bettysharkface> Vaguely reminds me of the Invader Zim intro
[1:07:16] <@DCN2049> no, not that one
[1:07:29] <Livelinne> @tokenreefer Damn it filler arcs! bitterRiot
[1:07:45] <lost_fortune> get em girls!
[1:07:47] <@DCN2049> I think it was Mechsoul
[1:07:56] <+TaylOctopus91> @pleasantlee But what if Bro Nier wants to f*** his sister? That might be a driving force?
[1:08:07] <@DCN2049> Nope, not that one
[1:08:12] <+PleasantLee> no. *spray bottle*
[1:08:13] <%Samex_Comex> Aw yeah let's fight!
[1:08:13] <+nullC> "I am the one with the mechanoid soul. Without my machine I can never be whole."
[1:08:25] <@DCN2049> Yeah that's it
[1:08:34] <+Left_Justified> hasRight atpChar hasLeft
[1:08:38] <@DCN2049> It was great
[1:08:43] <%bettysharkface> Of course you would like that one Dacon, you fucking mech slut.
[1:08:43] <@Nightbot> Plague is a youtube animator and also streams at https://picarto.tv/Plague . Also: t-shirts! http://goo.gl/lze8QO
[1:08:49] <+stinkomeanie> Sounded like Rob Zombie for a sec
[1:08:51] <@DCN2049> Super mech slut
[1:08:58] <@Nightbot> @tokenreefer -> Much better. [stop spamming emotes] [warning]
[1:08:59] <@DCN2049> But yeah, Mechsoul was my favorite
[1:09:03] <Livelinne> make her hold a WEEED
[1:09:08] <@DCN2049> hahahahaa
[1:09:08] <+Left_Justified> atpCap
[1:09:13] <@DCN2049> Fuck the human campaign
[1:09:42] <Jeemukun> so what're these songs from then?
[1:09:50] <+Left_Justified> bootlegged paint tool sai atpRtsd1 atpRtsd2
[1:10:06] <+TaylOctopus91> @livelinne You mean hold a marry-you-wanna?
[1:10:22] <%tokenreefer> always easier to riff off someone else
[1:10:22] <lost_fortune> talking about how much you want to murder humans
[1:10:37] <+Left_Justified> living dead girl PogChamp
[1:10:38] <lost_fortune> *human animals
[1:10:49] <+reinbachthe3rd> Sup Plague.

[1:11:47] <mortelkilll> thats why i like stuff thats not to ospecific
[1:11:49] <+stinkomeanie> You enjoy any whimsical music like Amelie or Over The Garden Wall?
[1:11:51] <%bettysharkface> I got whole playlists devoted to character backgrounds and D&D campaigns.
[1:11:57] <mortelkilll> so my imagination isnt broken by somethign completely unfitting
[1:12:34] <mortelkilll> my taste in music also compeltely depend on what im working on since im using it to stimulate imagination
[1:12:36] <+TaylOctopus91> More often I'll read something in a book and think of songs to go with the scene if I was making into a movie
[1:12:37] <%tokenreefer> theres certain music that just inspires creativity
[1:12:39] <%Samex_Comex> Uh oh not the moon people
[1:12:40] <%bettysharkface> I actually make playlists before I do any actual writing
[1:12:57] <%bettysharkface> Oh, bamboo princess
[1:12:59] <mortelkilll> cute design

[1:14:23] <+Left_Justified> flipping off the audience? That's very Matt of you atpCap
[1:14:24] <mortelkilll> plague usually does a good job with showing character
[1:14:26] <%Samex_Comex> Go back to the moon Mr.Ed
[1:14:33] <Aussie_Manny> What is this Xenoverse 2 hub world music?
[1:14:43] <%tokenreefer> saucy little mouse

[1:15:49] <theloganbrand> All bets on Dolly
[1:15:50] <SenkoFluff> its the satanic rituals Kappa
[1:15:53] <+stinkomeanie> “Look America, I kissed a woman this time.” - Madonna
[1:15:54] <+PleasantLee> saw that bath tub video of her recently, I thought it was some rich asian lady going nuts
[1:15:57] <%bettysharkface> She has been accused of art theft, but the artists don't get anywhere with it
[1:16:00] <mortelkilll> oh you meant the person...strangely i dont think i ever really cared for how signers looked
[1:16:06] <Aussie_Manny> I swear that was a joke in Family Guy. "You look like, if I touched you, you'd be sticky." Or was that Gwen Stefani..?
[1:16:09] <mortelkilll> i almsot never watch the videos
[1:16:15] <%tokenreefer> @pleasantlee yup thats the one
[1:16:32] <voltvexen> this song smacks ngl
[1:16:35] <+stinkomeanie> “I kissed a black guy who pretended to be Jesus in a Pepsi commercial” - Also Madonna
[1:16:37] <%Engwithan_Elder_God> She was hot in the Like a Prayer video.
[1:16:53] <+Left_Justified> @stinkomeanie atpBigot
[1:16:57] <%tokenreefer> apparently celebrities are losing favor recently
[1:17:18] <@Nightbot> @Livelinne -> Questionable judgement. [stop spamming emotes] [warning]
[1:17:33] <+Left_Justified> @livelinne atpLaw atpWind
[1:17:35] <%tokenreefer> madonna was hot in that movie with william dafoe

[1:18:21] <mortelkilll> its fun to have characters that are creepy and byzzare
[1:18:22] <%Samex_Comex> That's why they are moving to islands
[1:18:23] <@DCN2049> There are a lot of nightmare creatures
[1:18:24] <%tokenreefer> apparently william dafoe got a HUGE Squid2 Squid4
[1:18:31] <SenkoFluff> it gets worse if you step into the fandom
[1:18:35] <ReNhoSoft1> interesting
[1:18:42] <mortelkilll> i understand that animal crossing doesnt want to be p[opulated with bland peopel so they have weird people everywehre
[1:18:43] <+Left_Justified> that deep voiced pelican in the sunglasses atpBird
[1:18:49] <+TaylOctopus91> Animal Crossing Into The Beyond
[1:18:52] <%bettysharkface> Like Stitches is my favourite, but he's a living patchwork teddy. And Merengue is a rhino with a strawberry for a nose.
[1:18:58] <@DCN2049> Check out Coco sometime
[1:19:00] <mortelkilll> and sicne you know none of them are dangerous you find them quirky and endearing instead of creepy
[1:19:02] <%bettysharkface> Which realistically is gonna become a bad time.
[1:19:14] <Jeemukun> there's that one octopus whose head is literally a takoyaki
[1:19:29] <@DCN2049> Gyroids
[1:19:30] <%bettysharkface> Gyroids
[1:19:33] <@DCN2049> Jinx

[1:20:48] <Jeemukun> gyroids are based off acient japanese burial statues, still horrifying though
[1:20:58] <mortelkilll> they are creepy cute to me
[1:20:59] <+Left_Justified> SourPls
[1:21:02] <mortelkilll> cute because they are creepy
[1:21:13] <mortelkilll> i liek that they sing
[1:21:20] <+stinkomeanie> Back when shirts with no sense of pattern and clashing colors were considered fashion.
[1:21:21] <+Left_Justified> I hope not DansGame
[1:21:29] <%tokenreefer> theres no market for this music in 2020
[1:21:35] <Livelinne> That inflated bunny is the creepiest to me
[1:21:44] <+Left_Justified> @tokenreefer bandcamp :)
[1:21:46] <%CaptHat211> I first saw Gyroids in the Kirby series

[1:23:18] <Livelinne> @mortelkilll Yeah seems like it. To me he? Just reminds me of Robby
[1:23:39] <mortelkilll> i think people just dont like the idea of not knowing what he really is

[1:28:39] <%bettysharkface> There's a piano cover of this I love
[1:28:52] <+stinkomeanie> Who originally sang this again?
[1:28:56] <@Nightbot> Plague is a youtube animator and also streams at https://picarto.tv/Plague . Also: t-shirts! http://goo.gl/lze8QO
[1:28:58] <%tokenreefer> lots of soul in it
[1:28:58] <%bettysharkface> Childish Gambino

[1:30:58] <mortelkilll> i see the original is rap, i sadly rarely like it
[1:31:05] <Livelinne> Stay woke?
[1:31:13] <+Left_Justified> big head mode: deactivated MiniK
[1:31:32] <+TaylOctopus91> Originally I thought it was "creepin" but just now I heard "creamin"
[1:31:35] <%tokenreefer> @mortelkilll the original is barely rap
[1:31:38] <%bettysharkface> @PlagueOfGripes The piano cover doesn't have any lyrics, you might like it, very atmospheric
[1:31:49] <+Left_Justified> it's not. it's funk. ffs
[1:31:51] <mortelkilll> i dont know the exact genres
[1:32:00] <+Left_Justified> zoomers these days
[1:32:06] <ChattyWhacker> I am *something* right now and I must say I'm feeling good.
[1:32:20] <Livelinne> "Stay woke instead being creepy"?? woolieWUT
[1:32:30] <%tokenreefer> its the fact he is mostly a rapper
[1:32:54] <%bettysharkface> It's not super different, they stayed pretty close, bit more flair on their part
[1:32:55] <+Left_Justified> motown flare atpQuan
[1:32:59] <mortelkilll> yeah make sense, the rest of the song did sound different but i dont know the genre of that

[1:35:39] <+Left_Justified> he really is
[1:35:46] <ChattyWhacker> I like the color blue
[1:35:48] <%tokenreefer> i think nows truly the time to be up
[1:35:49] <VoxFoxWatch> Love this song.
[1:36:02] <reiface08> is this gadget from rescue rangers or an AC villager
[1:36:04] <mortelkilll> oh i had the wrong song of the author
[1:36:10] <BopBeep> I hope it's tomorrow since oat is only doing the podcast
[1:36:11] <ChattyWhacker> the song is pretty smooth
[1:36:12] <VoxFoxWatch> The fact that Plague is hummin’ to the beat makes it better, somehow.
[1:36:21] <+Left_Justified> dat bass Kreygasm
[1:36:23] <+Scevda> Seems to smug for gadget.
[1:36:24] <%CaptHat211> Plague, you ought to check out the Hu.
[1:36:38] <VoxFoxWatch> Redbone FTW.
[1:36:44] <+TaylOctopus91> @reiface08 Nice pull! But it's a villager
[1:36:46] <mortelkilll> make more sense
[1:36:55] <reiface08> aaah
[1:37:14] <%bettysharkface> Please consider checking out the piano cover if you like this song, it's better in my opinion. Builds on a lot of the good parts of the song.
[1:37:21] <+Left_Justified> hey, you oughta check out ( atpShh no one gives a crap )
[1:37:30] <+TaylOctopus91> @capthat211 Yuvey yuve yu?
[1:37:45] <+Scevda> Gotta get you relaaaaaaxed Eli.
[1:37:46] <mortelkilll> kinda reminded of the music in the cafe of persona 5

[1:38:06] <%bettysharkface> o vo
[1:38:14] <mortelkilll> guess its really just the tone
[1:38:27] <mortelkilll> oh also
[1:38:29] <+TaylOctopus91> Dat nose. *chef kiss*
[1:38:36] <mortelkilll> feel a bit sad
[1:38:38] <%bettysharkface> Hush, listen
[1:38:44] <ChattyWhacker> I never got into slice of life stuff
[1:39:01] <+stinkomeanie> This is a love confession song
[1:39:03] <mortelkilll> sometime you want to see people face normal peopel problems
[1:39:08] <+Left_Justified> My hood can't be this kawaii BibleThump
[1:39:08] <mortelkilll> and not have big huge epci adventures
[1:39:11] <+stinkomeanie> Or a “I’m moving to another town” music
[1:39:27] <mortelkilll> it would be somewhat of a tragedy music
[1:39:28] <+Left_Justified> ebin
[1:39:35] <Livelinne> Gotta watch Nichijou someday...
[1:39:43] <ChattyWhacker> is it odd that the Doki Doki Literature Club music still get's to me
[1:39:52] <mortelkilll> its kind of meant to
[1:40:00] <ChattyWhacker> ture
[1:40:04] <+Scevda> Plague is a breath of fresh air when it comes to stream music. With such content you usually get Nightcore bs.
[1:40:07] <VoxFoxWatch> I always need to be in the mood to draw perfectly. Like if my mind says “THIS WILL BE PERFECT, WORK ON IT, NEVER STOP.” it’ll be so. But if my mind says “this is a normal drawing day, let’s make a concept drawing for what we want.” I’ll draw a rough copy for what I want... then it’ll stay a rough copy... forever. The curse that is the MOOD, an artists friend and enemy, I suppose. Always good to hit an art stream BTW, and to have Redbone to boot makes it far better. Cheer100 Cheer100 Cheer100
[1:40:09] <+Left_Justified> @livelinne isn't that the one where the teacher german suplexed a deer?
[1:40:13] <SilverRoddo> Can’t wait for Eli’s Netflix animated show.
[1:40:17] <+TaylOctopus91> Also kinda reminds me of parts of Air Gear when the characters would try to get all serious and motivated to do the motorized rollerblade tricks even HARDER
[1:40:41] <%CaptHat211> Go to YT and check out the Hu (Mongolian Metal)
[1:40:44] <+RayDaug> Man, I know it's a skill that you have to learn like everything else, but computer drawing is still the craziest thing in the world to me
[1:40:45] <%bettysharkface> Liszt? The Paganini of Piano?
[1:40:50] <Livelinne> @left_justified Yeah I think so. And other memes LUL
[1:41:08] <kirby9b> hello stream
[1:41:09] <Kittyminati> do you mean la campanella?
[1:41:12] <cap_bon> whats the name of that song thats just designed to be as unpleasant as possible to the human ear
[1:41:15] <+Left_Justified> @capthat211 I don't like you. atpBigot
[1:41:17] <Livelinne> Hi!
[1:41:19] <MrHappyFunshine> oh yay Bella
[1:41:23] <+stinkomeanie> Like a violinist who play the Devil’s Thrill successfully then say “I quit the violin forever, thank you”
[1:41:28] <ChattyWhacker> al capella?
[1:41:35] <%CaptHat211> @Left_Justified I can live with that.
[1:41:43] <mortelkilll> @VoxFoxWatch Kind of need to learn to draw when your mood isnt ideal if its your career. Not the same as overworking yourself trough ,thats bad too
[1:41:49] <+Left_Justified> @capthat211 don't at me atpShh
[1:42:01] <availablethor> List and Bartok were quite something. Remember learning about them in elementary school. I went to a musical elementary for a while.
[1:42:02] <+Left_Justified> ResidentSleeper
[1:42:05] <ChattyWhacker> I recommend don't ever listen to me
[1:42:07] <mortelkilll> musical tastes are very diverse
[1:42:10] <%bettysharkface> @PlagueOfGripes Did I let you down? o no
[1:42:21] <mortelkilll> so often you show a song you liek to someone and they just dotn like it
[1:42:22] <+TaylOctopus91> Ye ye ya!
[1:42:32] <cap_bon> oh no now im being reminded of MSV :(

[1:43:00] <+Left_Justified> a long long time ago atpFeelsBeardMan
[1:43:04] <+Hobo_Box> I need to play MGS V again
[1:43:07] <VoxFoxWatch> @mortelkilll It’s an odd thing, I want to start posting art, not as a career (at least now), but to show the world what I can make.
[1:43:07] <shameimarusen> enbRespect
[1:43:13] <+PleasantLee> somehow did waaaay worse on that attempt
[1:43:13] <+TaylOctopus91> Mide Urge?
[1:43:14] <+stinkomeanie> Klaus Nomi?
[1:43:15] <ChattyWhacker> I'd rather eat randy
[1:43:22] <Livelinne> bitterEnd
[1:43:25] <%bettysharkface> If you describe the song I might...
[1:43:28] <%CaptHat211> Bowie?
[1:43:32] <SilverRoddo> bitterEnd this song is pretty good
[1:43:35] <VoxFoxWatch> The man who sold the world.....
[1:43:41] <Treuan> Davie
[1:43:45] <mortelkilll> @VoxFoxWatch yeah, i experience that too, just working on your own isnt enough, you need an online presence
[1:44:00] <+Shotgundam009> Heres to you Nicola and bart 🍺
[1:44:08] <+stinkomeanie> You ever watch the video of David Bowie and Klaus Nomi singing this song and Bowie struggling to keep up with Klaus?
[1:44:18] <MrHappyFunshine> the midge version is better than Bowie but i still like the Bowie version
[1:44:29] <ChattyWhacker> @foxynews
[1:44:33] <Livelinne> I still can’t believe we’ve lost Bowie and Prince in SAME YEAR BibleThump
[1:44:53] <MrHappyFunshine> Venom Snake is a sad story
[1:45:13] <+stinkomeanie> No love for the Nirvana version?
[1:45:18] <+TaylOctopus91> I still need to finish MGS V
[1:45:27] <ChattyWhacker> I never understood metal gear
[1:45:32] <Emeralddragon2> MrDestructoid
[1:45:39] <+Hobo_Box> MGS V was one of my favorite games of that year and it wasn't even finished
[1:45:50] <cap_bon> MGV has some interesting plot trapped inside a really rushed and padded out game
[1:45:52] <+Ultimate_Edge> Everything has to come back to robot with nukes
[1:46:01] <ChattyWhacker> I never understood FF7 either
[1:46:01] <@DCN2049> robots were better than the virus that killed based on the language you heard
[1:46:01] <VoxFoxWatch> @ @mortelkilll yep. My fiends always say that it’s self-promotion that you should do, but I feel like that if you try to push your face onto everyone, you come off as a Dick. And no one wants to be a Dick, look at that one guy, he was all like “My friends call me... Dick.” And the world flipped out. Lol.
[1:46:04] <+TaylOctopus91> "Words can kill" blegh
[1:46:07] <%bettysharkface> @PlagueOfGripes In terms of the song you're trying to remember, was it perhaps a cover of one of the songs you listen to a lot on stream? What a fool believes?
[1:46:15] <%CaptHat211> Why won't they let us have nice things, Plague?
[1:46:17] <MaybeThePotato> but that guy wasn't a metal gear or snake
[1:46:17] <+Scevda> Way outta left field: Have you watched Band of Brothers and the Pacific?
[1:46:18] <%Samex_Comex> Foxdie?
[1:46:33] <ChattyWhacker> is he the clone or not? Doesn't matter
[1:47:02] <%bettysharkface> Hm, not one I've shared then, I don't think so
[1:47:23] <VoxFoxWatch> @dcn2049 Considering that the robot was sorta going to be the focus for the end, until SOME PEOPLE decided to cut that from the game and leave it on a blue-ray... would’ve been great.
[1:47:42] <Aussie_Manny> Doesn't matter, METAL GEAAAAARRR!
[1:47:59] <MrHappyFunshine> ooooh funky
[1:48:00] <ChattyWhacker> metal gear?
[1:48:08] <+Scevda> So refreshing.

[1:49:45] <mortelkilll> kingdom heart isnt a compelx story, its a super simple good vs evil, its just awfully told
[1:49:54] <ChattyWhacker> ooooh
[1:49:56] <mortelkilll> way to omuch useless informatio nthat lead nowhere
[1:50:09] <%Samex_Comex> Even when you think it's perfect you look away then back then you notice the head is too big :(
[1:50:21] <Aussie_Manny> Ohh, I know this song!
[1:50:23] <Emeralddragon2> cirBox this song is bangin
[1:50:25] <%bettysharkface> It's alright~
[1:50:31] <mortelkilll> i liek the cool moments in kingdom heart but its obvious tha tthe game was designed for them and they just tryed to weave a story around it
[1:50:47] <Aussie_Manny> Man, where's CeeLo Green been for the past 8 years?
[1:50:48] <MrHappyFunshine> I need Bella on my island
[1:50:56] <mortelkilll> hmmm so maybe change project and go back t othis later?

[1:54:43] <mortelkilll> that ould kind of be an interestign read i suppose
[1:55:02] <shameimarusen> If I dont out like an hour long track half my time drawing is spent changing music
[1:55:37] <kirby9b> yeah I feel ya, rather have the music constantly change
[1:55:55] <kirby9b> just to keep my mind not bored while drawing
[1:56:36] <+stinkomeanie> That was quick I hope you didn’t hurt yourself for our sake Plague

[2:05:57] <%bettysharkface> The 2nd tried a little too hard
[2:06:08] <MrHappyFunshine> agreed
[2:06:09] <%bettysharkface> And then in the Infinity War they went full stupid
[2:06:20] <%bettysharkface> As if they weren't already
[2:06:34] <%bettysharkface> It's a shame, but eh

[2:10:20] <Phantom_of_The_Library> i am unsure how to feel about bluegrass float on, this feels like heresy, but its not bad heresy
[2:10:20] <+corvo_limburger> thank you for the music to add to to the collections
[2:10:41] <+Scevda> EGAD!
[2:10:43] <DehiDehi> Where can I buy my own Plague DJ ?

[2:10:51] <%Samex_Comex> And watch the Thing and Conan a bunch too
[2:10:52] <Livelinne> clempsMischief

[2:11:11] <chronoxgp> i jus bought some mountain music
[2:11:14] <MrHappyFunshine> everyonein here like general Grievous snatching up songs for their collection
[2:11:16] <+Scevda> Time for water!

[2:11:24] <chronoxgp> by thayer cabin, they aren't great but they have a 2nd cd
[2:11:38] <+Sgthor> Everyone don't forget to cirSip and walk around if you gotta
[2:11:57] <Livelinne> dechartHydrate dechartHydrate dechartHydrate
[2:12:09] <%bettysharkface> @PlagueOfGripes What's that song you used to play sometimes, sounded kinda like a Rob Zombie song...something about milk? Always reminded me of that song at the start of FFX
[2:12:16] <Daxalog> You cant physically fight in chat
[2:12:20] <DillionPHCO> What a policy
[2:12:24] <+Scevda> Ya sure
[2:12:27] <Livelinne> woolieCHAN
[2:12:30] <+Scevda> Sounds fun.
[2:12:40] <%Samex_Comex> Play I like big butts from Sir mix alot
[2:12:40] <S4boar> your going to subject the chat to a battle royal
[2:12:40] <2Sam4Hall> If your song doesn't get played its a perm ban

[2:13:01] <%bettysharkface> Hahahaa
[2:13:08] <%bettysharkface> Oh really?
[2:13:18] <%bettysharkface> Now you got me piqued
[2:13:21] <DehiDehi> this is not country music
[2:13:24] <+Scevda> It did? Interesting.
[2:13:25] <TheOverwhelmingShotgun> one of the universe's most tightly guarded secrets is that of Eli's Playlist
[2:13:35] <%Samex_Comex> White Zombie
[2:13:36] <%CaptHat211> I've been there, Eli.
[2:13:57] <chronoxgp> i watch a yugioh dude who lets people do songrequest in chat
[2:13:59] <carsnova> When are we gonna hear the bluegrass version?
[2:14:06] <chronoxgp> people mostly post meme garbage and weeb stuff
[2:14:16] <@DCN2049> well I came back to a genre shift
[2:14:30] <chronoxgp> but it's always a full playlist when people !songrequest youtubelink
[2:14:38] <%bettysharkface> Do it do it do it
[2:14:39] <+Scevda> Release the manuscript?!
[2:14:49] <MrHappyFunshine> that sounds like fun
[2:14:52] <%CaptHat211> "Then rocks fell and everyone died. The End."
[2:14:54] <@DCN2049> And they can be the rumored lost chapters
[2:14:55] <%bettysharkface> I must have missed that one
[2:14:57] <AvidLite> "And then everyone died, the end"
[2:14:59] <SilverRoddo> Reclaw Recollections?
[2:15:15] <+Scevda> I want there for that one and now I regret it.
[2:15:46] <Livelinne> I like that muscle dude story
[2:15:53] <MrHappyFunshine> This rat has had too much vacation juice
[2:16:05] <SilverRoddo> Hold a ghost writer contest to choose to write the final chapter.
[2:16:53] <%Samex_Comex> It was all a dream and they lived happily ever after the end
[2:17:06] <+Scevda> Whats this obsession with everything being juice and where did it come from?!
[2:17:39] <MrHappyFunshine> Vacation juice is animal crossings version of alcohol
[2:17:43] <+corvo_limburger> i like your animations
[2:17:53] <Livelinne> @scevda It’s a meme from Pocket Camp
[2:17:59] <%zk_nails> full circle
[2:17:59] <carsnova> Video essays are really popular in general right now
[2:18:09] <+Scevda> K, ty @livelinne
[2:18:12] <MrHappyFunshine> you have a lot of interesting things to say and solid advice
[2:18:25] <Livelinne> Your welcome!
[2:18:27] <DehiDehi> FeelsBadMan
[2:18:28] <TheOverwhelmingShotgun> Plague did you watch that Lindsay Ellis video about publishing books?
[2:18:43] <DehiDehi> Existential dread initiated
[2:19:00] <+psydaku> this song is childhood
[2:19:17] <%CaptHat211> I'm working on getting some books published
[2:19:28] <Livelinne> Doninshis! woolieMIRIN
[2:19:34] <%bettysharkface> @PlagueOfGripes You talk constantly about hating animating, continue to do it, and when people tell you they would rather you do things other than animation, you are that picture of shocked pikachu.
[2:20:25] <+Scevda> Honestly Im up for anything Eli.
[2:20:35] <+psydaku> Oldies really knew how to romanticize one night stands lol
[2:20:45] <+BubbaRands> oh well oh well!
[2:21:08] <SilverRoddo> It was the style at the time.
[2:21:09] <AvidLite> I just want plague to validate all my negative opinions about anime.
[2:21:13] <+Falsehoode> aplNut
[2:21:21] <+BubbaRands> eeney meeny myney moe Kreygasm
[2:21:25] <%Samex_Comex> And then I'm sad
[2:21:32] <DillionPHCO> alkXD
[2:21:38] <DillionPHCO> What the fuck is wrong with you
[2:21:54] <+PleasantLee> wow
[2:21:56] <+PleasantLee> ....wow
[2:22:04] <+PleasantLee> the super boss in 7r is pathetic
[2:22:05] <MrHappyFunshine> wow
[2:22:22] <+EpicBigchill> A, B, C, D Girlllllllllll~
[2:22:43] <chronoxgp> i like trials more than 7 so far
[2:22:56] <+PleasantLee> and it gives you something called god damnation, presumpt much
[2:22:57] <%tokenreefer> ff7r ending was lazy as heck
[2:22:58] <chronoxgp> trials didn't throw a freaking 3 part side quest mission in my face
[2:23:13] <+BubbaRands> I love the end of old school songs where the singer just starts singing whatever LUL "Roses are red and violets and blue"
[2:23:34] <+Scevda> My favorite version of the “shirt covering” pic Eli has done is the Tem from Undertale.
[2:23:37] <+psydaku> Riffing is a lost art
[2:23:43] <chronoxgp> this sounds like Pat Bateman's mixtape
[2:23:56] <chronoxgp> is plague a sociopathic serial killer?
[2:23:57] <+PleasantLee> HOLY SHIT CHADLEY REVELATIONS
[2:24:01] <%bettysharkface> "Roses are red, violets are blue, you replied first, I guess you'll do"
[2:24:10] <%CaptHat211> The Tem art is great
[2:24:55] <%bettysharkface> I don't know it
[2:24:57] <+Scevda> Ride that Undertale fans viewership.
[2:24:59] <+BubbaRands> yep
[2:25:00] <+psydaku> i havent heard of it
[2:25:07] <+Scevda> Nah I have.
[2:25:07] <Shardlab> I hear it a lot at work
[2:25:10] <%CaptHat211> I like it.
[2:25:24] <kirby9b> nope
[2:25:27] <%bettysharkface> Reminds me a bit of that earlier Cee Lo track
[2:25:36] <chronoxgp> yeah the talking headsin your fridge told me about this song
[2:25:48] <chronoxgp> the blonde one, you know her name
[2:25:59] <MrHappyFunshine> i don't remember music well so probably have heard it
[2:26:08] <+PleasantLee> well, thats FF7r platinum'd
[2:26:35] <+PleasantLee> now to uninstall the 100gigs
[2:26:38] <%bettysharkface> @PleasantLee But have you gotten every ending in Disco Elysium
[2:26:44] <+Sgthor> SourPls
[2:26:50] <MrHappyFunshine> That sounds like suffering Lee
[2:27:02] <+PleasantLee> @bettysharkface sure did!
[2:27:10] <eldercat> montygJams
[2:27:13] <%bettysharkface> Doubt.
[2:27:26] <+PleasantLee> :')
[2:27:36] <carsnova> That sounds like it would take forever
[2:27:39] <+Scevda> What genre is this considered?
[2:27:53] <+PleasantLee> I did enjoy the hard mode alittle, was more of a challenge in good MP management
[2:28:01] <+PleasantLee> gave a reason for mako shards to be in boxes
[2:28:06] <+PleasantLee> precious mako shards
[2:28:20] <+joszanarky> I want that mouse pus
[2:28:28] <%bettysharkface> Fun fact, my animal crossing island is called Revachol, and my town tune is the main piano refrain from the boat ride.
[2:28:58] <@Nightbot> Plague is a youtube animator and also streams at https://picarto.tv/Plague . Also: t-shirts! http://goo.gl/lze8QO
[2:29:03] <%bettysharkface> And when Disco Elysium comes to the Switch, I might stop playing AC long enough to play it
[2:29:18] <@DCN2049> I'll probably get it too, just because then I'll actually devote time to it
[2:29:22] <+psydaku> ooof
[2:29:24] <+Scevda> Nightbot plz dont bulli ; (
[2:29:25] <theenigmaticdude> yeah, love this song
[2:29:28] <+PleasantLee> I'd watch a disco elysium cartoon
[2:29:47] <@DCN2049> god damn
[2:29:49] <%Samex_Comex> What!?
[2:29:51] <+Sgthor> That 1st lline oof

[2:29:57] <Livelinne> Wot
[2:30:05] <+psydaku> ok i wasnt being insane
[2:30:06] <%CaptHat211> Let's go
[2:30:08] <Miikaaeeel> You think so?
[2:30:15] <%bettysharkface> I am pre-emptively sad about any future games ZA/UM make, because I would just put way too much hope that they'll make something better
[2:30:27] <@DCN2049> yeah okay
[2:30:29] <carsnova> Oh no
[2:30:31] <Mrman617> WutFace
[2:30:32] <SilverRoddo> Hebdophilia, or however that word is spoken.
[2:30:32] <+JailShmixRemix> Oh no
[2:30:33] <+BubbaRands> ohhh...
[2:30:36] <shameimarusen> Kekw
[2:30:36] <+stinkomeanie> Remember “Seventeen” by Winger?
[2:30:40] <+Scevda> Well then.
[2:30:41] <+PleasantLee> 16 is legal in uk
[2:30:41] <Livelinne> Oh damn
[2:30:54] <Murphio_GS> Fuckin yikes
[2:30:57] <eldercat> Yeah sounds like it .
[2:30:59] <+Sgthor> "Great song though" LUL
[2:31:00] <voltvexen> senjuHate
[2:31:04] <@DCN2049> Debatable
[2:31:04] <+BubbaRands> "Take you into the night" WutFace
[2:31:06] <Miikaaeeel> "Plague endorses pedophilia"
[2:31:14] <@DCN2049> Or 37
[2:31:24] <%Samex_Comex> Oingo boingo has a song called Little girls
[2:31:28] <%bettysharkface> I wanted to talk about Disco Elysium, but I guess now we're talking about pedos
[2:31:31] <+psydaku> maybe the speaker is younger....
[2:31:35] <theenigmaticdude> Yeah yikes, but l still like the song
[2:31:41] <Shardlab> ...wow. I thought he said "we" were 16 years old, not "she"
[2:31:48] <Shardlab> Damn
[2:31:59] <Livelinne> woolieOMG woolieOMG woolieOMG
[2:31:59] <MrHappyFunshine> Plague only endorseswearing LaBrava like a sleeve
[2:32:02] <voltvexen> this sounds 80s
[2:32:09] <+Scevda> That would be nice shardlab.
[2:32:10] <mortelkilll> honestly being 18 years old isnt that much better
[2:32:22] <mortelkilll> like yo ushouldnt date people udner 25 if you are over 30
[2:32:24] <SilverRoddo> Maybe her body is affected by the theory of relativity and ages quicker?
[2:32:31] <%nerdbayne> thanks for ruining this song for me, plague
[2:32:38] <+Sgthor> She's only 60 years old
[2:32:39] <Shardlab> Unless he's some young buck senior in high school, this song ain't right
[2:32:45] <+Scevda> Highechool senior dates high school sophomore.
[2:32:49] <+Sgthor> Change the lyrics to that, much better LUL
[2:33:01] <+BubbaRands> The 80
[2:33:12] <+BubbaRands> The 80's were weird man...
[2:33:19] <+Scevda> Mhmmm
[2:33:29] <%bettysharkface> Sometimes it just takes one lyric to ruin a song
[2:33:32] <+PleasantLee> hmm, seems this song is about the guys wife
[2:33:42] <+PleasantLee> and she is abit yonger than mr benny
[2:34:13] <mortelkilll> maturity difference i think is the main issue
[2:34:34] <mortelkilll> you should follow age brackets rather than arbitrary numbers like legal age of consent
[2:34:43] <%bettysharkface> Jesus
[2:34:47] <ChattyWhacker> hold on, I was born in the 80's. you saying I'm weird?!
[2:34:48] <mortelkilll> peopel are super confused and inexperienced under 25
[2:34:59] <+PleasantLee> wow
[2:35:01] <+BubbaRands> oooh...
[2:35:02] <@DCN2049> hahahaha
[2:35:04] <Miikaaeeel> monkaS
[2:35:05] <+Sgthor> Um the music video description is major ooffff
[2:35:06] <+BubbaRands> yaay...
[2:35:06] <+psydaku> OOF ALMIGHTY
[2:35:06] <+EpicBigchill> oof
[2:35:06] <carsnova> Oh dang
[2:35:09] <Treuan> Sudden spike in pedophilia
[2:35:12] <Livelinne> OhMyDog OhMyDog OhMyDog
[2:35:13] <5Two> That's my Dads age...
[2:35:15] <splicerss> Hey plague do you have any tips for learning to draw in perspective? I’m having trouble finding good references
[2:35:18] <%Samex_Comex> That's old
[2:35:21] <shameimarusen> enbDamegami enbDamegami
[2:35:21] <+PleasantLee> hes probably a kid concieved when his dad came home from the war
[2:35:24] <+EpicBigchill> Girl, its only a 20 year difference
[2:35:25] <@DCN2049> " Benny Mardones tells us that the 16-year-old girl he's singing about was named Heidi, and she lived in his apartment in Spanish Harlem."
[2:35:27] <DehiDehi> age aint nothin but a number brother KKona
[2:35:27] <voltvexen> older than my gran pap
[2:35:29] <ChattyWhacker> ....I'm 34
[2:35:36] <SilverRoddo> What if this song is part of a story that is a concept album, i mean, we’re not getting the full story, completely out of context.
[2:35:37] <BabyNaBackbrace> great time to show up
[2:35:40] <eldercat> Shoot fire
[2:35:47] <+PleasantLee> HAVE A HEART! LOVE is LOVE
[2:35:49] <+stinkomeanie> She’s only 26, she’s only 28, she’s only 37, she’s only 48 with all the re-recording
[2:35:51] <mortelkilll> @DehiDehi that onyl really work when yo uget past the 25-30 and both peopel fully matured
[2:35:51] <voltvexen> song ruined :c
[2:35:55] <+Scevda> Your twang came through a little there.
[2:35:58] <ChattyWhacker> I mean, I'm 34 and drunk so whatever
[2:36:18] <Livelinne> Well thanks for the nightmare Eli woolieDATTEBAYO
[2:36:25] <Brandon_Weavers> Ah, I see plague is drawing furry stuff again
[2:36:26] <SilverRoddo> Sounds like Our Lady Peace
[2:36:47] <PoisonFrame> so @mortelkilll do you suggests we rob people of there own personal choice then?
[2:36:49] <+PleasantLee> maybe we change the lyrics a little
[2:36:55] <ChattyWhacker> "great" is subjective
[2:37:00] <mortelkilll> all songs are characters, yo ucan enjoy the song and hate the character in the song
[2:37:19] <mortelkilll> sometime the character is litteraly just the person but take al lsongs as fiction
[2:37:20] <+PleasantLee> "shes very mature for her age"
[2:37:30] <SilverRoddo> The word “great” is varied these days.
[2:37:34] <+PleasantLee> She's very mature for her age!
[2:37:45] <mortelkilll> i liste nto a lot of songs where the character i nthe sogn is an awful person
[2:37:46] <%Samex_Comex> WutFace
[2:37:46] <+BubbaRands> She's just 16 (+10 years so she's at the age of mental maturity) !
[2:37:56] <Livelinne> stoppppp
[2:37:59] <+brudus_maximus> "Horny old man pokes fun at other horny old man"
[2:38:24] <+Sgthor> Why are there so Snek ladies in Animal Crossing cirBaka
[2:38:28] <mortelkilll> it get tricky when peopel sing what they actually believed
[2:38:35] <ChattyWhacker> I could listen to adam sandler songs right now
[2:38:35] <mortelkilll> yeah good point
[2:38:37] <+Sgthor> no snek ladies* excuse me
[2:38:39] <mortelkilll> everyone is garbage
[2:38:42] <@DCN2049> Damn right he is
[2:38:51] <TheOverwhelmingShotgun> what about tom hanks
[2:38:53] <%bettysharkface> Please don't jinx Keanu like this Plague
[2:38:54] <2Sam4Hall> But you're entertaining plague...
[2:38:54] <+PleasantLee> I like rurouni kenshin....but I cant wear my kenshin tshirt no more!
[2:38:55] <+BubbaRands> Keanu has done nothing wrong...yet...
[2:38:58] <Livelinne> Need more reptiles in AC
[2:39:02] <mortelkilll> if you only want to follow good people, you ll follwo no one
[2:39:03] <%Samex_Comex> I listen to a lot of metal and rock
[2:39:05] <%thedamnchaos1> smart man
[2:39:18] <ChattyWhacker> I must admit, that's a saxy mouse
[2:39:25] <Brandon_Weavers> All entertainer's have fucked up things going on, it's what makes them talented alot of the time
[2:39:30] <theenigmaticdude> From working in retail and listening to a lot of music, you realize a lot of love songs are messed up.
[2:39:31] <voltvexen> I bought Rorouni Kenshin before I heard about the creator
[2:39:31] <+stinkomeanie> That goes for everything made by man, not just art.
[2:39:33] <+Scevda> Keanu is probably into kinky shit. Hell he may be here. RIGHT NOW.
[2:39:44] <mortelkilll> love sogns are pretty messed up
[2:39:46] <SilverRoddo> plagueImoya_BN
[2:39:46] <Miikaaeeel> what do you mean stupid

[2:41:08] <Livelinne> Chibimaruko chan

[2:41:25] <mortelkilll> i like beauty underneath from the phanto mof the opera sequel, its a great song but the phantom motive in the song is horrible, its a vilain song that doesnt know its a vilain song
[2:41:30] <%Samex_Comex> She has little dot eyes
[2:41:33] <@DCN2049> https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KlxFARJQf30
[2:41:44] <ChattyWhacker> I am only fond of the young children from the Katamari Damacy soundtrack
[2:41:48] <+PleasantLee> okay this does look adorable
[2:41:56] <+PleasantLee> rule 34 must NOT be made
[2:41:57] <Brandon_Weavers> Plague, as superior boomer, what hidden gems of anime would you recommend to a feeble millenial such as myself
[2:42:00] <tubit> LUL
[2:42:06] <+stinkomeanie> “Anime was a mistake” - Plague
[2:42:08] <%Samex_Comex> Back when it was cute and not creepy
[2:42:09] <+PleasantLee> god this song is infectious as fuck
[2:42:09] <Livelinne> Lyrics by manga author herself
[2:42:11] <Shardlab> Oh, before anime started laser focusing 50% of their output on otaku
[2:42:13] <shameimarusen> enbClap
[2:42:16] <mortelkilll> isnt plague more of a xoomer?
[2:42:21] <henshin2289> Oh. I came at a bad time.
[2:42:37] <%bettysharkface> It reminds me a little of the opening for Steel Angel Kurumi, which is...not as innocent
[2:42:37] <ChattyWhacker> doki doki?
[2:42:39] <mortelkilll> peopel seem to alway forget there 2 generations between boomers and zoomers
[2:42:40] <theloganbrand> I'm more of a Little Lulu prtdon then Maruko-chan
[2:42:46] <Livelinne> It’s a mixture of her childhood memories?
[2:42:51] <kingjx1> good song
[2:42:56] <tubit> It had the right amount of silly
[2:42:58] <Brandon_Weavers> Is a xoomer a extreme zoomer?
[2:43:06] <BabyNaBackbrace> @mortelkilll don't bother arguing the label, "boomer" is anyone older than the person using it
[2:43:08] <MrHappyFunshine> it sounds like she is singing banana and it makes me dislike it
[2:43:19] <%Samex_Comex> Aw we gangsta now
[2:43:47] <voltvexen> I didn't know white folks like this music lol
[2:43:50] <carsnova> Funky ganstas
[2:44:00] <mortelkilll> whtie folk like a lot of black music funny enough
[2:44:01] <+BubbaRands> And this is part where Plague proves he's blacker than Woolie LUL
[2:44:20] <MrHappyFunshine> this type of music is my childhood
[2:44:27] <%Samex_Comex> I like Heavy D
[2:44:40] <+BubbaRands> This makes me wanna barbeque LUL
[2:44:52] <mortelkilll> is that whats called funk?
[2:44:54] <+Scevda> “Theres a party going on in my pants”
[2:45:03] <+Scevda> “You are not wearing pants”
[2:45:05] <+PleasantLee> did some one say September?
[2:45:06] <+stinkomeanie> She said this music makes her want to make salsa
[2:45:10] <+Scevda> “I know”
[2:45:40] <%CaptHat211> Funk has always been a personal favorite genre.
[2:45:45] <MrHappyFunshine> this is music to groove to
[2:46:01] <mortelkilll> my father right between boomers and gen x and im right between gen y and z
[2:46:15] <+EySoyCoco> nice jam woolieMIRIN
[2:46:25] <mortelkilll> i think we both took more after our later generation respectively
[2:46:29] <+stinkomeanie> Plague you ever heard of The Internet?
[2:46:48] <carsnova> This is such a relaxed stream
[2:47:00] <MrHappyFunshine> psychedelic rock is my favourite genre but funk is close
[2:47:12] <london_flexing> !uptime
[2:47:13] <@Nightbot> 2 hours 47 minutes 22 seconds
[2:47:16] <mortelkilll> i wonder if peopel how peopel are gonna call gen alpha when they want to complain about them
[2:47:26] <%thedamnchaos1> plagueImoya_SG
[2:47:31] <mortelkilll> these darn alphoomers
[2:47:36] <%CaptHat211> You can check stocks on there
[2:47:36] <+PleasantLee> holograms
[2:47:50] <+PleasantLee> no ones on top forever
[2:47:55] <+Sgthor> Real sh*t here finoCryme
[2:47:57] <%nerdbayne> probably be doing trap music
[2:48:02] <DehiDehi> KKona
[2:48:04] <DehiDehi> rap
[2:48:21] <+PleasantLee> this is why Ice T is the best, he's timeless
[2:48:25] <+stinkomeanie> The Internet is good if you’re into a modern funk and r&b.
[2:48:29] <%CaptHat211> What are your thoughts on the Beastie Boys?
[2:48:35] <theloganbrand> Tupac would have played cousin it in the adams family instead
[2:48:38] <MrHappyFunshine> This is some good shit
[2:48:39] <mortelkilll> i guess i like the rythm of these kind of songs
[2:48:45] <mortelkilll> but they get a bit repeptitive
[2:48:49] <+BubbaRands> I can see the "thug lyfe" tattoo edits already LUL
[2:49:10] <+Scevda> Beastie boys are very shouty.
[2:49:18] <+PleasantLee> if only we liked beastie boys a 10th as much as jj abrams does
[2:49:21] <mortelkilll> cant really imagine them elsewhere than really calm hub area
[2:49:26] <MrHappyFunshine> a shame, beastie boys were great
[2:49:30] <%bettysharkface> I know some Beastie Boy types if you're open for another song request.
[2:49:49] <MrHappyFunshine> they usually made me think about fatboy slim as well
[2:50:37] <%CaptHat211> Yawn
[2:50:59] <SilverRoddo> Yanni
[2:51:04] <+PleasantLee> I need more "real" music in my music folder, 90% anime/games osts
[2:51:33] <+BubbaRands> "real" is subjective
[2:51:43] <tubit> that disco panning
[2:51:46] <+PleasantLee> yeah, but if I'm ever entertaining guests....oh dear
[2:51:54] <carsnova> Ooo I like this already
[2:51:55] <+stinkomeanie> Fuck yeah yung bae
[2:51:58] <Huntercd> !uptime
[2:51:58] <@Nightbot> 2 hours 52 minutes 8 seconds
[2:52:05] <+stinkomeanie> Or Macross 86 99
[2:52:10] <%nerdbayne> im digging it
[2:52:11] <+PleasantLee> wheres bae city rollaz at?
[2:52:17] <MrHappyFunshine> i mostly listen to vidya music due to it having more of an emotional impact
[2:52:22] <Huntercd> Damn you Twitch
[2:52:25] <+stinkomeanie> Is this Macross or Yung Bae?
[2:52:52] <%bettysharkface> https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K3tio5xPxmQ To be fair, only song of theirs I listen to, haven't heard any of the other stuff, this one just reminds me of the Beastie Boys.
[2:52:59] <%nerdbayne> i do like disco and vintage funk
[2:53:01] <+Sgthor> City Pop, Vaporwave are quite groovy SourPls
[2:53:14] <MrHappyFunshine> This is sone smoking sexy style music
[2:53:34] <%bettysharkface> Yaaaay
[2:53:34] <DehiDehi> ohno
[2:53:36] <+PleasantLee> me! me! me!
[2:53:38] <+stinkomeanie> Great disco funk from Macross, Yung Bae is great to and they work together a lot.
[2:53:54] <DehiDehi> put on your trenchcoats
[2:54:06] <+stinkomeanie> Slayer?
[2:54:10] <%CaptHat211> Here we go...
[2:54:14] <%bettysharkface> It is barely audible to mine ancient live concert ravaged ears.
[2:54:15] <%Samex_Comex> Aw yeah let's wrestle in the backyard and smash shit!!
[2:54:19] <MrHappyFunshine> it is too hot for my trench coat
[2:54:19] <+Sgthor> This is something Aggretsuko would scream too
[2:54:20] <tubit> Some kind of 90's thrash
[2:54:30] <+Scevda> Seems alright just not mixed well.
[2:54:45] <+PleasantLee> this is a song someone hears and says "they're just playing the same thing over and over" and someone else says "yeah, its great"
[2:54:54] <MrHappyFunshine> Ham? is he shouting ham?
[2:54:55] <+stinkomeanie> Oof
[2:55:07] <%bettysharkface> I got some bad audio processing, so live music may as well me in simlish for me
[2:55:08] <+stinkomeanie> Metallica acoustic is amazing though
[2:55:08] <DehiDehi> oh
[2:55:09] <carsnova> This playlist is so crazy, Bluegrass Float On, creepy 80s pop, disco funk and then 90s thrash
[2:55:16] <DehiDehi> yes it cant be the same song
[2:55:18] <DehiDehi> wow
[2:55:31] <+Scevda> You can actually hear top end notes
[2:55:43] <%CaptHat211> Its like a Dragonforce situation?
[2:55:43] <+stinkomeanie> Master of puppets in acoustics is really good.
[2:55:44] <tubit> They put that terrible compression on all the metal songs in the 90's. Makes a lot of them sound terrible, imo
[2:56:02] <DehiDehi> this is the kind of music you listen with your windows open to make a statement
[2:56:06] <+uncleslumlord> Twitch just wouldn't let me chat for a while wtf
[2:56:08] <DehiDehi> to your terrified christian neighbouts
[2:56:09] <+Scevda> Mmm ham!
[2:56:10] <mortelkilll> honestly a lot of groups are worse live, you just cant hear the lyrics over the music
[2:56:12] <MrHappyFunshine> he still sounds like he is shouting ham
[2:56:13] <%Samex_Comex> Sounds like Rob/white Zombie?
[2:56:19] <Melchior_the_Wise> After the black album it just went down hill
[2:56:20] <+PleasantLee> ahahah, just googled Ice T and he's selling his car over twitter
[2:56:30] <+Scevda> What neighbors? The live 3 miles away
[2:56:44] <%bettysharkface> Most of the time I struggle to hear people right in front of me if I can't see their lips, it's a good time. Meanwhile I can hear dogs barking two blocks away. Audio processing issues is a good time full of surprises.
[2:56:45] <%Samex_Comex> I was rocking out
[2:56:53] <%CaptHat211> @dehidehi Did someone say Christian? *waves*
[2:57:00] <DehiDehi> HeyGuys
[2:57:00] <mortelkilll> hi
[2:57:28] <MrHappyFunshine> jesus betty, get some hearing aids lass
[2:57:38] <%Samex_Comex> Old lady
[2:57:39] <%bettysharkface> They wouldn't help, it's the brain
[2:57:45] <%bettysharkface> The brain is the issue
[2:57:47] <+Scevda> I would love a Plague take on what Brandy looks like.
[2:57:47] <MrHappyFunshine> fuck...
[2:57:55] <Livelinne> Listen Skunk Anansie or Shiina Ringo if you want a good live performance
[2:57:55] <%bettysharkface> I hear everything
[2:57:56] <+Sgthor> Just get a new brain 4Head
[2:57:57] <MrHappyFunshine> that sucks
[2:58:01] <tubit> Yeah, I got that. I call it 'selective hearing' LUL
[2:58:02] <%bettysharkface> That's why I can't hear
[2:58:02] <+PleasantLee> trying listening to pink noise, helps me sometimes
[2:58:05] <%Samex_Comex> Braining aids?
[2:58:07] <%CaptHat211> Brandy, you need to move on.
[2:58:20] <Melchior_the_Wise> Is Brandy a simp?
[2:58:25] <Livelinne> Also Susumu Hirasawa
[2:58:26] <SilverRoddo> Brandy from Hamtaro
[2:58:38] <%bettysharkface> Too many noises happening at once makes my brain say, you know what, you can't hear shit.
[2:58:52] <Livelinne> feet 🐁
[2:59:09] <SilverRoddo> bitterGasm
[2:59:11] <%bettysharkface> NotLikeThis Yeah bud. Feet.
[2:59:21] <DehiDehi> did i hear feet @Livelinne
[2:59:28] <%CaptHat211> There’s plenty of fish in the sea, Brandy.

[3:00:02] <BombchuGuy> Kreygasm

[3:00:11] <+Scevda> Brandy just got shot down like guys do “Sorry I have to wash my hair” = “Sorry I just love the sea too much”.
[3:00:20] <+stinkomeanie> My cilantro and thyme plants are dying. I feel terrible BibleThump
[3:00:22] <%Samex_Comex> There is a whole gang of them
[3:00:37] <DehiDehi> @stinkomeanie calling the police on you
[3:00:39] <WizardofWazz> wooliePOYO
[3:00:45] <+PleasantLee> this sounds like a cover of video killed the radio star that I like
[3:00:45] <@DCN2049> Do we need heavy moderation
[3:00:52] <mortelkilll> :(
[3:00:58] <%bettysharkface> Anyway it's like 2:31AM, I got a big day of not getting to go anywhere for my birthday, so I'm gonna fall asleep to Plague hollering and genre whiplash. Night night.

[3:03:53] <+Scevda> Implicative Cans!
[3:04:19] <+PleasantLee> that was live?
[3:04:24] <+PleasantLee> didnt hear a peep
[3:04:31] <carsnova> A little too much vacation juice
[3:04:47] <%Samex_Comex> Cheese flavored beer
[3:04:52] <%CaptHat211> What is w/ the juice talk?
[3:05:03] <+JesterInsultsTheWorld> NGL, that soda tab looks like the spongebob character Plankton with a handlebar moustache and it's got me all kinds of giggling
[3:05:04] <SilverRoddo> Laura Brannigan ?
[3:05:08] <+PleasantLee> usually cant stand live music, but sometimes it has a good energy behind it
[3:05:17] <conchubar11> ahhhh, good times listening to Fleetwood Mac man
[3:05:20] <MrHappyFunshine> guess it was a song that people were to preoccupied with hugging the person next them and hding lighters in the air
[3:05:39] <+Scevda> Depends on the artist genre for me @pleasantlee
[3:05:48] <+stinkomeanie> Sounds like Emylou Harris
[3:06:26] <MrHappyFunshine> i've only been to a few concerts and never again, it ain't ny bag
[3:06:47] <MrHappyFunshine> great burger vans though
[3:06:57] <carsnova> I feel like I would enjoy concerts more if they weren't so dang expensive
[3:07:34] <%Samex_Comex> Ik Leef Niet Meer Voor Jou is cool live
[3:07:54] <MrHappyFunshine> they never used to be, they really jacjed up the prices from my childhood
[3:08:10] <carsnova> That sucks
[3:08:11] <Livelinne> I miss those rave parties, but I’m not young enough to do an all-nighter caddyRIP
[3:08:27] <+stinkomeanie> Worst concert I went to was Circa Survive. The band was fine, but all the female fans could not contain singing along with the song so loud it was overtaking the band’s sound.
[3:08:46] <@Nightbot> Plague is a youtube animator and also streams at https://picarto.tv/Plague . Also: t-shirts! http://goo.gl/lze8QO
[3:09:05] <MrHappyFunshine> hell my dad has a mug with all the concerts he went printed on them, £5 to see Bowie live front row
[3:09:31] <carsnova> Oh wow
[3:09:39] <MrHappyFunshine> shit was wild back in my dads day
[3:09:43] <carsnova> That must've been a concert and a half
[3:10:06] <conchubar11> Mac's actually one of the good old bands I can still go see. Can't even go see Rush now
[3:10:21] <%Samex_Comex> I'm getting pumped!
[3:10:39] <+PleasantLee> that brian blessed?
[3:11:01] <MrHappyFunshine> Brian Blessed is a good boi
[3:11:09] <fanzkafka> cute rat
[3:11:28] <%tokenreefer> shes really evolved since last time
[3:11:43] <+stinkomeanie> Yajirobe Yajirobe Yajirobe 🎶
[3:11:47] <%Samex_Comex> How do you eat Oreos
[3:11:54] <MrHappyFunshine> OREO-OREO-OREO
[3:12:07] <Livelinne> bite
[3:12:19] <%tokenreefer> what oreos do you prefer?
[3:12:27] <Livelinne> Or dip-n-bite
[3:12:49] <carsnova> People who take oreos apart remind me of people who bite kitkats without snaping them off
[3:12:50] <%Samex_Comex> The Halloween ones
[3:12:55] <+BubbaRands> bite-n-dip?
[3:13:13] <Daxalog> I like the mint ones
[3:13:14] <MrHappyFunshine> i eat oreos by twisting then using my tongue like a suction cup to remove the cream completely intact then eat the biscuit
[3:13:16] <+PleasantLee> I found some gluten free oreos last week, not too bad
[3:13:23] <AncelDeLambert> oreos are horrendous
[3:13:41] <%CaptHat211> Blasphemy!
[3:13:42] <Livelinne> My place doesn’t have too much orero selections...
[3:13:46] <+stinkomeanie> Plague is a Chipsahoy slut
[3:14:07] <%tokenreefer> i went through an oreo phase in my late teens.
[3:14:31] <carsnova> The classic teenage oreo phase
[3:14:33] <+Draylle> I generally feel like shit after eating anything heavy with sugar
[3:14:46] <+bear_breaker20> you should open with that when dating @tokenreefer
[3:14:51] <+BubbaRands> Im still going through that phase and im almost 30
[3:14:59] <+bear_breaker20> its a good line
[3:15:03] <%tokenreefer> im not big on candy but sometimes when im in a deep depression io cant get enough
[3:15:18] <+Cook_4_Souls> ahh good DBS soundtrack. When they actually put effort into it
[3:15:34] <%CaptHat211> All joking aside I’ve abolished most sugar out of my life. I can’t really stomach most candy anymore.
[3:15:37] <MrHappyFunshine> i tend to just have energy drinks
[3:15:51] <%tokenreefer> @bear_breaker20, @bubbarands tinder here i come
[3:15:54] <carsnova> Candy to me has always been a "feel slightly better now" "feel awful 10 minutes later" thing
[3:16:17] <voltvexen> im addicted to candy
[3:16:35] <tubit> bryan adams o.O
[3:16:38] <theloganbrand> nice
[3:16:41] <+bear_breaker20> lmfao this song nooooo
[3:16:49] <+stinkomeanie> Play more songs about girls being under 18
[3:16:56] <%bettysharkface> Coming back into chat to call Plague a dirty bastard, but also you think she'd wear frlly stuff?
[3:16:57] <%CaptHat211> Ah yeah
[3:16:59] <%Samex_Comex> This plays on the radio a lot
[3:17:13] <%tokenreefer> always regret it. I have to intermittent fast to maintain weight lol
[3:17:14] <carsnova> This is a classic dad song
[3:17:29] <theenigmaticdude> First song l remember hearing as a kid
[3:17:37] <%CaptHat211> Those were the best days of my life
[3:18:06] <Murphio_GS> Summer of 69?
[3:18:35] <%tokenreefer> I always imagine the time period and how the landscape and attitude effected how you listen to music
[3:18:57] <theenigmaticdude> My dad use to play the hell out of his Bryan Adams tape
[3:19:10] <%Samex_Comex> Now I'm thinking about my summers in Highschool :(
[3:19:18] <AncelDeLambert> yo I love hearing guys singing about how they peaked in high school
[3:19:25] <+PleasantLee> and how awful they were?
[3:19:45] <%bettysharkface> Pfft
[3:19:48] <MrHappyFunshine> Dirty little rat

[3:20:27] <+BubbaRands> Why Plague?!? BibleThump
[3:20:33] <+Jumpie8> same
[3:20:33] <%bettysharkface> Ignorance is bliss, or something
[3:20:33] <MortalSandWitch> I mean being a teenager IS the process of becoming a person right?
[3:20:41] <+PleasantLee> I do wish that I could go back to those times
[3:20:41] <2Sam4Hall> Is depression a personality?
[3:20:45] <%tokenreefer> the wieght of responsibility as a adult.
[3:20:47] <+stinkomeanie> Did someone steal my dad’s cassette collection and gave them to Plague?
[3:20:50] <theenigmaticdude> l hated highschool
[3:20:50] <+PleasantLee> just so I didnt fuckign waste all that time like I did
[3:21:03] <+stinkomeanie> Freaking Boys2Men shubbaLaugh
[3:21:05] <tubit> I feel pressured to have a personality
[3:21:06] <MrHappyFunshine> aren't you supposed to be sleeping madam?
[3:21:07] <%Samex_Comex> For like a week like a vacation
[3:21:14] <%tokenreefer> i hated highschool and early adult life. things are just now decernt
[3:21:18] <+BubbaRands> My Boyz II Men BibleThump
[3:21:27] <voltvexen> I was awkward and forced to do too many things I couldn't care to do

[3:30:18] <%tokenreefer> i remember hearing this on "now thats what i call the 80's music cd commercials
[3:30:36] <SuperVaderMan> I appreciate this plague rat, by plague
[3:30:38] <carsnova> Those cds were something else
[3:30:56] <+BubbaRands> Disturbed debuted a new song, a sequel to "Down with the Sickness" called "Wear a mask to Avoid the Sickness"
[3:31:08] <AncelDeLambert> ...okay, that's funny
[3:31:09] <%tokenreefer> every single commercial. i learned to like the songs via osmosis
[3:32:02] <carsnova> Whenever i hear the same commercial I cant help but sing along even if i've only ever heard the 4 seconds in the commercial
[3:32:47] <%CaptHat211> This sounds like music used for vacation commercials. “Sandals...”
[3:32:51] <%tokenreefer> exactly. those are the little things i miss in the post cable world
[3:34:30] <tubit> i like the strings
[3:34:37] <Huntercd> sploosh

[3:58:57] <+stinkomeanie> Potato salad shubbaWhat
[3:59:08] <+PleasantLee> never heard someone being so surprised by their own hunger
[3:59:12] <Firemane1279> additional food required.
[3:59:16] <%thedamnchaos1> *Taco Salad
[3:59:24] <Murphio_GS> Same
[3:59:28] <+stinkomeanie> I'm more of a egg salad guy
[3:59:33] <%JJCheeker> Do you put eggs in it
[3:59:35] <carsnova> I've got stuff I gotta do, thanks for such a chill stream
[3:59:40] <+BubbaRands> Mustard or no mustard?
[3:59:47] <%Samex_Comex> "They got sand in the potato salad!"
[3:59:48] <+Scevda> Mayo is pretty bad overall ino
[4:00:17] <%CaptHat211> I’ve never liked egg salad
[4:00:20] <+stinkomeanie> Man, filtering out porn subreddits on Reddit is a lot of work
[4:02:10] <+PleasantLee> we watching conan tonight?
[4:02:14] <%Samex_Comex> Conan
[4:02:23] <+jorgamund> love this song. the remastered soundtrack is even better
[4:02:28] <%Samex_Comex> Chrom!
[4:02:33] <+Scevda> Hell yeah
[4:03:15] <+PleasantLee> love this part
[4:03:40] <%Samex_Comex> Uh oh
[4:03:42] <+jorgamund> sorry, not remastered, re-recorded. With actual anvils and chains and such
[4:03:59] <+PleasantLee> when are we gonna get conan the conqueror
[4:04:00] <SilverRoddo> Is there toe-wrestling?
[4:06:01] <+jorgamund> come on... Terminator, fine, but Arnold can't pull off Conan again
[4:06:09] <+Scevda> Son of Conan?
[4:06:28] <%Samex_Comex> Mako is fun in Battle creek brawl he beats Jackie Chan with a cane and then gets it with a big lady
[4:06:48] <+PleasantLee> just a movie about old conan, coming to grips with his life in its golden years. and then he fights the gods of the apocalypse and loses, the end
[4:07:12] <+stinkomeanie> See destruction, war, and pillaging done by Conan. "Tell me more of your strange ways" - Women in that universe
[4:07:29] <+jorgamund> an Old Man Conan would be a fantastic short story, but a terrible action/adventure movie
[4:07:34] <YakumoYomi> "What is best in life?"
[4:07:55] <+PleasantLee> I watched that cut scene of conan and subotai talking about spring a little while go
[4:07:55] <joanna9700> Old man Conan should be a mentor figure
[4:08:28] <SilverRoddo> You can make Conan gaslight the main character, like that old sheriff ranger in New Vegas
[4:08:49] <YakumoYomi> I have fond memories of watching Conan the Destroyer as a child.

[4:11:49] <SilverRoddo> Chrona Trigger
[4:12:32] <+Vestillion> what is it about sleep deprivation that makes me able to work sliiiiiightly better?
[4:12:52] <+stinkomeanie> Plague do you stream art more at Picarto than here?
[4:13:04] <%thedamnchaos1> I would imagine maintaining and keeping track of layers would be a nightmare
[4:13:08] <+jorgamund> @Vestillion the low level desperation. Same with a deadline, or when you need to pee
[4:13:30] <SilverRoddo> Sleep deprivation has the feel of a deadline?
[4:14:20] <%tokenreefer> Chonic Trigger
[4:14:58] <+jorgamund> no, it makes you feel desperate to sleep, and (for some people) that feeling of urgency makes you work better. A deadline makes you feel urgency too.
[4:14:58] <+stinkomeanie> This has been perfect to study to
[4:15:18] <+stinkomeanie> Working with a sense of urgency is important
[4:16:05] <SilverRoddo> 🐜
[4:16:14] <Seatherten> i liked it better from the other side
[4:16:50] <+stinkomeanie> Plague I'm considering living in the mountain as a hermit
[4:17:05] <%JJCheeker> Living in or on
[4:17:13] <+stinkomeanie> on the mountain
[4:17:15] <+stinkomeanie> in a home
[4:17:16] <+jorgamund> Plague, you've talked about the importance of flipping your images while drawing, but for ones like this do you start out with a definite way you want it to face?
[4:17:18] <+Vestillion> I've... I've heard a remix of this track
[4:17:18] <ReNhoSoft1> With no internet?
[4:17:18] <+stinkomeanie> with animals and shit
[4:17:25] <%JJCheeker> Sounds exciting
[4:18:05] <%Samex_Comex> It's a adventure through drawing
[4:18:12] <Greedboyz> Plague is making lewd animals again huh? atpCap
[4:18:24] <+Binary_Fireball> Do you remember Murray the skull? I would love a lewd of Murray the demonic skull
[4:18:25] <+stinkomeanie> I wanna raise chickens and 1 cow, a couple dogs
[4:18:26] <Melchior_the_Wise> When does he not?
[4:18:58] <+stinkomeanie> She's just chilling

[4:19:34] <Melchior_the_Wise> Is this an AC character?
[4:19:36] <+PleasantLee> how dare see allow herself to be drawn without a burke on
[4:19:48] <%tokenreefer> shes looking at me seductive... any eye contact makes me flustered
[4:20:02] <+Scevda> Same @tokenreefer
[4:20:08] <SilverRoddo> I hear mice are ticklish.
[4:20:11] <YakumoYomi> Please don't remind me of snake women. I'm still disappointed that Patty Cakes's stream on Friday left my thirst utterly unquenched.
[4:20:13] <+stinkomeanie> How is the Xcom by the way?
[4:20:23] <+stinkomeanie> I heard it was only like $10
[4:20:43] <SuperVaderMan> Love me some chill juice
[4:20:52] <+Binary_Fireball> Patty snek Patty snek XCOM bug what does it take to make snek...

[4:21:10] <+BubbaRands> to be real!
[4:21:32] <+bear_breaker20> could go for a chill juice...
[4:21:41] <Livelinne> Mmm Chill Juice DrinkPurple
[4:21:45] <%thedamnchaos1> xcom 2 is actually free for few hours if you use steam.
[4:21:48] <%JJCheeker> What about chili juice
[4:22:09] <+bear_breaker20> chili juice (no meats) sounds disgusting
[4:22:11] <joanna9700> Why exactly did an XCOM game get taken over by scalies?
[4:22:30] <Livelinne> LUL
[4:22:37] <+stinkomeanie> -1 Nickleback

[4:22:47] <+Scevda> Harkness Juice
[4:23:02] <+stinkomeanie> Harkness would be selling milk
[4:23:11] <AncelDeLambert> are you full of determination?
[4:23:22] <Melchior_the_Wise> probably my favorite undertale track, but I need that intro .
[4:23:22] <+stinkomeanie> oh I didn't like the mental image i just projected in my head
[4:25:20] <%Samex_Comex> samexcYoucandoit
[4:25:56] <+bear_breaker20> just throw garbage on the rats walls
[4:25:58] <Melchior_the_Wise> Just love how funky it all is
[4:26:30] <+stinkomeanie> They use to play this song at my last job
[4:27:05] <+BubbaRands> Is it weird that I want to go to a Roller rink right now? LUL
[4:27:15] <+Comtrya> did you work at a roller rink?
[4:27:24] <+BubbaRands> NO
[4:27:24] <+stinkomeanie> Social distancing in a roller rink would be great actually
[4:27:49] <+jorgamund> until the inevitable pileup after one person slips
[4:27:55] <+PleasantLee> fuck me its already 26th april
[4:28:51] <joanna9700> what you mean? It's not January still?

[4:35:57] <derangedhobo_> 2004

[4:36:56] <%Samex_Comex> Damn I was 13
[4:36:59] <turbofolk> figures it has that distinc feel of late 90'
[4:37:20] <turbofolk> early 00's style
[4:38:38] <+BubbaRands> Remember the early 2000's when it was just 90's : Part 2?
[4:38:40] <+joszanarky> damn son
[4:38:54] <voltvexen> nope I was just born
[4:39:18] <zamzoph> This isn't a DS9 stream...
[4:40:32] <derangedhobo_> Right before tracks got a bit too much production and became a bit too messy, imo ofc.
[4:41:09] <+Scevda> 14 kids? Hey have you heard of this amazing invention called the condom?
[4:41:31] <+Vestillion> man's just TOO potent for any earthly condom to contain
[4:42:16] <%Samex_Comex> Shit I thought the whispering was coming from my room!
[4:42:17] <+BubbaRands> The stream alone just breaks the condom

[4:44:44] <+jorgamund> ever heard the original version they had of this song, before they made it faster? it sounds weird after getting used to this one
[4:44:48] <Livelinne> 3 dudes jogging one is my favorite
[4:44:53] <+Scevda> Going through some very heavy set braces work.
[4:44:54] <turbofolk> Wasn't there a dark souls parody with this exact song?
[4:45:06] <%JJCheeker> yeah
[4:45:07] <Handsome0ne> Plague has an amazing music taste so far to be honest
[4:45:16] <SpookyBeef7> Yep, was made by an Italian video maker.
[4:45:26] <SpookyBeef7> Forget his username.
[4:45:29] <YakumoYomi> For a year or twoooo!

[4:59:55] <Melchior_the_Wise> Did I just see her wink at me?
[5:00:03] <+Vestillion> It's a healthy mix of hip-hop and R&D.
[5:00:46] <+BubbaRands> @JJCheeker you say it as if its a bad thinh
[5:00:55] <$Livelinne> SeemsGood100 seriously how did you practiced the sense of shadow/lightning? *a cry from pseudo artist
[5:00:55] <%JJCheeker> I'm having a dance party over here
[5:03:25] <%thedamnchaos1> !uptime
[5:03:25] <@Nightbot> 5 hours 3 minutes 35 seconds
[5:03:39] <+stinkomeanie> Weird question but can anyone recommend a desk chair? Tired of using a yoga ball
[5:03:40] <ahaegotrigger> plagues taste in music is so smooth
[5:04:39] <%JJCheeker> Good variety
[5:04:51] <$Livelinne> @stinkomeanie All I can say is you MUST try at store(which is not easy in these days I know)
[5:05:12] <+stinkomeanie> Got a good suggestion for a store?
[5:05:18] <+stinkomeanie> @Livelinne
[5:06:12] <%Samex_Comex> Looks like her fur got ripped off or something on the game model
[5:06:21] <+Scevda> Ouch
[5:06:44] <$Livelinne> @stinkomeanie Honestly I don’t know where u are living, but I usually go to hyper markets office section, or seek for local furniture store
[5:07:25] <%JJCheeker> Looks like a nice day out
[5:07:36] <+stinkomeanie> It's hard to shop for one, there's no middle of the road brand for a decent chair. They are either cheap and terrible or over $400
[5:07:41] <%JJCheeker> Too bad there's nothing and nowhere to go
[5:08:30] <%thedamnchaos1> This slaps
[5:08:35] <DehiDehi> it do

[5:08:50] <+stinkomeanie> 50 cent got some good jams
[5:08:51] <$Livelinne> @stinkomeanie My last advice is, once you tried and like it, then don’t hesitate to pay the price
[5:09:20] <+stinkomeanie> appreciate it @Livelinne

[5:23:38] <conchubar11> but which are dumber, sheep or goats
[5:23:52] <+bear_breaker20> depends if the goats like hell
[5:23:52] <%JJCheeker> Goats are the Devil
[5:24:03] <Firemane1279> Trick question. Both are equally as dumb. LUL
[5:24:21] <conchubar11> Luvuwu bites OwO
[5:24:36] <YakumoYomi> Sheep seem less...annoying than goats, though.
[5:24:54] <%JJCheeker> Goats can kill
[5:25:24] <+bear_breaker20> gaot milk is good tho dont be mad at animals D:

[5:47:28] <mortelkilll> only thing abotu this song thats kind of annoying is how it feel like its cosntantly stopping
[5:47:31] <+Vestillion> I know this, but for the life of me I couldn't name it.
[5:47:33] <lewdandindebt> Whats this song?
[5:47:35] <Treuan> Ron White's hit single: I stuck my pecker in a toaster
[5:47:47] <+Scevda> Ya the stopping is not great.
[5:47:52] <mortelkilll> ultimate battle fro mdragonball
[5:47:55] <$Livelinne> Mizuki Ichiro?
[5:48:14] <mortelkilll> i like how its just super intense most of the time and then, stop and start again
[5:49:02] <mortelkilll> the signer really is the best part
[5:49:08] <mortelkilll> singer
[5:49:10] <+Scevda> It kind of invokes a unprofessional feeling like they couldn’t pay for an editor to cut each song part together correctly.
[5:49:18] <Treuan> Imagine this song in sign
[5:49:28] <%Samex_Comex> you can do it frieza
[5:49:56] <ZanRebel> damn it, i knew this song, what was it from ??
[5:49:59] <mortelkilll> kidn of getting a feel that the singer exxagerate soem of the pronounciation for impact
[5:50:14] <$Livelinne> JANJAN BYANBYAN
[5:50:30] <TardigradeRex> @mortelkilll Isn't that what singing is all about? :D
[5:50:32] <ZanRebel> reminds me of Bang Shishigami's theme song from Blazblue LUL

[5:52:24] <YakumoYomi> Past*, rather\
[5:52:24] <ZanRebel> Attack on Titan had a great English version
[5:52:33] <HyperBomb21> Dragonball is also the only anime that gets this treatment nowadays. Other shows still have their japanese OPs
[5:52:36] <mortelkilll> i get that english words wouldnt have the same impact but even then they could have tryed
[5:52:39] <$Livelinne> woolieCHAN
[5:52:39] <+Scevda> Ass sounds better than that. At least I want to eat as.
[5:52:42] <+stinkomeanie> Let's go win that karate tournament and win the prize money to save the orphanage's rec center!
[5:52:43] <Murphio_GS> Attack on Titan's first op is really great still
[5:53:01] <+reidpeedhisbed> @ahaegotrigger lol
[5:53:12] <HyperBomb21> Fitting then that Attack on Titans last ED is also really amazing

[6:07:30] <KessOrangeSoda> weed is now the same kind of industry as small batch craft beer
[6:07:36] <+stinkomeanie> Don't be posh, we should be enjoying weed like the Greeks enjoyed wine. There would be no war
[6:07:37] <GoopyEuclid> It doesn’t help there’s so many goddamn cross breeds now
[6:07:48] <+Vestillion> Ah
