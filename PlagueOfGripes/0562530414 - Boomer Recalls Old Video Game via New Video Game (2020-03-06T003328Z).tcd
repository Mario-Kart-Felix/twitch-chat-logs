[0:06:10] <%KellBeII> @jetnjenkins Hype
[0:06:11] <%JantDarvus> So Plague, did you see that delightful Kotaku tweet on the boss fight in this demo?
[0:06:13] <+thereisneverenoughdakka> PRAISE FOR THE DEGENERACY SPREADS
[0:06:29] <%Devsteps> thanks jetnjenkins
[0:06:32] <%Deimos002> Holy crap, thanks @jetnjenkins enbKiss
[0:06:34] <Ipsenscastle> Goes a lot faster if you run Barrett for the boss and just build his ATB over and over for magic
[0:06:45] <+Cucamabungabu> @PlagueOfGripes would you fuck cloud or biggs?
[0:06:46] <+thereisneverenoughdakka> @PlagueOfGripes Hi Plague, this mote of scum and degeneracy greets you and inquires as to your current well being
[0:06:47] <@Nightbot> Plague is a youtube animator and also streams at https://picarto.tv/Plague . Also: t-shirts! http://goo.gl/lze8QO
[0:06:51] <mathomertiolato> it is!
[0:07:22] <professorno> Which FF game has the hottest cast?
[0:07:47] <%KellBeII> Biggs would buy you something after
[0:07:49] <Ipsenscastle> Cloud would just lie there
[0:08:06] <+TaylOctopus91> !uptime
[0:08:06] <@Nightbot> 8 minutes 15 seconds
[0:08:15] <+Cucamabungabu> cloud would probably rip a super loud fart and sex would be awkward after that.
[0:08:23] <+thereisneverenoughdakka> Laser fetish dialogue?
[0:08:52] <Mizaiya> I wonder if you can backwards boost
[0:09:20] <+thereisneverenoughdakka> oh christ
[0:09:24] <+thereisneverenoughdakka> 11 minutes
[0:09:27] <%KellBeII> nightmare animation
[0:09:46] <+Cucamabungabu> @PlagueOfGripes Can you give your thoughts on the last chapter of beastars without spoiling anything? I personally really hated a certain promise.
[0:10:11] <+thereisneverenoughdakka> Excuse me what
[0:10:31] <Mizaiya> I hate the idea of making one mistake and having to restart
[0:11:10] <smile64> steiner is peak masculine charm
[0:11:37] <+Noelle_of_the_Nova> What about FF14?
[0:11:47] <Mizaiya> Id say 12
[0:11:56] <Mizaiya> but thats just cause bunny ladies
[0:11:59] <Masterchiefaron> Cheer1 Cheer1 Cheer1 Cheer1 Cheer1 Cheer1 Cheer1 Cheer1 Cheer1 Cheer1 Cheer1 Cheer1 Cheer1 Cheer1 Cheer1 Cheer1 Cheer1 Cheer1 Cheer1 Cheer1 Here some beautiful bits of wisdom for PlagueOhGripes
[0:12:11] <ahaegotrigger> LUL
[0:12:20] <Ipsenscastle> 7's Midgar cast is good, all the others are trash
[0:12:25] <CaptHat211> @professorno Hmmm X has Lulu.
[0:12:38] <Ipsenscastle> Also 7's Midgar bit is good, all the rest is trash
[0:12:43] <+thereisneverenoughdakka> Oh boy i cant get me enough of that cait sith
[0:12:47] <CaptHat211> 8 is too angsty.
[0:13:05] <+Skittlesoul> Salutations
[0:13:21] <saraizarai> XIV has the hottest cast. Due to sheer size.
[0:13:23] <Ipsenscastle> 12 has a hot cast, it's a shame most of them don't have personalities
[0:13:49] <saraizarai> Otherwise I'm stuck between XII and Tactics
[0:13:53] <+thereisneverenoughdakka> Damage boosting strats
[0:13:59] <glasphemy> You can be a real speedrunner if you believe
[0:14:11] <+Heart0fInk> Are you going to stream this when it comes out?
[0:14:33] <glasphemy> hehehe it's mah turn
[0:14:46] <+thereisneverenoughdakka> Oh boy they made cloud edgey but i love what they did with barret
[0:14:52] <+Skittlesoul> are you trying to match the 15:19 time?
[0:15:19] <%DaKnightWarrior> Barret's voice acing is great.
[0:16:15] <+thereisneverenoughdakka> @DaKnightWarrior yeye
[0:17:01] <Mizaiya> reset
[0:17:10] <CaptHat211> Barrett's VA? 10/10
[0:17:22] <%DaKnightWarrior> Not the speedrun lytAGH
[0:18:03] <+Cucamabungabu> @PlagueOfGripes Can you give your thoughts on the last chapter of beastars without spoiling anything? I personally really hated a certain promise.
[0:18:12] <+Heart0fInk> OOooooooh Exploit!
[0:18:47] <+thereisneverenoughdakka> @PlagueOfGripes Hero your health is low. Do you have any potions or food
[0:18:53] <DandyMackeroos> Love the system they implemented for Remake. It being both fast-paced and tactical.
[0:19:01] <glasphemy> He's speedrunning too hard and dangerously
[0:19:27] <Dredeezy> How come I can't find this in PlayStation store?
[0:20:21] <+Heart0fInk> @skiassassin Get that dirty Fable shit outta here!
[0:20:26] <glasphemy> blow him the hell up, my guy
[0:20:28] <Dredeezy> ???
[0:21:11] <mrjplays2k9> climb into his asshole
[0:21:12] <CaptHat211> Plague let's say SquareEnix contacts you to say that they're gonna put you in FF 7 DLC. You'll appear in the game as a NPC w/ a love interest of your choice. You get to pick your role. Off the top of your head what would it be?
[0:21:15] <glasphemy> Its ok, this is still a gold split
[0:21:35] <%Triblade1992> Plague REALLY loves playing this demoo
[0:21:39] <Dredeezy> Is this still available in the PlayStation store
[0:21:44] <CursedNobleman> @CaptHat211 airship crewmember LUL
[0:21:58] <cap_bon> Yes we get to see more of Biggs handsome face
[0:22:16] <%DaKnightWarrior> You're never going to be ready for Games Done Quick at this rate lytBEATSME
[0:22:36] <mrjplays2k9> I still cant believe they put this much effort into pranking people with a fake game
[0:22:41] <+Cucamabungabu> It's cool that Eli is wearing pants while streaming
[0:22:46] <CursedNobleman> DansGame
[0:22:51] <%Triblade1992> Yeah I wouldn't be surprised. It's like a mixture of FF13 and Kingdom Hearts for the combat
[0:22:58] <Lelfro> nice
[0:23:03] <mrjplays2k9> I dated a horse girl and it was a huge mistake
[0:23:03] <CursedNobleman> World of Horror Stream when? LUL
[0:23:07] <+Heart0fInk> I wish Cloud was an anthro chocobo
[0:23:14] <CursedNobleman> where does one meet horsegirls?
[0:23:15] <DandyMackeroos> Oh boy
[0:23:16] <cap_bon> Cloud seems like the guy who would just say "Cool" to people flirting with him
[0:23:38] <CaptHat211> So you're saying you want to be in the game w/ her as your love interest, but you want Cloud's hairstyle? Gotcha.
[0:23:43] <Zaphire_Saucypants> Take off yo pants, foo.
[0:23:52] <+FluffiTamamo> Exactly how many times have you played the demo by now?!
[0:23:58] <mrjplays2k9> Plague ill take off my pants if you take off yours
[0:24:10] <Zaphire_Saucypants> As will I
[0:24:50] <+Heart0fInk> What monster/enemy are you hoping stays in the game?
[0:24:56] <CaptHat211> @CusedNobleman I like it.
[0:25:03] <glasphemy> It's time
[0:25:24] <glasphemy> He needs your most powerful potions, he can't handle them but the situation is TOO DIRE
[0:25:26] <codycurry52> Plague's playing ff7remake PANTS ARE ALREADY OFF
[0:25:27] <CursedNobleman> im curious what eli thinks of world of horror, it being in his wheelhouse i surmise
[0:25:41] <$daveronald> loving the streams. are you planning in streaming more? plagueGripes
[0:25:52] <DandyMackeroos> Have you used the Grenades yet? I forgot to use them every time I got them.
[0:26:09] <CursedNobleman> nobody uses items in rpgs, items are for roguelikes
[0:26:14] <CaptHat211> OneyNG talked about this awhile ago and pointed out parts of the game made speedrunning impossible.
[0:26:21] <codycurry52> If you beat the demo in under 5 minutes you unlock Zack
[0:26:41] <CursedNobleman> if you speedrun the game, you can revive aerith
[0:27:05] <@Nightbot> Plague is a youtube animator and also streams at https://picarto.tv/Plague . Also: t-shirts! http://goo.gl/lze8QO
[0:27:12] <%Triblade1992> Imagine if someone was so fast in a speedrun that they could stop Aerith's death
[0:27:13] <CaptHat211> @CursedNobleman That's supposed to be incentive? No thanks.
[0:27:20] <glasphemy> So are you, you're on world record
[0:27:20] <+Heart0fInk> @codycurry52 Psychicpebbles Zack? PogChamp
[0:27:45] <DandyMackeroos> A little botched
[0:28:23] <CaptHat211> *golf clap*
[0:28:47] <%Triblade1992> LOL
[0:29:13] <glasphemy> -11 is a fast speedrun
[0:29:16] <+Heart0fInk> Was that long silver haired man the villain of 90% of Square games? PogChamp
[0:29:23] <+Cucamabungabu> not a bad schnellauf
[0:29:38] <%Triblade1992> Eh, Midgar is very linear and the guy who was the director of it (Motomu Toriyama) took that design and used it for FF10's linear design and FF13's linear design
[0:29:56] <DandyMackeroos> There aren’t that many lonf silver haired villain s in Squenix games
[0:30:22] <CaptHat211> He dumps the bunny and hooks up w/ the right choice Juno.
[0:30:59] <CaptHat211> I haven't read it yet so hopefully I didn't accidentally spoil it.
[0:31:07] <NirvashTypeMQ> u did
[0:31:19] <NirvashTypeMQ> tenchiSad
[0:32:00] <CaptHat211> @NirvashTypeMQ Get outta here.

[0:32:44] <+thackattack00> !uptime
[0:32:44] <@Nightbot> 32 minutes 53 seconds
[0:33:00] <%Triblade1992> We have to go faster Plague
[0:33:02] <Jynnanmalect> will you buy this?
[0:33:05] <NirvashTypeMQ> tenchiTogether tenchiForever
[0:33:10] <%Triblade1992> We have to break the 88 miles limit
[0:33:19] <+Cucamabungabu> @PlagueOfGripes SO can we expect Kyuu rabbit tits at some point in the future?
[0:33:22] <%KellBeII> Hey Eli did you hear that halo 1 is on steam now?
[0:33:24] <+Heart0fInk> What are your thoughts on interspecies reviewer?
[0:33:24] <DandyMackeroos> Time to overtake that previous best
[0:33:26] <+Heart0fInk> Kappa
[0:33:39] <Ether101_Prime> Hit the big button to get the bestery.
[0:34:00] <DandyMackeroos> You need those items they need to be in your comfortable pockets of yours.
[0:34:22] <Jynnanmalect> punisher mode is what happens when I get in the bedroom
[0:34:28] <+TQuick101> this is practice for a new cartoon, isn't it
[0:34:30] <DrFaustMD> heyooo
[0:34:30] <+thegoldenattack> Are you excited for RE3 Remake?
[0:34:34] <glasphemy> Dr Eli: Meat is needed to live
[0:34:39] <codycurry52> Cloud needs flesh badly
[0:34:40] <CaptHat211> You'd stab your heel w/ that thing on your back.
[0:34:42] <%DaKnightWarrior> atpCarl
[0:34:45] <Mizaiya> Is that why hes on top of the train at the begining?
[0:35:06] <DandyMackeroos> Cloud does make for an attractive woman.
[0:35:09] <glasphemy> Captain Jack Sparrow is that you?
[0:35:16] <friozen> plague how come you are so good at vidyas
[0:35:18] <CaptHat211> Sounds vaguely Pirates of the Caribbean
[0:35:19] <+Cucamabungabu> god i hate the ps 4
[0:35:20] <Jynnanmalect> camera/lockon is trash, so is the ai
[0:35:24] <Ether101_Prime> I really hope there's upgrades to to improve the switching between modes.
[0:35:48] <$daveronald> not announced
[0:36:03] <%Triblade1992> I think so. Hopefully they can build upon the good will the PS4 did and NOT PULL A PS3.
[0:36:05] <Jynnanmalect> @Ether101_Prime switching to punisher is faster than switching back
[0:36:12] <CaptHat211> Let me pet you with my BLADE!
[0:36:15] <Jynnanmalect> also its instant at the end of a combo
[0:36:53] <Ether101_Prime> @Jynnanmalect It needs to able to be done with no delay.
[0:36:56] <codycurry52> Enter GDQ not for the game only for the demo
[0:36:56] <%Samex_Comex> Beat the meat
[0:37:16] <Jynnanmalect> there is no delay if you time youre button
[0:37:29] <+Cucamabungabu> Eli's streams always get so erotic, Makes me sick! Makes Me SIck!!!
[0:37:30] <Lelfro> meat on the bone
[0:37:32] <+TQuick101> absolutely on pace
[0:37:39] <DandyMackeroos> She’s like internally thinking about Cloud but not talking to him.
[0:37:47] <Jynnanmalect> thots begone
[0:37:53] <CaptHat211> Imagine how awful we'd feel if we were watching FF13.
[0:38:00] <glasphemy> Fastest thing alive
[0:38:01] <TheOverwhelmingShotgun> splaguerunning
[0:38:06] <codycurry52> You need speedrun splits
[0:38:08] <glasphemy> Don diddly do a goodly
[0:38:09] <AmazingBlanket> so fast and so gud
[0:38:10] <$daveronald> is it Pro?
[0:38:14] <DandyMackeroos> Good big fast big run
[0:38:15] <$doomp12> much sped
[0:38:18] <%DaKnightWarrior> True Speed lytALRIGHT
[0:38:27] <+Cucamabungabu> PS 4 always feels like a warhammer 40k ork cosntruction when it starts running a game.
[0:38:30] <%Triblade1992> @CaptHat211 I platinumed that game as well as FF15.
[0:38:39] <Lelfro> do more fast
[0:38:42] <AmazingBlanket> restart
[0:38:55] <CaptHat211> @Triblade1992 Sadist.
[0:39:02] <+Heart0fInk> Steel Skin? or Steal Skin?
[0:39:13] <Omnislash195> Warm hair gel......
[0:39:17] <friozen> plague, what do you have against the ani mays?
[0:39:21] <%Triblade1992> @CaptHat211 It's quite fun. It wasn't at all difficult. Just a bit long.
[0:39:40] <codycurry52> I don't even know if that does damage
[0:39:45] <CaptHat211> I couldn't stand FF13's story and cast.
[0:39:53] <glasphemy> ancient technique of getting hit on every laser
[0:39:56] <%Triblade1992> Difficulty to platinum a game is when you have to do something like the DLC for Witcher 3.
[0:39:59] <AmazingBlanket> if you hit those lasers enough times Jessie asks if you have a fetish
[0:40:01] <Ether101_Prime> Cloud isn't a metrosexual, he's a fierce mako warrior.
[0:40:10] <%Triblade1992> Story was okay, characters were mostly good though @CaptHat211
[0:40:15] <+Heart0fInk> Jessie has every fetish
[0:40:25] <codycurry52> Lightnings sooo deep.... she's umm got pink hair and..... umm
[0:40:28] <+Cucamabungabu> @PlagueOfGripes Thoughts on Interspecies reviewers.
[0:40:49] <Jynnanmalect> lightning just has a shitty script
[0:41:01] <%Triblade1992> Maybe he's havinig an anyurism
[0:41:08] <Jynnanmalect> her lines are the worst ive heard from a character
[0:41:09] <+Heart0fInk> Live And Learn!!!
[0:41:16] <DandyMackeroos> Would be good if the tutorials only showed up once or you could turn them off.
[0:41:17] <CaptHat211> @codycurry52 she's ummm....*clicks tongue* got an interesting weapon?
[0:41:26] <Jynnanmalect> squall did it first
[0:41:35] <+Heart0fInk> Ew. what a fuckin weeb
[0:41:46] <Omnislash195> Just say no.........to FF13
[0:42:06] <$daveronald> lost seconds
[0:42:13] <codycurry52> @CaptHat211 She has a nice titty plate
[0:42:13] <DandyMackeroos> Is FF13 that bad?
[0:42:14] <nacheil> Just say yes to its music
[0:42:19] <Omnislash195> Sonic Plague
[0:42:23] <Dredeezy> Is this game still available in the PlayStation store?
[0:42:24] <Ether101_Prime> I hear the anime is lewded up as part of a movement to encourage the Japanese populace to go out and fuck.
[0:42:25] <+Cucamabungabu> Plague of speed sounds like such shit
[0:42:33] <+Heart0fInk> SpeedofGripes
[0:42:52] <Jynnanmalect> yeah he did
[0:42:52] <+Heart0fInk> yes
[0:42:52] <Ether101_Prime> It does as the 20 min option has a longer end video.
[0:43:00] <%Triblade1992> Did you hear about how the Kotaku player couldn't figure out the weakness to this machine despite CLoud telling the player and Barret it's lightning magic
[0:43:08] <DandyMackeroos> Yup
[0:43:08] <TheOverwhelmingShotgun> I kind of wish Plague would stream FF13 just to see what's left of his soul leave his body
[0:43:35] <Jynnanmalect> @Triblade1992 "too many systems"
[0:43:45] <Exadata_> wasn't eyeballs poping because of lightning a thing? or I'm stupid
[0:44:06] <CaptHat211> @codycurry52 It aint enough to make up for her abysmal nonexistent personality.
[0:44:13] <$doomp12> barret, don't bring soujia boy into this.
[0:44:20] <+Cucamabungabu> clench ass for performance increase
[0:45:24] <codycurry52> @CaptHat211 Dude pink hair is a personality, just check twitter
[0:45:39] <nacheil> xD
[0:45:40] <%DaKnightWarrior> lytFIRSTTRY
[0:46:15] <Lelfro> just draw
[0:46:37] <terminusterminal> Hooray! I made it in time for a stream!
[0:46:55] <codycurry52> @TheOverwhelmingShotgun I'd love a ff13 stream. Plague or Pat.
[0:47:07] <+Cucamabungabu> @PlagueOfGripes Are you going to try out that amazon mmo new worlds?
[0:47:21] <Mizaiya> does limit break build more the more you use a char?
[0:47:22] <peachy996> An incidental 1% chance of Barret encouraging Cloud
[0:48:00] <CaptHat211> @codycurry52 No man you're thinking of regular hair color w/ one blue/purple streak in the front. "I may look like a normal girl, but if you'll note the purple/blue streak in my hair I'm quite unique/original." -Millions of shallow clones.
[0:48:05] <codycurry52> @Mizaiya damage taken
[0:48:24] <Jynnanmalect> why is not named big shot
[0:48:31] <terminusterminal> I hope Barrett and Cid both swear waaaaay more
[0:48:34] <Mizaiya> oof thats weird
[0:48:52] <+thackattack00> Yeah 33
[0:49:12] <peachy996> Am I crazy or Wasn't there early footage where Barret was acting stoic and sounded different?
[0:49:19] <codycurry52> @CaptHat211 do they have one side shaved?
[0:49:26] <DandyMackeroos> @mizaiya Pretty sure the damage taken mechanic is a hold over from the original game.
[0:49:27] <%DaKnightWarrior> Seconds lost atpFeelsBeardMan
[0:49:48] <Jynnanmalect> thats how limit always worked
[0:49:54] <+Cucamabungabu> This message is special
[0:49:56] <Exadata_> speedrun ruined restart
[0:50:02] <Mizaiya> never played the og
[0:50:10] <glasphemy> youre special
[0:50:24] <CaptHat211> @codycurry52 Only if they want to show they're REALLY original/unique.
[0:50:35] <%DaKnightWarrior> That would be cool.
[0:50:39] <Mizaiya> I thought itd be something like using magic they are weak to
[0:50:41] <Jynnanmalect> oh overdrive modes form FFX
[0:50:44] <Mizaiya> to encourage finding them
[0:50:53] <+Cucamabungabu> Is there a single artist on this world that hasn't drawn porn at some point in their lifes?
[0:50:53] <Jynnanmalect> those were kinda broke
[0:50:55] <ahaegotrigger> oh no got a bad seed
[0:51:07] <Jynnanmalect> my entire life is just a bad seed
[0:51:09] <DandyMackeroos> Bad seed all over
[0:51:26] <codycurry52> Like all the other original/unique girls online
[0:51:29] <Exadata_> wow it did take you like 5 seconds

[0:52:47] <terminusterminal> @PlagueOfGripes In the original game (and only the original game) was the Buster Sword THAT special. It's description now is like some legacy shit
[0:53:02] <TheDr0t> hello there
[0:53:07] <+Cucamabungabu> @PlagueOfGripes what made you go crazier? Second dark souls lp or the last stretch of playing FF14?

[0:56:20] <Exadata_> its a demo and people are already speedrunning it?
[0:56:22] <bettysharkface> How many times have you beat it now?
[0:56:22] <%DaKnightWarrior> atpUgly
[0:56:45] <ahaegotrigger> SpeedGripes is a winner
[0:56:46] <CaptHat211> Cloud: "Sephiroth, ready for a new wave of slashfic?" Sephiroth: "...it never stopped, Cloud."
[0:56:47] <%Samex_Comex> The speed of heat
[0:56:48] <+Cucamabungabu> its better than plague of speed, that's for sure
[0:56:49] <Omnislash195> Sonic Plague
[0:56:52] <bettysharkface> Fast griping for faster times.
[0:56:59] <CaptHat211> SONIC GRIPES
[0:57:08] <%Triblade1992> Sounds like you are trying to make videos of Sonic the Hedghog with "Speed of Gripes"
[0:57:13] <DandyMackeroos> Dash of Plagues
[0:57:16] <Artista_AF> Gripesome Plagues Done Quick

[0:57:32] <codycurry52> Bible black
[0:57:40] <glasphemy> 2TB of naughtybits
[0:57:52] <+Cucamabungabu> @PlagueOfGripes what made you go crazier? Second dark souls lp or the last stretch of playing FF14?
[0:58:16] <CaptHat211> Plague's in a bidding war for a rare Rouge figure.
[0:58:18] <$daveronald> I thought you were a solitary plague
[0:58:19] <Omnislash195> Time to mess with some QoS settings on the router.....
[0:58:20] <bettysharkface> "Hey you kids, stop all the downloading"
[0:58:25] <+fingalights> smell the bandwidth being used
[0:58:42] <%Triblade1992> FF14 and other MMOs are designed to be filler.
[0:59:04] <MrHappyFunshine> Something that cause my soul to leave my body was realising that i was 9 when the PS3 tech demo was shown off
[0:59:12] <+Cucamabungabu> Plague of Speed
[0:59:13] <%Triblade1992> It's that bad 80's to 90's design of 'stretch out game time with artificial difficulty'
[0:59:17] <CaptHat211> "I was working to feed my...family"
[0:59:29] <%DaKnightWarrior> Time starts now! FBtouchdown
[0:59:31] <terminusterminal> Lock your family out of the internet for the youtube views
[0:59:40] <AmazingBlanket> so far so good
[0:59:41] <%JJCheeker> I really like the music
[0:59:48] <$daveronald> your wasting time!!!
[0:59:57] <bettysharkface> Speed run ruined
[1:00:03] <DandyMackeroos> No, Plague of Speed this run
[1:00:05] <+Cucamabungabu> What a Mellowrun
[1:00:05] <+fingalights> You're losing WR pace!!
[1:00:16] <Omnislash195> Time to pull some ethernet cables
[1:00:21] <MrHappyFunshine> God this music makes me so god damn nostalgic
[1:00:28] <%JJCheeker> It's so good
[1:00:35] <%Triblade1992> Game designs I HATE are artificial difficulty to stretch out gameplay time and OPEN WORLD = GUD GAEM.
[1:00:45] <CaptHat211> Remember this as the day that you almost caught CAPTAIN JACK SPARROW
[1:00:48] <codycurry52> this is just RNG manipulation
[1:01:02] <%Triblade1992> It's the reason why I can enjoy linear games like FF10 and FF13 while hate games like Dragon Age Inquisition and Batman Arkham Knight
[1:01:17] <DandyMackeroos> OPEN WORLD always seemed like an excuse to not focus on more important details.
[1:01:20] <Lelfro> "He's moving so fast it looks like he's standing still! As expected of Plague of Speed"
[1:01:24] <+Cucamabungabu> Plague of Speed
[1:01:36] <glasphemy> The Speed of Gripes
[1:01:37] <glasphemy> Zoon
[1:01:37] <Exadata_> wait that how you pronounce lan?
[1:01:42] <CaptHat211> The Speed of Gripes! YES!
[1:01:56] <codycurry52> You got it. message end

[1:01:59] <terminusterminal> Speedrun life with the Coronavirus
[1:02:06] <CaptHat211> @glasphemy You got it!
[1:02:13] <MrHappyFunshine> I feel bad for the shinra troopers
[1:02:15] <bettysharkface> Man I work at a grocery store, if I get through this virus shit without catching it, I'll be shocked.
[1:02:24] <+thackattack00> lmao
[1:02:45] <glasphemy> Not too many people infected yet though
[1:02:47] <Exadata_> I´ve never said it out loud or heard someone say it so I had no idea
[1:02:47] <MrHappyFunshine> You also gotta watch out for the toilet paper banditos
[1:03:00] <DandyMackeroos> I’m a little bit of a moron then
[1:03:26] <glasphemy> Hey look on the bright side, I'm going to china within the month :>
[1:03:34] <Krimxon> I mean, Barret is black; you think they're gonna NOT shoot?
[1:03:34] <DandyMackeroos> @glasphemy Oh boy
[1:03:34] <%KellBeII> "hes pickin his nose, get him!"
[1:03:36] <codycurry52> I've never cared to learn what LAN stood for
[1:03:36] <bettysharkface> They're sleepy bullets, for making naps happen.
[1:03:39] <CaptHat211> "Dead or alive you're coming w/ me"
[1:03:44] <+fingalights> Don't shoot! He's not black
[1:04:02] <%DaKnightWarrior> @fingalights lytDUNKED
[1:04:03] <MrHappyFunshine> Zack isn't dead, he is just sleeping which makes Cloud a thief
[1:04:05] <terminusterminal> How many times have you played this?
[1:04:07] <Lelfro> We'll skin you and make one!
[1:04:10] <DandyMackeroos> They kinda completely ignore Barret and the gang
[1:04:10] <Omnislash195> Badger wedge
[1:04:41] <CaptHat211> You're clearly having so much fun.
[1:04:49] <DandyMackeroos> Or the Shinra Soldiers have complete tunnel vision in those helmets
[1:04:52] <%KellBeII> oh wow that is badger
[1:04:57] <codycurry52> Bill Burrs "that guy from Breaking bad"
[1:04:57] <+Cucamabungabu> @PlagueOfGripes you gave me a farm girl fetish, you ass
[1:05:06] <+thackattack00> what?
[1:05:12] <%DaKnightWarrior> lytLEERY
[1:05:17] <glasphemy> No he didn't, he taught you something about yourself you didn't know. Thank him
[1:05:19] <bettysharkface> WutFace
[1:05:29] <forgottwodie> cloud be like >///< B-B-B-BAKA
[1:05:45] <Admiral_PopnFresh> Sure, Plague...
[1:05:50] <CaptHat211> Hey Plague @glasphemy came up w/ your speed-running name: SPEED OF GRIPES
[1:06:04] <codycurry52> Reverse mermaids should NOT be that sexy Plague
[1:06:04] <Animorphimagi> Farmgirl fetish is pretty much just incest
[1:06:05] <glasphemy> It's more a description than a nme
[1:06:09] <bettysharkface> What is gunny
[1:06:16] <bettysharkface> Is it a granma?
[1:06:37] <DandyMackeroos> Nice tech
[1:06:41] <CaptHat211> I meant the name for his speedrunning channel
[1:06:42] <%DaKnightWarrior> New Tech PogChamp
[1:06:51] <bettysharkface> A movie, I haven't seen it
[1:06:52] <MrHappyFunshine> Farmer Tristana was :)
[1:06:53] <@Nightbot> Plague is a youtube animator and also streams at https://picarto.tv/Plague . Also: t-shirts! http://goo.gl/lze8QO
[1:07:03] <glasphemy> yung gunny
[1:07:03] <CaptHat211> PATTON'
[1:07:17] <Admiral_PopnFresh> man, imagine being trained as a trooper and this dude with a cartoonish sword starts running at you
[1:07:17] <CaptHat211> No, Full Metal Jacket. Sorry.
[1:07:19] <MrHappyFunshine> I learned what Gunny was from Halo when i was a kid
[1:07:20] <Omnislash195> What? No curse words in the army?
[1:07:26] <%KellBeII> same funshine
[1:07:36] <glasphemy> I'm imagining passive aggressive sergeants now
[1:07:39] <codycurry52> YOU POOP FACE DROP DOWN AND GIVE ME 2!
[1:07:54] <Omnislash195> Oh, doo doo I have been shot.
[1:07:55] <%KellBeII> Buck
[1:08:00] <DandyMackeroos> Oh neat
[1:08:08] <terminusterminal> But one time my gunnery sergeant called me a doodoo head and it hurt my feefees
[1:08:27] <glasphemy> Is that @TheRealKellanBellan ?
[1:08:31] <MrHappyFunshine> Fighting the dogs makes me think of Oney making the sound effects of omnislashing a dog.
[1:09:00] <+fingalights> Whaaat?! Lies
[1:09:01] <Animorphimagi> Thats quitter talk Plague
[1:09:03] <%KellBeII> turns out that makes them super unstable
[1:09:05] <CaptHat211> But is Eskimo pussy still mighty cold?
[1:09:07] <Omnislash195> Ah, like marriage?
[1:09:16] <DandyMackeroos> The psyche is a fragile thing
[1:09:19] <+fingalights> sounds like they all lost twice
[1:09:28] <bazz_tv> saludos from Chile, Plague
[1:09:28] <codycurry52> We're sorry
[1:09:49] <Lelfro> They'll definitely won't take those lesson to home with their kids or wife
[1:09:51] <defaultname3887> Eyy another chileno
[1:10:04] <ahaegotrigger> perfect
[1:10:06] <terminusterminal> The power of friendship will help me shoot this child soldier in the face!
[1:10:09] <ahaegotrigger> anime soldiers
[1:10:10] <bazz_tv> only in the south of Chile
[1:10:16] <Admiral_PopnFresh> Mamoru
[1:10:20] <bettysharkface> It snows in Australia
[1:10:22] <Artista_AF> only in the south or the mountains
[1:10:32] <DandyMackeroos> Gotta Mamoru America
[1:10:33] <Artista_AF> the rest is dry cold
[1:10:39] <MrHappyFunshine> I know that protecting or helping others is usually enough of a insensitive to get me to do a thing.
[1:10:40] <%KellBeII> the world is too hot
[1:10:42] <glasphemy> I live in a place like that, south of china
[1:10:50] <+Cucamabungabu> @PlagueOfGripes Any upcoming games you are looking forward to?
[1:10:53] <ahaegotrigger> through the power of friendship killing child soldiers may even be fun
[1:10:54] <Artista_AF> or a small drizzle that floods half the Capital because our swere system sucks
[1:10:54] <%KellBeII> we need to get a big ice cube and put it on earth
[1:10:55] <bazz_tv> like if you want snow you have to go to the patagonia
[1:10:55] <glasphemy> coldest it is is 18 Celcius
[1:10:58] <CharlesRobinJr> people know about the arctic no one remembers the antarctic
[1:11:04] <+fingalights> And they say heat rises. Explain that roundies
[1:11:09] <ahaegotrigger> how dare they touch before paying
[1:11:22] <bettysharkface> In Australia we get snow, and hail can happen even during summer.
[1:11:25] <bazz_tv> but right now in the Santiago is hot as fuck, is still summer
[1:11:25] <ahaegotrigger> antartica is very cold
[1:11:34] <%Triblade1992> Elden Ring is a myth, Plague
[1:11:46] <+thackattack00> What about RE3?
[1:11:46] <bazz_tv> hey Plague have you seen Castlevania season 3?
[1:11:49] <%Triblade1992> A fever dream everyone collectively came up with
[1:11:53] <DandyMackeroos> What even is an Elden Ring?
[1:11:56] <CharlesRobinJr> if i can remember parts of south america are near antarctica
[1:11:58] <MrHappyFunshine> Mr.Metro was one of my nicknames in high school, fun times
[1:12:04] <CaptHat211> I like her.
[1:12:10] <%Triblade1992> @DandyMackeroos I said it was a fever dream
[1:12:26] <%KellBeII> heat bad
[1:12:31] <terminusterminal> Well in Australia there's a place creatively named the "Snowy Mountains"
[1:12:32] <$daveronald> yes the south
[1:12:33] <sosuke5> In high altitude areas. But yes, it's hot most of the time
[1:12:46] <Admiral_PopnFresh> the Blue mountains get snow in their winter
[1:12:46] <+Arkanrais> elevation = snow
[1:12:48] <DandyMackeroos> Ah, must be my delirium every-time someone posts Elden Ring titles
[1:12:50] <Highwang> so was this scene with Heiddeger and Shinra in the original game?
[1:12:52] <SoushinSen> Just hold your head upside down, and you'll feel like an australian
[1:12:59] <Highwang> cause I don't recall a hit on President Shrinra in the original
[1:13:07] <CharlesRobinJr> woah shinra look great
[1:13:10] <%KellBeII> oh heck yeah re3 o/
[1:13:14] <CaptHat211> "I'm gonna go gargle more gravel, sir"
[1:13:16] <bettysharkface> In Victoria, Sydney is in New South Wales, which is the middle of the east coast. Victoria is in the south of the east coast.
[1:13:16] <terminusterminal> Elden Bling
[1:13:17] <+Cucamabungabu> I wish I could grow a handsome beard like those evilmen
[1:13:21] <DandyMackeroos> @highwang It’s not in the original
[1:13:21] <MrHappyFunshine> I love new Barret
[1:13:23] <%not_crabby> hard to give a shit about a game that doesnt exist tbh
[1:13:24] <+Heart0fInk> Mah-Ko
[1:13:28] <+fingalights> no, that's new highwang
[1:13:41] <Highwang> thought so. That segment felt odd. So then who were the original hitmen?
[1:13:47] <CaptHat211> "I PITY THE FOO WHO DON'T HEAR THE PLANET CRYING IN PAIN!!!"
[1:13:52] <sosuke5> Victorians are the worst drivers
[1:13:58] <bettysharkface> It also snows in Tasmania, and it even sometimes snows in New South Wales.
[1:14:01] <codycurry52> DAMN!
[1:14:04] <bazz_tv> Is Barret a hippie ? like Mr.T if it was a hippie
[1:14:05] <PowerfulBlackGangs> But no shades
[1:14:07] <+Heart0fInk> I'd run my cheek across his hair
[1:14:13] <%Triblade1992> Just with a lot more bleeping of swear words
[1:14:16] <+fingalights> no one as far as I know. no hitmen
[1:14:19] <Highwang> also I'm going to be upset if Barret doesn't eventually mention "this fucking pizza" like in the original
[1:14:29] <DandyMackeroos> That was is just Barret
[1:14:29] <Admiral_PopnFresh> because Victoria is tiny and dominated by Melbourne
[1:14:30] <terminusterminal> I hope FF7 is allowed to say the N-Word
[1:14:38] <MrHappyFunshine> I think it i more due to it being a voiced performance, i mostly just remember him swearing
[1:14:50] <CharlesRobinJr> this is the first im seeing the new demo looks great
[1:14:54] <%KellBeII> try to find the Tasmanian tiger
[1:15:01] <CharlesRobinJr> facts
[1:15:07] <bazz_tv> dang now i have the Taz-Mania theme son playing in mi head
[1:15:08] <+fingalights> Don't touch people's hair, you weird people
[1:15:10] <Admiral_PopnFresh> Plague...
[1:15:12] <CaptHat211> "Oh its like a sheep!"
[1:15:15] <$doomp12> as a black man, I concur.
[1:15:17] <DandyMackeroos> Hmmm
[1:15:20] <Andele1503> >not from personal experience Ah, so Plague touched black bird ladies fluffy feathers
[1:15:24] <+Heart0fInk> At least give them 5$ first
[1:15:29] <+Cucamabungabu> Plague of Gripes Eugenics stream
[1:15:30] <bettysharkface> You can't drive to Tasmania @PlagueOfGripes though I'd like to see you try.
[1:15:31] <%DaKnightWarrior> atpCarl lytSNEER
[1:15:33] <poolfullofghoul> Will this game run on intel graphics?
[1:15:33] <glasphemy> Gorsh
[1:15:36] <%KellBeII> briefly white people turn into goofy when they do it
[1:15:38] <CharlesRobinJr> when i used to have an afro constant people touching my hair
[1:15:40] <Murphio_GS> I do that to my own hair
[1:15:46] <glasphemy> Dr Plague with the Psychology
[1:15:57] <+Cucamabungabu> @PlagueOfGripes Can you do that fart noise thing with your hand under your armpit please?
[1:15:59] <poolfullofghoul> That sword def giving Cloud back problems.
[1:16:00] <MrHappyFunshine> I have that that happen to me with my beard sometimes, in the past people used to do that with my hair cause of how it was naturally in ringlets
[1:16:04] <CaptHat211> I'd do it too honestly.
[1:16:05] <codycurry52> THOSE MACHINES KILL DINE!!!
[1:16:06] <%not_crabby> drive a land boat
[1:16:11] <Admiral_PopnFresh> I've heard it's a thing with Japanese folk as well...not great
[1:16:12] <+Heart0fInk> You can drive to Hawaii
[1:16:16] <Lelfro> Goofy stop touching hair
[1:16:21] <$daveronald> its called a ferry
[1:16:37] <bazz_tv> does this really still qualifies as an rpg? because it looks like an slower action game to me
[1:16:47] <bettysharkface> @PlagueOfGripes The water between Tasmania and mainland is choppy as hell.
[1:16:48] <CharlesRobinJr> pat
[1:16:49] <DandyMackeroos> Hair touching sounds like it’d be extremely uncomfortable if you aren’t asked.
[1:16:52] <$daveronald> its a clasic
[1:17:17] <Highwang> oh man yeah. how the hell are they gonna animate Barret & Dyne?
[1:17:18] <codycurry52> They all gotta die though
[1:17:23] <sosuke5> If someone tries to touch my hair, they're gonna get a handful of dandruff
[1:17:31] <CaptHat211> Plague...
[1:17:34] <+fingalights> Blonde women in red dresses cut hands off
[1:17:35] <Admiral_PopnFresh> Plague...
[1:17:42] <MrHappyFunshine> She likes cloud cwispy
[1:17:44] <Murphio_GS> *dark souls hurt noises*
[1:17:44] <CharlesRobinJr> yes she phased through
[1:17:44] <+Heart0fInk> You have never gotten through there without getting hit LUL
[1:17:52] <codycurry52> DAMN!
[1:17:59] <PowerfulBlackGangs> He refuses to run from machines
[1:18:01] <Omnislash195> She's a ghost
[1:18:04] <Admiral_PopnFresh> LUL
[1:18:06] <Shardlab> She's that good, Plague
[1:18:13] <+Heart0fInk> Does she even have a hitbox?
[1:18:19] <+Heart0fInk> fair
[1:18:24] <DandyMackeroos> Her thin female figure can slip through the lasers
[1:18:28] <+fingalights> Oh, she got a hitbox
[1:19:13] <+Heart0fInk> Oops
[1:19:14] <Artista_AF> LUL

[1:19:48] <CharlesRobinJr> how long can you stay in that screen
[1:19:48] <MrHappyFunshine> "Cloud, what you doin juss standin there? move your spiky ass and help the fuck out"
[1:20:01] <Shardlab> As fast as it hit him, you're not likely to always notice
[1:20:38] <bazz_tv> ed209 are always fun to kill
[1:20:41] <+fingalights> shame there's only two
[1:20:48] <%DaKnightWarrior> I kind of miss the victory theme.
[1:20:49] <Jflaskd13> same, but countering the physical attacks of the berserkers is really fun
[1:21:05] <DandyMackeroos> @daknightwarrior Barrets hums it sometimes
[1:21:09] <Jflaskd13> doodLewd
[1:21:09] <Omnislash195> hanging on the edge of tomorrow?
[1:21:12] <+Heart0fInk> do you think Cloud has a fempenis?
[1:21:13] <terminusterminal> Seriously, what the fuck is Barrett talking about?
[1:21:27] <%DaKnightWarrior> @dandymackeroos really?!
[1:21:30] <+Cucamabungabu> @PlagueOfGripes DId you study art?
[1:21:32] <MrHappyFunshine> Yeah it is kinda like a TMP
[1:21:33] <codycurry52> Clouds making Barrett Question himself
[1:21:39] <DandyMackeroos> Yeah occassionally
[1:21:41] <Jflaskd13> nah she just runs like she has a gun for confidence Kappa
[1:21:59] <Jflaskd13> glue gun
[1:22:08] <bazz_tv> looks like a small uzi
[1:22:10] <+Arkanrais> forward grip
[1:22:11] <Artista_AF> is a nail gun?
[1:22:11] <terminusterminal> It's like a nailgun
[1:22:13] <CharlesRobinJr> a knife maybe
[1:22:21] <+Heart0fInk> Looks like a paint gun
[1:22:23] <SirMcSlushy> Uzi with a tiny ass bipod?
[1:22:23] <MrHappyFunshine> I think it is some kinda makeshift for grip
[1:22:29] <MrHappyFunshine> like a Mac11
[1:22:33] <codycurry52> It does look like a nailgun
[1:22:41] <Owkono> to cut the fences?
[1:22:44] <DandyMackeroos> She does have a cute butt and I mean she does tell Cloud to look at it.
[1:22:48] <bazz_tv> a chibi uzi
[1:22:55] <terminusterminal> Plague didn't study art but he's still a man of specific cultures
[1:22:56] <+Arkanrais> it's like a weaved cloth loop, similar material to a sling
[1:22:58] <SirMcSlushy> SUCK IT
[1:23:06] <Phob05> It looks like someone saw a folding stock, didn't know what it was and thought "oh hey thet's a cool design element."
[1:23:18] <MrHappyFunshine> Either that or it is some kinda handguard
[1:23:23] <+Arkanrais> they put em on vewry small SMGs some times
[1:23:29] <codycurry52> "gonna make your eyeballs pop!" He's fighting robots
[1:23:46] <red_blaster> I found the concept art for Jessie's gun, but I don't understand it: https://i.pinimg.com/originals/80/cc/2f/80cc2f1e9bf68417a7da9e1a1ae6ebca.jpg
[1:23:55] <bazz_tv> games with stages feel better to speedruns
[1:24:02] <Jflaskd13> there's a joy in doing well regardless of perfection where things get far too stringent
[1:24:08] <+fingalights> I feel like speed running or level 1 runs kinda ruin games for me
[1:24:11] <bazz_tv> i have never liked the idea of rpg speedruns
[1:24:13] <SirMcSlushy> Protects her hand from bullets?
[1:24:14] <codycurry52> Resident Evil is fun to speed run
[1:24:17] <terminusterminal> Calculations vs Choices
[1:24:27] <+Heart0fInk> When is Sora, Donald and Goofy going to show up in this game?
[1:24:36] <MrHappyFunshine> Yeah definately seems like a handguard/foregrip
[1:24:38] <DandyMackeroos> Her gun is just a fancy Uzi
[1:24:51] <codycurry52> @Heart0fInk disc 3
[1:25:02] <%not_crabby> did i miss him playing classic mode?
[1:25:10] <Jflaskd13> it can feel like what's the point if there's no wiggle room, might as well be a calculator
[1:25:22] <%not_crabby> oh hey i got a gift sub while i was unconscious thanks stranger
[1:25:47] <%Triblade1992> Eh, I hate what Open World has become though. I rather play a linear game than suffer through the copy paste design of open world
[1:26:04] <Jflaskd13> does @PlagueOfGripes know about killing the shield generator with fire to the butt
[1:26:05] <codycurry52> It's lame plays itself
[1:26:05] <cap_bon> How dare you sraty from the intended path and time frame we set for you player
[1:26:11] <bazz_tv> How old is cloud suppose to be anyway?
[1:26:16] <+Heart0fInk> What's classic mode?
[1:26:26] <+Cucamabungabu> @PlagueOfGripes Did going bald increase your wisdom?
[1:26:48] <Jflaskd13> tifa is 20 aerith is 22
[1:26:50] <MrHappyFunshine> I biggest example for me is in Dragon's Dogma i place Portcrystals at specific locations to remove a lot of travel times for missions long before i get to them.
[1:26:51] <bazz_tv> he looks younger than that
[1:27:00] <%not_crabby> sad
[1:27:04] <@Nightbot> Plague is a youtube animator and also streams at https://picarto.tv/Plague . Also: t-shirts! http://goo.gl/lze8QO
[1:27:05] <+fingalights> Spiderman is 18
[1:27:10] <Jflaskd13> balding teaches you how to deal with loss and changing perception of self
[1:27:21] <cap_bon> Whats the stat modifier on bald ?
[1:27:31] <bazz_tv> movie spiderman maybe
[1:27:54] <MrHappyFunshine> I was described as shy, quiet, smart and above all ginger
[1:27:55] <bazz_tv> comic book spiderman has been stucked in his early 30's since the 90's
[1:28:11] <+twostrong> i wonder how this game is going to do kotr and the other weird summons
[1:28:14] <limabees> I feel like a lot of kids who were called wise beyond their years were like that because they had to grow up too fast
[1:28:14] <SirMcSlushy> Hit the Butt Hole
[1:28:19] <Artista_AF> i thought it was more damage & built up Stager faster
[1:28:20] <codycurry52> Imagine a anime about old people? You know 30 year olds
[1:28:23] <$daveronald> I have gained wisdom by slowly realizing every mistake I've made years later
[1:28:32] <Murphio_GS> I was told the same, wise for my age, but I think it's just other kids around me were stupid (I was also stupid but in other ways)
[1:28:34] <Jflaskd13> some attacks or spells can inflict pressure status which allows for easy stun build
[1:28:41] <%KellBeII> I can relate to that
[1:28:44] <+Cucamabungabu> sounds pretty similar to me
[1:28:59] <+Heart0fInk> I still don't have my licence and i'm almost 30
[1:29:00] <Shardlab> I get it
[1:29:08] <+twostrong> what does aggressive mean
[1:29:10] <+twostrong> like trying to fight
[1:29:17] <Shardlab> I was never the guy chasing tail for the sake of it
[1:29:24] <MrHappyFunshine> Same, there were many times when i could have just gave in to peer pressure and do drugs and drink but i just don't care for that life style.
[1:29:25] <+Cucamabungabu> @twostrong it's more like pinching strangers penises i think
[1:29:32] <DandyMackeroos> Why chase tail when video games
[1:29:34] <+twostrong> oh i only do that to friends
[1:29:34] <codycurry52> Ones Black the others a femboy!
[1:29:41] <CaptHat211> "He's a metro! And he's black!"
[1:29:42] <bazz_tv> I had a driver license but i let it expire because i don't use it
[1:29:43] <%not_crabby> @Cucamabungabu to assert dominance?
[1:29:59] <%not_crabby> or like for sex
[1:29:59] <Santimaci> is this demo gud
[1:30:03] <+Cucamabungabu> @not_crabby You are riight on!
[1:30:04] <$daveronald> its anime
[1:30:07] <$doomp12> what do you think of hunter x hunter?
[1:30:09] <+Arkanrais> I can almost hear Dropout screaming from here
[1:30:29] <glasphemy> It's an ancient black dragon "Well I'm an ancient black man" - Xavier Woods
[1:30:32] <+Cucamabungabu> @not_crabby I think it depend on the situation. But generally I read it as a dominance thing. Like t-posing you know.
[1:30:33] <terminusterminal> Corel
[1:30:34] <+MagiMeryk> corel
[1:30:34] <%Triblade1992> Nibilheim
[1:30:52] <DandyMackeroos> @codycurry52 What’re the prerequisites for being a femboy?
[1:31:13] <MrHappyFunshine> He seemed a lot more subdued in the flash back in the original game
[1:32:12] <bazz_tv> is overrated imo, and people here in Chile Love it, i have been pressured by friends into watching almost all of the anime
[1:32:27] <+Heart0fInk> Wait! You don't like Emo boy? Or Smart one? Or Girl?
[1:32:30] <codycurry52> @DandyMackeroos Everything changed after one night in the Honey Bee Inn
[1:32:32] <bazz_tv> from the old one to the most recent, I still don't care for it
[1:32:33] <%not_crabby> #scorpianlivematter
[1:32:45] <DandyMackeroos> @codycurry52 Oh now I know
[1:33:08] <bazz_tv> Gon is just too boring
[1:33:14] <+Cucamabungabu> @PlagueOfGripes When are you going to do a cooking stream with dedicated ovencam?
[1:33:31] <DandyMackeroos> Hunter x Hunter has you asking a lot of questions, but you don’t seem to get answers.
[1:33:59] <eldragon_1> Woolie did
[1:34:03] <MrHappyFunshine> I heven't seen the limit breaks in this yet
[1:34:05] <DandyMackeroos> Woolie asks the right questions
[1:34:38] <terminusterminal> Do Social Eating
[1:34:47] <DandyMackeroos> @mrhappyfunshine Cloud has Cross Slash and Barret has a Big Boom, I think?
[1:34:55] <bazz_tv> hey Plague and chat have seen Castlevania season 3 yet? or is it too soon
[1:35:01] <Murphio_GS> What I like about Hunter X Hunter is less about the shonen part of it and more about how characters are written
[1:35:06] <%Triblade1992> Showing it's Manus and throwing a temper tantrum
[1:35:12] <nivtiart> I forgot the 3rd season is out
[1:35:16] <DandyMackeroos> @bazz_tv Is that out already?
[1:35:21] <bazz_tv> yes
[1:35:30] <DandyMackeroos> Neato
[1:35:32] <bazz_tv> season 3 is 10 episodes
[1:35:43] <MrHappyFunshine> Havin cross slash as his base limit makes sense, it was Zacks signature move
[1:35:58] <+twostrong> i think i'm gonna watch that when i lay down
[1:36:12] <Jflaskd13> you have made me hungry thanks
[1:36:13] <DandyMackeroos> @mrhappyfunshine That a Crisis Core thing? Neat line up if so.
[1:36:16] <nivtiart> season 2 is good
[1:36:23] <+Heart0fInk> What boss are you looking forward to seeing/fighting?
[1:36:35] <%Triblade1992> Some people think Dracula's characterization is kind of bastardized in season 2
[1:36:35] <+twostrong> obviously the optional bosses
[1:36:39] <bazz_tv> season 1 is so short that it kinda melds with 2
[1:36:40] <DandyMackeroos> I mean the idea is that Cloud is acting like Zack, right?
[1:36:49] <MrHappyFunshine> Yeah in Crisis core it is called chain slash but Zack does the same movements as cross slash
[1:36:49] <codycurry52> Hi I'm from Kotaku Ah how did you do that?
[1:36:54] <Highwang> Stilva?
[1:37:03] <Major_monotone> Hello Plague and chat! How are we doing tonight?
[1:37:14] <+MagiMeryk> proud clod~
[1:37:38] <Phob05> Destiny's destiny
[1:37:41] <DandyMackeroos> @major_monotone Pretty good and you?
[1:38:01] <Highwang> Wow. I don't recall that fight at all. Is that the Aqua Rake fight?
[1:38:02] <bazz_tv> wasn´t there a journo controversy with the Megaman Zero/zx collection or something like that?
[1:38:03] <terminusterminal> You think they're gonna include Gackt in the FF7 remake?
[1:38:05] <nivtiart> it is rather ...horny
[1:38:07] <%not_crabby> shes not that big
[1:38:15] <Major_monotone> @dandymackeroos I’m good thanks!
[1:38:16] <+Heart0fInk> Stilva kinda looks like a digimon. not gonna lie.
[1:38:23] <nivtiart> it does!
[1:38:24] <bazz_tv> like a jorunalist wasn't able to beat Aztec Falcon or something like that
[1:38:30] <+MagiMeryk> I wanna see Palmer get hit by that truck in Rocket Town LUL
[1:38:35] <%not_crabby> plagueFace_SG plagueFace_SG
[1:38:37] <PowerfulBlackGangs> That sounds like the Materia Keeper
[1:38:39] <MrHappyFunshine> Im mostly looking forward to the first Jenova fight
[1:38:39] <Highwang> Man, I don't remember that at all. and yeah its probably Aqua Lung, it was Rake in 5/6
[1:38:52] <Highwang> OH, its the trine fight. now I remember
[1:38:56] <%not_crabby> the sunglasses in this edit are in the best possible place
[1:38:57] <+Arkanrais> square have said all extended universe crap is excluded from the game. at best it will mention it
[1:39:16] <DandyMackeroos> @highwang Isn’t that the Materia Keeper or something?
[1:39:42] <codycurry52> Soulja Boy tell'em
[1:39:43] <Highwang> I honestly dont remember much of overworld FF7. just Midgar and City of the Ancients
[1:39:43] <%not_crabby> for the right amount of points i can edit any emote :)
[1:39:59] <bazz_tv> superman dat hoe
[1:40:02] <+Heart0fInk> Sora! PogChamp
[1:40:22] <%not_crabby> plagueChirei_TK
[1:40:23] <PowerfulBlackGangs> Nah, bring in Genesis
[1:40:27] <%not_crabby> look how happy she is
[1:40:33] <Highwang> Barret is Soul, Cloud is Soulless
[1:40:51] <stfn893> Doesnt make any sense, but thats also japan right
[1:40:52] <VoxFoxWatch> That robot is just a car with legs.
[1:40:56] <%Triblade1992> The only thing that should be added from the Compilations of FF7 is the Zack Fair Death by Shinra army. That scene fixed A LOT of plot problems from the origiinal
[1:41:00] <Solokaldaka> poordeHey chat
[1:41:03] <DandyMackeroos> Japan is weird
[1:41:03] <Carnadan> what about a catgirl instead
[1:41:15] <nesbitt22> T is
[1:41:17] <+thackattack00> I think they've said you can get more ATB
[1:41:19] <+Heart0fInk> That's not just japan. but they do do that a LOT
[1:41:20] <+Arkanrais> give the child heterochromia and hair with 3 distinct colours to it
[1:41:22] <nesbitt22> it is
[1:41:27] <%Triblade1992> I think that will be integral. I've seen it
[1:41:35] <MrHappyFunshine> I wonder how Yuffie is gonna be in this game, probably twice as annoying.
[1:41:40] <rwells15> Super excited for the Rat Problem quest
[1:41:48] <codycurry52> Can't wait for that Aeirth/RedXlll scene.
[1:41:48] <nesbitt22> ATB will be alot like FF 13
[1:41:52] <Highwang> I hope we recruit Yuffie the exact same way
[1:41:57] <+Cucamabungabu> @PlagueOfGripes Are you going to do more videos with PeachSpit in the future? You guys have great chemistry.
[1:42:14] <DandyMackeroos> Peachspit is a very cool lady
[1:42:15] <%not_crabby> lol classic is below easy
[1:42:19] <%Triblade1992> @nesbitt22 That's what I love about this combat system. FF13 x KH combat are two things I can get behind
[1:42:43] <%not_crabby> wow that sounds awful
[1:42:46] <+Heart0fInk> Why does turbo easy = Classic?
[1:42:50] <nesbitt22> @Triblade1992 same
[1:43:17] <Artista_AF> so is supposed to be faux Turn Bassed
[1:43:26] <+HawkGoggles2> It's for enjoying the "Story"
[1:43:41] <PowerfulBlackGangs> Racism
[1:43:42] <Betofall> have you waited to see what the game over looks like?
[1:43:49] <VoxFoxWatch> Cheer100 Cheer100 Cheer100 you know, I just realized, with how light-hearted and goofy the original version of this game was, how are they gonna pull those scenes off in this “very serious version”? Imagine meeting the cat on the demon blob and Barret just going “YOU GONNA FUCKIN’ JOIN THIS TEAM OR WHAT, BITCH!?”. I have fears for this future.
[1:43:58] <ahaegotrigger> maybe its because barret is ranged
[1:44:03] <+Heart0fInk> Maybe their AI tells them to go after support first?
[1:44:27] <codycurry52> lol
[1:44:28] <DandyMackeroos> @voxfoxwatch Still seems a little light-hearted to me
[1:44:32] <SubjectX07x> That pause gave me a chuckle.
[1:44:35] <%not_crabby> LUL
[1:44:40] <+thackattack00> This demo already shows a bunch of goofy moments though
[1:44:44] <terminusterminal> Remember the time Cloud rides a dolphin up the side of a high voltage electric tower?
[1:44:48] <littlewillie610> We're still getting cross-dressing cloud, at least
[1:45:02] <+Cucamabungabu> @PlagueOfGripes Are you going to do more videos with PeachSpit in the future? You guys have great chemistry.
[1:45:03] <VoxFoxWatch> @dandymackeroos HIVE ME A GODDAMN HUG BEFORE I PUT MY BOOT STRAIGHT INTO YOUR HEART!!!”
[1:45:08] <Betofall> i figure it looks at the air and you hear punching
[1:45:17] <rwells15> Have they showed too much?
[1:45:42] <Betofall> maybe it was cid punching her? who could say? It's no ones fault
[1:45:54] <%Triblade1992> Also english Translations were a major issue with FF7
[1:46:01] <stfn893> Jessie looks hot now
[1:46:01] <VoxFoxWatch> Ah shit.
[1:46:06] <+Heart0fInk> All i care about is Cloud getting into a hot tub with like 10 buff gay dudes
[1:46:14] <bettysharkface> I've never played FF7, don't even know the plot, this is technically my first exposure to any of it.
[1:46:16] <bazz_tv> i had a 64 back then
[1:46:19] <Highwang> overexaggerated, like Jessie's libido
[1:46:20] <DandyMackeroos> @voxfoxwatch That’s just good ol Barret
[1:46:34] <VoxFoxWatch> @heart0fink OH FUCK, I FORGOT ABOUT THAT.
[1:46:48] <stfn893> This is the best looking game cutscene ever
[1:47:06] <+Arkanrais> I am not at all a fan of this anime jumping shite
[1:47:07] <Highwang> I hope they preserve Tifa and Cid loving snowboarding
[1:47:27] <DandyMackeroos> @arkanrais He’s a super solider man so it’s fine
[1:47:38] <Highwang> YEAH. I NEVER THOUGHT I'D HAVE TO WATCH OUT FOR FUKKEN FF7 SPOILERS
[1:47:39] <VoxFoxWatch> “Wee wee is what I refer to as my FUCKING SWORD.”
[1:47:48] <MrHappyFunshine> I remember being upset when Jessie died when i was a kid
[1:47:50] <bazz_tv> the only thing i know about FF games is through spoony reviews
[1:47:51] <DandyMackeroos> I didn’t dig Jessie’s old hair style
[1:48:03] <stfn893> Well Im never gonna play the remake so I, a young person will be stupid regardless
[1:48:03] <%not_crabby> just like p[eople saying gta 3 is the first gta
[1:48:11] <+Heart0fInk> https://cdn.gaystarnews.com/uploads/2019/06/Final_Fantasy_7_Fan_Scene.jpg
[1:48:14] <Artista_AF> despite the game having "remake" in the title i can see people saying that
[1:48:15] <+Heart0fInk> it's all i want
[1:48:16] <Betofall> nanaki's dad statue cries i swear kid
[1:48:18] <%Triblade1992> I think people will just call it FF7 Remake" or "FF7R"
[1:48:20] <%not_crabby> LUL
[1:48:26] <ahaegotrigger> Cool
[1:48:38] <DandyMackeroos> Now I’m just retroactively sad that Jessie gonna be a corpse.
[1:48:58] <+Draylle> "That was rough, Cloud. I'm still dead tho" :)
[1:48:59] <bettysharkface> BaBa stream?
[1:48:59] <VoxFoxWatch> “MAN I LOVE BEING ALIVE TO SNOWBOARD.”
[1:49:07] <Highwang> damn Plague
[1:49:13] <$doomp12> see plague, your first mistake was talking to people instead of going insane because of isolation.
