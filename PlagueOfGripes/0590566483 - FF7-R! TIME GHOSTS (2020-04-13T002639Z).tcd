[0:00:55] <+Jump_Guardian> hype for gripe
[0:01:10] <+Tyonidus> Plague my love for you is like a truck.
[0:01:31] <+TQuick101> ah yes, more death, excellent
[0:01:48] <zepie__> So glad I waited to see what OG fans thought of FF7 remake before I bought it
[0:01:56] <zepie__> and glad I didn't
[0:02:04] <Oleai> It's good, though.
[0:02:04] <+TQuick101> If you want to get the big bucks
[0:02:07] <+TQuick101> gotta show the feet
[0:02:19] <zepie__> just found out about the time ghosts and I'm livid
[0:02:49] <JohnClaggart> neat
[0:02:59] <+Tyonidus> yeah instead of screeching like retards about how the changes are fine and everybody who disagrees is wrong
[0:03:14] <ScreamLord> @PlagueOfGripes I started playing FF7-R and I'm surprised how quietly my PS4 Pro plays compared to other games like Monster Hunter.
[0:03:19] <+Jump_Guardian> draw Tifa crushing a watermelon with her thighs...for science
[0:03:20] <+Tyonidus> life is dumb I wish re3 remake was good oh well at least I have a good girlfriend these days
[0:04:23] <zepie__> remember when they said they we're gonna stay true to the orignal and that they were making it for the fans of the original? well what a load of LIES that was
[0:04:25] <cap_bon> So far FF7 Remake has been a rather enjoyable time thats sometimes interrupted by a naked clown running around
[0:04:47] <%Samex_Comex> Caw!
[0:05:03] <Tikigod784> I mean, naked Kefka running around would be an interesting change
[0:05:40] <Kampler21> ello chat
[0:05:47] <%Samex_Comex> Ha a nail bat
[0:05:58] <JohnClaggart> which weapon model do you like the best so far?
[0:06:20] <+silvery_cricket> Why do you think so many people like the time ghosts?
[0:06:22] <ralphwiggum16> HI PLAGUE
[0:06:27] <ralphwiggum16> I MISSED YOU SO MUCH
[0:06:27] <terminusterminal> Is Regen any good?
[0:06:35] <+JantDarvus> Time Jannies
[0:06:36] <law240> your elemental materia should be on your weapon
[0:06:40] <Tikigod784> they probably are excited by the changes
[0:06:58] <+Tyonidus> hot honestly
[0:06:58] <ahaegotrigger> awwwh
[0:07:18] <Tikigod784> desperately clinging to the idea that she'll live
[0:07:19] <ralphwiggum16> "this sounds creepy...but"
[0:07:25] <+JantDarvus> Plague, you know Rayman? The guy with the limbs that aren't actually attached to his body? That's her, she's his Sister.
[0:07:25] <zepie__> the "whispers of fate" are THE MOST contrived retcon I've ever seen
[0:07:26] <+Tyonidus> LOL FOILED AGAIN DARN YOU GAME DEVS
[0:07:27] <%Samex_Comex> Void Kreygasm
[0:07:32] <cherrycottontail> modeled it for costumes then
[0:07:36] <%JailShmixRemix> Void hggGasm
[0:07:37] <terminusterminal> INSIGHT GaINED
[0:07:42] <+zombieghost1337> Aerith's job skills allow any size
[0:07:46] <+TQuick101> But now I know and I'm lesser for it
[0:07:51] <+JantDarvus> I'm getting some serious Godhand vibes
[0:07:52] <ralphwiggum16> Plague I'm so disappointed in you.
[0:07:53] <%JailShmixRemix> You're greater
[0:08:06] <ralphwiggum16> I just beat godhand for the second time.
[0:08:07] <+Tyonidus> Whatever that sucks she's my princess and deserves to have pretty pink lacy panties on her cute lil butt
[0:08:09] <examplez0> Oh hey it's Bruce Campbell
[0:08:14] <ralphwiggum16> what an incredible game.
[0:08:27] <law240> Your elemental materia only works when it's equiped to your weapons
[0:08:37] <+silvery_cricket> Plague do you think any of the new characters actually matter?
[0:08:40] <+JantDarvus> These guys are getting me pretty hype not going to lie
[0:08:43] <+TQuick101> tyonidus what the fuck
[0:08:50] <+Tyonidus> @TQuick101 yes
[0:08:51] <law240> you have it on clouds armors
[0:09:00] <ralphwiggum16> they're pretty cool Jant
[0:09:41] <terminusterminal> Absorbs linked elemental damage seems rad as fuck
[0:09:46] <+JantDarvus> Final level for the armour is Absorb, that seems fantastic.
[0:09:48] <zepie__> Is that it? 23%? LAME
[0:09:50] <BillieNoMates> The materia link tends to be a Tifa thing on weapons for some reason
[0:10:00] <law240> your hardedge has a link and a the buster sword as a link too
[0:10:08] <examplez0> It's not a progression thing though
[0:10:10] <+TQuick101> Johnny lost like a bitch
[0:10:22] <examplez0> You only progress by talking to the guy in front of the big door
[0:10:26] <zepie__> in the orignal it was 50% then 100% and then you absorbed the damage
[0:10:35] <examplez0> The other room had a vending machine and a bench
[0:10:42] <+silvery_cricket> Plague Nomura doesn't think men and women can be friends, they are either big sisters, mothers, or love interests.
[0:10:43] <cap_bon> oh plague you should know your not allowed to go ahead without nomura permission by now
[0:10:55] <BillieNoMates> "Johnny, we fight robotic super weapons all the time. What do you think will happen?"
[0:11:29] <+Tyonidus> I unirionically agree with that Plague, on a scale of 1-10 how stupid do you think that makes me?
[0:11:35] <+JantDarvus> It's okay Plague, a Time Jannie will push you back if you start doing something wrong.
[0:11:42] <%kyh9> kyh9 subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 2 months! Is this the part where Jessie wins the CloudBowl?
[0:11:52] <ralphwiggum16> Lawyer plague and his "surprise consent" argument
[0:12:03] <+silvery_cricket> How come none of the time ghosts give a fuck about any of this shit, oh because Nomura wrote it.
[0:12:04] <%kyh9> The MP soaks right in through your ass form the paint
[0:12:11] <examplez0> Maybe "Potion" is a brand
[0:12:15] <cherrycottontail> why do people call them jannies
[0:12:18] <%Samex_Comex> Kid Rock?
[0:12:19] <cherrycottontail> what's that stand for
[0:12:21] <examplez0> 4chan meme
[0:12:23] <FrankysDream> ehh it's a video gamer bench
[0:12:23] <Xxnanshankingladdyxx> Butt chugging potions is par for the course really
[0:12:25] <+forgetme000> so potion is like a brand?
[0:12:25] <%kyh9> @cherrycottontail because they clean up shit
[0:12:25] <+JantDarvus> Potion appears to be a brand, yes. It's 'potion brand energy drink'
[0:12:26] <examplez0> Means "janitor"
[0:12:33] <cherrycottontail> Oh, janitor, i see
[0:12:55] <terminusterminal> GET OUT OF MY ARENA NORMIES REEEEEEE
[0:13:02] <zepie__> haha
[0:13:03] <DoostCola> arenas are my favorite sections in rpgs
[0:13:08] <+JantDarvus> Aerith, u mad?
[0:13:10] <+Tyonidus> Jesus I love her so much she's so pure.
[0:13:19] <ralphwiggum16> she could easily kill everyone in that audience
[0:13:20] <cherrycottontail> Time Janitor sounds pretty cool so I guess they had to degrade it huh
[0:13:20] <nepwar> aeirth mad x24
[0:13:24] <%Samex_Comex> Aeris hungers for flesh
[0:13:25] <+JantDarvus> Aerith is so pure and she's still going to rip a man's balls off.
[0:13:27] <BillieNoMates> Ahahaha
[0:13:28] <BillieNoMates> Nice
[0:13:32] <FrankysDream> i hate her stop telling me where i cant go
[0:13:35] <@Nightbot> Plague is a youtube animator and also streams at https://picarto.tv/Plague . Also: t-shirts! http://goo.gl/lze8QO
[0:13:36] <BillieNoMates> That was a bait and switch
[0:13:46] <terminusterminal> Does that no rule for man to man mean you can hit this place with a missile?
[0:13:52] <+JantDarvus> The amount of veiny, muscly detail on those dogs is uncomfortable
[0:14:19] <ralphwiggum16> on a scale from 1-10, how sexy do you find tentacle dog monsters Plague?
[0:14:36] <%Samex_Comex> It's the beastmaster!
[0:14:44] <+JantDarvus> Everything is better with spinning.
[0:14:46] <%kyh9> I'll try spinning, that's a good trick
[0:14:46] <+Tyonidus> holy balls that's the BIG NUMBER Cloud
[0:14:49] <+Punishedkaiger> I think he died with that
[0:14:51] <cap_bon> those dogs are jacked like kangaroos
[0:15:00] <mapimb> murderer
[0:15:00] <law240> Did you beat Shiva?
[0:15:04] <+pheblorganzardo> no more nail bat BibleThump
[0:15:04] <%kyh9> I WISH AERITH WAS MY WAIFU, who said that
[0:15:04] <+JantDarvus> Plague you just killed a man and also his bara dogs.
[0:15:06] <JohnClaggart> will aeris do hers if you stay as her?
[0:15:07] <stfn893> plagueFace
[0:15:12] <+JantDarvus> Bara tentacle dogs.
[0:15:18] <BillieNoMates> Johnny is a coward
[0:15:24] <BillieNoMates> WHAT RULES?
[0:15:29] <%kyh9> How many FF games have you played, Eli?
[0:15:31] <mapimb> sums this games
[0:15:50] <BillieNoMates> Dont worry, Clouds off to bed
[0:15:52] <+JantDarvus> Next match is just going to be a bomb sitting in the middle of the arena waiting for them.
[0:16:24] <+JantDarvus> Or like a firing line.
[0:16:27] <BillieNoMates> Can't farm the kids :(
[0:16:30] <Skeletonmanners> can you just farm the medals? they seemed like preset things
[0:16:31] <terminusterminal> Don't remind me about taht fucking kid I can't handle his existence
[0:16:43] <cap_bon> did you run into chadly again
[0:16:53] <+PleasantLee> alwayscheck the room after a fight where johnny was
[0:16:55] <bazz_tv> that's one ugly sword
[0:16:56] <+PleasantLee> to mock the losers
[0:17:02] <cherrycottontail> Why is X-2 your favorite final fantasy?
[0:17:06] <stfn893> That sounds rough
[0:17:07] <+JantDarvus> Oh wait can you mock the people you just stabbed to death?
[0:17:11] <+JantDarvus> Can you pet the defeated bara dogs?
[0:17:15] <%kyh9> I'm playing through the series for the first time, going through FF3 myself
[0:17:22] <nepwar> thats a weird ass situation
[0:17:28] <+Tyonidus> Plague has played every game that has ever existed he is a timeless immortal power lich who likes to draw voluptuous women who sometimes have fur.
[0:17:36] <stfn893> Thats weird because 15 is the best, no kappa
[0:17:46] <scarletbunnyknight> hey and how are you
[0:17:48] <%kyh9> "Hmm, this game seems like it was made by Idol fans"
[0:17:53] <Skeletonmanners> x-2 is just an enigma that it happened
[0:17:54] <examplez0> That was the point when they started selling out
[0:18:00] <stfn893> Was made for me
[0:18:03] <+JantDarvus> All I remember about X-2 was 'wait am I playing dress-up as a combat method'
[0:18:05] <Skeletonmanners> like just abandon all dignity
[0:18:11] <examplez0> Which one is your favourite?
[0:18:13] <+silvery_cricket> There was supposed to be an X-3
[0:18:16] <%kyh9> XV is all front-loaded
[0:18:20] <Skeletonmanners> 15 is messy and unfinished in parts
[0:18:20] <scarletbunnyknight> will you do another animation on pokemon @PlagueOfGripes
[0:18:23] <%kyh9> The first third is fun
[0:18:24] <BillieNoMates> 15 is the road trip game
[0:18:29] <+silvery_cricket> 15 is a okish game defended by Nomura fan boys
[0:18:30] <stfn893> Its a good game it only sucks ass
[0:18:31] <+RoByte2> The second half of 15 is literally on rails
[0:18:35] <Skeletonmanners> theres fun to be had but its very flawed
[0:18:45] <Kampler21> Whats your favorite ff? @PlagueOfGripes
[0:18:51] <+WaywardSera> Mercs practicing social distancing and face covering
[0:18:53] <%Samex_Comex> Look at these cool dudes
[0:18:56] <BillieNoMates> It's Pilaf and the gang
[0:19:07] <BillieNoMates> Except no giant mechs
[0:19:10] <+JantDarvus> Cloud just looks totally fucking lost.
[0:19:36] <examplez0> 7's mine too
[0:19:40] <+silvery_cricket> Cloud looks annoyed and bored
[0:19:47] <BillieNoMates> 8 normal guys vs 2 super soldiers
[0:19:47] <examplez0> Might have been 10 if it wasn't a straight line from beginning to end
[0:19:50] <BillieNoMates> WHO WILL WIN?
[0:19:52] <Skeletonmanners> 5's my fav cuz i just love the job system so much
[0:19:56] <+TQuick101> the underground Yakuza colosseum had more consistent rules
[0:20:12] <+JantDarvus> By the way, at any point did someone manage to tell Plague that Aeris has a charge attack with square as well?
[0:20:15] <law240> please link fire on your Hardedge
[0:20:34] <+silvery_cricket> Good thing Cloud isn't using his bare hands, considering he can twirl that giant sword with one hand.
[0:20:40] <+Tyonidus> Dear God I hate american VA's a whole lot most of the time, especially when they try REALLY hard to do a "anime" voice. It's so bad.
[0:20:59] <BillieNoMates> Everyone just flies everywhere
[0:21:04] <+TQuick101> cloud stop getting beat up
[0:21:07] <+JantDarvus> Cloud just got yeeted
[0:21:07] <BillieNoMates> Cloud just eats shit
[0:21:33] <terminusterminal> Fucking mass destruction out here
[0:21:35] <+JantDarvus> You should watch out for high winds
[0:22:16] <Skeletonmanners> priorities
[0:22:20] <BillieNoMates> Professional profiteers
[0:22:25] <hypersongi> They are muggers. That's kinda their whole thing.
[0:22:26] <Skeletonmanners> yea im getting cut to pieces but what if i get 5 dollars
[0:22:27] <+JantDarvus> That's actually kind of funny. The announcers did say about them robbing everyone.
[0:22:51] <law240> did you get Shiva?
[0:22:56] <BillieNoMates> Yes
[0:22:59] <BillieNoMates> and Fat Chocobo
[0:23:09] <+bharcoot> You can move the camera back during fights in the settings
[0:23:19] <+PleasantLee> remember to check the losers room in the waiting area
[0:23:21] <+silvery_cricket> IS THAT SAM ELLIOT
[0:23:25] <+WaywardSera> his palm...right
[0:23:25] <%Samex_Comex> Uh oh she's getting hot
[0:23:39] <nepwar> that big throbbing palm
[0:23:48] <+pheblorganzardo> "they still havent gotten away with anything they've stolen, since i can manipulate time and rewound that time they did"
[0:23:50] <JohnClaggart> the big dumb bee stinger
[0:23:56] <VeryTricky> Would a person who’s never played a FF game enjoy this one?
[0:24:14] <+silvery_cricket> "I am gonna put that boy in a dress"
[0:24:14] <+PleasantLee> andre?
[0:24:19] <examplez0> Probably not
[0:24:22] <law240> link fire on you Hardedge
[0:24:29] <examplez0> It's very different from what you expect from traditional FF
[0:24:29] <%bettysharkface> Morning
[0:24:48] <+TQuick101> of course they always call you up as soon as you sit down
[0:24:53] <+OnwardEch0> OH damn I have never seen plague's face, perfect match for my fanfics
[0:24:54] <examplez0> And like Plague says you need to have already played the original in order to fully grasp the story and characters
[0:25:04] <+HawkGoggles2> Just fight this house, it's normal here.
[0:25:07] <Jflaskd13> Isn't it just mako poison does weird shit
[0:25:07] <BillieNoMates> Because Nomura demands it
[0:25:10] <Skeletonmanners> some of the goofy robots now being just junked garbage makes sense
[0:25:11] <BillieNoMates> ^
[0:25:18] <Skeletonmanners> cuz why else would a random tube on legs exist
[0:25:21] <BillieNoMates> Its just MAKO 99% of the time
[0:25:24] <VeryTricky> eski66Isee
[0:25:29] <Skeletonmanners> rent?
[0:25:29] <+JantDarvus> Plague, don't forget to check the losers room again. Also, has someone already mentioned to you that you can hold down the square button with Aerith as well as single presses?
[0:25:30] <JohnClaggart> probably fire
[0:25:45] <FrankysDream> what could possibly be the reason for the triceratops tank?
[0:26:02] <terminusterminal> Chapter 7 bankruptcy?
[0:26:13] <+OnwardEch0> Style
[0:26:35] <Jflaskd13> beast hate fire, humans fire and bio, fliers hate Aero, ice for bugs and creatures I think thunder for robos
[0:26:36] <+PleasantLee> Hellhouse is pretty tough fight, but just take your time and fight smart, not mashy
[0:26:44] <terminusterminal> Have you been getting a lot of use out of ATB boost?
[0:27:09] <examplez0> Make sure you equip all four elements for the Hellhouse fight
[0:27:26] <Skeletonmanners> skill explanations in this are pretty bad
[0:27:33] <Skeletonmanners> or quests for that matter
[0:27:38] <law240> First Strike is good
[0:27:53] <examplez0> Refocus works like a limit break
[0:28:05] <examplez0> And it adds an extra ATB bar and makes the gauge fill up faster
[0:28:07] <+JantDarvus> 'Effect: Partition your ATB gauge into three segments, allowing for faster charge accumulation.'
[0:28:09] <LunarRemix> You to link Synergy to make it work, did you do that?
[0:28:14] <LunarRemix> You have to*
[0:28:45] <Hellarussian> is this a side quest?
[0:28:54] <examplez0> You're gonna need to equip all four elements for this fight
[0:29:00] <+PleasantLee> did you check the losers room?
[0:29:05] <+JantDarvus> He did not :<
[0:29:08] <+PleasantLee> woops
[0:29:19] <law240> You gotta link it
[0:29:26] <examplez0> Elemental weakness plays a huge part in this fight
[0:29:28] <LunarRemix> AKA terrorist boy!
[0:29:32] <mapimb> whats in the losers room
[0:29:36] <+JantDarvus> Losers
[0:29:36] <Skeletonmanners> i like how quickly the announcers went from shittalk to hype talk
[0:29:43] <snowmanse> It's like the ending to Rocky IV
[0:29:44] <+PleasantLee> lightning for this fight
[0:30:10] <+PleasantLee> jebaited
[0:30:11] <examplez0> Oh whoops not this fight
[0:30:14] <examplez0> I meant the next one
[0:30:19] <examplez0> Sorry wrong fight
[0:30:22] <%Samex_Comex> Go Sweepy!
[0:30:27] <+PleasantLee> ahahahha
[0:30:33] <Jflaskd13> LUL that
[0:30:39] <+PleasantLee> I love the losers room after this fight, cracked me the fuck up
[0:31:09] <+JantDarvus> Wait, are the robots in the losers room?
[0:31:11] <Skeletonmanners> MOOOOORPH
[0:31:13] <BillieNoMates> THIS ONES FOR YOU, MORPH
[0:31:14] <examplez0> Yes
[0:31:23] <examplez0> Their junk parts are lying there
[0:31:31] <+JantDarvus> kek also holy shit he's just dismantling these poor guys
[0:31:48] <examplez0> Take out Cutty first
[0:32:08] <examplez0> Yeah it does
[0:32:08] <Jflaskd13> prolly
[0:32:14] <BillieNoMates> less damage but it hits all parts doesnt it?
[0:32:17] <examplez0> Only 60% efficiency for the first level
[0:32:22] <+JantDarvus> If you take out sweepy first, cutty will take his power and gain an electric butt smash.
[0:32:30] <+PleasantLee> it doesnt even make sense because their parts are bigger than the door
[0:32:30] <Jflaskd13> aerith's double cast is only a 1.5 power
[0:32:57] <%Samex_Comex> Nooo Sweepy!
[0:33:09] <snowmanse> I hope the loser's room is just Chocobo Sam crying over robot parts
[0:33:39] <nepwar> LUL
[0:33:41] <mapimb> so animie
[0:33:47] <@Nightbot> Plague is a youtube animator and also streams at https://picarto.tv/Plague . Also: t-shirts! http://goo.gl/lze8QO

[0:33:56] <%Samex_Comex> Who's this boy band?
[0:34:00] <+PleasantLee> I should start wearing jrock garbage clothes
[0:34:01] <BillieNoMates> Was he in FF7?
[0:34:05] <examplez0> You'd better rest before the next one
[0:34:09] <LunarRemix> They are really building Corneo to be something instead of just a bald fat guy
[0:34:14] <examplez0> No he wasn't
[0:34:20] <+PleasantLee> I love your room gets more flowers and shit for winning
[0:34:28] <examplez0> Cowboy man was
[0:34:31] <examplez0> But he had no lines
[0:34:38] <terminusterminal> You need all four elements for this fight?
[0:34:41] <%Samex_Comex> Oh god!
[0:34:42] <BillieNoMates> Wut
[0:34:42] <examplez0> He's the one who was driving the carriage carrying Tifa
[0:34:43] <+TQuick101> oh
[0:34:48] <+PleasantLee> OH MAN
[0:34:51] <examplez0> Yes this is the one
[0:34:51] <+PleasantLee> I didnt even think
[0:34:55] <SuperVaderMan> Madam pls
[0:34:55] <Futurecity10> God she's hot
[0:34:55] <law240> LUL
[0:34:57] <reinbachthe3rd> Madam M. Kreygasm
[0:34:58] <examplez0> And the assess materia
[0:34:59] <arran_throttle> oh i like her
[0:35:00] <+PleasantLee> when cid shows up he'll swear up a storm
[0:35:07] <BillieNoMates> Clouds gonna to bottom for Corneo so hard
[0:35:09] <nepwar> did not expect that much swearing
[0:35:11] <+PleasantLee> LOSERS ROOM!!!!!!!
[0:35:13] <Sir_Carl> The fucked-up lipsyncing is really bothering me
[0:35:13] <Futurecity10> God I love Japanese women
[0:35:18] <TheWe4pon> i like madam M
[0:35:36] <+OnwardEch0> that shoulder reveal is great
[0:35:43] <Skeletonmanners> loser room?
[0:35:45] <+JantDarvus> Holy shit the congratulations display
[0:35:47] <Jflaskd13> better than Libra
[0:35:55] <GiygasDrillBreak> it was SENSE in the original game

[0:36:35] <+Fatemaster> He is wallowing in defeat.
[0:36:57] <law240> Equip Assess
[0:36:58] <examplez0> That's the Unreal Engine for you

[0:37:17] <azon2021> he accepting help?
[0:37:27] <+Fatemaster> Chocobo man should have invested in Cybrids. Kappa
[0:37:31] <+PleasantLee> You need Fire, Ice, Wind and Lightning
[0:37:35] <dmysta3000> Might be best to remove the Elemental Materia
[0:37:46] <azon2021> def bring sleep
[0:38:02] <law240> you have 2 elemental
[0:38:02] <+PleasantLee> DO NOT LINK MAGIC MATERIA TO ELEMENT SUPPORT MATERIA
[0:38:20] <terminusterminal> Seriously what the heck is Manaward?
[0:38:26] <terminusterminal> Is it shell?
[0:38:32] <Berendenn> yes
[0:38:34] <+PleasantLee> I did and clouds melee didnt work for most of the fight
[0:38:45] <law240> Arieth has a link on her weapon

[0:39:53] <mapimb> nooo
[0:39:56] <+PartyTimeAustin> I would want to assess here
[0:39:59] <reinbachthe3rd> All you can do is try, and see what happens.
[0:40:09] <examplez0> Yeah it's a good idea to have assess for this fight
[0:40:10] <+PleasantLee> I cant wait for the bit with the door
[0:40:25] <dmysta3000> This fight is really tough
[0:41:05] <+PleasantLee> as soon as this fight is over I'm off, no spoilers for me
[0:41:14] <terminusterminal> This was a fast 180
[0:41:24] <Jflaskd13> doodThirst
[0:41:27] <terminusterminal> Considering they were like "Normies get out" before.
[0:41:30] <$studleydoorite> I didn't know this game had Twitch integration
[0:41:33] <+TQuick101> the chat is in the game!
[0:41:36] <+PleasantLee> SCAN HELLHOUSE AND READ
[0:41:36] <+WaywardSera> Oh look it's half of every FF7 fan condensed into a character
[0:41:40] <DerpioParty> Heck House
[0:41:49] <+UnwoundCaesar70> HELLHOUSE
[0:41:50] <Berendenn> meeeemes
[0:41:58] <+ATorL> The House's parents were killed by a human, so now he's out for revenge.
[0:42:14] <+PleasantLee> scan, scan, scan, scan
[0:42:18] <ahaegotrigger> LUL Gold
[0:42:25] <dmysta3000> Its probably the weirdest enemy in FF
[0:42:28] <SuperVaderMan> It's more Hellish than a regular house PogChamp
[0:42:32] <ahaegotrigger> the house is a decpticon
[0:42:33] <sosuke5> Cloud: "It's some sort of hell...house
[0:42:35] <+PleasantLee> fucking love this fight, made with love
[0:42:41] <Skeletonmanners> i love that they made it a full on boss instead of a random encounter
[0:42:41] <+ATorL> I've got to admit, I have never seen a house fight in an arena,
[0:42:44] <+PleasantLee> pay attention to the announcers too
[0:42:46] <Sokumotanaka> dont let pat watch this stream!
[0:42:47] <Futurecity10> I cant wait for Triceritops
[0:42:51] <Skeletonmanners> homing chairs lol
[0:42:51] <+WaywardSera> Chair Missiles LUL
[0:42:52] <+PleasantLee> YUPPPP
[0:42:53] <examplez0> It's on fire so use ice
[0:42:56] <+Pyr0_Fr0st> Know about Tankceratops?
[0:42:56] <+PleasantLee> CHAIR MISSILES
[0:42:57] <BillieNoMates> FURNITURE ATTAAAAAAAAAAAAACK
[0:43:05] <snowmanse> The weirdest enemy is the woman that turns you into frogs until you reset the game because she won't kill you
[0:43:08] <@dcn2049> this is a weird place to come in to
[0:43:09] <BTRNDL> Ying and Yang are weirdos too
[0:43:14] <examplez0> Ice magic bro
[0:43:14] <+ATorL> Okay this might be cool.
[0:43:15] <%Samex_Comex> What the fuck is that!?
[0:43:17] <+Fatemaster> If only This Old House had featured Hell House.
[0:43:18] <+PleasantLee> SCAN
[0:43:20] <Sokumotanaka> Monster house 2
[0:43:30] <+ATorL> The house jumped.
[0:43:30] <terminusterminal> That house is agile as fuck
[0:43:36] <examplez0> Now use Wind magic
[0:43:38] <+TQuick101> oh man I expected that jump to be an aoe
[0:43:49] <+PleasantLee> I LOVE THAT DESCRIPTION
[0:43:59] <@dcn2049> what the hell
[0:44:00] <wannabemoogle> Look at those drops
[0:44:07] <dmysta3000> "Its just a house bro"
[0:44:08] <Skeletonmanners> "We don't know what devs thought at the time"
[0:44:10] <SuperVaderMan> GOD HOUSE
[0:44:11] <+ATorL> "It's a fucking house."
[0:44:11] <+WaywardSera> Developers: We don't even know why this exists. But it's here!
[0:44:13] <+eanscrale> "look man, it's a house"
[0:44:17] <+TQuick101> "I mean, shit, we don't fuckin' know how he did it. Here it is."
[0:44:21] <Jflaskd13> doodMako
[0:44:23] <wannabemoogle> wot
[0:44:23] <terminusterminal> SUMMON UP THE POWER OF THE GOD HOUSE
[0:44:25] <+HawkGoggles2> This house is a creature of chaos, it takes many forms.
[0:44:26] <LunarRemix> It has a super mode lol wtf
[0:44:28] <Skeletonmanners> fucking VIDEO GAMES
[0:44:30] <JohnClaggart> super saiyajin god house
[0:44:31] <+UnwoundCaesar70> GODHOUSE?!
[0:44:31] <+PleasantLee> ROBOT GOD HOOOOOOUSE!
[0:44:33] <Futurecity10> They are straight taking the piss with this
[0:44:40] <+PleasantLee> its the best
[0:44:46] <oshkeet41> God House: Aeris hops into her church and it grows legs and arms and starts a mecha fight
[0:44:48] <GeltonZ> So it turns into a church?
[0:44:54] <+ATorL> It drops stuffed animals?
[0:45:09] <+WaywardSera> Fuzzy Wuzzy? LUL
[0:45:10] <+PleasantLee> yes
[0:45:13] <+PleasantLee> and they explode
[0:45:16] <reinbachthe3rd> Do you have Bio? That could cause some nice DoT.
[0:45:31] <+ATorL> They're coming from the house, duh.
[0:46:13] <terminusterminal> I wish Hell House joined the party.
[0:46:17] <wannabemoogle> I love the lil foundation feet
[0:46:28] <+ATorL> have you ever been body slammed by a house? Cloud has.
[0:46:47] <+PleasantLee> I LOVE THOSE CHAIRS
[0:46:57] <+PleasantLee> its like harry potter shit if it was cool
[0:46:59] <terminusterminal> Is regen any good?
[0:47:00] <examplez0> The lack of i-franes really sucks
[0:47:19] <examplez0> *i-frames
[0:47:24] <+ATorL> Behold, my final form!
[0:47:28] <+Fatemaster> Rooboot Houuse!
[0:47:33] <BillieNoMates> ahahahaha
[0:47:34] <%Samex_Comex> Oh dear god!
[0:47:35] <BillieNoMates> This boss
[0:47:36] <+TQuick101> wow
[0:47:37] <+PleasantLee> only if HellHouse leaves enough of you to turn into a woman
[0:47:38] <BillieNoMates> Is amazing
[0:47:39] <azon2021> I frames woulda been nice af
[0:47:42] <+WaywardSera> that's some Nier Automata bullshit right there
[0:47:42] <wannabemoogle> Robot chicken house
[0:47:55] <dmysta3000> You can block its charging attack
[0:47:59] <BillieNoMates> Awwwww its a mech?
[0:48:00] <snowmanse> I saw someone spend 20 minutes on this, and the announcers had fresh dialogue for the entirety of it
[0:48:05] <examplez0> Yeah use chocobo chick
[0:48:07] <BillieNoMates> Thats boring
[0:48:09] <examplez0> Then use summon ability
[0:48:24] <+PleasantLee> chocobo chick does all elements
[0:48:25] <+arancet> @PlagueOfGripes your bottom overlay bar is black... is it meant to be?
[0:48:25] <terminusterminal> Chocobo chick summon ability can hit every element
[0:48:38] <BillieNoMates> Abortion chocobo gooooooooooo
[0:48:45] <BillieNoMates> He just ate cloud
[0:48:47] <examplez0> He's on fire now
[0:48:50] <%Samex_Comex> It ate him!
[0:48:50] <+PleasantLee> heheheh
[0:48:50] <BillieNoMates> for 51 damage
[0:48:53] <examplez0> Or he was
[0:49:01] <law240> Assess
[0:49:12] <ckkc1> Chocobortion
[0:49:13] <+PleasantLee> you can knock your party member out of it if you use an ability attack on it
[0:49:13] <Jflaskd13> use the touch pad
[0:49:19] <BillieNoMates> He's on fire. That means use Blizzard
[0:49:21] <examplez0> He doesn't have assess equip
[0:49:23] <BillieNoMates> Not use fire LUL
[0:49:24] <Berendenn> hit touch pad to look at scan again
[0:49:46] <BillieNoMates> House fart
[0:49:57] <+TQuick101> I'm starting to think Cloud likes getting hit
[0:50:03] <+HawkGoggles2> This is the Aerith fight. Magic is the way to go.
[0:50:17] <+WaywardSera> Fuzzy Wuzzy and Mr. Cuddlesworth LUL
[0:50:18] <Skeletonmanners> Mr Cuddlesworth lol
[0:50:19] <terminusterminal> Damn if only we had steal
[0:50:23] <dmysta3000> They're bombs I think
[0:50:24] <+PleasantLee> THEY'RE BOMBS
[0:50:34] <+Neoripo> Ye, explosives
[0:51:17] <examplez0> Use wind
[0:51:18] <terminusterminal> What the Hell House is going on?
[0:51:41] <+PleasantLee> hehehehe
[0:51:52] <Skeletonmanners> GOD HOUSE MODE
[0:52:02] <+PleasantLee> if you are far enough away and start dodge rolling or running to the side you can avoid the suck
[0:52:10] <+lapislafooly> lapislafooly subscribed with Twitch Prime. 
[0:52:36] <examplez0> It's weird since you need physical attacks to build ATB but you can't use physical attacks right now
[0:53:18] <+PleasantLee> GOD HOUSE
[0:53:33] <+jetjagger222> iddqd house
[0:54:15] <Berendenn> this is probably the worst fight in the game
[0:54:17] <wannabemoogle> I just realized it kinda looks like a tonberry face
[0:54:18] <mapimb> this is very much a mostly aerith fight huh
[0:54:22] <examplez0> Block
[0:54:26] <+Nekun> i was just about to say that @Berendenn
[0:54:30] <+Nekun> i literally is
[0:54:40] <+Nekun> just hit credits a couple minutes ago here
[0:54:45] <snowmanse> Check the targets when it is in god mode
[0:54:53] <arran_throttle> well.. dah, its a god mode
[0:55:02] <hypersongi> Its a patience game. Yay
[0:55:04] <examplez0> If only you had debarrier
[0:55:04] <ckkc1> we've got trouble
[0:55:17] <ckkc1> right here in FF city
[0:55:30] <%CyberDingus> CHAT HOW MUCH DID I MISS?
[0:55:32] <+RaveBV> That sounds more like a dumb padding mechanic to make a boss fight longer than it should be.
[0:55:38] <ckkc1> with a capital T that rhymes with P that stands for PADDING
[0:55:53] <snowmanse> try casting a spell so you can check targets when the shield is up
[0:56:25] <+Nekun> its the worst fight in the game
[0:56:35] <+Nekun> more so if you came in with 1 or 2 elements only
[0:56:46] <Berendenn> Bio was the biggest help
[0:56:47] <azon2021> i think you can bind it when the shield is down
[0:57:00] <arkv01> just in time for hellhouse, aw yeeea
[0:57:16] <+PleasantLee> just got to wait for it to be weak to an element again and then attack right away so its god mode doesnt block your magic
[0:57:25] <+PleasantLee> use god mode to stay healthy
[0:57:41] <Berendenn> I had like 2 elements or something just had to wait for it to poison to death
[0:57:54] <mapimb> i feel your overusing your dodge a bit
[0:58:02] <%hgtarras> hgtarras subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 16 months, currently on a 1 month streak! Aeris is not dying fast wow
[0:58:10] <+PleasantLee> if you use an ability attack you'll make hellhouse spit out your teammate
[0:58:51] <mapimb> cloud is just useless in this fight
[0:58:54] <law240> nope
[0:58:56] <Berendenn> that eyeroll is the big fucking mood of this fight
[0:59:04] <+jetjagger222> LUL
[0:59:07] <+Nekun> LOL
[0:59:13] <+PleasantLee> dont wait, attack it as soon as its weak to element again
[0:59:20] <SirMcSlushy> This seems pretty dumb. Maybe literally use Cloud as bait and let the house eat him, and then spellcast when hes inside?
[0:59:20] <+jetjagger222> i was totally expecting that to hit
[0:59:22] <+jetjagger222> but no
[0:59:23] <law240> after an element attack like that it goes god mode
[0:59:28] <SilverRoddo> Did i miss anymore Roche appearances?
[0:59:37] <+PleasantLee> no
[0:59:48] <+pheblorganzardo> we started this stream thinking plague would have an easier time since he ground for a while
[0:59:50] <+PleasantLee> havent seen him since the bike battle and the boss fight
[0:59:51] <Jflaskd13> doodRage
[0:59:51] <+pheblorganzardo> we were wrong
[0:59:59] <+RaveBV> It's called padding, Plague.
[1:00:07] <SuperVaderMan> The timing is way too tight for how big the delay is between input and attack
[1:00:08] <SirMcSlushy> I feel like its reactively activating it, and ya need to find the right moments to do it without him reacting.
[1:00:12] <%caramello_man> it's not plague having trouble, it's that the fight is dumb
[1:00:12] <+RaveBV> No use complaining about something meant to waste your time and make it feel like a boss is harder than it is.
[1:00:14] <Berendenn> spoilers you cannot attack the arms :D
[1:00:21] <+RaveBV> It's intentional :/
[1:00:42] <snowmanse> @Berendenn that is the entire point of the shield, is attack arms when shield is up
[1:00:47] <+PleasantLee> dont worry about the ward, if you're not in it when its god mode is off it take stoo much time to get in it
[1:00:51] <+thefakeh> LuL
[1:00:53] <SilverRoddo> Thanks, seeing Eli die inside when that-man shows up, is gold.
[1:00:54] <BillieNoMates> LUL
[1:00:54] <Jflaskd13> LUL
[1:00:56] <mapimb> loool
[1:00:59] <SirMcSlushy> Yeah i'm pretty sure its reactive.
[1:01:01] <law240> it already attacked LUL
[1:01:06] <+jetjagger222> woolieREMEMBERS
[1:01:06] <Berendenn> problem is clouds swing is so big it bounces off anyway when you hit the arms
[1:01:07] <snowmanse> Magic the arms when shield is up and it breaks the shield.
[1:01:11] <azon2021> recommended level: 40
[1:01:17] <Jflaskd13> you must do it during the attack it seems
[1:01:18] <+WaywardSera> son of a bitch...
[1:01:29] <BillieNoMates> Ill show you Im extremely flammable
[1:01:39] <%CyberDingus> try abilities?
[1:01:43] <BillieNoMates> You have to ATB it as a counter
[1:01:56] <mapimb> there must be an easy way to do this right?
[1:02:00] <+FunkyRot> uggo house
[1:02:10] <+Nekun> what i dont get is why the arm is targetable, cant even hit it cause of god mode or bounce
[1:02:12] <arkv01> hell house could be more demonic
[1:02:18] <arkv01> give it gross ass tentacles
[1:02:19] <law240> it already attacked
[1:02:26] <SilverRoddo> I feel, there is a heaven house.
[1:02:27] <+PleasantLee> You can make Hell House spit your party member out if you use an ability attack on it
[1:02:34] <+FunkyRot> give hell house an ass
[1:02:37] <+FunkyRot> a fat one
[1:02:49] <+jetjagger222> it missed?
[1:02:50] <+Nekun> you are invincible in Limits
[1:02:53] <arran_throttle> crazy talk LOL
[1:02:59] <+WaywardSera> super armored through the hit
[1:03:00] <ScreamLord> Crazy Talk?
[1:03:02] <arkv01> i-frame LBs
[1:03:29] <law240> BRUH
[1:03:35] <law240> you're timing is oof
[1:03:37] <arran_throttle> Pat asleep, Crazy Talk stand moves to Plague
[1:03:45] <+PleasantLee> you have to cast magic as soon as its god mode is off
[1:03:50] <Berendenn> I honestly found that low rank spells are vastly superior
[1:04:02] <Berendenn> as far as damage ->mp was concerned
[1:04:07] <+azure22900> smash it
[1:04:11] <+Nekun> when its prime you can hit it normally
[1:04:25] <mapimb> almost staggered
[1:04:32] <+azure22900> when pressure is up just attack as much as possible
[1:04:35] <BillieNoMates> it turns it off when it attacks
[1:05:10] <+jetjagger222> 1100 ih
[1:05:17] <+PleasantLee> I can hear a chair hitting cloud
[1:05:27] <+PleasantLee> LIMIT BREAK
[1:05:31] <SilverRoddo> Small victories
[1:05:34] <+Nekun> LOL
[1:05:35] <BillieNoMates> just bust your nut on it
[1:05:37] <law240> LUL
[1:05:44] <+PleasantLee> woooooow
[1:05:45] <Berendenn> best fight
[1:05:45] <+jetjagger222> WOW
[1:05:46] <mapimb> wow
[1:05:47] <SirMcSlushy> pff
[1:05:48] <TheWe4pon> wooooow this fucking fight
[1:05:49] <terminusterminal> Heavensward?
[1:05:50] <BlueSpartan119> unfortunate
[1:05:52] <SuperVaderMan> Ate the stagger and limit break with a cutscene wooooowwww
[1:05:54] <+TQuick101> oooooo
[1:05:56] <azon2021> 10/10 boss
[1:06:00] <+HawkGoggles2> Cinematic dynamic gameplay everybody.
[1:06:01] <+jetjagger222> jeez that sucks
[1:06:01] <%CyberDingus> @PlagueOfGripes chill Eli. Chill.
[1:06:07] <+Nekun> it was a phase shift
[1:06:07] <mapimb> fucking idiot programming
[1:06:13] <+Nekun> unfortunate timing lol
[1:06:14] <+TQuick101> @CyberDingus no he has a right to be pissed
[1:06:14] <+Jumpie8> grtF
[1:06:20] <+forgetme000> i hate the phase changes do that in this game
[1:06:22] <JohnClaggart> GOAT game
[1:06:41] <mapimb> is that a glitch?
[1:06:47] <arkv01> not ALLOWED PunOko
[1:06:52] <JohnClaggart> it's a hp trigger
[1:06:52] <mr_slaide> WE LOVE YOU, PLAGUE!
[1:06:52] <+Nekun> it wasnt a glitch
[1:06:56] <+Nekun> phase shift
[1:07:01] <BillieNoMates> no. every boss with phases does this
[1:07:02] <ahaegotrigger> LUL
[1:07:04] <TheLucidChiba> Very much hate that as well
[1:07:06] <azon2021> didnt even die yet, thats imprressive
[1:07:09] <+PleasantLee> lightning
[1:07:12] <+forgetme000> it happens in every fight when the boss changes phases
[1:07:15] <%CyberDingus> It is blasting the viewers
[1:07:15] <+PleasantLee> it'll be close
[1:07:18] <+jetjagger222> attemptimg to stomp you
[1:07:18] <mapimb> SO FLASHY
[1:07:24] <mapimb> SO COOL
[1:07:25] <SirMcSlushy> Realized part way through its windows change color based on its element weakness
[1:07:43] <+PleasantLee> too slow
[1:07:47] <arkv01> problem is it looks like its always on fire
[1:07:47] <law240> it's gonna swap
[1:07:59] <+azure22900> look at the windows please it's all color coded
[1:08:16] <mr_slaide> It always does that.
[1:08:18] <BillieNoMates> you can spam the drain in this fight during god house mode]#
[1:08:22] <mapimb> why is cloud even here
[1:08:34] <Berendenn> for items
[1:08:34] <+PleasantLee> to do limit breaks
[1:08:40] <$studleydoorite> I liked Hell House before it sold out and got all those rocket thrusters
[1:08:45] <arkv01> is it invulnerable to summons too?
[1:08:55] <$jamarartdoodles> give her mp
[1:08:57] <+forgetme000> thats how it works exactly the enemies priorities the player Character
[1:09:01] <+PleasantLee> cloud is good for getting aeris out of the house
[1:09:08] <SilverRoddo> Dean Plague: “Heeeeell Hoooouse!”
[1:09:18] <+PleasantLee> triple slash spits them up good
[1:09:21] <Kafeigintou> Tifa > Airith
[1:09:40] <arkv01> get in muh belleh
[1:09:42] <TheLucidChiba> I would have really loved a proper jrpg combat system instead of this honestly
[1:09:42] <Berendenn> the bosses auto targetting the PC really makes using aerith suck
[1:09:44] <%CyberDingus> try ability?
[1:10:04] <+whiskywolfe> Bring the house down! Raise the roof! Blow the doors off!
[1:10:09] <+PleasantLee> I love the annoncers know your move names
[1:10:26] <SirMcSlushy> Well its clearly using Lightning
[1:10:33] <SirMcSlushy> By the sparks and blue glow
[1:10:33] <Berendenn> aero missed because it was moving lol
[1:10:50] <BillieNoMates> I dont know if stagger is based on damage
[1:10:57] <mapimb> spells shouldnt fucking miss
[1:11:00] <BillieNoMates> or just on successful fulfillment of critera
[1:11:20] <TheLucidChiba> If a move can't be aimed by a player then it shouldn't be able to miss
[1:11:22] <Berendenn> aero and blizzard have the issue of being delayed explosions
[1:11:25] <+Fatemaster> Rumor has it that Hell House only gets basic cable packages.
[1:11:27] <Berendenn> always misses if enemies move even a bit
[1:11:38] <+PleasantLee> ALMOST
[1:12:01] <snowmanse> Thundara doesn't have to travel and can't miss is my guess.
[1:12:02] <+jetjagger222> might be faster
[1:12:02] <+forgetme000> this seems like a fight designed to disadvantage cloud and force you to play Areth
[1:12:14] <+Silver_Ogre> A lot of machine enemies maybe?
[1:12:17] <cherrycottontail> It's always been like that
[1:12:19] <+PleasantLee> maybe you have something equiped that reduces the mana cost?
[1:12:24] <cap_bon> how long has this fight been going on
[1:12:37] <mapimb> imagine if cloud went in alone
[1:12:45] <azon2021> blizzard and aero have a delay. they should be way cheaper
[1:12:53] <+BurkeBigsby> Invulnerable enemies ate fun though. atpRtsd
[1:13:10] <%CyberDingus> YAAAY
[1:13:12] <arkv01> we DUD IT
[1:13:13] <+TQuick101> nice
[1:13:16] <+PleasantLee> AHHAHAHAH
[1:13:20] <JohnClaggart> chat did it
[1:13:25] <BlueSpartan119> prime example of why immunity phases are annoying
[1:13:29] <+TQuick101> oh sure now cloud's sword is effective
[1:13:30] <Berendenn> Cutscene cloud gets to attack
[1:13:32] <+PleasantLee> you just did the fight wrong
[1:13:33] <@Nightbot> Plague is a youtube animator and also streams at https://picarto.tv/Plague . Also: t-shirts! http://goo.gl/lze8QO
[1:13:36] <+HawkGoggles2> That ending isn't right, Cloud didn't do shit.
[1:13:39] <snowmanse> So to spoil what you were missing, you cast a spell at the arms when the shield is up and it breaks the shield and stuns him
[1:13:55] <terrasonny1> Chat did all the work :)
[1:13:56] <cap_bon> lets make out on the burning wreckage
[1:14:06] <+PleasantLee> you need to cast the low level magic as soon as its out of god mode. if you wait too long then you dont have enough time
[1:14:07] <mapimb> i did that
[1:14:08] <arkv01> that boy... im gonna fukk him
[1:14:12] <APsaull> Battle puzzle
[1:14:15] <mapimb> that was me
[1:14:16] <%CyberDingus> Her potential fuck toy survived!
[1:14:19] <%CyberDingus> Yay
[1:14:23] <+PleasantLee> YOU DID THE FIGHT WRONG
[1:14:35] <arkv01> NO YOU DID
[1:14:38] <TheWe4pon> @PlagueOfGripes save
[1:14:40] <arkv01> but then who was house
[1:14:46] <%Rezca> I like that shirt
[1:14:50] <mapimb> NO DO THE FIGHT AGAIN
[1:14:52] <+PleasantLee> now buy an explosive teddy and leave
[1:15:02] <mapimb> DO IT PROPERLY
[1:15:11] <notanegg8> !uptime
[1:15:11] <@Nightbot> 1 hour 15 minutes 21 seconds
[1:15:26] <thecrazyanbu> The souvenier shop is nothing but explosives
[1:15:40] <@dcn2049> haha
[1:15:42] <ahaegotrigger> LUL
[1:15:44] <+TQuick101> take me seriously weeeeh
[1:15:45] <notanegg8> playing this game is a fight all its own
[1:15:48] <+PleasantLee> now its my time to go because you've caught up with me. I really need to haul ass
[1:15:50] <oshkeet41> Hell House but with a higher morgage
[1:15:59] <hypersongi> The whole fight. But this time only God House Mode.
[1:16:07] <+HawkGoggles2> Hard mode: Hell House but also it's residents.
[1:16:11] <+Fatemaster> You've experience Hell House, now experience Hell's Kitchen!
[1:16:19] <munchkay> GodHouse weak to Quit
[1:16:25] <mapimb> this would have been easier with the rent materia
[1:16:33] <+PleasantLee> good night everybody
[1:16:41] <law240> did you get the item
[1:16:42] <Berendenn> meme boss
[1:16:43] <JohnClaggart> 10 ap, 650 exp
[1:16:54] <+BurkeBigsby> Yeah, but now you can say you fought a house.
[1:17:27] <law240> which bear did you get?
[1:17:48] <arkv01> I would've liked hell house as a regular encounter in the highway area where it was in OG, get cloud asking the fuck is going on with this city
[1:18:06] <Berendenn> Prayer is super strong in this game weirdly
[1:18:11] <@Nightbot> @tokenreefer -> Let's rock! [stop spamming emotes] [warning]
[1:18:23] <SirMcSlushy> What is this gay cowboy
[1:18:25] <mapimb> why did we do that
[1:18:30] <%CyberDingus> "Madam M said you should go to her place"
[1:18:39] <%CyberDingus> "Madam M wants some extra"
[1:18:42] <+HawkGoggles2> You wanna fight hell house again? Kappa
[1:18:56] <tokenreefer> plagueFace
[1:19:08] <%CyberDingus> Does "M" stands for 'Mistress' or 'Mommy' ? :v
[1:19:08] <+HawkGoggles2> Forced hard mode.
[1:19:16] <arkv01> def mommy
[1:19:22] <LunarRemix> M-mommy!
[1:19:24] <mapimb> SLIGHTLY
[1:19:26] <%CyberDingus> wew

[1:19:35] <Berendenn> its super worth
[1:19:36] <shevan123> did you hear about how they wanted to originally kill all the characters besides the 3 you choose for the final boss?
[1:19:38] <mapimb> YES PLEASE
[1:19:41] <+TQuick101> pride and accomplishment?
[1:20:11] <terminusterminal> Death to footfags

[1:20:44] <@dcn2049> It's... weird

[1:22:00] <ahaegotrigger> yeah some of them of pretty bad
[1:22:08] <terminusterminal> Everything's a hole in the dark.
[1:22:16] <+BurkeBigsby> Boobs help
[1:22:24] <ahaegotrigger> some are really cute still though
[1:22:27] <$doomp12> humans aren't that sexually dymorphic
[1:22:29] <+fizzguy47> yeah, i make that mistake ALL the time
[1:22:30] <thecrazyanbu> She gave cloud's hand a job
[1:22:47] <SilverRoddo> Sometimes, people are people
[1:22:48] <@dcn2049> likewise

[1:23:04] <%CyberDingus> Mommy gonna make her a mini-M
[1:23:04] <+Punishedkaiger> Most beautiful girl I ever knew never wore makeup
[1:23:06] <$jamarartdoodles> We have to slut you up
[1:23:09] <arkv01> just blackens your entier screen for the rest of the game
[1:23:15] <+Jump_Guardian> do it
[1:23:32] <LunarRemix> Too much feels fake. Like not-human.
[1:23:32] <@dcn2049> There's layers to everything
[1:23:40] <%CyberDingus> "Hey bitch! Check out how FINE my face-painting skill are!"
[1:23:56] <%CyberDingus> "Bet you can't out-do me, Karen!"
[1:23:58] <ahaegotrigger> Damn LUL I know what youre talking about

[1:25:31] <+Fatemaster> The punishment should be the poor man's massage.
[1:25:32] <mapimb> is that goofy
[1:26:27] <mr_slaide> Dude... he has a hat. IT's gotta count for something.
[1:27:09] <snowmanse> I can't believe the slums has an "evergreen park"
[1:27:10] <%CyberDingus> "Hey have you heard about this Angel? Her vagina is extra tight!"
[1:27:12] <SirMcSlushy> Lady looks kinda like a dwarf
[1:27:13] <arkv01> she could be the garden angle
[1:27:14] <Commissar_Cornflakes> Jesus, what the fuck is with that sword
[1:27:24] <LunarRemix> It could be her daughter.
[1:27:25] <mr_slaide> Peter PArker knows Spider-Man.
[1:27:51] <mr_slaide> How else could he get all those pictures?
[1:27:57] <TheLucidChiba> So what are chats feelings on the time ghosts fate stuff?
[1:28:08] <mr_slaide> It's dumb.
[1:28:19] <arkv01> time ghosts can eat my poop
[1:28:22] <BillieNoMates> inb4 Time Jannies appear and cremate that woman
[1:28:26] <cap_bon> holy shit you have free reign !? nomura is truely generous
[1:28:31] <BillieNoMates> "No garden angels......"
[1:28:32] <+arancet> "too obvious to be the answer" is what i think 90% of the time i turn out to be right
[1:28:39] <SirMcSlushy> Dat meathead voice
[1:28:40] <BillieNoMates> Its the Pilaf Gang!
[1:29:03] <BillieNoMates> He had it last fight
[1:29:10] <BillieNoMates> A pro wrestler?
[1:29:10] <thecrazyanbu> It's Jack Black!
[1:29:12] <+jetjagger222> casey jones has fallen on hard times
[1:29:16] <+TQuick101> they stole hell house?

[1:29:33] <$jamarartdoodles> Casey Jones lol
[1:29:35] <arkv01> dude's wearing a diaper
[1:29:38] <TheLucidChiba> He wouldn't be able to dress himself
[1:29:38] <+TQuick101> Not personally, no
[1:29:44] <+fizzguy47> practise social distancing
[1:29:44] <IntrepidEye> yes sadly
[1:29:44] <gnollAUS> No
[1:29:45] <@dcn2049> Where I work... yes
[1:29:45] <thecrazyanbu> Just watch the news
[1:29:47] <+Punishedkaiger> Yeah
[1:29:47] <+FunkyRot> yea, me unga bunga
[1:29:47] <+thefakeh> paige?
[1:29:47] <ahaegotrigger> not THAT bad
[1:29:48] <+fizzguy47> yes
[1:29:49] <+jetjagger222> YUP
[1:29:51] <arkv01> only when they've had too many dranks
[1:29:52] <%CyberDingus> booze brings out that behavior, sometimes.
[1:29:52] <mr_slaide> Some feminists.
[1:29:53] <terminusterminal> Only at a mental hospital for ruined children
[1:29:54] <seth45er> yes but their in prison
[1:29:58] <gonzalogp98> i knew a guy
[1:30:04] <gnollAUS> Just remember, there are people with such low IQ the army won't take em
[1:30:05] <+Punishedkaiger> There was a special ed kid named Nathaniel
[1:30:11] <cherrycottontail> They call in to our customer support line all the time.
[1:30:12] <+jetjagger222> MORTIS
[1:30:22] <%CyberDingus> @PlagueOfGripes listen to their dialogue this time?
[1:30:26] <TheWe4pon> how lkong DOES that last?
[1:30:42] <snowmanse> Can you spam buttons to break out early?
[1:30:47] <mr_slaide> I knew a girl who looked at people and saw dragons inhabiting them. No, I am not joking.
[1:30:50] <BillieNoMates> Try equipping an item to stop it?
[1:30:59] <BillieNoMates> Im sure you have a non-stun trinket
[1:31:02] <+BurkeBigsby> Oh my god the load times atpSpiner
[1:31:22] <gonzalogp98> my cousin had a farm, they had one guy with his son working on their fields. the guy's son was like a wall of meat that used to ''play'' with the bulls
[1:31:37] <arkv01> please expand on "play"
[1:31:39] <%CyberDingus> awww
[1:31:42] <JohnSircesCastle> plagueGripes
[1:31:54] <gonzalogp98> he was really sweet but he scared me shitless, he gifted me a hot wheels
[1:32:03] <SirMcSlushy> Oof
[1:32:07] <+Queenemereldas> hold triangle
[1:32:08] <thecrazyanbu> Was he Lenny from Of Mice and Men?
[1:32:12] <+BurkeBigsby> Shuddup and enjoy the amazing dialogue of this masterpiece.
[1:32:15] <BillieNoMates> cant you mash through text?
[1:32:31] <arkv01> this scene is one of those weirdly long in-game engine scenes
[1:32:42] <gonzalogp98> no, this guy had a buzzcut
[1:33:07] <BillieNoMates> THE SLAM
[1:33:10] <BillieNoMates> BAH GAWD
[1:33:36] <thecrazyanbu> Watch Cloud beat up a mentally disabled man with a sword!
[1:33:47] <@Nightbot> Plague is a youtube animator and also streams at https://picarto.tv/Plague . Also: t-shirts! http://goo.gl/lze8QO
[1:33:52] <oshkeet41> in fairness Cloud is ALSO a bit mentally disabled
[1:33:59] <%CyberDingus> all that sword swinging, NOT A DROP OF BLOOD
[1:34:00] <BillieNoMates> Two bravers is more
[1:34:02] <%CyberDingus> How?
[1:34:05] <thecrazyanbu> Quite true
[1:34:25] <Commissar_Cornflakes> is this supposed to be funny
[1:34:37] <@dcn2049> god damned puns
[1:34:40] <BillieNoMates> You mean like all languages, Plague?
[1:35:02] <+Punishedkaiger> They are not arrested
[1:35:03] <CursedNobleman> humor is culturally specific, it doesnt always translate well.
[1:35:03] <@dcn2049> japan dialogue more than much other.
[1:35:04] <mapimb> animie comedy is almost never funny
[1:35:07] <CursedNobleman> except mr bean.
[1:35:18] <CursedNobleman> mr bean is global.
[1:35:24] <arkv01> yeah I love that mr bean anime
[1:35:32] <cap_bon> mr bean transcends language
[1:35:40] <examplez0> Mr. Bean transcends anime
[1:35:45] <LunarRemix> It helps that he doesn't talk much
[1:35:52] <CursedNobleman> Miyazaki: Mr. Bean was a mistake.
[1:36:05] <+ATorL> words are formed from glyphs which have their own representations
[1:36:13] <nuke_india> what do you Farm?
[1:36:20] <arkv01> and the glylpgs themselves are used to cast magic
[1:36:29] <+jetjagger222> toriyama
[1:36:42] <examplez0> Kojima's humor consists of fart jokes and soda drinking monkeys
[1:36:45] <CursedNobleman> i mean hell. i saw mr bean playing in a restaurant in central vietnam. that was lit.
[1:37:02] <arkv01> the monkey was his crowning achievement in character design
[1:37:03] <+lordericter> gotta get swole before you get pretty
[1:37:07] <+fizzguy47> later
[1:37:07] <+ATorL> not exactly indecipherable, just so complicated to localize that it would kill the joke
[1:37:12] <@dcn2049> what the hell
[1:37:21] <%CyberDingus> Ah it's a man.
[1:37:25] <+BurkeBigsby> I am scared of this man.
[1:37:26] <%CyberDingus> I was confused for a second
[1:37:39] <+fizzguy47> this will be fun
[1:37:42] <SirMcSlushy> This man's lips
[1:37:43] <@dcn2049> nooope
[1:37:45] <+ATorL> yarinaika
[1:37:47] <BillieNoMates> Is this what changed the bathhouse?
[1:37:52] <cherrycottontail> oh people keep saying htis was cut
[1:37:54] <%Rezca> In what way are we taking them on?
[1:38:04] <LunarRemix> Oh wow I remember that blonde guy
[1:38:05] <BillieNoMates> So now we are in Gachi
[1:38:07] <tonfirean> did I miss Cloud getting pretty or is that still upcoming?
[1:38:08] <BillieNoMates> Good to know
[1:38:12] <Jeemukun> that is a very pretty man
[1:38:16] <+BurkeBigsby> Wasn't this Gym buff dudes doing squats in the OG?
[1:38:17] <arkv01> should've named this guy billy
[1:38:18] <thecrazyanbu> Ru Paul's FF7
[1:38:18] <%CyberDingus> Gachi
[1:38:19] <+fizzguy47> @tonfirean l8r
[1:38:41] <ahaegotrigger> squat off?
[1:38:53] <%CyberDingus> This man's eyebrows are neat :v
[1:39:02] <arkv01> I rememebr one of these guys getting launched by ronnie in the original
[1:39:03] <ahaegotrigger> this is VERY strange
[1:39:03] <%Rezca> SQUAT OFF
[1:39:05] <Berendenn> I love how they eat shit after like 2 squats
[1:39:05] <arkv01> good times
[1:39:07] <tonfirean> thx
[1:39:10] <Gavaline> I too used squat-offs to establish dominance at my gym pre-Wuflu
[1:39:17] <+fizzguy47> it's awkward on console!
[1:39:26] <ahaegotrigger> this is usually just weighted in the gym though
[1:39:30] <arkv01> wouldn't squat offs taking forever
[1:39:32] <thecrazyanbu> We go with the ancient method. The squat off
[1:39:33] <tonfirean> I need to exercise so I'm going to squat along
[1:39:39] <arkv01> like you could get into the several hundreds
[1:39:40] <+fizzguy47> rhythm games
[1:39:46] <notanegg8> so it expects you to stay on rhythm but also speeds up automatically???
[1:40:05] <BillieNoMates> Getting fatigued at body weight exercises as a super soldier seems redundant
[1:40:11] <+HawkGoggles2> This man fucked up on 1.
[1:40:15] <BillieNoMates> This fucking music
[1:40:16] <TheLucidChiba> This is just FFIX jump rope with a different skin
[1:40:19] <Berendenn> 1 squat
[1:40:20] <Berendenn> falls over
[1:40:21] <Jeemukun> oh that's just mean
[1:40:23] <%JailShmixRemix> This song
[1:40:24] <LunarRemix> Yeah thsi is Gym music alright.
[1:40:25] <DrMcCannonfodder> mah boy zack was great at squats... BibleThump
[1:40:26] <Johnmaddened> sick remix
[1:40:33] <CursedNobleman> trance LUL
[1:40:34] <Gavaline> Is this the P5 Dancing game I've heard so much about?
[1:40:34] <Commissar_Cornflakes> what is this even
[1:40:35] <thecrazyanbu> How the hell does someone screw up a squat so bad that they fall over?
[1:40:36] <%CyberDingus> Cloud moves like a machine. Groovy
[1:40:37] <%caramello_man> the animation looks so dumb
[1:40:46] <+HawkGoggles2> This animation looks awful and jank.
[1:40:46] <+MrWrann> The fact that he just hard pauses is so goofy
[1:40:54] <thecrazyanbu> That's less realistic than carrying something like the buster sword
[1:40:54] <LunarRemix> You can bet someone will just take this music and actually use for their workout session
[1:40:57] <ahaegotrigger> yeah this looks like shit but it is funny
[1:40:59] <%JailShmixRemix> Almost 30 :(
[1:40:59] <arkv01> ff7 got that edm of the year going on
[1:40:59] <+Punishedkaiger> I feel like I'm insane for thinking that they take away the hud from you
[1:41:02] <%CyberDingus> Cloud is a fan of Daft Punk !
[1:41:02] <oshkeet41> deliberately janky animation
[1:41:02] <+BurkeBigsby> Just like real squats.
[1:41:02] <examplez0> So this is the power of the PS4...
[1:41:03] <@dcn2049> no kidding
[1:41:08] <arkv01> now smash ronnie in
[1:41:11] <+fizzguy47> dropped frames huh?
[1:41:13] <%Gogogolem> 14 squats?
[1:41:13] <Josshoo> Not bad at all-looking good
[1:41:15] <+HawkGoggles2> Yeah it did.
[1:41:18] <SupportWriter> Why does cloud look like he's going at 20 fs
[1:41:21] <SupportWriter> fps
[1:41:24] <Gavaline> So the robotic squats are Cloud imagining how a soldier would squat
[1:41:28] <BillieNoMates> Haha
[1:41:29] <arkv01> PROTEIN
[1:41:31] <Commissar_Cornflakes> Cloud isn't THAT scrawny
[1:41:32] <%Rezca> ok... I am out of shape
[1:41:33] <BillieNoMates> I like this
[1:41:38] <DagetStreams> He's still blinking too, Cloud just posing for a solid minute straight
[1:41:48] <BillieNoMates> "let's go shower off"
[1:41:49] <framewindowcleaner> Jules is a JOJO character LUL
[1:41:49] <Josshoo> Jules has hair like a greek goddess
[1:41:57] <+FunkyRot> my boiiiiis
[1:41:58] <arkv01> hell yeah jules, show me the back room
[1:41:58] <BillieNoMates> 30 for the belt I think
[1:41:58] <+jetjagger222> is that a luchador moogle motif on his outfit
[1:42:02] <%Gogogolem> Isn't Cloud a big cheater cause he took Steroids?
[1:42:02] <BillieNoMates> So you were slightly off
[1:42:06] <BillieNoMates> Yes
[1:42:08] <cherrycottontail> what's this voice actor again
[1:42:09] <%CyberDingus> @Josshoo he does a lot of things like a greek goddess
[1:42:10] <BillieNoMates> Cloud is magic powered
[1:42:19] <ahaegotrigger> time to become HUGE
[1:42:21] <SirMcSlushy> Squats tho
[1:42:27] <SirMcSlushy> Said no one
[1:42:29] <%Gogogolem> magic steroids.
[1:42:29] <thecrazyanbu> It's not the size of your build. It's the size of your heart
[1:42:33] <thecrazyanbu> Also do some good cardio
[1:42:37] <Gavaline> I hope these guys aren't hurt by time ghosts later on in the sequels :(
[1:42:43] <BillieNoMates> He's a nomura special. He's not going anywhere
[1:42:48] <BillieNoMates> This isn't Yoko Taro
[1:42:52] <Monkeyweed21> how many whores has chadley propositioned?
[1:42:56] <Berendenn> CHADLEY IS A GOOD BOY
[1:43:13] <+TQuick101> but nah tho
[1:43:14] <+StreamStopA> @Berendenn no
[1:43:23] <arkv01> no, chadley deserves cock and ball torture
[1:43:23] <Jeemukun> >shear's counterattack HA
[1:43:29] <+jetjagger222> that's so stupid its funny
[1:43:30] <+HawkGoggles2> We gotta put some more combat in here somewhere. Kappa
[1:43:33] <SilverRoddo> What fandom was he from?
[1:43:37] <framewindowcleaner> This entire game is padding
[1:43:37] <BillieNoMates> Chadley has developed a new form of dick press
[1:43:39] <examplez0> At least you don't have to fight the Hell House ever again
[1:43:47] <mapimb> CONTENT
[1:43:55] <mapimb> YAY
[1:44:08] <TheWe4pon> man i like these SIDE quests
[1:44:10] <tonfirean> Where's Aerith anyway?
[1:44:29] <BillieNoMates> Being slutted up
[1:44:38] <%CyberDingus> Mommy M does her magic
[1:44:43] <mapimb> I feel like plague would like trails in the sky
[1:44:57] <@dcn2049> details matter
[1:44:58] <OToole42> You're a cute little detail @PlagueOfGripes
[1:45:14] <tonfirean> You're breathtaking!
[1:45:17] <+StreamStopA> fight the special kids
[1:45:24] <nigawatts1988> It's the water.
[1:45:28] <framewindowcleaner> Reminder that within 10 hours of the OG FFVII you were already past the Midgar Zolom
[1:45:35] <oshkeet41> probably all the gay sex
[1:45:37] <CursedNobleman> Pizzabutterbot! PogChamp
[1:45:38] <mapimb> ooooh
[1:45:40] <@dcn2049> I like the engine atop it
[1:45:43] <Gavaline> Hot rod version of mechs are great
[1:45:45] <Berendenn> the rewards for the coloseum fights are super worth
[1:45:47] <Monkeyweed21> i think there's an option to just wait for Aerith instead of going to the colosseum
[1:45:48] <+BurkeBigsby> Peak Degeneracy.
[1:45:49] <BillieNoMates> You already fought him
[1:45:50] <+Queenemereldas> you can get your second limit break here
[1:45:59] <Fredcome2bed> degenerate central
[1:46:00] <cap_bon> some guy in the slums put alot of work into painting that thing
[1:46:01] <oshkeet41> kinda looks like a 3D sonic game boss
[1:46:42] <Josshoo> I really like this combat system. I wish it was attached to a story I was more interested in
[1:46:44] <SirMcSlushy> Can ya block him?
[1:46:51] <BillieNoMates> Baitd by AI
[1:46:51] <%CyberDingus> @PlagueOfGripes assess?
[1:47:09] <nigawatts1988> Punisher Counter always saves the day.
[1:47:23] <SirMcSlushy> Oof, that came outta nowhere
[1:47:33] <tonfirean> keep up the pressure!
[1:47:43] <OToole42> just wants a piece of cloud, can you blame it?
[1:47:53] <framewindowcleaner> Fair and well designed I - frames
[1:48:15] <Berendenn> block is way better than dodge in this, usually opens up pressure states
[1:48:19] <SirMcSlushy> Can ya dark choose cheese dodge into the attack to get behind him :p? I've not got a great grasp on the controls.
[1:48:23] <SirMcSlushy> dark souls*
[1:48:34] <BillieNoMates> Not really
[1:48:38] <mapimb> nope
[1:48:41] <BillieNoMates> Its not that precise, ironically
[1:48:46] <tonfirean> Do the player party characters have a stagger bar?
[1:48:52] <BillieNoMates> Nah
[1:48:58] <BillieNoMates> Just a flat stun/not stun state
[1:49:16] <+Nekun> punisher mode is king against cutters
[1:49:30] <framewindowcleaner> This game is literally "parry to win"
[1:49:32] <SirMcSlushy> Man this really does seem like a counter war boss
[1:49:41] <@dcn2049> yeah looks like it's a defensive battle
[1:49:44] <BillieNoMates> thats what they want you to do on 90% of fights ironically
[1:49:45] <@dcn2049> sweet
[1:49:51] <BillieNoMates> Its just you can brute force alot
[1:49:53] <+Punishedkaiger> That was a huge number
[1:49:57] <mapimb> stop dodging
[1:50:00] <SirMcSlushy> Just nut up
[1:50:01] <SirMcSlushy> Aparently
[1:50:03] <Berendenn> block >dodge
[1:50:10] <mapimb> just block
[1:50:12] <tonfirean> twinkle toes!
[1:50:13] <BillieNoMates> Dodge is for AoE spells
[1:50:22] <+azure22900> Is this dark souls 1?
[1:50:32] <+Queenemereldas> could have just thrown lightning
[1:50:35] <BillieNoMates> "Bitch, I just made you 1 million gil. Where's my cut?"
[1:50:37] <+MrWrann> Isn't that what you did in the original FF7, just stand there and take it
[1:50:38] <@dcn2049> She gets off on this stuff
[1:50:42] <%CyberDingus> "I wanted to get moist, sweet boy~"
[1:50:50] <Josshoo> Yo, put HER in the party
[1:50:58] <JohnClaggart> and a dog
[1:51:03] <Commissar_Cornflakes> Don't worry lady
[1:51:06] <%JailShmixRemix> BARETTE hggGasm
[1:51:06] <framewindowcleaner> LULU ?
[1:51:15] <tonfirean> She has a shoulder!
[1:51:16] <Commissar_Cornflakes> Cloud refuses to dick down any of the many women who blatantly want it
[1:51:16] <TheWe4pon> my dick like her
[1:51:16] <Gavaline> And eventually a cat!
[1:51:17] <%CyberDingus> @PlagueOfGripes she is funny
[1:51:18] <%JailShmixRemix> It's the shoulder!
[1:51:19] <CursedNobleman> boooooobs
[1:51:21] <+jetjagger222> fun fact: her bow is tied from the front, that means she's a courtesan
[1:51:21] <BillieNoMates> she's the ara ara mommy dom type
[1:51:22] <@dcn2049> Meh
[1:51:22] <Josshoo> Its probably the confidence
[1:51:26] <BillieNoMates> She's boring
[1:51:31] <+axenred> plague is too nice to tewll you your aifu is shit
[1:51:37] <arkv01> needs more belts true
[1:51:37] <OToole42> hobo cloud needs his bench nap

[1:51:42] <framewindowcleaner> Yeah, Lulu is still way better
[1:51:48] <red_blaster> She can make you cum by touching your hands
[1:51:54] <+justianxix> Eh, I find Lulu kinda boring
[1:51:56] <BillieNoMates> Give me the Garden Angel any day
[1:51:59] <BillieNoMates> Kappa

[1:52:14] <SirMcSlushy> Pffft
[1:52:14] <Berendenn> loadavator
[1:52:17] <arkv01> the appeal of lulu is sometimes you may wake up and she's going down on you
[1:52:17] <SilverRoddo> “She’s stern, stern but fair.” LuvPeekR
[1:52:27] <SirMcSlushy> Does a big load, and then freezes to load more as the door is half open
[1:52:38] <+jetjagger222> lulu ended up with wakka. nuff said.

[1:53:03] <Gavaline> If this leads into setting up Dissidia level metaverse shit, how bad will the all-the-Cids scene be?
[1:53:05] <BillieNoMates> "tifa isn't a virgin!"
[1:53:06] <framewindowcleaner> What's the point of this goober?

[1:58:49] <Josshoo> "You should be standing on top of a wedding cake"
[1:58:49] <SirMcSlushy> "She should be standing on top of a wedding cake!" xD
[1:58:51] <arkv01> guess aeris still ain't uckable

[1:59:51] <BillieNoMates> Well the clothing guy had no reason to do what he did
[1:59:55] <sporeian94> Unfortunately they also got rid of The #%$@%^ Room
[1:59:58] <LunarRemix> Just be honest
[2:00:03] <arkv01> the fetch quests in the original wouldn't translate too well to the remake I guess
[2:00:07] <+kujofire990> Flamenco?

[2:00:14] <%Gogogolem> Salsa
[2:00:15] <+TQuick101> How would you design the dress?
[2:00:18] <SirMcSlushy> Frills remind me of like, spanish dresses.

[2:01:19] <oshkeet41> make sure to equip your materia to it
[2:01:26] <thecrazyanbu> Let's not mock Aerith and Andrea's shared fetishes
[2:01:26] <+Punishedkaiger> Would there be a feminine grundle?
[2:01:31] <%Gogogolem> Can cloud just leave the dress on for the rest of the game?
[2:01:36] <tonfirean> We'll be checking the mouthfeel on the way in

[2:07:22] <%CyberDingus> this place has drugs in the air or something
[2:07:23] <examplez0> Why are we here?
[2:07:24] <Gavaline> It was a joke to explain the moaning

[2:09:56] <+RooddlesMcgriF> plague remember to perfect this mini game to get the song
[2:09:58] <+Punishedkaiger> They'll probably expect you to play the PC port with a controller
[2:10:00] <@dcn2049> X is purple
[2:10:01] <JohnClaggart> it would just be action colors
[2:10:02] <Thewoodentree> Aren't you terrorists or something?
[2:10:03] <Berendenn> square is pink
[2:10:04] <thecrazyanbu> This dance needs to either be from Little Miss Sunshin or Shrek
[2:10:05] <GeltonZ> Square is pink
[2:10:06] <sporeian94> Circle is red, Square is purple, x is blue, triangle is green
[2:10:06] <Berendenn> circle red

[2:10:30] <%CyberDingus> THIS was made for the fan girls
[2:10:31] <sporeian94> Wait till the honeycomb overlaps with the icon
[2:10:31] <+Nekun> repeat this until perfect, if you care about collectables
[2:10:32] <BTRNDL> why....

[2:10:44] <+HawkGoggles2> When the ring closes in.
[2:10:46] <Thewoodentree> He accidently kills all of them
[2:10:47] <tonfirean> It's probably easier to tell by the ring around the icon
[2:10:48] <PerfectAsymmetry> Yeah! Dance for me Bishy Cloud
[2:10:48] <vonmaultke> the circle around the button
[2:10:49] <Berendenn> hexagon closes in on timing
[2:10:49] <Jeemukun> this isn't dancing cloud
[2:10:49] <%CyberDingus> Some young girls would enjoy THIS section.
[2:10:54] <gnollAUS> When the thing comes in to touched the prompt
[2:10:54] <+RandomDefault> We Yakuza now boys
[2:10:55] <KaiserMario> The outer ring closing in is the timing
[2:10:55] <ahaegotrigger> this depth perception check is quite something
[2:10:58] <MilkingEdge> work it cloud
[2:10:59] <stfn893> Do they get to sting you if you win
[2:11:05] <GeltonZ> This looks like my favorite part of the game.

[2:11:06] <SuperVaderMan> When the outer ring lines up with the shape

[2:14:31] <thecrazyanbu> I can appreciate a game having a dance off
[2:14:35] <%kyh9> Scenes women will never understand
[2:14:36] <+RooddlesMcgriF> you're looking at perfection
[2:14:36] <examplez0> This is somehow even more degrading than being in a hot tub with 15 burly men
[2:14:37] <arkv01> WORK WHAT GOD GAVE YA
[2:14:38] <Commissar_Cornflakes> How does Cloud even know how to do this
[2:14:39] <+zombieghost1337> what in the sam fuck
[2:14:41] <+HawkGoggles2> I bet these button's don't even do anything other than points.
[2:14:41] <Gavaline> This is dumb, and probably was a massive waste of development time and resources, but I kind of like it.
[2:14:44] <BTRNDL> I'm so glad I waited a 100 years for this remake elaK
[2:14:48] <Josshoo> This is honestly the most likable Cloud has ever been
[2:14:48] <+fizzguy47> Bless you, Nomura
[2:14:48] <Monkeyweed21> The QTE's are being run the time ghosts
[2:14:51] <NWannabe> lol, this is SO cloud
[2:14:51] <red_blaster> It doesn't matter, it's amazing
[2:14:52] <sosandstorm> It IS something he would be made to do though
[2:14:53] <+SirGO0SE> well i'd hate to tell you, but now he does
[2:14:54] <examplez0> I bet this was Toriyama's idea
[2:14:55] <cherrycottontail> nah this is something cloud would totally do
[2:14:55] <LunarRemix> Well he's doing it
[2:14:56] <CursedNobleman> Guys only want one thing and its disgusting PogChamp
[2:14:57] <BillieNoMates> Nomura Cloud WILL do this
[2:14:59] <EliahNebb> This is what I hate about video games, it appeals to the male fantasy
[2:15:01] <+justianxix> I love how dumb this is though
[2:15:02] <%CyberDingus> @PlagueOfGripes he is doing it for Tifa. He is a good boy
[2:15:04] <BillieNoMates> The time jannies tried to stop this
[2:15:05] <GeltonZ> The Time Ghosts are okay with this.
[2:15:05] <+Jump_Guardian> zach has taken over
[2:15:07] <mapimb> wtf
[2:15:10] <%kyh9> Final Fantasy 7: Dancing all Night
[2:15:10] <NWannabe> All cloud's except advent children era
[2:15:10] <arkv01> this is FOR ALL THE HONIES
[2:15:11] <%Gogogolem> wow this is badly designed?
[2:15:12] <+illoonar> "This is why I hate videogames..." Kappa
[2:15:13] <+tymetak> Was clouds air thrusting the reason this game took so long to come out?
[2:15:15] <+Solid_Stro> This is 2020 Cloud Plague
[2:15:16] <%Rezca> ah, remeinds me of Drakengard endgame
[2:15:18] <@dcn2049> it's expecting you to play on color
[2:15:19] <examplez0> Where are the time ghosts when you need them?
[2:15:24] <luckycloud91> Nah man, hes a soldier 1st class
[2:15:25] <Gavaline> Spoken like someone who never got the Drakengard 3 true end
[2:15:25] <KaiserMario> Git gud SBRUB
[2:15:27] <sosuke5> When does Sephiroth show up and start break dancing?
[2:15:31] <+BurkeBigsby> When is the RPG?
[2:15:36] <+Solid_Stro> @examplez0 “We will allow this”
[2:15:37] <@dcn2049> Whatever you're doing doesn't seem to change the scene though
[2:15:38] <sosandstorm> It isn't FOR you
[2:15:39] <oshkeet41> unrealistic expectations: being entertaining and praise from others
[2:15:41] <luckycloud91> He was prepared for this
[2:15:42] <NWannabe> Lies, Plague. You know it's awakening things within you
[2:15:42] <Monkeyweed21> ART is happening
[2:15:44] <Thewoodentree> This is why I hate video games, they all appeal to the male fantasy.
[2:15:44] <thecrazyanbu> Every battle ingame will now be decided through dance
[2:15:47] <Berendenn> it changes aerith's reactions
[2:15:48] <TheWe4pon> wow i wish they would of just cut out honey bee in then do this shit.
[2:15:50] <%caramello_man> the time ghosts are controlling clouds body!
[2:15:53] <oshkeet41> you probably get an extra cookie or something for doing it pefect
[2:15:55] <framewindowcleaner> I'm glad I got this instead of more actual content
[2:15:59] <cap_bon> FF7 danceing all night
[2:16:00] <medril07> 2snacks sephiroth dancing
[2:16:02] <sosandstorm> I am surprised how long it is though
[2:16:10] <+justianxix> doing pretty good
[2:16:10] <Gavaline> Time ghosts catcalling from the audience
[2:16:15] <BillieNoMates> WOW

[2:16:33] <GeltonZ> As a Time Ghosts I can confirm that I love this.
[2:16:37] <BillieNoMates> This is X-2 tier
[2:16:38] <@dcn2049> oh no
[2:16:41] <%CyberDingus> @PlagueOfGripes the gayman LOVED it
[2:16:45] <+fizzguy47> oh yes
[2:16:45] <framewindowcleaner> What is it with Nomura and putting Atlatntica in every game?
[2:16:49] <%CyberDingus> Gayman > Aerith
[2:16:50] <Josshoo> Good enough for him, not for Aerith though ahaha
[2:16:51] <sosandstorm> I bet she says that unless you do it literally perfect
[2:16:53] <+TQuick101> Seems like you can't fail, at least
[2:16:56] <hassanico2> Wait we're doing this now in public?

[2:17:00] <+Punishedkaiger> @PlagueOfGripes And now Cloud gets fed a bunch of pills

[2:17:50] <gnollAUS> Hair a little wrong
[2:17:50] <+kujofire990> HE hates it
[2:17:50] <BillieNoMates> I think thats the point
[2:17:52] <@dcn2049> yeah the dress is a bit much
[2:17:53] <Josshoo> He's reserved, Plague, you heathen!
[2:17:53] <KaiserMario> Ghastly

[2:17:56] <%bettysharkface> Kinda disappointing
[2:17:56] <+PartyTimeAustin> wait what determines what dress you are in
[2:18:00] <london_flexing> I mean, soy does nothing. The estrogen is literally all you need
[2:18:00] <+Jumpie8> Cloud is like wtf did I sign up for
[2:18:01] <+PartyTimeAustin> i got a diff one
[2:18:02] <+fizzguy47> @unwoundcaesar70 AIEEEEE!
[2:18:03] <%bettysharkface> The hair looks bad
[2:18:04] <examplez0> He's missing the two braids
[2:18:06] <KaironFortressKnight> I has a way better dress in my game.
[2:18:06] <TechDragon_Z> That's a different dress from another streamer I watched. I guess it's depending on the dance performance.
[2:18:08] <BillieNoMates> Aerith is wet as fuck right now
[2:18:08] <red_blaster> Did Aerith trick you into making her fetish into a reality?
[2:18:11] <Berendenn> your dance score chooses your outift
[2:18:14] <KaironFortressKnight> had
[2:18:15] <Gavaline> That's still what's happening now
[2:18:16] <hassanico2> @PartyTimeAustin the sidequests you end up doing
[2:18:19] <%CyberDingus> Aerith is very very into it
[2:18:23] <+BurkeBigsby> This must have amped this up for the "western" audience.
[2:18:25] <%CyberDingus> Aerith is a bad girl
[2:18:25] <dmdyne99> Andrea's so woke
[2:18:27] <sosandstorm> what you don't see is Aerith just SOAKING the floor beneath the table

[2:18:31] <@dcn2049> HAHA
[2:18:33] <+HawkGoggles2> One of the only things saving this is Cloud's dead eyes.
[2:18:33] <SupportWriter> I can't believe Cloud came out of the closet
[2:18:34] <sporeian94> I'd need a chest wax
[2:18:35] <Josshoo> The beard doesnt help\
[2:18:35] <+dawsfloss> naw Plague you can do it
[2:18:36] <red_blaster> Cloud can get better dresses
[2:18:38] <arkv01> hell yeah lets doll plague up
[2:18:38] <+SirGO0SE> i think youd look great with hair extensions plauge
[2:18:41] <examplez0> Time for your dick flattening, Cloud

[2:19:06] <+SirGO0SE> LUL
[2:19:09] <mapimb> he's so upset

[2:19:46] <+SirGO0SE> Gotta jerk it huh Plague?
[2:19:47] <oshkeet41> I think you can get a different dress, the one in the trailer is plainer and blue?
[2:19:47] <+BurkeBigsby> so you don't have to do the same shit to get the dress like in OG?
[2:19:49] <+tymetak> I uuhhh...GOTAGO

[2:21:13] <sosandstorm> Swoolie
[2:21:14] <arkv01> all they needed was to put in lightning's model instead of cloud for this segment
[2:21:15] <tonfirean> Honestly, he's prettier in his regular outfit.
[2:21:16] <%CyberDingus> Aerith has no shame and she must be stopped.
[2:21:29] <arkv01> but toriyama be a bitch like that
[2:21:34] <sosuke5> I don't think there's ever been a ff game that goes so hard on "everyone wants to FUCK the main character"
[2:21:34] <GeltonZ> I hope there's a way to replay the dancing mini game. There has to be.
[2:21:38] <gonzalogp98> aerith be like ''now cloud to continue the plan, you need to be mating pressed''
[2:21:39] <Monkeyweed21> you get the original black dress and braids if you skip all the side quests
[2:21:39] <framewindowcleaner> FFXIII's director has new masturbation fodder
[2:21:43] <+justianxix> Aerith is a not so secret Fujoshi
[2:21:56] <examplez0> And it consists entirely of Lightning
[2:21:58] <%CyberDingus> DAMN FUJOSHI

[2:23:32] <oshkeet41> Zack looked hotter in dresses i guess
[2:23:32] <thecrazyanbu> Aeris wanted to see some leg
[2:23:32] <tonfirean> There's no way a woman can be that hot. She's gotta be a man.
[2:23:34] <ahaegotrigger> yeah thats totally not a proposition
[2:23:41] <sosandstorm> Feels like the cat calls might be a lesson in empathy
[2:23:43] <+tymetak> This reminds me of the scene in Shallow Hal
[2:23:44] <terminusterminal> They're talking about Aeris right?
[2:23:46] <GeltonZ> To be fair, Aerith's hair is FUCKING AMAZING right now!
[2:23:54] <%CyberDingus> Maybe

[2:37:59] <Djinnazz> Leslie's totally Chill.
[2:37:59] <Sokumotanaka> Thanks noctis
[2:38:00] <%CyberDingus> "Get the fuck off of my workplace, bitches''
[2:38:04] <Jflaskd13> you'll see lol
[2:38:08] <Jflaskd13> doodThirst
[2:38:09] <Thewoodentree> These are the most upbeat assassins ive ever seen
[2:38:10] <BillieNoMates> time to fight naked
[2:38:11] <sosandstorm> Eh, that's alright
[2:38:11] <Jflaskd13> nah
[2:38:15] <+ATorL> Cloud is obviously wearing his stuff under the dress
[2:38:15] <+RayDaug> He does a Yakuza shirt rip
[2:38:16] <Explodincatz> same thing with the 3D models
[2:38:21] <+HawkGoggles2> Could is gonna pull a Yakuza and rip it all off? Kappa
[2:38:23] <Josshoo> His real clothes are underneath
[2:38:23] <cherrycottontail> They could totally just have him spin around again
[2:38:24] <KaiserMario> Remember to check Tifa's gear
[2:38:25] <Monkeyweed21> Magical girl transformation
[2:38:26] <AxelCezar> maybe his uniform is already there, the dress is pretty big
[2:38:28] <arkv01> he do spin
[2:38:28] <+BurkeBigsby> It'll be a rythm game with dancing.
[2:38:30] <+justianxix> Its the rape room soooo...
[2:38:38] <+kujofire990> the drugs
[2:38:41] <GeltonZ> Pocket sand...OR maybe we'll luck out and get a magical girl transformation for Cloud?
[2:38:45] <seth45er> bundle of cable
[2:38:45] <sosandstorm> "this rape room has no elegance"
[2:38:46] <+tymetak> no time to clean up with all the gang bangin going on
[2:38:48] <GeltonZ> USE THE DRESS SPHERE CLOUD!
[2:38:55] <JohnClaggart> i like how tifa's dress was better for fighting than her original outfit
[2:38:58] <Sokumotanaka> @PlagueOfGripes Remember to check tifa's gear
[2:38:59] <Monkeyweed21> redress is a canon spell
[2:39:05] <%Rezca> needs more mahjong minigames
[2:39:23] <+StreamStopA> where does she put it all
[2:39:51] <Berendenn> metal knuckles too good
[2:40:58] <mxt8420> dat music
[2:41:10] <+azure22900> Holding square when it appears in cutscenes will open the menu before a fight
[2:41:24] <+tymetak> Music feels inspired by Tekken picks
[2:41:41] <Djinnazz> you will
[2:41:54] <Berendenn> metal knuckles will last you the whole game
[2:43:10] <mapimb> !uptime
[2:43:11] <@Nightbot> 2 hours 43 minutes 20 seconds
[2:43:27] <Jflaskd13> you can sort
[2:43:30] <KaiserMario> R3
[2:43:32] <Djinnazz> left and right on the d-pad
[2:43:43] <Gavaline> Click R3/ right control stick?
[2:43:51] <terminusterminal> God this menu blows
[2:44:07] <Djinnazz> i like it.
[2:44:10] <slimbreadsticks> but bugenhagen
[2:44:18] <+PartyTimeAustin> agreed
[2:44:20] <Jflaskd13> I like it
[2:44:20] <AxelCezar> its atrocious
[2:44:24] <Explodincatz> constant shift in controls
[2:44:35] <mapimb> why is it spinning
[2:44:39] <IntrepidEye> its nice to look at but fuck trying to do one thing quickly
[2:44:40] <slimbreadsticks> `+10% bugenhagen
[2:45:24] <KaiserMario> @PlagueOfGripes In case you ever get confused if you can sort things in menus, if you look at the bottom right of the screen, they tell you the inputs
[2:46:17] <medril07> he's getting pile drived as we speak
[2:46:45] <Gavaline> Yeah, Tifa looks like she'd be pretty fun to handle :^)
[2:46:45] <mapimb> he is fucking dead
[2:46:46] <xrolenks> gotta go up to cloud
[2:46:46] <bevyrage> crawlspace
[2:46:50] <sosandstorm> another rape corner im sure
[2:46:51] <$doomp12> its fun to think that one of the lackeys is enjoying getting pounded by tifa
[2:46:55] <+HawkGoggles2> Secrets.
[2:47:24] <$doomp12> "dick flattening" as the kids call it
[2:47:43] <KaiserMario> Good for grinding
[2:47:51] <+justianxix> could be good on tifa
[2:48:25] <Berendenn> berserk isnt control loss in this its just more damage going in and out
[2:48:26] <CitrousCt> The music sounds a bit too techno for FF
[2:48:27] <+kujofire990> she's a summoner!
[2:48:35] <+Fatemaster> Sounds like a Gunbound track.
[2:48:36] <Josshoo> How dare you, this is girl power music!
[2:48:45] <Huntercd> If it's a character you are not good it could be useful
[2:48:46] <london_flexing> Yea, not my tea either
[2:48:59] <xrolenks> yeah its just best to use Tifa here
[2:49:11] <xrolenks> aeris is meant to range people
[2:49:23] <+TeethMuncher> Yeah! He loves it!
[2:49:24] <IntrepidEye> Her problem is that everything makes a beeline for her constantly
[2:49:32] <KaiserMario> Yeah, some of the remixes that do a lot of electronic sounds over orchestral aren't my favs... Some of the tracks sound like Tekken music rather than FF
[2:49:40] <tonfirean> Nice bounce physics
[2:49:55] <MilkingEdge> thats a man baby
[2:49:55] <+TQuick101> He changes in front of him?
[2:49:58] <+wizard_of_diamonds> What da fuck
[2:50:00] <SirMcSlushy> xD
[2:50:03] <tonfirean> Yeah, he's into it!
[2:50:03] <%Rezca> the moment from YES YES, to OH NO
[2:50:09] <%JailShmixRemix> I like how unsurprised he is
[2:50:09] <Thewoodentree> Haha your gay now
[2:50:16] <CitrousCt> Probably best to take it safe, especially with how things are these days
[2:50:16] <Huntercd> Oh boo it's just a black void where panties should be
[2:50:42] <vincerocmm> CBT
[2:50:44] <Commissar_Cornflakes> "Spill the beans or I'll cut them off" IS a good line.
[2:50:48] <%Rezca> aww, it got short
[2:50:49] <Johnmaddened> vargCBT
[2:50:57] <%Rezca> oh, there it is
[2:51:00] <hassanico2> Jiggle physics on that stomach too stronk
[2:51:02] <MilkingEdge> RIP AND TEAR
[2:51:09] <terminusterminal> Time for your testicle ripping. Yes Honey.
[2:51:25] <notanegg8> you're telling me heidegger has it out for avalanche?!
[2:51:25] <vincerocmm> oh no he LOVES IT
[2:51:26] <+TeethMuncher> CBT is timeless
[2:51:28] <tonfirean> What's the bit they didn't keep?
[2:51:30] <ahaegotrigger> HES INTO SMASHING
[2:51:32] <+justianxix> why wouldn't they tell you?
[2:51:38] <+machinetoys> why is it weird
[2:51:39] <+wizard_of_diamonds> CBT, otherwise known as Cock and Ball Torture
[2:51:47] <CitrousCt> I wonder if they'll do a compilation for FF7R
[2:51:49] <ahaegotrigger> True
[2:51:50] <AxelCezar> how the fuck is this surprising?
[2:51:51] <BurdRightsActivist> Because they're EVIL. plague
[2:51:53] <+claudesavegely> because Shinra is fucking evil
[2:51:53] <+HawkGoggles2> Oh no, they're going to send out Stamp, we can't fight him.
[2:51:53] <terminusterminal> But Avalanche didn't blow up two reactors. Shinra did.
[2:51:54] <Djinnazz> to blame it on them.
[2:51:57] <Jflaskd13> propaganda
[2:52:04] <+PartyTimeAustin> yup
[2:52:09] <+PartyTimeAustin> false flag 2
[2:52:16] <kiwicoffin> The plan is bigger than fucking up avalanche right?
[2:52:31] <+PartyTimeAustin> yea i think they wanna start a war or something
[2:52:32] <+wizard_of_diamonds> Quit stepping on your bed with your shoes on you shit
[2:52:34] <%CyberDingus> 2
[2:52:35] <BurdRightsActivist> Hingadinger is actually played by Wakka 4Head
[2:52:41] <IntrepidEye> He probably told them in front of 20 people while gafawing the entire time
[2:52:42] <hassanico2> If you don't answer fast enough he drops ya yup
[2:53:05] <terminusterminal> Is this guy one of the baby people from Yakuza
[2:53:06] <Josshoo> He's living his best life
[2:53:09] <Gavaline> What a chad
[2:53:09] <Huntercd> For five people?! That's like 10k for a dollar hamburger
[2:53:09] <KaiserMario> If only Leon was there...
[2:53:13] <tonfirean> Does he not drop you if you answer?
[2:53:23] <Jflaskd13> that was an option here too
[2:53:24] <+justianxix> He always drops you
[2:53:26] <hassanico2> @tonfirean still does it just flows differently
[2:53:29] <+TQuick101> he probably drops you regardless
[2:53:35] <Sokumotanaka> Why is he a cartoon?
[2:53:48] <+TeethMuncher> @terminusterminal game theory: Corneo into ABDL
[2:53:54] <GiygasDrillBreak> dropping the plate was to kill the poors, not avalanche
[2:54:06] <+TeethMuncher> Doing evil does feel good sometimes
[2:54:06] <nigawatts1988> They are trying to blame the drop on Avalanch
[2:54:07] <GiygasDrillBreak> and blame the plate fall on avalache
[2:54:07] <Jflaskd13> propaganda for wutia war it seems
[2:54:13] <nigawatts1988> the drop is to start a war
[2:54:15] <CitrousCt> Howdy Reeve
[2:54:15] <Paranoid_Jumbotron> the most logical would be shinra blaming avalanche for the plate dropping
[2:54:20] <+BKNPham> Keanu?
[2:54:20] <arkv01> reeves HOT
[2:54:23] <+justianxix> Well, in the end, don't they only care about Neo-midgar
[2:54:27] <Gavaline> Propaganda to motivate further control and expansion alongside war is the new motivation
[2:54:37] <Djinnazz> Except for Reeve's, Reeve is cool.
[2:54:44] <Jflaskd13> ya is new expansion
[2:54:44] <LunarRemix> I think it does, doesn't it?
[2:54:45] <CitrousCt> So just to recap, Cait Sith a robot controlled by Reeve right?
[2:54:47] <bevyrage> wutai was in the original but it was just
[2:54:49] <LunarRemix> Well never mind then
[2:54:50] <nigawatts1988> but Neo Midgar was a thing
[2:54:50] <BurdRightsActivist> Hey guys, I wonder who Caith Sith is. I heard he's controlled by someone, he's a robot after all. Just wondering, like who inside shinra's that nice? Hmmm
[2:54:51] <bevyrage> super super late in the original game
[2:54:53] <GiygasDrillBreak> yuffie and her father directly reference the war, in the original
[2:54:55] <%CyberDingus> I am SO evil
[2:54:56] <nigawatts1988> in the original
[2:54:56] <%CyberDingus> mmmmm
[2:54:58] <+wizard_of_diamonds> 'Someone ELSE'S sacrifice'
[2:54:58] <%CyberDingus> Meeeee
[2:55:03] <IntrepidEye> it does but there was only rare offhand references
[2:55:04] <arkv01> BIG evil
[2:55:05] <fluffy_sauce> yes , president skull face!
[2:55:08] <arkv01> also time for aps!
[2:55:09] <GeltonZ> I think the Wu-Tai thing was mentioned when they got to Wu-Tai and it was super minor and they've played it up a LOT here.
[2:55:09] <Huntercd> So what was the point in Rude saying he wasn't bad?
[2:55:12] <TechDragon_Z> Wutai war history with Shinra was all Yuffie side quest
[2:55:24] <%Rezca> their necks snapped
[2:55:26] <Zinax7> time ghosts? more like plotergeists
[2:55:36] <london_flexing> Rude is also an idiot is seems
[2:55:39] <nigawatts1988> you must make a choice
[2:55:44] <arkv01> pick your thot!
[2:55:49] <%Gogogolem> Tifa
[2:55:51] <+TQuick101> the hot one
[2:55:52] <TheWe4pon> Tifa
[2:55:52] <CitrousCt> So, were there any other cities like Midgar in the world?
[2:55:53] <Commissar_Cornflakes> Tifa
[2:55:54] <MilkingEdge> TitFA
[2:55:56] <Gavaline> Tifa
[2:55:57] <+wizard_of_diamonds> The pretty one
[2:55:57] <sosandstorm> @Zinax7 that's good
[2:55:57] <AxelCezar> Funbags obviously
[2:55:58] <OToole42> Tifa
[2:55:59] <Zinax7> touch em with your hardedge
[2:56:01] <+sal00nn> Pick best girl
[2:56:04] <+wizard_of_diamonds> Aerith obviously Kappa
[2:56:04] <Jflaskd13> tifa is strong Aerith needs help more
[2:56:04] <arkv01> get that thotty totty honkers
[2:56:08] <kiwicoffin> Put orbs in their slots while they're unconcious
[2:56:13] <TheWe4pon> Barret
[2:56:13] <notanegg8> which unconscious body do we roll in poo poo pee pee?
[2:56:17] <BurdRightsActivist> Imagine thirsting for Aerith, like unironically, holy shit that's cringe. Why would you be in love with a Pre-Corpse 4Head
[2:56:20] <nigawatts1988> the answer is always Tifa
[2:56:26] <Monkeyweed21> Erissu
[2:56:27] <Gavaline> Quick, massage their hands before they wake up
[2:56:30] <+wizard_of_diamonds> It sure does LUL
[2:56:33] <+TeethMuncher> Tifa and Aerith do rhyme
[2:56:33] <+BurkeBigsby> Well, cloud only bangs one in the OG while everyone watches from a blimp...
[2:56:35] <$jamarartdoodles> Airass
[2:56:35] <nigawatts1988> wait...look in around, I'm sure Jessie is lurking somewhere
[2:56:37] <arkv01> tifa requires you to cotinue her bloodline NOW
[2:56:42] <Zinax7> but aeris is a non investment
[2:56:43] <london_flexing> Gotta go fest
[2:56:44] <SuperVaderMan> Barrett's there, and he's in a dress now
[2:56:46] <london_flexing> fast
[2:56:47] <Berendenn> RED
[2:56:48] <+wizard_of_diamonds> @Gavaline Kazuma kazuma
[2:56:49] <+aspirationdeath> ew nasty aerith simps
[2:56:52] <Sokumotanaka> I remember in the famitsu it's stated that Reeve's limit break is the reason why he can control Cait Sith, it apparently is to control dolls and inanimate objects which means if reeve was desperate enough; he could have controlled a giant mech or some shit.
[2:56:53] <tonfirean> HK-47
[2:57:00] <kiwicoffin> And then Sora, Donald, and Goofy float down
[2:57:02] <BurdRightsActivist> AERITHS IS NOTHING MORE THAN A PRE-CORPSE 4Head
[2:57:10] <%Gogogolem> No.
[2:57:13] <%Gogogolem> not at all.
[2:57:15] <arkv01> aeris won't make it past nine months even if you mating press her now
[2:57:20] <+Atlaworks> I absolutely hope the eventual Cid has a "light dynamite with malboro reds" move
[2:57:22] <nigawatts1988> she's the Twitter Wendy's meme
[2:57:24] <bevyrage> she literally says 'because i'm so generous' as a personality trait
[2:57:25] <GeltonZ> I can see how Aerith can be nice, yeah...but this game just makes me want Jessie over both of 'em.
[2:57:28] <Sokumotanaka> @BurdRightsActivist We're ALL pre corpses
[2:57:29] <Monkeyweed21> gotta think long term investment
[2:57:29] <bevyrage> she's real heavy handed in remake
[2:57:30] <cyberblueneon> how do you know aeris will die in this version
[2:57:31] <%Gogogolem> I hate aerith more than ever.
[2:57:32] <+TQuick101> tits mcgee?
[2:57:32] <JohnClaggart> yes
[2:57:33] <JonKhan> long term planning
[2:57:34] <IntrepidEye> I like Aeris here but never could get attached to her in the original
[2:57:34] <+StreamStopA> wow bad end
[2:57:40] <+HawkGoggles2> Nah, I never liked the ditzy "good" girl.
[2:57:45] <examplez0> Nah I still prefer Tifa
[2:57:47] <+BurkeBigsby> Teetfa?
[2:57:56] <KaiserMario> I like the name "Knuckles" for Tifa
[2:57:57] <CitrousCt> @PlagueOfGripes What other FF game would you like to see remade? Hypothetically speaking at least
[2:58:01] <+eanscrale> hohoho
[2:58:03] <Zinax7> funbags funtasy?
[2:58:04] <Johnmaddened> LUL
[2:58:05] <notanegg8> tifa will always be beeforoni in my eyes
[2:58:05] <arkv01> funeral sized
[2:58:06] <+HawkGoggles2> Tifa is also really white bread, Give me Yuffie any day.
[2:58:07] <BurdRightsActivist> The best name for Aerith is SEAN BEAN 4hEAD
[2:58:07] <arkv01> oh No
[2:58:08] <examplez0> Aerith feels too much like a manic pixie dream girl
[2:58:08] <%JailShmixRemix> Goddamit plague
[2:58:10] <ahaegotrigger> OOF
[2:58:10] <Djinnazz> Shish-Cabab
[2:58:10] <arkv01> oh NONONO
[2:58:11] <+wizard_of_diamonds> SHE SAID THE D WORD PogChamp
[2:58:12] <+jetjagger222> :(
[2:58:16] <+BurkeBigsby> I called her "ImpaleBait"
[2:58:22] <coldarmracer> cant have funeral without fun
[2:58:24] <+jetjagger222> its the rancor!
[2:58:26] <arkv01> good boi incomin!
[2:58:29] <+wizard_of_diamonds> YOU WHAT
[2:58:36] <arkv01> absolute cutie
[2:58:36] <SuperVaderMan> Is this the don's rancor
[2:58:40] <BillieNoMates> Oh its Don Corneo's fetish
[2:58:40] <bevyrage> yeah she says she isn't some damsel in distress then falls off a ledge and swears
[2:58:42] <+RayDaug> The Rancor?!
[2:58:46] <+tymetak> every girl that talks to cloud in this game is like "so who you fukin anyway?"
[2:58:47] <BurdRightsActivist> TONGUE ACTION Kreygasm Kreygasm Kreygasm
[2:58:50] <slimbreadsticks> i dont like this sephiroth redesign
[2:58:52] <Monkeyweed21> hey its Mrs Corneo
[2:58:53] <YakumoYomi> I think it was GarbageNirvana in Pat's stream that came up with "Fist Bitch" for Tifa (as well as "Slum Thot" for Jessie).
[2:58:55] <arkv01> HE FLEXED
[2:58:56] <Jflaskd13> he posin
[2:58:59] <AxelCezar> that thing will goblin slayer the girls
[2:59:02] <Jflaskd13> Flex on 'em
[2:59:06] <examplez0> I really don't like how they turned Jessie into Rinoa
[2:59:10] <coldarmracer> charges into invisible wall
[2:59:10] <JohnClaggart> is this nioh 2 now?
[2:59:14] <Sokumotanaka> "My dog lives in the sewers."
[2:59:18] <CitrousCt> Why are all sewers in videogames so huge?
[2:59:22] <fluffy_sauce> FIRE!
[2:59:23] <GeltonZ> @examplez0 Oh come on she's a LOT better than Rinoa!
[2:59:35] <slimbreadsticks> japanese people do massive poops
[2:59:40] <examplez0> Not THAT much better
[2:59:46] <+tymetak> tounge whipped
[3:00:04] <Berendenn> Ill show you what I can do! -gets obliterated
[3:00:05] <Paranoid_Jumbotron> this remix is so good honestly
[3:00:10] <YakumoYomi> Has Plague been using Assess to exploit enemy weaknesses?
[3:00:12] <Berendenn> yep thats about right
[3:00:12] <examplez0> But it's true that she's at least capable of doing things by herself
[3:00:38] <bevyrage> the chance to avoid it is knocking him off the wall
[3:00:39] <xrolenks> aeris is already almost ded lol
[3:00:40] <BurdRightsActivist> streamer bad
[3:00:49] <bevyrage> it's a time to throw magic at him
[3:00:51] <Sokumotanaka> Weird how you never see one of these in the wild yet this is a "pet"
[3:00:59] <CitrousCt> I wonder chat, will Yuffie still be wearing her shorts unzipped?
[3:00:59] <london_flexing> Assess before you died
[3:01:00] <xrolenks> heal her quick
[3:01:07] <bevyrage> you see these guys in the wild though?
[3:01:09] <arkv01> @CitrousCt absolutely
[3:01:13] <bevyrage> they're mid-late game in the original
[3:01:14] <Berendenn> honestly a lot of grab attacks are just time for you to wail on the boss easily
[3:01:18] <BurdRightsActivist> Aerith, just get impaled and drop your corpse on it. You'll kit much faster!
[3:01:19] <arkv01> there's lewder things than unzipped shorts in this game
[3:01:25] <examplez0> This game doesn't have the tightest controls
[3:01:39] <sosandstorm> he very slightly moves his hands
[3:01:41] <xrolenks> just get ready to run when he does that
[3:01:42] <Djinnazz> show fire at him when he's up there.
[3:01:45] <+fizzguy47> Sometimes you just gotta guard
[3:01:47] <bevyrage> maybe hit him with magic, which was a big weakness of his in original
[3:01:50] <sosandstorm> and then fucking shunpos onto you
[3:01:57] <examplez0> Just use assess on him already
[3:01:58] <xrolenks> heal cloud
[3:02:12] <BurdRightsActivist> FUNKO POP CHOCOBO PogChamp
[3:02:14] <mapimb> please stop trying to dodge all the time
[3:02:26] <CitrousCt> Like a chocobo and Moogle had a babbie
[3:02:26] <slimbreadsticks> the chocobo chick reborn
[3:02:28] <mapimb> it aint like kh
[3:02:30] <arkv01> this chocobo abortion only has 2 minutes to live
[3:02:31] <YakumoYomi> I HATE how Choco Chick and Carbuncle have giant heads
[3:02:40] <xrolenks> run dude
[3:02:46] <Sokumotanaka> My mom says the same about me plague
[3:02:46] <examplez0> The friendly AI is pathetically bad
[3:02:50] <BillieNoMates> FROM THE TOP ROPE
[3:02:54] <examplez0> They're literally just standing there holding block
[3:03:06] <CitrousCt> Are chocobos raised as food in this universe?
[3:03:11] <slimbreadsticks> nightmare slain
[3:03:13] <+fizzguy47> If you're gonna get attacked, switch characters
[3:03:18] <kiwicoffin> that seems like a sad summon
[3:03:21] <arkv01> WEW DAMAGE
[3:03:39] <Mythundare> :(
[3:03:46] <arkv01> sadness also makes you take half damage in the OG
[3:03:48] <arkv01> not sure if thats the case here
[3:03:58] <medril07> hehe
[3:04:01] <eyezehuhh> !uptime
[3:04:01] <@Nightbot> 3 hours 4 minutes 11 seconds
[3:04:14] <medril07> focused thrust behind him
[3:04:44] <+fizzguy47> you'll see
[3:04:51] <arkv01> this guy is Leviathan of the sewers
[3:05:15] <Berendenn> move called triple charge, surprised when theres three charges
[3:05:17] <arkv01> I'm slightly disappointed they didn't keep the original translation aps
[3:05:19] <xrolenks> heal quick
[3:06:11] <xrolenks> healer down!
[3:06:12] <Zinax7> btw guys how is mr. plague enjoying the game?
[3:06:28] <+TQuick101> likes some parts, doesn't like others
[3:06:36] <xrolenks> limit heal
[3:07:09] <xrolenks> also i hate when one party member is low the whole screen has to get all red
[3:07:09] <+azure22900> magnify is clutch when paired with healing materia
[3:07:11] <sosandstorm> Yeah he takes a hand off then Mankind's you from on top of the cell
[3:07:12] <Zinax7> how about pat does anyone know?
[3:07:14] <xrolenks> like i get it
[3:07:24] <sosandstorm> I guess you spam dodge then?
[3:07:24] <BurdRightsActivist> This combat seems mildly difficult, is it like dark souls?
[3:07:43] <Berendenn> stop getting killed and you wont have to heal as much tho
[3:07:45] <Zinax7> I know right, i feel that the battle system is not perfect
[3:07:58] <BillieNoMates> heres your tidal wave
[3:08:01] <Zinax7> but some people say it's flawless
[3:08:02] <BurdRightsActivist> look at the COOM water
[3:08:04] <vincerocmm> oh no slim frams
[3:08:07] <BillieNoMates> AHM COOMIN
[3:08:10] <$doomp12> big special sewer princess
[3:08:13] <+lojack69> refreshing as it is to watch a stream where someones NOT praising damn well everything, couldn't he at least complain about things that are actually bad?
[3:08:15] <+fizzguy47> @zinax7 He's being sponsored, so he'd better have only nice things to say
[3:08:44] <Zinax7> @fizzguy47 I thought that was only an inside joke?
[3:09:03] <xrolenks> campy bosses
[3:09:04] <+TeethMuncher> Gotta lean your patterns
[3:09:05] <london_flexing> Nice
[3:09:08] <vincerocmm> aqaaaahhh my horn
[3:09:18] <arkv01> good boy lives!
[3:09:19] <BurdRightsActivist> GAME IS GOOD BTW, 9/11 GENIUS NONUMBO DID IT AGAIN
[3:09:21] <Zinax7> it's kingdom hearts super bosses with tanky hp
[3:09:22] <Berendenn> if you block you get to counterattack more
[3:09:25] <Djinnazz> just gotta know when to capitalize
[3:09:28] <BillieNoMates> Nah he's out
[3:09:30] <Gavaline> Consoomer's think everything is either a 10/10 or a 1/10. This is a pretty soulless remake and the big changes are atrocious, but the little character moments are pretty good. Combat seems to be hit or miss.
[3:09:32] <BillieNoMates> "cya nerds"
[3:09:33] <+HawkGoggles2> I"m going home.
[3:09:34] <SirMcSlushy> Just fucks off xD
[3:09:36] <@dcn2049> lame
[3:09:39] <+ATorL> I DON'T WANT TO PLAY WITH YOU ANYMORE
[3:09:41] <+aspirationdeath> should try staggering more. theres a whole mechanic to dps dumping
[3:09:52] <Djinnazz> souless?
[3:09:56] <+Fatemaster> Rancor fails again!
[3:10:06] <terminusterminal> It's also a PR nightmare.
[3:10:10] <Frozen_phoenix> "cause we're just sooooo evil!!"
[3:10:12] <BurdRightsActivist> @Sokumotanaka I'm @ing you because you didn't say so lmao get shidded on
[3:10:24] <TheWe4pon> dont worry they got insurance from shinra insurance corp.
[3:10:25] <JonKhan> Don
[3:10:27] <GiygasDrillBreak> you're right, Plague, it IS stupid for Lucky Larry to throw 2 jet planes into his newly acquired twin towers
[3:10:28] <snowmanse> Like trying to make an omelette by dropping a section of the city on top of another section of the city.
[3:10:30] <+BKNPham> man tifa is really "glowing"
[3:10:31] <+TeethMuncher> Gives Shinra to build an even higher plate city
[3:11:03] <LunarRemix> Just follow Wedge's fat smell lol
[3:11:05] <Monkeyweed21> follow the smell of Barret
[3:11:06] <Sokumotanaka> @BurdRightsActivist I literally said dont what do you mean I didn't say so?
[3:11:19] <Zinax7> how did plague feel about some of the padding?
[3:11:22] <JohnClaggart> this is pretty low water flow for a huge place like midgar
[3:11:24] <Sokumotanaka> Also why'd I get timed out for being right?
[3:11:33] <MilkingEdge> poop monsters
[3:11:33] <+BKNPham> but punch girl
[3:11:34] <cerazor01> Did we see HELL HOUSE yet?
[3:11:34] <Djinnazz> Not rue
[3:11:37] <BurdRightsActivist> sewer level ResidentSleeper
[3:11:41] <Futurecity10> Oh, its those things from FF14
[3:11:55] <+TeethMuncher> Idk, big tiddie mage has it's merits
[3:11:57] <Djinnazz> these things hit hard btw
[3:12:16] <Berendenn> sahagin have permanent super armor for some reason
[3:12:18] <BlueSpartan119> LUL
[3:12:18] <medril07> hehehe
[3:12:20] <MilkingEdge> ninja turtle
[3:12:22] <Zinax7> oh he did a goofy dance
[3:12:23] <BillieNoMates> The LONGEST death animation
[3:12:42] <Sokumotanaka> Take that turtle in a halfshell
[3:13:04] <Monkeyweed21> Morlocks need boxes too
[3:13:11] <xrolenks> most stun stuff sucks imo spam braver and triple-slash because triple-slash can help you dodge multiple enemies and braver is just kinda good
[3:13:11] <Zinax7> the dreaded sewer level
[3:13:31] <@Nightbot> Plague is a youtube animator and also streams at https://picarto.tv/Plague . Also: t-shirts! http://goo.gl/lze8QO
[3:13:44] <Zinax7> which one is the good padding and which one is the bad
[3:13:48] <Zinax7> that's the question here
[3:13:49] <examplez0> It's even more linear than the original
[3:13:57] <Kampler21> cinematic/automated too
[3:14:06] <cerazor01> is the secret boss here
[3:14:09] <examplez0> You're constantly gated off from going in any direction the game doesn't want you to go
[3:14:19] <Kampler21> in terms of moving around the overview
[3:14:31] <Kampler21> overworld*
[3:14:32] <MilkingEdge> gloves cover in poop
[3:14:43] <Gavaline> @PlagueOfGripes For what conceivable reason would you think this will be better on replay? Familiarity with the combat system?
[3:14:57] <examplez0> Is it even possible to learn any new limit breaks
[3:15:05] <Berendenn> yes
[3:15:12] <examplez0> Because I haven't seen any
[3:15:22] <examplez0> And I've already beaten the game
[3:15:25] <Berendenn> you get them from the colosseum
[3:15:34] <examplez0> Oh
[3:15:38] <examplez0> That makes sense
[3:15:42] <+silvery_cricket> Almost like turning a RPG into a Action game isn't a good idea.
[3:15:52] <examplez0> I never did the coliseum outside of mandatory battles
[3:15:52] <medril07> for later puzzles probably
[3:16:02] <Berendenn> and you can learn abilities in 1-3 fights its super fast
[3:16:13] <+lojack69> Midgar was a pretty linear part of the original game, in that sense this is perfect for it
[3:16:14] <Sokumotanaka> What do you ecpect? This is made by the ff13 cast of workers, they only know how to do linier
[3:16:29] <+HawkGoggles2> Nah, fuck us do what you want.
[3:16:31] <+lojack69> though it does have me worried for the other parts
[3:16:45] <examplez0> At least the original Midgar didn't constantly stop you from going anywhere the game didn't want you to go at the moment
[3:16:48] <cyberblueneon> its almost like dragging a 5 hour segment of a game to 30 hours is a terrible idea
[3:16:56] <Zinax7> wasn't the original also linear at the earlier parts of midgar?
[3:16:56] <+zombieghost1337> LP tax is why i would never be a content creator, it seems exhausting
[3:17:06] <+lojack69> it let you go there, just that there was nothing to find
[3:17:08] <Djinnazz> yeah
[3:17:10] <examplez0> You're free to move between areas you've already visited except for the reactors for obvious reasons
[3:17:18] <+silvery_cricket> The enemy variety in the remake feels lesser
[3:17:22] <+sund0wner> Well ahhhhh
[3:17:27] <%CyberDingus> @PlagueOfGripes are you sure?
[3:17:29] <$studleydoorite> lots of people want that, Pat's stream is very popular
[3:17:30] <+TQuick101> No one say a thing
[3:17:31] <examplez0> In the remake you're stuck along a single path
[3:17:37] <%JailShmixRemix> Kappa some people do
[3:17:38] <Daxalog> Like a moba streamer
[3:17:53] <+zombieghost1337> i have noticed a reupsurge of "silent" LP's
[3:17:54] <MilkingEdge> Scratch your nuts plague we demand it
[3:17:58] <+zombieghost1337> unironically
[3:17:59] <Zinax7> if there's no construction sign enemy in the shinra building then i'm out
[3:18:02] <+machinetoys> I mean we can't see the lower half of you so you could get away with it
[3:18:19] <+sund0wner> Faaaaackin' Tifa
[3:18:26] <examplez0> I've never actually watched a SBF stream or LP
[3:18:39] <+Punishedkaiger> The crab is immune to fire damage I think, and Tifa has fire linked split damage
[3:18:40] <examplez0> I'm only interested in Plague's stream since he's a FF7 purist like myself
[3:18:52] <Gavaline> ^ based
[3:19:24] <examplez0> I just love watching him rant about every single change in the story
[3:19:27] <$jamarartdoodles> Plus when streaming the crowd don't have the best attention span
[3:19:35] <+sund0wner> At least he's well-informed
[3:19:38] <Zinax7> man recently purist has been on the crosshairs for people who love the game
[3:19:39] <examplez0> And his reactions to all the stupid shit like the moogle kid
[3:19:39] <KaiserMario> @examplez0 I don't think he's a "purist" he's just critical of it
[3:19:42] <examplez0> That was gold
[3:19:42] <+sund0wner> Knows what he's talking about
[3:20:00] <Zinax7> or rather people who are critical are labeled as such
[3:20:03] <MilkingEdge> Grab their asses cloud
[3:20:20] <+sund0wner> "SHIT'S CRAZY"
[3:20:41] <examplez0> Fair enough
[3:20:41] <$doomp12> self awareness doesn't make it better though
[3:20:45] <Djinnazz> It's Greed.
[3:20:51] <+TeethMuncher> The benefit is screwing over poor people
[3:20:51] <+crowmium> FF15 wasn't nearly as linear as this
[3:20:58] <JohnClaggart> stamp is progression, right?
[3:21:00] <examplez0> I couldn't give less of a shit if I'm in the crosshairs for being a purist
[3:21:06] <Zinax7> in the original there were 4 scenario writers: order (sakaguchi, kitase) and chaos (kazuhige and nomura)
[3:21:10] <$studleydoorite> if I was a woman I would grab men's hands with my ass
[3:21:16] <examplez0> Especially after the ending to this remake which I won't spoil here
[3:21:17] <Zinax7> but now we're left with only kazuhige
[3:21:43] <london_flexing> Plus killing a friction of your work force before building the damn city is extra stupid
[3:21:49] <+machinetoys> that's modern square writing riding in a nutshell
[3:21:52] <examplez0> In fact I wouldn't be a purist if all the FF7 spinoffs weren't complete and utter cringe
[3:22:00] <+crowmium> @examplez0 don't play squenix games, falcom are the RPG purists now
[3:22:09] <KaiserMario> @examplez0 I myself am agreeing a lot with his gripes with this Remake, but I don't have any strong feelings towards the original
[3:22:21] <Zinax7> ff7 dirge of cerberus: imma end this purist's career
[3:22:27] <Berendenn> They counter when theyre using guard
[3:22:43] <GeltonZ> I'm just amused by the idea that the purists were the Time Ghosts all along!
[3:22:47] <examplez0> @crowmium Any recommendations? I've only played Trails in the Sky FC
[3:22:51] <MilkingEdge> item downbelow
[3:22:51] <london_flexing> Crabs auto-parry is a very Japanese game thing
[3:23:04] <examplez0> EXACTLY
[3:23:11] <examplez0> It's the lesser of the two shitpiles
[3:23:17] <+lojack69> Goes to show, they really should have given the remake to a game people didn't trick themselves into believing was perfect in the first place
[3:23:21] <Sol_Install> Plague has been the best for me cause there no rose-tinted glasses all the way through tbh
[3:23:27] <+fizzguy47> and Gackt
[3:23:28] <+crowmium> all the Trails are great, I'm paying through CS3 now and played everything before that
[3:23:35] <+TeethMuncher> Not bad round up to being good
[3:23:38] <Gavaline> Some people also liked that one phone game about the turks if I remember
[3:23:39] <Sol_Install> cause I saw many spoilers that made me just go "Wtf?"
[3:23:41] <examplez0> @KaiserMario yeah it's just dumb either way
[3:23:44] <Zinax7> shouldn't pat be the same as well?
[3:23:46] <Commissar_Cornflakes> THANK YOU
[3:23:47] <GeltonZ> Man I hate how much Crisis Core makes people hate Gackt. Bujingai is amazing.
[3:23:54] <Commissar_Cornflakes> Sonic Adventure a shit.
[3:23:54] <sosandstorm> No one says sonic adventure one is a good game, right?
[3:23:58] <arran_throttle> but the ending was cool
[3:24:02] <sosandstorm> that can't be true
[3:24:04] <sosandstorm> surely
[3:24:06] <GeltonZ> @sosandstorm Lots of people do.
[3:24:07] <Sol_Install> I like SA2 was fun
[3:24:13] <+TeethMuncher> @sosandstorm shh, you'll draw them out
[3:24:18] <examplez0> I'm literally baffled by how people can hate the original FF7 but love Crisis Core
[3:24:21] <GeltonZ> I prefer SA1 over SA2. I hated the forced characters anmd how they ruined Chao.
[3:24:21] <examplez0> I mean yeah Zack is cool
[3:24:24] <Zinax7> does anyone here like shadow hearts?
[3:24:24] <Kampler21> I like SA1 and SA2 Kappa
[3:24:25] <MilkingEdge> rolling around at the speed of sound
[3:24:28] <KaiserMario> @Sol_Install Exactly, I love Max, but his overt bias just makes me not agree with his playthrough of this
[3:24:28] <examplez0> But that doesn't mean shit if the rest of the game sucks ass
[3:24:50] <examplez0> I like Max but he's hardcore shilling for this remake
[3:25:06] <Sol_Install> God... there's so much filler...
[3:25:12] <Zinax7> just watch max break down from the supposed ending
[3:25:16] <GeltonZ> @examplez0 I'm curious to see what happens to Max in the end. There are some who love the game all the way until the last hour.
[3:25:30] <+lojack69> Since when was dungeon crawling in an RPG considered filler?
[3:25:30] <AxelCezar> couldn't cloud just super jump there with the girls?
[3:25:32] <oshkeet41> yeah the dolphin tail
[3:25:43] <GeltonZ> Yeah especially because-EXACTLY! It's called a Dolphin Tail!
[3:25:44] <Gavaline> At least the spread of time ghost bad writing jokes means FF7's death wasn't completely accepted
[3:25:50] <MilkingEdge> they can't afford it
[3:25:52] <Sol_Install> These rats did nothing wrong
[3:25:54] <+TeethMuncher> @AxelCezar that doesn't net your xp though
[3:25:55] <seth45er> Tifa is a dolphin Girl
[3:26:17] <GeltonZ> Haha yeah...Dolphin Girl...hahaha *sweats profusely*
[3:26:17] <seth45er> obsessed with dolphins
[3:26:23] <+TeethMuncher> What?
[3:26:26] <MilkingEdge> bonic bonkers
[3:26:26] <BillieNoMates> going senile
[3:26:30] <GalaxyUni> ?????
[3:26:31] <AxelCezar> DEM BONKERS THO
[3:26:33] <GeltonZ> BONIC BONKERS! Yes. I approve.
[3:26:37] <+TeethMuncher> Go to bed, plague
[3:26:37] <notanegg8> tifa's big bonic bonkers
[3:26:37] <oshkeet41> would absolutely wear monk gear called Bonic Bonkers
[3:26:39] <arkv01> you require more boinkers, it's natural
[3:26:39] <JohnClaggart> oh no, eli is getting hit by the time ghosts on stream
[3:26:45] <terminusterminal> Having a weird sleep cycle causes long term brain damage as you get older
[3:26:46] <KaiserMario> @examplez0 I don't think he's shilling, but he's borderline blinded by his nostalgia... Plague is able to enjoy it while not giving the dumbness a pass
[3:26:48] <Gavaline> You associate Tifa with a word that has two b's in it
[3:26:48] <%Gogogolem> No.
[3:26:51] <Gavaline> Yes
[3:26:51] <sosandstorm> That's the same part of your brain where the art comes from probably
[3:26:51] <+Blue_Que> Blue_Que subscribed with Twitch Prime. 
[3:26:53] <+TeethMuncher> Bonk Busters
[3:26:55] <GeltonZ> I remember Bonkers. Yeah.
[3:26:57] <london_flexing> Mean that cartoon was shit,
[3:26:59] <transporterthesequel> Oh god I do remember Bonkers
[3:27:01] <sosandstorm> bonkers, heh
[3:27:01] <$jamarartdoodles> Sock em Boppers
[3:27:08] <Zinax7> i feel at home in this stream
[3:27:16] <+kenuran> Miranda
[3:27:17] <Zinax7> not to say i hated the game
[3:27:24] <examplez0> @GeltonZ should be interesting
[3:27:25] <oshkeet41> Miranda Wright, cheesy name
[3:27:28] <london_flexing> It was Roger Rabbit, but a bobcat
[3:27:29] <+TeethMuncher> So a Paul Blart?
[3:27:29] <arkv01> hot piece of ass was the right choice
[3:27:35] <oshkeet41> Piquel
[3:27:39] <+TeethMuncher> relatable
[3:27:40] <oshkeet41> geez how do i remember that.
[3:27:44] <arran_throttle> so it was a copy of Roger Rabbit?
[3:27:51] <oshkeet41> Arran: broad strokes
[3:27:52] <GeltonZ> @examplez0 QUITE. I'm watching both streams. I'm not a big FF7 guy, but I understand the feelings of purists being one for oh so many other series.
[3:27:54] <Zinax7> instead of putting resource into this extended sewer section
[3:28:03] <Zinax7> i wish they put more into the free roam
[3:28:03] <GeltonZ> @arran_throttle It was literally meant to be a Roger Rabbit series originally.
[3:28:09] <+kenuran> I remember myself liking Lucky more than Miranda when i saw that show
[3:28:19] <arran_throttle> hah, interestng
[3:28:29] <oshkeet41> I mean Lucky was a sourpuss so he was funny cause Bonkers was annoying. Think Squidward situation
[3:28:32] <+TeethMuncher> Is Tifa drunk?
[3:28:48] <$studleydoorite> crabs won't just go away you have to use shampoo
[3:29:00] <london_flexing> Nice
[3:29:16] <Zinax7> barret inflicted by blind: Aaw shit I can't see! how am i supposed to see Marlene's face now.
[3:29:59] <+TeethMuncher> Isn't that for loading?
[3:30:34] <arkv01> they don't want people to farm the first run I guess
[3:30:38] <tonfirean> Is "whenever" a word with regional usage variation? I would usually say "when" whenever Plague says "whenever".
[3:30:56] <oshkeet41> One thing I wish was the Bad Status icons were a bit bigger, sometimes theyre hard to see
[3:30:59] <tonfirean> I've heard Paige use it the same way too.
[3:31:07] <tolloponik> she can't help that she's so rufiable
[3:31:10] <Sol_Install> the stagger system?
[3:31:22] <arkv01> @tonfirean 'arbitrarily'
[3:31:28] <KaiserMario> @PlagueOfGripes In FFXV they had a whistle, or something like that, jus make enemies respawn at your location. Maybe they should've added that
[3:31:37] <Zinax7> wait
[3:31:39] <Sol_Install> I feel the stagger system is fine tbh
[3:31:43] <Zinax7> how do you grind in this game?
[3:32:19] <+aspirationdeath> @zinax7 mobs respawn
[3:32:21] <Kampler21> You should be able to waggle your joystick to get out of stun
[3:33:24] <Zinax7> huh so not as fast as a regular random encounter?
[3:33:34] <arkv01> absolutely hate the joystick waggle mechanic, it kills gamepads
[3:33:42] <@Nightbot> Plague is a youtube animator and also streams at https://picarto.tv/Plague . Also: t-shirts! http://goo.gl/lze8QO
[3:34:08] <+aspirationdeath> @zinax7 no. it feels kinda like mmo grinding
[3:34:34] <Djinnazz> yeah it does, it steals MP
[3:34:43] <Djinnazz> and it raises stagger
[3:34:47] <arkv01> I guess there's not much incentive to use aeris when she's born to die
[3:35:01] <+lojack69> Using the mage for anything but casting spells is a bad idea in most games
[3:35:02] <cyberblueneon> aeris probably wont even die in this version
[3:35:09] <+lojack69> not sure why this should be different
[3:35:24] <+fizzguy47> You are meant to grind in the endgame
[3:35:35] <+StreamStopA> Have you tried resting at a bonfire?
[3:36:00] <Zinax7> I'm curious if the next part
[3:36:10] <Gavaline> Does exiting and restarting the game near a bench force respawns?
[3:36:10] <Zinax7> people will start at the level they ended with
[3:36:30] <+aspirationdeath> no way
[3:36:55] <cerazor01> They're respawning because of mating season
[3:37:00] <Zinax7> or maybe they'll just increase the lvl soft cap
[3:37:06] <arkv01> I want the next episode to give aeris a line if you grinded her too much, "Wew cloud, you should probably grind everyone else now haha, I need a break!"
[3:37:26] <+aspirationdeath> theyd never risk missing out on people buying the game that didnt play the first one. theyre all completely stand alone
[3:37:33] <Djinnazz> Cuz ppl are idiots
[3:37:38] <AxelCezar> dumb down = more customers
[3:37:47] <+TeethMuncher> It's for people who haven't gamed since the 90's
[3:37:47] <Djinnazz> and will complain if they;re balls aren't copped.
[3:37:52] <%JailShmixRemix> Artificial depth
[3:37:54] <trigglypuf> plagueImoya
[3:38:05] <Zinax7> hand holding = quality of life lel
[3:38:07] <tolloponik> @PlagueOfGripes remember the Bloodborn E3 ladder problem
[3:38:07] <Gavaline> Just wait - the final level cap after FF7 remake 4 will be raised to something like 200 to show just how much better Cloud and crew are compared to vanilla 7 and hammer in the overcoming destiny aspect
[3:38:19] <$jamarartdoodles> Maintenance is shit in this sewer plant
[3:38:37] <+RayDaug> It's easier to design encounters that are "puzzles" than systems and enemies that can interact organically
[3:38:40] <Kampler21> I wonder if we're gonna get dlc
[3:38:44] <Zinax7> i've always wondered about the powerl level progression in ff7
[3:39:01] <Zinax7> in the original it was super hard for us to fight against even midgar zoloom
[3:39:04] <AxelCezar> gotta go fast
[3:39:18] <Zinax7> but in this game we seem to already fight world ending bosses
[3:39:46] <+HawkGoggles2> This is the third time Tifa, we've talked about this.
[3:39:49] <+TeethMuncher> Tifa, please
[3:39:57] <Zinax7> oh shit
[3:39:57] <slimbreadsticks> theres a little something for everybody
[3:40:11] <Zinax7> aerith having a final destination moment
[3:40:14] <+zombieghost1337> INB4 i cant swim
[3:40:17] <Gavaline> Time ghosts you're up!
[3:40:23] <arkv01> haha wel...
[3:40:24] <+Mashuukitty> that comes later shiaSmug
[3:40:27] <arkv01> well now...
[3:40:34] <@dcn2049> sephiroth is gonna fly out of the poo water
[3:40:40] <Zinax7> 2 hours later
[3:40:41] <$studleydoorite> the TENSION
[3:40:49] <+TeethMuncher> Can't believe Aerith drowned to death
[3:40:49] <+Mashuukitty> they wanted to make the two girls hug
[3:40:50] <KaiserMario> Stall for time
[3:40:54] <%Gogogolem> The point was so Aeirth could get all up in them tiddies.
[3:40:57] <SupportWriter> to ship aerith x tifa!
[3:40:59] <Kampler21> padding Kappa
[3:41:02] <luckycloud91> she could have died man
[3:41:03] <Johnmaddened> idiot-proofing
[3:41:04] <TheWe4pon> why was that cutscene so long?
[3:41:09] <seth45er> their friends now scene
[3:41:13] <AxelCezar> now they are friends, cloud can have both mousieWOW
[3:41:20] <Gavaline> Because then you might have time to think about the plot and realize the issues with it
[3:41:22] <Zinax7> we want you to play how we want you to
[3:41:24] <+TeethMuncher> Padding, plague
[3:41:25] <+zombieghost1337> Aerith only wants cloud if he in a dress tbh
[3:41:26] <TheWe4pon> is this the Normura touch?
[3:41:27] <+RayDaug> because everyone complained that JRPGs are too grindy. Got to streamline
[3:41:28] <tonfirean> What was she even trying to say to Cloud?
[3:41:44] <+TeethMuncher> No fun, only nostalgia
[3:41:45] <+BurkeBigsby> Because they want you to see the pretty straight hallways and immerse yourself in amazing writing
[3:41:50] <Hydrapissed> FeelsBadMan cvHazmat
[3:41:51] <Zinax7> HERE WE GO
[3:41:52] <zbanichar> But the character development, plague
[3:41:52] <GiygasDrillBreak> plague keeps slamming headfirst into a wall that Square is terrible at programming
[3:41:58] <JonKhan> Because the plate is going to fall!!! Move foreward!!
[3:42:04] <+aspirationdeath> cutscene to load the next area and circumstances to prevent you to going to the unloaded area
[3:42:10] <Gavaline> DIILY DALLY AERITH
[3:42:15] <+Mashuukitty> Now kiss.
[3:42:17] <+RayDaug> COASTERS
[3:42:18] <$studleydoorite> I hate them
[3:42:19] <KaiserMario> @PlagueOfGripes The Bloodborne E3 ladder is that first ladder in the game, people cound't find the lever you needed to pull to bring it down, so they couldn't progress... like idiots
[3:42:20] <+OneGorillionDollars> Still thinking about the destruction of your home, bar, most the people you knew? just think of something happy!
[3:42:27] <arkv01> yeah, girrrls!
[3:42:28] <notanegg8> is that line from the original or is it alluding to them messing with whether aerith dies
[3:42:32] <mrjplays2k9> eli make you bed
[3:42:34] <arkv01> fuck off femdick, girls only!
[3:42:36] <Zinax7> oh no
[3:42:37] <oshkeet41> Aeris upgraded
[3:42:52] <Zinax7> 2nd backtracking foil
[3:42:56] <slimbreadsticks> sistas are doing it for themselves
[3:42:56] <dmdyne99> Uh oh, sounds like a setup for failure
[3:42:57] <+BurkeBigsby> Why would Tifa like Aerith, who is her obvious competition?
[3:43:01] <Zinax7> the twist
[3:43:04] <GentleJovian> cloud sure spends a lot of time falling, should call him Rain
[3:43:12] <tonfirean> Wow, it would have been mildly inconvenient if he had fallen those 10 feet
[3:43:13] <JonKhan> The plate is going to fall like that bridge
[3:43:15] <+zombieghost1337> these last few cutscenes are really out of place
[3:43:16] <+TeethMuncher> What was the point of that?
[3:43:18] <+lojack69> He can totally jump that though
[3:43:20] <oshkeet41> idk them liking each other instead of it being weird compettive stuff is refreshin
[3:43:21] <AxelCezar> wtf is the problem, this dude can jump a skyscrapper
[3:43:22] <$studleydoorite> this game is a weird sequence
[3:43:23] <TheWe4pon> what is with these useless cutscenes?
[3:43:28] <Hydrapissed> Paaaaaaaaaaaaadddddiiiiinggggggggg
[3:43:30] <mrjplays2k9> theres really no real need to backtrack anywhere in this game
[3:43:35] <arkv01> they're trying to give T and A a more friendly rapport so they can eventually have a civil negotiation over the rights to cloud's seed
[3:43:35] <+HawkGoggles2> What's going on? What happened? Why are we even here.
[3:43:37] <+zombieghost1337> you know though this reminds of how fuckign awkward old japanese games are
[3:43:48] <Phoenixianstyle> hey yeah... cloud could totally jump that lol
[3:43:52] <+broth_elemental> Oh just you wait plague
[3:43:52] <+OneGorillionDollars> I feel like some of these cutscenes could just be banter while you are actually going through this section
[3:43:53] <tonfirean> Yeah, the game opened with him front-flipping off a train and that was a bigger jump than that.
[3:43:58] <Hydrapissed> cloud can jump that
[3:44:03] <Gavaline> Got to shove in forced characterization and bonding moments regardless of story beats or pressing matters
[3:44:04] <Zinax7> don't question it
[3:44:06] <Zinax7> consume
[3:44:10] <MilkingEdge> women like to gossip
[3:44:10] <+zombieghost1337> is the water toxic?
[3:44:15] <+broth_elemental> It gets worse
[3:44:15] <+TeethMuncher> @tonfirean and then he super jumps in the original reactor
[3:44:15] <slimbreadsticks> cloud can lay his sword across it and walk over
[3:44:19] <Futurecity10> Oh you have no idea
[3:44:22] <Hydrapissed> that to
[3:44:24] <Gavaline> His name is Nomura
[3:44:29] <arkv01> plague you forget the original game was almost as stupid
[3:44:31] <BurdRightsActivist> @zombieghost1337 not as toxic as the fandom 4Head
[3:44:35] <arkv01> minus the time ghosts
[3:44:38] <Sol_Install> I can't just blame nomura
[3:44:49] <+BurkeBigsby> Can't wait to see how they handle fractured cripple cloud in 8 years for part 3.
[3:44:51] <cyberblueneon> they can survive a 10 story fall without injuries but god forbid they fall into that puddle
[3:44:59] <+aspirationdeath> i imagine a lot of it is technical issues theyve found contrived methods of covering up. modern game dev in a nutshell
[3:45:01] <tonfirean> Look at Cloud manspreading across the whole bench
[3:45:01] <@dcn2049> especially if orphans get involved
[3:45:04] <Zinax7> nomura: they did me wrong with ff13 versus, now it's PAYBACK
[3:45:05] <+OneGorillionDollars> I think the last section in this game like that is the most egregious
[3:45:10] <%CyberDingus> @cyberblueneon it is a puddle of DEATH
[3:45:12] <tonfirean> Left no room for the women to sit; typical.
[3:45:16] <KaiserMario> Oh Plague... You better toughen up, there's still plenty of stupid to come
[3:45:22] <+TeethMuncher> Sora had better show up at some poimt
[3:45:31] <GiygasDrillBreak> Fun Fact: Nomura didn't know he was the director of this game in its first year of development
[3:45:35] <london_flexing> Steel yourself to the stupid
[3:45:41] <+StreamStopA> The water effects are too hard on the ps4.
[3:45:46] <medril07> no
[3:45:54] <AxelCezar> it seems like the snowball of stupid is getting bigger and bigger
[3:45:55] <GalaxyUni> @GiygasDrillBreak Seriously??
[3:46:00] <Gavaline> No, but Nomura is the face of the remake. The team itself as well as SQuenix's leadership are all responsible for the product they released.
[3:46:11] <%bettysharkface> Having never played the original, and knowing this is mostly based on it, I am still left wondering why this game was so hyped up.
[3:46:25] <GiygasDrillBreak> Nomura directed KH3, he asks Kitase who is directing Remake, Kitase says "lol you are"
[3:46:36] <BurdRightsActivist> @bettysharkface Maxmillian Clown
[3:46:36] <arkv01> @bettysharkface nostalgia
[3:46:40] <SupportWriter> Cause peoiple thought it was gonna be a 1:1 remaster
[3:46:45] <Zinax7> what has kitase been doing actually?
[3:46:54] <+aspirationdeath> im so excited for a new console gen thats more obsessed with new fast load tech than fidelity over all else
[3:46:54] <+TeethMuncher> @bettysharkface nostalgia and mounting mystique
[3:47:00] <+FrenchTact1cs> Wonder why the most anticipated game ever was hyped up
[3:47:07] <Zinax7> @PlagueOfGripes how do you feel about roche?
[3:47:17] <notanegg8> trailers made this game look really good. the overall tone is a lot different than what i was expecting
[3:47:20] <AxelCezar> and two big bonkers...
[3:47:33] <CursedNobleman> hmm... i wonder if modern graphics hurts RPGs. having to reuse assets and enemies makes it harder to design different areas and stuff
[3:47:35] <arkv01> yeah, butterfingers!
[3:47:39] <+TeethMuncher> They even ran commercials during Conan
[3:47:58] <+RayDaug> It was kind of the Mario 64 of RPGs
[3:48:03] <GiygasDrillBreak> "Yeah it just means the people remaking it are telling you that you liked it for the wrong reasons." t. Plague circa 2015
[3:48:27] <+HawkGoggles2> Remember that first anime you watched and you were aware of it. Remember how much you liked it. FF7 is that for a lot of people.
[3:48:28] <fluffy_sauce> its like when Peter Jackson decided to take the Hobbit, which is a 300 page book, and make it into a trilogy of 3hour long movies
[3:48:40] <+BurkeBigsby> Played FF7 first time last year. Still a good game. Story is and writing is very jank. I think people hoped this would fix the that.
[3:48:52] <Ralfclogs> ugh the hobbit...
[3:48:52] <CursedNobleman> @fluffy_sauce needs more tom bombadil
[3:49:17] <arkv01> roche is the japanese biker gang archetype
[3:49:28] <+Mashuukitty> whos he talking bout?
[3:49:31] <SupportWriter> @BurkeBigsby If that was the case, lol
[3:49:33] <Sol_Install> the first thing people say about Roche is "omg Dante!"
[3:49:33] <Kampler21> inb4 roche is a party member in the future parts
[3:49:34] <SupportWriter> MaxLOL
[3:49:44] <+fizzguy47> Roche Exotic
[3:49:54] <Sol_Install> Watch later part add New soldiers like Roach
[3:49:55] <Zinax7> i thought he would be more agile in his fight
[3:49:57] <GeltonZ> I love really really dumb characters so I like Roche.
[3:50:00] <Zinax7> but he was suprisingly slow
[3:50:02] <+aspirationdeath> @cursednobleman it hurts all games. fidelity on consoles is what led to all these "cinematic" games. they are so focused on using all types of smoke and mirrors to hide the limitations of tech that game design comes second
[3:50:18] <KaiserMario> @HawkGoggles2 Back when it came out, there wasn't anything like it, so there's that aspect to it. The game is still good by today's standards, just not as good as some people (like Max) would have you believe...
[3:50:19] <CursedNobleman> who cares about roche, just give me 5 minutes of jessie humping my-i mean clouds back
[3:50:22] <GiygasDrillBreak> SquareEnix is just bad at making video games
[3:50:27] <+BurkeBigsby> @supportwriter People gonna suck the dick of this game from nostalgia is fine with me. I don't gotta play it
[3:50:29] <+machinetoys> who's roche
[3:50:33] <%bettysharkface> So essentially the thing that made this game so valuable in the past no longer has any novelty.
[3:50:34] <BurdRightsActivist> consoles bad gimme upvote
[3:50:40] <Zinax7> I'm just worried
[3:50:51] <Zinax7> that focusing too much on more ff7 remakes
[3:51:02] <Zinax7> they won't make ff16 or any other new ips
[3:51:09] <cerazor01> Roche was probably gonna come back in the Siege of Midgar
[3:51:10] <arkv01> the novelty is actually this juicy use of UE4
[3:51:12] <+TeethMuncher> Bike Boner
[3:51:13] <CursedNobleman> @aspirationdeath like, you need a team to do something that 1 or 2 guys used to do in the snes days. or rpgs are more constrained than platformers and it becomes a series of room fights without any differentiating encounters
[3:51:18] <SupportWriter> @BurkeBigsby Don't get me wrong, I think the same way.
[3:51:18] <Hydrapissed> awww yeh big bike FUCK
[3:51:19] <+lojack69> I don't want FF16 after seeing what FF15 was
[3:51:19] <mrjplays2k9> roche is only there because you see zero other soldiers in the game
[3:51:19] <+HawkGoggles2> @KaiserMario I mean nothing like FF7 in terms of presentation and only in video games.
[3:51:25] <Zinax7> hey
[3:51:32] <%Megabulldog> brokern
[3:51:37] <Gavaline> @zina Honestly, after 13, 15, and the Remake, do you really WANT a 16?
[3:51:38] <GiygasDrillBreak> japanese production methods for video games do not scale well to 21st century technology and market sensibilities, Square Enix is the definition of this
[3:51:42] <Zinax7> maximillian super anime dood likes roche
[3:51:42] <CursedNobleman> not that old timey battles were particularily interesting
[3:51:46] <arkv01> makes me wonder if we'll still fight 3C soldiers ah shinra HQ
[3:51:59] <+Mashuukitty> yes
[3:51:59] <+zombieghost1337> Nope
[3:52:02] <+fizzguy47> he looks like anime Joe Exotic
[3:52:02] <Commissar_Cornflakes> RE4 does not need a fucking remake.
[3:52:03] <Zinax7> @Gavaline well not really actually, I have little faith tbh
[3:52:05] <TheWe4pon> oh. oh god
[3:52:05] <+TeethMuncher> It was expected
[3:52:07] <arkv01> yeah that was kinda not great
[3:52:08] <TheWe4pon> plz no
[3:52:09] <+ArmoredTeeth> I'm extremely concerned
[3:52:10] <Hydrapissed> awww yeh they are
[3:52:14] <GeltonZ> EVERYONE has said "Please don't"
[3:52:15] <Hydrapissed> WHENS god hand 2
[3:52:17] <AxelCezar> oh boy that RE3 multyplayer...
[3:52:17] <Zinax7> but i wanna see how they screw themselves even further
[3:52:21] <Gavaline> They already have the groundwork - the Nemesis zombies are just plagas
[3:52:30] <CursedNobleman> i beat RE4 for the first time in the last 5 months. still an amazing game
[3:52:39] <+TeethMuncher> Cowards need to make Dragon's Dogma 2
[3:52:42] <arkv01> yeah I also have a huge hankering to play the original ff7 right now
[3:52:47] <+ArmoredTeeth> Just watch them remove the suplex in RE4 REmake
[3:52:49] <+BurkeBigsby> Honestly, I'm sick of them making characters swear, and trying to appeal to western gamma males.
[3:52:50] <Hydrapissed> dogma 2 yah and god hand 2
[3:52:51] <Hydrapissed> lets o0o0o0o0 it
[3:52:58] <+thefakeh> are the few things tifas tits and aerith being qt
[3:53:04] <+zombieghost1337> dogma 2 never ever :(
[3:53:05] <Zinax7> it's more linear cuz of the pretty "setpieces"
[3:53:07] <MilkingEdge> remake code veronica
[3:53:09] <Hydrapissed> capcom gana burn
[3:53:10] <KaiserMario> This will sell on brand recognition alone...
[3:53:13] <arkv01> the sale for this game are going to absolutely fill squenixs coffers
[3:53:13] <tolloponik> it's like Miyazaki's studio announcing that they are remaking howls moving castle
[3:53:19] <Sol_Install> Turn on Capcom.... Again
[3:53:21] <Zinax7> btw has anyone heard
[3:53:24] <Zinax7> re 4 remake
[3:53:25] <Zinax7> 2022
[3:53:27] <+TeethMuncher> It'll be fine if they re-release the chainsaw controller
[3:53:28] <CursedNobleman> Miyazaki: remakes were a mistake
[3:53:31] <notanegg8> remaking re4 is a project that should take a lot more care than it's gonna get
[3:53:32] <+StreamStopA> I don't think that 4 needs a remake yet.
[3:53:37] <+ArmoredTeeth> Probably going to replace Ashley's skirt with pants too lol
[3:53:41] <Gavaline> Crazy idea - can we just have new things and self contained stories?
[3:53:42] <GeltonZ> @Zinax7 LITERALLY what we were just talking about
[3:53:58] <arkv01> like if they want a B team to do remakes, remake the revelatons
[3:54:01] <GiygasDrillBreak> Capcom CAN make video games, RE3make was actually rushed. it wasn't fundamentally dysfunctional. if it had another 8 months of beta development, there would be very little criticism to levy on it
[3:54:02] <+aspirationdeath> there is nothing they could do to improve it while preserving it that would be anything more than an engine/graphical upgrade
[3:54:09] <Zinax7> @GeltonZ i was focusing more on the year that it's planned to come out
[3:54:11] <+FrenchTact1cs> glad the gripes are relatively minor
[3:54:15] <Sol_Install> @Gavaline Wat!? that sounds like waste of money! We need those rose glasses money!
[3:54:17] <GeltonZ> @Zinax7 Ah
[3:54:22] <Zinax7> which is a year after re 8
[3:54:26] <notanegg8> @Gavaline no but that might not sell though. we gotta cash in on stuff that's already been proven to sell. we gotta
[3:54:27] <+ArmoredTeeth> Worse yet, watch them remove the Merchant for being too campy
[3:54:29] <Zinax7> supposedly
[3:54:30] <CursedNobleman> RE4 is great, especially big dumb action hero leon! LUL
[3:54:32] <KaiserMario> I honestly think RE4 Remake has great pontential, and I'm not too skeptic about it. Capcom knows how important RE4 is, they'd likely give the same treatment 2 had at least
[3:54:50] <arkv01> I would have more fun escorting ashley as a moving boulder, yes
[3:54:52] <Zinax7> replacing ashley with sherry (who was originally be the girl)
[3:54:57] <+Jumpie8> that would make the game easier
[3:54:59] <+ArmoredTeeth> Jokes on you, I'm into that shit
[3:55:05] <london_flexing> Did anyone actually think the original plot was good? Both seem like high school writing imo
[3:55:08] <+HawkGoggles2> It's messed up because if we use 3 Remake as a base the game play would be the only thing to take a hit.
[3:55:20] <Kampler21> How about they remake Megaman Legends instead
[3:55:44] <CursedNobleman> @london_flexing the plot was stupid but leons dialogue is so cheesy its great
[3:55:44] <+Jumpie8> they should just make RE8 already
[3:55:46] <oshkeet41> yeah it fels more like a handwave to not worry if you miss buying one or two weapons
[3:55:53] <+TeethMuncher> They flattened the cruve
[3:56:00] <arkv01> RE8 is due next year
[3:56:02] <GiygasDrillBreak> Megaman was Inafune's baby. Capcom hates Inafune so much they will never dignify Megaman with a high budget game
[3:56:05] <arkv01> according to rumours
[3:56:14] <CursedNobleman> and its a game about zombies, i dont need a goddamn plot
[3:56:26] <KaiserMario> Matt was complaining about RE4 getting a remake over something else like Code Veronica, Dino Crisis, or Onimusha, but he forgets, those DON'T SELL! At least not like RE4 does...
[3:56:45] <london_flexing> I was talking about final fantasy plots, but yea same kinda goes for that series as well
[3:56:46] <GiygasDrillBreak> Code Veronica did sell well, though
[3:56:48] <CursedNobleman> LUL Onimusha DansGame
[3:56:50] <arkv01> I mean is capcom that hungry for money? All their RE engine games + monster hunter are doing gangbusters
[3:57:13] <KaiserMario> @GiygasDrillBreak Not like RE4
[3:57:29] <KaiserMario> Also Code Veronica sucks ass
[3:57:30] <+BurkeBigsby> Why wouldn't Capcom plan ahead and capitalize on hype, no matter the money they're making?
[3:57:41] <CrowbarFacelift> Tbh I'm way more interested in Code:Veronica with the current engine over RE4
[3:57:43] <CursedNobleman> i wonder how trials of mana will be
[3:57:45] <tolloponik> their DLC's were terrible though
[3:57:57] <Zinax7> heck i would even take an re3 remake length of code veronica
[3:58:07] <+HawkGoggles2> Well it seems like RE 3 remake was lead by RedWorks and 4 is going off completely to M-Two so there's something there.
[3:58:10] <GiygasDrillBreak> CV predated RE4, so of course it wouldn't do as well as RE4, but CV did turn heads that Dead Aim did not
[3:58:17] <london_flexing> @arkv01 I mean they're a business, so strike while the iron is hard, right?
[3:58:32] <Zinax7> who's m-twos?
[3:58:42] <arkv01> @london_flexing at the risk of inflaming fans who have been screaming RE4 IS FINE
[3:58:45] <KaiserMario> Dead Aim is a pathetic flop, and it's terrible, of course it sold worse than CVX
[3:59:09] <GiygasDrillBreak> they wont remake Dead Aim because nobody knows what Dead Aim is
[3:59:23] <+HawkGoggles2> @Zinax7 M-Two was a developer that helped make RE 3 Remake.
[3:59:32] <+BurkeBigsby> Capcom gotta get on VR remakes for Umrella Chronicles atpRtsd
[3:59:41] <CursedNobleman> resident evil outbreak remake without voice chat LUL
[3:59:42] <GiygasDrillBreak> it's a catch-22 industry: you need a household brand name to sell, but you can't make a new household brand name
[3:59:43] <Zinax7> hmm action wise they should be fine
[3:59:50] <Zinax7> but content wise i dunno
[4:00:08] <+FrenchTact1cs> its worth leveling
[4:00:26] <+TeethMuncher> They're shy
[4:00:47] <CursedNobleman> seeing the materia slots is so pretty
[4:00:53] <arkv01> yeah I think they might unlock grind mode after we're past a certain point in the story
[4:00:58] <arkv01> for now they want to railroad us at a good pace
[4:01:06] <KaiserMario> All things considered, CVX would benefit the most by getting a remake, because is the one that is terrible, but can still be fixed. Dead Aim is just a lost cause...
[4:01:08] <london_flexing> @arkv01 You're right, but they're probably more concerned with lining up projects for future revenue
[4:01:08] <+fizzguy47> levelling also contributes to weapon upgrades
[4:01:11] <Kampler21> What other final fantasy game would you like to see remade @PlagueOfGripes
[4:01:23] <CursedNobleman> SIX. SIX. SIX. and tactics.
[4:01:28] <CursedNobleman> And Tactics advance.
[4:01:34] <+lojack69> Don't fucking TOUCH tactics
[4:01:36] <metalwater8> yo holograms are expensive
[4:01:42] <Hydrapissed> 8 so I can LAFF
[4:01:47] <CursedNobleman> 9 is nice too
[4:01:51] <Zinax7> yep 8
[4:01:52] <CursedNobleman> LUL
[4:01:55] <arkv01> cloud why'd you pull that fucking lever! Now we have to punish you and flatten that dick
[4:01:56] <Sol_Install> damn
[4:02:01] <CursedNobleman> 8 is a pile of shit. I love it LUL
[4:02:03] <GiygasDrillBreak> they made a mobile garbage tactics. FF8 deserves a remake
[4:02:04] <+HawkGoggles2> What about a one for one remaster.
[4:02:07] <Zinax7> i wanna just walk in hd balamb garden
[4:02:09] <+TeethMuncher> The improvement to 12 made that game so much better
[4:02:09] <notanegg8> tactics with the visual style of octopath
[4:02:17] <BurdRightsActivist> woah HOLY SHIT GUYS DID YOU SEE THE MATERIA IS ACTUALLY slotted in Cloud's WEAPONNNNNNN
[4:02:18] <fatalDestiny> I think a remake of 8 in this style would kinda work, it's already so linear,
[4:02:27] <GiygasDrillBreak> FF9 could use one too but it originally sold like half as much as FF8 did
[4:02:27] <arkv01> 8 is a pile of shit but it's my pile of shit sugoiPunpun2
[4:02:47] <Zinax7> ff8 remake It's ONLY A DREAM BRO
[4:02:51] <CursedNobleman> i think 8s biggest weakness is that everyone knows the best way to play it is to not fight
[4:02:59] <%CyberDingus> >Have Tifa work the pump
[4:03:01] <%CyberDingus> giggity
[4:03:20] <TheWe4pon> remake 11
[4:03:31] <+justianxix> like wind waker
[4:03:40] <+TeethMuncher> They put in a fast forward button in 12 so it wasn't as painful
[4:04:08] <CursedNobleman> remake old PS1 tactics with the OG translation
[4:04:10] <arkv01> work that pump like I'm the pump, girl
[4:04:15] <sosandstorm> this seems tedious
[4:04:18] <terminusterminal> These are the weirdest controls for a timing game I've ever seen
[4:04:21] <Zinax7> @PlagueOfGripes don't u wish there are gambit system for the buddy ai?
[4:04:22] <Hydrapissed> yahhhh tifa
[4:04:22] <CursedNobleman> I just want a VA to say. Liiiittttleeeee Moooooneeeeey
[4:04:22] <KaiserMario> The thing with 12, is that a big aspect to the gameplay is setting up your gambits, so you can just watch it work, instead of mashing "X" on combats. But a lot of people don't consider that gameplay, so there's that
[4:04:27] <Hydrapissed> ima stare
[4:04:34] <terminusterminal> You gotta get it in the red area
[4:04:37] <BurdRightsActivist> MMMM PUMP ME TIFA

[4:06:24] <Hydrapissed> HAHAHAHAHAHA
[4:06:26] <+TeethMuncher> Quality padding
[4:06:26] <SuperVaderMan> at least the red zone keeps getting bigger
[4:06:27] <examplez0> FF7 had too many shitty minigames
[4:06:28] <Hydrapissed> AHHAHAhaha
[4:06:29] <Zinax7> LOL
[4:06:30] <Sol_Install> HAHAHAHA
[4:06:31] <BurdRightsActivist> KEEP PUMPINNN
[4:06:32] <Tunykun> crawling in my skinnnnnnnn
[4:06:34] <AngryHorn> OMEGALUL
[4:06:34] <MartiusGW> thank you nomura!
[4:06:36] <examplez0> So Square Enix corrected this by adding even more
[4:06:37] <+Mashuukitty> only pressure increase is you rblood pressure
[4:06:39] <Futurecity10> WAKE ME UP
[4:06:39] <Hydrapissed> LOL
[4:06:40] <kuzokai> having fun
[4:06:43] <Commissar_Cornflakes> Tifa's about ready to clock her on the head
[4:06:44] <arkv01> I tells yo uwhat plague I ain't DONE with the pumping
[4:06:44] <NWannabe> huhuhu
[4:06:45] <Hydrapissed> this game rules actually
[4:06:46] <CrowbarFacelift> LUL
[4:06:48] <slimbreadsticks> lmao
[4:06:53] <+StreamStopA> it did
[4:06:54] <metalwater8> we knnow you just want to see tifa keep pumping plague its alright
[4:07:03] <CursedNobleman> this game doesnt even make sense. pumps dont work like that
[4:07:04] <Zinax7> keep KALm
[4:07:05] <sosandstorm> Alright Definitive addition right here
[4:07:08] <kuzokai> the play through ender
[4:07:09] <CrowbarFacelift> They have to leave that bit of white at the very end just to be a shit
[4:07:09] <Gavaline> And they purposely keep it from filling out the bottom so you still can fail with a "maxed" bar
[4:07:09] <silverpoyozo> F. U. N.
[4:07:11] <cerazor01> its your internal rythmn thats getting it wrong
[4:07:14] <NWannabe> i like how the bottom part of the meter won't fill in no matter what
[4:07:17] <+TeethMuncher> Is speed dependent on mashing?
[4:07:26] <Sol_Install> it was ok then it sank fast
[4:07:27] <KaiserMario> @TeethMuncher That depends on what you consider a RPG... I mean, "Role-playing" barely applies to any game we call RPGs...
[4:07:31] <Hydrapissed> hes gna throw the controller soon
[4:07:33] <Tunykun> The ultimate gatekeeping. Not fighting, but timing minigames.
[4:07:40] <arkv01> woops! Guess you'll have to breathe harder tifa
[4:07:41] <sosandstorm> fuck the back of my neck hurts from laughing god damn it
[4:07:43] <NWannabe> i see 3 more tries
[4:07:44] <agadejobi> I spent like 30 minutes studying the word anathema
[4:08:02] <TheWe4pon> padding the minigame
[4:08:02] <sosandstorm> if we type "now" into chat will that help?
[4:08:04] <+TeethMuncher> Aerith, please...
[4:08:05] <AxelCezar> holy shit
[4:08:05] <terminusterminal> Is this the end of FF7 Remake?
[4:08:07] <%JailShmixRemix> This is pretty dumb
[4:08:18] <slimbreadsticks> prey slaughtered
[4:08:19] <Gavaline> I mean, thanks for letting me hear Tifa's grunts from working the pump each time I guess?

[4:12:40] <agadejobi> No more pasta, pizza, anything with wheat
[4:12:41] <+HawkGoggles2> Every just throw last night's broccoli into your ramen. Pretty good.
[4:12:42] <+Mashuukitty> gurlpower

[4:13:33] <+kenuran> Ninja Kappas
[4:13:34] <ThatGuyThere03> they're just low level mobs
[4:13:42] <+HawkGoggles2> How many time do we have to beat up the ninja teenagers.
[4:13:48] <Gavaline> If the time ghosts make the girls have a 'special' kind of friendship, would you forgive Nomura?
[4:13:51] <+StreamStopA> One of my roommates went out and bought hundreds of ramen packets because of covid-19 like a retard.
[4:13:54] <CursedNobleman> how i never thought id miss the halcyon era of 3d models on rendered screens
[4:13:58] <MilkingEdge> DISCOUNT NINJA TURTLE
[4:14:02] <arkv01> only if nomura replaces cloud in episode 2
[4:14:05] <+fizzguy47> these fucking frog bastards
[4:14:14] <+Mashuukitty> lol
[4:14:25] <%CyberDingus> Kiss the princess frog!
[4:14:27] <arkv01> you have to smooch aeris now
[4:14:28] <Zinax7> chibi cloud
[4:14:30] <+TeethMuncher> Do people into frogs count as scalies?
[4:14:36] <Zinax7> funko pop
[4:14:38] <+fizzguy47> an improvement, really
[4:14:38] <Sol_Install> mini would probably be there polygon from the og
[4:14:39] <Gavaline> Please tell me they brought back the frog loop
[4:14:40] <Bardofkeys> @plagueofgripes it would just be a old spirte call back most likely
[4:14:41] <cerazor01> Use the original FF7 models
[4:14:43] <CursedNobleman> @TeethMuncher no?
[4:14:43] <+HawkGoggles2> It's just the PS1 models.
[4:14:45] <cerazor01> as the chibi forms
[4:14:47] <MilkingEdge> MINI ME
[4:14:48] <oshkeet41> you can still attack and magic with mini tho, a chibi model would be too much work
[4:14:49] <AxelCezar> no no, the miny should bring the old chiby forms
[4:14:52] <seth45er> the old PS1` models
[4:14:55] <oshkeet41> shitty ps1 models for mini would be hilarious
[4:15:03] <Zinax7> where do they get their spears from?
[4:15:05] <CursedNobleman> that also goes for dolphin or shark-anthros
[4:15:05] <+TeethMuncher> @CursedNobleman what do you call them then?
[4:15:35] <CursedNobleman> creepy sex perverts? LUL

[4:15:52] <CursedNobleman> its not my fault theyre degenerates instead of monstergirl chads
[4:15:55] <+FrenchTact1cs> she hits too hard to even combo most times
[4:16:05] <MilkingEdge> Kappa
[4:16:11] <$jamarartdoodles> Good dps
[4:16:13] <ThatGuyThere03> twitch icons?
[4:16:15] <ThatGuyThere03> for what?
[4:16:19] <+Mashuukitty> i know an artist
[4:16:20] <%JailShmixRemix> Subs
[4:16:31] <CursedNobleman> NWF emote!
[4:16:32] <+StreamStopA> I have MS paint!
[4:16:34] <KaiserMario> To be fair, Plague isn't properly taking advantage of weaknesess, using magic and filling that staggered bar, so the combat is not optimal, therefore, annoying...
[4:16:40] <sosandstorm> Alright I'm back, that Z pump was a bitch eh?
[4:16:43] <asshunter1536> discord emotes are way easier to make
[4:16:54] <+lojack69> of the 4 streams I have watched of FF& remake now, not one of them ever bothered to try blocking attacks
[4:17:09] <+lojack69> FF7 remake*
[4:17:10] <Zinax7> this is basically a bit of xenoblade
[4:17:17] <agadejobi> These ninja turtle rip offs are kicking your ass
[4:17:18] <Zinax7> where you have to topple the enemy
[4:17:19] <arkv01> these fishfuckers are horny for human females
[4:17:20] <+StreamStopA> @sosandstorm it took way too long
[4:17:43] <sosandstorm> @StreamStopA That last light was hilarious though
[4:18:00] <Gavaline> Wait, show frog model
[4:18:07] <+broth_elemental> My main grip with the game is that the later you get into it, the more enemies just seem to hone in on whoever you're currently controlling and stunlock you.
[4:18:10] <Gavaline> Does it have Tifa's skirt/shorts?
[4:18:20] <xrolenks> got to block like crazy
[4:18:21] <$jamarartdoodles> skirt
[4:18:32] <+fizzguy47> it's different for every character
[4:18:33] <+lojack69> It's almost like you are not using a third of your available options
[4:18:37] <xrolenks> nah dude heal first
[4:18:38] <Hydrapissed> 5 head CAT
[4:18:39] <Gavaline> Neat
[4:18:46] <MilkingEdge> NUGGIES
[4:18:53] <agadejobi> I like Carbunkle more when it's more like a lizard
[4:18:58] <Bardofkeys> Did they turn carbuncle into a pomeranian?
[4:19:16] <Tzefiro> Pomeranian with a head tumor
[4:19:18] <%CyberDingus> raise Cloud?
[4:19:34] <sosandstorm> I don't know if I like what they did to Red XIII in this one
[4:19:47] <CursedNobleman> this carbuncle design DansGame
[4:20:00] <Bardofkeys> OHHHHH I remember these things now. They were a weird enemy type in crisis core that spammed jump. They were annoying then and are still annoying now.
[4:20:13] <+lojack69> He wants to fight training dummies every combat as opposed to enemies apparently
[4:20:33] <Sol_Install> no joy
[4:20:41] <KaiserMario> Yeah, I get the complaint that the game wants you to fight enemies in specific ways, so it doesn't let you experiment a whole lot, but it's more like Plague refuses to engage with some combat options
[4:20:43] <Sol_Install> only pain with these frogs
[4:20:51] <TonberryLives> Why do you need joy Plague?
[4:20:51] <arkv01> at least the frog status was cute
[4:21:00] <+lojack69> I cant listen to this, later Eli
[4:21:06] <+lojack69> sticking around will teach me to hate you
[4:21:08] <+lojack69> see ya
[4:21:11] <terminusterminal> waaaa
[4:21:33] <arkv01> why all these sewer boys got longass tongues
[4:21:33] <Bardofkeys> I beg to differ
[4:21:36] <arkv01> what they lickin
[4:21:38] <Bardofkeys> -Fishman
[4:21:45] <agadejobi> Where does Aeris keep her staff? Its it like a Nyoibō?
[4:22:20] <+Audega> How are you enjoying the game so far?
[4:22:22] <+macdaddy531566> HAHAHAHA! Honeymooners! Definitely going to use that in the future.
[4:22:27] <Hydrapissed> or magic staff idk
[4:22:30] <CursedNobleman> thats the general logic for monster encounters i guess
[4:22:41] <+HawkGoggles2> Shit is about to go down.
[4:22:52] <MilkingEdge> They have a black hole under their skirt
[4:22:55] <arkv01> yeah minutes after aps
[4:22:59] <arkv01> big stretcho
[4:23:02] <CursedNobleman> im gonna watch a ff7 speedrun sometime LUL
[4:23:24] <sosandstorm> "got it memorized?"
[4:23:25] <CursedNobleman> bof4 too as well i suppose
[4:23:33] <london_flexing> lol how many installations will they make of this remake? LUL LUL
[4:23:36] <+sund0wner> 7 hours, 34 minutes, 46 seconds
[4:23:37] <arkv01> 8-9 hours?
[4:23:37] <cerazor01> thats a very Advent Children Reno
[4:23:38] <Bardofkeys> I never understood the turks. Like are they just the "Its just my job" sort of dude or are they borderline sociopaths?
[4:23:44] <BillieNoMates> Its their job
[4:23:53] <BillieNoMates> Rude pretty much shows it that way
[4:23:54] <%CyberDingus> They never asked for this
[4:23:57] <agadejobi> Fun fact: Rude has a crush on Tifa
[4:23:57] <BillieNoMates> Reno is an asshole tho
[4:24:00] <%CyberDingus> but $20 is $20!
[4:24:04] <+sund0wner> OH?!
[4:24:08] <+sund0wner> Sheeeeeit
[4:24:08] <dmdyne99> Is Reno a joker copy yet?
[4:24:10] <BillieNoMates> I imagine the longest part if Midgar
[4:24:16] <+BKNPham> plagueChirei
[4:24:25] <Bardofkeys> But they all act like they have a conscience. Oh fuck is this just the "Nobodies don't have emotions" thing?
[4:24:26] <Gavaline> @PlagueOfGripes lojack's issue seemed to be that you weren't utilizing combat options and mechanics which made the sahagin encounter more difficult, not out of blind remake defense
[4:24:28] <arkv01> no, midgars like 1.5 hours IIRC
[4:24:29] <%JailShmixRemix> plagueImoya
[4:25:15] <cerazor01> Lojack does have a point
[4:25:26] <Bardofkeys> Like they look cool but I can't help but remember a lot of the stuff about the turks is kinds dumb
[4:25:31] <MilkingEdge> backseat driver
[4:25:36] <%JailShmixRemix> His point is that he should play the game himself
[4:25:39] <Sol_Install> yea
[4:25:45] <Gavaline> Time ghosts pls
[4:25:50] <KaiserMario> It's funny that I thought they'd stretch the length in iconic sections and kinda slack on other things, but it's more of the other way around... the iconic bits you do it in one spurt, but the in-betweens are just way too long...
[4:25:54] <oshkeet41> boo ghosties~
[4:26:03] <arkv01> haunted mansion experience with two girlfriends, lucky femdicker!
[4:26:05] <Sol_Install> Boo! I need a hug!
[4:26:12] <CursedNobleman> hows scary lessons coming aalong anyhow?
[4:26:16] <MilkingEdge> spooky scary ghost
[4:26:27] <Bardofkeys> @arkv01 I...learned a new word today.
[4:26:28] <dmdyne99> Graveyards are haunted? Say it ain’t so!
[4:26:28] <+HawkGoggles2> This game makes it out that this is the place people go to spoke pot.
[4:26:33] <Sol_Install> that rat went flying
[4:26:45] <TonberryLives> Those rats were very threatening
[4:26:57] <arkv01> screw fighting the canon boss in this graveyard, give us the phantom train
[4:27:04] <Huntercd> Isn't spooky shit Vincent's deal?
[4:27:10] <Hydrapissed> yep
[4:27:22] <Huntercd> So why is this here?
[4:27:24] <dmdyne99> Phantom trains or weretrains, like in futurama
[4:27:24] <Bardofkeys> My old home town had a coal train graveyard. Was fun to play hide and seek in but MAN did the old methed out guy across the street hate us there
[4:27:37] <Hydrapissed> wonder if hard mode helps that
[4:27:43] <Hydrapissed> the bosses are prob hella long then
[4:27:48] <arkv01> the vibe of the train graveyard was a lot more comfy cause of the BGM they play during this sequence
[4:27:59] <Sol_Install> LASER BEAM
[4:28:08] <Hydrapissed> wow more damge on staggerd to
[4:28:12] <Hydrapissed> bet that shits
[4:28:32] <CursedNobleman> This is ancient Earth's most foolish videogame. Why does Tifa, the largest friend, not simply suplex the trains out of the way?
[4:28:48] <arkv01> not feeling the new bgm they use here
[4:29:19] <Hydrapissed> monkaS
[4:29:24] <CursedNobleman> i remember running around the first screen for 40 minutes trying to find eligor
[4:29:27] <arkv01> whuh, time ghosts?
[4:29:27] <cerazor01> HELL HOUSE
[4:29:28] <ScreamLord> @PlagueOfGripes Are trains even widely used anymore?
[4:29:32] <+HawkGoggles2> Oh no the spooks.
[4:29:33] <+TeethMuncher> Where my ghosts at?
[4:29:34] <+fizzguy47> it was a giant metal plate built 300 ft in the air?
[4:29:39] <TonberryLives> No you WILL confront the door
[4:29:44] <Hydrapissed> Clouds scared plague
[4:29:46] <dmdyne99> Still plenty of train companies still running
[4:29:51] <ScreamLord> The game says no
[4:29:56] <Shemegory> grug no care about door, grug want smash box
[4:30:11] <arkv01> yeah this is my second biggest beef with this game so far, forced camera focus and movement restriction
[4:30:39] <arkv01> we doing grudge vs sadako?
[4:30:51] <oshkeet41> Aeris you hear the literaly PLANET, you hearing a kid as a weird voice seems LESS scary to me.
[4:31:26] <arkv01> fatal frame this is not LUL
[4:31:27] <dmdyne99> Little kid = little pothead
[4:31:44] <ScreamLord> @PlagueOfGripes Hopefully FF7-R Part 2 will be less handholdy and more open.
[4:31:45] <arkv01> great train interiors though
[4:31:50] <Bardofkeys> Yeah it kinda avoids the body horror doesn't it since most experiments are monster truck monsters and silly cyber mutants
[4:31:58] <CursedNobleman> ELI-GOR
[4:32:04] <+HawkGoggles2> Who set these fires.
[4:32:05] <+fizzguy47> A lot of BNGs in this place
[4:32:14] <Gavaline> I mean, the background setting of FF7 is just Who Goes There?
[4:32:36] <dmdyne99> No hellhouse yet?
[4:32:41] <arkv01> LUl
[4:32:47] <TheWe4pon> missed hellhouse
[4:32:49] <arkv01> thatssome pokemon ass ghosts
[4:32:59] <TheWe4pon> that was hours(?) ago now
[4:32:59] <slimbreadsticks> hellhouse
[4:33:00] <CursedNobleman> did eli hate hellhouse?
[4:33:23] <SuperVaderMan> he liked the concept and it looked funny, but the fight sucked ass
[4:33:25] <ScreamLord> Eli was annoyed by Hellhouse
[4:33:27] <arkv01> hellhouse was mechanically a pain in the ass to fight
[4:33:38] <@Nightbot> Plague is a youtube animator and also streams at https://picarto.tv/Plague . Also: t-shirts! http://goo.gl/lze8QO
[4:33:45] <cerazor01> Gimme more Hellhouse
[4:33:47] <arkv01> Wowee this ghost graffiti
[4:34:04] <CursedNobleman> reasonable. as long as you didnt dislike it conceptually LUL
[4:34:28] <arkv01> lotta time to refine for episode 2, which I think is going to be a much better time given the more open world elements we'll be seeing
[4:34:34] <CursedNobleman> i wonder how the weirdo post-sephiroth enemies look
[4:34:39] <CursedNobleman> in shinra tower
[4:35:02] <shutupyouprick> stringent eh?
[4:35:04] <Bardofkeys> Is it just me or did lot of rpgs of the area all have a scrap yard area around the same time mark?
[4:35:05] <ScreamLord> Whirlwind something
[4:35:14] <slimbreadsticks> her starshower skill is good
[4:35:15] <Bardofkeys> era*
[4:35:21] <CursedNobleman> what other rpgs are you thinking of?
[4:35:39] <CursedNobleman> i only remember scrapyards in like fallout
[4:35:42] <Bardofkeys> Chrono trigger, A few of the others rpgs like legends of dragoon
[4:35:59] <CursedNobleman> chrono trigger is fair, ive not played dragoon
[4:36:00] <+HeWhoControlsTheSalt> looking sexy today Plague
[4:36:04] <Bardofkeys> breath of fire has what amounts to a scrap yard filled with poison gas
[4:36:09] <Sol_Install> they'll be fine
[4:36:14] <CursedNobleman> @Bardofkeys true.
[4:36:18] <Bardofkeys> all like the 2nd or 3rd area always.
[4:36:21] <slimbreadsticks> remember golden sun or was that a fever dream
[4:36:21] <arkv01> oh no they plate is falling NOW, gg
[4:36:22] <ScreamLord> @cerazor01 That sword looks like more of a boat oar than even the Buster Sword
[4:36:24] <+axenred> how does it feel knowing you are a slightly more handsome Pat?
[4:36:28] <dmdyne99> A whole big segment of Chrono Trigger is basically a scrapyard
[4:36:28] <TonberryLives> Right I forgot that's what we're doing LUL
[4:36:33] <ScreamLord> @PlagueOfGripes That sword looks like more of a boat oar than even the Buster Sword
[4:36:52] <arkv01> no, I want her to suplex ghosts
[4:36:54] <+TeethMuncher> Fists shouldn't work on ghosts though
[4:36:58] <SupportWriter> That or literally constantly hearing the cries of the planet
[4:37:00] <Sol_Install> yea
[4:37:00] <+wwarden82> Gotta be afraid of something
[4:37:06] <+StreamStopA> come on what?
[4:37:10] <+BurkeBigsby> Yes because japan trope.
[4:37:21] <arkv01> c...cum?
[4:37:26] <Bardofkeys> The music does not mix with any of this too well.
[4:37:28] <+OneGorillionDollars> clouds reaction here is actually appropriate "seriously"
[4:37:35] <%CyberDingus> @PlagueOfGripes read all the messages :V
[4:37:36] <MilkingEdge> Ghost: NORMIES GET OUT
[4:37:46] <+axenred> in reality, children generally scream instead
[4:37:58] <+TeethMuncher> Are the child ghosts working with the time ghosts?
[4:37:59] <dmdyne99> Never back down from ghosts
[4:37:59] <Shemegory> gasp gasp gasp
[4:37:59] <Gavaline> The ghosts just write down a link to THAT Tifa video
[4:38:07] <BurdRightsActivist> GET OFF MY DICK SEAN BEAN HOLY FUCK
[4:38:09] <arkv01> this isn't ghost graffiti anymore, someone just bukkaked these walls and there's a blacklight shining on everything
[4:38:11] <FockHead> What the fuck is happening
[4:38:12] <terminusterminal> Cloud is also afraid of ghosts?
[4:38:17] <+BurkeBigsby> atpSolid atpDog
[4:38:20] <Bardofkeys> Holy fuck the sexual energy
[4:38:22] <+OneGorillionDollars> HAREM
[4:38:23] <CursedNobleman> chad pose LUL
[4:38:24] <ScreamLord> And then they fucked
[4:38:30] <arkv01> cloud strife, the anti puss
[4:38:38] <TonberryLives> Hmm
[4:38:46] <Gavaline> Shhhhh
[4:38:46] <Sol_Install> It's FINE
[4:38:50] <FockHead> That and you guys fight monsters for a living why be afraid of ghosts??
[4:38:53] <dmdyne99> Enter the ghost bukake cave Cloud!
[4:38:54] <+StreamStopA> look up and take a scren shot
[4:38:57] <Bardofkeys> @arkv01 Every japanese protag "Ewwww girls are iky"
[4:38:59] <Sol_Install> your 100% right BUT IT'S FINE
[4:39:00] <slimbreadsticks> wedges ass can only fit so many bullets
[4:39:09] <MilkingEdge> ewww cooties
[4:39:10] <CursedNobleman> less ghosting more eiffel towering
[4:39:13] <examplez0> They've completely destroyed the pacing here
[4:39:13] <+zombieghost1337> nah aint no time for that plague, these girls are thirsty NOW
[4:39:15] <+Critical_Shotglass> PLAGUE, KISS ME
[4:39:16] <+TeethMuncher> But we need this arm candy moment
[4:39:19] <+illoonar> but fanseeeeeeervise
[4:39:26] <TwinBat> let go thots
[4:39:30] <+zombieghost1337> LOL
[4:39:31] <arkv01> most japanese jrpg protags are just dense, cloud is actively repulsing all attempts to guide his dick
[4:39:33] <%JailShmixRemix> Does this game even have an open world moment?
[4:39:55] <Bardofkeys> "Dick attack" hits the ear super wrong.
[4:39:55] <+OneGorillionDollars> "get These thots off me"
[4:40:07] <+HawkGoggles2> The sky sperm? Yeah, that's normal.
[4:40:07] <+zombieghost1337> these girls acting like teenage boys lol
[4:40:11] <ScreamLord> @PlagueOfGripes I think they were too afraid of the rabid fanbase to make it less linear
[4:40:12] <arkv01> my gut screams boss room
[4:40:15] <MilkingEdge> Use your hardedge cloud
[4:40:20] <Zinax7> BEYOND TWO SOULS
[4:40:20] <Gavaline> Yeah, but at this point, Cloud is still "Cloud"
[4:40:20] <$jamarartdoodles> Draw dickbutts on the wall
[4:40:21] <+StreamStopA> it protecc but mostly spit coom from scacc
[4:40:21] <arkv01> WOW REALLY
[4:40:23] <oshkeet41> passive protag is to make it easier to selinsert or something
[4:40:24] <FockHead> How long until they bring in lame stuff like Geostigma
[4:40:36] <+TeethMuncher> That's just a new school digimon
[4:40:38] <CursedNobleman> good redesign
[4:40:38] <+HeWhoControlsTheSalt> are these heartless?
[4:40:40] <arkv01> ghost BULLI
[4:40:41] <Daxalog> Is that an actual Heartless symbol on the back?
[4:40:44] <+HawkGoggles2> I forgot Aerith talks to ghosts.
[4:40:49] <deltakyurem> just a question did you already get Shiva
[4:40:51] <Shemegory> kill the children to save the children plague
[4:40:58] <MilkingEdge> plot ghost vs ghost
[4:41:03] <Gavaline> Cast heal spells on them?
[4:41:04] <arkv01> order 66 these ghosts
[4:41:22] <%caramello_man> @deltakyurem yeah he got shiva and the fat chocobo
[4:41:26] <Bardofkeys> @milkingedge Can the death note script kill a ghost?"
[4:41:34] <dmdyne99> Fist that ghost!
[4:41:38] <+OneGorillionDollars> tifa should really not be afraid of ghosts after the first time she realizes she is able to punch them
[4:42:09] <+TeethMuncher> That's just an urn
[4:42:16] <arkv01> then kill its entire ghost family
[4:42:19] <ScreamLord> I never got into FF12. I should check out the Zodiac edition
[4:42:21] <$jamarartdoodles> lol
[4:42:23] <arkv01> no ghost survivors allowed
[4:42:37] <arkv01> this is one of the good ones huh
[4:43:01] <Gavaline> Do time ghosts and regular ghosts have turf wars?
[4:43:06] <arkv01> PHANTOM TRAIN PogChamp
[4:43:07] <CursedNobleman> In FF7, train suplexs you!
[4:43:08] <+OneGorillionDollars> these are average everyday ghosts
[4:43:11] <TheWe4pon> ghost on ghost violence
[4:43:19] <arkv01> oh it was just a projectile :(
[4:43:26] <Bardofkeys> Dude sinister has some DUMB time ghosts
[4:43:34] <MilkingEdge> ghetto ghost vs time ghost
[4:43:38] <deltakyurem> i tried to solo shiva with cloud. worst decision of my life. However Aerith made it a cake walk @caramello_man
[4:43:44] <+Punishedkaiger> Damnit plague
[4:43:45] <Shemegory> cause 50% of the retcons?
[4:43:45] <CursedNobleman> cmonBruh
[4:43:45] <ScreamLord> LUL
[4:43:46] <ahaegotrigger> LUL
[4:43:47] <terminusterminal> I like statistics too
[4:43:51] <%CyberDingus> 13\52
[4:43:55] <+StreamStopA> cause 52% of all the spooks
[4:43:56] <Yuroshi> atpBigot
[4:43:56] <+TeethMuncher> Systematic racism against ghosts, huh?
[4:43:57] <%CyberDingus> damn ghosters
[4:44:09] <arkv01> yeah that is petty mean, clodd
[4:44:11] <+OneGorillionDollars> the ghost war starts now!
[4:44:13] <Bardofkeys> @streamstopa Jeeeeesus christ
[4:44:36] <ScreamLord> They prefer to be called Spectral Individuals
[4:44:38] <+fizzguy47> gotta keep the time ghosts separate from the other ghosts
[4:45:01] <MilkingEdge> Call the sector 7 ghostbusters
[4:45:14] <+OneGorillionDollars> them dirty al bhed ghosts. amirite eh?
[4:45:17] <%caramello_man> @deltakyurem yeah you kinda need a dedicated mage for that fight
[4:45:20] <Gavaline> For anyone that's played/playing this: do heal spells still damage undead enemies like the ghosts?
[4:45:25] <+TeethMuncher> You better get haunted by the ghosts of Shinra soldiers
[4:45:28] <+Nepycros> Ya ever have one of those days where you wake up, look in the mirror, and realize that you would make a great Bibleman villain?
[4:45:37] <arkv01> whoaaaa
[4:45:39] <arkv01> spook
[4:45:59] <xeros720> i cast raise and killed one, you don't get exp or ap for it though
[4:46:06] <+TeethMuncher> @Nepycros no, but I'm intrigued
[4:46:09] <Mythundare> ghost train PogChamp
[4:46:12] <Hydrapissed> monkaS
[4:46:13] <slimbreadsticks> no its ghosts
[4:46:19] <Sol_Install> magic move the crane
[4:46:26] <Gavaline> @xeros720 Good to know - thanks!
[4:46:30] <+ATorL> ghost train
[4:46:30] <+TeethMuncher> So are the ghosts helping or not?
[4:46:34] <+StreamStopA> Ghost lives matter
[4:46:41] <Sol_Install> so cute
[4:46:43] <+HeWhoControlsTheSalt> ghost cum
[4:46:47] <MilkingEdge> tien ghost
[4:46:52] <Mythundare> ectoplasm
[4:46:57] <Sol_Install> doesn't cure or raise do anything to them btw?
[4:46:57] <Bardofkeys> I would describe the amount of splatter as "Unhealthy"
[4:46:58] <examplez0> So it looks like we've just completely forgotten that everyone in sector 7 is about to die
[4:47:02] <slimbreadsticks> blue lives dont matter tho ayy
[4:47:05] <+illoonar> LUL
[4:47:14] <+OneGorillionDollars> remake 6 for the purpose of seeing a train get suplexed in HD
[4:47:38] <+LordSDB> Ghosts want more ghost pals
[4:47:38] <+TeethMuncher> Just a prank, bro
[4:47:52] <CursedNobleman> lame how they remade 4 for DS but not 6
[4:48:03] <CursedNobleman> hell, they remade 3 for the DS LUL
[4:48:08] <deltakyurem> assess it
[4:48:39] <ScreamLord> So what's the fastest way to build of the Limit bar? It seems random too me
[4:48:46] <Gavaline> Can't wait for the eventual 4 After Years remake. Just pour salt on the ashes.
[4:48:57] <hectoriglesiasbenavides> GOOD MORNING
[4:48:59] <examplez0> It builds when you take damage
[4:49:06] <examplez0> Same as the original
[4:49:06] <hectoriglesiasbenavides> sorry mayus
[4:49:09] <KaiserMario> I wonder if Plague doesn't want to use magic ever because he wants to save MP, or because it breaks the pacing of combat? Either way, he's having way more trouble than he should for never using it...
[4:49:11] <xeros720> yeah, player dmg
[4:49:38] <xeros720> it's kind of silly how much bar you get if you have to spam heals
[4:50:02] <examplez0> He's not using most of his abilities either
[4:50:11] <CursedNobleman> its always hard to mentally tell yourself to use magic because mp is an annoying resource to manage
[4:50:51] <+TeethMuncher> What is a Final Fantasy if not it's cut scenes?
[4:50:51] <examplez0> It wouldn't be so bad if this sidequest wasn't right in the middle of something far more urgent
[4:51:06] <KaiserMario> @CursedNobleman I agree, but in original FF7, you'd use more often because of turn based combat
[4:51:10] <examplez0> And just keeps going on and on and on and on
[4:51:17] <+StreamStopA> Like some kind of hallway adventure.
[4:51:39] <CursedNobleman> @KaiserMario you didnt really need magic in the OG. the monsters and encounters in this one are pretty sturdy
[4:51:39] <examplez0> Next person to bitch about original FF7's pacing and linearity can go fuck a cactus
[4:51:45] <arkv01> this is some FFX ass battle music
[4:52:21] <CursedNobleman> @examplez0 i get to pick the cactus
[4:52:37] <%caramello_man> @examplez0 cactuar?
[4:52:43] <examplez0> ^
[4:52:46] <CursedNobleman> google cactus girl LUL
[4:52:57] <KaiserMario> @CursedNobleman If you wanted to get further in on a lower level using magic properly helps a lot
[4:52:59] <examplez0> Just wait a week until everyone finishes the game
[4:53:08] <examplez0> Because that ending, holy fuck...
[4:53:19] <fatalDestiny> It really feels like a game people will play once, and if they want to replay they'll still go back to the original/
[4:53:25] <cyberblueneon> this is like watching a shounen anime where the characters are in the middle of fighting a serious threat, then in the middle of that theres a filler arc where they have to go fetch a cat from a tree or something
[4:53:32] <xeros720> this game really does have a lot ff15 dna in it
[4:53:42] <examplez0> And a beach episode in the middle of that
[4:54:01] <+TeethMuncher> A Plague can dream
[4:54:06] <+fizzguy47> @xeros720 And FFXIII
[4:54:19] <+LordSDB> I've mostly seen people be more critical of this game than praising it plague
[4:54:23] <seth45er> should of had the structure of yakuza city map
[4:54:32] <TheWe4pon> Was old FF7 Square or Squenix?
[4:54:33] <CursedNobleman> in retrospect, i really appreciated how the older FFs give you a few screens, maybe a boss, then shuttered you to a completely different setting
[4:54:37] <CursedNobleman> Square
[4:54:42] <KaiserMario> There's more 13 in this than 15, at least in 15 you could openly explore for most of the game
[4:54:47] <CursedNobleman> Squeenix wasnt until 2003ish
[4:54:55] <Sol_Install> god
[4:55:04] <xeros720> well 15 had really two open areas
[4:55:05] <Sol_Install> BOTW was so fucking boring
[4:55:09] <examplez0> @fatalDestiny if there's one good thing that'll come out of the remake is that it'll make people appreciate the original more
[4:55:13] <examplez0> For better or worse
[4:55:13] <ScreamLord> @PlagueOfGripes Does the Original open up a tone after Midgar tho? They'll piss a lot of people off if they shrink it down too much
[4:55:23] <ScreamLord> *Doesn't
[4:55:24] <Futurecity10> I fucking hated Breath of the wild and I beat it twice and 100%ed it once
[4:55:28] <examplez0> I own Breath of the Wild but haven't played it
[4:55:33] <+TeethMuncher> That's Sekiro for me
[4:55:38] <examplez0> It's next on my backlog
[4:55:40] <CursedNobleman> climbing was a pain. but otherwise i liked BOTW
[4:55:52] <%caramello_man> yep i'm in the middle of my first playthrough of botw and it's getting kinda shit
[4:56:08] <KaiserMario> @xeros720 Yeah, but they were huge and were half the game, and the most fun was in those parts. The worst parts of 15 were the hallways
[4:56:26] <CursedNobleman> that place made no sense LUL
[4:56:29] <NWannabe> So you'd say these kinda games are fun to discover, moreso than play.
[4:56:31] <examplez0> That minigame was shit
[4:56:45] <CursedNobleman> @examplez0 go fucka cactus LUL
[4:56:53] <xeros720> that's due to the dungeon type areas being few and having low area and enemy variety
[4:57:00] <examplez0> I just stood there and let the enemy reach the summit
[4:57:11] <examplez0> Then fought them
[4:57:18] <xeros720> i do like how they give you a good amount of variety in this
[4:57:42] <examplez0> not even that
[4:57:43] <SupportWriter> @xeros720 Variety in what way
[4:57:51] <scribbledguy> @PlagueOfGripes are you making a video on this?
[4:58:01] <xeros720> enemy types, bosses, and locales
[4:58:02] <KaiserMario> This is better than both 13 and 15, but when comparing the three of them, there's way more in common with 13
[4:58:13] <examplez0> You take two steps forward then if you try to go back an invisible wall appears then your party tells you to go the other way
[4:58:14] <CursedNobleman> not if he wants FF fans to open up a second asshole LUL
[4:58:15] <SupportWriter> Not compared to the og
[4:58:20] <+stephentoostronk> there are places you can't go till you get Gold Chocobo
[4:58:20] <arkv01> can't lose to the ghost dick, tifa says
[4:59:04] <Gavaline> Haven't had any blatant Sephiroth scenes in quite a little while.
[4:59:04] <CursedNobleman> i wonder if im being a douchey console fanboy since i dont have a ps4
[4:59:07] <cerazor01> they will
[4:59:13] <cerazor01> you'd be suprised
[4:59:17] <cerazor01> it is a Quartintine
[4:59:18] <TonberryLives> We are LUL
[4:59:19] <CursedNobleman> its not like i can actually play this
[4:59:19] <ahaegotrigger> they did it for Dark souls
[4:59:19] <scribbledguy> @PlagueOfGripes lol no, like a gripe video
[4:59:21] <cerazor01> Quarantine
[4:59:21] <Sol_Install> you say that then people do it
[4:59:24] <SupportWriter> Well, cursed
[4:59:28] <Futurecity10> I've sat here for 20 hours listening to you mutter about FF7
[4:59:29] <SupportWriter> you just need to wait what
[4:59:31] <SupportWriter> A year?
[4:59:37] <+EpicureanIguana> wth is up with that sword, looks so awful
[4:59:38] <CursedNobleman> switch cant handle this
[4:59:40] <Sol_Install> oh shit that piano is going in
[4:59:46] <SupportWriter> Is that the exclusive deal
[5:00:01] <SupportWriter> After that it goes on PC
[5:00:02] <Hydrapissed> full BLOWN nomura
[5:00:03] <examplez0> Savor this Plague
[5:00:09] <CursedNobleman> and i dont really play modern RPGs... atelier series aside
[5:00:10] <examplez0> Because it does get stupid real fast
[5:00:11] <TonberryLives> Oh god does it NotLikeThis
[5:00:13] <+thebeststand> does the healing stuuf work on undead still/
[5:00:14] <+HawkGoggles2> Oh when whenever you run int Jenova.
[5:00:15] <xeros720> the spirit shit you mean?
[5:00:15] <kiwicoffin> They really stick it in your face that this isn't your dad's FF7
[5:00:18] <Hydrapissed> Death stranding x a biliion
[5:00:20] <+TeethMuncher> Regardless of how opinions of this game turns out, we'll always have Hip Hop Chocobo
[5:00:27] <examplez0> Savor the lack of Sephiroth shoved down your throat
[5:00:29] <TheWe4pon> dont spoiler, i wanna rage live
[5:00:29] <CursedNobleman> @TeethMuncher LUL
[5:00:41] <arkv01> for all the new players, sephiroth might as well be cloud's ex
[5:00:47] <vincerocmm> years a go
[5:00:57] <ScreamLord> @PlagueOfGripes I feel sorry for Sephiroth. He used to be such an interesting character but now he's just a generic cartoon villain
[5:01:01] <+LordSDB> Didn't cloud say he killed him during his first freak out in this game?
[5:01:03] <+EpicureanIguana> It has Nomura's fingerpints all over, even if he isnt in the credits there is no way in hell he didnt take part
[5:01:06] <Gavaline> Actually, does this game's Bahamut use the FF7 model or something closer to X's since AC reused X's to make Bahamut SIN?
[5:01:14] <examplez0> I don't think Sephiroth even knew who Cloud was in the original game
[5:01:37] <Gavaline> 4.0 never ever
[5:01:42] <+HawkGoggles2> he already did that with the movie, he didn't need to do it again.
[5:01:42] <arkv01> anno split his soul into a million time ghosts
[5:01:48] <%caramello_man> plague can you just talk like that from now on
[5:01:51] <+arancet> i kinda like the concept, but better when its subtle, not TIME GHOSTS
[5:01:57] <CursedNobleman> if i had artistic talent id do an E-THAT plagueface LUL
[5:02:01] <CursedNobleman> E-Thot*
[5:02:02] <MilkingEdge> shut it nomura
[5:02:11] <ScreamLord> Was Nomura even involve in the OG FF7?
[5:02:18] <SupportWriter> TBF, Anno had to support GAINAX after their huge fuck up and that most likely impacted Rebuild
[5:02:18] <cerazor01> <.<
[5:02:28] <GiygasDrillBreak> Nomura was a writer and character artist for FF7 OG
[5:02:44] <+rytyoung> ghoooooooost
[5:02:48] <examplez0> Not a writer
[5:02:50] <kiwicoffin> Reminds me of Kojima twisting his own themes to respond to fans
[5:03:03] <Hydrapissed> doll face
[5:03:12] <examplez0> Kojima's credibility as a writer went out the window after MGS4
[5:03:31] <arkv01> gon gitchu
[5:03:31] <oshkeet41> Thing is, if they were like 'real' ghosts you could make a great metaphor for Tifa being scared of things she cant just punch.
[5:03:32] <MilkingEdge> gonna getacha
[5:03:39] <GiygasDrillBreak> Writer(s) Kazushige Nojima Tetsuya Nomura Hironobu Sakaguchi Yoshinori Kitase
[5:03:40] <cerazor01> I think in FF Dissidia Nomura said that the reason Sephiroth always loses despite being able to create Supernova's. Is that he kinda doesn't want to win.
[5:03:41] <oshkeet41> Foreshadowing for all her emotional stuff.
[5:03:43] <CursedNobleman> i dunno, memes were a decent writing theme for the modern era
[5:03:43] <TonberryLives> Neat
[5:03:45] <raminnoodle420> YEAAAA
[5:03:48] <+HawkGoggles2> it's just a big dumb FF ghost.
[5:03:48] <arkv01> ok thats horrifying
[5:03:51] <Hydrapissed> ghost ORGY
[5:03:52] <Hydrapissed> awww yeh
[5:03:54] <cerazor01> I DONT HAVE TIME FOR YOU SHIT
[5:03:54] <+TeethMuncher> Big ass ghosts with no ass
[5:03:58] <CursedNobleman> we did elect a meme president after all
[5:04:00] <oshkeet41> ectoplasm everywhere
[5:04:20] <ScreamLord> @PlagueOfGripes Tifa can punch the ghosts. WHy is she scared of them?
[5:04:35] <arkv01> probably same way we can squash bugs but its icky
[5:04:49] <xeros720> if you want to dodge stuff, you really want the parry materia, lot more iframes
[5:04:53] <+fizzguy47> collision is a bitch
[5:04:58] <KaiserMario> @examplez0 You say that, as we are now living in quarentined shelters...
[5:05:37] <Gavaline> @SupportWriter Fair point, but keep in mind his involvement in MEMEME. More than a bit hypocritical to criticize neets and otakus while simultaneously making things concurrently with your criticizing project that milk them for money. Makes it harder to defend the rebuilds and his decisions.
[5:05:56] <examplez0> @KaiserMario Haven't played Death Stranding
[5:06:06] <kuzokai> think scan might say anything useful?
[5:06:07] <examplez0> Probably never will
[5:06:48] <KaiserMario> @examplez0 Not saying you should, but you just made a bold claim there and it wasn't totally fair
[5:07:11] <MESeele> How far into the game is he?
[5:07:18] <SupportWriter> https://www.imdb.com/title/tt5493898/fullcredits?ref_=ttco_sa_1 @Gavaline What part of Memememe did Anno do?
[5:07:21] <xeros720> he changes color plague
[5:07:37] <CursedNobleman> how were combat mechanics in KH?
[5:07:49] <examplez0> @KaiserMario Kojima was a better writer back when he had Fukushima as a co-writer
[5:07:52] <StromkoPenguin> Being debilitated looks so fun Kappa
[5:08:04] <+broth_elemental> Everything casually poisons you
[5:08:11] <cerazor01> HE'S BLACK
[5:08:16] <oshkeet41> IDK about FF but doesnt like , uh, heals hurt undead in rpgs sometimes
[5:08:20] <CursedNobleman> cmonBruh
[5:08:21] <MilkingEdge> Black ghost
[5:08:23] <oshkeet41> Enix games anyway
[5:08:32] <+TeethMuncher> Just spoiled myself on the ending and boy is body ready
[5:08:57] <mapimb> !uptime
[5:08:57] <@Nightbot> 5 hours 9 minutes 6 seconds
[5:09:10] <MESeele> Just got here and there's already a lot of face palming going on
[5:09:12] <+rytyoung> @teethmuncher ohhhhh boy
[5:09:58] <KaiserMario> @examplez0 Kojima was always a director, he always co-wrote his games because of this, so when he's writing alone it suffers. His ideas and concepts, however, are always good, even if other aspects aren't, he always delivers a interenting vision
[5:10:06] <oshkeet41> one thing im noticing about the bosses. eh i dunno, i feel like in the old game even if you didnt do the boss 'right', you could still kinda brute it until late into the game. This one seems to punish you p hard if you try that
[5:10:38] <metalwater8> Blue hit with physical and red with magic?
[5:10:38] <Shemegory> cmonBruh
[5:10:44] <CursedNobleman> in the OG youd just save limit breaks then blitz the boss LUL
[5:10:44] <valriot> Can you use revives to Insta kill it?
[5:11:03] <deltakyurem> I know how it works now
[5:11:04] <cerazor01> Throw Phoenix Downs at it like Dog Treats?
[5:11:14] <+BKNPham> plagueImoya
[5:11:14] <%JailShmixRemix> I think immune states to an entire archetype is pretty dumb in any game
[5:11:16] <+rytyoung> @oshkeet41 Not really, spells and abilities still do lots of damage, and if you keep on top of your party's health pool you can survive in battles without knowing the optimal strat
[5:11:34] <oshkeet41> cure sometimes works but idk, depending on the game they wont even let you target enemies with it
[5:11:49] <oshkeet41> i havent played an ff in ages
[5:11:57] <xeros720> if anything, they really expect you to scan bosses
[5:12:11] <CursedNobleman> i kinda wanna replay FFT myself
[5:12:39] <+rytyoung> @plagueofgripes bit of a hint, I would have steal ready for the end of this chapter
[5:12:55] <arkv01> what, we STILL have eligor to fight?
[5:13:14] <kuzokai> apparently he is weak to fire
[5:13:15] <+rytyoung> @arkv01 at the end of this ch I'm sure
[5:13:21] <arkv01> wow, two bosses huh
[5:13:23] <mapimb> shouldn't the boss warn you if hes about to change immunities
[5:13:30] <@Nightbot> Plague is a youtube animator and also streams at https://picarto.tv/Plague . Also: t-shirts! http://goo.gl/lze8QO
[5:13:40] <deltakyurem> It goes between a physical and see through state. physical can is when he seems solid and only physical attacks work. when its see through unload you spells
[5:13:44] <oshkeet41> this game really does like its physics engine for projectiles
[5:13:54] <+rytyoung> @plagueofgripes I won't go into much more for spoiler sake, but I missed out on a weapon because I didn't have steal equipped
[5:14:09] <raminnoodle420> do it, Cure him
[5:14:48] <+rytyoung> don't repeat this fools mistakes psaLiz
[5:15:19] <TheWe4pon> can you even target hostiles with cure?
[5:15:50] <+rytyoung> yup, certain enemies are weak to it depending on the state they're in
[5:16:02] <+rytyoung> probably only one enemy
[5:16:36] <gnollAUS> The fire made it open up
[5:16:56] <+stephane3012> ghost enemies are so annoying
[5:17:09] <raminnoodle420> who knows?
[5:17:12] <+rytyoung> The power is on now
[5:17:33] <+HawkGoggles2> I hope Aerith has time to play with all of the sector 7 ghosts like this after all of the time we wasted.
[5:18:01] <MESeele> tentacles Tifa, if it caught you, the answer is always tentacles
[5:18:03] <Gavaline> @SupportWriter MeMeMe came out of the animator expo KharaxDwango hosted. Anno was the Planning (Executive Producer) role as well as the (Tor)-kun character designer. Apologies for the delay, it took me a minute to check given the current state of the original site.
[5:18:04] <arkv01> thats a question for another game aeris
[5:18:12] <deltakyurem> the fight was only this hard because you caught on to the boss mechanics slowly
[5:18:51] <oshkeet41> spaaace balls
[5:19:08] <%JailShmixRemix> lol
[5:19:20] <SupportWriter> Yes, and all he did was approve the ideas to go forward. That whole thing was a test of sorts for Studio Khara for them to expand their skills and such
[5:19:26] <arkv01> turn me into a vampire aeris
[5:19:28] <+rytyoung> Attack/magic attack all the waaay
[5:19:30] <mapimb> YOU WERE SUPPOSED TO DO IT PROPERLY
[5:19:38] <Maids4lyfe> LUL
[5:19:41] <+rytyoung> and materia slots are nice
[5:19:46] <arkv01> WHY AREN'T YOU AT WORLD RECORD PACE, NO DINNER TONIGHT
[5:19:47] <Hydrapissed> comfyOMEGAREE
[5:19:56] <SupportWriter> Since it was similar to what he did in College when he was starting out as an animator
[5:20:20] <+rytyoung> It'd be nice to switch w
[5:20:30] <+rytyoung> Weapons in that menu
[5:20:30] <deltakyurem> no thats not what i meant. i mean that the boss would switch from see through to solid. but hey this is your first run so we all make mistakes. your not stupid, just learning
[5:20:36] <SupportWriter> Anno had no major part in MEMEME'S production, only just approving the initial idea.
[5:20:37] <arkv01> steal for eligor probably
[5:20:42] <terminusterminal> Just have steal prepped for eligor
[5:20:46] <arkv01> same as OG
[5:20:49] <terminusterminal> Or whoever is at the end of this
[5:20:50] <+rytyoung> ^^^
[5:21:34] <+rytyoung> Ya
[5:22:09] <+rytyoung> I beat this game over 8 days everything's a hazy memory to me now
[5:22:15] <MESeele> or % to steal on hit
[5:22:28] <xeros720> probably do steal with a linked ability or materia
[5:22:37] <arkv01> steal with luck up?
[5:22:39] <Gavaline> Yeah, it was to emulate the Daicon animations, nor did I say he did the lion's share of anything. However, his roles at all in it, given it's blatant message, strike hollow given the business model of Eva and especially the development of 3.0 with its changes.
[5:23:16] <+rytyoung> Luck improves steal chances, but after using it enough times it'll work
[5:23:19] <scribbledguy> @PlagueOfGripes The Drake is there to drop its new single waka waka
[5:24:00] <arkv01> it'd be a nice easter egg if tifa was benching the bench as you're recovering on it
[5:24:46] <SupportWriter> Like I said, all he did was approve the initial idea and allowed the students and participants to expand on their own ideas. If he had done otherwise, it would hamper with the idea of the project. Just cause he was Executive Producer for the whole event doesn't mean every short had his personal touch to it,
[5:24:56] <oshkeet41> yeah, its like added effect but worse
[5:25:00] <+rytyoung> So reduces debuffs times to linked materia
[5:25:24] <xeros720> useful for one or two bosses i imagine
[5:25:59] <+rytyoung> If you know the moves that enemies use like stop it can help, but only slightly
[5:26:51] <examplez0> At least there are no random encounters
[5:27:03] <CursedNobleman> ice-cold
[5:27:22] <+rytyoung> random spawning mobs would slow the game down so much
[5:27:42] <MESeele> can you jump out of battle?
[5:27:43] <xeros720> they will respawn if you backtrack though
[5:28:00] <+rytyoung> @meseele you can flee if you run away from the fight
[5:28:01] <NWannabe> how many final fantasies have NG+?
[5:28:27] <MESeele> no I mean can you jump when just exploring the environment?
[5:28:42] <+rytyoung> 15 added it in an update
[5:29:03] <xeros720> maybe 13 2 and 3
[5:29:10] <examplez0> The game's already slowed down enough without them
[5:29:20] <arkv01> boy 14 could use an NG+ in this unreal engine 4 juice
[5:29:22] <MESeele> can you randomly bunny-hop down a hallway, or are you groundbound when not in a fight
[5:29:31] <+LordSDB> 12 did for the zodiac age, and 13 lighting returns
[5:29:42] <Zinax7> wait plague is still in the graveyard?
[5:30:17] <arkv01> graveyards been stretched
[5:30:27] <xeros720> the graveyard is a lot bigger now for sure
[5:30:28] <GeltonZ> @MESeele I think I remember being ground bound in this game.
[5:30:30] <+rytyoung> @meseele sadly no jumping, I used to hate a game if I couldn't jump in it for some reason
[5:30:38] <NWannabe> how could an MMO use NG+?
[5:30:49] <MESeele> ah, thanks for the answers
[5:31:09] <Huntercd> I have been listening to Eli for too long, he has rubbed off on me
[5:31:16] <MESeele> jumping isn't needed, but it adds something somehow
[5:31:37] <+rytyoung> Ive not used breach much
[5:31:53] <%caramello_man> this game has invisible walls all over so there's no need for a jump really
[5:32:00] <CursedNobleman> jumping looks so kingdom heartsy
[5:32:25] <MESeele> so still linear till the overworld huh
[5:32:30] <arkv01> jumping would be hard to implement in this since you can control aerith, she definutely can't do soldier super jumps
[5:32:51] <TheWe4pon> force turn-based combat
[5:33:01] <+rytyoung> It would be nice to have a bit of aerial control for combat as some enemies that are in the air aren't reachable as Cloud or Tifa, even though they do have aerial attacks
[5:33:03] <MESeele> @arkv01 that is a fair point
[5:33:05] <arkv01> thats what classic mode was expected to be, but oh well
[5:33:14] <arkv01> WHOA WHAT
[5:33:38] <@Nightbot> Plague is a youtube animator and also streams at https://picarto.tv/Plague . Also: t-shirts! http://goo.gl/lze8QO
[5:33:41] <+rytyoung> SHES SO CUTE
[5:33:51] <MESeele> the daughter needs a gun arm
[5:33:52] <arkv01> dwaddy BibleThump
[5:33:59] <+rytyoung> @meseele LUL
[5:34:06] <%JailShmixRemix> Tifa why :(
[5:34:24] <seth45er> the bombing the reactor
[5:34:25] <arkv01> this is emotional manipulation man, not cool nomura
[5:34:26] <MilkingEdge> BARRET: MARLENEEEE
[5:34:27] <oshkeet41> Jeez now that i have a niece, little kid stuff like this hits me harder than it really should :\
[5:34:40] <+HawkGoggles2> When the ghost tell you to hurry the fuck up.
[5:34:47] <terminusterminal> Sephiroth stabs Marlene.
[5:34:48] <MESeele> 4 gun limbs?
[5:34:48] <CantButtle> y is living daughter become ghost?
[5:34:56] <xeros720> secret boss: marlene
[5:35:01] <arkv01> 5, her mouth shoots grenades
[5:35:04] <%caramello_man> in this version aeris holds up marlene to die
[5:35:14] <CantButtle> oh
[5:35:14] <+rytyoung> In FF 7-2: Marlene's Saga
[5:35:15] <oshkeet41> Honestly Seph would do that just to fuck with Clloud
[5:35:27] <examplez0> Haha oh no you aren't done with them by a long shot
[5:35:37] <examplez0> That's an understatement
[5:35:49] <arkv01> goddamit fuck these BNGs
[5:36:01] <SuperVaderMan> Rats pissed that you're moving their bridge
[5:36:02] <+rytyoung> "How do we turn a 5 hour portion of an RPG into a full release?"
[5:36:02] <examplez0> The ROUSes
[5:36:08] <arkv01> this was like a 5 minute segment in the original
[5:36:24] <CantButtle> ghost rat
[5:36:26] <GeltonZ> Non-Plot Ghosts
[5:36:29] <oshkeet41> I remember some anime trope that said Japanese people were encouraged to play rpgs only one or two hours at a time and that a lot of devs still design around that
[5:36:35] <CantButtle> all ghosts were once rats
[5:36:37] <MilkingEdge> GBHOST RATS
[5:36:38] <Kampler21> This section feels like it lasts forever lol
[5:36:42] <raminnoodle420> GHOST RATS!
[5:36:44] <oshkeet41> hence repeating plot points and weird pacing if you go thru something in one go.
[5:36:48] <Kampler21> literally dragging
[5:36:48] <xeros720> the ghost rat alliance is a proud and honored lineage
[5:36:55] <+rytyoung> @oshkeet41 I played P5 like that somewhat
[5:36:59] <SupportWriter> Scaven
[5:37:11] <raminnoodle420> Generations have sworn on the ghost rat aliiance
[5:37:14] <oshkeet41> fairness, Persona has a literal time/day system so i can give that a pass
[5:37:36] <MESeele> I'm playing royal right now and the cat is somehow even more annoying
[5:37:49] <%JailShmixRemix> Jizzzzzzz more jizz
[5:38:04] <+stephane3012> you are so right
[5:38:11] <TalisKanju> That was true in the original though, also
[5:38:11] <arkv01> nomura grabs your dick and asks "fun? you rike fun? no fun sorry"
[5:38:15] <+rytyoung> True, after so many days roll by I lose motivation to keep grinding, I will get royal at some point , but I only beat p5 last year
[5:38:29] <@dcn2049> The game does seem designed entirely around knowing who you're playing as and what you're trying to do, like an input reading slut
[5:38:56] <%JailShmixRemix> Is it a dirty input reading slut?
[5:38:59] <MilkingEdge> sloppy nomura handjobs
[5:39:03] <MESeele> Can't I just buy this soda before doing what you want cat!? It's right there! I'm touching it! C'mon!!
[5:39:08] <+aspirationdeath> forgive the game for thinking youd like to engage the mechanics to gain a tactical advantage. theres always easy
[5:39:17] <+MrWrann> God I'm annoyed by the invulnerability and I'm not even playing
[5:39:19] <+aspirationdeath> :) :)
[5:39:20] <+stephane3012> they always go into cutscenes after spending 5 mins trying to stagger them
[5:39:42] <%JailShmixRemix> Immune states aren't engaging
[5:39:44] <$Rivalshotzgp> But then the pro’s can win easier!
[5:40:02] <xeros720> chihuahua with bling
[5:40:21] <MESeele> I like that Tifa has that shoulder check from gantz (also probably something else)
[5:40:29] <+rytyoung> What annoys me the most about this game is casting a spell, only to be knocked out of casting it, wasting MP and ATB gagye
[5:40:32] <+rytyoung> gague
[5:40:36] <gnollAUS> Bullet hell
[5:40:39] <MESeele> probably kamen rider or something
[5:40:40] <cerazor01> no
[5:41:06] <KaiserMario> @PlagueOfGripes Using healing items is faster, magic has casting time
[5:41:18] <arkv01> cmon game just let us go drop some plates
[5:41:20] <MilkingEdge> filler episodes
[5:41:27] <oshkeet41> meat sponges
[5:41:35] <CantButtle> like an insecure ladies bra
[5:41:39] <Futurecity10> plague, you want to know how many chapters are left?
[5:41:47] <MESeele> Automata shits on this battle system?
[5:41:48] <arkv01> just SUPER jump, aeris is dead weight
[5:41:52] <CantButtle> padded lies
[5:42:19] <arkv01> POWERED BY TIME GHOSTS
[5:42:21] <+rytyoung> No train tracks? We don't need train tracks...
[5:42:24] <examplez0> 18 chapters in total
[5:42:28] <SuperVaderMan> thanks train ghosts
[5:42:45] <CantButtle> how many rat ghosts did that take to power?
[5:42:50] <+aspirationdeath> @jailshmixremix it halts momentum for sure. still, he seems to just want to mash to win. and thats somehow fun to him in a ff game
[5:42:53] <$Rivalshotzgp> Why leave a working train? Wouldn’t the poor people be able to use it?
[5:42:56] <MESeele> gotta balance on ropes and climb a wall
[5:43:05] <arkv01> reno having second reservations about dropping the plate compared to the original
[5:43:29] <examplez0> That happens after Aerith is kidnapped
[5:43:38] <examplez0> In both the original and the remake
[5:43:51] <Gavaline> @SupportWriter He objectively did more than just approve the initial idea, as indicated directly in the credits - he designed Tor-kun. At the very least, he had *some* personal touch to the short beyond an oversight EP role. I doubt he did much more precisely for the reasons you said, but he definitively had a role in the short. He has been rightfully critical of blind escapism, and yet directly appeals to/profits from escapism via non original Eva/EoE, which seems hypocritical to me.
[5:43:56] <+rytyoung> Keep on keepin' on YOU FOOLS
[5:44:02] <%CyberDingus> @PlagueOfGripes MELODRAMA
[5:44:11] <%CyberDingus> angst for the angst gods!
[5:44:14] <Yuroshi> we don't have time to move
[5:44:21] <Yuroshi> we have to talk about needing to move
[5:44:27] <oshkeet41> The weird thing Cloud is enough of an ass still he'd rag on the two for taking up so much time
[5:44:28] <arkv01> this would really not be a good time for a boss battle, we gotta go stop terrorism???
[5:44:32] <oshkeet41> like itd be totally in character
[5:44:34] <MESeele> *sigh* after that Prozd clip I always notice the absurd head bobbing while talking
[5:44:37] <xeros720> dragons give no fucks
[5:44:37] <TheWe4pon> !uptime
[5:44:38] <SupportWriter> Tor-Kun was the mascot who appeared in the beginning before the shorts began
[5:44:38] <@Nightbot> 5 hours 44 minutes 47 seconds
[5:44:38] <arkv01> *inside job
[5:44:38] <examplez0> They spend more time talking about moving forward than actually moving forward
[5:44:38] <Sol_Install> big blind
[5:44:40] <%caramello_man> walking AND talking! impossible!
[5:45:33] <MESeele> Japanese game acting... like bobble heads
[5:46:02] <+StreamStopA> The game sucks you in all the wrong ways
[5:46:05] <+rytyoung> Screw flying a chopper under the plates, what if the rotor hits the top?!
[5:46:13] <examplez0> https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xIANCyXGN5I
[5:46:24] <CantButtle> how
[5:46:37] <CantButtle> how do they have power??
[5:46:37] <MESeele> lol
[5:46:45] <gnollAUS> A ten foot pole?
[5:46:45] <MESeele> step ladder of power
[5:46:47] <suitangi021> you mean death strandiung
[5:46:48] <+HawkGoggles2> Animal Crossing has one of those.
[5:46:49] <SuperVaderMan> carry around a ladder like in animal crossing :)
[5:46:50] <metalwater8> magic
[5:46:51] <+rytyoung> That's an animal crossing patented idea LUL
[5:46:52] <CantButtle> r they using materia?
[5:46:55] <IminyourBase> why would you carry around a heavy ass ladder?
[5:46:55] <Sol_Install> oh man
[5:47:02] <$Rivalshotzgp> Cloud can jump that high though
[5:47:03] <Ynkubus18> ladders op plz nerf
[5:47:04] <MilkingEdge> ghost tech
[5:47:06] <examplez0> Why can't Cloud just do an anime jump like in Advent Children?
[5:47:09] <$Rivalshotzgp> He doesn’t even need a ladder
[5:47:11] <Sol_Install> that would be fun if someone did DS but in a smaller scope
[5:47:11] <oshkeet41> Man even just materia used in a 'realistic' way could let you do neat stuff
[5:47:17] <oshkeet41> thats more like a D&D game tho
[5:47:17] <IminyourBase> the man is swinging around a 300 pound sword and you want him to carry a ladder too?
[5:47:22] <Sol_Install> still like DS
[5:47:32] <+Solid_Stro> Sam Bridges, the most capable of protagonists
[5:47:36] <oshkeet41> tie rope to sword. throw sword over ledge. climb rope.
[5:47:37] <cerazor01> funni how Cloud could easily jump onto and over these trains
[5:47:43] <+rytyoung> @iminyourbase Sam Bridges could carry more LUL
[5:47:46] <suitangi021> 2 of these characters could back flip over the train
[5:47:59] <MESeele> gameplay and... gameplay segregation
[5:48:24] <%caramello_man> @rytyoung only because of magic cyborg legs
[5:48:34] <MESeele> crazy jumping when convenient, then groundbound
[5:48:41] <CursedNobleman> LUL
[5:48:57] <terminusterminal> This ain't not Guild Wars Ray of Judgement.
[5:48:59] <SuperVaderMan> cool attack that doesn't track the enemies that are bouncing around the arena
[5:49:05] <+HawkGoggles2> Even big enemies would move out of the way of that laser beam.
[5:49:13] <+rytyoung> @caramello_man give Cloud a set of those bad boys and he can't carry 2 swords and one in his mouth LUL
[5:49:21] <+rytyoung> ca*
[5:49:25] <+rytyoung> can fuuuuuck
[5:49:53] <Gavaline> @SupportWriter Wasn't the mascot designed by Miyazaki, or did Miyazaki just do the title?
[5:50:02] <SupportWriter> Just the title
[5:50:04] <MESeele> have there been any real time combat in ff games that wasn't lacking?
[5:50:22] <TheWe4pon> all things that can be better implemented in a turn based system
[5:50:33] <CantButtle> that train was half transformed into a hobo home. y is it able to move??
[5:50:40] <+rytyoung> @meseele Crisis Core? never played it so have no clue personally
[5:50:59] <MESeele> Me neither, I heard it had an attack slot machine or something
[5:51:04] <arkv01> flash step
[5:51:08] <+rytyoung> We'll have I got bad news for you...
[5:51:20] <Maids4lyfe> no one likes invulnerability states
[5:51:25] <suitangi021> I guess it's so a set piece can happen for bosses
[5:51:45] <@dcn2049> The combat looks like it could have been enjoyable and interesting if they didn't vomit their terrible ideas on every encounter
[5:52:16] <oshkeet41> yeah it feels like the 'tricky' enemies arent scaled to like, the Impressiveness of the mob
[5:52:29] <+rytyoung> I do enjoy the combat, but when fights drag even though you're being optimal sucks
[5:52:32] <MESeele> working vending machine in an actual graveyard
[5:52:54] <TheWe4pon> man i hope they fix all this shit before second release.
[5:52:54] <CursedNobleman> i keep pushing the screenshot button on my switch on accident LUL
[5:52:55] <oshkeet41> yes
[5:52:55] <+HawkGoggles2> Yes people care and it's sad.
[5:52:56] <Yuroshi> yes they do
[5:52:56] <+rytyoung> Let's hope the PS5 controller is a bit better
[5:53:02] <oshkeet41> and whine about console exclusives
[5:53:12] <arkv01> yeah I don't have a goodtime reaching for the option button on when the giant one is right there
[5:53:18] <oshkeet41> (or rather when they arent exclusive anymore, months after the fact)
[5:53:26] <arkv01> time ghosts MUST WIN
[5:53:33] <SuperVaderMan> oh no, the ghost tornado stole her for some reason
[5:53:35] <+rytyoung> THANK GOD LUL
[5:53:38] <TheWe4pon> oh no it's the padding ghosts
[5:53:45] <CursedNobleman> lets go save aerith!
[5:53:48] <xeros720> spirited away is the term i think
[5:53:54] <cerazor01> Rape
[5:53:57] <GeltonZ> What REALLY?! Couldn't even be assed to kidnap her properly?!
[5:54:01] <cerazor01> ohno
[5:54:01] <medril07> pokemon?
[5:54:06] <SuperVaderMan> Can the Nomura ghosts have a fist fight with these ghosts
[5:54:07] <+TheDeadpoolDash> I stopped caring about consoles once I moved exclusively to PC. Maybe a Nintendo console every now and then.
[5:54:20] <+HawkGoggles2> This ghost is sad, or in a prison gang.
[5:54:23] <oshkeet41> Honestly, my biggest gripe is we have these ghosts and the weird timeghosts but theyre apparently different things
[5:54:24] <GeltonZ> Oh wait was that a non-plot ghost?
[5:54:30] <oshkeet41> id just assume its the same
[5:54:33] <arkv01> yeah its yo boy eli
[5:54:35] <xeros720> i want to ask you guys, how far do you think aerith was moved?
[5:54:40] <GeltonZ> Wait...ROBOT GHOST?
[5:54:47] <BurdRightsActivist> PLOT GHOSTS PLOT GHOSTS PLOT GHOSTS PLOT GHOSTS PLOT GHOSTS
[5:54:48] <TheWe4pon> people are literally dying right now
[5:54:49] <+rytyoung> @xeros720 round the corner LUL
[5:54:59] <@dcn2049> god dammit
[5:55:01] <@dcn2049> ghost children
[5:55:05] <+ATorL> children!
[5:55:09] <@dcn2049> Even worse than orphans
[5:55:11] <arkv01> even in death
[5:55:15] <SuperVaderMan> Even when the children are dead they won't stay away
[5:55:16] <Tommyrats> Who cares about helping the people about to die when you can help the ones already dead :)
[5:55:17] <suitangi021> Think of the children Plague
[5:55:21] <+rytyoung> You can't find me if im deaaaaaad
[5:55:24] <MESeele> phoenix down that child ghost zombie
[5:55:25] <@dcn2049> yeah but you can't kill them again
[5:55:26] <%caramello_man> no kill them - oh wait they're already dead
[5:55:30] <gnollAUS> No hold bars Plague
[5:55:32] <+rytyoung> she's super cute
[5:55:35] <+stephane3012> i skipped this cutscen because i couldn't careless
[5:55:36] <xeros720> as we have proved, we can make them deader
[5:55:46] <arkv01> make her eat a pot of boiled eggs
[5:55:56] <@dcn2049> She's allergic to taco bell
[5:55:58] <+rytyoung> @stephane3012 buttttttt the ghooooosts
[5:56:01] <GeltonZ> WTF Aerith's kid hair is weirdly close to Tiffany from Rival Schools.
[5:56:07] <MESeele> boy that camera is just hoping for that panty shot
[5:56:16] <MESeele> that angle
[5:56:32] <+rytyoung> Her mum didn't come find her after telling her to hide
[5:56:39] <MESeele> lol
[5:56:45] <+AgroHatesWater> Im going to capture her and feed her Taco Bell got me real good
[5:56:54] <$jamarartdoodles> Feeding her taco bell would give her mad shits. That's child endangerment
[5:56:55] <CursedNobleman> ELIGOORRRRRRRR LUL
[5:56:57] <$Rivalshotzgp> WHAT ABOUT THE DISK
[5:56:57] <SuperVaderMan> Btw, the plate's still about to fall. This is completely unrelated
[5:56:57] <TheWe4pon> Hey does anyone remember that youtbuer that the dev team used to watch during development for motivation?
[5:56:58] <+LordSDB> Maybe those were kids she knew, but are now dead?
[5:57:01] <+rytyoung> That's an Eligor for sure
[5:57:02] <oshkeet41> okay but lemme just get that as a summons.
[5:57:04] <arkv01> grinding? No way, degenerate!
[5:57:12] <BurdRightsActivist> @TheWe4pon !MAX AT RISK!
[5:57:13] <xeros720> ahahaha
[5:57:14] <GeltonZ> AND THEN THE PLATE FALLS ON THEM MID FIGHT THE END!
[5:57:23] <+rytyoung> It's not that bad, ice spells all the way
[5:57:24] <xeros720> good luck plague
[5:57:35] <$Rivalshotzgp> WHT ARE THEY STILL FIGHTING GHOSTS
[5:58:04] <+rytyoung> We still hunting spirits what of it
[5:58:08] <MESeele> well, he fought some wyverns too
[5:58:20] <MESeele> who were just hanging out
[5:58:47] <CursedNobleman> the striking staff looked bladed in the OG
[5:58:56] <+rytyoung> Wish I got it on my first playthrough BibleThump
[5:58:57] <%caramello_man> everytime!
[5:59:32] <+rytyoung> LIL
[5:59:53] <KaiserMario> If only there was a way to assess the enemy's weakness...
[6:00:05] <SuperVaderMan> Looks like you bounce off the wheels
[6:00:11] <Gavaline> @SupportWriter My mistake - thanks for the correction.
[6:00:16] <xeros720> just the wheels
[6:00:18] <terminusterminal> Oh my god is that actual locational immunity? Is it his wheels? Can you even aim well in this game?
[6:00:25] <SupportWriter> np
[6:00:36] <metalwater8> Wheels are invincible for some reason
[6:00:58] <+rytyoung> That's annoying too
[6:01:09] <CursedNobleman> 4Head
[6:01:19] <@dcn2049> the noises they make doesn't help either
[6:01:39] <+rytyoung> Physical attacks work
[6:01:40] <arkv01> why all these babby summons gotta have that incurable skull tumor condition :(
[6:01:58] <MESeele> mastermind + gem
[6:02:52] <xeros720> i remember it wearing off fairly quick
[6:02:57] <+rytyoung> He's a cute boi
[6:03:49] <+rytyoung> @arkv01 they all have big brains is all
[6:04:01] <+valiard> Why didnt they use 15s carbuncle design
[6:05:40] <CursedNobleman> they wanted to spread brain cancer awareness
[6:05:56] <+rytyoung> Stop can help with basics but not bosses
[6:06:19] <suitangi021> If only enemies had the same type of hit stun you suffer from
[6:06:19] <@dcn2049> woo cutscenes in battle
[6:06:33] <mapimb> why did we need to see that
[6:06:37] <+rytyoung> Chocobo chick is definitely a hellspawn
[6:06:37] <+stephane3012> wind and ice feel worse to use compared fire and lightning cause they detonate late
[6:06:56] <xeros720> oh, now you can hit the wheels
[6:07:01] <+rytyoung> @stephane3012 very true
[6:09:23] <Kampler21> this looks tedious as hell lol
[6:09:30] <arkv01> that aoe heal shoulda done some deepz to the ghostie
[6:09:39] <medril07> headshot
[6:10:03] <+rytyoung> It's definitely a slog of a chapter
[6:10:40] <+rytyoung> If only Barrett was here...
[6:10:56] <dildozerfred> Why not smack the wheel? I don’t understand this puzzle boss
[6:11:04] <@dcn2049> But it's fast and exciting and flamboyant! You should love what they've done to the game!
[6:11:14] <CrowbarFacelift> Plague Swears At FF7-R

[6:11:17] <Sokumotanaka> PJSalt PJSalt
[6:11:22] <@dcn2049> load of stupid bullshit
[6:11:41] <GoopyEuclid> Is there no option in this one to go turn based?
[6:11:44] <TheWe4pon> the rules in these fights change way to much
[6:11:54] <mapimb> just kill it with Tifa's limit
[6:11:54] <KaiserMario> WIPEOUTS
[6:11:59] <mapimb> please
[6:12:00] <arkv01> no turn based, it would change the game drastically I suspect
[6:12:05] <+rytyoung> psaBig psaHoldon
[6:12:05] <+ziplockfriday> it's like dark souls
[6:12:07] <arkv01> turn based alternative would've been awesome tho
[6:12:08] <agadejobi> Oh jesus
[6:12:09] <%caramello_man> amaaaaaaaaazing
[6:12:17] <mapimb> noooooo
[6:12:19] <KaiserMario> @PlagueOfGripes Remember if you lose, you'll have to steal again
[6:12:21] <GoopyEuclid> Ah balls. :/ oh well
[6:12:28] <+rytyoung> BibleThump
[6:12:31] <CursedNobleman> F
[6:12:35] <Sokumotanaka> F
[6:12:39] <arkv01> effu
[6:12:39] <mapimb> literally fuming
[6:12:41] <+rytyoung> @plagueofgripes Wreck it with ice spells
[6:12:42] <Kampler21> Try to assess his weakness
[6:12:45] <KaiserMario> LUL
[6:12:46] <%JailShmixRemix> Why do game devs not like turn based mechanics anymore?
[6:12:52] <Sokumotanaka> ^
[6:12:53] <arkv01> I mean, the boss fights are kinda ehh yeah
[6:12:55] <%caramello_man> no you love it
[6:12:56] <SuperVaderMan> Cool that javelins just appear on top of you while you're locked in animations :)
[6:12:59] <Sokumotanaka> @JailShmixRemix FR
[6:13:02] <+thefakeh> you cant hit it with ice spells because the fuckin thing runs off before it explodes
[6:13:08] <arkv01> some parts are needlessly stretched, this graveyard has been the worse so far
[6:13:09] <CursedNobleman> @JailShmixRemix its usually not very interactive
[6:13:12] <KaiserMario> Took you long enough... LUL
[6:13:16] <TheWe4pon> I think im actually gonna pass on this game too when it comes to PC
[6:13:21] <+stephane3012> a literal f you phase. going around swinging a big stick of death
[6:13:26] <GoopyEuclid> I find it’s fun to watch but man do I not wanna play iy
[6:13:27] <@Nightbot> Plague is a youtube animator and also streams at https://picarto.tv/Plague . Also: t-shirts! http://goo.gl/lze8QO
[6:13:46] <%JailShmixRemix> It's more interactive than hitting square a bunch of times then dodging then hitting square
[6:13:48] <+ziplockfriday> you need to do more damage
[6:13:50] <arkv01> the stun and sleep states feel really not good
[6:13:52] <mapimb> this game could have way more fun
[6:14:02] <+rytyoung> Wait how come I've never heard of Picarto?
[6:14:08] <terminusterminal> There is so much sleep in this game. Is the headband a mandatory accessory?
[6:14:17] <TheWe4pon> nut at what cost is interactivity?
[6:14:18] <Sokumotanaka> @CursedNobleman Turn based strategy is very interactive. IT's more so than pressing X a bunch and getting numb to fun
[6:14:19] <crovvv> Man these kinda games are always just ruined by your characters not having good enough ai to survive by themselves...
[6:14:21] <CursedNobleman> most turn based games have an autocombat function or even more interactive ones have you match an elemtn like pokemone or persona
[6:14:44] <CursedNobleman> a ton of games dont have particularly engaging combat
[6:14:44] <+rytyoung> @terminusterminal It can help, but there's way more better accessories down the line
[6:14:50] <Sokumotanaka> @JailShmixRemix THANK YOU!
[6:14:53] <+thefakeh> steal?
[6:14:54] <hcsarg1986> I wish you could have four party members in this game.
[6:15:10] <arkv01> "BUT THATS NOT CANOOOOON"
[6:15:14] <+stephane3012> is that a glitch?
[6:15:18] <+rytyoung> @hcsarg1986 likewise, especially later on in the game
[6:15:22] <mapimb> I miss Barret
[6:15:28] <arkv01> seriously though the only time you can have 4 members is at shinra HQ for a relatively shrot amount of time
[6:15:36] <+LordSDB> Don't forget to steal again
[6:15:48] <+rytyoung> @arkv01 it could've been five BibleThump
[6:15:49] <arkv01> not a huge deal for this episode but we'll see how they take feedback for episode 2
[6:15:58] <TheWe4pon> IS this one of those real summon fights?
[6:16:13] <arkv01> yeah its SUPER fucked red isn't playable, but I guess time constraints
[6:16:37] <cyberblueneon> since the reception to the game is mostly positive, they probably wont fix any of this
[6:16:37] <mapimb> !uptime
[6:16:38] <@Nightbot> 6 hours 16 minutes 47 seconds
[6:16:50] <sad_toast_> 🤦
[6:16:53] <GoopyEuclid> Wait so you can lose your spell on a fucking edge like that?
[6:16:54] <+rytyoung> @arkv01 I think they must've felt that you would've only got to play him for the last hours, so you wouldn't have got time to level him up maybe?
[6:16:56] <Kampler21> @arkv01 Inb4 they double down on the flaws
[6:17:16] <+ziplockfriday> the crate will block damage
[6:17:17] <hcsarg1986> @rytyoung I assume they only had three in the original because of processing limitations? Were they just being lazy this time?
[6:17:26] <arkv01> even that tiny bit of playing red would've been nice as a tease for the next episode
[6:17:32] <SuperVaderMan> javelin slowly appearing above you LUL
[6:17:38] <KaiserMario> @PlagueOfGripes You can do this tomorrow... there's no need to slit your wrists on him today
[6:18:00] <+rytyoung> true, would've been better he was playable in some capacity, cool he wasn't cut entirely
[6:18:16] <arkv01> yeah you've been streaming for a good while so if you wanna grab some food and see how you feel after that, all good
[6:18:29] <GoopyEuclid> ^this
[6:18:37] <mapimb> whyyyy
[6:18:39] <+rytyoung> @hcsarg1986 And it's normally 3 man parties in FF games, and they were probably trying to stick to the originals set up, including party members
[6:18:59] <+rytyoung> maybe once FF 7 r 2 comes out there will be slight bigger party sizes
[6:19:01] <mapimb> watching this just makes me wanna play kh2fm
[6:19:33] <+rytyoung> I don't know what I prefer, this or KH2...
[6:20:24] <CursedNobleman> FF9 has a 4 man party, making it the superior final fantasy LUL
[6:20:34] <mapimb> kh2 bosses were way more fun and fair for the most part
[6:20:38] <KaiserMario> The levels of salt are palpable... PJSalt
[6:20:49] <+rytyoung> @cursednobleman best game LUL
[6:20:54] <arkv01> wag that javelin dry
[6:20:55] <CrowsSanctuary> Behold the late night plague! stay still he scares easily.
[6:21:02] <CrowbarFacelift> He has a weak flow
[6:21:04] <%JailShmixRemix> He's gotta shake it
[6:21:08] <+stephane3012> LUL
[6:21:20] <+ziplockfriday> try dodging the javalins

[6:22:01] <arkv01> aeris for tennis nationals
[6:22:03] <terminusterminal> I think?
[6:23:01] <$jamarartdoodles> Steal
[6:23:08] <KaiserMario> @PlagueOfGripes Hey did you manage to steal the pointy stick from the boss yet? I think I missed it
[6:23:30] <arkv01> LUL
[6:23:37] <arkv01> nah I hate this boss just from watching his mechanics
[6:23:38] <+rytyoung> Ice is it's weakness
[6:23:46] <arkv01> I guess shiva summon then huh?
[6:23:51] <+ziplockfriday> you can use cure to regain hp
[6:24:12] <Shemegory> To defeat the Eligor, hit it until it dies
[6:24:13] <GoopyEuclid> Maybe it’s because I’m watching this on mobile, but I can’t figure this boss fight out...
[6:24:26] <CursedNobleman> plague can deal a little damage. as a treat
[6:24:30] <+SaintPyre> ha jokes on you when i stream i only get bots who advertise watchbots! psaDab
[6:24:37] <+XxBTExX> Isn't this a Dark Souls 2 boss?
[6:24:40] <KaiserMario> LUL

[6:25:05] <CursedNobleman> i am the bone of my jav
[6:25:08] <@dcn2049> why does a laser put him to sleep
[6:25:27] <KaiserMario> You know Plague... I think you're having a hard time cause you missed church today...
[6:25:27] <arkv01> now HAMMER TIME
[6:25:39] <mapimb> maybe you're supposed to go behind during the javelin thing
[6:25:55] <impartialcredit> are we beating an undead horse?
[6:26:02] <%JailShmixRemix> 5 second stagger state LUL
[6:26:03] <@dcn2049> behind and beneath him seem the safe spots, buuut how easy is it to get there
[6:26:09] <Kampler21> BRO LMAO
[6:26:12] <+ziplockfriday> if you dont like this do t try dark souls you would hate it
[6:26:12] <BurdRightsActivist> THOUGHT YOU CAN USE THE GAME'S STAGGER MECHANIC? Lol NO 4Head
[6:26:18] <arkv01> uh what?
[6:26:22] <Shemegory> to show cloud is a cool guy
[6:26:23] <Sokumotanaka> "Watch out for high winds" Is that a ff7 ref hur dur
[6:26:25] <arkv01> cloud you can just BLOCK the laser?
[6:26:27] <BurdRightsActivist> Fucking advent children shit lmao 4Head
[6:26:28] <%JailShmixRemix> SHe just got destroyed
[6:26:32] <+MrWrann> So you can't 70 to 0 during that stagger state
[6:26:42] <suitangi021> Don't you love the set piece?
[6:27:03] <CursedNobleman> its LU BU
[6:27:21] <Shemegory> can you punisher mode counter the drive by swinging?
[6:27:24] <%caramello_man> stop swinging!
[6:27:35] <@dcn2049> "if you don't like this don't try dark souls" are you being sarcastic or are you freaking serious
[6:28:15] <%JailShmixRemix> He's gonna get out of it
[6:28:46] <arkv01> eligors a filthy action replay kid
[6:28:48] <+ziplockfriday> dark souls has alot of hard bosses that can take many attempts to learn
[6:29:02] <arkv01> ziplock I can tell you're new but plague is THE dark souls guy
[6:29:04] <+MrWrann> If this game let you have a ranged DPS character this would be way better
[6:29:23] <Shemegory> you have a ranged character.. their ranged attacks miss lmao
[6:29:32] <@dcn2049> Yeah, maybe you never heard of plague before, but you're looking incredibly stupid right now
[6:29:34] <arkv01> oooh we doin it boys this is the one
[6:29:44] <Sokumotanaka> It looks like dark souls combat with ff game delays and status effects
[6:29:52] <KaiserMario> @PlagueOfGripes Could you PLEASE guest at the CSB tomorrow? Cause I'm sure Pat will sing his praises and I'd appreciate a different perspective there
[6:30:03] <TheWe4pon> Jesus this fucking game
[6:30:14] <arkv01> yeah wow we sure spent a lotta time on this ass on wheels huh haha woops plate's gone
[6:30:19] <%JailShmixRemix> The games pretty atleast guys....
[6:30:23] <+ziplockfriday> it was just an observation
[6:30:33] <@dcn2049> It's a dumb one
[6:30:43] <MilkingEdge> ITS THAT DOG
[6:30:44] <JohnClaggart> !uptime
[6:30:44] <@Nightbot> 6 hours 30 minutes 54 seconds
[6:30:49] <KaiserMario> HEY REMEMBER THE PILLAR????
[6:30:51] <Sokumotanaka> Yeah wait why didn't he help? XD
[6:30:57] <GoopyEuclid> I did like looking at the character interaction scenes but I’m glad I could just watch
[6:30:58] <SuperVaderMan> Plate's still falling btw
[6:31:02] <SuperVaderMan> while we stand here
[6:31:07] <suitangi021> While you all stare at ghost your friends are dying
[6:31:08] <+ziplockfriday> ok
[6:31:17] <Futurecity10> I really, really hope him shouting this games praises blows the fuck up in his face when he beats the game
[6:31:32] <arkv01> there's about to be a lot more dead children, this was redundant
[6:31:32] <MESeele> train accident made the children ghosts?
[6:31:35] <JohnClaggart> was that an hour just for two retries on this boss?
[6:31:48] <KaiserMario> Got a cool weapon tho... hey-ho!
[6:31:54] <Sokumotanaka> Sometimes children die
[6:31:59] <+StreamStopA> amazing AMAZING!
[6:32:00] <Zinax7> did you guys see pat's reaction the first time the time ghosts were introduced
[6:32:36] <Sokumotanaka> @Futurecity10 Now now just cause you don't enjoy it doesn't mean pat's not allowed to if he does
[6:32:37] <+MrWrann> Why no heal all button
[6:32:46] <+ziplockfriday> did he get the steal
[6:32:59] <BurdRightsActivist> PLATE'S FALLING BOYS
[6:33:05] <@dcn2049> With more orphans
[6:33:08] <BurdRightsActivist> YA MAYBE SHOULDN'T HAVE WASTED HOURS FIGHTING THOSE GHOSTS
[6:33:09] <arkv01> the village of the hidden pillar
[6:33:13] <$jamarartdoodles> Isn't Curaga aoe
[6:33:14] <suitangi021> @Zinax7 I remember him liking it and saying that they read the script
[6:33:17] <+StreamStopA> it's a plot fence
[6:33:24] <MilkingEdge> USE THAT BIG ASS SWORD TO CUT THE FENCE
[6:33:27] <+MrWrann> Or just hop the fence, they leaped like 30 feet for that ghost
[6:33:33] <@Nightbot> Plague is a youtube animator and also streams at https://picarto.tv/Plague . Also: t-shirts! http://goo.gl/lze8QO
[6:33:38] <+stephane3012> fuck them kids
[6:33:45] <Zinax7> @suitangi021 geez not even some skepticism eh?
[6:33:52] <@dcn2049> It seems like poor engineering that only one pillar supports the entire plate section
[6:33:54] <gazdropish> i love you Plague! VoHiYo
[6:33:55] <arkv01> I feel only anger at these ghost children intentionally sabotaging our progress so there can be more ghost children joining them
[6:34:11] <suitangi021> @Zinax7 He SEEMED to enjoy them
[6:34:20] <+Neoripo> I come from 20 minutes inthe future Plague. Be STRONG
[6:34:24] <JohnClaggart> that helicopter has a huge fuel tank
[6:34:32] <arkv01> wow these grunts are really gettin it
[6:34:36] <Zinax7> buy you are already negotiating
[6:34:50] <Sokumotanaka> Surrender and die!
[6:35:01] <terminusterminal> Antifa?
[6:35:04] <arkv01> wow, big antifa mood
[6:35:06] <+StreamStopA> It's not cool time yet
[6:35:09] <SuperVaderMan> oh no, not that rando
[6:35:13] <KaiserMario> It's interesting that Liam's omment on this game was also "game is so beautiful and lavish"... I wonder how much slack people are cutting this game, just because of fancy graphics, pretty songs, "look at the pretty lights mom!"...
[6:35:34] <+HawkGoggles2> Oh this bitch starts running now.
[6:35:35] <MilkingEdge> STORMTROOPERS LVLS OF SHOOTING
[6:35:39] <arkv01> until red breeds with her
[6:35:41] <Zinax7> i mean liam's not wrong
[6:35:45] <+Neoripo> Just like David cage games
[6:35:48] <BurdRightsActivist> Don't ask questions just look at the pretty lights 4Head
[6:35:49] <Zinax7> but i dunno if he played enough of it
[6:36:19] <arkv01> I think liams probably 3 hours in max
[6:36:26] <arkv01> he'll probably have more to say later
[6:36:32] <examplez0> Most people love this game up until it goes full retard in the final chapter
[6:36:37] <%JailShmixRemix> Fancy graphics Nostalgia and good music is all it takes
[6:36:38] <Sokumotanaka> @KaiserMario I doubt people are giving it slack cause of graphics songs etc if that were the case people would kiss ff13's ass and it's not as popular as 7 or any ff game
[6:36:47] <SuperVaderMan> the combat was fun in the very beginning, before they started piling on all the bullshit
[6:36:52] <CursedNobleman> liam loves the stupid anime bullshit doesnt he? LUL
[6:36:53] <+MrWrann> Why even allow you to move if you're just going to go into another cutscene
[6:36:55] <arkv01> oh MY GOD NOT NOW TIME GHOSTS
[6:37:10] <examplez0> Because it's a cinematic experience
[6:37:31] <@dcn2049> because tonight's theme is ghosts
[6:37:31] <+HawkGoggles2> Jessie, Bigs, and Wedge are still alive, you can't go through yet.
[6:37:32] <Zinax7> for those that finished the game, does this part makes sense later?
[6:37:32] <mapimb> more padding
[6:37:35] <gnollAUS> Because they want to waste time
[6:37:35] <medril07> darn ghosts
[6:37:37] <GeltonZ> DAMMIT TIME GHOSTS! Where were you when the bullshit ghost children randomly kidnapped Aerith for no raisin!
[6:37:38] <Sokumotanaka> Maybe they want bigs, weege and jessie to die first?
[6:37:39] <gnollAUS> So the plate drops
[6:37:41] <examplez0> No it doesn't
[6:37:49] <KaiserMario> @Sokumotanaka Yeah, yeah, but it does matter and tinges opinions based on it alone
[6:37:53] <examplez0> None of this time travel bullshit will ever make sense
[6:37:54] <$Rivalshotzgp> Couldn’t they have you fight shinra goons?
[6:37:56] <MilkingEdge> NOMURA PADDING
[6:38:00] <GeltonZ> I was hoping the Time Ghosts would be relateable, but they're too stupid!
[6:38:00] <TheWe4pon> they couldn't be insinuating that we were TO FAST are they?
[6:38:23] <+spacehouse> Wedge needs to fall from hundreds of feet first
[6:39:03] <arkv01> yeah time ghosts would be breaking their own prime directive
[6:39:27] <Hydrapissed> even though they them selves are breaking it by existing
[6:39:28] <BurdRightsActivist> TIME GHOSTS
[6:39:32] <Zinax7> good thing clemps are fairly subjective bout this
[6:39:56] <Zinax7> i guess this is because we were too fast
[6:40:01] <+MrWrann> Good thing those other ghosts need to fly around and do nothing while their ghost pals fight
[6:40:06] <+ziplockfriday> what is a time ghost?
[6:40:08] <KaiserMario> @Zinax7 Think like this, "does the story of KH make sense by the end?" The answer is: "kinda... yeah, more or less..."
[6:40:16] <BurdRightsActivist> Guys DA TIME GHOSTS represent the FANDOM. Wow! So Meta, MUCH DEEP
[6:40:31] <Hydrapissed> nahhhhhhhhhh its fineeee
[6:40:35] <%JailShmixRemix> What? This makes perfect sense in the story
[6:40:35] <Hydrapissed> massive ghost combos
[6:40:36] <Zinax7> @KaiserMario i gave up on the franchise after playing kh3
[6:40:42] <Sokumotanaka> @KaiserMario I mean you're basing this on plague's opinion that it's bad so I guess you're right. However I really dislike ff7 I agree with plague on alot of it's flaws but I do think like many here some are kinda overblown and liam saying it's beautiful is an opinion like how you like your burgers. IT doesn't matter in the end and who knows what his real opinion off camera or later is
[6:40:58] <CrowbarFacelift> I was pretty sure it was, but thanks
[6:41:17] <seth45er> the nomura ghosts even have same sort of hood the 13 people from HK
[6:41:18] <$Rivalshotzgp> Is the PS4 port of ff7 good?
[6:41:33] <Zinax7> we finished delaying them guys back to coffee break
[6:41:36] <+MrWrann> Why did they just fly off
[6:41:44] <Hydrapissed> fate gho0o0o0o0st
[6:41:46] <Hydrapissed> o0o0o0o0o0
[6:41:47] <Sokumotanaka> Odd
[6:41:48] <Glassbrain> Time ghosts? In MY remake of a game with no time ghosts in it?
[6:41:51] <LokimenD> Wait what just happened?
[6:41:56] <+ziplockfriday> what a mysterious game
[6:42:03] <Glassbrain> It’s more likely than you’d think!
[6:42:19] <metalwater8> Truly a mysterious jogo
[6:42:27] <Hydrapissed> time ghost GO get em
[6:42:28] <arkv01> he's FINE
[6:42:30] <BurdRightsActivist> WEDGE MORE LIKE
[6:42:30] <+spacehouse> NOO!
[6:42:32] <JohnClaggart> i guess wedge lives?
[6:42:33] <CursedNobleman> wedge is alive? lazyass timeghosts
[6:42:33] <BurdRightsActivist> DEAD-ge
[6:42:42] <Hydrapissed> and its AWESOME
[6:42:44] <LokimenD> jesus
[6:42:45] <Sokumotanaka> Cloud: I know...so am I
[6:42:45] <+eldritchhorrortwitchchat> spbE
[6:42:47] <TheWe4pon> wow I wish he died.
[6:42:51] <Zinax7> he has cats in this remake
[6:42:52] <arkv01> yeah he falls at least 100m in the original
[6:42:54] <Zinax7> so he's good
[6:42:55] <Shemegory> poor badger
[6:42:55] <+HawkGoggles2> Original game doesn't have grapples.
[6:42:58] <arkv01> this was like two floors
[6:43:00] <Sokumotanaka> Wedge lives!?
[6:43:07] <MilkingEdge> GAMER FEUL
[6:43:10] <+NoxTerminus> Wedge needs a snickers Kappa
[6:43:11] <Glassbrain> Wedge you aren’t playable.
[6:43:16] <Glassbrain> Stay back.
[6:43:16] <oshkeet41> eat them ghosts, tastes great less filling
[6:43:17] <%caramello_man> did jessie already eat it?
[6:43:20] <Hydrapissed> do these ghost remind anyone of the ghost from the movie ghost?
[6:43:23] <oshkeet41> worked for pacman
[6:43:25] <arkv01> wedge's facial features strongly remind me of laguna, I dunno why
[6:43:27] <JohnClaggart> poor charlie sheen
[6:43:39] <@dcn2049> +
[6:43:40] <KaiserMario> @Sokumotanaka I'm not denying this game is beautiful, I'm saying there are obvious flaws from the get-go, but there's a sturpor around it that seems superficial. Thus, why I wondered about people being distracted by the beauty and not taking the time to make a critical observation on the game... I think this game is good, but I'm not blind to this bs
[6:43:48] <%JailShmixRemix> I call my gun the orphan maker
[6:43:50] <Hydrapissed> oh man he gives himself hes own work
[6:43:53] <@dcn2049> That's how he kept the orphanage in business
[6:44:02] <+NoxTerminus> Just in time for that plot to go out the window ey? lobosLULN
[6:44:15] <QuiescisAnima> Need more product for the orphanarium
[6:44:23] <Hydrapissed> awww yeh oprhani
[6:44:30] <CursedNobleman> ORPHEUS
[6:44:31] <thecrazyanbu> The orphanage isn't a business but the organ trafficking is
[6:44:32] <Zinax7> orphanage?
[6:44:34] <Hydrapissed> loading boxes
[6:44:34] <arkv01> orphanajjes
[6:44:38] <Shemegory> palettes?
[6:44:40] <Zinax7> you mean the hojo organ factory?
[6:44:40] <+MrWrann> Loading hallway
[6:44:40] <oshkeet41> officer is saying what we all thinking
[6:44:41] <Glassbrain> Just because the story has taken seventeen different turns off the plot road does not mean we’re making previously non-playable characters playable.
[6:44:42] <kuzokai> loading squeeze
[6:44:45] <+NoxTerminus> gotta hide the loading door
[6:44:47] <xeros720> loading crawly bits
[6:44:48] <LokimenD> Disguise loading?
[6:44:50] <@dcn2049> You don't need an orphanage if there are no orphans, so you gotta make sure the orphan supply is steady
[6:44:55] <impartialcredit> loading ladders
[6:44:57] <+HawkGoggles2> A load point. Better than elevators.
[6:45:02] <xeros720> nah, all modern aaa games have em
[6:45:05] <+LordSDB> There in god of war too plague, and uncharted
[6:45:10] <MilkingEdge> orphanage is the new pyramid scheme
[6:45:13] <KaiserMario> @PlagueOfGripes Sure, go back to the Luminous engine... Much better... LUL
[6:45:17] <xeros720> tomb raider too
[6:45:28] <Shemegory> Yeah they should just use Luminous engine
[6:45:31] <TheWe4pon> did square use inhouse engines?
[6:45:44] <Glassbrain> If we made non playable characters playable, then you’d REALLY P.O. the fanboys.
[6:46:09] <Hydrapissed> dynasty warriors time
[6:46:09] <+ziplockfriday> do you get I framed on rolling
[6:46:14] <%JailShmixRemix> yes
[6:46:38] <arkv01> all the money sunk into luminous
[6:46:40] <Hydrapissed> Block and counter I bet
[6:46:54] <Hydrapissed> are those tables?
[6:46:56] <suitangi021> Counter them
[6:46:58] <Glassbrain> Wedge playable when
[6:47:00] <Sokumotanaka> @KaiserMario I think we're missing eah others points. I agree that there are obvious flaws but it's not with the remake its with the overall ff7 game. What I'm saying is liam or pat saying it's good doesn't mean they don't notice the flaws. When you have a person sitting down pointing out flaws and shitting on a game people tend to side with them and take any little thing as a flaw.
[6:47:04] <xeros720> also use fire magic
[6:47:06] <+NoxTerminus> gotta block the charge attack, just ignore that normal grunts have a better gap closer than you lobosLULN
[6:47:29] <hcsarg1986> Rush attacks in small arenas are always great
[6:47:30] <Shemegory> is that enemy just sniper joe
[6:47:31] <KaiserMario> @TheWe4pon For this one they tried their propietary engine and it didn't go well, so they changed to U4 and this is what we got... It's not so bad, just has some shortcomings that don't go well with this game
[6:47:34] <ThatOneGuyYouSaw> I hope I can own it like Plague when I lose all my hair..
[6:47:48] <Hydrapissed> wheres my sekiro arm axe when ya need it
[6:48:03] <examplez0> Just use magic against the shield guys
[6:48:15] <Sokumotanaka> @KaiserMario For example I watched german spy play star ocean and a dude who never saw him play it game in and got annoyed with the fast travel being a creature the party bring with them despite it being explained he only saw it as a flaw cause atm german was complaining about japan existing for no reason.
[6:48:16] <examplez0> Magic instantly wrecks them
[6:48:25] <Hydrapissed> he was taunting lol
[6:48:35] <+NoxTerminus> shield enemies are annoying when they get infinite block stamina
[6:48:48] <examplez0> Just use magic on them
[6:48:59] <+LordSDB> They should just get rid of the atb, it's not working out, especially sense they made the combat too close to kh
[6:49:07] <%CyberDingus> You came from below
[6:49:09] <Hydrapissed> lol
[6:49:10] <hcsarg1986> hypest gameplay on youtube
[6:49:10] <Glassbrain> The game looks fine from a gameplay perspective but man. The story as far as i can tell so far is a mess and two halves
[6:49:15] <xeros720> just use fire on everything
[6:49:24] <Glassbrain> Time ghosts abound
[6:49:37] <+ziplockfriday> the fight areas seem very plain
[6:49:40] <%JailShmixRemix> wdym the time ghosts add to the story :)
[6:49:42] <examplez0> Yeah the atb encourages spamming square which doesn't work when enemies have invincibility phases
[6:49:43] <xeros720> no joke, i think only one enemy absorbs fire
[6:49:52] <@dcn2049> Gameplay wise, they keep adding new gimmicks to the fighting mechanics, and never take them away
[6:50:01] <+justianxix> The only real bad points of the story I've seen is the ghost shit
[6:50:12] <Glassbrain> Though the game does seem to fall into “hallways between arenas” area design
[6:50:19] <xeros720> i hate those fucking ghosts
[6:50:39] <xeros720> they are literally expanded universe spectres
[6:50:44] <examplez0> Use the ladder
[6:50:47] <%JailShmixRemix> I wonder who the fuck thought the ghost shit was a good idea
[6:50:49] <%JailShmixRemix> LIke how
[6:50:53] <LokimenD> Jump!
[6:50:55] <kuzokai> the stairs
[6:50:57] <xeros720> i groan every time i see one
[6:50:59] <examplez0> Or try the stairs
[6:51:00] <Glassbrain> Yeah but that’s like going to a cook off and going “yeah the food sucked but everything else was fine”
[6:51:09] <Glassbrain> They’re center stage
[6:51:11] <Sokumotanaka> We dont know what the ghost are for so it's way to early to make a call
[6:51:13] <examplez0> Stairs
[6:51:19] <Futurecity10> Nomura is the reason this game is 3 parts
[6:51:24] <Ageingyoungrebel> FeelsBadMan advice friends
[6:51:36] <Glassbrain> Was nomura the ff1
[6:51:37] <Sokumotanaka> @Futurecity10 The OG as three disk
[6:51:43] <Glassbrain> Ff13 guy
[6:51:44] <Hydrapissed> yes
[6:51:48] <hcsarg1986> @Glassbrain I'm not saying the plot isn't stupid but a alternative universe remake seems like a interesting concept
[6:51:56] <Futurecity10> @Sokumotanaka 60 dollars bs 180 dollars
[6:52:00] <cyberblueneon> the original didnt make you pay full price for each disc
[6:52:01] <%JailShmixRemix> The fact that the ghosts are unexplained/unhinted at for this long isn't a good thing no matter their explanation
[6:52:03] <LokimenD> Why did it do that?
[6:52:04] <arkv01> ouch, this hurts a lot more
[6:52:06] <Hydrapissed> HA fat
[6:52:10] <cyberblueneon> and they werent released 5 years apart
[6:52:11] <Glassbrain> So part two WILL feature lightning is what you’re telling me.
[6:52:12] <arkv01> the avalanche bonding sessions man...
[6:52:13] <gnollAUS> BOUNCE BACK
[6:52:14] <TheWe4pon> why does he die and wedge lives? wtf
[6:52:15] <%CyberDingus> GIVE HIM A POTION = NO DEATH
[6:52:15] <Flamethrowerman09> HES. FAT!!!
[6:52:16] <+NoxTerminus> Its a good thing we have all this healing magic
[6:52:17] <Hydrapissed> ha FAT again
[6:52:17] <KaiserMario> @Sokumotanaka Sure, I get you. But it's exactly this effect of noticing the flaws, but overlooking them, that I was reffering to. There are other factors, of course, but ONE of them is the graphics. And I'm not being pissy at the game because of Plague, for example, I don't have as much trouble with the combat, but I can recognise what he's saying about it because I ran into those problems myself, just less often.
[6:52:20] <arkv01> THE IRONY LUL
[6:52:22] <terminusterminal> ALL THESE FAT ASSES
[6:52:23] <oshkeet41> yeah if theyre gonna kill someone off its gonna be Biggs, hes got the weakest character arc
[6:52:24] <GiygasDrillBreak> hahahaha FAT PEOPLE BOUNCE
[6:52:25] <+NoxTerminus> riiiiight? lobosLULN
[6:52:26] <examplez0> Lightning is canon in every FF universe
[6:52:27] <Sokumotanaka> @Glassbrain Nope but the ff13 crew are the new ff game team which is why ff15 was trash
[6:52:27] <@dcn2049> And thus passes the orphan maker
[6:52:37] <MESeele> everyone has a special death monologue...
[6:52:40] <MilkingEdge> WALK IT OFF BUDDY
[6:52:40] <+LordSDB> So the ghost kill Biggs but not wedge
[6:52:40] <MESeele> why
[6:52:46] <arkv01> he'll be absolutely fine
[6:52:47] <Admiral_PopnFresh> Good bye Charlie Sheen
[6:52:48] <gnollAUS> Just phoenix down him.
[6:52:50] <Glassbrain> Lightning is going to dead ass show up in part 2
[6:52:53] <Zinax7> i would've liked you as a boyfriend
[6:52:56] <Hydrapissed> and become ff8
[6:52:58] <Sokumotanaka> @Futurecity10 What are you on about?
[6:53:03] <+NoxTerminus> Nah that would infringe on Squalls copyright Kappa @PlagueOfGripes
[6:53:05] <Ageingyoungrebel> he'll be fine, right? :-(
[6:53:07] <+ziplockfriday> I think he fell on his keys
[6:53:10] <Huntercd> Charlie Sheen No!!!
[6:53:14] <examplez0> Yeah we need hungry fat guy to live out of everyone else
[6:53:16] <arkv01> he's got a fanny pack full of potions
[6:53:18] <Zinax7> the leaf house it's an organ harvesting factory
[6:53:19] <Glassbrain> Time ghosts are gonna pull lightning into part 2
[6:53:20] <hcsarg1986> I hate Japanese nod so much
[6:53:24] <+NoxTerminus> LUL
[6:53:25] <Hydrapissed> OMG head shake
[6:53:25] <%CyberDingus> CHARLIE SHEEN CHUG A POTION AND BE FINE AGAIN!
[6:53:27] <%JailShmixRemix> lmfao
[6:53:29] <JohnClaggart> cloud just casts curaga
[6:53:29] <Admiral_PopnFresh> no blood cough? come on square
[6:53:34] <+ATorL> HE'S TALKING TO YOU PLAGUE
[6:53:37] <+justianxix> Kinda true
[6:53:39] <+StreamStopA> Cloud is an asshole he has tons of healing items on him but biggs can't pay so he doesn't give him shit
[6:53:40] <GiygasDrillBreak> Biggs: "Damn, I can't comedically liberate a southeast asian country from a dictator"
[6:53:40] <Hydrapissed> head pat?
[6:53:44] <mxt8420> don't worry he gets revived at the end
[6:53:45] <Hydrapissed> little weird there bigs
[6:53:45] <Admiral_PopnFresh> chiikaPat
[6:53:45] <Lman90245> ironmo1Headpat
[6:53:48] <MilkingEdge> For a dying man he talks a lot
[6:53:51] <examplez0> Why don't they just use a phoenix down on everyone who died?
[6:53:53] <sosuke5> SeemsGood
[6:53:54] <arkv01> that head pat is going to fuel all the yaoi doujins
[6:53:54] <SuperVaderMan> SeemsGood
[6:53:57] <Admiral_PopnFresh> SeemsGood
[6:54:02] <+NoxTerminus> 'Im dying.... just let me waste 10 minutes talking when you could use healing magic on me... bleh'
[6:54:02] <%JailShmixRemix> SeemsGood
[6:54:03] <mapimb> lol
[6:54:04] <Hydrapissed> monkaS
[6:54:07] <MESeele> It has way more impact just finding their bodies
[6:54:08] <Ageingyoungrebel> SeemsGood
[6:54:09] <+claudesavegely> plague, time doesn't matteruntil it actually matters
[6:54:12] <+madnessd> bitterGun
[6:54:15] <+ziplockfriday> kiss
[6:54:15] <Hydrapissed> comfyPat
[6:54:19] <KaiserMario> @Sokumotanaka I wasn't going for a deep debate, I was just thinking that the "wow factor" matters a lot for the perception of quality in this particular game... And it's kinda of amusing to me
[6:54:19] <arkv01> sit there and slowly regenerate hp
[6:54:27] <MilkingEdge> Cloud delete my harddrive
[6:54:28] <@dcn2049> hahaha
[6:54:33] <oshkeet41> time ghosts come to pick him up in the hatchback and go for tacos
[6:54:36] <Glassbrain> Staggering was and is a bad mechanic.
[6:54:38] <LokimenD> He's gonna come back as a ghost obviously
[6:54:42] <arkv01> I need that orphanmaker to be canon now LUL
[6:54:44] <mxt8420> @MESeele: OLD GOOD NEW BAD
[6:54:48] <Kampler21> "waking up" funny that you say that Kappa
[6:54:52] <Hydrapissed> he was like caressing hes cheek that was so odd
[6:54:53] <MESeele> not wrong though
[6:54:57] <%JailShmixRemix> Orphanmaker better be canon
[6:55:02] <sosuke5> Having a cutscene of someone giving a speech as they die in a world where you have healing magic and potions is always weird.
[6:55:08] <MESeele> everyone taking forever to converse ruins is
[6:55:09] <@dcn2049> oh god that looks stupid
[6:55:11] <+NoxTerminus> that seems like a woefully dangerous mode of transportation
[6:55:21] <mxt8420> you retards just finding anything to complain lmao
[6:55:27] <MESeele> I don't even particularly like the original. It was OK
[6:55:42] <+claudesavegely> raise brings you back from unconsciousness not death
[6:55:43] <+justianxix> original deaths scene were real nothing for real nothing characters
[6:55:45] <examplez0> Rumour has it Biggs will still be dying in part 2
[6:55:50] <arkv01> I mean when you can't have jetpacks
[6:56:03] <arkv01> just have incredibly high RPM rotors
[6:56:09] <CursedNobleman> is this the future that woolie envisions?
[6:56:11] <gunsrlove> In this universe, giving SOLDIERs guns would've been a good idea
[6:56:19] <Zinax7> he had an orgasm before he died
[6:56:22] <Zinax7> what a way to go
[6:56:30] <hcsarg1986> @sosuke5 Shut up though
[6:56:33] <examplez0> Guns are pretty ineffective in this universe though
[6:56:42] <MilkingEdge> save
[6:56:53] <%CyberDingus> @examplez0 why?
[6:56:55] <+claudesavegely> I picture Hojo explaining why to give SOLDIERs swords and he just has a giant chalk board that says "BECAUSE ITS FUCKING COOL "
[6:56:59] <SuperVaderMan> Biggs could've used one of those 50 potions
[6:57:02] <Hydrapissed> I mean cloud could prob use a really big gun to cause of hes strength
[6:57:04] <+NoxTerminus> The amount of healing options feels a lot like Ds2
[6:57:09] <Sokumotanaka> @KaiserMario Yeah that's fair if you're facing the issues that you can judge and we'll leave that at that. What I am saying is you're assuming their overlooking flaws when you don't know that. Like At all you hear "Lavish: and went "well he doens't see the flaws" which is both unfair and untrue cause again if you asked them I'm sure theyd tell you. After all pat mention the flowers looking awful the floors the frozen helicopter etc
[6:57:20] <examplez0> The guns of the shinra troops are pretty weak
[6:57:21] <gunsrlove> guns are ineffective because they are being shot at the main characters
[6:57:39] <%CyberDingus> then give those bastards swords
[6:57:41] <+claudesavegely> guns don't work until they do
[6:57:46] <%JailShmixRemix> Thats a cool attack
[6:57:47] <Hydrapissed> also their is magic so idk give him a magic gun
[6:57:48] <%CyberDingus> guns that do -1 damage are not serious
[6:58:03] <gunsrlove> your gun healed me
[6:58:04] <Hydrapissed> there*
[6:58:07] <+justianxix> really got to watch that health
[6:58:22] <SoFarFetched> Biggs is a "Bigg" man
[6:58:25] <%JailShmixRemix> As plague sits with 99 potions in his pocket
[6:58:26] <arkv01> if biggs wants potions, pony up the gil
[6:58:31] <hcsarg1986> ATB seems really annoying sometimes
[6:58:31] <examplez0> Even if you give him potions the changebad ghosts will just take it away
[6:58:36] <Zinax7> would a seperate item gauge help?
[6:58:40] <arkv01> supply and demand man, these pots are extra expensive if you're dying
[6:58:48] <Hydrapissed> D m C time
[6:58:49] <MilkingEdge> sell a child for a potion
[6:59:00] <cyberblueneon> why dont the ghosts just stop you from dying
[6:59:05] <Sokumotanaka> @KaiserMario I mean neither was I, I just think it's silly go go "This person said one thing so it means they must think this." it's pretty presumptuous that's all I wanted to say.
[6:59:12] <arkv01> these time ghosts aren't very good at their job
[6:59:13] <Zinax7> game over is a failure of the game designer
[6:59:43] <KaiserMario> @Sokumotanaka Again bud... I'm not "assuming", I said "I wonder..." because I don't know how much impact it has on their opinion... Get it? "I wonder, how much they tolerate because of it"... you know?
[6:59:49] <+ziplockfriday> atb is like dooms ammo cycle
[7:00:04] <SuperVaderMan> It sure is cool that every enemy attack staggers you, but they ignore everything :)
[7:00:07] <TheWe4pon> why do enemies have super armor but we don't?
[7:00:14] <Shemegory> early souls game ruined us, since the enemies played by the same mechanics
[7:00:22] <Hydrapissed> Ds2 way more with the infinite over head slams
[7:00:24] <%JailShmixRemix> artificial difficulty
[7:00:27] <+stephane3012> the super armor gets ridiculous later on
[7:00:29] <gunsrlove> " excuse me, sir, your helicopter arm is goofy and you are stupid virgin"
[7:00:34] <gunsrlove> ENEMY DEFEATED
[7:00:55] <LokimenD> Is Plague just bad at the game or are fights supposed to be this annoying? LUL
[7:01:06] <+NoxTerminus> Is this toward endgame here?
[7:01:07] <+justianxix> a bit both
[7:01:07] <Sol_Install> they're annoying tbh
[7:01:08] <TheWe4pon> fights are bad
[7:01:09] <Hydrapissed> hes brain is off right now loki
[7:01:09] <Sokumotanaka> @KaiserMario That's not what your original comment said. But Again as you said "I'm not looking for a debate myself
[7:01:09] <+NoxTerminus> for this part anyway
[7:01:15] <Zinax7> plague's brain is off atm
[7:01:18] <Sol_Install> and plague just wants to mash
[7:01:20] <%caramello_man> @gunsrlove "aww you didn't have to say that last part"
[7:01:21] <%JailShmixRemix> Probably a bit of both
[7:01:32] <Sokumotanaka> @LokimenD Both?
[7:01:35] <Lman90245> That seems horrible
[7:01:42] <examplez0> Enemies don't even flinch from your heaviest attacks but you get stunlocked if they so much as sneeze on you
[7:01:43] <LokimenD> Fair
[7:01:44] <%JailShmixRemix> the games combat isn't particularly great
[7:01:46] <Djinnazz> that would get boring fast
[7:01:50] <gazdropish> FF7R is the Dark Souls of Kingdom Hearts
[7:01:53] <KaiserMario> @Sokumotanaka Frankly, it's presumptious of you to get way too deep into me like that, given you know nothing about me, and I know plenty of them... But sure thing man, "it's not what I said" You seem to know me better than my mom
[7:01:56] <gunsrlove> " Welcome Soldier: you are now part of the diving gimp suit helicopter arm division. Carry yourself with pride. "
[7:02:00] <+stephane3012> kotaku said that easy mode is too easy though
[7:02:00] <mizamar> D:
[7:02:16] <LokimenD> Oh hey Reno
[7:02:33] <+ziplockfriday> does this game have a narrative mode?
[7:02:39] <+NoxTerminus> why do you have stupid eyeliner?
[7:02:43] <+NoxTerminus> I dont like this guy
[7:02:58] <MilkingEdge> That's SOLDIER 1st class to you
[7:03:09] <hcsarg1986> Reno's breasts are huge
[7:03:09] <GeltonZ> @ziplockfriday It has "Classic Mode" where the game plays itself except you have to interrupt to do spells.
[7:03:11] <+NoxTerminus> must be .22 LR Kappa
[7:03:16] <gunsrlove> it's a .22 gatling
[7:03:35] <+whiskey_wolfe_> This remake does NOT know when to end a scene.
[7:03:38] <Sokumotanaka> @KaiserMario For a guy who didn't want a deep debate you're sure gungho on continuing it. You're thg one who started assuming thing about other people but whatever, go about your night and just ignore what I said. It's too much of a hassle now.
[7:03:42] <LokimenD> Wait, shouldn't Reno about Cloud's deal because of what happend in Crisis Core?
[7:03:56] <examplez0> what
[7:03:59] <KaiserMario> @Sokumotanaka Ok bud!
[7:04:14] <Tommyrats> The direction of these scenes is so awkward
[7:04:17] <sosuke5> Maybe get away from the pillar
[7:04:18] <Shemegory> Tifa can kick a stack off alling pipes, gets stopped by an iron wire fence
[7:04:18] <+ATorL> okay but wedge has to die somehow
[7:04:22] <+NoxTerminus> why are they sitting under the debris field?
[7:04:31] <+justianxix> Those time ghosts should be fired
[7:04:32] <Sokumotanaka> @KaiserMario Okay will suffice
[7:04:39] <+MrWrann> As he's drinking a potion
[7:04:42] <KaiserMario> @Sokumotanaka Okay
[7:04:46] <+StreamStopA> Does heal magic not work on the plebs
[7:04:46] <Flamethrowerman09> You fell over a hundred feet, how are you still standing!?
[7:04:54] <LokimenD> @ATorL Not if Nomura has anything to say!!
[7:04:56] <%JailShmixRemix> As cloud walks away and downs 10 potions
[7:04:57] <Hydrapissed> close
[7:05:01] <gunsrlove> hums
[7:05:03] <Lman90245> Aerith doyCry
[7:05:03] <gunsrlove> huhs
[7:05:05] <gunsrlove> ughs
[7:05:06] <+NoxTerminus> Ive never understood the attachment to Aerith
[7:05:07] <Kidbizzaro> Oh god i hate him
[7:05:08] <gunsrlove> mouth noises
[7:05:08] <Hydrapissed> 👍
[7:05:16] <TalisKanju> Wait what?
[7:05:20] <$jamarartdoodles> Plz kiss
[7:05:28] <examplez0> He runs fast for a fatty
[7:05:29] <Sol_Install> holy shit why
[7:05:33] <Kidbizzaro> Please kill him
[7:05:33] <+ATorL> I bet wedge ends up dying on this misadventure
[7:05:37] <+NoxTerminus> now he's running around like he's just fine.
[7:05:37] <Hydrapissed> how did wedge fall over
[7:05:37] <Sokumotanaka> Oh so Wedge lives just to fail protecting Aerith because they want to fuck him over.
[7:05:40] <Hydrapissed> hes like 400 pounds
[7:05:50] <%JailShmixRemix> U got this wedge
[7:05:51] <TalisKanju> Wedge doesn't die here? Also you play as Aerith here?
[7:05:54] <Sol_Install> FUCKING EAT THEM OR SOMETHING
[7:05:57] <%JailShmixRemix> No
[7:05:57] <arkv01> henshin wedge
[7:05:59] <arkv01> become a monster
[7:06:00] <Sol_Install> WHY ARE WE WASTING TIME
[7:06:03] <TheWe4pon> tick tock tick tock
[7:06:09] <SuperVaderMan> ResidentSleeper
[7:06:12] <Sokumotanaka> They said his name plague
[7:06:13] <+MrWrann> Those soldier who are in ear shot
[7:06:17] <Zinax7> FINAL DESTINATION
[7:06:19] <+NoxTerminus> Nope, she's just the annoying perfect princess stereotype who's always optimistic and makes everyone around her want to die.
[7:06:20] <Tommyrats> Has Wedge read the script too?
[7:06:20] <Hydrapissed> monkaS oh man its final destination
[7:06:20] <arkv01> the time ghosts are in your gut
[7:06:29] <examplez0> OH MY GOD WHO THE HELL CARES
[7:06:30] <gunsrlove> Heh heh heh heh heh somthing in his gut he says
[7:06:31] <Sol_Install> character development... fucking great
[7:06:32] <+stephane3012> people in this game act like theynow each other even though they just met
[7:06:39] <SuperVaderMan> "Maybe I should give up" "No you can't give up" ok, thanks anime
[7:06:45] <Hydrapissed> I hope it was
[7:06:45] <arkv01> he probably ate a few ghosts, gluttonous lad
[7:06:45] <%JailShmixRemix> That looked like a person
[7:06:45] <Sol_Install> it's fine
[7:06:47] <+LordSDB> robot?
[7:06:51] <Sokumotanaka> He's good
[7:06:52] <Hydrapissed> BUH
[7:06:57] <examplez0> That was underwhelming
[7:06:58] <Hydrapissed> wouldnt that guard just shoot wedge
[7:06:58] <mapimb> lol
[7:07:01] <arkv01> WEDGE HULK
[7:07:04] <gazdropish> Nice anime speech
[7:07:07] <Sokumotanaka> Wedge just snaps his neck
[7:07:10] <%caramello_man> ewww you're so fat
[7:07:14] <mizamar> this is so anime bruh
[7:07:16] <+NoxTerminus> why....

[7:07:26] <%JailShmixRemix> Thanks newbie
[7:07:30] <mapimb> did that actually fucking work
[7:07:33] <Kidbizzaro> Cowardice wins the day again
[7:07:35] <SuperVaderMan> New Officer-kun PogChamp
[7:07:37] <hcsarg1986> The soldiers are moved by their friendship
[7:07:44] <+ATorL> I'll die offscreen!
[7:07:45] <Sol_Install> this is beyond dumb
[7:07:46] <Hydrapissed> 👍
[7:07:51] <Sunstalker> Guns are juist a fashion statement :)
[7:07:58] <+MrWrann> Those soldiers had guns why were they intimidated by Wedge
[7:08:01] <gunsrlove> You can tell this is made for kids
[7:08:06] <Sokumotanaka> OH GOD THE CATS!?
[7:08:19] <arkv01> well yeah, RUN
[7:08:19] <Lman90245> Yeeah they're trying to kill everyone in the lower city
[7:08:22] <Sokumotanaka> Someone save the dogs and cas!
[7:08:27] <@dcn2049> Why, the hell, is this so hard to convey to people
[7:08:33] <examplez0> They're gonna drop the plate on us let's talk about it for 10 minutes
[7:08:34] <KaiserMario> it's so weird how long it takes to get here...
[7:08:39] <+ziplockfriday> her dress has stayed remarkably clean throughout this
[7:08:49] <@dcn2049> to be fair, chicago deserves it
[7:08:49] <Sol_Install> this should have been way shorter
[7:09:01] <sosandstorm> good riddance, i say
[7:09:07] <TalisKanju> Now that I look again, Aerith's face looks really weird
[7:09:10] <%JailShmixRemix> One
[7:09:13] <CrowbarFacelift> LUL
[7:09:13] <Hydrapissed> wtf
[7:09:13] <arkv01> it's cool they're letting us play this offscreen development from the OG
[7:09:15] <cyberblueneon> if it was shorter they couldnt have charged 60 bucks for it
[7:09:16] <kiwicoffin> I get the impression Aerith is just emotionally disconnected from humans
[7:09:17] <Zinax7> PLAGUE IS THE PLOT GHOST ALL ALONG
[7:09:19] <$jamarartdoodles> America would do some dumb shit like that lol
[7:09:20] <+ATorL> RIGHT ONTO WEDGE

[7:12:55] <Sunstalker> Walk 20 feet for your next cutscene, is such a annoying thing to see games because it means they didn't plan it well enough to join the cinematics together

[7:13:21] <Sol_Install> 4 cutscenes
[7:13:23] <Zinax7> you're super wrong plague

[7:19:52] <MilkingEdge> Chad pipes vs Virgin Stairs
[7:19:54] <sosandstorm> "Damn it! Do you got it memorized?"
[7:19:54] <arkv01> this game isn't even trying to hide tifa is your long term squeeze
[7:19:57] <+HawkGoggles2> I'm glad the Turks are looking like shit lords earlier this time.
[7:20:05] <sadboy_otoroshi> She's plenty beeg y'know
[7:20:11] <+LordSDB> So 7, 8 cutscenes until back to gameplay
[7:20:44] <+NoxTerminus> 'gameplay
[7:20:45] <MilkingEdge> FF7 cutsence remake
[7:20:50] <arkv01> heheh asset
[7:20:56] <+NoxTerminus> FF7 Re-re-remake
[7:21:04] <%JailShmixRemix> ^ can't wait for it
[7:21:06] <Hydrapissed> why would they let them fly off like that for real lol
[7:21:12] <Hydrapissed> making u use mp
[7:21:22] <BillieNoMates> So where did Rude having the hots for Tifa come from?
[7:21:24] <+NoxTerminus> I was mildly interested in this game
[7:21:25] <+whiskey_wolfe_> How we all feeling about Part 1, Disc 1 of FF7 getting the Hobbit Trilogy treatment?
[7:21:28] <BillieNoMates> Compilation shit?
[7:21:30] <+NoxTerminus> but I suppose I'll just go back to FF14
[7:21:35] <arkv01> @BillieNoMates in gongaga
[7:21:41] <Shemegory> but magic missile can't miss plague
[7:21:44] <@dcn2049> But, magic missile always hits...
[7:21:46] <Hydrapissed> and u cant aim them right?
[7:21:47] <TalisKanju> PERFECT
[7:21:52] <GiygasDrillBreak> guys...in the original game, Rude says he has the hots for Tifa in Junon
[7:21:53] <LokimenD> @BillieNoMates He's just a man of taste. I mean have you seen his sunglasses?
[7:21:56] <examplez0> Use magic on the shields
[7:22:00] <Kidbizzaro> Cover based combat, Plague
[7:22:04] <TalisKanju> These guys are going to die either way
[7:22:14] <availablethor> I’m liking it. It’s only the Eva Rebuild parts that bother me.
[7:22:25] <arkv01> the rebuild ghosts need to retire yes
[7:22:25] <examplez0> He said in Gongaga actually
[7:22:26] <LokimenD> That's fair
[7:22:37] <+NoxTerminus> The combat seems real jank
[7:22:39] <sadboy_otoroshi> Ice magic does even do contact damage at all?
[7:22:46] <dogekingjojo> Somehow I just can't deal with the shield enemies when using Cloud's big, dumb sword Kappa
[7:22:54] <GiygasDrillBreak> oh you're right it was gongaga. he and Reno talking about who is hot
[7:22:55] <Hydrapissed> tables beat swords
[7:23:13] <hcsarg1986> Until the plate collapses
[7:23:20] <+ATorL> Soon
[7:23:21] <availablethor> If this was a PC game I there’d be a mod that cuts all the rebuild shit in no time.
[7:23:23] <+ATorL> maybe now
[7:23:27] <+NoxTerminus> why did they give her madonna boob plate armor?
[7:23:28] <arkv01> now she dead?
[7:23:34] <Hydrapissed> THEY gana do it
[7:23:34] <+NoxTerminus> in the original she had a normal plate vest...
[7:23:37] <%JailShmixRemix> PLAGUE STOP READING THE SCRIPT
[7:23:38] <KaiserMario> LUL
[7:23:40] <LokimenD> How are those guys not dead from a point blank grenade?
[7:23:43] <arkv01> does she eat her own grenade?
[7:23:45] <KaiserMario> Oh boy...
[7:23:47] <Hydrapissed> GHOST PUSH HER off
[7:23:48] <+ATorL> she threw the pin on accident
[7:23:54] <Hydrapissed> lol
[7:23:59] <+NoxTerminus> She's not WW2 Italy @ATorL lobosLULN
[7:23:59] <+claudesavegely> probably just made her miss
[7:24:06] <sadboy_otoroshi> your hand should have blown right there
[7:24:09] <gunsrlove> ....didn't even get the coochie ;( ;(
[7:24:24] <VeryTricky> Wtf are these “time ghosts”
[7:24:31] <Sokumotanaka> @gunsrlove She was a SIIIMP
[7:24:33] <%JailShmixRemix> Nomura ghosts
[7:24:49] <sadboy_otoroshi> Plot conveniences ghosts.
[7:24:50] <Huntercd> So the ghost exist keep the old canon? What the fuck?Why even include them?
[7:24:55] <LokimenD> Honestly the ghosts wouldn't bother me as much as they do if they had a more interesting design
[7:25:04] <examplez0> Just use magic on them
[7:25:13] <Hydrapissed> a mini mini mini boss
[7:25:13] <LokimenD> At least they could be cool to look at
[7:25:21] <graemecrackers2> is that quinton as reno ?
[7:25:22] <hcsarg1986> Reno you lost to Cloud too
[7:25:39] <+NoxTerminus> I think a lot of people are giving this game a free pass because it 'looks' great
[7:25:40] <%caramello_man> they ignored you when you tried to counter
[7:25:51] <GiygasDrillBreak> magic was real powerful in the original game, yet nobody wants to use magic in this game. why?
[7:26:06] <Sokumotanaka> @LokimenD What you dont like floating sheets loki?
[7:26:07] <arkv01> cause it feels better to smashy washy
[7:26:08] <gunsrlove> EEEEAAAYYY
[7:26:12] <+NoxTerminus> @GiygasDrillBreak because magic and items both use a gauge
[7:26:18] <hcsarg1986> Why must the characters stagger so long?
[7:26:18] <+NoxTerminus> the same gauge
[7:26:18] <availablethor> @huntercd I think Nomura is a narcissist and he’s mad that fans of the old game are screaming at him to keep the canon, and he wants to make his own story, and the ghosts are his passive aggressive representation of the fans.
[7:26:18] <+LordSDB> cause it cost atb,
[7:26:23] <arkv01> or expend ATB on physical skills
[7:26:29] <+LordSDB> and you can get hit and lose that atb
[7:26:36] <sosandstorm> fucking DS1 style lets go
[7:26:44] <sadboy_otoroshi> @NoxTerminus It's seems that the ones who say that aren't the ones playing it. But that is just me.
[7:26:46] <sosandstorm> fish for backstabs go go go
[7:26:49] <+LordSDB> and lose all ability to heal or cast magic at critical moments
[7:26:56] <GiygasDrillBreak> oh the windup for the spell is too risky? but 1 spell is like 2 physical ATB bars
[7:27:03] <+NoxTerminus> @sadboy_otoroshi graphics alone do not make a great game
[7:27:12] <examplez0> ABLOOBLOOBLOO WHY DON'T YOU LIKE MY SHITTY FANFICS FUCK YOU FANS YOU DON'T UNDERSTAND MY GENIUS
[7:27:18] <arkv01> @availablethor that explanation makes too much sense, now you must be silenced by the squenix ghosts
[7:27:19] <Kidbizzaro> look at her garbage bag hair float in the wind
[7:27:32] <Sokumotanaka> @availablethor I can only hope he's not that petty what kinda asshole would get pissy at a remake of an old game that he doens't get to make an "original story." Make ff17 then
[7:27:32] <%JailShmixRemix> Not enough potions to save biggs though
[7:27:33] <BurdRightsActivist> GENIUS NONUMBO
[7:27:40] <+NoxTerminus> The exact same smashed staircase asset
[7:27:43] <+NoxTerminus> in the same level
[7:27:44] <BurdRightsActivist> LOADING RUBBLE PogChamp
[7:27:53] <hcsarg1986> How tall is this stupid tower?
[7:28:08] <examplez0> This is like the prison at the start of disc 2 in FF8
[7:28:24] <examplez0> Just the same stairs and same levels over and over again
[7:28:30] <sadboy_otoroshi> As long as the tower from metal slug 3, was it 4...
[7:28:32] <+NoxTerminus> @hcsarg1986 pretty stupid
[7:28:39] <BillieNoMates> Biora
[7:28:53] <MilkingEdge> how many cutsence does it take to drop a pillar?
[7:29:00] <LokimenD> Bio has always been a weird spell
[7:29:08] <KellBeII> !uptime
[7:29:08] <@Nightbot> 7 hours 29 minutes 18 seconds
[7:29:17] <GeltonZ> YO! I remember the Ninjacopter Boys! Good to see them again!
[7:29:20] <Tommyrats> This pillar has been about to blow up for like 2 hours now
[7:29:20] <BurdRightsActivist> @MilkingEdge Two. One to fall it, and one to pad out the gameplay beforehand
[7:29:24] <GiygasDrillBreak> it takes 1 destruction of planet namek
[7:29:32] <+LordSDB> Before this is over, maybe 12 cutscenes
[7:29:35] <CrowbarFacelift> gotta...draw this out...just...a bit....more
[7:29:37] <hcsarg1986> @NoxTerminus Oh so very stupid
[7:29:39] <BillieNoMates> Its weird that you had barret for the reactors but then nothing after
[7:29:40] <examplez0> So Nomura is intentionally sabotaging his own series just to spite fans like Kojima did with MGS4
[7:29:40] <sosandstorm> @MilkingEdge you don't understand, they're actually fighting at near the speed of light and it's just slowed down for the viewer's sake
[7:29:41] <the_grey_ghost> holy hell this is the first time I've seen your face
[7:29:51] <the_grey_ghost> live action face
[7:30:06] <%caramello_man> live action gripes
[7:30:10] <arkv01> @the_grey_ghost everyone seems to get surprised, did you expect IRL plague to be a mass of tentacles?
[7:30:16] <%JailShmixRemix> LiveGripes
[7:30:27] <Tikigod784> Potion Energy drinks are probably a thing in Japan
[7:30:33] <MilkingEdge> oh boi that long cloud will go super saiyan
[7:30:51] <+NoxTerminus> loading door
[7:30:52] <Hydrapissed> cloud just jump to the other side
[7:30:59] <BurdRightsActivist> LOADING BEAMS 4Head
[7:31:00] <sadboy_otoroshi> Why plague doesn't just run past the encounters, it blocks the way if they not ded.
[7:31:06] <BurdRightsActivist> Genius NONUMBO
[7:31:12] <+NoxTerminus> Nomura is garbage
[7:31:15] <+NoxTerminus> at writing
[7:31:16] <+LordSDB> Ghosts....
[7:31:20] <Hydrapissed> NONUMBO and kojimbo
[7:31:20] <hcsarg1986> I just love slow walking sections
[7:31:21] <+justianxix> character designer
[7:31:22] <sadboy_otoroshi> bingo
[7:31:24] <Kidbizzaro> The Time Ghosts are Nobodies
[7:31:27] <BillieNoMates> I dont think he was anything but a character designer
[7:31:30] <BillieNoMates> TIME JANNIES
[7:31:30] <TalisKanju> You called it
[7:31:30] <sosandstorm> WAIT WHAT
[7:31:30] <Tikigod784> fashion designer
[7:31:33] <arkv01> time ghosts WIN
[7:31:33] <BillieNoMates> THEY DID IT
[7:31:36] <LokimenD> Someone really needs to invent a Proton Pack
[7:31:40] <gunsrlove> GHOST GANG
[7:31:42] <TalisKanju> Time ghosts shielded the blast
[7:31:43] <arkv01> probably blew her grenade back at her
[7:31:45] <gunsrlove> stomped her out
[7:31:45] <examplez0> He should just stick to character designs and even with that he needs somebody to keep him in check
[7:31:49] <Hydrapissed> the copter crashed into her?
[7:31:50] <sosandstorm> Just force feed her a pheonix down
[7:31:50] <BurdRightsActivist> KILL WAIFU. KILL WAIFU TO MAKE SAD. ONLY WAY TO MAKE SAD.
[7:31:51] <seth45er> fridge that bitch!
[7:31:52] <gridib> They spiked it back at her
[7:31:57] <+justianxix> They crashed the copper right into her
[7:31:58] <LokimenD> HISTORY ABHORS A PARADOX
[7:32:02] <SuperVaderMan> Sorry Jessie, I used up my last Potions LUL
[7:32:03] <examplez0> I'D CATCH A GRENADE FOR YOU
[7:32:03] <sadboy_otoroshi> she shouldn't have her right side of her body.
[7:32:04] <sosandstorm> just throw her off the side fuck it
[7:32:09] <Hydrapissed> I think the copter slammed into her
[7:32:09] <+NoxTerminus> oh no this side character is dying oh no how terrible lobosLULN
[7:32:09] <Sokumotanaka> GOD DIE SIMP
[7:32:12] <Zinax7> the ghost nathan draked the grenade
[7:32:13] <BillieNoMates> "Cloud has to bang Tifa in the Highwind, we have to remove any other potential sex candidates"
[7:32:14] <+StreamStopA> Jessie: do you have any potions on you? Cloud: nope
[7:32:22] <gunsrlove> If only we had some magic in this world
[7:32:23] <MilkingEdge> last word suck me beautiful
[7:32:23] <sosandstorm> jesus her last words are a dissertation
[7:32:32] <oshkeet41> gotta be different, but also not different enough to double back
[7:32:34] <arkv01> this is the appetizer for disc 2
[7:32:36] <TheWe4pon> so why the fuck is wedge allowed to live?
[7:32:38] <oshkeet41> like if youre gonna go there, just go there
[7:32:39] <Eger007> potion?
[7:32:39] <Kidbizzaro> Such was the lesson of Mass Effect
[7:32:40] <arkv01> somebody gotta die
[7:32:45] <BurdRightsActivist> AERITHS STANDIN LUL
[7:32:46] <Hydrapissed> wedge lived woooo
[7:32:51] <GiygasDrillBreak> this is like an opera, a 5 minute song from the character dying
[7:32:52] <hcsarg1986> @BillieNoMates No Threesomes allowed!!!!!!!
[7:32:53] <examplez0> Just use a phoenix down on her
[7:32:53] <availablethor> 50/50, I like the changes with Jessie
[7:32:56] <oshkeet41> Wedge is dumb and is rife for character develop,emt and survivors guilty
[7:32:58] <+NoxTerminus> This is especially dumb when you can have 'cure' on literally every party member
[7:32:58] <Hydrapissed> Is this game an add for pizza?
[7:33:01] <BurdRightsActivist> Just heal her 4Head
[7:33:05] <BillieNoMates> Hail in april

[7:33:35] <seth45er> there's Pizza in that fridge
[7:33:36] <+MrWrann> Do they have time for this
[7:33:40] <Sunstalker> The pizza and the cup noodles, the real heroes of Final Fantasy
[7:33:41] <mapimb> these go on for a bit too long
[7:33:42] <Sokumotanaka> Chat she's a simp thot
[7:33:45] <KaiserMario> Look at all this time they had to cast Cure, throw a Mega-Potion at her... I mean C'mon guys, at least try...
[7:33:48] <seth45er> BLARRRG!
[7:33:53] <BillieNoMates> Good ol Time Ghosts
[7:33:57] <%JailShmixRemix> You owe me a pizza was actually his last words to her wow
[7:33:58] <availablethor> Well they’re gonna get s whole slice very soon.
[7:34:00] <JohnClaggart> why do they all die the same way
[7:34:00] <BillieNoMates> Keeping the canon, canon
[7:34:03] <KaitlynnHere> Fist bump me into death cloud
[7:34:04] <+NoxTerminus> Such amazing writing
[7:34:04] <arkv01> force the pizza in her mouth
[7:34:04] <SuperVaderMan> NOW where am I gonna get pizza
[7:34:06] <sadboy_otoroshi> They have potions.
[7:34:08] <arkv01> she'll revive
[7:34:10] <seth45er> "bowels voilently empty
[7:34:11] <%CyberDingus> SHOVE A POTION DOWN HER THROAT
[7:34:13] <+HawkGoggles2> What if she took a big dump before hand?
[7:34:15] <+NoxTerminus> it really moves me, to care less lobosLULN
[7:34:16] <%CyberDingus> THIS MAKES NO SENSE
[7:34:16] <Tikigod784> poor people in the slums don't eat enough to shit themselves when they die
[7:34:16] <Hydrapissed> didnt she just fall in the orginal
[7:34:17] <hcsarg1986> Cloud angry
[7:34:18] <MilkingEdge> phoenix down
[7:34:22] <sadboy_otoroshi> Phoenix feather all over.
[7:34:25] <@dcn2049> so does phoenix down do nothing now
[7:34:25] <BurdRightsActivist> KILL WAIFU. KILL WAIFU TO MAKE SAD, ONLY WAY TO MAKE SAD. GENIUS NONUMBO
[7:34:38] <MilkingEdge> barret is dead
[7:34:40] <BillieNoMates> Phoenix Down don't stop death, just K,I
[7:34:43] <BillieNoMates> K.O
[7:34:45] <sosandstorm> @Tikigod784 why does THAT feel like a loss of dignity?
[7:34:45] <+StreamStopA> Go back and check her pockets for loot.
[7:34:45] <VeryTricky> I’m still confused what killed her
[7:34:48] <Sol_Install> lol
[7:34:50] <%JailShmixRemix> OH JESSIE
[7:34:52] <Sokumotanaka> Barret left to go get a better job
[7:34:52] <sadboy_otoroshi> She will live on to please our boners.
[7:34:55] <BillieNoMates> She blew herself up
[7:34:59] <Tikigod784> @sosandstorm major OOF
[7:35:00] <arkv01> jessie will live on in SFM land
[7:35:03] <+NoxTerminus> @BillieNoMates then use it while she's still talking and then use healing magic
[7:35:06] <availablethor> @burdrightsactivist she dies in the original
[7:35:08] <+justianxix> Arn't Phoenix downs just for knocks outs now
[7:35:18] <Hydrapissed> the copter the bomb?
[7:35:24] <@dcn2049> "The down feathers of a Phoenix would return people from the dead as a Phoenix itself does"
[7:35:24] <BurdRightsActivist> @availablethor I know, but she only got this much focus this time for the waifu kill sads
[7:35:27] <SuperVaderMan> A potion machine just up the stairs from the dead lady LUL
[7:35:29] <Sunstalker> Why didn't she just come sit on the bench. danCry
[7:35:32] <@dcn2049> Okay then.
[7:35:34] <+StreamStopA> @VeryTricky the helicopter that she crashed
[7:35:34] <examplez0> Her skin was in pretty good condition after a grenade went off in her face
[7:35:35] <TalisKanju> She was in front of the blast and got crushed by the debris
[7:35:38] <Tikigod784> everyone in sector 7 lives on a diet of eggs and chips at discount prices
[7:35:38] <+NoxTerminus> this is why introducing silly healing mcguffins ruins your ability to write compelling character deaths. HahaThink
[7:35:41] <Sokumotanaka> @PlagueOfGripes She took damage from lack of dick
[7:35:44] <sosandstorm> TELL EM
[7:35:44] <gunsrlove> " I had 19 Phoenix Downs, but the Nomura ghosts said you should die, Jessie :( "
[7:35:45] <+HawkGoggles2> Barret using is main character powers to live.
[7:35:47] <KaitlynnHere> She died of a broken heart
[7:36:01] <sosandstorm> Barret really is the main character of our hearts
[7:36:03] <+NoxTerminus> there's still healing magic though
[7:36:05] <+stephane3012> hes hiding behind gas tanks lol
[7:36:06] <oshkeet41> yeah they even reworded it here as 'unconcious' when you die in battle
[7:36:06] <%caramello_man> what is death?
[7:36:06] <+NoxTerminus> and potions, or both
[7:36:07] <+justianxix> Yeah, just Knock out
[7:36:10] <MilkingEdge> she was still alive
[7:36:12] <@dcn2049> The internet is full of lies, and so are you!
[7:36:12] <BillieNoMates> Yeah but they could have forced her to buttchug a mega potion
[7:36:14] <%CyberDingus> @PlagueOfGripes hp potions prevent death to those who are dying, no ?
[7:36:15] <+peri_d0t> Hi again
[7:36:16] <+LordSDB> I didn't know about those 3 dying, but I can;t take how they killed biggs or jessie seriously, it's a bit too funny with the ghosts forcing their deaths
[7:36:16] <+MrWrann> Can't you kill ghosts in some games with pheonix downs?
[7:36:18] <LokimenD> You're not Balthier, Barret
[7:36:20] <sosandstorm> fuck, the game is so much better with him on screen
[7:36:23] <sadboy_otoroshi> how's k.o not dead.
[7:36:24] <%caramello_man> if a giant laser doesn't kill you, then....
[7:36:31] <Sokumotanaka> but they're so red and pretty
[7:36:32] <Kidbizzaro> The explosion will give us cover
[7:36:33] <BillieNoMates> K.O is knocked out
[7:36:33] <Tommyrats> Wil anyone actually tell Barrett Jessie died or will he just read the script?
[7:36:35] <GeltonZ> Yeah those are #NotMyGhosts! I would have kept Jessie alive or at least given her a better and more natural death.
[7:36:45] <+peri_d0t> oh did i just miss the avalanche kids die
[7:36:50] <@dcn2049> Are ghost's not dead?
[7:36:50] <GiygasDrillBreak> Gi Nataak
[7:36:53] <Hydrapissed> LOL
[7:36:53] <@dcn2049> What the fucking fuck
[7:36:54] <availablethor> @burdrightsactivist that’s right. I’ll agree with that tho; due to this game o my being Midgar the 3arc structure is broken, so they gave a bit more emotional weight. I’m fine with it.
[7:36:54] <gunsrlove> Enemies dont kill you , they just knock you out
[7:36:54] <%JailShmixRemix> Bitch
[7:36:55] <+justianxix> LUL
[7:36:56] <MilkingEdge> BITCH
[7:36:56] <Hydrapissed> Bitch
[7:37:00] <Gruedo> BITCH

[7:37:19] <GeltonZ> Nothin' personnel, BITCH!
[7:37:20] <$jamarartdoodles> Wake up ghost
[7:37:25] <+NoxTerminus> you can't aim the gun and fly the helicopter with the same stick
[7:37:27] <kiwicoffin> Proceeds to dick around
[7:37:30] <+peri_d0t> his suit is baller
[7:37:30] <Kidbizzaro> Dicking around is for SFM
[7:37:31] <+NoxTerminus> why are these writers so bad zimePalm
[7:37:33] <BurdRightsActivist> Proceeds to dick around
[7:37:39] <hcsarg1986> Tackle him idiots
[7:37:41] <BillieNoMates> Barret has the IQ of a baked potato
[7:37:45] <CrowbarFacelift> 80% of this game is dicking around
[7:37:50] <GeltonZ> WHY WOULD THERE EVEN *BE* A PLATE SEPARATION PROTOCOL?!
[7:37:52] <BurdRightsActivist> THAT BUTTON TEXTURE 4Head
[7:37:56] <kiwicoffin> Just one button confirmation to drop it
[7:37:57] <examplez0> Cloud: "Durrrrrrrrrrrr oh yeah him bad me stop him"
[7:37:59] <+StreamStopA> make_plate_fall.exe
[7:38:00] <LokimenD> That's a strong stick
[7:38:00] <sadboy_otoroshi> they are dead serious, not hammy enough.
[7:38:02] <arkv01> uh, cloud?

[7:38:12] <MilkingEdge> tHROW A GRENADE AT THE PANEL
[7:38:20] <sosandstorm> "well i can't listen to cloud..."
[7:38:22] <LokimenD> OKAY THAT WAS COOL
[7:38:22] <+justianxix> Oh he's serious now
[7:38:49] <arkv01> human bosses are a LOT more nice to fight
[7:38:50] <BurdRightsActivist> Reno's gonna do some stupid song and dance 4Head
[7:38:56] <+peri_d0t> is tifa the most satisfying character to play?
[7:38:57] <Kidbizzaro> It sure is fun to watch.
[7:38:58] <Hydrapissed> barret naked lol
[7:39:02] <+NoxTerminus> He has a ton of HP
[7:39:05] <celesticv> SHINY SHINY
[7:39:05] <@dcn2049> this was shitty game design
[7:39:10] <examplez0> Why is there a button that drops the plate on everything in the first place?
[7:39:27] <LokimenD> Because Shinra
[7:39:27] <Hydrapissed> cause evil @examplez0
[7:39:28] <availablethor> Because shines is evil?
[7:39:33] <BurdRightsActivist> Bird shit lol
[7:39:34] <sosandstorm> @examplez0 what's that? a question? we don't do that here
[7:39:36] <Gruedo> man Reno's VA is so bad
[7:39:43] <Hydrapissed> oh ima rub off on yah
[7:39:43] <+peri_d0t> ^
[7:39:48] <sadboy_otoroshi> He's gonna die there!!!!
[7:39:50] <Shemegory> A Hin-d
[7:39:51] <+NoxTerminus> Barret shoot the bombs
[7:39:51] <platinumpineapple> a hind-d?!
[7:39:57] <+NoxTerminus> just shoot the bombs before they drop
[7:40:01] <+HawkGoggles2> New opponent: Attack Helicopter.
[7:40:01] <@dcn2049> why is Keegan attacking you with a helicopter
[7:40:03] <KaiserMario> Welp, you're gettin shit anyways
[7:40:06] <examplez0> Silly me how could I forget
[7:40:15] <Sunstalker> The chainlink fence will protect me from the machine gun fire danHa
[7:40:16] <availablethor> @plagueofgripes destroying buttons in fiction is the same as pushing them plague
[7:40:21] <kiwicoffin> Dang can't put the chopper to sleep. bullshit
[7:40:22] <BillieNoMates> I assume you just have to Barret it
[7:40:23] <+StreamStopA> Divekick helicopter
[7:40:29] <hcsarg1986> Why does Reno sound like a whiny bitch
[7:40:29] <Hydrapissed> no weaknesses either wtf
[7:40:32] <platinumpineapple> napalm bombs for riot pacification I assume
[7:40:52] <sadboy_otoroshi> Pretty firecrackers.
[7:40:54] <LokimenD> That was some quick burning Napalm
[7:40:58] <Hydrapissed> how rude
[7:41:04] <Hydrapissed> comfyOMEGAREE
[7:41:32] <+NoxTerminus> the party controls are very poor
[7:41:36] <availablethor> In fiction, buttons are like dams that hold the water of plot back.
[7:41:41] <+NoxTerminus> especially since the AI focuses on whoever you switch too
[7:41:44] <+NoxTerminus> regardless of aggro
[7:41:46] <LokimenD> So this is no FFXII?
[7:41:55] <BurdRightsActivist> @NoxTerminus No they're GREAT. Max said so
[7:41:59] <+justianxix> no gambits
[7:42:04] <Hydrapissed> rude just bombing nothing btw
[7:42:11] <+peri_d0t> the thing i hate most is that enemies don't naturally stagger. it feels like you're hitting a brick wakk
[7:42:13] <BurdRightsActivist> Rude out here bombing the FLOOR
[7:42:15] <+peri_d0t> wall
[7:42:30] <+NoxTerminus> @BurdRightsActivist Riiiiight. zimeTsk
[7:42:30] <BurdRightsActivist> Wakk
[7:42:32] <+NoxTerminus> no
[7:42:37] <kiwicoffin> pyramid literally tracks to whoever you control
[7:42:43] <+peri_d0t> @BurdRightsActivist you know it
[7:42:55] <availablethor> Didn’t Cloud kick this guys ass solo?
[7:43:00] <Hydrapissed> he did
[7:43:05] <Hydrapissed> but now reno has a copter?
[7:43:06] <Hydrapissed> idk
[7:43:15] <LokimenD> Reno is serious now
[7:43:19] <+NoxTerminus> Your characters get staggered by everything, enemies? Nah.
[7:43:25] <BurdRightsActivist> Reno is motivated now
[7:43:34] <availablethor> Ah, he’s now using 50% of his power
[7:43:46] <+NoxTerminus> Being more motivated doesnt make taking a table sized sword to the face any easier HahaThink
[7:43:49] <+Solid_Stro> @burdrightsactivist The Vergil Effect
[7:43:51] <%JailShmixRemix> Wait till reno goes super saiyan, then you'll be sorry
[7:44:04] <Hydrapissed> wait till reno gets TWO COPTERS
[7:44:07] <+justianxix> also, why can't enemies get stronger with time like the player
[7:44:08] <LokimenD> @NoxTerminus I guess you never had the proper motivation then
[7:44:26] <platinumpineapple> what's his motivation? overtime pay?
[7:44:47] <%caramello_man> @justianxix
[7:44:47] <Hydrapissed> its MGR
[7:44:48] <Kampler21> really wish you could grind in this game
[7:44:52] <%caramello_man> woops
[7:44:54] <LokimenD> Also, I'm pretty sure Rude could more damage on the ground than using the helicopter
[7:45:09] <+StreamStopA> the camera is great
[7:45:09] <Sokumotanaka> As one does to a helicopter
[7:45:12] <KaiserMario> Now this is some Dierge of Cerberus shit! LUL
[7:45:21] <+NoxTerminus> How is Rude piloting the helicopter and aiming and firing the gun with the same flight stick?...
[7:45:26] <+NoxTerminus> Anime bs? Ok
[7:45:31] <Sokumotanaka> rude is dead
[7:45:35] <%caramello_man> @justianxix because enemies don't fight literal waves of enemies
[7:45:42] <BillieNoMates> Ahaha
[7:45:47] <BillieNoMates> Rude is the best turk
[7:45:48] <LokimenD> Holy shit we see his eyes
[7:45:49] <gunsrlove> Oh no..they shot da Rude!...it was a total....... SANDSTORM
[7:45:50] <Hydrapissed> hey its O n S
[7:45:52] <availablethor> @noxterminus wait that’s actually a legitimate question
[7:45:54] <BurdRightsActivist> Don't wanna anger the TIME GHOSTS
[7:45:55] <platinumpineapple> thank god the guy who is trying to murder thousands of civilians is fine
[7:46:07] <+Solid_Stro> Always have two pairs
[7:46:08] <sadboy_otoroshi> The tower is going to fall still?
[7:46:14] <+StreamStopA> he does it in the first fight
[7:46:18] <LokimenD> @NoxTerminus Shinra helicopters?
[7:46:23] <metalwater8> He had another pair!!??
[7:46:32] <Daxalog> So the turks are also Mako infused super humans right?
[7:46:38] <+Solid_Stro> Rude always has two pairs
[7:46:46] <LokimenD> No, they just fight good
[7:46:47] <+NoxTerminus> AI focuses whoever you control regardless of the characters own 'will' @PlagueOfGripes
[7:46:47] <%CyberDingus> Summon ?
[7:46:48] <availablethor> Nah, they’re just stronk
[7:46:55] <BurdRightsActivist> NOT CANON
[7:47:02] <LokimenD> But then again neither is Tifa
[7:47:08] <platinumpineapple> maybe he didn't realize he had a crush on her yet
[7:47:13] <availablethor> That’s right
[7:47:35] <availablethor> And Sid is supposedly even less of a superhuman than Tifa
[7:47:36] <hcsarg1986> Rude' probably don't cause as much damage to Tifa as the others
[7:47:40] <+peri_d0t> plague this is gonna sound dumb but are you having fun?
[7:47:53] <LokimenD> I guess it runs on shonen rules where some people are just naturally super strong
[7:47:53] <Sokumotanaka> How "Rude" of you HA HA'
[7:47:56] <sosandstorm> bitch
[7:48:05] <MilkingEdge> NOTHING PERSONAL, BITCH
[7:48:11] <BillieNoMates> TIME GHOST
[7:48:12] <sadboy_otoroshi> ooooo goood
[7:48:16] <BurdRightsActivist> TIME GHOSTS TIME GHOSTS
[7:48:17] <KaiserMario> Here comes the ghost to save the canon!
[7:48:19] <$Rivalshotzgp> The time ghosts will hit the button
[7:48:23] <ahaegotrigger> why is that sword flared like that anyways
[7:48:25] <$Rivalshotzgp> To preserve the canon
[7:48:29] <%JailShmixRemix> LMFAO
[7:48:30] <examplez0> Wasn't it just a regular old time bomb in the original?
[7:48:30] <+Solid_Stro> Reno truly is a fuck boy, very accurate.
[7:48:37] <+NoxTerminus> why are the ghosts even in this game?
[7:48:43] <+peri_d0t> are the ghosts a metaphor for the fans of ff7?
[7:48:47] <%JailShmixRemix> Because its not a good game...
[7:48:48] <Explodincatz> yes
[7:48:49] <%caramello_man> why? this is so heavy-handed
[7:48:56] <gunsrlove> The Nomura Dementors
[7:48:57] <LokimenD> HISTORY ABHORS A PARADOX
[7:48:59] <examplez0> Because it's 2deep4u
[7:49:02] <BurdRightsActivist> @NoxTerminus Genius Nonumbo. It's a remake, but it's not the same as the original. WOW SO META!
[7:49:07] <Zulrez> it was quite nice is that during the cut scene before the fight starts you can hold square to open the menu and set up your team (meaning barret). whats not so nice is that the button is barely even visible and the game never tells you about it.
[7:49:08] <MilkingEdge> NOMURA GHOST
[7:49:08] <Sokumotanaka> TIME GHOST!
[7:49:11] <kiwicoffin> They're the ghosts of FF7 purists
[7:49:13] <platinumpineapple> aren't the y a metaphor for the people who wanted a faithful remake?
[7:49:14] <mapimb> FAAAATE
[7:49:14] <Eger007> fanbase
[7:49:17] <LokimenD> LUL
[7:49:18] <BurdRightsActivist> DOOOONNNNNEEE
[7:49:19] <MilkingEdge> WHAT HAVE YOU DONEEEEEEEEEEEEEE
[7:49:20] <Admiral_PopnFresh> nice reading
[7:49:22] <+NoxTerminus> Is Nomura directing this?...
[7:49:25] <examplez0> They're a metaphor for Nomura-sama's genius intellect
[7:49:26] <@dcn2049> win the battle, lose the cutscene
[7:49:29] <+StreamStopA> The ghosts of lazy writers
[7:49:31] <+peri_d0t> dat doesnt make sense
[7:49:31] <availablethor> The fans
[7:49:32] <kiwicoffin> It's some galaxy brain writing
[7:49:34] <LokimenD> And kinda bad at their job
[7:49:35] <+Solid_Stro> Those hooded things in the Temple of the Ancients?
[7:49:36] <BurdRightsActivist> BRUH YOU HAVE NO IDEA
[7:49:38] <sadboy_otoroshi> the ghosts are real? are just cluds illusions?
[7:49:43] <Hydrapissed> confusing part inc
[7:49:43] <Vaiire> The time ghosts are clearly a metaphor for Square CEOs who want Nomura to stick to the story.
[7:49:49] <%JailShmixRemix> The ghosts are a representation of plague's gripes
[7:49:55] <Hydrapissed> and its fine
[7:50:03] <%CyberDingus> this is bullshit desu
[7:50:03] <MilkingEdge> TOP QUALITY VOICE ACTING
[7:50:04] <sadboy_otoroshi> Fuck that
[7:50:06] <Hydrapissed> bullet proof pc?
[7:50:19] <+HawkGoggles2> The ghosts are the fans. *wank* *wank* Kappa
[7:50:20] <Sokumotanaka> slap her
[7:50:21] <BurdRightsActivist> SLAP HER
[7:50:24] <Hydrapissed> why would this control panel even be able to do this?
[7:50:30] <Sokumotanaka> booooo
[7:50:30] <+spacehouse> BOO
[7:50:31] <platinumpineapple> time ghost should have backhanded her for him to preserve canon
[7:50:32] <examplez0> Exactly
[7:50:33] <Sokumotanaka> NOT CANON
[7:50:34] <BurdRightsActivist> C O W A R D - W R I T E R S
[7:50:35] <BillieNoMates> Why arent the time ghosts making him backhand her?
[7:50:35] <+NoxTerminus> 'the ancient'?
[7:50:37] <LokimenD> Tseng is a good boy. Mass murdering aside
[7:50:40] <+NoxTerminus> what
[7:50:40] <BillieNoMates> Fucking time jannies
[7:50:41] <examplez0> In the original it was literally just a bomb
[7:50:48] <BurdRightsActivist> Where's the time ghosts here? Why ain't they forcing him to slap HER
[7:50:49] <+NoxTerminus> Contrived bullshit
[7:50:54] <Hydrapissed> also yah back hand her
[7:50:56] <Sokumotanaka> Nomura ghost will slap her
[7:50:56] <Flamethrowerman09> SJW's would be crying about it for years
[7:50:59] <Huntercd> Is Tseng Indian or his that just a black head?
[7:51:09] <sadboy_otoroshi> Why they need Aerith again?
[7:51:10] <Sokumotanaka> LUL
[7:51:11] <+stephane3012> messy eater
[7:51:12] <%JailShmixRemix> Its a beauty mark
[7:51:14] <+NoxTerminus> Its leftover chili @Huntercd
[7:51:18] <+Solid_Stro> Don’t tell him
[7:51:18] <+NoxTerminus> he's saving it for later
[7:51:21] <+spacehouse> som1 should edit that scene with a time ghost flying into his hand to backhand Aerith
[7:51:24] <gunsrlove> Tseng is an Indian deity looking guy, but with a Chinese name
[7:51:24] <lulanie> thing is even if they take her she has to be willing.
[7:51:27] <BurdRightsActivist> @Flamethrowerman09 On no the ESSJAYDABEWUS D:
[7:51:30] <platinumpineapple> I'm surprised they didn't expand the time limit to 20 minutes
[7:51:33] <Sokumotanaka> @NoxTerminus LUL
[7:51:33] <Hydrapissed> LOL
[7:51:40] <availablethor> That is correct. Nomura wants a different story but the fans don’t let him. At the end the characters defeat the fans so the story can be different. It’s the opposite of Nier Automata where you defeat the developers to get a good ending.
[7:51:42] <Hydrapissed> a time ghost should back hand aerith yah
[7:52:11] <BurdRightsActivist> The time ghost grows a hand only for this one scene in order to slap Sean Bean
[7:52:16] <%JailShmixRemix> @availablethor that better not be true hggLul
[7:52:17] <+peri_d0t> yeah i never got that
[7:52:18] <Sokumotanaka> @availablethor Christ nomura really.?....
[7:52:25] <sosandstorm> It's big though...
[7:52:26] <+justianxix> oh wait
[7:52:30] <+stephane3012> lol
[7:52:31] <gunsrlove> and that pillar has a SELF DESTRUCT BUTTON
[7:52:31] <Djinnazz> there were
[7:52:32] <+NoxTerminus> the shockwave from this plate falling is likely to level buildings several blocks away from the impact zone.
[7:52:34] <+MrWrann> Wait that rope would drop as soon as the support blew up
[7:52:36] <medril07> bad ghosts
[7:52:39] <BillieNoMates> YOU CANT EAT THIS CAT, WEDGE
[7:52:39] <+thefakeh> F
[7:52:40] <Admiral_PopnFresh> Bye Wedge
[7:52:40] <+HawkGoggles2> Wedge, you stay here and die.
[7:52:40] <%JailShmixRemix> Poor wedge
[7:52:41] <+identitydisc> So @plagueofgripes doesn’t like the game I take it?
[7:52:43] <Explodincatz> f
[7:52:44] <Daxalog> Wow. Killed by time ghosts
[7:52:45] <+peri_d0t> WHAT
[7:52:49] <Sokumotanaka> THE CATS! NO
[7:52:49] <BurdRightsActivist> CAITH SITH WHY ARE YOU HERE LOL
[7:52:50] <Hydrapissed> THOUGHT it was mikey
[7:52:51] <GeltonZ> WELL THAT WAS AWKWARD
[7:52:51] <oshkeet41> LOL
[7:52:51] <TalisKanju> Time ghosts trying to stop Wedge from leaving
[7:52:52] <@dcn2049> lol
[7:52:52] <+justianxix> That is so stupid
[7:52:55] <Sokumotanaka> XDDD
[7:52:57] <LokimenD> But why tho
[7:52:58] <sadboy_otoroshi> what why wow
[7:52:59] <examplez0> If all the fan's fault, if only they kept consuming and lapping up all of Nomura's shit like good little slaves
[7:53:00] <+peri_d0t> WHY IS HE THERE
[7:53:00] <Sol_Install> I thought that was King Mickey
[7:53:00] <%caramello_man> none of the closest slums would survive either; 5, 6 8 & 1 would be fucked
[7:53:02] <Admiral_PopnFresh> It feels like a Shadow the Hedgehog cutscene
[7:53:03] <GeltonZ> THE IBLIS TRIGGER!
[7:53:04] <lulanie> foreshadowing
[7:53:05] <+justianxix> Why not just show Reeves
[7:53:10] <MilkingEdge> CAIT THE HEDGEHOG
[7:53:10] <Flamethrowerman09> Isn't Cait Sith a robot
[7:53:10] <medril07> you won't meet him til next game
[7:53:12] <platinumpineapple> but why did he have to act through his robotic fursuit?
[7:53:14] <+LordSDB> So wedge is also killed by time ghost
[7:53:14] <BurdRightsActivist> BANG BANG BANG PULL MY IBLIS TRIGGER
[7:53:15] <Hydrapissed> I mean didnt he see it
[7:53:15] <Vaiire> It's also incredibly dumb for it to be Cait.
[7:53:16] <wotebi> he never shows up again
[7:53:16] <Admiral_PopnFresh> @GeltonZ Hah
[7:53:23] <Tikigod784> Denzel lived above sector 7
[7:53:26] <Sokumotanaka> Cait sith: YOU BLEW IT UP, DAMN YOU, DANM YOU ALL TO HELL
[7:53:26] <+MrWrann> How did they slow down the zipline?
[7:53:28] <+spacehouse> FF7 Machinabridged is looking better every second
[7:53:34] <Flamethrowerman09> Cait Sith isn't even suppose to be deployed by this point
[7:53:36] <MilkingEdge> WHAT HAVE YOU DONEEEEEEEEEEEEEE
[7:53:39] <BurdRightsActivist> Silence, Plague. It's clear you don't understand GENIUS NONUMBO
[7:53:41] <%JailShmixRemix> What do you mean he's bad? He's a genius
[7:53:46] <availablethor> That was a horrible cameo.
[7:53:56] <examplez0> If only the fans could recognize Nomura's genius intellect and masterful writing ability then he wouldn't need to take a steaming meteor sized dump all over the game
[7:53:57] <GiygasDrillBreak> they have to pack every cutscene because they only have an abundance of artists and not enough programmers
[7:53:58] <LokimenD> Why not just have the guy controlling Cait Sith on a cutscene as foreshadowing?
[7:54:01] <platinumpineapple> just shut your brain off and consume product and get excited for next product
[7:54:02] <Flamethrowerman09> There is not sense of tragedy to this version.
[7:54:06] <GeltonZ> Man I can't wait for that one Kingdom Hearts shit poster guy to do a video on this.
[7:54:10] <examplez0> It's all the fans' fault I swear
[7:54:12] <Sokumotanaka> Yeah no one is gonna understand why or who cait is at that point
[7:54:12] <Tikigod784> All except for Denzel
[7:54:13] <khotgor> This is what happens when you allow a terrible developer to continue to make games
[7:54:22] <availablethor> You can’t introduce a gag character like fair sith like that.... it’s like dramatic whiplash
[7:54:23] <Kidbizzaro> Cloud just vapidly stares on, as he always has
[7:54:27] <BurdRightsActivist> @GeltonZ Just a pancake PogChamp
[7:54:33] <oshkeet41> like, holding off a character death for a game or two fine, not for 10 minutes tho
[7:54:36] <ralanost> Chapter 13?! And still in Midgard? This is more stretched than the Hobbit trilogy.
[7:54:37] <+NoxTerminus> No connection to the people really, seeing the whole place go up is basically pointless
[7:54:40] <lulanie> this is a remake not a remaster. so its going to be different
[7:54:40] <Tikigod784> LUL LUL
[7:54:49] <Sokumotanaka> And they wanna remake ff6 and 9 the best ones? NO!
[7:54:50] <PurestKanadaJin> I hope Chadley died
[7:54:50] <GeltonZ> @BurdRightsActivist YEAH! I can just imagine the "NO! Stop! Nomura! What are you doing!" robot voice.
[7:54:51] <TheWe4pon> remember when you see the news reporter get crushed live on TV?
[7:54:51] <hcsarg1986> I'm pretty some people died in the remake
[7:54:56] <sadboy_otoroshi> Shira is just genocidal just because he can, does he have any motives, did he in the original?
[7:55:04] <+NoxTerminus> this isnt a remaster or a remake, its a rebastard. I didnt even like the original lobosLULN
[7:55:06] <khotgor> If they remake FF6, they will base it off of the IOS/Phone version
[7:55:11] <+justianxix> The upper plate people definately died
[7:55:11] <%JailShmixRemix> @lulanie yeah it's different, but bad hggLul
[7:55:18] <@dcn2049> Chadley is not dead
[7:55:19] <MilkingEdge> CHADLEY NEVER DIES
[7:55:23] <Tikigod784> Kappa
[7:55:23] <%JailShmixRemix> ;
[7:55:25] <seth45er> VIRGIN CHADLEY
[7:55:26] <Hydrapissed> Re(make)
[7:55:27] <MilkingEdge> MARLENEEEEEEEEEE
[7:55:29] <KaiserMario> @PlagueOfGripes Is he now...?
[7:55:31] <examplez0> You Can (Not) Remake
[7:55:31] <+HawkGoggles2> You know Chadley isn't dead. Don't yourself false hope.
[7:55:32] <+XxBTExX> im more sad about the cats than Wedge
[7:55:33] <Flamethrowerman09> This is a demake
[7:55:33] <+NoxTerminus> You mean Final Fantasy 7 Colonoscopy
[7:55:35] <LokimenD> MENDOSAAAAAAAA
[7:55:38] <Kidbizzaro> Wait what?
[7:55:47] <SuperVaderMan> We already saw that they got out, this means nothing
[7:55:53] <+StreamStopA> Thank God you got the train ghosts out first
[7:55:59] <Sokumotanaka> @khotgor I dont want them to that's the guy who made ff13 so I dont trust them not to turn terra into a dress up doll
[7:56:00] <examplez0> Oh no hungry fatass died
[7:56:02] <sadboy_otoroshi> Denial, Anger, Grief,
[7:56:05] <Zinax7> he wanted to feel that pain
[7:56:09] <Daxalog> Final Fantasy 7: We can (Re)Do it (Dont)
[7:56:10] <examplez0> I sure will miss the way he was fat and hungry 24/7
[7:56:11] <LokimenD> Aw, I'm more sad for Barret than the actual tragedy
[7:56:13] <platinumpineapple> he used both in the original, I distinctly remember the thud clank thud clank
[7:56:14] <availablethor> @sadboy_otoroshi They don’t care because they want to build a new city anyway
[7:56:14] <Tikigod784> i mean, if they didn't kill horse ghost, all those people would be ghosts now
[7:56:17] <+peri_d0t> WHAT
[7:56:18] <Tikigod784> and we can't have that
[7:56:19] <+NoxTerminus> Wrong
[7:56:20] <medril07> I hope you will help me to make new materia
[7:56:21] <ahaegotrigger> LUL
[7:56:22] <+justianxix> Tifa...
[7:56:23] <%JailShmixRemix> lol
[7:56:24] <sosandstorm> WHAT
[7:56:24] <+LordSDB> Tifa wtf
[7:56:24] <BurdRightsActivist> @GeltonZ "Nomura. We just need you to remake ff7. But don't make it compicated" "Okay"
[7:56:24] <Sokumotanaka> Cait without the moogle
[7:56:30] <@dcn2049> god damn tifa
[7:56:34] <gunsrlove> WRITING
[7:56:35] <+NoxTerminus> 'Were responsible for this thing we were actively trying to stop'
[7:56:37] <sosandstorm> "You fucked up barrett"
[7:56:39] <platinumpineapple> that sector owed cloud a pizza...
[7:56:42] <+peri_d0t> TIFA THATS NOT THE PLAY
[7:56:42] <mapimb> what did she say
[7:56:45] <%caramello_man> is this the end?
[7:56:48] <@dcn2049> victim blaming shit
[7:56:52] <%JailShmixRemix> no
[7:56:53] <mapimb> I missed it
[7:56:55] <Sol_Install> tifa that made zero sense
[7:56:58] <GeltonZ> @BurdRightsActivist "I am going to remake Final Fantasy 7 and not fuck it up!" "Okay I believe you!"
[7:56:59] <TeethandHunger> I'm angry that time ghosts killed jessie, wedge, and biggs. Not because they where trying to save people from being crushed.
[7:56:59] <Daxalog> I wish I had gloves like that
[7:57:01] <Hydrapissed> hes HUGE
[7:57:01] <Sokumotanaka> Dude if Weege died okay fine but the CATS THO!?
[7:57:02] <Tikigod784> maybe the real pizza was the friends crushed by midgar along the way
[7:57:04] <ralanost> Love showing off those weapons and materia
[7:57:04] <gunsrlove> Steroids
[7:57:07] <lulanie> is that a problem?
[7:57:07] <LokimenD> Jesus Barret monkaS
[7:57:08] <+NoxTerminus> He just punched the wall, its swollen Kappa
[7:57:09] <KaiserMario> USE IT
[7:57:16] <examplez0> Nomura: "how kinda remake you want" Square : "Just fuck my shit up"
[7:57:19] <+StreamStopA> Yes let the hate flow through you
[7:57:21] <GiygasDrillBreak> lol Unreal Engine geometry
[7:57:22] <Huntercd> Or she'just tiny?
[7:57:25] <sadboy_otoroshi> his hand can fit a head on the palm
[7:57:28] <Hydrapissed> ima merc wheres my money
[7:57:31] <%caramello_man> pay me
[7:57:32] <hcsarg1986> @Sol_Install To be fair she said something similar in the original
[7:57:37] <+NoxTerminus> To be honest the only Square title I've enjoyed in the last 5 years has been FF14
[7:57:38] <medril07> so, about my money...
[7:57:40] <Sokumotanaka> Wow tifa and barret seem more like friends in this version at least
[7:57:41] <Huntercd> Cloud get in there
[7:57:42] <Sol_Install> It still makes zero sense
[7:57:44] <+NoxTerminus> theyve ruined Front Mission
[7:57:46] <platinumpineapple> aerif
[7:57:48] <xemeas> Let the nomura flow through youuuuuuu
[7:57:49] <+NoxTerminus> now theyre derping up FF7
[7:57:50] <sosandstorm> also i think you guys owe me a pizza now
[7:57:50] <Explodincatz> its a good thing I never was interested in this game or I would probly be pissed
[7:57:55] <cyberblueneon> they already said that in the tv broadcast
[7:58:02] <MilkingEdge> Cloud payed with all that exposure
[7:58:09] <khotgor> Man, Mr. T looks naked without his chains
[7:58:12] <Kidbizzaro> "I got another gig as a zombie marine in Doom, and the next protag in Gears of War"
[7:58:28] <+peri_d0t> the musics good tho
[7:58:29] <Daxalog> So is biggs and wedge actually dead now?
[7:58:30] <hcsarg1986> Why would Tseng slap Aerith if he likes her though?
[7:58:33] <+HawkGoggles2> Words of hope.
[7:58:34] <sadboy_otoroshi> @khotgor I cannot unsee it now.
[7:58:41] <GiygasDrillBreak> I thought Front Mission Evolved was bad, then Left Alive happened
[7:58:44] <oshkeet41> Barret's less Mr T than the guy from Predator and every other tough middle aged black dude from scifi westaboos watched dubbed
[7:58:45] <+justianxix> stopping on the big sad?
[7:58:48] <Sokumotanaka> I can't watif for cait to stab reno later
[7:58:50] <+peri_d0t> barrets last name is wallace?
[7:58:51] <JohnClaggart> how is this not over yet?
[7:58:51] <mapimb> lets stop now plague
[7:58:56] <+stephentoostronk> but the scruffy neck beard
[7:58:58] <Sol_Install> yea let's stop
[7:59:12] <khotgor> A landmine field of cutscenes
[7:59:13] <GiygasDrillBreak> woolie described barret best, barret is like a black israelite on a street corner
[7:59:20] <MilkingEdge> !uptime
[7:59:20] <@Nightbot> 7 hours 59 minutes 30 seconds
[7:59:27] <examplez0> DAS RIGHT
[7:59:39] <oshkeet41> Barrets an anhk bro
[7:59:41] <sadboy_otoroshi> Is like a horror movie, jumpscares are cutscenes.
[7:59:42] <%JailShmixRemix> Middler Manager-kun
[7:59:47] <availablethor> Yeah I think the Marlene thing is better written here. Shinea NEEDS Aerith to agree, they can’t take her by force, blackmail tho
[7:59:55] <%caramello_man> all these people should be dead! a plate fucking droopped just next door
[8:00:00] <Sokumotanaka> Chadley will literally show up at plague's house
[8:00:03] <+HawkGoggles2> Renud.
[8:00:09] <oshkeet41> i kinda hope manager has a change of heart and ends up as one of those exgoons on the highwind
[8:00:11] <gunsrlove> Why do the NPC have a different art style from the MC's , it bugs me a lot
[8:00:18] <examplez0> Sp did Shinra take Marlene to Aerith's house?
[8:00:25] <GiygasDrillBreak> they shouldnt even be breathing well, there would be too much dust in the air
[8:00:26] <examplez0> This makes way less sense than the original
[8:00:29] <Explodincatz> LUL
[8:00:31] <+justianxix> Pat yourself's on the back
[8:00:41] <availablethor> I think that is implied, yes. They had a copter after all
[8:00:50] <+MrWrann> So if they never attacked the tower Shinra would have just blown up their own tower and then what? Blame it on people who were never there
[8:00:51] <Daxalog> Stamp denies this ever happened.
[8:00:52] <oshkeet41> only thing that got stamped was the slums
[8:00:55] <Sokumotanaka> !!!
[8:00:58] <Sokumotanaka> I SAW THAT
[8:01:11] <medril07> whoa
[8:01:12] <Sokumotanaka> Barret is a ghost too
[8:01:13] <khotgor> Why the fuck would cloud know
[8:01:17] <+StreamStopA> barret walking though Tifa
[8:01:18] <%JailShmixRemix> lol
[8:01:18] <BurdRightsActivist> dramatic zoom sound 4Head
[8:01:19] <Explodincatz> u would
[8:01:29] <examplez0> The people wouldn't know that AVALANCHE weren't there since they still didn't know who AVALANCHE are
[8:01:34] <sadboy_otoroshi> What is not a ghost by now.
[8:01:41] <platinumpineapple> oh everyone knows about ancients now?
[8:01:47] <%JailShmixRemix> SEPHY
[8:01:56] <Sokumotanaka> Oh he's back
[8:01:58] <mapimb> seth roegan
[8:01:59] <+XxBTExX> bishie boy is back
[8:02:01] <examplez0> To be fair this scene does actually happen in the original
[8:02:04] <gunsrlove> Supple lips
[8:02:09] <medril07> howdy cloud
[8:02:12] <examplez0> Though it's presented as white text on a black background
[8:02:13] <khotgor> sexy cat eyes
[8:02:15] <GeltonZ> @platinumpineapple Nah they don't yet. It's...convoluted and stupid.
[8:02:22] <kiwicoffin> Remember Sephy is the real bad guy even if he didn't have anything to do with this
[8:02:23] <+XxBTExX> Rawr, sexy bad boi
[8:02:23] <GiygasDrillBreak> It's 4PM Cloud, time for your dick flattening
[8:02:24] <Tikigod784> D A R K N E S S
[8:02:24] <LokimenD> Da da da nananana SEPHIROTH
[8:02:25] <hcsarg1986> Japanese gasp
[8:02:26] <gnollAUS> Why do they keep building him up
[8:02:26] <lulanie> ptsd
[8:02:29] <+Baresenio> I mean he IS a druggy
[8:02:33] <gnollAUS> Like we don't need it
[8:02:33] <Huntercd> Who wrote this?
[8:02:34] <Wanky_Woop> Kiss, kiss, kiss!
[8:02:35] <+HawkGoggles2> Remember in the original when Seph wasn't even show until you left Midgar.
[8:02:38] <Sokumotanaka> Stop making me question my straightness SwiftRage
[8:02:40] <+peri_d0t> those pores
[8:02:44] <Wanky_Woop> aw
[8:02:45] <sadboy_otoroshi> Let him bang the wall, or kill tifa who cares.
[8:02:48] <+justianxix> I want to see more of that Tifa shit seeing Cloud being crazy
[8:02:49] <LokimenD> I do like Cloud freaking out just by seeing the guy
[8:02:51] <BurdRightsActivist> Isn't sephiroth just supposed to be a crazed puppet of Jenova? Since when did he become this super powerful anime puppet, lol?
[8:02:53] <hcsarg1986> Darth Sephiroth
[8:02:56] <BurdRightsActivist> anime character*
[8:02:57] <Hydrapissed> I think hes around in midgar
[8:02:58] <SuperVaderMan> Don't worry about me, just seeing ghosts again
[8:03:01] <+XxBTExX> how much of manlet is cloud? Isnt Sephiroth like 6ft? How tall is Cloud? 5'1" ?
[8:03:05] <platinumpineapple> the pores on sephiroth's face symbolize the crater meteor is gonna leave
[8:03:10] <examplez0> More like Jenova is a puppet of Sephiroth
[8:03:16] <+HawkGoggles2> All of the ghost combine into Seph for the final fight.
[8:03:19] <@dcn2049> Yeah, building up the FINAL BOSS is such a dumb and unheard of idea
[8:03:20] <Huntercd> Why tho?
[8:03:20] <availablethor> Real Sephiroth is, but this is just Clouds crazy imaginations
[8:03:22] <Tikigod784> Sephiroth is 7ft tall and his sword is 3 miles long
[8:03:26] <@Nightbot> @KaiserMario -> Hey, chill out! [stop spamming symbols] [warning]
[8:03:35] <oshkeet41> OG SEph was kinda ambigious who was in control. post-EU tho theyve been building him up as some badass totally in control all along. eh.
[8:03:36] <GiygasDrillBreak> Sephiroth is tall, more than 6'3", Cloud is only 5'7"
[8:03:40] <gunsrlove> Sephiroth is a Washing Pole scrub
[8:03:49] <LokimenD> @BurdRightsActivist ehhhh, the whole Jenova and Sephiroth relationship is complicated. Also because he's the more famous villain
[8:03:58] <+XxBTExX> Spehiroth looks tall as hell compared to cloud.
[8:04:03] <GiygasDrillBreak> all JRPG protagonists are 5'7", that's the law in japan
[8:04:09] <Zinax7> they did such a good job with this game and had the full flow and the feeling that you're satisfied (says one big twitch streamer)
[8:04:11] <Sokumotanaka> Barret is fast
[8:04:11] <Zinax7> lel
[8:04:20] <Daxalog> Whats the hiring process to join SOLDIER? The Benefits seem way to substantial to refuse.
[8:04:31] <Huntercd> But he didn't show up until the very end of disc one
[8:04:32] <Sokumotanaka> Assume the position lady
[8:04:34] <SuperVaderMan> nyoom
[8:04:43] <%caramello_man> why is everyone so chill about this? you should be losing your shit!
[8:04:43] <Tikigod784> The benefits for SOLDIER are nice but the retirement package sucks
[8:04:47] <platinumpineapple> badger and skinny pete are done for
[8:04:49] <Hydrapissed> the cats shielded him
[8:04:54] <LokimenD> @Huntercd That's how famous he got
[8:04:56] <Sokumotanaka> Those poor cats TwT
[8:04:59] <TalisKanju> And his Time Ghosts
[8:04:59] <+LordSDB> He was surrounded by ghosts
[8:05:00] <+justianxix> The ghosts were fucking with him tho
[8:05:05] <Hydrapissed> OH hes GRAPPLE hook that saved hi,m
[8:05:07] <+StreamStopA> Wedge dead as hell
[8:05:09] <Daxalog> Cat Wrangle Materia
[8:05:12] <Explodincatz> his fat adsorbed the dmg
[8:05:12] <Hydrapissed> jesus its glowing
[8:05:15] <Huntercd> That's dumb
[8:05:16] <sosandstorm> what the FUCK does that mean jackass?
[8:05:20] <TeethandHunger> Its scared
[8:05:25] <Tikigod784> chocobos are owned by disney, and so they are perpetually colorful
[8:05:25] <+peri_d0t> maybe is on purpose
[8:05:26] <gnollAUS> To bright
[8:05:28] <sosandstorm> don't be scared, everyone is scared
[8:05:34] <Sokumotanaka> the other what?
[8:05:37] <medril07> pay me
[8:05:38] <sosuke5> pay me
[8:05:40] <Huntercd> Do chickens feel fear?
[8:05:46] <Hydrapissed> pay me
[8:05:47] <Tikigod784> because kingdom hearts has infected this whole game
[8:05:53] <gunsrlove> ....who? Just tell him they died
[8:05:59] <khotgor> I can't wait until goofy shows up
[8:06:02] <%JailShmixRemix> I guess he means find their bodies?
[8:06:13] <availablethor> I’ll say something controversial I think only the ghosts and the ending of this game are bad, everything else is an improvement. Even these Sephiroth scenes would be fine if it’s just Cloud’s craziness
[8:06:16] <BurdRightsActivist> Cocks don't feel fear, you stupid
[8:06:18] <+XxBTExX> Hallways
[8:06:20] <Sokumotanaka> I can't wait until Sonic the hedgehog shows up
[8:06:37] <Hydrapissed> nah make MORE PLATES
[8:06:42] <examplez0> I always thought Zack looked like Sonic in the original game
[8:06:50] <BillieNoMates> neo midgard isnt elevated :)
[8:06:50] <Tikigod784> they do go into midgar being a mistake later i think
[8:06:52] <Huntercd> Reeve sucks at his job
[8:06:53] <%JailShmixRemix> The combat is not an improvement :v
[8:06:53] <oshkeet41> how you gonna have a heavy handed metaphor without heavy plates
[8:06:54] <Daxalog> More plates but make it like a mushroom
[8:06:56] <platinumpineapple> @availablethor that's what's frustrating, the remake does some things incredibly right but then brings them down with vapid writing decisions
[8:06:57] <kiwicoffin> OR we put plates above the other plates
[8:06:59] <hcsarg1986> But Shinra stupid though
[8:06:59] <sosandstorm> and what? spend the money to improve the infrastructure for the poors? you're crazy
[8:06:59] <GeltonZ> @availablethor Not that controversial. There's a LOT of cool things in this game! It's hella impressive! Just...some things are...misguided.
[8:07:02] <Hydrapissed> inc cutscene
[8:07:02] <+justianxix> Maybe, don't think the original never got into that
[8:07:05] <+XxBTExX> City planning is not doing its job properly
[8:07:06] <Explodincatz> we will rebuild the plates and then LAYER them
[8:07:14] <BurdRightsActivist> GET CUTSCENED NERD
[8:07:20] <availablethor> @platinumpineapple yeah exactly
[8:07:23] <Tikigod784> a lot of this game seems to be trying to flesh out shinra or something
[8:07:23] <Sol_Install> I disagree, there's a lot of patting for the sake of development of a character more than building the character with story tbh
[8:07:23] <sadboy_otoroshi> You need that bladerunner hivecity cyberpunk aesthetic.
[8:07:26] <%JailShmixRemix> The character dialogue in this game is great, the gameplay is fine
[8:07:31] <examplez0> Nomura getting the cutscene hammer ready
[8:07:37] <%JailShmixRemix> The story.... well we'll see
[8:07:41] <cyberblueneon> the main problem with this game is that over half of it is filler, if it was paced like the original i wouldnt even mind the dumb story changes that much
[8:07:53] <Explodincatz> so far this story is garbage
[8:07:55] <TeethandHunger> I think the time ghosts are the ghosts of the people that died in the original game making sure that they die in this game too.
[8:07:56] <MilkingEdge> MARLENEEEEEEEEEEEEE
[8:07:56] <+XxBTExX> Bald men deserve to be fought
[8:07:58] <Hydrapissed> magic disney house
[8:08:00] <Tikigod784> if this was the whole game no one would care about the padding
[8:08:01] <sosandstorm> a secret fucking vila what the hell
[8:08:02] <BurdRightsActivist> Side Missions probably
[8:08:05] <Hydrapissed> HOW are bandits not ALL OVER this house
[8:08:09] <medril07> fresh water
[8:08:10] <platinumpineapple> the witch from berserk lives here
[8:08:10] <+HawkGoggles2> Clean water.
[8:08:15] <khotgor> Time Ghosts seem fucking stupid
[8:08:20] <Zinax7> oh shit a burglar
[8:08:20] <+justianxix> Much of that filter had a bunch of character development though
[8:08:22] <+XxBTExX> Fucking hobbits live there
[8:08:25] <kiwicoffin> The rest of the peasants have to live on top of each other
[8:08:28] <sosuke5> Ah! A black man!
[8:08:34] <oshkeet41> Id mind the time ghost stuff less if they set any explination or expectation of them
[8:08:36] <Sol_Install> The time ghost get more stupid If you think about the ending
[8:08:36] <gunsrlove> Why is this giant black man running into my house!?!?!?
[8:08:44] <oshkeet41> besides 'gues you gotta wait till the end, nerds'
[8:08:44] <Hydrapissed> with a gun
[8:08:59] <MilkingEdge> BIG BLACK SCARING THE LOCALS
[8:09:04] <sosandstorm> why would she make him do that song and dance when she knows her name
[8:09:06] <%caramello_man> he's black! uh- I mean he's got a gun!
[8:09:06] <LokimenD> Man, Barret is the best
[8:09:07] <availablethor> It’s like Hogwarts if people wander here they just see ruins and suddenly remember that they had something very important to do and leave
[8:09:20] <sosandstorm> He said marlene she should have been like, yeah upstairs sleeping safe and sound
[8:09:24] <+HawkGoggles2> Barret just falls back down the stairs with a dumb smile on his face.
[8:09:27] <Sokumotanaka> Barret is okay
[8:09:30] <$Rivalshotzgp> HOW IS THE CHILD HERE
[8:09:35] <$Rivalshotzgp> SHE WAS KIDNAPPED
[8:09:36] <%CyberDingus> talk with the stern but fari mom
[8:09:37] <Sokumotanaka> Marlene is a good girl
[8:09:42] <GiygasDrillBreak> Marlene pull a knife on someone? like father, like daughter
[8:09:53] <+XxBTExX> Maybe you should go look at the child.
[8:09:53] <platinumpineapple> just watch her sleep like a normal person
[8:09:54] <sadboy_otoroshi> Why did they need aerith?
[8:10:00] <sosandstorm> Hot take, if you're gonna be a terrorist, this is the place to do it
[8:10:03] <Explodincatz> no one took their choes off
[8:10:21] <Tikigod784> Midgar is "MERICA. No shoe nonsense
[8:10:23] <hcsarg1986> @Rivalshotzgp Shinra let her go That was part of the deal
[8:10:23] <SuperVaderMan> I guess the helicopter dropped Marlene off in their helicopter LUL
[8:10:27] <+XxBTExX> So did they not hear about the fucking plate falling
[8:10:28] <%JailShmixRemix> very very hot
[8:10:30] <TalisKanju> Marlene has no use to the Shinra since they have Aerith
[8:10:36] <Hydrapissed> it was super hot
[8:10:36] <%CyberDingus> OH MY
[8:10:42] <Daxalog> back there?
[8:10:43] <Hydrapissed> lets mash muffs
[8:10:52] <+NoxTerminus> Tifa's proportions seem real odd in this game ngl
[8:10:58] <sosandstorm> Hey see that Tifa? how she didn't just set the blame in your lap and tried to calm you? think you coulda done that for Barret?
[8:11:00] <examplez0> Yet they kidnap Marlene anyway
[8:11:00] <kiwicoffin> Get tricked moron
[8:11:11] <MilkingEdge> Detecive Cloud
[8:11:15] <platinumpineapple> "an ancient, like from those planetology books you all read"
[8:12:05] <gunsrlove> 1980's Elmyra
[8:12:08] <gunsrlove> Kappa
[8:12:12] <Sunstalker> But he never came back so I had to do with this table. It used to be a square. danC
[8:12:12] <kiwicoffin> The ol Nomura bait and switch
[8:12:21] <examplez0> Aerith's foster mom has got it going on
[8:12:32] <Sokumotanaka> Elmyra literally gets zero screentime so it makes sense she wouldn't resonate with barret cause she literally wont exist after this scene
[8:12:33] <availablethor> No, this is a good part
[8:12:35] <GiygasDrillBreak> Elmyra has the Sarah Conner thing going on
[8:12:39] <Hydrapissed> milfs galore
[8:12:40] <+NoxTerminus> Isnt that just Aerith's model with more hair?
[8:12:44] <+spacehouse> dying for that SWEET KUSH
[8:12:46] <sadboy_otoroshi> Ancient that are not immortal, whak
[8:12:50] <JohnClaggart> BLURRGGH
[8:12:55] <oshkeet41> sorta a genericpretty goin on
[8:12:56] <Sokumotanaka> @PlagueOfGripes Dont forget the chest in the room btw
[8:12:58] <+XxBTExX> "All women look alike" - Plague 2020
[8:13:02] <Hydrapissed> left the body there
[8:13:05] <SuperVaderMan> everyone looking kinda the same because it's anime
[8:13:05] <Tikigod784> I dunno, Tifa and Aerith look pretty different...
[8:13:11] <+EpicureanIguana> just kill her already ResidentSleeper
[8:13:13] <gunsrlove> That's a different kinda lonely , lady
[8:13:14] <oshkeet41> not their faces tbh
[8:13:17] <Zinax7> we used the mom's dead body as fertilizer
[8:13:26] <@Nightbot> Plague is a youtube animator and also streams at https://picarto.tv/Plague . Also: t-shirts! http://goo.gl/lze8QO
[8:13:26] <GiygasDrillBreak> all women look alike sounds like an art gripe video title
[8:13:29] <%CyberDingus> @PlagueOfGripes nip eyes
[8:13:32] <arkv01> tifa's got the kpop eyes
[8:13:41] <sadboy_otoroshi> planet? wut

[8:13:45] <$Rivalshotzgp> I dislike children
[8:13:45] <Sokumotanaka> The black teacher looks unique
[8:13:45] <Tikigod784> "Eyes". That's what stands out. Uh-huh. Kappa Kappa
[8:13:46] <KawaiiJetty> Barret is the only handsome tbh
[8:13:46] <VeryTricky> Yea

[8:14:28] <arkv01> 6th sense ass kid
[8:14:29] <BTRNDL> somehow the dubbed dialogue is less impactful than the blue textbox to me elaHmm
[8:14:30] <+HawkGoggles2> And then I started to drink.
[8:14:32] <ralanost> Blows my mind that you are this far into the game and still haven't stormed Shinra HQ
[8:14:33] <Alzero83> doodDerp alzeroMateria
[8:14:35] <BurdRightsActivist> FACTS
[8:14:36] <BurdRightsActivist> AND LOGIC
[8:14:41] <@dcn2049> that's not hella creepy at aaaall
[8:14:42] <Borchmoor> Borchmoor subscribed at Tier 1.

[8:14:53] <Alzero83> Like 5
[8:14:58] <oshkeet41> with blue text you can be blind sided by the diaogue
[8:14:58] <GeltonZ> @ralanost That's the end game
[8:15:02] <Alzero83> maybe 9
[8:15:04] <GiygasDrillBreak> it's about 12 years
[8:15:04] <examplez0> And we still have a bunch of shit to do before storming Shinra HQ
[8:15:07] <VeryTricky> What was the war about
[8:15:07] <Sokumotanaka> Elmyra: I didn't believe her, I slapped the black off her
[8:15:08] <Hydrapissed> EVEN now
[8:15:12] <JohnClaggart> war was 15 years ago
[8:15:12] <BillieNoMates> Ahhhhhhhhhhhhhh

[8:15:21] <BillieNoMates> Thats how Elmira paid her rent
[8:15:23] <sosandstorm> @Daxalog probably not as bad as dropping a fucking plate
[8:15:25] <sadboy_otoroshi> Hasn't aged
[8:15:25] <arkv01> tseng was already a big boy when aeris was a child
[8:15:26] <examplez0> Is Tseng a vampire?
[8:15:29] <BillieNoMates> "tseng, you get 20 minutes "
[8:15:29] <+StreamStopA> Is that joe biden?

[8:15:30] <MilkingEdge> Pedo Tsung
[8:15:31] <BurdRightsActivist> LOOKIN LIKE FRESH MEAT
[8:15:33] <examplez0> He hasn't aged a day since then
[8:15:33] <oshkeet41> You never remodel someone in anime unless they'd be under 10
[8:15:33] <@dcn2049> that pedo
[8:15:34] <platinumpineapple> come into my van and I'll show you the promised land

[8:15:43] <Tikigod784> walks in and starts giving exposition
[8:15:48] <Tikigod784> Tseng you nerd
[8:15:48] <peanutdot007> Tseng isn't a vampire, he's just anime
[8:15:51] <GiygasDrillBreak> tseng sounds like a storybook reader
[8:15:56] <TalisKanju> "I was really happy that my adopted daughter told me my husband died"
[8:15:58] <+HawkGoggles2> Is this their first meeting because this dialogue doesn't make sense.
[8:16:00] <kiwicoffin> I wouldnt remember something like this word for word 15 years later
[8:16:04] <arkv01> we getting REAL evangelion up in this btich
[8:16:05] <@dcn2049> woo plot dump
[8:16:11] <oshkeet41> i mean if planetology is a thing, theyd prolly call it 'scrpiture'
[8:16:13] <Huntercd> What?!
[8:16:14] <BurdRightsActivist> THE SACRED TEXTS
[8:16:17] <sadboy_otoroshi> She's a messiah suddenly.
[8:16:18] <Eger007> they were in the original no?
[8:16:20] <Kejang> you're nuts kid
[8:16:22] <arkv01> the dead sea scrolls
[8:16:22] <Sokumotanaka> yeah I'm crazy
[8:16:22] <ralanost> FFVIIR feels like Dirge of Cerebus or Crisis Core with all this crazy expanded story garbage
[8:16:25] <Tikigod784> Shinra is Hitler analogue?
[8:16:25] <BillieNoMates> Shinra just wants new land
[8:16:29] <sosandstorm> naw that's corporate 101
[8:16:29] <GeltonZ> Wait...does this mean BARRET is an ancient? He could hear the planet!
[8:16:31] <+EpicureanIguana> this dota plot is getting very weird
[8:16:32] <+NoxTerminus> whispers? What is this Warhammer 40K? Is Aerith a psyker? lobosLULN
[8:16:43] <Gavaline> Not after finding Jenova and the ruins
[8:16:44] <Liquid_In_Silico> Mad science is the key to all of this
[8:16:44] <GiygasDrillBreak> it's like Raiders of the Lost Ark, gotta find the ark of the covenant for power
[8:16:45] <examplez0> Maybe not AS bad as Dirge of Cerberus
[8:16:45] <Hydrapissed> lol
[8:16:52] <BillieNoMates> "treated like a guest"
[8:16:53] <examplez0> That's a whole new level of terrible
[8:16:56] <Sokumotanaka> Bring back Cissnei!
[8:16:56] <Huntercd> Why is the religion thing not more promenent?
[8:16:58] <arkv01> a doujin guest
[8:16:58] <platinumpineapple> treated like a guest... to crossbreeding experiments
[8:17:00] <availablethor> Eh, Hojo puts the science into it
[8:17:01] <Sol_Install> in a lab... to fuck... a lab rat dog
[8:17:07] <ahaegotrigger> Jesus

[8:17:14] <+justianxix> The ghosts want to watch
[8:17:15] <Hydrapissed> are the ghost gana make red 13 do the deed?
[8:17:15] <Daxalog> Ghost Knot
[8:17:21] <LokimenD> Hojo is on the loose we have to stop him
[8:17:23] <BillieNoMates> We have to be there, with the smart phones we have now
[8:17:25] <Huntercd> Knotty by nature
[8:17:27] <GiygasDrillBreak> japanese writers dont like religion, in case you havent played many JRPGs
[8:17:28] <BurdRightsActivist> I mean, who wouldn't want that?
[8:17:31] <Hydrapissed> THEY gana do it
[8:17:31] <arkv01> the ghosts will encourage red's dick, yes
[8:17:34] <peanutdot007> Maybe Hojo just does that with all his guests.
[8:17:34] <TeethandHunger> A talking dog to be fair
[8:17:34] <Hydrapissed> the ghost ARE the fans
[8:17:41] <examplez0> Maybe she's right the worst they'll do is make her fuck a few dogs and then they'll let her go
[8:17:41] <Tikigod784> let's head back to Sector 7 for SIDEQUESTS
[8:17:43] <Sokumotanaka> STOP IT!
[8:17:43] <ralanost> ghosts fluffing the doggo
[8:17:45] <$jamarartdoodles> Plz! She needs to be knotted lol
[8:17:49] <+r_squared1672> Hey Plague, enjoying the game so far?
[8:17:49] <Daxalog> Animal Husbandry Edition
[8:17:50] <sadboy_otoroshi> why the ghosts don't just move the plot forward.
[8:17:51] <Explodincatz> o look they brought in a ghost dog too
[8:17:54] <kiwicoffin> Japanese writers fucking love norse mythology though
[8:17:55] <+justianxix> Fuck that Girl doggie, you know you want to
[8:17:56] <Hydrapissed> with super great art
[8:17:57] <arkv01> uh what, we can go back to the wrecked slums?
[8:18:03] <platinumpineapple> headcanon is canon too, says the ghost
[8:18:03] <Futurecity10> Dough-jin
[8:18:04] <JohnClaggart> the ghosts have unlimited internet access
[8:18:06] <gnollAUS> Not far enough
[8:18:08] <+XxBTExX> That Hojo + Lucretia NTR doujin
[8:18:09] <%CyberDingus> @PlagueOfGripes go to sleep
[8:18:14] <BurdRightsActivist> D'oh-Djinn
[8:18:14] <Sokumotanaka> I took damage from that
[8:18:17] <hcsarg1986> Do we ever see Elmyra's reaction to Aerith's death in the original?
[8:18:25] <examplez0> I don't think so
[8:18:31] <Futurecity10> No, thats how its pronouced
[8:18:42] <khotgor> Like how the buster sword looks like it has a blood gauge in the center of the blade
[8:18:42] <Huntercd> you tell her in the original
[8:18:46] <MilkingEdge> Now you can get that meteria at the church
[8:18:48] <+XxBTExX> loot the sleeping girl
[8:18:55] <%CyberDingus> giggity
[8:18:58] <BillieNoMates> Plague wants to slot things in barret
[8:19:04] <BillieNoMates> and watch a dog knot Aeris
[8:19:07] <sadboy_otoroshi> @kiwicoffin They get high on how they can word stupid foreign shit with their overly complex moon runes
[8:19:08] <hcsarg1986> @Huntercd What does she say?
[8:19:10] <+XxBTExX> "I want to slot the colored balls into Barret" - Plague 2020
[8:19:11] <Hydrapissed> useful..

[8:19:28] <arkv01> baphomet
[8:19:28] <+Baresenio> Needs more pentagrams
[8:19:36] <%CyberDingus> RIP AND TEAR, CLOUD
[8:19:36] <availablethor> This is not really a criticism of the remake but I don’t understand why they need the mother’s permission to save her. Is this a japanese thing?
[8:19:39] <TeethandHunger> Doom eternal connection confirmed
[8:19:40] <examplez0> Whatever it is you know some basic bitch will get a tattoo of it
[8:19:55] <%JailShmixRemix> me :)
[8:20:02] <arkv01> this place is crazy pretty at night
[8:20:03] <+justianxix> probably a cutscene
[8:20:07] <MilkingEdge> YES
[8:20:10] <Sol_Install> sure
[8:20:10] <ZarodGaming> i would have thought the sword was much bigger
[8:20:11] <%CyberDingus> @PlagueOfGripes please go to bed
[8:20:12] <+XxBTExX> Where is the next cutscene you have to go to?
[8:20:14] <oshkeet41> GOLDEN and SHINY
[8:20:28] <platinumpineapple> oh is there a whole new chapter about going back into sector 7?
[8:20:41] <Huntercd> IIRC its something about how she knew and she was at peace with Aeris's death. @hcsarg1986
[8:20:44] <arkv01> so walmart being in one piece, I assume theres tons of side quests back there now
[8:20:52] <sadboy_otoroshi> Gotta do some fetch quests right.
