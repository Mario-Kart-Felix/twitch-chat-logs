[0:08:54] <%Revan175757> it's stupid, so it's great
[0:08:57] <SirGO0SE> i always think of a swarm of bitching locusts whenever i hear "plague of gripes"

[0:15:23] <Mizaiya> dont say it
[0:15:45] <+silvery_cricket> I think it would be wise to cut off this anime boys arms and legs
[0:15:48] <+silvery_cricket> but not kill him
[0:16:05] <+silvery_cricket> as he appears to exist for no other reason than making life harder
[0:16:22] <Johnmaddened> it's like poetry, it rhymes
[0:16:29] <+sonofthedeepsouth> i fucking hate twitch ads dawg
[0:16:33] <LunarRemix> Both games(?)
[0:16:53] <+sonofthedeepsouth> they take way too long and pay very little for the streamers
[0:17:26] <+sonofthedeepsouth> Yup
[0:17:37] <+sonofthedeepsouth> Always get those
[0:17:41] <%Revan175757> i dont get them for some reason
[0:17:42] <filthywanko> that explains the ad I got before checking to see if its still on
[0:17:55] <%Revan175757> maybe cause Russia
[0:18:07] <cap_bon> 30 second ads everytime you open a stream really kills trying to find new streamers to watch
[0:18:16] <morcego_cinzento_arts> Plague described my feelings getting into the stream Just now and hit with a 2 min ad
[0:18:26] <+Axellogic> Ads are just there to stimulate our creativity
[0:18:34] <+Axellogic> Really its  a favor to us
[0:18:40] <+sonofthedeepsouth> Hmmmm
[0:19:11] <morcego_cinzento_arts> all ass stimulate in me is a murder boner

[0:25:17] <fillmydarksoulwithlight> imagine being unique and being stuck in this fucking game series. being normal kinda good
[0:25:46] <%cosmicleviathan18> maybe that's his talent, being the most generic person in the world
[0:25:50] <%Revan175757> so fuck copywright shit, twitch, youtube, it'ts all lies
[0:26:00] <Nelsukako> everything should be public domain when enough time has pass
[0:26:06] <+legioned247> weird

[0:26:07] <rdddy> @PlagueOfGripes did that one movie atleast dodge racism? that one on the island with the black guy in the beginning
[0:26:07] <+sonofthedeepsouth> Cinema greatest contribution to the world was the Wilhelm Scream.

[0:30:51] <Nelsukako> @sonofthedeepsouth the first one has some good dialogues tho. The rest, not so much...
[0:30:52] <rdddy> can we make this guy go back to playing russian roulette?
[0:30:54] <+Axellogic> I always find it interesting how sometimes the dropped frames turn you into a black abyss

[0:37:12] <Dlent_> Anime
[0:37:15] <Nelsukako> @filthywanko i like how trash it is, like the interaction of the characters, and sometimes it has some good dialogues in it (especially in V3), but eh, each of their one i guess
[0:37:32] <Nelsukako> *trashy
[0:37:33] <Spagheddies> The game has a way of making obvious what it doesn't have to, and making obtuse what it should make clear.
[0:37:34] <%cosmicleviathan18> someone need to give this dude a comb
[0:38:09] <Nelsukako> @rdddy k

[0:38:46] <rdddy> @Nelsukako :p
[0:39:47] <Spagheddies> More expressiveness means more funny faces the stream will freeze on, and will be easier to turn to emotes.

[0:41:36] <+Mekhet09> bald people can be hot.
[0:41:37] <rittergeist> Just market yourself to girls with daddy isssues.
[0:41:39] <%cosmicleviathan18> it's kind of strange
[0:41:44] <garlicapostle> I think you're selling yourself short plague
[0:41:48] <rdddy> @PlagueOfGripes have pride in that big bald dome

[0:46:54] <Nelsukako> nah, its a cute bored farm boy your cat dont worry
[0:47:00] <Skeletonmanners> this series' use of perspective is actively upsetting
[0:47:05] <Skeletonmanners> like actual paper cutout aesthetic
[0:47:19] <cap_bon> Its a good thing that guys a robot becuase that bodies been there awhile now
[0:47:59] <%Revan175757> i mean if you grow out your nails cause you're a cavewoman like Akane, then it's possible
[0:48:01] <Nelsukako> @Skeletonmanners it¬¥s the syle of the serie tho. I think it¬¥s pretty cool
[0:48:05] <$Rshiners> isnt it because youre digging your nails into your palm
[0:48:20] <rdddy> suicided himself? whats the opposite of that suiciding someone else? kek

[0:49:50] <%Explodincatz> it was Mario i can feel it
[0:50:03] <Spagheddies> Plague, hold it in. Nobody has subbed yet.
[0:50:03] <rdddy> its hammer time
[0:50:07] <+legioned247> lol
[0:50:08] <cap_bon> Gotta craft this rube goldberg machine so I can commit the perfect crim
[0:50:26] <+legioned247> hair ball
[0:50:30] <+PleasantLee> at least the animal penis facts have dropped off
[0:50:34] <lambishly> The killer was clearly Super Mario
[0:50:54] <Nelsukako> you drawn cartoons for a living tho
[0:50:55] <rdddy> its funny how many ppl got butthurt over your naruto video @PlagueOfGripes
[0:51:14] <Mizaiya> cause video games
[0:51:33] <Spagheddies> Funnier than that is that Plague was entirely on point with that fucking video.
[0:51:34] <Nelsukako> @rdddy they hate him because he speaks the truth
[0:51:34] <Eger007> the simplest crimes are hardest to solve, more steps in a plan more chances to fuck up
[0:52:10] <Mizaiya> Does japan have maritime law? Spring forward fall back?
[0:52:22] <+legioned247> I like plague of gripes hot take videos it cool hearing his opinion on thing
[0:52:23] <%Revan175757> Eli you interested at all in Shin Megami Tensei V?
[0:52:24] <Mizaiya> if thats what its called
[0:52:26] <+legioned247> things
[0:52:47] <Mizaiya> day lights saving time thats it
[0:53:00] <rdddy> @Nelsukako ive seen this quite a bit in the anime community, disliking something that someone else likes, they take it as if they just got called a slur
[0:53:14] <%Revan175757> Persona but mainline series
[0:53:15] <Spagheddies> @PlagueOfGripes It's Persona but without the social aspect.
[0:53:19] <BR0Speedwagon> It's a JRPG
[0:53:26] <+Axellogic> now known as "Not Persona"
[0:53:31] <BR0Speedwagon> The Persona series is a spin off from it.
[0:53:31] <%Explodincatz> its Persona before Persona existed
[0:53:39] <rdddy> @Nelsukako and also you have to either love the show completely or hate if, if you have gripes with it ur a hater perio
[0:53:44] <rdddy> @Nelsukako d*
[0:53:47] <%Revan175757> it's persona were you kill your friends and then kill God
[0:53:57] <BR0Speedwagon> @Explodincatz Well, Persona before Persona, becoming Persona.
[0:54:10] <+legioned247> it is the main series yes
[0:54:13] <+ThomasOfTroy> No one, that's why Persona is more popular, despite being the side series
[0:54:20] <BR0Speedwagon> SMT games usually have a good story.
[0:54:28] <+legioned247> to kill god
[0:54:29] <LunarRemix> It's more of an adventure kind of RPG
[0:54:42] <Nelsukako> @rdddy i can understand tho. It is a pretty dumb thing to do but i understand; it is like saying indirected that the person has a bad taste if she like it, and that is kind of a insult even if its a unintentional one
[0:54:44] <%Revan175757> it's very bleak, sad, nihilistic, it's everything you love Plague
[0:54:50] <Spagheddies> SMT games usually have redeeming qualities, though it's obvious most people prefer Persona.
[0:55:18] <+Demerson13> Da doy daught da dasketdall
[0:55:22] <+Mekhet09> 1-3 are way better then persona. 4 kind of jumped as a story. i'm hoping 5 fixes it.
[0:55:34] <+legioned247> plague of grapes murdering god or the devil is fun sometimes
[0:55:39] <%boltman_37> interested in streaming a Persona?
[0:55:41] <Spagheddies> Nocturne, despite the issues that it has, is fucking stellar at times.
[0:55:43] <%Explodincatz> duh doy bucko
[0:55:55] <rdddy> @Nelsukako but going by that logic you cant criticise anything since it would be more or less an attack on a persons taste, also i can hate something about a show and still like it, with alot of people theres no middleground at all
[0:55:59] <Nelsukako> @rdddy on the internet, everything is 8 or 8000 unfortunately :/
[0:56:14] <+Mekhet09> i think you'd like smt 3.
[0:56:23] <%Revan175757> Nocturne is great, i think it's better than IV and Apocalypse
[0:56:26] <Spagheddies> The Door Dimension
[0:56:27] <rdddy> @Nelsukako true
[0:56:31] <+Mekhet09> and devil survivors.
[0:56:54] <+Mekhet09> i mean digital devil saga.
[0:57:00] <+legioned247> devil survivor was crazy
[0:57:04] <%Revan175757> Eli you are thinking too hard about things again
[0:57:14] <+Mekhet09> @revan175757 i agree.
[0:57:14] <Sokumotanaka> @boltman_37 I'd love watching him shit on persona 4
[0:57:20] <%Revan175757> god dumber, its Danganronpadumba
[0:57:27] <Nelsukako> @rdddy i told that it was a dumb thing. I said that i understand it, but it is still dumb that people think like that
[0:57:31] <Spagheddies> It's called Danganronpa, not Doorgoneronpa, Plague.
[0:57:48] <Daxalog> hes da jokah
[0:58:01] <rdddy> @Nelsukako dont worry i understood that :D
[0:58:01] <Mizaiya> I think Nagito is gonna get beat up by the angry girl
[0:58:19] <%Revan175757> @Mekhet09 SeemsGood
[0:58:47] <%boltman_37> @Mizaiya i wish i was ;)
[0:58:59] <Spagheddies> Nagito is going to beat up by someone.
[0:59:03] <Spagheddies> I hope.
[0:59:04] <%cosmicleviathan18> oh no are going back to strawberry walls?! bo8Monka varsitySick
[0:59:06] <Nelsukako> @rdddy ok then. Good to know GlitchCat
[0:59:31] <%Revan175757> good question!
[0:59:59] <rdddy> @Nelsukako also sry for that terrible spelling english is far from my native language NotLikeThis
[1:00:20] <Daxalog> He got the cut
[1:00:20] <+YabbaTroll> goddamn
[1:00:24] <%Revan175757> he means they all have the same time on them.
[1:00:33] <Sokumotanaka> Answerr me mafia baby XD
[1:00:42] <%cosmicleviathan18> LUL
[1:00:43] <+legioned247> lol
[1:00:46] <%Revan175757> so he presumes they werent tampered with, i assume
[1:01:11] <+legioned247> grapes wishes murder on this man for his bad hair
[1:01:12] <Nelsukako> @rdddy nah, i am doing a even worse job expelling it correctly, dont worry. English also isnt my first language
[1:01:20] <%Revan175757> you said that it makes no sense, member that xD
[1:01:31] <+PleasantLee> congratulations
[1:01:34] <%boltman_37> how long does this investigation go NotLikeThis NotLikeThis NotLikeThis
[1:01:40] <%Explodincatz> yu wife
[1:01:41] <+PleasantLee> how long have you been dom and sub?
[1:01:43] <rdddy> @Nelsukako i see
[1:01:53] <Nelsukako> @boltman_37 it will go for a while....
[1:01:54] <+legioned247> booba wife
[1:02:02] <%cosmicleviathan18> she could snap our spine and Gripes would die happy
[1:02:02] <Johnmaddened> wife she is
[1:02:08] <Nested_Dreams> the ducking octagon
[1:02:15] <rdddy> as someone who has been basicaly bald since the age of 23 i agree
[1:02:20] <%Revan175757> this game is so fucking dumb, i hate it, it's great xD
[1:03:05] <Coystick> hay hay
[1:03:19] <+legioned247> lol
[1:03:31] <%cosmicleviathan18> I bet if we threw enough money at Gripes he would wear one bo8Bsmug
[1:03:31] <+legioned247> maybe
[1:04:06] <Nelsukako> @Revan175757 meh, to be fair 80% of all the media we consume is dumb as fuck. I am use to it already
[1:04:25] <%Revan175757> oh yeah, i wanted to ask Plague about kotor. Do you think there is even a slight chance that KOTOR 2  Remake can be a thing in the future?
[1:04:31] <%Revan175757> Would you want that?
[1:04:34] <Spagheddies> Bwain
[1:04:42] <+legioned247> that button on her shirt is about to explode gripes
[1:04:45] <%boltman_37> i'm honestly at a loss, i don't understand this building
[1:05:30] <%Revan175757> but would you want that without Avelone?
[1:05:37] <Spagheddies> Things did change, Plague. Primarily, Bioware.
[1:05:39] <%Explodincatz> how can they remake a game that wasnt even finished
[1:05:42] <%cosmicleviathan18> I'm apparently one of the few people who liked the original KORTOR more than the second one
[1:05:55] <cap_bon> Executive: But can it make all the money like the CoD
[1:06:01] <+legioned247> plagueof gripes is going lose an eye talking to his wife that button going make his eye go bye bye
[1:06:07] <Spagheddies> @cap_bon *like FIFA
[1:06:12] <rdddy> i never got into starwars whatsoever
[1:06:33] <%Revan175757> maaaaaaaan Eli you just kicked me in the dick with that, RE3R was heartbreaking
[1:07:24] <Nelsukako> i like resi 3 remake tho :v it could be a lot better, but it has some really cool mechanics over there with the Jill dodge button and Carlos punching things
[1:07:28] <%boltman_37> what are other games you plan on streaming?
[1:07:37] <SuperVaderMan> does the entire structure rotate, or just the middle tower?
[1:07:38] <cap_bon> Delta rune tommorow
[1:08:04] <rdddy> this part of the game is a lot longer then it needs to be.... reminds me of certain 3 hour superman movies...
[1:08:13] <franctastic_> dude this trial is going to suck really hard NotLikeThis
[1:08:30] <%Revan175757> It's also the case of translation apperently being not so great
[1:08:39] <%Revan175757> or so i've read
[1:08:40] <Coystick> Oh yeah, the Paige game
[1:09:23] <rittergeist> The music in this game really gets grating after a short while.
[1:09:24] <filthywanko> @Revan175757 nah i speak both jp and en and play these for reading practice. The EN translation is ass.
[1:09:43] <franctastic_> LUL
[1:09:50] <Spagheddies> Yeah, I do recall reading very frequently that the localization, for this game specifically, is not particularly good.
[1:09:59] <Nelsukako> @Revan175757 thats sad :/
[1:10:02] <%Revan175757> @Revan175757 oh, well...now im sad
[1:10:20] <%cosmicleviathan18> Judge I just feel like he's guilty, I submit this into evidence
[1:10:22] <Spagheddies> That there's a fan translation that's apparently much better, or more accurate, or something like that.
[1:10:25] <%boltman_37> plauge, have you ever tried the ace attorney games?
[1:10:49] <UrsaDoom> So is Plague having fun?
[1:10:57] <%boltman_37> @cosmicleviathan18 LUL LUL
[1:11:15] <%Revan175757> @UrsaDoom No, so it's great xD
[1:11:17] <+legioned247> plague are you having fun
[1:11:39] <Nelsukako> @UrsaDoom we probably will never know as always
[1:12:04] <DeaDHer015> evoHiYo
[1:12:15] <%Revan175757> Plague, really though, do you actually enjoy playing this game at all?
[1:12:30] <%cosmicleviathan18> the door just rotates
[1:12:53] <DeaDHer015> LuvUok
[1:13:17] <UrsaDoom> He does seem engaged at least
[1:13:42] <%Revan175757> the art for some characters is cool though
[1:13:49] <Skeletonmanners> did you play any of the phoenix wright games plague? those seem to be more like what you want
[1:13:50] <%Revan175757> they are pleasant to look at
[1:14:22] <tukds> You still haven't beaten this game yet?
[1:14:32] <Spagheddies> The Ace Attorney games are a little bit more grounded most of the times, but they can still be goofy as shit.
[1:15:51] <SuperVaderMan> yeah I'm sure it's been said 100 times, but I think an ace attorney game could be a palette cleanse after this
[1:16:12] <+legioned247> walnuts crushing thighs
[1:16:14] <%Revan175757> i prefer Sonya, she is mad kinky, so you know she is good time xD
[1:16:19] <Sokumotanaka> More effort than most o these nerds tbh.  I rather someone look out a window and help than be told "I dont know what's going on." several times.
[1:16:21] <zam47> Go slep
[1:16:23] <+waterboy_tv_> I played one of the deoms like 8 years ago
[1:16:26] <%Explodincatz> they drag on super long tho
[1:16:27] <%Bigchill___> The PW trilogy is great
[1:16:31] <+waterboy_tv_> demos
[1:16:32] <franctastic_> also they show the culprit at the beginnig of each chapter
[1:16:36] <LunarRemix> A little bit better because it's often not a who-did-it but it's most of the times you trying to prove to the court How and Why it was done
[1:16:41] <BR0Speedwagon> In regards to death game VN's, I would say that "Your Turn To Die", handles its premise and characters better than Danganronpa.
[1:17:05] <BR0Speedwagon> It's at least more consistent.
[1:17:08] <Spagheddies> She's about to go BREAST MODE
[1:17:12] <Spagheddies> *BEAST MODE
[1:17:26] <%cosmicleviathan18> I'll take this seriously!!! *sips on margarita*
[1:17:26] <%Revan175757> they actually do
[1:17:28] <+waterboy_tv_> heyhey
[1:17:32] <SuperVaderMan> Akane is like the dog
[1:17:45] <franctastic_> LUL
[1:17:48] <%cosmicleviathan18> ew
[1:17:51] <%Revan175757> um tha'ts wrong
[1:17:56] <%Explodincatz> vore time
[1:18:04] <Sokumotanaka> wouldn't that kill them if they didn't move?
[1:18:13] <Sokumotanaka> CAVE OF WONDERS!?
[1:18:27] <SuperVaderMan> I mean, yeah, goodbye entire crime scene
[1:18:31] <%Revan175757> It's fiiiine
[1:18:38] <UrsaDoom> Take the vorepill
[1:18:43] <+legioned247> it fine
[1:19:00] <tukds> They all kind of treated him like a freak in that body so they didn't seem to care.
[1:19:08] <filthywanko> Hamsters are assholes. They bite
[1:19:14] <%cosmicleviathan18> wtf this familiar are hamsters?! LUL
[1:19:23] <LunarRemix> Fish are weirdly a lot of trouble
[1:19:33] <vladtet909> They're not hamsters Plague, they're his four Dark Devas of Destruction
[1:19:34] <LunarRemix> You'd think they wouldn't be but they are
[1:20:01] <filthywanko> Anybody else get those beta fish from walmart only for them to die in under 2 days
[1:20:35] <Sokumotanaka> @filthywanko Shocker, animals that use their mouths to interact with things bite, like dogs and cats do without thinking >.>
[1:20:39] <Spagheddies> H O P E M A N
[1:20:41] <SuperVaderMan> Nagito just wants to Hope really hard
[1:20:42] <%cosmicleviathan18> Before I die, MAKE THIS MAN COMB HIS HAIR!!!
[1:20:50] <franctastic_> H O P E Kreygasm
[1:20:52] <Spagheddies> HE'S GONNA H O P E
[1:21:15] <Spagheddies> The Darkness, or some shit?
[1:21:19] <Spagheddies> Or, like, Chaos?
[1:21:28] <DeadWizardpl> I feel ya
[1:21:30] <+legioned247> yes
[1:21:35] <theloganbrand> The wikipedia page Kojima read that day
[1:21:35] <%Explodincatz> philosophical?
[1:21:42] <SuperVaderMan> Japanese abstract filler talk
[1:21:45] <%cosmicleviathan18> gonna splurge his hope all over his face
[1:21:58] <Spagheddies> t. Nebulous Anime Bullshit
[1:22:04] <UrsaDoom> I remember FF7Remake annoying me a lot with the delivery
[1:22:05] <+legioned247> I know what your talking about like justice there justice is the only true justice
[1:22:17] <%cosmicleviathan18> plagueFace plagueFace plagueFace
[1:22:18] <tukds> heavy rain?
[1:22:53] <Spagheddies> Man, fucking Nojima, Nomura and Toriyama LOVE their nebulous anime bullshit.
[1:23:03] <bleugh> you just don't understand HOPE
[1:23:26] <%Explodincatz> I remember that scene
[1:23:49] <UrsaDoom> 2deep4u
[1:24:14] <Spagheddies> H O P E M A N is going full SOCIETY on my main man Hajime.
[1:24:16] <franctastic_> Persona 4 and "Truth" becomes like the thing everyone talks about
[1:24:31] <+legioned247> plague of gripes justice is the only true justice he is the hope that will save the universe
[1:24:36] <%cosmicleviathan18> it would be so easy to snap is scrawny little neck bo8Monka bo8Monka bo8Monka
[1:25:12] <SuperVaderMan> Having some ground work laid for how the fuck the setting works would be nice
[1:25:22] <bleugh> gravel swimsuit made perfect sense
[1:25:28] <+legioned247> yes
[1:25:30] <Spagheddies> Quick question, Plague: Is there any reason you have Wall 2 in the wall behind you, or is it purely coincidental?
[1:25:37] <Spagheddies> Also gravel swimsuit was bullshit.
[1:25:52] <UrsaDoom> Consistency is for nerds
[1:25:54] <+legioned247> I seen games brake there own logic
[1:26:00] <franctastic_> oh my god
[1:26:04] <SuperVaderMan> Japanese humor???
[1:26:06] <@Nightbot> @Revan175757 -> You're mistaken. [stop spamming symbols] [warning]
[1:26:10] <DeadWizardpl> ???
[1:26:14] <%cosmicleviathan18> wtf?!
[1:26:17] <+legioned247> what
[1:26:18] <franctastic_> ITS FUNNY THO 4Head
[1:26:21] <%Revan175757> fuck this game
[1:26:39] <%Revan175757> yeah, i forgot xD
[1:26:41] <+ArCielArDor> sounds like some weird Mistranslation nonsense
[1:26:59] <Sokumotanaka> Idk plague I disagree, I think it's obvious that when someone dies it goes without saying that DR makes it obvious and when it's cartoony you're suppose to hate monokuma cause he's just joking and shitting over a dead body.
[1:26:59] <%Bigchill___> and then he took a huge robo-shit
[1:27:08] <Spagheddies> Yes. Mikan is dead.
[1:27:11] <%cosmicleviathan18> time to shoot some truth!!!
[1:27:14] <%Revan175757> red = dead
[1:27:18] <DeadWizardpl> red=dead
[1:27:20] <+ThomasOfTroy> ^^
[1:27:26] <%Explodincatz> red is dead is red
[1:27:35] <franctastic_> ded=read
[1:27:36] <$Rshiners> i miss fat byakuya
[1:27:37] <Spagheddies> Red is dead, redemption. 2

[1:28:07] <SuperVaderMan> You know the trial's gonna take like 5 hours
[1:28:10] <franctastic_> at least the trials are fully voiced
[1:28:21] <+legioned247> hope and justice plague hope and justice
[1:28:52] <Johnmaddened> v3 gets even worse with trial length
[1:28:55] <%Revan175757> i think music is the only part of this series i legitimately enjoy
[1:29:06] <+legioned247> I so sorry for your suffering plague
[1:29:11] <franctastic_> man I remember the first of V3, the 1st was like almost 4hr
[1:29:22] <franctastic_> I didnt even care for the twist because so tired
[1:29:31] <franctastic_> *I was
[1:29:46] <%Revan175757> yeah , i watched it xD
[1:29:52] <+legioned247> oh ok
[1:30:44] <%Revan175757> did you notice his eyes though?
[1:30:45] <franctastic_> cmon Hajime is doing his best
[1:30:51] <Spagheddies> They couldn't give my boy Hajime an idle stance so he wouldn't look like a mouthbreather.
[1:30:52] <%Explodincatz> Matt would make a side channel called "Whodunnit"
[1:31:03] <Daxalog> Ive never had a rabbit before
[1:31:31] <theloganbrand> that's a good face

[1:32:09] <%boltman_37> because cute
[1:32:15] <Eger007> isnt it all of one piece?
[1:32:18] <@Nightbot> Plague is a youtube animator and also streams at https://picarto.tv/Plague . Also: t-shirts! http://goo.gl/lze8QO
[1:32:19] <+rdark_ksu> Chie= meat and steak 1000x
[1:32:31] <franctastic_> another japanese thing is that they looove pointing out the funny thing
[1:32:36] <Spagheddies> Probably because eating well = being strong, or some shit.
[1:32:36] <%Revan175757> OH THEY FOKING
[1:33:20] <%cosmicleviathan18> why are there so many innuendos
[1:33:27] <franctastic_> Johnny Young Bosch's voice Kreygasm

[1:36:38] <%kyh9> k-nife
[1:36:39] <Aceofhearts87> Any guess on who did it?
[1:37:18] <SuperVaderMan> Any guess is as good as any other at this point
[1:37:33] <%Bigchill___> There is never enough information to solve the murder before the trial, or even information that you cannot know.
[1:37:38] <filthywanko> Yeah they dont give u the means to determine the killer before the trial. That always did annoy me
[1:37:41] <UrsaDoom> Bid tiddy girl is sus
[1:37:48] <%Revan175757> well Eli you misremembering how it went sadly
[1:38:01] <SuperVaderMan> It's like poetry, it rhymes
[1:38:01] <%boltman_37> @UrsaDoom which of them? LUL
[1:38:11] <%Revan175757> it was painfully telegraphed and set up in the worst dumbest way possible
[1:38:25] <UrsaDoom> The one with the clevage
[1:39:19] <%Revan175757> please remember that this trial is VERY dumb
[1:39:22] <Spagheddies> Akane.
[1:39:43] <%cosmicleviathan18> LUL
[1:39:49] <+Deadbulky> vargSkell
[1:39:59] <Spagheddies> KEKW jesus
[1:40:04] <Daxalog> Its totally going to be Akane isnt it?
[1:40:05] <%Explodincatz> but its true
[1:40:15] <lemoan> @Revan175757 No, ALL the trials are dumb
[1:40:22] <SuperVaderMan> The stupidest guess would be Akane, so I vote her
[1:40:22] <+legioned247> lol
[1:40:27] <+legioned247> wow
[1:40:28] <heartlesshealer> Ultimate Chuunibyou
[1:40:30] <+legioned247> lol
[1:40:32] <Daxalog> I thought you liked Gundham?
[1:40:33] <Spagheddies> The Chuuni archetype is fucking insufferable.
[1:40:35] <%Revan175757> @lemoan well yeah, but i hate this one the most
[1:40:44] <%boltman_37> but he BREEDS
[1:40:48] <+rdark_ksu> of course he's stupid, he's anime
[1:40:59] <Daxalog> Hes the ultimate Breeder. Thats your thing. Being Ultimate!
[1:41:03] <UrsaDoom> He does have the cool foreskin scarf
[1:41:05] <Sokumotanaka> you leave gundamn alone
[1:41:05] <Nested_Dreams> He would be the quiet sensitive guy in a wester version of danganronpa

[2:06:47] <Daxalog> You only have so many cuts it seems
[2:07:00] <%StridentSong> You have a limited number of slices you can do per section
[2:07:03] <%KELTHUZAD9999> it has limited uses
[2:07:06] <+Deadbulky> Your using way to many cuts
[2:07:08] <%kyh9> You have limited number of cuts I guess
[2:07:11] <filthywanko> Slice one way twice and then the opposite way for more damage
[2:07:16] <%kyh9> Bottom right hand corner
[2:07:21] <%cosmicleviathan18> pain
[2:07:24] <+Double_Tap_That> You have limited cuts
[2:07:28] <%Revan175757> lower right angle - ammount of cuts
[2:08:24] <%Revan175757> cause you have to cut vertically or horizontally depending on how words you cut are possitioned
[2:08:39] <%Revan175757> there we go

[2:26:46] <%cosmicleviathan18> how old is this game
[2:27:00] <lemoan> @Revan175757 This game is filled with this for every case and it's honestly infuriating
[2:27:04] <%PleasantLee> @PeachSaliva Thanks for the gift sub! cheers doll
[2:27:18] <Eger007> she's a "foreigner" of this game
[2:27:46] <%Revan175757> @lemoan it's just padding, useless padding to increase game time
[2:28:15] <%PleasantLee> plagueFace plagueGripes plagueImoya plagueChirei
[2:28:20] <theloganbrand> She would WRITE this
[2:28:23] <lemoan> @Revan175757 It probably wouldn't be as bad if it wasn't for the fact these cases can go on for HOURS!

[2:32:24] <lemoan> @KELTHUZAD9999 yes and no. The writing is also really fucking stretching it.
[2:33:42] <%KELTHUZAD9999> the writers clearly were on drugs to think they could stretch a discution this much like this
[2:33:54] <%Revan175757> i dont remember this one
[2:33:58] <%cosmicleviathan18> the pillar maybe?
[2:34:08] <%Explodincatz> there a fast forward button as well

[2:35:14] <+Damie904> See if any of the clues mention what his body is?

[2:38:48] <%Explodincatz> yay...
[2:39:41] <Sokumotanaka> Considering luchajin lives this game, nay LOVES it and her and paige share alot of personality ticks, I think peach would like it.

[2:40:32] <%Revan175757> not smart
[2:40:39] <%Explodincatz> slightly intuitive
[2:40:43] <+Shockrates20XX> A couple of smart people who withhold information for no reason.
[2:40:59] <%Revan175757> those who read the script like 2 pages ahead

[2:41:39] <lemoan> I am now remembering why this game is some fucking annoying
[2:41:39] <%cosmicleviathan18> Is everyone here really this dense?!
[2:41:44] <Eger007> BUT CAN YOU SPELL IT?
[2:41:58] <%Explodincatz> has to be in order too
[2:42:00] <ralphwiggum16> Plague, do you remember "now you're tap-dancing in hell!!!"
[2:42:13] <UrsaDoom> Why is mini game?
[2:42:30] <lemoan> It's a god damn elAvator game. JUTS LET HIM SPELL ELAVATOR
[2:42:39] <Spagheddies> God, I remember one of these that was utter shit. Not because of how obvious it was, but because of how nebulous the answer they wanted was.
[2:42:53] <Ethel9727> @Spagheddies Meat on the Bone?
[2:42:56] <SuperVaderMan> E L E V A T O R
[2:43:10] <DeadWizardpl> Gasp!

[2:43:26] <%Explodincatz> body transporter
[2:43:44] <bleugh> it needs to go on for 2 hours
[2:43:45] <%Revan175757> Pat is being weird on twitter again
[2:44:01] <Spagheddies> If he's doing it again, then why is it important?
[2:44:03] <cinless> i'm confused, can someone tell me what an elevator is? i am a small fish living at crush depth of the mariana trench; this game's target audience
[2:44:04] <CrimsonFox777> NANI?!
[2:44:14] <UrsaDoom> Why is there two character portraits?

[2:46:14] <+legioned247> Eli looks like he tired of this shit
[2:46:23] <lemoan> @cosmicleviathan18 Wait, this was a murder trial?
[2:46:38] <Mathochism> So, do people actually ironically enjoy the Danganronpa series?
[2:46:45] <Mathochism> unironically
[2:46:53] <+legioned247> Eli ready to retire from this case
[2:46:54] <%cosmicleviathan18> @lemoan yes we are trying to find out who is a murder
[2:46:59] <%Revan175757> the lightbulb flash in your brain that feels good
[2:47:08] <Spagheddies> Yes. The trials are dumb as hell, but there's some redeeming qualities to both.
[2:47:16] <Spagheddies> Both games, I meant to type.
[2:47:28] <%TheLordOfTheScrubs> ok yea I forgot there was a dead robot that started all of this... storydCri
[2:47:34] <lemoan> @cosmicleviathan18 yeah I know I'm joking. That's just how far removed from the point of this trial we are.
[2:47:37] <%Revan175757> Japanese detective stories never give you that, everything has to be overexplained, chewed and spit in your mouth
[2:47:45] <%cosmicleviathan18> @lemoan LUL
[2:48:16] <lemoan> @Mathochism somehow? I don't a single person enjoys the actual "game" They just like the art or characters
[2:48:23] <%Revan175757> but they said that themselves already
[2:48:26] <%Revan175757> what
[2:48:37] <Sokumotanaka> relax
[2:48:39] <%Revan175757> they just talking about the same thing over and over
[2:48:48] <%cosmicleviathan18> it's painful how dense these people are
[2:48:49] <Murphio_GS> Monke
[2:49:01] <bleugh> but couldn't you just look up
[2:49:03] <UrsaDoom> Maybe it's a translation problem?
[2:49:19] <%Revan175757> @UrsaDoom i hope it is
[2:49:36] <Spagheddies> Yeah, there was no fun in this house.
[2:49:41] <@Nightbot> @SuperVaderMan -> Nice try. [stop spamming symbols] [warning]
[2:49:44] <%TheLordOfTheScrubs> this isn't even fun
[2:49:45] <Samex_Comex> Needs more clowns

[2:50:48] <lemoan> WHAT!?!?!
[2:51:12] <%Revan175757> not if the killer is very dumb
[2:52:06] <%FingaLights> It's so stupid it's smart
[2:52:17] <%cosmicleviathan18> FORGET ABOUT THE BUILDING STURCTURE!!!
[2:52:22] <+legioned247> detective Eli on the case ten seconds into the murder mystery it was that guy they gun residue on his hands and blood on his sleeves
[2:52:32] <@Nightbot> Plague is a youtube animator and also streams at https://picarto.tv/Plague . Also: t-shirts! http://goo.gl/lze8QO
[2:52:34] <DeadWizardpl> maybe a dumb person killed him
[2:53:13] <SuperVaderMan> HOLD ON, SLOW DOWN, I AM STUPID
[2:53:15] <Spagheddies> SLOW DOWN, I'M STUPID
[2:53:17] <%Revan175757> wow not even hiding the padding
[2:53:25] <Spagheddies> SONIAA

[2:54:01] <franctastic_> NotLikeThis NotLikeThis NotLikeThis
[2:54:06] <+legioned247> lol that oh God from eli
[2:54:19] <UrsaDoom> How does elevator work?
[2:54:22] <%Revan175757> when you are very dumb, complicated = smart
[2:54:30] <%Explodincatz> r e a l i t y
[2:54:43] <%KELTHUZAD9999> then that will have been a better game
[2:54:47] <Sokumotanaka> they can't they're trapped here
[2:55:01] <%TheLordOfTheScrubs> at this point I'm siding more that the Robot actually killed himself just so it didn't have to be apart of this idiocracy NotLikeThis
[2:55:03] <DeadWizardpl> NOT CONVOLUTED ENOUGH
[2:55:06] <%Explodincatz> what if one just planted a bomb and killed everyone else at once
[2:55:17] <%Revan175757> i like this argument
[2:55:19] <lemoan> @TheLordOfTheScrubs he was the smart one
[2:55:34] <Sokumotanaka> Sonia he's not gonna fuck you bro!
[2:55:36] <%KELTHUZAD9999> but even with all this bullshit and stupidity I am gonna buy this
[2:55:37] <%Revan175757> lol hahaha
[2:55:39] <%cosmicleviathan18> WHY DOSE THIS MATTER?!
[2:55:41] <%Explodincatz> how could this mean?!
[2:55:48] <%FingaLights> Sonia "How can this BE?!"
[2:56:02] <%Revan175757> piss baby Hajime
[2:56:12] <UrsaDoom> The vibe is that the writer desperately wants to convince you that they're smart
[2:56:17] <Mathochism> Homestar Runner meets Danganronpa is the crossover we needed.
[2:56:32] <8hoursofdrugs> but if two houses then how am this real? explain logic mans
[2:57:07] <%Explodincatz> Homestar Runner makes a comeback with a dangolgrandpa LP
[2:57:15] <Samex_Comex> I just noticed the chef is crossed out with a fork and knife and the nurse has a plus
[2:57:31] <%Revan175757> NO PLEASE
[2:57:35] <%Revan175757> i dont wana
[2:57:42] <Spagheddies> @UrsaDoom Look, all I'm saying is, there's a reason why the writer was given the nickname "Kohacka"
[2:57:43] <SoFarFetched> the key to the key to the key you want
[2:57:44] <+TheOverwhelmingShotgun> sometimes this game feels like murder mystery for toddlers "Can you spell elevator?"
[2:57:57] <%KELTHUZAD9999> hell, you just described hell
[2:58:00] <%Explodincatz> so debating
[2:58:25] <Sokumotanaka> I'd pay you to do it @PlagueOfGripes
[2:58:37] <Spagheddies> I've had to write mysteries before, and I can assure you it's not fucking easy.
[2:58:41] <%Revan175757> the mystery of the broken bottle of piss
[2:58:44] <Samsaz> jesus CHRIST, enough with the elevators already
[2:58:54] <theloganbrand> Just don't name your stories the way Agatha Christie did
[2:59:04] <UrsaDoom> That's what a first draft is for
[2:59:07] <%Revan175757> no shut up Eli
[2:59:12] <lemoan> This is infuriatingly convoluted.
[2:59:21] <%Revan175757> this gmae is super smart, you just dont get it
[2:59:23] <%KELTHUZAD9999> yeah but the writer forgot that detail
[2:59:23] <Spagheddies> No, they're all dumb, they don't feel things.
[2:59:26] <Dlent_> The elevator was specifically very slow
[2:59:31] <+Shockrates20XX> No you can't feel when you're getting jerked.
[2:59:31] <Dlent_> So that they wouldn‚Äôt
[2:59:33] <SuperVaderMan> Monokuma probably got a giant boner from the fact the murder happened where it did, so all this convoluted architecture gets to be talked about
[2:59:39] <8hoursofdrugs> not if they were spinning around blowing raspberries in the elevator
[2:59:40] <%Explodincatz> Japanese have their own physics engine
[2:59:41] <%TheLordOfTheScrubs> things spinning? IS THAT EVEN POSSIBLE!?!
[2:59:42] <SoFarFetched> "Why are we having fun?"
[2:59:42] <cthulu_fearlock> if it wasn't convoluted I would be bored
[2:59:49] <lemoan> Thank you for skipping that Eli
[2:59:52] <Murphio_GS> What is a funhouse anyway
[3:00:20] <Samex_Comex> He's a shithead
[3:00:24] <lemoan> @cthulu_fearlock This has gone on so long that I'm bored
[3:00:28] <Sokumotanaka> He's uppity that he hates Hajime cause he's not an ultimate.
[3:00:29] <SuperVaderMan> 8 glorious sides
[3:00:41] <Murphio_GS> Duh doi
[3:00:44] <%cosmicleviathan18> define octagon LUL LUL LUL
[3:00:48] <+legioned247> wait what
[3:00:55] <%Revan175757> well if i won a russian roulette with 5 fucking bullets loaded out of 6 i would act all smug and superior too, to be honest
[3:00:56] <+legioned247> lol
[3:01:00] <Kkeyf> eight fantastic sides, and eight awesome angles!
[3:01:07] <Mathochism> That was an actual question. My god.
[3:01:21] <franctastic_> oh god i remember this one NotLikeThis NotLikeThis NotLikeThis
[3:01:22] <8hoursofdrugs> this is becoming anime dora the explorer. Can you spot the octagon?
[3:01:24] <Murphio_GS> That's a hexagon
[3:01:46] <%Johnmaddened> oh this one really sucks
[3:02:09] <filthywanko> ooohhhh boy this one
[3:02:10] <Dlent_> Damn, can‚Äôt believe Hajime did it
[3:02:10] <%Revan175757> its the green thing next to the blue thing
[3:02:22] <%Revan175757> i dont know how to explain it properly
[3:02:27] <SuperVaderMan> OH NO, I COULDN'T FIND THE OCTAGON I'M DEEEEAAAAD
[3:02:35] <%cosmicleviathan18> LUL LUL LUL
[3:02:35] <Spagheddies> Using logic, in this game, only makes things harder, plague. Remember, you have to be stupid.
[3:02:43] <%Revan175757> the triangle part
[3:02:50] <%Revan175757> i think
[3:02:55] <Kkeyf> but where on top is it?
[3:03:15] <%Johnmaddened> NotLikeThis
[3:03:20] <Samex_Comex> The clown room?
[3:03:33] <%Revan175757> lol
[3:03:35] <OldWorldFool> LUL
[3:03:38] <SuperVaderMan> That's fucking stupid
[3:03:46] <%Johnmaddened> shut up LUL
[3:03:48] <DeadWizardpl> ...
[3:03:50] <lemoan> I'm having an anuersism
[3:03:52] <%FingaLights> That's dumb
[3:03:54] <Spagheddies> The writer failed math. Who would've fucking guessed.
[3:03:55] <%Revan175757> this fucking hack of a writer was jerking himself to death at this point
[3:04:00] <Kkeyf> actshually...
[3:04:23] <lemoan> @Revan175757 All over the keyboard too
[3:04:28] <8hoursofdrugs> Nagito : do you know what an octagon is? Also Nagito: doesn't know what an octagon is
[3:05:08] <Murphio_GS> Let's talk 6 more hours retreading the same information
[3:05:26] <Spagheddies> Most everything. The relevant parts, which are, unfortunately, not the stuff this game likes to focus on.
[3:05:28] <lemoan> @Murphio_GS OH BOY MY FAVORITE. Shoot me now
[3:05:31] <theloganbrand> C
[3:05:37] <%KELTHUZAD9999> we have all lost some brain cells after this
[3:05:41] <%Revan175757> @lemoan assuming it wasnt the typewriter cause he is the real true writer
[3:05:52] <%Explodincatz> u spent 90min to learn about the structure
[3:06:05] <Samex_Comex> Please be Nagito so he can die
[3:06:13] <Spagheddies> I am having a serious LMAO right now
[3:06:16] <SuperVaderMan> These writers are hilarious 4Head
[3:06:17] <%cosmicleviathan18> wait we don't even find the murderer?!
[3:06:19] <Spagheddies> LOL'ing outloud
[3:06:21] <Murphio_GS> I think that joke was likely better in japanese
[3:06:23] <lemoan> wtf
[3:06:24] <%Revan175757> please skip her Eli
[3:06:26] <%Revan175757> please
[3:06:34] <Sokumotanaka> @cosmicleviathan18 the trial isn't over
[3:06:47] <Spagheddies> KEKW'ing, even
[3:07:22] <%Revan175757> WHAT
[3:07:35] <%Revan175757> there was a murderer in this case?
[3:07:35] <SuperVaderMan> Writers thinking they're more clever than they are tends to be insufferable, yes
[3:07:38] <%Revan175757> no way
[3:07:57] <Murphio_GS> hope Kreygasm
[3:08:06] <Samex_Comex> Ahhhhhh!
[3:08:13] <%Revan175757> god shut the fuck up nagito
[3:08:22] <Sokumotanaka> I'm positive the writer isn't calling themselves a genius, it's not out of the realm of possibility for the characters to be shocked by information XD
[3:08:33] <%cosmicleviathan18> this man and stepping stones
[3:08:41] <franctastic_> please H O P E all over me Kreygasm
[3:08:45] <lemoan> she likes meat
[3:08:47] <clod1_> I just passed this one I was very surprised
[3:08:56] <%Revan175757> you're so WET
[3:08:59] <%cosmicleviathan18> H O P E all over my face bo8Gasm bo8Gasm bo8Gasm
[3:09:00] <SuperVaderMan> That joke was so funny, we used it twice in the same trial
[3:09:00] <%Deadbulky> Moist
[3:09:01] <%HawkGoggles2> tropes are funny because that's all we have
[3:09:27] <%Deadbulky> vargKermit
[3:09:39] <%cosmicleviathan18> drool all over her booba
[3:09:55] <franctastic_> japanese humour is very in your face, they LOVE to point out the funny thing
[3:10:13] <Sokumotanaka> I mean to be fair we do it, too look at how many people jerk off FO4 piper despite her being the stereotype of reporters with no interesting character traits.
[3:10:52] <Spagheddies> To be entirely fair, those people probably find Piper hot, which immediately means their opinions are wrong.
[3:11:27] <Samex_Comex> Free balling
[3:11:30] <SuperVaderMan> We found out how Nekomaru died, time to take another hour to get to that point
[3:11:43] <Murphio_GS> Jesus
[3:11:43] <%Deadbulky> vargHet
[3:11:44] <Daxalog> ok
[3:11:46] <%Revan175757> good moxy from voice actor
[3:11:46] <%cosmicleviathan18> nice
[3:12:27] <+vascalan> my favourite VTuber yaaay
[3:12:46] <%cosmicleviathan18> by the amount of times he has been wrong, hamster man should be in the second circle of hell
[3:13:38] <SuperVaderMan> gee, if only there were a way to make nekomaru not move around
[3:14:05] <Sokumotanaka> @Spagheddies Yeah but we're talking about writing and in terms of writing piper was nothing special despite how hyped up people made FO4 to be.
[3:14:30] <%cosmicleviathan18> maybe he couldn't move was because maybe, idk, HE WAS TIED TO THE DOOR?!
[3:15:33] <lemoan> it's probably the chain
[3:15:53] <%Revan175757> was it good night button?
[3:16:11] <Frogwash> Does plague want the answer or figure it out?
[3:16:32] <+Damie904> Try it
[3:16:43] <UrsaDoom> That feeling of accomplishment of solving a padded out mystery tho
[3:16:59] <Spagheddies> It's the good night button on Kazuichi's claim.
[3:17:22] <Frogwash> It's gotta be the good night button due for the "elevator can't move due to moving object"
[3:18:03] <SuperVaderMan> because they're rambling about sensors detecting moving objects, right?
[3:18:48] <Spagheddies> Not to mention Nekomaru is a robot.
[3:19:14] <Samex_Comex> Do I have to dance in the elevator to make it move?
[3:19:39] <Spagheddies> At least half a dozen.
[3:19:41] <%Explodincatz> dancing money make floor move
[3:19:43] <Spagheddies> Probably.
[3:19:43] <lemoan> maybe like 4 more
[3:19:48] <%FingaLights> 6 before the body
[3:19:53] <lemoan> unfortunately
[3:19:58] <Sokumotanaka> She aint fucking that man, she's gonna peg him tho as punishment
[3:20:28] <Spagheddies> Blue is agreeing.
[3:20:29] <+Damie904> Yep
[3:20:35] <%Revan175757> blue is agree
[3:20:38] <lemoan> @Sokumotanaka she wouldn't even give him that much
[3:20:53] <terminusterminal> But if internal motion sets off the motion detector, wouldn't Nekomaru's clock still be working before his death.
[3:21:14] <lemoan> He's becoming a masochist
[3:21:24] <%Revan175757> its wire bullet on the broken doorknob
[3:21:43] <%cosmicleviathan18> soda my man LUL
[3:21:59] <%Revan175757> maybe it's better in japanese?
[3:22:04] <Spagheddies> This is the sort of game that is easier the dumber you are.
[3:22:14] <Spagheddies> Which is why I was able to do moderately okay.
[3:22:17] <Murphio_GS> Would've been better as an ace attorney styled minigame for the trials tbh
[3:22:35] <lemoan> @Revan175757 That would maaaybe help the dialogue but it would still be padded out the ass
[3:22:37] <Murphio_GS> A penis
[3:22:40] <%Explodincatz> good ol sleep bubble
[3:22:45] <ralphwiggum16> Y'know what's funny? All of this happened to me once.
[3:22:52] <lemoan> How that actual fuck
[3:23:31] <UrsaDoom> Benis :DDDD
[3:23:34] <vladtet909> Shut up cuckichi
[3:23:46] <%Revan175757> @lemoan padding as thick as K-son's ass
[3:24:06] <lemoan> @vladtet909 well he
[3:24:10] <SuperVaderMan> So if he was hung from the door, in between the pillars, how did he move sideways to bonk his head on the pillar
[3:24:31] <lemoan> @vladtet909 well he's actual has a "point" here
[3:26:23] <%Revan175757> that fucking doorknob is impossibly strong
[3:26:32] <%FingaLights> ye
[3:26:43] <Sokumotanaka> I mean it worked didn't it?
[3:26:46] <Spagheddies> H O P E M A N
[3:26:59] <Samex_Comex> How did the killer even lift a huge robot man and hang them
[3:27:00] <%FingaLights> GENIUS
[3:27:02] <%Revan175757> that's the dumbest fucking shit
[3:27:03] <%Explodincatz> he knows robots fear gravity
[3:27:10] <Spagheddies> Redtech.
[3:27:13] <SuperVaderMan> if it would easily slip off, he could've just slipped off as the elevator descended
[3:27:23] <lemoan> This is actually angering
[3:27:30] <+aRealBaboon> wouldn't the door knob snap off before this ever occured, the weight of a normal person can snap a door knob off they aren't built to hold 100lbs
[3:27:40] <%cosmicleviathan18> well thank goodness the elevator never moved before he died LUL
[3:28:21] <KgKid51> the Wile Coyote setup lol
[3:28:52] <Spagheddies> So the doorknobs were actually super strong and Nekomaru just pounded them broken, or what?
[3:29:09] <lemoan> Soda actual became a masochist
[3:29:10] <@PeachSaliva> Hey Eli, get fucked
[3:29:18] <Samex_Comex> Wow
[3:29:21] <Spagheddies> Oh boy, the mustard gremlin returns.
[3:29:21] <@PeachSaliva> I love coming in here and bullying Plague
[3:29:53] <+jorgamund> oof
[3:29:54] <Sokumotanaka> OOOOOOOOH
[3:29:54] <Spagheddies> The only thing bullying plague here is the game.
[3:29:56] <+FadingEmber> destroyed
[3:29:58] <Murphio_GS> Callout out
[3:29:59] <%Revan175757> can it be called bullying if he doesnt care? xD
[3:29:59] <CrimsonFox777> Sounds about right
[3:30:02] <@PeachSaliva> Noooooo
[3:30:11] <@PeachSaliva> ü•∫
[3:30:12] <wannabemoogle> Paige came her to get bullied
[3:30:13] <Sokumotanaka> Destructive finish!
[3:30:17] <%Axellogic> Paige go back to being excited for more not earthbound
[3:30:21] <Kkeyf> savage'd
[3:30:21] <lemoan> OOOOHHH
[3:30:24] <%Explodincatz> Plague should be a detective instead of an artist
[3:30:30] <%Revan175757> Paige how are you feeling today?
[3:30:31] <@PeachSaliva> Bruh I‚Äôve been working all day damn
[3:30:41] <SuperVaderMan> my wife, wall
[3:30:45] <@PeachSaliva> Yeah hot wife
[3:30:55] <%Revan175757> and thats pat
[3:31:00] <Murphio_GS> Taxes is important
[3:31:01] <@PeachSaliva> Congratulations on hot wife
[3:31:09] <@PeachSaliva> I have don‚Äôt worry
[3:31:20] <+DeadlyPeaks> Working all day = reading deltarune fanfic
[3:31:26] <+FadingEmber> Paige is know for tax evasion
[3:31:34] <+FadingEmber> *Paige is known for tax evasion
[3:31:35] <@PeachSaliva> @deadlypeaks lol I wish
[3:31:39] <AlarStormbringer> Gosh Dang 'an Ronpa
[3:32:10] <AlarStormbringer> LOL
[3:32:12] <Spagheddies> Time of death doesn't match, apparently.
[3:32:16] <ralphwiggum16> Paige is known for tax evasion?
[3:32:18] <@Nightbot> Plague is a youtube animator and also streams at https://picarto.tv/Plague . Also: t-shirts! http://goo.gl/lze8QO
[3:32:29] <Spagheddies> Which is bad because uhhhhh...
[3:32:30] <Murphio_GS> Clocks probably
[3:32:45] <@PeachSaliva> @ralphwiggum16 yeah me and yoshi are known for tax evasion
[3:32:59] <ralphwiggum16> I'm sorry to hear that Paige.
[3:33:15] <Murphio_GS> No, that's wroaaawng
[3:33:16] <%Revan175757> tax evasion is great, everyone should do it
[3:33:17] <CrimsonFox777> Darn illusionary clocks
[3:33:34] <ralphwiggum16> Can I just say this game is f*cking made my crazy people?
[3:33:34] <@PeachSaliva> Huh, your wife‚Äôs voice is familiar
[3:33:40] <ralphwiggum16> *by
[3:33:42] <canonshout> ULTIMATE GANGSTER
[3:33:43] <AlarStormbringer> He's got like a Zerg symbol on his eyepatch.
[3:33:45] <canonshout> REMEMBER IT
[3:33:46] <lemoan> BABY GANSTA
[3:33:53] <wannabemoogle> She sounds like Rukia a bit
[3:34:10] <@PeachSaliva> Why?
[3:34:41] <%Revan175757> she could not play Ace attourney, so i doubt Dangan is a possibility
[3:34:56] <Sokumotanaka> 2 is widely popular if she likes 1 I can totally see her streaming a little of 2
[3:34:58] <@PeachSaliva> Then why are you playing it?
[3:35:13] <BR0Speedwagon> Which is unfortunate, because V3, despite its own special issues, is the best written one. But you must get through 2.
[3:35:16] <%Revan175757> it's more like hate watch Paige
[3:35:16] <wannabemoogle> Two is only for experience like two or three characters
[3:35:23] <Sokumotanaka> I dont think because plague dislikes it that paige will
[3:35:25] <+reiface08> we do love his anger
[3:35:26] <+jorgamund> what?  I've never seen plague angry
[3:35:31] <%Revan175757> i like hearing Eli swear and bitch xD
[3:35:36] <BR0Speedwagon> Like, it ain't perfect, but it at least tries to be more consistent.
[3:35:36] <Murphio_GS> We do, we love you bitching
[3:35:37] <+ratchetex> I like the uplifting advice ;-;
[3:35:39] <%HawkGoggles2> That's how media works. Not good vibes only angy
[3:35:40] <%Arancet> bitch monkey, bitch
[3:35:41] <Samex_Comex> Today is Beast wars 25th anniversary
[3:35:47] <%FingaLights> Plague of Bitches
[3:35:47] <@PeachSaliva> I like your good advice. Maybe be nicer to me sometimes. I appreciate u ü•∫
[3:35:51] <gestaltnobody> is there a game you would like remade more than anyting?
[3:35:54] <%Explodincatz> angry skating
[3:35:55] <franctastic_> yes bitch all over us Kreygasm
[3:36:04] <BR0Speedwagon> Also, they make the minigames in V3 significantly less annoying.
[3:36:05] <UrsaDoom> I like happy Plague BibleThump
[3:36:07] <Sokumotanaka> plauge gives good advice?
[3:36:07] <AlarStormbringer> You sound like you're having a really good time shinec2Smile
[3:36:10] <rittergeist> This game sucks
[3:36:23] <ralphwiggum16> I feel like this game was made by someone who also writes disturbing self-insert fanfics with themselves and their favorite band.
[3:36:39] <%Bigchill___> Plague does give good advice!
[3:36:55] <+DeadlyPeaks> Danganronpa is anime to the max & it keeps cranking up the absurdity as the series goes on
[3:36:58] <Spagheddies> @ralphwiggum16 Prior to this, the writer made light novels, so you're not entirely incorrect.
[3:37:07] <ralphwiggum16> I was making a joke.
[3:37:16] <gestaltnobody> is there any game u would like remade?
[3:37:31] <%Bigchill___> I think its because everyone has things they want to complain about in life but can't or wont for some reason. So when they see someone else gets angry at something, they can't vent vicariously through them.
[3:37:34] <Sokumotanaka> Do a 360 nerd
[3:37:43] <%Revan175757> this is by far the worst part of the game. it looks so bad
[3:37:56] <%FingaLights> Bolth
[3:38:01] <ralphwiggum16> I'm having fun.
[3:38:02] <%FingaLights> Don't forget the L
[3:38:02] <AlarStormbringer> snuffPog
[3:38:07] <Spagheddies> Ah, so you didn't piss yourself.
[3:38:08] <Krakenoid> look at this metaphor the investigative process. can't wait till we do a sweet 360 on some known unknowns.
[3:38:13] <%Revan175757> Pee-pee-poo-poo
[3:38:17] <lemoan> @Revan175757 No it's definitely the word shit. Cause that's just an annoying mechanic
[3:38:21] <%Axellogic> @Bigchill___ Vindication
[3:38:42] <%Bigchill___> @Bigchill___ that too
[3:38:48] <%Explodincatz> but of course
[3:38:51] <%Revan175757> @lemoan the word shit gave us Prozd skit, so it was worth something in the end

[3:39:30] <%ZiggySol> Is this a new form of self-flagellation?
[3:39:32] <lemoan> @Spagheddies EVERYONE has selective baby brain in this game
[3:39:33] <%Explodincatz> can u spell alll?
[3:39:33] <Krakenoid> think of the mild logistics! you'd have to run to multiple places!
[3:39:34] <Spagheddies> HE'S GONNA HOPE
[3:39:53] <Samex_Comex> He hoped all over the floor
[3:40:05] <%HawkGoggles2> I'll reach this one specific truth in one go
[3:40:58] <%TheLordOfTheScrubs> have they still not figured out who killed Jack-7?

[3:41:57] <Murphio_GS> so much hope Kreygasm
[3:42:01] <%Revan175757> that sounds kinda sad Eli xD
[3:42:06] <Spagheddies> NO! You can't H O P E yet! The trial hasn't been padded enough!
[3:42:10] <ralphwiggum16> And they say drugs are banned in Japan.

[3:45:38] <lemoan> Baby Gangsta
[3:45:42] <%Revan175757> he also sound like he needs to take a big shit
[3:46:17] <Kkeyf> monokuma says a lot of things
[3:46:58] <Samex_Comex> Rabbit new wife?
[3:47:16] <Murphio_GS> why is he called monokuma anyway
[3:47:19] <%FingaLights> What are those things anyway. What is actually happening.
[3:47:31] <Murphio_GS> he's just one kuma as opposed to Polykuma?

[3:52:57] <mynameiscelestialudenberg> time for the worst mini game in the game
[3:53:23] <Spagheddies> THIS ONE
[3:53:30] <Spagheddies> IT WAS THIS ONE
[3:53:34] <+ReNhoSoft1> huh
[3:53:37] <franctastic_> BUT CAN YOU SPELL IT
[3:53:55] <Spagheddies> I HAD TO GOOGLE THIS ONE
[3:53:57] <%Johnmaddened> """Improved""" Hangman's Gambit
[3:53:59] <%Revan175757> ‚ÄúDeluxe Rooms‚Äù
[3:54:00] <%cosmicleviathan18> varsityPAIN varsityPAIN varsityPAIN
[3:54:05] <+Damie904> rooms
[3:54:10] <%Revan175757> the answer is Deluxe rooms
[3:54:13] <terminusterminal> "(Improved)" Hangman's Gambit
[3:54:25] <CrimsonFox777> Not enough rooms on the guys side
[3:54:38] <Kkeyf> they got to sleep in the better rooms which were insulated and soundproof
[3:54:47] <%Revan175757> yeah, so we give answer cause fuck this
[3:54:50] <%Explodincatz> theres no way u could have remembered this
[3:55:19] <%Revan175757> they trusted only you to be with them
[3:55:25] <lemoan> That fact that we have to do this mini game just becasue Nagito doesn't want to tell people what the fucking answer is is annoying as hell
[3:55:25] <%Revan175757> cause mechanic was a creep
[3:55:26] <%Bigchill___> wasn't it because of the number of rooms and they trusted you
[3:55:33] <%Explodincatz> nor does it get brought up until just this moment
[3:56:34] <lemoan> WHERE'S THE FUCKING O
[3:56:55] <franctastic_> NotLikeThis NotLikeThis NotLikeThis
[3:56:59] <+ReNhoSoft1> wow thats quite the minigame
[3:57:00] <%ZiggySol> Look at that hp
[3:57:05] <+illoonar> aurShock
[3:57:05] <%cosmicleviathan18> that was garbage
[3:57:09] <%Explodincatz> magic pixel
[3:57:11] <%Johnmaddened> worst minigame
[3:57:15] <Spagheddies> Nah, this specific part was a genuine load of bollocks.
[3:57:35] <%Revan175757> neither fucking should you
[3:57:43] <Spagheddies> No, it's literally only mentioned once, and never brought up again.
[3:58:23] <Samex_Comex> Can we just say it was Nagito
[3:58:28] <+TheOverwhelmingShotgun> why is Nagito only dragging things along if he already know the identity of the killer
[3:58:43] <Spagheddies> Because he's a grade A shitter.
[3:58:46] <%cosmicleviathan18> just cap Nagito now ryboogFace LUL
[3:58:56] <lemoan> @TheOverwhelmingShotgun because he's a fucking asshole and the writer thinks he cool by dragging out this fucking game
[3:59:08] <+TheOverwhelmingShotgun> I hate danganronpa
[3:59:40] <DeadWizardpl> LUL
[3:59:43] <CrimsonFox777> AMOGUS
[3:59:53] <%Explodincatz> Susito
[3:59:55] <Dlent_> AMOGUS
[4:00:02] <+ReNhoSoft1> I wanna hear the explanation to this
[4:00:13] <%cosmicleviathan18> Nagito is getting off on this isn't he?
[4:00:18] <%Revan175757> Gundham Tanaka
[4:00:37] <ELLIPZZZthaPROFIT> Who was up when they shouldn‚Äôt have been?
[4:01:40] <Samex_Comex> Did he use the hamsters to change the clocks?
[4:01:48] <%cosmicleviathan18> LUL LUL LUL
[4:01:57] <shiny_prinny> it was me all along
[4:02:03] <DeadWizardpl> Gundham
[4:02:06] <franctastic_> LUL LUL LUL
[4:02:22] <GarbageQueenEllie> Oh look a dangur bangur
[4:02:58] <%FingaLights> He sleeps with his door open
[4:03:20] <lemoan> you can't hear anything from the deluxe room. but gundham said he did. he contradicted himself
[4:03:22] <DeadWizardpl> early morning joga session, the killer tampered with clocks
[4:04:21] <+Maleicus> it makes perfect sense
[4:04:38] <franctastic_> you know I kinda like Nagito's raspy voice
[4:04:49] <DeadWizardpl> nagito wants to get rid of reserve student
[4:05:46] <+Maleicus> what do you mean not necessarily, he was there
[4:06:02] <mynameiscelestialudenberg> damnit i was hoping it wasn't him
[4:06:21] <+jorgamund> well I'm convinced.  Plague is the killer.
[4:06:30] <%KELTHUZAD9999> the hamsters
[4:07:03] <BR0Speedwagon> Then why didn't Nagito hear it?
[4:07:09] <%FingaLights> Or he sleeps with his door open
[4:07:10] <BR0Speedwagon> If that were the case.
[4:07:12] <Dlent_> Yeah, but he already called it a raucous
[4:07:14] <BR0Speedwagon> *
[4:07:15] <+Maleicus> the others heard nothing and was unlikely excuse
[4:07:25] <franctastic_> BibleThump BibleThump BibleThump
[4:07:26] <lemoan> @BR0Speedwagon because he had a deluxe room
[4:07:30] <%TheLordOfTheScrubs> fi gundham said he hear noises from a soundproof room while the others didn't that'd be even more suspcious
[4:07:33] <franctastic_> i hate him
[4:07:35] <%cosmicleviathan18> dezz nutz
[4:07:44] <BR0Speedwagon> @lemoan I know, that was directed at Plagues reasoning.
[4:07:46] <GarbageQueenEllie> Are there any characters  in this series that DON'T look and sound like they're from an asylum?
[4:07:48] <+jorgamund> ...sure buddy
[4:07:52] <BR0Speedwagon> Sleeping with the door slightly open is a good excuse.
[4:07:56] <lemoan> @BR0Speedwagon oh ok
[4:08:13] <SuperVaderMan> I mean, Akane has superhuman hearing. It's come up like 5 times already. This isn't that big of a stretch
[4:08:47] <BR0Speedwagon> That excuse is at least plausible.
[4:09:05] <%cosmicleviathan18> please vote Nagito
[4:09:22] <lemoan> OH MY GOD IF THERE IS ANOTHER TANGET I SWEAR TO GOD!!
[4:09:29] <BR0Speedwagon> Angry at left hand, happy at right.
[4:09:30] <SuperVaderMan> Left haaaand! SMOrc

[4:10:09] <%Revan175757> good question!
[4:10:09] <Spagheddies> Nah jk I don't remember
[4:10:48] <franctastic_> Even Sonia got enough of Gundhamis schtick
[4:11:35] <cap_bon> Has this trail been going on for like an hour now
[4:11:44] <%Revan175757> Plague do you remember about the triangle ability? The one were you make statements into bullets and shoot them into other statements?
[4:11:48] <GarbageQueenEllie> Did Travis Touchdown design this school?
[4:11:50] <%FingaLights> West side story
[4:11:55] <rittergeist> WHEN WILL IT END
[4:12:10] <%Explodincatz> it never ends
[4:12:12] <Samex_Comex> The trap doors from the clown room?

[4:12:32] <franctastic_> NotLikeThis NotLikeThis NotLikeThis
[4:12:34] <SuperVaderMan> Aren't Nagito and the killer the only ones who know about the trapdoor? How are we supposed to do this then
[4:12:35] <%FingaLights> Just like a shrew
[4:12:36] <Tyonidus> Why does that one chick have absolutely honkin boobas
[4:12:43] <lemoan> @xerioes they've been doing that for past 2 hours
[4:12:58] <%cosmicleviathan18> pleasa2Cry
[4:13:03] <%Revan175757> yeah it's not like im asking cause it's relevant right now or anything...
[4:13:18] <flamingkm> big boobs mean bigger power.  she can also hide murder weapons in her cleavage

[4:14:46] <Spagheddies> Nagito don't you fucking H O P E on me right now I swear to god
[4:15:04] <franctastic_> I hate the Start/Finish timer, in the first game it actually was divided for each statement

[4:16:45] <cap_bon> Packet0chan pls
[4:17:15] <flamingkm> what's with all this CLUE infinite multiple murder possibility bs.  how would anybody have such over intricate explanations for murder mystery bs?
[4:17:32] <cap_bon> The main character looks kinda dumpy
[4:17:34] <%Revan175757> just swing violently
[4:17:38] <%caramello_man> It was meant to be done with touch screen
[4:17:39] <ralphwiggum16> Plague, does anime ever made you feel bad?
[4:17:52] <%Revan175757> like you attempting to shit in his mouth
[4:18:00] <Spagheddies> Yeah, this is just violent swinging.
[4:18:38] <flamingkm> omg this mf'er is like that emo poetry kid in high school
[4:18:45] <lemoan> Jesus fucking christ this game is ASS
[4:19:00] <%Revan175757> button mushing on PC is awfull cause of higher frame rate so be aware of that Plague
[4:19:08] <+jorgamund> ah, button mashing, the foundation of rhetoric since the ancient Greeks
[4:19:37] <%Revan175757> "Wire" Sword for "maelstrom of blind confusion"
[4:20:00] <+Mekhet09> I think it's the alarm.
[4:20:06] <Spagheddies> He couldn't have gotten the wire from either of the two houses.
[4:20:21] <%Revan175757> its "Wire" Sword for "maelstrom of blind confusion"
[4:20:21] <+Exicuren> This sword thing just makes me imagine that it's a discussion in which the one who speaks the loudest wins
[4:20:22] <filthywanko> where did he get the wire
[4:20:23] <flamingkm> octagon?  wtf is this mortal kombat?
[4:20:52] <+Mekhet09> oh the wire?
[4:21:32] <cap_bon> He wasnt kidding when he said this guy was exhausting to listen to
[4:21:32] <%FingaLights> Doesn't seem great
[4:21:39] <lemoan> this is torture
[4:21:45] <%Explodincatz> pain
[4:21:46] <GarbageQueenEllie> This game is like adhd and dyslexia all rolled up into one
[4:21:47] <+Mekhet09> I think 3 is way better.
[4:22:03] <xerioes> oh man there need to be a mute option for this repeat daiolouge
[4:22:03] <%FingaLights> How frail, FRAIL I SAY
[4:22:04] <flamingkm> I like how mega milker chick looks like an absolute confused bimbo when confused or surprised
[4:22:12] <%cosmicleviathan18> is this man really using wormholes for his argument?!
[4:22:37] <+Mekhet09> Pause now.
[4:22:46] <+Mekhet09> Yeah.
[4:22:47] <%Revan175757> "Wire" Sword for "maelstrom of blind confusion"
[4:22:59] <Spagheddies> Back to stage one, jesus H christ.
[4:23:06] <%ZiggySol> Your commitment to self-flagellation is impressive
[4:23:15] <flamingkm> this is stupid
[4:23:15] <Murphio_GS> NotLikeThis
[4:23:18] <filthywanko> stop cutting though it
[4:23:19] <SuperVaderMan> do you actually have to slice through the orange word? It's not enough to hit the general statement?
[4:23:30] <%FingaLights> How frail, FRAIL I SAY
[4:23:38] <%Revan175757> you can cut at that part
[4:23:42] <+jorgamund> we'll support you in your strangling
[4:23:53] <flamingkm> the mute button exists and was made by God in this case
[4:23:55] <franctastic_> ALLOW ME TO CUT THROUGH THOSE WORDS
[4:24:00] <%Revan175757> YAY
[4:24:05] <Spagheddies> For whatever's worth, I found this guy equally as insufferable.
[4:24:11] <%Explodincatz> had to slash vertically on it
[4:24:13] <lemoan> thank fucking god
[4:24:15] <%Explodincatz> cause of course

[4:24:45] <franctastic_> nah this is fun
[4:24:47] <%Revan175757> yeah, this game is great when you dont play it says Eli lol

[4:25:03] <lemoan> @SoFarFetched Oh yeah I say it all the time. They don't message back thoguh
[4:25:08] <lol_red_ranger> every argument I've ever had on twitter was jumping through hoops shooting words out of the air what are you talking about
[4:25:19] <Tyonidus> @lemoan the one who does....you know she's the one bro
[4:25:28] <majeser> what is 2+2? and don't say 4 give me a proper answer!!!
[4:25:32] <SoFarFetched> Dangaronpa I feel is definitely a game you can play the series just once and be fine for the rest of your life.
[4:25:40] <lol_red_ranger> THE SUMMARY MUSIC
[4:25:44] <%Revan175757> lol
[4:25:45] <lemoan> NAGITO YOU FUCKING HYPOCRITE

[4:25:57] <franctastic_> go on Nagito H O P E as hard as you can Kreygasm
[4:26:10] <%Explodincatz> hes edged for to long
[4:26:12] <lemoan> @SuperVaderMan oh that's probably still gonna happen
[4:26:18] <SoFarFetched> you just get a small animation of him slapping the panels on
[4:26:19] <SoFarFetched> and they don't stay on
[4:26:26] <Kkeyf> there's a reason why there are no comic panels
[4:26:46] <%Johnmaddened> he stole your big reveal moment lol
[4:26:59] <Murphio_GS> Nagito is hopeposting
[4:27:04] <franctastic_> lmao
[4:27:08] <Tyonidus> So what's the story with this "series"? Was it a show or something first or does it just have the strangest art style ever?

[4:28:16] <%cosmicleviathan18> please finish right now bo8Gasm
[4:28:20] <%FingaLights> I say that all the time
[4:28:21] <SoFarFetched> I CANNOOOOTTTT-gets cut off completely-
[4:28:25] <rittergeist> Gundham seems like the kind of guy that would benefit greatly from getting punched in the fucking face.
[4:28:32] <Spagheddies> Gundham, shut up and die, please and thank you.
[4:28:32] <franctastic_> @SoFarFetched he voiced Abdul in the Jojo Part 3 dub
[4:28:50] <flamingkm> omg he is so much the emo kid that loved poetry in high school
[4:28:55] <KgKid51> so is this the worst trial? it might be
[4:29:00] <Samex_Comex> The fat hamster is the killer
[4:29:08] <%Revan175757> case 5 always the worst
[4:29:12] <SuperVaderMan> That's your big defense? "It's hard to get behind someone"? Wow
[4:29:12] <%Revan175757> in all 3 games
[4:29:18] <Spagheddies> It's really not.
[4:29:20] <franctastic_> I hate this trial specifically because of Gundham
[4:29:21] <BR0Speedwagon> It's really not
[4:29:23] <%Revan175757> NO IT'S THE WORST ONE
[4:29:24] <+Damie904> This is the worst one in the game, who said it's the best?
[4:29:24] <%cosmicleviathan18> it never ends ryboogFace ryboogFace
[4:29:28] <franctastic_> I like the next one
[4:29:32] <%Revan175757> IT'S BORING
[4:29:35] <%Deadbulky> Jebaited
[4:29:38] <+jorgamund> I've done a load of laundry, started dinner, ate dinner, and did some work, and it's STILL going
[4:29:47] <+Damie904> It's annoying on every level. Gameplay, Deductive Reasoning, etc.
[4:29:48] <Dlent_> Everyone says the next is the best. Most people call this one the worst.
[4:29:51] <%Johnmaddened> no the next one is the best one
[4:29:52] <Cyral_Drive> the next one is the best
[4:29:56] <SuperVaderMan> ResidentSleeper
[4:29:58] <Spagheddies> The next one, I kind of like, I kind of hate. But this one genuinely made me want to drop the game.
[4:30:03] <%cosmicleviathan18> overwhelming power bo8Gasm
[4:30:03] <lemoan> Plague, Danganronpa fans are like sonic fans. None of them agree on a single thing. Some think this is the best game
[4:30:06] <%Revan175757> next one is the best one in all of Danganronpa
[4:30:11] <Samex_Comex> It's made me hungry
[4:30:16] <morkelebmink> I have no idea what's going on
[4:30:25] <franctastic_> @Dlent_ the next one has at least an.....interesting twist??
[4:30:25] <flamingkm> is it bad I'm zoning out on big boob lady while emo kid rants?
[4:30:33] <+Mekhet09> This is the end.
[4:30:36] <SoFarFetched> its like a "rhythm" game
[4:30:43] <%Revan175757> just press X in time
[4:30:43] <BR0Speedwagon> @Revan175757 The final one in V3 is stronger.
[4:30:44] <+Damie904> Gundam's a chuuni. 90% of what he says is someone roleplaying as if they're in an isekai or some bullshit.
[4:30:52] <%Revan175757> xbox so its X
[4:30:54] <%FingaLights> LUL
[4:30:54] <Spagheddies> Yeah, it's just a rhythm game.
[4:30:54] <SuperVaderMan> What is happening
[4:31:05] <%cosmicleviathan18> the cadaver is under a ton of rocks LUL
[4:31:17] <+Mekhet09> You can pause. and look.
[4:31:21] <flamingkm> lol old man reflexes
[4:31:22] <+Masked_Hero_Lucky> I don't think you have to match the actual timing, just hold down the button to lock on
[4:31:22] <SoFarFetched> its been soooo long.

[4:33:55] <lol_red_ranger> The Four Bonemeats of Destruction
[4:33:59] <Samex_Comex> Hamtaro is the killer
[4:34:07] <%Explodincatz> the power of Hamtaro
[4:34:12] <SoFarFetched> they have the power of having weeb names
[4:34:22] <%cosmicleviathan18> pain
[4:34:27] <%HawkGoggles2> damn, hamsters got hands
[4:34:34] <Spagheddies> Yeah, no, this trial was shit.
[4:34:38] <%Revan175757> Indeed it was
[4:34:45] <rittergeist> FOUR AND A HALF GODDAMN HOURS!
[4:34:45] <Spagheddies> But, hey, silver lining. At least Gundham is dead.
[4:34:48] <SoFarFetched> I barely remembered this one.
[4:34:48] <+Mekhet09> Yeah but the reasoning makes sense unlike the last trial.
[4:34:53] <%Explodincatz> wait til u see the rest of it
[4:34:57] <flamingkm> Jesus Christ this is so ridiculous
[4:35:02] <%Revan175757> Also remember, trial 5 in first game was ALSO the worst one
[4:35:02] <%cosmicleviathan18> this trial can slip and slide off my taint for all I care bo8Bsmug
[4:35:21] <SuperVaderMan> Are the hamsters going to be executed, too
[4:35:21] <lemoan> @cosmicleviathan18 gonna use that one
[4:35:35] <%Explodincatz> but this is trial 4...
[4:35:58] <SoFarFetched> the ? gives you a hint of what  goes there
[4:36:00] <+Mekhet09> Match.
[4:36:22] <%Revan175757> is this 4? im dumb then xD
[4:36:31] <flamingkm> mf'er admitted it so why put it all together now
[4:36:33] <@PeachSaliva> Hey Eli, what kind of cheese would you be?
[4:36:53] <Dlent_> Bleu
[4:37:03] <%Revan175757> Paige we are almost done, dont distract him pleaeease xD

[4:37:14] <@PeachSaliva> @Revan175757 It's my job! I have a quota!
[4:37:39] <%Revan175757> @PeachSaliva Nuuuuu
[4:37:44] <+Masked_Hero_Lucky> Gundham is nutty
[4:37:52] <glass_marcus> He probably thinks he's immortal
[4:37:53] <lol_red_ranger> do it for the hamsters
[4:37:54] <SuperVaderMan> play russian roulette with his hamsters
[4:38:11] <@PeachSaliva> :(
[4:38:19] <SoFarFetched> she needs to know what cheese would you be
[4:38:26] <+Mekhet09> 3rd one on the first page.
[4:38:28] <SoFarFetched> its very important
[4:38:29] <SoFarFetched> life or death
[4:38:35] <@PeachSaliva> thank u farfetch
[4:38:40] <SoFarFetched> paige WILL die
[4:38:46] <SoFarFetched> if there isnt an answer
[4:38:56] <%Revan175757> of boredom
[4:38:57] <Samex_Comex> 64 slices of American cheese
[4:39:07] <Kkeyf> you're doing great!
[4:39:09] <Spagheddies> For the alarm.
[4:39:11] <@PeachSaliva> @Samex_Comex based
[4:39:12] <Murphio_GS> plague would be goat cheese, maybe
[4:39:17] <+Mekhet09> To switch the alarms.
[4:39:19] <+Mekhet09> back.
[4:39:21] <%Revan175757> alarm to wake up, you forgot Eli
[4:39:24] <+Mekhet09> after he fixed them.
[4:39:25] <%Revan175757> go sleep
[4:39:43] <SoFarFetched> I dont blame eli for forgetting details on this case.
[4:39:59] <SoFarFetched> his mind is currently trying to erase it while he's in the middle of still solving it
[4:39:59] <flamingkm> hamsters are going to prison now I guess.
[4:40:31] <lemoan> @flamingkm prison? Nah everyone dying today
[4:40:34] <DeadWizardpl> go sleep
[4:41:01] <+Mekhet09> dangling.
[4:41:37] <Spagheddies> It's OVER
[4:41:38] <SoFarFetched> brute forced the entire thing
[4:41:39] <%Revan175757> YAY
[4:41:42] <Spagheddies> WE CAN FINALLY HOPE

[4:41:57] <%Explodincatz> gg
[4:41:57] <%Revan175757> Eli Wins!
[4:42:01] <%Axellogic> I actually took a nap like 2 hours ago thinking you were about to stop
[4:42:05] <+DeadlyPeaks> Can‚Äôt believe pat‚Äôs playing me3 & I‚Äôm watching this. Maybe plague is good at this streaming thing
[4:42:07] <%cosmicleviathan18> please let it end
[4:42:08] <SoFarFetched> You're gonna be asking that quite a lot,Eli. I will warn you LUL
[4:42:11] <%Explodincatz> never say that for dangol
[4:42:17] <franctastic_> lets all finish H O P I N G together Kreygasm
[4:42:36] <SuperVaderMan> There's a lot of 'why' in this case
[4:42:47] <%cosmicleviathan18> nice poss LUL
[4:42:51] <%Revan175757> it's 3 am in Russia, oh man am i tired
[4:43:03] <lemoan> @SuperVaderMan That's a lot of "why" in this series
[4:43:05] <%Explodincatz> jojo
[4:43:06] <Dlent_> Gray man has a lot of fun
[4:43:39] <%cosmicleviathan18> cat close up
[4:44:07] <Spagheddies> Well, he did it at ??? and then he ??? to make sure ??? would happen.
[4:44:12] <Samex_Comex> Beep boop beep
[4:44:14] <cap_bon> I assume this trial is the low point of this game/series and the thers are way better
[4:44:23] <lemoan> @cap_bon HA
[4:44:37] <flamingkm> how do you murder a robot anyway
[4:44:39] <lemoan> @cap_bon HAHA...
[4:44:46] <CrimsonFox777> He didn't want to hurt the poor hamsters though.
[4:44:49] <%Revan175757> Apperently
[4:44:49] <Spagheddies> @cap_bon After playing all three, honestly, it kind of is.
[4:44:50] <SoFarFetched> Red eyes mean "IM EVILLL"
[4:44:59] <%cosmicleviathan18> t- posing hamsters
[4:45:01] <flamingkm> lmfao
[4:45:01] <Samex_Comex> Not the hamhams
[4:45:08] <Frogwash> Sucks to be albino in the dangit grandpa universe
[4:45:13] <Gallegor> kzxMonkaTg
[4:45:15] <flamingkm> the hamsters are skaven so it's ok
[4:45:24] <%ZiggySol> They are hamsters, they exist to teach children about mortality
[4:45:29] <xerioes> duffle bag and some water should do it
[4:45:34] <%Explodincatz> F is for fire that burns alll the hamsters
[4:45:39] <SuperVaderMan> There were actual rocket launchers
[4:45:42] <%Revan175757> yeah, but he a bitch so naaah
[4:45:50] <%cosmicleviathan18> @flamingkm LUL LUL LUL
[4:45:56] <Kkeyf> the point is not to get caught
[4:45:57] <flamingkm> ultimate weapon?  WMDs with hamsters?  are these mofo gonna start a war?
[4:45:58] <+jorgamund> what is an RPG, compared to the might of hamster?
[4:46:01] <Samex_Comex> Hell kill everyone
[4:46:01] <%Revan175757> russian roulette too much for bitch Gundam
[4:46:07] <franctastic_> nah too simple
[4:46:08] <%Explodincatz> anthrax lets go!!!
[4:46:14] <+Maleicus> not like it would work on nekomaru
[4:46:32] <%Revan175757> that's too smart Eli
[4:46:40] <Happysobek> "hamster pyre" is the best thing I've ever heard
[4:46:53] <cap_bon> Just pull a Space Station 13 shoot someone from the end of a hallway and walk off
[4:47:06] <filthywanko> but then how would the writers use the "ultimate weapon"?
[4:47:07] <%Revan175757> no, but if you eat them, then he might be impressed
[4:47:10] <Spagheddies> Honestly, Plague, I'm genuinely convinced the only reason people live and die in these games is "Who does the writer like/dislike." Everything else comes later.
[4:47:37] <+Mekhet09> People don't remember 2.
[4:47:38] <%Revan175757> It is actually better tough
[4:47:45] <flamingkm> why is this so convoluted and have such alibis?
[4:47:45] <%ZiggySol> Could you set up a booby trap and just wait a few days for someone to trigger it?
[4:47:47] <UrsaDoom> Jesus, the robot thing is still not over?
[4:47:50] <BigBanterCorbin> i like it better :)
[4:47:53] <%Revan175757> Case 5 is better than all of 1
[4:47:57] <franctastic_> I like 2....towards the end so...yeah
[4:47:59] <%Explodincatz> the games dont get better just more stupid
[4:48:00] <%Revan175757> it's too good
[4:48:10] <Spagheddies> This trial was just genuinely ungraciously shat out into the series with no care or attention.
[4:48:19] <%Johnmaddened> 2 ends great and I think that makes it easier to forget all the bullshit it took to get there
[4:48:27] <+Maleicus> no
[4:48:33] <+Mekhet09> He's in the other house.
[4:48:49] <filthywanko> The hammer was so nobody would know how the entire tower was the weapon IG
[4:49:00] <flamingkm> when taking a crap ruins your convoluted murder plans.  feels bad man
[4:49:30] <%Revan175757> no
[4:49:32] <+Masked_Hero_Lucky> The chain? That was a red herring
[4:49:45] <+Mekhet09> The point is gundham is bad at killing people.
[4:49:52] <flamingkm> sounds like some yuris and yaoi stuff or is this like a boarding school with murderers
[4:49:59] <%Revan175757> red herring
[4:50:02] <vonmaultke> for style points?
[4:50:08] <SoFarFetched> no PILLAR
[4:50:09] <Dlent_> Not intentional, tbh
[4:50:19] <DeadWizardpl> not intentional
[4:50:26] <Dlent_> He couldn‚Äôt control where nekomaru fell
[4:50:28] <cap_bon> Does manslaughter still count as a kill in danganronpa
[4:50:32] <%Revan175757> Eli let's just finish this fucking case xD
[4:50:37] <UrsaDoom> An inhuman pillar?
[4:50:41] <Spagheddies> I'm guessing it wasn't intentional. Not like Gundham could've controlled whether Nekomaru was going to hit the pillar or the floor.
[4:50:47] <%cosmicleviathan18> BuT wHat If yOu RoLLed iT?!
[4:50:51] <Spagheddies> Not that the rest of the plan isn't fucking stupid.
[4:51:00] <+Mekhet09> It doesn't.
[4:51:04] <+Mekhet09> Because he's in the wrong house.
[4:51:08] <+Mekhet09> That's the only reason.
[4:51:15] <Kkeyf> except he's now admitting to it
[4:51:29] <SuperVaderMan> Wouldn't Fuyuhiko be just as culpable, the only thing saying he wasn't was "because it's hard to sneak up on nekomaru" which uhhh
[4:51:41] <+Damie904> "Stop being a chuuni you dumb chuuni!"
[4:52:05] <flamingkm> he's a robot
[4:52:05] <%cosmicleviathan18> ok
[4:52:11] <Spagheddies> Look, this trial was hot trash. But at least Gundham is dead.
[4:52:15] <%Revan175757> Please kill him
[4:52:16] <Spagheddies> Silver Lining.
[4:52:18] <franctastic_> just....quit it..
[4:52:20] <franctastic_> yeah
[4:52:26] <sosuke5> Chuuni to the end
[4:52:27] <franctastic_> drop the act
[4:52:42] <Samex_Comex> The hamsters eat him
[4:52:44] <+lordericter> the vibrating Gundam is pretty funny
[4:52:51] <cap_bon> Just release the Mummy Scarabs
[4:52:58] <franctastic_> SSS
[4:53:03] <flamingkm> who would miss this mf'er?  I'm sure even his parents would thank you
[4:53:03] <%Explodincatz> wow a B
[4:53:06] <franctastic_> SeemsGood SeemsGood SeemsGood
[4:53:07] <UrsaDoom> So why did he kill him?
[4:53:10] <Kkeyf> no matter how he's going to be killed, you're going to be disappointed
[4:53:15] <%Revan175757> B for hot bisexual Eli
[4:53:20] <@Nightbot> Plague is a youtube animator and also streams at https://picarto.tv/Plague . Also: t-shirts! http://goo.gl/lze8QO
[4:53:31] <flamingkm> he wants the D!!!!
[4:53:35] <+lordericter> is this the worst trial so far?  I feel like trial 3 sucked a lot
[4:53:52] <SoFarFetched> no I say this one definitely
[4:54:01] <+lordericter> see you in hell hamster man
[4:54:07] <Spagheddies> This trial is actually fucking shit.
[4:54:23] <filthywanko> If i picked random things without paying attention I'd be bored too
[4:54:33] <Murphio_GS> I guess you can say it was soulless, like a robot
[4:54:42] <+lordericter> yeah at least the Sakura trial had some good story bits even if you had to wrestle the verdict when it was very obvious
[4:54:51] <SoFarFetched> get ready
[4:54:58] <%boltman_37> Congratulations on getting to the end
[4:55:02] <SoFarFetched> geefSmugAF
[4:55:06] <+jorgamund> "but wait!  There's more!"
[4:55:30] <Spagheddies> Some shit about honor, IDFK.
[4:55:40] <SoFarFetched> wait  for it
[4:55:42] <Spagheddies> I don't fucking care either.
[4:55:54] <flamingkm> this teddy bear supposed to belong to Two Face from the Batman series?
[4:55:56] <SoFarFetched> guns have NO HONOR
[4:55:57] <%Explodincatz> his motive is so stupid
[4:56:00] <%Revan175757> nope, cause he is dumb
[4:56:00] <ralphwiggum16> Wait, wasn't he the most obvious guy?
[4:56:02] <Spagheddies> To be hoest, that is entirely on character for this jackass.
[4:56:12] <%cosmicleviathan18> THERE WAS AN RPG, JUST SHOOT HIM WITH IT!!!
[4:56:23] <+Maleicus> rpg wouldnt have worked
[4:56:26] <+Maleicus> we established that
[4:56:42] <franctastic_> even the reasoning in Celeste's trial was better
[4:56:57] <%Revan175757> well Gundam IS the ultimate
[4:57:09] <Spagheddies> F U C C B O I
[4:57:11] <SoFarFetched> its coming
[4:57:13] <Kkeyf> he's too dumb to be deceiving
[4:57:22] <Krakenoid> this bitch too much of an anime for this anime
[4:57:38] <franctastic_> he kills him just cause right?
[4:57:48] <SoFarFetched> yeah he did say they had a staredown
[4:57:52] <SuperVaderMan> ResidentSleeper
[4:57:56] <Krakenoid> they did a jojo battle. time to pose like a motherfucker
[4:58:02] <franctastic_> this is the worst motive
[4:58:07] <%Revan175757> In case you forgot Eli, they were starving there. They had no food at all
[4:58:09] <+mrkisi> @plagueofgripes are you also reviewing/analyzing this game too? I loved your video on the first one
[4:58:09] <SuperVaderMan> So there is no fucking motive, cool
[4:58:12] <Spagheddies> They "fought", and Gundham killed Nekomaru because he's a shit.
[4:58:12] <%Explodincatz> i hate this so much
[4:58:16] <%cosmicleviathan18> LUL LUL LUL
[4:58:18] <%HawkGoggles2> the robo racism is high
[4:58:30] <JeedyJay> That really pretentious kind of fight where they jut stand their and predict each others moves.
[4:58:30] <%cosmicleviathan18> these voice lines
[4:58:42] <flamingkm> lol every time I hate western media and think anime is better things like this remind me of the low depths anime can sink to.
[4:58:45] <Spagheddies> Because he's literally a shit character. Go figure, chuubi is a garbage trope.
[4:58:52] <Spagheddies> *chuuni
[4:59:05] <franctastic_> when I played this case I thought his motive was going to be "my hamsters were fuckin starving" and that would've worked waaay better
[4:59:07] <Spagheddies> He's a breeder.
[4:59:08] <SoFarFetched> BREEDER
[4:59:09] <CrimsonFox777> He breeds animals.
[4:59:12] <+Masked_Hero_Lucky> Animal breeder
[4:59:12] <CrimsonFox777> Kreygasm
[4:59:12] <%Revan175757> Breeder
[4:59:12] <%boltman_37> BREEDER
[4:59:14] <+Mekhet09> He breeds animals.
[4:59:15] <%Revan175757> Furry
[4:59:15] <%Explodincatz> B R E E D E R
[4:59:18] <BR0Speedwagon> Ultimate Breeder
[4:59:19] <+Mekhet09> Who's also a chunni.
[4:59:39] <flamingkm> is the innocent girl like some Christian Alice in wonderland chick
[4:59:42] <+Maleicus> yeah actually
[4:59:47] <+mrkisi> What makes them delusional?
[5:00:06] <+Damie904> Because Monakuma continues putting everyone into horrible situations that make them wanna kill. Unlike the first game, no one chooses to kill each other. They just do it because circumstance says do or die.
[5:00:14] <+Maleicus> no
[5:00:19] <BR0Speedwagon> @flamingkm Sonia? No, she's the "Ultimate Princess".
[5:00:31] <%cosmicleviathan18> bo8Monka bo8Monka bo8Monka
[5:00:38] <Krakenoid> only cool kids do cannibalism
[5:00:38] <%Revan175757> if murder was commited, they were to be given food and released if i remember correctly
[5:00:43] <Spagheddies> You ask me, the only fella that's truly delusional is this chuuni prick.
[5:00:45] <lemoan> @Damie904 that or they're written to be insane at the last minute
[5:00:45] <JeedyJay> "Eat to live, do not live to eat"
[5:00:54] <franctastic_> his motive is lame
[5:00:58] <%HawkGoggles2> we're really running though these logical loops
[5:01:00] <flamingkm> I'm glad this mofo is dying but does he have to make it so dramatic and draw it out for so long
[5:01:07] <+Maleicus> yes
[5:01:09] <%Explodincatz> eat thy neighbor as thy self
[5:01:24] <%Revan175757> if murder was commited, they were to be given food and released if i remember correctly
[5:01:27] <+Damie904> @lemoan Yep, almost every murder in this game happens because the situation forces them too. Not because anyone's so selfish that they want to ordinarily.
[5:01:29] <+jorgamund> I mean really, who doesn't get a little lustful for murder every now and then
[5:01:35] <+Damie904> DR2 is very poorly written.
[5:01:44] <+FadingEmber> I mean this guy would make anyone lustful for murder
[5:01:48] <lemoan> @flamingkm ALL of the characters drag this last part out. Actually this whole game is dragged out but you've seen that
[5:01:48] <+Maleicus> that part was an assumption
[5:01:49] <cap_bon> I mean to be fair listening to this also makes me lustful for murder
[5:01:58] <flamingkm> you know when they say "Any last words" they don't mean for you to draw this shit out for an hour.
[5:02:05] <Spagheddies> @PlagueOfGripes Gundham is so far removed from reality, I just think he's bullshitting, honestly.
[5:02:19] <vindibeard> I'm still thinking about how the robot freaked out when he awoke too, plague :p
[5:02:28] <Spagheddies> Or the writing is just that bad NEVERMIND
[5:02:30] <+Masked_Hero_Lucky> Like it or not he did it to save everyone from starving
[5:02:34] <SuperVaderMan> Oh my god, are we doing this shit again? "This murderer is actually our frieeeend" same as Fuyuhiko? Fuck you game
[5:02:34] <+lordericter> he's just a dipshit murderer who got scared by a rumbly tummy
[5:02:43] <filthywanko> He basically took one for the team
[5:02:46] <SoFarFetched> Heres the stupid thing Plague,if he was THIS willing to unexpectably admit he was the murder. He LITERALLY could have just went up to them and go "so hey I murdered nekomaru so you guys can leave"
[5:02:55] <lol_red_ranger> no way he did it so everyone wouldn't starve
[5:02:59] <franctastic_> Gundham could've said "my pets are starving and dying" and he would've won immediatly
[5:03:01] <SoFarFetched> he had them go through the trial for NO reason if he was just going to admit he did it anyway.
[5:03:06] <+Damie904> @SoFarFetched That means breaking kayfabe
[5:03:13] <Spagheddies> Because she has the hots for him, or some shit.
[5:03:15] <flamingkm> can we per on this guy's grave?
[5:03:20] <flamingkm> pee
[5:03:30] <+Damie904> And Gundham wont every break his chuuni bullshit
[5:03:39] <SoFarFetched> "YES IT WAS MEEE WHO DID IT" "so.....why are we doing this trial if you're just admitting it?"
[5:03:44] <+lordericter> shut up and die idiot
[5:04:00] <+Mekhet09> A chunni to the end.
[5:04:03] <+Tanglerat> Well at least he was commited to the bit
[5:04:04] <CrimsonFox777> STAMPEDE
[5:04:26] <flamingkm> tf?
[5:04:36] <+lordericter> should have just killed himself and made it look like murder if he wanted to save everyone
[5:04:54] <flamingkm> he went out just like Sinbad dad from the lion king
[5:04:57] <cap_bon> Frame chan why now
[5:05:00] <flamingkm> simbas
[5:05:13] <franctastic_> BibleThump BibleThump BibleThump BibleThump
[5:05:14] <%cosmicleviathan18> feast on him hamsters
[5:05:17] <%HawkGoggles2> what is this bit?
[5:05:18] <SuperVaderMan> Yes, lift the murderer to animal heaven
[5:05:20] <+Damie904> The idea is Gundham was actually magic
[5:05:22] <+Masked_Hero_Lucky> Who knows?
[5:05:22] <CrimsonFox777> TBAngel
[5:05:24] <+Damie904> yes it's stupid
[5:05:25] <+ratchetex> no he does not deserve to go to heaven wtf
[5:05:38] <lemoan> @SoFarFetched It's actually upsetting how many caases could be solved if the killer just admitted it from the start instead of the very end
[5:05:41] <flamingkm> So the hamsters are gonna die of starvation in the desert now?
[5:05:51] <+Mekhet09> Yes.
[5:05:55] <UrsaDoom> God hates robots
[5:06:14] <%cosmicleviathan18> THROW ME!!!
[5:06:27] <flamingkm> lol
[5:06:32] <Krakenoid> but most importantly remember that cannibalism is cool
[5:06:33] <SuperVaderMan> Yeah, like, if the idea is he was taking the fall for them, he'd just admit it. Because he didn't, that means he's a liar too
[5:06:33] <flamingkm> don't we all wish
[5:06:40] <filthywanko> I think you misunderstood his intentions, ans didnt pay attention or think about anything during the trial. I dont think we'd be missing out on much if you did make a video on this game
[5:06:49] <lemoan> THEY ARE ACTAULLY MORE UPSET ABOUT GUNDAM BEING GONE THAN NEKOMARU
[5:07:01] <%Explodincatz> when the motivation is garbage its so bad
[5:07:02] <+Mekhet09> Sadly the reasoning made sense but it was awful.
[5:07:06] <Spagheddies> @lemoan Deadass, though.
[5:07:13] <filthywanko> *if you didnt make a video
[5:07:20] <%Revan175757> gundam is boring and dead. good riddance
[5:07:34] <cap_bon> IDK having a shitty unlikable character with no redeeming qualities seems like a bad idea in a game like this.
[5:07:36] <Spagheddies> @Revan175757 A-and I don't want to understate this-MEN
[5:07:56] <+Mekhet09> She's snapped.
[5:08:13] <lemoan> @filthywanko This game really isn't worth the time.
[5:08:24] <Murphio_GS> And no one cared after he died
[5:08:26] <%Revan175757> a boring ending to a boring case
[5:08:32] <%cosmicleviathan18> Wait that was the end of the game?!
[5:08:34] <LegendCasqueD> I absolutely did not like Gundham. He is incredibly annoying.
[5:08:43] <JeedyJay> @cap_bon It works when the shitty character dies early enough
[5:08:44] <lemoan> @Murphio_GS "Oh NO! Gundam's DEAD...so anyway..."
[5:08:58] <DeadWizardpl> No
[5:08:58] <+lordericter> hey wait
[5:09:02] <+lordericter> the logo on that book
[5:09:06] <+lordericter> that's familiar
[5:09:14] <franctastic_> PogChamp
[5:09:18] <flamingkm> So death note?
[5:09:21] <cap_bon> @cap_bon True I guess shitty character dying first to prove how dangerous the situation is important LUL
[5:09:39] <%cosmicleviathan18> H O P E bo8Gasm bo8Gasm bo8Gasm
[5:10:15] <LegendCasqueD> Also hot take - Monokuma is a garbage character.
[5:10:25] <flamingkm> what's with these effeminate dudes anime seems to like so much like in yu gi oh
[5:10:38] <%boltman_37> SUS
[5:10:41] <CrimsonFox777> SUS
[5:10:44] <+lordericter> yeah Byakuya Togami
[5:10:47] <Dlent_> SUS
[5:10:47] <%Revan175757> AMONGUS
[5:10:53] <Murphio_GS> Byakya
[5:11:10] <filthywanko> @lemoan I respectfully disagree
[5:11:12] <lemoan> @LegendCasqueD That's not a hot take. He's not a character. He's a mascot. And he's annoying.
[5:11:18] <Spagheddies> Monokuma isn't good, nor fun, nor entertaining. He's barely even tolerable.
[5:11:22] <%cosmicleviathan18> it's a document of just hands
[5:11:25] <franctastic_> OH YEAH I CAN H O P E TO THIS FILE Kreygasm
[5:11:43] <%cosmicleviathan18> r/handrate
[5:11:48] <Spagheddies> The only reason you put up with him is because you cannot get rid of him.
[5:11:59] <LegendCasqueD> @lemoan Still garbage the series would be better without.
[5:12:05] <flamingkm> wasn't there at least one other series like this game series?
[5:12:37] <lemoan> @LegendCasqueD true. but it also wouldn't EB danganronpa without him...egh
[5:12:55] <LegendCasqueD> It'd be better.
[5:12:58] <Spagheddies> HE'S GONNA HOPE
[5:13:02] <flamingkm> wow what a jerk
[5:13:06] <franctastic_> Kreygasm
[5:13:30] <%cosmicleviathan18> this man and his hope and stepladders ryboogFace
[5:13:38] <Spagheddies> H O P E M A N
[5:13:43] <flamingkm> omg these 2 should shut up
[5:13:44] <%Explodincatz> I now know how plague feels when he streams Star Trek
[5:14:10] <+Mekhet09> The despair and hope is the worst part of the game.
[5:14:15] <flamingkm> this is fun to make fun of plague is fun and boobs are fun but Jesus the incoherent rambling
[5:14:19] <BR0Speedwagon> Nagito's name is an anagram
[5:14:23] <franctastic_> yeh
[5:14:53] <+jorgamund> hey it's a Gantz wheel
[5:15:21] <+lordericter> yeah 7 left after trial 4
[5:15:22] <franctastic_> that was fun
[5:15:35] <Samex_Comex> Freedom!
[5:15:37] <%cosmicleviathan18> that trial was pain
[5:15:37] <+lordericter> how many were alive at the end of game 1, 5?
[5:15:39] <DeadWizardpl> good night
[5:15:40] <Aceofhearts87> Nagito and the main character of the first one do have the same voice actor
[5:15:40] <%Revan175757> Save and let's go to sleep :D
[5:15:46] <%Bigchill___> Thanks Eli
[5:15:49] <LegendCasqueD> Anyway bye now.

[5:15:51] <franctastic_> catjam
[5:15:53] <+Mekhet09> Well the best part about this is that you never have to think about gundham ever again.
[5:15:53] <BR0Speedwagon> Not nice
[5:15:54] <lemoan> WOW that was terrible. I'm sorry plague
[5:15:58] <%Explodincatz> understandable
