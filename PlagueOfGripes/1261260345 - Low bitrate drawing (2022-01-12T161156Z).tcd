[0:08:48] <cartakus> He looks good
[0:08:56] <g_w_stalker> it's a lot cuter... though it does miss that grumpy feel...
[0:08:59] <kookaburragangwar> Holy shit thats cute
[0:08:59] <%legioned247> I want to hug it
[0:09:17] <Tiny_Axolotl> Caracal?

[0:11:44] <+SkookumHime> good morning plague!
[0:11:49] <%lemoan> @cosmicleviathan18 not even a hot take nowadays. Even fans admit that they've gotten stale
[0:11:57] <+SkookumHime> skooku2Wave
[0:12:43] <+SkookumHime> me every time I draw after some time away. "come on hand, move"
[0:12:43] <%Bigchill___> Hello, Eli plagueWave
[0:13:14] <%boatzndhoez> plagueSad aahw thought it might be a FF7 stream
[0:13:15] <eirikoala> @plagueofgripes I have to get back to work. Nic says he‚Äôs glad your doing okay as he falls asleep lol bitterEri bitterHug
[0:13:17] <nejtcq> Was this the remaster's Adjudicator theme?
[0:13:17] <+SkookumHime> plagueLove
[0:13:31] <g_w_stalker> have you ever though of getting into game design? nothing too serious, even just rpg maker stuff
[0:13:37] <%cosmicleviathan18> @lemoan oh really? I've been out of the Pokemon loop for a while
[0:14:00] <%lemoan> Any plans to play FF7 again? I love your gripes but it also nice to see you actually enjoying something and being close to "nostalgic" for you.
[0:14:00] <MorriSnek> Have you eaten recently? I get a little shaky when my blood sugar gets low.
[0:14:07] <technodribble> Could be that you're muscles are tired from yesterday?
[0:14:32] <%GardenHills> GardenHills subscribed with Prime. They've subscribed for 12 months! ‚ù§Ô∏è
[0:14:57] <%kyh9> FF9 sure is good, just beat it for the first time this week
[0:15:14] <+SkookumHime> that was the cutest thing I have ever heard skooku2LOVE
[0:15:26] <%lemoan> @cosmicleviathan18 yeah Sword and Shield was the most devisive game in a while. Had long time fans coming to realize that maybe Gamefreaks had been cheaping out.
[0:15:35] <%arkv01> never heard this before
[0:15:35] <+Mekhet09> tbh 20% dropped frames wasn't noticable.
[0:15:48] <%arkv01> doesn't sound like uematsu at all
[0:15:59] <$JobbedBone> funkish slums feel
[0:16:10] <%arkv01> like the rest of midgar sounds so grungy
[0:16:25] <+ErrorinBluescreen> the lack of preload is moronic
[0:16:54] <%legioned247> kitty
[0:17:06] <+SkookumHime> omg the kitty!!!!
[0:17:07] <%Bigchill___> plagueNYA
[0:17:08] <%boatzndhoez> Will the new cat have full body motions or is it kinda the same but with better face movement?
[0:17:09] <MorriSnek> Inscryption has been my game obsession lately.

[0:18:35] <JacklongKondur> o.o kitten
[0:18:49] <BoneSkore> Been wondering what kinds of traditional art you enjoy doing Plague? Do you like to paint or anything? Have you considered doing some traditional stuff to upload while your internet is hobbled?
[0:19:05] <+SkookumHime> can't wait for the finish product of your new avatar
[0:19:17] <$JobbedBone> my grandma would get up every morning and so these jack lalanne exercises for every part of herself. Never understood until I was 30 LUL
[0:19:47] <%Axza95> We are, all of us, our own biggest critiques. And should we fail in that, we may have failed ourselves.
[0:19:54] <askeladd99> plagueNYA
[0:19:58] <JacklongKondur> u throw things? @.@
[0:19:59] <%Bigchill___> plagueNYA
[0:20:08] <$JobbedBone> the facial ones were the most fun to watch
[0:20:08] <YF23> doo-dooroodoo
[0:20:10] <BoneSkore> Oh! I wouldn't have guessed pottery but that's really cool!
[0:20:13] <%cosmicleviathan18> Gripes, doing something physical? No way!
[0:20:17] <BossBigTeef> @PlagueOfGripes any plans of patreon stuff or has the internet issues threw everything in the air?
[0:20:26] <%mountain_megatherium> Ceramics was fun at Rock college.
[0:20:53] <%boatzndhoez> oh no, is the stream dying?
[0:20:58] <g_w_stalker> oh? did the internet just crash?
[0:20:59] <%arkv01> yes
[0:21:04] <%boatzndhoez> damnit

[0:21:24] <+SkookumHime> stream bumps
[0:21:37] <%Axza95> That bowl reminds me of flowers a bit
[0:21:42] <%cosmicleviathan18> oh love this song bo8Jamming bo8Jamming bo8Jamming
[0:21:51] <cartakus> IF
[0:21:52] <%boatzndhoez> thats a neat bowl eli
[0:21:53] <g_w_stalker> it's lagging quite a bit... the audio seems fine though
[0:22:10] <%lemoan> 240p STREAM LET'S GOOOOOO
[0:22:10] <%Axza95> yea, audio is fine
[0:22:13] <+Payatann> Noice
[0:22:20] <%arkv01> I hope they're lubing the pipes up
[0:22:22] <%arkv01> or replacing them
[0:22:23] <+SkookumHime> internet chan, you can do it
[0:22:28] <BoneSkore> I like that, the blue part looks cool! Is that like an enamel or something?
[0:22:40] <Tiny_Axolotl> I live in a poorer country then you, and even I have better internet then you XD
[0:22:43] <ed_campion> Glaze looks great
[0:22:44] <handsinsand> O what's with this plate?
[0:23:06] <%Axza95> Anyways wanted to stop by and say hi, gotta head out and take care of business. Love all your work even if you may not sometimes xD
[0:23:07] <Badlangug> 160p is an option
[0:23:33] <%arkv01> but morning is when all your local farmers are doing their zoom meetings
[0:23:37] <SadisticAphid60> new kirby
[0:23:56] <+SkookumHime> never have had the change to do thrown pottery but I do love sitting down and sculpting
[0:24:05] <+SkookumHime> the chance. my brain
[0:24:57] <Tiny_Axolotl> Why does RedLetterMedia follow you? did you interact with them before?
[0:25:14] <g_w_stalker> I know what you mean, one time I saw someone loose control of their pot and have it fly directly into their face
[0:25:20] <%vehementvadr> vehementvadr subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 3 months! hiya plague! fun fact! did you know that rock monitor lizard is the second longest lizard on the continent of Africa?
[0:25:37] <+SkookumHime> thats a big lizard
[0:25:44] <Coystick> They think your girls are pretty
[0:25:53] <cartakus> why rock monitor?
[0:26:08] <Schuhart> Also old man Dan Wilson who owns Iowas largest wildlife preserve
[0:26:16] <%legioned247> vagrant story is a beautiful game even today
[0:26:18] <Coystick> Think you'll ever go back to it?
[0:26:27] <Tiny_Axolotl> Sorry for reminding you :(
[0:26:38] <guakomo> ah yes the Likewaan.
[0:26:39] <technodribble> Awww that's unfortunate
[0:26:41] <%boatzndhoez> can we help D:
[0:26:44] <+SkookumHime> which Iowa reserve cause I've been to a few in Iowa
[0:27:10] <+Mekhet09> it's not something you can just pick back up?
[0:27:18] <g_w_stalker> what do you think about where you are now? satisfied for now?
[0:27:52] <Schuhart> @SkookumHime Plague animated a skit by RLM where they prank-call a dead phone number and pretend being a crazy old man who owns a wildlife preserve
[0:27:57] <+SkookumHime> no one wants to do inbetweens, every wants to do key frames
[0:28:19] <@Nightbot> Plague is a youtube animator and also streams at https://picarto.tv/Plague . Also: t-shirts! http://goo.gl/lze8QO
[0:28:32] <g_w_stalker> in betweens can be fun, smear frames are awesome in my opinion
[0:28:51] <+SkookumHime> @schuhart that makes sense xD pardon my uncaffeinated brain
[0:28:58] <Samex_Comex> My kitty is watching you draw
[0:29:58] <Mathochism> Ooooh. Disco Elysium OST.
[0:30:09] <Schuhart> Plague-Town is a go
[0:30:23] <+MKUltima> Just run an ethernet cable to that house
[0:30:23] <+SkookumHime> time to move
[0:30:53] <g_w_stalker> internet seems to be working for now actually, haven't had any problems for quite a few minutes, or at least I haven't
[0:31:03] <+InhumanMilitia> anything can be a stupid reason lol
[0:31:08] <technodribble> if it makes sense, then do it
[0:31:19] <+SkookumHime> I dunno, seems reasonable to me
[0:31:31] <jowi_time> it depends, how much more can you get done with the better internet?
[0:31:41] <Tiny_Axolotl> Plague Street?
[0:31:42] <TechGFennec> Is it a rare or a common name?
[0:32:12] <%boatzndhoez> You ever considered weed Plague ?
[0:32:34] <g_w_stalker> should check if the neighbors are nice though, if they are noisy neighbors then it might be worse for the streams
[0:32:48] <%boatzndhoez> plagueSad damn
[0:33:04] <jowi_time> oh! I hope he gets better buffpupCry
[0:33:09] <afraidanuffin> @boatzndhoez Sounds like more stress than it's worth given it's legal status given Plague's location
[0:33:28] <%legioned247> I so sorry to hear that
[0:33:35] <+Seancicle> he heard about them on AM radio
[0:33:43] <%boatzndhoez> @boatzndhoez oh right , cant keep track of which states allow it
[0:33:46] <cartakus> oh his opinions did not change?
[0:33:57] <%legioned247> I hope he recovers
[0:34:00] <jowi_time> the oils?
[0:34:02] <Tiny_Axolotl> He should watch Alex Jones or something
[0:34:04] <%Heart0fInk> "The weed stuff"
[0:34:05] <+Seancicle> Eli DeMayo
[0:34:06] <MorriSnek> CBT oil?

[0:35:01] <%Heart0fInk> I actually don't know who that is..
[0:35:04] <afraidanuffin> Can't tell until you draw the chest
[0:35:07] <+SkookumHime> me neither. brain is not there yet either
[0:35:07] <g_w_stalker> I am uncultured so.. no
[0:35:08] <Lusifee_> Yocci
[0:35:09] <marklarphd> That's what Elon Musk said and he didn't even inhale
[0:35:15] <+illoonar> The german oni V-Tuber
[0:35:31] <jowi_time> awww
[0:35:37] <%Heart0fInk> But you're pretty already plague.
[0:35:43] <jowi_time> it looks like a plushie
[0:35:47] <+StormingRLP> That's pretty adorable.
[0:35:48] <cartakus> Don't know that one
[0:36:14] <+SkookumHime> I feel you are very presentable
[0:36:17] <+StormingRLP> Cats can be handsome, Plague.
[0:36:19] <%Dakuu75> too cute for my taste but, there's nothing functionally wrong with the skills you applied
[0:36:21] <cartakus> It looks adorable
[0:36:24] <marklarphd> your avatar looks pretty good now that your tracking is working
[0:36:35] <MorriSnek> Guys can be both desirable and cut/beautiful.
[0:36:38] <g_w_stalker> I kind of like this avar a bit better, I feel like the more grumpy expression fits you better... also you are adorable
[0:36:46] <+spacetimewithspaceguy_> have you thought of doing a tiger girl for year of the tiger?
[0:36:56] <%legioned247> but you are cat man
[0:37:03] <+Mekhet09> guys can be cute too.
[0:37:26] <%legioned247> plagueLove plagueLove plagueLove
[0:37:33] <%legioned247> same
[0:37:35] <+SkookumHime> RBF?
[0:37:48] <Samex_Comex> My kitty got on the keyboard and hit the sleep button on my keyboard....
[0:37:49] <%Heart0fInk> I'm only fuckin 30 and i have resting depressed face.

[0:38:01] <%legioned247> I do not leave my house
[0:38:01] <%boatzndhoez> honestly you look great for your age, you should just get HUGE plagueHeh
[0:38:14] <Tiny_Axolotl> Did you have what's called "Resting Bitch Face"? or Poker Face?
[0:38:21] <%legioned247> unless I have too
[0:38:27] <Coystick> Ban women from the internet
[0:38:29] <marklarphd> Does this mean your next avatar will have big titties?
[0:38:37] <%legioned247> chocobo jam
[0:38:39] <%Dakuu75> <-- resting bitch face
[0:38:56] <%boatzndhoez> Most people cant afford the expensive ones that look different
[0:38:57] <+Seancicle> J'aime "resting concerned face"
[0:39:03] <MorriSnek> I like Scarra's chubby dragon avatar.
[0:39:11] <TechGFennec> Hair and eye colour is all you need
[0:39:13] <%mountain_megatherium> You need to find more guy vtubers.
[0:39:19] <Badlangug> resting cat face
[0:39:24] <TechGFennec> Anime is face blindness simulator sometimes
[0:39:26] <%legioned247> resting human face
[0:39:28] <+theRx_> ztbUwU <- Handsome
[0:39:41] <MorriSnek> HypeSquawk <- Handsome
[0:39:51] <MorriSnek> Resting bird face
[0:40:01] <%Dakuu75> doodScrub <-- Handsome
[0:40:13] <+SkookumHime> there is a lot of guys with animal or wacky/goofy avatars too. its go one way or the other
[0:40:28] <Coystick> If I were to do a mantuber, I'd go a Master Roshi/fat Max Payne in an aloha shirt type man
[0:40:29] <%boatzndhoez> whats it called :O ?
[0:40:29] <%legioned247> plagueGripes<- Handsome Dan mr dam son
[0:40:34] <%lemoan> my default expression with my eyebrows tends to make me look angry
[0:40:41] <Samex_Comex> Seymour and his treasure trail gut
[0:40:52] <afraidanuffin> Wash face, moisturize, trim beard
[0:40:57] <+OffbeatMinority> plague! I love ya!
[0:40:59] <%Dakuu75> You're going through X-man puberty and getting your powers
[0:41:23] <cartakus> Tired from work days?
[0:41:33] <TheAntiNihilist> skin moisturizing?

[1:29:38] <Mathochism> Disco Elysium: What if we removed the combat from Planescape?
[1:29:50] <%ShadBo> What up Plague. Your art gripes were partially responsible for me picking up a pen and teaching myself to art.
[1:29:57] <WornyTheHun> I would recognize it
[1:30:00] <%octotasty> @Mathochism You get a better game, apparently
[1:30:12] <%ShadBo> Thank you for helping me find new ways to suffer.
[1:30:35] <%Heart0fInk> It has """COMBAT"""
[1:30:36] <Mathochism> @kingkrampus Yet this stream doesn't have the furry tag. Very sus. juicepG
[1:31:20] <Coystick> The "combat" system in Tides of Numanera is interesting as far as narrative driven games go, it's not quite combat, but you can fuck up a guy.
[1:31:36] <kaoseart> But you are super cute kitty person
[1:31:40] <%octotasty> After hours of practicing 3D art, the word Geometry doesn't really have a the same meaning to me anymore

[1:33:58] <+Mekhet09> neither.
[1:34:02] <marklarphd> Why do vtubers have long necks?
[1:34:10] <%octotasty> there is a choice, but the other choice is suffering
[1:34:37] <+KiwiRedgrave> none of us do.
