[0:25:58] <zmuno> to beauty
[0:26:02] <+Yokuho> Demon's souls Obviously
[0:26:14] <EuropanLamprey> >medieval combat and life simulator
[0:26:23] <EuropanLamprey> But isn't that just Dark Souls? :P
[0:26:30] <Daba_mk2> or boring like black desert
[0:26:31] <Coystick> Dark Souls 3's character creator was surprisingly solid.
[0:26:41] <spitfire___> prison gal
[0:26:42] <+fingalights> Bald is fine too
[0:26:49] <ConfusedCultist> @EuropanLamprey Oh you :P
[0:26:50] <yodajr99> buzz cut
[0:27:09] <softpinch_lightslap> Ive never tried this game, how's the combat? Moudhau/Kingdomecome: Deliverance style?
[0:27:12] <Daba_mk2> mine is like that feels bad man
[0:27:30] <EuropanLamprey> Dark Souls 2 and 3 have difficult Character Creators that you actually have to master t in order to make a human being, but once you do, you can make great characters
[0:27:38] <Coystick> Give her big pouty Princess Peach lips
[0:27:39] <Daba_mk2> a noble goal tbh
[0:27:40] <approachingdeath> Fallout 4 has a good character creator and you got to see your character often, but it came at the cost of shit dialogue and voice acting
[0:27:40] <+polypolipauli> Holy shit, it's out!
[0:27:43] <wagasez> OOOH, thats right! You know how to draw, now it makes sense
[0:27:44] <theaudacityofthisb> Eli, have you thought about doing a video on difficulty in video games?
[0:27:51] <+fingalights> Did they change combat in 2? I bounced off 1 partially cause of it

[0:28:13] <+anhero64> thats a sharp scalp
[0:28:29] <Coystick> Maybe I zoom in
[0:28:32] <malickaistorm> boi she thicc
[0:28:33] <EuropanLamprey> I always thin my characters lips
[0:28:52] <%criticalinked> less horrifying
[0:28:53] <+fingalights> Better than I thought,
[0:28:55] <%VashSyndicate> leave her bald
[0:28:55] <+corrosivePaladin> It looks like its slowly turning into a lady
[0:28:57] <EuropanLamprey> Don't worry plague, I do the same thing
[0:29:01] <Coystick> >tfw no bannerlord tomboy gf

[0:29:19] <mighty1> your doing a good job plague
[0:29:20] <GMKGoat> Looks better than most of the characters I make
[0:29:21] <softpinch_lightslap> Demon's Souls made a fucia colored character in game but perfect look in the creator
[0:29:25] <spitfire___> I thought she was cute
[0:29:28] <conchubar11> How long do you think Paru will keep making Beastars, Plague:
[0:29:31] <Peculiar_Pangolin> She doesn't look as inbred now
[0:29:32] <+anhero64> i also kinda liked the vanilla lady :(
[0:29:33] <yodajr99> pointy chin

[0:31:35] <digitaljeff> Bald look is best look
[0:31:37] <ConfusedCultist> Hair styles actually look good
[0:31:43] <%laserbeaming> I don't believe this game is real
[0:31:45] <digitaljeff> Embrace the Woolie
[0:31:45] <yodajr99> that ponytail looks like anime mom
[0:31:45] <%criticalinked> no pompodour?
[0:31:52] <Coystick> Alien 3 gave me a brief taste for buzzcuts on women.
[0:32:02] <digitaljeff> Same with JI Jane
[0:32:09] <%criticalinked> I've always liked side braids
[0:32:17] <Artista_AF> They have freaking Braids! tovgPOG
[0:32:19] <snipsnoopyouvebeendooped> there's always the "afro" or like the "spike hair" that make me upset
[0:32:31] <+anhero64> mount and trade 2 butterlord
[0:32:34] <digitaljeff> Woolie is sad
[0:32:39] <Coystick> The Woolie cut
[0:32:43] <digitaljeff> Hill and Dagger
[0:32:48] <Commissar_Cornflakes> Twintails?

[0:33:03] <korperalkavage> The Landlord's daughter from Spider-Man hairstyle
[0:33:07] <yodajr99> me too
[0:33:09] <digitaljeff> Bible Black gave me a side ponytail fetish
[0:33:26] <Coystick> I like that middle fro
[0:33:31] <Commissar_Cornflakes> THAT'S the fetish it gave you?
[0:33:33] <%Triblade1992> Plague hates that hairstyle that Mitsuru from Demon Slayer has
[0:33:38] <+EpicBigchill> Go bald
[0:33:39] <%laserbeaming> I like the Braided Mohawk
[0:33:40] <Coystick> m i d d l e f r o
[0:33:40] <EuropanLamprey> Single Braid
[0:33:41] <asurite_warrior> that looks like my grandmas hair. She's really white
[0:33:41] <%criticalinked> side braids has my vote
[0:33:43] <malickaistorm> The mohawk tial looks good
[0:33:46] <$doomp12> bottom right reminds me of my grandma
[0:33:46] <+corrosivePaladin> gingers not allowed
[0:33:47] <mizamar> i like second row last
[0:33:47] <softpinch_lightslap> Manage it with 2 cans of 80's mom hairspray
[0:33:48] <+Vestillion> black people hair is the bane of Game devs
[0:33:48] <+fingalights> Red hair?
[0:33:48] <FirmarTheTrilby> No Pat women.
[0:33:49] <digitaljeff> Delicious brown with white hair
[0:33:52] <malickaistorm> gives her a viking look
[0:33:53] <Daksaysso> Big ponytail, next to the big fro!
[0:33:58] <Coystick> Ginger middle fro
[0:33:58] <yodajr99> ponytail is my favorite
[0:33:58] <Commissar_Cornflakes> Side ponytail.
[0:33:58] <Daba_mk2> Rip gingers
[0:33:59] <EuropanLamprey> No Pat's and Paiges
[0:34:03] <GMKGoat> No gingers in the 1400s
[0:34:07] <+fingalights> The gingers were killed off
[0:34:12] <%Triblade1992> No gingers allowed. They don't exist, they are a myth
[0:34:18] <+anhero64> middle fro looks nice
[0:34:18] <Peculiar_Pangolin> Over the shoulder ponytail is nice
[0:34:20] <digitaljeff> RIP ginger squad

[0:34:23] <Daba_mk2> i like 7
[0:34:23] <%Triblade1992> - every corporate hollywood executive ever
[0:34:25] <Coystick> A fro is menacing
[0:34:27] <malickaistorm> RAWR
[0:34:29] <Tasetsu> 4 id say
[0:34:32] <GMKGoat> Over the shoulder ponytail is dead mom hair
[0:34:39] <gunsrlove> shaved and tied dreads is practical
[0:34:48] <+EpicBigchill> TBH tho
[0:34:50] <EuropanLamprey> Plague loves his virtual barbies
[0:34:52] <%laserbeaming> The ol Jeanne D'Arc always works
[0:34:55] <+anhero64> to be tbh
[0:34:56] <$daveronald> then your a liar otherwise
[0:34:57] <derap41> Just jumped in are there titty settings?
[0:35:05] <Commissar_Cornflakes> One you've got's fine.
[0:35:09] <Commissar_Cornflakes> 7.
[0:35:14] <TheWallowingWeeb> 7
[0:35:15] <Daba_mk2> 7
[0:35:17] <digitaljeff> 1
[0:35:18] <Coystick> Team 19 sound off...pls

[0:35:21] <Peculiar_Pangolin> 2 or 7
[0:35:23] <Daksaysso> 17!
[0:35:23] <FirmarTheTrilby> 7
[0:35:26] <+anhero64> 19!
[0:35:27] <%criticalinked> column 1- row 3 is good
[0:35:28] <+EpicBigchill> 1 is the best
[0:35:30] <zmuno> 17
[0:35:31] <%laserbeaming> Is this a combat lady?
[0:35:32] <spitfire___> 14
[0:35:35] <%JailShmixRemix> 22
[0:35:37] <TheWe4pon> 6/7
[0:35:40] <%JailShmixRemix> *20
[0:35:40] <digitaljeff> uno
[0:35:40] <derap41> 17 is nice
[0:35:43] <%PlebianNoob> 15
[0:35:48] <yodajr99> 6 or 7 imo
[0:35:48] <EuropanLamprey> Is 12 the single braided pony tail down the back? Cause that's my favorite
[0:35:48] <trianglehat> what's 14 like?
[0:35:50] <Coystick> argh
[0:36:05] <derap41> Though it would rest on the shoulders :(
[0:36:12] <%JailShmixRemix> 20 and 12
[0:36:15] <brizzi_barks_in_the_chat> i say no bangs is an acquired taste
[0:36:17] <ConfusedCultist> 7 Is really good
[0:36:18] <Commissar_Cornflakes> Plague's being consistent. He hated the pulled-back hair hologram in Doom Eternal, too. :V
[0:36:18] <EuropanLamprey> No it's 6
[0:36:22] <+Vestillion> bangs with your ponytail is pure 70's girl vibe
[0:36:24] <derap41> Yeah that is nice
[0:36:26] <derap41> I like that
[0:36:35] <+Punishedkaiger> Number 3 and 4 are the best of the bunch for this character
[0:36:43] <GMKGoat> anti-paige propaganda
[0:36:47] <spitfire___> redheads are never true either
[0:36:51] <+anhero64> no pale ginger with max fro :(
[0:36:52] <TheWe4pon> no irish faction?
[0:36:56] <Coystick> The bitch style
[0:36:58] <%Triblade1992> Western developers 90% of the time believe red haired people are a myth. They are just stand ins for Black people
[0:37:11] <brizzi_barks_in_the_chat> is there a story behind that?
[0:37:11] <Commissar_Cornflakes> 3 or 7, leaning 7.
[0:37:12] <zmuno> shit... that woman really hurt you
[0:37:13] <yodajr99> redheads couldn't survive in this game
[0:37:15] <$daveronald> do you even have a manger Plague?
[0:37:24] <derap41> That's half a triss haircut
[0:37:33] <%criticalinked> looks like whatsherface from Witcher 3
[0:37:36] <+anhero64> issa look
[0:37:47] <Tasetsu> Triss
[0:37:48] <%Triblade1992> @criticalinked Trish Merigold/
[0:37:54] <+corrosivePaladin> ive only ever used tatoos to make scars
[0:37:56] <Coystick> Make her a juggelo
[0:37:57] <derap41> Blind eye is hot
[0:37:57] <EuropanLamprey> Make her a Geisha!
[0:37:59] <%JailShmixRemix> Can you have multiple scars? @PlagueOfGripes
[0:38:02] <GMKGoat> Can you give her freckles
[0:38:06] <TardigradeRex> Her eye was scratched out by a housecat from the look of it.
[0:38:08] <%criticalinked> @Triblade1992 yeah that's the one
[0:38:20] <EuropanLamprey> Crocodile Scar
[0:38:35] <derap41> Berserk
[0:38:43] <derap41> Guts all guts
[0:38:45] <smile64> i kind of like that too, no idea what about it appeals to me
[0:38:48] <spitfire___> medieval mascara yes
[0:38:48] <+EpicBigchill> ICP face mask?
[0:38:51] <yodajr99> give her a dirt face
[0:38:56] <+Vestillion> Ooh, blackface
[0:38:57] <FirmarTheTrilby> It's Dark Souls all over again, Berserk references everywhere.
[0:38:59] <Partrap> id like it if you could make your character blind, but if you did, you load in and its just a black screen, the game and sounds are still running, but you just get to look at a black screen
[0:39:00] <Coystick> Tattoo tiara looks cool
[0:39:18] <derap41> Just do blackface
[0:39:20] <Commissar_Cornflakes> The 'commando' one
[0:39:25] <ConfusedCultist> Surprisingly tasteful Character creator
[0:39:26] <korperalkavage> That one looks rad
[0:39:32] <TheWallowingWeeb> "Removing the blacks is nice" - Eli
[0:39:34] <$daveronald> give her three tear drops under the eye
[0:39:39] <+fingalights> That's how they change hair color,
[0:39:41] <+fingalights> lighing
[0:39:46] <zmuno> @daveronald ahahah
[0:39:51] <yodajr99> neet
[0:40:02] <+Vestillion> Amusement, Plague
[0:40:03] <TardigradeRex> Twitchchat brings out the best in us..
[0:40:03] <GMKGoat> Damn. Calling Nic out like that
[0:40:04] <spitfire___> stoopid is funy
[0:40:07] <Puhff> Cuz it funny
[0:40:08] <CyberDingus> Give her some nice lips buddy
[0:40:08] <derap41> Cause the stupid option is easiest
[0:40:18] <yodajr99> cause we're stupid
[0:40:18] <FirmarTheTrilby> Cuz ppl are stoopid.
[0:40:22] <%Triblade1992> Because you get funny shit like ZeroLenny and his Dark Souls Experience runs Plague\
[0:40:24] <korperalkavage> Because people are seals that clap their hands and go "ARF ARF"
[0:40:25] <+Bearzone> memes an shitposts lol
[0:40:33] <derap41> With those white iris
[0:40:34] <andularios> Can you put freckles on her?
[0:40:35] <%Triblade1992> Gamer hat
[0:40:36] <Commissar_Cornflakes> Man fall down go boom is one of the oldest forms of humor in human history.
[0:40:38] <%JailShmixRemix> When people can't be associated with their comments they tend to get stupid
[0:40:40] <Exadata_> give her neon hair hur hur hur 👏 👏
[0:40:41] <%criticalinked> people have bad taste. I'm just glad you give a shit about your character's face.
[0:40:43] <andularios> She would look very nice
[0:40:43] <Commissar_Cornflakes> 'Man look stupid' is right next door to that.
[0:40:44] <Daba_mk2> Easy humor
[0:40:44] <MESeele> no freckles!?
[0:40:47] <Coystick> Because Sonic is to be mocked
[0:40:50] <ConfusedCultist> That's the internet for you
[0:40:54] <korperalkavage> The stupid big eyes, I remember that, and its always with the bird character
[0:40:58] <mizamar> gamers rise up
[0:41:03] <+fingalights> Sanuc
[0:41:05] <dadeaner> doesnt help when theres like 9 options
[0:41:05] <+Vestillion> I find this elitist diatribe alarming
[0:41:06] <andularios> Freckles is the way
[0:41:09] <derap41> Ganguro?
[0:41:14] <+Vestillion> as though stupid funny things are wrong
[0:41:17] <Partrap> theres literally entire youtube series about making stupid characters in every game possible, because people will watch stupid things, they dont want the stupid things themselves, but they want to watch them
[0:41:20] <Coystick> Holy shit make a gyaru
[0:41:22] <TheWe4pon> hey @PlagueOfGripes were you making starsiege references during your doom stream?
[0:41:29] <%Triblade1992> To be fair plague. You can get a few good stupid designs. ZeroLenny's design from the Dark Souls Experience is a good example of good dumb character creation
[0:41:45] <derap41> You're really into ginger/redhead aren't you
[0:41:54] <Peculiar_Pangolin> Skin type option might have freckles
[0:41:55] <Commissar_Cornflakes> Yeah honestly I'd go with nothing.
[0:41:59] <Daksaysso> simple makeup looks the best IMO
[0:42:01] <yodajr99> I used to have freckles
[0:42:03] <spitfire___> clean is best
[0:42:07] <derap41> No freckles are weird
[0:42:22] <EuropanLamprey> Make her Crocodile!
[0:42:23] <yodajr99> freckles are cute
[0:42:25] <andularios> The whole white powder face might me for a future french wig dlc? So you can pretend be royalty?
[0:42:27] <jeroendegarn> i always feel that those people are to insecure to take tbemselves seriously and choose to hide behind humor as to not have to honestly express themselves, like the you play a girl so you must be gay people
[0:42:33] <andularios> might be*
[0:42:40] <Coystick> Maybe try raven hair?
[0:42:49] <derap41> Lucky man
[0:42:51] <+Sturk> bitterShook
[0:42:54] <Daba_mk2> lol
[0:42:54] <@Nightbot> Plague is a youtube animator and also streams at https://picarto.tv/Plague . Also: t-shirts! http://goo.gl/lze8QO
[0:42:55] <spitfire___> so no abs slider ? bad game
[0:43:03] <trianglehat> pretty neat
[0:43:04] <MonstarGrrrl> daddy ?
[0:43:05] <Commissar_Cornflakes> The opposite is to descend to /vg/ levels of neurotic obsession with the appearance of your 'waifu' only for the internet to mock the character you spent 20 hours on.
[0:43:07] <%Triblade1992> oh no
[0:43:07] <EuropanLamprey> Your father's a Troll
[0:43:07] <yodajr99> @sturk yo

[0:43:11] <Coystick> Thank you fro-father
[0:43:13] <Partrap> bald your dad

[0:43:21] <sSamurai9> Thicc
[0:43:23] <Peculiar_Pangolin> You get to see the child version of your character too and it's horrifying
[0:43:25] <TardigradeRex> Max out the height, went for the extreme there, did ya? ;)
[0:43:27] <+fingalights> Choose your Family
[0:43:27] <korperalkavage> Plague's father is Krillin
[0:43:59] <yodajr99> that father is scary
[0:44:14] <derap41> Rich upper middle class
[0:44:17] <Commissar_Cornflakes> Baron's retainers.
[0:44:21] <%JailShmixRemix> THE HELMET IS BIGGER THAN HIS FACE
[0:44:24] <Tasetsu> What’s your tragic fantasy backstory?
[0:44:25] <+DukeMoose> AWWW sick
[0:44:26] <%JailShmixRemix> It covers his face
[0:44:31] <+DukeMoose> PARENTS
[0:44:42] <andularios> Father will impale the enemies and drank all your liqor
[0:44:44] <Commissar_Cornflakes> Wouldn't you be nervous if that was your husband?
[0:44:46] <yodajr99> pole arms are great
[0:44:47] <FirmarTheTrilby> That father belongs on a sex offender registry.
[0:44:51] <derap41> She looks worried
[0:44:51] <+DukeMoose> your dad slays poon
[0:44:54] <Coystick> He looks like nightmare Will Farrell
[0:45:01] <spitfire___> he looks weird but kind
[0:45:01] <derap41> Think he might have a knife at her back
[0:45:02] <Exadata_> he looks like a florida man
[0:45:03] <+Lightburst> So your dad is you?
[0:45:04] <andularios> Oh no, now he scams people wile drinking fine wine
[0:45:09] <Fredcome2bed> oh i notice iy Kappa
[0:45:09] <TardigradeRex> Your father looks like the madman that lives in the wood and throws acorns at trees.
[0:45:12] <codycurry52> Hey Plague, are all the TNG let's watches archived on Picarto? If not is there a way to get find the older ones?
[0:45:13] <yodajr99> dad looks like he's crushing
[0:45:15] <approachingdeath> The mother is scared of the father
[0:45:19] <yodajr99> on cocaine
[0:45:22] <spitfire___> yo cheese manufacturing is cool
[0:45:24] <+Lightburst> @PlagueOfGripes Your dad is you
[0:45:25] <Partrap> i feel like most people would notice that dude was crazy from 20 meters away on the street
[0:45:28] <+fingalights> He is a conspiracy Theorist
[0:45:31] <korperalkavage> He looks the overly quiet type
[0:45:36] <derap41> His Maggot cheese that never really took off
[0:45:40] <Coystick> "WIFE DID YOU SAY CHEESE?"
[0:45:41] <+neutralraff> He has a secret diary of redirect you know the one.
[0:45:41] <MrHappyFunshine> That sounds and looks like my dad
[0:45:48] <spitfire___> we still don't know for sure how caseins even work
[0:45:55] <derap41> He would have been rich if people just gave it a chance
[0:46:04] <TardigradeRex> Moms got HIPS tho!
[0:46:06] <TheWallowingWeeb> The more green bars, the faster you develope the skill
[0:46:17] <Daksaysso> the levle of something alows it to be trained faster, and with a higher cap @PlagueOfGripes

[0:46:48] <derap41> You dad looks like the smithing type
[0:46:50] <spitfire___> no will for smith ?
[0:47:22] <%Triblade1992> are we talking about Dark Souls smithing with Andre or are we talking about Dragon Quest 11 smithing?
[0:47:23] <Coystick> It's a magical shawl shaddup
[0:47:27] <Partrap> hunters mom is wearing the picolo cape

[0:47:52] <andularios> A leather vest?
[0:47:52] <+YersinioPestis> gambeson
[0:47:58] <Daksaysso> it requires both resources and the skill itself
[0:48:00] <approachingdeath> Gambeson
[0:48:03] <+Skwizgarr> Gambeson
[0:48:11] <%criticalinked> your mother gave you a blood bath is my takeaway from this
[0:48:13] <derap41> Like real talk you mom fucked the entire army
[0:48:13] <+fingalights> Gut's Mom
[0:48:14] <TardigradeRex> Basically a Groupie.

[0:48:23] <%JailShmixRemix> Gambesons always looked uncomfortable

[0:49:51] <derap41> low draw strength bow though
[0:49:56] <yodajr99> I've shot bows I hate them
[0:49:57] <EuropanLamprey> What? Fantasy makes weapons look cooler than they actually were? Say it ain't so!
[0:50:08] <Fredcome2bed> if you have not done it before maybe. but i think you can shoot pretty fast. actually
[0:50:19] <DehiDehi> if we lucky we may even get to see gameplay this evening PogChamp
[0:50:22] <Commissar_Cornflakes> I did a Nord campaign where I had a horse but only because I was a general.
[0:50:30] <Commissar_Cornflakes> When I fought it was on foot.
[0:50:44] <spitfire___> just shoot more than one arrow at a time to go faster :^)
[0:51:04] <cap_bon> Is horse archery a thing can we be steppe nomads?
[0:51:06] <%JailShmixRemix> Why does his helmet cover his eyes
[0:51:09] <TardigradeRex> 1 point to social, well that's a throwaway stat in 2020
[0:51:11] <zmuno> @spitfire___ have you see bahubali?

[0:51:25] <7th_JusticeFlame> So is this a sim type game?

[0:54:48] <Peculiar_Pangolin> The souless eyes
[0:54:48] <Coystick> Children are terrible ugly creatures

[0:57:26] <derap41> Giant Horse Girl
[0:57:42] <$doomp12> she looks like the inbred abomination of a man and a orangutan, but she was too big to go out the normal way, so she ripped her way out of her mother via her butt
[0:57:54] <+fingalights> It's the same, just stretched
[0:57:58] <yodajr99> teen creature
[0:57:59] <CyberDingus> wait wait, did someone said 'horses' and 'a girl' in the same sentence?!
[0:58:01] <+corrosivePaladin> that tiny head taterLUL

[0:58:17] <MESeele> betelguise
[0:58:19] <spitfire___> She crushes boys on the playground
[0:58:23] <asurite_warrior> It's all the coat. The coat was made for a grown man body type
[0:58:26] <subnet255> THIS ISENT EVEN MY FINAL FORM
[0:58:30] <vezear> she can use tools
[0:58:38] <%JailShmixRemix> It's definitely the head
[0:58:39] <%Triblade1992> Ung bunga
[0:58:40] <+fingalights> @derap41 to be fair, I've noticed I use my left side more than my right
[0:58:41] <GMKGoat> big and strong

[1:00:41] <weatherreport240> Just got here, what are your thoughts so far? @plagueofgripes
[1:00:44] <derap41> It was a pretty good system
[1:00:55] <%JailShmixRemix> If it ain't broke
[1:00:57] <+fingalights> This kinda pre game setup always gives me Anxiety.
[1:00:58] <+DukeMoose> i like the child-waitno
[1:01:12] <Solokaldaka> woopsHey chat
[1:01:19] <+HajimenoStream> The Child is very moosey

[1:01:38] <+HajimenoStream> THAT POSE
[1:01:53] <Skrakar> Devolve into horseback archery from the start.
[1:01:54] <Coystick> By "Hunted small game" they mean other children. Weaker children.
[1:02:00] <derap41> Do you minmax or roleplay sandboxes ?
[1:02:08] <Daksaysso> small game!
[1:02:19] <subnet255> yup
[1:02:20] <Squeak136> You can always just hire a smith down the line
[1:02:29] <yodajr99> this is the game
[1:02:32] <+fingalights> SO cool
[1:02:34] <derap41> Its the least worst one
[1:02:39] <%laserbeaming> Let's dance the Character Creation Waltz
[1:02:49] <+fingalights> She looks human now
[1:02:50] <derap41> Looks gronky

[1:03:30] <weatherreport240> it's scythian time lads
[1:03:58] <+jacewolf_is_the_best> she gettin big. i like
[1:04:05] <subnet255> so would you start the game married?
[1:04:12] <%laserbeaming> I have no idea about Mount & Blade, is the setting fantasy, historical or fake historical?
[1:04:17] <manwithaxe> from what I've seen crosbows are crazy in this one
[1:04:33] <+fingalights> Fake Historical i think
[1:04:47] <+Engwithan_Elder_God> awwwww
[1:04:50] <derap41> Small Pony
[1:04:53] <CyberDingus> cute!
[1:04:54] <ahaegotrigger> what a bunch of sweethearts
[1:05:11] <Skrakar> Mongolian horses were actually tiny.
[1:05:21] <CyberDingus> just like Mongolians
[1:05:22] <+fingalights> Bowrse Girl
[1:05:27] <yodajr99> my Mongolian small horse
[1:05:38] <derap41> Leaving the Gym like
[1:05:48] <Tasetsu> Most horses were until the past couple hundred years
[1:05:51] <+Mashuukitty> yee
[1:05:54] <derap41> Wrestle heavy armor alway
[1:05:57] <manwithaxe> Morningstar was great in 1
[1:06:06] <+Mashuukitty> Hammer and maces were major armor-to-armor weapons
[1:06:14] <+Mashuukitty> Then of course the poleaxe.
[1:06:15] <+fingalights> The Katana can cut through steel
[1:06:18] <asurite_warrior> Spear what the big killer
[1:06:24] <ItsJustShawn> moms clothing technique
[1:06:24] <asurite_warrior> was
[1:06:28] <Commissar_Cornflakes> The main use of blunt weapons in Bannerlord was nonlethal takedowns so you could sell people into slavery and ransom nobles.
[1:06:42] <Commissar_Cornflakes> IMO go with infantry.
[1:06:48] <yodajr99> joined the band of the hawk
[1:06:49] <%laserbeaming> I do like Javelins
[1:06:50] <derap41> So you're short now
[1:06:55] <Commissar_Cornflakes> Gets you more polearm and supplementary melee and improves your melee ability.
[1:06:58] <SinnerBeta> I liked hammers in M&B warband since they knocked out people rather than kill them, and you could then take them as prisoners for ransom
[1:06:58] <Daksaysso> Scouts!
[1:06:59] <+Engwithan_Elder_God> cav
[1:07:01] <mizamar> cavlary
[1:07:03] <derap41> Better hore with calvary
[1:07:03] <MrHappyFunshine> Cavalry to get more buffs
[1:07:03] <Squeak136> Cav
[1:07:04] <DVMtwitch> cav
[1:07:04] <%laserbeaming> Scout

[1:07:10] <guyman125> polearms all the way
[1:07:10] <+Mashuukitty> What faction are you going to join?
[1:07:12] <Skrakar> Devolve into horse archery.
[1:07:14] <Daba_mk2> ride the pony

[1:07:16] <CyberDingus> WAR PONY

[1:07:21] <weatherreport240> SCYTHIAN PONY PRINCESS

[1:07:32] <+Mashuukitty> Cavalry time
[1:07:50] <+Mashuukitty> I dont know the names of the factrions...just kinda what they are based off of
[1:07:53] <Daksaysso> that's backgroun, not who you start with @PlagueOfGripes
[1:07:54] <%laserbeaming> I like dirty
[1:07:55] <ahaegotrigger> I like Dirty girls
[1:07:58] <SinnerBeta> dirty peasant
[1:07:59] <yodajr99> dirt pony
[1:08:01] <manwithaxe> couching lances is a little less OP in this game, since its easier for infantry to launch a counter strike
[1:08:03] <Coystick> Oh no you made a horse girl
[1:08:09] <+jacewolf_is_the_best> get them flanks
[1:08:19] <CyberDingus> "horse'' and ''girl'' does not mix well.
[1:08:37] <+fingalights> @CyberDingus google results would agree
[1:08:45] <CyberDingus> aka6 would Especially agree.
[1:08:46] <%laserbeaming> I trust the wisdom of someone called CyberDingus
[1:08:46] <Commissar_Cornflakes> Valor is probably reputation-related
[1:08:47] <yodajr99> horse girls are fine
[1:08:49] <+jacewolf_is_the_best> mmmm dirty
[1:08:49] <derap41> Valor is post combat stat thingy
[1:08:57] <ahaegotrigger> are you saying I shouldnt google Horse Girl @CyberDingus
[1:08:59] <Commissar_Cornflakes> renown is just how well-known you are
[1:09:00] <MrHappyFunshine> Valor is your reputation for honour and stuff
[1:09:00] <derap41> You can be unfamous too I think
[1:09:01] <+EternalFire9> Maybe it's like honor in the first game?
[1:09:04] <Daksaysso> Valor, honor, mercy and others are in the game
[1:09:10] <Commissar_Cornflakes> Valour is probably honor
[1:09:11] <CyberDingus> Horse-girls are fine. A horse and A girl, however...
[1:09:17] <Commissar_Cornflakes> oh, apparently not lel
[1:09:18] <+EternalFire9> ah nevermind
[1:09:21] <yodajr99> who needs honor
[1:09:22] <%laserbeaming> Ask Catherine the Great about horses (I know it's a myth, but I like that myth)
[1:09:22] <%JailShmixRemix> Who the fuck has HONOR anymore
[1:09:28] <SuperVaderMan> what's the difference between valor and honor LUL
[1:09:41] <%JailShmixRemix> That myth is the reason I passed my test on Russia
[1:09:44] <derap41> This is boring one you started a farm
[1:09:58] <MrHappyFunshine> With a small loan of 1 million Denars
[1:10:04] <derap41> Especially in these days
[1:10:04] <+fingalights> Interest rates are low right now
[1:10:12] <yodajr99> owning land is impossible these days

[1:25:23] <+fingalights> The jank will take you
[1:25:29] <SuperVaderMan> og m&b sucks when you take as much damage as the mooks
[1:25:33] <CyberDingus> ''death gun'' is extremely 90s
[1:25:35] <Coystick> [sweats in Ultra Violence]
[1:25:37] <%Engwithan_Elder_God> Spend the entire game a slave/captive.
[1:25:40] <+YersinioPestis> These games will kill you fast regardless unless you get lucky
[1:25:47] <%SilverRoddo> Can’t wait til Thanosgun courts her.
[1:25:54] <derap41> Full damage
[1:26:09] <+fingalights> Yeah, the real world is pretty hard
[1:26:26] <yodajr99> real world is very hard
[1:26:43] <weatherreport240> Full damage on everything coward
[1:26:47] <Fredcome2bed> hit by a rock in the head and die Realistic
[1:26:47] <derap41> Realistic means instant death
[1:26:54] <weatherreport240> have a not fun time
[1:26:54] <Artista_AF> so dcrease everything to lowest then?
[1:27:04] <derap41> If you don't have armor you will fucking die
[1:27:07] <subnet255> just wear a helmet lol
[1:27:09] <Excelumin> the game can really Sir Daniel Fortesque you
[1:27:28] <cap_bon> As it turns out realism isnt very fun
[1:27:36] <derap41> Cause gamer culute
[1:27:40] <+corrosivePaladin> because thats how difficulty works
[1:27:41] <BaslerJones> @PlagueOfGripes because this game sucks
[1:27:45] <crusader_heide> Nightmare Beta!
[1:27:46] <+corrosivePaladin> theres no normal its only baby or suffer
[1:28:00] <Excelumin> realism is suffering
[1:28:01] <derap41> That one doesn't really affect things
[1:28:03] <+fingalights> Hell on Earth difficulty
[1:28:18] <BaslerJones> I followed this game's development very close mate
[1:28:26] <crusader_heide> Ugly charm
[1:28:27] <+fingalights> As is the Euro Jank
[1:28:28] <brainlessn00b> ???
[1:28:37] <derap41> Square tits
[1:28:37] <BaslerJones> yeah warband is good because its fluid and fun
[1:28:42] <Excelumin> isn't that Kenshi's appeal too?
[1:28:47] <kingra> Baby, Toddler DEATH GAUNTLET
[1:28:54] <+fingalights> Yes! Kenshi is much the same
[1:28:56] <Shardelre> oh god that loading horse
[1:29:02] <+EpicBigchill> Hey guy
[1:29:03] <CyberDingus> @Excelumin It is
[1:29:03] <TomFrank> good ol archi
[1:29:04] <GMKGoat> Archibald's head is weirdly shaped
[1:29:08] <+fingalights> But I can deal with Kenshi's jank better than M&B
[1:29:09] <subnet255> SMOrc
[1:29:15] <crusader_heide> influence?
[1:29:20] <crusader_heide> indifferent bro
[1:29:22] <Fenlig> Kill him to show dominants!!
[1:29:23] <derap41> Nogand
[1:29:29] <ItsJustShawn> Brother Neutral
[1:29:30] <+Oprender> Just because he calls you sister doesnt mean its blood related
[1:29:32] <derap41> Free chainmail
[1:29:33] <gojira__> romance brother
[1:29:50] <crusader_heide> glue them to your shield
[1:29:50] <GMKGoat> Your brother's influence should be tanked if you pick the run away background
[1:29:59] <+fingalights> Keep the blood line pure
[1:30:03] <CyberDingus> RIP AND TEAR she says. In a cute voice.
[1:30:10] <yodajr99> don't worry they will be
[1:30:11] <Commissar_Cornflakes> Brother looks like he rips people in half for a living.
[1:30:15] <BaslerJones> @PlagueOfGripes There are two units that are extremly broken in this game, Battanian Hero and cavalry, I am not kidding when I say that a 100 battanian heroes can destroy a 500 man army
[1:30:39] <BaslerJones> cavalry on this is like trucks its funny
[1:30:55] <jsikandere> hows it look
[1:30:56] <BaslerJones> also sorry for the negativity on the game, I am salty today with it
[1:30:56] <KakePews> ermegerd tower shield :f
[1:31:00] <CyberDingus> the adventure of DEATHGUN begins
[1:31:06] <crusader_heide> I missed it, can you save character created preset?
[1:31:18] <TomFrank> well with a name like deathgun
[1:31:20] <+fingalights> She looked pure Methed out before
[1:31:21] <derap41> That's pretty normal for these rough times
[1:31:22] <CyberDingus> DEATHGUN shows no mercy neither to enemies nor to lovers
[1:31:39] <Fenlig> Reminds me of Mordhau
[1:31:49] <BaslerJones> Kingdom Come had something similar
[1:31:51] <Excelumin> she kinda reminds me of Kassandra from ass creed odyssey
[1:31:56] <crusader_heide> reminds me of Arma 2 training
[1:31:57] <+fingalights> This looks like Chivalry tutorial
[1:32:18] <derap41> @fingalights That's probably the one
[1:32:22] <crusader_heide> more right
[1:32:27] <+EpicBigchill> right click and move mouse right?
[1:32:27] <SnackinOnChimps> The one that was exactly like this was that Medieval online fighting game. Chivalry?
[1:32:30] <%JailShmixRemix> righter right plague
[1:32:36] <weatherreport240> I think you still can
[1:32:43] <Fredcome2bed> without shield maybe
[1:32:45] <weatherreport240> you could in the demo anyway
[1:32:47] <AnacondaVirtue> @PlagueOfGripes You can still do that. Head to the menu
[1:32:50] <BaslerJones> yeah this game has no automatic block
[1:32:51] <+YelloGek> Is it click-right and drag, or turn then right click?
[1:32:52] <muzzyru> release shield and then right block
[1:32:54] <brutalgenie> lol trainer gave up
[1:32:59] <+EpicBigchill> move the mouse right
[1:33:05] <JollyGdFellow> move mouse then right click
[1:33:05] <BaslerJones> its mouse only now
[1:33:07] <+Punishedkaiger> I think it means your mouse plague
[1:33:07] <Daksaysso> this is big brain time
[1:33:09] <asurite_warrior> put down shield
[1:33:09] <digitaljeff> let go of block and swipe and block
[1:33:11] <+badbloodbear> flick right then block
[1:33:14] <+EpicBigchill> what the thing showed
[1:33:23] <asurite_warrior> it's wants you to just use sword
[1:33:23] <+badbloodbear> flick right then press block
[1:33:24] <+fingalights> Click while flick?
[1:33:25] <%Rezca> let go
[1:33:27] <+Punishedkaiger> Wait, IS it broken?
[1:33:28] <gojira__> release click, move mouse right, then right click
[1:33:29] <%JailShmixRemix> @PlagueOfGripes The arrow has to be point from the right
[1:33:37] <manwithaxe> try arrow on the right before raising shield
[1:33:38] <+YelloGek> Trainer will stare until the pupil understands- BUT NO WORDS!
[1:33:43] <+EpicBigchill> there we go
[1:33:52] <%Rezca> LET GO
[1:33:53] <Commissar_Cornflakes> Just turn on auto-block.
[1:33:56] <+EpicBigchill> he loves it
[1:33:58] <TomFrank> BEAT HIS ASS
[1:34:01] <vaudrain> Drop shield, start moving, then block
[1:34:01] <%JailShmixRemix> Thats his kink
[1:34:02] <Commissar_Cornflakes> The directional block in Warband was annoying, too.
[1:34:05] <kulmoth> d and then block
[1:34:06] <+badbloodbear> it works trust me alreaady done it before
[1:34:06] <asurite_warrior> shield is universal. It wants you to use the sword
[1:34:07] <kulmoth> i guess
[1:34:10] <%Rezca> move then block
[1:34:15] <BaslerJones> there is a block-delay, you have to release the block and then block again
[1:34:18] <Futurecity10> Lower shield then move
[1:34:22] <BaslerJones> there is no auto block they removed it
[1:34:31] <%badbloodbear> badbloodbear subscribed with Twitch Prime. 
[1:34:45] <brutalgenie> real men use halberds
[1:35:05] <%Rezca> Let go of block
[1:35:07] <asurite_warrior> put your shield away and use just the sword
[1:35:07] <BaslerJones> omegabrain time
[1:35:07] <JollyGdFellow> let go first
[1:35:08] <%Rezca> then move and block
[1:35:14] <Daksaysso> oh my god this is torture lol
[1:35:18] <%JailShmixRemix> @PlagueOfGripes You need to let go of block and defend with the arrow pointing up
[1:35:21] <kulmoth> plague is such a boomer
[1:35:24] <+EpicBigchill> @PlagueOfGripes do you have to do the inputs at the same time?
[1:35:32] <%Rezca> Move then block
[1:35:33] <Fredcome2bed> put shield on back and use sword to block i think
[1:35:42] <Futurecity10> @plagueofgripes lower your shield
[1:35:45] <%Rezca> to shift your block
[1:36:01] <+TheStarvingGood> I think this they are trying to teach you to block with your weapon
[1:36:02] <Desertfishing> the arrow is the direction your blocking/attacking
[1:36:03] <manwithaxe> transparent arrow is at the top now
[1:36:07] <digitaljeff> LET GO OF BLOCK SWIPE DOWN AND BLOCK AT THE SAME TIME
[1:36:14] <%JailShmixRemix> @PlagueOfGripes The arrow on screen shows which way your blocking
[1:36:15] <+corrosivePaladin> tutorial seems like its being dumb and wants actions done in a specific order rather then just doing whats needed
[1:36:21] <jsikandere> alas he is not footman material
[1:36:21] <chroma3> its quite simple actually
[1:36:28] <Daksaysso> that arrow on you screen is the direction arrow, it shows where you'll block or attack @plau
[1:36:35] <Daksaysso> @PlagueOfGripes
[1:36:36] <gojira__> @PlagueOfGripes you can't change block directions while holding block, you have to stop & start again in a different direction
[1:36:36] <+corrosivePaladin> pogonaPasta
[1:36:42] <%JailShmixRemix> Attack
[1:36:42] <asurite_warrior> attack
[1:36:46] <digitaljeff> SWIPE AND CLICK
[1:36:47] <%Rezca> attack time
[1:36:51] <%JailShmixRemix> smack the cuck
[1:36:53] <digitaljeff> PLAGUE PLS
[1:36:53] <jsikandere> wait did you play warband, Plague?
[1:36:55] <Squeak136> The white arrows tell you what direction the action you're taking will be in
[1:37:04] <+fingalights> To be fair, I hate this combat .
[1:37:06] <crusader_heide> we did it
[1:37:09] <digitaljeff> Plague never played Warband
[1:37:12] <%Rezca> This is It
[1:37:14] <%JailShmixRemix> He did
[1:37:17] <Shardelre> That tune is the same as warband's, but remastered i guess ?
[1:37:30] <%JailShmixRemix> Warband has autoblock which is a must
[1:37:30] <Daksaysso> oh goody it's over lol
[1:37:53] <digitaljeff> This is gonna be bad
[1:37:55] <CaptHat211> Do they plan on adding "fun"?
[1:37:56] <brutalgenie> plague is destined for 2 handers
[1:38:27] <crusader_heide> "Stop trying to hit me and hit me!"
[1:38:38] <Commissar_Cornflakes> Did they actually remove the auto-block?
[1:38:43] <%JailShmixRemix> PogChamp this is the mount and blade experience I wanted
[1:38:43] <CaptHat211> More like "Mountain Bland"
[1:38:50] <$daveronald> so are you happy?
[1:38:51] <Daksaysso> why does everyone play this in third person?
[1:38:56] <deathkid300> is tve game good ?
[1:39:03] <Coystick> Beat him
[1:39:05] <%JailShmixRemix> Polearms still suck too PogChamp
[1:39:06] <crusader_heide> @CaptHat211 ay ohhh
[1:39:21] <Daba_mk2> lol
[1:39:42] <Coystick> Being a "Rookie Trainer" is kind of an oxymoron isn't it?
[1:39:44] <CaptHat211> @crusader_heide Now play me off, Paul!
[1:39:47] <tdude0175> This Looks alot better than warband.
[1:39:51] <Daba_mk2> this combat system is rough
[1:39:54] <Excelumin> holy shit the AI is just relentless
[1:39:58] <jsikandere> yeees the shrieks of pain amuuuse me
[1:40:01] <%JailShmixRemix> Kick his ass LUL
[1:40:03] <crusader_heide> Shield kick?
[1:40:11] <+SarcFa> spears have always sucked in mount and blade melee
[1:40:14] <CaptHat211> Woah that last one was great
[1:40:21] <Squeak136> The combat system works fine, you just need to learn how to use it
[1:40:27] <KosOrSomeSayKosm_> boy that combat sure is...uh...
[1:40:31] <+fingalights> It's meant for Chaos
[1:40:42] <Daksaysso> get on a hose for polearms
[1:40:45] <Coystick> Just equip chaos twohander???
[1:40:52] <Daksaysso> otherwise they suck
[1:41:06] <crusader_heide> blocking way harder with no shield
[1:41:16] <Coystick> Early access AI
[1:41:16] <aeravon> this feels like a medieval version of the jedi knight/jedi academy fighting system
[1:41:33] <TheWallowingWeeb> You look twice his size
[1:41:41] <Coystick> This looks like eurojank For Honor
[1:41:49] <+fingalights> Just noticed how big she looks, It's great
[1:41:52] <Fenlig> Are you a giant woman?
[1:42:01] <%JailShmixRemix> This massive woman beating the shit out of manlets
[1:42:11] <+YelloGek> Surely, the best PvP can be attained when everyone's puppeting potato dolls.
[1:42:18] <Coystick> When. Will. They. Learn?
[1:42:23] <crusader_heide> i think so
[1:42:26] <tdude0175> Reminds me of the good old days of running into the armies in full plate swinging a two handed great sword and killing like 3 guys in one swing.
[1:42:26] <TheWallowingWeeb> You're getting bigger with every manlet destroyed
[1:42:34] <Squeak136> Chamber their attacks
[1:42:38] <jsikandere> ah yess this is bringing back nightmares of tourneys
[1:42:49] <Squeak136> Swing in the same direction as them and you can counter their spam
[1:42:53] <@Nightbot> Plague is a youtube animator and also streams at https://picarto.tv/Plague . Also: t-shirts! http://goo.gl/lze8QO
[1:42:53] <%JailShmixRemix> Guarding isn't worth it if you have max attack speed LUL
[1:42:58] <Coystick> Crush the manlets, take their unsprouted seed, and grow ever larger
[1:43:15] <crusader_heide> i dont think kick does damage at all
[1:43:19] <brutalgenie> beating up on all these Pats to increase height
[1:43:20] <%JailShmixRemix> It doesn't
[1:43:31] <tdude0175> The kick probably does more to someone blocking
[1:43:41] <CyberDingus> DEATHGUN THE LIVER DEVOURER!!!
[1:43:43] <+fingalights> I remember people talking up the combat so much. Then I touched it
[1:43:43] <%JailShmixRemix> The kick is only supposed to stagger
[1:43:50] <Coystick> Liver is gross
[1:43:53] <crusader_heide> fight this horse!
[1:43:56] <Daba_mk2> the sound when they it the shield is kinda goofy
[1:44:00] <derap41> Man you a lugging around like a mofo
[1:44:07] <derap41> Tiny bow
[1:44:11] <+jacewolf_is_the_best> aim for the eyes
[1:44:25] <derap41> That is a bow for babies
[1:44:31] <+YelloGek> Seems like it'll be chaotic enough to provide the illusion of a well-deserved victory.
[1:44:38] <Squeak136> I mean a lot of the complaints are genuinely from people who don't know how the combat works...
[1:45:16] <CyberDingus> I think the sound comes 0.4 seconds before video.
[1:45:19] <crusader_heide> not bad all things considered
[1:45:32] <cap_bon> It was nice of the local peasantry to set up these aiming circles
[1:46:01] <KosOrSomeSayKosm_> that text was barely readable
[1:46:20] <crusader_heide> might be more fun to archer? oroLUL
[1:46:36] <TheWallowingWeeb> Shift to zoom
[1:46:54] <+fingalights> Oh, does it operated on Morrowind rules?
[1:47:32] <CaptHat211> You know a game has gone to hell when you look at something in the game and say "this used to be fun"
[1:47:44] <Getzan> no stamina bar, yet
[1:47:45] <CyberDingus> Imagine the cost of those destroyed clay jugs
[1:47:52] <jsikandere> what the heck? since when do ranged weapons not miss 19 out of 20 shots?
[1:48:28] <ThirdPersonPhil> active reload maybe?
[1:48:31] <%theman515> maybe it's different stats for the speed of the two stages?
[1:48:35] <+fingalights> Reset animation, maybe
[1:48:36] <aeravon> first is cocking the string, secon is loading the bolt
[1:48:38] <crusader_heide> one pulls the string back, other yeah
[1:48:40] <Getzan> you are putting the string back and putting a bolt in
[1:48:40] <manwithaxe> cocking, loading the bolt looks like
[1:48:43] <Fenlig> Maybe smaller crossbows will have one bar and bigger ones will have 3
[1:48:55] <CyberDingus> Plague dont
[1:48:56] <+corrosivePaladin> who needs to read when your character cant
[1:48:56] <tdude0175> Can you try and move while they are loading?
[1:48:58] <CyberDingus> you are not ready
[1:49:01] <crusader_heide> trust worthy brother
[1:49:01] <joedanman> but horse though
[1:49:02] <Getzan> goat leg crank or a pulley crank oooof
[1:49:04] <+fingalights> LOADING
[1:49:18] <jsikandere> women only army go
[1:49:19] <Shardelre> animation-wise it looked like the first bar was cocking the crossbow and second one is bolt placement
[1:49:40] <Sokumotanaka> What is this an mmo?rpg/jrpg?
[1:49:47] <+Mashuukitty> That is a good fake Europe
[1:49:49] <Getzan> oh wow they changed the map alot
[1:50:00] <%theman515> single player rph @Sokumotanaka
[1:50:03] <%theman515> rpg*
[1:50:08] <tdude0175> They changed this a bunch
[1:50:10] <ThirdPersonPhil> ooh yeah that music
[1:50:12] <KosOrSomeSayKosm_> @Sokumotanaka I assume you're joking when saying this is a jrpg
[1:50:19] <Getzan> Thats a Desert LUL
[1:50:20] <crusader_heide> south is desert i believe
[1:50:22] <LeBlanc233> is that snow or sand?
[1:50:24] <%Engwithan_Elder_God> I think that's sand down south
[1:50:26] <Sokumotanaka> @theman515 Oh cool
[1:50:27] <+fingalights> RPG Strategy Medieval sim,
[1:51:06] <KosOrSomeSayKosm_> actually no fuck it, this IS a jrpg, plague even has the waifu
[1:51:07] <Getzan> what faction did gripe choose?
[1:51:07] <Sokumotanaka> @KosOrSomeSayKosm_ I always use rpg/jrpg it makse things easier when explaining and asking questions, you know the way you can get educated?
[1:51:18] <crusader_heide> multiplayer keeps crashing over and over
[1:51:29] <+Punishedkaiger> The multiplayer is a bad experience
[1:51:29] <Commissar_Cornflakes> hahaha
[1:51:36] <Commissar_Cornflakes> they even kept the 'quest complete' musical sting
[1:51:38] <Getzan> Oh man the Quest fanfare LUL
[1:51:44] <Commissar_Cornflakes> Changed it, but kept it
[1:51:45] <Commissar_Cornflakes> good
[1:51:53] <+Oprender> This game came out recently?
[1:51:55] <Getzan> same tune, but way more orcastral
[1:51:55] <Sokumotanaka> What is it like kingdom come?
[1:52:02] <Getzan> @Oprender this moring
[1:52:05] <Getzan> morning*
[1:52:06] <Excelumin> I love my car-horse
[1:52:15] <ThirdPersonPhil> that is not how car works tough... not even in video games
[1:52:24] <Getzan> resident evil 4 villager Kappa
[1:52:25] <Fredcome2bed> not a cia informant
[1:52:26] <Commissar_Cornflakes> This guy looks like he'd ask to see your feet before he'd help you.
[1:52:51] <+jHindsight_LIVE> is this single player? or multiplayer?
[1:52:51] <Excelumin> Pay? DansGame
[1:52:56] <Getzan> Single
[1:53:15] <+fingalights> Meant as Single, but I guess it has multiplayr
[1:53:16] <+YersinioPestis> it can be single or multi
[1:53:23] <+jHindsight_LIVE> all im seeing is single player streams, is multiplayer even out?
[1:53:25] <Getzan> Did Gripe choose Empire as his starter faction? DansGame
[1:53:31] <+HajimenoStream> eaaaaarly
[1:53:42] <BaslerJones> @jHindsight_LIVE yes but i think the servers are dead at the moment
[1:53:50] <crusader_heide> @jHindsight_LIVE yea but it keeps crashing
[1:53:54] <BaslerJones> probably preparing to the influx of people
[1:54:07] <Daba_mk2> early access DansGame
[1:54:08] <tdude0175> All mount and blade games were in early access
[1:54:19] <Fenlig> Maybe you can pay some other way ;)
[1:54:22] <%Rezca> "expensive"
[1:54:28] <jsikandere> you would have given him 900 gold irl
[1:54:30] <crusader_heide> i think your followers need to have food to eat as they travel with you
[1:54:33] <Getzan> @Fenlig cmonBruh
[1:54:40] <jsikandere> "seems expensive but okay"
[1:55:14] <Getzan> Upkeep perhapds
[1:55:21] <crusader_heide> weekly pay?
[1:55:26] <BaslerJones> it used to be a week
[1:55:26] <Getzan> last game was a weekly upkeep ingame
[1:55:37] <+LeiteroMasta> it's dayly wages pretty sure
[1:55:45] <tdude0175> Movement speed income your man power now/max now.
[1:55:54] <BaslerJones> there is a funky glitch in this game, if you have 50 soldiers against 1, they will round around this one soldier and never kill him
[1:55:58] <Getzan> they learned from the mods, of teleporting to the village elder and the Guildmaster
[1:56:02] <Getzan> Companions?
[1:56:06] <+HajimenoStream> its dark syde phil
[1:56:08] <Excelumin> he looks like he owns a shady kebab shop
[1:56:23] <crusader_heide> Taco CHest! PogChamp
[1:56:39] <+HajimenoStream> >10 years of development
[1:56:40] <derap41> Your horse eats ass
[1:56:44] <+HajimenoStream> >no npc mouth animation
[1:56:53] <%CommanderSqueaks> CommanderSqueaks subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 5 months! Yay, it's the janky game.
[1:56:55] <Sokumotanaka> As apposed to a large pug?
[1:56:56] <Getzan> Destroy them all
[1:57:24] <+fingalights> Eh, if there is no voice acting, i don't mind no mouth movement
[1:57:25] <BaslerJones> cavalry is immensively broken in this game
[1:57:36] <Getzan> its alot better than the Native M&B
[1:57:52] <derap41> Not using spear -_-
[1:58:10] <derap41> Much better
[1:58:14] <Getzan> yeah charging into a soldier = only 8 damage
[1:58:17] <Daxalog> I remember them toppeling in warband? No?
[1:58:22] <Getzan> from the previous game
[1:58:28] <Getzan> no knock over
[1:58:29] <+Taglog7> Image this is IRL
[1:58:33] <CyberDingus> Horses. On Open Space. No BOWS. Do you even Mongol, Eli?
[1:58:36] <+HajimenoStream> WE RAN THEM DOWN
[1:58:37] <+mankeyfigh> Is this PvP?
[1:58:39] <+HajimenoStream> VICTORY
[1:58:39] <%Engwithan_Elder_God> FUCK YEAH DEATH
[1:58:44] <Commissar_Cornflakes> So far this seems like Warband, but better.
[1:58:48] <crusader_heide> Meats back on the menu boys
[1:58:52] <+fingalights> LEt's all make out!! No girls
[1:58:53] <Lelfro> Who's gonna jerk me on?
[1:58:54] <Getzan> Now you can knock them over in this game, its great fun
[1:59:01] <Excelumin> what, do you not bond with your comrades after murdering bandits?
[1:59:02] <subnet255> SMOrc
[1:59:04] <Coystick> They're so happy!!
[1:59:07] <restingbones> That adrenaline is PUMPIN
[1:59:09] <crusader_heide> bloody horse face
[1:59:12] <BaslerJones> the problem is, if you have an army of cavalry against an army of infantry, the cavalry will always win because the inf AI doesn't know how to stop horses
[1:59:17] <Coystick> "mmMMMMMMMEE"
[1:59:17] <tdude0175> In warband it was glitchy enough to you could make a wall of unmounted horses and they wouldn't take damage or at least alot and then you could slow down calvary and then swarm them
[1:59:19] <BaslerJones> and the horses knock them out
[1:59:20] <derap41> These are some happy boys
[1:59:22] <heartlesshealer> oh man, they brought back the jank for the second game's battles?
[1:59:25] <heartlesshealer> nice
[1:59:25] <Getzan> Heaven be Praised?
[1:59:28] <BaslerJones> so it breaks their formation and then they all die in the second charge
[1:59:31] <GMKGoat> 3 hours later
[1:59:31] <%JailShmixRemix> look at how bloody that horse is
[1:59:34] <nepwar> strive to be as happy as barbarians who have just finished a bloodbath
[1:59:39] <derap41> Looks good
[1:59:56] <jsikandere> knock him off that fine steed
[1:59:56] <restingbones> They love it
[1:59:57] <%theman515> Can't stop won't stop baby
[1:59:58] <+Mashuukitty> They have mules. You should get a mule
[1:59:59] <%Engwithan_Elder_God> They're really happy
[2:00:02] <%SilverRoddo> Edgehorse
[2:00:05] <+fingalights> No stop Murder Boners
[2:00:09] <BaslerJones> lmao
[2:00:12] <$sleepy_coffee> sleepy_coffee subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 6 months! With the man eating horses and the dumb men who ride them, it is good to be back.
[2:00:13] <Fenlig> Well how long do you calm down after murder? Anyone know?
[2:00:15] <CaptHat211> They haven't had a W in a long time
[2:00:16] <Cyral_Drive> SwiftRage YEAAAAAAA
[2:00:16] <nepwar> man i can't wait to see a 100 man hype squad
[2:00:20] <Getzan> WAAAAAGH
[2:00:22] <Commissar_Cornflakes> Oh hey, Plague is a Baratheon
[2:00:30] <crusader_heide> i wish the horses would ly down and they fall off cheering
[2:00:36] <Getzan> Lady Baratheon Kappa
[2:00:37] <jsikandere> heaven be praised? whoah there buddy dont push yer beliefs on the rest of us
[2:00:39] <derap41> No quarter means no mercy
[2:00:42] <Commissar_Cornflakes> I mean to be fair these guys are murderous bandits
[2:00:42] <+Estuko> @Fenlig doctors say the erection may last for up to 5 hours.
[2:00:50] <Getzan> no Quarter means no Prisoners
[2:00:51] <%Engwithan_Elder_God> Nogand, fucking anchor of the team.
[2:00:55] <$sleepy_coffee> Some stories tell that the men still scream on the horses to this day
[2:00:56] <BlueLunecy> To be a medieval peasant high on the feeling of cheating death
[2:01:04] <%SilverRoddo> They relish the moment. For sure.
[2:01:05] <Livelinne> Hi Plague
[2:01:06] <Commissar_Cornflakes> In the equivalent period in Europe they could expect punishments like being broken on a wheel
[2:01:07] <jorniev> OH PLAGUE ISEE YOU ARE PLAYING BOYARLORD 2
[2:01:15] <heartlesshealer> Yeah, it's almost worse than slashing
[2:01:15] <Commissar_Cornflakes> Or being impaled.
[2:01:22] <derap41> Broken bones and brained
[2:01:22] <jorniev> creat swords are fun
[2:01:24] <heartlesshealer> F for bones
[2:01:24] <+fingalights> Internal damage is bad
[2:01:36] <%JailShmixRemix> Internal bleeding YAAAAAA!!
[2:01:37] <%SilverRoddo> Phonebook damage.
[2:01:39] <nepwar> stabby stabby kills. blunty blunty just gives big ouchie
[2:01:41] <derap41> They live long enough to be prisoners at least
[2:01:43] <Ekaelis> morningstar to the face
[2:01:45] <korperalkavage> Blunt force truama, yeesh
[2:01:46] <tdude0175> Clearly they don't die. They just get severe brain damage plague
[2:01:48] <jorniev> what about giant swords?
[2:01:49] <Getzan> Needs an execution option
[2:01:55] <%Engwithan_Elder_God> You can sell them too.
[2:01:57] <derap41> Furclad manlet
[2:01:58] <restingbones> Back then you got a small cut and died from the infection.
[2:01:58] <$sleepy_coffee> Oh man we captured all these men with the club, their bones punctured their organs!
[2:02:13] <heartlesshealer> human trafficking
[2:02:16] <Getzan> Wait, I though Gripe made a woman
[2:02:21] <Getzan> Ah there she is
[2:02:32] <derap41> Aweyeah loot
[2:02:33] <+TheStarvingGood> Top double arrows
[2:02:33] <Commissar_Cornflakes> Top right.
[2:02:47] <Ekaelis> Im disappoint Plague, why doesnt she look like Casca?
[2:02:50] <Getzan> Lady "Dethgun" LUL
[2:02:56] <%Rezca> "length"
[2:03:00] <cap_bon> Do you jsut magically heal in this or is it like dwarf fortress adventure mode were your just fucked up forever
[2:03:05] <derap41> Its armor compared to clothes
[2:03:16] <$sleepy_coffee> The length of the knobbed club
[2:03:24] <Getzan> @cap_bon regen dependant on skill
[2:03:31] <cap_bon> ah fair enough
[2:03:53] <derap41> And slowly getting rich
[2:03:58] <$sleepy_coffee> Bonking stick
[2:04:02] <derap41> Then getting an army and taking a castle
[2:04:03] <+Vestillion> just remember plague, kill for Khorne!
[2:04:11] <+PleasantLee> oh
[2:04:13] <+PleasantLee> hmm
[2:04:15] <Ekaelis> rooBonk
[2:04:20] <+PleasantLee> well I guess I'll kill myself
[2:04:21] <aeravon> This overworld bit looks like the overworld bit of Storm of Zehir, the expansion for Neverwinter Nights 2
[2:04:21] <derap41> These people didn't think farming was good enough so now they die
[2:04:25] <Getzan> I prefer Nurgle, because Covid Kappa
[2:04:25] <CyberDingus> she sounds somewhat british?
[2:04:36] <Commissar_Cornflakes> Skull.
[2:04:38] <tdude0175> Can you still make some money sell goods from one kingdom to another?
[2:04:38] <Lelfro> skull
[2:04:38] <Coystick> She out cruising for bush dick
[2:04:40] <CaptHat211> SPLIT YOUR SKULL
[2:04:41] <Getzan> skOll
[2:04:42] <jsikandere> he said he'll split yer bum
[2:04:48] <+Viny_Mars> Salt
[2:04:52] <derap41> Or they avoid it its really cool
[2:04:53] <CaptHat211> Martin Short: "Break. Your. Neck."
[2:04:55] <heartlesshealer> Horses are OP is mount & blade. You get to attack and run away at the same time
[2:04:56] <+Mashuukitty> cant you charge an attakc and change direction?
[2:04:57] <derap41> Oof
[2:05:05] <Getzan> The AI is soooooo much better
[2:05:05] <%Engwithan_Elder_God> Big damn heroes
[2:05:06] <derap41> That was kinda brutal
[2:05:10] <+EpicBigchill> The land is saved again
[2:05:13] <jsikandere> peasants start with horses now?
[2:05:14] <ThirdPersonPhil> in the last game you could do a unblockable if you rushed a bit first
[2:05:16] <nepwar> jesus that was a crubstomp symphony
[2:05:21] <Getzan> Couched the lance
[2:05:24] <restingbones> Those villeges clearly didnt have horses
[2:05:29] <derap41> Most villagers don't have horses or spears
[2:05:30] <cap_bon> How were they a threat to anyone
[2:06:06] <$sleepy_coffee> Horses be big blunts
[2:06:11] <+Remery_> Did you gain any honor? The most important stat a warrior could have?
[2:06:18] <Getzan> they probably broke into their storehouses instead of fighting the villagers
[2:06:20] <%Engwithan_Elder_God> Use your spear
[2:06:22] <derap41> @cap_bon Imagine you live in a village that shares 1 splitting axe
[2:06:43] <TheRealTuschi> is this a new release?
[2:06:48] <Getzan> Yes
[2:06:53] <Getzan> today, infact
[2:06:53] <derap41> Tactics +1
[2:06:54] <TheRealTuschi> Thanks
[2:06:56] <+EpicBigchill> Early Access
[2:07:04] <+EpicBigchill> I thought
[2:07:08] <$sleepy_coffee> I want to listen to their Doppler effect screams
[2:07:11] <Getzan> yeah EA
[2:07:15] <nepwar> LUL
[2:07:17] <+Nomenanza> I already miss the turbo close up on the bandit's potato face in dialogue boxes

[2:07:46] <%Engwithan_Elder_God> I don't think you're taking that one prisoner
[2:07:46] <crusader_heide> his mouth was full of spear!
[2:07:51] <Coystick> Mounted Combatant+Polearm Master+Sentinel stacking feats
[2:07:55] <pillowwasp> Roving bands of horsemen are a menace to society
[2:08:03] <heartlesshealer> I played it for combat
[2:08:07] <Ekaelis> i thought its because its fun
[2:08:14] <%SilverRoddo> He ain’t gonna be in Mount and Blade 3.
[2:08:14] <heartlesshealer> I remember spending hours in the dumb tournaments
[2:08:21] <CaptHat211> You gotta love how the "realistic fantasy" forgets about realism when a group of enemies on foot don't immediately get taken out by getting hit by the horses.
[2:08:25] <ThirdPersonPhil> multiplayer was fun
[2:08:27] <heartlesshealer> easy money
[2:08:40] <crusader_heide> Romanticizing crude war is sickening. I love it
[2:08:46] <nepwar> i exclusively played the dumb tournaments so i could get enough money to do stuff lol
[2:08:58] <jsikandere> good lord
[2:09:09] <derap41> Man he has some fancy clean robes

[2:09:31] <derap41> I like his 1 tooth showing
[2:09:33] <Getzan> @nepwar and honorable lord's relationship

[2:11:02] <TheRealTuschi> thats the kid from Plague tail

[2:54:42] <derap41> @Getzan she was a daughter of a retainer
[2:54:42] <Commissar_Cornflakes> She's a bailiff's daughter.
[2:54:56] <shevan123> they must've pulled all that effort and time into it
[2:54:58] <TheDastardlyD> save rocks to eat for later
[2:55:09] <derap41> Outside if tanks

[2:59:31] <nepwar> just find a top tier
[2:59:33] <$sleepy_coffee> Can you modify a pitchfork to be the soul stealer 900?
[2:59:43] <derap41> You can melt gear?
[3:00:00] <justaguy3> Do your troops need water? or they absorb water from the humidity of the ambient like some kind of man sponge
[3:00:08] <+Punishedkaiger> @PlagueOfGripes They sort of fixed that with the DLC, but it still meant that you had to know which towns had blacksmiths
[3:00:13] <Coystick> Yeesh they want $92.95 dollarydoos for 3make
[3:00:14] <%JJCheeker> plagueImoya_RB

[3:00:32] <%JailShmixRemix> plagueImoya
[3:00:39] <nepwar> holy shit in awe at the size of this lad
[3:00:50] <Daksaysso> the carpenter might do bows
[3:00:53] <cap_bon> can you build a warhammer those look sick
[3:01:01] <Yans_xc4> Maybe you need to find a fletcher to upgrade your bows
[3:01:25] <restingbones> Glaive is cool
[3:01:37] <+Punishedkaiger> This is really nice to see, they made improvements to their game
[3:02:10] <%JJCheeker> The shorter stubie looks more painful
[3:02:10] <restingbones> Decreases Handling
[3:02:23] <derap41> Jank
[3:02:37] <jsikandere> biggest rod
[3:02:45] <nepwar> what does refine do
[3:02:47] <Slack222> Must be a ratio to do with weight and reach
[3:02:53] <derap41> Could start smelting stuff
[3:03:03] <CyberDingus> also hiring K-boys
[3:03:06] <+polypolipauli> Why not buy a bow?
[3:03:11] <Fenlig> Can't you buy stuff at one town and sell at others
[3:03:14] <mighty1> buy a bow plagueImoya
[3:03:15] <%bettysharkface> Good morning
[3:03:16] <SonofStranger> @PlagueOfGripes are you a fan of the M&B series, or are you just playing this because it's new?
[3:03:24] <derap41> @Fenlig no one does that
[3:03:47] <gnollAUS> Having horses increase carrying capacity!
[3:03:50] <Commissar_Cornflakes> The thing to do in Warband was pick a faction you hate
[3:03:57] <%bettysharkface> I have no idea what this is
[3:03:58] <gnollAUS> So if you want more loot to run with, get some horses
[3:04:03] <Commissar_Cornflakes> Take a mercenary contract with whoever is at war with them
[3:04:13] <Commissar_Cornflakes> Then raid their villages and steal their butter
[3:04:18] <gnollAUS> Having horses increase carrying capacity gripes
[3:04:28] <crusader_heide> 100 years totally worth
[3:04:29] <Commissar_Cornflakes> Yup
[3:04:32] <derap41> I mean they have worked on other stuff before this right
[3:04:35] <Commissar_Cornflakes> more horses also meant faster overland speed
[3:04:38] <%bettysharkface> Oh she's cute though
[3:04:44] <Happy_Karl> 1000 years!
[3:04:48] <Commissar_Cornflakes> you wanted extra horses for swoocing away from purse users
[3:04:54] <SonofStranger> I don't know if this is just nostalgia, but I kind of prefer the simplistic visual aesthetic of M&B 1
[3:04:58] <DasLoad> the game's code needed to be folded over 1000 times in order to be perfected
[3:04:59] <gnollAUS> @PlagueOfGripes having horses gives more carrying capacity and map move speed.
[3:05:00] <CyberDingus> Plague, give your boys some studs !
[3:05:05] <derap41> wow 12k bow
[3:05:08] <gnollAUS> Stuuuuuuuuuds
[3:05:19] <LunarRemix> Like X-com?
[3:05:31] <derap41> a wooden bow being worth more than a horse is crazy
[3:05:58] <nepwar> what god level bow cost more than all the horses in stock
[3:06:03] <CyberDingus> that bow is an UZI of bows right?
[3:06:16] <+polypolipauli> Equip arrows too
[3:06:18] <derap41> 22k for a crossbow 170 for a saddled horse
[3:06:19] <Happy_Karl> Got plenty of pointy flying sticks?
[3:06:23] <SonofStranger> I always liked that you didn't need the best god tier equipment in order to play endgame mount and blade
[3:06:23] <derap41> what is this economy
[3:06:25] <gnollAUS> @PlagueOfGripes having horses gives more carrying capacity and map move speed. so if you have some spare you can carry more loots.
[3:06:27] <mighty1> equip arrows plagueImoya
[3:06:41] <LunarRemix> You can breed horses but you can't breed crossbows. Or so I've been told.
[3:06:59] <jsikandere> thats a greased up horse
[3:06:59] <CyberDingus> not THAT angle Plague !
[3:07:04] <jsikandere> mm
[3:07:14] <Commissar_Cornflakes> They did
[3:07:16] <Commissar_Cornflakes> in Warband
[3:07:18] <Yans_xc4> Ye
[3:07:24] <Commissar_Cornflakes> Horses made your party faster
[3:07:33] <derap41> Also more carry capacity
[3:07:38] <Daxalog> You digivolve them to have mounts
[3:07:39] <MurlinDurl> you can give followers horses
[3:07:47] <$sleepy_coffee> The communal horse
[3:07:49] <SonofStranger> @Commissar_Cornflakes they only made your party faster if you were carrying heavy trade goods, otherwise it didn't change
[3:07:55] <gnollAUS> Make sure to get horses, they give extra carrying capacity and up map move speed.
[3:08:07] <crusader_heide> is there save scuming?
[3:08:26] <Getzan> you pay for each "promotion"
[3:08:27] <gnollAUS> Darn gripe, read the carry capacity stuff!
[3:08:49] <gnollAUS> Looters are everywhere
[3:09:01] <+Binary_Fireball> @PlagueOfGripes can you get your own castle eventually?
[3:09:10] <+FairOnFire> Time to murder

[3:09:37] <+Binary_Fireball> dope
[3:09:43] <derap41> is there aging?
[3:09:43] <$sleepy_coffee> Their eyes look dead
[3:09:46] <Commissar_Cornflakes> Bearskin guy is too rich for these guys

[3:12:35] <gnollAUS> You can recruit them into your group, but it will lower moral to let a munch of brigands into your band.
[3:12:44] <+logoth_> same as the first game then
[3:12:46] <Yans_xc4> Repeat untill your empire covers the whole continent
[3:12:53] <+WaywardSera> basically become bandit yourself
[3:13:13] <gnollAUS> There is a fast forward button
[3:13:37] <$sleepy_coffee> Bandit killing bandits
[3:13:37] <Fenlig> I think the shield protects your back from arrows
