[0:02:18] <DeltaPangaea> Like 90% of my contact with DBD is a friend complaining about repeated survivor favoritism, so if that's true it wouldn't surprise me there's less killers.

[0:07:00] <Coystick> She sounds like she's coming out of a soviet radio, Plague sounds clear
[0:07:01] <+Axellogic> Okayish, the tinnieness makes it hard to judge before gameplay

[0:07:47] <BrachyZoid> Paige squeals to terrify the enemy

[0:10:20] <+moonunit1998> Didnâ€™t know plague did other things besides drawing
[0:10:23] <+OwlLightningMage> Pat should join the game and stop being a coward
[0:10:24] <SoFarFetched> Plague you missed out when they were making car engine noises.They HAD to remove that noise.
[0:10:26] <MarylandJutsu> well thats....thats def paige
[0:10:27] <JoshManVGH> Choo choo to scary town
[0:10:28] <+thegreenbenis> Steam powered yes.
[0:10:34] <%kyh9> My autism would compel me to play this game if they were
[0:10:37] <DeltaPangaea> Y'know it is INCREDIBLY unsafe to be working on these things while they're running.
[0:10:37] <KellBeII> do you think these generators are actually train engines? shit balls!
[0:10:42] <BrachyZoid> Oh wow that's cruel
[0:10:45] <DeltaPangaea> Someone should report this to OHS
[0:10:58] <+QueequegTheater> Anyone who isn't Cheryl is inferior
[0:11:08] <+QueequegTheater> I dig the tired aesthetic
[0:11:09] <MarylandJutsu> Paige: i'm not extra, us: points to hooker boots

[0:11:32] <+Axellogic> It sounds like you are on the phone with your victim Plague
[0:11:34] <BrachyZoid> Double pigtails just scream "I'm trying to look young"
[0:11:38] <DeltaPangaea> Plague just off in his own corner playing an entirely different game
[0:11:39] <Rozalyndis> double pigtails huh.. guess ya gotta hang on to something during the quiet time
[0:11:47] <Coystick> @KeiganOfAstora in the shed outback of Plague's land
[0:11:48] <DeltaPangaea> Just quietly winning while everyone else dies

[0:12:34] <BrachyZoid> Sacrifice Paige for the greater good
[0:12:40] <BrachyZoid> aka yourself
[0:12:44] <+QueequegTheater> I feel like most of my problems with this game stem from my hatred of headphones
[0:12:46] <MarylandJutsu> Eli would never sacrifice paige unless it was really funny
[0:12:46] <+thegreenbenis> Sacrifice Paige.
[0:12:55] <x00Leon> what rank is Paige and plague?
[0:13:01] <+Axellogic> yeeeeah frame drops!
[0:13:10] <+thegreenbenis> Glad that's not just me.
[0:13:12] <+OwlLightningMage> Eli would sacrifice any teammate if it was funny enough
[0:13:13] <BrachyZoid> So who do you think DbD is getting for the RE crossover? Mr X or Vampire Mommy?
[0:13:16] <+Axellogic> *pops confetti*
[0:13:17] <+QueequegTheater> I want Russian mommy to carry me
[0:13:26] <SoFarFetched> Well Plague's internet is still on Life Support

[0:13:44] <x00Leon> if paige wants to hide she could be a blendett
[0:13:50] <JoshManVGH> Sacrifice survivors for more time on the Internet clock!
[0:13:58] <BrachyZoid> I keep wondering if it's gonna be Mr. X or Nemesis
[0:14:00] <SoFarFetched> Im still half expecting that it's a Licker because it dug underground.

[0:53:36] <ArcanaArcade> I think they've talked about removing the leaver penalty all together.
[0:53:36] <BaronVonMagpie> should I go play killer on the off chance i run into them
[0:53:38] <SoFarFetched> I see paige was watching old Jenna Marbles v ideos

[0:55:05] <+Axellogic> I had a dream once
[0:55:07] <GrooovinMagic> A fool on the internet.
[0:55:09] <+Axellogic> It was horrible
[0:55:20] <Coystick> Bruce has done all of Ash's lines in  every vidya he's been in from memory
[0:55:28] <T_Sasquatch> Plague is about to draw Kappa

[0:56:04] <SuperVaderMan> Clown doctor cat
[0:56:09] <SoFarFetched> Soon Paige goes into her Joe Pesci accent going " I'm funny how? I mean funny, like I'm a clown? I amuse you? "
[0:56:13] <+Scevda> Gets hit.
[0:56:24] <GrooovinMagic> Catgirl doctor clown.
[0:56:25] <Parapattern> The clown comes in and bites you
[0:56:31] <Jaysky> Those are Mime Game +

[0:56:44] <+spongeofmystery> Abstract Mime
[0:56:49] <PinoProxie> she carbon dated it
[0:56:52] <+Scevda> I want a matching soundtrack.
[0:57:07] <SoFarFetched> the mime she dated didn't need to talk,because she did ALLLL of the talking Kappa
[0:57:09] <Parapattern> Paige really has only dated clowns, huh. Even got engaged to one.
[0:57:22] <Coystick> Big lady
[0:57:50] <+RealThiele> mommy milkers as killer would be amazing
[0:58:08] <SoFarFetched> There's usually a gen there at times
[0:58:10] <+spongeofmystery> Started playing DbD recently and I am also bad at the game
[0:58:40] <SoFarFetched> yeah DbD can hit you hard with the learning curve,cause you can barely start out and get a high rank killer.
[0:58:50] <Pappajimbo> heyyah!
[0:58:56] <SoFarFetched> I always feel bad when I get matched with low ranks
[0:59:05] <Coystick> Isn't DbD about to do a Resident Evil thing?
[0:59:15] <+RealThiele> yes
[0:59:27] <Coystick> It's so gonna be Lady D
[0:59:31] <SoFarFetched> yeah there's gonna be a reveal in late May,with the DLC coming out in June
[0:59:54] <Devbob98> Paige is summoned by singing
[1:00:04] <SoFarFetched> I still have money on Rebecca Chambers being the Survivor
[1:00:05] <ArcanaArcade> It feels like certain perks are a huge factor a lot of the time too.
[1:00:15] <Jaysky> Dommy mommy huntress
[1:00:21] <SoFarFetched> Oh yeah there's definitely certain perks that are top picks.
[1:00:31] <SoFarFetched> There's a site that shows top/low tier perks
[1:00:38] <ZegarWildheart> Howdy Plague
[1:01:01] <+ssjklyco> You did an enema?
[1:01:07] <SoFarFetched> you cleanse totems if the killer is *really* bad in case of NOED
[1:01:13] <Coystick> a deep cleanse
[1:01:27] <ArcanaArcade> But I mean like it seems if a killer spawns next to you and finds you within the first minute, unless you have certain perks you can't get away even if you're pretty good.
[1:01:46] <%kyh9> Can you believe that they made Huntress, but less hot as the new Killer?
[1:01:50] <Zebroneath> inb4 Iron Maiden
[1:02:01] <+Scevda> The groans in this game are somewhat...sexual.
[1:02:03] <%kyh9> It'll be FIIIIINE
[1:02:07] <Jaysky> She doesn't get many opportunities to sing for people
[1:02:22] <Coystick> no one better be stream sniping gentle plague

[1:10:24] <+Standing_Tough> hello

[1:12:54] <SoFarFetched> probably because its considering you a coward geefPoint
[1:12:56] <Samex_Comex> Starlink has been much better the last couple of months before it dropped like crazy, I have not tested a stream yet though
[1:12:56] <KellBeII> in theory its really good but it caters to interactions quite a bit
[1:13:17] <ArcanaArcade> It wants you to kinda get your hands dirty and distract the killer at some point
[1:13:35] <@Nightbot> Plague is a youtube animator and also streams at https://picarto.tv/Plague . Also: t-shirts! http://goo.gl/lze8QO
[1:15:06] <+MidnightBurst12> oh

[1:15:23] <+Scevda> Eli: Oh no...well then.

[1:15:39] <SoFarFetched> "oooo chainsaw this luscious ass BIlly~"

[1:25:18] <+Scevda> Was duchess actually a plastic bag?

[1:33:55] <@Nightbot> Plague is a youtube animator and also streams at https://picarto.tv/Plague . Also: t-shirts! http://goo.gl/lze8QO
[1:34:53] <marklarphd> Clicked on this stream just to see how many frames would drop
[1:34:58] <SoFarFetched> "My pussy is aching for more pokemon!"
[1:36:03] <SoFarFetched> a new record
[1:36:09] <Sol_Install> lol spyro plague
[1:36:10] <Sol_Install> and yoyo
[1:36:17] <AncelDeLambert> wtf is Plague's face on
[1:36:21] <Samex_Comex> Look at those pistons go
[1:36:22] <marklarphd> Wow that's a lot less frames than the last time I watched Plague stream
[1:36:35] <cherrycottontail> a spyro halloween costume
[1:36:43] <cherrycottontail> aand/or pajamas
[1:37:10] <Samex_Comex> He is wearing the spyro outfit right now
[1:37:13] <AncelDeLambert> Plague is hooked on this game
[1:37:15] <AncelDeLambert> hurr hurr
[1:37:16] <SoFarFetched> I always like how kates groans sound like they're overriding
[1:37:28] <vonmaultke> this game feels like cancer
[1:37:36] <Sol_Install> paige the goldish
[1:37:41] <Sol_Install> goldfish*
[1:37:52] <Explodincatz> i feel your pain Plague
[1:38:56] <SoFarFetched> The censorship in DbD is REALLY bad right now
[1:38:59] <SoFarFetched> geefBruh
[1:39:03] <+Scevda> Nah
[1:39:06] <SuperVaderMan> it can be rude if it obviously wasn't a good game
[1:39:11] <GrooovinMagic> That's the best way to go about life Paige
[1:39:12] <SoFarFetched> after chat censored "pick me up" so it sounded like I said something bad
[1:39:35] <+CapOfAllFools> "gg ez" is rude, typically, but I think "wp" is usually sincere or complimentary.
[1:39:38] <+Scevda> Ggwp is basic courtesy ggez is basic snide commentary
[1:39:49] <Samex_Comex> Butch was the killer
[1:39:51] <+Scevda> Butch is cat yes?
[1:39:52] <Hydrapissed> gg NO REE
[1:40:13] <Hydrapissed> ur the dog now man
[1:40:26] <+Scevda> Dangir
[1:40:36] <Murphio_GS> Butch isn't Eli's name for Peach? Awww
[1:40:48] <nomolomo> have you seen much of the new killer yet?
[1:40:50] <+Scevda> Lol
[1:40:53] <AncelDeLambert> I vote for calling Paige "Butch"
[1:41:04] <marklarphd> Mustard Queen
[1:41:30] <SoFarFetched> Who is Butch and who is Cassidy? Who gets the smoker voice?
[1:41:31] <Coystick> "Hey you in the bushes"
[1:41:39] <vonmaultke> the butchening
[1:41:40] <AncelDeLambert> Hells yeah, call the Big and Strong "Butch" like she deserves
[1:42:07] <Jontman42> Pat said you're (both) smelly
[1:42:11] <+Scevda> What pizza do you go with down in the south?
[1:42:20] <Samex_Comex> I think Butch is the only pet you told us the name of other then Candlestick
[1:42:20] <+Scevda> Whats even good down there?
[1:42:38] <nomolomo> lots of brothers being nuts around here
[1:43:08] <Murphio_GS> Chicky
[1:43:08] <SoFarFetched> oh me and Jenna have chickens together Paige geefPlz
[1:43:23] <Samex_Comex> Candlestick was a cat with it's hair missing from the tip their tail?
[1:43:23] <+Scevda> All paige names too
[1:43:29] <jasmoumou> Does your brother knows you are a furry ðŸ˜‚ðŸ˜‚
[1:43:48] <SoFarFetched> They are our children on our little farm on Stardew
[1:43:57] <AncelDeLambert> oh, Stardew
[1:44:01] <DeltaPangaea> My mom keeps chickens. She also got some ducks recently.
[1:44:05] <AncelDeLambert> FETCHED I WAS GONNA DEMAND PICTURES
[1:44:11] <aiutare47> Donâ€™t you live in the suburbs?
[1:44:17] <+Scevda> Not likely to be able to have kitchens in montreal?
[1:44:19] <SoFarFetched> @AncelDeLambert honestly I would if I could,Id love to have a chicken
[1:44:24] <+Scevda> Oh okay
[1:44:35] <Murphio_GS> FrÃ¨re d'Eli is what I'll call him since I don't think I've ever heard his name
[1:44:39] <vonmaultke> My mate has 4 chickens in his town house backyard
[1:44:52] <SoFarFetched> if I EVER got a chicken,I'd totally show it off
[1:45:14] <aiutare47> Chickens are nice, the water defrosting sucks though
[1:45:18] <AncelDeLambert> BUTCH DOWN, BUTCH DOWN!

[1:45:50] <+Scevda> I want to boop the snoot
[1:45:53] <nomolomo> pitiful killer
[1:46:17] <Samex_Comex> We had a male and female Hooded Merganser's show up at our pond
[1:46:20] <cap_bon> Does the killer get more points for dragging the game out and not just trying to end it instantly
[1:46:49] <nomolomo> yes the killer gets more points for chasing survivors for longer etc.
[1:47:20] <DeltaPangaea> It makes sense in lore if I recall.
[1:47:28] <Coystick> Plague's isp is the real killer
[1:47:35] <DeltaPangaea> Doesn't THE ENTITY mostly just care about emotions and the killing is just a formality?
[1:47:51] <DeltaPangaea> So fucking about is what it wants you to do.
[1:48:33] <+Prattlesworth> Oops
[1:48:37] <nomolomo> right it feeds on desperation and such right?
[1:48:43] <+Scevda> ~Oh nooo chase me, chase me!~
[1:48:53] <Samex_Comex> The killer smells the pizza
[1:48:58] <nomolomo> more fear = more yummies for entity-chan
[1:49:16] <cap_bon> Chase me chase me, oh no please dont look in this murder closet
[1:50:15] <AncelDeLambert> are Plague and Butch gonna be streaming long?
[1:50:34] <SoFarFetched> boop her snoot
[1:50:50] <ArcanaArcade> Amanda is cute
[1:51:27] <GrooovinMagic> She escaped
[1:52:06] <nomolomo> paige the sabatour
[1:52:39] <+Scevda> Its to make up for her lack of map knowledge
[1:53:00] <Coystick> Tummy
[1:53:35] <nomolomo> claim it eli its yours
[1:54:07] <+Scevda> Sounds like a euphemism.
[1:54:21] <+Scevda> June 9th, hodl
[1:54:43] <Palmtuna> Whose Pat?
[1:54:43] <SoFarFetched> I have too many streams on
[1:54:52] <Palmtuna> The angry one?

[1:55:54] <nomolomo> dat purple haze
[1:56:16] <SoFarFetched> Claudette makes me think to the Roy Orbison song
[1:56:21] <+Scevda> Nah nah in general
[1:56:25] <Laecerelius> Bowsette?
[1:56:51] <DeltaPangaea> Bowsette's inferior to a koopafied Peach anyway.
[1:56:54] <AncelDeLambert> look at that clown suit
[1:56:56] <Palmtuna> Boba Fette
[1:57:05] <AncelDeLambert> wow, throwing knives
[1:57:11] <SoFarFetched> his chase music is great
[1:57:13] <nomolomo> he suuucks
[1:57:15] <AncelDeLambert> so... a fast version of Huntress
[1:57:17] <DeltaPangaea> I've heard kpop man is bad.
[1:57:25] <SoFarFetched> he's getting a buff later
[1:57:26] <nomolomo> too bad because he looks pretty cool
[1:57:29] <DeltaPangaea> Since he needs 8 knives to wound someone apparently
[1:57:35] <+Scevda> Oh no a K-pop stan! Run for your lives!
[1:57:39] <nomolomo> yeah wounding someone with the knives takes forever
[1:57:55] <DeltaPangaea> And they fall off after... 20 seconds or something? Iunno
[1:57:56] <SoFarFetched> think they're also planning to nerf Irid hatchets for huntress
[1:58:00] <AncelDeLambert> he smoked too much of the pop star meth
[1:58:01] <nomolomo> hes kinda like a worse huntress
