[1:42:29] <Murphio_GS> I do like the music in these games tho
[1:42:48] <rdddy> maybe the game is so terrible because the actual players is supposed to be the last victim
[1:42:53] <Spagheddies> P sure the bots are small.
[1:43:04] <Dlent_> Nah, the bots are tiny.

[1:49:51] <rdddy> watching terrible isekai is the input
[1:50:22] <hamahiroyuki> I legitimately think Eli is too smart for this game. Most ppl get entertained by this game.
[1:51:09] <hamahiroyuki> I know he's hell way smarter than me at least.
[1:51:16] <+Mekhet09> Could be a 2.
[1:52:00] <rdddy> the word fake is hidden by the blood splatter kek
[1:52:18] <derg0ns> oh this the room with the most confusing puzzle in the game

[2:10:24] <+Mekhet09> I think it's letters.
[2:10:55] <%Bigchill___> did the camera have anything on it?
[2:11:14] <sadboy_otoroshi> There's letters that we counted are above 9. That's not it.
[2:11:58] <%cosmicleviathan18> Since when was Saturn bigger than Jupiter?
[2:12:04] <+Mekhet09> I'd try letters.
[2:12:36] <RunningNGunning> POOP
[2:12:54] <%Bigchill___> is it litterally just listing the letters of the planets in order?
[2:12:55] <%Revan175757> oh man it's dumber than that Eli

[2:13:09] <%Revan175757> it's so dumb

[2:13:15] <sadboy_otoroshi> S M V M E M J S
[2:13:24] <%Revan175757> ^^

[2:14:23] <Badpest> Badpest subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 5 months! 
[2:14:28] <+Axellogic> My brain thinks its the 4 walls but ciphered
[2:14:34] <Gigagoat> if its hope BOP
[2:14:44] <+Axellogic> Im likely wrong
[2:14:57] <vindibeard> what if it's the password from the first game, and the dev hates people who play out of order PogChamp
[2:15:15] <+bitstorm_> oooooohh
[2:15:18] <+Mekhet09> I think the 6 stands for how many letters you need.
[2:15:34] <%Revan175757> V E M J is the answer i think
[2:15:36] <vindibeard> E E L N A T S manSPIDER
[2:15:36] <+Mekhet09> Letters need to be the passwards.
[2:15:44] <+Axellogic> hmmm
[2:15:57] <+bitstorm_> yeah im also thinking it might be as stupid as uncompress
[2:16:01] <%Revan175757> or S M V E M J S
[2:16:06] <+Mekhet09> SMVEMJS
[2:16:28] <%Bigchill___> was it not VEMJ?
[2:16:37] <+bitstorm_> he just tried VEMJ right? or am i mistaken
[2:16:41] <+Mekhet09> It's the letters plus the ones in there.
[2:16:49] <%Revan175757> cause its in order from smaller to bigger
[2:16:50] <@Nightbot> Plague is a youtube animator and also streams at https://picarto.tv/Plague . Also: t-shirts! http://goo.gl/lze8QO
[2:16:53] <sadboy_otoroshi> Is the first letter of each of the planets.
[2:17:09] <rdddy> what just happened
[2:17:19] <+Mekhet09> SUN MERCURY VENUS EARTH MARS JUPITER SATURN.
[2:17:19] <Spagheddies> Plague's internet happened.
[2:17:20] <Kkeyf> ooooh boy
[2:17:25] <Gigagoat> rip
[2:17:34] <%cosmicleviathan18> NOOOO WHAT WAS THE PASWORD?!
[2:17:37] <%Revan175757> just trust us ok
[2:17:39] <+Mekhet09> At this point I just think he needs to go to bed if it's late.
[2:17:42] <%Bigchill___> Sun and saturn?
[2:17:43] <sadboy_otoroshi> Thanks verizon!!!
[2:17:56] <%cosmicleviathan18> oh refresh and we back
[2:17:57] <%Revan175757> it's S M V E M J S let's get through this xD
[2:18:12] <sadboy_otoroshi> The passaword is only 4 digits.
[2:18:17] <+Axellogic> Its just the planets eh
[2:18:28] <%Bigchill___> do we know how many characters you can enter?
[2:18:56] <vindibeard> if you remember the button for the text log history, monomi said something that might help undo the overthink
[2:19:28] <%cosmicleviathan18> mars? LUL
[2:19:47] <Spagheddies> TBH I recall just bruteforcing the password at this point.
[2:20:04] <+takotoots> takotoots subscribed at Tier 1. 
[2:20:07] <%Revan175757> compress = unhide letters i think
[2:20:10] <vindibeard> it's probably way up there at this point though :P
[2:20:16] <rdddy> the actual password is ALTF4
[2:20:18] <%Revan175757> uncompress  = unhide
[2:20:37] <Skeletonmanners> Droppedframa 2
[2:20:39] <%Bigchill___> is there a picture past the bars?
[2:20:40] <BananaAssasine> @Revan175757 was this already tried?
[2:20:51] <sadboy_otoroshi> 2 frame rompa
[2:20:52] <+sinistersally> could it be SM(letters of the planets)S
[2:20:59] <+Mekhet09> just enter the planets plague. ALL 7 of them.
[2:21:15] <+SaintPyre> this is one of the more like, painful things they attempted in the series -- I had to look up a guide and even then it was a bit rough
[2:21:22] <%Revan175757> Banana Plague doesnt want to do that just yet for some reason
[2:21:25] <%cosmicleviathan18> the did also ask you if you wanted to skip this part. Probably because they know it wasn't that good bo8Bsmug bo8Bsmug bo8Bsmug
[2:21:42] <sadboy_otoroshi> Try 1234 and ABCD
[2:21:57] <%Revan175757> S M V E M J S is the answer though
[2:22:04] <+SaintPyre> i mean, do you want a hint on it? i think i remember it ( i do not know the rules of backseating and all, if its against the rules my bad)
[2:22:33] <vindibeard> the part where monomi says "oh it's the weekdays, so SMTWTFSS" and nagito's like nope
[2:22:34] <rdddy> maybe the planets are in the wrrong order...
[2:22:56] <%cosmicleviathan18> I hate this riddle ryboogFace ryboogFace ryboogFace
[2:23:03] <+Axellogic> I guess the cipher is just to show its only the first letter
[2:23:03] <sadboy_otoroshi> No fuckin way, Thye card was a red herring.
[2:23:04] <BananaAssasine> to get the last and first character
[2:23:04] <%Revan175757> YES IT IS STUPID DANGANRONPA
[2:23:09] <%Bigchill___> Binary!
[2:23:10] <ArkhamMike2> NotLikeThis NotLikeThis NotLikeThis
[2:23:11] <%cosmicleviathan18> so unsatisfying
[2:23:15] <rdddy> omfg
[2:23:23] <%cosmicleviathan18> pain
[2:23:31] <rdddy> remember this game is prolly made for 10 year olds
[2:23:34] <Spagheddies> So they just gave you the card too early.
[2:23:34] <+Mekhet09> No.
[2:23:36] <+SaintPyre> flavor text on the card? idk it looked pretty on the card
[2:23:40] <Ayralynn> The card told you the number of characters in the password and hinted that it was the first letters.
[2:23:45] <rdddy> so they gave an extra hint that confuses nontodlers
[2:23:52] <%Revan175757> i said uncompress = unhide cause english puns are bad to translate from japanese
[2:23:54] <+Mekhet09> That's just to tell you that it's every letter.
[2:24:00] <vindibeard> maybe rdddy
[2:24:00] <%Bigchill___> we have no more business with thes!
[2:24:18] <rdddy> @vindibeard i dont see anything making more sense then that^^
[2:24:45] <%Revan175757> it's just stupid Eli we are with you
[2:24:49] <%Bigchill___> I think the flashing lights on the panel is the answer for it
[2:24:53] <Spagheddies> It really just should've said "Password." The "Unhide/uncompress" part adds literally nothing.
[2:24:55] <Kkeyf> things are mostly less complicated than one might think
[2:24:56] <+Mekhet09> This is for the wall password.
[2:25:02] <RunningNGunning> I'm just glad that the 999 series conveys its information in its puzzles much better than this
[2:25:06] <%Revan175757> this is the final
[2:25:17] <%Bigchill___> The rabbit said that you don't need the cipher anymore
[2:25:33] <sadboy_otoroshi> Go to ResidentSleeper  Plague!!
[2:25:39] <%Revan175757> NO
[2:25:42] <Spagheddies> Uchikoshi knows how to make a fucking escape room. Wild how he and Kodaka are friends, and the guy couldn't even ask for a consultation.
[2:25:43] <+Mekhet09> It corresponds to the blinking lights. Since the rabbit said the lights had something to do with it.
[2:25:49] <%Bigchill___> @PlagueOfGripes I think the flashing lights on the panel is what you need to use
[2:25:59] <%Revan175757> laptop = wall password
[2:26:14] <+Mekhet09> No.
[2:26:19] <+Mekhet09> The other wall.
[2:26:26] <Spagheddies> Wall password, I think they mean the door panel.
[2:26:42] <%Revan175757> yeah laptop = door panel, sorry
[2:26:44] <rdddy> they should imprement this room in the next saw movie....
[2:26:53] <sadboy_otoroshi> To open the laptop
[2:26:54] <+Mekhet09> You did.
[2:27:07] <Kkeyf> those are possible patterns of something that appears in the room
[2:27:13] <+Mekhet09> Scissors on wall since it's the only item left.
[2:27:28] <%glasschin> glasschin subscribed with Prime. 
[2:27:39] <%cosmicleviathan18> stab the panel
[2:27:46] <Samex_Comex> So the lights match the dots?
[2:28:14] <%Revan175757> The lock shows you a pattern of blinking light that you must use the computer to decipher
[2:28:39] <%Revan175757> into 4 numbers if i remember correctly
[2:29:00] <Spagheddies> God that'd be so stupid.
[2:29:22] <%Revan175757> they do Eli
[2:29:26] <%cosmicleviathan18> is it the ones that don't turn on?
[2:29:37] <%glasschin> think like a japanese
[2:29:47] <+Mekhet09> Try stabbing the panel.
[2:29:50] <Phob05> It looks like its in base 4
[2:29:55] <Kkeyf> that could be an idea
[2:30:04] <vindibeard> sting like a spanish
[2:30:15] <Spagheddies> You could always use the scissors to kill Nagito.
[2:30:21] <Spagheddies> In fact, you should do that.
[2:30:34] <%Revan175757> ask for help when you need it
[2:30:38] <%cosmicleviathan18> try stabbing yourself, maybe that's the answer, death
[2:31:24] <+Mekhet09> You use it.
[2:31:34] <%Revan175757> The lock shows you a pattern of blinking light that you must use the computer to decipher into 4 numbers if i remember correctly
[2:32:03] <nasxy> cirNom
[2:32:17] <%Revan175757> lol
[2:32:20] <franctastic_> NotLikeThis NotLikeThis NotLikeThis
[2:32:23] <+Mekhet09> Yeah I found the answer and I don't even know how you get it.
[2:32:52] <Spagheddies> But even then, there's one sequence that doesn't make sense.
[2:32:59] <Spagheddies> One part of*
[2:33:15] <%Revan175757> do you want the numbers that you get from deciphering?
[2:33:27] <%Revan175757> cause fuck this game?
[2:33:37] <rdddy> what on earth is this nonsense..
[2:33:48] <vindibeard> @Mekhet09 i saw someone else play this, and writing it down got them there eventually
[2:34:04] <Phob05> My theory leads my into the double digits so idk
[2:34:22] <sadboy_otoroshi> 2 lights at the right last should be 13.
[2:34:24] <+Mekhet09> @vindibeard I just found out how it works and I'm mad.
[2:34:32] <%Bigchill___> this was not well thought out
[2:34:41] <vindibeard> LUL
[2:34:48] <Kkeyf> it's just a representation
[2:34:50] <+Mekhet09> @PlagueOfGripes The one hint I have is put it in a 4 x4 grid.
[2:34:57] <Spagheddies> Yeah, no, jesus fucking H.
[2:35:01] <+Mekhet09> And that's how you get the answer.'
[2:35:05] <%cosmicleviathan18> I feel like I've aged 5 years trying to figure this out ryboogFace
[2:35:12] <%Revan175757> the problem is that i dont believe that NAGITO is able to figure this fucking shit out
[2:35:16] <Spagheddies> And as for the laptop, they should've just blacked the screen out.
[2:35:17] <BR0Speedwagon> ???
[2:35:18] <RunningNGunning> These were originally PS Vita games I think so I don't think it was intended for you to read it from a distance cause it would be too small to read
[2:35:22] <sadboy_otoroshi> I think the penultimate light flash is 13.
[2:35:33] <BR0Speedwagon> I think you may be overthinking it a bit
[2:35:42] <%Revan175757> he is overthinking it
[2:35:48] <laserbeaming> press stuff until it's fixed
[2:35:56] <vindibeard> and they made it seem like nagito figured it out in seconds too, right after looking at it
[2:36:06] <BR0Speedwagon> I just got here, so I am a bit uncertain as to the progress made in the room overall.
[2:36:16] <BR0Speedwagon> But I don't remember this being that hard.
[2:36:34] <%Revan175757> incorrect lol
[2:36:38] <+Axellogic> 2 as well
[2:36:54] <%Bigchill___> This is great . .
[2:36:59] <+Axellogic> this is fun
[2:37:03] <%cosmicleviathan18> did Plague just slap himself?
[2:37:04] <BR0Speedwagon> Have you tried turning it off and on again?
[2:37:07] <sadboy_otoroshi> This is fuckin binary numbing. Just pull a chart.
[2:37:10] <BR0Speedwagon> Works on my machine
[2:37:16] <%boatzndhoez> plagueGripes
[2:37:19] <rdddy> @BR0Speedwagon kek
[2:37:26] <chidory000> this is some content right here
[2:37:29] <laserbeaming> what's Othello? a game?
[2:37:30] <%Revan175757> WRONG
[2:37:39] <+Mekhet09> It's unfortunately not how it works.
[2:37:54] <%Bigchill___> a 3 and a backwards 3
[2:37:58] <%Revan175757> Eli please just cheat. Do what Pat does best
[2:38:00] <Spagheddies> There's no inverse of three, though.
[2:38:11] <%Bigchill___> I joke
[2:38:21] <vindibeard> at this point there must be a search party looking for nagito
[2:38:22] <Kkeyf> it's kinda bad but you need to take another step logically
[2:38:23] <Spagheddies> It doesn't.
[2:38:26] <Spagheddies> It doesn't work.
[2:38:34] <+Mekhet09> https://gameplay.tips/uploads/posts/2019-05/1558629584_6.jpg
[2:38:35] <Ferakin> Have you tried stacking the sequences in the manner of a 4x4 grid?
[2:38:36] <Kkeyf> maybe try looking only one digit at a time?
[2:38:39] <+Mekhet09> This is how you get the answer.
[2:38:56] <Kkeyf> like, just the first blinking dot?
[2:39:24] <%cosmicleviathan18> Stonks
[2:39:30] <%Revan175757> final dead room
[2:39:32] <BR0Speedwagon> The Final Dead Room
[2:39:37] <+Axellogic> yep I figured it out and I hate it
[2:39:38] <Skeletonmanners> just clown room? thought it was the clown game
[2:39:46] <sadboy_otoroshi> 11,2,3,12.
[2:39:49] <nasxy> it does work though lol. you either get it or you dont cirNom
[2:39:50] <%Revan175757> lol
[2:39:53] <+RigmaroleHM> Ah, of course
[2:39:54] <+Mekhet09> https://gameplay.tips/uploads/posts/2019-05/1558629584_6.jpg
[2:39:54] <%cosmicleviathan18> WAT?!
[2:39:58] <sadboy_otoroshi> Let's see....
[2:39:58] <+Mekhet09> This is how you get it.
[2:40:08] <vindibeard> the dead zone OpieOP
[2:40:09] <rdddy> this cat thing is starting to creep me out...
[2:40:11] <%Bigchill___> how?
[2:40:12] <%Revan175757> we saw righeous indignation xD
[2:40:13] <+Axellogic> the lights blink corresponding to where they are top to down
[2:40:16] <sadboy_otoroshi> HOW?????
[2:40:18] <+Mossinoda> ¯\_(ツ)_/¯
[2:40:26] <%cosmicleviathan18> my brain suffers
[2:40:30] <+RigmaroleHM> Was it an addition thing?
[2:40:33] <Kkeyf> it does but in a different way
[2:40:40] <franctastic_> NotLikeThis
[2:40:41] <+Mekhet09> It is.
[2:40:44] <glass_marcus> it's so visually convoluted? why do it this way?
[2:40:48] <+Mekhet09> Look at it vertically.
[2:40:48] <%cosmicleviathan18> I feel like I've wasted 5 years ryboogFace LUL
[2:40:51] <Spagheddies> I'm not sure exactly how you're supposed to get to what's shown on that picture.
[2:41:01] <+Axellogic> The first light is only light on the first and last
[2:41:03] <nasxy> hes gonna be mind blown when he finds out lol
[2:41:06] <+Axellogic> thus 9
[2:41:07] <rdddy> this is so dumb fck me
[2:41:10] <sadboy_otoroshi> This doesn't make sense.
[2:41:15] <Spagheddies> It's like red herring on top of red herring on top of broken logic.
[2:41:16] <+Mekhet09> Uh look at it vertically plague.
[2:41:29] <Ferakin> You put the sequences below each other in order and look at them vertically
[2:41:39] <+RigmaroleHM> "But can you SPELL knife?"
[2:41:53] <TheAntiNihilist> you choose the numbers that aren't anywhere in the room?
[2:42:10] <+Axellogic> The trick is the vertical lights were not the numbers they filled it top to bottom and you had to write it down
[2:42:22] <+Axellogic> I hate it but I got it
[2:42:25] <%Bigchill___> You have to later the blinking lights on top each other in order to show the actual light combination?
[2:42:28] <+RigmaroleHM> "It's too smart for you people"
[2:42:30] <+Mekhet09> Plague you put the numbers in horizontally, and you get the numbers vertically.
[2:42:31] <%Bigchill___> layer*
[2:42:33] <+Mossinoda> "I got it on my first try" headass
[2:42:33] <Spagheddies> How the fuck is anyone supposed to see those and go "Ah, yes, I am not supposed to look at it the way it is presented to me."
[2:42:36] <Murphio_GS> Fuck that one guy
[2:42:38] <Kkeyf> I can see that
[2:42:41] <+SaintPyre> i enjoy the danganrompa series at times, and i agree this room is kinda bullshit
[2:42:42] <vindibeard> so you know how there are four blinks, the four blinking dots are separate. i hate it too
[2:42:52] <%Revan175757> no he means vertical lights in the laptop
[2:42:59] <BR0Speedwagon> Apartment complex? I find it quite simple really.
[2:43:06] <laserbeaming> flip your screen 90 degrees
[2:43:07] <+Mekhet09> Look at the chart I posted.
[2:43:11] <%Bigchill___> you wrote the lights out one top of each other to give the actual combo
[2:43:12] <+ForlornCarton> The order the lights flash above each individual number is the pattern
[2:43:17] <%LuxCelestia> Wow. I just realized how it's meant to be done and holy shit is it dumb
[2:43:19] <+Axellogic> The light blinks 4 times and you have to stack them vertically underneath each other
[2:43:26] <Spagheddies> @BR0Speedwagon KEKW
[2:43:26] <das_paife> the first light blinks four times
[2:43:29] <%cosmicleviathan18> LUL
[2:43:38] <+Axellogic> I hate it but I did get it
[2:43:45] <%caramello_man> smol kitty
[2:43:46] <%cosmicleviathan18> thank the Lord that music is done with
[2:43:48] <Spagheddies> Now you can finally kill Nagito.
[2:43:48] <%Revan175757> b-but Eli you already have it
[2:43:53] <Kkeyf> Time to shootbang!
[2:44:04] <Phob05> A freaking gun!
[2:44:06] <vindibeard> at least the last puzzle was spoiler proof, there's no way to convey it in the language  PRChase
[2:44:31] <sadboy_otoroshi> Goddamit Dungeon Grandpas 2 you did it again.
[2:44:38] <rdddy> using my tongue on my empty coke bottle is more fun then this
[2:45:11] <TheAntiNihilist> I forget, what happened to this being a murder investigation game?
[2:45:12] <%boatzndhoez> plagueFace
[2:45:25] <+RigmaroleHM> Is "Russian Roulette" copyrighted or something?
[2:45:34] <%cosmicleviathan18> ztbDead ztbDead ztbDead
[2:45:41] <Spagheddies> @RigmaroleHM No that's just Kodaka things.
[2:45:51] <%cosmicleviathan18> ztbMurder ztbMurder ztbMurder
[2:45:52] <sadboy_otoroshi> What is the PG rating of this game?
[2:45:53] <%Revan175757> the entire point of this section is to show us how fucking cool and awesome Nagito is and i hate it
[2:46:08] <Phob05> Maybe you should stack the bullets in a 4x4 grid
[2:46:22] <%cosmicleviathan18> point it at her and pull the trigger 6 times
[2:46:52] <rdddy> omfg
[2:47:02] <rdddy> exactly
[2:47:10] <%Revan175757> cause Nagito is SO COOL
[2:47:14] <%boatzndhoez> pvpH

[2:47:28] <Skeletonmanners> its him, living in society man
[2:47:29] <Murphio_GS> Ah yes, Children love suicide
[2:47:38] <sadboy_otoroshi> Imagine having 5/6 chance, that's the stuff.
[2:47:39] <Kkeyf> that's when you set both difficulties on mean at the start of the game!
[2:47:42] <Phob05> Do it, Nagito!
[2:47:42] <rdddy> id load 6 at this point tbh
[2:47:50] <sadboy_otoroshi> Rated M actually.
[2:48:01] <+Mekhet09> Yes.
[2:48:01] <pawbgles> ah yes, Dingo ringo. the greatest game
[2:48:09] <BR0Speedwagon> The ultimate dumb luck student
[2:48:19] <Gigagoat> They absolutely would

[2:48:26] <TheAntiNihilist> no. he's the ultimate emo
[2:48:31] <%boatzndhoez> pvpSK

[2:49:05] <%Revan175757> ....ugh
[2:49:06] <%Artista_AF> yep
[2:49:07] <%Bigchill___> He would be more lucky if he did get the bullet
[2:49:15] <%Bigchill___> since its the lower chance
[2:49:19] <hamahiroyuki> rEmemBEr hIs POweR? iT is LUcK!

[2:49:45] <Phob05> Shouldnt he have used 6 bullets, if he's that lucky the gun wouldve just missfired

[2:49:51] <Murphio_GS> I want to die multiple times

[2:50:29] <TheAntiNihilist> yeah me too
[2:50:38] <Kkeyf> "I got really excited! So I pulled it twice!"

[2:51:08] <rdddy> is there a dlc or something where he just dies?
[2:52:04] <%boatzndhoez> it looks like an asshole
[2:52:09] <+RigmaroleHM> It's pretty gross yeah
[2:52:11] <Spagheddies> Fuck the rabbit, you should've shot Nagito five more times.
