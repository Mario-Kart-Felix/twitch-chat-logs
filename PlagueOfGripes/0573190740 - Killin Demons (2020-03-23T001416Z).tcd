[0:03:04] <reinbachthe3rd> I'm on 100% telework for the foreseeable future, and it's not really my thing. I prefer to go into the office, but I work with the public, so we can't stay open.

[0:09:29] <thiccguy305> it's herpes
[0:09:39] <TheAsylumCat> portal penises
[0:09:40] <StrawberryLion> Those were there before the invasion
[0:09:46] <HelghastTroop> i think the doom guy was more concerned with what he does with is arms then his legs
[0:09:53] <cap_bon> Cancer Void Gate Hell Spawn Tumors Mark of the Wolf
[0:10:01] <otakon17> HeyGuys
[0:10:08] <%Megabulldog> Big pp
[0:10:08] <HelghastTroop> you can lower difficulty if you really dont care

[0:10:20] <StrawberryLion> Doom nap
[0:10:21] <zepie__> I have big pee pee
[0:10:25] <$daveronald> not into Animal Crossing like everyone else on twitch?
[0:10:37] <%DaKnightWarrior> Speedrun time Kappa
[0:11:04] <StrawberryLion> Play in baby mode
[0:11:27] <HelghastTroop> i agree just make it lower so you dont have to care
[0:11:36] <cap_bon> Im not sure I enjoy the new game loop that much
[0:11:37] <otakon17> aye
[0:11:51] <Sundaysmiles01> he'd wreck shit if you'd get gud :P
[0:12:09] <redrix_3> if everything's too easy then things get boring
[0:12:35] <StrawberryLion> Can't spoil but maybe come back.
[0:12:40] <$daveronald> I'm guessing IDDQD doesn't work
[0:12:45] <otakon17> You must find...your groooooooooove
[0:12:51] <TheAsylumCat> first person perspective platforming people
[0:12:55] <$Rezca> too early for that 1up I believe
[0:13:05] <+Pookiedaexzile> I camehere just to see if it was possible to be such a grouche you hate this game
[0:13:13] <+Pookiedaexzile> I am not disaappointed
[0:13:27] <$eco419> I am
[0:13:30] <StrawberryLion> Look plague is putting on the show for us, dance boy dance.
[0:13:34] <otakon17> I do like how the weapons are color coded so you can like GET what you're picking up without looking at icons
[0:13:41] <$Rezca> not 'woke
[0:13:54] <TheAsylumCat> not a morning person
[0:14:02] <otakon17> did the stream just freeze for anyone else?
[0:14:05] <+Pookiedaexzile> Uh sure should go on the box
[0:14:05] <HelghastTroop> i woudve thought plaugue wasnt rreal in to the fps edge lord games
[0:14:42] <%DaKnightWarrior> Shoot demons until they start flashing, glory kill, repeat.
[0:14:42] <TheAsylumCat> @helghasttroop he does play Destiny so he's full of surprises
[0:14:43] <Them00n> You should just play animal crossing or something
[0:14:48] <otakon17> Plague, maybe something more relaxing like Animal Crossing?
[0:14:53] <%DaKnightWarrior> still a fun game though
[0:14:58] <otakon17> You got Blood Punch tho
[0:15:05] <StrawberryLion> Put it straight to baby mode.
[0:15:10] <+Pookiedaexzile> Nah you're right, They didn't color code everything for clean reads
[0:15:13] <HelghastTroop> he could play more baba is you Kappa
[0:15:25] <otakon17> Activate PLOW MODE
[0:15:43] <$Rezca> ABC. Alaways Be Chainsawing
[0:15:56] <+Pookiedaexzile> The game wants Plague to play it
[0:16:05] <otakon17> This is how I feel about Bloodborne
[0:16:07] <+Pookiedaexzile> How dare they
[0:16:12] <otakon17> it wants you to play as a Speedy McNinja
[0:16:23] <otakon17> I cannot parry worth a damn
[0:16:26] <+Pookiedaexzile> Oh wait
[0:16:29] <+Pookiedaexzile> IS HE REALLY
[0:16:33] <cap_bon> Game: Prove how much of a hardcore gamer you are. Plauge: No.
[0:16:35] <+Pookiedaexzile> HE dun did it
[0:16:42] <Them00n> Have you found the infinite ammo cheat?
[0:16:50] <heytakeiteasyterry> how are you enjoying doom eternal plague
[0:17:05] <otakon17> like maybe it'll just CLICK with you later
[0:17:08] <Skeletonmanners> yea the combat in this is definitely wierder than 2016
[0:17:14] <Sundaysmiles01> You could always play Quake II
[0:17:22] <otakon17> I felt the same way with a completely different game till I went back to it later, Shadow Hearts
[0:17:39] <%DaKnightWarrior> Yeah, the movement feels great.
[0:17:50] <otakon17> Shadow Hearts is a JRPG with a QTE based combat system that can completely screw you over if your timing is shit
[0:17:50] <TheAsylumCat> 2016 balanced challenge and leisure this is straight challenge
[0:17:53] <zepie__> Don't be pussy plauge
[0:17:53] <Shardlab> Some enemies got extra spongey
[0:18:12] <Shardlab> And then they added "weak spots"
[0:18:20] <+Pookiedaexzile> Nah nah, This is the best
[0:18:22] <$Rezca> after a cerrtain amount of deaths, you get the armor boost
[0:18:37] <otakon17> RAGE II might be more your speed there Plague
[0:18:38] <Skeletonmanners> you just wanna kill a man but then theres effort involved and you change your mind
[0:18:38] <Lman90245> Well I mean it's hellspawns not people
[0:18:48] <otakon17> you have abilities but they're less "required"
[0:18:52] <TheAsylumCat> serial killers aren't concerned with having a big dick
[0:18:56] <+Pookiedaexzile> I don't wanna play the game, I want to watch someone play the game
[0:19:01] <otakon17> Chainsaw is full
[0:19:01] <StrawberryLion> Gotta chainsaw those trash mobs
[0:19:03] <TheAsylumCat> the murder is the sex
[0:19:03] <+Pookiedaexzile> but I also want that same feeling
[0:19:04] <aubrea> using the chainsaw drops your ammo
[0:19:13] <jellycouch> movement seems like it is chunky compared to 2016
[0:19:21] <Shardlab> They didn't want ya to just be a bullet hose
[0:19:27] <otakon17> they really should make the cooldowns more "apparent" like maybe you hear a Chainsaw rev when your Chainsaw is fully charged
[0:19:35] <+Pookiedaexzile> @jellycouch Nah thats just him
[0:19:36] <Exadata_> I'm surprised at the amount of people that are saying how much they like this game considering how much I hear people complain about the game while playing
[0:19:51] <Skeletonmanners> its an exhausting game exa
[0:19:57] <otakon17> it's a rhythm thing I wager
[0:20:01] <Skeletonmanners> even if you like it theres gonna be some groaning involved
[0:20:03] <otakon17> Plague just hasn't found his yet
[0:20:18] <TheAsylumCat> @exadata_ mind you I shit talk games I like but am frustrated with
[0:20:21] <Shardlab> A lotta folks got used to 2016, which does let you lean on certain weapons and hosing guts with bullets
[0:20:30] <+Pookiedaexzile> If only you could get ammo at any time, by killing things
[0:20:37] <otakon17> The lower ammo capacity does not help
[0:20:38] <TheAsylumCat> it's a stress thing
[0:20:52] <otakon17> DAMN
[0:20:54] <cap_bon> if rockets worked you wouldnt have to ration your shotgun ammo for grenadeing floaty guys
[0:20:56] <sniffy77> there's definitely a rhythm you need to get down
[0:20:58] <otakon17> THAT was a cool Glory Kill
[0:21:08] <otakon17> break arm, shove elbow through skull
[0:21:20] <otakon17> suddenly armored PInkie
[0:21:22] <Exadata_> everyone complains, no game is perfect, but I hear a LOT of complaining with this game
[0:21:31] <Skeletonmanners> yea you had to go out of your way for secrets in 2016 and it took unneccesarily long to find alot of them
[0:21:31] <$Rezca> weird, I feel the opposite, I hated finding secrets in this game
[0:21:35] <Skeletonmanners> in this they're mostly in the way
[0:21:40] <otakon17> Through the eyes!
[0:21:44] <Skeletonmanners> but alot are tied to platforming or optional challenges instead
[0:21:48] <Shardlab> You're shooting a pinkie in the face
[0:21:54] <otakon17> Test your mettle?
[0:21:56] <Shardlab> They like that tickle
[0:22:01] <+mrkisi> @plagueofgripes I love your videos, say same and remember to wash your hands, have a great day
[0:22:01] <otakon17> I mean Plague, you played Dark Souls
[0:22:05] <+twohitgood> not a lot o health, you need to shoot them in the back. face is heavily armored.
[0:22:07] <Exadata_> masochists
[0:22:11] <Lman90245> I 'm a filthy casual
[0:22:12] <+Pookiedaexzile> Has Played Darksouls multiple times
[0:22:31] <Skeletonmanners> i like figuring out games
[0:22:40] <C24U> Ammo is restrictive in order you to use other abilities in conjunction
[0:22:44] <Futurecity10> @PlagueOfGripes if you dont care about slayer gates, you can enable the infinite ammo cheat code. It doesnt hinder any progress
[0:22:46] <Skeletonmanners> like in rpgs i feel if its too easy you dont have to try but harder ones you have to plan and i enjoy that
[0:22:47] <SleepyMaribo> there is
[0:22:59] <BillieNoMates> There is
[0:23:02] <+WaywardSera> It's in the...first level I think?
[0:23:03] <Futurecity10> @PlagueOfGripes You should already have the infinite ammo cheat
[0:23:10] <TheAsylumCat> there is an old video on the Exra Credits channel talking about different types of games and how they fulfill different needs
[0:23:10] <Valegator> infinite ammo cheat code is secret below super gore nest
[0:23:16] <BillieNoMates> It's the first one I think?
[0:23:16] <cap_bon> is there a cheat code that makes the loop more like 2016
[0:23:23] <sniffy77> from my experience, the basic shotgun and the basic assault rifle is only for weakening the weak guys to do glory kills and the actual use for them for the bigs guys are the weapon mods
[0:23:31] <otakon17> Apparently no
[0:23:33] <Skeletonmanners> like i enjoy hard games but not to be challenged, i just find figuring out how to play interesting
[0:23:41] <Skeletonmanners> learning what to do and when
[0:23:43] <otakon17> man the maps are still super huge
[0:23:48] <sniffy77> i think it said that you can still progress with cheats
[0:23:50] <Skeletonmanners> i dont care about any e peen, i just consider games like puzzles to solve
[0:23:52] <otakon17> Settings?
[0:24:00] <CyberDingus> Plague, you missed a secret
[0:24:24] <TheAsylumCat> @skeletonmanners games that keep your attention without being dick breaking
[0:24:27] <BillieNoMates> Cant make it interesting either
[0:24:31] <Exadata_> new doom lore DansGame
[0:24:58] <Skeletonmanners> like, i like hard games but almost despite them being hard instead of because they're hard if that makes sense
[0:25:38] <$daveronald> to flex on humans
[0:25:42] <Shardlab> The suffering
[0:25:47] <TheAsylumCat> because demons are evil
[0:25:50] <ehStuGatz> to spite the doom guy
[0:25:54] <CyberDingus> ALEX JONES WAS RIGHT
[0:25:54] <Exadata_> maybe they are salty doomguy keeps killing them
[0:25:58] <@Nightbot> Plague is a youtube animator and also streams at https://picarto.tv/Plague . Also: t-shirts! http://goo.gl/lze8QO
[0:26:03] <sniffy77> it does
[0:26:10] <Exadata_> brush its teeth
[0:26:24] <+WaywardSera> you gotta tickle the ganglia
[0:26:24] <$Rezca> Too early for that 1Up
[0:26:35] <sniffy77> if there is no easy straightforward way to get something, chances are you need to progress later in the level
[0:26:52] <YakumoYomi> @CyberDingus What?! Are they turning the frickin' frogs gay?!
[0:27:01] <cardboardboots> i love the thinking but the solution is much dumber
[0:27:06] <Skeletonmanners> flexing your asscheeks makes you jump higher
[0:27:12] <CyberDingus> @YakumoYomi WHAT DO YOU THINK ARE THE IMPS?!
[0:27:15] <ehStuGatz> chemicals are turning the frogs into gay demons
[0:27:32] <YakumoYomi> OH GOD!
[0:28:02] <CyberDingus> pLAGUE You did IT
[0:28:17] <%caramello_man> Why are those cars just floating?
[0:28:21] <BillieNoMates> I just severely dislike the platforming
[0:28:27] <jellycouch> he needs time-stop to get the 1-man
[0:28:31] <Exadata_> devil magic
[0:28:34] <$Rezca> Flesh Pillars exert their own gravity
[0:28:36] <ehStuGatz> how come night bot shills everything but your discord
[0:28:44] <deviljhojho_> Lookin cool
[0:29:15] <ehStuGatz> did they ever explain why UAC are comical super villains
[0:29:18] <Dingo_Eejit> gone
[0:29:23] <BillieNoMates> Yeah gone
[0:29:24] <+Punishedkaiger> The gauss canon was too op
[0:29:24] <+edited156> Sort of?
[0:29:25] <Futurecity10> Thats basically destroyer blade
[0:29:26] <Dingo_Eejit> but not forgotten
[0:29:26] <BillieNoMates> Ballista replaced it
[0:29:29] <Skeletonmanners> yea ballista replaced it
[0:29:31] <CyberDingus> for PvP only?
[0:29:40] <sniffy77> arbalest is good
[0:29:41] <BillieNoMates> All the Doom 2016 guns bar the plasma were OP
[0:29:46] <Mexrage> i actually liked the siege mode mod for the gauss rifle on 2016, it hits so hard and on area
[0:29:55] <+Gutsandlove> the destroy blade is pretty good
[0:29:57] <Dingo_Eejit> *shrug*
[0:29:57] <+edited156> The other upgrade takes out everything.
[0:30:05] <+edited156> Not just baby enemies.
[0:30:06] <+Gutsandlove> but slow
[0:30:08] <Exadata_> Does this game mention God? A lot of game mention demons and hell but they don't mention heaven
[0:30:22] <Skeletonmanners> its great
[0:30:27] <+Gutsandlove> it does, at least heaven
[0:30:31] <Skeletonmanners> slap
[0:30:34] <jellycouch> the angels are there and they're like "rad"
[0:30:36] <CyberDingus> @PlagueOfGripes I mean Doom has PvP right? Maybe the old guns are reserved for that game mod?
[0:30:38] <Dingo_Eejit> they're jus warming up Plague : )
[0:30:38] <YakumoYomi> Fight fucking, or fuck fighting?
[0:30:50] <Fenlig> Anger has a variable framerate
[0:30:54] <Dingo_Eejit> gettin loose
[0:31:30] <Skeletonmanners> jelloman is here to challenge you with jellos
[0:31:38] <jellycouch> why does doomman have wave dash
[0:31:44] <Dingo_Eejit> GET READY FOR THE NEXT CHALLENGE-CHALLENGE-challenge
[0:31:48] <cap_bon> nooo my jello why would you cut it open
[0:31:51] <Skeletonmanners> to get ready for Smash
[0:32:00] <YakumoYomi> Please don't shame the mortally challenged, Plague.
[0:32:01] <CyberDingus> @PlagueOfGripes Stop being MEAN to the mortally challenged you BIGOT
[0:32:33] <ehStuGatz> I just realized, why do the arachnotrons have brainbones
[0:32:46] <+WaywardSera> oh that's a big fuckmachine right there
[0:33:12] <sniffy77> night sentinels?
[0:33:24] <+WaywardSera> it reads like 40k fanfiction
[0:33:28] <BillieNoMates> They added pointless lore to a game that was Kill everything
[0:33:36] <$doomp12> mortality challenged joke is overused, it's a shame later on
[0:33:39] <cap_bon> so is Hell hell? or space aliens?
[0:33:51] <Commissar_Cornflakes> Space demons
[0:34:09] <BillieNoMates> They just made more focus on the chainsaw
[0:34:16] <BillieNoMates> and made more enemies to shoot
[0:34:21] <Dingo_Eejit> But you gotta use the chainsaw Plague - "It's COOOOL"
[0:34:24] <Run44forrest> hggGun psaSmug
[0:34:28] <jellycouch> ammo is sparse because Doom is survival horror now
[0:34:32] <+fingalights> I always thought it was like Hellraiser thing, Interdemintional demon aliens
[0:34:34] <Skeletonmanners> yea ammo in 2016 was more like a normal fps
[0:34:39] <ehStuGatz> I like doom lore because it tries to make sense of rule of cool chaos
[0:34:40] <Skeletonmanners> but the chainsaw didnt refuel itself
[0:34:49] <Skeletonmanners> they really want you to chainsaw shit in this
[0:34:50] <Commissar_Cornflakes> I want to shoot the gun not look for ammo
[0:34:55] <otakon17> Good luck there Plague, take care folks
[0:35:04] <Mexrage> the original doom were also very scarce on ammo, like...what you use on levels was more based on the ammo that spawned on the level, than your choice
[0:35:11] <Dingo_Eejit> those scoundrels
[0:35:11] <BillieNoMates> Gauss and chaingun
[0:35:12] <Commissar_Cornflakes> the gauss cannon
[0:35:17] <Skeletonmanners> prolly super shotgun and gauss
[0:35:19] <Commissar_Cornflakes> and the super shotgun
[0:35:19] <BillieNoMates> Super shotgun
[0:35:28] <Commissar_Cornflakes> and chaingun's super dakka mode
[0:35:29] <cap_bon> How dare players use guns they enjoy
[0:35:38] <$Rezca> chaingun was best waifu
[0:35:43] <Valegator> get ready to get mad
[0:35:45] <Commissar_Cornflakes> Well plasma got used in pro strats too
[0:35:49] <Commissar_Cornflakes> but mostly just for the stun
[0:35:49] <Jinrya_the_Red_Wizard> who do you think is more angry, doomguy or kratos?
[0:36:09] <+WaywardSera> kratos isn't angry, he's just petty
[0:36:18] <Commissar_Cornflakes> Kratos has worse anger management
[0:36:22] <Commissar_Cornflakes> Doom Guy is angrier overall
[0:36:26] <Skeletonmanners> in re 4 once you get a Red 9 you can pretty much just use it forever
[0:36:28] <jellycouch> swolem
[0:36:34] <Skeletonmanners> or SMG
[0:36:46] <dzmi13> I read that as bliff totem :P
[0:37:12] <Fenlig> Didn't that game only have a red9 and that sniper rifle?
[0:37:12] <Sundaysmiles01> Excited for RE3 Plague?
[0:37:15] <cap_bon> tmp run Kappa
[0:37:21] <+WaywardSera> I do like the idea of a totem that just asks you if you lift
[0:37:59] <Skeletonmanners> i always save up too much Magnum ammo in re 4
[0:38:02] <Dingo_Eejit> "Those stinking degenerates! Using the weapons they LIKE using in the game they've paid good money to play" - "How dare they"
[0:38:05] <Skeletonmanners> have like 50 and bosses die in 5 shots
[0:38:08] <+firmlygraspi1> MINE THROWER RUN Pog
[0:38:20] <YakumoYomi> That sounds like Breath of the Wild, and the reasons I've seen come up in speculation with regard to the fragility of weapons.
[0:38:33] <+firmlygraspi1> TMP is excellent, Pat is insane
[0:38:35] <BillieNoMates> Buff totem
[0:38:40] <Sundaysmiles01> Because the buff totem you were told about
[0:38:41] <BillieNoMates> They just explained it
[0:38:44] <$Rezca> Lift Totem
[0:38:51] <+twohitgood> you just read about the totum
[0:38:51] <Skeletonmanners> no its the Totem
[0:38:52] <+Manjove> the Buff Totem
[0:38:56] <jellycouch> Lift Totem lmao
[0:39:10] <CyberDingus> >All those demons >Not a single Big Buffed Demon Chick Sad.
[0:39:37] <+firmlygraspi1> some of the demons are chicks, they're just not sexualized
[0:39:38] <Commissar_Cornflakes> The snake chicks are...chicks.
[0:39:56] <Dingo_Eejit> Do a Blood Punch™
[0:39:59] <Sundaysmiles01> I mean, you 'could' do a self challenge run to only use two weapons if you wanted
[0:40:07] <$Rezca> Oh god
[0:40:19] <cap_bon> I loved having to using shitty broken sticks and clubs all the time in breath of the wild it really increased my "enjoyment" of the game
[0:40:35] <Skeletonmanners> does this game have ammo pickups other than chainsawing enemies?
[0:40:39] <Commissar_Cornflakes> Doom 2016 was fine.
[0:40:40] <Skeletonmanners> cuz 2016 had just random ammo
[0:40:42] <Commissar_Cornflakes> Just give me ammo.
[0:40:53] <Commissar_Cornflakes> I want to shoot the guns, not juggle ammo pools.
[0:40:54] <+WaywardSera> He wants to show you his favorite anime
[0:40:56] <+chaumiester> I think that's called Fear
[0:41:06] <sonofthedeepsouth> Demon attackin at extremily hihg sped!
[0:41:11] <sonofthedeepsouth> No get Hype
[0:41:16] <trianglehat> stop making me have fun
[0:41:17] <CyberDingus> Mortally Challenged y'all

[0:41:22] <jellycouch> hype thou
[0:41:29] <YakumoYomi> My favorite color
[0:41:32] <Commissar_Cornflakes> Surprised they kept that.
[0:41:36] <whirly25> more like the color semen ayo
[0:41:40] <Commissar_Cornflakes> The usual suspects had a shit-fit over that joke
[0:41:44] <sonofthedeepsouth> I like that they kept that
[0:41:46] <$Rezca> Cute in what way?
[0:41:54] <Dingo_Eejit> mwah
[0:41:56] <+Taglog7> WutFace faputa
[0:42:07] <sonofthedeepsouth> Faputa is doing nothing wrong
[0:42:10] <sonofthedeepsouth> spoiler
[0:42:16] <sonofthedeepsouth> LUL MELTING POT
[0:42:18] <+Taglog7> LUL BibleThump
[0:42:36] <sonofthedeepsouth> ID really making me think
[0:42:40] <sonofthedeepsouth> guises
[0:42:43] <crusader_heide> You think theres too much lore and menus??
[0:42:45] <sonofthedeepsouth> really making me think
[0:42:49] <ralphwiggum16> Plague, I just want more violence.
[0:42:57] <ralphwiggum16> Why aren't you giving me more violence?
[0:43:31] <%JailShmixRemix> plagueChirei
[0:43:45] <ralphwiggum16> COOL!!!!
[0:43:50] <YakumoYomi> Pat seems to be doing alright on controller
[0:43:51] <Skeletonmanners> hear its not too bad on a controller
[0:43:53] <+chaumiester> Certain things are easier
[0:43:58] <+chaumiester> Like grenade switching
[0:44:02] <Skeletonmanners> they did alot of correction stuff for it
[0:44:05] <sonofthedeepsouth> We all agree that the /aco/ DOOM threads are a bara infested hellhole
[0:44:08] <$daveronald> I want a mod that replaces all monsters with Pokemon
[0:44:13] <ralphwiggum16> This is basically the height of all art.
[0:44:23] <$Rezca> yeah... its not as cute as Siege-chan
[0:44:30] <cap_bon> so you can have 150 plasma gun shots or 7 railgun shots
[0:44:54] <sonofthedeepsouth> use the shitty one
[0:44:56] <Skeletonmanners> in fairness this one aint upgraded yet
[0:45:00] <+chaumiester> Did you also notice they took away... like alot of ammo for your guns
[0:45:04] <Skeletonmanners> default gauss wasnt that amazing
[0:45:20] <Commissar_Cornflakes> Is anyone even reading Marvel comics any more?
[0:45:22] <CyberDingus> SAFE SPACE
[0:45:22] <Sundaysmiles01> safe space
[0:45:22] <YakumoYomi> Snowflake and Safespace
[0:45:22] <burningjalapeno> safespace
[0:45:22] <Skeletonmanners> SNOWFLAKE AND SAFESPACE
[0:45:24] <+Taglog7> So DC
[0:45:24] <$daveronald> safe space
[0:45:28] <sniffy77> screentime
[0:45:33] <ralphwiggum16> Plague, we need more violence.
[0:45:34] <redrix_3> meme obsessed teen*
[0:45:39] <$Rezca> The internet has ruined me with the word Snowflake
[0:45:40] <Commissar_Cornflakes> I mean so many books get cancelled I don't think anyone's reading 'em.
[0:45:46] <crusader_heide> like aquaman?
[0:45:49] <cap_bon> who are those characters suppsoed to appeal to
[0:45:54] <CyberDingus> 4 DAMAGE
[0:45:56] <CyberDingus> RIP EM
[0:46:06] <+Taglog7> And people call the cyclops in Upward pandering\
[0:46:11] <@Nightbot> Plague is a youtube animator and also streams at https://picarto.tv/Plague . Also: t-shirts! http://goo.gl/lze8QO
[0:46:30] <$daveronald> its like Nathan Explosion created this game
[0:46:45] <sonofthedeepsouth> The snake demons are supposed to be females aren't they?
[0:46:51] <Commissar_Cornflakes> yup
[0:46:52] <+Taglog7> Don't nerf rashid
[0:46:54] <Commissar_Cornflakes> them and the summoners
[0:47:05] <Commissar_Cornflakes> and of course the spider mastermind
[0:47:09] <Jinrya_the_Red_Wizard> Anyone here anything new about Elden Ring yet?
[0:47:10] <Commissar_Cornflakes> And the arachnotrons
[0:47:12] <sonofthedeepsouth> NEW GUN BAD! Old gun Good
[0:47:15] <sonofthedeepsouth> thats you
[0:47:35] <Commissar_Cornflakes> That's the thing though, Doom 2016's guns didn't even have 'bad' ones, except the pistol.
[0:47:35] <Valegator> secret below super gore nest gives you infinite ammo cheat
[0:47:35] <Sundaysmiles01> yeah
[0:47:37] <Skeletonmanners> they look like something from Quake 3
[0:47:43] <Skeletonmanners> strogg looking ass
[0:47:52] <Sundaysmiles01> I miss Quake...
[0:47:55] <+twohitgood> whenever i see someone walking in the lava in this game, i'm reminded of the movie clue and miss white.
[0:48:01] <skelfae> shoot em wirh the plasma rifle tto blow up shields
[0:48:02] <crusader_heide> I easily fit inside a locker*
[0:48:03] <+Taglog7> they look like pat Kappa
[0:48:07] <ralphwiggum16> Plague, i feel like you don't appreciate how awesome it is when you're killing these horrible demons, it's ruining my immersion.
[0:48:11] <sonofthedeepsouth> Save the genepool
[0:48:17] <CyberDingus> @sonofthedeepsouth those snake chicks need wider hips and bigger snek titties
[0:48:18] <+Xalgar> Nope LUL
[0:48:21] <+fingalights> Very killable face
[0:48:27] <+psydaku> it doesn't
[0:48:30] <+chaumiester> I would like more ammo for all the guns... at least 1.5 times more. Having the max of 20ish shots for the super shotgun is... limiting
[0:48:33] <Sundaysmiles01> Revenge of the Tumblr Team Taskforce
[0:48:37] <crusader_heide> Whats the 80's?
[0:48:37] <BillieNoMates> thats sorta the point tho?
[0:48:38] <cap_bon> It does not.
[0:48:39] <skelfae> its really sexist
[0:48:41] <Commissar_Cornflakes> It's dumb.
[0:48:44] <Commissar_Cornflakes> Let me shoot the gun.
[0:48:46] <sonofthedeepsouth> @CyberDingus Someone is already working on that I bet
[0:48:59] <CyberDingus> @sonofthedeepsouth we can only hope brother
[0:49:11] <+Xalgar> Who is woke media even made for? The 3000 people that upvoted something on Tumblr?
[0:49:17] <+firmlygraspi1> I've only seen the second one
[0:49:19] <BillieNoMates> yep
[0:49:19] <+firmlygraspi1> it was idiotic
[0:49:23] <+chaumiester> The game really wants you to use the... other abilities. Which is annoying
[0:49:30] <BillieNoMates> Go woke, go broke.
[0:49:30] <+chaumiester> Uh... you're not even at the halfway point
[0:49:37] <sonofthedeepsouth> @Xalgar It's made for themselves so that they can pet themselves on the back
[0:49:39] <cap_bon> the ruined mechs look cool at least its got that
[0:49:40] <burningjalapeno> What difficulty are you on plague?
[0:49:42] <CyberDingus> She'd know about pushing hard. GIggity.
[0:49:42] <sonofthedeepsouth> PUSH IT HARD
[0:49:42] <+MalekDracarus> youve got a lot more game left
[0:49:47] <+xenoriddley36> Keep washing your hands Plague
[0:49:49] <Sundaysmiles01> Tssss. Ah. Push it!
[0:49:49] <+Atomic_ColliderSG> sounds like he is really not enjoying his time with the game
[0:49:50] <Dingo_Eejit> "But it's gonna outshine the BFG tho"- THEN MAKE THE DANG BFG COOLER, like let me use it more times than barely any at all perhaps? Hook it up to the ammo pool for the Gauss or Plasma cannons *like it used to be*
[0:49:52] <crusader_heide> Yeahhhh push it!
[0:50:00] <Skeletonmanners> 13 levels plague, this one is the 5th
[0:50:02] <$doomp12> your about 37 percent through
[0:50:03] <+Xalgar> @sonofthedeepsouth But as a business, it makes no sense LUL
[0:50:03] <Skeletonmanners> its a long game
[0:50:08] <+fingalights> Push it reaaal good
[0:50:12] <$Rezca> I like to imagine that as a virtual Miku giving demon propaganda
[0:50:16] <ralphwiggum16> COOL!!!
[0:50:20] <princessschaos> follow @itsmejd
[0:50:26] <burningjalapeno> Nic did something likes 20+ on UV
[0:50:36] <YakumoYomi> 61 shots
[0:50:38] <cap_bon> why are basic bitch enemies taking two shotgun shells on easy mode
[0:50:44] <crusader_heide> the money kill
[0:50:48] <CyberDingus> @Rezca demons couldn't even turn the 2D semen demons into 3D semon demons. Pussies.
[0:51:02] <sonofthedeepsouth> @Xalgar Those people unironically belive in the marxist theory of economics don't expect basic market logic from them
[0:51:10] <crusader_heide> o
[0:51:12] <Sundaysmiles01> You could always play Doom 2016
[0:51:19] <Dingo_Eejit> BUT now it GloWs REd though! _ ThatS COoL!
[0:51:31] <ralphwiggum16> Can you say "blood punch" again?
[0:51:37] <Sundaysmiles01> I mean, no game is really perfect
[0:51:41] <Sundaysmiles01> its purely subjective
[0:52:03] <+RealPT1> i like the tone of 2016 more
[0:52:07] <Futurecity10> as someone who beat eternal, 2016 is better
[0:52:12] <+Nomenanza> universal thing I noticed about D Eternal is that people find it hard to get used to low ammo count and increased speed and aggressiveness of enemies.
[0:52:28] <BillieNoMates> The difference between easiest and hardest is basically letting the AI act
[0:52:38] <redrix_3> i thought you'd be more of an animal crossing fan since you have a farming background
[0:52:39] <Skeletonmanners> yea first 3 difficulties are mostly number differences, but nightmare they behave differently
[0:52:52] <BillieNoMates> On Ultra Violence, the AI not on screen will still attack instead of dance around
[0:52:59] <+Xalgar> This game definitely feels so much better with KB/M
[0:53:06] <ralphwiggum16> COOL
[0:53:13] <sonofthedeepsouth> Vidya Gaem
[0:53:15] <ralphwiggum16> SUPER GORE NEXT
[0:53:23] <$Rezca> They Jumped The Shark
[0:53:31] <sonofthedeepsouth> In eternal I think we can say hell got cocky
[0:53:48] <+eanscrale> The memes are canon now
[0:53:52] <Dingo_Eejit> a bit naff?
[0:53:56] <+RealPT1> the writing in eternal feels to much like a 00s shooter where everyone is practically worshipping you in the game
[0:54:04] <cap_bon> Not feeling very powerful in this game.
[0:54:28] <+Xalgar> The Heavy Metal element is Mick Gordan
[0:54:31] <Skeletonmanners> yea they've gone bit too far
[0:54:36] <+fingalights> Too goofy, to hard. Too Hard Goofy
[0:54:38] <+firmlygraspi1> its like Saints Row 3
[0:54:40] <+Xalgar> he carries everything LUL
[0:54:40] <ehStuGatz> to be fair everyone should be worshiping you in game because you are the only thing with demon success rate
[0:54:56] <sonofthedeepsouth> BATTLE MECHS
[0:55:05] <Sundaysmiles01> I mean... Originally you were a human marine who got his pet rabbit killed by Demons so you John Wicked their asses into bloody goop
[0:55:06] <ehStuGatz> why did uac continue to go full retard after you kill the board of directors
[0:55:07] <$SGrim> Only one point of contention. There's always been a subset of heavy metal mired in fantasy tropes. This game seems to be leaning super hard into that.
[0:55:12] <sonofthedeepsouth> Demons>NATO got it
[0:55:27] <BillieNoMates> Earth sure sucks
[0:55:28] <+Punishedkaiger> @PlagueOfGripes The UAC called in the steiner scout squad to fight the hell demons
[0:55:36] <cap_bon> The EDF guys really gave it their best
[0:55:43] <BillieNoMates> 32 miles is outside artillery range?
[0:55:48] <sonofthedeepsouth> At this point why not use nukes
[0:56:02] <sonofthedeepsouth> These fucking are taking over countries use fucking nukes
[0:56:13] <ahaegotrigger> that is really funny
[0:56:19] <ahaegotrigger> theyre humping the ship
[0:56:43] <+WaywardSera> rearward infiltration unh Kreygasm
[0:56:43] <sonofthedeepsouth> Goddamn still using Apaches
[0:56:58] <+Xalgar> I want to play a DOOM game that takes place during Hell's invasion of Earth
[0:57:17] <+Xalgar> Apaches fighting Demons sounds awesome
[0:57:28] <Make_me_mad> Much like the part of Castlevania Lore where the military fought Dracula, I really want to see this part of the Doom story.
[0:57:32] <Make_me_mad> Instead of the aftermath.
[0:57:36] <sonofthedeepsouth> Wasn't the dlc supposed to be that
[0:57:40] <CyberDingus> Plague, have you learnt nothing from JJBA? Naked Men are POWERFUL
[0:57:56] <Sundaysmiles01> NUDITY BRINGS POWER HAVE YOU LEARNED NOTHING
[0:58:24] <+Nomenanza> in my experience demons die too quick or not quick enough
[0:58:32] <cap_bon> the perk that let you wesker dash across the room and glory kill themw as awesome
[0:58:57] <ehStuGatz> the new doom games are more like Duke nukem than classic doom
[0:59:07] <+Nomenanza> I still like Doom 3
[0:59:07] <Sundaysmiles01> its weird, because they said that the demons have skin as tough as steel and an internal temperature to melt the same, and yet Doomguy is strong enough to rip them apart by hand
[0:59:11] <+Nomenanza> it was alright
[0:59:15] <BillieNoMates> Well DooM 3 was the original concept according to Carmack
[0:59:22] <+fingalights> Quake Doom, Dake QUoom
[0:59:23] <BillieNoMates> They just lacked the tech
[0:59:36] <BillieNoMates> you have a rad suit Plague
[0:59:38] <%caramello_man> Hey look! It's a mario
[0:59:42] <$Rezca> time for VideoGames
[0:59:48] <sonofthedeepsouth> video game
[0:59:53] <Jinrya_the_Red_Wizard> hahaha mario ass level
[0:59:59] <Sundaysmiles01> Doom3 was more gritty
[1:00:00] <cap_bon> wtf is this bowser shit
[1:00:07] <+Nomenanza> I kind of love how unapologetically saturday morning cartoon-ish this game is
[1:00:07] <+Queenemereldas> plague use the alt fire on plasma rifle
[1:00:09] <Commissar_Cornflakes> Doom 3's gunplay fucking sucked
[1:00:13] <sonofthedeepsouth> Doom 3 should had been another franchise
[1:00:14] <cap_bon> when did the demons have the time to set this up
[1:00:15] <Commissar_Cornflakes> and its weapon sound font was garbage
[1:00:21] <Commissar_Cornflakes> and its shotgun in particular was shit
[1:00:26] <+Nomenanza> @Commissar_Cornflakes yeah not a lot of weapons had impact
[1:00:28] <Commissar_Cornflakes> how do you fuck up a shotgun in DOOM?
[1:00:30] <sonofthedeepsouth> Doom 3 should had been dead space before dead space
[1:00:33] <+Nomenanza> rifle felt really flaccid
[1:00:52] <+AMadHollow> henlo Eli, how's the fence life going?
[1:01:08] <Sundaysmiles01> That would have been neat DeepSouth, maybe survival horror of a regular human trapped in some event horizon shit
[1:01:37] <$Rezca> Dashing also works to break through
[1:01:37] <+Manjove> dashing breaks walls
[1:01:38] <Jinrya_the_Red_Wizard> I forget, did plague say he hated fighting games?
[1:01:43] <sniffy77> you could dash
[1:01:49] <+Nomenanza> btw game doesnt explain it to you yet but you can just dash through breakables
[1:01:54] <+Engwithan_Elder_God> Optimist
[1:01:56] <BillieNoMates> The UAC butterface tumblr poster
[1:01:56] <Sundaysmiles01> I think she's an AI
[1:02:00] <sonofthedeepsouth> I think she probrably already is
[1:02:09] <sonofthedeepsouth> SUCK THAT RED DICK
[1:02:10] <ahaegotrigger> True
[1:02:13] <CyberDingus> @PlagueOfGripes she is into that Plague.
[1:02:22] <YakumoYomi> There's some rule34 of that, I'm sure.
[1:02:22] <+mrkisi> @plagueofgripes are you enjoying the game?
[1:02:28] <Commissar_Cornflakes> it's a woolie hole
[1:02:47] <%JailShmixRemix> From what I learned from.... certain content, demon dick is great dekill2hu
[1:02:53] <Dingo_Eejit> Voice volume to 20% perhaps, maybe less?
[1:03:25] <Sundaysmiles01> The thing is, to make the game easier, you have to do the challenges to unlock more shit, so if you don't do the challenges, the late game gets even harder, which is a challenge in itself
[1:03:32] <Commissar_Cornflakes> You know what Doom needs? More platforming!
[1:03:38] <Sundaysmiles01> So I guess Plague is going in hardcore afterall
[1:03:51] <+Roundelay11> above that platform
[1:04:52] <sonofthedeepsouth> LUL
[1:04:58] <J_Yossarian> what difficulty is plague playing on?
[1:04:58] <$daveronald> your too good at killing
[1:05:03] <BillieNoMates> Don't die Pinkie chan
[1:05:08] <sonofthedeepsouth> Plague do the challenges Plague
[1:05:10] <BillieNoMates> We need to fist you vigorously
[1:05:13] <sonofthedeepsouth> Get the key Plague
[1:05:21] <+Roundelay11> you've still got a ways to go in this level
[1:05:25] <cap_bon> Autoshotgun looks really fun shame theres no ammo for it
[1:05:30] <BillieNoMates> Doom 1 had it
[1:05:32] <Skeletonmanners> it was in Doom 1
[1:05:32] <Sundaysmiles01> Doom 1 had it
[1:05:34] <Commissar_Cornflakes> hurtfloors are in 1
[1:05:36] <Sundaysmiles01> in the first level
[1:05:38] <Skeletonmanners> both had floors that hurt you
[1:05:40] <Skeletonmanners> and they do suck
[1:05:40] <Valegator> you can reload checkpoint to respawn pinky
[1:05:42] <+fingalights> I think I only played 2? I don't know
[1:05:49] <Commissar_Cornflakes> hurtfloors are way more annoying in 1 from what I remember
[1:06:29] <Sundaysmiles01> DAKKA
[1:06:34] <Dingo_Eejit> so cool...
[1:06:46] <cap_bon> oh cool another gun to have no ammo for LUL
[1:06:48] <Sundaysmiles01> You can upgrade it
[1:06:58] <Sundaysmiles01> yeah, it still does that
[1:07:01] <Commissar_Cornflakes> the transform was a mod
[1:07:03] <Commissar_Cornflakes> not the default
[1:07:11] <+Nomenanza> yeah you are thinking of a mod Eli
[1:07:32] <+Nomenanza> nah it does stuff as you upgrade it
[1:07:33] <Sundaysmiles01> You can 'Charging Star' enemies with the energy shield if you dash into them
[1:07:39] <+Roundelay11> about a 8.5
[1:07:42] <Commissar_Cornflakes> Mostly positive.
[1:07:45] <cap_bon> Doom guy doesnt hide behind shields SMOrc
[1:07:53] <Commissar_Cornflakes> The main gripes I hear are the lousy ammo economy
[1:08:01] <Commissar_Cornflakes> and the story/cinematics are a pain in the asw
[1:08:04] <Commissar_Cornflakes> ass
[1:08:06] <+fingalights> Hard working Safe sequel
[1:08:10] <+Roundelay11> I mean, it's not a BAD game
[1:08:16] <+Nomenanza> the universal response was people really struggling in the beginning because of changed mechanics and as they get used to it they start enjoying it more
[1:08:23] <Dingo_Eejit> Suffice to say you aren't supposed/allowed to not like it, I'll tell ya that much
[1:08:29] <+Nomenanza> that is what I noticed at least
[1:08:30] <+cinder_chan> they leaned more into it being a video game and made it "self-aware" in some ways, but made it seem low effort instead?
[1:08:35] <Commissar_Cornflakes> There's a sense with this game from what I'm seeing that it's a lot less focused.
[1:08:39] <GarrisonWaifu> @Nomenanza bitterAyy
[1:08:42] <Kraahka> It feels like some executive came in and said "add all of this flashy bs so we can make more money"
[1:08:44] <Skeletonmanners> you seem to be in a minority but alot of people prefer 2016
[1:08:49] <Skeletonmanners> its not that uncommon of an opinion
[1:08:49] <Jinrya_the_Red_Wizard> @PlagueOfGripes It's ok, atleast you got away from Lyse in FFXIV, right? lol
[1:08:53] <Commissar_Cornflakes> They got really excited and threw so much shit at the wall that some of it is rougher than it might be.
[1:08:56] <+Nomenanza> Like, they did get rid of useless mods that werent used as much. Like the auto spin on chaingun
[1:08:57] <Sundaysmiles01> I'm up for being tested in 'skill', but I appreciate story more in my own experiences
[1:08:58] <chowdah101> pulsating meat
[1:09:00] <+R4dishh> I dont mind it being more self aware as a videogame but I could do without the deep lore
[1:09:28] <+aspirationdeath> people seem split on whether or not its better. im in the camp that this kicks its ass.
[1:09:29] <Kraahka> I think the cutscenes that disrupt the gameplay and exploration are the biggest complaint I have
[1:09:36] <+Nomenanza> the whole demon flesh thing is more Zerg-y than before
[1:09:36] <+cinder_chan> the hell stuff is a lot more cartoony and a lot less metal album cover
[1:09:37] <%caramello_man> looks more alien than demonic
[1:09:55] <sniffy77> its fine for me
[1:09:57] <Sundaysmiles01> Pat's been doing well on the controller
[1:09:57] <+Nomenanza> it is actually pretty comfortable on controller
[1:10:00] <Korgororo> are there that many cutscenes?
[1:10:03] <Futurecity10> it was fine
[1:10:04] <+Roundelay11> those snake dues can fuck you up real quick
[1:10:19] <skelfae> it is
[1:10:21] <Commissar_Cornflakes> Technically they're chicks.
[1:10:22] <+cinder_chan> which they are, again, right? the lore in this game establishes demons as cross dimension
[1:10:24] <sniffy77> the entire gameplay loop clicked for me in the next level and i found myself enjoying it a hell of a lot more
[1:10:26] <Commissar_Cornflakes> Got a new job after Xcom 2.
[1:10:33] <%marlowe86> the scene from Quake 4 with the heart pump.
[1:10:43] <+R4dishh> it feels like the story for an entirely different game
[1:10:48] <CyberDingus> If it was an ANIME game those snake things would look very, very different
[1:10:50] <+R4dishh> that was stapled onto doom of all things
[1:10:52] <+KaijuUltimax> What do you mean? Don't you like the lore of how DoomGuy is now an immortal angel?
[1:10:53] <Sundaysmiles01> Eli, wait till you hear your first 'voice-logs' from survivors
[1:10:56] <+Nomenanza> yeah my problem with the story is that they just throw you in almost at mid point, the beginning really is weird in that regard
[1:11:05] <+Nomenanza> I have no idea how doomguy got the flying space castle
[1:11:06] <$Rezca> They kinda already do look hot to me though
[1:11:08] <+firmlygraspi1> the late capitalism writing is not very effective
[1:11:14] <+R4dishh> How did doomguy get the space ship?
[1:11:19] <+R4dishh> that was pretty confusing
[1:11:22] <Kraahka> Yeah, I feel like there's a bunch of unnecessary cutscenes that show a door opening or the recent one that showed the pulsating heart, we should just be able to look at it in first person
[1:11:23] <Sundaysmiles01> no idea
[1:11:37] <%darkbotle> hello peoples
[1:11:38] <CrimsonAle> im expecting the dlc to bridge the gap between the games
[1:11:41] <+Nomenanza> yeah, the 13 year time gap between 2016 and Eternal (in game) isnt covered as well as I thought it would
[1:11:48] <+Nomenanza> it focuses more on UAC and ARC
[1:11:51] <peachteagaming> the first thing i will ever say to plague: "can i touch you face!"
[1:11:56] <Commissar_Cornflakes> The UAC has never been anything but a pastiche.
[1:12:07] <Commissar_Cornflakes> In the OG Doom it's a pastiche of Weyland-Yutani
[1:12:09] <Sundaysmiles01> I think they're going with more storybased DLC this time around instead of just shitting out MP dlc like they did with the 2016 release
[1:12:21] <Commissar_Cornflakes> in Doom 2016, the 'company as a culture'
[1:12:33] <Dingo_Eejit> @Nomenanza - We sleep a bunch and ate a lot of of hotdogs
[1:12:35] <Commissar_Cornflakes> and in Doom 2020 the 'company co-opting woke idiocy to make money'
[1:12:36] <+R4dishh> heh std
[1:12:36] <sonofthedeepsouth> DRUMPF
[1:12:45] <ahaegotrigger> Yeah
[1:12:52] <$daveronald> FUCKING Hubris
[1:12:55] <Jinrya_the_Red_Wizard> Sorry what's a pastiche? is that similar to a nod or reference?
[1:12:55] <sonofthedeepsouth> Can we sink cali into the sea yet?
[1:12:57] <Commissar_Cornflakes> Like, that's fine. The UAC is SUPPOSED to be a pastiche.
[1:12:58] <+Nomenanza> Oh you mean, like Star Trek Picard with its "we finna tackle Trump"
[1:13:11] <ahaegotrigger> yes very much
[1:13:15] <Commissar_Cornflakes> It's imitative art.
[1:13:20] <+fingalights> STP Fox news
[1:13:31] <%darkbotle> nuance is for cowards anyways
[1:13:44] <bijushukaku> gloryHi everyone
[1:13:46] <sonofthedeepsouth> Big Gay Boy adventures
[1:13:52] <+firmlygraspi1> it isn't going to age well at all
[1:13:53] <sonofthedeepsouth> start writing people
[1:13:55] <CyberDingus> @PlagueOfGripes lack of hardships means they never have to grow up and get better at anything.
[1:13:56] <Commissar_Cornflakes> Speaking of Picard, it's really fun to watch Mike and Rich slowly go crazy.
[1:13:57] <$daveronald> Picard would make a good DOOM guy
[1:13:59] <stanleyscumbag> Doom5: Doom Politica
[1:14:02] <Sundaysmiles01> So deep in your own ass you can't see past the other cheek
[1:14:08] <$doomp12> remember kids, just because it's conscious doesn't mean it's good.
[1:14:19] <$iwishthiswasicq> I click on the stream and Plague is not moving and ranting about some random thing, just as it should be.
[1:14:26] <+fingalights> My side Deep and Smart, other side shallow and dumb
[1:14:45] <sonofthedeepsouth> I can almost smell their farts
[1:14:52] <Sundaysmiles01> welcome to shades of gray
[1:15:13] <Commissar_Cornflakes> I mean I don't think Doom 2020's UAC is any more comical than 2016's.
[1:15:24] <sonofthedeepsouth> I wouldn't say doom is late stage captalism, more like cults are bullshit
[1:15:26] <arkv01> doom is absolutely comedy at this point
[1:15:30] <arkv01> one man wrecking machine is hilarious
[1:15:33] <sonofthedeepsouth> shiny
[1:15:43] <Commissar_Cornflakes> Though the company as a cult was more amusing than the company faking being woke.
[1:15:50] <Sundaysmiles01> You can upgrade it further to improve your movement speed
[1:15:50] <$daveronald> no ray tracing?
[1:15:55] <peachteagaming> plastic barrels?
[1:16:01] <+KaijuUltimax> Eight barrel minigun >>>>>> triple barrel minigun
[1:16:06] <Dingo_Eejit> Like a ship made of gun - a Gunship?
[1:16:06] <Sundaysmiles01> Yeah, not sure where tho
[1:16:11] <+FRANKONTHEROCKS> cheats only work when replaying missions
[1:16:15] <Valegator> secret below super gore nest gives you infinite ammo cheat
[1:16:20] <+firmlygraspi1> the energy shield is probably necessary on harder difficulties
[1:16:25] <sonofthedeepsouth> no plague you only do cheats on the second playthrough
[1:16:26] <+Hiro01231> you passed it
[1:16:31] <sonofthedeepsouth> ONLY THE SECOND ONE
[1:16:42] <+Nomenanza> buffboi totem
[1:16:47] <+Nomenanza> basically mini archvile
[1:17:08] <Skeletonmanners> want to just post where it is? found a faq with locations of the cheats
[1:17:10] <Jinrya_the_Red_Wizard> Not a fan of first person shooters, is Doom always this fast/busy?
[1:17:24] <Futurecity10> @PlagueOfGripes Infinite ammo is in the large area where you place all three keys
[1:17:25] <arkv01> yeah, doom is fast
[1:17:27] <arkv01> and punchy
[1:17:28] <+firmlygraspi1> I like their freaky jaws
[1:17:38] <Commissar_Cornflakes> This one is. Doom 2016 is a bit less spastic.
[1:17:38] <sonofthedeepsouth> LMG DEMONS
[1:17:41] <$Rezca> Keeps his APM HIGH
[1:17:52] <+Nomenanza> well I struggled with ammo at first, then realised they give you at least 1 point of fuel that regenerates
[1:17:57] <+fingalights> I still need to play Doom 16
[1:18:04] <sonofthedeepsouth> The demons starts default dancing LUL
[1:18:05] <%JailShmixRemix> plagueFace division 2
[1:18:19] <Commissar_Cornflakes> The platforming is coming off to me as really flat.
[1:18:19] <+R4dishh> pretty fun game
[1:18:22] <+R4dishh> comfy too
[1:18:25] <$Rezca> oh yeah, did they ever fix Wildlands 2?
[1:18:30] <+Nomenanza> division 2? i think you did
[1:18:30] <%JailShmixRemix> I believe you did
[1:18:31] <+firmlygraspi1> he's like a gypsy boxer
[1:18:34] <Commissar_Cornflakes> Like they heard everyone praise the verticality of 2016
[1:18:36] <Korgororo> not familiar with doom but weren't the older games also fast paced? if so what do people feel is the difference?
[1:18:42] <Kraahka> MONKEY BARS
[1:18:43] <Commissar_Cornflakes> but didn't notice everyone found the forced platforming annoying
[1:18:47] <skelfae> you dud for a bit
[1:18:55] <Commissar_Cornflakes> Doom 1/2 were fast paced but in a different way
[1:18:55] <%JJCheeker> Hello
[1:19:05] <Commissar_Cornflakes> the enemies were much slower than you, for example
[1:19:15] <+aspirationdeath> yeah that is the thing about this game. if you are unwilling to meet it where it wants to be youre going to have a bad time.
[1:19:23] <Sundaysmiles01> at harder difficulties and later levels? Yes, the older classic Dooms were quite fast paced
[1:19:28] <+Nomenanza> it is the right way, you just missed the monkey bar
[1:19:29] <Commissar_Cornflakes> Whereas in this game the enemies seem to mostly be pegged to your admittedly very, very high mobility
[1:19:29] <Sundaysmiles01> almost like bullet hells
[1:19:30] <Kraahka> Look for monkey bars
[1:19:30] <peachteagaming> how do you feel about the look of plasma weapons in game?
[1:19:45] <+firmlygraspi1> I never saw you play it or talk about it before you mentioned it in your favorite games tweet
[1:19:52] <Korgororo> I see
[1:19:57] <Skeletonmanners> @PlagueOfGripes checked, you had one stream of Wildlands
[1:20:16] <BabyNaBackbrace> In Doom 2 my friends and I modded the sprites and put me into the game as the soldier; we did a great animation of me bleeding out from the throat.
[1:20:19] <peachteagaming> bone penis!
[1:20:20] <SixerMason> speed runners are going to tear their hair out coping with all the spastic variables
[1:20:37] <sonofthedeepsouth> Why is hell putting this plataforms? For what purpose you do this demon
[1:20:38] <Mexrage> you could outrun rockets on original doom
[1:20:41] <sonofthedeepsouth> VIDEYA GAEMS
[1:20:41] <BillieNoMates> bing bing wahoo
[1:20:50] <joanna9700> lmao
[1:20:54] <sonofthedeepsouth> SATAN LOVES JUMPS
[1:20:57] <joanna9700> Satan is Bowser
[1:20:59] <arkv01> satan has OCD
[1:21:01] <+fingalights> Satan is a Nintendo Fan
[1:21:01] <+Nomenanza> I cant wait till Doomguy finally gets that piece of shit Bowser
[1:21:04] <Commissar_Cornflakes> Maybe Satan is the only one who wanted more platforming in Doom
[1:21:05] <Sundaysmiles01> Satan really loves his swinging fire ball shit
[1:21:07] <peachteagaming> jesus loves sonic
[1:21:16] <Commissar_Cornflakes> it would make sense that the demons would like the reviled platforming
[1:21:26] <$Rezca> Mario Level time
[1:21:28] <Kraahka> I think all of these grabby walls are really janky, they break up the movement too much
[1:21:30] <YakumoYomi> Maybe this is what Mario actually sees, and the games just have a filter to make it look cartoony
[1:21:32] <joanna9700> Doom Platforming
[1:21:34] <+Nomenanza> If you think about it, Satan is just building levels in Mario Maker
[1:21:41] <Dingo_Eejit> yep, go 'round
[1:21:53] <Dingo_Eejit> the longish way
[1:22:09] <+firmlygraspi1> Satan loves Bowsette
[1:22:10] <Sundaysmiles01> Yeah, they died
[1:22:11] <Maids4lyfe> they're all dead
[1:22:14] <subnet255> they died
[1:22:14] <Commissar_Cornflakes> All dead
[1:22:16] <sonofthedeepsouth> Praetorians
[1:22:17] <BillieNoMates> They were Mars specific and died
[1:22:22] <Dingo_Eejit> They're dead Dave
[1:22:22] <sonofthedeepsouth> CLENCH THAT FIST
[1:22:23] <Commissar_Cornflakes> They got their shit pushed in
[1:22:26] <+Nomenanza> Praetor units got wiped in 1 second back in 2016 because Olivia had the killswitch
[1:22:28] <YoOctober> hggGasm
[1:22:34] <Fenlig> Someone kept steeling their chest chips so they ran out of funding
[1:22:35] <sonofthedeepsouth> LUL
[1:22:36] <+fingalights> They know how to make you wanna kill
[1:22:44] <Sundaysmiles01> that asari greeter
[1:22:45] <joanna9700> Oh fuck I see it yeah
[1:22:46] <Maids4lyfe> that's Jessica from HR
[1:22:49] <Kraahka> "We'll bang ok"
[1:22:52] <YakumoYomi> I see it
[1:22:52] <sonofthedeepsouth> Demons are welcome here LUL
[1:22:59] <+Nomenanza> reminds me of the current twitter userbase
[1:22:59] <Dingo_Eejit> ironic
[1:23:02] <Coldsabertooth> What level is this
[1:23:16] <+firmlygraspi1> who the fuck wrote that and thought it was good
[1:23:23] <sonofthedeepsouth> I actually liking tese jabs at woke corporate culture
[1:23:24] <s0lesurviv0r> it's Hyperion's Spokeswoman's annoying sister
[1:23:41] <peachteagaming> plague will now listen to death metal.
[1:23:46] <+Nomenanza> yeah runes are kind of unrewhelming now, you will always be using the 2nd chance one and the slowed time
[1:24:02] <megamonmon123> its useful for when you active one of the cheats where you can use all of em
[1:24:13] <LunarRemix> I think the problem is that you want different combinations of perks to feel like different playstyles, but most of the time is just "Use this weapon more or that weapon more"
[1:24:32] <$Rezca> HA HA HA
[1:24:33] <Fenlig> BoneStorm!!!!
[1:24:35] <+Nomenanza> jesus Eli why scream
[1:24:39] <Skeletonmanners> maybe you'd like something like Dusk more?
[1:24:44] <ahaegotrigger> LUL
[1:24:46] <+fingalights> Wanna do the pew pew
[1:24:49] <YakumoYomi> Eli scream
[1:24:50] <lucidcalyx> Satan?
[1:24:52] <Futurecity10> its fucked that eli has such a vocal range
[1:24:55] <Commissar_Cornflakes> Yeah, have you played Dusk?
[1:24:58] <Commissar_Cornflakes> Or Amid Evil?
[1:25:07] <Fenlig> Dusk is good but it goes on too long and the enemies get too bullet spongy
[1:25:08] <sonofthedeepsouth> OOf
[1:25:16] <joanna9700> Wait it's bethesda?
[1:25:21] <joanna9700> Where's the glitches
[1:25:21] <sonofthedeepsouth> Bethesda: We make Linear games now
[1:25:25] <lucidcalyx> Remember that Chex Doom rip-off? Yeah me either
[1:25:32] <DickChapyGaming> just Bethesda published
[1:25:33] <sublethalrex01> It’s ID, not Bethesda. They’re the publisher.
[1:25:37] <Commissar_Cornflakes> It's not even a ripoff, it's a legitimate conversion WAD
[1:25:38] <sonofthedeepsouth> Morrowind will never be a model to be followed again
[1:25:39] <peachteagaming> plague needs a shoulder rub.
[1:25:43] <YakumoYomi> Chex Quest was the shit
[1:25:51] <Coldsabertooth> Sometimes secret areas require you to move a little forward
[1:25:52] <Commissar_Cornflakes> It really was
[1:25:52] <lucidcalyx> Chex quest!,
[1:25:53] <sonofthedeepsouth> Think about that chat
[1:25:57] <@Nightbot> Plague is a youtube animator and also streams at https://picarto.tv/Plague . Also: t-shirts! http://goo.gl/lze8QO
[1:26:01] <cap_bon> The game is really aggressive about wanting you to chainsaw enemies for ammo. Like 20 shotgun shells and basic bitch enemies take 2 shots
[1:26:04] <Commissar_Cornflakes> Chex Quest was so good it got a sequel
[1:26:04] <+fingalights> When we getting a Daggerfall like game
[1:26:13] <Dingo_Eejit> @Skeletonmanners - DUSK for all it's QUAKEiness is way more what I'd want out of a DOOM 2020
[1:26:16] <sonofthedeepsouth> Think about you will never have a bethesda game like morrowind again
[1:26:19] <sonofthedeepsouth> Yeah
[1:26:20] <lucidcalyx> Chex Quest by Bethesda
[1:26:25] <sonofthedeepsouth> It's shit aint
[1:26:31] <+firmlygraspi1> replaying LISA made me realize I love having many options more than anything else in the world
[1:26:38] <peachteagaming> brutal chex quest
[1:26:49] <YakumoYomi> Precious antique coin
[1:27:03] <+Nomenanza> sentinel lore is really confusing
[1:27:10] <lucidcalyx> Somebody tell Eli he needs to play Chex Quest
[1:27:18] <sonofthedeepsouth> That phantom is kneeling in the middle of the national anthem
[1:27:19] <$Rezca> it is strongly recommended to ice those ho's
[1:27:23] <peachteagaming> snake demon thinks your sexy
[1:27:24] <+Xalgar> @PlagueOfGripes RIP Controller users LUL
[1:27:28] <sonofthedeepsouth> I mean Eli they are demons
[1:27:30] <YakumoYomi> Snek Bitch needs that human dick to chill
[1:27:36] <+Nomenanza> snake bois are one of the more annoying enemies, as they can lower their hitbox
[1:27:48] <CyberDingus> snek bitches just wanted some lovin'
[1:27:52] <+Nomenanza> and for how nimble they are they are durable
[1:27:56] <+Nomenanza> which is weird
[1:28:00] <Skeletonmanners> Plague, the cheat code is near the place you use the keys on
[1:28:01] <sonofthedeepsouth> Snake girls actually
[1:28:04] <Coldsabertooth> I don’t think Plague likes this game
[1:28:09] <+fingalights> Skeleton Snake people
[1:28:10] <FennecZephyr> Ugh, this game's dumb
[1:28:15] <FennecZephyr> I liked 2016 a lot more
[1:28:19] <peachteagaming> sexy skeleton
[1:28:22] <$daveronald> what if Haru was a skeleton?
[1:28:24] <Kraahka> Lamia waifus are my favs
[1:28:24] <DesuDesuDokiDoki> this game is great
[1:28:25] <sonofthedeepsouth> How does that work with paige? Skeletons have nothing down there
[1:28:27] <joanna9700> I like how this includes the Krang from TMNT
[1:28:29] <megamonmon123> why is this game dumb?
[1:28:30] <lucidcalyx> The thing
[1:28:30] <sniffy77> would paige have a preference between a dead skeleton or a alive skeleton?
[1:28:41] <sniffy77> both animated
[1:28:46] <Kraahka> Haru, you mean Hal 9000
[1:28:54] <megamonmon123> alive skeleton, personality is important @sniffy77
[1:29:01] <+fingalights> What?? What's the diff between dead or alive Skeleton?
[1:29:11] <+Xalgar> Woolie finding a new wacky tech solution LUL
[1:29:28] <+Punishedkaiger> Split fullscreen? On Facebook? Get outta here
[1:29:28] <Coldsabertooth> @sniffy77 I feel like she would say yes
[1:29:31] <megamonmon123> maybe he can plug skype into his xbox and have it work that way
[1:29:32] <peachteagaming> defeat the demons with my testicals
[1:29:40] <Ds1597_tw> Those snake guys remind me of a similar enemy type in Ninja Gaiden 3 . I loathe them
[1:29:40] <$daveronald> I'll tell him fighting games are lame
[1:29:45] <sonofthedeepsouth> Breaking news Capcom gives up all plans to utilize rollback code
[1:29:51] <joanna9700> No the game is just faster
[1:29:52] <Hydrapissed> getting slower
[1:29:57] <sonofthedeepsouth> Send this fake announcement to woolie
[1:29:58] <+Nomenanza> this is one of the more evil setups
[1:30:04] <kingdovachief> Hi plague
[1:30:06] <sonofthedeepsouth> Oh man challenge
[1:30:20] <$daveronald> borrow some of Paige's meds
[1:30:24] <Hydrapissed> no
[1:30:26] <imperator_lizard> no
[1:30:27] <YakumoYomi> Not without more G Fuel
[1:30:30] <DesuDesuDokiDoki> ?
[1:30:36] <cap_bon> The game is removing animation frames as it goes on to make it harder
[1:30:38] <lucidcalyx> Plague is having an existential crisis
[1:30:40] <sonofthedeepsouth> oh shit thats cool
[1:30:42] <arkv01> daddy's just going to rip and tear some more
[1:30:45] <Sundaysmiles01> only if you get something else hard will you earn daddies love
[1:30:49] <Coldsabertooth> You will never win Daddy Paige’s love#
[1:30:49] <sonofthedeepsouth> I want that vinyl
[1:30:56] <kingdovachief> Daisy record
[1:30:59] <+fingalights> Rabbits are the most Metal
[1:30:59] <joanna9700> It'd a circle
[1:31:03] <Rumbutt> Daisy is metal af
[1:31:04] <KitsuneManami> @PlagueOfGripes They put that in for Lore callback
[1:31:04] <$daveronald> because if the implications
[1:31:11] <peachteagaming> cannibal corpse bunny
[1:31:15] <Skeletonmanners> @PlagueOfGripes the cheat code is in the area you're in
[1:31:17] <joanna9700> Krang!
[1:31:21] <+KaijuUltimax> It's so anti-thetical to metal that it becomes metal again
[1:31:23] <Futurecity10> @PlagueOfGripes Btw, I think infinite ammo is in this area
[1:31:31] <+Xalgar> You kept shooting LUL
[1:31:43] <Sundaysmiles01> now you learning
[1:31:51] <$Rezca> did not ever see that kill before
[1:31:56] <+Nomenanza> yeah fodder enemies constantly respawn as you fight the biggoid
[1:32:00] <KitsuneManami> @PlagueOfGripes What Difficulty you on?? Clearly not Hard
[1:32:09] <Sundaysmiles01> also that demon literally 'REeeeee'd when you killed it
[1:32:12] <Skeletonmanners> the cheat is behind the keyholes
[1:32:15] <Skeletonmanners> supposedly
[1:32:20] <+Nomenanza> also there is one glory kill on arachnatron where doomguy just flips it over and it for some reason explodes
[1:32:28] <BillieNoMates> Itts under the gore nest supposedly
[1:32:31] <megamonmon123> hurt me plenty
[1:32:34] <Commissar_Cornflakes> Hurt Me Plenty?
[1:32:35] <+Xalgar> The high emphasis on mobility makes me think that this game must feel really uncomfortable on a controller
[1:32:40] <Valegator> secret below super gore nest gives you infinite ammo cheat
[1:32:43] <KitsuneManami> Im on above Hurt Me Plenty, its rough lol
[1:32:47] <+Xalgar> like how Overwatch feels like shit on a controller
[1:32:55] <Fenlig> other side
[1:32:56] <Valegator> other side
[1:32:57] <Futurecity10> @PlagueOfGripes Otherside
[1:32:58] <Commissar_Cornflakes> Traditionally, the 'real' difficulty is Ultraviolence.
[1:33:02] <megamonmon123> he seems like hes having fun
[1:33:05] <$Rezca> go around
[1:33:10] <+Nomenanza> nah there is a sewer entrance on the other side
[1:33:13] <Commissar_Cornflakes> Though in 2016 and 2020 the devs seem to lean Nightmare.
[1:33:15] <Futurecity10> @PlagueOfGripes There is another opening on the opposite side of that mouth
[1:33:21] <+Nomenanza> you can check on map where the entrance is
[1:33:33] <Sundaysmiles01> gotcha
[1:33:34] <+Nomenanza> there you go
[1:33:39] <Maids4lyfe> it doesn't
[1:33:40] <joanna9700> You got the bandanna!
[1:33:46] <Skeletonmanners> you use them in the hub zone
[1:33:48] <megamonmon123> you have to beat the level first
[1:33:49] <Maids4lyfe> cheats don't work except on finished levels
[1:33:57] <cap_bon> you unlocked "fun mode"
[1:33:58] <peachteagaming> don't copy that floppy
[1:34:09] <$Rezca> up one
[1:34:12] <+Nomenanza> Eli have you seen marauders? Back when you hosted Nic?
[1:34:20] <+Nomenanza> I think you are not gonna enjoy them at all
[1:34:29] <+Nomenanza> no one does
[1:34:34] <megamonmon123> i guess dark souls handles difficulty in a way you like then?
[1:34:35] <Futurecity10> @PlagueOfGripes Bad news, cheat codes can only be enabled on replays
[1:34:44] <+TaterBurglar> i lkke marauders
[1:35:14] <chowdah101> enter the gaping meat hole plague
[1:35:18] <peachteagaming> any sexy demons?
[1:35:20] <sniffy77> i don't really like the mauraders
[1:35:33] <Commissar_Cornflakes> That depends on how esoteric your tastes are, peach.
[1:35:35] <Fenlig> full on dark souls combat with them
[1:35:37] <+Nomenanza> yeah marauders arent particularly fun to fight, their toolset is a bit too much
[1:35:41] <$doomp12> you will LOATHE the marauder
[1:36:01] <peachteagaming> thats a hard maybe
[1:36:06] <+Xalgar> DESTINY LUL
[1:36:15] <megamonmon123> @nomenanza spam shotgun bomb and rockets so splash damage kills em
[1:36:30] <+pheblorganzardo> Operator, im in. Defend the console while i shut down the system.
[1:36:32] <+fingalights> I don't think may people do. They suck
[1:36:33] <LunarRemix> Does anyone?
[1:36:39] <whittacre> funny enough, that's what I'm doing right now
[1:36:46] <+Nomenanza> @megamonmon123 yeah I know, fought a bunch of them but it is still a huge ammo sink
[1:36:52] <cap_bon> How is warframe? I lost track after the hilarious space ship release
[1:37:19] <+pheblorganzardo> its still warframe
[1:37:32] <LunarRemix> @cap_bon They are about to release a update this week. Something to do with railjack and big squads
[1:37:34] <megamonmon123> @nomenanza no for sure
[1:37:45] <%Samex_Comex> Aw not the meat tower
[1:37:49] <+pheblorganzardo> they totally reworked status recently, fucked up some things fixed others
[1:37:53] <Fenlig> Lure him out with a small child
[1:38:02] <cap_bon> did they iron out all the bugs with big space ship junk
[1:38:09] <+pheblorganzardo> absolutely not lol
[1:38:10] <+TaterBurglar> you got to kill demons, that's the important part
[1:38:15] <Commissar_Cornflakes> You had two types of doom levels mostly
[1:38:16] <+pheblorganzardo> its better now but...
[1:38:19] <megamonmon123> rip and tear plague
[1:38:20] <Commissar_Cornflakes> techbases and hell stuff
[1:38:25] <GaspidarIII> why is everything made of ground beef?
[1:38:28] <lucidcalyx> Filled with Chex
[1:38:34] <peachteagaming> it wouldn't be to hard to be a satanic priest.
[1:38:39] <+pheblorganzardo> hell is the ground beef dimension, come on keep up
[1:38:41] <+Xalgar> I HATE old DOOM levels, I'm always lost trying to find a keycard LUL
[1:39:07] <ralphwiggum16> Super GOBLIN Nest?
[1:39:08] <Skeletonmanners> yea this feels like bethesda mandated this
[1:39:11] <Sundaysmiles01> What is all that xp rewards stuff?
[1:39:14] <+Nomenanza> Bethesda wanted a battle pass Eli
[1:39:17] <%Gogogolem> Gogogolem subscribed with Twitch Prime. They've subscribed for 10 months, currently on a 1 month streak! Doom
[1:39:17] <megamonmon123> you also unlock costumes yeah
[1:39:22] <BillieNoMates> Its just for multiplayer
[1:39:26] <Commissar_Cornflakes> To be fair a lot of people care about that kind of thing
[1:39:28] <Sundaysmiles01> ah
[1:39:30] <Commissar_Cornflakes> the widget collecting
[1:39:33] <mihokspawn> That bulllcrap is what Halo was built on
[1:39:35] <Kraahka> Yeah all of this is just some executive coming in and saying "add this so we make more money"
[1:39:38] <joanna9700> bethesda need feature for DLC
[1:39:45] <joanna9700> bethesda add silly profile picture
[1:39:52] <Fenlig> Hall wugging
[1:39:56] <%Gogogolem> !uptime
[1:39:57] <@Nightbot> 1 hour 40 minutes 7 seconds
[1:40:00] <+Nomenanza> there is I think 1 level in this game which comes close to the openness of classic Doom levels
[1:40:07] <Sundaysmiles01> I think so
[1:40:08] <peachteagaming> the demons speak aramaic.
[1:40:10] <megamonmon123> its doomslayer vs demons
[1:40:11] <Skeletonmanners> this game main mode is 2 vs 1
[1:40:13] <+Nomenanza> it has dark souls PvP, that you wanted actually
[1:40:13] <Valegator> Bunny profile pic for 3.99$
[1:40:14] <Sundaysmiles01> I think you can invade as a demon
[1:40:17] <+KaijuUltimax> It has an RE6 style invasion system
[1:40:18] <Skeletonmanners> 2 demons vs 1 doomguy
[1:40:29] <Kraahka> The last doom multiplayer was not great
[1:40:44] <+KaijuUltimax> Doom 2016 wasn't great but freeze tag was fun
[1:40:48] <megamonmon123> yep
[1:40:49] <Maids4lyfe> yes
[1:40:50] <Sundaysmiles01> yes he is
[1:40:50] <+Hiro01231> yes
[1:40:54] <megamonmon123> oh yeah hes an asshole
[1:41:00] <+Nomenanza> yeah big robo man from 2016, bitch stole yo sword
[1:41:05] <Sundaysmiles01> instead, he got fucked hard
[1:41:24] <+Xalgar> how does EVERYONE know who the Doom slayer is
[1:41:26] <Dingo_Eejit> "Oh no!" XD
[1:41:27] <+Nomenanza> I really like the upcoming level
[1:41:30] <+Hiro01231> challenged?
[1:41:40] <%caramello_man> Are there still people alive to hear this shit?
[1:41:44] <+Nomenanza> dont call them demons, they are mortally challenged @Hiro01231
[1:41:51] <megamonmon123> @xalgar hayden told em probably
[1:41:53] <transporterthesequel> Arc isn't, the UAC is
[1:41:58] <megamonmon123> plus hes a demon killing legend
[1:41:59] <peachteagaming> it is the delusion that mankind's passions are natural than doom man to hell.
[1:42:00] <Sundaysmiles01> HEY Don't use the D-Word!!! That is OUR word!
[1:42:05] <+pheblorganzardo> has anyone here seen the doom movie
[1:42:06] <+Queenemereldas> arc are the good guys
[1:42:07] <+Hiro01231> why do the people for killing them call them that is wht confuses me
[1:42:19] <Maids4lyfe> that's a different person
[1:42:20] <Commissar_Cornflakes> They were probably staddling both sides.
[1:42:25] <Commissar_Cornflakes> As you actually get shit done
[1:42:25] <+Hiro01231> exactly
[1:42:28] <CyberDingus> Eli, she wants to be a good girl for BOTH sides
[1:42:28] <Commissar_Cornflakes> they'll talk more shit
[1:42:29] <Skeletonmanners> ARC=/=UAC
[1:42:29] <$daveronald> gotta get that d
[1:42:29] <Maids4lyfe> ARC is not the UAC
[1:42:30] <CyberDingus> just in case.
[1:42:32] <transporterthesequel> ARC is a different organization than the UAC
[1:42:37] <Sundaysmiles01> ARC are essentially Sam Hayden's bitch boys getting assjacked by the UAC
[1:42:37] <BillieNoMates> She is hedging her bets on both sides
[1:42:39] <+SH1NK1R0> Its a pc culture joke
[1:42:43] <BillieNoMates> She wants that Doom Slayer Dick
[1:42:43] <Valegator> UAC is with demons. ARC is against them.
[1:42:47] <+Xalgar> @megamonmon123 I'd have thought he'd kept that classified
[1:42:48] <$Rezca> Mortally Challenged got too ingrained in the mind
[1:42:52] <joanna9700> Oh it's, PC stuff okay
[1:42:56] <%Gogogolem> Doom guy isn't listening.
[1:42:59] <Maids4lyfe> it makes sense if you read the lore
[1:43:04] <GarrisonWaifu> Its more Arcade-y
[1:43:11] <peachteagaming> hell is not fire, it is hopelessness.
[1:43:18] <joanna9700> That's just stupid
[1:43:21] <Kraahka> The lore of doom 2016 is great, they're trying to harvest energy from hell
[1:43:25] <rempai1> Yep
[1:43:34] <transporterthesequel> This is true yes
[1:43:34] <+Xalgar> It's the Dark Souls 2 of the DOOM series
[1:43:36] <%caramello_man> doom guy reading lore is not canon
[1:43:38] <%Gogogolem> Yeah thats fair.
[1:43:46] <RiverBirch> Whats your opinion on Doom 2016?
[1:43:54] <$daveronald> memes are always the real value
[1:44:01] <+Nomenanza> I liked it more than 2016, but 2016 integrated story in a better way
[1:44:09] <CyberDingus> so you can get out of closet, eli
[1:44:15] <joanna9700> Animal Crossing's the better game from what I can tell anyway :p
[1:44:18] <$Rezca> more subtelty in 2016 oddly enough
[1:44:19] <BillieNoMates> Doomguy is hands on
[1:44:23] <BillieNoMates> Nukes are for nerds and american
[1:44:25] <Nano_osecond> they did teleport in a nuke
[1:44:36] <peachteagaming> defeat hayden with jesus!
[1:44:39] <cap_bon> Nukes are unsporting
[1:44:58] <joanna9700> Just don't think
[1:44:59] <+fingalights> Was that demon dancing?
[1:44:59] <%Gogogolem> No plague please continue i came here specifically for this.
[1:45:16] <Sundaysmiles01> Oh, he gonna fight a new enemy!
[1:45:24] <Valegator> you could always download cheat engine
[1:45:48] <%JailShmixRemix> Thats exactly what we are doing plague :)
[1:46:04] <cap_bon> I dont have much reason to replay when the game tells me where all the secrets are
[1:46:07] <Fenlig> When I play it I find it pretty difficult to create proper sentences :D
[1:46:10] <@Nightbot> Plague is a youtube animator and also streams at https://picarto.tv/Plague . Also: t-shirts! http://goo.gl/lze8QO
[1:46:16] <Skeletonmanners> i mean yea if you're not enjoying yourself that much theres no reason to force yourself to play this
[1:46:38] <+mezz44> that execution LUL
[1:47:04] <ahaegotrigger> thats how I consume almost every game
[1:47:32] <+mezz44> I will give it this, the music is great
[1:47:38] <Skeletonmanners> some people would be dissapointed if you didnt continue but imo your enjoyement should be priority
[1:47:47] <Dingo_Eejit> Jesus, when I got here I was so glad to find out it wasn't just me - by the time I leave I'll be back to almost crying again...
[1:47:53] <+Xalgar> @PlagueOfGripes I feel like the same thing happened to John Wick, each sequel had to surpass the last one so it became less of John being a slick assassin and more gore porn and wacky hollywood highjinks
[1:47:58] <cap_bon> Thats what I did with Lisa after I wasnt having all that much fun with the combat
[1:48:40] <+Nomenanza> well, that is the same as saying "yeah I dont want to keep collecting my bloodstain in Dark Souls, I want to have my souls all the time", kind of ignoring intended design
[1:48:44] <Sundaysmiles01> I mean, not every game will be what you want it to be
[1:48:49] <BillieNoMates> Well you "don't have to" but you suffer for not doing it
[1:49:40] <Fenlig> I think there were a lot fewer enemies too
[1:49:43] <+Nomenanza> a lot of 2016's animations were just punches
[1:49:57] <+firmlygraspi1> MK9 really stepped it up with some of them
[1:49:59] <Dingo_Eejit> They're QTEs - simple as that
[1:50:02] <+mezz44> any enviornmental ones like slamming into walls? thought i remembered 2016 having some of those
[1:50:06] <Commissar_Cornflakes> That was fine, they were being conservative to not make them intrusive.
[1:50:31] <Commissar_Cornflakes> They've a bit more experience now so it's to be expected some will be a bit more indulgent.
[1:50:42] <+Xalgar> that guy fell into the ground LUL
[1:51:00] <sniffy77> sword base
[1:51:05] <+Nomenanza> a lot of people compared this to Halo city level yeah
[1:51:06] <xxshadowxx416> sword bssr
[1:51:09] <fabo_joyful> !UPTIME
[1:51:09] <@Nightbot> 1 hour 51 minutes 20 seconds
[1:51:10] <Commissar_Cornflakes> That's downright insulting, Eli
[1:51:18] <BillieNoMates> its Dead Space 4, angry Isaac stompaloo
[1:51:23] <Commissar_Cornflakes> Reach has a shockingly bad campaign
[1:51:41] <+Nomenanza> well it restores only 1 pip iirc
[1:51:51] <+Nomenanza> so that you always can get ammo from fodder enemies
[1:51:58] <xxshadowxx416> reach had a great canpaign
[1:52:03] <+Nomenanza> and in 2016 yeah it was basically an enemy skip
[1:52:05] <Skeletonmanners> yea like a bomb in a shmup
[1:52:11] <Skeletonmanners> save it up and use it in an emergency
[1:52:13] <Dingo_Eejit> 100%
[1:52:18] <+Nomenanza> so people didnt use it often enough, kind of like BFG
[1:52:22] <BillieNoMates> Can you break that door? Has a big crack in it
[1:52:41] <+firmlygraspi1> would be cool if the chainsaw was just charged up by kills
[1:52:48] <+Nomenanza> overall I liked the change to chainsaw in this, the only complaint is that now you cant clearly tell how much fuel you need for bigger demons
[1:52:55] <sniffy77> punch door
[1:53:06] <ralphwiggum16> plague what do you think happens to us after we die?
[1:53:07] <BillieNoMates> vertical
[1:53:10] <%Rezca> Rezca subscribed with Twitch Prime. They've subscribed for 4 months, currently on a 1 month streak! 
[1:53:12] <Commissar_Cornflakes> A big part of its design problem boils down to thinking throwing tons of enemies at you will make the battles more fun, but the spaces the battles happen in are not really catered to having fun.
[1:53:13] <+Nomenanza> signaling Eli, green lights
[1:53:25] <Commissar_Cornflakes> They also made some of the enemies - Elites, notably - absurd HP sinks.
[1:53:26] <+pheblorganzardo> 10 year old me thought reach was super emotional and sad
[1:53:30] <BillieNoMates> Idiot lights show the way, Eli
[1:53:45] <Commissar_Cornflakes> The vehicle segments are much more poorly-realized than the true trilogy
[1:53:47] <+stotans> follow green light
[1:53:51] <Commissar_Cornflakes> and the friendly AI is broken
[1:54:00] <Commissar_Cornflakes> the Spartans barely fight and the marines literally don't most of the time
[1:54:18] <Commissar_Cornflakes> Which the enemy AI seems to know since it will ignore them while they walk up to them and stand stock still.
[1:54:20] <BillieNoMates> Thats what they did in 2016
[1:54:27] <+justianxix> the uncharted thing
[1:54:30] <+Nomenanza> well that yellow thing I think is close to the coloring of monkey bars so I think they signal you that way too
[1:54:31] <BillieNoMates> Weird they changed it in this
[1:54:32] <cap_bon> Has there been a Halo game that uses the sick ass mecha armour yet
[1:54:38] <Commissar_Cornflakes> Yes.
[1:54:45] <Commissar_Cornflakes> Well, depending on your opinion of "sick"
[1:54:51] <Dingo_Eejit> BLUNCH
[1:54:53] <Commissar_Cornflakes> Most people fucking hated Halo 5.
[1:54:57] <+pheblorganzardo> at least it's better than warframes mindless "follow the yellow dot"
[1:55:10] <+stotans> I really hate that purple stuff
[1:55:37] <Commissar_Cornflakes> it's Ivan Ooze's ooze.
[1:55:43] <+mezz44> halo 5 kinda did suck, it changed a lot of things between it and 4
[1:55:51] <Commissar_Cornflakes> 4 wasn't good either.
[1:56:03] <+pheblorganzardo> halo has been steadily declining since 3
[1:56:09] <+mezz44> yup
[1:56:12] <Commissar_Cornflakes> The emotional core between the Chief and Cortana was fine, but the rest was trash.
[1:56:16] <Commissar_Cornflakes> The Covenant AI was like
[1:56:20] <Commissar_Cornflakes> early 2000s tier
[1:56:23] <+mezz44> albiet reach was fun at the time
[1:56:23] <Commissar_Cornflakes> Worse, actually
[1:56:27] <+Xalgar> this looks SO clumsy to play on a controller LUL
[1:56:38] <+pheblorganzardo> reach was flawed but alright
[1:56:43] <Commissar_Cornflakes> and the new mooks, whatever they're called, they're lame aesthetically and to fight
[1:56:56] <+pheblorganzardo> i think odst was the last great halo game
[1:57:02] <+mezz44> the one thing i remember reach for, custom games
[1:57:04] <sniffy77> i would love to see a discusssion between you and pat about this game because he completely loves it
[1:57:24] <+Nomenanza> oh yeah that animation in 2016 was cool
[1:57:31] <+mezz44> odst was glorious loved that iteration of firefight since it was hell
[1:57:40] <ralphwiggum16> STOP PRETENDING IT'S NOT COOL PLAGUE
[1:57:46] <ralphwiggum16> YOU'RE RUINING MY IMMERSION
[1:57:50] <+aspirationdeath> most people love it. plague likes games for plague and also to complain
[1:57:53] <BillieNoMates> Doomguy is an artist
[1:58:00] <+pheblorganzardo> reach had the best sandbox mode though, i remember wasting hours with my friends in that
[1:58:05] <Commissar_Cornflakes> It's his username.
[1:58:07] <+Nomenanza> well they have to find balance with it being elaborate and cool while also being fast and rhythmical
[1:58:17] <Commissar_Cornflakes> To do sick ramps off of, Eli
[1:58:18] <+mezz44> Doomguy: The Bob Ross of blood and gore
[1:58:22] <Commissar_Cornflakes> as a bicycle courier
[1:58:26] <lucidcalyx> Masks of Gohan was entertaining. Good job
[1:58:28] <Fenlig> Imagine if that was there for pedestrian crossings
[1:58:40] <LixFury> Express mail delivery Kappa
[1:59:09] <+pheblorganzardo> i watched all of plagues dragonball analysis videos recently, and as someone who has never watched an episode of dragonball they were very entertaining
[1:59:11] <+justianxix> I actually really like those fast ones
[1:59:19] <+Xalgar> You kind of feel bad for the pinkies FeelsBadMan
[1:59:22] <Commissar_Cornflakes> The ones where the demon's fear can be seen are best.
[1:59:27] <+Nomenanza> pinkies are basically dogs of hell
[1:59:28] <Commissar_Cornflakes> They reinforce the 2016 narrative conceit
[1:59:32] <Commissar_Cornflakes> 'the demons are afraid of you'
[1:59:35] <+Nomenanza> and canonically taste delicious too
[1:59:37] <+justianxix> But I feel what you mean
[1:59:37] <GarrisonWaifu> We must know that the demons are suffering, this is important
[1:59:47] <Commissar_Cornflakes> Right, exactly.
[1:59:51] <Dingo_Eejit> Like Sharkticons?
[2:00:03] <+mezz44> weren't pinkies used as a food source in hell? from what i remember of 2016's lore
[2:00:03] <+Xalgar> Holy shit that gun is cool
[2:00:22] <joanna9700> Why not just go play the better game then
[2:00:25] <+justianxix> You want to stare into their eyes as they lose the sparkle of their lives
[2:00:28] <+firmlygraspi1> CROSS COUNTER
[2:00:30] <cap_bon> Its a good thing it overheats or you would have no ammo after 4 seconds LUL
[2:00:37] <lacroximus> Plague prefers the knife, guns are too quick. You don’t get to savour the small emotions.
[2:00:53] <BillieNoMates> Time to use the BLUD
[2:01:08] <+aspirationdeath> you can also just shoot them a bunch
[2:02:03] <Rodzzila> the Mancubus look so dumb compere to the 2016 version
[2:02:07] <Fenlig> They didn't want to interrupt the pace of the gameplay
[2:02:13] <Sundaysmiles01> if they were slowed down, you'd complain they were taking it too long because of how many you were doing
[2:02:31] <+mezz44> agreed the mancubus seems like a little puppy compared to 2016
[2:02:35] <+justianxix> Ever once in a while a kill like that is fine and good
[2:02:36] <Zebroneath> It bugs me how the chainsaw is technically a glory kill, but doesn't count for Blood Punch.
[2:02:37] <Commissar_Cornflakes> I think the slow ones need to be rare, because they get old and tired too quickly. The speed and dismissiveness with which Doom Guy does these glory kills is also communicative of his character and less annoying to the player.
[2:02:41] <%Rezca> so more enemy struggling as they die?
[2:02:43] <Commissar_Cornflakes> But yeah, showing the demon's fear is best.
[2:02:58] <+Xalgar> Add a rare kill animation where Doomguy just pulls all the guts out of a demon and just smothers himself in it, restoring HP
[2:03:00] <Fenlig> Image these kill animations but its a class of duty game :D
[2:03:01] <lucidcalyx> You’re one sick puppy. Keep talking
[2:03:05] <Fenlig> call*
[2:03:05] <+aspirationdeath> the animations for berserm are fucking gold
[2:03:14] <+aspirationdeath> berserk*
[2:03:17] <+justianxix> Like that instance with getting the double shotgun?
[2:03:28] <RiverBirch> actually wait
[2:03:32] <RiverBirch> Where is the Berserk Power up?
[2:03:39] <RiverBirch> I've not seen it show up yet
[2:03:41] <%Rezca> later on for that powerup
[2:03:48] <+zombieghost1337> its still in the game but its much more rare @RiverBirch
[2:03:57] <+Xalgar> This whole game is a Mick Gordon music video
[2:03:58] <+zombieghost1337> i found one in my entire playthrough
[2:03:59] <cap_bon> Like having them try and fight the chainsaw by like trying to push your arm back or hit you
[2:04:29] <+Xalgar> probably gives all upgrades
[2:04:30] <RiverBirch> Auto unlock weapon masterys for stuff
[2:04:34] <+zombieghost1337> weapon mastery gives you the final tier of upgrade for all weapons
[2:04:41] <BillieNoMates> LORE
[2:04:42] <shevan123> its one of these
[2:04:45] <Sundaysmiles01> oh here we go...
[2:04:50] <+pheblorganzardo> L o RE
[2:04:54] <Dingo_Eejit> iiiiiisssssss
[2:04:54] <%Rezca> I miss the deep demon voice
[2:04:54] <Sundaysmiles01> the new messiah
[2:05:02] <+justianxix> well, this is a research base
[2:05:07] <BillieNoMates> He has angel aids
[2:05:20] <+realm_forge> Weapon mastery is a challenge that makes weapons exponentially better
[2:05:20] <+Nomenanza> no joke
[2:05:31] <shevan123> dont worry plague, it gets worse
[2:05:44] <CyberDingus> she thirsty
[2:05:47] <CyberDingus> very thirsty
[2:05:48] <Sundaysmiles01> BUT WAIT!!! THERES MORE
[2:05:49] <$doomp12> oh ya work the shaft
[2:05:55] <+Xalgar> TAKE THAT ATHIESTS
[2:05:55] <Skeletonmanners> BLOOD TYPE: GOD
[2:05:59] <cap_bon> Scientists: mmm yes doomslayer you taste so good
[2:06:02] <fabo_joyful> DOOMGOD Also she wants that doom dick
[2:06:03] <Dingo_Eejit> eugh
[2:06:13] <+zombieghost1337> the sentinel logs are much more grounded on doom guy
[2:06:19] <+pheblorganzardo> constantly sucking doomguys dick makes him less cool honestly
[2:06:38] <Sundaysmiles01> yeah
[2:06:39] <Commissar_Cornflakes> It's not interesting when humans do it
[2:06:46] <Commissar_Cornflakes> it worked best when the demons did it
[2:06:50] <Commissar_Cornflakes> and it worked because it was new
[2:06:54] <Commissar_Cornflakes> and because it made sense
[2:06:59] <Commissar_Cornflakes> because Doom Guy is a one man genocide
[2:07:07] <+justianxix> Well think about it, this one guy is the only guy doing anything in this whole disaster
[2:07:08] <+Xalgar> how did they collect blood samples from Doom Guy?
[2:07:14] <Commissar_Cornflakes> and the game acknowledging that in a wya it never had before was enjoyable
[2:07:14] <Sundaysmiles01> linegun
[2:07:15] <LixFury> This thing really needs its upgrades
[2:07:22] <Commissar_Cornflakes> He was in stasis for a while, Xalgar
[2:07:31] <+Punishedkaiger> @PlagueOfGripes It might have a variable charge for it
[2:07:32] <Rodzzila> Wasn't his body protected by some mumbo jumbo in 2016? So how did they get a blood sample?
[2:07:35] <+Punishedkaiger> Or it upgrades
[2:07:43] <+Xalgar> @Commissar_Cornflakes Yeah but he was still stuck in the Sarcophagus
[2:07:49] <+zombieghost1337> his tissue isn't rare at all, if you read logs his blood is in most areas he visits
[2:07:53] <+Xalgar> so how did they get him out for a blood sample
[2:08:03] <Commissar_Cornflakes> Drilled through it? Couldn't say.
[2:08:10] <Wolverine2200> What difficulty is he on?
[2:08:16] <Commissar_Cornflakes> babby
[2:08:24] <+SH1NK1R0> They broke him out. He was asleep while they exmined him
[2:08:28] <+Xalgar> I wish the melee was WAY better
[2:08:31] <Commissar_Cornflakes> They kept him deliberately in his box because Hayden didn't want him to go apeshit unless they needed him to
[2:08:33] <Kraahka> I mean wasn't the casket opened when doom 2016 started
[2:08:41] <Jack_of_No_Trades> doors stuck
[2:08:43] <Commissar_Cornflakes> And obviously the hell cult on Mars wanted him to STAY asleep
[2:08:45] <BillieNoMates> Can't break MDF doors
[2:08:52] <BillieNoMates> They are doomguys weakness
[2:08:54] <+zombieghost1337> the casket was open because he was to be released @Kraahka
[2:08:56] <+pheblorganzardo> seriously though, the advertising promised us a cool sword
[2:08:58] <+Xalgar> Imagine if the punch of Halo levels of damage
[2:09:06] <BillieNoMates> Its landing
[2:09:12] <Fenlig> not if you go this way
[2:09:19] <joanna9700> Don't think
[2:09:20] <Kraahka> He was just lying in an open casket for a while and they were studying him
[2:09:41] <+Xalgar> Oh ok
[2:09:53] <%Rezca> ok, I have no idea where this is going
[2:09:58] <Jack_of_No_Trades> snalien
[2:10:00] <+justianxix> oh here we go
[2:10:06] <sniffy77> one negative i have with this game is the monkey bars are a bit finnicky
[2:10:08] <+fingalights> Lord Slug is someone different
[2:10:12] <Rodzzila> The casket was open, but his body had some extra shit that make it so he couldn't be kill. So no idea how they get the blood then.
[2:10:13] <Kraahka> Cause that was the whole cutscene where a demon walks up to you and you barely break free in time to punch it
[2:10:23] <Birdigalore> Went from literal Satan to Marvin the Martian
[2:10:39] <+mezz44> an angry man motivated by a dead pet bunny
[2:10:47] <+edited156> It's to the right after the second pole
[2:10:47] <+zombieghost1337> he is still just a normal guy they just juiced him up so he doesnt die from heart failure
[2:10:49] <+mezz44> least in the old games
[2:10:49] <RiverBirch> I like Really angry man better than supped up hero.
[2:10:58] <joanna9700> They told us instead of just letting him show how he's too angry to die
[2:11:08] <+Xalgar> I have yet to see a SINGLE PERSON do this part right first try. The light sources are so bad LUL
[2:11:12] <Skeletonmanners> yea i miss literally just an army guy thats good at shooting
[2:11:17] <Commissar_Cornflakes> Hey guys, you know what Doom needed more of? Platforming.
[2:11:30] <KitsuneManami> @PlagueOfGripes When are game companies gonna learn to stop using Hip Hop, Rap and Punk Rock in Trailers for Games?
[2:11:31] <RiverBirch> WTF IS SHINING LIGHT ON THOSE CLIMING WALLS
[2:11:37] <+fingalights> Orb
[2:11:39] <+zombieghost1337> his in lore "changes" from the original doom is that they just made him more durable and trained him some on melee
[2:11:55] <+SH1NK1R0> I dunno. I get the tone is way less consistent but the story was never important and the gameplay loop feels better.
[2:12:05] <Commissar_Cornflakes> Yeah, but giving him space steroids is not like
[2:12:10] <Commissar_Cornflakes> an enhancement to his character
[2:12:25] <Commissar_Cornflakes> We don't need an excuse for why Doom Guy is so good, he just is.
[2:12:32] <BillieNoMates> punchable wall there, eli
[2:12:36] <+justianxix> he is still essentially the same character
[2:12:52] <Birdigalore> Doom 2016 the story was there but it was dumb and Doomguy didnt give a damn, but in Eternal its like "No you WILL learn the story, god dammit!"
[2:12:56] <+Xalgar> The platforming feels ok on PC, but on a controller, I imagine it's awful with the turn speed LUL
[2:13:16] <Wolverine2200> Yeah this game was clearly not made to be played on controller
[2:13:21] <BillieNoMates> In 2016, it seemed like the lore was a joke and was irrelevant
[2:13:23] <Commissar_Cornflakes> And the Doom 2016 story's farcical nature held up slightly more to logic.
[2:13:25] <Kraahka> The lore is actually pretty interesting in Doom 2016, it's just an optional unobtrusive part of exploration
[2:13:25] <+fingalights> Blocks were people
[2:13:49] <Sundaysmiles01> LOL
[2:13:52] <+Taglog7> Kreygasm BlessRNG
[2:13:53] <CyberDingus> THE THIRST IS REAL
[2:13:55] <ahaegotrigger> shes just GUSHING
[2:13:57] <Birdigalore> "Tell me how I'm a God"
[2:14:00] <Birdigalore> "He's a God"
[2:14:01] <joanna9700> hE gOd
[2:14:01] <transporterthesequel> Yeah they took the WRONG lesson from Doom 2016's story
[2:14:04] <+fingalights> When you break a block, you are destroying a Toad
[2:14:04] <+Taglog7> calm down jessie
[2:14:05] <Commissar_Cornflakes> Is she simping for Doom Guy
[2:14:07] <joanna9700> I hate this
[2:14:07] <ahaegotrigger> She wants his Gun Barrel SO BAD
[2:14:09] <joanna9700> So much
[2:14:10] <Bacon_Rage> xd very cool
[2:14:16] <+pheblorganzardo> please doomguy, just punch the console
[2:14:17] <Wolverine2200> Bro that's what she's saying
[2:14:21] <joanna9700> HE'S JUST AN ANGRY MAN WITH A SHOTGUN
[2:14:22] <transporterthesequel> VERY cool
[2:14:23] <Masamune84> They killed his rabbit
[2:14:25] <%Rezca> the story jumps over multiple sharks
[2:14:29] <CyberDingus> She wants that dick all the way her SCIENTIFIC throat
[2:14:29] <Sundaysmiles01> She hungry for that Doom Dick
[2:14:30] <CyberDingus> good lord
[2:14:31] <ahaegotrigger> it just sounds like shes Shlicking herself while she said it
[2:14:32] <Commissar_Cornflakes> She seriously sounds like she's masturbating during them
[2:14:36] <LixFury> Thats the joke
[2:14:37] <ahaegotrigger> YES
[2:14:37] <KitsuneManami> @PlagueOfGripes Guess it needs to be Silent and voiceless for you to enjoy it like Dark Souls? :P
[2:14:43] <Fenlig> I'd vote for him
[2:14:55] <Dark_Wint3r> You can only do a "the story doesn't matter" so many times before it just becomes a just looter shooter where you don't care about anything
[2:15:00] <+fingalights> He's a Man of Action!!, Not a Man of Words
[2:15:02] <Sokumotanaka> I think it's what SHE thinks not what the narrative is trying to go for. it's her horniness
[2:15:02] <+Punishedkaiger> But plague, the spin feels good
[2:15:06] <RiverBirch> You can enchange phone #'s with the dick
[2:15:07] <Fenlig> I want him to glory kill my dick!
[2:15:07] <transporterthesequel> No explode tho
[2:15:11] <Sundaysmiles01> the thing is.... there's plenty of people irl that would do that
[2:15:20] <KitsuneManami> we still Pretending that Dark Soul's Lore is "Good"? XD
[2:15:20] <Sundaysmiles01> make something our of nothing
[2:15:31] <Commissar_Cornflakes> Yeah but we avoid those people IRL
[2:15:42] <Commissar_Cornflakes> No one wants to deal with a creepy simp in their Doom game
[2:15:55] <Rodzzila> man, those audio are cringe as fuck
[2:15:59] <Commissar_Cornflakes> buy yourself a vibrator and read some Nietzsche lady
[2:16:09] <Commissar_Cornflakes> don't record your fapfiction for us to be embarrassed over
[2:16:19] <KitsuneManami> Are you Wearing his armor?
[2:16:36] <BillieNoMates> got to earn that damnation
[2:16:37] <Skeletonmanners> Original Sin jokje?
[2:16:38] <+Xalgar> Wait, did they REMOVE power ups in Eternal?
[2:16:39] <BillieNoMates> Eat them fetuses
[2:16:40] <Skeletonmanners> Joke*
[2:16:40] <Sundaysmiles01> gotta sin to win
[2:16:44] <+fingalights> Being successful is a sin
[2:16:44] <joanna9700> Sinning is success and union with demonkind is good
[2:16:50] <Wolverine2200> @Xalgar no
[2:16:54] <KitsuneManami> and Dark Souls is perfect we geeet it! :P
[2:16:56] <+Punishedkaiger> They went overboard with the evil corporation
[2:17:06] <+Xalgar> @Wolverine2200 he hasn't picked one up for like, an hour
[2:17:14] <%caramello_man> "just standing there holding muh coin, listening to that dumb bitch"
[2:17:28] <Commissar_Cornflakes> Did they? 2016 UAC literally had advertising for you to volunteer for the Revenant program.
[2:17:32] <CyberDingus> huehuehueheuhue
[2:17:34] <+justianxix> LUL
[2:17:34] <+pheblorganzardo> doomguy really did turn into knuckles
[2:17:36] <Sundaysmiles01> lol eli
[2:17:49] <Wolverine2200> @Xalgar That doesn't mean they're not in the game lol, they're scattered
[2:17:55] <Kraahka> The lore in 2016 is all about how humanity is going through an energy crisis and getting more desperate, it's implemented much more smoothly than in this game
[2:18:01] <+Xalgar> THAT'S SOME TUROK 2 SHIT PogChamp
[2:18:12] <joanna9700> It's a cool crossbow
[2:18:24] <Fenlig> He just wanted to save his fat friend
[2:18:52] <CrmznOgre> hey Uncle Plague
[2:19:13] <+justianxix> Thats a new one
[2:20:06] <KitsuneManami> Wait, what game?
[2:20:26] <+Xalgar> Have you gotten a single berserk power up?
[2:20:32] <Rodzzila> What change to ammo?
[2:20:37] <+pheblorganzardo> who doesnt love randomly firing energy blasts into the sky
[2:20:40] <+Oprender> Is this the dark souls 2 and 3 lore-through waiting room? @plagueofgripes Pog
[2:20:40] <+SH1NK1R0> You started shooting him with a shotgun from max range and never aim for any weakpoints. Yeah it takes a bit.
[2:20:52] <LixFury> I like it, but i wish there was an option to relax the ammo limit abit
[2:20:54] <Skeletonmanners> something went wrong somewhere if a reaction to an enemy in a doom game is ugh
[2:21:07] <BillieNoMates> Need to ass shot the pinkies
[2:21:08] <Skeletonmanners> i mean i beat Doom 2 recently and by the end of that game i was the same lol
[2:21:10] <BillieNoMates> Was the same in 2016
[2:21:11] <+Xalgar> That gun looks so good but what is that damage LUL
[2:21:15] <%Rezca> huh, so you can kill them from the front
[2:21:42] <+jetjagger222> @Skeletonmanners TWO PAIN ELEMENTALS, AH AH AH
[2:21:46] <Futurecity10> @PlagueOfGripes When you set them on fire, its best to shoo tthem with a fast weapon
[2:22:38] <Commissar_Cornflakes> Because the hell cult was on earth already.
[2:22:47] <Skeletonmanners> you wish it was just two
[2:23:01] <+SH1NK1R0> In 2016 hellgate was opened
[2:23:04] <BillieNoMates> bleeding edge is the top 1% of tech
[2:23:10] <Commissar_Cornflakes> 'bleeding edge' is a term to describe tech that's absolutely new as hell
[2:23:14] <MESeele> bleeding edge is still experimental. An actual term
[2:23:17] <BillieNoMates> Its the cutting edge of cutting edge
[2:23:19] <Commissar_Cornflakes> yeah
[2:23:36] <CyberDingus> SPOOKY medics
[2:23:49] <+pheblorganzardo> a crew of skeleton scientists
[2:23:56] <CyberDingus> they try their best Eli !
[2:24:00] <%Rezca> reminds me of Kenshi
[2:24:14] <+shadowace2400> well, they're trying their best to wake him up?
[2:24:21] <+phone5> bleeding edge means the newest toy
[2:24:24] <+shadowace2400> and they don't know how?
[2:24:27] <CyberDingus> @Rezca Skeletons are for deepthroating the paladin cross for everything they did !
[2:24:41] <RiverBirch> Imagine reincarnating as an imp in doom
[2:24:43] <RiverBirch> That'd fuckin suck
[2:24:51] <Fenlig> Its probably those two
[2:24:57] <+arancet> its those two, behind the barrier
[2:25:01] <+arancet> have to lure them out
[2:25:03] <+arancet> its a stupid bug
[2:25:16] <cap_bon> do demons enjoy being chainsawed
[2:25:17] <+twohitgood> it's the guys behind the barrier
[2:25:18] <+justianxix> I think it was just those two
[2:25:52] <joanna9700> What's that orb thing
[2:25:56] <@Nightbot> Plague is a youtube animator and also streams at https://picarto.tv/Plague . Also: t-shirts! http://goo.gl/lze8QO
[2:25:58] <joanna9700> The one by the suit point
[2:26:01] <joanna9700> o
[2:26:03] <+SH1NK1R0> Wow ive never seen this happen here
[2:26:11] <+arancet> happened to me
[2:26:14] <Sundaysmiles01> SLAPFIGHT
[2:26:17] <Skeletonmanners> oh this wacky game
[2:26:27] <+twohitgood> that happened to pat, too.
[2:26:41] <Kraahka> Nah you can see a bunch of em shooting each other at the start of fights
[2:26:47] <+SH1NK1R0> Really? Must have missed it
[2:27:11] <+SH1NK1R0> That sucks
[2:27:25] <cap_bon> imagine having a gun that feels fun in doom
[2:27:36] <+twohitgood> pat didn't really notice it. he killed the guys and the barrier opened. pretty quick exchange .
[2:27:42] <RiverBirch> Doom Eternally...mediocre?
[2:28:22] <%Rezca> Here is the best powerup room
[2:29:27] <LixFury> 2Smart enough to regret its life choices
[2:29:28] <%Rezca> this has gotten rather dark
[2:29:28] <Futurecity10> @PlagueOfGripes apparently there is a rabbit in every level. Neat
[2:29:30] <%Samex_Comex> Bah?
[2:29:31] <RiverBirch> D:
[2:29:38] <+justianxix> this is a real pleasure discussion
[2:29:42] <cap_bon> plague needs to look them in the eyes as he sees the life fade away
[2:29:44] <RiverBirch> That feel when you remember Plague is a farmer
[2:29:57] <Skeletonmanners> Pinkies seem to be the exact same model as Doom 2016
[2:30:04] <Skeletonmanners> like imps and shit are redesigned but not Pinkies
[2:30:55] <The_Slag_Bag> Baba is dead
[2:30:57] <ahaegotrigger> jesus
[2:31:13] <+Oprender> What an american thing to say
[2:31:21] <+Xalgar> Finally! a Power up
[2:31:22] <+pheblorganzardo> o shit a berserker powerup
[2:31:26] <ahaegotrigger> LUL RIP AND TEAR
[2:31:33] <BonemanJohn> Slower Berserk than 2016 huh?
[2:31:34] <Commissar_Cornflakes> Okay, these berserk kills are WAY better than in 2016
[2:31:34] <powerlessimp0> Poor thing, geez, your brothers aight as adults now? pvpS
[2:31:39] <LunarRemix> Not even a little bit sad for killing an animal they raised?
[2:31:41] <+Xalgar> It feels like it's been like, 2 hours without a power up LUL
[2:31:56] <%Rezca> you can
[2:31:59] <BillieNoMates> Probably can
[2:32:12] <BillieNoMates> It was berserk, It worked on everything in 2016
[2:32:12] <+pheblorganzardo> you hear that everyone? plague's torn a sheep in half with his bare hands
[2:32:19] <Kraahka> That's what animal husbandry be like
[2:33:05] <BillieNoMates> shoot it in the ass
[2:33:08] <+SH1NK1R0> Should they wait then?
[2:33:23] <+justianxix> Just dodge and aim for the tail
[2:33:28] <powerlessimp0> I think plague is saying he wants them to do more damage
[2:33:45] <Rodzzila> to be fair the slap is pathetic because you are in baby difficulty LUL
[2:33:50] <+SH1NK1R0> Hes on easy tho
[2:33:50] <RiverBirch> Who was your first? oxo
[2:33:59] <powerlessimp0> I’d imagine
[2:34:00] <%Rezca> the farm makes one closely intimate with death I see
[2:34:14] <%bettysharkface> NotLikeThis NotLikeThis NotLikeThis
[2:34:40] <powerlessimp0> Only animal I ever saw die was my dog when I was 15
[2:35:32] <+jetjagger222> its similar to the doom 2 death scream
[2:35:40] <Skeletonmanners> that scream sounds like the noise those things make in Doom 2 yea
[2:35:46] <Skeletonmanners> tho it more sounds like a pc shutting down in doom 2 case
[2:35:55] <powerlessimp0> It’s very visceral
[2:35:59] <cap_bon> Is barking all the time at shit thats not there more of an outdoor dog kinda thing?
[2:36:06] <sniffy77> plague you have ice bombs, grenades, and a entire bloody punch
[2:36:15] <Skeletonmanners> in 2016 enemies sometimes dropped ammo on death even without chainsaw
[2:36:17] <+Punishedkaiger> There was an ammo can right next to you
[2:36:20] <Skeletonmanners> kinda dumb they dont in this
[2:36:23] <%Rezca> Press G please
[2:36:29] <+justianxix> weird, usually there would be more small dudes to slice
[2:36:33] <+jetjagger222> i wish it allowed you to chainsaw staggered enemies for 1 unit of fuel instead of glory kill
[2:36:39] <+Xalgar> @PlagueOfGripes How do you feel about all these vegan meat replacements going around?
[2:36:53] <Commissar_Cornflakes> they taste like shit
[2:37:02] <$daveronald> even a produce farm
[2:37:11] <+twohitgood> the game definitely wants you to be using the flame burp and chainsaw regularly
[2:37:44] <BillieNoMates> portal
[2:37:53] <powerlessimp0> I suppose
[2:37:54] <+zee_generate> I', more sad/annoyed when raccoons eat my chickens.
[2:38:00] <%Rezca> portal down that cliff
[2:38:01] <Phant0m_Hero> same
[2:38:09] <+jetjagger222> i had a pair of doves once that got killed by rats
[2:38:22] <powerlessimp0> Oh yeah there was also the time I saw sting ray get killed on a rock and cleaned
[2:38:24] <%bettysharkface> I mean, I'll feel sadder when my dog dies than when my Granma died, cause Granma was like 87, but Trico if she's lucky will only live to 20-ish. If she lives that long I'll be fine with it, but if she died right now I'd be devastated.
[2:38:50] <cap_bon> as lnog as I dont go out 90 years old with my family saying "do all you can to keep them alive" because I've seen what do waht ever you can means
[2:38:58] <powerlessimp0> I was morbidly curious so I watched the whole process
[2:39:09] <powerlessimp0> Dock*
[2:39:14] <$daveronald> Impossible burger at A&W was pretty good
[2:39:28] <ahaegotrigger> LUL
[2:39:36] <+Xalgar> @PlagueOfGripes I'm Californian and that's so true LUL
[2:39:42] <+jetjagger222> berkeley intensifies
[2:39:58] <%bettysharkface> It boggles my mind that some people don't know where meat comes from
[2:40:01] <+jetjagger222> chickens are horrible cruel creatures though
[2:40:02] <$daveronald> so eat cows
[2:40:33] <+Punishedkaiger> I like that they use a high pressure piston for killing cows
[2:40:40] <+Punishedkaiger> It's a funny little solution
[2:40:43] <powerlessimp0> I had a hard time looking at chicken nuggets again after watching “supersize me” in school
[2:40:50] <+zee_generate> Home chicken eggs are way better anyways.
[2:40:52] <%bettysharkface> I do think everyone should try to keep a chicken for eggs, two if they can.
[2:40:53] <GOOPAHIPHOP> honestly pleasantly surprise by this farm side of yours plague
[2:41:09] <RiverBirch> Supersize me though was fake trash
[2:41:10] <%Rezca> Yeah... I feel you just gotta move that gun over a bit
[2:41:13] <+twohitgood> supersize me was such a shit movie.
[2:41:15] <+SH1NK1R0> I eat when im hungry.
[2:41:17] <%bettysharkface> I know in cities it isn't possible
[2:41:24] <+zee_generate> It's really easy.
[2:41:25] <+justianxix> everyone does
[2:41:30] <+twohitgood> no, they deserve it. i live here...they definitely deserve it.
[2:41:30] <+Punishedkaiger> Californians deserve it
[2:41:31] <Commissar_Cornflakes> Californians wouldn't get picked on if they didn't deserve it
[2:41:37] <+Xalgar> My family went Vegan for my dad's dietary reasons and my sister INSTANTLY became the holier than though California stereotype
[2:41:41] <Mr_Strut> FUCK CALIFORNIA
[2:41:51] <ahaegotrigger> I mean youre mostly making fun of coastal big city Californians
[2:42:02] <RiverBirch> like a meat shield?
[2:42:05] <ComfyFox> holding in smashing into someone else
[2:42:12] <powerlessimp0> It’s a strange place to be sure, but I’d like to move back there
[2:42:14] <peachteagaming> masturbate the imp
[2:42:16] <Commissar_Cornflakes> Use it as a meatshield?
[2:42:23] <%JailShmixRemix> Jeez plague
[2:42:25] <CaptainFrankincense> punching should do more damage
[2:42:30] <Commissar_Cornflakes> That's actually a thing in some Brutal Doom permutations, lol.
[2:42:31] <%bettysharkface> I used to be friends with a whole bunch of vegans, I never made fun of them, I was always respectful, but ultimately because I wouldn't also take on their ideals, I got basically tossed to the curb.
[2:42:33] <TyrantSlime> That's a little darker than using it as a shield
[2:42:37] <+SH1NK1R0> That would be cool actually
[2:42:46] <%bettysharkface> You can't really be friends with activists I've learned
[2:42:46] <peachteagaming> brutal doom
[2:42:50] <peachteagaming> ?
[2:42:58] <+SH1NK1R0> Mod
[2:42:59] <lucidcalyx> Plague loves to kill
[2:43:06] <+twohitgood> the big yellow eyes on the undead guys makes them look constantly confused.
[2:43:06] <sniffy77> the game punishes you for staying still
[2:43:10] <+justianxix> slapping speed
[2:43:23] <+Punishedkaiger> UAC is cartoon evil
[2:43:25] <Commissar_Cornflakes> and an ugly chipmunk face
[2:43:25] <sniffy77> it expects you to jump and dash constantly around the battlefield
[2:43:30] <+wizard_of_diamonds> Unless it's a man bun Kappa
[2:43:32] <%bettysharkface> But you might be!
[2:43:33] <ahaegotrigger> LUL
[2:43:34] <LunarRemix> PS3 hair
[2:43:36] <cap_bon> demons going at you like the got a half life crowbar
[2:43:43] <$daveronald> to stretch the wrinkles
[2:43:44] <Sundaysmiles01> I mean I know plenty of guys with that hairstyle who are cunts
[2:43:46] <+wizard_of_diamonds> LUL
[2:43:54] <+Xalgar> @sniffy77 And that style of gameplay feels AWFUL on a gamepad LUL
[2:43:54] <Commissar_Cornflakes> Ahahaha cap, that's great
[2:43:57] <peachteagaming> all evil people have buns
[2:43:58] <%bettysharkface> Having your hair put up very tightly, gives you a headache
[2:44:08] <%bettysharkface> So they're bitches due to headache
[2:44:08] <+twohitgood> loose = less uptight
[2:44:14] <$daveronald> the Opposite of jesus
[2:44:28] <+jetjagger222> @Xalgar it really does feel bad on ps4
[2:44:30] <+Strelok608> I hate pinkies in this fame
[2:44:32] <+Strelok608> game
[2:44:40] <+wizard_of_diamonds> Don't make fun of the Holy-challenged, Plague Kappa
[2:44:45] <+Oprender> what difficulty is this
[2:44:49] <%Rezca> oh boi, this is like dark souls randomized artorias again
[2:44:52] <cap_bon> easy
[2:45:20] <+twohitgood> the pulled back tight hair has big karen energy.
[2:45:25] <+Strelok608> I'm on ultra violence and the super shotty is strong as fuck
[2:45:28] <+Strelok608> what are you shootinh
[2:45:31] <sniffy77> imagine them more like tools
[2:45:48] <+NotSoAccurateNo1> but plague, all the difficulties have same health pools
[2:45:57] <+Strelok608> the ballista's line gun mod also shreds things
[2:46:07] <@Nightbot> Plague is a youtube animator and also streams at https://picarto.tv/Plague . Also: t-shirts! http://goo.gl/lze8QO
[2:46:21] <dfs_k> my experience was very different, i felt great
[2:46:39] <+Strelok608> I've felt unimaginably powerful the entire time I've played
[2:46:41] <+zee_generate> You don't feel like a "slayer"
[2:46:48] <+jetjagger222> the only letdown so far is the rocket launcher
[2:46:49] <+SnakeySnake_> pinkies weakspot is in his ass
[2:46:53] <Commissar_Cornflakes> Pinkies have armored fronts.
[2:46:54] <+Oprender> You have to shoot them in the back dude @plagueofgripes
[2:46:57] <+twohitgood> you're wasting ammo shooting them in the face.
[2:46:58] <RiverBirch> Pinkies are armored in the front.
[2:46:59] <Sundaysmiles01> Pinkie's have Damage resistance in the face
[2:47:00] <dfs_k> because you're hitting them in their strongest armored spot man
[2:47:02] <LixFury> 2 shorts in the tail kills it tho
[2:47:02] <Commissar_Cornflakes> So you don't wanna shoot them in the face.
[2:47:08] <+justianxix> In this game especially, they emphasis weaknesses
[2:47:21] <dfs_k> i have to assume it's because you aren't using the weapons to their strengths
[2:47:26] <+Xalgar> @PlagueOfGripes You should do a video about the power scaling in the Warcraft universe. Characters get so many off screen power ups it's insane LUL
[2:47:28] <+Oprender> Those guys have armor in the front @plagueofgripes
[2:47:39] <+Strelok608> the super shotty destroys mancubi in two point blank hits
[2:47:44] <+zaibatsu_member_333> @PlagueOfGripes Plague how do you feel about the platforming accomplishing a good terrain puzzle feels great to me how about you?
[2:47:45] <+twohitgood> you're supposed to dodge their charge and shoot them from behind.
[2:48:18] <peachteagaming> Satan bow!
[2:48:33] <+Strelok608> use the super shotty point blank
[2:48:37] <+Xalgar> That was GOOD
[2:48:37] <+Strelok608> it's a demon deleter
[2:48:38] <+jetjagger222> the chaingun and plasma here are great unlike 2016
[2:48:46] <peachteagaming> get angry!
[2:48:49] <+jetjagger222> even on UV chaingun obliterates hordes
[2:48:53] <Commissar_Cornflakes> Plasma gun ain't bad in 2016, just not top tier
[2:48:58] <+twohitgood> you like eye contact when killing?
[2:49:06] <+jetjagger222> its more used for the burst than the primary
[2:49:07] <Commissar_Cornflakes> but the chaingun was only good with the turret
[2:49:12] <Commissar_Cornflakes> Or I guess rich get richer
[2:49:20] <Sundaysmiles01> hell knights
[2:49:21] <+zee_generate> Hell Knights
[2:49:23] <+jetjagger222> the primary felt like a rapidfire version of the peashooter pistol
[2:49:47] <+Oprender> Complaining when he has the game on easy LUL
[2:49:48] <cap_bon> Im only watching and im still having a hard time enjoying the music with how frantic shit is
[2:50:11] <+wizard_of_diamonds> I don't get the logic behind how they rebooted the franchise. They want a fast paced shooter, but they want to stop every minute for a 2-5 second QT event
[2:50:23] <+Xalgar> This game's design direction reminds me so much of Dark Souls 2. People praised Dark Souls 1 for it's difficulty so they just put in more dumb bullshit that insta kills you LUL
[2:51:03] <Commissar_Cornflakes> DaS2 was way easier than 1. Only hard boss it had was difficult because it was OHKO with broken hitboxes and a huge HP pool.
[2:51:07] <+Strelok608> it's not dumb though, you have to learn how to play
[2:51:50] <+jetjagger222> its more demanding than 2016
[2:51:52] <+SH1NK1R0> He doesnt want to interact with any of the mechanics and isnt using weakpoints at all. Like i get that you may wanna play it your way but hitiing an enemy in armor plates then claiming it takes too many shots to die is odd
[2:52:00] <+Strelok608> dude, use the chainsaw
[2:52:03] <+jetjagger222> DkS2 felt plain off
[2:52:16] <+zaibatsu_member_333> I don't mind the speed of the game its that damn shoulder cannon on the left, I don't like things obscuring my peripherals
[2:52:27] <+Strelok608> super shotgun kills arachnotrons in 2 shots point blank
[2:52:40] <+jetjagger222> pretty much all the enemies are ugly cute
[2:52:46] <+jetjagger222> except for the whiplashes
[2:52:48] <+jetjagger222> fuck those things
[2:53:11] <%Rezca> in both meanings
[2:53:25] <RiverBirch> I just wish the punch did more damage
[2:53:29] <CaptainFrankincense> if u blood punch them all the armour comes off (good luck with that on nightmare)
[2:53:34] <RiverBirch> it just feels like a shitty cardboard thwack
[2:53:41] <%Samex_Comex> Plucky duck
[2:53:41] <Bacon_Rage> nope
[2:53:42] <Commissar_Cornflakes> Yeah
[2:53:43] <+jetjagger222> its more of a shove
[2:53:43] <transporterthesequel> Eli go down the HOOOOOLE
[2:53:43] <+justianxix> what?
[2:53:44] <+twohitgood> plucky duck
[2:53:45] <+jetjagger222> than a punch
[2:53:53] <transporterthesequel> Tiny toons right?
[2:53:54] <+fingalights> Yep, Tiny Toons?
[2:54:00] <%Samex_Comex> All the kids where saying that back in school
[2:54:20] <+wizard_of_diamonds> Where you belong, Plague Kappa
[2:54:36] <%Samex_Comex> Ew Plague juice
[2:54:52] <Commissar_Cornflakes> Ivan Ooze's ooze
[2:55:06] <+wizard_of_diamonds> @Commissar_Cornflakes Good show, lad
[2:55:15] <+zee_generate> Yes a game about mobility, let's counter act that.
[2:55:28] <Commissar_Cornflakes> Tiny Toons was really great.
[2:55:34] <Commissar_Cornflakes> Besides Elmira
[2:55:35] <+twohitgood> it's the cadence of how it's said
[2:55:39] <+fingalights> I remember so many of my friends loved that line
[2:55:40] <+twohitgood> down the hoooolllee
[2:55:47] <Huntercd> Babs bunny looked great in a skirt
[2:55:50] <ComfyFox> Parkour!
[2:55:56] <+wizard_of_diamonds> What the hell
[2:56:01] <%Rezca> I believe this is where you came from
[2:56:01] <+twohitgood> wrong way
[2:56:06] <+wizard_of_diamonds> Whats with the wall mounted sewer cannons?
[2:56:09] <+SH1NK1R0> Its the wrong way
[2:56:16] <peachteagaming> left
[2:56:17] <Commissar_Cornflakes> don't think about it morty
[2:56:18] <+jetjagger222> @wizard_of_diamonds VIDYA GAMES
[2:56:31] <CaptainFrankincense> the purple slime is one of my complaints
[2:56:38] <Huntercd> Hell has a sewer system?
[2:56:58] <+fingalights> They are Demons, not animals
[2:57:00] <+jetjagger222> the problem is that the whole VIDEO GAMES shtick is that its incongruent with 2016, which at least had a semblance of realism
[2:57:13] <+jetjagger222> then again this should be treated as its own thing
[2:57:57] <+justianxix> I actually really prefer how video gamey this one is compared to 2016
[2:58:00] <Fenlig> Have you ever been in a sewer, how do you know they don't have those :D
[2:58:19] <+twohitgood> like sending bottle rockets down the street
[2:58:29] <CaptainFrankincense> yeah i didnt like 2016
[2:58:37] <+wizard_of_diamonds> LUL he explodes after having his eye ripped out
[2:58:52] <Fenlig> opened door back the way
[2:58:54] <cap_bon> you used all your shotgun ammo having fun now you dont have ammo left for the idiot bubble
[2:59:04] <Huntercd> So did the UAC fuck up more shit?
[2:59:13] <%Samex_Comex> I wonder if health pick ups taste good?
[2:59:14] <Commissar_Cornflakes> yes
[2:59:17] <Commissar_Cornflakes> yes they did
[2:59:17] <+zee_generate> music is good at least
[3:00:00] <Commissar_Cornflakes> Hey, crashed Apache.
[3:00:10] <transporterthesequel> Way more of a videogame is good, but way more front facing bad story, is bad
[3:00:17] <+wizard_of_diamonds> Man, thank goodness we had that cutscene. That was a good use of our time
[3:00:22] <LixFury> This isnt Doom (2016) 2, its Doom 2 (2020)
[3:00:25] <transporterthesequel> Background bad story is good, I liked that
[3:00:52] <Huntercd> In what universe is fucking with hell a good thing?
[3:01:15] <cap_bon> any universe you can fuck the demons
[3:01:20] <+zee_generate> @LixFury thats a good way to put it
[3:01:22] <ComfyFox> wow, not intimidating at all with the freeze
[3:01:23] <ComfyFox> wtf
[3:01:24] <+justianxix> I really like the lore, and it isn't "really" forced on you. Otherwise the story is just SAVE EARTH
[3:01:42] <+UnwoundCaesar70> @cap_bon in H-DOOM you can
[3:01:57] <+twohitgood> this is doom 3
[3:02:14] <+twohitgood> the consoles in the area are like doom 3's design.
[3:02:41] <Kraahka> Yeah all the lore is pretty interesting in 2016, and it's all just tucked away optionally throughout levels as you explore.
[3:02:50] <+twohitgood> the shield fuckers are horrible but also great. their horrible shit eating grin fits for how annoying they are.
[3:02:59] <%Samex_Comex> Tatzelwurms thats what the snake guys remind me of
[3:03:18] <shevan123> ITS THE BAD ONE
[3:03:26] <CyberDingus> THE THIRST IS BACK
[3:03:30] <Commissar_Cornflakes> Oh no, the masturbator
[3:03:37] <Huntercd> Where is Slaanesh?
[3:03:49] <CyberDingus> this IS Slaanesh
[3:03:54] <+justianxix> Getting thirstier and crazier by the second
[3:04:03] <chowdah101> It's like shes rubbing one out as shes singing his praises
[3:04:06] <+fingalights> This Kingdom Hearts?
[3:04:08] <+pheblorganzardo> look out, it's doctor damp chair
[3:04:12] <Huntercd> Where are the futa daemons then?
[3:04:17] <Commissar_Cornflakes> It really does sound like she's masturbating.
[3:04:19] <GOOPAHIPHOP> ew lol
[3:04:20] <transporterthesequel> This is not safe for Twitch
[3:04:20] <LunarRemix> Not Australia
[3:04:24] <ComfyFox> Kreygasm Kreygasm Kreygasm
[3:04:32] <Huntercd> splooshed
[3:04:33] <CyberDingus> >'she is doom'
[3:04:34] <shevan123> theyre not grat are they
[3:04:37] <CyberDingus> eh, lazy writting.
[3:04:40] <$Captain_Krunk> She disgusts me
[3:04:45] <CyberDingus> Expected her to say 'daddy' or something
[3:04:45] <LixFury> Iike that on the invasion map Australia is completly un touched LUL
[3:04:48] <%Rezca> I miss the deep demon voice rock
[3:04:55] <RiverBirch> also Madagascar
[3:04:55] <+justianxix> I like how she is getting crazier
[3:04:56] <+Punishedkaiger> The more lore they include, the worse the lore get
[3:04:59] <Commissar_Cornflakes> Australia is already hell.
[3:05:03] <+jetjagger222> the dr. claw voice from 2016 was great
[3:05:06] <LunarRemix> He is Doom.....64
[3:05:13] <RiverBirch> He is
[3:05:14] <RiverBirch> Doom 3
[3:05:16] <RiverBirch> Oh wait, SHIt
[3:05:24] <LunarRemix> Wait what?
[3:05:27] <LunarRemix> We don't talk about that
[3:05:29] <+jetjagger222> they look like plaguebearers
[3:05:42] <Commissar_Cornflakes> Like I can't figure out if Doctor Simp is SUPPOSED to sound like a pathetic crazy or if the devs thought that was cool.
[3:05:45] <+jetjagger222> except fleshy and with cyborg bits
[3:06:01] <RiverBirch> Fucking ghost paladins
[3:06:04] <RiverBirch> stealing my dinner plates
[3:06:10] <Huntercd> that is a big ass quarter
[3:06:12] <+jetjagger222> LUL
[3:06:14] <+zee_generate> Why is he giving you a really big quarter.
[3:06:17] <%Rezca> a lot
[3:06:19] <CyberDingus> The devs figured that modern day women would get insta-wet from seeing a man being a man.
[3:06:20] <CaptainFrankincense> lots
[3:06:25] <transporterthesequel> You're about 35% of the way in
[3:06:31] <ComfyFox> still in tutorial
[3:06:35] <+justianxix> I think this is barely almost 50%
[3:07:23] <Sundaysmiles01> well, if you dont enjoy playing it, play something that makes you happy and bonerific
[3:07:39] <RiverBirch> *pulls at collar @ the end of this level*
[3:07:46] <+jetjagger222> this was the level i started to like it
[3:07:53] <+zee_generate> Quad damage power up all the time.
[3:07:56] <Sundaysmiles01> he's trying
[3:08:00] <+Oprender> So what you want is the game to be more easy? WeirdChamp
[3:08:12] <%kyh9> jump and dash?
[3:08:16] <$Captain_Krunk> Wtf is this slow motion goo?
[3:08:19] <cap_bon> for a brief moment you got to feel the fun of shooting a real gun at demons
[3:08:21] <peachteagaming> do people still listen to heavy metal on earth after the demon invasion?
[3:08:25] <CyberDingus> Here she cooms!
[3:08:32] <Kraahka> Stop listening to it then
[3:08:35] <Sundaysmiles01> I would peach
[3:08:42] <Commissar_Cornflakes> God damn this lady NEVER stops masturbating
[3:08:51] <+jetjagger222> huhhhhh
[3:08:59] <+justianxix> She converted
[3:08:59] <CyberDingus> 'DOOM'
[3:09:00] <CyberDingus> uh
[3:09:02] <$Captain_Krunk> I wish she would stop saying that
[3:09:04] <GOOPAHIPHOP> its like she reading her weird fanfic XD
[3:09:06] <peachteagaming> God damn I NEVER stops masturbating
[3:09:07] <Yummy_Nukes> i mean, who wouldn't coom to doomguy?
[3:09:08] <Huntercd> She wants that dick
[3:09:09] <Commissar_Cornflakes> the spear, eh
[3:09:10] <Sundaysmiles01> THE DOOMTHIRSTER
[3:09:12] <CyberDingus> >dominant
[3:09:13] <$Captain_Krunk> STOP
[3:09:14] <CyberDingus> huehuehuehue
[3:09:19] <+pheblorganzardo> she wants his spear to stab at the heart of her
[3:09:20] <ComfyFox> THE DOOM SQUIRTER
[3:09:20] <cap_bon> The Doom Thot
[3:09:21] <Commissar_Cornflakes> holy shit
[3:09:25] <Commissar_Cornflakes> hoooooooooooooooooly shit
[3:09:26] <+wizard_of_diamonds> That feel when you didn't preorder Doom Eternal LUL
[3:09:26] <transporterthesequel> What is the POINT OF THESE THINGSD
[3:09:35] <LunarRemix> She wants him to stab her cunt.
[3:09:38] <+jetjagger222> demon voice
[3:09:41] <Commissar_Cornflakes> She's gonna say 'daddy' in the next one, betting on it
[3:09:42] <BonemanJohn> It was cooler n 2016
[3:09:42] <Huntercd> She wants his 'sword'
[3:09:43] <CyberDingus> Dr Elena wants to be DOOMED
[3:09:48] <Fenlig> Yeah they were sweet!
[3:09:49] <Sundaysmiles01> DOOMDADDY
[3:10:05] <peachteagaming> the doom slayer has body insecurities!
[3:10:06] <Yummy_Nukes> the demons coom when doomguy breaks their bones
[3:10:07] <ahaegotrigger> yeah Doom Daddy was much better
[3:10:07] <Sundaysmiles01> its mastubatory
[3:10:12] <+zee_generate> Being impressed vs. gushing
[3:10:13] <Commissar_Cornflakes> Repeating it in this one doesn't work either because Doom 2016 already did it
[3:10:26] <Commissar_Cornflakes> and the idea that the demons were afraid of him was new and amusing
[3:10:27] <$Captain_Krunk> She be gushing girl juices all over like a Duke Nukem fan girl
[3:10:34] <+wizard_of_diamonds> Games that talk about how a god the PC is are fucking pathetic
[3:10:37] <CyberDingus> Eli, don't blame her for wanting his shotgun down her thirsty throat.
[3:10:42] <%Rezca> ok, this is what I wanted to hear today
[3:10:45] <%Samex_Comex> Get this girl a bucket!
[3:10:47] <CyberDingus> She and that Demonic Voice have it hard
[3:10:48] <+justianxix> They are creating a cult for doomguy
[3:10:56] <transporterthesequel> Big ole boss fountain
[3:11:00] <ComfyFox> Subscribe to my OnlyDoom, 20% off for new Members
[3:11:02] <ahaegotrigger> she just blasts off like mario in super mario sunshine
[3:11:04] <Commissar_Cornflakes> Wait, Eli - plot twist. The UAC announcement girl you hate and Doctor Damp-Pants are the same woman.
[3:11:05] <peachteagaming> she can mop the floor
[3:11:07] <+jetjagger222> here we go boys
[3:11:09] <Sundaysmiles01> Its almost like sex chat lines
[3:11:15] <ahaegotrigger> water jetting from place to place
[3:11:20] <%Samex_Comex> What the fuck humans!?
[3:11:20] <ComfyFox> Wait, Humans?
[3:11:21] <Sundaysmiles01> nope
[3:11:25] <SadisticAphid60> Imagine the smell
[3:11:31] <+wizard_of_diamonds> That design is hilarious
[3:11:32] <+pheblorganzardo> the doomguy is a mega death super god narrative really doesnt jive with him using mundane weapons lol
[3:11:34] <%kyh9> It feels like a similar situation of Wolfenstein New Order vs New Colossus
[3:11:40] <Ether101_Prime> Ate plot devices.
[3:11:40] <SadisticAphid60> lmao
[3:11:41] <Sundaysmiles01> NERRRRRD
[3:11:44] <CyberDingus> move away, simp boy.
[3:11:53] <SadisticAphid60> Is doom guy like 7 feet tall
[3:11:53] <+jetjagger222> TNC was worse
[3:12:07] <ComfyFox> i dont like how your First Person Cam is just floating instead of stompy heavy movement...
[3:12:17] <+jetjagger222> here we go
[3:12:18] <%kyh9> wake the fuck up hayden
[3:12:18] <+wizard_of_diamonds> LUL

[3:12:20] <SadisticAphid60> ITS HIM
[3:12:24] <CrowsSanctuary> Plague i feel you i am playing doom 2016 i got a most of the weapon points and upgrades. Then i am done with colecting
[3:12:24] <%kyh9> viril
[3:12:28] <%kyh9> its virgil
[3:12:31] <%Rezca> oh boi, hope you love parrying
[3:12:34] <Ether101_Prime> Doomguy's too tall it makes all the devices around to big for normal humans to use.
[3:12:35] <Commissar_Cornflakes> the virgin marauder
[3:12:36] <$doomp12> the worst enemy is here
[3:12:43] <LunarRemix> Mood demon?
[3:12:45] <LunarRemix> vs Doom Guy
[3:12:54] <cap_bon> The pursuer?
[3:13:04] <Ether101_Prime> The Betrayer is the the dude with the robotic arm.
[3:13:09] <Sundaysmiles01> he's a mini boss
[3:13:11] <CyberDingus> please no-one tell dr Elena about this fight
[3:13:12] <+KityLinn> god these tutorials..
[3:13:21] <Ether101_Prime> He's both a boss and a unit.
[3:13:21] <CyberDingus> she will write terrible shcil-fictions
[3:13:23] <CyberDingus> BOOKS OF THEM
[3:13:23] <$Captain_Krunk> Whoa, this is something
[3:13:25] <ComfyFox> wow what, it actually explains you how to kill that fuck
[3:13:25] <SadisticAphid60> hes supposed to be demon doom guy
[3:13:27] <ComfyFox> geez
[3:13:29] <Sundaysmiles01> yep shoot his as
[3:13:29] <BonemanJohn> PogChamp PARRY
[3:13:31] <Yummy_Nukes> video game!
[3:13:32] <%kyh9> It's kind of stupid that they don't think the player can figure this stuff out
[3:13:34] <Sundaysmiles01> Chaingun is good for that
[3:13:35] <transporterthesequel> It is
[3:13:35] <Commissar_Cornflakes> You know, it's a bit weird that the Marauder actually got REWARDED by hell as opposed to Doctor Scoliosis in Doom 2016 who got immediately betrayed.
[3:13:35] <+justianxix> Bloodborne
[3:13:39] <+fingalights> Yeah
[3:13:41] <jiin6> Parry this
[3:13:42] <$Captain_Krunk> Agreed
[3:13:44] <Ether101_Prime> Only lost to this one twice.
[3:13:56] <+justianxix> vergil baby
[3:13:57] <+arancet> yeah... gotta sekiro this
[3:14:02] <CaptainFrankincense> this guy on nightmare is very annoying
[3:14:05] <Kraahka> You're not gonna have fun with this on a controller
[3:14:18] <+KityLinn> TableHere
[3:14:19] <+SASMARV> this is what ends your game here
[3:14:22] <+jetjagger222> explosives will work
[3:14:28] <+jetjagger222> as long as they're behind
[3:14:45] <SadisticAphid60> oh god the dogs
[3:14:45] <%caramello_man> he doesnt have a health bar
[3:14:58] <+arancet> blood punch wrecks him pretty hard though
[3:15:03] <+justianxix> doing pretty well though
[3:15:05] <+jetjagger222> wow that was fast
[3:15:05] <ahaegotrigger> sic
[3:15:05] <Sundaysmiles01> gg
[3:15:06] <+wizard_of_diamonds> LUL
[3:15:07] <%caramello_man> wow what a scrub
[3:15:10] <+KityLinn> zgbGG
[3:15:19] <+wizard_of_diamonds> Amazing
[3:15:20] <%Samex_Comex> Oh
[3:15:20] <%Rezca> huh, I guess that should be the gun to use on him
[3:15:22] <Sundaysmiles01> on easy difficulty
[3:15:27] <i_am_therydon> that was a bad boss fight.
[3:15:27] <Yummy_Nukes> its you but eviler
[3:15:30] <Ether101_Prime> That was a Vergil.
[3:15:37] <LunarRemix> He sucks
[3:15:44] <+jetjagger222> the doom hunters were more fun
[3:15:48] <Sundaysmiles01> oh yeah, he's not a villain, more of a mini boss
[3:16:03] <CrowsSanctuary> Oh no he going to talk about the farm again
[3:16:05] <transporterthesequel> See, isn't that a problem?
[3:16:14] <transporterthesequel> SHOULDN'T he be a villian?
[3:16:15] <CaptainFrankincense> nah on harder diffs its just more annoying
[3:16:18] <SadisticAphid60> Call of Doom
[3:16:25] <peachteagaming> sleepy plague is cute
[3:16:31] <transporterthesequel> You would think "Evil Doomguy" would be a bigger deal
[3:16:32] <Sundaysmiles01> nah
[3:16:37] <+jetjagger222> NOPE
[3:16:41] <+jetjagger222> that's not video games
[3:16:42] <%kyh9> It is, those guys are mass-manufactured I think
[3:16:42] <ComfyFox> Kagebunshin Vergil
[3:16:43] <$Captain_Krunk> No, you don't expect to see a Vergil equal you
[3:16:46] <i_am_therydon> he didnt even have an awesome death animation.
[3:16:49] <Commissar_Cornflakes> If Hell could make a counter to Doom Guy they'd have done it by now.
[3:16:55] <+zee_generate> Oh there's cheat codes?
[3:17:15] <Sundaysmiles01> yep
[3:17:23] <Commissar_Cornflakes> Oh sure
[3:17:24] <Sundaysmiles01> gotta complete a level before you can use them
[3:17:30] <%Rezca> How does he know this
[3:17:31] <Commissar_Cornflakes> put Hayden in charge of your ship's computer
[3:17:34] <Sundaysmiles01> BFG TIME
[3:17:35] <%Rezca> is what I want to know
[3:17:38] <Commissar_Cornflakes> that guy who betrayed you last time
[3:17:39] <SadisticAphid60> I like Hayden
[3:17:48] <Commissar_Cornflakes> because he had more confidence in his intelligence than your experience
[3:18:01] <+zee_generate> Is this the adeptus mechanicus?
[3:18:04] <CaptainFrankincense> i guess lost as in fucked
[3:18:11] <Huntercd> didnt hayden start this whole demon bullshit?
[3:18:16] <+justianxix> He understands LUL
[3:18:22] <ComfyFox> Doomguy "hold my bear"
[3:18:22] <Commissar_Cornflakes> Yes we can.
[3:18:26] <Sundaysmiles01> prolly updated the filter
[3:18:28] <ComfyFox> *beer
[3:18:31] <+jetjagger222> huhhh
[3:18:32] <LixFury> I mean he is a boat now
[3:18:38] <+wizard_of_diamonds> Would Hayden be the guy to name something the BFG 10000?
[3:18:42] <LittleBigQuebec> Objective "shoot a hole in mars"
[3:18:48] <cap_bon> oh is this the bit that was in all the trailers kinda takes the wind out of the sales a little
[3:18:52] <Commissar_Cornflakes> They'd know because there were people there, Eli
[3:18:52] <SadisticAphid60> all according to keikaku
[3:18:56] <Commissar_Cornflakes> people who left
[3:19:08] <Sundaysmiles01> whatcha planning on playing next Plague?
[3:19:15] <+fingalights> Different three letter org
[3:19:19] <+justianxix> Well, the ARC and the UAC are different factions
[3:19:21] <LittleBigQuebec> the ARC are the good humans left to fight the demans
[3:19:25] <%Samex_Comex> What was that DOS shit?
[3:19:51] <+PleaseStayLucid> in game console
[3:19:51] <+justianxix> preferences for different people
[3:20:08] <+SH1NK1R0> So the funny thing is. Hayden betrays us because wedont listen to him and destroy all the argent shit.He kept saying "dont do that we are gonna need it" then he takes the sword to use it to remake argent and arm the resistance
[3:20:10] <+Oprender> Well they are more useful on other difficulties other than easy....
[3:20:31] <+PleaseStayLucid> ^^^
[3:20:39] <CaptainFrankincense> i picked air movement
[3:20:58] <$Captain_Krunk> Are there any games with light RPG mechanics that are good?
[3:21:07] <+NotSoAccurateNo1> plague, upgrade your gun mods
[3:21:18] <$Captain_Krunk> or levels mechanics
[3:21:26] <+wizard_of_diamonds> @Captain_Krunk Nope, AAA ran it straight into the ground
[3:22:26] <IsaacClarkeANCAP> Just reload the tutorial level for ez wins.
[3:22:34] <$daveronald> Whats your next game if you stop Doom?
[3:22:57] <IsaacClarkeANCAP> Doom 2.
[3:23:10] <peachteagaming> plague's yawns are cute
[3:23:14] <+zee_generate> I wanted to preorder this game, but it didnt seem worth 60 bucks
[3:23:17] <SadisticAphid60> OH MY GORSH IT THE DOOM GUY
[3:23:21] <SadisticAphid60> jesus christ
[3:23:25] <+justianxix> pretty much
[3:23:44] <cap_bon> this is alot less impressive after listening to taht scientist lady sploosh everywhere
[3:23:54] <SadisticAphid60> my gun now
[3:23:57] <Commissar_Cornflakes> this is the second time you've advocated for uncontrollable farting
[3:24:08] <SadisticAphid60> Did people treat Master Chief like this?
[3:24:12] <valentinostand> waw I didn't know Plague had a Twitch Channel thought it was just that Art Streaming
[3:24:12] <SadisticAphid60> I don't think they did
[3:24:13] <Sundaysmiles01> like he immediately just spreads his cheeks and lifts his sac
[3:24:23] <The_Neko_Otaku> what is that gun shooting at really
[3:24:30] <%JailShmixRemix> Plague has always been an advocate of farting
[3:24:44] <+zee_generate> I thought we hated sam?
[3:24:46] <peachteagaming> comidy
[3:24:47] <%Rezca> levels feel rearranged
[3:24:48] <Sundaysmiles01> a holdover from the trailer
[3:24:50] <bamboosprout> no
[3:24:54] <LittleBigQuebec> because theUAC knows you blow shit up in Doom 2016
[3:24:57] <$doomp12> bigger fill size
[3:25:03] <$doomp12> clip
[3:25:13] <Huntercd> not demons apparently @the_neko_otaku
[3:25:14] <ComfyFox> "This is the Doomslayer speaking and this is my Favorite Store on Mars."
[3:25:18] <%caramello_man> dont
[3:25:23] <$daveronald> whatever you want
[3:25:25] <Bacon_Rage> meh
[3:25:27] <+KityLinn> Plague saltyness is what i'm here for
[3:25:30] <SadisticAphid60> its silly
[3:25:30] <transporterthesequel> It's gonna go downhill a bit
[3:25:30] <Commissar_Cornflakes> watching you suffer is pretty amusing
[3:25:31] <+justianxix> Well if you are not enjoying it
[3:25:32] <ahaegotrigger> im fine for you complaining about it
[3:25:32] <LixFury> I really enjoy it
[3:25:35] <+wizard_of_diamonds> Pretty boring
[3:25:37] <Maids4lyfe> I like it
[3:25:40] <i_am_therydon> doom 2016 was 10/10 this is 8/10
[3:25:41] <LixFury> But i get why people dont like it
[3:25:41] <%JailShmixRemix> The music is nice atleast
[3:25:44] <LunarRemix> I enjoy your comentary more than anything
[3:25:44] <Commissar_Cornflakes> Positives, I guess - lots of enemy variety, great soundtrack
[3:25:44] <%Rezca> Enjoyed it, but mainly playing it myself. Story needs rework
[3:25:45] <peachteagaming> rub plagues beard!
[3:25:46] <$daveronald> I'm personally not a fan
[3:25:47] <+KityLinn> it took a direction that I don't enjoy
[3:25:50] <+UnwoundCaesar70> I think it's really good and better than 2016
[3:25:51] <transporterthesequel> Me, they learned the wrong story lessons from 2016
[3:25:51] <ahaegotrigger> I had fun its a fun metal music power fantasy
[3:25:52] <LunarRemix> Seems like a slog tbh.
[3:25:52] <+Oprender> It's a good game you just want things to be easier for yourself is what sounds like
[3:25:53] <+zee_generate> Glad I didn't buy it now.
[3:25:55] <cap_bon> it looks more fun to watch than play
[3:25:56] <@Nightbot> Plague is a youtube animator and also streams at https://picarto.tv/Plague . Also: t-shirts! http://goo.gl/lze8QO
[3:25:56] <+justianxix> I really liked it, I like the lore and the gameplay
[3:25:58] <GOOPAHIPHOP> could be mindless fun
[3:25:58] <LunarRemix> Nothing interesting
[3:25:59] <Fenlig> I loved the intensity. I get the complains about the more arcade feel to the 2016 version though
[3:25:59] <Sundaysmiles01> honestly? I like the learning curve because I like to be challenged and adapt to the elements, but the story is dogshit
[3:25:59] <CaptainFrankincense> i had fun i liked it more than 2016
[3:26:03] <LixFury> Its abit much for 2016 fans
[3:26:11] <ahaegotrigger> although this story is comical
[3:26:18] <ahaegotrigger> yes
[3:26:22] <Sundaysmiles01> if you don't like it, play what you like, its why we play games
[3:26:23] <$daveronald> not a lot of variation
[3:26:27] <Commissar_Cornflakes> Negatives - worse take on the ammo system, too much fucking platforming, the farce is TOO farcical
[3:26:32] <%JailShmixRemix> I wanted more metal honestly
[3:26:39] <peachteagaming> zone is on.
[3:26:42] <+jetjagger222> he's marking out
[3:26:43] <transporterthesequel> Like, Doomguy respects the story in this game. I liked him not actually giving a shit, and ME giving a shit.
[3:26:44] <+justianxix> I want to see that too
[3:26:48] <GarrisonWaifu> bitterSmug Nic was rather fond of it
[3:26:50] <CursedNobleman> how do i do combo?! LUL
[3:26:55] <+justianxix> Should be interesting
[3:26:58] <Sundaysmiles01> I been watching woolie play Black Mesa and he better not play it on controller, because he SUCKS on controler...
[3:27:01] <Commissar_Cornflakes> Plague, is that on Twitch or Youtube?
[3:27:08] <%Samex_Comex> Zone never sleeps
