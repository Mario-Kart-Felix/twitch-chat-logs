[0:11:13] <cap_bon> principals have low monetary returns

[0:11:39] <+sonofthedeepsouth> Grifting brings a lot of money. Just look at youtube political commentators
[0:12:13] <%Bluwizard21> Bluwizard21 subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 2 months! Wow that notification took forever
[0:12:26] <bippityjones> @sonofthedeepsouth Yeah get into that selling water filters scam, say it makes you a furry or something
[0:12:37] <waviline> Sounds like a scene transition jingle
[0:12:37] <%PleasantLee> you've got 12 videos over 1 million views, that should be worth something
[0:13:06] <+sonofthedeepsouth> the cringeness makes it worth every cent
[0:13:07] <cap_bon> I tried doing commisons but art became alot less fun when its not your shit your doing :(
[0:13:10] <TwoStarPlayersNik> You should have done what I did and churn out Warframe videos, that community watches EVERYTHING
[0:13:18] <+Mekhet09> Speaking of cringe when is Danganrompa going to finish? I'm waiting on baited breath.
[0:13:27] <TwoStarPlayersNik> I'm a very small channel, and I'm at the "couple of hundred bucks a month"
[0:13:43] <TheAntiNihilist> if you don't care about principles then why not make doujins?
[0:13:53] <waviline> Mew-vee thyme

[0:15:16] <%Bigchill___> Plague time
[0:15:35] <+ninja_galt> oi oi oi
[0:15:59] <%Bigchill___> @PlagueOfGripes I like the add of the monitor in front of your kitty so it looks like you are working on something.
[0:16:01] <waviline> He always looks like a final boss Villain. It's wonderful.
[0:16:25] <%PleasantLee> its always better to lie in bed with your eyes closed and not get up if you cant sleep
[0:16:35] <vonpimpenstein> the monitor looks good
[0:16:48] <+ninja_galt> demonic possession
[0:17:30] <cap_bon> I hadnt even noticed you switched from Sai to Clip Studio
[0:17:49] <%Samex_Comex> Now you just need a giant meaty paw that appears on the screen when you draw
[0:18:02] <vonpimpenstein> aww the cute cat did a hickup
[0:18:13] <%PleasantLee> or a nipple holding a knife
[0:18:13] <TwoStarPlayersNik> "The threat of a nipple"
[0:18:15] <waviline> Nipple Threat: Low
[0:18:17] <cap_bon> Full frontal male nudity
[0:18:20] <ayb_hl> ! nipple warning !
[0:18:32] <stephenpee> a nipple is never a threat
[0:18:46] <waviline> Depends on the nipple
[0:18:52] <+realm_forge> There are few things as threatening as a nipple
[0:18:55] <%PleasantLee> if you want to know if a movie has nudity in it, google image search it, it will always be high the list
[0:18:57] <TwoStarPlayersNik> A third nipple can seem threatening
[0:19:01] <ayb_hl> lofi as heck
[0:19:07] <JoshManVGH> That nipple... it's got a gun!
[0:19:17] <waviline> Warble horns! Hell yeah!
[0:19:29] <cap_bon> I still miss the picarto TNG :(
[0:19:36] <%Samex_Comex> Sleep N' eat
[0:19:42] <+realm_forge> Back when speakers were exclusively made out of cotton balls
[0:19:46] <DANsehbaricl> "I have stood before myself, reflected in the cracking mirror of my own life. What forms are these that swim in my dreams? What shadows cast by the lonely temples? As I lay dying on the stone steps, all I saw was a great serpent wound around the pistons and pumps, wounded by the crush of the wheels. To unlock the passion, the coming century. Must we be crushed underfoot by metal feet not mine?" Cheer100
[0:20:00] <TwoStarPlayersNik> a stray gussy
[0:20:03] <waviline> Cotton balls and busted pipes
[0:20:19] <DANsehbaricl> It's from Amnesia A Machine for Pigs.
[0:20:38] <%Samex_Comex> Oh man it's gussy time again
[0:20:39] <JoshManVGH> "What are we looking at Milton?"
[0:20:51] <DANsehbaricl> It's the best Amnesia; Hence everyone hating on it.
[0:20:59] <cap_bon> I tried playing the latest Amnesia and wuff
[0:21:06] <Redne22> what we watching
[0:21:13] <JoshManVGH> Whaaaat?
[0:21:15] <%PleasantLee> "theres a fucking chimp in there"
[0:21:20] <waviline> "More light flashing,damn it! I want that good lightning!"

[0:22:49] <%Puhff> monke
[0:22:51] <Jetsfantasy> Monke is PISSED
[0:22:51] <%silvery_cricket> Most likely the record they recorded his audio on got warped
[0:23:00] <JoshManVGH> Jesus that's loud!
[0:23:05] <%silvery_cricket> So during editing they just used what they had
[0:23:12] <DANsehbaricl> PogChamp Delicious Time.

[0:25:40] <waviline> The precursor to Dustin Checks In
[0:25:44] <%Puhff> saw some new dweeb on SNL has my same first and last name and it made me upset
[0:25:50] <+realm_forge> All he wants to do Is drink and smoke comically oversized cigars

[0:39:18] <Redne22> wow money

[0:39:53] <%Puhff> $50 in 1925 would be $781.62 today
[0:40:18] <%PleasantLee> on dialup it took me 7 days to pirate a 700mb file of the nightmare before christmas off of limewire
[0:40:20] <%Puhff> so not awful but he'd prolly still need a   t e job
[0:40:28] <%impulse255dj> Evening all arrySup

[0:43:54] <%silvery_cricket> I hope that black guy got credited for his role in the movie, black actors got snubbed alot in the credits back in the day.
[0:44:08] <lemon_lover28> is that why you watch black and white movies?
[0:44:12] <%PleasantLee> the trick is to just do greyscale
[0:44:47] <+sonofthedeepsouth> Its a race to who gets murdered first
[0:45:02] <+sonofthedeepsouth> The driver the lawyer or the crippled uncle
[0:45:18] <%silvery_cricket> there is always cross hatching, the art equivalent of smashing your balls with a hammer
[0:45:22] <%PleasantLee> most tattoo artists end up doing greyscale realism, for a good reason
[0:45:33] <JoshManVGH> She read the script

[0:53:50] <JoshManVGH> My money is that the tall guy has been tasked with killing the daughter. And for some reason this plan entrails hairing up his arm so... the presumably dead daughter can't id the person who killed her... yeah that sounds stupid enough

[0:54:13] <%silvery_cricket> Is that gonna be the twist

[1:36:22] <%silvery_cricket> Wouldn't he need to speak to his generals if they are going to war
[1:36:37] <Presence_Eternal> Wasn't the conflict in the book based on how to crack open hard boiled eggs?
[1:36:53] <%silvery_cricket> Also wouldnt the king of the other kingdom be a political prisoner
[1:37:00] <%Samex_Comex> I hope the kings get together in the end
[1:37:06] <%silvery_cricket> since why would the bad king ever let the gentle king leave

[1:44:25] <+lifeofnotorious> I'm sitting here eating grapes, mildly amused
[1:44:40] <Presence_Eternal> Plate tectonics.
[1:44:43] <%silvery_cricket> They were high on cocaine and drunk off gin back then, they had a different sense of humor

[1:48:07] <Presence_Eternal> Not one fart joke yet. I am both impressed and saddened.
[1:48:31] <+sonofthedeepsouth> okay that is a good joke
[1:48:51] <stranger59> He was actually super in distress, but that's just his voice.
[1:49:01] <@Nightbot> Plague is a youtube animator and also streams at https://picarto.tv/Plague . Also: t-shirts! http://goo.gl/lze8QO
[1:49:04] <Redne22> this guy is dead
[1:49:06] <+Mekhet09> He's a heavy sleeper.
[1:49:09] <Dunmarkh> It's night time
[1:49:15] <$SGrim> Also very heavily to not be woken by this shit.
[1:49:16] <Presence_Eternal> Giants are known for their laziness.
[1:49:33] <+sonofthedeepsouth> he must be exhauted because of the sinking of his ship
[1:49:40] <+Mekhet09> Well he wouldn't be breathing lol.
[1:49:44] <Dunmarkh> LUL
[1:49:56] <%sasparillatango> the rotting body poisons the wter source
[1:49:57] <Presence_Eternal> More than a few stories involve turning a giant's corpse into a mine.
[1:50:00] <+Mrbaconator> they get paul bunyun disease from dr mcninja
[1:50:01] <schuenator> Wattup plague! Hope you’re doing well you handsome hick.
[1:50:03] <TwoStarPlayersNik> he gets bloated and explodes like a beached whale
[1:50:06] <%PittCat> The smell alone from the corpse
[1:50:10] <Dunmarkh> Just shits out a tape worm kaiju
[1:50:12] <%moonsaber99> WOOOO
[1:50:16] <%Samex_Comex> But I heard him say woo
[1:50:29] <%sasparillatango> his miasma instills an unnatural hunger in the liliputians
[1:50:29] <JoshManVGH> Having been filled with hubris from killing one giant, the Lilliputians sail to war
[1:50:36] <%sasparillatango> they begin to crave flesh
[1:50:44] <+Mekhet09> Oh man, Plague you should read a graphic novel called petit if you want to read a french story about comics..
[1:51:13] <Kotokaname> all this for a man that is knocked out
[1:51:17] <+sonofthedeepsouth> They been able to do all this structures in a couple of hours?
[1:51:49] <Presence_Eternal> Possibly the speed of their work is inspired by dormorvoi/brownie/elf myths.
[1:52:06] <$SGrim> Yes
[1:52:09] <+Mekhet09> Wow.
[1:52:10] <+sonofthedeepsouth> Yes
[1:52:14] <%PittCat> Most likely
[1:52:15] <schuenator> Is it tough to draw convincing cartoon ropes?
[1:52:19] <+Mekhet09> That's the first place your mind goes to lol.
[1:52:20] <%Explodincatz> probly
[1:52:25] <Julkson> suddenly horses?
[1:52:29] <schuenator> Yes, if it’s fleischer
[1:52:39] <Presence_Eternal> Honestly that's why I never google the actors in old shows.
[1:52:45] <Redne22> lol
[1:52:46] <Presence_Eternal> Frankly I don't want to know.
[1:52:51] <schuenator> I live in the same town as the old fleischer studio. It’s a police station now
[1:52:55] <Daxalog> Yeah we just kinda go along with you for our own safety
[1:53:03] <%ralphwiggum16> Plague, are you the world's smartest man?
[1:53:03] <TheAsylumCat> on of them screams "Bring forth the giant red ball!"
[1:53:08] <+Mekhet09> Rip those horses.
[1:53:12] <Kotokaname> if man falls all them horses gone
[1:53:13] <+sonofthedeepsouth> I kean they had tiny birds
[1:53:14] <schuenator> But why preserve it when everyone who made it is dead?
[1:53:27] <yukichocomilk> I avoid yellow a lot too
[1:54:23] <+sonofthedeepsouth> Cant wait for the attack on titan moment
[1:54:24] <%moonsaber99> man this dude is a deep sleeper
[1:54:25] <%Explodincatz> jeez how long has this montage been
[1:54:26] <+Mrbaconator> green is not a creative color
[1:54:52] <TheAsylumCat> @moonsaber99 Partied pretty hard he must've
[1:54:56] <schuenator> And yet, we depend on yellow for our planet’s survibal
[1:55:12] <%PittCat> So does Superman
[1:55:21] <%silvery_cricket> Wow
[1:55:26] <%silvery_cricket> this movie kinda sucks
[1:55:30] <schuenator> True
[1:55:35] <Presence_Eternal> The sun isn't really yellow. Although NASA would have people believe otherwise.
[1:55:42] <%silvery_cricket> Thank goodness Gulliver doesnt have morning wood
[1:55:50] <$SGrim> @silvery_cricket public domain for a reason
[1:55:58] <Presence_Eternal> Kind of a strange non-conspiracy where everything gets done up in fake color.
[1:56:02] <schuenator> Dammit, I fell for another of nasa’s tricks.
[1:56:09] <TheAsylumCat> @silvery_cricket I would be ecstatic if he did
[1:56:11] <+sonofthedeepsouth> Bridge should have broken
[1:56:12] <+realm_forge> Gullible must have gotten shitfaced to be that out of it
[1:56:23] <+realm_forge> Gulliver
[1:56:26] <%silvery_cricket> @TheAsylumCat He would of destroyed the bridge if he had morning wood
[1:56:29] <%Explodincatz> why the fuck are u bringing him into town?!
[1:56:34] <%Samex_Comex> Damn they actually moved him
[1:56:38] <%PittCat> The wind resistance alone
[1:56:41] <JoshManVGH> Imagine starting a movie project and being like "Can we do a 20minute long protracted scene of tiny people moving an unconscious man?"
[1:56:41] <+sonofthedeepsouth> They are idiots
[1:56:43] <%lemoan> @realm_forge he been dead for 2 days
[1:56:47] <schuenator> Got to bring the meal to the fire
[1:56:52] <Kotokaname> it is a movie i guess
[1:57:07] <+realm_forge> LUL
[1:57:08] <TheAsylumCat> @silvery_cricket they would've mistaken it for a tower earlier
[1:57:11] <TwoStarPlayersNik> 80 minutes is a long time for only 20 lines of dialogue
[1:57:13] <+sonofthedeepsouth> People can just walk up and wake the king. Nice
[1:57:13] <schuenator> Imagine the parasites inside Gulliver are as big as the townsfolk
[1:57:35] <%silvery_cricket> Hope Gulliver doesn't have to take a shit
[1:57:40] <%silvery_cricket> they would never be able to clean it up
[1:58:04] <+Mrbaconator> he's also tied up in basically string
[1:58:05] <Kotokaname> they all drown or die from the smell
[1:58:05] <schuenator> No consorts in bed? Ain’t no king to me
[1:58:09] <%Samex_Comex> The streets flooded with cum
[1:58:09] <%PittCat> Talk about salting the Earth
[1:58:16] <%silvery_cricket> It be like that shitty episode of Rick and Morty
[1:58:20] <Kaji04> the clap of his cheeks will deafen the entire realm
[1:58:22] <%SoFarFetched> oh shit we got gullivers travel
[1:58:22] <%silvery_cricket> where they gotta fight Gulliver's sperm
[1:58:23] <+realm_forge> That came up in the original book
[1:58:28] <schuenator> But you could make a sword out of gulliver’s toenails
[1:58:41] <Redne22> hes totally dead
[1:58:44] <%SoFarFetched> I mainly remembered this for its rotoscoping
[1:58:50] <Kotokaname> a quick pray
[1:58:53] <%silvery_cricket> Like if Gulliver has a wet dream you basically are fighting giant anacondas
[1:58:58] <+sonofthedeepsouth> Whimsy as fuck
[1:59:06] <%silvery_cricket> The sperm would just be that big
[1:59:08] <alroy900> can this fucker wake up already
[1:59:11] <+sonofthedeepsouth> Where is the tatakae
[1:59:14] <schuenator> I remembered there being some guy in a robe who paces back and forth and has his own matching musical theme
[1:59:15] <Kotokaname> HE GOT A GUN
[1:59:32] <$SGrim> CLIMB DOWN HIS URETHRA!
[1:59:34] <+realm_forge> That giant will feed the kingdom for generations
[1:59:40] <%Samex_Comex> They will have a navy when he cums
[1:59:45] <+sonofthedeepsouth> Holy shit
[1:59:48] <Dunmarkh> oh shit
[1:59:49] <whispersilk001> Kingdom Cum
[1:59:50] <+polothegreatest> nukes
[1:59:52] <JoshManVGH> The tiniest bukke
[1:59:52] <Kotokaname> WOKE
[1:59:53] <+sonofthedeepsouth> OH SHIT
[1:59:56] <%silvery_cricket> OH GOD HE IS CUMMING
[1:59:56] <+sonofthedeepsouth> MY WAR
[2:00:00] <+Mekhet09> Fucking measles.
[2:00:01] <Kaji04> He woke up way too calm for a gunshot
[2:00:01] <alroy900> it took a fucking gunshot
[2:00:03] <+Ynkubus_> AWAKEN
[2:00:04] <+Mekhet09> Jesus.
[2:00:06] <JoshManVGH> bukake, however its spelled
[2:00:07] <schuenator> Build a building that goes up in his ass. He’ll be really embarrassed when we’re done with construction
[2:00:12] <TheAsylumCat> he farts that's a warcrime
[2:00:20] <+realm_forge> I AM YOUR GOD NOW
[2:00:30] <Presence_Eternal> I am now a god.
[2:00:35] <Presence_Eternal> I deserve this.
[2:00:37] <%silvery_cricket> OH GOD THOSE TINY ROPES ARE USELESS
[2:00:40] <%PittCat> Immediately starts global warming with the yawn
[2:00:47] <+Mekhet09> It was a bit but not by much.
[2:00:48] <$SGrim> The book is longer than the movie
[2:00:51] <alroy900> alright, attack on titan starts playing
[2:00:54] <%silvery_cricket> Imagine if Gulliver just eats him
[2:00:59] <+sonofthedeepsouth> OH NO
[2:01:00] <yukichocomilk> time to murder this entire city
[2:01:00] <%silvery_cricket> just bites off his head
[2:01:06] <Kaji04> OMNOMNOM

[2:01:19] <+realm_forge> FINISH HIM
[2:01:24] <fluffy_sauce> high in fibre
[2:01:25] <+sonofthedeepsouth> A Pat
[2:01:27] <+polypolipauli> When does he get the chainsaw arm?
[2:01:34] <%cosmicleviathan18> *flick*
[2:01:35] <%silvery_cricket> Shouldn't his voice rattle the earth like an earthquake
[2:01:38] <+Mekhet09> Is it still cannibalism?
[2:01:40] <+sonofthedeepsouth> How do you speak his language
[2:01:48] <%silvery_cricket> "No one is gonna hurt you" *unzips pants*
[2:01:58] <schuenator> Fetish mode quietly activating for some people
[2:02:03] <+Mrbaconator> as an englishman he will act on his instinct to colonize and seize all the land here
[2:02:05] <TheAsylumCat> @silvery_cricket into the jar we go
[2:02:13] <%silvery_cricket> @TheAsylumCat NOOOO
[2:02:14] <Presence_Eternal> I demand a plate of sliders. Not less than three babies each.
[2:02:15] <tanarath> Time for the princess to realize she has a specific set of fetishes soon.
[2:02:38] <JoshManVGH> Imagine Gulliver just taking out a box of matches.
[2:02:47] <+MightyDuckShoes> when does he swallow the tiny men so they can fall asleep cozily in his belly?
[2:02:50] <%cosmicleviathan18> the tiny people have a navy
[2:02:54] <JoshManVGH> Most destructive force they've ever seen
[2:02:57] <+Sebbers_and_Eggs> man he can level their town with a single leg sweep.. this isnt worth it
[2:03:01] <Kotokaname> what timming
[2:03:18] <+sonofthedeepsouth> Crqzy ass little people
[2:03:20] <schuenator> Amazing to see where giantess pron originated from
[2:03:32] <%Samex_Comex> Them writing "Forever" on the wall was a nice touch
[2:03:35] <yukichocomilk> EAT THE KING
[2:03:47] <%silvery_cricket> Man imagine if the Taliban just had a giant man
[2:04:06] <+sonofthedeepsouth> I mean you are like 100 meters tall to them my guy
[2:04:08] <+realm_forge> Gulliver sounds high as shit
[2:04:20] <$SGrim> Wouldn't difference in size result in Gulliver's voice deafening most of the micro-men?
[2:04:22] <+polypolipauli> Are crabs Kaiju for this civilization?
[2:04:30] <%silvery_cricket> Yes Gulliver rule them as a god
[2:04:32] <%silvery_cricket> a mighty god
[2:04:35] <%silvery_cricket> AN ANGRY GOD
[2:04:38] <schuenator> Blasted eardrums for miles
[2:04:39] <+sonofthedeepsouth> Wouldnt you think you were high as shit if you were in his place
[2:04:43] <+Mrbaconator> general kenobi
[2:04:50] <%cosmicleviathan18> You couldn't see a giant man leaning on your house?!
[2:04:50] <TheAsylumCat> @realm_forge given his situation he probably thinks he is
[2:05:02] <%silvery_cricket> I wonder if this is like a super huge star from the 30's
[2:05:05] <%Samex_Comex> "Make her fear it"
[2:05:07] <Kotokaname> what would you do grapes if you were in this small village
[2:05:21] <stranger59> Imagine if he just whipped it out and pissed everywhere.
[2:05:21] <JoshManVGH> Gulliver just sticks his entire dick into a brothel
[2:05:27] <$SGrim> My penis is larger than your whole village
[2:05:29] <+Sebbers_and_Eggs> assert dominance, crush a building
[2:05:38] <+polypolipauli> I too can lick anyone my size huehue
[2:05:43] <%silvery_cricket> "I can tea bag with the best of them your majesty"
[2:05:54] <+sonofthedeepsouth> You know what I am king now
[2:06:02] <Kotokaname> what will he eat??
[2:06:02] <schuenator> It could still happen. We could have a meteor hit earth and a giant alien man or woman (if we’re lucky) emerges
[2:06:02] <%PittCat> How the hell can he hear what they are saying? Like listening to an ant
[2:06:04] <+sonofthedeepsouth> Said Gulliver
[2:06:04] <%Samex_Comex> I hunger
[2:06:09] <%silvery_cricket> @sonofthedeepsouth You mean War God?
[2:06:10] <%Explodincatz> "surely SOMEONE in this village has a fetish for a big guy like me?"
[2:06:14] <TwoStarPlayersNik> Wouldn't it be fun if he just stepped on one
[2:06:16] <TheAsylumCat> @kotokaname all the horses
[2:06:19] <Redne22> so...when is the wedding?
[2:06:20] <schuenator> I’m glad I can’t hear ants
[2:06:21] <TwoStarPlayersNik> And then it becomes a huge deal
[2:06:26] <+realm_forge> OH NO HE’S TEABAGGING THE ORPHANAGE
[2:06:31] <JoshManVGH> Wasn't this part of the book like, one chapter?
[2:06:35] <+sonofthedeepsouth> All these resources for one guy
[2:06:41] <+sonofthedeepsouth> Clothing him
[2:06:45] <%silvery_cricket> This is an elaborate masturbation machine
[2:06:45] <whispersilk001> clothing him cinderella mouse style.
[2:06:48] <%PittCat> It would be terrifying if we could hear ants
[2:06:51] <JoshManVGH> Putting a glove on him or something
[2:06:58] <$SGrim> @schuenator Why only one? Perhaps a whole new race to co-habitate earth with millions or billions of massive women.
[2:07:01] <%silvery_cricket> Imagine if you had a town giant
[2:07:01] <whispersilk001> Isn't that basically church gospel music?
[2:07:03] <+polypolipauli> Give him a chainsaw arm already
[2:07:07] <stranger59> You... you don't have a town song you have to sing on command?
[2:07:08] <+Ynkubus_> @joshmanvgh yep, there's a bunch of places gullivers yet to go
[2:07:09] <JoshManVGH> Why are his eyes closed?
[2:07:10] <+polothegreatest> GOD needs silk clothes
[2:07:11] <Dunmarkh> @JoshManVGH yeah but it's more family friendly than other parts
[2:07:32] <%Bluwizard21> twerkin
[2:07:46] <JoshManVGH> i guess that explains all the protracted bullshit
[2:07:47] <%Explodincatz> American pledge in school and all that
[2:07:49] <schuenator> We do have our own town songs. National anthem man. Not sure i’d sing it while working on a giant man, but whatever
[2:07:54] <%Samex_Comex> Damn these little guys are skilled
[2:07:54] <tinytinykittycat> Singing "hap hap happy day" would make me want to die
[2:08:07] <whispersilk001> Some of these villagers are shaking their asses. Kinda wildin'
[2:08:12] <Presence_Eternal> Your service pleases me. I shall spare you. Today.
[2:08:13] <TwoStarPlayersNik> This is like the scene with the mice in Cinderella, but creepy
[2:08:14] <$SGrim> What a wonderful little servile race. So happy to labor for their betters.
[2:08:16] <%silvery_cricket> I wonder how they will feed him?
[2:08:19] <Kotokaname> MARIO
[2:08:23] <+sonofthedeepsouth> TNow feed the giant
[2:08:24] <+polypolipauli> Do you think they shaved his balls as well?
[2:08:26] <schuenator> You’ll see the feeding
[2:08:30] <schuenator> And drinking
[2:08:33] <%cosmicleviathan18> they just slit his throat ztbStab ztbStab ztbStab
[2:08:35] <%silvery_cricket> The giant requires meat
[2:09:02] <%silvery_cricket> OH GOD HE FELL IN HIS PANTS
[2:09:11] <schuenator> Do you save all the nude versions of your drawings in a safe that you will bequeath to your offspring and it will be worth millions of dollars?
[2:09:16] <+sonofthedeepsouth> Manicure
[2:09:21] <%silvery_cricket> EAT HIM GULLIVER
[2:09:24] <%Samex_Comex> I want a crew of tiny people
[2:09:28] <%Explodincatz> off to work bye dear
[2:09:34] <+sonofthedeepsouth> Destroyed the town
[2:09:46] <%silvery_cricket> You know this is basically how Harvest works in Jojo
[2:09:46] <%PittCat> I've bankrupted this village
[2:09:47] <+realm_forge> Worship meeee
[2:09:49] <$SGrim> @silvery_cricket Imagine how far an ejaculation would sent the tiny man.
[2:09:50] <JoshManVGH> An entire generations worth of materials to cloth this one man.
[2:09:50] <schuenator> Nice drip
[2:09:52] <Redne22> lol
[2:10:00] <tanarath> Show the princess that tree trunk.
[2:10:03] <@Nightbot> Plague is a youtube animator and also streams at https://picarto.tv/Plague . Also: t-shirts! http://goo.gl/lze8QO
[2:10:09] <+realm_forge> They celebrated with an orgy
[2:10:11] <%silvery_cricket> Mate the giant with a woman
[2:10:16] <%silvery_cricket> and create a race of ubermensch
[2:10:35] <%silvery_cricket> Even if they only grew to a foot tall they would be unstoppable
[2:10:54] <%silvery_cricket> Gulliver father of giants
[2:10:59] <+sonofthedeepsouth> I mean 8f the prince is so sad he can always kill his father for thqt cooch
[2:11:08] <+sonofthedeepsouth> just thinm a little
[2:11:08] <%Explodincatz> holy shit thats menacing
[2:11:17] <schuenator> Booze!
[2:11:20] <$SGrim> @silvery_cricket jam the sperm in with a septum if you must!
[2:11:21] <JoshManVGH> That's like 80 years of beer to them!!
[2:11:23] <+polypolipauli> He's go to eat the entire year's harvest in a day
[2:11:29] <yukichocomilk> that lighting is insane
[2:11:30] <+sonofthedeepsouth> This dinner was the whole year worth of food
[2:11:41] <Presence_Eternal> On the plus side, he catches one fish, they're set for a...well, I guess they'd have to feed him the fish.
[2:11:44] <%silvery_cricket> They have to slaughter a whale every morning
[2:11:47] <tanarath> A whole decade's worth
[2:11:47] <%silvery_cricket> just to sate him
[2:11:55] <Redne22> where did tha bird go?
[2:12:01] <%cosmicleviathan18> has the princess said anything besides sing?
[2:12:17] <Dunmarkh> @cosmicleviathan18 don't think so
[2:12:19] <%Samex_Comex> Bimbo Bombo
[2:12:23] <%silvery_cricket> YES DANCE FOR YOUR GIANT GOD
[2:12:27] <+sonofthedeepsouth> Every clap is a shockwave
[2:12:27] <Presence_Eternal> Please. Stop clapping. You have cost ten people their hearing.
[2:12:30] <JoshManVGH> Uuuuugh!
[2:12:36] <+realm_forge> An entire harvest was sacrificed only to give Gulliver dysentery
[2:12:39] <schuenator> Ah here he is. I remember this from when I watched this as a kid. Wow. I’m seeing this moment maybe 30 years later from when I last saw it
[2:12:47] <JoshManVGH> nope
[2:12:47] <%lemoan> same
[2:12:56] <Kaji04> Yooouuuuuu
[2:13:02] <%ralphwiggum16> Plague, the kings are just doing their best. You're always being cynical and mean.
[2:13:03] <%silvery_cricket> Yes dance dance for your god you tiny mortals
[2:13:12] <JoshManVGH> All he did was SIT UP!
[2:13:12] <%cosmicleviathan18> yoooo break it down

[2:13:23] <Dunmarkh> Just sonic boom them
[2:13:23] <%Samex_Comex> Yeah dance king!
[2:13:29] <TwoStarPlayersNik> how would you go about killing him?
[2:13:32] <Kotokaname> Rips a lrge fat fart they all die o3o
[2:13:35] <%silvery_cricket> You are nothing but toys to this giant
[2:13:41] <%ralphwiggum16> Ok, now I hate the king.
[2:13:42] <%lemoan> damn got the moves
[2:13:47] <+Sebbers_and_Eggs> his claps should deafen them at least
[2:13:52] <Kaji04> I mean, he's not a giant, right? they're just small iirc
[2:13:53] <schuenator> Crawl up inside him and siege his innards
[2:13:58] <%silvery_cricket> God I want to read Gullivers Travels but from like a super nihlistic writer
[2:14:02] <TheAsylumCat> his body heat must be cooking them
[2:14:05] <Dunmarkh> @Kaji04 yeah
[2:14:08] <%silvery_cricket> Like Alan Moore's Gulliver's Travels
[2:14:11] <%cosmicleviathan18> now he needs a finger board LUL
[2:14:12] <JoshManVGH> Now they're married
[2:14:19] <tanarath> All of their building atomize, killing everyone in the kingdom, as the giant can't stop laughing
[2:14:25] <Redne22> i assume he just thinks hes high off his mind and this is all a dream
[2:14:28] <Redne22> i would
[2:14:40] <+sonofthedeepsouth> I mean a knife to the eye would still hurt him
[2:14:51] <Kotokaname> shoot him with his own gun
[2:14:52] <TheAsylumCat> @redne22 magic mushrooms were common then
[2:14:58] <TwoStarPlayersNik> but how do you get up there to stab him in the eye?
[2:15:01] <%Explodincatz> always go for the eyes
[2:15:12] <JoshManVGH> Might be stolen
[2:15:18] <%silvery_cricket> his steps at the very least shuld put craters in their roads
[2:15:20] <stranger59> Is there an Assassin's Creed game where you have to kill Guliver with his own gun?
[2:15:23] <TheAsylumCat> @twostarplayersnik we're getting into huge quest territory
[2:15:23] <JoshManVGH> Cause Fuck Walt
[2:15:26] <%silvery_cricket> like their infastructure should be ruined
[2:15:39] <Redne22> this is werid
[2:15:42] <+sonofthedeepsouth> Itbsure go weird
[2:15:43] <%PittCat> They're still sitting in chairs you mororn
[2:15:44] <%silvery_cricket> BOOM BOOM BOOM
[2:15:44] <Kaji04> It feels "aimless"
[2:15:46] <%silvery_cricket> with each step
[2:15:48] <%Gigagoat> if the kings just made out none of this would be happening
[2:15:55] <Presence_Eternal> "CRUNCH" Ah dang it. Not another one.
[2:15:58] <$SGrim> THE GUN
[2:16:00] <whispersilk001> Gulliver the Godzilla sized man just snuck away.
[2:16:00] <Redne22> omg they are gonna shoot him!
[2:16:02] <$SGrim> IS GOOD
[2:16:10] <%cosmicleviathan18> wait are they sleeping in their thrones?
[2:16:16] <+sonofthedeepsouth> Smoking that pipe
[2:16:21] <%silvery_cricket> His pipe smoke should cover the kingdom in a thousand years of darkness
[2:16:22] <$SGrim> THE PENIS
[2:16:27] <+sonofthedeepsouth> crazy water
[2:16:34] <Janzer_> they'll shoot him in the temple and his blood will drain into the ocean, lapping onto the beach. good times.
[2:16:37] <+Sebbers_and_Eggs> wouldnt waves, and the tide, be immense to them
[2:16:38] <Redne22> @plagueofgripes did you ever play helltaker on steam?
[2:16:39] <$SGrim> IS EVIL
[2:16:46] <+polypolipauli> Are crows like dragons for them?
[2:16:50] <%silvery_cricket> Imagine if the town woke up and he was just violently masturbating to the sea
[2:16:50] <Presence_Eternal> Now to wake up their entire civilization with my singing.
[2:16:51] <%lemoan> that water beautiful
[2:17:07] <Presence_Eternal> Hello sailor.
[2:17:09] <Redne22> lol
[2:17:26] <%silvery_cricket> SPLIT THE SEA WITH YOUR MIGHTY STRENGTH GULLIVER
[2:17:29] <cahv123> why is it that dragons in human form are always given pointed ears? They actually can shapeshift perfectly so are they imitating elves instead of humans?
[2:17:43] <$SGrim> @PlagueOfGripes if you found a new species of minature people, would you really be comping at the bit to leave after one day?
[2:18:02] <+sonofthedeepsouth> Gave them a navy in a couple of hours
[2:18:10] <%silvery_cricket> SMASH
[2:18:16] <+sonofthedeepsouth> Shipyards obsolete
[2:18:17] <%silvery_cricket> why would you ever get near his feat
[2:18:28] <Presence_Eternal> That's a good idea. Run in front of the giant when he isn't paying attention to where he is going.
[2:18:38] <%silvery_cricket> I would rule them as a god
[2:18:38] <Presence_Eternal> Reminds me of my cat.
[2:18:38] <TwoStarPlayersNik> OK, I think I would use dynamite if I wanted to try to kill him
[2:18:41] <%cosmicleviathan18> the drawing is coming a long nicely
[2:18:51] <%silvery_cricket> An angry god
[2:19:01] <TwoStarPlayersNik> He has to sleep outdoors, so it should be easy enough to blow a hole in his neck
[2:19:01] <%Samex_Comex> Don't eat the gummy bear people
[2:19:37] <Redne22> hahah
[2:20:02] <+Mekhet09> He likes prime.
[2:20:06] <Dunmarkh> Oh shit the gun
[2:20:13] <whittacre> He's trying to overcome that hatred
[2:20:25] <Presence_Eternal> Yes, this his how normal people behave.
[2:20:32] <Julkson> In old movies nothing happened for the entire movie. In modern movies there's too much happening
[2:20:36] <%silvery_cricket> Couldn't they have just used a regular cannon?
[2:20:40] <%silvery_cricket> it be about the same size
[2:20:57] <Kotokaname> fire hazard
[2:20:59] <+sonofthedeepsouth> Oh you dumb idiot
[2:21:03] <+Sebbers_and_Eggs> the other king’s cannons just bounced off him tho..
[2:21:06] <%Explodincatz> oh NOW the ground shakes

[2:22:43] <%cosmicleviathan18> plagueFace plagueFace plagueFace
[2:22:55] <+polypolipauli> The giant with the tiny weewee meets the tiny princess with the gaping hole
[2:22:55] <%Samex_Comex> Most songs are about wanting to bang
[2:22:57] <%silvery_cricket> Dude you got a 14 mm dick
