[0:04:10] <Coystick> Watcha drawin' sailor?
[0:04:13] <%bettysharkface> You didn't say a name
[0:04:23] <%bettysharkface> You said all that without a name stating
[0:04:23] <jillyams> helo
[0:04:24] <+shadic7700> Makes sense for an Eldrich priest
[0:04:42] <+stinkomeanie> That ekum bokum korone meme exploded too.
[0:04:46] <ka0su> Honestly all of them are growing on me in different ways
[0:04:46] <locobo98> time for plague to make a refference
[0:04:52] <Coystick> Pochi?
[0:04:53] <%bettysharkface> I didn't hear, weird
[0:04:56] <ka0su> It's shocking how different Amelia is from her debut
[0:04:56] <locobo98> or as other like to say, take a selfie
[0:05:25] <+DakotaMacDoodle> I'm waiting for the Reverse Mermaid Vtuber
[0:05:31] <%bettysharkface> Anyway, I stand by you just straight up being a cat if you make a vtube.
[0:05:38] <+shadic7700> I‚Äôm a huge sucker for the Sherlock novels so Watson basically had an unfair advantage
[0:05:40] <%bettysharkface> Just a talking cat
[0:05:48] <Coystick> It's just a face cam on a dead fish
[0:06:14] <+stinkomeanie> Is that a dick and balls?
[0:06:17] <%bettysharkface> You have the voice a cat would have.
[0:06:32] <Aussie_Manny> !sr Some Copyrighted Disney Shit
[0:07:04] <ka0su> the eldritch one said Watson helped them a lot with technical stuff
[0:07:19] <Coystick> Bluepoint killing it with that DeS trailer
[0:07:38] <+shadic7700> Watson eats sand and likes thighs she is literally perfect

[0:09:47] <Coystick> Do the spine thing
[0:09:51] <+corrosivePaladin> clearly buttchest
[0:09:54] <%bettysharkface> Mirror?
[0:10:00] <Daxalog> Butt in the front. And Chest in a mirror
[0:10:02] <locobo98> have the character standing in front of a mirror
[0:10:04] <Coystick> Imagine if butt had nipples
[0:10:05] <+Reverend_Roscoe> just Liefeld it
[0:10:06] <KingKrampus> well aint this a coincidence, I was just talking with someone about wanting to see a Spyrosona for Plague, Pat and Paige
[0:10:18] <locobo98> side pose?
[0:10:48] <locobo98> you can always refference playboy magazenes
[0:10:56] <derangedhobo_> Living in Australia I enjoy a weird hour steam I can catch, well at least the start of one.
[0:10:58] <+shadic7700> NOT 2 Things oh the horror! I say as a non artist
[0:10:58] <+Reverend_Roscoe> is that a beer?
[0:11:00] <+stinkomeanie> What would Mirror Universe Plague be like?
[0:11:09] <%bettysharkface> Hum
[0:11:14] <locobo98> more hair
[0:11:15] <KingKrampus> what WOULD Plague's Spyrosona even be
[0:11:26] <locobo98> him in a cheap spyro kigurumi
[0:11:32] <KingKrampus> nah nah
[0:11:52] <simonespinozzi> i'm told robots can do tricks üòÇüëçüíñ https://64.media.tumblr.com/c0fad6ad073767abd82aa23e444ccb2e/tumblr_nk10fyECWw1rcnqeto1_540.gif
[0:12:03] <KingKrampus> I'm picturing like, Gnasty Gnork for Plague
[0:12:16] <locobo98> shes gonna have big ol honkers
[0:12:19] <KingKrampus> paige is obviously a faun
[0:12:25] <KingKrampus> pat is ripto
[0:12:39] <Coystick> He'd be the NPC at the start of a level, and peg a dragon egg at Spyro "here's your egg I did it, get out"
[0:12:41] <locobo98> plague is just a troll livingu nder a bridge doing his own thing
[0:13:01] <%bettysharkface> Bean
[0:13:02] <+ConLin_Arts_> what is the horny today?
[0:13:13] <inebriated_llama1> hey @plagueofgripes what did you think of the new demons souls gameplay?
[0:13:14] <KingKrampus> oooooooh, plague as bridge troll, noice
[0:13:16] <Coystick> The precious, precious rump
[0:13:40] <locobo98> hand on hip
[0:13:41] <%bettysharkface> Stretching out the arm?
[0:13:44] <locobo98> or holding somehting
[0:13:48] <KingKrampus> yes but Plague, what's the point if she ain't THIIIIIIIIICCCCCC
[0:13:58] <+EpicBigchill> plague time
[0:14:13] <%bettysharkface> Stretch up, like a wave?
[0:14:21] <locobo98> just have her holding a vase ,so its ocnsiddered high art
[0:14:36] <locobo98> remember, its not lewd if shes holdign a vase
[0:14:37] <KingKrampus> gotta have fig leaves to be high art
[0:14:38] <Coystick> Always nice to add some depth to the pose
[0:14:49] <locobo98> hand on hip
[0:14:56] <%bettysharkface> Flippers...
[0:14:59] <%bettysharkface> = w=
[0:15:01] <Coystick> Pretty particles tho
[0:15:15] <DillionPHCO> It's baffling that people are asking if it's gonna have a difficulty option
[0:15:20] <+stinkomeanie> Plague have you checked out Cobra Kai?
[0:15:51] <locobo98> sequel to karate kid
[0:15:51] <KingKrampus> suddenly I'm wondering if this is just Imp Midna
[0:16:06] <%bettysharkface> Hand behind head?
[0:16:17] <+stinkomeanie> Series after the Karate Kid movies
[0:16:20] <Coystick> Kinda digging the new Vanguard design seeing it in motion, very...corpulent
[0:16:40] <locobo98> will you ever considder switching to a different art program
[0:16:42] <locobo98> like Krita
[0:16:42] <+zooeymainbtw> @plagueofgripes favorite Hololive EN girl?
[0:17:11] <ka0su> a
[0:17:19] <Kruthak775> Each time I watch an art stream, I am reminded I have a map I've procrastinated with completing on paper for two years. The cycle never ends.
[0:17:24] <KingKrampus> @coystick link to the corpulent vanguard design plz?
[0:17:25] <Coystick> This is idol talk
[0:17:45] <+FleetmasterEddie> Calli got me so fast, she had my number in the first five minutes
[0:17:54] <+PleasantLee> noctowl?
[0:17:59] <locobo98> midna?
[0:18:00] <Coystick> @KingKrampus he's in the trailer my dude, end of the tutorial
[0:18:02] <+Draylle> that rabbit pokemon?
[0:18:02] <ka0su> Didn't expect to like Gura but she's very amusing
[0:18:03] <DillionPHCO> Oh you Lee
[0:18:17] <locobo98> oh scorbunny
[0:18:24] <+PleasantLee> I dont keep up with the latest furry stuff
[0:18:40] <KingKrampus> scorbunny's name makes me think of a scorpion x bunny
[0:18:41] <maze_mage> What‚Äôs up everyone o/
[0:18:56] <locobo98> i dont care much about the pokemans
[0:18:57] <Coystick> Some kind of Digimon
[0:18:58] <locobo98> im an old man
[0:19:01] <$Livelinne> Who‚Äôs that pokeyman!? OhMyDog
[0:19:06] <+stinkomeanie> Figuring out what weird Pok√©mon plague is drawing.
[0:19:09] <+shadic7700> ITS EvEe
[0:19:13] <locobo98> i age a year for every day that passes
[0:19:14] <+PleasantLee> furry community moves a mile a minute these days. theres a nintendo direct in 30 minutes, gonna be some new furry shit in an hour from now
[0:19:18] <RahnalH102> Scorbunny, Raboot, Cinderace
[0:19:23] <%bettysharkface> I gave up on the pokemon
[0:19:24] <+stinkomeanie> Is that a nintendo?
[0:19:36] <DillionPHCO> The middle evolutions are always so forgettable
[0:19:36] <PumpAction> Cinderace :O
[0:19:43] <+shadic7700> Wait is Raboot the actual name...
[0:19:53] <PumpAction> Yes :)
[0:19:56] <%bettysharkface> Breaks my nostalgic heart, but the games just weren't working for me
[0:20:05] <bettysharkface> Oh
[0:20:07] <+FleetmasterEddie> I didn't like the starter designs this time around. Usually one is atleast workable, but I dumped my grooky the second I found Nickit.
[0:20:08] <%bettysharkface> Oh dear
[0:20:09] <Coystick> There should really only be two evolutions for anyone of them
[0:20:12] <DillionPHCO> Jesus christ
[0:20:14] <DillionPHCO> alkXD
[0:20:23] <+shadic7700> I mean it makes sense but compared to Cinderace and Scorbunny it‚Äôs kinda
[0:20:30] <Zebroneath> Poor boy
[0:20:31] <+stinkomeanie> Eventually he‚Äôll sexualize Reboot characters
[0:20:46] <Coystick> "It is only birthing hips, why must you be mad?"
[0:20:47] <+jiggy_snipe> Plague: I don't care about this, I just wanna sexualize it plagueFace
[0:21:05] <+shadic7700> Karens are just lovely people huh...
[0:21:05] <PumpAction> thingiLUL
[0:21:06] <DillionPHCO> Stop alkXD
[0:21:24] <+Draylle> but that's lewd D:
[0:21:26] <+PleasantLee> pokemon ‚â† animals
[0:21:29] <locobo98> but they have a voery horny looking machamp as a companion
[0:21:35] <+shadic7700> Humans are animals tho... wink
[0:21:42] <Coystick> Jesus is a pokemon, the crucifix was the world's first Pokeball
[0:21:47] <+Nicos143> That‚Äôs why I‚Äôm here
[0:21:51] <+FleetmasterEddie> That's your Epitaph bro. "I don't care I just want to sexualize it" Eli-20XX
[0:21:55] <locobo98> its not clothing
[0:21:55] <+corrosivePaladin> you dont like flesh pants?
[0:21:58] <+stinkomeanie> Something something drawing sexy Pok√©mon is bad - Exodus 1:17
[0:21:58] <locobo98> its skin flaps
[0:22:07] <+PleasantLee> donald duck evolves, grows a pair of sailor trousers with the bell bottoms
[0:22:07] <yet_another_brony> aww i love cinderace
[0:22:08] <+shadic7700> Fur and flesh pants
[0:22:11] <locobo98> disgusting fleshi skin flaps that hang off their lewd bodies
[0:22:11] <$cellularmishap> isnt that just fur? grown clothes
[0:22:12] <%bettysharkface> I don't like Sylveon for that reason. The whole...flesh ribbons thing...
[0:22:26] <+shadic7700> Like hitmonchamps gloves
[0:22:35] <locobo98> not gloves
[0:22:42] <+shadic7700> Are his fingers fused together
[0:22:45] <locobo98> its jsut tumorous flesh sacks
[0:22:48] <yet_another_brony> also i saw the giant sperm post show up in some reaction video
[0:22:54] <Mr_Strut> I am learning more about pokemon than I ever wanted to.
[0:23:00] <yet_another_brony> hitmonchan doesn't have fingers
[0:23:06] <locobo98> the giant sperm tries to slither away
[0:23:06] <yet_another_brony> just punch gobs
[0:23:13] <+shadic7700> Or Primeapes flesh gloves
[0:23:22] <+stinkomeanie> Twitch needs a hand holding up a lighter emote for these music moments.
[0:23:25] <%bettysharkface> Asymmetrical flesh ribbons too, not even centered. Truly awful.
[0:23:31] <GypsySquid> Razzledazzle
[0:23:40] <+DrKuhmilch> nymnOkey
[0:23:48] <locobo98> machamp just has a black pelvis
[0:23:52] <+shadic7700> Floof is the most important part
[0:23:56] <locobo98> its not wearing trunks
[0:24:07] <yet_another_brony> fur clothing can be done pretty well sometimes. like delphoxes robe
[0:24:07] <+Draylle> sawk and throh bother me so much, did they grow their gi? is it fur?
[0:24:11] <locobo98> its just black skin and a weird fleshb elt made out of had tissue
[0:24:12] <Coystick> Bunn tails on a butt are like the cherry on a sundae
[0:24:12] <+shadic7700> So then when he gets aroused...
[0:24:32] <%bettysharkface> Yeah they don't physically exist
[0:24:35] <locobo98> made from data
[0:24:37] <+stinkomeanie> There‚Äôs already humanoid Digimon too
[0:24:39] <yet_another_brony> yea the gi is skin
[0:24:40] <+shadic7700> Big animal gun!
[0:24:50] <$Livelinne> existe5Lighter existe5Lighter
[0:24:59] <locobo98> but in others they are jsut dumb animals
[0:25:05] <locobo98> how about miltank burgers
[0:25:10] <+jiggy_snipe> they are smarter animals
[0:25:13] <locobo98> or a fried magicarp
[0:25:19] <lemoan> Yeah, dogimon at least aren't meant to be animals. Just Digital Monsters
[0:25:21] <+shadic7700> Muk and grimer are living sludge
[0:25:31] <+Draylle> sometimes they're dumb sometimes they're smart. it depends on what the story wants
[0:25:43] <+Third_Mattress> speaking of animal women, theres is a weird stardew valley/rpg/ porn game where you fuck your livestock monster girls and it just feels so fucking wrong once you internalize that.
[0:25:44] <+shadic7700> And all of them eat poffins
[0:25:46] <yet_another_brony> they were once equal to people to the point of marriage
[0:25:49] <+FleetmasterEddie> they're a symbiotic client species. Humanity gives them purpose.
[0:25:58] <+DrKuhmilch> how has the abra line not have civilizations? they hae like 3000IQ and human bodies, thumbs and everything
[0:26:00] <$Livelinne> Yea the depiction of pokemans intelligence is confusing
[0:26:00] <+shadic7700> Why are you so erotic Gardevoir
[0:26:00] <yet_another_brony> but at some point people decided to make them pets instead
[0:26:05] <+DrKuhmilch> and youre telling me they just live in the grass?
[0:26:06] <yet_another_brony> mustve been awkward
[0:26:11] <locobo98> the fact that pokemon arent self sufficient only makes it easier to sexualise them as dependants of their trainers
[0:26:24] <Zedimonx5> @drkuhmilch they invented spoons
[0:26:37] <%bettysharkface> It is
[0:26:41] <+jiggy_snipe> yea it's good
[0:26:41] <locobo98> ITS FINE
[0:26:42] <+stinkomeanie> It‚Äôs a little low
[0:26:42] <Mr_Strut> Seems okay
[0:26:43] <$Livelinne> I think as lowerthe target audience gets, the pokemans gets smarter
[0:26:52] <+Reverend_Roscoe> its fine, but can be louder
[0:27:01] <DillionPHCO> Oh good
[0:27:02] <+PleasantLee> barely hear this song, but I'm about to leave so nvm
[0:27:02] <%bettysharkface> Woo, tinnitus
[0:27:06] <GKannel> It's fine
[0:27:08] <+stinkomeanie> It‚Äôs 80s rock it needs to be blasted
[0:27:08] <$Livelinne> grannDisco grannDisco
[0:27:17] <+shadic7700> This is a weird conversation especially because most trainers start at 10 years old
[0:27:18] <Mr_Strut> Hooray, Plague is making himself deaf for our pleasure
[0:27:18] <yet_another_brony> i like delphox
[0:27:20] <+FleetmasterEddie> come on windows alert now is your time
[0:27:27] <yet_another_brony> the fur robe is cute and fluffy
[0:27:32] <$Livelinne> Alterations woolieSMUG
[0:27:58] <+shadic7700> And for some reason all aspects of life revolves around legal dog fights
[0:28:13] <osamajundi> are you going to make YouTube content similar to the Naruto video
[0:28:17] <+stinkomeanie> The song that allowed Heart to be played at big box retailers like Big Lots
[0:28:17] <yet_another_brony> its more like boxing and wrestling. but with animals
[0:28:24] <%WoRabbit> WoRabbit subscribed at Tier 1. 
[0:28:24] <+shadic7700> It‚Äôs like YuGiOh and card games
[0:28:29] <yet_another_brony> and they consent to a degree
[0:28:39] <+stinkomeanie> Would you still play Pok√©mon if they replaced all of them with chickens?
[0:28:46] <+DrKuhmilch> yes
[0:28:47] <@Nightbot> Plague is a youtube animator and also streams at https://picarto.tv/Plague . Also: t-shirts! http://goo.gl/lze8QO
[0:28:47] <+shadic7700> Yes
[0:29:00] <yet_another_brony> theres a lot of chicken pokemon
[0:29:04] <+shadic7700> I also she is a Phoenix not a chicken
[0:29:07] <%WoRabbit> Fair
[0:29:09] <+shadic7700> üòâ
[0:29:17] <yet_another_brony> yeah i like the setting more than the games
[0:29:20] <$Livelinne> But do we get 1000+ type of chickens?
[0:29:26] <KingKrampus> @stinkomeanie you wouldn't ask that if you knew the sheer VARIETY of chicken breeds there are
[0:29:31] <yet_another_brony> the sun and moon anine is super good
[0:29:40] <+Cadwae> Yeah, joining Eli's stream to that line, that drawing, and this music...what timeline are we in?
[0:29:43] <+PleasantLee> we all know whats going on out there! they dont talk about it, but they know!
[0:29:48] <Mr_Strut> Well that's terrifying
[0:29:48] <+shadic7700> I like the idea of a 10 year old capturing GOD and beating up other 10 year olds with it
[0:29:50] <+FleetmasterEddie> I have so many things you aren't allowed to sexualize...for...reasons
[0:29:54] <+PleasantLee> what gun did you use?
[0:30:00] <+DakotaMacDoodle> Dream? you sure
[0:30:00] <+shadic7700> Oh...fun
[0:30:00] <EdictEngine> Hell yeah
[0:30:02] <Mr_Strut> In the dream?
[0:30:03] <cherrycottontail> Is this bunny truly thick enough?
[0:30:04] <+Draylle> in the dream?
[0:30:06] <+stinkomeanie> The first visitor on your land in years and you shot him.
[0:30:06] <+Engwithan_Elder_God> Fun dream
[0:30:07] <+NKOrange> yea that tracks
[0:30:10] <$Livelinne> lytUSEGUN lytUSEGUN lytUSEGUN
[0:30:10] <yet_another_brony> ive had that dream before. except pat gave me a water gun so i died
[0:30:11] <+EpicBigchill> Maruchan?
[0:30:18] <+shadic7700> Dream ramen is the beat
[0:30:18] <leinadtonu> maybe you just wanna shoot someone.
[0:30:18] <+PleasantLee> later gang
[0:30:21] <+brudus_maximus> The dream means you have to make the fence taller.
[0:30:22] <+Risingxiv> was that the American dream?
[0:30:31] <$Livelinne> Sapporo?
[0:30:32] <+shadic7700> You‚Äôre still dreaming wake up Eli
[0:30:49] <+stinkomeanie> He came for your sexy Pok√©mon and you stood your ground.
[0:30:50] <harrydrakee> That's a very american dream
[0:31:17] <+shadic7700> American is basically world culture
[0:31:20] <Coystick> American as apple pie
[0:31:24] <Mr_Strut> Then you get to hear the no true scotsman argument

[0:51:57] <TheFunniestValentine926> Hello there Orb man
[0:51:58] <LeftOverPizza13> the very notion of a stream
[0:52:10] <leinadtonu> sounds ominous
[0:52:17] <%bettysharkface> She is the secret spice.
[0:52:22] <OperatorJo_> this happened to Pat because he refused eekum bokum
[0:52:23] <+alpharius88> sounds fun (aka trashfire)
[0:52:23] <LeftOverPizza13> just do it
[0:52:25] <afraidanuffin> She meant she wanted to go fishing by the ol' stream, Plague
[0:52:54] <+Lobsterdinner> Did you get a voidmech yet plague? I haven't.
[0:52:59] <TheFunniestValentine926> She is planning to tie pat down and force him to 100% bank kazooie
[0:53:01] <leinadtonu> Pat should eekum bookum
[0:53:04] <Coystick> If I could animate I would animate "Have confidence...no confidence".

[0:56:45] <+kinmarik> just make it huge quest guy
[0:56:47] <Mr_Strut> The trick is just to make a cute anime girl
[0:57:01] <+Lobsterdinner> Would that mean more streams? That'd be cool.
[0:57:06] <%bettysharkface> I will draw what I imagine a vtube Plague looks like
[0:57:17] <afraidanuffin> My favorite theme from Dark Souls
[0:57:20] <+illoonar> GWYNEREAR
[0:57:55] <+kinmarik> jesus seath
[0:58:01] <Coystick> We can't get the stains out either
[0:58:36] <+stinkomeanie> These streams feel like training montages with these songs.
[0:58:59] <+kinmarik> art kinda be like that
[0:59:17] <+stinkomeanie> Watch Plague draw the ass over and over until he finally gets it right, with his sensei nodding to the side with a smile.
[0:59:35] <+stinkomeanie> Then he punches through a board.
[0:59:36] <mellorolo> people like men characatures, you dont need to make it appealing to yourself. But probably just make something for your audience to be able to project you on to.
[0:59:36] <+kinmarik> plaguedog sensei
[0:59:40] <Davetast1c> cinderace eh? lookin good so far. also watching your streams and youtube vids has really helped me understand paint tool sai 2 a lot more so i thank you.
[1:00:17] <+kinmarik> csp?
[1:00:19] <%bettysharkface> I did it, and it looks bad.
[1:00:23] <%bettysharkface> Success.
[1:00:23] <Panboy> ms paint?
[1:01:05] <afraidanuffin> Right as I was picking up Sai2, Plague looks for the door. Do I stink or something?
[1:01:07] <Coystick> Binary is SOUL
[1:01:27] <+kinmarik> sf3 art is basically ms paint stuff once you look closer
[1:01:32] <Panboy> when i was little and i didnt really understand that there was differnt software, i thoght all the computer graphics were done in paint
[1:01:36] <Davetast1c> i recently bought clip studio paint cause of the sale, it had some lag issues when you extend the screen to my onscreen tablet, but in duplicate displays, it works fine.
[1:02:15] <Panboy> csp has issues as it does not use your gpu like at all , its 100% software
[1:02:44] <Panboy> and cpus are not great at doing computer Graphics, which is why csp is laggy
[1:03:04] <+stinkomeanie> This must be the part where Plague‚Äôs sensei gets beaten up. Plague drives in his 86‚Äô mustang and remembers his training and puts on his master‚Äôs headband, and finally win the All Valley sexy Pok√©mon drawing tournament.
[1:03:07] <%bettysharkface> Suffering
[1:03:07] <Coystick> Whining
[1:03:09] <+jiggy_snipe> it's a mini direct
[1:03:11] <Mr_Strut> Not really
[1:03:15] <+jiggy_snipe> for Partner games
[1:03:16] <%JailShmixRemix> its a nintendo direct
[1:03:18] <YakumoYomi> It's a "Partner Showcase"
[1:03:20] <OperatorJo_> eh
[1:03:23] <Panboy> what even is a nintendo?
[1:03:23] <%JailShmixRemix> It's not gonna be interesting
[1:03:24] <+Lobsterdinner> I like watching you draw a lot more.
[1:03:28] <+Jamijji> Monster Hunter Rise about the only thing interesting, tbh
[1:03:34] <%bettysharkface> Mm, Plague streams are rare
[1:03:40] <+Jamijji> and that's only if you like monster hunter
[1:03:43] <YakumoYomi> Gottem
[1:03:46] <+stinkomeanie> Could give two craps about a new smash character
[1:03:47] <%bettysharkface> Oh dear
[1:03:52] <Davetast1c> yeah, it's manageable with duplicate displays on, but still slightly laggy, i found myself goin back to paint tool sai again.
[1:03:53] <Coystick> yeehaw

[1:11:53] <ikantreeed> just started using it
[1:11:55] <morcego_cinzento_arts> Crusader, i think they will straight up block your stream if you draw nude stuff
[1:11:57] <+CelioHogane> @LunarRemix well, since Spanish and Japanese have a very similar pronounciation, it seems Japanese have easy time learning Spanish
[1:12:02] <Coystick> I hope IRL Korone is a 30+ OL cake trying to not let it set in
[1:12:10] <LunarRemix> Wait really? @CelioHogane
[1:12:15] <ikantreeed> Clip Studio Paint

[1:12:56] <+CelioHogane> @LunarRemix Yeah totally, im Spanish and i can confirm, their romanji is phonetical writting, like Spanish.
[1:13:07] <YakumoYomi> @Coystick Considering Korone and Okayu's discussion on the price of candy a few months ago during an Apex stream, I wouldn't be surprised if they were in their 30s.
[1:13:10] <Panboy> i think i got a licence to corel draw on humble once

[1:13:28] <morcego_cinzento_arts> Crusader, i'm more or less certain. i mean you can draw very lewd pin ups as long as there's no tiddy or pee pee, or vagie showing. and no sex
[1:13:31] <%JailShmixRemix> @YakumoYomi they are, without doubt
[1:13:48] <boatzndhoez> wait , arent these songs gonna get plague in trouble?

[1:14:28] <+CelioHogane> Plague speaking Spanish sounds cursed.
[1:14:31] <Coystick> Blasphemous in Spanish is a delight
[1:14:33] <+CelioHogane> the spanish plague
[1:14:37] <CaptHat211> Hello, strangers!
[1:14:39] <+thereisneverenoughdakka> Hi Plague, how are you doing today?
[1:14:59] <+CelioHogane> NEVER BREAK KAYFABE
[1:15:01] <+0ni0n_L0rd> No shut up that makes it better
[1:15:01] <+bbuckets_> Man, I watch your naruto video like once a year, didn't know you streamed. Hello atpQuan
[1:15:08] <LunarRemix> One of them will try to be the mom in ther 30's character
[1:15:14] <Coystick> We're all our younger selves inside. Piloting old, decaying mecha, when you think about it
[1:15:15] <CaptHat211> Really? I heard some of them talk about their nephews so I assumed they were my age (30s).
[1:15:30] <+Nicos143> What do you mean that 191 year old dog girl isn‚Äôt really 191
[1:15:33] <%bettysharkface> I am 30, and therefore everyone else online is 30, and when they tell me they aren't, I get another grey hair.
[1:15:33] <+Andele1503> Some are as young as 21, some in their 40s
[1:15:35] <+CelioHogane> If you break Kayfabe, no-life scum will cry and harrass you
[1:15:39] <$Livelinne> I mean, there‚Äôs trend of middle aged men who turn into anime girls PrideShrug
[1:15:43] <+kinmarik> anime milfs CoolStoryBob
[1:15:48] <YakumoYomi> What? Koro-san is only 91!
[1:15:57] <faykeyfake> i saw some awesome fem incineror art earlier today it was awesome
[1:16:03] <+Andele1503> ironically it tends to be reverse of their character (the older IRL the younger the holo char and reverse)
[1:16:27] <+Lobsterdinner> I'm having trouble believing that Luna is 0 years old guys.
[1:16:29] <%JailShmixRemix> Especially on the smaller maps
[1:16:42] <+CelioHogane> @Andele1503 does that mean Luna is ancient or that Coco is a baby?
[1:16:44] <Panboy> there is an old game called Space Station 13 that is much more complex
[1:16:47] <locobo98> i mean
[1:16:48] <$Livelinne> Technology of voice converter is amazing tbh
[1:16:51] <+painting4> Maybe you should check out project winter as well
[1:16:55] <+spacehouse> only cowards and pedophiles cant appreciate christmas cake
[1:16:58] <Panboy> but space station 13 is also insane
[1:17:03] <boatzndhoez> plague the grey soon :O
[1:17:11] <%JailShmixRemix> SS13? where's betty when you need em
[1:17:11] <%bettysharkface> I'm going grey in the front first it seems.
[1:17:15] <%bettysharkface> Here.
[1:17:20] <%bettysharkface> I am here.
[1:17:21] <%bettysharkface> Hello.
[1:17:23] <+EpicBigchill> My greys are more silver, so they stand out pretty hard
[1:17:23] <+CelioHogane> My beard becomes red-haired fom my right side if it grows too long
[1:17:27] <YakumoYomi> Same. But my beard is dark brown (almost black).
[1:17:28] <+CelioHogane> IT'S MY MUTANT SUPERPOWER
[1:17:31] <Zebroneath> Being in high 20s, grey hair has appeared in my beard
[1:17:32] <%bettysharkface> Lol
[1:17:33] <+CelioHogane> HALF A RED BEARD
[1:17:37] <boatzndhoez> are you going to fight a demon while falling down in a pit anytime soon
[1:17:41] <%JailShmixRemix> VoHiYo hey betty, how r you
[1:17:44] <Coystick> Fatten the butt
[1:17:47] <Panboy> give it boobs plague
[1:17:47] <%bettysharkface> I have a headache
[1:17:47] <+0ni0n_L0rd> She plenty tasty as is buddy
[1:18:03] <+kinmarik> the eyebrows are the area that always looked goofy to me
[1:18:14] <$Livelinne> Bun cute lytMYHERO
[1:18:21] <afraidanuffin> Add clothes. The implication of what is hidden adds desirability.
[1:18:31] <+Lobsterdinner> Is it poor taste to ask an art question?
[1:18:31] <%Badpest> its all about the bunny love
[1:18:38] <%JailShmixRemix> Fix your head and you'll no longer feel pain! Or just take something for headaches idk
[1:18:53] <afraidanuffin> Depends on the art question, I'd suppose, Lob.
[1:18:54] <YakumoYomi> @CelioHogane Luna is clearly a granny, considering her laughably poor stamina.
[1:18:54] <%bettysharkface> My purple plague cat got 5 headpats on discord
[1:18:59] <%bettysharkface> I feel valid.
[1:19:03] <CaptHat211> Hey Eli how many people have requested art of the new English speaking VTubers?
[1:19:09] <Coystick> Turn them into thigh highs?
[1:19:29] <morcego_cinzento_arts> each headpat gives Betty more power
[1:19:31] <+CelioHogane> EMBRACE ROBOT, turn into a full cyborg, there will be no more pain anymore
[1:19:31] <$Livelinne> Hot pants
[1:19:39] <Coystick> High cuts
[1:19:40] <Davetast1c> thigh high pattern could be cool
[1:19:47] <+kinmarik> give gun
[1:19:50] <Kuj999> I thought you were doing a fusion between Link and Imp Midna
[1:19:53] <Coystick> bunn gun
[1:19:58] <+kinmarik> loaded gun
[1:20:01] <$Livelinne> Unbuttoned hot pants woolieSMUG
[1:20:03] <Panboy> Do you think there are japanese people watching english vtubers and thinking they are the cutest?
[1:20:15] <%bettysharkface> Shaaaak
[1:20:16] <+CelioHogane> All that Vtuber talks, don't forget the most powerfull of all Vtubers... THE BAZ.
[1:20:16] <YakumoYomi> It HAS to be Gura
[1:20:26] <Coystick> you can't lewd the shark
[1:20:38] <$cellularmishap> you already drew korone didnt you?
[1:20:38] <$Livelinne> sbfpBaz
[1:20:46] <Davetast1c> Nyanners is the stimkiest gremlin VTuber
[1:20:53] <+CelioHogane> @Livelinne Hell yeah brother
[1:20:55] <%bettysharkface> I want a shark hoodie.
[1:21:01] <+Andele1503> Gura or Ina would be the EN choices IMO that fit, as far as in general you need to finish what you started with Korone with Okayu
[1:21:20] <+polypolipauli> Wow! Hi Plague!
[1:21:23] <+kinmarik> the flesh collar
[1:21:35] <idleclock> I finally manage to catch a Plague stream live, nice
[1:21:41] <afraidanuffin> V-collar jersey
[1:21:52] <Panboy> turn it into a vshaped sports bra
[1:22:10] <Mr_Strut> Is that why you like her?
[1:22:13] <$Livelinne> Direct endeth
[1:22:23] <afraidanuffin> Nana? The pink iceclimber?
[1:22:28] <afraidanuffin> Oh
[1:22:48] <Davetast1c> I been watchin Nyanners since like forever back when she was just a voice actor
[1:23:03] <Coystick> I don't know, actors act different characters, the concept isn't too far off
[1:23:17] <CaptHat211> There's a movie in that sentence.
[1:23:22] <Panboy> that probably creates a terrible sense of dysphoria
[1:23:23] <Davetast1c> Nyanners pretty much has acted like that forever
[1:23:25] <%bettysharkface> Someone literally made a song about that
[1:23:34] <Daxalog> What exactly is this pokemon doing in this image?
[1:23:40] <YakumoYomi> That's what makes her relatable, I feel. It's something that draws people to vTubers in the first place. I wish more of them would realize that it's not just the avatar that people like.
[1:24:04] <afraidanuffin> Isn't that just how it always is? We all wear masks for different things in our life. I'm not the man at work I am with my friends. Both are genuinely me, but just tempered different.
[1:24:06] <Coystick> Good song to follow up on that
[1:24:16] <%bettysharkface> https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPSrw6ZYUA4
[1:24:21] <afraidanuffin> We all wear many hats
[1:24:27] <afraidanuffin> In fact, we are only hats
[1:24:34] <%Badpest> @bettysharkface oh yeah
[1:24:35] <+Lobsterdinner> Oh hey I called the song that you were referring to!
[1:24:46] <$Livelinne> If your persona giving joy to people than isn‚Äôt that enough for a reason?
[1:24:55] <+kinmarik> you think that happens with nonvtubin voice actors as well?
[1:24:57] <%bettysharkface> The music video is good too
[1:25:19] <+Lobsterdinner> The clown girl is cute, I'm literally one of the suckers the video shows.
[1:25:20] <mathbertoldo> A bit late to the stream, but has he talked about his opinions on the new Hololive group?
[1:25:23] <Davetast1c> more hats than a tf2 pro
[1:25:25] <mike2hands> is that the modest mouse song?
[1:25:33] <mike2hands> good morning btw
[1:25:44] <Coystick> Kneesocks
[1:25:45] <$Livelinne> Voice actors giving life to characters. Metaphorically.
[1:25:45] <afraidanuffin> @kinmarik imagine how much weight is constantly on the Darkest Dungeon narrator voice actor?
[1:25:49] <+kinmarik> not the flesh collar?
[1:25:53] <Panboy> always trying to get rid of pants, of course
[1:26:00] <$Livelinne> raquelPant raquelLess
[1:26:05] <Davetast1c> but yea voice actors are not their characters
[1:26:07] <berasite> SeemsGood
[1:26:09] <Coystick> Iron Horse is such a good band name
[1:26:22] <Davetast1c> maybe Charles Martinet
[1:27:01] <mathbertoldo> I'm guessing that was the case based on the most recent comments. Guess I'll wait and check out the VOD later.
[1:27:08] <$Livelinne> Do you have any idea how psaBig the voice actor fan base is in Japan buffpupScared
[1:27:17] <YakumoYomi> @Livelinne I'd imagine it's a little different, because people readily separate voice actors from characters most of the time. For vTubers, though, the "voice actor" is also giving the character personality.
[1:27:49] <%bettysharkface> Woo
[1:27:52] <LunarRemix> And then you have people telling the Vtubers to just act naturally and not do a character
[1:27:52] <$Livelinne> It‚Äôs scary actually
[1:27:52] <+kinmarik> it'll be like ya went deaf
[1:28:04] <Coystick> Heat death of the Universe here we come!
[1:28:16] <Davetast1c> muted cause music I'm guessin, always happens with drawing streams with music
[1:28:17] <mathbertoldo> It's this one, yeah. That's too bad, I wanted to hear you talk about the new girls.
[1:28:18] <+TheShisno> Yo we drawing the best Britbong starter?
[1:28:18] <LunarRemix> Mori even said on stream she was feeling conflicted on how to act, character vs herself
[1:28:22] <%AzureSkyKnight> AzureSkyKnight subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 21 months! I gave this much money I suppose
[1:28:43] <Davetast1c> some like daisy duke shorts?
[1:28:44] <$Livelinne> @yakumoyomi Yea I guess in that case, things gets bit more complicated
[1:28:44] <Coystick> What about the loose socks gyaru wear, but bunnified?
[1:28:50] <@Nightbot> Plague is a youtube animator and also streams at https://picarto.tv/Plague . Also: t-shirts! http://goo.gl/lze8QO
[1:28:55] <+ConLin_Arts_> like I preferred the more regular Matt and Pat compared to the Machinima characters they did
[1:28:56] <+Lobsterdinner> Could you tell early on that you were improving in your craft?
[1:29:04] <+TheShisno> Leggings
[1:29:06] <%AzureSkyKnight> What the design change goal here?
[1:29:17] <%bettysharkface> Music is kill?
[1:29:18] <+ConLin_Arts_> It feels forced when they try to be characters
[1:29:29] <Coystick> ...reverse bunny suit?
[1:29:30] <+ConLin_Arts_> what about stockings?
[1:29:35] <+ConLin_Arts_> high ones
[1:29:38] <Panboy> but thats how foot ball people dress in the sports ball game
[1:29:43] <Mr_Strut> Maybe leg warmers?
[1:29:52] <Coystick> chaps
[1:29:55] <%AzureSkyKnight> So like a unitard or something then?
[1:29:56] <JayCantDo> socks n crocs
[1:30:07] <Panboy> ive always found pokemon drawn looking like they have clothes werid
[1:30:20] <$Livelinne> luckyb20Owo luckyb20Owo luckyb20Owo
[1:30:22] <mathbertoldo> @conlin_arts_ That's a hit or miss, but it usually means it's more fun when they break out of character, like Pikamee swearing in english when frustrated.
[1:30:22] <Davetast1c> unitard might be ok
[1:30:29] <YakumoYomi> @LunarRemix Quite frankly, I just want her to not worry that her "real self" wouldn't be good enough for her fans. It's still early in her career, but you can tell she's struggling to keep up a character (especially with the "no swearing" bit)
[1:30:36] <mellorolo> wrap her up and put a pretty bow on it
[1:31:10] <+XdaXcaptainX> @YakumoYomi just got here, who are we discussing?
[1:31:12] <Coystick> Speed lines
[1:31:17] <LunarRemix> Which is ironic because I find her most fun to watch when she's just being herself and being a dork, like swearing and speaking with her non-cute voice
[1:31:59] <$Livelinne> Me likey
[1:32:06] <+JamesCorck> Lucario has the same `problem with its stupid baggy "pants"
[1:32:11] <%bettysharkface> Give it the MegaLopunny treatment?
[1:32:21] <Coystick> I think the chap lines are the cleanest option you have
[1:32:28] <+kinmarik> flesh clothing seems weird when it's not something else's flesh
[1:32:29] <mellorolo> pants are cool!
[1:32:31] <YakumoYomi> @XdaXcaptainX Mori Calliope, from Hololive EN
[1:32:33] <idleclock> Blue legs with an orange pattern?
[1:32:48] <+XdaXcaptainX> ahhh
[1:33:12] <$Livelinne> Thigh high HyperReveal HyperReveal
[1:33:16] <%AzureSkyKnight> So changing to look like bicycle pants
[1:33:20] <%AzureSkyKnight> Or similar
[1:33:43] <mathbertoldo> I believe Cali's whole thing is breaking out of character, which is why the fan community calls her gapmoe.
[1:34:04] <$Livelinne> Kornnnn raquelPlay
[1:34:12] <Davetast1c> make the yellow a leg/calf/knee tuft?
[1:34:40] <$Livelinne> grannDisco
[1:35:17] <morcego_cinzento_arts> that is an nice remix of A.D.I.D.A.S
[1:35:21] <+stinkomeanie> Holy crap I hear Korn
[1:35:27] <ahaegotrigger> LUL
[1:35:31] <+0ni0n_L0rd> pfft
[1:35:35] <%bettysharkface> Ha.
[1:35:37] <ahaegotrigger> thanks for the clarification
[1:35:41] <morcego_cinzento_arts> my fave Korn song is "Alone i Break"
[1:35:48] <$Livelinne> Like torn leggings effect? Noice
[1:35:54] <leinadtonu> I snorted
[1:36:23] <mathbertoldo> By the way, are VODs immediately muted upon being released, or do you have time to save and upload them elsewhere?
[1:36:29] <misterurbanthelegend> It looks like a post 2000 Footballer/Soccer Player.
[1:37:17] <+JamesCorck> Plague, will you be posting these to your NewGrounds later? I mean more your sketches, that is.
[1:37:25] <%AzureSkyKnight> What bothers you about it?
[1:37:48] <YakumoYomi> You makin' animal noises, Plague?
[1:37:54] <%bettysharkface> The red thing on its head might balance it
[1:38:16] <CaptHat211> Getting old is fun
[1:38:32] <mathbertoldo> Oh, nice. Then I'll make sure to download them as soon as you're done.
[1:38:41] <morcego_cinzento_arts> Is that 'I hope you dance' ?
[1:38:48] <MelBrooksKA> yes
[1:38:53] <CaptHat211> Gotta go to work. Shalom!
[1:38:54] <morcego_cinzento_arts> nice
[1:39:03] <morcego_cinzento_arts> bye bye cpathat
[1:39:08] <morcego_cinzento_arts> capthat
[1:40:11] <mathbertoldo> I'll also have to leave briefly, Cali's super chat stream is about to start.
[1:40:12] <Davetast1c> i also draw in reddish for sketches on grey backgrounds. is that a common thing?
[1:40:59] <%bettysharkface> Muscles.
[1:41:03] <%bettysharkface> Good.
[1:41:19] <morcego_cinzento_arts> usually i see people using cyan pencil for the sketching
[1:42:51] <Davetast1c> i have a vague memory of like, sketching with red pencils on brown paper in school, maybe that's why
[1:43:18] <misterurbanthelegend> Is this Pokemons special move that It pretends to break its leg and then cries to a ref to give the other Pokemon a Yellow card like a pussy.
[1:44:44] <+spaghetti_shaman> where are the bobs and wee?
[1:45:11] <+Lobsterdinner> I need to start paying attention to this chemistry lab see you later plague
[1:45:45] <Davetast1c> @spaghetti_shaman next to the cloaca
[1:46:39] <KosOrSomeSayKosm_> Plague art...Plart
[1:46:42] <Coystick> Red kneesocks, justice.
[1:47:41] <+JamesCorck> man, Cinderace's color palette is so weird.
[1:47:56] <+0ni0n_L0rd> Cute!
[1:48:02] <+0ni0n_L0rd> The colors look great on this
[1:48:23] <%bettysharkface> Even though it's naked, it...looks more naked?
[1:48:38] <%AzureSkyKnight> That looks WAY better then what they went with
[1:48:53] <%bettysharkface> Ye
[1:49:04] <@Nightbot> Plague is a youtube animator and also streams at https://picarto.tv/Plague . Also: t-shirts! http://goo.gl/lze8QO

[1:49:49] <Coystick> Khajiit
[1:49:53] <Fenlig> Too creepy
[1:49:56] <Dunmarkh> big the cat with tits
[1:49:57] <KosOrSomeSayKosm_> is the v-tuber you or an oc that represents you...ah I see
[1:49:57] <+JamesCorck> Look the way you already do, you're already perfect.
[1:49:58] <locobo98> baby
[1:50:08] <CynosZilla> Looks better, but I also don't like the "soccer uniform" from the original.
[1:50:09] <locobo98> grumpy old man
[1:50:16] <locobo98> just a horraable little goblin
[1:50:19] <%bettysharkface> Purple kitty.
[1:50:21] <%AzureSkyKnight> I like the grumpy cat man
[1:50:23] <+stinkomeanie> Look like a YouTube cartoon critic avatar.
[1:50:24] <Davetast1c> grumpy cat could work
[1:50:25] <LunarRemix> In my head you look like a wise old man, like those 900 year old anime old man
[1:50:30] <locobo98> chibi plague
[1:50:36] <+Andele1503> Grumpy farmer man
[1:50:36] <Coystick> I imagine you as a Channeler from Dark Souls
[1:50:39] <rajathene> Cute little black kitty ears on your current picture would be funny.
[1:50:48] <locobo98> you needa hat
[1:50:50] <%AzureSkyKnight> Grumpy cat
[1:50:52] <locobo98> some kind of accessory
[1:50:56] <locobo98> big ol eyes
[1:51:03] <locobo98> a cowboy hat
[1:51:13] <KosOrSomeSayKosm_> are you gonna live-2d ifi/rig it yourself or is someone else gonna do that?
[1:51:30] <+stinkomeanie> A monocle
[1:51:42] <+stinkomeanie> And a Monster Energy Drink tattoo
[1:51:47] <+spaghetti_shaman> I left a twitch stream because the person who claims to be a animation critic put adventure time S rank but never seen Brave and the Bold. Never seen such cultural simpery in my life.
[1:52:00] <+EpicBigchill> ohh man, its been a while since I heard this song

[1:54:03] <+stinkomeanie> ‚ÄúEvil is a man made concept‚Äù - Plague Cat VTuber
[1:54:06] <rajathene> Needs a cup of steamy coffee or something
[1:54:19] <locobo98> jezus
[1:54:20] <Applepie12421> what if the vtube breaks and we see your real face
[1:54:32] <Coystick> What about your Sonic Comic OC?
[1:54:43] <locobo98> he looks positively sinister
[1:54:47] <locobo98> i love him
[1:54:50] <$Livelinne> Was gone for a bit, and now there‚Äôs a cat Keepo
[1:55:02] <SaltkeyAndAckfish> loki
[1:55:09] <Coystick> He adorbs
[1:55:10] <locobo98> looks like garfield
[1:55:21] <%AzureSkyKnight> It looks like the grandchild of the other one you drew
[1:55:23] <SaltkeyAndAckfish> is that a straightjacket?
[1:55:41] <$Livelinne> psaBlep
[1:55:56] <%bettysharkface> Needs to be fluffier
[1:56:03] <+0ni0n_L0rd> Pfft
[1:56:22] <Coystick> I'm a slave, a slave to being cool
[1:56:31] <+stinkomeanie> Cats don‚Äôt wear chain chokers.

[1:56:49] <+kiwiredgrave> What? Plague is drawing a male furry?
[1:56:50] <rajathene> I still think you should just slap a black kitty ear headband on your head and call it good. Maybe give the look of a kitty nose with black 'face paint'.
[1:56:51] <locobo98> but youre hwite
[1:56:54] <Coystick> SlaveOfGripes
[1:56:58] <+Garden_Hills> Scarf?
[1:56:58] <+EpicBigchill> looks good as a first draft
[1:56:59] <%bettysharkface> Your farmer hat
[1:57:03] <+0ni0n_L0rd> Slave to the patreon wage! Put Plague in his patreon cage!
[1:57:07] <+spaghetti_shaman> To Be Continued
[1:57:08] <%AzureSkyKnight> STRAW HAT YES
[1:57:15] <+0ni0n_L0rd> Hat is a great idea
[1:57:19] <+stinkomeanie> Oh no is the streaming ending in To Be Continued before Plague says a racist joke
[1:57:44] <Coystick> I think a Cat in a Hat might be copywritten
[1:57:45] <KosOrSomeSayKosm_> it does look nice, but I wonder if it will be difficult to put different expressions on it since it's perma-grumpy
[1:57:49] <%bettysharkface> Farmer cat, farmer hat.
[1:57:58] <locobo98> STRAW HAT
[1:58:05] <+Hirvox> dunno whether facerig can turn a smile into a neutral expression
[1:58:07] <+stinkomeanie> Farmer cat actually would fit
[1:58:09] <locobo98> butt fluff
[1:59:32] <$Livelinne> Is this‚Äôll become Plague's facerig avatar?
[1:59:44] <%bettysharkface> Not sure about the string
[1:59:54] <+stinkomeanie> ‚ÄúHumans can‚Äôt be trusted to write its own history...also meow I guess‚Äù - Plague Cat
[2:00:43] <+thegreenbenis> Hey Plague, internet doing any better?
[2:01:18] <+thegreenbenis> Seems fine, but I dunno if that would be the same playing a vidya.
[2:01:51] <+thegreenbenis> Get a wife beater and heart boxers for the classic look.
[2:02:03] <locobo98> comfy
[2:03:16] <afraidanuffin> I feel like that chin could use more floof
[2:03:16] <KosOrSomeSayKosm_> yeah I'd pet it
[2:03:38] <+stinkomeanie> ‚ÄúDon‚Äôt tell me who I can‚Äôt sexualize, also I want a ball of yarn‚Äù
[2:03:57] <%AzureSkyKnight> Looks good
[2:04:24] <%bettysharkface> Internet droped again
[2:04:26] <locobo98> is he crouching?
[2:04:52] <locobo98> also this would make for a good plush
[2:05:03] <Rozalyndis> let's just say they're a bob-tail
[2:05:13] <%bettysharkface> Big tail big tail big tail
[2:05:15] <$cellularmishap> no you lost your tail during the war
[2:05:31] <%bettysharkface> Yeah!
[2:05:32] <locobo98> he tae his own tail
[2:05:35] <chainedwolfstress> Foof cat
[2:05:36] <locobo98> ate*
[2:05:38] <%bettysharkface> Big tail!
[2:06:05] <KosOrSomeSayKosm_> a monster huh....then it could also be a chimera. The front part still remains a cat but then there's all sorts of stuff going on in the backyard
[2:06:16] <locobo98> small face
[2:06:23] <locobo98> make the face super small
[2:06:30] <Rozalyndis> bobtails are so cute
[2:06:35] <%bettysharkface> I don't like the string on the hat
[2:06:56] <%bettysharkface> Bad string
[2:06:56] <Areus> triHmm
[2:07:01] <+stinkomeanie> *licks paw* you know nothing about Star Trek
[2:07:01] <Jey_Lince> plagueImoya plagueImoya
[2:07:11] <%bettysharkface> Yeah that's better
[2:07:29] <Daxalog> Would the whole thing be on screen? Or just the head?
[2:07:30] <%bettysharkface> I like the string behind like that
[2:07:38] <+Dragonsrule343> damn this turned from vtuber to fursona real quick
[2:07:46] <%AzureSkyKnight> Doesnt really need to make sense. Its a cartoon version of you as a cat
[2:07:51] <+Hirvox> sometimes you just gotta get petted to make the ends meet
[2:08:01] <%bettysharkface> Whiskers?
[2:08:13] <chainedwolfstress> I will run awaaaaay!
[2:08:15] <Killhooligan> what about orangutan plague
[2:08:31] <KosOrSomeSayKosm_> perfect
[2:08:32] <+Andele1503> And here i thought you wanted the ghibli demon uncanny valley
[2:08:34] <misterurbanthelegend> Put more bags around your eyes
[2:08:43] <%AzureSkyKnight> The real reason we are all here
[2:08:45] <Rozalyndis> is it a rabbit?
[2:08:47] <+illoonar> afoxinUhh sexula.... what?
[2:08:58] <misterurbanthelegend> back to wabbit
[2:09:05] <%bettysharkface> Ergghh but it's 1:20am
[2:09:22] <ahaegotrigger> why does the rabbits wealth matter?
[2:09:24] <+stinkomeanie> ‚ÄúHave you ever listen to the lyrics to this song about little girls?‚Äù - Plague Cat
[2:09:42] <KosOrSomeSayKosm_> nice acapella there
[2:09:57] <Rozalyndis> i have actually. "hush little baby, don't say a word. we're off to never never land"
[2:10:29] <Rozalyndis> enter sandman. which is euphemism for sleep powder
[2:10:35] <eventhesheepsays> Hello Plague "I'm not a furry" Gripes hktCOOKED
[2:10:47] <+Jamijji> I know I've seen plague expressing an interest in vtubers lately, so I figured I'd share that mori calliope has super chats now and she's made over $10,000 in 20 minutes
[2:10:57] <%bettysharkface> Jesus
[2:11:41] <Rozalyndis> there's a reason miku hatsune is incomprehensibly popular
[2:11:41] <KosOrSomeSayKosm_> I feel like flipped
[2:11:42] <%bettysharkface> Flipped
[2:11:43] <Coystick> Flipped

[2:11:43] <%AzureSkyKnight> Flipped
[2:11:43] <faykeyfake> flipped i dont know why
[2:11:46] <vladtet909> Flipped
[2:11:46] <idleclock> flipped
[2:11:46] <dirtyh4rr1> Flipped
[2:11:54] <+EpicBigchill> Flipp
[2:12:26] <%AzureSkyKnight> That's ok, others are doing it for you
[2:12:38] <Rozalyndis> well yeah. you don't talk in chat to talk to the streamer at that point
[2:12:47] <Rozalyndis> if you do then you're doing it wrong
[2:12:48] <%bettysharkface> Yeah, I caught most of the debuts live, but otherwise I just watch them whenever
[2:12:51] <%AzureSkyKnight> Kiara
[2:13:24] <dirtyh4rr1> one of many
[2:13:28] <kurinibay> nice art yo
[2:13:37] <KosOrSomeSayKosm_> it surprised me that all 5 of the en girls are really interesting personality wise
[2:13:38] <+mrdungeonsan> mrdung1Joy
[2:13:39] <Daxalog> "THE" pedophile song?
[2:13:48] <Cpl_Elemena> you talkin' about the EN Vtuber?
[2:13:57] <Coystick> Oh no
[2:14:01] <Rozalyndis> pattyYikes
[2:14:04] <%bettysharkface> Oh yeah I remember this
[2:14:05] <%Badpest> wait what? really?
[2:14:06] <DuoMaxwell64> :O
[2:14:07] <Coystick> Oh god no
[2:14:07] <Daxalog> Sssss
[2:14:08] <Cpl_Elemena> ooof
[2:14:09] <LunarRemix> It was okay in the time?
[2:14:10] <+EpicBigchill> He's creepin
[2:14:12] <+TheShisno> Industry is full of this
[2:14:12] <+stinkomeanie> It‚Äôs funny, everyone is going after you tubers over grooming little girls yet back then there were TONS of rockstars singing about fucking 15 year olds.
[2:14:18] <Rickbane> but best pedo song
[2:14:42] <+kiwiredgrave> Wasn't there another song that people accused of being pedophilic when it was actually about a man missing his daughter his wife took in their divorce?
[2:14:48] <+Ultimate_Edge> Sounds like a fit for that awful cutie movie
[2:15:08] <Rozalyndis> gross
[2:15:14] <%bettysharkface> Yeesh
[2:15:14] <Silshadnic> first time I join your stream and we talking about *this* song
[2:15:15] <Rozalyndis> grosser
[2:15:17] <dirtyh4rr1> oof
[2:15:23] <+TheShisno> YIKES
[2:15:23] <Rozalyndis> NO you've got to stop this
[2:15:30] <OminousBagel> That sounds like Twilight the Music Video
[2:15:31] <Daxalog> Incredible
[2:15:43] <+TheShisno> time to aliven't
[2:15:47] <Sunstalker> Stacey's Mom is also a kind of gross song that you gotta think about when you're older.
[2:16:00] <Cpl_Elemena> many fucked up songs are hidden behind a catchy tune
[2:16:07] <Panboy> and how is this song not getting banned when people want that christmass song banned
[2:16:09] <Coystick> No, Stacey's Mom is a global treaure
[2:16:09] <Rozalyndis> now i know what SRV's "leave my little girl alone" is about
[2:16:11] <Rozalyndis> HAH
[2:16:42] <Coystick> South Park summed it up best "niiiiice"
[2:16:57] <+TheShisno> Music encapsulates the human experience, for better or worse
[2:17:07] <Lixagon> looks like a dick LUL
[2:17:15] <+stinkomeanie> I ducking love this song
[2:17:17] <Sunstalker> Coystick Nah, the music video pushes it too far 'cuz those kids aren't even 14 yet or something.
[2:17:21] <Rozalyndis> looks like a tiara they can take off and throw like sailor moon
[2:17:26] <+stinkomeanie> For years I thought this was a culture club song
[2:18:09] <+stinkomeanie> I miss George Michael
[2:18:14] <Rickbane> but great failing marriage song
[2:18:15] <Silshadnic> Marge
[2:18:24] <%bettysharkface> Arnj merj
[2:18:58] <morcego_cinzento_arts> But i thought all marriages were an failure in themselves
[2:19:21] <Rozalyndis> common law marriage
[2:19:23] <Daxalog> tax reasons
[2:19:26] <+DoctorSquawk> Tax breaks
[2:19:45] <LunarRemix> wait what
[2:19:48] <chainedwolfstress> ..This playlist sounds like the exact one that Petco stores play. :0
[2:19:53] <LunarRemix> I'll you that I'm happy if you want me to
[2:19:54] <locobo98> tax reasons
[2:19:54] <Sunstalker> Yeah, that shit is bad over here in belgium cuz of christian hsitory
[2:19:57] <+stinkomeanie> My favorite argument for pro-gay marriage was always ‚Äúif they wanna be miserable with the rest of us then go for it‚Äù
[2:20:15] <%bettysharkface> Hahaha
[2:20:17] <chainedwolfstress> Ah, probably not that one then. XD

[2:21:49] <Coystick> Nah play Seventeen by Sharon Van Etten we can kill ourselves
[2:22:09] <%bettysharkface> Teens
[2:22:13] <morcego_cinzento_arts> Play that DreamTheater song about an guy murdering his wife and her lover and covering it up
[2:22:15] <%bettysharkface> Teens have girlfriends
[2:22:17] <+kiwiredgrave> i always thought the same
[2:22:21] <+Garden_Hills> Gulfwend
[2:22:38] <+kiwiredgrave> but i never thought of a different term that wasn't weird like "lover"
[2:22:49] <afraidanuffin> "partner"?
[2:22:56] <%bettysharkface> I was almost engaged once
[2:23:00] <afraidanuffin> "Significant Other" / "SO"
[2:23:01] <Mr_Strut> I figured plague was in some weird threeway relationship with pat and paige
[2:23:02] <%bettysharkface> It was weird
[2:23:12] <+kiwiredgrave> I guess, but that implies many different things and isn't personal enough
[2:23:38] <misterurbanthelegend> Have you tried prostitutes?
[2:23:44] <+kiwiredgrave> significant other is good. But it just sounds weird
[2:24:04] <dp4k> late teens earlier 20s it is super annoying cause it is hyper focused on relationships
[2:24:05] <morcego_cinzento_arts> i'm t6rying to imagine an teenager Eli with pimples and an full set of hair on his head
[2:24:13] <+Garden_Hills> I stopped eating taco bell for a few years and i no longer crave it. chemicals man. they got power.
[2:24:31] <dp4k> i can't just hang out with someone with out having 20 ppl tell me that i should date that person
[2:24:52] <+EpicBigchill> I'm about to cook some wings, ill send some to you Eli
[2:24:54] <+BiggusWingless> Wow you're on so early!

[2:26:00] <%bettysharkface> "Mother the light hurts"
[2:26:26] <locobo98> "this vessel is limmiting"
[2:26:30] <Sunstalker> So superior than Pat genes? kinamaList Got it.
[2:26:33] <+BiggusWingless> Some people pull off bald -really- well and you're definitely one of them. It looks super good on you

[2:39:30] <locobo98> plague do you ever intend to play DnD or some other tabletop
[2:39:42] <locobo98> i kinda feel like DM ing would be right up your alley
[2:40:04] <TheLemuroid> DM is definitely too much
[2:40:31] <%bettysharkface> There's a strangely large amount of D&D nerds in your discord.
[2:40:38] <TheLemuroid> Not DMing during covid was the best thing to happen to my health
[2:40:40] <locobo98> eh, hes a compentnet writer and draftsman, not to mention it helps not getting bored off of character

[2:58:01] <$Livelinne> I‚Äôm so out of touch with new pokemans
[2:58:08] <zamzoph> @PlagueOfGripes when you got your internet back after the Taokaka work, did you look up anything about her later on for further reference and find out that she's BlazBlue's biggest moron?
[2:59:13] <$Livelinne> raquelLit
[2:59:33] <+ConLin_Arts_> Taokaka was the reason I got Blazblue Calamity Trigger back in the day
[2:59:42] <nimu290> the kaka clan makes no sense
[3:00:50] <+jiggy_snipe> it was sampled in Peaches n Cream by Snoop Dogg
[3:00:57] <Coystick> The tune
[3:00:59] <zamzoph> Tao's absolutely my fav BB character. I'll forever be buttmad that she was effectively supplanted in everyone's mind by that stupid squirrel the moment she became playable..
[3:01:07] <%GenghisKhaner> New monhun stories game looks super cute, if nothing else
[3:01:10] <LunarRemix> It sounds like one of those songs that always shows up on '80s pop compilations but no one has it uploaded by itself
[3:01:14] <+stinkomeanie> Love this song. Always puts a spring to my step
[3:01:29] <Rozalyndis> is it bad that the parent trap is what made this song really stick in my head?

[3:10:25] <scorpio990> this song is bumping SingsNote
[3:10:30] <+stinkomeanie> I listened to the original, don‚Äôt know what Yung Bae changed in this
[3:10:56] <+jiggy_snipe> it was more upbeat it seemed
[3:11:03] <+DynoMyte08> YungBae's remixes are fuego
[3:11:09] <+DynoMyte08> y'all listen to Tatsuro Yamashita?
[3:11:19] <%JJCheeker> I always had more fun shading
[3:11:23] <+stinkomeanie> Listened to both, sounds nearly identical to me
[3:11:34] <+DynoMyte08> Ride on Time? Spacy? Mirai no Mirai? The man's a city pop genius
[3:11:47] <+DynoMyte08> listen to the live version
[3:11:53] <Fury_Curry> !music
[3:11:53] <laserbeaming> I like painting! I also suck at painting! Working on it though
[3:11:54] <+DynoMyte08> the live version of Ride on Time is phenomenal
[3:12:21] <LunarRemix> She's a really good singer
[3:12:27] <+DynoMyte08> youtube.com/watch?v=GIb3rPJjY9k
[3:12:33] <LunarRemix> To be able to sing while doing the cute-vtuber voice
[3:12:33] <+DynoMyte08> wait no, i was thinking of the live version of Spacy
[3:13:08] <@DCN2049> eh
[3:13:29] <Samex_Comex> Where is the Shark?
[3:13:35] <+DynoMyte08> it's such a good song
[3:13:38] <+democrazyyy> what's he drawing today?
[3:13:52] <mathbertoldo> Just came in from the wholesome simpfest that was Cali's stream. That was pretty good.
[3:13:58] <YakumoYomi> She sang "Koi"
[3:14:02] <+democrazyyy> ohhhh cinderace
[3:14:14] <Samex_Comex> Oh I guess I will check that out later
[3:14:27] <YakumoYomi> We made it rain SC on Calli. It was glorious.
[3:14:59] <bladewolf_7> Have you watched Hazbin Hotel?
[3:16:11] <mathbertoldo> For those who didn't catch it live, it's essentialy Cali having a slight meltdown after seeing all the colorful super chats, and then proceeding to try and fail to read each one, though she will try to do so over the next few streams or so.
[3:16:12] <%JJCheeker> was that Nintendo direct this morning a waste of time? i missed it
[3:16:45] <laserbeaming> There was a new Monster Hunter! And Hades Releases today
[3:16:50] <laserbeaming> Nothing else of note
[3:16:54] <YakumoYomi> She already did.
[3:16:55] <mathbertoldo> Kiara, yes.
[3:17:09] <+smevvster> You gonna draw your own live2d facerig, plague? PogChamp
[3:17:24] <The____Dave> New monster hunter! Sweetness
[3:17:45] <%GenghisKhaner> I thought the new trailer for Empire of Sin was pretty dope too, even if it's multiplatform
[3:18:00] <YakumoYomi> Kiara's first stream with SC enabled was earlier this morning. The next stream is her reading names, I believe.
[3:18:07] <mathbertoldo> She already did it though, that was her fast food debut. It was very amusing, seeing her and chat try to come up with menus and roles for the Hololive girls.
[3:18:08] <laserbeaming> I was already very aware of Empire of Sin
[3:18:17] <zamzoph> VoHiYo
[3:18:19] <sam_curtis> itty bitty comittee
[3:18:24] <laserbeaming> but the trailer was nice
[3:18:56] <YakumoYomi> I imagine Gura, Ina, and Watson's streams this evening will be SC enabled as well.
[3:19:05] <LunarRemix> Gosh this is so cute
[3:19:23] <KosOrSomeSayKosm_> bless gura
[3:20:15] <morcego_cinzento_arts> what song is this?
[3:20:16] <laserbeaming> feet
[3:20:19] <mathbertoldo> Gura, by the way, was assigned the cashier job in Kiara's fast food restaurant.
[3:20:29] <+smevvster> Ride on Time by Tatsuro Yamashita
[3:20:32] <YakumoYomi> Ride on Time, covered by Hololive EN's Gawr Gura
[3:20:42] <morcego_cinzento_arts> thanks smevvster
[3:21:12] <laserbeaming> Rwaide on Time
[3:21:35] <mathbertoldo> @morcego_cinzento_arts, you can find it at the end of her debut, or by just looking it up, there's tons of clips on Youtube.
[3:21:38] <+smevvster> I've been sitting on Yamashita's discography for years, and Japanese people are always blown away when I even say I know his music lmao
[3:21:55] <+IntrepidEye> love that little chuckled at that part
[3:22:03] <+DynoMyte08> I'm planning on finally taking a trip to japan next year
[3:22:04] <morcego_cinzento_arts> @mathbertoldo thanks
[3:22:05] <+DynoMyte08> Covid willing
[3:22:17] <+CatastropheCorvid> POCKET SAND!
[3:22:22] <+smevvster> Check out "Sparkle" by Yamashita if you dig the genre.
[3:22:25] <laserbeaming> wah
[3:22:25] <Coystick> She cheers for herself my heart
[3:22:26] <+smevvster> It's my fave.
[3:22:35] <+DynoMyte08> But hopefully it's cleared up and the japanese tourist industry does that reimbursement program
[3:22:50] <laserbeaming> she is adorable
[3:22:56] <+CatastropheCorvid> Ooh this one sounds funky.
[3:22:58] <LunarRemix> She's doing the best out of all of them
[3:23:00] <mathbertoldo> "That is me, desu."
[3:23:03] <+CatastropheCorvid> Your playlist is great.
[3:23:12] <+DynoMyte08> is this katana zero?
[3:23:17] <LunarRemix> IIRC yesterday she was doing so good that she triggered youtube's AI and it shadowbanned her
[3:23:24] <laserbeaming> The Plaguelist
[3:23:31] <+DynoMyte08> oh shit
[3:23:45] <+DynoMyte08> i haven't heard this yet but maccross plus is another great artist
[3:24:08] <+DynoMyte08> *82 - 99
[3:24:32] <+DynoMyte08> https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aOtlrlH-5Wk
[3:24:39] <+DynoMyte08> this feeling is probably my favorite song of theirs
[3:24:53] <mathbertoldo> @LunarRemix Huh, I haven't heard of it, was it like a very recent thing? Because I don't think she mentioned it on her Twitter.
[3:26:18] <zamzoph> AngelThump
[3:26:28] <YakumoYomi> Gura's the clear favorite of Hololive EN. I wouldn't be surprised if she ends up becoming as popular as Korone/Fubuki/Pekora
[3:26:40] <+Urgotfantasy> AngelThump
[3:26:40] <Coystick> Run 3 wen?
[3:27:12] <LunarRemix> I think she was unbanned right after, but during her stream she reached like 50K viewers and youtube's AI thought she was using bots and shadowbanned her, you couldn't search for her stream and it wouldn't show up on anyone's recommendation
[3:27:20] <Rozalyndis> my speedruns go haywire all the time
[3:27:22] <Sokumotanaka> you should try mortal shell

[3:29:39] <RunoEddie> PlagueVT when?
[3:29:58] <+grumpymonk242> I've had that problem
[3:30:01] <laserbeaming> Nintendo Online is probably one of the worst online services I've paid for
[3:30:05] <Rozalyndis> nintenDERP's netplay has always been horse shit
[3:30:42] <morcego_cinzento_arts> Don't let any japanese game company known taht we found an wa to not be oppressed by their refusal to give us better netcoding
[3:30:43] <Panboy> the best thing you can do to get around a not problem liek that plage is have your router give the nintendo your outside ip directly
[3:30:46] <@DCN2049> nintendo doesn't understand "online"
[3:31:10] <Rozalyndis> it's cuz nintendo is one of japan's oldest companies, and japan is incomprehensibly traditional
[3:31:10] <Panboy> sometimes the setting is called DMZ or ip pass thru
[3:31:15] <YakumoYomi> "Not developed here", eh?
[3:31:24] <Coystick> For the glory of nippon
[3:31:44] <laserbeaming> in software, there's a mantra of "don't reinvent the wheel" if someone already did it, use it
[3:31:46] <+arancet> the never ending roll back fiasco
[3:31:52] <@DCN2049> quantum internet
[3:32:00] <+Jamijji> it's probably a major part of why so many of them refuse to use rollback for their fighting games
[3:32:10] <faykeyfake> japanese fighting games all have unplayable fighting games
[3:32:12] <Coystick> That's why Quake code still in just about every 3D engine
[3:32:13] <LunarRemix> Japan "Let's invent adaptive AI" but not use rollback network
[3:32:15] <faykeyfake> netcode
[3:32:41] <Rozalyndis> do you do so because you don't know and don't wanna know new technologies? or is there an economical gap?
[3:32:42] <morcego_cinzento_arts> Japan truly is an tech hipster motivated by spite
[3:32:58] <KosOrSomeSayKosm_> PogChamp PogChamp
[3:33:07] <+arancet> spend the time keeping up with every single advance leaves you no time to have the experience to make anything well
[3:33:10] <Jey_Lince> plagueImoya
[3:33:11] <Panboy> i wish 3D was fast.. or maybe im just really slow at 3D v.v
[3:33:13] <faykeyfake> gg strive will have bad rollback watch
[3:33:34] <eventhesheepsays> plagueChirei
[3:33:52] <drefizz> nah it most likely wont Fay
[3:34:05] <faykeyfake> itll be another sfv situation
[3:34:06] <drefizz> they hired people who have experience with rollback iirc
[3:34:10] <mathbertoldo> You're right about 3D. Traditional animation just takes too long to do, which is why some animators seem to be jumping in the 3D cartoon wagon.
[3:34:11] <laserbeaming> 3D has a really long "ugly child" phase
[3:34:15] <+DakotaMacDoodle> Man I really wish Ultra instinct Goku's design was more than White hair
[3:34:18] <morcego_cinzento_arts> i really feel bad for the FGC. most of their games are japanese and they need to deal with Japan bs with netcoding
[3:34:26] <KosOrSomeSayKosm_> for strive they hired people who know what they are doing
[3:34:37] <drefizz> yeah
[3:34:39] <RunoEddie> @laserbeaming eh, I don't know, I've also run into a lot of software devs that would rather throw stuff in the trash and do it all from zero just because stuff isn't 100% to their liking
[3:34:41] <faykeyfake> were some american points out whats wrong with their shit and then theyll get defensive about it and refuse to fix it
[3:34:59] <drefizz> I can tell you it won't be
[3:35:22] <RunoEddie> @laserbeaming I had to rein some of these people in at various points during a few projects
[3:35:37] <hankistheguy> does anyone think Disney is in that phase where their 2d animation was flopping one after another?
[3:36:08] <faykeyfake> in an ideal world xrd would have rollback
[3:36:09] <hankistheguy> it feels like a bad streak kinda again
[3:36:22] <laserbeaming> @RunoEddie those are the people are dumb. Sometimes there's reasons to not use an already made solution, but 90% of the time they are being stubborn
[3:36:26] <faykeyfake> i know accent core is on fightcade now but its still in beta i think
[3:36:49] <mathbertoldo> @hankistheguy When was even the last 2D movie, or content in general, they did?
[3:37:07] <hankistheguy> the ast good one was the princess and the frog or the iron giant
[3:37:23] <bladewolf_7> What is your favorite pokemon?
[3:37:37] <drefizz> Iron Giant wasn't disney
[3:37:47] <hankistheguy> at the end of theirrenaissance
[3:37:52] <hankistheguy> uhhhhhhhh
[3:38:03] <Coystick> Cute hands
[3:38:05] <mathbertoldo> It's Warner, yes.
[3:38:10] <hankistheguy> Atlantis and treasure planet didnt do to well
[3:38:20] <hankistheguy> and some others
[3:38:28] <hankistheguy> until thay adopted 3d
[3:38:31] <Sunstalker> Hearing rumors of live action Disney Atlantis. kinamaFeelsbad They couldn't even treat the animated one right.
[3:38:43] <+DakotaMacDoodle> Anyone watch that CGI Lupin the Third Movie The animation was pretty amazing in that
[3:38:56] <hankistheguy> they put disrespect on mulan
[3:39:07] <mathbertoldo> I mean, those were pretty decent, but that was like last decade. 3D is just much more viable, money and time wise.
[3:39:09] <drefizz> I thought you said respect
[3:39:15] <drefizz> I was bout to throw hands LUL
[3:39:46] <hankistheguy> is it all animated on skeletons or whatever?
[3:39:49] <Coystick> feeEET
[3:39:59] <laserbeaming> feet
[3:40:22] <+theoriginalbigboy3535> Didn‚Äôt he used to do the art streams on...picario?
[3:40:22] <hankistheguy> i think the live-action stuff might be Disney trying to make cheaper movies, i need to do research on that
[3:40:51] <mathbertoldo> Picarto, yes, but more recently he's come back to Twitch.
[3:41:17] <laserbeaming> idk, I'm sure the CG animated Lion King that was advertised as "Live Action" was probably super expensive
[3:41:26] <hankistheguy> i tried using picarto to view streams but the ui isn't that good for me
[3:41:33] <mathbertoldo> @DakotaMacDoodle Would you recommend seeing Lupin out of context, or should I watch the old anime first?
[3:41:46] <laserbeaming> @hankistheguy you can use VLC to watch Picarto streams
[3:42:05] <hankistheguy> dammmmnnn
[3:42:17] <hankistheguy> 290 mil for the cg lion king
[3:42:31] <hankistheguy> and the 1994 one was some where in the 40s
[3:42:50] <Rozalyndis> my mother likes him
[3:43:01] <Rozalyndis> personally i find him boring
[3:43:02] <laserbeaming> even adjusted for inflation, it's a lot more
[3:43:22] <morcego_cinzento_arts> My dad is very big on songs like that
[3:43:51] <Rozalyndis> i'm not into the talking-as-singing form
[3:44:10] <hankistheguy> is there a song playlist
[3:44:24] <+DakotaMacDoodle> @mathbertoldo You can really jump in anywhere I'd recommend watching Lupin the 3rd: Castle of Cagliostro at some point tho its one of the best ones
[3:44:50] <SonofStranger> just make a playlist of every song ever
[3:44:59] <+EpicBigchill> Fleet foxes
[3:45:41] <Rozalyndis> what. classical? polka? reggae?
[3:45:49] <+jiggy_snipe> you never know, we might like it
[3:45:49] <+stinkomeanie> Winter Hymn is another Fleet Foxes song I like. Hell the whole album this song comes from is great.
[3:46:05] <morcego_cinzento_arts> and here i was being self concious about my spotify list being over 1300 songs
[3:46:09] <mathbertoldo> Country, anime, rap, he's got it all.
[3:46:33] <mathbertoldo> @DakotaMacDoodle Noted, thank you.
[3:46:36] <morcego_cinzento_arts> Plague has an very diverse taste
[3:46:42] <Coystick> Reminder Sturgil Simpson did an anime country concept album
[3:46:52] <RunoEddie> with Lupin you could really get into from anywhere, I started with Woman called Mine Fujiko and then went to the first Green Jacket series (early 70s)
[3:47:46] <morcego_cinzento_arts> Coystick he did, didn't he? i believe i saw one animated music video of his and there an netflix movie of it
[3:47:47] <derrick2239> whats the name of this song?
[3:49:07] <@Nightbot> Plague is a youtube animator and also streams at https://picarto.tv/Plague . Also: t-shirts! http://goo.gl/lze8QO
[3:49:48] <+DakotaMacDoodle> Only a fool limits what genres they listen to
[3:50:17] <Coystick> @derrick2239 Blue Ridge Mountain
[3:50:24] <RunoEddie> Plague, did you hear the podcast that Nyanners did yesterday?
[3:50:36] <+EpicBigchill> @PlagueOfGripes I think my favorite fleetwood mac song is the live version of Big Love
[3:51:44] <Coystick> Plain old vanilla Gypsy for me
[3:52:08] <mathbertoldo> J pop is pretty good, and recently I gave city pop a try as well.
[3:53:30] <SonofStranger> I'm not really that into rap or hip hop, but for some reason I've been listening to '80s and '90s gangster rap recently
[3:53:42] <Coystick> Every time I hear Fleetwood I always think of Tony Harrison from the Mighty Boosh
[3:54:13] <RunoEddie> it's pretty funny how Nyanners and Iron Mouse are so nervous to talk to each other because they are such big fangirls of each other
[3:54:40] <morcego_cinzento_arts> shy vs shy
[3:54:55] <mathbertoldo> @SonofStranger Speaking of...
[3:56:48] <rajathene> Are we going to listen to Calliope's rap from her debut too?
[3:59:47] <Samex_Comex> Poor Piccolo
[4:03:51] <+misticmotion> What happened to the chat?
[4:04:10] <SonofStranger> we all like plague's taste in rap music
[4:04:12] <Coystick> I got scared away by the n word
[4:04:23] <SonofStranger> and we're just vibing
[4:04:27] <gn0meb0ne> wow
[4:04:29] <gn0meb0ne> nathanDank
[4:04:44] <mathbertoldo> Chilling out while listening to tunes and keyboard sounds.
[4:04:58] <Teyaric> yo if this is your jam you given much Run The jewels time, Plague?
[4:05:03] <+misticmotion> cool, cool
[4:07:05] <laserbeaming> feet
[4:07:11] <gn0meb0ne> got that hobbit foot hair fade nathanDank
[4:07:14] <Coystick> Does the Pokemon actually use a soccer ball in battle?
[4:07:25] <LunarRemix> I just realized we didn't get any ads on this stream
[4:07:34] <LunarRemix> Wasn't Twitch supposed to roll out ads mid-stream?
[4:07:34] <gn0meb0ne> uh nathanZoomer sleighbells go so hard nathanZoomer
[4:07:59] <Samex_Comex> It takes a rock and makes a fireball to kick
[4:09:27] <Coystick> yeah that's clever
[4:10:14] <mathbertoldo> After the ammount of backlash they got from users on Twitter, I'm not they'll go on with that proposition, or maybe they will because greedy company like cash money.
[4:11:45] <RunoEddie> some people were MAD yesterday during the Sony event
[4:11:48] <+jiggy_snipe> LUL
[4:11:51] <RunoEddie> they got ads during the stream
[4:12:03] <Mr_Strut> good save
[4:12:10] <+jiggy_snipe> yea Twitch is gonna put ads mid stream now
[4:12:26] <+jiggy_snipe> the streamer could always hit the ad button but most don't while they are in the middle of something
[4:12:31] <SonofStranger> because amazon doesn't have enough money
[4:12:37] <Coystick> We should be allowed to say the n word in song
[4:12:53] <Samex_Comex> Why did he call me a biatch :(
[4:13:00] <evilkurac> whats dis song
[4:13:17] <Teyaric> You know, I traditionally had a very, very angry response to lines like "snitches get stitches". But the last few months made it clear. Don't play nice with the cops.
[4:13:42] <SonofStranger> yeah fuck cops
[4:13:52] <flamingmelon> :O
[4:14:14] <flamingmelon> ITS BLUUUUUUUD!
[4:14:17] <YakumoYomi> @Coystick I think EVERYONE should be able to say it. Relegating to a "bad" word only reinforces the idea that I (a black person) should be offended by it. Basically, I want it to be common to take the "sting" out of it as an insult.
[4:15:22] <mathbertoldo> As much as I want to support the streamers I like, I personally dislike a lot the concept of viewers getting ads during a live presentation.
[4:15:36] <morcego_cinzento_arts> remember when Will Smith had an nightmare with Doctor Dree?
[4:15:51] <Teyaric> So is this suppsoed to be a male or a female 'mon?
[4:16:24] <Coystick> @YakumoYomi Totally,bBut if we normalise it I won't be able to play n-chicken with my mates.
[4:16:28] <RunoEddie> the ads thing is also funny in the sense that Twitch buried the fuck out of Turbo, and that service removes ads for every streamer
[4:16:45] <RunoEddie> I didn't even know that existed
[4:17:11] <mathbertoldo> @YakumoYomi I mean, when the word's been around for centuries, it's hard to not think about the racial conotations it has while saying it.
[4:17:11] <cosmicgoatee> why does cinderace look like they're about to grab at something Kappa
[4:17:23] <Samex_Comex> The life of a G
[4:17:48] <Coystick> tbh I didn't mean to bring it up as a prominent topic.
[4:18:00] <Teyaric> @mathbertoldo Fer context - how'd you feel about someone calling you a slavery profiting oppressor?
[4:18:04] <$Livelinne> PridePog PridePog
[4:18:35] <Teyaric> the words may be 'meaningless' and 'misaimed' but they still suck and you know people only using them to be a dick
[4:18:38] <Artista_AF> Sports rabbit is looking adorably floofy PrideCute
[4:19:32] <+Hicksian> Hicksian subscribed with Twitch Prime. 
[4:20:19] <StreamStopA> Who did you have to kill to get your internet back?
[4:20:24] <mathbertoldo> @Teyaric You're right, yeah, though I think you misunderstood my point. To reiterate real quick, bad words and bad for some people, so normalizing them would not be quite a good idea for that particular crowd.
[4:20:45] <Coystick> I wish to be kicked by the rabbit.
[4:21:35] <Teyaric> @mathbertoldo All assuming you can get a homogonized, unified culture. It's a pipe dream. The next town over is gonna be different, let alone the next state. It's more about navigating between different contexts than trying to /set/ one context
[4:22:52] <Sunstalker> Fatboyslim kinamaHappyW
[4:23:10] <Teyaric> and therefor, personal respnsibility for how you behave in relation to what other people are gonna expect, rather than trying to change them - one of these approaches works, and is moral. the other is how facism happens, not to be too on the nose
[4:23:25] <mathbertoldo> Precisely. Context is very important when uttering certain words, specially jokes. You don't tell a bit about a guy getting hit by a hammer to a guy who got hammered in the face.
[4:23:32] <yet_another_brony> i have a cinderace plushie. she soft
[4:24:09] <+EpicBigchill> @PlagueOfGripes did you listen to the 5th anniversary concert for Undertale?
[4:24:12] <+misticmotion> Eat something!
[4:24:18] <yet_another_brony> cant you order a food
[4:24:26] <Teyaric> or, the guy is like that, and you double down on it - but someone who isn't in on it, has no connection, going for mallet based comedy is gonna be 'punching down' since they aint taken their licks to get integrated
[4:24:31] <yet_another_brony> oh its a real good concert
[4:24:40] <yet_another_brony> orchestral megalovania
[4:24:48] <+EpicBigchill> @PlagueOfGripes an orchestra did the entire album
[4:25:09] <+EpicBigchill> @yet_another_brony I didn't think Meglovania translated well, sadly
[4:25:23] <+EpicBigchill> A lot of it was really good tho
[4:25:27] <yet_another_brony> it was still pretty great
[4:25:41] <yet_another_brony> the people bobbing their heads as they played
[4:25:56] <mathbertoldo> The concert was decently made I suppose, I just wish they tried to change up the song a bit more, instead mot of them were note by note renditions of the game tracks.
[4:26:53] <mathbertoldo> Although that's coming from someone who spent hundreds of hours listening to amazing cover on Youtube.
[4:26:55] <yet_another_brony> the bait and switch when they played the annoying dog theme was also a good moment
[4:27:17] <+DoctorSquawk> That's a cute poke man
[4:27:37] <SonofStranger> oh no
[4:27:40] <SonofStranger> it's falco
[4:28:11] <Maleicus> that aint falco
[4:28:20] <+EpicBigchill> UH OHH
[4:28:36] <SonofStranger> austrian
[4:28:44] <cosmicgoatee> Austrian yeah
[4:28:49] <thealsian> Austria? Switzerland?
[4:28:53] <@Nightbot> Plague is a youtube animator and also streams at https://picarto.tv/Plague . Also: t-shirts! http://goo.gl/lze8QO
[4:29:01] <MelBrooksKA> The not Australia
[4:29:46] <$vampireinarm> do you color with the same brush you line with?
[4:30:09] <yet_another_brony> is this like a redesign like you did with delphox
[4:30:28] <yet_another_brony> ah
[4:30:31] <yet_another_brony> neat
[4:30:57] <$vampireinarm> ah ok, thanks
[4:32:17] <mathbertoldo> What a wholesome song to follow hardcore raps.
[4:32:37] <mellorolo> the pokemon bunny girl is coming together alright.
[4:33:09] <Rozalyndis> "have a good time... or we'll find you. we have a set of ball peen hammers in our car"
[4:34:52] <eventhesheepsays> yay the N word plagueChirei
[4:34:58] <+vedrisca> DAMN BOY THIS BUNNY GOT CAKE
[4:35:38] <Teyaric> And is also clearly a juvenile of the species. Relax~
[4:35:40] <$RC_S3kshun8> Hey all
[4:35:50] <$RC_S3kshun8> What kind of debauchery are we invested in today?
[4:36:09] <Maleicus> not my cheese
[4:36:51] <$vampireinarm> do you not mock new words you just learned others use?
[4:37:40] <laserbeaming> dating your stuff is good practice so the future can laugh at you
[4:37:48] <cosmicgoatee> Cinderace (M) DarkMode
[4:37:50] <mathbertoldo> @RC_S3kshun8 He was speaking a bit about vtubers earlier, the context is the recent debut of a new group of girls.
[4:38:59] <Rozalyndis> depends on the word entirely
[4:39:40] <Rozalyndis> like if someone's trying to totally justify the term "pwn" as a legit real word and substitution for "own" because they can't own up to the embarrassment of a typo?
[4:39:47] <Rozalyndis> yes, i will mock them and their stupid term
[4:40:22] <Rozalyndis> [/real etymology of the term "pwn"]
[4:40:32] <rainbowstory333> BALAN WONDERWORLD ON MARCH 26TH LETS GGGGGGGOOOOOOOOOOOO
[4:41:07] <mellorolo> @rozalyndis is "pwn" really a thing?
[4:41:14] <mellorolo> ???
[4:41:20] <Rozalyndis> hey eli is it cool to post links?
[4:42:06] <Rozalyndis> it's just a dictionary link
[4:42:11] <SonofStranger> language is a social construct. if people use a term and agree on its meaning, then it's valid equally valid
[4:42:23] <SonofStranger> language is a social construct. if people use a term and agree on its meaning, then it's equally valid
[4:42:26] <$RC_S3kshun8> @mathbertoldo Gotcha, thank you for explaining
[4:42:32] <Rozalyndis> sent privately
[4:42:38] <laserbeaming> pwn was a WoW pvp thing I think? I kind of associate it with Blizzard games
[4:42:43] <$RC_S3kshun8> @Rozalyndis 'pwn' vs 'own' has been a thing for going on decades now though
[4:42:53] <Rozalyndis> i know. that's how old i am
[4:43:03] <mathbertoldo> @Rozalyndis People make up words all the time, man. They can give meaning to something like lmao or lol.
[4:43:10] <$RC_S3kshun8> As are most of Eli's demographic, I would hazard to say.
[4:43:53] <Rozalyndis> colloquially used terms formed as acronyms. 's like nato or laser
[4:43:56] <$RC_S3kshun8> most of us IN Eli's Demographic*
[4:44:09] <Rozalyndis> both of those are acronyms for larger names
[4:44:36] <$RC_S3kshun8> NATO and laser began as Acronyms though. They don't acquire them later
[4:44:37] <mathbertoldo> With some exceptions here and there, yeah. Plague is in his 40s after all.
[4:44:46] <$RC_S3kshun8> He is?
[4:44:47] <$RC_S3kshun8> Huh
[4:44:51] <$RC_S3kshun8> I thought he was my age ish.
[4:44:59] <SonofStranger> yeah plague is a boomer
[4:45:04] <$RC_S3kshun8> Early 30s here
[4:45:21] <%AzureSkyKnight> 31 this Sat for me
[4:45:26] <$RC_S3kshun8> Also is Plague's audio super low?
[4:45:33] <$RC_S3kshun8> Had to crank my system audio to hear anything
[4:45:34] <mathbertoldo> Ah, forgive me then.
[4:45:49] <Rozalyndis> no *he's* just super quiet while he works
[4:46:14] <Rozalyndis> eli isn't the type to just... endless stream of consciousness
[4:46:26] <$RC_S3kshun8> No I get that
[4:46:41] <$RC_S3kshun8> I just meant I heard *something* and I realized the audio was super low for me
[4:46:47] <Rozalyndis> ah
[4:46:51] <$RC_S3kshun8> So I cranked up mine and I can faintly hear music now.
[4:46:58] <$RC_S3kshun8> Thus, didn't know if that was by design.
[4:47:10] <$RC_S3kshun8> No worries either way.
[4:47:36] <$RC_S3kshun8> Bless you
[4:47:38] <+misticmotion> First time watching you work, bless you

[4:47:47] <Rozalyndis> gesundheit
[4:47:50] <SonofStranger> the music is pretty loud compared to plague, but it doesn't matter much because plague isn't talking much
[4:47:50] <zaitje> Bless you

[4:48:04] <%Corluxis> Too bad you can't sneeze cutely like them Vtubers
[4:48:09] <mathbertoldo> Someone is talking about you.
[4:48:37] <nimu290> probably peach
[4:48:42] <+LordSDB> Hey its that jam!
[4:48:53] <+LordSDB> woolieCHAN
[4:48:55] <+grumpymonk242> so good
[4:48:57] <+misticmotion> My son creates NSFW animations, but of course I cant really watch him work...lol
[4:49:05] <Coystick> She lookin fine
[4:49:11] <@Nightbot> Plague is a youtube animator and also streams at https://picarto.tv/Plague . Also: t-shirts! http://goo.gl/lze8QO
[4:49:46] <Rozalyndis> nice melody
[4:49:55] <$RC_S3kshun8> Also, realized the audio issue WAS me.
[4:50:01] <$RC_S3kshun8> My browser was saying Twitch was at max audio
[4:50:15] <$RC_S3kshun8> However, I reloaded the browser and it was at like 10%
[4:50:21] <$RC_S3kshun8> Audio is normal now.
[4:50:23] <SonofStranger> that song had a pretty nice funk to it
[4:50:38] <$RC_S3kshun8> Thank you all for not attributing me insanity though.
[4:51:06] <terminusterminal> Lo-fi beats to study to
[4:51:12] <mathbertoldo> Speaking of vtubers, Plague, did you catch Peach's 2d avatar during one of her recent DS2 streams?
[4:52:43] <+CatastropheCorvid> I had to mute as I('m working, and I came back to FUNK.
[4:52:56] <+CatastropheCorvid> I need to catch more Plague streams.
[4:53:43] <+TopTierHarley> what did I walk into
[4:54:26] <Coystick> I would select kick bunny
[4:54:39] <+grumpymonk242> new we just need a big titty version and it'll be like all the post on e621
[4:54:40] <mathbertoldo> Not much going on usually, @CatastropheCorvid, it's just good to have in the background while doing something else, only occasionaly leaning in to check the comment section.
[4:55:47] <TheInnKeeper3> Honestly the last time I looked at the screen he was still doing the line art
[4:57:00] <+bumpyremi> I slept at 5am and now feel stupidly grog
[5:00:04] <Explodincatz> oh that was music, I thought it was a dumptruck in the background
[5:00:24] <+Drake377> what is best in life!?
[5:00:26] <Coystick> She looks like a kuudere
[5:01:19] <morcego_cinzento_arts> Is that from Conan the Barbarian?
[5:02:38] <LunarRemix> Man barbarian stuff died in the 90s
[5:03:51] <morcego_cinzento_arts> Last Barbarian thing that is more or less recent is Harry Patridge's Starbarians and some CG comedy movie about Barbarians
[5:04:01] <+TopTierHarley> Uh Dave the Barbarian tyvm
[5:04:33] <morcego_cinzento_arts> Dave the Barbarian and his two sisters, one an princess and the other an monkey
[5:04:50] <morcego_cinzento_arts> And his sassy, sarcastic talking sword
[5:05:40] <mathbertoldo> People got tired of muscly white men, I suppose, which is too bad.
[5:06:56] <morcego_cinzento_arts> Remember how Arnold's agent told him with his huge body he do never be an big start(at the 70's it wasn't the crave for big muscle in action movies) and he only got to fit in the role of Conan was cause of the muscles and his accent.....guess the tables fucking turned after conan cause onwards it was the 80's beefy muscle era
[5:07:34] <+DakotaMacDoodle> God this track rules
[5:07:57] <laserbeaming> I think I'll rewatch Conan the Barbarian
[5:08:04] <+misticmotion> Wow, thats an old one
[5:08:32] <+Jaysky> Which program are you doing this on Plague?
[5:08:35] <Coystick> It's funny you can see how DBZ characters thinned out over time too, Goku was a beeflord in the saiyan saga
[5:08:45] <+misticmotion> 1966
[5:09:14] <YakumoYomi> Was Hercules in New York before the Conan movies?
[5:09:18] <+Jaysky> Nevermind I spot it
[5:09:21] <mathbertoldo> @Jaysky I believe it's Paint Tool Sai, but I've been wrong before in this stream.
[5:09:59] <dingdangwiggly> Yeah, it's Sai 2
[5:10:00] <Coystick> I like the soft shadows
[5:10:02] <+Jaysky> Thanks mathbertoldo , I was fullscreened and the icon was blocking the top right. Program shows up top there.
[5:10:05] <morcego_cinzento_arts> Was DeathStalker before or after Conan?
[5:10:10] <+Jaysky> Err, top left
[5:10:37] <$Livelinne> PridePog PridePog PridePog
[5:10:58] <$Livelinne> aw cutie raquelLove
[5:11:27] <mathbertoldo> @YakumoYomi By the use of quick searching skills, I can tell you that Hercules in New York is from 1970, while the first Conan is from 1982.
[5:11:50] <mathbertoldo> DeathStalker came a year after.
[5:12:26] <YakumoYomi> Ah, thank you.
[5:12:35] <+toungie> oho. free art AND singing lessons here?
[5:12:46] <morcego_cinzento_arts> thanks Math
[5:13:14] <+Kyoshikei> TwitchUnity
[5:14:30] <+EpicBigchill> Love this song
[5:14:41] <+Kyoshikei> PrideUwu yaaaaaaaaas
[5:14:42] <laserbeaming> this is probably my favorite song from that game
[5:14:45] <+EpicBigchill> The orchestra did it proper
[5:14:48] <ralphwiggum16> Hello Plague
[5:14:57] <ralphwiggum16> I've come to talk to you about magic and goblins.
[5:14:58] <+EpicBigchill> Its actually called "Undertale", the song that is
[5:15:16] <YakumoYomi> Undertale~
[5:15:29] <$Livelinne> raquelThump raquelThump
[5:16:01] <laserbeaming> it plays during what I think is the best moment in the game. I love it
[5:16:06] <mathbertoldo> After working on a music mod, you get so used to the covers and remixes that you forget what the original sounded like.
[5:18:03] <ralphwiggum16> are you drawing this for Kell?
[5:19:08] <+Jaysky> The problem with that moment in the game is that these random monsters are just coming outta nowhere to tell you this lore dump
[5:19:27] <+Jaysky> Everything up to that point felt organic
[5:20:19] <ralphwiggum16> my problem with undertale is it doesn't have enough goblins
[5:20:20] <ralphwiggum16> 2/10
[5:20:40] <Explodincatz> you play as one
[5:20:45] <ralphwiggum16> oh yeah
[5:20:48] <ralphwiggum16> 3/10
[5:20:55] <$Livelinne> LUL
[5:21:17] <LunarRemix> Hope he doesn't go too far with the edge stuff on Deltarune
[5:21:32] <LunarRemix> edgy*
[5:23:09] <mathbertoldo> I want it to be even edgier. The main character should have a gun in the next chapter, also a trenchcoat.

[5:29:30] <ralphwiggum16> what song is this
[5:29:34] <ralphwiggum16> it's on the tip of my tongue
[5:29:52] <+AKAMarkTwain> @ralphwiggum16 It's Linkin Park
[5:30:05] <+toungie> you reap what you sow or something?
[5:30:32] <$Livelinne> grymSHRED
