[0:01:13] <+BlitztankStation> I am so so sorry Plague
[0:01:29] <Triblade1992> Hello
[0:01:40] <+BlitztankStation> My mind somehow confused you with Seth Everman for a moment and when I saw you I was like "Woah he has hair?!"
[0:02:04] <whittacre> plague you've changed so much
[0:02:15] <laserbeaming> Plague has more hair now, it seems
[0:02:33] <Triblade1992> Plague of Gripes has really changed. What's up with the hairdo
[0:03:20] <+BlitztankStation> poor doggies
[0:03:50] <laserbeaming> They're evil Ninja Doggies
[0:03:56] <laserbeaming> probably
[0:05:13] <Too_Much_Nukie> Too_Much_Nukie subscribed with Twitch Prime. 
[0:05:21] <+MrSargent90> greetings everybody
[0:06:14] <%Too_Much_Nukie> It's stuck on epicnamebro for me
[0:06:20] <GhostPyre> Same
[0:06:36] <laserbeaming> "Numerous technical difficulties but maybe it'll hold together" He said on twitter, seems like it didn't hold together?
[0:07:06] <@Nightbot> Plague is a youtube animator and also streams at https://picarto.tv/Plague . Also: t-shirts! http://goo.gl/lze8QO
[0:07:12] <GhostPyre> It somehow says he's live but also hosting someone at the same time.
[0:07:15] <%Too_Much_Nukie> Seems like some people didn't pray for today's stream :/
[0:07:40] <+bagool3058> if I don't get my furry bait soon, I'm gonna, I'm gonna!
[0:07:42] <+thegalvanicpanic> there we go
[0:07:43] <GhostPyre> there we go
[0:07:44] <%Too_Much_Nukie> Now it's working.
[0:07:48] <laserbeaming> Hey, it works now
[0:07:48] <whittacre> hey plague!
[0:07:53] <ThisGamingDragon> "That furry game" fuck off plague
[0:07:53] <Triblade1992> Hello Plague!
[0:07:59] <TheOverwhelmingShotgun> howdy there folks
[0:08:01] <Jeemukun> eyy spyro time
[0:08:08] <%Too_Much_Nukie> Nope!
[0:08:12] <laserbeaming> Furry Game quiettOwO
[0:08:14] <whittacre> love that side banner
[0:08:15] <%Too_Much_Nukie> This game has the most abrupt story.
[0:08:23] <+MrSargent90> That looks new to me, the intro I mean
[0:08:32] <laserbeaming> Spyro doesn't get much of an introduction
[0:08:36] <QuietteShy> yeah i couldnt watch ur stream for like 10 minutes, it sent me to a host instead
[0:08:37] <SpookyFluidz> Hey Plague. Can't wait for the lore run of SPYRO!
[0:08:37] <Jdrockefeller> don't listen to the dragons green man, you beautiful
[0:08:40] <Dao_Puppy> This has only been on for about 15 seconds.
[0:08:43] <Triblade1992> It started with Epicnamebro
[0:08:45] <ThisGamingDragon> Spyro is a simple game, Plague.
[0:08:46] <SoFarFetched> nope none of us did.
[0:08:49] <TheOverwhelmingShotgun> nope
[0:08:53] <whittacre> sure didn't
[0:08:53] <Exadata_> hey its that game that inspired all those images online that make me feel uncomfortable
[0:09:00] <laserbeaming> you were talking into the void
[0:09:07] <Dao_Puppy> Spray your face again to show what happened!
[0:09:07] <JailShmixRemix> Yes
[0:09:08] <SoFarFetched> I believe so.
[0:09:13] <QuietteShy> yeah i could watch the vod
[0:09:16] <Triblade1992> @PlagueOfGripes I believe so
[0:09:18] <TheOverwhelmingShotgun> runtime says 9 minutes and 20 seconds, but the first 9 minutes are just you hosting epicnamebro
[0:09:18] <$SGrim> Possible
[0:09:19] <+Garden_Hills> yah
[0:09:20] <SpookyFluidz> nah fuck it
[0:09:24] <Dumple_Roe> for 2 weeks
[0:09:24] <SpookyFluidz> just make it a mess
[0:09:30] <SpookyFluidz> itll be better that way
[0:09:30] <%Too_Much_Nukie> This game also has like some kind of chosen one story in the background that's never really fully explained. Multiple dragons hint at Spyro being super important but I think they never go into it in this game.
[0:09:36] <%IceAge70> IceAge70 subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 16 months, currently on a 15 month streak! Plague of Spyro
[0:09:36] <+jacewolf_is_the_best> oh my, its him
[0:09:37] <+silvery_cricket> 25 hours
[0:09:40] <$pennykettle_> afaik vods dont appear until 1hr after the thing happens. so if a stream goes for 2 hrs you can only see the 1st hour so far
[0:09:56] <SoFarFetched> So went to the thing,it seems to show you from the very beginning.
[0:09:57] <Dao_Puppy> Oh yeah, I can go back in the recent vids.
[0:10:00] <$SGrim> The vod starts at your intro screen
[0:10:02] <laserbeaming> I love Spyro's idles
[0:10:03] <JailShmixRemix> Checked, the vod shows the beginning of your stream
[0:10:04] <Tunykun> it shows me 10 mins
[0:10:05] <Triblade1992> I think so
[0:10:05] <TheOverwhelmingShotgun> yes
[0:10:08] <+ThomasOfTroy> Yep
[0:10:12] <afronooch> yeah pretty much
[0:10:13] <laserbeaming> seems like you did the intro for no one
[0:10:13] <Jeemukun> good job twitch
[0:10:16] <SoFarFetched> It still shows in the stream thing,when I we nt to look at "recent broadcasts"
[0:10:18] <Triblade1992> fuckin twitch
[0:10:21] <herecomesmong0> yup
[0:10:37] <SoFarFetched> so it shows your outro.
[0:10:38] <ThisGamingDragon> Plague why are you suddenly interested in the best video game to ever exist?
[0:10:42] <+SirGO0SE> love you too :)
[0:10:43] <SoFarFetched> intro*
[0:11:04] <cap_bon> its a very nice looking remake so far
[0:11:13] <Triblade1992> yeah, PS1 wasn't very good with the whole "lets introduce our new franchise".
[0:11:15] <SpookyFluidz> All you need to know about spyro is that he is the player character
[0:11:16] <ThisGamingDragon> Spyro is a game that needs no introduction.
[0:11:19] <+Garden_Hills> Purple dragon dildo the character
[0:11:22] <laserbeaming> You're a young purple dragon, and that's as much depth as you're gonna get
[0:11:24] <@PatStaresAt> yo this stream smels
[0:11:29] <QuietteShy> hey its a game from 1998, they couldnt fit the character introductions the disk back them
[0:11:30] <SoFarFetched> gottem
[0:11:31] <SpookyFluidz> sick combat rolls
[0:11:33] <%Too_Much_Nukie> The weird intro isn't a remake thing btw, the original game has basically the same intro but with LESS information.
[0:11:45] <ThisGamingDragon> think of this game like spongebob.
[0:11:46] <Zebroneath> The intro was like that in the original too. I guess because game booklets introduced the character for you before playing.
[0:11:57] <cap_bon> you little bitch wings arent strong enough to fly LUL
[0:12:00] <%Too_Much_Nukie> Yeah they expected you to read the game manual.
[0:12:13] <QuietteShy> QuietteShy gifted a Tier 1 sub to PatStaresAt! This is their first Gift Sub in the channel! 
[0:12:15] <+MrSargent90> Hey Plague, I went to rewatch the og spyro one and that random tv intro stuff was on it, same as you no exposition of who is who
[0:12:33] <%Too_Much_Nukie> Look at this gay furry bait.
[0:12:34] <laserbeaming> Get the strangely attractive dragons
[0:12:39] <ThisGamingDragon> Dragons, Plague.
[0:12:40] <+zooeymainbtw> scalie game
[0:12:40] <+jt427> touched dragon tips ez
[0:12:41] <BlkFlameKami> yes
[0:12:44] <%Too_Much_Nukie> It sure is!
[0:12:47] <cap_bon> wait is spyro naked
[0:12:50] <Triblade1992> you touched him and he says "Do my job for me!"
[0:12:51] <Futurecity10> OH BOY FURRY SHIT
[0:12:52] <+Garden_Hills> Now fuck off and let me do absolutely nothing to help
[0:12:59] <%Too_Much_Nukie> Do not question objective Spyro.
[0:13:00] <Meowbringer> do video game!
[0:13:01] <Coystick> Oh boy time for wholesome dragon adventures in the land of short skirted fairies
[0:13:03] <SoFarFetched> I assume replay the scene
[0:13:06] <Zebroneath> All these dragon friends are fucking lazy
[0:13:09] <jellssssss20> replaying that video lol
[0:13:10] <+zooeymainbtw> oh you know
[0:13:11] <whittacre> it means rewatch dragon
[0:13:11] <ThisGamingDragon> Plague have you seriously never played a ps1 game before?
[0:13:11] <%Too_Much_Nukie> Spyro 2 and 3 have proper stories but this game is just video game.
[0:13:16] <Pouch_cotato> "go do shit for me"
[0:13:19] <$pennykettle_> plague playing my childhood? Oh boy
[0:13:20] <Triblade1992> "We could help you, but we are lazy fucks" - Dragon boi to Spyro
[0:13:21] <Futurecity10> hey plague, there is a mod for this game that just makes spyro super fat
[0:13:22] <Coystick> Kill all orcs
[0:13:23] <whittacre> spyro 1 is trash, spyro 2 is best FITE ME
[0:13:34] <kingra> The fuck is the sidebar?
[0:13:35] <+zooeymainbtw> Next game
[0:13:35] <$pennykettle_> yea spyro 1 is super barebones, 2 and 3 have full story setup
[0:13:36] <+Draylle> Spyro, you must trigger the event nodes
[0:13:37] <%Too_Much_Nukie> Spyro 2 is the best, I will not fight you.
[0:13:42] <+Garden_Hills> just a glide
[0:13:46] <Meowbringer> you'll get to the plane sections
[0:13:49] <$pennykettle_> yes spyro 2 is best, no brawls here
[0:13:50] <SpookyFluidz> this game is a hard ass ps1 game reamke. basically the only change is the minimap and a minor climb they gave spyro in case you fuck up a long glide
[0:13:52] <+MrSargent90> the ships are HP points you recover
[0:13:54] <laserbeaming> in this level, yes
[0:13:55] <Dao_Puppy> Hey I was lied to, the can sprayed everywhere else, not your face. The fantasy is dead.
[0:13:56] <Doublemint_Dave_> Hello plague how are you
[0:14:03] <PierrotPlays> I remember loving this game as a kid
[0:14:11] <Coystick> I've been playing Ghost of Kurosawa Mode so this color is giving my eyes diabetes
[0:14:12] <jellssssss20> i think there's an additional button press to get a bit higher at the end of your jump I believe, will it tell you? who knows
[0:14:15] <TheLucidChiba> This is a pretty laid back game, my sister played it but had me beat anything she found tough way back
[0:14:24] <Coystick> 2 & 3 have lore
[0:14:29] <AetherNightmare> Dragons are basically cats that breathe fire.
[0:14:30] <ThisGamingDragon> Plague doesn't like dragons, everyone.
[0:14:31] <laserbeaming> I wouldn't blame you for starting at 2
[0:14:47] <%Too_Much_Nukie> Spyro 1 is also missing a lot of game features they add in 2 to vary up gameplay.
[0:14:53] <ThisGamingDragon> Plague didn't have a childhood, confirmed.
[0:15:08] <Triblade1992> Crash, not so much Plague. Crash was a legit platformer
[0:15:10] <Coystick> I love Spyro's run animation
[0:15:11] <%Too_Much_Nukie> Yeah I loved Spyro as a kid but the first game is hard to go back to.
[0:15:12] <Meowbringer> video game!
[0:15:15] <jellssssss20> Single A? A-minus?
[0:15:17] <+MisterRockett> You just described all Mario games, Plague xD
[0:15:19] <BlkFlameKami> do number gain progress
[0:15:23] <$SGrim> Get 10 to go to next NUMBER
[0:15:24] <%Too_Much_Nukie> Nope.
[0:15:24] <cap_bon> Mascot platformer the video game
[0:15:25] <ahaegotrigger> yep LUL
[0:15:26] <+zooeymainbtw> game it up
[0:15:26] <+Scevda> Is this the first stream for this?
[0:15:27] <kingra> This is a VIDEO GAME
[0:15:30] <laserbeaming> V I D E O G A M E
[0:15:31] <PierrotPlays> LUL
[0:15:32] <%Too_Much_Nukie> MAKE NUMBER GO UP
[0:15:39] <ThisGamingDragon> It is pretty good lore for a kid's game.
[0:15:41] <Zebroneath> Similar to Banjo Kazooie back then
[0:15:41] <SilverRoddo> Scalies
[0:15:43] <$pennykettle_> You don't even know, the NPC's in the original would audibly say "Press the X button to glide!" and stuff like that
[0:15:43] <+jt427> pure pretty collectathon
[0:15:52] <laserbeaming> that was a 1 up I think
[0:15:53] <$SGrim> You killed that poor amn!
[0:15:53] <Coystick> His claws even make the doggy crackle noise ahh
[0:15:54] <jellssssss20> He presented himself to you
[0:15:57] <$SGrim> man*
[0:15:59] <%Too_Much_Nukie> Hold square/x to ram btw. It makes you run fast and stab with horns.
[0:15:59] <v__max> Rescue dragon and get excited for next dragon
[0:16:02] <funwashere> VIDEO ASS VIDEO GAME
[0:16:07] <ThisGamingDragon> I don't know what you were expecting, Eli.
[0:16:11] <Coystick> It's an old ass video game man
[0:16:20] <jellssssss20> Was this ps1?
[0:16:22] <+Scevda> Thanks Eli, hope you enjoy it.
[0:16:28] <+RadicalPirate> I remember playing Spyro on my PS1 many moons ago
[0:16:29] <Coystick> This was demo disc childhood
[0:16:32] <%Too_Much_Nukie> Yeah this game was "Let's make a 3D platformer with product we can market."
[0:16:36] <Triblade1992> The difference between Spyro and Crash is that Crash was made as a legitimate platformer. That's why Naughty Dog became so famous
[0:16:39] <$pennykettle_> health bar
[0:16:40] <ahaegotrigger> oh while youre flying hit R1 and L1 to barrel roll
[0:16:41] <jellssssss20> Your health
[0:16:42] <+zooeymainbtw> your health
[0:16:43] <SpookyFluidz> he points twoard gems
[0:16:44] <ahaegotrigger> its your health
[0:16:47] <Coystick> That's the final boss
[0:16:48] <%Too_Much_Nukie> The reason you're freeing dragons is so they have a bunch of toys to release.
[0:16:54] <+nooseygoosey> Rip and Tear
[0:16:55] <Doublemint_Dave_> Man spyro isn't as fuckable as sonic
[0:16:55] <ThisGamingDragon> His color indicates how many hit points you have.
[0:16:58] <Daxalog> The dragonfly was your HUD
[0:16:58] <+Garden_Hills> its color tells you your health
[0:17:00] <SpookyFluidz> plague you gotta read the manuel! DUH!
[0:17:10] <drargon> you'r health
[0:17:11] <+zooeymainbtw> there is not, also don't forget charge
[0:17:15] <Coystick> Oh my god you killed that Dark Souls protagonist
[0:17:16] <%Too_Much_Nukie> Every dragon you free in this world will give tutorials.
[0:17:18] <$pennykettle_> every dragon has a dragonfly! its da rules
[0:17:25] <Daxalog> We need a HUD that a child can understand and like
[0:17:25] <ahaegotrigger> idk sony
[0:17:27] <+Draylle> the answer to any question you have is "because Video Games"
[0:17:32] <laserbeaming> Armored enemies can be headbutted with Square
[0:17:32] <SilverRoddo> His(?) dragon gallop is nice.
[0:17:37] <jellssssss20> I dunno, Spyro probably has that cloaca
[0:17:37] <%Too_Much_Nukie> Spyro is a boy yes.
[0:17:49] <SpookyFluidz> nah this game is super basic but in a good way. its just a fun game. nothing deep
[0:17:55] <$SGrim> Gems are for MORE collecting
[0:17:56] <+zooeymainbtw> gems just collectables
[0:17:57] <ThisGamingDragon> I feel like you're doing yourself a disservice by not playing the original PS1 versions first, Eli.
[0:17:57] <cap_bon> jesus no wonder the dragons were turned to jade you guys are genocidal monsters
[0:17:58] <ahaegotrigger> gems are money they let you "buy" things
[0:18:00] <%Too_Much_Nukie> RIP
[0:18:00] <Firemane1279> Spyro is a male. in canon at least. Kappa
[0:18:08] <$pennykettle_> I wish they increased the level size in the remake to modernize it a bit
[0:18:18] <whittacre> there are no other powers
[0:18:21] <whittacre> just charge & fire
[0:18:23] <%Too_Much_Nukie> This game has no upgrades or abilities, that's something they added in 2.
[0:18:23] <+zooeymainbtw> nope
[0:18:28] <jellssssss20> Lol "getting a new item or something" good luck
[0:18:30] <QuietteShy> this is truly the dark souls of dragon simulators
[0:18:32] <SilverRoddo> Ah, thank y’all LuvSign
[0:18:33] <TheyCallMeVawn> Gems help you unlock levels and other things, but theyre mostly there as collectables.
[0:18:34] <Coystick> Remember that time they tried to make Spyro Lord of the Rings and he was Frodo and Sauron was Mark Hamil?
[0:18:46] <$Rezca> Rezca subscribed with Twitch Prime. They've subscribed for 5 months! 
[0:18:55] <%Too_Much_Nukie> You need a certain amount of gems/dragons/eggs to unlock worlds.
[0:19:00] <$pennykettle_> Oh and the furrybait started in 2 I think
[0:19:03] <BlkFlameKami> USE ACTION BUTTON
[0:19:04] <+Garden_Hills> You rescued Seath the Bitch
[0:19:05] <Triblade1992> LOL
[0:19:08] <ahaegotrigger> the ACTION Button
[0:19:09] <%Too_Much_Nukie> Triangle/Y
[0:19:10] <%Too_Much_Nukie> LOL
[0:19:11] <Firemane1279> @coystick I rememba. it was a decent game.
[0:19:11] <Dakuu75> lol
[0:19:11] <ahaegotrigger> LUL
[0:19:11] <Triblade1992> This is why Crash is better
[0:19:13] <+whiskywolfe> You've freed Albi, the Racist Dragon!
[0:19:13] <SilverRoddo> That orc needs to build a better dakka.
[0:19:14] <SpookyFluidz> Fuck that dragon lol
[0:19:14] <AlanJoestar> V I D E O G A M E
[0:19:16] <TheyCallMeVawn> Dont talk to Spyro like that :(
[0:19:16] <kingra> LEAVE 😡
[0:19:16] <+zooeymainbtw> no you love it
[0:19:17] <cap_bon> thanks for telling us the video game thing
[0:19:21] <jellssssss20> Why was that first one wearing clothes and this one only had a necklace
[0:19:23] <laserbeaming> The game has no dialogue changes, it's as it was on PS1
[0:19:28] <$pennykettle_> I LOVE the 4th wall breaking
[0:19:31] <DehiDehi> It’s only fury to non believers
[0:19:31] <+arancet> plague, aren't YOU supposed to be wearing that spyro costume?
[0:19:35] <%Too_Much_Nukie> Yeah this game is painfully loyal.
[0:19:39] <SilverRoddo> Oh?
[0:19:42] <$pennykettle_> Spyro you have to press the O button to breathe fire
[0:19:45] <SpookyFluidz> the dragons have clothes based on what world theyre from. theyre all different
[0:19:54] <+zooeymainbtw> cuck Dragon
[0:19:58] <Coystick> @Firemane1279 David Spade was your healthbar
[0:20:03] <ThisGamingDragon> Now, I feel like I'm wro g for wanting more games to be like this.
[0:20:04] <%Too_Much_Nukie> Every single dragon is a unique character. It's toyetic.
[0:20:05] <cap_bon> are spyro 2 and 3 less video game?
[0:20:11] <Samex_Comex> Aww yeah!
[0:20:11] <%Too_Much_Nukie> Yes.
[0:20:12] <laserbeaming> yes
[0:20:20] <%Too_Much_Nukie> 2 and 3 have big storylines and lore.
[0:20:24] <jellssssss20> yes
[0:20:25] <+RadicalPirate> don't doubt yourself
[0:20:29] <+RadicalPirate> BELIEVE IN YOURSELF
[0:20:33] <%Too_Much_Nukie> They're improvements over this game in every way.
[0:20:36] <QuietteShy> but it does looks kinda pretty
[0:20:41] <%Gogogolem> Gogogolem subscribed with Twitch Prime. They've subscribed for 10 months! 
[0:20:56] <SilverRoddo> Jobb-orcs
[0:20:59] <Coystick> Hamlord defeated
[0:21:03] <laserbeaming> Lock-on wasn't a common thing back in the PS1
[0:21:03] <$pennykettle_> there are two camera options in settings, can't remember which is better
[0:21:05] <Samex_Comex> Fuck em up!
[0:21:07] <+zooeymainbtw> don't forget your charge attack
[0:21:13] <%Too_Much_Nukie> Yes.
[0:21:14] <+zooeymainbtw> ye
[0:21:14] <laserbeaming> yes
[0:21:14] <QuietteShy> yes
[0:21:15] <whittacre> butterflys are heath
[0:21:16] <Coystick> Murder all woodland critters
[0:21:16] <$pennykettle_> you murder small critters to regain health
[0:21:16] <+Scevda> That came after OoT got popularp
[0:21:17] <jellssssss20> that refills your already full health, yeah
[0:21:19] <+Garden_Hills> yes
[0:21:19] <ahaegotrigger> that wouldve been a heal if you didnt have full health
[0:21:21] <ahaegotrigger> yes
[0:21:21] <v__max> Yes to both
[0:21:26] <%Too_Much_Nukie> Any defenseless creature you kill drops a butterfly, butterflies refill health.
[0:21:28] <Zebroneath> Consume to sustain
[0:21:30] <+zooeymainbtw> you kill small animal for health
[0:21:30] <+Garden_Hills> kill animals to make butterflies to get health, Duh
[0:21:36] <QuietteShy> you murder for health you CONSUME THEIR SOULS TO EXTEND YOUR OWN LIFE
[0:21:37] <%Too_Much_Nukie> Each level has different defenseless creatures.
[0:21:39] <drargon> that it did
[0:21:41] <%Void_The_Dark> @PlagueOfGripes the firefly color represents your health
[0:21:47] <Coystick> Don't look up her skirt twitchban
[0:21:49] <ahaegotrigger> no
[0:21:51] <jellssssss20> Is it?
[0:21:56] <$pennykettle_> dont forget Eli, in the original, there was no analogue sticks, so you used shoulder buttons to rotate camera SirMad
[0:21:59] <%Too_Much_Nukie> I think you missed some collectibles.
[0:22:00] <ahaegotrigger> unlock the chest its for this level
[0:22:05] <DehiDehi> Fairy kregasm
[0:22:17] <+zooeymainbtw> technically it's all you have to do, you can go around and get more gems
[0:22:18] <Coystick> He fly
[0:22:20] <drargon> it changes
[0:22:26] <laserbeaming> I think you can press Select to see how many collectibles you have
[0:22:26] <Triblade1992> Again, this is why Crash Badicoot is better
[0:22:27] <+thegreenbenis> Ocarina had lock on
[0:22:29] <Doublemint_Dave_> I hate his dumb face
[0:22:31] <Coystick> Look how gayly he runs
[0:22:32] <Kurudan> This is nostalgic as hell
[0:22:33] <EuropanLamprey> Spyro is a VTOL
[0:22:36] <+zooeymainbtw> @triblade1992 facts
[0:22:38] <Futurecity10> spyro 1 is really short, I would suggest trying to collect everything for this game only
[0:22:59] <%Too_Much_Nukie> Yeah charging takes some practice to control.
[0:23:02] <cap_bon> arent there like 4 zones in this game
[0:23:12] <Triblade1992> @zooeymainbtw Yeah, there is a reason why Crash was the mascot of PS1 era and what made Naughty Dog famous
[0:23:20] <jellssssss20> No how could I know?
[0:23:23] <Kurudan> Because he NEEDS to
[0:23:25] <ahaegotrigger> perfect timing
[0:23:25] <Coystick> My only piece of advice is fuck all levels labeled "Speedway"
[0:23:29] <+Chester_goes_Berserk> these big dragons are so laaazy
[0:23:30] <$SuperAmadeus14> Cheer100 whats poppin
[0:23:35] <SirFancySwank> solve the waterfall puzzle
[0:23:37] <+thegreenbenis> Health bar
[0:23:38] <%Too_Much_Nukie> Wasn't Sparx retconned to be a girl in later games?

[0:23:39] <+bagool3058> Use context clues Plague, you're a big boy.
[0:23:40] <+Garden_Hills> figure it out you dipshit kid
[0:23:44] <cap_bon> Stop asking questions while he explains video game
[0:23:49] <jellssssss20> "Use your eyes and you might see it!"
[0:23:54] <%Gogogolem> Not whats more disturbing is he is wearing a belt and no pants.
[0:23:58] <%wolf34736> wolf34736 subscribed with Twitch Prime. 
[0:24:05] <+bagool3058> He's a crystal lizard.
[0:24:07] <$pennykettle_> the belt is for... attachments @Gogogolem
[0:24:26] <ThisGamingDragon> If you're a fan of the originals, you know there's a lot wrong with this remake.
[0:24:29] <%Too_Much_Nukie> Wait until you see the boss fights in this game.
[0:24:29] <Jinrya_Geki> @plagueofgripes I'm sorry if you asked a bajillion times, you try -The Surge-?
[0:24:31] <jellssssss20> He'll obviously turn colours when you get hit
[0:24:33] <Jdrockefeller> 100 dragon dad's and 100 pieces of non help to moldy helpful advice
[0:24:36] <+SinisterBroccoli> murder to refill health
[0:24:37] <Doublemint_Dave_> Dont kill the sheep D:
[0:24:44] <%Too_Much_Nukie> Yes.
[0:24:45] <+sleepy_rinea> yes
[0:24:46] <Kurudan> Ya
[0:24:46] <SpookyFluidz> yeah its cute
[0:24:47] <+Chester_goes_Berserk> just animal violence
[0:24:48] <ahaegotrigger> yeah youre a dragon
[0:24:49] <$pennykettle_> lol burnt to a crisp
[0:24:50] <laserbeaming> kinda
[0:24:52] <+Scevda> You know, sheep things
[0:24:53] <ThisGamingDragon> YES. it's the 90s.
[0:24:55] <+zooeymainbtw> yes
[0:24:55] <Triblade1992> I believe the sheep is killed for a trophy in this """"remake""""
[0:24:55] <kingra> Yes
[0:24:56] <+bhp_99> yeah, video game
[0:24:57] <+thegreenbenis> Kinda
[0:24:58] <v__max> Kids LOVE the small videogame animal murder
[0:25:00] <laserbeaming> they might be assholes
[0:25:02] <Coystick> I want to eat the Chocolate Cornet on his tail
[0:25:06] <%Too_Much_Nukie> Yeah each level has different defenseless creatures. And yeah in-universe dragons are assholes.
[0:25:06] <$pennykettle_> No the dragons are loved, the plot of 3 is that the world is dying because the dragons left
[0:25:06] <ahaegotrigger> Dragons are always horrid assholes even as heroes
[0:25:08] <%Void_The_Dark> you can reach that i think
[0:25:09] <jellssssss20> They were frozen for the good of every other population
[0:25:14] <cap_bon> its to show dragons superiority to all other creatures
[0:25:16] <sendart> dergens gonna dergen
[0:25:19] <ThisGamingDragon> Spyro is cool cuz he's a predator.
[0:25:21] <%Too_Much_Nukie> In Spyro 2 they have more lore about dragons being assholes everyone is afraid of.
[0:25:21] <+SinisterBroccoli> So the dragons are like the Lions in lion king?
[0:25:24] <+zooeymainbtw> you can,it's kinda finicky though
[0:25:25] <Samex_Comex> The commercials was Spyro murdering sheep
[0:25:33] <Jdrockefeller> the commercial was all about a disgruntled sheep complaining about how spryo burns them
[0:25:37] <ThisGamingDragon> Crash Bandicoot tortures and kicks chickens.
[0:25:41] <+Garden_Hills> and now boss
[0:25:41] <Coystick> Is he just eating a whole Watermelon?
[0:25:43] <Exadata_> spyro is one of those games that I remember playing but forgetting it had a story
[0:25:44] <%Too_Much_Nukie> Boss level.
[0:25:48] <SirFancySwank> boss time
[0:25:49] <+TheEvaFreak> hungry
[0:25:50] <ahaegotrigger> LUL
[0:25:52] <+zooeymainbtw> do boss now loser
[0:25:53] <+sleepy_rinea> gnasty gnorc froze all the dragons because they insulted him on national tv
[0:25:53] <kingra> Yes
[0:25:53] <cap_bon> who?
[0:25:54] <%Too_Much_Nukie> Yes.
[0:25:54] <$pennykettle_> its water weight
[0:25:56] <+thegreenbenis> Why don't you have a watermelon? @PlagueOfGripes
[0:25:57] <+whiskywolfe> He's the racist dragon.
[0:25:59] <+Garden_Hills> i hate these "bosses"
[0:26:00] <jellssssss20> why was he taking bite's of it like an apple?
[0:26:00] <Kurudan> Um
[0:26:03] <Daxalog> Theyre all themed around "something"
[0:26:04] <Coystick> At least slice the watermelon first fuck
[0:26:05] <Jdrockefeller> he hungry
[0:26:05] <sendart> sex toy
[0:26:06] <ThisGamingDragon> They tried to make all the dragons in the remake have different personalities.
[0:26:07] <+NickHatesSnow> Hey Plague and Chat
[0:26:07] <$daveronald> adds depth to the character
[0:26:09] <+Chester_goes_Berserk> Roasty is a hype level iirc
[0:26:11] <%Too_Much_Nukie> Plague you keep asking questions and then answering them yourself immediately.
[0:26:12] <+zooeymainbtw> sup
[0:26:13] <BlkFlameKami> What if you forgot tho
[0:26:13] <+Scevda> For watermelon things...
[0:26:19] <ahaegotrigger> replay it if you want LUL
[0:26:26] <cap_bon> ps1 mascot platformer stop thinking and be excite for video game
[0:26:26] <Jdrockefeller> just roll with it
[0:26:27] <$pennykettle_> the dragon designs are all unique to the remake so they wanted you to see them more than 1 time aech
[0:26:28] <+TheEvaFreak> Most of these details on the dragons wasn't in the original
[0:26:30] <Coystick> I just noticed the man above plague
[0:26:39] <+zooeymainbtw> don't forget to at least every dragon per stage
[0:26:41] <+RadicalPirate> oh god
[0:26:41] <+SirGO0SE> wonder how long itll take for plague to have more streams than paige this year LUL
[0:26:43] <Futurecity10> sometimes a dragon working at subway is just a dragon
[0:26:50] <Daxalog> Or small?
[0:26:50] <+Prince7ohn> eski66Oppai
[0:26:56] <Jdrockefeller> or is spryo tiny
[0:26:56] <%Too_Much_Nukie> Yeah the dragons in the original were all unique but very limited by the technology of the time.
[0:26:56] <Coystick> Oceanmelon
[0:27:02] <SilverRoddo> He likes to hollow out watermelons, to, you know, 🍆
[0:27:02] <Kurudan> This is my first time seeing your face Plague. Its surreal putting a face to the voice now.
[0:27:03] <$daveronald> no compare it to the dragon fly's
[0:27:08] <%Too_Much_Nukie> Yeah Spyro isn't very large.
[0:27:13] <+RadicalPirate> I thought Spyro was just a babby dragon
[0:27:16] <jellssssss20> is that a normal sized dragonfly or a giant one?
[0:27:23] <Coystick> Spyro is dog size
[0:27:23] <@Nightbot> Plague is a youtube animator and also streams at https://picarto.tv/Plague . Also: t-shirts! http://goo.gl/lze8QO
[0:27:24] <%Too_Much_Nukie> Spyro is like 10 years old or something.
[0:27:27] <+thegreenbenis> The dragons were super limited appearance wise.
[0:27:31] <+zooeymainbtw> yup
[0:27:31] <Firemane1279> spyro is pretty lorge when you think about it.
[0:27:32] <Daxalog> Spyro is probably dog sized?
[0:27:32] <%Too_Much_Nukie> Yes.
[0:27:33] <+TheEvaFreak> ye
[0:27:34] <$pennykettle_> Toes and TEETH
[0:27:35] <+MisterRockett> There's no attention to scale here the Dragons are probably 7-8 feet tall.
[0:27:35] <ThisGamingDragon> He's the size of a large dog.
[0:27:37] <Coystick> He has little beetle claws
[0:27:37] <ahaegotrigger> LUL yes
[0:27:39] <Futurecity10> Basically yes, you only need dragons to progress
[0:27:39] <+thegreenbenis> So he can land
[0:27:39] <Triblade1992> yeah, but you can use it to """"buy"""" stuff
[0:27:41] <jellssssss20> DRAGON fly
[0:27:45] <%Too_Much_Nukie> He has dragon claws.
[0:27:50] <Jdrockefeller> yeah you can 100% the jewels in the level
[0:27:53] <laserbeaming> I think it's colored fingers
[0:27:54] <SirFancySwank> its a collectathon game
[0:27:55] <cap_bon> the sheep in this game arent nearly stubborn or suicidal as real life sheep LUL
[0:28:12] <Coystick> Those are his mating graspers he uses to fu-
[0:28:16] <+thegreenbenis> @PlagueOfGripes There are birds with teeth and bills.
[0:28:18] <+OnwardEch0> real sheep are suicidal?
[0:28:31] <%Void_The_Dark> See ya
[0:28:31] <weissguard> LUL
[0:28:33] <BlkFlameKami> based spyro
[0:28:33] <$pennykettle_> hes got 90s spunk
[0:28:35] <JonnyJug> Hahah
[0:28:35] <ahaegotrigger> LUL
[0:28:36] <ThisGamingDragon> This is like a dream come true. First Plague makes a Sonic OC, Now he's playing Spyro!
[0:28:36] <%Too_Much_Nukie> I REJECT YOUR LORE
[0:28:46] <Coystick> "In the age of ancients, the world was..."
[0:28:46] <+zooeymainbtw> NO LORE
[0:28:46] <Jdrockefeller> no time old man
[0:28:47] <SilverRoddo> I need lore!
[0:28:49] <AlanJoestar> Rip Dragon Deckard Cain
[0:28:52] <Jinrya_Geki> is spyro supposed to be a wyrmling?
[0:28:54] <jellssssss20> Fuck you and the lore you didn't write
[0:28:55] <SirFancySwank> jump off the side by the exit portal
[0:28:58] <ThisGamingDragon> Spyro wasn't nearly that mean with that line in the original.
[0:28:59] <london_flexing> YOUR LORE DIES WITH YOU OLD MAN
[0:29:01] <+Scevda> Wanna know about this brick wall here?! Fuck no!
[0:29:02] <$pennykettle_> fuck the elderly, I wanna go skateboard! Its the 90s!!
[0:29:02] <%Too_Much_Nukie> Spyro is a baby wyrm.
[0:29:09] <ahaegotrigger> yeah he does
[0:29:11] <+BurkeBigsby> Lore is for lil cocksucka's.
[0:29:12] <%Too_Much_Nukie> 100%
[0:29:14] <+zooeymainbtw> He is very much a sonic
[0:29:19] <%Too_Much_Nukie> This game was trying to ride Sonic's coat tails.
[0:29:22] <$pennykettle_> LUL
[0:29:24] <%Too_Much_Nukie> No it's not.
[0:29:24] <ahaegotrigger> thats a thief
[0:29:25] <Kurudan> Thats not the dragon fly
[0:29:26] <+Scevda> That was the trend at the time....
[0:29:26] <kingra> LUL
[0:29:27] <SaltyDavid> That's not spark
[0:29:27] <Futurecity10> No thats not the fly
[0:29:27] <+Garden_Hills> gotta go fast
[0:29:28] <+TheEvaFreak> that isnt sparx
[0:29:28] <Kurudan> thats the thief
[0:29:28] <+thegreenbenis> Thief
[0:29:28] <%Too_Much_Nukie> That's an egg thief.
[0:29:29] <Samex_Comex> Oh no the egg stealer
[0:29:29] <+zooeymainbtw> lol
[0:29:30] <SilverRoddo> The Doom of Spyro, screw the story.
[0:29:32] <+Scevda> It wasnt pretty.
[0:29:32] <weissguard> Keep looking.
[0:29:34] <laserbeaming> No, that's an enemy offscreen
[0:29:35] <jellssssss20> "I could have shot myself while frozen like that for years but i saved the gun for this very moment, my life's meaning was to tell you that lore"
[0:29:35] <+Chester_goes_Berserk> spyro gets a skateboard in 3, it's rad
[0:29:35] <+thegreenbenis> That's a thief.
[0:29:36] <Coystick> No no no, that is the siren song of THEM
[0:29:37] <ThisGamingDragon> 90s kid character acts like 90s kid character.
[0:29:37] <Triblade1992> Pretty much. Spyro is too much built up on nostalgia. Crash had quality behind it
[0:29:43] <$daveronald> but sounds like johnny test
[0:29:47] <%Void_The_Dark> @PlagueOfGripes nah, it's an offscreen enemy making that noise
[0:29:47] <$pennykettle_> nah fuck yall spyro is better than crash
[0:29:47] <+thegreenbenis> That wasn't the dragon fly.
[0:29:49] <%Too_Much_Nukie> SHEEP LORD
[0:29:58] <+zooeymainbtw> true
[0:29:59] <+MisterRockett> That's just straight up a human, huh?
[0:30:03] <Jinrya_Geki> i never played the spyro games.
[0:30:05] <%Too_Much_Nukie> Yes.
[0:30:07] <TheyCallMeVawn> Couldnt even control the camera in the original
[0:30:09] <+BurkeBigsby> I thought you were gonna say anyone over the age of 12
[0:30:09] <Jinrya_Geki> I'm a heathen
[0:30:16] <jellssssss20> Hit with head!
[0:30:18] <%Too_Much_Nukie> Those sheep herders are just humans.
[0:30:18] <Coystick> Patches
[0:30:22] <Jdrockefeller> smash with face
[0:30:23] <+zooeymainbtw> egg thief
[0:30:23] <Kurudan> egg thirf
[0:30:24] <+TheEvaFreak> a theif
[0:30:25] <ahaegotrigger> its a thief above you
[0:30:25] <JonnyJug> What indeed
[0:30:26] <+MisterRockett> A thief. They're around here somewhere.
[0:30:28] <laserbeaming> An enemy just above you
[0:30:30] <%Void_The_Dark> enemy on the roof @PlagueOfGripes
[0:30:32] <ahaegotrigger> taunting you
[0:30:34] <%Too_Much_Nukie> It was an egg thief, they're like Aladdin characters you have to chase.
[0:30:38] <+Scevda> I would kind of love to see you play Banjo Kazooie
[0:30:39] <Doublemint_Dave_> Spyro is babby game
[0:30:49] <Coystick> Demon on the roof
[0:30:54] <ThisGamingDragon> Just like Mario!
[0:30:56] <+Vestillion> spyro is BEST babby game
[0:30:57] <+zooeymainbtw> yup
[0:30:57] <ahaegotrigger> yes
[0:31:01] <Triblade1992> bad guy gets taunted by asshole dragons. Now free the asshole dragons by playing as a little asshole dragon.
[0:31:02] <+Vestillion> I'll fite you irl
[0:31:02] <%Too_Much_Nukie> The dragon will tell you
[0:31:05] <$pennykettle_> The 2nd game is so good because it has a main plot and each world has its own story and worldbuilding, albeit small
[0:31:05] <jellssssss20> They probably just leaned into the no-plotness for the remaking
[0:31:09] <Coystick> Greatbrush
[0:31:13] <Coystick> Chaos Greatbrush
[0:31:14] <%Void_The_Dark> It's Eli
[0:31:14] <jellssssss20> GoldAss?
[0:31:15] <Shadope342> wheres yours eli
[0:31:15] <+Scevda> Sail!
[0:31:18] <Samex_Comex> He needs a giant Wacom
[0:31:19] <kingra> Look at my HUGE BRUSH
[0:31:23] <SirFancySwank> it is the artisan world
[0:31:28] <ahaegotrigger> Action button to EAT SHIT mid flight
[0:31:29] <%Too_Much_Nukie> I don't think you ever need to use the drop-down in this game.
[0:31:36] <cap_bon> Plague wheres your giant art brush
[0:31:38] <Coystick> Look at fairy hips tho
[0:31:39] <DehiDehi> I have a giant brush on these dragons
[0:31:39] <+Scevda> Fuck you I wont do what you tell me!
[0:31:45] <Exadata_> plague were is your giant brush and apron covered in paint?
[0:31:46] <ahaegotrigger> this is exactly what the game was though
[0:31:52] <laserbeaming> None at all
[0:31:52] <+MisterRockett> They made the dragons fucky but there's no lady dragons at all and that's distressing.
[0:31:53] <ThisGamingDragon> It hurts how much Eli doesn't know about 90s game design.
[0:31:55] <+NotSoAccurateNo1> welcome to spyro
[0:31:59] <MissHedgey> They continue to talk like that the entire game.
[0:32:00] <%gupa5240> its not that deep lol
[0:32:02] <%Void_The_Dark> But Eli, as an artiest you always say press the A button
[0:32:06] <whittacre> the story is the bad guy turned all the dragons into crystals. the end
[0:32:06] <Sol_Install> yoyo
[0:32:08] <trixterDeVil> is it because this was for kids?
[0:32:15] <%Too_Much_Nukie> Zelda was also for kids.
[0:32:16] <+BurkeBigsby> Make jumps and collect jewels. What more do you need?
[0:32:18] <Jdrockefeller> nah some dude butt hurt about being called ugly
[0:32:24] <Jdrockefeller> and you gotta clean up
[0:32:24] <$pennykettle_> These dragons eventually run out of things to say
[0:32:24] <+Vestillion> sometimes all that story gets smothering and you just wanna run around as a dwagon
[0:32:24] <+MisterRockett> That was like, the 5th LoZ game this is their first. Give them a break.
[0:32:28] <Coystick> It's a mascot platformer temper your expectations
[0:32:29] <jellssssss20> Pay? Writers?
[0:32:30] <%Too_Much_Nukie> It is time for the most annoying enemies in this game.
[0:32:31] <Doublemint_Dave_> Man, Ocarina of Time is so good
[0:32:31] <Triblade1992> yeah, Crash at least EXPLAINED how Dr. Cortex created Crash and his bandicoot girlfriend.
[0:32:32] <Sol_Install> is this a furry? wouldn't this be more Scaley?
[0:32:36] <+OnwardEch0> man goes hollow playing games for kid
[0:32:39] <trixterDeVil> deeper than push the button
[0:32:40] <ahaegotrigger> deeper than mud?
[0:32:40] <laserbeaming> I was an 8 year old boy when I played this!
[0:32:42] <@CrankyVT> Even in 2 and 3 the story is next to nothing
[0:32:44] <Futurecity10> its dry
[0:32:46] <SilverRoddo> We’re applying what we’ve learned.
[0:32:49] <ahaegotrigger> LUL fair
[0:32:51] <KaiserMario> It's like this was made for Mike "I don't give a shit about story, just give me game" Matei
[0:32:52] <ThisGamingDragon> Spyro is the Dark Souls of video games
[0:32:52] <SpookyFluidz> yeah fuck you for wanting story
[0:32:54] <tolloponik> it was probably in that instruction Booklet that came with the game
[0:32:55] <Shadope342> its draining your lore knowledge of other games
[0:32:56] <Coystick> It's less Zelda, more Crash Bandicoot
[0:33:01] <+Scevda> Now you see why OoT resonated so much, shit ton of games didnt do that basic things like that.
[0:33:06] <DehiDehi> Grim dark Spyro dark souls fan fiction
[0:33:06] <+Garden_Hills> sonic?
[0:33:09] <+SirGO0SE> are you implying shallow? LUL
[0:33:11] <MissHedgey> Imagine all the dialogue with the Taco Bell Chihuahua voice too, for a more authentic experience.
[0:33:17] <trixterDeVil> is your sprint infinite? jeez
[0:33:18] <MissHedgey> Since Tom Kenny didn't step in until 2.
[0:33:22] <+MrSargent90> oh! you just wait for later lvls
[0:33:23] <+NickHatesSnow> Rachet & Clank is when Insomniac really got into there story stuff
[0:33:25] <KellBeII> o/ hi eli
[0:33:26] <jellssssss20> Get that booty
[0:33:27] <Coystick> Huh, I wonder if they made him blue as a Son the Hedge jab?
[0:33:38] <%Too_Much_Nukie> He did.
[0:33:39] <ThisGamingDragon> Rocko did the original voice.
[0:33:39] <ahaegotrigger> yes
[0:33:40] <SilverRoddo> Spryo world is in a Gundam space colony? LuvPeekR
[0:33:40] <trixterDeVil> oh the jukes
[0:33:40] <$pennykettle_> you can flame him when you get close
[0:33:41] <Sol_Install> yep
[0:33:46] <Jinrya_Geki> i wonder what his top 5 favourite games are, to understand what games he likes?
[0:33:48] <$pennykettle_> Clap
[0:33:53] <ahaegotrigger> Nice
[0:33:55] <Doublemint_Dave_> Prey Slaughtered

[0:34:08] <+Vestillion> he thiefs eggs
[0:34:08] <CrmznOgre> Hey plague mind if I ask a art com question?
[0:34:20] <+MisterRockett> It's fun when they make one of those a cute bunny rabbit in theeeee third game?
[0:34:21] <KaiserMario> Do dragons have cloacas? Where's the GapingDragon cloaca?
[0:34:23] <Zebroneath> Where are all the female dragons?
[0:34:24] <%Too_Much_Nukie> There is stuff up on the ledge.
[0:34:29] <ahaegotrigger> how about the castle
[0:34:30] <jellssssss20> They need that slave race to bear they eggs, how'd you guess the lore?
[0:34:39] <%Too_Much_Nukie> That's a map boundary Spyro!
[0:34:56] <MissHedgey> Um, the existence of dragon eggs in this game contradicts the lore of Spyro 3 about dragon mating rituals. I can't believe they didn't fix that blunder.
[0:34:59] <+jt427> pretty color, nice music. no brain. its great for chill time
[0:35:00] <Coystick> This is a good "catch up on something in the background" game
[0:35:00] <MissHedgey> Hope someone got fired for that.
[0:35:09] <SilverRoddo> You can’t go there, not allowed.
[0:35:10] <$pennykettle_> keeps out the titans
[0:35:10] <kingra> Aliens
[0:35:12] <Cyral_Drive> magic
[0:35:19] <SpookyFluidz> This IS NOT the dark souls of anything for sure
[0:35:20] <%Too_Much_Nukie> Aliens ARE canon after all.
[0:35:23] <+Garden_Hills> the force
[0:35:24] <%gupa5240> keeps gwyn and his asshole knights out
[0:35:25] <KaiserMario> When are going to find Seath?
[0:35:26] <+Vestillion> the lore is: shut up, play the video game
[0:35:26] <Triblade1992> Don't know. Like I said, Spyro has no depth in this game. It's anti depth
[0:35:33] <Firemane1279> LORE chat. Kappa LUL
[0:35:34] <JonnyJug> lol
[0:35:36] <+Scevda> Lord gwyn banished them to this realm.
[0:35:40] <laserbeaming> Videogame!
[0:35:41] <ahaegotrigger> yes
[0:35:42] <$pennykettle_> at one point theres an enemy thats a middle eastern man who throws bombs from his flying carpet, named Bombo LUL They changed that in the remake
[0:35:47] <ThisGamingDragon> Having fun, Plague?
[0:35:53] <%Too_Much_Nukie> You need to find a key for those.
[0:35:55] <SirFancySwank> need key
[0:35:56] <jellssssss20> just do better
[0:36:00] <Triblade1992> Gavin!
[0:36:03] <jellssssss20> hit it harder
[0:36:07] <jellssssss20> no lol
[0:36:08] <+TheEvaFreak> no
[0:36:09] <$pennykettle_> hipsterdragon PogChamp
[0:36:11] <ThisGamingDragon> MOUSTACHE
[0:36:13] <Coystick> But why the coffee
[0:36:25] <MissHedgey> This game's redesigns make me uncomfortable.
[0:36:29] <jellssssss20> he can breathe fire
[0:36:30] <Triblade1992> maybe he is a dragon that likes cold coffee
[0:36:35] <+dowmein> me on the left
[0:36:35] <kingra> It was hot when he turned into a statue
[0:36:35] <MissHedgey> They had SO much fun making all the dragons into hot daddies.
[0:36:37] <Coystick> What theme is bara-coffee man
[0:36:39] <SpookyFluidz> yechnically, the dragons DO tell you things about the game when you save them but its pretty weird
[0:36:40] <JonnyJug> Only lukewarm coffee
[0:36:43] <Jdrockefeller> can just boil it in his gullet
[0:36:45] <Firemane1279> man drinks his coffee COLD. LUL Kappa
[0:36:47] <ThisGamingDragon> I like the original dragons all being the same model better.
[0:36:48] <Cyral_Drive> It was hot before he turned and froze him in time
[0:36:55] <Futurecity10> needs a key
[0:36:56] <%Too_Much_Nukie> You need to find a key hidden in the level. It's just gems.
[0:36:58] <jellssssss20> longer run up
[0:37:02] <SirFancySwank> find a key
[0:37:08] <jellssssss20> is it a key chest, ahh
[0:37:11] <SilverRoddo> Charge fire?
[0:37:14] <MissHedgey> In the leadup to the game's release, they were so proud of the dragons, and put them in the credits for all three games, even though they're only in 1.
[0:37:15] <Coystick> It's a mimic
[0:37:19] <@CrankyVT> only in the world you get it in
[0:37:19] <+sleepy_rinea> keys are level specific
[0:37:22] <laserbeaming> you found a key in another level, it's only for that level
[0:37:23] <MissHedgey> They were so proud of their daddy dragons.
[0:37:24] <+TheEvaFreak> you can only use in the world you get it in
[0:37:24] <%Too_Much_Nukie> They're level specific yeah.
[0:37:25] <Triblade1992> I believe you can only use it in the world you get it in
[0:37:31] <ThisGamingDragon> Actually the Dragons are collectibles that explain the lore.
[0:37:37] <@CrankyVT> Typically there's only one locked chest at most in a level iirc
[0:37:47] <$pennykettle_> LUL your faces
[0:37:52] <+Vestillion> metal things can't be burned
[0:37:58] <Coystick> Plague is breaking
[0:37:59] <SirFancySwank> not as thick
[0:37:59] <KellBeII> oh hey cranky
[0:38:03] <+MisterRockett> More chains
[0:38:04] <$pennykettle_> magic lock
[0:38:04] <%Too_Much_Nukie> Yeah I don't think there's any level where there's two keys.
[0:38:06] <JonnyJug> It's a very sturdy lock
[0:38:08] <cap_bon> becuase locks are magic
[0:38:08] <+Vestillion> they have to be broken with your noggin
[0:38:09] <+jt427> ps1 graphics i guess
[0:38:12] <Triblade1992> Vidya Gaem
[0:38:14] <MissHedgey> A wizard did it.
[0:38:16] <ThisGamingDragon> Because it has chains on it duh
[0:38:18] <Coystick> Hi vegeta
[0:38:19] <KaiserMario> Don't ask questions, consume product
[0:38:19] <%Too_Much_Nukie> Are ya winnin son?
[0:38:20] <+mezz44> I chalk it up to 90's game logic
[0:38:25] <JonnyJug> They were actually different visually on PS1
[0:38:30] <DehiDehi> Metals being the same color is a well know way to asses their structure
[0:38:31] <SilverRoddo> Beware of mimicry
[0:38:37] <@Nightbot> @zooeymainbtw -> What? Did you think I was gone forever? [stop spamming symbols] [warning]
[0:38:37] <Daxalog> Whats that supposed to be mean?
[0:38:39] <jellssssss20> how does he look at those watches on his neck?
[0:38:41] <%Void_The_Dark> what did he mean by that
[0:38:43] <+Garden_Hills> You have to lobotomize yourself to play
[0:38:45] <+MisterRockett> That used to be a bold of electricity they'd shoot at you.
[0:38:45] <Jdrockefeller> you found all the dragon dads
[0:38:51] <Coystick> Look at Spyro's idle animations tho
[0:38:54] <+MisterRockett> bolt*
[0:38:56] <Triblade1992> vidya gaem has to vidya gaem
[0:39:06] <+dowmein> thawed up?
[0:39:10] <C24U> Contingency Plan
[0:39:10] <KaiserMario> Dragons are everlasting, so to them time is immaterial
[0:39:14] <MissHedgey> They are conscious in the crystals.
[0:39:14] <$pennykettle_> Doesnt this game have dark souls rolls
[0:39:16] <SunsetJack> They were physically frozen but not mentally maybe lol
[0:39:18] <%Too_Much_Nukie> I think they're still able to think while frozen.
[0:39:24] <DehiDehi> That last dragon didn’t even than you for free ing him
[0:39:32] <Coystick> L1/R1 to Dark Souls
[0:39:33] <Doublemint_Dave_> Spyro's feet have such a gentle slap on the ground ~
[0:39:35] <%Too_Much_Nukie> The rolling dodge might only be in 2 and 3. I don't know.
[0:39:35] <cap_bon> Rescue a super out of touch dragon thats like "how about that fornite right"
[0:39:41] <Coystick> Yeees?
[0:39:44] <JonnyJug> No
[0:39:46] <MissHedgey> They removed the roll because of how pointless it was after this game.
[0:39:49] <$pennykettle_> I dont think ive ever used that practically
[0:39:50] <+sleepy_rinea> you never have to use the roll
[0:39:51] <+Double_Tap_That> So this game is the Dark Souls of mascot platformers?
[0:39:55] <Coystick> You use them maybe twice in the whole 3 games
[0:39:56] <Cyral_Drive> any roll is a dark souls roll
[0:39:56] <+MisterRockett> I've literally never seen that.
[0:40:02] <Aydarkzero> roll is useful like a few times honestly
[0:40:04] <+Scevda> I FRAMES WOO
[0:40:08] <SilverRoddo> Imma guess, it has Folklore rolls.
[0:40:10] <C24U> Can you use the roll to like cancel out of like the charge?
[0:40:11] <%Too_Much_Nukie> The rolls are used in very specific boss fights and that's it.
[0:40:17] <@CrankyVT> locked chests only have gems yeah
[0:40:19] <%kyh9> How can this be 'that furry game' if BigDad hasn't done art of it yet?
[0:40:19] <%Too_Much_Nukie> It's just gems.
[0:40:25] <@CrankyVT> Only matters if you're going for a 100% completion
[0:40:27] <ThisGamingDragon> nobody tell him
[0:40:27] <%kyh9> Hell, YOU haven't done Spyro art yet?
[0:40:28] <Coystick> Fairy hip juice
[0:40:28] <Aydarkzero> @PlagueOfGripes checkpoint
[0:40:30] <+TheEvaFreak> save juice
[0:40:34] <%Too_Much_Nukie> Saving your progress
[0:40:35] <%kyh9> Or have you and I missed it?
[0:40:37] <LunarRemix> Anti-piracy sparkles.
[0:40:38] <Firemane1279> @kyh9 Give it time. Kappa
[0:40:44] <MissHedgey> Lady spray is made up of many things.
[0:40:48] <+jt427> if you click the right stick the dragonfly will point you in the direction of the nearest gem you havent got
[0:40:48] <Cyral_Drive> checkzap
[0:40:49] <LunarRemix> Man the third game had some weird DMR thing on the PS1
[0:40:51] <+Scevda> You are now her property
[0:40:51] <$pennykettle_> Those chests had locks on them too LUL
[0:40:52] <KaiserMario> @PlagueOfGripes Do you prefer this type of little to no plot game, or would you rather this was some Kingdom Hearts style plot?
[0:40:54] <%kyh9> kyh9 subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 5 months! How can it be 'that furry game
[0:40:56] <dadeaner> in the original, they zapped you with a lightning bolt
[0:41:03] <%kyh9> they're called Scalies
[0:41:05] <superhersheybomb> Dam I just realized spyro 1 and Dr. Stone start the same way
[0:41:09] <$studleydoorite> one fart fart fart, he fart fart
[0:41:09] <%Too_Much_Nukie> @jt427 I never knew that was a thing, that'd save so much time jesus.
[0:41:09] <Katakumo> "Fellow"
[0:41:10] <+trustycoyote> or fellow
[0:41:24] <Pouch_cotato> one smart fella, he felt smart
[0:41:27] <Triblade1992> the key goes into the well @PlagueOfGripes
[0:41:34] <+SirGO0SE> youre one fart smella :)
[0:41:35] <Coystick> Don't lose your way
[0:41:37] <laserbeaming> They were kinda figuring out stuff in Spyro 1, it does get better in 2 and 3
[0:41:38] <jellssssss20> down into theabyss
[0:41:39] <+jt427> @Too_Much_Nukie i didnt know it for like 15 years lmao
[0:41:40] <KaiserMario> Like Dark Souls
[0:41:45] <SunsetJack> The well?
[0:41:46] <Shadope342> new londo well
[0:41:48] <cap_bon> has this game already turned your brain to mush
[0:41:50] <%Too_Much_Nukie> Try doing a dash jump, feels good.
[0:41:52] <ahaegotrigger> LUL
[0:41:53] <ThisGamingDragon> The well Timmy
[0:41:59] <Triblade1992> The well Timmy
[0:42:07] <$pennykettle_> If you jump down the well you get a shortcut to the Tomb of Giants
[0:42:08] <+treemanfour> Oh hey that furry game
[0:42:08] <Coystick> pitter patter pitter patter
[0:42:17] <Jdrockefeller> is it narrated by David Attenborough?
[0:42:22] <jellssssss20> The well you keep doing laps around lol
[0:42:29] <KaiserMario> Do dragons poop?
[0:42:32] <LunarRemix> Game looks so comfy. Like childhood comfiness
[0:42:42] <+NickHatesSnow> The music matching the walking is a really nice touch
[0:42:45] <$studleydoorite> yeah are these pitter patters different than the original?
[0:42:48] <%Too_Much_Nukie> @KaiserMario Second game confirms they do
[0:42:53] <TheLemuroid> I suppose Spyro was some people's awakening
[0:42:59] <Jdrockefeller> the music is nice and chill
[0:43:04] <+MisterRockett> Have you never glided in a platformer, Eli?
[0:43:04] <KaiserMario> Well damn
[0:43:07] <ThisGamingDragon> Spyro is the TRUTH

[0:43:24] <+Mirokiz> the second game has one furry bait
[0:43:26] <JonnyJug> Those are the sequels, yeah
[0:43:27] <+treemanfour> Nah, just in the 2nd and 3rd
[0:43:28] <$pennykettle_> 2 has some BABES
[0:43:29] <laserbeaming> The 2nd one has 2 Furry Bait Female Characters @PlagueOfGripes
[0:43:29] <JailShmixRemix> Spyro 2 has your back
[0:43:30] <+sleepy_rinea> a feature unique to the remake is that if you click the right analog stick, the dragonfly points to gems
[0:43:30] <%Too_Much_Nukie> 2's FIRST CUTSCENE has one.
[0:43:31] <DehiDehi> Uh oh
[0:43:33] <+OnwardEch0> REmember the skylanders design of spyro? awful
[0:43:37] <$pennykettle_> WOW!
[0:43:42] <+BubbaRands> You could...y'know...make one? Kappa
[0:43:42] <+MisterRockett> I still like pug Spyro.
[0:43:45] <$studleydoorite> to give the shocker to with your horns in a charge
[0:43:47] <Coystick> ...Aside from the fairies I don't remember there being a single woman in 1.
[0:43:49] <Aydarkzero> @OnwardEch0 no b/c it never happened Kappa
[0:43:49] <jellssssss20> are you missing 6? rip
[0:43:53] <Daxalog> This your hell now
[0:43:55] <JonnyJug> You got the shiny!
[0:43:56] <KaiserMario> There were some more on the upper part of the level
[0:43:57] <DehiDehi> SPYRO TRIFUSION LETS GOOOO
[0:43:57] <+zooeymainbtw> that's all you get buckeroo
[0:43:57] <SilverRoddo> You did it
[0:44:00] <Firemane1279> Spyro: Ripto's Rage has 1. Spyro: Year of the Dragon has another too.
[0:44:01] <Coystick> But there are a lot of faires
[0:44:06] <cap_bon> Nothing. Absolutely nothing.
[0:44:07] <%Void_The_Dark> Is Eli becoming Doog?
[0:44:14] <+dieterpet> Are you planning on doing a lore walkthrough for this game like you did with dark souls? Loved that one!
[0:44:17] <LunarRemix> He's happy.
[0:44:17] <@PeachSaliva> Eliiiiiiiiiii
[0:44:20] <+Scevda> Ya Eli wheres the talking head?
[0:44:22] <+OnwardEch0> @Aydarkzero aye you're right, what the heck was I talking about even
[0:44:22] <%Too_Much_Nukie> You can move around on load screens btw.
[0:44:22] <Coystick> Peeeeach

[0:44:25] <KellBeII> it paige
[0:44:27] <+Garden_Hills> korone playing spyro, i wonder...
[0:44:28] <tiaramaki> Hey, Paige
[0:44:31] <@PeachSaliva> Eli hey are you winning Eli
[0:44:31] <Triblade1992> I think so
[0:44:32] <%Too_Much_Nukie> Yes.
[0:44:32] <$pennykettle_> absolutely
[0:44:33] <Futurecity10> yes
[0:44:36] <jellssssss20> yeah
[0:44:37] <+UberWolfman> How hard did Paige put you up to this?
[0:44:39] <ahaegotrigger> not 100% but yeah
[0:44:41] <+jacewolf_is_the_best> oh no its her
[0:44:42] <+BubbaRands> Mustard Queen Appeareth!
[0:44:42] <SirFancySwank> press the analogs in to have the dragonfly point to nearest gems
[0:44:42] <Coystick> He's freeing bitches
[0:44:44] <artificerjoni> Hi Paige
[0:44:45] <%Too_Much_Nukie> The first game is quite short if you don't go for 100%.
[0:44:46] <heybenice> Ya
[0:44:50] <weissguard> A wild Peach has appeared!
[0:44:51] <+trustycoyote> Mustard Queen Cometh
[0:44:51] <+zooeymainbtw> I would love to watch doog playing spyro
[0:44:52] <C24U> It was a PS1 3D game so I imagine so
[0:44:52] <@PeachSaliva> I received attention!
[0:44:56] <%Too_Much_Nukie> You can already go to the second world if you want Plague.
[0:44:58] <Aydarkzero> there was something so funny when hearing that in the original
[0:44:59] <@CrankyVT> hi paige
[0:44:59] <ThisGamingDragon> I remember in the originals when the loading screens were ACTUALLY SEAMLESS :(
[0:45:03] <Shadope342> he's loving every minute of it
[0:45:07] <Djinnazz> Accidently? You CAN just beat it in 3 hours.
[0:45:07] <+zooeymainbtw> 90's funny
[0:45:10] <MissHedgey> It's trying to be cute.
[0:45:10] <@PeachSaliva> Hi cranky ❤️
[0:45:11] <Coystick> IT'S A CHILDREN'S CARD GAME
[0:45:11] <$pennykettle_> does he know about the skateboard?
[0:45:13] <laserbeaming> I doubt it's trying to be funny
[0:45:16] <Jdrockefeller> it's kid cute
[0:45:17] <KellBeII> its so not funny that its funny
[0:45:17] <Triblade1992> It DEFINTELLY a series built upon nostalgia and nostalgia alone
[0:45:17] <+UberWolfman> That's the 90s
[0:45:18] <JonnyJug> It's smirk humor
[0:45:18] <KaiserMario> Are dragon dicks retractable?
[0:45:21] <jellssssss20> Murder that scared Pat
[0:45:22] <MissHedgey> And also edgy, for the first game.
[0:45:23] <+jiggy_snipe> so unfunny it became funny
[0:45:32] <ThisGamingDragon> Spyro's "Oh, right." was better in the original.
[0:45:33] <C24U> Did they have these jokes in the original?
[0:45:34] <Huntercd> Robbery
[0:45:36] <DehiDehi> @kaisermario of course not they just flop around
[0:45:36] <Jdrockefeller> it wasn't like made to be that kind of Pixar funny for adults and kids
[0:45:43] <Aydarkzero> i think it's mostly the direction the remasters had
[0:45:44] <jellssssss20> I mean, round goblin*
[0:45:44] <+zooeymainbtw> not from there
[0:45:50] <+MisterRockett> Remember all of these lines are authentic to what they said in the PSX original. They just gave the dragons unique redesigns and animations.
[0:45:57] <Doublemint_Dave_> don't say uppies plague
[0:45:59] <JonnyJug> @C24U Pretty much word to word
[0:46:06] <artificerjoni> Hi Cranky cranky5Pat
[0:46:15] <jellssssss20> "collect 'em all" is why
[0:46:16] <Coystick> Sienfeld the Dragon
[0:46:17] <Triblade1992> Because pretty gems go brbrbrbrbr
[0:46:18] <KaiserMario> Yeah, like Banjo
[0:46:19] <tolloponik> yeah 2 Bucks!
[0:46:20] <+jt427> correct
[0:46:22] <MissHedgey> Collection, in its purest form.
[0:46:24] <+RadicalPirate> The Seinfeld of platformers
[0:46:27] <%Too_Much_Nukie> Town Square has a reward for burning all the sheep.
[0:46:28] <+RadicalPirate> if you will
[0:46:29] <@PeachSaliva> It’s about furries man
[0:46:32] <LunarRemix> It's relaxing
[0:46:33] <Triblade1992> It was aimed at little kids
[0:46:34] <+Scevda> @misterrockett id think 100% authentic, but ya they were tutorial speakers.
[0:46:35] <+MisterRockett> Kids.
[0:46:36] <ThisGamingDragon> It sold REALLY WELL
[0:46:36] <KellBeII> games didnt need to be as complex back then
[0:46:36] <cap_bon> The answer is always going to be because video game
[0:46:37] <ahaegotrigger> it became a whole thing
[0:46:38] <+trustycoyote> Well I mean that's collectathons in a nutshell
[0:46:39] <+OnwardEch0> isnt this more liek scalies?
[0:46:40] <@PeachSaliva> Scalies, if you will
[0:46:41] <dadeaner> the seinfeld of videogames
[0:46:41] <C24U> Think about what else was around during the PS1 era in terms of PS 3D platformers
[0:46:42] <ahaegotrigger> got like 8 games
[0:46:42] <kingra> YET
[0:46:42] <Shadope342> have u not seen the hot dragon dads
[0:46:43] <Coystick> It was the PS1 Jesus Christmas Christ
[0:46:46] <ahaegotrigger> Theyre Scalies
[0:46:46] <%Too_Much_Nukie> The sequels are about furries Plague.
[0:46:48] <SirFancySwank> it was real good for the time
[0:46:48] <laserbeaming> The furries are in the 2nd one
[0:46:49] <Samex_Comex> You can glide and shoot fire it's cool
[0:46:49] <MissHedgey> Not yet, it's not about furries.
[0:46:49] <$pennykettle_> I think this game was special in its large levels and line of sight tech
[0:46:49] <+NickHatesSnow> hey paige
[0:46:51] <Jdrockefeller> they needed their kids games on the ps1
[0:46:51] <+BubbaRands> babby design for babby children
[0:46:53] <+MisterRockett> Yeah
[0:46:54] <jellssssss20> It's about SCALIES Paige, come on
[0:46:55] <+Scevda> Yet
[0:46:57] <+OnwardEch0> Because it was
[0:46:57] <ahaegotrigger> Exactly
[0:46:58] <Coystick> Yes, it was
[0:46:58] <%Too_Much_Nukie> Yeah the first game is baby's first platformer.
[0:46:59] <+OnwardEch0> LOL
[0:47:01] <Cyral_Drive> I don't think the original game felt as childish as the remake
[0:47:01] <laserbeaming> It was
[0:47:01] <BlkFlameKami> plague broke the code
[0:47:03] <Jinrya_Geki> what point dies a game have to get for you to stop playing it?
[0:47:03] <+TheHylianWolfo> it was made for small children
[0:47:04] <Huntercd> Bianca is not in this game right?
[0:47:05] <cap_bon> It was
[0:47:05] <+MisterRockett> I got this game when I was like, 5
[0:47:06] <+jiggy_snipe> probably
[0:47:06] <Aydarkzero> i was roughly that age when i played them but i enjoyed 2 & 3 more
[0:47:07] <@CrankyVT> it was a simpler time
[0:47:07] <+TheHylianWolfo> i know because I was one
[0:47:07] <Jdrockefeller> N64 was ripe with the collectathons
[0:47:09] <Doublemint_Dave_> It was made for you plague
[0:47:09] <Futurecity10> considering that was the age I play these games
[0:47:09] <Daxalog> Didnt you know those kids who just really liked spyro?
[0:47:10] <london_flexing> 5-12? Like 5-7
[0:47:12] <ThisGamingDragon> Did Eli honestly forget what the 90s were like?
[0:47:16] <+dantejoestar21> oh shit, it the plaguemen
[0:47:18] <Jdrockefeller> they needed a competitior
[0:47:19] <dadeaner> it was
[0:47:19] <JonnyJug> Kill'em all!
[0:47:20] <Exadata_> yay I play dwagon
[0:47:20] <%Too_Much_Nukie> I 100%d this game when I was 5 years old so yeah.
[0:47:23] <+dowmein> fuck'em
[0:47:24] <+OnwardEch0> OH man that Kangaroo was so cute <3 Sheila.
[0:47:25] <C24U> This was also during the PS mascot wars wasn't it?
[0:47:30] <@PeachSaliva> FUCK EM
[0:47:35] <leinadtonu> Are chickens really innocent?
[0:47:35] <+Mirokiz> dude, its a 90`s childrens game
[0:47:37] <+cursedwithadhd> Spyro A Heros Tail had a story i think
[0:47:40] <jellssssss20> Wow he's absolutely alive and suffering in that statue, lol
[0:47:41] <Doublemint_Dave_> WHAT DAT NECK DO
[0:47:41] <kingra> SO MANY designs
[0:47:43] <ahaegotrigger> LUL
[0:47:44] <%Too_Much_Nukie> I don't like his seam.
[0:47:45] <AlanJoestar> so many artist dragons
[0:47:45] <Shadope342> he needs his dragons THICKER
[0:47:47] <KaiserMario> He's a sculptor!
[0:47:48] <Samex_Comex> Long
[0:47:51] <Coystick> Use the Right Stick Eli
[0:47:52] <+luftraumm1> @peachsaliva call plague peach!
[0:47:53] <$pennykettle_> that dragon calls women 'females'
[0:47:55] <LunarRemix> All of them.
[0:47:56] <%Too_Much_Nukie> They did it for the toys.
[0:47:58] <BlkFlameKami> they didn't in the original
[0:47:59] <Aydarkzero> right so many models Kappa
[0:48:00] <C24U> Wait, he was turned into a statue with a statue he was carving?
[0:48:01] <laserbeaming> They did a bunch of them!
[0:48:02] <+Scevda> They used to be palette swaps Eli.
[0:48:03] <Triblade1992> Toys plague. Toys
[0:48:05] <+BubbaRands> He just dropped out of art school Kappa
[0:48:06] <Coystick> @PeachSaliva Invade Plague
[0:48:06] <+jt427> tbh thats one of the most impresssive parts of this game
[0:48:06] <+MisterRockett> Not in the original. Loooot of repeats.
[0:48:07] <JonnyJug> The new dragon designs were pretty impressive
[0:48:07] <%Too_Much_Nukie> They sold toys of most of these dragons.
[0:48:07] <MissHedgey> The remake team spent SO much effort on the daddy dragons.
[0:48:07] <Daxalog> In the original they wer ejust recolours
[0:48:08] <Srthunda> not even
[0:48:08] <+treemanfour> purely a remake feature
[0:48:09] <%Too_Much_Nukie> Nope.
[0:48:09] <$pennykettle_> no
[0:48:09] <SirFancySwank> not in the original
[0:48:10] <@CrankyVT> I dont think so
[0:48:10] <kingra> No
[0:48:10] <SilverRoddo> Because he’s French?
[0:48:10] <JonnyJug> Nope
[0:48:10] <Zebroneath> no
[0:48:11] <+mezz44> back in the ps1 version I think it was generic
[0:48:12] <JonnyJug> Only this
[0:48:12] <ahaegotrigger> No
[0:48:12] <+TheEvaFreak> no
[0:48:12] <$pennykettle_> absolutely not
[0:48:13] <Triblade1992> No
[0:48:13] <laserbeaming> They don't reuse them
[0:48:13] <+treemanfour> nope, unique
[0:48:14] <@CrankyVT> in 1 its all bespoke models
[0:48:14] <jellssssss20> No money for writers only money for dragon models
[0:48:14] <Aydarkzero> Yes but also no Kappa
[0:48:17] <SirFancySwank> no the dragons dont return
[0:48:18] <%Too_Much_Nukie> EVERY DRAGON IS UNIQUE
[0:48:18] <Coystick> Nope, these are one-offs
[0:48:18] <Triblade1992> all unique
[0:48:19] <+Scevda> In the PS1.
[0:48:19] <Cyral_Drive> No they only show up when you get the statues
[0:48:20] <%Too_Much_Nukie> It's insane.
[0:48:20] <@CrankyVT> in 3 they reuse stuff, but here it's all unique
[0:48:25] <$pennykettle_> these never appear again. these aren't characters, theyre cardboard cutouts
[0:48:28] <KaiserMario> It's for Skylanders
[0:48:28] <%Void_The_Dark> @PlagueOfGripes original game didn't have all these models
[0:48:28] <+skylerpilot> they didn't have unique models in the original
[0:48:31] <ahaegotrigger> try charging
[0:48:33] <+jkunblade> no
[0:48:35] <MissHedgey> They reused designs for 2 and 3, but the first game's remake carefully crafted all the hunky daddies.
[0:48:36] <Zebroneath> You only see them the once
[0:48:37] <Coystick> Hahahahaa
[0:48:39] <+TheEvaFreak> there are 80 dragons in spyro 1
[0:48:41] <+MisterRockett> In the PSX games they had maybe 3-4 generic gragons they reused. The unique ones are special to the remaster.
[0:48:43] <JonnyJug> They weren't original unique
[0:48:45] <+jiggy_snipe> cuz Spyro bro
[0:48:52] <%gupa5240> the dragons were all just one model in the original
[0:48:55] <$pennykettle_> I follow the concept artists that designed all of these dudes
[0:48:56] <MissHedgey> They were SO proud of their dragon redesigns.
[0:48:56] <ThisGamingDragon> Headbutt the bulls
[0:48:57] <+BubbaRands> psaBig M O N E Y ?
[0:48:57] <Daxalog> Cause spyro is flagship. I guess.
[0:48:57] <%Too_Much_Nukie> In the original game a lot of them were just color swaps.
[0:48:58] <LunarRemix> The designers probably had fun making them
[0:48:59] <tiaramaki> The remake made unique models, the original was palette swaps
[0:48:59] <Triblade1992> Welcome to Spyro Plague
[0:49:03] <+sleepy_rinea> there were like 2-3 models per world in the original
[0:49:04] <TheyCallMeVawn> OG Spyro didnt give any of the dragons personality or anything
[0:49:04] <Coystick> The dragon babies in 3 are repeated it's disappointing by comparison.
[0:49:04] <MissHedgey> It was in all the interviews.
[0:49:04] <%Too_Much_Nukie> With maybe a hat added or something.
[0:49:05] <+byrtrael> later games have more generic collectables
[0:49:06] <%Void_The_Dark> @PlagueOfGripes they are all unique for this game. Not the original
[0:49:08] <OperatorJo_> oh god a plague is streaming
[0:49:10] <+treemanfour> Made by furries, for furries
[0:49:12] <@CrankyVT> Because the Spyro franchise is that one popular series that's been in a nonstop beatdown i guess
[0:49:14] <Pouch_cotato> whats important is if you're having fun
[0:49:18] <%criticalinked> criticalinked subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 21 months, currently on a 14 month streak! glad to see my Twitch notifications are working (hint: they aren't) How's it goin' Plague?
[0:49:18] <MissHedgey> All the scalies were so happy to work on this remake.
[0:49:21] <%Too_Much_Nukie> RIP
[0:49:22] <Triblade1992> F
[0:49:23] <ThisGamingDragon> @misshedgey boy were they proud.
[0:49:24] <ahaegotrigger> LUL
[0:49:24] <+jiggy_snipe> LUL
[0:49:25] <Doublemint_Dave_> DEAD
[0:49:25] <OperatorJo_> F
[0:49:28] <%Too_Much_Nukie> He drowned.
[0:49:29] <+TheEvaFreak> yes
[0:49:29] <ahaegotrigger> Yup
[0:49:29] <Coystick> RESET
[0:49:29] <JailShmixRemix> Dragons cant swim
[0:49:32] <OperatorJo_> quiettNoice
[0:49:33] <+RadicalPirate> dragons can't swim
[0:49:33] <jellssssss20> And flew to Hell
[0:49:37] <+OnwardEch0> im sure several of the programmers/artists were fans when they were younger
[0:49:37] <%Too_Much_Nukie> Spyro learning how to swim is a thing in 2.
[0:49:38] <Triblade1992> yes
[0:49:39] <+BubbaRands> nah he's okay
[0:49:40] <laserbeaming> yes
[0:49:41] <$pennykettle_> who was phone
[0:49:43] <+RadicalPirate> yee
[0:49:50] <ThisGamingDragon> he can't swim until the next game
[0:49:54] <%Too_Much_Nukie> You have to pay a bear like 500 gems to learn to swim.
[0:49:55] <mustachegolem> holy shit yhis is the first time I see him
[0:49:57] <leinadtonu> he's made of sugar.
[0:49:57] <+SirGO0SE> BOP go to murder jail
[0:50:03] <mustachegolem> what a stud
[0:50:04] <+MisterRockett> Plague why are you so shocked about a water hazard in a platformer?????
[0:50:11] <$pennykettle_> If you want added fun, you can turn on the original OST in the menu
[0:50:13] <+cursedwithadhd> if you cant swim then yea you die
[0:50:20] <Shadope342> he's found the skill ceiling
[0:50:21] <Pouch_cotato> you can either charge or glide, not both
[0:50:29] <MissHedgey> Spyro's glide has deceptively far reach.
[0:50:33] <Doublemint_Dave_> ah yes, blue, the color of low health
[0:50:35] <$pennykettle_> LUL
[0:50:36] <laserbeaming> there goes the no damage run
[0:50:38] <ahaegotrigger> LUL
[0:50:38] <%Too_Much_Nukie> He's in pain.
[0:50:40] <+thegreenbenis> I'M BLUE
[0:50:41] <kingra> :O
[0:50:42] <%Void_The_Dark> he has gums
[0:50:44] <JonnyJug> Hahah
[0:50:47] <Coystick> KISS HIM
[0:50:49] <+thegreenbenis> Abada deee ababa da
[0:50:49] <+BubbaRands> MOUTH AGAPE
[0:50:50] <+treemanfour> Wretched creature
[0:50:51] <jellssssss20> wait, are those pips by the number of lives another health pool?
[0:50:52] <KaiserMario> Gaping Dragonfly
[0:50:52] <MissHedgey> It always looks like you can barely make it, but you can casually glide while standin still.
[0:50:53] <%Too_Much_Nukie> LUL
[0:50:55] <Triblade1992> IM BLUE DABA DEE DABA DAI
[0:50:56] <kingra> KonCha
[0:50:57] <$pennykettle_> please do art of Sparx the dragonfly
[0:50:58] <Doublemint_Dave_> fuckin gross
[0:50:58] <Aydarkzero> Sparx's redesign is so weird
[0:50:58] <MissHedgey> Sparx's redesign is horrifying.
[0:50:58] <Coystick> He's making the Ahegao face
[0:50:59] <+jt427> LUL
[0:51:00] <chambatron> Like Jynx
[0:51:04] <Shadope342> let him do his dreamworks face
[0:51:06] <Samex_Comex> But he's your friend
[0:51:11] <TheAsylumCat> fun fact, if you look at footage of the original games the voice acting is especially stupid its great
[0:51:11] <JonnyJug> They did my boy Sparx dirty
[0:51:16] <ahaegotrigger> im cryin LUL
[0:51:18] <SilverRoddo> Gummy smile?
[0:51:21] <Doublemint_Dave_> Unique dragon #53
[0:51:22] <kingra> CAKE???
[0:51:24] <%Too_Much_Nukie> Yes.
[0:51:27] <laserbeaming> yes
[0:51:28] <ahaegotrigger> Yes
[0:51:28] <%criticalinked> so talented
[0:51:28] <Samex_Comex> Cake!
[0:51:29] <+BubbaRands> Gimme a KITH THSPYRO
[0:51:29] <+jiggy_snipe> yep
[0:51:37] <ahaegotrigger> AND TOOK IT WITH HIM
[0:51:40] <AlanJoestar> that one actually looks decent imo
[0:51:41] <ahaegotrigger> WHAT AN ASSHOLE
[0:51:42] <jellssssss20> I'll bake this cake and eat it too
[0:51:44] <SirFancySwank> the cake was even for spyro
[0:51:59] <$pennykettle_> honestly hoping we get to the 2nd tonight by some chance
[0:51:59] <Jdrockefeller> he went to put it in the fridge for later
[0:52:05] <+NickHatesSnow> Didn't even offer you any what a dick
[0:52:07] <+RadicalPirate> DOCTOR EGGMAN
[0:52:13] <ThisGamingDragon> Sparx is scary when he's hurt and idk why they made him like that.
[0:52:13] <+masked_hero_lucky> You mock his advice, but I think in the original that dragon just said "thanks" and peaced out @PlagueOfGripes
[0:52:16] <ahaegotrigger> they steal eggs
[0:52:19] <ahaegotrigger> Yes
[0:52:19] <C24U> Hunt Hedgehogs?
[0:52:20] <+jiggy_snipe> they build robots
[0:52:22] <%Too_Much_Nukie> You need like 5 eggs to reach one of the worlds.
[0:52:22] <TheAsylumCat> note, all these Dragons are unique in this game, but they recycled them in the original
[0:52:22] <jellssssss20> They contain baby humans
[0:52:23] <socratetris> get eggs, get protein
[0:52:25] <$pennykettle_> its part of the l o r e you learn in later games
[0:52:26] <MissHedgey> This game has more collectibles than it needs.
[0:52:29] <SirFancySwank> coolectables for true ending
[0:52:31] <MissHedgey> Collecting for the sake of collecting.
[0:52:36] <+arancet> buuuut
[0:52:37] <MissHedgey> It is the purest collectathon.
[0:52:38] <+Scevda> Game finish %
[0:52:39] <tolloponik> they have a master plan!
[0:52:41] <MissHedgey> No plot. Just collect.
[0:52:49] <$pennykettle_> oh no
[0:52:50] <+cursedwithadhd> kill the egg stealing pedos
[0:52:55] <+MisterRockett> You collect Baby Dragons in the 2nd-3rd game who are all individually named. Not sure if their designs are as unique as the dragons tho people weren't as horny for them.
[0:52:55] <Triblade1992> Like the Asylum Demon fights?
[0:53:05] <laserbeaming> THE DARK SOULS OF MASCOT PLATFORMERS - Plague, misquoted
[0:53:11] <kingra> This is the DARK SOULS of mascot games
[0:53:15] <+jiggy_snipe> sounds like footsies Kappa
[0:53:17] <KaiserMario> Plague, the Dark Souls Master
[0:53:20] <+RadicalPirate> The Seinfeld of Dark Souls
[0:53:21] <Doublemint_Dave_> daaaaaaaaaaaark sooooooooooouls
[0:53:22] <ahaegotrigger> this game does train you to do that
[0:53:23] <KellBeII> it is footies
[0:53:24] <ThisGamingDragon> This game is speedrun value
[0:53:25] <Shadope342> I hope
[0:53:27] <%Too_Much_Nukie> Several nipples.
[0:53:28] <+BubbaRands> 6 IN FACT
[0:53:30] <%criticalinked> saucy

[0:53:50] <SilverRoddo> Horn nips
[0:53:51] <@PeachSaliva> RIP
[0:53:53] <%Too_Much_Nukie> I hate this jump.
[0:53:53] <Tebrial> Ive got to say, that just seeing your reactions to everything is probably more entertaining than the gameplay itself.
[0:53:53] <+UberWolfman> Dino Jesus
[0:53:56] <+Scevda> Theyre cancerous moles. He doesnt like to talk about them.
[0:53:56] <TheAsylumCat> oh, oh noe
[0:53:57] <jellssssss20> Do they turn into anime waifu fairies?
[0:53:58] <+BubbaRands> Are there Dragons in heaven Plague?
[0:53:59] <OperatorJo_> awa uwu too many nipples my dude
[0:54:03] <%Too_Much_Nukie> This jump is such bullshit.
[0:54:10] <Fien111> the 90s were strange
[0:54:11] <CalderGaming> but paige think of all the MILK
[0:54:17] <%Too_Much_Nukie> Glide from that platform.
[0:54:18] <ahaegotrigger> gliding
[0:54:20] <TheAsylumCat> @fien111 coke
[0:54:21] <%treemanfour> The dragonfly is your soul gem
[0:54:21] <MissHedgey> In later games, you get lives for every tenth fodder killed.
[0:54:24] <+Promessa_EX> i love these
[0:54:24] <%Too_Much_Nukie> That's the intended path and it sucks.
[0:54:25] <laserbeaming> that's what you're supposed to do
[0:54:25] <Triblade1992> maybe
[0:54:26] <C24U> symbiotic relationship
[0:54:26] <MissHedgey> Encourage chicken slaughter.
[0:54:27] <$pennykettle_> press triangle mid glide
[0:54:27] <jellssssss20> yes
[0:54:27] <ahaegotrigger> yes
[0:54:27] <+Promessa_EX> tbh
[0:54:28] <JonnyJug> If you believe
[0:54:28] <Shadope342> you can
[0:54:28] <+masked_hero_lucky> No cheating here, that's the intended method
[0:54:28] <Tebrial> That is how you do it
[0:54:29] <Samex_Comex> Yes
[0:54:30] <Srthunda> thats the intended way
[0:54:31] <+thegreenbenis> Yes
[0:54:32] <+TheEvaFreak> that the intended route
[0:54:32] <KaiserMario> If you could eat dragon meat, which part would you eat? The thigh? The breast? The tail?
[0:54:33] <+jorgamund> you can if you believe in yourself
[0:54:34] <leinadtonu> ye
[0:54:34] <Cyral_Drive> Yes :)
[0:54:35] <Tebrial> its a tight jump
[0:54:35] <Fien111> Imma say no to spite you
[0:54:39] <+Scevda> The dragonfly is your phylactery.
[0:54:46] <jellssssss20> try that triangle when you're not high enough at the end of the jump
[0:54:48] <$pennykettle_> PogChamp
[0:54:49] <ahaegotrigger> yeah thats the right way
[0:54:49] <MissHedgey> This game is DEVIOUS with its secrets.
[0:54:49] <+NickHatesSnow> ye
[0:54:51] <ahaegotrigger> Pog
[0:54:53] <%Too_Much_Nukie> Yeah because it's a bullshit jump.
[0:54:53] <MissHedgey> Especially in later levels.
[0:54:54] <Shadope342> LUL

[0:55:47] <+BubbaRands> "Long Live the King"
[0:55:53] <+masked_hero_lucky> There's another camera mode you can switch to
[0:55:55] <$pennykettle_> theres 2 camera modes in the settings
[0:55:56] <+Scevda> @bettysharkface the model used to be same for all with some color pallete swaps i believe.
[0:55:59] <%Too_Much_Nukie> Yeah this game is too faithful to the original in some ways.
[0:56:03] <CursedNobleman> town square! love this music
[0:56:06] <jellssssss20> Not a complaint, but a Gripe?
[0:56:07] <aubrea> there are 2 camera modes, maybe turn it to active?
[0:56:10] <C24U> Was this before or after the Dual Shock released?
[0:56:10] <CursedNobleman> hell, love this soundtrack
[0:56:14] <%Too_Much_Nukie> Yeah you can glide there.
[0:56:14] <KaiserMario> Ps1 games didn't use the right stick often, and never for the camera
[0:56:20] <Jdrockefeller> I love that thud noise
[0:56:21] <CursedNobleman> i think this was dualshock
[0:56:24] <+NickHatesSnow> Yeah I cant stand when platformers do that

[0:57:17] <+TheEvaFreak> collecting
[0:57:18] <+jkunblade> are they like pokeballs?
[0:57:19] <MissHedgey> The egg is just a collectible.
[0:57:20] <laserbeaming> I think the eggs do nothing
[0:57:20] <ahaegotrigger> Eggs for babby Dragon
[0:57:21] <%treemanfour> Town square
[0:57:21] <$pennykettle_> town square
[0:57:22] <%bettysharkface> Oh god I just noticed the dude in the spyro onesie on the side there, damn it.
[0:57:23] <CursedNobleman> eggs are a gating option for one world
[0:57:24] <MissHedgey> This game is pure collectathon.
[0:57:24] <%Too_Much_Nukie> You're in Town Square.
[0:57:25] <%treemanfour> And egg is for egg
[0:57:28] <+UberWolfman> Progression blocker

[0:57:33] <KaiserMario> @crankyvt Even after the dualshock was released, PS1 games didn't know what to do with right stick
[0:57:37] <+masked_hero_lucky> Artisans is the hub, everything under that is levels
[0:57:44] <ahaegotrigger> youre in town square the arrow shows you
[0:57:44] <CursedNobleman> this area is called twon square
[0:57:44] <$pennykettle_> the one with the big ass arrow? yea

[0:58:03] <%Too_Much_Nukie> Skill points are for unlocking concept art.
[0:58:06] <@CrankyVT> Thaaaat's super true too Kaiser yeah
[0:58:08] <%Too_Much_Nukie> Very misleading name.
[0:58:08] <Jdrockefeller> artisans = peach castle, everything else is like the diff worlds
[0:58:08] <jellssssss20> Ohh

[0:59:12] <C24U> He was a dog cleaning himself
[0:59:30] <%Too_Much_Nukie> I don't remember if there's a bonus cutscene for 100% completion in this one.
[0:59:31] <+TheEvaFreak> there are more levels than listed there
[0:59:31] <CursedNobleman> dark hollow
[0:59:32] <+thegreenbenis> The second one is the good one plague.

[1:00:15] <CriticKitten> ....what
[1:00:15] <kingra> I've seen bits of it
[1:00:16] <+thegreenbenis> OBLITERATE!
[1:00:16] <+jkunblade> Spyro 2 is kinda lame.
[1:00:17] <+Konquerer> look man
[1:00:18] <+UberWolfman> I watched it 100 times
[1:00:18] <Triblade1992> I have actually never seen it
[1:00:19] <DuoMaxwell64> I like Sex Bunny more though
[1:00:20] <+Garden_Hills> i havent but please send me link!
[1:00:21] <+jkunblade> 3 is better tbh
[1:00:22] <+Scevda> Lol

[1:00:25] <CursedNobleman> oh, elora. shes popular on furry sites?
[1:00:27] <jellssssss20> to google!

[1:00:30] <+Noelle_of_the_Nova> I honestly have no idea what you are talking about Plague
[1:00:33] <reiface08> what's he talking about? what am i supposed to google?
[1:00:34] <Firemane1279> Totally elaborate animation we don't know about. Kappa
[1:00:36] <+TheHylianWolfo> 2 > 3 > 1 for the original trilogy
[1:00:38] <laserbeaming> Plague, like Zone, is watching you
[1:00:42] <$pennykettle_> theres a kangaroo in 3
[1:00:47] <ahaegotrigger> what was what?
[1:00:47] <+thegreenbenis> Left arm of the forbidden one
[1:00:48] <Shadope342> thats the soul of the critter
[1:00:50] <SilverRoddo> I probably seen it, i’ll just have to be refreshed.
[1:00:54] <+TheEvaFreak> enemies you've already killed drop peearls, get enough you get a life
[1:00:56] <+lethallylactic> Those are if you've already got gems
[1:00:56] <KaiserMario> The fire
[1:00:58] <biomegabear> extra live stuff
[1:00:59] <Zebroneath> pips to new life
[1:01:00] <SleepyMaribo> yes
[1:01:00] <%Too_Much_Nukie> Orbs are for defeating enemies you've already killed.
[1:01:00] <ahaegotrigger> oh those eventually become a life
[1:01:01] <tiaramaki> Yes
[1:01:01] <%Too_Much_Nukie> Yes.
[1:01:01] <+sleepy_rinea> yes
[1:01:01] <+masked_hero_lucky> Yes
[1:01:01] <@CrankyVT> Yup
[1:01:02] <+thegreenbenis> Yes
[1:01:02] <ahaegotrigger> YES
[1:01:03] <Katakumo> yup
[1:01:04] <KaiserMario> Ye
[1:01:06] <ahaegotrigger> that exactly
[1:01:08] <CursedNobleman> enemies drop a gem, then they drop that treasurethingie
[1:01:11] <$pennykettle_> When you eat at full health, yea
[1:01:16] <C24U> Like collecting 100 rings in Sonic?
[1:01:22] <%Too_Much_Nukie> You can ram them when they have their shield up to kill them.
[1:01:25] <+masked_hero_lucky> You can ram the shield guys
[1:01:29] <Jdrockefeller> flop
[1:01:30] <CursedNobleman> the underground area?
[1:01:49] <ahaegotrigger> good find though
[1:01:53] <+masked_hero_lucky> Bonfire lit
[1:01:55] <ahaegotrigger> youll find out
[1:01:56] <CursedNobleman> theres a minimap
[1:01:57] <%Too_Much_Nukie> If you light all bonfires it gives a skill point.
[1:01:58] <KaiserMario> YOu open the path to Majula
[1:01:59] <C24U> Rekindle the fire Spyro
[1:02:00] <+Scevda> Man, Frogs used to be such a popular enemy in this era of games...
[1:02:06] <$pennykettle_> its impressive in the original okay LUL
[1:02:08] <jellssssss20> respawns the enemies and refills estus, you know this
[1:02:13] <Jdrockefeller> bonfire lit
[1:02:20] <CursedNobleman> its pretty
[1:02:23] <Doublemint_Dave_> Why collect one ups, can you even die in this game
[1:02:25] <ahaegotrigger> it just glows
[1:02:27] <$pennykettle_> this is dukes archives
[1:02:27] <laserbeaming> It's nothing, it's just pretty
[1:02:28] <@CrankyVT> pretty floor
[1:02:29] <LunarRemix> It it pretty.
[1:02:31] <ahaegotrigger> its reading light
[1:02:32] <CursedNobleman> @Doublemint_Dave_ it gets harder.
[1:02:33] <LunarRemix> It is*
[1:02:34] <Triblade1992> It had chests originally
[1:02:36] <laserbeaming> Dragon are not smart
[1:02:36] <+masked_hero_lucky> Shhh, it's magic
[1:02:47] <%Rezca> They're dragons, libraries should all be on fire
[1:02:47] <%Too_Much_Nukie> This game gets harder but never all that hard.
[1:02:48] <jellssssss20> Duke's Dear Smashy Guy
[1:02:56] <$studleydoorite> is Plague hard enough to collect every gem?
[1:02:59] <$pennykettle_> waiting on sly cooper remake
[1:03:04] <Coystick> Backstab tech
[1:03:04] <tolloponik> why is the reading light under you
[1:03:18] <%gupa5240> its implied that the worlds are locked into a single weather condition
[1:03:21] <+EyeFarted> burnt ogre cheeks...
[1:03:25] <Jdrockefeller> so big yet so tender
[1:03:25] <CursedNobleman> hmm, there are 2 higher spots in the garden
[1:03:28] <ahaegotrigger> it was up
[1:03:30] <biomegabear> the irony of dragons learning magic when they themselves are invincible to magic in terms western fantasy lore
[1:03:31] <ahaegotrigger> at the start
[1:03:40] <+Scevda> Man the Undead Crypt really has some strange visuals in full lighting.
[1:03:41] <+dowmein> maybe its at the subway
[1:03:43] <laserbeaming> You need to get the Strangely Attractive Dragons, YOU MUST
[1:03:45] <SilverRoddo> These orcs have low aggro, which is nice.
[1:03:47] <Shwepie> Check deviantart for the video game dragons.
[1:03:56] <ScreamLord> @PlagueOfGripes Did you ever play the OG Spyro Trilogy on PS1?
[1:03:59] <%Too_Much_Nukie> Look out for those frogs.
[1:04:05] <$pennykettle_> Have you all seen the art of Spyro working at Subway though
[1:04:07] <Doublemint_Dave_> That's such a shitty reward
[1:04:14] <Coystick> IT SHOWS
[1:04:14] <CursedNobleman> why are you playing this? LUL
[1:04:17] <Triblade1992> @pennykettle_ WHY
[1:04:20] <+thegreenbenis> Subway is my favorite spyro minigame
[1:04:26] <ahaegotrigger> he knows nothing but Elora the horny goat girl
[1:04:31] <Jdrockefeller> wait is his club just giant meat
[1:04:32] <jellssssss20> Which is what? Almost nothing?
[1:04:33] <Coystick> @thegreenbenis cease
[1:04:36] <ahaegotrigger> Kreygasm
[1:04:43] <+Garden_Hills> Theres a enable map option
[1:04:44] <+jiggy_snipe> WutFace
[1:04:45] <Jdrockefeller> CBT
[1:04:47] <Doublemint_Dave_> Thicc
[1:04:59] <Coystick> Elora "I want your purple knot, Spyro" the Faun
[1:05:00] <ahaegotrigger> a "hint"
[1:05:06] <ahaegotrigger> ^
[1:05:12] <+masked_hero_lucky> This goes for all metal enemies btw
[1:05:12] <+Promessa_EX> it's really a different game when you play it as a stupid kid
[1:05:15] <KaiserMario> Congrats Plague!
[1:05:18] <%Too_Much_Nukie> Yeah that's important later on.
[1:05:21] <KaiserMario> Good Job!
[1:05:26] <ahaegotrigger> all metal enemies that arent huge
[1:05:28] <%Too_Much_Nukie> When they won't give you a chance to burn the metal enemies.
[1:05:31] <$pennykettle_> I think you can exit level via menu when you are done
[1:05:33] <+thegreenbenis> Does hunter show up in this?
[1:05:34] <ahaegotrigger> no those big guys were weak to fire
[1:05:36] <CursedNobleman> you can leave via the menu
[1:05:43] <CursedNobleman> or theres the exit on the high part of the garden
[1:05:43] <%Too_Much_Nukie> You can leave via the pause menu.
[1:05:45] <+masked_hero_lucky> Actually no, if you find a giant metal enemy you'll have to find some other way to deal with them
[1:05:49] <+scurvydonger> you can open options and leave the area
[1:05:49] <GabeGrimm> how's the enemy variety in Spyro games?
[1:05:50] <ScreamLord> There is a Nexus mod that gives Elora gigantic, jiggling tits and makes her dress and goat pubes burnable
[1:05:54] <+thegreenbenis> You can leave with the pause menu
[1:05:56] <$studleydoorite> leaving via the pause menu is not canon
[1:05:56] <+masked_hero_lucky> Like how you had to flame them from behind
[1:06:00] <$pennykettle_> @ScreamLord wait really
[1:06:03] <tiaramaki> You can leave the world via the menu
[1:06:07] <+Garden_Hills> you can exit in the menu i think?
[1:06:10] <CursedNobleman> @ScreamLord you have a twisted mind
[1:06:16] <KaiserMario> You have a key
[1:06:16] <ScreamLord> @pennykettle_ Yup
[1:06:16] <Coystick> STOP
[1:06:17] <Jdrockefeller> lewd
[1:06:21] <Triblade1992> lewd

[1:06:36] <LunarRemix> Oh you'll see when you play the other games.
[1:06:38] <Coystick> She has modeled boyshorts, I checked
[1:06:39] <%Too_Much_Nukie> Underwear wasn't invented yet.
[1:06:40] <+EyeFarted> nice
[1:06:42] <LunarRemix> They knew what they were doing.
[1:06:46] <Triblade1992> She was going full blown Tinkerbell with that underskirt
[1:06:47] <+dowmein> so you got the burnable leaves mod, right?
[1:06:48] <laserbeaming> The people who made this game were SO HORNY.
[1:06:48] <ScreamLord> @CursedNobleman I didn't make, and I only know because it's on the popular tag in the mod page
[1:06:50] <afronooch> is this the one with the hot lady satyrs?
[1:06:56] <laserbeaming> I love them
[1:06:59] <%Too_Much_Nukie> You do not.

[1:07:14] <jellssssss20> Boss behind that one dragon you free'ed
[1:07:14] <%Too_Much_Nukie> You can leave right now if you want, or defeat the boss here first.
[1:07:16] <+thegreenbenis> There is a boss fight you can do. @PlagueOfGripes
[1:07:18] <laserbeaming> Those are Archievements
[1:07:18] <afronooch> ty Lunar, you a real one
[1:07:20] <+UberWolfman> Just art gallery
[1:07:20] <%Too_Much_Nukie> Skill points unlock concept art.
[1:07:20] <+TheEvaFreak> Ignore those
[1:07:24] <Triblade1992> achiievements
[1:07:25] <+masked_hero_lucky> Skill points are optional, and you only need to fill the requirements the balloonist sets for you
[1:07:27] <ahaegotrigger> those will give you a one up
[1:07:31] <%Too_Much_Nukie> They called them skill points because achievements weren't a thing yet.
[1:07:32] <+lethallylactic> Basically optional challenges or something.
[1:07:36] <+thegreenbenis> Just go to the boss.
[1:07:42] <Jdrockefeller> probably before they had a name for achievements specifically
[1:07:42] <aubrea> idk why those are called skill points, points you get for being skillful???
[1:07:43] <SirFancySwank> skill points are only concept art
[1:07:49] <%Too_Much_Nukie> There's a hidden flying level by the waterfall, and the boss behind the bull head.
[1:07:49] <+TheEvaFreak> plague there are more levels that you havent gone into yet
[1:07:51] <whittacre> they're "points for doing a skillful thing"
[1:07:52] <ahaegotrigger> you want me to help you find a secret plague?
[1:08:00] <$studleydoorite> you're not good enough to do those
[1:08:03] <+Promessa_EX> just extra fun chievos
[1:08:04] <jellssssss20> Oh they were called that in the Ratchet and Clank games too at the time
[1:08:04] <Triblade1992> I believe you can take on the boss
[1:08:09] <laserbeaming> you can leave the zone to the next world or do the boss
[1:08:11] <+EyeFarted> I just now noticed the Spiro onesie over Eli. Do you wear that around the house, @PlagueOfGripes
[1:08:14] <ScreamLord> @CursedNobleman It's literally on the first page when you go to the Spyro Nexus. Elora's Faunbags, lol
[1:08:15] <jellssssss20> Was that just a Playstation thing?
[1:08:17] <+Promessa_EX> not necessary for 100%
[1:08:19] <+thegreenbenis> Boss
[1:08:19] <+masked_hero_lucky> The remaster actually made that glide harder for some reason
[1:08:23] <AlanJoestar> there is a boss
[1:08:25] <Triblade1992> There was that boss you saw earlier
[1:08:30] <%Too_Much_Nukie> Go fight the boss through the bull head.
[1:08:31] <+thegreenbenis> You can super do the boss.
[1:08:32] <Shadope342> boss portal here
[1:08:32] <ahaegotrigger> you can fight the boss or fuck off to the other world
[1:08:34] <jellssssss20> Boss
[1:08:35] <+thegreenbenis> NOPE
[1:08:36] <Triblade1992> no
[1:08:37] <+lethallylactic> Nope
[1:08:38] <Zebroneath> no
[1:08:39] <biomegabear> I have the least amount of nostalgia for spyro 1 just because of the controls
[1:08:39] <laserbeaming> you don't
[1:08:43] <%Too_Much_Nukie> No you can already go to the next world if you want.
[1:08:45] <CursedNobleman> @ScreamLord unbelievable. its right there. modding was a mistake
[1:08:45] <nademonkey1100> mean why not anyway
[1:08:46] <ahaegotrigger> I dont think you need to beat any of the bosses actually just Gnorc

[1:09:33] <CursedNobleman> @ScreamLord all of these lewds are all one guy adding proportions to all the female characters!
[1:09:33] <%Too_Much_Nukie> The boss battles in this game sure are something.
[1:09:34] <+Garden_Hills> lets get toasty
[1:09:39] <$pennykettle_> Flamelurker ahead
[1:09:43] <Aussie_Manny> TOUCH NOTHING BUT THE TOAST

[1:10:01] <JonnyJug> Hahah
[1:10:03] <TheyCallMeVawn> Spyro 1 doesnt really have any characters

[1:10:12] <Aussie_Manny> Plague: "Yeah, but where's Elora tho?"
[1:10:13] <+lethallylactic> These dogs are beasts
[1:10:14] <%Too_Much_Nukie> There are no sheep or other health giving animals in boss areas.
[1:10:14] <ahaegotrigger> yep
[1:10:14] <CursedNobleman> @ScreamLord and faeries, and the shattered hills fauns
[1:10:15] <+TheNewZealandStory> use your dodge roll
[1:10:15] <+TIME_PUNCHER> fireproof dickwad
[1:10:17] <biomegabear> dog is rude
[1:10:17] <$pennykettle_> Sif
[1:10:18] <+masked_hero_lucky> These dogs are insane
[1:10:18] <aubrea> this is the hardest level in all 3 games
[1:10:19] <CalderGaming> IMMORTAL dog
[1:10:19] <ahaegotrigger> and the levels FULL of them
[1:10:24] <%Too_Much_Nukie> Just burn everything.
[1:10:27] <Jdrockefeller> powerful doggie
[1:10:30] <jellssssss20> Test out the roll for I-Frames!
[1:10:30] <+TIME_PUNCHER> the dog is toasty
[1:10:34] <+thegreenbenis> Goddamn
[1:10:37] <Aussie_Manny> omg this is the Dark Souls of Spyro
[1:10:37] <ahaegotrigger> now the darksouls level
[1:10:41] <+byrtrael> these dogs are the hardest enemies in the series, not even joking
[1:10:45] <ahaegotrigger> now THIS is Senns Fortress
[1:10:45] <SilverRoddo> You shall not pass
[1:10:51] <$studleydoorite> when dogs were first invented, the people who trained them were considered wizards
[1:10:53] <Katakumo> it takes 2. just like that song
[1:10:54] <CursedNobleman> my least favorite level is the damn village and the trick castle
[1:10:55] <KaiserMario> Dodge roll
[1:10:59] <$pennykettle_> Why do the dogs ground pound
[1:11:05] <%Too_Much_Nukie> Pretty much.
[1:11:11] <Aussie_Manny> Oh, just wait until the THREE HIT enemies! :O
[1:11:12] <+masked_hero_lucky> I think these are the only two hit enemies in the game
[1:11:14] <SilverRoddo> The game got real.
[1:11:16] <jellssssss20> Oh shit but waht about 3-hit enemies?
[1:11:17] <+TIME_PUNCHER> meine gott
[1:11:24] <biomegabear> I never used the roll
[1:11:24] <%Too_Much_Nukie> Try zooming in on these paintings.
[1:11:25] <AncelDeLambert> yeah I was really weirded out when I tried to play this game at how easily the enemies go down
[1:11:26] <Jdrockefeller> it takes 2 to set the dog alight
[1:11:29] <AlanJoestar> those Dogs are way buffer than Giant trolls in plater armor LUL
[1:11:30] <DillionPHCO> DillionPHCO subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 22 months! plagueGripes
[1:11:31] <$pennykettle_> This is the castle from ds2
[1:11:34] <%Too_Much_Nukie> They're concept art of the game.
[1:11:42] <jellssssss20> He tracks!
[1:11:54] <KaiserMario> Overhead tracks like Dark Souls 2
[1:11:54] <laserbeaming> I don't think it has i-frames
[1:11:58] <insaneintentionsyo> it's Commander Sheppard
[1:12:17] <$daveronald> cheer300
[1:12:19] <conchubar11> did you play the original spyro as a kid @PlagueOfGripes
[1:12:19] <jellssssss20> Do you dust those men?
[1:12:20] <ScreamLord> @CursedNobleman Luckily Crash Bandicoot was spared. Last time I checked there are no lewd mods for the N.Sane Trilogy. WHich is rather surprising
[1:12:25] <+jiggy_snipe> LUL
[1:12:28] <%Too_Much_Nukie> It's really not.
[1:12:29] <Jdrockefeller> wizard in the distance: "cahm aaaaahnn"
[1:12:30] <Shadope342> we all thought the same thing eli LUL
[1:12:32] <+lethallylactic> I saw it too Plague Kappa
[1:12:34] <+jiggy_snipe> i thought the same thing
[1:12:40] <SilverRoddo> Use charge, that’s not a command, merely a post hypnotic suggestion.
[1:12:41] <insaneintentionsyo> tiddy
[1:12:42] <+masked_hero_lucky> I can see it
[1:12:42] <AncelDeLambert> I see it too
[1:12:44] <+thackattack00> I see it
[1:12:45] <CursedNobleman> i can see it
[1:12:46] <ahaegotrigger> I see it
[1:12:47] <+thegreenbenis> I can see it
[1:12:50] <afronooch> i see it
[1:12:50] <CalderGaming> big flaming eyes?
[1:12:51] <nademonkey1100> im glad i am not the only one who thought that
[1:12:51] <Jdrockefeller> I saw it too
[1:12:52] <$pennykettle_> The first person mode is there because you couldnt tilt the camera up or down in the original
[1:13:01] <%Too_Much_Nukie> It is.
[1:13:04] <+Scevda> I can see it!
[1:13:11] <tolloponik> I see it
[1:13:13] <$studleydoorite> flexing women is all I can see when I close my eyes
[1:13:13] <%Too_Much_Nukie> It was concept art in the original too.
[1:13:16] <+byrtrael> it took me a while to even see the dragon head
[1:13:33] <Tebrial> I like the Dark Souls concept art in Anor Londo
[1:13:36] <Zebroneath> the bloodlust
[1:13:36] <%Too_Much_Nukie> I'LL FUCKING MURDER HIM
[1:13:38] <biomegabear> so edgy
[1:13:45] <+TheHylianWolfo> i love this boss
[1:13:46] <%Too_Much_Nukie> That is the boss.
[1:13:49] <Aydarkzero> in the remake at least
[1:13:51] <+thegreenbenis> They weren't scalies in the original.
[1:13:54] <+TheHylianWolfo> this boss is great
[1:13:54] <megatokyofan666> to be fair, the dragons are leaving a child to fix their own issues.
[1:13:55] <ruschcoil> concept art also makes for great unlockables
[1:14:00] <Samex_Comex> They are 3d scalies
[1:14:01] <+EyeFarted> "I'ma build an oven just for him!"
[1:14:01] <%Too_Much_Nukie> The boss is easier to kill than these dogs.
[1:14:02] <+thegreenbenis> They looked fine in the original
[1:14:04] <+whiskywolfe> The notorious Toasty
[1:14:07] <laserbeaming> This boss is... Something
[1:14:09] <+jkunblade> no he doesn't lol
[1:14:11] <insaneintentionsyo> he's a dragon
[1:14:14] <ahaegotrigger> Yes
[1:14:14] <+masked_hero_lucky> Well yeah, he's the bad guy
[1:14:15] <+firmlygraspi1> at least he's confident
[1:14:15] <insaneintentionsyo> it's excused
[1:14:16] <CalderGaming> I mean, you're a dragon
[1:14:17] <zk_nails> he is a dragon
[1:14:18] <+lethallylactic> Dragons really do be like that tho
[1:14:29] <+masked_hero_lucky> Yes
[1:14:31] <ahaegotrigger> YEs LUL
[1:14:31] <GabeGrimm> Spyro prepares to break the Geneva convention
[1:14:31] <%Too_Much_Nukie> Yes
[1:14:41] <conchubar11> dragons are literally the apex predator in this game. how else are they supposed to act?
[1:14:43] <+jkunblade> paiS
[1:14:48] <ThisGamingDragon> Euphamysims don't exist guys
[1:14:50] <ahaegotrigger> the details they added
[1:14:52] <%Too_Much_Nukie> Spyro is a psychopath.
[1:15:03] <+lethallylactic> Kappa
[1:15:05] <questionmarktimes2> LUL
[1:15:07] <%Too_Much_Nukie> That's the game saving.
[1:15:07] <+firmlygraspi1> this game assumes that violence is good. and it's right!

[1:15:07] <Triblade1992> Plague No
[1:15:09] <+sleepy_rinea> yes

[1:15:10] <+arancet> now i want to see plague's concept for a kiddie game
[1:15:11] <+masked_hero_lucky> Yeah
[1:15:11] <$pennykettle_> correct
[1:15:11] <laserbeaming> When she zaps you is a Checkpoiunt
[1:15:12] <JonnyJug> It is indeed
[1:15:13] <nademonkey1100> aicandJUDGE
[1:15:14] <+thegreenbenis> That's what it means
[1:15:14] <ahaegotrigger> yes
[1:15:19] <laserbeaming> There's Toasty
[1:15:19] <SirFancySwank> it is
[1:15:23] <%Too_Much_Nukie> Burn this man.
[1:15:24] <LunarRemix> IIRC she tells you that in the third game
[1:15:24] <+TIME_PUNCHER> tinkerbell claps
[1:15:25] <cap_bon> checkpoint jizz
[1:15:27] <+EyeFarted> Plague knows his audience
[1:15:32] <KaiserMario> Plague figuring out the inner workings of this pre-historic game
[1:15:34] <ScreamLord> @PlagueOfGripes That's exactly what the Fairy Zap is
[1:15:40] <+thegreenbenis> This guy is weirdly intimitdating.
[1:15:40] <SilverRoddo> “Life bar appears at the bottom”
[1:15:41] <%Too_Much_Nukie> Spyro is basically Trogdor.
[1:15:42] <+OnwardEch0> damn thats cute
[1:16:05] <insaneintentionsyo> what's your favorite Police song?
[1:16:06] <%Too_Much_Nukie> If you defeat him without getting hit by him you get a cheevo.
[1:16:06] <+lethallylactic> LUL
[1:16:09] <biomegabear> have you ever used a scythe on the farm plague
[1:16:12] <CursedNobleman> nobody uses the roll. maybe speedrunners?
[1:16:15] <+masked_hero_lucky> Bosses in Spyro 1 are barely a thing, still I love this game
[1:16:21] <dildozerfred> LUL
[1:16:35] <%Too_Much_Nukie> F
[1:16:40] <ahaegotrigger> LUL

[1:16:59] <tolloponik> That was it?
[1:17:04] <+masked_hero_lucky> The great scythe
[1:17:05] <SirFancySwank> missed a gem
[1:17:06] <ScreamLord> @PlagueOfGripes Spyro 1 bosses barely qualify as such. SOme of them don't even fight back
[1:17:11] <+TheEvaFreak> no
[1:17:14] <+TIME_PUNCHER> Bringer of Plagues
[1:17:17] <CalderGaming> that's what combine harvesters are for right?
[1:17:18] <%Too_Much_Nukie> I think you missed gems.
[1:17:19] <Doublemint_Dave_> you should start using a scythe
[1:17:19] <ahaegotrigger> you missed one green gem
[1:17:21] <insaneintentionsyo> oof

[1:17:27] <Coystick> Close enuff
[1:17:28] <+TheEvaFreak> you can go to next wrold
[1:17:30] <Triblade1992> Grim Reaper scythe from Grim Adventure of Billy and Mandy is the stereotype you are thinking of
[1:17:32] <SirFancySwank> waterfall area has a secret
[1:17:33] <+whiskywolfe> You used a sickle, not a scythe
[1:17:33] <DillionPHCO> I saw the big scythe used in the Crucible movie adaptation
[1:17:34] <+masked_hero_lucky> I think all you need is 10 dragons if you want to go to the next hub
[1:17:34] <ahaegotrigger> now go to the WAR ZONE
[1:17:36] <biomegabear> ballon

[1:17:55] <conchubar11> the door is a part of the landscape 4Head

[1:19:42] <$pennykettle_> did titan have joker scars?
[1:19:43] <ahaegotrigger> Gems
[1:19:49] <%Too_Much_Nukie> Gnasty Gnorc turned all the gems into monsters.
[1:19:56] <cap_bon> Nah i dont feel like it Titan.
[1:19:56] <Triblade1992> "We can't be bothered to actually help you" - Lazy dragon fucks
[1:19:57] <biomegabear> gems are enemies
[1:19:59] <%Too_Much_Nukie> That's why you get gems for killing the enemies.
[1:20:03] <DillionPHCO> How did he know the treasure was stolen? He's just been there in a hallway
[1:20:03] <conchubar11> inb4 plague makes his next gripes vid on this series
[1:20:07] <ahaegotrigger> they used to be gems but Gnasty Gnorc turned them into soldiers
[1:20:07] <Pouch_cotato> the real treasure is the friends we make along the way
[1:20:10] <SirFancySwank> the gems turned into the enemies
[1:20:11] <laserbeaming> idk what he means by Turned Against Us. Maybe the enemies are Gems given Life

[1:22:47] <ahaegotrigger> All Dragons are
[1:22:47] <biomegabear> human mouth butterfly is in a later spyro game
[1:22:49] <Triblade1992> what part of yes are you not getting?
[1:22:53] <Doomstar16> The dragons are all weak. Other wise they wouldn't be imprisoned.
[1:22:55] <ruschcoil> Discount Aku-Aku
[1:22:56] <TreesDontTalk> Bitch ain't got no legs
[1:22:57] <AlanJoestar> Spyro its a prequel to Seath
[1:23:02] <Coystick> Think about it, Spyro did the diagetic health bar way before Dead Space
[1:23:03] <+SirGO0SE> same :)
[1:23:09] <+lethallylactic> He'll show WHAT to us? monkaS
[1:23:10] <SilverRoddo> I want to see a huge Star Wars 9 end-battle with a bunch of dragons at during the finale of this game.
[1:23:10] <ahaegotrigger> show us what?
[1:23:14] <+jkunblade> yes :(
[1:23:16] <Twad_Feu> So.. he's a smuggler
[1:23:16] <ahaegotrigger> monkaS
[1:23:17] <ralanost> I mean, he is literally a young dragon. A teenager at best, but more likely a pre-teen
[1:23:18] <nademonkey1100> sounds like extortion to me
[1:23:20] <%Too_Much_Nukie> Oh damn you don't have enough. If you did the secret flying level you'd probably have 1200 already.
[1:23:22] <CursedNobleman> uggh, this level
[1:23:22] <Srthunda> just wait until you see money bags
[1:23:22] <Coystick> Blow it up

[1:23:43] <TreesDontTalk> Ain't even got legs
[1:23:46] <+Metballs> Of course there is
[1:23:47] <$pennykettle_> I think if you hold down the shoulder buttons, Sparx points toward the nearest gems
[1:24:01] <laserbeaming> @jellssssss20 probably! I think I can find if I look for it
[1:24:13] <Doomstar16> YOU'RE BEATING THE VIDEO GAME.
[1:24:15] <%Too_Much_Nukie> Child me couldn't figure that out on their own.

[1:24:25] <KaiserMario> Paige couldn't figure that out...
[1:24:26] <Daxalog> A cacti
[1:24:34] <SleepyMaribo> the cannon can break them
[1:24:35] <%Too_Much_Nukie> Shoot it with the cannon.
[1:24:35] <SirFancySwank> use cannon
[1:24:46] <+Scevda> This is truly the great dark souls playthrough of our time.
[1:24:58] <%Too_Much_Nukie> Dragons are weird like that.
[1:25:00] <Doomstar16> Your dragon fire is weak.
[1:25:10] <$pennykettle_> thats so weird, why do they regrow? They break in the original
[1:25:14] <+JonWhoLovesFlatWomen> aw they used to shake the soot off
[1:25:15] <%Too_Much_Nukie> The sequel doubles down on that.
[1:25:19] <ahaegotrigger> its Norc
[1:25:21] <ahaegotrigger> and yes
[1:25:22] <%Too_Much_Nukie> Gnorc.

[1:27:02] <+Garden_Hills> plague just tilted his head like DAta
[1:27:15] <+Garden_Hills> hes so confuzzled
[1:27:22] <%Too_Much_Nukie> Charging doesn't work on large enemies.
[1:27:23] <+lethallylactic> It works against little enemies usally.
[1:27:26] <Doublemint_Dave_> LOL
[1:27:27] <+Scevda> My school cafeteria ladies were nice
[1:27:27] <@Nightbot> Plague is a youtube animator and also streams at https://picarto.tv/Plague . Also: t-shirts! http://goo.gl/lze8QO
[1:27:28] <ahaegotrigger> yep
[1:27:29] <+cursedwithadhd> karen and her simp
[1:27:31] <biomegabear> charge is for smaller enemies
[1:27:33] <Coystick> If they're wearing Metal: Charge, if they're Huge: Fire
[1:27:33] <+lethallylactic> LUL
[1:27:37] <Triblade1992> Ah Dark Souls 2: Where the Ganks are many and the level design is shit
[1:27:37] <Doomstar16> Still think this is a game for little babies?
[1:27:37] <+jkunblade> googoo gahgah. babies first video game
[1:27:38] <$pennykettle_> the combat rules are really basic. charging doesnt work against big enemies, fire doesnt work against metal
[1:27:40] <whittacre> they have an audio queue
[1:27:44] <+lethallylactic> She hit you first LUL
[1:27:47] <jellssssss20> Metal = fire
[1:27:49] <%Too_Much_Nukie> You can but it glitched.
[1:27:52] <+acejwilliams> its such a pleasant surprise to see your face.
[1:27:58] <ahaegotrigger> youre supposed to
[1:28:01] <%Too_Much_Nukie> Probably because they were mid-animation.
[1:28:03] <jellssssss20> but only sometimes and not usually
[1:28:12] <SilverRoddo> Oh, i thought charge attack, was a big flame ball.
[1:28:12] <+thegreenbenis> Plague abuses women (Again)
[1:28:30] <%Too_Much_Nukie> You can shoot meteors in the third game but only with a powerup.
[1:28:54] <Doomstar16> Overshot it.
[1:29:06] <laserbeaming> I think triangle will stop the flight
[1:29:07] <biomegabear> triangle drops you
[1:29:07] <%Too_Much_Nukie> You can press Y to instantly drop down if you need to break your momentum.
[1:29:31] <%Too_Much_Nukie> That's Doctor Shemp

[1:30:09] <+Garden_Hills> draagons are all about turf wars

[1:30:16] <@CrankyVT> they were all generic

[1:32:34] <%Too_Much_Nukie> You have to hit him in the spin.
[1:32:34] <conchubar11> it was a children's platformer in the 90's, what more do ya want

[1:34:49] <TreesDontTalk> No
[1:34:51] <+dowmein> not every game is dark souls, plague
[1:34:53] <$pennykettle_> dark souls 2ing it, need magic feather
[1:34:57] <whittacre> just use homeward bone
[1:34:58] <laserbeaming> it's an old game
[1:34:59] <conchubar11> again, childrens platformer from the nineties @PlagueOfGripes
[1:35:01] <TreesDontTalk> Dark Souls wasn't invented yet Plague
[1:35:01] <jellssssss20> Press start and leave level lmao
[1:35:09] <@CrankyVT> its a game from 1998 after all
[1:35:11] <SilverRoddo> It’s no Skyrim dungeon.
[1:35:13] <+Scevda> Everything is dark souls in journalism @dowmein
[1:35:24] <laserbeaming> The Ecliupse is still menacing
[1:35:27] <jellssssss20> Jeez, I'm from 1998
[1:35:29] <+thegreenbenis> Game is old enough to drink.
[1:35:31] <$pennykettle_> replaying part of the level you just 100% is content
[1:35:33] <biomegabear> is spyro edgy?
[1:35:45] <%Too_Much_Nukie> Yeah everything respawns when you leave a world.
[1:35:52] <SilverRoddo> I mean, the eclipse was cool looking.
[1:36:01] <%Too_Much_Nukie> No this game will never have new abilities.
[1:36:10] <@CrankyVT> Nah, you've got what you have
[1:36:11] <%Too_Much_Nukie> 2 and 3 added that but this one is very simple.
[1:36:12] <TreesDontTalk> "Respawning enemies, must be like Dark Souls" smiffActually
[1:36:13] <$pennykettle_> even in later games when you unlock new "abilities" it isnt even quite abilities
[1:36:20] <jellssssss20> Oh your dragon fly died
[1:36:20] <KaiserMario> It's for children
[1:36:24] <+jiggy_snipe> it's clever for children
[1:36:30] <CalderGaming> you should play Antichamber
[1:36:40] <+thegreenbenis> It's clever if you're 10.
[1:36:42] <LunarRemix> The first is kind of for babies but the second and the third one ramp it up quite a bit
[1:36:46] <KaiserMario> It's complicated for Paige
[1:36:56] <Shadope342> into the effluvial grime
[1:36:57] <JailShmixRemix> This game was pretty clever when I was 9
[1:36:58] <%Too_Much_Nukie> LUL
[1:37:01] <+zooeymainbtw> it can be
[1:37:01] <+gaunteyes> oh god, antichamber. who needs eucidian space
[1:37:04] <Triblade1992> welcome to a ps1 era game
[1:37:05] <biomegabear> yeah that's spyro 1 alright
[1:37:07] <jellssssss20> burn this village to the ground spyro
[1:37:09] <Doomstar16> Let us all chortle at plauges small mistake.
[1:37:12] <@CrankyVT> he's got some serious resistance when you try to course correct or turn him
[1:37:15] <$pennykettle_> oh theres a fortnite dance in this
[1:37:21] <+Scevda> Lets get to Alida's keep!
[1:37:22] <+masked_hero_lucky> If you fall in water near a ledge you can jump to, you can jump out of the water
[1:37:24] <KaiserMario> Like Dark Souls
[1:37:36] <SilverRoddo> Spyro is like bicycle controls.
[1:37:36] <Doomstar16> He's a four legged being. Maybe that's why he has such a hard time turning.
[1:37:37] <jellssssss20> Blight town
[1:37:45] <zenozine> "Everyone imagines killing children. It's fun." ~Plague 2015
[1:37:47] <+zooeymainbtw> crash do it better, crash do it all day
[1:37:48] <conchubar11> not in this game, you can't swim until the next one
[1:37:52] <whittacre> plague didn't have any more health when he fell in
[1:38:05] <biomegabear> loading used to be longer, got patched
[1:38:07] <nademonkey1100> ohh a flasher
[1:38:11] <%Too_Much_Nukie> This level is neat.
[1:38:18] <SilverRoddo> The feel of long load times.
[1:38:22] <+Scevda> JUMP
[1:38:23] <%Too_Much_Nukie> Charge him.
[1:38:24] <+thegreenbenis> Stibbity stab
[1:38:28] <@CrankyVT> charge into the knife
[1:38:28] <+jiggy_snipe> footsies
[1:38:29] <@CrankyVT> no fear
[1:38:30] <+lethallylactic> You can charge little metal guys
[1:38:30] <Triblade1992> charge him
[1:38:31] <+Garden_Hills> bum rush
[1:38:32] <jellssssss20> head beats knife
[1:38:33] <+zooeymainbtw> just charge 4head
[1:38:36] <thesanderdc> charge him
[1:38:38] <KaiserMario> Dark Souls bait him
[1:38:40] <%Too_Much_Nukie> Charge him with your dragon horns.
[1:38:42] <$pennykettle_> I have 2 attacks and 1 of them doesnt work FeelsBadMan what do I do
[1:38:44] <ninetales8491> bat man fire proof cape LUL
[1:38:46] <tolloponik> Knife Culture is strong
[1:38:51] <TreesDontTalk> lmao
[1:38:51] <Firemane1279> charge him
[1:38:55] <+masked_hero_lucky> Spyro's charge is typically faster than attacks that come from enemies
[1:38:58] <SilverRoddo> Press the Call out Challenge button.
[1:38:59] <TreesDontTalk> choices choices
[1:39:06] <biomegabear> it used to be faster, the charge
[1:39:09] <+masked_hero_lucky> So you can just ram metal guys in most cases
[1:39:16] <Shardlab> "There are other elements besides fire, child."
[1:39:17] <+Scevda> fuck that cactus in particular
[1:39:24] <ThisGamingDragon> GAME DESIGN
[1:39:25] <Tebrial> 99% of the time small enemies= rush them large enemies = flame Sometimes they mix it up, but thats it most of the time.
[1:39:35] <+Scevda> Newman killers
[1:39:37] <KaiserMario> They are gonna kill Newman!
[1:39:39] <Shardlab> Compy
[1:39:39] <+Scevda> thats what I called them
[1:39:42] <Triblade1992> Newman killers
[1:39:42] <$pennykettle_> velociraptor?
[1:39:42] <cursedcharley> Utah raptors?
[1:39:50] <+midnightq2> dilothosaurus?
[1:39:55] <+thegreenbenis> @PlagueOfGripes Dilo
[1:39:57] <+Garden_Hills> dilapasaurs or however
[1:39:57] <moonsaber99> Dilophosaurus
[1:39:58] <biomegabear> kelptiposaurs
[1:39:59] <@DCN2049> dilophosaurus
[1:40:02] <C24U> Well some lizards can shoot blood out their eyes
[1:40:03] <+midnightq2> dilophosaurus
[1:40:05] <SilverRoddo> Dilo
[1:40:06] <TreesDontTalk> KomodoHype smiffBeef
[1:40:14] <Shardlab> I can't remember the full name, but they called them Compeys I think
[1:40:27] <@DCN2049> also, I cannot be held solely responsible for anything I did
[1:40:31] <Shardlab> They swarmed a guy and ate him alive in JP 2
[1:40:46] <+EyeFarted> jump in the pot and cook yourself
[1:40:52] <Triblade1992> I think so yes
[1:40:55] <dadeaner> n64 only had 1 analog stick
[1:41:00] <+thegreenbenis> @PlagueOfGripes The little spitting dinos were like 9 feet tall in the book
[1:41:14] <nademonkey1100> what
[1:41:24] <+lethallylactic> 🤔
[1:41:25] <TreesDontTalk> It's fine
[1:41:30] <CalderGaming> flame not hot enough because you baby
[1:41:31] <%Rezca> its super effective in Pokemon
[1:41:31] <%Too_Much_Nukie> Shhhhhh
[1:41:33] <ninetales8491> yes it does as long as it gets hot enough
[1:41:34] <King_Lethargy> Don't bring logic into this
[1:41:35] <+SirGO0SE> fire is super effective against steel yes
[1:41:36] <Triblade1992> unless you are Toph aka the Melon Lord
[1:41:36] <TreesDontTalk> don't listen to the dragon Plague
[1:41:42] <SunsetJack> His flame probably ain't hot enough lol
[1:41:45] <ThisGamingDragon> Shut up Plague
[1:41:46] <TreesDontTalk> just keep doing what you're doing
[1:41:49] <KaiserMario> What if it's Vibranium?
[1:41:49] <+Metballs> Armour was never made to withstand hits
[1:41:50] <cursedcharley> Cook the enemy in their armor. Totally brutal
[1:42:03] <Firemane1279> flames won't work. but FIRE will. Kappa
[1:42:05] <+Garden_Hills> hes a low and slow kind of barbecue kinf of dragon
[1:42:06] <Twad_Feu> We arent playing Spyro - The anti-tank dragon
[1:42:08] <LunarRemix> There's tons of those dudes in the later games
[1:42:13] <thesanderdc> N you don't, just use it more you'll get used to it
[1:42:13] <%Too_Much_Nukie> I remember in the Elijah Wood reboot you could burn enemies in their armor.
[1:42:22] <Triblade1992> "Flame should be the most effective against metal" - Plague forgetting about Toph and her metal bending
[1:42:28] <+zooeymainbtw> he was too short, thats the actual answer
[1:42:28] <Samex_Comex> It missed
[1:42:32] <%Too_Much_Nukie> Yeah he's the chosen one.
[1:42:32] <+masked_hero_lucky> Nah, Spyro's small so he missed
[1:42:32] <Aydarkzero> not in this trilogy
[1:42:32] <+pittpanther84> He was to smol
[1:42:35] <+Scevda> He was smol
[1:42:36] <+thegreenbenis> Too short.
[1:42:37] <ahaegotrigger> hes just a weak little bitch Dragon
[1:42:38] <Shardlab> Game mechanics and logic aren't compatible
[1:42:39] <Daxalog> He was just too short
[1:42:39] <SunsetJack> He was too small to be noticed...?
[1:42:41] <%Too_Much_Nukie> Spyro is the only Purple Dragon.
[1:42:42] <nademonkey1100> because spyro is a bitch
[1:42:42] <Firaga64> He's too small.
[1:42:44] <Zebroneath> He was too short
[1:42:44] <biomegabear> this 1st game tries to make you charge of the cliff with enemies
[1:42:48] <thesanderdc> Lol in the third one he's the only one to fit through the hole
[1:42:50] <cursedcharley> He was so short the spell went over him
[1:42:51] <+thegreenbenis> Literally it was just too short.
[1:42:54] <$pennykettle_> there was a chosen one thing in the grimdark reboot where Elijah Wood voiced spyro and Sparx by Billy West
[1:42:55] <ThisGamingDragon> Cuz he's literally too small to get hit
[1:42:56] <laserbeaming> I think he just got overlooked for being a baby
[1:42:58] <+Garden_Hills> Smol
[1:43:00] <whirly25> he's purble
[1:43:03] <C24U> It's actually very mundane and petty
[1:43:08] <SirFancySwank> no prohecy in the original trilogy
[1:43:09] <hypersongi> The prophesy spoke of "the short one"
[1:43:19] <kingra> Pat?
[1:43:23] <Pouch_cotato> he was too busy sniffing his own farts and the spell missed
[1:43:26] <Triblade1992> The prophecy is in the reboot version of Spyro
[1:43:33] <+SirGO0SE> i baby
[1:43:35] <fedorawalrus> In the reboot he was special because he's purple.
[1:43:38] <+IMDRanged> I did like character Cynder from the Elijah Woods Spyro trilogy.
[1:43:46] <%Too_Much_Nukie> There was a remake with Elijah Wood yeah.
[1:43:46] <+masked_hero_lucky> Everything after the first three blows
[1:43:48] <$pennykettle_> the studio sold the rights, after 3 they go down the shitter
[1:43:48] <biomegabear> there's more games and they're not good
[1:43:49] <dadeaner> skylanders is one
[1:43:49] <+thegreenbenis> There were crappy ps2 games that sucked. @PlagueOfGripes
[1:43:53] <+zooeymainbtw> there was a reboot where the creepy sex stuff comes from
[1:43:56] <+JonWhoLovesFlatWomen> a couple of really bad ones
[1:43:57] <+rawringkhris> like 8 games?
[1:43:59] <laserbeaming> Yes, there's a second, edgier trilogy that kind of rips off God of War
[1:44:01] <+jkunblade> 3 good games :)
[1:44:03] <+rawringkhris> 10?
[1:44:09] <LunarRemix> There was a really weird PS2 reboot and tons of GBA bad games
[1:44:09] <+thegreenbenis> YES
[1:44:10] <cursedcharley> Oh yeah
[1:44:10] <dadeaner> yup
[1:44:11] <%Too_Much_Nukie> The Elijah Wood trilogy had a prophecy where Spyro was a special boy who could master all four elements.
[1:44:11] <$pennykettle_> oh, plague would like Cynder LUL
[1:44:13] <Srthunda> yup
[1:44:14] <ThisGamingDragon> Spyro 4 wen?
[1:44:15] <WizardofWazz> me on the left
[1:44:17] <Triblade1992> yes
[1:44:17] <$pennykettle_> ps2
[1:44:17] <dadeaner> yes
[1:44:18] <Shardlab> Yup
[1:44:19] <+JonWhoLovesFlatWomen> yes
[1:44:19] <thesanderdc> Dragon waif was cool
[1:44:20] <laserbeaming> yes
[1:44:21] <+thegreenbenis> Yes
[1:44:21] <SirFancySwank> yes
[1:44:22] <+TheNewZealandStory> i will never understand why writers are fixated on "chosen one" storylines
[1:44:22] <%Too_Much_Nukie> Yup.
[1:44:25] <ScreamLord> @PlagueOfGripes The OG Trilogy was yes
[1:44:28] <TreesDontTalk> Plague Skylanders lore run when???
[1:44:29] <biomegabear> spyro after the first 3 games they're worse than sonics bad games
[1:44:30] <+SirGO0SE> pretty sick at the time
[1:44:31] <Shardlab> PS2 games were more serious
[1:44:39] <laserbeaming> There was a bad PS2 game
[1:44:42] <Shardlab> I didn't get to play them
[1:44:43] <%Too_Much_Nukie> Spyro Way of the Dragonfly was at the tail end of the PS1's lifespan.
[1:44:46] <laserbeaming> but made by another dev
[1:44:46] <$pennykettle_> Didnt they get onto PS2 in the original 3 too?
[1:44:52] <%Too_Much_Nukie> Nope.
[1:44:56] <+thegreenbenis> YES
[1:44:56] <+Garden_Hills> toys
[1:44:59] <biomegabear> yes
[1:45:00] <ScreamLord> Yes
[1:45:00] <laserbeaming> It is
[1:45:00] <%Too_Much_Nukie> Yes.
[1:45:01] <$pennykettle_> the original amiibo @PlagueOfGripes
[1:45:03] <+jiggy_snipe> yes
[1:45:05] <Triblade1992> Skylanders started the toys for game stuff @PlagueOfGripes
[1:45:05] <+SirGO0SE> amiibo 2
[1:45:07] <fedorawalrus> Yup. A toys to life game.
[1:45:07] <Shardlab> Skylanders. "Toys to Life."
[1:45:08] <dadeaner> dlc in toys
[1:45:09] <Srthunda> It like amibos before amibos
[1:45:09] <+JonWhoLovesFlatWomen> you buy the toys and they work in video game
[1:45:09] <socratetris> Yes it was! but started as a Spyro Spinoff
[1:45:09] <+masked_hero_lucky> Toys to life games
[1:45:10] <SuperVaderMan> Worse amiibos
[1:45:13] <+arancet> game that uses amiibo things
[1:45:16] <ThisGamingDragon> plague will never understand the pain of being a Spyro fan since the PS1 days
[1:45:17] <+jiggy_snipe> Amiibos Origin
[1:45:18] <%Too_Much_Nukie> Skylanders was what gave Nintendo the idea for amiibos.
[1:45:25] <Shardlab> We used to have a whole section of them at my job
[1:45:26] <+IMDRanged> I forgot which one, but Chrstina Ricci was voicing Cynder
[1:45:27] <TreesDontTalk> FIREWORKS
[1:45:32] <$pennykettle_> Skylanders started the amiibo shit
[1:45:35] <ralphwiggum16> Plague, does it bother you that there aren't enough goblins in this game?
[1:45:36] <Shardlab> Then that section became Amiibos
[1:45:39] <tolloponik> the thing that gave nintendo the amiibo Idea
[1:45:40] <kylecoolperson> Spyro is actually the Dark Souls prequel
[1:45:43] <+SirGO0SE> ah didnt know they were first, nintendo was fast on that eh
[1:45:56] <biomegabear> spyro has a poor game quality beyond 3 games
[1:46:11] <laserbeaming> @kylecoolperson you see, Spyro linked the First Flame before Gwyn
[1:46:15] <Triblade1992> It was the "toys to life" fad that went on
[1:46:18] <ralphwiggum16> it's totally breaking my immersion.
[1:46:22] <%Too_Much_Nukie> The Elijah Wood trilogy isn't all bad.
[1:46:43] <$pennykettle_> there was going to be spyro movies as well? Long long ago
[1:46:47] <C24U> Feel like a Wyrm?
[1:46:47] <+Garden_Hills> feel like a bitch
[1:46:48] <biomegabear> yes but goo big
[1:46:49] <%Too_Much_Nukie> Yeah they can.
[1:46:50] <Shardlab> So.... Gargoyles?
[1:46:51] <+zooeymainbtw> they can, spyro just baby
[1:46:51] <laserbeaming> OH RIGHT, Elijah Wood was involved in the second trilogy
[1:46:51] <+Scevda> Feels probably like Seethe does-like a bitch
[1:46:53] <+masked_hero_lucky> Spyro can fly weirdly enough
[1:46:54] <+rawringkhris> dragons can fly
[1:46:54] <%Too_Much_Nukie> Spyro is too small to fly.
[1:46:55] <laserbeaming> I forgot
[1:46:55] <TreesDontTalk> Spyro can fly
[1:46:59] <@Nightbot> @midnightq2 -> cmonBruh [stop spamming emotes] [warning]
[1:47:13] <%Too_Much_Nukie> Spyro can only fly with magic help. You haven't gone to any of the flying levels yet.
[1:47:14] <sosuke5> yeeeeesss...?
[1:47:19] <+rawringkhris> He doesn't fly under his own power
[1:47:21] <King_Lethargy> He is bab
[1:47:21] <+thegreenbenis> BABY WINGS
[1:47:24] <biomegabear> wings small
[1:47:25] <%Too_Much_Nukie> His wings aren't fully grown in.
[1:47:26] <thesanderdc> Flying is just gay falling anyway
[1:47:29] <C24U> Having Hollow bones help you fly
[1:47:29] <TreesDontTalk> He literally flies in certain levels
[1:47:31] <Triblade1992> I think it's his wings that are too small
[1:47:31] <Brainworm205> him is baby
[1:47:31] <+CrookedSpiral> I think they meant too young
[1:47:35] <+arcielardor> I think the bigger ones fly with magic.
[1:47:38] <SirFancySwank> lacks flying magic
[1:47:39] <JonnyJug> Not magical enough
[1:47:41] <Brainworm205> tiny bby wings
[1:47:43] <fedorawalrus> Not fully grown wings.
[1:47:43] <Srthunda> he flies in levels when he gets the magic
[1:47:45] <hypersongi> its all magic?
[1:47:47] <+thegreenbenis> Tiny wings
[1:47:49] <laserbeaming> He doesn't have enough wingspan, but neither do the other dragons though
[1:47:50] <$Rivalshotzgp> These people haven’t seen a f104
[1:47:51] <+Scevda> Eli returns to why he hates dragons
[1:47:51] <+Garden_Hills> his dick is small and so are his wings
[1:47:51] <$pennykettle_> this also had GBA spinoffs
[1:47:53] <+thegreenbenis> Spyro is a winglet
[1:47:57] <+Scevda> Its timeless
[1:47:57] <TreesDontTalk> HE CAN FLY
[1:47:58] <%Too_Much_Nukie> I think one of the dragons you rescue mentions it.
[1:48:00] <ralphwiggum16> who made those enemy's clothing?
[1:48:01] <%JJCheeker> JJCheeker subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 18 months, currently on a 18 month streak! HONK HONK!
[1:48:13] <SilverRoddo> His wings can’t get enough lift.
[1:48:15] <%JJCheeker> yo
[1:48:18] <TreesDontTalk> HE FLIES BETWEEN LEVELS AND IN CERTAIN LEVELS
[1:48:26] <TreesDontTalk> NotLikeThis NotLikeThis NotLikeThis
[1:48:27] <dadeaner> tums festival
[1:48:29] <JayCantDo> Pepto Bismol
[1:48:34] <socratetris> I recommend Gaviscon
[1:48:39] <+Scevda> Egg acquited
[1:48:41] <+thegreenbenis> Gotta be good at the nascar
[1:48:45] <+masked_hero_lucky> I believe if you keep chasing a thief they actually slow down
[1:48:48] <Brainworm205> yea he flies in special levels because of magic. he have bb wings
[1:48:49] <biomegabear> I used to think those guys were sonics
[1:48:55] <+Scevda> He tired
[1:49:00] <laserbeaming> V I D E O G A M E
[1:49:03] <ralphwiggum16> i fucking hate spyro
[1:49:06] <+SinisterBroccoli> go make a baby plague
[1:49:08] <$pennykettle_> jesus christ there was a cancelled spyro game called Spyro Ever After where he meets fairy tales like little red riding hood
[1:49:11] <Pouch_cotato> he uses updrafts etc
[1:49:11] <dadeaner> just puke :)
[1:49:15] <+kingboro> more like gliding since he doesn't flap his wings
[1:49:21] <SilverRoddo> Stretch break
[1:49:23] <Brainworm205> he get tired too fast. thats why the flight levels have a time limit lol
[1:49:24] <+Scevda> Edgy
[1:49:25] <$pennykettle_> yes
[1:49:26] <%Too_Much_Nukie> The exit gates in levels give Spyro enough magic to fly, and in levels where Spyro flies around it's because he passes through gates.
[1:49:27] <+Scevda> still smol
[1:49:29] <$pennykettle_> YES
[1:49:30] <+JonWhoLovesFlatWomen> ew
[1:49:30] <+SinisterBroccoli> There's fanart of that
[1:49:30] <+thegreenbenis> EDGY AND YEAH
[1:49:31] <cursedcharley> No. That's fanfics
[1:49:32] <laserbeaming> OH
[1:49:34] <%JJCheeker> never played spyro
[1:49:34] <$pennykettle_> her name is Cynder
[1:49:36] <biomegabear> girlfriend yes buff mo
[1:49:37] <King_Lethargy> You're half right
[1:49:37] <Pouch_cotato> he gets meaner looking,
[1:49:38] <thesanderdc> Dragon waifu
[1:49:39] <Triblade1992> Cynder
[1:49:42] <%Too_Much_Nukie> He gets a dragon girlfriend in the Elijah Wood games.
[1:49:45] <fedorawalrus> The girlfriend is Cynder
[1:49:52] <%Too_Much_Nukie> And he learns kung fu in the games I shit you not.
[1:49:59] <Pouch_cotato> she's a goth gf too
[1:50:05] <$pennykettle_> she has a spiky collar
[1:50:12] <$pennykettle_> and shes a slave to the evil dark villain
[1:50:16] <laserbeaming> maybe
[1:50:19] <$pennykettle_> so shes morally grey
[1:50:20] <%JJCheeker> Is the Jurassic park spitters
[1:50:21] <biomegabear> sometimes ge,s
[1:50:22] <+Scevda> Mothra reigns supreme
[1:50:24] <+Draylle> \
[1:50:27] <%Too_Much_Nukie> All the enemies you fight are made out of gems so maybe?
[1:50:28] <Aydarkzero> Butterflies = Humanity when you think about it
[1:50:30] <+EyeFarted> Butterflies or cake
[1:50:33] <ralphwiggum16> are we all just made of butterflies?
[1:50:36] <+SinisterBroccoli> maybe you're turning them into butterflies to be eaten alive by a bug?
[1:50:50] <+arcielardor> he's afraid to fly because the curries may sexually assault him.
[1:50:50] <+thegreenbenis> What if there is an Alex Jones dragon?
[1:50:52] <JailShmixRemix> Butterflies are made of cake
[1:50:57] <+arcielardor> furries
[1:51:04] <biomegabear> crash aged worse
[1:51:05] <+arcielardor> goddamn autocorrect
[1:51:05] <+Scevda> Gotta be focus
[1:51:07] <+SinisterBroccoli> crash is good if you get mad and yell a lot
[1:51:09] <socratetris> DOES BUTTERFLY IS MATTER? THE SHOCK YOU DO WONT BELIEVE OF ATOMS!
[1:51:12] <dadeaner> they fuked the hitboxes
[1:51:15] <%Too_Much_Nukie> Crash is great but it's really bad to learn on-stream.
[1:51:16] <SirFancySwank> first one is quite rough
[1:51:22] <+jiggy_snipe> sounds like Crash LUL
[1:51:22] <Aydarkzero> it's not that bad they fixed some of it
[1:51:24] <+masked_hero_lucky> Crash has a weird hitbox in the remakes, still good games though
[1:51:25] <+thegreenbenis> The hitboxs are fucked.
[1:51:26] <Brainworm205> so lewd Elora fanart when? just remembered she's in Spyro 2 lol
[1:51:27] <TreesDontTalk> MercyWing1 EntropyWins MercyWing2 butterflies
[1:51:28] <Triblade1992> Crash isn't for stream purposes. Crash remake I think has better hitboxes than the originla thtough
[1:51:32] <cap_bon> the hit box changed from a box to a cylinder so you sort slip of edges
[1:51:33] <LunarRemix> The physics is a little different than the original while the map is mostly the same, leading to some problems.
[1:51:33] <+zooeymainbtw> its fine, just weird if you're used to the old controls
[1:51:34] <$pennykettle_> The crash redesign is also ugly as sin compared to the upcoming game
[1:51:42] <+SinisterBroccoli> already a thing Brainworm205
[1:51:53] <ralphwiggum16> i hate how spyro just kills all sorts of shit but he's like "uuuuuh i'm a cut widdle dragon."
[1:52:02] <Brainworm205> @SinisterBroccoli did Plague make some???
[1:52:08] <+masked_hero_lucky> Crash is definitely harder than Spyro
[1:52:12] <%JJCheeker> BABBY game
[1:52:13] <biomegabear> crash looks better now than tattoo crash
[1:52:15] <%Too_Much_Nukie> The vultures freaked me out as a kid.
[1:52:17] <+SinisterBroccoli> idk, it's definitely his thing
[1:52:18] <+buck_nastiest> do a barrel roll!
[1:52:24] <dadeaner> yeah the guys doing crash 4 did this game

[1:52:55] <+TheNewZealandStory> ew that was roger craig smith
[1:53:02] <+SinisterBroccoli> Didn't they make an official artwork of Spyro as an adult dragon in this style?
[1:53:04] <%Too_Much_Nukie> The whirlwind is a Dark Souls shourtcut.
[1:53:05] <+EyeFarted> I hate their voices... too human
[1:53:06] <+TheNewZealandStory> i need to wash my ears out now
[1:53:21] <TreesDontTalk> The last one literally told you to attack the boss' backside @plagueofgripes
[1:53:24] <+gaunteyes> dragons are wise, you see. ..
[1:53:26] <biomegabear> @sinisterbroccoli yeah in the box art of the manuel
[1:53:26] <Triblade1992> He's Plague's favorite dragon now
[1:53:46] <%Too_Much_Nukie> Yeah for sure.

[1:54:16] <JonnyJug> GREEN!
[1:54:16] <+SinisterBroccoli> it was a cool concept
[1:54:20] <+skylerpilot> I wouldn't say Overlord was bad
[1:54:21] <Aydarkzero> that's exactly how i played through the Spyro games i rented them until i bought Spyro 2 & 3
[1:54:21] <Triblade1992> never played it
[1:54:29] <theidealheight> oh shit man, i love this game
[1:54:29] <Brainworm205> they're definitely fun little games. pretty easy platinums too. i plat'ed them and said "huh, that was cool" and moved on
[1:54:30] <tolloponik> heard of it
[1:54:36] <+EyeFarted> hahaha
[1:54:36] <+arcielardor> overlord
[1:54:41] <+Garden_Hills> pikmin but armor
[1:54:42] <Aydarkzero> monkaS
[1:54:44] <+arcielardor> it's overlord
[1:54:46] <Twad_Feu> rown minions lootin'
[1:54:49] <+thegreenbenis> Overlord.
[1:54:50] <+skylerpilot> they are a bit awkward for sure but pretty fun
[1:54:51] <dadeaner> colored you say?
[1:54:52] <biomegabear> pikmin souls
[1:54:57] <+SinisterBroccoli> I never played the game, didn't know it was pikmin
[1:55:16] <%Too_Much_Nukie> You could fuck hot ladies.
[1:55:26] <ScreamLord> Overlord
[1:55:28] <dadeaner> i think you didnt light the fire under one of the pots
[1:55:35] <%Too_Much_Nukie> There is.
[1:55:40] <%Too_Much_Nukie> Behind the starting area is some gems.
[1:55:41] <whittacre> the back edge
[1:55:52] <+TIME_PUNCHER> This new Pokemon Mystery Dungeon game looks sick
[1:55:55] <%Too_Much_Nukie> Getting 100% here is kind of annoying because of that area.
[1:56:05] <Brainworm205> why does everyone keep saying it's Overlord. he said he was talking about Overlord at the beginning lol. too funny
[1:56:12] <JonnyJug> Use Sparx
[1:56:14] <+skylerpilot> yeah its a lot like Pikmin, though the actually Overlord you play as can actually do things unlike Olimar
[1:56:17] <biomegabear> spare can tell you where gem is
[1:56:18] <ralphwiggum16> Plague, why are you playing this?
[1:56:19] <+thegreenbenis> I didn't hear him say that.
[1:56:25] <+EyeFarted> Check the boiling pot
[1:56:26] <SirFancySwank> sparks points in the diection of gems
[1:56:26] <Doublemint_Dave_> Baba is gem
[1:56:30] <+Scevda> pbbbt
[1:56:32] <+EyeFarted> pots
[1:56:38] <tolloponik> the pots
[1:56:39] <%Too_Much_Nukie> If you click the right stick Sparx points toward gems.
[1:56:46] <Brainworm205> @thegreenbenis haha its cool, i just kept giggling about it
[1:56:49] <theidealheight> no one told him about the gem locator?
[1:56:50] <+TIME_PUNCHER> "Spread out" - Commando Fairy

[1:59:17] <+Scevda> I wonder if thats remake only
[1:59:22] <+thegreenbenis> The original spyro on the ps1 didn't have that.
[1:59:26] <Brainworm205> the L3 will straight up get you 100% in every stage. very useful
[1:59:32] <+thegreenbenis> Kinda lewd
[1:59:36] <biomegabear> TOS
[1:59:37] <theidealheight> HUH...
[1:59:37] <jellssssss20> Dark souls = level does a loop? Lol

[1:59:47] <Triblade1992> fire
[1:59:48] <C24U> They use contraceptives?
[1:59:56] <dadeaner> gg
[1:59:59] <theidealheight> NICE 100%
[1:59:59] <SilverRoddo> It’s their culture?
[2:00:00] <+TIME_PUNCHER> they might use contraceptives you don't know
[2:00:03] <+thegreenbenis> They have contraceptive magic
[2:00:08] <KaiserMario> Having a hard time with this game for babies?
[2:00:09] <jellssssss20> 🔥
[2:00:12] <+byrtrael> damn I just 100%ed the whole trilogy and didn't know about L3 lmao
[2:00:13] <+Scevda> Get the plan-b fairies
[2:00:13] <whittacre> you have enough to leave now
[2:00:15] <LunarRemix> Nah they probably teleport the sperm away
[2:00:20] <%JJCheeker> Magic condom
[2:00:21] <LunarRemix> Like wizards do with their poop
[2:00:26] <+thegreenbenis> They telebort any babies
[2:00:29] <+TIME_PUNCHER> Bay-B-Gon spell
[2:00:39] <%JJCheeker> Morning after spell
[2:00:50] <%bettysharkface> Fetus deletus.
[2:00:52] <+SinisterBroccoli> You should do some cheat codes Plague
[2:01:20] <+TIME_PUNCHER> Dry Canyon? visiting more fairies huh
[2:01:26] <jellssssss20> Did the wizards created by the bigot who hates trans people just magic cum out of themselves like they magicked the poo?
[2:01:26] <%Too_Much_Nukie> He wanted 1200
[2:01:27] <whittacre> I thought it was 1200
[2:01:34] <Triblade1992> he just wanted 1200
[2:01:35] <laserbeaming> the balloon man wanted 1200
[2:01:41] <%Too_Much_Nukie> You have enough gems for the whole game iirc.
[2:01:45] <+SinisterBroccoli> it's the arms
[2:01:47] <+kingboro> he is not flapping his wings. i don't call that flying
[2:01:50] <+masked_hero_lucky> This isn't creepy, Skylanders Spyro is creepy
[2:01:52] <+jiggy_snipe> he lifts
[2:01:55] <+SinisterBroccoli> falling, with style
[2:01:58] <%Too_Much_Nukie> Unless you want the 100% completion ending.
[2:02:12] <%JJCheeker> They packin
[2:02:23] <SilverRoddo> Blunderbuss orcs
[2:02:38] <ScreamLord> @PlagueOfGripes Shield dudes can be charged through
[2:02:53] <slix3431> Spyro isn't furry I'mma kick you're nuts!
[2:03:03] <%Too_Much_Nukie> Yup
[2:03:13] <ahaegotrigger> I love how Plague is treating spyro like dark souls
[2:03:27] <ahaegotrigger> true
[2:03:31] <+Scevda> Draging that dragon dick around
[2:03:32] <+SinisterBroccoli> driven a lot of busses?
[2:03:34] <theidealheight> heres a tip, when your running only press left and right to turn, you dont need to hold forward
[2:03:37] <$pennykettle_> Really?? I think it has really fluid controls
[2:03:50] <DillionPHCO> You're welcome
[2:03:51] <%Rezca> Don Quixote?
[2:03:54] <KaiserMario> More like Quixote....
[2:03:55] <%Too_Much_Nukie> LUL
[2:03:55] <whittacre> he has interesting momentum
[2:03:56] <+thegreenbenis> Don Quixote
[2:03:57] <dadeaner> the lamentations of the women
[2:03:59] <%JJCheeker> interesting mustache
[2:04:12] <+SinisterBroccoli> this game is very slippery and I think this is part of the difficulty
[2:04:19] <KaiserMario> Trolon? Trojon... whatever
[2:04:23] <ahaegotrigger> the war Dragons should be jacked
[2:04:25] <+TIME_PUNCHER> Conan O'Dragon
[2:04:28] <Samex_Comex> Or at least a talk show host
[2:04:42] <+SirGO0SE> give them new names Eli
[2:05:06] <KaiserMario> Someone was in charge of the design, another in charge of placing them in the proper statues
[2:05:08] <DillionPHCO> I feel like they had to just come up with random looks for them considering the original they all looked the exact same
[2:05:15] <+BigHovo> Dragons were palate swaps of like 3 designs originally
[2:05:18] <Daxalog> I thought you were going to say Conan met you
[2:05:28] <SilverRoddo> They were shades
[2:05:32] <Twad_Feu> young ones probably don't know any better
[2:05:40] <+masked_hero_lucky> LUL
[2:05:41] <ScreamLord> @PlagueOfGripes In the OG Spyro 1 they had like 4 models for each dragon type and had even less personality. Only the ones that had full on conversations were slightly interesting. Also they were almost all voiced by the developers

[2:07:46] <LunarRemix> Her name's Zoe
[2:07:46] <jellssssss20> hellow2Poomkin here’s A lewd emote for that wonderful story lol

[2:08:08] <%Too_Much_Nukie> There's only one fairy. Her name is Zoe.
[2:08:11] <SirFancySwank> bara dragons better than fairies
[2:08:12] <1_Dusk> is spyro going to get anthrofied when he grows up too?

[2:08:56] <111111sagas111111> I'll have you know this is that scalie game, not furry thorwBaka
[2:08:58] <$pennykettle_> I imagine that works with any living thing?
[2:09:00] <C24U> Could you do that with other small mammals?
[2:09:01] <+ThomasOfTroy> Yes actually, I've seen the infographic
[2:09:03] <+JonWhoLovesFlatWomen> explain plz plague
[2:09:03] <%SlyKnuxRealist4> Vulture be like 'HELP PLEASE!' LUL

[2:09:17] <Meowbringer> more detail please.
[2:09:18] <%JJCheeker> Have you ever heard a rabbit scream
[2:09:19] <%Rezca> Helpful Plague life advice
[2:09:20] <DillionPHCO> Or at least don't tell anyone that you're doing it
[2:09:21] <OperatorJo_> nunchuck the rabbits to save time
[2:09:22] <SilverRoddo> Centripetal force.
[2:09:22] <SatoruMasamune> ...so that's a "no" on the bunny-chuks?
[2:09:24] <Shwepie> What if you love and take care of them until they die by natural causes, then sling them around?
[2:09:28] <ahaegotrigger> LUL
[2:09:29] <theidealheight> i wasnt considering it....
[2:09:30] <King_Lethargy> Make me a diagram
[2:09:31] <+TIME_PUNCHER> you can also skin it by pulling the skin on their back a certain way too @plagueofgripes
[2:09:35] <111111sagas111111> a hard stance you say?
[2:09:36] <Samex_Comex> Well there goes my plans this week
[2:09:39] <ahaegotrigger> but it wasnt meee
[2:09:44] <+JonWhoLovesFlatWomen> why
[2:09:45] <+SirGO0SE> @SatoruMasamune bun-chuks PogChamp
[2:09:50] <dadeaner> like that one Youtube series about raising baby ducks and in part 78 they talk about killing them for foodies
[2:09:58] <DillionPHCO> This is steering in a weird place
[2:09:59] <KaiserMario> Was that how Zootopia was made?
[2:10:02] <+pittpanther84> Rabbit is in the third game
[2:10:06] <C24U> I half expect him to toss it
[2:10:08] <+masked_hero_lucky> Your fire has longer range than you think
[2:10:11] <$pennykettle_> Sometimes I catch mosquitos and tear their legs off with nail clippers
[2:10:26] <theidealheight> nope
[2:10:37] <+cursedwithadhd> dont Judge Doom rabbits. got it
[2:10:50] <jellssssss20> Which end does it get slung by, do you grab its ears? Pls draw diagram
[2:11:04] <Daxalog> Spyro! A Bomb!
[2:11:05] <+EpicBigchill> Jumping and then using fire?
[2:11:06] <SatoruMasamune> He Is drunk. All dragons are alcoholics.
[2:11:12] <+Scevda> Back to molesting this bomb
[2:11:12] <+TIME_PUNCHER> haha dementia
[2:11:19] <SatoruMasamune> It's a serious problem.
[2:11:19] <theidealheight> you can absolutely flame them before they touch you
[2:11:23] <jellssssss20> They’re both from the smoke?
[2:11:26] <%Rezca> Old Pilot Bomb Dragon
[2:11:27] <jellssssss20> Born*
[2:11:29] <oshkeet41> I wonder is spyro controls so wonky cause he's fourlegged. dont got many quadraped platform characters
[2:11:30] <111111sagas111111> I know you can skin a rabbit that way
[2:11:32] <SilverRoddo> I’m somewhat interested in finding these dragons, and usually disappointed in them.
[2:11:36] <jellssssss20> SmokeBorne
[2:11:44] <dadeaner> "horned bitch"?
[2:11:44] <nademonkey1100> KEKW
[2:11:50] <C24U> Wait, that assumes Sypro dies first?
[2:11:51] <+JonWhoLovesFlatWomen> plague working at an old folks home
[2:11:55] <%JJCheeker> How does it feel spyro? To be a BITchhh
[2:11:57] <nademonkey1100> awww that emote doesnt work hre
[2:12:06] <111111sagas111111> you cut the skin around the wrists and ankles and then you whip it and the skin turns inside out
[2:12:07] <+masked_hero_lucky> I mean as far as the original trilogy is concerned, we never see a female dragon
[2:12:11] <+SinisterBroccoli> does this game have the like air hover move?
[2:12:16] <hypersongi> they only give you JUUUUUUST enough to glide for those..
[2:12:23] <theidealheight> i wish there were female dragons :((
[2:12:40] <%bettysharkface> Looks kinda like the double king
[2:12:41] <SatoruMasamune> Plague's life story: "I'm not gonna fuck this up!" "...I fucked it all up."
[2:13:27] <Triblade1992> no
[2:13:42] <+greensuperflash0> @theidealheight rule 63 Spyro
[2:13:55] <AnglerBridge22> atpSuspect TwitchLit atpBird
[2:14:00] <+masked_hero_lucky> You can make this glide
[2:14:07] <Shadope342> and is that not special
[2:14:36] <SatoruMasamune> "They just rocket into my asshole. Cool." -Plague of Gripes, July 2020.
[2:14:41] <hypersongi> and every time. they only JUUUUUST give you enough to glide
[2:14:42] <Aydarkzero> have we talked about how the ost is the Amanda Bynes ost?
[2:14:52] <laserbeaming> he's adorable
[2:14:53] <dadeaner> he looks great
[2:14:53] <+thegreenbenis> He's basically a cat.
[2:14:58] <Samex_Comex> Leave the baby alone
[2:14:58] <Triblade1992> Bettter than the Skylanders design Plague
[2:14:59] <King_Lethargy> NO BULLY
[2:15:01] <Zebroneath> Those legs are full of muscle, though
[2:15:05] <+OnwardEch0> :( dont bully spyrooo
[2:15:07] <LunarRemix> Aww man don't bully him
[2:15:14] <C24U> His tail tip looks like a long piece of coiled shit
[2:15:28] <+TIME_PUNCHER> Skylanders is Spyro
[2:15:32] <+masked_hero_lucky> Actually, in Japanese, the characters for Spyro look like Ripto in English
[2:15:35] <+thegreenbenis> Ripto's ripped asshole. @PlagueOfGripes
[2:15:36] <+TIME_PUNCHER> Skylanders: Swole
[2:15:37] <jellssssss20> The second trilogy
[2:15:42] <Shadope342> thats what I remember on the box cover anyways
[2:15:43] <+masked_hero_lucky> That's how Ripto got his name
[2:16:07] <KaiserMario> Rip To's asshole open
[2:16:09] <Aydarkzero> it's fun :)
[2:16:29] <+SinisterBroccoli> I'm exactly the same way
[2:16:30] <Triblade1992> Well the items have lore on it though
[2:16:38] <Dreigun> is it a trap? I thought that was the core premise of these games?
[2:16:39] <+Scevda> I kind of wish games would return to using gems/jewels as the collection items. I like shinies
[2:16:51] <+JonWhoLovesFlatWomen> whats that action
[2:16:52] <+thegreenbenis> Cacti do not make good prostate stimulatior .
[2:16:54] <+SinisterBroccoli> Scevda have you played Hat in Time?
[2:16:55] <ahaegotrigger> "burn the bunny"
[2:16:56] <Daxalog> Fine ill google it
[2:16:58] <Shadope342> if you're not a walking wiki by the end are you even playing it
[2:17:21] <C24U> It looks like a long coil of poop
[2:17:25] <%JJCheeker> It looks like soft serve ice cream
[2:17:26] <+TIME_PUNCHER> burning the bunny requires a zippo lighter and Barcadi 151
[2:17:27] <Shadope342> its a Bugle
[2:17:28] <+SinisterBroccoli> digimon poop
[2:17:29] <JonnyJug> Slowpoke
[2:17:29] <laserbeaming> it's like a rattlesnake?
[2:17:31] <Triblade1992> Poop on the stick
[2:17:32] <%JJCheeker> Or poop
[2:17:32] <+arancet> he has a rattler?
[2:17:38] <+Garden_Hills> looks like a she shell
[2:17:46] <theidealheight> looks like a rattle snake
[2:17:52] <Huntercd> dog knot
[2:17:52] <hypersongi> why would a dragon be a "rattler"?
[2:17:55] <C24U> It's unlike any other part of his anatomy
[2:18:03] <oshkeet41> dragons like being dramatic
[2:18:05] <%Too_Much_Nukie> It's a spiral. Because Spyro.
[2:18:21] <Aydarkzero> press Y for a slight height boost when gliding
[2:18:22] <+TIME_PUNCHER> the poopoo in Dragon Ball is called Goku psaSmug psaDab
[2:18:24] <+OnwardEch0> his prancing animation is so cue
[2:18:31] <%Rezca> Dragon dragon, get the dragon
[2:18:37] <Triblade1992> Press y for a slight height boost plague
[2:18:44] <hypersongi> its like they wanted Spyro to have a special cool spike-tail. but they were like "its a kids game" so they changed it to poop.
[2:18:46] <+thegreenbenis> Try Y at the end
[2:19:02] <+thegreenbenis> When jumping
[2:19:04] <jellssssss20> @plagueofgripes try to do the jump chat is telling you to do
[2:19:15] <theidealheight> hey plague is it okay to backseat? or nah
[2:19:16] <JonnyJug> The Y thing doesn't work in Spyro 1
[2:19:22] <+masked_hero_lucky> This game doesn't have the hover, Y will just make him drop
[2:19:24] <Monkey_D_Judd> If you press in on the joysticks Sparx should point in the direction of collectibles you're missing. Though it might only be in 2/3.
[2:19:29] <+JonWhoLovesFlatWomen> that's teh second game
[2:19:30] <Aydarkzero> glide then press Y to have a slight boost
[2:19:31] <%Too_Much_Nukie> The jump hover is not in the first game.
[2:19:31] <+thegreenbenis> Oh that's later games
[2:19:33] <LunarRemix> The button that makes you stop.
[2:19:39] <LunarRemix> Oh.
[2:19:39] <Tebrial> when you press Y while in flight, it stops you, but makes you go slightly higher
[2:19:41] <Shadope342> LUL
[2:19:46] <+pittpanther84> Y is for extend jump in Spyro 2 onward
[2:19:47] <+zooeymainbtw> thats a spyro 2 and 3 thing
[2:19:50] <theidealheight> LUL
[2:19:54] <CalderGaming> psa1guy
[2:20:04] <bazz_tv> so how the Dragon Dilf experiencie has been so far?
[2:20:08] <jellssssss20> It gives you a hover at the end to give you a height boost possibly but some are saying not in this game
[2:20:10] <+thegreenbenis> That's later games where they give you a slight boost.
[2:20:16] <laserbeaming> not in this game, that's introduced in 2
[2:20:17] <LunarRemix> I'm sorry, I got it confused. It's a thing in the later games.
[2:20:22] <jellssssss20> My bad
[2:20:22] <+masked_hero_lucky> In Spyro 2 and 3 Y will make Spyro flap and go a little higher, people are thinking that's in this one
[2:20:23] <ahaegotrigger> yeah hover is only for other games
[2:20:25] <+thegreenbenis> Yes, but no.
[2:20:26] <theidealheight> the Y button doesnt work on the first game
[2:20:33] <Tebrial> Yeah thats a staple in spyro 2 onward I think
[2:20:33] <ahaegotrigger> in this one Triangle button it to EAT SHIT
[2:20:35] <Aydarkzero> Kappa
[2:20:42] <nightslink> psaCrazy
[2:20:43] <+Scevda> When will one girl get some love...
[2:20:48] <nightslink> psa1guy
[2:21:01] <DonutRocket> haha, yes. This is that furry game.
[2:21:01] <%Too_Much_Nukie> You sure can
[2:21:10] <bazz_tv> dropping becomes useful in the flying levels and in some stages
[2:21:17] <SilverRoddo> Any%
[2:21:19] <CalderGaming> "not all 1 guys"
[2:21:32] <+masked_hero_lucky> It takes him long enough to swing that you can just rush him with fire
[2:21:34] <theidealheight> sorry if im backseating, but you cant reach that ledge from here
[2:21:48] <ahaegotrigger> try getting on top of the wall
[2:21:52] <Aydarkzero> liken a glide of some kind Kappa
[2:22:15] <jellssssss20> There’s a minimap that can be turned on in the menu??
[2:22:16] <Tebrial> That ledge you have to reach from around the canyon
[2:22:18] <JonnyJug> Get higher
[2:22:20] <jellssssss20> Weird
[2:22:31] <Tebrial> gotta fly around the canyon to that ledge
[2:22:31] <theidealheight> you gotta fly around the corner
[2:22:39] <Aydarkzero> check your left real quick
[2:22:42] <C24U> Can you somehow get on the ledges right next to you from somewhere?
[2:22:48] <jellssssss20> Sprint jump maybe
[2:22:51] <bazz_tv> If I recall there is higher platform from the other side
[2:23:02] <ahaegotrigger> oh yeah you have to a big reacharound on that one
[2:23:07] <+bagool3058> LEFT
[2:23:09] <+PhysicsLB> in the canyon, not from the tower
[2:23:11] <DonutRocket> It's been so long since I played this game
[2:23:16] <jellssssss20> It’s in options
[2:23:21] <laserbeaming> there's a higher platform around the cliff
[2:23:23] <+thegreenbenis> Charge glide might help.
[2:23:29] <theidealheight> the ledge you have to jump from is on the same wall as the ledge you wanna reach
[2:23:31] <+thegreenbenis> Nope
[2:23:32] <ShinChris> !time
[2:23:33] <Tebrial> Secret higher area yeag
[2:23:34] <+FackinCrazy> I think there's a mini map in the options unless it's only the 3 Rd game
[2:23:35] <DonutRocket> I miss it but I have to move on
[2:23:37] <+PhysicsLB> behind you
[2:23:37] <bazz_tv> you have to glide U turn from the other side
[2:23:40] <+bagool3058> look to the left of the ledge and up
[2:23:48] <ShinChris> thank you
[2:23:53] <ahaegotrigger> yeah its like 2 and half hours
[2:23:53] <+Scevda> wait what?
[2:23:54] <bazz_tv> also there is a minimap in this
[2:23:55] <+thegreenbenis> Oh I never noticed that
[2:23:57] <+Scevda> commands?
[2:24:01] <ShinChris> that's handy
[2:24:03] <afronooch> not there on mobile
[2:24:04] <ahaegotrigger> yes
[2:24:05] <whittacre> not in theatre mode, but yeah it's there
[2:24:05] <bazz_tv> is in the options
[2:24:07] <theidealheight> yeah!!!
[2:24:12] <Daxalog> Uptime is unreliable depending on your computers time system settings.
[2:24:18] <+bagool3058> we did it boys
[2:24:25] <+Scevda> well I'll be
[2:24:26] <ahaegotrigger> youve been there before
[2:25:07] <theidealheight> YEAAAAAHH BOYYY
[2:25:12] <ahaegotrigger> Nice
[2:25:17] <BlkFlameKami> BIG CHUNGUS
[2:25:18] <%Rezca> Maximus Prime
[2:25:21] <Aydarkzero> CHONK
[2:25:23] <JonnyJug> You don't look like an Eli
[2:25:27] <+CozyCoat> CHONK
[2:25:28] <Shwepie> Not huge enough.
[2:25:35] <%JJCheeker> He's got a George Lucas nek
[2:25:39] <bazz_tv> boy I can't wait for Plague to discover the joys of learning tree tops layout later
[2:25:43] <Aydarkzero> don't worry about it Kappa
[2:25:43] <ahaegotrigger> nah hes the CHONK
[2:25:51] <Tebrial> oh he's maximus. Maximum fat
[2:25:51] <nademonkey1100> also generic voice
[2:25:57] <not_crabby> LOL
[2:25:59] <Grandma_Amari> You're not blind enough or black enough to be an Eli, Plague.
[2:25:59] <ahaegotrigger> what would an Eli look like?
[2:25:59] <+Scevda> Eh, you look pretty Eli to me
[2:26:01] <AnglerBridge22> atpCap
[2:26:01] <Nomenanza> clearly, maximus was in relation to his dragon penis
[2:26:10] <Aydarkzero> oh i remember the designs are more based on worlds than names
[2:26:11] <jellssssss20> What are the options anyways?
[2:26:15] <+jorgamund> so you designed your fictional self to look like an Eli? SeemsGood
[2:26:32] <ahaegotrigger> purple death liquid seems a bit harsh
[2:26:49] <oshkeet41> probably one of those 'revisit with some new technique deal' like a lot of platformers
[2:26:51] <bazz_tv> the designs are based on jobs, and jobs are based in the worlds name
[2:26:54] <Aydarkzero> this area technically counts as blight town given the water is purple
[2:26:58] <GarbageNirvana> What if you meet a dragon named daddy
[2:27:09] <Nomenanza> I never played Spyro 1, but back in Spyro 2 on PS1 they had entire sections where you just run
[2:27:09] <bazz_tv> hence Artisans and Peace Keepers
[2:27:11] <SuperVaderMan> Oh no
[2:27:22] <@Nightbot> Plague is a youtube animator and also streams at https://picarto.tv/Plague . Also: t-shirts! http://goo.gl/lze8QO
[2:27:28] <Grandma_Amari> The mario kart on gamecube was pretty good
[2:27:32] <Grandma_Amari> Whichever one that was
[2:27:33] <+FackinCrazy> just booted up the game and there's totally a mini map if you enable it in the options
[2:27:33] <Solidnick18> wooliePOYO
[2:27:39] <Aydarkzero> wait why wouldn't you just play 8 right away?
[2:27:42] <Aydarkzero> oh
[2:27:44] <bazz_tv> I feel Paige would like this game
[2:27:50] <theidealheight> huh? why not?
[2:27:53] <C24U> Shadow Banned?
[2:28:00] <+arancet> dont have the sub?\
[2:28:02] <%JJCheeker> Nintendo online sucks
[2:28:05] <+jorgamund> did you try jiggling the handle?
[2:28:06] <+JonWhoLovesFlatWomen> did you pay the 20 dolars for the sub?
[2:28:09] <Artista_AF> did you paid for the online service?
[2:28:17] <alextrebeken> ctr?
[2:28:18] <Grandma_Amari> lul
[2:28:22] <laserbeaming> Crash Team Racing?
[2:28:26] <%Rezca> Sonic Team Racing?
[2:28:26] <whittacre> super tux racing!
[2:28:26] <Aydarkzero> Garfield Kart is the devils game stay away from that
[2:28:27] <+jorgamund> Final Fantasy Racing
[2:28:30] <+Scevda> Garfield cart is the EVO of cart racing
[2:28:36] <GarbageNirvana> SRB2 Kart is RIGHT THERE
[2:28:40] <jellssssss20> Inb4 didn’t pay for Nintendo online Kappa
[2:28:42] <theidealheight> crash team racing os hard as hell
[2:28:48] <+masked_hero_lucky> CTR best kart racer
[2:28:49] <Samex_Comex> Can you play Double dash online on the Dolphin emulator now?
[2:28:50] <+jorgamund> Chocobo Racing
[2:28:53] <bazz_tv> CTR is arguably better than Mario Kart
[2:28:54] <C24U> Ditty Kong Racing is the Shit
[2:28:54] <DillionPHCO> The Garfield Kart is jacked up
[2:29:01] <Grandma_Amari> @Scevda In that it has a ton of sexual deviants? ZING.
[2:29:04] <%JJCheeker> I love diddy Kong racing
[2:29:06] <Solidnick18> diddy kong racing FeelsGoodMan
[2:29:10] <+Scevda> zing
[2:29:10] <Aydarkzero> crash team racing has a huge learning curve to get good at
[2:29:42] <bazz_tv> both Diddy Kong Racing and Crash Team Racing are better than Mario Kart imo
[2:29:47] <Aydarkzero> ^
[2:29:48] <+TheNewZealandStory> sega all-stars racing transformed is a good racer
[2:29:52] <+Kenzo2000> sonic and sega all stars is pretty good
[2:30:16] <JonnyJug> Wish Diddy Kong or CTR was on PC
[2:30:22] <Grandma_Amari> This remake thing looks really good.
[2:30:40] <laserbeaming> Crash Team Racing on PS4
[2:30:42] <Aydarkzero> i'm surprised ctr didn't make it to pc
[2:30:45] <twistedj3ster> I tried to play this on the switch and it looked like the GPU was dying
[2:30:53] <+Scevda> does anyone know whether the SW EP1 Racer has multiplayer in its re-release
[2:30:56] <+echobee_tv> Double Dash on Dolphin maybe?
[2:30:57] <+masked_hero_lucky> I can't believe CTR NF still isn't on PC
[2:30:58] <Aydarkzero> guess they didn't want to go the same route mhw did
[2:31:02] <theidealheight> SRB2 Kar is pretty good
[2:31:06] <bazz_tv> isn't Crash on steam?
[2:31:09] <Grandma_Amari> Is plague playing this on PC?
[2:31:10] <theidealheight> kart*
[2:31:20] <Aydarkzero> the N.Sane trilogy is on Steam but not Nitro Fueled
[2:31:32] <Coystick> Heeeey you're still going, still mad about the lack of lore
[2:31:34] <Coystick> ?
[2:31:41] <Schlongalong> can u not land ontop of the tower?
[2:31:51] <jellssssss20> Can you jump on that wooden post
[2:31:56] <Aydarkzero> Plague needs to use the gem finder
[2:32:20] <Coystick> Does he know about clicking in the thumbsticks to make Sparx point?
[2:32:21] <bazz_tv> you can turn on the minimap
[2:32:41] <GarbageNirvana> Still a '90s platformer
[2:32:56] <+FackinCrazy> Turn on the mini map in the options
[2:33:01] <Schlongalong> we did it
[2:33:06] <Aydarkzero> the worlds later get pretty confusing i remember in the 4th world i forgot how to 100% a level b/c it's been so long since i played them LUL
[2:33:09] <+Scevda> Right down the road
[2:33:32] <rajathene> Did you get the online pass for your Nintendo account on your switch? You can't play online without it.
[2:33:37] <tolloponik> sonic Kart Robo blast 2 maybe? @PlagueOfGripes
[2:33:43] <Coystick> I'm not sure if it's in Reignited but in OG Spyro you could sequence break almost every level by flying in the right spot
[2:33:57] <ShinChris> well at least visually this looks great
[2:33:58] <bazz_tv> just like Banjo uses Kazooie
[2:34:05] <%Rezca> Glass It
[2:34:12] <+Scevda> Spyro of the first flame
[2:34:12] <Nomenanza> Spyro: Trogdorr Edition
[2:34:36] <+buck_nastiest> Spyro: Into the Vore
[2:34:40] <+SWindleFeD> Sonic racing?
[2:34:43] <Nomenanza> it always felt weird having Sonic characters DRIVE
[2:34:47] <+Kenzo2000> the new sonic one isn't great, Transformed was good
[2:34:48] <ahaegotrigger> why would sonic Drive???
[2:34:49] <+TheNewZealandStory> transformed is good, team sonic racing is mediocre
[2:34:49] <+jiggy_snipe> Transformed is good
[2:34:50] <SunsetJack> Wait, the team one?
[2:34:53] <+FackinCrazy> Sonic racing transformed is the good one
[2:34:56] <+JonWhoLovesFlatWomen> i thought paige loved sanic
[2:34:57] <tolloponik> I ment the fan game
[2:35:00] <bazz_tv> the flame hitbox is in front of You not abobe you
[2:35:00] <+jiggy_snipe> the most recent is mediocre from what I heard
[2:35:04] <ahaegotrigger> at least it has Rouge
[2:35:12] <+whiskywolfe> Everybody's HAD Rogue
[2:35:15] <ahaegotrigger> "ruin" Kreygasm
[2:35:16] <Samex_Comex> Transformed is the good one
[2:35:20] <+thegreenbenis> You could give command fairy big ole tiddies
[2:35:23] <theidealheight> ruin WutFace
[2:35:25] <+thegreenbenis> commando
[2:35:28] <+TheNewZealandStory> danica patrick is in transformed
[2:35:35] <+SWindleFeD> Just employ rule 63 and ruin the genderbent male characters
[2:36:03] <bazz_tv> oh boy are you playing this for Elora and Bianca aren't you Plague?
[2:36:12] <Coystick> It's a nostalgia game, if you bought it without any nostalgia you might have made mistake
[2:36:14] <Schlongalong> i guess you can play danica patrick int he new sonic racing game
[2:36:28] <theidealheight> HUH?
[2:36:28] <Coystick> Annnd isolated
[2:36:30] <+TheNewZealandStory> not the new one
[2:36:36] <ahaegotrigger> they even present their nude asses to you Plague
[2:36:39] <tolloponik> robo blast 2 is a fan game that works like Mario K 64 you can add custom sprites
[2:36:40] <+TheNewZealandStory> danica patrick is EXCLUSIVE to transformed
[2:36:55] <ahaegotrigger> yes
[2:37:02] <+PhysicsLB> you should make it
[2:37:02] <+FackinCrazy> You can
[2:37:06] <Triblade1992> you can
[2:37:06] <Nomenanza> is there a flutter in this game? I think you can with it
[2:37:06] <Coystick> Coward
[2:37:07] <+thegreenbenis> You can.
[2:37:11] <ahaegotrigger> just do it
[2:37:18] <Coystick> "but baa baa"
[2:37:19] <+TheNewZealandStory> just take the leap
[2:37:21] <+pittpanther84> yolo
[2:37:24] <+FackinCrazy> YES
[2:37:27] <+thegreenbenis> YOLO
[2:37:31] <+jiggy_snipe> LUL
[2:37:31] <+SWindleFeD> "Dragon commits genocide on militaristic desert dwelling nation - circa 2020"
[2:37:35] <ahaegotrigger> YES
[2:37:56] <+PhysicsLB> i hate flying levels
[2:38:00] <Coystick> Yooo Overlord was the shit, but also shit
[2:38:05] <SilverRoddo> Undetected night flight.
[2:38:08] <Solidnick18> yeah they do
[2:38:15] <Solidnick18> i feel that
[2:38:15] <+FackinCrazy> I liked the first overlord
[2:38:19] <Coystick> That is bang on, junk food video game
[2:38:22] <+SWindleFeD> I loved Overlord: raising hell
[2:38:22] <+Scevda> Flying level time
[2:38:24] <+PhysicsLB> kinda like animal crossing...played religiously for a week then just....stopped
[2:38:26] <ahaegotrigger> LUL
[2:38:28] <ahaegotrigger> YEs
[2:38:28] <laserbeaming> these levels are not great
[2:38:28] <+Taglog7> WutFace WutFace WutFace
[2:38:31] <+xeros720> yes
[2:38:32] <bazz_tv> flying levels are not as bad as they seem
[2:38:33] <+TheNewZealandStory> you have already failed
[2:38:35] <+masked_hero_lucky> Welcome to a flight level
[2:38:38] <twistedj3ster> yeah, these suck
[2:38:38] <Coystick> DO NOT SPEEDWAY God
[2:38:38] <+jiggy_snipe> LUL
[2:38:39] <+OMightyZeus> These are pretty lame. Enjoy.
[2:38:46] <whittacre> once you touch the ground you've lost flight
[2:38:47] <theidealheight> he gets pissed
[2:38:55] <+SWindleFeD> There's a reason these kinds of levels didn't stick around for long
[2:39:01] <bazz_tv> you just need to know the proper route
[2:39:01] <SilverRoddo> Batman gliding?
[2:39:05] <+Taglog7> Cuz I'm Freeeee
[2:39:07] <+xeros720> nah, you can properly fly
[2:39:07] <Coystick> Awful awful levels
[2:39:09] <ahaegotrigger> you have to collect all the items
[2:39:10] <%Rezca> Where is the Nights In to Dreams song?
[2:39:11] <theidealheight> man this level is so difficult
[2:39:14] <+FackinCrazy> You have to get everyhting before the timer runs out
[2:39:15] <+xeros720> superman 64 was the right comparison
[2:39:32] <+SWindleFeD> There's an order you can do these in so that you have time to spare when you finish
[2:39:36] <terminusterminal> That's one hell of a sidebar
[2:39:47] <+TheNewZealandStory> the flight stages are the real reward for putting up with the rest of the game
[2:39:51] <KitsuneManami> So Plague, do you like some of the Redesigns? some people complained about them
[2:39:55] <Coystick> Good man, it is
[2:39:56] <+thegreenbenis> Those ones suck hairy nuts
[2:39:56] <ahaegotrigger> it is
[2:39:56] <JonnyJug> They are
[2:39:58] <whittacre> speedways suck
[2:39:58] <Solidnick18> yeah if you want
[2:40:01] <Shadope342> yep
[2:40:11] <+masked_hero_lucky> To 100% the flight levels you need to get all of them in one run, it can be pretty tough
[2:40:12] <bazz_tv> they are obstacle courses the objective is to get them all in such a way they give you the time
[2:40:20] <KitsuneManami> Oh uh.. then... you think the Fawn girl is cute? :P
[2:40:29] <+thegreenbenis> The redesigns are weird.
[2:40:34] <Coystick> I 'm so impressed by how hard they nailed the game visually
[2:40:44] <KitsuneManami> Yup
[2:40:45] <Aydarkzero> i enjoy the remaster designs
[2:40:47] <+bagool3058> You should play the second or third game if you want the REAL furry bait.
[2:40:48] <ahaegotrigger> yes
[2:40:54] <KitsuneManami> DUDE! he looks sick
[2:40:54] <Coystick> Snake?
[2:40:54] <+FackinCrazy> Yeah
[2:40:56] <ahaegotrigger> I like this one
[2:40:57] <+TheNewZealandStory> wow this dragon is hot
[2:40:59] <Nomenanza> Man, Gunnar doesn't look like a gun
[2:40:59] <bazz_tv> all adult dragons from Spyro 1 used to look the same in the ps1
[2:41:00] <KitsuneManami> Its DEATHWING!
[2:41:03] <+jiggy_snipe> eyepatch dragon
[2:41:15] <C24U> Wheres Trogdor?
[2:41:16] <+Taglog7> Sally Acorn Effect
[2:41:23] <ahaegotrigger> try gliding across
[2:41:25] <theidealheight> its just for style
[2:41:25] <GarbageNirvana> It's MLP rules
[2:41:28] <Aydarkzero> monkaS
[2:41:33] <Coystick> At least there's no face meat in this game
[2:41:36] <KitsuneManami> lol yea
[2:41:42] <Samex_Comex> Or like Mrs brisby
[2:41:43] <+Kenzo2000> when did she get spats?
[2:41:48] <bazz_tv> are you using the analogue stick? i feel the Dpad works better for this game
[2:41:52] <Coystick> If Rogue took off her face meat?
[2:41:55] <KitsuneManami> Baaaaasicly? and Amy
[2:41:56] <+FackinCrazy> But with tits
[2:41:58] <+Scevda> Nah, tiddies flopping all over the place
[2:41:59] <+Taglog7> Gadget
[2:42:01] <GarbageNirvana> But with huge tits
[2:42:05] <+TheNewZealandStory> rogue's tits are hairless and more defined
[2:42:07] <+buck_nastiest> fur colored skin
[2:42:11] <Tebrial> huge BAT tiddie
[2:42:21] <KitsuneManami> "Oh No my big shitty trick FAILED"
[2:42:22] <+OnwardEch0> ah, as usual rouge causes men to just lose it
[2:42:24] <theidealheight> bitch
[2:42:27] <+masked_hero_lucky> You also could have just glided across the water tof lame him
[2:42:32] <+masked_hero_lucky> That thief is real easy
[2:42:38] <KitsuneManami> i HATE THAT SHIT!
[2:42:39] <+Taglog7> Try and Catch me BITCH
[2:42:46] <%Rezca> gotta clench hard
[2:42:46] <KitsuneManami> My exact reaction when that happens XD
[2:42:56] <KitsuneManami> happened a bit in todays time on Ghost
[2:43:15] <+SWindleFeD> So how is everybody?
[2:43:19] <+thegreenbenis> The sequels get much more better and interesting.
[2:43:23] <+SWindleFeD> ^
[2:43:23] <SilverRoddo> Glide cancel into butt stomp
[2:43:25] <+thegreenbenis> Doing good.
[2:43:34] <+SWindleFeD> Year of the dragon was great back in the day
[2:43:38] <ahaegotrigger> get fucked kid :)
[2:43:44] <ahaegotrigger> yes
[2:43:49] <+thegreenbenis> First one is a little rough after over 20 years.
[2:43:56] <Coystick> You sound like you wanted to die?
[2:44:06] <ahaegotrigger> got it
[2:44:07] <tolloponik> I didn't mean official, robo blast 2 is a fan game that works like Mario K 64 you can add custom sprites
[2:44:10] <Coystick> ONE GUY
[2:44:11] <+Scevda> One guy!
[2:44:12] <+Taglog7> woolieONEGUY
[2:44:21] <+thegreenbenis> One guy
[2:44:25] <+FackinCrazy> Oh shit that man is ready for covid
[2:44:28] <+PhysicsLB> Doctor Shemp?
[2:44:29] <+thegreenbenis> You beat his ass first
[2:44:30] <ahaegotrigger> you beat him first
[2:44:31] <+masked_hero_lucky> It was Dr. Shemp
[2:44:33] <laserbeaming> Doctor Shemp
[2:44:35] <Triblade1992> Doctor Shemp
[2:44:35] <+thegreenbenis> Doctor Shemp
[2:44:36] <Mister_McDerp> dr. shemp
[2:44:36] <ahaegotrigger> he was a BITCH
[2:44:40] <moonsaber99> the guy with the butt
[2:44:40] <ahaegotrigger> Dr SIMP
[2:44:42] <%Too_Much_Nukie> Shemp
[2:44:44] <%Maloane> Maloane subscribed with Twitch Prime. 
[2:44:54] <+thegreenbenis> The boss was Doctor Dummy thicc
[2:44:56] <laserbeaming> probably
[2:44:56] <%Rezca> Bad Dragon says yes
[2:44:58] <Srthunda> somewhere
[2:44:58] <Solidnick18> probably
[2:44:59] <ahaegotrigger> yeah probably
[2:44:59] <oshkeet41> cloacas
[2:45:01] <Triblade1992> bad dragon says yes
[2:45:01] <Samex_Comex> This games bosses are barley bosses
[2:45:01] <whittacre> cloaca
[2:45:01] <+PhysicsLB> they lay egss so...
[2:45:02] <SilverRoddo> Speaking of which, would one rather get Commando Stomped?
[2:45:02] <+thegreenbenis> Bad Dragon
[2:45:02] <+FusRoDom> Bad Dragons do
[2:45:03] <SuperVaderMan> In certain animations Dragons have dicks
[2:45:03] <Coystick> They have Subway Sandwiches
[2:45:03] <+Scevda> Eli, you know the answer to that
[2:45:05] <LunarRemix> Corkscrew dicks.
[2:45:05] <+Draylle> no, thats why they have dragon dildos
[2:45:05] <+Taglog7> never got those Dragon Dildos
[2:45:05] <+Kenzo2000> How else would they fuck cars?
[2:45:05] <theidealheight> baby you know it
[2:45:10] <bazz_tv> bosses are jokes in this game, they don't become a real thing until 2
[2:45:10] <oshkeet41> dicks aint aerodynamic
[2:45:11] <C24U> Some lizards can change sec's right?
[2:45:13] <Nomenanza> everything can have a dick if the artist is brave enough
[2:45:14] <Huntercd> Ask dropoutdragon
[2:45:15] <ahaegotrigger> maybe Spyro is just a sprayer
[2:45:18] <Samex_Comex> Often?
[2:45:18] <KitsuneManami> and HUUUUUGE
[2:45:20] <ahaegotrigger> and has a Cloaca
[2:45:20] <+thegreenbenis> They have dildos so they must
[2:45:21] <alextrebeken> but how many?
[2:45:22] <Firemane1279> damn straight dragons have dicks. SeemsGood
[2:45:24] <King_Lethargy> Is that a rhetorical question?
[2:45:25] <C24U> Often Horse like
[2:45:25] <SilverRoddo> I think Dragon’s have inner Ds.
[2:45:34] <whittacre> I like this hub
[2:45:34] <tolloponik> I know ducks do
[2:45:35] <Triblade1992> It's a muppet
[2:45:37] <ahaegotrigger> yes
[2:45:44] <Coystick> That is NOT a nose
[2:45:49] <+FackinCrazy> Imagine if dragons had like super human like dicks
[2:45:56] <KitsuneManami> @PlagueOfGripes what you think of the Crash 4 designs
[2:46:00] <Aydarkzero> ah the magic world
[2:46:04] <oshkeet41> he really does move like a sheep would, hard to turn
[2:46:12] <+SWindleFeD> The charging was shit then and it's shit now
[2:46:15] <+thegreenbenis> @FackinCrazy Super human dicks or Human like dicks?
[2:46:20] <Coystick> You're like halfway through the game already
[2:46:24] <+Taglog7> Short hair Coco Kreygasm
[2:46:30] <Aydarkzero> i just got use to the charge
[2:46:30] <+FackinCrazy> @thegreenbenis yes
[2:46:35] <C24U> Why dont YOU help?
[2:46:35] <ahaegotrigger> I feel like youll love and Hate this world
[2:46:43] <+Scevda> I mean, Im really done already
[2:46:45] <%Maloane> Maloane is gifting 2 Tier 1 Subs to PlagueOfGripes's community! They've gifted a total of 2 in the channel! 
[2:46:46] <%Maloane> Maloane gifted a Tier 1 sub to Necrodancer! 
[2:46:47] <%Maloane> Maloane gifted a Tier 1 sub to WAMMUWAMMU! 
[2:46:48] <+thegreenbenis> @FackinCrazy Correct answer
[2:47:05] <Aydarkzero> the new one
[2:47:05] <KitsuneManami> About Time
[2:47:05] <usotaku013666> It is a kids game
[2:47:13] <+Scevda> Malo mart?

[2:47:37] <+SWindleFeD> Crash 4: Its dic time
[2:47:38] <%Maloane> @swindlefed Pre
[2:47:40] <Aydarkzero> they gave Coco a neck LUL
[2:47:50] <whittacre> yeah, she has problems
[2:47:56] <whittacre> ctr coco was pretty perfect
[2:47:57] <LunarRemix> I like her original design.
[2:48:02] <LunarRemix> From 2-3
[2:48:05] <Coystick> She's a big triangle pointing up to compliment Crash being a triangle pointing down
[2:48:07] <KitsuneManami> yea overalls
[2:48:17] <SirFancySwank> i like the new one
[2:48:18] <KitsuneManami> just dont look up Skylanders
[2:48:28] <KitsuneManami> OH! there has been leak snidbits of Tawna
[2:48:39] <KitsuneManami> Tawna is back in 4
[2:48:40] <whittacre> the crash team racing remake has the coveralls again
[2:48:51] <twistedj3ster> It's Activision, they ruin everything
[2:48:56] <GarbageNirvana> Remember edgy Elijah Woods Spyro
[2:48:58] <Aydarkzero> i dunno i think the designs are good
[2:49:02] <Samex_Comex> Yeah her head looks off
[2:49:08] <+Scevda> Because penis need it to be a different shape
[2:49:11] <Samex_Comex> It might be the googles?
[2:49:12] <Coystick> Goddamn animes
[2:49:18] <+bagool3058> Bandicute
[2:49:27] <King_Lethargy> There's just something off about the new designs. They make me uncomfortablr.
[2:49:31] <C24U> Like Spider Moles?
[2:49:35] <nademonkey1100> then crash is just a torso
[2:49:46] <KitsuneManami> @PlagueOfGripes google Crash 4 Tawna later she's a pirate with a green mowhawk now. idk what to think till we see actual footage
[2:50:00] <twistedj3ster> You don't think Dik-Diks are cute?
[2:50:10] <Coystick> Bandicoots are crackhead dingos, and dingos are crackhead dogs already
[2:50:12] <Nomenanza> "fuck it" quite literally
[2:50:12] <Aydarkzero> @KitsuneManami that might be an alternate timeline Tawna
[2:50:15] <bazz_tv> hey this is the level with the Amanda show theme song isn't?
[2:50:18] <KitsuneManami> yea
[2:50:32] <Coystick> So bandicoots are third layer crackheads
[2:50:38] <Nomenanza> iirc Coco's head in Crash 3 was almost the size of her upper torso
[2:50:39] <+Scevda> I wish I liked lamb, but its smell throws me off SOOOO hard.
[2:50:39] <+Taglog7> BITCH
[2:50:44] <+SWindleFeD> @KitsuneManami An interesting design to say the least
[2:50:46] <Aydarkzero> this whole game is Amanda Bynes soundtrack
[2:50:55] <ahaegotrigger> yeah Tawnya Bandicoot
[2:51:01] <+SWindleFeD> Nope, it's Tawna
[2:51:04] <Oneyeseesin3D> sup chat
[2:51:05] <+Scevda> Bimbo
[2:51:08] <KingKrampus> am i the only one always thrown for a loop when they see Plague and he DOESN'T have a ZZ TOP beard?
[2:51:12] <Samex_Comex> The Candy Kong looking one
[2:51:15] <KitsuneManami> Did you see the remaster ver?
[2:51:20] <Nomenanza> ah yes, Crash's gf that only appeared in Crash 1
[2:51:20] <bazz_tv> oh wait it was wizard peak that had the Amanda show
[2:51:25] <stardoggames33> Its dragon thime
[2:51:28] <Explodincatz> its Velam VS Daphne part 2
[2:51:33] <Coystick> Hey I got an idea give Conker franchise to Toys for Bob
[2:51:36] <Aydarkzero> here it comes LUL
[2:51:39] <KitsuneManami> LOL
[2:51:40] <%Rezca> Shine Spark?
[2:51:43] <ahaegotrigger> TRUE
[2:51:45] <+FackinCrazy> So when you kill critters in this game where does the butterfly come from like do the reincarnate into them only to be eaten seconds later
[2:51:49] <+Taglog7> I prefer Minerva
[2:51:51] <KitsuneManami> Spyro: WOW FUN!"
[2:51:53] <+Scevda> "Satan I feel amazing"
[2:52:15] <thesanderdc> You're gonna have to learn how to charge now
[2:52:31] <KingKrampus> like I'm genuinely disappointed plague doesn't have a magnificent hillbilly santa beard
[2:52:34] <Oneyeseesin3D> If you kill wizards you can take their money.
[2:52:39] <+SWindleFeD> Don't you keep your money inside your body?
[2:52:41] <theidealheight> "lets kill him and get it"
[2:52:47] <+Scevda> Not yet @KingKrampus
[2:52:54] <bazz_tv> I hope you like this mechanic because there is an entire level designed for it later
[2:53:06] <Oneyeseesin3D> @SWindleFeD I only keep alcohol in my body >.>
[2:53:14] <+thegreenbenis> OKAY BOOMER
[2:53:22] <+FackinCrazy> Yo is that a bong cane
[2:53:25] <Coystick> Spongero
[2:53:27] <+TIME_PUNCHER> why is Plague
[2:53:31] <oshkeet41> 90s mascot syndrome
[2:53:35] <Nomenanza> ( and spyro hasn't learnt to fly even in 2 )
[2:53:36] <ahaegotrigger> hes Purple Naruto
[2:53:42] <%bettysharkface> Plague, we made something for you.
[2:53:49] <bazz_tv> according to the game lore that man was money before Nasty Gnork turn him into a man
[2:53:49] <+SWindleFeD> It was the 90s tude that was "cool" back then
[2:53:59] <Samex_Comex> Uh oh
[2:54:02] <ahaegotrigger> no itll still suck
[2:54:02] <THELava_lad> that must be the reason humans have been fighting for generations theres money inside all off us
[2:54:03] <Coystick> One day I will play FF9
[2:54:16] <%bettysharkface> It's transparent.
[2:54:17] <bazz_tv> just be thankful you are not hearing his original voice
[2:54:28] <Oneyeseesin3D> time to fly through rings. like superman.
[2:54:32] <%bettysharkface> I also tagged you with it on Twitter.
[2:54:40] <@DCN2049> hehehe
[2:54:51] <Coystick> I'd love to see the stats on who completed these levels, I bet it's 00.1%
[2:54:53] <C24U> Superman 64
[2:54:56] <whittacre> can't wait to watch plague learn to skateboard in 2
[2:54:59] <bazz_tv> Originally Spyro was voiced by the guy who voiced Ricochet on Mucha Lucha
[2:55:10] <+masked_hero_lucky> Well usually it points you directly at the optimal path
[2:55:11] <+Scevda> Eli can't into Ace Combat
[2:55:12] <Oneyeseesin3D> splash
[2:55:17] <bazz_tv> before he became Spongebob
[2:55:21] <Nomenanza> these always were ass, especially if you going for 100%
[2:55:22] <ahaegotrigger> yes
[2:55:25] <%Rezca> Gotta read between his lines
[2:55:26] <+SWindleFeD> Pretty much
[2:55:26] <+thegreenbenis> @whittacre That was three I think.
[2:55:27] <+FackinCrazy> @Coystick its got a high platinum trophy percent
[2:55:38] <laserbeaming> those are not great levels
[2:55:55] <whittacre> @thegreenbenis pretty sure it was in 2 as well
[2:56:11] <whittacre> could be wrong
[2:56:15] <C24U> Very Wicked Witch death animation
[2:56:18] <+SWindleFeD> The worst part is that you have to 100% all the levels if you want to fight Gnasty Gnorc
[2:56:20] <Nomenanza> that is cute how you turnt that wizard's flesh to ash
[2:56:20] <bazz_tv> the flying races in 3 are worse imo
[2:56:23] <+FackinCrazy> 9.5% have 100%ed this game
[2:56:24] <Coystick> @FackinCrazy I lose faith in humanity
[2:56:33] <+thegreenbenis> I never played 2. @whittacre
[2:56:38] <+masked_hero_lucky> No lock on that chest
[2:56:44] <whittacre> 2's my favourite
[2:56:44] <Nomenanza> supercharge iirc
[2:56:47] <+masked_hero_lucky> Remember the super charge ramp?
[2:56:47] <%Rezca> Only Wizards can turn
[2:56:49] <ahaegotrigger> supercharge
[2:56:52] <bazz_tv> that's a supercharge chest
[2:56:52] <SirFancySwank> gotta supercharge it
[2:56:58] <+SWindleFeD> @PlagueOfGripes you have to use supercharge for that chest
[2:56:59] <Coystick> BigBrainofGripes
[2:57:01] <Oneyeseesin3D> chest only like dumb dumb
[2:57:27] <theidealheight> oh this chest. it took me forever to figure it out
[2:57:30] <Nomenanza> shout out to that level called BLOWHARD
[2:57:38] <ShinChris> i'm surprised paige isn't watching
[2:57:39] <laserbeaming> someone link Plague the Fat Spyro mod
[2:57:49] <C24U> Wait that was BS. He shot his magic through the portal but it went past it instead of going in it
[2:58:07] <Coystick> Amazing Chest Ahead
[2:58:24] <SirFancySwank> its possible but annoying to do
[2:58:26] <Coystick> This took me a few attempts
[2:58:26] <Nomenanza> supercharge lasts until you stop iirc
[2:58:32] <bazz_tv> truely this is the dark souls of baby games
[2:58:38] <+SWindleFeD> @Nomenanza or until you're stopped
[2:58:38] <ahaegotrigger> just jump in mid air
[2:58:44] <ahaegotrigger> its like a cheat code
[2:58:49] <Baselines> Ive never seen plauges face until now, even after 100+ hours of DS1 commentary. He looks exactly as i imagined
[2:58:59] <Pouch_cotato> poor plague and his boomer hands
[2:59:04] <theidealheight> its not that hard, you can do ot
[2:59:05] <laserbeaming> fuck it, I'll just twit it to you or something
[2:59:10] <+thegreenbenis> Plague looks exactly like you expect him too
[2:59:15] <+Scevda> 8 year olds are too busy calling your mom a bad names on Fortnite and Moder Warfare
[2:59:18] <+thegreenbenis> So does pat
[2:59:19] <+FackinCrazy> The best part of the uncharted games is that you can play as fat Nathan drake
[2:59:20] <KingKrampus> Wonder if there's a mod to put Cinder from the Legend of Spyro trilogy in this game
[2:59:23] <bazz_tv> you can turn in the air
[2:59:31] <ahaegotrigger> LUL

[3:13:25] <LunarRemix> Why doesn't Dragon Ball gets weird?
[3:13:29] <+jiggy_snipe> and thus furries were created
[3:13:32] <SuperVaderMan> And Sonic attracts more weirdos than usual, for some reason
[3:13:37] <theidealheight> i really wish there was a documentary on weird sonic bullshit
[3:13:38] <twistedj3ster> oh dbz gets weird
[3:13:44] <+SWindleFeD> Do you guys think that Sonic could kill people by rocketing out his jizz?

[3:26:21] <bazz_tv> dream makers has some intense enemies too
[3:26:28] <+SWindleFeD> Do the LB and RB buttons do side rolls in this game, it's been a while so I forget
[3:26:36] <CursedNobleman> yes
[3:26:42] <CursedNobleman> also, do not fuck with these frogs
[3:26:49] <Coystick> They look amazing, but they're basic
[3:26:51] <CyberDingus> those little fuckers gave kid me fits of rage.
[3:26:55] <ahaegotrigger> there will be some good ones
[3:26:57] <KaiserMario> Seems wasteful huh?
[3:27:02] <Coystick> The vultures
[3:27:04] <ahaegotrigger> but theyre later level generally
[3:27:05] <theidealheight> its still a ps1 game at heart, man
[3:27:12] <bazz_tv> sounds like a kids game, who would a thunk it
[3:27:18] <thesanderdc> You charge those
[3:27:19] <@Nightbot> Plague is a youtube animator and also streams at https://picarto.tv/Plague . Also: t-shirts! http://goo.gl/lze8QO

[3:27:47] <+jiggy_snipe> Rosco Kappa
[3:27:47] <CursedNobleman> what girl?
[3:27:53] <CyberDingus> Maybe he is?
[3:27:58] <Coystick> Punk fairy in the distance
[3:27:58] <Srthunda> where else would one live
[3:28:00] <ahaegotrigger> idk it was cool
[3:28:03] <CursedNobleman> ah
[3:28:07] <Samex_Comex> He looked a Don Bluth character
[3:28:07] <ahaegotrigger> LUL
[3:28:08] <KaiserMario> meth?
[3:28:13] <%bettysharkface> Meth warlocks
[3:28:16] <JailShmixRemix> Meth and magic are pretty much the same thing
[3:28:31] <OperatorJo_> Meth warlocks huh.
[3:28:43] <CyberDingus> ''Meth'' and ''warlock'' make too much sense together.
[3:28:48] <CursedNobleman> DansGame
[3:28:51] <%bettysharkface> Methlock.
[3:28:56] <theidealheight> PogChamp
[3:29:00] <Coystick> She's wearing booty short relax
[3:29:03] <YakumoYomi> Eli... psaSmug
[3:29:05] <@DCN2049> it's the ritualistic substance they use to commune with their patron
[3:29:20] <Coystick> Haaay gurl.
[3:29:22] <+cursedwithadhd> Yeah Go Magic! BITCH!

[3:29:27] <Coystick> yeyeeye

[3:29:30] <ahaegotrigger> wait go back
[3:29:39] <Coystick> zoom in
[3:29:41] <KaiserMario> She cute af
[3:29:42] <Coystick> noo go back
[3:29:58] <CursedNobleman> the thirst is real.
[3:30:15] <+Scevda> truth
[3:30:21] <CursedNobleman> LUL
[3:30:25] <+Rotanimood> did you just roast that chicken
[3:30:29] <CyberDingus> Eli they are fantasy dumb chickens
[3:30:30] <%bettysharkface> Chickens are also fucking idiots sometimes though.
[3:30:35] <+Scevda> Chicken wire is quite tight
[3:30:39] <OperatorJo_> normal
[3:30:50] <YakumoYomi> My dog also likes chicken. Unfortunately, she's allergic.
[3:30:54] <KaiserMario> Give that dog a restraining order
[3:31:04] <Coystick> Chickens love to die, this is known
[3:31:17] <ahaegotrigger> Chickens love death and being tasty
[3:31:26] <+SWindleFeD> Chickens, born to die, life is a fuck
[3:31:37] <Coystick> All chickens have vore fetish
[3:31:52] <%bettysharkface> I have one smart chicken and two that are on the shallow end of the gene pool.
[3:31:53] <cahv123> You just described some people I've known.
[3:31:54] <YakumoYomi> Elelater go down the whole?
[3:32:15] <+thegalvanicpanic> we had a chicken get crushed under some lumber we had lying around. didnt find it until a day after it had basically exploded all over the wood. fun times
[3:32:23] <CyberDingus> pig dragon
[3:32:24] <ahaegotrigger> Yup
[3:32:25] <KaiserMario> LORE
[3:32:25] <Aussie_Manny> THX, bye, Felicia.
[3:32:26] <+thegreenbenis> I like that design
[3:32:30] <+Scevda> It just turned into the fairy.
[3:32:35] <Samex_Comex> He's one those turtles with the long nose
[3:32:49] <bazz_tv> it has a soft shell turtle nose
[3:33:14] <KaiserMario> Your eyes have corners?!
[3:33:19] <SuperVaderMan> They spent enough time modeling all the dragons, I guess they didn't want to take much longer doing voicework and animating? idk
[3:33:23] <Aussie_Manny> Get back, get back! M... Mr Pig, NOOOOOO! chairNooooo
[3:33:46] <bazz_tv> yeah I couldn't tell
[3:33:55] <%bettysharkface> Metaphysically opposed to platformers.
[3:33:55] <Korndogg10> Have they done a game where spyro is older ?
[3:33:58] <CyberDingus> @SuperVaderMan nah, some dragons are like this
[3:34:08] <Aussie_Manny> Randy Savage?!?! PogChamp
[3:34:19] <+jiggy_snipe> LUL
[3:34:21] <theidealheight> daddy
[3:34:22] <ahaegotrigger> maybe
[3:34:22] <laserbeaming> they may be
[3:34:24] <simon__well> Yep
[3:34:25] <Schlongalong> maybe
[3:34:25] <ahaegotrigger> YES
[3:34:27] <SuperVaderMan> Classic dragons
[3:34:27] <CyberDingus> Absolutely.
[3:34:29] <+jiggy_snipe> RACE WAR
[3:34:30] <ahaegotrigger> thats the whole story
[3:34:30] <cahv123> I mean....
[3:34:34] <simon__well> Dragons are way cooler though
[3:34:39] <+SWindleFeD> The dragons are so damn racist
[3:34:39] <CyberDingus> All Dragons Are Racists
[3:34:42] <bazz_tv> Gnorcs were asking for it though
[3:35:11] <Aussie_Manny> Is it racist if several other races hate one specific race? 🤔
[3:35:24] <Tebrial> gotta fly onto a platform near the level exit
[3:35:34] <bazz_tv> from the altar
[3:35:37] <CaptHat211> Racist, Bored, Elitist, Wise, or Mindless Monsters. That's what they usually are in fiction.
[3:36:06] <ahaegotrigger> POG
[3:36:14] <Aussie_Manny> wp
[3:36:17] <Aussie_Manny> wp, eli
[3:36:18] <+thegreenbenis> Are these like weird cajun aztec ruins
[3:36:23] <KaiserMario> Like Geralt
[3:36:31] <brutalgenie> triangle while gliding makes you flutter
[3:36:31] <laserbeaming> those are some really good reverse kinematics when he was on that edge
[3:36:45] <bazz_tv> and the original didn't even had an analogue stick
[3:36:53] <Aussie_Manny> u won't make it
[3:36:54] <ahaegotrigger> yes now you see it
[3:36:55] <Coystick> Pretty
[3:36:57] <+CrimsonDio11> hey @PlagueOfGripes will you be playing FF14 when 5.3 releases or are you going to wait till the next expac to play ff14 again?
[3:36:57] <Aussie_Manny> u made it
[3:37:19] <Aussie_Manny> ez
[3:37:39] <Aussie_Manny> omg so many chaos emeralds! PogChamp
[3:37:59] <CyberDingus> @PlagueOfGripes why so sure?
[3:38:03] <Samex_Comex> Rothgar?
[3:38:14] <+SWindleFeD> @Samex_Comex the Lion people
[3:38:19] <Aussie_Manny> omg female kimahri whennnnn?????
[3:38:30] <Samex_Comex> Oh that guy from 10
[3:38:37] <CyberDingus> One can still be hopeful
[3:38:45] <Senterami> the story gets bitter
[3:39:00] <Aussie_Manny> No, only save story interest for big games, like Death Stranding.
[3:39:02] <bazz_tv> the issue is that YOU care
[3:39:08] <+arancet> never played 14, how is it good but they dont care?
[3:39:16] <Meowbringer> they dont care about the story but for some reason you have to play through it.
[3:39:16] <$Rivalshotzgp> Yea getting to 80 only to realize that feels weird
[3:39:20] <Aussie_Manny> They're called "Push Cats".
[3:39:30] <KaiserMario> Aren't Viera the female Hrothgar?
[3:39:30] <+SWindleFeD> Rhonso is what they're called in 10 iirc
[3:39:56] <@DCN2049> it's terribly overwritten
[3:40:02] <Tebrial> I hear that the later expansion's stories are genuinely good. but the fact that it takes time to get there is a bit of an issue.
[3:40:03] <+SWindleFeD> It feels like Squeenix is making the story up as they go
[3:40:08] <Nomenanza> @KaiserMario nah Viera are just sex bunny women
[3:40:10] <$Rivalshotzgp> Everyone hyped up that villain and I REALLY don’t get it
[3:40:28] <bazz_tv> the frogs attack first
[3:40:45] <CyberDingus> Viera are love
[3:40:50] <bazz_tv> prioritize them
[3:40:50] <CyberDingus> Viera are life
[3:41:16] <+SWindleFeD> The bunny people in 14 have the best accent
[3:41:19] <%Rezca> Damon, he's Da Mon
[3:41:24] <KaiserMario> Potion Seller!
[3:41:25] <Meowbringer> nice hat
[3:41:26] <Aussie_Manny> He's a rather large bearded dragon. O_O
[3:41:28] <Coystick> Senile
[3:41:37] <Coystick> S e n i l e
[3:41:38] <ahaegotrigger> yep
[3:41:46] <cherubs_anonymous> Plague plz
[3:41:48] <CyberDingus> Senile
[3:41:49] <bazz_tv> the joke is that he is old
[3:41:49] <+JonWhoLovesFlatWomen> he's ooooooooold
[3:41:54] <simon__well> Does the seriousness of a story effect how much bad plot mistakes feel for you?
[3:41:56] <ahaegotrigger> no it hapened like a day agao at most
[3:41:57] <+Scevda> Don't feel too bad about the dragon has dementia, it got to be president after all
[3:42:05] <Nomenanza> wait he has hooves???
[3:42:20] <Aussie_Manny> 500
[3:42:22] <whittacre> the teeth are definitely the worst part
[3:42:23] <laserbeaming> 100%!
[3:42:24] <bazz_tv> don't be mean to sparks he is a good boy
[3:42:24] <YakumoYomi> Wait...Sparx has hooves and human teeth?
[3:42:33] <ahaegotrigger> Pog
[3:42:37] <ahaegotrigger> poggers
[3:42:41] <bazz_tv> and once he was voiced by Billy West
[3:42:42] <Coystick> You can just exit level on options
[3:42:55] <KaiserMario> Wow, took you less than a minute...
[3:43:30] <SuperVaderMan> Spryo's a little special, ok
[3:43:45] <ahaegotrigger> its kinda hilarious
[3:43:48] <YakumoYomi> It could be problematic if there's a timed situation that involves stairs
[3:44:16] <ahaegotrigger> I kinda love/hate this area
[3:44:20] <bazz_tv> oh boy
[3:44:36] <SirFancySwank> have fun with this one
[3:44:42] <bazz_tv> the dark souls of spyro levels incoming
[3:44:47] <ahaegotrigger> yes
[3:44:48] <KaiserMario> Are Cletusses and Bubbas the "Karens" of hillbillys?
[3:44:51] <Nomenanza> oh really
[3:44:54] <Nomenanza> that bad huh
[3:44:55] <ahaegotrigger> youll probably hate it
[3:45:00] <theidealheight> go pee!
[3:45:04] <ahaegotrigger> but you might not
[3:45:09] <%bettysharkface> It's a little monkey fella
[3:45:14] <+FourthTundra> oh god this level
[3:45:16] <ahaegotrigger> I hope they are
[3:45:17] <SuperVaderMan> ohhh, banana
[3:45:23] <YakumoYomi> Shit throwing orangutans?
[3:45:41] <Nomenanza> it feels like they are
[3:45:47] <bazz_tv> speciesist
[3:45:50] <ahaegotrigger> maybe
[3:45:52] <YakumoYomi> If they spoke in Jive...
[3:45:59] <+thegreenbenis> Maybe to Orangutangs.
[3:46:04] <Korndogg10> Why are you committing mass genocide on different species lol ?
[3:46:05] <Nomenanza> They have this tribal motif maybe that is why
[3:46:14] <ahaegotrigger> yes you czn
[3:46:21] <ahaegotrigger> jump through the window
[3:46:25] <KaiserMario> Time it good
[3:46:27] <laserbeaming> you can just jump
[3:46:32] <Nomenanza> does spyro flutter in this one if you jump again during the glide?
[3:46:36] <whittacre> how has plague still not figured out Y for the hop up at the end?
[3:46:43] <laserbeaming> spyro jumps pretty high
[3:46:55] <bazz_tv> pro tip leave the thiefs for later
[3:47:11] <%bettysharkface> Hm
[3:47:11] <bazz_tv> you are gonna need a clean road for them
[3:47:14] <CyberDingus> GOTTAGOFAST
[3:47:25] <ahaegotrigger> Neat
[3:47:27] <KaiserMario> Like Dr Stone?
[3:47:41] <%Rezca> Gotta use the bathroom
[3:47:41] <+thegreenbenis> AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAH
[3:47:44] <CyberDingus> Don't do drugs
[3:47:45] <Senterami> live fast or die trying
[3:47:46] <KaiserMario> Kill me now
[3:47:46] <+thegreenbenis> Screaming
[3:47:47] <i_am_therydon> use the behlit
[3:47:47] <+Konquerer> Don't let it set in
[3:47:48] <CyberDingus> Taxation is theft
[3:47:50] <Mikers29> "wipe at least twice always"
[3:47:50] <laserbeaming> "Spyro, wrap it before you tap it"
[3:47:51] <CyberDingus> Bitches are hoes.
[3:47:52] <terminusterminal> "Bitches ain't shit but hoes and tricks."
[3:47:52] <Nomenanza> "Oh Jesus Christ fresh air agai- oh hey chosen child, check out that raaaaaadical ramp"
[3:47:53] <+thegreenbenis> I would just scream
[3:47:54] <Coystick> This one took me a while
[3:47:55] <AlphaTauri> don't go to college
[3:47:56] <%bettysharkface> Probably just screaming, yeah
[3:47:59] <Samex_Comex> Remember Spryo Righty tighty lefty loosey
[3:48:01] <ahaegotrigger> happiness is a tiny man in a boat
[3:48:02] <CalderGaming> how to kill the final boss
[3:48:03] <+Dova573> man I have so much nostalgia of playing this on old ps1 emulator in an old computer when I was around 8
[3:48:03] <+thegreenbenis> Just screaming
[3:48:08] <YakumoYomi> "Fellatio doesn't count as sex."
[3:48:15] <+arcielardor> Do we have sex-bots yet? No? Put me back in the fridge.
[3:48:15] <terminusterminal> "Be more racist."
[3:48:19] <SuperVaderMan> Come up with a horrid lie just to scare them
[3:48:22] <ruschcoil> give up while your ahead
[3:48:24] <KaiserMario> "I'm covered in BIRD SHIT"
[3:48:28] <+thegalvanicpanic> id tell them about the menu button and disappear
[3:48:30] <+MrPhysics21> Try not to get stabbed,m I guess
[3:48:33] <Tebrial> Always make sure your bladder is empty before doing anything
[3:48:39] <+thegreenbenis> "She's still a virgin if you stick it in her butt, spyro"
[3:48:39] <Coystick> The Universe is a lie and we are all born to die
[3:48:40] <+thegalvanicpanic> like there's no button at all but just fuck em up
[3:48:42] <%bettysharkface> Oh wow
[3:48:45] <Nomenanza> Well, technically they SHOULD come out screaming cuz if you think about it, they should just continue doing whatever they were busy with prior to becoming stonbe
[3:48:48] <bazz_tv> I'm just a living statue kid
[3:48:52] <ahaegotrigger> LUL
[3:48:55] <$SomeNEET> "Don't jerk off more than three times in a given day!"
[3:49:10] <Nomenanza> Unless this game says they are completely aware of everything during their statue state
[3:49:20] <Nomenanza> the implications of which are horrifying
[3:49:23] <snackbowl> I would stay still and pretend to still be frozen
[3:49:32] <+thegreenbenis> Now you're murdering children
[3:49:33] <ahaegotrigger> its banana sounds
[3:49:34] <theloganbrand> the scalie noises
[3:49:34] <YakumoYomi> That's the sound of family friendly murder.
[3:49:37] <bazz_tv> nah
[3:49:38] <SirFancySwank> yes
[3:49:42] <eldercat> "I wish it was someone else."
[3:49:43] <ahaegotrigger> yes
[3:49:50] <Coystick> "I wasn't turned to stone, that was just my dried cummies"
[3:49:51] <$SomeNEET> Would you care if your kid was that thing?
[3:49:53] <Nomenanza> I mena, old people are just children with beards and wrinkles
[3:49:55] <+Dova573> the children and the women too, Like ANIMALS
[3:49:57] <bazz_tv> they are dwarves
[3:49:57] <%Too_Much_Nukie> You're ending families for sure.

[3:50:08] <%Rezca> Awww
[3:50:15] <bazz_tv> you jumped too soon
[3:50:26] <%bettysharkface> bananasounds.mp3
[3:50:30] <%bettysharkface> Oh weird
[3:50:31] <Meowbringer> ew
[3:50:38] <+SWindleFeD> This level was bullshit in the original because of draw distance
[3:50:39] <Nomenanza> it looks like a weird rabbit x monkey hybrid
[3:50:40] <AlphaTauri> they look happy
[3:50:41] <moonsaber99> Kill it
[3:50:43] <Coystick> Swollen and red
[3:50:43] <ahaegotrigger> oh christ
[3:50:45] <%Rezca> matted in to the fur
[3:50:48] <laserbeaming> might be a different species
[3:50:50] <+Dova573> Inbred monkeys?
[3:50:51] <$SomeNEET> absolutely C A K E D in faeces
[3:50:51] <CyberDingus> Ooga Booga!
[3:50:52] <Coystick> Oh no
[3:50:54] <CursedNobleman> stanky boi
[3:50:54] <ahaegotrigger> that thing is DIGUSTING
[3:50:56] <Coystick> Isolate that
[3:50:57] <%bettysharkface> Oof
[3:50:57] <+Baresenio> Bruh
[3:50:58] <laserbeaming> quote him on that
[3:50:59] <Nomenanza> unfortunate
[3:51:04] <ahaegotrigger> LUL
[3:51:09] <+jiggy_snipe> LUL
[3:51:10] <ahaegotrigger> it needs to be done
[3:51:22] <Nomenanza> Do it Spyro. Run and spout flames until it is done.
[3:51:25] <CursedNobleman> probably the most complex level
[3:51:26] <Coystick> Torch and Charge, until it is done
[3:51:29] <ahaegotrigger> the dragons ponce again need to purify the earth
[3:51:33] <brutalgenie> They looked even worse in the original imo
[3:51:55] <bazz_tv> so who is gonna tell them about the super charge jumping sequence?
[3:51:57] <ahaegotrigger> this level is BULLSHIT to navigate
[3:52:02] <i_Trevelyan_i> That bass groove thuogh
[3:52:10] <CursedNobleman> you need a map to figure it out.
[3:52:26] <ahaegotrigger> you need a tutorial to 100% this level
[3:52:33] <bazz_tv> And Plague siriously open the minimap
[3:52:34] <ahaegotrigger> its easily the hardest to 100%
[3:52:50] <theidealheight> i used to think it was hard to control, but there is a way to do it
[3:52:52] <Coystick> This one is hard I think you have to charge in the other direction and do a whole circuit
[3:52:57] <CursedNobleman> second hardest is the tower LUL
[3:53:01] <CursedNobleman> minimap in the options
[3:53:03] <%Rezca> options
[3:53:09] <bazz_tv> in options
[3:53:20] <moonsaber99> This level sucks just look up how to do it
[3:53:21] <CursedNobleman> NotLikeThis
[3:53:27] <CalderGaming> y tho
[3:53:29] <+hgtarras> Mini maps were not created then
[3:53:30] <+cursedwithadhd> theres that 7 second wisdom " if it looks horrific, kill it"
[3:53:33] <CyberDingus> Because Eil!
[3:53:33] <Coystick> Hahahahaha
[3:53:34] <Nomenanza> oh wow
[3:53:34] <CyberDingus> BECAUSE
[3:53:36] <KaiserMario> LUL
[3:53:36] <Korndogg10> Imagine being able to fly and dying because you fell LUL
[3:53:38] <Nomenanza> why is it hidden
[3:53:39] <+TheEvaFreak> It wasn't in the first game
[3:53:50] <KaiserMario> Fuck you, that's why
[3:53:50] <%Rezca> Gotta appreciate the graphics
[3:53:51] <bazz_tv> because the original didn't had a map
[3:53:52] <Coystick> i m m e r s i o n
[3:53:55] <ahaegotrigger> LUL
[3:53:57] <theidealheight> it wasnt there in the original
[3:53:59] <CalderGaming> even if it is a remaster-only feature, turn it on by default!
[3:53:59] <Samex_Comex> So it's like you rememeber
[3:54:00] <Nomenanza> iirc Spyro 2 had a map
[3:54:06] <ahaegotrigger> YES
[3:54:07] <+bagool3058> Because it's a game for 7 year olds and you don't need a map.
[3:54:11] <CyberDingus> @PlagueOfGripes well you see youngster, back in my day we had to figure shit out without a map like the youngsters these days
[3:54:13] <SuperVaderMan> Convenience is for suckers
[3:54:14] <Coystick> Yeyeye, clean HUDSquad
[3:54:17] <CursedNobleman> you navigate this level with tufts of wind
[3:54:27] <%bettysharkface> That was a good face
[3:54:29] <%bettysharkface> Hahaha
[3:54:31] <+hgtarras> The map probably takes away the cinematic experience man
[3:54:35] <Coystick> Spyro could really use a Kurosawa Mode
[3:54:42] <%treemanfour> Spyro Craves Death
[3:54:45] <CursedNobleman> and play it with dubs like a true weeb
[3:54:49] <Zig95> this level is a PAIN to 100% i wont blame you if you leave lol
[3:54:51] <YakumoYomi> Eli, why do you berate your son so?
[3:54:54] <Samex_Comex> Aw yeah Cool runnings
[3:54:55] <laserbeaming> It's more like the Elder Scrolls Arena of Spyro
[3:55:07] <bazz_tv> but yeah you might need a legit tutorial for this, this sequence is not obvious and not easy either
[3:55:10] <Nomenanza> If it were to be Morrowind of Spyro you'd have to spam jump button like 100 times for a chance that Spyro would jump
[3:55:15] <Nomenanza> and then run out of stamina
[3:55:22] <Coystick> I had to look up a video
[3:55:26] <CursedNobleman> you have to chain superjump ramps. its a bitch
[3:55:37] <+cursedwithadhd> only if Sir Stewart voices the king of the dragons
[3:55:39] <CyberDingus> Eli if you want to know exactly how just ask the chat goblins
[3:55:48] <CursedNobleman> yeah, just leave LUL
[3:55:53] <CursedNobleman> no, not like that
[3:55:53] <Coystick> Not like that
[3:56:01] <CursedNobleman> go to the center island i think
[3:56:01] <+bagool3058> You don't go through, you go around.
[3:56:02] <ahaegotrigger> Yeah Exactly
[3:56:02] <Coystick> No just do it
[3:56:10] <CyberDingus> No 90 degrees old farmer!
[3:56:11] <Coystick> ezpz
[3:56:13] <ahaegotrigger> LUL
[3:56:22] <bazz_tv> you have to jump from a ramp early to the side
[3:56:23] <ahaegotrigger> yes
[3:56:24] <YakumoYomi> Do it, though.
[3:56:30] <SirFancySwank> its the hardest level in the game
[3:56:35] <CyberDingus> You are at the section that you should use.
[3:56:37] <KaiserMario> No you can't, YOU CAN'T
[3:56:38] <ThisGamingDragon> "Spyro is a dumb game for children"
[3:56:46] <Coystick> I thought you were a gameR
[3:56:47] <Nomenanza> I wish life worked like that. "Oh I fucked up in this document, lemme just kill myself real quick and erase that mistake"
[3:56:48] <ahaegotrigger> Exactly
[3:56:49] <CalderGaming> psa1guy
[3:56:51] <CursedNobleman> its the hardest level to 100 in spyro 1 LUL
[3:56:57] <terminusterminal> That's one hell of a sidebar. I can see the suffering in that model's eyes.
[3:56:59] <laserbeaming> this is a weird game
[3:57:04] <%bettysharkface> Hahahah
[3:57:10] <ahaegotrigger> EXACTLY
[3:57:12] <+SirGO0SE> PogChamp
[3:57:14] <Zig95> this might be the hardest level in the 1st game
[3:57:15] <CyberDingus> Eli please, kid me solved this, and kid me was retarded.
[3:57:19] <bazz_tv> some even say this is hardest point of the trilogy actually
[3:57:33] <KaiserMario> ANd also mimics and invisible doors
[3:57:37] <alextrebeken> cause kids will put up with a lot of video game BS
[3:57:46] <CyberDingus> D E N I E D
[3:57:50] <YakumoYomi> Not allowed
[3:57:51] <laserbeaming> there's some invis walls
[3:57:53] <Coystick> Tru;y this is the Dark Souls of 8 year olds
[3:58:07] <CursedNobleman> if memory serves, you shoot down this ramp and shoot to the right
[3:58:12] <CyberDingus> No 180 old man!
[3:58:14] <Nomenanza> Oh my god, what is the "no, not that one" from. My mind jumps to fucking Starfox adventures for some reason
[3:58:19] <ahaegotrigger> yeah pretty much
[3:58:23] <CyberDingus> Get at the tippy top and take a look
[3:58:25] <ahaegotrigger> its horseshit
[3:58:31] <whittacre> end of the ramp, to the right
[3:58:31] <%mongorific> mongorific subscribed with Twitch Prime. They've subscribed for 13 months! 
[3:58:32] <bazz_tv> just watch a video
[3:58:37] <CursedNobleman> use this ramp, and at the bottom turn right maybe 30degrees or something to another ramp
[3:59:10] <KaiserMario> C'mon Plague, I beat this at age 8
[3:59:10] <CursedNobleman> its a ps1 game, whatcha gonna do
[3:59:24] <ThisGamingDragon> Why is level difficult?
[3:59:33] <+pittpanther84> Yeah I didn't like this level when I played this.
[3:59:35] <+cursedwithadhd> half way up that spiral ramp there is a vortex up
[3:59:36] <Nomenanza> back in the day when gamedesign was more of trial and error
[3:59:42] <theidealheight> "pretty princess"
[3:59:43] <+SirGO0SE> I'm a little cutie :)
[3:59:46] <YakumoYomi> Facecam really brings life to these Plague-isms
[3:59:50] <KaiserMario> But you ARE a cutie, Eli
[4:00:06] <SuperVaderMan> But turds tho
[4:00:11] <bazz_tv> wow you sounded like Stamper for a second there Plague
[4:00:15] <Nomenanza> the fact that the guy himself says it is tasty already implies he not only sniffs his own farts but also sucks his own dick
[4:00:17] <CyberDingus> Eli they give you free bananas!
[4:00:22] <ahaegotrigger> Like I said banana sounds
[4:00:37] <+RooddlesMcgriF> why's it gotta be like that
[4:00:39] <theidealheight> eat the ass bananas, eli
[4:00:41] <KaiserMario> They are chain smokers
[4:00:45] <%treemanfour> Plague, are you a fan of Them there classical dragonquesty RPGs
[4:00:46] <ThisGamingDragon> I honestly hate most of the new enemy designs in this game
[4:00:58] <CursedNobleman> get on the ramp shinji
[4:01:09] <YakumoYomi> Right under Lust
[4:01:22] <whittacre> dragonfruit
[4:01:23] <+pittpanther84> Dragon Fruit
[4:01:23] <Nomenanza> Huuuh
[4:01:29] <CyberDingus> @ThisGamingDragon they turned guns into super soakers at the last levels.
[4:01:32] <ahaegotrigger> LUL
[4:01:32] <+RooddlesMcgriF> is that a dragon fruit?
[4:01:32] <CyberDingus> That's bullshit.
[4:01:35] <Dapper_Cactuar> oh god this level
[4:01:48] <Nomenanza> "this republican dragon site said so!"
[4:01:50] <+cursedwithadhd> just smile and nod
[4:02:01] <CursedNobleman> no. not like this
[4:02:02] <ahaegotrigger> YES
[4:02:10] <ahaegotrigger> THE MOST BULLSHIT JUMP
[4:02:10] <Coystick> I can't wait for Plague to have "Trouble With the Trolley"
[4:02:15] <CursedNobleman> LUL
[4:02:19] <ahaegotrigger> oh look it up
[4:02:23] <ahaegotrigger> youll LOVE IT
[4:02:27] <Dapper_Cactuar> welcome to the most infamous level in the series
[4:02:29] <CursedNobleman> YES
[4:02:33] <CyberDingus> Eli, this level demands you to explore. A bit annoying, but fun at the end.
[4:02:39] <ThisGamingDragon> "trouble with the trolley, eh?"
[4:02:39] <SirFancySwank> its part of the supercharfe chain
[4:02:45] <laserbeaming> Nothing else in the other games gets as bad as this
[4:03:08] <ahaegotrigger> its those 5 jumps into a glide
[4:03:12] <theloganbrand> Your bed actually looks made, Eli.
[4:03:15] <bazz_tv> ok Plague just use the ramp, jump to the right then you jump from the other ramp to the left, the trick is all the jumps are early
[4:03:23] <ThisGamingDragon> Plague don't pretend this soundtrack ain't something short of heaven.
[4:03:49] <Coystick> The zebra striped bedding is sensual
[4:03:53] <%bettysharkface> Truck Shepard?
[4:04:25] <ThisGamingDragon> you have to hold the charge button btw
[4:04:33] <bazz_tv> for the chest no, but for the thieve, you are gonna need the momentum
[4:04:52] <KaiserMario> "replay value"
[4:05:31] <Schlongalong> ?
[4:05:40] <ThisGamingDragon> in the PS1 game it might be easier to see. which would be the remakes fault
[4:06:02] <Schlongalong> that and the weird old men
[4:06:08] <bazz_tv> the level is not clear
[4:06:13] <CyberDingus> The midgets give you bananas though
[4:06:42] <CyberDingus> And most of the soundtrack was slowed down and mellowed. Lame.
[4:06:45] <bazz_tv> did you put the ost in classic mode?
[4:06:58] <%Rezca> The chest
[4:07:02] <@Nightbot> Plague is a youtube animator and also streams at https://picarto.tv/Plague . Also: t-shirts! http://goo.gl/lze8QO
[4:07:03] <KaiserMario> THE CHEST
[4:07:04] <laserbeaming> I always mute the games I work on
[4:07:06] <CyberDingus> Eli, KEY
[4:07:11] <+TheEvaFreak> plague the chest
[4:07:21] <whittacre> no, go right at the jump
[4:07:25] <Coystick> It doesn't really make an impression. I remember one or two of the overworld themes are chill
[4:07:27] <+jiggy_snipe> get the chest
[4:07:32] <bazz_tv> i feel the dynamic ost mutes the themes too much
[4:07:32] <%bettysharkface> This is gonna break the Plague, I can smell it
[4:07:34] <CyberDingus> Eli you old farmer you are RIGHT NOW on the section you should RUN over
[4:07:49] <laserbeaming> I mean, you can just say "fuck this level" and go back to the hub
[4:07:53] <Coystick> Plague is happy he has a bad level to fight
[4:08:16] <CursedNobleman> go down this ramp, and list to the right
[4:08:19] <+jiggy_snipe> LUL
[4:08:29] <CursedNobleman> ehh... explaining is too hard
[4:08:36] <CalderGaming> those bonks are annoying
[4:08:45] <bazz_tv> you need to get to the place with the dragon
[4:08:56] <Coystick> Go down the ramp, and then go Weast
[4:09:03] <Samex_Comex> The guy who did the music was the Drummer for the band Police
[4:09:13] <terminusterminal> blackface to mean lowhealth
[4:09:17] <+jiggy_snipe> LUL
[4:09:35] <Coystick> Makes sense
[4:09:37] <CyberDingus> Game Logic
[4:09:40] <Meowbringer> god i missed you plague
[4:09:48] <+pittpanther84> There is a cheat to make Spyro black
[4:10:01] <%Rezca> oh, I think I see the link
[4:10:02] <+QuietusPlays> But the dragon can fly and he has a dragonfly. see it all works
[4:10:05] <Coystick> "What if we had a Hedgehog, that ran fast?"
[4:10:28] <%bettysharkface> Little monkey fella
[4:10:29] <%Rezca> Look to the right of that ramp
[4:10:31] <%bettysharkface> Flying around
[4:10:32] <CyberDingus> Old games were made with DRUGS, Eil
[4:10:36] <CyberDingus> Don't question.
[4:10:44] <+bagool3058> YOU DON'T
[4:10:46] <Schlongalong> lol
[4:10:48] <laserbeaming> I don't think it's like this
[4:10:51] <+TheEvaFreak> You dont jump there
[4:10:51] <Nomenanza> I mean at least you hit that face right on the spot
[4:10:52] <+QuietusPlays> @Coystick do you think they put the shoes on the hedgehog before they said "now make him fast"
[4:10:57] <CyberDingus> Eli you silly baka, you are going to the WRONG direction
[4:11:00] <Coystick> Go. WEAST.
[4:11:00] <bazz_tv> Plague this is not THE ramp
[4:11:02] <whittacre> GO RIGHT AT THE JUMP NOT AFTER
[4:11:09] <+TheEvaFreak> you have to go right off of the first jump
[4:11:16] <%Rezca> look at the end of the end again
[4:11:20] <ahaegotrigger> yeah cause FUCK THIS LEVEL
[4:11:21] <+bagool3058> HERE
[4:11:22] <%Rezca> end of the ramp
[4:11:24] <CursedNobleman> plague, we cant really explain what to do via chat. watch a video or check a map
[4:11:25] <bazz_tv> you have to do it from the ramp with the monkeys
[4:11:35] <@TheDropOutDragon> I've come to three different streams when this game was being played, and they all were at this exact spot.
[4:11:35] <Coystick> I'm dying
[4:11:36] <Waypastfuture> yeah right into the upwards spiral you always return to
[4:11:40] <@TheDropOutDragon> Hey Plague.
[4:11:48] <+goddamndavid> does Spyro or anyone acknowledge the dragonfly?
[4:11:49] <whittacre> not this
[4:11:56] <@TheDropOutDragon> It's been a bit. But that's okay.
[4:11:58] <@TheDropOutDragon> I've been busy.
[4:12:00] <CyberDingus> Eli, think like an 8 years old.
[4:12:10] <@TheDropOutDragon> How the fuck do you blame me?
[4:12:12] <+PureDemon1> I saw the title and I thought, eh there's a lot worse furry things than Spyro
[4:12:18] <%Rezca> aye
[4:12:19] <CursedNobleman> correct
[4:12:20] <+TheEvaFreak> correct
[4:12:21] <CyberDingus> YES
[4:12:22] <+bagool3058> YES
[4:12:22] <Nomenanza> @TheDropOutDragon clearly, cuz you have a Dragon in the name
[4:12:27] <CursedNobleman> land on the bottom of that ramp
[4:12:29] <%Rezca> Aye
[4:12:32] <Samex_Comex> Check the Discord for Plague dressed like a dragon
[4:12:33] <CyberDingus> IN ORDER TO GO FORWARD YOU NEED TO GO BACK, ELI
[4:12:39] <CyberDingus> basic anime logic
[4:12:48] <KaiserMario> Good luck
[4:12:50] <CursedNobleman> and dont lose your charge momentum
[4:12:50] <Coystick> Hey Weast was actually half right
[4:12:51] <@TheDropOutDragon> I don't even like Spyro all that much how the fuck is it my fault?
[4:12:51] <ThisGamingDragon> I think the dragonfly was part of their design philosophy where they wanted to make "a game that you're grandmother could play"
[4:12:52] <ahaegotrigger> https://clips.twitch.tv/PiliableVainShieldPogChamp
[4:13:03] <+PureDemon1> have to go back, back to the past
[4:13:06] <CursedNobleman> well. thats a start
[4:13:08] <whittacre> almost had it
[4:13:09] <CyberDingus> To the RIGHT twise
[4:13:09] <+bagool3058> You head right at the part you fell at.
[4:13:09] <KaiserMario> Good try chap
[4:13:10] <Coystick> A good try
[4:13:10] <+TheEvaFreak> you were doing pretty good
[4:13:11] <CyberDingus> you old farmer.
[4:13:12] <CalderGaming> on the right track
[4:13:21] <theidealheight> go grandpa!
[4:13:22] <SuperVaderMan> Hey, you made the jump on the first try LUL
[4:13:26] <+TheEvaFreak> had to go over the spikey wall
[4:13:33] <Coystick> Scout ahead
[4:13:42] <CyberDingus> TORCHES
[4:13:42] <CursedNobleman> right
[4:13:45] <CursedNobleman> over the fence
[4:13:46] <whittacre> over the spikes
[4:13:53] <SirFancySwank> right
[4:13:53] <%bettysharkface> Oh god fuck that
[4:13:55] <Coystick> Over the wood spikes
[4:13:58] <+TheEvaFreak> yes you can and do
[4:13:58] <+silvery_cricket> Imagine playing this with the original dualshock
[4:13:59] <CyberDingus> You need to JUMP desu
[4:14:01] <CursedNobleman> youll shoot over the fence
[4:14:02] <Nomenanza> Spyro: Reignited (Hatred) Trilogy
[4:14:05] <whittacre> left is where the first ramp goes
[4:14:11] <KaiserMario> Pray for success
[4:14:12] <Coystick> It's VERY counter intuitive
[4:14:14] <SuperVaderMan> This level sucks
[4:14:15] <bazz_tv> in case you gave up https://youtu.be/0XD3P7lfOlI
[4:14:16] <ahaegotrigger> IT DOES
[4:14:17] <laserbeaming> it does suck
[4:14:18] <CursedNobleman> plague, we arent making you play this level LUL
[4:14:22] <%bettysharkface> Big suck
[4:14:24] <Meowbringer> indeed
[4:14:25] <ahaegotrigger> It sucks in a horrible HORRIBLE way
[4:14:26] <bazz_tv> at 3:20
[4:14:27] <CyberDingus> Little me was amazed how smart I was when I figured it. YOU can do it too, Eli
[4:14:32] <@TheDropOutDragon> You suck.
[4:14:33] <Coystick> You're correct, shit level
[4:14:45] <theidealheight> Eli you can give up at any time

[4:15:17] <ThisGamingDragon> Plague that wasn't hard
[4:15:17] <Coystick> PlagueOfGODS
[4:15:20] <+silvery_cricket> Now imagine doing it with the original playstation controller plague

[4:15:23] <ahaegotrigger> nope
[4:15:26] <Meowbringer> gem get

[4:15:31] <bazz_tv> there is another island you need to reach
[4:15:32] <ahaegotrigger> eggman died immediatly
[4:15:40] <ahaegotrigger> Plague rammed into eggmans asshole
[4:15:47] <CyberDingus> 8*
[4:15:47] <Coystick> Validate me Daddy
[4:15:53] <+TheEvaFreak> I don't remember the other route
[4:15:55] <@TheDropOutDragon> haha not real gamer like me with stick and stone controller
[4:16:10] <laserbeaming> Oh, the video @bazz_tv shows the jump. It's bullshit and there's no way chat can describe how to do it
[4:16:21] <@TheDropOutDragon> make fire go left with breath haha those days you are now gate kept
[4:16:25] <CyberDingus> You can figure it out Eli
[4:16:26] <+silvery_cricket> I wonder if playstation will ever make original playstation usb controllers like Xbox made with the Duke
[4:16:30] <CyberDingus> Believe it!
[4:16:30] <CursedNobleman> a far left itsland
[4:16:31] <ahaegotrigger> leave this accursed place
[4:16:31] <Nomenanza> @TheDropOutDragon what?
[4:16:32] <+TheEvaFreak> it that thing on the far left of the map
[4:16:34] <CursedNobleman> i forget which
[4:16:52] <CursedNobleman> thats the end of the jump
[4:17:10] <+silvery_cricket> consume bathroom and eat bathroom

[4:17:26] <+jiggy_snipe> make sure Pat pays you Kappa
[4:17:47] <whittacre> thats it
[4:17:48] <whittacre> yeah
[4:18:49] <ahaegotrigger> isnt it great
[4:18:49] <CursedNobleman> okay. i looked up a vid of how to get to the stupid island
[4:18:52] <@TheDropOutDragon> Why are you pointing that out to me?
[4:18:53] <ahaegotrigger> I mean oh no
[4:18:56] <@TheDropOutDragon> It is gross.
[4:19:01] <CyberDingus> tiny fairy vaginas
[4:19:01] <@TheDropOutDragon> Y'know what else is gross? The color purple.
[4:19:08] <%Rezca> what does Tinkerbell wear at Disneyworld?
[4:19:22] <theidealheight> dont shame the comando fairies
[4:19:39] <YakumoYomi> Wait, the color or the movie?
[4:19:43] <theloganbrand> I don't care for the end of his tail
[4:19:43] <CursedNobleman> is eli going for the last dragon island?
[4:20:18] <bazz_tv> This is the only time the series ask this level of mastery over the supercharge
[4:20:33] <CursedNobleman> ramp to the island in front, then turn to the right
[4:20:52] <whittacre> OH I REMEMBER
[4:20:59] <whittacre> this one is bullshit
[4:21:20] <CursedNobleman> starting on that first island, draw a square going up right down right then to the distant island
[4:21:23] <%bettysharkface> Yeesh
[4:21:24] <ahaegotrigger> LUL PERFECT
[4:21:24] <bazz_tv> So don't be afraid of repeated cases of this type of level design later
[4:21:24] <+kaniasaurus> wrap all the way around back onto the reverse of the middle ramp
[4:21:26] <CursedNobleman> up right down left*
[4:21:37] <@TheDropOutDragon> I gotta smoke.
[4:21:40] <@TheDropOutDragon> Good luck.
[4:21:58] <CursedNobleman> go to the right ledge
[4:22:00] <whittacre> hit that island and pull a 180 to the right
[4:22:10] <CursedNobleman> look right
[4:22:10] <@TheDropOutDragon> I didn't play this I can't help you.
[4:22:14] <Nomenanza> the smoke fumes will eventually reach your location and envigorate you
[4:22:18] <Nomenanza> all according to plan
[4:22:22] <bazz_tv> There is another ramp
[4:22:32] <%Rezca> more right
[4:22:33] <CursedNobleman> you halook more right
[4:22:41] <CursedNobleman> that ramp
[4:22:46] <EuropanLamprey> I just got here, is Plague battling One Guy?
[4:22:49] <Coystick> Going Weast is sure sounding better by the second isn't it?
[4:22:54] <ahaegotrigger> you do
[4:23:05] <CyberDingus> Eli I have faith in you!
[4:23:05] <CursedNobleman> you need to ramp onto 4 islands. north. east. south. west
[4:23:08] <CursedNobleman> turning right each time
[4:23:14] <ahaegotrigger> ITS HARD TO EXPLAIN
[4:23:14] <laserbeaming> you have to take a HARD right after the ramp. It's dumb
[4:23:21] <+kaniasaurus> goUP the middle ramp to jump on the ramp that points at the island
[4:23:30] <laserbeaming> You'd have to look at a video
[4:23:33] <CursedNobleman> no
[4:23:35] <whittacre> you go backwards on a ramp
[4:23:37] <CyberDingus> n0
[4:23:38] <CursedNobleman> look a little left
[4:23:40] <ahaegotrigger> thats too far
[4:23:42] <CursedNobleman> you go backwards up that ramp
[4:23:47] <ahaegotrigger> you have to go up that charge ramp
[4:23:51] <Nomenanza> this is really confusing
[4:23:54] <bazz_tv> Just watch a video, is hard to explain directions
[4:24:00] <CursedNobleman> yes
[4:24:03] <CursedNobleman> yep
[4:24:05] <whittacre> yes
[4:24:05] <ahaegotrigger> yes
[4:24:10] <CursedNobleman> precisely!
[4:24:11] <Coystick> Oh yeah I remember now
[4:24:15] <whittacre> yes, bullshit
[4:24:16] <ahaegotrigger> YES
[4:24:16] <+kaniasaurus> yep
[4:24:16] <CyberDingus> YES
[4:24:17] <%Rezca> my god, that explanation hurt my mind
[4:24:18] <laserbeaming> yes
[4:24:20] <ahaegotrigger> Pain
[4:24:22] <Coystick> God fuck this level
[4:24:25] <laserbeaming> It's pain
[4:24:34] <CyberDingus> a BIT Higher
[4:24:35] <CursedNobleman> perfect
[4:24:35] <ahaegotrigger> HAHAHAHA
[4:24:36] <peachy996> I forget the tricks to this level
[4:24:37] <Coystick> Nailed it
[4:24:38] <+kaniasaurus> lol
[4:24:59] <CyberDingus> Not there
[4:25:02] <laserbeaming> Not from there, from the other ramp
[4:25:03] <ahaegotrigger> no you have more jumps
[4:25:05] <CyberDingus> you absolute potato
[4:25:08] <CursedNobleman> you skipped the amp
[4:25:15] <CursedNobleman> from the end of that island
[4:25:17] <bazz_tv> No from the tree ramp
[4:25:18] <CursedNobleman> you make it.
[4:25:28] <ahaegotrigger> around the tree and up that ramp
[4:25:53] <CyberDingus> Yes, THAT way
[4:25:55] <CursedNobleman> forward to island. right, then go to the end of ramp B
[4:26:01] <Coystick> I love Ramp B
[4:26:02] <CursedNobleman> then go backwards up ramp C
[4:26:05] <CyberDingus> B
[4:26:14] <laserbeaming> you have to use Ramp B
[4:26:17] <%Rezca> Dont forget that Ramp B has a chest after it you have not opened it
[4:26:24] <bazz_tv> A B C
[4:26:28] <ahaegotrigger> yes
[4:26:30] <laserbeaming> yes
[4:26:33] <CursedNobleman> Ramp A, island. Ramp B, land on Ramp C, backwards onto C. then final ramp to island
[4:26:34] <CyberDingus> hai!
[4:26:39] <ahaegotrigger> that is correct sorry for any misunderstanding
[4:26:57] <bazz_tv> C you have to go backwards
[4:26:58] <Coystick> Just do it?
[4:27:00] <laserbeaming> it's really hard to explain

[4:31:31] <@TheDropOutDragon> Y'know what's funny. I know what's there. Because Tekky actually had a lot of trouble with this part, so I did it, it's the only part of this game I've played. I'm a big liar, but I still couldn't help you. That was months ago.

[4:34:38] <conchubar11> only 2 and 3
[4:34:46] <conchubar11> same thing with swimming

[4:39:43] <Nomenanza> @TheDropOutDragon you'd make a good vtuber probably. Jokes aside
[4:39:52] <@TheDropOutDragon> I don't know what a Vtuber is.
[4:39:57] <conchubar11> Plague is lucky they put the Sparx gem guide buttons in this one KEKW

[4:40:30] <ahaegotrigger> yes
[4:40:30] <srkAres> vtubers are the future, old man
[4:40:39] <EuropanLamprey> Vtubers are Japanese SecondLife Youtubers
[4:40:41] <YakumoYomi> It is very gay, and I love Homolive
[4:40:51] <@TheDropOutDragon> Lil' gay, lil' competitive ass fucking. Between bros.
[4:40:53] <conchubar11> is vtube like a discount youtube or soemthing?
[4:41:03] <shinichizio> It's short for 'Virtual Youtuber'
[4:41:11] <laserbeaming> Ranked Competitive Ass Fucking
[4:41:12] <shinichizio> ...somehow.
[4:41:24] <conchubar11> oooohhh yeah, those AI skin cover things he and Paige were talking about
[4:41:31] <HyperBomb21> I love this game. Spyro and his 80 gay dragon dads.
[4:41:32] <DuoMaxwell64> That chicken is talking some mad shit
[4:41:34] <KitsuneManami> It wants to Mate
[4:41:36] <Nomenanza> I like that one frame steps this chicken is making
[4:41:39] <YakumoYomi> The Perfect Guide to Hololive
[4:41:44] <%bettysharkface> It's assuming the position, Plague.
[4:41:47] <peachy996> chicken does its best to annoy you
[4:41:52] <peachy996> basically begging for death
[4:41:53] <@TheDropOutDragon> So is Vtubers like, the RP people on Virtual Chat or whatever?
[4:42:09] <bazz_tv> Remember Plague big enemies fire, metal enemies bashing
[4:42:12] <Nomenanza> well yeah

[4:42:33] <~PlagueOfGripes> https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M_ihlZKVwAI
[4:42:56] <YakumoYomi> Ah, Noel vs. Pekora. Good choice.
[4:42:57] <@TheDropOutDragon> That took five seconds.
[4:43:01] <@TheDropOutDragon> Five, fucking seconds.
[4:43:09] <JailShmixRemix> Pekora!!!!!
[4:43:18] <Aydarkzero> makes sense
[4:43:27] <Samex_Comex> God they are so creepy
[4:43:31] <@TheDropOutDragon> I hate this, so much. It's just facerig but like, RP instead of 'haha I'm sandwhich face'.
[4:43:36] <nightslink> Pekora is so great
[4:43:46] <YakumoYomi> Pekora is the reason I'm trying to push Pat to be a vTuber.
[4:43:48] <Samex_Comex> Why do they move like that
[4:43:49] <Aydarkzero> never really got into the whole ar thing
[4:43:50] <JailShmixRemix> Pekora's laugh is contagious
[4:44:00] <@TheDropOutDragon> I'm not watching any more of those videos.
[4:44:02] <@TheDropOutDragon> That is fucking sin.
[4:44:10] <+KevinsLunchbox> I wish Marines character was forced to be 17 because it makes the lewd stuff she does super creepy and weird
[4:44:12] <JailShmixRemix> Virtue

[4:45:09] <+SirGO0SE> you're one bad dragon uwu
[4:45:10] <terminusterminal> It's the Dragon Slayer from Berserk but it's vtubers
[4:45:16] <conchubar11> What if we got some WH40K hololive youtubers
[4:45:27] <JailShmixRemix> Holo live also has guy vtubers
[4:45:30] <conchubar11> I could watch some space marines game for a bit
[4:45:39] <ahaegotrigger> Nice
[4:45:41] <laserbeaming> I could get into 40K VTubers
[4:45:43] <YakumoYomi> Holostars doesn't get enough love.
[4:45:45] <@TheDropOutDragon> I've never been a fan of webcams that are just potato in the corner. And what would virtual 'dod' be but just that? A slightly animated furry that stares forward and shifts his weight, and sometimes his mouth glitches. Is that gimmick enough for people?
[4:45:59] <shinichizio> Literally yes.
[4:46:07] <@TheDropOutDragon> I'll go on living, without a webcam for now. Or a virtual character.
[4:46:07] <JailShmixRemix> Yes
[4:46:33] <laserbeaming> weren't you going to stop after the last level? Not complaining
[4:46:38] <@TheDropOutDragon> DoD will remain, badly drawn, and not watched a lot.
[4:46:59] <Nomenanza> on text? yes
[4:47:00] <ahaegotrigger> yes
[4:47:01] <Schlongalong> i like the ones where they turn themselves into a talking hamburger or a raccoon
[4:47:19] <Nomenanza> Gotta explain to dem kids what the blue stuff is
[4:47:22] <JailShmixRemix> I like the shiba one
[4:47:29] <laserbeaming> the other one is insulated
[4:47:44] <conchubar11> no momentum, rockets
[4:47:48] <avatar_beifong_v2> They look like TMNT villains
[4:47:55] <@TheDropOutDragon> Korn sucks.
[4:47:58] <bazz_tv> No ramps in this level
[4:48:02] <%bettysharkface> They kinda remind me of the Monstars from Space Jame
[4:48:11] <CyberDingus> Life sucks.
[4:48:13] <@TheDropOutDragon> Doesn't take much to sell insurance.
[4:48:15] <Nomenanza> sales do bring a lot of money if you can talk to people well
[4:48:16] <@TheDropOutDragon> I know from experience.
[4:48:19] <ahaegotrigger> well he sells insurance how hard could it be
[4:48:23] <bazz_tv> Those chest require explosives
[4:48:23] <@TheDropOutDragon> But it is the devils work, and I don't have that in me.
[4:48:25] <JonnyJug> You can go far if you don't have shame
[4:48:27] <+jiggy_snipe> charisma gets you far
[4:48:31] <YakumoYomi> You don't have to be smart to make money. Just smarter than someone else, I guess.
[4:48:45] <Nomenanza> why is this one specifically lying in the fuck me pose
[4:48:46] <peachy996> I can think of suckier bands
[4:48:47] <chowdah101> fat?
[4:48:48] <+SirGO0SE> ive found korn mostly terrible but they have a few bangers
[4:48:50] <+jiggy_snipe> Bayou Dragons

[4:50:02] <KaiserMario> It's a room full of green
