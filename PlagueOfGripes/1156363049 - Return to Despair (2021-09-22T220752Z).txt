[1:00:54] <%cosmicleviathan18> weird conversation LUL
[1:01:00] <%Johnmaddened> where da video games
[1:01:02] <%Murphio_GS> Gamer girl
[1:01:05] <+sonofthedeepsouth> ah physical media
[1:01:09] <+sonofthedeepsouth> I miss thee
[1:01:12] <+sonofthedeepsouth> TRUE
[1:01:30] <TheAntiNihilist> this is true even in danganronpa. Monokuma was popular for a while and then Junko completely eclipsed his recognizability
[1:01:38] <Daxalog> An image song or character song is a song on a tie-in single or album (often called an image album or character album) for an anime, game, dorama, manga, or commercial product that is sometimes sung by the voice actor or actor of a character, in character with backing vocals.
[1:01:47] <%cosmicleviathan18> YO WE FOUND HIS MIX TAPES
[1:02:28] <quinndan> Oh, like those albums of Hetalia characters singing different songs
[1:02:31] <%Murphio_GS> The question is: Are they fire tho?
[1:02:36] <cap_bon> so which idiot is dying off screen why he fuck around with merch
[1:02:43] <Daxalog> Keep in mind the game was released in 2012.
[1:03:04] <+lordericter> OBS just gotta chug for a bit
[1:03:44] <%cosmicleviathan18> @cap_bon I was thinking the same thing bo8Bsmug
[1:04:18] <+lordericter> I assume its like how vtubers do songs under alias and the agency markets them.  The studio who did the anime likely handles it.
[1:04:21] <%Johnmaddened> is this a
[1:04:27] <%Murphio_GS> Oh,... cool,... jojo reference
[1:04:39] <%Murphio_GS> so funny
[1:04:39] <acridpaladin> its a shame you cant jam that rabbit into a woodchipper
[1:04:51] <rittergeist> Haha, it made a reference to the manga about physically fit homosexual men.
[1:06:10] <%Mizaiya> got this animation is weird
[1:06:15] <%Mizaiya> it reminds me of old flash games
[1:06:42] <franctastic_> i remember this case being kind of interesting, then again its benn bit a minute since i last played it so...
[1:07:32] <cap_bon> with how good the main guy is at solving murder you'd think everyone ewould give up on it by now
[1:07:39] <+lordericter> its kinda just Chiaki and muscle girl
[1:07:56] <Daxalog> Who was the murderer of the last trail?
[1:08:31] <SuperVaderMan> that one guy no one cared about
[1:09:08] <%Murphio_GS> Three way? Oh my
[1:09:33] <Solokaldaka> I love plague vs dungeon grandpa
[1:09:57] <SuperVaderMan> Nagito's only friend is ol' Righty
[1:10:00] <cap_bon> Can we just tie this idiot to a chair somewhere so he cant fuck things up
[1:10:43] <Solokaldaka> we tried that once and the damn bear let him out
[1:11:01] <biomegabear> Is part 1 of this stream on twitch?
[1:11:08] <+lordericter> I like mobster more than the fortune teller in game one but yeah these other 2 suck
[1:11:10] <Daxalog> OH. Mr sharp teeth?
[1:11:30] <Eger007> you'll know
[1:11:32] <Daxalog> They were breed to survive.
[1:11:39] <%Murphio_GS> they've gone out to the wild
[1:11:39] <cap_bon> they were left in the savanna where he died I assume
[1:11:49] <SuperVaderMan> Akane ate them. They never 'did' specify what the group was eating start of stream

[1:14:12] <+lordericter> oh that expression was neat
[1:14:27] <BR0Speedwagon> iirc everyone found a file talking a bit about the events of the first game, but it didn't explicitly say that it was an imposter.

[1:54:46] <xeros720> to add a perverted angle and they do it with panties
[1:54:48] <Solokaldaka> I think it is meant to represent "Panty Bandit"
[1:55:21] <dds333a> LUL LUL
[1:55:25] <LegendCasqueD> Has Chiaki ever beaten Christopher Robin?
[1:55:47] <+Tr1pkT12> Chiaki bunny girl
[1:56:41] <dds333a> it's so bad
[1:57:07] <+legioned247> WHY Eli you hate this but at the same time you wish to destroy it with logic
[1:57:57] <+XTremeXMen> I love her yawn
[1:58:04] <SuperVaderMan> none of these 3 answers are gamer answers
[1:58:19] <+legioned247> you make me want to put a hat on a cat
[1:58:26] <paltar4> Not the park gamers hate the outside world
[1:58:42] <+Damie904> You can learn a lot about someone by going to the supermarket together tbh
[1:58:43] <Solokaldaka> enigmaOld katesOld I hate doing things
[1:59:23] <+legioned247> not going lie eli I seen and randomly say the blood when having my blood drawn at the doctor

[2:00:09] <+legioned247> white day

[2:01:32] <Solokaldaka> true enigmaLUL quebLUL and we get farther from the answer the more progress we make
[2:02:01] <%Murphio_GS> Murder date
[2:02:10] <+legioned247> but also the blood this is a blood bank sir
[2:02:11] <SuperVaderMan> I can't believe that it's possible to kinda have fun in Danganronpa 2
[2:02:44] <Samex_Comex> Ew hand guy
[2:03:07] <paltar4> Terry crews was playing this game on twitch with his son like a month ago
[2:03:09] <SuperVaderMan> The toilet's right behind him, Hajime. It'd be so easy to give him a swirly...
[2:03:32] <+legioned247> lol
[2:03:52] <Dlent_> Nagito seems clever :)
[2:04:12] <xeros720> hmm, the classic depiction of thieves in japanese media actually come the 1600s
[2:04:28] <Samex_Comex> My hand likes it when I ramble
[2:04:44] <franctastic_> it makes me HOPE Kreygasm
[2:05:12] <franctastic_> lucky bastard
[2:05:15] <Samex_Comex> Brake his neck!
[2:05:18] <xeros720> the plan is to kick his ass
[2:05:26] <+lordericter> this is a stupid plan
[2:05:27] <SuperVaderMan> just grab him like a greased pig, before he can escape
[2:05:46] <+lordericter> A pose baby
[2:05:51] <franctastic_> Kreygasm
[2:05:52] <Samex_Comex> It's my turn to be choked

[2:07:26] <franctastic_> nah he planned it dont worry
[2:07:27] <$Cobra743> literal plot armor
[2:07:29] <LegendCasqueD> He knew to brace against it?
[2:07:32] <TheAntiNihilist> NAGITO TIME STARTS NOW!!!
[2:07:33] <lemoan> holy shit
[2:07:41] <SuperVaderMan> It's a good thing Akane didn't grab him closer to the bomb
[2:07:42] <Samex_Comex> The power of hope
[2:07:43] <paltar4> Ear drums  punctured
[2:07:59] <franctastic_> IMGOING TO H O P E Kreygasm Kreygasm Kreygasm
[2:08:17] <SuperVaderMan> Just blow up the whole island 4Head
[2:08:31] <franctastic_> Ill H O P E all over the island
[2:09:02] <$Cobra743> i cant beat you with logic so ill just DESTROY IT ALL. and also explain my evil plan so you can stop it. as is the rules of anime
[2:09:43] <paltar4> IS YOU
[2:09:51] <SuperVaderMan> why two whole days
[2:10:40] <cap_bon> Stop critiquing the game or it will get dumber out of spite
[2:10:43] <$Cobra743> big enough to destroy Hawaii? Japan? The Philipenes?
[2:10:45] <franctastic_> Kreygasm
[2:10:47] <SuperVaderMan> Wall is very pretty
[2:10:59] <+lordericter> I got dibs on Chiaki then
[2:11:03] <%Explodincatz> how can u calculate that?
[2:11:31] <Skeletonmanners> literally scrappy doo
[2:11:34] <cap_bon> is it wearing a diaper
[2:11:50] <lemoan> @cap_bon yea
[2:12:26] <cap_bon> tomatoSN
[2:13:08] <cap_bon> can we just grab this guy and fuck him up until he tells us were the bomb is
[2:13:09] <LegendCasqueD> Question - Why didn't they just make Nagito put the code in to the secret door?
[2:13:10] <franctastic_> i like the idea of "luck" as a power
[2:13:35] <TheAntiNihilist> Nagito is too alpha for Japan
[2:13:39] <Samex_Comex> The ultimate weenie
[2:13:50] <LegendCasqueD> Either he'll get lucky and just guess it, or he'll get lucky and not get shredded by the machine gun.
[2:14:03] <$Cobra743> i vote to leave the island
[2:14:29] <lemoan> Can someone explain why this traitor thing even matters?
[2:14:57] <SuperVaderMan> And nothing of value was learned
[2:15:15] <LegendCasqueD> Saying that Monokuma Theater is not funny or interesting, I feel, sets the incorrect expectation that Monokuma is itself funny and/or interesting.
[2:15:15] <lemoan> @SuperVaderMan but our time was lost
[2:15:24] <Dlent_> Theyâ€™re supposed to fill you with despair.
[2:15:29] <Dlent_> I think.
[2:16:07] <Dlent_> Imagine being put in a clockwork orange machine with just Monokuma Theater
[2:16:22] <Samex_Comex> Drowned in shit
[2:16:33] <Daxalog> this is the second shit drowning
[2:16:45] <SuperVaderMan> died shitting, it's how nekomaru would've wanted to go
[2:16:46] <Solokaldaka> guess we gota kill another one
[2:17:08] <lemoan> Mmmmmmm Akane dumps
[2:17:34] <Dlent_> Monster shits was Nekomaruâ€™s gimmick
[2:19:31] <$Cobra743> tackle him right now
[2:19:53] <lemoan> I'm betting sonia or chiaki
[2:20:24] <+legioned247> it your wife
[2:20:27] <bippityjones> I'm enjoying all these guesses
[2:20:54] <$Cobra743> can you filet somone and have them live?
[2:21:17] <%Murphio_GS> or it goes all the way up her neck
[2:22:05] <ratatoing1943_2> so hot
[2:22:12] <lemoan> maybe monokuma gave it to him or something
[2:22:14] <+legioned247> that a pretty powerful bonb
[2:22:18] <+legioned247> bombs
[2:22:20] <LegendCasqueD> :)
[2:22:26] <ratatoing1943_2> Id do both girls
[2:22:42] <ratatoing1943_2> the one in her hoody to
[2:23:27] <+legioned247> Eli pokemon video made me look up what the hartness test was
[2:23:45] <ratatoing1943_2> Is this a porno game?
[2:24:13] <ratatoing1943_2> I hope so
[2:24:30] <lemoan> @ratatoing1943_2 then prepare for disappointment
[2:24:41] <ratatoing1943_2> oh man
[2:24:49] <ratatoing1943_2> Why are you a purple cat?
[2:24:49] <Samex_Comex> Little robot clock?
[2:25:23] <bippityjones> You can't just ask someone why they're a purple cat
[2:25:36] <+legioned247> it interesting that the hartness test and the tuning test have to be done at the same time if it a robot
[2:25:48] <ratatoing1943_2> I think you made some funny dark souls parodys back in the day
[2:26:20] <ratatoing1943_2> purple linx
[2:26:23] <$Cobra743> Berrus?
[2:26:28] <N8r_Tot> VoHiYo
[2:26:32] <Dlent_> Sakura definitely could have done it before monokuma made the rule, if she wanted to.
[2:26:38] <+legioned247> it look like a links
[2:26:46] <+legioned247> I like it
[2:26:50] <ratatoing1943_2> jinx reload
[2:26:56] <%Murphio_GS> it's spelt lynx btw
[2:26:59] <%Murphio_GS> not links
[2:27:09] <+legioned247> your right
[2:27:17] <+legioned247> Lynx
[2:27:34] <lemoan> Oh BOY I love red herrings
[2:27:43] <vizardrob> >trouser snake
[2:27:48] <bippityjones> Hey what about that rule about not destroying island property?
[2:27:51] <Samex_Comex> Give it a good tug
[2:28:05] <$Cobra743> what ARE the rules again?
[2:28:06] <%HawkGoggles2> Trousersnakes are dangerous
[2:28:52] <+legioned247> I feel eli more like a Manu or Pallas cat
[2:29:10] <ratatoing1943_2> I like Sonia, Im gonna open another window on rule 34
[2:29:37] <+legioned247> elii have you ever seen a Pallas cat
[2:29:45] <SuperVaderMan> angled Chiaki is funny
[2:29:51] <bippityjones> pawbs
[2:30:02] <Dlent_> This stream sponsored by Linksys
[2:30:09] <ratatoing1943_2> Also Hinata
[2:30:15] <ratatoing1943_2> and Nanami
[2:30:29] <%Murphio_GS> bird furry
[2:30:47] <+legioned247> there the like the physical manafatstion of cat rage
[2:30:48] <%Murphio_GS> owlcats are like owlbears
[2:30:51] <%Murphio_GS> but cats
[2:31:06] <ratatoing1943_2> And specially the tan one
[2:31:15] <bippityjones> It's hard to translate a " :3 " with a beak
[2:31:15] <LegendCasqueD> Fun fact - Most owls can turn their heads 270 degrees in both directions. The owl in Winnie the Pooh's Home Run Derby can fuck itself in all directions.
[2:31:24] <ratatoing1943_2> thre dildos
[2:31:26] <$Cobra743> Sphinx but with lynx base, owl wings, and Akane's face
[2:31:26] <+legioned247> the Pallas is the angerest cat in the world
[2:31:30] <%Murphio_GS> Nordic?
[2:31:32] <%Murphio_GS> what
[2:31:36] <ratatoing1943_2> choose a dildo
[2:31:36] <lemoan> nordic?
[2:31:54] <%Murphio_GS> They just made that up
[2:31:55] <ratatoing1943_2> dont look nordic at all
[2:32:13] <+legioned247> owl lynx hybrid would be a cool as monster hunter monster
[2:32:22] <@Nightbot> Plague is a youtube animator and also streams at https://picarto.tv/Plague . Also: t-shirts! http://goo.gl/lze8QO
[2:32:23] <ratatoing1943_2> Just get a gun
[2:32:56] <bippityjones> Sonia had to take on horny double duty after nurse girl died
[2:32:59] <ratatoing1943_2> I hope the dudes die first
[2:33:28] <lemoan> @ratatoing1943_2 oh you are very late. most of the females have died
[2:33:35] <ratatoing1943_2> frick
[2:33:48] <ratatoing1943_2> I think we all know what the password says...
[2:33:52] <%Murphio_GS> akane is the best though
[2:34:14] <ratatoing1943_2> It has six letters
[2:34:43] <+legioned247> lol
[2:34:53] <cap_bon> even in death he stil pleases
[2:35:00] <Samex_Comex> Nekomaru is alive, again?
[2:35:05] <%Murphio_GS> ancient?
[2:35:05] <$Cobra743> most important question Plague...will the new model keep the hat?
[2:35:09] <ratatoing1943_2> Im hard
[2:35:12] <%Murphio_GS> it looks really modern
[2:35:49] <%Murphio_GS> especially with the english used sideby side with greek pillars
[2:35:51] <+lordericter> if it was engraving that could work
[2:35:56] <%Murphio_GS> and then the checkered floor
[2:36:08] <cap_bon> are there even anymore trials at this point it feels kinda end game at this point
[2:36:12] <+lordericter> but if it was just painted or embedded then its not possible
[2:37:20] <cap_bon> let her snap his dick off who cares
[2:37:27] <+legioned247> I wonder what the dominanting characteristic would it be the lynx or the owl ðŸ¦‰ also I like to see what an owl body would look with lynx characteristic and a lynx body with owl characteristic
[2:37:57] <+legioned247> I really picture a monster hunter monster
[2:38:28] <+legioned247> cat body with feathers
[2:38:44] <cap_bon> for some reason im imagining something taht resembles a harpy owl LUL
[2:38:46] <+legioned247> yeah I can picture it
[2:39:00] <ratatoing1943_2> The biracial bear
[2:39:01] <+legioned247> if I could draw
[2:39:12] <$Cobra743> is Danganronpa one of those series that if it wasn't being inhabited by teenagers that it would fall apart?
[2:39:33] <+legioned247> I do a bird standing owl ðŸ¦‰ pose but with a cat body
[2:39:37] <ratatoing1943_2> and every afternoon
[2:39:37] <cap_bon> super genius teenagers with poor social skills
[2:39:50] <lemoan> @Cobra743 no it would be just as bad. possible worse. the writing is just stupid
[2:40:22] <cap_bon> no please no theater
[2:40:37] <ratatoing1943_2> Its in chinese now
[2:40:46] <+Damie904> Plague, do you think you'll stream DR3? It's terrible but I think it'd be hilarious to shit on.
[2:40:50] <LegendCasqueD> They're poorly written, boring, and stupid because Monokuma is poorly written, boring, and stupid.
[2:41:20] <+legioned247> the closest thing I could think of the thing you thinking of drawing was the owl monster in avatar the last Airbender
[2:41:28] <lemoan> @LegendCasqueD But look at him. Isn't he just so DAMN MARKETABLE!
[2:41:35] <ratatoing1943_2> Is their booba in this game?
[2:41:43] <%Murphio_GS> Maybe he's hungry
[2:41:56] <franctastic_> ultra despair girls tho
[2:42:08] <+Mekhet09> I don't know how this would make you feel but I was doing the Samurai class character quest. They had to go into a brothel and I just heard it in you voice "Okay Warrior of LIght, we have to go to the whorehouse fast."
[2:42:13] <bippityjones> DR3 is pretty good imo, on par or better than DR3
[2:42:18] <%Johnmaddened> v3 is really polarizing
[2:42:26] <%Johnmaddened> yeah pretty much
[2:42:27] <bippityjones> wait no, dr2
[2:42:35] <sosuke5> As far as I can tell, DRV3 is the best overall
[2:42:47] <ratatoing1943_2> they play it because of the pussy, at least I know I will
[2:42:58] <+Damie904> It's less not giving a shit and more, them shitting on the series over all and going meta at times.
[2:43:05] <+Damie904> Sometimes it works, sometimes it really doesnt
[2:43:05] <cap_bon> Is the devs being spiteful the same as not giving a shit
[2:43:16] <Skeletonmanners> style over substance but the style isnt that strong
[2:43:16] <ratatoing1943_2> HOT
[2:43:17] <+Mekhet09> That's my problem.
[2:43:23] <bippityjones> I just like some of the music
[2:43:26] <lemoan> YEAH
[2:43:26] <franctastic_> GOD I WISH THAT WAS ME
[2:43:27] <lemoan> KILL HIM
[2:43:29] <Samex_Comex> Where are the 4 dark devas of destruction?
[2:43:32] <ratatoing1943_2> I can think of some bombs I can see
[2:43:33] <+lordericter> Nagito is getting off
[2:43:34] <%Johnmaddened> he's into it
[2:43:34] <%Murphio_GS> He's into it
[2:43:36] <+legioned247> choke me harder mommy
[2:43:39] <Dlent_> Kill :)
[2:43:45] <LegendCasqueD> DRV3 doesn't really have a Sakura or Akane.
[2:43:46] <lemoan> YYYEEEEEAAAAAHHHH GO HCOKE HIM HARDER
[2:43:46] <%Murphio_GS> I don't blame him tho
[2:43:47] <%HawkGoggles2> "hurt me mommy"
[2:43:51] <lemoan> GO AKANE GO
[2:43:53] <$Cobra743> break each finger one by one joint by joint
[2:44:11] <cap_bon> A murder mystery type game like this were your choices acutal determine who lives and dies would be interesting
[2:44:11] <+legioned247> choke boner
[2:44:13] <franctastic_> H O P E ME HARDER Kreygasm
[2:44:21] <LegendCasqueD> @cap_bon But also a motherfucker to write.
[2:44:29] <lemoan> @franctastic_ careful he's about to hope all over the floor
[2:44:43] <cap_bon> truuue
[2:44:47] <LegendCasqueD> Chucky did big slap.
[2:44:50] <franctastic_> hot
[2:45:05] <+legioned247> now kiss kiss nice
[2:45:06] <ratatoing1943_2> I though she slaped her ass for a moment
[2:45:12] <+lordericter> minkyeThinkye
[2:45:13] <ratatoing1943_2> Do the dirl scissor?
[2:45:15] <lemoan> What? Doens't she always want to fight?
[2:45:27] <Samex_Comex> The shrine is still there
[2:45:40] <+legioned247> if this guy get up with a raging boner
[2:45:56] <franctastic_> NotLikeThis
[2:45:56] <ratatoing1943_2> The dudes design are terrible and generic, girls look cool tho
[2:46:07] <lemoan> @legioned247 you just can't see it but it's there
[2:46:24] <ratatoing1943_2> CORRECT
[2:46:27] <+Mekhet09> I wan to see the cute boys.
[2:46:29] <+legioned247> lol
[2:47:22] <+legioned247> it not murder eli if he can still talk while your choking them
[2:47:25] <+lordericter> I like seeing all the cuties, but the twinks in this game are shitty so I appreciate the focus on Chiaki and the girls
[2:47:26] <ratatoing1943_2> I hate the lil peep looking fucker
[2:47:57] <lemoan> I miss Nekomaru
[2:48:20] <franctastic_> H O P E THO
[2:48:24] <ratatoing1943_2> dumb anime plot, dont bother
[2:48:30] <franctastic_> Kreygasm
[2:49:01] <ratatoing1943_2> Do the girls show their ass?
[2:49:28] <SuperVaderMan> Let's split up gang :)
[2:51:00] <Dlent_> Hajimeâ€™s lanky run is still funny looking
[2:51:19] <ratatoing1943_2> virgin run
[2:51:22] <+tiredcacti> why are his legs so long
[2:51:47] <Dlent_> Theyâ€™re sparing you from the blinding funhouse
[2:52:12] <ratatoing1943_2> Do the girls poo in the game?
[2:52:36] <@Nightbot> Plague is a youtube animator and also streams at https://picarto.tv/Plague . Also: t-shirts! http://goo.gl/lze8QO
[2:52:37] <bippityjones> I know they do in DR3
[2:52:44] <+tiredcacti> they're actually all constipated
[2:52:45] <SuperVaderMan> Searched the whole castle, all done :)
[2:52:46] <ratatoing1943_2> Do they show it?
[2:52:57] <lemoan> @Garry_Guyface go on...
[2:53:13] <ratatoing1943_2> ow yeah, huge poos
[2:53:15] <Dlent_> Peko being stuck in the bathroom with the shits was a plot point in an earlier case
[2:53:16] <LegendCasqueD> Peko having indigestion was a critical point of the first case.
[2:53:20] <bippityjones> @lemoan it's a plot-point
[2:53:28] <bippityjones> kind of
[2:53:39] <LegendCasqueD> @Dlent_ I hate that two of us brought that up at basically the same time.
[2:53:48] <ratatoing1943_2> They are so cute, but they poo horrible poos, so hot
[2:54:16] <lemoan> @Garry_Guyface Somehow that "toilet clogging bitch" line is relevant
[2:54:52] <ratatoing1943_2> Nanami can drop a got log on me
[2:55:24] <ratatoing1943_2> also Sonia
[2:55:31] <ratatoing1943_2> And the tan girl
[2:55:44] <SuperVaderMan> monokuma's number is just so big
[2:56:01] <ratatoing1943_2> wtf is the deal with the bears
[2:56:06] <ratatoing1943_2> are they live?
[2:56:39] <%Murphio_GS> More annoying sounds
[2:56:56] <ratatoing1943_2> clicking A, the game
[2:57:02] <LegendCasqueD> Because it's a trashy visual novel.
[2:57:05] <ratatoing1943_2> wtf
[2:57:11] <ratatoing1943_2> Japan, man
[2:57:34] <bippityjones> There are definitely swaths of this game that feel written by middle-aged Japanese men channeling Bevis & Butthead
[2:57:58] <lemoan> OIH GOD NOT BOTH OF THEM
[2:58:03] <ratatoing1943_2> Nanami can poo on her hand and give me a blowjob, I wouldnt complain
[2:58:39] <Jjaz_R> modcheck?
[2:58:47] <SuperVaderMan> I liked plague's answer of the funhouse weapon room being where Nagito hid the bombs better
[2:58:54] <lemoan> @Jjaz_R we got mods?
[3:00:22] <ratatoing1943_2> I want Nanami to poo on her hand and give me a handjob
[3:00:31] <Jjaz_R> @lemoan That's what I'm asking. ratato is being pretty creepy.
[3:01:09] <lemoan> @Jjaz_R I don't think plague has any
[3:01:11] <%Murphio_GS> A box without hinges, key or lid, Yet golden treasure inside is hid.
[3:02:15] <cap_bon> its not like you use tags so bots are gonna find you
[3:02:20] <ratatoing1943_2> I want to raw hot dog Nanami on her yoga pants
[3:03:06] <Dlent_> Thatâ€™s seems like a porting issue.
[3:03:11] <ratatoing1943_2> Right after she works out for hours
[3:03:13] <Dlent_> Donâ€™t remember that on the vita.
[3:04:50] <Dlent_> Thereâ€™s a button you can hold to speed up movement on the map.
[3:04:57] <Dlent_> No idea which one.
[3:05:10] <LegendCasqueD> There's a button you can press to just snap to places on these screens.
[3:06:43] <Dlent_> Akane will fight the bombs
[3:06:48] <LegendCasqueD> :)
[3:07:58] <+Damie904> Pipe bombs?
[3:08:01] <Jjaz_R> @ratatoing1943_2 Please stop.
[3:08:19] <cap_bon> oh look its the metal slug truck
[3:08:30] <lemoan> @Jjaz_R He's just trolling at this point. Just ignore him and wait for plague to ban him.
[3:08:39] <Dlent_> I feel like the ultimate mechanic should be able to disarm bombs.
[3:09:39] <Earlymanchan> kek
[3:10:17] <bippityjones> lol, lmao even
[3:10:26] <Skeletonmanners> rotfl perhaps
[3:10:57] <LegendCasqueD> Supermarket, I guess?
[3:11:17] <%Bigchill___> is she gonna get pulled over?
[3:11:20] <+lordericter> this is ludicrous
[3:11:21] <CrimsonFox777> You know, I wouldn't think welding around gas would be a smart idea.
[3:11:50] <LegendCasqueD> @CrimsonFox777 Just get lucky. :)
[3:12:01] <SuperVaderMan> Oh well, it can't be helped :)
[3:13:12] <%Bigchill___> lol. do they usually spin like that?
[3:14:45] <cap_bon> how would he even set that up
[3:15:12] <SuperVaderMan> Nagito just slapped his hands on the keyboard to program this. He just got lucky that it worked
[3:15:18] <lemoan> @cap_bon plot contrivance
[3:15:54] <%Explodincatz> Nagito can fix Skyrim
[3:15:54] <Jjaz_R> Why does it even matter who the "traitor" is? Does the game ever even say what the traitor is doing to the rest of the group?
[3:16:13] <Dlent_> Vaguely
[3:18:39] <SuperVaderMan> I mean, fireworks are still dangerous in that quantity
[3:20:40] <lemoan> God the dialogue is so fucking padded in this game
[3:21:29] <%Johnmaddened> here we go
[3:21:47] <+lordericter> what's with the fucking church choir
[3:22:58] <lemoan> trash cans
[3:23:19] <lemoan> I can see that
[3:23:22] <%Bigchill___> I do
[3:23:32] <lemoan> The Mr. Men SHow?
[3:23:33] <%Bigchill___> They also remade it later
[3:23:52] <Skeletonmanners> looks like a bird cookie
[3:24:01] <+lordericter> yeah those are real
[3:24:11] <LegendCasqueD> When I was a little baby person the school I went to had one of those that was censored by... somebody.
[3:24:14] <+legioned247> are you winning cat father
[3:24:55] <+legioned247> I mean
[3:24:59] <SquigglyLizard> so why are they putting the random fire out?
[3:25:02] <+legioned247> lok
[3:25:07] <+lordericter> oh if its a chemical fire they are fucked
[3:25:23] <+legioned247> pee the fire out
[3:25:57] <+lordericter> wait is Hajime voiced by Johnny Young Bosh?
[3:26:01] <+legioned247> I didn't know that eli
[3:26:14] <cap_bon> Sprinkler water is fucking rank
[3:26:24] <cap_bon> that water just sits in the pipes for years
[3:27:12] <Dlent_> Wow, another monokuma theater. Thanks :)
[3:28:04] <Samex_Comex> The ERSB needs to put too much rambling on the rating
[3:28:11] <+elderpunch> oh shit part 5
[3:29:06] <+Mekhet09> I think the problem is entirely gameplay contrivance.
[3:29:08] <Eightgutter> they're like 15 tbf
[3:29:20] <+Mekhet09> If everyone pointed out everything you'd have nothing to do.
[3:29:24] <+Beno113> Such delicious despair
[3:29:26] <Dlent_> Theyâ€™re supposed to be ultimates.
[3:29:34] <+elderpunch> any character stand out to you in particular??
[3:29:51] <+legioned247> no eli it is the children who are wrong
[3:29:54] <lemoan> @elderpunch Obviously his wife
[3:29:56] <cap_bon> If they came across a murder that wasnt some weird rube goldberg machine kill they would have all died by npow
[3:30:02] <+Mekhet09> I don't know if plague was the one who said this but DR 2 is just DR1 without the smart people.
[3:30:17] <bippityjones> hoo wee
[3:30:26] <Samex_Comex> Ooooh that smell, can't you smell that smell
[3:30:28] <lemoan> YYYYEEEEEEAAAAAHHHHH

[3:30:52] <cap_bon> Finally
[3:31:03] <lemoan> Pretty brutal way to go
[3:31:04] <Jjaz_R> I'm so glad he's dead.
[3:31:04] <Samex_Comex> Party time!
[3:31:05] <+legioned247> problem solved
[3:31:15] <+Beno113> Maybe he's merely pretending
[3:31:18] <+lordericter> oh no your best friend is dead
[3:31:31] <Skeletonmanners> inb4 HA it was my 3rd removed brother in law not me
[3:31:32] <franctastic_> he hoped himself to death
[3:31:32] <+legioned247> mystery solved he was a dumb ass
[3:31:49] <cap_bon> quick pulp his head to make suer
[3:31:57] <lemoan> Are you happy or relieved plague?
[3:32:03] <%Explodincatz> oh my god hes a Klingon
[3:32:15] <+TheOverwhelmingShotgun> Oh, the smug asshole died

[3:35:17] <+legioned247> hush money
[3:35:28] <+Mekhet09> 10 thousand is too cheap lol.
[3:35:32] <Samex_Comex> Stopreon
[3:35:38] <cap_bon> For 10 grand a month I will fuck off and live like a hermet
[3:35:41] <franctastic_> SeemsGood
[3:35:45] <+lordericter> the furries could out bid him though
[3:35:45] <%Bigchill___> 10k a month
[3:35:54] <cap_bon> Some Saudi guy tahts like fuck this guy.
[3:35:58] <bippityjones> I can absolutely see a spiteful billionaire who hates art and humanity to the point of spending 10k a month
[3:36:00] <lemoan> 10 thousand way to cheap though
[3:36:15] <franctastic_> catJAM
[3:36:15] <+legioned247> he the CEO of a company is like I hate this guy here 10k never do anything

[3:37:06] <franctastic_> they alwasy go hard for the last investigation theme
[3:37:21] <Samex_Comex> Nagito dying is pretty metal
[3:38:15] <%vizardrob> plagueChirei

[3:38:40] <Skeletonmanners> Rob the Wizz
[3:38:42] <+lordericter> I appreciated how shitty Byakuya was that he convoluted the one open and shut case in the 1st game
[3:38:49] <+legioned247> wizzrobe
[3:38:54] <%Murphio_GS> What if Nagito isn't dead tho
[3:38:56] <+lordericter> Really drove home why the serial killer wanted to fuck him
[3:39:34] <%vehementvadr> the letter v is just an inferior w, that's why you don't acknowledge it as v
[3:39:53] <Ghost_riderr_29> what IS the gameplay of this game tho? all im seeing is endless dialogue scrolling
[3:39:56] <%Murphio_GS> I feel that way about Warcraft
[3:40:04] <+legioned247> she is cute
[3:40:08] <%Bigchill___> shes pretty when shes trying to think
[3:40:49] <+HypnospaceHyena> I'm totally convinced Nagito's caused his own death. He's that special kind of a-hole that would try to screw you over after his death.
[3:41:28] <+legioned247> she looks so dumb in that pose
[3:42:00] <+mrredwednesday> POGGERS
[3:43:01] <lemoan> @Ghost_riderr_29 it's a visual novel "mystery" game so... I lot of dialogue. But there are mini games during the court cases
[3:44:08] <LegendCasqueD> @PlagueOfGripes It's a character driven mystery, not a player driven mystery. It's just how the package is.
[3:44:46] <cap_bon> he would have died super quickly from those theigh wounds
[3:45:22] <Ghost_riderr_29> @lemoan i see..are there any different story outcomes for the decisions you make at least ( if any ) ?
[3:48:02] <lemoan> @Ghost_riderr_29 HA. nah. it's all linear. The most deviation you'll get is if you go on "dates" with characters before they die. Then you get to know a little more about them. Also their underwear.
[3:48:46] <Dlent_> His other hand is also bound
[3:51:16] <Ghost_riderr_29> @lemoan wow ok :D
[3:53:07] <franctastic_> NotLikeThis
[3:54:04] <+HypnospaceHyena> Was there a cause of death listed in the file? Blood loss, stabbing, or the stomach wound. I feel like it's usually listed right away, but this time it just kind of indicated his injuries. I feel like they're leaving it out on purpose. NotLikeThis
[3:55:20] <%akumakid13> akumakid13 subscribed at Tier 1. 
[3:56:01] <LegendCasqueD> If I were to try to draft a riff on this series it would probably be centered around human dysfunction rather than some stupid annoying mascot.
[3:56:37] <%akumakid13> only one
[3:57:07] <Jjaz_R> The writer of this game seems like one of those assholes that thinks he's way more clever than he really is.
[3:57:19] <Samex_Comex> Was he hugging it with his love
[3:57:23] <Dlent_> A chest burster was inside that plushie
[3:57:35] <Nagito_Komaeda_Fan> I came at a bad time, right at Nagito's death
[3:57:58] <lemoan> @Nagito_Komaeda_Fan Sounds like a good time to me

[3:58:45] <LegendCasqueD> @Nagito_Komaeda_Fan Nyee-hee-hee.
[3:58:50] <Nagito_Komaeda_Fan> @lemoan What's so good that my husband is dead /cry
[3:59:05] <franctastic_> OH BOY
[4:00:07] <%Bigchill___> Nyaa~
[4:00:16] <ruschcoil> I liked the hairball more
[4:00:22] <%Bigchill___> why, you're a cat
[4:00:26] <BUDderzIllA> Hearts are organs too.
[4:00:27] <Dlent_> Iâ€™ve never imagined what an organ tastes like, but I will now.
[4:00:37] <lemoan> @Nagito_Komaeda_Fan Cause we aren't very found of him here.
[4:01:15] <LegendCasqueD> I am Bender. Please insert girder.
[4:01:28] <ElectricReset> oooOOOh someone payed attention in class. As I sit here reviewing my anatomy and physiology
[4:01:36] <SanderDCastle> Muscles are organs too
[4:01:42] <ElectricReset> we actually just covered histology and the integumentary system
[4:01:48] <+TheOverwhelmingShotgun> why is the blood purple?
[4:02:09] <lemoan> @TheOverwhelmingShotgun Japanese censorship
[4:02:32] <+TheOverwhelmingShotgun> @lemoan ah, makes sense.
[4:02:33] <%Murphio_GS> How nice of them
[4:04:04] <lemoan> @PlagueOfGripes I think the message nagito left you was prerecorded and he was murdered way before. Then the panels were put there for you to knock over
[4:04:37] <twieetcha> Hey plague, howâ€™s danganronpa 2? Is it way better or way worse than 1?
[4:05:49] <Samex_Comex> Check out the killers killer playlist
[4:06:27] <%Bigchill___> shes getting gangsta on ya
[4:08:10] <+Mekhet09> That delivery.
[4:08:47] <LegendCasqueD> I mean this isn't the first time someone got yeeted by a bomb and lived.
[4:08:49] <Samex_Comex> Weeeeee!
[4:08:51] <%Bigchill___> Her swearing sounds like she's saying angry words she heard mommy say one time.
[4:10:00] <lemoan> @PlagueOfGripes You planning on doing the trial tonight as well or just the investigation?
[4:12:28] <%Mizaiya> JC, A BOMB
[4:15:42] <theloganbrand> They're Japanese. They know what a bomb can do to an island.

[4:23:20] <+Mekhet09> It can be both.
[4:23:37] <Samex_Comex> That Monokuma is so wacky
[4:24:15] <LegendCasqueD> Hey look a stupid bear nobody cares about in the tub to the right.
[4:24:55] <lemoan> I kinda like the dumb diaper rabbit but mainly because everryone keeps making fun of her.
[4:25:43] <franctastic_> cmonBruh
[4:26:30] <LegendCasqueD> I'
[4:26:40] <LegendCasqueD> I'm pretty sure the Funhouse is very specifically split off from the rest of the island.
