[0:05:09] <+PleasantLee> 2001 I think
[0:06:18] <cap_bon> So I never played the original ff7 but I assume it doesnt have time ghosts or characters just shifting voice tone for plot dumps

[0:06:50] <jaypeesan> Which fantasy is the real final one?
[0:06:50] <lizard_wizard_ixalotl> atleast the music is absolutely amazing
[0:06:53] <%KellBeII> its weird to have nostalgia about not being able to play something
[0:07:35] <+PleasantLee> not going to kalm with the ladies?
[0:07:43] <cap_bon> I have no context for that but sure
[0:07:50] <PhilanthropyG> do they always have to tell you game over? harsh.
[0:07:54] <%RykerSkies> i look forward to a comfortable stream grinding for no good reason
[0:08:14] <+PleasantLee> also its good to barret some levels before coral too
[0:08:19] <%Cucamabungabu> gonna grind some shit in destiny 2 while watching your stream.
[0:08:23] <+Mekhet09> dude when I was a kid i used to delete my save file like 7 times because I shut it off while the memory up.
[0:08:52] <%RykerSkies> oh the upscale
[0:09:01] <%octotasty> upscaled backgrounds too I assume
[0:09:23] <normalguycap> My man! Enjoyed your latest video. Thank you for that. Have an internet stranger's best wishes.
[0:09:24] <PhilanthropyG> FF14 wont let me on because of system crashes, so I will spend my  time watching you, magic cat.
[0:09:26] <%boatzndhoez> Did I come just on time :O ?!
[0:09:42] <$JobbedBone> Is it that fancy AI upscaling treatment 9 got? PogChamp

[0:09:51] <+PleasantLee> I love this intro so much
[0:09:53] <jaypeesan> uuuu 60 fps jolly
[0:10:06] <+PleasantLee> the orchestral version is amazing
[0:10:08] <DarkShadowRage> oh good, yeah then the character model swaps should work
[0:10:08] <%boatzndhoez> @normalguycap ''now'' its been a good while
[0:10:20] <DarkShadowRage> you can also get FFNX to get real time lighting and shadows
[0:10:23] <DarkShadowRage> it's pretty rad
[0:10:24] <normalguycap> I didn't grow up with FF7. Mine were Grandia and Legend of Dragoon. Playing through Grandia for the first time since childhood.
[0:10:28] <cap_bon> when do the time ghosts show up tomatoSmile
[0:10:29] <Lopetax3> @boatzndhoez yup!
[0:10:31] <+PleasantLee> hahaha
[0:10:32] <PhilanthropyG> uhhhh
[0:10:34] <netarms> 👻
[0:10:40] <%KellBeII> reminds me of the thing, the intro i mean
[0:10:46] <%octotasty> Those were the time ghosts, infecting your game
[0:10:47] <%RykerSkies> my immersion! plagueBark
[0:10:47] <$JobbedBone> the time ghosts are chat
[0:10:56] <%octotasty> nomura is retroactively corrupting it
[0:11:02] <%boatzndhoez> when do the time ghosts come LUL
[0:11:02] <+PleasantLee> bubuabuuuuhbuuuubabuuu
[0:11:06] <jaypeesan> these 90s graphics are such a throwback...love it!
[0:11:09] <$JobbedBone> peering into the past, sapping energy from it
[0:11:13] <Janzer_> el gato
[0:11:16] <netarms> mind blowing 25 years ago
[0:11:17] <normalguycap> @boatzndhoez Okay cool. All I know is that it wasn't there the last time I viewed which I don't think was terribly long ago.
[0:11:26] <+sniffy77> where r the time ghosts
[0:11:26] <PhilanthropyG> I was fighting with my two bros to play this game. 3 save files, all racing to the end
[0:11:30] <%JovianGargoyle> My first was FF8. Suffice to say I didn't get into Final Fantasy again for a long time after that.
[0:11:35] <netarms> the transition from cutscene to gameplay was really impressive
[0:11:43] <netarms> sound is good
[0:11:43] <%boatzndhoez> @normalguycap yeah sometimes he couldnt use it because of a different steam account or something
[0:11:43] <Janzer_> yeah i know a dude that thinks Half-Life 1 was no big deal. "i don't get it"
[0:11:44] <%KellBeII> sounds good so far
[0:11:47] <Coystick> Go now, kill Areith's children
[0:11:56] <itsdasteve> reasonable volume
[0:11:57] <kieranmusic> Audio levels are all good.
[0:11:59] <%daveronald> good
[0:12:00] <+VictorVonLouche> Yeah sounds alright.
[0:12:02] <PhilanthropyG> Go make a soulnado
[0:12:02] <normalguycap> Fine to me!
[0:12:07] <%boatzndhoez> sounds okay atm
[0:12:08] <%lirugeda> sounds good!
[0:12:10] <+PleasantLee> I was talking to a friend about this earlier. he said ff7/8 was the last time he was blown away by graphics in video games. now that everything is looks amazing, nothing sticks out
[0:12:19] <$JobbedBone> etalPumpIt
[0:12:43] <jaypeesan> ex-soldiers were pretty jacked back in the day

[0:14:08] <normalguycap> @JobbedBone good one
[0:14:33] <PhilanthropyG> short pole sounds like the beginning of a fence
[0:14:42] <normalguycap> @boatzndhoez Is that his fursona or something?
[0:14:47] <$JobbedBone> Mako poisoning green
[0:14:48] <Mothraken> it's only real salmon if it's from the salmon valley in france

[0:15:48] <$JobbedBone> Crayfish LUL
[0:15:49] <chuca77> purple squad
[0:15:53] <autumnaleaf> its about making you think youre changing fate
[0:15:54] <%octotasty> it's all about purple
[0:15:58] <%apatheticVigilante> no fate but what we make
[0:15:59] <Janzer_> ew streamer purple
[0:16:03] <PhilanthropyG> Hermit Purple it is
[0:16:08] <%KellBeII> deep purple
[0:16:11] <normalguycap> 90s Ps1 RPGs had their cliches, but they showed great love in tons of other aspects. Playing through Grandia 1 and the NPC dialogue is shockingly good.
[0:16:13] <kes009900> fate is fate, but destiny is destiny.
[0:16:16] <$JobbedBone> purp squad
[0:16:19] <ArashlTempesta> welcome back plague
[0:16:20] <+Mekhet09> god I hate ff7r.
[0:16:20] <%octotasty> how much blue you like in your purple?
[0:16:31] <netarms> this is the real game
[0:16:32] <PhilanthropyG> gotta enjoy your setup before doing a long haul
[0:16:41] <chuca77> because its fun
[0:16:46] <normalguycap> Nioh 2 had an extremely good color slider in it's character creation
[0:16:48] <netarms> perfect ratio
[0:16:48] <%boatzndhoez> plagueTaps
[0:16:56] <tolloponik> even number or else photoshop will yell at you
[0:17:06] <%JovianGargoyle> plaguePaws plaguePaws plaguePaws plaguePaws plaguePaws
[0:17:15] <+PleasantLee> numbers dont matter, only the colour
[0:17:25] <normalguycap> Make it a purple/red to match your fur-sona.
[0:18:01] <%KellBeII> its like a classic gamecube color
[0:18:06] <$JobbedBone> ahh yes, royal puce
[0:18:23] <PhilanthropyG> FF7, but all poly models are replaced with Lalafels.
[0:18:27] <+SonxGokuu> is it the uncompressed music?
[0:18:29] <normalguycap> I saw that Yakuza 0 video with like 20 mods. Looked incredible.
[0:18:38] <normalguycap> That's super blue
[0:18:45] <+PleasantLee> yeah still very blue looking
[0:18:47] <Coystick> Big blue
[0:18:47] <+unsolvedAnomalies> no cmyk smh
[0:18:49] <resinite709> gamecube blue
[0:18:51] <netarms> it looks kinda blue
[0:18:53] <+onebadfalco> not orange enough
[0:18:54] <%octotasty> it looks purple here
[0:18:58] <tolloponik> thats crazy it allows you to go into that much detail on the box color
[0:18:59] <PhilanthropyG> gamecube has an irony to it
[0:19:00] <+PleasantLee> its like the middle is blue but the light edge is purple
[0:19:01] <%ForlornCarton> Purple on my end
[0:19:06] <+turn_tex> it's got shades of blue and purple
[0:19:08] <Nenatab> Looks good to me.
[0:19:09] <$JobbedBone> fancy gradient dithering Kreygasm
[0:19:11] <normalguycap> It's not a big deal to me obviously. Enjoy yourself.
[0:19:31] <%JovianGargoyle> Night light is always on
[0:19:34] <%apatheticVigilante> purple isn't a real color anyways
[0:19:34] <+PleasantLee> our monitors are all perfectly calibrated
[0:19:35] <+Mekhet09> i like 4 different colors on every corner.
[0:19:38] <%Borchmoor> Borchmoor subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 3 months! 
[0:19:39] <autumnaleaf> impossible; 180 people are guranteed to have perfect monitors
[0:19:41] <normalguycap> Purple matches your fursona on my screen haha
[0:19:48] <PhilanthropyG> 'Cloud's outfit' purple.
[0:20:12] <itsdasteve> seeing your vtube avatar right next to the window tricks our eyes into perceiving the window as darker than it really is
[0:20:16] <stfn893> plagueTaps Its game time
[0:20:19] <%octotasty> I like my purples to look like they were extracted from glands in snails
[0:20:29] <+PleasantLee> I hink it looks "ahrange"
[0:20:29] <Coystick> It's a lovely purple in Bluedrag
[0:20:34] <cap_bon> whats plagueSS
[0:20:37] <netarms> mass murderer cloud strife
[0:20:41] <%JovianGargoyle> Very dimetapp.
[0:20:58] <$JobbedBone> my favorite snail is that guy from ff6 who zaps if you hit his shell
[0:21:08] <normalguycap> Everytime I see that sword, I think about it's impact on anime and such things.
[0:21:09] <PhilanthropyG> gyooorrrg
[0:21:10] <Daxalog> So in FF are they actually killing them or just knocking them out?
[0:21:20] <cap_bon> clouds leg be lookin kinda long in that attack pose
[0:21:26] <No3rdImpactPlz> So, in what way did you mod the textures? Are you using the machine-learning upscaled backgrounds?
[0:21:33] <+Ynkubus_> @cap_bon its the Star Siege game logo
[0:21:38] <%Heart0fInk> Yooo this gonna be a full playthrough? plaguePog
[0:21:40] <No3rdImpactPlz> Oh, well there we go
[0:21:48] <%octotasty> @cap_bon that's the logo for Star Siege. An Obscure mech shooter game.
[0:21:53] <+PleasantLee> does the texture mod have a toggle button on it in game?
[0:21:57] <%KellBeII> yeah, the High poly versions of the classic RE gaames have a similar issue
[0:22:00] <+onebadfalco> port sounds right
[0:22:03] <Coystick> N-0b=Nob
[0:22:05] <+Brofisticus> looks clean as hell compared to the tiny JPG backgrounds it shipped with
[0:22:08] <LVL1_Scumbag> Is it a gate or a fence?
[0:22:11] <stfn893> "Upscaled original Hd grafficks"
[0:22:21] <+PleasantLee> but where are the bricks?
[0:22:21] <%RykerSkies> isn't that where you just came from?
[0:22:24] <%apatheticVigilante> what does the lamppost mean?!
[0:22:35] <normalguycap> I miss the pre-rendered backgrounds of games like this and Legend of Dragoon. Surprisingly good.
[0:22:37] <%Borchmoor> riffYeti HahaShrugRight plagueFace HahaShrugLeft riffYeti
[0:22:41] <%boatzndhoez> what is it stopping LUL
[0:23:24] <ralphwiggum16> Heya Plaguers! How's my favorite little kitty cat man?
[0:23:25] <%octotasty> Tentacle Dogs. The most dangerous form of animal based security
[0:23:28] <$JobbedBone> Crossing Gate
[0:23:32] <arkv01> critical deez nuts Kreygasm
[0:23:40] <ralphwiggum16> @arkv01 OOOOOOOOOOH
[0:23:41] <ArashlTempesta> its going to hogwarts
[0:23:47] <PhilanthropyG> the sound of polished blademetal coursing through guard bodies of flesh bone and occasional scraps of metal. "crtclng"
[0:23:52] <+turn_tex> looks like there's a lowered gate nearby
[0:23:58] <ChronoRomancer> there's a walkway on the other side
[0:23:59] <LVL1_Scumbag> Maybe it was meant to be a tunnel at some point?
[0:24:24] <normalguycap> omg I HAAAATTED Wedge in FF7R. The part at chapter 12 when they are dropping the plate.
[0:24:35] <+PleasantLee> maybe gordon the train has been bricked up nearby
[0:24:40] <$JobbedBone> flavored assets LUL
[0:24:44] <normalguycap> The guards tell him no, they won't open the gate and he falls down and gives up.
[0:25:00] <madiethemagepc> how many times hsve you beat this game?
[0:25:09] <cap_bon> Biggs was way to handsome for remake
[0:25:16] <%boatzndhoez> nooooo we get a army according to remake :)
[0:25:25] <normalguycap> Biggs looked like charlie sheen in the remake.
[0:25:30] <%Owkono> the future doesn't exist
[0:25:31] <%apatheticVigilante> Avalanche was destroyed and then reborn under Barret
[0:25:47] <normalguycap> Cirrus
[0:25:50] <PhilanthropyG> Trying to think of what someone could do with a mako reactor-sized hole in the earth spewing mako energy. Someone from a different franchise.
[0:25:51] <smile64> biggs not a ladies man int his universe
[0:25:55] <normalguycap> Nimbo-stratus
[0:26:06] <%Heart0fInk> NO!! Everyone Is In Avalanche! Even President Shrinra Is A Member!!
[0:26:12] <$JobbedBone> square clood
[0:26:28] <netarms> zack was a lot more social
[0:26:30] <%apatheticVigilante> Zach was a goof
[0:26:39] <$JobbedBone> gongaga
[0:26:41] <itsdasteve> "Ah, you are named after a weather phenomenon, you must be a Final Fantasy protagonist"
[0:26:43] <%Owkono> brain damage
[0:26:48] <normalguycap> Zach was fair and cloud is nomura nowadays.
[0:26:51] <Daxalog> Cause SOLDIER's are COOOOOL
[0:26:54] <+Brofisticus> maintaining the stereotype from the vids
[0:27:14] <arkv01> but he don't gotta kiss you
[0:27:27] <ralphwiggum16> Plague, this game was made for 7 year olds.
[0:27:28] <normalguycap> I wish they played up Barret as eco-dad more. That was my favorite bit of FF7R
[0:27:29] <netarms> they cut that line from the remake
[0:27:30] <+FingaLights> Maybe a mix of Zack and Seph
[0:27:31] <%Heart0fInk> WOAH!
[0:27:35] <$JobbedBone> D:
[0:27:36] <%Heart0fInk> That tracking
[0:27:39] <%Traximus_V> plagueFear
[0:27:41] <Daxalog> OH
[0:27:46] <Coystick> CLOUD CAREFUL OF REALITY THERE
[0:27:47] <+PleasantLee> hey barret hire my comatose friend for your deadly mission
[0:27:47] <rotche_yalla> cinematic
[0:28:12] <Daxalog> Engines and Pipes
[0:28:16] <ralphwiggum16> @PleasantLee hahahahahaahahahaah!!!!
[0:28:20] <shinichizio> This pipe is off-limits. VoteNay
[0:28:27] <%Heart0fInk> And I Miss That! It feels like an old ass 80's movie.
[0:28:29] <arkv01> it would look a little messy in unreal unengine, but I'd appreciate it
[0:28:29] <cap_bon> the art of filling stages with garbage is hard
[0:28:30] <Daxalog> Engines and Engines and processors and engines
[0:28:39] <%Heart0fInk> all this game is missing is actual ass rats
[0:28:42] <Julkson> Bureaucracy. They were given money to build infrastructure, and they didn't care where they put it
[0:28:46] <%KellBeII> this is supposed to be a train station where they move a bunch of cargo yeah?  there should be shit littered everywhere
[0:29:02] <$JobbedBone> "we were contracted to put 50 crossing gates in, and they're going in"
[0:29:04] <arkv01> he big
[0:29:07] <arkv01> big sword
[0:29:10] <ralphwiggum16> He's a cool huge guy.
[0:29:29] <ralphwiggum16> Heya Kell! How's my favorite bunny man?
[0:29:33] <arkv01> damn these are some crisp ass textures
[0:29:35] <normalguycap> Is that lamppost on dirt?
[0:29:38] <redguyx85> a load bearing wall?
[0:29:44] <$JobbedBone> trippy
[0:29:49] <normalguycap> that shadow was a fun observation
[0:29:51] <+PleasantLee> mako energy lightbulbs m'boy
[0:29:53] <ralphwiggum16> Actually, Frank from Donnie Darko is probably my favorite bunny man.
[0:29:55] <arkv01> wedge says SURPRISE SQUIDS
[0:29:57] <Down10_> Hello Plague
[0:30:09] <$JobbedBone> its a hard-light post
[0:30:26] <+easilykillablejeff> There's a character model mod on nexusmods that has redone chibi models. It's not 100% done for all models in the game, but it looks great.
[0:30:41] <arkv01> thank you for securing the escape route with your dumptruck ass wedge
[0:30:43] <%Heart0fInk> Man this plate thing is WAY fuckin high up.
[0:30:50] <redguyx85> sounds better then squal
[0:30:51] <cloakdank> Lost all respect for you for trying to use your dad's pain for Twitter clout. You're disgusting.
[0:31:04] <arkv01> jesus christ
[0:31:05] <redguyx85> than*
[0:31:13] <%Heart0fInk> could be a garbage furnace.
[0:31:19] <ArashlTempesta> oh god he has headphones on he cant hear us
[0:31:26] <$JobbedBone> does that imply this place used to run on coal?
[0:31:38] <arkv01> oooh those reactor walls don't look too good though...
[0:31:40] <%boatzndhoez> @cloakdank LUL shut up dude
[0:31:41] <%Heart0fInk> @cloakdank YIKES
[0:31:56] <cloakdank> "My dads intestines ruptured from covid even though it's only in 3.2% of cases."
[0:31:59] <PhilanthropyG> ladders like that make me sweat for my mortality.
[0:32:00] <$JobbedBone> thats where Newt lives
[0:32:01] <cap_bon> that perspective shift is werid
[0:32:08] <Down10_> sloppy work, Square
[0:32:20] <+PleasantLee> weird glass floor to look at the pipes
[0:32:24] <%lirugeda> is the music different? I can't tell
[0:32:25] <%boatzndhoez> No mods? plagueFear
[0:32:25] <normalguycap> @cloakdank That's nothing compare to LittleVMills 7 months after his mom's death.
[0:32:26] <%Thornathis> @cloakdank imagine letting someone's twitter post live rent free in your head
[0:32:59] <arkv01> same, apparently covid fucks up your organs if given the chance
[0:33:15] <%RykerSkies> @lirugeda different sounfont i think
[0:33:31] <%lirugeda> ah ok; thanks
[0:33:45] <cloakdank> I can at least say the last memories of my dad won't be me flexing for clout on Twitter
[0:33:50] <$JobbedBone> imagine being so threatened by another person sharing about their life LUL
[0:34:03] <ArashlTempesta> doodScrub
[0:34:18] <shinichizio> Is this a bit?
[0:34:19] <netarms> weird machines
[0:34:19] <%boatzndhoez> @cloakdank Good job you're great, now please go away :)
[0:34:29] <Zanmuto> I love the jerking motion he does
[0:34:33] <+askalta> hi plague
[0:34:49] <ArashlTempesta> cloud ate barret tuhuSuffer
[0:35:05] <thetruthofyourbeing> love your latest video plague. I find your content really helps me with my own work. love ya Bae
[0:35:07] <$JobbedBone> The cartoony FF6 style reactions are GREAT, I'm sad they got abandoned so fast but I guess it had to go when photorealism showed up
[0:35:12] <%octotasty> I wonder if they will keep the bizarre "Mako Energy bad, Coal Energy good" thing from the original in the remake
[0:35:16] <arkv01> shinra's got some updating to do, still running on windows me
[0:35:20] <%Heart0fInk> @cloakdank either leave or be quite dude. shove your tinfoil hat up your ass.
[0:35:24] <LVL1_Scumbag> Same design on the door too
[0:35:38] <smile64> i would like a panel designed by geiger
[0:35:55] <arkv01> probably cause it would clip into the wall, given the tech at the time
[0:36:00] <%Heart0fInk> Door Stuck! DOOR STUCK!!
[0:36:05] <netarms> 2 people
[0:36:39] <%Owkono> could be slum friends
[0:36:48] <redguyx85> could it be the people in their sector?
[0:36:54] <$JobbedBone> OvO
[0:36:55] <+PleasantLee> those door control pannels look like a skin for window media player
[0:36:56] <arkv01> holy shit these textures are going wild
[0:37:08] <Coystick> OneyNG ruined Phoenix Downs for me forever
[0:37:13] <thetruthofyourbeing> man jesse got me feeling something in remake
[0:37:13] <%octotasty> I like whey they do isometric views
[0:37:15] <%Aridpython> Many Bothans died getting these codes to avalanche
[0:37:16] <Daxalog> This looks like your running on magazine images
[0:37:54] <arkv01> can we get AI upscale for selfies so I can get some matches on tinder FeelsBadMan
[0:37:59] <$JobbedBone> its fun to see what it does to text that was too small to decipher clear lines on LUL
[0:38:04] <+KiwiRedgrave> me
[0:38:09] <redguyx85> why is the button so high?
[0:38:11] <netarms> i assume thats the robot voice over from the elevator
[0:38:18] <%boatzndhoez> I do miss remake Barret LUL
[0:38:20] <%RykerSkies> makes me sad that whatever 3D scene files they used to generate the backgrounds are most certainly lost forever
[0:38:26] <%octotasty> I wonder if those symbols are AI upscaled too
[0:38:27] <ralphwiggum16> Plague are there any goblins in this game?
[0:38:27] <+polothegreatest> plaguePog plaguePog plaguePog
[0:38:36] <+askalta> cloud and barret are 5'11 vs 6 ft
[0:38:49] <arkv01> no ai upscale here plague, we are huge :)
[0:38:50] <%JovianGargoyle> You saying we're fat
[0:38:50] <%KellBeII> smol chat
[0:38:51] <%octotasty> that mu there was probably interpreted by the AI
[0:38:51] <+PleasantLee> jessies open gob
[0:39:02] <netarms> jessie making the :O face
[0:39:02] <%Heart0fInk> Twitch chat is always too big for it's britches
[0:39:14] <Coystick> Please forgive my girth
[0:39:19] <arkv01> heh, fuck u lmao pay me
[0:39:48] <Coystick> Bulletmen probably

[0:40:01] <$JobbedBone> "haven't you heard that I'm a heartless pragmatist? respect be! >:("
[0:40:02] <%Heart0fInk> Thats racist.. Kappa
[0:40:11] <Coystick> Sentai Squad for the ultimate redundancy
[0:40:19] <%octotasty> it's amazing how all of Barret fits inside Cloud
[0:40:20] <%KellBeII> man, why isnt barret the main character.  I like his moxy, hes fired up
[0:40:39] <+askalta> I love the neon sign that says "Texas " in tifas bar
[0:40:52] <%Heart0fInk> UMMMM It's Tiff-A!!
[0:40:58] <%Owkono> it is Aeris in my child brain
[0:40:59] <arkv01> booty attack
[0:41:06] <arkv01> yeah it'll always be aeris for me
[0:41:09] <arkv01> and millions
[0:41:44] <%octotasty> 4
[0:41:45] <+PleasantLee> that big thing on the right
[0:41:46] <netarms> that round structure lookin bad
[0:41:48] <+PleasantLee> woof
[0:41:48] <ralphwiggum16> 4 is a great number!
[0:41:52] <PhilanthropyG> welcome to  s i l e n t   h i l l
[0:41:57] <arkv01> that looks like some beast wars era textures
[0:41:59] <ArashlTempesta> its vibing
[0:42:02] <%octotasty> it's made of flesh
[0:42:08] <netarms> actually melted
[0:42:14] <normalguycap> Wow, look at that crap. Throw this game in the trash. Just turn it off.
[0:42:19] <ralphwiggum16> It was originally on a standard def television.
[0:42:20] <+PleasantLee> it looks like a point and click games background assest, the game is 2d
[0:42:21] <+Mysticwaffle032> Plague Stream hype
[0:42:32] <PhilanthropyG> the mako reactor is just the great giant poo
[0:42:37] <Savage_Impulse> Titan butt plug
[0:42:41] <ralphwiggum16> I personally drew all of these backgrounds Plague!
[0:43:01] <netarms> the floor is kind of weird
[0:43:09] <arkv01> that floor is human flesh
[0:43:36] <%KellBeII> bile
[0:43:38] <$JobbedBone> I want to see what this thing would do to mario 64 LUL
[0:43:41] <%boatzndhoez> why...
[0:43:41] <%KellBeII> yes
[0:43:42] <PhilanthropyG> or a gas leak happened and it dried in
[0:43:42] <%Thornathis> yes
[0:43:43] <netarms> yes
[0:43:45] <%boatzndhoez> we can see it
[0:43:47] <Arc_Angle> definitely a van gogh
[0:43:57] <%Heart0fInk> Yeah i've seen that floor in a mens bathroom at a goodwill..
[0:44:00] <ralphwiggum16> One thing Resident Evil 2 did good well was making good backgrounds in fixed perspective.
[0:44:06] <%Owkono> plagueTaps
[0:44:08] <netarms> dora the explorer style
[0:44:08] <%octotasty> Plague the Explora
[0:44:16] <Coystick> Ah yes, the factory gimps
[0:44:35] <%Heart0fInk> are THESE the robo guards?
[0:44:49] <+PleasantLee> no idiot
[0:44:58] <%Heart0fInk> the blue men group i mean
[0:44:59] <normalguycap> It's embarrassing that Barret only shoots spitballs. And they kept that in the FF7R. The scene on the plate he unloads into the computer in rage. The very next camera shot? An undamaged computer.
[0:45:02] <+PleasantLee> these are the flyingseaweedguards
[0:45:04] <$JobbedBone> I love the fading away sound effects as things die
[0:45:32] <+PleasantLee> favourite cloud limit break?
[0:45:47] <$JobbedBone> cohhSus
[0:46:05] <netarms> meteor rain is really cool
[0:46:05] <PhilanthropyG> to unlock the .5, you use the LB a set ammount. to unlock the full .0, its a body count yea
[0:46:06] <+PleasantLee> I like climhazzard
[0:46:30] <%octotasty> AI upscaling hates characters
[0:46:32] <normalguycap> why does that concrete thing they are standing on look bloody?
[0:46:35] <netarms> it's spira language they planned it all along
[0:46:39] <$JobbedBone> O [mu] klv3
[0:46:50] <Coystick> Lived in texture
[0:46:52] <+PleasantLee> its on the ladder pipe beloew jessie too
[0:47:24] <normalguycap> Vines on the backwall there
[0:47:27] <%Heart0fInk> Always add character to an environment. even if it's small
[0:47:37] <CaptainDonk> I like the steamy toilet pipe at the bottom
[0:47:58] <normalguycap> This building is not up to code. No railings in sight.
[0:48:04] <smile64> tbf people turned off mgs2 when the fake colonel tells them to
[0:48:08] <%KellBeII> steam
[0:48:11] <arkv01> enjoy the fumes
[0:48:12] <netarms> fart vent
[0:48:13] <HanPaul> 💨
[0:48:22] <$JobbedBone> he thinks shinra workers have rights LUL
[0:48:25] <%octotasty> It's the farts of the planet
[0:48:34] <normalguycap> @smile64 I do not believe that.
[0:48:59] <%Heart0fInk> People die when they're killed. i fallow..
[0:49:33] <%octotasty> They become unsent animeted by Pyreflies, yes
[0:49:35] <%Thornathis> can't have people die in video games, kids can't handle basic concepts like that
[0:49:59] <rotche_yalla> there is no proof of that tho
[0:50:00] <%Owkono> nah throw it in the furnace
[0:50:01] <ralphwiggum16> The company is run by goblins.
[0:50:01] <normalguycap> Pssh, Legend of Dragoon and even Grandia had a few parts like that.
[0:50:03] <madiethemagepc> wait that actually hapen in the lore i thought that was just a game thing wtf?
[0:50:05] <netarms> 🦂
[0:50:24] <smile64> ffx did that well where only monsters had pyreflies come out when they die. normal humans and machina did not
[0:50:30] <%Heart0fInk> WOW!!!
[0:50:39] <%Heart0fInk> I loved how that flew apart!
[0:50:45] <Coystick> Dude just Gmod ragdolled

[0:51:14] <+PleasantLee> its so big it mindblows you
[0:51:18] <person181> does that mean if he does it too much it becomes smaller and thiner?
[0:51:18] <SovereignRota> BIG SHOT
[0:51:19] <%Aridpython> snuffCoomer
[0:51:22] <+Gigagoat> we love barrets big shot
[0:51:25] <$JobbedBone> BIG SH m6kwpressaKromegalul T
[0:51:27] <%KellBeII> barret shoots out full sized eggs

[0:51:27] <%boatzndhoez> plagueFear plague please
[0:51:28] <%Heart0fInk> He's got that big black arm canon that can't be contained
[0:51:37] <%eldercat> eldercat subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 2 months! Good to see your doing alright.
[0:51:38] <Coystick> You gotta keep your fluids up for the Big Shot.
[0:51:40] <PhilanthropyG> Nows your chance to
[0:51:46] <bepbopdrn> *Spamton intensifies*
[0:51:48] <mountain_megatherium> Now I am laughing at Cum Hazzard again.
[0:51:56] <arkv01> holy shit
[0:52:00] <arkv01> YOU CAN DO THIS?
[0:52:08] <$JobbedBone> clam hazard is already sexual enough
[0:52:13] <Coystick> Look at Barret's face, he's thinking about the Big Shot.
[0:52:46] <QueenT0fu> Hiii ❤️
[0:52:57] <%legioned247> Eli how are you
[0:52:57] <rotche_yalla> how the machine explodes is pretty funny
[0:53:08] <%octotasty> I like how those robots shoot polygons
[0:53:15] <%legioned247> your playing the best final fantasy 7
[0:53:29] <%legioned247> also I do the same thing
[0:53:35] <PhilanthropyG> Waited 40 minutes to get into XIV, crash error 30 seconds flat. RIP
[0:53:41] <normalguycap> I remember that article about that gamer that actually goes to level 99 in the rpg's he played.
[0:53:49] <+PleasantLee> you see the guy who grinded lvl100 here because some other guy said he would but didnt
[0:53:51] <%boatzndhoez> @PlagueOfGripes you gonna do the other parts of remake when they come out or not bother plagueNyoron
[0:53:58] <$JobbedBone> I can't not overlevel in RPGs. It feels optimal
[0:54:09] <%legioned247> God I own too many versions of this game
[0:54:16] <%KellBeII> youre probably couldnt play it now if you even waanted
[0:54:32] <%Runtripfall> I always grind against  Seymour Guado...
[0:54:34] <%boatzndhoez> heck, wanted to see your pov
[0:54:38] <arkv01> surely plague your curiousity will get the better of you 😏
[0:54:39] <+Gigagoat> the dlc gets anime af, I hate it.
[0:54:51] <normalguycap> Grind to me is a failure of good design. I hate it.
[0:54:57] <Coystick> I bet you will, you're gonna get swept up in the hype. I don't give a crap about 7 and I nearly did.
[0:55:01] <%TQuick101> they clearly don't read your name
[0:55:01] <normalguycap> Anime ruins everything.
[0:55:06] <Daxalog> Will you watch Pat play it?
[0:55:06] <%Heart0fInk> Boi cot the game. plagueHeh plagueHeh
[0:55:12] <netarms> they really didnt need to acknowledge dirge of cerberus in remake
[0:55:12] <+TipsyND> Where does those people think they are?
[0:55:22] <%KellBeII> i got yelled at earlier for criticising sekiro
[0:55:34] <%legioned247> Eli your dark souls video helped me understand what the hell was going on in dark soul 1
[0:55:43] <arkv01> yard of gravyy mmm
[0:55:56] <smile64> deepground being canon Kreygasm
[0:55:58] <Daxalog> I dont even know the point of playing it since i havent played 7 original.
[0:56:01] <%legioned247> also my favorite final fantasy is 6 eli I love 6 so much
[0:56:10] <%Owkono> getting ether rich as well in the graveyard?
[0:56:23] <arkv01> deepground being canon actually turned me off than the timeghosts
[0:56:32] <smile64> 6 is my fav as well
[0:56:38] <normalguycap> Plague Misadventures was a Megaman webcomic on the bobandgeorge website.
[0:56:39] <%legioned247> 6 holds up it had such a great story and characters
[0:56:40] <%octotasty> I will always criticize sekiro and I welcome the yelling.
[0:56:41] <crosscrusaderx> hello I love your videos, especially the Naruto one
[0:57:39] <%legioned247> anyone remember having the monster boy just leave the party and coming back with an assloads of characters
[0:57:47] <thetruthofyourbeing> started a ff9 playthrough again. vivi is my child
[0:57:52] <normalguycap> Not looking forward to Elden Ring either.
[0:57:58] <%legioned247> of skills not characters
[0:58:02] <normalguycap> Open world games are cancer.
[0:58:12] <%KellBeII> german spy said some concerning stuff.  said it kinda feels a bit too much like ds3 and that has me worried
[0:58:19] <%Thornathis> can't wait to climb ubisoft towers in elden ring
[0:58:23] <smile64> vivi and steiner were the highlights of my ff9 playthrough. didn't care for the overall plot though
[0:58:28] <arkv01> just ds3 with some very large open grassy fields
[0:58:33] <normalguycap> Exactly
[0:58:34] <arkv01> and some cliffs I guess
[0:58:43] <%legioned247> I don't care about elden ring unpopular opinion
[0:58:46] <Coystick> It can only be better than DaS3's combat, so there's that.
[0:59:03] <normalguycap> The Rushdown Singularity.
[0:59:14] <%WinWinRobin> WinWinRobin is gifting 5 Tier 1 Subs to PlagueOfGripes's community! They've gifted a total of 10 in the channel! 
[0:59:15] <Coystick> I didn't feel that in Bloodborne, but I felt it in DaS3.
[0:59:16] <%WinWinRobin> WinWinRobin gifted a Tier 1 sub to sinfullsaint! 
[0:59:16] <%WinWinRobin> WinWinRobin gifted a Tier 1 sub to arkv01!

[0:59:43] <rotche_yalla> The hoorsback fighting looks too game breaking
[0:59:49] <%legioned247> Eli you going play pokemon dark souls
[1:00:10] <%legioned247> plagueTaps plagueTaps plagueTaps
[1:00:21] <@Nightbot> Plague is a youtube animator and also streams at https://picarto.tv/Plague . Also: t-shirts! http://goo.gl/lze8QO
[1:00:23] <normalguycap> I'm sad they just dragged and dropped the crabs with no changes as far as I know. So lazy.
[1:00:30] <%Heart0fInk> I hope it isn't the case..
[1:00:39] <%Heart0fInk> DS3's late game sucks ass
[1:00:49] <%WinWinRobin> the open world stuff still has me have some doubts but I like most of modern fromsoft so I'll probably enjoy it
[1:01:02] <%arkv01> just become gatsu and hope for the best
[1:01:03] <%legioned247> dark souls 3 had angels for no reason
[1:01:03] <%octotasty> idk, kicking becomes pretty useless after the Undead Burg
[1:01:21] <%legioned247> why did dark souls 3 have angels
[1:01:29] <thetruthofyourbeing> " here is the game mechanics. you can't use them in the second half of the game btw Lmao"
[1:01:31] <normalguycap> My god, the pvp was terrible.
[1:01:43] <crosscrusaderx> is dsrk souls 1 worth buying
[1:01:47] <normalguycap> Roll and high estus speed made them excruciating long.
[1:01:53] <tolloponik> shikero's mechanics was the only game that worked for the entire game and for every enemies
[1:01:57] <%octotasty> DS1 is the best one. Get it
[1:01:58] <%Heart0fInk> @crosscrusaderx yes
[1:02:05] <normalguycap> @crosscrusaderx I'd say no.
[1:02:09] <rotche_yalla> why did dark souls 1 had fighting plants
[1:02:46] <%legioned247> El catnappa
[1:03:02] <%octotasty> DS PvP sucks anyway.
[1:03:04] <%boatzndhoez> SURELY this time they wont
[1:03:07] <tolloponik> it will be jumping around for pvp for the iframes you get off of it
[1:03:10] <%boatzndhoez> ...right?
[1:03:19] <%legioned247> deep blowa
[1:03:24] <%legioned247> blows
[1:03:27] <+askalta> you need to learn more about the sekiro mechanics being implemented
[1:03:29] <%legioned247> lol
[1:03:37] <PhilanthropyG> less swaying, more sliding
[1:03:38] <madiethemagepc> dark souls pvp has always lookedruff to me
[1:03:43] <normalguycap> FromSoftware has NEVER fixed their input queue problem with any of their modern souls games. Embarrassing.
[1:03:44] <%WinWinRobin> really like the new sona design btw
[1:03:48] <%arkv01> you rub the bomb cloud
[1:03:50] <+deepseamonster> Nice flannel
[1:03:50] <%arkv01> I'll go home
[1:03:52] <+DrTribal> i enjoyed 3's pvp but i played alot with friends so thats a bias
[1:04:01] <askeladd99> cat
[1:04:04] <%legioned247> he was a mercenary
[1:04:08] <%Heart0fInk> Whats This!? Plague Kitty Is Evolving! plagueNyoron
[1:04:09] <%mountain_megatherium> plagueTaps
[1:04:12] <+TipsyND> Why now though?

[1:04:21] <%legioned247> plagueTaps plagueTaps plagueTaps
[1:04:22] <+PleasantLee> barret talks to the planet....hes clearly a bit off the hook
[1:04:23] <%octotasty> Cloud does have a history for stabbing people in the back in reactors though
[1:04:29] <normalguycap> Because cliche writing
[1:04:48] <+ShinHadokenman> I think it was Zack?
[1:04:49] <%legioned247> artth
[1:04:54] <PhilanthropyG> Zack attack
[1:05:01] <RunningNGunning> I mean cloud "was in SOLDIER" so he Barret has some reason to not trust him
[1:05:04] <%legioned247> brain damage
[1:05:07] <%boatzndhoez> i think it was tifa
[1:05:08] <+ShinHadokenman> Oh riight
[1:05:12] <%arkv01> sephiroth I think? Kinda vague too
[1:05:34] <PhilanthropyG> first day mcdonalds employee teen cloud
[1:05:38] <%Heart0fInk> Cloud has milk in his brain
[1:05:43] <shinichizio> Ooh! Mr. Shinra's gonna kill me!
[1:06:04] <%legioned247> I remember fighting this a hole
[1:06:06] <%arkv01> would've been cool if this appeared later in the game and then mech transformed into the clod
[1:06:09] <$JobbedBone> mario RPG enemy
[1:06:10] <%Owkono> didn't this reactor house some jenova experiment stuff?
[1:06:31] <%Heart0fInk> The demo for FF7R is good.
[1:06:40] <%Heart0fInk> the rest of it tho....
[1:06:46] <%Traximus_V> is barret going to make the slip up
[1:06:47] <normalguycap> haha yeah
[1:06:47] <%Heart0fInk> yikes...
[1:07:14] <%legioned247> I haven't played remake
[1:07:29] <%legioned247> kind of don't care to play it
[1:07:30] <+PleasantLee> ELI! attack when the tail is UP!
[1:07:37] <normalguycap> what a missed opportunity that FF7R went with dementor-time-ghosts instead of more Eco stuff given how bad our real world is. Would been way more relevant and striking.
[1:07:52] <PhilanthropyG> like a dumb mechanical crab
[1:08:02] <+PleasantLee> .....why didnt they put this boss in a KH game? it would look spot on
[1:08:07] <thetruthofyourbeing> excited for the ff6 remaster
[1:08:25] <%legioned247> there remaking ff6
[1:08:28] <%arkv01> Watch out! The roboscorpion is horny!
[1:08:39] <shinichizio> And there it is, the best boss fight tip in video games
[1:08:44] <rotche_yalla> thinking about the military practicality of a robot loke this
[1:09:00] <%Heart0fInk> The way you said "Thunder" reminds me of Sora from KH1
[1:09:11] <normalguycap> @rotche_yalla That's the fantasy part of this game.
[1:09:23] <normalguycap> 90s fantasy
[1:09:28] <rotche_yalla> ye
[1:09:48] <%legioned247> dead
[1:09:48] <smile64> the pixel remasters disappoint me.   lacking the content of previous versions
[1:09:52] <normalguycap> Thunder juice. I want that in a game now.
[1:10:01] <%Traximus_V> that was fast
[1:10:03] <%JovianGargoyle> derpyd3Backy plagueTaps
[1:10:14] <+VictorVonLouche> There is a minor puzzle to bosses to play around.
[1:10:25] <normalguycap> I never get tired of that ONEY goofy compilation
[1:11:07] <normalguycap> Plauge's avatar when he said: "this game does not like being full screen."
[1:11:10] <rotche_yalla> the shoes of these robots are adorable
[1:11:17] <normalguycap> Looked like a sassy black lady, "uh uh honey"
[1:11:19] <%arkv01> the jump looks decent actually
[1:11:42] <$JobbedBone> W means double because its double U
[1:11:45] <%arkv01> like big clown shoes
[1:12:09] <normalguycap> It's made as well as an American car.
[1:12:29] <%arkv01> would've been wild if we could just leave her here and she never got unstuck
[1:12:40] <normalguycap> Innovation
[1:12:43] <+FingaLights> Help, Step- Mercenary My leg is stuck
[1:12:46] <normalguycap> would have broke new ground
[1:13:07] <normalguycap> Are those flamingo guns?
[1:13:18] <%KellBeII> boony?
[1:13:32] <normalguycap> YEs
[1:13:35] <+VictorVonLouche> Yes
[1:13:37] <+reiface08> yes that's awesome
[1:13:38] <%Owkono> it good
[1:13:39] <normalguycap> So good for immersion
[1:13:39] <%Thornathis> yeah
[1:13:43] <%boatzndhoez> both are good for different reasons tbh
[1:13:49] <N8r_Tot> yes VoHiYo
[1:14:03] <%KellBeII> yup
[1:14:12] <%KellBeII> the music gets interrupted by every enemy
[1:14:39] <%KellBeII> its one of the most importaant moments in the game and the tone is completely shattered
[1:14:44] <+FingaLights> But how would you know you are in BATTLE
[1:14:50] <+FingaLights> Without mussics
[1:15:01] <tolloponik> front towards enemy?
[1:15:01] <theloganbrand> It's a slur
[1:15:02] <+VictorVonLouche> P5 original runs the final dungeon by having the generic battle music play on mobs.
[1:15:08] <+VictorVonLouche> ruins*
[1:15:12] <%boatzndhoez> pvpLeave
[1:15:19] <person181> he's bluffing, he can't ban all of us
[1:15:28] <theloganbrand> She's down bad
[1:15:28] <%arkv01> she's kind of dumb cute here yeah
[1:15:31] <+PleasantLee> the japanese on their arms say "flammable"
[1:15:35] <+PleasantLee> kaki genkin
[1:15:43] <N8r_Tot> he's bluffing NotLikeThis we're all banned regardless
[1:15:50] <+FingaLights> I always saw her as a cute nerd that loves explosions
[1:15:52] <Coystick> In the remake that explosion comes from Jessi's cooter
[1:15:52] <+PleasantLee> those japanese lessons are paying off
[1:15:53] <%arkv01> oh this looks nice actually
[1:15:57] <shinichizio> "Small leave me alone"
[1:15:57] <%arkv01> quite grimy
[1:16:04] <$JobbedBone> Grunts and their variations each have four kanji on their arms, translating to "flammable"
[1:16:12] <$JobbedBone> darn you guys are fast
[1:16:43] <%Owkono> I assumed that she is setting another bomb here
[1:17:08] <+PleasantLee> sounds like shes playing an atari
[1:17:35] <madiethemagepc> i definitly perfer the way the remake tells the story in alot of areas
[1:17:48] <RunningNGunning> I like that the remake lets you explore more of the top layer of Midgard, I wish there was more of it in the remake
[1:17:53] <+FingaLights> Sigma Barret
[1:17:54] <normalguycap> Can we voice Cloud from here on out as a pathetic weeb?
[1:18:10] <+PleasantLee> yeah
[1:18:11] <%Heart0fInk> "We'll Pay You In NFT's Cloud.."
[1:18:13] <normalguycap> No because Loveless was stupid
[1:18:22] <%arkv01> no because I endured crisis core :(
[1:18:23] <+PleasantLee> ....aww
[1:18:32] <+askalta> I think its gackt x sephiroth fanfic
[1:18:35] <+PleasantLee> call her stupid
[1:18:37] <RunningNGunning> Isn't it a reference to a My Bloody Valentine album?
[1:18:37] <+VictorVonLouche> Crisis Core, which was ok, just that one character sucked
[1:18:38] <+PleasantLee> pull her hair
[1:18:39] <%Traximus_V> hey

[1:19:06] <person181> he can see our souls
[1:19:07] <+VictorVonLouche> That death stare
[1:19:09] <Dragonfighter46> no she deserves to be called a stinky head
[1:19:09] <%boatzndhoez> LUL this is pretty good

[1:22:00] <+TipsyND> There's a truck upside down behind her and the only thing she wants is sell her flower?
[1:22:02] <%KellBeII> you should probably update your sub goal at some point
[1:22:02] <%legioned247> lol
[1:22:06] <%boatzndhoez> how could you not though :D
[1:22:13] <madiethemagepc> it shoudve happened but it didnt

[1:22:34] <Mathochism> Super Beast over. Plague time nao.
[1:22:34] <theloganbrand> the problem with being 3d models is she LOOKS like a main character and not a jumble of polygons

[1:24:46] <%Aridpython> Didn’t the remake show Rufus pressing a button to make the explosion worse or am I crazy?

[1:27:30] <+D4C_Trice> I beat the remake and the dlc recently.  it's definitely a 7/10 the game to me
[1:27:33] <+ShinHadokenman> murder is bad ya know
[1:27:36] <+ShinHadokenman> FUN but bad
[1:27:42] <normalguycap> Not when you're the hero
[1:27:58] <+Mekhet09> I think honestly for me atmospherically the fact that the slums in ff7r have a day and night cycle is the worst part.
[1:28:01] <normalguycap> Same with trespassing, breaking and entering, theft. Hero's get free passes.
[1:28:02] <%octotasty> they 3D modeled, rendered them and downscaled them to hilariously low resolutions the PS1 could handle
[1:28:23] <+Mekhet09> modders with drama. NO.
[1:28:34] <normalguycap> lol
[1:28:36] <%arkv01> 15fps is home :)
[1:28:43] <%Owkono> remako?

[1:30:17] <Schuhart> Memphis Tenessee
[1:30:25] <TheGuesty> @dan_g_v only if you been to 4chan
[1:30:34] <%octotasty> it was Memphis, Tenessee
[1:30:38] <%Aridpython> “I’m not a gamer, maybe they’ll respect me!” “That just makes you a beta cuck “
[1:30:46] <cartakus> Hold up
[1:30:54] <normalguycap> I remember this in the Remake. Cloud makes such a hilariously stupid gesture when he lands.
[1:30:58] <LVL1_Scumbag> Just a little
[1:30:58] <%Owkono> I always liked these blocky models
[1:30:59] <jowi_time> LUL
[1:30:59] <slackerunchained> ...
[1:30:59] <normalguycap> He thought that was so cool to do
[1:31:04] <+TipsyND> Gonna edge those bullets
[1:31:11] <%JovianGargoyle> partyd13MinPOG
[1:31:12] <+D4C_Trice> How often does he do a "tactical reload" if you catch my drift
[1:31:13] <Jaysky> Clout dropping
[1:31:13] <+CutCombo> Edge the inputs
[1:31:15] <%JoshManVGH> Edge Master Barret

[1:31:28] <sirtommygunn> pretty sure its jumping up actually, keep talking about Barret's cum
[1:31:32] <%Aridpython> White knuckle grip on his gun plagueHarkness
[1:31:34] <madiethemagepc> sometimes that i forget that horny is plauges brand
[1:31:38] <Onamar> Katakana?
[1:31:40] <ruleofthespear> katakana
[1:31:42] <jowi_time> make the text bigger?
[1:31:43] <yukichocomilk> katakana
[1:31:43] <%Engwithan_Elder_God> Probably the fancy kanji.
[1:31:43] <Augus7717> in bold maybe?
[1:31:46] <%mountain_megatherium> Cum for Plague talking about bricks stay for the Big Shot.
[1:31:49] <normalguycap> Cocktakana
[1:31:52] <+GlassesFreek> Shouting
[1:31:53] <sirtommygunn> increase font size
[1:31:53] <tolloponik> brackets [] around it I think
[1:32:07] <slackerunchained> You know, the clarification that Jessie is ULTRA-THIRSTY for Cloud clears up a lot of her character actions, in hindsight.
[1:32:11] <%JoshManVGH> I always assumed it was a dumb Acronym
[1:32:11] <ArashlTempesta> they write it in english tuhuHeh
[1:32:16] <+wizard_of_diamonds> Seath the Scaeless has got to be one of the most cancer fights I've encountered so far in DS1
[1:32:16] <LVL1_Scumbag> Really big squiglies
[1:32:16] <%Heart0fInk> Hehehehehehe you said Do do..
[1:32:24] <+PleasantLee> no its all symbols, theres no size difference unless the sound is changed
[1:32:39] <%Engwithan_Elder_God> waaaa?

[1:32:46] <%boatzndhoez> plagueTaps
[1:32:47] <gyrokinesis> I wonder why
[1:32:47] <cartakus> He THICC
[1:32:48] <+King_floppy> he loves cats too
[1:32:49] <%Heart0fInk> Becuz fat you see
[1:32:51] <normalguycap> Seath was only bothersome for me when trying to cut his tail. It took so long and I hate to look up that you can only cut the tip.
[1:32:51] <amymist> me too wedge
[1:32:53] <LuxCelestia> Plaguecat's surprised face there was so damn cute.
[1:32:56] <+VictorVonLouche> At least he has cats in remake.
[1:32:58] <+D4C_Trice> Japan is very boring for certain tropes
[1:33:01] <%arkv01> please barret I've been subsisting on doritos for a week now
[1:33:04] <%legioned247> plagueBark plagueBark plagueBark plagueBark
[1:33:04] <+Fefe41> To be fair most people do like to eat
[1:33:21] <DaKnightWarrior> It did the characters really well.
[1:33:21] <shadepman> wedge sure is a big boy
[1:33:23] <%Owkono> I love Barrett
[1:33:26] <madiethemagepc> the man likes to eat i can relate
[1:33:33] <+VictorVonLouche> They do most of the characters really well.
[1:33:38] <+D4C_Trice> He loves food and cats
[1:33:38] <%MightyDuckShoes> he likes cats too!
[1:33:46] <BooitsDock> loves cats
[1:33:54] <sirtommygunn> who dislikes food
[1:33:57] <%boatzndhoez> hes a crazy cat guy :)
[1:34:04] <%boatzndhoez> and likes food :)
[1:34:05] <+RayReborne> like Im a big boi too and i dont talk about food NEARLY as much as Potato Wedge here
[1:34:05] <sirtommygunn> like who is making a stand against eating food that tastes good
[1:34:11] <tolloponik> it's very solid fan-fiction with really dumb hic ups
[1:34:11] <cartakus> The big boi from arcane was pretty nice
[1:34:12] <+PleasantLee> loves food so much that he eats jessies family out of house and home
[1:34:16] <+VictorVonLouche> Its like they got stuck on that character trait, scared of changing them too much.
[1:34:22] <Dunmarkh> oh god
[1:34:22] <LVL1_Scumbag> Aww
[1:34:23] <TheGuesty> O_O
[1:34:27] <+FingaLights> :0
[1:34:28] <%arkv01> somehow I don't think the mouth mod is an improvement
[1:34:29] <%Explodincatz> Ive never played either of them and know Barret is the best part of Remake
[1:34:50] <sirtommygunn> thats fair
[1:34:54] <cartakus> I pitty the fool
[1:34:56] <TheGuesty> lytOUCH
[1:34:57] <%boatzndhoez> I pity the foo' who don't know
[1:34:59] <%MightyDuckShoes> I PITY THOSE FOOLS
[1:35:01] <%legioned247> I pity those fools
[1:35:05] <DaKnightWarrior> Man i feel old LUL
[1:35:06] <+PleasantLee> I aint gettin on no plane!
[1:35:06] <chuca77> wait is barret not Mr T?
[1:35:07] <+CutCombo> Mr.Tea?
[1:35:07] <crosscrusaderx> me
[1:35:08] <+Mekhet09> I feel he's too much of a meme.
[1:35:09] <+askalta> pity the fool
[1:35:09] <TheFramedWarlock> Pity the fools
[1:35:10] <+captain_thickthighs> I I know but I was born in the '90s
[1:35:10] <DisneylandPimp> i've seen the A-team movie that came out in the 200s
[1:35:11] <+VictorVonLouche> Mr T was just so Iconic back then.
[1:35:11] <sirtommygunn> everyone knows Mr T, but now some people might only know him from the World of Warcraft commercials
[1:35:12] <theloganbrand> Night Elf Mohawk
[1:35:13] <TheGuesty> BJ
[1:35:16] <+RayReborne> Even I thought of mister T, and i played this game in grade 9, 2011
[1:35:17] <TechDragon_Z> He was a WOW mascot for a bit. Remember that?
[1:35:18] <Mikers29> Hes that guy from the world of Warcraft commercial
[1:35:19] <+PleasantLee> I aint gettin on no highwind!
[1:35:23] <$JobbedBone> is that the Action Hank guy?
[1:35:25] <%Traximus_V> A Team right?
[1:35:30] <Pappajimbo> I aint getting in no mako reactor fool!
[1:35:32] <TheGuesty> He also played the wise janitor in Not Another Teen Movie
[1:35:32] <%mountain_megatherium> Don't disappoint your mama
[1:35:35] <%Owkono> he was on commercials more recently too i think
[1:35:38] <DisneylandPimp> remember the A-team movie that came out in 2010 ?
[1:35:39] <tolloponik> I feel were on the last generation to know about the A-team
[1:35:43] <+FingaLights> Tsun Tsun Barret
[1:35:43] <+PleasantLee> does barret ever say 'jibba jabba'?
[1:35:46] <madiethemagepc> i know who he is but only through cultural osmosis
[1:35:54] <%Heart0fInk> Thats racist
[1:35:55] <TheFramedWarlock> WOW
[1:35:56] <+Jakeofalco> woah now
[1:35:58] <+Fefe41> "its not like i cared about you or anything cloud"
[1:35:58] <bear_breaker20> cmonBruh
[1:35:59] <+skyshinecrusader> Its true
[1:36:01] <+askalta> cancelled
[1:36:04] <+RayReborne> Ok Wedge thanks Kappa
[1:36:04] <%cooldude69xx> *eats cloud*
[1:36:14] <+Arek_1> "I'm Mr. T and I'm a Night Elf MOHAWK! What's YOUR game!?"
[1:36:21] <+Mekhet09> He's the hot one.
[1:36:26] <+King_floppy> Charlie Sheen right?
[1:36:27] <wolfen091> bigs?  oh you mean Charlie sheen?
[1:36:27] <+Jakeofalco> charie sheen
[1:36:28] <%cooldude69xx> He looks like a guy
[1:36:30] <allofthemused> charlie sheen
[1:36:32] <TheGuesty> Biggs looks like Paul Rudd in Remake
[1:36:34] <%MightyDuckShoes> he looks Charlie Sheen from Platoon
[1:36:37] <slackerunchained> Blackface Cloud... Where's Woolie?
[1:36:39] <jowi_time> I thought Jesse was a guy when I played this way back when
[1:36:40] <+RayReborne> god the open mouths is WEIRD LUL
[1:36:41] <TheFramedWarlock> In the remake she is DEHYDRATED
[1:36:42] <+captain_thickthighs> @plagueofgripes as a neutral third party I want your opinion tifa is hotter but I feel Aerith will be better in the sack because of her personality
[1:36:42] <shadepman> remake biggs is really cute imo
[1:36:43] <+RadWrecked> i thought jesse was a guy and biggs a girl
[1:36:46] <+VictorVonLouche> yeah
[1:36:49] <+Mekhet09> You know I never realized that cloud was in black face.
[1:36:50] <+PleasantLee> I was very upset when jessie died
[1:36:51] <+D4C_Trice> Huh. he does look like Charlie Sheen
[1:36:53] <+RayReborne> OMG YOU'RE RIGHT GOD
[1:36:56] <theloganbrand> Remake Jessie will try and touch your penis
[1:37:01] <+RaveBV> She's anime level into you in the remake.
[1:37:02] <cartakus> It looks like cloud was suppose to fuck everyone in avalanche
[1:37:13] <%MightyDuckShoes> I liked all these guys in the remake. but I just really liked Midgard.
[1:37:19] <%TQuick101> A fellow man of culture I see
[1:37:23] <ruleofthespear> Tifa is a stick in the mud, team mom.
[1:37:24] <person181> but that IS her personality :p
[1:37:27] <%legioned247> yes
[1:37:28] <%Owkono> slap fight
[1:37:30] <DaKnightWarrior> I agree.
[1:37:37] <+yoshkosh20> she doesn't feel like a punch lady
[1:37:37] <%arkv01> remake tifa tho 😅
[1:37:38] <+PleasantLee> ff7r tifa is alot better, but still 2nd best
[1:37:38] <Jaysky> Mommy?
[1:37:38] <TheGuesty> She needed to be V from the Arcane cartoon, but straight
[1:37:39] <GurrenGyaru> She-s Punch Mom
[1:37:40] <+skyshinecrusader> She has the big sis appeal
[1:37:41] <%Heart0fInk> Mommy milkers? what?
[1:37:43] <Eger007> plus tragedy is kinda hot
[1:37:43] <+D4C_Trice> I find that I quite like remake Jessie as she reminds of a better Rise from P4
[1:37:43] <tolloponik> original jess is real girl flirting ,while remake is fantasy to kind of sad
[1:37:44] <+heyitsbrian> all monks aren't punch girls, even the punch girls
[1:37:44] <sirtommygunn> Barret is the only correct waifu choice in this game
[1:37:45] <DaKnightWarrior> she's got a heart of gold tho.
[1:37:48] <bear_breaker20> tifa is the one that 'saves him'
[1:37:50] <tanarath> Aerith was more of a tomboy than tifa.
[1:37:51] <+RaveBV> BIG BOY
[1:37:52] <kevamadi> That description is VERY apparent in Remake...
[1:37:52] <+Jakeofalco> Every Japanese mans dream woman
[1:37:54] <+RayReborne> she's a homely nice girl, who is insanely hoy and can kick your ass. so every 12 yr old boys dream girl Kappa
[1:37:55] <jowi_time> LUl
[1:37:56] <%whyskeywolfe> It’s weird how Aeris was the playful one and Tifa was the Yamato Nadeshiko, and yet the fanbase reversed that.
[1:37:57] <shadepman> mommy tifa Kreygasm
[1:38:01] <%boatzndhoez> polytitties
[1:38:01] <%MightyDuckShoes> Tifa is the tradwife. It's like her and Aeris were designed to have swapped personalities versus their appearance
[1:38:10] <theloganbrand> Have you now?
[1:38:11] <ChrisPlaysThing> huehuehue
[1:38:15] <TheGuesty> You will die from the sharpness of those polygons.  I have seen the Oney cartoon
[1:38:16] <+King_floppy> she's girl next door+badass bartender+concerned old friend who doesnt know how to respond to Cloud's fuckin' weird behanvior
[1:38:16] <Feraligatrmcbum> " I think about my father being called 'boy', my uncle being called 'boy', my brother, coming back from Vietnam and being called 'boy'. So I questioned myself: "What does a black man have to do before he's given respect as a man?" So when I was 18 years old, when I was old enough to fight and die for my country, old enough to drink, old enough to vote, I said I was old enough to be called a man. I self-ordained myself Mr. T, so the first word out of everybody's mouth is "Mr." "
[1:38:24] <+VictorVonLouche> Like she's kinda happy with where she's at in the slums in the remake and is sort of along for the ride until it effects her.
[1:38:29] <+Arek_1> Tifa is emotionally stunted like Cloud due to reasons.
[1:38:29] <kes009900> did someone know you were there?
[1:38:31] <+D4C_Trice> cooky
[1:38:40] <RetributionP> tbh none of them have a whole lot going on. but yeah areth is the better of the 2
[1:38:43] <jowi_time> YUP
[1:39:00] <bear_breaker20> shes a fuckin disney princess
[1:39:06] <+RayReborne> and then turns into Girl Jesus in the comp.  it sucks
[1:39:09] <bear_breaker20> complete w waterfall
[1:39:18] <+captain_thickthighs> yeah Tifa seems demure Aerith seems like she's actually down to try stuff. note I only touched the remake
[1:39:21] <cartakus> lmao shit sucks...moving on
[1:39:22] <GurrenGyaru> I think it was on purpose to make Tifa the motherly one who takes care of everyone "classic ff love interest type" and Aerith being the complete opposite of the way she looks like.
[1:39:23] <+D4C_Trice> oh she's like a uni student that has finally gotten the first taste of not being under their parents thumb
[1:39:31] <GurrenGyaru> they both oppose the way they look like
[1:39:47] <+skyshinecrusader> Tifa is a tough girl who is nice contrary to her image. while aeris is a cute girl who is tough contrary to her image
[1:39:56] <tolloponik> gotta get to work some how PoroSad
[1:39:56] <LVL1_Scumbag> Or it's been a 10 hour train ride
[1:39:58] <@Nightbot> Plague is a youtube animator and also streams at https://picarto.tv/Plague . Also: t-shirts! http://goo.gl/lze8QO
[1:40:07] <StaceMcGate> is Midgar the name of the continent?
[1:40:11] <+PleasantLee> maybe its like the clock in back to the future and its stuck there as a monument
[1:40:14] <%Engwithan_Elder_God> None of that Daylight Saving Time bullshit in Migdar.
[1:40:15] <+Shockrates20XX> same as Greenwich Mean Time.
[1:40:15] <sirtommygunn> last stop coming up at "Shithole Garbagetown"
[1:40:16] <+RayReborne> @skyshinecrusader yeah that's how i see it
[1:40:18] <%whyskeywolfe> You mean like Greenwich Mean Time?
[1:40:18] <tanarath> Greenwich Mean Time
[1:40:19] <+captain_thickthighs> @d4c_trice that's the energy back I college you wanted to look for 🔥
[1:40:23] <ChrisPlaysThing> Poor Time and Rich Time
[1:40:26] <%legioned247> racist
[1:40:39] <+RayReborne> i missed it but i love TP
[1:40:40] <tolloponik> it was?
[1:40:44] <+D4C_Trice> What is Johnny like in this version? he's insufferable I'm remake to me
[1:40:46] <brexdq> best Zelda game
[1:40:48] <%boatzndhoez> No clue LUL
[1:40:52] <+RayReborne> yup, the goat herder guy
[1:40:53] <%KellBeII> funny enough, i was just watching the mathewmatosis review for TP earlier today
[1:40:55] <+D4C_Trice> *in
[1:41:00] <%legioned247> is that majora mask
[1:41:00] <+M0untain_wolf> DUM
[1:41:03] <+Jakeofalco> Pigtails ?
[1:41:05] <TheGuesty> Sumo sound effects
[1:41:05] <%cooldude69xx> That man is the reason the game takes so long to open up, STG
[1:41:06] <TheGuesty> yes
[1:41:15] <alroy909> yeah the goat guy!
[1:41:18] <+RayReborne> i love that minigame fuck everyone, its not that hard imo
[1:41:27] <kjb343> Goat in!
[1:41:28] <wolfen091> the guy who shouts ehhhhhhyyyyy
[1:41:40] <%MightyDuckShoes> did that bum get an extended character arc in the remake? cause he should have
[1:41:46] <%legioned247> don't be sorry
[1:41:48] <+D4C_Trice> you get a heart piece too if you return later I think?
[1:41:55] <+RayReborne> @wolfen091 but thats most zelda characters Kappa
[1:42:06] <tolloponik> I always blast past that dialogue
[1:42:07] <%arkv01> shinra overtime took all his follicles
[1:42:09] <+FingaLights> Newspaapers are quick
[1:42:26] <%Heart0fInk> :O
[1:42:28] <sirtommygunn> love the permanent open mouth
[1:42:30] <TheGuesty> cartman
[1:42:50] <+RayReborne> yeah Influencers are Terrorists, you're right Plague Kappa
[1:42:51] <+M0untain_wolf> What happen to her lips?
[1:42:52] <%legioned247> I also remember random stuff can't remember how to do calculatus but I can remember random ass robot chicken
[1:43:00] <%legioned247> and most of this game
[1:43:03] <tanarath> Excuse me, Plague. The term is Freedom Fighter.
[1:43:05] <cartakus> Biggs looks better
[1:43:10] <%arkv01> cute mouths
[1:43:19] <%boatzndhoez> NOT THIS
[1:43:20] <TheGuesty> this was gonna be a N64 game
[1:43:20] <%Owkono> nyannPOG
[1:43:20] <%arkv01> jesse is asking you to insert coin
[1:43:21] <$hypergenn2> This was gamebreakingly beautiful for its time
[1:43:31] <squareofthelightones> but why do they have blow-up doll mouthes?
[1:43:32] <sirtommygunn> do the majority of the work with the simple models to keep development quick
[1:43:37] <%legioned247> yes
[1:43:39] <%MightyDuckShoes> it looks better when you take into consideration this was supposed to be on N64.
[1:43:40] <+xjavx2014> LUL NotLikeThis
[1:43:40] <BedHome> i should let this inspire me to make stuff despite being terrible at modelling
[1:44:00] <+D4C_Trice> sounds like a dev nightmare putting all those together
[1:44:03] <tanarath> It could have looked like ff8,but the n64 didn't really have processing power.
[1:44:10] <Ubu2933> she's about to femsplain the city to you
[1:44:15] <+PleasantLee> think she'll make it back for FF7r2?
[1:44:23] <+skyshinecrusader> Its why sometimes tifa has giant knockers sometimes but othertimes they arent too large
[1:44:28] <%legioned247> I love the weapons in final fantasy 7 diamond ruby emerald
[1:44:39] <BedHome> technology is when the magic has electricity and gears in it
[1:44:39] <+PleasantLee> I never understood wtf I was looking at on this screen as a kid
[1:44:48] <+FingaLights> Enough to almost do stuff, but not enough to not fuck up
[1:45:00] <%Heart0fInk> I'm not tech savvy at all. i break all my shit all the time
[1:45:02] <kinkade_77> shes realistically smart
[1:45:03] <cartakus> Midgar is just the city?
[1:45:14] <%legioned247> why is the planet making bio weapons to kill all life on the planet
[1:45:17] <sirtommygunn> Guarantee I would mess up my first bomb
[1:45:19] <tanarath> And it's great.
[1:45:25] <shadepman> wonder how this game would’ve turned out if square stuck with nintendo
[1:45:28] <+captain_thickthighs> have you tried mods on this?
[1:45:32] <%legioned247> planet be crazy
[1:45:33] <+PleasantLee> its way bigger in ff7r
[1:45:36] <+RayReborne> thats small af
[1:45:36] <sirtommygunn> pretty high
[1:45:37] <+M0untain_wolf> IMERPRIAL
[1:45:41] <rotche_yalla> thats not much
[1:45:51] <PlebianNoob> 16 stories? about
[1:45:54] <+FingaLights> Nothing say's freedom like IMPERIAL
[1:45:59] <ruleofthespear> how many football fields?
[1:46:01] <+D4C_Trice> the way they make Shinra moustache twirling for making the reactors worse is cartoonish and a bit dumb.
[1:46:03] <%Heart0fInk> Not the 30 fuckin miles they made it in Remake?
[1:46:14] <+Whiskey_T_Foxtrot> maybe these are all gnome-sized people
[1:46:21] <%JovianGargoyle> No need for air traffic warning light.
[1:46:33] <Ubu2933> I feel like they say 200 meters somehwere else was that in the remake?
[1:46:40] <+PleasantLee> in ff7r cloud "breaks" his fall with the zipwire gun before falling into aeris's church. take like 50 feet off of 500 foot fall
[1:46:43] <cartakus> oof
[1:46:45] <+Mekhet09> You're implying that the slums' are above ground.
[1:46:47] <+Whiskey_T_Foxtrot> it's a pretty efficient fuel source tbh
[1:46:48] <rotche_yalla> thats rad
[1:46:49] <+RayReborne> oh yeah, this name detail
[1:46:50] <+FingaLights> SICK
[1:47:00] <+RayReborne> wonder what names they would've had?
[1:47:01] <%LightTumbly> To be fair, we'd burn them too if we could
[1:47:01] <person181> always going to have orphins
[1:47:03] <PlebianNoob> Burn the orphan souls to boot up the stream
[1:47:04] <BedHome> are adults who outlive their parents orphans?
[1:47:05] <wuzzlzz> i wish *i* could burn the souls of orphans for electricity
[1:47:07] <ChrisPlaysThing> Burn the souls of the dead to power your Real Doll
[1:47:20] <kinkade_77> i never thought about midgar before shinra
[1:47:25] <%MightyDuckShoes> well that explains the Midgard standard time.
[1:48:00] <sirtommygunn> Then some rich bastard decided to make a supercity their pet project
[1:48:24] <TheGuesty> Gary, IN...  stinky place
[1:48:26] <+Whiskey_T_Foxtrot> midgary
[1:48:29] <TheGuesty> Michael Jackson was born there
[1:48:43] <+askalta> midgar is a rust belt city for sure
[1:48:47] <sirtommygunn> Gary knows what it did
[1:48:52] <+D4C_Trice> there's a video on YouTube that goes into why Gary Indiana is the most depressing place in america
[1:48:56] <ChrisPlaysThing> You gotta be careful when you make a snowman in Gary, Indiana. you put a hat on that thing it's goign to go around committing crimes
[1:49:02] <+BinaryFireball> rax rax raxxxxxxxx
[1:49:07] <BedHome> there was a larp like this in my university town. where the local midsize university city became the first arcology megacity in the country

[1:50:07] <+Mekhet09> @PlagueOfGripes kind of minor nitpick but 50 feat above ground doesn't imply that all of midgar is above ground level.
[1:50:14] <+RayReborne> man the og soundtrack still holds up
[1:50:30] <BedHome> cieling hand anuses
[1:50:30] <tolloponik> 3-4

[1:51:06] <%cooldude69xx> @RayReborne Ps1 was definitely the point where soundtracks got "modern" enough to stand the test of time
[1:51:23] <+Betofall> This gave me the impression the slums never saw sunlight
[1:51:25] <+BinaryFireball> that fuck pizza

[1:52:09] <+captain_thickthighs> waaaaaaiit so if you squint a little bit arcane could be a story set in midgar and it would still work
[1:52:11] <ArashlTempesta> just stop being poor

[1:54:22] <Shwepie> Remake rambling about fate is probably the devs butting in so they can make a sequel instead of a remake.
[1:54:30] <BedHome> stuck in socio economic traps
[1:54:31] <whittacre> it's fate of inevitability vs destiny
[1:54:32] <%kyh9> kyh9 subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 23 months! Economic and class determinism

[1:58:27] <ChrisPlaysThing> It just *WASN'T* a REMAKE
[1:58:28] <StaceMcGate> wonder how much of that is due to the nature of translations back in the day
[1:58:35] <StaceMcGate> what we got vs what international audiences got
[1:58:38] <+Mekhet09> I think there were huge ascetics changes that sucks.
[1:58:41] <ChrisPlaysThing> And that makes all the difference
[1:58:44] <+captain_thickthighs> what ff7 is now is the poster child now it's pop

[2:14:31] <+D4C_Trice> they look like those glass elixirs from a old doctor's
[2:14:32] <%KellBeII> Tifa needs a big fan, she hates the heat too
[2:14:45] <%Aridpython> Alchemist station and bar combo
[2:14:58] <Aussie_Manny> Tifa gets sweaty. She says that a lot.
[2:15:10] <+BinaryFireball> its done better but feels worse
[2:15:32] <%octotasty> when you do texture work, the first thing they teach you is to tell a story that makes sense in the texture.

[2:15:39] <Stillchr> What, you dont think people get attacked by random Buildings in the junkyard?
[2:15:39] <baxterd> its that old game vibes
[2:15:45] <DaKnightWarrior> opens up the imagination.
[2:15:45] <%acridpaladin> i love the ghoul newcaster
[2:15:50] <tolloponik> what is that monster man of a reporter
[2:15:59] <%arkv01> she literally downloaded a bomb
[2:16:04] <rotche_yalla> lel
[2:16:12] <baxterd> SIN

[2:16:48] <Shwepie> Good news, Remake says she was set up and did nothing wrong.
[2:18:00] <castlerock42> You fight the other two in the game, I just don't remember where. It's pretty funny that they don't comment on it.
[2:18:10] <cartakus> What is the "compilation"? All extra games that came out after the first?
[2:18:10] <%kyh9> My biggest question from Remake is whether Roche is indicative of the average level of strength for 3rd Class SOLDIERs, or if he's a weirdo like Cloud
[2:18:13] <+Corydonn> All the Soldiers play battle royale simulators now.
[2:18:38] <+PowerArmorMeow> cloud is just an infantrymen
[2:18:38] <cartakus> Also roach in remake
[2:18:38] <%kyh9> Roche does some NUTTY shit
[2:18:41] <umberhulk_lord> In Remake Reno can tell you're not first class because you would kick his ass effortlessly if you were
[2:19:12] <impartialcredit> blasting off again

[2:19:23] <ThePimpGuin> roche in remake actually helps power scale how strong Cloud really is here
[2:19:23] <%octotasty> I only want one thing in the remake. Sephiroth floating while T-Posing in the library
[2:19:34] <smile64> @umberhulk_lord funny since in the speedrun you one shot him with cross slash
[2:19:34] <ThePimpGuin> he aint 1st

[2:22:43] <%boatzndhoez> @acridpaladin there you go, you love sitting down, you know yourself :)
[2:22:48] <+PowerArmorMeow> jenova = the thing
[2:23:03] <+BinaryFireball> in remake her doubts are there
[2:23:08] <slackerunchained> "Did I mention the planet is Dyin', Cloud?"
[2:23:10] <StaceMcGate> I think its all a revenge thing
[2:23:12] <Coystick> The fact that JC Denton is 23 in Deus Ex upsets me greatly
[2:23:15] <sirtommygunn> feels like she's just supporting Barret honestly
[2:23:16] <snow_bush> She cares about it enough to have a terrorist group operating out of her bar.
[2:23:19] <+King_floppy> she cared enough to latch onto it after she moved to Midgar for whatever reason.
[2:23:20] <+VictorVonLouche> Like remake she seemed against it till shinra destroyed her home.
[2:23:21] <AtomicSheepGhost> you know i didn't know i was a hot mess until plague described it
[2:23:26] <zk_nails> "I'm 20 years old and what is this?"
[2:23:46] <DaKnightWarrior> Revenge
[2:23:53] <tolloponik> it's more of an excuse to destroy shinra
[2:24:01] <StaceMcGate> until you get into the compilation mobile game in which AVALANCHE was a false flag created by Rufus
[2:24:09] <+VictorVonLouche> He latched onto what he thinks is a good reason to fight.
[2:24:18] <%octotasty> Revengealanche
[2:24:22] <+MKUltima> Why are we still here, just to suffer? The planet, its screams, I can still feel it.
[2:24:36] <biglomix> Why I love the Sea Sheaperds, crazy assholes
[2:24:40] <sirtommygunn> its gotta be personal
[2:24:41] <+andrew1ups> Sounds like the left
[2:25:08] <+PleasantLee> barret protects the planet and in advent children finds oil fields and harvests them
[2:25:09] <sirtommygunn> like yeah I understand we're destroying the planet irl but I'm not gonna go do ecoterrorism
[2:25:18] <Iza_kku> i could see tifa not liking shirna for that town shenanigans yeah
[2:25:24] <tolloponik> probably to be part of something and not be left alone I guess
[2:25:30] <%arkv01> yeah tifa is just a revengebot
[2:25:35] <biglomix> Just a harbenger
[2:25:38] <tanarath> Tifa feels like someone waifu that has a few alright motivations.
[2:25:59] <+VictorVonLouche> In a position of, "I can reel them in if they attempt to go too far."
[2:26:06] <biglomix> oh Berret, did you minecraft another school
[2:26:42] <KaiserMario> Wut? Stomp who?
[2:26:48] <+BinaryFireball> people who easily attach
[2:26:48] <Brain_Explodes> IMO Tifa's life got fucked up by Sephiroth but since so far she believes he's dead. She doesn't really have strong emotion against Shinra.
[2:26:50] <+Mekhet09> One moment if you will.
[2:26:51] <tanarath> Then again, maybe Tifa's head is just empty.
[2:26:59] <+askalta> I think she's compelled by survivors guilt to stay with cloud
[2:27:00] <%acridpaladin> one memory pogonaSmug
[2:27:01] <ChungusQuest> Wait, so is the domestic abuser the least fucked up playable character in this game? Or maybe the furry?
[2:27:08] <SadisticAphid60> Remember when I said good morning to you that one time?
[2:27:10] <+King_floppy> Sure, but it's a powerful memory. and nobody else hung out with him like that
[2:27:11] <biglomix> Its more like, "we have nothing to talk about, but that thing"
[2:27:16] <wolfen091> remember that one time we touched weiners in third grade?
[2:27:20] <+BallerSwagBro9k> Oh shit Eli is VCat now? Noice
[2:27:24] <jowi_time> god a I LOVE the BGM
[2:27:24] <+BinaryFireball> I both understand and hate the desire to attach like that to someone else
[2:27:30] <%kyh9> I've had this with friends who reach out to me after I started making money
[2:27:44] <%kyh9> "Remember when we ate food in school" "No"
[2:27:53] <Coystick> Look at Tifa's smug face
[2:28:02] <brexdq> love him
[2:28:11] <saint_mooncheese> retsuvSus
[2:28:16] <+BallerSwagBro9k> I just finished FF7R today and boi did I hate that ending

[2:28:26] <tanarath> Tim... is a good person. He needs therapy.
[2:28:35] <biglomix> contain the crazy
[2:28:35] <cartakus> A super power with a bunch of debuffs
[2:28:42] <+RobertWayneLewis98> First time actually seeing someone play through ff7 lol. This could be good.
[2:28:46] <+Mekhet09> I wish I had that crazy. If I always remembered everything I'd be able to use it to get a better job.
[2:28:49] <+CursedNobleman> that sentence is interesting outta context
[2:28:49] <madiethemagepc> tim rodgers is even more of a cartoon character in my mind than you actually
[2:28:56] <shadepman> wait what’s wrong with tim
[2:29:03] <CaerwynMontale> They would be 13 and 14
[2:29:13] <StaceMcGate> later in disc 2 they reuse these
[2:29:15] <biglomix> @RobertWayneLewis98 it will take 40 parts
[2:29:16] <CaerwynMontale> The Mideel lifestrem
[2:29:17] <StaceMcGate> in cloud's memories

[2:29:24] <Feraligatrmcbum> They're in cloud's mind palace
[2:29:37] <+PleasantLee> young cloud wore a white shirt I think
[2:29:38] <ruleofthespear> Short boy

[2:30:26] <+BinaryFireball> this makes it like ten times worse lol
[2:30:31] <Zakaraz> Cloud w/ rattail
[2:30:37] <+RobertWayneLewis98> Sounds like teens tbf
[2:30:41] <+PowerArmorMeow> cloud is a nobody  who poured his heart out to his crush..
[2:30:46] <+BinaryFireball> I like it when it was base level written fantasy lol
[2:30:54] <+Betofall> cloud isn't like the other girls
[2:30:54] <%TQuick101> "I'm not like those OTHER girls"
[2:30:57] <sirtommygunn> im gonna be the best little murderer!
[2:30:58] <+BinaryFireball> now its tained with realism
[2:31:17] <cartakus> Kinda animu
[2:31:19] <biglomix> Like stage acting
[2:31:25] <baxterd> there's a tangible SQUAREness to this game's animations
[2:31:27] <%kyh9> It makes clear that Cloud is a shitfuck with his body language
[2:31:36] <%kyh9> I miss these little lego models
[2:31:41] <+UncleAWOL> Hello Plague how goes the cat life
[2:31:44] <biglomix> Watch old 60's show and its still stage work,
[2:31:52] <baxterd> like Mario's charades in mario rpg
[2:31:54] <Brain_Explodes> I thought he's also blamed with Tifa getting hurt on Mt. Nibelheim. But Tifa never personally blamed him
[2:31:54] <President_Pariah> Tifa rocking those high heeled sandals
[2:32:03] <ruleofthespear> "I'm going to join the army and be a hero"
[2:32:13] <TheGuesty> he will be THE pokemon master
[2:32:21] <+CursedNobleman> mmn, nostalgia
[2:32:22] <KaiserMario> I'm gonna be, the very best! Like no one ever was!
[2:32:23] <+BallerSwagBro9k> He's gonna become a Pokemon master
[2:32:36] <+PleasantLee> sephiroth is like 19 at this point too
[2:32:40] <%whyskeywolfe> Them referring to a corporate soldier as "the great" is a bit weird.
[2:32:41] <+Mekhet09> You mean he wasn't shoved in your face to make you remember this is FF7 every 10 seconds.
[2:32:56] <President_Pariah> Cloud wants to become a Witcher
[2:33:00] <SadisticAphid60> like ltg
[2:33:03] <+BallerSwagBro9k> @mekhet09 Impossible woolieMIRIN
[2:33:05] <Dunmarkh> Unless you're captain america
[2:33:21] <AdmiralButtloaf> are soldiers Witchers?

[2:34:32] <+King_floppy> Tifa made the papers before him, abeit in the form of AVALANCHE
[2:34:42] <zk_nails> if you got in the paper for that it would be a wanted poster

[2:35:27] <+BallerSwagBro9k> HES SUCH A DWEEB
[2:35:28] <+PleasantLee> you wann get laid or not cloud
[2:35:31] <CaerwynMontale> Cloud was just a confused kid

[2:35:44] <Stillchr> doesnt she feel bad for Cloud?
[2:35:45] <sirtommygunn> fantasizing
[2:35:53] <ThePimpGuin> she is a fighter, maybe she likes the violent asshole type
[2:35:56] <+King_floppy> thats a huge chunk of why Aeris hs taken with Cloud tho too
[2:35:56] <%bettysharkface> plagueNYA
[2:35:59] <+BallerSwagBro9k> @binaryfireball you must be new LUL
[2:35:59] <+PowerArmorMeow> cloud wanted to be a heroine Zack
[2:36:00] <+King_floppy> being a SOLDIER boy
[2:36:04] <Tsunamods> Is it only texture mods on right now? The music feels cleaner somehow tsunam6Hi
[2:36:11] <tanarath> Fair? But her attachment even at this point combined with japanese media suggests it's a crush.
[2:36:12] <+BinaryFireball> @BallerSwagBro9k i am not but this is next level shit lol
[2:36:14] <+CursedNobleman> Huhhm, so you've recovered from the tornado then?
[2:36:14] <villainous_quel> she takes pity on him
[2:36:15] <+PowerArmorMeow> *hero damn auto correct
[2:36:16] <+CursedNobleman> sorta?*
[2:36:18] <Brain_Explodes> Cloud is also the only kid who followed her when she went up Mt. Nibelheim though when all other kids chickened out
[2:36:20] <ChungusQuest> Small town girls gotta hedge their bets
[2:36:23] <cartakus> oooooooof
[2:36:25] <ThePimpGuin> wait wut
[2:36:31] <+RobertWayneLewis98> Spoiler :(
[2:36:32] <tanarath> Not to be confused by japanese people.
[2:36:32] <+BallerSwagBro9k> long not large woolieMIRIN
[2:36:35] <President_Pariah> Maybe Tifa wasn't into Cloud as a young dork but when he shows up as a hot adult she turns manipulative and clingy?
[2:36:36] <PlebianNoob> WAT?
[2:36:36] <CaerwynMontale> She suppressed it
[2:36:43] <castlerock42> And you didn't know he was there to begin with.
[2:36:50] <+walternatorz> I love how shit doesn't work so Barret just climbs up
[2:36:58] <ThePimpGuin> but she has no scar, we can see that glorious mid-drift
[2:36:59] <bepbopdrn> "Yeah, sure, I'm gonna sustain you from now on."
[2:37:02] <+King_floppy> god, Tifa not having a fuckoff huge scar on her model in Remake was actually more upsetting to me than it should have been.
[2:37:22] <CaerwynMontale> Technically it's yep equivalent
[2:37:26] <SadisticAphid60> poverty
[2:37:26] <ruleofthespear> is it dollars or yen
[2:37:27] <CaerwynMontale> yen*
[2:37:37] <CaerwynMontale> so that's like 15
[2:37:44] <+PowerArmorMeow> maybe cure magic heals scars?
[2:37:44] <StaceMcGate> yes
[2:37:44] <ThePimpGuin> probably
[2:37:45] <+D4C_Trice> no
[2:37:45] <%TQuick101> probably
[2:37:45] <tanarath> NO
[2:37:47] <tolloponik> 15 bucks to blow up a reactor
[2:37:48] <sirtommygunn> The first one
[2:37:48] <jowi_time> probably
[2:37:49] <+PleasantLee> not 2nd mission no
[2:37:51] <+BallerSwagBro9k> @king_floppy Right? Like her stomach was uncovered and intact, like wtf
[2:37:52] <ThePimpGuin> but they died during
[2:37:53] <snow_bush> First one? Probably
[2:37:59] <+AmuserName> Probably, but not without losing Jessie or someone else.
[2:38:00] <%arkv01> yes but barret would probably have not made it out alive
[2:38:01] <+VictorVonLouche> Not without casualties
[2:38:01] <KineticZen> What a monster
[2:38:03] <shadepman> has tifa ever been depicted with a scar ever
[2:38:06] <tolloponik> school in Midgar?!
[2:38:11] <tanarath> The first one, a few would have died. The second, no.
[2:38:13] <Dunmarkh> Sounds like a good investment
[2:38:25] <cartakus> Maybe the stab was raised a bit more?
[2:38:30] <CaerwynMontale> He agrees to 2000 for the next one
[2:38:41] <+PowerArmorMeow> @shadepman on model, no never with a scar
[2:38:58] <jowi_time> there are rules?!
[2:39:00] <+CursedNobleman> sleeping on steel grates NotLikeThis
[2:39:11] <person181> time to grind for 90 levels
[2:39:16] <+PowerArmorMeow> @jowi_time yep
[2:39:20] <CaerwynMontale> Time to grind
[2:39:27] <ThePimpGuin> vincent
[2:39:32] <$bloodyheartland> man it's been a while.  I had no idea plague became as vtuber
[2:39:37] <Bi_Noculas> There's mods for this game? There's no pixels!
[2:39:44] <%arkv01> yuffers has a fixed level iirc
[2:39:59] <@Nightbot> Plague is a youtube animator and also streams at https://picarto.tv/Plague . Also: t-shirts! http://goo.gl/lze8QO
[2:40:10] <ThePimpGuin> optional characters levels be different I suppose
[2:40:26] <jowi_time> yeah that's really creeptastic
[2:40:28] <+BallerSwagBro9k> yep
[2:40:33] <person181> the top one might at least get a laugh out of her
[2:40:35] <tanarath> It's aweful
[2:40:35] <%arkv01> lick and smack lips for extra points
[2:40:37] <snow_bush> Look, Tifa is into dorks.
[2:40:39] <cartakus> slow
[2:40:41] <+BallerSwagBro9k> LUL
[2:40:42] <+CursedNobleman> Dont say "It was challenging sleeping next to you." Either. Personal experience.
[2:40:51] <sirtommygunn> romance is just acting creepy in a way the other person likes

[2:44:09] <LunarRemix> I think I got to like the fifth battle on Final Fantasy Tactics without knowing you could change jobs or equipment
[2:44:11] <%Owkono> I read the instruction manual
[2:44:14] <+VictorVonLouche> tbf some games have fucky button layouts
[2:44:17] <leinadtonu> That has happened to me with other games...
[2:44:18] <tolloponik> I believe it would happen
[2:44:28] <President_Pariah> nah they prolly just designed all the tutorials in a bubble and didn't know where they'd get placed in the story
[2:44:29] <shadepman> that’s kinda ableist smh

[2:44:39] <StaceMcGate> I didn't have a memory card for first 2 months of owning a PS1, so I replayed the first 7 hours of this game like 6 times
[2:44:40] <ThePimpGuin> what are these buttons?
[2:44:45] <ThePimpGuin> I have no OK button
[2:44:45] <%Chibi_Whan> never played this game, my whole exposure is from FF7 machinabridged
[2:44:47] <thespaceduck> LUL
[2:44:56] <CaerwynMontale> Aaron from Game Grumps made a whole video about how tutorials are stupid.

[2:44:57] <snow_bush> As someone who works IT? Yes, the people who ask about the "Any Key" do exist.

[2:47:23] <%whyskeywolfe> In other words he's not going to "Pat it up" for this playthough.
[2:47:31] <+VictorVonLouche> This is like proto ff8 nonsense stats with the gp's
[2:47:32] <sirtommygunn> They need to change by 5% per materia if you want me to give a shit when equipping stuff
[2:47:33] <%cooldude69xx> @CaerwynMontale This is the same guy who once said you can stick your head in a beehive and it'll be fine.
[2:47:34] <%Owkono> that's way too much effort
[2:47:36] <+emperordread> Oh no, like old Fire Emblem. Random level up stats is so bad
[2:47:47] <CaerwynMontale> oathLUL
[2:48:18] <+D4C_Trice> I have how a certain perk is required in FE fates to get the best stats per level up

[3:09:53] <+RobertWayneLewis98> Greaser is a slur I think
[3:09:57] <Dunmarkh> Not a cult ranch yet.
[3:10:05] <umberhulk_lord> It's Yuffie's dad
[3:10:19] <CaerwynMontale> Where's the parent's beds?
[3:10:25] <Augus7717> maybe its a prized doll?
[3:10:29] <+polothegreatest> Mario?
[3:10:31] <%JovianGargoyle> kabhaaHulloThere No judgement here.
[3:10:34] <%mountain_megatherium> @RobertWayneLewis98 Did I miss the joke?  Isn't it just the hair products
[3:10:35] <aeravon> Environmental storytelling-> TOILET
[3:10:45] <umberhulk_lord> Might just be one of those weird dolls old lady's have sometimes
[3:11:01] <Iza_kku> gotta be baseball
[3:11:17] <+RobertWayneLewis98> @mountain_megatherium I think it’s said to Italians because of the stereotype that they use a lot of hair products.
[3:11:28] <%Owkono> they sleep in the toilet
[3:11:43] <umberhulk_lord> I like the baby toy they never threw out of gave away, very realistic
[3:11:48] <CaerwynMontale> No room for the parents
[3:11:59] <tanarath> Behind the flag?
[3:12:01] <shadepman> i wish i had parents like johnny’s
[3:12:04] <+jorgamund> parents sleep upstairs
[3:12:33] <Brain_Explodes> yep, I put a "Toilet" sign in front of my bathroom too
[3:12:36] <%Engwithan_Elder_God> damn
[3:12:51] <ruleofthespear> I'm starting to think this place is a downer

[3:14:15] <justcallmebobplease> @TQuick101 How rude!
[3:14:20] <%impulse255dj> @justcallmebobplease Thank you for the gift, very generous of you. <3
[3:14:22] <StaceMcGate> I've never understood thios
[3:14:25] <StaceMcGate> this*
[3:14:26] <lotharrio> Man that's a sad ending.
[3:14:36] <CaerwynMontale> oathGasp
[3:14:40] <squareofthelightones> I dont remember this part
[3:14:43] <CaerwynMontale> realvrRainbow
[3:14:51] <+jorgamund> suicide pact?
[3:15:39] <%Traximus_V> isnt there a punch sound effect
[3:15:55] <lotharrio> Or are they fighting the ghosts?!
[3:15:55] <Downgraded286> interesting
[3:16:01] <Downgraded286> any steals or anything?
[3:16:14] <DaKnightWarrior> nice detail
[3:16:28] <CaerwynMontale> Didn't know that
[3:16:31] <CaerwynMontale> Nice
[3:16:46] <+RobertWayneLewis98> Ghosts? Hmm
[3:16:46] <shadepman> that’s pretty smart
[3:17:13] <Downgraded286> your knowledge of this game may surpass even my own, heh
[3:17:20] <+PleasantLee> hes saving up for a speedboat
[3:17:22] <tolloponik> better rent
[3:17:26] <CaerwynMontale> I feel that way on the train too. People are so inconsiderate on trains
[3:17:26] <vonmaultke> he works like an Amazon employee
[3:17:44] <biglomix> I smell a bitch
[3:17:45] <+BinaryFireball> middle manager
[3:18:05] <mihokspawn> He was probablly going to Don Corneo's for some fun
[3:18:18] <justcallmebobplease> He's pretty brave for 1/3 the size of the big guy talkin' shit.
[3:18:23] <%BallerSwagBro9k> cmonBruh
[3:18:38] <%TQuick101> "devoted employee"
[3:18:38] <ThePimpGuin> I make 35k a year mr black man, I know whats right and your violence is wrong!
[3:18:42] <Iza_kku> leave that man's seed alone barret
[3:18:54] <kjb343> this fucking guy of all people gets development in the remake
[3:19:01] <StaceMcGate> only Cid says cunt, lets be real
[3:19:04] <lotharrio> Also depends on the location. UK and Australia never cared.
[3:19:08] <%Void_The_Dark> Yo. I'm late to the stream. plagueWave
[3:19:10] <squareofthelightones> when I read that employee line during my playthrough I thought it was Barret saying that, so I thought he was being "covert" by pretending to work for shinra
[3:19:20] <+askalta> don't open those floodgates
[3:19:28] <Dunmarkh> LUL NotLikeThis
[3:19:29] <el_flako_killer> jajajaja!
[3:19:30] <Coystick> Cunt is a sacred word
[3:19:50] <+BinaryFireball> nope
[3:20:03] <+BinaryFireball> gas costs and empty trains
[3:20:18] <+BinaryFireball> during rush hour they connect more cars
[3:20:28] <ThePimpGuin> Cunt should be reserved for politicians and billionaires
[3:20:37] <morcego_cinzento_arts> thhere a joke about cunt in the Harvey Quinn cartoon, some super villain says it live on TV and everybody freakks out
[3:20:45] <StaceMcGate> this guy are sick
[3:20:48] <law240> the trains stop at the reactors
[3:20:50] <CaerwynMontale> But everything runs on Mako energy not gad
[3:20:52] <StrangeCoincidence> has plague played super mario brothers for the NES yet?
[3:20:54] <CaerwynMontale> gas*
[3:21:12] <law240> at least for the first reactor
[3:21:26] <StrangeCoincidence> but it uses mako energy
[3:21:32] <StrangeCoincidence> just stuff souls into the engine
[3:21:36] <Coystick> Ya they say cunt in super mario brothers for the NES
[3:21:46] <+BinaryFireball> mako bb
[3:21:46] <zk_nails> ain't got time when the planet's dying
[3:21:49] <+RobertWayneLewis98> Is this not the future?
[3:21:58] <shadepman> what if it’s a bullet train
[3:22:02] <jbrachob> bullet train?
[3:22:04] <person181> because it's a 6 minute walk
[3:22:04] <+jorgamund> inertia doesn't make for fun story beats though
[3:22:07] <+BinaryFireball> think like a subway
[3:22:09] <+Axellogic> oh theres an Eli stream today
[3:22:20] <+Gamblor69> Things like the London Underground are like that
[3:22:35] <ThePimpGuin> knights of the round?!?!
[3:22:40] <+Axellogic> Those monitors look so uncomfortable to look at
[3:22:48] <ThePimpGuin> from hobo in the london underground
[3:23:09] <morcego_cinzento_arts> i mean you are talking to one of cloud side bitches
[3:23:20] <+RobertWayneLewis98> No she punch you
[3:23:22] <CaerwynMontale> I want the polygon figurines oathSmile
[3:23:29] <+Viny_Mars> There's a mod with better chibi models
[3:23:49] <ThePimpGuin> poppycock someone blew it
[3:24:23] <ruleofthespear> nice
[3:24:33] <CaerwynMontale> Bet this gave epilepsy sufferers hell
[3:25:59] <Dunmarkh> Jessie put the bomb in that guy's rectum
[3:26:56] <+Axellogic> but she has 4 personalities
[3:26:57] <+onlystrykerfan> Cloud rules
[3:27:37] <+RobertWayneLewis98> they rotate
[3:27:51] <%mountain_megatherium> She rolled its fine...
[3:28:01] <%mountain_megatherium> Just at 60 mph
[3:28:41] <MrMatternot> 60 kph
[3:28:47] <ThePimpGuin> she has built in air bags
[3:28:51] <ThePimpGuin> she fine
[3:29:09] <CaerwynMontale> I always thought that combining to one character was weird
[3:29:17] <TheGuesty> Plague stop... you are making my bran hurt
[3:29:38] <CaerwynMontale> I mean I know why,  but it's still weird
[3:29:42] <netarms> endless battle
[3:29:58] <Downgraded286> I always fuck around
[3:30:03] <+RobertWayneLewis98> are you addicted? I thought you were almost done lol
[3:30:12] <agsiar2> holy shit a plague stream
[3:30:20] <agsiar2> first time i catch one
[3:30:25] <+onlystrykerfan> It's like string shot in pokemon
[3:30:28] <%Void_The_Dark> splow
[3:30:43] <VelstadtTheRoyalAnus> hey how's the family of yours doing?
[3:30:47] <%Explodincatz> its not Slow "magic" its Slow "physical"
[3:30:47] <lotharrio> Spell-like ability, to borrow from DnD
[3:30:48] <MrMatternot> C, it is either one sprite represents the party or the conga line of characters
[3:31:07] <shadepman> goddamn tifa’s stacked
[3:31:29] <agsiar2> so is eli's internet now not shit or how come he's able to stream?
[3:31:38] <sun312772> You a Vtuber now you degenerate ?
[3:31:43] <CaerwynMontale> Fast battle screen load
[3:31:46] <Iza_kku> ha ha, honkers
[3:32:01] <UnsteadyFunk> a real set of badonkers
[3:32:01] <morcego_cinzento_arts> twin materias
[3:32:45] <TheButtravage> @PlagueOfGripes My sister brought covid home for Christmas, hope you are doing well.
[3:32:50] <ThePimpGuin> set All now
[3:32:51] <Kizmmit> when i was a kid there was a rumour that by doing enough of those endless soldier fights it would unlock zack
[3:32:54] <ThePimpGuin> dont forget again
[3:32:55] <Samex_Comex> Right one bonk left one donk
[3:32:57] <MrMatternot> Eli, I hope your family is healthier... if not better
[3:33:02] <agsiar2> nice. i only recently started following you on twitch, mostly because i stayed away from it for many, many years
[3:33:14] <agsiar2> hope you'll stream more
[3:33:24] <agsiar2> obviously, if health and internet allows
[3:33:29] <morcego_cinzento_arts> be back later, need to make dinner
[3:33:32] <VelstadtTheRoyalAnus> What were the contents of the comments of the last video that were so bad you had to cleanse them all?
[3:33:35] <sharpened_hammer> I do remember when you forgot to equip it.
[3:33:42] <TimetodiveLTX> my guy is this the PC original soundtrack
[3:33:55] <TimetodiveLTX> christ
[3:34:01] <TimetodiveLTX> i don't like any of what i'm hearing rn
[3:34:02] <%Void_The_Dark> Uh oh. They see. Surely it's time to run away now. (continues to approach guard/bots)
[3:34:13] <RetributionP> choak jerk
[3:34:14] <+onlystrykerfan> DAVID CARRIDINE
[3:34:15] <%mountain_megatherium> Oh, my
[3:34:20] <shadepman> barret is now a [BIG SHOT]
[3:34:21] <%JovianGargoyle> laavisOwo
[3:34:35] <agsiar2> a BIG MONEY SHOT
[3:34:36] <tanarath> What do they give?
[3:34:47] <sharpened_hammer> Valuable EXP and AP
[3:35:12] <UnsteadyFunk> Lightning is super good early game. So many things are weak to it.
[3:35:24] <%JovianGargoyle> You ever play Sly Cooper? You'd probably dig the soundtrack.
[3:36:22] <+onlystrykerfan> That one is so fucking funny
[3:36:25] <+DrTribal> omg i need that in my life
[3:37:01] <+onlystrykerfan> Snapcube
[3:37:10] <Stillchr> we talking Fan Dub Sonic?
[3:37:10] <shadepman> sly cooper deserved to be a gaming icon goddammit
[3:37:17] <hector_ib> potato
[3:37:19] <+genobeam125> Scary timing, I just went back and listened to that stuff yesterday
[3:37:20] <~PlagueOfGripes> https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-6G7J1L8vQw&list=PL-QgmqAlQTgxpwUtiOuQUTMzJrXRSjfhC
[3:37:24] <Schuhart> The Sonic Riders one is nice. I enjoy it a lot
[3:37:32] <+genobeam125> will do
[3:37:33] <CaerwynMontale> Oh God the Sonic riders is hilarious
[3:37:57] <%Waffle_Stache> plagueTaps plagueTaps
[3:37:57] <%JovianGargoyle> Will do. derpyd3Yandere
[3:37:58] <Stillchr> the quest for CLick 2
[3:38:04] <+DrTribal> its really good
[3:38:14] <Schuhart> The Bird gang are wholesome and only want to be friends
[3:38:15] <+genobeam125> got in late, why are the musicians drunk?
[3:38:16] <person181> it continues to follow their sonic cannon
[3:38:17] <+D4C_Trice> I love Alfred
[3:38:23] <+Nitsua18> plague are you planning on doing a full playthrough?
[3:38:32] <+InvisiblessedReptile> FF7 is so good, nice to see you playing it
[3:38:35] <DeltaD36> amateur'd
[3:38:37] <+Dr_Ramhorn> Hey Plague how's it been going?
[3:38:38] <%Aridpython> They released part 2 of sonic destruction like 3 days ago
[3:38:47] <DeltaD36> he's southern I guess now
[3:38:55] <Daxalog> Some people say it like that
[3:38:55] <%boatzndhoez> heck is that
[3:38:55] <%Void_The_Dark> Runs into lasers. Fights more robtots.
[3:39:36] <%WinWinRobin> that's the kind of mistake people learning English make, falsely applying abbreviations like that
[3:39:43] <CaerwynMontale> Probably took less Japanese characters to fit that box
[3:39:54] <%Void_The_Dark> Swoon the Baret
[3:39:57] <@Nightbot> Plague is a youtube animator and also streams at https://picarto.tv/Plague . Also: t-shirts! http://goo.gl/lze8QO
[3:40:07] <Dunmarkh> go down on Barrett
[3:40:08] <shadepman> this game definitely deserves a relocalization
[3:40:16] <UnsteadyFunk> Just going rather than looking would be seen as confident and brave I guess
[3:40:21] <+easilykillablejeff> I'm playing this too, and I've seen the cutoff text box multiple times.
[3:40:27] <Zakaraz> country accent can be summed by dropping as many characters as possible. ain't no one got patience for all those extra words
[3:40:56] <%Void_The_Dark> Surprisingly, giving Barrett the chills also makes him hot.
[3:40:56] <%airofrelief> airofrelief subscribed with Prime. 
[3:40:57] <SuperVaderMan> gross
[3:40:57] <+onlystrykerfan> He took the liberty of making it cringe as fuck
[3:40:58] <DaKnightWarrior> lytPALM
[3:40:59] <HeroSolaire> i played ff7 recently the ps1 version with reinstranslation, still think its the version that looks the best, all pc mods end up still looking so weird
[3:41:00] <+genobeam125> but why?
[3:41:05] <UnsteadyFunk> why use lot word when few word do trick
[3:41:25] <%Explodincatz> happens every time
[3:41:50] <%Void_The_Dark> it sure is
[3:41:51] <%Engwithan_Elder_God> Just a little.
[3:41:57] <%daveronald> grip for giants
[3:41:57] <+RenoDeGeneric> GiGANTIC diamond plate
[3:41:59] <+genobeam125> it's shinra-made
[3:42:11] <SuperVaderMan> Tifa Smash
[3:42:20] <VelstadtTheRoyalAnus> Is this the FF7 translation where Tifa calls someone a ret*rd?
[3:42:21] <%WinWinRobin> they wanted a very particular feel for people walking barefoot or on socks
[3:42:30] <+genobeam125> that was a trust exercise
[3:42:57] <HeroSolaire> god I hate how the remake is so lengthy and has so many dumb slow corridors
[3:43:01] <Samex_Comex> Mark my words you will read my Wedge is the hero of FF7 fanfic someday
[3:43:53] <Kizmmit> how much longer will the stream go for roughly?
[3:44:05] <+genobeam125> back to the ocean with you!
[3:44:13] <DaKnightWarrior> I miss pre rendered backgrounds. they are so beautiful.
[3:44:13] <UnsteadyFunk> Jesse is distracted by her thirst for Cloud and that's why she can't join you in combat.
[3:44:17] <lotharrio> Jesse is a cravenly coward. Canon.
[3:44:42] <+genobeam125> but then you wouldn't get to see the seahorses
[3:45:33] <Iza_kku> choke up on it

[3:47:26] <+genobeam125> hopefully the slide survived in Remake
[3:47:48] <%Aridpython> Final fantasy 7 tony hawk. Grind the rim of the reactor to collect the skate letters
[3:48:07] <sharpened_hammer> Yep. The grindy spot early iirc
[3:48:29] <HeroSolaire> funny enough there is snowboarding in the game
[3:48:35] <HeroSolaire> instead of skating
[3:48:49] <+genobeam125> FF7, break?!
[3:49:11] <HeroSolaire> maybe a few years later and we would have got a Cloud skateboarding segment
[3:49:22] <Downgraded286> my first playthrough, way back when I was a kid, I never realized I had to go to Gold Saucer and go to prison
[3:49:26] <HeroSolaire> after tony hawk blew up
[3:49:29] <Downgraded286> I didn't care about Gold Saucer, so I never went
[3:49:30] <+DrTribal> im glad i caught it live then
[3:49:30] <+Axellogic> Use Save editor to level down you can power level even more
[3:49:34] <VelstadtTheRoyalAnus> Is this music from FF5 (the machine area)? I've played that game twice but only played a small bit of 7
[3:49:39] <+genobeam125> oh no
[3:49:45] <Downgraded286> so I got stuck for weeks... wound up reaching level 70 something
[3:50:01] <+genobeam125> Cloud has tinnitus
[3:50:26] <Downgraded286> I too suffer from tinnitus :(
[3:50:34] <%QueequegTheater> "You seem like a huge dork right now, Cloud"
[3:51:24] <Downgraded286> hey where's the guard scorpion? this reactor doesn't have one? Kappa
[3:51:47] <%Spadoinkle> Cheer100 Tried going back to this on the vita recently. Still love it, but just couldn't with the ATB system.
[3:51:58] <%QueequegTheater> psaJpeg psaJpeg psaJpeg psaJpeg
[3:52:30] <%Spadoinkle> Too fast for me. No problem as a child, now too old.
[3:52:41] <VelstadtTheRoyalAnus> Went with the default character names instead of the opportunity to change them to names of characters from The Thing to fit your story theory?
[3:52:52] <VelstadtTheRoyalAnus> for fun of course
[3:53:08] <+D4C_Trice> FF12 was kind of like mmo hotkeys and programs
[3:53:17] <%QueequegTheater> Which FF game has your favorite story and which one has your favorite combat system?
[3:53:40] <+genobeam125> I wouldn't have minded the old combat system, just with some real depth added
[3:53:47] <+D4C_Trice> I kind of wish I had the party AI command list like 12 for my party in FF7 remake
[3:53:49] <shadepman> ffxv has underrated combat tbh
[3:53:50] <HeroSolaire> the remake combat tho is a bit underwhelmimg in a sense u just need to dodge heal and hit, there barrier and effect spells are really weak
[3:54:05] <%QueequegTheater> @shadepman you can beat most fights literally holding down the auto attack button
[3:54:35] <HeroSolaire> ffxv has the dmc2 combat of the franchise
[3:54:36] <Daxalog> Hit em with the Parasite Eve sphere.
[3:54:53] <+skyshinecrusader> yeah like paracite eve
[3:55:03] <%QueequegTheater> 7R's combat feels too easy until Hard Mode
[3:55:17] <VelstadtTheRoyalAnus> What remaining hope I had in Squeenix went down to negative numbers after the president's Happy New Years letter where he goes on about the Metaverse and investing in NFTs and Blockchain games or whatever the fuck he was on about
[3:55:28] <+SilentSlacker> dummiMiss
[3:55:28] <rekinom> Is this the orchestrated music or the original midis?
[3:55:31] <+genobeam125> this should have been the final boss
[3:55:39] <+genobeam125> bring it back when escaping the northern crater
[3:55:56] <Shwepie> FF7R feels like it powers from Kingdom Hearts for some of its combat. Maybe that's just me though.
[3:55:59] <+genobeam125> it hurts me.
[3:56:00] <rekinom> Ohhh, was gonna say, it sounded different but really good still
[3:56:01] <%QueequegTheater> I feel like if you're trusting Squenix for anything except Yoko Taro or YoshiP's teams you're setting yourself up for failure
[3:56:45] <drowsy_ttv> watched your ruining the original video it was a really good time enjoyed it a lot
[3:56:50] <+SilentSlacker> hcjGun
[3:57:15] <+casualelite> casualelite subscribed with Prime. They've subscribed for 2 months! Hope you are doing ok Eli
[3:57:31] <%QueequegTheater> There's going to be bullshit attached
[3:57:31] <CaerwynMontale> Lackluster
[3:57:37] <%Explodincatz> drivel
[3:57:47] <+D4C_Trice> if it's not Yoshi P they're going to disappoint
[3:57:54] <%StridentSong> It's a coin flip with the coin weighted towards something bad
[3:57:56] <Iza_kku> bearded lady
[3:58:01] <%cooldude69xx> I'm concerned it'll be FF14-2 in all but gameplay
[3:58:03] <LunarRemix> NEO: The World Ends With You was pretty good.
[3:58:04] <+Axellogic> Well Unless FF16 is a trashfire YoshiP will definitely be moving up in the company
[3:58:09] <CaerwynMontale> acrobatics
[3:58:20] <%QueequegTheater> @Axellogic He's already on the Board of Directors
[3:58:27] <LunarRemix> I know you have no interest in that franchise it's the original was very good and so was the sequel, "despite" Nomura
[3:58:27] <drowsy_ttv> this sounds like an amazing show omg
[3:58:27] <%QueequegTheater> Literally can't move up more
[3:58:32] <+genobeam125> I thought that's what the giant seltzer bottle was for?
[3:58:36] <+walternatorz> are you suggesting you won't find this entertaining?
[3:58:40] <rekinom> Is the diarhea also on fire
[3:58:41] <+BinaryFireball> i love when I walk back into this sorta thing
[3:58:41] <DaKnightWarrior> lytKEK
[3:58:42] <%boatzndhoez> LUL stop it
[3:58:51] <%QueequegTheater> And they named that clown show "Marvel's Avengers"
[3:58:58] <%king_wragles> What.... what are we talking about?
[3:59:00] <%acridpaladin> thats horrifying but god would i laugh
[3:59:00] <%Explodincatz> and its all drawn Family Guy Style
[3:59:01] <%Dakuu75> Your mind is a magical place plague. <3
[3:59:03] <+Axellogic> What he cant steal ceo?
[3:59:04] <VelstadtTheRoyalAnus> ba dum tish
[3:59:06] <%QueequegTheater> @king_wragles Square Enix
[3:59:16] <tolloponik> @QueequegTheater add Forspoken to that list
[3:59:20] <+genobeam125> "Clown car burst into flames - 43 clowns dead"
[3:59:25] <Augus7717> also the circus chief is busy selling NFTs the entire time
[3:59:26] <GurrenGyaru> Do i just have bad taste for likign the way the remake went? D:
[3:59:27] <+SilentSlacker> oldClown hcjTrash
[3:59:30] <DaKnightWarrior> Stopping fire with shit is too funny to think about.
[3:59:31] <tolloponik> and tomb raider
[3:59:48] <%QueequegTheater> Man, imagine if FFXIV was allowed to spend any of the money it actually makes
[3:59:49] <lotharrio> That sounds right.
[3:59:52] <Iza_kku> everyone else is slipping and shitting and on fire
[3:59:59] <%cooldude69xx> How much of his team for FF14 is involved in 16? Do we know?
[4:00:00] <VelstadtTheRoyalAnus> I will always remember we lost the follow up to Deus Ex: Mankind Divided because of Marvel's Avengers
[4:00:02] <+D4C_Trice> Yoko Taro is driving the clown car but he's not on fire
[4:00:17] <@Nightbot> Plague is a youtube animator and also streams at https://picarto.tv/Plague . Also: t-shirts! http://goo.gl/lze8QO
[4:00:18] <andiwaffles> I tried to play X-2 the other month and it made me want to die
[4:00:22] <%cooldude69xx> @D4C_Trice The fire is a metaphor
[4:00:26] <sharpened_hammer> I wish that had been less than a minute. That would have been a GREAT clip.
[4:00:26] <tanarath> They have an electronics division, even an insurance division.
[4:00:28] <%QueequegTheater> @D4C_Trice Someone paid him $5 and he said "Sure fuck it"
[4:00:38] <Augus7717> yoshida is producing it and they have the combat guy from DMC5 and the Heavensward writer but thats all i know
[4:00:41] <+Axellogic> Look at that not a giant hologram
[4:00:41] <+dantejoestar21> @cooldude69xx from what I heard, a decent number of people who worked on Heavensward are doing 16
[4:00:56] <tanarath> Ironically, YoshiP is the only reason they're still solvant.
[4:01:00] <+genobeam125> It's nice having him walk out in person
[4:01:04] <LunarRemix> It wouldn't make sense for the president to actually show up within Barret's shooting range
[4:01:09] <Kizmmit> barrett could just kill him
[4:01:10] <+BinaryFireball> here in the meat
[4:01:17] <%Dakuu75> seems like a good way to get shot
[4:01:22] <%QueequegTheater> If you don't like MMOs but liked the remake, you still owe your enjoyment to FFXIV
[4:01:23] <Augus7717> i walked here with my rich shoes to sneer at you in person
[4:01:25] <+BinaryFireball> makes him come off as brave or powerful here
[4:01:31] <%cooldude69xx> @cooldude69xx I also heard one of the combat designers on DMC 5 is involved. Personally I have high hopes
[4:01:37] <+BinaryFireball> or arrogant lol
[4:01:47] <VelstadtTheRoyalAnus> He gives no fucks if they just shot him in the head
[4:02:02] <%Explodincatz> or mocking him
[4:02:12] <ArashlTempesta> "remember when I asked for that raise?"
[4:02:13] <tanarath> mostly arrogant, although the holographic bots make him seem arrogant too.
[4:02:15] <aMonkeyOnABike> mocking politeness?
[4:02:16] <+walternatorz> I feel like they could have added an ellipses to it
[4:02:22] <Iza_kku> wouldn't he have no idea who cloud was even
[4:02:25] <DaKnightWarrior> Shoot him Barret.
[4:02:29] <jowi_time> how does shinra know him??!
[4:02:42] <VelstadtTheRoyalAnus> It's like Gus Fring when he walked into the gang opening fire on them hands up as a power move and it worked
[4:02:45] <+onlystrykerfan> wow spoilers
[4:02:45] <+D4C_Trice> shinra programming makes him respect the chain of command probably
[4:02:46] <vonmaultke> acknowledging their previous relationship
[4:02:49] <andiwaffles> I guess he would know cloud if he was actually 1st class
[4:03:02] <%QueequegTheater> I feel like the main reason they did the hologram is to give a reason Barrett doesn't literally kill him right here
[4:03:13] <%cooldude69xx> SEPHIROTH?! I heard he's super cool!
[4:03:27] <+genobeam125> yeah, but what if Sephiroth was here?
[4:03:36] <VelstadtTheRoyalAnus> CHRIS PRATT as SEPHIROTH? He's so cool!
[4:03:40] <%lemoan> Sephiroth? Never heard of him.
[4:03:48] <%cooldude69xx> @genobeam125 This scene would be so much better with sephiroth
[4:03:51] <kjb343> good ol seperiath, love that guy
[4:03:54] <+genobeam125> There's actually a diner close by
[4:04:22] <crowdcontrolpatrol> chris pratt as barret sounds dope
[4:04:23] <VelstadtTheRoyalAnus> John Sephiroth is the name
[4:04:28] <%cooldude69xx> Whenever sephiroth isn't onscreen, the audience should be asking "where's sephiroth?"
[4:04:30] <Shwepie> He probably believes they have zero chance of succeeding so being polite/respectful costs him nothing or allows him to stroke his ego by feeling above them.
[4:04:31] <+D4C_Trice> Why are you here president shinra? to laugh at you
[4:04:33] <+yoshkosh20> what a melodramatic asshole
[4:04:40] <%QueequegTheater> But could Master Chief beat Sephiroth
[4:04:43] <%lemoan> @crowdcontrolpatrol it really doesn't lol
[4:04:46] <%Aridpython> Shows how little of a threat he thinks they are
[4:04:46] <VelstadtTheRoyalAnus> Ryan Gosling would be a better fit as Barrett imo
[4:04:58] <tanarath> It's almost like this kind of person is flawed.
[4:05:00] <DaKnightWarrior> yep
[4:05:22] <Iza_kku> robot has the clapper installed
[4:05:24] <ShibuyaTomato> it's like the clapper
[4:05:27] <%Explodincatz> hes a good robo doggy
[4:05:28] <Iza_kku> exactly
[4:05:31] <InvertThief> I don't know what was plague I feel uncomfortable. Ey you'll be alright  <-- I plan on making that a notification for my phone
[4:05:34] <zerointelligence000> doesn't airbuster imply this robot fights air?
[4:05:39] <+genobeam125> He's more of a dustbuster
[4:05:58] <shadepman> does a gunbuster fight guns?
[4:05:58] <+genobeam125> for sonic to rip off
[4:05:58] <UnsteadyFunk> He's certainly no Gunbuster.
[4:05:59] <tanarath> Plague, he's too rich to know how science works.
[4:06:00] <+Axellogic> I actually like most of the airbuster remake theme, though It could use less of the chanting makes it more grandiose than needed
[4:06:13] <lotharrio> Then Barrett just shoots him.
[4:06:14] <Downgraded286> how do you know he's not expecting Air Buster to get a bunch of EXP upon killing them?
[4:06:17] <%QueequegTheater> "Reno installed this sled so he could look cool"
[4:06:21] <rekinom> Please Daddy Shinra uwu
[4:06:27] <Downgraded286> I suppose then you could say he extracted information from their dead bodies
[4:06:40] <VelstadtTheRoyalAnus> He fights air because it takes away from the pollution they want to mass produce
[4:06:40] <smile64> having a giant heidegger hologram in the background is definitely a plus in the remake fight
[4:06:45] <+genobeam125> I like how he's programmed to let people finish their conversations.
[4:06:59] <rekinom> God I love the guitar riff
[4:07:06] <%QueequegTheater> coxJam
[4:07:08] <Iza_kku> bust on him with your big shot barret

[4:08:25] <+Axellogic> what a fight
[4:08:25] <%Explodincatz> fast fight jeez
[4:08:25] <%JovianGargoyle> MrDestructoid Damn boi
[4:08:26] <%QueequegTheater> Man I forgot just how early Airbuster is
[4:08:26] <Downgraded286> yeah, this guy has like a 4x pre-emptive weakness as opposed to the standard 2x
[4:08:30] <+SilentSlacker> oldBanger

[4:09:21] <%lemoan> Tifa: Can't you DO something?      Barret: .....Nah...
[4:09:43] <zerointelligence000> guys atleast look for a piper or a ladder
[4:09:47] <shadepman> i generally like to be underleveled in rpgs cause the challenge is more fun
[4:09:55] <Coystick> "She's the one who needs your big shot"
[4:10:00] <Coystick> There I did it for you
[4:10:02] <%Aridpython> eav4K say it anyway
[4:10:12] <VelstadtTheRoyalAnus> Cloud and Tifa HOT SECKS scene
[4:10:22] <+genobeam125> God, I hope there are some soft FLOWERS down there to break this fall
[4:10:29] <+Gamblor69> I feel that
[4:10:36] <+RobertWayneLewis98> relatable
[4:10:54] <CaerwynMontale> So who is talking to him?
[4:10:59] <+CursedNobleman> do cats burp?
[4:11:03] <%Engwithan_Elder_God> LUL
[4:11:04] <Samex_Comex> Wait back then?
[4:11:18] <zk_nails> yeah... that was the only thing that made it weird.
[4:11:19] <+genobeam125> Those are some damn cushy flowers. Saving Cloud from a fall like that.

[4:11:24] <CaerwynMontale> Zack?

[4:12:11] <+RenoDeGeneric> You made the hole bigger
[4:12:27] <VelstadtTheRoyalAnus> What if they landed in corpse flowers and rafflesias, and those were the flowers Aerif liked to grow?
[4:12:28] <%Explodincatz> and this female hasnt read the script
[4:12:29] <+RenoDeGeneric> he's a SOLDIER
[4:12:32] <zerointelligence000> it's all that SOLDIER training

[4:14:02] <+Axellogic> This is where she fucked Zack
[4:14:08] <chuca77> the slum slam pig
[4:14:12] <+genobeam125> you don't need to, she knows
[4:14:14] <$studleydoorite> she was the slum drunk, selling flowers
[4:14:14] <Dlent_> Both could be true
[4:14:37] <+D4C_Trice> the only game that works with the dumb option is persona 4
[4:14:38] <VelstadtTheRoyalAnus> If this game is just The Thing, which character is Wilford Brimley?
[4:14:49] <squashylemon> why is plague a furry
[4:14:52] <Coystick> HEADBOOBLE
[4:14:54] <+genobeam125> Oh, I thought it was a sleep materia
[4:15:05] <%QueequegTheater> nodders
[4:15:14] <+genobeam125> "It doesn't do anything, this 4x Cut"
[4:15:18] <$studleydoorite> plague is a furry because he's a little purple farm cat
[4:15:23] <+RobertWayneLewis98> whatcha talkin bout plague?
[4:15:27] <zerointelligence000> cloudsplaining
[4:15:40] <+CursedNobleman> cloud needs to give her a materia tutorial
[4:15:46] <$Vampireinarm> i like how her dress is just pants in these small models
[4:15:54] <+genobeam125> nah, she's fun
[4:16:05] <smile64> that's cause you equipped it to your hair and not your weapon (or dead fantasy style jam it in your arms)
[4:16:07] <+RenoDeGeneric> which is why she's great. Shrinemaidens are wack
[4:16:19] <%QueequegTheater> Nuns aren't allowed to be so thick
[4:16:22] <+genobeam125> Just like Cloud's not emo, and Barret is actually a character with screen time.
[4:16:22] <CaerwynMontale> I wonder, how did Ifalga get all the way from the northern continent to Midgar before dying?
[4:16:24] <Quinnotetiquan> @PlagueOfGripes You tried New Threat mod?
[4:16:33] <+PleasantLee> AeriS
[4:16:34] <UnsteadyFunk> She was great in the remake. She's such a dork.
[4:16:37] <+genobeam125> Aeriths
[4:16:39] <DaKnightWarrior> I hate that the compilation tried to make her an angel.

[4:17:20] <shadepman> aerith is canon
[4:17:20] <andiwaffles> ahahaha
[4:17:23] <+TenaciousZodd> I don't come on twitch often but you're cool plague that's all
[4:17:23] <%QueequegTheater> He's such a fucking dork
[4:17:32] <+genobeam125> He thinks he's so cool though
[4:17:33] <LunarRemix> She's noding
[4:17:41] <SuperVaderMan> we got a badass over here
[4:17:50] <%QueequegTheater> QueequegTheater is paying forward the Gift they got from metalliec to TenaciousZodd! 
[4:17:50] <%QueequegTheater> QueequegTheater gifted a Tier 3 sub to TenaciousZodd! This is their first Gift Sub in the channel! 
[4:18:01] <VelstadtTheRoyalAnus> Æarfith
[4:18:05] <tolloponik> I like how in the remake people can't decide how to say her name either
[4:18:07] <+genobeam125> She was just laughing at his hair
[4:18:10] <DaKnightWarrior> lytKEK chump cloud
[4:18:17] <CaerwynMontale> Phony! You're a phony!
[4:18:23] <%TenaciousZodd> @QueequegTheater Thanks for the gift sub!
[4:18:38] <%QueequegTheater> No problemo. I'm just glad you're okay after the tornado and all that, man.
[4:19:08] <squashylemon> did plague cause that tornado?
[4:19:28] <+RobertWayneLewis98> those arms are disgusting
[4:19:33] <andiwaffles> this real, actual badass
[4:19:47] <+PleasantLee> can you find the ghosts?
[4:19:49] <%sinfullsaint> sinfullsaint is paying forward the Gift they got from WinWinRobin to the community! 
[4:19:49] <%sinfullsaint> sinfullsaint is gifting 1 Tier 1 Subs to PlagueOfGripes's community! They've gifted a total of 1 in the channel! 
[4:19:50] <%sinfullsaint> sinfullsaint gifted a Tier 1 sub to octavousjamster! 
[4:20:36] <%QueequegTheater> I really enjoyed Rude in Remake. I think he might have been my favorite part of the game (other than horny reasons)
[4:21:13] <%Aridpython> “Bend over Cloud” eavYouveBeenABadBoy
[4:21:18] <ArashlTempesta> majinoNeko majinoNeko
[4:21:24] <squashylemon> is he about to porn cloud?
[4:21:41] <+PleasantLee> I could never get these barrels right
[4:21:55] <Daxalog> Dont have a cool cutscene fight here!
[4:22:00] <ArashlTempesta> dont dirty the soil with your blood, get out of here
[4:22:15] <Daxalog> What even are Turks? Are they super humans as well?
[4:22:18] <tolloponik> I like they way he fights in the remake it's very technical compared to his personality
[4:22:22] <person181> toss the corpse on the flowers to help them grow
[4:22:28] <CaerwynMontale> I like how everyone who played the game and watched advent children went "The FLOWERS!?" in the church scene
[4:22:40] <+PleasantLee> cloud was a shinra goon, he probably had heard of them atleast
[4:22:41] <%QueequegTheater> I mean, Reno is clearly acting in command of the soldiers, there's a lot you can infer just from that alone
[4:23:03] <Dunmarkh> @daxalog they're from Turkey
[4:23:11] <Samex_Comex> They look like they are laughing
[4:23:11] <+RobertWayneLewis98> japan doing japan things
[4:23:16] <tolloponik> 90's Japanese evil man
[4:23:23] <person181> "if he's not pretty how will we sell figures""
[4:23:36] <+CursedNobleman> this translation LUL
[4:23:37] <%QueequegTheater> I think it's hilarious that they tried to make Emet-Selch look ugly in FFXIV but the fujoshis fucking LOVE him
[4:23:41] <tolloponik> why are those chuckle fucks just laughing in the background
[4:23:43] <+RenoDeGeneric> he does have a weird gaunt face, but he's still my twink
[4:23:46] <justcallmebobplease> Cheer1000 Is there a single remake that you like more than the original, within the whole of gaming?  How about if that's expanded to include shows and movies?
[4:23:50] <+PleasantLee> hedgehog pies actually
[4:24:04] <zk_nails> damn bitch, you live like this?
[4:24:09] <%QueequegTheater> REmake is better than RE1
[4:24:18] <+CursedNobleman> @QueequegTheater ugly bastard?
[4:24:25] <%MightyDuckShoes> most fanart made Reno look like a sleep deprived guy. Sometimes an anime Jhonen Vasquez characters. before the extended lore games and specials
[4:24:34] <%cooldude69xx> @QueequegTheater Was he supposed to be ugly? He looked fine
[4:24:43] <+genobeam125> her final limit break is so good too
[4:25:00] <%Aridpython> It’s not about why, it’s about why not! plagueHeh
[4:25:05] <%QueequegTheater> @cooldude69xx I'm pretty sure he was supposed to look tired and unattractive
[4:25:22] <Coystick> There must be Aeris Resurrected fanmods out there that put her back into the story
[4:25:23] <%QueequegTheater> And he's the prettiest one of them all
[4:25:41] <+RobertWayneLewis98> he said the thing
[4:25:46] <+genobeam125> The thing what came from outer space
[4:25:46] <andiwaffles> I generally dislike them, I disliked the one for Abe's Odyssey
[4:25:49] <%QueequegTheater> What good game remakes are there besides RE1/2?
[4:25:51] <justcallmebobplease> That's still a solid answer, I'd say.
[4:25:52] <shadepman> resident evil is a prime example
[4:25:57] <+CursedNobleman> why are they called turks anyhow
[4:26:14] <%QueequegTheater> Because they're the Turks
[4:26:18] <HeroSolaire> REmake2 sucks only 1 is good
[4:26:19] <%QueequegTheater> It sounds cool
[4:26:27] <%QueequegTheater> @HeroSolaire lol
[4:26:28] <%QueequegTheater> lmao
[4:26:29] <+RobertWayneLewis98> LOOOOL
[4:26:29] <HeroSolaire> no remake that cuts content is good
[4:26:33] <%cooldude69xx> @QueequegTheater I wouldn't be surprised
[4:26:42] <ArashlTempesta> were they trying to capture or murder her?
[4:26:48] <MESeele> completely non lethal suppression
[4:26:50] <%Dakuu75> unless they're rubber bullets. (which they aren't)
[4:26:52] <person181> no better stopping than dead
[4:26:59] <%Heart0fInk> If you could get a remake of a bad game made into a good game what would you have remade?
[4:27:00] <%QueequegTheater> God, Reno is such a fucking asshole I love him
[4:27:01] <andiwaffles> esp because they want her alive
[4:27:10] <%QueequegTheater> @Heart0fInk Silent Hill 4
[4:27:15] <%QueequegTheater> Or DMC2
[4:27:17] <Shwepie> They're clearly using tranq ammo.
[4:27:17] <zerointelligence000> tbf killing is a good way to make someone stop
[4:27:28] <%Owkono> back one
[4:27:36] <%Heart0fInk> @Heart0fInk Yeah.. thatd be a good one
[4:27:37] <Samex_Comex> Throw barrels at them like Donkey Kong
[4:27:50] <+PleasantLee> leftmost in the back
[4:28:01] <%Owkono> yes
[4:28:22] <+PleasantLee> that man is dead
[4:28:29] <Dlent_> Imagine Aeris looking up here and seeing Cloud hem and haw about which barrel to push
[4:28:30] <%QueequegTheater> This is an oddly whimsical way to murder cops
[4:28:35] <%Dakuu75> that guy is dead btw... even an empty wooden barrel weighs a lot
[4:28:38] <+PleasantLee> or his wife has a paralyzed father for their children who cant work
[4:28:47] <ArashlTempesta> back to the slums then
[4:29:08] <person181> @Dakuu75 we've seen what an empty barrel did to worf
[4:29:11] <%QueequegTheater> Like, even if it's empty, that's still a solid 30-50 pounds of hard wood hitting you at like 30 miles per hour
[4:29:24] <%QueequegTheater> Does this barrel have any honor
[4:29:37] <+onlystrykerfan> Croudo-Kun
[4:29:50] <CaerwynMontale> Or she could just fight them and gain exp
[4:30:02] <+lordericter> NWAA
[4:30:12] <%Engwithan_Elder_God> Well now she can make the jump.
[4:30:25] <+lordericter> lmao
[4:30:26] <+PleasantLee> hahah
[4:30:27] <+D4C_Trice> if Wharf couldn't beat a barrel the turks don't have a chance
[4:30:36] <$Vampireinarm> and now its a toy sized church
[4:30:36] <+PleasantLee> never noticed that the church says CHURCH on it
[4:30:48] <person181> she's a little slow but she's got spirit
[4:30:50] <tolloponik> I like how cloud just expects people to jump as well as he can
[4:31:01] <CaerwynMontale> They know where she lives
[4:31:01] <%Explodincatz> Turks are just a mistranslation of Klingon
[4:31:04] <+lordericter> maybe Hojo has a way to track Holy or other specific materia
[4:31:15] <ArashlTempesta> sephiroth sensually sugested to go to church
[4:31:20] <%billenjoi> !uptime
[4:31:21] <@Nightbot> 4 hours 31 minutes 30 seconds
[4:31:25] <$Vampireinarm> its just anime convininence
[4:31:29] <andiwaffles> I mean, they know she hangs at the church I suppose
[4:31:49] <person181> nothing like a church that says "CHURCH" on the front
[4:31:49] <+CursedNobleman> I bet they hold hands Kreygasm
[4:32:05] <Samex_Comex> Turns out it's not a Church but a nightclub called Church
[4:32:08] <%Aridpython> Hand holding!? snuffLewd
[4:32:16] <netarms> CHURCH
[4:32:24] <$Vampireinarm> most churches just say "church of the blah blah blah" in front of it irl
[4:32:35] <+5Two> Maybe it was a Church's Chicken?
[4:32:49] <+lordericter> yeah this is a nice painting
[4:33:07] <+RobertWayneLewis98> uhuhuhuhuhu
[4:33:30] <+CursedNobleman> mmmmn. frisky.
[4:33:39] <+D4C_Trice> How was Tseng portrayed in this compared to remake? he seems smarmy in remake but was a chill dude in CC
[4:33:42] <+onlystrykerfan> Aeris is a pervert
[4:33:47] <andiwaffles> if I was her I wouldn't want to be that forthcoming
[4:33:49] <Coystick> A sex glow
