[0:02:40] <Murphio_GS> Hello
[0:03:30] <Samex_Comex> We can Plague if you want to, we can leave your friends behind
[0:03:59] <ediblemold> May your hunt be successful.
[0:04:19] <laserbeaming> Deltarune!
[0:04:32] <+crowmium> I too like waifus
[0:04:37] <Murphio_GS> LUL LUL
[0:04:48] <laserbeaming> I did most of chapter 2. The characters are super cute. Ralsei is best fluffy boy
[0:05:04] <%Jay_Java> what a weird fanart. it's just him staring at green
[0:05:22] <laserbeaming> if you're saying something Plague. We can't hear you.
[0:05:23] <Superloan> Heyo Plague
[0:05:24] <ediblemold> Yer muted Plague. In case you didn't know.
[0:05:27] <Murphio_GS> Can't hear you if you're talking to us
[0:05:28] <+kogathemaster> yo, hi there plague, also muted
[0:05:31] <disrupted_sp> muted
[0:05:42] <Superloan> There ya go
[0:05:46] <laserbeaming> we hear now!
[0:05:48] <jetpack_rorschasch> No aound
[0:05:51] <Murphio_GS> Right, good
[0:05:51] <%Jay_Java> i thought his cat tuber was just yawning
[0:06:05] <+crowmium> no
[0:06:13] <%Jay_Java> that's crazy dawg
[0:06:16] <+crowmium> Kappa
[0:06:17] <Murphio_GS> Everything would be so different
[0:06:25] <%Jay_Java> butterflies are beautiful
[0:06:30] <disrupted_sp> as long as you dont pull a DSP
[0:06:34] <Samex_Comex> You are a dog instead of a cat
[0:06:39] <+valiantbug> stock market would have 100% crashed
[0:06:40] <Superloan> There's probably another universe where Chapter 7 is out with microtransactions
[0:06:47] <$saw6boy> hey plague, how're you doing?
[0:07:00] <+crowmium> in another parallel universe you would be a mathematician and not an artist
[0:07:00] <ediblemold> Imagine the dark karma that would be required in a timeline where computers simply works all the time.
[0:07:03] <Murphio_GS> Yeah Tobi is insane
[0:07:06] <%Jay_Java> 7 chapters for the 7 chaos emeralds
[0:07:30] <ediblemold> Over 7 realms
[0:07:36] <Superloan> How tiny are they
[0:07:36] <dowmein> meowdy
[0:07:42] <+crowmium> @jay_java you cracked the code
[0:07:53] <%Jay_Java> it's elementary, really
[0:08:31] <hector_ib> i shall not see the gameplay because i want to go in blind, but i wish you all a pleasant evening
[0:08:41] <laserbeaming> Well, you're going to have fun here then
[0:08:45] <%Jay_Java> shmups are for shmucks anyway
[0:08:46] <+Omotat> well you're gonna have a ton of fun with this then
[0:08:48] <hector_ib> and yes im looking forward to drawable characters
[0:08:53] <Superloan> Get close to attacks to get TP
[0:09:02] <ediblemold> The same except you want to graze bullets now.
[0:09:04] <dowmein> shmups are in fact the best type of video game
[0:09:10] <%Jay_Java> the only thing I remember is funny chalk eating barney waifu
[0:09:11] <jetpack_rorschasch> Then get ready to get frustrated.
[0:09:15] <laserbeaming> Plot Element #1: Ralsei is a Fluffy Boi
[0:09:17] <Murphio_GS> Yeah chapter 1 was like "Your choices don't matter, but that's the point"
[0:09:20] <Samex_Comex> There was a raindeer and a dinosaur
[0:09:32] <%Jay_Java> it will NEVER happen. not in undertale land
[0:09:33] <Samex_Comex> A fat clown
[0:09:34] <Superloan> Looking forward to you drawing Queen!
[0:09:57] <%Jay_Java> oh my

[0:10:45] <+kogathemaster> I be dead by the point this game is over
[0:10:49] <ediblemold> Maybe he'll be done before Oda.
[0:11:11] <beefomkers> Have you played this before? Did I miss anything?
[0:11:17] <%Jay_Java> hey, everything ends some day. most often with disappointment
[0:11:18] <vladtet909> Oh goodie, time for the internet trashfire game

[0:16:23] <%Revan175757> hey Plague
[0:16:47] <%Revan175757> yeah don't
[0:16:59] <Murphio_GS> There's a lot of faceslapping in this chapter
[0:17:16] <%Revan175757> do you know what's u[ story wise, or is this a blind run?
[0:17:22] <@Nightbot> Plague is a youtube animator and also streams at https://picarto.tv/Plague . Also: t-shirts! http://goo.gl/lze8QO

[0:18:17] <+BigCoffee> Most did make it
[0:18:20] <+twohitgood> ralsei and asriel are two different characters (though i have my suspicions)
[0:18:27] <+DeaconBluesClues> didnt the script for this predate undertale
[0:18:30] <%Jay_Java> i feel there's gonna be a lot of "oh yeah, THAT character"
[0:18:36] <%Revan175757> Tem is insert character, she is here
[0:18:45] <vladtet909> Muffet was a backer character
[0:18:48] <%Jay_Java> tem is nepotism
[0:18:51] <MZess> Asriel = scalie
[0:19:04] <+BigCoffee> You can toggle auto run in your options
[0:19:09] <+DeaconBluesClues> the word on the street is this has a lot more horny on main energy

[0:19:51] <%Revan175757> it's a shutter like the shop ones
[0:19:52] <lexitheshark> in the settings menu you have the option to turn on autorun
[0:19:53] <+CEOByori> "order for table seven!"

[0:20:29] <+twohitgood> name their guitars*
[0:20:45] <%kyh9> My parents use it to watch CNN, MSNBC, ABC, CBS and Fox all day
[0:20:45] <+twohitgood> you're always Kris
[0:20:48] <+mercurylev> It'd still say "Kris"
[0:20:49] <benjiFG> it's always kris
[0:20:50] <superstarshizzy> no, always kris

[0:20:54] <+BigCoffee> still Kris
[0:20:56] <ediblemold> Kris is Kris.
[0:20:57] <MZess> it only uses your name for the save file
[0:21:05] <Murphio_GS> Yeah
[0:21:18] <%Revan175757> cause you are friends now
[0:21:26] <mellorolo> power of friendshi[!
[0:21:35] <%Revan175757> sounds like paige
[0:21:46] <%Revan175757> acts like Paige
[0:21:49] <%Revan175757> she is Paige
[0:21:53] <+BigCoffee> I think Suzie is just a sad lonely girl who finally found a place to belong too
[0:21:54] <+potatodono_> She's getting better
[0:21:57] <%Jay_Java> paige in purple
[0:22:09] <Murphio_GS> I like Susie, she's not the best character, but she's Susie
[0:22:12] <tanarath> Oh, did Paige tell Plague about the waifs?
[0:22:15] <+askalta> she's female Sasuke so everyone forgives her
[0:22:32] <MZess> he's probably planned it from the start
[0:22:33] <%Revan175757> @askalta c'mon she is not as bad
[0:22:34] <+BigCoffee> Keep playing, you will see nice implications soon and you can figure it out
[0:22:34] <%Jay_Java> noelle is a lil twerp. take her lunch money
[0:22:35] <supascoot> i have a feeling it was always there, she has a lot of plot points in part 1
[0:22:45] <%kyh9> Smug
[0:22:48] <+DeaconBluesClues> I kinda hate this sprite
[0:22:48] <mellorolo> suzie is a violent bitch :v
[0:22:49] <%Revan175757> this fucking bird sucks
[0:22:50] <+potatodono_> She had a slightly bigger role in the first chapter than the other classmates
[0:22:54] <%kyh9> It's an expression of smugness
[0:23:06] <Murphio_GS> Look at his smug
[0:23:11] <+BigCoffee> It's his shit eating grin
[0:23:28] <+BigCoffee> I hope so
[0:23:39] <%Revan175757> this game is the group project Eli. That's the joke
[0:23:47] <Murphio_GS> Oh god
[0:24:06] <Murphio_GS> When vtubers do that I get freaked out
[0:24:19] <locobo98> the evil mirror version of you
[0:24:20] <+askalta> yeah I definitely don't do that as an adult
[0:24:27] <%kyh9> I killed my mirror version, so I have no reflection
[0:24:28] <mellorolo> kinda narcissistic :v
[0:24:37] <%Revan175757> i have no mirrors
[0:24:38] <AFewGoodTaters> dayoMEOW dayoMEAT
[0:24:39] <%Jay_Java> idk my mirrorsona's kind of an asshole tbf
[0:24:39] <Sapphire_Breeze> fuck the mirror people, they look like assholes
[0:24:39] <BillieNoMates> Thats bad on their side tho. They want endless misery
[0:24:44] <%kyh9> People think it's weird when I tell them about the mirror world
[0:24:46] <jayhawk_00> You're very creepy, you know that Plague?
[0:24:53] <%Akumaou> yes I did try that as a kid
[0:24:55] <Murphio_GS> Is susie cool or nah?
[0:25:06] <TimetodiveLTX> she's cool
[0:25:10] <%JailShmixRemix> Shes cool

[0:25:18] <%kyh9> Yes
[0:25:23] <Eightgutter> an eff
[0:25:24] <EliahNebb> that's right. FPS starts with a vowel sound.
[0:25:25] <+DeaconBluesClues> is she suggesting some amsr bullshit
[0:25:28] <+potatodono_> yay english
[0:25:28] <beefomkers> I hate Alphys and Susie is a psycho
[0:25:32] <%Revan175757> If she sucks as a teacher, wich she does, she would say it like that
[0:25:36] <mellorolo> issuzie  cool? she use to scare me..
[0:25:38] <%JailShmixRemix> Thats incorrect
[0:25:43] <AFewGoodTaters> just a fyi

[0:26:13] <+rdark_ksu> dinosaur or something
[0:26:13] <Murphio_GS> Barney
[0:26:14] <AFewGoodTaters> she's an anime
[0:26:14] <+DeaconBluesClues> I knew a dude who acted exactly like susie but of course, a dude and who was my "friend" for years. it kinda sucked kinda
[0:26:15] <BillieNoMates> Scalie bait
[0:26:15] <PersonifiedTFT> she's a Barney
[0:26:16] <TechDragon_Z> I think she's a dino
[0:26:17] <Mr_216> KomodoHype
[0:26:19] <locobo98> barney
[0:26:19] <ZanRebel> horse or hipopotamus ?
[0:26:24] <gooman_the_gooster> kelpie
[0:26:28] <locobo98> shes fuggin porple
[0:26:34] <Murphio_GS> I think she's vaguely a dinosaur like Alphys
[0:26:42] <%Revan175757> no you don't want that
[0:26:44] <jetpack_rorschasch> Lizard or dinosaur
[0:26:45] <+BigCoffee> Susie is suposed to be a dino butch
[0:26:47] <%Revan175757> Not in America
[0:26:51] <%Akumaou> LUL
[0:26:55] <$saw6boy> same voice too
[0:26:57] <BillieNoMates> Only if you kept the voice
[0:26:57] <%Jay_Java> i literally can't
[0:26:57] <+askalta> I would start paying you
[0:26:59] <AFewGoodTaters> id donate 200 dollars right now
[0:27:01] <Sapphire_Breeze> only if the voice is the same
[0:27:02] <+fxvg> that's not all that would rocket
[0:27:07] <TechDragon_Z> You'd probably be getting a lot of unsolicited dick pics
[0:27:10] <%Jay_Java> you being a bald frumpy farmer is too engrained in my image of you
[0:27:10] <Murphio_GS> oh no
[0:27:20] <%Revan175757> big gay
[0:27:22] <%JailShmixRemix> Huh, apparently, AN FPS is correct, because you have the e vowel sound in the F. Ie An Fyi vs A Fyi
[0:27:29] <%kyh9> I have a crush on susie too
[0:27:30] <jetpack_rorschasch> You are a cute girl to us Plague! BibleThump
[0:27:33] <BillieNoMates> How about a bald frumpy little girl, @Jay_Java?
[0:27:34] <+mercurylev> Noelle's got it BAD
[0:27:36] <%Jay_Java> the best i can do is imagine you but with a comically undersized dress
[0:27:48] <Eightgutter> noelle's parents
[0:27:50] <PersonifiedTFT> Sans is probably fucking your mom
[0:27:52] <+mercurylev> Naw they're divorced here too
[0:27:52] <+BigCoffee> they are dicorved
[0:27:52] <beefomkers> No they're divorced
[0:27:53] <Murphio_GS> Tori and Sans I guess
[0:27:57] <BillieNoMates> Its aiming for tumblr so probably 1
[0:27:57] <supascoot> no, its a different reality
[0:27:58] <$Rshiners> theyre still divorced
[0:27:59] <vladtet909> They were married
[0:27:59] <%Revan175757> Toriel and that guy divorsed and she hates him
[0:28:02] <+potatodono_> they are super divorced in this one too
[0:28:07] <jetpack_rorschasch> Nope, all lesbians.
[0:28:08] <rittergeist> They're still divorced.
[0:28:11] <$Rshiners> asgore sleeps on a futon in his shop
[0:28:13] <+askalta> most couple break up after their kid dies

[0:28:58] <MZess> Wow, plague wrote this game
[0:29:09] <%Revan175757> also that closer line is funny in relation to Susie
[0:29:31] <PersonifiedTFT> We were the one who encouraged Noelle to talk to Susie in chapter 1
[0:29:39] <PersonifiedTFT> so we're already the wingman
[0:29:48] <Murphio_GS> I love that Susie has big himbo energy
[0:29:54] <%Revan175757> not really
[0:29:55] <+potatodono_> Will they? Won't they? I hate it so much
[0:30:00] <Insignificant_Cat> Susie is denser than osmium
[0:30:01] <%Revan175757> we don't need them
[0:30:07] <+mercurylev> I mean, you see Catti's parents
[0:30:20] <PersonifiedTFT> you see a lot of peoples parents
[0:30:25] <+mercurylev> Or is it Catty's

[0:30:59] <Murphio_GS> Susie's hair is up
[0:31:01] <Srthunda> suz no longer has hair covering her eyes
[0:31:05] <PersonifiedTFT> you can see susie's eyes
[0:31:11] <%Revan175757> they are different
[0:31:12] <%kyh9> They're different from Chapter 1
[0:31:13] <%JailShmixRemix> They are different from the first game
[0:31:18] <%kyh9> New engine I think?

[0:32:05] <mellorolo> does anybody get pokemon vibes from this game?
[0:32:08] <$Charlie99993> I don't think you could get any experience in the last chapter
[0:32:10] <Iamjustabox> You spend chapter one as LV 1, nothing impacts LV
[0:32:10] <MZess> you can't get any XP in the first game so you stay level 1 during the whole chapter 1
[0:32:19] <Murphio_GS> @mellorolo kinda
[0:32:24] <mellorolo> go for a walk plague :v
[0:32:32] <Iamjustabox> Although your class title changes, so you can be a LV 1 Bed Inspector
[0:32:38] <Murphio_GS> Like if pokémon actually had a story
[0:32:42] <%Revan175757> Eli you sound very masochistic right now
[0:32:44] <+askalta> you're in Kentucky right?
[0:32:55] <BillieNoMates> Gentlemen, CORN!
[0:33:05] <Murphio_GS> Plague lives in fried chicken land
[0:33:08] <AFewGoodTaters> dayoMEOW 🌽
[0:33:08] <+rdark_ksu> I remember growing up and being able to tell the time of year by the crops.
[0:33:09] <%Revan175757> i mean who the fuck enjoys strong winds?
[0:33:21] <Murphio_GS> Yeah he doesn't wear the hat now
[0:33:56] <Iamjustabox> I miss shadow Ralsei, I like that design a lot more, but unshadowed Ralsei has some good animations in ch2
[0:33:57] <Murphio_GS> He's a loner prince guy
[0:33:58] <+DeaconBluesClues> his backstory is that he is extremely vague about his backstory
[0:34:01] <+BigCoffee> he's the dark prince, this is his home
[0:34:04] <+silvery_cricket> He doesnt have one
[0:34:05] <%Revan175757> his backstory is that he is a prince of a dark kingdom with no subjects
[0:34:09] <Murphio_GS> probably born from darkness
[0:34:10] <$Charlie99993> he's the dark prince in a prophecy where you guys are the heroes
[0:34:18] <%Revan175757> also Ralsei is very SUS
[0:34:35] <$Charlie99993> Also he's a certified cuite patootie
[0:34:45] <+DeaconBluesClues> like this guy is very suspicious in general, yeah thats correct
[0:34:46] <Coystick> That v i e n
[0:34:47] <Iamjustabox> The little "popping vein" symbol
[0:34:48] <ediblemold> The lowest line makes me think of Harry Potters scar.
[0:34:52] <Sapphire_Breeze> it looks like a harry potter scar to me
[0:34:57] <+silvery_cricket> I kinda want to kick this goat
[0:35:00] <+silvery_cricket> I dont  know why
[0:35:04] <%Jay_Java> tic tac toe is the most bullshit game ever
[0:35:09] <Murphio_GS> Don't kick the goat
[0:35:12] <sendart> he is very sus and gay
[0:35:15] <MZess> he's ~magic~
[0:35:27] <+silvery_cricket> Turns out the plot of Deltarune is there is a natural gas leak under school
[0:35:32] <%Revan175757> yep
[0:35:37] <Murphio_GS> Yeah
[0:35:58] <$Charlie99993> I watched that
[0:35:59] <+jadedfont> I played on Game Gear a few times as a kid.
[0:35:59] <Mvrdok_> Could be the sound font
[0:36:01] <Murphio_GS> Love this music
[0:36:06] <BillieNoMates> too late
[0:36:08] <%JailShmixRemix> the fuck is gamegear?
[0:36:15] <+BigCoffee> east classrom
[0:36:24] <+jadedfont> Early handheld game system.
[0:36:25] <tanarath> @plagueofgripes I had a gamegear.
[0:36:25] <TimetodiveLTX> my mind... must comply
[0:36:32] <AFewGoodTaters> sounded game geary
[0:36:33] <$Charlie99993> @JailShmixRemix 6 AA batteries is what
[0:36:36] <%Revan175757> fashion
[0:36:42] <mellorolo> gamer gear :v
[0:36:49] <$Charlie99993> I also had a gamegear, but never the VAST BOUNTY required to keep batteries in it
[0:37:05] <AFewGoodTaters> Putt & Putter ftw
[0:37:18] <Murphio_GS> Yeah now this is a kind've home base
[0:37:22] <tanarath> You missed optional dialogue.
[0:37:33] <%Revan175757> so yeah all people here are just items from classroom
[0:37:37] <+BigCoffee> lancer's a sweet little shitter. He's like everyone's little brother
[0:37:40] <MZess> @tanarath it's gonna happen to everyone who streams this game, get used to it
[0:37:41] <PersonifiedTFT> she likes Lancer because they're both fucking gremlins
[0:37:41] <Sapphire_Breeze> it's hard not to like lancer
[0:37:45] <Murphio_GS> Susie likes losers, which is why she's hanging out with you and Ralsei
[0:37:48] <@Nightbot> Plague is a youtube animator and also streams at https://picarto.tv/Plague . Also: t-shirts! http://goo.gl/lze8QO
[0:37:56] <$Charlie99993> @tanarath there's so much in this game there's going to be no way he doesn't anyway
[0:38:00] <%Revan175757> you should have played the first episode
[0:38:00] <%kyh9> Dark World is basically a dream world
[0:38:01] <mellorolo> this gemlin simulator
[0:38:08] <%Revan175757> like you REALLY should have
[0:38:14] <Iamjustabox> Don't worry about it. Just blindly do everything Ralsei says!
[0:38:24] <MZess> don't worry, they're didn't explain it and they're not gonna
[0:38:24] <IceCreamAndAHug> Chapter 1's world took place in the dark version of your classroom
[0:38:37] <%kyh9> @Revan175757 I thought he did?
[0:38:43] <peachy996> You turned the light on at the end of Chapter 1
[0:38:56] <peachy996> So I can assume that wiped out the old dark worl
[0:39:04] <Murphio_GS> Yeah I know that feel
[0:39:08] <%Revan175757> @kyh9 well if he did, he doesn't remember anything xD
[0:39:10] <peachy996> But I don't fuckin know lol
[0:39:14] <mellorolo> headphones sucks ass
[0:39:44] <EliahNebb> this song is like a waltz version of cruel angel's thesis
[0:39:46] <Murphio_GS> It's a clover shaped bed, cause cards
[0:40:01] <sendart> blobs
[0:40:05] <%Scarnehu> spending time with the wife and kid. I'll be back for the vod ♡
[0:40:18] <mellorolo> we know what you mena
[0:40:18] <%Revan175757> Temmie is the main artist, i don't remember if she desings the characters though
[0:40:30] <Murphio_GS> I think you do it well for your animations, the generic guys well embody that
[0:40:31] <mellorolo> @Scarnehu bye have fun :D
[0:40:32] <rittergeist> Goddamnit Plague, stop putting yourself down.
[0:40:50] <%Revan175757> Plague with the BIG M energy again
[0:40:53] <Iamjustabox> I believe Toby has said that he sketches the original character designs and then Temmie redesigns them to "make them good"
[0:40:54] <mellorolo> destroy ::V
[0:41:03] <%Jay_Java> truuuuuuuue
[0:41:07] <+BlueLunecy> This is to learn the battle system
[0:41:14] <%kyh9> They changed the battle system a bit
[0:41:15] <Murphio_GS> Training will help with that, it wont hurt you
[0:41:30] <%kyh9> lmao
[0:41:31] <%Revan175757> well this area is for remembering stuff so DO SO
[0:41:37] <mellorolo> what is "hole" plague ? :V
[0:41:46] <tanarath> Plague, you really should do the training, it'll give you a refresh
[0:41:50] <Murphio_GS> grazing builds up magic points
[0:41:59] <tanarath> With no consequences.
[0:42:00] <+BubbaRands> Grazing personally?
[0:42:01] <mellorolo> lol
[0:42:02] <%Revan175757> TP = Toilet Paper
[0:42:08] <%Revan175757> xD
[0:42:09] <Iamjustabox> Magic meter. You get magic meter when a bullet goes near you without hitting you.
[0:42:16] <tanarath> Tension points, party-wide mana points
[0:42:27] <%EyeFarted> Tongue Punch
[0:42:41] <Murphio_GS> Yeah that's always great whenever it happens
[0:42:57] <%Revan175757> i remember Toby saying that most of characters would not work if Temmie wasnt there so that makes sense
[0:43:29] <+purplehazy> oi zoneLove
[0:43:51] <%Revan175757> Zone fan! hello!
[0:44:15] <%Revan175757> Zone-tan, the first true Vtuber
[0:44:25] <AFewGoodTaters> how ironic
[0:44:29] <AFewGoodTaters> maybe
[0:44:30] <peachy996> We have a local candy placec in our town but I do not dare to come in.
[0:44:31] <WFN_Art> cookie infused hellfire
[0:44:32] <Coystick> Cookies and burned flesh
[0:44:39] <+purplehazy> thats, sad but awesome
[0:45:09] <mellorolo> this is a nice pace compared to cut videos and highlights: i like this.
[0:45:20] <WFN_Art> cookie and waifu ? There you have it, lads
[0:45:20] <$saw6boy> there was a Howes plant in my town and it was the best when they roasted nuts
[0:46:20] <Murphio_GS> ~Mama--Miba~
[0:46:31] <%Revan175757> Tobey's humor is very very good. I always miss his style. It's so rare these days.
[0:46:51] <TheBasicEvil> look into Soundpad. it's pretty simple to use and it has a demo version.
[0:47:08] <%Revan175757> depending
[0:47:10] <BillieNoMates> no homo
[0:47:10] <Necnill> Nahhh
[0:47:11] <sendart> no
[0:47:12] <Maleicus> no
[0:47:13] <WFN_Art> 'tasty tumor you've got there"
[0:47:16] <Srthunda> like an entire arm? maybe
[0:47:29] <+purplehazy> cum?
[0:47:45] <Murphio_GS> It's a new function for chapter 2
[0:47:50] <$saw6boy> a mole that turns into a werthers hard candy
[0:48:07] <mellorolo> ohhh
[0:48:08] <mellorolo> coool
[0:48:26] <TimetodiveLTX> DARK SHIT
[0:48:31] <mellorolo> choking hazard
[0:48:36] <%HawkGoggles2> condom ghost are for the adults
[0:48:39] <Murphio_GS> Yeahhhh that's kinda sus
[0:48:46] <AFewGoodTaters> getting a condom for trick or treat is a big green light
[0:48:48] <%Revan175757> Condoms suck - "Pat and Woolie 2019"
[0:48:58] <mellorolo> condom ghost are more for the adults
[0:49:02] <WFN_Art> hey look it's you
[0:49:05] <Murphio_GS> Yeah he's neat
[0:49:09] <TimetodiveLTX> shawm
[0:49:12] <TimetodiveLTX> i hate it
[0:49:17] <WFN_Art> or your twin shopkeeper
[0:49:52] <%Revan175757> so what you are saying is that Temmie is very good huh?
[0:50:15] <Murphio_GS> Shawm is supposedly a magician if I remember right
[0:51:08] <%Revan175757> you see that character on his shelf? That's Temmie's character from her personal RPG she made
[0:51:12] <AFewGoodTaters> the monies...
[0:51:18] <Murphio_GS> I had money when I did it
[0:51:25] <switchbored505> No chapter 1 files, no money
[0:51:59] <AFewGoodTaters> melancholy
[0:52:02] <+DeaconBluesClues> melanchony
[0:52:12] <Murphio_GS> Meloncholy is always such a strange emotion
[0:52:42] <+purplehazy> grimace face?
[0:53:15] <Murphio_GS> Grimace is more an expression of disgust or looking down on something
[0:53:21] <%Revan175757> gotta go. ill watch the VOD later. Bye everyone!
[0:53:50] <Samex_Comex> I have Spaghetti now
[0:54:25] <+DeaconBluesClues> he got big man legs at one point
[0:55:11] <Murphio_GS> Hell yeah!
[0:55:37] <Murphio_GS> He's just an asshole
[0:55:53] <+BlueLunecy> I'd use one
[0:56:14] <jetpack_rorschasch> Not going to lie, that’d be great.
[0:56:28] <%HawkGoggles2> I don't know how hamsters don't get caught up in them
[0:57:00] <Nimorp> giant hamster wheel should be just one of the capital punishments
[0:57:00] <+VictorVonLouche> Its ok with the right sauce
[0:57:03] <%Jay_Java> boiled chicken is EXCELLENT, my guy
[0:57:07] <locobo98> yea
[0:57:07] <%Jay_Java> fuck you on about
[0:57:08] <locobo98> its bad
[0:57:12] <jayhawk_00> Yeah, it ain't great
[0:57:18] <locobo98> BUT
[0:57:23] <+DeaconBluesClues> my mom boils chicken as presage to preparing it in pancit
[0:57:24] <locobo98> stewed chicken
[0:57:28] <tubit> boiled chicken is kinda gross if it's not in a thai soup or something like that
[0:57:32] <Murphio_GS> Non home-made icing sucks
[0:57:38] <Murphio_GS> it's usually cheap and makes you sick
[0:57:47] <Samex_Comex> I had one of those cakes from walmart that look like a burger, the whole thing was frosting
[0:57:47] <locobo98> the issue with boiling is that all the good stuff ends up in the water
[0:57:52] <+BedHome> plague you reinvented slavery again
[0:57:55] <+BlueLunecy> I think Paper Mario had a level about that
[0:57:58] <+SteveSouth> treadmills were originally a prison device
[0:58:01] <locobo98> thats slavery
[0:58:10] <+BedHome> origionally they were actually water wheels
[0:58:16] <ralphwiggum16> Hi Plague.
[0:58:20] <+IMDRanged> Waifu huntin'
[0:58:23] <AFewGoodTaters> we already do that
[0:58:24] <ralphwiggum16> Can we be friends again?
[0:58:26] <+BedHome> then people realized you could replace the water with dogs, or children with nothing better to do
[0:58:39] <+BedHome> then it became a prison thing
[0:58:40] <Murphio_GS> Notice how you have awards when in real life you dont
[0:58:41] <Samex_Comex> I have a blue house with a blue window
[0:58:46] <AFewGoodTaters> but instead of power its wicker furniture
[0:59:12] <locobo98> plagues room looks like the room form serial experiments lain
[0:59:19] <locobo98> jsut a massive PC tower looming over him
[0:59:36] <Samex_Comex> I can't wait to have my own living room and kitchen someday
[0:59:38] <locobo98> it growls at him
[1:00:02] <%kyh9> or homeless!
[1:00:04] <locobo98> she sleeps in a common room
[1:00:05] <+BedHome> i guess she could be homeless? she does eat chalk
[1:00:10] <%Jay_Java> or maybe she's a homeless street kid who eats tresh
[1:00:10] <locobo98> or has a load of sibblings
[1:00:10] <Murphio_GS> Yeah, or she's homeless
[1:00:13] <LunarRemix> He's a magic boy
[1:00:25] <+IMDRanged> mst3kMTo
[1:00:39] <locobo98> shes gonna eat the manual
[1:00:42] <Murphio_GS> FRIDGEROOM
[1:00:46] <+EtherealSanity> If you've got a high enough room, you can probably build upwards, like a loft for a bed or supplies.
[1:01:08] <locobo98> lancer
[1:01:14] <$Charlie99993> It's his room 1:1 from chapter 1
[1:01:19] <tubit> eclectic
[1:01:31] <ralphwiggum16> Ruh-pies
[1:01:33] <+IMDRanged> laphinHungee yovgStare ajscage
[1:01:35] <Murphio_GS> Yeah Lancer doesn't need much to be happy
[1:01:41] <%Jay_Java> legally distinct rupees
[1:01:46] <vivaldiva> zoneSplat
[1:01:51] <ralphwiggum16> Plague do you like being a kitty more than a human man?
[1:02:35] <+BedHome> what if you made it out of photocollage
[1:02:37] <Mr_216> GlitchCat
[1:02:38] <+IMDRanged> You were getting Torgo look almost
[1:02:39] <+BinaryFireball> but is it the most true to you?
[1:02:42] <ralphwiggum16> I like your piercing red eyes.
[1:02:43] <%kyh9> I like it
[1:02:48] <Murphio_GS> You could've been a hot girl if you wanted to
[1:02:49] <Necnill> It's cute! You can still do whatever character you want though, even if it is a hot guy or girl
[1:02:56] <%caramello_man> Why didn't you make it an owl?
[1:03:13] <Murphio_GS> He's a peachboy because he's shaped like a peach
[1:03:18] <+IMDRanged> Do  you have pants on like Goofy or no pants like Donald
[1:03:22] <+BubbaRands> How about a hot catgirlman?
[1:03:31] <%Jay_Java> slime is awesome
[1:03:41] <Murphio_GS> Sloppy is hot
[1:03:42] <peachy996> Sloppy Joes then
[1:03:45] <BUDderzIllA> YO, PLAGUE
[1:03:51] <%EyeFarted> Youd probably hate okra
[1:03:52] <AFewGoodTaters> i prefer moist
[1:04:20] <+BubbaRands> Plagues a dry guy Kappa
[1:04:24] <+IMDRanged> I still can't believe you hate the Borg Queen
[1:04:29] <LunarRemix> Down from the main plaza
[1:04:31] <Murphio_GS> Back where you came from
[1:04:41] <%kyh9> go down
[1:04:51] <jaypeesan> Evening mr plague
[1:05:51] <%kyh9> big gay
[1:06:00] <%kyh9> Time to eat mutton chops
[1:06:13] <LunarRemix> It doesn't open anyway
[1:06:18] <Murphio_GS> Just a bunch of legs stacked on top of each other
[1:06:19] <ralphwiggum16> Are there lots of goblins in this game?
[1:06:44] <LunarRemix> It does not
[1:06:51] <+BedHome> NO SPOILER
[1:06:52] <ralphwiggum16> 2/10
[1:07:05] <Spagheddies> The characters are still around, but uhhh not exactly. You'll see.
[1:07:18] <Murphio_GS> Angy face
[1:07:33] <Murphio_GS> Lancer can
[1:07:40] <Murphio_GS> Because he's literally just an object
[1:08:23] <whittacre> you'll see in a minute
[1:08:25] <Hoot_Patoots> Rules card
[1:08:25] <kodeyh166> rules
[1:08:33] <whittacre> it's quite a literal interpretation
[1:08:37] <peachy996> Rules Card
[1:08:47] <peachy996> That's why he's such a massive ponce
[1:09:19] <Murphio_GS> Notice that? How lancer is an object? Weird isn't it? Kappa
[1:10:40] <whittacre> i think it's teh town library
[1:10:41] <Chaossheep> Librarby yes
[1:10:50] <Murphio_GS> There she is
[1:11:18] <Ardailec> When you can bench press a bently
[1:11:33] <Hoot_Patoots> in undertale yeah
[1:11:38] <Spagheddies> In Undertale.
[1:11:39] <Hoot_Patoots> i guess it's different here
[1:11:43] <LunarRemix> Without spoiling much it seems like the rules in this universe are different
[1:11:45] <Chaossheep> Undyne is a special case in UT as well though
[1:11:53] <Hoot_Patoots> it's why a child could beat up most monsters
[1:11:54] <$Charlie99993> No
[1:11:57] <sendart> no
[1:11:58] <+coward_man> yeah but Undyne's magic is in her muscles and anime
[1:12:02] <+BedHome> yes!
[1:12:07] <$Charlie99993> That Undyne stuff never happened
[1:12:07] <AFewGoodTaters> maybe
[1:12:08] <Chaossheep> Nah Undyne never did anything like that, she's just such a badass
[1:12:11] <Hoot_Patoots> to be fair, a car is not a human !
[1:12:12] <+SaphronBlackbourne> No that did not happen
[1:12:14] <tanarath> No, but maybe
[1:12:15] <Spagheddies> AFAIK Undyne wasn't part of any experiments.
[1:12:20] <%Jay_Java> no undyne is just built differentially
[1:12:37] <tanarath> Monsters were better, humans have Determination
[1:12:41] <Spagheddies> She just draws power from the Rule Of Cool.
[1:12:46] <%boatzndhoez> didnt expect THIS game O_O
[1:12:54] <Chaossheep> The monsters that were infused with determination melted together into freakazoids, but Undyne just harnessed it because she had to become the hero in the genocide route
[1:12:56] <%cosmicleviathan18> is this dude bench pressing a car?!
[1:12:58] <AncelDeLambert> no, Alphys ran those experiments
[1:13:00] <Hoot_Patoots> yeah she was just very strong
[1:13:02] <lexitheshark> Undyne was strong because of the power of anime
[1:13:04] <Murphio_GS> IN UT she was I think she was
[1:13:07] <+EtherealSanity> omg metal crusher honks! I didn't notice that before
[1:13:08] <switchbored505> Well, if you want to get technical, Deltarune is an AU. It's a different story that just happens to have some similar characters.
[1:13:08] <LunarRemix> She was. That person was wrong.
[1:13:10] <peachy996> Oh I recognize that little tune from UT
[1:13:10] <TubeMan642> the horns are playing Metal Crusher
[1:13:13] <$Charlie99993> Undyne in the genocide route manages to manifest determination naturally
[1:13:17] <+coward_man> the cars honking were doing Mettatons theme
[1:13:17] <ralphwiggum16> Plague, you're mixing up memories now. Early-onset dementia.
[1:13:19] <Srthunda> was paige sharing fanfics with you again?
[1:13:21] <AncelDeLambert> Undyne was just so hyped by the idea of anime that she found her own Determination
[1:13:22] <+SaphronBlackbourne> No she wasn't
[1:13:25] <tanarath> It's vague
[1:13:26] <TimetodiveLTX> the horn track is world class comedic timing
[1:13:26] <meanderingautism> nope just that determined
[1:13:27] <+BedHome> hes not im pretty sure that was a thing?
[1:13:28] <TimetodiveLTX> imo
[1:13:30] <Spagheddies> Ah, on the Genocide route. Yeah, she manifests determination, but she isn't experimented on.
[1:13:33] <Murphio_GS> It's why she had her eye gauged out I think
[1:13:34] <+BedHome> like it was suggested
[1:13:37] <LunarRemix> @Charlie99993 Not naturally. She had Ice cream with Determination sprinkled on it
[1:13:44] <$Charlie99993> The thing that makes her hard to beat up normally is that she has metal armor
[1:13:44] <+coward_man> Undyne's "special training" was watching anime
[1:14:01] <lexitheshark> It was all based on Anime
[1:14:06] <$Charlie99993> Yeah, the special training was anime
[1:14:07] <%Jay_Java> in a non-genocide route where you kill undyne, she just melts into a puddle and dies because she didn't have enough rage to handle her own determination
[1:14:09] <tanarath> She does and it's cool
[1:14:17] <AncelDeLambert> Genocide Fisk was just such a threat that she FOUND Determination
[1:14:42] <switchbored505> Undertale Undyne only has one eye, this one has two.
[1:14:47] <LunarRemix> It's not her own determination, it's from secret ice cream that had Determination that Alphys gave her over time
[1:14:50] <TimetodiveLTX> undyne *seems* naturally determined but now that you mention it and considering her connection with alphys...
[1:15:00] <sangi53> supppp
[1:15:02] <%Jay_Java> ANOTHER ENTRANCE TO THE YEERK POOL!
[1:15:09] <sangi53> this trek episode looking mighty weird
[1:15:12] <%Jay_Java> TOBIAS, GIVE US THE RUNDOWN
[1:15:12] <TimetodiveLTX> that isn't explicitly mentioned in the game though
[1:15:20] <aliasz50> it is implied undyne had determination  cause he melted at the end but who knows if it was natural or artificial
[1:15:26] <zedravan> oh no another entrance to the UK
[1:15:29] <Murphio_GS> Yeah it's not explicit whatever Undyne's deal in Undertale
[1:15:42] <Chaossheep> aliasz50 undyne melted because she was getting stabbed and monsters can't handle determination in the first place
[1:15:52] <Hoot_Patoots> It's explicitely said that determination will have an adverse effect on monsters, but it doesn't have to be through experiment
[1:16:02] <sangi53> it's rule of cool
[1:16:21] <squidpeanut> @hoot_patoots case and point, undyne melting
[1:16:23] <Chaossheep> the fact that she didn't die from Chara's first attack alone is a testament to how insanely strong she is. No one else can take more than one hit. No one.
[1:16:30] <Hoot_Patoots> @squidpeanut ye
[1:16:38] <MZess> really love that you pose for this
[1:16:42] <+BedHome> you could wear half a wig
[1:16:43] <peachy996> Hair can be annoying in the heat
[1:16:50] <Murphio_GS> Taking care of hair is annoying and it gets in your eyes
[1:16:52] <peachy996> Then you have to comb it and it's such a bitch
[1:16:55] <rittergeist> Do you still have to shampoo your head if you're bald?
[1:16:59] <Samex_Comex> You are not bald, you just got taller then your hair
[1:17:05] <%boatzndhoez> pvpThink
[1:17:10] <+VictorVonLouche> oh had that
[1:17:14] <+FadingEmber> pulls at your scalp probably
[1:17:15] <jaypeesan> <--- bald as fak, i can relate with having headache and hair driving me nuts
[1:17:16] <squidpeanut> Hair is like a hat that grows
[1:17:20] <peachy996> Yup
[1:17:21] <Murphio_GS> Yeah hair sucks
[1:17:22] <@Nightbot> Plague is a youtube animator and also streams at https://picarto.tv/Plague . Also: t-shirts! http://goo.gl/lze8QO
[1:17:43] <+EtherealSanity> I'm gonna kill my hair soon as well.
[1:17:48] <madpuppy2424> Long thick heavy wavy hair. I can relate. It’s not amazing
[1:17:53] <Hoot_Patoots> i love long hair but i cut mine recently. One of the things that annoyed me is when i sleep, i kept geting stuck on my own hair
[1:18:52] <Murphio_GS> Water slides yeah yeah
[1:19:02] <%Jay_Java> yeah! and everyone wearing bikinis
[1:19:09] <+megaotter> Skies of Arcadia kind of did that
[1:19:12] <+BedHome> like goku removing his weights
[1:19:20] <Samex_Comex> Use hoses to move the water
[1:19:33] <Spagheddies> You'll see.
[1:19:34] <peachy996> They have outlet faces to me
[1:19:34] <Hoot_Patoots> you shall see !
[1:19:34] <Murphio_GS> Eraser? I dont know
[1:19:48] <lexitheshark> They're power outlets
[1:19:49] <Coystick> Sleep apnea malwares
[1:19:51] <Samex_Comex> They look like Robotgirl from Robotboy
[1:19:55] <Murphio_GS> lmao
[1:20:03] <lexitheshark> Their faces are US wall power ports
[1:20:12] <Coystick> There she be
[1:20:15] <TubeMan642> electrical socket maybe
[1:20:19] <$Charlie99993> THERE SHE IS
[1:20:24] <Blue_Cornflower> i save money on haircuts by cutting my own hair with a hair trimmer, it's like a monk hairstyle after i cut it
[1:20:27] <Chaossheep> Waifu contender 1, she's great
[1:20:32] <tanarath> Mommy
[1:21:00] <Coystick> She has a Thief 2 Mechanist head
[1:21:00] <zedravan> avocado hed
[1:21:05] <+KingKrampus> xenomorph x Steven Universe White Diamond
[1:21:06] <beefyhoward> I have tried drawing her head and it suuuuucked
[1:21:08] <Hoot_Patoots> big stupid
[1:21:09] <Spagheddies> She's your waifu confirmed.
[1:21:13] <Blue_Cornflower> also with a monk hairstyle, i have almost no hair on the floor which needs cleaning
[1:21:17] <Murphio_GS> Tru
[1:21:48] <+BedHome> if my stepdad hadnt ruined "baldness as a hairstyle by choice" for me i might try it, honestly
[1:21:49] <Blue_Cornflower> most adults are just better at hiding their stupidity
[1:21:51] <Coystick> I changed, I got hot.
[1:21:55] <Murphio_GS> There's people who do change though, just not everyone
[1:22:18] <Hoot_Patoots> the sprite work and portraits have been really good in ch2
[1:22:23] <Samex_Comex> But I was stupid as a kid? uh oh
[1:22:24] <sangi53> she looked like an eggplant
[1:22:39] <Hoot_Patoots> oh no it's the borg queen
[1:22:47] <Murphio_GS> Yeah Queen is for some reason obsessed with robots and electronics and stuff
[1:23:04] <tanarath> @samex_comex yep, I was too
[1:23:25] <Blue_Cornflower> @Samex_Comex if you think your younger self was stupid compared to now, that must mean you've gotten smarter, right? arypieSmile
[1:23:30] <+BedHome> did you do the tutorial?
[1:23:34] <Coystick> Enjoy: Your Ass-
[1:23:35] <Spagheddies> It's always been.
[1:23:36] <%kyh9> Stupid sexy robo milf
[1:23:38] <+BedHome> in the party dojo
[1:23:39] <Murphio_GS> Yeah this is more heavily turn based
[1:23:54] <sendart> still the same
[1:23:58] <Coystick> GENOCIDE TIME
[1:24:02] <Murphio_GS> Tired doesn't matter if you dont have Ralsei
[1:24:05] <TubeMan642> remember no killing
[1:24:08] <Blue_Cornflower> what does TP stand for?
[1:24:10] <$Charlie99993> Really it's just the same as Undertale as far as turned basedness, but you have multiple turns
[1:24:13] <Samsaz> jiggle jiggle Kreygasm
[1:24:22] <Murphio_GS> Throw yourself at the weire
[1:24:25] <Venasus> @Blue_Cornflower tension points
[1:24:37] <Blue_Cornflower> @Venasus thanks amedolPat
[1:24:39] <$Charlie99993> Check is always your standard 'examine' command
[1:25:03] <+BedHome> minor , the trainings only three challanges to introduce new and old concepts like grazing, and you get kinda useful rewards
[1:25:11] <tanarath> @plagueofgripes tutorial was short, the challenges were a refresher, nothing more
[1:25:15] <kodeyh166> welp
[1:25:26] <+VictorVonLouche> Tutorial - build up the mercy meter to spare. Tired - Some characters have spells to auto mercy enemies. You can use turn order to act and then spare at the same time if they are close to sparing.
[1:25:28] <zedravan> there is a mercy meter now
[1:25:33] <sendart> you also have a defend
[1:25:35] <Blue_Cornflower> i hope plague draws suzie lilybelleLove but if he doesn't, that's okay naroDance
[1:25:38] <switchbored505> You can always just not attack
[1:25:39] <+BlueLunecy> Generally ACTs with a party member icon are more effective
[1:25:40] <TubeMan642> you can just defend if you don't want to attack
[1:25:56] <Murphio_GS> Yup
[1:26:13] <%kyh9> When it's ABOUT to be aligned
[1:26:42] <kodeyh166> the x
[1:26:52] <+VictorVonLouche> Should spare witht he second character susi
[1:26:52] <tanarath> Mercy it with suzie, not kris @plagueofgripes
[1:27:06] <+VictorVonLouche> Cant act
[1:27:14] <Murphio_GS> Yeah I think you have
[1:27:17] <Spagheddies> Weakening doesn't matter unless you have goatboy.
[1:27:19] <tanarath> Actively kills them for now
[1:27:20] <axelkaspar> she can spare, when the mercy gauge is full
[1:27:25] <$Charlie99993> Attacks just kill 9/10 times
[1:27:32] <Venasus> Susie used to autoattack in chapter 1 but she doesn't have to fight. Also defending builds your TP
[1:27:41] <+VictorVonLouche> Its new mechanics
[1:27:42] <Venasus> attacking doesn't do anything if your goal is to spare
[1:28:22] <Murphio_GS> 70%
[1:28:24] <axelkaspar> him jiggle, her spare
[1:28:29] <+VictorVonLouche> Also TP is earned by near misses.
[1:28:34] <sendart> you can set up an act followed by a spare
[1:28:51] <Spagheddies> These enemies are rough to spare.
[1:28:54] <+VictorVonLouche> So you wanna be close to the shots while dodging
[1:28:59] <mapimb> you can gain tp by defending
[1:29:32] <tanarath> You can so act to get mercy then spare in the same turn
[1:29:33] <Murphio_GS> Ralsei's here,... somehow
[1:29:38] <Spagheddies> And there is Goatboy.
[1:29:39] <sangi53> MMMH
[1:29:43] <sendart> SUA
[1:29:49] <sendart> SUS*
[1:29:51] <sangi53> HE VENTED SUS
[1:29:54] <Spagheddies> Hmmmmm
[1:29:56] <Murphio_GS> Ralsei maybe not as much an object as the others
[1:29:59] <Murphio_GS> MMMMMMMM
[1:30:04] <Spagheddies> What could he have done...?
[1:30:09] <$Charlie99993> We don't really know, but there WAS a path between the two dark worlds in chapter 1
[1:30:12] <mapimb> seems a little sussy
[1:30:18] <Teewood_Flam> goat boy is all.. shaded and stuff
[1:30:36] <peachy996> Ralsei is equal parts adorable and suspicious
[1:30:39] <+BedHome> no one spoilers in any way
[1:30:45] <Samex_Comex> Make friends through adventure
[1:30:46] <axelkaspar> (GET READY for the bop of the DECADE)
[1:30:50] <Murphio_GS> Yeah no spoilers
[1:30:51] <tanarath> That would be really obvious, Plague. Would Toby be that obvious?
[1:30:52] <switchbored505> In chapter 1 you got to the other Dark World by going through a large gate
[1:30:55] <kodeyh166> oh check on lancer
[1:30:58] <Murphio_GS> This part is cool
[1:31:02] <beefyhoward> Banger
[1:31:09] <+EtherealSanity> catJAM
[1:31:10] <$Charlie99993> Actually, that door shuts again, so I think the door might just lead to any other current dark worlds (this is my conjecture based on chapter 1 and not spoilers)
[1:31:18] <+EtherealSanity> This part is so cool.
[1:31:20] <beefyhoward> catJAM
[1:31:36] <+BedHome> C Y B E R   W O R L D
[1:31:37] <Spagheddies> This entire place gives me SUPER intense No Straight Roads vibes
[1:31:38] <axelkaspar> I lost my mind when I first heard this track. It could be Toby's best
[1:31:47] <switchbored505> This world is very... Sonic-like
[1:31:48] <Puhff> you're welcome!
[1:31:50] <tanarath> don't forget to turn on autorun
[1:31:53] <Eger007> you actually are
[1:31:57] <+BedHome> i just saw you in the twitch sidebar honestly and i was like "sure why not"
[1:31:59] <TheLoneUnicorn> What is this?
[1:32:04] <Puhff> also, i just noticed that anagram of your name is POG. I feel very smart
[1:32:07] <wolfen091> we aint here for games, we here for you plague
[1:32:09] <Coystick> You're a purple lewd cat man, this game might be on brand for you
[1:32:14] <+BedHome> plague is an interesting perspective
[1:32:20] <peachy996> It's entertaining to see your personality confront a game like UT/DR
[1:32:24] <switchbored505> There was a million Deltarune streams last night
[1:32:24] <Murphio_GS> Kinda, yeah
[1:32:43] <sangi53> I still remember when you had that let's play of that weird mech game on your youtube
[1:32:44] <Valgryn> who needs all the others when you can watch Plague play it instead though
[1:32:53] <Murphio_GS> tbh this tune reminds me of gen 4 pokemon specifically
[1:32:59] <+DeadlyPeaks> Your voice is very soothing, I like watching you play games that are dialogue heavy.
[1:33:24] <Murphio_GS> SPEEn
[1:33:40] <Puhff> You shoulda streamed the exact same time Paige did
[1:33:42] <axelkaspar> Sonic time
[1:33:45] <Puhff> for funni
[1:33:57] <tanarath> It will be more of one
[1:33:57] <+BinaryFireball> you're already known so you can probably play whatever you want as long as you are having fun with it
[1:34:03] <+Bucketman42> Happy to finally get to see one of your live streams
[1:34:18] <sangi53> there also tracks from the celeste composer
[1:34:23] <Coystick> There are some BANGERS ahead
[1:34:24] <switchbored505> Line up the arrows with your head
[1:34:35] <Blue_Cornflower> this is very sonic inspired, they spin like sonic when getting on the teacups
[1:34:36] <%Explodincatz> Tobys music is always 11/10
[1:34:43] <switchbored505> Honetly though, this game's music slaps so hard
[1:34:44] <sangi53> elevators are usually just dead time so he added something to do to speed it up I guess
[1:34:45] <tanarath> Line the teacups up the with shadows @plagueofgripes
[1:35:16] <+TQuick101> yeah rub your mits all over Plague
[1:35:18] <Coystick> I'd get into Undertale/Deltarune just for the music if I hadn't already enjoyed it through Paige's streams
[1:35:19] <Murphio_GS> Wikipedia
[1:35:20] <+BinaryFireball> pit fetish unlocked
[1:35:22] <Spagheddies> My grimy P I T S
[1:35:25] <+Urgoslav> my eyes have experienced delta rune, it is time to rub my sweat onto plague
[1:35:32] <+BinaryFireball> the subreddit has ruined me
[1:35:40] <$Charlie99993> I know secrets he doesn't know~
[1:35:45] <beefyhoward> Not gonna backseat! Just here to see you enjoying yourself
[1:35:47] <KaiserMario> I love you Eli...
[1:35:52] <Puhff> I can't wait to tell you how badly you're playing <3
[1:35:57] <+BedHome> yeah basically experience system again
[1:36:09] <peachy996> Watching someone else's first experience with something you experienced is always a good selling point for streamers and lp'ers
[1:36:14] <+BedHome> it does talk about it a little more clearly later if i remember
[1:36:38] <Puhff> Truly a Deltarune miracle
[1:36:49] <Spagheddies> These fuckers are surprisingly cute.
[1:36:53] <rc_ie> Terrasque
[1:36:54] <Spagheddies> Tarrasque.
[1:36:54] <shiny_prinny> tarrasque?
[1:36:55] <+BedHome> Tarasque
[1:37:01] <tanarath> Tarrasque @plagueofgripes
[1:37:03] <Ardailec> Tarrasque
[1:37:03] <Coystick> Larry
[1:37:07] <Puhff> Terrasque
[1:37:12] <Ardailec> The Starcraft Ultralisk?
[1:37:15] <tanarath> It's basically Lavos
[1:37:15] <Murphio_GS> French monster
[1:37:17] <+BedHome> based off a french turtle lion thing from like one tiny french county
[1:37:35] <@Nightbot> Plague is a youtube animator and also streams at https://picarto.tv/Plague . Also: t-shirts! http://goo.gl/lze8QO
[1:37:46] <Puhff> It can be beaten but it's FUCKING RIDICULOUS
[1:37:48] <+BigCoffee> genrate by dodging attackjs
[1:37:50] <Spagheddies> You generate magic by defending, and near hits.
[1:37:51] <+BedHome> Defending and *grazing* enemy bullets gives you tp
[1:37:54] <+VictorVonLouche> TP is earned by defending AND near miss hits when dodging
[1:37:54] <+Ynkubus_> Had a saint tell it to knock its shit off too
[1:37:56] <Murphio_GS> You generate magic points by grazing
[1:37:58] <$Charlie99993> You also get it for grazing
[1:38:04] <+Urgoslav> tomatoConcern
[1:38:13] <switchbored505> In a battle, you generate TP by skimming bullets, which allows you to do special actions.
[1:38:15] <+BedHome> *grazing* is the toho thing where you want to be close enough to the bullets that it lights up the white heart outline around your red heart
[1:38:30] <switchbored505> You can also generate TP by Defending
[1:39:04] <Murphio_GS> It's aight, you dont have to be that good
[1:39:17] <peachy996> Paige managed it fine last night
[1:39:35] <peachy996> You'll do fine, no worries
[1:39:44] <aliasz50> if it makes you feel better that didnt stop Paige
[1:39:55] <Murphio_GS> You can do it as many times as you want, the 5/5 thing is the recruit system mechanic
[1:40:08] <Frogwash> BUT CAN YOU SPELL APPLE
[1:40:12] <+twohitgood> you can do it as many times as you want but the 5/5 times is to recruit them.
[1:40:14] <+BedHome> Ah the "fraction" thing it explained in the tutorial town. When you defeat an enemy a set number of times, they join your "home base town"
[1:40:21] <switchbored505> You have to spare a certain amount of each enemy to "recruit" them to your town. It's not really important.
[1:40:36] <tanarath> @switchbored505 that we know of.
[1:40:57] <switchbored505> We might not know for a while
[1:41:53] <+BedHome> lmao
[1:42:02] <Ardailec> D: MVC2 has been revived
[1:42:03] <Murphio_GS> Children's card game
[1:42:11] <tanarath> ^ best to assume a similar style to Undertale
[1:42:11] <ediblemold> I will challenge you to a childrens card game
[1:42:26] <+BedHome> challenge them to a childrens "game" game
[1:42:38] <$Charlie99993> @PlagueOfGripes How good are you at MVC2, btw, no reason or anything lol ;)
[1:43:35] <Murphio_GS> Susie with the Jojo mindset
[1:43:36] <sangi53> oh god the avatar
[1:43:37] <+BedHome> The Power of Cheating Protagonists flows within you.
[1:43:40] <Futurecity10> Oh god his avatar
[1:43:41] <Puhff> oh god he's dead!
[1:43:42] <+VictorVonLouche> oh that face
[1:43:45] <+EtherealSanity> Kitty is toasted af
[1:43:47] <+BlueLunecy> There's a certain something about vtuber avatars that go dead like that
[1:43:53] <+BedHome> its like his spirit suddenly left the meat puppet
[1:43:53] <+Ynkubus_> LUL
[1:43:55] <peachy996> That's a perfect avatar freak out
[1:44:26] <tanarath> The vtuber avatar looked like it'd taken a huge hit of catnip
[1:44:42] <Spagheddies> It's a small detail, but I love how she capitalizes every word.
[1:44:43] <Murphio_GS> It's punchout
[1:44:44] <Puhff> mmm, yeah gotta love that Kentucky manages to stay hot in late September>:(
[1:45:06] <+BinaryFireball> if it has borderless fullscreen it should fix that
[1:46:00] <Puhff> LUL
[1:46:17] <+RoosterSauces> You can use her muscles
[1:46:18] <switchbored505> This is anime
[1:46:18] <$Charlie99993> It's a transformation sequence
[1:46:19] <peachy996> I just can't get nefarious vibes from Ralsei when he takes the form of a stool
[1:46:22] <+VictorVonLouche> Cause suzie is strong
[1:46:23] <%kyh9> Yes
[1:46:24] <Puhff> Kris is too short to reach the arcade so they are helping
[1:46:25] <Murphio_GS> Transformation sequence
[1:46:26] <Spagheddies> The controls are too hard for you to move.
[1:46:35] <$Charlie99993> They're still too short
[1:46:39] <beefyhoward> Emotional support
[1:46:40] <aliasz50> thats a chapter one reference btw
[1:46:41] <Puhff> INCREDIBLE
[1:46:41] <tanarath> MECHA SHIVA
[1:46:50] <$Valdorick> You're too short and too weak. So the Stool + Arms
[1:46:51] <Spagheddies> PUNCHOUT
[1:46:52] <+VictorVonLouche> punch out
[1:46:58] <MyNameIsRasus> it is
[1:47:06] <+TQuick101> very good Plague, it is
[1:47:20] <Murphio_GS> This is important for later btw
[1:47:36] <tanarath> @plagueofgripes press back to duck
[1:47:42] <terrasonny1> My inner punch out veteran was unleashed in this segment.
[1:47:46] <$Charlie99993> @Murphio_GS please don't talk
[1:47:58] <Murphio_GS> okay

[1:49:36] <+fetrigon> spelled wrong on purpose I think but idk
[1:49:46] <tanarath> It is how it's spelled by kids with bad grammar.

[1:50:55] <switchbored505> These guys look so cool
[1:51:19] <+VictorVonLouche> 400 is a bargain
[1:51:21] <whittacre> 400 is the best value
[1:51:23] <+starhammer_games> buy 400\
[1:51:23] <tanarath> buy 400

[1:51:41] <+starhammer_games> LOL
[1:51:52] <Spagheddies> I didn't say a word.
[1:52:19] <switchbored505> Overpriced
[1:52:54] <+fetrigon> step on it
[1:52:54] <tanarath> No, push button
[1:52:59] <whittacre> they're step plates
[1:52:59] <peachy996> step puzzle
[1:53:01] <Murphio_GS> you'll find out
[1:53:11] <switchbored505> You can walk over them
[1:53:28] <+VictorVonLouche> nah you got this
[1:53:34] <tanarath> No, you still can
[1:54:48] <switchbored505> It's Nubert, the most popular character in Deltarune
[1:55:07] <+fetrigon> Rose's weapon is a scarf
[1:55:12] <$Charlie99993> Nubert was the reason I got into Deltarune in the first place

[1:56:30] <Spagheddies> Hey, for whatever's worth, it's better without a checkmark.
[1:56:34] <sangi53> works like proving the turkish military you are homosexual
[1:56:45] <Spagheddies> There's a reason "OK, Checkmark" is a thing on Twitter.
[1:56:48] <sangi53> (you need to send them pictures of the act)
[1:56:53] <Murphio_GS> I've heard about the turkish military thing
[1:56:57] <Murphio_GS> That's crazy
[1:57:11] <tanarath> Checks quest
[1:57:49] <Spagheddies> Those cats are deceptively cute.

[1:57:58] <Murphio_GS> Pet da kitty
[1:58:32] <tanarath> Yep. Might have been in the tutorial.
[1:58:45] <+VictorVonLouche> spare both now
[1:58:55] <whittacre> there are ACT's that make them tire
[1:58:58] <KaiserMario> Yes
[1:58:59] <Spagheddies> Attacking them enough does.
[1:59:02] <MyNameIsRasus> attacking and some actions
[1:59:41] <Spagheddies> A tasque got stuck, go figure.
[1:59:45] <Murphio_GS> I love that the dancing ugy is in time with the music
[2:00:30] <+TQuick101> More to your fetish
[2:00:46] <LunarRemix> There was an airplane enemy on Undertale
[2:01:07] <MZess> took me like 6 battles to realize they change into doctor costumes when they "take care"
[2:01:15] <Spagheddies> Yeah, the Tsundereplane.
[2:01:49] <Murphio_GS> If you do the X version everyone turns into doctors
[2:01:52] <Coystick> I miss the goat's big hat
[2:02:15] <switchbored505> FYI, you can press a key, back up, and then press it again
[2:02:58] <+V3RTIGO_222> papa plague!
[2:03:02] <Coystick> SHADOW PUZ-Oh
[2:03:34] <+VictorVonLouche> checkmark i think
[2:03:45] <switchbored505> This also counts as a checkmark
[2:03:45] <MZess> nah you needed to do that to unlock something
[2:05:07] <$Rshiners> its a hard disk drive
[2:05:18] <tanarath> Memes?
[2:05:20] <switchbored505> Line up the arrows with your head
[2:05:47] <slix3431> Homestuck made the world worse
[2:05:49] <Murphio_GS> Yeah you have to hit all of them
[2:05:50] <+RoosterSauces> You can go left or right
[2:05:55] <tanarath> Hit all of them
[2:06:08] <switchbored505> Line up the arrows with Kris' head
[2:06:10] <tanarath> You don't have to hold it
[2:06:17] <MZess> ayy, figured it out
[2:06:21] <+BedHome> one more
[2:06:47] <$Valdorick> This IS completable
[2:07:04] <switchbored505> Incredibly, Paige got this one in ONE TRY
[2:07:19] <Coystick> Whatever it is, it's German. So it's probably evil.
[2:07:23] <$Charlie99993> In the original joke from undertale this is from, the puzzle didn't actually have the full 'word'
[2:07:38] <tanarath> This is completeable from at least 1 entrance
[2:08:01] <+V3RTIGO_222> start top left G
[2:08:05] <+V3RTIGO_222> I think
[2:08:34] <tanarath> You can use the same button more than once @plagueofgripes
[2:09:08] <Murphio_GS> No it's fine
[2:09:24] <tanarath> You can stil do it
[2:09:32] <+V3RTIGO_222> oh lol I was way complicating it
[2:09:35] <switchbored505> This is a very novel way to solve it, I never would've thought of it
[2:09:59] <tanarath> Go back to the mouse guy
[2:10:11] <Murphio_GS> tbh I haven't checked back with the hacker
[2:10:22] <+V3RTIGO_222> Elite Gripes
[2:10:47] <tanarath> YEP
[2:11:01] <MZess> I actually got all checkmarks but forgot to go back to that guy lmao
[2:11:20] <tanarath> He's a cursor
[2:12:08] <ZeceDeKobold> Stand in the middle.
[2:12:29] <Coystick> They made Susie's kill face a lot friendlier this time
[2:12:41] <Murphio_GS> Yeah Susie is nice
[2:12:42] <LVL1_Scumbag> All decays with time
[2:13:05] <Coystick> Entropy is a withering pair of earbuds
[2:13:21] <+V3RTIGO_222> I've not played this so I'm curious what even is happening
[2:14:03] <switchbored505> Sounds like a Strong Bad thing
[2:14:15] <$Valdorick> Its on fire, in the image itself.
[2:14:15] <switchbored505> Sweet Cuppin Cakes
[2:14:16] <+Mekhet09> Jesus you have 30k homes around your place?
[2:14:28] <LVL1_Scumbag> I didn't think you could get developed property for 30k
[2:14:46] <Murphio_GS> No internet LUL
[2:14:48] <+V3RTIGO_222> purple cat looks extremely disappointed...
[2:14:55] <$Valdorick> "Just have money, 5head"
[2:15:24] <+Mekhet09> What price range are you going for?
[2:15:41] <ZeceDeKobold> Internet mafia fronts.
[2:15:43] <Murphio_GS> Co-op poggers
[2:16:33] <switchbored505> Yes, this is definitely a Strong Bad reference
[2:16:45] <+Mekhet09> Double moves are stronger.
[2:16:57] <$Valdorick> More value per turn.
[2:17:00] <+BedHome> double moves can hit multiple targets, and not every enemy is one hit only
[2:17:01] <whittacre> it's schwarbage!
[2:17:21] <@Nightbot> Plague is a youtube animator and also streams at https://picarto.tv/Plague . Also: t-shirts! http://goo.gl/lze8QO
[2:17:26] <switchbored505> X moves are good when you have many enemies, because it helps you mercy them all at once
[2:17:38] <+twohitgood> you have to get them all dancing first.
[2:17:40] <whittacre> dance-x will use all your party
[2:18:38] <+jofrankii> yeah this attack is a little intense lol
[2:18:40] <LVL1_Scumbag> Good jorb
[2:22:17] <switchbored505> It seems it doesn't hit them all in this situation. Sorry for the confusion
[2:22:28] <$Valdorick> l-lewd
[2:22:39] <+Mekhet09> I'm pretty ur it's just one super move every 3 turns.
[2:22:56] <+Mekhet09> I think you have to x dance then dance with the target.
[2:23:00] <+Fooguwu> keep fucking them
[2:23:15] <+JGardner03> Keep dancing to the groove
[2:23:34] <switchbored505> I'll be honest, I don't understand how this fight works anymore
[2:23:46] <+Fooguwu> feel the groove plague you gotta FEEL IT
[2:24:37] <mesamus> NO
[2:24:39] <mesamus> keep dancing
[2:24:45] <switchbored505> I dont' think so. Most boss battles you just have to survive until the end
[2:24:46] <mesamus> see
[2:24:52] <mesamus> everyone learns to act
[2:24:57] <+Fooguwu> NEW TECH UNLOCKED
[2:25:08] <+twohitgood> now everyone can act and not just kris.
[2:25:14] <$Valdorick> Their ACTs are half as strong as a solo Kris ACT
[2:25:19] <$Valdorick> ... but not for this fight.
[2:25:33] <switchbored505> Now they can all ACT
[2:25:50] <%HawkGoggles2> it's a bit
[2:26:42] <%kyh9> It feels like there's a lot of one-off gimmick battles in Deltarune
[2:28:34] <+VictorVonLouche> About 6 hours
[2:28:36] <Captain0Punz> Its longer then CH 1
[2:28:37] <+BedHome> Paiges stream was like 8 hours and i dont know if she finished it
[2:28:39] <ScreamLord> @PlagueOfGripes And there's at least 3 more chapters still in the works.
[2:28:44] <LVL1_Scumbag> hot
[2:28:45] <Murphio_GS> It was quite long
[2:28:49] <switchbored505> It's about 6-7 hours
[2:28:50] <jetpack_rorschasch> Paige did, and she's pretty much useless at everything
[2:29:12] <+VictorVonLouche> 3-5 coming next
[2:29:14] <+InhumanMilitia> 5 more yeah
[2:29:55] <switchbored505> No joke, Paige said she was really anxoius and messed up a lot, but she completed the game pretty on a reasonable time, and never died.
[2:30:00] <+VictorVonLouche> There was a couple of baba incidents that slowed her down
[2:30:32] <ScreamLord> Nigel Uno was his real name
[2:30:41] <$Charlie99993> I see Numbah One more with the bald
[2:30:43] <Murphio_GS> Nigel Uno yeah
[2:30:47] <$Charlie99993> And the sunglasses
[2:32:00] <LunarRemix> They're gone after this
[2:32:06] <+twohitgood> yeah, i found they overstayed their welcome.
[2:32:32] <+twohitgood> part of it is that all 3 have to say something with almost every exchange.
[2:32:44] <jetpack_rorschasch> No joke, all my friends were in bands growing up. They never shut the fuck up about how "talented" they were.
[2:33:02] <$Valdorick> Gamer Instincts
[2:33:08] <+twohitgood> looks like you never fused anything?
[2:33:20] <Murphio_GS> Gamer instrincts
[2:33:54] <$Charlie99993> There's a good bit here if you leave and come back
[2:35:27] <$Charlie99993> Consumable for TP
[2:35:27] <+MaxeusTheFirst> MaxeusTheFirst subscribed with Prime. 
[2:35:40] <DragoniusMaximus> all my friends growing up were boring business people, idk how i got lumped in as an artist lol
[2:35:43] <$Charlie99993> But you can also fuse it with something in town
[2:35:52] <+Jonesman64> fake save point character.. nice
[2:36:12] <%MaxeusTheFirst> lol
[2:36:25] <rittergeist> Go "Nyaaaa" every time you ge a sub.
[2:36:34] <Coystick> You need a bespoke hacking animation
[2:36:47] <$Charlie99993> That's a good point, I'm not hearing a lot of nyaas for a cat, plauge
[2:36:49] <%MaxeusTheFirst> Maybe an animation where a bit spits up?
[2:36:56] <$Valdorick> "I'm safe" says the pink lad with the bowler hat... followed by the werewire at the end of the stage having a bowler hat (and the pink guy not being on the screen anymore)
[2:37:05] <+Jonesman64> bit hair ball?
[2:37:18] <%MaxeusTheFirst> Exactly
[2:37:19] <+FadingEmber> Then do it very badly
[2:37:34] <@Nightbot> Plague is a youtube animator and also streams at https://picarto.tv/Plague . Also: t-shirts! http://goo.gl/lze8QO
[2:38:13] <Captain0Punz> i think the up path opened
[2:38:13] <Murphio_GS> What are you trying to do?
[2:38:32] <Murphio_GS> No you went the right way
[2:38:50] <Refermaned> you're done here
[2:38:56] <%MaxeusTheFirst> Can the arrows hit the other enemies?
[2:39:16] <Murphio_GS> No, this was the one that opened up
[2:39:34] <lexitheshark> That section always gave me Sonic vibes
[2:39:51] <+Jonesman64> hover bike level?
[2:40:09] <$Charlie99993> Oh boy, this is a pretty good bit
[2:40:12] <%MaxeusTheFirst> Sonic Casino? I could see it.
[2:40:17] <Coystick> Goddess
[2:40:40] <Treasure_Vault> Yoko Taro?
[2:40:59] <Murphio_GS> Yeah might be
[2:41:03] <mesamus> he said on a blog update he had to restart work on chapter 2 due to maybe switching engines but scrapped that
[2:41:03] <LunarRemix> He also lost a lot of time trying to work with a new engine
[2:41:35] <$Valdorick> King
[2:41:38] <mesamus> king
[2:41:50] <%MaxeusTheFirst> Make lady pretty, but dangerous.
[2:41:53] <$Charlie99993> The King barely even gets any play until the end
[2:42:24] <TubeMan642> During the Thursday stream he talked about having to create a cutscene tool for deltarune
[2:42:29] <Murphio_GS> Yeah it's just stupid
[2:42:44] <$Charlie99993> THERE HE IS
[2:42:48] <$Charlie99993> THERE'S MY BOY
[2:42:52] <DragoniusMaximus> you cant deny that sprite is pure art
[2:42:59] <$Valdorick> Is that B-Tier Super Smash Brothers character, Falco Lombardy!?
[2:43:00] <+Mekhet09> She's a raindeaer
[2:43:17] <$Valdorick> He does.
[2:43:17] <+kewlmyc> No, it's a dragonball scouter
[2:43:19] <mesamus> this song is way better than he deserves it
[2:43:22] <%MaxeusTheFirst> He looks like a rejected DBZ character.
[2:43:29] <$Charlie99993> He's Falco, so they have like a scouter thing
[2:43:31] <Murphio_GS> Yes
[2:43:35] <+fetrigon> yep
[2:43:39] <vladtet909> I think he's supposed to be Falco from the red around his eyes
[2:43:47] <ScreamLord> I thought they were like Elf Ears or something
[2:44:03] <$Valdorick> He's both, infact. Falco *and* Vegeta.
[2:45:20] <+kewlmyc> At least his boss theme is a bop
[2:45:22] <lexitheshark> Nobody likes Burghley
[2:45:34] <Jetsfantasy> Yes he changes automatically
[2:45:36] <mesamus> you bump into him no matter what
[2:46:00] <Refermaned> she has earbuds lol
[2:46:02] <Murphio_GS> Ew I didn't notice when you bump into his cart, it kisses
[2:46:03] <%MaxeusTheFirst> Bumper cars?
[2:46:10] <Murphio_GS> gross gross gross
[2:46:42] <mesamus> stop defending with susie, also use bump with her
[2:47:03] <NaderShahDidNothingWrong> why does he keep bringing up fruit?
[2:47:16] <%MaxeusTheFirst> Maybe its a bird thing?
[2:47:25] <biglomix> 18
[2:47:32] <Jetsfantasy> The X versions are slightly more powerful than doing 3 separate ones
[2:47:39] <mesamus> you'll take forever just bumping with kris
[2:47:44] <$Charlie99993> @mesamus He's using her to feed TP to Ralsei for heals, the it's a reasonable enough strat
[2:47:45] <thumbcut> Eternally in search of the secret  “susie  sits on your face and fucking murders you” ending
[2:48:41] <+fetrigon> you think?
[2:48:45] <Murphio_GS> C does more
[2:48:48] <Murphio_GS> X I mean
[2:48:48] <+Mekhet09> Has anyone done a kill run yet
[2:48:55] <+VictorVonLouche> just damage
[2:48:59] <mesamus> its an attack, it does hp damage but not much in this boss fight
[2:49:08] <Jetsfantasy> @Mekhet09 Yeah, people have. There's violent routes
[2:49:10] <ScreamLord> @PlagueOfGripes Wait, I thought the proper grammatical structure when referring to yourself after someone else was "Blank and I" and "Blank and Me" was the wrong way?
[2:49:16] <Refermaned> does actual damage
[2:49:48] <mesamus> you barely do damage with rude buster, not worth it
[2:49:53] <peachy996> I enjoy this loser very much
[2:50:15] <whittacre> @ScreamLord it's a subject vs object difference. "Blank and I went to the park", "You gave a cake to Blank and Me"
[2:50:32] <ScreamLord> Oh, ok
[2:50:34] <DragoniusMaximus> I havent played all of chapter 2 (got maybe 3 hours in) but i appreciate the amount of animation and setpieces put into it, hope it keeps up for the rest of the game
[2:51:41] <%MaxeusTheFirst> She ded.
[2:51:52] <Jetsfantasy> Yeah, that's why grazing rewards as much TP as it does
[2:52:09] <LunarRemix> Grazing also reduces the duration of enemy's attacks.
[2:53:25] <Jetsfantasy> PogChamp
[2:53:37] <%MaxeusTheFirst> Bird up.
[2:53:51] <Spagheddies> Huge Paige vibes from Queen, NGL.
[2:54:03] <ScreamLord> Computer Magic
[2:54:04] <mesamus> she just dropped the coasters on the rails
[2:54:11] <%MaxeusTheFirst> @Spagheddies It was the laugh, wasnt it. And the gross boots?
[2:54:22] <+fetrigon> game maker tutorial explosion asset LUL
[2:54:40] <mesamus> toby said her laugh is from a sound bit of someone sneezing
[2:54:45] <Spagheddies> @Spagheddies And the way she talks, acts, and overacts.
[2:54:48] <Murphio_GS> It's road trash, not sewer trash, very different
[2:54:56] <+kewlmyc> healing glomp
[2:55:03] <bevyrage> what about gutter trash
[2:55:20] <ScreamLord> Yes
[2:55:22] <$Valdorick> Yes
[2:55:22] <+kewlmyc> 100%
[2:55:22] <biglomix> constantly
[2:55:26] <%MaxeusTheFirst> I'd try...
[2:55:37] <+fetrigon> yes
[2:55:43] <bevyrage> i feel things wouldn't actually change, because we already got idiots going out there and getting crippled for life because they believe the hospital will fix 'em every time
[2:55:45] <Murphio_GS> Skyrim healing training
[2:55:47] <%PleasantLee> people shoot each other because they saw that stacks of paper can stop bullets sometimes
[2:55:48] <%HawkGoggles2> people would be way more reckless
[2:55:55] <biglomix> There was a book a read where no one could die, so it turned into a fetish to kill yourself
[2:56:00] <$Valdorick> Hypochondriac would also be just... fucking worst if healing magic was real..
[2:56:00] <DillionPHCO> That's called taco bell night
[2:56:02] <Treasure_Vault> Ok teach me so i don't do it by accident
[2:56:06] <ScreamLord> In case of emergency
[2:56:06] <%MaxeusTheFirst> If healing magic was real, do you think you could over heal and it could end up like cancer?
[2:56:14] <$Charlie99993> Just good to know things, haha
[2:56:15] <Murphio_GS> Magic in any form is cool
[2:56:49] <Spagheddies> It's candy that's a dark color.
[2:56:50] <Jetsfantasy> It's regular candy in this world
[2:56:56] <%HawkGoggles2> dnoSCOOT dnoSCOOT dnoSCOOT
[2:57:00] <biglomix> spoiled candy
[2:57:18] <+BigNerdSam> forbidden candy from Uncle Dave's friend with the funny cigarettes
[2:57:20] <+Betofall> missed a door
[2:57:22] <Treasure_Vault> Left is usually optional stuff
[2:57:27] <Treasure_Vault> You missed a door
[2:57:36] <$Valdorick> God, they always do this, they always homogenize the class roles in games, like giving everyone Kris' ACT, and Suzie wanting to heal, just to appeal to the casuals  /s
[2:57:50] <Treasure_Vault> The far left room had a door in the darkness that you missed.
[2:57:56] <Bogart420Man> How is your night, Plague?
[2:58:01] <bevyrage> @Valdorick in this instance it fits the themes though
[2:59:23] <Coystick> He's history's greatest monster
[2:59:37] <%MaxeusTheFirst> lol
[2:59:38] <Chester_goes_Berserk> that was a cat-like yawn
