[0:08:03] <stanford_denton> but on that scp you went down or up
[0:08:09] <stanford_denton> not*
[0:08:20] <Neo_Kaiser> I give Plague an R-card.
[0:08:56] <stanford_denton> maybe bad translation?
[0:09:01] <Skeletonmanners> i think the idea is that barett is staring up her skirt?
[0:09:10] <cinless> does she just piss on the stairs?
[0:09:25] <%cosmicleviathan18> afraid of heights?

[0:10:13] <CaerwynMontale> Heya Palgue oathWave
[0:10:17] <CaerwynMontale> Plague*
[0:10:32] <+StormingRLP> Well, he still could see somewhat up her legs. Its not super tight seeing as Tifa uses her legs and arms.
[0:10:34] <CaerwynMontale> oathThink didn't you get past this part last time?
[0:10:39] <stanford_denton> what about elevators?
[0:10:47] <Coystick> I'm here for the upscaled jpgs and dropped frames
[0:10:48] <+Infernal_Dalek> Think of it this way Barret....maybe the helicopter is made of chocolate.
[0:11:01] <JumboManDraws> Tifa wtf
[0:11:05] <stanford_denton> @Infernal_Dalek got that reference
[0:11:08] <%cosmicleviathan18> also tifa shouldn't care if Barret can see up her skirt, they're married aren't they?
[0:11:09] <cureneckbeard> Shinra isn't even wheelchair accessible
[0:11:22] <Shardlab> It's the 90's. It was what we casually called each other
[0:11:29] <Coystick> They call the r word "big baka"
[0:11:32] <CaerwynMontale> Nothing in Midgar is wheelchair accessible
[0:11:33] <JumboManDraws> i bet it was just something like he was being stupid or idiot
[0:11:43] <Neo_Kaiser> I give Tifa the R-card.
[0:11:43] <Coystick> Or "shin baka"
[0:11:58] <+StormingRLP> ...Wait, Cloud and Barret can see Tifa's butt and it moving while she runs ahead of them.
[0:12:08] <Neo_Kaiser> The 90s was the golden times.
[0:12:09] <cureneckbeard> Originally it was the correct medical term
[0:12:36] <stanford_denton> is this some sort of metal gear?
[0:13:03] <Coystick> Tifa shape up, you have to be ready for your meeting with the Italian senate
[0:13:05] <Shardlab> @Neo_Kaiser Hehehehe... no they weren't.

[0:15:08] <JumboManDraws> @PlagueOfGripes was the OST changed somehow? it sounds kind of different
[0:15:25] <CyberDingus> PixelBob shite, missed 15 minutes
[0:16:01] <Katakumo> you can romance barrett?
[0:16:05] <stanford_denton> you can romance in ff7?
[0:16:08] <CaerwynMontale> Yep
[0:16:13] <JumboManDraws> i love everything about 7 but I just dont like the actual battle system
[0:16:14] <CyberDingus> PixelBob Why wouldn't you romance Barrett?
[0:16:19] <%JovianGargoyle> Sweet, made a stream. With new emotes no less. plagueCringe plagueGrapes plagueGun plagueBlind And tiers too? Putting on the vtuber big boy pants I see.
[0:16:19] <Broand> evenin' plague
[0:16:21] <CaerwynMontale> You can go on a date with Barret
[0:16:24] <%cosmicleviathan18> real men goes on the date with Barrett plagueLUL plagueLUL plagueLUL
[0:16:36] <stanford_denton> bros brfore hoes
[0:16:39] <Neo_Kaiser> Aeris is the correct spelling.
[0:16:45] <Katakumo> Bromance â™¥ The true way to happiness
[0:16:58] <%cinless> little known fact, the soldier program actually obliterates object permanence
[0:17:00] <+Draylle> nope, this was mildly annpying
[0:17:00] <JumboManDraws> somewhat, because its not too hard
[0:17:02] <CaerwynMontale> I hated it
[0:17:06] <CaerwynMontale> It was annoying
[0:17:10] <BillieNoMates> its okay
[0:17:11] <Neo_Kaiser> You can go on a date with Aeris, Tifa, Barret or Yuffie.
[0:17:14] <CaerwynMontale> I just fought the enemies
[0:17:16] <Broand> I am tryin' to art and I'm feelin artless augh
[0:17:17] <BillieNoMates> Glad it doesnt matter and you can brute force it
[0:17:18] <Shardlab> I wasn't a stealth game fan yet, so no
[0:17:31] <kaxips06> pog
[0:17:32] <Coystick> Sure, blame us
[0:17:34] <Daxalog> Look at these mech dudes!
[0:17:34] <JumboManDraws> actually i prefer how the Remake does the whole shinra tower part imho
[0:17:44] <Neo_Kaiser> I liked it the first time I did it.
[0:17:56] <BillieNoMates> Its Roller Derby night
[0:18:02] <BillieNoMates> Dont question it
[0:18:05] <%cosmicleviathan18> I mean it looks cool
[0:18:12] <stanford_denton> thougth that was a bug
[0:18:16] <Broand> They put the roller blades are on the front of their foot?
[0:18:17] <rekinom> That's just what peak performance looks like
[0:18:20] <kaoseart> PLAGUE SAMA! \O/
[0:18:37] <Coystick> Oh no, the packets
[0:18:38] <%cinless> radical body modding is always rad
[0:18:38] <CaerwynMontale> There are very few actual human enemies in this game
[0:18:41] <stanford_denton> oh no
[0:18:54] <Neo_Kaiser> I always thought they were robots.
[0:18:59] <Daxalog> Im assume a human is piloting or wearing those things
[0:19:07] <BillieNoMates> Meanwhile in remake, you just brute force your way up the tower
[0:19:09] <kaoseart> chaos
[0:19:18] <kaoseart> Or kao
[0:19:22] <ZwolfDemo> Cheer100
[0:19:29] <%Heart0fInk> Kayo-ken
[0:19:58] <kaoseart> It was mainly because I had an argument with my 2nd grade teacher

[0:20:34] <kaoseart> noice
[0:20:50] <%cinless> something to do with that old giant robots game right?
[0:20:53] <%KellBeII> the bell and baps are a lot of fun
[0:20:55] <CaerwynMontale> HypeTongue HypeHeh these are hype train emotes you get for participating in a  hype train
[0:20:55] <%cinless> yeah that
[0:20:56] <$TheAzulmagia> Ah yes, Metal Gear Shinra.
[0:21:01] <%KellBeII> plagueTaps plagueBell

[0:21:31] <Katakumo> streamer curse. always play games worse than your normal
[0:21:34] <stanford_denton> plagueHarkness  emotes
[0:21:34] <chuca77> Money shot
[0:21:37] <$TheAzulmagia> The weird part is that you get spotted, fight, and then redo the stealth section even though you could just fight your way through at that point.
[0:21:37] <kaoseart> Explotion blast
[0:21:54] <%Punishedkaiger> I'll always remember Big Cums
[0:22:03] <Coystick> You gotta wait like 15 minutes between Big Shots
[0:22:10] <kaoseart> sweet
[0:22:16] <%cosmicleviathan18> dkdiaButt_SG plagueHarkness
[0:22:36] <Broand> Sculpting curvacious anime women in blender is tough, as an unrelated aside
[0:22:37] <%cosmicleviathan18> what emote is it?
[0:22:56] <Shardlab> Emootes usually
[0:23:44] <stanford_denton> @Broand a challange worth taking
[0:23:45] <+Lillowh> yeah the discord channel stuff is kinda gross. Just wait till it's a raffle for emote nft's
[0:23:46] <Neo_Kaiser> How old?
[0:23:47] <%Heart0fInk> They kinda look like gundams
[0:23:53] <%cinless> some streamers encourage viewers to gift subs if they want to  show appreciation beyond a tier 1 sub, i guess that makes sense if tier 3 and such have been shown not to help much
[0:23:57] <JoshManVGH> I like enemies that turn into other enemies mid-fight. That shits cool
[0:24:28] <%cosmicleviathan18> what do you think of the motorcycle minigame?
[0:24:48] <lyrion_q> Getting berated by Barret, fate worse than death
[0:24:51] <JoshManVGH> "We're looking for a spikey haired prisoner, be on the lookout spikey hair man!"
[0:24:54] <%Heart0fInk> Go talk to Chadly Kappa b
[0:24:56] <GMKGoat> Maintenance men
[0:25:04] <kaoseart> I could see him shooting the buttons to go up and down
[0:25:11] <JumboManDraws> i really love this area
[0:25:13] <+StormingRLP> Gun Arm? No, that's a Rivet Gun!
[0:25:15] <JumboManDraws> shinra tower is so cool
[0:25:28] <%cinless> chain rivet gun
[0:26:28] <LunarRemix> I wonder how Barret jacks off or wipes his butt. You can't do that with a gun hand
[0:26:41] <TheSphereHunter> look who it is thesph1THECUT
[0:26:42] <kaoseart> Hey plague, what do you think about a magic staff that is in the form of a mase or hammer cause why not just use the magic of crushing things with hammers?
[0:27:22] <kaoseart> KItty!
[0:27:33] <CaerwynMontale> Nice!
[0:27:37] <stanford_denton> farmer boy
[0:27:38] <+KiwiRedgrave> can he do a big frown
[0:27:40] <+jacewolf_is_the_best> kitty
[0:27:45] <+polothegreatest> woolieSPICE woolieSPICE
[0:27:46] <cureneckbeard> nyannNyan
[0:27:48] <Coystick> Looks quality
[0:27:53] <+Lillowh> Farmer "not a furry" cat
[0:27:57] <BahMozart> Why purple
[0:27:58] <+Lillowh> looks super good
[0:28:06] <%saw6boy> oh damn, in the cafeteria already and no Chadley
[0:28:16] <+KenAshcorp> Story of Seasons and Stardew Valley streams incoming, if the attire is anything to go by
[0:28:23] <Broand> sipsipGasm
[0:28:25] <+KenAshcorp> I love the hat though
[0:28:34] <kaoseart> Elderscrolls magic is only good when modded. Even then
[0:28:40] <+KenAshcorp> It's an integral part of your persona
[0:28:43] <+Draylle> the hunter of Suzi's monkaS
[0:28:43] <Coystick> Spellswords with any weapon that isn't a sword is inherently interesting
[0:28:45] <Daxalog> in each elder scrolls game?
[0:28:50] <%lifeofnotorious> I love the hat
[0:28:53] <TheSphereHunter> do not hunt me!
[0:28:58] <+m3chamike> Elder Scrolls in general is the most generic form of fantasy
[0:28:59] <+Lillowh> Suzi hunter LUL
[0:29:01] <Daxalog> I remember morrowind atleast allow you to fly and walk on water
[0:29:03] <stanford_denton> mundane
[0:29:06] <CaerwynMontale> oathThink. THE KenAshcorp?
[0:29:06] <%KellBeII> she will become the only Suzy, once she hunts the rest
[0:29:08] <%cinless> morrowind magic looks cool, then you hit the endgame and everything has 100% magic resist or reflect
[0:29:10] <CaerwynMontale> oathThink
[0:29:19] <CyberDingus> PixelBob It's like Filthy Frank the Anime Hunter, but for Suzans
[0:29:20] <JoshManVGH> Yep
[0:29:35] <+KiwiRedgrave> did you like dragons dogma?
[0:29:36] <kaoseart> I swear elder scrolls is only good for modding at this point.
[0:29:36] <JoshManVGH> "Fucking tornado!"
[0:29:50] <Coystick> God I love the Mystic Knight
[0:30:06] <%saw6boy> the master spells in Skyrim are kinda like that, not nearly as cool as dragon's dogma but a little more unique than small ball of flame
[0:30:12] <%KellBeII> magic in oblivion and morrowind is a little better.  they let you craft your own spells and combine effects
[0:30:39] <%Heart0fInk> Elder scrolls 3 is slightly more interesting. But only in that some spells like you detect magic or teleport to certain locations based on faith.
[0:30:52] <+m3chamike> Enderal actually takes Skyrim's magic system and makes it pretty good
[0:30:56] <Coystick> Tyranny has an amazing magic system, one of the best I've played
[0:31:03] <stanford_denton> the pathfinder games have a cool magic stuff
[0:31:03] <CaerwynMontale> I really wish they'd hurry up with Skywind
[0:31:03] <Rozalyndis> typical animu. throw a planet at the opponent, it explodes and causes a rupture in the fuckin galaxy and subspace itself violently erupts and melts down. character takes like 20 damage, dusts off their pants, and goes "whaho, i guess i gotta fight serious"
[0:31:05] <GMKGoat> Things!
[0:31:11] <%saw6boy> as bad as the game it, the magic system of two worlds was really cool
[0:31:30] <+KenAshcorp> SILLY BOY
[0:31:34] <+KenAshcorp> I wasn't flirting
[0:31:39] <+KenAshcorp> I was exposition dumping
[0:31:46] <%Lillowh> Lillowh subscribed with Prime. 
[0:32:34] <Rozalyndis> "you're only a 43? i'm a 44. get fucked filthy peasant"
[0:32:42] <kaoseart> I think shinra is actually microsoft
[0:32:43] <%Lillowh> Yeah, actually
[0:32:48] <%Lillowh> you nailed it first time
[0:32:50] <+DrTribal> my southern accent slips out when i drink
[0:33:04] <$TheAzulmagia> Disney is way more evil than Shinra.
[0:33:10] <+jacewolf_is_the_best> the best
[0:33:16] <+m3chamike> Is mine cutesy?
[0:33:17] <passedbourget> mine came from a recaptcha prompt
[0:33:24] <nomolomo> or microsoft, lol
[0:33:25] <%Heart0fInk> Mine is the second because i'm fuckin adorable..
[0:33:40] <Mathochism> I think Pepsi had an actual naval fleet at some point.
[0:33:53] <%Lillowh> Please don't nyaa at me again haha, been a fan since shitstorm 2
[0:33:53] <%cinless> doesn't disney land have fucking AA guns or something?
[0:33:53] <$TheAzulmagia> @Mathochism wew
[0:33:57] <GMKGoat> Does Disney have a secret paramiliary force hidden under WDW?
[0:33:59] <JoshManVGH> The Magic Castle is some giant laser weapon for sure.
[0:34:02] <+KenAshcorp> Probably saw the buster sword
[0:34:03] <nomolomo> thats the cloud expeerience
[0:34:05] <+emperordread> Pretty from far, far from pretty
[0:34:09] <+Draylle> @cinless wait what?!
[0:34:18] <+KenAshcorp> Oh god, this puzzle
[0:34:24] <+KenAshcorp> Oh god please no
[0:34:31] <%Lillowh> lol
[0:34:49] <%cinless> @Draylle i have no source on this, i don't remember if i read this in the context of "yeah it's true" or "snopes debunked this"
[0:34:58] <+KenAshcorp> It's randomized on every New Game, right?
[0:35:05] <%Lillowh> it is?
[0:35:22] <JoshManVGH> What a bullshit way to do a password
[0:35:23] <GMKGoat> Dr. Gast huh
[0:35:25] <+KenAshcorp> Thankfully the sound isn't dropping
[0:35:49] <%JailShmixRemix> Thanks for the gift sub @apatheia
[0:36:15] <Rozalyndis> and since it's kentucky who are you gonna go to otherwise

[0:37:04] <kaoseart> lol boooba
[0:37:18] <$TheAzulmagia> @PlagueOfGripes Is the Mayor still named after Domino's Pizza in the original? I can't recall.
[0:37:19] <castlerock42> Best
[0:37:22] <Rozalyndis> violence solves a *lot* o things
[0:37:24] <+crowmium> peace preservation through fear
[0:37:29] <%cinless> BTK?
[0:37:43] <nomolomo> this puzzle really fucked me over back in the day as a non native english speaker
[0:38:02] <$TheAzulmagia> Pizza Hut, I heard.
[0:38:31] <$TheAzulmagia> I presume there's also some other guy in this organization named Little Caesar's.
[0:39:20] <passedbourget> bootie
[0:39:32] <%KellBeII> I could really go for a pan pizza rn
[0:39:36] <Rozalyndis> dominos if you're starving but not if you can help it
[0:39:38] <JoshManVGH> Plaguecast!
[0:39:39] <%Lillowh> Dominos always sounds sorta okay
[0:39:44] <%Lillowh> and never much past that
[0:39:47] <CaerwynMontale> I love Domino's
[0:40:01] <CaerwynMontale> The thin crust pizza is great
[0:40:02] <GMKGoat> Does P'hut still do personal pans? I haven't had one of those since like 2nd grade
[0:40:13] <+DrTribal> ahh Papa "working that n word out of my system" john
[0:40:18] <JoshManVGH> It's also so expensive for fast food pizza.
[0:40:19] <$TheAzulmagia> ^
[0:40:21] <%Lillowh> He ate 40 pizzas in 30 days
[0:40:21] <%Heart0fInk> Had Dominos for the first time last week. It was pretty okay..
[0:40:31] <CyberDingus> PixelBob He quoted. And he got cancelled. Dirty.
[0:40:32] <chuca77> they also have difficulties making a pizza that isnt absolute shit
[0:40:35] <Rozalyndis> i never cared for papa john's sauce
[0:40:40] <$TheAzulmagia> I've never been big on Papa John's. The only pizza I liked was John's Favorite and it was super greasy.
[0:40:45] <chuca77> now? it did years ago
[0:40:45] <%Lillowh> Yeah you're super right
[0:40:46] <+polothegreatest> "rapture is coming" -papa john DarkMode
[0:40:58] <%Lillowh> It used to be a different type of fast food pizza
[0:41:06] <%Lillowh> now it tastes like pizza hut
[0:41:11] <CaerwynMontale> Okay then, what pizza place do you like?
[0:41:20] <+DrTribal> man i hate pizza hut
[0:41:38] <+crowmium> Domino's is the best thing we have locally
[0:41:51] <+emperordread> ponder that fact
[0:41:52] <Pistofficer> do we still make jokes about the length of plague's fence or is that too old now :(
[0:42:01] <%KellBeII> plagueTaps
[0:42:06] <GMKGoat> We only make jokes about the height now
[0:42:07] <$TheAzulmagia> That reminds of Stella Glow having a sort-of Materia system called Orbs.

[0:42:59] <GMKGoat> Nice
[0:43:32] <%Explodincatz> oh u cant save anywhere? lame
[0:43:51] <CaerwynMontale> Is the mayor in the remake? I haven't played it yet
[0:43:54] <$TheAzulmagia> Mayor Domino, and his subordinates Hart, John, Caesar, and Chucky.
[0:43:56] <$TheAzulmagia> @CaerwynMontale Yee.
[0:44:08] <CaerwynMontale> oathThumbsUp
[0:44:11] <nomolomo> a literal tool
[0:44:15] <%Lillowh> Different mayor Kappa
[0:45:03] <%Heart0fInk> He's a sock puppet figurehead
[0:45:51] <EngiNierXII> I never actually watched your Twitch, have you always been a vtuber?
[0:46:15] <kaoseart> Dayum girl you verify good
[0:46:20] <CaerwynMontale> Gotta talk to the computer first
[0:46:23] <$TheAzulmagia> Shinra is just weird.
[0:46:41] <%Heart0fInk> I mean.. if it doesn't pan out just turn this into an LP. i wouldn't blame you.
[0:46:42] <lyrion_q> employment benefits
[0:46:45] <%Lillowh> the computer always felt condescending
[0:46:45] <GMKGoat> To verify your keycard
[0:46:57] <$TheAzulmagia> @PlagueOfGripes I like to imagine that Hojo isn't even really a scientist. He's just an asshole that owns a labcoat and Shinra said "close enough" gave him a research grant.
[0:47:01] <+LooglePlatinum> no not the net
[0:47:08] <+FingaLights> Something strange? Has to be Hojo

[0:47:32] <Rozalyndis> you're doing this "nyeees" kinda thing like that dude from the simpsons sakuLUL
[0:48:20] <+askalta> an asshole in a lab coat is just a scientist
[0:48:42] <%Lillowh> "what if science, but sexual assault" -Hojo
[0:48:57] <$TheAzulmagia> @Lillowh Pretty much.
[0:49:05] <fast_and_curiouss> i was thinking about you today plague and you streamed today , wierd coincidence
[0:49:11] <$TheAzulmagia> I don't remember this, either.

[0:49:17] <%Lillowh> sure doesn't
[0:49:29] <%Lillowh> kinda gets refenced in the tunnel section
[0:49:30] <CaerwynMontale> Most people skipped it cause it was a pain
[0:49:52] <kaoseart> Hmm kinky
[0:50:03] <Rozalyndis> sexual tension? in a japanese game? perish the thought
[0:50:05] <GMKGoat> A good time is had by all
[0:50:14] <+D4C_Trice> they do go up an elevator or the stairs
[0:50:37] <%Heart0fInk> and she crinkles her feet to the camera...
[0:50:44] <+walternatorz> There's the Domino scene and the VR scene
[0:50:58] <+D4C_Trice> that boss fight on the bike sucked
[0:51:08] <+D4C_Trice> because of the awful camera angle
[0:52:34] <kaoseart> We all be dumb sometimes
[0:52:54] <%Heart0fInk> Ummmmm her name is pronounced Tiffa!

[0:54:17] <$TheAzulmagia> "An Ultimate Weapon for Cait Sith? Haha, no one uses him!" - Cloud
[0:54:30] <CaerwynMontale> Cait Sith's final weapon is in the locker room
[0:54:52] <GMKGoat> Can't believe this cait sith bullying
[0:54:58] <$TheAzulmagia> So why is Cait Sith's Ultimate Weapon here, anyway? Did Reeve just forget it in his locker?
[0:55:07] <chuca77> Isn't there also only one chance to get it in the whole game
[0:55:07] <CaerwynMontale> Yeeeah, he's not really a useful character
[0:55:14] <Broand> Another loss for irish mythological references
[0:55:20] <$TheAzulmagia> I think it's Ket Shee.
[0:55:28] <$TheAzulmagia> Or something like that.
[0:55:40] <%KellBeII> plagueBell
[0:55:41] <%TheresAGoff> Kai Shee?

[1:12:55] <%KellBeII> yeah, their actual goal is kinda bizarre
[1:13:03] <+m3chamike> To be fair, this plan tracks really well with modern Big Corporations
[1:13:14] <Zakaraz> corporation are incredibly short sighted? no
[1:13:15] <+crazyspartan214> He's probably an alien
[1:13:56] <$TheAzulmagia> How did Palmer ever manage to get into such a high ranking position?
[1:13:59] <%kandoh> plagueBell
[1:14:01] <$TheAzulmagia> He seems like a complete moron.
[1:14:03] <+m3chamike> I could definitely see Amazon, EA, etc making this plan
[1:14:03] <YumiTigress> Palmer would look like aged George Costanza
[1:14:20] <%TheresAGoff> Reeve would defend Elon Musk on twitter
[1:14:20] <Coystick> Such a good, well behaved, quiet dog. Must be nice
[1:14:25] <+emperordread> Like Gluttony from FMA

[1:16:06] <TheMoenia> aeris is apperantly INCREDIBLY inbred if she is 82 percent the same as her mom

[1:16:34] <%cooldude69xx> I like imagining all of Baretts symbol swears are really G-rated
[1:16:46] <$TheAzulmagia> See, this is only furthering my theory about Hojo. LUL
[1:16:53] <%cooldude69xx> Like "jerk" or "butthead"
[1:17:20] <+walternatorz> maybe they're considering recessive traits that aren't present?
[1:17:34] <chuca77> That's how long it will take to go through all of his fetishes
[1:17:39] <$TheAzulmagia> ^
[1:17:43] <+crazyspartan214> the are missing something maybe?
[1:18:26] <$TheAzulmagia> This reminds me of PokÃ©mon Sword/Shield having a villain who is REALLY ANGRY that in 1000 years there will be an energy crisis, so he's going to bring about the apocalypse now.
[1:18:30] <chuca77> "Research"
[1:18:34] <kaoseart> Just say 2

[1:20:42] <$TheAzulmagia> It really says a lot that it's not even the weirdest or worst thing Hojo has done.
[1:21:12] <Daxalog> Ive seen the art. Its possible
[1:21:13] <+emperordread> Is this a case of 'The Writer's barely disguised fetish'?
[1:21:14] <Badlangug> he just wants a talking dog, whats wrong with that
[1:21:14] <%Arsenic_8> hojo is a scientist though, gotta trust science
[1:21:15] <kaoseart> It's like trunks going back in time to warn about the androids but with his penis
[1:21:15] <chuca77> Just your average Japanese scientist
[1:21:30] <%Heart0fInk> Bestiality is cute says Japan..
[1:21:34] <$TheAzulmagia> Reeve: Bruh.
[1:21:58] <+m3chamike> This is not research, Hojo is just a freak
[1:22:01] <$TheAzulmagia> ^
[1:22:11] <+StormingRLP> Orcs???
[1:22:28] <kaoseart> No it would work in the rule 34 reality XD
[1:22:43] <Mathochism> The writer's barely disguised fetish.
[1:22:43] <%TheresAGoff> Like this is techno future. Just take an egg from Aeris. Take a few. And then Test Tube baby that shit.

[1:23:49] <CyberDingus> shinomiThink Porn in this universe is weird
[1:23:52] <+StormingRLP> This is just reminding me of the Machinabridge of Red XIII mentioning that he has had a lot of sex due to Hojo's "experiments".
[1:24:16] <+scerpico> Hojo does apparently get results vis a vis making monsters so maybe they just kind of assume he knows what he's doing?
[1:24:19] <$TheAzulmagia> @PlagueOfGripes Didn't I say that earlier? LUL
[1:24:30] <%Explodincatz> hot
[1:24:35] <Badlangug> hojo puts the mad in scientist
[1:24:37] <+m3chamike> So they're Activision/Blizzard?
[1:24:39] <Schuhart> Good meeting
[1:24:41] <kaoseart> @StormingRLP You mean the team 4 star one?
[1:24:53] <+illoonar> retroSMILE natural breeding
[1:24:53] <%acridpaladin> she can smell clud's hairgel
[1:25:04] <$TheAzulmagia> Hojo is absolutely filming pornography.
[1:25:10] <+StormingRLP> @StormingRLP Yes. That series was a blast.
[1:25:24] <chuca77> Barret was ripping ass in the vent the whole time
[1:25:42] <+StormingRLP> ...Y'know, I highly doubt Red XIII was asked.
[1:25:45] <%Heart0fInk> I would actually buy that as a mega corporation..
[1:25:47] <+emperordread> ESPECIALLY film into
[1:25:55] <chuca77> Red XIII demanded
[1:25:56] <%Heart0fInk> just a BUNCH of sex perverts
[1:25:56] <Coystick> He can SMELL IT
[1:26:05] <%acridpaladin> i doubt hojo knows. hes just gonna make em fuck til it works
[1:26:14] <$TheAzulmagia> I feel like Hojo probably just threw them in a cell together and was like "Okay, now do the sex."
[1:26:19] <kaoseart> Red 13 could have said no and then just shit happened
[1:26:24] <+StormingRLP> PLAGUE! We are spiraling! We gotta stop!
[1:26:26] <CyberDingus> plagueNet
[1:26:26] <kaoseart> so red even got raped...
[1:26:28] <kaoseart> lol
[1:26:32] <%Heart0fInk> I like that the stream is stable for the bestiality talk..
[1:26:37] <%KellBeII> red squad
[1:26:43] <%Heart0fInk> Not the actual gameplay tho. no no no...
[1:26:44] <%acridpaladin> my only thought about it was hojo wanted furries to be real
[1:26:46] <kaoseart> He was the one putting it in and he is also the one...
[1:26:46] <+TQuick101> fucked up lil nasty game
[1:26:49] <chuca77> This is the wonderful conversation I came here for VoHiYo
[1:26:50] <+m3chamike> Okay, but Plague, I can totally see a big Corporation being this dumb RIGHT NOW
[1:26:56] <Coystick> See, this is why I stick to FF8, wholesome, healthy FF8.
[1:27:10] <%Lillowh> honestly, i kinda respect the writer for convincing the rest of the staff to put his fetish scenario into the game, it's like the gwynevere artist
[1:27:17] <kaoseart> lol
[1:27:20] <%Lillowh> it's almost impressive
[1:27:38] <chuca77> Keep talking about dog knots
[1:27:55] <+StormingRLP> @Lillowh Oh yeah, I heard something about that. What happened with Gwynevere?
[1:28:18] <JoshManVGH> Turns out your ISP is trying to control your content via throttling.
[1:28:23] <Coystick> Upscaled, interpolated bestiality
[1:28:42] <%Lillowh> The artist drew her basically how she appears, and miyazaki wasn't a fan but the artist was apparently so proud of his work that miyazaki didn't have the heart to tell him no
[1:28:43] <JoshManVGH> "He's not talking about dog dick? Cut the bitrate!"
[1:28:47] <%Heart0fInk> Red 13 rocket
[1:28:52] <kaoseart> Oh god... Cloud and zack and hojo

[1:28:55] <kaoseart> Xd
[1:29:01] <HawkGoggles2> Hojo shows up to the basement as often as a dead beat dad
[1:29:02] <Eger007> the net wants to censor bestiality talk
[1:29:04] <+StormingRLP> @Lillowh Wow.
[1:29:20] <chuca77> Did Cloud see Red XIII's red rocket?
[1:29:23] <Coystick> Throttle my dicc lmao
[1:29:43] <%acridpaladin> oh fun
[1:30:00] <bathesinrust> I had no idea ff7 got this weird, I thought plague was joking when he mentioned this earlier
[1:30:00] <%acridpaladin> thats actually worse then comcast. im impressed
[1:30:03] <chuca77> Good old reginal monopolies
[1:30:11] <+crowmium> what about satellite?
[1:30:12] <chuca77> regional
[1:30:32] <%KellBeII> oh goodness, i just hop'd onto my PC to watch the stream and my phone was like a full minute behind
[1:30:37] <kaoseart> In NewYork there are only two internet companies. They are so connected that it's like a manopoly. In the end, they pass us from back and forth like a piggy bank.
[1:31:06] <kaoseart> So every once in a while they just jack up the price.
[1:31:31] <chuca77> @kaoseart That's pretty much the entire country, they might be more than two but the other choices are so bad it's pointless to get them
[1:31:43] <%KellBeII> when the fiber finally gets installed, Eli will be unleaashed
[1:31:45] <kaoseart> yup
[1:31:59] <+TQuick101> Is there a non=weird final fantasy?
[1:32:18] <+crowmium> At what point do you move because the internet quality is affecting your job?
[1:32:38] <%Heart0fInk> You can steal Bagels from them?
[1:32:40] <$TheAzulmagia> @tquick101 XII maybe?
[1:32:46] <%Heart0fInk> you monster..
[1:33:10] <$TheAzulmagia> Aside from the Illuminati ghosts, XII is fairly mundane high fantasy.
[1:33:23] <%Heart0fInk> @TQuick101 No? they're all hyper fantasy garbage.
[1:33:32] <Badlangug> where's hojo's porn camera?
[1:33:59] <%Rezca> Hojo... do you really understand genetics?
[1:34:02] <wiDOPANos> why can't I hold all of these frames!? says plague's internet
[1:34:06] <chuca77> Who says she isn't consenting?
[1:34:14] <%acridpaladin> tifa no you have to save yourself for the italians
[1:34:29] <%octotasty> it's extra weird when you find Hojo just chilling in a beach
[1:34:29] <+crowmium> Little does she know, she's part of the experiment
[1:34:30] <%lemoan> why she bent over like that!?
[1:34:34] <HawkGoggles2> shared pain
[1:34:35] <kaoseart> Be funny if cloud is a replacement for red for these experments.
[1:34:40] <chuca77> TIFA YES
[1:34:43] <%Lillowh> yjk
[1:34:45] <kaoseart> Lol
[1:34:46] <Eger007> better eye-nipple
[1:34:50] <$TheAzulmagia> shrkThinking
[1:34:53] <+crazyspartan214> is that an eye on the nipple?
[1:34:58] <Tohellwithvegetarianism> nice nipple
[1:35:01] <$TheAzulmagia> Yee.
[1:35:08] <chuca77> Is he gonna fuck that too?
[1:35:08] <$JobbedBone> LUL like ff6 yeah
[1:35:17] <kaoseart> Aris now breaking the door down for the experiment to start now.
[1:35:51] <MarylandJutsu> Where its f****ing head
[1:36:10] <$TheAzulmagia> Based
[1:36:21] <%lemoan> You watch the abridged ff7. Because yes it's basically Hojo's fetish.
[1:36:25] <MarylandJutsu> Barret is a top tier charecter
[1:36:38] <MarylandJutsu> also my good son Red......I would die for him
[1:36:58] <chuca77> Barret sees hoorible abominations against god and says "That's stupid"
[1:37:03] <+emperordread> If Red has performance anxiety, do Shinra send a fluffer?
[1:37:13] <$TheAzulmagia> Barret sees The Thing and just doesn't give a single fuck.
[1:37:19] <%lemoan> @emperordread send a WHAT!?
[1:37:20] <MarylandJutsu> Barret is like "what ever this is? want NOTHING to do with it." and its like......relateable
[1:37:27] <$TheAzulmagia> @emperordread whyyyyy
[1:37:41] <%Heart0fInk> I wish remake was about the Jenova is sephiroth plot line..
[1:37:49] <MarylandJutsu> Hojo is what you call.....f***ed up
[1:37:57] <%Heart0fInk> or sephiroth is jenova.. whatver
[1:38:04] <%acridpaladin> naw. we all know hojo just wants to make furries real.
[1:38:04] <Schuhart> plagueHarkness plagueHarkness
[1:38:18] <chuca77> YAY SCIENCE
[1:38:20] <+ikantreeed> My friends how are u doing
[1:38:34] <MarylandJutsu> hojo truly is a fucking nightmare
[1:38:34] <$TheAzulmagia> Kinda weird to think that the Wall Market pimp wasn't the most deviant character in Midgar.
[1:38:44] <+crazyspartan214> we were too young to know
[1:38:48] <kaoseart> No no. Here is another question. If he does this shit. Wouldn't that just fuck the setra out of aris?! Fucker would destroy setra just by fucking it out of their experiment.
[1:38:52] <chuca77> I played this game when I was like 7 and absolutely loved it, starting to wonder about myself
[1:38:53] <kaoseart> Plague!
[1:39:07] <kaoseart> They would just fuck the setra out of her bloood
[1:39:15] <kaoseart> Its so fucking stupid
[1:39:25] <kaoseart> Cause of genetics
[1:39:35] <kaoseart> Hojo you dumbass
[1:39:47] <MarylandJutsu> NaH we will kill you anyways hojo
[1:40:39] <$TheAzulmagia> Logic in VII. Hahaha.
[1:41:05] <%Engwithan_Elder_God> Let's see how this goes.
[1:41:08] <MarylandJutsu> also just SAMPLE
[1:41:10] <%Arsenic_8> is this how pokemon are made
[1:41:11] <chambatron> Lowkey donkey shows from Mexico
[1:41:17] <kaoseart> Tiffa: Hold on hojo pass the popcorn
[1:41:18] <+emperordread> Is this like in Clerks 2 when they get the donkey show?
[1:41:29] <MarylandJutsu> Hojo f*** off
[1:41:31] <%Traximus_V> his tail is going wild
[1:41:35] <HawkGoggles2> I don't like this kinky voice over Kappa Kappa
[1:41:37] <chuca77> That's what makes it hot
[1:41:39] <$JobbedBone> Hojo isn't the best scientist LUL he just likes to push his glasses up
[1:41:47] <$TheAzulmagia> It's even weirder that Hojo is just going to watch this.
[1:41:48] <YumiTigress> Human League's "Human" plays for emphasis
[1:41:50] <%Engwithan_Elder_God> LUL
[1:41:55] <%Rezca> be "feral"
[1:41:57] <chambatron> Procreate
[1:42:01] <Schuhart> Tear shit up. All the shirtt
[1:42:20] <$JobbedBone> bring the species back? LUL
[1:42:21] <chambatron> RED ROCKET
[1:42:26] <YumiTigress> His b-hole puckering in anticipation
[1:42:33] <chambatron> Red Rocket 13
[1:42:43] <HawkGoggles2> Damn, future me has to STFU now
[1:42:44] <%Arsenic_8> when life gives you lemons
[1:42:45] <Schuhart> No, no. Keep going Eli, heh heh heh
[1:42:46] <%Lillowh> I mean worst case, he gets to nut
[1:43:00] <MarylandJutsu> Barret uses GUN
[1:43:01] <%Lillowh> he gets off scott free regardless
[1:43:14] <tubit> he shot aeris :O
[1:43:15] <kaoseart> berret is not happy for r34
[1:43:18] <chuca77> Barret is NOT into that shit
[1:43:42] <MarylandJutsu> RIP HIS THROAT OUT NANAKI
[1:43:47] <%Rezca> how is he not dead here?
[1:43:48] <disgustingmage> not as much as the italian senate?
[1:43:48] <HawkGoggles2> Hojo gets to live after this, messed up
[1:43:53] <chuca77> aND NOW HE'S GETTING THE RED ROCKET
[1:44:00] <YumiTigress> How does Hojo's jugular live through this?
[1:44:01] <+xen0riddley> How does Hojo live through this...
[1:44:15] <+crazyspartan214> hyperbolic time chamber?
[1:44:17] <kaoseart> The higher-ups saw this and was like. "The fuck!" So berret.
[1:44:17] <$TheAzulmagia> If only Nanaki killed him.
[1:44:18] <%Rezca> is he just nuzzling him?
[1:44:21] <%Traximus_V> hojo survives a mauling
[1:44:30] <$JobbedBone> plan b
[1:44:38] <kaoseart> You mean Plan D
[1:44:38] <$JobbedBone> Kappa
[1:44:39] <%JovianGargoyle> plagueHarkness
[1:44:49] <$TheAzulmagia> Possibly.
[1:44:54] <%Heart0fInk> Berret is the ultimate cock blocker
[1:45:07] <$TheAzulmagia> I think Hojo likes using the word specimen too much.
[1:45:14] <$TheAzulmagia> shrkThinking
[1:45:15] <+crazyspartan214> Tifa
[1:45:15] <chuca77> Barret
[1:45:16] <smile64> red talked to it during lunch breaks in the lab prison cafeteria
[1:45:31] <kaoseart> Berret as tiffa would be the one with red
[1:45:36] <kaoseart> oh noo...
[1:45:52] <smile64> big sis tifa takes care of everyone
[1:45:53] <%Rezca> Oh boi
[1:45:54] <Coystick> RED 14
[1:45:56] <+crazyspartan214> hnyO

[1:46:40] <$JobbedBone> adumN1 adumN2
[1:46:41] <$JobbedBone> adumN3 adumN4
[1:46:45] <$JobbedBone> ki
[1:46:46] <Coystick> Call him Clifford the big red rape lion
[1:47:04] <CyberDingus> PixelBob Nice name
[1:47:17] <$TheAzulmagia> I hope remake changes his name to Nanaki permanently once they get to Cosmo Canyon.
[1:47:23] <%Traximus_V> "your name is nanaki? I thought it was nanaki."
[1:47:32] <@Nightbot> Plague is a youtube animator and also streams at https://picarto.tv/Plague . Also: t-shirts! http://goo.gl/lze8QO
[1:47:36] <freelancer_jack> its not as weird as the average pat stream
[1:47:39] <%lemoan> Barrets beard and tatoo don't glow green.
[1:47:56] <$TheAzulmagia> Calling him Red XIII seems really gross somehow.
[1:48:14] <chuca77> @TheAzulmagia Because that's his porn name
[1:48:22] <%Heart0fInk> this has been a weird knotty stream.. plagueHarkness
[1:48:23] <$JobbedBone> reminds me of those black waltz mages
[1:48:34] <Coystick> Birkin ass Resident Evil boss.
[1:48:35] <cureneckbeard> nyaa
[1:48:52] <$TheAzulmagia> @chuca77 Yee.
[1:49:59] <StrangeCoincidence> did plague play the remake and what did he think of it?
[1:50:07] <$TheAzulmagia> shrkThinking
[1:50:08] <%lemoan> In FF7 So far we've had Tseng stalking a 8-10 year old girl and an almost beastiality scene...This game is something ain't it.
[1:50:25] <%lemoan> @StrangeCoincidence He has. He's doesn't like it.
[1:50:30] <LunarRemix> Tifa be horny
[1:50:33] <+emperordread> MANY ways
[1:50:39] <StrangeCoincidence> cloud and pals get out of the car and physically fight destiny. it's pretty horrid
[1:50:39] <YumiTigress> Pretty sure it's bad translation
[1:50:42] <StrangeCoincidence> makes sense
[1:50:46] <CyberDingus> PixelBob eyebrow wiggle
[1:50:47] <freelancer_jack> Tifa wtf
[1:50:51] <%Engwithan_Elder_God> Did Tifa check her out?

[1:51:17] <kaoseart> Tiffa on the otherhand

[1:51:36] <$TheAzulmagia> shrkThinking
[1:51:50] <freelancer_jack> they forgot to blind fold him on the way in, duh
[1:51:53] <HawkGoggles2> "it was just a joke"
[1:52:07] <$TheAzulmagia> Merely pretending.
[1:52:08] <chuca77> You
[1:52:16] <JoshManVGH> "I'd have tapped that if you crawled on the ground more"
[1:52:17] <%Lillowh> N U T
[1:52:31] <%Lillowh> as a joke
[1:52:45] <$TheGuesty> Just a prank bro!
[1:52:45] <%lemoan> merely a bit of tomfoolery
[1:52:46] <CyberDingus> PixelBob Just a prank
[1:52:51] <freelancer_jack> that implies other things Plague
[1:52:55] <chuca77> Hojo is like "you traitor this was your idea."
[1:53:11] <freelancer_jack> Plague are you suggesting Red 13 assualted hojo at full mast
[1:53:18] <freelancer_jack> answer the quesion Plague
[1:53:24] <$TheAzulmagia> Ah, the Irvine approach.
[1:53:26] <CyberDingus> PixelBob Yes, Plague. Answer.
[1:53:29] <%lemoan> @freelancer_jack wouldn't expect any less
[1:53:59] <freelancer_jack> If he's gonna bring up unreasonable implications WE MUST DRAW UNREASONABLE CONCLUSIONS XD
[1:54:03] <$TheAzulmagia> To be fair, I'm sure Vincent would be at full must while mailing Hojo as well.
[1:54:10] <$TheAzulmagia> *mast
[1:54:11] <%TheresAGoff> Yeah I fuckin would be that silly
[1:54:15] <%TheresAGoff> I was like 7
[1:54:16] <%Heart0fInk> get them as far away from the horny animal as you can.
[1:54:40] <chuca77> You can't stop the red rocket
[1:54:49] <freelancer_jack> ha
[1:54:57] <$TheAzulmagia> You know where the 66th Floor elevator is, right? It's on the 66th Floor!
[1:55:05] <$TheAzulmagia> Thanks, Nanaki
[1:55:19] <%octotasty> Blue Magic
[1:55:51] <Coystick> But I have been BAAAAD~
[1:56:01] <HawkGoggles2> All of Hojo employees would be super horny.
[1:56:02] <freelancer_jack> I imagine the staff is super jaded with all hojos weird sex shit at this point.
[1:56:06] <YumiTigress> '96 in Japan, '97 in North America
[1:56:07] <$TheAzulmagia> Blue Magic best magic.
[1:56:10] <freelancer_jack> this is just their 9 to 5
[1:56:18] <+KiwiRedgrave> i was in my fathers balls
[1:56:19] <freelancer_jack> it brings no pleasure any more
[1:56:27] <TheMoenia> i was born
[1:56:40] <+drago3795> hey ff7 and plague 2 of my favorite thing
[1:56:52] <freelancer_jack> the blood line dies with you
[1:56:52] <kaoseart> Bring ladies like tiffa though.
[1:56:53] <Coystick> Chick LOVE Red 13 tho
[1:56:56] <kaoseart> :p
[1:56:57] <mongorific> plAUge! you're a catch my guy
[1:57:01] <Coystick> Chicks* plural
[1:58:02] <BahMozart> What will stealing do
[1:58:19] <chuca77> You can't just loot it off their corpse, gotta insult them by taking it right the fuck off them in a middle of a fight
[2:00:01] <Coystick> What's blue magic?
[2:00:39] <$TheAzulmagia> XIV eventually made it decent after a bad introduction, but making it Limited is a shame.
[2:01:09] <$TheAzulmagia> @coystick Learning powers from enemies.
[2:02:07] <%lemoan> He's just straight up using a lance
[2:02:09] <chuca77> They're uses lances as a sword
[2:02:10] <LunarRemix> That line of thought doesn't make much sense when Cid exists as a normal regular dude who's starting level is usually stronger than a 2nd SOLDIER
[2:02:11] <$TheAzulmagia> Blue Mage is cool, but you usually don't have an indication which enemies teach spells.
[2:02:13] <Coystick> Oh neat, not enough of that in crpgs/wrpgs
[2:02:16] <chuca77> using
[2:02:34] <$TheAzulmagia> So it's hard to figure out when to look for abilities without a guide, aside from Bravely Default and Bravely Second.
[2:03:13] <+StormingRLP> So, you're telling me, that the Motor Ball could run out MP?
[2:03:39] <%octotasty> I think Spirit affects Steal Chance in 9? I forget
[2:04:41] <Skeletonmanners> Harde Je
[2:04:46] <$TheAzulmagia> I think VII has my favorite Blue Magic selection of spells.
[2:04:51] <$TheAzulmagia> Lots of strong stuff.
[2:05:00] <BahMozart> Huzzah! Theft!
[2:06:26] <TechGFennec> Hello
[2:06:28] <kingra> It was too big too heavy to be a sword

[2:08:04] <Skeletonmanners> they look like a sonic enemy
[2:08:11] <Skeletonmanners> weird platypus ball robot
[2:08:13] <%Punishedkaiger> I remember it took a couple weeks to get to HR 100 in World
[2:08:17] <+Kaask> I see. I haven't played Rise as much as World. About 60h on Switch, about 20? on PC so far.
[2:08:32] <+goatbrogaming> World gave out a lot less EXP for hunts
