[0:19:24] <DougintheTrench> It's also possible Plague just doesn't care.
[0:19:26] <Frogwash> Twitch is very much not okay with licensed music, but the most they do is mute the stream vod
[0:19:41] <+DrawinglikeaSir> Oh, you're not talking? :/
[0:19:42] <silenthillbookofmammaries> k, i always thought it was twitch didn't like music, but picarto gave zero fucks

[1:18:40] <+KevinsLunchbox> Do you think Coco would go to the pioneer festival and the barn dance that night?
[1:18:40] <bigunclebungus> lewd? i dont understand
[1:19:09] <+TaylOctopus91> @jiggy_snipe I thought only the copyrighted stuff gets muted, not the whole VOD

[1:20:52] <TheAntitype> I remember replaying Coco's levels in Warped over and over, they were always my favorites.
[1:21:04] <DougintheTrench> Yeah, he was playing music from Akira and somehow only GranGran knew what it was from.
[1:21:28] <JohnClaggart> I was half right https://www.crashmania.net/images/encyclopedia/locations/crash-house/variations-2.jpg
[1:21:30] <DougintheTrench> Everyone else was just confused what a Chinese guy was doing there.
[1:21:51] <DougintheTrench> I always thought Crash and Coco just lived on that stupid beach you first see them in.
[1:22:04] <professorno> That was really weird when this played at the end of Uncut gems

[1:35:09] <TrashQueenNyx> Audrey could have been such a better character, oi.
[1:36:33] <%JJCheeker> There is like a 4 hour long YouTube video about the meaning behind Twin Peaks
[1:36:43] <%JJCheeker> I wanna watch it but damn it's gonna take awhile
[1:37:36] <+tokenreefer> I have a hard time with it. Because film is so much more literal in my mind with abstract undertones. this was out in left field
[1:38:08] <TheAsylumCat> @jjcheeker i usually podcast that shit at work
[1:38:18] <%JJCheeker> Yeah I think I'll do that
[1:38:52] <theshillman> is this from conan the barbarian?
[1:39:32] <TheAntitype> I wish I could listen to podcasts and stuff at work. I get too distracted.
[1:40:07] <professorno> I watched 10 episodes of twin peaks, i don't get the hype at all
[1:40:28] <TheAsylumCat> @theantitype it usually helps me focus better, my boss was the one who suggested it
[1:40:29] <%JJCheeker> It's an acquired taste
[1:40:41] <+tokenreefer> tru
[1:41:20] <+DakotaMacDoodle> remember when Nintendo would use Conanmusic for Zelda
[1:41:25] <TheAsylumCat> @jjcheeker it certainly is, wonder if the coffee thing is a metaphor for the show or if I'm reading into it too much
[1:42:13] <%JJCheeker> could be
[1:42:19] <professorno> Would one enjoy it more if they were a fan of David Lynch?
[1:42:30] <%JJCheeker> yes
[1:44:23] <+DakotaMacDoodle> Apparently the last remaining Blockbuster is now an Airbnb in true Blockbuster fashion its timing is terrible.

[1:53:42] <+QueequegTheater> Why use much ink when few word do trick
[1:54:36] <mark1247> @PlagueOfGripes so i guess we won't see star trek stream any time soon since paige new dog correct?
[1:55:13] <Krimxon> Did you watch Picard?
[1:55:23] <Shard_al> Fleet foxes

[1:56:41] <+EpicBigchill> @PlagueOfGripes do you like any other fleet foxes songs? I didn't find any as good as this one when I looked
[1:57:14] <DrkJP520> I recently got started on star trek. starting with the original series
[1:57:31] <%JJCheeker> Their self titled album is really good
[1:57:37] <%JJCheeker> The album this song is on

[2:02:00] <Eidolyss> @PlagueOfGripes may i know what type of digital table are you using?
[2:02:18] <+doc_ock_rokc> Hmmm plague mind if I ask something? I've been thinking of trying to stream my own work but I am A) not nearly as good as people like you and B) nervious as heck) Should I just do it? or is there some wisdom you could bestow?
[2:03:00] <+TaylOctopus91> She's smuggling peaches under that shirt
[2:04:48] <+DakotaMacDoodle> @PlagueOfGripes I don't think the type of tablet really matters but having one with a screen on it sure is convenient
[2:04:57] <JohnClaggart> just doing it will help you get over your fear of sucking
[2:05:00] <ahaegotrigger> well yeah life is important but personal comfort is quite something more
[2:05:17] <JohnClaggart> which is the important part of trying to be an artist
[2:05:23] <TheAsylumCat> @dakotamacdoodle oh yeah it is
[2:05:26] <+SvenHolgersson> I want her wumpas lytOHYES
[2:05:27] <+QueequegTheater> I try not to kill any bugs in my house unless they're active stingers/biters like wasps

[2:06:22] <+QueequegTheater> The best bug spray you can have is having spiders around the outside of your house
[2:06:43] <+DakotaMacDoodle> @JohnClaggart self-loathing
[2:06:55] <TheAsylumCat> @queequegtheater i bombed my house recently because of those, they will actively destroy your shit
[2:06:59] <JohnClaggart> that's third after starving
[2:07:48] <+DakotaMacDoodle> can't forget starving
[2:07:57] <cellularmishap> random bug fact: giant centipedes have toxicognaths, which are the clawed front legs a centipede would use to inject venom as the centipede feasts Cheer10
[2:08:09] <EliahNebb> what was that song?
[2:08:40] <+QueequegTheater> @TheAsylumCat Roaches or spiders?
[2:08:57] <TheAsylumCat> @queequegtheater roaches
[2:09:41] <+QueequegTheater> Yeah, that's what I thought. Fair enough, but it's never been an issue for me. I live in small town Missouri and I don't think I've ever even seen a roach near my house.

[2:52:27] <BrachyZoid> Yeah
[2:52:32] <BrachyZoid> Need more time in the oven
[2:53:45] <TallPixels> Whoever designed Coco did too good of a job. I don't give a shit about Tawna.
[2:53:52] <ChrisM341> How long do you all think it will be until we get some FFVIIR:2 news
[2:54:39] <+doc_ock_rokc> Well even before the lockdown they were hush hush and they probably have to redo some stuff seeing people didn't like the remix aspect so...a year
[2:55:02] <Guvzz> eli angel voice singing to us
[2:55:14] <+arancet> i'd normally say at least 2 years, but they have a habit of talking about shit way too realy, so who knows
[2:55:57] <ChrisM341> That sounds about right, I wonder how much will have to be retconned if so. Worst case scenario we will get the next part towards the end of the upcoming generation of consoles
[2:57:19] <+doc_ock_rokc> Yet for pat it would be a normal sized pistol
[2:57:23] <TallPixels> it's quite reasonable actually I'm a foot tall
[2:58:18] <BrachyZoid> Never enough
[2:58:24] <rdddy> u should do furry porn on patreon, theres a lot of money to make :D
[2:58:40] <Huntercd> He has a lot of money
[2:58:45] <+doc_ock_rokc> before he gets banned because patreon is fucked

[2:58:53] <TallPixels> local man fascinated with long hard things- more at 11
[2:59:32] <+arancet> "thats a sniper rifle, sir"
[2:59:40] <+doc_ock_rokc> We have a selection of rifles right
[2:59:54] <+doc_ock_rokc> we can just slap a pistol grip on there
[2:59:56] <+zsDirtyHarry> What if he was only like 6 inches tall tho
[3:00:04] <TallPixels> you pull the trigger and the bullet just falls out
[3:01:33] <+DakotaMacDoodle> Twist it was pat so the pistol was normal sized
[3:02:04] <%JJCheeker> psaBougie
[3:05:14] <%JJCheeker> I don't know why but I thought Steve Perry was dead

[4:17:46] <%JJCheeker> Welcome
[4:18:03] <%AzureSkyKnight> I can already see the uncomfortable comments to this image. XD
[4:18:07] <MayorRev> i've mainly tuned in to the trek streams on picarto
[4:22:41] <JohnClaggart> this one's fairly tame

[4:33:08] <+blackriceball> @jjcheeker I hear
[4:38:41] <Dao_Puppy> I just got here. Are you helping this girl out of bed from a nap to go volunteer at the animal shelter?
[4:39:38] <+SvenHolgersson> This is looking very fresh Mister of Gripes
[4:43:45] <blackout233692> is this crash bandicoot's sister coco?

[4:45:06] <Glasphemy> Plague lurks in many places
[4:45:26] <Dao_Puppy> Does picarto have an option to lower the resolution yet?
[4:45:41] <@Nightbot> Plague is a youtube animator and also streams at https://picarto.tv/Plague . Also: t-shirts! http://goo.gl/lze8QO
[4:45:43] <laserbeaming> At most, you'll get your VoD muted/deleted
[4:45:55] <mike2hands> is this SAI?
[4:45:55] <laserbeaming> maybe get a warning
[4:46:01] <jaypeesan123> Daym log in just on time for some Metallica
[4:46:06] <MayorRev> yeah it's mute partial bits of your stream
[4:46:19] <MayorRev> whenever it detects copyrighted thing
[4:46:51] <MayorRev> shouldnt be a huge deal on an art stream imo
[4:47:27] <blackout233692> can it detect pron playing in the background. and mute it?
[4:47:29] <jaypeesan123> Metallica has a strong record of not givin fak about copyright or?
[4:47:43] <Mattastiqk> complete opposite
[4:47:53] <Mattastiqk> lars ulrich will sue the shit out of you
[4:47:54] <jaypeesan123> right
[4:47:55] <blackout233692> nah it's lars that's a problem
[4:49:01] <MayorRev> what's his deal

[4:56:07] <GypsySquid> That Coco's cute as hell.

[5:15:26] <chainedwolfstress> Corvids in general are awesome~
[5:16:44] <Samex_Comex> now there is a humming bird
[5:17:45] <terminusterminal> Was there any advice/epiphanies on drawing hands that really helped you out, or was it just long hours of grueling practice?
[5:18:01] <JohnClaggart> hot dogs
[5:18:32] <Pouch_cotato> draw lots of yaoi hands
[5:18:37] <Pouch_cotato> then downsize them
[5:19:24] <Samex_Comex> trace your hand and dress it like a turkey
[5:19:54] <JohnClaggart> what clothes do turkies wear?
[5:20:05] <Pixel_Butts> YOOOOOO its the girl

[5:39:52] <xDartuzax> Reminds me of high school gym class
[5:42:09] <peachteagaming> hewwo
[5:44:08] <mathbertoldo> Is Plague going to leave the VOD up on his channel? I wanted to observe his drawing process, what tools he uses, and so on.
[5:45:39] <+blackriceball> seriously is there a plague playlist?
[5:47:07] <peachteagaming> Plague got big ass brain
[5:47:29] <@Nightbot> @TaylOctopus91 -> Who the heck are you? My evil twin? [stop spamming emotes] [warning]
[5:48:15] <+TaylOctopus91> @nightbot But I only used two thumbs up! :'(
[5:48:42] <Samex_Comex> cranky5Pat
[5:49:15] <chainedwolfstress> cranky5Pat
[5:51:15] <blackout233692> hey plague what new about your setup? looks about the before i went to prison.
[5:51:57] <Samex_Comex> plagueImoya
[5:52:04] <blackout233692> ðŸ‘Œ
[5:54:51] <SirMcSlushy> Odd how im getting sonic character vibes. Must be the eyes. Looks great dou.
[5:55:32] <Samex_Comex> her head is not the orb?
[5:55:41] <%JJCheeker> ðŸ‘‰ ðŸ‘Œ
[5:56:59] <ekremcomics> Does anyone know a good program for print-layout for comics?. I'm having some problems at the moment
[5:57:03] <%JJCheeker> JJCheeker gifted a Tier 1 sub to Samex_Comex! This is their first Gift Sub in the channel! 
[5:57:06] <Omega_Supremus> Heya Plague! marrLove
[5:57:28] <%JJCheeker> I did
[5:58:02] <+silvery_cricket> Hey Plague who is your favorite One Piece character, and who is your least favorite?
[5:58:23] <JohnClaggart> carrot
[5:58:51] <SirMcSlushy> There isn't a whole lot to her, yeah.
[5:59:17] <ArashlTempesta> lytHI
[5:59:29] <xDartuzax> I miss tan Robin :(
[6:00:04] <+silvery_cricket> Sadly tan robin was in fact a fuck up by the animators
[6:00:14] <ArashlTempesta> just need another tropical island
[6:00:25] <ArashlTempesta> was she a fuck up tho? it made sense that she had a tan because of where she was working
[6:00:31] <SirMcSlushy> Not sure who my favorite is. Zoro is cool I guess, Sanji's sthick got old fast.
[6:01:05] <xDartuzax> They kept that mistake for quite a long time though
[6:01:30] <blackout233692> mr.gripes what are your thoughts on the demon souls hd remaster.
[6:01:38] <ArashlTempesta> they played it smartly, because she gets sent to a everlasting winter place where no sun shines it made sense she would lose the tan
[6:01:50] <ArashlTempesta> remember kids use timeskips to fix fuck ups it works!
[6:01:54] <xDartuzax> Honestly Im not a fan of most of the time skip designs for the main crew
[6:02:22] <JohnClaggart> blue something
[6:02:47] <blackout233692> crap. i didn't know that.
[6:02:56] <SirMcSlushy> Im prob not gonna play it unless it ever comes to PC.
[6:03:14] <SirMcSlushy> Ain't worth the price to get a PS5 alongside it in mah opinion, would rather play the original.
[6:03:18] <ArashlTempesta> get the seto kaiba console
[6:03:25] <ArashlTempesta> its stylish!
[6:03:29] <%Samex_Comex> oh thank you for the gift sub @jjcheeker was making food
[6:03:38] <%JJCheeker> No prob
[6:04:01] <%JJCheeker> What you making
[6:04:29] <%Samex_Comex> tomato soup
[6:04:41] <%JJCheeker> ah
[6:05:18] <terminusterminal> Is it really so hard to sit back and get money for being a middle man? Apparently, yes.
[6:05:40] <ArashlTempesta> I would argue it depends on how much each country wants to bitch at you
[6:05:57] <@Nightbot> Plague is a youtube animator and also streams at https://picarto.tv/Plague . Also: t-shirts! http://goo.gl/lze8QO
