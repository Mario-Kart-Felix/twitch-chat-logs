[0:01:45] <%bettysharkface> It's almost 3am.
[0:01:49] <TheWe4pon> morning plagu
[0:01:52] <Good_Snacks> Did you customize your Nobel 6 yet?
[0:01:57] <%bettysharkface> Friday.
[0:02:30] <Good_Snacks> It's the afternoon for Europe
[0:02:35] <%bettysharkface> It's Friday, 2:45am.
[0:03:03] <Good_Snacks> Swampass
[0:03:07] <kevnthekiller> op
[0:03:09] <ne0bunny> 3:45pm her in the UK
[0:03:15] <%bettysharkface> Stinky pants Plague
[0:03:43] <%bettysharkface> Is this a new game or an old game they took sandpaper to?
[0:03:44] <Cyral_Drive> oooooo
[0:03:54] <TheWe4pon> no pants stream?
[0:04:00] <+spacehouse> Halo Reach story: Noble Sacrifice Olympics
[0:04:36] <%bettysharkface> Why are you playing this instead of Disco Elysium?
[0:04:52] <Cyral_Drive> co-op games make it confusing like that sometimes for some reason
[0:04:57] <%bettysharkface> A good game.
[0:05:39] <+spacehouse> instant kill sniper jackals
[0:05:45] <%bettysharkface> NotLikeThis
[0:06:21] <heytakeiteasyterry> finally playing halo reach eh?
[0:06:23] <Zola390> pro tip: the plot sucks, but the gameplay is solid
[0:06:42] <+spacehouse> DO skip all cutscenes
[0:06:51] <%bettysharkface> What is even the point then
[0:07:02] <BlueMoonBlues> Dewrito
[0:07:07] <Cyral_Drive> This is pretty dudebro
[0:07:15] <Vroom0> extremely EPIC
[0:07:19] <Zola390> yeah, gameplay is what made this series.
[0:07:24] <MartiusGW> at least its not destiny
[0:08:11] <%bettysharkface> Halomans shouldn't have faces.
[0:08:26] <dadeaner> we're all gonna die :)
[0:08:42] <dadeaner> Which one is John Halo?
[0:08:56] <%bettysharkface> Haloman vs Doomguy; fight!
[0:09:25] <Cyral_Drive> They didn't fix the audio yet did they
[0:09:35] <MartiusGW> spartans are just discounted space marines
[0:09:51] <+Selectamo> Reach turns into a glass marble
[0:10:19] <madcatr> Thank you for the art and commentary over the years its made life acceptable
[0:10:54] <FirewallStorm> Master Chief might as well be a walking MacGuffin
[0:11:09] <+KaijuUltimax> Weren't the Spartans originally created as advanced riot police? Why would they put all of them on one planet? Why isn't there a bunch still on Earth?
[0:11:36] <+corrosivePaladin> Did you fix the audio setting?
[0:11:47] <madpuppy2424> So apparently these are like bitch Spartans. And there are other stronger not bitch spartans.
[0:11:50] <faykeyfake> why'd they call it peach?
[0:11:50] <locobo98> eyo
[0:11:59] <FirewallStorm> reach is pretty much where the spartans are made
[0:12:10] <Vroom0> The voice for it is great
[0:12:18] <connos_procrastination> PLAAAAAGUE
[0:12:19] <Vroom0> Really jarring and loud
[0:12:27] <connos_procrastination> hello sexy
[0:12:40] <+corrosivePaladin> you have to edit one of the files with notepad++ because they left an audio quality setting off
[0:12:50] <Cyral_Drive> Audio is very poorly mixed
[0:12:52] <+corrosivePaladin> Specifically to fix that
[0:12:53] <locobo98> sounds russian
[0:13:05] <connos_procrastination> crouch can be set to toggle
[0:13:13] <Zebroneath> Might as well create a time paradox
[0:13:49] <connos_procrastination> 343 does it again
[0:14:34] <TheWe4pon> plague of fixes
[0:15:57] <+corrosivePaladin> Should be fine set to 1
[0:16:13] <TheWe4pon> set it to 9
[0:17:24] <seth45er> this one goes to eleven
[0:17:32] <seth45er> ayy
[0:17:36] <@Nightbot> Plague is a youtube animator and also streams at https://picarto.tv/Plague . Also: t-shirts! http://goo.gl/lze8QO
[0:17:44] <JohnSelected> It's Ok, you get mad aim assist with the controller, makes the game easier
[0:18:11] <+spacehouse> in other words, they didnt add anything interesting in solo play
[0:18:15] <connos_procrastination> CUNTER
[0:18:45] <+spacehouse> Subtitles only show up for certain cutscenes
[0:18:49] <connos_procrastination> Marrion cobretti
[0:18:59] <JohnSelected> subtitles are for cutscenes only
[0:19:01] <KityLinn> the sound is not great
[0:19:12] <KityLinn> bugged out several times for me
[0:19:19] <+AMadHollow> hello on this day. you legit got on right as I got off.
[0:19:29] <connos_procrastination> its a juul
[0:19:33] <+spacehouse> *muffled oorah in the distance*
[0:19:52] <+corrosivePaladin> I love how it didnt fix one of them
[0:19:52] <KityLinn> perfect
[0:20:06] <TheWe4pon> what's speech to text?
[0:20:08] <KityLinn> yeah I returned it after an hour of play
[0:20:25] <connos_procrastination> UNSC cant afford turtle beach's
[0:20:27] <%bettysharkface> NotLikeThis
[0:20:43] <zam47> Stop hating! it's an old game
[0:21:00] <%bettysharkface> An old game...
[0:21:04] <KityLinn> when I'd get into combat the effect would get out of sych with what was happening in game
[0:21:07] <connos_procrastination> nah its not
[0:21:07] <JohnSelected> shoot the moa plague
[0:21:12] <JohnSelected> you get an achievement for it
[0:21:16] <zam47> Fucking ostrich's
[0:21:18] <scrublordsamurai> are there subtitles?
[0:21:21] <jellymilkowo> xbox audio
[0:21:23] <connos_procrastination> performances are very wooden
[0:21:32] <KityLinn> like 2001 halo for pc is a better port
[0:21:34] <connos_procrastination> possibly deliberately
[0:21:54] <zam47> CIVILIANS!!! KILL EM
[0:21:58] <zam47> XD
[0:22:02] <+spacehouse> Its the Russo-Muslims, KILL
[0:22:12] <connos_procrastination> they have oil
[0:22:15] <+AMadHollow> ITS THE GRINEER
[0:22:20] <connos_procrastination> some THING
[0:22:38] <+AMadHollow> claim them now
[0:22:45] <zam47> Humanity spread throughout the stars, new languages are bound to pop up
[0:23:00] <connos_procrastination> AA
[0:23:00] <Vroom0> AGH
[0:23:04] <zam47> AGH
[0:23:06] <laserbeaming> AAAH
[0:23:10] <maledictus_faust> leg cramp
[0:23:15] <zam47> Just hanging around
[0:23:54] <scrublordsamurai> gotta use the extra strength nipple clamps!
[0:24:01] <laserbeaming> What kind of thing do you kill in a Halo game?
[0:24:11] <zam47> Umm... aliens?
[0:24:16] <maledictus_faust> foreigners
[0:24:21] <JohnSelected> 'ere we go
[0:24:29] <zam47> Emily??? Do you mean E-meal?
[0:24:32] <connos_procrastination> They all are cos of the supersoldier juice
[0:24:37] <SuperVaderMan> Oh heck, its aliens
[0:24:41] <zam47> Alien commies!!!
[0:24:52] <KityLinn> covenant are shoot on sight
[0:24:59] <zam47> The Covenant and humanity are at war
[0:25:00] <laserbeaming> Show them the power of Hitscan Weapons
[0:25:05] <KityLinn> like russians
[0:25:12] <SuperVaderMan> Yeah, war's on right now, they're known enemies
[0:25:18] <connos_procrastination> but their genitals dont work also becuase of the supersoldier juice
[0:25:23] <scrublordsamurai> in modern halo yeah
[0:25:34] <JohnSelected> it does more AA on precision weapons
[0:25:38] <JohnSelected> try your magnum
[0:25:57] <connos_procrastination> BOXER
[0:26:02] <zam47> There genitals don't work because they had to put on Mjolnir armor, a suit that you literally can never take off
[0:26:17] <KityLinn> you can take it off
[0:26:24] <Magpiejake> the controller option is really aids apparently in this version
[0:26:28] <KityLinn> also they basically don't have working genitals
[0:26:44] <laserbeaming> Does it even explain what "modern" and "classic" do?
[0:27:04] <connos_procrastination> Not allowed to have emotions cos war kill
[0:27:04] <zam47> Remember Reach! "But sir, we're on Reach."
[0:27:22] <TheHylianGuard> What is reach? Baby don't hurt me. Don't hurt me no more
[0:27:22] <xenthic98> modern makes it easier to look diagonally I think
[0:27:37] <zam47> I feel he is new to Halo
[0:27:49] <connos_procrastination> john halo
[0:27:50] <KityLinn> these are just alien scrubs
[0:27:58] <zam47> The Covenant war has been going on for awhile now
[0:28:23] <JohnSelected> if your reticle is slightly out of place is till hits too
[0:28:28] <JohnSelected> its very forgiving
[0:28:31] <TheHylianGuard> Pistol's pretty accurate here, just not as strong as the Halo 1 pistol
[0:28:42] <KityLinn> I think there are windmills like that irl
[0:28:47] <connos_procrastination> ^
[0:29:00] <zam47> Reminds me of that fan that is just a ring
[0:29:09] <+Bearzone> reach happened when I started college....man I'm old now lol
[0:29:21] <KityLinn> vertical windmills or what ever
[0:29:27] <+corrosivePaladin> sprint IS the armor ability
[0:29:29] <TheHylianGuard> Sprint is an armour ability
[0:29:32] <scrublordsamurai> all hail the SPACE POPE!
[0:29:37] <connos_procrastination> squeeze my hog
[0:29:37] <TheHylianGuard> you can swap out sprint for other stuff later
[0:29:39] <JohnSelected> H2 was very jank in all aspects, its a miracle it launched at all
[0:29:47] <Zola390> yeah, you can get rid of sprint for different shit later.
[0:29:58] <zam47> Wort Wort Wort
[0:30:09] <JohnSelected> those are skirmishers plague, beefed up jackals
[0:30:19] <TheHylianGuard> I wonder how far apart they're going to release the rest of the games on PC
[0:30:26] <TheHylianGuard> since they're already on console
[0:30:40] <KityLinn> I think they want to milk it as hard as possible
[0:30:45] <zam47> MCC is here. I doubt they will
[0:30:52] <+KaijuUltimax> It's probably going to be like 2 years between each damn game
[0:31:01] <DemonicHoward> no they cant die
[0:31:10] <JohnSelected> no, they are invincible
[0:31:10] <+InhumanMilitia> plot armor
[0:31:17] <TheHylianGuard> 2 years seems a bit much, I would have thought months apart maybe
[0:31:20] <xenthic98> I think they said they plan on having them all available at the end of 2020, so a halo game every 3 months
[0:31:24] <DemonicHoward> well you are on a farm
[0:31:35] <KityLinn> do a flip!
[0:31:36] <+KaijuUltimax> and of course since they're releasing in chronological order that means that Halo 3 is going to be the last one. So I guess I'll wait for that to come out in like 2026 or whatever
[0:31:41] <mortelkilll> farms would still use hayballs
[0:31:45] <Zebroneath> At least your team is competent
[0:32:06] <TheHylianGuard> @HunterInABox Halo 4 will be the last
[0:32:07] <Quiet__Viking> i prefer the halo 3 elites
[0:32:08] <scrublordsamurai> we'll never escape the jay fever even in space
[0:32:10] <Sozu_> don't think about it
[0:32:13] <mortelkilll> so how do hayballs work?
[0:32:15] <KityLinn> it's space hay
[0:32:16] <NeedlesD> It's space hay
[0:32:17] <+InhumanMilitia> easier to make toys out off
[0:32:19] <zam47> IT'S 2500, DON'T QUESTION IT
[0:32:20] <maledictus_faust> don't you use wire?
[0:32:21] <scrublordsamurai> gotta get the twine
[0:32:25] <TheHylianGuard> You get an achivement for killing the emus
[0:32:27] <KityLinn> toksheLove NeedlesD
[0:32:32] <Sozu_> this isn't earth, that might not be hay Kappa
[0:32:33] <Zola390> they made different classes of Elites. the elites from H1 are there, and there are more powerful ones with more health.
[0:32:36] <The_500lb_Child> They are Chocobos, Ride them
[0:32:42] <+KaijuUltimax> Doesn't change the fact that there's 4 games between Reach and Halo 4 that's going to mean that Halo 3 is going to take half a decade at least before it releases
[0:32:45] <zam47> Emily? It's E-MEAL
[0:32:49] <faykeyfake> eemeww
[0:32:51] <KityLinn> where I live, all the hay bales are just white balls
[0:32:56] <KityLinn> idk why
[0:32:58] <DemonicHoward> plauge can i make a request, to turn on subtitles
[0:33:03] <connos_procrastination> space bales need rope or theyll explode
[0:33:06] <biomegabear> health
[0:33:10] <zam47> @plagueofgripes You are making me cringe with these name pronounciations
[0:33:11] <spread_love> H
[0:33:14] <TheHylianGuard> Because killing animals is fun
[0:33:17] <DemonicHoward> health pack, bottom bar is health top is shield
[0:33:20] <Zola390> That's a health pack.
[0:33:21] <zam47> It's a health kit
[0:33:22] <xenthic98> health pack m8
[0:33:27] <The_500lb_Child> Its a Helicopter landing pad... pretty small one
[0:33:31] <Sozu_> big H stands for hentai
[0:33:41] <mortelkilll> @KityLinn think its a plastic cover to protect them fro mthe elements
[0:33:41] <+KaijuUltimax> Games have had regenerating health so long that Plague no longer recognizes a health kit LUL
[0:34:04] <TheHylianGuard> Ai driving monkaS
[0:34:06] <connos_procrastination> they will
[0:34:07] <+corrosivePaladin> They arent good at driving tho
[0:34:08] <DemonicHoward> never let kate drive
[0:34:08] <zam47> Oh no, AI driving
[0:34:32] <JohnSelected> plague youre playing with fire by letting the AI drive
[0:34:44] <DemonicHoward> the other ai is fine its kate that is the problem
[0:34:48] <The_500lb_Child> Dont worry, there's no cliffs now.
[0:34:55] <+AnonIdiot> Oh christ the a.i. is driving
[0:35:10] <JohnSelected> yeah dont let Kat drive in the next missin, youll get melted by a wraith
[0:35:29] <+AnonIdiot> Or cliff
[0:36:11] <biomegabear> how are you getting really good internet?
[0:37:21] <DemonicHoward> i liked the star trek animated ones
[0:37:23] <spread_love> thats mine too!
[0:37:33] <JohnSelected> oh man that one was really good
[0:37:34] <maledictus_faust> how'd you know?
[0:38:03] <+AnonIdiot> I remember busting my ass to beat this on legendary solo, 3 days later i wanted to strangle everyone
[0:38:31] <JohnSelected> reach on legendary aint that bad, it doesnt have the bullshit some other halos have
[0:38:37] <JohnSelected> mostly the jackal snipers
[0:38:45] <Zola390> in all honesty, yeah, the ai drives just fine.
[0:38:54] <biomegabear> I need to beat reach on legendary some day

[0:39:41] <JohnSelected> time maid sub
[0:40:03] <+AnonIdiot> I did it the first week for the challenge and the cheevo
[0:40:05] <Schuhart> You could tell us we're stupid and make strawman voices of us and we'd still love yu- Wait that'äs already how it is
[0:40:22] <+AnonIdiot> Regret was never stronger
[0:40:37] <JohnSelected> LASO is the real hell
[0:40:54] <+AnonIdiot> Laso is always hell
[0:41:04] <%bettysharkface> Please avoid electrocution.
[0:41:20] <+AnonIdiot> Blackeye is for the true masochist
[0:41:46] <connos_procrastination> i though that was my shit unplugging
[0:41:54] <+Artemis_Scowl> just get back from Finals and plague is streaming?? fantastic day lads
[0:42:03] <DemonicHoward> might need to adjust sensitivity
[0:42:04] <sonofthedeepsouth> kill all the moas
[0:42:16] <sonofthedeepsouth> kill em like you kill coyotes plague
[0:42:39] <biomegabear> zoom varies on weapon
[0:43:01] <+KaijuUltimax> Yes it does
[0:43:02] <+AnonIdiot> Yea
[0:43:08] <biomegabear> yeah its annoying
[0:43:11] <sonofthedeepsouth> melee only plague
[0:43:12] <JohnSelected> yeah, descoping
[0:43:22] <JohnSelected> shame they removed it
[0:43:23] <DemonicHoward> talking to some people controller works just fine even in multiplayer, mainly because of how slow halo is twitch movement isnt as needed
[0:43:24] <+AnonIdiot> Good luck
[0:43:37] <biomegabear> wait, you cant descope?
[0:43:40] <sonofthedeepsouth> the moas are going to go extinct anyway
[0:43:43] <JohnSelected> not in the new halos
[0:43:58] <biomegabear> what a strange design choice
[0:44:07] <+AnonIdiot> Haven't played anything past 4
[0:44:09] <JohnSelected> yeah, made the DMR in 4 super busted
[0:44:17] <DemonicHoward> magnify zoom is for snipers,
[0:44:22] <+AnonIdiot> Refuse to
[0:44:37] <sonofthedeepsouth> halo 4 terminals were a meme
[0:44:40] <hntronium> The hypest gameplay on twitchtube
[0:45:17] <TheHylianGuard> What does your keyboard look like where it makes alt easy to press as the sprint key?
[0:45:21] <ThirdPersonPhil> your vehicles Q,W and E
[0:45:25] <+AnonIdiot> Horn e-break that stuff
[0:45:51] <TheHylianGuard> on my keyboard alt's super awkward to press... or maybe that's just my hands
[0:46:18] <sonofthedeepsouth> plasma>frags
[0:46:33] <DrkJP520> FFXIV is half off to celebrate TGA. Maybe I should get on that shit.
[0:46:40] <+AnonIdiot> Why not use controller?
[0:46:40] <DemonicHoward> cant sprint till halo 4
[0:46:49] <DemonicHoward> health packs
[0:46:53] <TheHylianGuard> they're floppy discs
[0:46:55] <+D00msDayDan> it's even better in mp when everyone's panting together
[0:46:56] <connos_procrastination> my cardio too tbh
[0:46:57] <sonofthedeepsouth> why are they huffing and puffing they are super soldiers
[0:47:04] <TechDragon_Z> Noble Six is out of shape, give him some slack. Lazy super soldier.
[0:47:04] <ThirdPersonPhil> its a tiny hospital
[0:47:09] <sonofthedeepsouth> They shouldn't have problems with cardio
[0:47:17] <TechDragon_Z> Two paths to take, doesn't matter which.
[0:47:37] <sonofthedeepsouth> Moas are the coyotes of reach plague
[0:47:37] <DemonicHoward> he is the sniper
[0:47:37] <TheHylianGuard> @sonofthedeepsouth Probably to indicate how much stamina you have left without having to look at the meter
[0:47:46] <+KaijuUltimax> Isn't that armor like 65 kilos? Even a super soldier probably has trouble with it
[0:48:07] <DemonicHoward> the armor is an exo suit, they should be able to run as fast as a car with no effort
[0:48:10] <hntronium> Isn't it powered armor though?
[0:48:17] <TechDragon_Z> Armor should weigh half a ton or somethin @HunterInABox
[0:48:41] <DemonicHoward> their armor is filled with methan
[0:48:42] <SwagetronPrime> is halo 3 for PC out yet?
[0:48:43] <Schuhart> You shot the little doods gas-bottle
[0:48:49] <Schuhart> So he jeted away
[0:48:51] <TechDragon_Z> Grunts breathe methane, so you shot off their methane tanks
[0:48:53] <+D00msDayDan> it's also power armor so to the spartan wearing it it feels like nothing at all
[0:48:56] <DemonicHoward> yeah they breath methan
[0:49:02] <TheHylianGuard> Murder emu
[0:49:09] <+AnonIdiot> Its armor is gas powerd
[0:49:17] <+DesmondtheOrc> oh hey finally caught you streaming
[0:49:20] <+kyh9> You're supposed to laugh when the alien dies
[0:49:26] <+AnonIdiot> Grunt birthday is a thing
[0:49:27] <biomegabear> yes
[0:49:40] <+kyh9> It hit shields
[0:49:40] <biomegabear> in older games they dont have them on
[0:49:46] <+KaijuUltimax> Grunt's breathe methane so they have methane tanks you can shoot off for funnies
[0:49:53] <TechDragon_Z> Nah you busted his shields with it.
[0:50:00] <DemonicHoward> always hilarious, untill your in a small room and they come rocketing at you and kill you with impact damage
[0:50:04] <+spacehouse> grenades are bad in Halo as a tradition
[0:50:06] <+DesmondtheOrc> Before they got redesigned they had the methane tanks in their little hood things
[0:50:12] <hntronium> Are there subtitles?
[0:50:19] <KityLinn> "we don't leave people behind" o.o
[0:50:23] <+AnonIdiot> Should be
[0:50:23] <+D00msDayDan> "i'm seeing possible friendly forces under attack" "we're under attack"
[0:50:24] <KityLinn> zzzzz
[0:50:30] <hntronium> rip
[0:50:36] <+Javaa01> There are very limited subtitles, because 2009
[0:51:31] <+AnonIdiot> Kate's ass still a thing? I remember seeing nothing but screenshots of that years ago
[0:51:36] <KityLinn> return it and pick it up again in 6 months to a year
[0:51:38] <hntronium> When I see that name I pronounce it as George
[0:51:46] <+D00msDayDan> you turn by looking
[0:51:48] <ThirdPersonPhil> you control with the looking
[0:51:49] <Schuhart> You steer with the mouse
[0:51:51] <+kyh9> Hahahahhahahahhahahahahahahahahhahahahahahhaha...this takes me back
[0:51:51] <TheHylianGuard> you're meant to use the mouse to drive
[0:51:53] <+DesmondtheOrc> it's mouselook steering
[0:51:54] <KityLinn> lol
[0:51:54] <Zola390> turn by looking.
[0:51:55] <TechDragon_Z> Steer by looking
[0:51:57] <+Javaa01> You turn with the mouse
[0:51:58] <+AnonIdiot> Pppfff noob
[0:52:00] <+kyh9> Turn in the direction you want to steer
[0:52:03] <xenthic98> Lmfao
[0:52:06] <mexicansunglasses> The excitement for Halo baffles me. If you play FPS on PC why would you play something as slow as a walking simulator?
[0:52:13] <+spacehouse> Console Game
[0:52:13] <bob_dog> lmao
[0:52:13] <ThirdPersonPhil> its different but its not actually bad
[0:52:14] <KityLinn> it's howq they did it
[0:52:15] <Schuhart> Cause you steer with the sight stick on the console
[0:52:17] <DemonicHoward> because this game wasnt made with keyboard support
[0:52:21] <+kyh9> In the original, you would just look at the direction you want to go
[0:52:22] <TechDragon_Z> Halo controls have always been like that. I'm so used to it I don't even think about it
[0:52:26] <+OranHexthief> up and down are forward and back is to mimic that driving in halo is twin stick on controller plague
[0:52:26] <ThirdPersonPhil> it gives you analog control on the PC
[0:52:29] <+kyh9> Controller-priority
[0:52:34] <heartlessclown2> It's been like that even in the older games
[0:52:47] <SuperVaderMan> It's just a console thing
[0:52:51] <xenthic98> Driving been the same since 2001
[0:52:51] <hntronium> tbh I feel mouse steering isn't that bad
[0:52:53] <KityLinn> yeah it was like that in the original 2001 release
[0:52:57] <TheHylianGuard> It's because you drive with the camera on controller too
[0:53:05] <+kyh9> Spartan training
[0:53:18] <+kyh9> Did you play the older Halo games?
[0:53:22] <+kyh9> Just curious
[0:53:25] <biomegabear> Who would you go to in making PC controler for a console game?
[0:53:45] <+TheShisno> See that mountain? You can climb it
[0:54:06] <+DesmondtheOrc> I can't remember are Halo Space Marines heavier than 40k Space Marines?
[0:54:16] <hntronium> Lighter
[0:54:29] <+D00msDayDan> your tires aren't touching the floor, you're definitely not meant to be on that bridge
[0:54:30] <Dakuu75> the 40k guys are pretty thicc
[0:54:36] <xenthic98> Is he out of map? looks like somewhere you wouldn't be allowed
[0:54:37] <ThirdPersonPhil> i dont get why people are claiming is because of controllers the left analog on the controller X axis is just thrown away
[0:54:41] <KityLinn> lol
[0:54:48] <+TheShisno> Current gen MJOLNIR armor is only like 100 lbs of titanium plus the user's weight so it's usually 300+, definitely lighter
[0:54:48] <KityLinn> just keep on truckin
[0:54:50] <+DesmondtheOrc> Their neck is like a foot in diameter if i remember correctly
[0:54:51] <TechDragon_Z> You seemed to have encountered an error with your vehicle.
[0:54:52] <hntronium> You have failed the truck
[0:54:57] <Dakuu75> truck-chan!
[0:54:59] <SuperVaderMan> Goodbye truck
[0:55:00] <+AnonIdiot> You need a horse
[0:55:12] <Paralurx> Someone finally defeated truck-kun. He'll never isekai another teenager again
[0:55:13] <+Javaa01> This isn't Halo 2, so there aren't as many Out Of Bounds funsies here
[0:55:24] <+DesmondtheOrc> Man Halo 2 was a lot of fun
[0:55:33] <+DesmondtheOrc> The fucking Scarab Gun was a journey
[0:55:36] <+AnonIdiot> Horse can climb mountains easy, like in oblivion
[0:55:53] <+TheShisno> So we have George, Whore Hay, and Geor Gay
[0:56:03] <$Jathspuh> Crouch jump works
[0:56:05] <hntronium> Jour Gay
[0:56:11] <mistermastergreg> the dropship pilot just found out about the furry porn, that's why
[0:56:15] <+AnonIdiot> Poor George's name
[0:56:18] <ThirdPersonPhil> its his family crest
[0:56:32] <Schuhart> Like Vaders helmet
[0:56:35] <$Jathspuh> mash crouch while jumping to get a little extra height
[0:56:36] <KityLinn> his suit is like slapped together
[0:56:40] <KityLinn> they mention it later
[0:56:46] <+DesmondtheOrc> Come on Plague, 40k is where you go if you want pauldrons so big they lose peripheral vision
[0:56:53] <DrkJP520> It looks like Jorr hay is wearing a life vest
[0:56:57] <+TheShisno> Even Halsey, the woman who basically abducted him, is just like "fuck did you do to my armor?"
[0:57:01] <+AnonIdiot> Armor customization used to be a thing
[0:57:09] <KityLinn> exactly shisno
[0:57:10] <xenthic98> DMR not battle rifle
[0:57:18] <+AnonIdiot> Lol
[0:57:20] <hntronium> Designated Marksman Rifle
[0:57:24] <+KaijuUltimax> This is that game where it's top of PVP
[0:57:27] <+AnonIdiot> Dmr top tier
[0:57:28] <+TheShisno> Halo 2 battle rifle was the only realistic choice
[0:57:28] <+D00msDayDan> hold tab for weapon descriptions
[0:57:29] <@Nightbot> Plague is a youtube animator and also streams at https://picarto.tv/Plague . Also: t-shirts! http://goo.gl/lze8QO
[0:57:30] <ThirdPersonPhil> armor customization is not a thing anymore?
[0:57:35] <DrkJP520> throat chop
[0:57:37] <DemonicHoward> it is
[0:57:38] <TechDragon_Z> Self defense
[0:57:41] <KityLinn> he came at you with a knife
[0:57:41] <+DesmondtheOrc> Even outside of monster hunter you can't stop murdering animals
[0:57:42] <biomegabear> still there
[0:57:44] <$Jathspuh> D:
[0:57:46] <AbysmalWulf> Space Peta! D:
[0:58:02] <approachingdeath> He’s coming right for us
[0:58:10] <hntronium> Remember Kids
[0:58:10] <+AnonIdiot> Halo mcc is set, no real customization
[0:58:11] <biomegabear> The spirit dropped enemies
[0:58:12] <KityLinn> if you want fun in war become a PMC
[0:58:13] <+TheShisno> What difficulty are we on
[0:58:22] <hntronium> War is fun -Plague of Gripes, probably
[0:58:25] <KityLinn> you can just get drunk all day and get paid
[0:58:41] <+TheShisno> And yeah in the grand tradition of 343 ruining older games, the sound is super wimpy
[0:58:48] <TechDragon_Z> Armor = health and rank.
[0:58:50] <+DesmondtheOrc> friendly reminder that as part of the Spartan training, small children were abducted and told to watch videos of wolves hunting and the battle of Thermopylae, because those things are super related to military warfare
[0:59:06] <DemonicHoward> this game is a bit more variety, both armor and color can be used to determing how strong they are
[0:59:14] <biomegabear> @DesmondtheOrc are those from the book?
[0:59:24] <+DesmondtheOrc> @biomegabear yeah from Fall of Reach I think
[0:59:26] <Dakuu75> lol
[0:59:29] <$Jathspuh> LUL
[0:59:29] <+TheShisno> Pog
[0:59:41] <KityLinn> the chicken population will never recover
[0:59:46] <+TheShisno> LUL
[0:59:46] <+DesmondtheOrc> nailed it
[0:59:53] <+DesmondtheOrc> superior military training
[1:00:00] <hntronium> Its tilted
[1:00:00] <TechDragon_Z> Do not question the pilots methods
[1:00:00] <SuperVaderMan> Good enough parking job LUL
[1:00:04] <KityLinn> ready for war
[1:00:07] <Dakuu75> wooooooow
[1:00:16] <+DesmondtheOrc> he's done with you making fun of him
[1:00:23] <+TheShisno> If a Spartan hit a Flacon propeller, the blades would explode and the armor would need a new coat of paint
[1:00:58] <DemonicHoward> also remember that the spartan 3s where orphans where were so hopped up on drugs that their bodies underwent massive devlopment so they looked 20 at 12, and at 16 were sent on suicide missions in which only 3 out of 1000 of them would live
[1:00:59] <theamazingroberto> plague playing halo? i feel like i'm taking crazy pills
[1:01:03] <hntronium> Perfect
[1:01:05] <stranger59> I just got here.... he winning?
[1:01:06] <+DesmondtheOrc> That filter makes it almost unintelligible
[1:01:16] <TheHylianGuard> She's using an xbox 360 mic
[1:01:22] <+D00msDayDan> hey noble 6 can i get a fuckin uhhh
[1:01:31] <xenthic98> Lol Emile
[1:01:34] <+KaijuUltimax> Did she the total was $12.80? But I barely ordered anything
[1:01:37] <$Jathspuh> LUL
[1:01:54] <TechDragon_Z> The port is having all kinds of problems
[1:01:58] <approachingdeath> Mmmbbtth, pay at second window
[1:02:03] <+DesmondtheOrc> No, in Halo 2 the mics were actually BETTER
[1:02:04] <stranger59> Time more than money, I think.
[1:02:07] <Dakuu75> the only thing I remember about Reach is the egoraptor animation, I swear.
[1:02:11] <+DesmondtheOrc> shit in Halo 1 the mics were better
[1:02:13] <+D00msDayDan> mcc reach has audio problems
[1:02:16] <TheHylianGuard> did you change the audio quality setting in the config files?
[1:02:30] <TheHylianGuard> someone found that the quality by default is set to the lowest
[1:02:44] <+DesmondtheOrc> It seems like everyone has the meme-y bass boost over their voice
[1:02:46] <TheWe4pon> he did
[1:02:53] <+AnonIdiot> Here comes 2
[1:02:59] <+Javaa01> The audio mixing is jacked in this port, so that's why it sound kinda bad
[1:03:04] <DrkJP520> Plague, there's a war going on
[1:03:04] <stranger59> So they don't fall on Worf
[1:03:15] <+TheShisno> Yeah 343 screwed up the sound
[1:03:15] <TheHylianGuard> yeah, the audio mixing problems were listed in the dev blog before launch
[1:03:25] <TheHylianGuard> so they already know about the issues at least
[1:03:28] <Dakuu75> no one packs things like that. you don't make a pallet sandwich because pallets are heavy as fuck
[1:03:31] <$Jathspuh> I think they took that out
[1:03:35] <+TheShisno> If a gun has a battery (i.e. plasma) the one you pick up has higher ammo
[1:03:43] <KityLinn> perfect
[1:03:52] <TechDragon_Z> Melee lunge is shorter in this I think
[1:04:07] <ThirdPersonPhil> melee no longer suck?
[1:04:24] <+DesmondtheOrc> oh that's right they added takedown animations
[1:04:27] <stranger59> SNEAK KILL
[1:04:32] <+TheShisno> Higher rank is red
[1:04:33] <KityLinn> it's fine he says
[1:04:40] <+AnonIdiot> Yeah, because thing
[1:04:49] <arivalappears> It was just to look cool in MP
[1:04:52] <TechDragon_Z> Drive the forklift
[1:04:53] <stranger59> I think Jackals have ranks... or are just told they have ranks.
[1:04:58] <zamzoph> what difficulty is Plague playing on?
[1:04:59] <SuperVaderMan> I'm glad you can also neck-snap aliens. It'd be funny though if you like twisted his head and he was like "???" and he didn't have vertebrae to snap or whatever
[1:05:02] <+Javaa01> There's stealth in one mission
[1:05:02] <TheHylianGuard> I think you might have been the first person to ever complain about the pallets in this game
[1:05:12] <TechDragon_Z> You can drive the forklift
[1:05:26] <KityLinn> they're basically slaves
[1:05:31] <+TheShisno> FORKLIFT
[1:05:33] <DemonicHoward> you can drive the forklift
[1:05:36] <TheHylianGuard> take the forklift for a spin
[1:05:36] <stranger59> FORKLIFT
[1:05:38] <hntronium> It is in the future
[1:05:40] <+D00msDayDan> get in the forklift it's super good
[1:05:40] <Dakuu75> that is a space-forklift
[1:05:42] <ThirdPersonPhil> what is the deal with spartan's height? a friend once told me they are hude and showed me a screen of some cinematics of the more recent games where there is a tiny human by the side of one
[1:05:46] <TechDragon_Z> Forklift to victory
[1:05:56] <hntronium> Are you having the fun Mister John Halo?
[1:06:11] <stranger59> 500 years of forklift advancement
[1:06:14] <ThirdPersonPhil> but i played the first halo and i remember master chief been around the same size as the marines
[1:06:15] <DemonicHoward> other building
[1:06:22] <+TheShisno> It's frontloaded to skewer the enemies of humanity
[1:06:22] <+DesmondtheOrc> I mean wasn't it kinda confirmed in Halo 2 that the covenant used the human names for their troops? so these guys are literally raised to be cannon fodder
[1:06:33] <+AnonIdiot> Augments and gene splicing makes them taller
[1:06:38] <ThirdPersonPhil> also all the props in the games does not sell that liek those water jugs are the size of the character
[1:06:40] <biomegabear> Plauge how much help do you want from chat?
[1:06:41] <SuperVaderMan> @ThirdPersonPhil The big ones are trained and physically enhanced from a young age. Later spartans aren't as big because they're just dudes in armor
[1:06:50] <TechDragon_Z> Reach introduce a few new weapons. New at the time.
[1:06:57] <+DesmondtheOrc> you have to hit the reload key
[1:07:00] <+DesmondtheOrc> it's weird
[1:07:13] <htt0r1hnz0> Needler!
[1:07:14] <KityLinn> it got a manual cooling system
[1:07:17] <+AnonIdiot> Plasma doesn't reload
[1:07:33] <NSFW_Nurgle> Are you enjoying this game, Plague?
[1:07:38] <KityLinn> you're not doing what you're supposed to
[1:07:38] <TechDragon_Z> Drive the forklift inside
[1:07:40] <ThirdPersonPhil> @SuperVaderMan but did the size of master chief changed during the games? cause he was not that tall at all
[1:07:42] <KityLinn> there you go
[1:07:42] <biomegabear> This is level is an hour and a half on legendary
[1:07:44] <DemonicHoward> also enemies get stronger with more players
[1:07:46] <KityLinn> ooh no
[1:07:50] <stranger59> @DesmondtheOrc I think when the Covenant are translated to English, their names for their races are also translated. But grunt is still a fitting name.
[1:07:50] <AbysmalWulf> 4 and 5 LUL
[1:07:51] <+TheShisno> Whoops
[1:07:51] <biomegabear> THe stagnation was after this
[1:07:53] <KityLinn> go inside
[1:07:55] <xenthic98> go inside the building
[1:07:56] <+AnonIdiot> You have no fucking clue
[1:07:56] <+AntithesisEK> it stagnated about 1.6 months before halo 4.
[1:08:19] <+AntithesisEK> all down hill from there!
[1:08:20] <Dakuu75> does this have online co-op?
[1:08:22] <SuperVaderMan> @ThirdPersonPhil Yeah that wasn't a thing in 1 and maybe 2, it's lore that was adopted later
[1:08:31] <+TheShisno> Halo 5 we don't talk about
[1:08:35] <$Jathspuh> Yeah. 4 player Dakuu
[1:08:39] <Lord_Siking> Halo 1 was so simple, it was really the gameplay that was good the story was just action sci fi with cool hero. Im surprised how much they squeezed out of it
[1:08:50] <KityLinn> I liked the story and characters of 4
[1:08:50] <TechDragon_Z> Lot of people would agree the main games peaked around Reach/3
[1:08:55] <+TheShisno> H
[1:08:55] <htt0r1hnz0> HEROIN
[1:08:56] <ThirdPersonPhil> weird retcon that one
[1:08:57] <xenthic98> you can only change so much + you'll piss off the community in some way
[1:09:00] <+AnonIdiot> The studio split around now i think
[1:09:05] <stranger59> I didn't mind 4... 5 bored me to tears though.
[1:09:10] <+AnonIdiot> This is 343
[1:09:14] <+TheShisno> You deepthroated the heroin box
[1:09:28] <+DesmondtheOrc> just caress that dead man
[1:09:52] <DrkJP520> She's got a mouth on her
[1:09:53] <+TheShisno> 4 was still good, had neat concepts. 5 we don't talk about
[1:09:56] <+AnonIdiot> The old studio went leashed to ea
[1:10:01] <SpicyBC> Reach was one of the last halo games I played. Didn't have any interest after this one for whatever reason
[1:10:02] <Dakuu75> thanks for the warning bitch!
[1:10:14] <Lord_Siking> the dialogue in this game is surprisingly awful
[1:10:15] <AbysmalWulf> Yes.
[1:10:19] <+Battshadows> absolutely
[1:10:20] <hntronium> I didn't know elites were predators
[1:10:21] <+TheShisno> Yes
[1:10:25] <biomegabear> people ether like or dont like reach in terms of multiplaer
[1:10:25] <+AnonIdiot> Yep
[1:10:27] <+KaijuUltimax> I'm one of the few that did not like Reach, Halo ended at 3, fuck you, fight me
[1:10:28] <+AntithesisEK> it's - relatively - a good one
[1:10:28] <Zola390> Unquestioningly.
[1:10:30] <ThirdPersonPhil> which is worse: bad guy or charlie?
[1:10:34] <+DesmondtheOrc> Trust me, halo 4 gets worse in both story and gameplay
[1:10:36] <SpicyBC> I liked the story in ODST a bit more
[1:10:36] <+Battshadows> last bungie halo, only fitting that it's the last ok one
[1:10:37] <stranger59> They should put more wrestling moves in Halo.
[1:10:45] <Tennochief> it gets better
[1:10:46] <Tiny_Axolotl> hi
[1:10:50] <+D00msDayDan> now to figure out the night vision button
[1:11:01] <biomegabear> what about ODST where you just play as humna
[1:11:03] <+Battshadows> 4 if this is pc
[1:11:04] <TheHylianGuard> "Are you sure this was the last halo?" Asks man who despises Halo
[1:11:05] <+TheShisno> You're just not a Halo guy I guess
[1:11:09] <TheHylianGuard> last good halo*
[1:11:14] <Lord_Siking> I like the gameplay, just hate the story
[1:11:19] <SuperVaderMan> Yeah if you didn't like 2 then anything after isn't going to impress
[1:11:31] <+DesmondtheOrc> Halo was a part of my childhood so I'll happily admit i'm biased
[1:11:35] <+AntithesisEK> this isn't my tigris prime
[1:11:36] <Tennochief> Halo has no default zoom
[1:11:39] <xenthic98> Same
[1:11:40] <+KaijuUltimax> The events of Reach are MUCH more interesting in the novels than the games
[1:11:44] <Tennochief> switch to your pistol
[1:11:49] <+TheShisno> If you don't like 2, you may as well quit before you grow to despise it
[1:11:49] <+D00msDayDan> the assault rifle is bad, that's normal for halo
[1:11:55] <biomegabear> damage does change
[1:11:58] <stranger59> Gotta have dat buttrock
[1:12:04] <Tennochief> switch to pistol if you want zoom
[1:12:08] <+AnonIdiot> Haven't felt the need to play warframe for awhile
[1:12:10] <+AntithesisEK> plasma pistol
[1:12:22] <+DesmondtheOrc> There's two things about Legendary you have to remember: 1. Grenades 2. Jackal Snipers
[1:12:22] <+TheShisno> The AR is awful in this because of bloom, almost like you're supposed to burst fire but they didn't do anything special with that
[1:12:24] <Lord_Siking> grenades are kinda bad in reach, plasma pistol and something did it for me
[1:12:44] <+AnonIdiot> Its at the point where the grind outweighs the game
[1:13:17] <TechDragon_Z> Drops a bubble shield that will heal you, shield can break though
[1:13:23] <Lord_Siking> shotgun is pathetic in this game, on legendary it hardly kills grunts
[1:13:31] <ThirdPersonPhil> turn on night vision bruh
[1:13:33] <biomegabear> halo 1 did that alot
[1:13:40] <stranger59> Niiiice
[1:13:42] <+KaijuUltimax> In the first Halo they didn't drop the swords
[1:13:42] <SpicyBC> Gotta admit, they weren't all that creative with abilities. Seriously who makes sprinting a special ability?
[1:13:46] <+DesmondtheOrc> Energy sword wasn't a thing in Halo 1, and Halo 2 had a way too strong lunge so it got over-nerfed
[1:13:51] <hntronium> Its a melee weapon
[1:13:57] <+TheShisno> Drop shield is just an immobile bubble that takes some damage before popping and any person and vehicle can go through it, and it heals health if you're inside it
[1:13:59] <stranger59> In 1 you couldn't get it.
[1:14:08] <+KaijuUltimax> Halo 3 swordfighting was the best shit though
[1:14:21] <+AntithesisEK> it was likely an attempt at balancing it was just a bit of a failed experiment since sprint and jetpack totally eclipse other things @SpicyBC
[1:14:31] <+AnonIdiot> Halo2 swordskating
[1:14:51] <biomegabear> warthog can now explode
[1:14:57] <+DesmondtheOrc> Did she really just pronounce colonel the way it's spelled?
[1:15:06] <alrobot2014> yes she did
[1:15:11] <ThirdPersonPhil> ew... he has a face
[1:15:17] <htt0r1hnz0> Wait. Is 6 the only one with night vision?
[1:15:20] <kiwicoffin> horhey
[1:15:23] <+DesmondtheOrc> @alrobot2014 thanks, I hate it.
[1:15:29] <+KaijuUltimax> Earth has hundreds of languages and Jorge just so happens to know Hungarian? Yeah right, fuck off
[1:15:30] <+AnonIdiot> Swords in reach were awful, they get blocked with shoulder
[1:15:40] <biomegabear> on emile?
[1:15:42] <ThatOneGuyYouSaw> ARE YOU READY?
[1:15:45] <SpicyBC> rule of cool though
[1:15:46] <+TheShisno> Well it's an EVA helmet
[1:15:53] <+askalta> emile sounds like a girls name and he really tried to compensate for it
[1:16:07] <TechDragon_Z> He carved a skull into his faceplate. How the fuck does he see.
[1:16:08] <duathadruid> The hungarians were those to achieve true dominance over the peoples of man.
[1:16:12] <Dakuu75> why is the comander taking his helmet off? now?
[1:16:12] <Tiny_Axolotl> dat ass?
[1:16:18] <+TheShisno> Reach is a Hungarian settled planet, and Jorge is Reach native
[1:16:21] <ThatOneGuyYouSaw> steroids makes you good at speaking other languages
[1:16:22] <SuperVaderMan> Yeah, Covenant war is on already
[1:16:29] <TechDragon_Z> This is only a few months before Halo One
[1:16:31] <DemonicHoward> this war is 40 years old at this point
[1:16:32] <duathadruid> Thats a...REACH! haha im so funny
[1:16:35] <biomegabear> when does this take place?
[1:16:36] <JonKhan> They even know how zealots work
[1:16:51] <stranger59> Yeah, the war had been going on a while. The first encounter was on Harvest.
[1:16:54] <piggypig> this game ends 5 minutes before halo 1
[1:16:58] <MoonKing> Prophets found out humans were the real inheritors of the Forerunners and got butthurt
[1:17:03] <+DesmondtheOrc> This whole "Spartans aren't humans anymore" thing doesn't really work in Halo because they totally are, it works in Warhammer because Space Marines are genetically enhanced, given extra organs, and hypno-indoctrinated to the point that they actually aren't human anymore
[1:17:03] <+AntithesisEK> the SPEEDMOON is here
[1:17:12] <duathadruid> yes
[1:17:15] <SpicyBC> almost exactly rogue one
[1:17:16] <SuperVaderMan> Surprisingly accurate
[1:17:17] <BlueMoonBlues> pretty much
[1:17:20] <+TheShisno> Yeah it's Rogue One
[1:17:21] <Zebroneath> yes
[1:17:21] <piggypig> rogue halo
[1:17:24] <+D00msDayDan> the last shot of this game is the first shot of halo 1
[1:17:37] <+TheShisno> Cortana is basically the Death Star plans
[1:17:38] <@Nightbot> Plague is a youtube animator and also streams at https://picarto.tv/Plague . Also: t-shirts! http://goo.gl/lze8QO
[1:17:39] <stranger59> Yes, Rogue One was based on Halo Reach.
[1:17:44] <poisin224> that's a good analogy, also in that it's better as a standalone than the last few in the main series
[1:17:48] <piggypig> plague you can change your halo's colors
[1:17:50] <duathadruid> Does that mean rogue one was ripping off Halo: Reach?
[1:17:58] <biomegabear> was halo story ever good?
[1:18:03] <donkeykingkongskock> Is this your first time playing this game ??
[1:18:06] <SpicyBC> she is
[1:18:06] <JonKhan> The story takes itself too serious
[1:18:09] <DemonicHoward> yes
[1:18:09] <AbysmalWulf> Prosthetic
[1:18:11] <Yans_xc4> aye
[1:18:14] <+TheShisno> It's workable, fills in gaps if you never read the books (which you should)
[1:18:18] <$Jathspuh> Yeah
[1:18:18] <connos_procrastination> yeah its hot
[1:18:23] <+TheShisno> Thikk
[1:18:25] <stranger59> Yes, she has a robo-arm
[1:18:27] <SpicyBC> It got blown off on the mission that got the last Noble Six killed
[1:18:27] <+zxyoloswag420blazeitxxz> what a dumper
[1:18:37] <DemonicHoward> go kill those slaves plague
[1:18:38] <+KaijuUltimax> Reach novels are better for the story than the game
[1:18:43] <htt0r1hnz0> The LITERAL SLAVES. Yes shoot them.
[1:18:44] <+AnonIdiot> Kate's ass is a meme still?
[1:18:44] <stranger59> Spartan butts in Reach were amazing.
[1:18:46] <SuperVaderMan> They deliberately made the aliens serious in this game, no fun allowed
[1:18:48] <duathadruid> They dont make funny noises because this is a srs game for srs people like rogue one
[1:18:49] <TechDragon_Z> They took out most of the humor to focus more on the military aspect
[1:18:52] <Dakuu75> oh, do the kids spell "thicc" with two K's instead of two C's these days?
[1:18:52] <xenthic98> They run around when you kill their elite
[1:18:56] <+DesmondtheOrc> Murder those slaves and animals with guns
[1:18:58] <donkeykingkongskock> Reach novel isn’t the same story
[1:19:04] <+TheShisno> the Fall of Reach novel is great, and just a good book perioid
[1:19:09] <MoonKing> Halo is strikingly similar to Star Wars in that secondary material is leagues better than main material
[1:19:17] <+TheShisno> Man if you want iron sights, play Halo 5 LUL
[1:19:25] <connos_procrastination> irons are for wimps
[1:19:29] <+KaijuUltimax> reading Fall of Reach and Ghosts of Reach is infinitely better for story
[1:19:33] <Mizaiya> I always thought of halo as unreal tournament lite
[1:19:41] <connos_procrastination> real tough guys shoot without looking
[1:19:48] <SpicyBC> "Silently kill an enemy from behind" yeah great advice in the middle of a firefight game
[1:19:52] <Zebroneath> Halo 5 introduced iron sights for all weapons
[1:19:52] <+AnonIdiot> Blarg blarg blarg
[1:20:04] <ThatOneGuyYouSaw> that and snipers
[1:20:05] <DemonicHoward> brutes are also strong
[1:20:06] <stranger59> Get that big dumb covenant gun!
[1:20:07] <Dakuu75> real-real tough guys throw the bullets and don't need a gun
[1:20:28] <duathadruid> Halo PvP is basically unreal tournament but with a pace closer to R6 siege than mainlining cocaine
[1:20:43] <JonKhan> Remember when the grunts spoke English and referred to you as "The Demon"
[1:20:48] <+DesmondtheOrc> dual smgs in halo 2 made tearing down elite shields way easier
[1:21:01] <SuperVaderMan> The Plasma Pistol + headshot combo is still a thing in this game
[1:21:02] <htt0r1hnz0> Sticky nades too
[1:21:03] <Fraudbear> does this mean plague is going to draw fuckable Elites?
[1:21:13] <stranger59> Oh yeah, some high up Elites on Legendary are complete bull.
[1:21:13] <duathadruid> god i hope so
[1:21:14] <+TheShisno> Reach elites kill you in one kick to the sternum on Legendary, it's sad that Legendary is just play like a coward difficulty
[1:21:15] <biomegabear> @SuperVaderMan yes unless its LASO
[1:21:30] <+AnonIdiot> Rule34 already went there dude
[1:21:35] <Dakuu75> @Fraudbear I hope not... I don't know if the world is ready
[1:21:38] <+DesmondtheOrc> Remember that one Halo movie that had a short about an Elite and it played out like a samurai movie, complete with blood geysers pouring out of people's necks?
[1:21:47] <Fraudbear> Heroic is fun tho
[1:21:57] <DemonicHoward> the abilties reset each mission
[1:21:59] <biomegabear> NO ITS DIFFERENT
[1:21:59] <duathadruid> its not the pistol
[1:22:00] <DemonicHoward> that is not a pistol
[1:22:01] <+TheShisno> JUST THE PISTOL LUL
[1:22:02] <duathadruid> get the ordnance
[1:22:05] <duathadruid> oh god please
[1:22:10] <+DesmondtheOrc> no plague it's the hammer of dawn
[1:22:11] <$Jathspuh> lol
[1:22:12] <stranger59> It's a Hammer of Dawn.
[1:22:17] <+DesmondtheOrc> it's big satellite strike
[1:22:18] <+AnonIdiot> Laser pointer get it
[1:22:18] <SuperVaderMan> It's for if you get grenaded
[1:22:19] <ClaymoreJesus> he doesn't know LUL
[1:22:20] <htt0r1hnz0> Dude. Ordinance gonna need it
[1:22:22] <+KaijuUltimax> Remember the Halo short where a spartan gets fucked up by a T-Rex and made fun of by Master Chief? I do
[1:22:24] <duathadruid> the pistol thing is a hammer of dawn
[1:22:26] <Fraudbear> Fucking get it
[1:22:26] <SpicyBC> yeah
[1:22:27] <AbysmalWulf> Yes
[1:22:28] <SuperVaderMan> Yes
[1:22:28] <DemonicHoward> yes
[1:22:30] <ThirdPersonPhil> game is balanced for PVP plague
[1:22:32] <+AnonIdiot> Orbital strike
[1:22:33] <+D00msDayDan> hold the scoreboard button for descriptions
[1:22:36] <SuperVaderMan> Correct
[1:22:37] <Schuhart> Armerlock armerlock armerlock armerlock
[1:22:37] <Fraudbear> Its not the Pistol
[1:22:38] <stranger59> Yes, now grab your Hammer of Dawn.
[1:22:43] <Zola390> Plague, you are an old man.
[1:22:44] <biomegabear> the burst takes out shields
[1:22:45] <DemonicHoward> gernade, being surounded, or vehicals trying to ram you
[1:22:48] <+DesmondtheOrc> get the laser pointer'
[1:22:50] <Cyral_Drive> tab for description
[1:22:52] <+TheShisno> ok boomer
[1:22:58] <TechDragon_Z> If a vehicle trys to ram you can destroy the vehicle with it
[1:22:58] <SpicyBC> The absolute best thing about that armor lock is when you used it if someone tried to run you over in a ghost or wraith
[1:22:59] <htt0r1hnz0> I wanna see if you can even advance without it lol
[1:23:03] <SpicyBC> and they just blow up
[1:23:04] <AbysmalWulf> It stops grenades, projectiles and kills some vehicles if they run into you.
[1:23:05] <stranger59> Well, enjoy ALL the PVP maps being from the campaign!
[1:23:09] <+AnonIdiot> It was rediculous in the first year
[1:23:12] <+DesmondtheOrc> lol
[1:23:15] <+TheShisno> Yeah no shit
[1:23:18] <approachingdeath> Works for story fine
[1:23:19] <duathadruid> Armor lock is actually useful in PvE when you just wanna let enemy vehicles boost into you and THEY die instead
[1:23:20] <ClaymoreJesus> yeah, sure it's a "pistol" LUL
[1:23:20] <kiwicoffin> It used to be broken. Your camera could snap to position and attack immediately
[1:23:22] <+DesmondtheOrc> you sure showed us
[1:23:28] <Fraudbear> has this boomer never played reqch
[1:23:33] <SpicyBC> speaking of wraiths
[1:23:35] <ovan20> F
[1:23:39] <ThirdPersonPhil> ooh so this is why they gave you the shields XD
[1:23:40] <+AnonIdiot> Even now i recall the turtle fights
[1:23:41] <duathadruid> He has indeed never played reacharound
[1:23:45] <+D00msDayDan> @PlagueOfGripes hold tab for weapon details
[1:24:19] <+DesmondtheOrc> big artillery
[1:24:34] <+TheShisno> It's a laser designator
[1:24:40] <+DesmondtheOrc> "shoot is a go"
[1:24:49] <Fraudbear> playing Halo with a keyboard is like fucking your wife with another man's dick
[1:24:50] <+AnonIdiot> Armorlocking for days
[1:24:53] <SuperVaderMan> You did it, you point and clicked
[1:24:59] <stranger59> Now you get a burning warthog!
[1:24:59] <SpicyBC> I think he figured out what the weapon does by now, guys.
[1:25:09] <Dakuu75> lol
[1:25:16] <AbysmalWulf> LUL
[1:25:18] <duathadruid> Playing it with KB+M in PvP is hilarious though since everyone else is using a gamepad
[1:25:21] <htt0r1hnz0> Member that one time a SINGLE Covenant cruiser wiped out HALF a UNSC fleet?
[1:25:28] <JonKhan> Let Kat drive for a fun time!
[1:25:30] <+TheShisno> Yeah cause the AI never moved when you were hitting the pavement at 60mph, now they dodge
[1:25:36] <Fraudbear> @duathadruid ok cuck
[1:25:43] <SpicyBC> oh right, isn't it mouse controlled?
[1:25:45] <biomegabear> in what way worse?
[1:25:56] <TechDragon_Z> Never let the AI drive.
[1:25:58] <duathadruid> lmao cuck is an original insult
[1:26:09] <+AnonIdiot> Your driving with a mouse
[1:26:15] <duathadruid> Its not that bad once you get used to it, then again neither is CBT
[1:26:15] <stranger59> Apparently the sound is muffled, making everything feel weaker.
[1:26:18] <+AnonIdiot> Its worse
[1:26:20] <biomegabear> no
[1:26:32] <+DesmondtheOrc> I will say that thank fuck Warframe doesn't balance around the Crucible
[1:26:35] <+eanscrale> That's why Dark Souls 2 is the best one!
[1:26:43] <biomegabear> ODST
[1:26:43] <SpicyBC> odst
[1:26:46] <+TheShisno> ODST
[1:26:48] <+KaijuUltimax> Warthog turret feels limp without controller rumble
[1:26:48] <duathadruid> ODST
[1:26:49] <SpicyBC> literally ODST
[1:26:56] <stranger59> You mean that Halo rpg that got cancelled years ago?
[1:26:58] <tanarath> halo 1 just had different stats for each
[1:26:58] <FirewallStorm> ODST
[1:26:58] <+D00msDayDan> halo 5 plays well despite being balanced for pvp
[1:27:04] <+DesmondtheOrc> wait is ODST part of master chief collection?
[1:27:05] <htt0r1hnz0> ODST to the rescue
[1:27:10] <alrobot2014> yes it is
[1:27:10] <duathadruid> I will second that Halo 5 is not bad
[1:27:13] <Zola390> ODST
[1:27:14] <+CursedNobleman> reach is halo 4?
[1:27:14] <Fraudbear> Gosh what a Gen X Hipster
[1:27:16] <ovan20> LUL
[1:27:21] <stranger59> Yeah, ODST will come along eventually.
[1:27:28] <Zebroneath> That's what kinda ruined Halo 5 campaign, because there was stuff specifically designed for PvP that killed you in PvE
[1:27:36] <htt0r1hnz0> Man......
[1:27:38] <duathadruid> Orbital Drop Storm Trooper?
[1:27:44] <+DesmondtheOrc> It's halo but you play as a guy and it's all single player and really fucking strong
[1:27:44] <biomegabear> Oribital drop shock troopers. Normal soldier
[1:27:45] <htt0r1hnz0> Shock*
[1:27:45] <+Shotgundam009> Basically story dlc to Halo 3
[1:27:47] <stranger59> ODST is a Halo 3 based sidestory, basically.
[1:27:47] <duathadruid> Its basically halo but you play as a grunt
[1:27:52] <duathadruid> its about 50% Garbage
[1:27:53] <SpicyBC> It's actually pretty dang good
[1:27:53] <hntronium> AT STs AT STs
[1:27:53] <+AnonIdiot> Orbital drop shock trooper
[1:27:55] <+Shotgundam009> It's alright
[1:27:57] <+TheShisno> By your standarda, probably
[1:28:00] <Zola390> Orbital Drop Shock Troopers.
[1:28:05] <Zola390> it's okay.
[1:28:06] <SuperVaderMan> ODST is you're a dude, not a spartan. It's more exploration based, so maybe it'd be more your thing?
[1:28:13] <duathadruid> The city streets are garbage, which is about half the game
[1:28:18] <+CursedNobleman> is this campaign or multiplayer of some sort
[1:28:24] <biomegabear> yeah
[1:28:34] <Verriand> I stopped after 2. I did giggle when Halo Wars debuted
[1:28:49] <+DesmondtheOrc> odst also introduced firefight, one of the best game modes, because it's survival mode with friends
[1:28:50] <AbysmalWulf> It was good when Bungie was decent at making games.
[1:28:54] <tanarath> campaign, but what's great is that it's hard to tell.
[1:29:02] <+KaijuUltimax> Halo stopped being a thing because it ran it's course but then money man said "No, we need more money"
[1:29:08] <Fraudbear> Halo only bombed after 4
[1:29:09] <+CursedNobleman> LUL ?
[1:29:14] <+AnonIdiot> Warthog ass up in air
[1:29:32] <SpicyBC> the storytelling at the start was pretty nice for ODST, you were separated from your squad and had to travel a covenant taken city while piecing together what happened to everyone
[1:29:42] <+DesmondtheOrc> didn't the covenant just find reach by accident?
[1:29:45] <+CursedNobleman> i gotta look up the halo wiki and figger out why these grunt peon guys have humps LUL
[1:29:45] <htt0r1hnz0> Member when the makers of HALO 5 DIDN'T know who MASTER CHEIF was?
[1:29:47] <ThirdPersonPhil> Steal that vehicle
[1:29:54] <Dakuu75> oh wow, the A.I. legit trys sto ram you
[1:29:55] <+DesmondtheOrc> and were like "ok...?"
[1:29:57] <duathadruid> I think reach has 3 good things. The scene after the bomb. The epilogue mission. And the PvP.
[1:30:01] <+D00msDayDan> plague, at this point in the timeline most of the other human colonies are glass and reach is the last planet between the covenant and earth
[1:30:03] <SuperVaderMan> That's why the covenant being here is such a big deal in-story. They weren't supposed to find it
[1:30:16] <stranger59> Halo is like Star Wars, a lot of the details are in books and such.
[1:30:25] <kiwicoffin> They missed
[1:30:26] <duathadruid> Isnt reach like super close to earth too?
[1:30:27] <alrobot2014> found reach while looking for forerunner shit and were shocked to find humanity here iirc
[1:30:35] <stranger59> It wants you to press the button.
[1:30:39] <+corrosivePaladin> They keep missing
[1:30:44] <Fraudbear> nah that was Earth you trogs
[1:30:55] <+Shotgundam009> It doesn't follow moving targets
[1:31:37] <+corrosivePaladin> yes
[1:31:39] <+DesmondtheOrc> is this cannon hog?
[1:31:43] <Zebroneath> Yes
[1:31:49] <stranger59> I miss the Brute Chopper from 3. That's what I want to drive.
[1:31:51] <SpicyBC> it's basically useless now
[1:31:52] <ThirdPersonPhil> it was working on a cooldown before
[1:31:53] <SuperVaderMan> Yeah the targetter recharges in new areas
[1:31:57] <+DesmondtheOrc> it ran out of batteries
[1:32:09] <duathadruid> Imagine you make a Sci-Fi game and you have literally thousands of possible environment variations, and you choose to make your planet grey and brown, with some snow in the skybox
[1:32:10] <htt0r1hnz0> The ship in space prolly ran out
[1:32:19] <+Bellsbattle> It has story ammo LUL
[1:32:20] <+CursedNobleman> ooooh, the grunt humps are methane tanks, they suffocate if you punch them off. how sad LUL
[1:32:20] <stranger59> The sattelite ran out of missles.
[1:32:45] <Verriand> vroooom
[1:32:53] <SpicyBC> "I'm a race-car driver! wheeee!"
[1:32:58] <+AnonIdiot> Vvvvvrrrrroooooooooommmmmm
[1:33:05] <+CursedNobleman> push me daddy! LUL
[1:33:05] <Fraudbear> woman spartan needs a man to lift the car
[1:33:07] <+AnonIdiot> Beep beep
[1:33:21] <SpicyBC> time to drive the kids to school
[1:33:56] <+KaijuUltimax> Because the game is just that linear. Doesn't need waypoints
[1:34:05] <stranger59> Niiiice side swipe
[1:34:06] <+Bearjewpiter> don't mock me SMOrc
[1:34:18] <+CursedNobleman> multi track drifting PogChamp
[1:34:21] <SpicyBC> that would be hilarious
[1:34:54] <Verriand> what is that hot pink menace
[1:34:57] <SpicyBC> that's a fender-bender
[1:35:06] <duathadruid> God those things are such a pain in PvP
[1:35:10] <+AnonIdiot> The covey-hog
[1:35:10] <htt0r1hnz0> There's a two seat ghost? ......ew
[1:35:14] <+DesmondtheOrc> that's the spectre, it used to look better but not much
[1:35:19] <stranger59> Did Kat run all the way there?
[1:35:21] <duathadruid> It launches mini wraith shots
[1:35:32] <duathadruid> so its more like a mini wraith than a big ghost
[1:35:46] <duathadruid> still an abomination though, to be fair
[1:35:53] <SpicyBC> N-ergy
[1:36:06] <Fraudbear> N Word?
[1:36:10] <+DesmondtheOrc> THAKS KAT
[1:36:13] <kiwicoffin> Kat LUL
[1:36:18] <duathadruid> only emile can say that word
[1:37:12] <+askalta> i think on earth they sound like that because they breath helium or smth
[1:37:13] <SuperVaderMan> They wanted you to take the aliens seriously in this game, no fun allowed
[1:37:16] <Verriand> I guess they didnt speak wacky english ' back then'
[1:37:21] <+KaijuUltimax> So does Reach PC have forge and does that forge mode remove the limits of the console version?
[1:37:27] <SpicyBC> yeah this was the "Gritty war movie" halo
[1:37:43] <+Shotgundam009> I think you need the skull to make say silly stuff now
[1:37:51] <SpicyBC> Oh hey that one's got the boomstick
[1:37:55] <+askalta> railgun
[1:37:55] <+DesmondtheOrc> oh it's the bang hogger
[1:37:58] <JonKhan> GAUSS HOG
[1:37:59] <duathadruid> @HunterInABox Yeah reach on PC is completely modabble so you can do whatever now if you have the know how
[1:38:06] <Buiadaptive> As far as I know pc mcc doesn't have forge
[1:38:10] <+AnonIdiot> Gauss cannon
[1:38:13] <SpicyBC> kat can walk
[1:38:13] <stranger59> Gauss CANNON
[1:38:17] <Verriand> bang hogger is my new favorite name for a lot of thing
[1:38:20] <stranger59> You don't need Kat
[1:38:32] <SuperVaderMan> This guy LUL
[1:38:32] <+DesmondtheOrc> bruh
[1:38:35] <+AnonIdiot> Rail shot boomy boom

[1:38:44] <stranger59> He's sleepy
[1:38:51] <+Shotgundam009> Hes checking out the sea
[1:38:55] <+guardian_collin> Modern AI in a nutshell
[1:39:03] <DrkJP520> lol
[1:39:04] <SpicyBC> pffft
[1:39:05] <stranger59> He's a rogue AI!
[1:39:13] <Jammho> lmao
[1:39:15] <+DesmondtheOrc> he's like a scared animal
[1:39:16] <SpicyBC> "driving is haaard dur hurrr"
[1:39:17] <Buiadaptive> 400 MILLION STAB WOUNDS
[1:39:18] <tanarath> god
[1:39:18] <+eanscrale> Actually no
[1:39:18] <rubbersnake21> damn just like the old days
[1:39:19] <biomegabear> It shipped
[1:39:24] <Verriand> his AI is off the grid
[1:39:26] <Fraudbear> the fucking Covenant AI could practically get a Harvare degree tho
[1:39:27] <+eanscrale> I think it was reworked
[1:39:28] <stranger59> I've never seen them do this
[1:39:30] <+KaijuUltimax> Well, it was a SHIPPED game
[1:39:32] <tanarath> halo 1's ai was better
[1:39:39] <+CawffeeMike> Reach was a weird entry.
[1:39:39] <+DesmondtheOrc> ai might have been wonked in MCC
[1:39:40] <kappamutton> this is the greatest thing ever tho
[1:39:45] <biomegabear> besides 1 I think grunts drove for you
[1:39:59] <Neoripo> NEVER trust AI
[1:40:01] <+AnonIdiot> What the hell makes you think the a.i. was good?
[1:40:05] <Buiadaptive> well the audio design is definitely wonked
[1:40:09] <Jammho> thank you driver :) 7
[1:40:15] <+KaijuUltimax> plot twist: Not an AI issue, this guy just has never driven a car
[1:40:15] <eanscrale> I don't remember exactly but I remember there being a lot of changes to the initial campaign.
[1:40:17] <SpicyBC> not the best uber
[1:40:30] <biomegabear> PRESS F TO OPEN DOOR

[1:50:30] <htt0r1hnz0> Art is very important for the cultural enrichment for our community.
[1:50:34] <hntronium> They are like Thrawn, they will learn how to defeat the enemy through their art
[1:50:35] <+AnonIdiot> Its a major colony world
[1:50:39] <+askalta> its about using as much money as possible on uesless stuff so you can ask for more budget next year
[1:50:51] <luckyifpurple> They were building warrior poets but modern warriors make modern art
[1:50:52] <tanarath> It's the space cia, plague.
[1:50:56] <+KaijuUltimax> Gotta use up the budget or you'll lose it
[1:51:09] <hntronium> They will learn the weaknesses of their enemy by analyzing their art

[2:03:46] <Fraudbear> ONI Agents glow in the Dark
[2:03:48] <+KaijuUltimax> Dumb bitch thinks there's something more important going on than THE PLANET BEING ATTACKED
[2:03:48] <duathadruid> Even if you played Halo 1-3 and ODST, you wont understand hardly any of what the fuck is going on without EU knowledge

[2:05:15] <tanarath> Really, you only need to read Fall of Reach.
[2:05:21] <+AnonIdiot> Halo is a ring world
[2:05:23] <Paralurx> The story of Commander John Halo is becoming a tad convoluted

[2:06:24] <+KaijuUltimax> Why is it that all the other weapons can only hold like 5 magazines worth of ammo but the sniper can hold 60 fucking rounds in reserve?
[2:06:25] <Fraudbear> "Go in quiet" BOOOOOOM "Haha Nice"
[2:06:26] <Holycow8498> Yeah it's most certainly not
[2:06:29] <JonKhan> Now only people within 2 miles knows we are here
[2:06:34] <ThirdPersonPhil> halo was not built for a bunch of things
[2:06:42] <hntronium> Just keep going forward
[2:06:44] <SpicyBC> The goal is always to kill things, plague.
[2:06:44] <stranger59> Kill stuff until you push a button
[2:06:53] <zenith0111> Planet is being invaded... not much else happening LUL
[2:06:54] <+Shotgundam009> Even when they added silencers they forgot stealth mechanics lol
[2:07:02] <+gunslinger_xxiv> You're there to steal dyson spheres
[2:07:02] <biomegabear> least silenced riffle
[2:07:06] <Jammho> what are they sayiiiing
[2:07:11] <biomegabear> no its the same
[2:07:17] <redrix_3> you kinda failed the stealth part so just go guns blazing
[2:07:19] <$Jathspuh> They wanted you to backstab a bunch of dudes
[2:07:19] <+AntithesisEK> lmao
[2:07:28] <tanarath> You find the zealot teams and get the data?
[2:07:33] <zenith0111> Even in future space we can't get good walkie talkies :(
[2:07:37] <+DesmondtheOrc> I can feel the apathy infecting my twitch browse
[2:07:45] <Verriand> tried to roll out of that one
[2:07:45] <+KaijuUltimax> But how are you suppose to know it's the past if the radios don't sound like shit?
[2:08:02] <Fraudbear> its like the year 3000 and they still use pump action shotguns btw
[2:08:13] <cosmeleon> oh yea swap for the spraying gun in this ranged battle
[2:08:14] <+AnonIdiot> Mcc had been dropped more times then by an evil british nanny Should be allowed
[2:08:16] <+guardian_collin> we still use Pump Actions today
[2:08:18] <+gunslinger_xxiv> What's the distance that Cup + String stops working?
[2:08:18] <+KaijuUltimax> It's the year 3000 and they still use normal radios
[2:08:20] <zenith0111> Should've been quiet calebKek
[2:08:21] <Jammho> books bike bou beally bissed bem boff
[2:08:31] <$Jathspuh> LUL
[2:08:31] <duathadruid> Maybe the spartans would have better quality sound if they just used a fucking discord server
[2:08:34] <SpicyBC> oh god I hear it
[2:08:37] <cosmeleon> OW MY HAND
[2:08:47] <redrix_3> shhhhh
[2:08:51] <redrix_3> be quiet
[2:08:58] <Fraudbear> yeah
[2:08:59] <duathadruid> yes
[2:09:00] <Jammho> reach is known for its pvp mainly yeah
[2:09:01] <heartlessclown2> someone left the tap on
[2:09:01] <+DesmondtheOrc> reach has really really good multiplayer
[2:09:03] <zenith0111> Pretty much. And Forge
[2:09:03] <hntronium> You want to try the games after this and compare?
[2:09:03] <+crazyspartan214> yes
[2:09:03] <redrix_3> yeah
[2:09:04] <SpicyBC> that's all anyone remembers from halo games
[2:09:09] <redrix_3> swat
[2:09:12] <duathadruid> Reach PvP is the best in the series
[2:09:12] <+askalta> yeah, odst was the one praised for the campaign
[2:09:20] <+KaijuUltimax> Reach was a PVP focused game that marketed Mountain Dew Gamer Fuel
[2:09:20] <+guardian_collin> @SpicyBC and all the Cortana porn
[2:09:24] <tanarath> They also have an automatic .50 cal explosive pistol
[2:09:24] <hntronium> I liked the ending
[2:09:29] <Ironpierrot> The only good part of Reach was multiplayer
[2:09:32] <Futurecity10> It IS the last game
[2:09:34] <zenith0111> Most the campaign maps in reach are the pvp ones
[2:09:36] <SpicyBC> yeah that too
[2:09:36] <$Jathspuh> D:
[2:09:51] <+askalta> has plague played odst?
[2:09:58] <stranger59> Reach has Forgeworld, Reach will always get love for that.
[2:09:58] <$Jathspuh> he hasn't
[2:09:59] <FlatlordArtiq> reach was a bit of a special talking point because the story of the game contradicts the story of the beloved fall of reach novel
[2:10:00] <redrix_3> reach was 90% pvp and 10% forge
[2:10:01] <JonKhan> This is the one on the way down story wise
[2:10:02] <duathadruid> The final mission is p cool thematically though, art least thats what my high ass thought back in the day
[2:10:09] <+crazyspartan214> obi-wan?
[2:10:11] <+Shotgundam009> lol
[2:10:21] <ThirdPersonPhil> he clearly didn't
[2:10:21] <SuperVaderMan> he said what do you want LUL
[2:10:24] <+askalta> he forgot to takes his meds let it go
[2:10:25] <hntronium> your hearing must be going old man
[2:10:29] <Jammho> whats that noise btw
[2:10:29] <stranger59> Well, that's a name I haven't in...
[2:10:29] <Verriand> Ah, the Needler, the "the devs dont even know how it fucking works" weapon
[2:10:34] <zenith0111> What is the "theme" for Halo?
[2:10:39] <+crazyspartan214> go north
[2:10:42] <stranger59> You're Obi-Wan, you know where to go.
[2:10:46] <zenith0111> Don't fuck with Aliens?
[2:10:48] <+AnonIdiot> Old Man Gripe lol
[2:10:49] <SpicyBC> the finally stopped banging that pot
[2:10:49] <+guardian_collin> the theme of halo is shoot the big scary aliens
[2:11:00] <Fraudbear> lost old man
[2:11:11] <$Jathspuh> PogChamp
[2:11:11] <Jammho> WHY
[2:11:13] <Verriand> YOOO
[2:11:15] <SuperVaderMan> Finally, the fun is here
[2:11:15] <redrix_3> forklift hours
[2:11:17] <JonKhan> Fork Chan!
[2:11:18] <zenith0111> YEET
[2:11:19] <+AnonIdiot> Bruh
[2:11:20] <+KaijuUltimax> @zenith0111 There's an old and long running theory that Halo is supposed to be a sci-fi version of the crusades
[2:11:20] <SpicyBC> your stealth vehicle
[2:11:21] <redrix_3> lets go boys
[2:11:23] <+Lightburst> "STEALTH"
[2:11:24] <$Jathspuh> change your mind yet?
[2:11:24] <hntronium> You finally found you could drive them huh
[2:11:27] <+Shotgundam009> theme of halo is shoot aliens and look at ai butt
[2:11:27] <+gunslinger_xxiv> I was hoping the music started back up when you turned around
[2:11:27] <Verriand> IT BEEPS
[2:11:29] <redrix_3> beep beep
[2:11:32] <stranger59> YESSSS!
[2:11:36] <ThirdPersonPhil> VEHICLE FUNCTION 1 TO 3
[2:11:37] <cosmeleon> when are spartans trained to drive these
[2:11:44] <duathadruid> biggest travesty of the game, you cant make the fork go
[2:11:45] <Fraudbear> but Humies are the Saracens
[2:11:46] <duathadruid> YES
[2:11:47] <Jammho> vehicle reversing vehicle reversing
[2:11:50] <redrix_3> roleplay and imagine
[2:11:51] <duathadruid> he agrees with me
[2:11:54] <SpicyBC> Noble Six doesn't know how to use a forklift
[2:11:58] <stranger59> You can't raise the forks because people used it to get out of level/break the physics.
[2:11:58] <+crazyspartan214> no mechanic for forklift
[2:12:01] <$Jathspuh> it'd be too strong for multiplayer
[2:12:05] <duathadruid> space forklift
[2:12:08] <zenith0111> @hunterinabox That's hardly a theme. That's more of a premise
[2:12:09] <Fraudbear> Space forklit
[2:12:13] <+Shotgundam009> Space fork
[2:12:25] <JonKhan> The forklift is a suicide based weapon in this game
[2:12:28] <SpicyBC> Highly trained Spartan Agent does not know how to make the forky do the lift lift
[2:12:30] <Madbearv> it'll sink right
[2:12:33] <SuperVaderMan> Here I go, gonna bring the fight to the aliens
[2:12:35] <+ID_Griggs> Warehouse simulator 2019
[2:12:36] <+crazyspartan214> it going to get destroy
[2:12:37] <ThirdPersonPhil> how many achievements are tied to this forklift?
[2:12:39] <redrix_3> there are a bunch around the game
[2:12:39] <Cyral_Drive> beep beep
[2:12:41] <Jammho> ahaha
[2:12:44] <+askalta> shenmue 3 looks great
[2:12:44] <+Lightburst> LOL
[2:12:48] <$Jathspuh> good game PogChamp
[2:12:50] <Verriand> some one please tell me right now we can glitch and bring this thing with us forever
[2:13:04] <ChortlesJ1> It's just funny to think with all that type of gravity based equipment, the forklift would still be useful to society 500 years in the future
[2:13:09] <duathadruid> @askalta holy shit lol
[2:13:15] <+KaijuUltimax> The real Halo beings here
[2:13:25] <piggypig> now this IS HALO
[2:13:27] <$Jathspuh> monkaS
[2:13:31] <+jepupu> About to recreate some German workplace safety videos?
[2:13:33] <Jammho> LIFT EM UP
[2:13:36] <redrix_3> regret
[2:13:49] <+Lightburst> omg you checkpoitn in the lift!
[2:13:49] <SpicyBC> the forklift is eternal
[2:13:49] <hntronium> Don't the vehicle functions work?
[2:13:52] <+gunslinger_xxiv> Give em the forks!
[2:13:55] <+Lightburst> checkpoint*
[2:14:03] <zenith0111> Bungie clearly had a vision when making this...
[2:14:24] <duathadruid> the greatest supersoldier man has ever devised...and hees trying to drive a forklift up a narrow set of stair
[2:14:28] <redrix_3> if only the fallen order had forklifts i might have given it an 8/10
[2:14:34] <Verriand> finally, a spartan that actually lifts
[2:14:42] <gordieda20> LUL
[2:15:03] <duathadruid> Jorge lifts...that one time at least
[2:15:07] <kite1haseo> this is a better way to play the game
[2:15:18] <Verriand> Plague, the Forklift is getting cold
[2:15:18] <redrix_3> give them a fighting chance
[2:15:21] <+KaijuUltimax> I feel like a game where you operate heavy machinery is the perfect game for Plague
[2:15:29] <zenith0111> calebGasm
[2:15:36] <SpicyBC> what enemy could possibly be worthy of fighting the forklift?
[2:15:52] <cosmeleon> i want an elite to drive away in the forklift
[2:15:55] <redrix_3> this really brings the farmer out of plague
[2:16:02] <hntronium> Now that you mention it, I kind of heard 'that guy is an asshole' too
[2:16:11] <duathadruid> turn on grunt birthday party
[2:16:20] <ThirdPersonPhil> probably messing with your forklift
[2:16:24] <Ks201> i dont think they have the tech to translate the aliens yet
[2:16:28] <zenith0111> The M Rated game said a naughty joke? caleb3Head
[2:16:33] <+DailyOkami> in reach bungie changed the covenants voices so they don't speak English and they're more enemy sounding
[2:17:25] <duathadruid> pro quickscope
[2:17:39] <@Nightbot> Plague is a youtube animator and also streams at https://picarto.tv/Plague . Also: t-shirts! http://goo.gl/lze8QO
[2:17:51] <redrix_3> *proceeds to draw curvy forklift
[2:17:52] <SpicyBC> this is peak game design
[2:18:03] <$Jathspuh> PogChamp
[2:18:07] <$Jathspuh> LUL
[2:18:09] <SpicyBC> OH SHIT
[2:18:10] <@Nightbot> @crazyspartan214 -> You have my attention. [stop spamming emotes] [warning]
[2:18:12] <gordieda20> LUL
[2:18:12] <redrix_3> oh
[2:18:18] <SuperVaderMan> Forklift is invincible
[2:18:19] <redrix_3> ok
[2:18:23] <hntronium> FORKLIFT CHAN LIVES FOREVER
[2:18:24] <duathadruid> the fuck was that?
[2:18:28] <$Jathspuh> uh oh
[2:18:29] <Schuhart> This lighting is atrocious
[2:18:29] <duathadruid> I dont remember this shit
[2:18:29] <deligador> I saw 34 with this monster once.
[2:18:31] <+AnonIdiot> Todays news, Plague learns to forklift and Daisy Ridley gets privilege checked, can today be more lul-worty
[2:18:34] <SpicyBC> OH NO FORKLIFT CHAN
[2:18:38] <$Jathspuh> GET BACK TO THE FORK
[2:18:41] <hntronium> YOU WERE UNWORTHY PLAGUE
[2:18:46] <+KaijuUltimax> Is that the monster from Cloverfield?
[2:18:52] <piggypig> Fredlift
[2:18:57] <$Jathspuh> Fred tpKyawawa
[2:18:57] <SuperVaderMan> See as soon as you got knocked out of the forklift, you became vulnerable
[2:19:16] <Jammho> noooo
[2:19:17] <$Jathspuh> D:
[2:19:20] <+askalta> lol
[2:19:21] <hntronium> UNWORTHY

[2:19:37] <%caramello_man> FRED!!!!!
[2:19:46] <SpicyBC> *aggressive beeping*
[2:19:48] <$Jathspuh> PogChamp
[2:19:49] <+KaijuUltimax> Nice
[2:19:52] <Jammho> Insane Stunt bonus
[2:19:55] <SuperVaderMan> Did you kill that one by landing on it? LUL
[2:19:55] <redrix_3> holy shit
[2:19:56] <SpicyBC> wait did he just land on the fucking thing
[2:20:01] <$Jathspuh> Yeah LUL
[2:20:02] <piggypig> truly the working class can rise up now
[2:20:19] <SpicyBC> fred's stuck
[2:20:20] <duathadruid> gamers rise up
[2:20:21] <deligador> Fork stuck, fork stuck, please, i beg you

[2:20:36] <SuperVaderMan> Just lift the whole world
[2:20:39] <stranger59> This is Fred's home now.
[2:20:43] <+AnonIdiot> Damn
[2:20:47] <+spodebroker> >see Eli is playing Halo >click >see a forklift fighting a cave troll
[2:20:50] <deligador> F
[2:20:51] <SpicyBC> oh
[2:20:56] <hntronium> Forklift did not want to leave
[2:20:56] <stranger59> hahahahaha
[2:20:58] <redrix_3> nice
[2:20:58] <+spodebroker> This game is uh, is different than I remember it being in college.
[2:21:02] <SuperVaderMan> Fred did not appreciate that
[2:21:04] <hntronium> So he denied you your joy and killed you
[2:21:14] <bear_breaker20> t-this halo?
[2:21:29] <%caramello_man> I ownder if you can clip out of world like this
[2:21:36] <SpicyBC> FRED NOOOOO
[2:21:41] <%caramello_man> *wonder
[2:21:44] <ThirdPersonPhil> tehre was another forklift just before this section
[2:22:03] <Crunkle_Dunkle> CUNTa
[2:22:10] <ThirdPersonPhil> clone your dead forklift pet
[2:22:10] <Fraudbear> guta more like puta
[2:22:17] <Verriand> we can't look back. But we'll always remember
[2:22:33] <SpicyBC> depression is a world that is fred-less
[2:22:55] <Fraudbear> shot the civilians
[2:23:08] <Fraudbear> its prime warcrime time
[2:23:17] <$Jathspuh> https://clips.twitch.tv/PunchyEncouragingCookieGingerPower fred's takedown clip
[2:23:30] <duathadruid> its both?
[2:23:30] <TheSonOfTheBeast> did you really reference Fred the 2008 youtube superstar?
[2:23:39] <$Jathspuh> D:
[2:23:39] <redrix_3> i think you can get a secondary zoom on the sniper
[2:23:42] <Fraudbear> HNNNNNG
[2:23:42] <deligador> Reach reminds me about Republic Commando.
[2:23:48] <Futurecity10> Reach is the center of the unsc’s military
[2:23:52] <+bzedude4> Jesus it looked at you first
[2:23:53] <ScreamLord> Scanners
[2:24:08] <stranger59> I think the military get like a continent or something, but easier to have farmers and such elsewhere.
[2:24:44] <stranger59> It's like the whole world is the town next to the army base.
[2:24:56] <SpicyBC> Elites are trained to juke for days
[2:25:42] <ScreamLord> Jun's probably my favorite member of Nobel Team
[2:26:15] <redrix_3> pro player plague strats
[2:27:25] <TheSonOfTheBeast> i always felt bad killing the grunts when they ran like that
[2:27:36] <Fraudbear> lol pussy
[2:27:50] <Ageingyoungrebel> "when i was younger i cared to get better at things" ain't that life
[2:28:24] <ScreamLord> So apparently snapping someones neck like you just did that Grunt doesn't work. Apparently you'd need to be able to generate so much torque you'd probably rip their head of instead
[2:28:35] <+KaijuUltimax> Dedicated Marksman Rifle
[2:28:38] <ScreamLord> Dedicated Marksmen Rifle
[2:28:38] <duathadruid> This one fires one bullet at a time
[2:28:39] <SuperVaderMan> The battle rifles were 3-shot weapons, this one's different
[2:28:40] <+Tunnelcakesrule> they changed its name later on
[2:28:40] <hntronium> Designated
[2:28:41] <deligador> Mood
[2:28:51] <duathadruid> shoot da gun
[2:28:52] <redrix_3> battles are bursts dmr are single shot
[2:29:07] <ScreamLord> The Battle Rifle is a 3-shot burst
[2:29:09] <Verriand> Ah, Nick, Luke, Drew and FRRRTHHH
[2:29:14] <hntronium> He is
[2:29:17] <duathadruid> i was just gonna say fighting games lmao
[2:29:20] <hntronium> And its an abortion of a playthrough
[2:29:20] <alrobot2014> he's streaming his lps now
[2:29:26] <SpicyBC> that bird was a war criminal
[2:29:28] <hntronium> He'll finish it in about three years
[2:29:30] <duathadruid> Death stranding is kind of a fighting game
[2:30:09] <stranger59> When does it hit PC?
[2:30:19] <+KaijuUltimax> Death Stranding hits PC sometime next year
[2:30:26] <+KaijuUltimax> Likely late next year
[2:30:27] <ScreamLord> If you kill 7 of those Space Emus in the first mission you get a banner for it
[2:30:34] <stranger59> Okay, I can deal with that
[2:30:37] <SuperVaderMan> STEALTH
[2:30:54] <+KaijuUltimax> I can't wait for Death Stranding mods
[2:30:55] <+QuasartheHero> @screamlord doing what the auzs couldn't
[2:31:05] <Verriand> Stealth mission lads, get your louderners
[2:31:09] <ScreamLord> @QuasartheHero LUL
[2:31:11] <redrix_3> if you make enough noise it will be outside the frequency you or the aliens can hear so really this is the mkst stealthy
[2:31:15] <redrix_3> most*
[2:31:21] <+QuasartheHero> dmr best gun in the game
[2:31:22] <stranger59> So in Star Trek can you just make all the sniper rounds you want?
[2:31:37] <+QuasartheHero> bitterBirth
[2:31:44] <Fraudbear> what was plagues take on death stranding?
[2:31:52] <+KaijuUltimax> In Star Trek you don't use mineral based munitions
[2:31:58] <+QuasartheHero> @fraudbear neutral
[2:32:11] <duathadruid> @HunterInABox but what if you have to fight jedi?
[2:32:16] <darkbotle> Shoot the Halo things
[2:32:17] <stranger59> Just replicate a sniper rifle as well.
[2:32:26] <$Jathspuh> this part can be rough
[2:32:43] <zerocruz> Can’t wait for Plague to draw Halo porn
[2:32:54] <redrix_3> hunter waifus
[2:32:55] <duathadruid> NOOOO! FORKIE!!!!
[2:33:05] <ScreamLord> My favorite thing about Reach is how sometimes if you shoot of a Grunt's tank they go flying like an untied balloon
[2:33:11] <+QuasartheHero> there should be chain guns on the cov thing
[2:33:26] <stranger59> Don't you walk around and build stuff in real life?
[2:33:32] <darkbotle> well, did you get likes for your buildings?
[2:33:37] <+KaijuUltimax> That's another thing. This is how many hundreds of years into the future and humanity is still using mineral based munitions and hasn't gone to energy or plasma weapons themselves? Seems a little illconsidrered
[2:33:46] <deligador> Useless because everyone already build everything.
[2:34:19] <$Jathspuh> h-he's fast
[2:34:28] <TheSonOfTheBeast> what a battle
[2:34:28] <Fraudbear> HAYAI
[2:34:44] <+Spotspid> @HunterInABox It's meant to be scifi but you wouldn't relate to humanity in the future if it was 100% different, they need to show advancements while keeping it relatable, plus who's to say it uses what we use now for bullets? I know for a fact in the lore that's not true.
[2:35:00] <+QuasartheHero> 70% of it comes at the back end
[2:35:00] <Futurecity10> You actually unlock a title if you kill something with the forklift
[2:35:40] <zerocruz> Hunter HATE getting shot on the back
[2:35:42] <darkbotle> tbf they live in the literal apocalypse and are high on drugs
[2:35:56] <hntronium> plague's sixth sense is incredible
[2:36:17] <duathadruid> @hntronium For fucking real lol
[2:36:25] <+QuasartheHero> the fact that shes says " make us whole" just gave me all the no no dead space vibes
[2:36:37] <redrix_3> what do you think of nier automata?
[2:37:00] <Fraudbear> Dead Space, now that was a good game -sip-
[2:37:34] <+QuasartheHero> @fraudbear to bad they only made only 2 games
[2:37:38] <Fraudbear> grunte beat up women
[2:37:40] <+QuasartheHero> sounds about right
[2:37:43] <piggypig> grunts are inbread slaves that LOVE being slaves
[2:37:51] <Futurecity10> No those are the jackles I think
[2:37:55] <+crazyspartan214> I remember they started the Grunt Rebellion

[2:39:39] <biomegabear> shadw turrets
[2:39:39] <redrix_3> this something plague should not be saying
[2:39:41] <+KaijuUltimax> "Mmm, inbread" Homer Simpson says as he starts frothing at the mouth

[2:40:37] <FirewallStorm> oops caps
[2:40:50] <+KaijuUltimax> I believe Martin worked on all of them except 5
[2:40:56] <biomegabear> he did
[2:41:14] <kiwiredgrave> "Awww, is this war to hard for you, little baby militiaman?"
[2:41:16] <darkbotle> oh yes, an inbread meat sandwich
[2:41:20] <$Jathspuh> Kreygasm
[2:41:40] <deligador> ChefFrank
[2:41:42] <LeBlanc233> it is forbidden
[2:41:50] <hntronium> it is known
[2:41:53] <hntronium> this is the way
[2:41:55] <$Jathspuh> shhhhh
[2:42:00] <biomegabear> he found ammo for that sniper
[2:42:02] <SuperVaderMan> There's a lot of butt shots in this game
[2:42:07] <Schuhart> BANG BANG BANG sssssh
[2:42:18] <redrix_3> yes
[2:42:19] <+KaijuUltimax> The mission would have been like 4x longer if you actually stealthed it
[2:42:22] <Zebroneath> I'm sure the hundred of ships that have notified your awareness mean nothing.
[2:42:24] <Zooperton> it's the ghostbuster 2 goo
[2:42:30] <hntronium> big ship
[2:42:41] <kiwiredgrave> a bunch of shields like in the phantom menace
[2:42:49] <Fraudbear> this is the dumbedt cutscene in halo
[2:42:50] <FirewallStorm> it's supposed to be all the lights from the Covenant
[2:42:54] <darkbotle> Remember that gif from that splinter cell game where everything is exploding and it has STEALTH in big letters on it?
[2:43:01] <+QuasartheHero> love this mission
[2:43:14] <+QuasartheHero> also remember kats ai is busted in this mission
[2:43:21] <Ynkubus18> Hey, the worked til you showed up
[2:43:22] <biomegabear> just the tip of the spear
[2:43:41] <SuperVaderMan> No it's perfect military strategy, whatever could you mean
[2:43:55] <kiwiredgrave> that was the pylon from the mission before you had to defend
[2:44:04] <+KaijuUltimax> Yeah man, just lineup, it's totally not the reason why the English lost the war on the American colonies or anything
[2:44:12] <Fraudbear> these are somalian warlord strategies
[2:44:13] <SquigglyLizard> is this stealth?
[2:44:15] <$Jathspuh> D:
[2:44:30] <hntronium> spartans lead the way
[2:44:34] <DrkJP520> Where is Mustard Queef at this point?
[2:44:37] <darkbotle> but arent the spartans like 500 pounds or something?
[2:44:43] <+2hutown> This is some Iraq War shit
[2:44:45] <$Jathspuh> the warthog with all the spartans in it should be heavier
[2:44:46] <+AntithesisEK> becoming a super soldier to remove my speeding limiters
[2:44:49] <+corrosivePaladin> thats a grenade launcher that can charge the nade into an emp
[2:45:07] <+QuasartheHero> im pretty sure it also stuns vehicles
[2:45:14] <stranger59> This is a great level if you don't let Kat drive.
[2:45:19] <redrix_3> the grenade launcher was actally fun in pvp
[2:45:27] <Ironpierrot> Plague are you going to stream more often or we to continue to sup on these meager offerings of your sexy voice?
[2:45:39] <Ynkubus18> it also tells you how many dudes are near the nade too on the gun
[2:46:06] <+KaijuUltimax> That's an AA gun
[2:46:26] <hntronium> gonna raid woolie?
[2:46:29] <hntronium> yeyeye
[2:46:35] <hntronium> I liked Reach actually
[2:46:39] <+guardian_collin> Halo? more like Gaylo
[2:46:41] <deligador> 6/10
[2:46:45] <stranger59> I'm gonna play some Reach after this, actually.
[2:46:45] <+QuasartheHero> its my favorite halo
[2:46:45] <$Jathspuh> I liked it, but it lacks impact today
[2:46:48] <+KaijuUltimax> Never really liked Reach
[2:46:56] <SuperVaderMan> Reach is fine
[2:46:56] <hntronium> Still better than all the games after it
[2:46:59] <+bzedude4> It's my faverit
[2:47:04] <biomegabear> its okay.
[2:47:06] <stranger59> I'll be happier when 3 is on PC, but I have fun so far.
[2:47:08] <Cyral_Drive> its ok
[2:47:15] <redrix_3> it really was just 90% pvp 10% forge
[2:47:17] <duathadruid> I played the PvP a ton and the last mission over and over, other than that its just okay
[2:47:18] <Verriand> Forklift though
[2:47:30] <duathadruid> Forge was also good
[2:47:40] <stranger59> Can you make the Forklift an objective in multiplayer yet?
[2:47:50] <hntronium> Draw forklifts
[2:47:57] <biomegabear> maybe play 3 on stream
[2:47:58] <$Jathspuh> Good luck, Eli tpKyawawa tpKyawawa
[2:47:59] <stranger59> Thanks for the stream!
