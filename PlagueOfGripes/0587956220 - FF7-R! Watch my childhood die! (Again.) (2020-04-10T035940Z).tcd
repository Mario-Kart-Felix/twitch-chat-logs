[0:00:47] <KellBeII> it looks nice
[0:00:50] <overfiend_> hi
[0:00:54] <%bettysharkface> Oh boy, is it time ghost time?
[0:01:16] <+radiocrawler> Cheers, Eli and chat.
[0:01:34] <+Gabriel_Wright_Dunn> Hello there/
[0:01:35] <shadowblazer1> please do
[0:01:38] <%bettysharkface> Look at this layout, how profess
[0:01:47] <RayMan799> how long is game anyway? 40hrs of just midgar??
[0:01:53] <RayMan799> *this game
[0:02:04] <+Gabriel_Wright_Dunn> I think I know.
[0:02:07] <overfiend_> oh you're in the know
[0:02:14] <+Gabriel_Wright_Dunn> I've heard some "controversial" things about this game.
[0:02:15] <@Nightbot> Plague is a youtube animator and also streams at https://picarto.tv/Plague . Also: t-shirts! http://goo.gl/lze8QO
[0:02:46] <+radiocrawler> How much do we know about Midgar? Enough to know about differing piles of bricks?
[0:02:57] <+radiocrawler> I’m so looking forward to exploring this world
[0:03:57] <MoistBananaPudd> sugoiPino2 Hello everyone
[0:04:08] <stanleybeamer> @plagueofgripes youre the reason im never able to sleep at night and im an alcoholic
[0:04:24] <Brunothebodyguard> how's the farm
[0:05:14] <Jay444111> Heya Plague!
[0:05:15] <stanleybeamer> holy shit its the big titty woman
[0:05:20] <+radiocrawler> FF7 is one of my favorite games as well. I get giddy when it comes to FF7.
[0:05:48] <+radiocrawler> I like this change with Aerith. Something scares her in the shadows.
[0:06:41] <Jay444111> I am very unhappy with that too Plague.
[0:06:46] <%bettysharkface> It'll probably be fine.
[0:06:51] <FinchBot> youve been spoiled for the ending?
[0:07:07] <stanleybeamer> i cant wait until they make new hentai of tifa
[0:07:10] <$sleepy_coffee> How’s it going
[0:07:17] <Jay444111> Has Nomura gone too far?
[0:07:52] <medril07> whoooo
[0:07:56] <+radiocrawler> Cloud always having to make an entrance.
[0:08:03] <Triblade1992> I say that the game did what it needed to do and be a Remake. People don't seem to understand the difference between a REMAKE and a REMASTER.
[0:08:07] <stanleybeamer> lol
[0:08:28] <Jay444111> We were all misled Triblade. We all wanted the same story with fancy graphics.
[0:08:32] <xxmedusaoxx> is this coming out tomorrow?!
[0:08:35] <stanleybeamer> cloud is such a dumbass in this
[0:08:43] <+AwkwardSnails> you can turn it off
[0:08:48] <medril07> the thirst is extreme
[0:08:54] <+radiocrawler> Thirsty Jessie
[0:09:01] <sniffy77> OH MAN IS SHE THIRSTY
[0:09:12] <Triblade1992> @Jay444111 .....that's not what a remake is. Nomura even said the game would have changes to the plot and if you just want the original game to just play FF7 on the PS4, Xbone and Switch
[0:09:21] <stanleybeamer> does she try sucking him off in front of everyone?
[0:09:25] <$sleepy_coffee> Oh man them warnings while you cleave a man in half
[0:09:42] <+Gabriel_Wright_Dunn> That explains muscle memory.
[0:09:44] <medril07> top left has a shortcut
[0:09:59] <%hgtarras> Nice layout
[0:10:42] <Futurecity10> plague, did you watch pat play at all?
[0:10:45] <stanleybeamer> i like how cloud goes up against people with guns using a big dumbass sword
[0:10:56] <+radiocrawler> Marcus obliterated the demo with no heals whatsoever. It was such a blast to watch. enbGood
[0:11:14] <%caramello_man> phantom pain
[0:11:15] <%hgtarras> Ground 0
[0:11:15] <Huntercd> Ground zeroes?
[0:11:22] <stanleybeamer> how big is clouds cock o.o
[0:11:40] <+fingalights> Biggs wants it too
[0:11:56] <stanleybeamer> wedge has a pirate fetish
[0:12:04] <+radiocrawler> Wedge being Breaking Bad’s actor is pretty fitting. They made a good choice.
[0:12:18] <conchubar11> which actor?
[0:12:23] <overfiend_> lol
[0:12:49] <Jay444111> Barret has a great redesign.
[0:12:53] <Rodzzila> Wedge looks like he is 13
[0:12:59] <+radiocrawler> Jessie’s friend. I can’t remember the animal.
[0:13:07] <stanleybeamer> its nice he has dog tags outside of his shirt
[0:13:11] <terminusterminal> I managed to dodge the FF7 spoilers because I have no intention of playing the game. I only know it goes to hell and I'm super excited
[0:13:11] <Futurecity10> yeah, he's Pauls son from Goofy movie
[0:13:16] <extradopeness> Oh yeah Wedge is one of the Schrute cousins
[0:13:36] <extradopeness> Well his VA lol
[0:14:11] <stanleybeamer> any actual soldier who has their dog tags hanging out of their shirt is a bitch
[0:14:44] <+BonewheelVanguard> Hello, I hale from the land of Fuckboivin
[0:14:45] <+radiocrawler> Oh X slows down the game?? That’s good to know
[0:14:56] <Rodzzila> "process that" LUL
[0:15:19] <Brunothebodyguard> plague you ever find out what happened to that channel that did animations of y
[0:15:24] <Brunothebodyguard> ya
[0:15:47] <@PeachSaliva> Eliiiiii
[0:15:48] <+Gabriel_Wright_Dunn> Like Chrono Trigger?
[0:15:54] <+radiocrawler> They did a really ace job with this combat formula.
[0:15:57] <KellBeII> it peach
[0:16:05] <@PeachSaliva> Show feet
[0:16:06] <Shotred> I just want a good FF6 remake.
[0:16:09] <+radiocrawler> Yo Peach
[0:16:17] <terminusterminal> I think the risk system is also a major factor too
[0:16:22] <warmnoid> parasite eve remake never
[0:16:22] <+fingalights> Remake/Remaster of VS would be amazing
[0:16:23] <KellBeII> do not pls
[0:16:23] <+BonewheelVanguard> no feet only skeleton
[0:16:27] <CursedNobleman> PlagueCam!
[0:16:36] <CursedNobleman> uhhhhhhhhhhhh
[0:16:37] <Brunothebodyguard> peach sativa
[0:16:41] <stanleybeamer> @plagueofgripes alright im gonna go jerk off in my girlfriends hair and pass out on top of her have a fun stream
[0:16:53] <KaiserMario> Oh hey! Tom Segura is playing FF7!
[0:16:53] <stanleybeamer> also hi bye peach
[0:17:14] <+doc_ock_rokc> They added in a ton of stuf
[0:17:31] <+radiocrawler> I’m a real big fan of this combat system. They did a great job.
[0:17:34] <+Gabriel_Wright_Dunn> Good thing those bodies are self-disposing.
[0:17:50] <Rodzzila> Haven't play the demo and the most similar I can think I tried is the "Tales of ..." games. How does the combat compared to that?
[0:18:27] <CursedNobleman> similar, depending on the tales one
[0:18:35] <CursedNobleman> its like kingdom hearts or FF15 or whatever
[0:18:48] <+psydaku> Morning Eli!!
[0:18:51] <CursedNobleman> ive only played tales of symphonia or abyss myself
[0:19:10] <%hgtarras> I’m waiting for a year to get this on xbox. Because i have a feeling the second part will be out by the
[0:19:13] <CursedNobleman> LUL
[0:19:13] <%hgtarras> The
[0:19:13] <Huntercd> Was Jessie thirsty in the Demo?
[0:19:14] <%hgtarras> Then
[0:19:16] <FinchBot> LUL
[0:19:16] <%JailShmixRemix> The models in this game are amazing
[0:19:18] <Johnmaddened> LUL
[0:19:25] <KaiserMario> Well, if there's christmas in Midgard, there also a Jesus
[0:19:36] <FinchBot> wink, wink
[0:19:52] <+doc_ock_rokc> Wedge is bulky but not fat
[0:20:00] <+Gabriel_Wright_Dunn> https://clips.twitch.tv/SmallSaltySrirachaSpicyBoy
[0:20:02] <+doc_ock_rokc> Maybe
[0:20:08] <KellBeII> looks like a west virginian man
[0:20:23] <KaiserMario> Wide boy
[0:20:24] <Brunothebodyguard> corn fed
[0:20:24] <CursedNobleman> wedge working on that self-love
[0:20:48] <+radiocrawler> Badger! God damn I finally remembered the name.
[0:20:49] <+JoshuatheBlue> I thought it was mayko, not mahko
[0:20:49] <Shotred> damn gripe talking about d
[0:20:53] <+Neoripo> Stamp is Shinra's mascot
[0:21:02] <Brunothebodyguard> how much does cloud spend on haircare products
[0:21:07] <+Neoripo> A beagle
[0:21:21] <+radiocrawler> Stamp the Shinra mascot.
[0:21:31] <+doc_ock_rokc> Dogs are always important
[0:21:37] <+doc_ock_rokc> Because they are good
[0:21:37] <CursedNobleman> how much do you know about the game? demo only?
[0:21:39] <+Neoripo> World building
[0:21:41] <KaiserMario> @PlagueOfGripes Do you get annoyed at a fictional world like this, also has dogs and cats, instead of alien looking pets, like a mini-coeurl?
[0:21:46] <+Gabriel_Wright_Dunn> That makes sense.
[0:21:46] <Shotred> I forgot about stamp
[0:22:03] <%JailShmixRemix> Wtf thats racist
[0:22:08] <+Gabriel_Wright_Dunn> Seeing as how it'd Barret would be pronounced in Japanese.
[0:22:17] <+Gabriel_Wright_Dunn> But I guess because he's black.
[0:22:40] <+radiocrawler> Dark Souls almost called it Dark Ring and that would have been awkward.
[0:22:51] <CursedNobleman> its estimated at 80-105 lbs
[0:22:52] <KellBeII> ew beserk reference
[0:22:52] <+JoshuatheBlue> You'd think it's the Dragon Slayer
[0:22:56] <%JailShmixRemix> It's a lot different from gut's sword in that way
[0:23:02] <CursedNobleman> claymore is 5.5lbs
[0:23:09] <deligador> I think Cloud looked less feminine in alpha.
[0:23:12] <+Neoripo> It can actually cut, unlike Guts's sword
[0:23:25] <Jrockoni> a sword weighs around 2 to 3 on average
[0:23:31] <+doc_ock_rokc> If it was titanium it would be about...70-100 pounds
[0:23:35] <+JoshuatheBlue> So is Jessie just as thirsty?
[0:23:47] <+radiocrawler> Apparently she’s thirstier.
[0:24:04] <CursedNobleman> jessies booby armor bugs me
[0:24:20] <+Gabriel_Wright_Dunn> I thought to emphasize Cloud's super strength.
[0:24:32] <+Gabriel_Wright_Dunn> The sword not seeming to be heavy.
[0:24:34] <+JoshuatheBlue> Boob armor in anything is weird
[0:24:52] <+Neoripo> The three-button corridor
[0:25:12] <Brunothebodyguard> gotta protect the nips with armor
[0:25:13] <Shotred> as someone who has swords and guns ,
[0:25:13] <SonRyzGaming956> so this beta is one of those bitches that cries about everything nitpicking
[0:25:14] <KaiserMario> Not only she has boob armor, but it's a weird, pointy, looking one...
[0:25:34] <Shotred> it depends on the weapon
[0:25:46] <+radiocrawler> They kept it huh
[0:25:57] <mizamar> hello Plague and chat HeyGuys
[0:25:59] <terminusterminal> Was there something odd about her hair to head proportion?
[0:26:04] <CursedNobleman> huhhm, i looked it up, and the japanese nodachi weighs 32lbs
[0:26:05] <FinchBot> she looks like she wearing a bullet bra
[0:26:17] <CursedNobleman> nodachi being something similar to sephs sword
[0:26:41] <frostiecrow> in the original midgard is like 5 to 10 hours in here is like 40 because the chapter format of the remake
[0:26:42] <KellBeII> i kinda dont like that approach to remaking it. i never touched the original so i have no clue whats going on
[0:26:46] <+doc_ock_rokc> It kinda does if "Crisis Core" is canon
[0:27:01] <Betofall> which member tried to kill him biggs? wedge?
[0:27:07] <CursedNobleman> i mean, if they had this grade of surveilance, they should shutdown the elevator and have the bots tear the reactor down with them inside. but whatever
[0:27:10] <+Cosmic_Shark> hiya
[0:27:13] <+JoshuatheBlue> Again, isn't it may-ko, not mah-ko?
[0:27:22] <+Neoripo> Barret is just nervous
[0:27:23] <Shotred> it is a remake so they can change all types of things
[0:27:39] <+radiocrawler> I do like that they orchestrated the blast. The original references Jessie not knowing why her bomb blew up so huge. It makes sense.
[0:27:46] <Jrockoni> Barrett must be paying cloud pretty good for Cloud to put up with the bullshit.
[0:27:55] <CursedNobleman> 2000 gil?
[0:28:17] <Jrockoni> and a beer
[0:28:18] <Shotred> I just want to see Vincent and Sid. no getting this game till its complete.
[0:28:19] <+radiocrawler> I’m probably going to play this in Japanese with English subtitles.
[0:28:44] <+Cosmic_Shark> Don't think too hard about it.
[0:28:47] <CursedNobleman> oh you have no idea LUL
[0:28:48] <KaiserMario> Yes
[0:29:06] <friozen> holy dam plague! why aren't you drawing nakez girls?
[0:29:09] <+SL33P_WALK3R> JESSIE DIES AERITH DIES BIGGS DIES WEDGE DIES
[0:29:11] <deligador> Nice damage.
[0:29:17] <Brunothebodyguard> she has shoulder armor but no leg armor
[0:29:18] <JohnClaggart> nice layout, eli
[0:29:31] <mr_slaide> WE LOVE YOU, PLAGUE!
[0:29:45] <+Gabriel_Wright_Dunn> I get like that with Bullet Hell games.
[0:29:51] <+Gabriel_Wright_Dunn> Since I'm not too good at them.
[0:30:12] <OminousBagel> LUL
[0:30:12] <medril07> hhahaha
[0:30:16] <+doc_ock_rokc> @SL33P_WALK3R and Snape kills Dumbledoor with rosebud after he reveals he is harry's father
[0:30:17] <Good_Snacks> DU DU DU DU DUUUU
[0:30:18] <+Gabriel_Wright_Dunn> protonLOL
[0:30:26] <+Neoripo> Barret can not be stoped
[0:30:27] <Johnmaddened> no cake, only icing
[0:30:35] <WarchiefGoldva> The cake IS done, Plague. You're eating it right now!
[0:30:48] <+JoshuatheBlue> Why would they have lasers turning on and off?
[0:30:49] <+AwkwardSnails> defintitly
[0:30:49] <mizamar> yes
[0:30:50] <+radiocrawler> That level song wasn’t warranted, Barret.
[0:30:50] <medril07> yeah
[0:30:51] <%JailShmixRemix> Definitely
[0:30:53] <Betofall> chocobo girl
[0:30:59] <KaiserMario> For sure horse-girl
[0:31:06] <JohnClaggart> tifa was into acting and dance
[0:31:07] <deligador> Number 15 girl.
[0:31:12] <KellBeII> those lasers care kinda wide apart couldnt you just walk in between them?
[0:31:12] <JohnClaggart> i mean jessie
[0:31:15] <Brunothebodyguard> moogle girls
[0:31:27] <MrHappyFunshine> remove the -se from horse and i think you are right Eli
[0:31:29] <+radiocrawler> I will say that lasers are stupid.
[0:31:41] <%caramello_man> i wish barrett was just swearing in the background as he gets fucked by lasers
[0:32:00] <FinchBot> i would hate to work here with all these lasers at my job
[0:32:05] <Brunothebodyguard> hor
[0:32:08] <+JoshuatheBlue> If they know where they are or where they're going, why not keep the lasers on indefinitely?
[0:32:12] <WarchiefGoldva> Do you think Jessie has an adult toy collection in her house?
[0:32:21] <mr_slaide> Pfft. There are far more laser barriers at my hob.
[0:32:24] <mr_slaide> job too.
[0:32:35] <JohnClaggart> she lives with three other girls, so yes
[0:32:41] <Brunothebodyguard> FF Bad Dragon
[0:32:46] <approachingdeath> A little laser amputation, as a treat
[0:33:03] <BrachyZoid> Maybe they wanted you to rely on the other party members
[0:33:09] <medril07> like a squall as it were
[0:33:13] <+radiocrawler> There’s no putting Barret in the back row this time.
[0:33:26] <mr_slaide> If you nudge vapor, do you call it it a Vaporub? I'll leave now.
[0:33:35] <medril07> you can use it
[0:33:45] <fruit_pie_the_magician> But there's no air or cloud magic so it would be hard to theme him. Unless they added more than just aero
[0:33:47] <KaiserMario> In-game menu
[0:33:50] <medril07> x button
[0:33:57] <$sleepy_coffee> Cloud is good at being a hoe
[0:34:00] <JohnClaggart> it was l1 and circle
[0:34:11] <Betofall> bye bye all materia
[0:34:15] <medril07> he is a big boy
[0:34:20] <ScreamLord> Did I miss Berret screaming his ass off about Mako?
[0:34:26] <medril07> possibly... HUGE?
[0:34:46] <mr_slaide> Jessie is best girl.
[0:35:06] <+radiocrawler> I really enjoy the lighting through those grates.
[0:35:07] <+JoshuatheBlue> Big Gun McShoot
[0:35:10] <medril07> cleaners porbs
[0:35:10] <ScreamLord> Jessie want's Cloud's dik so bad in this game. She wants that Thunderhead
[0:35:12] <medril07> probs
[0:35:19] <KellBeII> looks like an old hot-rod car with turrets attached
[0:35:23] <Shotred> probably duster lol
[0:35:45] <+radiocrawler> Hell House I have no idea what they are going to do.
[0:36:10] <JohnClaggart> they're gonna put in hell house
[0:36:22] <terminusterminal> Was it Dean Takahashi again?
[0:36:28] <+Neoripo> Was it the guy that sucked at Cuphead?
[0:36:29] <+AwkwardSnails> some e journalist
[0:36:32] <ScreamLord> You mean all Game Journalists?
[0:36:37] <JohnClaggart> yeah, the guy who couldnt beat the cuphead tutorial
[0:36:51] <+radiocrawler> Just another pos journalist probably. I hadn’t heard about this.
[0:37:01] <+doc_ock_rokc> @terminusterminal Im not insure it was Dean this time around....THIS time
[0:37:30] <ScreamLord> He probably thinks Tetris and Snake are too difficult
[0:37:42] <WarchiefGoldva> He's SO LAME
[0:37:47] <Betofall> gottem barret
[0:37:49] <%JailShmixRemix> Thats a good line
[0:38:20] <+doc_ock_rokc> Its awkward but not Cringe
[0:38:25] <ScreamLord> @PlagueOfGripes Cloud feels like if Dante took himself too seriously trying to be cool
[0:38:31] <+radiocrawler> I think that line plays better in Japanese.
[0:38:34] <mizamar> he is actually
[0:38:35] <+doc_ock_rokc> He is insulting cloud
[0:38:51] <ScreamLord> The Dork and the Dweeb
[0:38:53] <+radiocrawler> But awkward due to their personalities.
[0:39:03] <CursedNobleman> re4 leon is my favorite stupid coolguy protagoonist
[0:39:41] <Jrockoni> Barrett is the kind of guy that thinks he has life figured out, but actually has no idea about most things
[0:39:41] <+Neoripo> Oh god, it is the Cuphead guy!
[0:39:50] <ScreamLord> Most Game Journalists don't actually play a lot of games
[0:39:50] <+doc_ock_rokc> Kotaku editor, Chris Kohler
[0:40:05] <KellBeII> too much too quick
[0:40:12] <Trinity5> is plague planning on getting inebriated
[0:40:15] <JohnClaggart> shock troopers
[0:40:17] <Trinity5> or does he not drink
[0:40:23] <KellBeII> he does not drink
[0:40:27] <CursedNobleman> he drinks Potion TM
[0:40:43] <@Nightbot> Plague is a youtube animator and also streams at https://picarto.tv/Plague . Also: t-shirts! http://goo.gl/lze8QO
[0:40:44] <+radiocrawler> I can agree with there being another Sweeper to better acclimate.
[0:41:09] <+radiocrawler> There was only one sweeper in the original before Scorpion that I can remember.
[0:41:21] <Betofall> at one point near the end of the original barret kind of comments that he regrets the terrorism a little bit
[0:41:22] <+doc_ock_rokc> @PlagueOfGripes its Kotaku editor, Chris Kohler who made the complaint. He was complaing because he didn't realize the magic system used MP and thus bruteforced the generator
[0:42:23] <CursedNobleman> Jessie is too much
[0:42:26] <FinchBot> she's all porked
[0:42:29] <KellBeII> great dishonor
[0:42:38] <Good_Snacks> shamfur dispray
[0:42:38] <%JailShmixRemix> Thats exactly how you should act on stream plague, they love it
[0:42:40] <crusader_heide> blow her fucking miIIIIiind Croud-o
[0:42:54] <$jaxondorf> cheer245 you better get the BEST dress to honor your Ancestors. also they know what you do.....
[0:43:39] <superspartaxyZED> cant just tease a story like that
[0:43:42] <JohnClaggart> storytime
[0:43:49] <KellBeII> save the sad stories for art gripes
[0:43:59] <CursedNobleman> @KellBeII fair point
[0:44:08] <%JailShmixRemix> That is how friendships are made :)
[0:44:10] <Betofall> barret is the best cheerleader
[0:44:19] <ufusnake> now you have to tell the story plague
[0:44:25] <crusader_heide> Your ass looks great in those sweat pants Cloud!
[0:44:29] <CursedNobleman> DansGame
[0:44:31] <crusader_heide> Ya know what
[0:44:48] <CursedNobleman> KappaPride
[0:44:56] <+radiocrawler> Barret romance option incoming.
[0:45:09] <crusader_heide> it DOES look good berret sempai
[0:45:17] <CyberDingus> mister T looks upset!
[0:45:27] <BrachyZoid> Cloud..... don't F up
[0:45:40] <+Dresdran> He's always upset.
[0:45:43] <+Gabriel_Wright_Dunn> @BrachyZoid I see what u did thar.
[0:45:44] <TheLPOV> FOXDIIIEEEEEE
[0:45:48] <+Dresdran> Yeah.
[0:45:49] <HyperBomb21> In the OG is a flashing red screen
[0:45:51] <Johnmaddened> I clapped
[0:46:05] <+Dresdran> Who knows?
[0:46:05] <crusader_heide> did they make an advent children game?!
[0:46:07] <TheWe4pon> special lil items
[0:46:12] <TheWe4pon> not much
[0:46:20] <Jrockoni> was sephiroth even associated with wings in the og game?
[0:46:21] <+radiocrawler> Yeahhhh Sephitorth didn’t need to show up this early
[0:46:35] <+Dresdran> Not until his horrible monstrosity.
[0:46:39] <Betofall> i mean his one form at the very end had a wing but thats it
[0:46:45] <kingra> @Jrockoni His final boss form was all wings
[0:46:49] <+Dresdran> You know, where one arm ended in a white wing.
[0:46:55] <+Gabriel_Wright_Dunn> Wow! Who would've thought lighting would hurt a robot?
[0:46:56] <CursedNobleman> in SEs defense, midgar doesnt have a good climactic boss. rufus maybe?
[0:46:59] <JohnClaggart> might wanna heal,eli
[0:47:01] <+AwkwardSnails> His boss music is literally called one wing angel
[0:47:03] <Jrockoni> yeah but all throughout the game he didnt really have a feather motif
[0:47:15] <CursedNobleman> unless they make motor wheel something crazy
[0:47:33] <+radiocrawler> Good job first phase.
[0:47:36] <JohnClaggart> motor wheel will just be the enemy from kirby
[0:48:04] <CursedNobleman> i played planet robobot and it was awesome @JohnClaggart
[0:48:40] <+Dresdran> Got here a little late. Did he use cloud's other stance?
[0:48:46] <mizamar> how come Jessie isn't fighting with them?
[0:48:51] <+doc_ock_rokc> Can you speak in the frozen time?
[0:49:00] <+radiocrawler> That echo effect in frozen time was crazy.
[0:49:02] <BrachyZoid> No wonder he does 10 minute speeches in his 5 seconds of frozen time
[0:49:14] <Trinity5> how you feeling about the music, plauge?
[0:49:15] <+Dresdran> Dio can, so why can't they?
[0:49:15] <CyberDingus> @PlagueOfGripes Eli, don't.
[0:49:17] <Trinity5> plague*
[0:49:20] <+Partialrecall2> psaWrong
[0:49:33] <+doc_ock_rokc> woolieFABRICATION
[0:49:34] <CursedNobleman> the sexual tension in this game is super thicc
[0:49:55] <+Dresdran> Heal the twink.
[0:49:58] <arkv01> yeeee, just in time!
[0:50:05] <+radiocrawler> As long as I switch away, it’s on the AI.
[0:50:06] <arkv01> let the twink eat missiles!
[0:50:37] <arkv01> so is this part any different from the demo?
[0:51:04] <CyberDingus> @PlagueOfGripes PLAGUE, DON'T
[0:51:12] <Trinity5> i mean
[0:51:13] <Trinity5> they will
[0:51:16] <BrachyZoid> Just bros being bros
[0:51:19] <sosuke5> it's a hate/love relationship
[0:51:21] <+doc_ock_rokc> Plague stop making your digital action figures kis
[0:51:25] <CyberDingus> guys you are not helping!
[0:51:30] <+radiocrawler> For science.
[0:51:35] <%JailShmixRemix> For science
[0:51:52] <BrachyZoid> LUL
[0:51:56] <%caramello_man> it kinda echoes in the frozen time
[0:52:05] <Trinity5> now kith
[0:52:25] <BrachyZoid> You mean the demo?
[0:52:31] <CursedNobleman> Guard Scorpion goes BRRRRRRRRR
[0:52:46] <FinchBot> manipulating the ng
[0:52:48] <+third_impact_762> yo ijust downloaded but its shutting down my ps4 or logging me out every time i try to launch, any one know whats up? any suggestions?
[0:52:50] <FinchBot> rng*
[0:53:00] <KitsuneManami> Did he sing the Victory Theme yet?
[0:53:05] <+Dresdran> Yep.
[0:53:12] <KellBeII> yes manami
[0:53:14] <+Dresdran> BA blew his load early.
[0:53:31] <+Dresdran> Probably because the plane isn't in this part.
[0:54:55] <+Dresdran> Noice.
[0:54:55] <Trinity5> naisu
[0:55:00] <%JailShmixRemix> Cinematic Finish
[0:55:04] <CursedNobleman> ASTRAL FINISH
[0:55:08] <BrachyZoid> Never ever
[0:55:17] <+radiocrawler> Not one mistake was made.
[0:55:19] <superspartaxyZED> you dont make mistakes, you make art
[0:55:29] <terminusterminal> Do conditions for cinematic ends differ from boss to boss?
[0:55:32] <+radiocrawler> All as intended.
[0:55:36] <+Dresdran> Its almost a pity this game isn't like the RE2 remake.
[0:55:44] <CursedNobleman> good thing the scorpion didnt destroy the ladders and catwalks
[0:55:53] <KellBeII> does the bomb really matter at that point? the big laser just went right through the wall into the reactor
[0:55:58] <CyberDingus> WHY IS HE INSIDE HIM ?
[0:56:01] <JohnClaggart> it was affected by the explosion i guess
[0:56:05] <CursedNobleman> KappaPride
[0:56:06] <Betofall> yeah life juice was more of a ffx thing
[0:56:13] <+radiocrawler> Wow guys. You need space on that ladder.
[0:56:28] <ScreamLord> @PlagueOfGripes I think that was just from Mako splashing from the explosion
[0:56:36] <+Dresdran> Punisher mode is really good for dodgy types.
[0:56:41] <%JailShmixRemix> The music is very good
[0:56:44] <KingyoNingyo> Go Ploud go
[0:56:45] <ScreamLord> Music seems really good to me
[0:56:52] <JohnClaggart> it's more about them mixing it up from the demo
[0:56:52] <BrachyZoid> Nostalgic babies
[0:56:52] <+radiocrawler> I think the orchestral variation is amazing.
[0:57:06] <cyberblueneon> the music is too orchestral, makes it feel generic, the original had more interesting and varied instrumentation
[0:57:12] <+Necrodancer> The music is good, I wonder what they could have done modernizing the original tracks instead of going orchestral.
[0:58:14] <superspartaxyZED> butt sniff
[0:58:14] <%JailShmixRemix> Oh my cloud
[0:58:15] <JohnClaggart> human centipede
[0:58:23] <BrachyZoid> Get a whiff of that
[0:58:26] <+doc_ock_rokc> @Necrodancer There are more modern remixes
[0:58:27] <CursedNobleman> without permission*
[0:58:27] <%bettysharkface> Crawl up her ass for safety.
[0:58:36] <BrachyZoid> Only consensual clipping
[0:58:43] <Betofall> you only do it after you set the bomb
[0:58:51] <MKUltima> YOOOOOOOOOU
[0:58:52] <+Neoripo> Jesse loved that.
[0:58:57] <extradopeness> Try not to at least
[0:59:13] <KitsuneManami> @PlagueOfGripes did you get Physical or Digital
[0:59:17] <$sleepy_coffee> Unless she consents to it
[0:59:24] <+Gabriel_Wright_Dunn> https://clips.twitch.tv/RelentlessWealthyPistachioPogChamp
[0:59:43] <+radiocrawler> Yeah the overcharge shot feels great in the demo.
[0:59:50] <MrHappyFunshine> I can't help but think of "I like the way you thrust Cloud" any time you use the focused thrust
[0:59:53] <superspartaxyZED> whos up for some intersection?
[1:00:03] <CursedNobleman> the trick is to spike your hair with KY jelly
[1:00:06] <KitsuneManami> Chat, is he playing on Digital or Physical?
[1:00:13] <+doc_ock_rokc> @superspartaxyZED During covid....nah
[1:00:22] <KitsuneManami> I am debating on which. Not sure if I can even FIND it out there since my gamestop is closed.
[1:00:24] <KellBeII> i assume digital
[1:00:41] <CursedNobleman> why physical nowadays, for resale or loaning?
[1:00:48] <%JailShmixRemix> I don't know, people have physical copies already
[1:00:50] <CursedNobleman> digital is so convenient
[1:00:57] <JohnClaggart> hard drive space
[1:01:02] <JohnClaggart> 100 GB file
[1:01:03] <+radiocrawler> Switching characters feels more natural to old school.
[1:01:09] <@Nightbot> Plague is a youtube animator and also streams at https://picarto.tv/Plague . Also: t-shirts! http://goo.gl/lze8QO
[1:01:10] <CursedNobleman> 100GB DansGame
[1:01:10] <+Dresdran> Punisher mode.
[1:01:18] <+Dresdran> All hail it.
[1:01:38] <KitsuneManami> NO
[1:01:40] <CursedNobleman> YESSSSS
[1:01:41] <arkv01> BAD BARRET
[1:01:42] <ScreamLord> NERD
[1:01:45] <superspartaxyZED> hahaha
[1:01:48] <Betofall> i also sing when under stress
[1:01:50] <KitsuneManami> YOU stop telling HIM to stop
[1:01:54] <+Neoripo> He cannot be stopped
[1:01:57] <arkv01> smack him with your big sword
[1:01:57] <+Dresdran> Box debris.
[1:02:02] <arkv01> and tell him naughty boy
[1:02:08] <+Dresdran> The newest invention of Shinra.
[1:02:09] <+Partialrecall2> those are clearly old cpus
[1:02:12] <CursedNobleman> this guy is so stupid and i love it
[1:02:23] <+radiocrawler> Barret didn’t need to sing that twice.
[1:02:27] <CursedNobleman> hes like a doofy voldo LUL
[1:02:32] <+Gabriel_Wright_Dunn> https://clips.twitch.tv/AssiduousClumsyPicklesPrimeMe
[1:02:38] <KitsuneManami> @PlagueOfGripes Physical or Digital?
[1:03:04] <+Dresdran> Twink down.
[1:03:25] <MrHappyFunshine> In the original i always thought those guys were some form of mutant or monster, i guess they are human after all
[1:03:46] <BrachyZoid> All calculated
[1:03:53] <%caramello_man> you didn't die
[1:03:53] <%JailShmixRemix> I am patiently waiting for the moment plague makes many mistakes
[1:03:57] <+radiocrawler> All according to plan.
[1:04:02] <arkv01> ecoterrorists don't make boo boos
[1:04:02] <MKUltima> How much is the remake?
[1:04:07] <JohnClaggart> 60
[1:04:08] <%JailShmixRemix> 60
[1:04:10] <+radiocrawler> It’s for cinematic effect.
[1:04:10] <JohnClaggart> USD
[1:04:14] <KitsuneManami> IT DID
[1:04:31] <KitsuneManami> It was Implied several times that they made it worse on purpose
[1:05:00] <KitsuneManami> right, thought you meant ENTIRELY
[1:05:01] <+radiocrawler> Well they don’t know. They thought they did it.
[1:05:05] <arkv01> finally, someone who speaks SENSE
[1:05:50] <+radiocrawler> Cloud showing off to Jessie here.
[1:06:08] <NireFuster> Of course he is showing off
[1:06:08] <cyberblueneon> on one hand i want to get this game, one the other i find it sad that theres a need for games to get remade as they become techonologically "obsolete". is this going to be considered outdated 10 years from now too?
[1:06:27] <ScreamLord> @PlagueOfGripes I like how your Weapons and Materia appear in cutscenes. I always like it when games do just that little bit more for character customization.
[1:06:37] <+radiocrawler> Ah about Avalanche. I got ya.
[1:06:42] <arkv01> I think these remakes only happen to the most beloved of games, its not like this is a saturated market yet
[1:06:44] <+Spiggerus> 9/11 my prostate daddy
[1:07:01] <+Dresdran> Trust me, this game ain't replacing the old one.
[1:07:03] <+Dresdran> At all.
[1:07:15] <+AwkwardSnails> Where those ghosts at?
[1:07:28] <%JailShmixRemix> I think games get remade to resell them to a newer audience, not because of some obsoleteness
[1:07:29] <Betofall> just think of the planet, think of the planet
[1:07:29] <JohnClaggart> he looks and sounds too much like charlie sheen
[1:07:31] <+radiocrawler> Ok I have to bow out now. Enjoy guys.
[1:07:31] <KitsuneManami> @PlagueOfGripes So in the original did they cause lots of people to die or was it Shinra?
[1:07:40] <KellBeII> "we probably didnt kill EVERYONE in the city
[1:07:46] <arkv01> I mean they are already eyeing each others tushes
[1:07:48] <NireFuster> Would the remake be a good way to experience FF7? I only played Crisis Core and I haven't played OG ff7 yet and I know this remake changes stuff but I don't know how much
[1:07:54] <+Dresdran> NO.
[1:08:00] <arkv01> no harm in getting a touch in every now and then
[1:08:02] <+Dresdran> Play the original.
[1:08:04] <Johnmaddened> LUL
[1:08:16] <+Blurry15> Who voices wedge? Sounds like Jessie Pinkman's friend from Breaking Bad
[1:08:18] <arkv01> I think jessie and biggs definitely fucked at some point
[1:08:21] <ohyouwouldntbelieveme> Piggs
[1:08:24] <JohnClaggart> no, play dirge of cerberus
[1:08:30] <KitsuneManami> @Dresdran I played the original, its just been forever. so enlighten me
[1:08:40] <arkv01> @JohnClaggart you monster ScaredyCat
[1:08:43] <KitsuneManami> all the badly translated Lines
[1:08:43] <+Dresdran> There is a lot of ... changes.
[1:08:45] <Tikigod784> if you beat Cloud in Kingdom Hearts, you are officially the FF7 Master
[1:08:54] <MKUltima> I had the beastiary memorized at one point in middle school
[1:08:55] <Betofall> wow they are really talking up the bomb
[1:09:10] <+Dresdran> Someone was telling some of us about the later parts of the game.
[1:09:24] <+Dresdran> Not going to say what.
[1:09:40] <+Dresdran> Its just that the story ... deviates shall we say.
[1:09:41] <arkv01> @mkultima the WHOLE bestiary, that's goddamn impressive
[1:09:47] <+Neoripo> Shinra reactors are of bad quality
[1:09:59] <HiddenPorpoise> It's not built to code and is falling apart after one little bomb
[1:09:59] <kingra> 👻
[1:10:01] <styx_the_lich> oh shit yo a plague stream thanks recommended channels
[1:10:06] <coldarmracer> is this a full game release or is it in episodes?
[1:10:07] <MKUltima> At least in the Brady Games guide, I read that thing front to back several times
[1:10:12] <Tikigod784> The Remake explains how Cloud gets his bat wing in Olympus Colosseum. Kappa
[1:10:15] <HyperBomb21> In the OG, did they ever mention an assasination attempt on the shinra president?
[1:10:18] <%JailShmixRemix> @coldarmracer full game
[1:10:23] <MKUltima> But it's been years so much of the knowledge is lost now lol
[1:10:27] <arkv01> no, the assassination thing is from before crisis
[1:10:29] <ScreamLord> @PlagueOfGripes I wonder if stuff from Dirge of Cerberus will have any impact on this Remake? Cause despite that game being kinda shit and being a sequel it had a lot of stuff for Vincent
[1:10:32] <red_blaster> The assasination attempt is something from Before Crisis
[1:10:33] <arkv01> lots of retcons from the compilation
[1:10:42] <KitsuneManami> Right in the Original, was this bombing in such a big event? lol
[1:10:53] <arkv01> dirge of cerberus is almost assuredly not being touched because of gackt's copyright on genesis
[1:10:58] <KitsuneManami> i dont even remember the NPCs talking much about the bomb or any destruction
[1:10:59] <arkv01> so unless they just write genesis out of canon
[1:10:59] <ShinobiPhoenix> @hyperbomb21 Compliation stuff
[1:11:02] <JohnClaggart> the answer is yes to the dirge of cerberus stuff
[1:11:04] <TheWe4pon> I thought shinra posted the bomb recipe on the net in the original? purposely making it to big? believe that some one in the tower told you that.
[1:11:04] <+Dresdran> Not for you, if I remember correctly.
[1:11:06] <BrachyZoid> Never played the original, so don't care
[1:11:08] <%JailShmixRemix> Dirge of Cerberus ruined vincent, it needs to stay dead
[1:11:25] <arkv01> I actually liked dirge of cerberus until the genesis epilogue, that shit ruined it
[1:11:32] <MKUltima> Does the Remake negate DoC?
[1:11:38] <MKUltima> Or is it still canon
[1:11:44] <HyperBomb21> Dirge of Cerberus turned Vincent into a literal cuckhold
[1:11:47] <arkv01> LUL
[1:11:48] <CursedNobleman> @KitsuneManami this is much longer compared to the original. this entire game is covered in 5-6 hours in the original
[1:11:48] <KitsuneManami> @PlagueOfGripes What about Angeal? :( he was cool
[1:11:49] <NireFuster> lmao why do people hate Genesis so much
[1:11:50] <JohnClaggart> there was some turks stuff shown that has it canon
[1:11:52] <Betofall> he was clearly there "off sceen"
[1:11:53] <NireFuster> He is kinda annoying though in cc
[1:11:54] <+Dresdran> You'll see eventually, Utlima.
[1:11:57] <arkv01> gackt is fading out of existence as we speak
[1:12:09] <kingra> Gackt was canon and always will be

[1:12:28] <arkv01> b-but zacky poo BibleThump
[1:12:28] <BrachyZoid> But what if this game says it does?
[1:12:30] <CursedNobleman> Gogito Ergo Summa LUL
[1:12:32] <NireFuster> but Zack
[1:12:39] <ScreamLord> DoC had cool ideas but the game part of it sucked
[1:12:40] <KaiserMario> There's a lot of vagueness in the writing of the original, so idk... Maybe they wanted to have this be a plotpoint, but the writing wasn't very clear on it...
[1:12:47] <Betofall> really never liked cloud's reaction at the end of cc, didn't feel the same as the original intended
[1:12:57] <red_blaster> Barrett sounds like a cult leader
[1:13:00] <kuzokai> we will have to see what Nomura thinks about that
[1:13:00] <CursedNobleman> notacult
[1:13:03] <arkv01> damn barret about to go full "we gotta drink the blood of children to take down the gods"
[1:13:08] <Betofall> no he just a terrorist leader
[1:13:14] <HyperBomb21> Barret is charismatic?
[1:13:15] <+Dresdran> Cult of Mr. T.
[1:13:18] <%JailShmixRemix> Barrett has big shoulders
[1:13:21] <ScreamLord> I would like to see them take a crack at Dirge of Cerberus again
[1:13:21] <FinchBot> "your fee-fees..."
[1:13:25] <+doc_ock_rokc> Wedge is the best
[1:13:28] <MKUltima> I'm going to need you to fund my irresponsible chocobo breeding program

[1:13:38] <theamazingroberto> !drops
[1:13:51] <arkv01> god, they really needed to code a restriction against breeding sons with their mothers
[1:14:08] <KitsuneManami> @PlagueOfGripes how was the Original? I barely remember what goes on from Scorpion to Tifa's Bar
[1:14:24] <CursedNobleman> it was good for its time
[1:14:36] <squatting_eagle> Is this the actual game now?
[1:14:39] <CursedNobleman> yep
[1:14:40] <%JailShmixRemix> yes
[1:14:42] <arkv01> original had slapping music and great pre-rendered backgrounds
[1:14:44] <squatting_eagle> sweet
[1:14:47] <NireFuster> the question is, is the og *still* good
[1:14:47] <arkv01> this is a new beast
[1:14:49] <sosuke5> pay me
[1:14:50] <Betofall> barret always has his checkbook
[1:14:55] <squatting_eagle> squatting_eagle subscribed with Twitch Prime. They've subscribed for 11 months! 
[1:14:55] <+wizard_of_diamonds> "Do you think I carry the money with me!?"
[1:14:59] <ScreamLord> Credits?
[1:15:04] <BrachyZoid> We know Cloud is not that smart
[1:15:07] <theloganbrand> He can barely carry things as it is with that gun arm
[1:15:08] <CursedNobleman> @NireFuster id say its still good. i prefer 6 myself, but its good
[1:15:09] <MrHappyFunshine> Nothing happened much until you got to the train area then Shinra troops show up and you jump on a train
[1:15:12] <arkv01> he keeps his cash in the gatling gun compartment for spare clips
[1:15:20] <%JailShmixRemix> Cloud is generally pretty dumb so not too surprising
[1:15:40] <theloganbrand> SIMP
[1:15:40] <arkv01> ohh
[1:15:41] <SuperVaderMan> Thank you for the Health Orb
[1:15:42] <Betofall> materia is fukcing huge apparently
[1:15:47] <KitsuneManami> Its Weird lol
[1:15:49] <VERDAXY> give ger THE D
[1:15:50] <+Dresdran> They shrink, clearly.
[1:15:51] <arkv01> they switched the interaction from barret to jessie
[1:15:57] <KitsuneManami> they Condense prob
[1:16:00] <kingra> It's big because of HER
[1:16:01] <KitsuneManami> they were BIG in the movie
[1:16:02] <ScreamLord> It like a baseball
[1:16:03] <HyperBomb21> The sword slots curve inwards
[1:16:06] <coldarmracer> female armor
[1:16:07] <CursedNobleman> BEGONE THOT
[1:16:07] <+Dresdran> Cloud is a massive dork.
[1:16:12] <+wizard_of_diamonds> What a cutie
[1:16:19] <NireFuster> Jessie stop being such a cutie
[1:16:21] <%squatting_eagle> its pretty
[1:16:23] <CyberDingus> never trust the cute
[1:16:26] <CyberDingus> the cute is EVIL
[1:16:29] <VERDAXY> BBring Her Home and tie her up
[1:16:33] <CursedNobleman> why are the boobie armor cones so pointy. just put her in bikini chainmail
[1:16:35] <arkv01> I suspect they swapped the convo from barret to this
[1:16:44] <arkv01> probably cause barret is supposed to be an asshole still
[1:16:45] <+AwkwardSnails> get ready for the dfm porn
[1:16:48] <+AwkwardSnails> sfm
[1:16:53] <VERDAXY> YES
[1:16:59] <+Dresdran> Always ready.
[1:17:02] <HyperBomb21> I really hope you can get really creative with Materia in this game
[1:17:05] <%JailShmixRemix> Armor with breast pockets is a classic anime trope
[1:17:05] <Shwepie> There's a moment with Jessie later that is just your picture of Leon turning down Ashley. It's unbelievable.
[1:17:05] <CursedNobleman> restore
[1:17:05] <VERDAXY> Hell Yes
[1:17:06] <arkv01> esuna
[1:17:08] <+Dresdran> Like Esuna?
[1:17:08] <Betofall> yes it was seperate
[1:17:10] <+doc_ock_rokc> esuna
[1:17:16] <arkv01> yeah, fuck it eat your poison cloud
[1:17:24] <%JailShmixRemix> yes
[1:17:25] <arkv01> oh yeah it was
[1:17:27] <ScreamLord> @PlagueOfGripes Cleansing Meteria, yeah it's in this
[1:17:27] <arkv01> the skill was esuna
[1:17:34] <MrHappyFunshine> You had cure and restore materia
[1:17:35] <Betofall> restore was bringing back from the dead
[1:17:50] <arkv01> restore was the materia, it had multiple skills
[1:18:23] <Falilth> healing fire materia sounds about right
[1:18:41] <+Dresdran> I do like the idea of materia being used to make magic. Magic crystals are always fun.
[1:18:58] <arkv01> yeah I ain't got time to farm hp boost items, hp up took up half my materia slots
[1:19:41] <ScreamLord> Yes
[1:19:43] <JohnClaggart> from what i saw,from pat, they relegated stats to individual materia
[1:19:47] <+Dresdran> One of the mods Max used replaced that stuff with an option that lets you choose your stats when you level up. Sort of.
[1:19:50] <arkv01> then I watched ff7 speedruns and realized sadness and fury ailments break the game
[1:19:56] <+Dresdran> For the original I mean.
[1:20:12] <HyperBomb21> Plague's stream is a refreshing change of pace for this game, everyone else gushing constantly
[1:20:17] <CursedNobleman> LUL
[1:20:25] <VERDAXY> Let her Ride you
[1:20:26] <arkv01> very dense environs
[1:20:38] <JohnClaggart> UE4 asset store
[1:20:45] <MKUltima> They take their healthcare seriously
[1:20:48] <+Dresdran> I wish.
[1:21:02] <Shwepie> @HyperBomb21 Have you seen Max's stream? It's really bad, but I can understand it.
[1:21:09] <Falilth> RACISM
[1:21:10] <HyperBomb21> yep
[1:21:13] <+Dresdran> How do people feel about a dude carrying a giant sword around?
[1:21:15] <+Dresdran> Wutie.
[1:21:18] <arkv01> max has 20k people in there, what else do you expect?
[1:21:18] <+Dresdran> Wuttie.
[1:21:18] <+XxBTExX> Wutties
[1:21:19] <ScreamLord> Final Fantasy always had this weird aesthetic with scifi, fantasy, and modern
[1:21:22] <EverlastingLich> the wutang clan
[1:21:23] <+thatfig> woots
[1:21:23] <arkv01> wooters
[1:21:24] <KaiserMario> People tend to overestimate game-writing of back then, it was way simpler, and often not fully planned. Things changed during development and devs wouldn't change earlier finished parts to match, also, story aspects often don't match gameplay aspects. Still happens nowadays, but we take notice more often.
[1:21:28] <Jrockoni> wuttie
[1:21:29] <JohnClaggart> woosters
[1:21:30] <+Neoripo> Wutts
[1:21:31] <HyperBomb21> im glad he's liking but the constant hype gets tiring
[1:21:31] <superspartaxyZED> wutter
[1:21:32] <Betofall> woots
[1:21:33] <KingyoNingyo> wutites
[1:21:37] <Huntercd> Wu Tang?
[1:21:43] <arkv01> holy shit this is fucked
[1:21:44] <MKUltima> Wuss? spyCappa_TK
[1:21:45] <ScreamLord> Winks?
[1:21:45] <NireFuster> I love how dialogue just happens and keeps happening even while you walk away
[1:21:51] <Murphio_GS> Real ass
[1:21:52] <arkv01> you can see the repercussions of the bombing
[1:21:56] <+XxBTExX> The Wuttas, and if you want to go full offensive WuttaR with a hard R
[1:22:05] <+butteryfan_> How're you holding up Plague?
[1:22:11] <+wizard_of_diamonds> More, obviusly Kappa
[1:22:11] <+Dresdran> Wujas.
[1:22:14] <arkv01> wugats
[1:22:14] <BrachyZoid> More is always better
[1:22:16] <superspartaxyZED> language is a beautiful thing
[1:22:16] <KingyoNingyo> LOL
[1:22:16] <+Dresdran> Because ninjas.
[1:22:17] <Betofall> only you can stop racism
[1:22:19] <%JailShmixRemix> I don't know
[1:22:19] <MKUltima> Woopsies
[1:22:25] <NireFuster> wake me up inside
[1:22:25] <KingyoNingyo> WAKE ME UP INSIDE
[1:22:28] <+valiard> A camera?
[1:22:30] <sosuke5> SAVE ME
[1:22:33] <Johnmaddened> CAN'T WAKE UP
[1:22:39] <MKUltima> Same from the soldier I've become
[1:22:45] <+Dresdran> Wugrats.
[1:22:52] <MKUltima> Wuggles
[1:22:53] <VERDAXY> stfup Bitch
[1:22:57] <Rodzzila> "But Mr. Streamer told me to say it" Kappa
[1:22:59] <Shwepie> Their racist word would probably be Woolies.
[1:23:05] <KingyoNingyo> Wooloo
[1:23:08] <+Dresdran> Grandma Swamp.
[1:23:16] <KingyoNingyo> it turns out pokemon was the real racist game after all
[1:23:16] <+valiard> When did plague start using a camera?
[1:23:17] <ScreamLord> GoD wOrKs In MyStErIoUs WaYs
[1:23:30] <sosuke5> oh boy
[1:23:32] <%JailShmixRemix> Oh my
[1:23:46] <arkv01> what a nice guy!
[1:23:50] <ScreamLord> Oh no
[1:23:58] <BrachyZoid> NotLikeThis
[1:24:02] <+XxBTExX> Racial slur for people from Wuttai is "Al Bhed"
[1:24:02] <%caramello_man> how helpful of that strange man
[1:24:05] <CyberDingus> Eli you are an anime protagonist !
[1:24:11] <NireFuster> 'I guess this is a thing that is happening to me now'
[1:24:17] <arkv01> hes like OH SHIT WE CAN STILL SAVE UR CAR BRO
[1:24:20] <kuzokai> or a cartoon
[1:24:22] <MKUltima> Plague's the guy we want in a crisis
[1:24:23] <JohnClaggart> not even affected from some strange guy on your isolated farm
[1:24:23] <+Dresdran> Terrible survival instincts.
[1:24:25] <+wizard_of_diamonds> Eli, you are VERY weird.
[1:24:26] <arkv01> save her, plague
[1:24:30] <arkv01> save her from the filth
[1:24:30] <superspartaxyZED> dont say that plague oh dear
[1:24:34] <VERDAXY> yeah your car could of exploded
[1:24:36] <NireFuster> DIRTY LITTLE GIRL OH GOD
[1:24:39] <KingyoNingyo> good job plague, you made the urchins cry
[1:24:41] <$Valdorick> Look at that gross orphan.
[1:24:43] <BrachyZoid> oh come on, chat
[1:24:43] <superspartaxyZED> someone is gonna clip that
[1:24:44] <arkv01> you committed ALL these sins
[1:24:44] <ScreamLord> @PlagueOfGripes People in the slums call people living on the Plates, Platties
[1:24:48] <BrachyZoid> you are the ones thinking about it that way
[1:24:50] <Betofall> cloud just thinking about that pizza run after the pay check
[1:25:02] <KingyoNingyo> it smacks of inefficiency
[1:25:05] <theloganbrand> You gotta maximize planet pumping
[1:25:08] <%caramello_man> there's dumb rope lighting outside the reactor building!
[1:25:10] <MKUltima> The terrible secret of Shinra is that Mako is horribly inefficient
[1:25:12] <JohnClaggart> they were selling it off to other towns
[1:25:15] <Shwepie> Mako is very inefficient at converting to electricity.
[1:25:16] <KellBeII> "why is that dude carrying around a massive sword and wearing a weird military outfit?"
[1:25:19] <Betofall> Always felt like they were being idiotic with the infrastructure
[1:25:19] <MKUltima> It's just dirt cheap
[1:25:21] <Murphio_GS> I panicked when I heard "That's a dirty little girl." especially because I wasn't looking at the screen
[1:25:32] <VERDAXY> Side Boobs
[1:25:33] <+Dresdran> Steal his materia.
[1:25:35] <arkv01> daniel??? PogChamp
[1:25:37] <Johnmaddened> we found him boys
[1:25:41] <kingra> HIS A WIZARD
[1:25:41] <arkv01> steal his wand
[1:25:43] <superspartaxyZED> and boston
[1:25:45] <Betofall> looks like the talk show british man
[1:25:47] <KingyoNingyo> s i d e b o o b
[1:25:48] <sosuke5> and anime man
[1:25:50] <ScreamLord> Some of these people look like they dropped outta Fallout
[1:25:51] <NireFuster> s i d e b o o b
[1:25:52] <+XxBTExX> Its fine, the street sweep looks more out of place
[1:25:58] <arkv01> DIRT
[1:25:59] <BrachyZoid> That's final fantasy for ya
[1:26:01] <KellBeII> "youre a hairy wizard hagrid"
[1:26:02] <+Dresdran> Its a weird pattern.
[1:26:03] <ScreamLord> yes
[1:26:04] <+XxBTExX> Filthy Gilf
[1:26:07] <+wizard_of_diamonds> She has some filth but it's mostly dress
[1:26:13] <KingyoNingyo> judging from her face she's just covered in woolie's fridge contents
[1:26:13] <Betofall> that the nicest/filthiest dess
[1:26:15] <$Valdorick> She might have been in a burning building.
[1:26:16] <+Dresdran> Its a really shitty dress.
[1:26:16] <extradopeness> “Sweep ya street, sir?”
[1:26:24] <MKUltima> She lives in the sewer and just came out like 'Oh-oh no it ruined my dress...'
[1:26:36] <NireFuster> Is no one batting an eye or aknowledging the spiky haired blonde boy with a GIANT SWORD ON HIS BACK AND A SOLDIER OUTFIT
[1:26:43] <Rodzzila> That's Hillary Clinton LUL
[1:26:44] <arkv01> my god, all he death and destruction
[1:26:48] <sosuke5> he, my brother, whom I care for.
[1:26:50] <KaiserMario> What bothers me about this scene is how people are just standing there... No screaming panic, cries, people attempting cpr on some granny, people running around, no looting... just looks too well behaved for what should be chaos...
[1:26:50] <JohnClaggart> you wore it on stream
[1:26:53] <FinchBot> it's weird how all the main characters look so anime but the npcs just look like people
[1:27:01] <ScreamLord> I forgot what they're called
[1:27:10] <+Dresdran> Its like Sonic 06.
[1:27:21] <+Dresdran> You have all the cartoon guys and then regular ass people.
[1:27:32] <$Valdorick> Just get Jessie above the buildings, her Splooshing will put out all the fires.
[1:27:33] <arkv01> unidentified, huh
[1:27:39] <+Gabriel_Wright_Dunn> https://clips.twitch.tv/SmilingSleepyNigiriKappaPride
[1:27:50] <NireFuster> I wonder who could've done it, surely not the dude with a giant sword walking around
[1:28:08] <arkv01> sure pretty lady, I'll evacuate... my balls ScaredyCat
[1:28:16] <SuperVaderMan> Just evacuate 4Head
[1:28:19] <+Dresdran> Who knew megacorps suck as governments?
[1:28:23] <BrachyZoid> Maybe there's a protocol?
[1:28:27] <BrachyZoid> and people already know
[1:28:44] <+Dresdran> Wow.
[1:28:49] <+AwkwardSnails> thanks
[1:28:49] <%caramello_man> ehhhh cloud is just cosplaying, nothing suspicious at all
[1:28:52] <NireFuster> thank you random citizen #24
[1:28:55] <Betofall> mullet boy will always help
[1:29:02] <arkv01> thwank yew mista
[1:29:07] <+Dresdran> I wish there were more weirdoes in the crowd.
[1:29:11] <BrachyZoid> The more you know
[1:29:15] <extradopeness> Holy SHIT it is raining hard af here
[1:29:17] <superspartaxyZED> next were gonna need chest tutorial man
[1:29:23] <+Dresdran> Just make it less weird that Cloud is anime as all hell.
[1:29:25] <NireFuster> NICE PEOPLE ARE DYING
[1:29:31] <KingyoNingyo> haha people go squiiiiiish
[1:29:41] <arkv01> people died so barret could get the biggest nut of his life
[1:29:45] <+Dresdran> They were birthed from the explosion.
[1:29:49] <+Starwarsmike> and then they all died, the end.
[1:29:51] <$Valdorick> Shinra EMTs
[1:29:53] <KingyoNingyo> i bet jessie yells at you
[1:29:53] <Korgororo> I don't know man I fell down stairs one time - they're sly constructions
[1:29:54] <+InkblotBlues> They came from the Shinra holes.
[1:29:56] <ScreamLord> @PlagueOfGripes Everyone thinks AVALANCHE and "Planitologists" are crazy for thinking Mako is the Planet's lifeblood. But do NONE OF THEM notice that the land litterally dries up and dies wherever a Mako Reactor is built?
[1:29:57] <+XxBTExX> Go down and beat them up while they are busy helping
[1:30:05] <NireFuster> NOTHING AT ALL
[1:30:07] <superspartaxyZED> looks like an emergency responder
[1:30:09] <Jrockoni> Do you feel like a hero Cloud?
[1:30:19] <KingyoNingyo> they look like tech goobers
[1:30:24] <kuzokai> say, shouldn't people recognize your outfit
[1:30:25] <superspartaxyZED> they look so helpless lmao
[1:30:28] <arkv01> good guy shinra first responders
[1:30:29] <NireFuster> They're just standing there LMAO
[1:30:32] <+Dresdran> Its like milspec, but people.
[1:30:36] <+Starwarsmike> SHELTER
[1:30:41] <kuzokai> mr.first class soldier
[1:30:44] <arkv01> they're really punching in the "YOU BAD TERRORIST" message
[1:31:01] <BrachyZoid> This would be more impactfull had we not known it was Shinra
[1:31:02] <+XxBTExX> Protip, never live next to a power plant incase some crazy eco terrorists decide to blow it up.
[1:31:04] <MrHappyFunshine> Shinra Community Support Officers, they gotta wait on the real troops to show up to arrest people
[1:31:15] <+Starwarsmike> Gatoraid
[1:31:18] <arkv01> I mean cloud probably wouldn't look too out of place, SOLDIERs would be at disaster scenes
[1:31:39] <NireFuster> I don't think there's *that* many Soldier 1sts on Shinra
[1:31:40] <+Spiggerus> gatoraid of life
[1:31:41] <MKUltima> Booga booga
[1:31:49] <+Dresdran> Harry fucking died.
[1:32:02] <+Starwarsmike> the green Gatorade of life
[1:32:10] <arkv01> I need cloud to say "Imma soulja" at least once in this game
[1:32:15] <+logoth_> yep
[1:32:18] <Korgororo> remember people "video game" pvpSK
[1:32:25] <ScreamLord> @PlagueOfGripes Exactly, even if they don't believe the magic green water is the souls of the dead, everything still dies when it is used up
[1:32:32] <$Valdorick> Danial Radcliff didn't slot HP Materia, so died.
[1:32:34] <+Dresdran> Needs more dumb Yakuza stuff.
[1:32:44] <+Dresdran> Just lean into the strangeness of this world.
[1:33:08] <JohnClaggart> the effects look much better
[1:33:11] <+LordSDB> Hey Plague should we give you a heads up if your heading towards progress or don't say anything at all?
[1:33:16] <arkv01> good ass pyro technicians at squenix
[1:33:17] <KaiserMario> The npcs do look very out of place, some people look straight outta Fallout
[1:33:22] <BrachyZoid> Careful, if you stare at it too long you'll see the loop
[1:33:22] <JohnClaggart> ifrit looks really cool
[1:33:29] <NireFuster> because things collapsing looks cool
[1:33:30] <Korndogg10> remember the jpeg fire from doom LUL
[1:33:31] <+XxBTExX> SquareEnix > Capcom because fire
[1:33:32] <arkv01> DEATH AND DESTRUCTION
[1:33:34] <superspartaxyZED> OOF
[1:33:35] <+logoth_> Oh boy plague you're going to love this part.
[1:33:38] <$Valdorick> Because TERROISM
[1:33:40] <+Dresdran> Its all milspec.
[1:33:40] <HiddenPorpoise> This is basically china
[1:33:41] <theppl> It's super china
[1:33:42] <superspartaxyZED> there go your social credit points
[1:33:44] <KingyoNingyo> flashbacktion!!
[1:33:46] <NireFuster> PTSD
[1:33:50] <+logoth_> Yep
[1:33:52] <+Starwarsmike> didn't design it with 3x the safety factor
[1:33:53] <+XxBTExX> Bishie boy
[1:33:53] <Mexrage> the explosion would probably do the same effect on the entire plate to an earthquake @PlagueOfGripes
[1:33:53] <+logoth_> It gets WORSE
[1:33:53] <$Valdorick> Its Shinra, you think they PAY for GOOD buidlings?
[1:33:56] <$Valdorick> Perfab that shit.
[1:33:57] <Betofall> yeah sure lets show this now i guess
[1:34:02] <KaiserMario> The fire looks better than RE3, but the people look better in RE3, so... even stevens?
[1:34:02] <+Spiggerus> the edge lord himself
[1:34:05] <Johnmaddened> it's the villain I recognize! I clapped!
[1:34:05] <BrachyZoid> Wow they don't give a shit about keeping secrets in this
[1:34:09] <extradopeness> Wow, really?
[1:34:10] <Sokumotanaka> @PlagueOfGripes No wutai is china plague
[1:34:11] <arkv01> not too soon for the seph simps
[1:34:12] <NireFuster> OH NO HE'S HOT
[1:34:13] <%JailShmixRemix> Oh my
[1:34:14] <CursedNobleman> shin-ra uses the kanji for god and silk/net
[1:34:15] <+Dresdran> I'm pretty sure the Imperium of Man has better construction.
[1:34:17] <Jrockoni> you think the city run by the electric company gives a shit about "up to code"
[1:34:21] <+Neoripo> Plate is unstable, so maybe the supports of the bridge failed
[1:34:22] <FinchBot> so pretty
[1:34:23] <KingyoNingyo> cloud are you okay
[1:34:25] <Betofall> forget building up to this guy, just dump him in
[1:34:26] <CursedNobleman> so shinra captures the essence of the gods, mako
[1:34:32] <impartialcredit> such a strut
[1:34:32] <extradopeness> Is he going to speak
[1:34:37] <arkv01> but den... who was phone?
[1:34:40] <+Dresdran> Like, they don't care about people but you fuck with their buildings and you will pay.
[1:34:40] <theppl> Imperium of man puts Skulls everywhere
[1:34:41] <Murphio_GS> The og bishi villain antagonist
[1:34:42] <KingyoNingyo> hey cloud maybe don't stand under the shitty bridge
[1:34:44] <superspartaxyZED> also your leg is broke?
[1:34:47] <theppl> So you know they are good
[1:34:56] <KaiserMario> nippleheim
[1:35:00] <NireFuster> Nice reflexes Cloud, a man stood behind you and you let him get away because you just stood there and did nothing
[1:35:03] <arkv01> we're establishing real early cloud is mentally unstable
[1:35:16] <theppl> Wait is this the beginning?
[1:35:19] <+Neoripo> Likr Dtsmp!
[1:35:22] <+XxBTExX> Its fine if they go back to it later.
[1:35:30] <+Neoripo> Like Stamp!
[1:35:31] <Artista_AF> i think that's the idea 🤔
[1:35:33] <+Dresdran> Your camera has stopped.
[1:35:36] <superspartaxyZED> yeah im pretty confused
[1:35:37] <+Dresdran> Or is it me?
[1:35:40] <$Valdorick> To be fair, that happens with Sephiroth at the end of Midgard in the original too.
[1:35:41] <+XxBTExX> but its going to be weird when you dont get into Nibelheim until like way later
[1:35:41] <VeryTricky> well im confused
[1:35:44] <JohnClaggart> it's you
[1:35:46] <Clowns> it's moving.
[1:35:46] <ufusnake> it is weird
[1:35:49] <Korgororo> plenty of games do this kind of stuff though ?
[1:35:50] <NireFuster> I only played Crisis Core but I'm still confused
[1:35:54] <theppl> Flashback
[1:35:54] <+logoth_> On the boat?
[1:35:54] <RykerSkies> kalm?
[1:35:55] <JohnClaggart> refresh, theres some drops
[1:35:56] <arkv01> kalm?
[1:35:57] <Korgororo> or am I crazy
[1:35:57] <Betofall> on the boat
[1:35:58] <+logoth_> Oh yeah the flashback
[1:36:00] <+Dresdran> My Internet was being shit.
[1:36:02] <arkv01> yeah kalm it is
[1:36:02] <+XxBTExX> you see him in Costa Azur or something
[1:36:03] <Johnmaddened> Kalm Flashback, I think
[1:36:05] <SleepyMaribo> the flashback once you reach Calm
[1:36:06] <$Valdorick> When he flies out of Shina's Office?
[1:36:07] <+logoth_> He's mentioned at Shinra tower too
[1:36:08] <garekerag> Well, just think: if they're doing all this this early, maybe they've got something ELSE in mind for later...
[1:36:10] <MrHappyFunshine> The flashback when you get to the town outside Midgar
[1:36:10] <+Neoripo> In the Shinra building you see him
[1:36:11] <Rodzzila> I never played the original and have no fucking idea what is going on LUL
[1:36:13] <Sokumotanaka> I think he shows up during the breakout of shinra
[1:36:14] <Tikigod784> the first thing you see is the sword lol
[1:36:15] <extradopeness> Yeah seph is mentioned in passing In a conversation like just barely after this
[1:36:21] <Betofall> technically when you flashback about nibelheim the first time
[1:36:25] <tolloponik> I remember they build him up for the entirety of this part of the game
[1:36:35] <impartialcredit> what is he, your museum guide?
[1:36:36] <cyberblueneon> i could do without these slow walking sequences in games
[1:36:38] <NireFuster> This is too weird because they're making it just way too obvious that Cloud is hallucinating and shit
[1:36:43] <theppl> I'm confused
[1:36:44] <FinchBot> i've only played the very beginning of the original, but this seems.. odd
[1:36:49] <NireFuster> It's like beating you over the head with it
[1:36:51] <ScreamLord> It does help nail in the point that Cloud is kinda crazy, though
[1:36:58] <Artista_AF> also i think the implication is that the Midgard citizens have been living ignorant of the outer world for so long they have no way to knowing where Mako comes from
[1:36:58] <+logoth_> Im glad Im not the only one who thought this
[1:37:02] <KaiserMario> In terms of writing, it's not something you should do ever
[1:37:06] <theppl> Should I stop watching Plague?
[1:37:10] <extradopeness> Is he
[1:37:14] <deligador> Number `15.
[1:37:15] <theppl> I feel left out
[1:37:17] <extradopeness> AFUCK OFF
[1:37:21] <+logoth_> This is going to go on for awhile
[1:37:28] <Betofall> now im angry
[1:37:29] <$Valdorick> Noramua blasting his load all over your and FF7's chest.
[1:37:30] <vonmaultke> Its stupid how this game spoils its own plot twist
[1:37:31] <terminusterminal> Sephiroth is a part of AVALANCHE now too
[1:37:34] <superspartaxyZED> cloud is sweating pretty hard here
[1:37:37] <+wizard_of_diamonds> I have zero investment in this cutscene
[1:37:40] <arkv01> do the thing poochie!
[1:37:40] <garekerag> it's not really THAT confusing; they're establishing that Cloud's got a bit of brainwrong early, instead of dumping it on you later
[1:37:47] <BrachyZoid> Yeah this is too soon
[1:37:49] <HyperBomb21> I imagine that, for people who don't know the OG, they'll assume that cvloud has some kind of PTSD and this weird black soat man kille dhis mother
[1:37:49] <Johnmaddened> wow they're just putting it all out there
[1:37:54] <HyperBomb21> Thats how they're setting it up
[1:37:54] <+Dresdran> we need more time to establish Cloud as a character.
[1:37:55] <BrachyZoid> I give no shits about these characters
[1:37:57] <arkv01> her flesh?
[1:37:58] <+FunkyRot> yes
[1:38:05] <JohnClaggart> it's fine
[1:38:07] <arkv01> the fuck does jenova want to spare cloud for?
[1:38:08] <JohnClaggart> dont think about it
[1:38:14] <extradopeness> God damn he is SO poochie rn
[1:38:20] <MKUltima> I'm going out on a limb and guessing they front loaded part 1 with all this backstory because they weren't sure about the subsequent portions being greenlit or not
[1:38:21] <KaiserMario> It's so clear they are doing this just to satisfy fan thirst
[1:38:22] <NireFuster> AND NEVER COME BCK
[1:38:24] <+Dresdran> You can tell things about a character early on, but it should be the character who says it.
[1:38:24] <VERDAXY> wheres zack Fair?
[1:38:29] <+logoth_> just keepp talkinggg likee thiss keeepp going more ddialoggg moooree moreee moreee
[1:38:31] <VERDAXY> ZACK SAVE US
[1:38:40] <FinchBot> no baseline has been established, so none of means anything
[1:38:42] <extradopeness> Shut up shut up SHUT UP!
[1:38:48] <NireFuster> Is he pulling an Itachi move right now???
[1:38:49] <+logoth_> This isn't a remake of FF7, it's the sequel to Crisis Core.
[1:38:49] <%JailShmixRemix> IT WAS ALL A DREAM
[1:38:50] <arkv01> no homo but after that scene I wanna bang seph
[1:38:51] <doggieo> ITACHI
[1:38:52] <BrachyZoid> ITACHIIIIIIIII
[1:38:53] <Josshoo> He was being duplicitous! It was all a ruse!
[1:38:55] <ScreamLord> Itachi? Is that you?
[1:38:56] <Jrockoni> hes full on advent children sephiroth from the start now
[1:39:00] <Rodzzila> My girl ones try to explain me who or what the fuck Sephiroth is and was the most confusing thing ever LUL
[1:39:02] <KingyoNingyo> ITACHI ;_;
[1:39:03] <%JailShmixRemix> LMFAO
[1:39:05] <Johnmaddened> LUL
[1:39:07] <theppl> Why is Tifa's boobs being big important to story?
[1:39:08] <impartialcredit> crazy equals character depth
[1:39:11] <SuperVaderMan> Must be my imagination :)
[1:39:23] <extradopeness> LUL
[1:39:26] <+Neoripo> He was talking about Clouds mother begging Sephi to not kill his son
[1:39:40] <Korgororo> bitchin' time pvpFATTERZ
[1:39:40] <NireFuster> 'Huh... must be my imagination...'
[1:39:40] <HyperBomb21> &
[1:39:46] <arkv01> when you think about it, this remake is basically an otome game where you self insert as tifa to engineer the death of your rival and pin it on sephiroth
[1:39:49] <CyberDingus> @theppl life is hard, but titty is soft. Big titty if softer titty. Big titty is better titty.
[1:39:50] <arkv01> and then bang sephiroth too
[1:40:00] <HyperBomb21> @Neoripo Yeah, that seems to be how they're selling it to new players
[1:40:04] <theppl> @CyberDingus thx brah
[1:40:13] <garekerag> wait is that just a theory, i thought that was established
[1:40:23] <Tikigod784> yeah, jenova is the real villain
[1:40:27] <kingra> This was already established
[1:40:30] <Tikigod784> sephie dead
[1:40:35] <arkv01> I thought the guy at shinra HQ was just one of the men in cloaks?
[1:40:39] <@Nightbot> Plague is a youtube animator and also streams at https://picarto.tv/Plague . Also: t-shirts! http://goo.gl/lze8QO
[1:40:44] <HyperBomb21> For new players, this is probably Kingdom Hearts tier anime nonsense. If its enjoyable, they might like it
[1:40:51] <+XxBTExX> Sephiroth was a pretty weak villain. Kefka was way better.
[1:41:05] <ScreamLord> Jenova looks like it could be basically The Thing
[1:41:06] <+Dresdran> Jenova is a horrible monstrosity.
[1:41:12] <Tikigod784> tHe DaRkNeSs In ClOuD's HeArT
[1:41:15] <garekerag> it's EXTREMELY anime, dropping this weird stuff right off the bat, but any given netflix series is weirder
[1:41:31] <Tikigod784> jenova is literally the thing
[1:41:34] <graemecrackers2> Nice
[1:41:39] <CursedNobleman> kronenburgs?
[1:41:40] <Mexrage> unlike the thing, she is also a hive mind of every part of it
[1:41:43] <Tikigod784> Did Squeenix rip off John Carpenter?
[1:41:50] <heroicspiritavenger> And is a Sinspawn from FFX
[1:41:50] <garekerag> MORTY! CLOUD'S A CRONENBERG, MORTY
[1:41:57] <ScreamLord> @CursedNobleman Horrible, mangled, flesh monsters
[1:42:09] <deligador> I love it.
[1:42:12] <arkv01> jenova's very cells eventually take control of its parasitized hosts
[1:42:13] <CursedNobleman> @ScreamLord ah, rick and morty term
[1:42:24] <theppl> Look at all these norms!
[1:42:46] <graemecrackers2> Tom Six looking guy
[1:42:53] <arkv01> seph had an ego and will, but he broke down after the revelation of his lineage
[1:42:56] <+logoth_> Look at these FF15 NPcs
[1:42:56] <garekerag> it's the name of a director, david cronenberg, who does movies like that
[1:42:58] <ScreamLord> @CursedNobleman Well it predates Rick & Morty but yeah. Basically
[1:43:06] <HyperBomb21> Wasnt Cloud exposed to Jenova cells?
[1:43:29] <Tikigod784> Sephiroth got hyped up post-game because people wrote fanfic about him
[1:43:31] <JohnClaggart> he was exposed to a mako reaction
[1:43:32] <+logoth_> He's practically a mascot at this point
[1:43:38] <Sokumotanaka> You right plague preach
[1:43:40] <+XxBTExX> He cute though so hes super popular
[1:43:41] <Korgororo> the darkness in clouds heart pvpSK
[1:43:41] <heroicspiritavenger> Honestly I like the idea on how in a lot of animal species, the child consumes the Parent. So I always assumed after awhile Sephiroth subsumed Jenova as an entity.
[1:43:41] <MrHappyFunshine> Yeah Cloud was infused with Jenova cells, it is the reason he is super human
[1:43:49] <NireFuster> Sephiroth in Crisis Core was actually a really cool character and I enjoyed him a lot
[1:43:53] <ScreamLord> @HyperBomb21 Yeah, the plot of Advent Children revolved around the slowly killing Cloud
[1:43:53] <arkv01> apparently geostigma was the remnant sof jenova cells and they got cured in AC
[1:43:56] <kingra> Sephiroth died like a bitch in the original game
[1:43:57] <Tikigod784> And then anime subsumed Sephiroth
[1:44:00] <$jobbedbone> If you make your character too cool, your fans will ruin them.
[1:44:13] <+Dresdran> Sephie is a victim.
[1:44:15] <arkv01> but sephiroth is a villain that SELLS
[1:44:15] <Mexrage> the true villain is Hojo
[1:44:16] <+Neoripo> TBH That is just Cloud's memory of how Sephiroth was
[1:44:16] <Tikigod784> but then Disney subsumed anime
[1:44:34] <+Neoripo> Hojo is the true villain
[1:44:43] <+XxBTExX> That Lucretia + Hojo doujinshi though with NTR
[1:44:47] <arkv01> I imagine the gender ratio for people buying this game might even be tipped more towards women thanks to bish king
[1:44:50] <MKUltima> What was that term you used for what jenova turns people into again?
[1:44:52] <KaiserMario> @PlagueOfGripes Wasn't Seph supposed to be a "fallen angel". He was a hero who fell from grace and becomes a evil lord, like a "satan"?
[1:44:58] <MrHappyFunshine> Sephiroth before the breakdown was a goofball that hated Hojo and his own celebrity.
[1:45:02] <arkv01> @MKUltima poochies
[1:45:02] <Korgororo> sephiroth's background is a doujin LUL
[1:45:06] <heroicspiritavenger> The truest villain is Nomura, who believes if someone criticizes you that you should go twice as hard on whatever they criticized
[1:45:08] <JohnClaggart> chronenbergs
[1:45:09] <Tikigod784> I mean to be fair, he's a superhuman who dominated a war
[1:45:25] <jbrachob> basically homelander from the boys
[1:45:27] <GenericTwitchAcc1> monkaS Homelander?
[1:45:28] <Apolonm> Homelander?
[1:45:29] <Sokumotanaka> God play sadness and sorrow
[1:45:29] <+XxBTExX> @Korgororo the NTR was real
[1:45:30] <CursedNobleman> i wouldnt mind being spawn of uncle amazon
[1:45:30] <NireFuster> @heroicspiritavenger I always found extremely pathetic that Nomura does that
[1:45:37] <arkv01> I mean before his revelation, he was a nice enough guy
[1:45:40] <Tikigod784> That's why the Gackt thing kinda worked. Not even elite soldiers could touch him
[1:45:42] <Rodzzila> reminds me of "The Boys" bad guy, can't remember the name
[1:45:43] <arkv01> especially in crisis core
[1:45:45] <arkv01> he was cool
[1:45:47] <HyperBomb21> Very true
[1:45:52] <heroicspiritavenger> @nirefuster it’s chuunibyou shit
[1:45:52] <NireFuster> Sephi was really cool in CC
[1:45:56] <Korgororo> @xxbtexx too real NotLikeThis
[1:45:56] <cahv123> I was wondering if someone was going to connect this to The Boyz. It's what I thought first too.
[1:45:57] <arkv01> gackt was the real crazy
[1:45:59] <MKUltima> @JohnClaggart Danke
[1:46:28] <KaiserMario> Plague's super right, again
[1:46:34] <Shwepie> Sorry Plague, Nomura only knows 2-dimensional characters. Maybe.
[1:46:38] <Sokumotanaka> AGREED
[1:46:40] <garekerag> to be fair "bioweapon" was basically also kefka's background
[1:46:46] <CursedNobleman> this is why i listen to plague. he turns my dumb childhood bullshit into something less dumb and shitty
[1:46:49] <arkv01> I think the game is assuming a certain degree of familiarity with the original plot
[1:46:51] <extradopeness> psaBig facts
[1:46:51] <atgithursdays> The only thing I can ask is Are you seeing through rose tinted glasses?
[1:47:00] <arkv01> like you see sephiroth and you think, aha, darkness my old friend
[1:47:02] <vonmaultke> So the writer has no idea about the original story outside the broad strokes and went full anime?
[1:47:16] <NireFuster> are we assuming that the writers are making sephi a moustache twirling villain based on that hallucination?
[1:47:17] <+Dresdran> Probably.
[1:47:17] <jbrachob> Sephie was just too pretty and everyone over looked everything else about him because OMG HE SO CUTE/SEXY/COOL
[1:47:20] <Tikigod784> In hindsight though, what the heck is Cloud at this point, since he takes out Sephiroth at the end.
[1:47:27] <SuperVaderMan> hello homeless children, it is me, the protagonist
[1:47:28] <$jobbedbone> deep v spyYum
[1:47:31] <+XxBTExX> they have been building him more and more if every extra appearance
[1:47:32] <NireFuster> cause that's probably cloud's memories and shit
[1:47:41] <GenericTwitchAcc1> PogChamp beat up the urchins for nickels
[1:47:57] <heroicspiritavenger> @vonmaultke I think Nojima is the reason for some of the issues spawned by the Compilation and Flanderization of characters
[1:48:04] <Tikigod784> The lack of details made Sephiroth work better as an antagonist.
[1:48:21] <Korgororo> someone with awareness of their biases - so sexy pvpFATTERZ
[1:48:25] <arkv01> I mean yeah it's anime, but it's still gonna get a ton of people gushing to see seph this early
[1:48:26] <+logoth_> What I feel a lot about this game so far is that they did things just because they COULD
[1:48:30] <atgithursdays> Critique the game as you will, I'm a young person who didn't play the original
[1:48:30] <Jrockoni> @tikigod784 cloud got the jump on sephiroth. that's why he killed him.
[1:48:34] <HyperBomb21> I'm not gonna hate until i finish the game for myself
[1:48:39] <+XxBTExX> The real villan were the friends we made along the way.
[1:48:40] <HyperBomb21> I'm giving this game its fair chance
[1:48:41] <$jobbedbone> I wonder how much of sephiroth came from that early murder mystery draft we hear about
[1:48:44] <ScreamLord> @PlagueOfGripes I know that Cloud was never actually a SOLIDER but isn't he basically the same thing since he was exposed to Jenova Cells and Mako?
[1:48:44] <KaiserMario> @PlagueOfGripes Would it be better if in the fashback, Sephiroyth was just a shadow, like it's Cloud's image of him, and not really him?
[1:48:44] <+AwkwardSnails> The ghosts haven't even shown up yet
[1:48:48] <+logoth_> Just shove more scenes in, shove it in, put that in, put this in add in more dialog more more more
[1:48:49] <atgithursdays> I just am wondering, as someone who didn't play the original, if this will keep the same "feel"
[1:48:49] <deligador> LUL
[1:48:52] <heroicspiritavenger> There’s also the argument the original vanilla FF7 was good was because Sakaguchi was around to reign people the fuck in
[1:49:00] <Tikigod784> not in the flashback @Jrockoni , I meant like post-game/Advent Children Cloud is pretty crazy
[1:49:02] <MKUltima> Lucky him being injected with Jenova cells and being exposed to Mako. I was only ever injected with the cells of a Jehova's Witness and then held in front of a microwave with the door window broken
[1:49:04] <HyperBomb21> So far though, the game is pretty tight.
[1:49:13] <JohnClaggart> that girl in the corner's skirt is super short
[1:49:14] <HyperBomb21> once you get the hang of the combat, it gets exciting
[1:49:16] <+XxBTExX> Whenever there is a huge fire you can expect people to go to the roof and watch that shit burn out.
[1:49:17] <SuperVaderMan> mummy, our toys though
[1:49:19] <NireFuster> YOUR TOYS ARE DESTROYED
[1:49:24] <Shwepie> What if some of the character direction is taking inspiration from Namura's Kingdom Hearts characterizations?
[1:49:24] <GenericTwitchAcc1> Wowee
[1:49:25] <graemecrackers2> I hear plague lives in a swamp
[1:49:43] <ScreamLord> @PlagueOfGripes I know that Cloud was never actually a SOLIDER but isn't he basically the same thing since he was exposed to Jenova Cells and Mako?
[1:49:44] <BrachyZoid> What do you mean?
[1:49:45] <Solokaldaka> isn't sephoroth at this point just cloud having jenova hallucinations anyway?
[1:49:46] <+logoth_> The station? go in the only direction you can go in
[1:49:48] <Major_monotone> Hello Eli and chat! How are we doing tonight?
[1:49:58] <JohnClaggart> the ladders are usually chained
[1:49:59] <+logoth_> Sometimes
[1:50:00] <vonmaultke> No
[1:50:01] <Jrockoni> @tikigod784 yeah but then he wss busted because of his mutations
[1:50:05] <$sleepy_coffee> Everyone sharing their farts while ya country people must venture far to share our farts
[1:50:05] <Sokumotanaka> Rarely
[1:50:06] <JohnClaggart> but you can just jump up to them
[1:50:07] <HiddenPorpoise> They only open down
[1:50:10] <+wizard_of_diamonds> Yeah you can't just access them
[1:50:12] <+XxBTExX> Depends on what city you live in.
[1:50:13] <+logoth_> Its usually sealed in some way
[1:50:16] <+wizard_of_diamonds> easily
[1:50:16] <heroicspiritavenger> @shwepie I dunno, the whole point of this remake seems a lot to be aligning it with things from AC and the spinoffs
[1:50:22] <+Starwarsmike> can't access them fron the ground
[1:50:31] <Tikigod784> Cloud was left to soak in a spicy Mako soup for like 6 years or something lol
[1:50:35] <+Dresdran> Would certainly explain Yakuza.
[1:50:37] <CursedNobleman> theyre everywhere and easy to use, but not so easy to access
[1:50:38] <fruit_pie_the_magician> This is Shinra we're talking about
[1:50:38] <+XxBTExX> In Japan is common to go on the roof and jump off.
[1:50:39] <terminusterminal> People in Japan jump of buildings
[1:50:39] <BrachyZoid> Japanese schools love the roofs
[1:50:47] <cyberblueneon> does japan have fire escapes
[1:50:48] <+Dresdran> You could easily get on the roofs of buildings.
[1:50:52] <Tikigod784> You gotta let your Cloud soup simmer a bit before you get to the endgame
[1:50:54] <Artista_AF> it depends on the building, but yeah that type of Fire stairs are for going down, not up
[1:50:56] <CursedNobleman> fire codes are strict and great for america! :(
[1:50:59] <Tikigod784> 'wait why is Patrick Stewart in this game
[1:51:01] <Korgororo> professor X?
[1:51:04] <+wizard_of_diamonds> There's some real sharp dressed characters in this scene
[1:51:06] <NireFuster> Don't roofs in japan have like fences and shit to make people not able to jump anymore?
[1:51:12] <+AwkwardSnails> its harry again
[1:51:14] <Sokumotanaka> Is that professor Xavier?
[1:51:17] <ScreamLord> Apparently despite the common anime trop of students hanging out on school roofs that is actually super illegal and rarely ever done
[1:51:17] <%Samex_Comex> Whoa fancy layout
[1:51:26] <+Dresdran> "Numba One, I'm trapped on the anime planet. Beam me up for the love of all that is good."
[1:51:33] <NireFuster> Yeah you can get in trouble if you hang out in roofs mostly in schools I've heard
[1:51:45] <+wizard_of_diamonds> LUL
[1:51:47] <Rodzzila> Here building don't even have fire stairs LUL
[1:51:48] <$sleepy_coffee> Over in Alaska we don’t have many large buildings that need fire escapes, we have elevators and stair access tho
[1:51:50] <GenericTwitchAcc1> LUL ok Lex Jone
[1:51:50] <heroicspiritavenger> @screamlord even in anime if you pay attention they make a point to saying the roof is off limits
[1:51:57] <CursedNobleman> LUL
[1:52:01] <+Starwarsmike> oh boy
[1:52:04] <heroicspiritavenger> And characters hanging out there don’t give a fuck and do it anyway
[1:52:04] <Artista_AF> from what i heard, yeah Roofs in Japan are now a massive restricted area due to the high suicide rate

[1:55:17] <JohnClaggart> him being able to see them doesnt make sense either

[1:55:18] <+wizard_of_diamonds> Zoinks Scoob
[1:55:20] <Shwepie> They way the ghosts are modeled really bugs me. They's supposed to be cloth like, but are very solid like they are flesh like.
[1:55:22] <+Dresdran> ITS THE FANS!
[1:55:24] <JohnClaggart> she grabs his gloved hands

[1:55:41] <+gutsmcbutts> right about what?
[1:55:41] <ScreamLord> @PlagueOfGripes Nothing can fix Final Fantasy plot contrivances
[1:55:45] <kingra> NOT CANON NYHAHAHA
[1:55:45] <extradopeness> The canon police are here!
[1:55:48] <KaiserMario> Sora! You need to fight the Darkness, so the Heartless can be saved!
[1:55:49] <Korgororo> LUL
[1:55:49] <jbrachob> PEACE
[1:55:49] <HyperBomb21> Yep
[1:55:50] <NireFuster> She's off to be drunk somewhere else
[1:55:50] <graemecrackers2> I hope we see Vincent
[1:55:50] <+wizard_of_diamonds> See ya later fuckers LUL
[1:55:53] <GenericTwitchAcc1> very phallic ghosts, if I do say so myself
[1:55:54] <HyperBomb21> The ghosts are the fanbase
[1:55:54] <gordieda20> BYE LUL
[1:55:54] <SuperVaderMan> I'm leaving, and I'm taking my ghost friends with me
[1:56:01] <BrachyZoid> No, that would be smart
[1:56:05] <Betofall> Running from your demons
[1:56:06] <Explodincatz> she gave him the Ghost virus
[1:56:06] <heroicspiritavenger> Can’t blame her lol
[1:56:07] <+logoth_> Im taking my ghosts and GOING HOME >:(
[1:56:10] <@dcn2049> that scene was close to being word salad
[1:56:14] <$sleepy_coffee> Now the one ghosts have time assault rifles
[1:56:16] <NireFuster> It's so fucking dumb these guys could've gunned down Cloud so easily
[1:56:18] <NireFuster> But they just stand there
[1:56:19] <extradopeness> #
[1:56:20] <%bettysharkface> That entire cutscene felt like I was having a stroke.
[1:56:23] <extradopeness> Tuuune
[1:56:25] <@dcn2049> haha yeah
[1:56:33] <+Dresdran> It would have been fun if they made this game more like the Yakuza series.
[1:56:36] <CursedNobleman> i dunno, if aerith has all this ghost nonsense i dont know if the canon this happens to aerith
[1:56:38] <heroicspiritavenger> @nirefuster maybe they want to take him for questioning
[1:56:44] <MrHappyFunshine> I feel very upset right now but also amused
[1:56:45] <CursedNobleman> canon thing*
[1:56:50] <@dcn2049> It was like two chat bots were nearly making sense, but not quite
[1:56:54] <GenericTwitchAcc1> Wowee 🔫
[1:56:56] <Sokumotanaka> Play dead
[1:56:57] <deligador> They are just looped. Kappa
[1:56:59] <NireFuster> Maybe maybe
[1:57:00] <garekerag> fun fact for FF fans: Cloud is a Dark Knight (DRK), which is why he swings around a big piece of metal AND is an angsty boi with brain issues
[1:57:12] <+wizard_of_diamonds> LUL
[1:57:15] <+logoth_> 8 damage
[1:57:17] <+logoth_> he'd be fucking dead
[1:57:19] <+wizard_of_diamonds> How playful Kappa
[1:57:23] <CursedNobleman> @garekerag whats that from? Gafgarion can kick his ass
[1:57:25] <NireFuster> Haha playful puppy!
[1:57:27] <@dcn2049> Cloud is a pizza cutter, because he's all edge with no point
[1:57:30] <%Samex_Comex> Shake it off Cloud
[1:57:36] <heroicspiritavenger> @garekerag is that why his DMG is shitty because he’s a tank?
[1:57:36] <ScreamLord> @PlagueOfGripes Those dogs look more like mutated black panthers
[1:57:40] <GenericTwitchAcc1> get fucked nerd
[1:57:41] <NireFuster> 'no big deal' *throat bleeding out*
[1:57:47] <extradopeness> Not the puppos
[1:57:57] <$sleepy_coffee> Gosh dang cat dogs
[1:58:00] <extradopeness> The pupperinos
[1:58:08] <+Dresdran> Its D&D rules. If you are melee and aren't a rogue you are the aggro sponge.
[1:58:15] <JohnClaggart> is ds9 on prime though?
[1:58:30] <+Dresdran> DS9 is on Prime and Netflix.
[1:58:37] <@dcn2049> too bad babylon 5 isn't anymore
[1:58:41] <arkv01> foolisness, cloud
[1:58:45] <+gutsmcbutts> you had your fun, now back to the intended path, plague
[1:58:48] <garekerag> Is B5 on anything? B5 rules
[1:58:51] <arkv01> oh sick, DS9 is on prime!
[1:58:58] <Sokumotanaka> No their displacer beast
[1:59:05] <Korgororo> ^
[1:59:08] <+Dresdran> My dad still has the box set for B5.
[1:59:09] <superspartaxyZED> too much water is better than too little water
[1:59:18] <NireFuster> Do you think 8-4 means crazy bastard with giant sword
[1:59:20] <extradopeness> Drink MORE water
[1:59:26] <Coystick> Shinra's finest
[1:59:27] <@dcn2049> It was
[1:59:29] <@dcn2049> It no longer is
[1:59:31] <heroicspiritavenger> Has anyone told you @plagueofgripes that their image of what you looked like was different in their head based off your voice alone?
[1:59:34] <+wizard_of_diamonds> I think you missed a drop?
[1:59:44] <+Dresdran> HP Up.
[1:59:45] <+Neoripo> HP up
[1:59:45] <+Spiggerus> hp up
[1:59:47] <+azure22900> HP up
[1:59:47] <JohnClaggart> it was the hp up
[1:59:53] <garekerag> hp up?
[1:59:56] <KaiserMario> Materia
[2:00:01] <CyberDingus> Somebody please remind me why BULLETS don't kill this guy.
[2:00:04] <+azure22900> Not very useful tbh with only 2 slots
[2:00:12] <deligador> HP up, HP up inside.
[2:00:14] <heroicspiritavenger> @cyberdingus Jenova cells
[2:00:17] <garekerag> Cyberdingus: he's a tank, proof
[2:00:17] <NireFuster> @CyberDingus because vidyagame!!
[2:00:23] <NireFuster> It did kill the *other* guy tho lul
[2:00:29] <ShinobiPhoenix> @cyberdingus RPG rules
[2:00:49] <JohnClaggart> it's 1 per enemy i think
[2:00:54] <Sokumotanaka> @CyberDingus Because cloud has a uno card that says "no u" in his pocket that doesn't allow bullets to kill him
[2:00:54] <JohnClaggart> at least in the beginning
[2:00:55] <NireFuster> these previews remind me of DMC4's previews for skills
[2:00:56] <+Dresdran> Mako-infusion.
[2:01:05] <ShinobiPhoenix> same reason people don't die from being slashed at just once
[2:01:08] <@Nightbot> Plague is a youtube animator and also streams at https://picarto.tv/Plague . Also: t-shirts! http://goo.gl/lze8QO
[2:01:14] <ScreamLord> @PlagueOfGripes Well remember, this is supposed to be 1 of like 3 or 4 games. So you'll probably be getting a lot of things earlier than before
[2:01:15] <garekerag> Noprize explanation: materia provides ablative shield that blocks and dissipates incoming kinetic energy
[2:01:28] <garekerag> But it can only absorb so much, hence HP
[2:01:30] <Korgororo> people between all the jokes don't forget this is a video game LUL
[2:01:45] <GenericTwitchAcc1> is it?
[2:01:55] <NireFuster> but is it?
[2:02:02] <heroicspiritavenger> @garekerag you’re assuming anything will transfer between entries also
[2:02:08] <Coystick> Stagger that wagger
[2:02:09] <Korgororo> pvpS that's what I've been told
[2:02:31] <garekerag> I read it as an explanation somewhere for the DRK thing, might have been from Yoshi-P (PBUH)
[2:02:35] <Jrockoni> does the fact that Vincent was a scientist ever do anything?
[2:02:44] <JohnClaggart> basic stat increases
[2:03:04] <KaiserMario> Pat missed those boxes nest to the chest
[2:03:13] <heroicspiritavenger> @jrockoni he was a Turk, not a scientist. His Waifu was a scientist.
[2:03:29] <Sokumotanaka> @Jrockoni Vincent wasn;t a scientist he was a turk
[2:03:44] <Jrockoni> @heroicspiritavenger ah, man it's been to long. I'm forgetting things.
[2:04:11] <heroicspiritavenger> @jrockoni you’re mixing Vincent up with Sol Badguy from Guilty Gear. He was a scientist.
[2:04:13] <Korgororo> Vincent's back story is also a doujin pvpSK
[2:04:28] <heroicspiritavenger> @korgororo a NTR doujin
[2:04:29] <Tikigod784> vincent's backstory is a trash fetish
[2:04:30] <JohnClaggart> sol badguy is a robot
[2:04:34] <NireFuster> What exactly are materias and how do they work? Not in-game but, imagine if they existed irl
[2:04:37] <NireFuster> are they just balls?
[2:04:44] <Tikigod784> the balls are
[2:04:52] <+Dresdran> Bison bucks.
[2:05:02] <+Dresdran> Cloud can't jump.
[2:05:02] <Tikigod784> it doesn't make a bit of difference guys
[2:05:07] <+Dresdran> Wouldn't look cool.
[2:05:08] <Jrockoni> Sol badguy getting angry over someone fucking up his data sheets will never not be funny
[2:05:09] <garekerag> They're kind of chunks of materialized soul energy I guess? A lot like FFXIV crystals
[2:05:29] <Korgororo> @heroicspiritavenger worked once so let's do it again I guess? LUL
[2:05:45] <garekerag> plague getting wrecked
[2:06:03] <deligador> Your health is low, do you have any potions or food?
[2:06:06] <+Dresdran> Plague, for the love of god heal yourself.
[2:06:10] <garekerag> is there a reason that plague is basically not healing that i'm missing
[2:06:46] <+Dresdran> He loves to live dangerously.
[2:06:57] <@Nightbot> @CursedNobleman -> Boop! [stop spamming emotes] [warning]
[2:06:58] <Korgororo> he's old and doesn't actually like games NotLikeThis
[2:07:03] <garekerag> he's sitting at 1/3rd to 1/4 health constantly and that is Anxiety+++
[2:07:10] <CursedNobleman> item hoarding psaGoblin
[2:07:18] <garekerag> he's got healing materia!
[2:07:45] <JohnClaggart> so i guess thats how you grind ap early
[2:07:46] <arkv01> aim assisted mode is now available
[2:07:58] <garekerag> "would you like to switch to very easy mode?"
[2:08:00] <JohnClaggart> just die at the last enemy
[2:08:06] <@dcn2049> hahaha
[2:08:15] <garekerag> "intentionally"
[2:08:28] <BrachyZoid> You know what that means
[2:08:31] <garekerag> hiding behind corners is just being a good tank
[2:08:31] <BrachyZoid> you have to do it more
[2:08:33] <BrachyZoid> SPITE
[2:08:34] <Korgororo> plague you're just bad don't pretend pvpSK
[2:08:48] <extradopeness> Dude I am doing that right now
[2:08:49] <Korgororo> but we enjoy it
[2:09:08] <kuzokai> ap is per enemy
[2:09:25] <garekerag> also why does this feel like a total conversion of ffxv
[2:09:31] <MrHappyFunshine> I tend to be on auto pilot when i play games so it is hard for me to goof off unless something distracts me
[2:09:44] <%caramello_man> "hey you, stop running round the fountain"
[2:09:45] <garekerag> keep on expecting cloud to yeet his sword at stuff
[2:10:02] <@dcn2049> And kite a whole mob of assholes
[2:10:23] <garekerag> haha, that wasn't just an old mmo thing you do it to group up those asshole mages
[2:10:24] <NireFuster> I really like how they did Cloud's design on this, I love that they kept the big goofy baggy pants
[2:10:33] <garekerag> i still do it in ffxiv sometimes
[2:10:42] <shalashasknya> What are these gimp ninjas?
[2:11:00] <garekerag> yeah they probably leash
[2:11:28] <MrHappyFunshine> That is some high quality sick nasty
[2:11:31] <superspartaxyZED> plague likes thrusting eh?
[2:11:38] <thecrazyanbu> "Let's charge at the guy with a sword. We have guns!"
[2:11:44] <garekerag> see? cloud's a drk, using tank tricks
[2:11:48] <MrHappyFunshine> I like the way you thrust Cloud
[2:12:12] <KaiserMario> @PlagueOfGripes I think there might have been a small alley you missed back there
[2:12:12] <NireFuster> Cloud talks to himself
[2:12:19] <JohnClaggart> plague enjoying kingdom hearts combat
[2:12:58] <Korgororo> kh combat is fun NotLikeThis
[2:13:09] <KaiserMario> @PlagueOfGripes Those enemies were in front of the alley I mentioned
[2:13:25] <NireFuster> LOVELESS
[2:13:37] <KaiserMario> Oh, sorry then
[2:14:02] <garekerag> juggle looks really great
[2:14:16] <KellBeII> always feel bad for the jims and joes working as guards
[2:14:20] <jiin6> there's an entire street called loveless
[2:14:31] <MrHappyFunshine> Please, i don't want to remember Loveless
[2:14:33] <NireFuster> ThE gIfT oF tHe GodDeSs
[2:14:43] <cyberblueneon> i wonder if loveless if a reference to the my bloody valentine album
[2:14:43] <thecrazyanbu> It started out for a normal day for Tommy as he had coffee with his wife and promised his daughter he'd help her with her homework when he got back from work.
[2:14:57] <Korgororo> DuMb AppLes
[2:15:01] <KellBeII> then he was bisected by cloud
[2:15:05] <NireFuster> In Crisis Core Genesis always brings it up
[2:15:11] <NireFuster> He specifically only talks in Loveless quotes
[2:15:12] <+Neoripo> Yes, crisis core
[2:15:18] <SuperVaderMan> oof ouch, I'm bleeding 3s and 4s
[2:15:19] <NireFuster> Not even joking
[2:15:31] <KellBeII> i like that theyre shooting at you through the wall
[2:15:34] <Korgororo> gackt has a hard on for loveless
[2:15:38] <KaiserMario> Game says no...
[2:15:42] <Jrockoni> if only cloud would invest in idk a pistol
[2:15:50] <MrHappyFunshine> Genesis constantly referenced it and there is a goddess boss that has something to do with Loveless
[2:16:03] <+PartyTimeAustin> Well he at least has grenades
[2:16:08] <raminnoodle420> Guns? what are those?
[2:16:08] <arkv01> man that CC goddess boss was hot
[2:16:10] <arkv01> minerva IIRC
[2:16:30] <thecrazyanbu> When you have an iron bangle does that mean you can walk like an egyptian?
[2:16:35] <KaiserMario> "magic" Plague...
[2:16:44] <Shwepie> Mako Magic.
[2:16:45] <CursedNobleman> so that they didnt have to update the character model
[2:16:49] <MKUltima> Nanomachine charms
[2:16:56] <+Dresdran> Darn. Must sleep.
[2:17:02] <CursedNobleman> like, how many videogames of that era updated models based on armor
[2:17:02] <Korgororo> oh no video game logic in my video game pvpS
[2:17:04] <garekerag> It's magic! (literally might project a supporting field using mako energy)
[2:17:09] <+Dresdran> Have fun with this ... interesting game, Plague.
[2:17:15] <thecrazyanbu> Armor is based off of how stylish you look in this universe
[2:17:15] <WhoInvitedZach> How's it goin fellas?
[2:17:25] <garekerag> No, that's FFXV
[2:17:46] <arkv01> I hope theres replay value by letting us play dolled up cloud from the get go in NG+
[2:17:47] <GenericTwitchAcc1> no me :)
[2:17:51] <CursedNobleman> legend of legaia is one of the few early games i recall that showed armor changes
[2:17:53] <+Spiggerus> games not finished
[2:17:53] <@dcn2049> none of these answers for the "armor" is satisfactory
[2:18:03] <FinchBot> no time, game ships tomorrrow
[2:18:14] <KaiserMario> Probably just for flavour, rather than being an actual thing
[2:18:33] <garekerag> Well, in FFXV it literally was magic; regular items were imbued with kingsguard magic which gave them their protective and restorative properties
[2:18:38] <Shwepie> No time, game ships tomorrow, we'll put the textures in the day one patch, it'll be fine!
[2:18:50] <superspartaxyZED> the real answer is that theyre used like wonder woman bracelets and everyone can deflect bullets
[2:19:04] <MrHappyFunshine> I kinda liked how the SOLDIERs used a lance as their weapon in FF7, CC turned it into a sword
[2:19:07] <NireFuster> nice textures
[2:19:13] <garekerag> okay screw the dress let's see cloud dressed up as wonder woman
[2:19:36] <+Neoripo> yeah, outside of the reactor, textures are not great
[2:19:40] <KaiserMario> @PlagueOfGripes I gotta say, your way of playing slow and experimenting with everything is very chill and I appreciate it
[2:20:07] <arkv01> oh stamp LUL
[2:20:15] <MrHappyFunshine> I don't wanna
[2:20:15] <garekerag> "doors and corners", *expanse flashback*
[2:20:17] <Korgororo> poor textures are a reference to the original game
[2:20:19] <Murphio_GS> lol
[2:20:27] <MrHappyFunshine> don't make me
[2:20:28] <Johnmaddened> totally never again
[2:20:47] <KaiserMario> Classic Plague...
[2:20:58] <Murphio_GS> Brick chan getting attention
[2:21:00] <@dcn2049> oh god bricks again
[2:21:04] <Korgororo> 'brick moment'
[2:21:07] <arkv01> I vaguely recall the whole city was built during the lifetime of prez shinra
[2:21:07] <KellBeII> the rounded degradation on the top indicates that people have been sitting on it
[2:21:09] <Coystick> It's Europe: The City, on a plate
[2:21:21] <arkv01> which is immensely impressive, even if they are an evil megacorp
[2:21:31] <NireFuster> I don't think I've ever seen anyone think so deeply about a worn out brick paint texture
[2:21:33] <MrHappyFunshine> Maybe the plates were raised up
[2:21:46] <thecrazyanbu> Small details make the big pictures
[2:21:54] <garekerag> that reason is "whoa that looks cool"
[2:21:54] <KaiserMario> @PlagueOfGripes There could be some extra withering due to Mako radiation?
[2:21:55] <@dcn2049> Or they copied a picture
[2:22:03] <NireFuster> Or maybe it's a reused asset LUL LUL
[2:22:09] <garekerag> lol nothing matters
[2:22:15] <arkv01> now I want FF7: Stock JPEG textures edition
[2:22:21] <shalashasknya> You have a P.O. Box?
[2:22:30] <shalashasknya> Imma mail you a brick..
[2:22:37] <thecrazyanbu> Jimmy had a date with that cute girl from across the street that night. Until he was called in for an emergency.
[2:22:38] <+Neoripo> yeah, baybe rich folks reconstructed their houses in the plates
[2:23:03] <Coystick> Tbh I prefer classic dnd-styled FF settings, the future ones are too messy aesthetically
[2:23:37] <garekerag> hell yeah, medieval settings like FF4 and FF6 are the best, technology always messes up final fantasy games
[2:23:48] <NireFuster> I played but didn't finish 4 and it was really cool
[2:23:55] <+Neoripo> FF7 still has an old-new aesthetic, but 8 is a mess
[2:24:01] <garekerag> </sarcasm>
[2:24:01] <KaiserMario> @garekerag FF6 had mechs tho...
[2:24:12] <KaiserMario> Oh, sarcasm
[2:24:23] <garekerag> like every FF is a weird mashup of fantasy and tech, though usually it's steampunk
[2:24:36] <Coystick> Welcome to Bargasm
[2:24:40] <arkv01> yassir
[2:24:43] <CursedNobleman> i am awesome-o
[2:24:43] <Korgororo> pvpS
[2:24:46] <MrHappyFunshine> 8 is probably my favourite aesthetically
[2:24:46] <arkv01> would you like a cuppa gassmo
[2:24:48] <garekerag> was ff6 the first one with magitek or was it earlier
[2:24:57] <MrHappyFunshine> Hojo's Orgasmachine
[2:24:57] <arkv01> ff6 I think
[2:25:03] <Shwepie> I know a person whose last name is cosmo, but they spell it csomo.
[2:25:11] <SonofStranger> never really had much interest in final fantasy
[2:25:15] <garekerag> 8 is gorgeous, pity they designed it to sell hint guides
[2:25:15] <Coystick> try our famous Bargasm COCKtail
[2:25:18] <arkv01> everything before was very fantasy era technology only, except maybe 4 with space whales
[2:25:42] <xstormyone> Ff4 had wierd magitek stuff in Space
[2:25:47] <garekerag> oh riiight
[2:26:07] <$jobbedbone> remember kids, W is the double letter
[2:26:15] <arkv01> yeah, hopefully we'll get a QoL patch for that
[2:26:24] <KaiserMario> @garekerag Yes, I always liked 8's tech design, shame about everything else...
[2:26:41] <sosuke5> ouch
[2:26:43] <HyperBomb21> It's p fun
[2:26:43] <BrachyZoid> Yeeeeeeeeeeeeeah
[2:26:52] <JohnClaggart> pee break time
[2:26:52] <extradopeness> Stinger.
[2:26:55] <arkv01> I chuckle, but tbh we do need nomura's edgy designs
[2:27:00] <SonofStranger> "use" the "bathroom
[2:27:03] <FinchBot> nomura can't write
[2:27:06] <garekerag> I liked the drawing/GF system in 8
[2:27:09] <+PartyTimeAustin> Nomura can’t help himself can he
[2:27:09] <NireFuster> hey plague I forgot to ask you, how is the quarantine treating you?
[2:27:24] <SonofStranger> so is this game's plot basically just final fantasy 7 again?
[2:27:27] <arkv01> oh perfect transition time
[2:27:28] <Frankomancer> oh god what did he do? I havent paid attention to this games development
[2:27:29] <+Neoripo> @PlagueOfGripes i think battle system is designed by the same guy that did KH2's and NOT kh 3's
[2:27:30] <arkv01> train jump scene?
[2:27:37] <FinchBot> he's a good artist and decent idea guy
[2:27:37] <Coystick> Rule of thumb could be: any tech beyond an airship better be ultra rare & godlike, Lunar Whale handled that well in 4.
[2:27:39] <arkv01> wait wheres the train
[2:27:41] <+PartyTimeAustin> This part is so cool
[2:27:49] <HyperBomb21> Yeah, really cool boss
[2:27:51] <%JailShmixRemix> @SonofStranger no they are changing stuff sadly
[2:27:51] <+PartyTimeAustin> Here comes the actual battle music
[2:27:54] <garekerag> neoripo: honestly it's very very FFXV from what I'm seeing, which is in turn very KH2
[2:28:04] <deligador> Bulletproof skin.
[2:28:05] <thecrazyanbu> Grenaten
[2:28:09] <+Neoripo> OMG
[2:28:14] <+forgetme000> I'm hoping the better writers in the room will be able to curve the stupid shit into some thing better
[2:28:21] <HyperBomb21> Here he comes
[2:28:21] <arkv01> one cheeky boy with grenades vs a platoon
[2:28:22] <garekerag> honestly there's been as many future/alt present FFs as past ones at this point
[2:28:30] <HyperBomb21> The Huntsman
[2:28:35] <Frankomancer> so is the combat actually good?
[2:28:38] <SuperVaderMan> Big boy shield
[2:28:48] <HyperBomb21> Yeah
[2:28:50] <KaiserMario> Stun baton
[2:28:51] <HyperBomb21> He has a stun baton
[2:28:56] <arkv01> big baton dick
[2:28:56] <garekerag> PLAGUE HAS HP
[2:29:05] <Korgororo> special name cus he's kicking your butt pvpFATTERZ
[2:29:06] <+Neoripo> It looks like XV but without the massive amounts of jank and with a working magic system
[2:29:09] <KaiserMario> LOOK AT HIS DARK SOULS
[2:29:10] <Coystick> Drop you're shield
[2:29:10] <theloganbrand> He looks like that one storm trooper in force awakens
[2:29:22] <garekerag> TR-8R
[2:29:22] <MrHappyFunshine> When they first showed off the remake there was a trooper who showed up that knew Cloud, i wonder if he still does or if they cut that
[2:29:28] <Frankomancer> ok cool, maybe ill end up getting this game then
[2:29:28] <Korgororo> or he was anyway NotLikeThis
[2:29:30] <KaiserMario> GIANTDAD over here...
[2:29:41] <SonofStranger> POISE discovered in final fantasy 7
[2:29:43] <garekerag> PREPARE THE BASS CANNON
[2:29:56] <arkv01> cmon train anytime now
[2:29:58] <HyperBomb21> Magic works too
[2:30:19] <KaiserMario> Is this the Dark Souls of Final Fantasy?
[2:30:27] <MrHappyFunshine> oh there he is
[2:30:43] <arkv01> oh, this must be uh
[2:30:49] <HyperBomb21> Its interesting
[2:30:49] <arkv01> one of his grunt soldier mates?
[2:30:50] <+LordSDB> Maybe he recognized the sword?
[2:30:53] <+Neoripo> Maybe he worked with him
[2:30:55] <kuzokai> cloud was originally just a grunt, remember
[2:30:55] <sugarmostly> yeah this isn't a remake
[2:30:56] <arkv01> cause cloud was originally a grunt
[2:30:57] <+Neoripo> as a grunt
[2:31:09] <NireFuster> remember the guy that loved zack?
[2:31:11] <VERDAXY> ha
[2:31:13] <Coystick> JESSIE PLS CONTAIN IT
[2:31:16] <%Samex_Comex> Wedge rules
[2:31:18] <KaiserMario> "in fact, we all should..."
[2:31:20] <CyberDingus> jessie CAN'T
[2:31:21] <NireFuster> maybe it's him and recognized the sword
[2:31:23] <FinchBot> biggs is so handsome, forget the rwink
[2:31:27] <arkv01> maybe he was just really hot among the grunts
[2:31:34] <jiin6> the helmets do come off
[2:31:39] <arkv01> and the locker room was a free for all
[2:31:39] <StromkoPenguin> The Runaround = Massacre
[2:31:42] <$sleepy_coffee> Cloud was that random grunts child’s god fauther
[2:31:46] <SonofStranger> RRRGH GRUMPY BLACK MAN
[2:31:51] <KaiserMario> I think anyone would remember that hair...
[2:32:01] <jiin6> what do you know about sailors?
[2:32:08] <+Neoripo> Grunts don't wear their helmets 24/7
[2:32:12] <Frankomancer> oh christ did nomura actually change the plot
[2:32:15] <BrachyZoid> Were they not a thing in the original?
[2:32:17] <BrachyZoid> the ghosts
[2:32:20] <JohnClaggart> i like the weathering on cloud's armour
[2:32:21] <MrHappyFunshine> Cloud didn't wear his helmet much, other than when he went to Nibleheim
[2:32:21] <VERDAXY> Jessie take him to corner
[2:32:27] <garekerag> nope, no ghosts
[2:32:32] <%caramello_man> "SHE? Who is this bitch?"
[2:32:36] <KaiserMario> It's a tie to KH
[2:32:51] <SonofStranger> I keep hearing plague's fan/ac/whatever and thinking it's actually in the VA clips
[2:32:53] <terminusterminal> Does Barrett really think him and Cloud can actually hide in a crowd?
[2:33:01] <$sleepy_coffee> They be weaponizing ghosts
[2:33:02] <arkv01> great, me too
[2:33:04] <extradopeness> Yeah but when do we get to Zanarkand
[2:33:06] <JohnClaggart> it's the ps4 screaming
[2:33:07] <arkv01> hot monkey
[2:33:11] <superspartaxyZED> nice monkey
[2:33:14] <+Spiggerus> ugly monkey
[2:33:17] <NireFuster> sexy monkey
[2:33:17] <CursedNobleman> LUL
[2:33:17] <superspartaxyZED> like the honkers
[2:33:30] <BrachyZoid> koboldLul
[2:33:35] <JohnClaggart> not much he can do about ff7 r killing his ps4
[2:33:39] <Korgororo> man I wish journey was slightly longer
[2:33:57] <sugarmostly> why
[2:33:59] <CyberDingus> Is Jessia a semen demon?
[2:34:05] <superspartaxyZED> LEWD
[2:34:07] <arkv01> good girl
[2:34:08] <CursedNobleman> oh nooooooo
[2:34:12] <Johnmaddened> cute
[2:34:14] <Frankomancer> ok that was just smut
[2:34:25] <CyberDingus> Extreme headpats
[2:34:37] <Korgororo> seeing some of the concept art made me want to explore some other environments
[2:35:07] <Murphio_GS> Gigantic woolie is hilarious
[2:35:20] <cyberblueneon> is it true that sephiroth has the script of the original game and he is trying to change the events to his favor?
[2:35:27] <NireFuster> hot monkeys
[2:35:27] <MrHappyFunshine> Yes
[2:35:34] <CursedNobleman> its a metaphor. sephiroth is nomura
[2:35:42] <SonofStranger> All I associate with this game is reddit manlets complaining about how they feminized Cloud's design
[2:35:44] <JohnClaggart> gackt is nomura
[2:35:47] <BrachyZoid> brachy1Linkgood
[2:35:56] <superspartaxyZED> nice art
[2:36:00] <+OneGorillionDollars> the fact that he chose old wrinkly wailing ghosts to represent old fans who don't want change is simultaneously upsetting and hilarious
[2:36:04] <+FunkyRot> game is stinky
[2:36:05] <superspartaxyZED> really enjoying the slideshow
[2:36:07] <midnightmadness32> How's it going everybody?
[2:36:08] <kingra> It's alright.
[2:36:09] <KaiserMario> I think you're doing a fine job, sir
[2:36:10] <Maids4lyfe> I'm enjoying watching it enough that I want to play
[2:36:10] <CursedNobleman> my favorite stuff hasnt even started LUL
[2:36:13] <BrachyZoid> I mean, I know nothing of the original and even I feel like it feels too expository
[2:36:13] <superspartaxyZED> theres your feedback
[2:36:14] <Murphio_GS> It's all very nice Plague
[2:36:16] <Korgororo> I wish kale looked like either one of your saiyan girls NotLikeThis
[2:36:25] <Explodincatz> i never played the game, it looks ok
[2:36:26] <%JailShmixRemix> The game is very pretty and plays well, but I'm worried about the story
[2:36:27] <MrHappyFunshine> The ghosts depress me and amuse me
[2:36:29] <JohnClaggart> private public and general specific
[2:36:31] <Sokumotanaka> I think ff16 needs to have more beastial and non human races
[2:36:33] <FinchBot> story is bad, other stuff is cool
[2:36:43] <CursedNobleman> some writers never stop writing
[2:36:49] <+Neoripo> Character personalities are closer to FF7 original. except Sephi
[2:36:53] <jiin6> oh yeah that
[2:36:58] <superspartaxyZED> nice product placement
[2:37:01] <CursedNobleman> writing onto a story thats already complete
[2:37:04] <+northsouthmiddledakota> Because they can't compare to the previous work
[2:37:20] <KaiserMario> Like DmC?
[2:37:22] <sosuke5> because MY thing is better
[2:37:26] <+northsouthmiddledakota> must be the pressure
[2:37:28] <jiin6> comic industry is learning the hard way
[2:37:28] <midnightmadness32> We talking about the new Star Wars trilogy?
[2:37:29] <SonofStranger> maybe there should be a let's gripe about sequels
[2:37:38] <CursedNobleman> @KaiserMario we do not talk about dmc. this is a christian household
[2:37:47] <KaiserMario> Sorry
[2:37:47] <thecrazyanbu> Probably as a pre-emptive way to rebuke the people who are so enamoured with the original IP that any change will be heresy to them?
[2:37:48] <arkv01> welcome back clodd
[2:37:49] <$sleepy_coffee> Sounded like kitty cats and I became slightly frightened
[2:37:50] <extradopeness> Dino?
[2:37:51] <JohnClaggart> oh, white chocolate?
[2:37:59] <BrachyZoid> If I may ask, do you have any rules regarding fanart?
[2:38:02] <arkv01> drink lots of water!
[2:38:04] <NireFuster> white chocolate is superior
[2:38:07] <JohnClaggart> i couldnt stand em nor the white reeses cups
[2:38:08] <Coystick> white choc is supreme
[2:38:09] <@dcn2049> white chocolate is a lie
[2:38:18] <DrFaustMD> got an AD for FF7
[2:38:18] <DaFunkyBoy> This... is my first time seeing real Plague
[2:38:21] <Coystick> this means war
[2:38:23] <DaFunkyBoy> I was not prepared
[2:38:23] <extradopeness> All I heard was “Dino Dino Dino”
[2:38:26] <Korgororo> white chocolate isn't even chocolate pvpSK
[2:38:33] <BrachyZoid> Loading squeeeeze
[2:38:34] <CursedNobleman> i like my chocolate like i like my women. bitter
[2:38:37] <thecrazyanbu> Or as a way to deal with outdated values etc. that were inherent in the original work?
[2:38:43] <$jobbedbone> white chocolate is the realest thing in my world
[2:38:46] <SonofStranger> PRAISE LOADING CRATE THE WORLD CANNOT PROCEED WITHOUT HIM
[2:38:48] <NireFuster> @dafunkyboy did it live up to expectations
[2:38:50] <midnightmadness32> The camera is just so close to the character.
[2:38:52] <MrHappyFunshine> Just a moment about train security scans and that was it
[2:38:52] <jiin6> i like Hazelnut
[2:39:03] <DrFaustMD> there's about 15 to 20 models
[2:39:12] <jiin6> yeah you see reused npc's i blame the mako
[2:39:16] <CursedNobleman> the costumes are so weird. you have modern streetwear and 1920s citywear
[2:39:17] <gnollAUS> You have to reuse models. Can you imagine making a new model for every single person in a town?
[2:39:19] <DaFunkyBoy> @NireFuster Can one every truly comprehend such as plague with real human expectations?
[2:39:20] <KaiserMario> I don't think you're supposed to think about that too hard...
[2:39:36] <KaiserMario> Like, stop peeking behind the curtain Plague...
[2:39:39] <CyberDingus> @PlagueOfGripes who ?
[2:39:40] <DrFaustMD> also I think Plague will like the NPC holding the gun in front of the train grave yard
[2:39:40] <Murphio_GS> Dweebus found
[2:39:41] <CursedNobleman> none of these outfits make sense
[2:39:44] <SonofStranger> literally me
[2:39:47] <jiin6> you'll find many a dwebus
[2:39:52] <sosuke5> spot the main character
[2:40:09] <DrFaustMD> wait youre telling me Nomura clothes don't make sense
[2:40:14] <jiin6> stop talking right now
[2:40:16] <SonofStranger> That talking animation is kinda ses
[2:40:17] <superspartaxyZED> wedge just cant get a break lmao
[2:40:18] <midnightmadness32> Honestly, I'd make room for a dude with a sword the size of a person.
[2:40:22] <thecrazyanbu> Cloud likes picking on fatties
[2:40:35] <CursedNobleman> not the nomura clothes, but you have women wearing librarian/schoolmarm stuff, and streetwear in the same traincar
[2:40:37] <superspartaxyZED> excuse me?
[2:40:38] <@Nightbot> Plague is a youtube animator and also streams at https://picarto.tv/Plague . Also: t-shirts! http://goo.gl/lze8QO
[2:40:42] <sosuke5> no, this is important
[2:40:44] <jiin6> Nomura NEEDS MORE ZIPPERS AND PLAID
[2:40:47] <gordieda20> LUL
[2:40:49] <CyberDingus> she has TITTIES
[2:40:52] <%JailShmixRemix> SHES VERY OLD
[2:40:53] <jiin6> She's in the clear
[2:40:55] <BrachyZoid> Short women are not kids, Plague
[2:40:57] <arkv01> she's clean, officer
[2:41:01] <KaiserMario> A mature woman
[2:41:08] <Murphio_GS> Properly positioned
[2:41:12] <DrFaustMD> you could argue its rush hour or that they're packed on because the explosion
[2:41:13] <superspartaxyZED> HOHOOH
[2:41:22] <Coystick> touch her butt
[2:41:24] <DaFunkyBoy> Cloud is the only anime character in this entire train
[2:41:26] <NireFuster> country boy
[2:41:29] <BrachyZoid> oh nice
[2:41:31] <jiin6> she's probably an important character

[2:42:00] <Coystick> draw her crushing on wedge from a distance
[2:42:09] <Tikigod784> ^that
[2:42:11] <kingra> Take a HINT buddy PunOko
[2:42:20] <BrachyZoid> But have you taken the hint?
[2:42:23] <NireFuster> are they really discussing the fact they just blew up a reactor in a cramped train??
[2:42:24] <MrHappyFunshine> Why is she marked as ???
[2:42:26] <superspartaxyZED> man cloud is a dickhead
[2:42:32] <DaFunkyBoy> Seeing "normals" in FF is so odd!
[2:42:44] <SonofStranger> OCELOTTE
[2:42:45] <NireFuster> as if people aren't going to hear them and inmediately call the police

[2:43:02] <Coystick> it's a giant riceball, i mean jelly donut
[2:43:03] <garekerag> this makes me miss ffxii where everybody is dressed completely bizarrely
[2:43:03] <KaiserMario> @PlagueOfGripes Do you know anything about that girl NPC you noticed? The onw with the hat?
[2:43:04] <arkv01> its a sephiroth baby in there

[2:43:36] <SonofStranger> hack in freecam
[2:43:37] <terminusterminal> Is there a picture mode you can use with your PS4 controller?
[2:43:40] <CyberDingus> @PlagueOfGripes calm thy tits
[2:43:46] <JohnClaggart> use the camera functions in menu
[2:43:49] <Coystick> wait for PC release
[2:43:54] <Rodzzila> That looks like Rorschach child LUL
[2:44:01] <superspartaxyZED> you cant throw them off the train
[2:44:02] <Apolonm> atpCap
[2:44:07] <gordieda20> LUL
[2:44:07] <SonofStranger> dweebus MULTIPLY
[2:44:07] <+Neoripo> Game knows what you want to do
[2:44:11] <arkv01> I can't believe we need an first person mode LUL
[2:44:12] <kuzokai> the forbidden one
[2:44:18] <extradopeness> Ocelotte
[2:44:22] <DaFunkyBoy> Hollow
[2:44:29] <Korgororo> it's vivi

[2:44:34] <Coystick> it's a spider child like that carttoon you did
[2:44:35] <DaFunkyBoy> Deep One?
[2:44:37] <superspartaxyZED> I can only imagine how barret got through this crowd
[2:44:37] <+Spiggerus> its freiza from dbz or something @PlagueOfGripes
[2:44:38] <BrachyZoid> Of course it's not human, it's a baby
[2:44:41] <kuzokai> it's a cactuar
[2:44:45] <RykerSkies> babby entoma
[2:44:47] <thecrazyanbu> That's a good point. Why isn't anyone taking note that there's a person with a 6 ft sword in the train car?
[2:44:49] <KaiserMario> Stop judging!
[2:44:50] <%JailShmixRemix> That definitely looks like a fly head
[2:44:55] <Murphio_GS> It's a soul eater
[2:44:55] <SonofStranger> I think we just caught a glimpse into Eli's subconscious
[2:44:56] <kuzokai> it's a don berry
[2:45:03] <$sleepy_coffee> Just cracking game up
[2:45:09] <DrFaustMD> he's in a soldier uniform
[2:45:09] <extradopeness> Looks like a Jiren baby
[2:45:14] <superspartaxyZED> Why is jessie talking about this in public
[2:45:17] <thecrazyanbu> FF7: Cherynobyl
[2:45:22] <Rodzzila> normal conversation to have in the TRAIN LUL
[2:45:24] <NireFuster> talk about the bomb a little louder so that everyone can hear
[2:45:25] <+Neoripo> Shitty Shinra construction
[2:45:28] <CursedNobleman> im talking about a bomb on a crowded streetcar named desire
[2:45:32] <@dcn2049> hahaha what
[2:45:36] <+forgetme000> stop talking about the bomb on the train
[2:45:38] <DrFaustMD> Mako can't melt steel beams
[2:45:40] <kingra> HEY ARE YOU GUYS TERRORISTS???
[2:45:44] <cyberblueneon> why arent they more curious about the ghosts
[2:45:47] <DaFunkyBoy> Why are some of these people wearing knights plate in a time when guns and giant mechs are a thing?
[2:45:52] <garekerag> you people clearly don't live in the city, people routinely air out weirdness on the subway
[2:46:07] <Korgororo> klarke Kent PogChamp
[2:46:11] <garekerag> SHUT UP BARRETT
[2:46:11] <terminusterminal> SO MUCH FOR COVER BARRETT
[2:46:12] <%caramello_man> you guys are talking about cloud but barret has a fucking minigun as his arm!!
[2:46:15] <SonofStranger> Is Cloud one of those face on a stick protagonists? I know virtually nothing about this game
[2:46:24] <xstormyone> Good cover barrett
[2:46:27] <terminusterminal> WHY ARE YOU TALKING SHIT GIRL?
[2:46:41] <thecrazyanbu> I like out of the three side guys the only one that cloud talked to was the lady.
[2:46:41] <garekerag> THAT'S HIM OFFICER THAT'S THE GUN GUY
[2:46:43] <%JailShmixRemix> It's because he's black huh lady!?
[2:46:48] <superspartaxyZED> barret you are doing even worse than jessie right now WTF
[2:46:48] <theloganbrand> Can't you hear it cryin out?!
[2:46:49] <jiin6> paint the big target
[2:46:50] <DrFaustMD> Barret says Evi terrorism is a okay
[2:46:57] <CyberDingus> Is he a politician?
[2:46:59] <+forgetme000> Im am your normal law abiding gun arm man
[2:47:01] <SuperVaderMan> LUL
[2:47:03] <arkv01> wow this dud got a real character model
[2:47:05] <Johnmaddened> LUL
[2:47:05] <Sokumotanaka> I clapped when I saw it
[2:47:06] <terminusterminal> Is this classic FF7?
[2:47:08] <SonofStranger> why was this scene necessary?
[2:47:08] <DaFunkyBoy> This scene is pure japan
[2:47:09] <jiin6> Japan vs Barret
[2:47:10] <BrachyZoid> uuuuh
[2:47:10] <SuperVaderMan> I love Middle Manager
[2:47:11] <thecrazyanbu> Barret is very subtle
[2:47:12] <+Neoripo> Lick his boots more
[2:47:14] <gordieda20> LUL
[2:47:19] <DrFaustMD> what a chad
[2:47:19] <garekerag> okay considering he's saying that to gun arm Barrett, mister middle manager has TITANIUM balls
[2:47:20] <terminusterminal> "Peace and Prosperity" is fighting words?
[2:47:21] <@dcn2049> why is this happening
[2:47:25] <CursedNobleman> yeah, super japanese
[2:47:27] <@dcn2049> What was the point of this
[2:47:28] <arkv01> this was in the original game
[2:47:29] <superspartaxyZED> and he just takes their spot wow
[2:47:32] <Frankomancer> this sure wasnt in the original....
[2:47:34] <SuperVaderMan> Middle Manager is my favorite character so far
[2:47:37] <kuzokai> think we will ever see barret without his sunglasses?
[2:47:37] <CyberDingus> big black man got OWNED
[2:47:38] <xstormyone> Somebody who is weirder than barrett
[2:47:42] <Korgororo> America vs Japan
[2:47:45] <Coystick> BELIEVE IN YOUR OWN JUSTICE
[2:47:51] <kingra> So can anyone tell me what the compilation is?
[2:47:54] <SonofStranger> Did this scene teach us literally anything about this world or these characters?
[2:47:59] <DrFaustMD> you see him without his shades in seventh heaven
[2:47:59] <kingra> Cause I don't know
[2:48:05] <CursedNobleman> Corrupt Shinra Manager EVISCERATED with FACTS and LOGIC
[2:48:19] <theloganbrand> @kingra all the sequel/prequel content
[2:48:20] <+forgetme000> compilation is all the ff7 spinoffs
[2:48:20] <arkv01> I dunno, barret has a gatling arm...
[2:48:21] <NireFuster> berret grumpy mc grumps
[2:48:24] <superspartaxyZED> this is literally the worst party
[2:48:25] <KaiserMario> ok, Ryuji
[2:48:28] <garekerag> sonofstranger: it teaches players that shinra has people who genuinely believe it's doing the right thing
[2:48:28] <Sokumotanaka> Oh it gets WORSE
[2:48:39] <BrachyZoid> Don't tell Wakka
[2:48:41] <@dcn2049> It's okay, they said it as an aside, that means nobody else heard it
[2:48:42] <SonofStranger> Are there not cameras and microphones on this train?
[2:48:42] <thecrazyanbu> Yelled the man with the gatling gun arm
[2:48:42] <BrachyZoid> I gotta tell Wakka
[2:48:45] <DaFunkyBoy> Sure makes me nervous being a TERRORIST
[2:48:50] <superspartaxyZED> how is biggs the only person not spilling the beans?
[2:48:52] <arkv01> mmm I love showers... with you biggs
[2:48:52] <theloganbrand> How did they find out we're the phantom thieves?
[2:49:01] <xstormyone> Eco terrorists that dont believe in hiding bombs
[2:49:02] <NireFuster> I SURE HOPE NO ONE FINDS OUT WE BLEW UP THAT REACTOR
[2:49:08] <+Doctor_Stew> They were no more subtle before.
[2:49:18] <extradopeness> Yeah can’t relate with a snitch
[2:49:21] <garekerag> *barrett tries to use gun arm to summon persona, liquifies his own head*
[2:49:23] <thecrazyanbu> I'm convinced the main characters are the gang from It's Always Sunny
[2:49:42] <+forgetme000> we are not the good guys
[2:49:47] <superspartaxyZED> do the good guys end multiple human lives barret? do they?
[2:49:55] <$jobbedbone> @Doctor_Stew back then voices didn't exist, so they were quieter Kappa
[2:49:58] <garekerag> "The Gang Blows Up The CIty"
[2:50:07] <Rodzzila> "are we the baddies?"
[2:50:09] <DrFaustMD> sometimes you gottaa break a few eggs to make an omlett
[2:50:13] <DaFunkyBoy> We're the good guys! Just ignore all the murder and terrorism we had to do
[2:50:14] <arkv01> uh, no jessie?
[2:50:14] <SonofStranger> "The gang causes a nuclear meltdown"
[2:50:16] <superspartaxyZED> man, she just wont listen

[2:50:47] <BrachyZoid> Exposition~ exposition~ now I know my ABC
[2:50:49] <thecrazyanbu> The Gang becomes TERRORISTS

[2:50:56] <Coystick> this is a map of Jessie's TUBES

[2:52:25] <Sokumotanaka> Barret: I'm serious cloud, turns himself into a fucking pickle, calls himself Pickle rick! Funniest shit I ever seen!
[2:52:32] <thecrazyanbu> The Gang Dabbles in Marxism
[2:52:43] <extradopeness> Oh god this preservation of the old lines is making me pull my collar a bit
[2:52:45] <DrFaustMD> Jessie: You can run a train on me Cloud
[2:52:46] <garekerag> The Gang Discovers Eco-Fascism

[2:53:14] <BrachyZoid> ISM
[2:53:15] <superspartaxyZED> LMAO
[2:53:16] <%bettysharkface> I...
[2:53:17] <NireFuster> the slums don't look that bad??
[2:53:18] <garekerag> "members lost, zero. Civilians lost, like thirty thousand or soemthing"
[2:53:18] <Cyral_Drive> LUL
[2:53:19] <gordieda20> LUL
[2:53:19] <%bettysharkface> Seriously?
[2:53:20] <StromkoPenguin> Hey everybody, we're big criminals!!
[2:53:27] <superspartaxyZED> THIS IS RIDICULOUS
[2:53:28] <Johnmaddened> he started the shouting LUL
[2:53:36] <NireFuster> LMAOOOO
[2:53:38] <GenericTwitchAcc1> god fucking damnit Ryuji
[2:53:38] <arkv01> who was ecoterrorist???
[2:53:39] <VERDAXY> WHERES MY MONEY
[2:53:39] <terminusterminal> I CAN BELIEVE SHINRA WAS AWARE OF AVALANCHE IN THIS REMAKE NOW
[2:53:41] <DaFunkyBoy> How has no good citizen reported all these shady looking fucks armed to the teeth?
[2:53:49] <NireFuster> GUYS LOWER YOUR VOICES AIGHT
[2:53:57] <Rodzzila> A line with station names is the best you get. No the entire city infrastructure LUL
[2:53:59] <+LordSDB> I think that line was for new people
[2:54:01] <theloganbrand> Barret got gams
[2:54:08] <+Neoripo> Barret was packing!
[2:54:12] <JohnClaggart> no, shh
[2:54:19] <MrHappyFunshine> He wants to see Marlene, of course he would run like a mad man
[2:54:21] <KaiserMario> I think he means, "at the place she works, you know?"
[2:54:27] <jiin6> cause money
[2:54:30] <garekerag> haha plague doesn't know what living in a big city is like
[2:54:34] <JohnClaggart> its the last train out, so they got on it because they couldnt go home
[2:54:36] <DaFunkyBoy> They are lowest tier bidnez scrubs
[2:54:36] <+Neoripo> Still not enough money
[2:54:38] <arkv01> kinda like how people commute to big cities for hours
[2:54:40] <garekerag> it's like SF except he's not actually homeless
[2:54:43] <+forgetme000> maybe its just dress code
[2:54:43] <vincerocmm> just one more promotion lol
[2:54:43] <CyberDingus> @PlagueOfGripes the rent is too high even for Middle Managers
[2:54:45] <thecrazyanbu> They were middle management. They probably don't have good wage growth
[2:54:50] <GenericTwitchAcc1> desk jockeys aren't necessarily management
[2:54:55] <DrFaustMD> commuting to the city to work at a shitty corporate job is like that
[2:54:59] <$jobbedbone> being a salaryman in the slums has to be the glummest existence
[2:55:00] <NireFuster> the slums don't even look that bad though
[2:55:07] <jiin6> like how japanese salary men still live in single room apartments
[2:55:13] <arkv01> LUL
[2:55:17] <Rodzzila> That was a polite way to say"I don't give a fuck about your husband" LUL
[2:55:25] <thecrazyanbu> If Barret really wanted to screw with Shinra he'd get their employees to unionize.
[2:55:25] <arkv01> so many orphans in the slums want barret to be their daddy
[2:55:33] <+forgetme000> eco-terrorism is fun
[2:55:35] <DrFaustMD> she's best girl. I like her voice
[2:55:43] <NireFuster> it did rule little girl, you're adopted by the way
[2:55:44] <xstormyone> I wanna be an eco terrorist when i grow up
[2:55:51] <DaFunkyBoy> Ghoooossst!
[2:55:51] <%bettysharkface> It's the ghosts again
[2:55:53] <Johnmaddened> GHOSTS
[2:55:56] <KaiserMario> Some guy
[2:55:57] <$jobbedbone> are there no monsters that look like ghosts?
[2:56:05] <%bettysharkface> Ghost train in the train graveyard
[2:56:06] <Frankomancer> wtf is this ghost shit
[2:56:07] <$jobbedbone> are ghosts their own unique entities?
[2:56:09] <DaFunkyBoy> Get your Transient Curses ready people
[2:56:12] <garekerag> if only you had some gigantic sharp piece of metal to cut the fence with
[2:56:13] <GenericTwitchAcc1> retcons reeee
[2:56:16] <CyberDingus> She holds a REALLY big gun
[2:56:20] <arkv01> nomuuuuuura PunOko
[2:56:22] <+Neoripo> there are ghosts in the graveyard
[2:56:26] <KaiserMario> But the Darkness...
[2:56:27] <terminusterminal> I swear if they start talking about Humanity and the Dark Soul....
[2:56:27] <MrHappyFunshine> The Time ghosts are roughing up people in the slums, pricks
[2:56:29] <NireFuster> you know what they say about women with big guns
[2:56:42] <SonofStranger> I WONDER IF WE'RE GONNA DO SOMETHING ABOUT THE GRAVEYARD GHOST
[2:56:43] <arkv01> where will I get my groceries now
[2:56:45] <$jobbedbone> EVERYWHERE THE LIGHT TOUCHES
[2:56:45] <CursedNobleman> @NireFuster easier to catch them?
[2:56:47] <arkv01> CMON OUT BITCH GHOSTS
[2:56:51] <vincerocmm> day ruined it lol
[2:56:55] <KaiserMario> YES
[2:56:56] <+forgetme000> theres nomora-ism behind that graveyard
[2:56:58] <KaiserMario> Yes he is
[2:56:58] <@dcn2049> probably
[2:57:00] <BrachyZoid> You think we will find Sora trying to get the power of waking?
[2:57:00] <+Doctor_Stew> Emo cant hang out at the graveyard, more at 11
[2:57:06] <CyberDingus> aww

[3:00:10] <SonofStranger> @PlagueOfGripes nomura literally using a coathanger on this game's script

[3:00:46] <+Neoripo> Look up
[3:00:49] <+Doctor_Stew> it looks industrial too
[3:00:51] <KaiserMario> I wonder how much of Nomura is still in this game, and how muchis not his work at all
[3:00:52] <Sokumotanaka> @jobbedbone Whatever Jobbednone more like Jobber bone
[3:00:55] <@Nightbot> Plague is a youtube animator and also streams at https://picarto.tv/Plague . Also: t-shirts! http://goo.gl/lze8QO

[3:42:59] <JohnClaggart> thats the hot lady
[3:43:35] <%Medrex> you work on the plate, you sure as fuck can't afford to live up there or leave
[3:43:46] <+Doctor_Stew> nobody here seems worried that a guy with a giant sword and mc hammer pants is stopping to overhear everyone's conversation
[3:43:49] <happyface699> You’d think they would have nothing to do but sink in their own poverty
[3:43:53] <Daigrey> Theatre normally costs money. She got free tickets
[3:44:10] <+dawsfloss> get away poor little boy
[3:44:10] <CyberDingus> Plague stop hoarding all the pussy!!
[3:44:18] <%caramello_man> no plague look at the trash
[3:44:19] <Maids4lyfe> 0/10 can't pet the dog or cat
[3:44:23] <happyface699> CANT TAKE CAT 0/10
[3:44:25] <ScreamLord> @PlagueOfGripes There is a corner area full of cats
[3:44:26] <NireFuster> plague hates poor kids
[3:44:33] <kiwicoffin> don't get too close to the background or you'll see the wires and seams
[3:44:48] <+Doctor_Stew> @NireFuster everyone hates poor kids, santa included
[3:44:54] <BrachyZoid> THAT'S LEWD
[3:45:03] <happyface699> @nirefuster They certainly aren’t cats so they don’t matter
[3:45:03] <CyberDingus> Hand holding.

[3:45:11] <TheWe4pon> Normura!!
[3:45:21] <+A_DEAD_SHOW> Keep the bloodline pure Plague
[3:45:23] <Sokumotanaka> My grandparents do that
[3:45:25] <BrachyZoid> I mean that's what my sister and her husband do
[3:45:26] <LordFalara> plague its fine their actually 8000 years old
[3:45:30] <kiwicoffin> that sounded like a shill

[3:45:44] <NireFuster> keep the bloodline pure
[3:45:45] <%caramello_man> how come no one is smoking crack in this slum, 0/10 not realistic
[3:45:53] <Sokumotanaka> Are those the SAME three assholes!?
[3:45:57] <Murphio_GS> I think it's just lazy background designs, which is whatever
[3:46:01] <SonofStranger> are these people the lumpenproletariat, or do they actually work?
[3:46:02] <jiin6> just cause they wear suits, doesn't mean they are rich
[3:46:04] <Huntercd> No they don't
[3:46:04] <Daigrey> You work for Shinra and STILL live in the slums?
[3:46:07] <happyface699> Listen the future is just pat and Paige’s. People in relationships that look related
[3:46:15] <happyface699> Get used to it
[3:46:20] <NireFuster> THOSE ARE THE THREE PEOPLE FROM THE TRAIN
[3:46:26] <Sokumotanaka> ^
[3:46:29] <+unclekulikov> Immigre
[3:46:52] <%Medrex> Only super rich or businesses can afford land on the plate. or your just a cubicle worker you get a kinda nice hovel
[3:46:57] <thecrazyanbu> Avalanche's new rivals are those three shinra employees
[3:46:57] <CyberDingus> @PlagueOfGripes or maybe the rent everywhere is so high that these three would rather live in slums
[3:46:59] <KaiserMario> Again, Japan has no idea how slums work
[3:47:12] <Frankomancer> so much pointless voice work,
[3:47:23] <JohnClaggart> construction and security
[3:47:28] <happyface699> All these people are like that old guy from last action hero. They have one job with no obligations taht hang out with dumb poor kids
[3:47:29] <BrachyZoid> scrappers
[3:47:34] <JohnClaggart> there's posters all over for the guard
[3:47:39] <laguerrilha> Dont think the slums was planned to have people living there
[3:47:49] <SuperVaderMan> cat
[3:47:50] <LordFalara> final fantasy 1 to 8 didnt really have alot of culture to the areas, you sped through them pretty fast and their infrastructure never holds up to scrutiny, im fine with them rewriting some things like this to make the world make sense
[3:47:52] <+Malambis> Gorgeous
[3:47:56] <kiwicoffin> They're the metaphorically flowers that grow from the soil

[4:06:11] <%Medrex> Most of the Jukebox songs are remix tracks
[4:06:14] <jiin6> its a remix of prelude
[4:06:14] <Gavaline> Main FF theme
[4:06:17] <happyface699> A little game known as final Fanta
[4:06:24] <JohnClaggart> it was also in ffx
[4:06:27] <arkv01> very beginning when tidus is on his ship home
[4:06:31] <JohnClaggart> before blitzball
[4:06:40] <LordFalara> this song is the final fantasy main tune
[4:06:45] <happyface699> This guy is very dissatisfied cloud is here
[4:06:51] <Pencildragon> yeah it sounds like the mix from FFX

[4:07:41] <happyface699> You could feel this mans dick limp when he saw cloud with tifa
[4:07:42] <garekerag> possibly the same track, they like recycling tracks these days (witness music in FFXV car)
[4:08:11] <NireFuster> are tifa and Jessie the hottest girls from the slums?

[4:12:13] <NireFuster> immediately before 7 @lordfalara

[4:12:32] <gunsrlove> That was the chance you loser
[4:12:41] <Pencildragon> cloud missing the hints Kappa

[4:14:07] <%caramello_man> "hey, you want my bed"
[4:14:14] <happyface699> Sounds like chris Redfields voice actor
[4:14:34] <SonofStranger> so far it seems this game is mostly nostalgia bait, but I wouldn't know since I havent played FF7
[4:14:37] <happyface699> I mean badger from breaking bads in this soooo

[4:15:06] <happyface699> Charlie sheen and badger
[4:15:10] <Wanky_Woop> Human talk
[4:15:16] <terminusterminal> HE'S GETTING PAID IN EXPOSURE

[4:16:27] <ElGranChorizato> wtf
[4:16:32] <LordFalara> 6 weapons for each of the 4 charecters
[4:16:36] <jiin6> SE they like ellaborate
[4:16:45] <ElGranChorizato> this is literally bonkers
[4:16:51] <kiwicoffin> They could have stopped at the FFX grid system
[4:16:59] <garekerag> wow it's crystarium but swords
[4:17:01] <jiin6> Sword brains
[4:17:02] <garekerag> swordarium
[4:17:03] <twenty112> When did Plague launch Warframe???
[4:17:04] <BrachyZoid> Their philosophy is "it will look cool"
[4:17:05] <GiygasDrillBreak> it's 2020, fam, you know SE has 10 art creators for ever 1 programmer
[4:17:06] <JohnClaggart> skyrim skills
[4:17:31] <arkv01> whats with the galaxies, are we going to space?
[4:17:33] <happyface699> IT WILL LOOK COOL GUYS SHIP IT
[4:17:38] <%bettysharkface> Are we playing Spore now?
[4:17:41] <BrachyZoid> wtf is this UI
[4:17:43] <Wanky_Woop> Curing herpes menu gonna be the same
[4:17:46] <LordFalara> this menu is conplete ass
[4:17:49] <Explodincatz> yup
[4:17:52] <JohnClaggart> you can reset the camera
[4:17:53] <jiin6> Japan do it tho
[4:18:00] <LordFalara> genuinely no idea why they did it
[4:18:02] <Murphio_GS> Japan why
[4:18:05] <+senfood> he HATES it
[4:18:11] <garekerag> wait aren't you supposed to be getting new swords all the time how is this useful
[4:18:11] <Pencildragon> why do they spin why is that necessary
[4:18:18] <LordFalara> look at this menu youll spend a total of ten minutes in the entire game!
[4:18:18] <%caramello_man> yeah cos reset the camera of your upgrade screen makes sense
[4:18:25] <arkv01> can we just turn into a galian beast?
[4:18:29] <BrachyZoid> You could just get extra HP for safety
[4:18:29] <happyface699> This looks straight outta 2005 but more elaborate
[4:18:40] <badfaithmaxter> This is literally the crystarium from FFXIII
[4:18:43] <garekerag> this is extraordinarily ps3
[4:19:00] <LordFalara> is this spore
[4:19:06] <happyface699> It’s like a computer screensaver
[4:19:18] <kiwicoffin> as far as I've seen, you unlock them then move to another subtier
[4:19:31] <guyman125> you get more later on
[4:19:54] <%caramello_man> tutorial now ends idiot
[4:20:03] <garekerag> oh so you don't buy new weaps then
[4:20:10] <Explodincatz> always manual
[4:20:16] <BurdRightsActivist> Imagine having a childhood, this post was made by testube clone gang
[4:20:19] <garekerag> very ff8
[4:20:25] <LordFalara> you can find 6 weapons for each of the games 4 charecters
[4:20:28] <JohnClaggart> you buy different 7 foot swords

[4:20:49] <happyface699> Thanks badger
[4:21:01] <twenty112> Canonically, what did he just do to your sword?? Sharpen it?
[4:21:01] <redlancer8> Goku likes to eat and hes not fat
[4:21:02] <garekerag> oh man that is going to get UNWIELDY when the full cast shows up by the end of game 3
[4:21:03] <laguerrilha> Japanese hair is pretty. shine so much
[4:21:06] <CyberDingus> @PlagueOfGripes is she a street walker?
[4:21:13] <Murphio_GS> I like how people complained that her tits aren't fat enough despite being *THIS* fat
[4:21:18] <+Nephthyz> It's a character trait, it's just a lazy, surface level thing.
[4:21:24] <+StreamStopA> shes worked these streets more than anyone
[4:21:25] <happyface699> He wasn’t even that fat in breaking bad
[4:21:25] <Glassbrain> Oh yeah, the remake of the decade. As in, it’s shit, like this decade.
[4:21:47] <SonofStranger> DARKNESS
[4:21:55] <smugfox95> Power cut, not again
[4:21:56] <laguerrilha> shame we dont have that girl executing the boy
[4:21:58] <Gavaline> IMPRISONING ME
[4:22:00] <JohnClaggart> the darkening is the solar lens flare for exiting buildings
[4:22:01] <NireFuster> DAHKNESS
[4:22:15] <jiin6> Japan Culled them
[4:22:23] <happyface699> ALL THAT I SEE

[4:22:34] <SonofStranger> it makes sense if you like shorts
[4:22:37] <ElGranChorizato> I CANNOT LIVE
[4:22:38] <LordFalara> cloud expressing confusion at the icon above his head is great in ff7 original
[4:22:42] <+Nephthyz> He just looks like bootleg Riku.
[4:22:42] <Murphio_GS> It's anime boy
[4:22:43] <smugfox95> He just said, searching for candidates
[4:22:46] <happyface699> I CANNOT DIe
[4:22:49] <cursedcharley> Are those sock garters!?!
[4:22:50] <jiin6> hanky
[4:22:51] <+StreamStopA> Open console and type kill child
[4:22:56] <twenty112> Bandana

[4:22:58] <KaiserMario> It's Sherry Birkin
[4:23:00] <JohnClaggart> its a bandana on the strap
[4:23:02] <SonofStranger> It's a caterpillar
[4:23:03] <cursedcharley> That's his face
[4:23:08] <LordFalara> i hope this child gets eaten
[4:23:08] <CyberDingus> Tifa's tits should be bigger. for reasons
[4:23:08] <happyface699> BODY IS MY HOLDING CELL
[4:23:10] <laguerrilha> Its 9S
[4:23:11] <Gavaline> It's the inevitable tie in for Nomura's new game
[4:23:18] <happyface699> It’s a monacle
[4:23:21] <BrachyZoid> Smells like it will become important
[4:23:25] <SuperVaderMan> Cloud just wandering around, calling badly-dressed children assholes
[4:23:27] <Glassbrain> Imagine competing with the RE remakes with... this.
[4:23:37] <ElGranChorizato> Yo that sky box is garbage wtf
[4:23:48] <JohnClaggart> i did
[4:23:48] <BrachyZoid> HAH
[4:23:49] <laguerrilha> we did
[4:23:51] <KaiserMario> @PlagueOfGripes I said it
[4:23:52] <BrachyZoid> I didn't know
[4:23:53] <silverpoyozo> LUL
[4:23:54] <guyman125> we did
[4:23:58] <laguerrilha> but you will probably want 2 anyway

[4:24:40] <Glassbrain> Restore a percentage of missing health.
[4:24:42] <KaiserMario> Plague is cosplaying ChrisG
[4:24:43] <GiygasDrillBreak> it heals you better when you get hit hard
[4:25:00] <Glassbrain> It’s a league of legends ability.
[4:25:03] <GiygasDrillBreak> it also doesnt use MP
[4:25:05] <laguerrilha> and cure poison
[4:25:14] <psychosid64> @plagueofgripes yo what's up man!? long time viewer first time stream watcher how's it going today?
[4:25:29] <GiygasDrillBreak> Chakra = it's free real estate
[4:25:35] <happyface699> It’s also my first time in stream
[4:25:42] <+koraialstrasz> Nopn-shinra boxes
[4:26:00] <silverpoyozo> oh god
[4:26:07] <arkv01> oh god what oujin is this
[4:26:10] <CyberDingus> That monster wants some TifA tItS
[4:26:14] <LordFalara> fucking first two seconds of combat
[4:26:16] <jiin6> OH NO THE HENTAI HE COMIN
[4:26:22] <happyface699> TIFA IS FINE
[4:26:30] <twenty112> DO COMBO
[4:26:31] <happyface699> This is like my japanese animes
[4:26:37] <happyface699> DO COMBO
[4:26:41] <Glassbrain> Amazing. From powerhouse to combat load in one easy remake.
[4:26:54] <+koraialstrasz> battle settings
[4:27:01] <Wanky_Woop> She's so skinny and yet she's a fistfighter? Her chest must be Pure Muscle
[4:27:17] <Pencildragon> oh my god this menu is so kingdom hearts
[4:27:28] <happyface699> She is hot that’s how she gets through battle
[4:27:35] <NireFuster> Tifa should have more muscle I refuse to believe she's that strong when she looks weak af
[4:27:36] <CyberDingus> Tifa please, contain your vaginal juices.
[4:27:41] <arkv01> her tidds are hitboxes
[4:27:41] <Gavaline> He has skills, after all
[4:27:44] <happyface699> TIFA
[4:27:49] <happyface699> LISTEN
[4:27:51] <Frankomancer> ITS OVER
[4:27:54] <happyface699> GET OFF DICK
[4:28:08] <Glassbrain> I’m gonna go now so i don’t go and whine like the old fart i an over the slow death of turn based combat even though it’s doing fine elsewhere
[4:28:14] <JohnClaggart> it's stack system
[4:28:17] <silverpoyozo> sounds kinda neat
[4:28:22] <+koraialstrasz> sounds like long sword in monter hunter
[4:28:24] <laguerrilha> its pretty much a monk class
[4:28:42] <Pencildragon> this sounds like somebody trying to explain fighting games to me'
[4:28:42] <Wanky_Woop> Tifa must look like JoJo characters to be truly realistic
[4:29:05] <CyberDingus> @Wanky_Woop realistic =\= fun
[4:29:16] <arkv01> tifa could use the stress relief
[4:29:19] <psychosid64> giggity
[4:29:19] <Wanky_Woop> True That. But i like muscly women
[4:29:28] <NireFuster> Not really, fighters have strong toned muscles not giant muscles like pillar men
[4:29:41] <Explodincatz> normal or hard mode?
[4:29:41] <CyberDingus> Same, brother, and yet - eye candies are nice.
[4:29:56] <NireFuster> Tifa should be just as buff as Cloud
[4:30:05] <Wanky_Woop> Too Skinny, Japan.
[4:30:16] <Pencildragon> I hope the house monster returns
[4:30:19] <NireFuster> Japan fears muscles
[4:30:24] <NireFuster> They're weak
[4:30:25] <Wanky_Woop> No it doesnt
[4:30:26] <CyberDingus> Bruce Lee wasn't a body builder. Bruce Lee kicked a LOT of ass.
[4:30:37] <Wanky_Woop> Ate too
[4:30:48] <CyberDingus> He wasn't Arnie though.
[4:31:01] <KaiserMario> cowards...
[4:31:02] <laguerrilha> she need those abs lines
[4:31:03] <NireFuster> @cyberdingus he wasn't no bodybuilder but he was definitely buff
[4:31:05] <psychosid64> STRONG WOMAN!!
[4:31:05] <cursedcharley> Absolute cowards
[4:31:08] <+sourceofall> you are the fourth streamer i've heard say the enemies are too weak at this part
[4:31:10] <LordFalara> thats an issue with almost all action rpgs, it takes like 5 hours before enemys are durable enough for the combat system to exist
[4:31:15] <CyberDingus> Lean-buff, not buff-buff.
[4:31:25] <sosuke5> With Japan, it's either not enough muscle, or WAY too much.
[4:31:26] <happyface699> Idk tifa s hot
[4:31:27] <Gavaline> Only metal boxes can be cut - wood is too strong
[4:31:27] <NireFuster> Yeah toned buff not big buff
[4:31:30] <laguerrilha> A lot on west dont do the same
[4:31:32] <kiwicoffin> She should have cloud's toning
[4:31:35] <SonofStranger> she could use some tone
[4:31:38] <BrachyZoid> her arms in particular
[4:31:48] <twenty112> Give her some triceps
[4:31:58] <arkv01> the flood of tifa SFMs starts now
[4:32:00] <$sleepy_coffee> But them big oni ladies
[4:32:01] <KELTHUZAD9999> more muscle will be nice
[4:32:01] <NireFuster> she should be as toned as Cloud, thin but toned
[4:32:03] <impartialcredit> bustin bustin bustin
[4:32:06] <CyberDingus> legs too. She could use buffer legs.
[4:32:16] <CyberDingus> >everybody
[4:32:20] <CyberDingus> it's been less than a day, lady
[4:32:20] <vonmaultke> Terrified of changing minor muscle tone but crazy enough to nuke the story LUL Japan
[4:32:21] <Pencildragon> if anything cloud should have bigmuscles from lifting that massive ass sword, tifa should have toned muscles from punching
[4:32:27] <BrachyZoid> HOW DO THEY KNOW THO
[4:32:29] <silverpoyozo> that makes me like him a bit more tho
[4:32:31] <Wanky_Woop> Wait. Cloud's working for free?
[4:32:32] <happyface699> I’d fuck katie
[4:32:33] <twenty112> Number go UP
[4:32:34] <jiin6> Big murders
[4:32:35] <SonofStranger> while we're at it we could improve tifa's design by making her a muscle woman
[4:32:41] <psychosid64> @plagueofgripes whatcha drinking tonight?
[4:32:43] <happyface699> STONKS GO UP
[4:32:47] <NireFuster> @pencildragon in the ideal world yes that wouls be the casd
[4:32:47] <Gavaline> Wait, if everybody is talking about Cloud, why did he need to join Big and Wedge's secret club?
[4:32:56] <happyface699> sipsipGasm sipsipGasm sipsipGasm
[4:33:09] <KaiserMario> Considering her fighting style, Tifa should look closer to bunny girl from MHA
[4:33:10] <BrachyZoid> I know
[4:33:15] <JohnClaggart> you'll get goofy shit like chakra materia
[4:33:15] <BrachyZoid> MP Up +++
[4:33:23] <BrachyZoid> Just the same thing but stronger
[4:33:34] <NireFuster> let's not get too horny about muscles, chat
[4:33:40] <JohnClaggart> "ups x skill after counter hits"
[4:33:44] <jiin6> he will be smushed last
[4:33:47] <Wanky_Woop> Bunny girl from MHA is fucking berserk. She's awesome
[4:33:57] <KaiserMario> WHAT DO YOU THINK???
[4:33:58] <NotLysander> Cats seem to be popular
[4:34:04] <happyface699> @nirefuster This is the wrong community to say that to
[4:34:06] <Pencildragon> we got cats
[4:34:06] <KaiserMario> From this JRPG
[4:34:16] <GiygasDrillBreak> imagine the cat house in Wutai
[4:34:20] <jiin6> feel sadder soon
[4:34:29] <NireFuster> @happyface699 can't contain the horny

[4:36:16] <weatherreport240> thanks for the story Plague
[4:36:17] <jiin6> Farmers are fucked up
[4:36:19] <kiwicoffin> Just doing cat shit
[4:36:20] <sosuke5> Nature is fun
[4:36:21] <%bettysharkface> NotLikeThis NotLikeThis
[4:36:27] <KaiserMario> @PlagueOfGripes Can't you pupm some CO there and suffocate it slowly and nicely?
[4:36:34] <arkv01> can you get em with a net?
[4:36:35] <psychosid64> BRUH THATS FUCKD!
[4:36:36] <+StreamStopA> I thought it was funny
[4:36:36] <+ziplockfriday> get a gas axe
[4:36:37] <$sleepy_coffee> Oh man that’s shitty
[4:36:38] <Gavaline> I still like it more than the remake's story at least
[4:36:41] <silverpoyozo> let`s get back to talking about Tifa's muscles
[4:36:41] <cloudyg3> :(
[4:36:47] <happyface699> It’s informative
[4:36:53] <NireFuster> Went from being horny about muscles to cats dying
[4:36:55] <happyface699> It’s fucked still
[4:36:59] <NireFuster> 0 to 100
[4:37:31] <weatherreport240> how long has the kitten been in there?
[4:37:49] <Lord_Siking> depression and arousal are very close
[4:38:01] <arkv01> BibleThump
[4:38:08] <psychosid64> Title of Stream:Come watch my Childhood Die(And talk about dying Kittens)
[4:38:09] <silverpoyozo> :(
[4:38:12] <NireFuster> gets to the kitten but it just scratches and slashes away at your face cause it's wild LUL LUL
[4:38:29] <Pencildragon> poor kitten
[4:38:31] <KaiserMario> "couple of days" huh? So, pretty much nothing to do...
[4:38:32] <arkv01> can you bat at it with a very long stick and catch it with a net or soft surface?
[4:38:38] <NireFuster> @lord_siking very true
[4:38:47] <weatherreport240> Plague must slay the ghost kittens!
[4:38:54] <Gavaline> Canon protecting npcs to protect the canon ghosts
[4:38:54] <vonmaultke> From what little i have seen those Ghosts get stupider
[4:38:58] <saddlezilla1> Eligor?
[4:39:08] <arkv01> oh yeah the graveyard guy
[4:39:09] <BrachyZoid> LUL
[4:39:24] <happyface699> We must fight them all
[4:39:25] <arkv01> aeris is into that ghost porn
[4:39:30] <KaiserMario> Yeah, I'd just gas the thing, it would be less torture than starvation
[4:40:03] <BrachyZoid> jesus, so many Matt Mercers
[4:40:08] <NireFuster> can't you seal off the thing to prevent stupid animals to commit suicide by getting in there??
[4:40:08] <JohnClaggart> the name of the enemy was an eligor
[4:40:13] <psychosid64> yo it's 1:39am. I need to stop getting high and watching Twitch LolzXD I'm never sleeping
[4:40:16] <terminusterminal> Paid in exposure
[4:40:18] <LordFalara> we killed six bugs the town is saved
[4:40:22] <sosuke5> SeemsGood
[4:40:27] <LordFalara> its not like insects are persistent and numerous
[4:40:33] <happyface699> Thanks Charlie sheen
[4:40:36] <LordFalara> gone forever
[4:40:36] <@Nightbot> Plague is a youtube animator and also streams at https://picarto.tv/Plague . Also: t-shirts! http://goo.gl/lze8QO
[4:40:40] <LordFalara> no more bugs
[4:40:43] <+unclekulikov> EXPOSURE
[4:40:47] <arkv01> here comes the seizures again
[4:40:56] <JohnClaggart> and it will look very stupid if they put that half chariot reaper horse into remake
[4:41:08] <happyface699> HES JUST FUCKING CHARLIE SHEEN
[4:41:11] <jiin6> he stabbed one guy one time
[4:41:13] <saddlezilla1> I'm sure he murdered some guards on his way into the city
[4:41:14] <NireFuster> "we've been through a lot" LUL LUL LUL
[4:41:20] <NireFuster> sure thing Cloud
[4:41:21] <laguerrilha> he also did some pocking with it
[4:41:27] <arkv01> yeah wedge, let them procreate!
[4:41:30] <ClaymoreJesus> let me date Biggs already
[4:41:31] <silverpoyozo> good wingman
[4:41:40] <NireFuster> He just drags it to Midgard in CC
[4:41:43] <arkv01> biggs is TOO hot in this remake
[4:41:47] <NireFuster> doesn't swing it yet
[4:41:50] <Pencildragon> biggs wingmanning cloud
[4:41:53] <CyberDingus> Biggs is very bishie
[4:41:56] <twenty112> Hey! That's that guy who killed 6 whole bugs!
[4:42:02] <smugfox95> He forgot about how angry he was real fast
[4:42:06] <Security_Jack> Anyone know of a good way to support Plague sans cash?
[4:42:19] <+Nephthyz> Cloud is a little bitch, so it only makes sense.
[4:42:26] <Gavaline> Yeah, but to be fair, Cloud has been acting like a little bitch
[4:42:30] <laguerrilha> well Cloud is still a little bitch
[4:42:35] <Pencildragon> get the bat with nails in it Kappa
[4:42:41] <dowmein> punk ass bitch
[4:42:46] <arkv01> wow, bulletproof vest WOULD be useful
[4:42:55] <saddlezilla1> And the flailing. don't forget the arm flailing to emphasize his point of you being a little bitch
[4:42:55] <happyface699> Punk ass bitch toooo BADASS in 2 min
[4:43:02] <Coystick> "here enjoy this less-cool looking sword"
[4:43:21] <arkv01> gimme that jojo stone mask
[4:43:27] <Magpiejake> magic defence
[4:43:29] <KaiserMario> Magic DEF
[4:43:42] <happyface699> @arkv01 God I want one
[4:43:48] <NotLysander> PC port had some sort of issue like that
[4:43:48] <Pencildragon> somebody's trying to become a vampire
[4:43:50] <Security_Jack> Roger that. Enjoyed your work for a long time.
[4:43:59] <RykerSkies> iirc it was chance to dodge magic attacks
[4:44:04] <hexacockadrom> Magic Defense didn’t work
[4:44:19] <psychosid64> @plagueofgripes am I dumb for mistaking Shark Robo(Shopping website) for Game Shark(Cheat Code Device)
[4:44:33] <JohnClaggart> good for bosses i guess
[4:44:41] <Pencildragon> every game is just slowly becoming dark souls Kappa
[4:44:42] <Security_Jack> So, give on to Aeright ASAP.
[4:44:46] <Gavaline> So phoenix downs are gone then?
[4:44:51] <Security_Jack> Aerith*
[4:44:52] <NotLysander> But takes the accessory slot
[4:44:52] <KaiserMario> The most useful Dark Souls item
[4:45:01] <arkv01> we still have phoenix downs
[4:45:02] <silverpoyozo> @Security_Jack Oh you!
[4:45:18] <law240> moe slots
[4:45:23] <LordFalara> it also depends on if you can swap equips in battle
[4:45:25] <hexacockadrom> dArK sOuLs ReFeReNcE
[4:45:27] <JohnClaggart> the materia trainer
[4:45:31] <LordFalara> if not its worthless
[4:45:40] <KaiserMario> But the stats are much worse
[4:45:43] <thetopazking> same price as a phoenix down maybe same regen equivalent
[4:45:53] <JohnClaggart> you didnt look at the weapons
[4:46:00] <LordFalara> oh shit are you going to stream the whole game?
[4:46:06] <NotLysander> FF9?
[4:46:11] <law240> it rubs off on you
[4:46:30] <saddlezilla1> Aka you can now viably use the Buster Sword for the full game
[4:46:39] <law240> i mean by then it'll just be the moves
[4:46:41] <LordFalara> hooray!
[4:46:45] <BrachyZoid> I apologize but I'm collapsing atm. You all keep having fun!
[4:46:48] <KaiserMario> I'm waiting for that Whirligig Sword on part 2
[4:46:52] <BrachyZoid> lunarLove
[4:47:04] <BrachyZoid> Looks doubtful
[4:47:10] <KaiserMario> You can grind soon
[4:47:11] <JohnClaggart> just about, gotta talk to OC boy first
[4:47:16] <Magpiejake> i dont think so
[4:47:18] <happyface699> It’s gon be long
[4:47:20] <law240> you won't really need to cause the missions give you a lot to fight
[4:47:35] <NireFuster> it's 5:46 am here so I'm gonna mosey cuz I need the sleep, y'all have fun though, good luck plague
[4:47:44] <NireFuster> good night chat
[4:47:51] <happyface699> Tifa so horny
[4:47:52] <thetopazking> there are side quests that can only be done in this chapter and they take some time
[4:47:57] <Magpiejake> max just cleared chapter 4 and he didnt seem to find any areas like that
[4:47:59] <+drsaltneo> This would be where you grind, do the sidequests, they give you access to an area with enemies
[4:48:02] <happyface699> Night @nirefuster
[4:48:24] <psychosid64> ok it's 1:47am so I'mma go to sleep now that I'm not high anymore lol
[4:48:25] <law240> jobs give you a lot to fight
[4:48:25] <happyface699> I’m probably gonna head out soon since it’s 4:48 am here
[4:48:25] <laguerrilha> she know your version isnt real
[4:48:32] <Gavaline> She knows Cloud isn't Soldier, but not the details
[4:48:34] <psychosid64> goodnight everyone
[4:48:38] <saddlezilla1> In the OG she starts to doubt her own version.
[4:48:47] <saddlezilla1> She's not sure what's the truth
[4:48:53] <LordFalara> @plagueofgripes she knows he wasnt soldier and was acting like a diffrent person
[4:48:59] <Huntercd> In the original, she knows cloud wasn't it soldier
[4:49:03] <arkv01> he just keeps screaming IMMA SOULJAA
[4:49:06] <law240> They'll touch on it more in story instants
[4:49:06] <KaiserMario> she sees you as a regular grunt, but not a soldier, at Nippleheim
[4:49:06] <happyface699> Yeh I’m out night everyone
[4:49:12] <LordFalara> thats about it, she figures out more at kalm but says nothing
[4:49:32] <jiin6> NERD
[4:49:38] <impartialcredit> over 9000
[4:49:41] <arkv01> FUCK YOU toriyama
[4:49:42] <Pencildragon> CHAD
[4:49:45] <laguerrilha> CHAD
[4:49:46] <terminusterminal> You don't deserve the name Chad.
[4:49:47] <vonmaultke> dodMiss Anime Trash
[4:49:48] <KaiserMario> FUCK THIS GUY
[4:49:48] <terminusterminal> Discard it
[4:49:52] <jiin6> CHADLEE
[4:49:57] <jiin6> monocle
[4:50:01] <+unclekulikov> He's got the Google Glass
[4:50:02] <Gavaline> CHAD's shitty younger brother Chadley
[4:50:09] <CyberDingus> HELLO I AM A CHILD AND I AM SMART
[4:50:13] <saddlezilla1> @Huntercd that's actually never touched on. She just knows he wasn't at Nibelheim. But eventually starts to doubt her own memories cuz of how much Cloud's story makes sense.
[4:50:14] <silverpoyozo> Hope you can bully this little asshole
[4:50:15] <KaiserMario> 100% Nomura's diahrrea
[4:50:16] <TheWe4pon> is that a fucking monocle?
[4:50:20] <arkv01> AND KILL A CHILD?
[4:50:22] <arkv01> holy shit kid
[4:50:23] <Maids4lyfe> LUL
[4:50:24] <jiin6> Kill Child
[4:50:27] <LordPubious> poindexter!
[4:50:27] <law240> yes
[4:50:29] <vonmaultke> I do
[4:50:29] <KaiserMario> No, but yes
[4:50:32] <Apolonm> yes
[4:50:34] <+StreamStopA> I hate him
[4:50:34] <jiin6> i think its intent
[4:50:35] <Explodincatz> i do
[4:50:36] <Maids4lyfe> no but yes
[4:50:37] <Gavaline> They must
[4:50:41] <%caramello_man> japan loves him
[4:50:42] <Pencildragon> I think Cloud hates him and that is how you are supposed to feel
[4:50:42] <smugfox95> Now THAT'S motivation
[4:50:44] <saddlezilla1> I have no strong feelings
[4:50:45] <arkv01> I can SMELL toriyama all over this
[4:51:09] <arkv01> I pretend to be an innocent shota and fuck yo wives
[4:51:10] <+Nephthyz> Someone should beat this kid to death.
[4:51:13] <KaiserMario> @caramello_man shut up they love him! No they can't!
[4:51:17] <jiin6> first time in japan ever
[4:51:22] <Explodincatz> no plague dont stop
[4:51:31] <hexacockadrom> Chadley the Virgin
[4:51:34] <vonmaultke> Japanese tropes are starting to smell their own farts
[4:51:37] <hexacockadrom> LUL
[4:51:38] <Murphio_GS> Japanese tropes can be rather obnoxious
[4:51:42] <kiwicoffin> they just can't help themselves
[4:51:45] <LordPubious> Weevil Underwood
[4:51:46] <LordFalara> i hope he specifically dies when the pillar falls.
[4:51:47] <saddlezilla1> i feel like chadley was designed by someone who didn't understand why ppl liked 9S
[4:51:56] <silverpoyozo> LUL LUL
[4:51:56] <KaiserMario> yeah, kids are dumb
[4:51:57] <jiin6> in Gamera that kid died
[4:51:58] <smugfox95> Have the japanese ever met a child?
[4:52:12] <Maids4lyfe> given Japan's birthrate, the answer is no
[4:52:12] <jiin6> @smugfox95 low birth rates
[4:52:12] <vonmaultke> Your harsh and realistic
[4:52:13] <Gavaline> Because they need to push up those replacement level kid figures
[4:52:17] <Coystick> I was born crotchety
[4:52:18] <cyberblueneon> yeah, most protagonists in japanese games are anime are teenagers or kids
[4:52:18] <hexacockadrom> Hate children
[4:52:23] <+Nephthyz> It's because children are super dumb and incompetent.
[4:52:29] <Pencildragon> I don't like the obsession with high school in Japanese media. The further I get away from HS the less I relate to it lol.
[4:52:38] <weatherreport240> maybe because it's 100% untrue?
[4:52:46] <JohnClaggart> probably the air of superiority rubs you the wrong way despite there being none
[4:52:51] <+StreamStopA> why do children rub you the wrong way plague
[4:52:53] <law240> 2 Birds with one stone
[4:52:54] <KaiserMario> @PlagueOfGripes I find hilarious that japanese think that children are super capable, only to then steal their whole childhood with a depressing and opressive school system
[4:53:05] <silverpoyozo> even his voice is obnoxious
[4:53:11] <laguerrilha> what about the anime teens that excels in combat against people that trained for decades?
[4:53:12] <law240> yes
[4:53:14] <Explodincatz> its scan
[4:53:14] <twenty112> Yes
[4:53:15] <Maids4lyfe> yes
[4:53:15] <Gavaline> Seems like it
[4:53:16] <law240> it's SCAN
[4:53:28] <arkv01> kids are pretty horrible
[4:53:30] <hexacockadrom> Probably scan
[4:53:36] <Sunstalker> Watch the scan be capable of failing LUL
[4:53:42] <+Spiggerus> aspergers
[4:53:44] <saddlezilla1> @Pencildragon apparently it's to do w/ their harsh work ethic when they graduate. HS ends up feeling like their last period of freedom is what I've heard.
[4:53:47] <Maids4lyfe> children are vile and full of evil
[4:53:47] <LordFalara> need sleep have work zzzz
[4:53:47] <Murphio_GS> Same honestly
[4:53:48] <%caramello_man> @KaiserMario you obviously know nothing about japan then mate, they LOVE that shota dick
[4:53:59] <Explodincatz> because shut up
[4:54:01] <+Nephthyz> I've been cursed with eternally looking and sounding like I'm 15 years old, so I've got the exact opposite issue.
[4:54:03] <law240> it's the same shit
[4:54:07] <KaiserMario> @caramello_man yeah... they do...
[4:54:08] <Murphio_GS> Other kids hated me but I could get along fine with adults
[4:54:13] <saddlezilla1> was scan a bad translation??
[4:54:15] <LordPubious> slid out of the womb with a grimace on your face
[4:54:17] <grander76> i thought it was sense
[4:54:24] <vonmaultke> Because they think they have learnt everything and have all the answers
[4:54:30] <Gavaline> Maybe scan will be a permanently learnable weapon skill instead?
[4:54:35] <JohnClaggart> you got a side quest for rats
[4:54:37] <law240> cause you are actually assessing your opponent
[4:54:53] <Pencildragon> @saddlezilla1 yeah I've heard something like that before
[4:55:00] <Murphio_GS> Orb of assess
[4:55:12] <mr_slaide> They named it assess because they knew it would mildly annoy you.
[4:55:19] <+Nephthyz> I'd be so happy if this kid turned out to be a Goblin or some other shit that you have to murder.
[4:55:20] <law240> ASSESS?
[4:55:26] <Maids4lyfe> you still have to Assess
[4:55:35] <silverpoyozo> divekick
[4:55:37] <Maids4lyfe> LUL
[4:55:37] <law240> you have to use it
[4:55:39] <Pencildragon> this battle theme still slaps
[4:55:51] <jiin6> yes
[4:55:52] <+sourceofall> either
[4:55:53] <mr_slaide> Btw, make sure to always start with assessing monsters. Always.
[4:56:11] <Tornadobear> rats rats we're the rats, celebrating yet another birthday bash
[4:56:11] <mr_slaide> Ehhhh... Sure.
[4:56:12] <+sal00nn> Just a hybrid of rat and man
[4:56:12] <law240> you miss some monsters
[4:56:15] <impartialcredit> rat that turns into a rat
[4:56:15] <Artista_AF> is a Rat that turns into a bigger rat
[4:56:16] <vonmaultke> I love hating on this remake dodCool its so good yet so shit
[4:56:17] <law240> can*
[4:56:24] <JohnClaggart> tifa's stack system requires the use of her skills
[4:56:24] <dowmein> I'd like to Assess Tifa, nowammsayn
[4:56:29] <Tornadobear> The giant rat that makes all of the rules
[4:56:32] <Coystick> She kickko
[4:56:34] <saddlezilla1> Tifa just drags the monster corpses back to 7th heaven & tells Cloud not to let slip it's what she uses for cooking...
[4:56:35] <JohnClaggart> thats why she gains atb faster
[4:56:43] <cyberblueneon> i prefer 8, 9, and 10 battle themes, 6 is meh though
[4:57:27] <mr_slaide> Tifa is very good on fights that don't last like 20 seconds...
[4:57:28] <Pencildragon> 10's battle theme is really great
[4:57:35] <Artista_AF> true but screw that animal for stealing my shit
[4:57:49] <mr_slaide> Still ATB.
[4:58:08] <Maids4lyfe> magic
[4:58:13] <law240> Staff means magic
[4:58:19] <jiin6> magic attacks
[4:58:25] <+Campfire_Chronicles> just means weak to "cold magic"
[4:58:28] <Dutchpotato> U can check icons with L1
[4:58:56] <KaiserMario> FF fauna
[4:58:57] <jiin6> Rats are pests
[4:59:01] <arkv01> just royal rats
[4:59:06] <jiin6> human is food
[4:59:12] <twenty112> Larger than average animals WutFace
[4:59:14] <Pencildragon> just killing the local wildlife, nothing to see here Kappa
[4:59:16] <mr_slaide> Nope.
[4:59:18] <law240> nope
[4:59:35] <saddlezilla1> how many of these rats do u think the slum dwellers eat weekly?
[4:59:42] <law240> Uppercut into dropkick
[4:59:43] <mr_slaide> All of them.
[5:00:05] <twenty112> It got her killed lol
[5:00:08] <Huntercd> Was that a Dempsey roll?
[5:00:10] <mr_slaide> No, it does recharge a small amount of of hp and cure poison, it's kinda useless at low level.
[5:00:33] <+Campfire_Chronicles> mostly useful for curing poison at this point I think
[5:00:33] <%caramello_man> @PlagueOfGripes do people revive at the end of battles?
[5:00:44] <law240> Chakra heals the damage you've taken based on you'e HP
[5:00:47] <@Nightbot> Plague is a youtube animator and also streams at https://picarto.tv/Plague . Also: t-shirts! http://goo.gl/lze8QO
[5:00:51] <mihokspawn> Chadley, how much of a douche name can you have?
[5:00:53] <KaiserMario> One of my favorite things about 15, is that the fauna has a place in it, there's a bit of an ecosystem in place
[5:00:54] <mr_slaide> Yeah, Tifa is a beast.
[5:00:55] <Huntercd> His name is Chadley? Really?
[5:01:06] <+dumemoto> How dare you almost cause VORE CLOUD
[5:01:12] <+Nephthyz> That just makes me think of all those dumb Broly memes.
[5:01:31] <law240> For Tifa Uppercut into Dropkick is SUPER GOOD
[5:01:32] <+Nephthyz> Like how everyone was calling him Chadly when he was announced as being canon.
[5:01:45] <mr_slaide> It kinda sucks early on.
[5:01:56] <Explodincatz> why chackra when u can just potion
[5:02:09] <Explodincatz> all FF games throw a billion potions at you
[5:02:37] <mr_slaide> Chakra is better the more HP the char has, potions are static.
[5:02:51] <+Campfire_Chronicles> @PlagueOfGripes basically its bad as a top-off but its a useful heal when you need it, most of the time tifa should be focusing on offense
[5:02:57] <Pencildragon> percent vs flat value
[5:03:04] <mr_slaide> ^
[5:03:14] <mr_slaide> He's such a nerd.
[5:03:19] <arkv01> kid said we can kill him, lets take up his offer
[5:03:20] <SonofStranger> I've only heard him talk for 8 seconds and I already hate him
[5:03:21] <Gerelos> Kill him! KILL HIM!
[5:03:23] <Admiralpoosh> I hate his voice so much
[5:03:23] <+Nephthyz> His dialog is super stilted, too. I could see why you would, he's just poorly written.
[5:03:47] <mr_slaide> Yop.
[5:03:59] <saddlezilla1> He's be infinitely better if he was depressed and mad as hell because Shinra made him wear that shitty outfit.
[5:04:06] <mr_slaide> Basically.
[5:04:14] <+Campfire_Chronicles> @PlagueOfGripes also using her power-up is super good cuz then you can combo multiple triangle attacks into each other for big big damage
[5:04:16] <mr_slaide> Also cures poison.
[5:04:23] <law240> Tifa gets ATB fast
[5:04:26] <SonofStranger> why does he have a random scarf on his shoulder?
[5:04:26] <JohnClaggart> it's good on tifa with her faster atb
[5:04:38] <twenty112> Are any of Chadley's design elements actually relevant to his character? Or is it just random shit stuck to him? He looks like a Soul Caliber create-a-character
[5:04:45] <JohnClaggart> but she can also use potions faster with the atb gain
[5:04:46] <+Jonesman64> chadlet
[5:04:47] <mr_slaide> How's it feels, Chadley, to be a... bitch?
[5:05:00] <+Jonesman64> i dont see the point to the weapon reset...
[5:05:10] <law240> Optimize for the SP you have
[5:05:17] <law240> for what you need
[5:05:36] <jiin6> SP's tied to your level
[5:05:53] <mr_slaide> It basically auto-cast cures without you asking for it.
[5:05:59] <JohnClaggart> it's for the AI to cure you
[5:06:02] <+Jonesman64> its lazy cure
[5:06:04] <+Campfire_Chronicles> lets your secondary characters cast cure without you having to manually do it
[5:06:05] <jiin6> the AI auto cures you
[5:06:06] <Gavaline> Have the AI cure for you
[5:06:10] <+Jonesman64> so kind of useless
[5:06:20] <+forgetme000> its auto heal
[5:06:32] <KaiserMario> You give it to the AI so you don't have to bother
[5:06:42] <mr_slaide> No, that's pretty much the case.
[5:06:43] <kiwicoffin> It's possible an enemy blows out your ally while you're fighting a different one
[5:06:45] <arkv01> lazy susan cure
[5:06:45] <SonofStranger> well people complain about turn based mechanics so I suppose that gamers are just too impatient
[5:06:46] <law240> You might need it later for when it get crazy
[5:06:47] <mr_slaide> It's for lazy assholes.
[5:06:50] <+DaRyeBeachHood> good for Aerith
[5:06:56] <+Dreday543> Good Morning Plague
[5:06:59] <JohnClaggart> you also might be out of range in a battle or something
[5:07:09] <saddlezilla1> for the player who only wants to use shortcuts i guess?
[5:07:24] <law240> idk
[5:07:30] <Zohare> It does not
[5:07:32] <KaiserMario> idk
[5:07:44] <jiin6> split?
[5:07:47] <arkv01> how does this kid 'develop' materia?
[5:07:56] <+DaRyeBeachHood> gotta get all the Huge Materia 10 years from now in part 3
[5:07:57] <arkv01> now that clodd, I like
[5:08:03] <Pencildragon> I thought materia was hardened mako?
[5:08:03] <terminusterminal> Still getting paid in exposure....
[5:08:05] <jiin6> NETWORK CLOUD
[5:08:15] <twenty112> HOO BOY
[5:08:18] <mr_slaide> Jiin6, back in FFVII, when a materia maxed in level ,it gave you a unleveled copy. Pretty good to get rare materias like summons for more than 1 character.
[5:08:22] <law240> DO JOBS
[5:08:34] <arkv01> yeah I thought materia was made naturally
[5:08:43] <law240> the jobs are on the map
[5:08:43] <Coystick> Tifa pls quest to lick tummy
[5:08:52] <jiin6> summons don't have lvls tho...
[5:08:52] <KaiserMario> Open menu
[5:09:05] <Sunstalker> Asses
[5:09:05] <Gavaline> Assess
[5:09:05] <Maids4lyfe> assess
[5:09:08] <+Jonesman64> Battle Intel missions
[5:09:08] <mr_slaide> Yop.
[5:09:13] <law240> he works on battle intel
[5:09:18] <twenty112> Assesssssss
[5:09:21] <+Jonesman64> which you can find in the menu
[5:09:25] <SonofStranger> assass
[5:09:26] <arkv01> ass haha 69
[5:09:27] <KaiserMario> You can now do some "achievements" to unlock upgrades
[5:09:31] <Explodincatz> u do mini quests in fights
[5:09:37] <mr_slaide> No.
[5:09:41] <+Campfire_Chronicles> @PlagueOfGripes battle intel is basically missions you gotta complete like "stagger 5 enemies" for example
[5:09:41] <SonofStranger> try it?
[5:09:43] <jiin6> look it up
[5:09:49] <mr_slaide> Different enemies.
[5:09:50] <JohnClaggart> unique scans i think
[5:09:56] <arkv01> oh fuck is this monster arena?
[5:10:12] <jiin6> no this is hidden missions
[5:10:15] <$sleepy_coffee> Maybe it upgrades into scan/analyze
[5:10:32] <+Campfire_Chronicles> the stagger ones are hard to do early
[5:10:35] <law240> if you go to the bar there is an instants
[5:10:55] <arkv01> fill up my atb capn
[5:10:59] <KaiserMario> Wait
[5:11:08] <KaiserMario> Go to lady with big number panel
[5:11:21] <law240> green makers ae jobs
[5:11:24] <arkv01> that lady uh
[5:11:27] <arkv01> just copped a feel on tifa
[5:11:29] <mr_slaide> Certain spells fill the stagger bar very fast for certain enemies, like aero for certain flying enemies. Assess does help you warning which.
[5:11:35] <mr_slaide> MUH QUEEN
[5:11:44] <arkv01> he does NOT sell rubbers
[5:11:53] <arkv01> because premarital sex is NOT ALLOWED
[5:11:58] <Gavaline> No way - he's keeping it all for himself
[5:12:04] <Frankomancer> is your first quesy literally to kill rats in a basement? NO IT CANT BE
[5:12:10] <Coystick> He sold all the sex to pay for that haircut
[5:12:17] <mr_slaide> Well, it's not technically a basement.
[5:12:17] <law240> it's a job
[5:12:32] <mr_slaide> Yop.
[5:12:46] <Explodincatz> even better
[5:12:49] <Coystick> Yeeees
[5:12:52] <mr_slaide> Kinda...

[5:16:28] <%bettysharkface> Yeah the mouth is...wide...
[5:16:31] <+Jonesman64> bad case of muppet mouth
[5:16:32] <+Nephthyz> Look at his mouth, it looks like deformed rubber stretching over itself.
[5:16:37] <Frankomancer> oh i assumed by junk dealer it meant drugs, not literal junk
[5:16:45] <vonmaultke> Fucking Chadley, destiny plot ghosts LUL i can't get over how stupid this is
[5:16:45] <Pencildragon> it almost looks like his teeth and lips were moving independently of each other

[5:17:12] <mihokspawn> @PlagueOfGripes its a discount
[5:17:13] <Explodincatz> how much HE has
[5:17:14] <jiin6> what they have
[5:17:14] <Gavaline> How many he has
[5:17:15] <+sourceofall> for some things
[5:17:16] <+Jonesman64> its on sale
[5:17:16] <+wolf34736> his stock
[5:17:18] <+Campfire_Chronicles> they have infinite so its empty
[5:17:19] <arkv01> makes sense, these are the slums
[5:17:20] <Maids4lyfe> yes shops run out
[5:17:20] <law240> the percentage of stock
[5:17:21] <weatherreport240> what's with mouth tracking recently? It seems bad here, and it was terrible in RE3
[5:17:28] <+Campfire_Chronicles> he only has 1 ether,
[5:17:34] <JohnClaggart> down percentage is discounted because you accepted the quest
[5:17:35] <+sourceofall> he has infinite potions
[5:17:40] <+sourceofall> he has 1 ether
[5:17:42] <+Campfire_Chronicles> he has 1 ether and infinite potions
[5:17:42] <mihokspawn> @PlagueOfGripes the sotck is for discounted items
[5:17:43] <KaiserMario> Buy an ether
[5:17:44] <arkv01> ok SOME items are limited
[5:17:44] <law240> he only has 1 ether
[5:17:45] <+Nephthyz> He has 1 Ether and infinite potions.
[5:17:46] <Gavaline> Probably if no stock number, means they have infinite amount
[5:17:48] <TheLucidChiba> Assumed infinite stock I guess
[5:17:49] <Pencildragon> empty is infinite? 0 is none?
[5:17:52] <+TheDragonOfTheBlackPool> unlimited stock?
[5:17:53] <+wolf34736> if it doesn't have a number it is infinite
[5:17:59] <CyberDingus> @PlagueOfGripes YES
[5:18:12] <KaiserMario> yeah, it would help
[5:18:17] <Explodincatz> would help yea

[5:18:59] <mr_slaide> Stock means he has a limited amount. No amount written in stock means he has an unlimited amount. % down means it's a discount price.
[5:19:00] <Pencildragon> LOL west coast chocobo

[5:22:47] <Bizerco> You could also wake up if you sleep, ever think of that? @sourceofall
[5:22:51] <Bizerco> Maybe we are all sleeping.
