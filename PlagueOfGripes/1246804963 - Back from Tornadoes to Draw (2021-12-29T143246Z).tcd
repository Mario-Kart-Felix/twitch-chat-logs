[0:29:28] <DougintheTrench> Funky Baba Yaga
[0:29:30] <%Scarnehu> catra or Eda?
[0:29:31] <Mizaiya> iirc
[0:29:45] <%JovianGargoyle> Demona from gargoyles
[0:29:54] <%KellBeII> is this the dark souls character creator music?  its pretty low
[0:29:59] <%Scarnehu> also an excellent choice
[0:30:01] <cartakus> Sure
[0:30:02] <%KellBeII> oh man i love re4s save theme
[0:30:08] <DougintheTrench> Oh, we're back to Nier music I see Kappa
[0:30:09] <MattRX> Is that Demona?
[0:30:09] <Maids4lyfe> yeah I can kinda hear it
[0:30:13] <warandpens> Plague, do you have a favorite character designer you take inspiration from?
[0:30:14] <%KellBeII> re4 has aa super underrated soundtrack in general
[0:30:16] <%JovianGargoyle> I also would've accepted Wuya.
[0:30:34] <%Scarnehu> yeah, i could get that. similar flavor to it
[0:30:34] <cerazor01> Ah yes
[0:30:59] <cerazor01> my favourite re4 track. used only in that one underground water passage.
[0:31:08] <cartakus> It will be the bedt thing ever
[0:31:09] <Coystick> There is no such thing as an Elden Ring
[0:31:12] <NireFuster> Yeah the Dark Souls character creator music has a very similar tune to RE4's save theme
[0:31:16] <Vlad_Tech> It can't be the best thing ever, that title belongs to sliced bread.
[0:31:19] <%JoshManVGH> And jumping!
[0:31:19] <DougintheTrench> Haven't seen anything about Elden Ring other than that first teaser
[0:31:28] <%KellBeII> from whaat Franz has been saying, its put a slight damper on my excitement for it
[0:31:31] <Coystick> At least there's jumping as well to breakup rollspam
[0:31:33] <%Scarnehu> loving the new emotes btw
[0:31:33] <theloganbrand> Best thing ever that you get chewed alive if you talk critically about it for a week to a month
[0:31:42] <cerazor01> oh right
[0:31:45] <Maids4lyfe> I love grapes
[0:31:46] <%criticalink_> The return of poise and the shield changes are nice.
[0:31:48] <cerazor01> Elden Ring is out right?
[0:31:51] <cartakus> I really wanna try a tower shield plus ultra greatsword
[0:31:55] <%JoshManVGH> With the weapon skills, PCP is going to look goofy.

[0:37:55] <SirSaki> Shadow of the colosus still has one of the coolest titles for its whole soundtrac: Roar of the Earth
[0:37:57] <DougintheTrench> Still need to play SotC
[0:38:33] <DougintheTrench> Not just the remake, haven't played the og either
[0:38:35] <drusef64> demona, the most subtle name ever

[0:39:12] <Coystick> Star Siege run 2 when?
[0:39:14] <+Axellogic> unfortunately yeah
[0:39:22] <DougintheTrench> Sometimes
[0:39:27] <Vlad_Tech> No. *closes tab of old CRPG music*
[0:39:34] <drusef64> @boltman_37 Demona
[0:39:35] <SirSaki> If you're on PS4 the remake is on sale for $10 right now @DougintheTrench
[0:39:43] <Coystick> Might & Magic 8 OST
[0:39:49] <+PleasantLee> oooh yes. I would never press random without earphones in on my playlists
[0:39:53] <boltman_37> the disgaea ost
[0:40:02] <DougintheTrench> Especially old music, if not just need to wait a few more years and I'll be the only one left I feel
[0:40:03] <+Nepycros> @boltman_37 Antagonist of the Gargoyles cartoon from the... late 90's? Early 00's?
[0:40:15] <Graahdicus> i still remember playing Starsiege tribes back in the day with my cousin
[0:40:20] <+Nepycros> Apparently there's a live action remake coming out?
[0:40:24] <+Nepycros> I'm not feeling it.
[0:40:29] <%octotasty> looong tail
[0:40:44] <SirSaki> The World Ends With You,  Ridge Racer and the viewtiful Joe soundtrack
[0:40:46] <drusef64> what that tail do?
[0:41:01] <Mizaiya> for me its the Custom Robo for the Gamecube ost
[0:41:41] <DougintheTrench> Feels like a speak & spell walked into church blasting 2010's Ozzy Osbourne Music
[0:41:44] <+Nepycros> There was a weird Czech RPS card game in 2014 with a really nice ambient track. It went offline a year later, but I still think about the music.
[0:41:53] <DougintheTrench> Yes that's very specific I know
[0:41:55] <+Nepycros> I've tried reaching out to the devs to get the original tracks. No luck. :/
[0:42:48] <+Nepycros> Apart from that, the only niche music I listen to would have to be from the first Bionicle flash game. Such bangers.
[0:43:38] <%cosmicleviathan18> Anyone here play Bannerlord? hat game had great music
[0:43:38] <boltman_37> Cheer100 Cheer100 Cheer100 Cheer100 Cheer100  hope you're doing well, missed ya

[0:44:46] <%JoshManVGH> Been looking around my area, we have one here that looks like it used to be a small church.
[0:45:00] <%KellBeII> are you trying to escape kentucky or just find somewhere slightly less rural?
[0:45:10] <%JoshManVGH> So you leave the living room and walk out onto a stage dancehall thing.
[0:45:11] <+PleasantLee> number 1 EliMcBiggestDong Road
[0:45:23] <Mizaiya> wait is this a Gargoyles character?
[0:45:27] <+Axellogic> I'm prolly the only person sitting here listening to the Utawarerumono ost
[0:45:31] <%JoshManVGH> Demona!
[0:45:50] <+Axellogic> Everyone always scared of underwater ray romano
[0:45:56] <%KellBeII> plagueEggs
[0:46:08] <Mizaiya> @JoshManVGH oh shit it is
[0:46:14] <+Nepycros> Oh god the eggs gotta be that big though? D:

[0:46:36] <+PleasantLee> RaccAttack plagueEggs
[0:46:58] <+enpassantpassader> any insights after replaying ff7?
[0:47:08] <%JovianGargoyle> I remembered them loading garg eggs into a cart one at at time because they were the size of pigs.
[0:47:22] <theloganbrand> It was nice that it was one of those things you might consider 'nostalgic'
[0:47:34] <%KellBeII> kinda like demons souls remake music

[0:47:39] <%daveronald> daveronald gifted a Tier 1 sub to Solid_Stro! 
[0:48:08] <+Axellogic> I think I liked the aibuster version of the boss theme cause it was the closest to the original with its instramentation
[0:48:13] <Graahdicus> sounds like they might have wanted to repurpose them for FF14
[0:48:19] <SirSaki> Remakes have to dance a really fine line these days. They gotta either be better than the original or be along the same level as the original
[0:48:26] <%Heart0fInk> I get the feeling with a lot of FF7 that was lost in remake was the feeling of grunginess, even in the music.
[0:48:33] <+Traximus_V> gift subs. I dodge those
[0:49:19] <%lifeofnotorious> Hey plague, I subbed while you were offline. I'm a fan of you being your normal self, as well as the farmer plague character in your videos. I play your FF10 video over and over riooLaugh
[0:49:29] <+Axellogic> I still dont like how Wall Markets theme was just given to some mooks instead of being the music of a seedy town
[0:49:55] <%JovianGargoyle> There was a parade.
[0:49:55] <+PleasantLee> we were thinking
[0:50:01] <+Axellogic> The music they replaced it with didnt have the same tone
[0:50:04] <%Spadoinkle> Morning Plague. Hope your well.

[0:51:15] <Mizaiya> the reference image is just an actual gargoyle on the side of a building

[0:53:31] <el_flako_killer> Please do.
[0:53:33] <%Heart0fInk> An LP of Dark Souls 2 Kappa b
[0:53:50] <dybia> Gotta remind people you exist. Its why a bunch of artists end up doing either a podcast or an LP channel
[0:53:54] <+Axellogic> I wish Utawarerumono wasnt 90% VN and 10% tactical rpg or id try to get people to play it.
[0:53:55] <KakePews> Said every creator ever, every single day.
[0:53:55] <Coystick> High Charity...
[0:54:13] <cartakus> boo
[0:54:19] <%JamesCorck> Silent Hill or any of them
[0:54:30] <el_flako_killer> An RPG?
[0:54:30] <KakePews> DS2 confirmed Poggers
[0:54:32] <%daveronald> lol
[0:54:44] <+Axellogic> I like money too
[0:54:45] <Graahdicus> @PlagueOfGripes i wouldnt mind seeing you do Code Vein for S and Gs
[0:54:54] <+Axellogic> Pay me I can type in chat
[0:54:59] <+Axellogic> >:V
[0:55:05] <%KellBeII> wort wort wort
[0:55:23] <%JoshManVGH> Admittedly i bet the sponsered ad bits would be pretty great.
[0:55:27] <%daveronald> that would be pog
[0:55:29] <%JovianGargoyle> Waifus, there's a reason
[0:55:29] <Graahdicus> OOT has been done to deat IMO
[0:55:34] <Graahdicus> death*
[0:55:36] <%Heart0fInk> Whaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaat? Paige not reliable? Noooooooooooooo
[0:55:40] <cartakus> Really small frame
[0:55:47] <%Spadoinkle> When did you last play it straight thru?
[0:55:48] <Coystick> She'll bang it out over the summer
[0:55:51] <SirSaki> Can't go wrong with a classic Zelda
[0:55:53] <el_flako_killer> Something story driven?
[0:55:58] <%Heart0fInk> Halo 2's music is so strange
[0:56:05] <+Axellogic> But she's been streaming so muc- *sees its been almost a month* yeah
[0:56:07] <dybia> As far as an LP I usually don't like watching solo LPs, but I've watched you play DS1 like 2 or 3 times, so you do something right.
[0:56:11] <cartakus> It's jesus music
[0:56:14] <%JamesCorck> The inverted one looks better, imo.
[0:56:18] <%KellBeII> goodness, what about majoras mask?
[0:56:21] <%daveronald> have you played any of the half life games? cant remember if you mentioned them before
[0:56:31] <KakePews> I want more of that serie
[0:56:34] <+PleasantLee> someone close that public toilet door
[0:56:37] <%Spadoinkle> Hey, long enough to get fresh hands playing it again.
[0:56:57] <%Engwithan_Elder_God> Engwithan_Elder_God subscribed with Prime. They've subscribed for 3 months, currently on a 1 month streak! Keep on keeping on.

[0:57:12] <cartakus> oh god
[0:57:16] <%lifeofnotorious> Have you played FF13? I couldn't finish it.
[0:57:21] <Graahdicus> YIIK makes me sick
[0:57:55] <Coystick> Wodicans go hoooome
[0:57:58] <%Heart0fInk> @Graahdicus as it should
[0:58:04] <%KellBeII> they may have changed thier name
[0:58:05] <%Engwithan_Elder_God> Been away for awhile.

[0:58:13] <SWindleFeD> Merry late xmas random nerd
[0:58:20] <dybia> How do you feel about CRPGs? Pathfinder Wrath of the Righteous has a few characters you might like.
[0:58:28] <CaerwynMontale> That was Costa Del Sol music wasn't it
[0:58:29] <Graahdicus> ah Costa de Sol
[0:58:30] <Kyosan90> plagueNYA
[0:58:42] <Graahdicus> @CaerwynMontale yes it was
[0:58:46] <%Zebroneath> @SWindleFeD Thank you!
[0:58:52] <+PleasantLee> FE is iron
[0:58:55] <ffkjoao> yup
[0:58:56] <%JoshManVGH> It is
[0:58:57] <%Dorkfang> fe stands for ferum, its iron
[0:58:59] <SirSaki> Ay some NieR Automata
[0:59:03] <Maids4lyfe> it is
[0:59:04] <+Traximus_V> this song still makes me sad
[0:59:06] <KakePews> I can confirm it lies about, the viewer numbers.
[0:59:17] <+PleasantLee> big smart
[0:59:27] <+PleasantLee> bigger smart if you know why its FE and not I
[0:59:55] <%JoshManVGH> AU is gold, for "Ay, You! Come help me move this gold!"
[1:00:21] <Daxalog> That's depressing?
[1:00:35] <Maids4lyfe> yes
[1:00:41] <KakePews> I was counting a streamer's numbers that had apperently 6 wievers and i got up to about 27 like...uuuh...what?
[1:00:41] <warandpens> Nier's universe was allergic to human beings lol. Everything showed up to kill them
[1:00:50] <+Emptycup_fps> what do you use to draw on?
[1:00:57] <SirSaki> NieR's world is less advanced and more just continuing a cycle of faux humanity
[1:01:07] <+PleasantLee> thats what the last endings are for though
[1:01:11] <+Traximus_V> reminds me of soma
[1:01:12] <Maids4lyfe> ironically it was Adam who still had the drive for discovery and it lead to his death
[1:01:14] <%JoshManVGH> Then you have the two twins who remember when humans where a thing and know the whole of human and android history.
[1:01:29] <+PleasantLee> XP-Pen?
[1:01:35] <%JoshManVGH> And how much it sucks and they just have to live with that knowledge forever
[1:01:38] <Graahdicus> Bamboo?
[1:01:38] <%Spadoinkle> Huion?
[1:01:39] <SWindleFeD> Makes sense though, I imagine after no one doing maintenance that both software and hardware would degrade
[1:01:48] <%Heart0fInk> A penis pump?
[1:01:51] <%Heart0fInk> Oh
[1:02:24] <+PleasantLee> I'm using my Artist XP-Pen 22e pro right now
[1:02:32] <%JoshManVGH> Man that would be the dream
[1:02:33] <+PleasantLee> the screen colour is NOT accurate at all
[1:02:40] <%Spadoinkle> One of dem der doublewides.
[1:02:44] <SirSaki> Like one grade above a shack
[1:02:44] <%KellBeII> as long as its private and has good internet
[1:02:49] <ffkjoao> You may require very little, but deserve the best, you beautiful bastard <3
[1:02:51] <SWindleFeD> Hand up if you can afford a house, oh none of us can.....alright
[1:02:57] <CaerwynMontale> You can buy tough sheds for 18k that you can make into decent homes.
[1:03:12] <%lifeofnotorious> I think nier is just an excuse to show off 2B's robotic backside
[1:03:18] <zolanius01> Ahoy plague!
[1:03:51] <CaerwynMontale> oathThink
[1:04:06] <%KellBeII> morons in other words
[1:04:11] <SirSaki> "I just wanna build a damn shed to live in." "No, laws and red tape though."
[1:04:13] <+PleasantLee> sovereign citizens?
[1:04:13] <OzzySnek> Lot of people playing Earthcraft Survival Hardcore
[1:04:17] <KakePews> How is your well btw?
[1:04:50] <+Axellogic> Did you know that leaves come from plants?

[1:05:32] <%vanyaz94> vanyaz94 gifted a Tier 1 sub to Screamlord_Bonerhitler! 
[1:05:33] <+Axellogic> Crazy I know
[1:05:52] <Dunmarkh> Doing well hopefully?
[1:06:01] <%Heart0fInk> Was it taken by the tornado?
[1:06:31] <%Spadoinkle> Metal taste.
[1:06:37] <Dunmarkh> My local tap water isn't vegan lmao
[1:06:43] <Maids4lyfe> I love my tap water
[1:06:44] <%Heart0fInk> Tap water is fuckin awful!
[1:06:44] <SirSaki> Its disgusting but its the last digit option. That's why you gotta buy a filter if you can\
[1:06:47] <%cosmicleviathan18> I love tap water  ryboogFace
[1:06:51] <alextrebeken> you put in the fridge so the cold overs the flavor
[1:06:51] <+Axellogic> Its also why water filters are so lucrative
[1:06:53] <Maids4lyfe> @Dunmarkh that's concerning
[1:07:03] <%KellBeII> weirdly enough, ive never had an issue with tap water except in florida.  for some reason it just tasted vile
[1:07:06] <+PleasantLee> and even if you get a filtered water fountain you miss out on those important minerals
[1:07:18] <+PleasantLee> like the floride mind control substance
[1:07:20] <SirSaki> Also putting lime and or lemon juice to make it palitable
[1:07:22] <KakePews> I remember you were fond of your well and I wanted to try it, it depends were you are on the planet ofcourse.
[1:07:25] <Asubatsu> Tap water can be pretty bad depending on the place. I've always had it though. So I suppose my reaction to well water is the same as yours to tap.
[1:07:26] <%Heart0fInk> You well was riding dirty?
[1:07:27] <@Nightbot> Plague is a youtube animator and also streams at https://picarto.tv/Plague . Also: t-shirts! http://goo.gl/lze8QO
[1:07:27] <Maids4lyfe> but I love florida tap water D:
[1:07:35] <%JoshManVGH> Guess it depends on the location. Tap water in my town was pretty great.
[1:07:43] <%KellBeII> eyy goal reached
[1:07:48] <%Heart0fInk> @Maids4lyfe you like the brain eating ameba's huh?
[1:07:49] <Maids4lyfe> nice
[1:07:50] <%JoshManVGH> Until they needed to replace the Ozone filter unit...
[1:07:54] <Dunmarkh> @Dunmarkh It's because of them using clams or something to detect if the water is polluted
[1:08:15] <Maids4lyfe> @Maids4lyfe taste good don't think hard
[1:08:23] <%cosmicleviathan18> WHOOOO WE DID IT
[1:08:27] <%KellBeII> everyone was saving their subs for when you got back
[1:08:32] <+vsrach> good to see you back plague!
[1:08:36] <+Axellogic> Hey I dont have a life, and im off work so you get my eyes
[1:08:55] <SWindleFeD> And now a goal for a sub that'll call you daddy
[1:09:18] <Puhff> Look chat, look with your special eyes!
[1:09:47] <%Spadoinkle> Well, let's just mess it up more.
[1:10:07] <SWindleFeD> "I mean I 'm not dead yet"
[1:10:34] <Graahdicus> im half tempted to start a firew
[1:10:38] <Graahdicus> fire*
[1:10:43] <+Traximus_V> neir
[1:10:44] <+SoejimaMX> nier
[1:10:45] <+vsrach> I enjoy the proportions
[1:10:56] <BedSoap> What we drawing today?
[1:10:58] <+PleasantLee> I was thinking violet evergarden for a moment
[1:11:54] <Mrhuggles> It''s called Snip?  That will be useful.
[1:12:30] <%cosmicleviathan18> this song messes with my head with how much it skips about
[1:12:44] <SWindleFeD> This song made it sound like the stream was skipping
[1:13:00] <%Heart0fInk> Sadly thats true
[1:13:05] <SWindleFeD> The other one, not the Bloodborne one
[1:13:23] <SirSaki> Bloodborne's music always dances between really dramatic and really sareen
[1:13:38] <+SoejimaMX> stringy and drumzy
[1:13:40] <%KellBeII> theres a few standouts but yeah a lot of the music suffers from "post O and S direction"
[1:13:45] <+PleasantLee> spotify?
[1:14:03] <%Heart0fInk> wow that sounds dickish
[1:14:16] <SirSaki> Jeez, what a jackass. Sounds like he was spiteful
[1:15:05] <Asubatsu> Is that some Gargoyles? roflgatorKyute
[1:15:06] <+Axellogic> Hey man why worry about us,
[1:15:19] <SirSaki> Its all a-okay
[1:15:24] <SWindleFeD> I understand not bothering to put more work into supporting your software/extension functioning with external software, but to remove that support outright?
[1:15:31] <+CisealNine> You've been dealing with some shit. So it's more than understandable.
[1:15:31] <+Axellogic> I tried to use spotify once
[1:15:33] <KakePews> The C-virus xpkMonkaPEP
[1:15:35] <+Axellogic> then lost interest
[1:15:41] <Sunstalker> Paige and her cursed twitter post is relevant huh
[1:15:51] <+vsrach> plague you are moses striking water from the rock... we're just lucky to be here
[1:16:16] <Mrhuggles> I just buy cd's and play them from a media player.
[1:16:25] <%cosmicleviathan18> the good old days of Limewire
[1:16:30] <cartakus> Pascal village?
[1:16:41] <SirSaki> Yup yup
[1:16:52] <+Axellogic> I still remember how apple downloadable movies could only be downloaded once and if you lost the file it you money is just gone
[1:17:05] <Asubatsu> Like a misheard lyrics kind of thing?
[1:17:10] <%octotasty> nonsense is the universal language
[1:17:11] <%cosmicleviathan18> oh the the robot children are singing
[1:17:19] <+Cook_4_Souls> Hello everyone
[1:17:40] <TheresAGoff> "Prisencolinensinainciusol"
[1:18:05] <TheresAGoff> The song by an italian singer they made to prove that it will make it big if it sounds english
[1:18:07] <+PleasantLee> this songs title seems to translate to "Pascal" so maybe its a song about her
[1:18:11] <Mrhuggles> Not to mention how some people find accents sexy.  Like, speaking English poorly.
[1:18:14] <mountain_megatherium> @octotasty Word!
[1:18:21] <SirSaki> I found the lyrics and its just cute sounding nonsense. Here's a bit of it: Dotshlai dotshmi aishklai fan  Don is blandis Botshil botsta dushin eit Andis klandis  Shoi a eskal bihin daka  Bondis alshdis Denshu pakris nal a bil ismal "
[1:18:56] <dumdumdeeditty> yeehaw (in sexy way)
[1:19:04] <%Heart0fInk> Yeah Pat..
[1:19:05] <+MisterMcMuttonChops> which American accent?
[1:19:07] <Maids4lyfe> lol
[1:19:10] <%KellBeII> too much phlem
[1:19:14] <dumdumdeeditty> hon hon
[1:19:17] <%cosmicleviathan18> Sensual "Howdy"
[1:19:20] <+Axellogic> French always sounds like they're gonna spit on me
[1:19:27] <Maids4lyfe> seductive y'all

[1:21:34] <+MisterMcMuttonChops> to be fair most movie actors aim for the mid western accent since it is the most normal/ middle of the road.

[1:24:28] <Asubatsu> Oh, yeah, and you just go berserk on the boss.
[1:24:41] <Maids4lyfe> lmao
[1:24:42] <SirSaki> Man, I'm still mad Twitch stopped doing the bits for watching ads by choice.
[1:24:44] <%cosmicleviathan18> How many squats can you do in a minute?
[1:24:58] <Asubatsu> "Hey, those aren't cheap, y'know!"
[1:25:06] <Maids4lyfe> @SirSaki didn't make sense to stop that, it got us to actually watch ads
[1:25:12] <%KellBeII> ahh, firelink
[1:25:40] <SWindleFeD> @SirSaki @Maids4lyfe still a money sink for them either way is why
[1:25:48] <Maids4lyfe> ah
[1:25:58] <+polypolipauli> Hooray it's Plague! ...And he's drawing Counselor Troi!
[1:26:33] <Asubatsu> @SirSaki I only did it once, didn't know they stopped though. My guess was automated bots or something.
[1:26:34] <+polypolipauli> Gargoyles is my favorite Star Trek spin-off
[1:26:36] <%JamesCorck> I thought this was Matriarch Benezia. lol
[1:26:54] <%octotasty> It's like RE Save Room music
[1:26:56] <Puhff> Fun Fact: Gene Roddenberry wanted Councilor Troi to be a three-breasted hermaphrodite
[1:26:57] <%KellBeII> theres something vaguely nostalgic about the firelink theme
[1:27:03] <%octotasty> which is fitting for Firelink Shrine
[1:27:05] <SirSaki> True but man. Still a bummer. It was a nice way to help out even if you didn't have money
[1:27:07] <%Heart0fInk> 2 and 3's hub musics just feel 'overworked' if you know what i mean.
[1:27:19] <%Heart0fInk> like they're trying too hard

[1:28:43] <mountain_megatherium> plagueHeadpat
[1:29:18] <Coystick> I'd watch a Vagrant Story LP tbh
[1:29:51] <%Heart0fInk> I've never even seen Vagrant story
[1:29:55] <%apatheticVigilante> always wanted to at vagrant story, never got around to it
[1:30:08] <Asubatsu> I tried several times to play through Vagrant Story. Dunno if I was just young and bad, or if it was actually that difficult.
[1:30:24] <%Heart0fInk> wear slippers

[1:31:18] <SirSaki> Everytime I hear this particular track I can only think of Khonjin House lol
[1:31:40] <Asubatsu> Tactics?
[1:31:43] <LordRevon> christmas stockings
[1:31:46] <%Heart0fInk> I like the sounds of them smacking a trash can lid in this song LUL

[1:32:14] <+DatFooGamma> Your soundtrack is pretty slick Plague
[1:32:17] <theloganbrand> Fran good.
[1:32:22] <%MightyDuckShoes> I hate that I really loved the "War of the Lions" setting and it just constantly got muddled.
[1:32:28] <+Axellogic> This song always made me feel like I was in FF8 suddenly
[1:32:39] <%MightyDuckShoes> And I'll never see a sequel...
[1:32:39] <%octotasty> The historian/narrator for FFT is name dropped in Vagrant Story, IIRC
[1:32:45] <+DatFooGamma> @Axellogic I know this song well and actually thought that myself
[1:32:52] <Asubatsu> It's Seymour's theme from 10
[1:33:03] <Coystick> The skin creases where the thigh meat meets the pelvis meat are like, honourable panties.
[1:33:12] <%apatheticVigilante> man with the machine gun absolutely a

[1:33:18] <%apatheticVigilante> slaps*
[1:33:18] <+TheGenieA1> the settings for ff12 and vagrant story are pretty similar thematically except vagrant story is on the ground
[1:33:19] <%MightyDuckShoes> @octotasty. Are they? I only know there's mention of King Delita
[1:33:22] <%boatzndhoez> boatzndhoez subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 4 months! holy heck plague welcome back, are things a bit better now? plaguePog
[1:33:43] <+Axellogic> I think its  mainly the instruments

[1:34:42] <Mathochism> At least his final theme is great.
[1:34:49] <+DatFooGamma> They make a little cape
[1:34:53] <theloganbrand> I'm glad you can get back to work, even if work is a different set of stressors.
[1:34:53] <+Axellogic> I'm just glad you're well enough to do things
[1:34:54] <dybia> Its a nice visual either way
[1:35:13] <%MightyDuckShoes> Creative license. Don't all the gargoyles turn their wings into capes?
[1:35:32] <%Heart0fInk> WOAH! Language Plague!
[1:35:36] <SirSaki> The way her wings are positioned are giving me some Slan Berserk vibes. All she's missing now is a corset
[1:35:48] <+PleasantLee> I'm having a mild crack at digital painting now. having fun, and I dont hate how it looks
[1:36:05] <Coystick> Magic Missile?

[1:37:18] <Coystick> Eyes on Me makes Laguna's story the best
[1:37:21] <+PleasantLee> love this song
[1:37:21] <%TheresAGoff> Also, Laguna has a personality
[1:37:21] <Mathochism> I think that's the general consensus for VIII.
[1:37:24] <CaerwynMontale> Ward?
[1:37:28] <+Axellogic> God that orphange ruined that entire game
[1:37:29] <%KellBeII> im a sleepy lad, gonna go to bed.  good to see you streaming again eli

[1:38:19] <CaerwynMontale> I'm literally replaying FF8 over the holiday break.
[1:38:19] <Mathochism> Gilgamesh theme.
[1:38:23] <%boatzndhoez> FF8 is deff up there
[1:38:28] <+Axellogic> But then Id have to rememebr them all
[1:38:29] <%TheresAGoff> Endwalker Battle Theme
[1:38:29] <%DescendantDroog> are we including FFXIV?
[1:38:30] <%CourtOfFamine> “Most boring motherfucker on the planet” WAY more interesting than squall. Lmao
[1:38:32] <%MightyDuckShoes> Blood for Baal!
[1:38:34] <SirSaki> Mmmmmhh... FF12 has a pretty solid one
[1:38:36] <+PleasantLee> something from XIII obvi
[1:38:36] <+DatFooGamma> Uhh...FFIV's is pretty nice
[1:38:37] <%Samk235> I like ff4's quite a bit
[1:38:39] <%TheresAGoff> Shadowbringer*
[1:38:41] <General_Terro> gilgamesh
[1:38:46] <%Heart0fInk> Well. i never played a final fantasy game in my life soooo...
[1:38:48] <+TheGenieA1> battle scene ff1
[1:38:49] <+Axellogic> Help there is a voidling meowing in my ear
[1:38:49] <Savage_Impulse> Square up everyone in chat
[1:38:52] <Savage_Impulse> Right now
[1:38:57] <%apatheticVigilante> battle at the big bridge
[1:38:57] <%lifeofnotorious> FFXIV OST - Omega-M/F Theme
[1:38:59] <Zero_gs> pretty much all the final songs for all the final boss in FF14
[1:39:00] <+Selmassian> Ff7 boss theme is great
[1:39:10] <Mathochism> The actual answer is the Endwalker final boss theme. :)
[1:39:12] <alextrebeken> the sad one
[1:39:21] <%cosmicleviathan18> final fantasy 15 bo8Bsmug
[1:39:28] <+CisealNine> I quite enjoy FFIV's. If it were not limited to battle music, I would say something from FFII.
[1:39:29] <%DescendantDroog> ff9
[1:39:36] <+GaspidarIII> looks great as is
[1:39:40] <%apatheticVigilante> I like ff9's
[1:39:44] <%TheresAGoff> Yeah its the Shadowbringer Battle theme, its clean AF
[1:39:49] <%JamesCorck> just from Final Fantasy? Man...
[1:39:50] <Mathochism> Oh. Uh, not FFX, that's for sure.
[1:39:51] <SirSaki> In that case FF6 is the top one. It becomes just good background fight music
[1:39:55] <Zero_gs> oh, then i dont remember as i have only ever been able to get into FF14 sadly
[1:40:05] <%Heart0fInk> Chrono Cross battle music. :)
[1:40:15] <%apatheticVigilante> hell yeah Chrono cross
[1:40:17] <Savage_Impulse> It has to be ff music?
[1:40:17] <CaerwynMontale> Yeah FF6's battle music doesn't get old.
[1:40:25] <CaerwynMontale> Yeah, Chrono Cross as well.
[1:40:32] <%JamesCorck> If outside of FF, the battle theme from P5.
[1:40:33] <Savage_Impulse> It’s all trash Kappa
[1:40:33] <+Axellogic> I can talk about how Ive grown long since exhausted by Matoi Sakuraba's instruments he uses
[1:40:36] <%lifeofnotorious> That's a tough call, I've only really played FF12, 14 and 3. 14 has the most digestable generic battle music per expansion IMO.
[1:40:40] <%Heart0fInk> Go vore a sammich plague
[1:40:47] <+Corydonn> Tactics has some great random battle music. Is that a cheating answer?
[1:41:09] <%JovianGargoyle> What do we got? 5? 6 eggs? Those are rookie numbers. plagueBark
[1:42:17] <+PleasantLee> remember to tweet it to marina
[1:42:27] <Coystick> [SWEATS]
[1:42:43] <mountain_megatherium> Why did I imagine her mean rich anime girl
[1:42:46] <mountain_megatherium> laughing
[1:42:46] <dybia> You'd have disdain for everything if you were in Death Wish 3
[1:42:51] <unit2444> It is
[1:42:53] <%Heart0fInk> yes
[1:42:58] <%lifeofnotorious> love and hate are similar, so yes
[1:42:59] <%MightyDuckShoes> Don't like space choirs and drums?
[1:43:00] <Mathochism> Just have her vore Goliath. Peach is into that.
[1:43:05] <SirSaki> Halo is VERY hit or miss
[1:43:25] <%Heart0fInk> I like Halo 1's music.
[1:43:44] <%Heart0fInk> halo everything else is... uhhhhh....
[1:43:55] <%Heart0fInk> not great
[1:44:25] <Asubatsu> Halo 2 and ODST had pretty stellar sound tracks.
[1:44:35] <%MightyDuckShoes> There is a disconcerting interest out there in sangheili women. plagueHarkness
[1:45:02] <%Heart0fInk> I hate Halo 2's music the most LUL
[1:45:14] <%MightyDuckShoes> The music, I dont think about it much until I suddenly find myself humming to it
[1:45:19] <%cosmicleviathan18> eggs anyone? plagueEggs plagueHarkness
[1:45:20] <SirSaki> @MightyDuckShoes What, you don't want a bigger more powerful alien woman to crush you metaphorically and possibly literally?
[1:46:08] <%Heart0fInk> You should. it's the correct choice.
[1:46:19] <theloganbrand> Time for fortnite next.
[1:46:37] <%Heart0fInk> The story of thinly vailed "Give us your money"
[1:46:50] <%MightyDuckShoes> @SirSaki I just feel like I will likely be disappointed when and if they ever do make an official appearance. They wont be to the rabid fanbases's expectations. LIke those toothpick saiyan girls.
[1:47:21] <MattRX> Demona looks great so far
[1:47:36] <mountain_megatherium> Ah LSL

[1:50:43] <%TheresAGoff> I remember Advent Children turning it into a western cowboy theme though plagueFace
[1:51:08] <%Heart0fInk> Whatever fuckin song plays in the robo hand segment in remake makes me want to fuckin puke. i hate remake's version of that song.
[1:51:55] <%JovianGargoyle> Why is gargoyle milk so popular?
[1:52:07] <%JovianGargoyle> Because it’s high in minerals.
[1:52:21] <%apatheticVigilante> plagueFace
[1:52:27] <cartakus> Ugh

[1:53:34] <Julkson> @JovianGargoyle That sounds like it could crystallize and cause breast stones
[1:53:55] <+legioned247> how are you doing today eli
[1:54:06] <%cosmicleviathan18> what do we need?
[1:54:33] <%TheresAGoff> I can appreciate that there are strings in the background to layer the song more
[1:55:10] <%Heart0fInk> probably didn't care about the song or something stupid
[1:55:44] <Travis_Biscuit> Never understood why it was so hard to just orchestrate the original tracks. To each their own I guess.
[1:55:48] <morcego_cinzento_arts> good afternoon, finally made it home to watch the stream
[1:55:52] <+legioned247> Eli thank you for explaining dark souls 1 with everything that happened in dark souls 3 I was so confused

[1:59:31] <+legioned247> gargoyle was so cool I still remember the episodes where they where traveling the world and introduced me to so many different myths from all over the world

[2:01:54] <%TheresAGoff> @JamesCorck Im not thinking of the Vipers...
[2:02:01] <+legioned247> puck was an asshole
[2:02:49] <%JovianGargoyle> Aren’t all fae?
[2:02:58] <Mathochism> puck was also voiced by Brent Spiner a.k.a. Data.

[2:03:48] <+legioned247> it was this evil ai that too over everything
[2:04:01] <%apatheticVigilante> I was always a fan of the zeal themes, even though they were kinda simple
[2:04:09] <+roderick_legend> Yo plague good morning, doing the good stuff I see

[2:04:37] <morcego_cinzento_arts> Owen the most beloved and corageous assistent ever. Xhanatos did not deserve him
[2:04:53] <%Bigchill___> plagueNYA
[2:04:57] <+legioned247> Owen was puck
[2:06:09] <morcego_cinzento_arts> there was a episode where Elisa turned into a Gargoyle. she became even hotter
[2:06:18] <+legioned247> I never forget that episode because it was less of a dream and more of a what if future premonition
[2:06:24] <kingofnymphs> lol
[2:06:33] <kingofnymphs> why does the robot kick their ass?
[2:06:38] <+legioned247> ass kicking robot
[2:06:43] <+PleasantLee> can the robot be really hot and have huge thighs
[2:06:58] <%daveronald> ass kicking clout
[2:07:06] <%JovianGargoyle> I just realized Fox’s mother was Captain Janeway. That Star Trek rabbit hole was deep.
[2:07:15] <kingofnymphs> The robot should have kissed and hugged them
[2:07:17] <%apatheticVigilante> plagueTaps plagueCool
[2:07:19] <chidory000> that was in nier automata i think
[2:07:22] <+legioned247> let's travel to ass kicking robot woods
[2:07:27] <@Nightbot> Plague is a youtube animator and also streams at https://picarto.tv/Plague . Also: t-shirts! http://goo.gl/lze8QO

[2:07:46] <%daveronald> you would also gets the sex creeps who are into it
[2:08:14] <%Heart0fInk> So is the robot beating me up or is it a leg robot that actually kicks asses?
[2:08:31] <+Axellogic> Will it speak french?
[2:08:35] <+legioned247> let's get the legendary golden legging of the thick thighs ass kicking robot woods
[2:08:35] <%apatheticVigilante> where does the robot get spit?
[2:08:37] <%daveronald> ok so how hot is this robot?
[2:09:01] <%MightyDuckShoes> PROB-LO-MATIC

[2:09:08] <%KingKrampus> why would the robot have a job
[2:09:16] <%MightyDuckShoes> Toxic.exe
[2:09:27] <%MightyDuckShoes> oh that turned into a link?
[2:09:31] <morcego_cinzento_arts> you are supposed to inflict physical violence but not be verbally abusive
[2:09:40] <CyberDingus> PixelBob fembots pay him no attention, which makes him good at his job.
[2:09:41] <%CourtOfFamine> Life’s hard for a robot named ugg-0
[2:09:54] <%Heart0fInk> Ayyyyyyyyyyyyyyy! Shadow of the colossus!
[2:09:54] <+legioned247> this is escalating fast eli
[2:10:06] <%CourtOfFamine> In-Cell
[2:10:09] <+Traximus_V> we still talking about robots
[2:10:16] <General_Terro> incel bot? LUL
[2:10:21] <Mathochism> Banger alert. juicepBASS juicepBASS juicepBASS
[2:10:22] <silentshrug> also steam comes out of his ears when he's angry, thats an important part
[2:10:22] <Asubatsu> Speaking of robots
[2:10:28] <%Heart0fInk> Neckbeard bot
[2:10:30] <+legioned247> ass beating woods is where the cool kids go
[2:10:31] <Asubatsu> This is Nier
[2:10:33] <Mathochism> Automata, actually.
[2:10:49] <%vanyaz94> degraDance
[2:10:55] <Asubatsu> Ironically it's the robot fight
[2:10:57] <%Samk235> Fate of the Unknown in Nier Automata I think
[2:11:04] <+Dark_Chiefy> car factory robot with a shoe at the end.
[2:11:09] <Asubatsu> Wait, it's all robots nyannHmm
[2:11:09] <+Risingxiv> lol, I though he was joking LUL
[2:11:19] <+legioned247> Eli you where nier sighted
[2:11:31] <+Double_Tap_That> I like that tho
[2:11:35] <morcego_cinzento_arts> nier has more booty
[2:11:37] <Mathochism> This also sounds like it could have been ripped straight out of a Tekken game.
[2:11:48] <+legioned247> to say it was remake
[2:12:18] <Mathochism> Which isn't surprising since the Nier composer has done a bunch of Tekken music.
[2:12:41] <+legioned247> am I the only gargoyle fan boy who remembers the wild pack
[2:12:48] <+JariahSynn> nope
[2:12:52] <+JariahSynn> I remember
[2:12:59] <morcego_cinzento_arts> yeah i can hear it being MKish
[2:13:37] <%JovianGargoyle> I bought the comic about Dingo.
[2:13:42] <morcego_cinzento_arts> specially the wes anderson MK movie techno tracks
[2:13:48] <Asubatsu> Massive forehead?
[2:13:53] <kingofnymphs> Like her human form?
[2:13:54] <%MightyDuckShoes> Is it a void?
[2:13:55] <+legioned247> I still found it so weird when most of the wild pack turn themselves into cyborgs
[2:13:57] <Artista_AF> 5head?
[2:14:02] <+legioned247> yes I remember
[2:14:03] <+PleasantLee> like faye?
[2:14:07] <+legioned247> eli
[2:14:09] <Asubatsu> Oh, the opposite
[2:14:10] <%MightyDuckShoes> LUL
[2:14:16] <morcego_cinzento_arts> i don't  remember. i remember her in human form though
[2:14:19] <cartakus> Okay....
[2:14:19] <+Double_Tap_That> oh no
[2:14:22] <%Heart0fInk> O no..
[2:14:27] <Artista_AF> i hate it, yeah...
[2:14:27] <silentshrug> just did nothing with the hair
[2:14:28] <%JovianGargoyle> Burn it
[2:14:30] <Asubatsu> So her forehead has fur
[2:14:50] <+JariahSynn> I think it's about the same just different color
[2:14:50] <morcego_cinzento_arts> she has the fleshy crown from Elder Kain in Soul Reaver
[2:14:57] <Mathochism> And now for the best Nier track.
[2:15:03] <cartakus> What is that one? The dark nier?
[2:15:11] <Mathochism> Shadowlord.
[2:15:16] <kingofnymphs> Oh, I was confused, for some reason I remember her having horns
[2:15:18] <cartakus> Oh
[2:15:28] <%MightyDuckShoes> I'm just imagined a king taking off his crown to reveal he has a Bart Simpson skull
[2:15:44] <Maids4lyfe> lol
[2:16:01] <morcego_cinzento_arts> maybe make He face expressions more sharp? idunno if you mean that
[2:16:15] <+legioned247> I remember too much about gargoyle eli
[2:16:21] <+legioned247> thalog
[2:16:54] <%Heart0fInk> The castlevaina show rocks
[2:17:01] <nailyk_tv_> what is your logiciel of drawing ? pls
[2:17:05] <cartakus> I don't know how to feel about the last season
[2:17:22] <cartakus> I like death though
[2:17:32] <+legioned247> Eli are you fucking death
[2:17:37] <silentshrug> people who hated the library episode
[2:17:42] <+legioned247> lol
[2:17:55] <+Risingxiv> I think the Netflix series is good but I don't think its what comes to mind when I think of Castlevania
[2:17:55] <+legioned247> death was the best character
[2:17:56] <%Heart0fInk> Those people are still not as bad as Heman fans. those are THE MOST Toxic people ever.
[2:18:13] <+legioned247> he was cursing like salor
[2:18:14] <+PleasantLee> the one with the eyes
[2:18:15] <%Heart0fInk> I remember him saying humans are fucked up
[2:18:15] <%Bigchill___> Bug-Face is the strongest
[2:18:20] <cartakus> "lmao I am the greatest, eat shit belmont"
[2:18:41] <%Heart0fInk> I fucking loved Isaac
[2:18:42] <theloganbrand> War of 1999 would be nice, but Id like some more adaptation of real stuff. I like what they did so far though
[2:18:42] <Maids4lyfe> Varny the Vampire such a loser name
[2:18:52] <morcego_cinzento_arts> haven't seen the Castlevania show yet. never had any strong feelings about the games
[2:19:17] <%Heart0fInk> @Maids4lyfe It super is LUL
[2:19:17] <+legioned247> I mean he is fucking death
[2:19:52] <+legioned247> I saying it like that because that how he say it
[2:19:58] <Puhff> How did you feel about the animated Witcher movie thing ripping off the Castlevania series?
[2:20:03] <+legioned247> very funny
[2:20:07] <theloganbrand> The series fixed my main complaint pretty fast which was the first season didn't have the music, but then I feel like they blew using the music I like too early.
[2:20:11] <Puhff> Cuz i din't like it
[2:20:13] <Maids4lyfe> Malcom McDowel is expensive probably
[2:20:50] <%Heart0fInk> Thats the only "Don't worry about it" I'll accept.
[2:20:54] <cartakus> I liked the whole witchers need more job to do thing. But tge movie is meh
[2:21:05] <kingofnymphs> oooo
[2:21:06] <morcego_cinzento_arts> a death eater? get away from me with that harry potter crap
[2:21:07] <Puhff> yeah uh he's a spirit that feeds on death and choose to look like a skellyman for...reasons?
[2:21:07] <%Heart0fInk> because he's a weird nightmare monster. don't worry about it
[2:21:15] <BreakerDS> OOOO
[2:21:19] <Mathochism> spoder
[2:21:27] <Puhff> That fight was awesome though
[2:21:32] <Maids4lyfe> it was
[2:21:48] <CyberDingus> PixelBob The Duke had a fetish for the spider girls. As a simp for Rachnera I can relate.
[2:21:54] <+PleasantLee> seathe became a spider?
[2:21:59] <Puhff> huh?????
[2:21:59] <cartakus> Don't worry about it
[2:22:01] <%Heart0fInk> Was reincarnation a thing in DS2?
[2:22:07] <morcego_cinzento_arts> wait, Seathe reicarnated as a spider?
[2:22:15] <%TheresAGoff> should have just made it and called it "shadow souls" or something
[2:22:18] <Maids4lyfe> it was hamfisted in last minute @Heart0fInk
[2:22:20] <Puhff> yeah i missed that lore bit
[2:22:23] <Yrefe> I love playing DS2, but the story is so stupid, and everything looks just brown
[2:22:26] <cartakus> The lords of two were born with the souls of one yup
[2:22:29] <%TheresAGoff> Anthology that crap
[2:22:30] <CyberDingus> PixelBob No need to seek dragon scales if you are a two-headed spider.
[2:22:44] <+Axellogic> I played too many Tales of games and now hate Matoi Sakuraba's music as it hasnt changed at all in decades
[2:22:56] <cartakus> Gwin is old iron king...for some reason
[2:22:57] <%octotasty> I always assumed it was a sort of pet that got too big by eating magic crystal goo
[2:23:01] <Maids4lyfe> explain how the old iron king was a lava monster and was actually Gwyn reincarnated
[2:23:01] <+PleasantLee> wow....using the same ideas for game content over and over again really worked out for them in the end. can just call it plot and lore
[2:23:09] <morcego_cinzento_arts> oh they all reicarnations, like literal ones? whaaaa
[2:23:19] <Puhff> i still dont remember this two headed spider LU:
[2:23:22] <Puhff> LUL
[2:23:30] <%Heart0fInk> Then you kill vendric like a god damn enraged ape.
[2:23:31] <%MightyDuckShoes> Couldn't they have just had Duke "be" Seeth or his progenitor in some way? And the spider ate him of some thing?
[2:23:59] <Artista_AF> yep, totally not the huge-ass dragon that's nested by the Spiders
[2:24:04] <%MightyDuckShoes> Nope nope nope. DS2 was my first souls and I burned out exactly because every thing was a call back to a game I didn't play.
[2:24:08] <%Heart0fInk> BTW Have you seen Primal? The show i mean.
[2:24:13] <Maids4lyfe> @morcego_cinzento_arts yeah iron king was Gwyn, spider was seathe, and the prisoner was witch of Izalith
[2:24:20] <%TheresAGoff> I love FFX and I dont know how much of it is nostalgia or if its because its the first one I finished
[2:24:26] <cartakus> If they just went with the kings story of fucking up everytime that would be fine
[2:24:38] <ZawaAmaz> the original story beats were cool though, like Velstadt and the Fume Knight, or Lucatiel and her brother
[2:24:41] <Tracazoid> "Let's make another Max Payne because his suffering over 1 and 2 weren't enough." Meanwhile there's people who want a 4.
[2:24:43] <Puhff> Ya think they just had Gwyndolin's corpse on display like a Confederacy statue and Aldritch was like "Imma eat dat"
[2:24:49] <Puhff> i do
[2:24:49] <Yrefe> remember when tarkus got turn into a scorpion man for some reason? or maybe he's not tarkus, who knows ResidentSleeper
[2:24:51] <+legioned247> Yes
[2:24:56] <morcego_cinzento_arts> The Dark Souls 3 had some dude really obcessed with becoming like seathe, a mutant. and having a invicible baby
[2:25:00] <Asubatsu> New? No, remake, rehash, use the defib on x series.
[2:25:07] <+PleasantLee> meaningful endings? sounds gay
[2:25:09] <tubit> coming out of lurking to say i absolutely agree
[2:25:21] <Puhff> Oceiros was actually cool imo
[2:25:33] <Maids4lyfe> the only good thing from 2 was Jester Thomas and by good I mean terrifying.
[2:25:34] <unit2444> Oh no...
[2:25:37] <+legioned247> I mean we do need to beat the dead horse 🐎 eli
[2:25:40] <cartakus> Oceiros aka baby stomper
[2:25:48] <CyberDingus> PixelBob I remember Yahtzee once said he'd out-law making sequels, to make sure the game dev TRULY try their best.
[2:26:04] <Maids4lyfe> Miyazaki hates babies
[2:26:15] <morcego_cinzento_arts> was He, though? Oceiros just seamed like "hey remember seathe?"
[2:26:16] <Maids4lyfe> hates them like a Jojo villain hates dogs
[2:26:45] <Puhff> I mean, I also like huge stories that can't be told in a single setting but yeah, everything also doesn't need to be franchised to death
[2:26:47] <Yrefe> you mean like araki hates dogs Kappa
[2:26:56] <Maids4lyfe> yes, lol
[2:27:02] <%lifeofnotorious> nier music makes me drowsy
[2:27:30] <+Axellogic> Remember when Halo had a definitive ending
[2:27:37] <cartakus> I'd rather kill the cute dog than see cowboy man die
[2:27:43] <@Nightbot> Plague is a youtube animator and also streams at https://picarto.tv/Plague . Also: t-shirts! http://goo.gl/lze8QO
[2:27:47] <%lifeofnotorious> @Axellogic imagine halo letting chief retire lol
[2:27:58] <+legioned247> Eli are we ever going talk about how the end of chrono trigger your mom steps in a time portal chasing a cat and is just lost in time
[2:28:12] <Maids4lyfe> no
[2:28:13] <morcego_cinzento_arts> Man i am really stupified that spider boss is supposed to literally be Seathe reincarnated
[2:28:15] <kingofnymphs> idk man, halo is doing weird shit now
[2:28:15] <+Traximus_V> for like 5 years
[2:28:22] <Maids4lyfe> 5 years isn't the future
[2:28:25] <Yrefe> sure, why not? Anything to put him in a warzone
[2:28:44] <Maids4lyfe> you need a minimum of 10 before it's the future
[2:28:45] <Dunmarkh> you people say this like Florida will exist in 5 years
[2:28:46] <Asubatsu> I dunno, Halo ended for me at 3. Everything new might as well be a fan fiction.
[2:28:53] <Dunmarkh> the future is soon
[2:28:54] <morcego_cinzento_arts> Master Chief lost his hot virtual girlfriend, now all He has left is a bunch of nerds
[2:28:57] <%MightyDuckShoes> I played Infinite. Seemed pretty normal, all things considered
[2:28:59] <+legioned247> that the true ending or quiot un quiot true ending

[2:29:07] <%lifeofnotorious> I think chief's story should have ended with Halo 3. Halo 4... okay we NEED a sequel.. and Halo 5.. wow we're beating a dead horse here to say the least
[2:29:17] <Artista_AF> @morcego_cinzento_arts because it's not, the Spider doesn't even drop a Soul, you pick it from a Dragon corpse that's right fucking there
[2:29:40] <+legioned247> nyan

[2:31:13] <Asubatsu> Wait, so their models are hot AND they're hot IRL? or just the models?
[2:31:14] <dybia> I like the 14 streamer Haru, his answer was to make his Vtuber avatar the catgirl he plays in 14.
[2:31:15] <Maids4lyfe> Saitama is attractive by his winning personality
[2:31:20] <kingofnymphs> some guys just dont want to be anime boy
[2:31:23] <theloganbrand> I think there's one dude who has a like... hentai ugly bastard persona

[2:31:39] <cartakus> oh nooooo
[2:31:46] <$sleepy_coffee> we just need to do an 80s movie montage of Plague becoming a super hot anime cat man
[2:31:54] <Yrefe> that guy it's keeping it real

[2:32:09] <smoothwood07> what does it mean?

[2:33:51] <morcego_cinzento_arts> The return of Professor Harkness
[2:33:53] <Maids4lyfe> The Gascoigne at the bank was a girl @JovianGargoyle
[2:34:05] <%JamesCorck> What's your motivation with making a sequel to it?
[2:34:17] <CyberDingus> PixelBob They would. For money.
[2:34:18] <Coystick> You'd make a great Dungeon Master, not even fluffing your balls
[2:34:20] <LVL1_Scumbag> I hear the korean ones are cheap
[2:34:27] <+PleasantLee> time to win the lottery to get you that studio
[2:34:40] <%legioned247> thank to you eli everytime I get my blood taken at the doctor I play your video and I like what that smell
[2:34:42] <sleepy_coffee> ye
[2:34:47] <CyberDingus> PixelBob Love your animations Plague.
[2:34:53] <%Heart0fInk> Just buy a fully staffed animation studio with your hordes of YouTube bucks. Kappa
[2:34:59] <%legioned247> the blood
[2:35:03] <+Aleister_Grey> plagueNYA
[2:35:13] <Puhff> it's enough to make a man based
[2:35:15] <%legioned247> no eli thank you for stream
[2:35:39] <sleepy_coffee> i can finally use my work money for corrupting others while showing my undying admiration.
[2:35:41] <%MightyDuckShoes> Has someone made Dark Souls but it's Animal Farm/Island of Dr. Moreau yet?
[2:35:52] <%MightyDuckShoes> I feel this is an untapped market
[2:36:17] <Puhff> Oh fuck yeah, my Gamercube just arrived!
[2:36:49] <sleepy_coffee> I've seen some little crossovers of AC and Bloodborne
[2:37:02] <%Heart0fInk> When are you going to make a hot pokemon rom hack Plague?
[2:37:05] <%JamesCorck> Horniness moves the world.
[2:37:08] <cartakus> Pewd?
[2:37:09] <morcego_cinzento_arts> @mightyduckshoes Elden Ring comes pretty close with the dudes that craft limbs to them. closet to the vivesection angle in Moreau
[2:37:10] <Coystick> I'd replay gold or silver if all the chars were plague girls
[2:37:13] <kingofnymphs> That's a lot of effort, that's insane
[2:37:33] <%octotasty> Like that time Woolie made a joke about a robot dating sim called Mechromancer: a Transhumanist Dating Sim?
[2:37:34] <LVL1_Scumbag> There's been attempts, but the closest anyone's really come is moemon
[2:38:16] <%legioned247> i find eli video both very funny and questioning the Harkness test
[2:38:38] <%JamesCorck> If you had a team we'd have an animated series of Choose your Partner.
[2:38:56] <Puhff> @MightyDuckShoes You mean is there a Souls like with talking animals?
[2:38:58] <%MightyDuckShoes> How different could it be from what hentai folks do?
[2:39:00] <%Heart0fInk> don't worry plague. i have plenty of time to waste
[2:39:04] <%legioned247> Eli eat eggs 🥚
[2:39:18] <%lemoan> @lvl1_scumbag I'd play moemon but I don't like the generic anime girl/loli designs
[2:39:45] <%MightyDuckShoes> @Puhff Well plenty of talking animals in Souls games. I  just remember reading those books and seeing the connections with the themes of society collapsing and cannibalizing itself.
[2:39:55] <%legioned247> I think it looks great
[2:40:02] <Coystick> SPEED
[2:40:03] <kingofnymphs> There's a nice feeling in finishing something that fast though
[2:40:23] <%StridentSong> StridentSong subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 10 months! 
[2:41:00] <%lifeofnotorious> finally, wearing socks like a civilized human
[2:41:03] <%legioned247> your feet are going stupid lol
[2:41:25] <%legioned247> there never enough cake
[2:41:44] <%legioned247> those hips don't lie
[2:42:06] <kingofnymphs> vaguely
[2:42:07] <%legioned247> merry metal Christmas
[2:42:13] <+PleasantLee> ye
[2:42:14] <Puhff> no :)
[2:42:15] <%legioned247> I did it was fun
[2:42:17] <%Traximus_V> me neither
[2:42:19] <%octotasty> you didn't miss out on much
[2:42:23] <%octotasty> it was alright
[2:42:26] <+SleepDeprived42> If this is christmas music it's way more epic than any christmas I ever had
[2:42:27] <Mathochism> Nier is basically epic Christmas, yeah.
[2:42:28] <Coystick> FAT tail
[2:42:32] <%JovianGargoyle> It was weird
[2:42:32] <sleepy_coffee> the body will redirect blood flow essential areas, who needs blood in our feet when we our drawing a gargoyle with so much cake?
[2:42:39] <%Heart0fInk> I remember that Epic micky got blasted into hell by disney.
[2:42:51] <Coystick> It had great concept art
[2:42:55] <kingofnymphs> was there a sequel, or did I imagine that?
[2:42:55] <%apatheticVigilante> I gotta go, but I wanted to wish you all the best, Eli. I think your vids are the best on YouTube. I really love your insights into story/characters/plots/themes/etc. good shit. and your art is killer to boot. Take it easy dude. good luck with your family! plagueWave
[2:42:56] <+PleasantLee> they'd talk about that game like it was going to change the world of videogames
[2:43:04] <%Heart0fInk> @apatheticVigilante Later
[2:43:22] <Coystick> Hahahahaa
[2:43:25] <%legioned247> war Christmas music
[2:43:37] <tubit> pretty much LUL
[2:43:45] <Artista_AF> LUL not wrong
[2:44:08] <Coystick> I swear featly to Saint Nicol by the sword of the elven workshop
[2:44:10] <+SleepDeprived42> Fun fact, Micky Mania cause quite a stir in Ireland where micky is slang for vagina
[2:44:16] <theloganbrand> I watched Rise of the Guardians recently. Buff Santa with two swords was cool.
[2:44:34] <EddieDalmunda> The theme of getting hunted in the snow by Catholicism.
[2:44:41] <%legioned247> and so the war with kampus begins Santa elsewhere stand as the laste bastion of hope to keep the kampus elfs at bay
[2:45:13] <SivSarcast> The only carol I listen to is the Berserk AMV parody of "Christmas Time in Hell."
[2:45:21] <%TheresAGoff> Have you ever been asked to draw a tattoo for someone Plague?
[2:45:27] <SivSarcast> Also hey Plague how's it goin'
[2:45:46] <%legioned247> and so the war with kampus begins Santa elfs stand as the last bastion of hope to keep the kampus demons at bay
[2:46:04] <%legioned247> weapons ready
[2:46:08] <+SleepDeprived42> It's just DisneyLand Paris, but when it opened in the 90s it was EuroDisney
[2:46:10] <%Heart0fInk> Yeah it roughly translates to "Capitalist Nightmare Land"
[2:46:31] <%legioned247> that terrible
[2:46:51] <%legioned247> I bought it and that was a mistake
[2:46:54] <sleepy_coffee> oh neat, do you not earn cards or progression in single player?
[2:46:59] <Mathochism> And now for the best Automata song.
[2:47:49] <+Axellogic> I just dont get why B4B makes the specials all look exactly the same instead of distinct and easy to spot
[2:47:52] <AntlerNoodle> The grognards
[2:47:55] <vonmaultke> like Monster Hunter fans?
[2:47:57] <theloganbrand> Like how the DBD reddit is so Killer focused?
[2:48:00] <%Dakuu75> I honestly can't remember the last time I actually spent time in any online forum, probably not since high school
[2:48:00] <Coystick> God I love this track
[2:48:06] <Artista_AF> ah yes the "Sonic TRUE fans" who only played Sonic 2 back in '92
[2:48:08] <cartakus> Fighting game fans
[2:48:11] <%Heart0fInk> @vonmaultke More like COD fans
[2:48:37] <Coystick> You should win stuff by playing
[2:48:39] <%MightyDuckShoes> Maybe Pokemon should improve somewhat. (THE  MEEETTTAAAA!!)
[2:49:13] <+SleepDeprived42> @Artista_AF Does that make me a true Sanic fan? Better go swing my dick around in some Sonic forums then.
[2:49:36] <Artista_AF> @SleepDeprived42 you wouldn't be alone
[2:50:54] <+SleepDeprived42> @Artista_AF Oh well in that case I won't bother. Wouldn't want to entangle my internet dick with that of another "true" Sonic fan LUL
[2:51:26] <Artista_AF> it's like a Rat King of dicks LUL
[2:51:30] <+Windryu121> Tribes huh
[2:51:49] <cartakus> Cool
[2:51:58] <+Windryu121> I loved how they released all the games for free for awhile.
[2:52:57] <%Dakuu75> lol
[2:53:12] <+PleasantLee> by the time you see someone in that game its already too late to fight them
[2:53:14] <+Windryu121> Hi-Rez Studios
[2:53:44] <%TheresAGoff> Sounds like Titanfall 2
[2:53:57] <cartakus> The pkayers for realz
[2:54:27] <%Heart0fInk> Why can't we have slow moving games anymore? I fucking hate all theses GO FAST OR EAT ASS types of games
[2:54:32] <sleepy_coffee> "if we ain't going the fastest n shootiest then we ain't playing meta!"
[2:54:33] <%octotasty> That sounds extremely boring. You can't have a fast shooter with only hitscan weapons
[2:54:34] <theloganbrand> Gotta get a happy medium between that and the Japanese notion of 'NO change'
[2:54:43] <Presence_Eternal> In my opinion that was about 1/3 of what killed Asheron's Call. The big problem was simply that they abandoned it to work on AC2 though.
[2:54:50] <the_potential_hazard> aka overwatch
[2:55:09] <vonmaultke> stupid assholes that want to tailor the game to mechanics they have mastered the best so they can club a sever full of seals
[2:55:11] <Yrefe> "don't listen to those CASUALS, you need to think about the REAL GAMERS"
[2:55:12] <%legioned247> facts hazard facts
[2:55:14] <+Axellogic> Does this apply to the Dank Souls
[2:55:35] <%legioned247> even league of legends eli
[2:55:38] <Maids4lyfe> Blizzard happened to it
[2:55:40] <cartakus> Blizzard
[2:55:40] <+Axellogic> Blizzard happend
[2:55:41] <Mathochism> No real updates so no one plays it anymore.
[2:55:46] <%Traximus_V> balancing
[2:55:50] <%Heart0fInk> YUP
[2:55:51] <Mathochism> Also Blizzard.
[2:55:54] <Yrefe> yup
[2:55:56] <+PleasantLee> people stop playing it because blizzard are evil and also they started talking about OW2 that looked shit
[2:55:57] <%legioned247> overwatch got taken over by assholes eli
[2:56:01] <+Axellogic> The overbalanced Overwatch for esports and everyone stopped playing
[2:56:07] <Presence_Eternal> Easy to learn, hard to master is a great design philosophy. But don't forget the "easy to learn" part.
[2:56:09] <sleepy_coffee> Didn't blizzard just start combusting and flopped on the ground?
[2:56:17] <theloganbrand> They didn't make an official emote of Zarya busting a melon with her thighs. Doomed to fail really.
[2:56:40] <+Double_Tap_That> Appealing to the top-tier of players exclusively is pretty much a death sentence, but sometimes they do have valid feedback that that they can more accurately describe due to their inherent investment into the game.
[2:56:46] <Mathochism> OW will probably be a thing again when 2 drops, but who knows when that will actually happen and if Blizzard will be less shit by then.
[2:56:47] <%lifeofnotorious> Should games be designed to appeal to the largest audience? I'm thinking of Armored Core 5. The common player wasn't happy that you couldn't fly like superman anymore, left the game and the community died. They did not want to adapt to a slower more grounded style.
[2:57:01] <cartakus> The world is in dire need of a new ninja gaiden( also me, i am in dire need of new ninja gaiden)
[2:57:07] <%Traximus_V> I think the mercy rework was the start
[2:57:36] <sleepy_coffee> didn't DbD dip its toe into the nft bs?
[2:57:42] <%legioned247> Eli they ruined so many of the characters I use to play they destroyed shield classes the one class no one wants to play
[2:57:43] <+PleasantLee> I hear that to every killer player theres 4 survivor players
[2:58:01] <cartakus> ha ha ha
[2:58:08] <%legioned247> In overwatch
[2:58:23] <%Explodincatz> Explodincatz subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 5 months, currently on a 4 month streak! good to see you back, my cat passed away this Monday, take them to the vet asap if u see them unable to urinate
[2:58:27] <+Double_Tap_That> Also, I forgot who originally said it, but I subscribe to the belief that players are good at finding issues with a game but are terrible at providing good solutions for those issues.
[2:58:42] <Presence_Eternal> Is it seretonin or dopamine? I have no idea what is considered to be the skinner box hormone these days.
[2:58:45] <cartakus> I really don't know how the game got so big
[2:58:56] <Serbaayuu> @Double_Tap_That Most players can't accurately describe why they like games they like, even.
[2:59:08] <sleepy_coffee> oh geez, I'm sorry you went through that.
[2:59:22] <theloganbrand> Still no rewards for a stealth playstyle
[2:59:33] <%legioned247> I don't understand why nerf shields if all people want to play are asslt class why have a shields in over watch to begin with
[3:00:05] <%legioned247> yes
[3:00:18] <+PleasantLee> because they result in faster matches
[3:00:23] <%Explodincatz> like counter strike
[3:00:25] <%legioned247> fuck yes eli
[3:00:34] <%Heart0fInk> Riot shields and shotguns!
[3:01:03] <%legioned247> I played reinhardt take more then half his shield away
[3:01:15] <%legioned247> from nerf
[3:01:19] <cartakus> What?
[3:01:27] <%legioned247> yes
[3:01:35] <%Heart0fInk> LOL Just something. Something will cause you to explode
[3:01:40] <%legioned247> all shield got nerf
[3:01:57] <cartakus> Like swing a war hammer
[3:02:00] <%Explodincatz> no correlation fortunately
[3:02:29] <%legioned247> it so dumb eli
[3:02:38] <%Heart0fInk> What!? Aren't you guys excited for Overwatch 2!?
[3:02:42] <%Heart0fInk> guys.....?
[3:02:46] <%legioned247> no
[3:03:03] <sleepy_coffee> @Heart0fInk "yall got phones , Right??"
[3:03:09] <cartakus> I'm exited for sfm of overwatch 2
[3:03:10] <chris_matt_kong> sexually?
[3:03:29] <Maids4lyfe> makes sense
[3:03:34] <%lifeofnotorious> I can see why people would be upset about a dog passing. It's like happiness itself died. Unconditional love died.
[3:03:40] <%MightyDuckShoes> free veal
[3:03:48] <cartakus> Some great animations the comunity can make
[3:04:01] <theloganbrand> Buying extra chickens because you plan for a coyote eventually.
[3:04:14] <%Heart0fInk> I've had probably had over 100 pets die over the years i still get sad.
[3:04:15] <Maids4lyfe> I can't feel anything for people weirdly, but dogs? I'll cry for a dog
[3:04:33] <%Traximus_V> different environments
[3:04:37] <+SleepDeprived42> Yup. I saw a review of the new BAttlefront by a well known reviewer who was complaining about there only being 21 guns in the game and I thought "Only? How many guns do you need? How much granular difference is there between 21 guns?"
[3:04:59] <Maids4lyfe> lol
[3:05:18] <%lifeofnotorious> I have to go play tennis, have a good day everyone
[3:05:33] <Maids4lyfe> glory to your cat mittens!
[3:05:33] <cartakus> Cool I'm happy for you
[3:05:46] <sleepy_coffee> the animal went out in a blaze of glory.
[3:06:07] <+SleepDeprived42> All good dogs go to Sto Vo Kor
[3:06:14] <%legioned247> I understand what you mean I had a cat who was suffering and try to rush her to the vet and she passes on the way
[3:06:37] <stranger59> I value this farm wisdom (but I cry everytime a cat passes away)
[3:06:37] <%MightyDuckShoes> I mean. People usually have to put down animals because  they cant afford a simple  procedure. That's more  of the salt on the wound
[3:06:39] <kingofnymphs> I did, I just forgot
[3:06:40] <%Heart0fInk> @SleepDeprived42 didn't they say something to that effect in Star trek?
[3:06:42] <kookaburragangwar> Whats with the huge knockers then?
[3:06:45] <+PleasantLee> aww, I cant take a jello shot out of a garg anymore
[3:06:46] <cartakus> Wait...
[3:06:50] <%JamesCorck> I'm getting mesmerised by that raised leg, not gonna lie º3º
[3:07:03] <%Heart0fInk> LOL
[3:07:07] <cartakus> wtf lol
[3:07:11] <lewdnekojam> lol
[3:07:14] <%MightyDuckShoes> And that's how he lost an eye
[3:07:14] <+Double_Tap_That> That's amazing
[3:07:29] <cartakus> Are they space vikings?
[3:07:29] <sleepy_coffee> when them gargoyles turn to stone the stone is their excrement.

[3:07:36] <Prylegutt> every hole is a glory hole if you're klingon enough
[3:07:44] <stranger59> I gotta get all those Gargoyles toys coming out.
[3:07:48] <+SleepDeprived42> I like that mentality. Read a piece by a vet talking about how many animals go out in complete distress because their owners can't bear to be in the room with them when they go.
[3:07:48] <+tigerstyle96> Is Iowa a real state
[3:07:58] <+Axellogic> I like egg
[3:07:59] <cartakus> Make a omelete
[3:07:59] <%Heart0fInk> @tigerstyle96 no
[3:08:00] <%JamesCorck> Get some scrambled eggs.
[3:08:05] <MattRX> No
[3:08:08] <%legioned247> no
[3:08:08] <%Heart0fInk> I'd unsub...
[3:08:16] <kingofnymphs> eh, maybe. But I like watching cat Eli
[3:08:18] <darkdazzles> hot anime catboy

[3:08:45] <+tigerstyle96> You could be a hot anime MAN
[3:08:48] <+Double_Tap_That> Maybe if you were like a depressed-daddy type anime boy it would work, but I don't think so.
[3:08:51] <+Axellogic> Just take a hot anime body and superimpose your cat head on top

[3:21:10] <%Dakuu75> I remember the gargoyals show using a lot of sharp'n jagged facial features
