[0:03:32] <+Grim_McBonely> Hello all. Felt like a batch for not completing everything in DS3 so I got another copy.   kick some ass, Plague.
[0:03:35] <%theloganbrand> Kind of a Milf
[0:03:41] <NireFuster> did you already fight Artorias or is this your first run there?
[0:03:50] <+Grim_McBonely> autocorrect oroLUL
[0:03:53] <mellorolo> she so graceful about her misfortunes tho :v
[0:04:07] <+CHILIPUNK> Is that a talking Fungussssss? Kappa
[0:04:11] <%Foxfidget> I know saving the princess is the trope, but if Dusk is the princess, who is the king and/or queen?
[0:04:35] <mellorolo> voldemort had it
[0:04:44] <+KiwiRedgrave> jeremiah is the king @Foxfidget
[0:04:45] <%octotasty> I could very quickly go into blender and make her a dick
[0:04:50] <SuperJollyGreen> the fungus spores Kappa
[0:04:55] <cap_bon> Are you gonna be fighting DS1s precious little princess Artorius today
[0:05:02] <+CHILIPUNK> Why she no punch?
[0:05:30] <+CHILIPUNK> Removing their limbs makes them realize there is more to life than PUNCH.
[0:05:30] <%KellBeII> i could go for a goodie powder rn
[0:05:36] <%KellBeII> orange flavor pls
[0:05:39] <%octotasty> I guess From Soft just thought Mushroom People were neat
[0:05:43] <mellorolo> fungus are mainly hivemind so the "males" are probably females actually plague
[0:05:47] <mellorolo> *fungii
[0:06:40] <smagloooshy> manus' fart abyss
[0:07:04] <%octotasty> there's like a soul

[0:08:14] <ScreamLord> @PlagueOfGripes I'd sub to you but some spineless moron stole money from my card so until I get my new card and my money back it'll have too wait

[0:09:17] <kingdumpsterdracula> Evening everyone.
[0:09:53] <%Foxfidget> @ScreamLord That's Grant, Paladin Leeroy's weapon
[0:10:27] <Good_Snacks> Is this remaster?
[0:10:41] <crossolead> he
[0:10:43] <cinless> nah it's just a perspective trick, he's nowhere near you
[0:10:52] <%octotasty> you might as well get like a Lizardman Greatsword or something and use it with Weapon of Sunlight for Artorias
[0:10:59] <%KellBeII> you walked past it
[0:11:06] <cap_bon> bonk
[0:11:09] <@TheDropOutDragon> @cinless shut up
[0:11:09] <cinless> woolie loves it
[0:11:11] <@TheDropOutDragon> hello
[0:11:18] <cinless> hello dragon
[0:11:29] <@TheDropOutDragon> Hanging with some friends, surfing Twitch.
[0:11:32] <GarrisonPrime> dodWoke
[0:11:38] <kingdumpsterdracula> Funny Weapon go bonk is only funny for the first hour.
[0:11:52] <%octotasty> Dragons can't wear clothes. It's the law
[0:12:19] <cap_bon> Dragons just flying around with their junk flappin in the wind
[0:12:23] <cap_bon> Its the law after all
[0:12:51] <%Foxfidget> Dark Souls is very pro dragon butts, as lost Izalith can attest to
[0:12:53] <jetpack_rorschasch> We all get naked for these streams just for you Plauge. Kappa
[0:12:54] <+Grim_McBonely> Not to be taken for GRANTed
[0:13:06] <muxperience> thanks for the 4kings tank strat, it was very effective
[0:13:09] <Coystick> Royal woods, the Ultimate Zone in the Ultimate Video Game of All Time
[0:13:33] <@TheDropOutDragon> No point down?
[0:13:38] <@TheDropOutDragon> Game has changed.
[0:13:49] <cap_bon> literally no fun allowed
[0:13:49] <cinless> war has changed
[0:13:53] <%mellorolo> he was mad it wasn't feces :v
[0:14:18] <%octotasty> you should get the mod that makes Point Down parriable
[0:15:01] <@Nightbot> Plague is a youtube animator and also streams at https://picarto.tv/Plague . Also: t-shirts! http://goo.gl/lze8QO
[0:15:15] <%KellBeII> yeah theres lots of invaders who just invade because they got invaded once
[0:15:29] <cap_bon> "invasions are hard" Good. Stay in your own damn world.
[0:15:45] <@TheDropOutDragon> I haven't looked into much 'background' about Elden Ring. Just some footage, just things I'm looking for.
[0:15:54] <@TheDropOutDragon> It's nice to not care about 90% of the game.
[0:16:19] <kingdumpsterdracula> Thinking about having another drink before tonight ends. Blood Orange, Citrus, or Wild Berry?
[0:16:25] <cinless> at a certain point, the host dying is the reward
[0:16:43] <cap_bon> Also PvP gear and tactics differ ALOT from PvM
[0:16:49] <@TheDropOutDragon> You know what I'm looking for.
[0:16:58] <LunarRemix> It would be interesting if they could figure out a way to reward invaders for damage done or just time wasted around messing with the player
[0:16:59] <+Grim_McBonely> @kingdumpsterdracula Blood üçä
[0:17:26] <@TheDropOutDragon> Well, you do.
[0:17:28] <@TheDropOutDragon> And they do too.
[0:17:42] <@TheDropOutDragon> People who know who I am, they know.
[0:17:45] <%octotasty> they should just let you take control of an enemy as an invader, now that we know all enemies are set up as player characters
[0:17:46] <Andele1503> My logic for Elden ring is, its the 2nd souls game to have real poise, thats great
[0:17:47] <%bettysharkface> Afternoon
[0:17:50] <Coystick> I remember my PVE invasions a lot more than the PVP invasions, they're more fun when you utilize sneaky shit & the zone against the host
[0:18:39] <kingdumpsterdracula> Inspesting your weapon there?
[0:18:43] <cap_bon> Grant lookin kinda flaccid in the dlc area
[0:19:06] <LunarRemix> You know one thing that they should bring back from DS2? Armor scalling
[0:19:42] <Coystick> First build I made for Remaster was a lore-friendly Darkwraith with  an upgraded Dark Hand, working for the Fair Lady. completely none-meta build just after them humanities
[0:20:15] <cap_bon> Gotta finish DS1 so we can get back to the real content. Danganronpa 3
[0:20:29] <kingdumpsterdracula> Probably not...
[0:20:30] <otakon17> Pants!
[0:20:51] <@TheDropOutDragon> Captain Uggo flying away there.
[0:20:55] <otakon17> hi! bye!
[0:20:56] <%theloganbrand> Probably the last youtube play through, right?
[0:21:11] <cinless> don't be mean to the old man, dragon
[0:21:17] <otakon17> the delete yeet
[0:21:25] <+silvery_cricket> What ever happened to that huge Dark Souls mod that rewrote the game to being one guy's fanfiction
[0:21:27] <otakon17> Sekiro?
[0:21:49] <LunarRemix> You would not enjoy Sekiro
[0:21:51] <+silvery_cricket> The one where its like "Sin was Gwyn's wife"
[0:21:53] <otakon17> Dark Souls 3 loves to stunlock you
[0:21:54] <ducell998> Bloodborne next PogChamp
[0:21:57] <+durthknight> you could try Dwarf Fortress?
[0:22:07] <kingdumpsterdracula> Oh
[0:22:11] <+silvery_cricket> F
[0:22:11] <otakon17> the hell
[0:22:12] <cinless> a jump button is going to be nice
[0:22:22] <%KellBeII> you can map it to be that
[0:22:23] <@TheDropOutDragon> Happens.
[0:22:36] <otakon17> man a dedicated jump button <3
[0:22:42] <%KellBeII> you can change it in the remaster
[0:22:45] <+silvery_cricket> I wonder if there will be hidden walls in Elden Ring?
[0:22:54] <otakon17> I don't like having to hold triangle to two-hand
[0:22:56] <+silvery_cricket> Just running against every surface mashing X
[0:22:59] <+KiwiRedgrave> of course there will
[0:23:09] <@TheDropOutDragon> @PlagueOfGripes Out there suggestion. Feel free to solo but you wanna chill in discord for this? The -last- playthrough?
[0:23:33] <+silvery_cricket> I look forward to some random ass hidden wall that is in the side of a rock in some nothing field, that leads to the secret most important boss in the game.
[0:23:41] <@TheDropOutDragon> I don't care, just chilling is fun to me if you don't care.
[0:24:21] <Andele1503> Im still amazed that From Soft went out of their way to patch out DS1 files from DS3 instead of just turning it on so that players get to play by the same rules monsters do
[0:24:25] <%slix3431> Hey Plague do you lift bro?
[0:24:44] <%KellBeII> dropout isnt audible for the stream
[0:24:48] <%octotasty> if Dragon is there we don't hear him
[0:25:05] <%Foxfidget> Can hear him now
[0:25:07] <%octotasty> Hello Derg
[0:25:58] <kingdumpsterdracula> Thought it came out in 2018.
[0:26:12] <%theloganbrand> Running on farm time
[0:26:42] <%bettysharkface> Hey Plague would you ever play those Jack Box games?
[0:26:45] <+silvery_cricket> Final Fantasy is a 40 year old franchise
[0:26:57] <otakon17> Elden Ring <3
[0:27:11] <otakon17> yeah my brain is like 'it's still 3 months away, have fun"
[0:27:47] <+liquidzr0> Elden Ring Kreygasm
[0:27:48] <+silvery_cricket> What about Lies of P?
[0:27:54] <cinless> what's a ps5
[0:27:54] <+silvery_cricket> The first Blood like
[0:27:57] <otakon17> Sekiro will help you get used to jumping in a Souls game

[0:39:06] <LunarRemix> running around on DS3 PvP with a greatshield as a weapon was a fun time
[0:39:39] <+sasparillatango> I HATE pvp in souls games
[0:40:03] <cinless> fight clubs were a nice bit of community in a way
[0:40:11] <cinless> chilling and watching other people fight was a cool part of it
[0:40:15] <%bettysharkface> I don't mean offense when I say this, but I haven't heard you in a while now Dropout, not since RoninByDesign, and you sound relaxed
[0:40:26] <%billenjoi> plaguePog
[0:40:27] <Andele1503> Also known as the correct move, if you dont facefuck invaders they cheese gank

[0:45:50] <otakon17> Havel's gear is frankly some of the best gear in the game protection wise
[0:46:01] <%bettysharkface> If it helps, despite everything that's happened this year, I got out of retail and now I have a job helping disabled kids, I've also been sober for a bit over a year now, long enough that I lost count.
[0:46:33] <Call_for_Adventure> Stalker tip line I love that you don't even need to upgrade havel's fuckin shield
[0:46:34] <%bettysharkface> I feel like people don't tend to talk too much about their success and small victories as much as they should cause they don't wanna come across as like, smug
[0:46:37] <Call_for_Adventure> It just works
[0:46:38] <Profmcstevie> Gave me Gwyns soul, slapped my ass and called me betty. Kinda odd
[0:47:28] <Samex_Comex> plagueWave
[0:47:39] <cinless> i remember you could always tell when you got ganked by japanese players in the forest in dark 1 because they'd just instantly switch to the mimic head and not do any emotes
[0:48:20] <%ralphwiggum16> Goddamn it, it's always Kell!
[0:48:22] <cinless> well there is that

[0:51:18] <PonchoPronto> sick. I saw dragon's old ds2 heide tower pvp vids wayy back
[0:51:32] <%dzmi13> @TheDropOutDragon you need to start adding Nya when someone subs to you :)
[0:51:33] <five_foo> !uptime
[0:51:34] <@Nightbot> 51 minutes 43 seconds
[0:51:35] <jacksawjack> You need the light spell or the skull lantern for some secret walls.
[0:51:46] <%octotasty> The Pendant is the only important thing anyway
[0:52:16] <Call_for_Adventure> It's hard to beat the iron keep bridge
[0:52:27] <five_foo> Who is Eli talking to?
[0:53:19] <cinless> eli is talking to the dropout dragon, an old dark souls streamer
[0:54:00] <cinless> was that a stored roll?
[0:54:03] <%GarrisonPrime> dodCool
[0:54:14] <Call_for_Adventure> Yeah dark souls fucks with your inputs
[0:54:14] <%KellBeII> roll queuing is a thing in the remaster i think
[0:54:35] <cinless> sometimes a roll would get stored in another input
[0:54:39] <%KellBeII> if it waasnt buffered then it might be your pad
[0:54:44] <@Nightbot> Plague is a youtube animator and also streams at https://picarto.tv/Plague . Also: t-shirts! http://goo.gl/lze8QO
[0:54:45] <cinless> most memorably it'd end up in your block input
[0:55:20] <%QuasartheHero> oh hey dragon  dodCool dodCool
[0:55:41] <%QuasartheHero> wasn't expecting this with my work dinner
[0:55:45] <%QuasartheHero> dodWoke dodWoke
[0:56:35] <Call_for_Adventure> Nothing Personnel
[0:56:40] <LunarRemix> Don't you just love PvP
[0:56:48] <kingdumpsterdracula> I can not handle this game jank at times.
[0:56:52] <%octotasty> this is not exactly the best place to be human
[0:57:07] <%octotasty> since it's THE PvP hotspot
[0:57:26] <%KellBeII> yeah unfortunatly this is a hot spot and were meta level
[0:57:56] <%QuasartheHero> I hate invading in 3. 95% of my invasions were minimum 2 v 1
[0:58:05] <%QuasartheHero> and I hated the 4 v 1s
[0:58:52] <%QuasartheHero> one fucko always with the great bow to just blap me outa 1v1s
[0:59:10] <%QuasartheHero> plagueBark
[1:00:00] <%KellBeII> yeah its why i really do like the 3v1s in ds3.  when things are balanced between the invader and the host the invader still has the level and the host has nothing
[1:00:02] <%QuasartheHero> well here's hoping that elden ring will be better for all the  communities
[1:00:28] <Coystick> Tanking appears to be more of an option in Eddie Rang
[1:00:31] <Call_for_Adventure> Enden Ring should just give the invader a faster horse
[1:00:48] <%QuasartheHero> seems like shields are gonna be useful in ER
[1:01:30] <Call_for_Adventure> Ah, okay
[1:01:47] <%QuasartheHero> @call_for_adventure invaders get a marker on their Hud
[1:01:56] <%GarrisonPrime> bitterWave
[1:02:19] <PonchoPronto> be nice if they had at least one area you could have mounted fights in
[1:02:32] <%QuasartheHero> @garrisonprime plagueWave
[1:02:35] <cinless> given that there was a camouflaged npc, i can't imagine there won't be
[1:02:37] <%octotasty> I completely forgot Lloyd Talismans didnthat
[1:02:48] <Call_for_Adventure> I wouldn't bet against the dark souls team trotting out their old tricks
[1:03:16] <cinless> it's cool that they gave chester some unique moves
[1:03:16] <%octotasty> Jousting is fun
[1:03:22] <RickyRelucent> I was hoing for horse combat when invaded
[1:03:30] <RickyRelucent> hoping* sadge
[1:03:36] <%QuasartheHero> just use the BB method for hiding. and turn into a message
[1:04:09] <cinless> i hope there's a dragon covenant
[1:04:18] <cinless> just because i want to see another puff the magic dragon
[1:04:50] <RickyRelucent> ppl dislike ganks? its the best part LUL
[1:06:04] <cinless> i like how eli admits to having invaded like he's confessing that he's smoked weed
[1:06:18] <RickyRelucent> @cinless only if its not a mummified ram plagueNYA AAGH
[1:06:23] <sosuke5> It would probably solve a lot of issues if invaders could get some sort of benefit from invading even if they lose.
[1:06:26] <%QuasartheHero> oh dragon, you remember horse fuck valley from the ice dlc?
[1:06:42] <%QuasartheHero> I was that fucko sniping people off the bridge right before the boss

[1:07:52] <cinless> what did the ring of thorns even do?
[1:08:00] <RickyRelucent> reminds me of the invisible right and left hand rings from 2
[1:08:02] <%slix3431> He's dancing
[1:08:08] <RickyRelucent> the way you get it, i mean
[1:08:29] <+liquidzr0> ConcernDoge

[1:09:53] <cinless> the first time i saw that "first time chatting" message it was from a bot in someone else's chat, and i got to immediately ban them
[1:09:58] <Watumean> @plagueofgripes hey plague
[1:10:08] <cinless> it was a bad bot too, it greeted the streamer as "undefined"
[1:10:14] <Call_for_Adventure> I'm only here from your Conan movie commentary
[1:10:18] <CorrosiveFox> I mean your streams have been sporadic for years
[1:10:54] <%octotasty> lol
[1:11:20] <%xcompleasedad> Just animate 10,000 frames 4Head

[1:11:24] <+hagly> draw the frames drawman
[1:11:24] <%KellBeII> want me to crystal out?
[1:11:30] <%QuasartheHero> have you tried to do frame by frame again plague?

[1:12:08] <%QuasartheHero> oh my b
[1:12:42] <%QuasartheHero> last time I know you talked about was with smoge's addiction animations
[1:12:44] <cinless> tweening is when you use tweezers to move characters' arms and legs around and stuff for animations
[1:13:18] <LVL1_Scumbag> Animating seems like a nightmare
[1:14:41] <%FingaLights> not yet
[1:14:55] <+sasparillatango> is dark bead still the stupidly strong shotgun?
[1:14:58] <@Nightbot> Plague is a youtube animator and also streams at https://picarto.tv/Plague . Also: t-shirts! http://goo.gl/lze8QO
[1:15:11] <cinless> kitty cat solidarity

[1:15:37] <Samex_Comex> plagueNYA
[1:15:38] <%QuasartheHero> doesn't it have the most damage for any int based spell on the game?
[1:15:39] <+hagly> Gotta make those Ultra's fast when you flinch to the smallest dagger.
[1:15:40] <+TopTieramisu> kitty stink aura
[1:15:50] <%FingaLights> would be nice for Nito
[1:15:51] <cinless> alvina is fantastic
[1:16:05] <+Grim_McBonely> They may be fast but the Ultras are still obnoxiously slow for my personal playtstyle.
[1:16:09] <jetpack_rorschasch> Fart gas helps you fall, it's basic physics.
[1:16:13] <cinless> i love how she quietly goes "meow meow meow meow" in the background of her dialogue
[1:16:25] <+sasparillatango> not with summon?
[1:16:34] <CorrosiveFox> yea its because of the summon
[1:16:35] <+Grim_McBonely> Greatswords hit that sweet spot.
[1:17:06] <%QuasartheHero> ok, gotta get back to work. see you later plague, dragon
[1:17:10] <%KellBeII> want a straight sword?
[1:17:20] <+sasparillatango> what about giant dad?

[1:17:45] <CorrosiveFox> giant dad was a griefing build
[1:17:50] <+kingboro> you came to the wrong neighborhood muthafuka
[1:18:13] <%Solid_Stro> sabert14Box
[1:18:54] <cinless> black flame woo
[1:18:59] <+NmyLogan> plague is unabated by urban violence
[1:19:30] <%octotasty> I like the Man Serpent Greatsword in DS1
[1:19:48] <+kingboro> Now he is going to fill manus's man cavern with his estus flask
[1:20:06] <+sasparillatango> I think DS 2 was my favorite DS
[1:20:11] <%octotasty> oh wow Kell used a slab on that
[1:20:24] <cinless> yeah
[1:20:30] <cinless> yeah kell definitely used a slab on that
[1:20:39] <cinless> that friendly phantom sure is suspiciously wealthy
[1:21:08] <%bettysharkface> The way your character walked down that pillar was so fucking doofy, I love it
[1:21:20] <%gollygee> Some of the most fun I ever had in Dark Souls was doing PvP in Oolacile as Giantdad and I'm not afraid to admit it
[1:21:42] <%GarrisonPrime> He calls them brain kobolds
[1:21:45] <%bettysharkface> Brain worms, ocd
[1:21:47] <cinless> is it not so that thou art new?
[1:21:48] <Samex_Comex> New to goblin town
[1:21:52] <%octotasty> It's a compulsion
[1:22:24] <cinless> dragon has this weird goblin where every hour he goes outside and smokes a cigarette
[1:22:48] <Drakeotar> I believe in you both. Kick ass!
[1:23:10] <%octotasty> are you gonna summon Puppy Sif?
[1:24:23] <+Grim_McBonely> A whole generation accidentally addicted.
[1:24:28] <+Grim_McBonely> sad
[1:24:49] <cinless> i got real mad at miyazaki the first time i fought manus
[1:25:02] <+kingboro> he is putting his abyss in my catacombs!!!
[1:25:06] <zengumithecandymouse> plagueEggs
[1:26:00] <cinless> the timing of that made it look like manus just self destructed
[1:26:01] <%theloganbrand> Looked like Sif got the last strike
[1:26:04] <%octotasty> good dog
[1:26:18] <Watumean> Sif got the kill. good puppers
[1:26:24] <RickyRelucent> thats np, pets r disgusting
[1:26:32] <RickyRelucent> i should know, 16 cats and a doge
[1:27:08] <%KellBeII> theres also gwyndolin and pricilla if you want to bother with them
[1:27:27] <RickyRelucent> i uhh

[1:30:45] <Samex_Comex> They look like big strong hands. don't they
[1:30:47] <+sasparillatango> its nice to know the best ways to do some stuff
[1:31:52] <%KellBeII> move swap glitch is the layman term
[1:32:22] <RickyRelucent> the jump down to the lower burg LUL
[1:32:39] <%octotasty> disasters are gone!
[1:33:25] <cinless> bino glitch hits the ear like a slur
[1:33:25] <RickyRelucent> the 200 bucks one?
[1:33:35] <%KellBeII> in ds3 theres estus cancelling and it completely breaks the game
[1:33:45] <%KellBeII> totally removes recovery frames of healing
[1:34:08] <morcego_cinzento_arts> good evening
[1:34:19] <cinless> yeah because healing is so easy to punish without it
[1:34:30] <cinless> i'm not mad

[2:00:59] <%ralphwiggum16> I feel like Plague's guest is personally insulting me.
[2:01:42] <spiralpsyche> when you exist before time you might as well be psychic I guess
[2:01:57] <jetpack_rorschasch> Dragons are convoluted. Don't think about it.
[2:02:43] <%ralphwiggum16> So what? I shoot lightning out of my hands.
[2:02:51] <morcego_cinzento_arts> if sorcery in this universe came from a mutant scaleless dragon. psionics might as well be a thing for them

[2:03:37] <%KellBeII> the dash attack hit me multiple times for some reason

[2:06:06] <+sasparillatango> I fucking HATE DS 3
[2:06:08] <+CreggaMonsta> the one in 3. where you have to light the fires i think
[2:06:10] <morcego_cinzento_arts> hawk ele Gough is awesome but his weapon looks like shit.....literal shit
[2:06:11] <+thegoldenattack> hello
[2:06:12] <xxHungryxx> Giant enemy crabs
[2:06:13] <%Autarck> 3 isn't bad it just doesn't have the magic that ds1 I can't put my finger on it
[2:06:23] <twoah> I like the big tree guys aesthetically, but I can‚Äôt be bothered to learn how to fight them
[2:06:25] <jetpack_rorschasch> It's still better than 2 though.
[2:06:48] <%Autarck> Lol we don't need to talk about 2
[2:06:59] <+sasparillatango> No DS3 is shit because they were like "hey you know how all those frustrating moments in DS1 are remarkable and people remember them? what if we made the entire game that frustrating?"
[2:07:05] <hvzr2222> we already talked enough about two in the first stream
[2:07:49] <%KellBeII> ive always wondered how BB is coop.  I never wanted to give sony more money so i didnt get to play online
[2:08:52] <%ralphwiggum16> 3 confirms Solaire is the Nameless King!
[2:09:11] <plsletmemakeaccount> ds3 was so fucking stupid
[2:09:11] <%KellBeII> gwyn had two more children according to 3
[2:09:14] <plsletmemakeaccount> but i love it
[2:09:16] <SuperJollyGreen> remember demons souls ? Kappa
[2:09:19] <%KellBeII> painted world
[2:09:23] <Midnight188> 3 has some cool sights. i like irythill and the ringed city...
[2:09:27] <%nipplestheenchilada96> had to have had 3, only a middle child could be forgotten that thoroughly
[2:09:40] <Samex_Comex> It's about having a having pokemon and balancing your blood bank account
[2:09:47] <morcego_cinzento_arts> gwyn Loves to have unprotected pre marital sex
[2:10:32] <%ralphwiggum16> NOT NOW SWEETIE
[2:10:34] <xxHungryxx> lol
[2:10:36] <%PlebianNoob> Be honest though. If you could have sex with dragons, wouldn't you?
[2:10:39] <+TQuick101> Did you know nameless king had a name?
[2:10:42] <TheDastardlyD> that's so fucking cool
[2:10:42] <%nipplestheenchilada96> it was tucked under his sleeve
[2:10:56] <%theloganbrand> Every 7 minutes!
[2:11:02] <xxHungryxx> Nameless King was so non-conformist
[2:11:09] <%KellBeII> see i always liked to think that andre was the son of gwyn.  it made sense to me that he would retire to be a blacksmith nearby anor londo to maybe keep an eye on his former battle field buddies
[2:11:21] <+CreggaMonsta> we all would have sex with dragons if we could. dont lie
[2:11:24] <%KellBeII> and ds3 was just like nah its a dragon loving guy
[2:11:32] <morcego_cinzento_arts> not with DS dragons i wouldn't......unless if it's priscilla
[2:11:36] <%theloganbrand> Huh? Beserk?
[2:11:37] <oneeyedmercenary> Plague, what are your thoughts on DaS 3?
[2:11:59] <%nipplestheenchilada96> "lol" says miyazaki "lmao"

[2:17:06] <%theloganbrand> Do they only play with each other?
[2:17:10] <%PlebianNoob> Do they just play against each other?
[2:17:17] <Samex_Comex> A house with a den to watch the rain
[2:17:27] <cinless> you saying that sent out a psychic call
[2:17:32] <%ralphwiggum16> Drop-out dragon is mean.

[2:18:29] <twoah> The only pvp I do is dual bonewheel shields in full Kirk
[2:18:51] <+VentWilsn> him pretending to like 2 made his connection drop for a sec LUL
[2:19:19] <cinless> dragon is a very nice person and he loves it when you call him cutesy forms of dragon like dwagon or dergy
[2:19:23] <%nipplestheenchilada96> cathedral of the deep hurt me more than blight town and i don't know why
[2:19:27] <Drakeotar> I mean..drop-out dragon maybe mean but least he'd tell you the truth. I hope
[2:19:27] <%theloganbrand> He didn't join the call and call Plague an asshole. And if he did there's no proof.
[2:19:56] <xxHungryxx> Sometimes you need a mean person
[2:20:00] <%PlebianNoob> I started two, got to the boat cave or whatever and stopped
[2:20:03] <%ralphwiggum16> Drop-out Dragon, can we be friends?
[2:20:32] <plsletmemakeaccount> the first time I played 2 was two years ago, played through it all and all the dlcs, never touched it again.  it's not great
[2:21:21] <%jaypeesan> whoa the good old muffled mic dropout...been a while

[2:21:52] <Samex_Comex> Cheater cheater pumpkin eater
[2:21:58] <cinless> i remember when nic got like 200 dollars upon starting up fallout 76 with people begging him to play something else
[2:22:00] <xxHungryxx> Has there ever been an Assassin creed with ninjas?
[2:22:03] <spiralpsyche> imagine having such a fragile self concept that you get upset when other people have opinions.
[2:22:04] <cinless> than everyone went on to have a good time with it

[2:26:08] <Samex_Comex> Tee hee
[2:26:27] <TheDastardlyD> saying 'lol' to shit is sucha  bad habit
[2:26:28] <plsletmemakeaccount> trying to form connections
[2:26:30] <+VentWilsn> honestly, the rare times i heard rofl i thought i was hearing "waffle"
[2:26:34] <TheDastardlyD> for me
[2:26:40] <cinless> rofl is cringe, however i have learned to kill the part of me that cringes, not the part that is cringe
[2:26:44] <%Dakuu75> I wonder if even Pat and Paige can understand Plague sometimes
[2:27:15] <xxHungryxx> I do you lol, but when I do it is something that makes me genuinely laugh
[2:27:33] <%theloganbrand> The (reformed) council of bitching.
[2:27:35] <@TheDropOutDragon> Oh hey Plague.
[2:27:37] <Drakeotar> Honestly i prefer someoen being upfront with me. So i know if im doing something wrong. So i can fix it
[2:27:48] <cinless> wow i can't believe dragon hates plague
[2:27:49] <$Cobra743> period to me means i want you to read this and understand it
[2:28:02] <%theloganbrand> @TheDropOutDragon Damn this dude is about to be passive aggressive.
[2:28:15] <%Bigchill___> The multiple dots . . . have always felt like . . . people were annoyed
[2:28:19] <morcego_cinzento_arts> time for wheel fuckers

[2:28:23] <+VentWilsn> ...
[2:28:26] <Username_Error_Unknown> drama time
[2:28:33] <%Dakuu75> like... grammatical " ." or saying the word "period"?
[2:28:40] <cinless> that sentence reads to me like "Oh hey wheel skeleton."
[2:28:48] <twoah> Boomers and their inappropriately placed ellipses‚Ä¶ never gets old‚Ä¶
[2:29:01] <%Bigchill___> RATTLE ME BONES!
[2:29:01] <xxHungryxx> That time Dragon and Plague had an actual sword fight on a rooftop
[2:29:09] <+VentWilsn> i...cant...understand...your...accent
[2:29:13] <+TQuick101> poggers in the chat
[2:29:17] <tolloponik> @Dakuu75 grammar "."
[2:29:24] <%theloganbrand> The 40 minute video about bricks is the only good one.
[2:29:26] <$Cobra743> bald man builds fence, thats plague to 90% of the internet
[2:29:34] <+jaktheferret> trexRegrets
[2:29:40] <juan_wu_tamad> Plague is a bald man.
[2:29:40] <plsletmemakeaccount> plague's fanbase are all in their 30's
[2:29:42] <%theloganbrand> Plague's fanbase is all 'coomers'.
[2:29:44] <cinless> don't you want to get stanned, dragon?
[2:29:46] <whittacre> I miss the fence arc
[2:30:11] <cinless> i love how we evolved as a culture to the point where fanatic is no longer a strong enough word
[2:30:14] <%Dakuu75> gross

[2:30:41] <%TheLuckyWatcher> It's just a work, brother
[2:30:44] <%Dakuu75> "congrats, you thought the beef was fake, now it's real, go fuck yourself."
[2:30:45] <+AwkwardSnails> sounds like professional boxing

[2:37:14] <cinless> dunc
[2:37:25] <%PlebianNoob> Wonder why?
[2:37:33] <Drakeotar> Maybe they are reaaal bad episodes
[2:37:45] <%Cobra743> ever see that guy who put on a dry diving suit so he could get eaten alive by an anaconda?
[2:37:53] <cinless> free the pokemon james titty episode
[2:37:59] <twoah> I quite enjoyed Dune. The soundtrack is incredible
[2:38:04] <TigerCrownPorter> free the ash nearly getting shot episode
[2:38:15] <tolloponik> recess only has the first 2 seasons on Disney plus so it's worthless
[2:38:25] <morcego_cinzento_arts> i mais Sealab 2021
[2:38:34] <cinless> i hope i enjoy the movie and that they stop at this movie or the next movie
[2:38:37] <morcego_cinzento_arts> miss*
[2:38:45] <%PlebianNoob> James' titty episode in pokemon and there was one that never aired in us because apparently it had epilepsy problems
[2:38:50] <%Cobra743> worst book to film adaptation go
[2:39:11] <Samex_Comex> Don't you mean bizarro miss sealab 2021
[2:39:11] <%PlebianNoob> @Cobra743 I hated Eragon
[2:39:21] <cinless> the summaries don't do it justice
[2:39:27] <%Cobra743> @PlebianNoob same
[2:39:35] <plsletmemakeaccount> pretty sure the banned epilepsy episode is all over the internet now.  If anyone wants to gamble their life like I did, go watch it
[2:39:49] <cinless> nobody said a word dragon
[2:40:00] <twoah> Hot take Series of Unfortunate Events movie was disappointing
[2:40:00] <cinless> the scifi nerds aren't here, they can't hurt you
[2:40:01] <%GarrisonPrime> "Plz no explain" dodCool
[2:40:11] <%theloganbrand> Anne Rice hates everything
[2:40:12] <morcego_cinzento_arts> ghost stories straight up has a buried episode about the tear face ghost lady
[2:40:12] <Drakeotar> Noo dont kill her
[2:40:19] <%Cobra743> kill the waifu
[2:40:19] <cinless> oh anne rice is a fucking weird racist, don't listen to anything she says
[2:40:27] <Drakeotar> Noooo
[2:40:34] <Midnight188> no tail for you
[2:40:34] <%theloganbrand> Alan Moore will complain either way.
[2:40:35] <+illoonar> kill half-dragon feet woman
[2:40:39] <Samex_Comex> He's killing the fluffy lady!
[2:40:43] <%Bigchill___> I enjoyed the Eragon books alot.
[2:40:45] <spiralpsyche> oh man that eragon movie...
[2:40:45] <hvzr2222> killing the waifu
[2:40:47] <%Cobra743> to be fair the final book of the eragon books wasnt great either
[2:40:55] <morcego_cinzento_arts> Anni Rice hated the movie adaptation?
[2:40:56] <%GarrisonPrime> do it dragon
[2:40:58] <%GarrisonPrime> shill the book
[2:41:02] <spiralpsyche> I liked the books too. at least the first two anyway
[2:41:06] <%KellBeII> poor pricilla she just wants to haang out
[2:41:10] <ECRead> the ps2 game was strangely alright for a movie game tho
[2:41:12] <Drakeotar> I bought that book. Is there a chance to get it signed?
[2:41:15] <twoah> Goblet of Fire was a trash fire compared to the book
[2:41:16] <%GarrisonPrime> That poor man, he brings your nuggets
[2:41:22] <%GarrisonPrime> and this is how you repay him
[2:41:38] <hvzr2222> time to murder another old man
[2:41:53] <cinless> i forgot that there was a musical sting there that's so stupid
[2:42:05] <Samex_Comex> I thought that sound was coming from something else
[2:42:18] <plsletmemakeaccount> "oh we will"
[2:42:34] <+TQuick101> Percy Jackson movies
[2:42:35] <%KellBeII> gwyndolin?
[2:42:38] <morcego_cinzento_arts> i should watch Stardust. i heard it's a solid high fantasy movie
[2:42:41] <cinless> i have strong negative feelings about harry potter because of the author
[2:42:41] <Drakeotar> Plague has it. I liked the world and lots of magic
[2:42:52] <%theloganbrand> British school boy genre with some gothic and fantasy drippings
[2:42:57] <%GarrisonPrime> "No thats just a regular rat"
[2:43:00] <%PlebianNoob> How were they after 5? I fell asleep half way through and never went back
[2:43:02] <%Cobra743> i remember that the actor for Harry hates Harry Potter now cuz he's only ever known as harry potter
[2:43:12] <tolloponik> same with me, hunger games also was the same level of disinterest for me
[2:43:16] <+swesterly> No pig helmet, 2/10 lp
[2:43:24] <hvzr2222> one thing my dad said about HP that stuck with me was that the movies where they still were kids are the best cuz the world felt more magical
[2:43:25] <morcego_cinzento_arts> i despir-se Harry Potter cause the houses andhogwarts is stupid
[2:43:44] <%Bigchill___> Ever see the Wizards 1977 movie?
[2:43:46] <cinless> the sole asian character is named Cho Chang, that's the quality of writing we're dealing with
[2:43:47] <+swesterly> Malazan audiobooks are fucking lit
[2:43:56] <%KellBeII> did you want to bother gwyndolin?
[2:44:18] <%Cobra743> id be that guy in Ravenclaw trying to hookup an xbox to run off the magical internet
[2:44:27] <morcego_cinzento_arts> a wizard with a automatic rifle and a wand mounted underbarrel
[2:44:27] <+CreggaMonsta> its buy the guy who wrote the Martin.
[2:44:29] <%theloganbrand> My fave Potter book is my least fave movie and vice-versa. The movie cut out all the daily life shit.
[2:44:32] <Futurecity10> yes I play stellaris
[2:44:34] <+CreggaMonsta> according to the wiki
[2:44:52] <cinless> they don't have computers
[2:44:56] <Drakeotar> That sounds pretty rad of a book
[2:45:11] <cinless> it was written by Andy Weir, the guy who wrote The Martian
[2:45:11] <Drakeotar> Should i play stellaris?
[2:45:45] <%PlebianNoob> Is it just Patrick's pet rock?
[2:45:47] <%Cobra743> change the alien to be a sexy lady just with no eyes in the film probably
[2:45:54] <morcego_cinzento_arts> Enemy Mine movie added a evil miners section cause producers though the audi√™ncia would not get the title
[2:46:18] <%theloganbrand> Can you fuck it?
[2:46:24] <%Cobra743> yes
[2:46:24] <cinless> watch them just make the alien a hot woman with some rocky bits glued on her nipples
[2:46:27] <lewdnekojam> chuck E cheese can spare a suit f or that show
[2:46:35] <plsletmemakeaccount> you can fuck anything if you're horny enough
[2:46:50] <morcego_cinzento_arts> i want to see Elcor, Volus and Hanar more often
[2:47:04] <hvzr2222> could it be like the robots in animatrix where first they tried to act human but after humanity gave the middle finger they went full robot?
[2:47:14] <hvzr2222> *them
[2:47:31] <%Cobra743> the classic Fallout question. "What do they eat?"
[2:47:42] <fantom_flasch> corn and chicken
[2:47:44] <%PlebianNoob> Just not a story set in a world but the creator actually creates aninteresting world.
[2:47:52] <Drakeotar> Drop out dragon. I know this will trigger you but what do you think of uh hows it spelled. Esekai?
[2:48:06] <+NmyLogan> I love that argument when used against fallout 3
[2:48:07] <Profmcstevie> Isekai*
[2:48:28] <+V3RTIGO_222> hullo plague
[2:48:39] <%KellBeII> yoo
[2:48:39] <cinless> OH
[2:48:39] <%PlebianNoob> A lot of isekai doesn't go into that though.
[2:48:40] <morcego_cinzento_arts> Harry Potter suffers from being created by a Author just good enough to create a attractive ficcional world. but not good enough to polish it and make it stand long term
[2:48:42] <cinless> I RECOGNISE THAT
[2:48:46] <%KellBeII> thats my miracle resonance sign
[2:48:47] <cinless> that's one of those miracle rings
[2:48:48] <TigerCrownPorter> no its a white miracle ring
[2:48:55] <fantom_flasch> the other Fallout question is, "its been 200 years, sweep your shack floor you fucking animals!"
[2:49:04] <%KellBeII> i just healed there
[2:49:08] <cinless> it's from the gwynevere covenant isn't it?
[2:49:23] <morcego_cinzento_arts> kell' s miracle rabbit hole
[2:49:29] <cinless> i saw one once
[2:49:40] <%KellBeII> you never spoke to him after
[2:50:07] <Drakeotar> Honestly i thought you'd hate it
[2:50:12] <lewdnekojam> then you need Rance in your life
[2:50:13] <%theloganbrand> Isekai all just turns into 'we have to learn how to grow rice' if it goes long enough
[2:50:14] <+king_wragles> that knight basically got jumped
[2:50:20] <twoah> Still can‚Äôt believe they Isekai‚Äôd Monster Hunter. That movie hurt my soul
[2:50:23] <Profmcstevie> I'd rather enjoy the experience of somebody WANTING TO GO BACK
[2:50:25] <%Cobra743> im putting together a book that involves a completely subterranean fantasy world, the suface is a battlefield of gods and everyone who cant live in the middle of that hellscape fled underground, fast forward 20 generations, that war is still happening but what do the underground societies look like now?
[2:50:29] <fantom_flasch> the problem with Harry Potter is the original book was a Roald Dahlian world that was more about a whimsical atmosphere than a consistent world. then the books got more serious and the world building had to justify itself
[2:50:31] <cinless> i kind of like the spider isekai
[2:50:38] <Samex_Comex> I think the last one I watched was Inuyasha
[2:50:56] <%PlebianNoob> I like mushoku tensei
[2:50:57] <morcego_cinzento_arts> something that isn't a Isekai but has the samebad beats is Monster Girls Doctor
[2:50:59] <+king_wragles> it's previously title was "Serial Impregnation"
[2:51:14] <Drakeotar> This...anime sounds terrible. Why make it a anime and not just a hentai
[2:51:25] <$galthur_> The most impressive thing of isekai is that it‚Äôs gotten worse over time
[2:51:25] <cinless> oh gwyn
[2:51:27] <cinless> poor boy
[2:51:39] <Profmcstevie> "does not like mainstream garbage" goes for most media
[2:51:48] <+CreggaMonsta> he even has to get the men pregnant. its hard work
[2:51:53] <SuperVaderMan> Man rambles about impregnation Isekai while shitting on the Lord of Cinder
[2:51:53] <lewdnekojam> anime in most cases is the junk food  of the arts world
[2:52:11] <lewdnekojam> Rip undead santa
[2:52:14] <morcego_cinzento_arts> sunlight 4 life!
[2:52:14] <Drakeotar> Wow...he went down hard
[2:52:15] <fantom_flasch> bring the dark
[2:52:19] <+KiwiRedgrave> you live by the wog you die by the wog
[2:52:26] <$galthur_> The only good isekai is LOTM and that‚Äôs 1400 chapters so nobody‚Äôs reading that
[2:52:27] <fantom_flasch> yeyeye
[2:52:37] <spiralpsyche> dark lord hell yeah
[2:52:39] <%Cobra743> only anime i really enjoyed was hellsing, cuz the vampire was a monster and most problems were solved with a gun
[2:52:51] <cinless> i like linking the fire because that way i don't have to live in dark souls anymore
[2:52:55] <morcego_cinzento_arts> indeed cobra
[2:53:18] <Profmcstevie> anime sucks embrace the darkness fuck Gywn pattyDance
[2:53:23] <cinless> oh my god look at this chubby little boy
[2:53:27] <fantom_flasch> @plagueofgripes it's so convenient you can imitate the serpent voice so perfectly
[2:53:28] <Coystick> You are now king of the Penis Snakes
[2:53:28] <cinless> he's so proud
[2:53:30] <Samex_Comex> They are your harem
[2:53:32] <Drakeotar> Hey now. They might have explained it through items
[2:53:39] <SuperVaderMan> Ok so you become lord of darkness or whatever, what do you even do with it
[2:53:40] <lewdnekojam> @Rivalshotzgp my friend does. i wish we could make a discord support group for guys like him
[2:53:43] <%theloganbrand> yea but the giants though
[2:53:57] <morcego_cinzento_arts> never explanado their fleshy sack mustaches
[2:53:58] <%Cobra743> butterfly wings
[2:54:17] <%KellBeII> it was fun
[2:54:18] <%theloganbrand> WE did it.
[2:54:25] <+CreggaMonsta> frankh1Stoney
[2:54:27] <lewdnekojam> enjoy?
[2:54:27] <%Bigchill___> First time completing this, right?
[2:54:30] <%Cobra743> yes
[2:54:31] <SuperVaderMan> Can't believe this man beat dark souls, on stream
[2:54:32] <tolloponik> now for the slog of ds2
[2:54:33] <SAP_TheLazySamurai_SCRUB> Do a soup laddle run on DS2
[2:54:38] <%Cobra743> cuz you love suffering
[2:54:39] <plsletmemakeaccount> just do more santa invasions
[2:54:39] <%KellBeII> 2 is a little easier to play around in coop i think
[2:54:42] <@Nightbot> Plague is a youtube animator and also streams at https://picarto.tv/Plague . Also: t-shirts! http://goo.gl/lze8QO
[2:54:43] <lewdnekojam> plagueNYA plagueNYA
[2:54:47] <Samex_Comex> Play Kings field
[2:54:47] <drakulven> do it, show me up
[2:54:48] <Drakeotar> You shouldnt stream it if its like going to make you mad
[2:54:57] <%PlebianNoob> I liked when you guys played it for memes
[2:55:08] <%KellBeII> could also get the demons souls emulation and play on the private server
[2:55:16] <cinless> and the dlc go on for fucking ever
[2:55:32] <PonchoPronto> I wanna watch footage of the ds2 network test again, it looked like it felt great when I first saw that
[2:55:54] <%Cobra743> lets add more statues in scholars, enjoy remembering where the branches of yor are fuckers
[2:56:01] <ScreamLord> I never forgave From Soft for obliterating Faith and Magic builds in DS2
[2:56:05] <tolloponik> ds3 was the only game I finished sadly because 3 doesn't really have that many fuck you areas
[2:56:32] <+sasparillatango> what do you mean OK saure, those in  LOS enemies lowering your health at range is HORSESHIT
[2:56:38] <%Cobra743> the dog pit after the Belfry
[2:56:39] <cinless> those rats have infinite poise break
[2:56:41] <+SilverDevilfish> The rolly polly fire breathing lizards
[2:56:41] <morcego_cinzento_arts> The prison in the profane capital?
[2:56:46] <+SilverDevilfish> with their headbutts
[2:56:48] <+liquidzr0> shofuMillyrock
[2:57:18] <%yendoria> shofuMillyrock ?
[2:57:22] <cinless> the fucking madman actually put guns in dark souls, and coded that shit from scratch
[2:57:24] <ECRead> Cinders and Convergence are both pretty good
[2:57:37] <cinless> didn't just reskin crossbows, made honest to god guns
[2:57:39] <morcego_cinzento_arts> cinder makes  magic more useable, i think
[2:57:58] <%Cobra743> cindrs does a lot of things
[2:57:59] <%KellBeII> 2011
[2:58:01] <+TridentBerryBurst> I hope they don't include screaming enemies in Elden Ring. All the screaming enemies in DS3 got really old after a while
[2:58:07] <%KellBeII> its 10 years old
[2:58:08] <copyritetm> 2011 actually, the dlc was 2012
[2:58:14] <Samex_Comex> Make a new Armored Core
[2:58:17] <fantom_flasch> prepare to die was 2012?
[2:58:49] <%Cobra743> i remember 9/11 and that makes me a boomer to some people
[2:58:50] <Drakeotar> I know i would be dead without medical science
[2:59:04] <cinless> nah a alchemist woulda fixed you up with some mercury and a vomit pill you woulda been fine
[2:59:11] <fantom_flasch> most people who need glasses would have a shitty time of it
[2:59:13] <tolloponik> @Samex_Comex there have been talks about armored core after Elden ring but its such a hard maybe
[2:59:19] <plsletmemakeaccount> oh right I had spinal menigitis when I was an infant
[2:59:29] <plsletmemakeaccount> really fucked with my eyesight
[2:59:47] <hvzr2222> Hello again, what did i miss
[2:59:49] <morcego_cinzento_arts> i would have a routh time without glasses
[2:59:58] <%KellBeII> @hvzr2222 the ending
[3:00:12] <ECRead> ouch
[3:00:38] <Samex_Comex> God they show a trailer for a new Armored core and the AC dose a Dark Souls roll
[3:00:42] <Drakeotar> nice kill!
[3:00:47] <fantom_flasch> maybe 20-30 year will give bionic shoulders
[3:00:49] <plsletmemakeaccount> hey they kicked acl tears a new one, there's hope
[3:01:13] <%Cobra743> no become toilet

[3:01:17] <Mathochism> SIGN ME UP!
[3:01:17] <%theloganbrand> Sparkledog comes standard
[3:01:23] <%Cobra743> become toilet
[3:01:23] <Profmcstevie> "A neon wolf? fuuuuck" said 99% of the population
[3:01:23] <hvzr2222> reminds me of gabe newell and the brain interface thing
[3:01:27] <Drakeotar> Is this a movie reference?
[3:01:28] <tolloponik> toilet immortality
[3:01:38] <cinless> at this rate you're going to transfer your mind into elon musk's internet 3.0 sweatshop
[3:01:43] <%Cobra743> live forever as neon toilet
[3:01:46] <fantom_flasch> not the fursona you want, but the fursona you deserve
[3:02:00] <+liquidzr0> probably wont be able to transfer but might be a SOMA situation
[3:02:10] <Drakeotar> I was thinking Soma this whole time
[3:02:12] <%KellBeII> at least its not neon purple
[3:02:22] <Samex_Comex> Black light dick?
[3:02:27] <%Cobra743> id tranfer into a quadrepedal body, shake things up
[3:02:27] <%theloganbrand> new record.
[3:02:28] <Drakeotar> No Drop out you mentioned Furrys earlier
[3:02:49] <Drakeotar> You were talking about how Furry artists or tubers would start beef just for the show
[3:02:52] <plsletmemakeaccount> what if it required your eyelids to be glow in the dark, meaning you could never have a restful sleep again
[3:02:59] <morcego_cinzento_arts> furries have a peculiar relationship with neon RGB
[3:03:07] <Drakeotar> Aaaah. Okay that is a difference
[3:03:38] <Samex_Comex> Spyro 2
[3:03:38] <whiteboyz123> dark souls 2
[3:03:41] <+liquidzr0> DS2
[3:03:42] <Mathochism> Nioh 2 sounds great, lol.
[3:03:45] <cinless> i want to see the inside of my eyelids
[3:03:50] <%KellBeII> ehh, ds2, demons, or bb
[3:03:51] <%Cobra743> Octopath Traveler
[3:03:52] <salsache> ds2 would kick ass
[3:03:56] <jetpack_rorschasch> DS3
[3:04:02] <morcego_cinzento_arts> Destroy All Humans remake
[3:04:07] <+TQuick101> You liked the game plague? fuck you
[3:04:19] <Drakeotar> Long as you dont play a David cage game
[3:04:35] <%Cobra743> Beyond 2 Fucks
[3:04:37] <%Bigchill___> Everyone bandwagon onto DS2 and help plague
[3:04:38] <cinless> oh god i'd love to watch you play some david cage games
[3:04:53] <%whimwhisp> Play something you'll enjoy? Or something you've be curious about?
[3:04:54] <BluffRainbow> But David cage games are da bes @drakeotar
[3:04:58] <plsletmemakeaccount> nioh 2 probably will too
[3:05:00] <morcego_cinzento_arts> play ze bad game and rage at ze bad game
[3:05:01] <%whimwhisp> you've been*
[3:05:05] <Brunothebodyguard> sup
[3:05:18] <%Cobra743> the succubus boss destroyed my enjoyment of Nioh 1
[3:05:40] <peasy_> dodWoke
[3:05:41] <Brunothebodyguard> @plagueofgripes you still upload streams to the unlisted playlist?
[3:06:27] <cinless> dread is a direct sequel to fusion
[3:06:39] <%Cobra743> Shadow of the Colossus
[3:06:43] <plsletmemakeaccount> reminds me of metroid prime and how difficult some of the encounters could be for no reason
[3:07:07] <Samex_Comex> I like the castlevania games more
[3:07:28] <%Cobra743> wait for the spin, get one hit repeat
[3:07:31] <SuperVaderMan> I want to hear plague complain about the writing of whatever he plays next
[3:07:37] <Drakeotar> ...I feel bad now that i loved the visuals of Nioh and had fun with it.
[3:07:38] <+illoonar> @Cobra743 this
[3:07:42] <%theloganbrand> It might be a little long but FFX streams might be cool.
[3:07:57] <%Bigchill___> PS4
[3:08:00] <ECRead> 4
[3:08:02] <%JayCantDo> what about fallout?
[3:08:07] <%PlebianNoob> 4
[3:08:09] <jetpack_rorschasch> Ps4
[3:08:12] <+FlynsArmy> @PlagueOfGripes Ever planning on doing an In Summary for 2/3? GF and I quote #1 all the time
[3:08:24] <BluffRainbow> What‚Äôs the chances of @plagueofgripes playing ‚Äúmischief makers‚Äù for the n64
[3:08:32] <PonchoPronto> play ps2 version for the purple skies, of course mangoReddit
[3:08:33] <Samex_Comex> Defenders of the oasis
[3:08:36] <+E66z> Shadow of the Colossus would be a sick Plague playthrough
[3:08:37] <%PlebianNoob> Journey is a wonderful game
[3:08:50] <tolloponik> what about Snoot Game :)
[3:09:09] <morcego_cinzento_arts> kill all fish with a hot knife
[3:09:11] <NachoSuplexSupreme_> In Summary: Yeah nah lmao
[3:09:12] <+NmyLogan> you have any more bloodborne animations in the pipeline?
[3:09:20] <chidory000> any Yakuza game
[3:09:22] <+NmyLogan> or hell any animations?
[3:09:24] <plsletmemakeaccount> the in summary for 3 would just be the same as one except now with a painter and a new daughter
[3:09:28] <Samex_Comex> Chrono trigger
[3:09:33] <%PlebianNoob> X-2?
[3:09:39] <cinless> alright i'm going my ass to bed y'all have fun
[3:09:41] <%Cobra743> i like ffx but i wish to god you could skip the cutscenes
[3:09:46] <morcego_cinzento_arts> plague mastered blitzball
[3:09:53] <Drakeotar> You could play Cuphead with Drop out
[3:10:12] <%Bigchill___> I feel 12 was better than people remember.
[3:10:13] <%theloganbrand> I like grinding in X-2, even if that encounter rate is too damn high. I love the job shit.
[3:10:14] <spiralpsyche> systems building is 100% the reason I like FFXII
[3:11:06] <+NmyLogan> eidolons are dumb
[3:11:35] <morcego_cinzento_arts> i wish Chaos Legion was better.
[3:12:06] <Drakeotar> Dragons Dogma maybe?  Im just spit balling ideas from my own steam library
[3:12:38] <crossolead> Plague have you ever thought about playing any deckbuilding games like slay the spire or inscryption
[3:12:40] <spiralpsyche> Dragons Dogma!
[3:12:45] <morcego_cinzento_arts> i'm marginally good at drawing and mildly bad at games
[3:12:55] <%Ynkubus_> 2022 if the leak is true i beleive
[3:12:58] <%PlebianNoob> Devinity?
[3:13:01] <tolloponik> the dmc 5 team is working on it now that DMC5 is done
[3:13:11] <Samex_Comex> The wave is pushing me!
[3:13:42] <+sasparillatango> I should play through with that mod, I hated stat growth
[3:13:54] <Samex_Comex> Flying into free!
[3:14:01] <%Cobra743> DS3 respec is rage inducing
[3:14:04] <+sasparillatango> Dragon's Dogma was a great game with a few problems.  I loved the combat
[3:14:17] <+sasparillatango> Fournval!
[3:14:17] <morcego_cinzento_arts> plague in one of the past stream you mentioned that Dragons dogma had better magic
[3:14:37] <spiralpsyche> ~Like a dangan~
[3:14:56] <@Nightbot> Plague is a youtube animator and also streams at https://picarto.tv/Plague . Also: t-shirts! http://goo.gl/lze8QO
[3:15:07] <+sasparillatango> I wish Bitter Black Island was more like a chalice dungeon, that would be rad

[3:16:37] <+cubbywolf> soft feminine hands of an artist farmer
[3:16:45] <+cubbywolf> a farmer  artist
[3:16:47] <AncelDeLambert> if you are tepid on either of those concepts then eh
[3:16:49] <%Cobra743> top is fed
[3:16:51] <+cubbywolf> an artist farmer is something else
[3:16:52] <plsletmemakeaccount> a farmist
[3:16:59] <pleochronic> a fartist
[3:17:01] <Samex_Comex> Delicate pure hands
[3:17:08] <+cubbywolf> arsonist
[3:17:17] <Drakeotar> I know the dropout. He is a cool dude
[3:17:18] <ttc_lover> Hello Dragon
[3:17:45] <%Dakuu75> I like stream guests. they offer banter~
[3:18:03] <%PlebianNoob> How many last playthroughs have there been?
[3:18:14] <%Murphio_GS> plagueHeh Only suffering
[3:18:44] <+Them00n> While I know Plague likes Dark Souls, I don't know any reason why that is. I've literally only heard him complain about it.
[3:18:47] <tanarath> play nioh 2
[3:18:51] <Samex_Comex> Souls Anonymous
[3:18:55] <%PlebianNoob> What do you play now, dragon?
[3:19:49] <%Cobra743> more story bad?
[3:19:53] <tolloponik> I have literally heard nothing about Valhalla it just came and went
[3:20:18] <SAP_TheLazySamurai_SCRUB> Damn, I just got a flashback to BillyMC
[3:20:21] <Drakeotar> I wanna play total warhammer threee
[3:20:22] <+Mrbaconator> yo khorn and tzeentch look fucking nuts in TW2
[3:20:26] <+Mrbaconator> 3
[3:20:28] <+Mrbaconator> not 2
[3:20:40] <%Puhff> play meet'n'fuck
[3:20:48] <%Murphio_GS> Dying Light implicates there's a Living Dark
[3:21:32] <Drakeotar> Honestly i am looking forward to Khorne units but thats only cause there my fave besides Tzeentch
[3:21:33] <+Mrbaconator> khorn spawns free snowballing giant armies that spawn with movement from destroying settlements and you can teleport your main army places
[3:22:13] <%theloganbrand> "Crumbchugger_cookiefan makes a good point here"
[3:22:20] <%Murphio_GS> Like I did
[3:22:24] <plsletmemakeaccount> I chose this name for obvious reasons
[3:22:26] <%Cobra743> mine was just simple and i based it on a snake clock i had as a kid\
[3:22:34] <BooitsDock> oh damn...
[3:22:35] <Samex_Comex> Dusty Gozongas
[3:22:45] <+Mrbaconator> "HornyMilf42069XD that was a really poetic point about the middle east"

[3:22:46] <+Kaask> booba
[3:22:47] <whiteboyz123> BOOBA
[3:23:01] <forumbug74> i've had this name for like 12 years
[3:23:30] <Username_Error_Unknown> poo poo pee pee man still haunts my dreams
[3:23:30] <vonmaultke> "LongDong69 invades" thats a RIP mate
[3:23:32] <Drakeotar> "Crackaddictstookmyfamily." Is one of my faves
[3:23:34] <+Mrbaconator> i literally stole this name from a kid at boyscout camp who said it was his xbox gamer tag and i liked it so much i have used it for everything ever since
[3:23:52] <forumbug74> BONK
[3:24:16] <%Dakuu75> My dad yells at telemarketers, curses them out. I just block the numbers
[3:24:26] <Drakeotar> You know dropout my grandpa does that. He says he is retired and has so much free time to screw with them
[3:24:30] <tolloponik> bight a burger while your talking to them
[3:24:39] <tolloponik> bite*
[3:24:46] <SAP_TheLazySamurai_SCRUB> People still answer the phone when they don't recognize the number?
[3:24:53] <%Cobra743> or just have my phone send any unknown callers to voicemall
[3:24:58] <%Dakuu75> LMAO~!!
[3:25:08] <forumbug74> if i had a nickel for every Chinese telemarketer dood
[3:25:20] <terminusterminal> Just answer and then take a shit while you talk to them
[3:25:29] <terminusterminal> Bring the wireless phone in with you
[3:25:46] <%Dakuu75> HAHAHAHAAAA
[3:25:51] <SAP_TheLazySamurai_SCRUB> I did that when a political party rep called me
[3:25:59] <plsletmemakeaccount> it'll really tie the story all together, especially the parts that made no sense
[3:26:00] <+Them00n> Pretending to be a minor is a good way to freak out telemarketers.
[3:26:00] <SAP_TheLazySamurai_SCRUB> it was also 10:45pm
[3:26:28] <tolloponik> like a toriyama interview
[3:26:40] <%KellBeII> just like a wheel skeleton he exists to cause pain
[3:26:47] <jetpack_rorschasch> And then he shows everyone his cool new bong. LUL
[3:27:09] <+Mrbaconator> I feel like "create yet another new installment" is different than "literally finish what you said you would"
[3:27:39] <plsletmemakeaccount> yeah they will
[3:27:51] <fluffy_sauce> fanfic doesn't count as 'real' writing
[3:28:03] <Drakeotar> Im still free ;3
[3:28:04] <%KellBeII> youre cuter than paige at least, its been confirmed by a poll
[3:28:05] <peasy_> i wouldnt cll them jokes
[3:28:05] <Samex_Comex> Santa is not pleased
[3:28:06] <%Bigchill___> Plague is handsome plagueFace
[3:28:08] <%Murphio_GS> The jokes: Cum
[3:28:09] <Drakeotar> only cause no one wants me
[3:28:11] <+sasparillatango> old lady telemarketer bits
[3:28:24] <cricket42069> well if you're not writing anymore i guess i'll spend my 40 million dollars somewhere else
[3:28:27] <tolloponik> most manga artist draw porn on the side to get money and noticed by publishers
[3:28:34] <peasy_> m64Perfect
[3:28:43] <forumbug74> where we dropin?
[3:29:10] <@TheDropOutDragon> TheThing
[3:29:13] <terminusterminal> Like pogchamp
[3:29:15] <%Murphio_GS> that would be bizzare
[3:29:19] <%Murphio_GS> honestly
[3:29:20] <%Dakuu75> there's probably lots of those

[3:30:03] <%CreggaMonsta> @justcallmebobplease thanks bob
[3:30:17] <+V3RTIGO_222> good strem, very content
[3:30:24] <+V3RTIGO_222> how are peeps?
[3:30:39] <plsletmemakeaccount> oh right, he's still playing the game
[3:30:52] <%Murphio_GS> plagueLUL
[3:30:57] <tolloponik> wow that ds2 faith damage right there
[3:31:22] <+V3RTIGO_222> you should have cock slammed those guys, your dong is a bigger and better weapon that that hammer
[3:31:45] <+V3RTIGO_222> I n f I n I t e
[3:31:47] <%Dakuu75> the Elden Ring mechanic of getting enemies to fight each other looks neat
[3:32:04] <toemanjon11> do it just to fucj your isp
[3:32:06] <+illoonar> I liked fucking around in Dark Messiah of Might & Magic
[3:32:24] <+V3RTIGO_222> if there's one horrible enemy I like the most from Souls, it's the Mimic
[3:32:32] <Drakeotar> I'd probably watch it.
[3:32:39] <+NmyLogan> ganked
[3:32:44] <+V3RTIGO_222> rip
[3:32:55] <%Murphio_GS> Estus powder didn't work
[3:32:59] <+NmyLogan> you and me both
[3:33:01] <plsletmemakeaccount> infinite
[3:33:06] <+V3RTIGO_222> ew destiny
[3:33:10] <+NmyLogan> destiny does not respect your time or your money
[3:33:10] <Drakeotar> I liked Destiny for the worlds but not really anything else
[3:33:12] <+V3RTIGO_222> gross
[3:33:27] <%Murphio_GS> Hey Plague did you know there's a political streamer named Destiny?
[3:33:33] <Drakeotar> Then destiny 2 got rid of like 50% of its content
[3:33:41] <the_musko> What weapon is that
[3:33:49] <the_musko> not the dragon tooth is it
[3:33:51] <+V3RTIGO_222> cursed not-halo mmo-rpg-fps
[3:34:03] <+Mrbaconator> destiny 2 is real bad
[3:34:09] <+Mrbaconator> so many problems
[3:34:22] <+Mrbaconator> doc buford has a fantastic essay on it
[3:34:25] <spiralpsyche> warframe is fun because I'm a  cyborg ninja
[3:34:25] <+V3RTIGO_222> at least infinite plays well, it's actually fun
[3:34:26] <whittacre> warframe has problems, destiny is intrinsically broken
[3:34:29] <toemanjon11> Destiny is a good game to just hang with people in, like the actual game itself is pretty bad, but it's mindless enough that you can just talk to friends
[3:35:09] <%Cobra743> Plague i say this small piece with genuine kindness, i like your content cuz your a fellow country bumpkin who hates many of the same things i do. Your stuff has gotten me through many of a long day.
[3:35:11] <SAP_TheLazySamurai_SCRUB> Warframe lets you choose a weapon that you like, and mod it. Destiny says, "You like this weapon? Guess what, you won't get another one for 20 levels, and you better not think of trying to use under level equipment"
[3:35:34] <%Murphio_GS> Oh god old school Ventrilo
[3:35:39] <+V3RTIGO_222> destiny had one main problem in my eyes: when I shoot things in the face, I want them to die
[3:36:15] <+V3RTIGO_222> bulletsponges are cursed
[3:36:36] <SAP_TheLazySamurai_SCRUB> Yeah, most weapons felt that they lacked any real impact
[3:37:10] <%Puhff> yeah that's a good thing
[3:37:14] <%Dakuu75> lol
[3:37:21] <forumbug74> P A I N
[3:37:34] <%octotasty> Oh, you went into NG+
[3:37:36] <+Them00n> What else would you guys complain about without the Dark Soul
[3:37:52] <%Murphio_GS> Aboat?
[3:37:56] <+JGardner03> Raids are predetermined sequences really
[3:38:01] <%Murphio_GS> Talking to pat and paige for long enough eh?
[3:38:02] <+V3RTIGO_222> it suffered from the fact that the skill based component was vastly overwritten by number management
[3:38:14] <+V3RTIGO_222> big number is better
[3:39:03] <SAP_TheLazySamurai_SCRUB> That puts it into words, better than my angry noises ever could
[3:39:07] <+Them00n> Broke: MMOs Woke: Tabletop RPGs
[3:39:13] <%PlebianNoob> Is this a speed run now?
[3:39:14] <%KellBeII> nice
[3:39:30] <%Dakuu75> this is bad news bears
[3:39:40] <plsletmemakeaccount> do the snakes count as scalies?
[3:40:36] <%Dakuu75> lol
[3:40:49] <%PlebianNoob> It's just a cycle anyway. Who cares
[3:41:47] <forumbug74> woof
[3:41:50] <plsletmemakeaccount> me with every dark souls game
[3:41:59] <Jimmyla> can I swear here?
[3:42:05] <%Cobra743> mechanically 2 is great, but oh my god could they have not made 80% of the enemies humanoids with weapons?
[3:42:09] <velgaduere> @Jimmyla fuck no
[3:42:17] <%Dakuu75> I miss the games I use to enjoy. (I still remember having good times but, I wouldn't go back.)
[3:42:21] <+SveriSageAdvice> if DS2 didnt force you to pump levels into Adaptability just to have a normal speed for all your abilities, i might've liked it more
[3:42:45] <velgaduere> your swear has no power here
[3:42:45] <plsletmemakeaccount> he said swear not slur
[3:42:45] <whiteboyz123> ^
