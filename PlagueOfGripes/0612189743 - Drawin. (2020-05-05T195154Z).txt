[0:22:11] <sonofthedeepsouth> A yes the fur covered Nipple, we meet again
[0:22:24] <sonofthedeepsouth> Hi everyone
[0:22:24] <+jesusverm> jesusverm subscribed with Twitch Prime. 
[0:23:24] <irishcraftsman> swell @sonofthedeepsouth
[0:23:42] <GarbageNirvana> Surprised this ain't on picarto all things considered
[0:23:42] <thelazydead> damn what song was that?
[0:23:51] <sonofthedeepsouth> Ripped Jesus>>>> all other jesus
[0:24:04] <Shardelre> blue ridge mountains by fleet foxes
[0:24:09] <Karrrasu> I too saw that episode
[0:24:26] <%jesusverm> but what about mecha jesus from AVGN?
[0:24:34] <sonofthedeepsouth> What if Jesus was a gym rat?
[0:24:59] <sonofthedeepsouth> Would he have broken the cross like that meme image?
[0:25:29] <GarbageNirvana> Did they even have gyms in Jesustimes?
[0:25:44] <sonofthedeepsouth> They had sport centers
[0:25:51] <sonofthedeepsouth> not only for gladiators
[0:25:53] <%CaptHat211> He walked everywhere.
[0:25:55] <Frogwash> they had manual labor
[0:26:07] <%CaptHat211> Land, water...
[0:26:08] <Karrrasu> yes they called them gymnasiums
[0:26:23] <Karrrasu> plus they naturally had lots of toil
[0:27:00] <midnightmadness32> How is everyone's day going?
[0:27:05] <%Saltyjub> Saltyjub subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 2 months, currently on a 1 month streak! Yo, Eli. Doing some in-between frames for work. I may or may not lose my job as an animator and designer at a games company, but those are the times we live in. Learning from your colour palettes was one of the reasons I got this job to begin with, thanks
[0:27:07] <sonofthedeepsouth> The only thing that I see that could hinder people getting swelled back then would be a lack of protein in the diet
[0:27:18] <sonofthedeepsouth> but that would vary from region to region
[0:28:14] <Zalthin> Whats this? UwU
[0:28:20] <sonofthedeepsouth> Out of touch
[0:28:25] <sonofthedeepsouth> Notices nothing
[0:29:06] <+PleasantLee> you're out of tooouch, I'm outta tiiiime
[0:29:06] <lost_fortune> I always hear entertainment is a recession safe career, have I been lied to? Have I made a mistake?
[0:29:34] <+bear_breaker20> so much fan art for a character thats one boss fight I think ?
[0:29:34] <case01> case01 subscribed with Twitch Prime. 
[0:29:57] <+bear_breaker20> the devs knew what people wanted
[0:30:40] <midnightmadness32> What character is this? What's she from?
[0:30:57] <+bear_breaker20> trials of mana
[0:31:39] <+PleasantLee> so if you like that character before the reveal you're a secret furry?
[0:32:05] <+bear_breaker20> nah it she jsut drags you into the closet
[0:32:16] <+bear_breaker20> not out
[0:33:18] <Jetstream_Senpai> Do backups for the streams on Picarto exist, except the VoD on Picarto itself? Sorry to bother
[0:33:54] <Huntercd> Once again the music is banging
[0:34:03] <+PleasantLee> that last video on picarto wont work past like 7 minutes for me, real pain in the balls
[0:34:11] <Jetstream_Senpai> Thank you very much!

[0:38:37] <zecaptain_james> i hope you having a great day Plague!
[0:38:53] <%Saltyjub> Oh, I know it's Heart, the first part was just so goddamn rad
[0:39:28] <%CaptHat211> L'Oréal: Because I'm Worth It
[0:40:45] <Frogwash> Stabbing
[0:40:52] <%CaptHat211> It can be good or bad
[0:40:57] <zecaptain_james> sexy time +1
[0:40:57] <+cappyd33> level 3 wake up super
[0:41:00] <+littleogre92> What your drawing is a pretty good example
[0:41:01] <eyezehuhh> claiming someone on their taxes
[0:41:30] <%Saltyjub> Is there an album where THAT live version of Crazy on You is on?
[0:41:30] <Quiet__Viking> Shading that hair looks like it'll be a real pain in the ass to do
[0:41:32] <Presence_Eternal> Like that saying "Always stick it in crazy."
[0:41:37] <YakumoYomi> I'm not exactly sure what I'm looking at...only that I like it.
[0:41:39] <%Samex_Comex> Jumping on you and shrieking like a monkey?
[0:41:39] <+Scevda> Eat my face.
[0:43:29] <+Heart0fInk> Eat Pant
[0:44:51] <+EyeFarted> Hey @plagueofgripes . Hey fellow perverts. Who's being drawn today?
[0:45:21] <Treuan> You ever feel like maybe Plague's art is lewd?
[0:45:23] <%CaptHat211> @Scevda Its always "step on me", "eat my face", or "hurt me in some unpleasant manner". Its never "have wild sex w/ me" or "have a meaningful relationship w/ me".
[0:46:20] <%Saltyjub> Alone slaps pretty hard, Eli
[0:46:21] <+bear_breaker20> this songs good too, sounds like a pillow
[0:46:48] <Quiet__Viking> @EyeFarted I've been messing around with new brushes
[0:47:04] <%Saltyjub> Yes, I know, that was the stupid that reeked off that comment
[0:47:33] <lost_fortune> you have a playlist?
[0:47:34] <+stinkomeanie> Heeeey Plague is drawing! You son of a gun PixelBob
[0:48:32] <@Nightbot> Plague is a youtube animator and also streams at https://picarto.tv/Plague . Also: t-shirts! http://goo.gl/lze8QO
[0:49:20] <+stinkomeanie> Ever sense the song Benny Mardones I've wanted to make a playlist of songs about girls under 18
[0:49:45] <+stinkomeanie> Like Seventeen by Winger
[0:49:58] <Treuan> It was a different time
[0:51:02] <+stinkomeanie> Would Girl, You'll be a woman soon by Neil Diamond count?
[0:51:26] <+stinkomeanie> Rush?
[0:51:48] <ScreamLord> Who's this...insistent lady?
[0:51:52] <+Lonewolf2840> so........FURRIES @PlagueOfGripes
[0:51:55] <Huntercd> Paul simon
[0:52:08] <+bear_breaker20> sounds like he wins smash tourneys
[0:52:24] <+Heart0fInk> Can there be less songs about pedophilia in the world?
[0:52:41] <%CaptHat211> *holds lighter*
[0:52:46] <+Heart0fInk> know what? can there be less pedophilia in the world?
[0:52:49] <+stinkomeanie> What would we call this playlist if it was ever made? In theory?
[0:52:59] <Huntercd> Technically its hebephilia
[0:53:05] <lost_fortune> there's nothing more pleasant than listening to sad love song while looking at furry art
[0:53:10] <+stinkomeanie> ^^^ found one
[0:53:13] <+stinkomeanie> jk
[0:53:24] <%Samex_Comex> I can try and make a playlist some time, I have herd enough of your songs and I can get the other Gripelings to help
[0:53:28] <+stinkomeanie> lmao @lost_fortune
[0:53:55] <Huntercd> She's a cat or a fox lady?
[0:54:01] <ScreamLord> Is this Krystals insane, nudist sister or something?
[0:54:22] <Karrrasu> I donated, 1 discord link ?
[0:54:56] <+stinkomeanie> I'm too old for Discord
[0:55:05] <~PlagueOfGripes> https://discord.gg/kkZHSp
[0:55:17] <Karrrasu> thanks : )
[0:55:41] <asurite_warrior> Is plague do actual porn or is it only like the implied or just before stuff?
[0:55:47] <asurite_warrior> does
[0:55:48] <BigNerdSam> I just tuned in thinking "Oh Plague is drawing, what could it be?" and I see implications of furry tits.
[0:56:01] <+stinkomeanie> Titillation
[0:56:14] <+Heart0fInk> "sexually aggressive animal"
[0:56:14] <stfn893> Hmmmmm
[0:56:19] <+stinkomeanie> That Patsy Cline?!
[0:56:23] <BigNerdSam> It's not porn, it's the *implications*.
[0:56:45] <Curopium> This is the most sexually aggressive not-porn I have seen
[0:57:03] <BigNerdSam> I dunno, I've seen Monster Musume.
[0:57:10] <+Scevda> Curo, you aint seen nothing yet.
[0:57:42] <SoFarFetched> I just came in and was not disappointed
[0:57:50] <+BopBeep> Shame this guy has a bad case of pant tent, must be very embarrassing.
[0:57:54] <ScreamLord> I think for Plague it's like this. Human women's bodies are more interesting to draw, but animal head are also more interesting to draw. There for; Furry Art
[0:58:07] <+stinkomeanie> hmmm yes unified, i understand art jargon too
[0:58:21] <+brandon_ks> @stinkomeanie, I LIKE LITTLE GIRLS - Oingo Boingo
[0:58:31] <+stinkomeanie> ooooh good one @brandon_ks
[0:58:56] <+stinkomeanie> Weird Science song
[0:58:57] <+brandon_ks> i actually really like that song
[0:59:23] <%case01> Oh shit what this thundercat cover?
[0:59:29] <FennecZephyr> This seems borderline too spicy for twitch
[0:59:30] <%Samex_Comex> I like Dead man's party
[0:59:39] <%case01> what is*
[0:59:42] <S4boar> oh snap, this song. what is this?
[1:00:20] <zecaptain_james> love your art plague, i don't get to catch your streams often.
[1:00:46] <WolfeeDee> I just finished watching your YT video! Wasn't expecting to see you live. How often are you live? @PlagueOfGripes
[1:00:52] <stfn893> I like this cover than the actual version
[1:01:12] <HelluvaNohbody> I almost thought it was gonna play the Carl Weezer version
[1:01:26] <+stinkomeanie> This song reminds me of K-Ci & JoJo
[1:01:34] <SoFarFetched> He's either on here drawing,or he's drawing on Picarto while watching Star Trek with Pat and Paige.
[1:02:53] <+rawringkhris> did I hear that right? peanut butter chocolate cake with kool aid?
[1:03:52] <GarbageQueenEllie> Was the songwriter high?
[1:04:07] <SoFarFetched> New songs? what are those?
[1:04:13] <Jetstream_Senpai> Thanks, i found another archive of your DS9 streams :D If anyone else wants the link just DM me
[1:04:14] <+stinkomeanie> it was Childish Gambino so probably
[1:04:22] <+Lonewolf2840> i knew
[1:04:33] <S4boar> this some OC or a characters form a show/game?
[1:04:46] <+rawringkhris> I don't listen to much music past like 05
[1:04:50] <Curopium> I just listen to same song on repeat for a week so I keep pretty behind on todays hot tunes.
[1:05:04] <+stinkomeanie> missing out on a lot of good shit @rawringkhris
[1:05:05] <FakeKodex> 🌚
[1:05:31] <+rawringkhris> Oh I know I am, been catching up recently
[1:05:42] <+stinkomeanie> Never understood metal heads who refuse to listen to anything not metal
[1:06:07] <+stinkomeanie> I imagine their brains go "No beat, only metal"
[1:06:27] <Huntercd> Where are her clothes?
[1:06:37] <Frogwash> Under the fursuit
[1:06:49] <GarbageQueenEllie> More importantly, where are her ORGANS? :P
[1:06:54] <MKUltima> She's wearing jewelry what are you talking about
[1:06:56] <+stinkomeanie> under the mesh swimsuit lining
[1:07:03] <Curopium> If she had clothes they would probally be on the floor by now
[1:07:21] <CursedNobleman> why did i think he was gonna draw bigeu LUL
[1:07:22] <+Scevda> Mavis bacon
[1:07:26] <Huntercd> Her bracelets don't count
[1:07:42] <CursedNobleman> "i wonder what plague will draw today. Bigeu?" LUL
[1:07:50] <HelluvaNohbody> Fur makes clothing redundant
[1:07:51] <stfn893> Also that was the main squeeze cover earlier right
[1:08:00] <Treuan> Good thing she has necklaces and earrings then. Coulda been downright indecent
[1:08:20] <+stinkomeanie> she has arm bands and ear rings and 3 necklaces, how much more covered up does she need to be you prude
[1:09:15] <@Nightbot> Plague is a youtube animator and also streams at https://picarto.tv/Plague . Also: t-shirts! http://goo.gl/lze8QO
[1:09:26] <+stinkomeanie> Seventeen by Foreigner just remembered that one
[1:10:05] <+D4C_Trice> I see we have discovered Belladonna too
[1:10:05] <FennecZephyr> I honestly never do bledned coloring
[1:10:19] <FennecZephyr> Flats + cell shading usually looks fine for me
[1:10:26] <FennecZephyr> But I'm crap anyway
[1:10:27] <GarbageQueenEllie> Hell yeah Shakira!
[1:10:28] <Dave_booth> damn that track list is fire
[1:10:30] <CursedNobleman> i wonder how long it will take to get SFMs for her LUL
[1:10:41] <Huntercd> Hips
[1:10:42] <Daxalog> Where is this character from?
[1:10:50] <+D4C_Trice> @cursednobleman pretty sure they exist alreadu
[1:10:51] <+stinkomeanie> I miss brunette braided Shakira
[1:11:05] <+D4C_Trice> @daxalog trials of mana remake
[1:11:12] <Huntercd> Blonde is great on Shakira
[1:11:42] <%Samex_Comex> small and humble
[1:11:58] <GarbageQueenEllie> Shakira believes that flat is justice
[1:11:59] <+EyeFarted> I've never liked Shakira's weird warbly singing voice
[1:12:11] <+stinkomeanie> She sings like a beautiful goat
[1:12:12] <CursedNobleman> @D4C_Trice hmm... one moment. i will... have someone verify LUL
[1:12:21] <Curopium> @Daxalog I think this character is from new secret of mana game
[1:12:24] <Firemane1279> this song PogChamp
[1:12:24] <jsikandere> what does this strange animal want? goodness me, get the scattergun.
[1:12:34] <CursedNobleman> @Curopium the pixel version was hotter LUL
[1:12:37] <+stinkomeanie> just give her what she wants and play dead
[1:13:00] <jsikandere> remain limp and lifeless and she will leave?
[1:13:09] <+Scevda> Quick go stiff as a board.
[1:13:16] <+stinkomeanie> she'll....get what she wants then leave
[1:13:16] <%case01> God damn, remember this would play on music channels as a kid
[1:13:30] <CursedNobleman> she wants the mana LUL
[1:13:43] <GarbageQueenEllie> Poor lad doesn't realize she just wants the cat treats in his shirt pocket
[1:13:49] <%case01> Oh hell yeah
[1:13:54] <YakumoYomi> Yeah!
[1:13:59] <BigNerdSam> "Ma'am, could you not shred my Kanye shirt?"
[1:14:03] <+stinkomeanie> This is the part where Plague struggles with something at the beginning then finish at the end of the song
[1:14:22] <%Samex_Comex> "Megatron must be stopped, no matter the cost"
[1:14:23] <zecaptain_james> ^^
[1:14:25] <Firemane1279> Time fire music that FUCKS! PogChamp
[1:14:45] <+Scevda> Hey Ma-oh wait wrong stream
[1:14:54] <%case01> RIP Optimus
[1:15:26] <+stinkomeanie> Optimus Prime, the only one to beat Jesus' respawn score
[1:15:33] <+Heart0fInk> Man. I liked Unicron.
[1:16:02] <Fenlig> Ahh yes, I've entered the Plague zone
[1:16:06] <+Scevda> Is unicron a unicorn in beast wars?
[1:16:10] <CursedNobleman> is this what happens if you lose to this boss? LUL
[1:16:18] <+stinkomeanie> you get more butter
[1:16:20] <%case01> Crazy that Unicron was Orson Welles though
[1:16:32] <sadolerlaqreet1> Ma’am step away from the bulge now!!
[1:16:34] <jsikandere> what i gotta ask tho... is where her other nipples ? hardly furry at all ifn you ask me.
[1:16:39] <+stinkomeanie> but the butter comes from you
[1:17:02] <+SmortyPuffin> oh man please tell me chesney hawkes is coming up
[1:17:15] <Huntercd> Is this the montage?
[1:17:34] <+stinkomeanie> No this is the ending song after Plague saved the community center
[1:17:39] <SoFarFetched> oh boy this song
[1:17:55] <SoFarFetched> sipsipDab sipsipDab
[1:18:02] <+stinkomeanie> How would Plague save a community center anyway?
[1:18:21] <%EpicBigchill> I always remember the cartoon network commercials when I hear this song
[1:18:31] <%case01> He would give them the cattle they need to eat
[1:18:39] <sadolerlaqreet1> He’ll burn it down and use the insurance money to build a better one
[1:18:48] <+Heart0fInk> I remember this song from a Boomerang commercial break
[1:18:56] <Huntercd> yep
[1:19:26] <+stinkomeanie> Plague offered to draw a lewd of the CEO's OC to get him to change his mind

[1:20:07] <+stinkomeanie> That's 3 movies right there
[1:20:37] <+Mugen4552> been quite a while since I hurd this song.
[1:20:46] <+stinkomeanie> @NephiStreams I imagine someone drawing along like this was a Bob Ross episode
[1:21:35] <zecaptain_james> getting blasts from the past
[1:22:02] <NephiStreams> LUL @stinkomeanie
[1:25:24] <+MrPervSan> I swear I am not a furry
[1:25:25] <Jdrockefeller> I somehow figured I'd open this notification and see belladonna
[1:25:28] <+MrPervSan> But rooGasm
[1:26:04] <Jdrockefeller> just finished my first playthrough with Duran, Angela, and the gremlin
[1:26:05] <dildozerfred> RitzMitz
[1:26:06] <Vyskus> now we're going to use a little of phthalo blue to really make her pop
[1:26:18] <imquotin> woah haha it's a funny animal
[1:26:36] <Jdrockefeller> I enjoyed it, but I wish it had something harder than hard
[1:27:32] <CursedNobleman> i dunno, i struggle with snouts
[1:27:44] <CursedNobleman> monstergirls all day, but snouts are a hard no.
[1:27:51] <CursedNobleman> well, maybe sharkgirls.
[1:29:40] <+stinkomeanie> god i love peaches
[1:30:00] <%Samex_Comex> He needs that!
[1:30:11] <+stinkomeanie> Plague put the gun down
[1:31:02] <ZarodGaming> man i wish i didn't have to wake up early tmrw, love wjatching u work. don't care if it's gay
[1:31:22] <lchr0n0s> Where is this cat from? I have seen her a lot recently.
[1:31:27] <+stinkomeanie> dat gay dude @ZarodGaming
[1:31:36] <+stinkomeanie> work is gay dude @ZarodGaming
[1:31:44] <%Samex_Comex> This story is scary
[1:31:47] <Nimorp> fellas
[1:32:21] <+stinkomeanie> was that The Ugly Barnacle?
[1:32:25] <%KaiserMario> plagueGripes
[1:33:29] <+stinkomeanie> Snoop Dawg needs to be in more cartoons
[1:33:42] <YakumoYomi> Eli, did Woolie give you one of his N-word passes? I've heard he's been giving out counterfeits again, and we (of the Black Otaku Council) are concerned.
[1:34:26] <+stinkomeanie> plagueGripes
[1:35:24] <kingofnymphs> I agree
[1:35:25] <+stinkomeanie> someone forgot to tell that to Kendrick Lamar that sang on stage
[1:35:27] <CursedNobleman> 1st amendment rights have a strong priority in the SC. its very rare that its abridged
[1:35:29] <S4boar> maybey if you get N-Pass Premium form you local dealer
[1:35:39] <+stinkomeanie> Kendrick Lamar fan who sang*
[1:35:39] <+Heart0fInk> Music is not a free N word pass. but you can have it in your song.
[1:35:44] <Nimorp> yeah i was thinking of that Kendrick stage thing
[1:36:11] <+Scevda> Of just buy a N-Pass, sourced from Montreal.
[1:36:45] <BigNerdSam> I dunno man, there are some fake N-Passes floating around out there.
[1:36:46] <+Heart0fInk> Oh. Halo music
[1:36:47] <+stinkomeanie> Do I get them when I play Call of Duty?
[1:37:03] <Nimorp> thats a gamer pass, for the same thing tho
[1:37:09] <Jdrockefeller> I'd think you could replace the n word with brotha if you don't want to say it while doing a song.
[1:37:10] <BigNerdSam> You're better off getting N-Passes from the PUBG Bridge.
[1:37:14] <MrHappyFunshine> Noice, some Halo
[1:37:45] <BigNerdSam> It's more like the Nook Miles Ticket, each pass is worth one.
[1:37:55] <S4boar> it's an EXPERIENCE
[1:38:20] <+littleogre92> @Heart0fInk implying that there are tiers of N-word pass? I like it.
[1:38:44] <BigNerdSam> At the end of the Premium N-Pass, you get to switch races.
[1:39:09] <Nimorp> so all these people injecting tan are Alpha users?
[1:39:27] <BigNerdSam> Those people are using the cash shop.
[1:39:37] <+stinkomeanie> Woolie retweet on the subject https://twitter.com/CesarMariola/status/1257613318346465286/photo/1
[1:39:41] <%KaiserMario> No, that's the Premium N-Pass bonus, the U-face, like the one Justin Trudeau used during halloween
[1:40:42] <%KaiserMario> Just a reminder that Woolie's N-Passes are a scam, don't cash those in
[1:41:23] <WoolieVersus> 314 raiders from WoolieVersus have joined! 
[1:41:27] <YakumoYomi> Considering how often we (black people) use it, you'd think the knee-jerk reaction of being offended by the "N-word" would have died already. Those passes are becoming increasingly more valuable, instead.
[1:41:29] <jiggydoo> Yo
[1:41:30] <SilverRoddo> This is the music she ravages to?
[1:41:30] <+Jerimoi> yooo
[1:41:31] <Lord_maxios> what in

[1:44:36] <+Scevda> Its a compiliation!
[1:44:38] <+Dakuu75> When you start to associate a song with the streamer more than anything else. SeemsGood
[1:44:40] <WoolieVersus> Cool
[1:44:45] <grouchydata> give us the B E A N S
[1:44:50] <+stinkomeanie> does this character have toe beans like a cat? like canonically?
[1:44:52] <Vyskus> you flipped the canvas and I lost touch with reality for a second
[1:45:15] <andrei11dr> The furr covering the nips is not very anatomically correct, just saying
[1:45:18] <+nezyro_> just for a second? I was born out of touch with reality
[1:45:35] <%Samex_Comex> Always flip your canvas!

[1:47:03] <+stinkomeanie> Legend has it he kicked the black out of it when he kicked a demon to death
[1:47:10] <andrei11dr> He lost the blackness on his leg in the great Grenada war
[1:47:22] <+Scevda> ...Leg?
[1:47:24] <SilverRoddo> I feel Eli had some cool rings while tuning the radio dial.
[1:47:28] <YakumoYomi> It's simple: next time Woolie pops into your stream, just switch to some Sammy Davis Jr.
[1:47:33] <Nimorp> oh wollie fact i didn't know
[1:47:38] <Nimorp> woolie*
[1:47:51] <Karrrasu> SingsNote
[1:48:01] <+EyeFarted> @woolieversus 's white leg as kept him from getting arrested on several occasions.
[1:48:08] <GarbageQueenEllie> Woolie likes Big Band anyways, so you could always play that

[1:48:34] <andrei11dr> The first rap album i fully listened to was Me Against The World actually, that is a good way to get into rap music

[1:55:02] <@PatStaresAt> oh god what's he doijng now
[1:55:04] <+nezyro_> the correct question would be, why does this cat not have SIX MROE nipples
[1:55:09] <+stinkomeanie> ugh I remember Meet The Parents milking story
[1:55:10] <@PeachSaliva> This cat needs 6 tits Eli
[1:55:16] <%Samex_Comex> you have to find the 4 other ones, its like a game

[1:55:45] <Jack8274> 2 tits, but 6 nipples tucked away under the fur
[1:55:48] <andrei11dr> Nobody should have 6 tits
[1:55:51] <Jack8274> For a little sneaky suckle
[1:55:54] <Midos1717> @nezyro_ a man of culture i see, but i agree.
[1:55:56] <+kiwiredgrave> What type of cat is it based off, plague?
[1:55:58] <@PeachSaliva> 7 vaganas
[1:55:59] <Jdrockefeller> six tits is reserved for SMT satan
[1:56:00] <andrei11dr> Unless you Satan i guess

[1:56:12] <Treuan> Maybe more
[1:56:12] <grouchydata> I mean it's like fantasy tiddycat so maybe it has nineteen tits. Maybe those aren't tits, maybe they're guns. Or swords.
[1:56:13] <Vyskus> it's right legs right
[1:56:18] <+Cucamabungabu> @PeachSaliva are you also a big fan of bobs and vagenes?
[1:56:20] <+BubbaRands> I feel that 6 tits is too much. 3 or 4 is a nice medium ground
[1:56:20] <+Estuko> @PeachSaliva <:O
[1:56:21] <+Heart0fInk> 7 buttholes
[1:56:30] <@PeachSaliva> I AM 2 horses, Eli

[1:57:13] <GarbageQueenEllie> Two horses in a trenchcoat?
[1:57:14] <Vyskus> I mean two horses are better than one
[1:57:16] <+stinkomeanie> Oh the classic 2 horses in a trench coat working at the business factory bit
[1:57:23] <@PeachSaliva> Plague do u wanna hang out later
[1:57:27] <%Samex_Comex> dose pat know?
[1:57:37] <Jack8274> If you fuck a bird lady in the cloaca, what does that count as?
[1:57:40] <@PeachSaliva> We can watch videos about food
[1:57:42] <%KaiserMario> If Paige is two horses, then is Pat half a poney?

[1:59:58] <+Typhaeon> No, you were right
[1:59:59] <Vyskus> no, I am and idiot. it's ok
[2:00:00] <andrei11dr> I wonder if the Dark Souls Gods fap

[2:00:22] <%Samex_Comex> did one have "juicy" on their pants?
[2:00:23] <@Nightbot> @nezyro_ -> You have my attention. [stop spamming emotes] [warning]
[2:00:40] <grouchydata> I think so yes
[2:00:41] <+Typhaeon> Didn't the record label take the singer out and replace her with a model in the music video?
[2:00:47] <%caramello_man> Can you imagine plague dancing?
[2:00:56] <grouchydata> that sounds like a health issue yes
[2:00:57] <kingofnymphs> Is that even possible?
[2:00:58] <Quiet__Viking> hello @jeemukun
[2:00:58] <+nezyro_> yeah that sounds kdin of terrifying actually
[2:01:02] <+InsaneJackLondon> whas that smell?
[2:01:03] <@PeachSaliva> Plague is an incredible square dancer
[2:01:05] <@PeachSaliva> I’ve seen it
[2:01:08] <+InsaneJackLondon> IS BLUD
[2:01:08] <Jeemukun> sweating blood sounds unpleasent
[2:01:11] <@PeachSaliva> Absolutely mesmerizibg
[2:01:11] <grouchydata> Hemtidrosis
[2:01:12] <+BubbaRands> especially in this time of year...
[2:01:13] <grouchydata> it's a thing
[2:01:14] <SilverRoddo> I need Rammstein to cover this song.
[2:01:17] <grouchydata> *hema
[2:01:17] <Vyskus> sweating blood would be a terrifying prospect
[2:01:19] <Major_monotone> I’m pretty sure there are many venoms that do that
[2:01:24] <OminousBagel> Wasn't that an episode of Dragonball GT and in Hocus Pocus
[2:01:29] <+Typhaeon> Swing, too
[2:01:37] <andrei11dr> No i want born
[2:01:37] <Jeemukun> the 90's was a weird time
[2:01:41] <Major_monotone> Also hello Plague and chat! How are we doing today?
[2:01:44] <Vyskus> if you go to a party with white people it still is a thing
[2:01:47] <+stinkomeanie> plague carries cardboard and dance gloves eerywhere
[2:01:51] <@PeachSaliva> Line dancing is still a thing in some areas. It makes me wish for death.
[2:01:52] <grouchydata> How about The Band
[2:01:56] <%EpicBigchill> AGAIN!?
[2:01:56] <+littleogre92> When Cotton Eye Joe was in every dance party ever
[2:01:57] <grouchydata> lil Levon Helm
[2:02:02] <@Nightbot> @gsoto83 -> Sometimes I even amaze myself. [stop spamming symbols] [warning]

[2:02:24] <%Samex_Comex> slide to the left, slide to the right, everybody clap your hands
[2:02:27] <Vyskus> I think there used to be one on Spotify but it got removed
[2:02:28] <Quiet__Viking> YE! This is my JAM
[2:02:37] <+Cucamabungabu> Why is music better than sex
[2:02:38] <+BubbaRands> Bloody Stream? it's on spotify now
[2:02:40] <GoopyEuclid> I’ve only ever found the long version of BLOODY STREAM on Spotify.
[2:02:42] <Jeemukun> bloody storm? shouldn't be too hard to find i imagine
[2:02:43] <+dybia> I think Billy Ray Cyrus and some other country stars got super popular in the 90s, line dancing might have been tied to that for a bit
[2:02:47] <Wanky_Woop> Best OP tho
[2:02:48] <YakumoYomi> Yami wa...!
[2:02:50] <andrei11dr> Im kinda sad that the early intros just got one version

[2:03:17] <YakumoYomi> You don't have a choice.
[2:03:23] <SilverRoddo> Would anyone want to get their fingers stuck in her hair? I feel i would want that.
[2:03:29] <%KaiserMario> When is Plague playing Dark Souls again?
[2:03:37] <+BubbaRands> Hojo's Average Tuesday Kappa
[2:03:37] <Vyskus> I love how much I hate hojo, I want to strangle him

[2:03:38] <gsoto83> I can only see Woolie
[2:03:44] <oneyeseesin3d> more like Hojo's Distubing Experiment
[2:03:45] <CalderGaming> the biggest turn-off jojo OP at the time of airing
[2:03:50] <+Cucamabungabu> @KaiserMario waking up in the morning ad feeling like shit is you still playing dark souls technically.

[2:04:45] <+thishere2103> is this the Taiga version?
[2:04:48] <@Nightbot> @Midos1717 -> Sometimes you scare me! [stop spamming emotes] [warning]
[2:04:51] <Jeemukun> @gsoto83 shame, i think it's underated
[2:04:54] <%KaiserMario> I really don't like Koichi
[2:04:55] <YakumoYomi> @gsoto83 Same. It seems to be the least popular Part 4 opening theme
[2:05:01] <CalderGaming> just joined; what's the context for this art?
[2:05:18] <andrei11dr> Furries
[2:05:22] <oneyeseesin3d> lol
[2:05:23] <CalderGaming> works for me
[2:05:25] <CursedNobleman> trials of mana LUL

[2:05:33] <Jeemukun> honestly I don't think there's been a bad jojo opening
[2:05:33] <SilverRoddo> 3 emotes is the limit, i believe.
[2:05:37] <gsoto83> @Jeemukun @YakumoYomi Some times others are not blessed with taste such as ours lol

[2:06:56] <Jeemukun> If I knew how to style it i probably have enough hair to have one
[2:06:58] <%KaiserMario> Will you be drawing a cub dangling suckling on her teat?
[2:06:59] <Nimorp> oh
[2:07:04] <oneyeseesin3d> Was it accidental?
[2:07:05] <SilverRoddo> Conan O’Brien?
[2:07:10] <restingbones> True pompadours don't exist. they are an anime fantasy
[2:07:10] <Quiet__Viking> That's a awesome kid
[2:07:15] <%Samex_Comex> The hair gives him magic powers
[2:07:16] <EatTheB0otyLikeGroceries> but why does it have tits
[2:07:20] <GarbageQueenEllie> yuck
[2:07:20] <CalderGaming> i feel like I've seen an anime character with that haircut
[2:07:25] <Curopium> That kids going places
[2:07:25] <cellularmishap> an unkemp afro?
[2:07:28] <%case01> One of those shitty ones that become popular here in the GB
[2:07:28] <GoopyEuclid> Oh footballer hair but done bad.

[2:07:32] <+Scevda> Its returning!
[2:07:33] <andrei11dr> That just soundswrong
[2:07:34] <+Typhaeon> The world needs more weird
[2:07:38] <Jeemukun> I feel like proper pompedours nowadays are only possible if you've got japanese hair
[2:07:41] <Nimorp> oh, you, quiet viking. love your stuff
[2:07:41] <cap_bon> Just finished FF7R is "Who?" a normal reaction to zack if you didnt play the original.
[2:07:44] <%case01> Oh hell ye
[2:07:45] <+stinkomeanie> i likr this song
[2:07:45] <GoopyEuclid> I used to see that sort of hair all the time while substituting.
[2:07:47] <gsoto83> oh no, the blue grass pickin' series.
[2:07:51] <Vyskus> yes cap
[2:07:59] <@PeachSaliva> Ah the music of your people

[2:08:20] <ForlornHunter> rooKek
[2:08:20] <%KaiserMario> Says the banjo woman
[2:08:29] <%case01> Blue grass is always good nevermind what song it is somehow
[2:08:30] <ThePhantomOne> aww it's float on
[2:08:34] <whittacre> @PlagueOfGripes Have you listened to Steve n, Seagulls?
[2:08:37] <cap_bon> oh good I thought I had missed some vital cutscene or some vital cutscene
[2:08:39] <whittacre> bluegrass metal covers
[2:08:44] <CalderGaming> when's zydeco
[2:08:49] <restingbones> This isn't modest mouse
[2:08:55] <aluddss> I remember when I heard about this song cuz of the lupe fiasco fiasco
[2:08:56] <ThePhantomOne> yup
[2:08:56] <@Nightbot> Plague is a youtube animator and also streams at https://picarto.tv/Plague . Also: t-shirts! http://goo.gl/lze8QO
[2:09:02] <YakumoYomi> As a North Carolinian, I don't mind blue grass.
[2:09:05] <gsoto83> @PeachSaliva can agree, sometimes the poison is very tasty @PlagueOfGripes
[2:09:07] <EatTheB0otyLikeGroceries> i think it's that I can't at all relate to people who feel a will to create this kind of music
[2:09:09] <oneyeseesin3d> schadenfreude
[2:09:14] <SilverRoddo> I heard a bluegrass cover of a HIM song, pretty good.
[2:09:16] <+Typhaeon> Being self-conscious about your music is so adolescent
[2:09:20] <Vyskus> I am also from the Kentucky, so this is part for the course
[2:09:22] <+stinkomeanie> did a black guy walk into the stream?
[2:09:24] <%LordSDB> Heh, took late Plague, my grandma showed me all music as a kid. I enjoy this
[2:09:27] <restingbones> The heck is blue grass? is it a band? a genre? a drug?
[2:09:37] <EatTheB0otyLikeGroceries> a drug
[2:09:42] <+Heart0fInk> We'll all float on down here..
[2:09:50] <@PeachSaliva> Bluegrass is the most potent of weeds
[2:09:56] <gsoto83> @restingbones 2 out of 3 of those are correct, guess which
[2:10:00] <restingbones> @PeachSaliva gimme
[2:10:05] <YakumoYomi> "What's that there? A violin? In blue grass, we call that a fiddle."
[2:10:11] <Vyskus> yeah you could say Kentucky is covered in it
[2:10:11] <+stinkomeanie> ooh weed dont mind if i do
[2:10:12] <%case01> This is always a beautiful song whichever genre it is it seems
[2:10:15] <andrei11dr> @peachsaliva I think that would be California weed
[2:10:18] <%thedamnchaos1> !uptime
[2:10:18] <Midos1717> I try blue grass if it was a thing, sounds like an alternative to red cocaine.
[2:10:18] <@Nightbot> 2 hours 10 minutes 27 seconds
[2:10:24] <gsoto83> Well yeah, I think we all like good music lol
[2:10:25] <oneyeseesin3d> You mix blue grass with red and green to get gold pot :P
[2:10:25] <restingbones> @gsoto83 1 and 3
[2:10:26] <+LastHazzerd> I like the "O'Brother Where Art Thou" soundtrack.
[2:10:36] <+azure22900> this is nice to listen to.
[2:10:49] <CursedNobleman> play the banjo song from deliverance LUL
[2:10:50] <+stinkomeanie> blueglass is the best chase music
[2:10:53] <%case01> Townes Van Zandt?!
[2:10:54] <%LordSDB> what the name of this song?
[2:10:59] <+stinkomeanie> play Winter Hymn after please
[2:11:01] <ArashlTempesta> SeemsGood
[2:11:08] <EatTheB0otyLikeGroceries> nobody answered my question
[2:11:10] <CalderGaming> blue grass cures poison and gives you temporary damage resistance
[2:11:13] <EatTheB0otyLikeGroceries> why does the animal have tits
[2:11:20] <%case01> Oh hell yesl, love delta blues
[2:11:21] <Vyskus> why not
[2:11:24] <oneyeseesin3d> cause it's a lady animal
[2:11:28] <gsoto83> Doesn't Iron Horse do most of the blue grass pickin' songs?
[2:11:32] <YakumoYomi> @CursedNobleman Only if he puts up a picture of Ned Beatty's man boobs.
[2:11:33] <+BubbaRands> @CursedNobleman dueling banjos is legit fyre. fite me

[2:12:17] <%KaiserMario> @PlagueOfGripes Have you ever tried "mate" , a.k.a. "chimarrao"?
[2:12:18] <gsoto83> Shes jones in for the D.... S9
[2:12:24] <+Typhaeon> I wish I had a friend to talk to me the way Plague talks to Peach
[2:12:24] <restingbones> Paige is here for the furry softcore
[2:12:24] <@PeachSaliva> I’m here because I love u and support uuuu
[2:12:27] <@PatStaresAt> hey be nice to my woman she is cooking
[2:12:29] <CalderGaming> WHAT odo dick
[2:12:29] <grouchydata> Everyone wants either Jadzia, Odo, or Sisko, or some combo
[2:12:30] <OminousBagel> Odo dick. It's a fakeeee
[2:12:33] <+BubbaRands> "DS9 dick" is a new term i've added to my dictionary
[2:12:33] <EatTheB0otyLikeGroceries> i prefer deep space 69
[2:12:33] <grouchydata> Or Worf
[2:12:35] <@PatStaresAt> if you distract her she will fall into the pot
[2:12:37] <grouchydata> but EVERYONE wants Worf
[2:12:38] <kokujin_> GOOD SONG
[2:12:41] <+cappyd33> wow pat you're making her cook
[2:12:43] <+stinkomeanie> yooo that Little Mermaid comic you tweeted made me spit out my drink @PeachSaliva
[2:12:45] <@PeachSaliva> Please Eli I need Odo penuss
[2:12:51] <Jeemukun> could odo have more than one dick if he wanted?
[2:12:57] <@PeachSaliva> I have two hands!
[2:12:57] <grouchydata> aw ye
[2:12:58] <@PatStaresAt> I dont make anybody cook I just start whining about being hungry and slapping my tummy until food occurs
[2:13:01] <+Heart0fInk> Slime penis is best penis
[2:13:03] <gsoto83> oh no, not the Odo pep-us
[2:13:03] <CalderGaming> i should be cooking too, fuck. stupid sun, tricking my internal clock
[2:13:06] <restingbones> What are you havin?
[2:13:07] <marlowe86> Plague, do you like any of the music from the Bleach anime?
[2:13:07] <+Scevda> Tbf, I brought it up first. But srsly they are fun.
[2:13:15] <@PeachSaliva> I am making grits!!
[2:13:16] <bevyrage> they just merge when they both become a liquid right
[2:13:17] <+EyeFarted> @PatStaresAt The fucks she have, a cauldren?
[2:13:21] <grouchydata> cheesy?
[2:13:24] <Jeemukun> would it be similar to fucking a slime girl is the real question
[2:13:36] <YakumoYomi> I had grits this morning.
[2:13:39] <%case01> Seems Like Picard jacks off to delta blues every night #
[2:13:39] <bevyrage> a slime girl with solid mass probably
[2:13:41] <grouchydata> Depends on if Odo wanted it to be I guess
[2:13:42] <restingbones> This is the first time Ive heard of "grits"
[2:13:45] <grouchydata> like he can be solid
[2:13:48] <weissguard> I didn't realize Odo was in The Patriot.
[2:13:53] <Vyskus> what happens if a changling gets preggers and then changes their genetalia 🤔
[2:13:56] <%KaiserMario> Grits? Shouldn't that be done already? Takes like 20 min...
[2:13:56] <bevyrage> ... or like a newtonian fluid maybe?
[2:13:57] <andrei11dr> I wonder which animal has the most horrible sex
[2:14:03] <Huntercd> Is it like how amoeba reproduce?
[2:14:04] <SilverRoddo> bitterBeat
[2:14:04] <Jeemukun> man i haven't watched really any star trek since the oughts, i think the only one i've seen all the way through is voyager
[2:14:08] <gsoto83> I had Japanese Katsu chicken curry, thats like grits (no its not)
[2:14:18] <Jeemukun> spieces 8472 is still cool to me at least
[2:14:25] <+Typhaeon> Dude, a good chicken katsu curry is the best food on the planet
[2:14:27] <restingbones> Boiled Cornmeal?
[2:14:32] <+BubbaRands> damn now i want some grits...
[2:14:45] <restingbones> That sounds... just about acceptable as a substitute for real food
[2:14:50] <+BubbaRands> Yo sugar or salt with grits?
[2:14:52] <YakumoYomi> Alright...this song is making me feel some things.
[2:15:02] <+stinkomeanie> My grits take 30-40 minutes
[2:15:05] <marlowe86> Plague, have you heard of the band Blue October?
[2:15:41] <gsoto83> @Typhaeon We use to have a curry house down the street from us, could walk there for some tasty-ness, then i closed mid-January
[2:15:59] <+Typhaeon> I gotta drive to Bawston for a decent curry, and that ain't exactly an option nowadays
[2:16:05] <Vyskus> how do those bracelets stay so far up her arms
[2:16:19] <Vyskus> oh hell yeah this fight is dope
[2:16:22] <+cappyd33> Tsukioyomi
[2:16:28] <CalderGaming> I'm IN Boston and I can't go out for curry either lol
[2:16:29] <+Typhaeon> Suddenly, FFXIV
[2:16:37] <Jeemukun> my town is kinda starved for good ethnic foods i feel
[2:16:38] <restingbones> Why is it called "grits"? it sounds mushy at worst and spongy at best.
[2:16:47] <Jeemukun> least if you don't live downtown anyways
[2:17:16] <YakumoYomi> @restingbones Nah...grits at its worst is either "soupy" or "wet sand".
[2:17:24] <+BubbaRands> @restingbones because of the "gritty" texture it has?
[2:17:47] <+stinkomeanie> even shrimp and grits?
[2:17:51] <+EyeFarted> TAKE THAT BACK
[2:17:54] <+Typhaeon> They're good with maple syrup, but that's because you're eating maple syrup
[2:17:56] <@PeachSaliva> You’re a wheat germ
[2:18:02] <@PeachSaliva> :(
[2:18:02] <Them00n> What about cheese grits?
[2:18:04] <KnivesEve> whos this fine furry from?
[2:18:08] <CalderGaming> I do have S&B curry powder which is the archetypical japanese curry flavor, so maybe I should get stew ingredients and make it myself again...
[2:18:09] <%LordSDB> Oatmeal is where it's at
[2:18:09] <+BubbaRands> That sounds like oatmeal lover talk
[2:18:10] <grouchydata> cheesy grits are beautiful
[2:18:13] <Vyskus> hot takes in plague stream today
[2:18:17] <Jeemukun> corn is at it's best when on the cob
[2:18:17] <CalderGaming> I thoughts grits were corn-based?
[2:18:20] <YakumoYomi> I don't like sweet grits. Cheese and salt is how I do it.
[2:18:22] <+absolute_weapon> Wow, such harsh words on perfectly fine grits
[2:18:23] <grouchydata> filthy scots and their Oats!
[2:18:27] <grouchydata> kidding ilu Scotland
[2:18:39] <+stinkomeanie> Oatmeal and honey
[2:18:42] <grouchydata> and oatmeal is respectable
[2:18:44] <restingbones> @BubbaRands I guess so, I thought Gritty meant like tough or rough. But I just looked it up and it doesn't.
[2:18:47] <@PeachSaliva> Ew oatmeal is terrible with fruit
[2:18:50] <Jeemukun> my mum made chocolate chip-oatmeal cookies recently, they good
[2:18:51] <@PeachSaliva> Unless it’s bananas
[2:18:56] <GoopyEuclid> Oatmeal texture makes me wanna wretch. :(
[2:18:59] <restingbones> learn new things about english language every day
[2:18:59] <Huntercd> berries
[2:19:14] <+Heart0fInk> Oatmeal is only good in cookie form
[2:19:18] <+Estuko> I like Oatmeal cookies
[2:19:19] <CalderGaming> apples and pears, berries, bananas... all good
[2:19:23] <Jeemukun> apple cinnamon oatmeal is goty
[2:19:30] <+Typhaeon> You can do it, Twitch
[2:19:38] <%LordSDB> Sounds like a bunch of people here don't know how to cook oatmeal right
[2:19:39] <+stinkomeanie> Oatmeal with roasted pecans and syrup
[2:19:39] <Vyskus> by the time I'm done adding sugar to oatmeal it is no longer food, it is candy, so I don't eat oatmeal
[2:19:42] <+Estuko> Reminds me of Banana Pancakes, I remember ordering it from a restaurant and that was depressing...
[2:19:45] <Jeemukun> apple cinnamon anything is amazing come to think of it
[2:19:46] <+BubbaRands> Oatmeal with maple and brown sugar? *Chef's Kiss*
[2:19:49] <grouchydata> oatmeal is in the "get comfy poops" food category, and it fulfills that function beautifully
[2:19:59] <grouchydata> but ees better with stuff in it yes
[2:20:06] <Nimorp> I live in Scotland and the idea of grits sounds like something a Scottish person would have invented in US
[2:20:12] <grouchydata> they probably did
[2:20:16] <CursedNobleman> hmm, i wonder if you can fry oatmeal
[2:20:19] <grouchydata> because corn grew and oats didn't yet
[2:20:26] <Huntercd> Did Pat get the pass?
[2:20:27] <grouchydata> oatcakes
[2:20:33] <grouchydata> yeah, can fry it 100%
[2:20:42] <YakumoYomi> I've never played FFXIV, but this is a stellar track.
[2:20:59] <Vyskus> ffxiv boss fights have incredible music
[2:21:03] <+Typhaeon> Lot of great music in 14
[2:21:17] <+BubbaRands> I just Wiki'd Grits and apparently it's of Native American origin...the more you know...
[2:21:23] <+Spiggerus> I want belladona to mating press me
[2:21:36] <%KaiserMario> @Huntercd Pat is saving his pass to get more mileage when he cashes it in
[2:22:01] <Huntercd> Make sense
[2:22:03] <restingbones> I love oatmeal. I like to put a little butter in the middle.
[2:22:05] <kingofnymphs> What is amazon pressing?
[2:22:10] <+Spiggerus> doesnt matter, i want it
[2:22:12] <DeltascapeV4> ^ THE best
[2:22:26] <%KaiserMario> CONAN
[2:22:28] <grouchydata> conan yas
[2:22:28] <CursedNobleman> LUL
[2:22:34] <Jeemukun> oh god plague WHY
[2:22:34] <grouchydata> CROM!
[2:22:41] <Vyskus> asking the real questions tonight
[2:22:42] <DeltascapeV4> D:
[2:22:44] <+Engwithan_Elder_God> One of the best soundtracks.
[2:22:44] <+BubbaRands> @kingofnymphs ..think mating press but dude on bottom...
[2:22:57] <+EyeFarted> Don't you have to be over 5'10" to press either way?
[2:22:59] <@PeachSaliva> Amazon press?
[2:23:06] <gsoto83> Knew it
[2:23:12] <@PeachSaliva> What is that
[2:23:23] <Vyskus> it's where you ship pat using your two day free shipping
[2:23:24] <%KaiserMario> Plague, did you ever see the Amazon from Dragon's Crown?
[2:23:27] <Jeemukun> probably shouldn't google that
[2:23:37] <YakumoYomi> Having a woman mount you is what is best in life.
[2:23:51] <+stinkomeanie> I googled it, it was what I imagined
[2:23:52] <%Samex_Comex> Amazon DDT
[2:23:54] <+stinkomeanie> to the T
[2:23:59] <%Samex_Comex> Off the ropes
[2:24:05] <+Typhaeon> Yep
[2:24:06] <Jeemukun> pat and paige are more than happy to joke about their sex life on their own streams
[2:24:06] <@PeachSaliva> Oh what the hell
[2:24:07] <Sabbrewolf> yes
[2:24:07] <@PeachSaliva> Gross
[2:24:08] <%LordSDB> Yeah
[2:24:08] <CalderGaming> how is that different from cowgirl
[2:24:09] <kingra> Yes
[2:24:09] <%KaiserMario> Yes
[2:24:11] <+Scevda> Amazing that this song plays when the convo takes this route.
[2:24:15] <YakumoYomi> That's the one. Kamitani's work to a T.
[2:24:27] <Nimorp> "stylised"
[2:24:30] <gsoto83> Either the fattest of tittes of thicc-iest of thighs
[2:24:30] <Them00n> Is Amazon press different from mating press?
[2:24:37] <HazHap> me on the bottm
[2:24:37] <Karrrasu> Squid3 Squid1 Squid4
[2:24:39] <%caramello_man> Conan(Arnie) is all abut the SEX
[2:24:49] <+EyeFarted> Paige wishes she could make Pat's ankles touch his ears
[2:25:09] <+Scevda> Yes, and one elf with moderately sized thighs.
[2:25:17] <+BubbaRands> I wonder if Conan ever got amazon'd...
[2:25:32] <CalderGaming> oh ok never mind
[2:25:48] <gsoto83> @CalderGaming Some times when a man loves a woman, but the woman REALLY wants control and the man is willing to relinquish it...
[2:26:14] <CalderGaming> lol I got it cleared up thanks
[2:26:26] <CalderGaming> it's just the name that I hadn't heard before
[2:26:31] <Huntercd> I imagine Pat as one of those tiny horses
[2:26:48] <CalderGaming> ^shetland ponies?
[2:26:58] <Huntercd> Those dudes yea
[2:27:15] <CalderGaming> they're amazing
[2:27:30] <%KaiserMario> "shitland" ponies = Pat
[2:27:45] <YakumoYomi> @Scevda I find that Kamitani's better designs are the ones where they aren't ridiculously proportioned for max sex appeal. Momohime, Elf, Velvet, etc. (even though I love me some Raijin).
[2:27:53] <Jeemukun> human methods od animal breeding come in two forms i find: "what if we made it really big" and "what if we made it really small"
[2:27:55] <gsoto83> One of my neighbors has those as a support animal. I love seeing the guy when I'm out for my quick laps
[2:28:35] <Leonhiro> !playlist
[2:28:42] <Leonhiro> !song
[2:28:42] <+Scevda> I can totally get that. The lack of restraints on those means those with constraints to their design appear all the better.
[2:28:57] <Leonhiro> :S this is conan the barbarians soundtrack right?
[2:29:25] <%Samex_Comex> HA have a list being made!
[2:29:29] <Leonhiro> just wondering the songs name
[2:29:31] <Leonhiro> Ty
[2:29:39] <just_furu> ssup
[2:29:50] <just_furu> is this not bannable on twitch??
[2:30:02] <restingbones> oh its that song
[2:30:06] <Nimorp> man, this song sounds like childhood to me. good ol vhs tapes of conan
[2:30:19] <+SaltySombrero> SourPls
[2:30:30] <Ipsenscastle> is that ... femme Talbain?
[2:30:53] <+stinkomeanie> tea is ready!
[2:30:55] <Cal_ixo> no cause fur
[2:30:56] <CursedNobleman> trials of mana belladona
[2:31:03] <Ipsenscastle> ohh
[2:31:26] <+stinkomeanie> what song is this?
[2:31:37] <KnivesEve> is she a boss character or party member?
[2:31:57] <%KaiserMario> I heard Plague had opinions on stuff
[2:32:08] <Cal_ixo> she might as well be covered head to toe in yoga pants (AKA bodysuit)
[2:32:36] <+BubbaRands> How come every Japanese 80-90's city life song sounds like I've heard it when i was 8?
[2:33:20] <+stinkomeanie> Japanese have a real good sense for funk and R&B
[2:33:32] <Jeemukun> reminds me I found a really good japanese surf rock artist recently
[2:33:51] <smallheals> hey plague love your work on a unrelated note do you have an idea for a spaceship design ?
[2:33:56] <CursedNobleman> @KnivesEve lategame boss, shes the dragon of the game
[2:34:12] <+BubbaRands> I actually like it
[2:34:13] <grouchydata> But batman says
[2:34:13] <Handsome0ne> Wow that exists??
[2:34:13] <Sabbrewolf> Yeah.. this sounds pretty dope. what is the track called?
[2:34:15] <grouchydata> Cowabunga
[2:34:15] <gsoto83> Yeah, I wish i could go back and see what the music scene is like. When I lived back there 5 years ago it was a lot of Jamacian Two Tone in the Hokido island
[2:34:20] <+Heart0fInk> It sure is
[2:34:21] <+stinkomeanie> Japanese were huge fans of jazz and R&B which also transition into Japanese Electric club music
[2:34:25] <Karrrasu> it was pretty cool when he fought the shredder
[2:34:28] <Sabbrewolf> The comic version of that was a lot better
[2:34:29] <%Samex_Comex> Batman eats pizza!
[2:34:35] <+BubbaRands> I was stupid, therefor I liked it
[2:34:36] <Karrrasu> saw it like a month ago
[2:34:37] <+Heart0fInk> you mean the mutant models? yeah. they suck
[2:34:44] <KnivesEve> ah okay
[2:34:46] <majindusto> Shredder vs Batman is Awesome tho
[2:34:53] <Karrrasu> yes
[2:35:20] <DehiDehi> plague sounds different
[2:36:09] <+stinkomeanie> Oh shit i i didn't know DJ Quik worked with Tupac
[2:37:06] <+SaltySombrero> damn can i get a link to this? 's Kinda fuego
[2:37:45] <+stinkomeanie> It's Late Night by 2pac
[2:37:47] <+datmegamandeeeee> Me: “oh! Plague is streaming!” (See’s furry art) “Yeah, that’s right”
[2:37:53] <%KaiserMario> Is Elon Musk child name abuse of a minor?
[2:38:01] <DehiDehi> this is odd bluegras moosic
[2:38:27] <KnivesEve> @KaiserMario id say so
[2:38:42] <%KaiserMario> fair
[2:38:48] <+SaltySombrero> @stinkomeanie good lookin' out
[2:39:20] <grouchydata> where's the banjo tunes
[2:39:34] <grouchydata> oh hell yes
[2:40:57] <+BubbaRands> I like these banjo tunes
[2:42:36] <+datmegamandeeeee> Out of curiosity, plague, have you played trials of mana? If so, do you like it?
[2:42:47] <thehurart> I like this
[2:43:30] <restingbones> what did you model the pants bulge after?
[2:44:10] <+Spiggerus> smol dick confirmed
[2:44:24] <%Samex_Comex> They are not used to it being large
[2:44:24] <+BubbaRands> there's abulge?
[2:45:06] <%KaiserMario> I miss your in-depth video reviews/analysis of dumb anime stuff...
[2:45:12] <+wicketpelican> I had no idea Plague liked rap and hip hop. Literally absolutely one hundred percent no idea
[2:46:05] <+stinkomeanie> hip hop is pretty popular, but that's just my humble opinion PixelBob
[2:46:17] <+jorgamund> Plague letting his inner angry black man flow
[2:46:30] <+SlyKnuxRealist4> Looks like I stumbled upon a Sexually Aggressive Animal part 2 : Electric Bootyloo
[2:46:37] <+wicketpelican> It is, but I didn't take him as someone who listens to that. Knowing he comes from farmland and the kind of content he produces. Of course it's ignorant of me assuming this.
[2:46:38] <grouchydata> you did
[2:47:06] <+taku_toots> I thought I knew what I was getting into when I clicked the link but hawt dang
[2:47:21] <conchubar11> I come from a similar area Plague lives in, and my dad introduced me to 80 and 90's hip hop
[2:47:25] <%KaiserMario> Gohan's video is like a month old already! Gimme some moar! Like how trash is Onepunch-man season 2
[2:47:25] <+wicketpelican> I miss plague on the podcast too, dude is just awesome to listen to
[2:47:44] <conchubar11> Course he also showed me all of the Southern and Old School Hard Rock as well so
[2:47:45] <+wicketpelican> That Gohan video was the shit for real
[2:47:49] <+BubbaRands> @wicketpelican What? furry shit can't be down with the struggle?!
[2:48:04] <+wicketpelican> @BubbaRands hahahahahahahahahahahhahaha
[2:48:09] <%Samex_Comex> money and butts
[2:48:32] <+wicketpelican> Also, music a lot lowder than his voice, I'm not a native english speaker and it's hard to understand him
[2:48:36] <+wicketpelican> Louder*
[2:48:44] <@Nightbot> Plague is a youtube animator and also streams at https://picarto.tv/Plague . Also: t-shirts! http://goo.gl/lze8QO
[2:48:45] <conchubar11> Any normal white guy ever listening to rap: Marge MEME "I just think it's neat"
[2:48:52] <+stinkomeanie> You know between the ending hip hop music in some of his videos and Dark Holes parody it shouldnt be that surprising
[2:48:59] <YakumoYomi> I like to think there's an angry black man inside us all (even me, a pretty apathetic black man).
[2:49:18] <%LordSDB> Two-poc did greatly influenced philosophical rapping, and Big ended up more influencing more of the stylish form of rapping and bars.
[2:49:32] <+BubbaRands> THUG MANSION!
[2:49:48] <+wicketpelican> I'm brazillian and I totally have africans as part of my DNA hahaha, I'm a white fellow with a natural blackpower
[2:50:03] <+BubbaRands> It never fails to bring a tear to my eye...
[2:50:11] <+wicketpelican> My cousins vary from really black to german white
[2:50:13] <+jorgamund> I bought an N pass from Woolie, I'm allowed to rap now
[2:50:14] <@PeachSaliva> Eli
[2:50:25] <ChortlesJ1> Wow that Mario Kart TBF video was FOREVER ago
[2:50:27] <CalderGaming> there was a line from Quartet (2012) where an old white guy tries to figure out how to relate rap to what he knows: "when a character in an opera is stabbed, he sings about it. when a rapper is stabbed, he talks."
[2:50:27] <@PeachSaliva> Eli whatcha doing
[2:50:36] <conchubar11> Oh shit the queen pineapple is here
[2:50:46] <critfumble_> what a fantastic vibe for a plague stream
[2:50:49] <conchubar11> next DS9 strem when?
[2:50:54] <+EyeFarted> He's baking a cake, Paige...
[2:50:57] <+stinkomeanie> 23&Me Plague results came in, it turns out he is 80% Samoan with a pigmentation issue
[2:50:59] <+wicketpelican> Peach is awesome too
[2:51:01] <critfumble_> oh snap it's tall dark and mustard
[2:51:19] <YakumoYomi> Peach is one of the Wild Samoans, confirmed.
[2:51:27] <+taku_toots> this quite the sweet song
[2:52:51] <jacewolf_is_the_best> whoa
[2:52:54] <Nimorp> uu i like the shadow
[2:52:56] <jacewolf_is_the_best> momma
[2:53:12] <+BubbaRands> Great now I'm crying into my Margarita. Thanks Plague
[2:53:15] <CalderGaming> my first exposure to tupac was a newgrounds cartoon about how he got killed by biggie for stealing his cheetos. I find that extremely unfortunate. fuck 90's suburbia
[2:53:20] <ThisGamingDragon> Hi Plague
[2:53:28] <conchubar11> Woot discovery
[2:53:41] <critfumble_> banger

[2:54:24] <critfumble_> radio DJ plague
[2:54:29] <ThisGamingDragon> is this an OC? or who is this?
[2:54:31] <critfumble_> imagine
[2:54:33] <+stinkomeanie> Daft Punk had a longer cameo appearance in Interstella 5555 than the half second they had in Tron
[2:54:38] <%KaiserMario> Plague, did you ever consider partnering up with someone for creating arts and crafts and such?
[2:54:40] <+Scevda> One of my favorite selections you play Eli.
[2:54:43] <critfumble_> drive time with Eli
[2:54:48] <+Lonewolf2840> just noticed her belly
[2:55:12] <+BubbaRands> @Lonewolf2840 a little fupa
[2:55:39] <critfumble_> fupa is justice
[2:55:48] <conchubar11> I think she wants more than a fupa
[2:55:52] <+Lonewolf2840> @BubbaRands not her first rodeo
[2:56:08] <ThisGamingDragon> that vag tuft tho
[2:56:22] <+stinkomeanie> this picture needs 100% more lens flair
[2:56:34] <ThisGamingDragon> Matt does need to be shaved
[2:56:46] <conchubar11> Lol is he an idiot for getting in this situation or just in general?
[2:56:54] <%Samex_Comex> What should the idiot's name be?
[2:57:07] <oneyeseesin3d> "I guess I should shave the idiot" I say to myself whenever I see myself in the mirrior.
[2:57:08] <+Lonewolf2840> putting a old VHS filer will send the message
[2:57:10] <@PeachSaliva> Eli why does the man have an erection
[2:57:13] <@PeachSaliva> He got a boner
[2:57:21] <+stinkomeanie> he should be called Jon Arbuckle
[2:57:22] <RaenDragon> lmao
[2:57:27] <$RC_S3kshun8> Codpiece Paige
[2:57:31] <%LordSDB> Thats not a boner
[2:57:37] <Curopium> Thats were he hides his candy from the furry
[2:57:39] <kingra> He MUST be hard
[2:57:39] <@PeachSaliva> That is a chub
[2:57:40] <%Samex_Comex> Anon has a huge dick
[2:57:43] <CalderGaming> does chat need the lecture about growers and showers
[2:57:44] <VroomSoon> I'm projecting :)
[2:57:45] <trianglehat> still hot
[2:57:45] <+JailShmixRemix> "Ordinary" Murder
[2:57:46] <+Heart0fInk> Fear Boners Are Real!!
[2:57:48] <bevyrage> not everyone needs a fear boner when they're about to get gibbed
[2:57:49] <whittacre> NO, It's gotta be a hot murder
[2:57:51] <conchubar11> inb4 someone copy pastas the bulgie wulgie paragraph
[2:57:52] <Vyskus> this piece is CLEARLY not horny in ANY capacity
[2:57:52] <Dave_booth> semi-chub i would say
[2:57:53] <+Lonewolf2840> footlong out of the frezzer @PlagueOfGripes
[2:57:53] <grouchydata> those claws would be in his FLESH not ripping off his shirt
[2:57:55] <beefomkers> Who's the blue hairy chick

[2:58:01] <DehiDehi> oh he's being murdered?
[2:58:02] <DehiDehi> Kappa
[2:58:05] <+stinkomeanie> Maybe he is well endowed
[2:58:05] <+EyeFarted> Eli, with you it's always weird
[2:58:05] <grouchydata> who the fuck rips off a shirt and THEN murders somebody
[2:58:10] <bevyrage> just because belladona's nipples are perked doesn't mean his need to be as well
[2:58:11] <Nimorp> boner bad, murder good
[2:58:11] <+SlyKnuxRealist4> SlyKnuxRealist4 subscribed at Tier 1. 
[2:58:15] <+UnwoundCaesar70> Shes tearing the shirt to get to the flesh
[2:58:21] <ThisGamingDragon> Murder boner has a whole new meaning now
[2:58:23] <YakumoYomi> It must be "death by snoo-snoo", though.
[2:58:24] <+BubbaRands> That's like semi-hard at best Kappa
[2:58:26] <+Scevda> Hes just gifted, leave anon alone.
[2:58:26] <$RC_S3kshun8> @Nimorp welcome to american cinema
[2:58:29] <grouchydata> those claws are like an inch long, she can get to the flesh already

[2:59:41] <conchubar11> guys she's clearly checking his bodily integrity for breeding potential...... and then she'll kill him
[2:59:47] <$RC_S3kshun8> Well, there are worse ways to go I guess
[2:59:52] <$RC_S3kshun8> Death by MewMew?
[2:59:54] <CalderGaming> dre, there's no excuse for not using your safety properly
[2:59:56] <ChortlesJ1> I don't think Plague has ever done those 'heart pupils' before. makes sense since he's drawing animal eyes half the time
[2:59:56] <beefomkers> >not protagonisting your way out of dying
[2:59:57] <@PeachSaliva> If he doesn’t get a hard pee pee she kill him
[2:59:59] <beefomkers> Weak
[3:00:04] <+ssjklyco> This song has the N-Pass +
[3:00:11] <ThisGamingDragon> everyone worried about a boner and i'm looking at the tuft of furr between her legs
[3:00:23] <+Scevda> Thats poor gun safety!

[3:00:55] <$RC_S3kshun8> @PlagueOfGripes don't forget to draw him a ciggarette
[3:00:58] <+ssjklyco> Feminine PP, Urine trouble
[3:01:03] <+BubbaRands> Feminine PeePee? Traps Kappa
[3:01:07] <beefomkers> That's gay though
[3:01:11] <@PeachSaliva> Can you imagine dying during coitus
[3:01:13] <+Scevda> Snu snu?
[3:01:19] <beefomkers> Why not masculine pussy
[3:01:22] <+stinkomeanie> It's how I'd wanna go out
[3:01:24] <conchubar11> I like to imagine that's how i'd go out
[3:01:28] <hekate1281> Song!
[3:01:31] <conchubar11> that or in my sleep
[3:01:47] <$RC_S3kshun8> @PeachSaliva I think there's a whole TVTropes section devoted to that. 'Going out with a bang' iirc
[3:01:50] <Vyskus> what if you died before you came tho, that would suck
[3:01:51] <+BubbaRands> @beefomkers it's not gay if pee pee feminine Kappa
[3:01:54] <YakumoYomi> Are we circling back around to the "suicide cummer" discussion?
[3:02:08] <beefomkers> @yakumoyomi What
[3:02:10] <+stinkomeanie> why would you care, you'd be dead
[3:02:20] <conchubar11> To quote Hellsing Abridged. "Well, at least I'm going to die with a raging boner"
[3:02:25] <%Samex_Comex> Whoa!
[3:02:32] <+jiggy_snipe> plague playing all the jams
[3:02:40] <%LordSDB> bless you
[3:02:43] <Nimorp> bless you
[3:02:45] <+jiggy_snipe> bless you
[3:02:46] <beefomkers> I love rasta gibberish
[3:02:47] <ThisGamingDragon> god bless you
[3:02:47] <+UnwoundCaesar70> bless u
[3:02:52] <ChortlesJ1> But really though, the ToM remake really is a solid RPG. Honestly surprising it turned out so well
[3:03:26] <conchubar11> I'm just imaging Plague sitting on the front porch of a farm house with his monster bitches listening to this with a straw hat on
[3:03:33] <ThisGamingDragon> @chortlesj1 I've heard weird complaints about it.
[3:03:35] <YakumoYomi> @beefomkers In the most recent DS9 stream, a scenario was proposed in which men would die from ejaculation...but said ejaculation would be REALLY good and result in said male exploding into a cloud of semen
[3:03:47] <beefomkers> Not worth
[3:03:54] <ass_millk> wow plague uh nice drawing :)
[3:04:09] <+jorgamund> not to be the weird guy, but... I honestly appreciate the shading on that belt
[3:04:12] <beefomkers> I'd just become a monk
[3:04:32] <CalderGaming> @jorgamund lots of people forget 3D on the belts!
[3:04:58] <conchubar11> Plague is, if nothing, a man of paying attention to details
[3:04:59] <@PeachSaliva> Yes? :3
[3:05:02] <%Samex_Comex> ping!
[3:05:06] <gsoto83> Always
[3:05:08] <oneyeseesin3d> lol
[3:05:17] <@PeachSaliva> I’m not high!
[3:05:22] <conchubar11> uh huh
[3:05:22] <+Lonewolf2840> @PlagueOfGripes will this be uploaded to Youtube
[3:05:29] <ThisGamingDragon> High...on life...
[3:05:31] <bevyrage> if you smoke weed and lay down you don't get high, you just chill low
[3:05:33] <$RC_S3kshun8> Well, I mean, it's legal and we're all adults
[3:05:33] <+InsaneJackLondon> thats what a high person would say
[3:05:37] <$RC_S3kshun8> wait
[3:05:37] <ChortlesJ1> Like a kite
[3:05:41] <$RC_S3kshun8> no it's not legal everywhere yet
[3:05:44] <$RC_S3kshun8> nevermind
[3:06:01] <gsoto83> sweet, got an easy job tonight
[3:06:03] <beefomkers> Weed is bad for you B)
[3:06:14] <conchubar11> This global lockdown keeps up much longer it's gonna be legal soon enough
[3:06:20] <$RC_S3kshun8> In as much as it makes you hungry and chill, yeah
[3:06:54] <gsoto83> Legal enough for Goverment work
[3:07:01] <+stinkomeanie> Weed come from the dirt, the dirt come from the earth. Dirt don't hurt.
[3:07:22] <+datmegamandeeeee> Play one winged angel
[3:07:36] <beefomkers> Naturalistic fallacy B)
[3:07:37] <bevyrage> imagine if plague could play guitar
[3:07:42] <CalderGaming> well, it's still LA music
[3:07:44] <grouchydata> dirt can hurt if it's a GOLEM
[3:07:46] <beefomkers> Also I don't actually care
[3:07:47] <$RC_S3kshun8> So, Eli, what's this Kitty's motivation here? The Mise-en-scène seems to suggest she's here to perform his circumcision or steal his babies.
[3:08:01] <beefomkers> You can get it
[3:08:02] <+datmegamandeeeee> I could imagine plague playing guitar
[3:08:05] <grouchydata> I feel like this might jsut be role play
[3:08:05] <beefomkers> Anybody can
[3:08:06] <+stinkomeanie> Plague can only play Wonderwall on guitar
[3:08:06] <@PeachSaliva> No you dont
[3:08:07] <conchubar11> Nightshade comes from the dirt, can't really eat that now can you
[3:08:08] <@PeachSaliva> Music sucks
[3:08:09] <+ssjklyco> You could always just write
[3:08:09] <trianglehat> sex murder him
[3:08:09] <DehiDehi> is that lan going to have sex before being murdered
[3:08:12] <@PeachSaliva> I should know
[3:08:13] <BigNerdSam> She wants to see his sick chest tattoo
[3:08:16] <beefomkers> Even if your deaf
[3:08:17] <DeltascapeV4> Snu Snu
[3:08:17] <$RC_S3kshun8> Stupid Sexy Murder
[3:08:18] <zecaptain_james> "murder" yeaaah sure

[3:08:34] <%Samex_Comex> Uh oh she turned into Pat
[3:08:38] <$RC_S3kshun8> Maybe he has mustard in his pants.
[3:08:41] <@Nightbot> Plague is a youtube animator and also streams at https://picarto.tv/Plague . Also: t-shirts! http://goo.gl/lze8QO
[3:08:56] <conchubar11> Is that a bottle of mustard or are you just happy to see me?
[3:08:56] <@PeachSaliva> Oh don’t you start
[3:09:02] <@PeachSaliva> Mister Not a Furry
[3:09:03] <gsoto83> Since male cat dicks are spiked, are female cat vaginas??
[3:09:05] <+jorgamund> what they want to see is worse than that
[3:09:22] <grouchydata> they're in a mutually emotionally supportive and loving relationship and they doin a lil light capture/aggressive seduction RP, aight? WHOLESOME>
[3:09:22] <DehiDehi> plague is the longest running tease artist in the history of the internet he cannot break this streak
[3:09:26] <+Scevda> Tbf, she looks like shes on the down-swing of kneading on him.
[3:09:32] <+EyeFarted> Whoever she is, she must really want that bulgy-wulgy.
[3:09:32] <%Samex_Comex> No snouts allowed
[3:09:33] <zecaptain_james> @gsoto83 google it and report back
[3:09:39] <grouchydata> wait, sorry, "murder" roleplay
[3:09:40] <conchubar11> Is Plague a Furry? Does the Pope shit in the woods?
[3:09:54] <gsoto83> @zecaptain_james I don't what that tainting my google searches lol
[3:10:07] <zecaptain_james> @gsoto83 coward
[3:10:12] <conchubar11> @PlagueOfGripes it was a great song to hear live, that's for sure
[3:10:32] <CalderGaming> from LA to Birmingham
[3:10:38] <beefomkers> Cat vaginas aren't spiked
[3:11:05] <DehiDehi> Do you think men get boners the moment before they die
[3:11:18] <@PeachSaliva> Eli why can’t we be graced with your visage on this day
[3:11:22] <conchubar11> If we consider the biology, she technically won't get pregnant since female felines can't ovulate unless the vagina is damaged by the peenor
[3:11:23] <+datmegamandeeeee> Are they flesh spikes or like... claw spikes?
[3:11:24] <Frogwash> Depends, if they die by bleeding, then no
[3:11:42] <@PeachSaliva> @conchubar11 that’s not true right?
[3:11:51] <CalderGaming> @DehiDehi if executed by hanging, yes
[3:11:56] <DehiDehi> @conchubar11 nani
[3:11:57] <conchubar11> @PeachSaliva entirely scientific fact
[3:12:02] <beefomkers> yeah it's true
[3:12:03] <DehiDehi> @CalderGaming interesting
[3:12:17] <$RC_S3kshun8> jfc. No wonder they shriek when they fuck.
[3:12:18] <%Samex_Comex> Why are all animals fucked up
[3:12:27] <beefomkers> Because they're animals
[3:12:36] <@PeachSaliva> nice
[3:12:36] <+datmegamandeeeee> Ooh
[3:12:41] <$RC_S3kshun8> I knew Ducks were crazy little corkscrew dicked rapists, but I thought cats were normal-er
[3:12:42] <@PeachSaliva> We can hear your balls
[3:12:42] <+ssjklyco> @conchubar11 is that why cats have spike dicks? To attack the puss, litterally?
[3:12:44] <conchubar11> That's why, if you've ever seen lions mating, the female always takes a swipe at him after their done because he's literally drawing blood in her vag
[3:12:45] <beefomkers> Not like they have the capacity to care anyway
[3:13:11] <KellBeII> <3
[3:13:18] <conchubar11> Also, that's why cats are loud as fuck at night when they yowl. They boinking and the missus ain't having much fun
[3:13:23] <DehiDehi> @conchubar11 do cats have like a protective barriere which must be pierced?
[3:13:38] <@PeachSaliva> Dude being a female cat sounds like it blows
[3:13:41] <KellBeII> yoohoo \o/
[3:13:50] <@PeachSaliva> Good thing Elmo’s dick doesn’t work ew
[3:13:51] <CalderGaming> chocolate soda + plain blueberry bagel.... could be worse
[3:13:54] <zecaptain_james> tbh this chat is exactly what i expected from plagues twitch chat, love it
[3:13:55] <KellBeII> itll make you fart
[3:13:57] <CalderGaming> could be an Everything bagel
[3:14:03] <$RC_S3kshun8> I like Asiago bagels.
[3:14:05] <conchubar11> @DehiDehi No, i'm pretty sure it's just the miniscule scratches to the tissue wall that induces the hormone release
[3:14:07] <%Samex_Comex> WutFace
[3:14:09] <beefomkers> Don't think about it and be grateful that you're a smart monkey
[3:14:12] <@PeachSaliva> Yoohoos are gonna give you the toottoots
[3:14:16] <CalderGaming> HAUS MUSIC
[3:14:21] <Treuan> Asiago is amazing. Kind of greasy though
[3:14:23] <+ssjklyco> I had a friend make me a Yoohoo tes leches . It was good.
[3:14:23] <+datmegamandeeeee> I imagine the dick spikes are for rapey cat purposes, not for pleasure
[3:14:26] <beefomkers> Nature isn't fair but we got lucky

[3:14:56] <conchubar11> Well, relatively fast. The err... jizzism... sticks around for a bit and takes a second y'know
[3:15:00] <+datmegamandeeeee> I’m just vibin’
[3:15:01] <@PeachSaliva> Don’t you go around telling lies
[3:15:07] <gsoto83> @RC_S3kshun8 didn't you sign up for the N-Word Plus plan?
[3:15:08] <grouchydata> this is chaos
[3:15:12] <conchubar11> But that's always why lions will have sex continuously throughout the day
[3:15:13] <$RC_S3kshun8> Nevermind that shit! Here comes Mongo!

[3:15:32] <CalderGaming> you'll have to be more specific
[3:15:34] <$RC_S3kshun8> The one where the Rock humps the dude's leg?
[3:15:38] <+Scevda> And I am here as well, i don’t belong anywhere.
[3:15:52] <DehiDehi> so uh
[3:15:56] <$RC_S3kshun8> @gsoto83 I know that exists, but I haven't listened to the latest podcast yet.
[3:15:57] <Treuan> That's a feel @Scevda
[3:16:06] <conchubar11> You want interesting penises though, you should google what an echnidna dick looks like
[3:16:06] <+IMDRanged> I only remembered that skit from the one David Duchovney was promoting XFiles Fight the Future
[3:16:08] <DehiDehi> if we make catgirls, can we take out the scraping the vagina feature ?
[3:16:13] <+EyeFarted> Chris Kattan
[3:16:18] <Huntercd> The one with Ben Affleck? and what's his name?
[3:16:31] <gsoto83> @RC_S3kshun8 oh boy, sit down for A LONG ASS RANT lol
[3:16:33] <$RC_S3kshun8> @PlagueOfGripes Ohh, my bad. For some reason I thought the Rock's character was named Mango in that Skit. It was like 15yr ago, but The Rock was dressed in tribal stuff humping some dude's leg
[3:16:39] <+stinkomeanie> You can't touch a da mango!
[3:16:43] <+datmegamandeeeee> Lol
[3:16:53] <conchubar11> I mean, that's technically an advantage? She won't get preggers unless you but on... an attachment... if you will
[3:16:57] <Huntercd> Yea
[3:17:03] <conchubar11> Bunnygirls are the same
[3:17:19] <DehiDehi> that's right
[3:17:23] <StridentSong> Mango?
[3:17:24] <%Samex_Comex> So we got Gripelings, Zonelings, and what ever Paige and Woolie's fans are called watching
[3:17:24] <+EyeFarted> Also Kattan. He's very versatile
[3:17:31] <ReNhoSoft1> oh dang, did I just catch the tail end of the stream?
[3:17:31] <conchubar11> Rabbits can choose to absorb a growing embryo and not let the pregnancy carry if they think it's not the right time
[3:17:32] <Huntercd> And Mango would shoot them down
[3:17:37] <$RC_S3kshun8> @PlagueOfGripes Thank you! Yep it was the Papa Peepers bit I was thinking of
[3:17:37] <DehiDehi> would you like your catgirl to have 2 pairs of ears?
[3:17:44] <Treuan> Mustardlings I guess
[3:17:46] <DehiDehi> @conchubar11 WHAT

[3:18:02] <CalderGaming> @DehiDehi I hate the human ears + cat ears thing
[3:18:07] <+stinkomeanie> Would SNL's Mango fly now or would it some sort of Ru Paul Drag Race type appreciation?

[3:19:39] <gasgrave> I love this song, but the lyrics sound like a 6-year-old bragging
[3:19:44] <conchubar11> The things you learn when your ex was a vet student lol
[3:19:52] <DehiDehi> @conchubar11 and you're not a furry, right? Kappa
[3:19:52] <@PeachSaliva> @gasgrave aahaha

[3:20:20] <DehiDehi> oh no
[3:20:36] <JackalKing> Stupid songs that rule are the best songs
[3:20:36] <gasgrave> true on both counts
[3:20:50] <@PeachSaliva> Everyone in here is a furry led by their king of kings here
[3:20:58] <+LethalweaponLord> this is definitely one of the best looking cat ladies I ever seen
[3:21:11] <Jeemukun> I know what I am
[3:21:24] <skullkid456> say it with me everyone, "not a furry"
[3:21:25] <Daxalog> I really hope she dosnt damage that mans shirt.
[3:21:28] <DehiDehi> @PeachSaliva what's your fursona Kappa
[3:21:46] <JackalKing> @Daxalog bit late for that
[3:21:51] <conchubar11> I could imagine @PeachSaliva being a redhaired giraffe
[3:22:01] <+EyeFarted> WE KNOW WHAT WE'RE ABOUT PAIGE
[3:22:05] <@PeachSaliva> Some say it is a possum, others a raccoon
[3:22:08] <grouchydata> Allegedly
[3:22:09] <+stinkomeanie> gotta make super grits
[3:22:09] <YakumoYomi> Her fursona is that thing sitting to Pat's right (off screen) when they stream
[3:22:11] <MKUltima> I'd say mine's a panda
[3:22:14] <DehiDehi> I'd see Paige as a beautiful gold fish with red locks of flowing hair
[3:22:17] <skullkid456> @PeachSaliva not a bat?
[3:22:18] <%Samex_Comex> Pat hungry need food!
[3:22:20] <@PeachSaliva> Are you seriously telling me to get back in the kitchen???
[3:22:23] <Jeemukun> I like how she's calling us furries when she's actually been to furcons
[3:22:23] <Wiley_boi> @PlagueOfGripes Doesn't she look like the female version of the digimon WereGarurumon?
[3:22:23] <MKUltima> Or a cat
[3:22:24] <+RenoDeGeneric> I kneel to the furry gateway drug
[3:22:26] <conchubar11> Paige's fursona is Steve Buscemi
[3:22:27] <CalderGaming> oh god I thought this was kermit the frog for a second
[3:22:28] <+ssjklyco> someone has to make sure the house does not burn down when food is made

[3:23:21] <+absolute_weapon> Dan of Biscuits sounds like my cousin

[3:24:21] <+Scevda> Great, now I want biscuits....
[3:24:22] <+RenoDeGeneric> Daniel Southworth of Biscuits?
[3:24:37] <@PeachSaliva> I could never be mad at Eli, only constantly irritated beyond belief
[3:24:39] <grouchydata> mmmmm buttermil biscuits
[3:24:42] <conchubar11> I can't wait for a good 300 years to go by and Plague's art is considered genius erotica by a misunderstood master
[3:24:47] <grouchydata> gib me the biscs
[3:24:54] <+Spiggerus> going to have to have a cold shower after this stream
[3:24:55] <@PeachSaliva> Pat just said, “Man, why is that guy so asshole?”
[3:25:04] <Daxalog> "so asshole"?
[3:25:09] <grouchydata> a mystery that troubles civilizations
[3:25:09] <Nimorp> nice
[3:25:10] <+absolute_weapon> Sounds like pat
[3:25:13] <%KaiserMario> Which asshole?
[3:25:14] <DehiDehi> s o a s s h o l e
[3:25:15] <skullkid456> so much asshole
[3:25:26] <+EyeFarted> S O A S S H O L E
[3:25:30] <grouchydata> high % asshole, as % asshole go
[3:25:40] <grouchydata> was there a comma
[3:25:45] <grouchydata> "so, asshole?"
[3:25:57] <conchubar11> All of man's problems usually end with, wow that guy was a douche canoe
[3:25:59] <+stinkomeanie> Oh i remember this anime
[3:26:03] <Indainity> Kikaider soundtrack so nice.
[3:26:08] <+Scevda> 50% so, 50% asshole
[3:26:08] <%Samex_Comex> Sad kikaider song
[3:26:10] <CalderGaming> OHHHH FEELS BAD MAN
[3:26:11] <DehiDehi> SourPls
[3:26:20] <%Samex_Comex> Good sad
[3:26:25] <+Cook_4_Souls> Sweet the kikaider theme song
[3:26:29] <+ssjklyco> I have not seen Kikaider in so long
[3:26:51] <Jeemukun> i've never seen kikaider so i'm wondering why this sounds familiar
[3:26:58] <%KaiserMario> Hey Plague, can you look up "song of the freedom fighters"? Wait... you don't take suggestions, do you?
[3:27:27] <CalderGaming> @jeemukun did you maybe catch it on the tail end of a session of adult swim/toonami or something?
[3:27:37] <+Scevda> He doesnt, only begrudging switches to songs he already has afaict
[3:27:51] <Jeemukun> @CalderGaming i'm canadian so definitely not sadly
[3:27:52] <%KaiserMario> yeah, i forgot
[3:28:01] <YakumoYomi> Kikaider? The anime, or the live action show from the 70s?
[3:28:08] <+RenoDeGeneric> Even if the band is good live I usually always prefer a studio version for at home listening
[3:28:12] <+Spiggerus> rimlight my penis, daddy
[3:28:38] <pinchbara> Just started and I already love your stream
[3:28:38] <CalderGaming> rimfire my- no never mind
[3:29:08] <%Samex_Comex> Headbanging time!
[3:29:08] <skullkid456> this some hype music
[3:29:12] <CalderGaming> fitting music for the visuals
[3:29:14] <+Scevda> Whats the oldest console you own Eli?
[3:29:21] <+RenoDeGeneric> I thought this was Zombie
[3:29:35] <JackalKing> Is it not Zombie?
[3:30:02] <%KaiserMario> Isn't this from Twisted Metal?
[3:30:04] <+RenoDeGeneric> Nah it absolutely is. I just dunno if it's White or just Rob
[3:30:30] <+Scevda> Any chance twisted metal gets a reboot going forward?
[3:30:36] <%Samex_Comex> He mostly listens to White Zombie
[3:31:06] <+RenoDeGeneric> Since it got one on PS3 I'm sure we could see another Twisted Metal. That's handled by Santa Monica now right?
[3:32:04] <zamzoph> Who need backgrounds anyway?
[3:32:17] <+Typhaeon> Wish I'd held onto my Atari 2600
[3:32:22] <%Samex_Comex> Don't have your Game Gear anymore?
[3:32:28] <+Scevda> Okay, cool, thanks for replying.
[3:32:36] <+stinkomeanie> Fucking love this song
[3:32:45] <+stinkomeanie> Big fan of Wham and George Michael
[3:33:23] <+stinkomeanie> Plague do you like Last Christmas by Wham?
[3:33:26] <CalderGaming> red in the background helps get across that this is a murder scenario
[3:33:43] <TimetodiveLTX> tfw you didn't realize the music was pitch shifted until it wasn't
[3:34:10] <+Typhaeon> Yep, low latency will do that
[3:35:04] <skullkid456> well, this song is added to my music library now. Thanks Plague!
[3:35:39] <+MrPervSan> I keep coming back to this stream. Watching the progress from each time is pretty cool.
[3:35:48] <CalderGaming> 80s british pop was a lot of what I grew up listening to in the car. thanks dad
[3:36:07] <CalderGaming> Tears For Fears, anyone?
[3:38:06] <Midos1717> somebody tell me
[3:38:09] <Jeemukun> tears for fears is great
[3:38:16] <DrFaustMD> somebody body body
[3:38:22] <+Spiggerus> What graphics tablet do you use?
[3:39:07] <CalderGaming> OH NO
[3:39:09] <CalderGaming> NOT ME
[3:39:30] <Jeemukun> it's a crime that the nirvana cover is more popular than this version
[3:39:42] <SirPuppytear> Yo, I just have to throw this out there, big fan of your art.
[3:39:46] <+stinkomeanie> Plague you ever watched that SNL performance of David Bowie singing with Klaus Nomi?
[3:39:51] <SirPuppytear> Not even the theme, but the style is top notch.
[3:39:51] <%KaiserMario> Oh golly, MGSV ost
[3:39:52] <+DakotaMacDoodle> I've been listening to a lot of Oingo Boingo lately.
[3:39:54] <elf4000> "It has been. . . 9 years. "
[3:40:09] <+EyeFarted> I'm sorry, but I like the Nirvana Unplugged version better
[3:40:09] <+YelloGek> That's some good musics.
[3:40:40] <CalderGaming> this is a pretty recent song to have three well-known versions (this one by Midge Ure, the Nirvana cover, and the Bowie original)
[3:40:45] <+stinkomeanie> Bowie and Klaus Nomi sang this song together, but Bowie really struggled to keep up with Nomi due to his classical opera training.
[3:41:09] <+DakotaMacDoodle> The Nirvana cover is great but I like original better
[3:42:58] <DrFaustMD> You feel it too dont you...
[3:43:31] <DrFaustMD> Bowie's is too upbeat
[3:44:01] <CalderGaming> remember that time bowie starred in a movie as an alien who couldn't sing at all
[3:44:16] <DrFaustMD> Omikron?
[3:44:21] <+Typhaeon> Featuring a sex scene with a gun
[3:44:28] <CalderGaming> Typhaeon got it
[3:44:43] <+stinkomeanie> Synths are great
[3:45:07] <shameimarusen> Synth is rad
[3:45:10] <elf4000> Musicians love messing with new sounds and instruments, it was only natural that the 80's were going to have a lot of synths
[3:45:23] <CalderGaming> psaBig 70's
[3:46:02] <+Cook_4_Souls> A lot of great hits came from those drum machines
[3:46:02] <+Typhaeon> There was a lot of synth use in 80s music, but at least it lent a distinctive sound. Music started getting more and more forgettable from the early 00s on
[3:46:03] <@PeachSaliva> I don’t think many people blush during a MURDER
[3:46:18] <Nimorp> i like how the background looks a bit like moon texture
[3:46:19] <CalderGaming> @PeachSaliva have you heard of Killing Eve
[3:46:36] <trianglehat> catgirls are not people
[3:46:40] <+JailShmixRemix> Yes
[3:46:42] <+Typhaeon> That's why they call it blushlust
[3:46:44] <zecaptain_james> yes..... i mean NO
[3:46:45] <Jeemukun> you can't know that
[3:46:45] <+Spiggerus> I wish belladona would murder me
[3:46:47] <+Scevda> Hot Blooded
[3:46:47] <@PeachSaliva> Don’t I?
[3:46:50] <%Samex_Comex> Teehee i'm stabbing you
[3:46:52] <SirPuppytear> If you find murdering hot, you blush when you do it, duh.
[3:46:54] <@PeachSaliva> Maybe I have!
[3:46:54] <CursedNobleman> thats a vixen furry for one thing
[3:46:56] <%KaiserMario> Is Pat blushing right now, murdering his beard?
[3:47:07] <+Scevda> Wait, Peach is actually a bit of an authority on this.
[3:47:12] <Jeemukun> if peach had actually killed someone plague would be one of the first to know
[3:47:15] <+EyeFarted> Didn't Paige kill that woman's baby?
[3:47:29] <@PeachSaliva> Oh, Plague would be the first person I’d ask to help me hide the body
[3:47:31] <@PeachSaliva> For sure
[3:47:31] <+EyeFarted> Or fetus?
[3:47:40] <@PeachSaliva> She was barren!!
[3:47:47] <%LordSDB> I just keep hearing Plague, staying can you not this whole stream LUL
[3:47:57] <YakumoYomi> OBJECTION!
[3:48:01] <@PeachSaliva> There was nothing in there but webs and busboy cum
[3:48:10] <+EyeFarted> Yeah, after you did what you did, Pige
[3:48:17] <+absolute_weapon> That was a sentance
[3:48:17] <%KaiserMario> Plague knows of that special place inside a tractor that can conceal a body
[3:48:19] <+Typhaeon> I'm not sure which is more revolting
[3:48:30] <@Nightbot> Plague is a youtube animator and also streams at https://picarto.tv/Plague . Also: t-shirts! http://goo.gl/lze8QO
[3:48:33] <trianglehat> pigs
[3:48:37] <%Samex_Comex> Feed it the pigs
[3:48:40] <+EyeFarted> OR TIGERS
[3:48:40] <%Samex_Comex> Oh
[3:48:45] <+stinkomeanie> @peachsaliva how did Pat’s shaving go?
[3:48:48] <YakumoYomi> Feed it to their next of kin
[3:48:48] <+zanny> sometimes you just gotta pig out
[3:48:53] <+Typhaeon> Grind the bones into meal and fertilize the fields with it
[3:48:54] <TimetodiveLTX> Necro has a good song about body disposal, he sounds like he knows what he's talking about
[3:48:55] <@PeachSaliva> See? That’s why I need you for murder
[3:48:57] <Jeemukun> I AIN'T HAPPY
[3:49:00] <Explodincatz> hotness in a case
[3:49:01] <CalderGaming> OH MUH CHILDHOOD
[3:49:07] <Jeemukun> still love gorillaz
[3:49:24] <Jeemukun> humaz was a bit shit tho
[3:49:26] <CalderGaming> ghost del tha funk homosapien is watching you fap
[3:49:29] <Explodincatz> play the in a bag remix
[3:49:33] <CalderGaming> *funky
[3:49:42] <%KaiserMario> Isn't feeding a body to pigs just a waste of free meat?
[3:49:46] <chronoxgp> panstu
[3:50:09] <+Typhaeon> That human wasn't free range organic. You don't know how it was brought up
[3:50:22] <chronoxgp> missing whiskers
[3:50:36] <YakumoYomi> Real baby back ribs...
[3:50:37] <Maids4lyfe> full of preservatives and antibiotics Kappa
[3:50:38] <%KaiserMario> Everything tastes good barbequed
[3:50:42] <+kiwiredgrave> Yeah, we need whiskers
[3:50:46] <chronoxgp> like giant eye brow whiskers
[3:50:51] <@PeachSaliva> She plucks her whiskers like a real lady
[3:51:00] <+Heart0fInk> See? that's murder sweat
[3:51:00] <Maids4lyfe> ouch
[3:51:13] <CalderGaming> wouldn't that dull her senses
[3:51:14] <chronoxgp> it looks like krystal from starfox adventures
[3:51:20] <%KaiserMario> @PlagueOfGripes Plague, furry animals don't sweat, they droll
[3:51:22] <YakumoYomi> This may seem ignorant, but...do felines have sweat glands?
[3:51:30] <CalderGaming> ...is paige blind because she trims HER whiskers?!
[3:51:45] <chronoxgp> whiskers just protect them from falling out of trees
[3:51:51] <chronoxgp> and walking into doors
[3:51:57] <%KaiserMario> LUL
[3:52:14] <CalderGaming> @chronoxgp that's what I thought at first but chat context clues indicate that it's true-form Belladonna from Trials of Mana
[3:52:15] <bevyrage> yeah
[3:52:16] <YakumoYomi> I'm tired of you making fun of my voice, Eli.
[3:52:18] <Jeemukun> who cares about some dumb human
[3:52:18] <%Samex_Comex> WutFace
[3:52:19] <@PeachSaliva> Thought of what
[3:52:23] <+taku_toots> ?
[3:52:28] <zamzoph> I don't even know what this is
[3:52:30] <+UnwoundCaesar70> Ooo Like Cheetah
[3:52:30] <bevyrage> or maybe the original sprite was just a general recolor of her human sprite
[3:52:31] <+REDtheBEAST> walrusMeow walrusF
[3:52:32] <chronoxgp> spoilers
[3:52:32] <@PeachSaliva> Hahaha
[3:52:35] <@PeachSaliva> So sassy
[3:52:39] <Nimorp> loud noises :(
[3:52:39] <Indainity> waow
[3:52:47] <+IMDRanged> Argonians tho
[3:52:48] <Indainity> such sass, much sarcasm
[3:52:49] <Maids4lyfe> LUL
[3:52:57] <+Scevda> Birds do have tits, just not in that way.
[3:52:57] <+EyeFarted> In this poor pitiful world, they don't...
[3:52:57] <+taku_toots> but there is a bird called a titmouse
[3:52:58] <+jorgamund> wait they don't? I need to use different reference photos
[3:53:00] <gsoto83> But x-com 2 has shown us that Sneks do have tits. BIG TITS
[3:53:02] <YakumoYomi> I'm not comfortable with this level of sass...
[3:53:04] <Jeemukun> snakes ain't got arms or legs either so who gives a fuck
[3:53:09] <bevyrage> birds don't have tits. some birds just ARE tits!
[3:53:14] <%KaiserMario> LUL Sorry, but I had to!
[3:53:15] <CalderGaming> sry not sry, 25 year old game Kappa
[3:53:20] <sosuke5> Darkest Dungeon narrator: *gasp*
[3:53:20] <+Heart0fInk> now make lizards with more breasts
[3:53:23] <TimetodiveLTX> it's my fetish , i ain't gotta explain s h i t
[3:53:26] <Nimorp> Akctualy
[3:53:35] <+IMDRanged> yovgWait
[3:53:37] <+ssjklyco> A humonoid animal does not exist, so you don't know they don't have breast.
[3:53:37] <+REDtheBEAST> WHAT!? THEY DON"T!? NotLikeThis
[3:53:38] <bevyrage> i can hear the swirly glasses
[3:53:42] <+AkumaFtw> cirD
[3:53:44] <YakumoYomi> But snek titties, tho...!
[3:53:47] <@PeachSaliva> Well well
[3:53:47] <Curopium> accurate biology is my kink
[3:53:49] <SonicRush1987> Am I the only one who played Trials of Mana in this chat? Just curious.
[3:53:49] <Ipsenscastle> I demand scientifically accurate Interspecies Reviewers egg-laying
[3:53:54] <Nimorp> this voice kinda good, ngl
[3:54:11] <Maids4lyfe> lol
[3:54:18] <CursedNobleman> furry animals dont sweat. they pant LUL
[3:54:18] <grouchydata> *pushes up glasses*
[3:54:19] <+Scevda> Thats exactly what gets her going.
[3:54:20] <marlowe86> Some spiders lactate. Explain that.
[3:54:28] <Ipsenscastle> This voice is how I always imagined Plague speaking before he first guested on the podcast
[3:54:31] <YakumoYomi> @SonicRush1987 Original, or remake? I've played the original many times, but I'm only a few hours into the remake.
[3:54:31] <Maids4lyfe> pigeons give milk
[3:54:44] <+LethalweaponLord> oh god i see drool gptvBlush
[3:54:49] <%Skittlesoul> Skittlesoul subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 2 months! are there plans for more gripes like the villains one?
[3:54:50] <%KaiserMario> You see, the fur would just absorb the moisture, so it would create those drips LUL
[3:54:51] <CalderGaming> uh oh Creed time
[3:55:02] <+mythology333> It's crazy how a few little changed changes the tone of the whole pic. This is one of my many reasons I can't draw, I'd never think to add half these details.
[3:55:04] <@PeachSaliva> Play the Jesus songs
[3:55:05] <%Samex_Comex> I got a friend in Jesus?
[3:55:09] <sosuke5> It's funny that ape anthro furry stuff isn't more prevalent
[3:55:11] <@Nightbot> @DrFaustMD -> How embarrassing! [stop spamming emotes] [warning]
[3:55:35] <SonicRush1987> I've played the ROM of OG Trials back in the day. 3rd time through on the remake.
[3:55:36] <bevyrage> @sosuke5 uncanny valley is a thing and i think nintendo would sue for encroaching on their donkey kong IP
[3:55:38] <Soviicoon> Bulgy Wulgy
[3:55:39] <Ipsenscastle> @PeachSaliva Have you ever commissioned skeletons from Plague or is that a bit like asking a friend for sexual favours?
[3:55:40] <DrFaustMD> oh no. my Jesus hands were spam
[3:55:44] <gsoto83> Jesus agrees Slap them titties
[3:56:01] <CalderGaming> if it's a commission it's not a favor, it's a financial transaction... or it SHOULD be
[3:56:16] <@PeachSaliva> @ipsenscastle I have not commissioned Plague for my sinful pleasures, no. I don’t think he wants to.
[3:56:25] <bevyrage> does he want the money though
[3:56:26] <@PeachSaliva> I have commissioned others, however.
[3:56:27] <CalderGaming> *right to refuse ofc)
[3:56:28] <bevyrage> that's much more important
[3:56:35] <Ipsenscastle> Plague likes to draw them juicy, that's true
[3:56:43] <+REDtheBEAST> Hmm, this better not awaken anything in me...
[3:56:46] <@PeachSaliva> See?
[3:56:49] <bevyrage> wait what about drawing a juicy orb pat
[3:56:54] <@PeachSaliva> Hahahah
[3:57:03] <CalderGaming> why would you need that drawn when the real thing is right there
[3:57:10] <bevyrage> for when he isn't in the room
[3:57:12] <zamzoph> Play some Newsboys
[3:57:18] <bevyrage> so she can gaze upon it and sigh longingly
[3:57:19] <sosuke5> But that takes effort
[3:57:19] <CalderGaming> "draw a circle. draw the rest of the fucking pat"
[3:57:20] <DrFaustMD> but then you can't jack off to it
[3:57:21] <Ipsenscastle> I've considered doing commissions before but the idea of charging makes me so anxious
[3:57:26] <+taku_toots> 'mouth popping sounds' yep
[3:57:28] <+DakotaMacDoodle> oh man it sure is
[3:57:29] <bevyrage> then go downstairs and mess with pat
[3:57:32] <%KaiserMario> @PeachSaliva Have you heard of "Skeleton Soldier couldn't protect the dungeon"? The protagonist is a sexy squeleton trying to save a sexy redhead lady necromancer
[3:57:34] <%Samex_Comex> Do a tri-fusion of Pat, Elmo, and a Skeleton
[3:57:36] <TimetodiveLTX> that's hype
[3:57:46] <+Heart0fInk> i'm still working on that myself. still pretty shitty at it
[3:57:49] <+Scevda> Can I get a confirmation whether or not that Plague still does commissions?
[3:57:49] <gsoto83> Beloved Child?
[3:57:50] <+LethalweaponLord> that's already first on my list of super powers LUL
[3:57:51] <@PeachSaliva> Lmaoooo noooo
[3:57:58] <Ipsenscastle> Also come to think of it, if someone asked me to draw skeletons, drawing all those ribs would be hell
[3:58:10] <bevyrage> drawing skeleton ribs isn't actually that rough?
[3:58:24] <@PeachSaliva> Skeletons are incredibly difficult to draw
[3:58:24] <+absolute_weapon> Suppose it depends on how you approach them
[3:58:25] <bevyrage> it's a bit tedious but the shoulders are more difficult than the rest of the body imo
[3:58:31] <%Skittlesoul> who or what is plague drawing?
[3:58:35] <@PeachSaliva> Aren’t they?
[3:58:39] <@PeachSaliva> That’s what everyone tells me
[3:58:45] <bevyrage> yeah it's because it's like
[3:58:57] <@PeachSaliva> The pelvis alone is like what the hell is goibg on
[3:59:00] <@PeachSaliva> Omg Plague bo
[3:59:01] <bevyrage> collar bone loops over the joint and connects to the shoulder blade
[3:59:02] <@PeachSaliva> Not here
[3:59:02] <+taku_toots> was it a skeleton holding a plate of spaghetti?
[3:59:02] <Ipsenscastle> Drawing skulls is the fun bit, the rest is too much like architecture
[3:59:09] <@PeachSaliva> And it was wonderful
[3:59:19] <@PeachSaliva> I was very grateful for my sinful miracle thank u
[3:59:24] <%KaiserMario> Not so much they are hard to draw, it's just that they have a lot of weird shapes that most people aren't used to drawing
[3:59:31] <bevyrage> nah with the pelvis you draw a bowl and shape it like a weird ass flower
[3:59:47] <+Scevda> Was it a skeleton going grocery shopping and selecting wonderbread from the bread aisle?
[3:59:50] <bevyrage> then remove the bottom of the bowl
[4:00:11] <sosuke5> @PeachSaliva wha's your opinion on an anthropomorphized furry creature, but as a skeleton. Or do they need to be humanoid?
[4:00:37] <+absolute_weapon> Also I share your hesitation lpsenscastle, expecting someone to pay for my scratchings of "art" is somewhat nervewracking
[4:00:39] <@PeachSaliva> I prefer humanoid skeleton
[4:00:41] <DrFaustMD> happy Cinco de mayo
[4:00:42] <CalderGaming> @Skittlesoul belladonna from trials of mana
[4:00:46] <+taku_toots> Party time!
[4:00:54] <@PeachSaliva> If they have like, a tail or ears or whatever on a skelly it does nothing tho it is cool
[4:01:04] <%Samex_Comex> What about Transmetal 2 Dinobot?
[4:01:09] <Jeemukun> reminds i was playing tropico 5 eariler today, good times
[4:01:12] <+stinkomeanie> Ricky Fucking Martin
[4:01:14] <Ipsenscastle> I half wish I understood the skelly fetish more, but I'm worried if I ask for any details I'll contract it somehow
[4:01:15] <+stinkomeanie> Lol
[4:01:16] <%Skittlesoul> @caldergaming ahh neat thanks
[4:01:23] <Jeemukun> viva el presidente
[4:01:23] <@PeachSaliva> Transmetal 2 Dinobot is the exception
[4:01:31] <+stinkomeanie> Damn I haven’t heard Ricky Martin since I was a kid
[4:01:44] <@PeachSaliva> TM2 Dinobot is so fine
[4:01:45] <Ipsenscastle> @PeachSaliva what about a Terminator?
[4:01:54] <@PeachSaliva> I have an action figure of him I still sleep with
[4:01:56] <+bakedbodado> Don't know if you will get mad if I recommend music but Buena Vista Social Club is a good spanish album
[4:01:59] <@PeachSaliva> Terminator is meh
[4:02:02] <@PeachSaliva> Weirdly does nothinf
[4:02:05] <%KaiserMario> @PeachSaliva What do you think of Jack Skellington? Is he hot?
[4:02:15] <+stinkomeanie> Of Terminator or Ricky Martin? @peachsaliva
[4:02:15] <@Nightbot> @TreeeFOX -> Suboptimal. [stop spamming emotes] [warning]
[4:02:33] <+taku_toots> Maybe terminator is too tall?
[4:02:41] <@PeachSaliva> @kaisermario he’s okay. He’s like a 6/10 for me. His voice is gorge tho
[4:02:50] <+TreeeFOX> is there fur on her nipples?
[4:03:09] <Ipsenscastle> Do you think of the skeletons as ex-people, or creatures in and of themselves?
[4:03:18] <+Scevda> Hes probably too ghoul and not enough skelly
[4:03:21] <JackalKing> The real question is whether Peach sides with Nagash or the Tomb Kings. Battle of the Bone Daddies!
[4:03:22] <%KaiserMario> Isn't his singing voice by Danny Elfman?
[4:03:29] <@PeachSaliva> If they walking and talking, they are formerly people but now ~other~
[4:03:39] <+REDtheBEAST> Loveing skeletons is like an extreme form of "inner beauty" walrusCant
[4:03:39] <@PeachSaliva> Yep Danny Elfman does the singing
[4:03:46] <%Skittlesoul> @peachsaliva so what about dry bones or dry bowser?
[4:03:53] <YakumoYomi> The storm outside has gotten pretty noisy. My death may be approaching.
[4:03:56] <@PeachSaliva> What can I say? I love you for what’s on the inside. 💀
[4:03:58] <pikastation> What's up everyone
[4:04:23] <+Scevda> With a last name like “Elfman” lets face it, you are kind of fated to be a bard.
[4:04:31] <+Heart0fInk> Sup @pikastation
[4:04:42] <Ipsenscastle> Nah my skeleton's rubbish, it just breaks all the time lol
[4:04:49] <+BubbaRands> que musica?!
[4:04:58] <+IMDRanged> Did the dood's bulge get larger as time went on?
[4:05:02] <greendude77> yooo
[4:05:08] <Jeemukun> I'm impressed with myself that I've never broken a bone, aside from my skull once
[4:05:18] <Ipsenscastle> @IMDRanged that's usually how it works, ideally
[4:05:22] <+absolute_weapon> My skeleton has a defective back
[4:05:27] <%Skittlesoul> @imdranged no you're just focused on it
[4:05:37] <%KaiserMario> You can't get more naked than a skeleton
[4:05:44] <Ipsenscastle> @Jeemukun that's a pretty bad bone to break though
[4:05:47] <+IMDRanged> Ok. yovgOops yovgStare
[4:05:49] <%KaiserMario> OH MAN
[4:05:54] <%KaiserMario> I LOVE THIS ONE
[4:05:58] <JackalKing> You know, the natural conclusion of skeletons being sexual beings is that Gravelord Nito is really just a giant orgy pile that gained sentience.
[4:06:00] <@PeachSaliva> Oh wow now we’ve got steam!!!
[4:06:30] <DrFaustMD> hey, this is the opening to the History on Fire podcast
[4:06:35] <Jeemukun> nice
[4:06:36] <%KaiserMario> Damn, Leone's a boss
[4:06:52] <Jeemukun> I think this is the metallica S&M version?
[4:06:54] <TimetodiveLTX> not sure if we're talking about the song (banger), JackalKing's post, or the literal steam
[4:07:27] <grouchydata> Hell yes Morricone
[4:07:27] <zamzoph> This sounds familiar...
[4:07:41] <grouchydata> Ecstasy of Gold, from Good, the bad, and the Ugly
[4:07:43] <CalderGaming> @KaiserMario this Skeleton Soldier Couldn't Protect the Dungeon comic is pretty grim
[4:07:50] <%KaiserMario> Sorry, Ennio, Morricone is the composer
[4:07:56] <Jeemukun> S&M is the only good Metallica album, fight me
[4:07:57] <+IMDRanged> This song sometimes makes me dizzy
[4:08:00] <zamzoph> @grouchydata oh, that's it
[4:08:20] <+Heart0fInk> I'm Heart. Hi
[4:08:24] <ScreamLord> @PlagueOfGripes What is this character? I just joined in
[4:08:28] <%KaiserMario> @CalderGaming It has some humor in it, but it's not a comedy, despite the dumb name
[4:09:12] <trianglehat> dick on fire?
[4:09:19] <+YelloGek> What's on the screen might make me feel funny when I glance over, but the DJ-work here is well worth the confusion.
[4:09:19] <YakumoYomi> Segata...Sanshiro! Segata...Sanshiro! Sega Saturn...shiro!
[4:09:28] <+sparkysparks_> oh nice, Belladonna. Trials of Mana was a good game.
[4:09:33] <@Nightbot> Plague is a youtube animator and also streams at https://picarto.tv/Plague . Also: t-shirts! http://goo.gl/lze8QO
[4:09:37] <+RenoDeGeneric> Oh man I come back and we in sex steam land

[4:12:23] <TimetodiveLTX> razer chroma addon in the works

[4:12:51] <+RoninRorinth> sweat
[4:12:54] <@PeachSaliva> 7 vagainas
[4:12:55] <+Heart0fInk> Do what other artists do and just put in a normal ass real picture in the background and use like some kinda smudge filter on it. Kappa
[4:12:56] <+jiggy_snipe> lol
[4:13:27] <+JailShmixRemix> Murdering is hard work
[4:13:30] <+BubbaRands> like a sauna Kappa
[4:13:31] <@PeachSaliva> Eli you son of a bitcg
[4:13:34] <+Scevda> In where?
[4:13:40] <+sparkysparks_> Big Sweaty
[4:13:41] <%KaiserMario> "in there"? In where? In the painting?
[4:13:47] <+RoninRorinth> she doesnt have sweat glands paige
[4:13:49] <zamzoph> I just realized Pat's taking the whole week off FeelsBadMan
[4:14:23] <+RoninRorinth> psaGoblin
[4:14:34] <@PeachSaliva> Pat smells
[4:14:40] <%KaiserMario> Pat will be at Dark Souls 2
[4:14:47] <%KaiserMario> He promised
[4:14:50] <KellBeII> Pat is the smeeliest
[4:15:10] <+RoninRorinth> get the hose paige, gotta spray him down
[4:15:17] <%caramello_man> how do you know plague? do you smell him often?
[4:15:19] <%Samex_Comex> He will never know
[4:15:21] <arkv01> I worry about pats folds
[4:15:24] <foulfoamz> He's an orb full of foul smells
[4:15:27] <+REDtheBEAST> Paige we all know that Pats a smelly boy Kappa
[4:15:29] <@PeachSaliva> I smelled Plague once
[4:15:31] <+Heart0fInk> What does Pat smell like?
[4:15:34] <YakumoYomi> Speaking Dark Souls: did you play Dark Souls 3, Eli? My memory fails me.
[4:15:40] <@PeachSaliva> He smells like clean laundry and SIN
[4:15:43] <Ipsenscastle> I'm always shocked when people say Pat doesn't smell
[4:15:47] <%caramello_man> plague smells like broken dreams
[4:15:58] <@PeachSaliva> Pat doesn’t smell. He’s like a rabbit— zero scent.
[4:16:00] <foulfoamz> Wait has pat ever worn like cologne or anything?
[4:16:08] <Ipsenscastle> Paige what do Will & Grace smell like
[4:16:14] <@PeachSaliva> Nah. He likes scent less products
[4:16:16] <arkv01> mmmm plague smells like tide gentle and free
[4:16:16] <Ipsenscastle> And also how did that work
[4:16:23] <+Heart0fInk> Rabbits smell. i know. i used to have rabbits
[4:16:24] <%KaiserMario> I always thought Plague smelled like a damp meadow and smashed pine cones
[4:16:31] <@PeachSaliva> Will & Grace smell like a warm hug :3
[4:16:35] <Ipsenscastle> aww
[4:16:46] <+RoninRorinth> is plague stuttering for anyone else?
[4:16:48] <@PeachSaliva> A warm, gay hug
[4:16:57] <YakumoYomi> Jack and Karen, on the other hand, smell like Vicodin and wine
[4:17:03] <@PeachSaliva> Yes
[4:17:03] <Ipsenscastle> My cat smells like biscuits, but only when she's happy. I don't know why. She just exudes a happy smell
[4:17:07] <+Heart0fInk> brownPRIDE
[4:17:11] <Ipsenscastle> there's probably a gross reason
[4:17:17] <@PeachSaliva> Elmo smells like breakfast
[4:17:22] <+REDtheBEAST> Plague smells of fresh cut oak and a basket full of kittens
[4:17:28] <@PeachSaliva> Because he likes to stand way too close to the stove when I make breakfast
[4:17:30] <KellBeII> emlo is sweet
[4:17:31] <+Heart0fInk> My cats smell like dirt.
[4:17:31] <foulfoamz> no wonder he must eat his fur
[4:17:39] <arkv01> a lil bit of drool?
[4:17:43] <@PeachSaliva> He does!
[4:17:51] <zamzoph> using the stove for breakfast sounds like hard work
[4:17:52] <Ipsenscastle> See when I picture breakfast I'm thinking of a fry-up, that's probably wrong though
[4:17:55] <@PeachSaliva> Lol! Yeah sometimes he smells like pee
[4:17:58] <@PeachSaliva> But we clean him
[4:18:02] <Ipsenscastle> that'd be one greasy cat
[4:18:03] <+Scevda> Needs more strain around the eyes or mouth perhaps.
[4:18:04] <eyezehuhh> the amount of detail in this is amazing!
[4:18:07] <@PeachSaliva> No a fry up is correct
[4:18:09] <%KaiserMario> Show some gums and stick her tongue out a bit, that should do it
[4:18:11] <@PeachSaliva> That’s what I like to kake
[4:18:12] <Ipsenscastle> haha
[4:18:14] <+RoninRorinth> he's a cat doesn't he clean himself?
[4:18:14] <+REDtheBEAST> ah so clean pee smell
[4:18:23] <@PeachSaliva> Yeah what if her tongue was out
[4:18:29] <@PeachSaliva> Give her blep
[4:18:52] <@PeachSaliva> That’s true
[4:19:06] <@PeachSaliva> But Elmo does not clean himself well because he’s.. elmo
[4:19:16] <KellBeII> peepee boi \o/
[4:19:19] <foulfoamz> nasty pee pee cat
[4:19:23] <Ipsenscastle> Cleaning a cat's ass is traumatic for everybody
[4:19:27] <eyezehuhh> psaElmo
[4:19:27] <foulfoamz> but we love him
[4:19:28] <KellBeII> wonderful peepee cat
[4:19:28] <+REDtheBEAST> Elmo is filth incarnate
[4:19:31] <+RoninRorinth> elmo partied too hard as a kitten
[4:19:38] <@PeachSaliva> Nobody likes it when Elmo’s ass needs a cleanin
[4:19:44] <+YelloGek> Refraining from those purple magic-wafts she's leaves everywhere in her fight?
[4:19:52] <@PeachSaliva> Eli are you e begging
[4:19:55] <+Heart0fInk> I like money too. but too much
[4:20:07] <@PeachSaliva> Do we need to get you to a certain number of subs before you show us her vagana
[4:20:07] <+Urgoslav> He's not begging, he's telling us to simp
[4:20:36] <+RoninRorinth> plague opening a onlyfans account?
[4:20:39] <YakumoYomi> I will give money right now for furry vag. DIRTY money.
[4:20:43] <Ipsenscastle> If I had a Twitch, the sub alert would be the MyFreeCams jingle
[4:21:04] <@PeachSaliva> Haha ipsen that’s good
[4:21:12] <%caramello_man> plague needs one billion doll hairs to draw vagine
[4:21:19] <CalderGaming> man getting simped by football
[4:22:10] <+RoninRorinth> just have to deal with korean sports until the american ones come back calder
[4:22:11] <YakumoYomi> Segata Sanshiro is a gimmick that Sega sorely underutilized.
[4:23:00] <CalderGaming> it would have worked if they made the saturn more carefully Kappa
[4:23:11] <jettybandit> what is the name of this song?
[4:23:17] <@PeachSaliva> She looks magnificent
[4:23:17] <Emeralddragon2> Has plague commented on the new xcom snek waifu? I'm going to watch his old video with the xcom snek
[4:23:42] <sosuke5> Is it not "Do do do do"?
[4:24:03] <eyezehuhh> it's Sexy Dance
[4:24:31] <Presence_Eternal> If only there was a vast network of computers we could use to identify it.
[4:24:32] <Ipsenscastle> Doot doot doo do
[4:24:40] <jettybandit> @eyezehuhh Thanks much apperciated
