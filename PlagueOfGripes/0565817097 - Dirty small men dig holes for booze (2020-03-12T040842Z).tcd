[0:00:04] <StaceMcGate> I was gonna say, how many times are you going to beat the demo Plague?
[0:00:06] <%bettysharkface> Oh he back
[0:00:37] <%bettysharkface> I don't know what this game is
[0:01:07] <StaceMcGate> Killing Floor + Minecraft @bettysharkface
[0:01:14] <%Triblade1992> okay
[0:01:19] <%bettysharkface> Hm
[0:01:47] <Murphio_GS> Hey plague, I'mma tell you more about how amazing soup is here
[0:02:04] <StaceMcGate> @PlagueOfGripes have you been playing solo or coop?
[0:02:08] <%bettysharkface> Soup is bad, hot liquids in general are a mistake
[0:02:39] <%Triblade1992> are they all dwarves?
[0:02:41] <Murphio_GS> Very dwarf-like
[0:02:54] <ThatGuyThere03> I'm digging the hat
[0:02:56] <StaceMcGate> this game needs a female dwarf
[0:03:04] <laserbeaming> Dwarves need their beard, else they wither and die
[0:03:21] <laserbeaming> They need it to absorb nutrients from the earth
[0:03:22] <%Triblade1992> But where am I suppose to get my clothes from if Soup is bad?
[0:03:26] <cerazor01> Excuse me Soup is awesome.
[0:03:29] <Coystick> Space dwarf?
[0:03:47] <cerazor01> Dwarves eat Stone Soup. this is known.

[0:04:50] <Coystick> BullyofGripes
[0:05:06] <DesuDesuDokiDoki> DWARF BOIS LES GOO
[0:05:09] <ThatGuyThere03> Stew is filling
[0:05:10] <%SilverRoddo> plagueGripes_CL plagueGripes_CL plagueGripes_CL
[0:05:16] <%Triblade1992> but Soup gives us all the best clothes though Plague!
[0:05:16] <ThatGuyThere03> Soup gives the illusion of being full
[0:05:16] <+Grums_McGuff> Huh, this is not a game I would've expected Plague to play, but I ain't complaining
[0:05:18] <Coystick> Stew is thicc & chunky
[0:05:21] <cerazor01> I now regret bringing up that Soup.
[0:05:24] <filialpails> stew is thicc soup
[0:05:34] <%bettysharkface> @PlagueOfGripes Hot liquid is illegal and bad no matter what form you project on it
[0:05:37] <StaceMcGate> ROCK AND STONE
[0:05:56] <laserbeaming> Stew is superior
[0:06:02] <+sadiebubs> I just got the most meta twitch ad about a twitch streamer advertising a website for artists that make emotes
[0:06:19] <StaceMcGate> 4 and 5 are god awful
[0:06:36] <$Rshiners> soup is gross
[0:06:44] <filialpails> stew is a doing word
[0:06:45] <%Triblade1992> Soup gives us the best clothes though plague!
[0:06:45] <Tersalus> you keep your dirty mouth shut about my life sludge!!
[0:06:48] <Rata> "soup is not a lunch. soup is a condiment" - dril
[0:06:50] <%SilverRoddo> Soup is hot cereal.
[0:06:52] <ZecoraTheEnchantress> Oh boy space dorfs
[0:06:58] <laserbeaming> Soup reminds me of poverty
[0:07:04] <Tempmael> stew is chonky soup change my mind
[0:07:06] <laserbeaming> and how I don't want it again
[0:07:06] <%bettysharkface> Silly dorf, get outta there
[0:07:17] <Tersalus> my warm nutrient slurry is valid and deserves respect >(
[0:07:18] <Tiny_Axolotl> No idea what this is
[0:07:18] <DesuDesuDokiDoki> stew > soup

[0:07:22] <StaceMcGate> he couldn't live with the guilty anymore
[0:07:27] <cerazor01> he killed himself over you Soup opinions
[0:07:31] <%Triblade1992> i shop at Soup for all my clothing needs
[0:07:48] <DesuDesuDokiDoki> stew is both a liquid and a solid, like curry and poop
[0:07:52] <+vectorless_peon> that was my mom's opinion on soup too plague
[0:07:52] <laserbeaming> Is host migration as terrible as Warframe's?
[0:07:53] <Coystick> KICK THEM

[0:11:13] <+sadiebubs> This sounds like a Plauge of Gripes simulator Kappa
[0:11:13] <StaceMcGate> grab the dosh, bro down, scream rock and stone, and cash out
[0:11:17] <ahaegotrigger> hell yeah the Deep Rock
[0:11:17] <ThatGuyThere03> hey, somebody's gotta do it
[0:11:23] <xJesterxkingx> GUN drill
[0:11:24] <BeefyQueefer> So it's a 70s coal minder simulator game?
[0:11:48] <StaceMcGate> you have to harvest the stones while navigating a randomly generated map and fighting aliens
[0:12:03] <+sparkysparks_> aren't all of the character voices the same guy just at different pitches?
[0:12:04] <howimaginary> what's new plague
[0:12:06] <300coolfactsaboutbears> Yoooo, so happy people are giving this game more coverage.
[0:12:10] <StaceMcGate> fully destructible environment like red faction
[0:12:17] <+silvery_cricket> Do you feel the satisfaction of digging things and then putting things in a bucket
[0:12:21] <theloganbrand> You did.
[0:12:22] <DesuDesuDokiDoki> gooold
[0:12:38] <StaceMcGate> you also asked it for a good living playerbase
[0:12:42] <laserbeaming> I'm sure you said shooter
[0:12:42] <theloganbrand> Is Junkrat's VA in this game?
[0:13:05] <DesuDesuDokiDoki> LUL
[0:13:07] <Tiny_Axolotl> Play Divinity Original Sin 2 for nice co op
[0:13:29] <waterisnotabeverage> ever tried viscera cleanup detail?
[0:13:41] <+silvery_cricket> It is Left 4 Dead meets Terraria
[0:13:41] <+Urdunngurdunn> risk of rain 2 is also pretty good for Co op
[0:13:42] <$Skittlesoul> Kreygasm500 hey Plague really enjoyed your take on the cell saga. While I'm not a huge dragon ball fan I definetly remember watching it when I was younger
[0:13:56] <+sadiebubs> so does this game have classes?
[0:13:56] <godspeedspacebat> mjbS
[0:14:09] <BeefyQueefer> Yeah it does
[0:14:13] <%SilverRoddo> I feel like Big the Cat will appear in this cave.
[0:14:22] <+silvery_cricket> When is the Yu Yu Hakusho video
[0:14:24] <DesuDesuDokiDoki> yeah, same
[0:14:26] <shevan123> thats pretty universal
[0:14:30] <HelghastTroop> im not of a big fan of how much the difficulty spike between hazard 3 and 4 is
[0:14:36] <ThatGuyThere03> I feel especially repulsed by most DBZ content on YouTube for whatever reason
[0:14:39] <godspeedspacebat> @SilverRoddo not sure the rock galactic is deep enough
[0:14:40] <StaceMcGate> People try to forget the Great Saiyaman arc though
[0:14:44] <howimaginary> never watched dragon ball
[0:14:45] <+Pixel_Matt> Toonami after school was like everyday for me
[0:14:47] <%SilverRoddo> LUL
[0:14:52] <ThatGuyThere03> I never got the hate for great Saiyaman
[0:14:55] <theloganbrand> I think even if you hadn't seen db you can get what's going on if you've seen anything in the genre
[0:15:11] <coldarmracer> 2nd stream I have caught of yours this month. Are you a pro streamer now and not just a lewd artist?
[0:15:26] <%Triblade1992> I thought it was the Android Saga? Like the Android arc was the point when mecha freeza showed up to piccolo fusing. while the cell arc was the first appearance of Cell to trunks killing his Androids?
[0:15:31] <HelghastTroop> @ThatGuyThere03 its all because of how popualr dbz is and how many shit lords are fans of it
[0:15:46] <StaceMcGate> @PlagueOfGripes did you enjoy your time watching DB Super overall? I know your criticisms
[0:16:00] <ThatGuyThere03> are you referring to my comment about the Great Saiyaman or me shitting on DBZ YouTubers?

[0:16:58] <StaceMcGate> grappling hook is nice
[0:17:13] <Tersalus> ziplines become extremely useful on certain maps or mission types
[0:17:24] <HelghastTroop> in some maps haveing the zip line is real important to get the team to places
[0:17:27] <ThatGuyThere03> You ever try Terraria Plague?
[0:17:29] <srkAres> have you tried Vermintide 2, plague?
[0:17:33] <+Pixel_Matt> It's why I love Vermintide
[0:17:44] <Tersalus> have you tried video game, plague?
[0:17:48] <HelghastTroop> vermintide is actually preety sick
[0:17:54] <howimaginary> imagine pleague plays Minecraft
[0:18:00] <that_guy_from_high_school> Booty Boooty Rockin everywhere
[0:18:21] <that_guy_from_high_school> Ass Successfully tapped
[0:18:25] <HelghastTroop> i whole hardly accept that vermintide is my replacemeant for left 4 dead type of games
[0:18:26] <StaceMcGate> that was a quick ass mission
[0:18:46] <300coolfactsaboutbears> What is your favorite weapon in the game?
[0:18:50] <+silvery_cricket> This is what Star Trek Picard should of been
[0:18:58] <+silvery_cricket> 4 dwarfs in a mine

[0:20:24] <that_guy_from_high_school> no grappling hook?
[0:20:28] <300coolfactsaboutbears> Plague, Lord of the hole.
[0:20:28] <Tersalus> out of ziplines?
[0:20:29] <StaceMcGate> Castaway starring Eli as Winston
[0:20:33] <mydadworksatTwitch> Playing with randos?
[0:20:45] <%Triblade1992> This is why I don't like these games and prefer single players
[0:21:02] <HelghastTroop> you can play this game solo
[0:21:06] <StaceMcGate> Zipline!
[0:21:11] <300coolfactsaboutbears> He just restocked, he should have full ziplines.
[0:21:25] <%bettysharkface> Dead?
[0:21:31] <DesuDesuDokiDoki> LUL
[0:21:35] <Tersalus> we lose too many dwarves that way....
[0:21:59] <mydadworksatTwitch> Everyone youre playing with is new
[0:22:03] <glasphemy> Gone down eh? Those must be some happy small man
[0:22:09] <Tersalus> well those people are jerks
[0:22:09] <@dcn2049> those beards need work
[0:22:12] <glasphemy> men, it's early ok
[0:22:13] <mydadworksatTwitch> You need one vet
[0:22:14] <HelghastTroop> does plague have a discord channel?
[0:22:25] <@dcn2049> Nope
[0:22:30] <HelghastTroop> ah
[0:22:33] <orphancrippler_> plague would you ever stream farming simulator?
[0:22:35] <%bettysharkface> Dacon
[0:22:36] <glasphemy> Channel? That's very unambitious
[0:22:37] <Tersalus> tbh with the big updates and such lately, there are more new players, i.e. more people who dont understand it's a team game
[0:22:38] <StaceMcGate> Maybe their RPing as greedy ass corporate dwarves
[0:22:45] <%SilverRoddo> Tie a rope to the ship to yourself, so you can find your way back.
[0:22:47] <HelghastTroop> i wouldve suggest just play this game with people over discord
[0:22:49] <glasphemy> Technically it's not untrue
[0:22:50] <Tersalus> most people, esp. in higher play are decent folks
[0:23:06] <DesuDesuDokiDoki> dwarfs gonna dwarf
[0:23:23] <orphancrippler_> is there a medic class?
[0:23:42] <DesuDesuDokiDoki> @PlagueOfGripes have you tried to play with pat?

[0:24:01] <%glasphemy> You need friends who are bigger losers, plague
[0:24:31] <Tersalus> silly, drillers dont need to see!
[0:24:37] <%bettysharkface> Managed to play SS13 ok, and that game where we were tank people
[0:24:41] <stranger59> I just got here, is this a Fortnite?
[0:24:43] <StaceMcGate> This just reminds me of how great AVP 2 was back in the day
[0:25:02] <%glasphemy> I'm watching on 160p because my internet is a very narrow tube
[0:25:04] <DesuDesuDokiDoki> @RyuuAoi he just finished a re6 strem
[0:25:05] <Sapphire2300> to be fair with the new world generation, keeping a cavern lit is a royal pain
[0:25:11] <RyuuAoi> @stranger59 It's a Plaguenite Keepo
[0:25:31] <stranger59> @RyuuAoi Even better!
[0:25:40] <%Mr_y1096> was that hologram flossing?
[0:25:44] <RyuuAoi> @desudesudokidoki COWARD. Needs to commit. Play more video games!
[0:25:53] <ThereIsNoJustice> I mean your eyes would adjust in real life though that is not a justification for making the flamethrower a bit worse in a game...

[0:26:57] <Tersalus> press E on a grunt when they are close
[0:27:04] <Tersalus> they gotta be real close though

[0:31:45] <laserbeaming> uwu
[0:32:03] <DesuDesuDokiDoki> UwU
[0:32:11] <%glasphemy> I remember you saying it like it was only yesterday
[0:32:13] <ZecoraTheEnchantress> Survival of the fittest plague, which means abandoning team mates as soon as they go down, more resources for you after all
[0:32:23] <mydadworksatTwitch> Nah. The penalty is minor as long as someone makes it on the pod
[0:32:31] <midnightmadness32> Hello everybody !
[0:32:55] <StaceMcGate> Spoiler: he was nobody
[0:33:08] <%glasphemy> What happened to Eli?
[0:33:22] <DesuDesuDokiDoki> cool
[0:33:36] <midnightmadness32> What's going on, just got here.
[0:33:39] <ZeterZero > Who was Boss? Where was Boss? When was Boss? How was Boss? Why was Boss?
[0:34:14] <Coystick> Man Ground Zeroes was such a good game
[0:34:24] <DesuDesuDokiDoki> An imitation of the Boss, Imitating the Boss
[0:34:40] <%Triblade1992> "what should we name Naked Snake now that he killed The Boss?"
[0:34:50] <%Triblade1992> *scribbles Big in front of Boss*
[0:34:56] <%Triblade1992> "GASP!!!"
[0:34:58] <StaceMcGate> Skull Face was such a well developed villain huh?
[0:35:06] <DrFaustMD> Venom is a great character
[0:35:10] <%SilverRoddo> Burn bugs, their exoskeletons will contain the heat, and boil the insect juices within. CurseLit
[0:35:37] <CobaltPhoenix27> the proximity mine is the best
[0:35:49] <StaceMcGate> @PlagueOfGripes what role do you normally play as in coop games? Support, DPS, or Tank?
[0:36:01] <ZecoraTheEnchantress> I wish skullface didn't make me hate huey more.
[0:36:14] <DesuDesuDokiDoki> G U N
[0:36:26] <DrFaustMD> unironically I like skull face. his motivation is interesting
[0:36:31] <BrachyZoid> 38 raiders from BrachyZoid have joined!

[0:37:05] <BrachyZoid> The creators remember Gohan??
[0:37:06] <+silvery_cricket> History of martial arts
[0:37:15] <ZecoraTheEnchantress> His motivation and backstory were great, but his execution wasn't, which I can guess is cause of konamis handling at the time
[0:37:15] <+D1ABOL1K> Archeology?
[0:37:19] <ralanost> Better than Tien
[0:37:26] <Major_monotone> Hey Plague and chat! How are we doing today?
[0:37:28] <@dcn2049> animal mating rituals
[0:37:36] <theloganbrand> He has an arts degree in communication
[0:37:40] <%glasphemy> Ah, plague's field
[0:37:42] <%Triblade1992> No no @BrachyZoid you are thinking of Tiien
[0:37:45] <StaceMcGate> but Ziplines!
[0:38:00] <Tiny_Axolotl> Gohan big smart, big money!
[0:38:04] <DrFaustMD> that can be said about MGSV as a whole. when you dig deeper what's there is pretty great
[0:38:05] <%SilverRoddo> Hello, Monotone. We do it. LuvPeekR
[0:38:06] <zafooru> That scout is a spy!
[0:38:09] <mydadworksatTwitch> You can have 4 ziplines
[0:38:11] <CobaltPhoenix27> i'd say the ziplines shine in point extraction, in other mission types it's only good for chasms
[0:38:12] <ThereIsNoJustice> if you like to aim, scout has the best gun to unlock for his primary. It's an M1 garand futurized. Most fun wep in the game
[0:38:12] <%Skittlesoul> does gohan even need to worry about money? I though the whole family was just riding on the ox kings wealth
[0:38:18] <+silvery_cricket> I would like to think he studies the history of martial arts, like where styles and teachings originated
[0:38:57] <Major_monotone> Glad to hear it @silverroddo
[0:39:18] <CobaltPhoenix27> some extra weapons are sidegrades, others are downgrades
[0:39:39] <+silvery_cricket> drill fists
[0:39:40] <StaceMcGate> Call me crazy, but I think Plague is gonna get left behind again
[0:39:41] <$Rshiners> what do you think about goten is he just a non element
[0:40:01] <DesuDesuDokiDoki> beardless dwarves look like molemen
[0:40:04] <mydadworksatTwitch> Update 29 is going to rebalance the weapons. Scout has the best alternates currently
[0:40:13] <Tiny_Axolotl> Graphic design as in computer graphics?
[0:40:13] <$sleepy_coffee> The battle rifle for the scout is pretty ok, he becomes the long-mid trash killer who can pick at larger bugs
[0:40:15] <zafooru> Dwarves *are* molemen
[0:40:17] <300coolfactsaboutbears> I like his shitty dumpy body squeezed in a skintight suit.
[0:40:22] <zafooru> they're for real troglobites
[0:40:31] <%criticalinked> criticalinked subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 17 months, currently on a 9 month streak! I can‚Äôt stay to watch because I‚Äôve gotta get up for work in the morning, but this game looks pretty nifty.
[0:40:39] <+silvery_cricket> your 3ft tall and weight 500lbs
[0:40:43] <%Triblade1992> ah dark souls favorite friend: Gravity
[0:41:19] <zafooru> as you do, as dwarves
[0:41:46] <%glasphemy> Sounda amaaazing
[0:42:01] <%bettysharkface> Nice
[0:42:02] <StaceMcGate> ROCK AND STONE
[0:42:05] <DesuDesuDokiDoki> ROCK AND STONE
[0:42:06] <zafooru> Rock and STONE!
[0:42:06] <%Triblade1992> drunken Dwarves
[0:42:14] <Sapphire2300> ROCK AND STONE
[0:42:18] <ZeterZero > That was a longer rant than I realized.
[0:42:21] <CorrosiveFox> FOR KARL
[0:42:24] <+silvery_cricket> The intended way to play
[0:42:24] <CobaltPhoenix27> so your average dwarf
[0:42:26] <StaceMcGate> just like real life
[0:42:29] <DesuDesuDokiDoki> sounds lovely
[0:42:36] <zafooru> Having a dwarf button is a real boon to this game
[0:42:39] <+Ezguerila> worst mistake i did in this game was getting borderline blackout drunk and went to mission
[0:42:52] <+silvery_cricket> ROCK AND STONE
[0:43:00] <zafooru> he hEHHH ROCK AND STONE!
[0:43:22] <+silvery_cricket> It kinda sucks there is no warhammer class
[0:43:25] <+silvery_cricket> just mashing bugs
[0:43:34] <$sleepy_coffee> Ah the natural habitat of the dwarfs, being drunk belligerents screaming in holes
[0:44:03] <CobaltPhoenix27> with those you can only damage them from behind
[0:44:05] <StaceMcGate> The fact this game has 0 space Goblins is a true crime however
[0:44:21] <zafooru> THere's no space goblins???
[0:44:41] <zafooru> Where do the dwarves get their goblinite then?
[0:45:00] <+silvery_cricket> I wish you could find deranged abandoned Dwarves that got left behind that just are screaming and punching bugs
[0:45:26] <coldarmracer> banelings?
[0:45:35] <StaceMcGate> sploogelings
[0:45:38] <Sapphire2300> eyes the startch nut
[0:45:47] <mydadworksatTwitch> Scout is the selfish mobility class. Platforms ziplines and driller tunnels benefit everyone
[0:45:59] <CobaltPhoenix27> @silvery_cricket so a one in a thousand chance to run into Karl
[0:46:11] <%bettysharkface> Cock...and bone
[0:46:17] <%Triblade1992> Rock and Stone is the Dwarves version of "Are you feelin' it now Mr Krabs?"
[0:46:19] <+silvery_cricket> Yes
[0:46:21] <zafooru> "cockmongler"
[0:46:25] <@dcn2049> Do it
[0:46:30] <StaceMcGate> a cockmongler expression, ah yes
[0:46:35] <+silvery_cricket> Gotta give him booze to restore his sanity
[0:46:42] <oniwahoo> I don't even know what that means
[0:46:42] <stranger59> cockmongler takes me back
[0:46:43] <ToeBeanHeaven> Always knew plague was a dorf
[0:46:45] <DesuDesuDokiDoki> LUL
[0:46:49] <ZeterZero > A solemn nod speaks volumes sometimes.
[0:46:53] <CobaltPhoenix27> mini mules are having a seizure
[0:46:57] <%SilverRoddo> Metapods?
[0:46:58] <zafooru> The robots are screaming to emulate their dwarven overlords
[0:47:07] <%bettysharkface> Plague is dorf, chat is goblins
[0:47:12] <CobaltPhoenix27> LUL
[0:47:12] <+silvery_cricket> ROCK AND STONE
[0:47:16] <+cloud9yang> ayy
[0:47:19] <%Mr_y1096> Someone‚Äôs fuckin walee
[0:47:21] <%Triblade1992> look at all the flashing lights though Plague!
[0:47:30] <+Ezguerila> resupply pods are magical creatures
[0:47:36] <$sleepy_coffee> Amazing
[0:47:37] <StaceMcGate> inb4 Plague gets left behind...
[0:48:03] <+silvery_cricket> This game would suck if you were humans
[0:48:13] <+silvery_cricket> Like it had to be dwarves
[0:48:39] <oniwahoo> Seems like a fool
[0:48:41] <%Triblade1992> because co ops can really suck
[0:48:42] <StaceMcGate> Pat would disapprove of this Zipline placement
[0:48:44] <zafooru> my only interest in this game is its dwarven charm
[0:49:01] <+silvery_cricket> Imagine if this was 4 filthy elves in a mine
[0:49:03] <CobaltPhoenix27> once you fix all the small mules, you call for extraction like normal, but then you gotta fix a machine and stand near it for a while, repeat once more and then wait a few minutes for the pod to open
[0:49:13] <%SilverRoddo> Real talk, people‚Äôs ankles will shatter, roll or sprain in this environment.
[0:49:20] <ZeterZero > Four filthy orcs
[0:49:31] <zafooru> Dwarves are strong against bugs, but much like elephants they are weak to fall damage
[0:49:32] <JINcredible1> sometimes it works
[0:49:46] <%Triblade1992> flashing lights plague! FLASHING LIGHTS! They have to look pretty
[0:49:52] <%Samex_Comex> So it's a game where you dig?
[0:49:57] <zafooru> and shoot bug
[0:50:04] <zafooru> and yell and scream and drink
[0:50:05] <CobaltPhoenix27> someone called for extraction like in a normal mission
[0:50:16] <%Samex_Comex> I like digging
[0:50:17] <oniwahoo> diggy diggy hole?
[0:50:27] <+silvery_cricket> ROCK AND STONE
[0:50:34] <zafooru> ROCK AND STONE TO THE BONE!
[0:50:42] <Aragest> Didnt even think about host connections
[0:51:24] <DesuDesuDokiDoki> ROCK... AND STONE!
[0:51:31] <@Nightbot> Plague is a youtube animator and also streams at https://picarto.tv/Plague . Also: t-shirts! http://goo.gl/lze8QO
[0:51:31] <%Triblade1992> Got to keep the young people diistracted with the pretty lights
[0:51:32] <CobaltPhoenix27> ah yes the magic of exploding guts
[0:52:14] <+Ezguerila> it's all fine and dandy until bulk detonator is behind you
[0:52:21] <CobaltPhoenix27> but they're buggos it's what they do
[0:52:27] <@dcn2049> crawling on ceilings was my favorite part of AvP PvP
[0:52:37] <oniwahoo> knocking all those nuts loose
[0:52:40] <StaceMcGate> AvP multiplayer was the best
[0:53:06] <%SilverRoddo> We need that Dakka tech.
[0:53:10] <StaceMcGate> even if Predators were widely unbalanced
[0:53:14] <ZeterZero > They pack them with extra parts so activating isnt about putting screws and bolts in, but taking them out.
[0:53:46] <%Triblade1992> this looks like a clusterfuck of imagery
[0:53:58] <ralanost> Suspended tea bagging teammates
[0:54:25] <mydadworksatTwitch> Drop shields for your teammates
[0:54:43] <%glasphemy> Give em the goods ;)
[0:54:59] <%Triblade1992> healing bullets do negative damage
[0:54:59] <%SilverRoddo> Git gudz
[0:55:00] <zafooru> It's a dwarven massage
[0:55:14] <%KellBeII> < 3
[0:55:34] <%Samex_Comex> Oh shit they are Sky commanders!
[0:55:55] <%SilverRoddo> What, Evillak!?
[0:56:02] <oniwahoo> Healing bullets reminds me of the coop campaigns from Resistance 2
[0:56:13] <StaceMcGate> holy shit, Plague wasn't left behind!
[0:56:35] <%KellBeII> so hows deep rock?
[0:56:42] <DatGreyMind> I've been wondering how this game is.
[0:57:11] <xeros720> like animal crossing
[0:57:13] <Tampaoster> So its the dark souls of dwarven mining
[0:57:18] <laserbeaming> Deep Shamrock plagueGripes_CL
[0:57:22] <DatGreyMind> Kappa
[0:57:27] <%Triblade1992> "I sure do luv muuh gun! Just as much as I love the 2nd Amendment and "MERIICA!" - Plague
[0:57:27] <%SilverRoddo> Yes.
[0:57:55] <StaceMcGate> but Do Combo
[0:57:55] <ThereIsNoJustice> haz 5 is the dark souls
[0:57:58] <oniwahoo> People who want to be annoyed and relaxed sounds like a niche market
[0:57:59] <Coystick> Cumbo>Numbo
[0:58:00] <omg_its_tim> Seen this on sale through steam and got it. Love it now though.
[0:58:01] <+Ezguerila> steeve!
[0:58:01] <JINcredible1> STEEVE
[0:58:11] <JINcredible1> it works
[0:58:13] <$sleepy_coffee> Lorge damage
[0:58:28] <DesuDesuDokiDoki> me
[0:58:29] <ThereIsNoJustice> plague I literally saw you use the pet thing
[0:58:34] <ThereIsNoJustice> and it worked
[0:58:36] <mydadworksatTwitch> We saw you use it while trying to revive soneone
[0:58:38] <JINcredible1> karl is a dwarf who probably died and was a cool dude
[0:58:38] <acehigh223> dwarf hero
[0:58:39] <%glasphemy> They must be swedish
[0:58:51] <+slavsquatcho> dwarf that was really good at his job
[0:58:58] <JINcredible1> drank some beer, tried to fight a dreadnaught with a pickaxe
[0:59:02] <acehigh223> he mined all the rock and stone
[0:59:03] <wofguy> Karl is a dwarf
[0:59:07] <StaceMcGate> from the wiki @PlagueOfGripes Karl is the Dwarf who directs your crew throughout missions, and is your only link to Deep Rock Galactic's (DRG's) HQ; they call this out because they're completing these tasks for him. The existence of the voice line "That guy at mission control; he really has a cozy job!" refutes this, however.
[0:59:09] <%Samex_Comex> The guy from ATHF?
[0:59:09] <Murphio_GS> Talking about Karl marx
[0:59:14] <JINcredible1> thats not karl
[0:59:17] <Murphio_GS> "For KARL"
[0:59:24] <JINcredible1> karl isnt mission control
[0:59:32] <%Triblade1992> Karl is, as of Update 18 "Job Opportunities," a Dwarf (presumably) who has yet to appear in game. He is commonly referenced to by the other Dwarves when using the Salute command in game.
[0:59:33] <sosuke5> If not for karl, who else?
[0:59:50] <ThereIsNoJustice> yeah the mission control guy seems like a human and not a dwarf
[0:59:52] <%KellBeII> wow you landed on an entire faamily
[0:59:56] <DesuDesuDokiDoki> bugs
[0:59:59] <%KellBeII> probably crushed their children
[1:00:02] <laserbeaming> So... I guess no one knows who's Karl then
[1:00:10] <DesuDesuDokiDoki> they hongry
[1:00:18] <+Ashboldt> I mean... you landed on them.
[1:00:20] <StaceMcGate> The real Karl was inside us all along
[1:00:26] <Murphio_GS> Your in their nests
[1:00:29] <bearalin> They are in the way, that‚Äôs what they are.
[1:00:37] <oniwahoo> they're the Rachni, pretty sure
[1:00:41] <%Triblade1992> It says Karl hasn't shown up physically yet @laserbeaming
[1:00:43] <@dcn2049> You probably smell bad
[1:00:44] <mydadworksatTwitch> You have beastmaster. Use it at point boank on the next grunt. E.
[1:00:53] <Murphio_GS> Those drills are cool
[1:01:00] <DesuDesuDokiDoki> LUL
[1:01:14] <Murphio_GS> *Clips through wall to fuck with you*
[1:01:25] <%KellBeII> those things look annoying but atleast you get to burn them
[1:01:36] <DatGreyMind> Givin em the healing blue milk
[1:01:42] <ohyouwouldntbelieveme> pouring one out
[1:01:45] <oniwahoo> In a wave at least it's a fight, one at a time is just an annoyance
[1:01:56] <%SilverRoddo> Pour some sugar on me.
[1:02:17] <@dcn2049> it's fine
[1:02:21] <laserbeaming> It is pretty gross
[1:02:25] <stranger59> icky pooey
[1:02:37] <%SilverRoddo> RPGMana RPGMana plagueGripes
[1:02:52] <DesuDesuDokiDoki> S T I C K Y
[1:02:56] <DraxTD> *tunes in to @PlagueOfGripes stream to see plague digging in a gooie hole of unknown things* ... yeah this seems right for Plague
[1:02:59] <laserbeaming> So... Monster Hunter Egg Hunt?
[1:03:03] <%Samex_Comex> Rock herpes, rokpes
[1:03:05] <JINcredible1> you can pet lootbugs
[1:03:17] <+Ezguerila> "I killed a lootbug and i'm not proud of it2
[1:03:22] <laserbeaming> that-s cute
[1:03:25] <@dcn2049> KILL
[1:03:29] <DesuDesuDokiDoki> KILL
[1:03:49] <AncelDeLambert> shoot it
[1:03:51] <DesuDesuDokiDoki> cool
[1:03:53] <AncelDeLambert> shOOOOOOT
[1:04:00] <AncelDeLambert> it's a giant maggot, kill
[1:04:27] <Murphio_GS> Mines in general are pretty bad
[1:04:33] <laserbeaming> Working on Coal Mines is basically a death sentence
[1:04:44] <Murphio_GS> avoid holes in the ground is sound advice
[1:05:01] <AncelDeLambert> I wish mineral veins would get mined in discreet chunks, I hate aiming at 0.5 parts of gold that's a tiny blip on the wall
[1:05:30] <%Mr_y1096> Sweet,sweet snickers
[1:05:38] <LuxCelestia> You have drills!
[1:05:52] <DesuDesuDokiDoki> F
[1:06:09] <AncelDeLambert> oh, can you drill up the gunk on the floor? I never know how to deal with it
[1:06:13] <oniwahoo> That escalated quickly
[1:06:17] <@dcn2049> drink the purple goop
[1:06:50] <+Grums_McGuff> You can drill/dig away the gunk, yeah, but it's so impractical to do that it's not worth it imo
[1:06:57] <laserbeaming> dwarves love their purple goop
[1:06:58] <DesuDesuDokiDoki> gg
[1:07:11] <DatGreyMind> They explode in a satisfying and gooey fashion
[1:07:19] <AncelDeLambert> oh god, big boom bug!
[1:07:20] <AncelDeLambert> RUN
[1:07:37] <AncelDeLambert> had a mission where three of these assholes spawned at once... during extraction
[1:07:38] <+Ezguerila> Bulk detonator is a good boy
[1:07:52] <DatGreyMind> What a lumpy lad
[1:08:17] <AncelDeLambert> makes me wish I had friends who played this game
[1:08:34] <AncelDeLambert> being able to actually TALK to your fellow dwarves and make plans would help
[1:08:59] <AncelDeLambert> "trust"?
[1:09:12] <mydadworksatTwitch> Haz 2 players theyre new and more confused than you
[1:09:15] <srkAres> true for probably all co-op l4d style games
[1:09:20] <DatGreyMind> i wish my days were filled with space dorf mining
[1:09:22] <bearalin> That thing was really focused on your corpse
[1:09:23] <AncelDeLambert> oh god, no-one tell Quiet Shy about this game, the friendly fire would never end
[1:09:47] <%Samex_Comex> Well today at work I took out trash
[1:10:05] <cerazor01> Do you think Universe 7 has the power of stuffed crust?
[1:10:06] <xeros720> just yell "ROCK AND STONE" at pat until he loads up the game
[1:10:12] <%Triblade1992> But Plague, how will the brick wall of a """"Character""""" learn to work with his power ranger buddies from now on?
[1:10:40] <cerazor01> Plague what do you think of the new TFS content quality wise?
[1:11:08] <+Ezguerila> they heal and buff other glyphids
[1:12:22] <%bettysharkface> LUL
[1:12:27] <DesuDesuDokiDoki> LUL

[1:19:21] <ThereIsNoJustice> isn't drill up stupid the gurren lagan thing
[1:19:39] <Murphio_GS> Ready to collect the bug flesh to make a soup out of it?
[1:19:46] <lloyddboy> i legit thought plague was gonna get squished by he supply pod like pat did
[1:19:48] <ralanost> gurren lagen is more "drill to the heavens"
[1:19:52] <Murphio_GS> as we all know, Plague just loves soups
[1:20:42] <+ATorL> Terribly rude of them.
[1:20:58] <%bettysharkface> Nice

[1:27:03] <%glasphemy> Vegeta what does it say about his rank It's just giving me a NAN error
[1:27:10] <oniwahoo> Not even 4 million? Jeez what's the point if you aren't going to commit
[1:27:25] <Sokumotanaka> No
[1:27:27] <+Ezguerila> sssshhhhh don't think about it
[1:27:30] <%glasphemy> ghost farts
[1:27:33] <lloyddboy> microfissures
[1:27:34] <stranger59> Wind cave... it happens.
[1:27:35] <lloyddboy> i dunno
[1:27:37] <%bettysharkface> Ye it's ghost farts
[1:27:39] <%Triblade1992> What Glasphemy said
[1:27:48] <ThereIsNoJustice> cold bug doing cold bug farts
[1:27:54] <%Triblade1992> it's canon now: it's ghost farts
[1:27:56] <lloyddboy> it does
[1:27:58] <Murphio_GS> Have you ever been in a cave plague?
[1:28:03] <lloyddboy> but only at extreme range
[1:28:07] <+Ezguerila> it has small drop off
[1:28:11] <Murphio_GS> It's fucking breezy even in stagnant places
[1:28:42] <%glasphemy> the one cave
[1:28:54] <+sadiebubs> are you streaming from a cave?
[1:28:57] <@dcn2049> It's a pressure system thing; the cave will equalize pressure with the surface if/when it changes, and it forces air out in the process
[1:29:05] <Murphio_GS> I keep hearing mammoth cave at everywhere
[1:29:11] <%bettysharkface> Pretty sure it's ghost farts Dacon
[1:29:20] <lloyddboy> also you came in through a fuckhuge hole you drilled in the ceiling, that could explain the wind
[1:29:26] <Murphio_GS> I'm now thoroughly convinced every state has a "mammoth cave"
[1:29:28] <@dcn2049> science kills ghosts
[1:29:41] <%bettysharkface> Ye that's how they became ghosts
[1:30:01] <@dcn2049> Killing ghosts makes ghosts?
[1:30:04] <%bettysharkface> Ye
[1:30:12] <+Ezguerila> green thingys spawn platforms
[1:30:18] <%bettysharkface> It's why they're hard to find
[1:30:23] <@dcn2049> ah
[1:31:03] <DesuDesuDokiDoki> LUL
[1:31:15] <lloyddboy> LUL
[1:31:17] <Coystick> Leave cute bug ALONE

[1:32:30] <DatGreyMind> This game has a very... distinct look to it
[1:32:34] <Murphio_GS> Okay yeah there's a cave in oregon that's unofficially called mammoth cave and one in california also called mammoth cave
[1:32:42] <@dcn2049> that rock looked like a giant ball of shit
[1:32:45] <DatGreyMind> But which one has the mammoth?
[1:32:53] <Murphio_GS> what's with the obsession with calling caves "mammoth"?
[1:32:54] <%Samex_Comex> I want that looty booty!
[1:32:56] <+Ezguerila> NO TOUCH! only watch
[1:33:04] <lloyddboy> the mammoth has several vacation homes
[1:33:05] <Coystick> Huge cutebug, feed cutebug, slip dollar bill between cutebug's cheeks.
[1:33:08] <DesuDesuDokiDoki> thicc loot buggy sacc
[1:33:23] <%bettysharkface> Heartbeat
[1:33:24] <+notEisiger> shoot every icicle, but only when other dwarfs are under them
[1:33:25] <%bettysharkface> Ye
[1:33:30] <Doomstar16> It sounds like a laser blast from an nes game.
[1:33:43] <lloyddboy> Beatty Offey's recipe book
[1:33:53] <Coystick> gentle pulsing noises remind us of the WOMB
[1:33:56] <+Ezguerila> those take 2 so one more

[1:34:38] <DesuDesuDokiDoki> fill that slutty hole
[1:34:55] <$Captain_Krunk> Thankfully, you are the scout. You make the best of everyones' sight :)
[1:34:55] <lloyddboy> @notEisiger why is every overclock for subata shit except for full auto
[1:34:58] <+notEisiger> you might hear the chirp, but it will also cause the soil to glow if they're buried
[1:34:59] <Coystick> These set levels or procedural gen'd?
[1:35:01] <%bettysharkface> Map reminds me of a movie...Alien?
[1:35:24] <Coystick> Oh no less cute bugs
[1:35:28] <%bettysharkface> I like their mouths though
[1:35:35] <+notEisiger> @lloyddboy because mini flechetts and tranq mods are cancer
[1:35:37] <%bettysharkface> Chompy
[1:35:43] <+Ezguerila> repair
[1:36:01] <+notEisiger> yeah dude stalacmites
[1:36:10] <lloyddboy> THEY'RE COMING OUTTA THE GODDAMN WALLS
[1:36:15] <%Samex_Comex> Starship troopers
[1:36:25] <%bettysharkface> Yeah the wall crawling is very familiar
[1:36:38] <+notEisiger> don't forget to touch the box: you need it's paint
[1:36:42] <Coystick> That image right there of the aliens clogged in the tunnel coming at you is the whole reason this game got made, that's there pitch
[1:36:49] <Coystick> That's rad
[1:36:50] <DesuDesuDokiDoki> ROCK AND STONE

[1:37:23] <%Samex_Comex> One rocks the other is stoned
[1:37:36] <ThereIsNoJustice> I bet a dwarf knows the difference between rock and stone
[1:37:37] <Futurecity10> Rock walls and stone walls are different
[1:37:48] <%bettysharkface> Ghost farts
[1:37:48] <+notEisiger> but seriously, you need to press Use on the thing you got the battery for if you want your loot
[1:37:51] <$Captain_Krunk> Yep.....also rains here
[1:37:54] <%Triblade1992> ghost farts
[1:38:25] <DesuDesuDokiDoki> just cause!
[1:38:56] <$Captain_Krunk> Oh wait until you see how cave leeches work here :)
[1:38:56] <lloyddboy> Kappa
[1:38:57] <+notEisiger> ghosts
[1:39:01] <@dcn2049> that's what they;'re calling the wind
[1:39:03] <@dcn2049> ghost fats
[1:39:05] <%glasphemy> we talking about ghosts?
[1:39:12] <%Triblade1992> the wind you were talking about and askinig where it came from we are calling "ghost farts"
[1:39:16] <+Ezguerila> well there is one hazard named haunted
[1:39:17] <$Captain_Krunk> They don't use gravity to catch with their tentacles btw :P
[1:39:22] <%bettysharkface> Dorfs using that Orc tech, if you believe in the grappling hook enough, it works, probably.
[1:39:37] <lloyddboy> nice, crate AND event
[1:39:40] <%Samex_Comex> Gooold!
[1:39:48] <%bettysharkface> Nooooo

[1:39:58] <Coystick> Loooty nooooooo
[1:40:00] <@dcn2049> All the touchys
[1:40:01] <+notEisiger> they shouldnt have eaten minerals
[1:40:19] <+Ezguerila> Loot bugs file a restraining order at you
[1:40:30] <%Samex_Comex> He really likes mining
[1:40:40] <DesuDesuDokiDoki> F
[1:40:51] <+notEisiger> make your driller dig towards the main cave
[1:40:59] <+Ezguerila> he is in ice hell
[1:41:09] <%bettysharkface> Time for everyone to get trapped in the ravine
[1:41:41] <+notEisiger> I havent ice skated in 24 years
[1:41:57] <+notEisiger> I tripped on ice 5 years ago though
[1:42:53] <+TroyMSW> I just got here. Is the event bugged? That big rock with the lasers should have a health bar
[1:43:02] <+TroyMSW> Oh there it is
[1:43:34] <+notEisiger> there's also an Eco Liberation Force
[1:43:37] <cerazor01> Nanite Bong Dispenser?
[1:43:40] <DesuDesuDokiDoki> flare
[1:44:06] <lloyddboy> A BOMB
[1:44:24] <lloyddboy> Hi-Ho!
[1:44:46] <+notEisiger> JC
[1:44:48] <DesuDesuDokiDoki> throw the bomb
[1:44:53] <@dcn2049> It's a bomb, plague
[1:45:17] <+notEisiger> Streamer Tax
[1:45:34] <+notEisiger> Plague, you still need to grab the skin from that battery box.
[1:45:37] <+Ezguerila> saddest thing about the steeve is that you can pet it even when it's dead
[1:45:46] <+TroyMSW> Only for promoted dwarves. You Driller is greedy boy. You still get bonus experience though
[1:46:09] <+Ezguerila> and gold
[1:46:21] <lloyddboy> you can
[1:46:33] <+Ezguerila> battery box was way before
[1:46:33] <+notEisiger> dont question me
[1:46:40] <%bettysharkface> Something sounds like a cat
[1:46:51] <+notEisiger> wrong box
[1:46:58] <lloyddboy> the other thing
[1:47:05] <+WhaleOfACod> that's either a cave leech or a flare lol
[1:47:07] <lloyddboy> where you put the beeping things in
[1:47:19] <+WhaleOfACod> You need to put a blank matrix core in there
[1:47:24] <@dcn2049> the box you got the hearty beepy batteries for
[1:47:47] <%bettysharkface> Lootbug haunts you for your sins
[1:47:48] <+Ezguerila> pretty much at the start of the mission was the battery box
[1:47:48] <foreverN2dust> you can have a little control
[1:47:51] <foreverN2dust> as a treat
[1:48:35] <lloyddboy> they cancel out
[1:48:40] <+notEisiger> wish it made steam
[1:48:45] <$SGrim> When you combine fire and ice, you get a song
[1:48:50] <%Triblade1992> 4 good seasons of a show and then 4 bad ones
[1:48:57] <@dcn2049> the ones that made a noise you liked
[1:49:02] <@dcn2049> when you started this mission
[1:49:13] <$SGrim> @Triblade1992 same page joke, sick DatSheffy
[1:49:15] <lloyddboy> NICE
[1:49:17] <+notEisiger> you got a good one
[1:49:22] <+notEisiger> wow, lootboxes
[1:49:40] <+Ezguerila> you took their treasure
[1:49:47] <+TroyMSW> What difficulty are you on?
[1:49:49] <+notEisiger> just FYI: the longer you stay in this mission type, the more frequent they spawn
[1:49:50] <$SGrim> @PlagueOfGripes play driller and just live in the walls.
[1:49:59] <+TroyMSW> Most people start on hazard 2
[1:50:20] <%glasphemy> did he just say "can somebody give me a bloody handjob?"
[1:50:48] <+notEisiger> hand 'ere
[1:50:50] <AncelDeLambert> I'm trying to get Hazard 5 unlocked, but my internet sucks so nerts
[1:50:59] <+notEisiger> fuck fossils FBBlock
[1:51:18] <+WhaleOfACod> agreed

[1:51:30] <+TroyMSW> Elite deep dives in this game are nuts. I don't recommend trying it without people you can talk to.
[1:51:33] <lloyddboy> LUL
[1:51:36] <+notEisiger> sick
[1:51:50] <%bettysharkface> Lootbug escaped?
[1:51:51] <+MajorDub> MajorDub subscribed with Twitch Prime. 
[1:51:54] <+Ezguerila> Glyphid ice skating ring
[1:51:57] <heytakeiteasyterry> digging holes for booze
[1:52:01] <+WaywardSera> Oh no it's my recurring nightmare where I'm trapped inside a hole that's filled with hungry spiders! WutFace
[1:52:24] <%Ezguerila> Ezguerila subscribed with Twitch Prime. They've subscribed for 22 months! plagueFace
[1:52:52] <+notEisiger> welcome to deep hole
[1:53:02] <%MajorDub> the deepest
[1:53:35] <%Ezguerila> I played only once with random ppls and they were the worst took all the resupplies
[1:53:40] <+notEisiger> dont forget the blizzard
[1:53:49] <%Triblade1992> and the ghost farts
[1:54:05] <%maledictus_faust> dwarves are very calorie dense.
[1:54:08] <+WaywardSera> The only way to sustain combat of this skill is a similarly powerful libido to keep the species going
[1:54:10] <%maledictus_faust> like butter
[1:54:11] <+WaywardSera> scale*
[1:54:13] <%MajorDub> i mean, what else would they evolve for?
[1:54:19] <$Valdorick> I mean, I do imagine Dwarves would be high in nutrition.
[1:54:29] <+notEisiger> have you seen the planet surface? you cracked it via Dead Space means, and you basically walked into a star-sized bee hive you kicked
[1:54:41] <+LordSDB> Cool to see plague stylin while shooting
[1:54:50] <%MajorDub> that actually is a terrifying thought
[1:55:07] <%Samex_Comex> Yummy plump dwarves
[1:55:11] <+notEisiger> engineer and driller can get higher up, if they have the brain capacity
[1:55:19] <lloyddboy> F
[1:55:22] <DesuDesuDokiDoki> YEYEYE
[1:55:23] <%Triblade1992> F
[1:55:24] <+notEisiger> FLEE

[1:55:27] <$SGrim> Crash mash LuL
[1:55:28] <+WaywardSera> dem bugs be lagging
[1:55:40] <tigerd23> HahaSweat
[1:55:53] <lloyddboy> plague you got em all
[1:55:55] <ZeterZero > Missed opportunity to have a Gandalf and Snow White themed characters as npcs.
[1:56:00] <lloyddboy> just put it in the machinwe
[1:56:04] <%Ezguerila> probably in a cave somewhere
[1:56:10] <LuxCelestia> Plague you have the last fossil
[1:56:12] <+TroyMSW> You have one on you
[1:56:20] <+notEisiger> unload it in the escape pod :^)
[1:56:21] <+TroyMSW> You can unload it on the pod. It has spots
[1:56:26] <lloyddboy> you can
[1:56:28] <%Ezguerila> you actually have the last fossil
[1:56:29] <+WhaleOfACod> He can deposit it on the side of the pod
[1:56:33] <+TroyMSW> The sides of the drop pod have deposit slots
[1:56:39] <+WaywardSera> nya~
[1:56:56] <+WaywardSera> they do meow, the fuck?
[1:57:21] <lloyddboy> you can always deposit on the side of the drop pod
[1:57:46] <+notEisiger> It's basically an instant freeze, and they shatter if they take enough damage
[1:57:48] <%Ezguerila> frozen enemies take tons of damage
[1:57:52] <+WhaleOfACod> Frozen enemies take twice as much damage
[1:58:23] <%Ezguerila> you have the last fossil
[1:58:24] <LuxCelestia> You HAVE the last fossil!
[1:58:33] <+notEisiger> YOU HAVE IT
[1:59:17] <%Triblade1992> LOL
[1:59:19] <+WhaleOfACod> Someone else had one too lol
[1:59:30] <%Triblade1992> That's some. Xenomorph shiit
[1:59:32] <+WaywardSera> It followed me home. Can I keep it?
[1:59:35] <%MajorDub> so it's like that futurama episode
[1:59:39] <@dcn2049> worm-beards
[1:59:59] <LixFury> yup
[1:59:59] <$SGrim> @PlagueOfGripes yes
[2:00:08] <$SGrim> the first one
[2:00:10] <$SGrim> yes
[2:00:15] <LuxCelestia> Thank goodness it's not that bureocratic
[2:00:20] <+WhaleOfACod> Side objectives don't but crafting materials and gold do
[2:00:55] <+TroyMSW> It just stops all vertical momentum.
[2:01:14] <+WhaleOfACod> I miss the double jump
[2:01:43] <+TroyMSW> Me too. But, to be fair, it was too damn good.
[2:01:55] <+WhaleOfACod> Yeah true
[2:01:56] <+s0ki_> I like playing as Driller .
[2:01:57] <+notEisiger> How do you feel about driller, also DRILLER LYFE
[2:01:57] <DesuDesuDokiDoki> ROCK AND STONE
[2:02:06] <+notEisiger> @s0ki_ my lad
[2:02:14] <Flamethrowerman09> Does drinking give you buffs?
[2:02:15] <+logoth_> Turn on the jukebox
[2:02:17] <lloyddboy> it gives you as many beers as there are players
[2:02:24] <+TroyMSW> RIP for the exploder infestation
[2:02:26] <+WhaleOfACod> Driller is love driller is life
[2:02:35] <+WhaleOfACod> @flamethrowerman09 certain beer does
[2:02:50] <AncelDeLambert> but I have a robot to be the scout
[2:02:56] <%Ezguerila> I like it how you need to pay almost 10K to have Jaundice
[2:03:34] <JonnyJug> Tried out the freeze ray for Driller?
[2:03:35] <lloyddboy> oh boy wait until you get engi's second tier weapons
[2:03:41] <lloyddboy> they're hot garbage
[2:03:46] <+notEisiger> do you know how hard it is for a dwarf to get liver failure
[2:03:52] <+WhaleOfACod> ...wut
[2:04:06] <%MajorDub> is dwarf liver failure a thing?
[2:04:19] <+TroyMSW> Gunner is very useful. Shields and bullets and ziplines
[2:04:28] <+notEisiger> can a dwarf drink too much to get it
[2:04:40] <+TroyMSW> Everyone I talk to seems to rank the 4 characters differently. It's interesting.
[2:04:58] <%MajorDub> i thought their biology is made of 70% liquor instead of water
[2:04:59] <%Ezguerila> it's a skin color you can buy
[2:05:03] <lloyddboy> driller is killer but gunner is funner
[2:05:26] <+notEisiger> I'm biased because my flamethrower can shoot 50meters
[2:05:54] <Huntercd> !uptime
[2:05:55] <@Nightbot> 2 hours 6 minutes 3 seconds
[2:06:01] <+notEisiger> like throwing a ziplock bag into the can?
[2:06:01] <+Shaggnar> Like power shit?
[2:06:08] <stranger59> What if EVERYTHING was farts?
[2:06:13] <whittacre> just get a colostomy bag installed
[2:06:15] <@dcn2049> poop eggs
[2:06:16] <lloyddboy> pissing but it's a magical girl transformation
[2:06:17] <General_Terro> LUL
[2:06:25] <doggieo> Thats horrific
[2:06:25] <+s0ki_> Errrr, What?
[2:06:28] <+logoth_> Im not touching doo doo fruit
[2:06:29] <+FunkyRot> why no
[2:06:29] <FstSergeant8595> flush the toilet while you pee. min max the time
[2:06:30] <%MajorDub> sounds like that'd clog your pores something terrible
[2:06:33] <Dao_Puppy> Aren't there worms that are 100% effecient so that they never poo. They can only eat acid but it might be worth it.
[2:06:34] <+FunkyRot> god why
[2:06:43] <tigerd23> fishySIP
[2:06:48] <%MajorDub> also sweating would produce the WORST smell
[2:06:53] <Huntercd> Koalas do that don't they?
[2:06:54] <+notEisiger> it's the yellow gusher
[2:07:01] <%Ezguerila> those explode too
[2:07:16] <@dcn2049> sand worm
[2:07:29] <Vemok> Fruimaybe not but some kinda pod hell yes
[2:07:45] <$Valdorick> "Walls have no meaning to me"
[2:08:09] <FstSergeant8595> walls are meerly a consideration
[2:08:50] <+notEisiger> Higher hazard usually means full upgrades and an actual plan.
[2:09:25] <+BuriasDempsey> Just got here, how's Deep rock galactic been?
[2:09:51] <+TheDoctor19901> is plague sad he cant play as a catgirl
[2:09:58] <+notEisiger> last mission was a hot mess
[2:10:40] <%Ezguerila> theres a bitter gem in the wall
[2:10:48] <Futurecity10> is it just me or did that plague voice active your fight or flight
[2:11:03] <Futurecity10> I didnt know plague could make that voice
[2:11:06] <lloyddboy> WE'RE RICH
[2:11:10] <+notEisiger> nab'd
[2:11:13] <+BuriasDempsey> That's completely normal reaction
[2:11:19] <@Nightbot> @RandyMarshUSA -> Sometimes I even amaze myself. [stop spamming emotes] [warning]
[2:11:20] <+notEisiger> oh fuck

[2:12:49] <%bettysharkface> Aw look at these good good dorfs waddling over to get you
[2:12:50] <%Ezguerila> there is a rare variant that coats everything in gold after it explodes
[2:12:57] <+s0ki_> yeah the waling nukes are assholes.
[2:13:54] <+s0ki_> *walking*
[2:14:07] <@dcn2049> loot bug

[2:14:28] <lloyddboy> higher?
[2:14:31] <Vemok> Did you repair that by smashing it repeatedly with a hammer? Glorious!
[2:15:09] <%bettysharkface> Nooo

[2:15:55] <jiin6> it was all MEEE
[2:16:23] <lloyddboy> someone had to throw it in from offstage
[2:17:20] <%Ezguerila> you send the mule to it
[2:17:25] <+logoth_> find a green glowing thing and interact
[2:17:33] <%Ezguerila> then you beat the living shit out of the green box
[2:17:39] <jiin6> man how do computers do?
[2:18:03] <+notEisiger> you hit the "Escape" button
[2:18:04] <jiin6> still its amazing to see a whole race of Pats

[2:20:38] <+BuriasDempsey> It looks like those light stone things in dark souls you can throw
[2:20:47] <+PapaGravestone> these are dwarves not elves, fuck the enviornmental effects of polution, and fuck the enviornment LUL
[2:21:05] <+notEisiger> hmm
[2:22:27] <jiin6> what are you talking about? they respect the environment, they give it a nice lead handshake and a fiery hello
[2:23:57] <jiin6> yes murder nature
[2:23:58] <%Ezguerila> Plague enjoys murdering innocent things
[2:24:20] <+BuriasDempsey> I don't think these things are innocent really
[2:24:31] <+notEisiger> I was about to say: enjoy your detonator
[2:24:36] <lloyddboy> if you chuck two on it it'll work
[2:24:44] <janus_the_captive> "they cant get through there." famous last words
[2:24:51] <+notEisiger> it can be frozen: it takes two grenades, but it also prevents them from exploding on death
[2:25:06] <jiin6> yeah they dare get in the way of plague's pat persona's paycheck
[2:25:43] <lloyddboy> it's called calling in a shit ton of resupply pods
[2:26:20] <+logoth_> The big glowy doo doo fruit
[2:27:00] <@dcn2049> ahaha it took you for a ride
[2:27:19] <jiin6> it wanted to show you da world
[2:27:47] <lloyddboy> it's useful at higher hazards Kappa
[2:27:49] <+notEisiger> the grab it works against will kill you if you are alone though
[2:28:09] <@dcn2049> oh god the beardless chin is terrible
[2:28:10] <%glasphemy> same face?That's racist
[2:28:12] <janus_the_captive> strong bloodline
[2:28:13] <+TheDoctor19901> are you saying all dwarves look alike Plague? you racist!
[2:28:31] <jiin6> a strong line of pat people
[2:29:42] <Ether101_Prime> Anyone have thoughts on the new Ghazghkull model?
[2:30:04] <lloyddboy> CHONK
[2:30:22] <janus_the_captive> pat and paige lineage. giant dwarves.
[2:30:22] <+Mekhet09> PAT
[2:30:26] <+notEisiger> Dr. Robotnik's Mean C&B Torture Machine
[2:31:04] <+trendytryhard> Deep Cock Cumtastic
[2:31:14] <+BuriasDempsey> I like the looks myself, then again I like the look of heavy armor and shit like that
[2:31:23] <@Nightbot> Plague is a youtube animator and also streams at https://picarto.tv/Plague . Also: t-shirts! http://goo.gl/lze8QO
[2:31:35] <janus_the_captive> just a giant mug of merlot. straight to the face
[2:31:47] <Ether101_Prime> I guess this is where the Squats went.
[2:31:49] <+notEisiger> well, let's hope he doesnt stay drunk in mission now
[2:32:16] <janus_the_captive> drop shock dwarves
[2:32:17] <+Mekhet09> Is plague playing with actual people or are they just NPCs?
[2:32:33] <+BuriasDempsey> randoms
[2:32:33] <+notEisiger> grab those nuts
[2:32:34] <%glasphemy> Cock and stone, suck my bone
[2:32:34] <+PapaGravestone> other dwarves
[2:32:41] <+notEisiger> smell em for purity
[2:32:42] <%Ezguerila> you need to be drunk and not passout to be drunk in missions
[2:33:05] <+TheDoctor19901> oh mah gawd is this fortnight! better not lose plague thats such a weak mindset!
[2:33:11] <+notEisiger> I really don't like this zone, because it all looks like Nitra and it never is
[2:33:50] <janus_the_captive> "everybody seen the leprechaun say yeaaaa!!!"
[2:33:54] <Solokaldaka> poordeHey woopsHey chat
[2:34:10] <@Nightbot> @diegogallardo91020 -> Jackpot! [stop spamming emotes] [warning]
[2:34:22] <@dcn2049> good job
[2:34:22] <lloyddboy> rock and stone say it back
[2:34:26] <%SilverRoddo> Tunnel Armr from FF6 would be bad ass in this game.
[2:34:44] <scribbledguy> @PlagueOfGripes Just caught up on your last 3 vids, loved them
[2:34:49] <janus_the_captive> this looks like a really cool game
[2:34:53] <@TheDropOutDragon> This looks fun.
[2:34:54] <+notEisiger> JoJo Galactic Rock is Unbreakable
[2:35:09] <+Shaggnar> Probably a proximity thing
[2:35:11] <Matrixvingian> Did Plague ever imagine he'd be home playing videogames with nearly 300 people watching?
[2:35:17] <cinless> it is fun dragon
[2:35:22] <General_Terro> Kreygasm I'm gonna rock and stone
[2:35:24] <cinless> and you can play it now with your shiny new laptop
[2:35:28] <janus_the_captive> starship troopers meets minecraft with dwarves
[2:35:29] <+notEisiger> don't tell him about the fossil HahaSleep
[2:35:30] <%SilverRoddo> 3 emotes is the humble limit. Btw.
[2:35:51] <janus_the_captive> ma leg
[2:36:21] <+BuriasDempsey> wait is the fossil lootable or something?
[2:36:30] <Sunstalker> I kind of wish that Naughty Dog would lend out their Jak and Daxxter franchise for someone to make a multiplayer game set in Haven City and doing jobs in that dystopia. vadeHm
[2:36:54] <%SilverRoddo> Co-operation, makes it happun.
[2:37:36] <+notEisiger> Loony Tune rules, got it
[2:37:46] <joanna9700> So this is the space dwarf game
[2:37:55] <DesuDesuDokiDoki> as in many games, no ground = die
[2:38:42] <+notEisiger> GOLD NUGGET AAAAA
[2:39:01] <janus_the_captive> aliums
[2:39:02] <+notEisiger> if you see gold flakes in the dirt, there's a nugget OSFrog
[2:39:18] <Ether101_Prime> Squats the game.
[2:39:27] <cinless> i should play more of this, it's pretty fun solo too
[2:40:02] <+notEisiger> dwarves are most definitely not PC
[2:40:29] <janus_the_captive> deep throated
[2:40:34] <+notEisiger> gutteral
[2:40:42] <cinless> idk i think dwarves are more PC than console
[2:40:55] <+notEisiger> you can die
[2:40:56] <$Valdorick> "Bullet Holders"
[2:40:58] <+Shaggnar> Bugs don't have lungs, funny they would roar
[2:41:03] <cinless> PC elitism is pretty in character for them
[2:41:28] <$Valdorick> I imagine they have those words for them, but the corporation hates when they say them.
[2:41:55] <%SilverRoddo> Exo-scuts?
[2:42:12] <+notEisiger> Plague of Gripes committing the second worst bm
[2:42:47] <cinless> no it's just a dumb pun
[2:43:03] <+notEisiger> I hear a lot of hard F's when they talk about the woodlands
[2:43:15] <+Shaggnar> Those racist console dwarfs katieLul
[2:43:15] <$Valdorick> Hey man, Console Dwarf needs to talk quietly and not use those words; his baby just went to sleep.
[2:43:15] <cinless> elf?
[2:43:17] <janus_the_captive> only good bug is a dead bug
[2:43:24] <DesuDesuDokiDoki> Console Dwarfs drop hard n's
[2:43:49] <+notEisiger> need Rank 100 to unlock the official ELF word card
[2:43:50] <+SirGO0SE> sipsipHonk heya Plague, been on awhile?
[2:43:57] <lloyddboy> pair it with vampire
[2:44:16] <+notEisiger> berserk is baller, especially with Driller's axes and drills
[2:44:19] <ohrasil> Number go up.
[2:44:36] <+notEisiger> explosion is an element
[2:44:38] <+notEisiger> acid sucks too
[2:44:48] <cinless> is acid an element? cause there's plenty of that
[2:44:58] <%Ezguerila> fuck the fire lava planets
[2:45:18] <ohrasil> Man red sugar sound like some hard drug.
[2:45:29] <+notEisiger> number one go-to perk: the friendly fire perk. can never have enough of that
[2:46:22] <lloyddboy> webs too
[2:46:51] <%bettysharkface> I got an orange o wo
[2:46:56] <+notEisiger> you can revive during that revive
[2:46:58] <lloyddboy> you can heal during it and stay up
[2:47:10] <cinless> it's wipe prevention, that is super useful
[2:47:14] <dukarian> you can revive after iron will tho
[2:47:27] <dukarian> i mean yourself
[2:47:31] <%glasphemy> Be healthy
[2:47:46] <dukarian> iron will is usefull
[2:48:29] <bahur90> vampire can save your life during iron will
[2:48:36] <nutimik> medic perk is really good
[2:48:52] <nutimik> at least for scout, zoom in, revive, zoom out
[2:49:15] <@Nightbot> @diegogallardo91020 -> Beep Boop! [stop spamming emotes] [warning]
[2:49:30] <dukarian> only for scout
[2:49:32] <diegogallardo91020> PogChamp PogChamp
[2:49:35] <dukarian> ye
[2:49:40] <IsaacClarkeANCAP> Good morning!
[2:49:50] <%Ezguerila> thorns was nerfed and it has small cooldown per hit
[2:50:08] <IsaacClarkeANCAP> This is my first time on the stream, but sadly I can stay really little because I'll have class soon.
[2:50:31] <lloyddboy> weapon builds are really what determines playstyle really
[2:50:52] <nutimik> low oxygen if you have no idea what you're getting into
[2:50:57] <nutimik> is fun*
[2:51:13] <dukarian> i cam say for haz5 with proper combo of weapons amd builds is better but this is depends
[2:51:16] <%SilverRoddo> Is that a Risk or a Dynasty Warrior style map?
[2:51:20] <dukarian> on teammates ofc
[2:51:33] <@Nightbot> Plague is a youtube animator and also streams at https://picarto.tv/Plague . Also: t-shirts! http://goo.gl/lze8QO
[2:51:34] <IsaacClarkeANCAP> owo wots dis? *notices your polygons*
[2:52:02] <%glasphemy> Don't chu notice my polygons
[2:52:05] <Coystick> Cuuuute
[2:52:11] <DesuDesuDokiDoki> UwU
[2:52:20] <DesuDesuDokiDoki> OwO?!
[2:52:23] <%glasphemy> UnU
[2:53:31] <IsaacClarkeANCAP> Just to ask, do you like Mystery Skull's work?
[2:54:13] <nutimik> you leveled really fast for only a few days
[2:54:52] <+SirGO0SE> uh oh, stinky
[2:55:36] <nutimik> there's lots of swearing in this game
[2:55:43] <lloyddboy> wish you could pet the turret
[2:55:56] <%SilverRoddo> Cue the ‚Äúbuilding a house‚Äù theme from Snes Monopoly.
[2:56:05] <nutimik> or hit the mule so it moves faster
[2:56:08] <%MajorDub> swearing in a game full of drunken dwarven miners? you don't say
[2:57:11] <TomFrank> this game looks neat
[2:57:28] <ahaegotrigger> I like this game
[2:59:15] <lloyddboy> honestly I'd get a lootbug coinpurse
[2:59:39] <%glasphemy> youre neat
[2:59:41] <%MajorDub> what game isn't?
[2:59:56] <lloyddboy> your team already got it i think
[3:01:07] <+SirGO0SE> hats, candy, and being dry?
[3:01:08] <Coystick> Numbers and how big they are - Pat
[3:01:21] <Huntercd> I hate having a cold with all this C-virus news
[3:01:31] <DesuDesuDokiDoki> I just daydream constantly.
[3:01:44] <+SirGO0SE> i think about butts A LOT
[3:01:48] <TomFrank> i tend to plan out my future
[3:01:50] <TomFrank> also butts
[3:02:16] <Huntercd> I usually think about RE, I blame Pat
[3:02:37] <+SirGO0SE> well thats the nature of competitive, you just need to find 1 person who gives slightly more shit than you to get washed
[3:02:53] <Coystick> I tend to reassure myself that the sky isn't falling and I don't gotta be so anxious all the time, and fat asses. So I like to play a game that can occupy or immerse me.
[3:02:58] <%MajorDub> that's not a bad analysis
[3:03:00] <ahaegotrigger> I love your description of Animal Crossing
[3:03:25] <+LordSDB> I never understood animal crossing, But I do miss harvest moon a bit
[3:03:26] <doggieo> Reckon simulated misery is better than real
[3:03:38] <%MajorDub> animal crossing is just a cute sims
[3:03:45] <%SilverRoddo> Once i learn a game‚Äôs context (like a Skyrim), i then put down the game music and put on a podcast-that i‚Äôve already listened to.
[3:05:00] <+YelloGek> Are you saying you DON'T like being stressed/pressured about aggressive optimization?
[3:05:08] <Huntercd> You gonna check out Nioh 2 @PlagueOfGripes
[3:05:13] <%MajorDub> what about monster hunter?
[3:05:43] <+SirGO0SE> card games are sometimes a nice mix of the two. once you learn the game you can usually be competitive while turning your brain off
[3:05:45] <Coystick> @Huntercd be cool, collected, and sanitary. It'll help you get better.
[3:06:07] <diegogallardo91020> S√≠
[3:06:20] <Huntercd> That'll teach me to lick doorknobs
[3:06:47] <Coystick> Delicious knobs
[3:06:48] <jiin6> no its a debt sim
[3:06:50] <gunsrlove> Play competative games, Eli, because it's easier and immediately more gratifying to compete and win in a game, rather than take years to be successful in life, to gain a sense of su-periority
[3:07:18] <%MajorDub> ^ this guy's got the idea
[3:08:06] <+YelloGek> Bootstrap-pulling simulator
[3:08:07] <Huntercd> Yea but animal women tho
[3:08:20] <+dieterpet> Deep Rock Galactic!
[3:08:54] <Coystick> I DL'd the COD royale, haven't played a competitive game since tittyfall 2, I expect to be shit and get frustrated and uninstall.
[3:09:22] <gunsrlove> normal CoD MW was quite frustrating, but quite rewarding in some cases
[3:09:23] <%Ezguerila> You will die again and again and again
[3:09:41] <jiin6> samarai logic
[3:09:42] <gunsrlove> But the Royale mode has even slower times to kill, and fuck that
[3:09:43] <DesuDesuDokiDoki> lightning guy?
[3:09:47] <AJusticeLemon> that guy in the demo?
[3:09:54] <Coystick> I was pretty good at tiddyfall though L-Star represent
[3:09:56] <sarangerelchinua> He means Muneshige.
[3:09:59] <Futurecity10> i agree, nioh can go to hell
[3:10:09] <sugarmostly> thoughts on sekiro
[3:10:17] <+SirGO0SE> maybe you should spend some time studying the blade
[3:10:33] <Huntercd> Yokai women have my interest in Nioh 2
[3:10:40] <DesuDesuDokiDoki> nioh was ok, I never got around to finishing it tho
[3:11:16] <gunsrlove> i got Nioh on discount , but havent tried yet
[3:11:24] <gunsrlove> I remember so many menus and micromanagment
[3:11:37] <Sneaky_Canuck> i liked nioh a lot but it had issues near the end with enemies with bloated hp later on and maze-like maps
[3:12:20] <DesuDesuDokiDoki> *nibble nibble* uwu <3
[3:12:30] <Huntercd> I never played Nioh the MC didn't interest me.
[3:13:17] <%Ezguerila> if they are plant like they are not gems
[3:15:49] <Goybin> the hologram indeed taunts, but it can do a fortnite dance so i never use it
[3:16:04] <+ATorL> Nioh was a lot of gear checks
[3:16:23] <%Ezguerila> to be fair fortnite didn't invent any of those dances
[3:16:25] <+ATorL> most of the challenge comes from how hard it is to properly itemize
[3:16:51] <gunsrlove> You mean the MINER problems AYYYYYYYYY
[3:17:00] <+PapaGravestone> angry and vindictive is dwarves in a nutshell ratirlTip
[3:17:05] <sosandstorm> One of the Miner prob- damn it
[3:17:36] <@dcn2049> Get it on console then, hahaha
[3:17:37] <Huntercd> Female Predators
[3:17:59] <@dcn2049> Then suffer
[3:18:21] <%glasphemy> Then perish
[3:18:35] <+PapaGravestone> how can a baby predator suckle? that face aint made for it
[3:18:39] <%Ezguerila> I was mildly disappointed how watered down the female predator was
[3:18:50] <DesuDesuDokiDoki> consoles are comfy
[3:18:51] <Coystick> When's Let's Plague Bloodborne? : ^ )
[3:19:20] <Sneaky_Canuck> only care doom
[3:19:31] <gunsrlove> doom next week boys
[3:19:42] <DesuDesuDokiDoki> yeyyeye DOOM
[3:19:47] <All_Salt> It seems like the only reason (for me anyway) to have a console is for exclusive games.
[3:19:49] <gunsrlove> was that and OFF sound effect
[3:19:54] <gunsrlove> OOF*
[3:19:56] <TomFrank> also would like to see lets plague bloodbborne
[3:19:57] <+YelloGek> That's a sobering thing to note. That said, I'll take the elitism for extra graphicals.
[3:20:06] <Coystick> Yeeew Dewwm
[3:20:08] <%Ezguerila> that was nice metroid spawn
[3:20:21] <+YelloGek> Or, rather, would have.
[3:21:10] <+SirGO0SE> oh thanks to you we know Kreygasm
[3:21:11] <Coystick> I will now buy your game
[3:21:14] <%SilverRoddo> plagueGripes_CL plagueGripes_CL plagueGripes_CL
[3:21:20] <@dcn2049> Plague want big booby
[3:21:26] <Sozu_> they love to snusnu
[3:21:43] <SmokelessCrack> call your mom she misses you
[3:21:45] <%bettysharkface> Nice stream, protect lootbug.
[3:21:45] <%Ezguerila> everyone wants to be thrown around by female predator
[3:21:46] <a_bigazz_sandwich> Sing a song
[3:21:50] <+SirGO0SE> Clap
[3:21:52] <Coystick> GG
[3:22:15] <DesuDesuDokiDoki> UwU daddy plague *notices bulge* OwO wats dis?
[3:22:19] <+PapaGravestone> just like real mining and drilling huh?
[3:22:35] <%Ezguerila> yea only one at a time
[3:23:46] <+YelloGek> I wonder why they'd normalize the female predators like that.
[3:23:53] <DesuDesuDokiDoki> big beard bois! fucking sick
[3:23:54] <+SirGO0SE> they got cummy beard?
[3:24:03] <%Ezguerila> probably something you unlock from boxes
[3:24:13] <%SilverRoddo> I could be kneaded on my back, by a female predator
[3:24:14] <@dcn2049> most dwarf races, the ladies also have beards
[3:24:24] <+YelloGek> I was told there are no female dwarves, and that they spring whole from holes
[3:24:28] <DesuDesuDokiDoki> female dwarfs have beards too, LotR said so
[3:24:32] <+PapaGravestone> that sounds hype. but the dev said they kinda wanted to do female dwarves i think
[3:24:52] <DesuDesuDokiDoki> NOOOOOOOOOOO
[3:24:54] <Sozu_> LUL
[3:25:00] <+SirGO0SE> looks like a penis lmao
[3:25:01] <@dcn2049> trolls more than dwarves
[3:25:03] <SmokelessCrack> SACK CHIN
[3:25:05] <mcexcadrill> why do ya think they grow beards CarlSmile
[3:25:07] <+YelloGek> Aah, deepest lore for mandatory beards.
[3:25:11] <Sozu_> thats just pat
[3:25:12] <+YelloGek> I'd hide that too.
[3:25:15] <DesuDesuDokiDoki> STOP PLEASE NOO
[3:25:23] <gunsrlove> Fat men*
[3:25:32] <%SilverRoddo> bitterLurk
[3:25:54] <+YelloGek> Mrs.Trenchbull?
[3:26:08] <+MeatBomb> same
[3:26:19] <DesuDesuDokiDoki> MIGHTY WALRUS
[3:26:19] <Goybin> @PlagueOfGripes the armored beards are unlocked through overclocks, (deep dives & weekly core hunt)
[3:26:20] <BatQuest> He's like Danny Devito's Penguin.
[3:26:25] <+YelloGek> Dwarves store their dignity in the beard.
[3:26:33] <+SirGO0SE> that's paige's type
[3:26:33] <%Ezguerila> hide the ugly
[3:26:51] <+sleepyM0UZ> well..maybe she is beautiful in dwarve eyes
[3:26:57] <+PapaGravestone> dwarf without beard is like lion without mane
[3:27:10] <gunsrlove> ...Lionesses dont have manes tho
[3:27:13] <jiin6> max starves for views
[3:27:13] <+SirGO0SE> i love when he doesnt notice us
[3:27:16] <DesuDesuDokiDoki> female dwarfs should be shortstacks
[3:27:18] <+LordSDB> Rest well Plague!
[3:27:20] <+PapaGravestone> would be generous of you LUL
[3:27:22] <%SilverRoddo> I have a chin strap.
[3:27:28] <300coolfactsaboutbears> It looked like Pat for a moment there.
[3:27:46] <%glasphemy> Oh man, sounds like me
[3:27:47] <DesuDesuDokiDoki> like a puppy
[3:27:52] <%glasphemy> No u#
[3:27:59] <jiin6> bye
