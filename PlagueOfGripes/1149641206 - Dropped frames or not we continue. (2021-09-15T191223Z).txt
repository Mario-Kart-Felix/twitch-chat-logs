[0:03:56] <HelghastTroop> i like dishonored so that neat
[0:04:07] <whittacre> I'm a fan of most of Arkane's games so I'll pick it up eventually but I'll wait for some performance patches

[0:06:06] <%Scarnehu> shrink the movie by like 10%
[0:06:07] <Coystick> The Brain That Wouldn't Die sounds like a movie that'd be in the Malcolm in the Middle intro
[0:06:14] <cap_bon> Cant watch star trek on stream feelsbad
[0:06:24] <whittacre> rather than shrinking CSP, can you just slide it sideways?

[0:11:07] <$saw6boy> "how much side boob?" Yeah
[0:11:36] <+Scevda> @coystick all shonen anime converge on a powercreeped pseudo astral fantasy aesthetic.
[0:11:45] <whittacre> isn't this only like, an hour long?
[0:11:46] <%Scarnehu> looks like she's opened up her 8th gate Bankai

[0:12:22] <+PleasantLee> sounds clear
[0:12:27] <whittacre> levels are good
[0:12:28] <$saw6boy> sounds good to me
[0:12:29] <Dunmarkh> 79% is a big number
[0:12:30] <Coystick> Herb vagina
[0:12:39] <lemoan> @scarnehu it's just devil fruits
[0:12:51] <cap_bon> So like how much closer are we to LaughTale becuase it feels like wanno arc has been going on for awhile now.
[0:12:53] <Dunmarkh> it's kinda loud
[0:12:57] <+Scevda> Im here to get to you there Eli. Well get you  a new home.
[0:13:18] <cap_bon> its hard to tell with One Piece arcs just sorta blur into one mess
[0:13:38] <+PleasantLee> there it is! the brain that wouldnt die!
[0:13:41] <$saw6boy> rehouse the farm cat
[0:13:42] <Arancet> just live in the internet
[0:14:05] <%FingaLights> Just plant some internet bushes
[0:14:09] <+Scevda> @cap_bon it sounds like theres not much distinction in the subject materials between arcs.
[0:14:09] <%Scarnehu> Sounds like the township is still refusing to move the cables like 2 miles to give you better internet. sorry to hear that man
[0:14:12] <殺害者> So, what're we watching?
[0:14:15] <Daxalog> Real doctors dont give this much of a shit do they
[0:14:22] <+PleasantLee> "maybe we should do some satan shit, doctor"
[0:14:33] <+Scevda> I love the soundscape of old movies.
[0:14:38] <$saw6boy> "Put an m80 in his rectum"
[0:14:52] <Coystick> cadaver* not corpse, c'mon writers
[0:14:59] <+Scevda> The grainy audio makes me feel warm and fuzzy.
[0:15:15] <+PleasantLee> hahahaah
[0:15:18] <@PeachSaliva> Eli, you hurt my feeling. You know I’ve only got one of those left.
[0:15:19] <+PleasantLee> brain dead cat
[0:15:25] <jrbster70> His brain died
[0:15:32] <$saw6boy> cat had a stroke
[0:15:38] <mavis_crosbee> when he steps away it looks like he removes himself from a cat skinsuit and the tuber is just like an empty skin vessel
[0:15:45] <+LittleCinders> What are we watching?
[0:15:50] <+Scevda> Lol thats a hell of a derp.
[0:15:59] <@PeachSaliva> Ur a mean cat
[0:16:01] <vizardrob> I thought he was cutting into the chest cavity.

[0:22:01] <Chaossheep> @PeachSaliva that is Kaido's son from one piece, he's so great
[0:22:09] <stjustin19> I think the person died in like an hour or so
[0:22:17] <mavis_crosbee> I thought we would have had limb transplants by the 60s wow 0-0
[0:22:18] <IsaacClarkeANCAP> @Coystick Non True Rhinoceros.
[0:22:21] <+Scevda> stealing limbs like a. Gangsta
[0:22:25] <stjustin19> but I can't remember
[0:22:34] <%Scarnehu> orphans don't really need all their legs anyway
[0:22:37] <Dunmarkh> What is the hospital going to do with all those limbs? Throw them in the trash? This guy knows what he's doing
[0:22:41] <dankodeadzone> where do you put the limb after you steal it anyway
[0:22:53] <dankodeadzone> that sounds like a lot of work
[0:22:56] <%JailShmixRemix> nice...
[0:23:00] <+PleasantLee> its really fucking nice to see a movie that doesnt cut every 15 seconds
[0:23:15] <Coystick> The Ovaries that Wouldn't Get married
[0:23:16] <@PeachSaliva> I'm happy that you're streaming more even if you are taking my cool ideas.
[0:23:21] <Ekaelis> Can you point out red flags in black and white movie?
[0:23:23] <dankodeadzone> it's her first day on the job and her last day before retirement!
[0:23:23] <+Scevda> What is this incestous family of doctors and operators.
[0:23:32] <Loxoron> This lady is so gonna die
[0:23:54] <%FingaLights> Red flags in black and white
[0:23:55] <+PleasantLee> that guy is smoking in a hospital
[0:23:56] <+Scevda> Into the fridge she goes.
[0:23:57] <@PeachSaliva> I forgot how beautiful she was.
[0:24:12] <%Scarnehu> are we walking into an ACDC jojo moment where there's just going to be a brain, pulsating on her back?
[0:24:26] <@PeachSaliva> Yeah, the lady.
[0:24:29] <MrHappyFunshine> Been a long while since i've been able to catch you live, keep getting notified about the Pictaro streams few days late.
[0:24:37] <whittacre> which actress is this?
[0:24:41] <@PeachSaliva> Oh yeah, MST3K did this one.

[0:25:16] <dankodeadzone> these are some nifty driving shots for a movie from that era, damn
[0:25:17] <Nationaleyebrow> need for speed old school
[0:25:23] <DaKnightWarrior> I really like black & white movie soundtracks.
[0:25:32] <RykerSkies> they're really getting their moneys worth from that screeching tyre sound effect
[0:25:37] <+PleasantLee> hahaahah
[0:25:40] <@PeachSaliva> @PleasantLee I do! When I drive with my top down, I usually wear a scarf bc I feel fancy.
[0:25:44] <%Scarnehu> fred durst?
[0:25:49] <dankodeadzone> the car is fine don't worry
[0:25:59] <+Scevda> @peachsaliva buckleup buckaroo.
[0:26:00] <+RealThiele> this is why you dont smoke the devil grass kids
[0:26:00] <Dunmarkh> Hey man if he went any faster than that he'd time travel
[0:26:17] <MrHappyFunshine> Oh no he has a sprained ankle and tummy ache
[0:26:27] <vizardrob> she's sleeping
[0:26:29] <%KellBeII> fire indeed hot
[0:26:33] <Ekaelis> I figured she'd die but that was sudden
[0:26:41] <mavis_crosbee> this is the music they play in looney tunes when birds are singing
[0:26:42] <dankodeadzone> if i cover the body nobody will notice
[0:26:43] <@PeachSaliva> He took her head.
[0:26:49] <+PleasantLee> did he pick up her brain?
[0:27:00] <RykerSkies> i have further questions
[0:27:01] <@PeachSaliva> She was decapitated, so he ran off with her head.
[0:27:03] <+RealThiele> ill rescue your baby, but not you
[0:27:05] <IsaacClarkeANCAP> He stole the hand Yoshikage Kira style.
[0:27:05] <dankodeadzone> he might have succeded in rescuing her if he tried more
[0:27:06] <%KellBeII> gonna save her brain!
[0:27:07] <@PeachSaliva> So he could fuck it later, presumably.
[0:27:08] <dankodeadzone> can't have that
[0:27:10] <%JailShmixRemix> Atleast he has a souvenier now
[0:27:11] <Ekaelis> Is this Frankenstein?
[0:27:14] <Coystick> He's going on a picnic with her head?
[0:27:20] <%JailShmixRemix> no @Ekaelis
[0:27:22] <Ziegsy> Ask sephiroth?
[0:27:30] <Dunmarkh> still warm
[0:27:30] <@PeachSaliva> She gives the sloppiest bjs.
[0:27:31] <+Scevda> Old soundtracks REALLY made those violins work for it.
[0:27:31] <whittacre> because the brain is where the soul is kept
[0:27:32] <stjustin19> still warm
[0:27:32] <Coystick> "I can...use this"

[0:30:19] <+NuVanDibe> haven't seen you actually online until now
[0:30:21] <%FingaLights> I watched so many old ass movies as a kid. THEM, the old king kong, war of the worlds
[0:30:22] <+NuVanDibe> what's up
[0:30:28] <Stinkomeanie> which movie is this?
[0:30:29] <+PleasantLee> I believe paramont own TWotW
[0:30:32] <mavis_crosbee> surely if its public domain you can sell it without owning the rights
[0:30:40] <+Scevda> Its like movies back then thought people were really stupid and warmed up to the idea that the audience can think.
[0:30:41] <@PeachSaliva> Plague, message me later. I have a huge list of really good films I wanna watch on stream that are public domain, but we will watch them on MY channel since this was MY idea!
[0:30:45] <@PeachSaliva> meee
[0:30:52] <lemoan> @stinkomeanie The brain that wouldn't die
[0:30:55] <+Scevda> Meeeeeee
[0:30:59] <Stinkomeanie> me, me...it was meee! @PeachSaliva
[0:31:00] <%IsaacClarkeANCAP> It's taking FOREVER!
[0:31:00] <+RealThiele> the brazilian dracula is amazing to watch
[0:31:02] <Ziegsy> Handles
[0:31:03] <SoFarFetched> Paige's totally "original" absolutely not stolen idea.
[0:31:10] <Stinkomeanie> @lemoan gracie
[0:31:11] <@PeachSaliva> it was my idea tho plz believe :(
[0:31:12] <dankodeadzone> at least they don't look like Chipp's from GG
[0:31:24] <SoFarFetched> I will believe it paige......as a treat.
[0:31:27] <+Scevda> Bubbling flask! Hell ya!
[0:31:30] <RykerSkies> i can't believe paige stole eli's idea to watch public domain films
[0:31:30] <Stinkomeanie> it's called an Ass Bow Tie in Japan
[0:31:30] <MrHappyFunshine> Paige only streams original non copyright infringing content
[0:31:37] <Arancet> paige must've had the idea in her dreams, and eli sucked them out
[0:31:38] <+Scevda> That means science is happening.
[0:31:40] <Zerenis> Peach stealing Plague’s ideas again? Must be another Wednesday
[0:31:44] <%IsaacClarkeANCAP> XD
[0:31:47] <+PleasantLee> @PlagueOfGripes those things on her back are called "obi" and are big rope belts. status symbol
[0:31:47] <SoFarFetched> Paige may bamboozle people......once.
[0:31:47] <@PeachSaliva> No, I gave the website to YOU
[0:31:52] <%IsaacClarkeANCAP> She's ready to wear the wig!
[0:31:53] <@PeachSaliva> Because I am so generous
[0:32:07] <SoFarFetched> paige gifted you the website AND herself at the same time.
[0:32:08] <+RealThiele> meeee
[0:32:10] <+Scevda> @mrhappyfunshine in the missionary position.
[0:32:11] <MrHappyFunshine> S C I E N C E
[0:32:14] <dankodeadzone> it was all part of her plan
[0:32:16] <vizardrob> HAS SCIENCE GONE TOO FAR?
[0:32:17] <Ekaelis> Welp, she's paralyzed neck down
[0:32:21] <Ziegsy> they did this IRL with dogs and its heartbreaking
[0:32:27] <dankodeadzone> SCIENCE LUNGS IT'S FINE
[0:32:38] <+Scevda> A human head!
[0:32:42] <Dunmarkh> he's just got a desk fan blowing through her vocal chords
[0:32:44] <@PeachSaliva> @ziegsy I am choosing not to believe you, even if this is true.
[0:32:45] <+NuVanDibe> dark
[0:32:46] <@PeachSaliva> That's terrifying
[0:32:47] <CyberDingus> PixelBob Nothing was impossible for the OLD science
[0:32:47] <SoFarFetched> you should quiz her plague on the website name without cheating
[0:32:58] <%Nationaleyebrow> it was zone's idea after all
[0:33:04] <+RealThiele> complete her
[0:33:04] <+arzeniccatnip> oh hello peach and Eli :33
[0:33:08] <dankodeadzone> we can rebuild her
[0:33:09] <+Scevda> Her voice would be so weird.
[0:33:09] <@PeachSaliva> I will give her a fatter ass.
[0:33:13] <Ziegsy> @PeachSaliva we had to watch footage in school. Its, yeah Dont believe it, stay happy
[0:33:13] <%IsaacClarkeANCAP> Bye then, have a nice night! Btw: we can reconstruct her, we have the technology!
[0:33:19] <MrHappyFunshine> Just gets a skeleton
[0:33:28] <@PeachSaliva> She had a haahhhtt
[0:33:30] <Stinkomeanie> "We will give her what she's always wanted, a ghetto booty!"
[0:33:37] <%FingaLights> Make a TRUE Cat girl
[0:33:39] <dankodeadzone> @PeachSaliva everyone in the science community will be amazed  by the clap of her asscheeks!
[0:33:39] <approachingdeath> But can she burp her abc’s without all that air from her lungs?
[0:33:50] <+RealThiele> harrer
[0:34:07] <@PeachSaliva> lol
[0:34:13] <MrHappyFunshine> The strongest head
[0:34:13] <CyberDingus> PixelBob With the power of SCIENCE he will make any head-onahole he wants
[0:34:14] <+NuVanDibe> sounds like a fun time
[0:34:15] <@PeachSaliva> I mean, that's what I do every morning.
[0:34:20] <MrHappyFunshine> so strong
[0:34:22] <Coystick> And every stream
[0:34:24] <+NuVanDibe> @PeachSaliva LUL
[0:34:28] <%Nationaleyebrow> what if we attach the head to some cute animal?
[0:34:32] <dankodeadzone> LUL
[0:34:34] <atgithursdays> like that zombie in return of the living dead
[0:34:35] <+RealThiele> that nice round number of 50
[0:34:41] <@PeachSaliva> I'm sorry what
[0:34:41] <Stinkomeanie> You did it backwards, you're suppose to remove the head from the body not the other way around! You removed the best parts roofleSolshake
[0:34:46] <@PeachSaliva> I don't remember the hand thing.
[0:34:49] <atgithursdays> "I can feel myself rotting...the brains make the pain go away!"
[0:34:54] <dankodeadzone> Dio Brando already tried that, Human heads on cat bodies are a nono
[0:34:57] <%Pappajimbo> yeah just glue the spine bro
[0:34:58] <+RealThiele> thats some sausage hands
[0:35:21] <Ziegsy> Human heads on dog bodies worked great in mars attacks
[0:35:41] <Zerenis> I hope Plague gives Yamato extra pointy teeth
[0:35:42] <@PeachSaliva> Somebody beating off behind the door.
[0:35:42] <headlessponcedeleon> Hi plague
[0:35:43] <%Nationaleyebrow> i remember that movie
[0:35:47] <Stinkomeanie> the only way it would work would be a human head on a gorilla
[0:35:55] <%FingaLights> Pat in the closet with chocolate
[0:35:57] <MrHappyFunshine> its the fella that masterbates all day
[0:35:59] <RykerSkies> are ya winnin' son

[0:36:28] <mavis_crosbee> head lady x guy going rah rah in the closet
[0:36:29] <dankodeadzone> oh please tell me they made an amalgam of all the body parts they stole
[0:36:30] <CyberDingus> PixelBob Some zombie was masturbating, with Enthusiasm!
[0:36:30] <Coystick> Get out of my masturbation closet you pervert
[0:36:36] <+Scevda> MEG

[0:36:59] <+RealThiele> that nice murder stare at the camera
[0:37:07] <Stinkomeanie> was that guy squanching in there?
[0:37:12] <MrHappyFunshine> "If he breaks out he is going to fuck the head doctor"
[0:37:23] <+RoosterSauces> Body is where all the pain is, just get rid of it
[0:37:26] <Coystick> Oh man imagine if he brought the head back and she was a total sex fiend, into the weirdest shit ever. That'd be a movie.
[0:37:29] <dankodeadzone> yeah science stops her from feeling the pain
[0:37:32] <lemoan> @viciousgrim The brain that wouldn't die
[0:37:37] <dankodeadzone> science can do anything
[0:37:41] <viciousgrim> @lemoan ty
[0:37:42] <@PeachSaliva> lol imagine if you could just go out shopping for your girlfriend's new body.
[0:37:43] <%JailShmixRemix> That cardboard is looking damn fine
[0:37:43] <+PleasantLee> ....is he going to fuck that cardboard
[0:37:43] <+RealThiele> brought to you by lucky strikes!
[0:37:46] <Ziegsy> so this is the original weird science, right?
[0:37:47] <stjustin19> We can rebuild her
[0:37:47] <%Pappajimbo> no nervios system would help
[0:37:52] <%KellBeII> he literally IS going to give her a fatter ass
[0:37:55] <+PleasantLee> nice
[0:37:56] <EuropanLamprey> IS he actually thinking of kidnapping a hooker?
[0:37:59] <Zerenis> Almost certainly
[0:38:02] <Coystick> I feel a knew fetish being born within me
[0:38:07] <dankodeadzone> oh my god we WERE JOKING BUT THE MOVIE ISN'T WHAT
[0:38:08] <+RealThiele> oh yeah hes goin GTA on that hooker
[0:38:09] <Dunmarkh> Is he just going to murder a stripper and take her body?  based
[0:38:21] <+Scevda> As flat as her personality! Heyp
[0:38:27] <viciousgrim> @PeachSaliva is that not what most sugar daddys do?
[0:38:35] <@PeachSaliva> Listen, he's just buying what they're sellin' HEY-O
[0:38:38] <EuropanLamprey> Can you not tell by the music?
[0:38:39] <lemoan> @dunmarkh not very redpilled of you
[0:38:40] <Ziegsy> ANKLES!
[0:38:48] <+faytthepally> Exposed shoulders...so hawt
[0:38:49] <%KellBeII> a goner you might say
[0:38:49] <+PleasantLee> check out them GAMS
[0:38:51] <elweebdoctor> lol
[0:38:51] <Coystick> She's sorta just pretending she's an ostrich
[0:38:55] <Dunmarkh> the 1950s were a mysterious time
[0:38:56] <MrHappyFunshine> the high class hard on
[0:38:57] <@PeachSaliva> A very sexy ostrich
[0:38:59] <%FingaLights> They classy boner, with a monocle
[0:39:07] <dankodeadzone> and a top hat
[0:39:09] <sephyrbr> The audience  is 60% women and it's amazing
[0:39:10] <+lazylazejv5> I want a Gentleman's boner
[0:39:11] <whittacre> a true gentlemen disregards his fellow's boner
[0:39:13] <Ziegsy> yeah they found big bird REALLY sexy didnt they?
[0:39:17] <+RealThiele> put a small hat on your boner as is proper
[0:39:24] <+Scevda> I thought the censoring was later, like 70s
[0:39:26] <Ziegsy> @RealThiele and a monocle
[0:39:28] <+LittleCinders> A boner with a fancy moustache and googly eyes
[0:39:37] <MrHappyFunshine> Do not question the methods of a scientist!
[0:39:42] <approachingdeath> A gentleman boner doesn’t occur in jeans, they occur in slacks
[0:39:45] <Ziegsy> @LittleCinders thats my new Vtuber model
[0:39:59] <+LittleCinders> @ziegsy hot
[0:40:18] <@PeachSaliva> So movies were pre-code in like 1930-34. So movies kind of before 35 have nudity and sex and shit
[0:40:28] <@PeachSaliva> It's really weird to look at old timey films and see them doing shit
[0:40:41] <sephyrbr> Hays code was so bonkers
[0:40:43] <+RealThiele> before we had to cover the tiddies for the children
[0:41:11] <dankodeadzone> they're perfect for a gentlemen's twitch boner
[0:41:12] <@PeachSaliva> Don't worry, Eli. Being that this was my idea, I have a big list of films that are pre-code and which are safe.
[0:41:13] <%JailShmixRemix> twitch is fine with nudity as long as its artistic :)
[0:41:16] <+Scevda> Given how long this scene is dragging, THIS was the real reason for why it was made.
[0:41:20] <+PleasantLee> god, this titty bar sucks, keeps playing the same song on loop
[0:41:27] <+RealThiele> artisitc hottub stream :)
[0:41:37] <%FingaLights> Is movie nudity fine?
[0:41:37] <@PeachSaliva> @JailShmixRemix Sadly not true. Twitch is fine with nudity if it is in context of a game.
[0:41:39] <%KellBeII> " you got huge boobs"
[0:41:44] <MrHappyFunshine> First party nudity is fine by Twitch
[0:41:45] <@PeachSaliva> Movie nudity is sadly not fine with twitch.
[0:41:46] <%Nationaleyebrow> another head in the bag
[0:41:48] <Zerenis> I saw part of shoulders! Hot damn!
[0:41:51] <whittacre> "That's a very terrifying un-living head you have, Doctor. Now will you be a dear and examine my knockers for an hour?"
[0:42:04] <%FingaLights> That's kinda silly
[0:42:06] <approachingdeath> The children can have a little drugs and boob, as a treat
[0:42:10] <lemoan> nice hair
[0:42:19] <Ziegsy> night of the living dead is public domain? sweet
[0:42:46] <@PeachSaliva> @Ziegsy yep, probably the most famous one
[0:42:49] <%JailShmixRemix> @PeachSaliva Thats beyond dumb.
[0:42:49] <+RealThiele> make her stay awake during this yeah
[0:42:50] <+Scevda> “I want your body…and nothing else”
[0:42:56] <@PeachSaliva> There are also some surprising examples of films that are in public domain due to copyright error.
[0:43:00] <Ziegsy> 'my nose.. it itches'
[0:43:03] <EuropanLamprey> "KIll me"  "Later"
[0:43:07] <dankodeadzone> "this is not very scrumptious dude"
[0:43:09] <@PeachSaliva> I can't remember the name but there's an Audrey Hepburn film that is public domain.
[0:43:12] <Coystick> "Let me dye...my hair"
[0:43:13] <@PeachSaliva> Because they goofed it.
[0:43:30] <@PeachSaliva> You gotta be careful though because sometimes public domain films will have copyrighted music.
[0:43:41] <lemoan> @europanlamprey why isn't she refrigerated?
[0:43:48] <@PeachSaliva> I'm sorry, did she say she was 21?
[0:43:56] <Coystick> OVER 21 it's fine
[0:44:00] <lemoan> @peachsaliva OVER 21
[0:44:00] <%FingaLights> I think over 21?
[0:44:03] <dankodeadzone> oh yeah just like all those teens in 80s movies
[0:44:06] <+RealThiele> thats what bein 21 is like with 2 packs of lucky strikes a day
[0:44:08] <dankodeadzone> totally not 30+
[0:44:15] <+PleasantLee> I bet this over 30 years old actress liked saying that line
[0:44:17] <+Scevda> OVER
[0:44:29] <@PeachSaliva> lmao if she's 21 I'm the queen of england
[0:44:32] <CyberDingus> PixelBob Suave man.
[0:44:33] <Loxoron> He’s checking the base of her neck to see if the circumference is right oh jeez
[0:44:35] <+NuVanDibe> picture's pretty cute
[0:44:47] <Coystick> G-Strings existed back then?
[0:44:47] <%JailShmixRemix> Oh I like her
[0:44:48] <%FingaLights> @PeachSaliva Look, life was rough back then
[0:44:51] <+silvery_cricket> @peachsaliva hello your majesty

[0:45:48] <+RealThiele> woof rejected
[0:45:55] <dankodeadzone> >that moment when the prostitutes start arguing while you're trying to keep your gentleman boner
[0:45:56] <EuropanLamprey> Didn't he say his wife only has two days to live and hes wasting time on this?
[0:45:58] <+Scevda> “I find you handsome but ill go out of my way to never actually say that”
[0:46:15] <+RealThiele> @EuropanLamprey hes scoping out hookers to get a new body for her
[0:46:16] <+PleasantLee> YEAH
[0:46:16] <@PeachSaliva> hell yeah
[0:46:26] <Loxoron> The prostitutes are too annoying for me to murder and take their bodies right now :/
[0:46:27] <+Scevda> “No witnesses”
[0:46:27] <+PleasantLee> I hope a titty falls out
[0:46:27] <%KellBeII> jesus we really havent changed much
[0:46:27] <MrHappyFunshine> Outstanding

[0:46:47] <dankodeadzone> GATO
[0:46:48] <%KellBeII> to sybolize the cat fight
[0:46:52] <+faytthepally> Good to know ladies fighting has always been a thing for refined gentlemen
[0:46:54] <Ziegsy> That meow WAS the tity?
[0:46:58] <%KellBeII> cause the movie is stupid
[0:47:01] <lemoan> cat fight
[0:47:04] <+Scevda> Ladies and gentlemen, the real reason the movie was made
[0:47:06] <approachingdeath> A cat is about to eat the head
[0:47:12] <EuropanLamprey> @dankodeadzone Third rate stripper with a fourth rate taint
[0:47:25] <+RealThiele> wow she got her wits back real quick like

[0:47:56] <dankodeadzone> where's Aigor when you need him
[0:47:56] <Loxoron> From what I can tell there’s only like two dudes making the Frankenstein monsters here
[0:47:57] <+RealThiele> he gets hungry he can just eat off one of his sausages
[0:48:01] <%FingaLights> Hammer hands
[0:48:06] <@Nightbot> Plague is a youtube animator and also streams at https://picarto.tv/Plague . Also: t-shirts! http://goo.gl/lze8QO
[0:48:12] <@PeachSaliva> I guess but
[0:48:13] <+faytthepally> @PeachSaliva  What's she gonna do?  Run away?
[0:48:22] <dankodeadzone> she's going to lose her head over it
[0:48:27] <+Scevda> The totally not Igor stand in
[0:48:28] <EuropanLamprey> You just woke up lady
[0:48:39] <Loxoron> Is Igor here listening or is he somewhere completely different
[0:48:40] <OminousBagel> She shouldn't get a head of herself
[0:48:49] <%FingaLights> Hey girl, keep your head on your shoulders
[0:48:52] <@PeachSaliva> Why is she so hellbent on revenge already? She literally just woke up.
[0:48:57] <Ziegsy> I listened to Metallica, I have a notion
[0:49:04] <dankodeadzone> don't worry girl, we're heading home after this
[0:49:05] <+RealThiele> no coffee!?! REVENGE TIME
[0:49:10] <+PleasantLee> its nice that someone is doing the make up for the bodyless woman
[0:49:16] <OminousBagel> Is this where Futurama got the head in the jar thing from?
[0:49:18] <lemoan> i think he upstairs
[0:49:25] <+purplehazy> derpixWave @PlagueOfGripes
[0:49:28] <Ziegsy> omfg
[0:49:29] <+Scevda> Its actually been 3 weeks. Hes been on a bender in atlantic city this entire time.
[0:49:31] <dankodeadzone> wasn't there a movie with Hitler's head in a jar?
[0:49:32] <%FingaLights> Revenge cause no soul. Science evil
[0:49:34] <dankodeadzone> from the 30s?
[0:49:45] <+RealThiele> literary poison, a literal talking head
[0:50:07] <approachingdeath> A power that isnt as effective as having a body
[0:50:12] <+Scevda> Shes telekinetic now?!?!
[0:50:19] <EuropanLamprey> Is she possessed?
[0:50:31] <Loxoron> “Damn wish my friend was here with his hooker body so I could make sure she doesn’t keep acting evil”
[0:50:39] <Dunmarkh> @EuropanLamprey no she's just really mad that scientist saved her life
[0:50:43] <dankodeadzone> evil frankenstein hooker mmmmh
[0:51:00] <EuropanLamprey> So why is she talking about having magic powers?
[0:51:02] <+PleasantLee> come on guys, everyone knows when you're decapitated your brain gets extra strong. its like when you go blind, all your other senses get a kick up in power
[0:51:05] <dankodeadzone> i need to rewatch frankenhooker
[0:51:21] <@PeachSaliva> lol this look slike a high school play's set
[0:51:43] <+Scevda> The funny thing about the slow pace in these old movies is that people hesitant go so long they make you think they had a stroke instead.
[0:51:46] <Loxoron> This looks like a living room they emptied
[0:51:52] <EuropanLamprey> No, shes possessed guys
[0:51:59] <dankodeadzone> that's just how science rooms looked in the 50s
[0:51:59] <MrHappyFunshine> Now she just pranking them
[0:51:59] <approachingdeath> All she needed to unlock 100% of her brain, was to be beheaded

[1:11:59] <lemoan> @kyh9 a scar. hard to see cause b&w
[1:12:06] <tanarath> SAND AWAY
[1:12:11] <Dunmarkh> just bust out the sandpaper
[1:12:12] <+RealThiele> since your body is just a pile of skin
[1:12:28] <tanarath> Just samd away the skin
[1:12:30] <%sparklinghallow> so that's how you fix a scar
[1:12:31] <Loxoron> He accidentally found magic Frankenstein goo and he’s just been failing forward for the rest of it

[1:14:35] <Loxoron> I love that every single time it’s another lady who he’s worried about knowing about it
[1:14:37] <Hal10k> The moral of the story is to never have hope for corrective cosmetic surgery or else someone will steal your body for somebody else's brain
[1:14:37] <%JailShmixRemix> Just Bonk her already
[1:14:45] <tanarath> I should trust in man despite all of the abuse, not woman.

[1:16:45] <Dunmarkh> "I'm so angry worms aren't eating my charred head in a shallow grave right now"

[1:18:23] <+Scevda> Is this a gay allegory?!
[1:18:23] <approachingdeath> A wad of gum behind the door
[1:18:31] <+PleasantLee> if I was just a head that could bang on peoples doors with telekinesis, life would be so good
[1:18:35] <Loxoron> So why didn’t they kill the fucked up horror monster they made previously

[1:23:38] <+RealThiele> i trust you with that horse paste
[1:23:51] <%0ni0n_L0rd> You know us men. We love our lewd experiments.
[1:24:06] <%FingaLights> "Does it look like I'm keeping a head alive and looking for a body to take to transplant it onto"
[1:24:19] <viciousgrim> or would he?
[1:24:30] <+RealThiele> doin the ol' gil tie tug
[1:24:49] <Ziegsy> 'What did you do?! bite his arm off?!'
[1:24:53] <Loxoron> He’s got extra parts in case the lady up stairs doesn’t work for him now
[1:24:57] <+Scevda> Sup bitch
[1:25:19] <%sparklinghallow> ah yes, a white sheet will hide this body
[1:25:22] <Incrodon> That sounds like how I would do it, I am very smart.
[1:25:24] <Loxoron> Sure is taking a long time to get an alcohol, oh well
[1:25:26] <+RealThiele> ignore those feet
[1:25:37] <TheHauntedTank> the feet sticking out is hilarious
[1:25:59] <Loxoron> Wait did the monster close the little door, that’s adorable
[1:26:04] <TheresAGoff> "One for her, One for Me"
[1:26:13] <%0ni0n_L0rd> He's not trying to hide it I think. He's just covering it up so he doesn't have to fucking look at it every time he goes down there
[1:26:15] <+PleasantLee> it'd be great if he put drugs in both glasses
[1:26:16] <+RealThiele> when i do surgery i need a good shot or 2 to calm the nerves
[1:26:17] <%0ni0n_L0rd> At least I hope
[1:26:47] <zanzibarian_hamster> Yeah I mean the disembodied head is in the middle of the room, hiding the dead guy is the least oo his concerns
[1:26:55] <Zerenis> Shouldn’t there be a big blood stain on the door?
[1:27:07] <%JailShmixRemix> Corpse adds to the body of wine
[1:27:36] <+RealThiele> a young bill taking notes

[1:29:30] <dankodeadzone> it's more rapey probably
[1:30:08] <tanarath> BACK WHEN WE COULD TREAT WOMEN AS THEY DES-I mean as human beings, yes.
[1:30:25] <Loxoron> He gave himself the time to put the lab coat on
[1:30:29] <Ziegsy> I thought that bottle was an erection and was puzzled
[1:30:43] <Zerenis> Nothing would make me happier then if he was super careful, pulled out all the fine tools, then out of nowhere grabbed an axe and chopped her head off
[1:30:44] <%FingaLights> Yes, but that was a man]
[1:30:59] <Dunmarkh> @FingaLights a deformed man even
[1:31:00] <lewdnekojam> its the 50s it was the tradtion of the time
[1:31:09] <+RealThiele> Mongo telepathy

[1:32:29] <+Scevda> Its an egg man
[1:32:31] <Coystick> How does this fit the head/brain theme?
[1:32:31] <lewdnekojam> reminds me of my uncle lap for some reason
[1:32:42] <rittergeist> It's Sloths slightly more deformed cousin.
[1:32:47] <Incrodon> you laugh, but that slap can snap a klingons spine in 3 hits!
[1:32:48] <Coystick> He's a melty conehead
[1:32:49] <Loxoron> Who’s head did they take for him that he turned out like that

[1:33:55] <+Scevda> More frankenstein allegory.
[1:33:55] <lewdnekojam> pranked

[1:34:04] <dankodeadzone> wat
[1:34:14] <%0ni0n_L0rd> ....so that's it?
[1:34:15] <%JailShmixRemix> He's different from other guys
[1:34:20] <Coystick> What a classic
[1:34:23] <+5Two> They got the name of the movie wrong...
[1:34:27] <lewdnekojam> gg ez
[1:34:29] <Loxoron> And that’s how Sasquatch was born ladies and gentlemen
[1:34:32] <%0ni0n_L0rd> Good for him I guess
[1:34:33] <Zarender> fleshyyHypehype fleshyyHypehype
[1:34:34] <dankodeadzone> the true hero gets the girl
[1:34:35] <Hal10k> One thing I love about old movies before standard credit lengths was the way they can just careen to a halt.
[1:34:37] <Loxoron> From a hooker murder gone wrong
[1:34:37] <CyberDingus> PixelBob The ogre is going to Swamp that woman.
[1:34:38] <%Nationaleyebrow> best happy end
[1:34:39] <Zerenis> I can see almost exactly where they ran out of budget LUL
[1:34:41] <Tracazoid> Plot: Solved
[1:34:42] <%Pappajimbo> what a chad
[1:34:42] <Vyskus> I came in in the last ten minutes
[1:34:42] <%FingaLights> So who was he?
[1:34:43] <%0ni0n_L0rd> I'm happy for the big guy
[1:34:43] <stjustin19> good for him
[1:34:45] <+Shaggnar> That was dumb, I loved it
[1:34:48] <Vyskus> so it was pretty good
[1:34:51] <%0ni0n_L0rd> Shame about the head girl though
[1:34:52] <RevenTheLight> but then it died
[1:34:53] <+RealThiele> 3rd rate hooker
[1:35:00] <%JailShmixRemix> I expected it to be bad, but I didn't expect the ending to be 3 seconds
[1:35:00] <%Bluwizard21> can't wait for the sequel the legs that wouldnt quit
[1:35:03] <dankodeadzone> you can use the title to describe the screenwriter too
[1:35:03] <+5Two> I'd already seen the mst3k version
[1:35:03] <elweebdoctor> what a happy ending
[1:35:04] <tanarath> @pleasantlee given the ending of Frankenstein, yeah. She got a super smart, super strong, immortal bf.
[1:35:05] <Loxoron> Atleast the guys dad will get a cool insurance payout
[1:35:09] <%Nationaleyebrow> waifu builder experiment failed
[1:35:09] <Dunmarkh> At least she burned to death like she wanted to in the end
[1:35:10] <EuropanLamprey> "We didn't understand transplants so they must be evil!"
[1:35:11] <vladtet909> I've seen that movie at least a dozen times but it's still pretty damn funny
[1:35:12] <lewdnekojam> i learned that women who dont get beaten become immortal witches with psyche powers so we men must bonk them for their safety
[1:35:13] <+Scevda> A good half of that movie was just strip club footage.
[1:35:28] <rittergeist> The reveal of the ugly man was kinda underwhelming.
[1:35:28] <%sparklinghallow> I love this movie but oh boy forgot how quick that ending is
[1:35:31] <+DeadlyPeaks> I think House on Haunted Hill is public domain. It’s pretty good, has Vincent Price in it
[1:35:32] <smile64> next up, sita sings the blues Kappa
[1:35:34] <+Scevda> I found Forbidden planet actually good.
[1:35:36] <Zerenis> No one could say that wasn’t a movie
[1:35:42] <EuropanLamprey> no
[1:35:43] <+PleasantLee> I'd be proud
[1:35:44] <+RealThiele> it was on film
[1:35:48] <+PleasantLee> and its all up from there
[1:35:50] <TheresAGoff> Someone is watching that film 50 years later, I'd call that a win
[1:35:53] <%Nationaleyebrow> thank god this wasn't peaches idea
[1:35:57] <%FingaLights> @DeadlyPeaks that was a movie i watched all the time as a kid. I loved it
[1:36:01] <Coystick> THE APE
[1:36:02] <dankodeadzone> AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAPE
[1:36:03] <rittergeist> How scared do you think people in the 50's found movies like this?

[1:37:55] <+RealThiele> reject modernity
[1:38:09] <+DracosMagala> Hello
[1:38:10] <Hal10k> Pretty sure Prehistoric Women is post-Hays Code so it can't be that bad
[1:38:12] <%FingaLights> @KaitlynnHere probably tied
[1:38:14] <+Grossly_Incandescent_> prehisoric as in before razors?
[1:38:17] <Loxoron> Does it say what year they released on the website you’re using?
[1:38:19] <Zerenis> The Planet of Pre? KomodoHype
[1:38:22] <+PleasantLee> I wish we could voyage to the planet of she beasts
[1:38:25] <rittergeist> I feel like a lot of these old movies involving monsterous women were basically just fetish fuel.
[1:38:28] <Coystick> Or Attack of the 50 ft Ovaries
[1:38:38] <KaitlynnHere> @fingalights true, maybe I’m asking too much from that time
[1:38:40] <+Shaggnar> Apparently this is an adaptation of a soviet movie
[1:38:43] <+RealThiele> pre history Kreygasm
[1:38:50] <+Scevda> @rittergeist indoubtably
[1:38:59] <tanarath> Prehistoric she beast
[1:39:00] <%Nationaleyebrow> does that mean prehistoric women are furries?
[1:39:07] <CyberDingus> PixelBob Planet of pre-history women. Actual death by Snu Snu!
[1:39:08] <KaitlynnHere> She a beast?!
[1:39:25] <Zerenis> Yamato got that Sasuke bow
[1:39:40] <+RealThiele> embrace Unga
[1:39:43] <KaitlynnHere> @nationaleyebrow well razors didn’t exist yet so yes
[1:40:05] <rittergeist> @PlagueOfGripes If you got sent back to the 50's, do you think you could get a job illustrating poster for shitty movies like these, I feel like you'd do good at it.
[1:40:26] <Zerenis> Who would have guessed?!?
[1:40:37] <Loxoron> Just checked the age rating, there’s no nudity
[1:40:41] <Loxoron> Hopefully
[1:40:44] <Dunmarkh> @Loxoron fuck.
[1:40:46] <%Bluwizard21> ah yes that 80p quality
[1:40:50] <CyberDingus> PixelBob Time for Snu Snu lads!
[1:40:58] <TheresAGoff> Anybody ever watch CaveGirl the kids show by the BBC?
[1:41:04] <Zarender> laynaSip
[1:41:10] <%Bluwizard21> she kinda looks like android 21
[1:41:13] <tanarath> Amazing
[1:41:18] <lewdnekojam> this is the real moonlanding looks like
[1:41:26] <+RealThiele> specific function
[1:41:29] <KaitlynnHere> Look! They’re docking
[1:41:32] <Coystick> See, I told you they faked it
[1:41:33] <vladtet909> Did this movie come out before the Apollo disater?
[1:41:33] <rittergeist> They broke out the heavy budget for this shit.
[1:41:33] <%FingaLights> The moons so small!!
[1:41:36] <Tracazoid> Hey DS9
[1:41:37] <+Scevda> Hey now, apollo was fucking dope.
[1:41:59] <+Shaggnar> That model is adorable
[1:42:03] <Coystick> But what if wheel, were to BETRAY man?
[1:42:07] <EuropanLamprey> These are the shittiest wheels ever made
[1:42:13] <Flamethrowerman09> I honestly thought that she wouldn't have a Devil Fruit, and if she did, then it would have been a Tiger Devil Fruit, because of the myth of the tiger and the dragon.
[1:42:20] <Zerenis> Those wheels look awful
[1:42:27] <+Shaggnar> Women I guess
[1:42:31] <Coystick> "All over the world, men (and women)"
[1:42:42] <Loxoron> The parents guide for she beast says there is one scene where there’s a cleavage @plagueofgripes
[1:42:44] <tanarath> Only home things, though.
[1:42:47] <whittacre> @Coystick you mean Rubber?
[1:42:52] <Ziegsy> Iheard 'Sorces of poo'
[1:42:54] <+Scevda> @loxoron lewd
[1:42:57] <KaitlynnHere> At least that’s not as bad as ender games
[1:43:10] <+RealThiele> Horse paste and shame is what the future holds 1950
[1:43:12] <HyperFerret> I love the echo on his voice, like he's projecting his voice from space
[1:43:13] <Tracazoid> All of this just to have a dumb plot about prehistoric woman
[1:43:18] <+esoteric_simp> cute minatures
[1:43:18] <KaitlynnHere> “Oh women? Yea they devolved”
[1:43:31] <+PleasantLee> "no matter how far man evolves, prehistoric women still exist on some remote planet, and we WILL get there"
[1:43:34] <Ziegsy> Anyone here british and watch blue peter?
[1:43:37] <vladtet909> "The Filmgroup"
[1:43:39] <Ziegsy> These models

[1:44:12] <KaitlynnHere> OooooOOOooooo
[1:44:14] <atgithursdays> apparently the parents guide for Dead Alive says "we cannot stress enough just how much blood and gore are in this film."
[1:44:32] <Coystick> That's all they had
[1:44:46] <Scevda> @atgithursdays truth
[1:44:47] <FingaLights> It's a rock
[1:44:52] <KaitlynnHere> “We need more atmosphere!”
[1:44:56] <TheresAGoff> Cool seeing credits at the beginning instead of the end
[1:44:58] <%FingaLights> and there are waves
[1:45:01] <Zerenis> True. They didn’t have the big weiner special effects. Had to make do with what they had
[1:45:01] <Coystick> It's an atmospheric rock
[1:45:02] <lewdnekojam> also their budget is like 50 bucks tops
[1:45:04] <FingaLights> ooOOOOooo
[1:45:07] <Bluwizard21> someone was wah chang this movie at least
[1:45:11] <Ziegsy> @atgithursdays thats such a good movie
[1:45:19] <+KnifeyMcEdge> Its SpoooOOoooKy
[1:45:30] <Coystick> The rock is haunted

[1:50:50] <lemoan> @incrodon texas was too big and fucked off to space
[1:50:52] <+RealThiele> well in 1998 they learned that you can just walka round in space
[1:51:09] <Dunmarkh> Houston Texas has never interacted with space in any way

[1:53:54] <%Explodincatz> New Venus still as hot as the old Venus
[1:53:55] <Loxoron> Is this narrator actually one of the guys in the shuttle or no?
[1:54:01] <vladtet909> Haha... Benis :DDD
[1:54:05] <Loxoron> I can’t tell honestly
[1:54:07] <RykerSkies> if they've established space stations you'd think they'd have at least taken a look at venus before now
[1:54:14] <+Shaggnar> It's like the people that came to America and named their town after a town in England, then the next town they got to they named after that same town again
[1:54:17] <KaitlynnHere> We’re going to penetrate Venus so hard
[1:54:19] <+Scevda> Yep!

[1:57:21] <Loxoron> Johns space suit fucks, he’s so cool
[1:57:27] <+Scevda> “I will now hug this boulder”
[1:57:30] <AFewGoodTaters> nobaCry
[1:57:31] <+RealThiele> prehistoric women love their tentacle planet
[1:57:32] <Dunmarkh> Why wouldn't you bring a gun into space?
[1:57:37] <Zerenis> Robot John is a real one
[1:57:37] <%Pappajimbo> best robot ever
[1:57:40] <EuropanLamprey> Why is the ground covered in dicks?

[1:58:26] <+RealThiele> @Loxoron but what if they miss out on the prehistoric women
[1:58:33] <Incrodon> @Loxoron They need a WHITE MAN to plant a flag and stuff.
[1:58:33] <AFewGoodTaters> plague is a anime
[1:58:35] <+Scevda> @loxoron that would not be honorable-Worf
[1:58:40] <AFewGoodTaters> i knew it
[1:58:53] <elweebdoctor> John the waifu detector 3000
[1:59:02] <EuropanLamprey> Venus is only as big as Earth, how hard can it be?
[1:59:12] <+RealThiele> and then party 3 caught fire, crashed, and sank into the swamp
[1:59:19] <+KiwiRedgrave> tibby
[1:59:20] <+Scevda> We got to texas and got some bbq
[1:59:22] <EuropanLamprey> Its not like we didnt plan out a landing site ahead of tim-- ah shit

[1:59:26] <KaitlynnHere> Your stream is stuttering a bit, here and there
[1:59:35] <Coystick> s y m b o l i s m
[1:59:37] <whittacre> Rocket ship, sponsored by Tampax

[1:59:44] <ashpr1m3> @PlagueOfGripes is this going on youtube

[1:59:57] <Coystick> Giger worked on this under a ghost name
[2:00:00] <%KellBeII> perverts star trek
[2:00:01] <+RealThiele> they built some expensive models and they are gonna use them
[2:00:03] <%FingaLights> I hope this movie is just them constantly shooting more people to venus then lossing signal, then sending more people
[2:00:05] <lemoan> @dunmarkh yeah to kill em all
[2:00:12] <rdddy> what is this pinhead in space?
[2:00:15] <zanzibarian_hamster> this is WAY before star wars innit?
[2:00:21] <+Scevda> Nah this is much earlier.
[2:00:26] <%Nationaleyebrow> this movie is sooo historic
[2:00:30] <+Scevda> Robot Johns is kind of famous.
[2:00:49] <zanzibarian_hamster> So something more like forbidden planet or silent running
[2:00:52] <EuropanLamprey> Because they the people who named them thought they were gods
[2:00:54] <tanarath> Trying to justify a loan from the US Gov? Show space stuff & be "realistic"?
[2:00:54] <Loxoron> This was 1968
[2:00:55] <KaitlynnHere> So many vaginas
[2:01:01] <+KiwiRedgrave> what is the character from?
[2:01:06] <KaitlynnHere> The entire planet is one big vagina
[2:01:12] <%KellBeII> it reads like a teenager wrote it
[2:01:32] <+RealThiele> someones apollo mission fan fiction
[2:01:52] <EuropanLamprey> I like how the trip to Venus is just a quick jaunt and not a year long journey where John has already eaten the other crewmembers and fucked all the bitches
[2:01:57] <rdddy> making a fist with those claws is like self mutilation no?
[2:02:00] <whittacre> "We were all definitely in space!"
[2:02:07] <+KiwiRedgrave> nice, weighty, and solid
[2:02:12] <KaitlynnHere> On the butt? They missed the vag
[2:02:20] <Samex_Comex> I had to go move furniture, my arms feel like noodles
[2:02:21] <+RealThiele> pan for women

[2:02:37] <Loxoron> “Venus is like what, 50 miles away?”
[2:03:04] <+PleasantLee> its been like 20 minutes and I havent seen 1 prehistoric woman wearing a leopard print loin cloth knock a man out and drag him away to a cave
[2:03:12] <%Pappajimbo> in space he who smelt it delt it

[2:03:14] <tanarath> Siren song of space waif
[2:03:15] <+RealThiele> close encounters of the booba kind
[2:03:18] <%Bluwizard21> that shoulda been the title "Space Skanks"!
[2:03:29] <Dunmarkh> @PleasantLee maybe this movie was clickbait

[2:19:39] <rdddy> obey you?
[2:19:43] <Loxoron> They’re doing more for John right now than they didn’t for trying to contact them earlier
[2:19:46] <CyberDingus> PixelBob ''Fuck off flesh bags, this is my planet now. All these babes belong to me''
[2:19:46] <+KnifeyMcEdge> @KellBeII Space Rodan and Space Sirens
[2:20:03] <+RealThiele> Good ol' square 40
[2:20:04] <QuestionmarkTimes2> I fucking adore plague but hate furries and weebs. Please advise
[2:20:26] <+PleasantLee> one bit of trivia on the imdb for the brain that wouldnt die is - When the blonde and brunette stripper start wrestling, the camera pans to pictures of cats on the wall to show that they are having a "catfight."
[2:20:27] <%Nationaleyebrow> John obeys no human
[2:20:28] <rdddy> @QuestionmarkTimes2 go to venus

[2:21:12] <tanarath> It really does
[2:21:17] <%Nationaleyebrow> i guess plague likes brains over prehistoric women
[2:21:19] <Loxoron> So they didn’t preprogrammed John with any diagnostic skill either, they really just brought a cool robot cause he was cool
[2:21:21] <CyberDingus> PixelBob John is too big
[2:21:24] <Coystick> Is Robot John doing drugs?

[2:23:41] <cptkraut> such smooth cuts
[2:23:50] <+PleasantLee> this movie should be called "the planet where incompetent male astronauts go"
[2:23:55] <Dunmarkh> yeah, god is dead now
[2:24:01] <Coystick> "some trash just washed up"
[2:24:03] <Incrodon> "Look, god is dead, fucking idiot"
[2:24:04] <rdddy> rubbergod is dead oh no

[2:24:33] <QuestionmarkTimes2> is this a bloodborne prequel ?
[2:24:37] <%Explodincatz> Plague the Prophet
[2:24:38] <lewdnekojam> our god was a rubber ducky all along
[2:24:40] <@Nightbot> @FingaLights -> How barbaric. [stop spamming symbols] [warning]
[2:24:42] <+Scevda> We should definitely eat him.
[2:24:46] <%Bluwizard21> they have some nice clothes and shoes for prehistoric women
[2:24:56] <cptkraut> god feels so rubbery
[2:24:58] <%Nationaleyebrow> now space gojira can rise
[2:24:58] <GaboLinV> Pretty small for a god
[2:25:01] <Dunmarkh> If that's god what the fuck do they think a demon is?
[2:25:04] <TheLordOfTheScrubs> god has no bones, apparently
[2:25:04] <Coystick> This is the citizen kane of movies
[2:25:20] <%FingaLights> Water must be cold, he shrunk
[2:25:28] <Incrodon> @Dunmarkh Same thing but the colours are inverted
[2:25:29] <+Scevda> Return his latex to the ground of Venus.
[2:25:29] <rdddy> so venus is populated by a bunch of abba reject mermaids i see
[2:25:46] <GaboLinV> Are you up to date with one piece?
[2:25:59] <%Pappajimbo> To be fair most of our myths are about gods being assholes
[2:26:15] <%Nationaleyebrow> prehistoric rodan
[2:26:18] <rdddy> illuminati
[2:26:19] <Zarender> Reptile? This must be the work of Shao Khan.
[2:26:23] <Loxoron> These guys are just privateers
[2:26:33] <+RealThiele> :V
[2:26:49] <lemoan> HARHARHAR
[2:26:50] <Loxoron> Feels like they wanted a pirate movie then just made it in space
[2:26:58] <rdddy> stop rolling ur eyes plague
[2:26:59] <tanarath> Look Plague, Elon Musk isn't going to pay they, they have to pillage for their 7.50 an hour.
[2:27:05] <lewdnekojam> time for an upgrade plauge
[2:27:07] <+Scevda> I must consult the Elder Warps!
[2:27:14] <CyberDingus> PixelBob Eli underestimates women again
[2:27:17] <Samex_Comex> Man the ghosts just keep wooing
[2:27:20] <cptkraut> lets pray to god for better fitting wigs

[2:27:28] <TheLordOfTheScrubs> she has a prehistoric chefs hat
[2:27:32] <tanarath> Chef hat
[2:27:41] <lemoan> Why is this whole movie dubbed over?
[2:27:50] <@Nightbot> Plague is a youtube animator and also streams at https://picarto.tv/Plague . Also: t-shirts! http://goo.gl/lze8QO
[2:27:56] <+RealThiele> search for space booba
[2:28:05] <rdddy> hat made of tinfoil so the demons cant read her mind
[2:28:21] <Loxoron> That was just Ultros

[2:29:20] <Pixel_Butts> maaaaan this movie sucks LOL
[2:29:24] <%Bluwizard21> this is the most interesting thing ive watched since paint
[2:29:27] <rdddy> did he drop a badge?
[2:29:42] <jaypeesan> is Venus in Sweden?
[2:29:48] <%caramello_man> They took him out of the sea just to throw him back in
[2:29:49] <+PleasantLee> I think this movie is proof that you can get budget for anything if you tell them that you'll put hot women in it
[2:29:49] <lewdnekojam> yup
[2:29:53] <TheLordOfTheScrubs> that's not the soundtrack that's just the foley guy screaming in agony that he's attached to this film
[2:30:01] <lemoan> Why the fuck are they all bleach blonde
[2:30:01] <Dunmarkh> The same could be said of all religions.
[2:30:26] <+RealThiele> some say space rodan is still floating around
[2:30:31] <Loxoron> I wonder if they just let the prop float away into nothing
[2:30:32] <ZComiX> Is the the principal of the matter plague :^)
[2:30:34] <Samex_Comex> Them killing their god was pretty cool
[2:30:36] <Vyskus> idk the tentacle monster was pretty good
[2:30:37] <lemoan> Now I REALLY want some she beasts
[2:30:38] <%JailShmixRemix> this movie has been great! I missed like 30 minutes of it
[2:30:46] <rdddy> he turned into a reptilian person
[2:30:49] <+Scevda> Theres ones red head.
[2:30:55] <+RealThiele> women cant be trust and worship rodan
[2:30:59] <Pixel_Butts> dont kill ancient gods
[2:31:07] <TheLordOfTheScrubs> the message of the film is to not watch the film
[2:31:07] <Ziegsy> Am I back just in time for the women?
[2:31:07] <Loxoron> Robot John has been great for his total 5 minute of screen time
[2:31:30] <rdddy> grill rubber god
[2:31:30] <jaypeesan> Did they just made fire?
[2:31:31] <Zerenis> Robot John for an Oscar when?
[2:31:36] <+Scevda> The sirens call of space exploration is dangerous. Stay happy and humble in soviet paradise.
[2:31:54] <Bennett_Fracture> the flu season is upon us...

[2:32:36] <jaypeesan> if only they brought marshmellows
[2:32:42] <Zerenis> I’m not sure if this whole movie is a joke or not. I don’t think we’ve heard an actual spoken line that wasn’t dubbed
[2:32:49] <Bennett_Fracture> forgive my typographical errors...
[2:32:52] <lewdnekojam> hohohoho!
[2:32:53] <BoneSkore> 4 raiders from BoneSkore have joined!

[2:33:19] <Incrodon> I hope John becomes their new god
[2:33:22] <zanzibarian_hamster> @Zerenis Imagine the original sound with those helmets on
[2:33:22] <Dunmarkh> Wait they're not prehistoric, they had a civilization previously
[2:33:27] <Ziegsy> is this just sci fi or is it supposed to be a horror?
[2:33:32] <BoneSkore> Ahoy Plague! how's the arts going today?
[2:33:43] <Incrodon> @Dunmarkh listen, its not Greek/Roman based so it must be BARBARIAN
[2:33:49] <Dunmarkh> They're post historic, this movie is bullshit
[2:34:07] <Samex_Comex> I love you rock
[2:34:11] <%FingaLights> @Dunmarkh but WE don't have history of them

[2:35:00] <Samex_Comex> Space ghosts

[2:36:43] <Zarender> Burn the witches!
[2:36:46] <Incrodon> As a man, I can confirm, I would die to a small bondfire
[2:36:47] <rdddy> what an eruption
[2:36:56] <Dunmarkh> These prehistoric women are highly submissive and will worship anything they find as a god.

[2:38:02] <Loxoron> No one on earth has ever seen a volcano in this universe
[2:38:07] <viciousgrim> i was hoping for real beast women.

[2:42:12] <Loxoron> All the men must die for killing the true hero of this world
[2:42:33] <+KnifeyMcEdge> its been 3 hours, right?
[2:42:35] <Zerenis> John didn’t even get to use his robo dong!
[2:42:41] <tanarath> I see how it is.
[2:42:52] <rdddy> ive aged like 3 years watching this
[2:42:53] <+PleasantLee> all I wanted was for some astronauts to land on a planet and instantly be assaulted with hundred of thrown spears and then have to survive the search parties of prehistoric women with feminine issues
[2:42:57] <BoneSkore> what a read
[2:43:03] <tanarath> Just leaving John
[2:43:17] <SuperVaderMan> John noooo
[2:43:18] <+Scevda> @pleasantlee it really is as simple as that
[2:43:22] <Samex_Comex> Noooo John!
[2:43:23] <+ThomasOfTroy> Yeah, it was not this
[2:43:30] <%FingaLights> @PleasantLee we all wanted this
[2:43:33] <lemoan> JOOOOOOHHHHNNNN
[2:43:38] <rdddy> ill be back
[2:43:40] <CyberDingus> F
[2:43:43] <+RealThiele> and they never did
[2:43:44] <Zerenis> Yeah they named this movie pooorrrlllyyyy
[2:43:44] <lewdnekojam> we got blue venused
[2:43:44] <+Shaggnar> Basically just that episode of futurama is what I wanted
[2:43:47] <+PleasantLee> "I think I saw a l-l-l-lady
[2:43:52] <Dunmarkh> One guy thought he smelled one
[2:43:52] <Loxoron> John is gonna fuse with their fire god
[2:43:56] <+Scevda> We all have better taste in sci fantasy than cold war era soviets.
[2:43:57] <rdddy> they predicted skynet, boys we saw it here
[2:43:59] <pilllowofbees> theyre not even cannibals
[2:44:01] <Samex_Comex> John died for their stupidity
[2:44:07] <+Risingxiv> this the first clickbait?
[2:44:25] <lemoan> is miss john
[2:44:29] <vladtet909> If I had gone to the movies and seen this in a theater back in the day I would've demanded a refund
[2:44:37] <Samex_Comex> John saved him too
[2:44:47] <+RealThiele> i know my spirit is down after the loss of the best crew member
[2:44:56] <rdddy> praise the jon
[2:45:07] <+Scevda> @vladtet909 dont be so certain. Spectacle was on much shorter supply back then.
[2:45:09] <Loxoron> John should’ve thrown that guy into the lava
[2:45:15] <+ThomasOfTroy> Honestly? A little, yeah
[2:45:20] <HorribleHog> That's when we'll know we've arrived in the future
[2:45:21] <+ThomasOfTroy> That feels super weird
[2:45:22] <BoneSkore> that would make it more exciting!
[2:45:26] <Loxoron> Would’ve made this movie a million times better
[2:45:41] <+RothurThePaladin> Hey Plague! hope all is well sir.
[2:45:59] <lewdnekojam> as long they say it in zack bardagin voice then sure
[2:46:19] <BoneSkore> "rocket ship" is still serious while having just enough whimsy to imply possible space-highjinks
[2:46:21] <wolfen091> yay more plague streams
[2:46:22] <Zerenis> Chances of them leaving the planet without ever interacting with the women?
[2:46:28] <Loxoron> The only thing they did was Lilly rubber pterodactyl god
[2:46:41] <Loxoron> Kill rubber pterodactyl god*
[2:46:48] <rdddy> they found proove wimen were created on venus
[2:46:55] <rdddy> proof*
[2:46:55] <+Scevda> “Just cant close your mind”?
[2:47:00] <Samex_Comex> He really wants them to be lizards
[2:47:06] <Dunmarkh> and then we shot them
[2:47:12] <+PleasantLee> a planet of women who are lizard furries
[2:47:29] <Banedain> Who is Plague drawing?
[2:47:29] <+RealThiele> very fancy
[2:47:31] <+Scevda> @pleasantlee thats scalie
[2:47:31] <Zarender> Cowfee
[2:47:42] <Loxoron> He just wants to fuck a trandoshan, is that too much to ask?
[2:48:00] <lewdnekojam> good prank
[2:48:03] <@Nightbot> Plague is a youtube animator and also streams at https://picarto.tv/Plague . Also: t-shirts! http://goo.gl/lze8QO

[2:48:18] <viciousgrim> glad we help @PlagueOfGripes
[2:48:30] <+PleasantLee> some times you got to fail to move foward.... how many of these shitty movies you got lined up?
[2:48:38] <Samex_Comex> They sleep on the beach like seals
[2:48:49] <lewdnekojam> they took a nap
[2:48:51] <wolfen091> rocks make extra friction
[2:48:53] <Loxoron> They really do just lay there like beaches whales
[2:48:57] <TheLordOfTheScrubs> sunbathing like lizards, hmmm...

[2:53:38] <Ziegsy> god of minor inconveniences
[2:53:38] <lewdnekojam> it is a mighty god
[2:53:51] <mavisgunhound> Frieza should of done this instead
[2:54:02] <Samex_Comex> The space camping trip in canceled

[2:55:53] <pilllowofbees> LUL omg
[2:55:55] <%JailShmixRemix> I'm so dissapointed tbh

[2:56:00] <BoneSkore> and they never returned to whore island
[2:56:00] <Samex_Comex> I guess the lesson don't go to a planet and kill some random god
[2:56:04] <%FingaLights> Come on John
[2:56:07] <rittergeist> That was just a bunch of nothing.

[2:59:15] <sadboy_otoroshi> Are you sure they don't just undergo mitosis or something
[2:59:20] <+RealThiele> reject dinos, embrace robots
[2:59:21] <+KnifeyMcEdge> they predicted that machines would take over a man's job
[2:59:27] <SoFarFetched> plague your vtubers eyes roll so HARD to the back of your head I assume its because of the movie causing that.
[2:59:29] <+PleasantLee> I want johns eyes to light up and and booming voice to say "hey you prehistortic women ever heard of scissoring?"

[3:00:10] <%FingaLights> LOL "Well that was the story
[3:00:15] <Vyskus> "Well, we did everything we could on venus, on to mars"

[3:01:42] <Vyskus> this is going to rule
[3:01:48] <%Bluwizard21> aren't shews those mouse like things with the long noses?
[3:01:49] <Zarender> James Best is best.
[3:01:53] <+PleasantLee> if this movie doesnt have an extreme close up of a shrew screaming with a bloody maw, then it has failed
[3:01:54] <sadboy_otoroshi> Killer name,
[3:01:58] <Tracazoid> Giant killer things have to be good, except when they're not
[3:01:59] <SoFarFetched> ENDLESS TRASH
[3:02:08] <BoneSkore> i thought someone tamed the shrews
[3:02:17] <sadboy_otoroshi> ENDLESS TRASH
[3:02:23] <+Scevda> Giant BLANK is the epitome of trashy movies.
[3:02:23] <SoFarFetched> You just now need a backround for your avatar where its just a pile of bad public domain movies on VHS
[3:02:45] <Samex_Comex> Mmm trash yum yum trash
[3:02:51] <rittergeist> Holy shit, a black man!
[3:02:51] <SoFarFetched> ooooh its holding
[3:02:56] <lemoan> ooooohhhh noooooo
[3:03:01] <+ratchetex> plz don't racist movie
[3:03:03] <+Scevda> Here we go
[3:03:04] <+KnifeyMcEdge> i wonder if he was credited
[3:03:09] <viciousgrim> the boy
[3:03:12] <sadboy_otoroshi> FeelsGoodMan SaltyCorn
[3:03:14] <Tyonidus> LOL jesus
[3:03:40] <lemoan> this bout to be real racist ain't it?
[3:03:40] <+Scevda> So say we all.
[3:03:44] <CyberDingus> PixelBob Be afraid
[3:03:51] <+PleasantLee> he seems alright, I'm optimistic
[3:03:56] <%FingaLights> Only a little racist.
[3:04:00] <cthulu_fearlock> land ho
[3:04:02] <%Explodincatz> oh no he likes jazz
[3:04:03] <+ConLin_Arts_> they seem to be good friends
[3:04:04] <Zerenis> C’mon movie, please don’t go the route we all think you’re gonna
[3:04:09] <lewdnekojam> i give him 45min tops
[3:04:26] <+KnifeyMcEdge> Its a horror movie, right? i might know what happens to him
[3:04:27] <Vyskus> to be fair, 45 minutes is most of the movie
[3:04:27] <viciousgrim> he will be dead soon if this is a horror movie
[3:04:37] <%FingaLights> @Explodincatz well, who DOESN"t like jazz
[3:04:46] <Incrodon> [the Shrews were sadly, also racist]
[3:04:59] <lemoan> @incrodon I KNEW IT
[3:04:59] <+PleasantLee> hes gonna die thats for sure
[3:04:59] <+KnifeyMcEdge> @Incrodon such was the 50s
[3:05:01] <Zarender> @Incrodon laynaWHYTHO
[3:05:07] <%FingaLights> Ye
[3:05:13] <Loxoron> This was 1959 so be ready for it
[3:05:29] <+Scevda> 59? Ahhhhhh shit. Were doomed.
[3:05:29] <+KnifeyMcEdge> its a cool chess piece
[3:05:55] <Zerenis> Rook is easily the best so far
[3:05:57] <%FingaLights> If Rook turns to the actual hero of the movie, 10/10
[3:06:03] <+Scevda> I am reading a fanfiction with Rook as the name of the OC. Shits dope.
[3:06:08] <+ConLin_Arts_> monkaS
[3:06:16] <Samex_Comex> I miss the space woos
[3:06:22] <Zerenis> LUL I wish you were wrong
[3:06:25] <+KnifeyMcEdge> hello BOOBA
[3:06:32] <%Nationaleyebrow> rook ntr when?
[3:06:53] <+Scevda> Hi, ill be objectifying you for the duration of the movie.
[3:06:57] <+PleasantLee> "hey, you're a much better object to look at than the tubby blackman I keep on my ship, you'll do nicely"
[3:06:59] <Loxoron> Is his name Rook Griswald? That’s a good name
[3:07:17] <%Bluwizard21> he is gonna die
[3:07:17] <%caramello_man> Rook dies first
[3:07:18] <+KnifeyMcEdge> i seen the eye roll lol
[3:07:22] <%FingaLights> Oh no
[3:07:30] <%Bluwizard21> he is gonna die and he's gonna say Aw Lawd
[3:07:30] <+PleasantLee> the rook part is only slightly iffy
[3:07:34] <+Scevda> Hes gonna die though.
[3:07:39] <TheLordOfTheScrubs> rook split off from the pack, good games
[3:07:47] <Tyonidus> HURRICUN
[3:07:55] <+Scevda> Its a fence!
[3:07:59] <+ratchetex> he probably dies early or saves him late in the movie
[3:08:02] <Zerenis> Rook either dies first or is the only survivor
[3:08:12] <Loxoron> Rook walks off screen and shows back up at the end to be the hero, that’s my head cannon
[3:08:15] <+KnifeyMcEdge> Jerry Seinfield
[3:08:22] <$studleydoorite> that is where characters come from
[3:08:28] <%caramello_man> its a mexican
[3:08:31] <+KnifeyMcEdge> OH NOOOOO
[3:08:33] <Vyskus> we'll have your what
[3:08:33] <Zerenis> My assistant, Mr. E Ville
[3:08:39] <Ziegsy> i think this is all the characters
[3:08:43] <Tyonidus> When Plague said "uh-oh" I snorted drink through my nose.
[3:08:45] <lemoan> oooohh nnopoooooooo
[3:08:45] <SoFarFetched> they need the token minority characters so they can say its diverse? geefThink
[3:08:47] <cthulu_fearlock> drink everyday
[3:08:47] <Tyonidus> it burns
[3:08:48] <Dunmarkh> It was the style of the time
[3:08:50] <%sparklinghallow> That's a great headcannon @Loxoron, I like it.
[3:08:51] <TheLordOfTheScrubs> "you thought it was black guy who was gonna be the racist stereotype, BUT IT WAS ME, SENOR STEREOTYPE!"
[3:08:57] <%Explodincatz> the normal
[3:09:03] <rittergeist> Damn, this movie's diverse/
[3:09:07] <cthulu_fearlock> house elves
[3:09:10] <+Scevda> The help was a class of people…ya.
[3:09:14] <%Bluwizard21> you're lucky it's low key at this point.
[3:09:23] <%caramello_man> love interest?
[3:09:36] <Loxoron> They don’t want you to feel safe from the racism while watching this
[3:09:42] <Ziegsy> people wore alot of outfits back then
[3:09:43] <Zarender> @TheLordOfTheScrubs LUL
[3:10:11] <Ziegsy> planet of the prehistoric shrews
[3:10:13] <%FingaLights> They probably regular sized Shrews, just murderous
[3:10:15] <cthulu_fearlock> they had to stick to the cannon of the cinematic universe
[3:10:18] <+KnifeyMcEdge> i keep hearing "giant shrooms" and im getting Dark Souls flashbacks
[3:10:24] <lemoan> I WANT MY PREHISTORIC SHREW WOMEN
[3:10:35] <Zerenis> Breed?
[3:10:38] <Zerenis> Oh nooooo
[3:10:38] <Loxoron> A shrew Vtuber
[3:10:53] <+Scevda> What the they made them? Why?
[3:10:55] <sadboy_otoroshi> Breed?
[3:11:05] <%FingaLights> I see it
[3:11:10] <vladtet909> RIP
[3:11:12] <Incrodon> @Scevda COMPLETE, GLOBAL, SHREWIFICATION
[3:11:16] <+PleasantLee> the captain looks like norm?
[3:11:22] <+ratchetex> oh no
[3:11:24] <cthulu_fearlock> it's his dad
[3:11:25] <%caramello_man> His name is sherman? I only paid attention to rook
[3:11:29] <+Scevda> @incrodon how shrewd of them.
[3:11:33] <+PleasantLee> hmm, a little I guess
[3:11:48] <vladtet909> The Captains name is secretly Turd Ferguson
[3:11:57] <+Scevda> Ahhh, metabolism. Thats why.
[3:12:00] <EuropanLamprey> Oh, this meme again
[3:12:01] <Banedain> Truly the first Thanos
[3:12:09] <+Scevda> Hes trying to make elves of us.
[3:12:09] <+KnifeyMcEdge> shrews are gonna kidnap the woman and make her their queen, i can feel it
[3:12:15] <+TDotGoat> sure thing, captain
[3:12:17] <DimBulb999> i was thinking charlie sheen for some reason
[3:12:18] <lewdnekojam> the doctor wants to turn the world into manlets!
[3:12:21] <Zarender> Oh captain, my captain.
[3:12:22] <Ziegsy> you lack the hat
[3:12:24] <masheshardest> ok chef
[3:12:25] <%FingaLights> Oh Captain, my Captain
[3:12:25] <Zerenis> Captain Gripes?
[3:12:26] <Ranko2Danko> oh captain my captain
[3:12:27] <+Grossly_Incandescent_> you got it captian
[3:12:29] <+Scevda> Sure chief
[3:12:31] <CoreY_M__> YAMATO 4 STRAWHAT atpChar
[3:12:32] <lewdnekojam> oh captain my captain
[3:12:33] <EuropanLamprey> Eli, Captain of the Gripe Pirates
[3:12:34] <Daxalog> Plague Captain sounds like a warhammer unit
[3:12:41] <Erwin_Dedic> Okay, cap'n.
[3:12:41] <%chainedwolfstress> Cap'n
[3:12:43] <%Explodincatz> oh captain my captain
[3:12:46] <cptkraut> i am the hurricane
[3:12:51] <Dunmarkh> Plague captain sounds like a skaven unit
[3:13:09] <atgithursdays> Plague are you gonna watch the undertale thing?
[3:13:13] <Samex_Comex> Captain has to go down with the ship
[3:13:16] <impulse255dj> The dread pirate Plague.
[3:13:17] <+Scevda> @dunmarkh dead on!
[3:13:17] <Zerenis> Would Captain Gripes Devil fruit power be that anyone who hears him complain about something becomes depressed and unmotivated?
[3:13:41] <Daxalog> Out of left field
[3:13:43] <wolfen091> meh
[3:13:44] <EuropanLamprey> @Zerenis That's already a Devil Fruit
[3:13:46] <SuperVaderMan> I thought it was funny they were announcing "new" games and immediately opened with a remake
[3:13:47] <%FingaLights> Could be cool?
[3:13:48] <%Explodincatz> is that teh star war?
[3:13:48] <lewdnekojam> there was a remake?
[3:13:49] <cptkraut> slightly optimistic
[3:13:56] <Banedain> Wish remakes stayed in collections IE it needs 2 with it
[3:13:58] <tanarath> Remade by EA? It's probably going to such
[3:13:59] <DimBulb999> changed from office garb to dance party
[3:14:02] <Zerenis> I’m hesitantly excited. Hopefully it ends up good
[3:14:03] <tanarath> suck*
[3:14:03] <+Scevda> Aspyr has a growing positive rep. So we shall see.
[3:14:07] <CoreY_M__> og gameplay is shite. so hopefully its a proper remake like FF7
[3:14:16] <Loxoron> Idk, the studio behind it has never done anything big before so I’m a bit worried
[3:14:19] <$studleydoorite> maybe every media company should just earmark everything they're NOT remaking
[3:14:31] <+PleasantLee> that dork in the glasses is really trying to be a dork
[3:14:35] <+Scevda> Ratford is his name? Lol
[3:14:39] <Ziegsy> and kh 4
[3:14:42] <Daxalog> 9 was which one?
[3:14:43] <Frogwash> Fear
[3:14:45] <Banedain> FF 9 is getting a cartoon so it could be a tie in
[3:14:46] <+PleasantLee> hmm, ff9 remake. not sure how I feel about that
[3:14:46] <+Scevda> Why 9?
[3:14:47] <%FingaLights> And Chrono Cross
[3:14:51] <Zerenis> We’ll see about that. Aren’t they still releasing that cartoon aimed at children for FF9?
[3:14:54] <tubit> 9 is the one with Vivi
[3:14:57] <CoreY_M__> ff9 over 6? i thought they would go to 6 next
[3:15:04] <EuropanLamprey> The Time Jannies
[3:15:15] <Loxoron> The time Kuja
[3:15:17] <tubit> I like 9
[3:15:19] <Ziegsy> a plot that wasnt star wars?
[3:15:20] <whittacre> I totally forgot about the cartoon
[3:15:31] <+PleasantLee> if 9 got remade, it'd be nice if it did a better job of ending some characters arcs
[3:15:38] <+starhammer_games> anyone else have low fps in the stream
[3:15:38] <Samex_Comex> Give us the shrews
[3:15:40] <@Nightbot> @TheLordOfTheScrubs -> You are the missing link. Goodbye. [stop spamming symbols] [warning]
[3:15:41] <EuropanLamprey> Judging by the last two movies, they were afraid of science
[3:15:43] <renyrells> the irish
[3:15:54] <+Scevda> Vermin! The terror!
[3:16:03] <lewdnekojam> the spooks are from the cinematography
[3:16:18] <Loxoron> Now the horror is genetic modification
[3:16:20] <+Scevda> Lol
[3:16:24] <%sparklinghallow> It is, I have it on a cheap horror collection box set
[3:16:24] <TheLordOfTheScrubs> it was worth
[3:16:42] <+Scevda> Rook is dead already.
[3:16:48] <%FingaLights> Sadly probably ^
[3:16:54] <Loxoron> They should make a movie with Robot John and Rook
[3:16:56] <Samex_Comex> Time to get drunk with the shrews
[3:17:02] <Dunmarkh> I don't think the shrews can swim, maybe rook is fine
[3:17:04] <SuperVaderMan> Marriioooooo
[3:17:11] <Ziegsy> a chicken can reduce a muse to teeth in about 7 seconds. where my horror movie about chickens?
[3:17:13] <%Bluwizard21> best espanol
[3:17:14] <Ziegsy> Mouse
[3:17:26] <+Scevda> He says mario like Pat. IE, WRONG!
[3:18:23] <+starhammer_games> sheeeshh
[3:18:26] <Loxoron> Cause it’s the 50’s and he’s white
[3:18:34] <Dunmarkh> oh hey it's rook

[3:18:39] <Banedain> Rooks deaders AF
[3:18:39] <+Scevda> Rook!
[3:18:40] <+starhammer_games> likeable protagonist < Asshole prataonist
[3:18:47] <Zerenis> Yeah this captain is a bit of a douche
[3:18:53] <%sparklinghallow> hey look, it's Rook
[3:18:56] <Zerenis> Nowhere cool as Captain Gripes
[3:18:59] <cptkraut> slowly the racism creeped into the movie like a shrew stalkingits prey
[3:19:02] <%FingaLights> @Ziegsy Poultrygeist: Night of the Chicken Dead. Just googled it. Idk, could be great
[3:19:04] <Zarender> MrDestructoid

[3:19:33] <Loxoron> This guy is the worst
[3:19:36] <Dunmarkh> Believe me, I am an irresponsible drunk
[3:19:37] <$studleydoorite> yeah stop calling him that, he knows
[3:19:53] <%sparklinghallow> well at least he knows
[3:19:57] <+Shadow_Jager> believe him that he is an irresponsible drunk is that what he said?
[3:20:16] <cthulu_fearlock> you didn't notice but your brain did
[3:20:22] <+Scevda> Believe hes tired. But hes an idiot so who knows.
[3:20:33] <+starhammer_games> @PlagueOfGripes will you ever make an instagram? For people who dont like Twitter

[3:26:25] <$TheMightyElosan> What movie is this?
[3:26:29] <Samex_Comex> Thanks for telling us about the GIANT SHREWS!
[3:26:35] <%FingaLights> Only a bit like a slideshow
[3:26:49] <$studleydoorite> "big as a full grown wolf" and they used rat terriers or something LUL
[3:26:58] <+Scevda> They all have completely forgotten about Rook.
[3:27:00] <Zarender> Come on, OBS. Do it for Rook.
[3:27:04] <%FingaLights> Didn't say shit to Rook
[3:27:26] <%FingaLights> I can't tell those two apart
[3:27:42] <$studleydoorite> Ant Man will ride his silver surfboard back in time and save Rook, I totally watched Endgame
[3:27:44] <tanarath> Yeah, J E R R Y, that's enough.
[3:27:48] <@Nightbot> Plague is a youtube animator and also streams at https://picarto.tv/Plague . Also: t-shirts! http://goo.gl/lze8QO
[3:27:58] <+Scevda> Me neither @fingalights
[3:28:18] <Zarender> "Your hairline is abnormal!" fleshyySmug
[3:28:20] <%SolidSpiderZnake> monkaS
[3:28:27] <tanarath> Negative characteristics, I guess.
[3:28:42] <lewdnekojam> maybe the good doctor had divorce and thought it was funny call them shrews
[3:28:47] <pilllowofbees> directors father was eaten by shrews
[3:28:50] <+Scevda> Because of their metabolism characteristics @plagueofgripes
[3:28:53] <%SolidSpiderZnake> is this Dark Souls origins?

[3:29:31] <%SolidSpiderZnake> they cut the power... hiw did they cut the power they are just animals maaaan
[3:29:32] <EuropanLamprey> because who else is making movies about shrews?
[3:29:35] <$studleydoorite> probably hadn't been done before
[3:29:51] <+Scevda> Probably because rats and mice were already made movies.
[3:29:51] <+whyskeywolfe> That’s easy - because they had access to shrews.
[3:29:54] <Samex_Comex> Maybe there are a bunch of rodent teams and they got team shrew
[3:29:56] <+ConLin_Arts_> Oh is this the killer shrews movie Ashens has talked about?
[3:30:22] <%SolidSpiderZnake> plot twist plague wasn't streaming cys of the shrews
