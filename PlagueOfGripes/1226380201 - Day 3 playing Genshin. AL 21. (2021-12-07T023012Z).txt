[0:01:03] <Julkson> Hallo Papa
[0:01:22] <TheButtravage> @PlagueOfGripes Don't fall into the trap my man.
[0:01:23] <Daiguiny> Heyyy gripes
[0:02:05] <whittacre> sup plague
[0:02:38] <TheButtravage> Why are you playing Genshin anyway?  Wasn't something I expected from you.
[0:03:06] <Hazard_Kujacker> Doin fine, thanks for asking :3
[0:03:07] <%Murphio_GS> plagueTaps plagueTaps plagueTaps
[0:03:15] <hollowedsilence> Doing alright
[0:03:17] <%KellBeII> plagueTaps
[0:03:20] <%KellBeII> hey eli
[0:03:33] <Jakerham_Lincoln> Plague has his warm pants on shits getting real
[0:03:47] <%KellBeII> its very noticeable on your hat
[0:03:50] <whittacre> nifty, dark side plague
[0:03:52] <%JayCantDo> JayCantDo subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 15 months! 15 months nice and some genshin sweet
[0:04:26] <%Murphio_GS> plagueNYA
[0:04:49] <Larva_The_Masked> my bad if i spammed a message i had to restart twitch
[0:05:10] <%Murphio_GS> Sounds like a mistranslation of Josef or something
[0:05:10] <TheButtravage> @PlagueOfGripes Sorry, I know this is unrelated but I was gong through your old streams.  Would you ever go back to Dragon's Dogma on stream again?
[0:05:10] <%KellBeII> oh only one or two you say?
[0:05:11] <xeros720> i'm surprised you don't have more
[0:05:17] <xeros720> well it has only been 3 days
[0:06:08] <TheButtravage> There isn't a lot of substance for the writing. Gameplay is decent BoTW rip off.
[0:06:23] <Larva_The_Masked> I have never played this but is the writing that bad?
[0:06:25] <Daiguiny> She’s food
[0:06:28] <%Murphio_GS> So,... a loli plagueFear
[0:06:32] <Jakerham_Lincoln> If the characters had personality you might not want to collect and fantasize over them in your sweaty, suspiciously sticky waifu basement
[0:06:35] <The_Slag_Bag> I hate her crossing bangs
[0:06:37] <The_Slag_Bag> so much
[0:07:02] <TheButtravage> @Larva_The_Masked It's not abysmal, just kind of generic anime writing.
[0:07:15] <xeros720> that's them sort of faking it for multiple languages
[0:07:24] <TheButtravage> Yeah, they don't try to match lip flaps.
[0:07:33] <xeros720> i think mihoyo even targets jp VA first
[0:07:36] <CaptainGreenbeans> fly swatter the bug/fairy girl
[0:07:42] <KohryuZX> Honkai is better written than Genshin, (i have played both i dropped genshin after a year and now i play only honkai but thats mostly due to gameplay than story itself)
[0:07:50] <%SilverRoddo> The heck, Zubaz?!
[0:08:01] <xeros720> yeah, the archetype
[0:08:04] <Daiguiny> They act like anime characters
[0:08:12] <Daiguiny> NotLikeThis
[0:08:15] <TheButtravage> I think the designs are decent, body types are not varied though.
[0:08:25] <2_pound_dump> They look like me
[0:08:38] <Daiguiny> All the chatacters looks almost the same for me
[0:08:40] <xeros720> that's why people care abou the next character, Itto, a lot, he'll have a new one body type
[0:08:44] <TheButtravage> Yeah, very lacking in body disparity for playable characters.
[0:08:57] <CaptainGreenbeans> they're all sickly
[0:08:59] <+kachucho> sup plague, hope you are enjoying this game
[0:09:22] <The_Slag_Bag> That's most games
[0:09:23] <Julkson> It reminds me of some anime style drawing where to draw an old person, they just take the generic model and paste a gray mustache or beard, and it looks weird
[0:09:30] <%whimwhisp> Isn't that you with uh 75% of games?
[0:09:46] <%SilverRoddo> They probably got a high metabolism to be that thin.  It’s super hard for me to gain any muscle.
[0:09:49] <KohryuZX> my biggest issue with the game itself is that they almost all play the same, there's not enough difference from a lance wielder to another lance wielder
[0:09:52] <TheButtravage> Genshin isn't a game I can recommend, esepcially once you are out of content it turns into a daily chore like most F2P games do.
[0:10:02] <Daiguiny> Squid1 Squid3 Squid2 Squid4
[0:10:03] <@Nightbot> Plague is a youtube animator and also streams at https://picarto.tv/Plague . Also: t-shirts! http://goo.gl/lze8QO
[0:10:05] <cap_bon> I hate her voice
[0:10:16] <+kachucho> @cap_bon it's the dub
[0:10:32] <The_Slag_Bag> I feel like if you squeeze her her eys would bug out like those old squeezy stress toys
[0:10:38] <TheButtravage> I just run the JP dub since I'm a disgusting weeb.
[0:10:40] <cap_bon> Are there any big muscular ladies in the game ?
[0:10:49] <xeros720> we can only dream
[0:10:58] <+kachucho> @thebuttravage the way God intended
[0:10:59] <xeros720> technically Eula really and it's all in her butt
[0:10:59] <KohryuZX> @cap_bon the japanese dub is way better they use all star japanese voice casting
[0:11:02] <+GardenHills> What if they just didnt have VA
[0:11:09] <Daiguiny> Do you like the gameplay in general plague?
[0:11:10] <TheButtravage> @cap_bon Not in terms of physical applearance, some of them have the personality though.
[0:11:44] <TheButtravage> @cap_bon Beidou for example would fit that character type, but her model is still noodle armed.
[0:11:47] <fruit_pie_the_magician> "writing"
[0:12:06] <cap_bon> truely a missed opportunity
[0:12:11] <fruit_pie_the_magician> The gameplay is mostly inoffensive
[0:12:12] <CaptainGreenbeans> eww...
[0:12:23] <TheButtravage> I honestly think Genshin does everything worse than BoTW outside of combat.
[0:12:25] <Daiguiny> Oh no
[0:12:34] <+kachucho> a genuine loving father figure? that's so gay!!
[0:12:38] <fruit_pie_the_magician> but the story and writing and mission design are fucking TRASH
[0:12:41] <The_Slag_Bag> I think that's a dress
[0:12:44] <The_Slag_Bag> Not junk
[0:12:51] <TheButtravage> @PlagueOfGripes Part of that might be the outfit she wears.
[0:12:53] <%JayCantDo> Midna got that dump truck
[0:12:56] <%SilverRoddo> I had the NiS Asian/English dub of Cardcaptor Sakura on in the background, i often wondered who was talking, because they sounded too similar.
[0:12:59] <+GardenHills> there has to be poop in there
[0:13:00] <CaptainGreenbeans> Where's Guts???
[0:13:02] <%eldercat> The
[0:13:20] <cap_bon> The generic lookin guys kinda remind me of RWBY
[0:13:22] <+daveronald> midna is way more shortshack
[0:13:27] <TheButtravage> Yeah, Imp Midna is all hips.
[0:13:47] <Daiguiny> Midna hips?
[0:13:53] <cap_bon> w i d e
[0:13:58] <TheButtravage> @cap_bon I agree, the background characters in Genshin could absolutely fit in RWBY.
[0:14:03] <fruit_pie_the_magician> They have like 3 npc models
[0:14:10] <splicerss> it happened
[0:14:12] <Daiguiny> Kappa
[0:14:13] <splicerss> hes finally a furry
[0:14:14] <%Murphio_GS> blob
[0:14:34] <+tyler274> is this the ffxiv queue waiting room?
[0:14:38] <The_Slag_Bag> I'm just thinking of vinesauce joel
[0:14:42] <vehementvadr> it's kinda damning on humanity that beauty by anime standards is just removing features
[0:14:49] <%eldercat> The constellations in Paimon's are a bit distracting.
[0:15:00] <+crowmium> this is what you get for using English voices
[0:15:17] <fruit_pie_the_magician> They're not doing it to make them look good, theyre doing it because they're lazy as piss and don't want to use more than the like 4 non-gatcha character models
[0:15:17] <+johnathanjoester> are you playing this for a video by any chance?
[0:15:18] <TheButtravage> @PlagueOfGripes In terms of gameplay or character writing?
[0:15:29] <+kachucho> @vehementvadr  good proportions are beautiful
[0:15:35] <fruit_pie_the_magician> the only other way they distinguish them is with hair color and facial hair
[0:15:48] <TheButtravage> There's like one or two characters I think you would like @PlagueOfGripes  or at least be fine with.
[0:15:50] <xeros720> the best characters are 5 stars, it's a real problem
[0:15:58] <The_Slag_Bag> He sounds drunk
[0:16:03] <+kachucho> i mean look at every female ghibli character, only hairstyle changes
[0:16:05] <The_Slag_Bag> Reckless Drunk
[0:16:06] <xeros720> hopefully the next landmass has some characters you like
[0:16:10] <+DragonArt07> At least Zhongli sounds good
[0:16:17] <cap_bon> but the acutal gameplays good right?
[0:16:29] <TheButtravage> And again, I'm assuming you are referring to character writing and not gameplay, if you mind clearing that up.
[0:16:41] <%SilverRoddo> Goggles are cool
[0:17:03] <The_Slag_Bag> Kids are dumb and smart
[0:17:06] <itsdasteve> oh, his name has the word "serf" in it, how clever
[0:17:08] <fruit_pie_the_magician> Fucking snowmen weight like 400 pounds
[0:17:09] <+kachucho> kids aware of shame LUL LUL
[0:17:11] <The_Slag_Bag> In stupids ways
[0:17:24] <+wizard_of_diamonds> The cringe
[0:17:41] <itsdasteve> his name is literally "Joe the serf"
[0:17:42] <The_Maddness> scary
[0:17:49] <+wizard_of_diamonds> Don't mention it. EVER.
[0:17:55] <+johnathanjoester> lmao doesnt even look at the protag
[0:17:58] <cap_bon> Just pour this industrial adhesive on your snow man its fine
[0:17:59] <Daiguiny> Damn plague
[0:18:04] <+kachucho> i'm pretty sure half of the cringe is due to the dub
[0:18:07] <+wizard_of_diamonds> I love how you can kind of see bunny girl's ass poking out from her shortsd
[0:18:11] <%JovianGargoyle> Dad? He's like ten years older than you.
[0:18:22] <+kachucho> @joviangargoyle still possible Kappa
[0:18:23] <fruit_pie_the_magician> "How can I ever repay you for defying the laws of thermodynamics"
[0:18:25] <The_Slag_Bag> They gonna fuck
[0:18:33] <TheButtravage> I actually like Amber and her design even though she's garbage.
[0:18:56] <cap_bon> He looks like hes 30ish
[0:19:16] <%Heart0fInk> Heart0fInk subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 4 months, currently on a 3 month streak! I HAVE ACTUAL INTERNET NOW!
[0:19:30] <%Heart0fInk> I Can Watch This Shit!
[0:19:31] <fruit_pie_the_magician> "Sorry sir, your sandwich fell in the deep fryer! Ow! Ow! Ow!"
[0:19:36] <Daiguiny> There are babys in genshin?
[0:20:02] <%Heart0fInk> 16 MBPS baby!
[0:20:05] <itsdasteve> would you like to draw a snowmaaaan?
[0:20:11] <%ItalianWaifu> hi plague hows gambling simulator
[0:20:24] <xeros720> you do stuff and get primos and upgrade materials
[0:20:25] <%Heart0fInk> upgrade from my 1MBPS
[0:20:25] <TheButtravage> @PlagueOfGripes Genshin has a lot of filler web events in between major events.
[0:20:45] <+wizard_of_diamonds> The voices are WutFace
[0:20:53] <+wizard_of_diamonds> FFfffuck make it stop
[0:20:56] <%ItalianWaifu> oh god her voice is glass to my mind
[0:21:03] <CaptainGreenbeans> what the fuck??
[0:21:07] <%eldercat> What?
[0:21:09] <TheButtravage> @PlagueOfGripes They basically exist to drip feed primogems to the community to shut them the fuck up.
[0:21:10] <KohryuZX> all the pointless quests remind me why i dropped genshin and switched to Honkai
[0:21:11] <cap_bon> make her stop
[0:21:15] <Tempmael> like nails on chalkboard
[0:21:15] <xeros720> Covid was rough on the VA
[0:21:19] <%Heart0fInk> Just vore the thing. she's into that or something right?
[0:21:24] <TheButtravage> @PlagueOfGripes Just change to Chinese or Japanese then lol.
[0:21:32] <fruit_pie_the_magician> Jesus christ at least when you switch the language to japanese its less cringe inducing
[0:21:33] <CaptainGreenbeans> Mellow out the uwu-voice
[0:21:37] <WaxWitch> this girl names Navi seem pleasant
[0:21:44] <WaxWitch> makes*
[0:22:00] <Daiguiny> Kinda??
[0:22:04] <xeros720> yeah, you beat it i think
[0:22:04] <+kachucho> i can assure you for some reason the jp voices are less cringy
[0:22:07] <xeros720> it's only 4 parts
[0:22:16] <fruit_pie_the_magician> She sounds kinda similar, but it's less grating somehow
[0:22:19] <cap_bon> wait are you a girl or a hot guy I cant tell
[0:22:21] <TheButtravage> Top quest in your list is more of that event.
[0:22:22] <+kachucho> may be because cheese dialogues are more common in anime
[0:22:33] <%whimwhisp> Should have hunted down fidgets VA. Same sort of character considerably less annoying. Mousey.
[0:22:37] <TheButtravage> @cap_bon He's the male player character.
[0:22:48] <%Heart0fInk> How many sonic character commissions?
[0:22:53] <TheButtravage> It's not really a co op game.
[0:22:53] <cap_bon> *squints* Ok Ill take your word for it
[0:23:02] <TheButtravage> Co op is very limited.
[0:23:08] <xeros720> yeah, like the dandelions and stuff
[0:23:10] <+wizard_of_diamonds> Awesome LUL
[0:23:13] <%Heart0fInk> Oh.. lovely..
[0:23:14] <xeros720> since they are used to ascend
[0:23:17] <+kachucho> can you pvp here??
[0:23:21] <CaptainGreenbeans> fucking hate crafting
[0:23:27] <fruit_pie_the_magician> Co op works by joining another person's world and it limits you to two characters
[0:23:30] <xeros720> mostly just combat
[0:23:31] <TheButtravage> @kachucho No pvp
[0:23:34] <xeros720> since everyone gets the drops
[0:23:39] <+kachucho> @thebuttravage  :(
[0:23:52] <fruit_pie_the_magician> Yeah basically you can farm
[0:23:55] <JacklongKondur> >.> <.<
[0:24:08] <TheButtravage> Oh, the laylines, yes.
[0:24:18] <TheButtravage> You can do anything that spends resin in coop.
[0:24:25] <xeros720> ^
[0:24:32] <fruit_pie_the_magician> The resin limits the amount of basically ANYTHING you can do that's in any way useful
[0:24:35] <xeros720> it's mostly to make resin related things easier
[0:24:40] <TheButtravage> Genshin doesn't seem built for a co op experience.
[0:24:49] <TheButtravage> Like less so than Dark Souls.
[0:24:49] <xeros720> some of the domains are a real pain in the ass, so coop can really help
[0:24:53] <xeros720> but there's no real reason to hang out
[0:24:55] <+kachucho> even monster hoonter has decent co op
[0:25:06] <%Heart0fInk> Wow.. all blond huh?
[0:25:11] <%Heart0fInk> gross
[0:25:17] <+kachucho> @heart0fink do you even plague bruh??
[0:25:17] <fruit_pie_the_magician> Because heals
[0:25:26] <Daiguiny> Kappa Kappa Kappa Kappa
[0:25:39] <%SilverRoddo> I assume guitar girl is behind a paywall.
[0:25:40] <blerrger19> Looks like what I'm doing with 5-stars
[0:25:44] <fruit_pie_the_magician> They kind of suck
[0:25:48] <xeros720> eh, that shit you don't have to worry about
[0:25:54] <xeros720> they are talking about max level
[0:25:54] <blerrger19> Zhong Li is just a 5-star shield buff, and I'm still using Barbara for healing xD
[0:26:04] <fruit_pie_the_magician> Yeah, geo battery + traversal
[0:26:15] <TheButtravage> @PlagueOfGripes So yeah, a lot of characters are built to specific roles, commonly DPS, off field DPS, support, healer, etc.
[0:26:21] <Gmanblue> how goes the genshin
[0:26:22] <fruit_pie_the_magician> you can put that thing on the side of cliffs and stand on it to regain stamina
[0:26:41] <TheButtravage> I honestly prefer travelers Anemo.
[0:26:57] <blerrger19> Anemo is the "works with anything" element
[0:27:04] <Andele1503> Except Geo
[0:27:22] <fruit_pie_the_magician> It's really just rock paper scissors with fire ice and water, and geo and electric and anemo are mostly seperate
[0:27:25] <blerrger19> because geo is the "inert" element
[0:27:51] <blerrger19> electro does interesting things with water and ice
[0:28:06] <kookaburragangwar> It is the gods hitting him for being alive
[0:28:07] <theanora1> his ultimate is a really good heal and damage boost
[0:28:09] <TheButtravage> The joke is Bennet is unlucky..
[0:28:10] <blerrger19> Bennett is unlucky
[0:28:13] <itsdasteve> so he's a dork
[0:28:22] <blerrger19> he has two dads tho so that's cool
[0:28:33] <%Heart0fInk> He's gonna develop an aneurism in the back of his head.
[0:28:38] <$hypergenn2> Bennet is that kid that apologizes too much and i hate it and love him
[0:28:46] <+kachucho> lmao the avatar's eye widened up
[0:28:50] <TheButtravage> Bennet is an exceptional unit gameplaywise though.
[0:28:55] <blerrger19> wait until you meet Zhong Li and he never shuts up about tea or explaining how boats work
[0:28:59] <$hypergenn2> that charge attack CAN kill you with gravity
[0:29:00] <Andele1503> Nah, its because Genshin is using a unity dot mechanics pack that doesnt interact with Buffs. Same as with their combat pack Bladeworks and why some in air hitboxes end up iffy
[0:29:02] <+kachucho> muh immersion is satisfied Kreygasm Kreygasm
[0:29:13] <lemoan> The voice sounds like english dub Killua
[0:29:31] <$hypergenn2> theres 3 levels of charge
[0:29:53] <blerrger19> whiff frames! yea
[0:30:12] <%Heart0fInk> Thats... fuckin stupid..
[0:30:14] <CaptainGreenbeans> Shut up- anime logic
[0:30:14] <+kachucho> muh unlucky gimmick
[0:30:25] <+kachucho> it's funny until it affects the gameplay
[0:30:26] <@Nightbot> Plague is a youtube animator and also streams at https://picarto.tv/Plague . Also: t-shirts! http://goo.gl/lze8QO
[0:30:35] <blerrger19> maid knight!
[0:30:39] <%ralphwiggum16> Genshin Impact is the Dark Souls of gacha games.
[0:30:39] <blerrger19> we stan Noelle
[0:30:44] <cap_bon> We need Lucky Ted as a character
[0:31:00] <Andele1503> Noel best meido, sadly her jp va is much better than en and cn one
[0:31:17] <blerrger19> She's still "training" to become a knight but because of anime logic she's eternally training
[0:31:22] <+kachucho> @andele1503 thats the usual way
[0:31:25] <%Heart0fInk> Wemen Can't Be Strong! Whadda Stoopid!?
[0:31:28] <xeros720> she's a cleaner, she feels nothing when she sees a dead body
[0:31:34] <blerrger19> @Heart0fInk Jean
[0:31:42] <Teyaric> actually she's a maid because she's the I WILL WORK THE HARDEEEEEST And the knights know she'd get herself killed.
[0:31:43] <%ralphwiggum16> Can I be the main character of Genshin Impact?
[0:32:00] <+kachucho> @ralphwiggum16 only if you are built like link
[0:32:24] <Julkson> Ghost kitty
[0:32:27] <+Axza95> Cheer100 Hey, stopping by to say hi, just wanted to quickly say you have a very relaxing voice, love your art gripes AND art. And your perspective on creativity I think has helped me a great deal. I wish you a fun stream!
[0:32:38] <blerrger19> I have so many gripes about the GUI, but I'll leave it to you to feel it out
[0:33:39] <Axza95> I just got off work, I'm just dirty and sore. I'll try and be back assuming I don't pass out
[0:33:40] <cap_bon> Well thats great I forgot to turn off audacity so I guess now I gotta cut plagues explanation of the characters out LUL
[0:33:55] <%SilverRoddo> SilverRoddo gifted a Tier 1 sub to Axza95! They have given 2 Gift Subs in the channel! 
[0:33:58] <+kachucho> winds howling kind of shit?
[0:34:02] <fruit_pie_the_magician> This game is this really strange combination of fun and total trash
[0:34:19] <%Axza95> Thank you for the gift sub!
[0:34:39] <%Axza95> Axza95 is paying forward the Gift they got from SilverRoddo to the community! 
[0:34:39] <%Axza95> Axza95 is gifting 1 Tier 1 Subs to PlagueOfGripes's community! They've gifted a total of 1 in the channel! 
[0:34:39] <%Axza95> Axza95 gifted a Tier 1 sub to TQuick101! 
[0:34:40] <cap_bon> damn he just digging his hands straight into bark
[0:34:45] <%Axza95> I'll just give back real quickly
[0:35:00] <blerrger19> its BotW but anime and a gacha that sells itself on characters, but you'll never get them LUL
[0:35:05] <Andele1503> Exploring isnt bad, playing what comes after the equivalent of finishing BotW however is giga shit
[0:35:17] <blerrger19> grind is giga shit agreed
[0:36:04] <fruit_pie_the_magician> I've played the giga shit enough that I have like 5 five star characters
[0:36:09] <blerrger19> I think its poorly optimized for PC but its impossible to play without a controller imo
[0:36:39] <+MrWrann> I play no problem with keyboard and mouse
[0:36:46] <Andele1503> The spyware "anti tamper"  (that doesnt protect it from instant cooldown and animation speed hacks) doesnt like most non-west taiwan game recording programs
[0:36:51] <BeardAndPipe> keyboard and mouse is fine, I played kbm to AR59
[0:37:38] <blerrger19> @MrWrann moreso I meant its impossible to play on the phone with touchscreen controls
[0:38:02] <+MrWrann> I would not try this on a phone ever
[0:38:06] <BeardAndPipe> Kreygasm Ningguang
[0:38:18] <Andele1503> Geo mommy
[0:38:18] <fruit_pie_the_magician> Have fun doing the fishing minigame for like two weeks to get the only good four star spear
[0:38:35] <blerrger19> Bennet one of the best supports, do you know about the trap?
[0:38:47] <xeros720> Noelle just has an HP shield
[0:38:58] <Andele1503> idk if she still is, but geo mommy/ning was actually a top level dps
[0:39:01] <+kachucho> @blerrger19 trap? i knew this game had dome weird shit NotLikeThis
[0:39:08] <blerrger19> @kachucho not that kind! xD
[0:39:10] <xeros720> yup
[0:39:13] <+Mossinoda> Basically
[0:39:17] <blerrger19> yup
[0:39:21] <fruit_pie_the_magician> Ninguang is good, but mostly after you farm the living balls off the specific set that makes her good and spend like a million shit
[0:39:24] <Andele1503> and it has a 50-60% rng chance to heal
[0:39:39] <blerrger19> Its buried in menus but there are skill descriptions for each of the characters
[0:39:43] <+kachucho> @andele1503 rng Kreygasm Kreygasm
[0:39:45] <blerrger19> iirc her shield is based off her hp stat
[0:39:48] <fruit_pie_the_magician> Pretty sure almost everything Noelle has scales off her defense
[0:39:54] <+Mossinoda> What do you think of the story so far? @PlagueOfGripes
[0:40:06] <blerrger19> No, wait, @fruit_pie_the_magician is right. She's all about defense
[0:40:10] <Andele1503> (despite all the feedback to make it 100% baseline and the dupe upgrade make the healing increase in % with Def %, which could have made her a real healer...
[0:40:19] <cap_bon> ooooh pretty cape wings]
[0:40:39] <blerrger19> @Andele1503 well there's the one...constellation? or something that makes it 100%...I think?
[0:41:16] <fruit_pie_the_magician> Luckily defense is considered a bottom tier stat so any artifacts you farm have a way higher chance of being good for her
[0:41:58] <Andele1503> @blerrger19 yes, and a lot of early (beta and pre first patch) feedback on her was make that constellation baseline via upgrade % and instead in that const slot have its heal scale up with Def, since that way she would synch entirely with attacks)
[0:42:02] <blerrger19> You're still really early game. Story will explain magic sooner or later. The interesting part for me is the abyss and stuff from there, but the story doesn't talk about that enough
[0:42:05] <+najaytheslug> Plague I want to cuddle your fluffy little ears so bad
[0:42:19] <%SilverRoddo> plagueTaps
[0:42:21] <Teyaric> Vision = Magic Gem that allows Elemental stuff. it comes from surviving a traumatic / intense moment through Anime Willpower, and puts you in the running to be a God.
[0:42:37] <blerrger19> @Andele1503 Yeah she's pretty bad at what she does basically because rng. I can see why people want 100% baseline or some kind of upgrade
[0:42:51] <blerrger19> Noelle discussion ye
[0:43:53] <%Axza95> If you think it's complicated here, you would lose your mind trying to figure out how elements in warframe work
[0:44:29] <Andele1503> @Axza95 He already figured it out ages ago, plague has a pretty decent WF account
[0:44:34] <+najaytheslug> Fire, Wind, Water, Heart, Geodude, Anime got it
[0:44:56] <fruit_pie_the_magician> Rock paper scissors with fire, ice and water. Wind spreads existing elements, electric is broadly effective
[0:44:59] <%Axza95> Oh, I didn't realize he played warframe... I am surprised I did not know this
[0:45:09] <+najaytheslug> Divinity 2 has something similar
[0:45:17] <blerrger19> Superconduct is underrated!
[0:45:29] <blerrger19> Yes!
[0:45:29] <Andele1503> @najaytheslug Divinity 1 and iirc Divine Divinity too
[0:45:44] <blerrger19> Overload is kind of annoying cuz of the explosion
[0:45:49] <fruit_pie_the_magician> I'm like AR 57 or some shit, and I don't know what vaporize, melt, or superconduct actually do. I just know that some of them are OP, namely vaporize
[0:45:50] <+Mossinoda> Swirl is my favorite just from how easy it is to achieve
[0:45:55] <UmoLoco> Is this game fun?
[0:46:13] <+Mossinoda> swirl lowkey broken
[0:46:18] <blerrger19> Fire shield is weird
[0:46:29] <fruit_pie_the_magician> What's fuckd up is water would work but ice doesn't
[0:46:50] <xeros720> pretty much it just consumes it
[0:47:00] <+Mossinoda> The water shields are the weirdest. I've been playing since launch and didn't realize until last month that ice is most effective against water shields, not lightning
[0:47:04] <+najaytheslug> LUL
[0:47:16] <SweepTheLegoMyEggo> your team can also get buffs depending on your element team comp
[0:47:19] <blerrger19> water shields are annoying too
[0:47:29] <xeros720> well there's two things that really screw it up
[0:47:33] <blerrger19> I don't have good water dps so fire shields present the biggest problem for me, but water is pretty bad too
[0:47:44] <fruit_pie_the_magician> Just have to remember the interactions for fire ice and water
[0:47:45] <+najaytheslug> like light and dark in any other game
[0:48:04] <fruit_pie_the_magician> Also no one even uses it
[0:48:06] <+Mossinoda> There are also no playable characters with nature Kappa
[0:48:22] <blerrger19> The most annoying elemental...thing in the game for me personally is most fire characters will burn themselves to death using their own abilities if they're standing in grass LUL
[0:48:25] <+TheAdMerlin> Grass plus fire killed a lot of the hardcore players during one patch since the Dendro/pyro interaction scaling changed for one patch
[0:48:28] <%Heart0fInk> I don't know how to feel about 'Rock. Paper. Scissors' mechanics in games. I kinda don't like it.
[0:49:11] <fruit_pie_the_magician> I got fucked for like 3 hours by one set of enemies because it was raining and they were ice and water
[0:49:13] <%Axza95> I'm new to genshin, I was bashing my greatsword against an ice thinking hoping it would shatter... it did not
[0:49:35] <blerrger19> There are seven elements, Geo doesn't interact with any of them, and Dendro doesn't exist. So just worry about the remaining 5...except don't LUL
[0:49:49] <xeros720> no, you're doing it right
[0:49:53] <blerrger19> Yep, you got it
[0:49:54] <%SilverRoddo> Bat-tah-ery!
[0:50:00] <xeros720> that's kind of how people think of characters, they perform a function in the team
[0:50:06] <blerrger19> 4 characters, 1 main dps, 3 supports
[0:50:08] <+IamLeowulf> meanwhile I have noelle built for dps
[0:50:20] <+Mossinoda> iirc there is a hidden interaction called shatter when you hit frozen enemies with a greatsword. It's working but the game won't tell you except for visually
[0:50:26] <pleochronic> the game gives alot of ways to ignore mechanics once you get utility artifacts like Viridescent Venerer or Retracing Bolide
[0:50:30] <blerrger19> pop a shield, pop a buff, go ham, have a healer on reserve
[0:50:34] <fruit_pie_the_magician> The way you do good damage is you get 3 of those mostly useless characters to leave their shit on the field and multiply the "good" character
[0:50:36] <+najaytheslug> oh bennett LUL
[0:50:37] <Andele1503> 1 character does damage by swinging, 1 heals, rest drop duration based things that boost dps or cause procs
[0:50:42] <blerrger19> @IamLeowulf a man of culture!
[0:50:59] <%Heart0fInk> Find you a woman that can break rocks real good.
[0:51:03] <blerrger19> @Mossinoda shatter guarantees a crit
[0:51:22] <+TheAdMerlin> Geo tends to have higher base stats due to no reactions
[0:51:27] <+najaytheslug> are elements based on character, weapon, skills, enchantments or what?
[0:51:48] <blerrger19> you were talking about some crystals? I think the geo reaction that gives contextual shields
[0:51:57] <%cooldude69xx> Sick apples tho
[0:51:58] <+Mossinoda> @blerrger19 oh shoot really? That explains why everyone sweats over eula gameplay wise
[0:51:59] <fruit_pie_the_magician> Basically geo is balls unless you have Zhongli, in which case he has a shield that is literally gamebreaking
[0:52:10] <JohnClaggart> the crystals change your shield to resist that colour element more
[0:52:27] <blerrger19> @Mossinoda Shatter? Yeah. Its only if you hit a frozen character with a greatsword, and only good for one hit iirc
[0:52:45] <fruit_pie_the_magician> Swirl is just multiplying existing elements
[0:52:46] <+Mossinoda> that's crazy
[0:53:00] <+IamLeowulf> noelle can lift a whole book case with one hand
[0:53:00] <+Mossinoda> too bad i don't use cryo LUL
[0:53:03] <pleochronic> the game is a bit weird cause most of the starters are optimally built as main dps so its just very clunky till you get xiangling or pull
[0:53:07] <+IamLeowulf> just thought this was important info
[0:53:10] <blerrger19> gotta work hydro into your comp, but yeah Eula is stupid phys/cryo dps
[0:53:20] <Andele1503> Wasnt Shatter any hit over a damage threshold but treshold is much lower for GS?
[0:53:27] <pleochronic> even noelle is best as main dps to get enemy particles on death to maintain heals
[0:53:32] <blerrger19> you've got it!
[0:53:40] <JohnClaggart> there's no threshold on magic
[0:53:44] <blerrger19> That's how you clear endgame content and the spiral abyss
[0:53:51] <+IamLeowulf> if you make your number big enough you can do whatever in most of the game's content
[0:54:14] <fruit_pie_the_magician> That's working really nice because barbara is making them all wet, and then using bennet to light them on fire and spreading it with wind is doing big vaporize
[0:54:24] <xeros720> that's "energy"
[0:54:53] <blerrger19> @Andele1503 if there's some kind of threshold like that then idk about it, all I know is shatter happens whenever a GS hits a frozen enemy
[0:54:59] <+IamLeowulf> I made the bindings the same as dmc
[0:55:32] <+BinaryFireball> ahh the demon waifu game
[0:55:53] <SweepTheLegoMyEggo> b to confirm and a to cancel was horrible
[0:55:53] <xeros720> yeah, some are just really good at generating energy
[0:56:11] <blerrger19> iirc swirl is the way to play the game, the damage of elemental reactions scales off elemental mastery and ignores level difference and def...?
[0:56:17] <+BinaryFireball> wait you have a party in genshin??? I never knew that
[0:56:26] <xeros720> technically, every "ball" gives the whole party energy, but the matching element gives more
[0:56:28] <UmoLoco> You're sighing so much. Is that because there's a lot to explain or because its frustrating?
[0:56:34] <Raldavar> Shatter is any heavy hit like geo, greatswords, certain plunging attacks and skills hitting frozen targets. The damage is always physical and based on level and elemental mastery
[0:56:43] <%eldercat> !uptime
[0:56:43] <@Nightbot> 56 minutes 53 seconds
[0:56:51] <Andele1503> @BinaryFireball You dont, you play as 1 person and 3 farming tools that sometimes appear for 1-3 seconds
[0:57:01] <+BinaryFireball> oooooh
[0:57:12] <+IamLeowulf> right away I felt the party membering swaping felt like dante's style  switching
[0:58:06] <Andele1503> Oh god i hope, the amount of extra depth where if character switching took on the place in attack chain the last characters action took would at least give some extra 20h of fun memes
[0:58:21] <+Mossinoda> He goes pretty hard if you train him up, but that goes for every character
[0:58:39] <+IamLeowulf> @Mossinoda make number beeg
[0:58:52] <+penguinlords> once you get to the third chapter the main character becomes one of the best general batteries in the game
[0:58:56] <Andele1503> Her spin is sadly terrible dps
[0:59:04] <blerrger19> @Raldavar so I looked it up and you're right ANY heavy hit will cause shatter, at least from GS, Geo, plunging attacks, or Explosion anyway
[0:59:11] <blerrger19> And it scales off EM and ignores Def
[0:59:15] <blerrger19> time to build EM on my Eula!
[0:59:20] <+Mossinoda> @Mossinoda As a xinyan main, "big number unga bunga" were my first words as a baby
[0:59:34] <pleochronic> with the exception of noelle (cause she can't generate energy) pretty much every character is able to do anything late game, its quite fun to make stupid builds
[0:59:38] <Raldavar> Geo MC getw a lot of use in geo teams for quick-swap damage
[0:59:40] <xeros720> vaporize is just a damage multiplier
[1:00:01] <blerrger19> @Mossinoda Ayo Xinyan spin2win bby
[1:00:20] <hollowedsilence> I think it’s shields that keep you from getting knocked back. With a shield on you, the lvl 3 charge’s knockback is negated.
[1:00:41] <fruit_pie_the_magician> Once his shield is down he can be fucked like anyone else
[1:00:45] <+penguinlords> ^
[1:00:53] <pleochronic> knockback is also a hidden character stat tied to specific animations
[1:01:02] <%Heart0fInk> wow. they're really don't shut the fuck up huh?
[1:01:29] <xeros720> really wish they'd let us change how often they sound off
[1:01:33] <blerrger19> You say you hate them now, but wait till you meet Beidou LUL
[1:01:36] <hollowedsilence> No, no they don’t.
[1:01:45] <UmoLoco> You're sighing so much. Is that because there's a lot to explain or because its frustrating?
[1:01:54] <Raldavar> Rock lady is silent most of the time
[1:01:57] <Twoiis> Chest voice lines are relatively new.
[1:02:02] <%SilverRoddo> Has anyone ever used the “tin-can filled water on the heater” trick to battle air-dryness?
[1:02:10] <blerrger19> She's an idol AND a priestess
[1:02:24] <+Mossinoda> Plague is gonna love beidou, probably
[1:02:27] <%theloganbrand> Just like my ex wife
[1:02:28] <%SilverRoddo> KPOPheart
[1:02:43] <Mogel56> I wonder when I'll be as tall as my big sister
[1:02:52] <fruit_pie_the_magician> I still don't have beidou and i've pulled like 5  five stars
[1:02:54] <TheGoodTimeGirl> these characters are very unappealing
[1:02:58] <%theloganbrand> Kaeya is the one I see in all the porn
[1:03:19] <relaxedray> @theloganbrand 💀
[1:03:19] <Andele1503> Amber is the "turns on torches" tier
[1:03:23] <fruit_pie_the_magician> There are like 3 characters that are just better Lisa
[1:03:49] <+Mossinoda> "botw flaming arrow puzzle" tier
[1:03:50] <Raldavar> Lisa used to be an omni-resistence shred till they nerfed her
[1:04:16] <pleochronic> Electro is a bit underrated cause it can benefit from the 3 strongest utility artifact sets without opportunity cost whilst also shredding barriers in the background, like a weird bastard of geo and anemo
[1:04:24] <Raldavar> Can't sell buffed Zhongli if Lisa can do the same
[1:04:27] <CyberDingus> PixelBob Wait, what? Plagues plays Genshin? Didn't expect that.
[1:04:27] <fruit_pie_the_magician> Watame syndrome
[1:05:16] <CyberDingus> PixelBob Ah, you have Ningguang. Mistress of perfect legs. Good catch.
[1:05:43] <xeros720> too wide eyed and bushy tailed
[1:06:28] <CyberDingus> PixelBob You mean Level Licenses ?
[1:06:33] <Andele1503> Ah yes, 1 to 10 xp on a 4mil xp bar
[1:06:51] <%cosmicleviathan18> that kinda sucks
[1:07:06] <MountainBandits> those are pamphlets, youll farm for books later
[1:07:18] <Raldavar> That's wrong you just have to kill 3 billion enemies to level up once
[1:07:44] <+Mossinoda> Arknights does this crap too and I have never seen a gacha that does this level system well. Levelling up by fighting just doesn't want to be a thing anymore in these games that want to be rpgs
[1:07:49] <Raldavar> Spend 3 lifetimes it's not a big deal
[1:07:52] <%cosmicleviathan18> saw that one coming bo8Bsmug
[1:07:55] <+PharosOfLight> the souvineer shop it mentions is a store in town, it's not a real money thing
[1:08:00] <fruit_pie_the_magician> You need like 90-100 purple books to level a character from 70-80
[1:08:00] <MountainBandits> you can get those colored rocks from commission reawrds too
[1:08:07] <+cactusplasma> max level is 90
[1:08:10] <Twoiis> Character level max is 90
[1:08:11] <xeros720> nah, each one after that is an increase of 10
[1:08:13] <Mogel56> 90
[1:08:14] <relaxedray> it goes by 10 at some point
[1:08:18] <xeros720> 20, to 40, then 50
[1:08:33] <pleochronic> weapons, too, are 90
[1:08:43] <CyberDingus> PixelBob Sorry to back-seat, but that yellow dust can be bought in one in-game shop for in-game coins you find in chests, if I recall correctly.
[1:09:27] <fruit_pie_the_magician> Yeah, to get a single character to C6 you would probably have to pull like 1000 times
[1:09:31] <mustachegolem> oh yea this is evil
[1:09:40] <Andele1503> And often over 50% of the characters power is locked behind that
[1:09:47] <MountainBandits> its super messed up
[1:09:48] <%Gogogolem> Gogogolem subscribed with Prime. They've subscribed for 14 months! So fun fact about benny, his final unlocked ability makes him worse.
[1:10:03] <@Nightbot> Plague is a youtube animator and also streams at https://picarto.tv/Plague . Also: t-shirts! http://goo.gl/lze8QO
[1:10:06] <+Mossinoda> yep, each time you get a character you are getting a scuffed incomplete version of that character
[1:10:07] <CyberDingus> PixelBob And not only that, but you can on accident get C6 characters that sit on bench, and get no wanted characters.
[1:10:09] <+dante_must_die_exe> my flatmate kept trying to get me to install genshin even after they explained this exact mechanic
[1:10:18] <mandatoryviolence> The only good thing is that most characters can be viable with few to no constellations.
[1:10:36] <pleochronic> more than a bit troubling, especially with characters with lisa and amber where its clear parts of their kit were cut out and locked behind it and are obscenely rare otherwise
[1:10:45] <Raldavar> Bennett without C1 is kind of meh honestly
[1:10:50] <+Mossinoda> heh...
[1:11:11] <+Mossinoda> mora...
[1:11:12] <Mogel56> freemium premium and premium plus currencies
[1:11:38] <%cosmicleviathan18> plagueWut plagueWut plagueWut
[1:12:02] <fruit_pie_the_magician> Starglitter too
[1:12:16] <%cosmicleviathan18> I have the feeling they made this complicated on purpose
[1:12:17] <+Baslam> make sure to get the 5 free acquaint fate in the shop
[1:12:31] <mandatoryviolence> And constellations fortunately do not affect stats, give extra effects to skills.
[1:12:44] <Andele1503> "For some reason" = conversion rate, so that you always have to buy the 1 pack up, like warframe regal aya was
[1:12:45] <mustachegolem> after you finish exploring the maps it gets worse btw
[1:13:02] <CyberDingus> PixelBob It is very terrible, true. Teaches you to value your ''money'' in a sense. This gave is your stingy grandma that gives you stuff for free, but just a bit.
[1:13:23] <xeros720> pretty much people with more money than patience
[1:13:27] <mustachegolem> my grandma was not that evil
[1:13:34] <xeros720> genesis crystals are just paid primos
[1:13:38] <+PharosOfLight> Genesis crystals are the thing you can only get from cash
[1:13:39] <Twoiis> The plat of Warframe.
[1:13:45] <%Heart0fInk> They unlock Genesis Valentine.
[1:13:45] <MountainBandits> buy costums and useless packs
[1:13:47] <CyberDingus> PixelBob Gen Crystalls = Primos, but holy crap the exchange rate is ugly.
[1:13:59] <fruit_pie_the_magician> They are purchasable with money and they are NOTHING but primogem money
[1:14:08] <blerrger19> tl;dr too many currencies, obfuscation of value is rampant, not enough free pulls
[1:14:12] <xeros720> you can also use them for yeah, outfits, and other packages with upgrade materials
[1:14:21] <Mogel56> path points are a very recent addition.
[1:14:25] <+PharosOfLight> i wouldnt call epitomied path a currency
[1:14:26] <CyberDingus> PixelBob Welcome to the stock market mateys!
[1:14:29] <fruit_pie_the_magician> Basically double pity
[1:14:34] <relaxedray> lol
[1:14:48] <Andele1503> TLDR: 8 common, 12 used, 13 total currencies all to hide grind/progression blockers and how much money is sunk
[1:14:58] <+Mossinoda> i really like this game and i agree with everything said thus far, the monetization is unforgivable
[1:15:23] <TheButtravage> Not very accurate.
[1:15:26] <CyberDingus> PixelBob This is Dark Souls of Gacha Games
[1:15:37] <GhostlyTumor> Is this game okay? I got bored like 1 hour in
[1:15:45] <blerrger19> Wait until you start seeing 5-star weapons that give unique buffs that do not stack or interact with each other
[1:15:55] <fruit_pie_the_magician> It's so much better when everyone speaks a language I don't understand
[1:15:57] <CyberDingus> PixelBob Good man. But stop bullying Benny.
[1:16:29] <mustachegolem> Does any character in this have anything of value to say?
[1:16:29] <TheButtravage> @PlagueOfGripes It's almost like the characters have one or two primary traits.
[1:16:31] <%cosmicleviathan18> Benny sucks it up
[1:16:37] <%cosmicleviathan18> suck
[1:16:38] <+Mossinoda> He does, but that'll come in his hangout
[1:16:54] <%Heart0fInk> Was never interested in this game but these constant voice lines solidify that i will NEVER play this shit.
[1:16:57] <+Mossinoda> well he kinda does
[1:17:03] <CyberDingus> PixelBob Ask Lisa for help. She loves rain!
[1:17:10] <Andele1503> thats because barbara becomes wet when she sings
[1:17:11] <MountainBandits> God plague will hate the mountain
[1:17:13] <mustachegolem> barbara wets herself with her buffs
[1:17:13] <xeros720> Barbara's skill makes you wet a few times during its duration
[1:17:13] <+PharosOfLight> Barbara's one ability makes her constantly wet and vulnerable to frozen. Also it's raining so you're always wet anyways
[1:17:21] <Andele1503> she is nyanners but less seiso
[1:17:23] <Mogel56> Yea it sucks that barbara's skill wets herself
[1:17:23] <pleochronic> in theory income gets worse by the time you finish the map, but practically it kinda hovers where it used to be because you can complete harder event challenges and spiral abyss, but its still egregious to put it lightly
[1:17:40] <fruit_pie_the_magician> lol I literally stopped using barbara because her skill makes you wet and ice enemies with just pwn the shit out of you, it's super irritating
[1:18:02] <Andele1503> @pleochronic Yes, you have to spend time and progression to stay where you are
[1:18:05] <%cosmicleviathan18> can you Sprint or do you always have to casually jog at them?
[1:18:08] <+PharosOfLight> it wont burn while it's raining
[1:18:11] <+Mossinoda> burning wont work here cuz it's raining
[1:18:16] <Andele1503> also known as chingchong gacha logic
[1:18:16] <+Baslam> rain gives constant wet status
[1:18:18] <blerrger19> @PharosOfLight Kappa
[1:18:42] <Mogel56> Shields can be frozen and then melted to clear faster. Sometimes explosions also get rid of it.
[1:19:05] <MountainBandits> noelle is a beast at c6 but thats basically saving 2 years worth of primos to dump on a banner
[1:19:17] <CyberDingus> PixelBob Temptation to make suggestions in the elemental department is high.
[1:19:27] <blerrger19> ex) "Revolutionary Chorale: A part of the 'Millennial Movement' that wanders amidst the winds. Increases DMG by 10%. When the character wielding this weapon triggers Elemental Reactions, they gain a Sigil of Rebellion. This effect can be triggered once every 0.5s and can be triggered even if said character is not on the field. When you possess 2 Sigils of Rebellion, all of them will be consumed and all nearby party members will obtain 'Millennial Movement: song of Resistance' for 12s.
[1:19:33] <blerrger19> and that's not even half the buff description
[1:19:41] <TheButtravage> @MountainBandits That's an overexaggeration, Noelle shows up commonly on banners, it doesn't take long to C6 her unless you are really unlucky.
[1:19:47] <Andele1503> @MountainBandits "beast" that due to bad reco, frame time and without batter is about as effective as diluc spamming aa
[1:19:53] <%cosmicleviathan18> good lord someone is writing a novel in chat
[1:19:54] <fruit_pie_the_magician> Wind is just good in general
[1:19:55] <xeros720> the wind skills have a lot of base strength, but scale poorer by end game
[1:20:03] <Andele1503> (still love big numbers and noel is waifu)
[1:20:05] <%Heart0fInk> Welp. this annoying gambling game looks fun n all. but i'm sleepy as fuck. Gnight everybody! plagueTaps
[1:20:08] <xeros720> it's still really good though, so i'm not sure why they are lying to you
[1:20:18] <blerrger19> @cosmicleviathan18 just an example of some of the more confusing weapon buffs in the game LUL
[1:20:26] <%cosmicleviathan18> @heart0fink good night plagueWave plagueWave plagueWave
[1:20:28] <+PharosOfLight> wind's great, but they're comparing the main character to, like, venti who black-holes all the enmies together and blenders them
[1:20:29] <%SoFarFetched> How's Genshin been treating you?
[1:20:31] <pleochronic> swirl is busted, and does better when triggered from offscreen
[1:20:33] <Mogel56> wind is just "bad" compared to later game for other elements.
[1:20:53] <TheButtravage> @xeros720 All the damage in Anemo comes from the swirl reaction which scales with Elemental mastery.
[1:21:02] <CyberDingus> PixelBob Elements are very important. Having someone with a attention-grabbing skill is also useful.
[1:21:13] <Andele1503> It becomes the worst parts of warframe without the fun mass murder
[1:21:13] <TheButtravage> @PlagueOfGripes It becomes daily chores when you run out of content.
[1:21:15] <mustachegolem> you just go into holes to kill things
[1:21:25] <xeros720> yeah, eventually you explore everything
[1:21:27] <+karovus> karovus subscribed with Prime. 
[1:21:32] <+JavaManJoJo> yeah you just run out of landmass to explore until they add more
[1:21:37] <fruit_pie_the_magician> Farming for artifacts and ascension mats becomes the game
[1:21:57] <pleochronic> if you get off screen electro application wind gets p stupid
[1:22:10] <blerrger19> you can turn off join requests in settings somewhere
[1:22:10] <+Mossinoda> Once you get sucrose, wind will be a much better tool since her skills suck in enemies
[1:22:30] <xeros720> yeah, wind, if nothing else, is amazing because it enables that
[1:22:34] <Andele1503> Only in end game the game actively tries to prevent you from doing that
[1:23:07] <+Mossinoda> I think it's from chests and items. I've only ever 100% one or two areas
[1:23:07] <Mogel56> find all chests, seelies and the floaty things.
[1:23:09] <MountainBandits> yeah
[1:23:12] <Dreigun> you can eventually get a tool that helps track down random chests you missed
[1:23:14] <Andele1503> yes, but there are little things that give you detectors in the region cities
[1:23:18] <TheButtravage> @PlagueOfGripes The 100% meter is very generous, you literally don't have to get everything in an area for 100%.
[1:23:34] <blerrger19> yeah
[1:23:36] <fruit_pie_the_magician> No, because you'll never find everything doing that. You'd need a wiki and there's no way to know what you already have
[1:24:05] <Mogel56> There's other unlockable items from your rep that can help locate items. But its way easier to use the interactive map they provide.
[1:24:27] <TheButtravage> @PlagueOfGripes There are also times when new areas are out that the meter isn't all that accurate so you might be at 95% and just can't find anything, then after a patch you'll be at 100%.
[1:24:53] <%SilverRoddo> Mantaur
[1:25:51] <%mustachegolem> mustachegolem subscribed with Prime. 
[1:26:21] <TheButtravage> Yeah, I'm not sure how Dragonspine scaling works since I played it when it was new, I assume you are meant to do it later but you came in when an event was hosted there. @PlagueOfGripes
[1:26:25] <pleochronic> if only you could turn the enemies into living torches
[1:26:30] <%SilverRoddo> CurseLit CurseLit
[1:26:34] <Mogel56> That was the most annoying thing for me when they released the area.
[1:27:03] <MountainBandits> theres a part in that area where you need to fight a bunch of ice enemies in the middle of a lake for achallenge in order to advance the quest there
[1:27:31] <+Mossinoda> There are stealth sections, but the npc area of sight is broken at times. You can tell mihoyo is new to making sneak scenes
[1:28:36] <+PharosOfLight> there's these new stealth dailies that are terrible. I just fail them and kill everyone each time
[1:28:53] <TheButtravage> God I forgot Barbara's voicelines were changed in English and now she sounds dead inside instead of upbeat.
[1:29:14] <Mogel56> No but barbara sounding dead inside is way more idol-like.
[1:29:22] <%SilverRoddo> I’d go with: Let the shore begin.
[1:29:30] <+Mossinoda> I miss barbara's old voice...
[1:29:30] <Mogel56> Kappa
[1:29:38] <blerrger19> 15 more finds like that and you get ONE pull
[1:29:48] <ShellShockDelinquent> @TheButtravage yeah, i miss barbras raspy voice :(
[1:29:51] <%cosmicleviathan18> I really don't think he's unlucky bo8Bsmug
[1:29:54] <+Ancopro> nu uh amber Kappa
[1:29:54] <+PharosOfLight> my main character uses a purple bow...
[1:29:55] <blerrger19> in a game where only every 10th pull matters
[1:29:57] <relaxedray> bro i wish those quest where spameable
[1:30:13] <@Nightbot> Plague is a youtube animator and also streams at https://picarto.tv/Plague . Also: t-shirts! http://goo.gl/lze8QO
[1:30:21] <+PharosOfLight> oh you got asecond one, you can refine it
[1:30:23] <TheButtravage> lol Plauge.
[1:30:24] <Andele1503> Gives atk buff to characters you switch to from her
[1:30:24] <Mogel56> There's a 3 star claymore that PUMPs phys that you might find useful.
[1:30:29] <xeros720> she heals better and the buff is pretty handy
[1:30:29] <Mogel56> The switching effect
[1:30:35] <blerrger19> all her healing is based on hp, and she switches
[1:30:39] <Dreigun> it also raises her HP, which increases her healing
[1:30:39] <+Ancopro> yea
[1:30:42] <%Gogogolem> exactly
[1:30:43] <TheButtravage> Correct.
[1:30:46] <MountainBandits> its a support weapon to switch to a main dps yeah
[1:30:49] <Andele1503> yup, barbara is best by removing her after she wets herself
[1:30:56] <TheButtravage> It's not to boost Barbara's damage it's to boost your DPS damage.
[1:30:56] <fruit_pie_the_magician> Because the buffs it gives you stay on even though you only have her on fild for a second
[1:30:59] <+Mossinoda> my main uses a purple claymore cuz i never got a five star one coneyPOGNT
[1:31:13] <Andele1503> Its not just a solved system, it was solved from start with noobtraps
[1:31:23] <biglomix> thats why you be a bumblefuck and don't look anything up
[1:31:27] <Andele1503> *intentional noobtraps
[1:31:31] <TheButtravage> @PlagueOfGripes There are other ways to build characters just that some builds are more optimal for the character role.
[1:31:34] <xeros720> the way characters are skilled, it tend to go one way or another
[1:31:45] <xeros720> a few characters really can be varied though
[1:31:45] <%Gogogolem> why though?
[1:31:50] <%House_0f_Rage> Barbaric
[1:31:52] <MountainBandits> i play on mouse and keyboard
[1:31:52] <biglomix> Japan
[1:32:03] <MountainBandits> c*china
[1:32:06] <blerrger19> ^ except this is made by China?
[1:32:10] <+Mossinoda> I know the map enough to not have to zoom out a lot so it doesn't bother me
[1:32:13] <%cosmicleviathan18> I don't like that
[1:32:25] <+lordericter> yep Mihoyo
[1:32:27] <%mustachegolem> I wonder if they made the mousewheel work in reverse as well
[1:32:32] <biglomix> There's no stature of glorius leader.
[1:32:38] <%SilverRoddo> plagueHarkness
[1:32:44] <%SoFarFetched> yeah that was a weird line delivery for something with an exclamation point
[1:32:47] <+PharosOfLight> her diologue being soft just stated happening in the latest patch
[1:32:53] <CyberDingus> PixelBob Plague, you can buy that yellow stones in the diamond-shaped shop. Saves some time.
[1:33:00] <+lordericter> LMAO
[1:33:05] <+Mossinoda> quality audio balancing :)
[1:33:10] <TheButtravage> Just change the language, holy fuck.
[1:33:25] <xeros720> no, we need to know what they did
[1:33:29] <MountainBandits> nope
[1:33:30] <%cosmicleviathan18> what the heck plagueWut
[1:33:31] <CyberDingus> PixelBob No.
[1:33:32] <%Gogogolem> Nope
[1:33:37] <MountainBandits> no it isnt
[1:33:37] <+MrWrann> Not the gold one
[1:33:38] <+PharosOfLight> the gold ones give gold
[1:33:40] <+MisdirectionErection> Nope
[1:33:43] <+Mossinoda> not really, that's for money
[1:33:46] <Mogel56> Yellow is only money not worth
[1:33:48] <%Gogogolem> @PlagueOfGripes  do the blue ones
[1:33:49] <Andele1503> Early on its kinda ok, but the cube boss rewards are better
[1:33:50] <+PharosOfLight> you want the teal ones that give exp
[1:33:50] <+Ancopro> when you got no money left
[1:33:52] <+Baslam> not for early game
[1:33:52] <Twoiis> I mean.. depends if you are using your resin for anything.
[1:33:52] <MountainBandits> to waste your resin on
[1:33:54] <fruit_pie_the_magician> Depends on who you're levelling
[1:34:04] <+Mossinoda> blue ones are for exp
[1:34:06] <CyberDingus> PixelBob Gold gives you money, you get it for playing the game. And the BLUE balls give you exp books, but you also get them by playing the game.
[1:34:07] <Mogel56> Blue is the character exp books
[1:34:11] <+PharosOfLight> if you click on them they'll tell you what they give
[1:34:15] <Andele1503> Boss
[1:34:15] <%Gogogolem> boss
[1:34:16] <TheButtravage> @PlagueOfGripes Gold one gives mora, blue ones give exp books.  You should try to spend your daily resin though since it will speed up your AR progress and get you resrouces.
[1:34:18] <Kyosan90> That's a boss
[1:34:20] <MountainBandits> do anything that looms like a boss
[1:34:21] <TheButtravage> That's an overworld boss.
[1:34:22] <+MisdirectionErection> Ice boss
[1:34:23] <%Gogogolem> give level up matetials
[1:34:23] <+MrWrann> Level up materials
[1:34:24] <CyberDingus> PixelBob Ice monster.
[1:34:25] <Andele1503> the non-cloud ones are bosses
[1:34:26] <xeros720> click on it
[1:34:28] <Mogel56> Thats a boss for ice character ascension
[1:34:35] <+Ancopro> money and water very important
[1:34:39] <fruit_pie_the_magician> One gives you gold and the other gives you EXP books, the others are "bosses"
[1:34:45] <+PharosOfLight> if you select it, it'll list rewards
[1:34:56] <+Mossinoda> you can check the rewards for it by selecting it
[1:35:26] <+Kekama> character ascension for breaking level caps
[1:35:29] <Mogel56> Specifically the ascension materials for the starting ice characters.
[1:35:31] <Twoiis> Bosses tend to give the ascension materials.
[1:35:33] <TheButtravage> Bosses primarily give character acension rewards.
[1:35:37] <+Ancopro> bosses is mostly for leveling characters. certain characters need em
[1:35:44] <TheButtravage> Oh, you don't read, so that's why you are confused.
[1:36:00] <%Gogogolem> it unlocks backstory
[1:36:02] <+MrWrann> Character lore
[1:36:03] <MountainBandits> frendship is only for lore
[1:36:20] <TheButtravage> @PlagueOfGripes Companionship is just flavor text.  Increasing it just gives you more character lore.
[1:36:34] <%cosmicleviathan18> is it friend zone meter?
[1:36:39] <%SilverRoddo> Social rank plagueHeh
[1:37:09] <MountainBandits> the deep and intresting lore of 2 dimensional gacha character
[1:37:22] <pleochronic> unrelated; if you ever want to fuck around the start of the straight sword charged attacks knockback has enough momentum to hurt enemies so you can just crush them against walls if your patient enough
[1:37:24] <+roderick_legend> Yo Plague, hope you doing great
[1:37:36] <$teddygrahams82> I want to get in to genshin but idk
[1:37:41] <xeros720> yes
[1:37:42] <+PharosOfLight> yes
[1:37:43] <+Kekama> yes
[1:37:45] <+MrWrann> You can
[1:37:46] <TheButtravage> You can.
[1:37:49] <Andele1503> @MountainBandits Yes, about how hard Lumine will snap Ganyus horns with her large geo dick or if the oni man will lose (his virginity) to the tengu girl
[1:37:53] <TheButtravage> Anything that spends resin you can do in co op.
[1:37:58] <+Mossinoda> you can do almost anything in co-op save for the abyss and a specific boss
[1:38:06] <+Mossinoda> and certain quests
[1:38:06] <Mogel56> If someone joined your game you can co-op
[1:38:16] <fruit_pie_the_magician> Yes, but you still have to spend resin
[1:38:18] <Andele1503> Nothing unless you spend your resin
[1:38:19] <xeros720> you get to spend resin to get the rewards too
[1:38:20] <+MrWrann> Same stuff if you use resin
[1:38:21] <+PharosOfLight> the "treasure chest" spawns for you privetly and you need to spend your own resin
[1:38:22] <TheButtravage> If you choose to spend resin you get those rewards.
[1:38:24] <+Kekama> you spend resin at the end of the fight even in co op
[1:38:26] <$teddygrahams82> lzysusWiggly
[1:38:31] <TheButtravage> Yes.
[1:38:32] <Mogel56> You spend your resin too for a roll
[1:38:32] <pleochronic> only benefit is achievement primogems and faster kills
[1:38:34] <xeros720> everyone has to spend resin
[1:38:37] <+Mossinoda> To get it done faster i guess
[1:38:41] <pleochronic> in fact you lose out on character affinity
[1:38:42] <+Kekama> just to make it easy
[1:38:44] <Mogel56> Co-op makes it "easier"
[1:38:49] <Andele1503> Resin is the daily "you cant play anymore" cap
[1:38:49] <Kyosan90> yes
[1:38:51] <+roderick_legend> it make kill the boss easier
[1:38:54] <MountainBandits> its for people who are bad at the game
[1:39:00] <+Ancopro> yea same for bosses too
[1:39:20] <+Mossinoda> They've got have.....moneeeeeey
[1:39:20] <TheButtravage> This might be a you thing, I didn't have that much trouble with this.
[1:39:27] <Andele1503> No, money, because you can buy resin
[1:39:46] <Mogel56> Those fire flowers were crafting material
[1:40:22] <TheButtravage> The overworld bosses aren't as complex as the event boss.
[1:40:23] <+roderick_legend> hit him in the eye when is down for extra damage
[1:40:25] <$teddygrahams82> usausaTanties usausaWiggle lzysusThisisfine murmYay murmPeek murmWoop vicksyBounce vicksyBounce vicksyDance vicksyTap vicksyHappy
[1:40:26] <+MisdirectionErection> Hit the head!
[1:40:33] <+PharosOfLight> it has weak points
[1:40:44] <CyberDingus> PixelBob Plague is horribly under-skilled and under-leveled
[1:40:54] <TheButtravage> Oh boy he is.
[1:41:06] <Andele1503> Vecayse sge wets gersekf
[1:41:19] <Andele1503> *Because she wets herself
[1:41:21] <%cosmicleviathan18> ice op?
[1:41:26] <+Baslam> it is always better to just spam it
[1:41:26] <TheButtravage> Yes, Bennets tap is more efficient.
[1:41:26] <+PharosOfLight> i usually just tap it
[1:41:28] <+Kekama> sad that her auto heal wets everything
[1:41:30] <MountainBandits> its better to spam
[1:41:40] <+Kekama> it just feels bad
[1:41:42] <Mogel56> You get the same amount of energy for charge and tap.
[1:41:51] <TheButtravage> What do you mean no reason lol?
[1:41:54] <xeros720> yeah, the cryo status sticks to you, so if you get wet again you freeze again
[1:41:56] <%cosmicleviathan18> she gets wet?! plagueHarkness bo8Gasm
[1:41:58] <TheButtravage> There is a reason for it.
[1:42:00] <MountainBandits> bennets whole existence is to do his ult
[1:42:04] <$teddygrahams82> how many hours do you have
[1:42:10] <+Baslam> barbara's elemental attack applies wet to herself, which makes her extremely easy to freeze
[1:42:11] <+roderick_legend> Barbara water skill applys Hydro to her, so when you get hit by cryo you get frozen
[1:42:13] <+Mossinoda> certain characters work off what i heard are ffxiv logic where you just spam because dps
[1:42:24] <Andele1503> You could have just stuck up close and kept hitting with noel
[1:42:30] <+NKOrange> Her rt makes her wet so ice freezes her
[1:42:35] <TheButtravage> Barbara's skill casts wet on the active character whenever it ticks a heal.
[1:42:56] <TheButtravage> @PlagueOfGripes Please, there is actually a mechanical reason for why you freeze.
[1:43:02] <pleochronic> generally its only for reaching high weak points
[1:43:09] <pleochronic> otherwise full charge is just bad
[1:43:12] <Mogel56> more hits of fire for moments like this fight when you're trying to break it's weak points.
[1:43:26] <$teddygrahams82> beans
[1:43:30] <+Baslam> the boss is applying cryo to your character, since she is getting the wet status from her skill, it freezes her
[1:43:40] <TheButtravage> @PlagueOfGripes Is it unfair because you don't understand it?
[1:43:41] <xeros720> the fact you freeze more than once really does suck
[1:43:53] <Pyrrhus90> the crime of existing
[1:44:07] <Andele1503> @TheButtravage Let him gripe, if the game doesnt teach it through gameplay but only UI based on player mechanics you might not remember or use if you didnt play kaya when the game thinks you want to play kaya (or read the journal 3 menus deep in), he may griple
[1:44:08] <Coystick> The crime of playing an anime
[1:44:12] <Andele1503> gripe*
[1:44:14] <pleochronic> the jump button being the way to clear it was definitely an intentional and cruel move
[1:44:21] <Mogel56> Barbara is wetting herself and the floor occasionally applies cryo.
[1:44:28] <xeros720> yeah, that's his damage bark
[1:45:09] <$teddygrahams82> frozen pee
[1:45:18] <TheButtravage> @TheButtravage I know that's his thing but you understand he can be unreasonable about it too?
[1:45:24] <+roderick_legend> hit him in the head plague
[1:45:30] <+Mossinoda> welp, im gonna get a bite to eat
[1:45:39] <+NKOrange> Bonk head for weak point
[1:45:42] <xeros720> nah, you're doing it, it just involves equipping and leveling up artifacts
[1:45:50] <+Baslam> the dodge has invincibility frames
[1:45:52] <biglomix> What that palm tree ever do to you
[1:45:53] <Mogel56> Have you levelled up the characters skills at all? Or levelled artifacts?

[1:46:25] <HeroToxiko> YEAH GO BENNET
[1:46:27] <EynoStiles> How is genshin? and what are you playing on?
[1:46:29] <DusK_The_Stray> Hi Plague

[1:46:45] <CrowbarFacelift> yeah hit that ice weed
[1:46:46] <blerrger19> as someone who's become dependent on Zhongli's shield, playing without a shield is suffering
[1:46:48] <+RealThiele> Bennett is the strongest character in the game
[1:46:50] <scallycap> get his ass
[1:46:59] <HeroToxiko> It's a worse version of bards ult
[1:47:00] <blerrger19> also you're not doing yourself any favors being constantly wet in a fight against a cryo boss
[1:47:15] <blerrger19> Barbara's ult will heal without making you wet
[1:47:15] <%SilverRoddo> I guess she’s water, she freezes plagueWut
[1:47:20] <Andele1503> @TheButtravage most things in genshin are tutorialized worse than warframes core mechanics. Plague can be unreasonable when "read something>proceeds to not read it", but when it comes to core gameloop this is spot on newbie experience based on 2 of my friends that aint minmaxers
[1:47:21] <TheButtravage> @blerrger19 Yeah, it is a mystery to him.
[1:47:24] <%cosmicleviathan18> off we go killing again ryboogFace

[1:48:03] <xeros720> yup
[1:48:10] <MountainBandits> yep
[1:48:14] <+NKOrange> Yup
[1:48:14] <defaultname3887> yeah thats the daily cap stuff
[1:48:18] <shadepman> yup
[1:48:19] <MountainBandits> and you only get 160
[1:48:22] <$teddygrahams82> pat is here
[1:48:23] <Mogel56> Now you are a percent closer to ascending kaeya
[1:48:28] <%cosmicleviathan18> anything good?
[1:48:31] <MountainBandits> so like 3 bosses a day
[1:48:43] <tanarath> Plague, be real careful about upgrading world levels, you can gimp yourself if you don't know about decent stats & builds for characters that you're using.
[1:48:53] <tubit> your contacts get dry perhaps
[1:48:59] <+PharosOfLight> @tanarath world levels can be lowered now
[1:49:00] <$teddygrahams82> wtfSalt
[1:49:03] <%ralphwiggum16> Goodnight sweet Plague.
[1:49:03] <defaultname3887> wait how ok is backseating here?
[1:49:06] <tanarath> REALLY
[1:49:18] <Mogel56> That one gets you closer to ascending Lisa
[1:49:20] <TheButtravage> @defaultname3887 He likely won't read it so it's fine.
[1:49:22] <brisky_lol> what is this game
[1:49:26] <defaultname3887> nice
[1:49:27] <tanarath> I quit over that, good to know.
[1:49:34] <guakomo> so you have to pay soft corency  to get loot? seems like a grindy mechanic.
[1:50:02] <tanarath> @guakomo you have to pay stamina
[1:50:26] <$teddygrahams82> what dose the white and black buttons do lol
[1:50:35] <MountainBandits> you can only down level after like adventure rank 40
[1:50:55] <%cosmicleviathan18> the cube
[1:50:59] <MountainBandits> the cube
[1:51:02] <Mogel56> This guy might be a bit tougher for you
[1:51:05] <+NKOrange> CUBE
[1:51:06] <pleochronic> for being the most basic thing imaginable i kind of love this cube
[1:51:16] <Sol_Install> oh genshin
[1:51:19] <%cosmicleviathan18> C U B E
[1:51:20] <TheButtravage> @guakomo It's almost like it's a f2p game that wants your money.
[1:51:32] <$teddygrahams82> why did the ladies like Ronald McDonald cuz he's the one with the sesame seed buns wtfDonCha
[1:51:32] <blerrger19> pretty much everything is a timed challenge tho...
[1:51:38] <+DragoonSound> G'night Plague, have a good one
[1:51:38] <Andele1503> yes
[1:51:44] <DracaenaLeaf> She applies wet when healing
[1:51:46] <+Chex868> no
[1:51:49] <defaultname3887> yeah thats why people hate barbara in everything related to ice
[1:51:54] <TheButtravage> @PlagueOfGripes Yes, everytime Barbara uses her skill it applies wet.  Wet + cryo = frozen.
[1:52:01] <+PharosOfLight> Bennette is top-tier healer though
[1:52:06] <+Skianyan> just use bennett, hes better than barbara anyways
[1:52:14] <SinisterBroccoli> There's an item you can craft that lets you use healing items in combat
[1:52:16] <defaultname3887> bennet is top tier period
[1:52:16] <Psyramics> everytime it ticks on her too
[1:52:20] <Mogel56> Eventually you'll unlock eating equip-able foods
[1:52:29] <HeroToxiko> her r2 also wets enemies so it can be useful for melle element combos
[1:52:35] <SinisterBroccoli> talents
[1:52:36] <Psyramics> no, talents
[1:52:36] <defaultname3887> talens
[1:52:39] <MountainBandits> this game gets real sloppy without having a character design to deal damage instead of support
[1:52:44] <Mogel56> The individual skills level up as well
[1:52:49] <TheButtravage> He hasn't really ascended characters so he can't really level talents.
[1:52:50] <Twoiis> He isn't high enough level to even touch talents.
[1:53:01] <AsslessChapsVEVO> Did you know that in 1642 Pope Urban VIII once banned sneezing because he deemed it "to close to sexual ecstasy?"
[1:53:02] <+Axellogic> He did the podcast first so he tired
[1:53:05] <Sol_Install> he did a podcast
[1:53:07] <Mogel56> You level them up in the talents section of the character page.
[1:53:09] <$teddygrahams82> remember never play mobile
[1:53:16] <+Ancopro> true
[1:53:21] <Andele1503> But Plague, will you stream New War when it releases?
[1:53:24] <HeroToxiko> he's such a shoto
[1:53:25] <+chance_h> Pat wants to grind offscreen
[1:53:38] <MountainBandits> i like how benny's lvl 2 is a shoryu
[1:53:40] <+Axellogic> So how do you feel about Paimon now
[1:53:40] <%cooldude69xx> @AsslessChapsVEVO Repression made manifest
[1:53:49] <TheButtravage> @PlagueOfGripes Actually, what roster of characters do you even have?
[1:53:54] <AsslessChapsVEVO> wow that is irritating
[1:54:04] <$teddygrahams82> what's pat playing
[1:54:07] <HeroToxiko> i feel like the game is implying he is magic or something but it's unclear
[1:54:10] <+NKOrange> Bennett is cursed us what he is
[1:54:10] <%cosmicleviathan18> hey guys I think Benny might be unlucky
[1:54:33] <+roderick_legend> dont worry man, with time you learn, tyt
[1:54:59] <+CelestialLancer> this is why i cant play this game in english
[1:55:01] <%cosmicleviathan18> BENNY IF YOU DON'T SHUT UP I'M GONNA SLAP YA
[1:55:06] <fruit_pie_the_magician> Yeah most of the difference is that you have to pay tons of money to make these problems go away
[1:55:19] <defaultname3887> yeah main character only has the material throu general progression
[1:55:21] <TheButtravage> @PlagueOfGripes The player character materials pretty much just come from story progress.
[1:55:24] <+Ancopro> :O a wish 5star here we go
[1:55:29] <%Gogogolem> you can claim rewards from his previous level up by teh way
[1:55:36] <$teddygrahams82> the characters are like pawns in dragons dogma  they never shut up
[1:55:45] <AsslessChapsVEVO> @PlagueOfGripes hasn't genshin's developer publicly joined the ccp?
[1:55:59] <+dante_must_die_exe> understandable
[1:56:08] <+Axellogic> is that why noone watches my streams?
[1:56:14] <Mogel56> CCP trying to crackdown on Genshin because the boys are too cute
[1:56:21] <$teddygrahams82> wtfSpin
[1:56:23] <%cosmicleviathan18> @teddygrahams82 yeah but Dogma was a good game bo8Bsmug
[1:56:32] <%cosmicleviathan18> C U B E
[1:56:39] <AsslessChapsVEVO> CUBE
[1:56:43] <%cooldude69xx> @Mogel56 Not even the CCP can stop every femboy
[1:56:44] <MountainBandits> Step 1 to fighting the CUBE
[1:56:47] <Mogel56> Cube is invincible while surrounded by other cubes.
[1:56:48] <MountainBandits> DOGDE
[1:56:56] <+Mossinoda> 777777
[1:56:59] <+NKOrange> Cube gonna clap cheeks
[1:57:00] <+lordericter> pulling for characters, the true game
[1:57:03] <TheButtravage> @cosmicleviathan18 Dogma's pretty damned flawed.  I love the game but it's not something I would call technically good.
[1:57:05] <$teddygrahams82> always do singles
[1:57:14] <+roderick_legend> is better to do 10 pulls, so you can guaranteed a 4 start item or character
[1:57:24] <+Ancopro> if you haven't you can use stardust to buy wishes/materials too
[1:57:32] <TheButtravage> @kogathemaster it does that with singles too.
[1:57:52] <+Skianyan> you should just combine them
[1:57:53] <+NKOrange> Doesn’t matter you hit at ten ether way
[1:58:10] <+Skianyan> some of the 3 stars are actually decent once upgraded
[1:58:24] <+roderick_legend> XD
[1:58:25] <+lordericter> ohhhh boy
[1:58:25] <HeroToxiko> LUL
[1:58:28] <+Ancopro> the cube is very mean
[1:58:30] <Psyramics> you can roll 5* characters and weapons now if you have the primos for it
[1:58:51] <defaultname3887> should read the tutorial, genshin is more like monster hunter world in its tutorializing
[1:58:59] <%cosmicleviathan18> Rubiks cube is victorious
[1:58:59] <voodoolawyer> its the cubes from fortnite
[1:59:04] <Mogel56> Cube is invincible while surrounded by other cubes.
[1:59:06] <MountainBandits> you cant damage it when its a CUBE
[1:59:23] <+NKOrange> snuffOmg
[1:59:31] <Paperware> Just make sure if you have enough dps, otherwise it will just heal itself
[1:59:32] <voodoolawyer> bewares of its Cubing
[1:59:38] <Mogel56> You can also dash through those lasers like a Dark Souls roll.
[1:59:49] <defaultname3887> big tells big hits
[1:59:57] <TheButtravage> @Mogel56 Genshin's iframes aren't quite that generaous though.
[2:00:12] <shadepman> this thing is animated cool
[2:00:17] <MountainBandits> gotta learn how to DODGE
[2:00:29] <$teddygrahams82> slow n lame  pat be proud
[2:00:30] <Mogel56> probably
[2:00:34] <Andele1503> @TheButtravage they are
[2:00:41] <IcanConfuse> I did...
[2:00:44] <voodoolawyer> he'd be proud of the cubes themselves
[2:00:49] <MountainBandits> you can
[2:00:51] <+Baslam> the dash has invincibility frames btw
[2:00:53] <%cosmicleviathan18> fear CUBE ztbStab
[2:00:54] <TheButtravage> @PlagueOfGripes You can still generate energy off it even if you aren't damaging it though.
[2:00:54] <pleochronic> i frames are generally alot more generous than they look
[2:00:59] <Andele1503> nah you can spam dodges and recovery overlaps with dash windup
[2:01:07] <+roderick_legend> the dash have if at the beginning of the animation
[2:01:08] <pleochronic> burst has iframes too on most characters
[2:01:37] <MountainBandits> oh he dead
[2:01:48] <Mogel56> Based column, sane way I beat this guy day 1.
[2:02:25] <Twoiis> It's mostly just a matter of learning the patterns.
[2:02:30] <Andele1503> yup, most aoes dont respect line of sight
[2:02:35] <Andele1503> especially annoying later on
[2:02:49] <pleochronic> i have never seen this
[2:02:50] <defaultname3887> o man seeing the auto camera made loose my mind
[2:02:56] <pleochronic> how generous of cube sama
[2:03:05] <Mogel56> oof
[2:03:11] <MountainBandits> LMAO
[2:03:25] <TheButtravage> @PlagueOfGripes We wouldn't expect you to understand it the first time.
[2:03:30] <%cosmicleviathan18> CUBE is tired of cheese
[2:03:30] <$teddygrahams82> brb going to play a 9 hole round in everybody's golf
[2:03:36] <blerrger19> you've got the right idea though and using a pyro as your main dps is a good choice for this boss
[2:03:51] <Psyramics> they have a 5 min respawn timer
[2:03:52] <Mogel56> re-pops after like 10 minutes or something
[2:04:00] <blerrger19> You've seen how nasty ice being used against you is, imagine using those same elemental reactions against the bosses LUL
[2:04:28] <+roderick_legend> they heal you
[2:04:29] <Psyramics> they do
[2:04:34] <TheButtravage> They do heal you lol
[2:04:35] <Mogel56> They do lol
[2:04:38] <+Ancopro> they should
[2:04:40] <MountainBandits> They do
[2:04:41] <pleochronic> you can set it to via the blessing
[2:04:43] <KatabolicRage> you have to set them to heal you to 100
[2:04:45] <Andele1503> @blerrger19 Ah yes, using freeze against bosses, Boss:*doesnt stun nor shatter only gets crit buff*
[2:04:52] <KatabolicRage> crank auto recover to 100%
[2:04:59] <KatabolicRage> dunno why it bothers defaulting to 50
[2:04:59] <+Jiggisnipe> change your auto recover to 100%
[2:05:00] <Mogel56> You gotta set how much you want it to heal you
[2:05:02] <MountainBandits> put it up to 100%
[2:05:09] <BreakerDS> Just walk back and forth
[2:05:16] <Psyramics> open it back up and read it again
[2:05:25] <SinisterBroccoli> turn that all the wway up
[2:05:28] <TheButtravage> Set auto to 100% heal.
[2:05:31] <+Jiggisnipe> there you go
[2:05:34] <+roderick_legend> move out of rangeset to 100%
[2:05:35] <Mogel56> Won't heal you more than 50 because that's what it was set too.
[2:05:52] <Psyramics> cause some characters get bonuses at low level
[2:05:52] <TheButtravage> Because it has a limited resources that regenerates over time.
[2:05:56] <defaultname3887> certain character and to save it up
[2:05:59] <BreakerDS> Some characters like Hu Tao like being below 50%, some characters eat up all that HP
[2:06:02] <blerrger19> Chat over here be like "in hindsight everything makes perfect sense! gah! stop being pedantic!"
[2:06:14] <Mogel56> There's some high HP builds that just sap the healing resource to 0.
[2:06:31] <defaultname3887> zhonli fat 50 hp instakilling theese statues
[2:06:39] <+Jiggisnipe> ^
[2:06:50] <Psyramics> that is the threshold it will heal your health up to
[2:06:51] <+Mossinoda> exactly
[2:06:52] <pleochronic> yeah
[2:06:54] <BreakerDS> YEP, each character would be at 10% minimum
[2:06:54] <+Jiggisnipe> yep you got it
[2:06:55] <Mogel56> yeah pretty much
[2:06:56] <tubit> ye
[2:06:56] <+roderick_legend> yep
[2:06:57] <Astrodoughnaut> yes
[2:07:01] <+NKOrange> Yup
[2:07:02] <TheButtravage> Yes, the percent you set it to is the cap.
[2:07:07] <MountainBandits> yes
[2:07:08] <$teddygrahams82> I don't know how to play  genshin at all
[2:07:08] <+roderick_legend> set it to 100% and forget about it lol
[2:07:16] <%cosmicleviathan18> plagueWut
[2:07:26] <MountainBandits> it took me 2 months
[2:07:42] <+Jiggisnipe> it does have a lot of systems
[2:07:56] <eristhanewood> kick it a 50$
[2:07:57] <MountainBandits> oh boy this boss fight
[2:07:59] <pleochronic> the depths of bullshit that open up in late game kind of demand it, obfuscation aside
[2:08:02] <+NKOrange> snuffClown
[2:08:09] <+Mossinoda> he says his wallet magically flies open and the credit card number types itself
[2:08:22] <TheButtravage> @PlagueOfGripes It will explain base mechanics to the player but doesn't go into depth.  I assume this is because the players know how the game works better than the devs.\
[2:08:22] <+lordericter> its got real bad gacha rates
[2:08:26] <defaultname3887> 12 dollars every 40 days is more than enough for me
[2:08:28] <+roderick_legend> you dont have to spend money to get primo, you will get a lot by just exploring out
[2:08:30] <+lordericter> in terms of buying into currency
[2:08:44] <+polothegreatest> Also low % drop
[2:08:45] <+Mossinoda> and genesis crystals
[2:08:47] <%mustachegolem> another chatter said it was 13 currencies
[2:08:48] <+barrakuta371> oh yeah the monetization is aggressive
[2:08:50] <+Jiggisnipe> I can only justify the Welkin and the BP
[2:09:01] <Andele1503> 8, 12 if you include in game ones players can just buy (not counting elemental upgrade items and ranks of them as separate).
[2:09:08] <+Jiggisnipe> the genesis crystals conversion rate are awful
[2:09:11] <holydeviant1> Even FGO has better monetization! It's goddamn absurd, this is next-level obfuscation
[2:09:12] <+barrakuta371> Welkin is the only thing that it somewhat worth it
[2:09:15] <KatabolicRage> it has the traditional system of disassociating real money with their fancy ingame currency by making it has like 3 layers you go down so you don't immediately see how much your spending on it
[2:09:15] <+chance_h> Glad to know they added more currencies after a year lol
[2:09:17] <$livlinn> woolieOMG
[2:09:20] <$teddygrahams82> vicksyBoom
[2:09:21] <Mogel56> That barbara swimsuit used to be free with an event.
[2:09:27] <+lordericter> wowwww that fuckin sucks
[2:09:29] <+NKOrange> Welkin is the only thing worth buying
[2:09:33] <TheButtravage> @chance_h They are pretty much the exact same.
[2:09:35] <+DamnFineCupofStreaming> man thats awful
[2:09:36] <Psyramics> is 40.5 rolls
[2:09:40] <+Jiggisnipe> and remember that's with the 1st time bonus
[2:09:41] <blerrger19> tl;dr too many currencies, obfuscation of value is rampant, and not enough free pulls
[2:09:41] <DracaenaLeaf> Welkin Moon is the only good deal
[2:09:42] <+polothegreatest> Amazon gives you items as bonus
[2:09:58] <+Skianyan> "plus bonus 6480"
[2:09:59] <@Nightbot> Plague is a youtube animator and also streams at https://picarto.tv/Plague . Also: t-shirts! http://goo.gl/lze8QO
[2:10:06] <holydeviant1> The only thing that has any decent value is the monthly login-bonus-boost.
[2:10:17] <Psyramics> its about half a 5*
[2:10:27] <Andele1503> TLDR: You need betwee 1.4k to 3.3k USD to max out ONE character
[2:10:30] <%JailShmixRemix> Aren't the 5* rates like less than 1%
[2:10:31] <blerrger19> Only 10 pulls matter
[2:10:33] <MountainBandits> you need 90 rolls to garentee a 5 star
[2:10:36] <Reisadan> omg i'm gonna have nightmares about discrete mathematics because of this!
[2:10:37] <TheButtravage> Yes, on average every 9/10 rolls are crap.
[2:10:40] <$teddygrahams82> so is it like darksouls weapons paths
[2:10:42] <MountainBandits> so not even a 100$
[2:10:44] <+Skianyan> every 10th pull is guaranteed a 4, yeah
[2:10:52] <TheButtravage> @PlagueOfGripes Nope, level and accoutn level have no impact on gatcha rolls.
[2:11:00] <blerrger19> @JailShmixRemix that's standard for most gacha
[2:11:11] <MountainBandits> yup
[2:11:17] <Mekiah> on the event banner at least 2 would be guaranteed chars
[2:11:17] <Mogel56> 100% right
[2:11:18] <KatabolicRage> the point of so many currencies that are layered on top of each other like this is to mentally dis-associate what your spending from the real money cost so you don't go "JESUS I JUST SPENT 100 BUCKS ON NOTHING"
[2:11:21] <+roderick_legend> considering you have nothing now, is still useful
[2:11:25] <Dreigun> the only thing I was able to justify spending money on was the welkin thing
[2:11:28] <defaultname3887> actually genshin is more towards the nice gachas due to guarantees wich is insane
[2:11:28] <TheButtravage> Depends on the banner you pull on.
[2:11:35] <CyberDingus> PixelBob Don't spend, just grind.
[2:11:39] <SinisterBroccoli> but waifus
[2:11:40] <+Jiggisnipe> without the 1st time bonus, the $100 option gets you 6480+1600 crystals, so it's 100$ for 50 rolls
[2:11:40] <Andele1503> @blerrger19 not true, its only true for whale mobile gacha
[2:11:42] <blerrger19> you could spend $100 on basically nothing or buy Elden Ring
[2:11:42] <+Skianyan> the welkin thing is so much better by comparison
[2:11:44] <Psyramics> welkin is pretty good value, only $5 for 300 genesis and 2700 primos
[2:11:53] <MountainBandits> but big thigh snow lady tho
[2:11:54] <eristhanewood> Genshin is actually one of the "good" gacha systems
[2:11:59] <+TopTieramisu> Breath of the Whales
[2:12:04] <holydeviant1> This ain't FG where you unlock new characters because PLOT
[2:12:04] <blerrger19> @Andele1503 ok
[2:12:07] <+roderick_legend> you are making it look way more complicated than it is man XD
[2:12:07] <+chance_h> What’s worst is that duplicate character rolles are used to give a minor power up. So your rolls get worst over time
[2:12:10] <Mogel56> nope they want you to spend as much as possible as soon as possible.
[2:12:11] <Hyphen_Sum> Welkin waaay between than Genesis Crystal buying but Free to Play is wisest
[2:12:17] <eristhanewood> most currencies are not 1:1 ratio
[2:12:18] <pleochronic> starglitter is more pity, not really functionally a currency, which is really strange
[2:12:19] <Andele1503> @eristhanewood Its literally worse than FGO, and FGO is among the worst
[2:12:20] <hollowedsilence> Nope, just awful ring
[2:12:20] <ShinBojangles> once you reach 75 rolls from your last 5 star the chances of getting a 5 star increase drastically
[2:12:22] <tubit> obfuscate and hope you make a mistake so you have to rebuy stuff
[2:12:28] <blerrger19> @Dreigun except you lose it if you don't log in and claim it LUL
[2:12:28] <%JailShmixRemix> Predatory Currency systems plaguePog plaguePog plaguePog plaguePog plaguePog plaguePog plaguePog plaguePog plaguePog
[2:12:33] <hollowedsilence> *rng
[2:12:36] <blerrger19> @eristhanewood LUL
[2:12:36] <holydeviant1> The blessing is actually okay value, only thing that is.
[2:12:55] <Mogel56> Like didnt Pat spend around 300$ when the game released to just "see" what the rolls were like.
[2:12:56] <+lordericter> Ahh its a monthly pass, Hong Kong and Chinese games love these
[2:12:59] <%DCR1311> DCR1311 subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 3 months, currently on a 3 month streak! Hello
[2:13:10] <+Skianyan> 30 rolls for 5 bucks?
[2:13:13] <TheButtravage> @PlagueOfGripes Heads up, rolling on character banners will more than likely give 4 and 5 star characters, while rolling on the weapon banner will likely give you weapons.  You can still get the opposite but the chances are lower.  Standard banner is pretty much anything.
[2:13:16] <MountainBandits> The 5 dollars a month deal is calculated so even with doing the daily commission will only put you at a 150 gems a day, 10 gems short of an actual roll
[2:13:23] <$teddygrahams82> am broke cause Xmas
[2:13:34] <blerrger19> @MountainBandits LUL
[2:13:55] <+Jiggisnipe> @MountainBandits well you get 300 crystals which fills the gap but yea
[2:13:58] <Mekiah> for long term savers welkin beefs up your savings pretty well
[2:13:59] <+lordericter> and you have to log in EVERY DAY with the Welkin
[2:14:00] <KatabolicRage> Genshin just gets a pass from a lot of people because there's an actual game attached to the gacha bullshit
[2:14:03] <holydeviant1> *heavy sigh* at least the porn's alright
[2:14:06] <tubit> it's pretty much pure evil
[2:14:06] <TheButtravage> @PlagueOfGripes Yeah, it's kind of common practive for F2p games to money gouge.
[2:14:22] <defaultname3887> look at the history tab
[2:14:24] <kaldalt> sorry you were on my recommended streamer are you "that" pokemon video guy?
[2:14:29] <SinisterBroccoli> each banner has it's own pity
[2:14:30] <+Baslam> the standard banner and the character banner don't share pity thats why
[2:14:32] <TheButtravage> @PlagueOfGripes The pity is per banner.
[2:14:37] <MountainBandits> never do standard
[2:14:38] <+NKOrange> Each banner has its own pity
[2:14:43] <+Mossinoda> was it twelve on the same banner? Cuz if so then you aren't guaranteed a four star
[2:14:45] <BreakerDS> Character Banner - Weapon Banner - Standard Banner all have separate pity
[2:14:47] <+Mossinoda> are*
[2:14:50] <GeltonZ> Gripes likes griping?! SHOCK!
[2:15:02] <TheButtravage> @PlagueOfGripes And yeah, never spend primos on standard banner, just spend on special banners.
[2:15:03] <Mogel56> The Eula banner is better in my opinion, but that is because she's my main.
[2:15:05] <ShinBojangles> wtf i thought both banners have a shared pity
[2:15:06] <pleochronic> time for morphine dragon
[2:15:08] <Andele1503> @TheButtravage Its still impressive for a game worse than FGO in how greedy and predatory designed it is to be that popular
[2:15:32] <+roderick_legend> is not, it really isnt, he is just making it look worst than it is
[2:15:34] <ShinBojangles> is chat sure about both limited banners having separate pity?
[2:15:43] <holydeviant1> I mean, at least the characters are pretty? And the combat systems are fun. But really, that monetization, man
[2:15:48] <%JailShmixRemix> it 100% is predatory
[2:15:50] <+Baslam> limited character banners do share pity
[2:15:51] <+Mossinoda> the two limited banners share a pity
[2:15:55] <%JailShmixRemix> Idk about more predatory than FGO, but
[2:15:56] <MountainBandits> @TheButtravage it makes sense when you realize this is the gacha game with the most "gameplay" in it
[2:16:00] <ShinBojangles> yeah ok thought so
[2:16:12] <Psyramics> you can switch between them when there's two, they share pity
[2:16:15] <defaultname3887> i've yet to see something more predatory than fgo
[2:16:20] <+Mossinoda> Hope you enjoy this minigame Plague, because once it's over you will NEVER get to do it again
[2:16:25] <+lordericter> a schmup level?
[2:16:29] <Hyphen_Sum> yes
[2:16:30] <pleochronic> yeah
[2:16:32] <+Skianyan> there is a history tab, yes
[2:16:32] <%JailShmixRemix> I've seen more predatory, but in some pretty niche games
[2:16:33] <BreakerDS> @ShinBojangles the current Albedo/Eula, Weapon and Standard banner have their own pity
[2:16:38] <pleochronic> the history takes a bit to update though
[2:16:38] <TheButtravage> @PlagueOfGripes Yes, there is a history button.
[2:16:39] <$teddygrahams82> is this hack gu lol
[2:16:46] <+TopTieramisu> i was told this game was similar to BotW
[2:16:47] <%cosmicleviathan18> ok this looks kinda dumb LUL
[2:16:49] <ShinBojangles> you can look at your roll history but it takes like 10 mins or something to update.
[2:16:50] <Mogel56> The game has a history for all your roles so you can count everything out.
[2:17:01] <Mekiah> the history tab is shite, they need a solid just # counter
[2:17:11] <BreakerDS> There is a history button, but I takes a while to update so your most recent wishes that day won't show up
[2:17:18] <TheButtravage> @TopTieramisu Mechanically, it is.  It's a worse BoTW with a more complex combat system.
[2:17:26] <MountainBandits> god this story section of boss fight sucks
[2:17:36] <MountainBandits> im glad its not in the trounce domain
[2:17:41] <$teddygrahams82> looks like a hack. gu
[2:17:50] <+TopTieramisu> @TopTieramisu i did feel BotW was lacking in the combat segment. but it's best quality wasn't the combat anyways
[2:18:00] <pleochronic> skeith is the only cool avatar
[2:18:19] <%JailShmixRemix> LOL
[2:18:28] <+sasparillatango> because you're a plane now
[2:18:32] <Mogel56> Inverted like a plane lol
[2:18:42] <+lordericter> gotta love forced inversion because flying section
[2:18:50] <%JailShmixRemix> you've always been a plane in ours hearts
[2:18:55] <$teddygrahams82> mangus
[2:18:56] <%cosmicleviathan18> this kinda sucks tbh
[2:19:00] <PonchoPronto> lv. 40 in 3 days, wonder what the cap is
[2:19:16] <TheButtravage> @PlagueOfGripes Fortunately you don't eve have to do this ever again.
[2:19:19] <PonchoPronto> and how hard it scales toward the end OpieOP
[2:19:31] <Andele1503> I still dont get why people think inverted controls are like a plane, on engine lever scheme up is still movement up for plane
[2:19:32] <Mogel56> This is the only time you'll ever see this mechanic.
[2:20:02] <TheButtravage> @PonchoPronto Character levels don't really do much in telling gameplay teim, account level is the one that does it.
[2:20:04] <%JailShmixRemix> Chat why is plague playing genshin in the first place
[2:20:13] <%JailShmixRemix> i missed day 1 and 2
[2:20:14] <guakomo> genshin sneakily made you play a shmup lol.
[2:20:22] <TheButtravage> @JailShmixRemix He said because it was free.
[2:20:25] <blerrger19> @Andele1503 "nosedive" would be my guess
[2:20:26] <$teddygrahams82> the menu are carzy on controls
[2:20:29] <+Jiggisnipe> he said cuz it's free
[2:20:32] <%JailShmixRemix> understandable
[2:20:35] <PonchoPronto> ah alright ravage
[2:20:35] <+ClericOfSparda> t101GANB t101ATTE
[2:20:52] <+TopTieramisu> seems like dodging is more a suggestion than a necessity
[2:21:11] <%cosmicleviathan18> aye what are we drawing next stream?! plaguePog
[2:21:13] <eristhanewood> first time?
[2:21:18] <+lordericter> This sure is a PS2 fight
[2:21:18] <TheButtravage> @TopTieramisu YEah, this section isn't the actual fight.
[2:21:23] <Mogel56> Front one is for next phase
[2:21:24] <pleochronic> eastern dragons are predisposed, of course
[2:21:25] <MountainBandits> i think the first alright bossfight is childe in my opinion
[2:21:26] <+ParadisusFalls> Don't worry, it'll never happen again
[2:21:26] <%RothurThePaladin> plaguePog
[2:21:44] <%JailShmixRemix> Venti plaguePog plaguePog plaguePog plaguePog plaguePog plaguePog plaguePog
[2:22:15] <+lordericter> ah yes Venti, the Chinese governments arch enemy
[2:22:15] <$teddygrahams82> yep anime
[2:22:23] <+TopTieramisu> oh yeah, this is very BOTW
[2:22:25] <%JailShmixRemix> plaguePog  Venti plaguePog plaguePog
[2:22:34] <Mogel56> I hated this fight the first time through.
[2:22:37] <eristhanewood> little trial tease
[2:22:50] <MountainBandits> yep
[2:22:51] <+ParadisusFalls> too bad every character is limited, so you can't actually get  him
[2:22:52] <Mogel56> Venti's banner was ongoing on release
[2:23:00] <+Mossinoda> every gacha does this
[2:23:04] <TheButtravage> @PlagueOfGripes Guess what, a lot of characters you can't get unless it's specifically a banner for them.  Like venti for example.
[2:23:13] <%JailShmixRemix> Thank goodness I pulled venti on my 2nd multi, so I never spent money on this game lol
[2:23:15] <HeroToxiko> that
[2:23:23] <pleochronic> to the point that it feels like it sacrificed its pacing for sales with 2.1 apparently
[2:23:34] <+lordericter> aim for the glowy target
[2:23:37] <%cosmicleviathan18> are we firing feathers?!
[2:23:52] <resinite709> it exposes its whale dick
[2:24:04] <skeletonkingofmanlets> ummm
[2:24:07] <+TopTieramisu> now does this game have any cool physics tricks like BotW?
[2:24:08] <+ParadisusFalls> It's also messed up because they give you Venti here with a couple Constellations so hes more powerful than you actually can get him
[2:24:13] <skeletonkingofmanlets> this song sounds familiar....
[2:24:15] <%JailShmixRemix> D: venti is too cute to be annoying
[2:24:17] <HeroToxiko> you can hit things from a fair distance
[2:24:35] <skeletonkingofmanlets> something from nier....
[2:24:38] <+Jiggisnipe> yea lol
[2:24:46] <Mogel56> Venti yeets enemies into the air with his skill and gathers with his ult.
[2:24:47] <+lordericter> the platform is murdering you
[2:24:47] <blerrger19> floor is lava
[2:24:53] <ShinBojangles> you can climb him
[2:24:53] <$teddygrahams82> what type of dragons don't have legs and can't see.   ohh
[2:24:54] <Mogel56> useless for this fight
[2:24:54] <blerrger19> @PlagueOfGripes floor is lava
[2:24:54] <MountainBandits> the skyrim effect
[2:24:55] <+TopTieramisu> LUL
[2:24:56] <eristhanewood> you used to be able to do a falling attack sideways and use it to travel
[2:24:58] <$Vampireinarm> get stomped on
[2:25:00] <%cosmicleviathan18> plagueWut plagueWut plagueWut
[2:25:03] <pleochronic> almost beat the floor dot
[2:25:04] <TheButtravage> lmao
[2:25:04] <resinite709> you did it yay!
[2:25:06] <eristhanewood> not sure if you still can or not
[2:25:07] <ShinBojangles> IT JUST WORKS
[2:25:15] <+Jiggisnipe> you can, you shoot an arrow from across the map and kill some pigeons
[2:25:16] <+lordericter> he said you needed to leave the platform when it started the big attack
[2:25:25] <Psyramics> yes there was
[2:25:26] <+Mossinoda> plague the game told you...
[2:25:30] <+lordericter> also the floor started glowing and cracking
[2:25:30] <Mogel56> Floor was "cracked"
[2:25:34] <Hyphen_Sum> big glowing cracks
[2:25:34] <blerrger19> LUL
[2:25:34] <BreakerDS> There was text and they said it
[2:25:41] <ShinBojangles> yeah the cracks are pretty ambiguous
[2:25:42] <Psyramics> streamer tax in full force
[2:25:45] <TheButtravage> @PlagueOfGripes You were getting hit by anemo ticks, you were supposed to change platforms lol
[2:25:47] <%cosmicleviathan18> that voice LUL LUL LUL
[2:25:57] <SweetCheeksTVR> 48 raiders from SweetCheeksTVR have joined! 
[2:26:09] <$DensityD> Good raid is here! sweetc2POGGERS
[2:26:14] <$teddygrahams82> tells better stories then dbz
[2:26:15] <%cosmicleviathan18> HypeShield HypeShield HypeShield HypeShield HypeShield HypeShield HypeShield HypeShield HypeShield HypeShield
[2:26:18] <$Vampireinarm> theres a whole room of platforms lol
[2:26:23] <Psyramics> there was a ring of platforms you're supposed to switch to when the floor goes aggro
[2:26:23] <+wizard_of_diamonds> Why is the English VA'ing so subpar
[2:26:32] <biglomix> is there any weird chinese propaganda in this?
[2:26:35] <SweetCheeksTVR> ewww, freedom!
[2:26:35] <+Jiggisnipe> freedom loving drunks Kappa
[2:26:40] <+lordericter> oh hi Jeanne of Arc
[2:26:44] <MountainBandits> literally has no government
[2:26:45] <daeft_> freedom? disgusting!
[2:26:46] <+ParadisusFalls> @biglomix The entirety of Liyue
[2:26:47] <dark_raven_01> sweetc2POGGERS
[2:26:49] <+wizard_of_diamonds> You'd think the parent company would have enough money to shell out for decent VA'ing LUL
[2:26:50] <$Vampireinarm> its not good at all lol
[2:26:51] <HeroToxiko> @biglomix the opposite kinda
[2:26:53] <KatabolicRage> the devs, chinese though they may be, are massive weebs
[2:26:54] <Mogel56> There were wind vents that appeared on the edges so you could've changed platforms. I don't bother doing that for the repeatable version of this fight anymore though.
[2:26:59] <eristhanewood> its trying so hard
[2:27:01] <shadepman> that was so epic
[2:27:05] <+Jiggisnipe> LUL
[2:27:09] <+roderick_legend> great you beat the tutorial Plague
[2:27:21] <$teddygrahams82> dragon heart
[2:27:31] <Mogel56> Genshin? Clever? No way
[2:27:33] <$Vampireinarm> If they are in the gacha they have giga plot armor and nothing will ever happen to them
[2:27:43] <$DensityD> why would anything ever be3 clever. why would anthing ever be good?
[2:27:43] <TheButtravage> @PlagueOfGripes Nah, you just have exceptional timing.
[2:27:43] <+lordericter> Paimon soup
[2:27:48] <+Mossinoda> ayo
[2:27:50] <SanityIs_Overrated> paimon is emergancy food

[2:28:44] <$teddygrahams82> it's true  she's lame
[2:28:53] <pleochronic> the appeal of jean is her obscenely violent gameplay, though that requires actually getting her

[2:32:12] <Erwin_Dedic> Clearly those legs have atrophied from years of unuse.
[2:32:14] <+NickHatesSnow> She's food
[2:32:16] <+ClericOfSparda> The Dev team really doesn't know what they want to do with her
[2:32:19] <TimetodiveLTX> just like real life
[2:32:22] <%cosmicleviathan18> she exists
[2:32:24] <SweetCheeksTVR> she's comic relief
[2:32:28] <MountainBandits> the incompetence of genshin characters in doing their job is actually hilarious
[2:32:31] <+Jiggisnipe> she's a goofy mascot
[2:32:35] <$DensityD> should have been a dragon quest slime, not a fairy girl
[2:32:35] <SuperVaderMan> is she treated like a lalafell
[2:32:38] <Mantisprayer> Paimon is paimon... her own words

[2:34:06] <+NKOrange> Facts
[2:34:11] <%BlackMage66652> Paimon has a dumptruck
[2:34:24] <+Mossinoda> paimon likes food and money, that's her in a nutshell
[2:34:25] <+TopTieramisu> she's navi?
[2:34:26] <+lordericter> mascot characters always love food
[2:34:29] <$teddygrahams82> so is BUCKET OF CRAB MASH
[2:34:30] <TheButtravage> Dumb glutton.
[2:34:30] <+PlushMines> she's also greedy!
[2:34:31] <MountainBandits> also obsess with money
[2:34:37] <Psyramics> thats fan speculation
[2:34:38] <TimetodiveLTX> that's nice
[2:34:41] <TheButtravage> I think that's more a fan theory.
[2:34:45] <%cosmicleviathan18> ah yes the always hungry trope ryboogFace
[2:34:47] <+Jiggisnipe> nothing has been confirmed and that's fan theory
[2:34:57] <$DensityD> the most sitcom filler of any filler
[2:34:57] <Mogel56> Gatcha game dialogue lmao
[2:34:58] <SweetCheeksTVR> oh you don't even KNOW
[2:34:58] <Samex_Comex> I like food too
[2:35:08] <+TopTieramisu> who doesn't like food?
[2:35:10] <ShinBojangles> filler dialogue
[2:35:10] <eristhanewood> welcome good hunter
[2:35:15] <+NickHatesSnow> Would Paimon be considered poultry or seafood since you found her in the ocean?
[2:35:16] <%cosmicleviathan18> CLEAN UP WHAT?!
[2:35:28] <%cosmicleviathan18> THERE'S NOTHING HERE!!!
[2:35:30] <MountainBandits> "hey we fought a godscend dragon, lets have lunch i like lunch do you want lunch?"
[2:35:32] <$teddygrahams82> wtfSpin
[2:35:32] <ShinBojangles> eat that blood
[2:35:33] <%JailShmixRemix> Paimon is definitely poultry
[2:35:34] <$livlinn> Cant anger papa Pooh I guess
[2:35:35] <+Jiggisnipe> city got attacked

[2:35:40] <Mogel56> Trolls invaded off screen
[2:35:41] <%BlackMage66652> Plague's fursona with a big smile on his face is more creepy than anything in Silent Hill
[2:35:52] <$DensityD> I've got to.  # # get away
[2:36:00] <+TopTieramisu> :D
[2:36:09] <+NickHatesSnow> @jailshmixremix Yeah I guess a chicken in the ocean is a chicken not a fish
[2:36:12] <$DensityD> ooo tainted blood
[2:36:13] <eristhanewood> he gets really really angry if you kill one infront o fhim
[2:36:19] <+Jiggisnipe> Plague isn't paying attention to the story. He's too busy laughing at his vtuber model glitching out
[2:36:20] <Samex_Comex> They are his only friends
[2:36:25] <Twoiis> I love failing Timmies quest.
[2:36:29] <Mogel56> He's a sad sad orphan.
[2:36:32] <ShinBojangles> throw him into the lake
[2:36:39] <+polothegreatest> Oh sht
[2:36:42] <dark_raven_01> he never came back with the milk
[2:36:44] <+hirohideki> So fucked up lol
[2:36:47] <$DensityD> that was a 5x "maybe" combo
[2:36:49] <$livlinn> prenY
[2:36:52] <TheButtravage> @PlagueOfGripes You can kill hits birbs btw.
[2:36:56] <Samex_Comex> The pigeons carried his dad away
[2:37:00] <$DensityD> HahaGingercat
[2:37:03] <Hyphen_Sum> Pigeons really needed those smokes
[2:37:04] <+Jiggisnipe> I think most players loled at that line from Timmy
[2:37:04] <+ClericOfSparda> Like his daddy
[2:37:08] <+polothegreatest> those middleage cigars
[2:37:11] <tubit> BibleThump
[2:37:13] <SuperVaderMan> man fuck timmie
[2:37:16] <%cosmicleviathan18> pigeons ate his dad
[2:37:17] <Mantisprayer> just like daddy!
[2:37:20] <blerrger19> lmao
[2:37:25] <$teddygrahams82> isn't England fall if the birds leave?
[2:37:29] <$DensityD> padoru padoru
[2:37:30] <SweetCheeksTVR> there is LITERALLY a quest later on in the game where you accompany a LEGAL CONSULTANT while SHE does HER OWN QUEST, which is all about some lady's legal agreement she cot caught up in. You literally do nothing to further the quest as a player. You just press x the entire time.
[2:37:39] <Mogel56> Timmy and his pigeons are a daily quest you can randomly get.
[2:37:47] <%BlackMage66652> Is Cyrus from Transylvania?
[2:37:56] <MountainBandits> why did they give him a schnezian accent in english?
[2:38:07] <$DensityD> sweet spot of negative space
[2:38:07] <SweetCheeksTVR> yeah iphone face tracking is weird.
[2:38:13] <Briskp> you look like your climaxing lol
[2:38:43] <ShinBojangles> Cyrus is the best character in this game
[2:38:44] <%cosmicleviathan18> the pigeons are a hive mind of Timmy's dad bo8Thyper
[2:38:48] <SweetCheeksTVR> ah
[2:38:50] <skeletonkingofmanlets> ~time to trim that hobostache Plague
[2:38:53] <pleochronic> i would argue the mundane bullshit is thematically very important, but yeah its ehhhh
[2:39:00] <SweetCheeksTVR> I've been spoiled by Witcher 3 quests
[2:39:01] <Mogel56> Quests literally go hey player read this dialogue and then quest ocmplete.
[2:39:03] <+Mossinoda> on the bright side, they're quick and easy. On the other hand, it makes the npcs useless and incompetent
[2:39:17] <%BlackMage66652> Plague's true fursona
[2:39:21] <$livlinn> Awwwwww
[2:39:25] <+roderick_legend> thats is so adorable, how dare you
[2:39:39] <blerrger19> The weird thing that bothers me about quests is some require to you kill multiple waves of enemies, groups of 10 at a time or something, and some require you to solve complex puzzles, and others require you to kill a single group of enemies or solve a relatively simple puzzle. Either way you get 10 primos
[2:39:47] <Mantisprayer> Yeah newbies, let's go take on a dragon!
[2:39:53] <$teddygrahams82> baby mama lynx gonna catch you 5 rabbits
[2:40:04] <Mogel56> It's magic shhhhh
[2:40:05] <TimetodiveLTX> dragon in a ""petersonian"" sense, of course
[2:40:13] <+Jiggisnipe> magic monocle
[2:40:14] <KatabolicRage> I think real monacles are kinda pinched between your brow and cheek?
[2:40:22] <KatabolicRage> you gotta kinda hold it there with your eyebrow
[2:40:30] <KatabolicRage> thats why they have a chain incase y ou drop it

[2:44:56] <Mogel56> She was introduced as "maybe evil"
[2:44:57] <+Mossinoda> She's the party drow rogue
[2:45:10] <TheButtravage> @PlagueOfGripes She's also not a good nun.  She can't remember the name of the God she worships correctly.
[2:45:26] <%mustachegolem> they are all too noodly
[2:45:28] <MountainBandits> genshin characters are incompetant
[2:45:30] <+whyskeywolfe> There's no Lulu's?

[2:45:43] <+Mossinoda> Xinyan?? PogChamp
[2:45:44] <ShinBojangles> did you look at them in the character archive and look at their idle's?
[2:45:44] <Hyphen_Sum> Xinyan
[2:45:44] <+roderick_legend> shup up Xinyan is amazing XD
[2:45:45] <SweetCheeksTVR> rockstar girl?

[2:45:48] <TheButtravage> @PlagueOfGripes Beidou?
[2:45:59] <blerrger19> chat the hint was she's not good
[2:46:02] <$teddygrahams82> I don't know names of anyone
[2:46:07] <+Skianyan> shes my main, i love she
[2:46:11] <blerrger19> Xinyan is bad?
[2:46:24] <TimetodiveLTX> get on those bunker dollars
[2:46:29] <eristhanewood> No i got it wrong i didnt catch the context
[2:46:33] <Hyphen_Sum> She looks like a saiyan girl
[2:46:36] <+Mossinoda> Xinyan's not bad per se, she just has a very confused skill kit
[2:46:37] <BreakerDS> Xinyan has niche uses, she deserves better
[2:46:38] <SweetCheeksTVR> which one is xinyan?
[2:46:45] <Mantisprayer> I like Xinyan, but her splitscaling is not great.
[2:46:47] <Psyramics> the pyro rocker girl
[2:46:48] <TheButtravage> @SweetCheeksTVR Rock n roll girl
[2:46:50] <blerrger19> C6 Xinyan, spin2win ez
[2:46:53] <MountainBandits> i think you can look at her in the character archive
[2:46:54] <Mogel56> Xinyan is both trash kit wise and bugged lol
[2:46:56] <+Mossinoda> xinyan and kaeya
[2:47:00] <SweetCheeksTVR> ah ok. I got it right then. lol
[2:47:01] <pleochronic> her split scaling isn't really relevant cause her barrier is just to start her spinning
[2:47:04] <TheButtravage> It's just Kaeya and Xinyan.
[2:47:10] <%cosmicleviathan18> I just looked her hell yeah I'd be down plagueHarkness
[2:47:13] <+NKOrange> She’s not great and that’s a crime
[2:47:15] <skeletonkingofmanlets> genshin girls look dangerously young
[2:47:30] <Mantisprayer> Just Rosaria lmao
[2:47:33] <ShinBojangles> have you seen shenhe and itto?
[2:47:35] <tubit> the church police
[2:47:43] <BreakerDS> Down the line, with more regions, we'll get more melanin in the characters
[2:47:45] <$livlinn> woolieOMG
[2:47:48] <MountainBandits> quivering cat lips
[2:47:49] <$teddygrahams82> question why the nun
[2:47:51] <%cosmicleviathan18> don't mind us sister plagueHarkness
[2:48:01] <Mantisprayer> Grace is Timmie's caretaker/mom i think
[2:48:22] <%mustachegolem> I like his cape
[2:48:23] <ShinBojangles> @breakerds you forget the part where you need genesis crystals to buy melanin LUL
[2:48:30] <Samex_Comex> Why is that guy in the fountain
[2:48:31] <%cosmicleviathan18> this guy wants to bang doesn't he?
[2:48:41] <+NKOrange> Based on the Genshin comic they have you’d think more of mondstat should be
[2:48:43] <MountainBandits> hes taking wishing coins
[2:48:46] <Mogel56> Paimon sick of his shit too
[2:48:55] <+Mossinoda> I have no faith that sumeru will have more melanin
[2:49:02] <$teddygrahams82> tagnSAGAT do you like cornflakes
[2:49:02] <blerrger19> Oh the fountain is a joke about the gacha LUL
[2:49:05] <Mogel56> He's one of the random dailies
[2:49:14] <MountainBandits> mondstat does not approve of universal healthcare
[2:49:20] <Mantisprayer> There is a quest I think maybe it was a daily?
[2:49:21] <TheButtravage> @PlagueOfGripes I built Xinyan recently and enjoyed her performance.  She really picks up at Constellation 2 with Sacraficial Sword so that she can constantly keep her shield up.
[2:49:21] <MountainBandits> you get sick you die
[2:49:46] <TimetodiveLTX> being an orphan hits different when your parents are in a dozen different places
[2:49:46] <Mogel56> They don't matter until the daily RNG says you get their quest.
[2:49:47] <SuperVaderMan> that's sad, guy so desperate to help his sister he scrounges out of a fountain
[2:50:18] <$teddygrahams82> raccoons
[2:50:48] <TimetodiveLTX> paimon's voice isn't as bad as i was lead to believe
[2:50:50] <+roderick_legend> he is just  bartender
[2:50:53] <TheButtravage> @PlagueOfGripes Also Xinyan has no story presence so far.  The only significant time we get with her character was a limited event that featured her recently.
[2:50:54] <Mantisprayer> Varka... we know very little about him
[2:50:54] <MountainBandits> no red hair is batman
[2:50:57] <Hyphen_Sum> He's out of the country
[2:51:03] <+whyskeywolfe> I bet you it'll be a dude, with a dick and balls who farts and swears and stuff.
[2:51:07] <TheButtravage> Nah, red head runs the winery.
[2:51:09] <ShinBojangles> grandmaster has some lore out there
[2:51:18] <+NKOrange> Na red head is Batman
[2:51:20] <Mogel56> Grandmaster hasn't shown up even in current story.
[2:51:23] <Psyramics> red hair is formerly of the knights, i think
[2:51:24] <+Mossinoda> all we know about the current grand master is that he is very big and strong man who left on a journey
[2:51:33] <+Jiggisnipe> Grandmaster is Varka, he's unseen in game so far
[2:51:36] <$teddygrahams82> the red head is pat
[2:51:47] <ShinBojangles> grandmaster likes to tell jokes
[2:51:48] <$teddygrahams82> tagnBLANKA
[2:51:52] <+roderick_legend> he is literally batman
[2:52:06] <Mogel56> Red hair is literally rich guy who fights crime at night.
[2:52:11] <drastic321> picard?
[2:52:15] <Hyphen_Sum> I think he gets a bit at the end of this quest
[2:52:28] <ShinBojangles> he gets a quest later
[2:52:30] <Mantisprayer> You'll get his quest
[2:52:32] <Mogel56> It's part of his quest you'll unlock soon.
[2:52:35] <+NickHatesSnow> You'll get his quest early on
[2:52:37] <+NKOrange> PFFT

[2:55:14] <TheButtravage> @PlagueOfGripes Even having them doesn't give you much character to work with.
[2:55:16] <Mogel56> It's hard to form attachments to characters when you have them too lol
[2:55:17] <+NickHatesSnow> I think there's like 2-3 characters I liked in this game honestly
[2:55:21] <GeltonZ> Yup
[2:55:23] <+NickHatesSnow> Yes
[2:55:25] <+Mossinoda> draw thicc abyss mage

[2:55:35] <DracaenaLeaf> There may be a chance to get a free Xinyan during the Chinese New Year-like Event in the next patch or two
[2:55:57] <+fizzguy47> Should be a missed translation
[2:56:01] <+Mossinoda> that's just script stuff that wasn't patched out
[2:56:06] <Mantisprayer> It's a fuck up. I don't think it happenes later

[2:56:24] <TheButtravage> @PlagueOfGripes Probably a translation error.  Pretty sure most promotional art use Aether as the canon choice, though the newer art is using the female more now.

[3:03:49] <TimetodiveLTX> plague i'm not seeing it
[3:03:50] <Erwin_Dedic> The thigh gap is there to distract you from the fact that she's probably the final boss.
[3:03:55] <+Mossinoda> in all seriousness, she's probably a piece of plywood under there
[3:03:57] <$teddygrahams82> paimon is a jellybean

[3:06:48] <bepbopdrn> He is threating us
[3:06:51] <GeltonZ> Maybe it's because Paimon is supposed to be a grown woman but tiny? *shrug*
[3:06:55] <EddieDalmunda> The homunculi is known for have its proportions at a cellular level.
[3:06:58] <SuperVaderMan> He has the power to create. And that's threatening enough

[3:09:06] <TheButtravage> @cosmicleviathan18 Pretty much.
[3:09:07] <Mantisprayer> Barbatos does nothing, not even his friends like him that much.
[3:09:11] <eristhanewood> I mean sounds like god behavior
[3:09:13] <ShinBojangles> our God is a deadbeat sugoiSadguts
[3:09:15] <+Mossinoda> ah, ffxiv let me in. Don't know when I'll resurface
[3:09:21] <Jmann1892> god of freedom from his job
[3:09:29] <+NickHatesSnow> The best part is because he left he became super weak
[3:09:29] <%NKOrange> man I love when God tanks the economy
[3:09:32] <+roderick_legend> not even the other gods like him, he is a drunk lol
[3:09:36] <Pyrrhus90> deadbeat god LUL
[3:09:53] <BreakerDS> The other gods actually do stuff
[3:09:54] <+Pantsugoii> um it's actually a lyre
[3:09:56] <%cosmicleviathan18> deadbeat femboi God LUL LUL LUL
[3:09:57] <@Nightbot> Plague is a youtube animator and also streams at https://picarto.tv/Plague . Also: t-shirts! http://goo.gl/lze8QO
[3:10:01] <ShinBojangles> he supposedly has the power to blow away mountains.
[3:10:02] <Mantisprayer> Venti is the exception
[3:10:03] <Artista_AF> how shit is your town that your god just leaves
[3:10:06] <$teddygrahams82> Irish symbol is a harbp
[3:10:12] <GeltonZ> Maybe the Gods don't know what they're supposed to do either!
[3:10:14] <$teddygrahams82> harp
[3:10:14] <+NickHatesSnow> you find out what they do as you go on
[3:10:15] <%NKOrange> Explicitly so
[3:10:19] <blerrger19> I mean, let's ignore all the cool stuff he does with his anemo magic but sure
[3:10:20] <BreakerDS> The answer is [spoilers] yes
[3:10:20] <TheButtravage> @PlagueOfGripes There are only three to interact with so far in the story.
[3:10:27] <pleochronic> liyue explains alot
[3:10:42] <+NickHatesSnow> Archon is basically this game's word for god
[3:10:45] <+Mossinoda> thankfully, the game gets further into that as you progress, dont worry
[3:10:48] <TheButtravage> @PlagueOfGripes Well, the third one is a dictator so is that an improvement?
[3:10:59] <%cosmicleviathan18> are we just going to share one beer?
[3:11:01] <Mogel56> God's are supposed to rule their lands but 2 out of the four introduced so far don't give a shit about their people.
[3:11:16] <%cosmicleviathan18> WE DIDN'T EVEN DRINK THE BEER
[3:11:18] <GeltonZ> And it all goes STRAIGHT to her hips!
[3:11:19] <$teddygrahams82> paimon ate it all
[3:11:19] <Samex_Comex> She ate the whole thing like a snake
[3:11:24] <TheButtravage> @Mogel56 Are they at 4, I'm only aware of three.
[3:11:32] <TimetodiveLTX> impressive
[3:11:37] <Mantisprayer> Amber can't cook for shit
[3:11:52] <drastic321> I cant cook for shit, but i sure can choose shit
[3:11:55] <$teddygrahams82> paimon napy is full
[3:12:02] <pleochronic> more than 4 if not counting archons and settling for the general term, 4 if archons
[3:12:11] <Mogel56> @Mogel56 Leader of the fatui gives them orders at least while not actually showing up yet.
[3:12:40] <$livlinn> grymTerry smol noise!!??
[3:12:43] <$teddygrahams82> that's why we don't talk to God because of that reason
[3:12:49] <TheButtravage> @Mogel56 I mean you can assume there are 7, I was just referring to the ones we are actually introduced to.
[3:12:59] <$teddygrahams82> oh no you sin
[3:13:01] <%NKOrange> just steal it tho
[3:13:07] <$teddygrahams82> God angry
[3:13:07] <Mantisprayer> LUL
[3:13:11] <%cosmicleviathan18> How about you stop dressing like a femboi and maybe people will take you more seriously
[3:13:11] <+Mossinoda> Well you do ask for the harp, they just dont give it to you. Then you steal it
[3:13:13] <BreakerDS> He's doesn't carry it cause he doesn't want to carry it, he's that lazy. He has a harp he can generate. lionheartKEKW
[3:13:35] <arkv01> plague the game is scripted in a way where if you ask too many questions the chinese stasi will find and recondition you
[3:14:02] <%cosmicleviathan18> that story kinda sucks
[3:14:10] <%jaypeesan> before doorbells were inveted locals pranked the dragon by farting at the cave entrance sending huge echoes down the lair
[3:14:17] <%jaypeesan> and he got fed up
[3:14:23] <Mogel56> Venti is the actual dumbest

[3:18:15] <$teddygrahams82> I liked dragons dogma and dragons Crown
[3:18:17] <Mantisprayer> She's basically Saber
[3:18:18] <+Tr1pkT12> She's classic overworked major
[3:18:22] <eristhanewood> I think you would really like klee
[3:18:23] <TheButtravage> But yeah, google searched your name and the game just to see if you ever played it on stream and found the unlisted stream.
[3:18:26] <blerrger19> You like the cut of her Jean? LUL

[3:23:51] <Hyphen_Sum> English is universal, duh
[3:23:53] <+NickHatesSnow> Everything is an isekai these days
[3:24:04] <ShinBojangles> no one ever bothers to ask who and what the traveler and paimon are.
[3:24:13] <eristhanewood> not a bad impression
[3:24:17] <%cosmicleviathan18> what  did you not hear what happened

[3:24:40] <$teddygrahams82> Whale!!!!
[3:24:56] <eristhanewood> She ordered me to call her master
[3:25:09] <ShinBojangles> jean and Barbara are half sisters btw
[3:25:29] <+roderick_legend> it is easy
[3:25:31] <$teddygrahams82> nono it's from kong pow
[3:25:32] <Hyphen_Sum> gotta be chosey
[3:25:35] <+transporterthesequel> spoilers, they are both right.
[3:25:37] <$teddygrahams82> brb
[3:25:38] <KainReave> Yea I did it for 8 months then it was a nightmare.
[3:25:42] <+NickHatesSnow> Everything you NEED is easy.
[3:25:43] <Mantisprayer> It's fine. You just have to know what you want and have restraint
[3:25:43] <%extradopeness> trust, my roommate has spent enough money on this shit for all of us
[3:25:52] <MountainBandits> if you get a dps character in your free rolls the game is playable
[3:25:52] <+transporterthesequel> f2p you pay with time, wallet you play with WALLET
[3:26:00] <tubit> everything is time gated so you have to log on and play every fucking day if you want to get anywhere
[3:26:03] <+Tr1pkT12> Now both of us won't be virgins
[3:26:12] <ShinBojangles> time to replace Barbara sugoiLain
[3:26:16] <%impulse255dj> At last my own clone... now give me those kidneys!!
[3:26:17] <TimetodiveLTX> the PCs being interdimentional royalty kind of reminds me of how zeno is supposed to be a stand in for the kids reading dragonball
[3:26:24] <%cosmicleviathan18> do you just pretend to be the other person then? plagueWut
[3:26:34] <+NickHatesSnow> You pretty much have a character for everything for F2P.
[3:26:52] <KatabolicRage> bitch they marched troops up on here in broad daylight, punched out a trap, and then left, Mondstadt just lets foreigners walk all over them i swear
[3:26:59] <+NickHatesSnow> But some overworld puzzles will be hard unless you do co-op or get other characters
[3:27:02] <ShinBojangles> this game loves to do that shit for some reason
[3:27:05] <Mantisprayer> Five fingered José NotLikeThis
[3:27:12] <TimetodiveLTX> i'll play this game when the private servers get running
[3:27:22] <TheButtravage> @PlagueOfGripes Yup, it was a common problem with the craft table in Mondstat since an NPC is right next to it.
[3:27:23] <KainReave> They kept doing that bs for 3 zones  too
[3:27:47] <MountainBandits> its bad when you try to get to a door  but an npc is in the way
[3:27:53] <Mantisprayer> Oh here comes the lore

[3:27:57] <eristhanewood> LUL
[3:28:00] <%cosmicleviathan18> ew nature

[3:28:14] <+KiwiRedgrave> why does plague hate the femboy bard?
[3:28:21] <$teddygrahams82> I also want to slap a God

[3:28:43] <%jaypeesan> enchanced crotch
[3:28:48] <+koboldfolseh> hahaha...
[3:28:52] <MountainBandits> thats the point
[3:29:03] <+Mossinoda> unfortunately all characters that are the "young boy" archetype have this model
[3:29:05] <%whimwhisp> That's the idea yes.
[3:29:06] <+koboldfolseh> I'm broken by so much anime that I knew to be a guy :V
[3:29:11] <Mantisprayer> KappaPride
[3:29:12] <blerrger19> B? That's generous
[3:29:16] <+roderick_legend> I already can see the next gripe art streams
[3:29:17] <%cosmicleviathan18> plagueHarkness plagueHarkness plagueHarkness
[3:29:22] <Mogel56> This is why the CCP is cracking down on femboys, it confuses.
[3:29:25] <arkv01> 👀
[3:29:28] <+polothegreatest> PogBones
[3:29:28] <+NickHatesSnow> Venti is still the most lewded character aside from Mona and Lisa I think
[3:29:31] <$teddygrahams82> hey I like b cups
[3:29:33] <%extradopeness> his hair wack his foot stance wack his hips... well hold on
[3:29:34] <ShinBojangles> its implied that venti can change his gender at will
[3:29:38] <Raldavar> Femboi can be anything you want them to be
[3:29:42] <%cosmicleviathan18> IT'S A TRAP!!!
[3:30:03] <TimetodiveLTX> dark madden runes
[3:30:06] <@Nightbot> Plague is a youtube animator and also streams at https://picarto.tv/Plague . Also: t-shirts! http://goo.gl/lze8QO
[3:30:09] <$teddygrahams82> pear breast are awsome
[3:30:14] <%JailShmixRemix> Venti 😋
[3:30:52] <+roderick_legend> the thing on his hip
[3:30:53] <EASrake> it the thing on his hip
[3:30:56] <%cosmicleviathan18> A wise man once told me "anything more than a handful, is a waste"
[3:30:58] <+NickHatesSnow> A rock that gives you magic
[3:30:59] <eristhanewood> Its that gem thing on his her hip
[3:31:04] <%NKOrange> the little gem thingy
[3:31:07] <MountainBandits> its the big jewel with the element icon on his belt
[3:31:09] <blerrger19> Vision is a gift from an Archon (god) that gives you magic
[3:31:14] <ShinBojangles> a vision is like a catalyst thats gifted to people by the gods in the sky.
[3:31:15] <MountainBandits> it grants avatar powers
[3:31:17] <Samex_Comex> Folk+yokai?
[3:31:19] <GeltonZ> It's what separates main characters from NPCs
[3:31:29] <blerrger19> Vision = magic, yes
[3:31:29] <Mogel56> Vision is the balls that give everyone the elemental powers. Supposedly the archon grant them to everyone individually.
[3:31:35] <TimetodiveLTX> like, lens?
[3:31:40] <eristhanewood> As you know Plague
[3:31:41] <Mantisprayer> They will to an extend
[3:31:42] <MountainBandits> they are about to
[3:31:43] <BreakerDS> They do though, the lore exists
[3:31:45] <+Mossinoda> they will alter
[3:31:47] <+Mossinoda> later
[3:31:47] <+NickHatesSnow> Yeah that's later in the story
[3:31:49] <blerrger19> @teddygrahams82 hell yea
[3:31:51] <+dante_must_die_exe> oh just don't worry about that stuff
[3:31:59] <+Jiggisnipe> lol
[3:32:04] <+koboldfolseh> they make it something a thing you learn more of
[3:32:06] <ShinBojangles> sugoiKanbaru
[3:32:18] <%extradopeness> gotta be some honkai nonsense
[3:32:23] <pleochronic> its meant to be obtuse, even the next god you meet is like "that's what humans use them for?"
[3:32:28] <+Mossinoda> that won't happen in this game
[3:32:30] <eristhanewood> LUL
[3:32:31] <Mantisprayer> In Other languajes the call Allogenes "Genshin"
[3:32:34] <KainReave> Later is...3 years later for the full explanation
[3:32:36] <eristhanewood> Yea duh
[3:32:42] <+koboldfolseh> yes, its a sucky explanation
[3:32:44] <eristhanewood> god,candidates
[3:32:46] <%impulse255dj> Venti is the sort of person who walks up to you at a party and says "I'm an empath.". And then you walk away from that person.
[3:32:51] <GeltonZ> Oh man I have peanut allogenes!
[3:32:56] <Mogel56> I don't even know what Celestia is.
[3:32:58] <ShinBojangles> they become like a champion or some shit.
[3:33:01] <MountainBandits> thats how venti became god
[3:33:11] <blerrger19> Most people who like thing will defend thing against all logic LUL even if its explained poorly they'll still make a point to tell you it made perfect sense all along
[3:33:12] <+koboldfolseh> "thank you paimon"
[3:33:14] <Maleicus> billy jeans
[3:33:20] <Mantisprayer> It's fake lmao
[3:33:22] <DracaenaLeaf> fake vision
[3:33:22] <$teddygrahams82> like pats hair line
[3:33:25] <+koboldfolseh> to fake it
[3:33:27] <BreakerDS> Literally the next line
[3:33:29] <TheButtravage> @PlagueOfGripes He wears a fake one to blend in.
[3:33:31] <ShinBojangles> his vision is actually fake
[3:33:33] <Banish55> Midi-chlorians?
[3:33:33] <%JailShmixRemix> its just cosmetic Kappa
[3:33:37] <%NKOrange> its so he people dont know hes a god
[3:33:53] <+koboldfolseh> lol we asked about it too
[3:34:08] <+5Two> Celestia? He's a Bronie!
[3:34:27] <Mantisprayer> It's a codename
[3:34:29] <+polothegreatest> Maam

[3:35:00] <BreakerDS> Not-Russia lionheartKEKW
[3:35:02] <+Jiggisnipe> LUL
[3:35:04] <CyberDingus> PixelBob Снежная, means ''Snowy'
[3:35:06] <President_Pariah> he's just making this shit up as he goes along isn't he
[3:35:07] <Mantisprayer> That's what it means
[3:35:11] <blerrger19> Welcome to Genshin were everyone talks in-lore and DOES NOT apologize for it
[3:35:12] <SuperVaderMan> Ah yes, the Dimbldorf of Dumpelsnarf
[3:35:15] <+kewlmyc> Fantasy Russia
[3:35:25] <%NKOrange> VA like "na man im good"
[3:35:25] <ShinBojangles> too hard to pronounce please understand jaboodyWonka
[3:35:26] <bepbopdrn> Sounds like spanish for "The mistress"
[3:35:31] <KainReave> They changed subtitles o.o
[3:35:39] <Mantisprayer> The Cryo Archon
[3:35:39] <%extradopeness> yeah no thats how i get watching this
[3:35:43] <Mogel56> The cryo archon is evil but the writing is bad.
[3:35:44] <$teddygrahams82> the legend of the dragoon
[3:35:45] <Jmann1892> She's the Ice Archon
[3:35:52] <ShinBojangles> shes a god like venti from the snow region.
[3:35:53] <Samex_Comex> Is she the ice queen from Narnia
[3:35:53] <Banish55> servanrt
[3:35:58] <+koboldfolseh> shes a god working under a bad person :V
[3:36:02] <MountainBandits> his energy core got stolen by an servant of the ice goddess
[3:36:02] <CyberDingus> PixelBob "Заполярный дворец" - Polar Palace
[3:36:04] <BreakerDS> Not La Signora
[3:36:08] <%JailShmixRemix> D: venti's cute though
[3:36:15] <Mantisprayer> not yet LUL
[3:36:23] <BreakerDS> La Signora is not the god
[3:36:29] <$teddygrahams82> "If I choose to create problems, I will" that's a powerful sentence
[3:36:32] <ShinBojangles> all the gods work under Celestia
[3:36:36] <SuperVaderMan> what if the bad guy's a super god
[3:36:44] <+koboldfolseh> can we do that now?
[3:36:48] <pleochronic> loosely gnostic mechanics
[3:36:49] <blerrger19> @BreakerDS This. Cryo Archon commands the Fatui
[3:36:59] <eristhanewood> yea the leader of the fatui is a member of the sheznyea rules at the zoopa loopa palace
[3:37:00] <Mogel56> Shit ain't written yet move on gamer.
[3:37:26] <drastic321> im a shit ruler:venti
[3:37:29] <+Jiggisnipe> he probably is
[3:37:36] <eristhanewood> give up
[3:37:37] <Mogel56> Stuff doesn't unlock there until after this, I mapped it all first too.
[3:37:40] <+NickHatesSnow> Honestly there's only one god in this game I like and it's not even one of the archons
[3:37:47] <DracaenaLeaf> the seven are Archons
[3:37:47] <MountainBandits> the chinese pronounce the L's differently
[3:37:54] <Mantisprayer> The Seven ARE Archons and they ARE Gods
[3:37:55] <DracaenaLeaf> gods became archons
[3:38:01] <$teddygrahams82> tagnBISON1 tagnBISON2
[3:38:15] <DracaenaLeaf> close :)
[3:38:18] <President_Pariah> can't Gods also be dumb kids?
[3:38:18] <HurtSquirt> its a chinese rpg, the word "god" is intentionally used loosely
[3:38:22] <%NKOrange> na hes a dumb wind sprit
[3:38:23] <Raldavar> Archons evolved from gods
[3:38:24] <$teddygrahams82> Jebasted
[3:38:28] <+NickHatesSnow> The 7 archons are the gods of the major cities, there are way more gods most killed by the 7 archons
[3:38:35] <+PlushMines> All the Archons are gods, not all gods are archons
[3:38:35] <HurtSquirt> one of those "but what IS a god BrainSlug " plots
[3:38:36] <BreakerDS> Gods -> Archons
[3:38:46] <+Mossinoda> No, that is not what's going on
[3:38:52] <MountainBandits> anyone with a vision can become a god after 1000 years or something
[3:38:53] <TheButtravage> Completely wrong.
[3:38:54] <guakomo> no godhood for blind people i guess
[3:38:58] <GeltonZ> EH-HE TE NANDAYO!!!
[3:39:03] <eristhanewood> eh he te nandayo!
[3:39:04] <blerrger19> No visions aren't what make you a god. Visions are lesser Gnosis, and those make you a god. Also Archon = god.
[3:39:06] <ahaegotrigger> lmao
[3:39:13] <$teddygrahams82> like the red stone from the legend of the dragoon
[3:39:14] <+NickHatesSnow> Nah Venti used to be crazy strong but he left mondstat and his laziness made people lose faith so he became the weakest one
[3:39:22] <drastic321> not a dymbtruck
[3:39:22] <ShinBojangles> paimon is gross
[3:39:26] <Mantisprayer> Kinda off the mark, Plague LUL
[3:39:28] <pleochronic> there are a few types of gods
[3:39:34] <ahaegotrigger> well Emergency Food I guess they wanted her to look like a snack
[3:39:40] <blerrger19> Also Liyue is fantasy China and he's mispronouncing everything cuz the VA doesn't speak 5 different languages, surprise
[3:39:47] <ahaegotrigger> LUL
[3:39:48] <HurtSquirt> ventis lore is almost fully explained although other gods arent
[3:39:53] <HurtSquirt> i forgot when though
[3:39:54] <MountainBandits> shut up venti
[3:39:57] <+kewlmyc> It’s a diaper, you can’t convince me otherwise
[3:40:00] <eristhanewood> the true sister was the friends we made along the way
[3:40:03] <+koboldfolseh> cant even get a drink
[3:40:30] <Mantisprayer> Fuck off Venti LUL
[3:40:36] <%extradopeness> is venti time like wario time
[3:40:41] <+koboldfolseh> hes a terrible bard
[3:40:42] <$teddygrahams82> odd things that turn me on are ghost and statues. what's wrong with me
[3:40:47] <%extradopeness> or mario time
[3:40:51] <$livlinn> Jebasted
[3:41:14] <+NickHatesSnow> yeup
[3:41:15] <TheButtravage> @PlagueOfGripes Also be aware that your player character is super special since you are the only one in this world that can utilize all the elements.
[3:41:19] <Mantisprayer> That's what he's saying
[3:41:26] <GZero_the_Hero> Don't believe Venti. I heard he is a bottom.
[3:41:42] <HurtSquirt> he must choose for himself to do exactly what we want
[3:41:43] <Mantisprayer> Albedo!
[3:41:44] <Mogel56> He's talking in circles to pad out the dialogue.
[3:41:48] <drastic321> an archon has trouble with a god?
[3:41:49] <Hyphen_Sum> android 18
[3:42:04] <%eldercat> plagueGripes
[3:42:05] <+NickHatesSnow> You do the razor questline?
[3:42:12] <Mantisprayer> Oh no
[3:42:13] <$teddygrahams82> cyborg?
[3:42:27] <TheButtravage> @PlagueOfGripes Actually let me correct that, your player charater and your sibling I assume.
[3:42:52] <$livlinn> Is this entitled fuck gets ANY character development?? kyoryuThunk
[3:42:53] <Mantisprayer> "Prince" another fuck up
[3:43:01] <drastic321> Prince?
[3:43:26] <HurtSquirt> got ur gnosis 👃
[3:43:29] <$teddygrahams82> hot
[3:43:43] <%extradopeness> venti your bars are weak and your feather sucks
[3:43:43] <arkv01> it was a legal and wholesome transaction :)
[3:43:59] <eristhanewood> its actually broken both ways
[3:44:03] <Mantisprayer> The Girl lines are fucked up too
[3:44:07] <+roderick_legend> is male character is the canon choise
[3:44:12] <blerrger19> Venti just said "Prince" when the subtitles read "Princess"
[3:44:14] <HurtSquirt> its the localization just being bad
[3:44:18] <eristhanewood> I picked the girl and got tons of princess lines
[3:44:33] <+NickHatesSnow> I like how she avoids suspicion from the Knights by attacking right next to their headquarters and in front of the church in broad daylight
[3:44:44] <+kewlmyc> It goes back and forth.  As the girl MC, sometime it assumes you’re the dude in dialogue
[3:45:04] <%NKOrange> Yup pretty much
[3:45:07] <Mogel56> They just let the nazis hang out 'cause reasons.
[3:45:08] <+NickHatesSnow> The girl is more popular tho
[3:45:10] <%eldercat> What's a Fatui?
[3:45:15] <Raldavar> "Country
[3:45:24] <blerrger19> The Fatui have infiltrated every nation in the game and every one of them pretends its not a problem even though its a standing invasion
[3:45:31] <+NickHatesSnow> Oh man you're gonna love Liyue
[3:45:42] <Andele1503> Its ancap swissland
[3:45:53] <MountainBandits> some one called this european afganistan and its pretty accurate
[3:45:53] <Mogel56> Harbingers are the unique characters that will actually get fleshed out lol
[3:45:53] <Raldavar> "One small town and a couple farms" = Country LUL
[3:45:54] <+kewlmyc> The Knights are incompetent as fuck.
[3:46:15] <SmickGG> I don’t trust the flying baby, gives me Bravely Default vibes
[3:46:24] <eristhanewood> I promise they wont
[3:46:31] <Andele1503> Most competent knight: some random medio girl
[3:46:36] <+dante_must_die_exe> not since testing it
[3:46:53] <drastic321> you gonna play elden ring plague?
[3:47:04] <+IHATREID> just popping in to say venti is a cutie
[3:47:10] <GeltonZ> Morgan Freeman: It was, in fact, a rant.
[3:47:16] <arkv01> this is like a bad 90s anime
[3:47:18] <Mantisprayer> Allogenes in othe languages are called "Genshin" btw
[3:47:20] <Hyphen_Sum> gotta ease em in
[3:47:41] <+koboldfolseh> I find it bad that the only knight I used of that group...is the one that FAILED to become a knight
[3:47:54] <+TopTieramisu> maybe it sounds better in chinese
[3:47:58] <Mogel56> big words
[3:48:01] <$teddygrahams82> I like Eli rants  cause I can't do it
[3:48:12] <MountainBandits> @Mantisprayer man the translation really sucks if thats true
[3:48:18] <drastic321> so are all archons one of the seven?
[3:48:26] <bepbopdrn> "I'm smart"
[3:48:29] <TheButtravage> @PlagueOfGripes Are you at all surprised that Asian anime writing is nonsense>?
[3:48:32] <arkv01> localizer probably tried to make things sound cool by obfuscation but
[3:48:33] <blerrger19> Let's not forget "La Signora is one of the Fatui Harbingers who are controlled by the Cryo Archon, the Tsaritsa of Snezhnaya"
[3:48:34] <+kewlmyc> It’s JRPG-ish as fuck
[3:48:37] <Mantisprayer> I mean, it is comprehensible
[3:48:38] <+koboldfolseh> you are the LEAST competent of them...so it cant be him
[3:48:47] <+lordericter> you get a boy or girl traveler and they just look like they look
[3:48:51] <eristhanewood> there are only i think 2 characters with alt costumes one of which is a rare 5 star
[3:48:58] <DracaenaLeaf> Main character rejected an outfit :(
[3:49:03] <ShinBojangles> have you seen venti's alternate outfit from the manga?
[3:49:14] <blerrger19> "Some Lady" Time god, probably Paimon's mom
[3:49:16] <%SilverRoddo> One made-up word, one phrase and one re-defined term is good.
[3:49:25] <+kewlmyc> We still don’t know who she was
[3:49:26] <MountainBandits> that lady in the beginning also is present in honkai impact
[3:49:31] <HurtSquirt> for no clear reason your character lets paimon talk 99% of the time, sometimes npcs wonder if youre disabled
[3:49:45] <TheButtravage> @PlagueOfGripes Your character does mention it as a God which is why you are exploring the Gods of the other nations while looking for your sibling.
[3:49:45] <Mogel56> Paimon is actually the main characters last braincell.

[3:52:04] <+koboldfolseh> new points unlocked
[3:52:07] <TimetodiveLTX> needs a ghost writer
[3:52:11] <Mogel56> You unlocked new artifact domains.
[3:52:15] <%NKOrange> artifact domains
[3:52:22] <MountainBandits> Welcome to the grindfest part of the game plague
[3:52:24] <Twoiis> Gear farming locations.
[3:52:33] <+kewlmyc> Where you farm equipment
[3:52:35] <+koboldfolseh> farming locations is all they be
[3:52:57] <KainReave> Well yes, but no. Grinding at AR40 like 8 times better than now
[3:53:03] <MountainBandits> you should discover them to have more teleport locations
[3:53:15] <Mantisprayer> It's comprehensible but you have to really sit down and take it in...
[3:53:23] <arkv01> camoplague
[3:53:43] <%cosmicleviathan18> wait is the opacity of the Gripes cut turned up? he's looking a little green bo8Bsmug
[3:53:49] <%cosmicleviathan18> cat
[3:53:53] <TheButtravage> Yes.
[3:54:02] <Mogel56> Wind blade is better held yeah
[3:54:31] <%NKOrange> the real end game is the player Vs the amount of resin you have at any given time
[3:54:32] <+koboldfolseh> "the grind"
[3:54:46] <$livlinn> Manufactured by Mitsubishi
[3:54:49] <rosemon5001> you also got item to upgrade your constelation
[3:54:50] <pleochronic> artifact domains are p bad till late game
[3:54:52] <TheButtravage> @PlagueOfGripes Look at the later level domains, that's mainly what they are used for.
[3:54:58] <Dreigun> at later levelss, it's for specific artifact sets
[3:54:59] <$teddygrahams82> I burnt my tongue on star snach
[3:55:02] <BreakerDS> They're not worth it until much later
[3:55:07] <Mogel56> I vote for Eula
[3:55:07] <DracaenaLeaf> eula
[3:55:07] <ShinBojangles> albedo banner
[3:55:10] <Hyphen_Sum> save them
[3:55:10] <+NickHatesSnow> event always event
[3:55:11] <+Jiggisnipe> Eula or Albedo Banner
[3:55:12] <+koboldfolseh> secret
[3:55:12] <Mantisprayer> character Banner never permanent
[3:55:13] <MountainBandits> eula
[3:55:13] <%NKOrange> Eula
[3:55:17] <grilledcheesee1> EULA
[3:55:18] <MountainBandits> ice girl thighs
[3:55:24] <+MisdirectionErection> Eula
[3:55:25] <Mantisprayer> Albedo or Eula is the same
[3:55:26] <$livlinn> Hatsune Miku color one
[3:55:26] <+NickHatesSnow> oh wait EULA is there?
[3:55:27] <$teddygrahams82> !coinflip
[3:55:28] <%SilverRoddo> Yeah, roll time
[3:55:29] <BreakerDS> Eula and Albedo share the pity
[3:55:34] <TheButtravage> @PlagueOfGripes What have you already spent on?
[3:55:34] <Mogel56> The pity carries over for both
[3:55:36] <DracaenaLeaf> but it has rosaria and noelle
[3:55:37] <+Jiggisnipe> Eula and Albedo share pity
[3:55:37] <arkv01> we could roll for rosaria Kreygasm
[3:55:40] <ShinBojangles> eula and albedo share rolls
[3:55:43] <Mantisprayer> They Share Pity
[3:55:47] <HurtSquirt> it shares between the special event characters
[3:55:47] <rosemon5001> rerun banners carry the same pity
[3:55:49] <%NKOrange> the pity does carry over for these two
[3:56:01] <TheButtravage> The two character banners do.
[3:56:01] <$teddygrahams82> !diceroll
[3:56:04] <Hyphen_Sum> pool is shared
[3:56:07] <+NickHatesSnow> You'll come to hate the gatcha system fast
[3:56:15] <%SilverRoddo> Reminds me of opening orbs in Strikeforce
[3:56:16] <arkv01> as it is with all gacha
[3:56:18] <+koboldfolseh> I stopped using it
[3:56:18] <KainReave> Only Albedo and Eula, 1st time this happened, 3rd banner is permanent and crap.
[3:56:19] <elweebdoctor> Yeah Eula!
[3:56:23] <arkv01> but this one is particularly stingy
[3:56:26] <ShinBojangles> to be fair albedo is more friendly to newer players but eula is more fun.
[3:56:28] <TheButtravage> @NickHatesSnow I don't think he'll play this game long enough to get to the worst of it.
[3:56:32] <+koboldfolseh> I have the team I want to use, its good enough :V
[3:56:32] <HurtSquirt> @NickHatesSnow he already hates it CarlSmile

[3:57:13] <MountainBandits> MORE SUPPORT CHARACTERS
[3:57:13] <kookaburragangwar> SUMMON SWORDS
[3:57:16] <Samex_Comex> What you get in your wonder ball
[3:57:17] <BreakerDS> Rule 1 of Genshin: Boys with shorts are strong characters
[3:57:17] <%theloganbrand> They know you're streaming
[3:57:18] <EASrake> its a water boy
[3:57:18] <+lordericter> well its the water trap
[3:57:18] <arkv01> sir we have to take you down to the police station for some questioning about little boys...
[3:57:18] <TheButtravage> @ShinBojangles Femboi
[3:57:21] <+koboldfolseh> the other FEMBOI
[3:57:21] <%JailShmixRemix> Worse femboy :(
[3:57:22] <Mantisprayer> He's very good
[3:57:22] <%cosmicleviathan18> IS THIS A TRAP?!
[3:57:22] <MountainBandits> NO DPS FOR YOU
[3:57:25] <Balcazaurus> yes
[3:57:25] <eristhanewood> its all twinks
[3:57:26] <ShinBojangles> LUL
[3:57:27] <$teddygrahams82> it's a boy?
[3:57:27] <rosemon5001> its a guy for the next story area
[3:57:32] <MESeele> An edict against femboys
[3:57:32] <Mogel56> He's second best support DPS
[3:57:32] <elweebdoctor> well..better than nothing
[3:57:32] <Balcazaurus> moar fembois
[3:57:36] <AsleepAura> Yeah they did
[3:57:39] <%NKOrange> yea the bois cant be too cute anymore
[3:57:42] <+lordericter> Yeah the Chinese government outlawed femboys
[3:57:43] <ShinBojangles> this game was made before that law was passed
[3:57:43] <DracaenaLeaf> Venti was included in a power point regarding that
[3:57:47] <President_Pariah> Xingqiu is voiced by Cristina Vee
[3:57:47] <TheButtravage> CCP cracking down on feminine men lol
[3:57:50] <arkv01> yeah its real
[3:57:51] <%extradopeness> twinks banned
[3:57:58] <kookaburragangwar> Every man is a femboy with 20 inch cock, to be masculine
[3:57:59] <ahaegotrigger> lmao
[3:58:01] <arkv01> but the CCP cares fuck all about the rest of the world
[3:58:02] <Hyphen_Sum> I firmly believe that law is for this game specifically
[3:58:08] <$livlinn> Yeh…
[3:58:09] <+koboldfolseh> thank goodness my Tom Boys are safe
[3:58:10] <TheButtravage> Don't you want to live in China guys?
[3:58:11] <AsleepAura> To be fair, Xingqiu was made before the law was put in lol
[3:58:11] <%JailShmixRemix> half of plague discord is not allowed in Chinese media
[3:58:12] <%cosmicleviathan18> to many femboiz ryboogFace
[3:58:12] <%SilverRoddo> When will they guest character, Shaoran Li?
[3:58:16] <%JailShmixRemix> Pain
[3:58:19] <ahaegotrigger> their birthrates are ultra low so theyre scrambling
[3:58:27] <DracaenaLeaf> Xiangling's sister Kappa
[3:58:33] <+KevinsLunchbox> man i love hearing Eli say femboy
[3:58:37] <$teddygrahams82> we need more green hair girls
[3:58:40] <%cosmicleviathan18> the legs are to straight to be a girl LUL
[3:58:43] <ahaegotrigger> true that does look like a lady LUL
[3:58:49] <ShinBojangles> he's a bookworm who writes poetry.
[3:58:49] <Artista_AF> Winnie the Pooh can't handle leaving the closet or else his Good Emperor points get taken KappaRoss
[3:58:50] <elweebdoctor> Dude looks like a lady
[3:58:51] <arkv01> LUL
[3:58:58] <AsleepAura> LUL LUL
[3:59:01] <Mogel56> He's really good, water boy that generates a lot of energy with a great ult.
[3:59:03] <ahaegotrigger> looks like he could handle a Polearm
[3:59:03] <GeltonZ> *NODS* Polearms are SO GOOD in this game.
[3:59:04] <+koboldfolseh> the nerd
[3:59:08] <ShinBojangles> you'll get a free polearm user soon
[3:59:08] <kookaburragangwar> Their tampon comes back brown
[3:59:09] <TheButtravage> Is Xiangling still free?
[3:59:09] <+Skianyan> isnt xiangling, like, free?
[3:59:10] <arkv01> isn't xiangling free?
[3:59:10] <+koboldfolseh> hes here for books and not doing work
[3:59:15] <$teddygrahams82> hulbert
[3:59:20] <$livlinn> NotLikeThis NotLikeThis NotLikeThis
[3:59:27] <Mantisprayer> Xhinchou... I think
[3:59:29] <TheButtravage> Yes, he's water
[3:59:29] <Mogel56> If you played on release they gave a free polearm girl
[3:59:31] <$teddygrahams82> helbert
[3:59:32] <pleochronic> you will be given one soon
[3:59:33] <DracaenaLeaf> abyss gives you a free polearm user, but that requires grinding
[3:59:35] <MountainBandits> he boosts damage
[3:59:36] <+koboldfolseh> poor fire guy who sets himself on fire too much
[3:59:37] <ShinBojangles> sugoiAwawa
[3:59:40] <+lordericter> lets get rid of benny for this new unit
[3:59:52] <TheButtravage> @lordericter You mean barbara.
[3:59:57] <MountainBandits> no benny is usefull
[3:59:59] <MountainBandits> ditch barb
[4:00:01] <+koboldfolseh> IGN: too much water
[4:00:02] <GeltonZ> Isn't Xiangling still free if you do some quests?
[4:00:08] <ShinBojangles> he's really good with bennet
[4:00:14] <rosemon5001> benny is good for anything unless you get him to c6
[4:00:15] <Mantisprayer> Replace Barb for water boy
[4:00:17] <KainReave> Xiangling was free at AR20
[4:00:21] <MountainBandits> @GeltonZ you need to get to abyss floor 4 to get her
[4:00:23] <Hyphen_Sum> nah
[4:00:24] <+drakthebest> Xingqiu is the best hydro character in the game
[4:00:26] <MountainBandits> yes
[4:00:31] <MountainBandits> its a bitch to level up
[4:00:31] <+Jiggisnipe> resources are limited for late game
[4:00:32] <DracaenaLeaf> focus on 4 you like for now
[4:00:32] <+drakthebest> You can put everything you want into him
[4:00:33] <arkv01> its not an issue before level 40
[4:00:33] <GeltonZ> @MountainBandits THAT'S it.
[4:00:35] <+koboldfolseh> yea you are better off saving for your set team
[4:00:37] <EASrake> there are rewards for leveling up characters at least
[4:00:38] <ShinBojangles> nah level up whoever you want
[4:00:40] <+Skianyan> its mostly 40+ when its an issue
[4:00:41] <Mantisprayer> Xinqiu is worth
[4:00:41] <KainReave> Femboi ultra worth it. It's barbara that's kidna crap
[4:00:45] <TheButtravage> @PlagueOfGripes I mean for really early on you kind of have limited resources but it's less an issue later.
[4:00:45] <HurtSquirt> it is exponentially slower around 30 or 40
[4:00:51] <+Jiggisnipe> but leveling to like 60 is fine
[4:00:55] <%cosmicleviathan18> oh no that voice
[4:00:56] <Mogel56> You can level up un-needed character late game because upgrading characters gives rolls.
[4:00:56] <GeltonZ> OH HEY! You got pretty rock throwing lady!
[4:00:59] <Samex_Comex> It's Marth
[4:01:09] <elweebdoctor> cute anime gurl
[4:01:11] <arkv01> his SWORD 👀
[4:01:12] <TheButtravage> Also, you got Ning she would be a good lead DPS.
[4:01:17] <%JailShmixRemix> Twink vergil?
[4:01:19] <biglomix> Woolie's character
[4:01:22] <Mogel56> Swords heal you when you take hits
[4:01:31] <Mantisprayer> Read the talents?
[4:01:33] <MountainBandits> apply wetness to the enemy
[4:01:39] <blerrger19> Arguably one of my least favorite character designs, but my favorite support
[4:01:52] <TheButtravage> She doesn't need much synergy, she's raw DPS.
[4:02:00] <+lordericter> oh she looks cool
[4:02:08] <Mantisprayer> Kaeya is good
[4:02:11] <Hyphen_Sum> switch traveler with kaeya?
[4:02:15] <%JailShmixRemix> never use amber
[4:02:16] <Mogel56> Ning, Benny, water boy and Noelle are a good team.
[4:02:17] <$teddygrahams82> yummy lisa
[4:02:17] <TheButtravage> Yeah, Lisa and Amber are unfortuantely bad.
[4:02:18] <EASrake> Yeah, I think Ning jsut beats the shit out of things with her book attacks
[4:02:21] <arkv01> amber will stay in the pokebox forever
[4:02:22] <+Skianyan> all of those are good, exept like, amber and traveler
[4:02:23] <grilledcheesee1> ues your credit card
[4:02:25] <blerrger19> Noelle good for shield, Barbara is more trouble than she's worth, Benett is best support hands down, I don't use Traveller personally...
[4:02:26] <DracaenaLeaf> Ningguang Xingqiu Bennett Noelle? idk
[4:02:26] <+NickHatesSnow> Mages are usually better on second constellation
[4:02:35] <blerrger19> But you've got a good party comp, just maybe pick a different main dps?
[4:02:38] <$teddygrahams82> ues your credit card
[4:02:39] <ShinBojangles> kaeya Bennet xinqiu for freeze
[4:02:40] <Mogel56> Having 2 geo buffs your damage when you have shield.
[4:02:51] <MountainBandits> switch traveler for ning, pray for better characters
[4:02:51] <Hyphen_Sum> Benny, Xinqiu, Kaeya, Barbara/Noelle?
[4:02:52] <$teddygrahams82> lol
[4:02:56] <TheButtravage> Ning DPS, Bennet buff and heal, Xinque for damage reduction and application, Noelle or main character Anemo.
[4:03:01] <DracaenaLeaf> Traveler is still my only anemo character after more than a year lol
[4:03:02] <pleochronic> build EM and it stays strong
[4:03:04] <+drakthebest> Bennett for heals/buffing, Xing Qiu sub dps, Traveler/ninnguang/kaeya main dps, and then you get a flex slot for your favorite
[4:03:07] <Mantisprayer> You can use Anemo Traveler but it's not great
[4:03:07] <+NickHatesSnow> Bennett, Barbara, Kaeya,  and Traveller is solid you can swap Bennet for Noelle
[4:03:08] <+lordericter> weird that they would make the mc a bad unit
[4:03:09] <EASrake> I never used Traveler because I got Sucrose out of my first 10 rolls. Very lucky
[4:03:13] <blerrger19> @TheButtravage I agree with @TheButtravage
[4:03:14] <KainReave> It's gonna be Benny, Water boi, free polearm char (from a bit later) and probably ice guy for a while
[4:03:15] <TheButtravage> @DracaenaLeaf That's really unlucky.
[4:03:22] <+NickHatesSnow> Barbara and Kaeya are good together
[4:03:25] <%cosmicleviathan18> no idea, just here for the Gripes LUL
[4:03:28] <+drakthebest> But if you're exploring the first two regions need you to pull out amber a lot just for pyro totems
[4:03:30] <+koboldfolseh> the main character can change elements anyway
[4:03:35] <ShinBojangles> ya kaeya is good with xingqiu
[4:03:39] <Mantisprayer> I like Geo Traveler more
[4:03:40] <Mogel56> Kaeya, Benny, water boy and traveler also make a good team.
[4:03:41] <TheButtravage> @NickHatesSnow Kaeya Xinque would be better.
[4:03:41] <DracaenaLeaf> @TheButtravage I just have yet t pull on a banner with an anemo rate-up outside of the very first one
[4:03:44] <arkv01> yeah freeze debuff is very strong against the bigger beef enemies
[4:03:52] <+NickHatesSnow> Do you wanna be hard to kill or kill things easily?
[4:03:58] <Mogel56> Kaeya and water boy's ults combo really well together.
[4:04:01] <pleochronic> he's good for off screen cryo, kaeya is v flexible for most comps
[4:04:07] <+drakthebest> Traveller is okay at the stuff he does
[4:04:09] <+koboldfolseh> yea
[4:04:12] <$teddygrahams82> why do the characters have Eva around them
[4:04:12] <ShinBojangles> this early in the game you can just experiment with whoever you want.
[4:04:13] <TheButtravage> @NickHatesSnow He really needs to kill things, he has not been using a DPS.
[4:04:20] <+koboldfolseh> 30 sorta when the GRIND starts
[4:04:21] <blerrger19> Remember how you eat books for exp? You get thousands of those. Just level everyone
[4:04:38] <+NickHatesSnow> @thebuttravage he doesn't have xinque
[4:04:43] <+NickHatesSnow> oh wait he does
[4:04:48] <TheButtravage> @NickHatesSnow He literally just pulled him.
[4:04:50] <TheButtravage> He's on screen.
[4:04:54] <+drakthebest> AR 30 is when it got grindy when the game launched, but with Inazuma it's probably closer to AR 35
[4:05:04] <Mantisprayer> Ninguang is a good dps
[4:05:06] <KainReave> She might be highest dps available but meh
[4:05:12] <TheButtravage> Ninguang is DPS.
[4:05:12] <DracaenaLeaf> Ning can be a decent dps
[4:05:13] <MountainBandits> ning is your highest damage option
[4:05:13] <Mogel56> Ning is DPS
[4:05:15] <BreakerDS> Noelle (maid girl) works well with Ningguang (tall rock woman)
[4:05:15] <rosemon5001> for me the fun at first was running around collecting shit  and for character leveling i liked female traveler soo much i havent switched her
[4:05:16] <arkv01> "DPS" is code for 5star
[4:05:16] <EASrake> Upgrade Ning's gear and she can do damage
[4:05:17] <HurtSquirt> ningguang is pretty good but kind of hard to get good gear
[4:05:18] <+drakthebest> Ninnguang is the best geo DPS
[4:05:19] <TheButtravage> Very good early game DPS.
[4:05:19] <ShinBojangles> ning is good but don't use her with wind traveler
[4:05:26] <Mantisprayer> Oh she's DPS
[4:05:28] <pleochronic> ning is a monstrous dps
[4:05:31] <TheButtravage> No, that's Noelle.
[4:05:33] <+drakthebest> She's also like, the only geo dps
[4:05:37] <TheButtravage> Noelle can heal and tank.
[4:05:41] <+NickHatesSnow> @thebuttravage I know self corrected, Barbara is still better tho cuz he needs a bit more before exp or constellations before he's worth anything
[4:05:41] <+VizierTempus> xinque + lisa can be good cheap electrocute dps. Noelle is best maid.
[4:05:41] <+drakthebest> So not a lot of competition
[4:05:42] <+JaydenC64> Ning is a good dps but requires some investment
[4:05:42] <DracaenaLeaf> Ning can be DPS and Burst-support. She can be a healer with  the prototype Amber
[4:05:44] <Mogel56> Ning can be built as support if your main DPS is Noelle.
[4:05:59] <Nazrelim> xinqiu is also very good
[4:05:59] <Hyphen_Sum> Benny and Xing for sure
[4:06:02] <+drakthebest> Ninnguang, xinqiu, Kaeya and Bennett would be really good
[4:06:03] <%cosmicleviathan18> POLL!!! bo8Bsmug
[4:06:03] <Mantisprayer> Bennett is stupid busted
[4:06:09] <ShinBojangles> benny and xingqiu are secret 5 stars
[4:06:11] <TheButtravage> @NickHatesSnow Fair, Barb doesn't need energy.
[4:06:13] <Goergorion> you can
[4:06:13] <MountainBandits> This is a good team right now
[4:06:14] <+NickHatesSnow> Barbara is a good early game option since healing isn't easy
[4:06:17] <+VizierTempus> Noelle can be DPS, yes
[4:06:17] <HurtSquirt> fire boy and water boy are both top tier supports
[4:06:17] <Hyphen_Sum> you can
[4:06:18] <DracaenaLeaf> Noelle C6 is an amazing DPS
[4:06:19] <pleochronic> noelle works well as good main dps
[4:06:21] <Mantisprayer> C6 Noelle
[4:06:23] <BreakerDS> Noelle can be built as DPS, very high investment though
[4:06:23] <rosemon5001> constelations make traveler super viable
[4:06:24] <MechaMithrak> Ning+Noelle+Bennet+Xinq would be decent and have good synergy
[4:06:25] <+Jiggisnipe> Noelle is primarily a dps
[4:06:25] <Jmann1892> Noelle is a great DPS/Healer
[4:06:25] <blerrger19> You can build Noelle dps
[4:06:30] <TheButtravage> @PlagueOfGripes You can do a DPS Noelle she just isn't the best.
[4:06:31] <+drakthebest> Noelle's ult converts her defense into attack so she can be DPS, but she's not the best at it.
[4:06:32] <Hyphen_Sum> she kinda just got buffed
[4:06:33] <MountainBandits> max constellation noelle is good
[4:06:39] <+drakthebest> Because she has terrible energy regen
[4:06:40] <blerrger19> Noelle gets a damage buff from her Def, its kinda stupid
[4:06:44] <+JaydenC64> Noelle unlocks dps potential at constellation 6
[4:06:49] <ShinBojangles> yes this team is good
[4:06:56] <Mogel56> Noelle with Def pumped makes her ult very strong and her best claymore is f2p
[4:07:00] <+NickHatesSnow> Barbara is the easiest way to heal early game, Noelle is the second best healer you got followed by Bennet then Xinque
[4:07:17] <ShinBojangles> rotate like xinqiu kaeya Bennet then ning
[4:07:26] <KainReave> No one needs those with Bennett.
[4:07:31] <+drakthebest> Xinqiu and Kaeya are just for ults and Es, they freeze stuff. Bennett's ult heals and buffs you. Ninnguang you attack twice and then charged attack on rotation
[4:07:32] <Mogel56> Shields are better if your team has 2 geo.
[4:07:38] <Hyphen_Sum> Fire > Water > Ice. Repeat
[4:07:40] <+NickHatesSnow> Don't bother using her until you get he constellation honestly
[4:07:44] <TheButtravage> No, NIng is your auto attacker.
[4:07:45] <MountainBandits> Keep you main dps to deal damage, switch to support characters to apply various buffs before switching back
[4:07:58] <Mantisprayer> Drop Bennett, XInqiu and Kaeya Burst when you have then ready then Go crazy with Ning
[4:08:04] <HurtSquirt> noelle is great after you accidentally get 6 of her while gambling for everything else for 3 months
[4:08:10] <+koboldfolseh> NERD
[4:08:15] <Mogel56> You want water boy and KAeya's ults active when attacking with Ning.
[4:08:17] <blerrger19> You understand rotation already. Pop shield, pop buff, then go ham with your dps
[4:08:18] <+NickHatesSnow> Rock mage is good with Noelle since she charges he energy fast.
[4:08:23] <KainReave> Bennett for fire, the water sword thing to vaporize it's high dmg from the previous fire, water burst/ult, then freezing with K, then spam rocks
[4:08:23] <pleochronic> it depends on how much ER they have, if low ER, use kaeya and bennett first to get xinqiu as much energy as possible
[4:08:23] <Samex_Comex> Oh my goodness
[4:08:28] <%cosmicleviathan18> same LUL
[4:08:31] <+drakthebest> With ninguang specifically, you hold your stick to move forward while attacking and it cancels some of her animations
[4:08:40] <MountainBandits> yes
[4:08:49] <blerrger19> With this party you'd want to start with Benett's ult, then switch to Xingqiu for his skill, then switch to Ningguang or Kaeya for dmg
[4:08:54] <TheButtravage> Correct, Ning you will generally auto attack and charge attack with.
[4:09:05] <Mantisprayer> It's not that hard to understand once you know
[4:09:10] <blerrger19> Ningguang's attack pattern is its own game LUL
[4:09:11] <ShinBojangles> use water and ice to freeze and then use fire to melt
[4:09:13] <Goergorion> one of the Dungeons has a reaction tutorial for each reaction
[4:09:17] <+drakthebest> The counters don't matter outside of very specific enemies with shields
[4:09:25] <+NickHatesSnow> wouldn't Lisa be better DPS since she's electro and Ning doesn't have her constellation?
[4:09:28] <DracaenaLeaf> right
[4:09:29] <Mantisprayer> Yep
[4:09:32] <+jiin6> for someone who played it a year... i don't get the element stuff either
[4:09:35] <TheButtravage> Yes, Geo generates shields.
[4:09:38] <EASrake> Geo pretty much reacts with everything and generates a shield
[4:09:40] <ShinBojangles> yes the last thing
[4:09:41] <+NickHatesSnow> Geo is good but not yet
[4:09:41] <MountainBandits> nobody really cares about what elements do, just make reactions to cause explosion to happen
[4:09:45] <Mantisprayer> Geo Unga bunga is strong on it's own
[4:09:45] <%cosmicleviathan18> plagueWut
[4:09:47] <+drakthebest> No vaporize is amazing
[4:09:48] <pleochronic> geo generally doesnt eat up other elements during its interactions
[4:09:49] <blerrger19> @PlagueOfGripes water and fire are supereffective both ways
[4:09:50] <TheButtravage> Vaporize is good.
[4:09:51] <BreakerDS> Vaporize is really good
[4:09:51] <+NickHatesSnow> Vaporize is great
[4:09:53] <Hyphen_Sum> Geo is primarily defensive
[4:09:53] <Mantisprayer> Vape is good
[4:09:54] <ShinBojangles> no vaporize is REALLY GOOD
[4:09:55] <TheButtravage> It's a raw damage multiplier.
[4:09:57] <@Nightbot> Plague is a youtube animator and also streams at https://picarto.tv/Plague . Also: t-shirts! http://goo.gl/lze8QO
[4:09:58] <AsleepAura> Vape is good
[4:10:00] <+drakthebest> That's literally the highest dps reaction in the game
[4:10:03] <KainReave> Ningg not gonna last, gonna get replaced with a 2nd fire (polearm free girl)
[4:10:05] <Mogel56> Vaporize is practically the meta lol
[4:10:07] <HurtSquirt> vaporize and melt are both super strong
[4:10:09] <TheButtravage> Vaporize and melt are the strongest multipliers.
[4:10:26] <TheButtravage> You are overcomplicating it.
[4:10:31] <pleochronic> vaporize is good for bossing because it boosts a single it
[4:10:32] <+drakthebest> Reverse vape (fire into water) and reverse melt (cryo into fire) are the best
[4:10:41] <+drakthebest> Those people are retarded
[4:10:44] <Mantisprayer> Outdated LUL
[4:10:45] <ShinBojangles> vaporize was ALWAYS good
[4:10:49] <+NickHatesSnow> For DPS Electro and Pyro types are usually the better options
[4:10:50] <Hyphen_Sum> Opposite
[4:10:52] <+Jiggisnipe> vaporize and melt are probably the best reactions cuz they are damage multipliers
[4:10:56] <Mogel56> Klee is the strongest character and her combo is vaporize.
[4:10:56] <%JailShmixRemix> outdated meta KEKW
[4:10:58] <DracaenaLeaf> Electro-Charged is said to be not good
[4:11:00] <MountainBandits> bruh
[4:11:01] <%cosmicleviathan18> plagueFear plagueFear plagueFear
[4:11:02] <EASrake> Overload and Superconduct were good when I played. It probably changed
[4:11:09] <AsleepAura> Superconduct is only good if you are using Eula or Physical damage
[4:11:10] <ShinBojangles> overload doesn't do any debuffs
[4:11:11] <+JaydenC64> Vaporize is good. Most electro interactions are weaker
[4:11:18] <+NickHatesSnow> What weapons you got?
[4:11:25] <KainReave> Overloard nerfed, superconduct only good if you have razor
[4:11:25] <+koboldfolseh> gotta meta
[4:11:33] <+koboldfolseh> its all about synergy
[4:11:35] <TheButtravage> @EASrake Electro reactions got buffed not long ago, but superconduct is mainly for physical builds.
[4:11:42] <MESeele> Got it. Genshin is menuing
[4:11:43] <+drakthebest> vaporize and melt are damage multipliers, freeze is CC and extra crit chance, and electro reactions are flat damage which makes them less desirable
[4:11:48] <Goergorion> simple tll you break out the spread sheets
[4:11:56] <ShinBojangles> water then ice then fire
[4:12:00] <KainReave> You would lead with water normally but bennett has shit dmg in this cast
[4:12:05] <Samex_Comex> When do we summon captain planet
[4:12:07] <Mogel56> You want water to always have his ult ready for an encounter.
[4:12:09] <Mantisprayer> Xinqiu's Burst applies a lot of Hydro
[4:12:11] <+drakthebest> Xinqiu generates more hydro than benett could ever hope to remove so it doesn't matter that much
[4:12:30] <BreakerDS> Genshin is combat is all about "do big number" by number crunching, reaction multipliers and min maxing stats
[4:12:31] <MountainBandits> dont worry about it
[4:12:35] <+Jiggisnipe> yea just do that
[4:12:39] <+NickHatesSnow> If you have a 3 star weapon called Debate Club the Noelle would be a great tank for early game since you can get it to max rank super fast
[4:12:41] <+JaydenC64> Certain characters apply varying degrees of their element
[4:12:42] <blerrger19> No fire first then water
[4:12:48] <ShinBojangles> at this point just play and learn it through trial and error
[4:12:50] <KainReave> They each have hidden nr's of how much element is left
[4:12:53] <Mantisprayer> Don't worry about it, it's a whole rabbit hole
[4:12:55] <+drakthebest> Xinqiu's ult lasts for a long time and creates a lot of hydro attacks, Kaeya's ult does the same but with cryo, you combine both to permanently freeze enemies  Then you use ninnguang to attack the frozen enemy
[4:12:57] <blerrger19> Water then fire is a weird reverse vaporize that only does 1.5x damage
[4:12:58] <Mogel56> KAeya and water boy charge their ults really quick you want to spam their ults and DPS with Ning.
[4:13:02] <%cosmicleviathan18> plagueTaps plagueTaps plagueTaps
[4:13:03] <fruit_pie_the_magician> Yeah Xingiu goes first because he'll be applying massive amounts of water constantly, even after anyone causes other reactions
[4:13:21] <Hyphen_Sum> Early game. Just unga bunga
[4:13:22] <fruit_pie_the_magician> So you'll be freezing and vaporizing whenever anybody else hits
[4:13:25] <TheButtravage> @PlagueOfGripes Do some experimenting, you could use Xinques skill into Kaeya's to freeze targets like how you were getting frozen ealier for example.
[4:13:27] <Mantisprayer> Bennet is healer and buffer
[4:13:35] <Mogel56> Ning can shatter frozen enemies which does big damage and can destroy shields.
[4:13:48] <%cosmicleviathan18> reject combos, embrace monkey
[4:13:48] <pleochronic> the systems are very flexible and best learned by throwing shit out
[4:13:50] <+NickHatesSnow> Barbara is better than Xinque at this point cuz I doubt Plauge has a lot of food on him to heal with
[4:13:52] <KainReave> You want to double dmg the water dmg from the water boi quick skill (that means it needs to already have fire on it from bennett)
[4:13:54] <TheButtravage> Yes, Ning will likely be on field more.
[4:13:57] <EASrake> @EASrake oh cool, I was running Childe and Fischl for my dps and it did seem just a little underwhelming at the time. Glad to hear it is slightly better :)
[4:14:24] <+NickHatesSnow> And Barbara does a lot of damage for a mage
[4:14:27] <+drakthebest> Different attacks apply different quantities of element, and different reactions consume different quantities of both elements as well, it's confusing and vague enough that you should look it up if you're interested in it
[4:14:32] <+koboldfolseh> thats the problem of genshin fo rme is later on you get someone that may do better and you already used up exp
[4:14:50] <KainReave> It's high dmg if it hits someone that has fire on them
[4:14:52] <TimetodiveLTX> grrrrugh
[4:14:56] <TheButtravage> I would reverse the order of Bennet and Xinque.
[4:14:56] <fruit_pie_the_magician> Ning just seems to work better than otherwise expected, it's like her cooldowns are super short or something
[4:14:58] <Mogel56> Their ults are more important than skills.
[4:15:11] <TheButtravage> Bennet R2 or ult first then Xinque.
[4:15:12] <Mantisprayer> Just tap bennett's E no need to charge it really
[4:15:26] <+jiin6> isekai book
[4:15:26] <+NickHatesSnow> Thrilling Tales of Dragon Slayers is great 3 star book
[4:15:36] <Mogel56> crit rate weapon is good
[4:15:49] <+JaydenC64> The crit rate one would be good for now
[4:15:50] <TheButtravage> @NickHatesSnow Not on a DPS, it's good on a support rotating to the DPS.
[4:15:51] <ShinBojangles> twin nephrite is good for ning
[4:15:59] <Mantisprayer> Twin nephrite is good enough for now
[4:16:00] <%cosmicleviathan18> when do we learn how to Dougie?
[4:16:01] <DracaenaLeaf> the green ying-yang weapon is decent for now
[4:16:07] <pleochronic> if you want to run anemo MC specifically lisa is a actually a very good support because electro reactions inflict electro with their aoe exempting 1, so the aoe reactions feed into themselves if you have pyro/hydro as an intermediary
[4:16:10] <EASrake> Twin Nephrite seems good
[4:16:17] <+NickHatesSnow> @thebuttravage Yeah my b he said ADC right after I said it
[4:16:20] <TheButtravage> Probably take the crit rate sub stat for now.
[4:16:35] <+NickHatesSnow> They were talking to me
[4:16:38] <TheButtravage> Master isn't good on Geo.
[4:16:39] <TheButtravage> Yes.
[4:16:44] <+JaydenC64> Yes
[4:16:45] <ShinBojangles> yes
[4:16:48] <+Jiggisnipe> yea
[4:16:51] <+NickHatesSnow> yes
[4:16:51] <KainReave> EM for GEO is crap (just makes 1000 hp shields be a bit higher.
[4:16:52] <%cosmicleviathan18> ztbHypers ztbHypers ztbHypers
[4:16:53] <TheButtravage> It's best you got for now.
[4:16:53] <Mantisprayer> Elemental mastery is not very useful for Geo characters
[4:16:55] <pleochronic> if no elemental mastery, go crit rate
[4:16:57] <Jaysky> Only problem I find with Ning is that her charge attack feels... Off? Like it has a weird delayed response. But that could just be on mouse.
[4:17:17] <Mantisprayer> It just boost Shield HP
[4:17:18] <blerrger19> @PlagueOfGripes if you wanna simplify the game look into "Transformative Reactions" and "Elemental Mastery"
[4:17:19] <pleochronic> only affects barrier strength
[4:17:19] <TheButtravage> EM only imprves the shields you generate from crystalize.
[4:17:24] <tanarath> It depends on the character & hidden experience-based knowledge that the game won't tell you.
[4:17:27] <fruit_pie_the_magician> Ninguang is a dps, almost nothing she can do matters when she's not on the field
[4:17:33] <+JaydenC64> Em doesn't boost geo damage
[4:17:34] <+NickHatesSnow> Geo isn't about dealing damage via elemental reaction
[4:17:49] <Hyphen_Sum> EM on Geo effects shield strength mostly so is used for defense
[4:18:04] <TheButtravage> Yeah, Ning won't be dealing her damage from reactions, she deals raw damage.
[4:18:05] <$teddygrahams82> this sh.t is why annoying this game
[4:18:12] <MountainBandits> plague to be honest, worrying about weapons isnt worth it
[4:18:18] <pleochronic> generally, low hit rate electro and anemo do best with em, the rest of the element archetypes want crit rate / dmg built
[4:18:27] <Mantisprayer> EM improves reactions
[4:18:37] <TheButtravage> @PlagueOfGripes Elemental Mastery improves all reactions, but her reaction is crystalize.
[4:18:37] <+Jiggisnipe> you got it
[4:18:37] <Hyphen_Sum> yes
[4:18:38] <EASrake> right
[4:18:38] <Mantisprayer> but Geo has none dmg dealing
[4:18:39] <fruit_pie_the_magician> If you want to be basically unkillable, maybe use noelle and ning for big shields, and xingqiu and kaya to freeze everyone
[4:18:51] <+NickHatesSnow> If you have a claymore called "Debate Club" then Noelle is a good option to pair with Ning since they get a shield bonus together
[4:18:56] <TheButtravage> @PlagueOfGripes Elemental Mastery is like the main damage dealing stat for Anemo.
[4:18:58] <KainReave> no dmg dealing with reactions*
[4:19:02] <+NickHatesSnow> I'm not
[4:19:13] <pleochronic> high modifiers
[4:19:17] <pleochronic> big hits
[4:19:20] <Hyphen_Sum> non-reactive damage for Ning is good
[4:19:20] <MountainBandits> she can deal the most damage in your party
[4:19:20] <+penguinlords> she has great burst damage potential
[4:19:20] <+Jiggisnipe> the geo elemental reactions have no dmg but geo characters can do dmg
[4:19:23] <TheButtravage> @PlagueOfGripes Because she deal high raw damage.  Stop thinking about reactions, think about character roles and how they fill them.
[4:19:27] <fruit_pie_the_magician> Because it's all she's good for, she deals damage, just not really with reactions
[4:19:28] <blerrger19> cuz her base damage and crits are really good
[4:19:31] <tanarath> Their elemental reactions don't, plague, not them in general
[4:19:35] <HurtSquirt> geo can have high base and scaling damage even if they have terrible combo
[4:19:35] <Mogel56> She'll be able to deal shatter with water boy and kaeya it's good early when you have nothing.
[4:19:36] <ShinBojangles> her base geo dmg is really good and she fills the downtime between cooldowns
[4:19:38] <Mantisprayer> She's very good at dealing Geo damage just doesn't have reactions that deal extra damage
[4:19:43] <+penguinlords> yes
[4:19:48] <Hyphen_Sum> yes
[4:19:50] <%NKOrange> yes
[4:19:50] <%cosmicleviathan18> bo8Riot bo8Riot bo8Riot
[4:19:51] <ShinBojangles> yes
[4:19:51] <MountainBandits> yes
[4:19:54] <+NickHatesSnow> Personally I think Noelle is a better option until Ning gets her first constellation
[4:20:04] <TheButtravage> @PlagueOfGripes Yes, as long as you are building her weapon and artifacts up.
[4:20:04] <blerrger19> Her damage is geo element but its really high damage
[4:20:09] <pleochronic> generally no, only vape and melt
[4:20:09] <ShinBojangles> no EM doesn't give crit
[4:20:09] <MountainBandits> @NickHatesSnow early game noelle is lack luster
[4:20:11] <blerrger19> EM does not get crit bonuses
[4:20:14] <arkv01> I think chat is thinking with gacha brain
[4:20:19] <Goergorion> auto att, build up her Heavy attk
[4:20:23] <arkv01> you need several copies of her to get good probs
[4:20:23] <TheButtravage> Of course they do lol
[4:20:25] <Mantisprayer> uh... no
[4:20:29] <TheButtravage> Most of your stats come from gear.
[4:20:30] <+koboldfolseh> Genshin: we need an excel sheet
[4:20:32] <blerrger19> Because Crit Damage is also pretty meta
[4:20:36] <tanarath> Weird 'balance'. Weapons matter A LOT
[4:20:37] <%JailShmixRemix> pretty
[4:20:38] <Mogel56> EM makes reactions stronger
[4:20:39] <KainReave> EM just makes vaporize and overload and melted attacks be higher. Individual attacks don't get higher if they don't trigger a reaction
[4:20:40] <+NickHatesSnow> @mountainbandits early game Noelle with a 5 star debate club can carry you far
[4:20:45] <Shiibbae> damn and i thought ffxiv melding was complicated
[4:20:59] <HurtSquirt> its not top tier, but its pretty good damage. EM combos is still meta for most characters
[4:21:03] <fruit_pie_the_magician> She's a hypercarry, so really you want to have everybody else just kind of raining passives while she works
[4:21:06] <TheButtravage> @PlagueOfGripes You get more character stats from artifacts and weapons.  Level ups don't give as much.  It's like the system in Dragon's Dogma.
[4:21:09] <Mantisprayer> 2 star weapons are fine to use up
[4:21:11] <KainReave> Probably not. Fuck 3* weapons.
[4:21:11] <+jiin6> there good in a pinch
[4:21:13] <pleochronic> that one specifically is fine cause crit stats are rare
[4:21:16] <ShinBojangles> you'll get alot more resources by just playing the game
[4:21:17] <+penguinlords> it's the best you got right now
[4:21:17] <KainReave> But up to lvl 40 like
[4:21:18] <EASrake> I think it will be a while before you get a good 4 star
[4:21:29] <MountainBandits> thats a good 3 star weapon
[4:21:35] <Dreigun> the investment is pretty negligible at this stage compared to what you have available later
[4:21:44] <tanarath> 3* stuff is fine to upgrade, it's usually good
[4:21:52] <MountainBandits> Dont even think about 5 star weapons
[4:21:54] <fruit_pie_the_magician> By the time you actually get anything good you'll have to use ridiculous amounts of stuff to level them
[4:22:00] <TheButtravage> @PlagueOfGripes If you get a better weapon you can feed your 3 star to it and upgraded resources will gain the used exp minus 10%.
[4:22:04] <Mantisprayer> You'll get more before you know it
[4:22:11] <ShinBojangles> you can always feed your 3 star weapons back into other future weapons.
[4:22:13] <+NickHatesSnow> 3* weapons are worth upgrading since 4 stars aren't common. It'll take a while until you got enough 4* stars for it to matter
[4:22:17] <+JaydenC64> Level a bit to get through early game
[4:22:17] <HurtSquirt> you can recycle them into the better weapons later
[4:22:23] <pleochronic> some 4 stars aren't as relevant for damage as 3 stars, namely the Favonius set
[4:22:29] <+NickHatesSnow> Yes
[4:22:31] <fruit_pie_the_magician> Prototype rancour is borderline the best 4 star weapon anyway
[4:22:32] <%NKOrange> yes
[4:22:34] <EASrake> yepp
[4:22:34] <MechaMithrak> yes
[4:22:37] <+jiin6> yes
[4:22:38] <MountainBandits> yes
[4:22:39] <TheButtravage> @PlagueOfGripes Yes. it's a 10% loss, that's it.
[4:22:41] <Mantisprayer> You can but less exp
[4:22:52] <%cosmicleviathan18> Now watch as everyone screams at you for upgrading a weapon LUL
[4:22:53] <ShinBojangles> yes not all of it but a majority of it.
[4:22:55] <$teddygrahams82> characters are like twitch emotes
[4:22:56] <KainReave> It's 10% for weps?
[4:23:00] <TheButtravage> Same thing applies to artifacts.
[4:23:02] <HurtSquirt> same for jewelery later
[4:23:10] <+JaydenC64> Yes
[4:23:14] <KainReave> Artifacts had -20% i think but they are different
[4:23:26] <MountainBandits> dont upgrade support weapons
[4:23:26] <blerrger19> @PlagueOfGripes a tip if you wanna ignore the many stats and weapons in the game "The damage from transformative reactions cannot crit and is only based on level, meaning ATK, Crit Rate and Crit Damage have no impact. However, the damage is affected by the target's elemental resistance." Also Elemental Mastery.
[4:23:38] <MountainBandits> your not gonna use them for auto attacks
[4:23:43] <%cosmicleviathan18> ew I hate how water boi looks ryboogFace
[4:23:57] <Goergorion> Fillet Blade is an option
[4:23:59] <+NickHatesSnow> the one with the blue handle I think works for him
[4:24:00] <%cosmicleviathan18> get some real pants
[4:24:07] <Samex_Comex> Bennie and the jets!
[4:24:11] <TheButtravage> @blerrger19 Reactions like melt and vaporize do crit but that's something to worry about later.
[4:24:23] <blerrger19> @blerrger19 Those are not "Transformative" reactions
[4:24:25] <Mantisprayer> Cool Steel or Skyrider would be good right now for Xinqiu. Optimally you want Sacrificial Sword a 4*
[4:24:37] <TheButtravage> @blerrger19 Ah my bad.
[4:24:39] <Hyphen_Sum> EM, ER
[4:24:44] <KainReave> Benny and this kid need a lot of energy regen (like 180%)
[4:24:52] <pleochronic> generally energy recharge and crit are good for him, em if run with electro
[4:25:03] <MountainBandits> no put energy recharge for him to get your burst up more
[4:25:03] <fruit_pie_the_magician> Water boy does virtually constant water procs, so ice and fire are good to have on the team with him
[4:25:09] <+JaydenC64> Energy recharge
[4:25:17] <Hyphen_Sum> @KainReave can you get 180 possible this early?
[4:25:17] <blerrger19> In other words, playing with "transformative reactions" means you only concern yourself with two stats: Level and Elemental Mastery
[4:25:19] <+NickHatesSnow> Noelle and Barb are your best healers rn
[4:25:31] <Mantisprayer> He wants his burst up as much as possible
[4:25:31] <KainReave> No, not this early.
[4:25:42] <+JaydenC64> You want his ult up as much as possible
[4:25:52] <ShinBojangles> cool steel is fine
[4:25:53] <pleochronic> character and weapon base stats will carry you surprisingly far
[4:26:01] <+NickHatesSnow> cold steel works
[4:26:10] <fruit_pie_the_magician> Kaya and Xingqiu are a REALLY good team, enemies with be frozen constantly
[4:26:16] <Briskp> merryBark
[4:26:19] <Mogel56> @PlagueOfGripes I tweeted a video of you that has an example of how this team would work.
[4:26:31] <+NickHatesSnow> You can fuse weapons of the same type 5 times to increase their effect
[4:26:36] <Mogel56> at
[4:26:38] <Mogel56> sorry lol
[4:26:41] <TheButtravage> I'd honestly say hit with Bennet first, than xinque, than Kaeya.
[4:26:47] <Mogel56> Your voice is in the background
[4:26:47] <KainReave> ^
[4:26:52] <pleochronic> just playing with them will give a good feel of cycling, cause you need to get used to cooldowns anyway
[4:26:58] <blerrger19> @blerrger19 Its fine, you wind up getting much bigger numbers with Vaporize and Melt (so-called "Amplifying" reactions) because there's more support for those, but you have to concern yourself with all kinds of stats and team comps and nonsense
[4:27:03] <Mantisprayer> If Xinqiu's burst is up the Hydro is almost guaranted to be applied
[4:27:08] <Hyphen_Sum> understandable
[4:27:35] <TheButtravage> @PlagueOfGripes Just got for attack percent main stat artifacts for early on.
[4:27:38] <EASrake> attack
[4:27:54] <Mantisprayer> Atack time/Geo goblet/CritDmg circlet would be optimal
[4:27:56] <KainReave> No one ever goes for defence (except Albedo)
[4:27:59] <fruit_pie_the_magician> Attack, crit rate, crit damage and geo damage are stats you want on her
[4:28:01] <tanarath> Attack kinda does if she's autoing, as does crit.
[4:28:01] <ShinBojangles> You want to give her attack and crit
[4:28:02] <pleochronic> attack and crit
[4:28:06] <TheButtravage> @Mantisprayer Way too early for that.
[4:28:09] <Owkono> at low levels flat stats are ok too
[4:28:10] <+PlushMines> Attack /crit /geo damage
[4:28:19] <TheButtravage> Just go for attack percent for now.
[4:28:41] <pleochronic> pure attack is best early game cause crit ratios are too low
[4:28:48] <TheButtravage> Put a focus on upgrading feathers first for damage output.
[4:28:57] <fruit_pie_the_magician> Building in Genshin kind of sucks until you manage to collect a decent stable of characters and weapons and artifacts
[4:29:37] <fruit_pie_the_magician> Because before that you have to farm sets for everyone, like I didn't get another fire character for months
[4:29:40] <Mantisprayer> You can sort by main stat
[4:29:57] <+penguinlords> crit dmg
[4:29:59] <TheButtravage> Yes, attack will be better for you early on.
[4:30:04] <@Nightbot> Plague is a youtube animator and also streams at https://picarto.tv/Plague . Also: t-shirts! http://goo.gl/lze8QO
[4:30:26] <+jiin6> crit rate and dmg are always a good option
[4:30:30] <TheButtravage> @PlagueOfGripes Flower artifacts are always HP main stat, and Feather artifacts are always flat attack.
[4:30:30] <fruit_pie_the_magician> I've literally done like every mission and now I just spend my resin every day to make runs to farm fire artifacts
[4:30:41] <Mantisprayer> Flowers and Feather are just Hp and Atck main stat yeah
[4:30:53] <tanarath> blue feather is best, generally
[4:30:58] <+NickHatesSnow> Crit rate is usually only worth it when you can get it to at least 30% imi
[4:31:00] <+penguinlords> try to get a berserker set flower and feather
[4:31:03] <pleochronic> if you can get 2 berserker 2 soujourner
[4:31:05] <resinite709> opening chest Kreygasm
[4:31:14] <tanarath> blue/black/red feathers
[4:31:15] <BreakerDS> Flower - HP/Feather - ATK
[4:31:59] <TheButtravage> Anything that heals you.
[4:32:09] <Mogel56> Any source of healing
[4:32:15] <TheButtravage> Right, shields just block damage.
[4:32:19] <Mogel56> Shield strength is seperate
[4:32:20] <+NickHatesSnow> Barbara, Bennet, Xinque, and Noelle can all heal
[4:32:20] <TheButtravage> Yes.
[4:32:44] <TheButtravage> You can honestly go for the 1000 HP 2 set bonus for some survivablity if you want.
[4:32:44] <Mantisprayer> Healing that you get from other sources. not very useful set bonus
[4:32:52] <HurtSquirt> good healers tend to keep you topped up or overhealed all the time anyway
[4:32:53] <TheButtravage> For this early on.
[4:32:55] <+penguinlords> martial artist would be really good
[4:33:05] <pleochronic> ohhh this is very important, for the shield strength stat: that only applies to the active character, and doesn't mean the shield is stronger itself
[4:33:22] <Mantisprayer> That one's good
[4:33:45] <Mogel56> Energy charge and hydro damage are best for him.
[4:33:46] <SikSuhz> id focus more on talents around this ar O.o
[4:33:48] <+NickHatesSnow> tbh most battles in this game can be solved by getting a heavy sword user and letting them swing an enemy into the water likeaa baseball made of iron
[4:34:02] <fruit_pie_the_magician> Honestly Xingqiu and Bennett are both basically S tier meta
[4:34:48] <TheButtravage> @PlagueOfGripes i would say go for energy recharge on bennet and HP.
[4:35:01] <SikSuhz> laeya hypeee
[4:35:07] <SikSuhz> kaeya : s
[4:35:21] <TheButtravage> Some characters are better at generating energy than others.
[4:35:22] <+NickHatesSnow> definitely recharge for Benny for the heals
[4:35:33] <SikSuhz> kaeya is pog best ice husbando
[4:35:37] <Mantisprayer> Kaeya is kinda underrated
[4:35:38] <+NickHatesSnow> Kaeya annoys me but he definitely isn't edgy
[4:35:57] <TheButtravage> Kaeya is a flirt, I wouldn't say edgy.
[4:35:58] <tubit> keya has good abilities, but his personality is meh
[4:36:07] <+jiin6> he's brother is the edgy one
[4:36:17] <scrubsintodreams> Personally I'm not a fan of Kaeya.
[4:36:20] <SikSuhz> keqingmains has like quick overview builds that show most optimal sub stats
[4:36:24] <tanarath> Does anyone have advice about this game? I left in frustration due to the grind & poor phone performance, but I was thinking of coming back.
[4:36:25] <ShinBojangles> they want ER and attack
[4:36:34] <TheButtravage> Kaeya you can go all attack for now or some recharge if you want.
[4:36:37] <fruit_pie_the_magician> He's good ice application, so using his stuff while waterboy's thing is active will freeze the piss out of everyone. So damage on him is less needed
[4:36:47] <Mogel56> For this team energy recharge works well for everyone but Ning.
[4:37:04] <+NickHatesSnow> @tanarath as someone who played it for months play a better game
[4:37:14] <pleochronic> yeah ER so everyone throws burst out then you switch to ning and throw rocks until their abilities end
[4:37:19] <fruit_pie_the_magician> And Ning's cooldowns seem really fast
[4:37:20] <Mantisprayer> Honestly, all your current party members just want to get their Bursts out as much as possible so ER will be helpful
[4:37:25] <TheButtravage> @tanarath Save yourself the headache.
[4:37:31] <tanarath> Thanks for the advice, I'll work towards ff14.
[4:37:33] <+jiin6> Builds are important
[4:37:35] <SikSuhz> i play on pc lol cant stand thinking this is a mobile game >.<
[4:37:57] <+NickHatesSnow> @tanarath That's what I did, no regerts
[4:37:59] <BreakerDS> At this point of the game, that's fine. Getting reactions and doing well on rotations is nice
[4:38:01] <scrubsintodreams> I used to play on mobile. Used to. :T
[4:38:08] <Flamethrowerman09> The controls on phone are what really turned me off to this game.
[4:38:14] <tanarath> @siksuhz it's brutal without a mouse or a controller & with lag, believe me.
[4:38:22] <+koboldfolseh> Benny knows
[4:38:30] <Hyphen_Sum> honestly just hearing about stat balancing feels somewhat similar to watching people adjust attache cases in RE
[4:38:33] <+jiin6> Benny a good boy
[4:38:38] <TheButtravage> @PlagueOfGripes Please change the language to Japanese or something, he's not as bad there.
[4:38:43] <+koboldfolseh> Benny just have a lot of bad luck
[4:38:45] <Flamethrowerman09> Unfortunately, he's one of the better characters.
[4:38:45] <+CapnBeefs> why do you have so many smol boi's?
[4:38:47] <SikSuhz> i feel this, i main hu tao and charge attack dash with lag is a nightmare ngl
[4:38:49] <DaiRyuseii> I blame benny's parents
[4:38:52] <Mogel56> @PlagueOfGripes I sent a second example video on twitter so I'm gonna call it a night for me. Goodnight Plague and chat.
[4:38:58] <chewyouthrough> Not Ba-
[4:39:00] <+NickHatesSnow> You got a new ability for Kaeya
[4:39:03] <+jiin6> All 12 of Benny's dads
[4:39:12] <Mantisprayer> You should read their talents to get a better understanding of their kit!
[4:39:12] <ShinBojangles> you gotta quest more
[4:39:17] <SikSuhz> do story quests, they give character xp books
[4:39:38] <TheButtravage> @PlagueOfGripes It's probably harder trying to explain it.
[4:39:40] <SikSuhz> at the end of a character quest u get 60 primo too
[4:39:43] <+jiin6> easy to learn, hard to master...bitch to grind
[4:39:44] <tanarath> It's not, but there's hidden shit that you have to research.
[4:39:47] <ShinBojangles> thats in the not-chine region
[4:39:49] <fruit_pie_the_magician> china flowers
[4:39:52] <@TheDropOutDragon> Well here I am.
[4:39:54] <@TheDropOutDragon> Looking at this.
[4:39:54] <TheButtravage> It's the battlepass.
[4:39:58] <+Bt_Robot> Find them around Liyue
[4:40:03] <tanarath> Battlepass
[4:40:04] <Samex_Comex> Look at it!
[4:40:16] <TheButtravage> Apparently you didn't.
[4:40:20] <%NKOrange> Free Barb
[4:40:25] <+jiin6> good
[4:40:26] <+lordericter> ohh, great
[4:40:26] <EASrake> wow you just had a free Barbara banging around?
[4:40:27] <Mantisprayer> Barbara Contellation let go! LUL
[4:40:28] <EASrake> still
[4:40:30] <+NickHatesSnow> I think the artficats are what eventually made me stop playing this game, really hard to make an optimal build with how absurd the droprates get
[4:40:32] <arkv01> now you have a barbara clone to do kinky stuff with
[4:40:34] <ShinBojangles> you got a Barbara constellation
[4:40:34] <CyberDingus> PixelBob Extra star!
[4:40:35] <TheButtravage> Yeah, get a constellation.
[4:40:36] <+Fru17Spr34d> Cheer500 Thanks Gripes for the animations and LPs. Keep being awesome.
[4:40:39] <@TheDropOutDragon> I'll try not to stage an intervention then.
[4:40:40] <chewyouthrough> That's what they all say.
[4:40:45] <tanarath> You get a free item to upgrade her.
[4:40:55] <+jiin6> Set it up, just in case dragon
[4:41:08] <tanarath> Don't roll on the gacha.
[4:41:10] <%theloganbrand> Aint that just a jam?
[4:41:15] <Mantisprayer> monkaS
[4:41:20] <KainReave> Did he buy the shop wishes? (If he even has the currency thingy)
[4:41:22] <Fru17Spr34d> Old 90's counter strike slang
[4:41:25] <@TheDropOutDragon> Well that sounds par for the course then.
[4:41:25] <+Bt_Robot> Max Barbara's  constellation as soon as you can! It gives a free revive every 5 minutes
[4:41:27] <tanarath> Not till you have stupid amounts of the currency.
[4:41:28] <TheButtravage> @PlagueOfGripes That's like, every game you play.
[4:41:40] <+MammothHam> It was for a new quest
[4:41:48] <KainReave> Barbara constellation also has the !
[4:41:51] <Samex_Comex> Hit him again
[4:41:59] <Mantisprayer> That just means you like it, Plague
[4:42:05] <ShinBojangles> standard banner rolls
[4:42:17] <KainReave> Constellations
[4:42:19] <TheButtravage> Yeah, the free pulls from first ascension are cheap so good to go for.
[4:42:26] <TheButtravage> There is no reason to save it.
[4:42:30] <KainReave> No point in saving any of them
[4:42:33] <Mantisprayer> Use it
[4:42:34] <%NKOrange> ye
[4:42:36] <TheButtravage> They are all unique to the character you get them for.
[4:42:38] <ShinBojangles> use the constellation upgrades always
[4:42:40] <+NickHatesSnow> constellations are all unique
[4:42:41] <TheButtravage> Nothing worth saving.
[4:42:42] <+Bt_Robot> Constellations are unique to each character
[4:42:45] <maskedmook> those are all character specific
[4:42:45] <KainReave> except...NEVER level Bennett to Const. 5
[4:42:49] <KainReave> 6*
[4:42:49] <fruit_pie_the_magician> None of them aren't unique
[4:42:51] <AnAnonymousGifter> An anonymous user is gifting 2 Tier 1 Subs to PlagueOfGripes's community! 
[4:42:52] <AnAnonymousGifter> An anonymous user gifted a Tier 1 sub to Owkono!  
[4:42:52] <AnAnonymousGifter> An anonymous user gifted a Tier 1 sub to TheAntiNihilist!  
[4:42:56] <tanarath> MC's is unique to him, each character's constellation is unique to them.
[4:42:59] <%Owkono> @AnAnonymousGifter Thanks for the gift sub!
[4:43:16] <TheButtravage> @PlagueOfGripes Nope, all constellations are character specific. So you just use em when you get them.
[4:43:26] <fruit_pie_the_magician> There are different items for geo and electro
[4:43:47] <%Huntercd> bitterShook plagueHarkness
[4:44:04] <tanarath> No?
[4:44:06] <KainReave> Oh yea, you get ones for Geo too (separately)
[4:44:14] <Fru17Spr34d> @fruit_pie_the_magician Methinks we need to have a chat.
[4:44:15] <SikSuhz> electro is the bad element
[4:44:18] <TheButtravage> @PlagueOfGripes Treat Traveller's elements as seperate characters I guess. each element gets their own constellations as well.
[4:44:26] <+jiin6> two gift subs...wait
[4:44:30] <pleochronic> despite geo and anemo having no reaction they go well together because of fall damage and slams btw
[4:44:32] <+Bt_Robot> There's even unique constellations per Traveller elements, they are story locked
[4:44:37] <Hyphen_Sum> Weirdly Anemo Traveler is lowest tier wise
[4:44:40] <@TheDropOutDragon> I'll be sleeping soon. But all this is sin. Hope you're having a good time regardless. But damn. See I can't decide how I want to end this statement on a happy or negative note. It's hard man. But have fun. FUCK.
[4:45:04] <TheButtravage> @TheDropOutDragon Is it because it's a Chinese gatcha game?
[4:45:04] <ShinBojangles> darknight hero quest sugoiGirugamesh
[4:45:24] <+NickHatesSnow> Did they ever redo the final geo traveler constellation so it doesn't make them worse?
[4:45:28] <%NKOrange> Wait you can access dragon spine this early ?
[4:45:33] <TheButtravage> Yeah, this was a poor decisions on my part.
[4:45:43] <+jiin6> whatever helps us sleep at night i suppose
[4:45:49] <tanarath> Don't, the cash-grab is real, but the GAME-game is great. Shame about how it's being used like this.
[4:45:50] <SikSuhz> dont see yourself playing say like a month later?
[4:45:51] <Samex_Comex> Huffman
[4:45:57] <+koboldfolseh> yes
[4:46:06] <$livlinn> You can’t pet the dog!!?? OhMyDog woolieOMG
[4:46:30] <%Void_The_Dark> Void_The_Dark subscribed with Prime. They've subscribed for 13 months! Good night Eli. Have a sub.
[4:46:39] <fruit_pie_the_magician> You with there was a hammer
[4:46:42] <fruit_pie_the_magician> wish
[4:46:42] <+jiin6> you have ning and benny
[4:46:44] <TheButtravage> Didn't you talk about how you liked the nothing quests?
[4:46:55] <ShinBojangles> @livlinn you can feed some of the dogs
[4:47:11] <tanarath> Give them to paige!
[4:47:12] <+Bt_Robot> Yes, ask your local Demigod to do your busywork
[4:47:31] <$livlinn> @shinbojangles Oh yay, just like BotW woolieDATTEBAYO
[4:47:34] <Mantisprayer> He wanted to do something else i think?
[4:47:35] <+NickHatesSnow> I came for that
[4:47:36] <chewyouthrough> It was really boring, yes.
[4:47:38] <%Owkono> number go up
[4:47:46] <GeltonZ> I watch you to hear you gripe.
[4:47:46] <ShinBojangles> pat who?
[4:47:51] <+jiin6> yes BIIIIG number good
[4:47:52] <Samex_Comex> Ew numbers
[4:47:54] <+NickHatesSnow> The numbers us litterally 95% of Genshin
[4:47:55] <SikSuhz> mmm yumbers
[4:47:55] <tanarath> We're dorks, it's ok.
[4:47:58] <fruit_pie_the_magician> That's like a good 60 percent of this game
[4:47:58] <$livlinn> LUL
[4:48:00] <%theloganbrand> I went and made a sandwich then
[4:48:08] <Fru17Spr34d> I came to ask about the chickens.
[4:48:12] <%NKOrange> number up make brain feel good what can i say
[4:48:12] <TheButtravage> @PlagueOfGripes I listened to you gripe before you understood any of it, and listened to you gripe as you were learning it, it's all good.
[4:48:25] <$livlinn> I was doing grocery shopping online, so it was fine
[4:48:29] <SikSuhz> the majority of games i play show number when u do thing
[4:48:31] <BreakerDS> Min/maxing, the game
[4:48:38] <elweebdoctor> and gacha
[4:48:49] <CyberDingus> PixelBob You must Math to Genshin
[4:48:50] <+NickHatesSnow> yeah
[4:48:56] <DracaenaLeaf> it's dumb
[4:48:57] <ShinBojangles> it paused it
[4:48:57] <TheButtravage> Oh God, yeah it can do that.
[4:48:57] <+Bt_Robot> Check your daily commissions
[4:49:02] <arkv01> yikes ScaredyCat
[4:49:08] <tanarath> Yeah, this system is dumb
[4:49:17] <tubit> it's very dumb. you can't abandon quests either. so you're locked in
[4:49:18] <+koboldfolseh> oh right
[4:49:22] <Hyphen_Sum> New artifact drop? Gotta rebalance my main for 12% extra damage
[4:49:22] <$livlinn> prenShake woolieMINHMAX
[4:49:26] <fruit_pie_the_magician> At least it tells you which character and which quest
[4:49:28] <+Bt_Robot> Sometimes story quests are blocked by those
[4:49:36] <Mantisprayer> You can press Up to see what quest?
[4:49:40] <+jiin6> ad applesauce to you too lady
[4:50:00] <tanarath> It has the diablo 2 problem
[4:50:01] <%Owkono> yeah I don't like that quest system
[4:50:02] <KainReave> 80% of the items are garbage
[4:50:07] <SikSuhz> you get a lot of maxed refine event weapons
[4:50:17] <SikSuhz> some really good f2p options too like the fishing mini game
[4:50:20] <tanarath> ignore 5*, those are gacha only?
[4:50:29] <+NickHatesSnow> Btw a good way to test a characters AOEs are to kill timmies pigeons and the river ducks
[4:50:30] <+xlxviciousxlx> what. just got off work. am happy to come home to Plague streaming
[4:50:34] <fruit_pie_the_magician> @PlagueOfGripes I've been playing this game for a year and I have a single five star weapon
[4:51:04] <TheButtravage> @PlagueOfGripes No, you were just slow, Xinque has a very long cooldown lol
[4:51:08] <ShinBojangles> COOL IT LUL
[4:51:15] <+xlxviciousxlx> so it seems I miss the Dark souls streams. lol
[4:51:37] <TheButtravage> Yeah, I think he finished Dark Souls.
[4:51:44] <Mantisprayer> Use burst more often
[4:51:59] <ShinBojangles> use your bursts
[4:52:04] <SikSuhz> use barb instead of ningguang and watch them all frozen forever?
[4:52:05] <+xlxviciousxlx> @thebuttravage i gladly rewatch his streams and videos many times
[4:52:24] <TheButtravage> @PlagueOfGripes Go to your feather artifact on Ninguange and feed it some other artifacts.
[4:52:30] <fruit_pie_the_magician> Also, normal attacks with ning creat charges up to three, and a charge move then fires all of them plus the charges
[4:52:55] <MountainBandits> the swords apply the wetness themselves
[4:53:09] <TheButtravage> @PlagueOfGripes Open with benny to put on fire, vaporise with Xinque, freeze with Kaeya.
[4:53:09] <Mantisprayer> Use his Burst with RB it's the best
[4:53:12] <Hyphen_Sum> kaeya then benny
[4:53:13] <SikSuhz> u apply cold after vape not freeze
[4:53:31] <+Bt_Robot> X to Kaeya is probably better, because you can freeze enemies
[4:53:36] <ShinBojangles> wtf is cold? lol
[4:53:40] <Hyphen_Sum> for reactions the order matters for damage
[4:53:41] <KainReave> The water splash thingy does 2x dmg if the enemy has fire
[4:53:49] <KainReave> that's the highest dmg thing
[4:54:15] <SikSuhz> vape is if you can nuke them, freeze if fight lasts too long
[4:54:17] <TheButtravage> You could do either one, I just think freezing them to set up Ning would be better.
[4:54:20] <Hyphen_Sum> Ice -> Fire does more damage than Fire -> Ice
[4:54:23] <+xlxviciousxlx> I will admit I love living to his DS1 videos at work when I have a chance to get me trough the day. l love the series that spawned the "Plague loses his humany playing dark souls compilation "
[4:54:28] <+jiin6> i noto understand
[4:54:33] <Hyphen_Sum> It's stupid but them's the rules
[4:54:36] <ShinBojangles> it's better to freeze so you can charge up Bennet skill
[4:54:36] <Mantisprayer> Fire melting Ice does 2x damage the other way around does 1.5x
[4:54:41] <+xlxviciousxlx> listening *
[4:55:03] <+NickHatesSnow> So I'm a bit confused chat, why Xinque over Barbara at this point even without constellations?
[4:55:07] <TheButtravage> Yeah, that'll happen.
[4:55:13] <Mantisprayer> Ning's burst is soo good
[4:55:36] <TheButtravage> @PlagueOfGripes For Ning's rotation you can open with her screen, then do three normals and finish with a charge attack or burst.
[4:55:36] <SikSuhz> xingq with kaeya is like best in slot
[4:56:01] <+Bt_Robot> If you haven't done it already, check out the domain that has the elemental challengeson Galesong hill, it's some of the best teaching the game does
[4:56:19] <Flamethrowerman09> Like dumbapples.
[4:56:24] <+xlxviciousxlx> Out of all the things that "TBFP" promoted. Plague became my favorite.  not that everyone else is bad.
[4:56:35] <%Huntercd> Why is Paimon a toddler?
[4:57:07] <tanarath> Paimon is an emergancy food source
[4:57:26] <Flamethrowerman09> Guy just walking through
[4:57:27] <%Huntercd> That looks like a toddler
[4:57:37] <Mantisprayer> You haven't used Xinqiu's burst yet LUL
[4:57:42] <+xlxviciousxlx> @plagueofgripes I'm actually wondering what ever came of the Star Trek commentary. There's a reddit post i believe, that someone compiled.  is there anything official.
[4:57:57] <+koboldfolseh> they arent
[4:57:59] <+koboldfolseh> they are in pain
[4:58:00] <ShinBojangles> you're missing out on alot of dmg by not using their bursts
[4:58:06] <+NickHatesSnow> They're boiling water using the slimes
[4:58:11] <TheButtravage> @PlagueOfGripes You can pop some bursts too since you are just wasting energy.  Benny, xinque, and kaeya all have persisting bursts when off field.
[4:58:12] <rusho> Because Hydro puts out their flame, so they're les dangerous.
[4:58:13] <+jiin6> they're being made into bombs which is suffering to them
[4:58:16] <BreakerDS> Hillichurls use them as a heating source/object
[4:58:20] <Hyphen_Sum> I think the implication is they use them to cook
[4:58:30] <SikSuhz> the burst is like the ultimate skill maybe hes saving it for endgame boss >.<
[4:58:41] <KainReave> RB skills
[4:58:47] <Mantisprayer> RB
[4:58:53] <TheButtravage> @PlagueOfGripes No, the ults.
[4:59:13] <ShinBojangles> dont save the bursts just use them
[4:59:16] <+NickHatesSnow> Hilichurls use fire slimes as stoves
[4:59:20] <Hyphen_Sum> Kaeya's is cheap I think
[4:59:25] <Mantisprayer> It get easier later, you should get used to it
[4:59:48] <TheButtravage> @PlagueOfGripes You'll get energy not just for using skills on enemies but you also get extra energy when enemies are at half health and when they die.
[4:59:54] <chewyouthrough> Maybe it's cause he's taller
[4:59:58] <rusho> Bursts have different uptimes dependent on a charas energy cap, and their energy recharge rate.
[4:59:59] <Flamethrowerman09> Kaeya is absurd in the overworld, but not for much else.
[5:00:03] <Mantisprayer> Kaeya has high multipliers on Normal attack I think
[5:00:32] <Hyphen_Sum> yeah real good physical hits
[5:00:37] <+NickHatesSnow> Noelle and claymore users are good at breaking enemy defenses and obstacles. you can one shot enemies if they're on a cliff or near water.
[5:00:49] <%xlxviciousxlx> @plagueofgripes  I always feel bad that I come onto streams that I can't interact with the game your playing. but I enjoy the content and you interacting with everyone
[5:01:05] <Mantisprayer> Press Up to see what quest
[5:01:54] <+jiin6> the death cube yeah
[5:01:55] <maskedmook> co op is kinda pointless except for bosses
[5:01:56] <+NickHatesSnow> you do razor's side quest?
[5:01:56] <Mantisprayer> CUBE
[5:02:01] <arkv01> lets go fuck some cubes
[5:02:06] <TheButtravage> @PlagueOfGripes Your co op is just gonna be doing stuff that costs resin and having people baby you while you find chests.
[5:02:11] <scrubsintodreams> I'd be down to fucking up Pat's Cube.
[5:02:13] <Hyphen_Sum> No
[5:02:16] <SikSuhz> world level
[5:02:19] <DracaenaLeaf> you can't join higher level worlds
[5:02:22] <+NickHatesSnow> world lv
[5:02:25] <blerrger19> I could clown on the cube sure
[5:02:39] <+Bt_Robot> You can only join levels close to your own
[5:02:53] <TheButtravage> @PlagueOfGripes You basically can't join world tiers higher than you, but you can join backwards.
[5:02:53] <Hyphen_Sum> Higher lvls can come down and melt people
[5:02:56] <BreakerDS> But anyone whos level is higher than yours can enter your world
[5:03:03] <TheButtravage> @PlagueOfGripes Add people to friends first then check the names.
[5:03:04] <pleochronic> whats his
[5:03:05] <ShinBojangles> I'm a good stranger :)
[5:03:21] <pleochronic> im curious to see if i can 1 hit your cube, if youd like that

[5:05:54] <+jiin6> thats AL...so alot of WL 8 and 9's
[5:05:58] <+Bt_Robot> Cheer500 If you haven't done it already, check out the domain Temple of the Wolf on Galesong Hill, it's some of the best education you can get in this game.
[5:06:02] <%barrakuta371> lvls 50 - 60 is a real hard grind
[5:06:25] <pleochronic> mb
[5:06:40] <%xlxviciousxlx> so whats this game about?
[5:06:44] <Hyphen_Sum> has 60+ even been established?

[5:08:32] <blerrger19> If you go to Co-Op Mode from the start menu you can automatically reject join requests @PlagueOfGripes
[5:08:39] <%barrakuta371> I wasted so much time lol
[5:08:40] <+jiin6> yep

[5:09:29] <scrubsintodreams> Wow.
[5:09:33] <maskedmook> there is almost no reason to use it
[5:09:38] <blerrger19> @PlagueOfGripes you could try inviting people instead?
[5:09:55] <MountainBandits> please understand, small 15 billion dollar business
[5:09:55] <@Nightbot> Plague is a youtube animator and also streams at https://picarto.tv/Plague . Also: t-shirts! http://goo.gl/lze8QO

[5:18:17] <+jiin6> its not there = quest not done
[5:18:21] <MountainBandits> no
[5:18:32] <+NickHatesSnow> Dragon is only 1 player
[5:18:36] <Bt_Robot> You can teleport directly to it
[5:18:57] <Hyphen_Sum> could be funny tho
[5:19:03] <+jiin6> not yet no
[5:19:09] <wrightlight94> not yet
[5:19:11] <+NickHatesSnow> The Wolf quest is solo but the fight isn't

[5:20:10] <%NKOrange> yea
[5:20:11] <+NickHatesSnow> Honestly one of the better early game quest cuz wolves
[5:20:11] <maskedmook> yep
[5:20:17] <+jiin6> now they're kids
[5:20:18] <SikSuhz> it unlocks a weekly boss
[5:20:39] <+Mossinoda> y'all need to chill LUL
[5:20:40] <Mantisprayer> LUL The kids
[5:20:42] <+jiin6> now you're baby sitting
[5:20:48] <tubit> child squad gooo
[5:21:03] <fruit_pie_the_magician> Diona is the only character in this game I actually kind of like
[5:21:03] <Hyphen_Sum> oceanid
[5:21:07] <pleochronic> is oceanid close to unlocked
[5:21:09] <+NickHatesSnow> All this kids are ridiculously powerful too
[5:21:09] <MountainBandits> fight the ice flower?
[5:21:09] <BreakerDS> ye
[5:21:10] <scrubsintodreams> I think you can, actually
[5:21:11] <%xlxviciousxlx> for sure calico. is the best
[5:21:13] <%NKOrange> you can do the ice flower
[5:21:16] <+jiin6> either fight cube again or ice plant
[5:21:17] <ShinBojangles> yeah you can redo the cube
[5:21:20] <arkv01> I don't think plague has touched china yet
[5:21:24] <Bt_Robot> The Ice flower will help level Kaeya
[5:21:27] <chewyouthrough> Oceanid man
[5:21:29] <DracaenaLeaf> Oceanid is a bitch, you'll love co-op with it
[5:21:34] <MountainBandits> Diona is best genshin bait
[5:21:34] <artoriasreapus> Apparently with my internet it’s going to take all night to download this. Still don’t even really know what it is but I’m getting to be incredibly bored
[5:21:37] <+NickHatesSnow> Oceaniad suuuuucks so yeah co-op might make it okay
[5:21:58] <+jiin6> Ocenaid is so boring of a fight
[5:22:00] <MountainBandits> wtf plague
[5:22:04] <MountainBandits> why did
[5:22:22] <+jiin6> cause exploring fun
[5:22:23] <+koboldfolseh> fast travel set up
[5:22:23] <+NickHatesSnow> Oceaniad is a fight that everyone hates
[5:22:27] <+koboldfolseh> "NUKED"
[5:22:39] <%NKOrange> yea only worth u opening
[5:22:43] <artoriasreapus> Nvm, it just went up to 30 hours, gonna die before it finishes
[5:22:45] <scrubsintodreams> It matters a liiittle to me. xD
[5:23:00] <SikSuhz> thats enough for 1 domain
[5:23:06] <Hyphen_Sum> dungeons are 20
[5:23:12] <+jiin6> for either domain... or one layline fight
[5:23:14] <+NickHatesSnow> nah people will ALWAYS have a need for this stuff
[5:23:21] <Mantisprayer> If you want to learn more about Elemental reactions you can go to the temple of the Lion and do some trials
[5:23:21] <BreakerDS> Domains or a leyline (yellow/blue circle)
[5:23:24] <scrubsintodreams> Unless you got fragile resin, or whatever.
[5:23:25] <Bt_Robot> Yes
[5:23:27] <+NickHatesSnow> that's a domain yeah
[5:23:28] <MountainBandits> you can still do the flower
[5:23:30] <%NKOrange> yea
[5:23:41] <fruit_pie_the_magician> i mean the hoarfrost cores would still be useful if they haven't maxxed the characters
[5:23:42] <+NickHatesSnow> artifact domains are the best ones for you imo
[5:23:50] <Bt_Robot> Domains are great ways to learn game mechanics
[5:23:50] <ShinBojangles> leyline is the blue and yellow markers, theres one to the left right there
[5:23:53] <+jiin6> that blue cloud for farming EXP
[5:23:57] <fruit_pie_the_magician> They're pretty fun
[5:24:05] <+NickHatesSnow> domains that reward artficats
[5:24:09] <Hyphen_Sum> can temple be done co op?
[5:24:11] <Bt_Robot> The glowey blue door
[5:24:14] <CyberDingus> PixelBob Someone please make Hu Tao silent
[5:24:19] <DracaenaLeaf> aloy
[5:24:21] <Mantisprayer> Aloy
[5:24:21] <%Owkono> Aloy
[5:24:21] <%NKOrange> Aloy
[5:24:33] <ShinBojangles> Thats only single player
[5:24:36] <+NickHatesSnow> Or Horizon Zero daen
[5:24:41] <maskedmook> this is soli
[5:24:44] <MountainBandits> english hu  tao is awful
[5:24:49] <Flamethrowerman09> The supposedly really big game that I've literally never heard anyone talk about.
[5:24:57] <ShinBojangles> Do a leyline, you can do that in coop
[5:25:00] <MountainBandits> FLOWER
[5:25:06] <+NickHatesSnow> may as well fight oceaniad so you don't suffer it soli
[5:25:11] <+NickHatesSnow> solo
[5:25:14] <Mantisprayer> I kinda like English Hu Tao too
[5:25:31] <MountainBandits> Nah the snow flower
[5:25:33] <%NKOrange> its in the liyue area
[5:25:36] <Bt_Robot> It's on the border with Liyue
[5:25:39] <Hyphen_Sum> he only has 27 resin tho
[5:25:42] <pleochronic> its some bullshit
[5:25:54] <+NickHatesSnow> the worst boss by far in the game
[5:25:58] <+Ether101_Prime> Have you gotten to the unnamed island yet?
[5:25:59] <+jiin6> the adventures notebook has info on it
[5:26:07] <Bt_Robot> 40 for a boss
[5:26:12] <+NickHatesSnow> which is saying something cuz some liyue bosses suuuuck
[5:26:15] <ShinBojangles> only thing you can do right now in coop is the XP leyline
[5:26:25] <fruit_pie_the_magician> You can still fight him
[5:26:29] <%Owkono> diamond with larger circle in the middle are domains for artifacts, skill books, or weapon mats
[5:26:43] <SikSuhz> ^
[5:26:49] <+NickHatesSnow> DO A KAEYA BRIDGE
[5:26:54] <Bt_Robot> South of Springvale is a Multiplayer domain
[5:27:08] <Hyphen_Sum> resin system sucks. I wish it would go away
[5:27:21] <SikSuhz> you can activate leylines but not claim chest for mob rewards
[5:27:21] <+NickHatesSnow> Chat knows what I mean
[5:27:22] <+Ether101_Prime> No there's a small island that you originally had to freeze you're way to get there off the starting cost.
[5:27:23] <Mantisprayer> LUL
[5:27:31] <ShinBojangles> dont look up kaeya bridge on urban dictionary NotLikeThis
[5:27:32] <Hyphen_Sum> do a dragon install
[5:27:34] <+jiin6> i have no idea what he's saying
[5:27:42] <maskedmook> it's a shit system tbh
[5:27:43] <%jaypeesan> breath of the wild vibes
[5:27:51] <Bt_Robot> Yeah, give those Bafmodads to Klee
[5:27:53] <%jaypeesan> and that glorious framerate
[5:27:58] <chewyouthrough> Use a DACTAR
[5:27:59] <+NickHatesSnow> Kaeya Bridge is the best thing about co-op. just turn into Kaeya near the ocean and everyone will follow along.
[5:28:11] <+Ether101_Prime> Yeah.
[5:28:27] <+Ether101_Prime> I'll come back to this someday.
[5:28:43] <tanarath> Plague, the best way to deal with the cubes is your fire archer.
[5:28:57] <tanarath> At least, from what I've found.
[5:29:11] <+Ether101_Prime> You can kick them.
[5:29:14] <Hyphen_Sum> Kick
[5:29:14] <SikSuhz> ^
[5:29:19] <%NKOrange> you can just go back to solo play
[5:29:22] <+NickHatesSnow> you can just leave co-op mode or says thanks
[5:29:22] <ShinBojangles> you can kick them from the coop tab in the menu
[5:29:26] <+jiin6> you can switch to single player
[5:29:34] <+Ether101_Prime> Bye.
[5:29:37] <Bt_Robot> If you bring up the radial, you can leave co-op
[5:29:52] <Mantisprayer> Cute
