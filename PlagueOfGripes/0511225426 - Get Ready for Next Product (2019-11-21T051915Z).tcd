[0:01:37] <coke_monster> As a Consoomer, Im very ready for next product.
[0:01:51] <+korth367> Here to cumsume product
[0:01:52] <%Rezca> La Poncho Villa
[0:01:53] <yoruichi12345> hello. More dumb jedi antics/
[0:02:19] <zaptar13> From my perspective the Jedi are evil
[0:02:28] <ScreamLord> Ugh, real life...
[0:03:00] <+DocIrving> Yay, time to consume more product!
[0:03:21] <ScreamLord> This map is Metroid Prime as fuck
[0:03:27] <yoruichi12345> Anakin wasn't wrong. Barriss's actions were wrong but her argument was right. Ahsoka got the hell out of there. And Luke Skywalker criticized the Jedi for their stupidity.
[0:03:55] <%Samex_Comex> Samex_Comex subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 7 months! Yahoo!
[0:04:01] <laserbeaming> I'm excited for new product. Can't wait to C O N S U M E
[0:04:04] <+DocIrving> Of all the things, Metro's watch and this game's droid have me thinking about UI design
[0:04:09] <coke_monster> Counterstrike racing LUL
[0:04:09] <zaptar13> What was that jump?
[0:04:15] <+squidking96> hello Plague
[0:04:32] <laserbeaming> Have the ropes being naughty?
[0:04:33] <yoruichi12345> Eh I don't watch Jim Sterling
[0:04:42] <+DocIrving> I mean, that is something that's gotta be tight in a platformer
[0:04:48] <ziggyjesus> Hello! How much of the stream did I miss?
[0:05:09] <+DocIrving> Well, not "tight" so much as "particular"
[0:05:24] <ziggyjesus> Wasn't Plague finished with Dathomere last stream? Looks like I missed a lot.
[0:05:28] <ScreamLord> The Jedi were extremely stupid and incompetent. 100% of their problems were preventable if they did literally anything except nothing
[0:05:37] <laserbeaming> Jim is a good reviewer/video game man, if you can emjoy his gimmick.
[0:06:00] <%Samex_Comex> Whoa look at that fat
[0:06:18] <zaptar13> Big lizard monkey
[0:06:23] <+DocIrving> Make 'im jiggle
[0:06:25] <laserbeaming> It's a troll! It will regenerate unless damaged by fire or acid!
[0:06:29] <%Faustgesicht> Faustgesicht subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 3 months! eh
[0:06:43] <yoruichi12345> @ScreamLord kind of why Dave Filoni directed episodes critisizing the Jedi ad Rian Johnson wrote that in for Luke in Ep. 8.
[0:06:47] <Tiny_Axolotl> Isn’t this game compared to sekiro?
[0:07:04] <Tiny_Axolotl> The parry mechanic.
[0:07:23] <+DocIrving> I will say, the effects on the cuts look amazing.
[0:07:31] <%Samex_Comex> Booble head
[0:07:38] <yoruichi12345> maybe it's not strong enough
[0:07:44] <ScreamLord> I love dumb shit like that
[0:07:54] <laserbeaming> Can you cut Storm Troopers in half? or is it only for non-humanoids?
[0:08:06] <zaptar13> Do you gain souls from defeating enemies?
[0:08:14] <ScreamLord> Dismemberment is limited to non-humanoids only
[0:08:22] <cerazor01> HHOOOOAAAHHH
[0:08:24] <laserbeaming> damn, that's boring
[0:08:36] <laserbeaming> Dismemberment is my favorite kind of violence
[0:08:47] <+DocIrving> ...You could have just done that with a skeleton in a freaking wall.
[0:08:56] <+DocIrving> That gets the same information accross
[0:09:00] <ziggyjesus> Imagine in dark souls the narrator started speaking everytime you picked up an item or interacted with a lever
[0:09:02] <yoruichi12345> is it like that one monster from Hoth?
[0:09:13] <shivra575> Hola Hi Hello Bonjur Yo other ways of saying the same thing over again
[0:10:03] <ScreamLord> Blindly bumbled your way toward progress. Like a hero
[0:10:36] <+DocIrving> "I bet sucking milk out of his tiddy ain't even good."
[0:10:37] <yoruichi12345> The only ram that is good is Nelliel in her release form
[0:10:43] <yoruichi12345> Best ram girl
[0:11:04] <ziggyjesus> Thrusts seem way more useful with lightsabers since one shallow thrust can seriously maim or kill
[0:11:53] <+DocIrving> *Dude gets his head cut off in front of him* "YEAH, MY TIME TO SHINE"
[0:12:00] <ScreamLord> Progress is for cowards
[0:12:24] <yoruichi12345> I like linear games since you can easily explore stuff while avoiding progression. that way you don't have to constantly backtrack
[0:12:42] <+fingalights> this one trick for progression. Gamers hate it
[0:13:24] <+DocIrving> ...I swear, he's gonna say that 30 more times, ain't he?
[0:13:28] <Jdrockefeller> Johnson was a fucker. leave his ass in the rock pile
[0:13:37] <ScreamLord> Well he is just an expendable clone in actually made of plastic armor
[0:13:38] <ziggyjesus> I like backtracking when it's a large new area that gets opened with a tool you get later. Not when you have to go through the same area for one box
[0:13:47] <shivra575> do it
[0:14:04] <Vital_Ire> Is stealth even a mechanic they tell you to try?
[0:14:13] <shivra575> see if you can get him to run off
[0:14:15] <ziggyjesus> I don't think so
[0:14:21] <Jdrockefeller> goat > Jedi
[0:14:21] <yoruichi12345> You can't
[0:14:23] <%Samex_Comex> It's those goats you hate
[0:14:38] <yoruichi12345> it's not Dark SOuls logic so you can't use gravity to defeat them
[0:14:52] <elementalwolf3> this looks H A R D
[0:15:04] <Vital_Ire> Yeah so it's actually probably not even yeah a mechanic, any perceived stealth is probably like unintentional
[0:15:12] <+DocIrving> But does Star Wars have YIFF DIZZ?
[0:15:13] <%Samex_Comex> Can animals use the force?
[0:15:19] <Vital_Ire> ye
[0:15:19] <+DocIrving> I don't think so!
[0:15:24] <Vital_Ire> There are animals that use the force
[0:15:43] <madogod> holy shit plague streams?
[0:15:54] <yoruichi12345> There was an animal in the Thrawn Trilogy that used the Force to create force bubbles. Thrawn used them to protect himself from Cboath
[0:16:09] <+DocIrving> Can they do it with bullets? Not even blaster rounds, just Bullet-Bullets
[0:16:11] <Vital_Ire> "force sensitive" creatures
[0:16:12] <+DocIrving> Made of lead.
[0:16:15] <ScreamLord> I wasn't joking when I said Storm Troopers wear plastic armor. Apparently their armor is made of some Star Wars bullshit material called "Plastoid"
[0:16:22] <Vital_Ire> there are entire pages on that stuff
[0:16:34] <+DocIrving> The alternative is wasteland 2-style goat screaming
[0:16:49] <Vital_Ire> I think they just killed an animal
[0:16:51] <madogod> plague gonna draw some furry version of them later
[0:17:32] <vaderxyz1970> No that rat knew some shit
[0:17:39] <%Samex_Comex> This guy is nuts!
[0:17:43] <Vital_Ire> I once was using a 100% cloak in oblivion while inside the actual hell relam of merunes dagon, and listned to two daedra lords have a casual conversation and sit on evil hell benches, but their only dialogue was screaming and insults.
[0:18:00] <ziggyjesus> Why are purge troopers so messed up?
[0:18:04] <zaptar13> He loves it
[0:18:42] <Tiny_Axolotl> Why does our hero have orange lightsaber?
[0:18:54] <ziggyjesus> You can customize them
[0:19:07] <ziggyjesus> Also Blue and Green aren't as cool as orange
[0:19:08] <SaltyDavid> Rocket man's fuse burnt out
[0:19:15] <spill_skill> is this John Jedi?
[0:19:19] <Vital_Ire> He has an orange to match his HAIR duh
[0:19:39] <CirclesForever> man this new pokemon game looks like a star wars rip off
[0:19:51] <+DocIrving> ...Is it weird that I'd respect the overall design there more if it had horrific goat screaming?
[0:19:53] <Vital_Ire> I miss jedi academy
[0:20:26] <+squidking96> hey plague you ever look at warhammer 40k and its lore? the game is fun but the lore gets super dumb
[0:20:37] <yoruichi12345> i thought that is what the twin lightsaber was for?
[0:20:48] <@Nightbot> Plague is a youtube animator and also streams at https://picarto.tv/Plague . Also: t-shirts! http://goo.gl/lze8QO
[0:21:08] <zaptar13> I think it wants you to abuse force powers more
[0:21:18] <SaltyDavid> Is the targeting dot supposed to match the color of your lightsaber?
[0:21:28] <Vital_Ire> if this was jedi academy you could just force choke him, and walk him over to a ledge and drop him.
[0:21:34] <Tiny_Axolotl> I like that black trooper.
[0:21:58] <SaltyDavid> He siad Traitor. Just like that guy that said Traitor
[0:22:04] <ziggyjesus> He's a block master
[0:22:13] <yoruichi12345> really is weird that these guys don't exist during the OT. hmm, i wonder why
[0:22:20] <BabbittDog> he never gives up
[0:22:24] <ziggyjesus> Force powers barely seem to work too
[0:22:30] <theamazingroberto> they're like DS2 1.0 heide knights
[0:22:40] <%Samex_Comex> Bah
[0:22:40] <Vital_Ire> how many force souls do you get for killing the goat
[0:22:59] <+DocIrving> Storytime?
[0:23:05] <ziggyjesus> At least you can parry heide knights, you can't even parry the stormtrooper
[0:23:16] <HiddenPorpoise> That's a real bazooka and that's messing with me
[0:23:22] <Tiny_Axolotl> Why can’t we just force choke him or toss him around with the force?
[0:23:25] <Vital_Ire> I think you're supposed to freeze the other trooper with your stasis move when you fight multiple ones
[0:23:26] <MrDante7> it also feels like the game doesn't like you using the tools it gives you unless it explicitly tells you in the narrative
[0:23:40] <zaptar13> I think you can force push him off a cliff
[0:23:41] <ziggyjesus> ^
[0:23:42] <VirtuaRailith> Palpatine should have bred a shit ton of those goats instead of clone troopers to destroy the jedi
[0:24:14] <Vital_Ire> Jedi academy lets you use 100% dark side powers and still choose to be good and get a good ending
[0:24:34] <MrDante7> like hey all these force powers that you can use, but the enemies that are strong enough to use them on counter them, and the other enemies are too easy to kill
[0:25:05] <zaptar13> What difficulty are you on?
[0:25:09] <Vital_Ire> I think the game wants you to stasis enemies like its dead space
[0:26:05] <yoruichi12345> I thought it was suppose to be "Tough but Fair"
[0:26:16] <MrDante7> but enemies don't have stamina is the thing, you have to play in their rythym, so all the combos and stuff you get don't really matter because it will never be as effective as just doing your basic combo
[0:28:02] <MattGetsGood> Stamina only applies to defending/blocking
[0:28:08] <kylecoolperson> Sekiro Star Wars?
[0:28:19] <zaptar13> You have to hold the button to charge it
[0:28:25] <MrDante7> its almost like that feels like force powers weren't thought through very well
[0:29:15] <HiddenPorpoise> Jedi are so in tune with nature that they just go around stabbing goats and orangutans
[0:29:24] <yoruichi12345> that's the problem with those trailers. It sold it as Star Wars: Uncharted game
[0:29:29] <%Samex_Comex> Why wont you stay dead fat thing!
[0:29:41] <ziggyjesus> That only stunned him for like half a second
[0:29:41] <+notalive_zombie> Its like those fat guys in DS2
[0:29:58] <MrDante7> the blocking feels a tad sluggish and has a long recovery too when you stop blocking
[0:30:05] <zaptar13> It's definitely stitched together from the parts of other games.
[0:30:20] <ziggyjesus> The fat ogres in DS2 could atleast be cheesed by circle-strafing and baiting the but slam
[0:30:30] <yoruichi12345> I liked Uncharted 2 and 4. Was disapointed with 3 and 1 was LOL levels of clunk
[0:30:46] <ziggyjesus> Uncharted 2 was the best in the series
[0:31:06] <LordPubious> But Nathan Drake is so loveable and not at all deplorable
[0:31:16] <MrDante7> if we don't make uncharted clones, we can't sell 10+ million units
[0:31:34] <yoruichi12345> Nathan Drake is kind of a thrill junkie though
[0:31:51] <+notalive_zombie> We need more Uncharted games!
[0:32:07] <+notalive_zombie> Triple A companies say so and I'm a sheep who agrees
[0:32:15] <MrDante7> its almost like the light side sucks
[0:32:20] <zaptar13> From what I could gather there's only about 4 force abilities.
[0:32:24] <coke_monster> I hope you can get Force Ghost and just kill the final boss by ghosting up to them and zapping them with lightning.
[0:32:28] <ziggyjesus> You only have 2 so far? I thought they would give you more this far in the game
[0:32:29] <yoruichi12345> I like how Japanese games even in Triple A don't care about Uncharted and will do whatever they want
[0:32:54] <ziggyjesus> Force Unleashed gave a bunch to play with
[0:32:57] <+chiluzza> you dont get anything fun just your standard powers
[0:32:57] <theloganbrand> This map is sorta giving me metroid prime vibes
[0:33:06] <+notalive_zombie> Thank you Japan for Sekiro!
[0:33:16] <rusho> Isn't Tarful the same name of that chief you rescue in Republic commando?
[0:33:22] <+silvery_cricket> Quick jump into the super heated gas
[0:33:23] <+squidking96> force speak with animals
[0:33:27] <%Samex_Comex> It's the thing from empire!
[0:33:39] <yoruichi12345> Jorus C;Boath could inject his will into the minds of others in Thrawn Trilogy
[0:34:11] <+chiluzza> thrawn trilogy was the best EU series
[0:34:21] <theloganbrand> What is this New york?
[0:34:28] <yoruichi12345> That's because Zahn was an actual writer @chiluzza
[0:34:44] <%Samex_Comex> Aw man
[0:34:59] <+notalive_zombie> How come everything I've seen thats organic isnt instantly killed by the light saber? Unless its a storm trooper.
[0:35:06] <yoruichi12345> sadly, we didn't get the trilogy as a movie seris because George HATED Mara Jade. he hated how she married Luke in the old EU
[0:35:08] <+andychockee> lova ya plague
[0:35:17] <ziggyjesus> Gameplay concession
[0:35:54] <+chiluzza> @yoruichi12345 that would have been a much better trilogy we did get a little bit of thrawn in rebels but man the plot armor was strong in that show
[0:36:38] <yoruichi12345> @chiluzza Rebels didn't know what it wanted to be. Clone Wars did, even if it didn't work out 40% of the time. Resistance knew what it wanted to be too
[0:36:57] <VirtuaRailith> I remember liking the Revenge of the Sith book better than the movie
[0:37:06] <theamazingroberto> filthy zeffos
[0:37:18] <zaptar13> Why is it they decided against splitting clones in half?
[0:37:21] <SaltyDavid> Why can't people that stop being Jedi still use the force but just as a regular jackass?
[0:37:31] <yoruichi12345> trying to get the list of force sensetive kids
[0:37:53] <%AzureSkyKnight> AzureSkyKnight subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 11 months! woohoo
[0:37:56] <MrDante7> you need to go on a fetch quest to get the holocron that has the list of names of everyone with force powers in the entire fucking galaxy
[0:38:06] <Fujiwara_92> backtracking
[0:38:15] <yoruichi12345> got to stretch out the gameplay SOMEHOW, right?
[0:38:17] <ziggyjesus> Imagine in infamous if every person who got powers had to arbitrarily align with a good or bad side
[0:38:28] <+chiluzza> i would love to see a jedi or force sensitive that doesnt use a lightsaber but instead uses a gun and uses the force to make him a better gunslinger
[0:38:36] <yoruichi12345> JRPGs don't seem to do that with chests
[0:38:42] <+chiluzza> like slowing down people so he can get better shots or propelling his bullets with force push
[0:38:43] <MrDante7> im fine sometimes with that kind of backtracking, but its really bad in this game because the traversal doesn't ever get faster or any good
[0:38:57] <zaptar13> @chiluzza Jedi Outcast has that.
[0:39:14] <SaltyDavid> Yeah backtracking is fine as long as the world is fun to move around in
[0:39:31] <Fujiwara_92> foot you say OpieOP
[0:39:58] <yoruichi12345> lol
[0:39:59] <SaltyDavid> These are some Dead Space Stasis puzzles
[0:40:02] <theamazingroberto> @chiluzza she didn't use guns but there is a jedi in EU named fay that was just so strong with the force she didn't carry a weapon at all
[0:40:30] <yoruichi12345> @theamazingroberto That sounds like what Yoda SHOULD HAVE BEEN IN THE PREQUELS
[0:40:33] <ziggyjesus> @SaltyDavid Dead Space Stasis Puzzles required more thinking
[0:40:52] <SaltyDavid> tru
[0:40:53] <@Nightbot> Plague is a youtube animator and also streams at https://picarto.tv/Plague . Also: t-shirts! http://goo.gl/lze8QO
[0:40:55] <%Rezca> Imperial training is top notch
[0:40:58] <Fujiwara_92> yeah cause that's normal
[0:40:59] <MrDante7> the prince of persia was here
[0:41:02] <Jrockoni> someone fucked shit up with a fork lift
[0:41:19] <artificiallynatural> LUL
[0:41:21] <yoruichi12345> come here you
[0:41:23] <ziggyjesus> MEANCING
[0:41:38] <SaltyDavid> This is in every video I see of the game lol. Just the guy that never approaches you
[0:41:40] <yoruichi12345> LUL
[0:41:47] <+kukadin> This is basically "Swing first"
[0:41:57] <+CommanderSqueaks> CommanderSqueaks subscribed at Tier 1. 
[0:42:25] <yoruichi12345> bye
[0:42:44] <SaltyDavid> He's still coming maybe
[0:42:54] <%PharmCat> PharmCat subscribed with Twitch Prime. 
[0:42:56] <yoruichi12345> that would be cool
[0:43:18] <%Samex_Comex> Alright a zipline
[0:43:34] <%CommanderSqueaks> Been enjoying your art snark for years, already a patron, wanted an excuse to throw more money at you.
[0:44:00] <Fujiwara_92> sometimes it isn't tho OpieOP
[0:44:34] <MrDante7> zeffo
[0:44:41] <yoruichi12345> How many things is Palpatine interested in?
[0:44:41] <theamazingroberto> ZEF OH
[0:44:42] <%Samex_Comex> They use it for 7 minutes in heaven
[0:45:15] <yoruichi12345> He's interested in the Zeffo, the Mortis stuff, the Unknown regions, ect
[0:45:39] <%Rezca> so majestic, so wow
[0:45:58] <zaptar13> They should have just made Metal Gear Rising Revengance with a Star Wars skin.
[0:46:06] <theloganbrand> I wish you could knock droids on thier sides
[0:46:26] <Jachibel> Good evening!
[0:46:32] <yoruichi12345> KOTOR got out of it
[0:46:42] <MrDante7> and now disney will not let you leave their wild ride
[0:46:49] <yoruichi12345> I don't think so
[0:47:09] <zaptar13> Nope he was behind literally everything
[0:47:10] <drefizz> ZINGO
[0:47:17] <MrDante7> trillions of soldiers out in space, waiting
[0:47:22] <Fujiwara_92> because OpieOP
[0:47:24] <coke_monster> SPACE GUNS
[0:47:43] <bear_breaker20> cause then theyd need to work on new designs
[0:47:46] <Jachibel> If it was in the shape of a flying gun they would never hit anything :^)
[0:47:54] <yoruichi12345> KOTOR 1 and 2 did it. I would also like them to reboot Thrawn Trilogy
[0:48:02] <%CommanderSqueaks> First person who says Sassafraz will get a thing from me.
[0:48:11] <theamazingroberto> and thank god it did
[0:48:17] <Jachibel> sassafraz
[0:48:19] <Jachibel> aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa
[0:48:24] <+squidking96> id love some star wars clone tactical shit
[0:48:35] <%CommanderSqueaks> CommanderSqueaks gifted a Tier 1 sub to Jachibel! This is their first Gift Sub in the channel! 
[0:48:38] <ziggyjesus> Idiots getting found out for being the frauds they are
[0:48:45] <MrDante7> disney ghosting people and losing their numbers
[0:48:48] <%Jachibel> @CommanderSqueaks AAAA thank you!
[0:48:53] <yoruichi12345> D&D got canned within the year. they didn't do it with Rian
[0:49:07] <yoruichi12345> Otherwise they would have done it within the year
[0:49:16] <ziggyjesus> Don't acknowledge they're being let go so the brand isn't damaged
[0:49:22] <%Jachibel> How else are stormtroopers supposed to get around
[0:49:30] <MrDante7> they did let go of colin trevorrow
[0:49:36] <theamazingroberto> hey remember that attenae on the bottom of cloud city? you guys like star wars?
[0:49:40] <%Samex_Comex> I have to run on walls to get to work
[0:49:41] <MrDante7> now jjabrams gets to make star wars 9
[0:49:46] <%CommanderSqueaks> @jachibel Thank you for humoring my dumb drunk ass.
[0:49:54] <%Jachibel> lmao, any time
[0:49:59] <MrDante7> rian johnson just had a movie come out
[0:50:05] <bear_breaker20> technically it will be called a 'film'
[0:50:08] <yoruichi12345> Rian will probably be used like how Geroge was in the OT. directing one movie and then moving them around
[0:50:37] <BioRockmanX> no.....
[0:50:38] <%Jachibel> What are your thoughts on what comes after RoS Plague?
[0:50:42] <BioRockmanX> dont do that....
[0:51:06] <%CommanderSqueaks> "NEVER BEFORE SEEN RESULTS" - Disney and also Yakuza 0
[0:51:20] <%Scarnehu> boomer disney telling it's old man. space wizard stories
[0:51:40] <BioRockmanX> They
[0:51:42] <yoruichi12345> Well it is still happening as far as I'm concerned given how Collon Treverow and D&D were shitcanned fast. Yet nothing confirming against it for 2 years with Rian
[0:51:44] <BioRockmanX> are firing
[0:51:47] <+silvery_cricket> If you tickle someones balls with the forcei sthat sexual assault
[0:52:17] <%CommanderSqueaks> @silvery_cricket Depends on what fan fiction you read.
[0:52:24] <%Scarnehu> never before seen gerth
[0:52:25] <%Jachibel> How did he even get up there
[0:52:39] <MrDante7> well treverow and d&d got the can after they made bad projects
[0:53:08] <MrDante7> and rian has a new movie about to come out, so he will probably get confirmed or tossed aside based on how that goes
[0:53:10] <%CommanderSqueaks> I am so used to seeing Plague in text form on Twitch, so weird hearing his actual voice on Twitch.
[0:53:10] <+silvery_cricket> How about a Star Wars ANIME
[0:53:16] <+silvery_cricket> ANIMEEEEEEE
[0:53:16] <%Jachibel> "The Wind" :^)
[0:53:20] <yoruichi12345> @MrDante7 exactly. that's why I don't go with assumptions. No confrimation means the RJ movies are still on
[0:53:30] <ziggyjesus> THE WIND IS PUSHING MEEE
[0:53:55] <%CommanderSqueaks> Also tepid take, but yes the zombie in the Re2 Remake jail cell was hot.
[0:53:55] <MrDante7> you are not allowed to hold on to those grates, only the specific grates
[0:54:01] <%Jachibel> Isn't force jumping like, basic force technique
[0:54:14] <+silvery_cricket> They dont have a yellow line of paint put on them
[0:54:19] <%Jachibel> lmao
[0:54:39] <theloganbrand> Ah to be a spry young country boy again
[0:54:39] <MrDante7> how does a jedi learn how to push, but still not be able to pull
[0:54:45] <%Jachibel> Dude compliments you
[0:54:47] <%Scarnehu> who would build a ventilation system like this?
[0:54:48] <%Jachibel> And ya kill em
[0:55:02] <%CommanderSqueaks> @theloganbrand Back when the fence was just a dream of a child.
[0:55:12] <+silvery_cricket> These men were abducted from their homes as children and made into slave soldiers, and you are just slaughtering them
[0:55:15] <Jrockoni> gotta appreciate a trooper who can give constructive criticism
[0:55:52] <+Lifes_A_Lich> starB
[0:55:57] <MrDante7> weird how jedi murder countless soldiers but never use less than lethal methods of defeating their enemies
[0:56:01] <zaptar13> Volunteers?
[0:56:03] <+silvery_cricket> You are slaughtering these minimum wage nazis
[0:56:18] <theamazingroberto> yokels who joined the army because they couldn't get into college on academic or sports - nothing at all like today
[0:56:24] <Jrockoni> there your classic lower middle class bored guys from shit hometowns. aka most soldiers.
[0:56:30] <MrDante7> the empire is basically a real military
[0:56:35] <bear_breaker20> stupid tax payers
[0:56:52] <%CommanderSqueaks> @mrdante7 "These aren't the droids you're looking for." Telling me Obi Wan couldn't have easily fucked that checkpoint if he wanted to?
[0:56:53] <+silvery_cricket> Dude imagine being this random asshole, and you are just kicking a jedis ass
[0:57:00] <%Jachibel> Have you tried like, talking to them instead of cutting them in half
[0:57:09] <Tiny_Axolotl> look at this badass commando trooper
[0:57:10] <zaptar13> The empire creates jobs.
[0:57:29] <%Jachibel> speaking of prince of persia
[0:57:30] <%CommanderSqueaks> @silvery_cricket "Congratulations, you are now an admiral"
[0:57:31] <MrDante7> @CommanderSqueaks if that was made now he would have
[0:57:59] <%Scarnehu> you might want a sip of space-estus
[0:57:59] <AnacondaVirtue> There's a rope you pull towards you once you learn Force Pull
[0:58:05] <+silvery_cricket> Like if you see Frank, and Frank is giving a jedi a real hard time. Frank being a normal guy of course give him a fucking pay raise
[0:58:39] <%CommanderSqueaks> @mrdante7 Cause JJ Abrams wouldn't know subtlety if it force tickled his balls. I don't even dislike his stuff, but god is it all blunt force trauma filmmaking.
[0:58:56] <Jrockoni> Luke actually wanted to join up with the empire till they burned his house down.
[0:59:10] <MrDante7> JJ went to the Kojima school of subtlety
[0:59:17] <+silvery_cricket> Wouldn't the game be more fun if you started with all these abilities
[0:59:23] <theamazingroberto> i mean they didn't burn his house down just his aunt and uncle
[0:59:38] <Tiny_Axolotl> @Jrockoni i thought that was sand people.
[0:59:38] <%CommanderSqueaks> @plagueofgripes Oh my god you have never been more right.
[0:59:46] <+silvery_cricket> His son is a terrible writer
[0:59:51] <%CommanderSqueaks> Can direct, cannot write.
[0:59:59] <%Jachibel> Name like... 5 bad JJ Abrams movies
[1:00:01] <%Jachibel> I'll wait
[1:00:02] <%Jachibel> :^)
[1:00:09] <%Scarnehu> "subtlety is for cowards"
[1:00:13] <%CommanderSqueaks> Has he made 5 movies?
[1:00:14] <+silvery_cricket> I read his son's Spiderman comic omg it reads like fan fiction edgy edgy fan ficition
[1:00:16] <yoruichi12345> Timothy Zahn and lawrence Kasdan would be the perfect duo of writers. that's what I would pick if I was doing a Thrawn Trilogy reboot
[1:00:17] <theamazingroberto> star trek... star trek into darkness...
[1:00:20] <HiddenPorpoise> Lost is 20 bad movies in a row
[1:00:21] <%Jachibel> oh no no no
[1:00:26] <MrDante7> star trek into darkness
[1:00:36] <Jrockoni> @tiny_axolotl nope. he thinks that for a second until obi wan explains sand people dont kill so organized.
[1:00:43] <%Jachibel> Wait was the third Star Trek bad? I haven't seen it
[1:00:43] <deligador> Looks like Oni.
[1:00:44] <MrDante7> @Jachibel all 5 movies he's directed
[1:00:46] <%CommanderSqueaks> Wait, I am still stuck on this, has JJ Abrams made more than 5 movies?
[1:00:59] <MrDante7> @CommanderSqueaks star wars 9 is his 6th lol
[1:01:06] <yoruichi12345> I only see TFA and TLJ as entertaining movies since Episode 1 and 2 ruined Star Wars for me
[1:01:26] <%CommanderSqueaks> Okay, so if we named 5 movies that'd be over 75 percent of his film making career
[1:01:30] <zaptar13> He's swimming there's nothing I can do
[1:01:34] <%Jachibel> :^)
[1:01:38] <theamazingroberto> according to IMDB jj has 69 producer credits 25 writer credits and 15 director credits
[1:01:43] <+silvery_cricket> If this was a movie in 1982 that would be a chubby guy in a suit
[1:01:58] <MrDante7> those credits aren't all film, he also directed on the shows he made
[1:02:03] <%CommanderSqueaks> "Does anyone know how to animate this monster swimming? NOBODY?! FUCK"
[1:02:08] <%Jachibel> Hey who are you calling horrid
[1:02:12] <yoruichi12345> @silvery_cricket I think it would be a stop motion creature
[1:02:13] <%Jachibel> Sometimes you can't pick your kids yknow
[1:02:14] <deligador> Mobs can't fall, you need to push it with force.
[1:02:20] <+Lifes_A_Lich> jermaRat rat is friend
[1:02:41] <rusho> humman XD
[1:02:41] <%CommanderSqueaks> He was so hungry for redhead asshole that he didn't even see the rats.
[1:02:44] <MrDante7> did it just die lmao
[1:02:45] <%Jachibel> Smoke break
[1:02:45] <deligador> Tired.
[1:02:45] <yoruichi12345> HOLY CRAP HE DIED
[1:02:47] <%Jachibel> dont worry about it
[1:02:51] <+silvery_cricket> He shit himself to death
[1:02:51] <+Lifes_A_Lich> betrayed by the rats D:
[1:02:54] <zaptar13> Rats defeated him
[1:03:01] <theamazingroberto> jj abrams *FILM* directing credits: star trek 2009, star trek into darkness, SW VIII force awakens
[1:03:03] <rusho> Rat used shun goku satsu on him
[1:03:06] <deligador> Sleepy boi.
[1:03:06] <%Rezca> Death to rat plague
[1:03:11] <%Scarnehu> rat game is strong\
[1:03:13] <%CommanderSqueaks> Sucking your own dick is dangerous, trust me.
[1:03:14] <eccentricprinceofroses> !uptime
[1:03:14] <@Nightbot> 1 hour 3 minutes 23 seconds
[1:03:15] <Jrockoni> rats barely survived, but they pulled it off!
[1:03:16] <%Jachibel> He was the big rat that made all of the rules
[1:03:16] <theamazingroberto> oh and mission impossible 3
[1:03:18] <%Jachibel> he had it coming
[1:03:21] <+silvery_cricket> He used Kaioken x5 and his body couldnt take it
[1:03:22] <MrDante7> @theamazingroberto and super 8
[1:03:24] <%Jachibel> Wait its dead???
[1:03:27] <%Jachibel> WHAT
[1:03:47] <theamazingroberto> @MrDante7 i feel like most people are, like myself, trying desperately to forget super 8 exists
[1:04:04] <%CommanderSqueaks> @jachibel His raging redhead jedi-focused erection was too powerful, caused his balls to explode.
[1:04:05] <MrDante7> well i went to the cast and crew screening so that'll always be a memory i can't get rid of
[1:04:16] <%Scarnehu> duh\
[1:04:21] <SuperVaderMan> He has like 20 tabs of pornography open, he's gotta go
[1:04:22] <AnacondaVirtue> Just like Grandpa Chewie in the Holiday Special
[1:04:26] <+silvery_cricket> You radio into Greez and you just hear the sound of slapping meat
[1:04:28] <%Jachibel> o lord
[1:04:30] <theamazingroberto> huff model glue until the memories are gone @MrDante7
[1:04:40] <MrDante7> i'm working on it
[1:04:41] <%CommanderSqueaks> Oh, I've seen that hentai.
[1:04:44] <%Jachibel> Do you think they have Twitter in the SW universe
[1:04:47] <%Jachibel> :^)
[1:04:54] <LordPubious> Bearded clam
[1:05:04] <+silvery_cricket> KILL THAT SPACE HORSE
[1:05:06] <zaptar13> Do they even have phones?
[1:05:07] <MrDante7> how fast do interstellar communications travel in star wars
[1:05:08] <MrDante7> and how
[1:05:14] <%CommanderSqueaks> @supervaderman Buy mors RAM so you can have more porn tabs open
[1:05:19] <AnacondaVirtue> Spoilers: You come back here for story reasons anyway. No real reason not to head to Kashyyk
[1:05:20] <%Jachibel> Of course they have phones.... Wait
[1:05:24] <%Jachibel> They have phones right?
[1:05:33] <MrDante7> they have hologram phones?
[1:05:35] <%Jachibel> I.. Can't remember a single time a phone or anything like it was used
[1:05:39] <+silvery_cricket> "They are watiching us B OW"
[1:05:47] <%Jachibel> It's always those handheld facetimers
[1:06:01] <Futurecity10> jesus christ, how'd plague get so far
[1:06:11] <theamazingroberto> i don't remember it ever being directly addressed as far as the tech but i know in other stuff like star trek communications travel through "subspace" or the equivalent
[1:06:32] <+silvery_cricket> They have to kill gingers its hard wired into their DNA
[1:06:48] <zaptar13> So space hippopotamus
[1:06:48] <%Samex_Comex> I would headbutt you if I saw you
[1:06:50] <%Jachibel> lmao
[1:06:52] <+Shoosler> nailed it
[1:06:52] <yoruichi12345> LOL
[1:06:56] <%CommanderSqueaks> @silvery_cricket As nature intended. Kill them all, Peter.
[1:06:58] <Jrockoni> BODIED
[1:07:19] <%Jachibel> imagine some ginger with a lightsaber walked into your house and murders your husband
[1:07:21] <+silvery_cricket> Years of Jedi training only to get your shit stomped by a goat
[1:07:24] <%Jachibel> then calls you a dumb fucking goat
[1:07:50] <%CommanderSqueaks> @jachibel Is flirting with the Jedi out of the question at this point?
[1:08:03] <%Jachibel> No, roll for charisma check
[1:08:12] <%CommanderSqueaks> !roll1d20
[1:08:21] <%CommanderSqueaks> Dammit Plague, no dice roll bot?
[1:08:28] <MrDante7> CommanderSqueaks rolls a 3
[1:08:31] <%Scarnehu> just like us\
[1:08:45] <%Jachibel> ... It's a 3. You try to seduce him by grabbing his rod and instead activate his lightsaber into your face
[1:08:47] <+silvery_cricket> Be funny if there was horrible snakes into the water
[1:08:47] <%CommanderSqueaks> Actually going to roll on my app for reals
[1:08:50] <%CommanderSqueaks> Wait
[1:09:21] <%Scarnehu> welcome in omekron
[1:09:23] <%CommanderSqueaks> Fuck me, it actually rolled a 3
[1:09:29] <MrDante7> i told you
[1:09:31] <theamazingroberto> XD
[1:09:40] <+silvery_cricket> The force is a mysterious power alright
[1:09:51] <%Jachibel> Plague hes a nice one
[1:09:52] <%Jachibel> nooooooooo
[1:09:52] <MrDante7> im like liam neeson in the phantom menace
[1:09:54] <%CommanderSqueaks> Can I use the fuzzy handcuff modifier bonus?
[1:10:03] <Jrockoni> you could have just let him be
[1:10:24] <zaptar13> Why could you climb that ledge from the water but not the other?
[1:10:26] <%Jachibel> Do you think Stims are addictive
[1:10:32] <%Jachibel> Or he'll develop stim withdrawls
[1:10:34] <MrDante7> yes
[1:10:47] <zaptar13> Maybe opioids?
[1:11:03] <+silvery_cricket> Alot of clothes in your size littered everywhere
[1:11:16] <MrDante7> you comeback later
[1:11:23] <%Jachibel> "S-Stim me" he says, 30 years from now in a dark back-room of Tatooine. But no one is there
[1:11:26] <+silvery_cricket> I cant wait until you fight someone like Palpatine or some crap
[1:11:33] <+silvery_cricket> and there is just a box with a Poncho right there
[1:11:35] <Quiet__Viking> wait are they in universe called ponchos?
[1:11:56] <MrDante7> well, do you want to know if you go underwater or not
[1:11:59] <zaptar13> I have bad news. There are undwater segments
[1:12:00] <%Jachibel> Yeah, they're from Space-Mexico
[1:12:32] <%Jachibel> Not acting very Jedi-like mr plague
[1:12:32] <+silvery_cricket> designed to aim for the balls
[1:12:32] <Quiet__Viking> sweet
[1:12:36] <%Jachibel> something something path to the darkside
[1:12:42] <%Samex_Comex> Force curling
[1:12:51] <+silvery_cricket> CBT is a path to the darkside
[1:13:01] <MrDante7> you may only wallrun on the pre designated wallrun walls
[1:13:07] <%Jachibel> Stim-Abuse is a path to the Dark Side
[1:13:26] <AnacondaVirtue> It's an old Clone Trooper, Eli
[1:13:34] <ziggyjesus> We could tell that by the wounds on his body
[1:13:40] <+silvery_cricket> Because they are an asshole Eli
[1:13:45] <yoruichi12345> It's an Ex Jedi. do they make any sense Plague?
[1:13:45] <MrDante7> you cant do this yet
[1:13:47] <ziggyjesus> Why did they bother to tell us
[1:13:51] <+silvery_cricket> everyone that wears black is comically evil and a huge asshole
[1:13:53] <Jrockoni> so wait that bodies been there for like 9 fucking years?!
[1:14:02] <+photas10> does plague like the game ?
[1:14:29] <%Jachibel> lmao
[1:14:34] <%Jachibel> Enjoy backtracking
[1:14:36] <%Jachibel> for 10 minutes
[1:14:37] <heartlessclown2> climb down from the ledg if you can
[1:14:50] <zaptar13> Dark side jedi murder their own side quite often actually
[1:15:05] <MrDante7> at least in castlevania you can teleport
[1:15:24] <yoruichi12345> I like linear games because games like FF10 and FF13
[1:15:28] <mortelkilll> in games like metroid, levels usually at least are more dondensed
[1:15:31] <AnacondaVirtue> Cause Metroidvanias typically have "better" shortcuts. All the shortcuts in this really only get you back to checkpoints faster, rather than the actual exit.
[1:15:33] <mortelkilll> condensed
[1:15:36] <yoruichi12345> Open world games are so half baked
[1:15:39] <%Jachibel> Those are empty
[1:15:41] <%Jachibel> right
[1:15:48] <%Jachibel> haha silly decorations
[1:15:50] <%Samex_Comex> Cut scene A to cut scene B
[1:16:09] <+crowmium> idk, never liked it myself
[1:16:16] <yoruichi12345> Open world games are more proned to bugs and glitches that ruin the experience
[1:16:52] <mortelkilll> a metroidvania should ideally be packed with natural shortcuts
[1:16:54] <%Jachibel> Time for underwater combat
[1:17:15] <Cyral_Drive> I guess there's an appeal in getting familiar with unexplored areas and mastering them, not sure why it makes sense for this game
[1:17:47] <MrDante7> i dont think it does make sense for this game
[1:17:49] <mortelkilll> this is a very bad exemple of backtracking, good backtracking try to not be obnoxious
[1:17:51] <yoruichi12345> I don't like the whole "open world gud gaem, Linear bad gaem" logic. many people like myself see open world as something that can be more proned to bugs and glitches
[1:18:18] <mortelkilll> i really dont liek this level design
[1:18:23] <mortelkilll> it look so fake
[1:18:25] <MrDante7> me too
[1:18:33] <MrDante7> the level design in this game isn't good
[1:18:41] <mortelkilll> open world game vs linear game depend on my mood
[1:19:02] <mortelkilll> i like the soul compromise of very scripted levels with a bunch of branches
[1:19:13] <theamazingroberto> wat
[1:19:28] <yoruichi12345> I can get behind an open world game if they are focused on how the open world works to benefit the experience, but many a time the open world is just make to look big
[1:19:32] <ziggyjesus> Court Martial that stormtrooper
[1:19:46] <yoruichi12345> and that leads to bugs and glitches that ruin the experience
[1:20:25] <yoruichi12345> there is a reason why japanese games tend to be linear in design
[1:20:25] <mortelkilll> open world is good game game genres that have good movement systems
[1:20:35] <mortelkilll> for game genres
[1:20:48] <@Nightbot> Plague is a youtube animator and also streams at https://picarto.tv/Plague . Also: t-shirts! http://goo.gl/lze8QO
[1:21:25] <yoruichi12345> KH3 used Unreal Engine 4 and there is a number of giant open areas
[1:21:39] <mortelkilll> its weirdass chunks and tunnels
[1:22:04] <mortelkilll> and its so obvious that you re not really outside
[1:22:20] <MrDante7> if you're quick enough you can see the next area is just invisble and the whole thing pop in
[1:22:23] <theamazingroberto> whas that smellllll? it's UNREAL ENGINE
[1:22:35] <ovan20> the game jerk itself? rooGasm
[1:22:42] <MrDante7> do it then jump
[1:22:54] <MrDante7> its not great
[1:23:06] <MrDante7> you can do it while jumping but its probably finicky with the gears
[1:23:20] <MrDante7> @PlagueOfGripes the elevators don't go down
[1:23:28] <MrDante7> you have to use the ice to get down
[1:23:37] <MrDante7> the elevators only go up
[1:23:44] <MrDante7> i dont know its so stupid
[1:23:53] <zaptar13> Because videogames
[1:24:04] <%Scarnehu> they want you to dig up
[1:24:06] <lotharrio> The cogs are there to keep the cosmic clock running. Obviously.
[1:24:10] <i_am_therydon> because that would take thinking.
[1:24:19] <MrDante7> @PlagueOfGripes you can't ride it down
[1:24:35] <MrDante7> they made it so that you cannot ride it down
[1:24:43] <MrDante7> its the dumbest
[1:24:52] <mortelkilll> the elevator only go up because the slide only go down
[1:24:55] <MrDante7> because they made the game so you can't ride it down
[1:25:00] <+photas10> I think theres a way up there to start without the elevator ? idk LOL
[1:25:00] <mortelkilll> its that stupid
[1:25:01] <MrDante7> and its so stupid
[1:25:07] <MrDante7> its so fucking stupid
[1:25:19] <+photas10> nope nvm
[1:25:21] <mortelkilll> they want yo uto get back up and the slide only go down
[1:25:25] <MrDante7> its actually just the fucking stupidest
[1:25:30] <+unclekulikov> Do u know Plague? This will ride Eternal, Shiny & Chrome
[1:25:39] <%Scarnehu> because Jonny Gamedesigner worked really hard on that Gear-based ice slide
[1:26:13] <MrDante7> they're spitroasting that stormtrooper
[1:26:14] <NiktenKing> LUL
[1:26:20] <%Samex_Comex> Oh boy
[1:26:22] <coke_monster> Kreygasm
[1:26:32] <+unclekulikov> take it with them
[1:26:46] <MrDante7> LMAO
[1:27:00] <ziggyjesus> OHH noooo
[1:27:06] <Coffee_JD> thats a bug, he should be firing lol
[1:27:12] <ziggyjesus> The tension disappears
[1:27:35] <MrDante7> chase him down and watch him drift lol
[1:27:36] <mortelkilll> lets not complain about the at-st having mroe than one attack
[1:27:53] <%Samex_Comex> They made them after the Ewoks fucked them up
[1:27:56] <MrDante7> his feet are made of space steel its fine
[1:27:58] <ziggyjesus> Like how resistant the legs are
[1:28:06] <Cyral_Drive> That makes sense
[1:28:08] <yoruichi12345> they did not think that one through
[1:28:14] <SuperVaderMan> You know most games where you fight AT-STs, they just step on you if you get too close. But they had to make it dumber LUL
[1:28:14] <mortelkilll> probably could have gave them a stomp instead
[1:28:17] <%Rezca> a rotating turret phallus gun would be nicer
[1:28:21] <NiktenKing> LUL
[1:28:31] <i_am_therydon> I actually like that he comes out.
[1:28:34] <AnacondaVirtue> You defeated the tank he was driving but he still thought he could beat you
[1:28:37] <mortelkilll> at-st are dumb designs to begin with
[1:28:43] <NiktenKing> Sir.... think about what I just did. Ok then you die.
[1:28:53] <zaptar13> I thought they always had 2 people in those
[1:29:03] <yoruichi12345> Well AT-ST are the original Metal Gears
[1:29:07] <ziggyjesus> The AT-ST fight in the Force Unleashed 2 was more entertaining, you even got a cool finisher where you crush it into a ball
[1:29:33] <mortelkilll> ill be honest, i dont fidn the star wars setting very good
[1:29:38] <MrDante7> his lightsaber is spinning like a windmill, how do we beat him
[1:29:42] <mortelkilll> its dumb idea piled over generic ideas
[1:29:52] <mortelkilll> it can be fun but its never that clever
[1:30:05] <AnacondaVirtue> His eyes bother me the most
[1:30:07] <MrDante7> well, you just described star wars to a T
[1:30:18] <yoruichi12345> think if you crack him open there is .a pearl?
[1:30:38] <LordPubious> lordpu1Larry lordpu1Larry
[1:30:41] <mortelkilll> all the aliens in star wars overall look liek testicles
[1:30:49] <mortelkilll> star wars has ugly aliens
[1:30:49] <yoruichi12345> The aliens in the OT didn't look the best either
[1:31:16] <MrDante7> i can't help but think that cal is drinking monster right now
[1:31:39] <coke_monster> SHE RAN.
[1:31:44] <Nenatab> Based on this cutscene the humans arent looking that hot either.
[1:31:54] <ziggyjesus> ^
[1:32:00] <mortelkilll> humans are kidn of ugly in real life
[1:32:06] <mortelkilll> weird naked monkeys
[1:32:10] <i_am_therydon> there so good they make your eyes pop out like mine.
[1:32:43] <MrDante7> sounds like its your fault that everyone died
[1:32:56] <mortelkilll> lets be honest jedis sucks
[1:32:59] <+unclekulikov> SPACE FARMER
[1:33:01] <zaptar13> That's precisely what happened.
[1:33:02] <SuperVaderMan> gardening PogChamp
[1:33:06] <%Samex_Comex> Oh boy Kelp
[1:33:32] <+unclekulikov> Force Knot
[1:33:34] <%AzureSkyKnight> Float?
[1:33:42] <i_am_therydon> saber throw?
[1:33:53] <Jrockoni> fuck it give Cal Force Fire. let's throw in the weird EU shit!
[1:33:54] <AnacondaVirtue> Double jump. Big problem with this game's "power fantasy" is that by the end...you're no more powerful than any other jerkoff Jedi
[1:33:59] <zaptar13> You also get yellow and purple.
[1:34:05] <MrDante7> you get such the basic bitch powers
[1:34:31] <mortelkilll> i wish i could get a star wars story where the hero is a not-evil sith
[1:34:33] <Tiny_Axolotl> So we have pink sabers?
[1:34:35] <mortelkilll> like they used to be
[1:34:52] <MrDante7> or a star wars story where the hero is a force user, who doesns't follow either dogma
[1:35:19] <zaptar13> Wasn't grey jedi a thing? @mrdante7
[1:35:19] <mortelkilll> maybe
[1:35:25] <Paralurx> I have a replica lightsaber or 2, can confirm they are designed to suck ass to hold
[1:35:36] <+Lifes_A_Lich> I like the orange
[1:36:24] <yoruichi12345> Jorus C'Boath was the first Dark Jedi. and he was a CLONE!
[1:36:36] <MrDante7> where is the jedi who uses their power exclusively to cheat at chess and become the best player in the galaxy
[1:36:48] <SuperVaderMan> Sith have their own philosophy, dark jedi are just assholes
[1:37:20] <mortelkilll> its a shame all alive sith are evil
[1:37:24] <zaptar13> Aren't the Sith both a species as well as a philosophy?
[1:37:52] <SuperVaderMan> ye
[1:38:04] <MrDante7> yeah there is the sith species
[1:38:10] <mortelkilll> obsession with power is a lto of sith downfall
[1:38:11] <MrDante7> aren't they extinct by this point
[1:38:12] <yoruichi12345> @zaptar13 yes and that's dumb
[1:38:40] <i_am_therydon> i think you actually have to be evil to have dark side powers. like not being evil physically weakens you.
[1:38:50] <+tspeed95> Go to Bogano, trust me
[1:39:18] <AnacondaVirtue> Unless the story directly guides you back to a planet, you're not gonna miss anything.
[1:40:00] <Jrockoni> the sith always talk about the force like it's a tool. yet it always ends up making them do stupid shit. God I'd love a force user who just treats the force like a tool, and actually live a fairly ok life.
[1:40:17] <ziggyjesus> Remember "Droid Rights" in Solo?
[1:40:18] <AnacondaVirtue> Droids are the most horrific thing about Star Wars. Their entire existence is a nightmare
[1:40:28] <lotharrio> Man, they really need to address the droid thing, one day. I guess their inability to use the Force proves that they lack personhood?
[1:40:36] <Lord_Siking> And yet droids seem sentient in the star wars universe lol
[1:40:51] <@Nightbot> Plague is a youtube animator and also streams at https://picarto.tv/Plague . Also: t-shirts! http://goo.gl/lze8QO
[1:40:57] <AnacondaVirtue> It's not really going insane as it is developing personality. Which isn't something you want in a slave.
[1:40:58] <mortelkilll> so droids need to die once in a while? that actually do make sense
[1:41:02] <SuperVaderMan> It sucks to be a droid in star wars LUL
[1:41:31] <%CommanderSqueaks> THEY TURN OFF THE PRINTER, FUCKING KILL THOSE FUCKERS>
[1:41:43] <%Samex_Comex> Beep zeep boop
[1:41:59] <MrDante7> this planet is an active battlezone
[1:42:03] <mortelkilll> i think we ve established the empire are 99% incompetent
[1:42:04] <vaderxyz1970> Why don't Starwars droids become a rampant AI like Skynet?
[1:42:06] <MrDante7> and they just go right by them
[1:42:07] <SuperVaderMan> Blockades never do shit in star wars LUL
[1:42:29] <%CommanderSqueaks> @vaderxyz1970 Because then you blow the entire universe out of the water.
[1:42:29] <HiddenPorpoise> Oh fuck, they do have windows
[1:42:29] <zaptar13> The imperials are really lax with that sort of thing
[1:42:33] <HiddenPorpoise> EVERYWHERE
[1:42:37] <ziggyjesus> Why even have the blockade in the first place
[1:42:45] <mortelkilll> at least the droids had an excuse to be dumb
[1:42:50] <%Samex_Comex> Nooo my people!
[1:42:51] <mortelkilll> they were very basic ais
[1:42:54] <MrDante7> the bad guys are the stupidest, but they are able to manage a galaxy wide empire
[1:43:06] <AnacondaVirtue> Rebels using whatever ships they could get
[1:43:23] <lotharrio> Heh. Pat liked him.
[1:43:24] <%CommanderSqueaks> I'll be honest, I tuned into this game for hot alien babes, and I have been sorely disapointed so far.
[1:43:34] <MrDante7> its cuz pat looks like him
[1:43:44] <Jrockoni> @mrdante7 to be fair it last like what less then 20 years and theirs rebellion for over half of it.
[1:43:46] <%CommanderSqueaks> @MrDante7 Pat's sideburns aren't that amazing.
[1:43:46] <%Samex_Comex> He's the monkey thing from Solo
[1:43:55] <yoruichi12345> It's the model
[1:43:56] <MrDante7> fair @CommanderSqueaks
[1:43:58] <Thorlnn> snail people
[1:44:11] <mortelkilll> the more stars wars i see, the more i realised i never really liekd star wars
[1:44:13] <SuperVaderMan> Her eyes bulge on top of the humans' eyes being too big in this game
[1:44:24] <mortelkilll> its such a dumb and simplistic setting
[1:44:24] <zaptar13> Something about slave wookies and don't die.
[1:44:25] <%CommanderSqueaks> I was about to say, that water is nice.
[1:44:34] <+QuasartheHero> Im also kinda shocked that only 1 sith used a sheild with his light saber
[1:44:37] <Lord_Siking> lol really
[1:44:38] <MrDante7> you need to witness the setpiece
[1:44:50] <SuperVaderMan> Vistas PogChamp
[1:44:51] <%Samex_Comex> It's a fat AT-AT
[1:44:52] <mortelkilll> its weird that shields arent a thing
[1:44:53] <Lord_Siking> You have to manually move but in reality youre still in a cutscene
[1:44:57] <%CommanderSqueaks> @SuperVaderMan See, I'm really nervous about critiquing character models in this game cause I'd hate for the response to be "Um, that's just how the actor/actress looks. They based the model off them."
[1:45:13] <yoruichi12345> I rathe have them be a full blown cutscene (even in game) than this "totally interact-able" cutscene
[1:45:22] <mortelkilll> pretty sure the bugeyes arent the actresses
[1:45:32] <ziggyjesus> They need to base the model off of attractive people
[1:45:53] <yoruichi12345> it reminds me of the 'walking scenes where you are forced to walk while someone exposits info" deal
[1:45:54] <mortelkilll> heh, i think we re too obsessed with attractive people in media
[1:45:57] <zaptar13> How far out into the sea are we?
[1:46:00] <mortelkilll> its ok to have peopel that arent pretty
[1:46:05] <MrDante7> or the fact that more people don't use traditional projectile weapons against jedi
[1:46:28] <%CommanderSqueaks> You think after decades and decades of AT-AT's having GLARING weaknesses, they'd just decomission the fucking things.
[1:46:30] <MrDante7> like a jedi wouldn't be able to handle a squad of modern soldiers
[1:46:37] <i_am_therydon> how long has that been in the water for vines to grow? how did the imperials get inside?
[1:46:41] <%Samex_Comex> Big robot elephant
[1:46:42] <%CommanderSqueaks> @MrDante7 Most of them can actually aim.
[1:46:43] <zaptar13> @mrdante7 they use something called slug throwers that are basically normal shotguns.
[1:46:57] <MrDante7> i know they exist, but they're underutilized
[1:47:00] <+Lifes_A_Lich> I don't think people should have to look pretty / handsome. But I do think they should look cool in a star wars game.
[1:47:00] <yoruichi12345> look at how they keep missing intentionally
[1:47:22] <SuperVaderMan> Gotta appreciate every square inch of this walker
[1:47:31] <AnacondaVirtue> Other end
[1:47:52] <mortelkilll> at-at alway kind of just shot at nothing
[1:47:56] <%CommanderSqueaks> @Lifes_A_Lich To be fair, the bug-eyed lady DOES have my attention in every scene she is, so she's captivating if nothiong else.
[1:48:09] <yoruichi12345> I guess? again, this wouldn't be anywhere as bad if this was a cutscene or an ingame cutscene
[1:48:11] <khanani97> Shooting is the only way they can interact with the world, its tragic really ...
[1:48:12] <BatQuest> You're not supposed to think about it I guess.
[1:48:30] <%CommanderSqueaks> Let's just assume all AT-AT's have super tinted windows and leave it at that.
[1:48:31] <Cyral_Drive> There's a lot of stuff you're not supposed to think about
[1:48:35] <lewbitw> why are you so angry? OMG who hurt you?
[1:48:38] <bear_breaker20> baited
[1:48:47] <zaptar13> Seems a lot larger from the inside?
[1:48:51] <mortelkilll> great, theyr having mortal kombat
[1:49:00] <SuperVaderMan> just leaves LUL
[1:49:11] <+Lifes_A_Lich> @commandersqueaks fair enough I suppose. I just wish the armored sith lady didn't take her mask off. She looked so cool, didn't need to take her helmet off.
[1:49:30] <%CommanderSqueaks> @Lifes_A_Lich They PAID for that actress, fuck you they're getting their money's worth.
[1:49:35] <MrDante7> @Lifes_A_Lich i wish more people refused to take off their masks, or at least put it back on
[1:49:40] <bear_breaker20> storm trooper for mortal kombat tho
[1:50:00] <bear_breaker20> games already poggers anyway
[1:50:11] <TwinBat> you have a double bladed saber for too many people
[1:50:12] <+Lifes_A_Lich> @commandersqueaks is that the deal with kylo rented too? LUL
[1:50:14] <i_am_therydon> no that's from the tie fighter crash
[1:50:22] <+Lifes_A_Lich> ren*
[1:50:36] <Mikers29> You would think one storm trooper wouldnt know what a jedi was,
[1:50:39] <SuperVaderMan> he has a family LUL
[1:50:41] <Lord_Siking> pre-9/11 cockpit
[1:50:42] <AnacondaVirtue> That corpse you "scanned" on Zeffo was a Clone Trooper. They got killed during Order 66
[1:50:48] <%CommanderSqueaks> @Lifes_A_Lich You know every human character that has a face here is based off their actor, who is probably 'somebody' to someone.
[1:50:53] <khanani97> Care about these jobbers, they have family family family
[1:50:54] <Cyral_Drive> oh noey he has familey
[1:51:09] <yoruichi12345> again, this annoys me that they don't realize this
[1:51:52] <SuperVaderMan> cool helmets
[1:51:55] <Lord_Siking> Good helmets
[1:52:01] <TheLastVoodooman> that was the lightest headbump I have ever seen
[1:52:02] <vaderxyz1970> What is a Kashyk vacation? Infinite splash mountain?
[1:52:10] <TheLastVoodooman> <and they are wearing helmts..
[1:52:13] <mortelkilll> time to kill all their friends
[1:52:19] <SuperVaderMan> Helmets, things that are designed to protect your head. Ah, just lightly bump them together, that'll knock them out
[1:52:22] <Cyral_Drive> and then they got back up and shot him
[1:52:22] <+Lifes_A_Lich> @commandersqueaks I'm not saying they look bad, I just like masked bad guys. It's why everyone likes the empire more than the rebels. The troopers look neat.
[1:52:37] <%CommanderSqueaks> I mean really, do they NEED a giant mobile platform to fire the equivalent of Tie-Fighter lasers?
[1:52:40] <bear_breaker20> you looked at him wrong
[1:52:42] <SuperVaderMan> What's that lying on the ground, is that the script
[1:52:44] <Lord_Siking> If you explore you can find the script on the floor
[1:52:53] <ziggyjesus> Didn't the dude on coms just tell you
[1:53:01] <BatQuest> A little hologram man said "Hey wait that's not legal" so I guess they put the situation together way faster than most empire goons.
[1:53:08] <ziggyjesus> The droid just quickly turned then off
[1:53:10] <%Samex_Comex> Yooo you get to drive it
[1:53:25] <MrDante7> you get to drive it but its on rails, more like a turret sequence
[1:53:26] <VoxFoxWatch> “The script says that at 25:32 on the time stamp, we become enemies with THAT ship.” “Alright.”
[1:53:28] <Lord_Siking> its because of the force
[1:53:31] <%Samex_Comex> Aw
[1:53:33] <faykeyfake> his arm looks detached from his body
[1:53:35] <%CommanderSqueaks> It's like if you took Metal Gear and strapped a pair of 30 mm turrets to it. Kind of a waste of space.
[1:53:46] <Lord_Siking> atpRtsd
[1:53:49] <mortelkilll> i feel like that one guy not understanding that this is how we enjoy games
[1:53:58] <TheLastVoodooman> oh thats the one dude from rogue 1?
[1:54:04] <khanani97> oh my gaaaaaaaaaaaaawd
[1:54:05] <SuperVaderMan> Yeah he's the rogue one guy
[1:54:09] <ziggyjesus> HEY ITS FORREST WITIKER
[1:54:12] <+Lifes_A_Lich> just climbs up to talk to you lol
[1:54:16] <%CommanderSqueaks> Okay, real talk. I like this guy already. Just jump in front of the window "The fuck is going on? Okay you seem cool, let's rock."
[1:54:18] <khanani97> did they animate his lazy eye?
[1:54:26] <mortelkilll> yeah thats a nice scene
[1:54:26] <ziggyjesus> Whitaker*
[1:54:30] <Nenatab> This feels like one of those 4D rides at an amusement park.
[1:54:36] <TheLastVoodooman> Forrest Witiker appearing on my wind shield, story of my life
[1:54:37] <Lord_Siking> RLM has a good commentary on rogue one
[1:54:42] <tiger_guard> what is the next product? :O
[1:55:03] <MrDante7> is he gonna tell his troops to suicide bomb the empire
[1:55:10] <+ActualGoober> CUSTERDDD
[1:55:22] <+polypolipauli> BOILED CUSTARD?? DOES THAT MEAN EGGNOG?
[1:55:33] <%CommanderSqueaks> I'm surprised the momentum of his giant balls didn't send him flying when he swung in front of the window.
[1:56:07] <tiger_guard> what difficulty is this on? :O
[1:56:10] <MrDante7> that man is a hero
[1:56:19] <vaderxyz1970> Pathetic
[1:56:20] <shevan123> so are you having fun with this plague
[1:56:57] <mortelkilll> i dont like most competitive games
[1:57:09] <mortelkilll> more of a single player/coop guy
[1:57:15] <mortelkilll> its ok
[1:57:23] <shevan123> i think its cuz its a turret section
[1:57:36] <%CommanderSqueaks> It feels like you're overpowered, but don't really have swarms of enemies to mow down to make you feel big and strong.
[1:57:37] <mortelkilll> yeah pretty much, thats not what we came in the game for
[1:57:39] <vaderxyz1970> look up
[1:57:43] <+Lifes_A_Lich> It makes the troopers look even more dumb just kinda filing in like they usually do just to get blown up.
[1:57:49] <%CommanderSqueaks> Like, there should be dozens upon dozens of storm troopers for you to wipe out right now.
[1:57:53] <AnacondaVirtue> Look up
[1:58:11] <bear_breaker20> just destroy property cause thats helpful
[1:58:15] <AnacondaVirtue> Nah it's one of the usual shuttles. Just has the wings in a different position
[1:58:16] <%CommanderSqueaks> I want to murder hundreds of Storm Troopers before this set piece is over.
[1:58:18] <bear_breaker20> who needs ships
[1:58:25] <faykeyfake> star wars is dumb
[1:58:28] <lotharrio> Looks a bit like an Imperial shuttle.
[1:58:31] <mortelkilll> at least its not bs hard
[1:58:45] <yoruichi12345> It's that Emperor like ship from RotJ without the top sail
[1:58:47] <%CommanderSqueaks> Also, the scene is kind of flaccid, besides that one explosion, nothing has any impact.
[1:58:49] <mortelkilll> id rather something be too easy than too hard if its just a novelty weird gameplay section
[1:58:50] <shevan123> that little beep beep he did was "fuckin no, sir"
[1:59:03] <%Samex_Comex> Aw man it's broken
[1:59:08] <vaderxyz1970> Seatbelts a tech not yet discovered
[1:59:10] <+Lifes_A_Lich> He braced himself for impact by pressing himself against the window
[1:59:54] <AnacondaVirtue> No. But he's that dumb Wookie from Episode 3 with the dreads and skulls
[1:59:58] <yoruichi12345> Didn't Dragon Quest 11 do this and that isn't exactly triple A?
[2:00:02] <lotharrio> I think his dad's name is Stinky.
[2:00:06] <SuperVaderMan> taarful was that other wookiee that saw yoda launch away in his space egg
[2:00:20] <tiger_guard> I played this game without much knowledge about Star wars and still liked it.
[2:00:21] <+sourceofall> vegeta's dumb brother from that special?
[2:00:22] <%Samex_Comex> Wookies!
[2:00:35] <+ActualGoober> "hey let's just throw the established gameplay elements away for an unskippable minigame that we transplanted into the middle of the game's story" - some AAA studios
[2:00:37] <+Lifes_A_Lich> The holiday special has all the fun stuff though!
[2:00:53] <bear_breaker20> hes cool cause capes
[2:00:54] <lotharrio> I checked, I was close, it was Itchy. Short for Attichitcuk.
[2:01:05] <SuperVaderMan> taarful was the one wookiee in republic commando too I think
[2:01:07] <%CommanderSqueaks> @Lifes_A_Lich Let's be straight with eachother, have you actually watched the Holiday special? Reviews and clips don't count.
[2:01:07] <lotharrio> That's right, Chewie's dad is literally a -cuk
[2:01:07] <vaderxyz1970> He's the woolie general from revenge of the sith
[2:01:11] <khanani97> omg it took me this long to notice that greez has 4 arms, that freaked me out
[2:01:22] <MrDante7> tarfful was also in republic commando
[2:01:32] <Magpiejake> @PlagueOfGripes the Mandolorian mentions Life Day, so thats cannon
[2:01:35] <$atlasbot1> jermaJup1 jermaJup2
[2:01:41] <mortelkilll> there a plot?
[2:01:41] <$atlasbot1> jermaJup3 jermaJup4
[2:01:54] <tiger_guard> something.
[2:02:04] <+Lifes_A_Lich> Life day is canon now? LUL
[2:02:13] <MrDante7> life day has never left canon
[2:02:14] <Magpiejake> yup
[2:02:17] <SuperVaderMan> oh yeah we're looking for a dumb holocron or something
[2:02:27] <bear_breaker20> cause wookies deserve freedom LUL
[2:02:33] <%CommanderSqueaks> For a race of super strong giants, the Wookies are a very easily cowed species.
[2:02:34] <tiger_guard> !uptime
[2:02:34] <@Nightbot> 2 hours 2 minutes 44 seconds
[2:02:42] <Tiny_Axolotl> Who’s the big bad besides the emperor?
[2:02:50] <%CommanderSqueaks> @Tiny_Axolotl The Inquisitor.
[2:03:22] <mortelkilll> i dont like the jedis much
[2:03:22] <MrDante7> like why would cal give a shit to help the wookies
[2:03:26] <Tiny_Axolotl> @commandersqueaks those guys from SW rebels?
[2:03:28] <tiger_guard> ...but the jedis are selfless. :P
[2:03:34] <+Lifes_A_Lich> The wookies are kinda always getting fucked up
[2:03:42] <mortelkilll> the jedis arent really selfless, theyr more control freaks
[2:03:44] <Heyestus> Jedi always seem so bland. The only thing they ever seem to get i, "oh my dark side is taking over oooOOoo"
[2:03:54] <mortelkilll> the dark side not even bad
[2:04:00] <%CommanderSqueaks> Which is funny, cause Luke in the original trilogy had a lot of personal motivation...
[2:04:04] <mortelkilll> they are obsessed fighting with somethig nthats not bad
[2:04:10] <ziggyjesus> OHHH MAN
[2:04:12] <mortelkilll> and then they wodner why they are corrupted and messed up
[2:04:13] <%Samex_Comex> Aw man they look gross
[2:04:18] <SuperVaderMan> Yeah you'd think he would at least be motivated by his one friend dying, but nah, not much
[2:04:23] <tiger_guard> yeah tbh...even with my limited star wars knowledge siths are cooler as compared to jedis
[2:04:24] <%CommanderSqueaks> The KOTOR wookies looked better.
[2:04:24] <bear_breaker20> your a mean one mr grinch
[2:04:24] <lotharrio> Oh man... is this game racist, now?
[2:04:27] <ziggyjesus> They look like Turkish men, not wookies
[2:04:34] <Heyestus> Aushwookies :(
[2:04:36] <MrDante7> it also sounds like the same sound that's been recycled for 20 years
[2:04:40] <yoruichi12345> I tried . arguing with a Star Wars fanatic about how Leia had this problem in the original Star Wars and they were like "SHE HAS A GOOD MOTIVATION BECAUSE SHE'S TRYING TO STOP THE EMPIRE!"
[2:04:41] <+Lifes_A_Lich> Eh, they got tossed in prisons and junk
[2:04:50] <NiktenKing> These are no the Wookies you are looking for...
[2:04:55] <NiktenKing> *not
[2:04:55] <%CommanderSqueaks> @SuperVaderMan Has he actually talked about that guy once since he died, thought about him, mentioned him at all?
[2:05:10] <MrDante7> @CommanderSqueaks no
[2:05:12] <AnacondaVirtue> Scan the Gonk. You must
[2:05:17] <%CommanderSqueaks> The dude literally took a lightsaber to protect him, you think this tool would give two fucks about it.
[2:05:38] <SuperVaderMan> I think he comes up sometimes whenever cal's having a nightmare sequence, but he's not really part of cal's motivation at all
[2:05:48] <yoruichi12345> people tend to think 'good motivation' equals "StOp ThE BaD GuYs" in the Star Wars community
[2:05:50] <Ynkubus18> G O N K
[2:05:54] <%CommanderSqueaks> I feel like characters who are on the path to BECOMING Jedi are infinitely more interesting characters than actual Jedi.
[2:05:55] <mortelkilll> most characters dont have good motives in star wars
[2:05:57] <yoruichi12345> G O N K
[2:06:10] <bear_breaker20> all star wars games should be able to tip over gonk droids like the worthless things they are
[2:06:19] <SuperVaderMan> I thought they were just mobile batteries, yeah
[2:06:35] <+Lifes_A_Lich> Cause it's a cute little droid
[2:06:41] <SuperVaderMan> Gonks can be as illogical as they want to be
[2:06:42] <MrDante7> because you aren't allowed to retcon the original trilogy
[2:06:42] <Heyestus> Because space fantasy
[2:06:46] <yoruichi12345> don't diss the Gonk droid
[2:06:47] <%CommanderSqueaks> If you can't summarize a character's motivation in a single concise sentence, that's a bad character. Paraphrasing Red-Letter media a lot, but it's so true.
[2:06:48] <mortelkilll> awwww
[2:06:49] <BatQuest> Even our power sources must feel pain and know existential dread, apparently.
[2:06:50] <tiger_guard> because its futuristic...everything needs to be a robot. XD
[2:07:09] <$atlasbot1> i like the republic designs and its cool seeing them
[2:07:11] <+Lifes_A_Lich> I wanna see him as your sidekick, running really fast after you with his little feet.
[2:07:18] <gl0vesup7> What a lad
[2:07:20] <SuperVaderMan> Oh no, the wookie has toes
[2:07:21] <Tempmael> hes made of straw
[2:07:25] <shevan123> that wookie looks so lanky holy fuck
[2:07:31] <Tiny_Axolotl> Looks like a trachcan
[2:07:41] <gl0vesup7> Lanky Kong wookie
[2:07:43] <mortelkilll> is it a hot take to say that the trade federation had a better motive than any other vilain in star wars?
[2:07:59] <MrDante7> @mortelkilll no because you're right
[2:08:00] <Heyestus> those wookies remind me of those cat models that morphed into the human skeletons in the sims3
[2:08:10] <mortelkilll> also their droid army was badass
[2:08:25] <mortelkilll> i liked these guys
[2:08:38] <mortelkilll> its a shame the new game and movies go back to the stupdi stormtroopers
[2:08:39] <thecrazyanbu> What was their motivation again?
[2:08:40] <Tiny_Axolotl> The rebels should get their hands on the droid army.
[2:08:52] <mortelkilll> independance
[2:08:59] <mortelkilll> so they wouldnt have to conform to the senate rules
[2:09:06] <thecrazyanbu> So they just wanted out of the republic?
[2:09:08] <shevan123> and you get to trick out your man and make him look cool
[2:09:10] <+Lifes_A_Lich> I wonder if they actually have costumes in this other than ponchos
[2:09:10] <gl0vesup7> Why did the empire abandon droid armies
[2:09:11] <Heyestus> That's not gonna help our third quarter's profits, Plague.
[2:09:12] <mortelkilll> pretty much
[2:09:22] <SuperVaderMan> The republic was kinda shitty at that point ye
[2:09:39] <mortelkilll> probably money too
[2:09:46] <mortelkilll> like they wanted something like free market
[2:10:08] <mortelkilll> and republic forced the mto abide to stupdi rules where they couldnt make good money
[2:10:13] <mortelkilll> im just basing that on the name
[2:10:21] <fusedforms> conceptually the droid armies are great. practically I never got why they made shit droids as well as good ones.
[2:10:23] <thecrazyanbu> Well if I'm remembering right the reason why they wanted independence is so they could get out of the regulations that were holding back their business's
[2:10:25] <fusedforms> just build droidekas for days
[2:10:26] <mortelkilll> people dont call themselves the trade federation if they dont have money in their goal
[2:10:27] <tiger_guard> aren't most signs are painted yellow..I think yellow in general is more noticeable.
[2:10:28] <+Lifes_A_Lich> uncanny valley?
[2:10:29] <Heyestus> Thin men
[2:10:44] <shevan123> that yellow skin made the ship look like a thunderbird
[2:10:48] <gl0vesup7> Lol
[2:10:53] <Heartless_01> creepy
[2:11:03] <gl0vesup7> Cryptid wookies
[2:11:03] <yoruichi12345> Sounds like the Star Wars equivalent of albinos
[2:11:22] <tiger_guard> @Heyestus snek men
[2:11:30] <MrDante7> why can't you just cut the power cable with your lightsaber
[2:11:34] <$atlasbot1> a sleep paralysis demon?
[2:11:39] <BlueLunecy> If only you had a powerful cutting tool
[2:11:41] <mortelkilll> is the stream going much longer? wanna buy stuff but dont want to miss the end
[2:11:41] <TheDastardlyD> You little robot shorts the circuit and explodes
[2:11:58] <SuperVaderMan> hello monkey man
[2:12:02] <+Lifes_A_Lich> He's sad D:
[2:12:07] <+BaronVonThule> Reminds me of the monkeys from KOTOR
[2:12:07] <A_High_Ordinator> Wookies are strength builds
[2:12:18] <bear_breaker20> chill monkey chad
[2:12:37] <thecrazyanbu> The main guy keeps on dabbing
[2:13:06] <jiin6> park bench to eat a sandwhich
[2:13:12] <gl0vesup7> @thecrazyanbu it’s the most powerful Jedi technique
[2:13:18] <thecrazyanbu> Force dab
[2:13:27] <TheDastardlyD> you can slice the cables
[2:13:44] <TheDastardlyD> monkey too depressed to continue on
[2:13:54] <+Lifes_A_Lich> He's just sittin there
[2:13:55] <Heyestus> he looks troubled
[2:13:59] <jiin6> its like they wanted monkey man ded? Curse you EA
[2:14:05] <mortelkilll> hes a wise shit throwing sage
[2:14:08] <AnacondaVirtue> They look way cooler than Wookies
[2:14:16] <thecrazyanbu> I want that monkey to smoke a joint and speak in an old german man voice
[2:14:30] <bear_breaker20> do germans into weed?
[2:14:35] <thecrazyanbu> Maybe?
[2:14:45] <+Lifes_A_Lich> The monkey is probably sad watching the jedi have all the fun climbing on things.
[2:14:52] <SuperVaderMan> Rakata, who may or may not be canon anymore, because there was a kotor ship in Rogue One technically
[2:15:11] <jiin6> it did so much damage
[2:15:15] <+Prattlesworth> What a bastard spider
[2:15:19] <fusedforms> impolite
[2:15:24] <HyLarryous> What Kotor ship was in Rogue One?
[2:15:26] <TheDastardlyD> Wow it slowed its web ball too
[2:15:27] <thecrazyanbu> The main guy seems like he's a druggie
[2:15:40] <thecrazyanbu> Taking all of those stims
[2:15:42] <SuperVaderMan> it was the big hammerhead ship
[2:15:45] <Heyestus> I like how all enemies are made of some sort of metal that gets superheated when you cut into them like the doors do
[2:16:01] <jiin6> Wyyyychok sounds like the sound you make when it jumps you
[2:16:22] <HyLarryous> I think they just decided to use that ship design, don't think they canonized anything else from kotor
[2:16:23] <TheLastVoodooman> that makes the name very wookie though
[2:16:51] <TheLastVoodooman> strange since they only make bear sounds themself
[2:16:53] <AnacondaVirtue> You get that later, unfortunately.
[2:17:11] <TheDastardlyD> I spent a while in this room you come back for that way later
[2:17:23] <HyLarryous> Same
[2:17:42] <jiin6> looks like a come back thing...
[2:18:06] <MrDante7> it should always be the equivalent of a door
[2:18:14] <MrDante7> some type of progress that opens up to get stuff, not this
[2:18:19] <fusedforms> @MrDante7 exactly
[2:18:27] <A_High_Ordinator> Now if only the player-character could do a force jump.
[2:18:52] <gl0vesup7> @a_high_ordinator lol I hate that shit in video games
[2:18:55] <tiger_guard> he needs to use the force :O
[2:19:05] <Heyestus> The super metroid jump room with that spooky skull is the best version of this
[2:19:15] <gl0vesup7> Why can’t you just use the thing
[2:19:22] <Heyestus> you cannot make the jump and it is very clear
[2:19:23] <+blackwolf828> How long has he been going?
[2:19:44] <+Prattlesworth> !uptime
[2:19:44] <@Nightbot> 2 hours 19 minutes 54 seconds
[2:20:07] <MrDante7> its almost like this game was made from a mishmash of ideas that weren't fully thought out
[2:20:26] <+blackwolf828> Force slow also works for it
[2:20:33] <ziggyjesus> This game is just bland, like oatmeal
[2:20:47] <@Nightbot> Plague is a youtube animator and also streams at https://picarto.tv/Plague . Also: t-shirts! http://goo.gl/lze8QO
[2:20:56] <A_High_Ordinator> Bearbugs
[2:21:18] <%CommanderSqueaks> I love when the game beats itself for me.
[2:21:19] <ziggyjesus> I wish they either focused on the combat and action or did something more than walk around the wild
[2:21:38] <TheLastVoodooman> sooo...forced ubnleashed?
[2:21:41] <TheLastVoodooman> unleashed*
[2:21:42] <ziggyjesus> like go to an urban area and interact with other people with their own plans
[2:21:49] <TheDastardlyD> Get used to that
[2:21:51] <Heyestus> force attach
[2:21:51] <TheDastardlyD> :)
[2:22:20] <gl0vesup7> You can see the rope clip through his dick
[2:22:21] <ziggyjesus> For all the crap Force Unleashed got, it was atleast a fun action game
[2:22:48] <TheLastVoodooman> I loved the first one though
[2:22:48] <MrDante7> tree sap bomb
[2:22:53] <%CommanderSqueaks> "Powerful compound" Okay, what does it actually do?
[2:22:56] <gl0vesup7> Force unleashed 1 is actually good
[2:22:57] <Tempmael> gotta get that sap
[2:23:05] <%CommanderSqueaks> @MrDante7 He didn't say bomb, he just said "Powerful."
[2:23:09] <MrDante7> damnit
[2:23:09] <TheDastardlyD> This game doesn't let you abuse enemies with telekinesis as much as the force unleashed
[2:23:14] <MrDante7> my brain autocompleted bomb
[2:23:21] <%CommanderSqueaks> Yes, he did.
[2:23:26] <thecrazyanbu> It's where Palpatine gets his weed from
[2:23:30] <TheLastVoodooman> give it better writing. some kotor like open galaxy and then you get a damn fine game
[2:23:30] <+blackwolf828> I mean, he has a lightsaber clearly at his side
[2:23:32] <ziggyjesus> Yeah, the first one was good, idk why people didn't like the second game as much
[2:23:36] <fusedforms> "take your lightsaber" good advice I figured you'd leave it on the ship
[2:23:38] <MrDante7> the first thing cal does is say he's a jedi
[2:23:47] <AnacondaVirtue> Yes. You told him you got the saber from your master.
[2:23:57] <i_am_therydon> 2nd force unleashed wasn't as long or as destructible.
[2:23:57] <gl0vesup7> Nah the force unleashed 2 was absolute garbage
[2:24:05] <%CommanderSqueaks> No, he literally did.
[2:24:16] <Tempmael> he saw your laser sword
[2:24:20] <TheDastardlyD> Some ginger
[2:24:21] <tiger_guard> He did introduce him as a jedi
[2:24:21] <HiddenPorpoise> He says he is a Jedi first thing
[2:24:26] <cerazor01> Forrest Whittaker's character is from Clone Wars
[2:24:32] <ziggyjesus> The commander or whoever checked in on your ATST and saw you were piloting it
[2:24:33] <+Lifes_A_Lich> You got a lightsaber that's good enough for most people.
[2:24:34] <cerazor01> I think he has experience in Jedi stuff
[2:24:37] <%CommanderSqueaks> Well he then did cool lightsaber shit, so either he's a Sith, but Imperials aren't clever enough to lie like this.
[2:24:51] <ziggyjesus> You also showed Whitaker your lightsaber
[2:25:15] <%CommanderSqueaks> When ginger mcyoungface started doing flips and deflecting lasers, Whittaker was like "okay you're legit."
[2:25:15] <lotharrio> Storm Troopers do it for kicks.
[2:25:23] <gl0vesup7> Cool movie thing
[2:25:26] <jiin6> yeah its not like any other people use lightsabers or anything
[2:25:35] <A_High_Ordinator> Become giant
[2:25:39] <Heyestus> Imperial pilots have natural death wishes so they always try tofly as impracticallyas possible.
[2:25:54] <ziggyjesus> TIE piolets are basically Kiowa pilots in Afgansitan
[2:25:58] <TheLastVoodooman> Quick showing off, Space Maverick
[2:26:03] <TheLastVoodooman> NEVER!
[2:26:05] <ziggyjesus> Pilots*
[2:26:06] <fusedforms> "this blandness of character.... could it be?!?! you have inherited the mantle of the main character. no go forth and do everyone else's job."
[2:26:07] <TheDastardlyD> At least they're using more than just X-wings and tie fighters now
[2:26:09] <+blackwolf828> Something something, kyber crystals pick them
[2:26:11] <%CommanderSqueaks> From what I remember is that they're incredibly unwieldy to anyone whose not trained, so you're likely to chop your dick off if you don't know what you're doing.
[2:26:18] <MrDante7> ^
[2:26:18] <TheLastVoodooman> and somehow he is in every star wars game and movie
[2:26:32] <+Lifes_A_Lich> They wanted Grievous to be cool
[2:26:38] <MrDante7> i always wondered why more force users don't use blasters and explosives
[2:26:38] <fusedforms> the force naturally takes phallic shapes
[2:26:40] <ziggyjesus> it would probably be like fighting with a flashlight
[2:26:47] <tiger_guard> especially different colored ones.
[2:26:47] <lotharrio> Extended universe stuff explained why lightsabers are Force user weapons only. But in the movies, it looks like anyone can use them. Han used it to cut open a tonton and then there's Grievous.
[2:26:48] <%CommanderSqueaks> @ziggyjesus That can cut your dick off.
[2:26:49] <kingdovachief> The kids are down with THE DEVIL
[2:26:53] <Heyestus> In the first film Han Solo is actively disparaging of the lightsaber because it's basically useless.
[2:26:56] <MrDante7> like why isn't there a jedi that just throws grenades at people
[2:26:56] <SuperVaderMan> lightsabers are just incredibly useful tools, even if you can't fight with them. You'd think they'd be a lot more ubiquitious
[2:26:56] <yoruichi12345> Again, that was George. Beforehand, Palpatine thought it was just a dumb toy
[2:26:57] <TheDastardlyD> I'm still wondering how the sith are the only ones to figure out the red lightsaber
[2:27:07] <tiger_guard> can someone explain to me why the sith only use red sabers? :O
[2:27:12] <jiin6> By the Emperor's will
[2:27:13] <gl0vesup7> I wish more Jedi/sith used the energy katana
[2:27:22] <%Samex_Comex> I'm trying to get fired
[2:27:23] <TheLastVoodooman> All this talk makes me miss Kyle katarn...
[2:27:25] <MrDante7> the old canon was that red sabers were synthetic and more powerful iirc
[2:27:25] <jiin6> hahah
[2:27:27] <%CommanderSqueaks> @TheDastardlyD I figure the Jedi don't use it cause a red lightersaber is basically just straight up saying "Yeah I'm sith."
[2:27:32] <lotharrio> It seems like it's mostly just not that good as a weapon if you're not a Force user who can parry plasma blasts.
[2:27:33] <SenkoFluff> are you excite for next product too!
[2:27:36] <gl0vesup7> @tiger_guard big red means big evil
[2:27:37] <jiin6> they took a awhile to get a shot in
[2:27:37] <HiddenPorpoise> "Do you want to fill out the fucking form?"
[2:27:40] <TheLastVoodooman> blaster using, 'nade throwing baddass
[2:27:42] <A_High_Ordinator> Blaster jedi would be nearly perfect sharpshooters.
[2:27:48] <TheLastVoodooman> who happened to be Jedi
[2:27:56] <MrDante7> but now the new canon is the crystals have some sentience and the sith force them to obey them and make them "bleed" or some shit
[2:28:03] <Jrockoni> some jedi do use red sabers. most with use them cause their easier to make.
[2:28:06] <+Lifes_A_Lich> @tiger_guard I'm pretty sure there's been some extended universe sith that've used other colors. Just not really in the movies.
[2:28:16] <%CommanderSqueaks> I consider a lightsaber to be like nunchucks, if you don't know what you're doing you're just going to hurt yourself.
[2:28:20] <tiger_guard> so there's nothing stopping the jedi's from using red sabers right?
[2:28:24] <thecrazyanbu> Gotta get the fabled purple lightsaber
[2:28:26] <SuperVaderMan> It's usually a posture thing that you don't realize you're doing
[2:28:27] <TheDastardlyD> thebatGASM
[2:28:32] <%CommanderSqueaks> @tiger_guard Nothing.
[2:28:33] <Heartless_01> gamer stance
[2:28:41] <jiin6> jedi hate the colour red
[2:28:47] <+blackwolf828> Jedi can use red sabers if they want, but after all the thousands of years, its just assumed red is sith
[2:28:51] <MrDante7> the new canon is that the color changes depending upon the person that has the crystal or some shit
[2:29:05] <+Opsbiscuit> I know the Darth Vader series explained that the red crystals are corrupted by dark side stuff or some bullshit
[2:29:14] <gl0vesup7> Purple best color
[2:29:19] <yoruichi12345> Yellow was the Library Jedi though
[2:29:20] <fusedforms> it's fine for movie colour coding but you can't build a universe around it
[2:29:21] <tiger_guard> oh god I didn't know any of this. LUL
[2:29:21] <jiin6> Sith man bad
[2:29:23] <TheDastardlyD> The blood
[2:29:23] <+blackwolf828> Yellow was a rare and honorable color
[2:29:28] <+Lifes_A_Lich> There's white ones in this and they have a bit of lore on them
[2:29:36] <thecrazyanbu> What about a bright pink lightsaber?
[2:29:48] <+blackwolf828> Yellow ones were used a lot by the temple guards
[2:29:49] <Artista_AF> i think that was the only stupid rule they actually explain sorta sensical zoneThink
[2:29:50] <+Opsbiscuit> LUL
[2:30:02] <Heyestus> I liked KOTORs explanation more. Certain crystals just make certain colours and there happened to be only red ones on the sith homeworld.
[2:30:10] <yoruichi12345> yellow isn't considered a bad though
[2:30:13] <jiin6> yellow is the horrible neutral color
[2:30:13] <cerazor01> "LETS HOLD HIM DOWN AND FUCK HIM"
[2:30:17] <%CommanderSqueaks> Are we complaining about Star Wars having a simplistic universe? I thought we all knew this already. Jedi good, Sith bad. Until Kotor 2 and the books introduced actual ambiguity to Star Wars.
[2:30:25] <Jrockoni> I liked the idea of you go into a cave and whatever crystal you got is just the one that spoke to you. no deeper meaning behind the color.
[2:30:34] <MrDante7> iirc the new lore jedi attune to a crystal when they build their lightsaber, and it gets a color based on the person using it. Sith are evil and force the crystal to "bleed" and that yellow or orange are cleansed red crystals
[2:30:38] <TheDastardlyD> Ambiguity bad make brane hurt
[2:30:47] <TheLastVoodooman> all colors have lore. as far as I remember it red is harder to wield, the weapon felt heavier with a harder punch to it, b ut red crystals tended to break cyrcitry in the hilt afaik+
[2:30:48] <+crowmium> I don't think it was that trite. I think the sith used red because that's what was available on the planet where they trained or whatever
[2:30:52] <TheLastVoodooman> jedi hate risks
[2:31:03] <tiger_guard> I never got what the whole force thing is about. I have seen some of the movies..and to me force equals telekinesis.
[2:31:12] <smile64> i heard red crystals were synthetic once
[2:31:13] <TheLastVoodooman> sith didnt have light sabers on their home planet
[2:31:13] <Artista_AF> oh nevermind they retconed the Red = Mass Produced
[2:31:16] <MrDante7> star wars is dumb
[2:31:17] <%CommanderSqueaks> @crowmium Also cause they know it's the coolest looking color and cause all Sith are super edgelords and I can never be convinced otherwise.
[2:31:19] <jiin6> jedi hate the color red
[2:31:25] <TheLastVoodooman> they had sword made litereally from crystal
[2:31:53] <Artista_AF> so... basically Sekiro
[2:31:56] <MrDante7> the problem with that is you have long recovery from block so its hard to parry after blocking
[2:32:09] <MrDante7> so you can't like, mash the parry button like in Sekiro
[2:32:20] <TheDastardlyD> This game turned into sekiro for me towards the end where I'd just wildly slash until the enemy parried me and then I'd do it right back and kill them
[2:32:34] <jiin6> parry this you filthy jedi
[2:32:46] <%CommanderSqueaks> Jedi are limited by the Special Effects budget.
[2:32:48] <+Opsbiscuit> Will the Force bring the kids back FeelsBadMan
[2:33:05] <MrDante7> where is the jedi who shoots ballistic weapons and uses the force to manipulate their trajectories
[2:33:09] <MrDante7> when is Star Wars: Wanted
[2:33:12] <%CommanderSqueaks> When they tried to rationalize it in the prequels, it was terrible.
[2:33:21] <yoruichi12345> IT was suppose to originally suppose to be Space Samurai
[2:33:27] <lotharrio> I mean... it's all basically xianxia Taoism filtered through psychic powers specifically.
[2:33:31] <+Lifes_A_Lich> I wish they'd used more force unleashed series stuff
[2:33:34] <jiin6> nothing makes sense when you start thinking about star wars
[2:33:36] <+Lifes_A_Lich> for force powers
[2:33:39] <%CommanderSqueaks> They want ultimate freedom for themselves, which means killing or subjugating everyone else.
[2:33:48] <fusedforms> the Force is semi-sentient, and it has the mind of a 14yo child
[2:33:56] <tiger_guard> unlimited power!!
[2:33:57] <thecrazyanbu> I thought the reason sith were evil is because they wanted power for power's sake.
[2:33:58] <lotharrio> Pretty sure they're all just pursuing immortality.
[2:34:01] <+payatanharkonnen> Cuz it’s cooollll
[2:34:03] <lotharrio> And lying about the rest.
[2:34:07] <bear_breaker20> its all to help form giga palpatine
[2:34:11] <%CommanderSqueaks> All Sith are basically Vergil from Devil May Cry.
[2:34:21] <+crowmium> basically Lucas is a hack fraud and ruined Jedi in the prequels
[2:34:25] <fusedforms> the Sith want more power for the same reason all villains want power: they love administration
[2:34:46] <+payatanharkonnen> Coooollll
[2:34:57] <TheDastardlyD> To establish the most evil force: trade wars
[2:35:05] <+blackwolf828> A few sith are after immortality
[2:35:06] <+crowmium> OT and EU Jedi/Sith were more consistent
[2:35:22] <Heyestus> Remember when sith didn't exist and there was just a DARK SIDE to the force?
[2:35:38] <+Lifes_A_Lich> You just kinda want things LUL
[2:35:39] <Heartless_01> the vergil syndrome
[2:35:41] <$SilverRoddo> The Jedi either die as heroes, or live long enough to something or other.
[2:35:42] <jiin6> wasn't the whole balance of the force thing just a babysitting super force users
[2:35:47] <%CommanderSqueaks> Remember, the Sith are technically a RACE of people. A bunch of dumb weaboos just thought they were super awesome and co-opted their culture.
[2:35:48] <MrDante7> so dark side is mind break tag
[2:36:12] <bear_breaker20> all dark force users are just collecting force to help giga palpatine manifest physically
[2:36:12] <ziggyjesus> Try the double bladed saber
[2:36:25] <TheDastardlyD> It really is omnidirectional
[2:36:26] <+blackwolf828> Would love if pureblooded sith came back
[2:36:32] <lotharrio> "Mind break, NTR, guro. These are the tools of the dark side." Yoda, 2020
[2:36:35] <gl0vesup7> The Sith are those neckbeards in trench coats and fedoras
[2:36:36] <%CommanderSqueaks> Okay that line was great.
[2:36:43] <%CommanderSqueaks> "Oh no, oh no no oh fuck, oh shit, oh this is bad."
[2:36:45] <+Lifes_A_Lich> I love the stormtrooper banter
[2:36:55] <MrDante7> i wish he actually backed down and ran away or surrendered
[2:37:15] <fusedforms> imagine finding out your universe has some all-pervasive force and it has two modes: boring and edgelord. you could never look at the stars with wonder again.
[2:37:27] <+crowmium> the idea of purge troopers seems stupid
[2:37:33] <%CommanderSqueaks> @fusedforms What about Gray Jedi though?
[2:37:37] <%Samex_Comex> Wait this is the trailer demo they showed of
[2:37:41] <MrDante7> yes it is
[2:37:58] <MrDante7> thats why there is so much clear trailer shots, like the trooper killing those two when you enter
[2:38:01] <lotharrio> My number is huge!
[2:38:11] <TheDastardlyD> The best part about those guys is that they can be pushed off a ledge
[2:38:13] <gl0vesup7> Lol he did that cool flip with his spear
[2:38:17] <mortelkilll> bureaucraty
[2:38:23] <%CommanderSqueaks> To be fair, that dude was having no problem ALSO killing a bunch of Rebel mooks.
[2:38:29] <+crowmium> they hunt down force sensitive people
[2:38:31] <%CommanderSqueaks> So he can multitask.
[2:38:31] <TheDastardlyD> the orange crack
[2:38:58] <TheDastardlyD> Can we just live here
[2:38:58] <Heyestus> Every story makes more jedi who survived the purge so there's probably hundreds of glow-stick boys floating around
[2:38:59] <%CommanderSqueaks> and Kotor 2.
[2:39:04] <%CommanderSqueaks> I will also push Kotor 2.
[2:39:07] <%CommanderSqueaks> **always
[2:39:09] <mortelkilll> light and dark is an artificial concept
[2:39:09] <+blackwolf828> Yea the force is just one thing
[2:39:12] <+Lifes_A_Lich> The movies are very scared of it not being just two things.
[2:39:15] <MrDante7> @CommanderSqueaks i will die on this hill right besides you
[2:39:18] <fusedforms> @CommanderSqueaks the only Grey Jedi I know is Jolee and he just hung out in a forest most of the time. not exactly thrilling.
[2:39:21] <+blackwolf828> Grey jedi get it
[2:39:25] <SuperVaderMan> the force is just the force
[2:39:30] <jiin6> i liked that line Kyle katarn mentions about light and dark powers
[2:39:32] <+crowmium> that's in the NJO series which is also trash
[2:39:38] <+blackwolf828> I mean Revan also eventually gets it
[2:39:40] <gl0vesup7> That’s why grey Jedi are the coolest
[2:39:45] <lotharrio> It's almost like making a religion about how there's good stabbing and bad stabbing is stupid.
[2:39:45] <mortelkilll> bot hthe sith and jedi needed to die
[2:40:08] <MrDante7> kreia was right
[2:40:37] <%CommanderSqueaks> Okay this Flamethrower dude is strong.
[2:40:38] <mortelkilll> tecnically i think jedi and sith could jsut coexist if they didnt constantly obsess over oen another
[2:40:43] <%CommanderSqueaks> That Flamethrower tech is powerful.
[2:40:49] <@Nightbot> Plague is a youtube animator and also streams at https://picarto.tv/Plague . Also: t-shirts! http://goo.gl/lze8QO
[2:40:51] <+Lifes_A_Lich> toasted
[2:40:53] <+crowmium> that wasn't the original concept at all, it just became that because of lots of shit writing
[2:40:55] <Mighty_Quaid> Not true. Especially before the Great Schism
[2:41:00] <gl0vesup7> I like them tho, they say fuck everything
[2:41:05] <%CommanderSqueaks> Flamethrower = Hard Jedi Counter apparently.
[2:41:20] <TheDastardlyD> @CommanderSqueaks is KOTOR 1 worth it? I have both but haven't played them
[2:41:28] <jiin6> benders
[2:41:31] <+IShadowStrykerI> technically grey jedi have 2 meanings and theyre both cool
[2:41:32] <%CommanderSqueaks> @TheDastardlyD HOLY SHIT ABASOLUTELY
[2:41:44] <MrDante7> holy shit go play KOTOR 1 right now
[2:41:49] <lotharrio> Oh, Bendu, like the original name for the Jedi in the early scripts.
[2:41:50] <Heyestus> That sure sounds no-longer-canon to me Eli.
[2:41:52] <jiin6> i do like jolee bindoo
[2:42:00] <TheDastardlyD> ddvgThumbsUp sweet
[2:42:00] <+Lifes_A_Lich> gotta admire the spirit
[2:42:05] <mortelkilll> i feel like we may be thinking abotu the force mroe than nayone who ever written one of the movie
[2:42:08] <%CommanderSqueaks> @TheDastardlyD If you want to play Kotor 2, get the PC version so you can download the unofficial patches that brought back cut content and fixed the stupid bugs.
[2:42:14] <TheDastardlyD> My computer didn't like it and it always ran weird
[2:42:16] <+blackwolf828> Bendu is in rebels, so its cannon
[2:42:17] <mortelkilll> because the movie just treat the dark side as evil and light side as good
[2:42:30] <jiin6> Rebels was a mistake
[2:42:32] <TheDastardlyD> That's probably going to fix it thanks @CommanderSqueaks
[2:42:41] <mortelkilll> rebels was ok fro mwhat ive seen
[2:42:46] <mortelkilll> my brother liked it
[2:42:48] <SuperVaderMan> Kotor 1 is good for a generally good star wars experience, kotor 2 is good if you want a solid deconstruction of star wars
[2:42:50] <tiger_guard> parry timing is also dependent on difficulty..I like that they show you on the selection screen
[2:42:52] <+blackwolf828> I enjoyed rebels
[2:43:11] <jiin6> time travel is just no
[2:43:16] <MrDante7> kreia is what luke should have been in TLJ
[2:43:25] <Tiny_Axolotl> they're unusually confident
[2:43:29] <%CommanderSqueaks> I mean, the Bad/Good Light/Dark was fine in the original trilogy, because Star Wars wasn't trying to be anything more than a hero's journey fantasy story in space. It was stupid simple, but it was fine.
[2:43:50] <mortelkilll> thign is star wars never evolved past that in the other movies
[2:44:04] <thecrazyanbu> The stormtroopers just went through a confidence building seminar
[2:44:05] <%CommanderSqueaks> Well they tried and they made it worse.
[2:44:21] <gl0vesup7> Say what you will, Ashoka is best waifu
[2:44:28] <MrDante7> isnt that what we all are right here right now
[2:44:32] <+Burger_Bonanza> Kreia wanted to appear 'neutral' but extremely wasn't, yeah
[2:44:44] <%CommanderSqueaks> Like Luke is still the coolest Jedi, he has all the good, benevolent aspects, but he was actually a human being and had wants and goals and failings and shit. Fite me.
[2:44:46] <gl0vesup7> Ahsoka*
[2:44:54] <+Lifes_A_Lich> Ahsoka is pretty cool
[2:44:59] <yoruichi12345> Mara Jade was just a Force sensitive Assassin and that seemed to work well
[2:45:17] <mortelkilll> id get a behidn a star wars vilain that want to destroy the force
[2:45:25] <%CommanderSqueaks> @mortelkilll Play Kotor 2.
[2:45:30] <MrDante7> go play kotor 2
[2:45:42] <gl0vesup7> Like was the coolest Jedi because he actually had a character arc
[2:45:46] <mortelkilll> i might look that up
[2:45:48] <gl0vesup7> Luke*
[2:46:08] <%CommanderSqueaks> @gl0vesup7 In the novels, he also got rid of that "Jedi can't be in romantic relationships' rule.
[2:46:19] <jiin6> i miss kyle
[2:46:49] <yoruichi12345> @CommanderSqueaks GOOD. George Lucas hated Mara Jade because of that whole "the Jedi can't get married rule" lucas was so hung up on
[2:46:53] <gl0vesup7> @commandersqueaks woah thats cool
[2:46:56] <fusedforms> Death wants to know why you never return her texts
[2:47:06] <+crowmium> the good writers in the EU wrote interesting Jedi. any zahn book, for instance
[2:47:07] <thecrazyanbu> Turns out that the jedi mixed up celebrate and celibate
[2:47:08] <yoruichi12345> really goes to show how George was extremely petty at times
[2:47:08] <Artista_AF> actually im surprised that isn't more of a thing, where you can just use Mind tricks to go "dude i just beat the shit outta your boss, get the fuck out"
[2:47:23] <%CommanderSqueaks> @yoruichi12345 To be fair, it's probably cause when George tries to write romance it's the most painful, awkward bullshit ever.
[2:47:32] <mortelkilll> are mind tricks mind controlled or does the idea need to already be in the person mind?
[2:47:45] <+blackwolf828> mind control i think
[2:47:47] <Heyestus> Do you think this game has a dismemberment switch like Jedi Knight 2 did? It feels like a lot of the finishers originally had arms flying off and whatnot.
[2:47:48] <MrDante7> they also make it harder because like, unblockables track really hard so you can't slow them down and sidestep
[2:47:57] <yoruichi12345> @CommanderSqueaks No that was BEFORE the prequels. He hated Mara Jade because Zahn wanted her in a relationship with Luke
[2:48:04] <gl0vesup7> Anakin is a close second for best Jedi, but he’s too edgelord
[2:48:12] <ziggyjesus> All this blocking reminds me of witcher 3 where enemies always block after your third attack. That led to me spamming Rend because it is fast and goes through their blocks
[2:48:26] <mortelkilll> i remember i nthe shwo spider rider there was this move which could kill an opponent will to fight but that move only worked if the character did not have personal motives to do it
[2:48:31] <mortelkilll> basiquelyl onyl work on goons
[2:48:31] <Puhff> That could be argued to be Cal's style. I remember certain saber styles are more defense focused
[2:48:38] <SuperVaderMan> Mind tricks done well is written as a trick of perception or desire. Written poorly it's basically mind control
[2:48:44] <Puhff> Like Obi Wan
[2:49:11] <%CommanderSqueaks> It's basically making whatever you say sound like a good idea to whomever you're controlling, it's more Mind Influence than Mind Control.
[2:49:42] <jiin6> BD likes destruction waaay to much...i like him too
[2:49:50] <tonynony41> Ello
[2:49:51] <mortelkilll> i could imagine "these arent the droids you are looking for" working because the stormtroopers are lazy and dont want to deal wit hthat shit
[2:49:55] <@Nightbot> @Pomer -> Are you finished? [stop spamming symbols] [warning]
[2:49:58] <mortelkilll> so easy to influence into not doing their job
[2:50:02] <zenith0111> Inception rmzSLAIN
[2:50:18] <+blackwolf828> I do find it kind of weird that a jedi padawan can use single, double bladed and dual wielding styles fairly easily
[2:50:20] <tonynony41> thatdeCHEEKS thatdeCHEEKS thatdeCHEEKS
[2:50:24] <jiin6> the desert must have been killer in that armor
[2:50:27] <%CommanderSqueaks> I like to imagine the reason it worked so easily on the guards is because they've probably been sweating their balls off in the sun all day and just wanted their shift to end, so it was easy to convince them to let them pass so they wouldn't have to bother.
[2:50:31] <+Lifes_A_Lich> Oh believe me there is that in this lol
[2:50:36] <gl0vesup7> @pomer Thicc
[2:50:37] <+gralho> Do you like apples, chat?
[2:50:39] <+dawsfloss> does Plague vidya game?
[2:50:57] <yoruichi12345> People tend to forget about the Fair part of "Tough but Fair"
[2:50:59] <tonynony41> Na get gud
[2:51:07] <Heyestus> Dominant strategy is a bad time.
[2:51:13] <$SilverRoddo> Apple bottoms, yes.
[2:51:21] <Puhff> I wonder how much Sekiro was on the devs mind
[2:51:27] <Puhff> apatDab
[2:51:36] <%CommanderSqueaks> @Puhff It was definitely on the producer's mind after Sekiro came out.
[2:51:40] <arkv01> parrydise
[2:52:04] <gl0vesup7> That’s why ds2 is the hardest souls game
[2:52:26] <mortelkilll> if its too easy you dont want to lear nthe game trough
[2:52:50] <sosuke5> but big number though
[2:52:55] <%CommanderSqueaks> No do combo
[2:52:56] <mortelkilll> need to be a certai nsense of challenge , but you need to have options so not too challenging
[2:53:10] <arkv01> "I think I'm clocking out for the day"
[2:53:11] <yoruichi12345> That sounds like another "Linear bad gaem, Open World Gud Gaem" logic that I don't like
[2:53:13] <%CommanderSqueaks> Isn't that why games have difficulty options though?
[2:53:16] <mortelkilll> if somethign to oeasy you can fall into the same issue for different reasons, alway doign the same thing
[2:53:16] <arkv01> as he proceeds to end himself
[2:53:30] <+Lifes_A_Lich> Metal gear rising deflecting
[2:53:32] <+crowmium> sure is nice of them to make their grenades glow like that
[2:53:35] <jiin6> Running around like a crazy Raver
[2:53:38] <TheDastardlyD> It looks like he's even covering his eyes when he runs
[2:53:52] <%CommanderSqueaks> All of these dudes should just pick up flamethrowers, can't deflect that shit with your beam sword.
[2:53:57] <Puhff> Doodnium
[2:54:08] <zenith0111> Sure is convenient that lasers aren't faster than a lightsaber cantaEZ
[2:54:34] <tiger_guard> hey if anyone can use lightsabers then why don't stormtroopers use lightsabers?
[2:54:39] <jiin6> sowing dem seeds baby
[2:54:46] <MrDante7> too expensive to mass produce
[2:54:46] <Puhff> Reeeeally wish saber modding wasnt just cosmetic
[2:54:47] <mortelkilll> lightsabers arent that good zenith
[2:54:48] <arkv01> into dead clone trooper bodies?
[2:54:49] <%CommanderSqueaks> @zenith0111 I always head-canoned that the lasers actually are fast, but you're seeing Jedi slow-down perception time bullshit so they aren't just moving like DBZ characters.
[2:55:00] <MrDante7> they also aren't lasers
[2:55:00] <gl0vesup7> @tiger_guard isn’t it expensive or sumn?
[2:55:02] <MrDante7> they're plasma
[2:55:02] <+crowmium> @tiger_guard can't mass produce them I would guess
[2:55:13] <jiin6> saber dat big booty
[2:55:14] <arkv01> wow what a cutie
[2:55:23] <arkv01> I bet that booty has ALL her kids
[2:55:33] <mortelkilll> people dont use lightsabers for the same reasons we dont use swords
[2:55:35] <$SilverRoddo> Spider-bae.
[2:55:43] <%CommanderSqueaks> I'm still hung up on the fact that Flamethrowers completely circumvent all of the problems with using guns against a Jedi.
[2:55:45] <mortelkilll> jedi can do tricks wit hthem trough
[2:55:55] <mortelkilll> still i feel a jedi would do the same tricks wit ha gun fine
[2:55:58] <+Lifes_A_Lich> Most swords cant deflect guns though
[2:56:03] <gl0vesup7> Don’t lewd the arachnid
[2:56:09] <arkv01> gararrahahg
[2:56:12] <jiin6> pile of junk
[2:56:13] <%CommanderSqueaks> @Lifes_A_Lich Most swords also can't cut through bulkhead.
[2:56:13] <mortelkilll> pistol and saber combo maybe would work best
[2:56:15] <zenith0111> @commandersqueaks Oh rmzSLAIN
[2:56:22] <+blackwolf828> I mean, force users have been shown to push or hold back the fire of flamethrowers, thats why mandalorians can't insta kill them with it
[2:56:29] <arkv01> the butt jiggle physics in this game puts porn games to shame
[2:56:30] <%Samex_Comex> They love it
[2:56:33] <jiin6> SCAN THE OPRHENS
[2:56:39] <TheDastardlyD> 1000 cute eggs
[2:56:41] <jiin6> orpans
[2:56:46] <MrDante7> @CommanderSqueaks bullets would also work better than blasters
[2:57:03] <+crowmium> there are instances of Jedi using their powers when firing blasters and other weapons besides
[2:57:17] <%CommanderSqueaks> @MrDante7 I think one of the benefits of the laser rifles is you don't need magazines. Not having to reload IS a MASSIVE benefit to not using bullets.
[2:57:19] <+Lifes_A_Lich> I would think a jedi could slow bullets or just stop them with the force though
[2:57:22] <HiddenPorpoise> Jedi Thermobarics
[2:57:33] <+blackwolf828> Jedi can just slow/stop blaster bolts
[2:57:51] <zenith0111> LUL
[2:57:54] <SuperVaderMan> Who's talking?
[2:57:57] <TheDastardlyD> The mythical monster of aaaaahhhh
[2:57:58] <+Lifes_A_Lich> Sith just catch them in their hands even
[2:58:00] <SuperVaderMan> Who said that?
[2:58:05] <+Lifes_A_Lich> of absorb them
[2:58:11] <jiin6> yep
[2:58:28] <MrDante7> @CommanderSqueaks fair, that you basically have 100 shots before having to reload
[2:58:28] <$SilverRoddo> No Charles, get outta my head.
[2:58:40] <+blackwolf828> Hell, force users can even act as a barrier/stop lightsaber blades if they get close enough
[2:58:57] <jiin6> stop laying eggs into my brain charles
[2:59:10] <TheDastardlyD> Dump that barrel of extremely toxic waste into the water
[2:59:10] <%CommanderSqueaks> @MrDante7 I've also never seen a blaster jam or misfire, ANOTHER massive benefit.
[2:59:20] <+Lifes_A_Lich> No sploosh
[2:59:22] <jiin6> into the pumpkin soup
[2:59:31] <gl0vesup7> Into the void it goes
[2:59:34] <zenith0111> Do you splash?
[2:59:40] <TheDastardlyD> Thhis is my favorite entry
[2:59:50] <jiin6> SAP
[2:59:52] <+blackwolf828> Very explosive sap
[3:00:02] <%CommanderSqueaks> It's Wookie Lube.
[3:00:03] <arkv01> baby yodas explosive tree sap
[3:00:06] <zenith0111> Omg he doesn't splash
[3:00:07] <jiin6> Emperor needs his pancakes
[3:00:16] <$SilverRoddo> What, stasis.
[3:00:18] <%Samex_Comex> More like Fallen odor
[3:00:20] <MainMan_Jonadiah> I clapped when he said the thing
[3:00:27] <TheDastardlyD> That entry actually says that there is like 1000 tons of extremely toxic waste for every barrel of sap
[3:00:43] <jiin6> highlight of there day
[3:00:47] <%CommanderSqueaks> @TheDastardlyD So this is a Captain Planet episode now, too?
[3:00:51] <arkv01> as you smash their heads together
[3:01:13] <TheDastardlyD> Yeah sith bad, pollution bad, sith = pollution
[3:01:20] <+crowmium> the lack of stealth in this game is the most disappointing thing for me
[3:01:21] <+Lifes_A_Lich> The Jedi cheated >:(
[3:01:29] <arkv01> I feel like there is unwarranted racism against the sith
[3:01:34] <arkv01> jedi propaganda
[3:01:51] <jiin6> Jedi are big racists who hate the color red
[3:01:54] <+blackwolf828> I mean, yea probably back when the sith were just red people
[3:02:27] <gl0vesup7> I would’ve been happy if this game had more cool force power bs
[3:02:31] <MrDante7> oh man, that was a bad one
[3:02:39] <%CommanderSqueaks> Wait, can Plague not grab anything while dialogue is playing? I just realized this.
[3:02:49] <zenith0111> WTF
[3:03:00] <gl0vesup7> But apparently electrocuting your enemies is “too much”
[3:03:18] <yoruichi12345> nah, the platforming it bad
[3:03:20] <$SilverRoddo> Christian Bale might make a good Jedi man.
[3:03:23] <+blackwolf828> Its a sith power, thats why
[3:03:57] <MainMan_Jonadiah> "We'll win easy" he says as 4 of his friends were killed very easily
[3:03:58] <gl0vesup7> @blackwolf828 yea I know, I was mocking the Jedi
[3:04:02] <jiin6> look at all these clones of Yuri lowenthal
[3:04:10] <Tiny_Axolotl> whats wrong with these storm troopers
[3:04:16] <TheDastardlyD> force push totally works with ledges
[3:04:17] <%CommanderSqueaks> @gl0vesup7 To be fair, Jedi never use powers that are directly lethal. Force push won't kill anyone, it's the soldier's fault for standing near a bottomess pit.
[3:04:21] <TheDastardlyD> later
[3:04:25] <+Lifes_A_Lich> omg
[3:04:25] <zenith0111> YEET
[3:04:27] <%Samex_Comex> Weeee
[3:04:36] <MrDante7> i honestly didn't think the game would let you do that
[3:04:37] <jiin6> nice
[3:04:44] <+Lifes_A_Lich> he tried to stop himself from getting pushed too
[3:04:47] <TheDastardlyD> The only ones you can't push off are bosses iirc
[3:05:08] <+Burger_Bonanza> I started that fight by sprinting up and pushing the bossman off before he even turned around. Extremely satisfying
[3:05:12] <gl0vesup7> @commandersqueaks yea, Jedi are dummos
[3:05:21] <jiin6> Pull! shakes fists
[3:05:23] <%CommanderSqueaks> @TheDastardlyD You know... it'd be less dumb if they just had boss fights in areas without cliffs to push them off of, but fair.
[3:05:38] <MrDante7> this is the wookie orgy hallway
[3:05:54] <%Samex_Comex> Free the Wookie's!
[3:05:55] <zenith0111> Oh boy you're going to be in for a treat LUL
[3:05:55] <jiin6> come on shaved wookies
[3:06:04] <jiin6> DAMIT
[3:06:06] <+blackwolf828> Maybe just as a rule of thumb, don't fight force users by cliffs and shit
[3:06:15] <%Rezca> what happened to his face?
[3:06:19] <arkv01> unacceptable, I need my ps2 wookies
[3:06:29] <Sokumotanaka> OH SHIT THAT ROBOT IS TOUGH
[3:06:29] <zenith0111> You have to see the full body LUL
[3:06:35] <jiin6> its robot alan tudyk runnn
[3:06:43] <MainMan_Jonadiah> Yo, this robot doing Urien tackles is pretty sick though
[3:06:44] <ziggyjesus> Remember Rogue One Robot????
[3:06:48] <thecrazyanbu> He was the best character in Rogue One
[3:06:55] <%CommanderSqueaks> @gl0vesup7 Dumb lore shit also says that you HAVE to use hate to summon force lightning or some shit. Which is kind of the antithesis of what the Jedi are about.
[3:06:58] <arkv01> this bot bout to throw out an aegis reflector
[3:07:02] <zenith0111> I forgot I watched Rogue One
[3:07:16] <jiin6> Rogue one was a thing?
[3:07:24] <gl0vesup7> @commandersqueaks lul
[3:07:34] <arkv01> they look BEAUTIFUL
[3:07:40] <gl0vesup7> OOF
[3:07:41] <+Burger_Bonanza> loving these "really good for a ps3" wookiees
[3:07:46] <gl0vesup7> YIKES
[3:07:48] <ziggyjesus> My EYES
[3:07:48] <Tiny_Axolotl> ewwwwwww
[3:07:48] <zenith0111> LUL
[3:07:48] <jiin6> Oh there breath is the worst
[3:07:53] <arkv01> theiy're SO GOOD
[3:07:54] <%Rezca> were they being starved?
[3:07:54] <SuperVaderMan> I hope their bomb collars don't explode all of their gross heads off

[3:08:08] <Ynkubus18> They're a bunch of wookie/grouch hynrids
[3:08:13] <zenith0111> INTERACT WITH THEM THO
[3:08:15] <$SilverRoddo> Don’t look!
[3:08:16] <gl0vesup7> 🤮
[3:08:25] <yoruichi12345> wut
[3:08:26] <jiin6> PICTURE BAD ARRRR
[3:08:27] <Tempmael> dammit i cant read
[3:08:27] <%Samex_Comex> He's helping
[3:08:29] <AllJoeShow> high quality planning
[3:08:38] <arkv01> the ancient enemy butthole
[3:08:50] <mortelkilll> wow, these models are bad
[3:08:51] <zenith0111> They look like a mash of fur textures and no model LUL
[3:08:55] <gl0vesup7> I hate how they look so much
[3:08:57] <arkv01> no zoom allowed LUL
[3:08:58] <SuperVaderMan> oh no, wookiee feet
[3:09:00] <iwasJase> why does that wookie look like a wet hairy hotdog
[3:09:02] <MainMan_Jonadiah> Ah yes, the old Wookie saying: "*herk*"
[3:09:03] <Tempmael> look at their gross feet
[3:09:11] <%Samex_Comex> They are so lanky
[3:09:13] <+Burger_Bonanza> hate wall!
[3:09:15] <%CommanderSqueaks> @gl0vesup7 It's like that Jedi fightning style that Mace Windu uses, Jedi are super sketch about it cause it requires you to be in a super amped, passionate state, and you can really easily fall into the Dark Side. Windu could do it cause Samuel L Jackson is a unit.
[3:09:18] <jiin6> to think lumpy exists
[3:09:20] <$SilverRoddo> They look they crisis movie Sonic.
[3:09:22] <Artista_AF> this is the saddest looking Please Kill Me Wookie i have ever seen, i love it LUL
[3:09:37] <%CommanderSqueaks> Also you can't have Samuel L Jackson and NOT have him be amped.
[3:09:39] <arkv01> wookies always forced to sit at the back of the ship
[3:09:44] <Artista_AF> Paramount's Sonic the Wookie
[3:09:56] <gl0vesup7> @commandersqueaks Samuel Jackson is always a mad lad
[3:10:09] <iwasJase> LULW
[3:10:11] <arkv01> LUL
[3:10:15] <AllJoeShow> not even a death howl?
[3:10:17] <+Lifes_A_Lich> Become one with the soup
[3:10:23] <yoruichi12345> yes
[3:10:23] <arkv01> you aren't tapping into the force
[3:10:30] <zenith0111> That's how physics works cantaHehe
[3:10:31] <arkv01> you must believe
[3:10:39] <MainMan_Jonadiah> It was the force
[3:10:39] <Tempmael> lmao
[3:10:41] <iwasJase> but Plague, you're not using the force enough
[3:10:42] <arkv01> you BELIEVED POGGERS
[3:10:51] <gl0vesup7> Look at it phasing through his dick
[3:10:59] <jiin6> it snapped you to plave
[3:11:05] <jiin6> place*
[3:11:06] <arkv01> yeh boi we're augmenting you a new SFM processing unit
[3:11:10] <zenith0111> What I never understood is why can't they use the force to fly?
[3:11:15] <%CommanderSqueaks> With the force, how is this redheaded chode every bumbling and missing a ledge? Why doesn't he just use the force to give him a little boost if he's short on his jump or whatever the fuck?
[3:11:24] <iwasJase> aka the sex droids
[3:11:40] <arkv01> @zenith0111 yoda pretty much does but it consumes too must concentration to hover all the time
[3:11:54] <MainMan_Jonadiah> Yoda doesn't fly, he just jump good
[3:11:57] <arkv01> they can launch themselves real good though
[3:12:05] <%CommanderSqueaks> @MainMan_Jonadiah I got that reference.
[3:12:09] <yoruichi12345> It was Doonium
[3:12:13] <yoruichi12345> that was the new thing
[3:12:22] <MainMan_Jonadiah> Thank you, I was waiting to use it
[3:12:36] <iwasJase> jedi bonfire!
[3:12:58] <MainMan_Jonadiah> Guy's super amped for the ambush
[3:13:02] <bucketofdan> Hey. Consuming Product? How is latest product?
[3:13:07] <zenith0111> For the Jedi Order rmzDEVIL
[3:13:12] <jiin6> Murder them all - jedi master approved tactic
[3:13:28] <A_High_Ordinator> *Lightside points gained*
[3:13:44] <%CommanderSqueaks> God I can see the Mobs being pulled like this is a fucking WoW dungeon
[3:13:57] <$SilverRoddo> TR8R?
[3:14:09] <jiin6> genocide against the wookies... *light side points added*
[3:14:10] <ziggyjesus> Can you just keep spamming that dash move to drain their stamina?
[3:14:35] <gl0vesup7> “Peace was never an option”
[3:14:37] <TheDastardlyD> It does
[3:14:41] <TheDastardlyD> I hate it
[3:14:47] <MrDante7> its good against heavy blaster fire because it just keeps deflecting
[3:14:51] <$SilverRoddo> You can’t be murderer if they ain’t born.
[3:15:02] <jiin6> seems like the fast style
[3:15:29] <MrDante7> double bladed does half damage i think
[3:15:32] <gl0vesup7> God but why did they have to look like gremlins tho?? DansGame
[3:15:33] <%CommanderSqueaks> Like, I feel like they really missed out on the fact that this guy is an untrained Jedi APPRENTICE. Like, there's no growth, character failings, stumbling over his own ass, etc.
[3:15:41] <%CommanderSqueaks> **not untrained, incompletely trained
[3:16:29] <zenith0111> 👍
[3:16:32] <gl0vesup7> I like how he’s a bumbling idiot tho
[3:16:33] <%CommanderSqueaks> ... Plague okay that was all you.
[3:16:33] <jiin6> SAAAAAP
[3:16:43] <TheDastardlyD> You can't get that yet don't kill yourself like I did
[3:16:45] <iwasJase> wow.
[3:16:46] <yoruichi12345> DAMN IT
[3:16:48] <MrDante7> you can get it, its just a puzzle
[3:16:50] <+Lifes_A_Lich> We all join the soup sooner or later
[3:17:01] <+crowmium> does he not have double jump?
[3:17:06] <%CommanderSqueaks> You dry hump that computer, droid.
[3:17:06] <MrDante7> or yeah you need double jump nvm
[3:17:14] <gl0vesup7> @crowmium nope
[3:17:42] <$SilverRoddo> Don’t worry Force Float, glide, teleport? will be attainable.
[3:17:45] <zenith0111> Why do you have a baby jump? Sam from Death Stranding has a better jump
[3:17:48] <MrDante7> oh boy
[3:17:50] <arkv01> some assembly required
[3:17:51] <%CommanderSqueaks> Wait what.
[3:17:52] <MrDante7> you guys like that
[3:17:53] <TheDastardlyD> What
[3:17:54] <zenith0111> OMG
[3:17:55] <%CommanderSqueaks> Did he just die?
[3:17:55] <%Samex_Comex> What
[3:17:57] <arkv01> I mean thats fair
[3:17:58] <MrDante7> another really dumb thing just happened
[3:17:59] <gl0vesup7> If you need double jump for that, that’s actual bad game design
[3:18:00] <MrDante7> @CommanderSqueaks yes
[3:18:01] <$thomassolorio> SwiftRage100 yes yes the time for Darth plagues to arise has arived
[3:18:03] <SuperVaderMan> Oh no, a slowly rotating platform, my only weakness
[3:18:06] <+Lifes_A_Lich> legs broken
[3:18:11] <MrDante7> You are not allowed to stand on the platform when it moves
[3:18:12] <%CommanderSqueaks> @MrDante7 That was amazing.
[3:18:15] <arkv01> time it rllly good
[3:18:26] <%Samex_Comex> :(
[3:18:29] <Uncle_Wizard> I love this part
[3:18:32] <jiin6> Slow spining, who would think of such trick?
[3:18:42] <lewdnekojam> you must unboomer your mind jedi
[3:18:50] <arkv01> becoom
[3:18:51] <cerazor01> LUL plague cmon
[3:18:52] <MrDante7> you can get to that platform from the other side @PlagueOfGripes
[3:19:02] <zenith0111> 4Head
[3:19:08] <%CommanderSqueaks> Is Plague at a dead end or is he obsessing over the chest? I was looking away.
[3:19:18] <arkv01> when the force helps you coom Kreygasm
[3:19:24] <jiin6> THE SLIPPERY SAAAP
[3:19:31] <gl0vesup7> @commandersqueaks both
[3:19:33] <zenith0111> No the chest tho
[3:19:37] <thomassolorio> lol
[3:19:53] <TheDastardlyD> "Living hurts"
[3:20:03] <gl0vesup7> “KILL ME”
[3:20:04] <jiin6> "they keep giving us baths HELP" - wookie
[3:20:07] <$SilverRoddo> Solving the problem 🎶
[3:20:28] <%CommanderSqueaks> They spent ALL that money on this dude's hair texture, but they decided to spend exactly a dollar on the race that's ALL fur.
[3:20:32] <jiin6> mr whitticker
[3:20:40] <gl0vesup7> Let me iiin
[3:20:47] <@Nightbot> Plague is a youtube animator and also streams at https://picarto.tv/Plague . Also: t-shirts! http://goo.gl/lze8QO
[3:20:47] <A_High_Ordinator> They're in cutscene mode
[3:20:48] <arkv01> to be fair these wookies live up to expectations
[3:20:55] <arkv01> low poly is the only quality they deserve
[3:20:57] <%CommanderSqueaks> "Forest, forest. Oh god, he has his earbuds in."
[3:21:05] <+MurlinDurl> their fighting a force field deflecting their shots back at them Kappa
[3:21:12] <conflict1914> hows this game so far? i've heard decent things
[3:21:15] <thomassolorio> ya hack the planet
[3:21:23] <implied_consent> Benor
[3:21:25] <%CommanderSqueaks> @MurlinDurl That's literally what all these Storm Troopers are doing against the MC, so whatcha gonna do?
[3:21:28] <gl0vesup7> Droid is not impressed
[3:21:30] <jiin6> incompentant...aw...
[3:21:38] <Tempmael> how rude
[3:21:41] <arkv01> are droids always this snarky
[3:21:50] <arkv01> or is this a symptom of new star wars writers
[3:21:52] <thomassolorio> ya fuck it up
[3:21:54] <zenith0111> That spots too strong
[3:21:57] <mistkommree> fight the damn droid
[3:21:59] <TheDastardlyD> Oh you can you just need a slidy slope trust me
[3:22:15] <thomassolorio> ouuu robo bitch slap
[3:22:24] <+MurlinDurl> frend
[3:22:34] <%CommanderSqueaks> Storm Trooper trained specifically to fight Jedi: Chode. Random droid throwing clumsy haymakers: A problem.
[3:22:44] <jiin6> you hacked the robot into depression
[3:22:58] <arkv01> holy shit these are some emaciated wookies
[3:23:03] <implied_consent> Yo plague I looked you up on exhentai and you don't really draw any hardcore shit. Not sure how to feel. Glad, si guess.
[3:23:10] <%Samex_Comex> God their arms
[3:23:11] <Uncle_Wizard> why did you fee them?!
[3:23:27] <TheDastardlyD> They don't fight back if you hack them
[3:23:28] <zenith0111> Wookies don't bathe but they never look that bad
[3:23:32] <+Krystalsky> hacking make them fight for u
[3:23:32] <TheDastardlyD> So you can murder freely
[3:23:42] <TheDastardlyD> Also they fight for you
[3:23:49] <thomassolorio> to make him realize the fragility of his own existence
[3:23:50] <+Krystalsky> u can also freely kill them and get their xp still
[3:23:51] <%CommanderSqueaks> I want the scene after to be with amazing Wookie textures and you find out that they were severely starved and sickly before, which is why they looked like hot dog shit.
[3:23:56] <+crowmium> maybe they fight if other enemies are still alive?
[3:23:57] <arkv01> you need a foam roller plague
[3:24:12] <gl0vesup7> Get that gamer hunchback plague
[3:24:29] <$SilverRoddo> That droid learned the values of shame, and is lamenting his involvement in this war.
[3:24:48] <arkv01> guess we marry the daughters of these freed wookies and become a king
[3:24:55] <zenith0111> Defective Machine MrDestructoid
[3:25:15] <zenith0111> Why are we all programed with emotions? MrDestructoid
[3:25:16] <gl0vesup7> Uriel droid has had enough
[3:25:27] <gl0vesup7> Urien*
[3:25:34] <TheDastardlyD> When it repaired itself it repaired its brain too
[3:25:39] <%Rezca> The true jedi way
[3:25:39] <arkv01> oh no sugoiAwawa
[3:25:52] <+Lifes_A_Lich> It probably does more in places that are more open
[3:25:52] <TheDastardlyD> They also fight for you
[3:26:00] <cerazor01> Can CAL not swim?
[3:26:18] <arkv01> I'm afraid I can't let you swim CAL
[3:26:21] <jiin6> i miss the gaudy yellow
[3:26:28] <zenith0111> Or like a slightly brighter pipe
[3:26:33] <+Lifes_A_Lich> D:
[3:26:34] <+MurlinDurl> LUL
[3:26:37] <gl0vesup7> Yea let me get this Suck Energy
[3:26:38] <ziggyjesus> Aggghhhh
[3:26:42] <%Rezca> What kind of lesson was this
[3:26:45] <jiin6> mr whittker got him
[3:26:45] <lilmac64> Stromtrooper Merced. More at 11.
[3:26:55] <yoruichi12345> can you jump down to get that one box?
[3:27:02] <ThereIsNoJustice> yeah that was how you get that box
[3:27:02] <+MurlinDurl> D:
[3:27:03] <zenith0111> rmzGASM Oh no what a way to go
[3:27:08] <+crowmium> noooo the chest...
[3:27:10] <+Krystalsky> @yoruichi12345 u cant get back then
[3:27:18] <yoruichi12345> okay
[3:27:22] <+Krystalsky> cal
[3:27:23] <$SilverRoddo> bitterGasm bitterGasm
[3:27:23] <jiin6> ginger?
[3:27:23] <gl0vesup7> That’s a deviantart waiting to happen
[3:27:24] <arkv01> wookies are known to be the fiercest lovers in the known reaches
[3:27:24] <MrDante7> cal kestis
[3:27:31] <+MurlinDurl> cal koopy
[3:27:41] <DrunkUnclePete> Bal Testis
[3:27:43] <TheDastardlyD> King Koopa
[3:27:49] <+BaronVonThule> Kal Cestis
[3:27:51] <gl0vesup7> Calzone
[3:28:02] <DrunkUnclePete> Calorie
[3:28:05] <jiin6> LUL Cal xony
[3:28:19] <TheDastardlyD> Not yet
[3:28:22] <MrDante7> no
[3:28:25] <TheDastardlyD> You nailed it
[3:28:27] <+Krystalsky> cant get it yet
[3:28:32] <yoruichi12345> II was saying that when you were at the top floor
[3:28:49] <$SilverRoddo> You need Jump Force. Kappa
[3:28:51] <+crowmium> from above it looked like you could
[3:29:03] <conflict1914> this seems really stiff for platforming challenges
[3:29:04] <+Krystalsky> @crowmium he cant jump back then after
[3:29:04] <MrDante7> yes
[3:29:19] <MrDante7> 4 powers, congrats
[3:29:28] <A_High_Ordinator> Jedi master
[3:29:29] <DrunkUnclePete> you playing on pc or console?
[3:29:29] <ziggyjesus> Thats disappointing
[3:29:32] <Tiny_Axolotl> How does this compare to force unleashed?
[3:29:36] <gl0vesup7> Jedi SUCC energy
[3:29:51] <+Krystalsky> hes a jedi, jedi get all the shitty powers
[3:30:21] <%Samex_Comex> Poor Conan O'Brien
[3:30:22] <zenith0111> Or freaky aliens
[3:30:25] <LordPubious> The Jedi temple is a McDojo
[3:30:35] <gl0vesup7> @tiny_axolotl less force power, more ginger
[3:30:38] <arkv01> if jedi were allowed to fuck they'd could be so much more powerful
[3:30:51] <ThatOneGuyYouSaw> jedi are allowed to fuck
[3:30:55] <jiin6> hahah nice
[3:30:56] <%CommanderSqueaks> @Krystalsky I mean Force Unleashed showed you just how fun Force Push could actually be. It's all about how you implement it.
[3:31:02] <ThatOneGuyYouSaw> they just can't fall in love
[3:31:10] <Sokumotanaka> XD
[3:31:13] <%Samex_Comex> Ew the smell of burning hair
[3:31:31] <$SilverRoddo> OhMyDog he IS Coco.
[3:31:36] <+Krystalsky> @CommanderSqueaks never played much of them, played more kotor where force lightning is king
[3:31:41] <TheDastardlyD> That's the command grab robot
[3:31:47] <zenith0111> He seems more like a nuisance
[3:31:47] <cerazor01> DID THAT ROBOT CALL YOU A PISSANT?
[3:31:57] <Sokumotanaka> I thought wookies were suppose to be tough, like krogan tough
[3:32:18] <arkv01> if we don't defeat this jedi he will brainwash us into raising our wive's children
[3:32:18] <+BaronVonThule> Wookies don't have 4 balls
[3:32:24] <%CommanderSqueaks> ^
[3:32:47] <%CommanderSqueaks> Yeyeyeye
[3:32:49] <%Rezca> are they... ok?
[3:32:51] <zenith0111> Game is a little dumb
[3:32:51] <HiddenPorpoise> Everytime I see that droid I expect it to scream "Become as gods"
[3:32:52] <lewdnekojam> truely the star wars way
[3:32:54] <gl0vesup7> Pilot fell asleep at the wheel
[3:33:01] <%CommanderSqueaks> Oh, Gameplay can start again.
[3:33:04] <jiin6> now the chicken walker got sad
[3:33:05] <TheDastardlyD> That AT-ST stepped off the edge when it fought me and got stuck in place
[3:33:08] <MrDante7> i love broken AI
[3:33:12] <Sokumotanaka> It's just standing there...menacingly
[3:33:15] <+BaronVonThule> The driver had to take a phone cacll
[3:33:15] <zenith0111> It's so hard to find good AI...
[3:33:57] <%CommanderSqueaks> I just realized, the shitty powers would be acceptable if the other characters and Cal talked about how shitty they are. Forest goes "Wait, that's all you can do?" and Cal just sheepishly goes "Yeah.. kinda."
[3:34:02] <gl0vesup7> God, I wish the droid was t-posing in place
[3:34:24] <jiin6> ew THEY NEED BATHS
[3:34:25] <+Lifes_A_Lich> they fell in the goop
[3:34:25] <MrDante7> they grew mold in prison
[3:34:25] <arkv01> threes a crowd
[3:34:28] <BlueLunecy> The legs are too gangly
[3:34:29] <gl0vesup7> MAXIMUM SWAMP ASS
[3:34:29] <+BaronVonThule> Pollen
[3:34:33] <%Samex_Comex> Woolie's
[3:34:35] <filthypally> fuck the greenies
[3:34:40] <jiin6> woolies people
[3:34:44] <InsanityMethods> This game did another month or so to refine the animation.
[3:34:44] <conflict1914> why are they only just realising you're a jedi
[3:34:48] <TheDastardlyD> How EMPOWERING
[3:34:55] <zenith0111> @jiin6 They never bathe and take it as a personal offense when others don't like their smell
[3:34:57] <TheDastardlyD> It makes me want to clap furiously
[3:35:05] <%CommanderSqueaks> "For the cause". That's a lukewarm as shit motto.
[3:35:07] <%Samex_Comex> Who's the blue man
[3:35:09] <Uncle_Wizard> we live to loose another day
[3:35:18] <$doomp12> is that Kanye?
[3:35:21] <$SilverRoddo> Ya! bitterHype
[3:35:24] <arkv01> he's feeling his dick grow bigger now
[3:35:24] <ziggyjesus> Why does Cal or the crew even care? They have no skin in the game
[3:35:27] <MrDante7> i have no idea what his motivation is
[3:35:48] <lewdnekojam> thats actually the jedi way holochrons and what not
[3:35:49] <gl0vesup7> “END MY SUFFERING”
[3:35:54] <arkv01> well now that you know his name, you have to shake his hand
[3:35:55] <+Lifes_A_Lich> his journey is for sea salt ice cream.
[3:36:05] <TheDastardlyD> "I wish I died in that cell"
[3:36:10] <zenith0111> Are ancient Jedi.... Holotext Kappa Like wtf
[3:36:11] <conflict1914> this gameplay is really underwhelming after playing force unleashed recently
[3:36:12] <InsanityMethods> His motivation is to take over Gotham.
[3:36:14] <MrDante7> they come up with a story reason for more empire
[3:36:22] <+crowmium> yeah whoever wrote that scene didn't understand cal's character
[3:36:28] <Sokumotanaka> No such thing as a sexy spider
[3:36:31] <arkv01> thats the breath of fresh air star wars needs, monster girls
[3:36:32] <%CommanderSqueaks> Ugh, why do they have VERY clear toes, I don't like their feet. I just want it to be like fur boot cuts
[3:36:41] <+crowmium> he's too brooding to cheer like that
[3:36:47] <TheDastardlyD> His fur is full of tar
[3:36:53] <+BaronVonThule> How is she getting all that information from just 1 growl
[3:36:53] <gl0vesup7> Why are the wookies built like muppets
[3:36:58] <MrDante7> @CommanderSqueaks they should wear shoes like sonic
[3:37:13] <$doomp12> why are they still wearing those collars?
[3:37:23] <TheDastardlyD> They enjoy subjugation
[3:37:25] <cerazor01> Saul Gerrera is supposed to literally be a Space Taliban.
[3:37:37] <MrDante7> its human hands with bad ghillie suit foliage put over it
[3:37:39] <Sokumotanaka> I thought they were based on Sasquatch
[3:37:41] <%CommanderSqueaks> @doomp12 It's one of the few things that make their design interesting, you shut up.
[3:37:42] <InsanityMethods> Yeah, this game really needed another month in the oven.
[3:37:46] <zenith0111> OMG did they just the normal human model upscale it a bit and shove textures all over it?
[3:37:46] <arkv01> yeah those feet don't look too good
[3:37:51] <lewdnekojam> they are probably not pure breed wookies maybe human mixed
[3:37:52] <conflict1914> nothing to do in prison except nail polishing
[3:38:02] <%CommanderSqueaks> Pedicures ALL DAY
[3:38:04] <lewdnekojam> i bet its han's fault
[3:38:09] <%Samex_Comex> Poor Wookies
[3:38:12] <TheDastardlyD> That one dipped his hand in mustard
[3:38:14] <conflict1914> oh god you're right
[3:38:21] <gl0vesup7> LUL
[3:38:21] <+crowmium> yeah right now
[3:38:30] <Sokumotanaka> Balding human man, talks shit on other races XD
[3:38:33] <TheDastardlyD> The shit that makes marks in your toilet bowl
[3:38:33] <ziggyjesus> no
[3:38:41] <ziggyjesus> i don't know
[3:38:43] <%CommanderSqueaks> Plague is a professor of shit.
[3:38:46] <%CommanderSqueaks> This is not surprising.
[3:38:51] <zenith0111> rmzTHICC rmzTHINK
[3:38:53] <arkv01> "our father was human GERHARHAHHE"
[3:38:58] <emillionghost> i just got here.......
[3:39:03] <+BaronVonThule> Plague has missile shits
[3:39:05] <%CommanderSqueaks> Don't kinkshame the Wookie.
[3:39:25] <gl0vesup7> That wookie on the floor is contemplating his existence
[3:39:40] <%Samex_Comex> Rowwwwr!
[3:39:49] <TheDastardlyD> Hey wookies you can't say the N word on stream
[3:39:56] <Sokumotanaka> "Fucking honkey"
[3:40:09] <+Krystalsky> chat has it ever been explained how jedis alwasy understand droids?
[3:40:18] <zenith0111> "Stupid Humans they'll never see it coming"
[3:40:18] <TheDastardlyD> Ha MURDER amirite guys
[3:40:32] <arkv01> these guys talking about their wookie body counts
[3:40:33] <lewdnekojam> its all one gaint prank
[3:40:36] <Sokumotanaka> Translators for lucus lazy
[3:40:36] <InsanityMethods> It'd seem like learning droid-speak would be mandatory in this universe.
[3:40:49] <lewdnekojam> i bet force just dabs at the end of it and yeets away
[3:40:50] <@Nightbot> Plague is a youtube animator and also streams at https://picarto.tv/Plague . Also: t-shirts! http://goo.gl/lze8QO
[3:40:56] <InsanityMethods> But no, it's never explained.
[3:40:58] <%CommanderSqueaks> @InsanityMethods So would knowing at least a little Wookie, you'd think.
[3:41:01] <gl0vesup7> @krystalsky Jedi are fluent in beep boops
[3:41:14] <Sokumotanaka> Have we EVER seen a cathar in a star wars movie?
[3:41:24] <%CommanderSqueaks> Luke had good motivations.
[3:41:35] <yoruichi12345> Leiia didn't till Empire
[3:42:03] <%Samex_Comex> I hope they get together at the end of the game
[3:42:04] <%CommanderSqueaks> The Jedi can have good motivations when they aren't handled by shit writers.
[3:42:15] <gl0vesup7> That’s a MK fatality
[3:42:37] <%CommanderSqueaks> He's doing his best.
[3:42:43] <%Samex_Comex> Take him with you
[3:42:45] <TheDastardlyD> Don't bully the gonk droid
[3:42:50] <gl0vesup7> “In awe at this lad”
[3:42:50] <+Lifes_A_Lich> aww <3
[3:42:51] <InsanityMethods> @CommanderSqueaks Star Wars characters in general can have good motivations when they aren't handled by shit writers
[3:42:55] <arkv01> its a cutie
[3:42:59] <gl0vesup7> “Absolute unit”
[3:43:01] <Ynkubus18> G O N K~
[3:43:04] <Tiny_Axolotl> saving cost
[3:43:18] <Sokumotanaka> Joseph Bostar?
[3:43:18] <arkv01> is she talking about her wookie husband
[3:43:30] <%CommanderSqueaks> Why are all these fucking tweakers constantly shifting around like that?
[3:43:36] <LordPubious> At least put a drink dispenser on it
[3:43:42] <Sokumotanaka> he found it
[3:43:44] <arkv01> for diversity plague
[3:43:49] <TheDastardlyD> No
[3:43:50] <Sokumotanaka> they do in koltor
[3:43:53] <%CommanderSqueaks> Yes
[3:43:54] <%Samex_Comex> They should have game them all helmets
[3:44:02] <%CommanderSqueaks> Plague, you of all people should know the answer to that question.
[3:44:06] <MrDante7> the fur is the clothes
[3:44:09] <yoruichi12345> maybe it retracts
[3:44:10] <MrDante7> they take off the fur to fuck
[3:44:17] <%CommanderSqueaks> "Can you picture X ban..." Yes, yes I can.
[3:44:21] <InsanityMethods> Best thing about SW: Rebels was making it canon that humans and Twi'lek can fuck and have children.
[3:44:33] <arkv01> twilek are the easiest partners
[3:44:36] <InsanityMethods> Kappa Kappa
[3:44:37] <arkv01> wookies tho
[3:45:33] <%CommanderSqueaks> Like, are they planning on rebuilding the order? What happens once they find these kids? Is Cal going to train them? Where he going to take them?
[3:45:42] <Sokumotanaka> I'd like a Twi'lek and Asari pair of wives
[3:45:57] <%CommanderSqueaks> What's Step 2 after "Find children"?
[3:45:58] <arkv01> probably just to secure their safety cause the empire is still doing their purge
[3:46:25] <InsanityMethods> I'm curious to know how this game ends for Cal seeing as Saw interacts with Kanan and Ezra later on.
[3:46:41] <gl0vesup7> It’s pat
[3:46:48] <InsanityMethods> Twi'lek or Asari is good.
[3:46:49] <ziggyjesus> Kashyyk was pointless, like the casino scene in The Last Jedi
[3:46:54] <%CommanderSqueaks> @arkv01 Isn't there a really really good chance that actively seeking the kids out will tip off the Empire to their location?
[3:46:56] <arkv01> lucas really wanted to fuck aliens
[3:47:10] <InsanityMethods> Quarian though.
[3:47:16] <arkv01> @CommanderSqueaks probably, but not seeking them out is probably a death sentence either way
[3:47:17] <TheDastardlyD> @CommanderSqueaks that's actually addressed later
[3:47:27] <InsanityMethods> I think Lucas seeing Darth Talon awoke something in him.
[3:47:28] <ThereIsNoJustice> there should be a scifi show where it's just a guy trying to bang as many aliens as possible
[3:47:36] <%CommanderSqueaks> @TheDastardlyD Be frank with me, does the plot actually become less of a bumblefuck later?
[3:47:37] <shinichizio> Torchlight?
[3:47:38] <arkv01> @ThereIsNoJustice farscape?
[3:47:44] <InsanityMethods> Then again, there was the characters in RotJ he added.
[3:47:49] <Sokumotanaka> Cathar tho
[3:47:51] <MrDante7> "we need the trailer demo zone"
[3:47:54] <ThereIsNoJustice> I haven't seen farscape but you've convinced me to give it a try
[3:48:05] <TheDastardlyD> @CommanderSqueaks No, it bumblefucks all the way until the end
[3:48:17] <gl0vesup7> Lucas is a closet furry, this we know
[3:48:19] <InsanityMethods> @ThereIsNoJustice There's a game about that called Subverse
[3:48:35] <%CommanderSqueaks> @TheDastardlyD Also, despite the fact that his Master literally told him to only trust the Force as his last words, Cal is REALLY trusting of people.
[3:48:40] <+TheBrazilianHope> This game is hot ass I've wanted a modern star wars game for so long and it's the ultimate monkey's paw
[3:48:43] <Sokumotanaka> How many weird races does star wars have?
[3:49:01] <SirMcSlushy> How ya enjoying Jedi Souls, Plague?
[3:49:04] <%CommanderSqueaks> @TheDastardlyD You think he'd be a lot more secretive about the fact that he's a Jedi and not just tell people he just met.
[3:49:05] <%Samex_Comex> Breed with Gungan's
[3:49:07] <shinichizio> Ragdoll physics is hard enough for whole people, let alone people chunks.
[3:49:22] <+TheBrazilianHope> @SirMcSlushy this is nothing like any souls game
[3:49:25] <+Krystalsky> experience with the game does that
[3:49:31] <SirMcSlushy> I know, but its basically the formula.
[3:49:36] <TheDastardlyD> Yep being a jedi suddenly isn't dangerous and he really loves to tell everyone he is one @CommanderSqueaks
[3:49:44] <InsanityMethods> I still wonder how Jedi Academy and Force Unleashed did this better.
[3:49:49] <+TheBrazilianHope> It's more uncharted than souls in any sense
[3:49:58] <SirMcSlushy> Nah
[3:50:02] <+TheBrazilianHope> tomb raider / god of war / nothing original
[3:50:09] <Tiny_Axolotl> These storm troppers are way to confident
[3:50:14] <+Schlomogoldbergsteinowitz> this is like code vein, and code vein is another soul's like, hence this is soul's like
[3:50:18] <%CommanderSqueaks> Like, the moment a single Storm Trooper sees a lightsaber, there should be an entire fleet of Inquisitors sprinting across the galaxy to get him.
[3:50:27] <shinichizio> Ah, now HERE is a Souls feature. One-way drops.
[3:50:28] <+TheBrazilianHope> It's definitely NOTHING like souls in any sense
[3:50:32] <gl0vesup7> @sokumotanaka almost too much
[3:50:36] <SirMcSlushy> Ya wrong
[3:50:38] <shinichizio> Especially when you're a jedi, the religion known for jumping.
[3:50:39] <SirMcSlushy> But k
[3:50:45] <+TheBrazilianHope> explain 2 me
[3:50:48] <+TheBrazilianHope> how it is
[3:50:58] <+TheBrazilianHope> LUL
[3:51:03] <%Samex_Comex> Holy shit!
[3:51:07] <lewdnekojam> holy crap a miracle
[3:51:10] <shinichizio> Not a Souls game confirmed!
[3:51:12] <%CommanderSqueaks> Cal used his force powers for ONE second in the start of the game to make something happen that could easily be chocked up to chance and that was enough to instantly attract the Inquistor, now he's throwing his beam sword balls around willy nilly and nothing happens.
[3:51:30] <+Schlomogoldbergsteinowitz> don't worry, the game will let you down later FeelsBadMan
[3:51:39] <SirMcSlushy> Dodges, melee combat where you avoid enemies, parries, deflecting projeciles to close distance.
[3:52:01] <%StridentSong> StridentSong subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 3 months, currently on a 3 month streak! 
[3:52:24] <gl0vesup7> Do Jedi get any fun force powers?
[3:52:30] <+Schlomogoldbergsteinowitz> no
[3:52:33] <+Krystalsky> @CommanderSqueaks if u notice in that cinematic there is a observer droid in the background that saw the whole thing
[3:52:43] <+Schlomogoldbergsteinowitz> just the lame force powers
[3:52:45] <+TheBrazilianHope> Dodging is hardly a souls mechanic, neither is melee combat L O L. And deflecting projectiles only exists in dark souls 2 and it's extremely jank.
[3:52:45] <SirMcSlushy> Tbf 3d action games are all so simple in their concept and universally similar you can compare any of them between each other.
[3:52:49] <%CommanderSqueaks> @Krystalsky Why aren't there observer droids literally anywhere else?
[3:53:14] <%CommanderSqueaks> @SirMcSlushy -Flabergasted white dude blinking .gif-
[3:53:21] <+TheBrazilianHope> You can but you shouldn't because they aren't similar at all especially when playing them they feel nothing alike.
[3:53:25] <+Krystalsky> @CommanderSqueaks no idea why one was that close to that pit but it was there
[3:53:27] <gl0vesup7> So I guess the Jedi is just the religion of push and pull
[3:53:35] <SirMcSlushy> I've made the comparisons
[3:53:45] <+TheBrazilianHope> Ya but they were bad is my point
[3:53:51] <+Schlomogoldbergsteinowitz> I'm sorry, I just finished this game and I am aggressively biased against it
[3:53:55] <SirMcSlushy> 'Bad'
[3:53:58] <SirMcSlushy> Sure :p
[3:54:02] <+TheBrazilianHope> Ya
[3:54:05] <SirMcSlushy> If ya say so
[3:54:07] <%CommanderSqueaks> Jedi can get a lot of cool illusionary powers and push and pull can get some leverage, but also a lot of their powers don't have direct combat applications... and yeah that doesn't work for this kind of game.
[3:54:09] <+TheBrazilianHope> I do
[3:54:11] <+TheBrazilianHope> :)
[3:54:15] <SirMcSlushy> But ya wrong
[3:54:27] <+TheBrazilianHope> no u
[3:54:34] <%CommanderSqueaks> Oh my god.
[3:54:40] <SirMcSlushy> Pfft
[3:54:46] <%CommanderSqueaks> What the fuck is this game.
[3:54:50] <SirMcSlushy> Just creepin
[3:55:02] <+TheBrazilianHope> It's far closer to a dozen other titles
[3:55:05] <InsanityMethods> KOTOR2 did a good breakdown of force powers.
[3:55:09] <gl0vesup7> LUL
[3:55:10] <lewdnekojam> beating your enemies through invisble walls truelly the jedi way
[3:55:26] <+TheBrazilianHope> Yes they do that often LUL
[3:55:28] <gl0vesup7> There was a force barrier there
[3:55:32] <tiger_guard> not in DS2 they don't
[3:55:34] <tiger_guard> XD
[3:55:39] <%CommanderSqueaks> I don't think it's an invisible wall, I think the models collision boxes are just too big to go through the door.
[3:55:49] <+TheBrazilianHope> Just wait FeelsBadMan
[3:55:57] <InsanityMethods> My friends say it's a 6/10 at best.
[3:56:22] <+TheBrazilianHope> KOTOR 2 was unfinished it got pushed out broken.
[3:56:31] <+Schlomogoldbergsteinowitz> 7/10 if you like the stear wears, 5/10 if you don't
[3:56:32] <+Schlomogoldbergsteinowitz> easy
[3:56:35] <%CommanderSqueaks> Wait.
[3:56:43] <NoHueManatee> KOTOR 2 was super rushed
[3:56:43] <%CommanderSqueaks> No Storm Troopers here yet, as monsters eat a fresh Storm Trooper corpse.
[3:56:49] <%CommanderSqueaks> Da fuq?
[3:57:08] <gl0vesup7> Is kotor 2 bad or just worse than 1
[3:57:19] <+TheBrazilianHope> The academy game you had dozens of weapons and force powers and you could dismember limbs and leave marks on the walls PepeHands
[3:57:35] <InsanityMethods> KOTOR 2 in terms of story is solid. There's just technical aspects that are busted in it and require patches.
[3:57:43] <%CommanderSqueaks> @gl0vesup7 The game is great, just a technical buggy mess and it's CLEARLY rushed at the end.
[3:57:46] <Sokumotanaka> HA
[3:57:55] <gl0vesup7> Ahh I see
[3:57:58] <Sokumotanaka> EA smart
[3:58:20] <%CommanderSqueaks> Oh my god, I love how the model kept its arms and legs up like it was still being eaten.
[3:58:21] <shinichizio> Oh, so you can cut monsters in half, but not people? I see how it is, video games. catonBaka
[3:58:26] <lewdnekojam> >EA doing wise long-term financial investments
[3:58:55] <%CommanderSqueaks> Also, didn't Cal say in the beginning that he can't meditate cause he's all fucked up? How is he able to meditate all the time now?
[3:59:19] <%CommanderSqueaks> Did the game just forget that Cal said that?
[3:59:35] <gl0vesup7> @commandersqueaks Force video game mechanics
[4:00:25] <lewdnekojam> force awakins had the best force physics mechanics
[4:00:28] <%CommanderSqueaks> I feel like there's a huge disconnect between what the story is telling you SHOULD happen and what the gameplay is showing you.
[4:00:54] <gl0vesup7> LUL
[4:00:56] <Uncle_Wizard> yes
[4:00:57] <InsanityMethods> @lewdnekojam Did you mean Force Unleashed?
[4:01:05] <lewdnekojam> hey they are the empire
[4:01:20] <lewdnekojam> @InsanityMethods oh sorry you are right thank you for correcting me
[4:01:22] <%CommanderSqueaks> Real talk, I would totally use the ice slide.
[4:01:26] <ThereIsNoJustice> storm troopers just hanging out having a good time
[4:01:30] <+Krystalsky> @CommanderSqueaks he said he doesnt meditate cause his connection to the force is damaged and there is a chance of him destroying things around him
[4:01:38] <InsanityMethods> @lewdnekojam No worries!
[4:01:46] <%CommanderSqueaks> @Krystalsky And about 10 minutes later he's meditating and having no problems at all.
[4:01:57] <StonerStan101> @PlagueOfGripes Vader did nothing wrong.
[4:02:03] <+Krystalsky> @CommanderSqueaks hes also in the wild not near people
[4:02:20] <+Krystalsky> the only med point that doesnt make sense really is the one on the ship
[4:02:38] <gl0vesup7> Remember when Vader murdered those children
[4:02:38] <%CommanderSqueaks> Isn't the Force EVERYWHERE and not just connected to people, so it shouldn't matter where he is?
[4:02:43] <gl0vesup7> Good times
[4:03:11] <+Krystalsky> im saying because hes not near people he doesnt worry about hurting anyone
[4:03:25] <shinichizio> All those force-connected trees and rocks and birds had it coming.
[4:03:50] <MrDante7> the way that works, is that the green unlocks the red
[4:03:56] <MrDante7> its not very clear
[4:04:13] <InsanityMethods> Disney/EA just aren't good at keeping the Force consistent I suppose.
[4:04:22] <%CommanderSqueaks> @Krystalsky Like fuck it, just show an animation of him looking or shifting around uncomfortably whenever you meditate, give me something.
[4:04:28] <gl0vesup7> LUL
[4:04:30] <InsanityMethods> Cal's Force Echo power was only there to excuse Rey really.
[4:04:45] <gl0vesup7> Don’t give up, Skeleton!
[4:04:54] <lewdnekojam> maybe the skeleton is just taking a power nap?
[4:05:31] <+Krystalsky> @InsanityMethods they have actually said that hte only reason they made a male protag is so they didnt have to compete with rey
[4:05:32] <TakesGuts> plague how may hours into the game are you?
[4:06:06] <%Samex_Comex> Poor cave troll
[4:06:11] <%CommanderSqueaks> The game had a bunch of super interesting plot threads and potentials in the first few minutes and all of that interest has just evaporated.
[4:06:12] <MrDante7> he eats the respawning goats and rats
[4:06:18] <InsanityMethods> @Krystalsky I can't imagine they're too happy that Ashsoka gets more attention and love than Rey.
[4:06:20] <Geoddox> give it two years and george lucas will write a book about him
[4:06:37] <seth45er> how does he swim with the tiny legs
[4:06:39] <lewdnekojam> eats shit fish and lives in a shit condo?
[4:06:43] <$sleepy_coffee> eww, what's that metallic tumor on your back
[4:06:50] <tiger_guard> well remember the trolls in the first section of DS2 near the gender bending coffin? :P
[4:07:05] <ThereIsNoJustice> he eats lightsaber clearly
[4:07:07] <+Krystalsky> @InsanityMethods lol prob. there was also talk about making a alien protag but i cant remember the reason they didnt do that one
[4:07:17] <%CommanderSqueaks> @tiger_guard I literally didn't know what that did and cause I was already hollowed and covered in armor, I didn't realize I had turned into a woman until 3 hours later.
[4:07:35] <InsanityMethods> @Krystalsky It would require slightly more creativity to make an alien protag than a human one.
[4:07:52] <InsanityMethods> They retained him I believe.
[4:07:54] <StonerStan101> For the clones?
[4:07:57] <gl0vesup7> What’s the in game explanation for respawning enemies
[4:08:13] <%CommanderSqueaks> @gl0vesup7 Dark Souls did it.
[4:08:14] <cerazor01> It's a sound alike
[4:08:15] <StonerStan101> They had the same actor.
[4:08:24] <+misterfistor> this map screen is fucking terrible color-wise. at least make it a different color so they dont blend in together
[4:08:38] <gl0vesup7> @commandersqueaks lol
[4:08:48] <cerazor01> It's not the original guy
[4:08:50] <MrDante7> for some reason, holding your lightsaber up emits more light
[4:08:58] <cerazor01> it's a man named Dee Bradley Baker
[4:09:08] <%CommanderSqueaks> Also, WHY can you only meditate in those spots? At the first one, he says it's a good place to meditate. WHY is it a good place to meditate? What makes those specific spots special?
[4:09:11] <shinichizio> That's the light function. It's less popular than the saber function.
[4:09:22] <+misterfistor> this thing WILL rekt you. careful
[4:09:33] <gl0vesup7> He shits and sleeps here
[4:09:34] <%Samex_Comex> Poor guy fell in
[4:09:38] <$sleepy_coffee> that thing's slapping it's ass cheeks all over
[4:09:54] <lewdnekojam> i dont think he has the budget for that
[4:09:55] <%CommanderSqueaks> This game is making me more and more upset the more I think about it, AUUGH.
[4:10:04] <tiger_guard> but asylum demon species has wings
[4:10:08] <tiger_guard> I think. O.o
[4:10:09] <MrDante7> @CommanderSqueaks good thing you didn't play it :/
[4:10:33] <%CommanderSqueaks> @MrDante7 I'm mad cause I was so amped after the first cutscene and the first planet and it's all just fallen apart.
[4:10:36] <MrDante7> i get that sometimes, slow sometimes just doesn't work on those guys
[4:10:43] <gl0vesup7> @commandersqueaks Force plot holes
[4:10:56] <InsanityMethods> Have any of the old/recognisable aliens appeared in any of the new SW movies yet?
[4:10:56] <lewdnekojam> his fat can whistand the cosmic powers of space-time
[4:11:02] <+misterfistor> do a dark souls and bypass that first asylum demon
[4:11:04] <MrDante7> @CommanderSqueaks so much potential right at the beginning, only to peter out into this
[4:11:11] <InsanityMethods> Excluding Rogue One with the cameo.
[4:12:08] <%CommanderSqueaks> @MrDante7 I get the distinct feeling that the writers DID have a lot of cool ideas, but they got veto'd or twisted beyond recognition to make concessions for gameplay contrivances.
[4:12:10] <MrDante7> almost like if there was a force healing ability in the game
[4:12:16] <+misterfistor> this game would feel so much better with a fast travel instead of forcing you to trek the entire map
[4:12:24] <MrDante7> where you can sacrifice your force for health
[4:12:24] <%CommanderSqueaks> It feels like wasted potential, which is why I'm getting so tilted.
[4:12:25] <+misterfistor> you also don't need to touch that
[4:12:26] <lewdnekojam> if only a jedi had such an ablity of force to heal
[4:12:27] <MrDante7> that would be cool
[4:12:33] <ThatGuyThunder> I like how a majority of people are choosing the orange coloured lightsaber
[4:12:35] <MrDante7> @CommanderSqueaks i feel the same way
[4:12:41] <MrDante7> i think you just encountered a bug
[4:12:43] <%CommanderSqueaks> YEYEYE
[4:12:54] <shinichizio> So it repaired, but not the part that was useful. Perfect.
[4:12:58] <Geoddox> SPACE JANK
[4:13:01] <gl0vesup7> That’s the good stuff
[4:13:20] <MrDante7> @CommanderSqueaks it feels like the team really wanted to make a cool star wars game, but then EA was like, but you need to do what we say though
[4:13:21] <$sleepy_coffee> sleepy_coffee subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 5 months! Save me from this nasty freezing rain and people who can’t drive safely during the winter
[4:13:23] <arkv01> they had to strike while the irons hot
[4:13:25] <+misterfistor> railing to the left
[4:13:27] <+misterfistor> sneak
[4:13:33] <arkv01> new movies coming out, but thats gonna be a shitshow so I'm not sure why they had to use that as a deadline
[4:13:35] <%CommanderSqueaks> Like it's clear that the story and characterization took a backseat to gameplay, but the gameplay isn't even that great.
[4:13:37] <InsanityMethods> Do you think it was EA that pushed it out or Respawn themselves? I find it hard to believe it'd be the latter.
[4:14:09] <MrDante7> its the cheese the boss corner
[4:14:15] <%CommanderSqueaks> @InsanityMethods You mean who decided to have it release the same weekend as Pokemon cause that's a brilliant as fuck idea?
[4:14:26] <shinichizio> That's what this is. It's the cheese tube.
[4:14:30] <LordPubious> are these things all Rancoors?
[4:14:48] <ziggyjesus> @InsanityMethods It wouldn't be the first time Respawn got screwed by EA. Titanfall 2 was sent to die by releasing the same week as Battlefield 1
[4:14:58] <InsanityMethods> @CommanderSqueaks Sounds like an EA move considering the Titanfall 2 sabotage.
[4:15:02] <MrDante7> oh god i forgot about that @ziggyjesus
[4:15:07] <ThatGuyThunder> I’m hoping this allows respawn to continue doing titanfall 3 and another Star Wars game
[4:15:17] <gl0vesup7> @ziggyjesus god that hurts my soul
[4:15:31] <Mighty_Quaid> Is this the hardest lvl?
[4:15:34] <MrDante7> 10/10 boss fight
[4:15:38] <Geoddox> more time in the oven
[4:15:39] <%CommanderSqueaks> Okay, whoever said this game was a 6/10 earlier was GENEROUS. This game is a solid 2/10 for me so far.
[4:15:56] <+misterfistor> hole
[4:15:59] <shinichizio> Seems fun
[4:16:03] <arkv01> the wookies were the most exciting thing tonight
[4:16:06] <ziggyjesus> God, Titanfall 2 was so good, unfortunately, I don't expect to see a sequel with the success of Apex
[4:16:15] <shinichizio> There was a cuttable wall in the cheese tube down there, right?
[4:16:23] <InsanityMethods> @CommanderSqueaks That was what I'd been told. I'm not sure what to make of it still. Sits at a 5 for me.
[4:16:40] <%CommanderSqueaks> Like, we know Respawn can do cool combat, they know how to do combat, why does this game have lackluster combat?
[4:16:40] <gl0vesup7> Can’t wait until we have the second boss fight with Darth Onee-Chan
[4:16:45] <Mighty_Quaid> This game looks REALLY good
[4:16:56] <$sleepy_coffee> I’m surprised you can’t use your lightsaber to cut a hole in the wall
[4:17:36] <InsanityMethods> @CommanderSqueaks Like we said. EA probably rushed it out when it still needed refining.
[4:17:39] <Mighty_Quaid> Looks like a lot of fun
[4:18:01] <lewdnekojam> just like my parents
[4:18:08] <Uncle_Wizard> its the red hair
[4:18:13] <+misterfistor> Vore
[4:18:18] <%CommanderSqueaks> EA, Respawn is MAKING you money right now with Apex,why are you trying to actively kill your current golden goose?
[4:18:22] <Geoddox> furries
[4:18:22] <Uncle_Wizard> yes
[4:18:34] <tiger_guard> I mean aren't honeybees like that?
[4:18:39] <MrDante7> @CommanderSqueaks i have a sneaking suspicion that its because they didn't really know what they were doing with the gameplay and had to figure out a lot of things to make it and might have gone through more than one prototype
[4:19:22] <MrDante7> empire droid on a downed republic ship
[4:19:22] <ziggyjesus> I mean, they were former Modern Warfare 2 devs, and they made Titanfall, which had good gunplay. I think they're better suited for shooters than Souls-like combat
[4:19:26] <InsanityMethods> I wish EA didn't cancel the Visceral Games SW game that had Amy Hennig on board to write/direct.
[4:19:32] <gl0vesup7> EA said the game had to be out on time or no food for 2 months, Respawn slaves had to comply
[4:19:33] <Aragest> Infinite poise? This is dark souls
[4:19:37] <ThereIsNoJustice> bees are true believers in the cause
[4:19:47] <MrDante7> @ziggyjesus which is why i think why this games gameplay ended up the way it did
[4:19:58] <%CommanderSqueaks> Well, it's also very obvious that they're trying to mimic Dark Souls/ Sekiro style combat, and yeah, being rushed when you're trying to wrap your head around a style of combat that you're not experienced with could screw you.
[4:20:23] <+misterfistor> ill spoil it. that turbine serves no purpose so dont worry about it
[4:20:47] <@Nightbot> Plague is a youtube animator and also streams at https://picarto.tv/Plague . Also: t-shirts! http://goo.gl/lze8QO
[4:20:51] <%CommanderSqueaks> A Titanfall esque/Apex esque, high mobility, wall-running and jumping while slicing up Storm Troopers would be bad-ass.
[4:21:04] <ThatGuyThunder> There’s a chest at the turbine
[4:21:10] <MrDante7> @CommanderSqueaks literally a new jedi knight game, but by Respawn
[4:21:16] <%CommanderSqueaks> Just take Titanfall 2's combat and give me a lightsaber, I'm happy.
[4:21:34] <lewdnekojam> @CommanderSqueaks that would great
[4:21:58] <+misterfistor> turn the thing back on and see what changes
[4:22:19] <MrDante7> the door opens on the other side when its turned on
[4:22:20] <gl0vesup7> @commandersqueaks gOD don’t make me dream
[4:22:23] <%CommanderSqueaks> A Respawn game having shitty mobility is just baffeling to me.
[4:22:41] <+misterfistor> look at whats causing the electricity
[4:22:41] <MrDante7> you would probably have to slow the thing down and jump on it
[4:22:47] <ThatGuyThunder> Cut the electrical chord, remove electricity from water
[4:22:48] <TakesGuts> wall run on the turbine?
[4:22:57] <MrDante7> ^
[4:23:04] <MrDante7> slow down the turbine, and wallrun across it
[4:23:21] <gnollAUS> Now start the turbine
[4:23:24] <MrDante7> oh shit that probably stops the electricity
[4:23:24] <+misterfistor> now turn it back on
[4:23:26] <%CommanderSqueaks> This is like if you hired Platinum games and asked them to make a Survival Horr.... okay no that'd probabyl be awesome, nevermind.
[4:23:29] <InsanityMethods> @CommanderSqueaks EA just wanted this to fail to prove that single player games make no money and must have a multiplayer and microtransactions.
[4:23:30] <gnollAUS> that should stop the water going eletic
[4:23:36] <shinichizio> Platinum games presents Splatterhouse
[4:23:52] <+fingalights> You did it
[4:24:00] <+misterfistor> nothing
[4:24:01] <lewdnekojam> stop using your brain jedi use the force
[4:24:04] <%CommanderSqueaks> I meant more Silent Hill 2 style Survival Horror.
[4:24:13] <lewdnekojam> aka just force push everything
[4:24:17] <ThatGuyThunder> Yus
[4:24:18] <+misterfistor> nothing legit
[4:24:21] <+Lifes_A_Lich> yes
[4:24:25] <ThatGuyThunder> Now turn on the power
[4:24:33] <Mighty_Quaid> Yup
[4:24:45] <Mighty_Quaid> Bones
[4:24:45] <MrDante7> platinum games presents, Death Stranding 2
[4:24:55] <jiin6> Force hates the water
[4:24:57] <lewdnekojam> if only the empire knew that water was the greatest enemy of the jedi
[4:25:07] <+fingalights> Force is water soluble
[4:25:23] <InsanityMethods> Imagine Platinum being brought on by Square Enix to do the Soul Reaver remake.
[4:25:32] <%CommanderSqueaks> You hire Plantium Games and then tell them that the game you want them to make will have no combat mechanics whatsoever. That's what EA did with Respawn. We want you to make a game, but NOT make it focused on mobility even though that's literally the best thing you can do.
[4:26:27] <gl0vesup7> More Jedi Succ energy
[4:26:36] <MrDante7> the funny thing is that the wallrunning in this game isn't even that good
[4:26:55] <%CommanderSqueaks> @MrDante7 I know, how does Respawn fuck up wallrunning?
[4:27:10] <MrDante7> all those people were probably working on Apex
[4:27:44] <gl0vesup7> The wall running feels and looks so damn limp, like a wet noodle
[4:27:52] <+misterfistor> you can here
[4:27:57] <%CommanderSqueaks> I feel like this game was made because EA probably has a contractual obligation to release a certain number of Star Wars games a year to keep the license.
[4:28:13] <shinichizio> Even thought the central pillar is visibly not moving!
[4:28:32] <ziggyjesus> !uptime
[4:28:32] <@Nightbot> 4 hours 28 minutes 42 seconds
[4:28:49] <+zackalan> @PlagueOfGripes I assume you have already started to make a waifu of BD-1 KappaHD
[4:29:35] <%CommanderSqueaks> Can someone just mod Titanfall 2 with Star War skins and we'll pretend that's this game?
[4:29:47] <cinless> look, it's just a probe droid, its entire purpose is to find things with its sensors, you can't expect it to be able to see things 40 meters away from them
[4:29:57] <gl0vesup7> When’s robo lewds
[4:30:51] <+zackalan> @cinless it is a probe droid, but the only thing it probes is you
[4:31:19] <ThereIsNoJustice> force diarrhea
[4:31:21] <cinless> force constipation
[4:31:21] <%Samex_Comex> Fart
[4:31:26] <MrDante7> cal, thats dysentery
[4:31:35] <InsanityMethods> @CommanderSqueaks Or just mod this game to be better.
[4:31:48] <MrDante7> earthen peak
[4:31:48] <sosuke5> iron keep?
[4:31:50] <Ynkubus18> iron keep?
[4:31:58] <ziggyjesus> Earthen peak
[4:32:01] <InsanityMethods> Anor Londo Kappa
[4:32:03] <MrDante7> the elevator from earthen peak to iron keep
[4:32:07] <+zackalan> Iron keep, above the poison swamp windmill?
[4:32:13] <ziggyjesus> Heides tower of Flame
[4:32:18] <shinichizio> The sunken metal castle above the poison swamp. You know.
[4:32:26] <+zackalan> you have to overcharge it first
[4:33:07] <MrDante7> now there are two of them
[4:33:15] <sosuke5> Dragon aerie directly above aldia's keep?
[4:33:16] <cinless> imperial hug droids
[4:33:47] <gl0vesup7> For some reason, I’m just not into the cute robot buddy thing this game tries to do with BD
[4:33:58] <MrDante7> rock em sock em robots
[4:34:47] <zenith0111> Space Poncho
[4:34:55] <shinichizio> ResidentSleeper
[4:35:00] <InsanityMethods> I appreciate BD just because of the whole BT thing in Titanfall 2, but it's missing something.
[4:35:01] <cinless> how ratchet and clank of them
[4:35:02] <+zackalan> head back up that zipline
[4:35:07] <+zackalan> with the elevator
[4:35:35] <%Samex_Comex> Wait a minute your Ratchet and Clank
[4:35:52] <ziggyjesus> BD should have been a heavily armed bipedal robot, that would make him more memorable
[4:36:19] <zenith0111> @samex_comex PogChamp
[4:36:32] <MrDante7> you should have been playing as a robot hunting down jedi
[4:36:49] <ziggyjesus> @Samex_Comex Looking at them, Cal and BD have NO personality. Seriously, play the first Ratchet and Clank and see how they banter and interact
[4:37:00] <zenith0111> People don't just want a lightsaber in a Star Wars game.
[4:37:04] <MrDante7> 👏
[4:37:28] <InsanityMethods> @MrDante7 Wasn't that Amy Hennig's SW game before EA cancelled it?
[4:37:58] <gl0vesup7> I want an HK 47 to my ginger boy
[4:38:20] <+fingalights> lol, so nonchalant "He's Killing us"
[4:38:27] <InsanityMethods> Ginger boy just wants to rule over Gotham.
[4:38:35] <MrDante7> kinda yeah, but moreso i just want 1313
[4:38:45] <+misterfistor> oh dont you worry
[4:38:55] <LeChevaliere> We're not savages!
[4:39:00] <+zackalan> Can you jerk them off?
[4:39:16] <MrDante7> thats the only proper way to murder a man with a lightsaber
[4:39:24] <+fingalights> Very slowly
[4:39:30] <jiin6> jedi academy was so much fun with force grip lvl 3
[4:39:30] <zenith0111> KreyGasm
[4:39:32] <ThereIsNoJustice> I saw that in bone tomahawk
[4:39:50] <%Samex_Comex> They need more lightsabers in church
[4:39:57] <zenith0111> LUL
[4:40:10] <cinless> i think cal is just kinda a weak bitch actually
[4:40:19] <gl0vesup7> If this game was just Force Unleashed with Mortal Kombat fatalities I would be all in
[4:40:23] <MrDante7> i can attest that probe droids are terrible on the hardest difficulty
[4:40:27] <+fingalights> What if you choke yourself ?
[4:40:29] <MrDante7> i checked
[4:40:36] <+misterfistor> cal stunted at padawan so he kinda should be
[4:40:50] <@Nightbot> Plague is a youtube animator and also streams at https://picarto.tv/Plague . Also: t-shirts! http://goo.gl/lze8QO
[4:40:53] <jiin6> think there was a jedi that self choked himself?
[4:41:06] <zenith0111> rmzGASM Probably
[4:41:13] <Ynkubus18> jedi sutra
[4:41:20] <MrDante7> @jiin6 there are probably a lot of jedi with autoerotic asphyxiation fetishes
[4:41:41] <+Coldfoxvii> even though if light sabers were real just touching someone it'll result in them exploding
[4:41:59] <gl0vesup7> @jiin6 that’s where the erotic fan fiction comes into play
[4:42:46] <gl0vesup7> LUL the game did it 3 times now
[4:42:50] <zenith0111> MrDestructoid Father why did you program me to feel loneliness and pain
[4:43:02] <+zackalan> Hey plague, I know what would cheer you up, talking about akira toriyama's writing! :D
[4:43:09] <Fredcome2bed> never thought of it that way
[4:43:40] <+misterfistor> you got force powers babe
[4:43:46] <MrDante7> yeah the problem is that they don't fight with the same rules you have
[4:43:59] <zenith0111> Chatty Cathys
[4:44:01] <shalashasknya> Is he getting off to this fight? Like what are these lines?
[4:44:03] <ziggyjesus> nice 180 turn
[4:44:22] <MrDante7> the tracking is really really strong in this game
[4:44:32] <shalashasknya> "Yes, try to resist"
[4:44:43] <gl0vesup7> The tracking is almost ds2 level
[4:44:51] <ThereIsNoJustice> also the chatty cathy lines say the opposite things back to back
[4:44:57] <tiger_guard> like the pursuer's grab attack
[4:45:01] <ThereIsNoJustice> "stop resisting!" "yes resist more!"
[4:45:08] <InsanityMethods> You don't need a Force power to make these deductions.
[4:45:13] <MrDante7> more jedi should just have blasters on them
[4:45:16] <+fingalights> So uncivilized
[4:45:20] <OlmStranger> Are jedi not allowed firearms?
[4:45:23] <MrDante7> you need to know how to pull
[4:45:25] <shinichizio> Sometimes it's handy to shoot things.
[4:45:29] <MrDante7> you aren't trained enough to know how to do it
[4:45:50] <InsanityMethods> In the old EU, Luke implemented lightsaber/blaster combat into his training.
[4:45:56] <+misterfistor> they kinda explained he's got PTSD and can't do stuff, you know
[4:45:56] <gl0vesup7> I want a Jedi to just ice a bitch on the spot
[4:46:05] <MrDante7> jedi would have such and advantage if they just used guns
[4:46:06] <tiger_guard> they are like batman
[4:46:12] <Uncle_Wizard> honor code
[4:46:17] <Tubit> weight reduction?
[4:46:23] <ziggyjesus> Of course it doesn't make sense
[4:46:24] <arkv01> guns are lethal, lightsabers are... optionally lethal
[4:46:26] <tiger_guard> I think a gun and a sword combo would be cool
[4:46:39] <+zackalan> Phallic imagery
[4:46:40] <InsanityMethods> As dumb as Ezra's blaster/lightsaber is, it works and makes sense for that purpose.
[4:46:41] <jiin6> they had stun guns in the EU
[4:46:43] <zenith0111> Obi-Wan used guns
[4:46:44] <+fingalights> Why don't they have a stunsaber
[4:46:49] <MrDante7> jedi don't have enough less than lethal methods of combat
[4:47:05] <InsanityMethods> Ezra's blaster saber stunned iirc.
[4:47:13] <+zackalan> the motion blur on that rope looks bad
[4:47:20] <%Samex_Comex> Swing on the noodle
[4:47:31] <+misterfistor> wait plague heal
[4:47:51] <ThereIsNoJustice> the force is the jedi gun kinda
[4:48:04] <Mikers29> light saber bayonet
[4:48:05] <MrDante7> @ThereIsNoJustice but imagine if a jedi combined a gun and the force
[4:48:06] <zenith0111> Force Gun PogChamp
[4:48:31] <%PharmCat> I guess why bother with the gun if you need the light saber.
[4:48:39] <MrDante7> like fucking vader didn't even need a saber to stop blaster bolts, fuck a lightsaber
[4:48:40] <marlowe86> I think Jedi do not use guns because they were all about only using the force and your other abilities for defense only.
[4:48:40] <InsanityMethods> Lightwhips are still the dumbest thing from the old EU. I'm glad they're gone.
[4:49:11] <gl0vesup7> DARTH ONEE-CHAN
[4:49:15] <senfood> She's so cute!
[4:49:16] <Uncle_Wizard> "mom?"
[4:49:29] <arkv01> please impale me darth nee-chan Kreygasm
[4:49:34] <trianglehat> merely a scratch
[4:49:42] <+zackalan> If she is called sister, would dating her be considered winces? Kreygasm
[4:49:54] <zenith0111> Mmm that... helmet swifta6Shy
[4:50:02] <InsanityMethods> Calling her Ni-San makes more sense.
[4:50:06] <marlowe86> As far as nonlethal I think with all the different species you could not carry just one or a few devices.
[4:50:10] <+fingalights> She's great
[4:50:29] <jiin6> no wonder you didn't finish jedi school
[4:51:02] <InsanityMethods> The grand inquisitor was. I can't say for sure about the other inquisitors.
[4:51:27] <senfood> Yep. Inquisitors are ex-Jedi who were brought over to the dark side for various reasons. Some went willingly, others were tortured and brainwashed.
[4:51:28] <+FunkyRot> the second edgelord
[4:51:44] <marlowe86> Force gun would be like a magnetic accelerator gun with the force taking the place of the magnetic field.
[4:51:50] <zenith0111> So is Cal going to lose his arm? rmzTHINK
[4:52:01] <MrDante7> so youre telling me jedi should be using gauss rifles
[4:52:07] <senfood> Say what you will about new SW canon, Inquisitors were a good idea.
[4:52:19] <grander76> mikiri counter the stab
[4:52:41] <zenith0111> Compliments? cantaHehe
[4:52:54] <%PharmCat> As long as the inquisitors don't have fucking helicopter sabers
[4:52:59] <ziggyjesus> Plot twist, Second sister is the padawan
[4:53:02] <senfood> She's so CUTE!
[4:53:02] <%Samex_Comex> Be hot be hot be hot
[4:53:03] <+zackalan> So wait, did she just diss herself?
[4:53:12] <jiin6> i don't get it, still creepy
[4:53:17] <MrDante7> why doesn't she keep the helmet on
[4:53:22] <InsanityMethods> Who is she? Why does she matter?
[4:53:22] <gl0vesup7> Look at all that eyeliner
[4:53:27] <InsanityMethods> Why are you being like Kylo?
[4:53:31] <InsanityMethods> Keep the helmet on.
[4:53:33] <+zackalan> Cere's pug eyes still creep me out
[4:53:38] <zenith0111> Believe the person who tried to kill you LUL
[4:53:42] <arkv01> deliciously evil
[4:53:43] <+misterfistor> Cal is 16 at most, i think. his hormones are RAGING
[4:53:48] <tiger_guard> oh no the dark side
[4:53:49] <ziggyjesus> Ehhhhh, not feeling it, keep the helmet on
[4:53:55] <jiin6> Cere's Eyes are the DARKEST Thing about her
[4:54:01] <ziggyjesus> That nose tho
[4:54:04] <InsanityMethods> Cal is just wishing he could go back to Gotham and be The Joker again.
[4:54:12] <ziggyjesus> and hairline
[4:54:14] <Mighty_Quaid> She is cute
[4:54:21] <senfood> Yeah, Cal's underbite bothers me.
[4:54:24] <arkv01> whys she even got eyeliner on? Is she trying to get on that vader dick?
[4:54:26] <Eirykr> Star Wars is all about having ugly actors now
[4:54:27] <+zackalan> How can ginger's use then force? they don't have a soul
[4:54:29] <+FunkyRot> why drop the helmet?
[4:54:34] <+zackalan> gingers
[4:54:35] <Eirykr> No more lookers, all uggos all the time
[4:54:35] <jiin6> of dumbjeditis
[4:54:35] <zenith0111> @insanitymethods The didn't get the Rights so hes "Not Joker" LUL
[4:54:36] <Dutchpotato> Man these impenetrable force fields that let sound last through are perfect information dumps
[4:54:42] <Dutchpotato> Past through*
[4:54:48] <+misterfistor> he doesn't have that underbite irl. its weird how they scanned these to look so weird
[4:54:54] <InsanityMethods> @zenith0111 Jerome then.
[4:55:09] <ziggyjesus> So far, the night sister we met is the most attractive person we met
[4:55:29] <tiger_guard> you mean the ninth sister Kappa
[4:55:57] <gl0vesup7> All of the face scans in this game look horrendous
[4:55:57] <+misterfistor> sheev is delicious
[4:56:01] <zenith0111> rmzDEVIL
[4:56:31] <+fingalights> He LOVES the darkside
[4:56:39] <senfood> Sheev is a muppet.
[4:56:54] <senfood> She has being cute!
[4:56:58] <zenith0111> SeriousSloth Join the Darkside... we evil
[4:57:21] <+misterfistor> thanks for not letting us have this Rian :)
[4:57:23] <Dutchpotato> But she’s got a cool red lightsaber Kappa that’s a character trait
[4:57:29] <%PharmCat> I love Sheev. He just takes so much pleasure in being evil. He's flat as hell, but entertaining.
[4:57:38] <senfood> Star Wars has always been at its best when the Force isn't binary.
[4:58:03] <InsanityMethods> KOTOR 2 still did that well.
[4:58:17] <arkv01> evil sex tho
[4:58:59] <arkv01> problem was han still had a tiny spark of heart of gold
[4:59:15] <InsanityMethods> Qui Gon and Ahsoka's opinions of the Force and the Jedi as a whole is good too.
[4:59:17] <zenith0111> RuleFive
[4:59:22] <%PharmCat> Is it really murder when a gun is trained on you? Seems like self defense to me.
[4:59:31] <senfood> aw yeah baby talk evil to me while I metroid
[4:59:33] <InsanityMethods> Even Rebels had a good example with the Bendu(?)
[4:59:47] <arkv01> why is she giving us ASMR therapy
[4:59:55] <Dutchpotato> LUL ok that’s fun. Is she just gonna whisper in your ear and taunt you now?
[4:59:57] <zenith0111> Jumping vines looks janky LUL
